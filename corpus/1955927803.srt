00:00:42,674 --> 00:00:45,474
Who cares about
winning? Let's get drunk!

3
00:00:45,476 --> 00:00:46,843
<i>Now we're going
into the lightning round.</i>

4
00:00:46,845 --> 00:00:48,578
Let's do it.

5
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:50,112
<i>So from now on, you'll
be shouting out your answers.</i>

6
00:00:50,114 --> 00:00:50,880
Get you drunk, Merkins.
You too, Borgs.

7
00:00:50,882 --> 00:00:53,316
I'm thirsty. Huh?

8
00:00:53,318 --> 00:00:55,618
I need four shots of vodka,
four shots of water.

9
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:57,554
I want you to send the vodka
over to the Merkins'.

10
00:00:57,556 --> 00:00:59,489
Send the water to us.
You understand?

11
00:00:59,491 --> 00:01:01,325
<i>What former
Supreme Court Justice...</i>

12
00:01:01,327 --> 00:01:03,260
- Oliver Wendell Holmes!
- <i>Correct.</i>

13
00:01:03,262 --> 00:01:04,593
Yes!

14
00:01:04,595 --> 00:01:07,230
<i>Again, I'd like to ask
the players to allow me to...</i>

15
00:01:07,232 --> 00:01:08,463
To finish the question.

16
00:01:08,465 --> 00:01:10,499
<i>Very funny.</i>

17
00:01:10,501 --> 00:01:12,769
Okay, okay.
This is getting embarrassing.

18
00:01:12,771 --> 00:01:14,804
So we need to focus.

19
00:01:14,806 --> 00:01:16,439
'Cause this isn't a game.

20
00:01:16,441 --> 00:01:18,040
It literally is.

21
00:01:18,042 --> 00:01:20,310
Bill, do not test me
right now.

22
00:01:20,312 --> 00:01:22,579
<i>Looks like we're
down to two teams.</i>

23
00:01:22,581 --> 00:01:24,647
<i>So for double points,</i>

24
00:01:24,649 --> 00:01:27,650
<i>what is the name
of the purple Teletubby?</i>

25
00:01:27,652 --> 00:01:30,488
- Tinky Winky!
- <i>You're both correct.</i>

26
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:33,722
He always carried a...

27
00:01:33,724 --> 00:01:35,457
- Red purse.
- Yeah.

28
00:01:35,459 --> 00:01:38,061
- And he loved big hugs.
- Big hugs.

29
00:01:38,063 --> 00:01:40,564
I know. I'm Max.

30
00:01:40,566 --> 00:01:42,064
Annie.

31
00:01:59,584 --> 00:02:00,883
Ha-ha! You're never
gonna be able to

32
00:02:00,885 --> 00:02:02,352
hold on to Asia! You hear me?

33
00:02:02,354 --> 00:02:04,219
Hey, if you take Kamchatka,
and I take Mongolia,

34
00:02:04,221 --> 00:02:05,489
we could trap Linda
in the middle.

35
00:02:05,491 --> 00:02:06,755
- <i>Starve out her armies.</i>
- Hey!

36
00:02:06,757 --> 00:02:07,957
You can't form alliances.

37
00:02:07,959 --> 00:02:10,092
Worked for Hitler, right? Hmm?

38
00:02:10,094 --> 00:02:12,063
You're high-fiving Hitler?

39
00:02:13,731 --> 00:02:16,199
<i>All right,
you got this. Last one.</i>

40
00:02:16,201 --> 00:02:19,301
Oh, that's <i>Twilight Saga:
Breaking Dawn.</i>

41
00:02:19,303 --> 00:02:20,703
Yes!

42
00:02:20,705 --> 00:02:21,871
I'm up, I feel good.

43
00:02:21,873 --> 00:02:23,039
Two words.

44
00:02:23,041 --> 00:02:24,775
Bill. Overweight.

45
00:02:24,777 --> 00:02:26,009
- No.
- Single. Out of work.

46
00:02:26,011 --> 00:02:27,076
What the fuck?

47
00:02:27,078 --> 00:02:28,610
Hairy.

48
00:02:28,612 --> 00:02:30,347
Carry, marry.

49
00:02:30,349 --> 00:02:31,480
Marry!

50
00:02:31,482 --> 00:02:33,550
You. Me.

51
00:02:33,552 --> 00:02:34,683
<i>Marry me?</i>

52
00:02:34,685 --> 00:02:36,552
Dude, we got it! We got it!

53
00:02:36,554 --> 00:02:38,253
Annie, will you?

54
00:02:38,255 --> 00:02:39,588
Will you marry me?

55
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:41,790
- Is that a yes? That's a yes!
- Yeah!

56
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:44,394
I'm really happy for you guys.

57
00:02:57,541 --> 00:02:59,474
- Lot of pressure here.
- Yeah.

58
00:02:59,476 --> 00:03:01,044
You miss,
you lose it all.

59
00:03:01,046 --> 00:03:02,412
Stay outta my head.

60
00:03:02,414 --> 00:03:03,445
And you know you have
a distinct advantage

61
00:03:03,447 --> 00:03:04,647
with the smaller hands, right?

62
00:03:04,649 --> 00:03:06,316
Your goal posts
are not as big.

63
00:03:06,318 --> 00:03:07,516
Well, I guess you
should've married Uma Thurman.

64
00:03:07,518 --> 00:03:08,683
Yeah, that would've
been great.

65
00:03:08,685 --> 00:03:09,785
There's a snap,

66
00:03:09,787 --> 00:03:10,953
here's the hold.

67
00:03:10,955 --> 00:03:12,955
- Ooh!
- And a text.

68
00:03:12,957 --> 00:03:14,591
That was interference.

69
00:03:14,593 --> 00:03:16,025
<i>Sorry, honey. I know
how much that meant to you.</i>

70
00:03:16,027 --> 00:03:18,593
- Come on.
- Dr. Chin is ready for you.

71
00:03:18,595 --> 00:03:20,096
Uh, great.

72
00:03:20,098 --> 00:03:21,698
I think we've determined
why you've been

73
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:22,866
having trouble conceiving.

74
00:03:22,868 --> 00:03:25,034
- Okay. Let's have it.
- Okay, great.

75
00:03:25,036 --> 00:03:28,070
Oh, what's that look? Is it me?
Of course it's me.

76
00:03:28,072 --> 00:03:30,039
I'm not loving your semen.

77
00:03:30,041 --> 00:03:32,175
- Oh?
- <i>Your count is excellent,</i>

78
00:03:32,177 --> 00:03:34,443
<i>but your motility
is well below normal.</i>

79
00:03:34,445 --> 00:03:36,412
- That's too bad.
- What would cause that?

80
00:03:36,414 --> 00:03:39,549
It can be genetic,
environmental factors.

81
00:03:39,551 --> 00:03:41,852
Nine times out of 10, though,
it's psychological.

82
00:03:41,854 --> 00:03:44,653
Have you been feeling
anxious or stressed?

83
00:03:44,655 --> 00:03:46,355
No, I don't think so.
Not really.

84
00:03:46,357 --> 00:03:49,126
Uh...
He's always a little stressed.

85
00:03:49,128 --> 00:03:50,794
You don't have to write...
I'm not...

86
00:03:50,796 --> 00:03:51,927
Honey, she's writing it down.

87
00:03:51,929 --> 00:03:54,430
Well, Max is very competitive.

88
00:03:54,432 --> 00:03:55,498
As am I.

89
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:56,598
We sure are.

90
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,134
One of the reasons
I fell in love with him.

91
00:03:58,136 --> 00:03:59,568
Maybe that makes him
a little more prone

92
00:03:59,570 --> 00:04:02,271
to stress than normal people.

93
00:04:02,273 --> 00:04:03,505
"Normal people"?

94
00:04:03,507 --> 00:04:05,342
How long has this
been going on, Max?

95
00:04:05,344 --> 00:04:06,876
It's not going on.

96
00:04:06,878 --> 00:04:09,679
Oh, well, you did say
even when you were a kid,

97
00:04:09,681 --> 00:04:11,948
you would freak out
if you lost at anything.

98
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:13,181
Oh, I was a kid.

99
00:04:13,183 --> 00:04:14,717
Especially if you lost
to your brother.

100
00:04:14,719 --> 00:04:16,185
Hmm.

101
00:04:16,187 --> 00:04:18,086
Hey, is that what this is?

102
00:04:18,088 --> 00:04:19,155
No.

103
00:04:19,157 --> 00:04:20,589
You have been so uptight

104
00:04:20,591 --> 00:04:22,391
since you found out that
Brooks is coming to town.

105
00:04:22,393 --> 00:04:24,060
I don't think that's true.

106
00:04:24,062 --> 00:04:25,562
- Could that be a factor in all this?
- Let's be fair.

107
00:04:25,564 --> 00:04:28,165
Sibling rivalry
can be very powerful.

108
00:04:28,167 --> 00:04:30,333
Cain and Abel, the Baldwins.

109
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:31,867
- The what?
- The brothers.

110
00:04:31,869 --> 00:04:33,435
I'm not sure
why we're discussing this.

111
00:04:33,437 --> 00:04:34,903
She's not a therapist.

112
00:04:34,905 --> 00:04:37,105
You're not a therapist, right?
With all respect.

113
00:04:37,107 --> 00:04:38,673
- No, but I am a doctor.
- Sure.

114
00:04:38,675 --> 00:04:40,610
And I believe in treating
the whole patient.

115
00:04:40,612 --> 00:04:42,345
So, what is it
about your brother

116
00:04:42,347 --> 00:04:44,280
that makes you
feel emasculated?

117
00:04:44,282 --> 00:04:45,749
Are we gonna do this?

118
00:04:45,751 --> 00:04:47,483
We're right next to the room
where I masturbated.

119
00:04:47,485 --> 00:04:50,754
I think he has it in his head
that Brooks is cooler

120
00:04:50,756 --> 00:04:53,956
and more successful
and hotter than he is.

121
00:04:53,958 --> 00:04:55,158
I never said "hotter."

122
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,658
He's charming.

123
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:59,261
That's interesting.
And is he single?

124
00:04:59,263 --> 00:05:00,596
What's that?

125
00:05:00,598 --> 00:05:01,898
I don't know
if I mentioned it,

126
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:03,932
but Keith and I
are on a trial separation.

127
00:05:03,934 --> 00:05:05,300
- Oh.
- Keith?

128
00:05:05,302 --> 00:05:07,136
Uh, Keith.

129
00:05:07,138 --> 00:05:09,238
So, do you think your brother would
wanna grab a cup of coffee with me?

130
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,406
Gosh, I don't know.

131
00:05:10,408 --> 00:05:11,973
Well, it doesn't hurt to ask.

132
00:05:11,975 --> 00:05:13,343
Hurts a little.

133
00:05:13,345 --> 00:05:16,379
Now, is he a tall fella?
'Cause I'm only 5'2".

134
00:05:16,381 --> 00:05:17,913
We're all done with my semen?

135
00:05:17,915 --> 00:05:19,382
He is taller than Max.

136
00:05:19,384 --> 00:05:20,749
<i>Good.</i>

137
00:05:20,751 --> 00:05:22,252
But he did date
this ballerina once,

138
00:05:22,254 --> 00:05:23,422
and she was just
a teeny-tiny little thing.

139
00:05:43,107 --> 00:05:45,307
Ooh.
Honey, Gary.

140
00:05:45,309 --> 00:05:46,742
Don't mention
game night, okay?

141
00:05:46,744 --> 00:05:47,744
Mmm-hmm.

142
00:05:47,746 --> 00:05:49,511
- Good evening, Max.
- Hey, Gary.

143
00:05:49,513 --> 00:05:50,980
- Annie.
- Hello there.

144
00:05:50,982 --> 00:05:53,182
Hi, Gary!

145
00:05:53,184 --> 00:05:54,884
Just checking the mail.

146
00:05:54,886 --> 00:05:56,218
Oh, yeah?

147
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:57,285
Some people check it
earlier in the day,

148
00:05:57,287 --> 00:05:58,588
but there's always a risk

149
00:05:58,590 --> 00:06:01,891
that the mail carrier
hasn't come yet.

150
00:06:01,893 --> 00:06:06,564
This spares me the chance of
a futile trip to the mailbox.

151
00:06:08,165 --> 00:06:09,764
Uh-huh.

152
00:06:09,766 --> 00:06:13,838
Plus, it allows Bastian here
the opportunity to urinate.

153
00:06:14,905 --> 00:06:16,605
You have a good one.

154
00:06:16,607 --> 00:06:18,107
Any plans for this evening?

155
00:06:18,109 --> 00:06:20,042
No.

156
00:06:20,044 --> 00:06:21,509
Perhaps a game night?

157
00:06:21,511 --> 00:06:22,677
We're just gonna stay in,

158
00:06:22,679 --> 00:06:24,314
- just the two of us.
- Mmm-hmm.

159
00:06:24,316 --> 00:06:26,182
- Boring.
- Mmm.

160
00:06:26,184 --> 00:06:28,617
I see.

161
00:06:28,619 --> 00:06:32,891
I do hope you keep me in mind
for any future game nights.

162
00:06:33,758 --> 00:06:35,089
You bet.

163
00:06:35,091 --> 00:06:38,627
I've always enjoyed the
camaraderie of good friends

164
00:06:38,629 --> 00:06:42,230
competing in games
of chance and skill.

165
00:06:42,232 --> 00:06:44,968
Yeah. Yeah, well,
we'll do that,

166
00:06:44,970 --> 00:06:49,338
but tonight it's just
the two of us.

167
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:52,611
Three bags of Tostitos Scoops,
I notice.

168
00:06:58,316 --> 00:07:01,016
There was a special
on these tonight.

169
00:07:01,018 --> 00:07:02,718
Three for one.

170
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,553
Three for one?

171
00:07:04,555 --> 00:07:05,687
Yup.

172
00:07:05,689 --> 00:07:07,792
How can that be profitable
for Frito-Lay?

173
00:07:09,093 --> 00:07:10,996
These corporations,

174
00:07:12,297 --> 00:07:13,428
I don't know
what they're doing.

175
00:07:14,566 --> 00:07:17,766
Well, you two
enjoy each other.

176
00:07:17,768 --> 00:07:22,574
It's often we don't appreciate
what we have until it's gone.

177
00:07:26,677 --> 00:07:28,343
- I think that's it.
- Okay.

178
00:07:28,345 --> 00:07:29,648
Bye-bye!

179
00:07:35,819 --> 00:07:37,954
If Gary sees the others
coming, we're screwed.

180
00:07:37,956 --> 00:07:39,588
No, no, honey,
it's not gonna be a problem.

181
00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:41,824
I was very clear with everyone
to park far away

182
00:07:41,826 --> 00:07:44,060
and just to sneak in quietly,
you know.

183
00:07:44,062 --> 00:07:45,360
But now, I mean,

184
00:07:45,362 --> 00:07:46,629
you don't think
we're being dicks, do you?

185
00:07:46,631 --> 00:07:47,930
Should we just
still invite the guy?

186
00:07:47,932 --> 00:07:49,264
He really seemed
like he wanted to play.

187
00:07:49,266 --> 00:07:51,367
No, no.
Debbie was our friend,

188
00:07:51,369 --> 00:07:52,468
and Gary was just
the creepy husband

189
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:53,737
that we had to put up with.

190
00:07:53,739 --> 00:07:54,870
That's true.

191
00:07:54,872 --> 00:07:56,538
He's only gotten worse
since the divorce.

192
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:59,108
Yeah, we don't owe him
anything, right? Fuck him!

193
00:08:25,737 --> 00:08:26,968
Hi!

194
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:28,473
Hi.

195
00:08:31,609 --> 00:08:33,409
<i>Can we help you?</i>

196
00:08:33,411 --> 00:08:35,110
I'm okay.

197
00:08:35,112 --> 00:08:36,745
Hey!

198
00:08:36,747 --> 00:08:38,080
Of course. Ryan, why are you
coming in through the window?

199
00:08:38,082 --> 00:08:41,450
You said sneak in so RoboCop
wouldn't see us.

200
00:08:41,452 --> 00:08:43,086
I meant sneak in
through the door.

201
00:08:43,088 --> 00:08:44,385
Well, you were super vague.

202
00:08:44,387 --> 00:08:45,788
- I wasn't vague at all.
- Wine?

203
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:47,222
I know I didn't say,
"Break the succulents."

204
00:08:47,224 --> 00:08:48,923
Hey.

205
00:08:48,925 --> 00:08:50,592
I'm not dressed for this nonsense.
This is ridiculous.

206
00:08:50,594 --> 00:08:51,927
It's like <i>Night
of the Living Dead</i> in here.

207
00:08:51,929 --> 00:08:53,596
Yeah, you are asking
a lot from us, Max.

208
00:08:53,598 --> 00:08:54,830
<i>I didn't say to come
through the window.</i>

209
00:08:54,832 --> 00:08:56,533
This is Max.
We used to work together.

210
00:08:56,535 --> 00:08:58,533
His wife, Annie. Michelle,
and that guy's Kevin.

211
00:08:58,535 --> 00:09:00,001
- What's up, buddy?
- The door's right there.

212
00:09:00,003 --> 00:09:01,004
Guys, this is Madison.

213
00:09:01,006 --> 00:09:02,538
Yeah, you brought her
last week.

214
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:04,506
You work at Forever 21, right?

215
00:09:04,508 --> 00:09:06,609
- <i>No, no.</i>
- I work at Sephora.

216
00:09:06,611 --> 00:09:09,144
- I'm confused.
- Different girl.

217
00:09:09,146 --> 00:09:10,879
Same look, same voice.

218
00:09:10,881 --> 00:09:11,947
Nice to meet you.

219
00:09:11,949 --> 00:09:13,651
You, too.

220
00:09:15,719 --> 00:09:17,219
- That's yours.
- It's...

221
00:09:17,221 --> 00:09:19,688
No. I think you're
supposed to kiss it, right?

222
00:09:19,690 --> 00:09:20,722
Welcome.

223
00:09:20,724 --> 00:09:22,158
Do you guys have a bathroom?

224
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,659
There's one just down
the hall. You need it?

225
00:09:23,661 --> 00:09:25,427
Okay, is it on
the right or the left?

226
00:09:25,429 --> 00:09:27,129
I don't wanna go
in the wrong room.

227
00:09:27,131 --> 00:09:28,331
The one with the toilet.

228
00:09:28,333 --> 00:09:29,398
- Can't miss it.
- Okay.

229
00:09:32,303 --> 00:09:33,501
- Oh, boy.
- Dude!

230
00:09:33,503 --> 00:09:34,870
- Oh. Wow.
- Right?

231
00:09:34,872 --> 00:09:36,139
Where'd you find her?
A TED Talk?

232
00:09:36,141 --> 00:09:37,407
No, at Chipotle.

233
00:09:37,409 --> 00:09:38,807
Let me ask you
something, Ryan.

234
00:09:38,809 --> 00:09:40,341
Aren't you sick of losing
game night every week

235
00:09:40,343 --> 00:09:41,543
because of the dates
you bring?

236
00:09:41,545 --> 00:09:43,812
They're not always that bad.

237
00:09:46,483 --> 00:09:48,083
Heather, seriously.

238
00:09:48,085 --> 00:09:49,653
How many photos of you with
the dog filter do you need?

239
00:09:51,554 --> 00:09:53,755
"Dennis" isn't a word.

240
00:09:53,757 --> 00:09:56,158
Yeah, it is.
It's my daddy's name, so...

241
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:59,327
These are the elite,
the very best, the...

242
00:09:59,329 --> 00:10:00,562
Oh, oh. White people!

243
00:10:00,564 --> 00:10:02,297
- What?
- Oh, Jesus.

244
00:10:02,299 --> 00:10:03,666
Okay, unlike you psychos,

245
00:10:03,668 --> 00:10:05,634
I don't give a shit
about winning game night.

246
00:10:05,636 --> 00:10:07,269
I don't need that validation.

247
00:10:07,271 --> 00:10:09,873
But you do need the validation
of dating Instagram models?

248
00:10:09,875 --> 00:10:11,139
Absolutely.

249
00:10:11,141 --> 00:10:13,442
I'm sorry. I'm sorry
I'm not like you, Michelle.

250
00:10:13,444 --> 00:10:14,809
We didn't all meet
our soulmate

251
00:10:14,811 --> 00:10:16,078
when we were 10 years old.

252
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,145
Fourteen.

253
00:10:17,147 --> 00:10:18,414
- Oh, sorry.
- Fourteen.

254
00:10:18,416 --> 00:10:19,916
And we didn't get married
until we were 19.

255
00:10:19,918 --> 00:10:21,450
- See, that's gross.
- You know what, Ryan?

256
00:10:21,452 --> 00:10:24,019
I hope one day you get to meet
a lovely, young lady.

257
00:10:24,021 --> 00:10:26,589
So you can love her as much as I
love my sweet baby right here.

258
00:10:26,591 --> 00:10:28,557
Yes, find her.
Look how cute this...

259
00:10:28,559 --> 00:10:29,825
- Hey, look at this.
- So much love.

260
00:10:29,827 --> 00:10:31,059
Let's look at him
when we do it.

261
00:10:31,061 --> 00:10:32,562
- Hey, everybody.
- <i>Find the love!</i>

262
00:10:32,564 --> 00:10:33,828
Grab your drinks.
Let's go play, come on.

263
00:10:33,830 --> 00:10:35,865
Dude, do you know
what rich people

264
00:10:35,867 --> 00:10:37,432
are doing on their game
nights these days?

265
00:10:37,434 --> 00:10:38,768
What's that?

266
00:10:38,770 --> 00:10:40,269
- Fight clubs.
- What?

267
00:10:40,271 --> 00:10:41,604
I just read about 'em.

268
00:10:41,606 --> 00:10:43,306
They pay poor people
to fight each other,

269
00:10:43,308 --> 00:10:44,841
and then they bet
on the winner.

270
00:10:44,843 --> 00:10:46,708
- No, that's not a real thing.
- Yes, it is!

271
00:10:46,710 --> 00:10:48,344
If you can have anything
you want in this world,

272
00:10:48,346 --> 00:10:50,846
you have to raise the stakes
or life gets boring.

273
00:10:50,848 --> 00:10:52,815
<i>The Kennedys used to have
fight clubs at their compound.</i>

274
00:10:52,817 --> 00:10:54,616
Honey, listen, you gotta
stop reading BuzzFeed

275
00:10:54,618 --> 00:10:56,118
every second of the damn day.

276
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:57,720
How about some Charades?
Should we start with Charades?

277
00:10:57,722 --> 00:10:58,788
- <i>Let's go!</i>
- <i>Yeah!</i>

278
00:10:58,790 --> 00:10:59,989
It's been a while, huh?

279
00:10:59,991 --> 00:11:01,591
Do you wanna wait for Brooks?

280
00:11:01,593 --> 00:11:03,091
I don't think we need to.
No, he's late.

281
00:11:03,093 --> 00:11:04,125
Wait, hold up.

282
00:11:04,127 --> 00:11:05,494
- Brooks is in town?
- <i>Yeah.</i>

283
00:11:05,496 --> 00:11:07,062
I thought he was working
in Europe.

284
00:11:07,064 --> 00:11:09,264
He was, yeah. He's apparently
back for some business.

285
00:11:09,266 --> 00:11:10,399
Haven't seen him yet.

286
00:11:10,401 --> 00:11:12,366
- But we can get started.
- Yeah!

287
00:11:12,368 --> 00:11:13,469
<i>Who wants to start?</i>

288
00:11:13,471 --> 00:11:15,137
Who are you guys
talking about?

289
00:11:15,139 --> 00:11:17,605
Max's brother. He's this super
successful venture capitalist.

290
00:11:17,607 --> 00:11:18,874
Yeah, he was
the first to invest

291
00:11:18,876 --> 00:11:20,176
in Panera Bread, you know?

292
00:11:20,178 --> 00:11:22,077
The Fuji Apple Salad
was his idea.

293
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:23,611
- A lot of investors.
- <i>Yeah.</i>

294
00:11:23,613 --> 00:11:25,581
He's like the Mark Wahlberg
to Max's Donnie.

295
00:11:25,583 --> 00:11:27,350
Well...

296
00:11:27,352 --> 00:11:29,384
Which is a huge compliment
because Donnie was fucking great

297
00:11:29,386 --> 00:11:30,485
in <i>The Sixth Sense,</i> wasn't he?

298
00:11:30,487 --> 00:11:31,653
He was.

299
00:11:31,655 --> 00:11:33,121
Was he in <i>The Sixth Sense?</i>

300
00:11:33,123 --> 00:11:34,255
He sure is, yeah.

301
00:11:34,257 --> 00:11:35,357
You know who is not
in <i>The Sixth Sense?</i>

302
00:11:35,359 --> 00:11:36,692
Mark Wahlberg.

303
00:11:36,694 --> 00:11:39,264
Mark would never take
a role that small.

304
00:11:40,899 --> 00:11:42,932
Is that right, Madison?

305
00:11:42,934 --> 00:11:44,667
Man, I haven't seen him
since the wedding.

306
00:11:44,669 --> 00:11:46,668
- Remember that speech he gave?
- Yes.

307
00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:48,236
And then he paid for that
whole fireworks display!

308
00:11:48,238 --> 00:11:49,806
- Oh, my gosh! The fireworks!
- Little over the top.

309
00:11:49,808 --> 00:11:51,407
Let's get started.
I'm gonna start us off.

310
00:11:51,409 --> 00:11:52,740
Yes, let's start!

311
00:11:52,742 --> 00:11:54,176
We gotta pick teams first.

312
00:11:54,178 --> 00:11:55,778
- <i>Movie?</i>
- <i>It's a movie. Okay.</i>

313
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:57,211
Dude, we have no teams.

314
00:11:57,213 --> 00:11:59,481
- <i>You just give up?</i>
- Better not be Brooks.

315
00:12:13,330 --> 00:12:15,730
You didn't tell him
to park up the street?

316
00:12:15,732 --> 00:12:17,636
I did, yeah,
like, three times.

317
00:12:18,135 --> 00:12:19,538
Hey!

318
00:12:20,338 --> 00:12:22,707
He got a Stingray, huh?

319
00:12:25,809 --> 00:12:27,609
Turn off your car!

320
00:12:27,611 --> 00:12:28,980
What's that?

321
00:12:31,549 --> 00:12:33,316
Hello, again.

322
00:12:33,318 --> 00:12:34,616
Mmm...

323
00:12:34,618 --> 00:12:36,620
Still wearing the uniform.

324
00:12:37,756 --> 00:12:39,187
Hey, bud,
I'm sorry I'm late.

325
00:12:39,189 --> 00:12:41,389
I hope you didn't start
game night without me.

326
00:12:43,327 --> 00:12:44,592
Did you not get my texts?

327
00:12:44,594 --> 00:12:46,495
What text?

328
00:12:46,497 --> 00:12:47,933
Oh, hello, Officer.

329
00:12:49,633 --> 00:12:51,299
Why's that guy staring at us?

330
00:12:51,301 --> 00:12:53,168
Gary, I want you
to meet my brother, Brooks.

331
00:12:53,170 --> 00:12:56,806
We're having a little family
three-man game night tonight.

332
00:12:56,808 --> 00:12:58,273
Wait, what do you mean
three-man?

333
00:12:58,275 --> 00:12:59,841
You said that Michelle
and Ryan and Kevin were...

334
00:12:59,843 --> 00:13:01,476
No, no, no.
Just gonna be us three.

335
00:13:01,478 --> 00:13:02,879
I can see 'em in the doorway.

336
00:13:02,881 --> 00:13:04,846
There's a whole mess
of people. Hey, guys!

337
00:13:04,848 --> 00:13:06,716
- <i>There they are.</i>
- Hey!

338
00:13:06,718 --> 00:13:07,883
These guys are leaving.

339
00:13:07,885 --> 00:13:09,284
Take off, guys.

340
00:13:09,286 --> 00:13:11,322
We had a little bit
of a mix-up with the...

341
00:13:12,357 --> 00:13:13,923
- God damn it!
- What?

342
00:13:13,925 --> 00:13:15,591
We didn't want him to know
we were having a game night.

343
00:13:15,593 --> 00:13:19,128
He used to come, and we don't
like him anymore, so...

344
00:13:19,130 --> 00:13:20,729
Oh.

345
00:13:20,731 --> 00:13:22,230
You know,
I think he knows now.

346
00:13:22,232 --> 00:13:23,566
He sure does.

347
00:13:23,568 --> 00:13:26,969
Maxi Pad,
come on, bring it in.

348
00:13:26,971 --> 00:13:30,505
I haven't
seen you in a year!

349
00:13:30,507 --> 00:13:33,542
Hey, you smell good.

350
00:13:33,544 --> 00:13:34,876
What is that?

351
00:13:34,878 --> 00:13:36,745
Is that Selsun Blue?
Head and Shoulders?

352
00:13:36,747 --> 00:13:38,313
Why do you assume
it's a dandruff shampoo?

353
00:13:38,315 --> 00:13:39,716
Well, I mean,
you've always been

354
00:13:39,718 --> 00:13:41,017
a little bit of a snowstorm.

355
00:13:41,019 --> 00:13:42,051
Hey, would you
hold that for a second?

356
00:13:42,053 --> 00:13:43,686
- Yup.
- Hey, guys!

357
00:13:43,688 --> 00:13:46,389
- You look good, stranger.
- Wanna drink?

358
00:13:46,391 --> 00:13:47,756
It's been forever.

359
00:13:47,758 --> 00:13:49,325
I know, and that's my fault.
I'm so sorry.

360
00:13:49,327 --> 00:13:50,926
Sweet ride, Brooks.

361
00:13:50,928 --> 00:13:52,961
Oh, you like that? I just
got her a couple weeks ago.

362
00:13:52,963 --> 00:13:54,263
What is that? A Corvette?

363
00:13:54,265 --> 00:13:57,466
It's a 1976 rally red
Stingray coupe.

364
00:13:57,468 --> 00:13:58,868
It was my dream car as a kid.

365
00:13:58,870 --> 00:14:00,769
And that's what gave me
the idea to get it.

366
00:14:00,771 --> 00:14:02,873
You know what?
I love your house.

367
00:14:03,708 --> 00:14:04,940
Are you being sarcastic?

368
00:14:04,942 --> 00:14:06,140
No, I mean, I love your house.

369
00:14:06,142 --> 00:14:07,976
It reminds me
of Mom and Dad's.

370
00:14:07,978 --> 00:14:09,979
Makes me think
of simpler times.

371
00:14:09,981 --> 00:14:11,013
Simpler?

372
00:14:11,015 --> 00:14:13,014
So how long
are you in town for?

373
00:14:13,016 --> 00:14:14,082
You know, I'm not sure.

374
00:14:14,084 --> 00:14:15,884
It depends on how many clients

375
00:14:15,886 --> 00:14:17,786
the firm's gonna be having me
schmooze while I'm here.

376
00:14:18,923 --> 00:14:20,121
<i>But hopefully for a while.</i>

377
00:14:20,123 --> 00:14:22,426
I don't get to see you guys,
and I...

378
00:14:24,194 --> 00:14:27,062
God, I really miss you, man.
I really do.

379
00:14:27,064 --> 00:14:28,929
Oh.

380
00:14:28,931 --> 00:14:30,365
Miss you, too, Brooks.

381
00:14:30,367 --> 00:14:32,835
And go!

382
00:14:32,837 --> 00:14:34,570
Shock-rocker.
Dated Rose McGowan.

383
00:14:34,572 --> 00:14:36,205
Oh! Ah, Marilyn Manson.

384
00:14:36,207 --> 00:14:37,272
Yep. You got it.

385
00:14:37,274 --> 00:14:38,975
- Quick story.
- There's no pausing.

386
00:14:38,977 --> 00:14:40,275
You remember
the urban myth where

387
00:14:40,277 --> 00:14:42,110
Marilyn Manson
had the ribs taken out,

388
00:14:42,112 --> 00:14:43,678
so he could go down
on himself?

389
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,113
Yeah.

390
00:14:45,115 --> 00:14:46,115
You don't mind me telling
the story, do you, Max?

391
00:14:46,117 --> 00:14:47,548
You're in the middle of a...

392
00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:49,652
You were 14 years old.
It's an adorable story.

393
00:14:49,654 --> 00:14:50,851
I forbid it.

394
00:14:50,853 --> 00:14:53,322
I'm a little curious.

395
00:14:53,324 --> 00:14:55,191
Did you blow yourself?

396
00:14:55,193 --> 00:14:57,158
You know the bungee cords
on roof racks?

397
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:59,828
- Yeah.
- Max took one of those bungee cords

398
00:14:59,830 --> 00:15:00,895
and he put it around his neck.

399
00:15:00,897 --> 00:15:02,130
Here he goes.

400
00:15:02,132 --> 00:15:03,631
And then he wrapped it
behind his legs,

401
00:15:03,633 --> 00:15:05,833
so he could squish his face
down into his crotch.

402
00:15:05,835 --> 00:15:07,336
<i>But the problem was</i>

403
00:15:07,338 --> 00:15:10,239
that it got stuck!
He couldn't unhook it.

404
00:15:10,241 --> 00:15:13,075
And about an hour later,

405
00:15:13,077 --> 00:15:15,711
Mom comes home,
and she finds him there.

406
00:15:15,713 --> 00:15:17,211
<i>Shit!</i>

407
00:15:17,213 --> 00:15:18,815
Her little pretzel boy
on his bedroom floor naked.

408
00:15:18,817 --> 00:15:21,216
Little pretzel boy?

409
00:15:21,218 --> 00:15:23,519
Great story.
Are we back on now?

410
00:15:23,521 --> 00:15:25,053
So?

411
00:15:25,055 --> 00:15:25,922
So what?

412
00:15:25,924 --> 00:15:27,322
Did you suck it?

413
00:15:27,324 --> 00:15:28,956
Let's go. Come on. Brooks.

414
00:15:28,958 --> 00:15:31,192
Back to it. Come on.
Play the game.

415
00:15:31,194 --> 00:15:33,229
Poor man's Johnny Depp,
starred in <i>Jericho.</i>

416
00:15:33,231 --> 00:15:35,063
Skeet Ulrich.

417
00:15:35,065 --> 00:15:37,666
UN Secretary General,
'92 to '96.

418
00:15:37,668 --> 00:15:39,134
Boutros Boutros-Ghali.

419
00:15:39,136 --> 00:15:41,937
This guy. He hated kids
in <i>Jurassic Park.</i>

420
00:15:41,939 --> 00:15:43,172
Sam Neill.

421
00:15:43,174 --> 00:15:45,039
Dubstep DJ,
looks like Corey Feldman.

422
00:15:45,041 --> 00:15:46,308
- Skrillex.
- Yep.

423
00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:47,442
<i>Rappers love
this Cubist painter.</i>

424
00:15:47,444 --> 00:15:48,443
Picasso!

425
00:15:48,445 --> 00:15:49,845
Big cat shot
by asshole dentist.

426
00:15:49,847 --> 00:15:51,346
- <i>Cecil the lion!</i>
- Time!

427
00:15:51,348 --> 00:15:53,548
- How many?
- <i>Seven!</i>

428
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:56,121
Seven!

429
00:15:57,088 --> 00:15:58,519
You're up, pretzel boy.

430
00:15:58,521 --> 00:15:59,822
Whoo! Go, Max!

431
00:15:59,824 --> 00:16:01,791
- Come on, Max.
- All right. Here we go.

432
00:16:01,793 --> 00:16:03,828
<i>And kick it, go!</i>

433
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:06,895
Oh, this is easy!

434
00:16:06,897 --> 00:16:08,364
Annie, the famous actor
that we met

435
00:16:08,366 --> 00:16:10,068
at the airport
about eight years ago.

436
00:16:11,535 --> 00:16:13,034
Who?

437
00:16:13,036 --> 00:16:14,471
Only actor we've ever met
at an airport who's famous.

438
00:16:15,272 --> 00:16:16,437
Bobby Flay?

439
00:16:16,439 --> 00:16:17,639
Not an actor.

440
00:16:17,641 --> 00:16:19,475
This fellow was in front of us
at the Sbarro.

441
00:16:19,477 --> 00:16:21,876
We were wondering why he wasn't
in the first-class lounge.

442
00:16:21,878 --> 00:16:24,013
Oh, yes, yes.

443
00:16:24,015 --> 00:16:25,313
Who was that?

444
00:16:25,315 --> 00:16:26,715
God damn it!

445
00:16:26,717 --> 00:16:27,850
Max, there's a whole room of
people to help you out here.

446
00:16:27,852 --> 00:16:29,018
- Use us.
- Good point.

447
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:31,287
He was the Incredible Hulk.

448
00:16:31,289 --> 00:16:32,455
Eric Bana.

449
00:16:32,457 --> 00:16:34,190
- Other one.
- <i>Uh, Mark Ruffalo.</i>

450
00:16:34,192 --> 00:16:36,024
- Other one.
- <i>Lou Ferrigno.</i>

451
00:16:36,026 --> 00:16:38,094
Holy shit! <i>Primal Fear.</i>

452
00:16:38,096 --> 00:16:39,894
Richard Gere never played
the Incredible Hulk.

453
00:16:39,896 --> 00:16:42,163
- Time.
- Motherfucking Ed Norton!

454
00:16:42,165 --> 00:16:43,432
Oh!

455
00:16:43,434 --> 00:16:44,600
<i>Primal Fear!</i>

456
00:16:44,602 --> 00:16:45,801
Oh, my God!

457
00:16:45,803 --> 00:16:47,068
<i>He was the Hulk.</i>

458
00:16:47,070 --> 00:16:48,637
- <i>The Hulk.</i>
- <i>I forgot that.</i>

459
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:50,505
Max. Zero points.

460
00:16:50,507 --> 00:16:53,375
I'd say he blew it,
but he won't tell us, will he?

461
00:16:56,078 --> 00:16:57,980
<i>Shit! Did you?</i>

462
00:16:57,982 --> 00:17:00,349
I can't believe
I didn't get Bob Barker.

463
00:17:00,351 --> 00:17:01,616
Hey, guys!

464
00:17:01,618 --> 00:17:03,284
What do you say we do this
at my house next week?

465
00:17:03,286 --> 00:17:04,452
- House? What house?
- Ooh. Really?

466
00:17:04,454 --> 00:17:05,988
Since I don't know
how long

467
00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:07,355
I'm gonna be here,
I rented a place.

468
00:17:07,357 --> 00:17:08,957
It's only a couple miles away.

469
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:10,491
You know,
it's up on Broadmoor.

470
00:17:10,493 --> 00:17:11,861
Ooh! Swanky neighborhood.

471
00:17:11,863 --> 00:17:14,997
It's a very cool house.
But it's just me there alone.

472
00:17:14,999 --> 00:17:17,065
It'd be great
to have you guys come over.

473
00:17:17,067 --> 00:17:19,534
Oh, well,
it's kind of a tradition

474
00:17:19,536 --> 00:17:20,869
to have game nights here.

475
00:17:20,871 --> 00:17:22,238
But you know what?

476
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:24,205
Let's let him show off
his big house, huh?

477
00:17:24,207 --> 00:17:25,840
That's the spirit!

478
00:17:25,842 --> 00:17:28,210
Trust me,

479
00:17:28,212 --> 00:17:32,580
this will be a game night
to remember.

480
00:17:32,582 --> 00:17:33,882
- Oh, boy.
- Mmm.

481
00:17:33,884 --> 00:17:35,683
- Promise?
- Good night, everybody.

482
00:17:35,685 --> 00:17:37,152
I love you much. Drive safely.

483
00:17:37,154 --> 00:17:38,354
- Kisses!
- All right.

484
00:17:38,356 --> 00:17:39,887
- <i>Take it easy.</i>
- <i>Bye.</i>

485
00:17:39,889 --> 00:17:42,593
That little motherfucker.

486
00:17:43,228 --> 00:17:44,124
Whoa!

487
00:17:44,126 --> 00:17:46,361
Well, I mean, come on.

488
00:17:46,363 --> 00:17:48,763
We don't see him
in over a year.

489
00:17:48,765 --> 00:17:51,467
He shows up
in your dream car,

490
00:17:51,469 --> 00:17:52,634
insults our house,

491
00:17:52,636 --> 00:17:54,435
and then tells an embarrassing
story about you,

492
00:17:54,437 --> 00:17:56,805
right before your turn just
to throw you off your game.

493
00:17:56,807 --> 00:17:58,173
Welcome to my whole life.

494
00:17:58,175 --> 00:17:59,607
Why are you suddenly
so worked up about it?

495
00:17:59,609 --> 00:18:01,410
Well, 'cause now he's messing
with your balls

496
00:18:01,412 --> 00:18:03,878
and literally killing
millions of our babies.

497
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:05,448
Well,
that's a little dramatic,

498
00:18:05,450 --> 00:18:07,415
but, yeah, you know.
I mean, that's Brooks.

499
00:18:07,417 --> 00:18:09,652
I thought that this was just
regular old brother stuff,

500
00:18:09,654 --> 00:18:11,319
- but I totally see it now.
- Mmm-mmm.

501
00:18:11,321 --> 00:18:13,521
He undermines you
every chance he gets.

502
00:18:13,523 --> 00:18:14,522
Yeah. Yeah.

503
00:18:14,524 --> 00:18:16,525
- It's crazy!
- Thank you, Annie.

504
00:18:16,527 --> 00:18:18,693
I've never won
a single game against him.

505
00:18:18,695 --> 00:18:22,666
I just... I think we gotta
fix this Brooks thing.

506
00:18:23,867 --> 00:18:25,166
- Fix it?
- Yeah.

507
00:18:25,168 --> 00:18:26,268
What are you suggesting?

508
00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:28,569
I'm suggesting
we beat his ass.

509
00:18:28,571 --> 00:18:30,440
Jesus Christ.

510
00:18:31,876 --> 00:18:33,541
Good evening.

511
00:18:33,543 --> 00:18:35,646
We're gonna skip the cleanup?

512
00:18:41,085 --> 00:18:42,917
Sure you don't wanna
take a Lyft?

513
00:18:42,919 --> 00:18:44,685
No, no. I am not getting
drunk tonight.

514
00:18:44,687 --> 00:18:46,020
- Good evening!
- I'm gonna stay alert and ready.

515
00:18:46,022 --> 00:18:48,123
Jesus, Gary!

516
00:18:48,125 --> 00:18:49,357
Where are you headed?

517
00:18:49,359 --> 00:18:52,794
We are going to, uh,
to my brother's.

518
00:18:52,796 --> 00:18:54,963
Another game night?

519
00:18:54,965 --> 00:18:57,633
No. No, absolutely not.

520
00:18:57,635 --> 00:19:00,035
We're going to, um,

521
00:19:00,037 --> 00:19:02,538
- have some dinner.
- Eat.

522
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:04,138
I see.

523
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:06,040
Pity. I was going
to invite you over

524
00:19:06,042 --> 00:19:08,778
for a dinner I'm hosting.

525
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:11,512
I've purchased
four lamb shanks

526
00:19:11,514 --> 00:19:13,647
that I've been simmering
in a broth

527
00:19:13,649 --> 00:19:16,751
of red wine and rosemary.

528
00:19:16,753 --> 00:19:19,821
- That sounds so yummy, though.
- Damn it.

529
00:19:19,823 --> 00:19:23,357
It was actually
Debbie's recipe.

530
00:19:23,359 --> 00:19:27,095
I like to think she left
behind her recipe cards

531
00:19:27,097 --> 00:19:28,963
as a gesture of goodwill,

532
00:19:28,965 --> 00:19:34,171
but it was most likely
an unintentional oversight.

533
00:19:40,010 --> 00:19:43,114
Well, here we go.

534
00:19:44,147 --> 00:19:45,582
What?

535
00:19:46,716 --> 00:19:48,051
I'm sorry?

536
00:19:48,918 --> 00:19:50,919
I thought you said something.

537
00:19:50,921 --> 00:19:53,355
- No.
- Nope, not us.

538
00:19:53,357 --> 00:19:54,358
Okay.

539
00:19:57,159 --> 00:19:59,062
Have fun.

540
00:20:02,265 --> 00:20:04,866
Oh, fuck me.

541
00:20:04,868 --> 00:20:06,634
A guy who rents a house
this big

542
00:20:06,636 --> 00:20:08,202
must be making up
for something

543
00:20:08,204 --> 00:20:09,838
pretty small, I'd say.

544
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:12,574
No, no. No, I've seen his dick.
It's pretty great.

545
00:20:12,576 --> 00:20:14,412
Well, I tried.

546
00:20:15,913 --> 00:20:17,278
- Hey!
- Hey!

547
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,880
- Hey!
- How are you doing, beautiful?

548
00:20:18,882 --> 00:20:20,883
- Good, good. Really fancy.
- Very nice house, Tony Stark.

549
00:20:20,885 --> 00:20:23,786
Should we give our drink
orders to JARVIS?

550
00:20:23,788 --> 00:20:25,353
No, I got the Tony Stark part,

551
00:20:25,355 --> 00:20:26,688
but then you went
full nerd on me.

552
00:20:26,690 --> 00:20:28,257
I kinda lost you,
but please do come in.

553
00:20:28,259 --> 00:20:29,590
- All right.
- Thanks, Cap.

554
00:20:29,592 --> 00:20:31,292
- Hi, guys!
- <i>What's up?</i>

555
00:20:31,294 --> 00:20:35,029
Boy, could sleep four
on that couch. Look at that.

556
00:20:35,031 --> 00:20:36,733
Oh, hello, friends.

557
00:20:37,799 --> 00:20:40,535
Hey, let me introduce you
to my date. This is Sarah.

558
00:20:40,537 --> 00:20:42,604
Sarah is head of company
accounting at our office.

559
00:20:42,606 --> 00:20:44,138
Well,
corporate communications.

560
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:45,574
And she's also British,

561
00:20:45,576 --> 00:20:47,142
which means
she's smart as shit.

562
00:20:47,144 --> 00:20:48,977
- I'm Irish.
- Okay? Same island.

563
00:20:48,979 --> 00:20:50,412
Well, it's really not.

564
00:20:50,414 --> 00:20:51,311
- Nice to meet you. Hi.
- Nice to meet you, too.

565
00:20:51,313 --> 00:20:52,547
- I'm Max.
- Annie.

566
00:20:52,549 --> 00:20:53,816
So, you can't
always judge a book

567
00:20:53,818 --> 00:20:55,584
by its past covers, can you?

568
00:20:55,586 --> 00:20:57,618
- Mmm.
- Almost a saying.

569
00:20:57,620 --> 00:20:58,953
- Here you go.
- Hey, Brooks.

570
00:20:58,955 --> 00:21:00,221
- Cheers.
- We didn't know

571
00:21:00,223 --> 00:21:01,522
if you had any games,
so we thought

572
00:21:01,524 --> 00:21:03,192
we'd bring you
a few of our favorites.

573
00:21:03,194 --> 00:21:04,893
Hey, look at that.

574
00:21:04,895 --> 00:21:06,627
Whoa!

575
00:21:06,629 --> 00:21:08,196
- Huh.
- <i>The poor games.</i>

576
00:21:08,198 --> 00:21:10,397
I told you
we're taking it up a notch.

577
00:21:10,399 --> 00:21:13,402
The game that we're gonna
play tonight is so epic

578
00:21:13,404 --> 00:21:15,804
that we don't need a board,
and we do not need pieces.

579
00:21:15,806 --> 00:21:17,772
Still didn't need
to throw them across the room.

580
00:21:17,774 --> 00:21:19,107
I was being theatrical.

581
00:21:19,109 --> 00:21:21,076
Holy shit!
Are we doing a fight club?

582
00:21:21,078 --> 00:21:22,711
A what?

583
00:21:22,713 --> 00:21:24,046
It's when rich people pay poor
people to fight each other...

584
00:21:24,048 --> 00:21:25,180
Hey, hey, hey!
Ryan, Ryan, Ryan.

585
00:21:25,182 --> 00:21:26,182
Stop with
the fight club, okay.

586
00:21:26,184 --> 00:21:28,115
- It's nonsense.
- No.

587
00:21:28,117 --> 00:21:29,683
Ryan believes
everything he reads.

588
00:21:29,685 --> 00:21:30,751
Thank you.

589
00:21:30,753 --> 00:21:33,190
So, what are we playing?

590
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:37,926
In the next hour,

591
00:21:37,928 --> 00:21:40,828
someone in this room
is going to be taken,

592
00:21:40,830 --> 00:21:42,497
and it's gonna be up to you
to find them

593
00:21:42,499 --> 00:21:44,132
before they are murdered.

594
00:21:44,134 --> 00:21:46,167
Oh! It's a murder
mystery party.

595
00:21:46,169 --> 00:21:47,702
<i>Not just
any murder mystery.</i>

596
00:21:47,704 --> 00:21:49,871
I found this company.
They do it super real.

597
00:21:49,873 --> 00:21:51,373
They use legit actors.

598
00:21:51,375 --> 00:21:54,143
You're not gonna know
what's real and what's fake.

599
00:21:54,145 --> 00:21:56,010
- Fun!
- <i>But that's not all.</i>

600
00:21:56,012 --> 00:21:58,145
Because whoever
finds the victim

601
00:21:58,147 --> 00:22:00,617
wins the grand prize.

602
00:22:02,319 --> 00:22:04,118
The keys to the Stingray.

603
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:05,953
- What?
- Wow.

604
00:22:05,955 --> 00:22:08,256
Just the keys?

605
00:22:08,258 --> 00:22:09,958
No, Ryan, the whole car.

606
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:11,993
Oh, yes! Oh, man!

607
00:22:11,995 --> 00:22:13,694
You're so lucky I brought you
to this game night

608
00:22:13,696 --> 00:22:16,263
- and not one of Max and Annie's.
- Hey!

609
00:22:16,265 --> 00:22:17,932
No, I just mean
'cause this is better.

610
00:22:17,934 --> 00:22:19,300
Oh.

611
00:22:19,302 --> 00:22:20,602
You're not gonna actually
give away your car?

612
00:22:20,604 --> 00:22:22,737
Oh, it's just a tax write-off.

613
00:22:22,739 --> 00:22:25,574
And the Audi,
it's more practical.

614
00:22:25,576 --> 00:22:27,174
Yeah, that makes sense to me.

615
00:22:27,176 --> 00:22:29,076
Okay. How do we start?

616
00:22:29,078 --> 00:22:31,279
We just wait for it to begin.

617
00:22:31,281 --> 00:22:33,749
Maybe play a drinking game
to pass the time?

618
00:22:33,751 --> 00:22:36,151
This group does not play
drinking games.

619
00:22:36,153 --> 00:22:38,621
Tonight we do, Max.

620
00:22:38,623 --> 00:22:40,521
- Oh. "Never Have I Ever."
- <i>Good one!</i>

621
00:22:40,523 --> 00:22:42,156
Can you believe
this guy?

622
00:22:42,158 --> 00:22:44,226
Yeah,
he's ridiculous.

623
00:22:44,228 --> 00:22:45,859
Beautiful house, though.

624
00:22:45,861 --> 00:22:47,564
Good champagne.

625
00:22:51,402 --> 00:22:53,404
Here we go.

626
00:22:54,471 --> 00:22:57,271
Yup. We're at the house.

627
00:22:57,273 --> 00:22:59,443
We'll let you know
when we have him.

628
00:23:15,291 --> 00:23:17,491
Jesus Christ!

629
00:23:17,493 --> 00:23:19,426
What's with that knife?

630
00:23:19,428 --> 00:23:21,229
It's for the cheese.

631
00:23:21,231 --> 00:23:23,733
Okay, all right.
Just, you know,

632
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:26,167
really aggressive way
to carry a knife.

633
00:23:26,169 --> 00:23:27,836
Oh no, I've got one.

634
00:23:27,838 --> 00:23:31,506
Never have I ever
connected my work computer

635
00:23:31,508 --> 00:23:32,840
to the projector
in the conference room

636
00:23:32,842 --> 00:23:35,442
when it was open
on a WebMD page

637
00:23:35,444 --> 00:23:36,744
<i>for chlamydia symptoms.</i>

638
00:23:36,746 --> 00:23:39,013
- <i>That's not cool!</i>
- <i>Drink!</i>

639
00:23:39,015 --> 00:23:41,115
Just for the record,
I did not have chlamydia.

640
00:23:41,117 --> 00:23:42,351
It was pubic dermatitis.

641
00:23:42,353 --> 00:23:44,086
You get it from
not washing your crotch.

642
00:23:44,088 --> 00:23:45,421
- Okay.
- <i>Good for you.</i>

643
00:23:45,423 --> 00:23:47,789
I... I like her.

644
00:23:47,791 --> 00:23:50,092
Listen, you're not supposed to
single people out in this game.

645
00:23:50,094 --> 00:23:52,294
It's supposed to be
generic things, like,

646
00:23:52,296 --> 00:23:54,162
"Never have I ever slept
with a celebrity."

647
00:23:54,164 --> 00:23:56,263
Oh, I didn't know. Okay.

648
00:23:56,265 --> 00:23:57,432
Whoops.

649
00:23:57,434 --> 00:23:58,733
- Mmm?
- Ooh.

650
00:24:01,672 --> 00:24:02,637
What?

651
00:24:02,639 --> 00:24:04,605
You slept with a celebrity?

652
00:24:04,607 --> 00:24:06,874
No, I was taking a drink
separate from the game.

653
00:24:06,876 --> 00:24:08,644
- That was bad timing.
- <i>Mmm.</i>

654
00:24:08,646 --> 00:24:10,278
<i>I see how you would
think, but it's not.</i>

655
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:11,579
Well, then why
are you breathing

656
00:24:11,581 --> 00:24:13,413
like you just got off
the elliptical?

657
00:24:13,415 --> 00:24:15,284
I'm not. I'm...

658
00:24:15,286 --> 00:24:17,619
Come on, babe.
Whose turn is it?

659
00:24:17,621 --> 00:24:20,454
Uh, it's Max.
Max, it's your turn. Huh?

660
00:24:20,456 --> 00:24:22,324
I'm not playing a drinking
game. Who was it?

661
00:24:22,326 --> 00:24:23,892
What's the deal with that?

662
00:24:23,894 --> 00:24:25,493
They've been
together since middle school.

663
00:24:25,495 --> 00:24:26,327
<i>Uh, it's somebody
else's turn.</i>

664
00:24:26,329 --> 00:24:27,796
- Oh. Oh!
- Yeah!

665
00:24:27,798 --> 00:24:29,265
How could you possibly have
had sex with a celebrity

666
00:24:29,267 --> 00:24:30,932
when we've only had sex
with each other?

667
00:24:30,934 --> 00:24:33,268
Please, can you not make this
one of your things right now?

668
00:24:33,270 --> 00:24:34,903
How is this one of my things?

669
00:24:34,905 --> 00:24:38,173
Yeah, Brooks, this is why
we don't play drinking games.

670
00:24:40,944 --> 00:24:43,010
It looks like
the game is afoot.

671
00:24:43,012 --> 00:24:44,246
Oh!

672
00:24:44,248 --> 00:24:45,780
Thank you, God!

673
00:24:45,782 --> 00:24:47,952
<i>Oh, boy.
Let's buckle up, huh?</i>

674
00:24:50,154 --> 00:24:53,188
- Brooks Davis?
- Yes.

675
00:24:53,190 --> 00:24:54,923
- Oh, shit.
- Ooh!

676
00:24:54,925 --> 00:24:56,460
This is good.

677
00:24:57,094 --> 00:24:58,963
Agent Henderson.

678
00:24:59,796 --> 00:25:00,796
FBI.

679
00:25:00,798 --> 00:25:03,865
Sunglasses at night.
It's legit.

680
00:25:03,867 --> 00:25:04,868
Sit down, please.

681
00:25:06,103 --> 00:25:07,603
I'll get right to the point.

682
00:25:07,605 --> 00:25:10,704
The Bureau has been tracking

683
00:25:10,706 --> 00:25:12,539
a ring
of violent kidnappers

684
00:25:12,541 --> 00:25:15,477
in this very neighborhood.

685
00:25:15,479 --> 00:25:18,949
And we have reason to believe
that one of you

686
00:25:20,183 --> 00:25:21,516
may be their next victim.

687
00:25:23,521 --> 00:25:24,653
<i>That's terrible news.</i>

688
00:25:24,655 --> 00:25:27,955
Contained within
these dossiers

689
00:25:27,957 --> 00:25:31,826
are the clues you will require
to find the kidnappers.

690
00:25:31,828 --> 00:25:34,162
You'd like for us
to do that, yeah?

691
00:25:34,164 --> 00:25:36,531
The Bureau's... What's
the Bureau's role in this?

692
00:25:36,533 --> 00:25:38,499
Maybe you guys could take
my wife in for questioning

693
00:25:38,501 --> 00:25:39,933
because, apparently,
she got a secret life

694
00:25:39,935 --> 00:25:41,269
- I don't know nothing about.
- Baby, this is...

695
00:25:41,271 --> 00:25:42,606
Shut up, all of you!

696
00:25:43,339 --> 00:25:44,574
Wow.

697
00:25:45,408 --> 00:25:47,308
It's not a joke.

698
00:25:47,310 --> 00:25:48,609
You people are in real danger,

699
00:25:48,611 --> 00:25:50,044
and you're
running out of time.

700
00:25:50,046 --> 00:25:53,949
And I, Agent Henderson,
will not stand idly by

701
00:25:53,951 --> 00:25:58,118
while innocent civilians
are slaughtered on my watch.

702
00:25:58,120 --> 00:25:59,453
I told you
this is gonna be great.

703
00:25:59,455 --> 00:26:01,155
- It's so good!
- So good.

704
00:26:01,157 --> 00:26:02,790
But before we get started,

705
00:26:02,792 --> 00:26:04,994
I'm required to ask if any of
you have any food allergies.

706
00:26:05,729 --> 00:26:06,764
Peanuts?

707
00:26:07,496 --> 00:26:08,696
Who the hell are you?

708
00:26:08,698 --> 00:26:10,164
Oh!

709
00:26:10,166 --> 00:26:11,999
Now, wait a second. I know
you're method and all,

710
00:26:12,001 --> 00:26:13,836
but you can't just come in here
and break the door.

711
00:26:13,838 --> 00:26:16,337
I do not mind this game.

712
00:26:16,339 --> 00:26:18,007
Are you crazy?

713
00:26:32,990 --> 00:26:34,825
It's very well done.

714
00:26:36,026 --> 00:26:37,692
No!

715
00:26:37,694 --> 00:26:40,528
That is a strong table.

716
00:26:40,530 --> 00:26:42,196
Oh, watch out!
He's packing heat!

717
00:26:42,198 --> 00:26:43,298
Hell no!

718
00:26:48,637 --> 00:26:50,840
Oh! Oh!

719
00:27:14,297 --> 00:27:15,533
Come on!

720
00:27:28,278 --> 00:27:31,179
You're just making
this harder on yourself!

721
00:27:34,184 --> 00:27:35,983
Oh, shit!

722
00:27:35,985 --> 00:27:38,586
Guys, make sure you get a piece
of this cheese. It's just...

723
00:27:38,588 --> 00:27:39,721
Cut me one.

724
00:27:39,723 --> 00:27:41,122
Try it with the quince.

725
00:27:48,632 --> 00:27:50,597
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

726
00:27:50,599 --> 00:27:51,833
Now he's back.

727
00:27:51,835 --> 00:27:53,134
Stop fighting, asshole!

728
00:27:53,136 --> 00:27:54,236
Help me! This isn't...

729
00:27:54,238 --> 00:27:56,837
The Independent Spirit Award
goes to...

730
00:27:56,839 --> 00:27:59,007
Let's go!

731
00:27:59,009 --> 00:28:00,008
Bye-bye!

732
00:28:00,010 --> 00:28:01,742
First one that follows us
gets shot!

733
00:28:01,744 --> 00:28:03,545
Okay, roger that.
You drive safe.

734
00:28:03,547 --> 00:28:05,613
Come on,
motherfucker!

735
00:28:05,615 --> 00:28:06,949
- Bye.
- That was amazing.

736
00:28:06,951 --> 00:28:07,882
Really good.

737
00:28:07,884 --> 00:28:09,218
- That was really good.
- Wow.

738
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:11,385
Mmm. No, there's something
about this

739
00:28:11,387 --> 00:28:13,989
that just doesn't feel right.

740
00:28:13,991 --> 00:28:16,324
How could you cheat on me
with a celebrity?

741
00:28:16,326 --> 00:28:17,792
I didn't cheat on you.

742
00:28:17,794 --> 00:28:20,428
It was before we got married
when we took that break.

743
00:28:20,430 --> 00:28:22,698
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

744
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:24,132
I've been living
in the matrix.

745
00:28:24,134 --> 00:28:27,236
Agent Henderson, you just
gonna keep lying there?

746
00:28:27,238 --> 00:28:28,368
<i>Is any of this real?</i>

747
00:28:28,370 --> 00:28:30,137
Well, don't kick him!

748
00:28:30,139 --> 00:28:31,071
Stop.

749
00:28:31,073 --> 00:28:32,673
He's a regular
Daniel Day-Lewis.

750
00:28:32,675 --> 00:28:34,575
<i>I thought
we both agreed</i>

751
00:28:34,577 --> 00:28:36,576
<i>that we wouldn't hook up with
anybody else during that break.</i>

752
00:28:36,578 --> 00:28:39,212
Yeah, but then you went and got
a hand job from Karen Waller.

753
00:28:39,214 --> 00:28:41,016
- <i>No, don't do that.</i>
- Boop! Boop! Boop!

754
00:28:41,018 --> 00:28:43,183
Because it was over
the pants, all right?

755
00:28:43,185 --> 00:28:44,618
It was, and it hurt.

756
00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:46,387
It was very dry,
and I didn't climax.

757
00:28:46,389 --> 00:28:48,288
Just admit it,
you guys did more than that.

758
00:28:48,290 --> 00:28:50,491
Don't turn this around on me.
Do not do that.

759
00:28:50,493 --> 00:28:52,026
Don't you Johnnie Cochran me!

760
00:28:52,028 --> 00:28:53,260
Damn it,
they got the jump on us.

761
00:28:53,262 --> 00:28:55,096
- Come on. Come on now!
- Shit, Kev!

762
00:28:55,098 --> 00:28:57,198
All right. Here's the first
clue. Looks like a riddle.

763
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:58,633
"With shiny fangs..."

764
00:28:58,635 --> 00:29:00,201
"...my bloodless bite..."

765
00:29:00,203 --> 00:29:03,438
"...will bring together what's
mostly white."

766
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:05,140
Donald Trump.

767
00:29:05,142 --> 00:29:09,477
"Bloodless bite."
It's not a vampire. Um...

768
00:29:09,479 --> 00:29:10,878
I'll just google it.

769
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:12,313
It's so inconsistent,
isn't it?

770
00:29:12,315 --> 00:29:14,016
I mean, they stage this
super realistic fight.

771
00:29:14,018 --> 00:29:16,951
They give us an FBI dossier
but with riddles.

772
00:29:16,953 --> 00:29:18,853
It's like, let's pick a tone.
Let's stick with it.

773
00:29:18,855 --> 00:29:20,821
But that's the game.
You wanna win this car or not?

774
00:29:20,823 --> 00:29:22,256
Yeah, yeah.
More than anything,

775
00:29:22,258 --> 00:29:23,924
but I feel like Brooks
is setting me up.

776
00:29:23,926 --> 00:29:25,593
Do you get that feeling,
you know?

777
00:29:25,595 --> 00:29:27,528
That this is some game

778
00:29:27,530 --> 00:29:29,198
where somehow
he's gonna humiliate me?

779
00:29:31,201 --> 00:29:33,166
Mmm-hmm.

780
00:29:33,168 --> 00:29:36,104
Well, let's not play
by his rules.

781
00:29:36,106 --> 00:29:38,173
"My bloodless bite,
my bloodless, bloodless bite.

782
00:29:38,175 --> 00:29:40,342
"Bloodless bite, bloodless
bite, bloodless bite."

783
00:29:40,344 --> 00:29:43,444
Can you stop chanting
"bloodless bite"?

784
00:29:43,446 --> 00:29:45,480
- Trying to think.
- Yeah.

785
00:29:45,482 --> 00:29:48,249
Oh, shit!

786
00:29:48,251 --> 00:29:51,118
<i>Max and Annie must have
figured it out.</i>

787
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:53,788
Right. We need to find
an advantage.

788
00:29:53,790 --> 00:29:57,124
Advantage, advantage,
advantage...

789
00:29:57,126 --> 00:29:58,426
Brooks' wallet?

790
00:29:58,428 --> 00:30:00,930
Oh, you think we should steal
all of his shit!

791
00:30:01,364 --> 00:30:02,430
No.

792
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:06,968
Wait.

793
00:30:06,970 --> 00:30:08,935
Hi, yeah.
I lost my credit card.

794
00:30:08,937 --> 00:30:10,971
I was wondering if you could tell me
what the last few charges I made were.

795
00:30:10,973 --> 00:30:12,807
What are you doing?

796
00:30:12,809 --> 00:30:14,875
If we can find out the name of the
murder mystery place he used,

797
00:30:14,877 --> 00:30:16,344
we can go to their office and pay
them off to give us the final clue.

798
00:30:16,346 --> 00:30:17,980
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

799
00:30:17,982 --> 00:30:22,051
You're, like, a double threat.
Brains, and you're British.

800
00:30:23,153 --> 00:30:24,085
Thanks.

801
00:30:24,087 --> 00:30:26,855
Okay. What has shiny fangs

802
00:30:26,857 --> 00:30:29,824
that bites
white things together?

803
00:30:29,826 --> 00:30:30,991
A stapler!

804
00:30:30,993 --> 00:30:33,127
And the white things
are paper.

805
00:30:33,129 --> 00:30:36,664
Yes! You are so smart
and unfaithful!

806
00:30:36,666 --> 00:30:39,002
- Oh, there it is.
- Yes!

807
00:30:39,869 --> 00:30:41,702
Look at that.

808
00:30:41,704 --> 00:30:43,741
- Flash drive.
- Put it in the desktop.

809
00:30:46,076 --> 00:30:47,708
Okay.

810
00:30:47,710 --> 00:30:49,176
Another riddle.

811
00:30:49,178 --> 00:30:52,279
"I'm brown and old by day,
white and young by night.

812
00:30:52,281 --> 00:30:53,247
"My eyes are glass.

813
00:30:53,249 --> 00:30:55,249
"I have nine faces
but no head.

814
00:30:55,251 --> 00:30:57,085
"I sing to the sky
but have no voice.

815
00:30:57,087 --> 00:30:59,956
"I'm everywhere and nowhere."

816
00:31:01,758 --> 00:31:03,458
What the fuck is that?

817
00:31:04,861 --> 00:31:06,192
I mean, how cool
are we? Right?

818
00:31:06,194 --> 00:31:07,729
Very, very cool.
We are very cool.

819
00:31:07,731 --> 00:31:09,230
You're the cool one.

820
00:31:09,232 --> 00:31:11,566
You know, tracking the phone
is just a great idea.

821
00:31:11,568 --> 00:31:13,233
Still on Route 18, huh?

822
00:31:13,235 --> 00:31:15,002
<i>We're catching up to him.
Here we come, Brooksie.</i>

823
00:31:15,004 --> 00:31:16,703
Can you imagine
the look on his face

824
00:31:16,705 --> 00:31:17,972
when we find him so fast?

825
00:31:17,974 --> 00:31:20,040
You know, baby,
I can feel my sperm

826
00:31:20,042 --> 00:31:21,609
already coming back to life.

827
00:31:21,611 --> 00:31:22,810
- Perfect.
- <i>Yeah.</i>

828
00:31:22,812 --> 00:31:24,378
So we'll win
your brother's car,

829
00:31:24,380 --> 00:31:25,980
and then we'll go make
a baby in it.

830
00:31:25,982 --> 00:31:27,382
Yeah! We'll make him watch us.

831
00:31:27,384 --> 00:31:29,017
- Yeah.
- Huh?

832
00:31:29,019 --> 00:31:30,851
- I don't wanna do that.
- No, me neither.

833
00:31:30,853 --> 00:31:32,086
Sorry, don't know
why I said that.

834
00:31:32,088 --> 00:31:33,255
- I'm not into that.
- Not a great idea.

835
00:31:33,257 --> 00:31:34,488
Okay.

836
00:31:34,490 --> 00:31:36,024
Okay, great. Thank you.
All right, I got the name

837
00:31:36,026 --> 00:31:37,124
and the address
of the games company.

838
00:31:37,126 --> 00:31:38,392
- Let's go.
- Yes!

839
00:31:38,394 --> 00:31:39,527
All we have to do now,

840
00:31:39,529 --> 00:31:41,762
figure out what
"bloodless bite" means.

841
00:31:41,764 --> 00:31:44,265
No, we don't. That's why...

842
00:31:44,267 --> 00:31:46,901
- Oh, yeah, no. Yeah, no.
- Doesn't matter. Let's go.

843
00:31:46,903 --> 00:31:48,402
How you gonna
be old and young?

844
00:31:48,404 --> 00:31:50,837
- That doesn't make sense.
- I know.

845
00:31:50,839 --> 00:31:53,307
Guys, hey, how's it goin'?

846
00:31:53,309 --> 00:31:56,611
I just wanted to wish you
the best of luck tonight. Bye.

847
00:31:59,648 --> 00:32:00,882
- No.
- Mmm-mmm.

848
00:32:00,884 --> 00:32:02,416
What are...
What are you doing?

849
00:32:02,418 --> 00:32:04,018
Just being a dick.

850
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:06,220
Oh, come on.

851
00:32:06,222 --> 00:32:08,522
- Don't kick him, Ryan!
- He's such a good actor!

852
00:32:08,524 --> 00:32:09,759
<i>Ryan!</i>

853
00:32:10,694 --> 00:32:12,961
God damn it!

854
00:32:12,963 --> 00:32:14,127
Baby, hand me those matches.

855
00:32:14,129 --> 00:32:15,563
I'm about to burn
this door down.

856
00:32:15,565 --> 00:32:16,932
You're gonna light a fire

857
00:32:16,934 --> 00:32:18,200
in a windowless room
that we're trapped in?

858
00:32:18,202 --> 00:32:19,733
You slept with Bill Nye
the Science Guy.

859
00:32:19,735 --> 00:32:20,801
He talked to you about flames?

860
00:32:20,803 --> 00:32:22,071
What about that?

861
00:32:36,552 --> 00:32:38,719
Where could he be?

862
00:32:38,721 --> 00:32:40,755
His phone stopped
right here, huh?

863
00:32:43,592 --> 00:32:44,994
- Hear that?
- Yeah.

864
00:32:46,628 --> 00:32:47,828
Ugh.

865
00:32:47,830 --> 00:32:49,163
Found it!

866
00:32:49,165 --> 00:32:50,698
He must have known
we were tracking him.

867
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:52,336
Well, they outsmarted us.

868
00:32:54,537 --> 00:32:56,270
Hang on.

869
00:32:57,273 --> 00:32:59,140
Isn't that one of the actors?

870
00:32:59,142 --> 00:33:01,709
<i>Guess they're not
so smart after all, huh?</i>

871
00:33:01,711 --> 00:33:05,480
Guess not.
We are nailing this!

872
00:33:05,482 --> 00:33:07,080
Why are we crouching?

873
00:33:07,082 --> 00:33:09,152
I don't know. It feels right.

874
00:33:12,789 --> 00:33:14,387
Oh, it's horrible in here.

875
00:33:14,389 --> 00:33:17,558
Yeah, it's sticky.
Shoes are shot.

876
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:18,893
Ooh. There he is, there he is.

877
00:33:18,895 --> 00:33:19,961
Don't let him see you.
Come on.

878
00:33:19,963 --> 00:33:21,261
Sit down right here.

879
00:33:21,263 --> 00:33:23,632
Bartender, sir,
can I ask you a question?

880
00:33:23,634 --> 00:33:24,965
Um...

881
00:33:24,967 --> 00:33:26,400
You, um...

882
00:33:26,402 --> 00:33:28,737
You didn't happen to see
a fellow brought in here,

883
00:33:28,739 --> 00:33:30,005
looks a little bit like me,

884
00:33:30,007 --> 00:33:32,440
but he's got a little bit
of a sharper chin

885
00:33:32,442 --> 00:33:33,973
and higher cheekbones?

886
00:33:33,975 --> 00:33:35,910
So, a better-looking guy?

887
00:33:35,912 --> 00:33:37,978
No, well,
I wouldn't call it that.

888
00:33:37,980 --> 00:33:39,583
I didn't see nothing.

889
00:33:40,983 --> 00:33:42,616
- Oh, boy. You hear that?
- Huh. Yeah.

890
00:33:42,618 --> 00:33:44,484
That double negative?
"Didn't see nothing"?

891
00:33:44,486 --> 00:33:45,886
- It's a little forced, right?
- Yeah, I think he's in on it.

892
00:33:45,888 --> 00:33:47,154
- 'Course he is.
- Look at those tats.

893
00:33:47,156 --> 00:33:49,624
So fresh, probably fake.

894
00:33:49,626 --> 00:33:51,992
Tell you what.
Let's give him a test, okay?

895
00:33:51,994 --> 00:33:53,426
Let's order a couple of drinks

896
00:33:53,428 --> 00:33:54,929
that only a real bartender
would know how to make.

897
00:33:54,931 --> 00:33:56,130
- Right?
- Oh! Smart! Yes.

898
00:33:56,132 --> 00:33:57,464
- Sir! Excuse me. Hi.
- Barkeep.

899
00:33:57,466 --> 00:33:59,032
Totally forgot
to order drinks.

900
00:33:59,034 --> 00:34:01,035
Yes, uh...

901
00:34:01,037 --> 00:34:04,074
Could I please have
a vodka tonic?

902
00:34:05,607 --> 00:34:06,840
Well done, honey.

903
00:34:06,842 --> 00:34:09,142
I'm gonna have
a Harvey Wallbanger.

904
00:34:09,144 --> 00:34:11,879
Okay? Appreciate it.

905
00:34:11,881 --> 00:34:13,381
Jesus! Did you see that look?

906
00:34:13,383 --> 00:34:14,682
Guy doesn't know
what's going on.

907
00:34:14,684 --> 00:34:15,850
Think you stumped him.

908
00:34:15,852 --> 00:34:17,584
Some regional theater hack.

909
00:34:17,586 --> 00:34:19,486
Huh?

910
00:34:19,488 --> 00:34:22,288
- Well, this is kind of fun, isn't it?
- Yeah.

911
00:34:22,290 --> 00:34:24,292
It's nice
to get out of the house.

912
00:34:24,294 --> 00:34:26,560
You know, we're not gonna be able to
do stuff like this if we have kids.

913
00:34:26,562 --> 00:34:27,528
- What?
- Yeah.

914
00:34:27,530 --> 00:34:29,129
- Why not?
- Well, I don't know.

915
00:34:29,131 --> 00:34:30,631
I was thinking about it.
Remember Dan and Linda?

916
00:34:30,633 --> 00:34:32,433
Remember how much time
we used to spend with them?

917
00:34:32,435 --> 00:34:35,336
Just tons of fun, and then
they had those twins.

918
00:34:35,338 --> 00:34:37,104
Boom! Off the grid, right?

919
00:34:37,106 --> 00:34:38,538
Last time we saw them

920
00:34:38,540 --> 00:34:40,375
was their Christmas card
with the wonky kids on it.

921
00:34:40,377 --> 00:34:43,711
Yeah, I love those Christmas cards.
They look so happy.

922
00:34:43,713 --> 00:34:45,013
But you know what I mean.

923
00:34:45,015 --> 00:34:46,650
- We don't see 'em.
- Vodka tonic.

924
00:34:47,751 --> 00:34:49,283
Harvey Wallbanger.

925
00:34:49,285 --> 00:34:50,651
- Appreciate it.
- Thank you.

926
00:34:50,653 --> 00:34:52,222
Cheers.

927
00:34:55,057 --> 00:34:56,557
- Did he get it right?
- Huh.

928
00:34:56,559 --> 00:34:58,493
I do not know. I realized I've
never had one of these,

929
00:34:58,495 --> 00:35:01,029
but that is a tasty drink.
It's kind of tart.

930
00:35:01,031 --> 00:35:02,830
<i>You wanna try it?
Oh! Honey!</i>

931
00:35:02,832 --> 00:35:04,232
Honey! There's Brooks!

932
00:35:04,234 --> 00:35:05,767
Brooks is here.
Brooks is here.

933
00:35:05,769 --> 00:35:07,167
We're about to win this thing!

934
00:35:07,169 --> 00:35:09,236
- Yes, yes!
- Look who came in here.

935
00:35:09,238 --> 00:35:11,439
Oh! No! I think he made us.

936
00:35:11,441 --> 00:35:13,741
So what? It's over. What, are
they gonna try to stop us?

937
00:35:13,743 --> 00:35:15,176
- Let's go.
- Yeah, probably.

938
00:35:15,178 --> 00:35:18,011
But that's why I brought this.

939
00:35:18,013 --> 00:35:19,647
Jesus Christ, honey!
Where did you get a gun?

940
00:35:19,649 --> 00:35:22,250
No, no, that's the fake gun
from Brooks' fight.

941
00:35:22,252 --> 00:35:23,651
Oh, yeah.
Boy, that looks real.

942
00:35:23,653 --> 00:35:25,053
- Yeah, well, you know...
- Look at that.

943
00:35:25,055 --> 00:35:26,520
Brooks never spares
any expense.

944
00:35:26,522 --> 00:35:28,555
- Yeah, that's true.
- Okay. Follow my lead, huh?

945
00:35:28,557 --> 00:35:30,323
- Why, what are you doing?
- Lead?

946
00:35:30,325 --> 00:35:33,194
Any of you
fucking pricks move,

947
00:35:33,196 --> 00:35:37,131
and I'll execute every
motherfucking last one of you!

948
00:35:37,133 --> 00:35:38,533
Very nice, honey.

949
00:35:38,535 --> 00:35:40,500
<i>Pulp Fiction</i>, anybody?
Right? It's a classic.

950
00:35:40,502 --> 00:35:41,535
We love films.

951
00:35:41,537 --> 00:35:43,203
Okay, what the fuck
is this shit?

952
00:35:43,205 --> 00:35:44,471
Well, you're gonna
hand over the keys

953
00:35:44,473 --> 00:35:46,006
'cause we're gonna take
my brother.

954
00:35:46,008 --> 00:35:47,941
- Bullshit.
- Oh, you know what's bullshit

955
00:35:47,943 --> 00:35:49,778
is your bald, ugly face.

956
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:51,111
Uh-uh. No, that's personal.

957
00:35:51,113 --> 00:35:52,846
Come on, honey,
let's just keep it fun.

958
00:35:52,848 --> 00:35:54,582
All right, I'm sorry I called
you bald, you little bitch!

959
00:35:54,584 --> 00:35:56,250
Well, that's,
again, you know...

960
00:35:56,252 --> 00:35:57,519
- Let the gun do the talking.
- Okay.

961
00:35:57,521 --> 00:35:58,886
- Come on.
- Ah!

962
00:35:58,888 --> 00:36:01,154
On your knees. Hands in
the air. Heads on the ground.

963
00:36:01,156 --> 00:36:02,357
- Good. Good. Great.
- Eyes closed.

964
00:36:02,359 --> 00:36:03,658
That's it.
Get 'em up, reach for it.

965
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:05,359
- Hands up! That's right.
- There we go.

966
00:36:05,361 --> 00:36:07,361
- All right, hands in the air!
- Get 'em up!

967
00:36:07,363 --> 00:36:09,029
- Yep.
- Yo, where's my head go?

968
00:36:09,031 --> 00:36:10,497
- Down.
- On the floor.

969
00:36:10,499 --> 00:36:11,698
Just rest it.

970
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:13,334
How am I supposed
to put my hands in the air

971
00:36:13,336 --> 00:36:14,368
- with my head on the ground?
- Fucking exactly.

972
00:36:14,370 --> 00:36:16,069
I did have the same question.

973
00:36:17,473 --> 00:36:20,040
Child's pose?
Do you guys know child's pose?

974
00:36:20,042 --> 00:36:21,174
Fuck is a child's pose, man?

975
00:36:21,176 --> 00:36:22,308
<i>You've never done yoga?</i>

976
00:36:22,310 --> 00:36:24,812
- Okay, wow.
- No?

977
00:36:24,814 --> 00:36:26,147
- Cover me.
- Show 'em, baby.

978
00:36:26,149 --> 00:36:27,647
- <i>All right. Arms out.</i>
- Here she comes.

979
00:36:27,649 --> 00:36:29,616
Knees apart if you have
back problems.

980
00:36:29,618 --> 00:36:31,486
And if you're
doing it right,

981
00:36:31,488 --> 00:36:33,787
you're really gonna feel that
lumbar opening up back there.

982
00:36:33,789 --> 00:36:35,423
<i>Let's put your head down.</i>

983
00:36:35,425 --> 00:36:38,125
Come on. I don't wanna have
to use this. Okay?

984
00:36:38,127 --> 00:36:40,227
Okay.

985
00:36:40,229 --> 00:36:41,495
Can't you just tell me
who it was?

986
00:36:41,497 --> 00:36:43,229
I know you, Kev.
If I tell you,

987
00:36:43,231 --> 00:36:44,933
you'll just obsess
about it even more.

988
00:36:44,935 --> 00:36:46,401
Okay, fine. How about this?

989
00:36:46,403 --> 00:36:48,602
If I guess it right,
you tell me.

990
00:36:48,604 --> 00:36:49,671
Fine.

991
00:36:49,673 --> 00:36:50,738
Was it an actor?

992
00:36:50,740 --> 00:36:52,105
Yes. That tower is unstable.

993
00:36:52,107 --> 00:36:54,475
I'm not stable!
Was he over 40?

994
00:36:54,477 --> 00:36:55,743
Yes. Be careful.

995
00:36:55,745 --> 00:36:57,845
Okay. American?

996
00:36:57,847 --> 00:36:59,115
Yes.

997
00:37:01,017 --> 00:37:03,149
It's Tommy Lee Jones.

998
00:37:03,151 --> 00:37:04,687
What? Ew. No.

999
00:37:06,254 --> 00:37:09,055
Denzel? Was it Denzel?
Denzel Washington?

1000
00:37:09,057 --> 00:37:11,158
It wasn't, unfortunately.

1001
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:13,060
Thank God.

1002
00:37:13,062 --> 00:37:14,895
Um... Be careful.

1003
00:37:14,897 --> 00:37:17,298
Oh! Sweet freedom.

1004
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:18,966
Oh, my...

1005
00:37:18,968 --> 00:37:21,201
You see, this dumbass thought
he can keep us locked in here.

1006
00:37:21,203 --> 00:37:24,238
But guess what?
You can't lock us in here!

1007
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:26,540
You see, hate put us in here!

1008
00:37:26,542 --> 00:37:27,408
Okay, baby.

1009
00:37:27,410 --> 00:37:28,942
But love is gonna bust us out!

1010
00:37:28,944 --> 00:37:30,479
Oh, my God!

1011
00:37:32,716 --> 00:37:33,881
Oh, my God!

1012
00:37:33,883 --> 00:37:35,350
Kev... Kev, are you okay?

1013
00:37:35,352 --> 00:37:37,220
Baby, I fell down.

1014
00:37:45,562 --> 00:37:47,395
There it is.

1015
00:37:47,397 --> 00:37:51,131
Yes, I'm so glad
I invited you tonight!

1016
00:37:51,133 --> 00:37:52,600
Yeah, me too.

1017
00:37:52,602 --> 00:37:54,267
I usually bring these girls
I wanna sleep with,

1018
00:37:54,269 --> 00:37:55,636
and they just suck!

1019
00:37:55,638 --> 00:37:58,272
You're like
a breath of fresh air.

1020
00:37:58,274 --> 00:38:00,006
Aw, thanks.

1021
00:38:00,008 --> 00:38:01,174
I usually go out with men

1022
00:38:01,176 --> 00:38:02,377
I find interesting
and non-stupid,

1023
00:38:02,379 --> 00:38:03,877
so this is a bit new
for me, too.

1024
00:38:03,879 --> 00:38:05,082
Whoa!

1025
00:38:05,682 --> 00:38:06,546
Are we cool?

1026
00:38:06,548 --> 00:38:08,482
Did I say something wrong?

1027
00:38:08,484 --> 00:38:09,917
No.

1028
00:38:09,919 --> 00:38:12,319
No, I mean I was wondering why
you asked me along tonight,

1029
00:38:12,321 --> 00:38:14,689
and now I know you
just needed a ringer, so...

1030
00:38:14,691 --> 00:38:15,823
Oh, did you...

1031
00:38:15,825 --> 00:38:17,558
You thought this was a date?
I didn't...

1032
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:21,462
No, actually.
Well, I was hoping it wasn't.

1033
00:38:21,464 --> 00:38:23,230
Then why are you
wearing lipstick?

1034
00:38:23,232 --> 00:38:24,732
- I'm not.
- Yeah, you are.

1035
00:38:24,734 --> 00:38:26,066
What are you...

1036
00:38:26,068 --> 00:38:27,600
You can't touch
a girl's mouth.

1037
00:38:27,602 --> 00:38:29,270
Why? Are you scared I'm
gonna smear your lipstick...

1038
00:38:29,272 --> 00:38:31,138
Oh, my God! You bit me!

1039
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:32,238
Yeah, and I'll bite you again.

1040
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:33,341
There's lipstick on here.

1041
00:38:33,343 --> 00:38:34,941
Oh, shut up!

1042
00:38:34,943 --> 00:38:37,078
I see you wiping off
that date lipstick!

1043
00:38:39,149 --> 00:38:40,214
Ow!

1044
00:38:40,216 --> 00:38:42,452
That really hurt a little bit.

1045
00:38:43,653 --> 00:38:45,118
Hello?

1046
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:47,187
Hello?

1047
00:38:54,030 --> 00:38:55,432
Um, excuse me?

1048
00:39:00,368 --> 00:39:02,171
Yeah, okay.

1049
00:39:02,738 --> 00:39:03,805
Um...

1050
00:39:03,807 --> 00:39:04,808
Hello?

1051
00:39:08,510 --> 00:39:10,746
Oh, oh! Oh, shit!

1052
00:39:13,381 --> 00:39:14,650
Holy shit!

1053
00:39:15,385 --> 00:39:16,817
My God!

1054
00:39:16,819 --> 00:39:18,551
Come on! Bloody hell!

1055
00:39:18,553 --> 00:39:20,087
- What?
- Phew!

1056
00:39:20,089 --> 00:39:23,390
You guys scared me so bad.
What are you doing?

1057
00:39:23,392 --> 00:39:24,959
What the fuck is that?

1058
00:39:24,961 --> 00:39:28,062
Oh. Well, I just came from
a six-hour murder mystery

1059
00:39:28,064 --> 00:39:29,662
where I played the corpse.

1060
00:39:29,664 --> 00:39:31,665
I must have dozed off before
I had a chance to clean up.

1061
00:39:31,667 --> 00:39:34,134
Well, you scared
the shit out of us.

1062
00:39:34,136 --> 00:39:35,602
Really? Thank you.

1063
00:39:35,604 --> 00:39:37,337
Actually that means a lot
'cause I do my own makeup.

1064
00:39:37,339 --> 00:39:39,774
What kind of party
has a pregnant corpse?

1065
00:39:39,776 --> 00:39:42,042
No, I'm actually pregnant,
this isn't part of it.

1066
00:39:42,044 --> 00:39:43,111
This is just...

1067
00:39:43,113 --> 00:39:44,278
Oh!

1068
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:45,312
- Congrats.
- <i>Thank you!</i>

1069
00:39:46,716 --> 00:39:48,982
Um, we want you
to give us the final clue

1070
00:39:48,984 --> 00:39:52,419
to the murder mystery
Brooks Davis ordered.

1071
00:39:52,421 --> 00:39:54,488
Oh, my gosh.
But that would ruin the fun.

1072
00:39:54,490 --> 00:39:57,524
We don't want the fun.
We just wanna win.

1073
00:39:57,526 --> 00:39:59,660
Yeah, I can't do that.

1074
00:40:10,439 --> 00:40:12,676
This change your mind?

1075
00:40:17,647 --> 00:40:18,782
No.

1076
00:40:20,115 --> 00:40:21,816
Don't...

1077
00:40:21,818 --> 00:40:23,953
What about this?

1078
00:40:32,127 --> 00:40:33,330
Mmm.

1079
00:40:34,464 --> 00:40:35,995
You drive a hard bargain.
Okay.

1080
00:40:35,997 --> 00:40:38,467
Let's take it up a notch.

1081
00:40:51,481 --> 00:40:53,881
I was hoping I wasn't
gonna have to dig this deep,

1082
00:40:53,883 --> 00:40:55,716
but okay.

1083
00:40:55,718 --> 00:40:57,787
Final offer.

1084
00:41:04,227 --> 00:41:05,658
You know what?
It doesn't matter

1085
00:41:05,660 --> 00:41:07,962
how slowly you slide it over!

1086
00:41:07,964 --> 00:41:10,564
Okay? It's $17!
How much do you want?

1087
00:41:10,566 --> 00:41:12,366
Um, I don't know.
Probably 100.

1088
00:41:12,368 --> 00:41:13,500
Give her 100.

1089
00:41:13,502 --> 00:41:15,305
I don't have 100.

1090
00:41:16,138 --> 00:41:18,308
How much have you got?

1091
00:41:18,975 --> 00:41:22,575
- $17.
- $17?

1092
00:41:22,577 --> 00:41:24,546
You brought $17 out?

1093
00:41:27,082 --> 00:41:29,116
Nice!

1094
00:41:29,118 --> 00:41:30,417
- Thank you!
- Cool.

1095
00:41:30,419 --> 00:41:32,953
Oh! So you're just
gonna keep it. I gotcha.

1096
00:41:32,955 --> 00:41:34,955
Stay back!

1097
00:41:34,957 --> 00:41:36,323
Hey, buddy,
can you just give us

1098
00:41:36,325 --> 00:41:37,424
the answer
to the second riddle

1099
00:41:37,426 --> 00:41:38,526
'cause we're way behind.

1100
00:41:38,528 --> 00:41:39,794
Don't you get it?

1101
00:41:39,796 --> 00:41:41,462
That was not
supposed to happen.

1102
00:41:43,231 --> 00:41:45,933
Oh, what now? You guys already
did the breaking-in thing.

1103
00:41:45,935 --> 00:41:48,435
Shut up! And get on the floor,
all of you!

1104
00:41:48,437 --> 00:41:51,939
Whoa! Ron, you okay?

1105
00:41:51,941 --> 00:41:53,906
No, Nathan, I'm not okay.

1106
00:41:53,908 --> 00:41:56,544
Two guys came in here
and attacked me.

1107
00:41:56,546 --> 00:41:58,379
- Oh, my God.
- I know!

1108
00:41:58,381 --> 00:42:01,082
And I quit Disney Cruises
for this bullshit.

1109
00:42:01,084 --> 00:42:03,250
"Look in your jacket pocket."

1110
00:42:03,252 --> 00:42:05,252
We can check, but that
doesn't make any sense.

1111
00:42:05,254 --> 00:42:06,553
I'm not wearing a jacket.

1112
00:42:06,555 --> 00:42:09,223
Maybe it means a,
like a book jacket.

1113
00:42:09,225 --> 00:42:11,591
Why would a book
have a jacket?

1114
00:42:13,796 --> 00:42:14,928
Murder We Wrote.

1115
00:42:14,930 --> 00:42:16,729
Glenda, something terrible
has happened.

1116
00:42:16,731 --> 00:42:18,564
- What?
- <i>Nathan and I showed up for the take away,</i>

1117
00:42:18,566 --> 00:42:20,468
and Ron had been attacked.

1118
00:42:20,470 --> 00:42:23,069
- Where? At the Brooks Davis house?
- <i>Yes.</i>

1119
00:42:23,071 --> 00:42:24,340
- Huh?
- What?

1120
00:42:25,207 --> 00:42:26,741
Is everyone okay?

1121
00:42:26,743 --> 00:42:28,642
<i>No, no.
I'm not okay, Glenda!</i>

1122
00:42:28,644 --> 00:42:32,245
I have a throbbing headache,
and they took the host!

1123
00:42:32,247 --> 00:42:33,913
- Who took him?
- <i>Kidnappers!</i>

1124
00:42:33,915 --> 00:42:36,819
Real ones!
Dangerous fucking criminals!

1125
00:42:47,196 --> 00:42:48,629
<i>♪ I'm packed and I'm holding</i>

1126
00:42:48,631 --> 00:42:50,263
<i>♪ I'm smiling, she's living,
she's golden</i>

1127
00:42:50,265 --> 00:42:51,497
<i>♪ She lives for me</i>

1128
00:42:51,499 --> 00:42:53,000
- Sing it to the mic.
- Jesus!

1129
00:42:53,002 --> 00:42:54,100
No.

1130
00:42:54,102 --> 00:42:55,470
<i>♪ Her own motivation</i>

1131
00:42:55,472 --> 00:42:57,904
<i>♪ She goes round,
and she goes down on me</i>

1132
00:42:57,906 --> 00:42:58,872
And you, Tats?

1133
00:42:58,874 --> 00:43:02,008
You got something to say?
No? Boop.

1134
00:43:02,010 --> 00:43:03,176
<i>♪ Coming over you</i>

1135
00:43:03,178 --> 00:43:04,877
<i>♪ Keep on smiling,
what we go through</i>

1136
00:43:04,879 --> 00:43:07,180
<i>♪ One stop to the rhythm
that divides you ♪</i>

1137
00:43:07,182 --> 00:43:10,517
I see you eyeing that,
Ponytail. Not on my watch!

1138
00:43:10,519 --> 00:43:12,586
Bingo! Bingo! I got 'em, baby.
Let's do this.

1139
00:43:12,588 --> 00:43:15,057
Yes! Okay.

1140
00:43:16,559 --> 00:43:17,959
Hey, hey, Brooks!

1141
00:43:17,961 --> 00:43:20,394
- Guess who it is!
- Oh!

1142
00:43:20,396 --> 00:43:23,397
Ready? Hello!

1143
00:43:23,399 --> 00:43:25,232
- Look at that face!
- Oh, shit.

1144
00:43:25,234 --> 00:43:27,533
- You did not expect us this early, did ya?
- That is priceless!

1145
00:43:27,535 --> 00:43:28,736
I've gotta capture
this moment.

1146
00:43:28,738 --> 00:43:30,004
Honey, get in there.

1147
00:43:30,006 --> 00:43:31,872
We'll take a quick
little selfie here

1148
00:43:31,874 --> 00:43:34,841
and send it off to the losers.
One, two, three.

1149
00:43:34,843 --> 00:43:35,910
Cheese!

1150
00:43:35,912 --> 00:43:37,044
Ha!

1151
00:43:37,046 --> 00:43:38,712
Perfect.
Oh, speak of the devil.

1152
00:43:38,714 --> 00:43:40,480
There's Ryan now, probably
calling begging for help.

1153
00:43:40,482 --> 00:43:41,647
- Ugh!
- Ignore.

1154
00:43:41,649 --> 00:43:43,750
This is not a game, Max!

1155
00:43:43,752 --> 00:43:47,020
Jesus! Guys,
it's a wrap in here, okay?

1156
00:43:47,022 --> 00:43:48,321
<i>Show's over!</i>

1157
00:43:48,323 --> 00:43:50,189
Listen, I'm not a venture
capitalist. I'm a smuggler!

1158
00:43:50,191 --> 00:43:51,459
A smuggler?

1159
00:43:51,461 --> 00:43:52,892
<i>Yeah,
I made a mistake.</i>

1160
00:43:52,894 --> 00:43:54,495
I sold The Bulgarian's egg
to a different guy.

1161
00:43:54,497 --> 00:43:56,196
And I have to get it back
to him, or he's gonna kill me!

1162
00:43:56,198 --> 00:43:57,598
"The Bulgarian's egg"?

1163
00:43:57,600 --> 00:43:59,098
Wasn't that the third
<i>Harry Potter</i> book?

1164
00:43:59,100 --> 00:44:00,267
Wait, I'm confused.

1165
00:44:00,269 --> 00:44:01,567
So this isn't the end
of this whole thing?

1166
00:44:01,569 --> 00:44:02,970
No, it is the end, okay?

1167
00:44:02,972 --> 00:44:04,770
You said, whoever catches you
gets the car.

1168
00:44:04,772 --> 00:44:07,040
We found you, we get the car.
Game over.

1169
00:44:07,042 --> 00:44:09,276
No! I'm telling you!
This is all real!

1170
00:44:09,278 --> 00:44:10,977
<i>The shitty actors
are real? Come on.</i>

1171
00:44:10,979 --> 00:44:13,279
How about that ridiculous
fight? Was that real?

1172
00:44:13,281 --> 00:44:14,580
Is this gun real?

1173
00:44:14,582 --> 00:44:15,716
Oh, no, Annie!

1174
00:44:15,718 --> 00:44:18,151
Oh, no. Oh, no.
Bang, bang.

1175
00:44:20,122 --> 00:44:21,124
Ow!

1176
00:44:29,865 --> 00:44:30,763
Blood!

1177
00:44:30,765 --> 00:44:33,566
Oh, my God! I shot you!

1178
00:44:33,568 --> 00:44:35,002
You fucking shot me!

1179
00:44:35,004 --> 00:44:37,104
Cut me loose
before we all get shot!

1180
00:44:37,106 --> 00:44:38,037
Come on, untie me!

1181
00:44:38,039 --> 00:44:39,372
- <i>Get me out of here!</i>
- Oh, God!

1182
00:44:41,109 --> 00:44:42,475
Help me. Help!

1183
00:44:42,477 --> 00:44:43,743
Oh, my God!

1184
00:44:43,745 --> 00:44:44,877
Go out! Go, go, go!

1185
00:44:44,879 --> 00:44:46,312
What the fuck
did you do to me?

1186
00:44:46,314 --> 00:44:48,415
- Come on, come on, come on.
- God damn it!

1187
00:44:48,417 --> 00:44:49,750
- Hey!
- Where are the guns?

1188
00:44:49,752 --> 00:44:51,087
- Here, here!
- Go!

1189
00:44:52,455 --> 00:44:53,587
You shot me.

1190
00:44:53,589 --> 00:44:55,154
I know, I feel terrible.

1191
00:44:55,156 --> 00:44:56,589
- Come on, man!
- Go! Go, go!

1192
00:44:56,591 --> 00:44:57,658
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1193
00:44:57,660 --> 00:44:59,091
<i>Come on, bitch!</i>

1194
00:44:59,093 --> 00:45:00,660
- Oh, my God!
- Move your ass!

1195
00:45:00,662 --> 00:45:02,328
- Honey, get in!
- Go, go!

1196
00:45:02,330 --> 00:45:03,732
<i>Go, go, go!</i>

1197
00:45:04,732 --> 00:45:06,568
Holy shit!

1198
00:45:07,569 --> 00:45:10,872
Hold up!
Hold up, motherfucker!

1199
00:45:11,807 --> 00:45:14,042
- God damn it!
- Man, come on!

1200
00:45:15,611 --> 00:45:18,044
Brooks, what the fuck is going
on with you? Start talking!

1201
00:45:18,046 --> 00:45:20,546
I've lied to you and
the family about what I do.

1202
00:45:20,548 --> 00:45:22,582
I buy and I sell illegal shit

1203
00:45:22,584 --> 00:45:23,750
for people
on the black market.

1204
00:45:23,752 --> 00:45:24,984
Really?
So you're a criminal?

1205
00:45:24,986 --> 00:45:26,222
Oh, my God!
They're following us!

1206
00:45:27,856 --> 00:45:29,490
But I made a mistake
because there's this guy,

1207
00:45:29,492 --> 00:45:31,091
they call him The Bulgarian.

1208
00:45:31,093 --> 00:45:32,926
He's got his fingers in all
these pies around the world.

1209
00:45:32,928 --> 00:45:34,928
- What kind of pies?
- Illegal pies, Max.

1210
00:45:34,930 --> 00:45:36,662
You know, the kind of pies
that have heroin in 'em

1211
00:45:36,664 --> 00:45:37,830
and guns and sex slaves.

1212
00:45:37,832 --> 00:45:39,433
You know,
all that kind of stuff.

1213
00:45:39,435 --> 00:45:41,734
But he just wanted me to help
him find this Faberge egg.

1214
00:45:41,736 --> 00:45:44,104
Fuck that! Faberge egg?

1215
00:45:44,106 --> 00:45:45,805
- Are you kidding me?
- No, I'm serious.

1216
00:45:45,807 --> 00:45:47,441
And I found it!

1217
00:45:47,443 --> 00:45:49,442
But then there was this other
guy, this Marlon Freeman.

1218
00:45:49,444 --> 00:45:51,444
He's willing to pay twice
as much for the same egg.

1219
00:45:51,446 --> 00:45:53,214
So what? So you screwed over
the Bulgarian guy,

1220
00:45:53,216 --> 00:45:55,015
and those fellows behind us
work for him,

1221
00:45:55,017 --> 00:45:56,383
and they just happen to crash
your murder mystery party?

1222
00:45:56,385 --> 00:46:00,187
I know, right?
What are the odds of that?

1223
00:46:00,189 --> 00:46:01,857
- Oh, too close, too close!
- Careful, careful!

1224
00:46:03,792 --> 00:46:05,225
Watch out! Watch out!

1225
00:46:05,227 --> 00:46:06,229
Oh, oh!

1226
00:46:08,698 --> 00:46:10,096
- Shit!
- Sorry! You okay?

1227
00:46:10,098 --> 00:46:11,397
- Yeah, I'm all right.
- Okay.

1228
00:46:11,399 --> 00:46:12,633
We need to go to the cops now!

1229
00:46:12,635 --> 00:46:13,868
- Yeah, right now! Let's go!
- No!

1230
00:46:13,870 --> 00:46:15,136
- We can't go to the cops!
- Why?

1231
00:46:15,138 --> 00:46:16,636
The Bulgarian's got
a ton of moles.

1232
00:46:16,638 --> 00:46:17,906
On his face?

1233
00:46:19,475 --> 00:46:21,042
No, in the police department.

1234
00:46:21,044 --> 00:46:22,312
Look out!

1235
00:46:23,611 --> 00:46:25,113
Careful!

1236
00:46:29,584 --> 00:46:31,119
Oh, my God!
This is insane!

1237
00:46:45,267 --> 00:46:47,567
If you call the cops, I'll be
dead before I get to jail.

1238
00:46:47,569 --> 00:46:49,502
Why don't we just get a hold
of this Marlon Freeman guy

1239
00:46:49,504 --> 00:46:51,270
and buy the egg back from him?

1240
00:46:51,272 --> 00:46:52,908
I couldn't find him if I wanted to.
That name's an alias.

1241
00:46:56,711 --> 00:46:58,013
- Gun, gun, gun! Duck!
- Oh, oh...

1242
00:47:08,256 --> 00:47:10,424
Okay, these guys are not
stopping. What do we do?

1243
00:47:10,426 --> 00:47:13,826
They're not gonna stop
until they get me.

1244
00:47:13,828 --> 00:47:16,662
I'm sorry I dragged
you guys into this.

1245
00:47:16,664 --> 00:47:19,034
I'm sorry for a lot of things.

1246
00:47:21,269 --> 00:47:23,105
- Hey! What are you doing?
- What is he doing?

1247
00:47:24,372 --> 00:47:26,740
- I love you, Max!
- Brooks, don't be an idiot!

1248
00:47:29,010 --> 00:47:30,213
<i>Stop the car!</i>

1249
00:47:38,821 --> 00:47:41,391
- Shit! Go, go, go!
- Okay, okay, okay!

1250
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:46,959
Fuck! What are we gonna do?
They're gonna kill my brother.

1251
00:47:46,961 --> 00:47:48,828
Oh, Annie, I feel faint.
I'm gonna pass out.

1252
00:47:48,830 --> 00:47:50,796
Oh, honey, we'll get you
to a hospital, okay?

1253
00:47:50,798 --> 00:47:52,165
No, no, no! No hospitals.

1254
00:47:52,167 --> 00:47:53,633
This is a gunshot wound,
they'll call the cops.

1255
00:47:53,635 --> 00:47:54,801
Shit, shit! Okay.

1256
00:47:54,803 --> 00:47:58,171
So, we go
to a mob doctor, right?

1257
00:47:58,173 --> 00:47:59,772
Do you know one of those,
sweetheart?

1258
00:47:59,774 --> 00:48:01,274
- No.
- No.

1259
00:48:01,276 --> 00:48:03,877
What about a veterinarian
that works for the mob?

1260
00:48:03,879 --> 00:48:05,578
- You know one of those?
- No.

1261
00:48:05,580 --> 00:48:07,214
Come on. Why are you pitching
all the mob stuff?

1262
00:48:07,216 --> 00:48:08,549
Because I'm losing
my shit here!

1263
00:48:08,551 --> 00:48:09,649
I get it.

1264
00:48:09,651 --> 00:48:10,783
You're gonna have to do it.

1265
00:48:10,785 --> 00:48:12,086
- What?
- Yup.

1266
00:48:12,088 --> 00:48:13,319
You're gonna have
to take the bullet out.

1267
00:48:13,321 --> 00:48:14,520
I don't wanna do it.

1268
00:48:14,522 --> 00:48:15,855
You think I want you
to take the bullet out?

1269
00:48:15,857 --> 00:48:16,890
I've seen you try
to cut a chicken.

1270
00:48:16,892 --> 00:48:18,225
We have no other option.

1271
00:48:18,227 --> 00:48:20,694
Oh, my God!
This is so bad!

1272
00:48:20,696 --> 00:48:22,331
I hate game night!

1273
00:48:25,700 --> 00:48:27,836
Thank you!

1274
00:48:28,569 --> 00:48:29,970
Hey!

1275
00:48:29,972 --> 00:48:31,470
Oh, thank God. Listen, Annie.
It's all real.

1276
00:48:31,472 --> 00:48:32,805
<i>Oh, no, I know.</i>

1277
00:48:32,807 --> 00:48:34,506
Brooks is caught up
in something and...

1278
00:48:34,508 --> 00:48:36,008
Okay, where are you guys?

1279
00:48:36,010 --> 00:48:37,410
We're all at Brooks's.
We need to talk to the cops.

1280
00:48:37,412 --> 00:48:39,814
<i>No! No, no, no!
Do not talk to the cops!</i>

1281
00:48:39,816 --> 00:48:41,048
What? Why? What's going on?

1282
00:48:41,050 --> 00:48:42,482
- Are you guys okay?
- <i>Yeah, yeah.</i>

1283
00:48:42,484 --> 00:48:44,819
We're fine, we're fine.
I shot Max, but he's fine.

1284
00:48:44,821 --> 00:48:46,153
What?

1285
00:48:46,155 --> 00:48:47,520
<i>Look. We will meet you
back at our house.</i>

1286
00:48:47,522 --> 00:48:49,189
Whatever you do,
do not tell the cops anything.

1287
00:48:49,191 --> 00:48:51,493
Brooks's life depends on it.

1288
00:48:56,365 --> 00:48:57,832
- Hey.
- <i>Hi.</i>

1289
00:48:57,834 --> 00:48:59,066
Okay.

1290
00:48:59,068 --> 00:49:00,433
I got a bunch of stuff.

1291
00:49:00,435 --> 00:49:02,002
Yeah.

1292
00:49:02,004 --> 00:49:04,037
Pocket knife. Tweezers.

1293
00:49:04,039 --> 00:49:05,406
Sewing kit. Gauze.

1294
00:49:05,408 --> 00:49:07,174
Good, good. All right.
Wow, you did great!

1295
00:49:07,176 --> 00:49:09,776
Yeah. And they didn't
have rubbing alcohol.

1296
00:49:09,778 --> 00:49:11,176
And they don't sell
hard liquor,

1297
00:49:11,178 --> 00:49:12,812
so I got you
this lovely Chard.

1298
00:49:12,814 --> 00:49:15,048
Good idea.
Way to pivot, yep. Good girl.

1299
00:49:15,050 --> 00:49:17,383
What else did you get?
More good stuff?

1300
00:49:17,385 --> 00:49:19,852
What is helpful in
<i>Country Living?</i>

1301
00:49:19,854 --> 00:49:21,421
Oh, that's for later.

1302
00:49:21,423 --> 00:49:23,656
There's a corn chowder recipe
that looks really good.

1303
00:49:23,658 --> 00:49:25,926
- You love corn chowder, huh?
- Sweet. I do, yeah.

1304
00:49:25,928 --> 00:49:26,993
- That'll cheer you up.
- Thank you.

1305
00:49:26,995 --> 00:49:28,462
Okay. And then, a squeaky toy.

1306
00:49:28,464 --> 00:49:30,062
- Huh.
- For your mouth.

1307
00:49:30,064 --> 00:49:31,397
- For the pain.
- Mmm-hmm.

1308
00:49:31,399 --> 00:49:33,000
Okay. Well, hopefully
I won't need this.

1309
00:49:33,002 --> 00:49:35,002
- Okay, let's see this bad boy.
- All right.

1310
00:49:35,004 --> 00:49:36,203
Yeah, careful.

1311
00:49:36,205 --> 00:49:37,904
- Okay.
- All right.

1312
00:49:39,006 --> 00:49:40,439
- Okay.
- Okay.

1313
00:49:40,441 --> 00:49:42,075
- We're gonna push past it.
- No problem. No problem.

1314
00:49:42,077 --> 00:49:43,377
- We'll get the bullet out.
- Let's just google.

1315
00:49:43,379 --> 00:49:45,011
Honey, can you return
the text later?

1316
00:49:45,013 --> 00:49:45,879
This is instructions
on how to remove a bullet.

1317
00:49:45,881 --> 00:49:47,046
Oh, sorry.

1318
00:49:47,048 --> 00:49:48,381
It's an alt-right
militia website,

1319
00:49:48,383 --> 00:49:50,283
so I'm just gonna ignore
the racist stuff.

1320
00:49:50,285 --> 00:49:51,618
- Good. Good, good.
- Yeah?

1321
00:49:51,620 --> 00:49:53,520
Okay. "Step one,
sterile gloves."

1322
00:49:53,522 --> 00:49:54,788
Check!

1323
00:49:54,790 --> 00:49:56,089
We're doing
the best we can, right?

1324
00:49:56,091 --> 00:49:57,857
Okay. Yeah. We're getting by.

1325
00:49:57,859 --> 00:49:59,225
"Step two."

1326
00:49:59,227 --> 00:50:02,263
Um... Okay.
"Disinfect wound."

1327
00:50:02,265 --> 00:50:04,564
Right, yeah.
That's gonna sting, isn't it?

1328
00:50:04,566 --> 00:50:05,765
Yeah, a little bit. Yeah.

1329
00:50:05,767 --> 00:50:07,332
- Let's do it.
- Okay?

1330
00:50:09,071 --> 00:50:11,571
That smarts, huh?

1331
00:50:11,573 --> 00:50:13,173
Yeah.

1332
00:50:13,175 --> 00:50:15,508
Gonna administer anesthetic.

1333
00:50:15,510 --> 00:50:16,442
We don't have that.

1334
00:50:16,444 --> 00:50:18,044
Just gonna skip that one.
Okay.

1335
00:50:18,046 --> 00:50:19,345
"Step four, apply pressure
above the wound."

1336
00:50:19,347 --> 00:50:21,381
Here, you squeeze that there.

1337
00:50:21,383 --> 00:50:22,982
- I got it.
- Great. Thank you.

1338
00:50:22,984 --> 00:50:25,285
We're just gonna make
two tiny incisions...

1339
00:50:25,287 --> 00:50:26,218
Oh, my God.

1340
00:50:26,220 --> 00:50:27,421
On either side
of the wound.

1341
00:50:27,423 --> 00:50:29,423
Easy-peasy.

1342
00:50:29,425 --> 00:50:30,656
This is fun, huh?

1343
00:50:30,658 --> 00:50:32,424
- Are you having fun?
- No.

1344
00:50:32,426 --> 00:50:33,926
- Let's get the bullet.
- Okay. Here we go.

1345
00:50:33,928 --> 00:50:35,229
Let's get in there and get it.

1346
00:50:35,231 --> 00:50:36,863
Nice and small,
nice and small, baby.

1347
00:50:36,865 --> 00:50:38,564
Okay. Yeah, yeah. Tiny, teeny.

1348
00:50:42,171 --> 00:50:44,738
That's not small.
That's really big!

1349
00:50:44,740 --> 00:50:46,272
So big?

1350
00:50:46,274 --> 00:50:47,941
Way too big, baby. It's
a bullet, not a grapefruit.

1351
00:50:47,943 --> 00:50:50,176
I'm sorry! I'm sorry. This is
my first time. I don't know...

1352
00:50:50,178 --> 00:50:51,879
Oh, there's so much blood.

1353
00:50:53,149 --> 00:50:54,814
No, no.
Don't you start doing that.

1354
00:50:54,816 --> 00:50:56,450
No, you're gonna make...

1355
00:50:59,321 --> 00:51:00,687
- I'm sorry.
- Stop it.

1356
00:51:00,689 --> 00:51:02,288
I'm looking at you
and you're making me...

1357
00:51:02,290 --> 00:51:03,689
Well, don't look at me.
I won't look at it.

1358
00:51:03,691 --> 00:51:05,691
- Push through. Let's go.
- Okay. All right, okay.

1359
00:51:05,693 --> 00:51:07,227
- No more cutting.
- Oh, shit.

1360
00:51:07,229 --> 00:51:08,160
Just get the tweezers
and get the bullet out, baby.

1361
00:51:08,162 --> 00:51:09,162
Shit, shit, shit. Um...

1362
00:51:09,164 --> 00:51:10,229
What? What happened?

1363
00:51:10,231 --> 00:51:11,497
Phone went to sleep.

1364
00:51:11,499 --> 00:51:13,100
You gotta set it
so that thing stays on.

1365
00:51:13,102 --> 00:51:14,368
- No. My phone doesn't do that.
- Sure it does.

1366
00:51:14,370 --> 00:51:16,169
Same phone as mine.
Just change it.

1367
00:51:16,171 --> 00:51:17,638
Just gonna touch it with my nose
every 30 seconds. It's fine.

1368
00:51:17,640 --> 00:51:18,872
Don't be afraid of your phone.

1369
00:51:18,874 --> 00:51:20,140
Get in there,
go to the settings,

1370
00:51:20,142 --> 00:51:21,408
go to display
and change the timing

1371
00:51:21,410 --> 00:51:22,442
so that it doesn't revert
to sleep mode.

1372
00:51:22,444 --> 00:51:23,743
- Revert?
- Yeah.

1373
00:51:23,745 --> 00:51:25,278
What are you, Steve Jobs?
I'm not reverting anything.

1374
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:26,212
I'm just not afraid
of my phone, honey.

1375
00:51:26,214 --> 00:51:27,546
It's so fucking simple.

1376
00:51:27,548 --> 00:51:29,415
Shh! Quiet.
I know what I'm doing, okay?

1377
00:51:29,417 --> 00:51:30,649
Do you?

1378
00:51:30,651 --> 00:51:31,817
Yes.

1379
00:51:31,819 --> 00:51:33,819
- Here she goes.
- Here we go.

1380
00:51:33,821 --> 00:51:35,120
You're like a dolphin.

1381
00:51:35,122 --> 00:51:37,156
All right.
This part's gonna hurt.

1382
00:51:37,158 --> 00:51:38,625
I don't... I don't doubt it.

1383
00:51:38,627 --> 00:51:39,825
Okay, let's do this.

1384
00:51:39,827 --> 00:51:41,294
Okay.

1385
00:51:42,365 --> 00:51:43,863
Ooh... Oh, wait.

1386
00:51:43,865 --> 00:51:45,732
What is that?

1387
00:51:45,734 --> 00:51:47,000
You hear that?

1388
00:51:47,002 --> 00:51:48,502
What's that sound?
What's that sound?

1389
00:51:48,504 --> 00:51:49,535
Is that the bullet?

1390
00:51:49,537 --> 00:51:52,171
- That's bone!
- What?

1391
00:51:52,173 --> 00:51:53,906
That's not right.

1392
00:51:53,908 --> 00:51:57,877
Okay. What do the racists say
if you can't find the bullet?

1393
00:51:57,879 --> 00:51:59,379
Yeah, that's bone.
You got the bone.

1394
00:51:59,381 --> 00:52:01,515
I'm looking at my bone.
Look right here.

1395
00:52:01,517 --> 00:52:04,986
Max,
did you get shot twice?

1396
00:52:07,955 --> 00:52:09,522
That's the exit wound.

1397
00:52:09,524 --> 00:52:11,091
Oh, it came out!

1398
00:52:11,093 --> 00:52:12,892
Yup. Nothing to remove.

1399
00:52:12,894 --> 00:52:14,227
The bullet has exited the arm.

1400
00:52:14,229 --> 00:52:16,029
Well, let's just sew
that sucker up, huh?

1401
00:52:16,031 --> 00:52:17,332
Yeah.

1402
00:52:18,499 --> 00:52:21,301
No, no. Honey, don't,
don't look at...

1403
00:52:21,303 --> 00:52:22,636
Stop it.

1404
00:52:24,972 --> 00:52:26,205
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

1405
00:52:26,207 --> 00:52:27,807
Now, the Bulgarian's guys
have Brooks,

1406
00:52:27,809 --> 00:52:29,276
and the only way
to save him

1407
00:52:29,278 --> 00:52:30,977
is to get that egg from this
Marlon Freeman guy.

1408
00:52:30,979 --> 00:52:33,747
I can't believe your brother's
been lying to us this whole time.

1409
00:52:33,749 --> 00:52:35,381
He's even cooler
than we thought.

1410
00:52:35,383 --> 00:52:37,785
Honey, I think you sewed
my arm to my sleeve.

1411
00:52:37,787 --> 00:52:40,187
I didn't even know Morgan
Freeman collected Faberge eggs.

1412
00:52:40,189 --> 00:52:42,089
Aren't those worth
millions of dollars?

1413
00:52:42,091 --> 00:52:43,924
It's Marlon Freeman,
but that's just an alias.

1414
00:52:43,926 --> 00:52:46,258
Somehow, we gotta find out his
real name, find out his address.

1415
00:52:46,260 --> 00:52:48,394
- Police computer.
- What do you mean?

1416
00:52:48,396 --> 00:52:50,662
I once dated this girl
whose father was a cop.

1417
00:52:50,664 --> 00:52:52,566
She showed me
her dad's police computer.

1418
00:52:52,568 --> 00:52:55,468
It has a database with
every known alias on it.

1419
00:52:55,470 --> 00:52:58,171
I bet we could find Marlon
Wayans' real name on it.

1420
00:52:58,173 --> 00:52:59,540
So, if we called her up,

1421
00:52:59,542 --> 00:53:01,006
would she let you go
on her dad's computer?

1422
00:53:01,008 --> 00:53:03,542
No. No way! That ended badly.

1423
00:53:03,544 --> 00:53:05,345
So, how are we gonna get into
a police computer

1424
00:53:05,347 --> 00:53:06,546
without the cops knowing?

1425
00:53:06,548 --> 00:53:07,781
- Billy Bob Thornton!
- What?

1426
00:53:07,783 --> 00:53:09,149
- What?
- You slept with

1427
00:53:09,151 --> 00:53:11,384
- Billy Bob, didn't you?
- Hang on, hang on!

1428
00:53:11,386 --> 00:53:13,722
I know where we can
get on a police computer.

1429
00:53:15,356 --> 00:53:18,091
- Hey!
- Gary!

1430
00:53:18,093 --> 00:53:20,026
Goodness.

1431
00:53:20,028 --> 00:53:22,194
To what do Bastian and I
owe the pleasure?

1432
00:53:22,196 --> 00:53:23,729
Well, we were
all just talking,

1433
00:53:23,731 --> 00:53:26,566
and we realized we haven't had
a game night in ages.

1434
00:53:26,568 --> 00:53:29,269
- Just the seven of us.
- So...

1435
00:53:29,271 --> 00:53:31,238
I thought you were going
to your brother's house.

1436
00:53:31,240 --> 00:53:32,705
I never said that.

1437
00:53:32,707 --> 00:53:34,674
Come on, Gare Bear. Live
a little! It's the weekend!

1438
00:53:34,676 --> 00:53:36,743
We were just saying how you
were always better at games

1439
00:53:36,745 --> 00:53:38,111
than Debbie was.

1440
00:53:38,113 --> 00:53:40,747
I'll thank you
not to besmirch my ex-wife.

1441
00:53:40,749 --> 00:53:42,216
That woman is an angel.

1442
00:53:42,218 --> 00:53:46,754
Oh. Yeah, she was much better
at games than you.

1443
00:53:46,756 --> 00:53:53,162
I will admit I have eagerly
awaited a visit such as this.

1444
00:53:59,167 --> 00:54:00,933
Where'd he go?

1445
00:54:00,935 --> 00:54:02,701
Do we follow him?

1446
00:54:02,703 --> 00:54:03,736
It seems like it.

1447
00:54:03,738 --> 00:54:05,640
- Ryan, you go first.
- I'm scared.

1448
00:54:11,914 --> 00:54:14,948
Help yourself to popped corn
with sea salt.

1449
00:54:14,950 --> 00:54:17,383
Oh! Oh!

1450
00:54:17,385 --> 00:54:19,551
<i>Yummy, yummy.</i>

1451
00:54:19,553 --> 00:54:21,220
I can't believe
that you read my mind.

1452
00:54:21,222 --> 00:54:22,522
I was craving popcorn.

1453
00:54:22,524 --> 00:54:24,957
You have a framed photo
of game night?

1454
00:54:24,959 --> 00:54:26,325
Doesn't everyone
have photographs

1455
00:54:26,327 --> 00:54:28,563
of their best friends
in their homes?

1456
00:54:30,131 --> 00:54:33,133
<i>Of course. We do.</i>

1457
00:54:33,135 --> 00:54:35,000
Max, you wanna go first?

1458
00:54:35,002 --> 00:54:37,069
Okay, I'll start. I'll do it.

1459
00:54:37,071 --> 00:54:38,537
Oh. There's a loose one.

1460
00:54:38,539 --> 00:54:41,207
Always in the middle.
That's where you wanna go.

1461
00:54:41,209 --> 00:54:42,741
Can I use your john
real quick?

1462
00:54:42,743 --> 00:54:45,213
Of course. It's the end
of the hall, next to our...

1463
00:54:48,651 --> 00:54:50,419
My bedroom.

1464
00:54:51,854 --> 00:54:52,855
Okay.

1465
00:55:15,109 --> 00:55:16,845
Oh, no, Gary.

1466
00:55:44,606 --> 00:55:48,875
So, Sarah, how long
have you two been a couple?

1467
00:55:48,877 --> 00:55:51,544
Oh, no! No, we're not.
We just...

1468
00:55:51,546 --> 00:55:53,513
We work together.
I wouldn't, um...

1469
00:55:53,515 --> 00:55:54,580
I wouldn't do that thing.

1470
00:55:54,582 --> 00:55:57,383
I see. I thought I detected

1471
00:55:57,385 --> 00:56:00,386
a certain chemistry
between the two of you.

1472
00:56:00,388 --> 00:56:03,423
No. No way.

1473
00:56:03,425 --> 00:56:06,158
- No, that's not...
- Mmm. Mmm.

1474
00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:07,426
Then again,
I'm not the best judge

1475
00:56:07,428 --> 00:56:09,930
of chemistry
in the world.

1476
00:56:17,772 --> 00:56:19,372
Hmm.

1477
00:56:19,374 --> 00:56:21,310
Oh, because
your wife left you.

1478
00:56:21,943 --> 00:56:22,944
Oh, shit.

1479
00:56:32,521 --> 00:56:34,856
Hello, Donald Anderton.

1480
00:56:43,798 --> 00:56:45,501
Oh!

1481
00:56:46,401 --> 00:56:48,767
<i>So many possible moves.</i>

1482
00:56:48,769 --> 00:56:51,239
I just don't know
where to begin.

1483
00:56:53,073 --> 00:56:55,741
Um, maybe... Ooh...

1484
00:56:55,743 --> 00:56:57,144
- Decision-making.
- Come on, Annie.

1485
00:56:57,146 --> 00:56:58,076
Just make up your mind.
Please.

1486
00:56:58,078 --> 00:56:59,281
- No!
- No?

1487
00:57:01,383 --> 00:57:04,520
Yup, take your time.

1488
00:57:36,084 --> 00:57:39,622
Oh, Brooks. What have you
gotten yourself into?

1489
00:57:56,703 --> 00:58:01,707
Oh, shit. Where did you
come from, little guy?

1490
00:58:01,709 --> 00:58:06,011
Son of a bitch.
Hey! What are you, a vampire?

1491
00:58:06,013 --> 00:58:08,716
Oh, God. Oh, God.

1492
00:58:11,419 --> 00:58:14,854
Oh, my God.
Has that got it?

1493
00:58:14,856 --> 00:58:19,394
No, that doesn't got it.
God damn it. Come on!

1494
00:58:23,263 --> 00:58:24,466
No!

1495
00:58:26,267 --> 00:58:27,500
I should go check on him.

1496
00:58:27,502 --> 00:58:28,901
I think he's fine.

1497
00:58:28,903 --> 00:58:32,040
- He cried out.
- Tell me about Debbie.

1498
00:58:35,010 --> 00:58:36,875
I beg your pardon.

1499
00:58:36,877 --> 00:58:38,076
Oh, just, I...

1500
00:58:38,078 --> 00:58:41,482
I never met her. I'd love
to hear all about her.

1501
00:58:52,227 --> 00:58:53,727
Where do I begin?

1502
00:58:53,729 --> 00:58:55,194
All right,
you wanna take a bath?

1503
00:58:55,196 --> 00:58:56,529
We'll take a little bath.

1504
00:58:56,531 --> 00:59:01,570
There we go. Okay.
All right. Here we go.

1505
00:59:03,571 --> 00:59:06,742
There we go, huh? Huh?

1506
00:59:08,010 --> 00:59:09,709
Oh, it's so much worse.

1507
00:59:09,711 --> 00:59:11,778
Oh, God.
And what did I do to this?

1508
00:59:11,780 --> 00:59:13,482
What the fuck is this thing?

1509
00:59:14,883 --> 00:59:16,049
Oh, Debbie.

1510
00:59:16,051 --> 00:59:17,553
Oh!

1511
00:59:24,892 --> 00:59:27,694
Okay. Fuck this.

1512
00:59:27,696 --> 00:59:29,629
Hey, guys, Gary was right.
It's awful late.

1513
00:59:29,631 --> 00:59:31,029
Let's get home,
get to bed, huh?

1514
00:59:31,031 --> 00:59:32,332
Get out of his hair.

1515
00:59:32,334 --> 00:59:34,366
We haven't finished the game.
It's your turn, Max.

1516
00:59:34,368 --> 00:59:35,769
Oh, my turn, huh?

1517
00:59:35,771 --> 00:59:38,404
Okay, be careful now, Max.
Oh!

1518
00:59:38,406 --> 00:59:40,339
Well, game over.
I went in a little hot.

1519
00:59:40,341 --> 00:59:41,441
Why did you...

1520
00:59:41,443 --> 00:59:43,408
Thanks.
Good to see you, Gary.

1521
00:59:43,410 --> 00:59:45,745
When shall we play next?

1522
00:59:45,747 --> 00:59:48,684
<i>Soon.
We'll call you.</i>

1523
00:59:53,555 --> 00:59:56,589
Bastian. Baby!

1524
00:59:58,026 --> 01:00:00,392
So, how are we supposed
to get this egg

1525
01:00:00,394 --> 01:00:02,127
out of
Donald Anderton's house?

1526
01:00:02,129 --> 01:00:04,830
I don't know.
I'm gonna figure it out.

1527
01:00:04,832 --> 01:00:07,801
"Unknown Caller."
Please don't be Gary.

1528
01:00:07,803 --> 01:00:08,935
Hello?

1529
01:00:08,937 --> 01:00:10,806
<i>We have your brother.</i>

1530
01:00:11,339 --> 01:00:12,471
Um...

1531
01:00:12,473 --> 01:00:13,906
Okay. We know
where the egg is,

1532
01:00:13,908 --> 01:00:15,341
and we're actually
on our way there right now.

1533
01:00:15,343 --> 01:00:16,942
We can do a swap, okay?
Please don't hurt Brooks.

1534
01:00:16,944 --> 01:00:18,845
<i>Meet us on the East
4th Street bridge</i>

1535
01:00:18,847 --> 01:00:20,879
<i>at midnight.
If you're late, he dies.</i>

1536
01:00:20,881 --> 01:00:22,883
- Oh, my God.
- Um...

1537
01:00:22,885 --> 01:00:25,988
Boy, that's less than
an hour from now.

1538
01:00:27,055 --> 01:00:28,053
Hello?

1539
01:00:28,055 --> 01:00:29,754
What's up
with this guy's voice?

1540
01:00:29,756 --> 01:00:31,558
He sounds like a monster.

1541
01:00:31,560 --> 01:00:33,225
He's using
a voice changer, Ryan.

1542
01:00:33,227 --> 01:00:35,897
He still sounds like
a scary monster.

1543
01:00:39,100 --> 01:00:43,435
And we are here.

1544
01:00:43,437 --> 01:00:44,904
All right, you guys head home,

1545
01:00:44,906 --> 01:00:46,339
and I will call as soon as
I get the egg, all right?

1546
01:00:46,341 --> 01:00:48,040
What? Wait a second, wait.
I'm going with you.

1547
01:00:48,042 --> 01:00:50,142
No, Annie. It could be very
dangerous in there, okay?

1548
01:00:50,144 --> 01:00:51,778
Listen, you know,
Brooks shouldn't have dragged

1549
01:00:51,780 --> 01:00:53,412
any of us into this,
but he is my brother.

1550
01:00:53,414 --> 01:00:54,781
And it's up to me to fix it.

1551
01:00:54,783 --> 01:00:56,082
No, bullshit!
We're all in this together!

1552
01:00:56,084 --> 01:00:57,783
- Ryan!
- No, no. No. Max is right.

1553
01:00:57,785 --> 01:01:00,986
You guys should go home,
but you and I are doing this.

1554
01:01:00,988 --> 01:01:03,223
Okay, what happens
if you guys don't make it out?

1555
01:01:03,225 --> 01:01:04,857
We don't come
to game night

1556
01:01:04,859 --> 01:01:06,024
because we're dying to play
Charades and shit.

1557
01:01:06,026 --> 01:01:07,627
We come because
we love you guys.

1558
01:01:07,629 --> 01:01:09,261
Honestly, this is
the best part of our week.

1559
01:01:09,263 --> 01:01:12,099
Mine, too. And I have a lot
of options on the weekend.

1560
01:01:12,935 --> 01:01:14,801
Wow. You guys...

1561
01:01:14,803 --> 01:01:17,136
Thank you. That's very nice.

1562
01:01:17,138 --> 01:01:19,973
Aw, good friends.

1563
01:01:19,975 --> 01:01:21,741
You should probably go,
though, right?

1564
01:01:21,743 --> 01:01:23,676
I mean,
you don't even know us.

1565
01:01:23,678 --> 01:01:25,278
Yeah, why are you still here?

1566
01:01:25,280 --> 01:01:29,549
Oh. I don't know.
I just got caught up in it.

1567
01:01:29,551 --> 01:01:31,183
Also, if I go home now,
and then I read

1568
01:01:31,185 --> 01:01:32,884
in the newspaper tomorrow
that you all died,

1569
01:01:32,886 --> 01:01:36,492
I'll feel shit that I left,
so I'm gonna stick around.

1570
01:01:37,492 --> 01:01:39,691
You still read the newspaper?

1571
01:01:39,693 --> 01:01:41,593
That's what you got from that?

1572
01:01:41,595 --> 01:01:43,164
How are we gonna
get into this place?

1573
01:01:45,432 --> 01:01:47,668
Go! Go! Go! Go!

1574
01:01:54,276 --> 01:01:56,810
Okay.

1575
01:01:56,812 --> 01:01:58,676
<i>Looks like they got
a party going on.</i>

1576
01:01:58,678 --> 01:01:59,947
<i>This could be good.</i>

1577
01:02:11,959 --> 01:02:14,729
Where is everybody?

1578
01:02:30,245 --> 01:02:31,647
No way!

1579
01:02:39,854 --> 01:02:42,287
It's some kind of
rich guy's fight club.

1580
01:02:42,289 --> 01:02:45,159
I knew it. They are real.

1581
01:02:49,062 --> 01:02:50,131
Come on!

1582
01:03:01,443 --> 01:03:05,477
That's my Boomer!
That's my Boomer!

1583
01:03:05,479 --> 01:03:08,214
Man, this is some
<i>Django Unchained</i> bullshit.

1584
01:03:08,216 --> 01:03:09,881
Water!

1585
01:03:09,883 --> 01:03:12,984
That's my boy!
Good boy! Good boy!

1586
01:03:12,986 --> 01:03:15,453
Rich people are fucked up!

1587
01:03:15,455 --> 01:03:17,723
Kramer, get Logan ready!

1588
01:03:17,725 --> 01:03:20,725
Okay, minimum buy-in
is now 10 grand.

1589
01:03:20,727 --> 01:03:22,160
Okay, I think
we should split up.

1590
01:03:22,162 --> 01:03:23,863
Yeah.
And let's start upstairs.

1591
01:03:23,865 --> 01:03:25,397
Anybody finds the egg,
just text the others, okay?

1592
01:03:25,399 --> 01:03:27,566
And for God's sake, be careful
with it. All right?

1593
01:03:27,568 --> 01:03:29,870
- Gotcha. I got it.
- Be safe.

1594
01:03:31,305 --> 01:03:33,173
What are you...
What are you doing?

1595
01:03:33,175 --> 01:03:35,374
Who says the egg
isn't in here?

1596
01:03:35,376 --> 01:03:38,343
Also, I have a really good
feeling about Logan.

1597
01:03:38,345 --> 01:03:41,881
Egg, egg, egg.
Wow! This is some bedroom.

1598
01:03:41,883 --> 01:03:43,616
Does it remind you
of your celebrity boyfriend's?

1599
01:03:43,618 --> 01:03:44,850
Are you still on this?

1600
01:03:44,852 --> 01:03:46,486
Yes, I'm still on this,
Michelle.

1601
01:03:46,488 --> 01:03:47,787
That's all I can think about.

1602
01:03:47,789 --> 01:03:49,421
And that's saying a lot,
considering we got

1603
01:03:49,423 --> 01:03:51,924
<i>Eyes Wide Fight Club</i>
going on downstairs.

1604
01:03:51,926 --> 01:03:53,892
Why is this
so important to you?

1605
01:03:53,894 --> 01:03:55,560
Because, Michelle, look,

1606
01:03:55,562 --> 01:03:57,696
I am losing my mind here.
Okay?

1607
01:03:57,698 --> 01:03:59,064
We were broken up at the time.

1608
01:03:59,066 --> 01:04:00,765
I got a hand job
from Karen Waller,

1609
01:04:00,767 --> 01:04:02,868
so you had every right to.

1610
01:04:02,870 --> 01:04:04,306
So, why not just tell me?

1611
01:04:06,240 --> 01:04:08,275
Okay, fine.

1612
01:04:09,943 --> 01:04:11,609
<i>It was 10 years ago.</i>

1613
01:04:11,611 --> 01:04:13,011
<i>I was at a gas station,</i>

1614
01:04:13,013 --> 01:04:15,416
<i>and I noticed a guy
at the next pump.</i>

1615
01:04:17,084 --> 01:04:21,120
<i>It was Denzel Washington.</i>

1616
01:04:21,122 --> 01:04:22,324
Hold up.

1617
01:04:23,725 --> 01:04:26,191
It actually was Denzel?

1618
01:04:26,193 --> 01:04:27,261
Yeah.

1619
01:04:31,298 --> 01:04:32,964
<i>He was really nice.</i>

1620
01:04:32,966 --> 01:04:35,000
<i>He made some joke
about how premium gas</i>

1621
01:04:35,002 --> 01:04:36,836
<i>is probably the same
as regular.</i>

1622
01:04:36,838 --> 01:04:38,069
<i>I took a chance,
and I asked him</i>

1623
01:04:38,071 --> 01:04:39,571
<i>if he wanted to get drinks.</i>

1624
01:04:39,573 --> 01:04:41,441
<i>He said yes.</i>

1625
01:04:41,443 --> 01:04:42,875
<i>We both got a little tipsy.</i>

1626
01:04:42,877 --> 01:04:44,910
<i>I offered to pay for drinks,
and he let me,</i>

1627
01:04:44,912 --> 01:04:47,115
<i>which I thought
was pretty cool.</i>

1628
01:04:47,847 --> 01:04:50,317
<i>We danced for hours.</i>

1629
01:04:52,921 --> 01:04:54,752
<i>Eventually, we ended up
back at his place,</i>

1630
01:04:54,754 --> 01:04:57,858
<i>and one thing led to another.</i>

1631
01:04:59,294 --> 01:05:02,361
It was just this crazy thing
that happened

1632
01:05:02,363 --> 01:05:04,363
and, in a weird way,
it made me realize

1633
01:05:04,365 --> 01:05:08,069
the only person
I ever wanna be with is you.

1634
01:05:09,669 --> 01:05:11,002
Nah.

1635
01:05:11,004 --> 01:05:12,772
Nah. I don't believe it.

1636
01:05:12,774 --> 01:05:14,307
- Oh, you...
- Mmm-mmm.

1637
01:05:14,309 --> 01:05:16,542
Well, I took a picture
with him at the club.

1638
01:05:16,544 --> 01:05:18,345
I put it in a hidden folder.

1639
01:05:19,546 --> 01:05:20,848
Denzel and Michelle.

1640
01:05:26,488 --> 01:05:28,187
Yeah, baby, that's not Denzel.

1641
01:05:28,189 --> 01:05:29,055
Yeah, it is.

1642
01:05:29,057 --> 01:05:30,756
Mmm. No, it's not.

1643
01:05:30,758 --> 01:05:33,160
Dude looks
a lot like Denzel,

1644
01:05:33,794 --> 01:05:35,261
but it's not him.

1645
01:05:35,263 --> 01:05:37,296
You're crazy. That's...
Look at that, that's Denzel.

1646
01:05:37,298 --> 01:05:39,799
Okay, let me ask you this.
Did he say he was Denzel?

1647
01:05:39,801 --> 01:05:41,700
Well, no...

1648
01:05:41,702 --> 01:05:44,470
He tried to introduce himself,
and I cut him off

1649
01:05:44,472 --> 01:05:47,141
because I told him
I knew who he was.

1650
01:05:49,310 --> 01:05:51,644
- What kind of car did he drive?
- A BMW.

1651
01:05:51,646 --> 01:05:53,513
- Hmm.
- Three series.

1652
01:05:53,515 --> 01:05:56,549
Mmm. What was his place like?

1653
01:05:56,551 --> 01:05:59,054
It was a two-bedroom condo.

1654
01:06:00,588 --> 01:06:05,625
And he used the spare room
as an office, so...

1655
01:06:05,627 --> 01:06:07,426
Do you hear
what you're saying right now?

1656
01:06:07,428 --> 01:06:10,062
Hold on, let me see.

1657
01:06:10,064 --> 01:06:12,434
When you zoom in,
the nose gives it away, right?

1658
01:06:13,533 --> 01:06:14,866
- Goddamn!
- Mmm-hmm.

1659
01:06:14,868 --> 01:06:16,736
Look, don't beat yourself up
about it, okay?

1660
01:06:16,738 --> 01:06:18,370
There is some good news.

1661
01:06:18,372 --> 01:06:20,872
If you wanna get with Denzel,

1662
01:06:20,874 --> 01:06:23,109
he's standing right here!

1663
01:06:23,111 --> 01:06:28,013
Because the real
Denzel ain't got shit on me!

1664
01:06:30,350 --> 01:06:34,419
Honey, how does this monster
have five kids?

1665
01:06:34,421 --> 01:06:36,354
We don't get to have one.

1666
01:06:36,356 --> 01:06:38,790
Well, his wife looks like
she's about 15.

1667
01:06:38,792 --> 01:06:42,060
Uh... Yeah. My sperm are fine.

1668
01:06:42,062 --> 01:06:44,296
Right, right. No, I know,
honey. We're just gonna...

1669
01:06:44,298 --> 01:06:48,167
We're gonna keep plugging away
until something sticks, okay?

1670
01:06:48,169 --> 01:06:51,037
Gee, you really sound like a
guy who wants to have a kid.

1671
01:06:51,039 --> 01:06:52,337
Well, you know, I'm just...

1672
01:06:52,339 --> 01:06:54,173
I'm a little distracted
right now, honey,

1673
01:06:54,175 --> 01:06:55,674
as you might imagine.

1674
01:06:55,676 --> 01:06:59,745
Look, if you're not into this,
you kinda gotta tell me.

1675
01:06:59,747 --> 01:07:01,214
Listen.

1676
01:07:01,216 --> 01:07:05,683
I wanna have a baby, but
how do I explain this? Um...

1677
01:07:05,685 --> 01:07:08,654
Do you remember how we used to
play <i>Pac-Man</i> at Fisker Lanes

1678
01:07:08,656 --> 01:07:10,522
and we could play all night?

1679
01:07:10,524 --> 01:07:12,390
Do you remember this one time, I
made it all the way up to level 86,

1680
01:07:12,392 --> 01:07:14,292
- and you were not too far behind, right?
- 85, but...

1681
01:07:14,294 --> 01:07:15,662
And then I kicked your ass
at <i>Galaga.</i>

1682
01:07:15,664 --> 01:07:17,595
- So anyway, what is the point?
- Mmm... Anyway.

1683
01:07:17,597 --> 01:07:19,799
Do you remember
how we stayed alive so long?

1684
01:07:19,801 --> 01:07:21,667
All we did was
we ate the pellets.

1685
01:07:21,669 --> 01:07:24,839
We never ate the fruit because
the fruit is how they get you.

1686
01:07:26,240 --> 01:07:27,874
Oh, you're doing a metaphor!

1687
01:07:27,876 --> 01:07:29,441
Yes, but here's the problem.

1688
01:07:29,443 --> 01:07:32,078
No matter how long you and I
stayed alive in the game,

1689
01:07:32,080 --> 01:07:34,149
neither one of us ever made it
up to the leader board.

1690
01:07:35,249 --> 01:07:37,183
And you think
if we have a baby,

1691
01:07:37,185 --> 01:07:38,683
we'll be officially
settling down,

1692
01:07:38,685 --> 01:07:41,220
and you'll never make it
onto the leader board of life?

1693
01:07:41,222 --> 01:07:42,888
That's such a good metaphor.

1694
01:07:42,890 --> 01:07:44,055
Yeah, no, it's not.

1695
01:07:44,057 --> 01:07:46,191
- It's kind of bullshit.
- Why?

1696
01:07:46,193 --> 01:07:47,894
- What are we, 16 years old?
- No.

1697
01:07:47,896 --> 01:07:51,095
- You wanna go backpacking through Europe? Huh?
- Uh-uh.

1698
01:07:51,097 --> 01:07:53,098
You wanna, like,
have some wine coolers

1699
01:07:53,100 --> 01:07:56,368
on a football field
with Rebecca De Mornay?

1700
01:07:56,370 --> 01:07:57,602
Not specifically.

1701
01:07:57,604 --> 01:08:00,471
You know who's always gone
for the fruit, Max?

1702
01:08:00,473 --> 01:08:02,575
Your criminal brother,
and that is why

1703
01:08:02,577 --> 01:08:04,944
the ghosts
are about to eat him!

1704
01:08:04,946 --> 01:08:06,578
Look who's embracing
the metaphor.

1705
01:08:06,580 --> 01:08:09,415
I was so...
Wow. You know what?

1706
01:08:09,417 --> 01:08:11,250
All this time,
I've just been thinking

1707
01:08:11,252 --> 01:08:13,185
that if I helped you
beat Brooks,

1708
01:08:13,187 --> 01:08:15,053
you would be less stressed.

1709
01:08:15,055 --> 01:08:16,956
But you don't wanna
beat Brooks.

1710
01:08:16,958 --> 01:08:19,494
You wanna be Brooks.

1711
01:08:21,095 --> 01:08:23,431
I'm gonna look somewhere else.

1712
01:08:35,508 --> 01:08:38,344
Come on, Logan!
Boomer ain't shit!

1713
01:08:38,346 --> 01:08:39,644
Hey, ADHD!

1714
01:08:39,646 --> 01:08:41,315
We're supposed to be
looking for the...

1715
01:08:43,885 --> 01:08:46,588
Holy shit. I'm right again.

1716
01:08:48,623 --> 01:08:50,089
Wait, where are you going?

1717
01:08:50,091 --> 01:08:51,991
Everybody's watching the fight.
I'm gonna go grab it.

1718
01:08:51,993 --> 01:08:55,163
- No, don't fucking...
- Be cool, be cool.

1719
01:09:10,377 --> 01:09:12,580
Oh, shit!

1720
01:09:15,716 --> 01:09:16,718
Who the hell are you?

1721
01:09:17,752 --> 01:09:18,885
Me?

1722
01:09:18,887 --> 01:09:20,986
Yeah. Who are you?

1723
01:09:20,988 --> 01:09:22,721
And what are you doing
with my egg?

1724
01:09:22,723 --> 01:09:24,689
Oh. I was just admiring it.

1725
01:09:24,691 --> 01:09:27,193
I got a bunch of these
fancy-pants eggs

1726
01:09:27,195 --> 01:09:29,362
back at home. In my mansion.

1727
01:09:29,364 --> 01:09:32,167
- Uh-huh.
- This one's ugly. Hmm.

1728
01:09:33,068 --> 01:09:34,633
Does anybody know this guy?

1729
01:09:34,635 --> 01:09:37,268
I certainly hope so.

1730
01:09:37,270 --> 01:09:40,505
I'm the CEO
of Cyberdyne Systems.

1731
01:09:40,507 --> 01:09:42,773
I should go.

1732
01:09:42,775 --> 01:09:44,009
Boomer, take him down.

1733
01:09:44,011 --> 01:09:46,181
Everyone hold on
a goddamn second!

1734
01:09:50,650 --> 01:09:51,849
Boomer!

1735
01:09:56,658 --> 01:09:57,790
Hey, any luck yet?

1736
01:09:57,792 --> 01:09:59,024
- No.
- You?

1737
01:09:59,026 --> 01:10:01,260
Go! Go! Go!
I got it! I got it!

1738
01:10:01,262 --> 01:10:03,062
Let's go! Come on!

1739
01:10:13,074 --> 01:10:14,474
Sorry. Sorry.

1740
01:10:14,476 --> 01:10:15,643
Hey, Ryan! Ryan!

1741
01:10:16,110 --> 01:10:17,609
Oh, shit.

1742
01:10:17,611 --> 01:10:19,045
Um, uh...

1743
01:10:19,047 --> 01:10:20,679
Okay, okay.

1744
01:10:20,681 --> 01:10:22,149
Shit! Okay.

1745
01:10:25,218 --> 01:10:28,756
Michelle, I'm open!
Hit me. Baby.

1746
01:10:30,658 --> 01:10:32,858
- Oh-ho-ho!
- Security!

1747
01:10:32,860 --> 01:10:34,493
No, you don't.

1748
01:10:34,495 --> 01:10:35,960
Oh, shit!

1749
01:10:35,962 --> 01:10:37,162
Kev, up here! Throw it!

1750
01:10:37,164 --> 01:10:38,430
I got it!

1751
01:10:38,432 --> 01:10:41,666
Oh! Oh, my God, yes, yes!
Yes, yes, yes!

1752
01:10:41,668 --> 01:10:45,938
Oh, no! No! No!
Get away! Get away!

1753
01:10:49,677 --> 01:10:51,209
Okay. Oh!

1754
01:10:51,211 --> 01:10:52,678
<i>Go to the other side!</i>

1755
01:10:52,680 --> 01:10:54,479
Oh, my God!

1756
01:10:54,481 --> 01:10:56,514
<i>Annie! Annie,
where are you?</i>

1757
01:10:56,516 --> 01:10:59,486
- Max! Max!
- <i>Over here! Hey!</i>

1758
01:11:06,226 --> 01:11:07,660
<i>No! No, no.</i>

1759
01:11:09,829 --> 01:11:11,231
Get off me!

1760
01:11:14,802 --> 01:11:15,867
No!

1761
01:11:15,869 --> 01:11:17,204
Oh!

1762
01:11:18,137 --> 01:11:20,175
That was easy.

1763
01:11:28,749 --> 01:11:33,184
Man, glass tables
are acting weird tonight.

1764
01:11:33,186 --> 01:11:35,720
Go, go, go!

1765
01:11:35,722 --> 01:11:37,223
Get in the van!

1766
01:11:37,225 --> 01:11:38,956
Get in, get in, get in!

1767
01:11:38,958 --> 01:11:40,992
- Get 'em!
- Get 'em!

1768
01:11:55,776 --> 01:11:57,609
So, you don't wanna
have a baby,

1769
01:11:57,611 --> 01:11:59,513
so we can do
more shit like that?

1770
01:12:00,213 --> 01:12:02,480
No. No.

1771
01:12:02,482 --> 01:12:04,517
Is that the fruit
you were thinking about?

1772
01:12:04,519 --> 01:12:07,053
Mmm-mmm.
That's not the fruit. No.

1773
01:12:07,055 --> 01:12:08,720
Hey, thanks for the assist.

1774
01:12:08,722 --> 01:12:10,622
Yeah.

1775
01:12:10,624 --> 01:12:13,593
I don't even know why
I really did it.

1776
01:12:13,595 --> 01:12:15,126
Do you think it's 'cause
you're falling for me?

1777
01:12:17,864 --> 01:12:18,899
I...

1778
01:12:19,734 --> 01:12:21,767
Not... Not sure.

1779
01:12:21,769 --> 01:12:24,135
Ugh. I was joking.

1780
01:12:24,137 --> 01:12:26,839
Oh. Okay. Yeah.

1781
01:12:26,841 --> 01:12:29,207
Aren't you gonna say
you were joking, too?

1782
01:12:29,209 --> 01:12:32,077
- Do you want me to?
- Oh, my God,

1783
01:12:32,079 --> 01:12:33,679
- Stop it.
- Okay, fine.

1784
01:12:33,681 --> 01:12:35,447
It's two minutes to 12:00.
Where the hell is this bridge?

1785
01:12:35,449 --> 01:12:36,948
GPS says
it's right around here,

1786
01:12:36,950 --> 01:12:38,550
but I don't see it.

1787
01:12:38,552 --> 01:12:40,484
Oh, oh. Oh.
There it is. 4th Street.

1788
01:12:40,486 --> 01:12:43,288
Oh, shit!

1789
01:12:47,962 --> 01:12:50,528
- Oh, my.
- That's great.

1790
01:12:50,530 --> 01:12:52,833
That's great. Now they're
gonna kill my brother.

1791
01:12:54,802 --> 01:12:55,837
Oh, God!

1792
01:12:56,669 --> 01:12:58,804
Hold on.

1793
01:12:58,806 --> 01:13:01,740
I'm not an expert, but these
gems look plastic to me.

1794
01:13:01,742 --> 01:13:04,309
"Made in China."
Is this thing not even real?

1795
01:13:04,311 --> 01:13:06,144
Maybe just that sticker
was made in China.

1796
01:13:06,146 --> 01:13:07,379
- Let's let them talk.
- Can I see?

1797
01:13:07,381 --> 01:13:08,648
<i>Hey,
why would The Bulgarian</i>

1798
01:13:08,650 --> 01:13:10,549
<i>ask Brooks to bring him
a fake egg?</i>

1799
01:13:10,551 --> 01:13:13,518
Uh, I don't think
he wanted an egg at all.

1800
01:13:13,520 --> 01:13:16,723
I think he wanted
what was inside the egg.

1801
01:13:17,525 --> 01:13:19,858
"WITSEC."
What is that?

1802
01:13:19,860 --> 01:13:21,093
Um...

1803
01:13:21,095 --> 01:13:23,231
We could ask them?

1804
01:13:39,879 --> 01:13:41,913
You tell anyone
we were coming here?

1805
01:13:41,915 --> 01:13:43,415
No.

1806
01:13:43,417 --> 01:13:44,616
I've got your egg.

1807
01:13:44,618 --> 01:13:47,251
- You do?
- Yeah, but we broke it.

1808
01:13:47,253 --> 01:13:48,720
- What?
- Well, it was a fake.

1809
01:13:48,722 --> 01:13:50,589
But we have the list of names
that was inside.

1810
01:13:50,591 --> 01:13:52,293
That's what you wanted, right?

1811
01:13:55,395 --> 01:13:57,661
Okay. Get on the ground.

1812
01:13:57,663 --> 01:13:59,831
We've got what you want.
Can't you just let us go?

1813
01:13:59,833 --> 01:14:02,535
I said, "On the ground!"

1814
01:14:02,537 --> 01:14:04,303
You too, playboy, get over
there. Get on the ground.

1815
01:14:04,305 --> 01:14:05,804
Yeah.

1816
01:14:05,806 --> 01:14:07,906
<i>None of that
child pose shit, either.</i>

1817
01:14:07,908 --> 01:14:10,474
The Bulgarian's gonna kill me,
probably you guys, too.

1818
01:14:10,476 --> 01:14:12,077
Why did you come here?

1819
01:14:12,079 --> 01:14:13,745
Because you're my brother,
and I can't just let you die,

1820
01:14:13,747 --> 01:14:17,349
even though
you might deserve it.

1821
01:14:17,351 --> 01:14:19,952
You're unbelievable,
you know that?

1822
01:14:19,954 --> 01:14:22,420
You've always been
a better person than me.

1823
01:14:22,422 --> 01:14:24,322
You gotta shut up. Okay?

1824
01:14:24,324 --> 01:14:27,225
Listen. I'm a fraud, Max.

1825
01:14:27,227 --> 01:14:30,027
I'm not the carefree dude that
wins at everything he touches.

1826
01:14:30,029 --> 01:14:31,130
You know how I win?

1827
01:14:31,132 --> 01:14:32,630
I cheat.
I cheat at everything.

1828
01:14:32,632 --> 01:14:34,868
I even cheated when we were
kids playing <i>Battleship.</i>

1829
01:14:36,637 --> 01:14:37,768
What?

1830
01:14:37,770 --> 01:14:39,904
Didn't you ever wonder
why I made you sit

1831
01:14:39,906 --> 01:14:41,238
with your back to the TV?

1832
01:14:41,240 --> 01:14:44,309
It was so I could see
your ships in the reflection.

1833
01:14:44,311 --> 01:14:47,846
I mean, I even took five grand
every time we played <i>Monopoly</i>

1834
01:14:47,848 --> 01:14:49,581
before we even
started playing the game.

1835
01:14:49,583 --> 01:14:53,085
I cheated at the <i>Game of Life.</i>
And at the game of life.

1836
01:14:53,087 --> 01:14:54,553
You son of a bitch.

1837
01:14:54,555 --> 01:14:57,855
- You son of a bitch!
- <i>Yo, sit down.</i>

1838
01:14:57,857 --> 01:14:59,890
- What about you, Princess?
- I don't have anything.

1839
01:14:59,892 --> 01:15:03,562
But it didn't stop there,
because when we grew up, Max,

1840
01:15:03,564 --> 01:15:06,598
you went off
to college, and I...

1841
01:15:06,600 --> 01:15:08,966
You got a career, you...

1842
01:15:08,968 --> 01:15:11,803
You married the greatest girl
in the world.

1843
01:15:11,805 --> 01:15:13,938
I knew I couldn't keep up
with that success.

1844
01:15:13,940 --> 01:15:15,707
So I...

1845
01:15:15,709 --> 01:15:18,009
I told everyone that I got
a job on Wall Street.

1846
01:15:18,011 --> 01:15:19,577
And I did.

1847
01:15:19,579 --> 01:15:22,350
Selling coke to traders.

1848
01:15:23,618 --> 01:15:25,317
You didn't invest in Panera?

1849
01:15:25,319 --> 01:15:26,885
I ate at Panera.

1850
01:15:26,887 --> 01:15:28,554
Jesus Christ.

1851
01:15:28,556 --> 01:15:30,054
What's going on?

1852
01:15:30,056 --> 01:15:31,924
But that's why I've been
trying to make it up to you.

1853
01:15:31,926 --> 01:15:33,558
That's what this whole
game night was about.

1854
01:15:33,560 --> 01:15:37,630
See, I had it rigged
so that you'd finally win.

1855
01:15:37,632 --> 01:15:40,631
The last clue
was gonna lead you...

1856
01:15:40,633 --> 01:15:42,102
Your jacket pocket.

1857
01:15:52,245 --> 01:15:53,480
Huh.

1858
01:15:55,449 --> 01:15:57,719
Surprise.

1859
01:16:00,753 --> 01:16:03,221
I even managed to fuck
that up, though. I'm so sorry.

1860
01:16:03,223 --> 01:16:07,326
I'm so sorry, Max.

1861
01:16:07,328 --> 01:16:09,560
I think we're gonna be okay,
though. I got a feeling.

1862
01:16:09,562 --> 01:16:10,931
You want us to kill them all?

1863
01:16:12,098 --> 01:16:13,465
- What?
- Okay.

1864
01:16:13,467 --> 01:16:14,566
<i>Wait, wait.
Just let us go.</i>

1865
01:16:14,568 --> 01:16:15,968
We won't tell anyone anything.

1866
01:16:15,970 --> 01:16:17,868
We got you the list!

1867
01:16:17,870 --> 01:16:20,607
- What the fuck, man?
- Fuck! God damn it!

1868
01:16:22,476 --> 01:16:23,541
- Oh, shit. The fuzz.
- Fuck, man!

1869
01:16:23,543 --> 01:16:25,077
Freeze!

1870
01:16:25,079 --> 01:16:25,978
<i>Gary?</i>

1871
01:16:25,980 --> 01:16:27,411
Don't even think
about it, pig.

1872
01:16:27,413 --> 01:16:29,380
Can't say I care
for that nomenclature.

1873
01:16:32,352 --> 01:16:33,654
Get down!

1874
01:16:34,421 --> 01:16:36,423
Come on, bitch!

1875
01:16:43,530 --> 01:16:45,031
God damn it!

1876
01:16:52,640 --> 01:16:54,605
Hey, isn't that your neighbor?

1877
01:16:54,607 --> 01:16:56,308
<i>When did Gary
get so cool?</i>

1878
01:16:56,310 --> 01:16:58,477
- Oh, my God!
- Everybody okay?

1879
01:16:58,479 --> 01:17:00,179
- You're cool-ass Gary.
- You all right?

1880
01:17:00,181 --> 01:17:02,380
Fine, thank you.

1881
01:17:02,382 --> 01:17:04,416
Though, in sliding,
my belt buckle

1882
01:17:04,418 --> 01:17:06,452
may have inadvertently
scratched

1883
01:17:06,454 --> 01:17:07,920
the finish of my squad car.

1884
01:17:07,922 --> 01:17:09,653
How did you know
we were in trouble?

1885
01:17:09,655 --> 01:17:12,491
The nocturnal <i>Jenga</i> game,

1886
01:17:12,493 --> 01:17:14,660
my blood-spattered
marital souvenirs,

1887
01:17:14,662 --> 01:17:18,796
and Max's curious search
history piqued my interest.

1888
01:17:18,798 --> 01:17:21,198
- Right. Oh, God.
- You, uh...

1889
01:17:21,200 --> 01:17:23,033
You saved our lives.

1890
01:17:23,035 --> 01:17:24,635
Thank you.

1891
01:17:24,637 --> 01:17:26,506
Just doing my job.

1892
01:17:27,641 --> 01:17:28,941
- <i>Oh, my God!</i>
- <i>Oh!</i>

1893
01:17:28,943 --> 01:17:31,012
- Shit!
- Oh, shit! Oh, shit!

1894
01:17:32,145 --> 01:17:34,313
Gary!

1895
01:17:34,315 --> 01:17:36,548
Hello? I need
an ambulance. Officer down.

1896
01:17:36,550 --> 01:17:37,782
- Oh, shit!
- Hang in there, pal.

1897
01:17:37,784 --> 01:17:39,416
<i>Hang on, hang on, pal.</i>

1898
01:17:39,418 --> 01:17:40,652
Hang on.
You're gonna be all right.

1899
01:17:40,654 --> 01:17:41,786
We're gonna
get you to a hospital.

1900
01:17:41,788 --> 01:17:43,421
Okay, look at me. Gary, look.

1901
01:17:43,423 --> 01:17:45,456
You have got
a lot to live for, okay?

1902
01:17:45,458 --> 01:17:46,691
Do I?

1903
01:17:46,693 --> 01:17:48,193
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah.

1904
01:17:48,195 --> 01:17:49,797
I have no wife.

1905
01:17:51,464 --> 01:17:53,264
- No friends.
- That's not true.

1906
01:17:53,266 --> 01:17:54,465
No, don't say that.

1907
01:17:54,467 --> 01:17:55,567
You got us.
We're your friends.

1908
01:17:55,569 --> 01:17:56,935
You've got us.

1909
01:17:56,937 --> 01:18:00,906
You don't even like
spending time with me.

1910
01:18:00,908 --> 01:18:02,240
Yes, we do.
We just...

1911
01:18:02,242 --> 01:18:04,175
We've been a little selfish,
that's all.

1912
01:18:04,177 --> 01:18:05,609
- Right, right.
- I'm sorry about that.

1913
01:18:05,611 --> 01:18:07,045
Oh, God. Oh, God.

1914
01:18:07,047 --> 01:18:10,014
- Bastian.
- Huh?

1915
01:18:10,016 --> 01:18:12,416
Someone please take care
of Bastian.

1916
01:18:12,418 --> 01:18:15,621
Gary, you are gonna take care
of Bastian yourself, okay?

1917
01:18:15,623 --> 01:18:17,255
Listen. As soon as you get out
of the hospital,

1918
01:18:17,257 --> 01:18:19,160
you're gonna come to every
single game night we have.

1919
01:18:20,494 --> 01:18:22,294
Don't...

1920
01:18:22,296 --> 01:18:23,362
Yeah?

1921
01:18:23,364 --> 01:18:25,529
Don't you

1922
01:18:25,531 --> 01:18:27,568
ever

1923
01:18:28,334 --> 01:18:30,268
exclude me again.

1924
01:18:30,270 --> 01:18:33,006
- Never exclude you again, pal.
- No.

1925
01:18:35,008 --> 01:18:37,443
- Oh, God. What is that?
- What's that?

1926
01:18:37,445 --> 01:18:39,844
Is that a blood clot?

1927
01:18:39,846 --> 01:18:41,979
It's a blood capsule.

1928
01:18:41,981 --> 01:18:44,683
- Huh?
- A blood capsule?

1929
01:18:44,685 --> 01:18:49,557
And that is how you do
a game night.

1930
01:18:52,193 --> 01:18:53,226
What?

1931
01:18:55,495 --> 01:18:57,095
I've duped you all.

1932
01:18:57,097 --> 01:18:58,897
Wha...

1933
01:18:58,899 --> 01:19:00,866
Hold on a second.
Are you telling me

1934
01:19:00,868 --> 01:19:02,300
that this whole thing
was a game?

1935
01:19:04,070 --> 01:19:06,138
What? What?

1936
01:19:06,140 --> 01:19:07,605
- They, they...
- Shit!

1937
01:19:07,607 --> 01:19:09,374
I'm sorry. They got up.
They got up.

1938
01:19:09,376 --> 01:19:11,143
When I learned you stopped
inviting me to your game nights,

1939
01:19:11,145 --> 01:19:13,911
I hijacked Brooks'
murder mystery party

1940
01:19:13,913 --> 01:19:16,413
and I staged a kidnapping
of my own.

1941
01:19:16,415 --> 01:19:17,816
You gotta be kidding me.

1942
01:19:17,818 --> 01:19:19,318
What better way
to prove my worth

1943
01:19:19,320 --> 01:19:20,719
as a game night participant?

1944
01:19:20,721 --> 01:19:22,920
Well, what about these dudes?
Are they actors?

1945
01:19:22,922 --> 01:19:25,157
Oh, no. They're...
They're felons.

1946
01:19:25,159 --> 01:19:26,291
Felons?

1947
01:19:26,293 --> 01:19:27,893
I was able to shave some
time off of their parole

1948
01:19:27,895 --> 01:19:30,661
in exchange for
this little side project.

1949
01:19:30,663 --> 01:19:32,730
- We square now?
- Thank you, gentlemen.

1950
01:19:32,732 --> 01:19:34,032
That lady hit me with the car.

1951
01:19:34,034 --> 01:19:35,901
Hey, what the hell kinda
psycho are you?

1952
01:19:35,903 --> 01:19:38,469
You put us through all this,
just for your own amusement?

1953
01:19:38,471 --> 01:19:42,240
No, no. Just the opposite.
For your amusement.

1954
01:19:42,242 --> 01:19:43,175
Did everyone have fun?

1955
01:19:43,177 --> 01:19:44,975
- No! No.
- Yeah. No.

1956
01:19:44,977 --> 01:19:47,880
- No fun! I got shot!
- By me!

1957
01:19:47,882 --> 01:19:49,413
I don't see
how that's possible.

1958
01:19:49,415 --> 01:19:50,749
My men were using blanks.

1959
01:19:50,751 --> 01:19:52,751
Well, that was my gun.
It was a real gun.

1960
01:19:52,753 --> 01:19:55,152
So, this whole thing,
the Faberge egg,

1961
01:19:55,154 --> 01:19:56,990
The Bulgarian.
That was you?

1962
01:19:58,592 --> 01:19:59,724
You've lost me.

1963
01:19:59,726 --> 01:20:02,094
The egg, the WITSEC list?

1964
01:20:02,096 --> 01:20:04,332
It's all you.
All part of your game?

1965
01:20:07,333 --> 01:20:10,167
This is a list of people in the
Federal Witness Protection program.

1966
01:20:10,169 --> 01:20:12,737
- How did you get this?
- From inside the egg.

1967
01:20:12,739 --> 01:20:13,837
Stop fucking with us.
It's over!

1968
01:20:13,839 --> 01:20:15,107
I'm not fudging with you.

1969
01:20:15,109 --> 01:20:16,977
I honestly have no idea
what...

1970
01:20:18,878 --> 01:20:22,080
Oh, boy. Yikes!

1971
01:20:22,082 --> 01:20:23,314
I mean, how stupid
do you think we are?

1972
01:20:23,316 --> 01:20:24,883
- Hey, Max...
- Gang, are we looking

1973
01:20:24,885 --> 01:20:27,051
at the big twist here?
He gets shot again!

1974
01:20:27,053 --> 01:20:28,687
And by who?
A couple of new characters

1975
01:20:28,689 --> 01:20:29,987
you introduce
at the last minute.

1976
01:20:29,989 --> 01:20:31,756
Dude, you've jumped the shark!

1977
01:20:31,758 --> 01:20:33,358
Do you go to the magic shop
to buy a bunch

1978
01:20:33,360 --> 01:20:35,395
- of these little bullets?
- No.

1979
01:20:37,530 --> 01:20:38,929
Hang on.

1980
01:20:38,931 --> 01:20:40,165
This is Officer Kingsbury.

1981
01:20:40,167 --> 01:20:41,700
We got a 10-00
on the 4th Street...

1982
01:20:45,137 --> 01:20:47,307
Which one of you
is Brooks Davis?

1983
01:20:50,177 --> 01:20:52,380
It's funny, you don't look
like an asshole.

1984
01:20:53,580 --> 01:20:56,113
Do I look like
as asshole to you?

1985
01:20:56,115 --> 01:20:57,447
No.

1986
01:20:57,449 --> 01:20:59,250
One of us has to be the
asshole in this transaction

1987
01:20:59,252 --> 01:21:01,051
because otherwise
I'd have my egg,

1988
01:21:01,053 --> 01:21:02,621
and you'd have your money.

1989
01:21:02,623 --> 01:21:05,826
But instead, we've wasted
our night tracking you down.

1990
01:21:07,092 --> 01:21:08,792
Now we're gonna
have to kill you.

1991
01:21:08,794 --> 01:21:10,996
- What? No, no, no, no.
- What?

1992
01:21:10,998 --> 01:21:12,464
Mr. Bulgarian, I'm assuming?

1993
01:21:12,466 --> 01:21:15,634
Hi, I'm Max.
I'm Brooks' brother.

1994
01:21:15,636 --> 01:21:17,768
And you know, look.
He screwed up.

1995
01:21:17,770 --> 01:21:19,203
- Right? You got greedy.
- Oh, yeah.

1996
01:21:19,205 --> 01:21:20,404
He admits it.

1997
01:21:20,406 --> 01:21:22,674
Good news is, though,
that we got your egg.

1998
01:21:22,676 --> 01:21:24,876
It is broken.
Uh, my screw-up.

1999
01:21:24,878 --> 01:21:27,813
But, um, I got the list.

2000
01:21:27,815 --> 01:21:29,413
Which I bet you've been after
this whole time.

2001
01:21:29,415 --> 01:21:30,648
What about this?

2002
01:21:30,650 --> 01:21:33,285
How about

2003
01:21:33,287 --> 01:21:34,819
you take this list

2004
01:21:34,821 --> 01:21:37,354
<i>for free, and we all go
our separate ways?</i>

2005
01:21:37,356 --> 01:21:38,990
Nobody gets hurt.

2006
01:21:38,992 --> 01:21:42,693
Uh, except the poor folks
on this list, I'm guessing.

2007
01:21:44,597 --> 01:21:45,800
Okay.

2008
01:21:46,266 --> 01:21:47,432
Okay?

2009
01:21:47,434 --> 01:21:49,634
Deal. Makes perfect sense.

2010
01:21:49,636 --> 01:21:51,769
No, no. You give him
that list, he's gonna kill me.

2011
01:21:51,771 --> 01:21:53,440
That's nonsense.

2012
01:21:56,342 --> 01:21:58,475
What the hell
is wrong with you?

2013
01:21:58,477 --> 01:21:59,943
I'm just trying to buy myself
some time.

2014
01:21:59,945 --> 01:22:01,545
<i>Not much.</i>

2015
01:22:01,547 --> 01:22:03,917
We're just gonna cut it out
of you on the jet. Take him.

2016
01:22:07,287 --> 01:22:09,086
Don't follow us, Max.
I'm serious!

2017
01:22:09,088 --> 01:22:11,391
I'm not worried about that.

2018
01:22:14,793 --> 01:22:16,327
You just letting them go?

2019
01:22:16,329 --> 01:22:18,662
Yeah, they've done
nothing wrong.

2020
01:22:18,664 --> 01:22:20,865
Only this one.

2021
01:22:20,867 --> 01:22:22,567
- Let's go.
- Don't follow us!

2022
01:22:22,569 --> 01:22:25,437
Gary! He's breathing.

2023
01:22:25,439 --> 01:22:26,804
You know, the only
private air terminal

2024
01:22:26,806 --> 01:22:27,871
around here is at Conway.

2025
01:22:27,873 --> 01:22:29,808
Yeah. How are we
gonna get there?

2026
01:22:29,810 --> 01:22:31,443
Brooks' house is not
that far from here.

2027
01:22:31,445 --> 01:22:32,747
But our car's not there.

2028
01:22:33,980 --> 01:22:35,315
Yeah, it is.

2029
01:22:44,925 --> 01:22:46,357
You know,
you don't have to do this

2030
01:22:46,359 --> 01:22:48,259
because I can just
poop it out.

2031
01:22:48,261 --> 01:22:50,562
We're not gonna go digging
through your feces.

2032
01:22:50,564 --> 01:22:51,929
That's disgusting!

2033
01:22:51,931 --> 01:22:54,032
Now, hold still
while I cut your stomach open.

2034
01:22:54,034 --> 01:22:55,503
No, no! No! Whoa!

2035
01:22:56,669 --> 01:22:58,071
What the hell?

2036
01:23:00,039 --> 01:23:01,907
- Is that...
- That's my brother.

2037
01:23:01,909 --> 01:23:03,608
Get us in the air.

2038
01:23:03,610 --> 01:23:04,845
Now!

2039
01:23:15,788 --> 01:23:17,023
- Hold on!
- Oh!

2040
01:23:20,360 --> 01:23:21,792
- You all right?
- Yeah, you?

2041
01:23:21,794 --> 01:23:22,997
- Yup, good.
- Okay.

2042
01:23:27,635 --> 01:23:29,233
Okay, okay. What's our plan?

2043
01:23:29,235 --> 01:23:31,870
I have one idea.
It's so crazy,

2044
01:23:31,872 --> 01:23:33,170
though, baby,
it just might work.

2045
01:23:33,172 --> 01:23:34,639
You're gonna crash the car
into the plane,

2046
01:23:34,641 --> 01:23:36,340
like Liam Neeson in <i>Taken 3?</i>

2047
01:23:36,342 --> 01:23:38,211
He did that in <i>Taken 3,</i> huh?

2048
01:23:42,347 --> 01:23:43,749
- All right, are you ready?
- Uh-huh.

2049
01:23:43,751 --> 01:23:45,418
Here we go!

2050
01:23:47,553 --> 01:23:49,155
Oh, my God!

2051
01:23:50,723 --> 01:23:52,924
Uh, you missed it.

2052
01:23:52,926 --> 01:23:54,261
Thanks, baby.

2053
01:23:59,097 --> 01:24:00,432
Brooks, we're coming!

2054
01:24:00,434 --> 01:24:02,035
Whoo!

2055
01:24:19,453 --> 01:24:23,257
Well, at least I got to
drive it for 10 minutes.

2056
01:24:25,325 --> 01:24:26,258
Oh, my God.

2057
01:24:26,260 --> 01:24:27,858
- We have to hide.
- Yeah.

2058
01:24:27,860 --> 01:24:29,027
Okay. Go.

2059
01:24:29,029 --> 01:24:32,196
Oh, shit! Shit!

2060
01:24:32,198 --> 01:24:34,501
Go, go, go! It's stuck.

2061
01:24:35,703 --> 01:24:36,971
Fuck!

2062
01:24:37,538 --> 01:24:39,073
God damn it!

2063
01:24:56,823 --> 01:24:58,188
Where you at, lady?

2064
01:24:58,190 --> 01:25:01,158
Come on, you little bitch.

2065
01:25:01,160 --> 01:25:04,395
I know you're back here
somewhere.

2066
01:25:04,397 --> 01:25:08,265
Let's end this shit.
I won't kill you. Come out!

2067
01:25:08,267 --> 01:25:10,301
<i>Come on,
get your ass out here!</i>

2068
01:25:10,303 --> 01:25:12,402
Turn on the belt!

2069
01:25:12,404 --> 01:25:13,971
- <i>I'm not gonna hurt you.</i>
- Look at the box!

2070
01:25:13,973 --> 01:25:16,774
- <i>Just come on out, let's talk!</i>
- Can you charade it to me?

2071
01:25:16,776 --> 01:25:19,077
Charades?

2072
01:25:19,079 --> 01:25:21,278
That's some
cute full-circle bullshit.

2073
01:25:21,280 --> 01:25:23,148
Here we go. Three words.

2074
01:25:23,150 --> 01:25:25,486
Come on, lady. Where are you?

2075
01:25:27,788 --> 01:25:28,953
Turn.

2076
01:25:28,955 --> 01:25:30,520
Turn, turn, turn. Turn.

2077
01:25:30,522 --> 01:25:31,590
On.

2078
01:25:31,592 --> 01:25:34,461
Turn on. Turn on what?
Turn on what?

2079
01:25:36,163 --> 01:25:38,261
Turn on belt?

2080
01:25:38,263 --> 01:25:41,101
Turn on belt!

2081
01:25:50,110 --> 01:25:52,513
Boy, that's a slow belt.

2082
01:26:02,989 --> 01:26:04,255
Hey!

2083
01:26:04,257 --> 01:26:07,559
- Okay.
- Oh, God! Annie!

2084
01:26:09,962 --> 01:26:11,362
Oh, boy, that was...

2085
01:26:11,364 --> 01:26:12,563
You saw what I was going for,
though, right?

2086
01:26:12,565 --> 01:26:14,265
Yeah, yeah.
But then did you see

2087
01:26:14,267 --> 01:26:15,901
when I hit him
with the fire extinguisher?

2088
01:26:15,903 --> 01:26:18,068
- I sure did. I sure did, yeah.
- That was cool, right? Yeah.

2089
01:26:18,070 --> 01:26:19,670
- Yeah.
- Great.

2090
01:26:19,672 --> 01:26:20,839
Do you want this?

2091
01:26:20,841 --> 01:26:22,974
I don't want you to have it,
Calamity Jane.

2092
01:26:22,976 --> 01:26:24,341
All right, look.

2093
01:26:24,343 --> 01:26:26,544
I think I saw a hatch
at the top of the plane.

2094
01:26:26,546 --> 01:26:28,312
Maybe I can get
the drop on him.

2095
01:26:28,314 --> 01:26:30,048
- "The drop?"
- Yup, yeah.

2096
01:26:30,050 --> 01:26:31,448
- Who are you?
- Why don't you go use the emergency phone?

2097
01:26:31,450 --> 01:26:32,483
<i>Call for help.
I'm gonna do the drop.</i>

2098
01:26:32,485 --> 01:26:34,719
Okay. You're not Liam Neeson!

2099
01:26:34,721 --> 01:26:37,091
- That hurts my feelings!
- I'm sorry!

2100
01:26:46,967 --> 01:26:48,702
That's enough of this shit.

2101
01:27:09,021 --> 01:27:10,223
Max!

2102
01:27:11,357 --> 01:27:12,890
I can't get the drop
on anyone tonight.

2103
01:27:12,892 --> 01:27:14,224
Put that little knife down!

2104
01:27:14,226 --> 01:27:16,126
Right now! That's it.

2105
01:27:16,128 --> 01:27:18,263
Ahh!

2106
01:27:18,265 --> 01:27:20,200
Right in my bullet hole.

2107
01:27:25,305 --> 01:27:27,307
Come on, come on, come on.

2108
01:27:30,843 --> 01:27:32,046
Shit!

2109
01:27:36,283 --> 01:27:37,484
Stop!

2110
01:27:38,851 --> 01:27:40,053
Drop it!

2111
01:27:41,788 --> 01:27:43,220
Wait, wait. Um...

2112
01:27:43,222 --> 01:27:46,493
You don't have to do this.
I have kids at home.

2113
01:27:47,293 --> 01:27:49,059
Not with that ass you don't.

2114
01:27:49,061 --> 01:27:50,827
Oh. Well...

2115
01:27:50,829 --> 01:27:52,330
Thank you.

2116
01:27:52,332 --> 01:27:53,697
You're welcome.

2117
01:27:55,569 --> 01:27:58,105
Shit!

2118
01:28:00,373 --> 01:28:02,741
Yes!

2119
01:28:02,743 --> 01:28:04,709
Oh, no, he died!

2120
01:28:35,208 --> 01:28:37,709
And that's how you get
the drop on someone!

2121
01:28:37,711 --> 01:28:38,811
Oh, my God!

2122
01:28:39,913 --> 01:28:41,312
Oh. Oh!

2123
01:28:41,314 --> 01:28:43,417
- I gotcha! I gotcha!
- This is high.

2124
01:28:44,883 --> 01:28:46,184
You're amazing.

2125
01:28:46,186 --> 01:28:47,684
- You can cut me loose now.
- Thank you!

2126
01:28:47,686 --> 01:28:48,719
Okay. Okay, okay.

2127
01:28:48,721 --> 01:28:50,721
- Uh...
- Yeah. In the bag.

2128
01:28:50,723 --> 01:28:52,122
- This? Okay.
- Look in the bag.

2129
01:28:52,124 --> 01:28:54,157
- That's right.
- Okay.

2130
01:28:54,159 --> 01:28:55,492
Oh! Thank you!

2131
01:28:55,494 --> 01:28:57,530
- Okay. You all right?
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

2132
01:29:01,066 --> 01:29:03,201
Whoa. Well, look at that.

2133
01:29:03,203 --> 01:29:04,568
You put a bungee cord
in your hand,

2134
01:29:04,570 --> 01:29:06,770
you go straight
to the pervy place, don't you?

2135
01:29:06,772 --> 01:29:10,274
Hey. You saved my life.
Thank you.

2136
01:29:10,276 --> 01:29:11,776
- You okay?
- Yeah, yeah.

2137
01:29:11,778 --> 01:29:14,379
I mean, I just saw a man die,
but I'm... I'm okay.

2138
01:29:15,582 --> 01:29:17,081
Is that a knife
in your bullet hole?

2139
01:29:17,083 --> 01:29:19,153
Uh-huh. Hey.
I wanna have a baby.

2140
01:29:19,852 --> 01:29:21,051
Uh, what?

2141
01:29:21,053 --> 01:29:22,487
I used to think
that I wanted Brooks' life,

2142
01:29:22,489 --> 01:29:24,220
but, you know,
turns out he was just...

2143
01:29:24,222 --> 01:29:25,724
You're a loser.
He's a loser.

2144
01:29:25,726 --> 01:29:26,590
Uh, guilty.

2145
01:29:26,592 --> 01:29:28,526
But us making a family?

2146
01:29:28,528 --> 01:29:31,895
That's not pellets.
That's the fruit.

2147
01:29:31,897 --> 01:29:33,798
That's fruit, it's fruit.

2148
01:29:33,800 --> 01:29:35,265
Wait. What's going on?

2149
01:29:35,267 --> 01:29:37,367
Plus, think about all the
dum-dums that have kids, right?

2150
01:29:37,369 --> 01:29:38,569
And think about
how much better

2151
01:29:38,571 --> 01:29:40,004
our kid is gonna be
than their kids.

2152
01:29:40,006 --> 01:29:42,240
It's gonna beat their kids
at everything.

2153
01:29:42,242 --> 01:29:43,640
It's taken you this long
to see that?

2154
01:29:43,642 --> 01:29:45,710
Our baby is gonna crush
every other baby.

2155
01:29:45,712 --> 01:29:47,711
I'm sorry, that's right. And
not in that peak-too-early,

2156
01:29:47,713 --> 01:29:49,147
you know,
kid actor kind of way.

2157
01:29:49,149 --> 01:29:50,581
Mmm-mmm. No.

2158
01:29:50,583 --> 01:29:52,316
We will parcel out
his or her gifts over time.

2159
01:29:52,318 --> 01:29:53,617
- Absolutely.
- Yes.

2160
01:29:53,619 --> 01:29:54,885
We gotta teach it Mandarin
right away.

2161
01:29:54,887 --> 01:29:56,019
'Cause China's the future.

2162
01:29:56,021 --> 01:29:57,221
- It sure is.
- Yeah.

2163
01:29:57,223 --> 01:29:59,193
- You're the future.
- Oh, my God.

2164
01:30:02,361 --> 01:30:03,596
Hmm?

2165
01:30:04,698 --> 01:30:07,267
And that concludes
my game night.

2166
01:30:08,034 --> 01:30:09,133
- What?
- What?

2167
01:30:09,135 --> 01:30:10,501
It went exactly as I planned.

2168
01:30:10,503 --> 01:30:13,537
You learned every lesson
that I wanted you to.

2169
01:30:13,539 --> 01:30:15,609
Trevor, you can get up now.

2170
01:30:20,579 --> 01:30:21,946
I'm just fucking with you.

2171
01:30:21,948 --> 01:30:23,380
But that would've been
really cool, right?

2172
01:30:23,382 --> 01:30:24,948
You're such a dick.

2173
01:30:34,628 --> 01:30:37,062
- Hey! Hey!
- Hey!

2174
01:30:37,064 --> 01:30:39,464
- Hey, hey!
- Hey!

2175
01:30:39,466 --> 01:30:40,764
Come on, come on.

2176
01:30:40,766 --> 01:30:42,533
Hey, thanks for letting me
host again, huh?

2177
01:30:42,535 --> 01:30:44,501
Well, it's not like
we had a choice, huh?

2178
01:30:44,503 --> 01:30:46,438
Only 36 months to go.

2179
01:30:46,440 --> 01:30:47,705
Oh, time will fly.

2180
01:30:47,707 --> 01:30:48,872
- Can I get you a beer?
- Uh, yeah.

2181
01:30:48,874 --> 01:30:50,742
- Come on!
- Hey, listen, Brooks.

2182
01:30:50,744 --> 01:30:53,643
I know you're probably feeling
pretty humbled by all of this.

2183
01:30:53,645 --> 01:30:55,412
But, honestly, I think
you're gonna come out

2184
01:30:55,414 --> 01:30:57,148
the other side
a much better man.

2185
01:30:57,150 --> 01:30:58,549
Oh! Hey, look.

2186
01:30:58,551 --> 01:30:59,983
I completely agree.

2187
01:30:59,985 --> 01:31:02,086
You remember the WITSEC list
that I swallowed?

2188
01:31:02,088 --> 01:31:03,455
- Sure.
- I pooped it out,

2189
01:31:03,457 --> 01:31:06,791
sold it for $3 million
on the black market.

2190
01:31:06,793 --> 01:31:09,160
- Are you serious?
- Pretty sweet, huh?

2191
01:31:09,162 --> 01:31:11,428
Brooks, everybody on that list
is gonna get killed.

2192
01:31:11,430 --> 01:31:12,830
Oh, no, Max,
I'm not a monster.

2193
01:31:12,832 --> 01:31:15,398
I tipped everyone off
that they were in danger.

2194
01:31:15,400 --> 01:31:17,867
For $20,000 apiece.

2195
01:31:17,869 --> 01:31:19,937
You're unbelievable.

2196
01:31:19,939 --> 01:31:21,005
Thank you. It's not like

2197
01:31:21,007 --> 01:31:22,438
I'm gonna live
in this dump forever.

2198
01:31:22,440 --> 01:31:23,674
As soon as
this cuff comes off,

2199
01:31:23,676 --> 01:31:24,742
I'm gonna buy that house
I was renting.

2200
01:31:24,744 --> 01:31:26,279
I'm moving in with Johanna.

2201
01:31:27,079 --> 01:31:28,212
There she is.

2202
01:31:28,214 --> 01:31:30,747
- Hey, Dr. Chin!
- Hey, Max.

2203
01:31:30,749 --> 01:31:32,316
- Let's play.
- Yeah.

2204
01:31:32,318 --> 01:31:33,951
Uh, <i>The Crying Game?</i>

2205
01:31:33,953 --> 01:31:35,620
Uh, <i>Boys Don't Cry?</i>

2206
01:31:35,622 --> 01:31:37,688
<i>Is that a tear?
Is that the actor?</i>

2207
01:31:37,690 --> 01:31:39,122
- <i>Mr. Potato Head.
- Are you drawing the actor?</i>

2208
01:31:39,124 --> 01:31:40,325
- <i>Cry-Baby?</i>
- Yes!

2209
01:31:40,327 --> 01:31:42,527
- Time!
- It was <i>The Green Mile.</i>

2210
01:31:42,529 --> 01:31:45,429
- What?
- How is that <i>The Green Mile?</i>

2211
01:31:45,431 --> 01:31:48,198
This is me
at the Regal Cinema crying

2212
01:31:48,200 --> 01:31:51,670
as I did through
much of the film.

2213
01:31:51,672 --> 01:31:53,170
How we supposed
to know that, Gary?

2214
01:31:53,172 --> 01:31:56,742
I assume everyone cried
during <i>The Green Mile.</i>

2215
01:31:57,577 --> 01:31:59,577
- So, who's next?
- I'll go.

2216
01:31:59,579 --> 01:32:01,144
- Yeah!
- Go, baby.

2217
01:32:01,146 --> 01:32:02,345
Nice try, Gary.

2218
01:32:02,347 --> 01:32:04,215
And go!

2219
01:32:04,217 --> 01:32:05,515
Uh...

2220
01:32:05,517 --> 01:32:07,184
- <i>It's a rock.</i>
- <i>A bean? A rock!</i>

2221
01:32:07,186 --> 01:32:08,719
- <i>A ball?</i>
- That's a...

2222
01:32:08,721 --> 01:32:10,087
- Burger. Is that <i>a burger?</i>
- <i>Football!</i>

2223
01:32:10,089 --> 01:32:11,456
No, oh, that's
a dinner roll, right?

2224
01:32:11,458 --> 01:32:12,724
- A bun!
- <i>Bread?</i>

2225
01:32:12,726 --> 01:32:14,258
Is it a bun?
Looks like a bun.

2226
01:32:14,260 --> 01:32:15,626
<i>French loaf?</i>

2227
01:32:15,628 --> 01:32:16,993
Is this a motion picture?

2228
01:32:16,995 --> 01:32:18,528
A bun is in a house.
On a train.

2229
01:32:18,530 --> 01:32:19,831
Are we supposed
to announce it?

2230
01:32:19,833 --> 01:32:20,898
- Microwave?
- It's being cooked.

2231
01:32:20,900 --> 01:32:22,367
It's in an oven.
Bun in the oven!

2232
01:32:22,369 --> 01:32:23,468
<i>Yes, yes, yes!</i>

2233
01:32:23,470 --> 01:32:25,835
Wait. What?

2234
01:32:25,837 --> 01:32:27,373
Yes.

2235
01:32:28,473 --> 01:32:29,874
You pregnant?

2236
01:32:29,876 --> 01:32:31,445
We did it.

2237
01:32:39,084 --> 01:32:41,652
Oh, my gosh!
They're having a baby!

2238
01:32:41,654 --> 01:32:43,557
They're having a baby!

2239
01:32:44,423 --> 01:32:46,424
Oh, my God!

2240
01:39:32,864 --> 01:39:34,197
How you doing?

2241
01:39:34,199 --> 01:39:36,133
- Hi.
- I'm Kenny.

2242
01:39:36,135 --> 01:39:37,934
Nice to meet you, Kenny.

2243
01:39:39,437 --> 01:39:42,005
Usually people cut me off
and say they know who I am.

2244
01:39:42,007 --> 01:39:43,107
Oh, yeah?

2245
01:39:43,109 --> 01:39:45,378
Yeah. I didn't
catch your name.

2246
01:39:45,979 --> 01:39:47,814
I'm Debbie.
