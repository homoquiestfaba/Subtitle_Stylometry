until it loses its power.
This is very...

701
00:56:38,495 --> 00:56:43,205
- Excuse me.
- This is very important.

702
00:56:43,333 --> 00:56:45,870
- Why it is important...
MAN: - Excuse me.

703
00:56:46,002 --> 00:56:50,781
...Is if you bring someone
out of a traumatic event,

704
00:56:50,907 --> 00:56:53,080

gone over the memory...

Excuse me. Excuse me.

708
00:57:01,751 --> 00:57:04,925
Some of this sounds
quite like hypnosis, is it not?

709

This is a process of
de-hypnotization, if you will.

728

- Good science by definition

- Mr. More, if I may,

is there something frightening to you
about The Cause's travels into the past?

- Yes.

And perhaps what we think
we know of this world

You travel down the river,

and you cannot see
around the bend can you?

But that does not mean
it is not there, does it?

I don't think Freddie's as committed
to The Cause as The Cause is to him.

1052
01:20:55,350 --> 01:20:58,559
When I told Freddie about
your unpublished work...

1053
01:21:00,522 --> 01:21:03,594
...his question to me was...

1054
01:21:03,725 --> 01:21:06,638
... "What is something like that worth?"

1055
01:21:09,164 --> 01:21:11,474

for some outside agency,

1057
01:21:16,838 --> 01:21:21,150

is perhaps the question.

he is here if he is past help?"

I wonder how he got here,
and what he's after.

1065
01:22:02,884 --> 01:22:06,559
Is it really all so easy
that he just came across us?

1066
01:22:06,688 --> 01:22:09,328
He's a drunk,
and he's dangerous.

1067
01:22:09,457 --> 01:22:12,563

if we continue to have him here.
