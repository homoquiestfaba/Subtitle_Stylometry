HE'S A
DOWN-ON-HIS-LUCK GUY.

HE'S HAD A LOT OF
 HARD BREAKS, OK?

234
00:09:13,318 --> 00:09:14,853
HE USED TO BE
IN THE SOFTWARE
BUSINESS,

235
00:09:14,886 --> 00:09:16,589
AND IT DIDN'T
REALLY PAN OUT.

236
00:09:16,622 --> 00:09:17,823
HE'S KIND OF
A FREE SPIRIT.

237
00:09:17,856 --> 00:09:19,758
HE'S NOT REALLY
 EMPLOYABLE.

238
00:09:19,791 --> 00:09:21,226
WHY ISN'T HE
EMPLOYABLE?

239
00:09:21,259 --> 00:09:23,095
UH, WELL, HE, UH,
GOT DIVORCED,

THE CUSTODY BATTLE,

AND HE TURNED
 TO THE BOTTLE.

00:12:52,504 --> 00:12:53,906
DO YOU REMEMBER
WHEN SHE WAS

352
00:12:53,939 --> 00:12:56,108
IN THAT MOVIE<i>
 SHORT CIRCUIT?</i>

353
00:12:56,141 --> 00:12:58,510
HEY, DON, DON, DON.
I FORGOT TO ASK YOU.

354
00:12:58,543 --> 00:13:01,180
YOU GOT A NAME?

355
00:13:01,213 --> 00:13:01,914
DON.

356
00:13:01,947 --> 00:13:03,248
NO, NO, I MEAN
LIKE A MAGIC NAME,

357
00:13:03,281 --> 00:13:07,585
LIKE DON THE MYSTERIOUS
OR SOMETHING.

358
00:13:07,619 --> 00:13:11,490
DON...

359
00:13:11,523 --> 00:13:12,591
DON.

360
00:13:12,624 --> 00:13:14,960
YEAH, OK.

361
00:13:15,927 --> 00:13:19,131
HEY, FELIX,
BEFORE I FORGET,

362
00:13:19,164 --> 00:13:21,533
THIS ONE
IS FROM FLETCHER.

363
00:13:21,566 --> 00:13:22,300
WHO?

364
00:13:22,334 --> 00:13:24,536
UH, FLETCHER.
HE WORKS WITH MILES,

365
00:13:24,569 --> 00:13:26,438
DARK HAIR, NICE GUY.

366
00:13:26,471 --> 00:13:28,874
OH, DARK HAIR,
NICE GUY. FLETCHER?

367
00:13:28,907 --> 00:13:29,842
RIGHT.

368
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:30,843
OH, YEAH, I GUESS.

369
00:13:30,876 --> 00:13:34,446
UH-OH. [IMITATING
BASEBALL CHARGE]

370
00:13:37,549 --> 00:13:39,518
Diane:
HERE, WANT ME
TO TAKE THAT?

371
00:13:39,551 --> 00:13:41,520
Travis: GET RID
OF THAT, PLEASE.

372
00:13:41,553 --> 00:13:45,189
WHOA.

373
00:13:45,223 --> 00:13:47,859
Guys: OHH!

374
00:13:47,893 --> 00:13:48,560
NICE.

375
00:13:48,593 --> 00:13:50,996
MY MAN'S
GOT A NEW LID.

376
00:13:51,029 --> 00:13:52,030
WOW, THAT'S GREAT.

377
00:13:52,064 --> 00:13:55,400
I'M SURE I'LL FIND
A PLACE IN MY CLOSET
FOR THIS.

378
00:13:55,433 --> 00:13:56,535
IN THE MEANTIME,
WHY DON'T YOU FIND

379
00:13:56,568 --> 00:13:57,636
A PLACE IN YOUR CLOSET
FOR IT,

380
00:13:57,669 --> 00:13:59,538
AND I WEAR IT
WHENEVER I COME OVER.

381
00:13:59,571 --> 00:14:03,175
HEY, GOOD IDEA.
IT'S ON HOLD.

382
00:14:04,943 --> 00:14:06,245
NICE TO MEET YOU.
I'M FELIX.

383
00:14:06,278 --> 00:14:08,580
OH, COME ON.
YOU MET HIM LIKE
A THOUSAND TIMES.

384
00:14:08,613 --> 00:14:09,615
WHY DO YOU
GOTTA BE A DICK?

385
00:14:09,648 --> 00:14:11,950
HAVE I MET YOU
A THOUSAND TIMES?

386
00:14:11,983 --> 00:14:14,987
I DON'T KNOW.

387
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:16,622
NO.

388
00:14:16,655 --> 00:14:18,589
NO,
NOT A THOUSAND.

389
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:21,894
SEE? A THOUSAND TIMES.

390
00:14:21,927 --> 00:14:25,430
LET'S PLAY
A GAME. MILES?

391
00:14:25,463 --> 00:14:27,031
MILES.

392
00:14:27,065 --> 00:14:28,033
MILES!

393
00:14:28,066 --> 00:14:28,901
Miles: WHAT?

394
00:14:28,934 --> 00:14:30,435
OH, SHIT.
STAY THERE!

395
00:14:30,468 --> 00:14:31,002
WHAT?!

396
00:14:31,035 --> 00:14:31,770
WE GOTTA
KEEP IT DOWN.

397
00:14:31,803 --> 00:14:34,072
THE BEDROOM DOOR
IS NOT SOUNDPROOF.

398
00:14:34,105 --> 00:14:36,375
OK, LET'S PICK
SOMEBODY.

399
00:14:36,408 --> 00:14:37,109
HOW ABOUT--

400
00:14:37,142 --> 00:14:38,677
MY MAN FELIX.
IT'S GOTTA BE HIM.

401
00:14:38,710 --> 00:14:40,979
IT'S HIS BIRTHDAY.
OK, I'LL GO GET MILES.

402
00:14:41,012 --> 00:14:42,915
IT'S GONNA
BE YOU, BUDDY.

403
00:14:42,948 --> 00:14:44,049
WE CHOSE A GUY,
AND HE ASKED
A QUESTION LIKE,

404
00:14:44,083 --> 00:14:45,550
FOR INSTANCE,
&quot;WHAT KIND OF CAR
WOULD THIS PERSON BE?&quot;

405
00:14:45,583 --> 00:14:47,419
YOU WOULD SAY,
LIKE, A MUSTANG.

406
00:14:47,452 --> 00:14:48,487
OR AN EDSEL.

407
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:52,891
Ally: OH, YEAH,
I'VE DONE THIS GAME.
ACTING CLASS.

408
00:14:53,725 --> 00:14:56,228
OK, TRAVIS...

409
00:14:56,261 --> 00:14:58,063
IF THIS PERSON WERE--

410
00:14:58,096 --> 00:14:59,031
Diane: TRAVIS?

411
00:14:59,064 --> 00:15:00,432
OH, JESUS. WHAT?

412
00:15:00,465 --> 00:15:02,534
COULD YOU COME HERE
A SECOND, PLEASE?

413
00:15:02,567 --> 00:15:04,503
WE'RE PLAYING
THE GAME.

414
00:15:04,536 --> 00:15:05,204
TRAVIS.

415
00:15:05,237 --> 00:15:08,107
JESUS. OK, I'LL
BE RIGHT BACK.

416
00:15:09,474 --> 00:15:11,710
OK. MS. SHEEDY.

417
00:15:11,743 --> 00:15:15,213
IF THIS PERSON WERE...

418
00:15:15,246 --> 00:15:20,085
A CAR, WHAT KIND
OF CAR WOULD THEY BE?

419
00:15:21,086 --> 00:15:23,021
A MUSTANG.

420
00:15:23,054 --> 00:15:25,023
INTERESTING.

421
00:15:25,056 --> 00:15:27,526
A MUSTANG.

422
00:15:28,059 --> 00:15:29,060
I KNOW
YOU LIKE FELIX.

423
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:29,995
YEAH,
FELIX IS THE MAN.

424
00:15:30,029 --> 00:15:31,730
YEAH, BUT DO YOU WANT
TO KNOW WHAT I THINK?

425
00:15:31,763 --> 00:15:34,266
I THINK THAT FELIX
NOT ONLY IS NOT THE MAN,

426
00:15:34,299 --> 00:15:37,169
BUT FELIX...DOESN'T
HAVE A PERSONALITY,

427
00:15:37,202 --> 00:15:39,738
AND BENEATH THE BANAL
EXTERIOR THAT HE HAS

428
00:15:39,771 --> 00:15:42,007
IS JUST AN ASSHOLE.

429
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:43,040
DIANE!

430
00:15:43,075 --> 00:15:45,010
THE ONLY REASON--
DON'T YOU PLAY
STUPID, TRAVIS.

431
00:15:45,043 --> 00:15:45,911
THE ONLY REASON
THAT THIS TURNED

432
00:15:45,944 --> 00:15:47,746
INTO A &quot;SORT OF&quot; BIRTHDAY
PARTY FOR FELIX

433
00:15:47,779 --> 00:15:49,982
IS THAT I WANTED
TO HAVE A DINNER PARTY.

434
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:50,915
YOU WANTED
 TO INVITE FELIX,

435
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:53,051
AND IT JUST SO HAPPENED
THAT THE EVENT FELL

436
00:15:53,084 --> 00:15:54,218
SOMEWHERE AROUND
HIS BIRTHDAY.

437
00:15:54,252 --> 00:15:57,656
THIS IS NOT AN EFFORT
THAT COMES DIRECTLY
FROM MY HEART.

438
00:15:57,689 --> 00:16:00,459
IF THIS PERSON
WERE A BODILY FUNCTION,

439
00:16:00,492 --> 00:16:03,428
WHAT KIND OF A BODILY
FUNCTION WOULD THEY BE?

440
00:16:03,461 --> 00:16:04,730
SHIT.

441
00:16:04,763 --> 00:16:05,764
IT'S SANDY.

442
00:16:05,797 --> 00:16:06,798
NO, IT'S NOT SANDY.

443
00:16:06,832 --> 00:16:11,169
OH, OK. I JUST THOUGHT
BECAUSE WE HAVE THIS THING.

444
00:16:11,202 --> 00:16:12,471
AHEM.

445
00:16:12,504 --> 00:16:15,640
MS. SHEEDY...

446
00:16:15,673 --> 00:16:18,510
YOU--YOU HAVE
GOT TO CALM DOWN.

447
00:16:18,543 --> 00:16:20,679
NO, NO, NO,
I WILL NOT CALM DOWN.

448
00:16:20,712 --> 00:16:22,646
I'VE GOT A ROOM
FULL OF HUNGRY PEOPLE
OUT THERE.

449
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:24,149
THEY'RE SNACKING
 ON PISTACHIOS.

450
00:16:24,182 --> 00:16:25,650
THAT'S NOT THE WAY
I WAS RAISED.

451
00:16:25,683 --> 00:16:27,085
AND I CAN SEE
BY YOUR EYES

452
00:16:27,118 --> 00:16:29,054
THAT WE CAN
ELIMINATE PHILIP.

453
00:16:29,087 --> 00:16:31,122
WELL, WHY DON'T
YOU TRY AND CATER
SOME OF THIS?

454
00:16:31,156 --> 00:16:34,258
I WANT THEM TO GO.
PLEASE, I WANT THEM
TO GO.

455
00:16:34,292 --> 00:16:35,360
OH, COME ON.

456
00:16:35,393 --> 00:16:38,063
IF YOU LOVE ME,
YOU'LL KILL THEM.

457
00:16:38,096 --> 00:16:41,233
I WANT 'EM TO DIE!

458
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:45,170
&quot;EVERYBODY FELIX.&quot;

459
00:16:45,203 --> 00:16:46,438
THAT'S HORRIBLE.

460
00:16:46,471 --> 00:16:50,475
I'VE GOT PEOPLE
OUT THERE OF MY CLASS.

461
00:16:50,508 --> 00:16:52,544
YOUR CLASS. DIANE--

462
00:16:52,577 --> 00:16:55,147
OH, MY GOD,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

463
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:55,747
WHAT?

464
00:16:55,781 --> 00:16:57,449
PUT THAT OUT.
PUT THAT--

465
00:16:57,482 --> 00:17:00,218
FOR CHRIST'S SAKE,
WOULD YOU PUT THAT OUT!

466
00:17:00,251 --> 00:17:01,386
EVERYBODY
IS SMOKING.

467
00:17:01,419 --> 00:17:04,489
WELL, YOU KNOW
THERE IS NO SMOKING
IN THIS HOUSE, TRAVIS,

468
00:17:04,521 --> 00:17:05,823
PLUS YOU QUIT.

469
00:17:05,857 --> 00:17:06,758
I DIDN'T QUIT. I--

470
00:17:06,791 --> 00:17:07,391
YOU KNOW WHAT,
THEY SHOULD
ALL JUST PUT OUT

471
00:17:07,425 --> 00:17:09,161
THEIR FUCKING
 CIGARETTES.

472
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:11,128
YEAH, RIGHT. ARE YOU
GONNA GO OUT THERE

473
00:17:11,162 --> 00:17:14,098
AND TELL ALLY SHEEDY
TO PUT OUT
HER CIGARETTE?

474
00:17:14,132 --> 00:17:15,534
OH, YES, I WILL.

475
00:17:14,132 --> 00:17:15,534
YEAH, RIGHT.

476
00:17:15,567 --> 00:17:18,136
OK, YOU
JUST WATCH ME.

477
00:17:18,169 --> 00:17:20,605
Miles:
OK, MS. SHEEDY,

478
00:17:20,637 --> 00:17:21,539
IF THIS PERSON
WERE A FAMOUS,

479
00:17:21,573 --> 00:17:24,409
NOT AS FAMOUS AS YOU,
BUT A FAMOUS PERSON--

480
00:17:24,442 --> 00:17:28,580
EXCUSE ME. ALLY
SHEEDY, WOULD YOU
PLEASE PUT THAT OUT?

481
00:17:28,613 --> 00:17:32,785
OH, OF COURSE.
I'M SORRY.

482
00:17:34,752 --> 00:17:37,222
HE'LL BE HERE
ANY MINUTE.

483
00:17:37,255 --> 00:17:39,324
I LIKE THE COFFEE
IN GERMANY.

484
00:17:39,357 --> 00:17:42,661
YEAH. IN THE GERMANY,
THEY KNOW HOW
TO GRIND BEANS.

485
00:17:42,694 --> 00:17:44,262
ITALY HAS
GOOD COFFEE, TOO,

486
00:17:44,295 --> 00:17:47,332
BUT IF YOU
DON'T KNOW HOW
TO GRIND THE BEANS,

487
00:17:47,365 --> 00:17:49,835
YOU KNOW...

488
00:17:49,868 --> 00:17:51,168
YEAH.

489
00:17:51,202 --> 00:17:52,637
WELL, THEN
IT'S ACIDIC.

490
00:17:52,670 --> 00:17:56,241
THE FOAM
RISES TO THE TOP
OF YOUR STOMACH,

491
00:17:56,274 --> 00:17:57,809
BECOMES GASEOUS.

492
00:17:57,842 --> 00:17:59,744
Felix: OH, DID I MISS
THE COFFEE BEAN STORY?

493
00:17:59,777 --> 00:18:03,882
OH, GODDAMN IT! GOD, DIANE,
YOU TELL THAT SO WELL.

494
00:18:03,915 --> 00:18:05,750
I LOVE THAT LITTLE
 TRIP TO EUROPE.

495
00:18:05,783 --> 00:18:06,884
OH, YOU KNOW, IT'S ALL
IN THE GRINDING, FELLAS,

496
00:18:06,918 --> 00:18:09,687
BECAUSE, YOU KNOW,
IF YOU CAN'T GRIND
THE BEANS RIGHT...

497
00:18:09,721 --> 00:18:11,823
YOU KNOW, DIANE,
EVERY TIME
YOU TELL THAT STORY,

498
00:18:11,856 --> 00:18:13,692
IT JUST SOUNDS MORE
AND MORE SPONTANEOUS.

499
00:18:13,725 --> 00:18:16,628
REALLY, IT'S
STARTING TO SOUND LIKE
REAL CONVERSATION TO ME.

500
00:18:16,661 --> 00:18:18,597
YOU PROMISE YOU'RE
GONNA TELL IT
AGAIN, DIANE?

501
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:21,834
WILL YOU PROMISE?
IT'S MY BIRTHDAY.

502
00:18:25,503 --> 00:18:27,472
WHAT ARE YOU
LOOKING AT?

503
00:18:27,505 --> 00:18:30,242
HAS EVERYONE
SEEN THE PICTURE
OF PHILIP'S KID?

504
00:18:30,275 --> 00:18:31,610
NO. PHIL,
YOU GOT A KID?

505
00:18:31,643 --> 00:18:32,744
Phil: NO,
I DON'T HAVE A KID.

506
00:18:32,777 --> 00:18:34,713
OH, YES, YES,
YOU DO.

507
00:18:34,746 --> 00:18:36,314
FOR ONLY NICKELS
A MONTH, TOO.

508
00:18:36,347 --> 00:18:39,785
IT'S, UH, IT'S
JOBEEN, ISN'T IT?

509
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:48,927
IF YOU ALL MUST
KNOW, I SUPPORT
A VENEZUELAN CHILD

510
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,295
THROUGH
THE INTERNATIONAL

511
00:18:50,328 --> 00:18:53,398
CHILDREN'S
ORGANIZATION.

512
00:18:53,431 --> 00:18:55,867
HIS NAME
ISN'T JOBEEN,

513
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:56,768
IT'S JOAQUIN.

514
00:18:56,801 --> 00:18:58,203
Travis:
THAT'S NICE, PHIL.

515
00:18:58,236 --> 00:18:59,671
YEAH, THAT'S
MARVELOUS.

516
00:18:59,704 --> 00:19:02,841
THANK YOU,
THANK YOU.

517
00:19:03,741 --> 00:19:05,777
THIS IS YOUR
SECOND KID NOW,
ISN'T IT, PHIL?

518
00:19:05,810 --> 00:19:07,611
NO, NO,
IT'S NOT.

519
00:19:07,645 --> 00:19:08,580
OH, YES, YES,
IT IS,

520
00:19:08,613 --> 00:19:10,448
BECAUSE
SOMETHING HAPPENED
TO THE OTHER KID.

521
00:19:10,481 --> 00:19:11,182
WHY DON'T YOU TELL
ALLY SHEEDY

522
00:19:11,215 --> 00:19:12,951
WHAT HAPPENED

00:55:27,656 --> 00:55:30,593
GAY AS
A HEART ATTACK.

1398
00:55:33,129 --> 00:55:35,632
HEY, HAPPY NEW YEAR.

1399
00:55:38,067 --> 00:55:39,135
BEFORE I START
AVOIDING YOU,

1400
00:55:39,168 --> 00:55:41,704
I THOUGHT
WE OUGHT TO SPEAK.

1401
00:55:41,737 --> 00:55:42,738
SURE.

1402
00:55:42,772 --> 00:55:44,073
OBVIOUSLY THERE'S
SOME UNFINISHED
BUSINESS HERE

1403
00:55:44,106 --> 00:55:45,575
BETWEEN THE 2 OF US.

1404
00:55:44,106 --> 00:55:45,575

WITH--WITH EVERYTHING.

1406
00:55:50,112 --> 00:55:50,713
HMM.

1407
00:55:50,746 --> 00:55:53,516
WELL,
HOW AMNESIAC OF YOU.

1408
00:55:53,549 --> 00:55:54,250
DO I KNOW YOU?

1409
00:55:54,283 --> 00:55:55,618
NOT YET.

1410
00:55:54,283 --> 00:55:55,618
WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING AT?

1411
00:55:55,651 --> 00:55:56,586
WELL, I'M SORRY, DARIEN,

1412
00:55:56,619 --> 00:56:01,858
BUT I CAN'T JUST PRETEND
LIKE NOTHING HAPPENED.

1413
00:56:01,891 --> 00:56:03,593
LOOK...

1414
00:56:03,626 --> 00:56:04,427
THE LAST TIME
YOU WERE HERE,

1415
00:56:04,460 --> 00:56:06,729
WE DID AND SAID
SOME THINGS THAT WE--

1416
00:56:06,762 --> 00:56:09,465
WELL, THAT MAYBE
SHOULD HAVE BEEN SAID.

1417
00:56:09,498 --> 00:56:12,001
I MEAN, YOU'VE MADE IT
NO SECRET OVER THE YEARS

1418
00:56:12,034 --> 00:56:13,736
ABOUT THE WAY
YOU FEEL ABOUT ME.

1419
00:56:13,769 --> 00:56:15,872
BUT I MUST ADMIT
IT WAS A BIT
OPPORTUNISTIC OF YOU

1420
00:56:15,905 --> 00:56:18,040
TO MAKE
THOSE FEELINGS CLEAR
SO CLOSE TO MY BREAK-UP.

1421
00:56:18,073 --> 00:56:19,308
I THINK YOU'RE
REMEMBERING IT--

1422
00:56:19,341 --> 00:56:22,845
AND UNSUSPECTING TRAVIS

WITH DRINKS,

1424

LIKE I SAID, DARIEN,

1427
00:56:31,754 --> 00:56:34,056
MAYBE IT WAS GOOD
TO FINALLY GET IT ALL OUT.

1428
00:56:34,089 --> 00:56:36,959
IT IS. IT'S GOOD
 TO FINALLY GET IT ALL OUT.

1429
00:56:36,992 --> 00:56:38,060
IT'S GOOD
TO GET IT ALL OUT

1430
00:56:38,093 --> 00:56:41,196
SO THAT I CAN
FINALLY TELL YOU...

1431
00:56:41,230 --> 00:56:46,135
THAT I AM SO FLATTERED,
BUT I'M MARRIED.

1432
00:56:46,168 --> 00:56:47,937

SEEM TO THINK OF YOU

1433
00:56:47,970 --> 00:56:53,676

YOU ARE GOING TO BE
A REAL LADY-KILLER

00:57:02,852 --> 00:57:05,855
OH, YES.
COME HERE. COME.

1438
00:57:05,888 --> 00:57:09,659
NOW, I WANT YOU
TO GO OUT THERE

1439
00:57:09,692 --> 00:57:12,028

1442
00:57:14,431 --> 00:57:19,135

[HOARSELY]
CAN I HAVE A SIP?

1451
00:58:14,890 --> 00:58:17,894

COULD HAVE SWORN
IT WAS COMPANY.

1463
00:58:37,179 --> 00:58:39,248
NO. I USED TO WORK
AT A RECORD COMPANY.

1464

WHEN I DROP
THIS BOMBSHELL ON YOU.

THAT, UH, DARIEN--

1482
00:59:15,317 --> 00:59:18,087
IF A YOUNG LADY WERE
TO MAKE HER INTENTIONS KNOWN,

1483
00:59:18,120 --> 00:59:21,591
DARIEN MIGHT NOT BE RECEPTIVE

I'VE KNOWN HE WAS GAY
EVER SINCE I MET HIM.

1495
00:59:50,152 --> 00:59:53,222
I DON'T TELL
A LOT OF PEOPLE
THIS, BUT...

1496
00:59:53,255 --> 00:59:55,625
I WAS IN LOVE
WITH A GAY MAN ONCE.

1497
00:59:55,658 --> 00:59:57,627
I MEAN, I KNEW IT
WOULDN'T WORK OUT,

1498

BUT--AND
I WASN'T TRYING
TO CHANGE HIM.

1499
01:00:00,029 --> 01:00:02,031
I WOULDN'T TRY
 TO CHANGE ANYBODY.

1500
01:00:02,064 --> 01:00:05,734
YOU KNOW,
WHO THEY ARE
IS THE BEST THEM.

1501
01:00:05,768 --> 01:00:07,637
YOU THOUGHT THAT
OUR MAN DARIEN WAS GAY?

1502
01:00:07,670 --> 01:00:08,571
I HAD AN IDEA.

1503
01:00:08,605 --> 01:00:11,374
NOW THAT HE SAID IT,
IT SEEMS TO MAKE SENSE.

1504
01:00:11,407 --> 01:00:14,710
WHAT WOULD GIVE YOU
THAT IDEA?

1505
01:00:14,743 --> 01:00:16,412
I DON'T KNOW.
THE WAY HE ACTS.

1506
01:00:16,445 --> 01:00:17,780
THE WAY HE DRESSES.

1507
01:00:17,813 --> 01:00:19,982
THE FEELING YOU GET
WHEN YOU'RE AROUND HIM.

1508
01:00:20,015 --> 01:00:20,982
I--I DON'T KNOW.

1509
01:00:21,016 --> 01:00:22,351
WHAT?!
THE WAY HE DRESSES?!

1510
01:00:22,384 --> 01:00:25,154

THAT WAY.

FIRST OF ALL,
IT'S NOT<i> REVERSE</i> RACISM

1520
01:00:38,801 --> 01:00:39,769
BECAUSE DARIEN'S GAY.

1521
01:00:39,802 --> 01:00:41,404
WELL, THEN
IT'S JUST RACISM.

1522
01:00:41,437 --> 01:00:42,738
IT HAS NOTHING TO DO
WITH RACE.

1523
01:00:42,771 --> 01:00:44,774
OK, IT'S NOT RACISM.
YOU'RE A HOMOPHOBE.

1524
