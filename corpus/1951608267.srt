00:00:22,395 --> 00:00:24,870
ROOM 6

2
00:00:26,656 --> 00:00:28,032
Where am I?

3
00:00:28,654 --> 00:00:30,077
What's happening?

4
00:00:34,143 --> 00:00:37,205
Hello? Can you hear me?

5
00:00:40,616 --> 00:00:41,759
I can't move.

6
00:00:43,234 --> 00:00:45,754
I can't move. Help me.

7
00:00:47,325 --> 00:00:51,424
Oh my God, I'm awake.
I can't move! Help me!

8
00:00:52,169 --> 00:00:54,164
Oh my God, what are they doing?
They have to hear me.

9
00:00:54,199 --> 00:00:56,200
They have to see I'm awake,
they have to!

10
00:00:58,147 --> 00:01:01,273
Oh God, I can't feel that,
I can't feel what he's doing!

11
00:01:07,394 --> 00:01:10,680
No! I'm awake! Please!
I'm awake! Don't!

12
00:01:11,298 --> 00:01:13,530
I'm awake! I'm awake!

13
00:01:13,565 --> 00:01:17,061
I have a pretension, they
have to know I'm wide awake!

14
00:01:22,841 --> 00:01:24,138
Thank you, nurse Holiday.

15
00:01:24,173 --> 00:01:27,849
No! I'm awake! Please!
I'm awake! Don't!

16
00:01:38,484 --> 00:01:41,493
No! I'm awake! Please!
I'm awake! Don't!

17
00:01:41,528 --> 00:01:43,445
I'm going to make the first incision.

18
00:01:51,722 --> 00:01:52,738
Thank God.

19
00:01:58,464 --> 00:01:59,653
Thank God.

20
00:02:07,462 --> 00:02:09,042
Oh my dear.

21
00:02:10,678 --> 00:02:12,587
We know you're awake.

22
00:02:20,981 --> 00:02:23,078
No. No!

23
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:39,137
You could wake the dead
with that scream.

24
00:02:40,655 --> 00:02:43,208
Maybe not the dead, but
definitely the neighbours.

25
00:02:43,243 --> 00:02:44,654
It was so real.

26
00:02:47,576 --> 00:02:49,670
Let me guess, you're in the hospital again?

27
00:02:51,203 --> 00:02:54,354
Yeah, something like that.

28
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:58,724
- No, no, come on, don't get up.
- All right, it's morning.

29
00:02:58,759 --> 00:03:02,136
It's not morning...
Oh, it is morning.

30
00:03:03,667 --> 00:03:06,535
- How cold?
- At six.

31
00:03:08,019 --> 00:03:09,782
Why not seven or eight?

32
00:03:12,853 --> 00:03:14,620
Why wake up here when
the morning is like this?

33
00:03:21,182 --> 00:03:22,311
How's your mood?

34
00:03:22,346 --> 00:03:24,201
Black as my coffee.

35
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:27,547
So, what sort of school is that?

36
00:03:28,451 --> 00:03:31,287
Class 2-C. Melissa Norman again.

37
00:03:31,322 --> 00:03:32,992
Still problems with her?

38
00:03:33,027 --> 00:03:35,015
That ex would have trouble
getting through to that girl.

39
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:37,897
- How about you?
- Ransick building.

40
00:03:37,932 --> 00:03:40,431
See we found something to dig.

41
00:03:41,442 --> 00:03:44,655
Listen, Ames. Remember I had something
I wanted to talk to you about?

42
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:47,247
Now that we're in our
new appartment and stuff...

43
00:03:48,131 --> 00:03:51,559
- Let's hurry up, I don't want be late at class.
- It's important.

44
00:03:52,169 --> 00:03:53,517
I'm listening.

45
00:03:57,620 --> 00:03:59,100
Real big stuff.

46
00:04:06,289 --> 00:04:09,158
- Like I told you last night we need to talk.
- We're talking.

47
00:04:09,193 --> 00:04:11,123
No, I'm talking, you're not even listening!

48
00:04:11,158 --> 00:04:12,441
Sure I am!

49
00:04:13,354 --> 00:04:15,402
Maybe this will get your attention.

50
00:04:16,604 --> 00:04:20,628
It's been four years.
Four great years.

51
00:04:20,663 --> 00:04:23,446
Well mostly great years,
we were arguing sometimes...

52
00:04:23,481 --> 00:04:29,448
Nick, I can't do this right now.
Can we talk about it tonight?

53
00:04:30,685 --> 00:04:32,746
God damn it, Ames!

54
00:04:38,779 --> 00:04:41,087
I'm asking you to marry me.

55
00:04:43,737 --> 00:04:44,882
You're serious?

56
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,617
Nick, I love you.

57
00:04:51,891 --> 00:04:54,754
I gotta go. Can we...

58
00:04:55,467 --> 00:04:57,799
Can we pick up where we left off tonight?

59
00:04:58,603 --> 00:05:00,828
Just meet me at school at three, okay?

60
00:05:06,341 --> 00:05:07,742
All right.

61
00:05:31,821 --> 00:05:35,090
So you know why I kept you here
during playtime, right Melissa?

62
00:05:38,207 --> 00:05:40,058
You're having that bad dreams again?

63
00:05:41,482 --> 00:05:46,042
- And these things are back?
- Monsters.

64
00:05:46,766 --> 00:05:48,891
Monsters, right.

65
00:05:50,278 --> 00:05:53,719
But only in your dreams,
only when you're asleep, right?

66
00:05:56,550 --> 00:05:58,257
Do you remember what I said?

67
00:05:59,343 --> 00:06:01,643
When you're dreaming,
where are you really?

68
00:06:01,678 --> 00:06:04,983
- Safe in bed.
- Safe in bed, right.

69
00:06:05,916 --> 00:06:07,783
So you just have to remember that.

70
00:06:09,579 --> 00:06:12,106
Do you have your bad dreams?

71
00:06:14,867 --> 00:06:15,930
Yeah.

72
00:06:15,965 --> 00:06:18,726
Did you ever wonder why
you're having bad dreams?

73
00:06:18,761 --> 00:06:21,712
Did you ever wonder what
you did to deserve them?

74
00:06:23,866 --> 00:06:27,127
Do you even know what
you did was so terrible?

75
00:06:30,074 --> 00:06:33,752
- Melissa, why did you just say that?
- Say what?

76
00:06:35,536 --> 00:06:39,821
Say that I did something... terrible.

77
00:06:39,856 --> 00:06:42,231
What are you talking
about, miss Roberts?

78
00:06:43,775 --> 00:06:49,116
- Can I go now?
- Yeah, of course.

79
00:06:51,983 --> 00:06:54,180
Melissa you know I'm just
trying to help you.

80
00:06:54,215 --> 00:06:57,163
With the dreams or anything else
that might be bothering you.

81
00:06:57,198 --> 00:06:58,376
Like what?

82
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:01,528
Excuse me, can I help you?

83
00:07:02,313 --> 00:07:04,806
I don't know, you seem to have
your hands full trying to help my girl.

84
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:09,457
You're Melissa's mother,
I'm sorry we haven't met yet.

85
00:07:09,492 --> 00:07:11,957
You've not been to any of
the parent-teacher meetings.

86
00:07:12,181 --> 00:07:13,458
So sue me, sweet cheeks.

87
00:07:14,689 --> 00:07:19,646
We were just talking about the
picture Melissa drew in class today.

88
00:07:19,681 --> 00:07:23,604
Oh yeah? Just don't go fill her head
full with that Dr. Phill and Oprah shit.

89
00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:25,206
The kid is weird enough as it is.

90
00:07:26,710 --> 00:07:28,669
I'm just trying to help.

91
00:07:32,415 --> 00:07:35,985
You can't help me.
You can't even help yourself.

92
00:07:36,651 --> 00:07:38,259
You're not strong enough.

93
00:07:38,294 --> 00:07:43,917
I wish you could. You're nice.
Not like the others.

94
00:07:45,421 --> 00:07:51,486
You heard her. But the last thing I need
is more hastle from social services.

95
00:08:14,581 --> 00:08:20,807
Hey. Sorry about this morning.
You just caught me a little off-guard.

96
00:08:21,603 --> 00:08:25,103
Yeah well, when I was coming
I was afraid you've run off.

97
00:08:25,138 --> 00:08:31,374
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Sometimes you can be a little closed off.

98
00:08:33,122 --> 00:08:36,453
Aren't you supposed to be trying
to be charming right now?

99
00:08:36,488 --> 00:08:39,535
I am charming.
Forget Prince Charming.

100
00:08:39,570 --> 00:08:41,629
I'm the King of Charming.

101
00:08:42,562 --> 00:08:44,191
I just don't get it, Ames.

102
00:08:45,548 --> 00:08:48,331
You love me.
I know you do.

103
00:08:49,029 --> 00:08:50,654
So why don't you wanna marry me?

104
00:08:51,556 --> 00:08:54,623
- I didn't say that!
- It has to do with your father, right?

105
00:08:56,275 --> 00:08:58,606
That it's not right
to walk you down the isle.

106
00:08:58,641 --> 00:09:01,742
- To give you away?
- This has nothing to do with him!

107
00:09:02,477 --> 00:09:06,668
Of course, one mention of your dad
and you're all closed off.

108
00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:08,742
What else is new?

109
00:09:08,777 --> 00:09:11,322
Nick, you know what, you don't know
what you're talking about, so just stop it.

110
00:09:15,266 --> 00:09:18,472
I'm sorry, I just love you so much.

111
00:09:56,459 --> 00:09:58,587
- I think my leg is broken.
- It's okay.

112
00:09:59,348 --> 00:10:00,879
It's okay, honey.

113
00:10:06,503 --> 00:10:07,867
Oh, it's stuck!

114
00:10:15,554 --> 00:10:19,454
Help us! Please!
Somebody help us!

115
00:10:23,028 --> 00:10:26,712
- Help! Somebody call 911!
- Please!

116
00:10:43,282 --> 00:10:45,455
It's okay. It's gonna be okay, baby.

117
00:11:05,431 --> 00:11:07,104
Thank you, thank you.

118
00:11:30,985 --> 00:11:35,492
Hey, I'm okay, but my boyfriend...
he can't move.

119
00:11:40,283 --> 00:11:41,866
Stay there. Right there.

120
00:11:43,516 --> 00:11:44,853
Where are you going?

121
00:11:47,424 --> 00:11:50,140
Stay there. What a hell
they think I'm gonna do?

122
00:11:50,175 --> 00:11:52,980
- Go for a fucking jog?
- It's okay, baby.

123
00:11:53,015 --> 00:11:55,573
We're gonna get you out of here,
we're gonna be all right.

124
00:11:56,992 --> 00:11:59,040
I wrecked another car, didn't I?

125
00:11:59,733 --> 00:12:02,472
Yes, you did.

126
00:12:11,583 --> 00:12:13,026
Does this hurt?

127
00:12:25,128 --> 00:12:26,237
We'll take you to the hospital now.

128
00:12:49,306 --> 00:12:51,825
- Wait!
- Amy.

129
00:12:53,612 --> 00:12:55,698
Sorry lady. You're not allowed
to ride in the ambulance.

130
00:12:55,733 --> 00:12:57,000
You gotta get to the
hospital on your own.

131
00:12:57,035 --> 00:12:58,204
What?

132
00:12:58,239 --> 00:13:00,053
These are the rules, I don't make them,
you don't break them.

133
00:13:01,822 --> 00:13:03,845
What hospital you're taking him to?

134
00:13:09,599 --> 00:13:11,501
I'll meet you at the hospital, okay?

135
00:13:52,810 --> 00:13:54,067
Where's Ames?

136
00:13:55,046 --> 00:13:56,745
She'll meet you at the hospital later.

137
00:13:59,949 --> 00:14:02,563
- What hospital we're going to?
- St. Rosemary's.

138
00:14:03,891 --> 00:14:07,669
- I never heard of it.
- They'll take good care of you.

139
00:14:08,828 --> 00:14:10,392
Ames hates hospitals.

140
00:14:12,742 --> 00:14:14,105
They come in nightmares.

141
00:14:14,971 --> 00:14:16,461
Ever since she was a little kid.

142
00:14:17,504 --> 00:14:19,738
- A lot of people don't like hospitals.
- Not like Ames.

143
00:14:24,413 --> 00:14:26,596
She's gonna have to go now though.

144
00:14:29,174 --> 00:14:29,941
We'll see.

145
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:33,977
I'm fine, I'm fine.
It's my sister.

146
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:50,429
Excuse me, how far is
the nearest hospital?

147
00:14:50,464 --> 00:14:52,303
- About ten blocks.
- Can you take me there please.

148
00:15:14,852 --> 00:15:15,991
Hey there, Norma.

149
00:15:17,485 --> 00:15:20,493
- What have you got for me, Francis?
- Nicholas Van Dyke.

150
00:15:24,104 --> 00:15:25,522
Leg is busted up pretty bad.

151
00:15:32,233 --> 00:15:37,035
Don't you worry, Mr. Van Dyke.
We're gonna take good care of you.

152
00:15:54,964 --> 00:15:59,815
- You're okay, lady?
- Yes, I'm fine. I just don't...

153
00:15:59,850 --> 00:16:03,033
- I don't like hospitals.
- Nobody does.

154
00:16:03,068 --> 00:16:06,273
Except them, hypocondocious types.

155
00:16:07,336 --> 00:16:10,119
- Hypohondriacs.
- Them too.

156
00:16:11,646 --> 00:16:13,961
I haven't been in the hospital
since I was 12 years old.

157
00:16:13,996 --> 00:16:18,067
You're lucky, my wife breaks a sweat
I gotta take her to the emergency room.

158
00:16:30,748 --> 00:16:32,252
It's all right, Mr. Van Dyke.

159
00:16:37,076 --> 00:16:38,907
You're in the hospital now.

160
00:16:43,713 --> 00:16:47,865
- Where's Amy?
- I'm sure she's on her way.

161
00:17:07,517 --> 00:17:10,650
Maybe I should go in with
you and hold your hand?

162
00:17:11,368 --> 00:17:12,390
No, I'll be fine.

163
00:17:12,425 --> 00:17:14,597
It's too bad, cause I was gonna
leave the meter running.

164
00:17:21,306 --> 00:17:24,186
- You have a good day now, Amy.
- Yeah, you too.

165
00:17:27,458 --> 00:17:31,214
How did you know my name?
I didn't tell you my name.

166
00:18:05,002 --> 00:18:06,623
And don't try to talk.

167
00:18:06,658 --> 00:18:09,067
We've given you some
medication for the pain.

168
00:18:41,701 --> 00:18:44,233
I'm here to see my boyfriend,
he was brought in a little while ago.

169
00:18:44,268 --> 00:18:45,839
Brought in, when?

170
00:18:46,936 --> 00:18:49,508
I'm not exactly sure,
within the hour?

171
00:18:50,419 --> 00:18:53,046
- What's his name?
- Nick Van Dyke.

172
00:18:55,639 --> 00:18:59,315
Sorry, there must be some mistake,
he's not here. It's been quiet.

173
00:18:59,970 --> 00:19:04,237
- Who told you he was brought here?
- I just assumed...

174
00:19:04,886 --> 00:19:07,456
Are you sure?
Nicholas Van Dyke.

175
00:19:07,491 --> 00:19:09,294
There was a car accident
a few blocks from here.

176
00:19:09,329 --> 00:19:12,450
He'd broke his leg and
ambulance took him away.

177
00:19:12,485 --> 00:19:14,440
They sure as hell didn't bring him here.

178
00:19:14,475 --> 00:19:16,657
We haven't had an
ambulance admission all day.

179
00:19:19,978 --> 00:19:21,016
Are you okay?

180
00:19:23,671 --> 00:19:25,188
Yeah, I'm fine.

181
00:19:25,844 --> 00:19:28,843
Do you know where they might have taken him
if they didn't bring him here?

182
00:19:31,344 --> 00:19:36,854
This is a list of all the hospitals in the area.
Maybe they brought him to one of them.

183
00:19:37,789 --> 00:19:39,374
And all the numbers are listed there too.

184
00:19:39,409 --> 00:19:43,119
Maybe you want to give them a call
before you waste any more of your time.

185
00:19:43,154 --> 00:19:47,017
- There's a payphone right behind you.
- Thanks.

186
00:19:53,948 --> 00:19:57,773
You know I think I'm just gonna
use the phone outside.

187
00:19:57,808 --> 00:20:00,185
Thank you for your help,
thanks so much.

188
00:20:06,263 --> 00:20:07,839
Come on, Amy.
Come on.

189
00:20:08,861 --> 00:20:10,973
Hold it together, it's just a hospital.

190
00:20:11,572 --> 00:20:15,736
- People get better, it's where they get saved.
- Lady, lady, are you okay?

191
00:20:17,005 --> 00:20:19,744
Oh my God, you were in the accident too.

192
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:22,403
Are you okay?

193
00:20:23,353 --> 00:20:25,744
I'm in better shape than my truck, yeah.

194
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:29,655
I'm Lucas, Lucas Dylan.
Everybody calls me Luke.

195
00:20:29,690 --> 00:20:32,724
Hey, I'm Amy.
I'm just so sorry.

196
00:20:32,759 --> 00:20:38,646
I don't have any insurance cards on me,
Nick takes care of all of that stuff.

197
00:20:38,681 --> 00:20:39,846
Don't worry too much about that.

198
00:20:39,881 --> 00:20:42,961
I get to a car wreck like every few months.

199
00:20:42,996 --> 00:20:45,492
Gives me an excuse to get a new one.
I get to town to assignments.

200
00:20:46,133 --> 00:20:48,391
I'm just trying to find my sister
who was in the truck with me.

201
00:20:49,149 --> 00:20:50,007
Is she okay?

202
00:20:50,602 --> 00:20:54,349
They got around, put her in an ambulance and
didn't tell me which hospital they took her to.

203
00:20:55,392 --> 00:20:57,888
The same thing happened
with Nick, my boyfriend.

204
00:20:58,571 --> 00:20:59,900
It's crazy, right?

205
00:21:00,657 --> 00:21:04,656
I just got in the cab and told him to take me
to the closest hospital, which was here.

206
00:21:04,691 --> 00:21:06,895
The same here. She was never even admitted.

207
00:21:06,930 --> 00:21:08,427
They must have taken them
to a different hospital,

208
00:21:08,462 --> 00:21:10,270
but I don't even know
where to start looking.

209
00:21:12,379 --> 00:21:16,521
Fantastic! We can take turns calling,
save us a little time.

210
00:21:16,556 --> 00:21:21,450
Absolutely, I could really use the company,
I'm still just rattled.

211
00:21:21,485 --> 00:21:26,353
- You're not in shock, are you?
- No... I don't know...

212
00:21:27,217 --> 00:21:31,371
- Maybe, I have a thing about hospitals.
- I loathe them myself.

213
00:21:31,406 --> 00:21:33,450
What do you think we start
looking at these numbers, Lucas?

214
00:21:33,485 --> 00:21:35,524
Absolutely.

215
00:21:47,983 --> 00:21:50,613
Lie back down.
You need your rest.

216
00:21:54,789 --> 00:21:55,737
Van Dyke.

217
00:21:58,312 --> 00:22:01,541
VAN DYKE.

218
00:22:02,848 --> 00:22:04,389
Yes, I'll hold.

219
00:22:10,473 --> 00:22:11,466
Are you sure?

220
00:22:12,035 --> 00:22:13,718
Or maybe you could check again please.

221
00:22:17,089 --> 00:22:21,539
I was in the car accident with him.
His leg was injured very badly.

222
00:22:21,574 --> 00:22:23,583
The ambulance came,
they took him out,

223
00:22:23,618 --> 00:22:26,444
they drove him away, they
wouldn't let me go with him.

224
00:22:26,479 --> 00:22:27,800
They said it was against the rules.

225
00:22:27,835 --> 00:22:31,316
I've checked every hospital in the area.

226
00:22:31,351 --> 00:22:33,714
And you're the last one on the list.

227
00:22:34,424 --> 00:22:36,070
It's like he disappeared.

228
00:22:36,751 --> 00:22:38,650
Can you please tell me
how that's possible?

229
00:22:38,685 --> 00:22:41,296
Is there anywhere else that they
could have taken him anywhere...

230
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:47,510
Well fuck you very much!

231
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:56,594
Excuse me.

232
00:22:59,636 --> 00:23:00,436
Leave him!

233
00:23:01,525 --> 00:23:03,379
He's with us now!

234
00:23:06,152 --> 00:23:06,892
Get away from her!

235
00:23:29,466 --> 00:23:30,964
Leave him!

236
00:23:36,772 --> 00:23:38,118
Look out, look out!

237
00:23:48,163 --> 00:23:50,212
Okay, that's not possible.

238
00:23:50,247 --> 00:23:52,330
That was one lucky dude, I'll say.

239
00:23:52,365 --> 00:23:57,037
Luck? That wasn't luck,
did you see his face?

240
00:24:01,365 --> 00:24:07,936
It wasn't human, it was...
It was something else.

241
00:24:07,971 --> 00:24:12,718
- Luke, I feel like I'm going crazy.
- No, it's okay, you're worried.

242
00:24:12,753 --> 00:24:14,381
You got a rough day.

243
00:24:14,416 --> 00:24:16,354
Anybody who's been through
what you've been through today...

244
00:24:16,389 --> 00:24:19,784
- No, I feel like I'm seeing things.
- You're not crazy.

245
00:24:19,819 --> 00:24:22,419
A few years ago I worked in
a hospital and it's not unusual

246
00:24:22,454 --> 00:24:26,236
for people to get a little more imaginative,

247
00:24:26,271 --> 00:24:28,679
shall we say after traumatic experience.

248
00:24:33,232 --> 00:24:39,606
- You were a doctor there?
- No, I was just an orderly. Sorry.

249
00:24:39,641 --> 00:24:41,898
Or nurse, as my friends used like a joke.

250
00:24:41,933 --> 00:24:43,853
But I do know that I'm right about this.

251
00:24:47,647 --> 00:24:50,103
Hey, do you want me to get
you back to your place?

252
00:24:50,138 --> 00:24:53,266
Which we get back safely?
What do you say?

253
00:24:54,034 --> 00:24:58,278
No, I'm okay.
I'll be fine.

254
00:25:00,262 --> 00:25:03,709
I'm just gonna get home
and wait until tomorrow.

255
00:25:04,650 --> 00:25:08,794
If I don't know where he is by tomorrow,
I'm gonna call the police.

256
00:25:08,829 --> 00:25:13,042
Okay, I'll keep looking tonight,
if I find them I'll call you.

257
00:25:13,077 --> 00:25:16,536
If not I hope you don't mind
if I go with you to the police.

258
00:25:16,571 --> 00:25:19,722
- Of couse, yeah.
- Either way they'll be fine.

259
00:25:20,488 --> 00:25:22,836
Go home. Get some sleep.

260
00:25:34,917 --> 00:25:38,394
Here we are, Nicholas.
Home sweet home.

261
00:26:05,449 --> 00:26:06,811
Who's the new blood, nurse?

262
00:26:07,730 --> 00:26:10,087
That's Nicholas, he had an accident earlier.

263
00:26:10,122 --> 00:26:11,992
Dr. Kent said he is on
the road to recovery.

264
00:26:12,027 --> 00:26:17,322
- It's faster with you looking after.
- Too kind, too kind Mr. Brolin.

265
00:26:24,772 --> 00:26:27,497
Oops, pardon me.

266
00:26:27,532 --> 00:26:30,727
- Just need a blood sample.
- But you guys already got some.

267
00:26:30,762 --> 00:26:32,097
Doesn't hurt to be sure.

268
00:26:32,132 --> 00:26:36,582
Always taking blood this lot, sometimes you
swear it is more of a hobby than a job.

269
00:26:36,617 --> 00:26:40,261
That's enough of that, Mr. McKendrick.
Don't make us put your back on sedation.

270
00:26:52,295 --> 00:26:56,669
- Shit, save something for me.
- Language, Mr. Van Dyke. Please.

271
00:26:57,713 --> 00:27:00,181
I'll be back later for your
sponge bath, Mr. Van Dyke.

272
00:27:01,182 --> 00:27:05,645
After all, cleanliness is next
to Godliness now isn't it?

273
00:27:16,825 --> 00:27:17,609
Hey!

274
00:27:19,991 --> 00:27:21,277
Hey!

275
00:27:22,850 --> 00:27:27,020
- Listen to me, you don't wanna be here.
- Quiet, Harrison!

276
00:27:29,863 --> 00:27:33,964
I don't know about you guys, but I'm kinda
looking forward to that sponge bath.

277
00:27:33,999 --> 00:27:38,562
No, no, this place ain't right.
Ask Jamie here.

278
00:27:38,597 --> 00:27:40,727
Something's wrong here.

279
00:27:43,327 --> 00:27:44,547
How long you've been here?

280
00:27:47,427 --> 00:27:49,710
I don't know, I can't remember.

281
00:27:52,926 --> 00:27:54,813
What you've been treated for?

282
00:27:57,373 --> 00:27:59,344
You don't know what you've been treated for?

283
00:28:19,207 --> 00:28:21,598
You were saying something, Mr. McKendrick?

284
00:28:21,633 --> 00:28:23,062
Nothing, nurse Holiday.

285
00:28:29,954 --> 00:28:31,031
Good night then.

286
00:28:31,962 --> 00:28:34,354
- Good night, nurse Holiday.
- Good night, nurse Holiday.

287
00:28:56,676 --> 00:28:59,003
You have one new message.

288
00:29:00,801 --> 00:29:03,115
This is Sarah Norman,
Melissa's mother.

289
00:29:03,150 --> 00:29:05,210
I guess I'm sorry to bother
you at home and all that,

290
00:29:05,245 --> 00:29:07,499
but Melissa's been saying
some things about you.

291
00:29:07,534 --> 00:29:10,396
She says she needs to see you
and that she can help you.

292
00:29:10,431 --> 00:29:13,077
I hope you know what
that means, cause I don't.

293
00:29:13,112 --> 00:29:18,228
Anyway I'm just passing on the message so the
little darling will leave me alone and go to sleep.

294
00:29:19,074 --> 00:29:21,603
Anyway, you know where we are.

295
00:29:21,638 --> 00:29:22,652
This is crazy.

296
00:30:24,491 --> 00:30:25,375
Hello?

297
00:30:26,837 --> 00:30:30,922
Is anyone there?
Harrison?

298
00:30:34,844 --> 00:30:35,919
James?

299
00:31:00,771 --> 00:31:02,041
Oh, God.

300
00:31:04,752 --> 00:31:07,085
It's okay, it's okay.

301
00:31:07,806 --> 00:31:09,772
This is just a bad dream, that's all.

302
00:31:10,681 --> 00:31:11,855
No need to wake up.

303
00:31:13,469 --> 00:31:14,790
Go back to sleep.

304
00:31:40,878 --> 00:31:43,227
Wakey wakey, rise and shiny.

305
00:31:44,323 --> 00:31:46,736
What happened to the guy
who was in that bed yesterday?

306
00:31:47,518 --> 00:31:50,630
He was discharged last night. All better.

307
00:31:50,665 --> 00:31:52,970
You discharge him in
the middle of the night?

308
00:31:53,005 --> 00:31:54,590
Yes, he was all better.

309
00:31:56,427 --> 00:31:57,519
Better from what?

310
00:31:57,554 --> 00:31:59,909
Time for another blood
sample, Mr. Van Dyke.

311
00:32:00,770 --> 00:32:03,720
But you guys took enough
yesterday's stock of blood bank.

312
00:32:03,755 --> 00:32:05,370
And today is another day.

313
00:32:05,405 --> 00:32:07,752
Don't argue. Does no good to argue.

314
00:32:11,341 --> 00:32:14,483
- House always wins, doesn't it?
- Don't argue, Mr. Brown.

315
00:32:14,518 --> 00:32:16,468
You know it does no good to argue.

316
00:32:22,886 --> 00:32:27,460
- Your turn, Mr. Van Dyke.
- Save something for me, will you?

317
00:32:27,495 --> 00:32:31,265
Very amusing, Mr. Van Dyke.

318
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:33,365
You're quite the merry prankster.

319
00:32:41,047 --> 00:32:44,480
What a hell is wrong with you?
Get your hands off of me!

320
00:32:53,095 --> 00:32:56,834
Excuse me, we'd like to
report two missing persons.

321
00:32:59,996 --> 00:33:02,102
One of them is named Nicholas Van Dyke.

322
00:33:02,810 --> 00:33:05,483
There was a car accident yesterday,
I was in there too.

323
00:33:05,518 --> 00:33:09,651
- But I wasn't hurt.
- Great. Good for you.

324
00:33:10,445 --> 00:33:12,585
And the ambulance came
and took him away.

325
00:33:14,506 --> 00:33:15,580
Excuse me.

326
00:33:16,275 --> 00:33:18,592
My sister and I were in the same accident.

327
00:33:18,627 --> 00:33:21,561
I luckily just walked away
with a few bruises, but...

328
00:33:21,596 --> 00:33:25,363
But your sister got hurt and the
ambulance came and took her away.

329
00:33:25,398 --> 00:33:28,889
Yeah, but they were different ambulances.

330
00:33:29,839 --> 00:33:34,790
Neither this young lady's boyfriend, nor my sister
were admitted to any local hospitals...

331
00:33:34,825 --> 00:33:37,353
So you think that they were kidnapped?

332
00:33:37,388 --> 00:33:39,671
Abducted. Something like that.

333
00:33:39,706 --> 00:33:40,905
You know what, we don't know that.

334
00:33:40,940 --> 00:33:44,995
You're just wasting police time, right?

335
00:33:45,898 --> 00:33:47,114
What's wrong with you people?

336
00:33:47,843 --> 00:33:49,195
I got nothing better to do here?

337
00:33:50,517 --> 00:33:53,983
You think I got some kind of
special overtime compensation

338
00:33:54,018 --> 00:33:57,294
for filling this bullshit rogue
ambulance stories? Is that it?

339
00:33:57,329 --> 00:33:59,155
Excuse me, two people are missing.

340
00:33:59,190 --> 00:34:02,029
There was a car accident and
the ambulance took them away,

341
00:34:02,064 --> 00:34:03,405
we have no idea where they are...

342
00:34:04,153 --> 00:34:06,945
We're not accusing anybody of anything,
we're not making this up.

343
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:09,530
We're just looking to get
some help please. Jesus!

344
00:34:11,755 --> 00:34:13,373
That was pretty convincive.

345
00:34:14,348 --> 00:34:17,762
Seriously, that was the best
I've seen yet. Bravo.

346
00:34:18,497 --> 00:34:19,999
Wait, let me guess.

347
00:34:20,034 --> 00:34:22,967
They told you they were taking
them to St. Rosemary's, right?

348
00:34:23,669 --> 00:34:26,424
They didn't tell us where they were taking them.
They didn't say.

349
00:34:26,459 --> 00:34:30,400
No? That's a twist.
That's a new one.

350
00:34:30,435 --> 00:34:32,855
Usually you people say they
were taken to St. Rosemary's.

351
00:34:32,890 --> 00:34:35,340
Hey I got an idea,
just for shits and giggles.

352
00:34:35,375 --> 00:34:37,182
Next time why don't you
drop big foot in there too.

353
00:34:37,217 --> 00:34:40,181
Okay, I'd like to speak to your
supervising officer right now.

354
00:34:40,216 --> 00:34:43,225
You know what, I want you back away
from my desk, right God damn now!

355
00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:45,988
Before I have you arrested for
wasting my time, you understand?

356
00:34:48,297 --> 00:34:49,925
Come on, she's just
being a bitch, let it go.

357
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:55,870
Leave him.

358
00:34:56,574 --> 00:34:58,278
He's with us now.

359
00:35:04,605 --> 00:35:05,366
What?

360
00:35:06,027 --> 00:35:07,799
What did you just say to me?

361
00:35:09,168 --> 00:35:10,400
Easy, easy, easy!

362
00:35:10,435 --> 00:35:12,573
- Did you see her face?
- Okay, you know what?

363
00:35:12,608 --> 00:35:15,911
I got a nice cosy little cell
all ready and waiting for you.

364
00:35:15,946 --> 00:35:17,975
That's where you wanna play.

365
00:35:18,010 --> 00:35:19,771
You'll make some nice
new friends back there.

366
00:35:19,806 --> 00:35:22,463
We're very sorry, we're just upset. Thank you.

367
00:35:22,498 --> 00:35:24,357
Thank you very much for your time, thank you.

368
00:35:24,392 --> 00:35:25,687
Yeah, okay.

369
00:35:29,587 --> 00:35:33,462
You didn't see her face, you
didn't hear anything she said?

370
00:35:33,497 --> 00:35:34,855
No, nothing.

371
00:35:42,988 --> 00:35:46,173
We have to make them understand!
To take us seriously!

372
00:35:46,208 --> 00:35:48,078
That's not really gonna work,
you just saw what happened.

373
00:35:48,113 --> 00:35:49,569
They'll think we point some
kind of practical joke,

374
00:35:49,604 --> 00:35:51,355
although honestly
I'm not quite sure why.

375
00:35:51,390 --> 00:35:53,438
You know what, what
are we supposed to do?

376
00:35:54,155 --> 00:35:59,426
Nothing? Just sit around, waiting for Nick and
your sister to come back safe and sound?

377
00:36:00,410 --> 00:36:04,058
They will call. Just as soon as they can they'll
tell us what hospital they were taken to.

378
00:36:04,093 --> 00:36:06,319
We'll go visit them,
everything will be fine.

379
00:36:06,354 --> 00:36:09,234
Amy, we just have to be patient.

380
00:36:09,269 --> 00:36:10,357
I can't do that!

381
00:36:10,538 --> 00:36:12,670
Well, we don't really
have choice now, do we?

382
00:36:14,730 --> 00:36:15,917
I'm sure this is a mix-up.

383
00:36:17,213 --> 00:36:19,999
They were admitted under
different names, files were lost.

384
00:36:20,034 --> 00:36:21,714
That probably happens all the time.

385
00:36:23,124 --> 00:36:27,265
Hasn't it occured to you that maybe they were
too badly hurt to give their names?

386
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:31,840
You know that maybe they had a relapse
on the way to the hospital,

387
00:36:31,875 --> 00:36:36,020
and they're lying in a coma or...
- Stop, stop, don't even say it.

388
00:36:37,446 --> 00:36:42,232
You've thought the same thing.
You're just as scared as I am.

389
00:36:43,031 --> 00:36:46,891
Yes, I mean...
I don't know, Amy.

390
00:36:46,926 --> 00:36:49,473
I choose to believe that they're fine.

391
00:36:51,260 --> 00:36:54,289
This is all one big mix-up.
That's all.

392
00:36:55,826 --> 00:37:00,008
She's gonna call, she's gonna want me
to bring her flowers and chocolates.

393
00:37:02,121 --> 00:37:03,004
Come here.

394
00:37:07,633 --> 00:37:08,656
Caradeli,

395
00:37:10,229 --> 00:37:13,403
that's her favourite chocolates, that's
what she's gonna want me to bring her.

396
00:37:14,344 --> 00:37:15,762
You're probably right.

397
00:37:26,931 --> 00:37:28,009
Asshole.

398
00:37:34,552 --> 00:37:38,044
I'm gonna go. Home, cause
that's the number Nick will call.

399
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:43,466
- I'll call you later, okay?
- You promise?

400
00:37:43,501 --> 00:37:48,286
Yeah, I just have to stop somewhere,
but I'll talk to you tonight, okay?

401
00:38:03,370 --> 00:38:04,608
It won't do any good, you know.

402
00:38:05,804 --> 00:38:06,789
They'll never come.

403
00:38:07,867 --> 00:38:11,270
You can call as many times as you like,
but they'll never come.

404
00:38:18,626 --> 00:38:21,270
Hey. What are you doing?

405
00:38:22,856 --> 00:38:24,550
Don't let them see you're doing that.

406
00:38:26,655 --> 00:38:32,018
Oh no, go back to bed,
stay here. Please.

407
00:38:32,053 --> 00:38:34,212
I'm gonna call Amy,
let her know I'm all right.

408
00:38:34,943 --> 00:38:37,760
And after that I'm gonna call my lawyer.

409
00:38:38,534 --> 00:38:40,703
File them, practice on
these sons of bitches.

410
00:40:30,375 --> 00:40:31,833
What are you doing out of bed?

411
00:40:33,827 --> 00:40:37,205
- I need a bathroom.
- You were given a bed pack.

412
00:40:41,046 --> 00:40:42,630
I saw something in there.

413
00:40:43,498 --> 00:40:46,880
It's just a supply closet, Mr. Van Dyke.
Nothing of interest to you in there.

414
00:40:48,144 --> 00:40:49,528
Open that door.

415
00:41:03,306 --> 00:41:06,117
- That's impossible!
- Now that's enough, Mr. Van Dyke.

416
00:41:06,152 --> 00:41:08,657
I'll have to insist that
you return to your bed.

417
00:41:08,692 --> 00:41:12,008
You're in no fit state to be
wondering around by yourself.

418
00:41:15,724 --> 00:41:18,615
You're on powerful drugs for the pain.

419
00:41:19,348 --> 00:41:23,157
But an occasional side effect can be
hallucinations, that's all it is.

420
00:41:23,192 --> 00:41:25,145
I suggest you remember that.

421
00:41:26,646 --> 00:41:28,300
It's something wrong with this place.

422
00:41:28,335 --> 00:41:31,090
There's nothing wrong with
this place, Mr. Van Dyke.

423
00:41:31,125 --> 00:41:32,984
It's a fine hospital for finest.

424
00:41:33,019 --> 00:41:35,928
You don't wanna pay attention
to these wild stories.

425
00:41:36,569 --> 00:41:37,803
What stories?

426
00:41:38,574 --> 00:41:40,732
You know perfectly well what stories.

427
00:41:40,767 --> 00:41:43,897
Full of lies. Vicious lies and scandal.

428
00:41:51,556 --> 00:41:54,582
I'm going to ask Dr. Kent
to prescribe you something.

429
00:41:56,635 --> 00:41:59,280
Something to stop these episodes.

430
00:42:17,929 --> 00:42:20,678
What is she talking about, James?
What stories?

431
00:42:22,815 --> 00:42:24,644
I'm talking to you, what stories?

432
00:42:47,199 --> 00:42:49,402
You have one new message.

433
00:42:51,358 --> 00:42:54,588
Hi, Ames. I guess me being at the
hospital has you pretty freaked out.

434
00:42:55,866 --> 00:42:58,316
I'll tell you the truth
I'm freaked out here myself.

435
00:42:59,527 --> 00:43:00,416
Where are you?

436
00:43:04,126 --> 00:43:05,538
Why haven't you visited me?

437
00:43:06,281 --> 00:43:09,815
But if you scared I understand,
but I need you badly.

438
00:43:10,638 --> 00:43:15,305
I need you. Things are weird here.

439
00:43:15,340 --> 00:43:19,517
I don't know, first it's taking blood.

440
00:43:21,442 --> 00:43:24,412
I'm scared, I'm so really scared.

441
00:43:25,257 --> 00:43:28,034
Things aren't right here,
patients going missing.

442
00:43:28,069 --> 00:43:30,624
Discharged maybe, I don't know. Maybe not.

443
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:33,662
Ames, I gotta go.

444
00:43:37,139 --> 00:43:39,444
Mr. Van Dyke, what
you're doing out there!

445
00:43:40,274 --> 00:43:42,066
Put that phone down.

446
00:43:51,301 --> 00:43:52,844
You can't save him.

447
00:43:55,051 --> 00:43:56,550
He's with us now.

448
00:44:07,171 --> 00:44:08,984
Who the hell are you,
what do you want?

449
00:44:09,019 --> 00:44:12,629
- Is this Amy Roberts?
- Yes, who is this?

450
00:44:12,664 --> 00:44:14,873
This is Sarah Norman,
Melissa's mother.

451
00:44:14,908 --> 00:44:18,687
I called you and left you a message, I guess
you just didn't feel to need to call me back.

452
00:44:18,722 --> 00:44:20,824
You fear some white trash mom
wasn't worth your time.

453
00:44:21,525 --> 00:44:23,859
Sorry, it's been a rough couple of days.

454
00:44:23,894 --> 00:44:25,914
I don't care none about your sad tales,

455
00:44:25,949 --> 00:44:28,638
you need to get your skinny
white ass over here right now.

456
00:44:28,673 --> 00:44:31,796
Melissa's been saying some weird shit
and it's all your fault.

457
00:44:31,831 --> 00:44:34,709
- She won't eat, she won't sleep.
- What, what is she saying?

458
00:44:34,744 --> 00:44:37,384
She's been saying
she can help you find him.

459
00:44:37,419 --> 00:44:40,505
Now I don't know what that mean, maybe
I'm giving her too much sugar or something,

460
00:44:40,540 --> 00:44:43,791
but she keeps saying that over and over again.
Does this mean anything to you, sweet cheeks?

461
00:44:44,701 --> 00:44:45,930
I'm on my way.

462
00:45:04,077 --> 00:45:05,115
So I'm here.

463
00:45:06,026 --> 00:45:09,005
Don't make it selling charity.
This is all your fault.

464
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:11,320
Please, I really need Melissa's help.

465
00:45:33,727 --> 00:45:37,460
This here is Bob. This is a little
brat's teacher from school.

466
00:45:38,425 --> 00:45:39,831
Oh, that's nice.

467
00:45:39,866 --> 00:45:42,960
Don't you get up or nothing,
you rude bastard?

468
00:45:42,995 --> 00:45:44,300
Please Sarah.

469
00:45:46,749 --> 00:45:50,115
- Hi.
- Hi.

470
00:45:51,975 --> 00:45:53,656
A little one won't shut her trap,

471
00:45:53,691 --> 00:45:57,170
being there yelling all day about meaning
to talk to you about something.

472
00:45:57,205 --> 00:45:59,766
And I don't know what you're
teaching in their school...

473
00:46:00,484 --> 00:46:04,379
Maybe you should start with manners.
Like respect your parents and shit.

474
00:46:05,131 --> 00:46:08,836
- You ain't no parent, Bob.
- Yeah, not to Marcella.

475
00:46:09,532 --> 00:46:10,961
It's Melissa.

476
00:46:11,582 --> 00:46:14,196
Yeah, I bet you dollars and donats
that I got a little girl

477
00:46:14,231 --> 00:46:17,056
flowing around out there somewhere
in this great nation of ours.

478
00:46:17,091 --> 00:46:19,030
I bet you do.

479
00:46:19,824 --> 00:46:22,334
Miss Roberts, Bob may
not be much on the ice,

480
00:46:22,369 --> 00:46:24,476
but he does have a way
about him, won't you say?

481
00:46:26,834 --> 00:46:28,144
Leave him.

482
00:46:29,615 --> 00:46:32,569
You cannot help him.
We won't let you.

483
00:46:35,309 --> 00:46:36,485
Are you all right, honey?

484
00:46:42,581 --> 00:46:45,636
Maybe I should go talk to
Melissa now, if that's okay.

485
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:50,233
Now you do that if you need us,
we'll be right out here.

486
00:46:50,268 --> 00:46:51,814
Right, sugar britches?

487
00:46:51,849 --> 00:46:54,213
Stop that asshole, we've got company.

488
00:47:12,804 --> 00:47:19,549
- Melissa? You're awake?
- You're here.

489
00:47:19,584 --> 00:47:22,135
Your mom called, she said
you needed to talk to me.

490
00:47:23,048 --> 00:47:24,504
You wanted to talk to me.

491
00:47:24,539 --> 00:47:26,919
You know the monsters
are real now, don't you?

492
00:47:29,876 --> 00:47:32,704
Sometimes I think I see them,
but I'm not sure.

493
00:47:32,739 --> 00:47:36,244
You can't find him.
You don't know where he is.

494
00:47:36,965 --> 00:47:41,024
No. No, I don't.
Do you?

495
00:47:41,764 --> 00:47:44,310
- Yes.
- Where?

496
00:48:04,337 --> 00:48:07,896
- Sweety, where is he?
- St. Rosemary's.

497
00:48:08,709 --> 00:48:12,640
St. Rosemary's...
I've heard that name before.

498
00:48:12,675 --> 00:48:15,038
You can find him if you really want.

499
00:48:25,403 --> 00:48:28,536
You've never told anybody why
you're so very afraid of hospitals.

500
00:48:34,511 --> 00:48:37,536
I did something terrible
once some long time ago.

501
00:48:40,234 --> 00:48:43,912
I never talked about it.
I never told anyone.

502
00:48:45,487 --> 00:48:48,807
Before this is over,
I think you should.

503
00:49:02,802 --> 00:49:04,782
Time for your pills, Mr. Van Dyke.

504
00:49:11,476 --> 00:49:14,516
- What are they for?
- To help you sleep of course.

505
00:49:25,228 --> 00:49:26,298
Very good.

506
00:50:03,111 --> 00:50:04,500
What's the matter, my child?

507
00:50:08,841 --> 00:50:10,261
I don't know how to say this.

508
00:50:11,718 --> 00:50:13,257
I feel like I'm going crazy.

509
00:50:15,479 --> 00:50:17,607
Well, you can stay here
as long as you need to.

510
00:50:18,634 --> 00:50:20,769
And I hope you'll find
the peace you're looking for.

511
00:50:21,671 --> 00:50:22,739
Thank you.

512
00:50:25,028 --> 00:50:27,717
- Hey, Father.
- Yes, child.

513
00:50:30,292 --> 00:50:35,411
I know I haven't been righteous in a long time,
I mean not since my father...

514
00:50:37,424 --> 00:50:39,597
Not since I was a little girl.

515
00:50:41,336 --> 00:50:45,823
I'm just so scared and I'm confused.

516
00:50:45,858 --> 00:50:48,263
And I don't understand
what's happening to me.

517
00:51:14,841 --> 00:51:15,767
Amy.

518
00:51:53,193 --> 00:51:55,015
Are you all right, child?

519
00:52:03,308 --> 00:52:04,578
No.

520
00:52:04,613 --> 00:52:09,083
Please, if you'd like, I can get you
into a rehab program we run here.

521
00:52:09,118 --> 00:52:15,259
- It could prove very helpful for you.
- No, you can't help me.

522
00:52:16,780 --> 00:52:18,362
Only I can.

523
00:52:26,370 --> 00:52:28,392
Hey, thanks for coming.

524
00:52:29,046 --> 00:52:31,279
- You're okay?
- Yeah, I will be.

525
00:52:31,314 --> 00:52:35,870
- I need you to listen for a minute.
- Yeah. Sure. Whatever you need.

526
00:52:35,905 --> 00:52:38,196
- What do you want?
- A research.

527
00:52:38,231 --> 00:52:42,698
- What are we researching?
- St. Rosemary's hospital.

528
00:52:42,733 --> 00:52:47,958
- May I ask why?
- A ten year old girl told me I should.

529
00:52:47,993 --> 00:52:49,178
Okay, it makes sense.

530
00:52:49,213 --> 00:52:51,726
Excuse me, can you tell me
where street section is?

531
00:52:51,761 --> 00:52:54,122
- Upstairs, on the right.
- Great, thanks.

532
00:52:56,537 --> 00:52:58,345
You're welcome, Amy.

533
00:53:40,947 --> 00:53:47,523
Hello? We're looking for any information
you might have about St. Rosemary's hospital.

534
00:53:48,711 --> 00:53:53,602
My dear, why would you want to read
about that dreadful place?

535
00:53:55,307 --> 00:53:59,978
It's a long story.
What do you know?

536
00:54:00,758 --> 00:54:02,227
Just the usual.

537
00:54:03,124 --> 00:54:05,469
The place was destroyed years ago.

538
00:54:05,504 --> 00:54:08,558
Many years ago, before you were born.

539
00:54:10,104 --> 00:54:14,332
Raised to the ground in a
terrible fire they started.

540
00:54:16,245 --> 00:54:17,791
Who is they?

541
00:54:20,380 --> 00:54:27,379
The doctors, the nurses, the orderlies.

542
00:54:34,450 --> 00:54:38,003
The entire staff started it some said.

543
00:54:45,793 --> 00:54:49,539
- Why did they do it?
- Nobody knows for sure.

544
00:54:50,303 --> 00:54:57,342
It was for something so terrible, they all chose
to stay and die in the fire rather than escape.

545
00:54:59,436 --> 00:55:04,916
Back then there were rumors.
Stories, back from before the fire.

546
00:55:04,951 --> 00:55:08,710
Tales of sacrifices, devil worship.

547
00:55:08,745 --> 00:55:12,565
Patients that would vanish
and never be seen again.

548
00:55:13,568 --> 00:55:17,737
Blood rituals to preserve eternal youth.

549
00:55:17,772 --> 00:55:25,336
And the rumor spread that in one night
the whole building went up in flames.

550
00:55:25,371 --> 00:55:29,332
- And nobody got out alive.
- Nobody?

551
00:55:30,165 --> 00:55:36,131
People came to see and told
how they could see into the fire.

552
00:55:36,166 --> 00:55:39,817
And have nobody even tried to escape.

553
00:55:39,852 --> 00:55:44,985
That they just sat down and waited to die.

554
00:55:45,020 --> 00:55:48,634
Waited for the flames to take them.

555
00:55:48,669 --> 00:55:53,696
A terrible cursed place.
Thankfully gone now forever.

556
00:55:58,399 --> 00:55:59,769
I have to get home.

557
00:56:02,067 --> 00:56:05,134
Wait! Please wait!

558
00:56:07,471 --> 00:56:12,837
My cats don't wait to get hungry.
So I don't wait to feed them.

559
00:56:27,483 --> 00:56:28,588
What is it?

560
00:56:31,468 --> 00:56:36,286
- I've seen these people before.
- They've been dead like 60-70 years.

561
00:56:36,321 --> 00:56:41,735
- You couldn't have.
- I've seen them in my dreams.

562
00:57:26,102 --> 00:57:28,668
Thanks again for taking me home, Lucas.

563
00:57:29,593 --> 00:57:31,895
I'm still a little bit freaked.

564
00:57:35,266 --> 00:57:36,664
What are you doing?
Where are you going?

565
00:57:36,699 --> 00:57:38,804
I'm gonna head back to
the hotel and check out.

566
00:57:38,839 --> 00:57:41,389
I should probably head back south.

567
00:57:42,529 --> 00:57:47,561
- You can't! What about your sister?
- I don't really have a choice.

568
00:57:50,647 --> 00:57:53,896
Okay you know what, just stay here.

569
00:57:53,931 --> 00:57:59,177
I'm gonna take a shower and we'll order food,
and sit down and discuss this, okay?

570
00:58:00,524 --> 00:58:01,941
Whatever you say, boss.

571
00:58:24,766 --> 00:58:27,554
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to.

572
00:58:28,127 --> 00:58:30,955
You were screaming.
I'm sorry.

573
00:58:49,106 --> 00:58:53,053
So I think I know where Nick and your sister are,
but I don't think you're gonna believe me.

574
00:58:53,088 --> 00:58:54,396
Where?

575
00:58:55,469 --> 00:58:57,596
St. Rosemary's hospital.

576
00:58:59,854 --> 00:59:02,489
They can't be.
It burned down, remember?

577
00:59:02,524 --> 00:59:04,399
Yeah, I know. I don't know how they're there.

578
00:59:06,241 --> 00:59:08,590
I know that they are and
that they need our help.

579
00:59:09,238 --> 00:59:16,295
- You love him very much.
- Yeah, I do.

580
00:59:17,211 --> 00:59:21,149
My whole life I've dreamed of meeting
someone who'd love me that much.

581
00:59:22,475 --> 00:59:27,254
You're so special. So special,
I knew it the first time we met.

582
00:59:29,585 --> 00:59:38,009
And beautiful. When I saw you standing
there in your bathroom. Naked.

583
00:59:38,044 --> 00:59:41,330
I didn't just wanna come for you,
I wanted to hold you in my arms.

584
00:59:41,365 --> 00:59:43,950
I wanted to caress your breasts,
I wanted to be inside of you.

585
00:59:43,985 --> 00:59:44,885
Lucas.

586
00:59:44,920 --> 00:59:48,444
Cause you're even more beautiful
on the inside than you are on the outside.

587
00:59:49,202 --> 00:59:51,236
Lucas, what are you doing?

588
00:59:51,271 --> 00:59:54,610
What I wanted to do since
the second I laid eyes on you.

589
01:00:00,591 --> 01:00:03,801
Lucas, I'm sorry I can't.
I can't do this.

590
01:00:03,836 --> 01:00:07,821
Yes, you can. Shh.
Just close your eyes and forget.

591
01:00:07,856 --> 01:00:11,925
Lucas, I can't. Nick.

592
01:00:12,650 --> 01:00:16,444
Okay, I won't do anything. I promice.

593
01:00:17,168 --> 01:00:19,142
Just close your eyes.

594
01:00:19,177 --> 01:00:22,775
Lucas, I'm... I'm sorry, I love Nick.

595
01:00:23,489 --> 01:00:25,776
You just, you have to understand that.

596
01:00:26,585 --> 01:00:28,453
Nick is gone.

597
01:00:33,181 --> 01:00:35,763
- What?
- He's gone.

598
01:00:36,600 --> 01:00:39,247
Well, you can't help him.
Lost forever.

599
01:00:40,015 --> 01:00:41,120
And you can't help him.

600
01:00:45,010 --> 01:00:49,660
You're too afraid to help him.
He's gone. Leave him.

601
01:00:50,618 --> 01:00:52,265
He's with us now.

602
01:00:55,561 --> 01:00:58,495
After what happened to your dad,
you know you can't help him.

603
01:02:35,594 --> 01:02:39,069
You're only 12 years old, but you remember it
like it was yesterday, don't you?

604
01:02:40,133 --> 01:02:43,089
You'll never forget that day.
I know I won't.

605
01:02:44,022 --> 01:02:47,859
The look on your daddy's face,
the pain in your daddy's eyes.

606
01:02:49,524 --> 01:02:53,201
And that terrible thing you did.
How could you forget?

607
01:02:54,059 --> 01:02:55,876
I promise you, he hasn't either.

608
01:03:00,848 --> 01:03:06,193
- Do you remember the way he was before?
- No! Just leave me alone!

609
01:03:06,228 --> 01:03:09,918
The way he picked you up?
Swing you around?

610
01:03:09,953 --> 01:03:11,957
Let you ride on his shoulders,
take you to the park.

611
01:03:11,992 --> 01:03:18,299
And then his face. And its smell.
It's a smell of death.

612
01:03:23,828 --> 01:03:25,748
You remember what you did, Amy.

613
01:03:26,858 --> 01:03:29,273
To your own father,
you remember what you did.

614
01:03:30,142 --> 01:03:32,089
- I had no choice!
- Yes, you did.

615
01:03:33,423 --> 01:03:36,464
- And you chose to become one of us.
- No, I didn't.

616
01:03:38,644 --> 01:03:39,821
You're one of us, Amy.

617
01:03:40,758 --> 01:03:44,523
- Why can't you just admit it to yourself?
- Leave me alone!

618
01:03:57,478 --> 01:03:59,062
Ah, that hurt.

619
01:04:44,751 --> 01:04:50,308
- Hello again, lady.
- Go.

620
01:04:50,343 --> 01:04:54,007
- Go? Where do you wanna go?
- St. Rosemary's hospital.

621
01:04:54,983 --> 01:04:58,025
St. Rosemary's.
I thought you'd never ask.

622
01:04:59,187 --> 01:05:00,554
You're sure that's
where you wanna go, doll?

623
01:05:00,589 --> 01:05:03,251
- Yes.
- Okay.

624
01:05:03,286 --> 01:05:06,710
Next stop, St. Rosemary's.

625
01:05:36,591 --> 01:05:38,340
What's happened in here?

626
01:05:56,051 --> 01:05:57,756
Oh, dear nurse.

627
01:05:59,215 --> 01:06:03,237
Yes, what a pity, Dr. Kent.
Obviously delusional...

628
01:06:03,272 --> 01:06:06,633
Quite. I think we don't have
a choice, nurse Holiday.

629
01:06:07,612 --> 01:06:11,614
- Yes doctor, there really is only one choice.
- We're going to have to operate.

630
01:06:17,481 --> 01:06:18,326
We're here.

631
01:06:25,740 --> 01:06:28,122
- It doesn't look like it.
- Just wait.

632
01:06:33,879 --> 01:06:36,174
I can take you back home if you want.

633
01:06:37,726 --> 01:06:38,822
No.

634
01:06:40,229 --> 01:06:41,645
You can leave him if you want.

635
01:06:43,057 --> 01:06:44,117
No.

636
01:06:45,078 --> 01:06:48,515
If you go in there, you
may not come back out.

637
01:06:50,330 --> 01:06:56,284
I don't care. I'd rather live inside there
with Nick than live out here without him.

638
01:06:59,152 --> 01:07:01,359
Wait, that little girl wanted
me to ask you something.

639
01:07:03,783 --> 01:07:04,978
Melissa Norman?

640
01:07:06,103 --> 01:07:08,271
Yeah, if that's a name
you've got for her, sure.

641
01:07:09,091 --> 01:07:12,569
She wanted me to ask you why
you are so spooked about hospitals.

642
01:07:14,500 --> 01:07:21,173
When I was 12 my father went to
the hospital for a routine operation.

643
01:07:22,273 --> 01:07:25,991
Something went wrong
with the anaesthetic. And...

644
01:07:28,849 --> 01:07:33,911
He was hurt. He suffered brain damage.
He was crippled.

645
01:07:37,005 --> 01:07:39,511
Nothing like the father I loved so much.

646
01:07:41,845 --> 01:07:46,990
- So what happened after?
- Something terrible.

647
01:08:14,129 --> 01:08:18,150
Where am I?
What's happening?

648
01:08:19,981 --> 01:08:23,233
Hello? Hello?
Can you hear me?

649
01:08:25,030 --> 01:08:26,611
I can't move.

650
01:08:27,691 --> 01:08:30,918
I can't move. Help me.

651
01:08:31,722 --> 01:08:35,863
Oh my God, I'm awake.
I should be out there.

652
01:08:35,898 --> 01:08:37,443
I can't move.

653
01:08:38,278 --> 01:08:43,945
Oh God, I can feel that.
I can feel what they're doing.

654
01:09:38,406 --> 01:09:44,001
Oh no, I have to get their attention.
They have to know that I'm awake.

655
01:09:44,036 --> 01:09:45,714
They have to know.

656
01:09:51,187 --> 01:09:52,690
Thank you, nurse Holiday.

657
01:09:54,894 --> 01:09:56,352
I'm awake!

658
01:11:32,446 --> 01:11:35,387
Help us! Please let us go!

659
01:11:37,993 --> 01:11:39,462
Please help us!

660
01:11:40,758 --> 01:11:43,662
- Please open this door!
- I'm looking for Nickolas Van Dyke.

661
01:11:43,697 --> 01:11:45,459
Open this door and
we'll take you to him.

662
01:11:45,494 --> 01:11:46,507
He's in surgery.

663
01:11:47,279 --> 01:11:49,761
If I let you out,
you'll take me to him, right?

664
01:11:49,796 --> 01:11:51,514
Yes, of course we will.

665
01:12:16,633 --> 01:12:21,368
- You got blood on your hands too!
- Only you can't feel it yet!

666
01:13:23,787 --> 01:13:25,514
Come on!

667
01:14:55,246 --> 01:14:55,950
Amy?

668
01:14:59,853 --> 01:15:01,097
Daddy?

669
01:15:04,573 --> 01:15:07,199
- Amy.
- Daddy is that you?

670
01:15:13,638 --> 01:15:15,263
Amy, it's me.

671
01:15:21,825 --> 01:15:23,164
ROOM 6

672
01:15:39,565 --> 01:15:44,299
- Daddy!
- Hello, Amy. I've missed you so much.

673
01:15:44,334 --> 01:15:46,605
I've missed you too.

674
01:15:56,995 --> 01:16:02,095
- Don't be afraid, it's over now.
- I was so afraid.

675
01:16:02,892 --> 01:16:06,326
It's over, we can go home now.
I'll protect you. It's over.

676
01:16:06,361 --> 01:16:07,967
No, with Nick.

677
01:16:09,587 --> 01:16:12,091
I said you're coming home with me.

678
01:16:14,544 --> 01:16:16,273
No, I have to help Nick!

679
01:16:20,077 --> 01:16:21,875
How could you let this happen, Amy?

680
01:16:26,804 --> 01:16:31,148
- Look at me, you like that?
- It was an accident.

681
01:16:31,183 --> 01:16:34,796
Yeah, an accident.
You did this.

682
01:16:34,831 --> 01:16:37,062
You did this to me.

683
01:16:53,065 --> 01:16:57,796
Amy, come over to see daddy.

684
01:17:01,777 --> 01:17:03,186
Closer.

685
01:17:11,258 --> 01:17:13,482
Oh God, Ames!

686
01:17:15,143 --> 01:17:17,861
It really hurts, it really hurts me.

687
01:17:19,550 --> 01:17:22,826
- Daddy?
- Ames, listen to me.

688
01:17:24,593 --> 01:17:28,494
I want you do something for daddy.
Only you can do it.

689
01:17:30,112 --> 01:17:32,742
Ames, baby. I'm not coming home.

690
01:17:38,280 --> 01:17:40,028
It don't even let me sleep.

691
01:17:41,867 --> 01:17:45,290
We're never gonna
play again like before.

692
01:17:46,242 --> 01:17:50,970
I'm trapped here Ames. I'm stuck.
This machine won't let me go.

693
01:17:51,005 --> 01:17:55,879
How can you grow up
and go to college, marry

694
01:17:55,914 --> 01:17:59,161
with me tearing you at this hospital.

695
01:17:59,196 --> 01:18:00,883
You'll be crippled too.

696
01:18:01,782 --> 01:18:03,283
I want you to do this thing for me.

697
01:18:05,141 --> 01:18:07,432
I want you to set me free, Ames.

698
01:18:07,467 --> 01:18:10,669
- You'll die.
- I'm already dead!

699
01:18:11,549 --> 01:18:14,457
It's not living, it's not a life.

700
01:18:15,185 --> 01:18:17,095
Not for a man like me.

701
01:18:19,106 --> 01:18:21,505
They can't help me.
Nobody can help me.

702
01:18:21,540 --> 01:18:26,240
Only you. You can do this for me, Ames.

703
01:18:26,275 --> 01:18:29,312
I'm begging you to do it for me. For us.

704
01:18:31,017 --> 01:18:31,993
Do it, Ames.

705
01:18:33,808 --> 01:18:37,351
Don't do it, don't do it,
please, don't make me do it.

706
01:18:37,386 --> 01:18:40,114
Yes, do it.

707
01:18:41,487 --> 01:18:43,728
No, don't do it,
don't do it.

708
01:18:43,763 --> 01:18:45,375
Yes Ames, yes.

709
01:18:51,966 --> 01:18:53,621
Daddy! Daddy!

710
01:18:53,656 --> 01:18:58,266
Daddy! Daddy! Help!

711
01:19:05,482 --> 01:19:06,986
Daddy!

712
01:19:22,931 --> 01:19:24,413
Amy!

713
01:19:31,898 --> 01:19:33,105
Come back!

714
01:19:43,450 --> 01:19:44,909
You belong here.

715
01:19:56,197 --> 01:19:57,277
You belong with us.

716
01:20:06,954 --> 01:20:09,598
- I don't belong here.
- Yes, you do.

717
01:20:09,633 --> 01:20:11,347
His blood is on your hands.

718
01:20:11,382 --> 01:20:14,093
You know that.
You're one of us.

719
01:20:14,899 --> 01:20:16,773
You murdered your own father!

720
01:20:51,993 --> 01:20:52,799
Amy.

721
01:20:55,178 --> 01:20:56,181
Amy!

722
01:20:57,010 --> 01:20:59,245
- Fuck you!
- Fuck me?

723
01:20:59,280 --> 01:21:02,345
I'd love to. Things I could do to you.

724
01:21:02,380 --> 01:21:05,763
The places I can take you.
The places we can go together.

725
01:21:05,798 --> 01:21:09,133
So what do you say we get out of
these rather unfashionable clothes?

726
01:21:09,168 --> 01:21:12,078
- Fuck...
- You can do better than that!

727
01:21:12,113 --> 01:21:16,085
Profanity is not very profane
when it's used perpetually.

728
01:21:16,120 --> 01:21:18,503
I am feeling the more time
we spend together,

729
01:21:19,312 --> 01:21:20,735
the more you're gonna get to like me.

730
01:21:20,770 --> 01:21:22,464
Don't you know where you are?

731
01:21:23,354 --> 01:21:24,774
This is where you belong.

732
01:21:24,809 --> 01:21:29,766
Tonight the fire is going to consume you
just as it consumed everything.

733
01:21:29,801 --> 01:21:33,942
And then finally, you'll be one of us. Forever.

734
01:21:44,882 --> 01:21:48,265
Don't worry about Nick. Nurses will
take good care of him, I promise.

735
01:22:01,210 --> 01:22:02,461
Let's get started, shall we?

736
01:22:02,496 --> 01:22:04,399
We might still have time
to get a night golf.

737
01:22:04,434 --> 01:22:07,134
I'm awake. Please.
I'm awake. Don't!

738
01:22:08,745 --> 01:22:10,920
I'm about to make first incision.

739
01:22:10,955 --> 01:22:12,167
No!

740
01:22:34,759 --> 01:22:36,481
Thank God!

741
01:22:51,993 --> 01:22:56,910
Oh my dear, we know you're awake.

742
01:23:09,788 --> 01:23:12,900
No. No! No!

743
01:23:14,497 --> 01:23:17,410
Stop! Stop this!

744
01:23:38,458 --> 01:23:39,833
That's it then.

745
01:23:40,712 --> 01:23:43,229
Looks like we won't have time
for that golf after all.

746
01:23:47,025 --> 01:23:48,028
You're not gonna run?

747
01:23:48,794 --> 01:23:50,293
That's best if we stay here.

748
01:23:51,687 --> 01:23:53,660
This is where we belong.

749
01:24:15,917 --> 01:24:19,412
- Just go! Just leave me Ames, go!
- Like hell! Come on, Nick.

750
01:24:22,052 --> 01:24:25,571
Don't run, Amy.
You don't understand.

751
01:24:25,606 --> 01:24:30,781
Tonight fire will consume you
and you will be one of us forever.

752
01:24:30,816 --> 01:24:35,009
- This is where you belong.
- No, I don't!

753
01:24:35,044 --> 01:24:36,025
EXIT

754
01:25:08,362 --> 01:25:12,439
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

755
01:26:08,756 --> 01:26:09,703
Ames.

756
01:26:16,332 --> 01:26:19,513
It was just a test.

757
01:26:21,482 --> 01:26:23,299
It was all a test, wasn't it?

758
01:26:24,049 --> 01:26:28,181
- What was a test?
- I love you, Nick.

759
01:26:29,603 --> 01:26:31,893
I love you so much.

760
01:26:31,928 --> 01:26:35,700
- Please remember that, okay?
- I love you too.

761
01:26:35,735 --> 01:26:37,354
You just hang in there.

762
01:26:38,643 --> 01:26:41,731
- You're gonna be okay.
- No.

763
01:26:44,157 --> 01:26:47,381
But it's okay.
I'm not afraid.

764
01:26:47,416 --> 01:26:50,790
- Ames, stay for me.
- I can't.

765
01:26:51,669 --> 01:26:55,003
It's time for me to go.
I passed the test.

766
01:26:55,038 --> 01:26:57,488
Why the hell are you talking about test?

767
01:26:59,125 --> 01:27:03,732
- I love you.
- Stay with me!

768
01:27:03,767 --> 01:27:04,845
I can't.

769
01:27:06,545 --> 01:27:09,028
Can we get an ambulance over here?

770
01:27:18,624 --> 01:27:24,064
- Who is she?
- I don't know.

771
01:27:25,087 --> 01:27:27,660
I thought I knew her,
but I was wrong.

772
01:27:29,631 --> 01:27:31,744
I think she watches over me.

773
01:27:35,428 --> 01:27:39,830
I love you. I would have married you.

774
01:27:40,750 --> 01:27:42,465
Don't be afraid.

775
01:27:44,244 --> 01:27:45,588
I'm not afraid.

776
01:27:48,062 --> 01:27:49,617
Not anymore.
