1
00:00:11,178 --> 00:00:15,724
Transmorphers

2
00:00:21,188 --> 00:00:24,274
In the 2009 we discover life in another planet.

3
00:00:27,319 --> 00:00:30,405
A planet to 20 millions of years light.

4
00:00:32,324 --> 00:00:34,785
We send a message of peace

5
00:00:34,826 --> 00:00:37,788
...friendship's message.

6
00:01:09,862 --> 00:01:13,407
And five years later we receive their answer.

7
00:01:34,636 --> 00:01:37,848
In few hours, 90% of
the population was destroyed.

8
00:01:38,724 --> 00:01:41,852
The invaders changed the atmosphere

9
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:43,770
and they created an eternal night.

10
00:01:43,812 --> 00:01:46,773
The sun covered forever of dark clouds.

11
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:52,070
The pirates settled down in the earth.

12
00:03:09,106 --> 00:03:12,067
Mr....

13
00:03:12,484 --> 00:03:15,362
- What does it happen?
- It is possible that there are problems

14
00:03:15,404 --> 00:03:16,655
with the scanner.

15
00:03:16,697 --> 00:03:17,990
Why does that believe?

16
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:20,701
Not there has been any movement
in the green line during weeks.

17
00:03:20,742 --> 00:03:23,412
Suddenly there are massive movements advancing.

18
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:26,415
Above the green line.

19
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,961
- Everything seems to be working.
- The scanner in the surface...

20
00:03:31,128 --> 00:03:34,089
Andrew, let us see the front West.

21
00:03:35,465 --> 00:03:38,427
Here it is.

22
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:42,598
That they curse me!

23
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:45,684
It contacts Gral. Van Riber, tell him/her that crossed dog the line.

24
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:52,357
The machines are advancing.

25
00:03:52,399 --> 00:03:54,318
Why are they advancing?

26
00:03:54,359 --> 00:03:55,986
We don't know it.

27
00:03:56,028 --> 00:03:58,238
They get ready for the war.

28
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:01,116
The moment for the director of the union has arrived.

29
00:04:01,158 --> 00:04:03,911
The director of the union of sciences
he/she will give military advice.

30
00:04:03,911 --> 00:04:06,872
The union of sciences has made a technological way

31
00:04:07,164 --> 00:04:08,624
and the time to attack has arrived.

32
00:04:08,624 --> 00:04:11,251
The military union exists to protect all form of life.

33
00:04:11,293 --> 00:04:14,713
Not to organize a mass suicide
that he/she threatens what we have built.

34
00:04:15,964 --> 00:04:18,926
Not we are clever for an assault.

35
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:22,513
We need to recover the planet.

36
00:04:22,971 --> 00:04:26,141
What is speaking is a great one
risk for our society.

37
00:04:26,475 --> 00:04:30,145
He/she makes some instants, he/she informed of
machines that advance more every day.

38
00:04:30,604 --> 00:04:32,648
Sr. Charmon...

39
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:35,651
This is the moment.

40
00:04:37,236 --> 00:04:39,238
- To who want?
- To all!

41
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:40,781
To all?

42
00:04:40,822 --> 00:04:42,658
You listened well, idiot!

43
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:45,661
A hundred years have passed and they don't have
been able to take us out of this rock...

44
00:04:46,078 --> 00:04:49,039
And then, they want to defeat us.

45
00:04:50,916 --> 00:04:53,877
We have to make a plan.

46
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:58,090
Yes, Sra.

47
00:04:58,841 --> 00:05:01,635
Yes! This girl will make something of damage.

48
00:05:01,677 --> 00:05:03,720
If it is that they make something.

49
00:05:03,762 --> 00:05:07,266
These barreneros of plasm
I don't believe that they tolerate a lot.

50
00:05:07,641 --> 00:05:10,602
Non gentlemen, we should be positive.

51
00:05:10,936 --> 00:05:14,356
The fact that nobody has had
success doesn't mean that us

52
00:05:14,648 --> 00:05:17,609
will we have the same luck, certain?

53
00:05:22,656 --> 00:05:25,617
Well, listen. We have prepared
everything so that the transport takes them

54
00:05:25,701 --> 00:05:28,412
to the surface, they will leave at 7:00 o'clock.

55
00:05:28,495 --> 00:05:30,789
Dra. Tedisc will explain to them the objectives

56
00:05:30,831 --> 00:05:33,166
and he/she will speak to them about the teams.

57
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:34,751
It grants a doctorate.

58
00:05:34,793 --> 00:05:36,378
Thank You, General.

59
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:39,548
They have the mission of carrying out an operation.

60
00:05:40,007 --> 00:05:42,467
We will need to neutralize them and to demoralize them for

61
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:44,678
to extract them their primary fuel.

62
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,556
It seems that it is a lot of work. For
what don't we make it more pleasant?

63
00:05:47,598 --> 00:05:49,892
Major! Pay attention.

64
00:05:49,933 --> 00:05:51,602
I sit down it, Sr.

65
00:05:51,643 --> 00:05:53,979
To catch them, we will use this.

66
00:05:54,021 --> 00:05:58,025
It is a version in miniature of the
technology eMag or electromagnetic.

67
00:05:58,525 --> 00:06:01,570
It will create a magnetic field that
it will work in a radio of 6 feet.

68
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:06,116
What is inside the magnetic field
it will be subject to their magnetic pole.

69
00:06:07,034 --> 00:06:10,245
Once caught, I will extract the
cell and you. they will return for

70
00:06:10,454 --> 00:06:13,373
to pass to the second phase of the operation.

71
00:06:13,665 --> 00:06:15,584
Second phase?

72
00:06:15,626 --> 00:06:18,003
They told me that this it would be the only mission.

73
00:06:18,045 --> 00:06:21,006
We are revising the surveillance and the information for

74
00:06:21,131 --> 00:06:23,300
to get ready for the phase two.

75
00:06:23,342 --> 00:06:24,551
Expert?

76
00:06:24,593 --> 00:06:26,720
The rest of its teams consists on masks UV

77
00:06:26,762 --> 00:06:29,389
NKD, airborne grenades...

78
00:06:29,431 --> 00:06:32,976
How well! It seems that we will have
the best in those crazy teams.

79
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:35,395
- Yes!
- Yes!

80
00:06:35,479 --> 00:06:38,440
A variety of detonators of plasm and assault rifles.

81
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:42,486
That if everything comes out well, we will never use.

82
00:06:42,903 --> 00:06:45,739
It is this way. Black Thorne, can he/she explain their strategy?

83
00:06:45,781 --> 00:06:49,284
Yes, Sr. We have to maintain
secretly the whole operation.

84
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:53,622
If we trip with some of them
they will open fire against us.

85
00:06:55,123 --> 00:06:57,334
This operation is strictly secret.

86
00:06:57,376 --> 00:07:00,212
We enter, we place the device, we return and

87
00:07:00,254 --> 00:07:02,005
we let that Dra makes its work.

88
00:07:02,047 --> 00:07:06,218
We have a lot of information, but
they consider us alone an essence.

89
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:10,222
While we don't enter in their road,
they won't enter with us.

90
00:07:10,264 --> 00:07:12,808
We have to be outside of their road.

91
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:15,811
What is there of the escaneo of brains?

92
00:07:16,311 --> 00:07:19,064
Not there is evidence of that technology.

93
00:07:19,106 --> 00:07:20,774
Why now?

94
00:07:20,816 --> 00:07:22,568
Which is the objective?

95
00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:24,820
This mission...

96
00:07:24,862 --> 00:07:27,823
it is part of a long term defense strategy.

97
00:07:28,073 --> 00:07:31,994
The robots have begun to move
with patterns never before seen.

98
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:36,039
This will give us a breach.

99
00:07:36,081 --> 00:07:39,042
If they decide to move offensively.

100
00:07:40,878 --> 00:07:43,839
They are trained for this.

101
00:07:44,882 --> 00:07:46,884
They are the best.

102
00:07:46,925 --> 00:07:49,845
For that reason we have chosen them.

103
00:07:52,014 --> 00:07:56,018
It is everything. Review their mission and
form in the Port II at 6:30 o'clock.

104
00:07:56,435 --> 00:07:59,146
Black Thorne, Clinton, both will be the bosses.

105
00:07:59,188 --> 00:08:02,357
We will be in constant contact, this way
that they will receive direct orders of Gral.

106
00:08:03,275 --> 00:08:06,195
In the field, obey Black Thorne.

107
00:08:06,403 --> 00:08:09,114
Some question?

108
00:08:09,156 --> 00:08:12,117
They can retire.

109
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:21,585
Black Thorne says that it is clever to leave.

110
00:08:21,627 --> 00:08:22,961
Expert.

111
00:08:23,003 --> 00:08:25,672
Here Position II requesting permission for the launching.

112
00:08:25,714 --> 00:08:28,675
- Accepted launching permission.
- Expert.

113
00:08:29,718 --> 00:08:32,679
State.

114
00:08:32,846 --> 00:08:35,349
They are about to leave in the load transport.

115
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:37,226
Do we have image?

116
00:08:37,267 --> 00:08:40,229
Single radar and image sonográfica, we don't have video.

117
00:08:40,646 --> 00:08:43,065
As soon as they arrive to the
surface, we will contact with them.

118
00:08:43,106 --> 00:08:46,068
Yes, Sr.

119
00:08:51,406 --> 00:08:54,409
High all!

120
00:08:57,412 --> 00:08:59,831
This place is worse of that than I thought.

121
00:08:59,873 --> 00:09:02,835
Expert.

122
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:07,881
For sure we should not return?

123
00:09:08,215 --> 00:09:11,176
It takes to your men there, behind that railing.

124
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:16,181
We go, we go.

125
00:09:19,184 --> 00:09:22,187
Bowers, Little S., go back.

126
00:09:32,406 --> 00:09:35,367
Well, I believe that that it is a good place to place the eMag.

127
00:09:35,993 --> 00:09:38,871
- Does he/she believe it to him?
- Of what does he/she speak exactly?

128
00:09:38,912 --> 00:09:41,874
This whole mission. Not they have liberated information.

129
00:09:42,374 --> 00:09:44,543
Alone I complete orders.

130
00:09:44,585 --> 00:09:47,296
Begin the communication.

131
00:09:47,337 --> 00:09:50,299
Major of team Tac, ahead.

132
00:09:51,216 --> 00:09:53,010
Ahead. Cte, we listen to it.

133
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:55,971
We get ready to place the eMag.

134
00:09:57,264 --> 00:09:59,725
Is there robots' movement?

135
00:09:59,766 --> 00:10:02,728
Not I see he/she swims here.

136
00:10:05,063 --> 00:10:07,900
Clinton, do you have better pocisión, what do you see from there?

137
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:10,903
It seems that we have activity in the perimeter.

138
00:10:12,362 --> 00:10:14,865
Have you seen robots' movement in the green line?

139
00:10:14,907 --> 00:10:17,868
Expert. Place the eMag.

140
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:32,633
We go.

141
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,264
The eMag has been placed.

142
00:10:39,306 --> 00:10:42,267
Now we will wait.

143
00:10:45,604 --> 00:10:47,439
Clinton, do you see something?

144
00:10:47,481 --> 00:10:49,650
We should take these lit things.

145
00:10:49,691 --> 00:10:51,527
A complete assault with the weapons in flames.

146
00:10:51,568 --> 00:10:53,403
To begin an assault seems a revolutionary type.

147
00:10:53,445 --> 00:10:55,989
- Maybe they make a mistake when assaulting.
- We will never know it.

148
00:10:56,031 --> 00:10:58,992
Most serves to their superiors.

149
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:09,461
What has that been?

150
00:11:11,171 --> 00:11:13,757
I don't know it.

151
00:11:13,799 --> 00:11:15,050
Gentlemen!

152
00:11:15,092 --> 00:11:18,053
Let us continue.

153
00:11:27,271 --> 00:11:30,232
Cte., has that listened?

154
00:11:32,368 --> 00:11:33,443
Negative.

155
00:11:33,485 --> 00:11:36,446
Do you see something?

156
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:42,911
Negative, Sr. Not there is movement.

157
00:11:42,995 --> 00:11:45,998
McGuire and Black Thorne, not you
they have moved. Report state.

158
00:11:46,373 --> 00:11:49,334
A strong sound, as a motor.

159
00:11:50,711 --> 00:11:53,672
For all sides, they are around for all our.

160
00:11:57,301 --> 00:12:00,262
- We have a problem here!
- What does it happen?

161
00:12:00,971 --> 00:12:03,932
One of ours bleeds for the nose.

162
00:12:04,057 --> 00:12:06,518
Tolerate them, take out them of there.

163
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:09,521
Retire immediately to the arrival place.

164
00:12:09,771 --> 00:12:11,648
Miscarry the mission, I repeat. Miscarry.

165
00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:13,108
Expert, we leave.

166
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:14,818
It is a brain escaneo, I told it to him!

167
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:17,654
Not they have said all the information.
These things are real.

168
00:12:17,696 --> 00:12:20,657
I will make sure that they tell it to me,
but when we return, we go.

169
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:25,162
- What does it happen?
- Let us take to all to the arrival place.

170
00:12:25,204 --> 00:12:26,455
I will explain to it in the road.

171
00:12:26,496 --> 00:12:31,210
Clinton! Cover in the retreat and later he/she returns.

172
00:12:32,419 --> 00:12:35,380
Cover them.

173
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:38,634
- The escan is real.
- Apparently.

174
00:12:38,717 --> 00:12:40,594
Devils!

175
00:12:40,636 --> 00:12:43,597
If their pocisiones is dangerous, I will have to embark.

176
00:12:45,224 --> 00:12:47,184
- Mr.!
- What does it happen?

177
00:12:47,226 --> 00:12:50,938
- Enemy objective has appeared.
- How that have appeared?

178
00:12:51,313 --> 00:12:54,608
These two positions were identified
initially like part of the ferrocarriI.

179
00:12:54,942 --> 00:12:57,903
Now they appear as enemy objective.

180
00:12:59,738 --> 00:13:02,199
What devils is that?

181
00:13:02,241 --> 00:13:04,409
Not they appear in our communication system.

182
00:13:04,451 --> 00:13:08,038
Black Thorne, release you of there. It is
a trap, I repeat, it is a trap.

183
00:13:09,289 --> 00:13:12,251
Let us leave right now! Let us go!

184
00:13:25,013 --> 00:13:27,975
We have contact, I repeat, we have contact!

185
00:13:36,608 --> 00:13:39,653
We have to warn to the command to send air support.

186
00:13:40,153 --> 00:13:42,573
Not proceed with that order.

187
00:13:42,614 --> 00:13:45,409
If we rush, our pocisión will be in danger.

188
00:13:45,492 --> 00:13:48,453
- Not we can allow them to die!
- Not proceed with the order.

189
00:13:56,503 --> 00:13:58,422
When will ARVs come?

190
00:13:58,463 --> 00:14:01,425
Send air support, I repeat, send air support.

191
00:14:07,306 --> 00:14:10,267
Let us continue with the plan, let us return
to the arrival area, we Go.

192
00:14:18,984 --> 00:14:21,945
We have a serious problem.

193
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:26,241
They have changed.

194
00:14:28,869 --> 00:14:32,331
He/she closes the systems of
communication. Turn off them, turn off them!

195
00:14:32,831 --> 00:14:33,916
How ago?

196
00:14:33,957 --> 00:14:36,585
They can rake the communication systems.

197
00:14:36,627 --> 00:14:39,588
If we give them more time, they will pen us.

198
00:14:40,672 --> 00:14:43,634
Then they are attacking.

199
00:14:45,552 --> 00:14:48,514
It gets an extra line for the communication.

200
00:14:55,229 --> 00:14:58,190
We will meet in my camera in 30 minutes.

201
00:15:05,364 --> 00:15:08,325
Yes, Sr!

202
00:15:14,164 --> 00:15:16,250
I have a recommendation.

203
00:15:16,291 --> 00:15:18,961
Two weeks ago they did promote you, do you want to jump?

204
00:15:19,002 --> 00:15:21,964
It leaves of my training like
combat historian consisted

205
00:15:22,297 --> 00:15:24,758
in reading the profiles of the personal officials...

206
00:15:24,842 --> 00:15:26,969
And?

207
00:15:27,052 --> 00:15:30,013
There is a man that is perfect for this mission.

208
00:15:30,472 --> 00:15:32,599
If it is that him same he/she has not decided.

209
00:15:32,641 --> 00:15:35,602
- Neither he/she mentions it!
- It is perfect, and he/she will want to make it.

210
00:15:35,644 --> 00:15:38,564
And the machines can make that that the man not.

211
00:15:38,605 --> 00:15:41,567
- Why?
- It is merciless, cold.

212
00:15:42,025 --> 00:15:44,570
He/she thinks exactly as them, I don't eat us.

213
00:15:44,611 --> 00:15:46,905
Warren Mitchel is a joker.

214
00:15:46,947 --> 00:15:49,116
Not it is controllable.

215
00:15:49,157 --> 00:15:52,244
This mission requires somebody that
obey orders the foot of the letter.

216
00:15:52,661 --> 00:15:56,248
If something happens, the machines will come to us.

217
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,543
The girl protests a lot.

218
00:15:59,585 --> 00:16:02,546
Would Alexandria, like you to participate?

219
00:16:03,964 --> 00:16:08,510
Mitchel has lived in the land during years,
he knows what there is there.

220
00:16:08,552 --> 00:16:11,513
And he/she is the only human that you
it has faced successfully them.

221
00:16:11,972 --> 00:16:17,644
He has offered the information so that
the scientific union obtains the outline.

222
00:16:17,686 --> 00:16:20,647
- Warren Mitchel is...
- He/she is the best man...

223
00:16:21,732 --> 00:16:24,276
...that you have!

224
00:16:24,318 --> 00:16:26,820
I sit down it but,

225
00:16:26,862 --> 00:16:29,823
I don't see none of you. facing
the situation in that way.

226
00:16:30,032 --> 00:16:33,243
Seriously they do believe that the boss will approve this plan?

227
00:16:33,702 --> 00:16:36,705
Directed by a young official or a cadet?

228
00:16:37,956 --> 00:16:40,918
- Without offending.
- She is right.

229
00:16:41,418 --> 00:16:44,046
They will think that we should make it one of us.

230
00:16:44,087 --> 00:16:46,465
Mitchel has demonstrated to be radical.

231
00:16:46,507 --> 00:16:49,510
- Not we can trust him.
- Of agreement.

232
00:16:49,968 --> 00:16:52,429
It is very dangerous.

233
00:16:52,471 --> 00:16:55,432
If it fails, he/she will bring them against us.

234
00:16:58,310 --> 00:17:02,814
Not they fear their errors, they fear their successes.

235
00:17:03,273 --> 00:17:07,945
If it works, it will validate all that that you. they want.

236
00:17:08,862 --> 00:17:11,823
If we combat these machines and we are free,

237
00:17:12,032 --> 00:17:14,993
he will have had the reason.

238
00:17:15,035 --> 00:17:18,080
Their cowardice the blind man.

239
00:17:18,497 --> 00:17:21,458
I don't see you in a camera cryogenic freeze.

240
00:17:22,084 --> 00:17:26,129
Maybe you are you the coward that has
fear of supporting your thoughts.

241
00:17:26,547 --> 00:17:30,300
If Mitchel leads the operation, I will follow it.

242
00:17:32,427 --> 00:17:34,638
And they will make this way it others.

243
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:37,599
Good morning.

244
00:17:55,993 --> 00:17:57,911
Will it be lucid?

245
00:17:57,953 --> 00:17:59,663
Almost immediately.

246
00:17:59,705 --> 00:18:01,373
With colateral smaller effects.

247
00:18:01,415 --> 00:18:04,376
Well. Not we have a lot of time.

248
00:18:11,383 --> 00:18:14,386
McGuire. What pleasure to see you.

249
00:18:14,845 --> 00:18:16,805
I am also glad to see you.

250
00:18:16,847 --> 00:18:18,724
He/she had preferred him to be in better circumstances.

251
00:18:18,765 --> 00:18:20,100
Is it this way?

252
00:18:20,142 --> 00:18:23,103
I thought that there was party while I was there.

253
00:18:24,521 --> 00:18:26,607
How long estube?

254
00:18:26,648 --> 00:18:29,610
Five years with 16 days.

255
00:18:31,486 --> 00:18:34,198
Riber assigned you a mission, he/she needs your help.

256
00:18:34,239 --> 00:18:37,201
Is it a little ironic, don't you believe?

257
00:18:37,451 --> 00:18:39,703
At least I was the first option.

258
00:18:39,745 --> 00:18:41,246
Not it is so much this way.

259
00:18:41,288 --> 00:18:43,582
Black Thorne, made the first intent and it failed.

260
00:18:43,624 --> 00:18:46,585
Does he/she always want to make the alone things, what is there of Walker?

261
00:18:46,877 --> 00:18:49,838
Walker didn't survive the freezing process.

262
00:18:50,047 --> 00:18:51,632
Ichi is still in the process.

263
00:18:51,673 --> 00:18:53,050
Then I will need it.

264
00:18:53,091 --> 00:18:55,177
Nobody more he/she went loyal to the cause.

265
00:18:55,219 --> 00:18:56,970
You will have to go with her.

266
00:18:57,012 --> 00:18:58,931
Because that it is this way.

267
00:18:58,972 --> 00:19:01,934
Do I need appointment?

268
00:19:02,184 --> 00:19:04,478
Not you are under conditions of requesting anything.

269
00:19:04,561 --> 00:19:06,230
Not I am requesting, I am demanding.

270
00:19:06,271 --> 00:19:09,233
To give part of Crownees was not part of the treatment.

271
00:19:10,901 --> 00:19:15,447
You have been reestablished in the service
I activate with Captain's range.

272
00:19:15,864 --> 00:19:18,909
Therefore, you will obey my orders.

273
00:19:21,119 --> 00:19:24,081
You are lucky of being here.

274
00:19:24,873 --> 00:19:27,793
Luck?

275
00:19:30,254 --> 00:19:35,259
When you are icy, your brain still works.

276
00:19:36,552 --> 00:19:39,471
During the last five years, I have had a single dream...

277
00:19:40,597 --> 00:19:43,559
of a world that doesn't exist.

278
00:19:43,642 --> 00:19:46,603
A world where you can see the sun.

279
00:19:47,354 --> 00:19:50,357
And every day there is breeze...

280
00:19:51,692 --> 00:19:54,653
and light...

281
00:19:56,738 --> 00:20:02,870
Now he/she has brought me to a world
I fry, dead, condemned...

282
00:20:03,829 --> 00:20:06,790
I believe that better he/she freezes again...

283
00:20:06,874 --> 00:20:09,835
It is well, he/she will obtain one.

284
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:20,846
We not always wake up where we wanted.

285
00:20:20,888 --> 00:20:23,849
- Does it feel well, Lieutenant?
- Teníente?

286
00:20:24,308 --> 00:20:26,935
What devils?

287
00:20:26,977 --> 00:20:29,271
What do you take?

288
00:20:29,313 --> 00:20:33,609
- Captain...
- Five years have passed, the things have changed a little.

289
00:20:33,650 --> 00:20:36,612
I wait that to improve.

290
00:20:38,197 --> 00:20:41,158
Lieutenant.

291
00:20:41,825 --> 00:20:44,786
Get dressed.

292
00:21:10,604 --> 00:21:13,440
Rest.

293
00:21:13,482 --> 00:21:16,735
The president has approved an operation
military against the machines.

294
00:21:17,152 --> 00:21:20,030
I have spoken with the military consultant,
both have been

295
00:21:20,072 --> 00:21:23,033
chosen to direct the mission.

296
00:21:25,827 --> 00:21:28,205
Now I understand.

297
00:21:28,247 --> 00:21:32,626
I have been frozen during five years
and they take out me to make the dirty work.

298
00:21:33,085 --> 00:21:35,546
Not I have been clear with you.

299
00:21:35,587 --> 00:21:38,340
They have been condemned by betrayal.

300
00:21:38,382 --> 00:21:44,346
- They threatened our security.
- Not there is peace without freedom, neither freedom without fight.

301
00:21:44,388 --> 00:21:47,349
Not we will have an ideological useless debate.

302
00:21:51,854 --> 00:21:55,816
Not I am afraid to fight, and him
I will make when the moment arrives.

303
00:21:56,108 --> 00:21:58,402
When will that be?

304
00:21:58,443 --> 00:22:00,153
If they are successful...

305
00:22:00,195 --> 00:22:03,156
soon, very soon.

306
00:22:03,532 --> 00:22:06,451
They should understand...

307
00:22:06,493 --> 00:22:14,626
that my responsibility is the security of people,
and until that point, I will help them in the mission.

308
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:18,422
But our resources are limited.

309
00:22:19,006 --> 00:22:22,551
It is well because we are
accustomed to make much of anything.

310
00:22:23,010 --> 00:22:24,970
We go...

311
00:22:25,012 --> 00:22:27,931
I am not the enemy, they are the machines.

312
00:22:27,973 --> 00:22:33,729
- Remember it.
- It is a little difficult if you. personally he/she prosecuted us and it imprisoned us.

313
00:22:33,854 --> 00:22:38,066
- I made my work.
- "We completed orders..."

314
00:22:38,483 --> 00:22:41,445
- Ichi.
- He/she waits a moment.

315
00:22:43,864 --> 00:22:47,784
I will ascend and I will take myself charge of my
matters, because it is it I make,

316
00:22:48,202 --> 00:22:54,082
but, I won't obey orders of you. Gral.,
I will follow it to him and it is everything.

317
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:57,002
That made it is bad.

318
00:22:57,044 --> 00:23:00,297
I won't sit down here to fake that everything is well.

319
00:23:01,173 --> 00:23:04,134
For that is not this way.

320
00:23:07,387 --> 00:23:09,473
I request permission to retire.

321
00:23:09,515 --> 00:23:12,476
Granted.

322
00:23:17,064 --> 00:23:20,025
Not it has changed neither a little.

323
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:23,820
- I already see why you chose it.
- Is he the best, has it finished?

324
00:23:24,905 --> 00:23:27,866
Yes.

325
00:23:28,492 --> 00:23:30,869
Warren!

326
00:23:30,911 --> 00:23:34,122
Take away from her. He/she has made a decision.

327
00:23:35,082 --> 00:23:37,459
Of course.

328
00:23:37,501 --> 00:23:40,170
The only thing that I have wanted is their happiness.

329
00:23:40,212 --> 00:23:42,506
If she is happy... that it is this way.

330
00:23:42,548 --> 00:23:45,509
We marry three months after your sentence.

331
00:23:45,884 --> 00:23:48,720
Remember it.

332
00:23:48,762 --> 00:23:51,723
- It can leave.
- Yes, Sr.

333
00:24:08,532 --> 00:24:11,493
Ahead.

334
00:24:14,746 --> 00:24:17,708
Not I have a lot of time, alone he/she wanted
to start to the point before the official statement.

335
00:24:21,128 --> 00:24:24,423
- Do you want a swig?
- No, thank you. I am well.

336
00:24:29,887 --> 00:24:32,848
Is it official?

337
00:24:32,890 --> 00:24:35,851
Yes. Almost five years.

338
00:24:38,312 --> 00:24:41,148
Have you felt secondary effects?

339
00:24:41,190 --> 00:24:43,442
Some sickness, anything serious.

340
00:24:43,483 --> 00:24:46,445
They don't usually take out people of the freezing.

341
00:24:46,570 --> 00:24:49,531
You had an a hundred year-old sentence.

342
00:24:49,698 --> 00:24:52,659
It seems that it has been changed by the death penalty.

343
00:24:52,784 --> 00:24:54,578
Because this it is your opportunity.

344
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:57,581
You can demonstrate that they were mistaken.

345
00:24:59,833 --> 00:25:02,211
Not I came to apologize...

346
00:25:02,252 --> 00:25:04,254
of being this way...

347
00:25:04,296 --> 00:25:06,215
I should apologize with you.

348
00:25:06,256 --> 00:25:09,218
Both made what we believed that it was correct.

349
00:25:11,929 --> 00:25:14,890
I should leave.

350
00:25:34,701 --> 00:25:37,663
Mitch!

351
00:25:38,163 --> 00:25:41,416
It seems that to be frozen during
five years he/she is moved a little.

352
00:25:43,377 --> 00:25:46,338
They are clever.

353
00:26:19,788 --> 00:26:22,457
This doesn't shine well.

354
00:26:22,499 --> 00:26:25,460
That seems.

355
00:26:25,836 --> 00:26:28,213
The doubt guarantees the death.

356
00:26:28,255 --> 00:26:31,008
When I give an order, you.
they have to be quick and resolved.

357
00:26:31,049 --> 00:26:32,801
Sergeant Tacker, a step ahead.

358
00:26:32,885 --> 00:26:35,804
- Hit me.
- Sr?

359
00:26:36,930 --> 00:26:39,975
The doubt guarantees the death.

360
00:26:42,144 --> 00:26:44,229
Smyth, a step ahead.

361
00:26:44,271 --> 00:26:47,232
Hit me.

362
00:26:48,066 --> 00:26:50,319
The execution is similar of important.

363
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:53,447
Not doubt and execute each order in their entirety.

364
00:26:54,281 --> 00:26:57,242
The rest, hit me!

365
00:27:12,549 --> 00:27:15,010
Show you.

366
00:27:15,052 --> 00:27:17,930
You not, her.

367
00:27:17,971 --> 00:27:20,933
She stays, the other ones, they can leave.

368
00:27:28,273 --> 00:27:31,235
Those boys... I won't achieve it.

369
00:27:32,152 --> 00:27:35,113
Plan B.

370
00:27:37,199 --> 00:27:39,535
We need more voluntary.

371
00:27:39,618 --> 00:27:42,579
- Is this secret?
- Yes.

372
00:27:43,038 --> 00:27:45,958
Very secret.

373
00:27:45,999 --> 00:27:49,670
To violate a direct order and
to inspire others to make the same thing...

374
00:27:50,003 --> 00:27:54,049
the reason is not for the one that you/they put us in the ice?

375
00:27:56,176 --> 00:27:59,137
What have they made those glasses of ice to your brain?

376
00:28:00,055 --> 00:28:04,893
We have been born to be eaten before the strong plate.

377
00:28:07,062 --> 00:28:08,605
Well.

378
00:28:08,689 --> 00:28:11,608
- Ichi.
- Yes.

379
00:28:11,692 --> 00:28:13,569
Please, it looks for something to smoke.

380
00:28:13,610 --> 00:28:16,572
I will warn you if I find something.

381
00:28:29,918 --> 00:28:32,880
Thank you.

382
00:28:41,597 --> 00:28:44,558
Why so much secret? What does it happen?

383
00:28:44,641 --> 00:28:46,685
We need your help.

384
00:28:46,727 --> 00:28:49,688
Van Riber has offered a handful of boys.

385
00:28:49,855 --> 00:28:51,982
Not I know why you are so surprised.

386
00:28:52,024 --> 00:28:54,985
Black Thorne was conquered very quick.

387
00:28:55,986 --> 00:28:58,197
You know like they are the volunteers.

388
00:28:58,238 --> 00:29:01,200
What are there of you?

389
00:29:02,117 --> 00:29:04,745
We are had forbidden to fraternize with you.

390
00:29:04,786 --> 00:29:07,748
It is what we can make to avoid that they freeze us.

391
00:29:09,499 --> 00:29:12,628
There is somebody that I know that
can it disobey the orders?

392
00:29:13,086 --> 00:29:16,048
You can make it.

393
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:19,301
Certain?

394
00:29:19,510 --> 00:29:21,553
Well, well.

395
00:29:21,595 --> 00:29:24,556
Not it will be anything that he/she has not made before.

396
00:29:26,099 --> 00:29:29,061
I will speak with her and I will see what he/she can make.

397
00:29:34,191 --> 00:29:36,735
You owe me a dinner.

398
00:29:36,777 --> 00:29:41,156
I believe that it was... five years ago.

399
00:29:41,615 --> 00:29:44,576
Better afternoon that never.

400
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:50,582
The meeting is in the morning, it gets somebody.

401
00:29:51,083 --> 00:29:54,044
Ichi...

402
00:29:56,296 --> 00:29:59,007
I have brought you this.

403
00:29:59,049 --> 00:30:02,010
Thank you, you are a doll.

404
00:30:02,052 --> 00:30:06,223
For you, Cte. Doll, Tte.

405
00:30:07,099 --> 00:30:10,060
Go, Tte.

406
00:30:23,490 --> 00:30:26,451
Rest.

407
00:30:30,539 --> 00:30:34,376
The task that we have been assigned is not fáci!

408
00:30:34,418 --> 00:30:37,379
- If we are successful...
- We will have it...

409
00:30:38,005 --> 00:30:40,174
empty man.

410
00:30:40,215 --> 00:30:43,177
We are the "padded" men.

411
00:30:43,427 --> 00:30:47,764
Together for a term of life.

412
00:30:48,265 --> 00:30:49,933
Welcome Alexandria.

413
00:30:49,975 --> 00:30:54,396
I request permission to obey orders
direct and to cause massive destruction.

414
00:30:55,397 --> 00:30:58,358
Granted.

415
00:31:05,115 --> 00:31:08,076
Our lives...

416
00:31:08,285 --> 00:31:11,413
the lives of all those that know, will never be same.

417
00:31:12,331 --> 00:31:16,126
They will obey my orders but not
they will fight for my, they will fight for themselves.

418
00:31:16,627 --> 00:31:21,131
For their life and for the whole generation that continues.

419
00:31:21,673 --> 00:31:24,635
Doctor Aleksovich.

420
00:31:27,304 --> 00:31:29,139
Hello...

421
00:31:29,181 --> 00:31:33,352
my name is Boloslav Aleksovich and...

422
00:31:33,769 --> 00:31:36,730
I have been happened a small idea...

423
00:31:38,315 --> 00:31:42,027
inside each machine there is a cell of fuel.

424
00:31:42,319 --> 00:31:47,407
It is an energy source, but also
it is their primary form of communication.

425
00:31:47,449 --> 00:31:50,410
They think for itself,

426
00:31:50,577 --> 00:31:53,038
basically at times...

427
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:58,836
but they have commands that come
of a system central computadorizado.

428
00:31:58,919 --> 00:32:03,924
That makes, it is to take a new code
and we program it in a cell of fuel.

429
00:32:03,966 --> 00:32:08,095
Then, this it is inserted in the main base...

430
00:32:09,304 --> 00:32:12,307
of the system and east sends signs...

431
00:32:13,267 --> 00:32:16,562
that they order to the machine to fade.

432
00:32:17,437 --> 00:32:18,605
To all.

433
00:32:18,647 --> 00:32:19,940
Is everything?

434
00:32:19,982 --> 00:32:25,237
We will go against them, with the weapons in flames,
and we will make them disappear.

435
00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:26,697
It is very easy.

436
00:32:26,738 --> 00:32:29,324
It is a little more complicated.

437
00:32:29,366 --> 00:32:32,411
When we put an end to a robot,
the cells expel the fuel.

438
00:32:32,870 --> 00:32:38,375
We need to capture first one of them
so that the scientific gremío can go
to the land to carry out their operation.

439
00:32:38,417 --> 00:32:41,378
There is a contramedida that assures...

440
00:32:43,255 --> 00:32:46,758
...that we make it, or let us try to make it.

441
00:32:51,597 --> 00:32:53,473
We will divide ourselves in two teams.

442
00:32:53,515 --> 00:32:55,976
Cte. Lurx, will direct a division, me the other one.

443
00:32:56,018 --> 00:32:58,395
We will ambush to the patrol car of robots.

444
00:32:58,437 --> 00:33:01,398
We will take the whole unit, a functional one.

445
00:33:01,523 --> 00:33:04,484
The remaining robots, will be
our special companies.

446
00:33:06,278 --> 00:33:09,198
They can intercept any
communication transmission,

447
00:33:09,239 --> 00:33:11,783
so any comunicador is not authorized.

448
00:33:11,825 --> 00:33:15,204
It will be to the old one, point out of hand and some that another scream.

449
00:33:15,537 --> 00:33:18,749
Once we have to the machine, we return to the area

450
00:33:19,625 --> 00:33:21,168
and we transfer the data.

451
00:33:21,210 --> 00:33:24,087
Not it would be safer to bring it here?

452
00:33:24,129 --> 00:33:29,885
No, not. They are cells with devices of I rake,
and if we bring them, they will know where we are.

453
00:33:31,803 --> 00:33:34,306
We leave at 12:00 o'clock.

454
00:33:34,348 --> 00:33:37,309
They have today's day to speak with their family.

455
00:33:37,434 --> 00:33:40,229
We will see each other here at 7:00 o'clock.

456
00:33:40,270 --> 00:33:41,939
Questions.

457
00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:44,942
Once we are successful,
what will it happen later?

458
00:33:45,192 --> 00:33:47,152
We will go to the collection point.

459
00:33:47,194 --> 00:33:50,155
We will maintain the offensive in the tower.

460
00:33:52,574 --> 00:33:55,536
They can leave.

461
00:33:58,580 --> 00:34:01,542
I hope it doesn't bother you there are you
chosen to direct the divísión.

462
00:34:01,667 --> 00:34:03,418
For anything.

463
00:34:03,460 --> 00:34:06,421
He/she didn't imagine it otherwise.

464
00:34:10,342 --> 00:34:12,469
Karina...

465
00:34:12,553 --> 00:34:15,889
what so pleasant surprise.

466
00:34:17,516 --> 00:34:20,477
Do you spy us?

467
00:34:22,729 --> 00:34:24,815
Do a favor...

468
00:34:24,857 --> 00:34:29,278
keep your court garbage soldierly for the return.

469
00:34:36,660 --> 00:34:38,328
Don't pay him/her attention.

470
00:34:38,370 --> 00:34:40,414
- That attempts,
- What do you make here?

471
00:34:40,455 --> 00:34:42,708
I Will Go with You.

472
00:34:42,749 --> 00:34:45,210
You should be joking.

473
00:34:45,252 --> 00:34:50,799
- I doubt that your wife approves it.
- They should know that nobody can control me!

474
00:34:50,841 --> 00:34:53,802
Because I will make it.

475
00:34:55,220 --> 00:34:58,515
- We see each other at 7:00 o'clock.
- We see each other then.

476
00:35:03,562 --> 00:35:06,440
At what do you laugh?

477
00:35:06,481 --> 00:35:09,401
Problems.

478
00:35:10,194 --> 00:35:13,030
Have.

479
00:35:13,113 --> 00:35:16,033
- Luz like who needs them.
- Thank you.

480
00:35:16,325 --> 00:35:19,953
Will the boys and I drink, do you come?

481
00:35:20,996 --> 00:35:23,957
- No, thank you.
- Why? We go.

482
00:35:25,125 --> 00:35:28,086
I believe that I will read.

483
00:35:30,088 --> 00:35:33,050
It is touching.

484
00:35:34,259 --> 00:35:37,221
To look for the way to take three weapons...

485
00:35:38,222 --> 00:35:40,390
What devils do they make with our things?

486
00:35:40,432 --> 00:35:43,393
- They won't need them.
- We will return.

487
00:35:43,435 --> 00:35:46,021
Ah, yes!

488
00:35:46,063 --> 00:35:49,024
- I always wanted the bed of up.
- Me also.

489
00:35:49,191 --> 00:35:52,110
Seriously, go away.

490
00:35:52,236 --> 00:35:54,530
It is supposed that meetings are.

491
00:35:54,571 --> 00:35:56,490
The center is only.

492
00:35:56,532 --> 00:36:00,410
The leader will go with us, if there is somebody
that it is outside of range they are you.

493
00:36:00,452 --> 00:36:03,038
Not we will take a risk the life for a ridiculous dream.

494
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:05,999
- Us neither.
- Don't come closer to her, Tte.

495
00:36:06,166 --> 00:36:09,127
Take away from my things, Ctan!

496
00:36:10,170 --> 00:36:13,131
Is it violating an order of a superior?

497
00:36:15,592 --> 00:36:18,762
I am violating an order of a coward.

498
00:36:43,745 --> 00:36:46,540
Get up of the floor! Do you want to hit me?

499
00:36:46,582 --> 00:36:49,168
Do you like it?

500
00:36:49,209 --> 00:36:51,795
- Veto to the shit!
- Coarse!

501
00:36:51,837 --> 00:36:53,839
Not I will allow!

502
00:36:53,881 --> 00:36:55,757
Not I will allow this!

503
00:36:55,799 --> 00:36:58,802
Let us combat against the machines, not against us.

504
00:36:59,136 --> 00:37:02,097
What does it happen?

505
00:37:04,266 --> 00:37:07,227
Captain!

506
00:37:07,352 --> 00:37:10,314
We try to see what we will make when they don't return.

507
00:37:12,524 --> 00:37:15,194
Thank you for the vote of trust.

508
00:37:15,235 --> 00:37:18,197
- He/she abandons the platoon.
- I will save the world!

509
00:37:18,447 --> 00:37:20,741
And you had the opportunity to come with us.

510
00:37:20,782 --> 00:37:24,244
- Not I will take a risk my career.
- Your career?

511
00:37:26,288 --> 00:37:28,540
Is what this means for you?

512
00:37:28,582 --> 00:37:30,250
A career?

513
00:37:30,292 --> 00:37:35,881
I didn't enroll for a check, I enrolled to combat.

514
00:37:36,298 --> 00:37:38,884
This war already takes hundred of years!

515
00:37:38,926 --> 00:37:41,887
And now we decide to combat her.

516
00:37:43,013 --> 00:37:45,641
They were right about you.

517
00:37:45,682 --> 00:37:48,644
You are a traitor.

518
00:38:07,162 --> 00:38:08,664
Something that you should know...

519
00:38:08,705 --> 00:38:11,875
it is that I am much stronger that you.

520
00:38:12,334 --> 00:38:18,966
- Come unfastened!
- Not he/she would give my life for none of you, pieces of garbage.

521
00:38:19,299 --> 00:38:22,261
And if that is to be a traitor...

522
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:27,641
that it is this way.

523
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:41,321
Ladies and Gentlemen, I propose a toast.

524
00:38:41,572 --> 00:38:44,533
For the soldiers that never give the back to their enemy,

525
00:38:44,867 --> 00:38:47,828
neither they leave that a friend of the back neither.

526
00:38:52,416 --> 00:38:54,251
What does it happen? Not you do drink?

527
00:38:54,334 --> 00:38:56,211
Not I drink.

528
00:38:56,253 --> 00:38:59,715
Is that a little boring, don't you believe?

529
00:39:00,591 --> 00:39:03,010
She doesn't drink anything...

530
00:39:03,051 --> 00:39:06,013
it is an android.

531
00:39:07,598 --> 00:39:10,559
A robot, but I don't eat them...

532
00:39:10,851 --> 00:39:13,270
I built it.

533
00:39:13,312 --> 00:39:16,231
I made some inverse engineering.

534
00:39:17,441 --> 00:39:20,611
I believe that I will leave, too much company.

535
00:39:26,033 --> 00:39:28,243
We see each other.

536
00:39:28,285 --> 00:39:30,037
It shines so real.

537
00:39:30,078 --> 00:39:31,830
Is it magnificent, certain?

538
00:39:31,872 --> 00:39:33,457
All synthetic one.

539
00:39:33,498 --> 00:39:37,753
- How many of those things we do have?
- Alone her and other...

540
00:39:38,212 --> 00:39:40,422
but it didn't leave as her.

541
00:39:40,464 --> 00:39:43,217
Everything is very well.

542
00:39:43,258 --> 00:39:46,220
Doctor...

543
00:39:50,516 --> 00:39:52,726
When he/she returns...

544
00:39:52,768 --> 00:39:55,729
can one make for my?

545
00:39:56,980 --> 00:39:59,024
Not I see reason for which cannot make it.

546
00:39:59,066 --> 00:40:02,027
Excellent.

547
00:40:04,571 --> 00:40:07,533
I know the risks.

548
00:40:07,866 --> 00:40:10,827
Not I can get lost.

549
00:40:11,078 --> 00:40:14,039
Have some faith.

550
00:40:14,164 --> 00:40:15,749
You know it.

551
00:40:15,791 --> 00:40:18,752
You don't know it.

552
00:40:19,169 --> 00:40:22,130
With them not.

553
00:40:22,506 --> 00:40:24,383
With them not...

554
00:40:24,424 --> 00:40:27,386
neither with him.

555
00:40:37,646 --> 00:40:39,439
All are here, they are clever.

556
00:40:39,481 --> 00:40:41,191
Well, I need authorization.

557
00:40:41,233 --> 00:40:44,570
It rains the whole time, so care where they step.

558
00:40:44,987 --> 00:40:47,948
Not load the weapons until
let us be clever for the combat.

559
00:40:48,740 --> 00:40:51,243
They can feel our energy changes.

560
00:40:51,285 --> 00:40:55,205
The most important thing, if they feel sickness,
if their hearings begin to sound...

561
00:40:55,581 --> 00:40:57,124
or if their nose bleeds...

562
00:40:57,165 --> 00:41:00,002
...they can be sure that it is a brain escaneo.

563
00:41:00,043 --> 00:41:02,963
It means the worst thing.

564
00:41:04,214 --> 00:41:07,176
- Something more?
- No.

565
00:41:07,426 --> 00:41:12,806
Follow my orders, take care of their
backs and those of the other ones.

566
00:41:13,765 --> 00:41:16,185
Not leave behind anybody.

567
00:41:16,226 --> 00:41:19,188
Let us begin. Ahead!

568
00:41:32,659 --> 00:41:35,537
Our day of luck.

569
00:41:35,579 --> 00:41:38,582
Lurx, goes with your people to that high land.

570
00:41:39,875 --> 00:41:42,711
Joe, will take to your team to the right!

571
00:41:42,711 --> 00:41:46,465
Well, separate. Carefully, remember
the orders, the rest goes for my.

572
00:42:02,022 --> 00:42:03,565
How many are they?

573
00:42:03,607 --> 00:42:05,859
Twenty, two lines of 10.

574
00:42:05,901 --> 00:42:08,862
Expert. I will remain here in case you fail.

575
00:42:09,238 --> 00:42:11,573
I don't fail.

576
00:42:11,615 --> 00:42:14,535
Alone just in case.

577
00:42:16,328 --> 00:42:19,289
They are close.

578
00:42:20,123 --> 00:42:23,085
We will go with Ichi, take care of the shot.

579
00:42:29,132 --> 00:42:31,552
We will go toward before, cover.

580
00:42:31,593 --> 00:42:34,555
Expert?

581
00:42:53,073 --> 00:42:55,951
Now!

582
00:43:24,146 --> 00:43:27,107
- Are all well?
- Stay together.

583
00:43:28,692 --> 00:43:30,694
They have him escaneado!

584
00:43:30,736 --> 00:43:32,196
We have to leave

585
00:43:32,237 --> 00:43:35,199
- Let us go!
- Let us go, let us go!

586
00:44:48,230 --> 00:44:51,191
We need a road to escape!

587
00:44:51,233 --> 00:44:54,194
Stop the fire and marchémonos.

588
00:44:54,194 --> 00:44:57,155
No! We have to go over there.

589
00:44:57,531 --> 00:44:59,074
Not we can return.

590
00:44:59,116 --> 00:45:03,495
- They are in the road!
- We will pull up them the head!

591
00:45:04,746 --> 00:45:07,666
All! Against them!

592
00:45:20,637 --> 00:45:22,723
They have not still arrived to the place.

593
00:45:22,764 --> 00:45:25,559
It is very chancy to use communication devices.

594
00:45:25,601 --> 00:45:27,227
- Not we have idea of...
- One hour has passed.

595
00:45:27,269 --> 00:45:30,230
They have opened fire in the battle field.

596
00:45:34,818 --> 00:45:37,779
Mrs..

597
00:45:38,614 --> 00:45:41,241
Another half hour more.

598
00:45:41,283 --> 00:45:44,244
Then we will send a team
to look for the survivors.

599
00:45:52,336 --> 00:45:55,297
Lurx, Ichi!

600
00:46:16,735 --> 00:46:19,780
Blair!

601
00:46:23,575 --> 00:46:25,369
What do you make?

602
00:46:25,410 --> 00:46:28,038
He/she is Blair, I will reach them in the collection place.

603
00:46:28,121 --> 00:46:31,083
- Karina, you should...
- Not we will leave anybody!

604
00:46:42,511 --> 00:46:45,472
Cover them, cover them!

605
00:46:55,899 --> 00:46:58,861
Burn it, burn this place!

606
00:46:59,194 --> 00:47:02,155
Burn them!

607
00:47:09,204 --> 00:47:10,789
Drops.

608
00:47:10,831 --> 00:47:12,374
Alone we are 10.

609
00:47:12,416 --> 00:47:14,042
Five were ahead...

610
00:47:14,084 --> 00:47:15,544
Where is Letier?

611
00:47:15,586 --> 00:47:17,212
It Was for Blair.

612
00:47:17,254 --> 00:47:20,215
It was a good work, Captain.

613
00:47:20,465 --> 00:47:23,427
We will look for support and I look for it again.

614
00:47:23,802 --> 00:47:26,805
We will return.

615
00:47:26,847 --> 00:47:28,974
Expert.

616
00:47:28,974 --> 00:47:31,977
We go.

617
00:47:36,690 --> 00:47:38,358
State.

618
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:39,735
They are in road.

619
00:47:39,776 --> 00:47:42,738
Let us have all clever one.

620
00:47:54,249 --> 00:47:56,710
- Are you well?
- Yes.

621
00:47:56,793 --> 00:47:59,713
That believes.

622
00:48:09,431 --> 00:48:12,392
- For sure you are well?
- Yes.

623
00:48:19,191 --> 00:48:22,152
Cover!

624
00:48:42,297 --> 00:48:45,259
Well.

625
00:48:46,635 --> 00:48:49,596
We have to leave.

626
00:48:51,348 --> 00:48:54,309
Wait!

627
00:48:54,518 --> 00:48:57,437
The tower! We have to wait to the other ones!

628
00:49:01,483 --> 00:49:04,319
And if they don't achieve it?

629
00:49:04,361 --> 00:49:07,322
They will make it.

630
00:49:10,534 --> 00:49:15,372
- I will return to look for it.
- How?

631
00:49:15,414 --> 00:49:18,125
Not you can take charge first of him?

632
00:49:18,166 --> 00:49:21,128
Mitchel, we need you.

633
00:49:21,795 --> 00:49:24,756
She won't want you to take a risk this.

634
00:49:28,552 --> 00:49:31,054
He/she closes the perimeter, they will arrive in few minutes.

635
00:49:31,096 --> 00:49:34,057
Expert.

636
00:49:40,689 --> 00:49:43,650
One, two, three.

637
00:49:50,949 --> 00:49:53,410
Not what waited was?

638
00:49:53,452 --> 00:49:56,330
No.

639
00:49:56,371 --> 00:49:58,624
Will it work?

640
00:49:58,665 --> 00:50:00,751
Yes, me...

641
00:50:00,792 --> 00:50:03,337
we always speculate about the created machines

642
00:50:03,378 --> 00:50:06,048
for species alienígenas but...

643
00:50:06,089 --> 00:50:09,051
They are the martian.

644
00:50:14,223 --> 00:50:17,184
Now we will have to hurry.

645
00:50:19,770 --> 00:50:22,731
I suppose that we had made a mistake.

646
00:50:22,898 --> 00:50:25,817
We all had you like a rat.

647
00:50:26,985 --> 00:50:29,738
I never declared against anybody.

648
00:50:29,780 --> 00:50:31,698
Taenia fear.

649
00:50:31,740 --> 00:50:34,243
As the other ones.

650
00:50:34,284 --> 00:50:37,246
Today you made the correct thing.

651
00:50:37,371 --> 00:50:40,332
Thank you.

652
00:50:55,681 --> 00:50:58,642
One minute...

653
00:51:03,522 --> 00:51:06,483
Tell him/her that we have a great attack.

654
00:51:08,527 --> 00:51:11,488
- Bad news, Sr.
- Ichi.

655
00:51:12,823 --> 00:51:18,495
- Dr. we need to evacuate.
- Not we have finished.

656
00:51:18,996 --> 00:51:21,748
We need to move!

657
00:51:21,790 --> 00:51:24,585
We have already arrived to the most difficult place,

658
00:51:24,626 --> 00:51:27,588
he/she knows that the machines would be in the city in hours.

659
00:51:27,838 --> 00:51:30,716
Not we can leave that they find us, we will find another

660
00:51:30,757 --> 00:51:33,719
we have to leave, now.

661
00:51:36,138 --> 00:51:39,099
Doctor...

662
00:51:43,187 --> 00:51:46,148
Pick up everything, we leave.

663
00:51:50,569 --> 00:51:52,863
- Take it!
- But, Mister...

664
00:51:52,905 --> 00:51:55,866
Make it.

665
00:52:00,370 --> 00:52:03,332
Let us go!

666
00:52:16,678 --> 00:52:18,764
From where have they left?

667
00:52:18,805 --> 00:52:22,059
- There is an exit to 500 meters.
- Not look behind!

668
00:52:22,476 --> 00:52:25,562
- Expert! What will he/she make?
- I will cover them.

669
00:52:26,063 --> 00:52:29,024
Well, we go.

670
00:52:31,443 --> 00:52:33,862
- Go, all!
- I will stay!

671
00:52:33,904 --> 00:52:36,907
Non questions an order, go with them!

672
00:52:38,008 --> 00:52:39,647
I hope to leave with the prize.

673
00:52:39,698 --> 00:52:42,054
I believe that a confrontation
direct it would be better.

674
00:52:42,155 --> 00:52:44,164
We will go of front and we will continue the fire.

675
00:52:44,248 --> 00:52:47,209
- The weapons to fire.
- Not it could be in another way.

676
00:53:03,359 --> 00:53:05,786
It worked. They achieved it.

677
00:53:06,007 --> 00:53:07,752
Well. You have made it well.

678
00:53:08,003 --> 00:53:10,348
We go, Mitchel, we won't be able to return.

679
00:53:10,449 --> 00:53:13,544
We will arrive to the tower,
who do you believe that he/she will make it?

680
00:53:14,005 --> 00:53:15,445
Good question.

681
00:53:17,406 --> 00:53:21,059
- I cover you, you go.
- You should return, I cover you.

682
00:53:21,235 --> 00:53:22,786
Let us go, let us go!

683
00:54:02,284 --> 00:54:05,245
Does he/she need help, Captain?

684
00:54:07,289 --> 00:54:10,125
I never planned to see them again.

685
00:54:10,167 --> 00:54:13,128
Let us go!

686
00:54:17,299 --> 00:54:19,551
What devils did you think?

687
00:54:19,635 --> 00:54:21,762
Karina is still there, I will return.

688
00:54:21,803 --> 00:54:23,180
Yes indeed.

689
00:54:23,222 --> 00:54:26,141
- Rafael prepared the team, I will go.
- Yes, Sr.

690
00:54:26,225 --> 00:54:28,560
- Not of the order.
- How?

691
00:54:28,602 --> 00:54:31,855
I will go! You. he/she has to make sure
that this mission finishes.

692
00:54:32,231 --> 00:54:35,192
Why don't they go? I don't care it.

693
00:54:35,943 --> 00:54:38,695
- She is my wife.
- I am the soldier.

694
00:54:38,737 --> 00:54:43,034
If she is he/she still lives, I will find it. You
you have the responsibility of staying...

695
00:54:43,105 --> 00:54:45,006
Don't give me lessons.

696
00:54:45,827 --> 00:54:47,579
Gentlemen!

697
00:54:47,621 --> 00:54:50,582
They have to come to the laboratory.

698
00:54:53,335 --> 00:54:56,213
He/she prepares the troops.

699
00:54:56,255 --> 00:54:58,215
It is the objective, Mitchel.

700
00:54:58,257 --> 00:55:00,342
We go.

701
00:55:00,384 --> 00:55:03,387
Rand, uses everything. Make sure that the flight is clever.

702
00:55:03,887 --> 00:55:05,889
Expert, welcome Sr.

703
00:55:05,931 --> 00:55:07,432
Thank you.

704
00:55:07,516 --> 00:55:11,019
Get ready, we will knock down them.

705
00:55:19,278 --> 00:55:21,905
How ago that here!

706
00:55:21,947 --> 00:55:24,116
- Not we had option.
- I told him/her that he/she left it!

707
00:55:24,157 --> 00:55:25,964
Eliminate it immediately!

708
00:55:26,065 --> 00:55:29,447
If the device of I rake
it works, it is already very late.

709
00:55:33,709 --> 00:55:35,670
How long does he/she need?

710
00:55:37,337 --> 00:55:41,133
- There are some complications.
- Alone one second, I don't still finish!

711
00:55:41,592 --> 00:55:44,595
- Explain you.
- The robots Z...

712
00:55:44,928 --> 00:55:48,538
they are complétamentemecánicos but, these
types Z is partially organic,

713
00:55:48,639 --> 00:55:51,310
in fact, they are cyborg
organic that is magnificent...

714
00:55:51,351 --> 00:55:53,103
- Dr. please!
- It is well.

715
00:55:53,145 --> 00:55:57,274
I thought of placing the machine in
a source of temporary energy...

716
00:55:57,858 --> 00:56:01,987
- But...
- But, this organism...

717
00:56:03,405 --> 00:56:06,366
he/she could die if I make it.

718
00:56:08,202 --> 00:56:10,287
Recommendations.

719
00:56:10,329 --> 00:56:12,623
Do make what can, what we would lose?

720
00:56:12,664 --> 00:56:14,541
We have to attempt it.

721
00:56:14,583 --> 00:56:17,503
Make it.

722
00:56:17,544 --> 00:56:20,506
Bands.

723
00:56:24,092 --> 00:56:27,054
Thermal harnesses.

724
00:56:32,392 --> 00:56:36,688
Slowly.

725
00:56:36,730 --> 00:56:39,483
Dr. we lose it, we lose it!

726
00:56:39,525 --> 00:56:41,777
He/she has died.

727
00:56:41,818 --> 00:56:43,570
Damned!

728
00:56:43,612 --> 00:56:46,406
They have been!

729
00:56:46,448 --> 00:56:49,409
They have reached our perimeter.

730
00:56:50,953 --> 00:56:53,830
They have reached the perimeter.

731
00:56:53,872 --> 00:56:56,208
Organize the intercepción!

732
00:56:56,250 --> 00:56:59,211
- Take them away from the city!
- We should be careful!

733
00:56:59,419 --> 00:57:02,172
- If it fails the decoder!
- We return.

734
00:57:02,214 --> 00:57:06,134
We will make an assault and ourselves
we will retire, it is our best weapon.

735
00:57:07,761 --> 00:57:10,722
That it is this way.

736
00:57:13,809 --> 00:57:16,061
It tries that this is.

737
00:57:16,103 --> 00:57:18,564
Reorganize their team...

738
00:57:18,605 --> 00:57:21,358
and finish their damned mission.

739
00:57:21,400 --> 00:57:24,361
Yes, Sr.

740
00:57:30,868 --> 00:57:33,161
The union has requested an upgrade.

741
00:57:33,203 --> 00:57:35,414
Are we in war, what does he/she believe of that upgrade?

742
00:57:35,455 --> 00:57:37,165
It is unacceptable. I still need...

743
00:57:37,207 --> 00:57:38,792
With all respect!

744
00:57:38,834 --> 00:57:41,879
Not there is time for the debate and the deliberation.

745
00:57:42,337 --> 00:57:45,299
We are in war.

746
00:57:45,465 --> 00:57:48,427
They have trusted the population's care.

747
00:57:51,138 --> 00:57:54,099
Will it allow me to make my work?

748
00:57:54,600 --> 00:57:57,060
That it is this way.

749
00:57:57,102 --> 00:57:58,187
Thank you.

750
00:57:58,228 --> 00:58:01,190
Light it... everything.

751
00:58:02,107 --> 00:58:05,068
There is something lowering.

752
00:58:07,237 --> 00:58:10,199
He/she has to have another way.

753
00:58:12,242 --> 00:58:14,244
There is him...

754
00:58:14,244 --> 00:58:16,246
Do say, what can we make?

755
00:58:16,288 --> 00:58:19,625
We can transfer the cell of fuel to another robot.

756
00:58:25,380 --> 00:58:27,257
It is this way.

757
00:58:27,299 --> 00:58:29,134
We can use it to her.

758
00:58:29,176 --> 00:58:32,137
It is a different cell, technology landlady.

759
00:58:32,679 --> 00:58:35,390
Where then?

760
00:58:35,432 --> 00:58:37,434
We run out of time!

761
00:58:37,476 --> 00:58:40,437
Susie is not the first android that I have created.

762
00:58:41,939 --> 00:58:46,318
She was the second.
Technically the third but...

763
00:58:50,322 --> 00:58:53,534
The first that I created were for the army.

764
00:58:54,743 --> 00:58:59,164
The plan was to create a machine
that it combatted to another machine.

765
00:58:59,456 --> 00:59:00,958
Stronger than any human.

766
00:59:00,999 --> 00:59:03,085
Full with anger...

767
00:59:03,126 --> 00:59:04,127
...without fears...

768
00:59:04,169 --> 00:59:07,130
As machine, it would be immune to a brain escan.

769
00:59:23,814 --> 00:59:26,775
I am a perfectionist.

770
00:59:28,610 --> 00:59:32,322
I have transformed into a human.

771
00:59:33,949 --> 00:59:41,039
I gave you the ability to feel, to want, to love...

772
00:59:42,875 --> 00:59:47,421
and the most important thing, I gave you the only one
I want that the machines don't possess,

773
00:59:49,173 --> 00:59:52,092
the hope.

774
00:59:56,263 --> 01:00:00,934
I have built a machine that has faith that he/she dreams.

775
01:00:06,023 --> 01:00:08,942
I always knew it.

776
01:00:09,860 --> 01:00:12,821
I always knew it.

777
01:00:13,322 --> 01:00:15,532
Of course.

778
01:00:15,574 --> 01:00:18,535
You know yourself.

779
01:00:18,702 --> 01:00:23,242
Nobody in the army questioned the fact
that you were the first human being...

780
01:00:23,343 --> 01:00:25,751
found in earth after 200 years.

781
01:00:26,585 --> 01:00:29,546
You assimilated the society perfectly.

782
01:00:29,630 --> 01:00:32,257
You tried to save our project.

783
01:00:32,299 --> 01:00:35,260
They no longer trusted more us.

784
01:00:36,345 --> 01:00:38,764
Make it.

785
01:00:38,805 --> 01:00:41,767
Surrender it.

786
01:00:43,060 --> 01:00:47,814
The transfer of the information
to the tower it will eliminate your cell.

787
01:00:49,942 --> 01:00:52,861
- You will die.
- Well.

788
01:00:52,903 --> 01:00:56,573
There is another way, we can create
another version of your memory.

789
01:00:56,907 --> 01:01:00,702
I have lived all my life like human, Dr.

790
01:01:02,538 --> 01:01:05,499
Allow me to die as such.

791
01:01:26,061 --> 01:01:29,022
The communications are operational.

792
01:01:29,398 --> 01:01:31,191
Go to their divisions.

793
01:01:31,233 --> 01:01:33,110
We will form soldiers' squadrons.

794
01:01:33,193 --> 01:01:34,444
- Severe...
- Sr.

795
01:01:34,486 --> 01:01:36,113
- He/she will comb.
- Yes, Sr.

796
01:01:36,154 --> 01:01:38,532
I will command the division.

797
01:01:38,574 --> 01:01:40,450
Very well.

798
01:01:40,492 --> 01:01:42,119
We Go, Dr.

799
01:01:42,160 --> 01:01:44,663
How? No, no...

800
01:01:44,705 --> 01:01:46,915
I would never leave.

801
01:01:46,915 --> 01:01:49,835
We go, you can bring to your girl. She will protect you.

802
01:01:50,961 --> 01:01:52,754
We need it.

803
01:01:52,796 --> 01:01:55,757
Not it can have any complication.

804
01:01:59,261 --> 01:02:02,222
I will give my things.

805
01:02:02,806 --> 01:02:05,726
I united the load transport to my hunt.

806
01:02:05,893 --> 01:02:08,187
But, I doubt that it can take it the whole time.

807
01:02:08,228 --> 01:02:11,190
- It is a beginning.
- Expert.

808
01:02:15,235 --> 01:02:18,197
If you look for for some inspiration type to speak...

809
01:02:18,906 --> 01:02:21,867
- Not I know about one.
- Or you don't need it.

810
01:02:25,954 --> 01:02:28,874
Maybe have 30 min.

811
01:02:28,916 --> 01:02:31,251
They have arrived to the green line.

812
01:02:31,293 --> 01:02:33,295
We should prove the eMag.

813
01:02:33,337 --> 01:02:36,215
It is everything.

814
01:02:36,256 --> 01:02:39,259
- If you don't leave in that time...
- Good luck.

815
01:02:41,970 --> 01:02:44,932
Thank you, to you also.

816
01:02:55,692 --> 01:02:58,654
Find it.

817
01:02:58,820 --> 01:03:01,782
I will make it.

818
01:03:03,575 --> 01:03:06,537
I equip Alpha! Ahead!

819
01:03:14,086 --> 01:03:17,047
- No, I am not able to.
- He/she will make it.

820
01:03:27,933 --> 01:03:30,894
Care to where it points.

821
01:03:33,897 --> 01:03:36,775
Delta, throws the whole squadron.

822
01:03:36,817 --> 01:03:39,778
Stay in closed formation.

823
01:04:29,661 --> 01:04:32,623
How do you see everything there?

824
01:04:39,379 --> 01:04:42,132
Concentrate on the big of the infantry.

825
01:04:42,174 --> 01:04:45,135
Try to stop the red ones.

826
01:04:45,802 --> 01:04:48,764
Try to delay them.

827
01:04:49,973 --> 01:04:52,935
Fire!

828
01:04:58,398 --> 01:05:02,152
Not they are shooting. Not we have
interferencía of plasm...

829
01:05:02,402 --> 01:05:05,280
of none of ours of positions.

830
01:05:05,322 --> 01:05:08,283
What are they waiting?

831
01:05:10,536 --> 01:05:13,914
It is a lot of weight. Not I will be able to take them until there.

832
01:05:13,997 --> 01:05:17,125
- Take us as close as you can.
- Copied.

833
01:05:19,044 --> 01:05:22,965
They are launching a total attack,
we should open the communications.

834
01:05:23,131 --> 01:05:25,342
But if not, we take a risk...

835
01:05:25,384 --> 01:05:30,013
Major, if they don't already know it, we should notice them.

836
01:05:34,434 --> 01:05:36,144
Calling to the Central Command.

837
01:05:36,186 --> 01:05:42,317
- Corrina? Are you well?
- Well

838
01:05:42,693 --> 01:05:45,696
They are throwing a massive offensive.

839
01:05:46,113 --> 01:05:50,117
- Yes, where are you?
- Fair in front of the tower.

840
01:05:50,742 --> 01:05:53,745
He/she waits.

841
01:05:57,499 --> 01:06:00,627
A.R.V is sending.

842
01:06:01,837 --> 01:06:03,881
Hundred.

843
01:06:03,922 --> 01:06:06,884
Good, stay there same.
We will send somebody there.

844
01:06:07,217 --> 01:06:13,849
Raphael. They are creating a perimeter
to fence us and to avoid that we escape.

845
01:06:13,974 --> 01:06:19,438
- The attack comes from the air.
- Copied.

846
01:06:21,565 --> 01:06:25,402
Aim the heavy armament toward the sky. Now.

847
01:06:27,905 --> 01:06:30,866
The whole prepared artillery for air imminent attack...

848
01:06:31,033 --> 01:06:34,661
load the canyons, throw them with all that we have.

849
01:06:34,745 --> 01:06:38,290
They are attacking from the air, I have to loose them, boys.

850
01:06:38,749 --> 01:06:40,250
Make what you have to make.

851
01:06:40,292 --> 01:06:43,253
Mitch!

852
01:06:45,839 --> 01:06:48,800
We take those.

853
01:06:49,218 --> 01:06:52,846
- Well.
- Do you know how to fly these things?

854
01:06:53,055 --> 01:06:56,141
He/she opens the floodgate.

855
01:07:09,571 --> 01:07:12,741
- Attack.
- We are already almost there.

856
01:07:14,701 --> 01:07:19,206
- They are shooting us.
- Return the fire!

857
01:07:23,418 --> 01:07:26,255
We knock down one.

858
01:07:26,296 --> 01:07:30,467
- They are coming closer.
- Mitch has to arrive to the tower, us not.

859
01:07:30,717 --> 01:07:33,679
- Follow me.
- Copied.

860
01:07:44,064 --> 01:07:47,651
Affirmative, we need air support.

861
01:07:48,944 --> 01:07:54,575
A.R.V attack. Take them out of the attack line.

862
01:07:55,200 --> 01:07:59,621
They listened to it, let us make sound these
machines and let us take them out of the battle field.

863
01:08:00,163 --> 01:08:02,249
Rand, takes to your squad to the gray line.

864
01:08:02,291 --> 01:08:04,918
Victor, you continue with me.

865
01:08:04,960 --> 01:08:07,921
We will light the sky.

866
01:08:13,844 --> 01:08:16,805
Here they come.

867
01:08:27,858 --> 01:08:30,777
I have one in my bottom.

868
01:08:31,028 --> 01:08:33,989
Not I can take off it of above.

869
01:08:34,823 --> 01:08:37,784
I have it.

870
01:08:40,913 --> 01:08:42,497
Thank You Rand.

871
01:08:42,539 --> 01:08:45,501
Of anything. Squadron Delta, follow my control.

872
01:08:49,505 --> 01:08:56,553
- Combat pattern 226.
- Copied, code Delta 226.

873
01:09:08,774 --> 01:09:12,319
They are coming closer. They are to
point of penetrating the perimeter.

874
01:09:12,778 --> 01:09:19,034
- Load those And-Mags in the western sector.
- That it is made this way.

875
01:09:35,676 --> 01:09:40,430
Federal agency, those And-Mags they are
loaded and clever to spread.

876
01:09:41,306 --> 01:09:45,018
Wait. we only have an opportunity with these.

877
01:09:45,936 --> 01:09:48,981
Cover all, we will explode those And-Mags.

878
01:10:06,707 --> 01:10:09,668
Take this, shit piece!

879
01:10:11,295 --> 01:10:14,256
- Calling to Mitch.
- Ahead.

880
01:10:14,339 --> 01:10:16,592
They have spread those And-Mags in the western sector...

881
01:10:16,633 --> 01:10:18,468
we don't have a lot of time.

882
01:10:18,510 --> 01:10:21,513
We are already almost there.

883
01:10:33,650 --> 01:10:37,237
- This won't be easy.
- There it is.

884
01:10:38,655 --> 01:10:41,200
This won't tolerate.

885
01:10:41,241 --> 01:10:44,995
- There, you see your first, I cover you.
- Copied.

886
01:11:21,698 --> 01:11:24,660
Where is she?

887
01:11:26,328 --> 01:11:29,289
Where is it?!

888
01:11:46,306 --> 01:11:50,519
All of foot! It is hour of the party.

889
01:11:52,729 --> 01:11:57,234
They are left without time. We have that
to arrive to the tower, there is not time to lose.

890
01:11:59,862 --> 01:12:03,532
- This world dies with her.
- He/she waits.

891
01:12:08,161 --> 01:12:12,207
- You are alive.
- I would not get lost this for anything of the world.

892
01:12:12,916 --> 01:12:17,462
Wait to that are inside
to fraternize, please.

893
01:12:18,630 --> 01:12:21,592
We go.

894
01:12:22,593 --> 01:12:25,554
They have penetrated the perimeter.

895
01:12:36,565 --> 01:12:39,526
Look for refuge.

896
01:12:50,037 --> 01:12:53,957
They have just discharged two And-Mags.
Not it shines well.

897
01:12:54,499 --> 01:12:55,751
Copied.

898
01:12:55,792 --> 01:13:01,256
We have to give them air more support.
Rand, takes this. Victor, you with me.

899
01:13:01,632 --> 01:13:02,841
Copied.

900
01:13:02,883 --> 01:13:07,721
Squadron, follow my ship.
Care with the crossed fire.

901
01:13:24,112 --> 01:13:26,949
Where is the Central Computer?

902
01:13:26,990 --> 01:13:29,952
I joust in front.

903
01:13:34,748 --> 01:13:36,959
They are shooting us.

904
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:41,046
- Is there another access doctor?
- I don't believe it

905
01:13:42,798 --> 01:13:44,466
Then we will fight until the end.

906
01:13:44,508 --> 01:13:50,472
Small, focus you in the right.
You are in charge of of the Left.

907
01:13:50,556 --> 01:13:53,559
I have it.

908
01:13:53,892 --> 01:13:56,812
They are many.

909
01:14:05,445 --> 01:14:07,197
What was that?

910
01:14:07,239 --> 01:14:10,200
I don't know it.

911
01:14:41,356 --> 01:14:46,195
All behind! Cover! Move!

912
01:14:51,158 --> 01:14:53,160
All the perimeters have penetrated.

913
01:14:53,202 --> 01:14:56,622
- Those And-Mags they have some effect?
- Minimum. They are coming closer.

914
01:14:58,749 --> 01:15:03,712
- Inícia the evacuation process.
- I list evacuation procedure.

915
01:15:04,046 --> 01:15:07,007
Waiting to be thrown.

916
01:15:14,097 --> 01:15:16,475
We have to eliminate to that can head.

917
01:15:16,517 --> 01:15:22,272
Victor! Victor! Victor!

918
01:15:22,689 --> 01:15:25,651
Curse!

919
01:15:29,363 --> 01:15:33,283
- Raphael, saves those And-Mags for the tower.
- Not I can tolerate more.

920
01:15:34,576 --> 01:15:40,040
It still tolerates all that you can, the team this inside.

921
01:15:40,332 --> 01:15:43,252
I repeat, the team is still inside.

922
01:15:54,596 --> 01:15:57,558
Waiting the attack order.

923
01:16:00,602 --> 01:16:02,563
They have left.

924
01:16:02,604 --> 01:16:05,566
We go then.

925
01:16:14,491 --> 01:16:17,452
- Are you well?
- Well.

926
01:16:18,745 --> 01:16:22,833
- It is a good damned against-measure.
- I suppose.

927
01:16:23,834 --> 01:16:26,503
We need a grenade, or something explosive.

928
01:16:26,545 --> 01:16:29,506
I have the feeling that that will be difficult.

929
01:16:37,264 --> 01:16:42,186
It is biological, a biological scanner,
not detecting of movement.

930
01:16:42,227 --> 01:16:45,522
- It is before, behind that door.
- I will go.

931
01:16:45,564 --> 01:16:49,651
- What?
- Veto to a sure place.

932
01:16:49,943 --> 01:16:52,905
Salt of here before they fly this place completely.

933
01:16:54,114 --> 01:16:55,616
You will die.

934
01:16:55,657 --> 01:16:58,619
- Make sure that she comes out of here.
- Sure boss.

935
01:16:59,870 --> 01:17:02,831
- Not make this.
- It is the only form.

936
01:17:03,207 --> 01:17:06,168
It has always been the only form.

937
01:17:11,673 --> 01:17:13,884
You know that I have always loved you.

938
01:17:13,926 --> 01:17:16,887
And I will always make it.

939
01:17:26,647 --> 01:17:30,484
I sit down it. I sit down it so much.

940
01:17:31,235 --> 01:17:34,196
Not I came here for an excuse.

941
01:18:38,677 --> 01:18:41,638
Not I can tolerate them for more time.

942
01:18:43,265 --> 01:18:46,226
Arm it.

943
01:18:48,145 --> 01:18:50,147
10...

944
01:18:50,189 --> 01:18:53,108
9... 8...

945
01:19:11,668 --> 01:19:16,882
5... 4... 3...

946
01:19:22,679 --> 01:19:25,641
Disconnect those And-Mags!
