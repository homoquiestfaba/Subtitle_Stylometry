00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:03,871
<i>Hello, Lizzy.</i>

2
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:06,406
Hi, dad.

3
00:05:07,608 --> 00:05:09,844
My show opens Monday.

4
00:05:09,877 --> 00:05:12,780
That's a week from tomorrow.
Put it on your calendar.

5
00:05:12,814 --> 00:05:15,683
<i>Well, I don't think</i>
<i>I got an invitation.</i>

6
00:05:15,716 --> 00:05:17,484
<i>Unless it got lost</i>
<i>in the junk mail.</i>

7
00:05:17,518 --> 00:05:20,087
<i>So much junk mail</i>
<i>coming in all the time.</i>

8
00:05:20,121 --> 00:05:23,758
<i>Have you seen the fake</i>
<i>handwriting they have now?</i>

9
00:05:23,791 --> 00:05:25,827
<i>Looks like someone</i>
<i>really wrote it by hand.</i>

10
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:27,995
Dad, this is your invitation.

11
00:05:28,029 --> 00:05:30,131
I haven't had time
to send anything out.

12
00:05:30,164 --> 00:05:32,365
<i>Uh, well, we'll all be there.</i>

13
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:34,769
<i>My guests have come</i>
<i>wandering through again.</i>

14
00:05:34,802 --> 00:05:37,470
<i>They'd love to have an outing,</i>
<i>I'm sure.</i>

15
00:05:37,505 --> 00:05:39,439
I don't like that they're
staying with you again.

16
00:05:39,472 --> 00:05:40,473
<i>They like it here.</i>

17
00:05:40,508 --> 00:05:42,409
<i>It's a good spot</i>
<i>for them to stop.</i>

18
00:05:42,442 --> 00:05:43,744
They were just there.

19
00:05:43,778 --> 00:05:45,813
Don't they have anywhere else
they can stay?

20
00:05:46,781 --> 00:05:48,683
<i>I enjoy the company.</i>

21
00:05:50,751 --> 00:05:52,954
Feels like they're
taking advantage of you.

22
00:05:52,987 --> 00:05:55,056
<i>No. No. No.</i>

23
00:05:56,489 --> 00:05:57,758
I'm gonna stop by this week
and make sure

24
00:05:57,792 --> 00:06:00,493
they don't have you
tied up in the basement.

25
00:06:00,528 --> 00:06:04,065
<i>Nothing as exciting as that,</i>
<i>I assure you.</i>

26
00:06:04,098 --> 00:06:07,467
<i>Though that would</i>
<i>possibly be quite enjoyable.</i>

27
00:06:07,501 --> 00:06:08,970
<i>I could do without</i>
<i>their dog though,</i>

28
00:06:09,003 --> 00:06:11,105
<i>not a well-trained creature.</i>

29
00:06:11,138 --> 00:06:14,075
<i>Keeps mistaking the corner</i>
<i>of my couch for a tree.</i>

30
00:06:14,108 --> 00:06:15,643
Dad, that's gross.

31
00:07:38,025 --> 00:07:40,861
Hey Lizzy. Check it out.

32
00:07:43,197 --> 00:07:44,231
Been hoping to find

33
00:07:44,265 --> 00:07:46,734
a good tire for this tree
for ages.

34
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:52,506
Jo, the water situation
is getting worse.

35
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:53,808
Barely gets lukewarm now.

36
00:07:53,841 --> 00:07:56,677
Just a few minutes of lukewarm
and then cold.

37
00:07:57,945 --> 00:07:59,747
That sounds serious.

38
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:04,151
I'm on it.

39
00:08:07,555 --> 00:08:09,657
Just got to get
through this week first.

40
00:08:13,661 --> 00:08:14,996
Shouldn't even be here
right now.

41
00:08:15,029 --> 00:08:16,130
I've got so much to do.

42
00:08:16,163 --> 00:08:18,099
I do, too. And I don't know
what I'm supposed to do

43
00:08:18,132 --> 00:08:19,533
without hot water.

44
00:08:21,168 --> 00:08:24,538
Lizzy, I told you,
you can use my shower.

45
00:08:26,841 --> 00:08:28,876
I want my own water working.

46
00:08:30,978 --> 00:08:32,613
My show's open on Friday.

47
00:08:32,646 --> 00:08:34,949
I'll be free to deal with it
after that.

48
00:08:34,982 --> 00:08:36,784
I have a show too, you know.
I'm just...

49
00:08:39,253 --> 00:08:41,689
You're not the only one
with a deadline.

50
00:08:42,823 --> 00:08:46,160
I know, but I have two shows
which is insane.

51
00:08:57,738 --> 00:08:59,273
Hey! Give me a push.

52
00:09:07,715 --> 00:09:09,250
You're hungry?

53
00:09:11,118 --> 00:09:12,887
Well, you have to wait.
You're out of food.

54
00:09:13,954 --> 00:09:15,856
I have to work.

55
00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:18,993
I'll go to the store later.

56
00:09:19,026 --> 00:09:20,861
Fine.

57
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:21,762
Ugh, shut up!

58
00:09:21,796 --> 00:09:24,965
God, Ricky,
you're ruining my workday.

59
00:11:21,248 --> 00:11:22,383
<i>This is Todd-a-phonic time.</i>

60
00:11:22,416 --> 00:11:24,118
<i>Happy Monday to you all.</i>

61
00:11:24,151 --> 00:11:26,353
<i>Counting the days</i>
<i>until the Quazi show</i>

62
00:11:26,387 --> 00:11:27,388
<i>on the roof of the...</i>

63
00:11:46,407 --> 00:11:47,441
Eric!

64
00:11:49,043 --> 00:11:50,512
Hey!

65
00:11:50,545 --> 00:11:52,947
A whole year of my life.

66
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:54,014
Let's see it.

67
00:12:04,858 --> 00:12:07,461
I love it.

68
00:12:07,494 --> 00:12:09,029
What did you end up
doing with the zipper?

69
00:12:09,063 --> 00:12:12,166
Well, I abandoned
the zipper idea

70
00:12:12,199 --> 00:12:14,034
and went with Velcro.

71
00:12:14,068 --> 00:12:16,870
Which, like you said,
is not great...

72
00:12:16,904 --> 00:12:17,938
Come here, let me help.

73
00:12:17,972 --> 00:12:18,906
...because it sticks
to the yarn.

74
00:12:18,939 --> 00:12:20,841
Yeah, it gets
a little messy, but...

75
00:12:26,213 --> 00:12:27,281
Hey, Lizzy, can I get

76
00:12:27,314 --> 00:12:28,916
a little bit
of coffee, please?

77
00:12:28,949 --> 00:12:31,218
This isn't a cafeteria.

78
00:12:31,252 --> 00:12:32,820
Okay, but, like...

79
00:12:32,853 --> 00:12:35,055
Could you at least tell me
who's on my board?

80
00:12:36,056 --> 00:12:38,526
Hasn't been decided yet.

81
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,562
Look, Randal,
he shouldn't be on my board.

82
00:12:40,595 --> 00:12:41,829
We don't see eye-to-eye.

83
00:12:41,862 --> 00:12:43,330
We got, like,
different theories

84
00:12:43,364 --> 00:12:44,298
of cultural production.

85
00:12:44,331 --> 00:12:48,102
Or he just doesn't like me.
I don't know.

86
00:12:48,135 --> 00:12:49,970
I'm just putting that
out there.

87
00:12:52,239 --> 00:12:54,008
- Hey, man...
- Hey.

88
00:13:00,414 --> 00:13:02,783
Big piece on Marlene Heyman.

89
00:13:06,854 --> 00:13:11,058
"...devotional, humble,
luminous and strange..."

90
00:13:11,091 --> 00:13:13,427
"She sees glass
as a religious vessel

91
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:16,230
"for personal
mastic meditation."

92
00:13:17,364 --> 00:13:21,435
Wow, major real estate.

93
00:13:21,468 --> 00:13:23,170
"The dream like glass
would seem like..."

94
00:13:24,305 --> 00:13:25,507
Lizzy.

95
00:13:27,408 --> 00:13:29,410
Uh, let's get
the, uh, latest, um,

96
00:13:29,443 --> 00:13:31,879
end-of-year schedule
out today.

97
00:13:39,353 --> 00:13:40,354
Mmm.

98
00:13:42,489 --> 00:13:46,594
Oh, these are travel receipts
for our guests.

99
00:13:46,628 --> 00:13:49,296
And, um,
I gave Tim Hunter cash

100
00:13:49,330 --> 00:13:52,066
so the invoice is in there.

101
00:14:08,349 --> 00:14:09,551
Here you go.

102
00:14:11,452 --> 00:14:12,520
All right.

103
00:14:26,033 --> 00:14:28,335
Lizzy, you ready
to fire this week?

104
00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:33,340
Yeah, yeah.

105
00:14:33,374 --> 00:14:36,143
There'll be a few stragglers
though, is that okay?

106
00:14:36,176 --> 00:14:38,078
We'll make room.
Just bring by what you have.

107
00:14:38,112 --> 00:14:40,314
It's all right.
We'll make it work.

108
00:14:40,347 --> 00:14:43,917
Oh, I saw some of Jo's work
at her studio yesterday.

109
00:14:43,951 --> 00:14:46,186
Wow, it just gives me
such a lift.

110
00:14:47,087 --> 00:14:48,556
Pretty amazing.

111
00:14:51,325 --> 00:14:52,359
She'd be more amazing

112
00:14:52,393 --> 00:14:53,661
if she got
my hot water working.

113
00:14:55,597 --> 00:14:57,565
Two weeks now.

114
00:14:57,599 --> 00:14:59,601
Hey, Lizzy,
I've gotta get to class.

115
00:14:59,634 --> 00:15:01,902
Bring your stuff by.
We'll make it work.

116
00:15:37,237 --> 00:15:39,006
He's on
spherical mirrors...

117
00:15:40,107 --> 00:15:42,610
...groovy oil lamps.

118
00:15:44,445 --> 00:15:48,382
Media heat.
The heat of the technology.

119
00:15:48,415 --> 00:15:50,417
The human shadows.

120
00:15:51,185 --> 00:15:53,521
This mess of images.

121
00:15:55,088 --> 00:15:57,157
So, what does it all do?

122
00:16:00,795 --> 00:16:02,630
It blows our minds.

123
00:16:04,198 --> 00:16:06,768
Does somebody wanna go
on the inside?

124
00:16:06,801 --> 00:16:08,703
Grace? Maya?

125
00:16:18,746 --> 00:16:20,414
I'm not gonna lock you in.

126
00:16:23,718 --> 00:16:27,120
This one,
doesn't make me cringe.

127
00:16:29,356 --> 00:16:31,091
I had a special feeling
about this one.

128
00:16:31,124 --> 00:16:32,727
You know, it's, uh,

129
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:35,630
it's right where
I wanted to be.

130
00:16:35,663 --> 00:16:40,267
Good form, but not too slick.

131
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:45,038
There's spontaneity
in that pot.

132
00:16:46,139 --> 00:16:47,307
It's its own thing.

133
00:16:57,284 --> 00:16:58,686
You know you're meeting
with the dean at noon?

134
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:02,524
-Yeah. Can you remind Jackie?
-She knows.

135
00:17:02,557 --> 00:17:04,191
And I was wondering
if it's okay

136
00:17:04,224 --> 00:17:06,460
if I take tomorrow off work?

137
00:17:06,493 --> 00:17:08,228
I was thinking
I might do that.

138
00:17:09,196 --> 00:17:10,297
I'd have a lot of work.

139
00:17:10,330 --> 00:17:11,431
For the show.

140
00:17:17,404 --> 00:17:19,039
So is that okay?

141
00:17:19,641 --> 00:17:21,241
If I don't come in?

142
00:17:21,275 --> 00:17:22,844
Lizzy, if you're taking
a personal day,

143
00:17:22,877 --> 00:17:24,779
you're taking a personal day.

144
00:17:24,812 --> 00:17:25,847
Okay, so I won't
be in tomorrow.

145
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:27,080
I got it.

146
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,522
And have you talked to Dad?

147
00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:38,458
Because those people are back
at his house again.

148
00:17:38,492 --> 00:17:40,127
What people?

149
00:17:41,529 --> 00:17:43,665
The people who stay with him.

150
00:17:43,698 --> 00:17:45,867
Well, your father
is living his own life.

151
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:48,268
And we all wish him
the very best.

152
00:17:48,302 --> 00:17:50,470
Lizzy, I'm focusing here.

153
00:18:36,951 --> 00:18:39,453
I can't figure out
what class this is.

154
00:18:40,354 --> 00:18:42,557
But I really want to join it.

155
00:18:46,527 --> 00:18:48,195
Thinking and Movement.

156
00:18:48,228 --> 00:18:49,463
Ah.

157
00:18:50,665 --> 00:18:52,432
You're Lizzy, right?

158
00:18:52,466 --> 00:18:54,468
You made that nice flyer.

159
00:18:59,707 --> 00:19:01,274
I haven't gotten
to read the article yet,

160
00:19:01,308 --> 00:19:02,677
but I made the flyer.

161
00:19:05,647 --> 00:19:06,814
Cool.

162
00:19:07,682 --> 00:19:09,917
Well, thank you.

163
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:12,386
I want to impress
those students.

164
00:19:14,689 --> 00:19:16,891
And the flyer was very nice.

165
00:19:20,662 --> 00:19:22,329
Thank you.

166
00:19:22,362 --> 00:19:23,765
Yeah, see you around.

167
00:19:37,612 --> 00:19:41,448
<i>...in store for us</i>
<i>and I can't wait to listen.</i>

168
00:19:41,481 --> 00:19:43,851
<i>But while I wait to listen,</i>
<i>let's listen to...</i>

169
00:19:45,687 --> 00:19:47,354
<i>This is, like, the, uh...</i>

170
00:19:47,387 --> 00:19:50,892
<i>Mike Bloomfield,</i>
<i>Al Kooper super session...</i>

171
00:22:27,014 --> 00:22:28,916
<i>Hey, you,</i>
<i>leave a message.</i>

172
00:22:31,786 --> 00:22:33,754
Hey, Sean, checking in.

173
00:22:36,858 --> 00:22:39,727
My show opens on Monday.
It's at Lauren's again.

174
00:22:42,029 --> 00:22:44,031
If you're not busy
maybe you'll come.

175
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,635
Okay. Well...

176
00:22:48,703 --> 00:22:49,937
Talk to you later.

177
00:22:50,838 --> 00:22:52,039
Bye.

178
00:23:56,737 --> 00:23:57,872
Hey.

179
00:23:58,172 --> 00:23:59,173
Hey.

180
00:24:03,177 --> 00:24:04,779
They said they were doing
a catalogue

181
00:24:04,812 --> 00:24:05,746
and now they're like,

182
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:08,983
"Oh, it won't be ready
before the opening."

183
00:24:09,016 --> 00:24:11,719
Only our school
would do that. God.

184
00:24:11,752 --> 00:24:14,622
- Lame.
- So lame.

185
00:24:14,655 --> 00:24:17,591
Abigail Firschein
spotlight show.

186
00:24:17,625 --> 00:24:18,491
If there's no catalogue,

187
00:24:18,526 --> 00:24:20,828
it's just my thesis show
all over again.

188
00:24:21,529 --> 00:24:22,462
Who cares?

189
00:24:22,495 --> 00:24:25,099
It'll happen.
Things usually get done,

190
00:24:25,132 --> 00:24:28,536
just not on time.

191
00:24:32,306 --> 00:24:33,708
Yeah, we'll see.

192
00:26:00,928 --> 00:26:02,363
Oh, no. Ricky! Ricky! Ricky!

193
00:26:02,396 --> 00:26:04,098
Ricky! No. No.

194
00:26:04,131 --> 00:26:05,299
No! Bad cat!

195
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:07,168
Ricky! Ricky!

196
00:26:07,201 --> 00:26:09,970
Bad cat, bad cat. Get out.

197
00:26:12,139 --> 00:26:13,274
Shit.

198
00:26:15,876 --> 00:26:17,011
Oh...

199
00:26:23,784 --> 00:26:26,187
Oh, you dumb bird.

200
00:26:28,222 --> 00:26:29,323
Ooh...

201
00:26:35,930 --> 00:26:38,232
Off you go.

202
00:26:38,265 --> 00:26:41,635
Go somewhere else.
Go die somewhere else.

203
00:26:50,177 --> 00:26:51,612
Jesus, I'm bad.

204
00:26:53,247 --> 00:26:54,748
Ricky, you are bad!

205
00:26:55,316 --> 00:26:56,317
Bad.

206
00:27:30,951 --> 00:27:32,119
Shit.

207
00:27:59,313 --> 00:28:00,447
Lizzy.

208
00:28:01,516 --> 00:28:02,850
Check it out.

209
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:07,087
Found this poor bird.

210
00:28:08,455 --> 00:28:09,690
What?

211
00:28:10,791 --> 00:28:12,860
I found a bird. Check it out.

212
00:28:18,866 --> 00:28:21,168
Hey... Yeah...

213
00:28:22,002 --> 00:28:24,071
We're good. You're good.

214
00:28:25,806 --> 00:28:27,474
Oh, a pigeon.

215
00:28:27,509 --> 00:28:29,710
I think it was mauled
by a cat.

216
00:28:31,312 --> 00:28:35,149
It was flapping around
out back in the flowerbed.

217
00:28:35,182 --> 00:28:37,918
His wing is messed up.
Broken, I think.

218
00:28:38,852 --> 00:28:40,522
Poor little guy.

219
00:28:40,555 --> 00:28:42,089
Look at this guy.

220
00:28:43,891 --> 00:28:45,226
You're okay...

221
00:28:46,493 --> 00:28:48,128
Hold him a sec.

222
00:28:57,371 --> 00:28:59,240
I think it was Oscar
who did it.

223
00:29:02,977 --> 00:29:04,245
That cat is a menace.

224
00:29:04,278 --> 00:29:06,247
They really need
to keep him inside.

225
00:29:17,157 --> 00:29:18,526
Come on,
let's fix this guy up.

226
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:19,760
Jo...

227
00:29:30,271 --> 00:29:32,039
I think this should be good.

228
00:29:33,407 --> 00:29:34,408
Yeah.

229
00:29:34,875 --> 00:29:35,876
Okay.

230
00:29:38,979 --> 00:29:40,414
Okay...

231
00:29:49,957 --> 00:29:51,225
Does that look good?

232
00:29:52,627 --> 00:29:54,061
I think so.

233
00:29:56,430 --> 00:29:57,998
Okay, we need a box.

234
00:30:12,246 --> 00:30:13,447
Okay... Wait.

235
00:30:22,524 --> 00:30:23,857
Okay.

236
00:30:26,193 --> 00:30:27,261
All right.

237
00:30:36,070 --> 00:30:37,905
Ah, the People Tower.

238
00:30:37,938 --> 00:30:40,040
I probably made
this Freshman year.

239
00:30:41,275 --> 00:30:42,943
That's a classic.

240
00:30:57,692 --> 00:30:59,093
Okay...

241
00:31:00,094 --> 00:31:01,563
There you go.

242
00:31:04,164 --> 00:31:05,399
Perfecto!

243
00:31:11,472 --> 00:31:13,508
What are we gonna
do with you, huh?

244
00:31:16,343 --> 00:31:19,213
What are we gonna do?

245
00:31:20,682 --> 00:31:22,015
I gotta get to work.

246
00:31:22,049 --> 00:31:23,917
Hey, Lizzy,
what are you doing today?

247
00:31:23,951 --> 00:31:25,687
Me?

248
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:28,155
Working in the studio
from home. I got a lot to do.

249
00:31:28,188 --> 00:31:30,558
I have to install
at Nationale.

250
00:31:31,325 --> 00:31:32,560
Jo, I have a cat.

251
00:31:34,729 --> 00:31:35,630
Ricky is upstairs,

252
00:31:35,663 --> 00:31:38,399
the bird can hang with you
in the studio.

253
00:31:39,199 --> 00:31:40,501
I took today off to work.

254
00:31:40,535 --> 00:31:42,604
Aw, this guy is no trouble.

255
00:31:43,270 --> 00:31:44,304
Right?

256
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:47,474
Yeah, I guess.

257
00:31:47,509 --> 00:31:51,111
Wow, super! You're amazing.

258
00:31:51,145 --> 00:31:54,281
I'll get him back from you
as soon as I get home.

259
00:31:54,314 --> 00:31:55,583
You're the best.

260
00:31:55,617 --> 00:31:56,618
Okay.

261
00:32:04,526 --> 00:32:05,993
Oh, yeah,

262
00:32:06,026 --> 00:32:07,695
you've done enough already.

263
00:33:16,698 --> 00:33:18,031
Sorry.

264
00:36:17,512 --> 00:36:18,713
Gross.

265
00:37:05,793 --> 00:37:07,227
What's the matter?

266
00:37:11,065 --> 00:37:12,600
Why are you panting?

267
00:37:35,957 --> 00:37:37,792
<i>Hey, it's Jo. Leave a message.</i>

268
00:37:39,459 --> 00:37:42,362
Hi, Jo,
your bird is acting weird.

269
00:37:43,965 --> 00:37:45,767
I don't think
it's breathing right.

270
00:37:47,001 --> 00:37:48,335
Call me back.

271
00:37:56,511 --> 00:37:58,646
What, are you having
a heart attack or something?

272
00:38:15,930 --> 00:38:19,499
So much to do today, Mr. Bird,
you're not helping.

273
00:39:06,614 --> 00:39:08,716
<i>Jo, your bird</i>
<i>is acting weird.</i>

274
00:39:09,851 --> 00:39:11,686
<i>I don't think</i>
<i>it's breathing right.</i>

275
00:39:13,588 --> 00:39:14,722
<i>Call me back.</i>

276
00:39:28,002 --> 00:39:31,873
Looks like somebody did
a good job with the bandaging.

277
00:39:31,906 --> 00:39:33,107
What about
the heavy breathing?

278
00:39:34,542 --> 00:39:36,010
He's a little stressed.

279
00:39:37,578 --> 00:39:39,714
I'm not going to bother him.

280
00:39:39,747 --> 00:39:41,148
Have you been
keeping him warm?

281
00:39:41,182 --> 00:39:43,084
Birds like to be kept warm.

282
00:39:43,117 --> 00:39:46,554
I work in a garage studio.
It's not cold.

283
00:39:46,587 --> 00:39:48,522
It stays cool, but...

284
00:39:50,490 --> 00:39:53,127
I've been glazing down there,
but that's not too stinky.

285
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:56,931
Well, maybe the studio
is not the best place.

286
00:39:56,964 --> 00:39:59,734
You could put
a hot water bottle in the box.

287
00:39:59,767 --> 00:40:01,102
Uh, do you have one?

288
00:40:02,703 --> 00:40:04,772
Get one at the drug store.
Fill it with hot water.

289
00:40:04,805 --> 00:40:08,042
No hot water at my place.
Going on two weeks now.

290
00:40:08,075 --> 00:40:09,476
Do you have a stove?

291
00:40:10,745 --> 00:40:12,580
I have a stove.

292
00:40:12,613 --> 00:40:15,448
Heat some water
in a kettle or a pot,

293
00:40:15,482 --> 00:40:16,617
just wrap it in a towel.

294
00:40:16,651 --> 00:40:17,852
You don't want it too hot,

295
00:40:17,885 --> 00:40:19,486
but comfortable.

296
00:40:20,554 --> 00:40:21,656
That's all?

297
00:40:22,590 --> 00:40:23,925
It's a pigeon.

298
00:41:39,266 --> 00:41:40,768
I owe you some beers.

299
00:42:42,229 --> 00:42:43,597
Hi. How's the bird?

300
00:42:48,736 --> 00:42:51,639
Cost $150.

301
00:42:51,672 --> 00:42:55,176
I put it on my credit card.
I need to be paid back.

302
00:42:55,209 --> 00:43:00,648
A hundred and fifty dollars?
Wow, what'd they do to him?

303
00:43:00,681 --> 00:43:01,816
It's my one
big day for working

304
00:43:01,849 --> 00:43:05,152
and it got totally screwed up
taking care of your bird.

305
00:43:05,986 --> 00:43:07,988
I'm sorry about the day.

306
00:43:09,090 --> 00:43:11,926
You can take the money
off the rent.

307
00:43:11,959 --> 00:43:13,727
Doesn't get me back
the time.

308
00:43:17,932 --> 00:43:19,133
She's amazing.

309
00:43:22,203 --> 00:43:24,271
Love the green stockings.

310
00:43:25,005 --> 00:43:26,340
So cool.

311
00:43:27,908 --> 00:43:29,009
Awesome.

312
00:43:34,248 --> 00:43:38,853
Anything else
I should know? About the bird?

313
00:43:38,886 --> 00:43:42,323
I got some bird seed.
$3.99.

314
00:43:45,025 --> 00:43:48,195
Okay.
Thanks for taking care of him.

315
00:43:50,097 --> 00:43:51,732
Come on, <i>petit oiseau.</i>

316
00:43:51,765 --> 00:43:52,800
You're coming over
to my place.

317
00:43:52,833 --> 00:43:54,368
We'll have a nice time.

318
00:43:54,401 --> 00:43:56,070
Say bye to Lizzy.

319
00:43:56,103 --> 00:43:58,205
Bye bye, Lizzy.

320
00:43:58,973 --> 00:44:00,641
Bye, Lizzy.

321
00:44:25,833 --> 00:44:27,168
Good move getting here early.

322
00:44:28,169 --> 00:44:29,403
You got your own kiln.

323
00:44:29,436 --> 00:44:31,038
I had to pull an all-nighter.

324
00:44:34,308 --> 00:44:36,010
All right...

325
00:44:43,817 --> 00:44:45,753
You can take them up
to cone six.

326
00:44:47,087 --> 00:44:48,088
Cone six.

327
00:45:01,335 --> 00:45:02,469
She's great.

328
00:45:09,977 --> 00:45:11,745
Maybe soak them a while.

329
00:45:12,947 --> 00:45:14,048
Okay.

330
00:45:14,982 --> 00:45:16,383
I can do that.

331
00:45:20,020 --> 00:45:21,822
How many more pieces
we got coming?

332
00:45:22,923 --> 00:45:25,893
Uh, just one.
I'm almost there.

333
00:45:26,794 --> 00:45:29,330
Okay.
Be quick with it.

334
00:45:56,323 --> 00:45:57,491
Great framing...

335
00:46:31,959 --> 00:46:33,260
How's the bird?

336
00:46:36,864 --> 00:46:38,165
Seems all right.

337
00:46:38,999 --> 00:46:40,267
Got him over by the window.

338
00:47:04,458 --> 00:47:06,026
I'm gonna take him
to the office.

339
00:47:06,060 --> 00:47:07,194
It's loud in here.

340
00:47:07,928 --> 00:47:09,096
Okay.

341
00:47:48,335 --> 00:47:49,336
What's this?

342
00:47:50,037 --> 00:47:51,071
A bird.

343
00:47:52,072 --> 00:47:53,140
That's a pigeon.

344
00:47:55,309 --> 00:47:58,078
Adorable. What happened?

345
00:47:58,112 --> 00:47:59,346
Jo found it.

346
00:48:00,381 --> 00:48:02,584
The vet thinks
it has a broken wing

347
00:48:02,617 --> 00:48:04,017
and is stressed out.

348
00:48:04,686 --> 00:48:06,186
What's this?

349
00:48:07,121 --> 00:48:08,922
Something Ned Halter ordered.

350
00:48:08,956 --> 00:48:10,391
Well, it looks personal.

351
00:48:10,424 --> 00:48:13,394
Tell Ned he can pick it up
in my office.

352
00:48:15,095 --> 00:48:17,231
You took a pigeon to a vet?

353
00:48:17,264 --> 00:48:19,500
Now that's crazy.

354
00:48:19,534 --> 00:48:22,002
Okay, go, thank you.
You're off duty.

355
00:48:22,035 --> 00:48:23,538
Miss, I'm from Tacoma.

356
00:48:23,571 --> 00:48:26,508
We shoot pigeons with BB guns.
We don't take them to the vet.

357
00:48:32,012 --> 00:48:34,181
Yo, Lizzy took a pigeon
to the vet.

358
00:48:34,214 --> 00:48:36,116
She thinks the pigeon
is stressed out.

359
00:48:56,036 --> 00:48:57,304
Before he journeyed...

360
00:48:57,337 --> 00:49:00,107
...in his spaceship
to the Moon in 1971,

361
00:49:00,140 --> 00:49:01,442
Starfield astronaut
Allan Shepard

362
00:49:01,475 --> 00:49:02,976
didn't think he'd be...

363
00:49:03,611 --> 00:49:05,613
Hey, kiddo.

364
00:49:05,647 --> 00:49:08,182
-For you.
-Ooh, thank you come in.

365
00:49:08,215 --> 00:49:12,085
My captors are dying
to meet you.

366
00:49:12,119 --> 00:49:16,624
Lee, Dorothy,
my daughter, Lizzy.

367
00:49:16,658 --> 00:49:21,328
So, this is Lizzy!
Wonderful to meet you.

368
00:49:21,361 --> 00:49:25,733
We've heard all about you.

369
00:49:25,767 --> 00:49:29,269
Dorothy and Lee have
just come down from Canada.

370
00:49:29,303 --> 00:49:34,274
Yeah, we were standing
in the gardens of Victoria.

371
00:49:34,308 --> 00:49:35,342
Last week?

372
00:49:37,244 --> 00:49:39,747
-So beautiful.
-Really beautiful.

373
00:49:40,414 --> 00:49:41,516
Have you been?

374
00:49:42,282 --> 00:49:43,417
No.

375
00:49:43,450 --> 00:49:44,786
Yes, you have.

376
00:49:44,819 --> 00:49:47,154
You were there
when you were little.

377
00:49:47,187 --> 00:49:50,224
Oh, okay.
Well, yes, then.

378
00:49:54,194 --> 00:49:56,163
Well, <i>excusez-moi.</i>

379
00:49:56,196 --> 00:49:58,365
I must go to the toilette.

380
00:49:58,398 --> 00:50:00,234
Oh, Bill, shall Lee
make some coffee?

381
00:50:00,267 --> 00:50:02,369
Knock yourself out,
my dear.

382
00:50:04,304 --> 00:50:06,574
You're about out of coffee
by the way.

383
00:50:06,608 --> 00:50:09,443
And we're running low
on 1% milk,

384
00:50:09,476 --> 00:50:10,410
if we're making a list.

385
00:50:10,444 --> 00:50:12,079
Oh, that's your
middle of the night

386
00:50:12,112 --> 00:50:13,213
cereal eating.

387
00:50:13,247 --> 00:50:15,148
Well, she's got me there.

388
00:50:36,470 --> 00:50:38,272
Dad, how long
are they staying?

389
00:50:38,305 --> 00:50:40,140
Oh, I don't know.

390
00:50:40,173 --> 00:50:41,609
Well, where do
they live anyway?

391
00:50:41,643 --> 00:50:45,580
They winter in Mexico
and summer in Canada,

392
00:50:45,613 --> 00:50:47,247
they're very free.

393
00:51:04,331 --> 00:51:07,100
Mom says "Hi", by the way.

394
00:51:07,134 --> 00:51:10,070
Oh, really?
Well, "Hello" in return.

395
00:51:11,673 --> 00:51:13,206
How's your show shaping up?

396
00:51:14,742 --> 00:51:15,777
Great.

397
00:51:17,812 --> 00:51:21,281
Oh, that's wonderful.
Wonderful.

398
00:51:36,463 --> 00:51:38,633
If you see anything you like
that you want,

399
00:51:38,666 --> 00:51:40,200
by all means, just take it.

400
00:51:43,270 --> 00:51:44,706
You should make more
like this.

401
00:51:46,708 --> 00:51:48,408
I'm enjoying my retirement.

402
00:51:51,244 --> 00:51:52,513
I don't believe you.

403
00:51:52,547 --> 00:51:54,147
Well, it's true.

404
00:51:55,917 --> 00:51:57,585
Well, you should do it anyway.

405
00:51:57,619 --> 00:51:59,353
Nah, my days are full.

406
00:51:59,386 --> 00:52:00,521
I get up,

407
00:52:00,555 --> 00:52:02,422
I do a little of this,
a little of that,

408
00:52:02,456 --> 00:52:04,191
and before you know it,

409
00:52:04,224 --> 00:52:05,827
it's time to watch TV again.

410
00:52:05,860 --> 00:52:07,629
That sounds terrible.

411
00:52:07,662 --> 00:52:09,396
That suits me just fine.

412
00:52:11,231 --> 00:52:12,399
I can't find it.

413
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:15,502
I put it aside, but, um,

414
00:52:15,536 --> 00:52:17,772
must just got up
and walked away.

415
00:52:17,805 --> 00:52:19,406
Come on, let's go
join our friends again.

416
00:52:19,439 --> 00:52:20,474
Dad, those aren't
your friends.

417
00:52:20,508 --> 00:52:21,643
You barely know those people.

418
00:52:21,676 --> 00:52:23,176
Well, look at you.

419
00:52:27,414 --> 00:52:29,149
You've been there
all the time.

420
00:52:31,552 --> 00:52:32,920
Here, would you, uh, give this
to your brother

421
00:52:32,954 --> 00:52:34,254
when you see him again?

422
00:52:38,492 --> 00:52:41,328
For five years,
he lived in that jacket.

423
00:52:41,361 --> 00:52:43,731
I mean, it was mine,
but he took possession.

424
00:52:44,866 --> 00:52:46,901
He might like it again.

425
00:52:46,934 --> 00:52:49,336
-Yeah, I remember this.
-Yeah...

426
00:52:49,369 --> 00:52:50,404
Have you talked to Sean?

427
00:52:50,437 --> 00:52:51,706
I talk to him all the time.

428
00:52:51,739 --> 00:52:52,607
-C'mon, let's go...
-When's...

429
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:54,307
When's the last time
you talked to him?

430
00:52:54,341 --> 00:52:57,912
He brought a delicious
stuffing for Thanksgiving.

431
00:52:57,945 --> 00:52:59,479
It was ravishing. Let's go.

432
00:52:59,514 --> 00:53:02,817
Dad...
Dad, that was six months ago.

433
00:53:02,850 --> 00:53:04,519
Well, he was great
six months ago.

434
00:53:04,552 --> 00:53:07,187
And his stuffing was superb.

435
00:53:16,329 --> 00:53:17,364
All right.

436
00:53:26,339 --> 00:53:27,975
Okay. You ready?

437
00:53:29,276 --> 00:53:30,343
Yeah, ready.

438
00:53:36,517 --> 00:53:38,385
Beautiful.

439
00:53:40,054 --> 00:53:41,388
You're right.

440
00:53:50,998 --> 00:53:52,232
Yeah.

441
00:53:54,301 --> 00:53:55,636
Just love them.

442
00:53:57,038 --> 00:53:58,606
Good job, Eric.

443
00:53:59,507 --> 00:54:00,908
Good job, girls.

444
00:54:03,745 --> 00:54:04,846
Hey.

445
00:54:06,881 --> 00:54:08,583
This is your stuff?

446
00:54:09,751 --> 00:54:10,985
Yeah, these are mine.

447
00:54:13,621 --> 00:54:17,225
I didn't know you did this.
How great.

448
00:54:24,331 --> 00:54:25,666
They look so good.

449
00:54:29,436 --> 00:54:33,574
Wow, each one,
so wonderful.

450
00:54:33,608 --> 00:54:34,776
They came out well, huh?

451
00:54:38,378 --> 00:54:41,481
Um, do you
have time tomorrow?

452
00:54:41,516 --> 00:54:43,383
Uh, shouldn't
be a problem.

453
00:54:44,786 --> 00:54:46,721
The earlier the better.

454
00:55:02,703 --> 00:55:04,939
Hello, Jo.
How are you, dear?

455
00:55:04,972 --> 00:55:08,042
Hi, Jean. I'm good.
I think so, anyway.

456
00:55:08,075 --> 00:55:09,777
How are things
at Nationale?

457
00:55:09,811 --> 00:55:13,313
Uh, I think I'm done
here and there.

458
00:55:14,782 --> 00:55:16,117
I think the shows
speak to each other

459
00:55:16,150 --> 00:55:18,085
in a really cool way.

460
00:55:18,119 --> 00:55:23,090
Bravo! The Abigail Firschein
Memorial Show,

461
00:55:23,124 --> 00:55:26,393
it's really such
a big deal and...

462
00:55:26,426 --> 00:55:28,896
Oh, we couldn't be prouder.

463
00:55:28,930 --> 00:55:33,400
The... The first OCAC alum
they've ever featured.

464
00:55:33,433 --> 00:55:35,670
Well, that
must feel good.

465
00:55:35,703 --> 00:55:37,905
I hope the catalogue
comes together in time.

466
00:55:37,939 --> 00:55:39,674
Yes, me too...

467
00:55:39,707 --> 00:55:42,777
Oh, we are thrilled
to be honoring you.

468
00:55:42,810 --> 00:55:45,680
We're...
We're doing a catalogue?

469
00:55:45,713 --> 00:55:47,748
Did you know Jo Tran
is getting a catalogue?

470
00:55:47,782 --> 00:55:49,750
Hey, I can take the bird.

471
00:55:49,784 --> 00:55:51,619
I'm gonna go get something
to eat with Jackie

472
00:55:51,652 --> 00:55:53,154
and then go home.

473
00:55:53,187 --> 00:55:54,822
He can hang
in the car for a bit.

474
00:55:54,856 --> 00:55:56,489
He's fine here.

475
00:55:56,524 --> 00:55:58,391
I'll drop him off
when I come home.

476
00:56:00,561 --> 00:56:03,463
Okay, I'll take him
later then.

477
00:56:06,133 --> 00:56:07,068
-Hey, Jo...
-Hey.

478
00:56:07,101 --> 00:56:08,736
You're coming to
my opening tomorrow, right?

479
00:56:08,769 --> 00:56:10,571
Yeah, definitely.

480
00:56:10,605 --> 00:56:12,707
Uh, Lizzy,
do you have any dental floss?

481
00:57:12,600 --> 00:57:15,136
Hey, Jim, can you let
me into the guest bathroom?

482
00:57:15,169 --> 00:57:17,171
You're not supposed
to be in there.

483
00:57:17,204 --> 00:57:20,775
My hot water is still broken.
I really need a shower.

484
00:57:22,677 --> 00:57:23,744
I'll get the key,

485
00:57:23,778 --> 00:57:25,813
but you're not
supposed to be in there.

486
00:58:44,225 --> 00:58:45,926
I got your door unlocked.

487
00:58:45,960 --> 00:58:48,029
I don't want
any messes in there.

488
00:58:48,062 --> 00:58:49,263
No puddles.

489
00:59:00,207 --> 00:59:01,742
- Hi.
- Hi.

490
00:59:01,776 --> 00:59:02,777
I'm cooking.

491
00:59:03,844 --> 00:59:05,012
Come on in.

492
00:59:09,917 --> 00:59:11,252
Brought you this coat.

493
00:59:12,620 --> 00:59:14,789
It's from dad's.
He thought you'd like it.

494
00:59:18,025 --> 00:59:20,594
And here's an invite
to my show, too, if you want.

495
00:59:21,395 --> 00:59:22,630
I left you a message.

496
00:59:22,663 --> 00:59:23,964
Yeah...

497
00:59:23,998 --> 00:59:26,067
You know
I'm not a big message guy.

498
00:59:27,935 --> 00:59:29,070
What you making?

499
00:59:30,871 --> 00:59:33,207
Dinner of kings. Ragu.

500
00:59:36,177 --> 00:59:39,713
Thought I'd be here earlier,
but so much traffic.

501
00:59:39,747 --> 00:59:41,816
People don't know
how to drive.

502
00:59:41,849 --> 00:59:43,818
Yeah, I almost got hit
the other day.

503
00:59:44,351 --> 00:59:46,087
Not surprised.

504
01:00:26,293 --> 01:00:27,695
What's going on?

505
01:00:28,829 --> 01:00:30,397
I lost Channel 4.

506
01:00:31,132 --> 01:00:33,067
Oh.

507
01:00:33,100 --> 01:00:35,102
It's the only channel
I like to watch.

508
01:00:36,971 --> 01:00:38,806
Has all the old shows on it.

509
01:00:39,740 --> 01:00:41,075
<i>Hawaii 5-0.</i>

510
01:00:42,810 --> 01:00:45,012
<i>Twilight Zone.</i>

511
01:00:45,045 --> 01:00:48,082
The good stuff.
But now it's just gone.

512
01:00:53,220 --> 01:00:54,855
Can you call the company?

513
01:00:56,056 --> 01:00:57,358
I don't have a company.

514
01:00:58,792 --> 01:01:00,227
I use the antenna.

515
01:01:08,469 --> 01:01:10,171
I know what's going on.

516
01:01:12,339 --> 01:01:13,841
What's going on?

517
01:01:14,975 --> 01:01:16,343
You don't want to know.

518
01:01:21,448 --> 01:01:23,984
The neighbors blocked it.

519
01:01:28,322 --> 01:01:30,057
Can they do that?

520
01:01:30,090 --> 01:01:31,926
They figured it out.

521
01:01:31,959 --> 01:01:32,860
I don't... I don't know

522
01:01:32,893 --> 01:01:34,728
if that's something
they can really do.

523
01:01:36,063 --> 01:01:37,331
You don't think so?

524
01:01:39,066 --> 01:01:40,834
Believe me, they can.

525
01:01:40,868 --> 01:01:42,102
And they do.

526
01:01:45,105 --> 01:01:46,508
Those people
have their fingers

527
01:01:46,541 --> 01:01:48,275
all over this place.

528
01:01:54,048 --> 01:01:55,816
Go see for yourself.

529
01:02:15,903 --> 01:02:18,105
Hey, I saw your car
and I thought I'd say "Hi".

530
01:02:18,138 --> 01:02:19,740
Hey, Craig.

531
01:02:21,475 --> 01:02:23,511
-Hi, Sean.
-It's Craig.

532
01:02:23,545 --> 01:02:27,147
Oh, hey. I thought
you were the other neighbors.

533
01:02:30,351 --> 01:02:33,020
Sean was just telling me
about his TV reception,

534
01:02:33,053 --> 01:02:34,522
that he's missing his shows.

535
01:02:34,556 --> 01:02:36,257
Still not working?

536
01:02:36,290 --> 01:02:37,391
Nope.

537
01:02:42,930 --> 01:02:45,099
Thinks the neighbors
have something to do with it.

538
01:02:51,405 --> 01:02:53,173
I see what you're doing.

539
01:02:53,207 --> 01:02:55,476
See what you're trying
to pass along. Ha-ha.

540
01:02:55,510 --> 01:02:57,111
Nice try.

541
01:02:57,144 --> 01:02:59,514
Not passing
anything along, Sean.

542
01:03:01,516 --> 01:03:02,883
If you want, I could get you

543
01:03:02,916 --> 01:03:05,219
a box set
of <i>The Twilight Zone.</i>

544
01:03:05,252 --> 01:03:06,420
Have that on DVD.

545
01:03:09,023 --> 01:03:11,458
That's not the same
if I know what's coming on.

546
01:03:18,432 --> 01:03:20,467
Oh, yeah,
I remember that jacket.

547
01:03:24,338 --> 01:03:25,906
Yeah, same one.

548
01:03:36,083 --> 01:03:39,119
Is he still doing
that landscaping thing?

549
01:03:39,153 --> 01:03:41,355
I thought he had some work.

550
01:03:41,388 --> 01:03:43,490
I don't think so.
Not for a while.

551
01:03:48,295 --> 01:03:49,897
I rescued a bird.

552
01:04:06,046 --> 01:04:07,881
He has a broken wing.

553
01:04:09,551 --> 01:04:10,884
Wow...

554
01:04:13,220 --> 01:04:14,421
Cool.

555
01:04:42,416 --> 01:04:44,351
Oh, he has his struggles.

556
01:04:44,385 --> 01:04:45,486
I am aware.

557
01:04:48,088 --> 01:04:49,624
He could use our love.

558
01:04:52,192 --> 01:04:53,894
He needs
more than that.

559
01:04:57,965 --> 01:05:00,968
He's a genius
is part of the problem.

560
01:05:01,001 --> 01:05:03,170
Always a few steps
ahead of everyone.

561
01:05:05,239 --> 01:05:10,210
Just makes it so hard
to know what to expect.

562
01:05:10,244 --> 01:05:12,146
I don't know
that he's a genius.

563
01:05:12,179 --> 01:05:14,181
Well, he really has something.

564
01:05:14,214 --> 01:05:17,017
A lot of people say that.
They always have.

565
01:05:17,050 --> 01:05:19,119
Some people.

566
01:05:19,153 --> 01:05:23,490
He was always
incredibly creative and, uh,

567
01:05:23,525 --> 01:05:25,593
some of the things
he's done, just...

568
01:05:26,326 --> 01:05:27,327
Wow.

569
01:05:29,029 --> 01:05:31,031
A lot of people are creative.

570
01:05:34,301 --> 01:05:37,605
You should give him
a little more credit.

571
01:05:37,639 --> 01:05:40,374
I do give him credit.
I just think he has problems.

572
01:05:41,375 --> 01:05:42,443
I know...

573
01:05:44,646 --> 01:05:46,113
But really who doesn't?

574
01:05:53,755 --> 01:05:58,058
All right, get out.
Get away. You're running.

575
01:05:59,026 --> 01:06:00,294
Go! You're running fast.

576
01:06:00,327 --> 01:06:03,363
Go, go, go, go,
you're running for your lives.

577
01:06:03,397 --> 01:06:04,632
You're running for your lives.

578
01:06:05,199 --> 01:06:06,333
Go, go!

579
01:06:42,102 --> 01:06:43,403
Bye, thank you.

580
01:06:49,142 --> 01:06:50,545
-Bye, Marlene.
-See ya.

581
01:06:50,578 --> 01:06:51,646
Thank you.

582
01:07:05,660 --> 01:07:07,227
Hey, Lizzy.

583
01:07:07,695 --> 01:07:08,796
Hi.

584
01:07:08,830 --> 01:07:11,566
Come to slum around
in studio arts?

585
01:07:11,599 --> 01:07:14,101
Oh, no.
No, just hiding, really.

586
01:07:14,134 --> 01:07:15,335
Oh, cool.

587
01:07:16,270 --> 01:07:17,805
You can hide in here with me.

588
01:07:21,408 --> 01:07:23,210
So, you share a house?

589
01:07:23,711 --> 01:07:25,580
Oh, no... God.

590
01:07:25,613 --> 01:07:26,814
We're neighbors.

591
01:07:26,848 --> 01:07:29,182
Jo bought an old
apartment building.

592
01:07:30,417 --> 01:07:32,486
Dad and her brother
helped her fix it up.

593
01:07:35,155 --> 01:07:36,658
Well, that sounds great.

594
01:07:36,691 --> 01:07:40,562
Yeah, she really
figured it out.

595
01:07:40,595 --> 01:07:42,830
She can work in the studio
all the time now.

596
01:07:42,864 --> 01:07:45,098
I saw you have a show
coming up.

597
01:07:45,867 --> 01:07:46,701
Monday.

598
01:07:48,536 --> 01:07:50,705
I have a friend in town
from New York.

599
01:07:50,738 --> 01:07:52,507
We'll come check it out.

600
01:07:52,540 --> 01:07:53,541
Cool.

601
01:08:52,734 --> 01:08:53,868
Nah...

602
01:08:55,469 --> 01:08:57,371
Fuck, my phone.

603
01:08:58,405 --> 01:08:59,874
Find it in the morning.

604
01:08:59,907 --> 01:09:01,241
Okay.

605
01:10:45,880 --> 01:10:46,948
Fun night?

606
01:10:51,351 --> 01:10:52,820
It was all right.

607
01:10:53,888 --> 01:10:55,489
A lot of people.

608
01:10:55,523 --> 01:10:56,758
Everyone loved it?

609
01:10:58,492 --> 01:11:00,795
That's what they said.

610
01:11:00,828 --> 01:11:02,029
Sorry I couldn't be there,
but I saw the room.

611
01:11:02,063 --> 01:11:04,331
It looked amazing.

612
01:11:04,364 --> 01:11:07,300
I talked to Marlene Heyman
for a long time last night.

613
01:11:07,334 --> 01:11:08,970
She really likes you.

614
01:11:09,003 --> 01:11:11,304
Went on and on
about your girls, the colors.

615
01:11:11,338 --> 01:11:12,807
Mmm, that's cool.

616
01:11:12,840 --> 01:11:15,610
It is cool.
She's having a moment.

617
01:11:17,377 --> 01:11:19,379
Anyway, I can take the bird
off your hands.

618
01:11:19,412 --> 01:11:20,615
Okay.

619
01:11:20,648 --> 01:11:22,315
Ricky will be happy.

620
01:11:38,032 --> 01:11:39,901
Paper gets gross really fast.

621
01:11:40,535 --> 01:11:41,602
Okay.

622
01:11:56,851 --> 01:11:58,351
Hey, Jo, now that your shows
are open,

623
01:11:58,385 --> 01:12:00,087
you'll get on
the water heater, right?

624
01:12:03,090 --> 01:12:03,925
Yup.

625
01:12:05,793 --> 01:12:07,628
'Cause I'd really like
to take a shower.

626
01:12:13,433 --> 01:12:15,603
Yeah.

627
01:12:15,636 --> 01:12:17,939
All right, this one
turned out beautiful.

628
01:12:17,972 --> 01:12:18,973
Good work. Good work.

629
01:12:40,094 --> 01:12:41,896
Come on, bae.

630
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:47,101
Ahh!

631
01:12:51,038 --> 01:12:53,941
Must've been burning
hot on one side.

632
01:12:53,975 --> 01:12:55,710
It's a little funky, but...

633
01:12:55,743 --> 01:12:57,144
I don't mind imperfections.

634
01:12:57,178 --> 01:12:59,080
In fact, I like them.
I prefer it.

635
01:13:00,581 --> 01:13:02,583
Think it looks cool.

636
01:13:02,617 --> 01:13:04,619
-Don't you?
-Not really.

637
01:13:23,170 --> 01:13:24,505
What?

638
01:13:49,096 --> 01:13:50,665
What's going on?

639
01:13:51,132 --> 01:13:52,133
Oh.

640
01:13:55,002 --> 01:13:56,537
What are you doing here?

641
01:13:59,073 --> 01:14:01,208
Just came by...

642
01:14:01,242 --> 01:14:03,010
I was gonna
show you something.

643
01:14:04,078 --> 01:14:05,713
But you look sort of busy.

644
01:14:10,518 --> 01:14:11,686
What are you doing?

645
01:14:12,820 --> 01:14:14,755
What does it
look like I'm doing?

646
01:14:17,158 --> 01:14:18,726
I'm making a piece.

647
01:14:20,761 --> 01:14:22,163
It's a very major piece.

648
01:14:23,664 --> 01:14:24,865
Very major.

649
01:14:29,904 --> 01:14:32,540
I didn't know
you were into earth work.

650
01:14:35,242 --> 01:14:37,011
Art is the earth talking.

651
01:14:38,312 --> 01:14:40,614
Poetry is the voice
of the earth.

652
01:14:40,648 --> 01:14:42,583
So, it's all earth work.

653
01:14:48,055 --> 01:14:49,590
These are mouths.

654
01:14:58,199 --> 01:14:59,200
Listen.

655
01:15:08,142 --> 01:15:10,544
You have to listen
to what isn't being said.

656
01:15:19,120 --> 01:15:20,287
You hear that?

657
01:15:21,222 --> 01:15:22,857
I don't think I do.

658
01:15:30,331 --> 01:15:33,601
So many people
choose not to hear.

659
01:15:39,206 --> 01:15:40,875
Sean...

660
01:16:06,100 --> 01:16:07,268
Okay...

661
01:16:11,072 --> 01:16:13,841
- Hello.
<i>- I'm at Sean's.</i>

662
01:16:13,874 --> 01:16:15,209
<i>Things are not good here.</i>
<i>He's not good...</i>

663
01:16:15,242 --> 01:16:16,744
<i>He's really off...</i>

664
01:16:51,278 --> 01:16:52,279
Hey.

665
01:16:54,048 --> 01:16:56,150
So, where is he?

666
01:16:56,183 --> 01:16:58,352
Still in the backyard,
I think.

667
01:17:01,255 --> 01:17:02,790
No, you... You go home.

668
01:17:02,823 --> 01:17:05,359
-I can... I can go with you.
-No, please. Lizzy...

669
01:17:07,128 --> 01:17:08,395
You go home.

670
01:17:14,869 --> 01:17:16,270
Whoa... Yeah.

671
01:17:16,303 --> 01:17:17,671
Best thing
I've ever seen.

672
01:17:17,705 --> 01:17:18,873
-I mean it.
-Thank you.

673
01:17:18,906 --> 01:17:20,941
Wow. Technique, um...

674
01:17:22,776 --> 01:17:25,212
I mean, it was
just a momentary thing...

675
01:17:41,061 --> 01:17:42,363
Who is this?
What's this?

676
01:17:42,396 --> 01:17:45,065
Oh, really,
just, like, the worst.

677
01:17:48,035 --> 01:17:49,803
But I think you should look
at her earlier work

678
01:17:49,837 --> 01:17:51,305
because, I think,
that's actually what...

679
01:17:53,407 --> 01:17:55,709
This idea of, like,
post feminism ideal.

680
01:17:55,743 --> 01:17:56,844
Oh, I would.

681
01:17:56,877 --> 01:17:59,313
I think it's actually
a pretty good piece, come on.

682
01:18:11,926 --> 01:18:13,894
- I need to see it.
- Yeah, yeah.

683
01:18:42,122 --> 01:18:44,124
<i>This is Jean. Leave a message.</i>

684
01:18:47,061 --> 01:18:49,830
Mom, what's going on
over there?

685
01:18:49,863 --> 01:18:50,965
Can you fill me in?

686
01:19:08,382 --> 01:19:10,117
<i>Hey, it's Jo. Leave a message.</i>

687
01:19:11,452 --> 01:19:13,555
Hey, one of your guests
took my parking space.

688
01:19:13,588 --> 01:19:15,089
That is not cool.

689
01:19:15,122 --> 01:19:17,992
Also, just reminding you
that the bird

690
01:19:18,025 --> 01:19:20,894
needs his paper changed
every few hours.

691
01:19:23,197 --> 01:19:25,432
Gets pretty gross in there
if you don't change the paper.

692
01:20:35,002 --> 01:20:36,538
<i>This is Jean. Leave a message.</i>

693
01:20:37,739 --> 01:20:40,407
Mom, I'm really anxious
to know what's going on there.

694
01:20:42,443 --> 01:20:43,578
Give me a call.

695
01:21:46,073 --> 01:21:48,142
<i>Hey, it's Jo. Leave a message.</i>

696
01:21:49,410 --> 01:21:52,146
You know, I'm so fucking sick
of not having hot water, Jo.

697
01:21:52,179 --> 01:21:53,548
It is such a total drag.

698
01:21:53,581 --> 01:21:56,283
And such a shitty thing
to do to a person.

699
01:21:56,316 --> 01:21:57,552
I'm sick of it.

700
01:21:58,753 --> 01:22:00,154
Have a great night.

701
01:22:08,328 --> 01:22:10,264
I need to use the shower, too.

702
01:22:10,297 --> 01:22:11,265
Here?

703
01:22:11,298 --> 01:22:14,034
That shower is
a storage space. It's packed.

704
01:22:14,067 --> 01:22:16,170
Well, I don't have any
hot water and I need a shower.

705
01:22:16,203 --> 01:22:17,572
We'll figure it out.

706
01:22:58,746 --> 01:23:00,013
What's going on?

707
01:23:00,047 --> 01:23:01,549
Why haven't
you called me back?

708
01:23:03,651 --> 01:23:06,119
<i>Well,</i>
<i>it's been busy here.</i>

709
01:23:06,153 --> 01:23:07,655
Are you still there?

710
01:23:07,689 --> 01:23:10,558
<i>I just left.</i>
<i>He was finally sleeping.</i>

711
01:23:11,826 --> 01:23:13,595
<i>He had a lot to say.</i>

712
01:23:14,729 --> 01:23:16,196
Are you sure
that he's asleep?

713
01:23:16,230 --> 01:23:17,699
<i>Well, he was quiet.</i>

714
01:23:18,833 --> 01:23:20,167
<i>He was resting.</i>

715
01:23:21,134 --> 01:23:23,571
Okay. Well, call me later.

716
01:23:24,104 --> 01:23:25,105
Bye.

717
01:23:36,718 --> 01:23:38,418
Hey.

718
01:23:38,452 --> 01:23:40,254
Hey.

719
01:23:41,154 --> 01:23:42,256
Where's the bird?

720
01:23:43,625 --> 01:23:44,759
Inside.

721
01:23:45,560 --> 01:23:47,227
You left him alone?

722
01:23:47,261 --> 01:23:48,395
He's fine.

723
01:23:57,572 --> 01:23:59,072
The hot water bottle
doesn't even

724
01:23:59,106 --> 01:24:01,375
- stay hot that long.
- Lizzy...

725
01:24:01,408 --> 01:24:02,777
It isn't even cold out.

726
01:24:06,246 --> 01:24:08,181
When's my hot water
coming back on?

727
01:24:11,519 --> 01:24:12,654
I'm on it.

728
01:24:13,655 --> 01:24:15,757
Well, you keep
saying that, but...

729
01:24:15,790 --> 01:24:17,859
What are we talking, tomorrow?

730
01:24:17,892 --> 01:24:20,260
I have to drive out to Kelso
to get the new heater,

731
01:24:20,294 --> 01:24:21,729
and the guy said
he won't be there tomorrow.

732
01:24:21,763 --> 01:24:23,531
But he's supposed to be there
the next day.

733
01:24:23,565 --> 01:24:25,499
Is that the only
water heater anywhere?

734
01:24:25,533 --> 01:24:27,301
Why does it
have to be that one?

735
01:24:27,334 --> 01:24:29,403
It's the best
and cheapest, yeah.

736
01:24:31,371 --> 01:24:33,106
I pay rent, you know?

737
01:24:33,575 --> 01:24:34,742
Not that much.

738
01:24:35,610 --> 01:24:36,778
What?

739
01:24:39,246 --> 01:24:42,617
I said you don't pay
that much rent, that's all.

740
01:24:42,650 --> 01:24:44,786
You have a really good deal.
It's no excuse for the water.

741
01:24:44,819 --> 01:24:45,853
But you do.

742
01:24:47,387 --> 01:24:50,324
And, please, stop
leaving me messages like that.

743
01:25:41,208 --> 01:25:42,242
All right.

744
01:25:42,275 --> 01:25:43,377
This is a lot
of cheese

745
01:25:43,410 --> 01:25:45,479
and I don't think that people
are gonna eat this much.

746
01:25:47,882 --> 01:25:48,883
They'll eat a little bit of it

747
01:25:48,916 --> 01:25:50,885
and then the rest of it
is gonna go to waste.

748
01:25:51,919 --> 01:25:54,187
Lizzy, your guests
are gonna be here

749
01:25:54,221 --> 01:25:55,957
in a few minutes.

750
01:25:55,990 --> 01:25:57,925
It's going to
be a special night

751
01:25:57,959 --> 01:26:01,729
and no one is going
to be looking at the cheese.

752
01:26:01,763 --> 01:26:03,698
Okay, they're coming
to celebrate you

753
01:26:03,731 --> 01:26:05,399
and all of
your beautiful work.

754
01:26:15,576 --> 01:26:17,512
What's happening?

755
01:26:17,545 --> 01:26:18,813
<i>I just wanted</i>
<i>to let you know</i>

756
01:26:18,846 --> 01:26:20,648
I'm driving over to Sean's.

757
01:26:20,682 --> 01:26:22,282
He said he'd come tonight,

758
01:26:22,315 --> 01:26:25,620
and so I'm bringing him along
as my date.

759
01:26:25,653 --> 01:26:27,855
<i>Okay, if you think</i>
<i>he really wants to.</i>

760
01:26:28,890 --> 01:26:30,490
Oh, he wants to.

761
01:26:30,525 --> 01:26:33,360
<i>Of course he does.</i>
<i>So, we'll see you soon.</i>

762
01:26:33,393 --> 01:26:34,394
Okay. Bye.

763
01:26:42,704 --> 01:26:43,805
Sean's coming.

764
01:26:47,340 --> 01:26:50,410
He's not going
to break anything, is he?

765
01:26:50,444 --> 01:26:52,446
Seems like you're not
taking away any cheese.

766
01:26:58,753 --> 01:26:59,754
Hi, Dad.

767
01:27:02,557 --> 01:27:06,226
It looks amazing!
Oh, boy. Oh, boy!

768
01:27:07,528 --> 01:27:09,797
Hi, Dad.
Um, thank you for coming.

769
01:27:12,600 --> 01:27:14,035
How nice.

770
01:27:14,068 --> 01:27:16,436
It's close to downtown,
that's nice.

771
01:27:16,470 --> 01:27:18,673
This gallery is first rate.

772
01:27:18,706 --> 01:27:19,907
I mean, it might not
look like much,

773
01:27:19,941 --> 01:27:22,543
but they do some
really great things here.

774
01:27:24,545 --> 01:27:25,780
Why don't you guys
have a look?

775
01:27:26,781 --> 01:27:27,915
Or some wine?

776
01:27:27,949 --> 01:27:29,550
Ooh, don't mind if I do.

777
01:27:29,584 --> 01:27:31,052
- Go ahead.
- Yeah.

778
01:27:31,085 --> 01:27:32,319
-Thank you.
-Zinfandel...

779
01:27:32,352 --> 01:27:33,654
Thank you, thank you.

780
01:27:33,688 --> 01:27:34,889
One of those, please.

781
01:27:37,658 --> 01:27:38,659
Dates.

782
01:27:48,936 --> 01:27:51,639
Well, you are very daring
with the colors.

783
01:28:31,512 --> 01:28:32,713
Yeah.

784
01:28:36,918 --> 01:28:38,019
Yeah.

785
01:28:57,138 --> 01:28:58,539
Hello there, Craig.

786
01:28:58,573 --> 01:28:59,406
Hi, Mrs. Carr.

787
01:28:59,439 --> 01:29:02,810
I was hoping
to find Sean back here.

788
01:29:02,844 --> 01:29:03,945
Uh, no one answered the door.

789
01:29:03,978 --> 01:29:05,445
I don't think he's here.

790
01:29:05,478 --> 01:29:09,449
Oh! I'm to pick him up
and I wonder where he is.

791
01:29:11,152 --> 01:29:13,420
Sometimes he...
He walks through the park

792
01:29:13,453 --> 01:29:15,523
over to the corner store
on 92nd.

793
01:29:24,431 --> 01:29:25,733
You know,
it's just a funny thing.

794
01:29:25,766 --> 01:29:28,002
A decade makes
all the difference.

795
01:29:28,035 --> 01:29:29,036
Yeah.

796
01:29:30,037 --> 01:29:31,404
Yes, and who's gonna tell...

797
01:29:31,438 --> 01:29:33,406
How they're gonna
tell their stories?

798
01:29:44,118 --> 01:29:46,587
When I'm in my dream space,

799
01:29:48,222 --> 01:29:50,825
that's when it happens.
I mean, like...

800
01:29:50,858 --> 01:29:54,929
I just flow, you know?
I can do no wrong in that.

801
01:29:54,962 --> 01:29:57,031
At that point,
it just happens.

802
01:30:51,852 --> 01:30:52,853
Hey.

803
01:30:54,055 --> 01:30:56,524
Hey, thanks for coming.

804
01:30:56,557 --> 01:30:57,959
Wouldn't miss it.

805
01:30:57,992 --> 01:30:59,627
Lizzy, this is Janet.

806
01:30:59,660 --> 01:31:02,630
Janet is the gallery director
where I show in New York.

807
01:31:03,731 --> 01:31:04,999
Nice to meet you.

808
01:31:05,032 --> 01:31:08,135
Congratulations.
I hear great things.

809
01:31:08,169 --> 01:31:10,638
Well, my best piece
got closer to the fire

810
01:31:10,671 --> 01:31:11,539
than I wanted,

811
01:31:11,572 --> 01:31:13,741
but I didn't have
any control over that.

812
01:31:13,774 --> 01:31:16,143
Well, things look great
from here.

813
01:31:17,845 --> 01:31:20,281
Come on, at this stage,
you've just got to own it.

814
01:31:20,314 --> 01:31:21,749
How often does
something come out of the kiln

815
01:31:21,782 --> 01:31:23,718
looking just as you expected.

816
01:31:23,751 --> 01:31:24,986
Yeah, I guess...

817
01:31:28,055 --> 01:31:29,090
Jo.

818
01:31:30,691 --> 01:31:32,159
-You came.
-Of course I did.

819
01:31:32,193 --> 01:31:34,195
I brought this guy.
He wanted to say hi.

820
01:31:34,228 --> 01:31:35,229
Oh...

821
01:31:36,097 --> 01:31:38,032
He's seen you make it all.

822
01:31:39,700 --> 01:31:41,501
Yeah, okay.

823
01:31:45,773 --> 01:31:46,874
It looks good.

824
01:31:52,613 --> 01:31:54,115
Your dad's hilarious.

825
01:32:00,121 --> 01:32:01,522
I'm gonna look around.

826
01:32:45,633 --> 01:32:47,601
This one looks familiar.

827
01:32:50,171 --> 01:32:52,773
Yeah, that's me. Cute.

828
01:32:58,779 --> 01:33:00,648
Have you swum
with the dolphins?

829
01:33:01,048 --> 01:33:02,616
Twice.

830
01:33:02,650 --> 01:33:03,717
How much it cost?

831
01:33:05,853 --> 01:33:07,321
-What?
-I don't remember.

832
01:33:13,794 --> 01:33:15,930
I mean, she was just a snob.

833
01:33:15,963 --> 01:33:21,168
Such a snob. Oh, my God.
A first-class snob.

834
01:33:21,202 --> 01:33:23,704
Your dad is talking
about Hilda Morris.

835
01:33:23,737 --> 01:33:25,106
You like her stuff?

836
01:33:25,139 --> 01:33:26,874
Yeah, I love Hilda.

837
01:33:34,882 --> 01:33:36,817
I just, kind of,
fell into that.

838
01:33:42,056 --> 01:33:44,925
My pal did the cabinets
in her living room

839
01:33:44,959 --> 01:33:47,995
and he said she didn't
have a good word for anybody.

840
01:33:48,028 --> 01:33:49,930
For anybody.

841
01:33:49,964 --> 01:33:52,800
Lizzy, it looks wonderful,
just wonderful.

842
01:33:52,833 --> 01:33:54,068
Congratulations.

843
01:33:54,101 --> 01:33:56,070
This is Lizzy's mom,
Jean Carr.

844
01:33:56,103 --> 01:33:57,938
Davis. Jean Davis.

845
01:33:57,972 --> 01:34:00,941
The other thing about her
was this leather vest.

846
01:34:00,975 --> 01:34:02,910
She loved this leather vest.

847
01:34:02,943 --> 01:34:05,412
She would not be seen
without her leather vest.

848
01:34:05,446 --> 01:34:06,947
You talking
about Hilda Morris?

849
01:34:06,981 --> 01:34:09,383
-Yes, I am.
-You never knew Hilda Morris.

850
01:34:09,416 --> 01:34:10,851
I beg to differ.

851
01:34:10,885 --> 01:34:12,052
No, I don't think you did.

852
01:34:12,086 --> 01:34:13,988
-Mom, where's Sean?
-I don't know.

853
01:34:14,021 --> 01:34:15,456
I couldn't find him.

854
01:34:15,489 --> 01:34:16,490
Well, that's his loss.

855
01:34:19,960 --> 01:34:22,096
You know this other friend
of mine has a house...

856
01:34:22,129 --> 01:34:23,697
I thought you
were getting him.

857
01:34:23,731 --> 01:34:24,899
Well, he wasn't there.

858
01:34:24,932 --> 01:34:28,302
And I...
I thought he might be here.

859
01:34:28,335 --> 01:34:29,904
He shouldn't
just be out by himself.

860
01:34:29,937 --> 01:34:30,971
Mom, that's not good.

861
01:34:31,005 --> 01:34:34,375
I'm sure he's fine.
He's probably at a friend's.

862
01:34:34,408 --> 01:34:35,876
Sean doesn't have any friends.

863
01:34:35,910 --> 01:34:38,212
Craig's a friend.

864
01:34:38,245 --> 01:34:40,147
Mom, he could
be anywhere right now.

865
01:34:40,181 --> 01:34:42,283
Lizzy, please relax.

866
01:34:42,316 --> 01:34:45,152
This is your night.
Try to enjoy yourself.

867
01:34:45,186 --> 01:34:46,353
Well, I'm not
just gonna stand here

868
01:34:46,387 --> 01:34:47,855
while Sean has gone missing.

869
01:34:47,888 --> 01:34:49,290
Who said he's gone missing?

870
01:34:51,392 --> 01:34:52,393
Sean...

871
01:34:53,260 --> 01:34:55,162
Oh, there you are.

872
01:34:55,196 --> 01:34:57,765
I... I went to pick you up.

873
01:34:57,798 --> 01:35:00,134
I said I was coming.
I took the bus.

874
01:35:00,167 --> 01:35:02,736
I thought we said
that I was getting you.

875
01:35:03,470 --> 01:35:04,505
No matter.

876
01:35:04,539 --> 01:35:06,040
-Hey.
-I'm happy you're here.

877
01:35:06,073 --> 01:35:07,174
Here I am.

878
01:35:12,980 --> 01:35:15,015
Try picking up your phone
once in a while.

879
01:35:28,095 --> 01:35:29,930
Easy on the cheese.

880
01:35:29,964 --> 01:35:32,132
What do you mean?

881
01:35:32,166 --> 01:35:35,135
It's for everyone.
I don't want to run out.

882
01:35:35,169 --> 01:35:37,304
Cheese is out on the table.

883
01:35:37,338 --> 01:35:39,073
You shouldn't put cheese
out on the table

884
01:35:39,106 --> 01:35:41,041
if you don't
want people to eat it.

885
01:35:41,075 --> 01:35:43,545
-This isn't dinner, Sean.
-It's my dinner.

886
01:35:43,578 --> 01:35:45,813
Leave the cheese alone,
seriously.

887
01:35:45,846 --> 01:35:47,448
Sean, uh,
have you spoken to Craig?

888
01:35:47,481 --> 01:35:49,783
-Uh, he was looking for you.
-What did he want?

889
01:35:50,818 --> 01:35:51,852
Stop it.

890
01:35:52,786 --> 01:35:54,989
Yeah, they came
to the Derick Tibbs show.

891
01:35:55,557 --> 01:35:57,324
Late...

892
01:35:57,358 --> 01:36:00,494
I think they do it on purpose.
Kind of just come.

893
01:36:00,528 --> 01:36:02,029
And then leave.

894
01:36:07,569 --> 01:36:11,372
Hello, Sean! Finally, huh?

895
01:36:11,405 --> 01:36:13,307
Hey, Lizzy, I...
I just wanted to tell you,

896
01:36:13,340 --> 01:36:16,010
I... I really like
your friend Janet.

897
01:36:16,043 --> 01:36:18,445
And, uh, and she said
she wants to come and see, uh,

898
01:36:18,479 --> 01:36:21,081
my pots,
if you know what I'm saying.

899
01:36:21,115 --> 01:36:22,950
Oh, my God,
did you say that to her?

900
01:36:22,983 --> 01:36:24,985
No, I didn't have
to say anything. She offered.

901
01:36:25,019 --> 01:36:26,554
That was to get you to leave.

902
01:36:26,588 --> 01:36:30,157
No, it was not
to get me to leave, Jean.

903
01:36:30,190 --> 01:36:32,026
We had a meeting
of the minds, all right?

904
01:36:32,059 --> 01:36:34,361
We have a lot in common.

905
01:36:34,395 --> 01:36:37,532
Well, we do. We do.
As it turns out, we do.

906
01:36:37,565 --> 01:36:39,233
You're not supposed
to have any cheese.

907
01:36:39,266 --> 01:36:42,336
Who the hell are you?
I can eat as much as I want.

908
01:36:42,369 --> 01:36:45,105
Oh, Lizzy,
the show is awesome.

909
01:36:45,139 --> 01:36:46,440
You should be so proud.

910
01:36:46,473 --> 01:36:47,841
Thanks, Terri.
Thanks for coming.

911
01:36:47,875 --> 01:36:49,143
Yeah, of course.

912
01:36:51,879 --> 01:36:55,149
People sure love
to kiss your ass, huh?

913
01:36:55,983 --> 01:36:57,384
Stop talking to me.

914
01:36:57,418 --> 01:36:59,320
Both of you please stop.
You're embarrassing me.

915
01:36:59,353 --> 01:37:00,387
All right, all right,
all right.

916
01:37:00,421 --> 01:37:01,556
Leave them alone, will you?

917
01:37:01,589 --> 01:37:03,525
You don't have to tell them
how to talk to each other.

918
01:37:03,558 --> 01:37:05,560
What I say to them
doesn't really concern you.

919
01:37:05,593 --> 01:37:07,061
Concerns me
in that I'm here

920
01:37:07,094 --> 01:37:07,961
and I have to listen to it.

921
01:37:07,995 --> 01:37:09,196
No one,
but you in there, Bill.

922
01:37:09,229 --> 01:37:12,166
No, you're standing in
your own little world, Jean.

923
01:37:12,199 --> 01:37:14,134
Listen, buddy, don't you begin

924
01:37:14,168 --> 01:37:16,070
to tell me
how to talk to my kids.

925
01:37:16,103 --> 01:37:17,871
Oh, I wouldn't dare.

926
01:37:17,905 --> 01:37:19,940
Not like
she'd listen anyway.

927
01:37:21,442 --> 01:37:23,210
Bird!

928
01:37:34,922 --> 01:37:36,056
Wow.

929
01:38:23,270 --> 01:38:24,572
No, Sean, wait!

930
01:38:51,533 --> 01:38:53,267
I guess he was ready to go.

931
01:40:19,721 --> 01:40:21,488
Gonna go to get
some cigarettes.

932
01:40:35,770 --> 01:40:37,739
Saw Mike's show yesterday.

933
01:40:37,772 --> 01:40:38,773
How was it?

934
01:40:39,406 --> 01:40:40,407
It was good.

935
01:40:41,308 --> 01:40:43,477
I heard
he's doing deserts again.

936
01:40:44,612 --> 01:40:47,749
Yeah...
I liked his trees better.

937
01:40:49,584 --> 01:40:50,785
I like the deserts.

938
01:40:53,755 --> 01:40:55,590
I always forget
Mike's color blind.

939
01:40:55,623 --> 01:40:56,824
Isn't that weird?

940
01:40:56,858 --> 01:40:58,125
Totally.
