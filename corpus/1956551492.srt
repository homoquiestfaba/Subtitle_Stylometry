um...

Oh, what is it? Adderall?

you're five-six, 197 pounds.

81
00:04:00,762 --> 00:04:03,852

can cause a disruptive sleep pattern.

give you Adderall,

that you're seeing a doctor.

between 45 and 55 pounds.

That's the weight of a Siberian husky.

working dog off of my body. Is that right?

Hey, I know
it's hard to hear.

107
00:05:11,876 --> 00:05:14,444
And look, a lot of people
struggle with their weight

108
00:05:14,618 --> 00:05:17,273
because of thyroid issues
and genetic predispositions,

109

we can help you with that.

[normal voice] Could've at

you don't need to come here in the gym."

Oh, I'm sorry. Um...
I mean, I like your shirt.

You can go ahead with whatever
you're gonna... what the spiel is.

211
00:11:16,023 --> 00:11:20,288
We have a bunch of membership options
to fit all your fitness needs,

as $129 a month.

I'm sorry, I thought you
said, um, "as low,"

214
00:11:26,163 --> 00:11:29,166
and then
$129 for a month.

215
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:30,733
Yeah,
that's a starting rate.

216
00:11:30,907 --> 00:11:33,170
$129 a month,
and for that you get access

we've walked by

can go outside, though,

and, like, do things?

224
00:11:52,581 --> 00:11:53,800
Absolutely.

And that's the same

You know, you pay
for our facilities.

344
00:20:10,992 --> 00:20:12,820
[chuckles]
I don't get it.

345
00:20:12,994 --> 00:20:15,126
No? Just... Oh.

346
00:20:15,301 --> 00:20:16,693
Eh. Bye.

347
00:20:16,867 --> 00:20:19,261
Your sister is always
moving and shaking

348
00:20:19,435 --> 00:20:21,611
and walking around
and doing stuff.

349
00:20:21,785 --> 00:20:24,179
She won't sit down
for nothing.

350
00:20:24,353 --> 00:20:26,877
On Saturday, she's spearheading
a Habitat for Humanity.

351
00:20:27,051 --> 00:20:28,836
What are you doing
this weekend?

352
00:20:29,010 --> 00:20:32,318
[groans]
My legs are so sore.

353
00:20:34,145 --> 00:20:36,800
Would you ever want to go
for a run with me?

354
00:20:36,974 --> 00:20:39,194
I just got in my head.

355
00:20:39,368 --> 00:20:40,761
I want to find a way
to distract myself

356
00:20:40,935 --> 00:20:43,067
so I can get to the point
where I can run a mile.

357
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:47,376
If I do too much cardio,
I get too skinny too quickly. Remember?

358
00:20:47,550 --> 00:20:49,204
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

359
00:20:49,378 --> 00:20:51,162
Yeah, don't do that.

360
00:20:51,337 --> 00:20:53,513
Boink. [chuckles]

361
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:59,910
Okay, welcome, or welcome back,
to Astoria Runners Group.

362
00:21:00,084 --> 00:21:03,000
- Hoody-hoo!
- [group whooping, clapping]

363
00:21:05,786 --> 00:21:08,702
I'm Tesla, the organizer.
We're going a light two miles today.

364
00:21:08,876 --> 00:21:10,007
Oh, my God.

365
00:21:10,181 --> 00:21:11,444
Springing
for nine-minute miles,

366
00:21:11,618 --> 00:21:13,663
so if that's your goal,
keep up with me.

367
00:21:13,837 --> 00:21:15,056
You ready?
Yeah!

368
00:21:15,230 --> 00:21:17,232
On your marks, get set...
[group] Hoody-hoo!

369
00:21:17,406 --> 00:21:20,235
[runners whooping, clapping]

370
00:21:27,547 --> 00:21:30,680
[panting]

371
00:21:34,510 --> 00:21:36,860
[panting]
Fuck.

372
00:21:39,385 --> 00:21:41,604
[exhales]
You can do it.

373
00:21:41,778 --> 00:21:43,214
Yeah, I know.
I'm doing it.

374
00:21:43,389 --> 00:21:46,305
Oh, sorry.
I'm talking to myself.

375
00:21:46,479 --> 00:21:49,960
I can't give up,
or my kid'll judge me.

376
00:21:50,134 --> 00:21:53,921
I hyperventilated after a potato
sack race at his preschool.

377
00:21:54,095 --> 00:21:57,185
He was like,
"Papa, are you my mommy?"

378
00:21:57,359 --> 00:22:00,667
And I was like,
"No, I'm your papa."

379
00:22:00,841 --> 00:22:04,497
And he was like,
"Well, why are you so girly?"

380
00:22:04,671 --> 00:22:07,804
So, I taught him about
gender stereotyping.

381
00:22:07,978 --> 00:22:12,548
I went on my first run,
and in six weeks, I'm running a 5K.

382
00:22:12,722 --> 00:22:14,507
Why are you doing that
to yourself?

383
00:22:14,681 --> 00:22:15,943
You're gonna
lose that thing.

384
00:22:16,117 --> 00:22:17,727
The race?
Yeah.

385
00:22:17,901 --> 00:22:20,643
You don't do it to win it.
You do it to finish it.

386
00:22:22,253 --> 00:22:25,256
You can do it, Seth.
You're a goddamn gazelle.

387
00:22:25,431 --> 00:22:26,867
Adherence
is half the battle.

388
00:22:27,041 --> 00:22:27,911
[Seth groans]

389
00:22:28,085 --> 00:22:30,914
[panting]

390
00:22:31,088 --> 00:22:34,396
Wait.
That was two miles?

391
00:22:34,570 --> 00:22:36,006
I've never done that before
in my life.

392
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:37,660
Hoody-hoo!

393
00:22:39,053 --> 00:22:41,447
Yeah.
What's your name?

394
00:22:42,752 --> 00:22:43,753
I'm Brittany.

395
00:22:43,927 --> 00:22:45,276

00:22:45,451 --> 00:22:48,279

[panting]

403
00:23:09,431 --> 00:23:12,913
- And she had the same dress on as me.
- Sure, sure, sure.

404
00:23:14,741 --> 00:23:16,786
- Britt!
- Gretch!

405
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,266
Britt, let's blaze.

406
00:23:19,876 --> 00:23:22,705
Fucking New York.

407
00:23:25,882 --> 00:23:28,842
What was it
my friend wanted?

408
00:23:29,016 --> 00:23:31,322
Uh...

409
00:23:37,459 --> 00:23:38,765
Oh, that's on backwards.

410
00:23:38,939 --> 00:23:40,767
[laughs]
Come on, it's funny.

411
00:23:40,941 --> 00:23:43,073
Okay, I'll fix it.

412
00:23:57,697 --> 00:24:00,264
- [Brittany chuckling]
- What? Brittany, oh, my God.

413
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:01,788
Oh, hey, we need shots.

414
00:24:01,962 --> 00:24:04,660
My roommate here literally
lost a hundred pounds.

415
00:24:04,834 --> 00:24:06,619
Well, 22.

416
00:24:06,793 --> 00:24:10,536
Still, that's, like,
the same weight as 11 MacBooks.

417
00:24:10,710 --> 00:24:12,799
[British accent] I got a dozen
less laptops in me stomach.

418
00:24:12,973 --> 00:24:14,583
[crowd exclaiming]

419
00:24:14,757 --> 00:24:17,412
[man]
19-20.

420
00:24:20,241 --> 00:24:23,244
I, uh... I found this
health calculator online,

421
00:24:23,418 --> 00:24:26,029
which is kind of cool,
and I have a goal weight now.

422
00:24:26,203 --> 00:24:28,467
Yeah? What is it, like 120?

423
00:24:29,206 --> 00:24:31,252
Uh, 152.

424
00:24:31,426 --> 00:24:34,821
My blood pressure's down,
and I even signed up for my first 5K.

425
00:24:34,995 --> 00:24:36,518
Shut up.
You're gonna run a marathon?

426
00:24:36,692 --> 00:24:40,740
No, a marathon's 26 miles.
5K's only three.

427
00:24:40,914 --> 00:24:43,133
Oh, my gosh, thank you
for the support, Terrence.

428
00:24:43,307 --> 00:24:44,918
[Gretchen]
Well, cool.

429
00:24:45,092 --> 00:24:47,355
Are you gonna try and run faster
than the other people or...

430
00:24:47,529 --> 00:24:49,270
Oh, it's just about
finishing it.

431
00:24:49,444 --> 00:24:52,447
Oh, you should come out after with
me and my running friend, Seth.

432
00:24:52,621 --> 00:24:54,580
[Gretchen] Uh, wait.
[crowd exclaiming]

433
00:24:54,754 --> 00:24:57,234
- Running friend, Seth?
- Yeah.

434
00:24:57,408 --> 00:24:58,671
You never mentioned him
before.

435
00:24:58,845 --> 00:25:01,717
Is he a serious runner,
or is he like you?

436
00:25:02,849 --> 00:25:04,459
He's like me, I guess.

437
00:25:04,633 --> 00:25:08,811
Terrence, babe,
tell Brittany you're excited for her.

438
00:25:08,985 --> 00:25:11,379
[Terrence]
Yeah.

439
00:25:11,553 --> 00:25:12,511
[man]
20-20.

440
00:25:16,253 --> 00:25:19,518
[runners whooping, murmuring]

441
00:25:25,611 --> 00:25:27,917
[runners] And seven, six,

442
00:25:28,091 --> 00:25:30,224
five, four,

443
00:25:30,398 --> 00:25:33,880
three, two, one.

444
00:25:34,054 --> 00:25:36,883
[air horn blares]
[runners cheering]

445
00:25:37,057 --> 00:25:38,972
[both panting]

446
00:25:39,146 --> 00:25:40,843
Oh, my God.

447
00:25:47,458 --> 00:25:50,157
We're going backwards.
[Seth exhales]

448
00:25:51,158 --> 00:25:52,725
Oh, my God.

449
00:25:52,899 --> 00:25:54,596
[runners shouting excitedly]

450
00:25:54,770 --> 00:25:58,774
[man] All right! Good job!
[man 2] Proud of you guys.

451
00:26:00,733 --> 00:26:02,386
[Seth sighs]

452
00:26:02,561 --> 00:26:05,041
How's my baby?
Doing okay?

453
00:26:05,215 --> 00:26:06,695
[man]
I'm so tired.

454
00:26:06,869 --> 00:26:08,654
[child babbles]

455
00:26:08,828 --> 00:26:11,308
[Seth]
I know. I'm a rock star.

456
00:26:11,482 --> 00:26:13,441
Um, so we'll just do
a large cheese pizza.

457
00:26:13,615 --> 00:26:14,877
That should be enough,
yeah?

458
00:26:15,051 --> 00:26:16,531
Oh, do you want to do
the appetizer trio, too?

459
00:26:16,705 --> 00:26:18,838
We'll do the appetizer trio
as well.

460
00:26:19,012 --> 00:26:20,187
Brittany.

461
00:26:20,361 --> 00:26:21,841
You want to go see Daddy
by the flowers?

462
00:26:22,015 --> 00:26:23,407
Go see Daddy by the flowers?
[Brittany chuckles]

463
00:26:23,582 --> 00:26:26,106
- Go! Go, go, go, go, go!
- Oh, my God.

464
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:27,368
Oh, you're in
our runners' group.

465
00:26:27,542 --> 00:26:29,936
Yeah.
Did you run the 5K?

466
00:26:30,110 --> 00:26:32,721
- Hey, that's great.
- You should join us.

467
00:26:32,895 --> 00:26:34,418
Oh, she has kids.
It's a Saturday.

468
00:26:34,593 --> 00:26:36,464
Oh, no, they're at
their dad's this weekend.

469
00:26:36,638 --> 00:26:39,206
Oh, I didn't... I didn't
know you were divorced.

470
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:42,078
Soon. That's why I'm
crashing at the studio.

471
00:26:42,252 --> 00:26:43,819
I'm a photographer,

472
00:26:43,993 --> 00:26:45,691
and I've got the apartment
right above Brittany's.

473
00:26:45,865 --> 00:26:47,257
Oh, smell you.

474
00:26:47,431 --> 00:26:49,477
Wait, so you know this
much-talked-about Gretchen.

475
00:26:49,651 --> 00:26:52,045
I thought she was gonna be
at the finish line.

476
00:26:52,219 --> 00:26:53,742
She had a late night.

477
00:26:53,916 --> 00:26:55,439
Oh, I wanted to meet
your best friend.

478
00:26:55,614 --> 00:26:58,051
[chuckles] It's not
the end of the world.

479
00:26:58,225 --> 00:26:59,356
[tapping keys]

480
00:26:59,530 --> 00:27:01,271
Oof. [sighs]

481
00:27:02,272 --> 00:27:04,666
Jesus Christ, is that me?

482
00:27:08,714 --> 00:27:09,845
- [door opens]
- [Gretchen] Brittany.

483
00:27:10,019 --> 00:27:11,760
Oh, my God,
Terrence is in Boston.

484
00:27:11,934 --> 00:27:13,893
- Let's go out.
- Oh, I-I can't.

485
00:27:14,067 --> 00:27:15,677
I got a runners' group
in the morn.

486
00:27:15,851 --> 00:27:17,244
Come on.

487
00:27:17,418 --> 00:27:22,597
Hey, don't you deserve
a little bit of fun?

488
00:27:22,771 --> 00:27:24,947
[singsongy]
Just a little Addy.

489
00:27:25,121 --> 00:27:27,210
[dance music pulsing]

490
00:27:29,125 --> 00:27:30,692
[retching]

491
00:27:30,866 --> 00:27:32,607
[spits]

492
00:27:35,654 --> 00:27:37,351
[spits]

493
00:27:39,179 --> 00:27:41,268
[groans]

494
00:27:47,883 --> 00:27:49,711
[exhales]

495
00:27:52,801 --> 00:27:54,629
I wanted to go to your thing
this morning,

496
00:27:54,803 --> 00:27:58,415
but there was an Ace of Base
cover band at Vintage last night,

497
00:27:58,589 --> 00:28:00,853
and they didn't go on
until, like, 2:00 a.m.

498
00:28:01,027 --> 00:28:03,116
It's fine.
You don't need to come to those.

499
00:28:03,290 --> 00:28:04,900
"Those"?

500
00:28:05,074 --> 00:28:07,729
You are so cute
with this whole running thing.

501
00:28:07,903 --> 00:28:10,645
- I'm a runner now.
- Me, too.

502
00:28:10,819 --> 00:28:12,908
I mean, we've all got legs.

503
00:28:13,082 --> 00:28:14,823
We're all in a hurry sometimes.

504
00:28:14,997 --> 00:28:18,261
We're all runners when we
need to be, right? [chuckles]

505
00:28:18,435 --> 00:28:20,176
[Seth]
A marathon?

506
00:28:20,350 --> 00:28:22,788
We don't have to win it.
We just have to finish it.

507
00:28:22,962 --> 00:28:24,224
The New York City Marathon?

508
00:28:24,398 --> 00:28:26,095
I think that is
such a good idea.

509
00:28:26,269 --> 00:28:28,054
Catherine,
you're 40 times faster than us.

510
00:28:28,228 --> 00:28:31,057
- Why are you running back here?
- I like talking to you guys.

511
00:28:31,231 --> 00:28:33,842
They're very, very intense at the front.
Not a lot of chitchat.

512
00:28:34,016 --> 00:28:37,193
I don't want you to feel bad for us or
something, and that's why you're back here.

513
00:28:37,367 --> 00:28:40,544
No, I don't. You know, I trained for
the marathon about four years ago.

514
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:42,721
But I had to quit
because I got pregnant.

515
00:28:42,895 --> 00:28:45,419
And my ex-husband's really dragging
me through the mud right now,

516
00:28:45,593 --> 00:28:47,464
so I'd really love
to do this with you guys.

517
00:28:47,638 --> 00:28:49,336
Mm-hmm. You girls have fun.
Come on.

518
00:28:49,510 --> 00:28:51,164
Don't you want to
accomplish something epic?

519
00:28:51,338 --> 00:28:53,993
Or be taken seriously and
change how people look at you?

520
00:28:54,167 --> 00:28:58,171
I don't need to pee myself on
a 26.2-mile race to feel proud.

521
00:28:58,345 --> 00:29:00,608
Literally no one knows
what you're talking about.

522
00:29:00,782 --> 00:29:03,567
People get so tired,
they piss themselves during it.

523
00:29:03,742 --> 00:29:05,221
No, they don't.
[laughing]

524
00:29:05,395 --> 00:29:07,136
Yes. Yes.
That's disgusting.

525
00:29:07,310 --> 00:29:10,487
When my cousin ran it,
she shat her pants,

526
00:29:10,661 --> 00:29:13,142
came back to her apartment
for the party we threw for her,

527
00:29:13,316 --> 00:29:16,102
and had to kick everyone out
so she could clean herself.

528
00:29:16,276 --> 00:29:20,367
I have a child, hopes for another.
It's all I need in life.

529
00:29:20,541 --> 00:29:23,022
Tons of people
don't shit themselves.

530
00:29:23,196 --> 00:29:25,415
You ever think of that?
Okay, listen.

531
00:29:25,589 --> 00:29:26,808
Marathon's next November.

532
00:29:26,982 --> 00:29:28,679
That gives us
less than a year to train.

533
00:29:28,854 --> 00:29:30,420
Brittany and I
will run the marathon.

534
00:29:30,594 --> 00:29:32,074
Seth, you stay home,
you eat ice cream,

535
00:29:32,248 --> 00:29:33,684
and you just look
at pictures on Facebook

536
00:29:33,859 --> 00:29:35,904
of the two of us at the finish line.
How's that?

537
00:29:36,078 --> 00:29:39,342
While your husband and son pick out
mountain bikes after his football practice.

538
00:29:40,343 --> 00:29:41,954
You bitch.
[Catherine, Brittany laugh]

539
00:29:42,650 --> 00:29:45,696
[groaning]
Fine.

540
00:29:45,871 --> 00:29:48,351
We'll never actually do it,
but fine.

541
00:29:48,525 --> 00:29:50,484
- Yes!
- [whoops]

542
00:29:50,658 --> 00:29:52,486
[Catherine] You know,
a lot of people fail at this,

543
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:54,793
but, guys,
I have faith in this group.

544
00:29:54,967 --> 00:29:57,926
[siren wailing] [Seth] Hmm.
That's a bad omen.

545
00:29:58,100 --> 00:30:01,190
Okay, so I'm guaranteed a slot because
I joined a marathon group a while ago,

546
00:30:01,364 --> 00:30:04,585
but for you two to get a slot,
you have to join the lottery.

547
00:30:04,759 --> 00:30:06,935
Oh, I love lotteries.

548
00:30:07,109 --> 00:30:08,067
Yeah, but if you don't win,
then you got to raise money for a charity,

549
00:30:08,241 --> 00:30:10,373
and then they get you
a slot.

550
00:30:10,547 --> 00:30:12,767
And we should probably join a gym
so we can do some cross-training.

551
00:30:12,941 --> 00:30:14,073
Whoa, wait, excuse me.

552
00:30:14,247 --> 00:30:16,118
What?
Uh, ka-ching. [chuckles]

553
00:30:16,292 --> 00:30:18,599
'Cause all that costs a lot of money.
Can we do it on a shoestring?

554
00:30:18,773 --> 00:30:20,427
Well, even the lottery
costs money.

555
00:30:20,601 --> 00:30:23,778
I'm fine with skipping all
this, if it's too much for you.

556
00:30:42,797 --> 00:30:45,191
[subway train squealing]
Hold it!

557
00:30:45,365 --> 00:30:47,410
[panting]

558
00:30:54,461 --> 00:30:56,376
Okay.
Debbie's down for her nap.

559
00:30:56,550 --> 00:30:58,813
Oh, "Debbie Does Napping."

560
00:30:58,987 --> 00:31:00,902
It's a reference.

561
00:31:01,076 --> 00:31:03,209
It's fine. Um...
Oh.

562
00:31:03,383 --> 00:31:05,951
I'm so happy we could sit down and
talk about this nanny position.

563
00:31:06,125 --> 00:31:07,256
Yeah.
I'm psyched.

564
00:31:07,430 --> 00:31:08,867
Uh, so this would be
the room.

565
00:31:09,041 --> 00:31:10,520
Oh, this is the room?
Yeah.

566
00:31:10,694 --> 00:31:13,175
And this would be your bed.

567
00:31:13,349 --> 00:31:16,222
Oh. Look at that surprise.

568
00:31:16,396 --> 00:31:18,920
Your résumé
is really impressive.

569
00:31:19,094 --> 00:31:21,575
Yeah, people rag on Cornell,
but it's still an Ivy, right?

570
00:31:21,749 --> 00:31:23,620
- You majored in education.
- Anyway...

571
00:31:23,794 --> 00:31:25,535
And you babysat
for the Bidens.

572
00:31:25,709 --> 00:31:28,756
Uh, listen, I love kids
and thinking of fun projects,

573
00:31:28,930 --> 00:31:31,411
and I actually kind of flourish
in chaotic atmospheres,

574
00:31:31,585 --> 00:31:33,282
so this is, like...
[clicks tongue]

575
00:31:33,456 --> 00:31:35,850
I just... I have a couple
little questions.

576
00:31:36,024 --> 00:31:37,156
Oh, yeah. Shoot.

577
00:31:37,330 --> 00:31:39,767
I would love you
to walk me through...

578
00:31:39,941 --> 00:31:44,467
uh, the age-appropriate CPR
for this doll.

579
00:31:50,038 --> 00:31:53,085
Okay. Let's do that now.

580
00:31:54,216 --> 00:31:57,089
The first step
is to obviously...

581
00:31:57,263 --> 00:32:00,048
check to see if the child
is breathing.

582
00:32:00,222 --> 00:32:02,921
Mm-hmm.
Yeah. So...

583
00:32:05,662 --> 00:32:06,968
[chuckles awkwardly]

584
00:32:07,142 --> 00:32:09,710
Ooh, I'm sorry,
this child is dead.

585
00:32:11,581 --> 00:32:12,974
[both laughing]
I know it's...

586
00:32:13,148 --> 00:32:14,758
Oh, my God.
It's 'cause the doll.

587
00:32:14,933 --> 00:32:16,673
God, you are hilarious.
[laughs]

588
00:32:16,847 --> 00:32:17,936
[grunting playfully]

589
00:32:18,110 --> 00:32:19,154
Oh, my God.

590
00:32:20,547 --> 00:32:24,551
You have a great personality,
which I love,

591
00:32:24,725 --> 00:32:28,076
but to be honest,
my husband's kind of looking for a nanny

592
00:32:28,250 --> 00:32:30,296
who will fade
into the background.

593
00:32:30,470 --> 00:32:32,776
Thank you so much
for coming, though.

594
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:34,604
Can I get you a bottle
of water for the...

595
00:32:34,778 --> 00:32:37,564
I'm just fading in the background.
Oh, that's so funny. Yeah.

596
00:32:37,738 --> 00:32:40,567
[sighs]
I'm so sorry.

597
00:32:40,741 --> 00:32:42,177
[clears throat]
No, it's fine.

598
00:32:42,351 --> 00:32:44,527
It's just, I keep
interviewing at places,

599
00:32:44,701 --> 00:32:48,227
and no one thinks
I'm the right fit.

600
00:32:48,401 --> 00:32:53,623
Except for dive bars, and I'm sort
of trying to stay out of that scene.

601
00:32:53,797 --> 00:32:57,410
Oh, my goodness.
Who is this gentleman?

602
00:32:57,584 --> 00:32:59,542
Oh, this is a foster.

603
00:32:59,716 --> 00:33:02,502
Ooh, someone's gonna come along
and love you. I just know it.

604
00:33:02,676 --> 00:33:05,635
You know, if you like animals,
I should refer you to my sister.

605
00:33:05,809 --> 00:33:07,072
Is she a dog?

606
00:33:07,246 --> 00:33:09,726
Uh, no, no, she, um...
she owns a company.

607
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:11,990
They do house-sitting
and pet-sitting.

608
00:33:12,164 --> 00:33:16,733
If a homeowner is out of town for a
while and they can't take their pet,

609
00:33:16,907 --> 00:33:20,433
they hire people to be around
for 100 bucks a day.

610
00:33:25,307 --> 00:33:27,135
Oh, my goodness.

611
00:33:27,309 --> 00:33:29,398
You must be Milo.

612
00:33:29,572 --> 00:33:32,880
Oh.
[panting]

613
00:33:38,494 --> 00:33:41,062
[chuckling]
Oh, my goodness.

614
00:33:50,854 --> 00:33:52,943

[man]
What the hell?

634
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:47,781
Bad taste in music.

00:34:47,955 --> 00:34:50,740
You the new girl?
I'm the nighttime guy, Jern.

"Jairm"? Like "Jeremy"?
Hello, Milo.

637
00:34:54,744 --> 00:34:56,703
Mwah.
No, it's Jern.

638
00:34:56,877 --> 00:34:58,792
I didn't know
there was a nighttime guy.

639
00:34:58,966 --> 00:35:01,621
I'm sorry. What are you doing
here in the middle of the day?

640
00:35:01,795 --> 00:35:04,102
Oh. I moved in.

641
00:35:05,973 --> 00:35:08,628
[music playing]

642
00:35:08,802 --> 00:35:10,760
- Hey.
- Yo.

643
00:35:10,934 --> 00:35:13,459
You're living here, yeah?

644
00:35:13,633 --> 00:35:14,982
I sleep here
for the gig anyway,

645
00:35:15,156 --> 00:35:18,072
so now I just chill here
during the day, too.

646
00:35:18,246 --> 00:35:22,729
You just kind of put me in a weird
position, 'cause I have to report this.

647
00:35:22,903 --> 00:35:24,687
Like, contractually,
I have to.

648
00:35:24,861 --> 00:35:27,037
[chuckles]
Oh. Okay.

649
00:35:27,212 --> 00:35:28,778
Yeah.

650
00:35:28,952 --> 00:35:33,043
But wouldn't it be shitty
if they told the owner,

651
00:35:33,218 --> 00:35:36,873
and then he canceled
the service altogether?

652
00:35:37,047 --> 00:35:38,266
That would suck.

653
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:40,399
I mean, I'd get fired,
yeah,

654
00:35:40,573 --> 00:35:43,228
but who knows when another
opening would come around for you?

655
00:35:43,402 --> 00:35:45,447
Is this what you do
full-time, then?

656
00:35:45,621 --> 00:35:47,057
[burps]
Oh, fuck.

657
00:35:47,232 --> 00:35:48,494
How old are you?

658
00:35:48,668 --> 00:35:50,626
Thirty, 35.
Somewhere in there.

659
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:52,193
Doesn't matter.
You know what?

660
00:35:52,367 --> 00:35:54,891
Stop asking me questions,
all right?

661
00:35:55,065 --> 00:35:56,763
My life is dope.

662
00:35:56,937 --> 00:35:59,461
Look at my house.
I live in a fucking mansion.

663
00:36:07,339 --> 00:36:09,036
Where'd you get that?

664
00:36:09,210 --> 00:36:10,516
The mailbox.

665
00:36:10,690 --> 00:36:14,041
I hate him.
Like, I very much hate him.

666
00:36:14,215 --> 00:36:16,261
You're gonna have sex
with him.

667
00:36:16,435 --> 00:36:19,394
- What?
- You're gonna have sex with him.

668
00:36:19,568 --> 00:36:23,006
Trust me, any tension
is sexual tension.

669
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:26,706
Once I figured that out,
I got along way better with my uncle.

670
00:36:29,491 --> 00:36:31,189
Joke.

671
00:36:31,363 --> 00:36:32,886
[chuckles]

672
00:36:35,323 --> 00:36:41,286
When I'm with him, I have this crazy
urge to eat cake, cookies, candy.

673
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:46,421
Just let that sexual tension propel
you while the three of us train.

674
00:36:46,595 --> 00:36:49,468
What if we made it
just the two of us?

675
00:36:51,078 --> 00:36:55,909
Look, I know Catherine's athleticism
and intensity is intimidating,

676
00:36:56,083 --> 00:36:59,608
but she's getting a divorce, and she needs
something to channel her energy into.

677
00:36:59,782 --> 00:37:02,176
[Brittany] I just hate when
people, like, pity me.

678
00:37:02,350 --> 00:37:07,050
Cut her some slack.
She only sees her kids two days a week.

679
00:37:07,225 --> 00:37:08,487
She's got maternal energy
to spare.

680
00:37:08,661 --> 00:37:10,184
[Brittany]
I just don't need a coach.

681
00:37:10,358 --> 00:37:12,752
And I definitely don't need her
to, like, be my mom.

682
00:37:12,926 --> 00:37:14,101
[Seth]
Brittany, come on.

683
00:37:14,275 --> 00:37:16,495
She's trying.

684
00:37:16,669 --> 00:37:18,845
It's hard
to start a new life.

685
00:38:07,546 --> 00:38:09,199
[laughter, lively chatter]

686
00:38:09,374 --> 00:38:10,984
Morning.

687
00:38:13,552 --> 00:38:17,251
[announcer on TV] Flashback Friday
continues right now with moreDoug.

688
00:38:17,425 --> 00:38:18,774
I have a fun question.

689
00:38:18,948 --> 00:38:21,168
Do you ever actually work
at this job?

690
00:38:21,342 --> 00:38:22,778
Do you like Doug?

691
00:38:22,952 --> 00:38:25,868
I've been here for weeks,
and you haven't checked

692
00:38:26,042 --> 00:38:28,218
one thing off
the homeowner's task list.

693
00:38:28,393 --> 00:38:30,090
I got my first boners
'cause of Patti.

694
00:38:30,264 --> 00:38:32,701
Jesus. Yeah, I know.
It gets weirder.

695
00:38:32,875 --> 00:38:34,399
I'd be lying down
with my stepmom,

696
00:38:34,573 --> 00:38:36,139
we'd be all cuddled up
on the couch,

697
00:38:36,314 --> 00:38:38,707
and then Patti Mayonnaise
would come on TV,

698
00:38:38,881 --> 00:38:42,015
and I got busted
'cause that blanket would move.

699
00:38:42,189 --> 00:38:44,191
It'd be like...
[makes whooshing sound]

700
00:38:44,365 --> 00:38:47,063
Oh, it would move 'cause you
got a boner for Patti? [laughs]

701
00:38:47,237 --> 00:38:48,804
Exactly.

702
00:38:48,978 --> 00:38:50,806
Way to brag about your dick size
while watching cartoons.

703
00:38:50,980 --> 00:38:52,852
[turns off TV]
Why... Goddamn it.

704
00:38:53,026 --> 00:38:55,637
You know what?
Cartoons are fun.

705
00:38:55,811 --> 00:38:57,900
And they're colorful
and vibrant,

706
00:38:58,074 --> 00:39:00,686
and they help people actually
get through real-life shit.

707
00:39:00,860 --> 00:39:02,209
Did you know that?

708
00:39:02,383 --> 00:39:03,950
Because when my parents
got divorced, Doug...

709
00:39:04,124 --> 00:39:06,126
Dougis the only thing
that saved me.

710
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:08,563
How long ago was that?
All right, listen.

711
00:39:08,737 --> 00:39:11,653
Divorce sends shock waves
through a young man's life,

712
00:39:11,827 --> 00:39:15,744
a-and I need certain considerations
taken for my particular circumstances.

713
00:39:15,918 --> 00:39:18,138
Oh, I'm so sorry.

714
00:39:18,312 --> 00:39:20,923
I didn't think about the fact that you're
the only person this has ever happened to.

715
00:39:21,097 --> 00:39:22,229
My bad.

716
00:39:22,403 --> 00:39:24,579
Oh, shit. Your dad cheated? No.

717
00:39:24,753 --> 00:39:27,234
- My dad did not cheat.
- Oh, my God. Your mom?

718
00:39:27,408 --> 00:39:29,149
I don't ask you
personal questions,

719
00:39:29,323 --> 00:39:31,847
like why the fuck
your parents named you Jern.

720
00:39:32,021 --> 00:39:33,414
That's racist.

721
00:39:33,588 --> 00:39:35,416
Is Jern an Indian name?

722
00:39:35,590 --> 00:39:36,678
I mean, I don't even know.
Could be.

723
00:39:36,852 --> 00:39:38,724
Fuck you, man.

724
00:39:38,898 --> 00:39:41,683
So your dad doesn't cheat on your
mom, but he definitely leaves her.

725
00:39:41,857 --> 00:39:44,599
And then she...
remarries, right?

726
00:39:44,773 --> 00:39:47,080
Yeah, yeah,
she remarries that dude

727
00:39:47,254 --> 00:39:49,082
that you keep Skyping with all
the time... What's his name?

728
00:39:49,256 --> 00:39:50,649
It's like Desmond
or something, right?

729
00:39:50,823 --> 00:39:53,129
- Demetrius?
- I was close.

730
00:39:53,303 --> 00:39:56,219
He's my sister's husband.
He's basically like my stepdad.

731
00:39:56,394 --> 00:39:58,483
Okay. How does that work?

732
00:39:59,266 --> 00:40:01,181
I...

733
00:40:01,355 --> 00:40:03,009
I don't... [sighs]

734
00:40:03,183 --> 00:40:05,011
Oh, come on.
Don't get...

735
00:40:05,185 --> 00:40:07,535
Okay. Let's make a deal.
All right?

736
00:40:07,709 --> 00:40:09,755
'Cause I need that
juicy, juicy info

737
00:40:09,929 --> 00:40:11,409
that's hidden deep
in your soul,

738
00:40:11,583 --> 00:40:15,717
and you need me to
take out the trash.

739
00:40:15,891 --> 00:40:19,939
Huh? And also clean out,
uh, sections of the fridge.

740
00:40:20,113 --> 00:40:21,201
The whole fridge.

741
00:40:21,375 --> 00:40:24,073
Okay. For you, yes, let's do it.

742
00:40:24,247 --> 00:40:25,640
Okay.

743
00:40:25,814 --> 00:40:29,078
Um, my mom wanted
to be an actress.

744
00:40:29,252 --> 00:40:31,864
She couldn't do that in Philly,
so she left.

745
00:40:32,038 --> 00:40:35,171
My dad got really depressed,
gave up on everything.

746
00:40:35,345 --> 00:40:37,130
A few years later,
he died.

747
00:40:37,304 --> 00:40:39,567
My sister was studying
to become a nurse,

748
00:40:39,741 --> 00:40:44,050
so Demetrius and her...
moved in,

749
00:40:44,224 --> 00:40:46,008
and he basically raised me,

750
00:40:46,182 --> 00:40:51,274
which is awesome
because he himself is awesome.

751
00:40:51,449 --> 00:40:53,276
Yeah,
that sounds awesome.

752
00:40:53,451 --> 00:40:55,801
That sounds like
a Norman Rockwell panting.

753
00:40:55,975 --> 00:40:58,151
I mean,
just totally normal.

754
00:40:58,325 --> 00:41:01,154
- Jern...
- My dad fell in love with another woman.

755
00:41:01,328 --> 00:41:04,244
At least that's how they explained
it to me when I was a kid.

756
00:41:04,418 --> 00:41:06,159
But that's
probably bullshit, right?

757
00:41:06,333 --> 00:41:08,117
I bet she just caught him
banging somebody,

758
00:41:08,291 --> 00:41:10,380
and then
we had to sell our house.

759
00:41:10,555 --> 00:41:13,079
That sucks.

760
00:41:13,253 --> 00:41:15,690
What are you doing?

761
00:41:18,693 --> 00:41:21,435
I'll throw that shit out after
I'm done with this episode.

762
00:41:21,609 --> 00:41:23,698
Jern, grow up.

763
00:41:23,872 --> 00:41:26,135
Oh, my God, girl.
Holy shit.

764
00:41:26,309 --> 00:41:30,139
Drake, third row.
It was, like, so fucking good.

765
00:41:30,313 --> 00:41:32,620
I was, like, almost
making eye contact with him,

766
00:41:32,794 --> 00:41:34,404
and I was like,
"I don't know." He's...

767
00:41:34,579 --> 00:41:37,451
[laughs] I almost barfed
on the train, girl.

768
00:41:37,625 --> 00:41:40,454
[pop music playing]

769
00:42:03,608 --> 00:42:05,914
[subway train screeching]

770
00:42:06,088 --> 00:42:08,047
[bell chiming]
Hold it! Hold it!

771
00:42:10,963 --> 00:42:13,052
[man] Miss?
Oh.

772
00:42:15,445 --> 00:42:17,535
God. Thank you so much.

773
00:42:20,494 --> 00:42:22,278
[bell chimes]

774
00:42:22,452 --> 00:42:24,106
David's picking me up.
Our two-year anniversary. Ah.

775
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:26,195
He's taking me to this
Mexican restaurant in Brooklyn

776
00:42:26,369 --> 00:42:28,763
where they make this guac
with sunflower seeds.

777
00:42:28,937 --> 00:42:32,288
Ooh, that'll either be
really good or terrible.

778
00:42:32,462 --> 00:42:35,161
Hey, babe.
Hey.

779
00:42:35,335 --> 00:42:36,641
I'm David.

780
00:42:36,815 --> 00:42:38,730
Yeah. I'm Brittany.

781
00:42:38,904 --> 00:42:40,862
Been working here six years.
[laughs]

782
00:42:41,036 --> 00:42:42,560
Brittany?

783
00:42:42,734 --> 00:42:44,083
You look great.

784
00:42:44,257 --> 00:42:46,520
You're like
a whole new person.

785
00:42:46,694 --> 00:42:48,609
[British accent] I'm
trainin' for the marathon.

786
00:42:48,783 --> 00:42:52,439
- Many will try.
Few will succeed. -[chuckles]

787
00:42:52,613 --> 00:42:54,833
Okay, babe, let's do this. Yeah.

788
00:42:55,007 --> 00:42:57,009
Who's the, uh,
lucky guy tonight?

789
00:42:57,183 --> 00:43:00,447
Well, you're not going home
alone looking like that, are you?

790
00:43:00,621 --> 00:43:02,667
[Shannon]
David.

791
00:43:07,802 --> 00:43:09,761
[typing]

792
00:43:19,074 --> 00:43:21,294
Yo, girl.

793
00:43:25,254 --> 00:43:26,952
Hey.

794
00:43:27,126 --> 00:43:29,911
It's Tuesday. Why aren't you
snoozing at Terrence's?

795
00:43:32,087 --> 00:43:34,916
Um, we broke up.

796
00:43:35,090 --> 00:43:36,439
When?

797
00:43:36,614 --> 00:43:38,790
Last week.
I posted about it.

798
00:43:38,964 --> 00:43:41,967
I haven't been on.

799
00:43:42,141 --> 00:43:44,447
Why didn't you tell me?
Are you okay?

800
00:43:44,622 --> 00:43:46,493
Yeah, I'm fine.
It's just...

801
00:43:46,667 --> 00:43:50,149
You know, I just watched, like,
I don't even know, 22 YouTube videos

802
00:43:50,323 --> 00:43:52,151
by this girl
who's, like, 4'11",

803
00:43:52,325 --> 00:43:54,283
and she has
a full-blown lazy eye,

804
00:43:54,457 --> 00:43:56,155
and she has sponsorship deals.

805
00:43:56,329 --> 00:43:57,809
I mean, like...

806
00:43:57,983 --> 00:44:00,812
I'm just confused and annoyed.

807
00:44:00,986 --> 00:44:03,771
What a slut.
We hate her.

808
00:44:03,945 --> 00:44:06,426
Is being annoyed
stupid of me?

809
00:44:07,253 --> 00:44:08,428
[chuckles quietly]

810
00:44:10,082 --> 00:44:11,605
Hey, want to get a drink?

811
00:44:11,779 --> 00:44:14,521
What do you want?
Tequila? Beer? [chuckles]

812
00:44:14,695 --> 00:44:16,305
Whatever you want.

813
00:44:16,479 --> 00:44:18,612
I mean, I-I can't drink.

814
00:44:18,786 --> 00:44:20,309
Okay, what about ice cream?

815
00:44:20,483 --> 00:44:25,140
This is your night,
so you... you pick what you want.

816
00:44:25,314 --> 00:44:29,971
Okay, but I want to know
what sounds good to you.

817
00:44:33,932 --> 00:44:36,761
[scoffs] Okay. Well...

818
00:44:44,072 --> 00:44:45,813
I'm sorry.

819
00:44:45,987 --> 00:44:48,773
I'm just... busy now.

820
00:44:48,947 --> 00:44:50,688
I'm working two jobs.

821
00:44:50,862 --> 00:44:53,516
I'm exhausted.

822
00:44:53,691 --> 00:44:55,997
I've lost 34 pounds.

823
00:44:57,042 --> 00:44:59,131
Okay.

824
00:45:01,873 --> 00:45:04,789
It's a big deal.

825
00:45:04,963 --> 00:45:07,182
I'm just trying
to get my life in order.

826
00:45:07,356 --> 00:45:09,532
Are you saying that
my life is not in order?

827
00:45:09,707 --> 00:45:10,969
No.

828
00:45:11,143 --> 00:45:12,448
Because I'm
a teacher's assistant

829
00:45:12,622 --> 00:45:14,537
for deaf, gifted kids
on the Lower East Side.

830
00:45:14,712 --> 00:45:16,539
You're incredible.
I just...

831
00:45:17,497 --> 00:45:18,759
I just mean, like...

832
00:45:19,934 --> 00:45:23,764
the weeknight drinking
is hard for me.

833
00:45:23,938 --> 00:45:27,028
- You're calling me an alcoholic now?
- No.

834
00:45:27,202 --> 00:45:29,335
Because you're the only one
with the problem around here.

835
00:45:29,509 --> 00:45:32,468
- Problems, plural.
- Oh, that's mean.

836
00:45:32,642 --> 00:45:35,297
You're fucking mean,
Brittany.

837
00:45:35,471 --> 00:45:37,343
Don't come in here
and judge me.

838
00:45:37,517 --> 00:45:40,694
I have never judged you, and trust
me, there was a lot to judge.

839
00:45:40,868 --> 00:45:43,741
Wow. We're on the same page that
right now you are judging me, right?

840
00:45:43,915 --> 00:45:47,527
You know what, just go take a
run with your loser friends.

841
00:45:47,701 --> 00:45:51,661
- [amplified heartbeat thumping]
- [panting quietly]

842
00:45:56,623 --> 00:45:58,756
You're a loser.

843
00:45:58,930 --> 00:46:01,715
I make fun of people like you who spend
all day humble-bragging on Instagram.

844
00:46:01,889 --> 00:46:03,717
Okay, I'm not humble-bragging.
That's my life.

845
00:46:03,891 --> 00:46:06,328
I'm sorry no one
likes your life.

846
00:46:06,502 --> 00:46:08,417
Those people don't know you.

847
00:46:08,591 --> 00:46:10,593
I know you.

848
00:46:10,768 --> 00:46:12,726
And you may be
naturally pretty,

01:03:35,246 --> 01:03:38,075
athletic,
marathon-training runners.

1192
01:03:38,249 --> 01:03:39,816
Bye.

1193
01:03:41,948 --> 01:03:43,602
What was that about?

1194
01:03:49,347 --> 01:03:50,696
[cell phone vibrates]

1195
01:03:50,870 --> 01:03:52,306
Hey.

1196
01:03:52,480 --> 01:03:55,614
I got a spot... the lottery.

1197
01:03:55,788 --> 01:03:57,790
Oh, my God,
I'm running to my computer.

1198
01:04:08,496 --> 01:04:10,629
Seth, I'm so happy for you.

1199
01:04:10,803 --> 01:04:11,978
Oh, no.

1200
01:04:12,152 --> 01:04:13,980
Yeah, I didn't get one.

1201
01:04:14,154 --> 01:04:15,721
But it's okay.

1202
01:04:15,895 --> 01:04:18,376
I just have to raise money
for a charity now.

1203
01:04:18,550 --> 01:04:20,291
Totally doable.
[chuckles]

1204
01:04:20,465 --> 01:04:24,382
I mean, I can't save money for
myself, but I'll figure it out.

1205
01:04:24,556 --> 01:04:26,079
Shit.

1206
01:04:26,253 --> 01:04:28,212
Let's talk about it at
Catherine's housewarming party.

1207
01:04:28,386 --> 01:04:30,301
She found a great place
with room for her kids.

1208
01:04:30,475 --> 01:04:33,565
We're gonna go and support her,
and I'm gonna help you.

1209
01:04:35,262 --> 01:04:37,090
Wh-Why would you want
to do that?

1210
01:04:37,264 --> 01:04:39,876
[chuckling] Because I'm your
friend, Brittany.

1211
01:04:42,095 --> 01:04:44,271
[man] Did you see Rodrigo's
fire installation?

1212
01:04:44,445 --> 01:04:47,579
[Catherine] Uh, Tina saw
it, and she liked it.

1213
01:04:47,753 --> 01:04:49,798
Really?
Yeah. Believe so.

1214
01:04:49,973 --> 01:04:52,236
What'd you think?
[sighs]

1215
01:04:52,410 --> 01:04:54,934
I found
the whole showing cold.

1216
01:04:55,108 --> 01:04:56,457
Very cold.

1217
01:04:56,631 --> 01:04:58,285
And in no way subversive;
very literal.

1218
01:04:58,459 --> 01:05:00,244
Oh, you guys are talking
about The Walking Dead?

1219
01:05:00,418 --> 01:05:01,506
Very literal.

1220
01:05:01,680 --> 01:05:03,595
This is...
This is Brittany.

1221
01:05:03,769 --> 01:05:05,814
I have the studio
above her apartment.

1222
01:05:05,989 --> 01:05:08,121
And we're training
for the marathon together.

1223
01:05:08,295 --> 01:05:10,123
[Brittany chuckles]

1224
01:05:10,297 --> 01:05:12,821
Uh... okay.

1225
01:05:12,996 --> 01:05:14,388
[both chuckle awkwardly]

1226
01:05:14,562 --> 01:05:16,869
I'm gonna get another job.
[Seth] What?

1227
01:05:17,043 --> 01:05:19,654
You're stretched thinner
than a Listerine strip.

1228
01:05:19,828 --> 01:05:21,482
[laughter]
Just tell her.

1229
01:05:21,656 --> 01:05:23,789
Okay.
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

1230
01:05:24,790 --> 01:05:28,402
So, my family
has this trust,

1231
01:05:28,576 --> 01:05:31,362
and every year,
I get to make a donation

1232
01:05:31,536 --> 01:05:33,886
to an organization
that I pick.

1233
01:05:34,060 --> 01:05:36,933
So, Seth wanted to pitch in,

1234
01:05:37,107 --> 01:05:41,111
because we wouldn't even be running
this marathon if it wasn't for you.

1235
01:05:50,076 --> 01:05:52,774
You really inspired us,
Britt.

1236
01:05:54,211 --> 01:05:56,648
You're gonna do it.

1237
01:05:56,822 --> 01:05:59,129
You're gonna
run the marathon.

1238
01:06:00,478 --> 01:06:02,219
[scoffs quietly]

1239
01:06:07,180 --> 01:06:10,749
This money should be going
to something you care about.

1240
01:06:12,011 --> 01:06:13,143
It is.

1241
01:06:14,753 --> 01:06:16,537
[laughing]
Okay.

1242
01:06:16,711 --> 01:06:19,671
I don't need you to, like,
force your way into my life

1243
01:06:19,845 --> 01:06:22,282
and give me pep talks
and checks.

1244
01:06:22,456 --> 01:06:23,892
I don't need your pity.

1245
01:06:24,067 --> 01:06:25,546
[Seth]
We're just trying to help.

1246
01:06:25,720 --> 01:06:27,635
[Brittany]
I don't need that.

1247
01:06:27,809 --> 01:06:29,855
I can do this on my own.

1248
01:06:32,336 --> 01:06:34,207
Do you know what time it is?

1249
01:06:34,381 --> 01:06:37,254
I forgot, I...
I have to go to something.

1250
01:06:37,428 --> 01:06:39,908
[Seth] I thought we were
gonna get dinner with Jern.

1251
01:06:40,083 --> 01:06:42,389
I told Peter we were gonna
meet your boyfriend.

1252
01:06:42,563 --> 01:06:44,261
He's not
my fucking boyfriend.

1253
01:06:44,435 --> 01:06:46,263
Don't know why
you keep saying that.

1254
01:06:46,437 --> 01:06:49,614
Your place is great.
I'll see you tomorrow.

1255
01:06:51,094 --> 01:06:53,009
[chattering]
[mariachi music playing]

1256
01:06:53,183 --> 01:06:55,359
I'm starving.
Finally. I'm famished.

1257
01:06:55,533 --> 01:06:57,883
Where are your friends?

1258
01:06:58,057 --> 01:07:00,277
Uh, something happened
with their kid.

1259
01:07:00,451 --> 01:07:02,018
Parents.

1260
01:07:02,192 --> 01:07:03,236
[groans]
Yeah.

1261
01:07:03,410 --> 01:07:04,716
All right, well,
I'm always happy

1262
01:07:04,890 --> 01:07:06,805
when it's just
the two of us anyway.

1263
01:07:08,546 --> 01:07:10,765
We're just having sex,
right?

1264
01:07:10,939 --> 01:07:12,767
I mean, we're not dating.

1265
01:07:12,941 --> 01:07:16,206
Uh-uh, no, uh... We don't
have to define anything.

1266
01:07:16,380 --> 01:07:17,381
Right.

1267
01:07:17,555 --> 01:07:19,122
Okay, so we're not.

1268
01:07:19,296 --> 01:07:20,732
I could never date you.

1269
01:07:20,906 --> 01:07:23,126
[laughs]
[Brittany chuckles]

1270
01:07:23,300 --> 01:07:25,563
Okay, then.

1271
01:07:25,737 --> 01:07:27,652
Thank you.
What do you want to eat?

1272
01:07:27,826 --> 01:07:29,436
Chips and salsa
are just fine, so...

1273
01:07:29,610 --> 01:07:32,874
- I thought you were starving.
- Well, maybe I'm just thirsty.

[groans]

1288
01:09:32,907 --> 01:09:36,476
You've made such
incredible progress.

1289
01:09:36,650 --> 01:09:38,652
You're giving me sympathy?
It's that bad?

1290
01:09:38,826 --> 01:09:40,480
You have a stress fracture.

1291
01:09:40,654 --> 01:09:43,266
Okay.
Uh, from overuse.

1292
01:09:43,440 --> 01:09:46,617
Next time, you got to pay
attention to your pain. Sure. Fine.

1293
01:09:46,791 --> 01:09:49,010
What do I have to do to make
sure I can run the marathon?

1294
01:09:49,185 --> 01:09:51,448
It's in five weeks.
I'm sorry.

1295
01:09:51,622 --> 01:09:53,841
You're gonna have to stay off
your foot for eight weeks.

1296
01:09:54,015 --> 01:09:55,669
Maybe more, depending.

1297
01:09:55,843 --> 01:09:58,542
But the good news is that your
blood pressure, your BMI...

1298
01:09:58,716 --> 01:10:00,152
I'm sorry, what do...
what do you mean?

1299
01:10:00,326 --> 01:10:02,110
Then how do I
run the marathon?

1300
01:10:02,285 --> 01:10:04,200
How am I supposed
to run the marathon?

1301
01:10:04,374 --> 01:10:08,160
Well, in six weeks, you'll come
back, and we'll see what's next.

1302
01:10:09,683 --> 01:10:11,424
You may have suffered
permanent damage.

1303
01:10:12,643 --> 01:10:13,818
[Seth]
Brittany, ugh.

1304
01:10:13,992 --> 01:10:16,516
How can I help? How can you help me?

1305
01:10:16,690 --> 01:10:19,215
How can you help
a former-turned-future fat girl

1306
01:10:19,389 --> 01:10:21,304
with a bum leg
and chafed armpits?

1307
01:10:21,478 --> 01:10:22,827
Hey, everything's
gonna be fine.

1308
01:10:23,001 --> 01:10:25,612
I was trying
to turn my life around.

1309
01:10:25,786 --> 01:10:29,442
And now you'll be the man
who proved himself to his son

1310
01:10:29,616 --> 01:10:31,966
by running
the New York City Marathon,

1311
01:10:32,140 --> 01:10:36,623
and Catherine will be the woman who got out of
a bad marriage and ran a freaking marathon,

1312
01:10:36,797 --> 01:10:40,932
and I'm gonna be a girl who was stupid enough
to think she could turn her life around

1313
01:10:41,106 --> 01:10:43,326
and instead needed
a fucking seat belt extender

1314
01:10:43,500 --> 01:10:45,023
and couldn't even walk dogs for a living.

1315
01:10:45,197 --> 01:10:47,504
Don't... Don't say that.
Stop.

1316
01:10:47,678 --> 01:10:49,636
Oh, I got to go.

1317
01:10:49,810 --> 01:10:52,204
[groaning]
Hey.

1318
01:10:52,378 --> 01:10:54,598
[sniffles]
You got to come with me.

1319
01:10:54,772 --> 01:10:56,208
I want to show you
something, okay?

1320
01:10:56,382 --> 01:10:59,864
Come with me real quick.
I just want you to see the...

1321
01:11:00,038 --> 01:11:01,605
What happened to your leg?

1322
01:11:01,779 --> 01:11:04,912
What, you wouldn't fuck
a girl with an Aircast?

1323
01:11:05,086 --> 01:11:06,697
[chuckles] Wh-What?

1324
01:11:06,871 --> 01:11:08,481
How about a girl who weighs
50 pounds more than me, Jern?

1325
01:11:08,655 --> 01:11:12,006
Because guess what... the pounds
are coming back from vacation.

1326
01:11:12,180 --> 01:11:13,530
Did you hurt yourself?

1327
01:11:13,704 --> 01:11:16,533
Yes, Jern,
I hurt myself.

1328
01:11:19,710 --> 01:11:23,279
[voice breaking] It was really
nice to be a woman for once.

1329

1330
01:11:31,330 --> 01:11:33,289
I'll hold doors for you.

1331

You're not a man, Jern.
You're a misguided little boy.

so you can stay in her room,

- No big deal.

my life is what it is.

was for nothing?

to and parent/teacher conferences?

at 10:00 p.m.

right?

Who withdrew my college application
to make sure you were okay,

1504
01:20:10,849 --> 01:20:12,808
because I wanted to help
make up for your mom.

1505
01:20:12,982 --> 01:20:15,985
And after all that, you still just
want to get through life alone.

1506
01:20:16,159 --> 01:20:17,508
How am I supposed to
fix that?

1507

You got to let people in,

01:20:20,032 --> 01:20:22,687
You think I don't see you hitting
"ignore" when people call you?

1509

I'm embarrassed.

1510
01:20:24,732 --> 01:20:25,821
So, because you're embarrassed,
you're just gonna be an island?

1511
01:20:25,995 --> 01:20:28,127
That's your solution?

1512
01:20:28,301 --> 01:20:30,913
When your mom left your dad,
he was humiliated.

1513
01:20:31,087 --> 01:20:32,479
He was a puddle.

1514
01:20:32,653 --> 01:20:34,307
But you stroked his hair,

1515
01:20:34,481 --> 01:20:36,266
and you put paper towels
on your head

1516
01:20:36,440 --> 01:20:38,790
and danced around him
and made him laugh.

1517
01:20:38,964 --> 01:20:43,229
And every day, you'd wake up and do something
just like that 'cause you knew he needed you.

1518
01:20:43,403 --> 01:20:46,798
Your dad found happiness
because of that.

1519
01:20:46,972 --> 01:20:52,064
And I'm not gonna lie to you... if he would've
rejected that, he would've been a damn fool.

1520
01:20:52,238 --> 01:20:54,545
I used to do that?

1521
01:20:54,719 --> 01:20:57,678
Put paper towels
on my head and dance?

1522
01:20:57,853 --> 01:20:59,463
You still do that.

1523
01:20:59,637 --> 01:21:01,160
I'm serious. You did it on
Skype, like, three months ago.

1524
01:21:01,334 --> 01:21:03,249
The kids are still
talking about it.

1525
01:21:03,423 --> 01:21:06,165
You changing your life
and wanting to run this marathon

1526
01:21:06,339 --> 01:21:09,386
was never about your weight.

1527
01:21:10,866 --> 01:21:13,433
It was about you taking
responsibility for yourself.

1528
01:21:14,782 --> 01:21:15,914
I know.

1529
01:21:16,088 --> 01:21:17,742
You got to stop being mean.

1530
01:21:17,916 --> 01:21:21,224
Some people actually want
good things for you.

1531
01:21:21,398 --> 01:21:24,096
If someone wants
to support you...

1532
01:21:26,098 --> 01:21:27,926
I should let them.

1533
01:21:45,248 --> 01:21:47,032
[knocking]

1534
01:21:48,294 --> 01:21:49,730
Here you go.

1535
01:22:00,916 --> 01:22:02,700
[chimes]

1536
01:22:09,054 --> 01:22:11,883
[Jasmine]
I want to thank you for...

1537
01:22:12,057 --> 01:22:15,365
the lovely flowers
and the note.

1538
01:22:15,539 --> 01:22:18,194
But I want you
to know something.

1539
01:22:18,368 --> 01:22:20,022
I know your pain.

1540
01:22:21,588 --> 01:22:23,939
'Cause it was my pain, too.

1541
01:22:25,810 --> 01:22:29,727
I think about my body
every day.

1542
01:22:29,901 --> 01:22:32,338
I have my whole life.

1543
01:22:32,512 --> 01:22:35,863
But I decided
that even with my pain,

1544
01:22:36,038 --> 01:22:39,171
my fear, my self-judgment,

1545
01:22:39,345 --> 01:22:42,827
other people's judgments,
I wanted to be happy.

1546
01:22:43,001 --> 01:22:44,960
And I am.

1547
01:22:45,134 --> 01:22:47,788
Best wishes. Jasmine.

1548
01:23:03,065 --> 01:23:04,588
How are you guys?

1549
01:23:04,762 --> 01:23:06,633
Let's start there.
I feel like I never ask you that.

1550
01:23:06,807 --> 01:23:08,244
How are you doing?

1551
01:23:09,680 --> 01:23:11,247
[Seth]
Yeah.

1552
01:23:11,421 --> 01:23:13,901
There's a lot
to catch up on.

1553
01:23:14,076 --> 01:23:15,729
Yeah.

1554
01:23:15,903 --> 01:23:18,863
I mean, you guys did it.
So proud of you.

1555
01:23:19,037 --> 01:23:21,213
Saw the pictures and...

1556
01:23:21,387 --> 01:23:22,736
We reached out.

1557
01:23:22,910 --> 01:23:24,695
I know.

1558
01:23:24,869 --> 01:23:26,871
I'm sorry.

1559
01:23:27,045 --> 01:23:31,658
I'm just, um,
really fucked-up in life.

1560
01:23:31,832 --> 01:23:33,965
So is everyone.

1561
01:23:38,274 --> 01:23:40,276
We missed you,
Brittany.

1562
01:23:51,809 --> 01:23:53,898
[knocking at door]

1563
01:24:00,383 --> 01:24:02,124
Why does it say
you relapsed?

1564
01:24:02,298 --> 01:24:04,517
I didn't.

1565
01:24:04,691 --> 01:24:06,693
But it-it says that you did.

1566
01:24:06,867 --> 01:24:10,871
Mm.
I was... doing a shoot.

1567
01:24:11,046 --> 01:24:13,265
I fell. I broke my wrist.

1568
01:24:13,439 --> 01:24:15,659
This was months before
we started running.

1569
01:24:15,833 --> 01:24:17,965
And then the doctor
prescribed me oxycodone.

1570
01:24:18,140 --> 01:24:19,706
I took it.
I didn't tell my husband,

1571
01:24:19,880 --> 01:24:21,665
because he gets weird
about these things.

1572
01:24:21,839 --> 01:24:23,101
He found the bottle.

1573
01:24:23,275 --> 01:24:24,842
And he kept that
misleading trump card

1574
01:24:25,016 --> 01:24:27,845
in his back pocket
until last month.

1575
01:24:28,019 --> 01:24:30,978
You don't even have
visitation rights? No.

1576
01:24:32,458 --> 01:24:34,243
I'm just... I'm trying
really, really hard

1577
01:24:34,417 --> 01:24:36,941
to just focus on the things
that I can control,

1578
01:24:37,115 --> 01:24:38,769
so I started running a lot.

1579
01:24:38,943 --> 01:24:40,858
I stand up for myself in
mediation, but Marco's a fighter.

1580
01:24:41,032 --> 01:24:43,034
I... This divorce is,
like, killing me.

1581
01:24:43,208 --> 01:24:46,124
I mean, he pushed me out of the
house, and he's gonna keep pushing.

1582
01:24:46,298 --> 01:24:48,387
I haven't slept
in three weeks.

1583
01:24:49,823 --> 01:24:52,478
I just don't think
I can fight him anymore.

1584
01:24:52,652 --> 01:24:55,002
Your kids will never forgive
you if you give up on them.

1585
01:24:55,177 --> 01:24:56,091
I know.

1586
01:24:56,265 --> 01:24:57,483
This could take years.

1587
01:24:58,615 --> 01:25:00,225
Start with this one hearing,

1588
01:25:00,399 --> 01:25:03,489
and then you just take it
step by step.

1589
01:25:04,490 --> 01:25:06,013
Little goals.

1590
01:25:08,233 --> 01:25:09,626
Thank you.

1591
01:25:11,454 --> 01:25:13,978
Goddamn!
It's upsetting how good this is.

1592
01:25:14,152 --> 01:25:16,154
Like, it's so good.

1593
01:25:16,328 --> 01:25:20,463
I ate a dry salad for lunch to feel
okay about this. Mm. Delicious.

1594
01:25:20,637 --> 01:25:23,030
Yeah, it was, like, very dry.

1595
01:25:23,205 --> 01:25:25,207
Like, I looked like
a brontosaurus eating it.

1596
01:25:25,381 --> 01:25:27,600
You looked like a little brontosaurus?
Mm-hmm. I was like...

1597
01:25:27,774 --> 01:25:29,733
- [munches loudly]
- [making chewing noises]

1598
01:25:29,907 --> 01:25:31,256
[laughs]

1599
01:25:31,430 --> 01:25:34,868
- Care to see a dessert menu?
- Uh, uh, fuck yes.

1600
01:25:35,042 --> 01:25:36,261
Yes, please.
Thank you.

1601
01:25:36,435 --> 01:25:38,307
So, I owe you an apology.
No, you don't.

1602
01:25:38,481 --> 01:25:40,918
Mm-mm. No apologies.
We're all good.

1603
01:25:41,092 --> 01:25:44,617
I just think we should celebrate
a fancy advertising lady.

1604
01:25:44,791 --> 01:25:48,752
It's just a coordinator position...
basically a glorified intern.

1605
01:25:48,926 --> 01:25:51,058
But...
the office is in Tribeca.

1606
01:25:51,233 --> 01:25:52,712
Ooh.
There's room for growth.

1607
01:25:52,886 --> 01:25:55,976
And I, uh... I'll be able
to get my own place.

1608
01:25:56,151 --> 01:25:58,588
You're really doing it.
[laughing] Yeah.

1609
01:25:58,762 --> 01:26:01,765
Oh, my God, your Kickstarter
bird poncho video.

1610
01:26:01,939 --> 01:26:03,593
Oh, God, no. Why?

1611
01:26:03,767 --> 01:26:06,770
[stammers] No, I thought the
idea behind it was hilarious.

1612
01:26:06,944 --> 01:26:09,164
I sent it to
my college professor,

1613
01:26:09,338 --> 01:26:10,687
and he basically said
he doesn't think

1614
01:26:10,861 --> 01:26:12,341
somebody like me
could even get into

1615
01:26:12,515 --> 01:26:14,212
the individualized study
school at NYU,

1616
01:26:14,386 --> 01:26:17,084
which is shocking because I
literally graduated from there.

1617
01:26:17,259 --> 01:26:21,437
Yeah. Well, that's...
You know, someone still...

1618
01:26:21,611 --> 01:26:23,482
Stop. Stop.
I'll stop talking.

1619
01:26:23,656 --> 01:26:26,137
Tonight
is about celebrating.

1620
01:26:30,924 --> 01:26:34,014
This is the part where I get
nervous 'cause I have to be honest.

1621
01:26:34,189 --> 01:26:36,147
Um...

1622
01:26:36,321 --> 01:26:39,411
I don't think
we should have sex anymore.

1623
01:26:39,585 --> 01:26:41,718
It's not the best thing
for me right now.

1624
01:26:41,892 --> 01:26:43,676
Okay. Yeah, I get that.

1625
01:26:44,547 --> 01:26:46,505
What if it was
more than sex?

1626
01:26:46,679 --> 01:26:49,116
Because we have, um...

1627
01:26:49,291 --> 01:26:51,423
I mean,
I think that if...

1628
01:26:51,597 --> 01:26:53,730
You... You're not making
eye contact with me.

1629
01:26:53,904 --> 01:26:55,079
I'm sorry.
Wow.

1630
01:26:55,253 --> 01:26:56,994
I try to
get my shit together,

1631
01:26:57,168 --> 01:26:59,866
and it's just one rejection
after another.

1632
01:27:00,040 --> 01:27:01,520
I get it.
Do you?

1633
01:27:01,694 --> 01:27:04,131
Yes. I very much get it.

1634
01:27:04,306 --> 01:27:05,829
I'm so sorry.

1635
01:27:06,003 --> 01:27:08,875
My whole life has changed
so much this past year,

1636
01:27:09,049 --> 01:27:12,575
and I'm just trying to take
responsibility for myself,

1637
01:27:12,749 --> 01:27:17,275
and I'm not at a place where I can
be responsible for someone else, too.

1638
01:27:17,449 --> 01:27:19,973
You don't need to be
responsible for me.

1639
01:27:20,147 --> 01:27:21,758
But I would want to be.

1640
01:27:21,932 --> 01:27:23,194
[laughs]
I-I would.

1641
01:27:23,368 --> 01:27:25,457
[chuckles]
Okay. That's so nice.

1642
01:27:25,631 --> 01:27:28,155
We need to figure our shit
out, you know?

1643
01:27:29,548 --> 01:27:31,246
Can we be friends?

1644
01:27:32,334 --> 01:27:34,031
Gross.
I know.

1645
01:27:34,205 --> 01:27:36,207
Does it... Do you get sick
when you say it?

1646
01:27:36,381 --> 01:27:38,818
Yeah, I feel nauseous.
'Cause it hurts my ears.

1647
01:27:38,992 --> 01:27:41,125
- Could we be friends, though?
- Yuck.

1648
01:27:41,299 --> 01:27:43,475
Is there a world...
Yeah, sure.

1649
01:27:43,649 --> 01:27:45,347
In which we could be friends?
Yes.

1650
01:27:45,521 --> 01:27:48,350
Should've just told the Uber to
come right to the restaurant.

1651
01:27:48,524 --> 01:27:50,090
[laughing]
No, it's fine. It's fine.

1652
01:27:50,265 --> 01:27:52,484
I actually went to the
doctor this morning, and, uh,

1653
01:27:52,658 --> 01:27:54,356
he says I'll be able
to start training soon.

1654
01:27:54,530 --> 01:27:56,749
Are you crazy?
You still want to?

1655
01:27:56,923 --> 01:27:58,664
Yeah, I still want to.

1656
01:27:58,838 --> 01:28:01,885
I want to run the goddamn
New York City Marathon.

1657
01:28:02,059 --> 01:28:05,018
My whole life,
the world told me I was lazy

1658
01:28:05,192 --> 01:28:06,455
because of
the way I looked.

1659
01:28:06,629 --> 01:28:08,544
And I told myself
the same thing.

1660
01:28:08,718 --> 01:28:10,110
Fuck that.

1661
01:28:10,285 --> 01:28:13,853
I said I was gonna run
that race, and I'm going to.

1662
01:28:14,027 --> 01:28:15,594
Okay.

1663
01:28:15,768 --> 01:28:17,553
So, what now?

1664
01:28:17,727 --> 01:28:19,642
You're just gonna go home
and hang with Gretchen?

1665
01:28:19,816 --> 01:28:21,296
Oh, she moved in
with Terrence.

1666
01:28:21,470 --> 01:28:22,688
Oh.

1667
01:28:22,862 --> 01:28:24,864
You have the place
to yourself.

1668
01:28:25,038 --> 01:28:26,692
I could come over.

1669
01:28:26,866 --> 01:28:29,042
But you're not...
you're not going to.

1670
01:28:29,216 --> 01:28:30,696
I'm homeless.

1671
01:28:30,870 --> 01:28:32,219
Homeless?
Yes.

1672
01:28:32,394 --> 01:28:34,570
You have whatever couch
you've been sleeping on.

1673
01:28:34,744 --> 01:28:36,528
Oh.

1674
01:28:36,702 --> 01:28:38,748
That's me.

1675
01:28:42,055 --> 01:28:43,448
Bye, friend.

1676
01:28:43,622 --> 01:28:45,494
[both laugh]

1677
01:28:47,104 --> 01:28:48,148
[Jern]
Hey.

1678
01:28:48,323 --> 01:28:49,976
Call me tomorrow?

1679
01:29:29,189 --> 01:29:30,974
Go on.

1680
01:29:31,148 --> 01:29:33,280
[woman]
Hold it, please!

1681
01:29:36,675 --> 01:29:38,808
[chuckling]
Thank you.

1682
01:29:40,200 --> 01:29:42,812
[quiet chatter]

1683
01:29:58,436 --> 01:30:02,135
- [cheering]
- [chattering]

1684
01:30:11,057 --> 01:30:13,886
[heartbeat thumping]

1685
01:30:30,294 --> 01:30:32,165
[exhales]

1686
01:30:48,617 --> 01:30:49,835
[man]
Runners!

1687
01:30:50,706 --> 01:30:52,534
On your mark!

1688
01:30:56,929 --> 01:30:58,322
One block.

1689
01:31:08,463 --> 01:31:11,553
[starting gun fires]
[cheering, applause]

1690
01:31:17,602 --> 01:31:19,909
[man on PA]
Good morning, runners.

1691
01:31:20,083 --> 01:31:21,693
Welcome.

1692
01:31:21,867 --> 01:31:23,826
You are 50,000 strong,

1693
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:27,743
from over 125 nations,

1694
01:31:27,917 --> 01:31:30,485
all 50 states,

1695
01:31:30,659 --> 01:31:34,227
all here at the crossroads
of the world.

1696
01:31:35,664 --> 01:31:39,189
Today, you are taking part
in something very special,

1697
01:31:39,363 --> 01:31:42,148
a day that
brings together people
