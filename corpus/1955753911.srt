[speaking Vietnamese]

375
00:31:36,890 --> 00:31:38,592
Move, bitch!

376
00:31:56,609 --> 00:31:58,609
[coughing]

377
00:31:58,611 --> 00:32:01,680
The girl we have may be
the one with the tattoo.

378
00:32:01,682 --> 00:32:03,615
Let's see her flesh
when she comes up.

379
00:32:03,617 --> 00:32:05,450
Yes sir.

380
00:32:05,452 --> 00:32:07,655
You know anything about that,
traitor?

381
00:32:09,656 --> 00:32:10,588
Huh?

382
00:32:10,590 --> 00:32:12,292
You hear that?

383
00:32:22,836 --> 00:32:25,640
[gasping and crying]

384
00:32:32,946 --> 00:32:36,714
Before me today, are traitors
to their own kind.

385
00:32:36,716 --> 00:32:38,517
And you will be punished.

386
00:32:38,519 --> 00:32:39,617
[whispering] You gotta
be kidding me.

387
00:32:39,619 --> 00:32:42,320
They said a young girl
has a tattoo.

388
00:32:42,322 --> 00:32:45,656
Tell him, my dear, do you
have a tattoo?

389
00:32:45,658 --> 00:32:47,092
Have you killed my brothers?

390
00:32:47,094 --> 00:32:48,359
[pleading in Vietnamese]

391
00:32:48,361 --> 00:32:50,228
And you, Private Harwick...

392
00:32:50,230 --> 00:32:52,596
I charge you
with finding us out here.

393
00:32:52,598 --> 00:32:54,098
And your incompetent
lieutenant

394
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:55,701
for killing one of my men.

395
00:32:55,703 --> 00:32:57,571
Have you anything to say?

396
00:32:59,373 --> 00:33:00,708
Enough of this!

397
00:33:03,944 --> 00:33:05,477
[girl screams]

398
00:33:05,479 --> 00:33:07,112
Back off now!

399
00:33:07,114 --> 00:33:08,480
Lower your weapons!

400
00:33:08,482 --> 00:33:09,647
Drop the gun!

401
00:33:09,649 --> 00:33:11,048
Lower your weapons!

402
00:33:11,050 --> 00:33:12,249
You won't get far
by killing me.

403
00:33:12,251 --> 00:33:14,152
Drop the gun now.
Drop it!

404
00:33:14,154 --> 00:33:15,953
Drop the gun!

405
00:33:15,955 --> 00:33:16,991
Back off!

406
00:33:17,825 --> 00:33:20,057
This American here,
he's with me.

407
00:33:20,059 --> 00:33:21,993
Drop your gun!

408
00:33:21,995 --> 00:33:24,462
- Back off!
- Lower your weapons!

409
00:33:24,464 --> 00:33:26,030
Back off!

410
00:33:26,032 --> 00:33:28,666
What the fuck you guys
doin' out here?

411
00:33:28,668 --> 00:33:29,667
Huh?

412
00:33:29,669 --> 00:33:31,838
Cuttin' off fingers is pretty
fucked up!

413
00:33:33,173 --> 00:33:35,673
Me and Private here won't say
anything, alright?

414
00:33:35,675 --> 00:33:37,009
Right Private?

415
00:33:37,011 --> 00:33:38,175
Let's go, get back!

416
00:33:38,177 --> 00:33:39,411
I will die.

417
00:33:39,413 --> 00:33:40,578
I'm takin' the girl!

418
00:33:40,580 --> 00:33:42,580
If she's guilty, they'll hang
her anyways.

419
00:33:42,582 --> 00:33:44,915
Back off now.
Lower your weapons.

420
00:33:44,917 --> 00:33:46,317
- Back off.
- Lower 'em!

421
00:33:46,319 --> 00:33:48,019
- Back off.
- Lower your weapons!

422
00:33:48,021 --> 00:33:49,621
- Tell 'em now!
- Do as he says.

423
00:33:49,623 --> 00:33:51,292
- Back it up!
- Do as he says.

424
00:33:52,259 --> 00:33:53,090
What?

425
00:33:53,092 --> 00:33:54,625
- What are we doin'?
- I don't know!

426
00:33:54,627 --> 00:33:56,661
[woman speaking Vietnamese]

427
00:33:56,663 --> 00:33:57,729
I'll cut your fingers off,
I swear.

428
00:33:57,731 --> 00:33:59,698
Shut the fuck up. Take that
thing off her head.

429
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:01,599
Go! Go.

430
00:34:01,601 --> 00:34:03,468
Hurry up, Harwick!

431
00:34:03,470 --> 00:34:04,502
Get in there!

432
00:34:04,504 --> 00:34:06,270
Don't you dare move.
Don't even move.

433
00:34:06,272 --> 00:34:07,642
Stay there!

434
00:34:08,142 --> 00:34:09,577
Don't you move!

435
00:34:11,678 --> 00:34:13,013
Don't you fuckin' move.

436
00:34:20,754 --> 00:34:22,453
Sit down, sit down!

437
00:34:22,455 --> 00:34:23,654
C'mon, give me your finger.

438
00:34:23,656 --> 00:34:24,689
My God.

439
00:34:24,691 --> 00:34:26,290
- Give it to me. Hold still.
- Alright. Alright.

440
00:34:26,292 --> 00:34:28,225
Tie it tight, tie it tight.

441
00:34:28,227 --> 00:34:30,694
Oh my God,
where's the lieutenant?

442
00:34:30,696 --> 00:34:32,830
He's fuckin' dead. He got cut
up to shit, up top, man.

443
00:34:32,832 --> 00:34:34,001
Jesus Christ.

444
00:34:34,868 --> 00:34:36,700
Oh my God, okay,
it's gonna be fine.

445
00:34:36,702 --> 00:34:37,836
Hey, what's your name?

446
00:34:37,838 --> 00:34:39,437
- Aw, fuck that, oh for...
- Stop it!

447
00:34:39,439 --> 00:34:41,439
Harwick, we don't have time
for this!

448
00:34:41,441 --> 00:34:42,240
What's your name?

449
00:34:42,242 --> 00:34:44,109
Ly... Kim-Ly.

450
00:34:44,111 --> 00:34:46,544
- Show me the tattoo!
- Stop it!

451
00:34:46,546 --> 00:34:48,113
Where's the radio?

452
00:34:48,115 --> 00:34:50,714
How would she know
where the radio is!?

453
00:34:50,716 --> 00:34:51,415
Wire...

454
00:34:51,417 --> 00:34:53,017
The wire leads to the radio?

455
00:34:53,019 --> 00:34:55,187
Let's go, let's get out
of here! Move!

456
00:34:55,189 --> 00:34:56,190
Go!

457
00:34:58,124 --> 00:34:59,857
You two, hunt them down!

458
00:34:59,859 --> 00:35:01,058
Yes, sir.

459
00:35:01,060 --> 00:35:03,662
- The bodies, sir.
- Get rid of these traitors!

460
00:35:03,664 --> 00:35:04,995
And the fingers?

461
00:35:04,997 --> 00:35:06,533
I'll take care of that later.

462
00:35:07,434 --> 00:35:09,037
Get them!

463
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:15,573
Hunt them down.

464
00:35:15,575 --> 00:35:16,841
No mercy.

465
00:35:16,843 --> 00:35:18,546
Yes, sir.

466
00:35:26,319 --> 00:35:27,655
Sir?

467
00:35:32,059 --> 00:35:35,062
[indiscernible] all of you.

468
00:35:38,664 --> 00:35:40,634
There will be no mercy here...

469
00:35:42,435 --> 00:35:44,539
Not in my bunker.

470
00:36:00,086 --> 00:36:02,656
I will condemn them all.

471
00:36:04,124 --> 00:36:05,892
All of them.

472
00:36:07,493 --> 00:36:09,995
Here we go, here we go.

473
00:36:09,997 --> 00:36:12,596
Which way?
This way or that way?

474
00:36:12,598 --> 00:36:13,732
That way?

475
00:36:13,734 --> 00:36:16,203
- Let's go, come on!
- Move, move.

476
00:36:18,037 --> 00:36:19,604
Damn, it's hot.

477
00:36:19,606 --> 00:36:21,540
Captain Cook, sir.

478
00:36:21,542 --> 00:36:23,140
The paperwork
you requested.

479
00:36:23,142 --> 00:36:24,008
Thank you, Private.

480
00:36:24,010 --> 00:36:25,745
Dismissed.

481
00:36:26,446 --> 00:36:28,013
Get this mess cleaned up.

482
00:36:28,015 --> 00:36:30,051
I gotta hit the head.

483
00:36:32,084 --> 00:36:33,250
Soldier!

484
00:36:33,252 --> 00:36:35,689
Grab some gear and let's go!

485
00:36:40,026 --> 00:36:41,493
Move your ass.

486
00:36:41,495 --> 00:36:42,997
Come on, get in.

487
00:36:45,499 --> 00:36:46,798
Move it.

488
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,535
Let's go.

489
00:36:50,136 --> 00:36:51,203
Shit.

490
00:36:51,205 --> 00:36:52,604
How's your finger?

491
00:36:52,606 --> 00:36:54,538
- Huh?
- How does it look?

492
00:36:54,540 --> 00:36:56,341
What the fuck are they doin'
up there?

493
00:36:56,343 --> 00:36:57,875
Fuckin' Ranger psycho

494
00:36:57,877 --> 00:36:59,477
choppin' off fingers
with a cigar cutter.

495
00:36:59,479 --> 00:37:01,680
What the fuck is wrong
with those Special Forces?

496
00:37:01,682 --> 00:37:04,915
- A whole ten of 'em.
- They're all fucked up.

497
00:37:04,917 --> 00:37:06,850
Kim, is that ra-
is that wire...

498
00:37:06,852 --> 00:37:08,086
That'll take us to the radio?

499
00:37:08,088 --> 00:37:09,620
Forget about her,
let's drop her.

500
00:37:09,622 --> 00:37:11,089
She's dead weight
and I don't trust her.

501
00:37:11,091 --> 00:37:14,024
I don't have time for this,
man, she's helping us out.

502
00:37:14,026 --> 00:37:16,261
If it wasn't for her,
we'd be fuckin' dead by now.

503
00:37:16,263 --> 00:37:19,064
There's Special Forces
all over the place.

504
00:37:19,066 --> 00:37:21,933
Kim, the wire. Does it lead
to the radio?

505
00:37:21,935 --> 00:37:23,801
Is there where we go?
Just follow the wire?

506
00:37:23,803 --> 00:37:26,004
Wire take us
to the generator?

507
00:37:26,006 --> 00:37:27,439
Kim, the wire.

508
00:37:27,441 --> 00:37:29,174
How does she know
where the radio is?

509
00:37:29,176 --> 00:37:30,408
I dunno, maybe she's been
here before.

510
00:37:30,410 --> 00:37:32,042
And how has she been here
before?

511
00:37:32,044 --> 00:37:34,011
So what if she's been here
before, Harwick!

512
00:37:34,013 --> 00:37:36,046
Does it take us to the radio?

513
00:37:36,048 --> 00:37:36,848
Kim?

514
00:37:36,850 --> 00:37:38,049
Yes?

515
00:37:38,051 --> 00:37:40,051
I wanna see that tattoo,
whether she's got it or not.

516
00:37:40,053 --> 00:37:42,087
What the fuck is the tattoo?
What does that matter?

517
00:37:42,089 --> 00:37:44,055
- He was talking' about it.
- What are you talkin' about?

518
00:37:44,057 --> 00:37:46,024
Ranger said that she had
a tattoo.

519
00:37:46,026 --> 00:37:47,158
A tattoo of what?

520
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:49,660
I dunno, she's supposed to
have a tattoo on her back.

521
00:37:49,662 --> 00:37:51,095
The traitor has a tattoo.

522
00:37:51,097 --> 00:37:52,497
No Harwick,
she's not no traitor.

523
00:37:52,499 --> 00:37:53,698
She's helping' us out.

524
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:55,232
That's great, but I wanna see
that tattoo on her back...

525
00:37:55,234 --> 00:37:56,401
Hey, stop it!

526
00:37:56,403 --> 00:37:58,203
- Show me!
- Stop it.

527
00:37:58,205 --> 00:38:00,537
God damnit, man!

528
00:38:00,539 --> 00:38:03,076
[coughing]
Shh... Did you hear that?

529
00:38:04,111 --> 00:38:05,877
[fly buzzing]

530
00:38:05,879 --> 00:38:07,281
- Did you hear that?
- Yeah.

531
00:38:08,414 --> 00:38:10,417
I'm gonna go check it out.

532
00:38:11,184 --> 00:38:12,716
You stay here and watch her.

533
00:38:12,718 --> 00:38:13,817
Don't leave me here
with her.

534
00:38:13,819 --> 00:38:15,020
Harwick, I have to,

535
00:38:15,022 --> 00:38:17,122
or else they're gonna get
the drop on us, okay?

536
00:38:17,124 --> 00:38:18,355
- I'll be back.
- Fuck.

537
00:38:18,357 --> 00:38:21,125
Stay here and untie her,
she's not no fuckin' slave.

538
00:38:21,127 --> 00:38:22,830
Move, get back here quick.

539
00:38:24,097 --> 00:38:28,600
Listen, bitch, make one wrong
move, I'll fuckin' blast you.

540
00:38:28,602 --> 00:38:31,136
Tiberius, you're creation'
paperwork for me...

541
00:38:31,138 --> 00:38:33,037
and I hate paperwork.

542
00:38:33,039 --> 00:38:35,208
You boys better be here.

543
00:38:40,981 --> 00:38:42,049
Ouf!

544
00:39:15,082 --> 00:39:16,046
Sir.

545
00:39:16,048 --> 00:39:18,084
The wire you requested.

546
00:39:25,158 --> 00:39:27,328
I told you, no mercy!

547
00:39:31,698 --> 00:39:33,598
Dodge.

548
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:36,937
I already informed you, I
have everything under control.

549
00:39:40,307 --> 00:39:41,475
Guard!

550
00:39:42,609 --> 00:39:45,046
I have more work to do
in the interrogation room.

551
00:39:47,847 --> 00:39:49,516
Remain at your post.

552
00:39:50,617 --> 00:39:51,885
No commie filth...

553
00:39:53,086 --> 00:39:57,325
...or useless soldier will
leave my bunker alive today.

554
00:40:01,495 --> 00:40:03,798
All will be condemned.

555
00:40:09,102 --> 00:40:12,106
[water dripping]

556
00:40:21,180 --> 00:40:23,050
[crying in the distance]

557
00:41:09,129 --> 00:41:11,298
[distant crying]

558
00:41:24,743 --> 00:41:27,347
Hey, I'm not going to hurt you.

559
00:41:28,647 --> 00:41:29,881
Just relax.

560
00:41:29,883 --> 00:41:33,084
Gimme the ropes. I just wanna
untie you, man.

561
00:41:33,086 --> 00:41:36,120
Just get... just take it easy.

562
00:41:36,122 --> 00:41:38,022
[shouting]

563
00:41:38,024 --> 00:41:39,326
Oh God!
[moans]

564
00:41:40,660 --> 00:41:41,995
[gunshot]

565
00:41:45,966 --> 00:41:47,698
Oh fuck.

566
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:50,937
No... I wasn't here
to hurt you.

567
00:42:13,426 --> 00:42:14,895
Gimme your hands.
[grunts]

568
00:42:17,930 --> 00:42:19,796
Fuck, they tied these tight.

569
00:42:19,798 --> 00:42:21,401
Get this off.

570
00:42:22,502 --> 00:42:23,433
Listen...

571
00:42:23,435 --> 00:42:24,801
I know you're
a fucking traitor

572
00:42:24,803 --> 00:42:26,504
and I wanna see
that goddamned tattoo.

573
00:42:26,506 --> 00:42:28,573
If you move I'll blast your
fucking head off.

574
00:42:28,575 --> 00:42:29,643
Now show me.
[whimpering]

575
00:42:31,577 --> 00:42:33,544
[grunting]

576
00:42:33,546 --> 00:42:36,281
Lay down.
Show me that tattoo.

577
00:42:36,283 --> 00:42:38,448
[screams]

578
00:42:38,450 --> 00:42:41,451
[grunting]

579
00:42:41,453 --> 00:42:42,522
Aah!

580
00:42:45,624 --> 00:42:47,091
[yells]

581
00:42:47,093 --> 00:42:49,259
[gurgling]

582
00:42:49,261 --> 00:42:50,397
Oh my god!

583
00:42:58,437 --> 00:42:59,437
Shit!

584
00:42:59,439 --> 00:43:00,837
Give me that!

585
00:43:00,839 --> 00:43:04,544
[growls]

586
00:43:05,544 --> 00:43:07,414
Go. Go!

587
00:43:09,316 --> 00:43:10,415
Move.

588
00:43:10,417 --> 00:43:11,318
What happened here?

589
00:43:13,319 --> 00:43:15,886
Fatass stabbed me. Fuck.

590
00:43:15,888 --> 00:43:16,921
You alright?

591
00:43:16,923 --> 00:43:19,457
I'll fuckin' make it.
Where's that child?

592
00:43:19,459 --> 00:43:21,091
Don't worry about it.

593
00:43:21,093 --> 00:43:22,859
You gonna make it through?

594
00:43:22,861 --> 00:43:24,294
We're gonna get through this.

595
00:43:24,296 --> 00:43:25,499
Let's just do it.

596
00:43:26,499 --> 00:43:30,167
Alright, let's go, come on.
Lead the way.

597
00:43:30,169 --> 00:43:31,703
Let's go, Kim.

598
00:43:31,705 --> 00:43:34,008
[grunts]
Follow him.

599
00:43:36,776 --> 00:43:38,412
[gasps]

600
00:43:39,379 --> 00:43:41,348
[flies buzzing]

601
00:43:51,423 --> 00:43:53,693
[snake hissing]

602
00:44:02,234 --> 00:44:04,504
My fallen brothers...

603
00:44:06,906 --> 00:44:10,411
You have all fought and died
with courage and honor.

604
00:44:14,446 --> 00:44:16,517
Because of your bravery...

605
00:44:18,484 --> 00:44:21,055
...you all share
in eternal glory.

606
00:44:23,289 --> 00:44:25,626
I am not long for this world.

607
00:44:26,926 --> 00:44:29,930
My body grows weaker
by the hour.

608
00:44:31,731 --> 00:44:34,834
But there is one more battle
I must endure.

609
00:44:40,406 --> 00:44:42,943
One of our own
has deserted us.

610
00:44:44,611 --> 00:44:46,446
My heart is heavy...

611
00:44:47,479 --> 00:44:49,816
but I know what I must do.

612
00:44:51,917 --> 00:44:53,921
He leaves me no choice.

613
00:44:58,258 --> 00:44:59,727
It's time.

614
00:45:16,341 --> 00:45:19,345
[choking coughs]

615
00:45:32,091 --> 00:45:34,994
[coughing and spitting]

616
00:46:52,638 --> 00:46:54,772
Raven, my brethren,

617
00:46:54,774 --> 00:46:56,944
it's time we discussed
your end.

618
00:46:58,678 --> 00:47:00,881
[choking coughs]

619
00:47:02,749 --> 00:47:06,716
I see you've finally left us
for a drop of water.

620
00:47:06,718 --> 00:47:08,588
I offered you blood.

621
00:47:14,260 --> 00:47:17,828
There was a time when
you were one of my elite.

622
00:47:17,830 --> 00:47:19,566
One of the best.

623
00:47:20,533 --> 00:47:21,966
Not anymore.

624
00:47:21,968 --> 00:47:23,337
Not now.

625
00:47:24,136 --> 00:47:26,037
You're weak.

626
00:47:26,039 --> 00:47:28,171
You're not one of us.

627
00:47:28,173 --> 00:47:29,841
You've gone to the other side.

628
00:47:29,843 --> 00:47:30,674
[grunts]

629
00:47:30,676 --> 00:47:32,843
- Their side!
- I'm not on their side.

630
00:47:32,845 --> 00:47:35,648
I just couldn't follow
your last few commands.

631
00:47:37,783 --> 00:47:40,052
My commands, yes.

632
00:47:41,120 --> 00:47:43,053
You haven't got the heart
or the soul

633
00:47:43,055 --> 00:47:45,758
to follow my orders anymore.

634
00:47:53,399 --> 00:47:55,933
I know you speak English,
you piece of shit.

635
00:47:55,935 --> 00:47:58,038
I've heard you
through the walls.

636
00:47:59,037 --> 00:48:01,805
You understand me,
don't you?

637
00:48:01,807 --> 00:48:02,842
Yes.

638
00:48:07,379 --> 00:48:09,613
They're not to be trusted...

639
00:48:09,615 --> 00:48:13,216
and yet you accept water from
their hands, don't you?

640
00:48:13,218 --> 00:48:14,218
Yes...

641
00:48:14,220 --> 00:48:16,720
I told you to put two bullets
in their skulls,

642
00:48:16,722 --> 00:48:18,724
and take their fingers.

643
00:48:19,859 --> 00:48:22,158
Listen to what you're saying.

644
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:23,761
Taking fingers.

645
00:48:23,763 --> 00:48:26,732
Look at you.
You cower like a child!

646
00:48:27,867 --> 00:48:30,133
You're just a shadow of the
man I once knew.

647
00:48:30,135 --> 00:48:32,038
[breathing heavily]

648
00:48:45,852 --> 00:48:47,852
This ring...

649
00:48:47,854 --> 00:48:50,520
...a symbol of honor.

650
00:48:50,522 --> 00:48:53,957
It deems you more
than a mortal man.

651
00:48:53,959 --> 00:48:56,963
You don't deserve
to wear this anymore.

652
00:48:58,164 --> 00:48:59,932
All is lost for you.

653
00:49:02,068 --> 00:49:05,002
- But not them, they're not lost.
- No, please.

654
00:49:05,004 --> 00:49:06,736
Oh no...

655
00:49:06,738 --> 00:49:09,240
They watch you with their
beady little eyes.

656
00:49:09,242 --> 00:49:11,441
They watch you
while you write letters

657
00:49:11,443 --> 00:49:14,178
to your family and friends.

658
00:49:14,180 --> 00:49:16,980
And those pictures,
those photographs,

659
00:49:16,982 --> 00:49:19,919
that you hold so near and
dear to your heart...

660
00:49:21,254 --> 00:49:23,020
They will take them from you.

661
00:49:23,022 --> 00:49:26,426
They will take them from you
and they will burn them.

662
00:49:27,859 --> 00:49:32,296
So yes... that is why I take
their fingers.

663
00:49:32,298 --> 00:49:33,663
So they will never again

664
00:49:33,665 --> 00:49:35,866
pull the triggers
of their weapons

665
00:49:35,868 --> 00:49:37,734
against your brothers...

666
00:49:37,736 --> 00:49:39,372
my brothers.

667
00:49:40,406 --> 00:49:41,742
Please...

668
00:49:42,774 --> 00:49:44,410
The ring...

669
00:49:45,178 --> 00:49:47,444
The ring, Raven.

670
00:49:47,446 --> 00:49:49,849
Only the strong wear the
ring.

671
00:49:51,184 --> 00:49:52,850
Why have you forgotten it?

672
00:49:52,852 --> 00:49:54,187
[cries out]

673
00:50:00,225 --> 00:50:03,030
Ah... aah.

674
00:50:04,664 --> 00:50:07,334
Sir, untie me
so I can help you.

675
00:50:08,734 --> 00:50:09,966
Help...

676
00:50:09,968 --> 00:50:11,804
...help you say?

677
00:50:12,772 --> 00:50:13,941
Yes...

678
00:50:15,008 --> 00:50:17,810
I'm sure you heard the siege
on my bunker today.

679
00:50:18,977 --> 00:50:21,347
My enemies attacked me
like cowards.

680
00:50:23,783 --> 00:50:25,448
The same way
Booth attacked Lincoln

681
00:50:25,450 --> 00:50:26,819
at the theater.

682
00:50:27,854 --> 00:50:29,622
Like a coward.

683
00:50:41,100 --> 00:50:44,638
All of you will pay for the
attack on my home today.

684
00:50:46,039 --> 00:50:48,238
The weak, the useless...

685
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:50,140
my enemies...

686
00:50:50,142 --> 00:50:52,611
you all pay with your blood.

687
00:50:56,615 --> 00:50:59,518
I grow tired of raising
my hand against you.

688
00:51:01,254 --> 00:51:04,024
Now you all will raise your
hands against each other.

689
00:51:09,461 --> 00:51:11,529
You were like a son to me.

690
00:51:11,531 --> 00:51:14,497
You disappointed and hurt me
beyond words.

691
00:51:14,499 --> 00:51:16,000
But worst of all...

692
00:51:16,002 --> 00:51:19,736
your courage and commitment
perished.

693
00:51:19,738 --> 00:51:22,406
So, now...

694
00:51:22,408 --> 00:51:24,441
you will do your penance.

695
00:51:24,443 --> 00:51:26,946
You will fight
for your freedom.

696
00:51:29,214 --> 00:51:30,948
You both will fight
for your freedom.

697
00:51:30,950 --> 00:51:34,884
All there of you will fight
for your freedom.

698
00:51:34,886 --> 00:51:37,857
Last man standing
gets to live.

699
00:51:43,062 --> 00:51:45,665
Don't make any sudden
movements.

700
00:51:54,039 --> 00:51:56,776
Untie him. Untie him.

701
00:52:06,986 --> 00:52:08,789
Get back, get back.

702
00:52:12,892 --> 00:52:14,261
Begin.

703
00:52:14,660 --> 00:52:16,127
No! Agh!

704
00:52:16,129 --> 00:52:18,495
[grunting]

705
00:52:18,497 --> 00:52:19,965
Get up, get up!

706
00:52:48,026 --> 00:52:50,664
[choking]

707
00:52:54,734 --> 00:52:56,269
Get it over with!

708
00:53:09,281 --> 00:53:11,450
[coughing]
Oh God.

709
00:53:13,818 --> 00:53:15,586
Oh God, don't hurt me.

710
00:53:15,588 --> 00:53:17,654
I'm not God...

711
00:53:17,656 --> 00:53:19,758
but you will see Him
soon enough.

712
00:53:21,327 --> 00:53:23,129
[cries out]

713
00:53:24,863 --> 00:53:27,163
I will give you time
to bleed out,

714
00:53:27,165 --> 00:53:28,732
and think about the sins
you've committed

715
00:53:28,734 --> 00:53:30,403
against your country...

716
00:53:31,269 --> 00:53:32,035
Please...

717
00:53:32,037 --> 00:53:33,772
and your brothers.

718
00:53:43,950 --> 00:53:45,718
[gasps]

719
00:53:52,390 --> 00:53:54,093
Move, go on.

720
00:53:55,660 --> 00:53:56,826
[grunts]

721
00:53:56,828 --> 00:53:58,731
Shit's getting' thick up here.

722
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:03,267
Harwick, what's goin' on?
You alright?

723
00:54:03,269 --> 00:54:04,334
I gotta stop.

724
00:54:04,336 --> 00:54:06,438
What are you talkin' about?
We gotta keep going.

725
00:54:09,242 --> 00:54:10,975
I can't keep goin', man.

726
00:54:10,977 --> 00:54:12,243
Let's go.

727
00:54:12,245 --> 00:54:13,613
We gotta keep going.

728
00:54:14,647 --> 00:54:16,879
I'm fucking weak now, man.
I can't go anymore.

729
00:54:16,881 --> 00:54:18,214
Ly, grab his gun. Grab it.

730
00:54:18,216 --> 00:54:20,084
No! No, no, no, no, no.

731
00:54:20,086 --> 00:54:21,084
- Yes, Harwick.
- She don't get no gun.

732
00:54:21,086 --> 00:54:23,020
- Yes she does.
- Bullshit, I don't trust her.

733
00:54:23,022 --> 00:54:24,921
Aah!

734
00:54:24,923 --> 00:54:26,256
Harwick, what's wrong
with you?

735
00:54:26,258 --> 00:54:27,225
There's nothing there!

Aah.

Ready?

966
01:14:41,372 --> 01:14:43,842
How'd you know
how to use that radio?

[sighs]

968
01:14:46,377 --> 01:14:48,312
Ready?

The radio...

970
01:14:51,716 --> 01:14:54,352
How did you know
how to use it?

971
01:14:57,521 --> 01:15:00,555
Let's go. You must-
You must go.

01:15:06,964 --> 01:15:09,868
I too went to fight.

975
01:15:14,239 --> 01:15:17,676
I lost... all my family.

976
01:15:23,714 --> 01:15:25,851
I'm sorry.

977
01:15:28,720 --> 01:15:30,685
But now...

978
01:15:30,687 --> 01:15:33,355
I have to be strong...

979
01:15:33,357 --> 01:15:35,927

Let's go.

983
01:15:43,133 --> 01:15:45,334
What about the radio?

984
01:15:45,336 --> 01:15:46,538
Look at me.

985
01:15:48,205 --> 01:15:50,374
How'd you know
how to use the radio?

986
01:15:55,712 --> 01:15:57,913

Yes?

990
01:16:15,132 --> 01:16:16,568
When we get out of here...

991
01:16:18,369 --> 01:16:20,339
I'm gonna take you with me.

992
01:16:21,838 --> 01:16:23,171

Captain Dodge, sir.

A wire just came through

997
01:16:34,552 --> 01:16:37,752
about a Special Forces Unit
out in the Ho Bo Woods,

998
01:16:37,754 --> 01:16:40,092
operating in an NVA bunker.

999
01:16:50,068 --> 01:16:53,469
Arrange for a squad
for my arrival out there.

1000
01:16:53,471 --> 01:16:55,973
- Let's clean this mess up.
- Yes, sir.

1002
01:17:03,647 --> 01:17:05,583
My men...

1003
01:17:06,217 --> 01:17:07,586
Where are all my men?

1004
01:17:09,686 --> 01:17:12,587
The oath, the creed
you all took...

1005
01:17:12,589 --> 01:17:13,992
Fools!

1007
01:17:33,677 --> 01:17:35,646
Get over here!

1008
01:17:41,718 --> 01:17:42,818
You failed!

1009
01:17:42,820 --> 01:17:44,586
You should have killed them
when you had the chance!

1010
01:17:44,588 --> 01:17:45,587
Forgive me, sir.

1011
01:17:45,589 --> 01:17:47,159

01:18:22,360 --> 01:18:23,629
I ready.

1018
01:18:24,128 --> 01:18:25,631

Let's move.

1020
01:18:30,668 --> 01:18:31,733
Drop it!

Drop it!

1022
01:18:33,204 --> 01:18:34,469
- Take him.
- Sir.

1023
01:18:34,471 --> 01:18:37,038
I'll take this little spy bitch.
Get up!

It appears you've called
for help.

1031

The enemy's getting' closer.

1032

Go on, bring your numbers!
Get up!

No! Aah!

1036
01:19:23,553 --> 01:19:25,019
You've been protecting
the enemy!

1037
01:19:25,021 --> 01:19:27,825
This spy bitch! This traitor!

There's no reason to save
your bent nose.

1050
01:20:06,029 --> 01:20:07,362
Guilty.

1051
01:20:07,364 --> 01:20:08,429

He killed...

1061
01:21:12,096 --> 01:21:13,696
Sir, here's the foot locker
you requested.

1062
01:21:13,698 --> 01:21:14,665
Aah!

1063
01:21:16,266 --> 01:21:18,470
An A... An American did it?
What?

1064
01:21:19,470 --> 01:21:21,269
Jesus Christ.

1065
01:21:21,271 --> 01:21:22,670
Sir, this isn't charted,

1066
01:21:22,672 --> 01:21:24,673
do you want me to bring it
to attention?

1067
01:21:24,675 --> 01:21:27,645
What the fuck have you
been up to, Tiberius?

1068
01:21:28,712 --> 01:21:29,978
Are those fingers?

1069
01:21:29,980 --> 01:21:32,480
My man is missin' a finger.

1070
01:21:32,482 --> 01:21:34,015
Is this soldier collecting
'em?

1071
01:21:34,017 --> 01:21:35,486
Sergeant Hall!

1072
01:21:36,253 --> 01:21:40,723
You will log and chart...
nothing.

1073
01:21:40,725 --> 01:21:43,959
Your soul responsibility
is this foot locker.

1074
01:21:43,961 --> 01:21:45,329
Am I clear?

1075
01:21:46,998 --> 01:21:47,863
Yes, sir.

1076
01:21:47,865 --> 01:21:49,197
You hurt anywhere else
on your body?

1077
01:21:49,199 --> 01:21:50,032
[Han murmuring]

1078
01:21:50,034 --> 01:21:52,501
Alright, let's clean
this mess up!

1079
01:21:52,503 --> 01:21:54,673
They killed her...

1080
01:21:55,439 --> 01:21:56,971
Captain, you seem
to know a lot

1081
01:21:56,973 --> 01:21:59,541
about this Special Forces
soldier and the bunker.

1082
01:21:59,543 --> 01:22:01,876
We never gave you directions
on how to get here.

1083
01:22:01,878 --> 01:22:04,315
[murmuring]

1084
01:22:05,583 --> 01:22:07,081
You know...

1085
01:22:07,083 --> 01:22:07,950
Virgil...

1086
01:22:07,952 --> 01:22:09,788
I've forgotten more than
you know, okay?

1087
01:22:11,021 --> 01:22:13,925
I'm afraid, I'm gonna have to
document this in my report.

1088
01:22:17,962 --> 01:22:20,265
Let me see your weapon,
soldier.

1089
01:22:24,467 --> 01:22:26,001
You know, Sergeant...

1090
01:22:26,003 --> 01:22:27,769
you won't be documenting
anything.

1091
01:22:27,771 --> 01:22:28,839
[gunshot]

1092
01:22:33,311 --> 01:22:34,676
How's it goin'?

1093
01:22:34,678 --> 01:22:36,312
Let's get you the hell
out of here.

1094
01:22:36,314 --> 01:22:37,446
Ly... Ly... Ly!

1095
01:22:37,448 --> 01:22:39,517
Let's go. She's dead,
don't you worry.

1096
01:22:56,833 --> 01:22:58,168
Well...

1097
01:22:59,704 --> 01:23:02,874
Private Johannes Schenke.

1098
01:23:04,307 --> 01:23:06,675
Being as you're all healed up,

1099
01:23:06,677 --> 01:23:08,844
your new duty
is to drop back...

1100
01:23:08,846 --> 01:23:10,879
into that NVA area...

1101
01:23:10,881 --> 01:23:12,249
solo mission.

1102
01:23:13,150 --> 01:23:14,849
As you are aware...

1103
01:23:14,851 --> 01:23:17,152
There are more tunnels
in the outer sector.

1104
01:23:17,154 --> 01:23:20,421
And intel has told us
nothing about them.

1105
01:23:20,423 --> 01:23:24,359
Now, those tunnels
lead somewhere, son.

1106
01:23:24,361 --> 01:23:26,431
And we need to know where.

1107
01:23:27,364 --> 01:23:29,398
If you run into any
trouble...

1108
01:23:29,400 --> 01:23:31,169
not that I expect you to.

1109
01:23:32,369 --> 01:23:35,871
There an infantry division

1110
01:23:35,873 --> 01:23:38,072
...The Indians.

1111
01:23:38,074 --> 01:23:40,144
They're charting hot spots.

1112
01:23:41,212 --> 01:23:42,446
Cigar?

1113

at that bunker

1115

didn't happen.

1118
01:24:15,445 --> 01:24:16,914
It never occurred.

1119
01:24:18,516 --> 01:24:22,921
It's a... figment...
of the imagination.

1120
01:24:25,288 --> 01:24:26,955
Do we have
an understanding, son?

1121
01:24:26,957 --> 01:24:27,926
Yes, sir.

1122
01:24:30,194 --> 01:24:32,864
That bunker burned.

1123
01:24:35,332 --> 01:24:38,436
Along with all
of Tiberius' mayhem.

1124
01:24:40,303 --> 01:24:42,470
Everyone who ever set foot
in that bunker

1125
01:24:42,472 --> 01:24:44,708
is now dust or ash.

1126
01:24:48,812 --> 01:24:50,481
Except for you.

1127
01:24:58,021 --> 01:24:59,822
You have your orders.

1128
01:24:59,824 --> 01:25:01,092
Sir...

1129
01:25:13,604 --> 01:25:14,905
[door closes]

1130
01:25:19,743 --> 01:25:21,245
What if he talks?

1131
01:25:23,047 --> 01:25:25,880
He'll never make it
to Christmas.

1132
01:25:25,882 --> 01:25:27,282
That area's in the heart
of the jungle

1133
01:25:27,284 --> 01:25:30,221
and it will bleed him dry.

1134
01:25:33,089 --> 01:25:34,223
Now, no one...

1135
01:25:34,225 --> 01:25:36,625
must even find out what
happened with Tiberius

1136
01:25:36,627 --> 01:25:37,962
out in that bunker.

1137
01:25:41,431 --> 01:25:43,764
I sent him out to do ops.

1138
01:25:43,766 --> 01:25:45,836
Not to cut off fingers.

1139
01:25:53,644 --> 01:25:56,047
He lost his humanity
out there.

1140
01:25:59,550 --> 01:26:01,285
