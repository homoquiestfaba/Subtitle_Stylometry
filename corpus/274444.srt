1
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:16,340
( street activity )

2
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:25,580
( street activity stops )

3
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:09,300
( alarm goes off )

4
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:30,780
Man:
Testing, testing. One...

5
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:33,100
two... three.

6
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:40,820
Hello.

7
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:44,460
My name is Alan Gould.

8
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:47,500
If you're finding this tape,

9
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:50,500
you're probably a new race
that's gone through our cities

10
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:52,500
and noticed that everyone's...

11
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:53,940
dead. Oh.

12
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:56,500
Except for birds and bees--

13
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:58,820
things with wings that can fly.

14
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:03,140
Anyway, you're probably wondering:
"What the hell happened?!"

15
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:05,500
I don't know why I made it,

16
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:08,020
but I think
I can explain the rest.

17
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:17,500
Now... technically...
it could have been a lot of things.

18
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,340
A neutron weapon...

19
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:24,500
some kind of nerve agent.

20
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:26,940
We had plenty
of that one around.

21
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,500
Or maybe some sort of...

22
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:32,260
deadly virus
the government was studying.

23
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:35,100
Truthfully...

24
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:39,020
I don't know exactly
what happened.

25
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:41,340
But I do know this:

26
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:43,820
some fucker
ruined everything!

27
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:52,820
Sorry.

28
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:55,500
But what happened here...
and what happened

29
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:58,940
since the first time some guy
hit another guy with a rock,

30
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:02,300
all comes down to the fact
that someone...

31
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,260
didn't get loved.

32
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,260
So they got even.

33
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,500
So you don't think
I'm talking out of my ass--

34
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:17,500
'cause I'm the last guy--

35
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,500
I think that I have
some insight here.

36
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,620
Up until everything ended,

37
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:25,260
I was a graduate student
in anthropology.

38
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,740
I studied the Chetabi Indians

39
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,500
of the Brazilian rainforest.

40
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:32,620
This is them... that's me.

41
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:36,140
Now, the Chetabi
were very interesting

42
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:40,540
because they were primitive--
totally primitive.

43
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:43,500
I mean, seriously,
these people were scared of...

44
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:45,100
shiny things.

45
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:47,620
But they were... peaceful.

46
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:52,660
And they survived as a race

47
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:56,180
for 4000 years.

48
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:01,580
Now... what did the Chetabi know,
that we didn't?

49
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:05,740
The Chetabi understood
that when you became attached,

50
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:09,020
when you cared
too much for things,

51
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,220
or for people...

52
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:15,220
that eventually,
you would be crushed...

53
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:19,380
when you lost them.
This would cause hate...

54
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:20,940
and envy.

55
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:24,060
And so, they developed...
Goyen Hai,

56
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,700
the principle of detachment.

57
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:31,500
And they managed to get over...
needy emotions.

58
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,900
I mean,
that is this guy's wife!

59
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:38,780
Now, what happened is a crime.

60
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:41,500
It's a horrible fucking thing.

61
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:43,500
'Cause I'm stuck out here,
living in the woods,

62
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:45,500
'cause it's too depressing
downtown.

63
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:48,940
My whole life has become
some giant Twilight Zone episode!

64
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:00,540
You never get a second chance
at certain things.

65
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:03,500
But it's all right.
I'm okay.

66
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:07,140
Because, fortunately, having studied
the Chetabi for six years,

67
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:10,820
two on scholarship,
I think I have mastered detachment.

68
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:13,660
I definitely got that down.

69
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:16,980
But I can't let this
happen again.

70
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:20,420
So, hopefully,
this tape will be a way for me

71
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:22,980
to pass along
what I've learned...

72
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:27,420
so you guys don't wind up
killing each other.

73
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:30,460
Well, that's it.
But I think this will be fun!

74
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,860
- ( turns on siren )
- Woo-hoo!

75
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,460
** This is the time **

76
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:46,220
** I remember **

77
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:49,580
** First day of school **

78
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:53,420
** Sweet September **

79
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:57,420
** We fell in love **

80
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,340
** In the summer **

81
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,500
** I'm still hearing **

82
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:08,500
** All the kids whisper... **

83
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:10,300
( paper rustling )

84
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,420
( oven door opening )

85
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:14,420
( oven door closing )

86
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,020
( beeping )

87
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:37,060
( rattling )

88
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:42,500
** ...Now it seems **

89
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:44,660
** Like such a bad dream **

90
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:49,380
** Come back, come back,
right back to me **

91
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:56,500
** You don't even know, people **

92
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:58,660
** What it feels like... **

93
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:02,420
It's amazing how long
this stuff stays fresh.

94
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:08,420
It's funny, you know?

95
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:11,260
All this is mine.

96
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:15,260
I should feel free
to do whatever I want.

97
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:18,220
What the hell,
it doesn't mean anything.

98
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:04,180
How are you? It's the midnight show
here at the Last Man Lounge,

99
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:07,940
and I'm taking requests.
Anybody?

100
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:10,860
Hello? Hello?
Is this thing on?

101
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:14,500
I guess it's dead
out there tonight,

102
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:16,500
so I'll play
one of my favorites.

103
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:19,860
I hope it's one of yours.
It goes something like this...

104
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:23,620
( plays Beethoven sonata )

105
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:05,020
It occurred to me that I let
a few emotions slide yesterday.

106
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:09,340
But I want you to know
that no matter what,

107
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,500
I will not edit this tape.

108
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:13,860
The Chetabi
achieved detachment

109
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:17,500
by making everyone reveal...

110
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:19,460
their hidden feelings,

111
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:21,500
no matter how embarrassing.

112
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:23,500
The shame would
eventually wear off.

113
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:25,500
Which is why
I am now preparing...

114
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,940
for this Chetabi
humility ritual.

115
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:32,260
When a secret bad thought
was discovered,

116
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:35,940
the offender was covered in mud...

117
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:38,300
to single him out.

118
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:41,540
And then it was felt
that public... masturbation

119
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:45,660
would add a deeper layer...

120
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:48,020
of shame...

121
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:50,500
and cleanse the soul...

122
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:52,340
of evil thoughts...

123
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,300
and foolish pride.

124
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:58,780
So...

125
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:08,420
This may take a minute.
I have to think back.

126
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:10,500
But I'm comfortable with it.

127
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:11,780
I am.

128
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:17,500
I'm not trying
to justify anything,

129
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:19,420
but this mud is cold.

130
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:24,940
- ( woman screams )
- Alan: Wait!

131
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:27,140
Woman: No! No!

132
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:29,500
- No!
- Alan: Wait! Wait!

133
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:30,780
Wait!

134
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,700
- ( woman screams )
- Wait!

135
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:02,500
Our Father Who art in Heaven,
hallowed be Thy name.

136
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:05,380
Forgive me, please,
forgive me. I'm sorry...

137
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:07,500
It's all right.

138
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:09,180
It's all right!

139
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:11,620
I'm not going to hurt you!

140
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,460
I'm from the Bay area!

141
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:20,860
Oh God!

142
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:24,180
( woman weeps )

143
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,780
I went to my mother's house...

144
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:30,700
and she was in the shower...

145
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:34,260
all twisted up...

146
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:37,460
lying in the bottom...

147
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:40,300
the water running.

148
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:43,020
My mother--

149
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:05,220
Alan: It's okay.

150
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:06,980
It's okay.

151
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:10,260
Woman: I'm sorry.

152
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:12,980
I'm sorry.

153
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:14,900
I just--

154
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:17,580
when I first saw you, I--

155
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:21,860
I thought
I was being punished.

156
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,820
No, you're not
being punished.

157
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:27,180
You seem great.

158
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,300
You don't know me.

159
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,420
Look, what happened--

160
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:35,580
it was everybody's fault.

161
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:40,620
It's stupid fucking pride.

162
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:42,740
Yes.

163
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:46,500
That's what caused
the accident.

164
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:47,700
No.

165
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:50,460
It wasn't an accident.

166
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:54,340
God was angry.
He wanted to leave me alone.

167
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,020
And then...

168
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:04,740
when I saw you,
all covered,

169
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:07,420
and with the smoke...

170
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:10,380
I thought you were--

171
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:11,740
God?

172
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:13,700
No.

173
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:17,660
But you seem decent.
You're a decent person, right?

174
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:23,820
So then, maybe I have a chance.

175
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:31,060
There we go.

176
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:33,380
Day-- I don't know--

177
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:34,780
five?

178
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:36,500
Hi, guys.

179
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:39,260
The camera's been off
for a little while.

180
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:42,500
Sorry about that.
But I met this terrific girl.

181
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:45,100
And we had to get
to know each other.

182
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:47,740
I'll get back to you on that.

183
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:51,500
I first want you to meet her.
Sarah? Come here.

184
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:53,900
You'll love her.
She's terrific.

185
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:55,820
Sarah?

186
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:59,140
( both laugh )

187
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:01,740
So--

188
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:10,660
Anyway, Sarah is going
to stay with us for a while.

189
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:14,100
- For a long while.
- He's very good.

190
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:16,420
He's a very good man.

191
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:21,340
And I explained to her that we are
making this serious documentary--

192
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:24,820
Do you know
about the Chetabi?

193
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:27,500
They were Indians.
( mimics Indians )

194
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:29,060
No, come on.

195
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:31,500
This serious documentary

196
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:33,940
on how not
to screw up the Earth.

197
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:37,060
So, tell them
about yourself, Sarah.

198
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:40,500
I don't want to film now.

199
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,500
No, come on,
you're a fresh face.

200
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:44,500
They want to see a fresh,
beautiful face.

201
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:46,580
Tell them about yourself.

202
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:52,100
Alan: Okay...

203
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:55,220
I guess you guys
don't need to see that.

204
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:37,500
Hi. It's still day five.

205
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:40,420
Sarah nodded off,
so I thought we could talk.

206
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:45,420
She's something, huh?

207
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:47,540
I mean, she's... pretty,

208
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:50,860
and smart,
and incredibly sexy.

209
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:55,380
A little mixed up philosophically,
but what can you expect right now?

210
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:57,500
She seems
to have fallen for me.

211
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:58,940
It was...

212
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:01,780
a meant-to-be thing,
I think.

213
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:05,620
We spent the whole day
just talking about stuff...

214
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:07,940
you know?

215
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:11,500
Then we tried to figure out things
we had in common,

216
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:14,060
to see why we survived.
It turns out

217
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:16,500
it's either
an allergy to ragweed,

218
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:19,020
or the fact
that we both take zinc.

219
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:22,220
But she's great.

220
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:24,500
She's got
this cute little laugh.

221
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:26,460
God, I love her laugh.

222
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:32,420
We made love tonight.

223
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:35,380
It was unbelievable!

224
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:38,500
I'm really not surprised
things turned out like this.

225
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:41,100
Itjust proves
the Chetabi were right.

226
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:44,220
They say:
"Expect nothing from the sky,

227
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:47,980
and it will bring you
cool rain."

228
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:52,980
So, have no expectations, my friends!
It works gangbusters!

229
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:03,460
Good morning, sweetie.
Breakfast is coming up.

230
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:12,060
Well... you seem
a little tired out.

231
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:15,740
So...
whenever you're ready.

232
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:18,460
** Where's my baby? **

233
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,500
** Pretty little baby **

234
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:24,260
** Here's my baby,
pulling up here now **

235
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:28,020
** My friend Jack
is on the make **

236
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,500
** Yes, he stole
my last two dates **

237
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:32,660
** Gotta leave this town **

238
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:35,500
** Gotta leave this town **

239
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:38,580
** Gotta leave town
and move to someplace new. **

240
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:02,060
Here you go.
I made them Florentine.

241
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:04,700
The garnish is fake, though.

242
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:07,060
Oops, sorry.

243
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:19,100
So, we...
had some drinks last night.

244
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:23,740
Yes.

245
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:29,940
And we...

246
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:32,220
had a good time.

247
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:37,940
I've never felt closer
to anyone.

248
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:43,460
That's good. I just...

249
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:46,500
still feel
a little sick is all.

250
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:48,900
Well, you've been
through a lot.

251
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:50,860
Okay...

252
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,500
you go back to bed
and I'll clean up here.

253
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:57,100
And later, we can go into town
and you can pick some stuff up.

254
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:00,780
Okay.

255
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:04,820
Hii...

256
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:11,060
Hii... ya...

257
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:15,060
Hii... ya...

258
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:19,180
Don't you have anything
kind of modern?

259
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:21,500
This is a Chetabi
love ritual.

260
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:23,900
The second hour
really picks up.

261
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:39,220
( radio static )

262
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:01,300
- ( soft music playing )
- This isn't bad.

263
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:24,100
- It's flapping.
- It's not flapping.

264
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:25,500
I can feel it
flapping in the wind.

265
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:28,500
We can't hold it.
We should have tied it down better.

266
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:31,300
- Don't worry. It's fine.
- It's not fine!

267
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:39,460
What's wrong with you?

268
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:43,580
We can get another table.

269
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:19,940
No, Alan.

270
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:22,500
I still feel sort of...

271
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:23,860
peaked.

272
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:29,180
But we drank
three nights ago, sweetie.

273
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:33,820
I know.
That's how it gets me.

274
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:43,380
The thing is, Sarah,

275
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:46,180
since you feel
that God is behind this,

276
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:50,780
that I would think you'd feel
sort of a responsibility

277
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:53,500
in a biblical way to...

278
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:56,380
propagate the Earth.

279
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:59,140
Come on, Alan.

280
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:04,340
What? We're going to have a child?
Who will they have children with?

281
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:06,380
Another one of ours?

282
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:09,900
Start a whole race
of imbeciles.

283
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:14,140
Yeah, if you're going
to logic it out.

284
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:54,100
Don't be mad.

285
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:58,500
Hi.

286
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:00,940
Something's not right
with Sarah.

287
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:04,500
I'm not expecting anything.

288
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:07,980
But still, everything was going fine
on days four and five.

289
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:11,260
But by day seven,

290
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:13,500
she started in
with these moods.

291
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:15,180
She's not as...

292
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:17,220
open as she was.

293
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:20,500
I mean, everything
started off great.

294
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:23,100
But I feel almost
like there's this--

295
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:25,540
this... thistle traps...

296
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:30,500
are what the Chetabi
used to capture the rodents,

297
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:32,620
thus keeping them fresh...

298
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:35,620
for the big evening roast.

299
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:39,060
Well, that about covers
the traps...

300
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:41,300
and the big roast.

301
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:44,380
We'll talk about
after-dinner dancing later.

302
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:06,900
Morning.

303
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:08,900
Morning.

304
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:11,380
How are you feeling?

305
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:16,180
Listen, there's something
I want to do.

306
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:18,500
I'd like to use
the camera for a while.

307
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:20,940
I think
it'll make things better.

308
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:22,500
Sure.

309
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:24,700
I'll film anything you want.

310
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:27,380
No, this is private.

311
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:30,660
I'd like to film by myself.

312
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:32,500
Oh.

313
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:33,780
Okay.

314
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:53,700
Hi.

315
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:55,980
I'm Sarah.

316
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:58,300
We've already met,

317
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:00,180
but not really.

318
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:05,500
I wanted to talk to you
a little bit

319
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:08,220
about the way
you handle things in life.

320
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:11,100
Alan, please!

321
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:20,900
What I wanted
was to warn you...

322
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:24,420
about people like me.

323
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:33,260
** You believe **

324
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:37,220
** You can do **

325
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:39,780
** Nothing to save yourseIf **

326
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:46,100
** You've got demons,
you need him **

327
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:50,300
** And you're afraid
to trust yourself. **

328
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:14,300
- Hey.
- Morning.

329
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:20,500
Powdered eggs Benedict.

330
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:24,500
That's absolutely delicious!

331
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:27,140
What do you say
we take a little ride?

332
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:28,780
Sure.

333
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:36,500
I've got this great idea!

334
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:37,500
Cool!

335
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:38,500
What?

336
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:40,700
We'll go find
other people!

337
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:49,500
Wait! Sarah!

338
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:51,500
We both know what the story
is out there.

339
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:54,100
You drove halfway
across the country!

340
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:57,140
I found you.
There's got to be others.

341
00:28:57,500 --> 00:28:59,740
- But--
- We owe it to them.

342
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:02,260
But, what about--

343
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:05,220
Last night, we--

344
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:10,500
I don't want you
to get disappointed.

345
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:11,500
What?!

346
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:13,500
What is really going on,
Sarah?

347
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:16,500
And don't tell me
it's last week's tequila shots,

348
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:19,500
because that's wearing
a little thin. What is wrong?

349
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:21,340
- Nothing.
- Bull!

350
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:24,060
You've been acting
strange for days.

351
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:26,860
Well, maybe
I am strange, Alan.

352
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:30,660
Who do you think I am, huh?

353
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:36,100
You think I'm just some good-looking
girl from across the bar?

354
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:39,500
Or some Penthouse fantasy
you just lucked into?

355
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:43,500
What the hell
are you talking about?!

356
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:45,100
I don't know.

357
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:51,020
I'm scared.

358
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:54,940
Which is it, that I don't know you,
or that you're scared?

359
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:00,780
Maybe it's your big underwear.

360
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:06,140
It was a joke.

361
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:12,220
Alan. I'm sorry.

362
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:13,500
Sorry.

363
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:15,620
Please, give me some time.

364
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:18,980
I just need
to think about things.

365
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:22,540
We'll leave after lunch.

366
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:39,060
Look, Sarah.

367
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:41,500
I knew this would happen.

368
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:42,980
I'm sorry.

369
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:45,740
We just have to accept that--

370
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:48,740
that we only have each other.

371
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:51,220
But that's okay.

372
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:53,140
We'll be fine.

373
00:30:57,500 --> 00:30:59,380
Don't ever leave me.

374
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:07,700
Alan: Well, Sarah and I
finally started settling in.

375
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:12,940
I guess things don't always flow
exactly the way you plan,

376
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:15,860
which is why you shouldn't plan.

377
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:25,700
But it's very clear that
she's attracted underneath.

378
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:29,940
So if she needs some time
to tap into her feelings for me,

379
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:32,060
that's fine.

380
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:35,740
As the Chetabi say,
"If you want to fence in a goat,

381
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:38,900
give it plenty of grazing land."

382
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:44,900
Still...

383
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:48,620
I'm not sure why I have
to sleep out here for now.

384
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:51,500
The whole thing
is very confusing.

385
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:54,020
What is it she needs
to figure out?

386
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:56,500
Sure, I've got my problems...

387
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:58,740
I sweat a lot, can't deny it;

388
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:02,020
love handles, yeah,
I've got those;

389
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:03,820
but...

390
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:06,940
I am the last guy
on Earth, okay?

391
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:11,780
** What the world needs now **

392
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:15,580
** Is love, sweet love **

393
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:19,500
** It's the only thing **

394
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:22,100
** That there's just
too little of **

395
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:25,780
** What the world needs now **

396
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:28,620
** Is love, sweet love. **

397
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:33,500
Alan:
Know thatjust the sound--

398
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:35,540
Oh my God! Stop! Stop! !

399
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:48,500
Man: Hey...

400
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:50,380
thanks for stopping.

401
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:52,700
Hi.

402
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:55,500
Yeah,
I'm glad you guys stopped.

403
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:58,460
I wasn't getting any rides.
My name's Raphael.

404
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:02,820
Rides?

405
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:08,220
He doesn't know.

406
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:14,140
A nerve agent?

407
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:19,020
Sarah: No.
It was something bigger.

408
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:21,020
It was God,

409
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:24,500
I think, starting over.

410
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:27,380
How come I survived?

411
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:29,100
I don't know.

412
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:31,500
- Are you allergic to ragweed?
- No.

413
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:33,260
Do you take zinc?

414
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:35,780
Yeah.

415
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:38,900
There's a reason
for everything.

416
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:41,820
Jesus.

417
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:43,940
My mom...

418
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:48,460
and my brother Todd...

419
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:52,460
we had this whole plan

420
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:55,740
to build our own putt-putt
goIf course out in Oregon.

421
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:00,460
I was on my way there.

422
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:11,900
I never got
to meet Roy Orbison.

423
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:14,780
He...

424
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:17,780
actually died before all this.

425
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:20,500
What?

426
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:22,860
- Are you all right?
- I guess.

427
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:28,500
Maybe I just need
a minute alone,

428
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:31,300
- as retarded as that sounds.
- It's okay.

429
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:08,940
I'm okay.

430
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:11,580
Jeez, that's pretty good.

431
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:14,500
It'll be like camping forever.

432
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:16,300
Well, that's true.

433
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:18,900
That's one way
of looking at it.

434
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:21,460
Will you stay with us?

435
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:25,340
I will never leave.

436
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:33,100
Alan:
There's been a new development.

437
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:35,500
We discovered a third person.

438
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:37,380
His name is Raphael.

439
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:43,500
We saw him hitchhiking
and immediately stopped.

440
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:46,420
Shockingly, he didn't know
what had happened.

441
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:50,500
He was a little shy
of the casualties at first,

442
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:53,220
but quickly nicknamed
them "grippers."

443
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:01,300
He seems eager to make
the best of things,

444
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:05,140
although I admit
I have some concerns.

445
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:14,700
without getting frustrated--

446
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:18,460
not that it could be challenged
at this point.

447
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:21,740
But he seems like a good guy.

448
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:30,740
I don't expect any surprises.

449
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:47,500
Still, on the way home,

450
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:51,100
he was telling these endless stories
from when he was camping,

451
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:54,500
like how he set his own broken
wrist with wet bark.

452
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:56,820
Sarah tried hard to be patient,

453
00:36:57,500 --> 00:36:59,500
and he could take that
as something else.

454
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:01,380
But I'm not worried.

455
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:06,940
It'll be good having someone new
around to show the ropes.

456
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:09,620
( Raphael sings Reveille )

457
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:13,500
Raphael: It's wake up time.

458
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:14,500
Hey...

459
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:16,860
breakfast is burning.
Let's go.

460
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:23,380
Sarah: Good morning.

461
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:34,180
Man, flapjacks.

462
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:38,100
Did you know
who they're named after?

463
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:40,620
- Jack Dempsey.
- Really?

464
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:43,500
I thought it was before then,
during the Civil War--

465
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:47,300
No, it was Dempsey. 'Cause of the way
he'd pound guys into the mat.

466
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:51,060
They'd all yell,
"Flap 'em, Jack!"

467
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:52,940
Flap 'em?

468
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:55,940
You mean,
"Flatten them, Jack"?

469
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:58,260
No, "Flap 'em."

470
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:00,500
You know,
with your flaps.

471
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:03,420
Plus, their faces
looked like pancakes after.

472
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:04,780
Ouch!

473
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:09,860
Hey, work detail
in 20 minutes.

474
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:18,540
That's enough blueberry.

475
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:21,980
Next up...

476
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:24,060
boysenberry.

477
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:26,380
Man, this ain't bad!

478
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:45,500
** Well, I'm country good,
and I'm city fast **

479
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:47,500
** I'm ready-made
and built to last **

480
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:50,500
** Just a local unarmed guard
you've come to find **

481
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:52,500
** Skyscraper low
and backwoods high **

482
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:54,500
** I'm standing still
and floating by **

483
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:57,340
** Defending to my death
what always was **

484
00:38:57,500 --> 00:39:00,500
** I'm defending to my death
what always was **

485
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:04,540
** I'm defending to my death
what always was. **

486
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:08,940
I just think
it's a little silly.

487
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:11,260
We eat every day.

488
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:13,500
Why such a big deal tonight,

489
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:16,500
filming the whole thing,
and with this costume ball?

490
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:19,020
Sarah:
Come on, I think it's sweet.

491
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:21,500
We spent the whole afternoon
fixing the place up.

492
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:24,500
- He just wants to celebrate.
- Invitations, Sarah?

493
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:26,500
Is this Gilligan's Island?

494
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:29,980
- Sarah: Have a little fun.
- I know how to have fun, okay?

495
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:31,900
Woo-hoo!

496
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:35,020
That's fun!
This is just show-offy.

497
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:44,620
( oriental music playing )

498
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:48,260
- Alan: Wow.
- Sarah: Check it out, Alan.

499
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:51,460
Raphael: Pull up a pillow
and take a load off.

500
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:54,220
Sarah: Oh my God.
I cannot believe this.

501
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:56,220
This is amazing.

502
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:07,020
I may have misjudged
the situation.

503
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:12,300
I have a very peaceful nature,
but Raphael is getting on my nerves,

504
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:15,500
telling these stupid stories
every two seconds,

505
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:17,500
and all this other childish crap.

506
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:20,060
He's changing everything.
And Sarah!

507
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:24,100
Acting like it's funny, as though
she could be charmed by him.

508
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:27,660
You think I'm crazy?
Here, I'll show you something.

509
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:31,020
I'll go now
to a direct video feed.

510
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:33,500
This is us,
just having dinner.

511
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:36,500
Raphael: ...And I finally realized,
that was no stuffed rabbit.

512
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:38,620
And those weren't raisins.

513
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:42,500
Wait, that doesn't make
any sense.

514
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:44,500
Raphael and Sarah:
Chee chaw!

515
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:47,500
Alan: What is this "chee chaw" stuff?
What does it mean?

516
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:50,180
It's like some little
"inside" thing.

517
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:53,700
When did they get the time
to work out inside jokes?

518
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:56,980
Did I ever tell you
about the time

519
00:40:57,500 --> 00:40:58,500
when I set
my own broken wrist?

520
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:00,380
Yeah, the other day.

521
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:03,500
Well, I set it with bark.

522
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:05,500
I almost sprained
my ankle up there too.

523
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:08,500
You've got to be careful,
because with a sprained ankle,

524
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:11,500
out in the woods,
it's worse than appendicitis.

525
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:14,460
- Why?
- With a bad appendix, you've a chance.

526
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:17,500
But with a sprained ankle,
you get caught out there,

527
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:20,500
you just lay there
till you get found by animals.

528
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:22,300
That's ridiculous.

529
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:25,940
You could make crutches
out of tree trunks and hobble out!

530
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:28,500
- Sarah: God.
- That's ridiculous.

531
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:31,940
You could make crutches
out of tree trunks and hobble out.

532
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:35,500
But if your appendix bursts,
you'd be finished.

533
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:38,500
But how will you find tree trunks
if you can't walk?

534
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:40,780
You crawl around
on your back

535
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:43,500
and you chop them down.

536
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:44,500
You chop them down
on your back?

537
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:47,140
Yeah, you lay there
and you chop them.

538
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:49,500
It'll take a while,
but you've got time.

539
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:52,420
Alan: Did you see the way
she jumped in there

540
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:55,420
and defended him like that?
And watch this...

541
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:58,700
It's not like it's
the end of the world or anything.

542
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:03,500
Alan:
Look at her body position.

543
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:06,300
She was fully standing,
completely stable,

544
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:09,060
and yet he holds on!
And now look...

545
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:13,500
See that?! See that?!

546
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:14,780
A-ha!

547
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:17,500
See? Something is not right.

548
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:20,740
I can't understand what's going
through Sarah's head.

549
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:23,660
What could she be thinking?

550
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:27,460
Something's not right.

551
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:39,500
Sarah: I wanted to talk
to you a little about...

552
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:42,020
the way you handle things
in life--

553
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:44,180
relationships--

554
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:46,260
because there's--

555
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:48,100
Alan, please!

556
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:52,900
What I wanted
was to warn you...

557
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:56,420
about people like me.

558
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:07,100
It's Michael.

559
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:09,300
We used to go out.

560
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:13,340
He was a great guy.

561
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:16,460
He was crazy about me.

562
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:22,140
He's dead now.

563
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:26,180
I feel like I--

564
00:43:29,500 --> 00:43:31,980
I killed him
a little bit first...

565
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:36,700
by sleeping with his friend.

566
00:43:39,500 --> 00:43:42,860
I did the same kind of thing
to my old roommate, Sharon.

567
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:48,820
And...

568
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:51,340
a few other people.

569
00:43:57,500 --> 00:43:59,420
I have some problems.

570
00:44:02,500 --> 00:44:04,100
I'm a very...

571
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:07,060
weak person.

572
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:12,820
That's why
I'm being punished.

573
00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:17,420
But I can't be alone.

574
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:24,460
I'm scared about Alan.

575
00:44:30,500 --> 00:44:33,140
itjust...
doesn't feel right with him.

576
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:36,340
You know how he is.

577
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:39,500
And physically, it's just--

578
00:44:39,500 --> 00:44:42,140
I keep hoping
my feelings will change,

579
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:45,260
but it's so hard.

580
00:44:45,500 --> 00:44:47,500
I know if he finds out,
he'll leave me alone,

581
00:44:47,500 --> 00:44:50,300
but I've got
to do things right this time.

582
00:44:54,500 --> 00:44:57,020
I have to try
to find other people.

583
00:44:58,500 --> 00:45:01,140
I've got to try
to find other people--

584
00:45:27,500 --> 00:45:29,460
( loud music playing )

585
00:45:39,500 --> 00:45:41,500
Alan: Okay.
I know what you're thinking.

586
00:45:41,500 --> 00:45:44,500
You're thinking I shouldn't be
installing these cameras,

587
00:45:44,500 --> 00:45:48,180
but if people are going to have secrets,
I have a right to know,

588
00:45:48,500 --> 00:45:51,500
because when you have secrets,
there is no detachment.

589
00:45:51,500 --> 00:45:55,100
And without detachment,
you have a planet full of dead people.

590
00:45:55,500 --> 00:45:57,500
So, things must be watched,

591
00:45:57,500 --> 00:46:00,340
until all these secrets
can be flushed out.

592
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:03,580
And only then can we have open,
honest behavior--

593
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:06,500
Raphael:
What are you doing?

594
00:46:06,500 --> 00:46:07,980
Nothing...

595
00:46:08,500 --> 00:46:11,500
- just a little Chetabi work.
- Thank you for that disco ball.

596
00:46:11,500 --> 00:46:14,500
- It looks great in Rancho Raphael.
- Sure, sure.

597
00:46:14,500 --> 00:46:16,740
How about a relaxation break?

598
00:46:17,500 --> 00:46:20,500
- I'll really have to catch up.
- Come on. Come on.

599
00:46:20,500 --> 00:46:23,140
I want to talk to you
about something.

600
00:46:26,500 --> 00:46:29,020
So, you had something
on your mind?

601
00:46:30,500 --> 00:46:32,500
I was thinking about
how we're really alone.

602
00:46:32,500 --> 00:46:34,620
You mean, philosophically?

603
00:46:35,500 --> 00:46:38,540
No, I mean... how there aren't
any other people.

604
00:46:39,500 --> 00:46:40,860
Uh-huh.

605
00:46:41,500 --> 00:46:44,340
And I realized
we might have some problems.

606
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:50,100
In what ways?

607
00:46:54,500 --> 00:46:55,500
I mean, like together.

608
00:46:55,500 --> 00:46:57,500
With you, me and Sarah.

609
00:47:00,500 --> 00:47:01,780
Yeah?

610
00:47:02,500 --> 00:47:06,260
I was kind of concerned, because
there's this back and forth thing

611
00:47:06,500 --> 00:47:08,900
going on between
Sarah and me...

612
00:47:11,500 --> 00:47:14,860
and I didn't want to mess up
anything you guys have got.

613
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:17,620
You were together first...

614
00:47:18,500 --> 00:47:21,700
and I don't want to interfere
like some homewrecker.

615
00:47:22,500 --> 00:47:23,500
Oh...

616
00:47:23,500 --> 00:47:25,620
I understand how you feel.

617
00:47:29,500 --> 00:47:32,300
'Cause I know how you try
to be spiritual,

618
00:47:32,500 --> 00:47:35,900
but it seemed like you might have
slipped and gotjealous.

619
00:47:36,500 --> 00:47:37,500
Oh no...

620
00:47:37,500 --> 00:47:40,300
that's just
a little flu thing that I had.

621
00:47:41,500 --> 00:47:44,500
No, no, there's no problem.
Sarah and I have...

622
00:47:44,500 --> 00:47:47,580
a solid understanding.
I'm not possessive of her.

623
00:47:48,500 --> 00:47:52,020
We're above all that.
When you follow a spiritual framework,

624
00:47:52,500 --> 00:47:53,500
there's no jealousy anymore.

625
00:47:53,500 --> 00:47:56,460
- You might want to do some reading.
- Thanks.

626
00:48:00,500 --> 00:48:02,500
Raphey's not really a bad guy.

627
00:48:02,500 --> 00:48:04,460
Bright even, in a way.

628
00:48:05,500 --> 00:48:08,500
Just a little confused, but
you have to give people a break.

629
00:48:08,500 --> 00:48:11,620
And Sarah, I sensed
that she was going stir-crazy,

630
00:48:15,500 --> 00:48:19,300
but she just needed to meet a new
person, get it out of her system.

631
00:48:19,500 --> 00:48:23,100
Raphael has taken her out
for a picnic to set things straight.

632
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:25,900
I guess
he'll let her down easy.

633
00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:30,180
She'll be fine.

634
00:48:30,500 --> 00:48:33,460
Then, everything will be
back to normal again.

635
00:48:35,500 --> 00:48:37,140
It'll be good.

636
00:48:39,500 --> 00:48:40,980
It's 7:30.

637
00:48:41,500 --> 00:48:43,420
They aren't back yet.

638
00:48:43,500 --> 00:48:46,340
It could be kind of a late,
dinnery picnic.

639
00:48:47,500 --> 00:48:50,580
There's no rule that says
picnic has to be lunch.

640
00:48:51,500 --> 00:48:54,180
Besides,
they have a lot to talk about.

641
00:48:54,500 --> 00:48:55,980
It's fine.

642
00:48:56,500 --> 00:48:58,340
Okay, it's 1 1 :00.

643
00:48:58,500 --> 00:49:00,500
and that does not concern me
from any standpoint

644
00:49:00,500 --> 00:49:02,500
other than a safety concern,

645
00:49:02,500 --> 00:49:04,500
which is why I am routinely
checking the area

646
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:06,500
in case of an accident.

647
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:12,500
It's 4:30
in the fucking morning!

648
00:49:12,500 --> 00:49:14,220
Where are they?!

649
00:49:14,500 --> 00:49:17,060
I should have gone!
I'm such a fool!

650
00:49:17,500 --> 00:49:20,100
"Give people a break"!
Forget that!

651
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:22,260
That is canceled!

652
00:49:37,500 --> 00:49:39,060
( sniffing )

653
00:49:43,500 --> 00:49:45,980
- Raphael: Want some?
- Sarah: No.

654
00:49:47,500 --> 00:49:49,780
Raphael:
There's plenty more.

655
00:49:54,500 --> 00:49:57,220
So what are you going
to tell Mr. Magoo?

656
00:49:57,500 --> 00:49:59,700
- Leave him alone.
- Sorry.

657
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:04,380
Didn't mean nothing.

658
00:50:05,500 --> 00:50:06,980
Come here.

659
00:50:07,500 --> 00:50:09,380
Come on, Mary Ann...

660
00:50:09,500 --> 00:50:10,980
come here.

661
00:50:11,500 --> 00:50:12,980
Come here.

662
00:50:39,500 --> 00:50:40,900
Morning.

663
00:50:41,500 --> 00:50:43,540
Got to use the bathroom.

664
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:48,460
Kind of a crazy night.

665
00:50:48,500 --> 00:50:50,500
Who would have figured?

666
00:50:51,500 --> 00:50:54,100
I guess I really
didn't know I was...

667
00:50:54,500 --> 00:50:55,900
in love.

668
00:50:57,500 --> 00:50:59,540
I kind of owe it to you.

669
00:51:01,500 --> 00:51:04,500
I wouldn't have made a move
hadn't you okayed it...

670
00:51:04,500 --> 00:51:07,460
by telling me you were
non-possessive and all.

671
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:12,020
So, thanks.

672
00:51:22,500 --> 00:51:24,420
I see my mistake now.

673
00:51:24,500 --> 00:51:26,540
Trying to be a nice guy.

674
00:51:27,500 --> 00:51:31,060
Even the Chetabi were prepared
for the battle against nature.

675
00:51:31,500 --> 00:51:34,500
"When the hunter goes against
the bull cricket or the tree weevil,

676
00:51:34,500 --> 00:51:36,380
hands are fair game.

677
00:51:36,500 --> 00:51:38,500
But against the lion
or the viper,

678
00:51:38,500 --> 00:51:40,980
he knows to add
claws and fangs."

679
00:51:42,500 --> 00:51:45,180
This guy doesn't have
anything over me.

680
00:51:45,500 --> 00:51:48,140
We're going to turn
this puppy around.

681
00:51:48,500 --> 00:51:50,820
** Well, I'm a lovesick fool **

682
00:51:51,500 --> 00:51:54,220
** I graduated
from Heartbreak school **

683
00:51:56,500 --> 00:51:58,780
** I do the best that I can **

684
00:52:00,500 --> 00:52:03,260
** But then I see you
with another man **

685
00:52:05,500 --> 00:52:07,780
** You know it's hurting me **

686
00:52:09,500 --> 00:52:12,740
** Yeah, you're pretending
that you just don't see **

687
00:52:14,500 --> 00:52:16,740
** How can you be so cruel **

688
00:52:18,500 --> 00:52:20,580
** To a lovesick fool? **

689
00:52:24,500 --> 00:52:27,460
** Well, I do, I do,
I do, I do, I do, I do **

690
00:52:27,500 --> 00:52:29,460
** I love you, baby **

691
00:52:33,500 --> 00:52:35,980
** Well, I do
and I do and I do **

692
00:52:36,500 --> 00:52:38,700
** And I don't mean, baby **

693
00:52:39,500 --> 00:52:41,980
** I've got
some lovesick blues **

694
00:52:43,500 --> 00:52:46,420
** I got this loneliness
that I can't lose **

695
00:52:48,500 --> 00:52:50,700
** I can't sleep at night **

696
00:52:52,500 --> 00:52:55,220
** I miss you, baby,
with all my mind **

697
00:52:57,500 --> 00:52:59,620
** I try to pass you by **

698
00:53:01,500 --> 00:53:03,820
** But when I look at you... **

699
00:53:14,500 --> 00:53:16,300
( Raphael cheers )

700
00:53:16,500 --> 00:53:18,660
Raphael:
Come on! Come on!

701
00:53:19,500 --> 00:53:20,900
Come on!

702
00:53:23,500 --> 00:53:25,220
Come on, Big Al.

703
00:53:25,500 --> 00:53:27,260
Come on, jump on!

704
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:33,180
Carnival rides.

705
00:53:33,500 --> 00:53:35,620
I can't compete with that.

706
00:53:36,500 --> 00:53:38,820
This isn't me.
This is stupid!

707
00:53:39,500 --> 00:53:41,580
See, this is what happens

708
00:53:42,500 --> 00:53:43,500
when you go against
everything you know

709
00:53:43,500 --> 00:53:46,180
and you give in
to your petty thoughts.

710
00:53:46,500 --> 00:53:48,980
You guys must be
pretty disgusted.

711
00:53:49,500 --> 00:53:51,940
Beat them
at their own game, pff!

712
00:53:52,500 --> 00:53:55,940
- Raphael: Come on, baby. Give me that.
- ( Sarah laughs )

713
00:53:56,500 --> 00:53:58,260
Raphael: Come on!

714
00:53:58,500 --> 00:54:00,780
Beat them with your strengths!

715
00:54:01,500 --> 00:54:03,340
That's what you do!

716
00:54:03,500 --> 00:54:05,860
Okay, I may not be Mr. Cool guy,

717
00:54:07,500 --> 00:54:10,500
but I'm pretty smart, and
that guy's practically a moron.

718
00:54:10,500 --> 00:54:12,500
Sarah's got to see that.

719
00:54:12,500 --> 00:54:16,060
So out of everybody, she brushed me
with the ostrich feather,

720
00:54:16,500 --> 00:54:19,100
and she's like the God
of the Ashram.

721
00:54:19,500 --> 00:54:23,260
Everyone there said there were
divine reasons for the whole thing.

722
00:54:23,500 --> 00:54:26,540
I tried to get her out
for a beer to discuss it,

723
00:54:27,500 --> 00:54:29,420
but they don't drink.

724
00:54:29,500 --> 00:54:32,340
So I sat down and
I wrote a haiku about it.

725
00:54:34,500 --> 00:54:36,820
That's a special Japanese poem.

726
00:54:37,500 --> 00:54:39,500
It almost won an award.

727
00:54:39,500 --> 00:54:41,820
- You want to hear it?
- Sure.

728
00:54:42,500 --> 00:54:43,980
All right.

729
00:54:44,500 --> 00:54:46,620
"One lone man got brushed

730
00:54:48,500 --> 00:54:50,740
Then in a bar, he got flushed

731
00:54:52,500 --> 00:54:54,380
Had to call a cab."

732
00:54:54,500 --> 00:54:56,260
See, it's tricky.

733
00:54:56,500 --> 00:54:58,500
You can only use 1 7 syllables.

734
00:54:58,500 --> 00:55:00,260
Five, then seven,

735
00:55:00,500 --> 00:55:02,340
then five, exactly.

736
00:55:02,500 --> 00:55:04,500
It took me a couple of hours
to shave it down.

737
00:55:04,500 --> 00:55:06,380
Wow, that is tricky.

738
00:55:06,500 --> 00:55:07,780
So...

739
00:55:08,500 --> 00:55:10,420
another one might be:

740
00:55:10,500 --> 00:55:12,500
"He went for knowledge

741
00:55:14,500 --> 00:55:16,780
Instead, he got good and drunk

742
00:55:19,500 --> 00:55:21,380
Is nothing sacred?"

743
00:55:25,500 --> 00:55:26,780
Yeah.

744
00:55:27,500 --> 00:55:29,500
I guess that works out
to 1 7 syllables.

745
00:55:29,500 --> 00:55:32,300
That's fun. Hey, wait.
How about this one:

746
00:55:32,500 --> 00:55:34,540
"They heard his stories

747
00:55:36,500 --> 00:55:38,780
He swore they were true always

748
00:55:41,500 --> 00:55:43,580
Still, one never knows."

749
00:55:45,500 --> 00:55:47,140
Raphael: Yeah.

750
00:55:48,500 --> 00:55:49,500
Wait, wait, wait.

751
00:55:49,500 --> 00:55:51,460
"The man stumbled off

752
00:55:52,500 --> 00:55:54,580
It happens to sore losers

753
00:55:55,500 --> 00:55:57,500
They can't take the heat."

754
00:55:57,500 --> 00:55:58,980
1 7 again!

755
00:55:59,500 --> 00:56:00,780
What?

756
00:56:03,500 --> 00:56:05,700
You think this impresses me?

757
00:56:06,500 --> 00:56:09,500
- Humiliating him like that?
- Just making up poems.

758
00:56:09,500 --> 00:56:11,940
It's cruel.
And it's beneath you.

759
00:56:16,500 --> 00:56:18,980
Alan: Well,
that really backfired.

760
00:56:19,500 --> 00:56:21,500
** If I lose my mind **

761
00:56:25,500 --> 00:56:28,420
** You'll be the first one
I would find... **

762
00:56:31,500 --> 00:56:34,900
The following weeks became
a somewhat dark period for me.

763
00:56:35,500 --> 00:56:38,140
** ...The last thing
I would see... **

764
00:56:41,500 --> 00:56:45,100
I guess you just have to accept
when things don't go your way.

765
00:56:50,500 --> 00:56:52,620
** ...If I lose my head **

766
00:56:56,500 --> 00:56:59,420
** You'll be the first one
out of there... **

767
00:57:05,500 --> 00:57:08,300
Plus, I realized
they were great together.

768
00:57:13,500 --> 00:57:16,780
But then, after many,
many nights alone in my trailer,

769
00:57:18,500 --> 00:57:21,500
I realized something else.
There's no other women!

770
00:57:21,500 --> 00:57:23,900
And besides,
she liked me first,

771
00:57:25,500 --> 00:57:27,500
and he's just a reckless fool.

772
00:57:27,500 --> 00:57:29,980
Things just need
to be made clear.

773
00:57:30,500 --> 00:57:32,420
The Chetabi also say,

774
00:57:32,500 --> 00:57:35,940
"With a helping hand, the snake
will bite its own tail."

775
00:57:37,500 --> 00:57:39,340
All I have to do...

776
00:57:39,500 --> 00:57:40,900
is wait.

777
00:57:58,500 --> 00:58:00,180
Would you stop?

778
00:58:05,500 --> 00:58:07,500
Did you take something?

779
00:58:07,500 --> 00:58:09,580
Just a little wake-me-up.

780
00:58:24,500 --> 00:58:26,100
Good morning.

781
00:58:26,500 --> 00:58:28,500
- Hey.
- Good morning.

782
00:58:32,500 --> 00:58:33,820
Mmm...

783
00:58:35,500 --> 00:58:37,220
Is that chicory?

784
00:58:37,500 --> 00:58:38,700
No.

785
00:58:42,500 --> 00:58:43,500
Listen.

786
00:58:43,500 --> 00:58:46,820
I just want to let bygones be bygones.
What do you say?

787
00:58:49,500 --> 00:58:51,500
- Of course, Alan.
- Sure.

788
00:58:51,500 --> 00:58:52,820
Great.

789
00:59:01,500 --> 00:59:02,900
Woo-hoo!

790
00:59:07,500 --> 00:59:10,540
- Come on, guys. Get in.
- It's too cold for me.

791
00:59:11,500 --> 00:59:13,220
Come on, get in.

792
00:59:19,500 --> 00:59:21,180
Raphael: Hey...

793
00:59:23,500 --> 00:59:25,740
I want to play a little joke.

794
00:59:32,500 --> 00:59:35,140
Let see how long
I can hold my breath.

795
00:59:35,500 --> 00:59:37,500
Come on. Don't mess around.
It's not funny.

796
00:59:37,500 --> 00:59:39,780
- I'll time you.
- You're on.

797
00:59:40,500 --> 00:59:42,260
All right. One...

798
00:59:43,500 --> 00:59:45,100
two... three.

799
00:59:58,500 --> 01:00:00,180
Where is he at?

800
01:00:06,500 --> 01:00:09,020
Come on, you won.
You're the champ.

801
01:00:13,500 --> 01:00:16,100
Raphael, come on.
Alan, look for him.

802
01:00:23,500 --> 01:00:25,500
Sarah: My God! Alan,
help him! Help him!

803
01:00:25,500 --> 01:00:28,500
Alan: I can't see where he went.
It's too dark.

804
01:00:28,500 --> 01:00:29,900
Raphael!

805
01:00:30,500 --> 01:00:33,300
- Alan, find him!
- Alan: I can't see him!

806
01:00:37,500 --> 01:00:39,700
- Gotcha!
- Son of a bitch!

807
01:00:41,500 --> 01:00:42,500
Fucking moron!

808
01:00:42,500 --> 01:00:44,420
Sorry. It was a joke.

809
01:00:45,500 --> 01:00:47,500
I'm not a goddamn moron!

810
01:00:47,500 --> 01:00:49,420
Alan: Come on, Sarah.

811
01:01:00,500 --> 01:01:01,900
Come on.

812
01:01:17,500 --> 01:01:20,660
That's part of his charm.
He doesn't mean any harm.

813
01:01:21,500 --> 01:01:23,500
I know, but it can cause harm.

814
01:01:23,500 --> 01:01:26,500
You can't be unreliable
in these circumstances.

815
01:01:29,500 --> 01:01:32,460
Look, we can catch any mistakes
that he makes.

816
01:01:32,500 --> 01:01:35,820
Come on, it's not like
he's a drug addict or something.

817
01:01:39,500 --> 01:01:42,340
Yeah. Anyway, tell him
I expect an apology.

818
01:01:43,500 --> 01:01:44,980
Of course.

819
01:01:52,500 --> 01:01:55,500
It's no biggie. She said
she's a little overtired

820
01:01:55,500 --> 01:01:58,060
and it's probably best
to let it go.

821
01:01:58,500 --> 01:02:00,500
- You think?
- Yeah, man.

822
01:02:00,500 --> 01:02:03,420
Just be yourself.
That'll snap her out of it.

823
01:02:03,500 --> 01:02:05,300
Good advice. Okay.

824
01:02:11,500 --> 01:02:13,180
Raphael: Hey...

825
01:02:13,500 --> 01:02:16,420
you think I can go off the chair
and make it?

826
01:02:18,500 --> 01:02:19,980
Go for it.

827
01:02:29,500 --> 01:02:31,220
Do your gripper.

828
01:02:38,500 --> 01:02:39,860
Dinner.

829
01:02:47,500 --> 01:02:50,540
Woo! 44 to zip, and still
champion of the world:

830
01:02:51,500 --> 01:02:52,900
Raphael!

831
01:02:55,500 --> 01:02:57,300
Let's mix this up.

832
01:02:57,500 --> 01:02:58,500
( cars honking )

833
01:02:58,500 --> 01:03:00,540
Candied yams. All right!

834
01:03:06,500 --> 01:03:09,900
So I was thinking about putting
a whole dirt bike course.

835
01:03:11,500 --> 01:03:13,500
It'd be cool,
with jumps and everything.

836
01:03:13,500 --> 01:03:16,460
- What do you think, Al?
- I love dirt racing.

837
01:03:20,500 --> 01:03:21,820
Relax.

838
01:03:22,500 --> 01:03:25,500
It's not fun to be
the last people on Earth lately.

839
01:03:25,500 --> 01:03:27,700
It's not supposed to be fun.

840
01:03:28,500 --> 01:03:31,500
- What does that mean?
- We have responsibilities.

841
01:03:31,500 --> 01:03:34,780
We should contribute something.
Alan has his research,

842
01:03:35,500 --> 01:03:39,060
and I want to do something
instead of sitting around all day.

843
01:03:39,500 --> 01:03:41,500
What do you want to do?

844
01:03:43,500 --> 01:03:46,300
Well... I was thinking
about a memorial...

845
01:03:47,500 --> 01:03:51,300
to good people who never got noticed
'cause everybody died so fast.

846
01:03:52,500 --> 01:03:55,380
I had this idea how to do it.
With balloons,

847
01:03:55,500 --> 01:03:59,060
each one carrying a little pouch
with somebody's story in it.

848
01:03:59,500 --> 01:04:03,340
And they could just scatter everywhere
for somebody to find someday.

849
01:04:03,500 --> 01:04:06,180
- You could help me write them.
- Okay.

850
01:04:08,500 --> 01:04:10,300
Yeah, that's cool.

851
01:04:10,500 --> 01:04:13,500
I could even put them in a net
that would release with a charge.

852
01:04:13,500 --> 01:04:17,180
We could have a launch ceremony
right in the middle of the camp.

853
01:04:18,500 --> 01:04:19,780
Okay.

854
01:04:21,500 --> 01:04:24,140
But we'll release them
from the ridge.

855
01:04:26,500 --> 01:04:28,500
Gee, it's kind of high.

856
01:04:28,500 --> 01:04:30,260
I said the ridge!

857
01:04:34,500 --> 01:04:36,340
It'll be beautiful.

858
01:05:44,500 --> 01:05:46,340
Okay, we're secure.

859
01:05:46,500 --> 01:05:48,820
I've just got
to pack the cap.

860
01:05:49,500 --> 01:05:51,340
I checked my notes.

861
01:05:51,500 --> 01:05:53,940
I think I worked out
to 54 grams.

862
01:05:58,500 --> 01:06:00,500
Yeah, that's what it says.

863
01:06:00,500 --> 01:06:02,220
Raphael: Okay...

864
01:06:02,500 --> 01:06:03,980
Done deal.

865
01:06:04,500 --> 01:06:07,220
- Sarah: Are we all set?
- Raphael: Yep.

866
01:06:13,500 --> 01:06:14,820
Hello.

867
01:06:15,500 --> 01:06:17,500
Today is a very special day,

868
01:06:17,500 --> 01:06:20,500
because we are honoring those
who contributed to our world,

869
01:06:20,500 --> 01:06:22,460
but went unrecognized.

870
01:06:23,500 --> 01:06:26,020
I'm speaking
of those people I knew

871
01:06:26,500 --> 01:06:30,300
who contributed to our world
and made things better in a small way.

872
01:06:44,500 --> 01:06:48,300
and many others whose stories
will now be carried to the far winds.

873
01:06:53,500 --> 01:06:55,140
Remember them.

874
01:07:02,500 --> 01:07:03,700
No!

875
01:07:15,500 --> 01:07:17,660
I just don't understand it.

876
01:07:21,500 --> 01:07:22,500
It still looked
kind of cool, though.

877
01:07:22,500 --> 01:07:23,780
Yeah.

878
01:07:26,500 --> 01:07:29,420
( Sarah and Raphael
arguing in the distance )

879
01:07:32,500 --> 01:07:33,500
Things...

880
01:07:33,500 --> 01:07:35,420
seem to have changed.

881
01:07:35,500 --> 01:07:37,740
I knew they would eventually.

882
01:07:38,500 --> 01:07:40,500
Sarah needed
to wake up a little bit.

883
01:07:40,500 --> 01:07:43,220
The female brush boar
circles the males,

884
01:07:44,500 --> 01:07:45,500
until she finds her mate,

885
01:07:45,500 --> 01:07:47,500
and then she never leaves.

886
01:07:47,500 --> 01:07:49,300
It was inevitable.

887
01:07:50,500 --> 01:07:52,820
- ( knocking )
- It's Raphael.

888
01:07:56,500 --> 01:07:58,140
Can I come in?

889
01:07:58,500 --> 01:08:01,340
- Yeah, sure.
- Am I interrupting anything?

890
01:08:02,500 --> 01:08:04,940
No, just making
some crank calls.

891
01:08:05,500 --> 01:08:06,780
What?

892
01:08:07,500 --> 01:08:09,220
You old dog you!

893
01:08:11,500 --> 01:08:13,540
I wanted to talk to you.

894
01:08:14,500 --> 01:08:17,060
- Is that thing on?
- No. What's up?

895
01:08:18,500 --> 01:08:20,100
I don't know.

896
01:08:21,500 --> 01:08:23,500
Something's weird with Sarah.

897
01:08:23,500 --> 01:08:26,500
- How do you mean?
- She's pissed about the balloon fiasco,

898
01:08:26,500 --> 01:08:29,060
and 'cause of the day
at the stream.

899
01:08:29,500 --> 01:08:31,500
But it's more than that.

900
01:08:31,500 --> 01:08:33,380
It's her attitude...

901
01:08:34,500 --> 01:08:35,500
Alan!

902
01:08:35,500 --> 01:08:37,500
Wake up!
Wake up, God damn it!

903
01:08:37,500 --> 01:08:39,780
- What? I'm awake.
- Raphael.

904
01:08:40,500 --> 01:08:42,500
He was here.
He went out for a spin.

905
01:08:42,500 --> 01:08:44,500
Did you say something to him?
Did you?!

906
01:08:44,500 --> 01:08:47,500
- We talked a little. Why?
- What did you say?!

907
01:08:48,500 --> 01:08:50,460
Nothing. What's wrong?

908
01:08:50,500 --> 01:08:52,220
He's gone, Alan.

909
01:08:54,500 --> 01:08:55,980
He's gone.

910
01:08:59,500 --> 01:09:00,820
Jesus.

911
01:09:02,500 --> 01:09:04,620
I figure she talks to you.

912
01:09:06,500 --> 01:09:08,500
You might know
what's going on.

913
01:09:08,500 --> 01:09:11,860
Well, no, she doesn't really talk
to me so much anymore,

914
01:09:13,500 --> 01:09:15,420
since things changed.

915
01:09:15,500 --> 01:09:17,940
Raphael:
I guess that's my fault.

916
01:09:18,500 --> 01:09:20,780
I really am sorry
about that.

917
01:09:22,500 --> 01:09:25,140
You didn't exactly have
a fair chance.

918
01:09:25,500 --> 01:09:27,460
Alan: Well, it's okay.

919
01:09:28,500 --> 01:09:31,340
You know, I know
what you mean about Sarah.

920
01:09:31,500 --> 01:09:34,220
And you shouldn't
take it the wrong way.

921
01:09:34,500 --> 01:09:37,580
Sarah was raised
around a certain type of person,

922
01:09:38,500 --> 01:09:40,500
and it's what she's used to.

923
01:09:40,500 --> 01:09:43,620
A certain amount of education,
that sort of thing.

924
01:09:44,500 --> 01:09:47,940
You know, when she thinks
someone's a little slow for her.

925
01:09:49,500 --> 01:09:50,500
Raphael: I'm not slow.

926
01:09:50,500 --> 01:09:52,500
If that's what she thinks,

927
01:09:52,500 --> 01:09:54,380
she can kiss my ass.

928
01:09:55,500 --> 01:09:57,500
Who the fuck
does she think she is?

929
01:09:57,500 --> 01:10:00,140
I'm not some white-trash
motherfucker!

930
01:10:09,500 --> 01:10:11,420
The funny thing is...

931
01:10:13,500 --> 01:10:15,380
I actually love her.

932
01:10:17,500 --> 01:10:20,700
She's right, I'm probably
not good enough for her...

933
01:10:21,500 --> 01:10:23,620
but I really did love her.

934
01:10:32,500 --> 01:10:35,060
Alan:
Things were rough for a while.

935
01:10:35,500 --> 01:10:38,500
Raphael's disappearance
was a big blow to Sarah.

936
01:10:38,500 --> 01:10:42,180
And I've got to say, I feel
pretty crappy about the whole thing.

937
01:10:44,500 --> 01:10:47,060
But he wasn't exactly
Mother Teresa,

938
01:10:47,500 --> 01:10:50,180
and I honestly think
it's for the best.

939
01:10:50,500 --> 01:10:52,740
( melancholy ballad playing )

940
01:11:30,500 --> 01:11:32,460
- Morning.
- Morning.

941
01:11:34,500 --> 01:11:37,180
Alan: And now, well...
things are good.

942
01:11:38,500 --> 01:11:40,700
They're really, really good.

943
01:11:57,500 --> 01:11:59,700
Who's my little sleepy bear?

944
01:12:03,500 --> 01:12:05,740
Come on, it's breakfast time.

945
01:12:06,500 --> 01:12:08,900
- Here we go.
- No, that's okay.

946
01:12:11,500 --> 01:12:13,140
It's spilling.

947
01:12:15,500 --> 01:12:17,220
What time is it?

948
01:12:19,500 --> 01:12:22,340
It's like...
4:00 in the morning, isn't it?

949
01:12:23,500 --> 01:12:24,780
Yeah.

950
01:12:25,500 --> 01:12:28,340
Let's do something.
What do you want to do?

951
01:12:29,500 --> 01:12:32,660
I don't know. Maybe we could
sleep a little longer.

952
01:12:34,500 --> 01:12:36,500
Then, we could... read.

953
01:12:38,500 --> 01:12:40,180
After we sleep.

954
01:12:40,500 --> 01:12:41,500
Okay.

955
01:12:41,500 --> 01:12:43,420
You could read to me.

956
01:12:43,500 --> 01:12:45,020
Yeah. Okay.

957
01:12:46,500 --> 01:12:48,740
But I'm going to get 40 more.

958
01:12:53,500 --> 01:12:54,820
Winks.

959
01:12:55,500 --> 01:12:56,500
Hi.

960
01:12:56,500 --> 01:13:00,300
I really felt it was about time
we got back to our Chetabi lessons.

961
01:13:00,500 --> 01:13:04,060
So I thought we'd spend the afternoon
discussing rock prints.

962
01:13:04,500 --> 01:13:07,540
They were used as a record,
like cave paintings,

963
01:13:08,500 --> 01:13:11,100
but they captured
internal experience

964
01:13:11,500 --> 01:13:13,540
rather than mere events.

965
01:13:14,500 --> 01:13:17,580
The Chetabi would douse themselves
in coloring...

966
01:13:24,500 --> 01:13:27,140
then think about
their ordeal during--

967
01:13:29,500 --> 01:13:31,500
I don't know,
a big hunt or whatever--

968
01:13:31,500 --> 01:13:33,260
and make a print.

969
01:13:39,500 --> 01:13:41,020
( screams )

970
01:13:45,500 --> 01:13:47,380
Really, they were...

971
01:13:47,500 --> 01:13:50,060
a far more accurate
representation--

972
01:13:51,500 --> 01:13:53,420
- Hey, honey.
- Hey.

973
01:13:53,500 --> 01:13:55,460
You have paint on you.

974
01:13:56,500 --> 01:13:59,300
I'm kind of in the middle
of a piece here.

975
01:13:59,500 --> 01:14:02,060
Sorry. I'll just sit here
and watch.

976
01:14:03,500 --> 01:14:05,220
Okay, as I said,

977
01:14:06,500 --> 01:14:09,500
they really were
a more accurate representation

978
01:14:09,500 --> 01:14:13,100
than, say, some stick figure
of a buffalo falling in a hole...

979
01:14:14,500 --> 01:14:17,420
because they captured
the brutal essence of--

980
01:14:17,500 --> 01:14:18,980
no, honey.

981
01:14:19,500 --> 01:14:22,100
No. You're messing up
the rock print.

982
01:14:22,500 --> 01:14:25,180
- Oh, sorry.
- It's serious stuff here,

983
01:14:25,500 --> 01:14:27,500
and I kind of need to concentrate
to get through it.

984
01:14:27,500 --> 01:14:30,580
I'll be real quiet.
You won't even know I'm here.

985
01:14:32,500 --> 01:14:33,780
Okay.

986
01:14:35,500 --> 01:14:37,420
Now, as I was saying,

987
01:14:37,500 --> 01:14:40,060
one can sense
the true brutal nature

988
01:14:41,500 --> 01:14:43,740
of the animal running down...

989
01:14:44,500 --> 01:14:46,460
the--
the thing is...

990
01:14:47,500 --> 01:14:50,500
I can't concentrate
while you're sitting there...

991
01:14:50,500 --> 01:14:52,100
is the thing.

992
01:14:53,500 --> 01:14:54,780
Okay.

993
01:14:55,500 --> 01:14:56,780
Fine!

994
01:15:01,500 --> 01:15:03,140
What was that?

995
01:15:05,500 --> 01:15:08,340
It's kind of odd behavior,
don't you think?

996
01:15:10,500 --> 01:15:11,740
Odd.

997
01:15:25,500 --> 01:15:27,260
Eat your carrots.

998
01:15:27,500 --> 01:15:29,500
No, honey,
I don't like them.

999
01:15:29,500 --> 01:15:32,140
- They're good for your eyes.
- Sarah.

1000
01:15:34,500 --> 01:15:36,500
- Sarah: Here comes the airplane.
- I don't like car--

1001
01:15:36,500 --> 01:15:38,900
Sarah:
Open up. I said, open up!

1002
01:15:39,500 --> 01:15:42,580
What are you doing?
I said, I don't like carrots!

1003
01:15:45,500 --> 01:15:47,460
Come on, what's wrong?

1004
01:15:49,500 --> 01:15:52,180
- You're going to leave.
- No, I'm not.

1005
01:15:52,500 --> 01:15:55,260
Yes, you are!
You'll leave me here alone!

1006
01:15:56,500 --> 01:15:58,140
I won't leave.

1007
01:15:59,500 --> 01:16:01,620
I just don't like carrots.

1008
01:16:06,500 --> 01:16:08,420
I'll never leave you.

1009
01:16:19,500 --> 01:16:22,020
Alan:
Things have been interesting.

1010
01:16:24,500 --> 01:16:27,860
Sarah and I have been spending
all of our time together.

1011
01:16:28,500 --> 01:16:30,420
A great deal of time.

1012
01:16:36,500 --> 01:16:39,220
And I guess
I've had some time to think.

1013
01:16:46,500 --> 01:16:48,500
Sarah, screaming: Alan!

1014
01:16:50,500 --> 01:16:53,340
I said maxi pads!
These things are useless!

1015
01:16:54,500 --> 01:16:57,060
But I got two cases
of these things.

1016
01:16:57,500 --> 01:17:00,780
Alan: And really, things
aren't working out perfectly.

1017
01:17:02,500 --> 01:17:05,020
Sarah's fine,
but she clings to me.

1018
01:17:05,500 --> 01:17:08,500
Like I'm going to disappear
if I go to the bathroom.

1019
01:17:08,500 --> 01:17:09,820
Jesus.

1020
01:17:10,500 --> 01:17:12,740
I live by certain principles,

1021
01:17:13,500 --> 01:17:16,500
and the Chetabi understood
that when you're too attached,

1022
01:17:16,500 --> 01:17:18,660
it puts pressure on things.

1023
01:17:20,500 --> 01:17:22,660
I need some breathing room.

1024
01:17:23,500 --> 01:17:26,460
Just for a little while.
It'll be good for us.

1025
01:17:27,500 --> 01:17:29,500
I've got to talk to her.

1026
01:17:29,500 --> 01:17:32,420
That little laugh of hers
is driving me nuts.

1027
01:17:35,500 --> 01:17:37,300
Now, birthday boy,

1028
01:17:37,500 --> 01:17:39,500
you just sit right there.

1029
01:17:39,500 --> 01:17:41,500
It's time for your big surprise.

1030
01:17:41,500 --> 01:17:44,420
Come on, I don't like
making such a big deal.

1031
01:17:46,500 --> 01:17:49,700
- The Chetabi didn't do birthdays.
- Never you mind.

1032
01:17:50,500 --> 01:17:52,660
** Happy birthday to you **

1033
01:17:55,500 --> 01:17:57,660
** Happy birthday to you **

1034
01:18:00,500 --> 01:18:02,820
** Happy birthday, dear Alan **

1035
01:18:05,500 --> 01:18:07,700
** Happy birthday to you. **

1036
01:18:08,500 --> 01:18:10,660
Now, blow out your candles.

1037
01:18:11,500 --> 01:18:13,060
Yeah! Now...

1038
01:18:13,500 --> 01:18:15,260
it is time for...

1039
01:18:15,500 --> 01:18:17,300
your big surprise.

1040
01:18:17,500 --> 01:18:20,500
- Can you guess what it is?
- I'm not good at that.

1041
01:18:20,500 --> 01:18:22,820
- Come on, guess.
- A new car.

1042
01:18:23,500 --> 01:18:26,500
- No. Guess again.
- A lifetime supply of everything.

1043
01:18:26,500 --> 01:18:29,060
Alan, come on.
It's really exciting.

1044
01:18:29,500 --> 01:18:31,980
I don't know.
Is it something new?

1045
01:18:32,500 --> 01:18:35,500
It's brand new, but it's been
going on since ancient times.

1046
01:18:35,500 --> 01:18:36,500
A Bible?

1047
01:18:36,500 --> 01:18:37,500
A watch?

1048
01:18:37,500 --> 01:18:39,940
- They had those back then.
- No.

1049
01:18:40,500 --> 01:18:41,500
No?

1050
01:18:41,500 --> 01:18:43,260
It's brand new...

1051
01:18:43,500 --> 01:18:45,780
but it's been going on since--

1052
01:18:50,500 --> 01:18:52,260
Are you pregnant?

1053
01:18:53,500 --> 01:18:55,060
- No.
- Oh.

1054
01:18:55,500 --> 01:18:58,260
It's a copy of
your goddamn dissertation.

1055
01:18:58,500 --> 01:19:01,460
I gathered it up and
sewed the binding myself.

1056
01:19:01,500 --> 01:19:04,500
- It's a great gift.
- Why did you ask if I was pregnant?

1057
01:19:04,500 --> 01:19:06,500
I didn't mean it
to sound that way.

1058
01:19:06,500 --> 01:19:08,500
How did you mean it
to sound?

1059
01:19:08,500 --> 01:19:10,940
You said it
the way you meant it.

1060
01:19:12,500 --> 01:19:15,140
There was a time
when you'd joke about

1061
01:19:15,500 --> 01:19:18,940
how we had to sleep together all day
to fill up the Earth.

1062
01:19:19,500 --> 01:19:22,500
- And now, you're going to leave me.
- I'm not!

1063
01:19:22,500 --> 01:19:25,300
Why do you keep saying that?
Jesus, Sarah!

1064
01:19:26,500 --> 01:19:29,140
I don't know.
I just feel that lately,

1065
01:19:29,500 --> 01:19:31,500
we've been
on top of each other.

1066
01:19:31,500 --> 01:19:33,980
I just need
some breathing room...

1067
01:19:34,500 --> 01:19:36,500
to step back and think.

1068
01:19:39,500 --> 01:19:42,020
- What's to think about?
- Nothing.

1069
01:19:43,500 --> 01:19:46,260
I think we should
change things a little.

1070
01:19:47,500 --> 01:19:50,060
Be more like friends...
for a while.

1071
01:19:59,500 --> 01:20:01,500
I didn't have
to put on this dress,

1072
01:20:01,500 --> 01:20:03,500
or these miserable high heels,

1073
01:20:03,500 --> 01:20:05,820
or give you this fucking party.

1074
01:20:06,500 --> 01:20:09,500
'Cause you know what? I'm the last
fucking woman on this Earth!

1075
01:20:09,500 --> 01:20:11,500
I could sit around
eating bon-bons all day,

1076
01:20:11,500 --> 01:20:14,260
wearing a house coat
and gain 300 pounds.

1077
01:20:14,500 --> 01:20:17,500
And you know what?
You'd stilI have to fuck me.

1078
01:20:17,500 --> 01:20:19,420
But I was being nice.

1079
01:20:32,500 --> 01:20:34,500
It's going to work out.

1080
01:20:36,500 --> 01:20:38,500
We just need some time.

1081
01:20:39,500 --> 01:20:41,300
( engine roaring )

1082
01:20:54,500 --> 01:20:56,100
Where is she?

1083
01:20:56,500 --> 01:20:59,940
Where the hell were you?!
Off raiding some pharmacy chain?

1084
01:21:01,500 --> 01:21:04,860
- Where is she, Alan?
- She doesn't want to talk to you.

1085
01:21:05,500 --> 01:21:06,820
Sarah?

1086
01:21:07,500 --> 01:21:10,020
- Sarah?
- No, don't listen to him!

1087
01:21:11,500 --> 01:21:13,740
- Sarah!
- Sarah! I'm sorry!

1088
01:21:15,500 --> 01:21:17,500
What I said--
I was confused.

1089
01:21:17,500 --> 01:21:19,700
- I'm sorry.
- I had to go.

1090
01:21:20,500 --> 01:21:22,260
I thought that...

1091
01:21:22,500 --> 01:21:24,900
you didn't want me here
anymore.

1092
01:21:26,500 --> 01:21:28,460
But then, I found one.

1093
01:22:36,500 --> 01:22:39,500
I guess you've learned
the same lessons I have.

1094
01:22:39,500 --> 01:22:42,820
I started this tape to teach you
about decent behavior,

1095
01:22:43,500 --> 01:22:46,300
but the truth is,
I was happier back then.

1096
01:22:46,500 --> 01:22:48,460
You saw what happened.

1097
01:22:48,500 --> 01:22:51,620
These people moved in,
and they ruined everything!

1098
01:22:52,500 --> 01:22:54,500
They screwed around with my emotions,
like I was nothing.

1099
01:22:54,500 --> 01:22:57,180
You can't manipulate
someone like that.

1100
01:22:57,500 --> 01:23:00,500
And if that's what it's going
to be like living together,

1101
01:23:00,500 --> 01:23:02,460
I'll just go it alone.

1102
01:23:02,500 --> 01:23:05,660
They can move out and
build their own fucking camp,

1103
01:23:06,500 --> 01:23:10,100
or I'll break his goddamn neck--
I don't care how tough he is.

1104
01:23:11,500 --> 01:23:12,500
New rule:

1105
01:23:12,500 --> 01:23:14,380
be true to yourself.

1106
01:23:19,500 --> 01:23:22,100
Get out of there,
you son of a bitch!

1107
01:23:22,500 --> 01:23:25,380
This is my trailer.
I want you out of there.

1108
01:23:26,500 --> 01:23:29,540
I want both of you out of here.
This is my camp.

1109
01:23:30,500 --> 01:23:33,940
You can go build your own,
or go live in the fucking city.

1110
01:23:34,500 --> 01:23:36,420
- Piss off.
- What?!

1111
01:23:36,500 --> 01:23:39,500
Where do you get the audacity
to talk to me like that?

1112
01:23:39,500 --> 01:23:42,420
You come in here and
you fuck everything up--

1113
01:23:42,500 --> 01:23:45,100
Let me tell you something,
just once.

1114
01:23:45,500 --> 01:23:47,500
You're going to get out.
Get into your car

1115
01:23:47,500 --> 01:23:49,620
and drive away real quick.

1116
01:23:50,500 --> 01:23:53,500
Or I'll kick your ass
right back down to the highway.

1117
01:23:53,500 --> 01:23:56,300
Sarah: Forget it.
Just let it go, Raphael.

1118
01:23:59,500 --> 01:24:01,020
Sure! Sure!

1119
01:24:01,500 --> 01:24:04,780
Why don't all the beautiful people
just stick together

1120
01:24:05,500 --> 01:24:09,060
and fuck over everybody else?!
So you can stare at yourselves

1121
01:24:09,500 --> 01:24:13,020
and get off on how much better
you are than everybody else!?

1122
01:24:14,500 --> 01:24:16,780
It's over.
We know about you.

1123
01:24:17,500 --> 01:24:19,380
We watched the tape.

1124
01:24:20,500 --> 01:24:22,500
You're a sick motherfucker,

1125
01:24:22,500 --> 01:24:25,340
spying on us and twisting
everything around

1126
01:24:25,500 --> 01:24:28,060
in your little Chetabi
fantasy land.

1127
01:24:28,500 --> 01:24:31,500
Do you really think
that makes you better than us?

1128
01:24:31,500 --> 01:24:33,380
You're such a loser.

1129
01:24:34,500 --> 01:24:36,820
Now, get
the hell out of here.

1130
01:24:47,500 --> 01:24:49,140
Goodbye, Alan.

1131
01:24:55,500 --> 01:24:59,300
The Chetabi have a word for members
of the tribe who don't belong--

1132
01:24:59,500 --> 01:25:00,860
Kirosu.

1133
01:25:01,500 --> 01:25:04,460
These are people
who take advantage of others,

1134
01:25:04,500 --> 01:25:06,620
who don't mend their ways.

1135
01:25:07,500 --> 01:25:09,300
So, one morning...

1136
01:25:09,500 --> 01:25:11,300
they're just gone.

1137
01:25:11,500 --> 01:25:13,500
No one ever asks
any questions.

1138
01:25:13,500 --> 01:25:15,660
It's really very civilized.

1139
01:25:19,500 --> 01:25:21,060
I was wrong.

1140
01:25:21,500 --> 01:25:24,180
Violence isn't caused
by hate and envy.

1141
01:25:24,500 --> 01:25:27,140
It's caused
by these kinds of people--

1142
01:25:27,500 --> 01:25:30,780
people who aren't decent,
who corrupt innocent people.

1143
01:25:31,500 --> 01:25:35,420
The Chetabi say you have to cut away
the bad leaves to save the plant,

1144
01:25:35,500 --> 01:25:38,980
and I can't let these kinds
of people ruin the world again.

1145
01:25:44,500 --> 01:25:46,500
This isn't what I wanted,

1146
01:25:46,500 --> 01:25:48,580
but there's no other way.

1147
01:25:55,500 --> 01:25:58,060
** I'll save
who walks this Earth **

1148
01:25:58,500 --> 01:26:00,820
** To give to you from birth **

1149
01:26:01,500 --> 01:26:04,580
** All the love our Father
felt for us on high **

1150
01:26:06,500 --> 01:26:09,060
** Now you dare
to speak His name **

1151
01:26:09,500 --> 01:26:11,980
** In tongues of fire
and shame **

1152
01:26:13,500 --> 01:26:16,580
** Repent, my friend,
or you will burn in hell **

1153
01:26:18,500 --> 01:26:21,940
** Your life is but the thing
which loving Jesus brings **

1154
01:26:24,500 --> 01:26:27,460
** And there will not be
a time after today **

1155
01:26:29,500 --> 01:26:31,500
** Come over here and bow **

1156
01:26:31,500 --> 01:26:34,060
** Get on your knees,
bow down... **

1157
01:26:34,500 --> 01:26:36,900
I'm sorry
it had to be this way.

1158
01:26:56,500 --> 01:26:57,780
Shit!

1159
01:27:07,500 --> 01:27:08,940
Let's go.

1160
01:27:10,500 --> 01:27:13,740
** ...Without Jesus,
they will surely burn in hell **

1161
01:27:15,500 --> 01:27:18,940
** Your life is but the thing
which loving Jesus brings **

1162
01:27:20,500 --> 01:27:23,580
** And there will not be
a time after today... **

1163
01:27:26,500 --> 01:27:29,300
Okay, I was a little hot
under the collar.

1164
01:27:30,500 --> 01:27:32,220
I'm not perfect.

1165
01:27:33,500 --> 01:27:35,500
So, I didn't kill them.

1166
01:27:35,500 --> 01:27:37,700
But I scared them like hell.

1167
01:27:39,500 --> 01:27:42,180
The Chetabi say
that a man is not a man

1168
01:27:42,500 --> 01:27:45,740
until he faces his own--
no, himself, his own face...

1169
01:27:48,500 --> 01:27:50,380
something like that.

1170
01:27:52,500 --> 01:27:53,860
Well...

1171
01:27:54,500 --> 01:27:56,500
that's all I have to offer.

1172
01:27:56,500 --> 01:27:59,260
I'm leaving this tape
at the supermarket,

1173
01:27:59,500 --> 01:28:02,900
next to the peanut butter
with the jelly already in it...

1174
01:28:03,500 --> 01:28:06,180
because everyone
is curious about that.

1175
01:28:07,500 --> 01:28:10,820
You'll wander over here eventually,
and you'll find it.

1176
01:28:11,500 --> 01:28:12,980
As for me,

1177
01:28:13,500 --> 01:28:14,500
I'm heading south.

1178
01:28:14,500 --> 01:28:18,060
The Chetabi are known to eat
a lot of leafy green vegetables,

1179
01:28:18,500 --> 01:28:21,020
and that stuff
is loaded with zinc.

1180
01:28:21,500 --> 01:28:23,500
So, maybe if they survived,

1181
01:28:23,500 --> 01:28:26,740
they'll let me hang around
and shoot the bull awhile.

1182
01:28:29,500 --> 01:28:33,020
I was trying to think of
a helpful way to finish this thing.

1183
01:28:34,500 --> 01:28:36,580
And I guess I realized...

1184
01:28:38,500 --> 01:28:40,500
life's a bitch, you know?

1185
01:28:40,500 --> 01:28:43,300
You've just got to try
to set some limits.

1186
01:28:44,500 --> 01:28:45,780
So...

1187
01:28:47,500 --> 01:28:49,540
be decent to each other.

1188
01:28:52,500 --> 01:28:54,580
That's the final thought.

1189
01:28:56,500 --> 01:28:57,500
And...

1190
01:28:57,500 --> 01:29:00,060
try to respect
each other's privacy.

1191
01:29:00,500 --> 01:29:02,500
That's something new
that we could add.

1192
01:29:02,500 --> 01:29:05,300
So those two things,
limits and privacy...

1193
01:29:07,500 --> 01:29:09,180
and... goodbye.

1194
01:29:18,500 --> 01:29:21,460
Aw, who am I kidding?
What the fuck do I know?

1195
01:29:28,500 --> 01:29:30,380
** Damn old blues **

1196
01:29:31,500 --> 01:29:33,620
** Send me out to drink **

1197
01:29:37,500 --> 01:29:39,940
** Before the evening's through **

1198
01:29:41,500 --> 01:29:43,260
** You show up **

1199
01:29:44,500 --> 01:29:46,340
** I can't think **

1200
01:29:47,500 --> 01:29:49,500
** Everywhere I turn **

1201
01:29:51,500 --> 01:29:53,540
** You come into view **

1202
01:29:56,500 --> 01:29:58,900
** This world ain't big enough **

1203
01:30:00,500 --> 01:30:02,380
** For me and you **

1204
01:30:06,500 --> 01:30:08,740
** I'd drive 1 0,000 miles **

1205
01:30:09,500 --> 01:30:12,020
** If I thought
I could get away **

1206
01:30:16,500 --> 01:30:19,100
** But your memory
would follow me **

1207
01:30:21,500 --> 01:30:24,300
** Down every lonesome
and dark highway **

1208
01:30:26,500 --> 01:30:28,420
** Everywhere I go **

1209
01:30:30,500 --> 01:30:32,980
** The same old thing rings true **

1210
01:30:35,500 --> 01:30:37,900
** This world ain't big enough **

1211
01:30:39,500 --> 01:30:41,380
** For me and you **

1212
01:30:45,500 --> 01:30:48,100
** No, this world
ain't big enough **

1213
01:30:50,500 --> 01:30:53,140
** To disappear
when you're in love **

1214
01:30:56,500 --> 01:30:59,180
** You keep haunting
everything I do **

1215
01:31:05,500 --> 01:31:08,100
** Maybe someday,
we'll lose touch **

1216
01:31:10,500 --> 01:31:13,260
** I'll run so fast,
you can't keep up **

1217
01:31:15,500 --> 01:31:17,900
** This world ain't big enough **

1218
01:31:18,500 --> 01:31:20,380
** For me and you **

1219
01:31:23,500 --> 01:31:25,420
** Oooh yeah, yeah **

1220
01:31:44,500 --> 01:31:46,860
** Now this ain't some picnic **

1221
01:31:48,500 --> 01:31:50,620
** Near some shady tree **

1222
01:31:54,500 --> 01:31:57,060
** I can't shake
no peaches, baby **

1223
01:31:59,500 --> 01:32:02,220
** When you got
your little eye on me **

1224
01:32:03,500 --> 01:32:05,780
** Hearing everything I say **

1225
01:32:08,500 --> 01:32:10,700
** And watching what I do **

1226
01:32:13,500 --> 01:32:15,900
** This world ain't big enough **

1227
01:32:17,500 --> 01:32:19,380
** For me and you **

1228
01:32:23,500 --> 01:32:26,100
** No, this world
ain't big enough **

1229
01:32:28,500 --> 01:32:31,140
** To disappear
when you're in love **

1230
01:32:34,500 --> 01:32:37,500
** You keep haunting
every little thing I do **

1231
01:32:43,500 --> 01:32:46,100
** Maybe someday,
we'll lose touch **

1232
01:32:48,500 --> 01:32:51,500
** Yeah, I'll run so fast,
you can't keep up **

1233
01:32:53,500 --> 01:32:55,900
** This world ain't big enough **

1234
01:32:57,500 --> 01:32:59,380
** For me and you **

1235
01:33:02,500 --> 01:33:04,260
** Yeah, I cry **

1236
01:33:05,500 --> 01:33:07,620
** I'm going to survive **

1237
01:33:08,500 --> 01:33:11,500
** There just ain't no place
to run and hide **

1238
01:33:13,500 --> 01:33:15,860
** The world ain't big enough **

1239
01:33:17,500 --> 01:33:19,380
** For me and you **

1240
01:33:30,500 --> 01:33:33,540
** You know itjust ain't
big enough, darling. **
