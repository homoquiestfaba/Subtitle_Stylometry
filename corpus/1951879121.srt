1
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:22,844
Come on. Let's go.

2
00:01:24,918 --> 00:01:27,785
The " Migra"! The " Migra"!

3
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:32,517
- Are you okay, Rosario?
- Shh, shh.

4
00:01:35,962 --> 00:01:38,658
She's getting away.

5
00:01:41,067 --> 00:01:43,558
Welcome to America, Juanito.

6
00:02:03,223 --> 00:02:04,417
Are you up?

7
00:03:49,262 --> 00:03:51,355
What would I do without you?

8
00:03:56,603 --> 00:03:59,436
Carlitos' birthday

9
00:04:31,804 --> 00:04:35,296
Oranges, sweet and fresh!

10
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:39,334
We deliver fresh orange juice
straight to your door.

11
00:04:42,048 --> 00:04:44,380
- Hey, baby!
- Creep!

12
00:04:44,584 --> 00:04:47,382
Bye, gorgeous.

13
00:04:51,824 --> 00:04:53,519
- You're going to the phone?
- Sure.

14
00:04:53,593 --> 00:04:56,460
- It's Sunday.
- See you later.

15
00:04:59,732 --> 00:05:02,064
- Wanna buy?
- No, thanks.

16
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:05,070
Gum, gum for a peso!

17
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:06,503
Chewing gum...

18
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:29,492
Yeah, I saw her yesterday at home.

19
00:05:32,432 --> 00:05:34,900
Same time, of course.

20
00:05:34,967 --> 00:05:37,458
We'll take a cab.

21
00:05:38,738 --> 00:05:39,727
Sure.

22
00:05:43,042 --> 00:05:44,873
- Carlitos?
- Mommy!

23
00:05:44,944 --> 00:05:47,504
Happy birthday, sweetie!

24
00:05:47,714 --> 00:05:49,511
Maybe I should start calling you Carlos.

25
00:05:49,649 --> 00:05:51,810
Granny says I'll have a mustache soon.

26
00:05:53,052 --> 00:05:57,045
- I'm nine.
- Did you get the gift I sent you?

27
00:05:57,123 --> 00:05:59,057
I've got them on.

28
00:05:59,125 --> 00:06:01,889
- There's something else coming, okay?
- What is it?

29
00:06:03,129 --> 00:06:07,463
- You'll see, at your party.
- I'm ready to go to L.A., Mommy.

30
00:06:10,903 --> 00:06:14,304
- I know, baby.
- I speak good English now.

31
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:17,138
I'm working very hard
so you can come soon.

32
00:06:18,678 --> 00:06:20,612
You always say that.

33
00:06:22,548 --> 00:06:24,482
I know, but it won't be long now,
okay?

34
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:27,314
Not long... But when?

35
00:06:32,091 --> 00:06:36,460
I don't know, sweetheart.
It's so hard to get papers.

36
00:06:36,529 --> 00:06:38,520
And you know how
the other lawyer robbed us.

37
00:06:38,598 --> 00:06:40,759
If I can't go there,
then you come back here.

38
00:06:40,833 --> 00:06:42,767
Four years is too long.

39
00:06:50,676 --> 00:06:52,610
You need anything, sweetie?

40
00:06:53,846 --> 00:06:55,438
You.

41
00:06:58,618 --> 00:07:00,552
Tell me where you're standing.

42
00:07:03,623 --> 00:07:06,990
I'm -You know already.

43
00:07:07,059 --> 00:07:08,822
Tell me anyway.

44
00:07:11,063 --> 00:07:16,000
Okay, I'm standing at
a phone booth by the bus stop.

45
00:07:16,068 --> 00:07:18,002
Is the pizza place still there?

46
00:07:19,205 --> 00:07:22,038
Yeah. It's here.

47
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:26,807
And there's a Laundromat
where I wash my clothes every week.

48
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:28,574
They even know me by name.

49
00:07:28,648 --> 00:07:30,809
- Really?
- Can you believe it?

50
00:07:30,883 --> 00:07:33,818
- You know what else is here?
- What?

51
00:07:33,886 --> 00:07:39,483
- A store that sells party stuff.
- Where the mural is?

52
00:07:39,559 --> 00:07:43,689
Yes, there.
That's where I'll buy the stuff...

53
00:07:43,763 --> 00:07:46,698
for all the parties
I'm gonna throw for you...

54
00:07:46,766 --> 00:07:50,759
You have 20 seconds left on your call.
- Carlitos...

55
00:07:51,938 --> 00:07:54,907
I love you with all my heart.

56
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:58,102
I love you more than
all the earth and all the sea.

57
00:07:58,177 --> 00:08:01,510
And all the stars and all the sky.

58
00:08:02,448 --> 00:08:04,416
Will you call me next Sunday, Mommy?

59
00:08:05,918 --> 00:08:09,615
Of course I will, sweetie.
10:00 a. m. sharp like every Sunday, okay?

60
00:08:09,689 --> 00:08:12,749
I love you so much. Enjoy all your-

61
00:08:49,629 --> 00:08:51,654
You're so sweet.
Thanks for coming.

62
00:08:54,467 --> 00:08:57,698
Leave the girl alone "Compadre".
What a flirt.

63
00:08:57,770 --> 00:09:00,330
- Look.
- Is that it?

64
00:09:00,406 --> 00:09:01,600
- Uh-huh.
- Wow.

65
00:09:01,674 --> 00:09:04,142
Hey, Chito!
How cool is that?

66
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:08,237
- It's awesome!
- That's one big piñata.

67
00:09:08,314 --> 00:09:11,147
Yeah, my mom sent Granny
extra money to buy it for me.

68
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:13,151
You deserve it, son.

69
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:15,312
Carlitos, get my medicine please.

70
00:09:18,758 --> 00:09:22,125
Ugh. Why are they here?
Those sons of-

71
00:09:22,194 --> 00:09:24,025
- Good afternoon.
- Hello.

72
00:09:24,096 --> 00:09:26,189
- How you doin', Benita?
- Fine.

73
00:09:26,265 --> 00:09:27,789
Came by to give the boy a hug.

74
00:09:27,867 --> 00:09:30,131
- We're so fond of him.
- Is that so?

75
00:09:32,605 --> 00:09:35,438
Well, we're gonna go put
the candles on the cake.

76
00:09:35,508 --> 00:09:39,706
- Got any matches?
- By the grill, if there's any.

77
00:09:42,114 --> 00:09:44,105
Excuse us.

78
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:49,717
Don't let them get to you.
It's bad for your health.

79
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:53,717
What's up, Carlitos?

80
00:09:53,793 --> 00:09:55,727
Give me five.

81
00:09:55,795 --> 00:09:59,561
- Happy birthday, kiddo.
- Thanks.

82
00:09:59,632 --> 00:10:01,896
No, no. Hold it!

83
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:05,863
You thought about what I said?

84
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:07,906
C'mon, Carlitos!

85
00:10:09,041 --> 00:10:11,532
My granny is gonna get better.

86
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:14,239
Your granny is very sick...

87
00:10:14,313 --> 00:10:16,838
and who knows when
your mother's coming back.

88
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:19,750
Someone has to take care of you.

89
00:10:19,819 --> 00:10:21,980
My granny takes good care of me.

90
00:10:22,054 --> 00:10:24,215
Besides, what do you care?

91
00:10:26,726 --> 00:10:30,355
- Leave him alone.
- No. It's what we're here for.

92
00:10:30,429 --> 00:10:32,056
Besides, he's old enough
to know the truth.

93
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:34,326
Not now, Manuel. It's his party.

94
00:10:38,738 --> 00:10:44,108
Look, Carlitos.
Josefina and I are your aunt and uncle.

95
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:47,544
Neighbors. Not family.

96
00:10:47,613 --> 00:10:49,547
Your dad is my brother.

97
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:53,944
- I don't have a dad.
- Yes, you do! His name is Oscar.

98
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:56,648
He lives in the U.S.
in a city called Tucson.

99
00:10:56,722 --> 00:10:58,212
Go outside, son.

100
00:11:00,292 --> 00:11:02,954
Hurry, Carlitos!

101
00:11:03,029 --> 00:11:05,520
Carlitos, Carlitos!

102
00:11:05,598 --> 00:11:07,088
You're up!

103
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:09,327
Oh, so now we're family?

104
00:11:09,402 --> 00:11:12,565
If I remember, you all denied
your brother was his father.

105
00:11:12,638 --> 00:11:14,572
That was a long time ago, Benita.

106
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,767
I'm too old for this bullshit.

107
00:11:16,876 --> 00:11:19,037
I know exactly what this is about...

108
00:11:19,111 --> 00:11:21,136
and it's got nothing to do
with Carlitos.

109
00:11:22,148 --> 00:11:24,776
I guess you don't know
about the $300...

110
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:26,784
Rosario sends every month, right?

111
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:32,950
Get out!

112
00:11:33,025 --> 00:11:35,755
Hit it, hit it, hit it
Careful with your aim

113
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:39,259
- Come on!
- Manuel-

114
00:11:39,331 --> 00:11:42,892
- Because if you lose it,
you will lose your way

115
00:11:42,968 --> 00:11:46,904
Now you hit it once
now you hit it twice

116
00:11:46,972 --> 00:11:50,135
Now you hit it three times
and your time is up#

117
00:12:06,025 --> 00:12:07,959
Did you enjoy your party?

118
00:12:11,097 --> 00:12:13,031
Did you like your gifts?

119
00:12:24,443 --> 00:12:26,877
If you don't want to talk,
we won't talk.

120
00:12:29,315 --> 00:12:31,783
Why didn't you tell me about my dad?

121
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:40,556
Your mother was going to tell you
when you got a little older.

122
00:12:44,964 --> 00:12:49,025
- Is it true what Manuel said?
- What did he say?

123
00:12:51,804 --> 00:12:54,830
That Mom won't be back
any time soon.

124
00:12:58,410 --> 00:13:00,344
Is she coming back or not?

125
00:13:02,648 --> 00:13:04,343
Don't cry.

126
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:09,751
Carlitos, you are a Reyes...

127
00:13:09,822 --> 00:13:12,086
and we Reyes are strong.

128
00:13:15,494 --> 00:13:17,428
Come here.

129
00:13:18,564 --> 00:13:22,000
Promise me you won't let them
take me away from you!

130
00:13:23,002 --> 00:13:26,733
I'd kill them first!

131
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:38,908
We're back...

132
00:13:38,984 --> 00:13:41,350
with a new program
and it's a pleasure.

133
00:13:42,354 --> 00:13:46,950
Good morning!
Time to get up if this is your alarm.

134
00:13:47,026 --> 00:13:49,290
- Up, up, up!
- Are you up?

135
00:13:52,431 --> 00:13:54,399
You have to go to work, man!

136
00:13:54,466 --> 00:13:57,902
For those of us who came
to the U.S. to work! Work!

137
00:13:57,970 --> 00:14:00,461
Work to make ends meet!

138
00:14:00,539 --> 00:14:04,134
- So how did the dress turn out?
- The girl was happy.

139
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:07,338
- How much did her parents pay you?
- $53 dollars...

140
00:14:07,413 --> 00:14:09,677
With that I have about $2,000-

141
00:14:09,748 --> 00:14:11,978
2,300 more or less.

142
00:14:13,152 --> 00:14:15,882
The new lawyer said he would
take your case for $4,000, right?

143
00:14:15,955 --> 00:14:17,889
Yes.

144
00:14:18,891 --> 00:14:20,984
So you've only got about...

145
00:14:23,229 --> 00:14:25,163
48 more dresses to go.

146
00:14:26,632 --> 00:14:28,998
Yeah.

147
00:14:29,068 --> 00:14:31,969
What's the matter?
What did I say now?

148
00:14:44,083 --> 00:14:46,643
We should just get a couple
of" gringos" to marry us.

149
00:14:48,087 --> 00:14:50,021
It'd be cheaper and faster.

150
00:15:09,341 --> 00:15:11,275
Oh, God.

151
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:16,339
You'd never do it, would you?

152
00:15:18,017 --> 00:15:20,542
I've done a lot of stupid things
in my life.

153
00:15:20,619 --> 00:15:22,553
I don't want to do another one.

154
00:15:32,364 --> 00:15:35,731
More fun with Cucuy de la Mañana!

155
00:15:37,369 --> 00:15:42,170
In the news, California's Governor
Arnold Chuarche... That guy...

156
00:15:42,241 --> 00:15:44,573
decided to veto once again...

157
00:15:44,643 --> 00:15:47,737
a bill that would have allowed
more than two and a half million...

158
00:15:47,813 --> 00:15:50,304
"undocumented" to drive freely.

159
00:15:50,382 --> 00:15:56,287
The Governor of California insisted
he would not pass a law...

160
00:15:56,355 --> 00:15:59,324
that threatened public safety.

161
00:15:59,391 --> 00:16:02,849
Well, he is a threat to us!

162
00:16:02,928 --> 00:16:04,953
Isn't it true?

163
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:07,760
What's it to him?
He's an immigrant who...

164
00:16:07,833 --> 00:16:10,063
came here from farther away
than we did!

165
00:16:10,135 --> 00:16:12,535
- Which makes him a jerk!
- A turkey!

166
00:16:12,604 --> 00:16:16,438
Man, I'm telling you.

167
00:16:16,508 --> 00:16:20,035
Don't run into him.
He might run over you with his bike!

168
00:16:23,382 --> 00:16:24,371
Hi.

169
00:16:26,518 --> 00:16:28,452
We missed you yesterday.

170
00:16:32,691 --> 00:16:34,625
- You two have a nice day.
- Thanks.

171
00:16:34,693 --> 00:16:36,126
- Bye.
- Bye.

172
00:16:39,198 --> 00:16:41,496
You're such a fool.

173
00:16:42,334 --> 00:16:44,427
Don't start with that again!

174
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:48,906
What's the matter with you?
Paco is a great guy.

175
00:16:48,974 --> 00:16:51,636
He's got a good job and he likes you.
What more do you want?

176
00:16:53,712 --> 00:16:56,579
Your life doesn't have to stop
because your son isn't here.

177
00:16:56,648 --> 00:16:59,139
I mean, we're screwed,
but we're not dead!

178
00:16:59,218 --> 00:17:03,382
That's not it. Besides,
you party enough for both of us.

179
00:17:03,455 --> 00:17:07,482
Wait a second.
I'm just looking for Mr. Right.

180
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:09,254
There's nothing wrong with that!

181
00:17:09,328 --> 00:17:11,489
And so should you.
Loosen up, tight-ass!

182
00:17:27,579 --> 00:17:29,444
- How's it going?
- Good.

183
00:17:29,515 --> 00:17:31,449
Whoa! Are those new?

184
00:17:32,551 --> 00:17:34,644
Yeah, my mom sent them
for my birthday.

185
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:38,281
Man,
you're so lucky to have a mom...

186
00:17:38,357 --> 00:17:40,518
who buys you such cool stuff!

187
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:47,661
I know.
Come on, let's go.

188
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:51,066
- How did it go yesterday?
- Good, I sold lots of gum.

189
00:17:51,136 --> 00:17:54,628
- Coming to the wrestling match?
- Nah! Gotta work.

190
00:18:03,782 --> 00:18:05,716
Are all three of you crossing?

191
00:18:06,785 --> 00:18:09,083
God has set us on this path.

192
00:18:09,721 --> 00:18:13,179
- A truck is leaving at 11:00.
- Tonight?

193
00:18:15,027 --> 00:18:19,464
What's the problem?

194
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:27,304
No, no problem. It's just
we didn't think it would be so soon.

195
00:18:27,372 --> 00:18:31,672
- So, who's driving?
- What the hell do you care?

196
00:18:32,478 --> 00:18:36,847
Look, honey.
You've got two choices.

197
00:18:36,915 --> 00:18:40,351
You either get on that truck
or you swim across...

198
00:18:40,419 --> 00:18:42,649
and see if you make it.

199
00:18:42,721 --> 00:18:43,915
Good afternoon.

200
00:18:43,989 --> 00:18:45,923
Are you Carmen?

201
00:18:46,925 --> 00:18:49,587
Doña Carmen, if you don't mind.

202
00:18:51,663 --> 00:18:56,896
Um, my brother and I,
we are legal U.S. citizens...

203
00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:58,903
From the United States.

204
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:00,939
- Do you speak English?
- Yes.

205
00:19:01,006 --> 00:19:03,531
Um, can you tell her that-

206
00:19:03,609 --> 00:19:07,545
that, um, we can take babies across?

207
00:19:07,613 --> 00:19:10,707
- They wanna know-
- I understood!

208
00:19:10,782 --> 00:19:12,272
Tell them to go to hell!

209
00:19:12,351 --> 00:19:15,787
- Sorry, no business.
- No, wait. Did you tell her?

210
00:19:15,854 --> 00:19:19,119
- Did she understand?
- Did we understand?

211
00:19:19,191 --> 00:19:22,092
Damn Chicanos,
can't even speak their own language!

212
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:24,629
- What is she saying? What did she just say?
- You better leave.

213
00:19:24,696 --> 00:19:26,630
- Did she understand?
- Yes.

214
00:19:26,698 --> 00:19:28,188
Did you understand what I said?

215
00:19:28,267 --> 00:19:30,599
Martha, let's just go talk to that
coyote your friend told us about.

216
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:33,297
David, wait. Señora.

217
00:19:33,372 --> 00:19:36,637
I'm offering to help you.

218
00:19:36,708 --> 00:19:38,642
- Please, you better leave.
- Let's go.

219
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:41,543
- Let's go.
- Please.

220
00:19:41,613 --> 00:19:44,912
- Come on, Sis.
- Okay, but if she changes her mind...

221
00:19:44,983 --> 00:19:47,645
will you just call me here?

222
00:19:47,719 --> 00:19:50,415
I'm leaving my card with him.

223
00:19:50,489 --> 00:19:53,322
Just call me. Just tell her.

224
00:19:53,392 --> 00:19:55,326
- I told you.
- Well, you weren't much help.

225
00:19:55,394 --> 00:19:57,954
What do you expect me to do?

226
00:19:59,965 --> 00:20:01,956
They think they're better than us
just because...

227
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:04,298
they were born on the " other side"?

228
00:20:04,369 --> 00:20:06,997
You've used Chicanos to take
babies to their mothers.

229
00:20:07,072 --> 00:20:10,132
Yeah, ones I know, not strangers.

230
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:13,508
Besides, those are two
very green mangoes.

231
00:20:13,579 --> 00:20:15,513
And with those scared faces...

232
00:20:15,581 --> 00:20:18,982
the "Migra" will spot them
a mile away.

233
00:20:21,587 --> 00:20:22,918
So... do we have a deal?

234
00:20:23,989 --> 00:20:25,513
Okay, let's go.

235
00:20:25,591 --> 00:20:29,493
So, it'll be $2,000 to get you across...

236
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:32,029
or $2,500 if you also want
job contacts.

237
00:20:33,432 --> 00:20:35,366
All right, Carlitos...

238
00:20:36,368 --> 00:20:40,930
tell me what you want
for your birthday.

239
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:46,473
The same thing I wanted last year,
and for Children's Day...

240
00:20:46,545 --> 00:20:50,641
- Three Kings Day and Easter.
- I know where you're going with this!

241
00:20:50,716 --> 00:20:53,048
You want me to get you across.
But I won't.

242
00:20:53,118 --> 00:20:57,020
Are you crazy?
You have no idea how dangerous it is!

243
00:20:58,890 --> 00:21:02,257
- I have money.
- I don't pay you that much.

244
00:21:03,462 --> 00:21:06,727
Been saving some of the money
my mom sends every month.

245
00:21:08,634 --> 00:21:12,161
- I've got $1,200.
- How much?

246
00:21:12,237 --> 00:21:16,537
- $1,200.
- Wow, that's a lot.

247
00:21:16,608 --> 00:21:19,076
I'm supposed to be
the businesswoman here!

248
00:21:20,479 --> 00:21:23,710
- You could give me a discount.
- No, no, no.

249
00:21:24,416 --> 00:21:26,646
I promised your mother
and your grandmother...

250
00:21:26,718 --> 00:21:28,515
I would never get you across.

251
00:21:28,587 --> 00:21:32,683
If they found out you're even working
for me, they'd pull my hair out.

252
00:21:32,758 --> 00:21:34,692
You're nuts. No way.

253
00:21:48,674 --> 00:21:50,403
Granny...

254
00:21:50,475 --> 00:21:53,342
do you want tea or hot chocolate?

255
00:21:58,016 --> 00:21:59,950
Granny.

256
00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:07,420
Granny, don't pretend
you're still asleep.

257
00:22:08,627 --> 00:22:10,686
Granny.

258
00:22:10,762 --> 00:22:12,286
Granny!

259
00:22:16,635 --> 00:22:18,569
Wake up.

260
00:22:26,545 --> 00:22:30,982
Granny? Granny?

261
00:22:31,049 --> 00:22:34,143
Granny.

262
00:22:34,219 --> 00:22:36,653
Wake up, Granny. Please!

263
00:22:38,357 --> 00:22:42,350
Please, no!
Please, no.

264
00:22:45,063 --> 00:22:47,497
Please, no!

265
00:22:57,676 --> 00:23:00,167
For Chito.

266
00:23:02,414 --> 00:23:05,110
My godfather will take care of you.

267
00:23:29,775 --> 00:23:34,303
I'm gonna go find my mom
before she forgets about me.

268
00:23:46,625 --> 00:23:50,186
Help me get there before Sunday
so she won't worry.

269
00:23:56,868 --> 00:23:59,393
I'll miss you so much, Granny.

270
00:24:13,785 --> 00:24:16,276
I'll get it.

271
00:24:17,489 --> 00:24:19,423
Who's at the door?

272
00:24:47,252 --> 00:24:49,914
Why can't you come home?

273
00:24:49,988 --> 00:24:53,480
Is she there?
I can hear her voice.

274
00:24:53,558 --> 00:24:55,719
Hello? Hello?

275
00:25:02,968 --> 00:25:05,630
Do you need anything else
before I leave?

276
00:25:05,704 --> 00:25:09,140
- You did the upstairs bathroom?
- Yes, ma'am.

277
00:25:09,207 --> 00:25:12,802
What about the plants outside?
They need to go into bigger pots.

278
00:25:16,815 --> 00:25:20,546
Oh, I'm sorry, Mrs. McKenzie,
but you didn't mention the plants.

279
00:25:20,619 --> 00:25:22,780
I'm quite sure I did.

280
00:25:22,854 --> 00:25:26,415
Well, if you'd show me which ones,
I'll do them first thing in the morning.

281
00:25:26,491 --> 00:25:28,425
Why can't you do them now?

282
00:25:29,528 --> 00:25:32,656
Well, I go to another home
in the afternoons.

283
00:25:32,731 --> 00:25:34,926
Well, then, never mind.

284
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:38,533
I suppose I'll have to do it myself.

285
00:25:39,704 --> 00:25:41,968
I can do them in the morning.
Don't worry.

286
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:44,474
Forget it. Forget it.

287
00:25:50,849 --> 00:25:53,249
How was Cruella De Vil today?

288
00:25:53,318 --> 00:25:55,047
Same as always.

289
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:56,644
Poor woman.
With a husband like that.

290
00:25:56,721 --> 00:25:59,849
Yeah.
You're going to the Snyders' now?

291
00:25:59,991 --> 00:26:02,152
Yeah, I have to pick Tommy
up at school.

292
00:26:04,429 --> 00:26:06,363
What you got there?

293
00:26:06,431 --> 00:26:08,922
A study guide for the citizenship exam.

294
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,468
If the lawyer works out,
I'll have to take it.

295
00:26:11,536 --> 00:26:13,470
I don't know any U.S. history though.

296
00:26:13,538 --> 00:26:15,836
It's easy.

297
00:26:16,608 --> 00:26:19,736
First they screwed the poor Indians.
Then they screwed the slaves.

298
00:26:19,811 --> 00:26:22,541
- And now they're screwing us Mexicans!
- Amen!

299
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:29,284
Ah, here's my date.

300
00:26:31,856 --> 00:26:34,188
Wait. Wait.

301
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:43,560
He's trying to be a rapper,
needs to look like one.

302
00:26:43,635 --> 00:26:46,331
Very convincing.

303
00:26:47,472 --> 00:26:48,962
Well, I'm off.
See you at home.

304
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:51,804
- Be careful.
- Yeah.

305
00:27:05,323 --> 00:27:07,291
I'm gonna get going.

306
00:27:09,995 --> 00:27:12,555
- Say hi to Tommy.
- Okay.

307
00:27:25,276 --> 00:27:28,006
- Okay, are you ready?
- Yeah.

308
00:27:37,288 --> 00:27:38,380
What's up, buddy?

309
00:27:38,456 --> 00:27:43,120
Okay, um, you pay now?
The money?

310
00:27:49,534 --> 00:27:52,059
Here. Could you just count that?

311
00:27:52,137 --> 00:27:54,765
Okay. Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

312
00:27:56,274 --> 00:27:58,538
- It's all here.
- Here. Help me with this.

313
00:28:08,653 --> 00:28:11,121
Are you kidding me?
They're gonna check this.

314
00:28:14,726 --> 00:28:17,058
I don't know about this.

315
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:20,764
I can do it.

316
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:29,734
- Watch your head.
- Okay.

317
00:28:31,076 --> 00:28:33,738
You okay?

318
00:28:36,748 --> 00:28:39,444
Get the bag in the back.

319
00:28:59,604 --> 00:29:01,538
I have a bad feeling about this.

320
00:29:01,606 --> 00:29:05,167
This isn't really the time to be having
bad feelings, David. We're here.

321
00:29:06,711 --> 00:29:09,805
- I just don't think it's worth it.
- Is it worth your tuition?

322
00:29:11,983 --> 00:29:14,383
You want to drop out of school,
or you want to get the money?

323
00:29:15,954 --> 00:29:17,888
It's your choice.

324
00:29:21,593 --> 00:29:24,926
Let's go.
Okay. Let's go.

325
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:38,132
Mexico/U.S. Border 2 Km.

326
00:29:39,544 --> 00:29:41,478
Are we there yet?

327
00:29:41,546 --> 00:29:45,141
- It's so hot!
- Sorry, buddy. The A.C. is broken.

328
00:29:46,184 --> 00:29:48,812
This line is so long.

329
00:29:48,887 --> 00:29:52,152
- Do we got any water?
- No, we don't have any water.

330
00:29:52,223 --> 00:29:54,885
God, it's so hot in here.
What if he passes out?

331
00:29:54,959 --> 00:29:57,826
- Shh. He's not gonna pass out.
- What if he does?

332
00:29:57,896 --> 00:29:59,727
Too hot.

333
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:01,356
You have to be quiet, Carlitos.

334
00:30:01,432 --> 00:30:03,525
Um-
Quiet!

335
00:30:03,601 --> 00:30:05,228
We are almost there, okay?

336
00:30:05,303 --> 00:30:07,601
Welcome to the United States of America.

337
00:30:07,672 --> 00:30:09,367
Okay. Here we go.

338
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:12,170
- Okay. Ready?
- Let's go.

339
00:30:16,314 --> 00:30:18,339
Afternoon, Officer.

340
00:30:18,416 --> 00:30:21,408
- Mexican or U.S. citizens?
- U.S. citizens.

341
00:30:21,486 --> 00:30:24,421
- Passports.
- Here.

342
00:30:30,195 --> 00:30:32,789
- How long were you in Mexico?
- Four days.

343
00:30:33,865 --> 00:30:35,628
Four days.

344
00:30:37,635 --> 00:30:41,401
- Get out of the car, please.
- I'm sorry. Is there a problem?

345
00:30:41,472 --> 00:30:43,406
Not yet.

346
00:30:43,474 --> 00:30:45,965
- Open the trunk, please.
- What do we do?

347
00:30:48,746 --> 00:30:51,306
Do me a favor.
Run the plates for me.

348
00:30:51,382 --> 00:30:52,940
- Today. Come on, guys.
- Just stay calm.

349
00:31:02,794 --> 00:31:07,993
Open the back door. Take out the suitcase
and place it on the table, please.

350
00:31:10,835 --> 00:31:12,393
Welcome to the United States of America.

351
00:31:12,470 --> 00:31:17,601
Please have your passports
or identification ready.

352
00:32:10,328 --> 00:32:12,819
Welcome to the United States of America.

353
00:32:12,897 --> 00:32:16,492
- Please have your passports or
identification ready. - All set.

354
00:32:20,471 --> 00:32:22,496
Thank you, Officer.

355
00:32:30,848 --> 00:32:34,375
- Okay. Thank you.
- Thank-Thank you, Officer.

356
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:38,814
Good.

357
00:32:41,492 --> 00:32:44,427
Welcome to the United States of America.

358
00:32:44,495 --> 00:32:47,487
- I think they had some parking violations.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hold on.

359
00:32:47,565 --> 00:32:50,056
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

360
00:32:51,169 --> 00:32:53,569
Uh, are you aware that
your tags are expired?

361
00:32:53,638 --> 00:32:56,436
- And you owe several hundred
dollars in parking tickets. - What?

362
00:32:56,507 --> 00:32:58,907
Looks like you'll be
spending the night here in El Paso.

363
00:32:58,977 --> 00:33:01,445
- We're impounding your car.
- No, no, no, no. Sir, um...

364
00:33:01,512 --> 00:33:04,606
we're university students
from the U.S., and-

365
00:33:04,682 --> 00:33:07,480
- You can't afford to pay the tickets.
- Well, you know how it is.

366
00:33:07,552 --> 00:33:10,180
Yeah. But you can afford
to take a trip to Mexico.

367
00:33:10,254 --> 00:33:12,381
- Let's pay right now.
- Give me that money.

368
00:33:12,457 --> 00:33:14,254
- Ma'am, please, can we just please pay now?
- Officer, please.

369
00:33:14,325 --> 00:33:15,849
Ma'am, we can pay them now.

370
00:33:15,927 --> 00:33:18,862
Sir, will you just let us
pay for the tickets now?

371
00:33:18,930 --> 00:33:21,956
There's a cheap motel in El Paso
two blocks from the D.M.V.

372
00:33:22,033 --> 00:33:25,127
You can pay for your parking tickets there.
The D.M.V. opens up at 8:00 a. m.

373
00:33:25,203 --> 00:33:28,297
Miss, there's just no way that I could
give you the money for the tickets?

374
00:33:28,373 --> 00:33:30,898
- No, you can't. Sorry.
- Get out of the car.

375
00:33:30,975 --> 00:33:33,239
- Can we go with the car to El Paso?
- Take your belongings with you.

376
00:33:33,311 --> 00:33:35,040
Lock the doors.
Roll those windows up.

377
00:33:35,113 --> 00:33:37,741
- Come on. Gotta get out.
- We need to keep our car.

378
00:33:37,815 --> 00:33:40,249
Come on. You're holding my line.
We don't got all day.

379
00:33:40,318 --> 00:33:44,049
Okay, I'm coming.
I'm coming. I'm coming.

380
00:33:50,461 --> 00:33:52,395
Our Father, Who art in heaven...

381
00:33:52,463 --> 00:33:54,499
Hallowed be Thy Name...

382
00:33:57,568 --> 00:34:00,059
What the hell were you thinking, David?

383
00:34:00,138 --> 00:34:03,130
" I'm sorry" is not
good enough right now.

384
00:34:03,207 --> 00:34:05,300
...as we forgive those who
trespass against us.

385
00:34:06,878 --> 00:34:11,611
And lead us not into temptation
but deliver us from evil.

386
00:34:11,682 --> 00:34:13,582
Amen.

387
00:34:16,954 --> 00:34:20,947
#There was a little ant

388
00:34:21,025 --> 00:34:25,928
Looking for a home

389
00:34:25,997 --> 00:34:28,022
#And here it is#

390
00:34:30,435 --> 00:34:33,097
Time to go to sleep, okay?

391
00:34:34,672 --> 00:34:37,232
- Good night, Tommy.
- Good night, Rosario.

392
00:34:37,308 --> 00:34:38,798
Good night.

393
00:34:39,811 --> 00:34:41,779
Rosario.

394
00:34:41,846 --> 00:34:44,212
- Hi.
- I'm so sorry we're late.

395
00:34:44,282 --> 00:34:46,944
- How was it?
- Oh, you know how banquets are.

396
00:34:50,555 --> 00:34:53,718
Oh, my goodness.
Are you already asleep?

397
00:34:55,593 --> 00:34:59,529
I don't think so.
You're trying to fool me, aren't you?

398
00:35:13,578 --> 00:35:17,241
- You know this guy?
- Yeah. Yeah.

399
00:35:17,315 --> 00:35:21,183
Well, actually, I forgot he offered
to give me a ride. I'm sorry.

400
00:35:21,252 --> 00:35:24,653
- It's okay.
- Thank you for the ride anyway. Thank you.

401
00:35:24,722 --> 00:35:27,589
- Good night, Rosario.
- Good night.

402
00:35:27,658 --> 00:35:31,389
- Good night, Mr. Snyder.
- Good night, Paco.

403
00:35:32,563 --> 00:35:37,000
- What are you doing here?
- Alicia said you were working late.

404
00:35:37,068 --> 00:35:39,002
Come on. I'll take you home.

405
00:35:40,238 --> 00:35:44,402
You should just date Alicia.
She's a lot more fun.

406
00:35:44,475 --> 00:35:48,844
Ain't that the truth!
But I've always liked the quiet ones.

407
00:35:49,847 --> 00:35:53,010
So, are you coming?
Or should I walk you home?

408
00:35:57,255 --> 00:35:59,189
Okay, fine.

409
00:36:17,041 --> 00:36:21,034
I know I said I liked them quiet...

410
00:36:21,112 --> 00:36:23,046
but not mute!

411
00:36:31,022 --> 00:36:33,286
Are you thinking about your son?

412
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:41,828
What you're doing
takes courage, Rosario.

413
00:36:51,175 --> 00:36:53,575
The last time I talked to him,
he sounded angry.

414
00:36:55,179 --> 00:36:57,113
I don't want him to grow up
with that anger.

415
00:36:58,382 --> 00:37:03,046
It's just... I'm hurting him more
by being here, away from him.

416
00:37:04,088 --> 00:37:07,489
He doesn't know why I left.
He only knows I left him.

417
00:37:10,595 --> 00:37:12,529
That's why I want to be with my son.

418
00:37:13,931 --> 00:37:16,126
Right now.

419
00:37:17,134 --> 00:37:19,762
So, what are you waiting for?

420
00:37:20,771 --> 00:37:22,170
But how?

421
00:37:28,279 --> 00:37:32,215
Well, do what people do here.

422
00:37:32,883 --> 00:37:36,284
I'm legal now.
I've got papers and everything.

423
00:39:13,617 --> 00:39:16,450
Bus to Dallas, leaving at Terminal 1.

424
00:39:17,455 --> 00:39:19,787
Bus from Houston, now arriving.

425
00:39:19,857 --> 00:39:22,257
Ticket to Los Angeles. How much?

426
00:39:22,326 --> 00:39:24,453
I can't sell a ticket to a minor.

427
00:39:24,528 --> 00:39:27,793
- Where's your mom and your dad?
- I'm going to see my mom.

428
00:39:27,865 --> 00:39:33,064
Then tell your dad he's gotta come
with you to buy the ticket. All right?

429
00:39:33,137 --> 00:39:35,071
Okay.

430
00:39:36,207 --> 00:39:38,334
Window 4, now open.

431
00:39:38,409 --> 00:39:41,071
- Hi, how are you today?
- Hello. Where to?

432
00:39:41,145 --> 00:39:45,309
Mr. Christopher Hamilton,
please report to the information desk.

433
00:39:51,389 --> 00:39:54,586
Yeah, I kind of like her too.

434
00:40:07,805 --> 00:40:10,365
What's the matter, kid?

435
00:40:15,746 --> 00:40:18,544
Ah, don't like cops?

436
00:40:20,251 --> 00:40:22,185
Me neither.

437
00:40:22,253 --> 00:40:24,517
Unit 21, 1022 on Hildago Ave.

438
00:40:24,588 --> 00:40:26,522
That's us.

439
00:40:30,394 --> 00:40:32,521
Bus from Austin, now arriving at Gate 1.

440
00:40:34,398 --> 00:40:36,832
Bus from San Antonio,
now arriving at Gate 2.

441
00:40:36,901 --> 00:40:40,234
- Can you help me?
- What do you need?

442
00:40:40,304 --> 00:40:43,296
Ticket to Los Angeles.

443
00:40:43,374 --> 00:40:47,037
- I have money.
- Are you trying to run away or something?

444
00:40:47,111 --> 00:40:49,705
I'm going to see my mom.

445
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:53,341
Final call.
All passengers departing for San Antonio...

446
00:40:53,417 --> 00:40:55,214
please report to Gate 1.

447
00:40:55,286 --> 00:40:58,084
Sure, kid.

448
00:40:58,155 --> 00:41:00,715
Whatever you need.

449
00:41:07,565 --> 00:41:11,433
- What's the matter? You okay?
- I come back.

450
00:41:27,184 --> 00:41:29,118
Where did you go?

451
00:41:29,186 --> 00:41:31,984
Window 2, now open.

452
00:41:32,056 --> 00:41:34,047
Do you have a car?

453
00:41:34,124 --> 00:41:37,218
You know what, kid? Forget it.

454
00:41:37,294 --> 00:41:39,728
I give you $100.

455
00:41:39,797 --> 00:41:42,960
A hundred.

456
00:41:43,033 --> 00:41:46,366
- Deal. Where we going?
- I show you.

457
00:42:07,791 --> 00:42:10,225
- The car was picked up an hour ago.
- What?

458
00:42:11,161 --> 00:42:13,561
No. No, no, no.

459
00:42:51,101 --> 00:42:52,591
So...

460
00:42:52,670 --> 00:42:55,036
where's my money?

461
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:58,270
I don't know.

462
00:43:02,212 --> 00:43:04,612
- Where's my money?
- I don't know.

463
00:43:09,286 --> 00:43:14,155
You don't know?
Yes, you know. I'm gonna tell you.

464
00:43:14,224 --> 00:43:18,183
You're gonna pay up!
That's what you're gonna do.

465
00:43:18,262 --> 00:43:22,062
Because I sure didn't drive
all around town for nothing!

466
00:43:22,132 --> 00:43:24,692
Where are we going?

467
00:43:56,500 --> 00:43:58,491
Don't move.

468
00:44:16,587 --> 00:44:18,714
- Come on.
- Let go of me!

469
00:44:18,789 --> 00:44:20,723
Be good!

470
00:44:21,458 --> 00:44:24,291
Let go of me!

471
00:44:33,971 --> 00:44:37,372
- What are you doing, Güerro?
- Mind your own business, Reina.

472
00:44:37,441 --> 00:44:40,410
- I'm not goin'
- C'mon, c'mon, get outta here!

473
00:44:40,477 --> 00:44:42,240
- I'm not goin' anywhere.
- Move, you idiot!

474
00:44:42,312 --> 00:44:45,543
- Reina!
- I said move!

475
00:44:45,616 --> 00:44:47,550
And you get the hell out of here!
You're all messed up!

476
00:44:47,618 --> 00:44:50,143
- I don't know you, woman!
- But I do know you!

477
00:44:50,220 --> 00:44:52,916
- You son of a bitch!
- No kid, no deal.

478
00:44:52,990 --> 00:44:54,924
- No kid, no deal.
- The kid owes me money.

479
00:44:54,992 --> 00:44:56,619
- No kid. No deal.
- How much?

480
00:44:56,694 --> 00:44:59,390
- A hundred bucks.
- Here, here.

481
00:44:59,463 --> 00:45:01,590
- That's not a hundred-
- Go get high as a kite!

482
00:45:03,701 --> 00:45:05,396
Jerk!

483
00:45:06,837 --> 00:45:10,603
Reina, you're such a busybody!

484
00:45:10,674 --> 00:45:13,074
You okay?

485
00:45:13,277 --> 00:45:15,711
Careful with your green cards.

486
00:45:16,046 --> 00:45:18,344
And the maps I gave you. Okay?

487
00:45:18,415 --> 00:45:20,508
- You guys are set.
- Thank you, Doña Carmen.

488
00:45:51,081 --> 00:45:53,743
What are you doing
with Carlitos's Walkman?

489
00:45:53,817 --> 00:45:55,751
What's it to you?

490
00:45:55,819 --> 00:45:57,878
I gave it to him,
that's why I'm asking.

491
00:45:57,955 --> 00:46:01,686
- He left it for me.
- What do you mean left it?

492
00:46:01,759 --> 00:46:05,217
His grandma died,
so he went looking for his mother.

493
00:46:05,295 --> 00:46:07,456
He crossed over.

494
00:46:19,810 --> 00:46:23,906
The dinner is in the oven, Mrs. McKenzie.
See you tomorrow.

495
00:46:23,981 --> 00:46:26,472
Actually, I want to
talk to you about that.

496
00:46:26,550 --> 00:46:28,609
I'm going to let you go.

497
00:46:29,853 --> 00:46:32,549
Excuse me?
Did I do something wrong?

498
00:46:32,623 --> 00:46:37,151
No, no, no, no. I've just decided
I'd like to try someone new.

499
00:46:39,196 --> 00:46:42,029
Someone new?

500
00:46:42,099 --> 00:46:45,398
But I really need this job,
Mrs. McKenzie.

501
00:46:45,469 --> 00:46:47,699
But you have another job
already, don't you?

502
00:46:47,771 --> 00:46:49,705
Well, yes.
But I need both jobs.

503
00:46:49,773 --> 00:46:51,707
I need to send some money to my kid.

504
00:46:51,775 --> 00:46:55,108
Oh, for God's sake, Rosario.
You'll find something else.

505
00:46:55,179 --> 00:46:57,443
'Cause you're young.

506
00:47:03,287 --> 00:47:07,223
Well, I need to get paid
for the last couple of days.

507
00:47:07,291 --> 00:47:09,225
I don't think so.

508
00:47:09,293 --> 00:47:12,353
But I've worked half the week.
You can't do this.

509
00:47:13,697 --> 00:47:16,894
What are you going to do,
call the police? Here.

510
00:47:20,037 --> 00:47:23,598
Ah, I just remembered.

511
00:47:23,674 --> 00:47:26,507
You're an illegal, aren't you?

512
00:47:26,577 --> 00:47:28,511
Not a good idea.

513
00:47:32,216 --> 00:47:33,979
Five...

514
00:47:34,051 --> 00:47:36,042
six...

515
00:47:36,119 --> 00:47:37,211
seven...

516
00:47:39,056 --> 00:47:40,489
eight...

517
00:47:40,557 --> 00:47:42,991
nine, ten...

518
00:47:43,060 --> 00:47:44,550
eleven!

519
00:47:48,232 --> 00:47:50,962
So, are you going to
take me to the bus?

520
00:47:51,034 --> 00:47:53,867
Not a chance! Not after
what happened this afternoon.

521
00:47:54,872 --> 00:47:57,636
You're too young to travel alone.

522
00:47:59,643 --> 00:48:01,611
Mmm.

523
00:48:01,678 --> 00:48:05,614
It's just... I have to be there
by Sunday morning.

524
00:48:05,682 --> 00:48:08,173
Well, then we'll have to
think of something.

525
00:48:08,585 --> 00:48:11,486
- Where are you, Doñita?
- Hello!

526
00:48:11,555 --> 00:48:14,251
- Good afternoon.
- Afternoon, Mrs. Reina.

527
00:48:14,324 --> 00:48:16,349
Hello.

528
00:48:16,426 --> 00:48:17,893
Who are they?

529
00:48:19,029 --> 00:48:21,520
Illegals, like you.

530
00:48:21,598 --> 00:48:24,761
Watch out.
The main man has arrived!

531
00:48:25,736 --> 00:48:29,433
What smells so good, Reina?
Meatballs!

532
00:48:29,506 --> 00:48:31,701
¡Caray!

533
00:48:34,845 --> 00:48:37,780
And who are you?

534
00:48:37,848 --> 00:48:40,442
Carlos Reyes, at your service.

535
00:48:40,517 --> 00:48:43,350
Leonardo Sanchez Nava,
nice meeting you too, buddy.

536
00:48:47,624 --> 00:48:49,649
Your tenants are getting
younger every day.

537
00:48:52,129 --> 00:48:53,721
Wash your hands!

538
00:48:53,864 --> 00:48:56,264
- Go on, dirty bastards.
- Help me set the table.

539
00:48:56,733 --> 00:48:57,722
Come on.

540
00:48:57,801 --> 00:49:00,133
Do we look like
the seven dwarfs to you?

541
00:49:06,543 --> 00:49:09,137
Damn, this is good!

542
00:49:09,212 --> 00:49:12,272
And it'd be even better with a beer.

543
00:49:12,416 --> 00:49:15,078
- Yeah, a cold one.
- Hey!

544
00:49:15,986 --> 00:49:19,422
Don't get Reina mad.
You know the rules.

545
00:49:19,489 --> 00:49:21,013
No booze.

546
00:49:21,091 --> 00:49:24,185
We just gotta take it...
like men.

547
00:49:24,261 --> 00:49:27,321
Unless... my "Chivas" are
playing against "America"!

548
00:49:30,100 --> 00:49:31,499
There you have it. Cheers!

549
00:49:35,605 --> 00:49:36,765
Move back, move back!

550
00:49:36,840 --> 00:49:38,899
- Let me see!
- Watch it there!

551
00:49:39,977 --> 00:49:43,777
- There he goes!
- Shoot, shoot!

552
00:49:44,948 --> 00:49:46,882
Goal!

553
00:49:50,854 --> 00:49:52,549
...a classic! The "Chivas" score!

554
00:49:52,622 --> 00:49:54,783
You thought they'd beat us!

555
00:49:55,325 --> 00:49:57,759
A fluke, buddy. Just a fluke.

556
00:49:57,828 --> 00:50:00,194
The meatballs!

557
00:50:09,806 --> 00:50:11,740
- That's who we're picking up.
- Them?

558
00:50:23,020 --> 00:50:26,478
- Who's this?
- We're taking him to L.A.

559
00:50:27,157 --> 00:50:29,785
- We still got three jobs to do!
- So he'll come with us.

560
00:50:29,860 --> 00:50:31,760
To the fields?

561
00:50:33,363 --> 00:50:36,230
- Are you kidding me?
- Do I sound like I'm kidding?

562
00:50:37,234 --> 00:50:40,499
- Then you're being stupid!
- Okay, let's get going!

563
00:50:40,570 --> 00:50:43,300
If you don't like it,
get another ride. C'mon!

564
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:46,501
Okay, move over.

565
00:50:47,244 --> 00:50:48,506
Make room, buddy.
Watch it!

566
00:50:53,917 --> 00:50:55,817
- Watch it! Cool it!
- Move the backpack.

567
00:50:59,189 --> 00:51:02,989
#He came from the sky
But he's not a plane

568
00:51:03,060 --> 00:51:06,621
He arrived in his spaceship
Right from Krypton

569
00:51:06,696 --> 00:51:08,664
So he's obviously not an American

570
00:51:08,732 --> 00:51:11,599
Listen, everyone. Put on the hats.

571
00:51:11,668 --> 00:51:14,296
Boxes are over there.
Questions?

572
00:51:15,305 --> 00:51:18,138
- No.
- Then, get to work!

573
00:51:18,208 --> 00:51:21,006
And though it hurts to admit it
Superman is an illegal

574
00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:25,674
He's a journalist
Well, so am I

575
00:51:25,749 --> 00:51:29,651
He didn't serve in the army
What's up with that

576
00:51:29,719 --> 00:51:33,086
Well, he's blond
blue eyed and well built

577
00:51:33,457 --> 00:51:37,120
And I am dark
fat and really short

578
00:51:40,897 --> 00:51:43,388
What are you doing?
Get back on that pickup!

579
00:51:43,467 --> 00:51:45,662
I wanna work.

580
00:51:45,735 --> 00:51:49,398
Hey! Put this on.

581
00:51:49,539 --> 00:51:52,508
He doesn't pay taxes
Acts like a cop

582
00:51:52,576 --> 00:51:56,171
And flies without a license

583
00:51:56,246 --> 00:51:58,510
Cut close to the vine, okay?

584
00:51:58,582 --> 00:52:00,880
Okay.

585
00:52:01,952 --> 00:52:04,250
Hi, um- Hi, ma'am.

586
00:52:04,321 --> 00:52:07,518
I'm looking for a job.
Do you think you can help me?

587
00:52:07,591 --> 00:52:09,525
Not right now.

588
00:52:11,061 --> 00:52:13,529
I've got references.

589
00:52:13,597 --> 00:52:17,033
- Sorry.
- Okay. Thank you.

590
00:52:29,913 --> 00:52:32,780
Hey, be careful.
Don't rub your face, buddy.

591
00:52:32,849 --> 00:52:34,612
Be very careful!

592
00:52:38,288 --> 00:52:41,985
Why do they let him work

593
00:52:42,058 --> 00:52:45,892
He has no Social Security
and no green card

594
00:52:45,962 --> 00:52:49,125
How can he fly without a license

595
00:52:49,199 --> 00:52:52,965
And still be called Superman

596
00:53:08,885 --> 00:53:11,979
We should kick Superman
out of this nation

597
00:53:12,055 --> 00:53:15,513
And send him back to Krypton
if we dare

598
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:19,654
Where is the I.N.S.
when you need them

599
00:53:19,729 --> 00:53:23,893
'Cause let's face it
His back is as wet as mine#

600
00:53:39,583 --> 00:53:41,244
We need your identification.

601
00:53:41,318 --> 00:53:43,843
- Show me your green card.
- Identification, please.

602
00:53:45,021 --> 00:53:49,481
Immigration! Watch out!
The I.N.S! Let's go!

603
00:53:49,559 --> 00:53:51,754
The "Migra", hurry!
Buddy!

604
00:53:53,663 --> 00:53:55,756
Round 'em up, guys. Let's round them up.

605
00:53:55,832 --> 00:53:58,357
This way!
Let's go! Run!

606
00:54:02,372 --> 00:54:04,363
The "Migra". Let's go!

607
00:54:04,441 --> 00:54:07,171
Stand still. Do not move.

608
00:54:10,947 --> 00:54:14,610
- Look. Over there!
- Hey, come back here!

609
00:54:14,684 --> 00:54:18,051
Hey, Chop Suey. That way.
That way. That way.

610
00:54:18,121 --> 00:54:21,557
Stop! Stop him!

611
00:54:22,525 --> 00:54:26,621
Show your hands.

612
00:54:26,696 --> 00:54:30,393
I repeat. Show your hands.
Do not make me run.

613
00:54:30,467 --> 00:54:33,300
Hurry up. There are two in the corner.

614
00:54:33,370 --> 00:54:36,134
I got these over here.

615
00:54:49,219 --> 00:54:51,153
Come on. Come on!

616
00:54:55,792 --> 00:54:57,657
I need some help over here.

617
00:54:58,161 --> 00:55:02,393
God, Buddy, where are you?
Damn it!

618
00:55:05,902 --> 00:55:08,393
Stay down. Stop!

619
00:55:08,471 --> 00:55:11,838
Stop! Stop!

620
00:56:12,802 --> 00:56:16,568
Hey!

621
00:56:16,639 --> 00:56:18,573
Anybody still here?

622
00:56:20,310 --> 00:56:22,244
Guys!

623
00:56:27,884 --> 00:56:30,409
Damn it!

624
00:56:38,928 --> 00:56:40,759
What are we gonna do?

625
00:56:42,432 --> 00:56:45,128
We? What are you gonna do?

626
00:56:45,201 --> 00:56:47,965
I travel alone.

627
00:57:05,989 --> 00:57:09,220
Wait!

628
00:58:21,197 --> 00:58:23,131
Can I get a ride?

629
00:58:30,773 --> 00:58:32,764
- Hi, there.
- How are you?

630
00:58:32,842 --> 00:58:35,367
Where's the kid?

631
00:58:35,445 --> 00:58:38,812
- Wasn't he with you?
- No. I don't know him.

632
00:58:45,255 --> 00:58:47,189
You almost left me.

633
00:58:49,459 --> 00:58:52,394
- Hello. Hello. Carlos Reyes.
- Hernan.

634
00:58:52,462 --> 00:58:53,622
- Carlitos. Jorge.
- Carlos.

635
00:58:53,696 --> 00:58:56,426
- Oscar. How are you?
- How's it going, Carlos?

636
00:59:00,003 --> 00:59:01,937
Enrique.

637
00:59:04,874 --> 00:59:07,570
How did you get so dirty, son?

638
00:59:07,644 --> 00:59:10,306
The I.N.S. almost got us.

639
00:59:10,380 --> 00:59:13,349
- Oh, really?
- But that was nothing.

640
00:59:13,416 --> 00:59:17,614
Crossing the border,
that was hard.

641
00:59:17,687 --> 00:59:22,750
But who cares? It was worth it.

642
00:59:22,825 --> 00:59:27,421
I'd do anything for my mom.
I'm gonna go see her.

643
00:59:31,935 --> 00:59:35,029
- And I was just trying to help him out.
- Are you musicians?

644
00:59:35,104 --> 00:59:39,234
- Yes.
- We're playing at a dance in Tucson.

645
00:59:39,309 --> 00:59:41,436
- On Main Street?
- What kind of music do you play?

646
00:59:41,511 --> 00:59:44,002
Songs that tell people's stories.

647
00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:48,574
- Their lives and their dreams.
- Like yours.

648
00:59:48,651 --> 00:59:51,085
How 'bout a song
to cheer him up, Jorge?

649
00:59:51,154 --> 00:59:53,315
- Yes.
- You want stories?

650
00:59:53,389 --> 00:59:58,156
When I was a kid-

651
01:00:00,964 --> 01:00:04,866
I'm not afraid of danger

652
01:00:04,934 --> 01:00:09,303
#A life without risk
isn't worth living

653
01:00:09,372 --> 01:00:14,309
#And when it comes to loved ones

654
01:00:14,377 --> 01:00:18,040
#You have to find a way

655
01:00:19,048 --> 01:00:22,074
I won't give up

656
01:00:23,319 --> 01:00:25,981
Until I have you close to me

657
01:00:26,055 --> 01:00:31,254
- That's you, Carlos.
- For love I could stop

658
01:00:31,327 --> 01:00:34,660
#A bullet with my chest

659
01:00:36,799 --> 01:00:39,927
For love I will cross

660
01:00:40,003 --> 01:00:43,769
#Against all odds

661
01:00:45,141 --> 01:00:50,670
So for love I will cross

662
01:00:50,747 --> 01:00:54,615
The border without fear#

663
01:01:01,357 --> 01:01:04,121
Wake up, Carlos. Wake up!

664
01:01:04,193 --> 01:01:06,957
This is where you get off.

665
01:01:07,030 --> 01:01:09,294
We're turning onto that dirt road.

666
01:01:09,365 --> 01:01:13,392
Thanks for the ride... and the song.

667
01:01:13,469 --> 01:01:15,699
- Bye!
- Hope you find her, Carlitos.

668
01:01:17,974 --> 01:01:19,908
Bye!

669
01:01:37,393 --> 01:01:40,226
- Where are we going?
- That's enough!

670
01:01:40,296 --> 01:01:44,357
Go on. Get outta here!
You're like a puppy! Get!

671
01:01:47,403 --> 01:01:50,736
The backpack- Get the backpack.

672
01:01:50,807 --> 01:01:52,900
Hey!

673
01:01:58,014 --> 01:02:00,778
Wait up, Son!

674
01:02:00,850 --> 01:02:03,842
You're not traveling alone.

675
01:02:07,590 --> 01:02:09,922
Where do you think you're going?

676
01:02:09,992 --> 01:02:13,257
I've gotta get to L.A.
before Sunday morning.

677
01:02:13,329 --> 01:02:16,856
- I'm gonna hitch a ride.
- Hitch a ride?

678
01:02:16,933 --> 01:02:19,367
Are you nuts?

679
01:02:19,435 --> 01:02:23,132
You can't hitchhike all the way there.
It's too far. Look-

680
01:02:25,875 --> 01:02:28,867
If I were you, I'd go to the police.

681
01:02:28,945 --> 01:02:31,937
- They'll send you back to Mexico-
- I'm not going back!

682
01:02:33,483 --> 01:02:36,714
Get back here!
Your name... Juanito, was it?

683
01:02:36,786 --> 01:02:39,550
- Carlitos!
- Whatever. Carlitos.

684
01:02:39,622 --> 01:02:41,681
I can't be responsible
for a little kid, okay?

685
01:02:42,959 --> 01:02:46,395
I have enough problems without
some kid tagging along!

686
01:02:46,462 --> 01:02:48,828
I am not a little kid.
I am nine years old!

687
01:02:48,898 --> 01:02:50,832
Yeah, you're really old!

688
01:02:52,135 --> 01:02:55,127
Let's find out where
the police station is.

689
01:02:55,204 --> 01:02:57,399
- I'll drop you off around there.
- Around there?

690
01:02:57,473 --> 01:02:59,839
What the hell do you want me to do?

691
01:03:01,277 --> 01:03:04,075
Get myself caught
so they can send me back?

692
01:03:05,148 --> 01:03:09,050
It was hard enough getting across!
I almost got killed!

693
01:03:09,118 --> 01:03:11,848
If you wanna go, then go!

694
01:03:11,921 --> 01:03:14,321
I'm not going back! That's for sure!

695
01:03:17,660 --> 01:03:20,094
Then come up with a better plan
than hitchhiking to L.A.

696
01:03:21,631 --> 01:03:23,963
We could look for work.

697
01:03:24,033 --> 01:03:26,297
I just need enough for a bus fare.

698
01:03:26,369 --> 01:03:28,360
Oh, right. Just like that, huh?

699
01:03:28,437 --> 01:03:32,339
Hi, I'm nine, and I can't do anything.
Can you give me a job?

700
01:03:32,408 --> 01:03:34,740
Who do you think
will hire a little kid?

701
01:03:34,811 --> 01:03:38,212
Oh, sorry, a nine-year-old man!

702
01:03:38,281 --> 01:03:40,408
- Eh?
- Wanna bet?

703
01:04:10,847 --> 01:04:15,409
Done.

704
01:04:15,484 --> 01:04:19,215
Who could turn down
such a good deal? Two for one.

705
01:04:19,288 --> 01:04:23,224
A good deal for you.
I'm not giving you half my salary.

706
01:04:23,292 --> 01:04:27,592
- I'll find work on my own.
- Go look someplace else then.

707
01:04:27,663 --> 01:04:30,632
I gave the kid the only job I have.

708
01:04:30,700 --> 01:04:33,635
I told him I can only hire one,
but he said he's with you.

709
01:04:33,703 --> 01:04:35,933
Had to take you both or nothing.

710
01:04:36,005 --> 01:04:39,304
The problem is, around here
you ain't gonna find nothing.

711
01:04:39,375 --> 01:04:42,071
Come on. Let's do it!

712
01:04:42,144 --> 01:04:45,511
They're even gonna give us
a place to sleep. Come on!

713
01:04:47,950 --> 01:04:50,646
...and coming up,
gentlemen, you'll feel vertigo!

714
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:54,019
But right now, let's talk about-

715
01:04:54,090 --> 01:04:56,149
I looked for work all day,
and nothing.

716
01:04:59,729 --> 01:05:01,663
I think I'm going back
to Mexico, Licha.

717
01:05:03,666 --> 01:05:06,533
- You can't!
- Why not?

718
01:05:08,371 --> 01:05:11,534
Because you've worked too hard
to get this far! That's why!

719
01:05:14,577 --> 01:05:18,138
And what's so great
about our lives, huh?

720
01:05:18,214 --> 01:05:22,480
Always hiding from the I.N.S.,
living in a garage...

721
01:05:22,551 --> 01:05:25,782
and worst of all,
always wanting to be somewhere else.

722
01:05:29,292 --> 01:05:32,386
My son needs me and I need him.

723
01:05:32,461 --> 01:05:35,191
You know I'm here
because I love him.

724
01:05:35,264 --> 01:05:38,165
But that's what I'm sacrificing
if I stay.

725
01:05:39,302 --> 01:05:41,964
I finally got it.

726
01:05:51,147 --> 01:05:53,741
Then use that big head God gave you!

727
01:05:59,622 --> 01:06:01,886
Get your son over here.

728
01:06:03,025 --> 01:06:07,394
For once in your life, Rosario,
let someone help you!

729
01:06:09,999 --> 01:06:12,490
Hey!

730
01:06:12,568 --> 01:06:15,036
- Hello!
- Hi.

731
01:06:17,440 --> 01:06:21,069
I forgot my bleach.
You girls have any?

732
01:06:21,143 --> 01:06:23,737
I do.

733
01:06:28,751 --> 01:06:31,345
Really?

734
01:06:31,420 --> 01:06:33,354
He even washes his own clothes.

735
01:06:33,422 --> 01:06:35,356
They don't make them
like that anymore. Trust me.

736
01:06:38,361 --> 01:06:40,295
Okay.

737
01:06:45,501 --> 01:06:48,902
- This is all I have.
- Thanks.

738
01:06:58,681 --> 01:07:00,979
Hey, Paco.

739
01:07:02,051 --> 01:07:04,986
- Got a minute?
- Always.

740
01:07:32,048 --> 01:07:35,279
Let's see who's using who

741
01:07:35,351 --> 01:07:40,118
#Are you using me
Or am I using you

742
01:07:40,189 --> 01:07:44,182
#You're spreading rumors about me

743
01:07:44,260 --> 01:07:47,320
You're spreading rumors about me

744
01:07:47,396 --> 01:07:49,762
Everywhere I go

745
01:07:49,832 --> 01:07:53,529
People call me a user

746
01:07:53,602 --> 01:07:56,366
Let's dance, cutie.

747
01:07:58,007 --> 01:08:01,135
#But baby, you are the user#
- No way.

748
01:08:04,914 --> 01:08:12,878
#You left me
You didn't really love me

749
01:08:12,955 --> 01:08:16,413
#And I suffered night and day

750
01:08:18,994 --> 01:08:22,191
I left you
'cause I didn't love you

751
01:08:22,264 --> 01:08:26,394
You wouldn't give me money
even for the groceries

752
01:08:27,736 --> 01:08:31,467
#You wouldn't take me out
even to get gas

753
01:08:31,540 --> 01:08:35,408
- I'm not the user
- I'm not the user

754
01:08:35,478 --> 01:08:38,538
- I'm not the user
- No, I'm not

755
01:08:38,614 --> 01:08:43,210
- Yes, you are
- So who's the real user#

756
01:08:43,285 --> 01:08:47,085
I'm not the user
No, I'm not

757
01:08:47,156 --> 01:08:49,716
- You or I
- Guys, guys.

758
01:08:49,792 --> 01:08:51,726
#You or I

759
01:08:51,794 --> 01:08:55,025
Hey! Keep it down.
We can hear you outside.

760
01:08:57,500 --> 01:09:01,903
- How.
- You see? No, wait-

761
01:09:16,952 --> 01:09:19,250
We work again tomorrow.

762
01:09:19,321 --> 01:09:21,289
Then I'll put you
on the last bus, okay?

763
01:09:21,357 --> 01:09:23,518
Enough of this Good Samaritan bullshit.
It ain't Christmas!

764
01:09:26,495 --> 01:09:30,761
You'll get to L.A. Saturday morning
like you wanted.

765
01:09:32,368 --> 01:09:35,303
- What about you?
- Not me.

766
01:09:36,338 --> 01:09:38,966
I'm going the other way.

767
01:09:39,041 --> 01:09:40,975
To New York.

768
01:09:42,444 --> 01:09:45,072
I've got friends there
that can get me work.

769
01:10:09,238 --> 01:10:11,229
My mom said that...

770
01:10:12,675 --> 01:10:15,075
when I missed her...

771
01:10:16,579 --> 01:10:18,513
I should look at the moon...

772
01:10:20,082 --> 01:10:22,812
'cause she'd be looking
at it too...

773
01:10:26,088 --> 01:10:30,149
so I could feel close to her...

774
01:10:32,761 --> 01:10:34,729
and not be so sad.

775
01:11:38,494 --> 01:11:40,428
Wanna know something?

776
01:11:41,630 --> 01:11:43,621
Go to sleep, Carlitos.

777
01:11:47,936 --> 01:11:49,870
My dad lives here.

778
01:11:52,441 --> 01:11:54,375
Your dad?

779
01:11:55,444 --> 01:11:57,378
Why haven't you called him?

780
01:11:59,515 --> 01:12:03,042
Because I don't know him.
I've never even met him.

781
01:12:03,118 --> 01:12:05,052
Hmm.

782
01:12:09,725 --> 01:12:11,716
What's his name?

783
01:12:11,794 --> 01:12:16,231
Oscar. Oscar Aguilar Pons.

784
01:12:20,169 --> 01:12:22,034
Hey.

785
01:12:24,440 --> 01:12:27,603
- You wanna meet him?
- What for?

786
01:12:27,676 --> 01:12:29,610
He hasn't bothered for nine years.

787
01:12:32,681 --> 01:12:34,911
People change, Carlitos.

788
01:12:36,285 --> 01:12:38,651
You could finally have a dad.

789
01:12:38,721 --> 01:12:42,657
Or at least get a ride to L.A.

790
01:12:45,561 --> 01:12:47,495
Eh?

791
01:12:48,797 --> 01:12:50,822
Good night, Enrique.

792
01:12:50,899 --> 01:12:53,265
Good night, Carlitos.

793
01:13:50,959 --> 01:13:52,893
What if he's not there?

794
01:13:54,863 --> 01:13:58,355
Go on! He said he'd be here.

795
01:13:58,434 --> 01:14:00,368
Don't chicken out.

796
01:14:01,970 --> 01:14:03,961
Oscar Aguilar.

797
01:14:20,823 --> 01:14:22,757
Are you Carlitos?

798
01:14:38,006 --> 01:14:39,940
Ketchup?

799
01:14:40,008 --> 01:14:41,999
- Yes.
- Yes.

800
01:14:42,077 --> 01:14:44,011
Mustard?

801
01:14:44,079 --> 01:14:46,047
- No.
- No.

802
01:15:02,130 --> 01:15:04,064
Aren't you gonna ask me anything?

803
01:15:06,768 --> 01:15:09,464
What do you do here?

804
01:15:09,538 --> 01:15:11,768
I unload trucks...

805
01:15:11,840 --> 01:15:14,138
but I also go to night school.

806
01:15:14,209 --> 01:15:16,143
Aren't you too old to go to school?

807
01:15:17,746 --> 01:15:21,273
I know, but it took me a while.

808
01:15:23,785 --> 01:15:25,719
Where's your mother?

809
01:15:27,723 --> 01:15:29,987
In Los Angeles.

810
01:15:31,793 --> 01:15:34,921
- Can you take me to her?
- Rosario isn't with you?

811
01:15:36,965 --> 01:15:39,991
- I'm traveling alone.
- How long has she been in L.A.?

812
01:15:42,170 --> 01:15:44,297
- Four years.
- Four years?

813
01:15:45,807 --> 01:15:48,298
That's a long time
to be away, isn't it?

814
01:15:50,078 --> 01:15:52,012
Not as long as you.

815
01:15:54,116 --> 01:15:56,050
I'd never even met you.

816
01:16:03,492 --> 01:16:08,122
But, if you take me to L.A...

817
01:16:09,131 --> 01:16:11,258
maybe you and Mom can make up.

818
01:16:18,040 --> 01:16:19,974
She would never forgive me.

819
01:16:22,411 --> 01:16:26,745
I think she would.
I know I would.

820
01:16:38,460 --> 01:16:40,394
You look a lot like your mom.

821
01:16:47,869 --> 01:16:49,928
Rosario and I were unstoppable.

822
01:16:52,541 --> 01:16:54,839
We used to get along really well.

823
01:16:54,910 --> 01:16:57,811
So? Will you take me?

824
01:17:06,321 --> 01:17:08,812
Yes.

825
01:17:43,025 --> 01:17:46,552
Are you excited to tell
Carlitos the good news?

826
01:17:46,628 --> 01:17:48,562
Yeah.

827
01:17:51,233 --> 01:17:53,531
Stop requested.

828
01:17:54,836 --> 01:17:56,770
Wow.

829
01:17:57,773 --> 01:18:01,800
Only you would plan
a wedding in two days.

830
01:18:02,811 --> 01:18:05,439
Well, if I'm going to do it,
it might as well be quick.

831
01:18:06,448 --> 01:18:08,382
Before I change my mind.

832
01:18:21,830 --> 01:18:24,060
Here you go, Charlie. On the house.

833
01:18:50,859 --> 01:18:53,089
- Coffee?
- Please.

834
01:19:25,227 --> 01:19:28,924
Psst! Hey!

835
01:19:30,165 --> 01:19:34,101
Give him a little longer.
He'll show up. Okay?

836
01:19:59,761 --> 01:20:02,662
Hey, hey.

837
01:20:02,731 --> 01:20:06,565
It's okay. Calm down.

838
01:20:09,805 --> 01:20:11,739
Why don't my parents
want to be with me?

839
01:20:14,543 --> 01:20:16,477
You know what? You're right.

840
01:20:16,545 --> 01:20:19,514
Take me to the police station
so they'll send me back.

841
01:21:20,242 --> 01:21:22,176
Is that her?

842
01:21:24,546 --> 01:21:26,480
Let me see.

843
01:21:30,018 --> 01:21:34,580
- She's pretty.
- What good is that? I never see her.

844
01:21:34,656 --> 01:21:37,216
Wait a minute!

845
01:21:37,292 --> 01:21:40,159
I know you're pissed off,
but don't take it out on her.

846
01:21:41,263 --> 01:21:43,424
You can't blame her
for what your dad did.

847
01:21:44,499 --> 01:21:47,400
You mother loves you,
Carlitos, a lot.

848
01:21:52,073 --> 01:21:55,406
- Then why did she go so far away?
- What do you mean, " why"?

849
01:21:55,477 --> 01:21:57,604
So you could have a better life.

850
01:21:57,679 --> 01:22:00,546
You ungrateful brat!

851
01:22:02,817 --> 01:22:05,411
Tell me how you've liked
these past few days.

852
01:22:06,554 --> 01:22:08,488
You liked picking tomatoes?

853
01:22:10,425 --> 01:22:12,791
Hiding from the I.N.S.? Eh?

854
01:22:14,029 --> 01:22:17,465
Or washing dishes just for
a meal and a place to sleep?

855
01:22:19,634 --> 01:22:25,368
No one chooses to live this way, Carlitos,
unless they've got a good reason.

856
01:22:25,440 --> 01:22:30,036
I'm sure that for her,
you're that reason!

857
01:22:43,058 --> 01:22:44,992
Give it back!

858
01:22:45,060 --> 01:22:46,994
What?

859
01:22:47,062 --> 01:22:49,257
She's not that hot.

860
01:22:58,139 --> 01:23:00,107
Got one in a bathing suit?

861
01:23:08,450 --> 01:23:10,418
She said I can't wait
to see your face

862
01:23:12,721 --> 01:23:17,351
When you see my old hometown

863
01:23:17,425 --> 01:23:20,588
When this bread box
touches down#

864
01:23:20,662 --> 01:23:24,359
- Damn!
- What?

865
01:23:24,432 --> 01:23:27,265
- That's it. We're screwed!
- Why?

866
01:23:27,335 --> 01:23:30,634
Because that's
not an address, Carlitos!

867
01:23:30,705 --> 01:23:33,606
That's the address
my mom puts on all her letters!

868
01:23:33,675 --> 01:23:36,542
It's a P.O. box.
Don't you see all the little boxes?

869
01:23:45,820 --> 01:23:48,948
A lot of people use them
so the I.N.S. can't find them.

870
01:23:49,024 --> 01:23:51,356
Understand?

871
01:24:00,335 --> 01:24:02,269
Look, kid.

872
01:24:05,206 --> 01:24:09,700
Unless you've got a phone number
or a real address...

873
01:24:12,414 --> 01:24:14,348
I've got no place to take you.

874
01:24:45,880 --> 01:24:48,644
- I know. I got it!
- What?

875
01:24:48,716 --> 01:24:51,981
Mom calls me from a pay phone.
We could wait for her there!

876
01:24:52,053 --> 01:24:54,544
She has to call me tomorrow morning.

877
01:24:54,622 --> 01:24:57,113
Sure! Of course!

878
01:24:57,192 --> 01:25:01,151
There're only a couple pay phones
in all of L.A., so piece of cake!

879
01:25:06,201 --> 01:25:08,965
Do you have any idea where
that pay phone is?

880
01:25:09,037 --> 01:25:11,904
Right here. In East L.A.

881
01:25:11,973 --> 01:25:16,910
There's a corner...
with a Domino's pizza...

882
01:25:18,480 --> 01:25:23,645
a bus stop, a Laundromat...

883
01:25:23,718 --> 01:25:27,484
a party store and a mural!

884
01:25:27,555 --> 01:25:29,887
We could-

885
01:25:29,958 --> 01:25:34,418
- You're nuts, kid, you know that?
- Come on! Let's go!

886
01:25:43,371 --> 01:25:47,535
There! The bus stop,
the mural, the phone.

887
01:25:47,609 --> 01:25:51,375
- And the pizza place?
- There it is!

888
01:25:54,415 --> 01:25:56,349
It's not a Domino's.

889
01:26:00,155 --> 01:26:02,089
Come on.

890
01:26:02,157 --> 01:26:05,251
Look. A Laundromat...

891
01:26:08,496 --> 01:26:10,430
a mural.

892
01:26:12,066 --> 01:26:16,469
And look, a phone booth
and... another mural.

893
01:26:17,472 --> 01:26:20,635
- Huh?
- And the pizzeria?

894
01:26:25,880 --> 01:26:28,075
Let's keep looking.

895
01:26:33,188 --> 01:26:36,123
Excuse me, is there a Laundromat
around here?

896
01:26:42,964 --> 01:26:45,455
I don't know about you,
but I'm beat.

897
01:26:45,533 --> 01:26:47,933
My dogs are barking.

898
01:26:48,002 --> 01:26:50,163
Once more. Please.

899
01:26:52,874 --> 01:26:54,808
Okay, then.

900
01:26:57,512 --> 01:27:02,711
Look, a phone booth
and another one of those murals.

901
01:27:02,784 --> 01:27:06,720
It's not here. I just asked.

902
01:27:22,503 --> 01:27:24,971
Those two are taking
too long in there.

903
01:27:25,039 --> 01:27:29,499
- Hmm.
- Maybe they just couldn't wait for dessert!

904
01:27:45,159 --> 01:27:47,093
It's just that-

905
01:27:49,030 --> 01:27:51,328
I thought I could
go through with it...

906
01:27:55,737 --> 01:27:57,796
but I can't, Paco.

907
01:27:59,307 --> 01:28:01,366
I can't.

908
01:28:04,979 --> 01:28:07,573
I'm going back home...

909
01:28:10,451 --> 01:28:12,578
with my son.

910
01:28:13,988 --> 01:28:16,752
I'm so sorry.

911
01:28:30,972 --> 01:28:33,133
You know-

912
01:28:33,207 --> 01:28:36,074
I don't see why
we can't go on with the party.

913
01:28:37,312 --> 01:28:39,837
Nobody died here.

914
01:28:39,914 --> 01:28:43,350
Let's have-

915
01:28:45,853 --> 01:28:50,222
Let's have a going away party
for a wonderful woman.

916
01:28:50,291 --> 01:28:52,225
Paco.

917
01:28:52,293 --> 01:28:55,285
Don't be sad.

918
01:28:55,363 --> 01:28:57,297
It'll be a nice party for you.

919
01:28:57,365 --> 01:28:59,697
C'mon, let's have some fun.

920
01:28:59,767 --> 01:29:01,792
Paco.

921
01:29:44,045 --> 01:29:46,013
My album
Carlos Reyes.

922
01:29:51,819 --> 01:29:55,778
Carlitos.
My little boy, where are you?

923
01:30:05,400 --> 01:30:07,334
Mom's jobs.

924
01:30:16,043 --> 01:30:17,977
- Hello?
- Hello.

925
01:30:19,680 --> 01:30:21,614
My name is Carmen.

926
01:30:23,351 --> 01:30:26,047
I call to Mexico.

927
01:30:26,120 --> 01:30:30,113
- Make call to- to Rosario.
- She's not here right now.

928
01:30:30,191 --> 01:30:32,716
- Is there something wrong?
- Yes.

929
01:30:32,794 --> 01:30:34,728
It's emergency.

930
01:30:34,796 --> 01:30:38,061
From Carli... Carlitos.

931
01:30:43,204 --> 01:30:45,138
So you couldn't
go through with it, huh?

932
01:30:52,613 --> 01:30:57,550
Who would've thought?
Rosario, a romantic!

933
01:30:57,618 --> 01:31:00,553
- It's not that.
- Then what?

934
01:31:00,621 --> 01:31:04,421
I just think if you're gonna get married,
it should be for love, right?

935
01:31:04,492 --> 01:31:07,188
And that's not being a romantic?

936
01:31:07,261 --> 01:31:09,195
Well, romantic or not...

937
01:31:10,698 --> 01:31:13,258
I'm glad I'm going back.

938
01:31:13,334 --> 01:31:15,325
And you know what?

939
01:31:15,403 --> 01:31:18,099
I'll be there when Carlitos
gets a mustache.

940
01:31:26,647 --> 01:31:30,549
I like this song a lot.
I love it!

941
01:31:30,618 --> 01:31:32,552
Be right back.

942
01:31:41,896 --> 01:31:45,525
- Don't you love this song?
- Yeah.

943
01:31:48,536 --> 01:31:50,470
Wanna dance?

944
01:31:51,672 --> 01:31:53,606
Don't know.

945
01:31:54,876 --> 01:31:57,504
That's okay. I do.

946
01:31:57,578 --> 01:32:01,947
Just hold on to me
and follow my lead. Yes?

947
01:32:04,952 --> 01:32:08,410
Come on. Try it. Let's go.

948
01:32:18,599 --> 01:32:22,000
Just relax and feel the music.

949
01:32:27,174 --> 01:32:29,938
- Very good. Not bad.
- Really?

950
01:32:35,516 --> 01:32:38,644
How's that?

951
01:32:40,655 --> 01:32:44,216
Hey! You fooled me.

952
01:32:45,660 --> 01:32:48,356
Why did you do that?

953
01:32:48,429 --> 01:32:51,592
You dance really well.
Like a dance teacher.

954
01:33:59,300 --> 01:34:01,393
I've been looking for you for 3 days.

955
01:34:01,469 --> 01:34:05,269
- I didn't know where to reach you.
- How could this happen?

956
01:34:05,339 --> 01:34:07,773
He was afraid Josefina
and Manuel would take him.

957
01:34:07,842 --> 01:34:11,175
- Why would he think that?
- Look, Rosario.

958
01:34:11,245 --> 01:34:13,475
Your mother passed away.

959
01:34:16,117 --> 01:34:18,051
What?

960
01:34:19,587 --> 01:34:21,748
When?

961
01:34:21,822 --> 01:34:26,589
Last Tuesday.
She died in her sleep.

962
01:34:26,661 --> 01:34:28,720
Your godfather
took care of everything...

963
01:34:28,796 --> 01:34:31,663
so don't worry about that right now.

964
01:34:34,802 --> 01:34:39,865
Look, Carmela, if you had anything
to do with this, I swear to you-

965
01:34:39,940 --> 01:34:43,205
How can you think
I would ever smuggle your son across?

966
01:34:43,277 --> 01:34:48,544
Look, Rosario. Please listen to me.
I beg you, stay right there.

967
01:34:48,616 --> 01:34:53,553
How can I just stay here
and not do anything?

968
01:34:53,621 --> 01:34:56,988
I have all my contacts at the border
looking for him, but nobody's seen him.

969
01:34:57,058 --> 01:34:58,992
He must be on his way there!

970
01:35:01,929 --> 01:35:04,261
- Or something happened to him.
- Don't say that.

971
01:35:04,331 --> 01:35:07,892
God forbid!
Please, Rosario, give me a few hours.

972
01:35:13,407 --> 01:35:15,341
Okay, Carmela.

973
01:35:29,056 --> 01:35:31,490
My little boy!

974
01:35:46,907 --> 01:35:48,841
Can I tell you a secret?

975
01:35:51,078 --> 01:35:53,546
Another one? I don't think so.

976
01:35:55,082 --> 01:35:58,540
Remember what happened when
you told me about your dad?

977
01:36:00,921 --> 01:36:02,946
You said people change.

978
01:36:05,226 --> 01:36:07,160
When I came on this trip...

979
01:36:08,462 --> 01:36:10,396
I thought my mom
didn't love me anymore.

980
01:36:13,100 --> 01:36:15,466
But I was wrong.

981
01:36:35,356 --> 01:36:37,290
Thanks for everything, Enrique.

982
01:36:57,344 --> 01:37:01,246
We'll never find my mom, will we?

983
01:37:05,452 --> 01:37:08,216
What do you mean?

984
01:37:08,289 --> 01:37:10,723
Of course we will!

985
01:37:10,791 --> 01:37:13,021
I didn't come all this way
to give up now.

986
01:37:15,963 --> 01:37:20,832
- At what time does she call you?
- 10:00 a. m. sharp.

987
01:37:20,901 --> 01:37:23,199
So we get up early and keep looking.

988
01:37:26,373 --> 01:37:28,671
- Before dawn?
- Sure.

989
01:37:30,344 --> 01:37:32,505
Now, go to sleep.

990
01:37:42,323 --> 01:37:45,190
I can't sit around any longer.

991
01:37:45,259 --> 01:37:47,386
It's been hours,
and she hasn't called.

992
01:37:49,430 --> 01:37:53,196
Paco,
can you check the bus schedule?

993
01:37:54,535 --> 01:37:56,469
Are you sure you want to leave?

994
01:37:56,537 --> 01:37:59,870
He's more likely to make it back
to Mexico than here.

995
01:38:01,242 --> 01:38:03,472
Fine.

996
01:38:32,773 --> 01:38:36,209
Paco, Carlitos is really smart.
He might make it.

997
01:38:36,277 --> 01:38:39,678
I don't think Rosario
is thinking things through.

998
01:38:43,717 --> 01:38:46,880
I'm not? I'm not, huh?

999
01:38:46,954 --> 01:38:51,914
Let's just suppose the I.N.S. got him
and sent him back to Mexico.

1000
01:38:51,992 --> 01:38:54,984
Who the hell is gonna take care of him
with my mother dead?

1001
01:38:56,597 --> 01:38:59,532
Or let's suppose that...

1002
01:38:59,600 --> 01:39:02,398
he got across the border
and made it here.

1003
01:39:03,404 --> 01:39:08,034
Where the hell is he gonna go?
He doesn't even have our address. Tell me.

1004
01:39:08,108 --> 01:39:12,067
Huh?

1005
01:39:12,146 --> 01:39:14,171
You're right. I'm sorry.

1006
01:39:20,821 --> 01:39:22,755
No, I'm sorry.

1007
01:39:28,495 --> 01:39:30,429
Forgive me.

1008
01:39:36,737 --> 01:39:38,671
I'll be leaving now.

1009
01:39:38,739 --> 01:39:41,572
I want you to have this.

1010
01:39:51,618 --> 01:39:53,848
I'll miss you.

1011
01:39:55,789 --> 01:39:58,519
I'll miss you too.

1012
01:40:06,900 --> 01:40:09,334
All passengers leaving for El Paso...

1013
01:40:09,403 --> 01:40:12,839
please proceed to Bus 21
for final boarding.

1014
01:42:51,165 --> 01:42:53,360
Hey, kid.
What are you doing here?

1015
01:43:05,846 --> 01:43:09,145
- Why don't you come with us, all right?
- No. I'm with my friend.

1016
01:43:11,785 --> 01:43:14,185
Is that your friend?

1017
01:43:23,964 --> 01:43:26,398
- All right, kid. Come on.
- No.

1018
01:43:26,466 --> 01:43:28,559
Let's go. Let's go.

1019
01:43:28,635 --> 01:43:31,160
Relax, kid. Let's go. Stop fighting.

1020
01:43:31,238 --> 01:43:33,638
Relax. Come on.

1021
01:43:39,146 --> 01:43:42,513
- Come on, now. Come on.
- No.

1022
01:43:42,583 --> 01:43:44,949
Come on.

1023
01:43:45,018 --> 01:43:48,476
Hey! Leave him alone!

1024
01:43:48,555 --> 01:43:51,752
- It's okay, kid. You're safe.
- Hey!

1025
01:43:51,825 --> 01:43:56,125
- Goddamn it! Don't move!
- Run!

1026
01:43:56,196 --> 01:43:58,494
- Bring him back this way.
- Get out of here! Run!

1027
01:43:59,866 --> 01:44:02,198
- Come here!
- Run!

1028
01:44:07,341 --> 01:44:09,502
Are you crazy?

1029
01:44:18,952 --> 01:44:24,447
- What about the kid?
- Let him go. We'll call it in.

1030
01:45:12,939 --> 01:45:14,930
Mama!

1031
01:45:27,254 --> 01:45:29,688
Mama!

1032
01:45:29,756 --> 01:45:33,749
- Mommy!
- Carlitos!

1033
01:45:42,169 --> 01:45:44,729
No, no. Don't cross!

1034
01:45:44,805 --> 01:45:46,773
- Mom!
- Carlitos!

1035
01:45:46,840 --> 01:45:48,774
Mom.

1036
01:45:48,842 --> 01:45:50,776
I'm here!

1037
01:46:11,998 --> 01:46:14,159
Sweetheart.

1038
01:47:14,528 --> 01:47:19,090
I'm not afraid of danger

1039
01:47:19,166 --> 01:47:23,569
A life without risk
isn't worth living

1040
01:47:24,571 --> 01:47:28,837
And when it comes to loved ones

1041
01:47:28,909 --> 01:47:33,710
You have to find the way

1042
01:47:34,981 --> 01:47:39,384
I won't give up

1043
01:47:39,453 --> 01:47:42,786
Until I have you close to me

1044
01:47:44,858 --> 01:47:47,292
For love

1045
01:47:47,360 --> 01:47:52,627
I can stop a bullet
with my chest

1046
01:47:53,700 --> 01:47:56,294
For love

1047
01:47:56,369 --> 01:48:01,068
I will cross against all odds

1048
01:48:02,476 --> 01:48:06,037
Love is what drives us

1049
01:48:06,112 --> 01:48:10,276
On earth and in heaven

1050
01:48:11,451 --> 01:48:16,150
And so for love I will cross

1051
01:48:17,157 --> 01:48:21,355
The border without fear#

1052
01:48:53,159 --> 01:48:56,686
#Tired, in pieces

1053
01:48:56,763 --> 01:49:00,392
Hurling compasses to the ground

1054
01:49:00,467 --> 01:49:04,164
A giant crosses the desert

1055
01:49:04,237 --> 01:49:07,764
Even if he does look small up close

1056
01:49:07,841 --> 01:49:11,504
He is wet, forbidden

1057
01:49:11,578 --> 01:49:15,207
His mother unaware of the adventure

1058
01:49:15,282 --> 01:49:18,877
The way is full of dangers

1059
01:49:18,952 --> 01:49:22,547
But distance has no cure

1060
01:49:22,622 --> 01:49:26,319
She would receive postcards

1061
01:49:26,393 --> 01:49:30,830
With orders to give her#

1062
01:49:30,897 --> 01:49:36,529
A million illegal kisses

1063
01:49:37,537 --> 01:49:41,132
He had a washed out hope

1064
01:49:41,207 --> 01:49:44,870
That one morning

1065
01:49:44,945 --> 01:49:48,176
Their two gazes would meet

1066
01:49:48,248 --> 01:49:52,014
Two gazes

1067
01:49:52,085 --> 01:49:58,024
Two undocumented gazes

1068
01:50:05,465 --> 01:50:09,492
Two gazes
