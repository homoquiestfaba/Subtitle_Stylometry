1
00:00:40,073 --> 00:00:42,676
What are you gonna do, kill me?

2
00:00:42,709 --> 00:00:45,845
You can't kill
either now, can you?

3
00:00:45,878 --> 00:00:48,280
Or yourself.

4
00:00:48,314 --> 00:00:52,118
What a terrible,
terrible conundrum.

5
00:02:04,322 --> 00:02:06,358
What news from the
mines, Harvard?

6
00:02:06,391 --> 00:02:07,993
It ain't
pretty, darling.

7
00:02:08,026 --> 00:02:10,429
We're gonna have to sell
something right quick then.

8
00:02:10,462 --> 00:02:12,364
Fargo's calling.

9
00:02:12,397 --> 00:02:15,300
We ain't gotta sell nothing
but Religion, sunshine.

10
00:02:15,334 --> 00:02:18,737
This town's gonna be bigger
than God's illegitimate son.

11
00:02:18,770 --> 00:02:20,305
How you reckon that?

12
00:02:20,338 --> 00:02:24,044
We gonna throw
ourselves a card game.

13
00:02:37,456 --> 00:02:38,858
More whiskey!

14
00:02:41,294 --> 00:02:42,362
This could get ugly.

15
00:02:42,395 --> 00:02:43,897
Not on account of us.

16
00:02:55,007 --> 00:02:56,742
Leave the bottle.

17
00:02:56,776 --> 00:02:58,111
Yes, sir.

18
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:02,915
You know those hombres?

19
00:03:02,949 --> 00:03:04,884
I've seen them cut down
ten men without taking

20
00:03:04,917 --> 00:03:07,219
their lips off of whiskey.

21
00:03:07,252 --> 00:03:09,221
That's why I
ain't involved.

22
00:03:44,289 --> 00:03:45,959
Pulp of whiskey.

23
00:04:06,412 --> 00:04:08,213
Hey, son.

24
00:04:08,247 --> 00:04:09,950
You're blocking our view.

25
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:14,220
Then move yourself.

26
00:04:20,293 --> 00:04:25,831
Mustn't value your life way
you's running that mouth'll.

27
00:04:25,865 --> 00:04:31,103
No, I just don't
value yours.

28
00:04:32,204 --> 00:04:34,974
Do you know who I am boy?

29
00:04:36,375 --> 00:04:39,846
A dead man, I reckon.

30
00:05:10,076 --> 00:05:15,182
Would you
settle their tab?

31
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:21,387
Why don't you play
something, piano man?

32
00:05:22,521 --> 00:05:24,824
God bless, John.

33
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:32,032
Raise.

34
00:05:35,134 --> 00:05:39,573
Color me cracked, but I
just might call that.

35
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:52,485
I'm sorry.

36
00:05:52,517 --> 00:05:54,987
I thought that was mine.

37
00:05:57,456 --> 00:06:00,060
Shall we complete the play?

38
00:06:02,161 --> 00:06:05,331
Look at all of these
distinguished gentlemen

39
00:06:05,363 --> 00:06:08,200
come to the party.

40
00:06:12,672 --> 00:06:16,142
A cognac, darling, and
whatever corn juice this

41
00:06:16,175 --> 00:06:20,013
Darwinian misstep imbibes.

42
00:06:21,547 --> 00:06:23,182
Read 'em and weep.

43
00:06:23,214 --> 00:06:26,118
Dear, dear, the
suicide king.

44
00:06:26,151 --> 00:06:29,021
And just when the
felicitous and fortunate

45
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:34,694
Salt Peter has the only card
that can bring about its demise.

46
00:06:34,726 --> 00:06:36,295
Gentlemen...

47
00:06:36,329 --> 00:06:38,997
Hey, you ain't
taking my money.

48
00:06:39,031 --> 00:06:41,634
But you can't
take it with you.

49
00:06:41,666 --> 00:06:44,003
This says I can.

50
00:06:44,704 --> 00:06:47,307
I'm not presently heeled.

51
00:06:47,339 --> 00:06:49,107
You're gonna die.

52
00:06:49,141 --> 00:06:51,944
You got something
smart to say about that?

53
00:07:04,156 --> 00:07:06,526
My valise, darling.

54
00:07:06,559 --> 00:07:07,928
Thank you.

55
00:07:08,661 --> 00:07:11,030
To you, my ace
in the hole.

56
00:07:11,062 --> 00:07:12,966
Thank you, sir.

57
00:07:14,266 --> 00:07:18,338
Mr. Salt Peter...

58
00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:19,972
Have you heard of this?

59
00:07:20,005 --> 00:07:22,607
What do we have here?

60
00:07:22,641 --> 00:07:26,312
A high stakes poker game
in Religion, Arizona.

61
00:07:26,345 --> 00:07:29,048
Why, that just
sounds divine.

62
00:07:54,206 --> 00:07:56,009
Hands up.

63
00:08:00,379 --> 00:08:02,115
Both hands.

64
00:08:09,321 --> 00:08:13,092
Should've stayed working on the
railroad instead of robbing 'em.

65
00:08:13,125 --> 00:08:15,661
You got two guns on you
now, and that poster says

66
00:08:15,694 --> 00:08:17,396
alive or dead.

67
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:20,165
Whichever I prefer.

68
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:24,370
Say your prayers,
Chinaman Dan.

69
00:08:24,403 --> 00:08:25,371
You first.

70
00:08:32,711 --> 00:08:34,614
Leave gun.

71
00:08:39,585 --> 00:08:41,454
Only one shot.

72
00:08:42,822 --> 00:08:44,456
Give bag.

73
00:08:45,825 --> 00:08:47,527
Drop belt.

74
00:08:51,864 --> 00:08:53,633
Don't kill me, mister.

75
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:57,237
I promise I won't say
nothing to nobody.

76
00:09:01,639 --> 00:09:04,410
Go away.

77
00:09:30,201 --> 00:09:31,703
This bloody country.

78
00:09:31,736 --> 00:09:33,472
It goes on forever.

79
00:09:33,505 --> 00:09:35,173
No sense to it all.

80
00:09:35,206 --> 00:09:37,275
I beg to differ.

81
00:09:37,308 --> 00:09:39,879
There's a freedom in
it's wild, open spaces.

82
00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:42,348
Freedom is an illusion
created by servants to

83
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:44,382
help them sleep at night.

84
00:09:44,416 --> 00:09:46,285
Illusion...

85
00:09:46,317 --> 00:09:48,420
Now you're speaking
my language.

86
00:09:52,390 --> 00:09:53,491
Impressive.

87
00:09:53,525 --> 00:09:56,328
Can you make my writing
assignment disappear as well?

88
00:09:56,361 --> 00:09:57,562
What story are
you covering?

89
00:09:57,596 --> 00:09:59,532
There's a poker
tournament in Religion.

90
00:09:59,565 --> 00:10:01,734
How providential.

91
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:04,737
I am one of its
participants.

92
00:10:04,769 --> 00:10:06,338
Edward James,
New York James.

93
00:10:06,371 --> 00:10:07,706
Raven McCabe.

94
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:10,342
Magician at large.

95
00:10:36,902 --> 00:10:39,339
Next time, pay the bill!

96
00:10:53,918 --> 00:10:54,754
What'll it be?

97
00:10:54,787 --> 00:10:56,322
Red wine.

98
00:11:00,259 --> 00:11:01,927
Jackeroo John, right?

99
00:11:01,961 --> 00:11:03,829
Saint John.

100
00:11:03,861 --> 00:11:06,865
Mighty biblical
for these parts.

101
00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:08,801
I'm a man of god now.

102
00:11:08,833 --> 00:11:11,236
That's not what I heard.

103
00:11:11,269 --> 00:11:13,273
Yeah, people change.

104
00:11:14,639 --> 00:11:16,641
The only change men make
around here is from the

105
00:11:16,674 --> 00:11:18,610
living to the dead.

106
00:11:34,659 --> 00:11:37,462
Drum up some business.

107
00:11:42,768 --> 00:11:44,704
-Bess!
-Hey!

108
00:11:47,639 --> 00:11:48,942
Sorry!

109
00:11:57,349 --> 00:11:58,850
Gimme some neck oil.

110
00:11:58,884 --> 00:12:01,254
You gotta stop endangering
my customers.

111
00:12:01,287 --> 00:12:02,888
Ever known me to miss?

112
00:12:02,921 --> 00:12:04,523
There's always
a first time.

113
00:12:04,556 --> 00:12:06,960
Not when I'm shooting.

114
00:12:16,769 --> 00:12:18,604
Takin' my leave
for a spell.

115
00:12:18,636 --> 00:12:19,938
Well, don't be gone long.

116
00:12:19,971 --> 00:12:22,507
You ain't my Pappy,
Southern Bill.

117
00:12:22,541 --> 00:12:25,378
As long as you owe back
rent on that hook house

118
00:12:25,410 --> 00:12:31,750
you're running under my
roof, I am your Pappy.

119
00:12:46,965 --> 00:12:48,901
Two whiskies.

120
00:12:48,933 --> 00:12:51,004
Extra thirsty are we?

121
00:12:52,337 --> 00:12:54,906
We don't do credit.

122
00:12:56,674 --> 00:13:01,713
Well, Southern Bill
at your service.

123
00:13:01,746 --> 00:13:04,549
Bed, booze, broads.

124
00:13:04,582 --> 00:13:06,785
I provide 'em all.

125
00:13:06,818 --> 00:13:09,421
I'm Waylin Smith.

126
00:13:12,390 --> 00:13:14,360
I got word of a card game.

127
00:13:14,393 --> 00:13:16,995
That's Harvard
Gold's affair.

128
00:13:17,028 --> 00:13:18,764
How do I enter?

129
00:13:18,797 --> 00:13:22,535
Go over at the Grand Hotel,
pay your fee, and sign up.

130
00:13:22,567 --> 00:13:25,670
I don't know how I let you
pluck me from my station.

131
00:13:25,703 --> 00:13:27,872
Sisters of Divine
Mercy.

132
00:13:27,905 --> 00:13:31,009
I broke up with God
for you, Harvard.

133
00:13:31,043 --> 00:13:33,913
He didn't build your
own town now, did he?

134
00:13:33,946 --> 00:13:35,548
Numbers don't lie.

135
00:13:35,581 --> 00:13:38,017
Religion can't afford the
gold prize staked on this

136
00:13:38,049 --> 00:13:40,919
foolish card game.

137
00:13:40,952 --> 00:13:43,688
It's hardly a mere card
game now, darling.

138
00:13:43,721 --> 00:13:45,725
Got a reporter from the
New York Times doing a

139
00:13:45,758 --> 00:13:47,360
major story about it.

140
00:13:47,393 --> 00:13:50,062
Well the folks a comin' better
enjoy spending money.

141
00:13:50,095 --> 00:13:52,764
Card players always
lavish their funds about.

142
00:13:52,798 --> 00:13:54,100
And what about
the gunfighters?

143
00:13:54,133 --> 00:13:56,134
They like their double
barreled discounts.

144
00:13:56,168 --> 00:13:58,471
I'll have myself
a new lawman.

145
00:13:58,504 --> 00:14:00,740
A Marshal from
Kansas City.

146
00:14:00,773 --> 00:14:02,007
Just one?

147
00:14:02,039 --> 00:14:03,608
That's all we can afford.

148
00:14:03,642 --> 00:14:05,845
What's he gonna do?

149
00:14:05,878 --> 00:14:08,648
Protect our money, honey.

150
00:14:25,096 --> 00:14:26,064
Whoa!

151
00:14:26,097 --> 00:14:27,899
You shouldn't sneak up
on folks in these parts.

152
00:14:27,932 --> 00:14:31,136
Accept my humble
apologies.

153
00:14:31,169 --> 00:14:32,937
I'm Bobby Shea.
Traveling carpenter.

154
00:14:32,971 --> 00:14:35,106
Bootstrap Bess.

155
00:14:35,139 --> 00:14:37,610
I don't shake hands.

156
00:14:37,643 --> 00:14:38,444
I saw you lookin'
at this plot.

157
00:14:38,476 --> 00:14:41,045
You fixin' to build
somethin' on it?

158
00:14:41,078 --> 00:14:42,847
My own hotel.

159
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,516
A respectable kind.

160
00:14:44,549 --> 00:14:46,451
For well-heeled
tourists and the like.

161
00:14:46,485 --> 00:14:50,022
Built the Gold Hill Hotel in
Virginia City, near on my own.

162
00:14:50,054 --> 00:14:52,657
What brings you
to Religion?

163
00:14:52,691 --> 00:14:55,694
Just looking for the
next town on the map.

164
00:14:55,726 --> 00:14:59,999
Aim to see the whole
wide world someday.

165
00:15:00,032 --> 00:15:03,668
Well I'll keep you in mind,
Shea, if'n I raise the funds.

166
00:15:03,701 --> 00:15:05,904
You got a plan
on that account?

167
00:15:05,937 --> 00:15:08,673
Gonna win the big
poker tournament.

168
00:15:13,578 --> 00:15:15,613
Mr. Salt Peter,
how are you, sir?

169
00:15:15,647 --> 00:15:16,982
Royal, my dear.

170
00:15:17,014 --> 00:15:19,818
I've traveled far and
wish to be installed.

171
00:15:19,851 --> 00:15:21,887
Will you be staying long?

172
00:15:24,056 --> 00:15:25,958
Not in this rabbit warren.

173
00:15:25,990 --> 00:15:27,793
I'm sorry, sir.

174
00:15:27,826 --> 00:15:34,834
Be forewarned, I like my
amenities and men that tease.

175
00:15:34,866 --> 00:15:38,803
The presidential suite is
available if you so desire, sir.

176
00:15:38,836 --> 00:15:42,140
Is it king sized?
Because my appetites are.

177
00:15:42,173 --> 00:15:43,608
Yes, it is, sir.

178
00:15:43,642 --> 00:15:46,979
You may follow our
bellman to your quarters.

179
00:15:49,914 --> 00:15:52,784
I like the
view already.

180
00:16:07,231 --> 00:16:10,702
Sorry, we don't
serve your kind.

181
00:16:20,245 --> 00:16:22,114
Serve him.

182
00:16:22,147 --> 00:16:24,617
What can I do for you?

183
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:30,956
Food, drink...

184
00:16:30,989 --> 00:16:32,992
Pretty lady.

185
00:16:33,024 --> 00:16:35,660
I can help you
with the first two.

186
00:16:38,797 --> 00:16:41,533
And I can provide
the third.

187
00:16:45,571 --> 00:16:49,008
You angry about
something, preacher?

188
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:51,710
Nothing you need
concern yourself with.

189
00:16:51,743 --> 00:16:53,679
Sources tell me you're a
genuine man of the people,

190
00:16:53,711 --> 00:16:55,047
Marshall Stone.

191
00:16:55,080 --> 00:17:02,555
I aim to please, and
my aim is pleasing.

192
00:17:02,587 --> 00:17:03,288
That it is.

193
00:17:03,322 --> 00:17:05,190
When there's call for it.

194
00:17:05,222 --> 00:17:08,259
We frown upon
violence in Religion.

195
00:17:08,292 --> 00:17:10,261
Unless it's
necessary, of course.

196
00:17:10,295 --> 00:17:12,197
You're gonna need some
deputies, Mr. Gold,

197
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:14,199
on account of the
influx of visitors.

198
00:17:14,231 --> 00:17:16,769
Yeah, as budget allows.

199
00:17:16,801 --> 00:17:20,972
There is one Zain Mohammed,
honest to God Arabian Prince.

200
00:17:40,826 --> 00:17:43,028
Certainly does
advertise his wealth.

201
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:44,696
Yes, he does.

202
00:17:45,297 --> 00:17:50,603
And that is how the stars
aligned to produce the

203
00:17:50,635 --> 00:17:54,973
handsome product
you find before you.

204
00:17:56,340 --> 00:18:00,612
I'm doing an article for
a prominent publication.

205
00:18:00,645 --> 00:18:02,146
Might be a book on it.

206
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:06,884
Well, I will allow you
thoroughly behind the scenes.

207
00:18:06,917 --> 00:18:09,687
For the good of the
story, of course.

208
00:18:09,721 --> 00:18:12,924
I am not a homosexual
Mr. Peter.

209
00:18:12,958 --> 00:18:14,893
Neither am I.

210
00:18:14,925 --> 00:18:16,260
Mr. James!

211
00:18:16,294 --> 00:18:18,663
Once again, a multitude
of thanks for lending

212
00:18:18,696 --> 00:18:20,832
Religion your
considerable talents.

213
00:18:20,865 --> 00:18:22,835
Well I am here
for the story.

214
00:18:22,867 --> 00:18:24,903
If the bank cheque clears.

215
00:18:24,935 --> 00:18:26,638
Meet my better
half, Roberta.

216
00:18:26,672 --> 00:18:28,240
Enchanted, Mr. James.

217
00:18:28,272 --> 00:18:31,876
We expect great
things from your pen.

218
00:18:32,810 --> 00:18:34,879
Well, I see you met Mr.
Peter, one of our more

219
00:18:34,913 --> 00:18:37,216
colorful participants.

220
00:18:37,249 --> 00:18:39,951
Yes, yes, indeed I have.

221
00:18:39,984 --> 00:18:42,420
He is in the room
opposite ours.

222
00:18:42,453 --> 00:18:45,390
Yes, I was thinking
perhaps the three of us

223
00:18:45,423 --> 00:18:48,793
could enjoy each other
the way the French do.

224
00:18:50,729 --> 00:18:52,331
Mr. Peter!

225
00:18:52,364 --> 00:18:55,233
You are so indulgent.

226
00:18:55,267 --> 00:19:00,139
Now, if you would be so kind
as to recommend me a Doctor.

227
00:19:00,172 --> 00:19:01,807
But, of course.

228
00:19:01,839 --> 00:19:03,041
Are you ill?

229
00:19:03,075 --> 00:19:06,011
Not quite yet.

230
00:19:06,978 --> 00:19:09,181
Well, we invite you both
to join us this evening

231
00:19:09,213 --> 00:19:12,350
for the declaration of
the tournament rules.

232
00:19:12,384 --> 00:19:14,886
And the Gold's
make the rules?

233
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:16,055
In this town, yes.

234
00:19:16,087 --> 00:19:17,923
We are the very
model of Capitalism.

235
00:19:17,955 --> 00:19:21,092
All we want is a clean,
fair game, gentlemen.

236
00:19:21,125 --> 00:19:22,894
A fair poker game.

237
00:19:22,928 --> 00:19:25,397
Well, that would
be a first.

238
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:28,299
Follow the Jack of Diamonds and
win your very own diamond.

239
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:30,169
Who will be the first
to test their luck and

240
00:19:30,201 --> 00:19:32,203
increase their
personal fortune?

241
00:19:38,375 --> 00:19:40,945
Make your
choice, good sir.

242
00:19:43,448 --> 00:19:45,685
Better luck next time.

243
00:19:50,221 --> 00:19:51,923
Game of chance?

244
00:19:51,957 --> 00:19:53,292
What's the stakes?

245
00:19:53,325 --> 00:19:55,728
Name it, my friend.
I'm a betting man.

246
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,495
I'll bet you don't see
morning if you try to palm

247
00:19:57,528 --> 00:19:59,964
that diamond off
as a real thing.

248
00:19:59,998 --> 00:20:02,234
I stand by my
production, sir.

249
00:20:02,267 --> 00:20:04,236
You do your trick then.

250
00:20:04,269 --> 00:20:05,904
It's two bits.

251
00:20:19,984 --> 00:20:23,788
I make my deals in blood,
cardsharp.

252
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:32,297
The cards stuck together.

253
00:20:32,329 --> 00:20:34,098
You dirty huckster.

254
00:20:34,132 --> 00:20:36,335
These are legitimate
games of chance.

255
00:20:36,367 --> 00:20:39,804
Do I have a game
of chance...

256
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:45,510
There's a Russian descent.

257
00:20:45,544 --> 00:20:47,346
Is there a dispute here?

258
00:20:47,378 --> 00:20:49,781
Not with the law, marshal.

259
00:20:51,849 --> 00:20:53,417
All firearms must be
turned in the sheriff's

260
00:20:53,451 --> 00:20:56,055
station at the start
of the tournament.

261
00:20:57,823 --> 00:20:58,891
Gentlemen, they'll be
announcing the rules in

262
00:20:58,923 --> 00:21:02,795
front of the saloon in about
a quarter of an hour.

263
00:21:02,827 --> 00:21:05,364
Lucky break, traveler.

264
00:21:11,603 --> 00:21:14,840
My fine good fellows and
esteemed womenfolk, I am

265
00:21:14,873 --> 00:21:17,241
please to declare the
first annual World Poker

266
00:21:17,275 --> 00:21:21,346
Tourney in the dynamic
city of Religion, Arizona.

267
00:21:21,378 --> 00:21:24,182
We are making
history here tonight!

268
00:21:27,551 --> 00:21:33,057
The prize is a pure gold cross,
worth a yearly salary

269
00:21:33,090 --> 00:21:34,592
of ten hardworking men.

270
00:21:34,625 --> 00:21:38,262
We will be adhering to the
rules of five card stud poker.

271
00:21:38,296 --> 00:21:41,600
You will each be issued
1,000 Religion poker chips.

272
00:21:41,633 --> 00:21:46,038
You may buy them back one time
on the first evening only.

273
00:21:46,070 --> 00:21:48,173
I will be the sole judge.

274
00:21:48,205 --> 00:21:52,610
And cheating in any fashion
will not be tolerated.

275
00:21:52,644 --> 00:21:56,848
I wish you all well, and
Religion welcomes you.

276
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:03,188
Who's thirsty?

277
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:20,172
Name?

278
00:22:20,204 --> 00:22:21,173
Don't matter.

279
00:22:21,205 --> 00:22:22,573
We all look same.

280
00:22:22,606 --> 00:22:24,309
True.

281
00:22:31,482 --> 00:22:32,951
Next.
Name.

282
00:22:32,983 --> 00:22:34,185
Bear Johnson.

283
00:22:34,219 --> 00:22:35,220
What do you want her for?

284
00:22:35,252 --> 00:22:37,021
Tournament rules.

285
00:22:39,057 --> 00:22:40,224
You'll get it back.

286
00:22:40,258 --> 00:22:41,894
I better.

287
00:22:41,926 --> 00:22:43,294
Bear Johnson.

288
00:22:43,327 --> 00:22:44,962
I heard him.

289
00:23:13,124 --> 00:23:15,294
What's the name
of your tailor?

290
00:23:15,326 --> 00:23:17,095
I'd like to pay
him a visit.

291
00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:21,433
Afterhours, of course.

292
00:23:21,465 --> 00:23:24,269
I do not wish to
speak of such things.

293
00:23:24,301 --> 00:23:26,471
Raise.

294
00:23:26,503 --> 00:23:32,410
If you wish to speak
of such things, call.

295
00:23:34,078 --> 00:23:36,981
An unfortunate
hand for you.

296
00:23:37,015 --> 00:23:40,285
Chen.

297
00:23:40,317 --> 00:23:44,355
Poker invented in China.

298
00:23:44,388 --> 00:23:46,090
Ladies and gentlemen,
we have a last minute

299
00:23:46,124 --> 00:23:49,560
entrant, who I only allowed
because he paid a penalty fee.

300
00:23:49,594 --> 00:23:52,197
This here is Bobby Shea,
the carpenter.

301
00:23:53,397 --> 00:23:54,732
Sorry I'm late.

302
00:23:54,766 --> 00:23:57,336
I was getting
fitted for a suit.

303
00:23:57,368 --> 00:23:59,971
You're throwing your
money away here, Bobby.

304
00:24:00,005 --> 00:24:02,374
Two hands are
better than one.

305
00:24:02,406 --> 00:24:07,078
Sometimes the best hand is
the one you don't play, son.

306
00:24:07,112 --> 00:24:09,081
Same to you.

307
00:24:12,616 --> 00:24:15,220
Off to a rollicking start.

308
00:24:15,252 --> 00:24:17,556
Quite the cast
of characters.

309
00:24:17,588 --> 00:24:18,456
And the setting?

310
00:24:18,490 --> 00:24:20,726
How do you find our
little metropolis?

311
00:24:20,759 --> 00:24:24,096
Very hospitable, but what
happens when the bullets

312
00:24:24,128 --> 00:24:25,496
start flying?

313
00:24:25,529 --> 00:24:28,299
Do you see any
firearms, Mr. James?

314
00:24:28,333 --> 00:24:30,435
Well, not in plain sight.

315
00:24:30,468 --> 00:24:33,605
Then we have ourselves
a peaceable proceeding.

316
00:24:33,637 --> 00:24:36,340
And when the big
guns start losing?

317
00:24:36,374 --> 00:24:38,175
Then they'll just have to
spend their money in the

318
00:24:38,209 --> 00:24:39,644
humble little township.

319
00:24:41,278 --> 00:24:42,713
Ever the optimist.

320
00:24:42,747 --> 00:24:45,150
I never was one to the
see the glass half empty

321
00:24:45,182 --> 00:24:46,585
or half full.

322
00:24:46,617 --> 00:24:53,057
But the owner of the glass
and the price of whiskey.

323
00:24:54,058 --> 00:24:56,595
I call your
trifling bet, fool.

324
00:24:56,627 --> 00:24:59,364
Fool is more powerful than
the king as he is not

325
00:24:59,396 --> 00:25:02,400
bound by the dictates
of the throne.

326
00:25:12,509 --> 00:25:15,212
The fool lives to
play another day.

327
00:25:15,246 --> 00:25:17,282
You got the guts
to play back, son?

328
00:25:17,315 --> 00:25:19,451
Or you think I'm bluffing?

329
00:25:19,483 --> 00:25:21,720
Don't lose your head.

330
00:25:24,788 --> 00:25:27,125
That's what I thought.

331
00:25:27,157 --> 00:25:29,560
It's a man's game, son.

332
00:25:29,594 --> 00:25:30,795
Last hand, competitors.

333
00:25:30,828 --> 00:25:33,764
Please bag your remaining chips
and leave them at the desk.

334
00:25:33,798 --> 00:25:36,667
Well, my American friend,
it is down to you and I,

335
00:25:36,701 --> 00:25:39,104
and I have more
chips than you.

336
00:25:39,136 --> 00:25:41,105
I'm Viennese.

337
00:25:41,138 --> 00:25:44,108
And you only have chips
because you bought 'em

338
00:25:44,142 --> 00:25:46,745
back after I
relieved you of them.

339
00:25:46,778 --> 00:25:51,115
It does not matter how one
begins, rather how one ends.

340
00:25:51,148 --> 00:25:52,850
Are you finished talking?

341
00:25:52,884 --> 00:25:55,120
Yes, Salt Pepper.

342
00:25:55,153 --> 00:25:57,722
It's Salt Peter.

343
00:26:00,625 --> 00:26:03,127
What a big hand.

344
00:26:04,729 --> 00:26:09,101
And all I have is
this little deuce.

345
00:26:10,701 --> 00:26:12,170
We're even my friend.

346
00:26:12,202 --> 00:26:15,106
The royal we as it were.

347
00:26:18,876 --> 00:26:20,644
Well...

348
00:26:20,678 --> 00:26:23,515
Look at your
little outfit.

349
00:26:23,548 --> 00:26:25,851
You think that's gonna
change anything?

350
00:26:25,884 --> 00:26:28,653
I answer to a
higher power now.

351
00:26:28,685 --> 00:26:31,655
You answer to me.

352
00:26:31,689 --> 00:26:34,558
What are you
gonna do, kill me?

353
00:26:34,592 --> 00:26:37,629
Well you can't kill me
either now, can you?

354
00:26:37,662 --> 00:26:40,499
Or yourself.

355
00:26:40,531 --> 00:26:44,403
What a terrible,
terrible conundrum.

356
00:26:47,605 --> 00:26:49,607
Competition has ceased
for the evening.

357
00:26:49,641 --> 00:26:51,509
Results will be
posted on the board.

358
00:26:51,542 --> 00:26:54,479
Now go out and enjoy
yourselves in Religion.

359
00:27:06,723 --> 00:27:10,227
How'd you end up in this god
forsaken town anyway, Mr. Shea?

360
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:12,864
I had a twin brother
named Tommy.

361
00:27:12,896 --> 00:27:16,601
He died in my arms
some time ago.

362
00:27:24,842 --> 00:27:27,946
Tommy?

363
00:27:27,979 --> 00:27:29,413
Tommy!

364
00:27:32,217 --> 00:27:35,487
Lost part of myself that
day I'll never get back.

365
00:27:36,721 --> 00:27:38,890
You after that rancher
that killed him?

366
00:27:38,923 --> 00:27:41,826
The law done got him.

367
00:27:41,858 --> 00:27:45,462
He got a life in prison to
think about what he done.

368
00:27:45,496 --> 00:27:49,301
And I got life outside
it to do the same.

369
00:27:53,637 --> 00:27:56,641
Waylin! Get your mother
behind the wagon.

370
00:28:06,750 --> 00:28:07,852
No!

371
00:28:07,884 --> 00:28:09,421
No!

372
00:28:10,989 --> 00:28:12,958
No!

373
00:28:14,625 --> 00:28:15,693
Why?

374
00:28:15,727 --> 00:28:17,963
Why?

375
00:28:20,798 --> 00:28:22,901
I am called Iron Wolf.

376
00:28:22,933 --> 00:28:27,271
Pale faced blood is poison,
but you are different.

377
00:28:27,305 --> 00:28:29,574
You have Apache
spirit in you.

378
00:28:29,606 --> 00:28:33,545
I will teach you to
live free on this land.

379
00:28:42,452 --> 00:28:46,724
Now our blood flows as one
and the great spirit will

380
00:28:46,758 --> 00:28:48,660
guide your actions.

381
00:28:48,692 --> 00:28:51,363
Drink this.

382
00:28:56,567 --> 00:28:58,903
I will teach you the ghost
dance and you will know

383
00:28:58,935 --> 00:29:02,340
your purpose in this world.

384
00:29:04,608 --> 00:29:10,314
I am your father now in
spirit as nature intended.

385
00:29:14,352 --> 00:29:15,387
Who's there?

386
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:17,355
I got the hot water that
you asked for, Mr. Smith.

387
00:29:17,387 --> 00:29:18,490
May I enter?

388
00:29:19,457 --> 00:29:21,326
You may.

389
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:31,303
How are you finding
the accommodations?

390
00:29:31,336 --> 00:29:32,871
Pleasing, thank you.

391
00:29:35,839 --> 00:29:38,644
Anything further
that you require?

392
00:29:43,448 --> 00:29:47,052
My eternal gratitude and a
fortune filled evening for you,

393
00:29:47,085 --> 00:29:49,821
my good doctor.

394
00:29:51,955 --> 00:29:54,558
Trust that your health
recovers at speed, sir.

395
00:29:54,592 --> 00:29:56,695
It always does.

396
00:29:57,994 --> 00:30:00,998
Well, what a
handsome sight.

397
00:30:01,031 --> 00:30:03,467
My fellow competitors.

398
00:30:04,499 --> 00:30:05,671
You may go.

399
00:30:08,105 --> 00:30:11,742
Now we have a
proper threesome.

400
00:30:11,776 --> 00:30:13,778
Your advances mean
nothing to me.

401
00:30:13,810 --> 00:30:16,013
Just getting to know
who I'm playing with.

402
00:30:16,047 --> 00:30:18,048
All part of the game.

403
00:30:18,082 --> 00:30:22,653
But only one of us could win,
unless there are side games.

404
00:30:22,686 --> 00:30:25,789
Which would be my pleasure
to host one in my suite as

405
00:30:25,823 --> 00:30:28,826
I'm not partial to
sleep at this hour.

406
00:30:28,859 --> 00:30:31,528
Count me in.

407
00:30:31,561 --> 00:30:33,897
Prince?

408
00:30:33,931 --> 00:30:36,934
You just gonna bat your eyes
or do you have the metal?

409
00:30:36,968 --> 00:30:38,737
More than you can imagine.

410
00:30:41,939 --> 00:30:42,941
You.

411
00:30:42,973 --> 00:30:44,576
I like 'em small.

412
00:30:44,608 --> 00:30:45,143
Come on!

413
00:30:45,175 --> 00:30:47,144
Hey!

414
00:30:47,178 --> 00:30:48,913
Leave her be, you jackal!

415
00:30:48,945 --> 00:30:50,848
Or what, woman?

416
00:30:53,116 --> 00:30:54,786
What the hell!

417
00:30:57,755 --> 00:31:00,926
Keep the pistol,
lose the dead weight.

418
00:31:02,527 --> 00:31:04,528
This is goodnight
then, Shea.

419
00:31:04,561 --> 00:31:07,097
It has been an honor
and a privilege, Bess.

420
00:31:07,131 --> 00:31:09,634
Don't get
sentimental on me.

421
00:31:09,666 --> 00:31:11,735
Tomorrow's just another
day you can lose it all.

422
00:31:11,769 --> 00:31:13,505
Or win it all.

423
00:31:17,875 --> 00:31:21,112
Around the world, my darling,
it could all be ours.

424
00:31:21,144 --> 00:31:24,081
If we play our
cards right.

425
00:31:24,115 --> 00:31:26,817
Get out of here, Shea.

426
00:31:34,491 --> 00:31:35,726
Saloon's closed.

427
00:31:35,759 --> 00:31:39,431
See Bootstrap if
you fancy a room.

428
00:31:40,530 --> 00:31:42,666
I'm not here for
the bed house.

429
00:31:45,569 --> 00:31:47,771
Due to lock up, partner.

430
00:31:47,805 --> 00:31:51,509
I'm not your
partner, bardog.

431
00:31:51,541 --> 00:31:55,112
Now fetch me some
coffin varnish.

432
00:31:56,480 --> 00:32:00,885
Don't you look black at me
and expect to see morning.

433
00:32:06,490 --> 00:32:09,027
Them irons meant to
be with the Marshal.

434
00:32:09,059 --> 00:32:11,096
Care to take 'em from me?

435
00:32:15,799 --> 00:32:17,534
Settle down.

436
00:32:17,567 --> 00:32:19,636
I get a little
balmy this hour.

437
00:32:19,670 --> 00:32:22,207
Perhaps this
will awaken you.

438
00:32:27,678 --> 00:32:30,248
Quite a tip.

439
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:33,551
I'll get you my best.

440
00:32:38,256 --> 00:32:40,592
What is that?

441
00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:42,193
Morphine.

442
00:32:43,961 --> 00:32:47,097
Under strict
doctor's orders.

443
00:32:47,131 --> 00:32:49,968
Fortunately, I
self-administer.

444
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,269
Are you ill?

445
00:32:51,301 --> 00:32:54,738
About once every four
to six hours, yes.

446
00:32:54,771 --> 00:32:55,972
Shall we play?

447
00:32:56,007 --> 00:33:01,078
Yes, I would prefer, my
friend, you not deal the cards.

448
00:33:01,112 --> 00:33:04,115
And whom do you suggest?

449
00:33:04,147 --> 00:33:08,552
I would be more comfortable
with the prince dealing.

450
00:33:08,586 --> 00:33:10,255
That is if you
would oblige us.

451
00:33:10,288 --> 00:33:12,155
That I will.

452
00:33:12,189 --> 00:33:14,926
As you like it gentlemen,
but be forewarned, I have

453
00:33:14,959 --> 00:33:17,961
a photographic memory.

454
00:33:17,994 --> 00:33:20,097
I don't miss a thing.

455
00:33:29,105 --> 00:33:32,777
If you do a thing,
many, many times,

456
00:33:32,809 --> 00:33:35,547
it becomes second nature.

457
00:33:36,681 --> 00:33:40,585
And when it matters most,
you will do it again.

458
00:33:40,617 --> 00:33:42,720
I can't tell what
matters most anymore.

459
00:33:42,752 --> 00:33:45,122
The great spirit
will show you.

460
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:47,959
When?

461
00:33:47,991 --> 00:33:50,561
When?

462
00:33:51,828 --> 00:33:54,031
When you don't
question the time.

463
00:34:04,174 --> 00:34:06,810
Who's the Injun?

464
00:34:09,646 --> 00:34:11,081
Who are you?

465
00:34:11,114 --> 00:34:13,217
Call me Saint John.

466
00:34:16,253 --> 00:34:18,189
Eagle Wing.

467
00:34:19,657 --> 00:34:21,992
What's your white name?

468
00:34:23,226 --> 00:34:25,029
Waylin Smith.

469
00:34:27,097 --> 00:34:29,601
You seem to have something
of a second sight.

470
00:34:29,634 --> 00:34:32,269
Well versed in the occult.

471
00:34:32,302 --> 00:34:35,172
Not by choice, was
thrust upon me.

472
00:34:35,206 --> 00:34:36,974
You mean spirits and such?

473
00:34:37,007 --> 00:34:39,977
Spirits, demons.

474
00:34:40,010 --> 00:34:42,213
You mean Anton Stice?

475
00:34:42,246 --> 00:34:43,748
That sorta demon?

476
00:34:43,780 --> 00:34:45,048
That's right.

477
00:34:45,081 --> 00:34:47,652
Right this way, Mr. Stice.

478
00:34:49,186 --> 00:34:50,956
Mr. James.

479
00:34:51,755 --> 00:34:53,357
Mr. James, rise and shine.

480
00:34:53,391 --> 00:34:55,626
New day in Religion.

481
00:34:58,862 --> 00:34:59,763
Mr. Edward James.

482
00:34:59,797 --> 00:35:01,865
Trust we have not
disturbed your repose.

483
00:35:01,898 --> 00:35:03,667
The truth is you have.

484
00:35:03,701 --> 00:35:05,802
Mr. Anton Stice, the
current leader of our

485
00:35:05,835 --> 00:35:07,938
little poker tournament,
has arrived for you.

486
00:35:07,972 --> 00:35:11,709
Heard you been penning an
article on the subject.

487
00:35:11,742 --> 00:35:14,245
Doing something
long form, as well.

488
00:35:14,277 --> 00:35:16,146
How novel.

489
00:35:16,179 --> 00:35:18,315
Well, you two will have
plenty to discuss then.

490
00:35:18,349 --> 00:35:21,385
If you'll kindly excuse
me, Religion calls.

491
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:27,992
I understand the power
of word, Mr. James.

492
00:35:28,025 --> 00:35:31,429
And it is you who will
write of these things.

493
00:35:31,461 --> 00:35:35,432
Yes, well, I suppose it is
up to me to immortalize

494
00:35:35,465 --> 00:35:38,001
the event as it were.

495
00:35:38,034 --> 00:35:40,871
Would you be so kind
as to invite me in?

496
00:35:40,905 --> 00:35:43,842
Yes, yes, please
do come in.

497
00:35:48,112 --> 00:35:49,180
Morning, Mr. Peter.

498
00:35:49,213 --> 00:35:50,314
Good morning.

499
00:35:50,347 --> 00:35:51,783
A package has arrived
for you, sir.

500
00:35:51,815 --> 00:35:53,784
Why, thank you.

501
00:35:54,719 --> 00:35:58,690
Thank you all for
your test of skills.

502
00:35:58,722 --> 00:36:01,226
Prince, your
breakfast is ready.

503
00:36:06,063 --> 00:36:08,066
Trust he didn't
clean you out.

504
00:36:08,099 --> 00:36:09,934
I let him win.

505
00:36:09,967 --> 00:36:11,135
Is that right?

506
00:36:11,168 --> 00:36:13,171
How much of my
money did you take?

507
00:36:13,204 --> 00:36:16,039
We broke even to the coin.

508
00:36:16,072 --> 00:36:19,009
I played you straight.

509
00:36:19,043 --> 00:36:22,113
The prince is a great shot
and a fine card player,

510
00:36:22,146 --> 00:36:25,850
but he's too proud
of his birthright.

511
00:36:27,751 --> 00:36:30,954
An Achilles heel in an
otherwise formidable foe.

512
00:36:30,987 --> 00:36:34,091
Why reveal this to a
fellow competitor?

513
00:36:36,226 --> 00:36:38,096
In the right
circumstances, I believe

514
00:36:38,128 --> 00:36:40,998
the shared victory is
the best stratagem.

515
00:36:41,030 --> 00:36:44,101
You're quite handy
with the cards.

516
00:36:44,135 --> 00:36:50,008
Perhaps we could work together,
share the winnings.

517
00:36:51,407 --> 00:36:53,344
Perhaps.

518
00:36:53,376 --> 00:36:55,980
I owe you some gold then
from tonight's game.

519
00:36:56,012 --> 00:36:57,848
We're even my friend.

520
00:36:57,882 --> 00:37:01,152
I miss nothing in the
matters of finance.

521
00:37:10,827 --> 00:37:14,065
Ever heard of alchemy?

522
00:37:14,097 --> 00:37:16,266
You switch the coins.

523
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:18,402
They switch themselves.

524
00:37:18,434 --> 00:37:23,074
At a level beyond where
the mere eye takes you.

525
00:37:23,106 --> 00:37:25,076
So you'd have me believe
you're an honest to god

526
00:37:25,108 --> 00:37:26,943
magician then?

527
00:37:26,976 --> 00:37:29,880
Do you believe in
honesty or god?

528
00:37:29,914 --> 00:37:31,115
No.

529
00:37:31,148 --> 00:37:34,985
Nobody believes in anything
nowadays except what they see.

530
00:37:35,018 --> 00:37:38,989
I believe in everything unseen,
that is my magic, Salt Peter.

531
00:37:39,824 --> 00:37:41,226
Hey.

532
00:37:42,193 --> 00:37:43,961
Look what I found.

533
00:37:46,130 --> 00:37:47,298
Where'd you get that?

534
00:37:47,331 --> 00:37:49,033
Guess.

535
00:37:49,065 --> 00:37:50,868
Scary guy?

536
00:37:51,501 --> 00:37:53,336
Must be worth a lot.

537
00:37:53,369 --> 00:37:55,205
We could run away with it.

538
00:37:55,239 --> 00:37:59,144
We already ran away, Sadie,
and we ended up here.

539
00:38:03,914 --> 00:38:06,150
You find yourself
a second place?

540
00:38:06,182 --> 00:38:08,418
One step from
where I aim to be.

541
00:38:08,452 --> 00:38:12,123
This Anton Stice, he's a
pretty serious competitor.

542
00:38:12,155 --> 00:38:14,192
It's just another man with
two legs and something

543
00:38:14,224 --> 00:38:16,027
dangling between them.

544
00:38:16,059 --> 00:38:17,195
Yeah.

545
00:38:17,228 --> 00:38:20,298
Well what I'm saying
is, be careful.

546
00:38:20,331 --> 00:38:24,302
After all these years,
I've grown tolerant of you.

547
00:38:24,335 --> 00:38:27,605
You getting soft on
me, Southern Bill?

548
00:38:27,637 --> 00:38:32,376
Gonna have my own hotel soon,
and you can come work for me.

549
00:38:34,277 --> 00:38:35,913
That'll be the day.

550
00:38:41,485 --> 00:38:44,454
Hey there,
preacher man.

551
00:38:44,487 --> 00:38:48,358
Can we help you find god?

552
00:38:48,391 --> 00:38:53,597
We accept donations,
too, just like church.

553
00:38:53,630 --> 00:38:56,067
Ain't nothing
for you here.

554
00:38:56,099 --> 00:38:57,868
Don't judge us.

555
00:38:58,902 --> 00:39:00,437
We's working girls.

556
00:39:01,338 --> 00:39:03,007
Go on.

557
00:39:10,547 --> 00:39:12,983
Can we talk a
moment, Saint John?

558
00:39:13,016 --> 00:39:15,919
I suppose.

559
00:39:15,952 --> 00:39:18,188
I know greed is one
of them deadly sins,

560
00:39:18,222 --> 00:39:21,325
but I can't avoid it.

561
00:39:21,358 --> 00:39:24,329
I wanna win
that gold cross.

562
00:39:25,461 --> 00:39:27,097
Why is that?

563
00:39:27,130 --> 00:39:29,567
For Bess.

564
00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:31,969
I love her.

565
00:39:32,001 --> 00:39:36,074
Then it's not the
cross you want, it's Bess.

566
00:39:37,507 --> 00:39:39,409
So when you do something
for someone else's gain,

567
00:39:39,443 --> 00:39:42,546
it ain't greed?

568
00:39:42,579 --> 00:39:45,416
It's greed either way, Bobby.

569
00:39:46,449 --> 00:39:49,252
I just wanted to
build her that hotel.

570
00:39:49,286 --> 00:39:52,956
Why's that?

571
00:39:52,989 --> 00:39:56,627
I saw how much her
heart wanted it.

572
00:40:01,465 --> 00:40:06,037
You know, Bobby, I think
you're the only one

573
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:08,573
playing this game for
the right reasons.

574
00:40:13,710 --> 00:40:15,545
-Name?
-Waylin Smith.

575
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:19,250
Come play.

576
00:40:19,282 --> 00:40:21,685
Not now, sweetie. Later.

577
00:40:25,588 --> 00:40:28,358
Can I have your
autograph, Mr. Smith?

578
00:40:28,391 --> 00:40:29,693
What for?

579
00:40:29,726 --> 00:40:31,596
You're famous.

580
00:40:33,097 --> 00:40:35,333
Sure thing, partner.

581
00:40:35,365 --> 00:40:36,567
Hey, what's your name?

582
00:40:36,599 --> 00:40:39,436
Dani Boyd.
I want you to win.

583
00:40:39,469 --> 00:40:42,138
Well, thank you, Danny.

584
00:40:42,172 --> 00:40:43,708
That's for you.

585
00:40:45,376 --> 00:40:48,346
Be careful of
your mortal ego.

586
00:40:48,378 --> 00:40:50,681
They hinder your spirit.

587
00:40:50,713 --> 00:40:55,619
Don't break me up in pieces
here, I'm just one person.

588
00:40:55,652 --> 00:40:57,554
Are you?

589
00:41:15,172 --> 00:41:16,474
Thank you, sir.

590
00:41:16,507 --> 00:41:19,309
Ladies and gentlemen,
introducing the traveling

591
00:41:19,342 --> 00:41:23,480
bare knuckle champion,
Mr. Roland Dunn.

592
00:41:23,514 --> 00:41:24,682
Yeah!

593
00:41:27,217 --> 00:41:31,355
And now, number one, undefeated
challenger, Sam Samson.

594
00:41:31,387 --> 00:41:32,355
Gentlemen...

595
00:41:32,389 --> 00:41:34,224
Show time, gentlemen.

596
00:41:37,226 --> 00:41:38,663
You like that?

597
00:41:40,530 --> 00:41:42,766
You want some more?

598
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:44,802
Here, you like that?

599
00:41:44,835 --> 00:41:46,103
You got nothing!

600
00:41:46,135 --> 00:41:47,204
Come on, hit him!

601
00:41:47,237 --> 00:41:47,637
Hit him!

602
00:41:47,670 --> 00:41:48,705
Come on, now.

603
00:41:54,110 --> 00:41:55,246
Yeah!

604
00:41:56,179 --> 00:41:58,515
We have a champion,
ladies and gentlemen!

605
00:41:58,548 --> 00:41:59,650
Roland!

606
00:41:59,682 --> 00:42:01,385
Knuckles!

607
00:42:01,418 --> 00:42:04,055
Day two will now commence.

608
00:42:04,088 --> 00:42:06,657
The hotel bar is stocked
with the finest of

609
00:42:06,690 --> 00:42:08,458
imported refreshments.

610
00:42:08,492 --> 00:42:14,331
So enjoy yourselves, one and
all, and let's play poker!

611
00:42:27,777 --> 00:42:32,682
Your eyes reveal the depths
of pain, Mr. Smith.

612
00:42:32,715 --> 00:42:35,819
I trust it's not because of
the hand you've been dealt.

613
00:42:35,853 --> 00:42:38,222
Trust has nothing
to do with it.

614
00:42:49,233 --> 00:42:51,535
Just want you gentlemen to know
you're playing for second place.

615
00:42:51,568 --> 00:42:53,704
I'm a flying high today.

616
00:42:58,608 --> 00:43:01,378
I am surrounded
by bearded men.

617
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:05,816
Could we call in
the town barber?

618
00:43:05,849 --> 00:43:08,152
I'd like to see
a gent's face.

619
00:43:08,184 --> 00:43:09,652
Quit your jaw
flapping, missy.

620
00:43:09,686 --> 00:43:11,521
I only quit when the
game is over and

621
00:43:11,554 --> 00:43:13,656
I'm declared the victor.

622
00:43:13,690 --> 00:43:20,798
The room was filled with
tension and anticipation.

623
00:43:22,865 --> 00:43:24,235
Be careful.

624
00:43:24,268 --> 00:43:27,371
This is not an
ordinary man.

625
00:43:27,403 --> 00:43:31,175
He has access to the
world between worlds.

626
00:43:31,208 --> 00:43:34,711
I cannot make my
appearance known to him.

627
00:43:34,744 --> 00:43:38,516
That man is energetically
bound to this one.

628
00:43:38,548 --> 00:43:40,284
He lives off
his life force.

629
00:43:48,759 --> 00:43:51,362
How you faring, Magus?

630
00:43:51,394 --> 00:43:53,197
Breaking even.

631
00:43:54,530 --> 00:43:56,199
No intermingling.

632
00:43:56,233 --> 00:43:58,802
You wanna live to see the next
round, you keep your mouth shut.

633
00:44:05,375 --> 00:44:11,148
A is for apple,
B is for boy,

634
00:44:12,583 --> 00:44:15,519
C is for captain
who says, ahoy!

635
00:44:15,552 --> 00:44:17,387
One more word and I
knock your teeth out.

636
00:44:17,420 --> 00:44:19,222
Should I handle this?

637
00:44:19,255 --> 00:44:21,357
A little drama's
good for the show.

638
00:44:21,391 --> 00:44:25,729
D is for deadly,
E is for end,

639
00:44:25,762 --> 00:44:28,733
F is for fortune
on which we depend.

640
00:44:31,702 --> 00:44:36,240
G is for gorgeous,
H is for haggard.

641
00:44:36,273 --> 00:44:39,809
I is for individuals
known to be braggers.

642
00:44:39,842 --> 00:44:44,248
J is for joker,
K is for king,

643
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:47,585
L is for lackeys that
hang by a string.

644
00:44:48,418 --> 00:44:51,922
M is for missed by a
whole country mile.

645
00:44:51,954 --> 00:44:56,293
That's two M's my friend
and one more if you smile.

646
00:45:04,434 --> 00:45:06,370
The rules clearly state that
violence against a fellow

647
00:45:06,402 --> 00:45:08,805
player will not be tolerated.

648
00:45:08,838 --> 00:45:11,708
Bear Johnson has been removed
from the tournament.

649
00:45:11,742 --> 00:45:16,214
After the break, we will
resume with our final tables.

650
00:45:21,418 --> 00:45:24,454
You're doing very
well, Waylin.

651
00:45:24,487 --> 00:45:26,856
Thank you, but I've
got a long way to go.

652
00:45:26,889 --> 00:45:30,793
The paper says your half
Indian, is that true?

653
00:45:30,827 --> 00:45:32,029
In a manner of speaking.

654
00:45:32,061 --> 00:45:34,632
What would be your
plans for any winnings?

655
00:45:34,664 --> 00:45:36,733
I intend to employ my
winnings to a number of

656
00:45:36,766 --> 00:45:39,302
charitable organizations.

657
00:45:39,335 --> 00:45:43,606
Connected to my non profit
corporation Stice United.

658
00:45:43,639 --> 00:45:45,509
Very commendable,
Mr. Stice.

659
00:45:45,541 --> 00:45:47,344
Very commendable.

660
00:45:47,376 --> 00:45:50,280
History is written by
the victors, old sport.

661
00:45:50,313 --> 00:45:52,616
I take it is.

662
00:45:55,985 --> 00:45:57,554
Still in it, I see, Bobby.

663
00:45:57,586 --> 00:45:58,922
Just barely.

664
00:45:58,954 --> 00:46:01,958
Made a few mistakes,
but I'm learning quick.

665
00:46:19,876 --> 00:46:21,512
Halt.

666
00:46:21,545 --> 00:46:25,715
Chinaman Dan,
AKA Daniel Chen.

667
00:46:25,748 --> 00:46:28,084
You're wanted by the law
for the federal crime of

668
00:46:28,117 --> 00:46:29,686
train robbery.

669
00:46:29,719 --> 00:46:35,992
I am here and now apprehending
you, dead or alive.

670
00:46:36,025 --> 00:46:38,594
A little blood.

671
00:46:38,628 --> 00:46:43,834
I don't believe
in your laws.

672
00:46:43,867 --> 00:46:48,706
Believe in this,
I never miss.

673
00:47:12,728 --> 00:47:13,931
Should we send a posse?

674
00:47:13,963 --> 00:47:16,432
This is a federal matter.
Clear the street.

675
00:47:16,465 --> 00:47:20,371
Ladies and gentlemen, legends
have been created in this town.

676
00:47:22,639 --> 00:47:27,544
I tell you, legends of the
wild west right here in

677
00:47:27,577 --> 00:47:31,649
Religion and you all have
the best seat in town.

678
00:47:34,050 --> 00:47:35,152
And I will sing.

679
00:47:35,184 --> 00:47:37,954
Yes, I will sing
praises to the lord.

680
00:47:37,987 --> 00:47:41,924
And with acceptance, we
can rejoice and he will

681
00:47:41,958 --> 00:47:44,128
offer us eternal life.

682
00:47:44,161 --> 00:47:47,030
To save us from
the fires of hell.

683
00:47:47,063 --> 00:47:52,603
The devil himself is in Religion
and no one can beat him.

684
00:47:52,635 --> 00:47:54,471
The magician?

685
00:47:54,503 --> 00:47:56,105
His tricks won't save him.

686
00:47:57,606 --> 00:47:59,610
Or the Ingun gunfighter.

687
00:47:59,643 --> 00:48:02,112
Too slow for the
prince of darkness.

688
00:48:02,144 --> 00:48:06,115
And what about the other
prince, the Arabian...

689
00:48:06,148 --> 00:48:10,887
All he's done is show
us his fancy clothes.

690
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:13,156
Fancy clothes, boy.

691
00:48:13,190 --> 00:48:15,858
I got my fancy clothes on.
I like...

692
00:48:15,891 --> 00:48:18,428
You mock me,
little fingers man?

693
00:48:18,461 --> 00:48:19,496
No, sir.

694
00:48:19,528 --> 00:48:21,431
I'm immortalizing
your character.

695
00:48:40,916 --> 00:48:42,485
Now, what have we here?

696
00:48:42,518 --> 00:48:46,155
I'm Zain Mohammed.
Prince of Asir.

697
00:48:46,188 --> 00:48:49,826
I could not help but note,
prince, that you are not

698
00:48:49,860 --> 00:48:51,894
in Asir at the moment.

699
00:48:51,927 --> 00:48:54,197
You are not half
the man that I am.

700
00:48:59,568 --> 00:49:01,838
I beg to differ.

701
00:49:01,871 --> 00:49:04,808
I challenge you to a duel.

702
00:49:08,911 --> 00:49:11,114
But the marshal
has our weapons.

703
00:49:24,561 --> 00:49:27,631
Religion's gonna be a major
metropolitan center someday,

704
00:49:27,664 --> 00:49:29,066
my darling.

705
00:49:29,099 --> 00:49:31,902
People will come far and
wide to see our little,

706
00:49:31,934 --> 00:49:34,036
my little flower
in the dessert.

707
00:49:34,070 --> 00:49:35,271
I believe it, Harvard.

708
00:49:35,304 --> 00:49:40,109
Once upon a midnight dreary,
will I pondered weak and weary.

709
00:49:40,143 --> 00:49:44,981
Over many a quaint and curious
volume of forgotten lore.

710
00:49:45,014 --> 00:49:46,817
This should
be intriguing.

711
00:49:46,849 --> 00:49:48,518
Indeed.

712
00:49:49,652 --> 00:49:51,821
One.

713
00:49:51,855 --> 00:49:52,755
Two.

714
00:49:52,789 --> 00:49:53,356
Looks like the odds
are shifting, Bobby.

715
00:49:53,389 --> 00:49:55,259
-Three.
-You wait here.

716
00:49:55,291 --> 00:49:57,927
Four.

717
00:49:57,960 --> 00:49:59,228
Five.

718
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:25,756
Your weapon, Mr. Stice.

719
00:50:28,090 --> 00:50:30,927
Wasn't mine to begin with?

720
00:50:34,264 --> 00:50:36,733
What sort of magic was that?

721
00:50:36,766 --> 00:50:38,902
Black.

722
00:50:38,934 --> 00:50:41,904
What color do you practice?

723
00:50:41,938 --> 00:50:44,007
Grey.

724
00:50:44,039 --> 00:50:47,143
Take the prince to
the doctor at once.

725
00:50:47,177 --> 00:50:48,979
Stice.

726
00:50:49,012 --> 00:50:50,814
It was a gentlemen's duel.

727
00:50:50,847 --> 00:50:52,983
The results
were not fatal.

728
00:50:53,016 --> 00:50:55,652
Zain Mohammad is
disqualified for producing

729
00:50:55,684 --> 00:50:57,920
weapons during the gaming.

730
00:50:57,954 --> 00:51:02,092
Anton Stice will
not be penalized.

731
00:51:06,028 --> 00:51:09,099
Is he a better shot
than you, Waylin?

732
00:51:09,132 --> 00:51:10,701
No, he ain't.

733
00:51:10,733 --> 00:51:13,570
Told you, mom!

734
00:51:14,871 --> 00:51:19,108
Your competitors are dropping
like flies, Mr. Gold.

735
00:51:19,141 --> 00:51:21,844
But you got your
story, yes, Mr. James?

736
00:51:22,846 --> 00:51:24,847
I have all that and more.

737
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:26,382
You will not be
disappointed.

738
00:51:26,416 --> 00:51:29,853
Well, then the players
are exchangeable.

739
00:51:29,885 --> 00:51:33,222
Some more exchangeable
than others it would seem.

740
00:51:33,255 --> 00:51:36,259
Such is life in Religion.

741
00:51:43,932 --> 00:51:47,070
Got work matters now, Bobby?

742
00:51:50,306 --> 00:51:51,807
Good work, girls.

743
00:51:51,840 --> 00:51:54,944
You are paving the way
to a brighter future.

744
00:51:54,978 --> 00:51:56,780
Hey, look what
I found, Bess.

745
00:51:59,682 --> 00:52:01,318
Who'd you pluck this
from, little Jill?

746
00:52:01,351 --> 00:52:05,823
That Anton fellow when he was
gabbing with the reporter man.

747
00:52:07,123 --> 00:52:08,191
You're a good
little witch.

748
00:52:08,224 --> 00:52:10,327
My favorite of the bunch.

749
00:52:10,360 --> 00:52:12,396
Now back to work girls and
steer clear of that Stice

750
00:52:12,429 --> 00:52:14,831
character unless you
hear different from me.

751
00:52:14,864 --> 00:52:16,634
Yes, ma'am.

752
00:52:18,001 --> 00:52:21,071
Tonight we will decide
which of our players are

753
00:52:21,103 --> 00:52:24,807
skilled enough to do
battle on the final table.

754
00:52:24,840 --> 00:52:26,777
Let the playing begin.

755
00:52:36,853 --> 00:52:41,023
So what's it gonna be,
carpenter?

756
00:52:41,056 --> 00:52:43,959
I think you're bluffing.

757
00:52:43,992 --> 00:52:46,396
Why don't you put your
money where your mouth is?

758
00:52:49,231 --> 00:52:50,668
I call.

759
00:53:00,143 --> 00:53:02,445
Can't keep a
good man down.

760
00:53:02,478 --> 00:53:05,114
Yes you can.

761
00:53:07,916 --> 00:53:10,788
You're just delaying
the inevitable, Shea.

762
00:53:18,293 --> 00:53:21,397
Feel the big pay day coming.

763
00:53:21,431 --> 00:53:22,532
All in.

764
00:53:22,565 --> 00:53:27,870
Bootstrap, such an
extravagant display of wealth.

765
00:53:27,903 --> 00:53:30,840
Prefer to watch you
roll about in it.

766
00:53:30,873 --> 00:53:32,909
Right behind you, Salt.

767
00:53:34,476 --> 00:53:36,913
I'm gonna call.

768
00:53:39,181 --> 00:53:41,250
I got you dead
to rights, missy.

769
00:53:41,284 --> 00:53:43,353
Name's Bootstrap.

770
00:53:43,385 --> 00:53:44,987
Deal the card.

771
00:53:46,523 --> 00:53:47,791
There she is.

772
00:53:47,824 --> 00:53:49,092
Why did you make that bet?

773
00:53:49,125 --> 00:53:52,094
You in cahoots
with the dealer?

774
00:53:52,128 --> 00:53:54,131
Get your hands off her.

775
00:53:54,998 --> 00:53:56,932
Well what are you
gonna do, little man?

776
00:54:21,423 --> 00:54:22,458
Yeah!

777
00:54:22,492 --> 00:54:25,896
That's what you get for
messing with Roland Dunn.

778
00:54:25,929 --> 00:54:28,331
A mouth full of fists
for dinner, boy.

779
00:54:35,304 --> 00:54:38,407
Hit him, Bobby.
Choke him out!

780
00:54:42,211 --> 00:54:44,280
Finish him!

781
00:54:57,092 --> 00:54:58,828
This man put hands
on our Bess.

782
00:54:58,862 --> 00:55:00,396
Toss him in jail!

783
00:55:00,429 --> 00:55:00,963
And Shea?

784
00:55:00,996 --> 00:55:02,898
He was protecting Bess.

785
00:55:02,931 --> 00:55:04,000
Is he still in
the tournament?

786
00:55:04,032 --> 00:55:06,036
Yes, yes he is.

787
00:55:10,072 --> 00:55:12,474
Ain't love grand?

788
00:55:12,507 --> 00:55:15,144
It can be, yes.

789
00:55:15,177 --> 00:55:17,446
You ever known it to last?

790
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:20,416
Hope spring's eternal.

791
00:55:20,449 --> 00:55:23,019
Delusion, as well.

792
00:55:30,360 --> 00:55:32,628
You're gonna win
this, Bessie.

793
00:55:32,661 --> 00:55:34,063
Yes, you are.

794
00:55:34,097 --> 00:55:36,032
Yes, you are, my girl.

795
00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:39,536
Go away. I'm indisposed.

796
00:55:39,568 --> 00:55:42,605
I know what you have in
there, and believe me,

797
00:55:42,639 --> 00:55:44,907
you don't want it.

798
00:55:45,942 --> 00:55:47,878
Come in.

799
00:55:51,947 --> 00:55:56,185
What are you
nosing about for?

800
00:55:56,219 --> 00:56:00,490
I'm a dead man, but you
needn't go down my road.

801
00:56:00,523 --> 00:56:04,494
Anton Stice, he's gonna
make you choose between

802
00:56:04,527 --> 00:56:09,432
your world desires and what love
you have left in your heart.

803
00:56:09,465 --> 00:56:10,901
How's he gonna do that?

804
00:56:10,934 --> 00:56:13,437
By giving you
what you want.

805
00:56:18,407 --> 00:56:20,676
Here, take it.
I don't want it no more.

806
00:56:20,710 --> 00:56:22,545
It's not mine to take.

807
00:56:23,646 --> 00:56:26,449
I just wanna live
a simple life.

808
00:56:26,481 --> 00:56:29,485
You can still do that.

809
00:56:29,518 --> 00:56:32,254
But I'll still aim to win.

810
00:56:32,288 --> 00:56:36,458
Man is a bundle of
contradictions.

811
00:56:36,492 --> 00:56:40,096
It's how he's so
easily defeated.

812
00:56:40,128 --> 00:56:42,965
In case you haven't
noticed, I ain't no man.

813
00:56:42,998 --> 00:56:45,968
But you hold a man's
fate in your hands.

814
00:56:46,001 --> 00:56:49,572
A man who's willing to
die for you if need be.

815
00:56:49,605 --> 00:56:52,442
Anton Stice is gonna visit
you tonight and I'm afraid

816
00:56:52,474 --> 00:56:56,211
that nothing I've said here
can prepare you for that.

817
00:57:01,083 --> 00:57:02,117
Bess.

818
00:57:02,150 --> 00:57:04,086
Bess, I know
you're in there.

819
00:57:19,202 --> 00:57:21,571
Innocence is
wasted on the innocent.

820
00:57:21,603 --> 00:57:23,406
Ain't that right, Bess?

821
00:57:29,277 --> 00:57:32,181
Good lord, you
gave me a fright.

822
00:57:32,215 --> 00:57:35,418
Not my intention.

823
00:57:35,451 --> 00:57:39,422
You don't strike me as the
card playing type, Saint John.

824
00:57:39,454 --> 00:57:43,759
I've done my fair share of
gambling unfortunately.

825
00:57:43,793 --> 00:57:45,762
So it's true what
they say then.

826
00:57:45,795 --> 00:57:48,431
That you once robbed banks
and left a trail of dead

827
00:57:48,463 --> 00:57:51,701
men in your wake.

828
00:57:51,733 --> 00:57:54,737
No, it ain't true
what they say.

829
00:57:54,771 --> 00:57:57,073
Well...

830
00:57:57,106 --> 00:57:58,976
It is a comfort.

831
00:57:59,742 --> 00:58:02,012
It's much worse.

832
00:58:08,317 --> 00:58:10,253
I ain't coming out.
I don't care what you say.

833
00:58:10,286 --> 00:58:12,289
I'll kill everybody in here.

834
00:58:14,123 --> 00:58:14,724
You shut up.

835
00:58:14,757 --> 00:58:16,291
You keep your mouth shut.

836
00:58:16,324 --> 00:58:18,761
I'll kill you,
I swear to god.

837
00:58:24,634 --> 00:58:27,503
Keep withdrawing the
neck tie committee.

838
00:58:28,838 --> 00:58:31,173
Who the hell are you?

839
00:58:31,206 --> 00:58:33,208
Those won't help you now.

840
00:58:33,242 --> 00:58:35,278
And you can?

841
00:58:35,311 --> 00:58:37,579
If you follow me.

842
00:58:37,612 --> 00:58:41,317
Where the hell am I
supposed to follow you to?

843
00:58:41,349 --> 00:58:43,185
The salvation.

844
00:58:55,364 --> 00:58:57,400
Evening, Mr. Smith.

845
00:58:58,634 --> 00:59:01,471
I see I scared
your Ingun off.

846
00:59:01,503 --> 00:59:04,173
What do you want Stice?

847
00:59:04,206 --> 00:59:06,108
I could ask the
same of you.

848
00:59:06,141 --> 00:59:08,110
Would you like
anything Mr. Stice?

849
00:59:08,143 --> 00:59:11,346
I'll have what
he's having.

850
00:59:11,380 --> 00:59:13,750
I hear you're
quite the shot.

851
00:59:15,885 --> 00:59:17,787
I do what needs doing.

852
00:59:17,820 --> 00:59:20,789
Well now we have
something in common.

853
00:59:20,822 --> 00:59:24,226
We ain't got nothing
in common, Stice.

854
00:59:24,260 --> 00:59:26,162
Except part in
a card game.

855
00:59:26,195 --> 00:59:31,068
That's enough
now, isn't it?

856
00:59:44,579 --> 00:59:47,784
Salt Peter!

857
00:59:47,817 --> 00:59:51,121
Care to join us?

858
00:59:51,153 --> 00:59:52,856
Not you.

859
00:59:52,889 --> 00:59:55,325
I didn't know you swung
that way, Miss Peter.

860
00:59:55,358 --> 00:59:58,628
Well, you know what
I always say...

861
01:00:02,264 --> 01:00:05,634
There's enough Salt
Peter for everyone.

862
01:00:14,376 --> 01:00:16,579
We have work to do,
my friend.

863
01:00:18,547 --> 01:00:21,316
Treating these folks
like some kind of gods.

864
01:00:21,349 --> 01:00:23,318
Ain't natural.

865
01:00:23,351 --> 01:00:27,222
A few days ago, they was
just a bunch of low lives.

866
01:00:32,295 --> 01:00:34,297
Interesting.

867
01:00:34,329 --> 01:00:36,565
As a fantasy.

868
01:00:36,599 --> 01:00:40,503
With a little alchemy,
it could be real.

869
01:00:40,536 --> 01:00:44,307
Dreams and reality
walk hand and hand.

870
01:00:45,208 --> 01:00:46,576
Indeed.

871
01:00:54,516 --> 01:00:55,784
Bill.

872
01:00:58,987 --> 01:01:01,625
What in the hell has
gotten into you two?

873
01:01:03,793 --> 01:01:06,461
This thieving scoundrel
stole my diamond.

874
01:01:06,494 --> 01:01:08,964
You wretched liar. It was
my diamond to begin with!

875
01:01:08,998 --> 01:01:10,233
Lock 'em up.

876
01:01:10,266 --> 01:01:11,267
And the diamond?

877
01:01:11,300 --> 01:01:12,602
That, too.

878
01:01:24,880 --> 01:01:28,684
I'm gonna fetch Mr. Gold,
and get to the bottom of this.

879
01:01:31,286 --> 01:01:32,989
Watch them.

880
01:01:33,021 --> 01:01:34,623
Yes, sir.

881
01:01:37,360 --> 01:01:39,329
Could you take
this for me?

882
01:01:39,362 --> 01:01:42,632
I fear this criminal
might steal it.

883
01:01:43,766 --> 01:01:46,302
What time is it?

884
01:01:48,603 --> 01:01:51,940
What is this?

885
01:01:51,974 --> 01:01:54,544
It isn't real.

886
01:01:54,577 --> 01:01:57,013
You're merely
dreaming all of this.

887
01:01:57,045 --> 01:01:59,815
Asleep right now on
a comfortable bed.

888
01:01:59,849 --> 01:02:02,018
On a comfortable bed.

889
01:02:02,050 --> 01:02:04,420
On a comfortable bed.

890
01:02:09,858 --> 01:02:11,793
Did you get those numbers?

891
01:02:11,827 --> 01:02:14,231
Like a photograph,
my friend.

892
01:02:15,498 --> 01:02:17,700
Those two are essential
components to our final table.

893
01:02:17,733 --> 01:02:19,836
They was at each other's
throats over stolen goods.

894
01:02:19,869 --> 01:02:22,338
We cannot afford to
lose them, marshal.

895
01:02:22,371 --> 01:02:24,574
I'm just doing my job.

896
01:02:28,311 --> 01:02:29,879
There he is.

897
01:02:29,911 --> 01:02:33,615
Ringmaster of the fine
circus called Religion.

898
01:02:33,648 --> 01:02:36,818
I heard you two had yourself
a disagreement this morning.

899
01:02:36,851 --> 01:02:39,922
Seems I have a similar
diamond to Mr. McCabe.

900
01:02:39,954 --> 01:02:43,793
If memory serves, I've
left it in Vienna.

901
01:02:43,826 --> 01:02:47,329
We've mutually apologized
and all is forgetten.

902
01:02:47,362 --> 01:02:48,530
Yeah.

903
01:02:52,534 --> 01:02:55,337
Must've consumed
a large supper.

904
01:02:56,639 --> 01:02:58,675
Liquid supper, perhaps.

905
01:03:00,608 --> 01:03:03,445
Well, case is solved then.

906
01:03:03,478 --> 01:03:05,581
Unlock 'em, marshal.

907
01:03:07,682 --> 01:03:09,751
If this was my town,
I'd have you hung.

908
01:03:09,784 --> 01:03:12,487
Well thank
goodness it's not.

909
01:03:12,521 --> 01:03:16,326
Anton Stice cannot be
harmed by ordinary means.

910
01:03:16,358 --> 01:03:18,327
I'll stay clear of him.

911
01:03:18,360 --> 01:03:21,364
But if he crosses me,
I've always got this.

912
01:03:22,530 --> 01:03:24,900
Can I see it?

913
01:03:24,934 --> 01:03:26,636
It's okay.

914
01:03:35,710 --> 01:03:37,980
It's a nice piece.

915
01:03:40,382 --> 01:03:42,085
Use it wisely.

916
01:03:46,121 --> 01:03:47,923
Hey, Saint John.

917
01:03:47,956 --> 01:03:49,826
Yeah?

918
01:03:49,858 --> 01:03:52,761
Let's keep this
amongst ourselves.

919
01:04:07,409 --> 01:04:08,810
Don't sneak up
on me, Bobby.

920
01:04:08,844 --> 01:04:11,614
I ain't sneaking,
Bess, I'm walking.

921
01:04:11,646 --> 01:04:14,416
It's how I get around.

922
01:04:16,619 --> 01:04:18,655
Still see it here,
how about you?

923
01:04:21,923 --> 01:04:22,692
Don't know.

924
01:04:22,724 --> 01:04:24,726
Maybe.

925
01:04:24,760 --> 01:04:27,028
That's not the
Bootstrap I know.

926
01:04:27,061 --> 01:04:29,398
Look, I got a one in
seven chance to win this.

927
01:04:29,431 --> 01:04:31,967
With you that
makes two in seven.

928
01:04:32,001 --> 01:04:34,836
That's not how
odds work, Bobby.

929
01:04:34,869 --> 01:04:37,406
We make our
own odds, Bess.

930
01:04:39,507 --> 01:04:42,177
This could be a
beautiful hotel.

931
01:04:42,210 --> 01:04:45,547
Just leave me be, Bobby.

932
01:04:53,021 --> 01:04:54,990
Ladies and gentlemen,
esteemed colleagues and

933
01:04:55,023 --> 01:04:58,094
members of the
international press.

934
01:04:58,126 --> 01:05:01,496
I'm proud to announce the
final table in Religion,

935
01:05:01,530 --> 01:05:04,700
Arizona's first official
world poker tournament.

936
01:05:07,702 --> 01:05:10,072
Our competitors, in
ascending order according

937
01:05:10,105 --> 01:05:11,940
to their positions.

938
01:05:11,974 --> 01:05:15,678
In seventh place, we have
the journeyman carpenter,

939
01:05:15,710 --> 01:05:16,745
Bobby Shea.

940
01:05:21,784 --> 01:05:24,586
In sixth place,
we have the reformed bank

941
01:05:24,619 --> 01:05:28,623
robber turned
preacher, Saint John.

942
01:05:28,657 --> 01:05:31,193
Nice hand, John.

943
01:05:31,226 --> 01:05:32,661
For us both.

944
01:05:32,695 --> 01:05:35,030
In fifth place, we have
the magic man himself,

945
01:05:35,063 --> 01:05:37,933
renowned illusionist,
Raven McCabe.

946
01:05:40,503 --> 01:05:43,873
In fourth place, we have
the half Ingun gunfighter,

947
01:05:43,905 --> 01:05:45,608
Waylin Smith.

948
01:05:45,641 --> 01:05:47,242
Where's your friend?

949
01:05:47,275 --> 01:05:49,945
Gone the way of the ghost?

950
01:05:51,213 --> 01:05:53,716
Every ghost was once
flesh and blood, Anton.

951
01:05:53,748 --> 01:05:54,983
Just like you and I.

952
01:05:55,016 --> 01:05:56,918
I thought we had
nothing in common.

953
01:05:56,952 --> 01:05:59,922
In third, we have the
most colorful dandified

954
01:05:59,954 --> 01:06:02,858
character to ever
step foot in Religion.

955
01:06:02,891 --> 01:06:05,560
By way of Vienna,
Salt Peter!

956
01:06:05,594 --> 01:06:06,662
Woo!

957
01:06:11,567 --> 01:06:13,869
The crowd
adores me and I them.

958
01:06:13,902 --> 01:06:16,805
You are addicted
to their praise.

959
01:06:16,838 --> 01:06:18,740
I embrace my
addictions, sir.

960
01:06:18,773 --> 01:06:21,009
They are my traveling
companions.

961
01:06:21,043 --> 01:06:24,180
In second place,
we have the formidable,

962
01:06:24,213 --> 01:06:28,551
but charitable cardsharp,
Anton Stice.

963
01:06:30,318 --> 01:06:33,188
And a charitable
applause as well.

964
01:06:33,222 --> 01:06:35,091
I haven't forgotten
about you yet.

965
01:06:35,123 --> 01:06:36,192
How could you?

966
01:06:36,224 --> 01:06:39,561
And finally, the fastest
draw God ever gave a woman,

967
01:06:39,594 --> 01:06:45,267
the madame to end all madames,
our very own Bootstrap Bess!

968
01:06:52,942 --> 01:06:55,043
How bad you want it?

969
01:06:55,077 --> 01:06:57,547
Bad as I need to.

970
01:08:21,796 --> 01:08:23,198
Check.

971
01:08:34,443 --> 01:08:36,045
All in.

972
01:08:47,922 --> 01:08:49,992
Call.

973
01:08:55,363 --> 01:08:56,932
I see that bet.

974
01:09:03,104 --> 01:09:04,906
I think I'll stick around.

975
01:09:26,161 --> 01:09:27,829
Call.

976
01:09:31,466 --> 01:09:33,201
Full dance card, gents.

977
01:09:44,113 --> 01:09:45,347
Raise.

978
01:09:53,855 --> 01:09:55,957
I can't tell what
matters most anymore.

979
01:09:55,990 --> 01:09:58,761
The Great Spirit
will show you.

980
01:09:58,793 --> 01:10:00,395
When?

981
01:10:00,429 --> 01:10:02,864
When you don't
question the time?

982
01:10:03,532 --> 01:10:06,002
Still with us, gunfire?

983
01:10:08,002 --> 01:10:09,137
Fold.

984
01:10:13,775 --> 01:10:15,144
Not this time.

985
01:10:16,377 --> 01:10:18,113
Was that to me?

986
01:10:20,882 --> 01:10:23,452
Guess I should call then.

987
01:10:24,920 --> 01:10:28,524
I do believe we will thin out
the pretenders with this hand.

988
01:10:37,466 --> 01:10:39,368
Call.

989
01:10:43,204 --> 01:10:46,876
We're gonna build us that hotel
if it's the last thing we do.

990
01:10:51,012 --> 01:10:52,113
All in.

991
01:11:12,600 --> 01:11:14,836
This has gotten
away from me.

992
01:11:16,204 --> 01:11:19,341
Victory always
comes at a cost.

993
01:11:22,344 --> 01:11:25,381
I turn this one over
to the fair lady.

994
01:11:36,225 --> 01:11:38,928
Back to the
wood shed, Shea.

995
01:11:44,032 --> 01:11:45,835
Take it away, Bobby.

996
01:11:52,474 --> 01:11:53,976
A fitting hand
before our break.

997
01:11:54,009 --> 01:11:56,011
Now one and all, please
enjoy the culinary

998
01:11:56,043 --> 01:11:58,881
comforts of Religion and
prepare to return for our

999
01:11:58,913 --> 01:11:59,881
final table.

1000
01:11:59,914 --> 01:12:03,385
We will crown our victor
on this very evening!

1001
01:12:04,920 --> 01:12:06,922
You can't win 'em all.

1002
01:12:06,954 --> 01:12:08,524
Don't go too far.

1003
01:12:08,556 --> 01:12:11,059
Don't intend to.

1004
01:12:11,092 --> 01:12:12,595
We need to talk, friend.

1005
01:12:12,627 --> 01:12:15,230
This game is
taking too long.

1006
01:12:15,264 --> 01:12:17,567
The doctor calls
presently.

1007
01:12:21,136 --> 01:12:23,606
Dear god.

1008
01:12:23,639 --> 01:12:28,577
If I believed in you,
you would feel like this.

1009
01:12:29,677 --> 01:12:33,181
What took you so long?

1010
01:12:33,215 --> 01:12:36,985
Gaze upon me.

1011
01:12:45,092 --> 01:12:47,896
Know
what you just saw?

1012
01:12:47,930 --> 01:12:50,332
Tuesday?

1013
01:12:50,364 --> 01:12:53,635
You cannot deny what is in
front of your own very eyes.

1014
01:12:53,668 --> 01:12:56,305
I'm not in the
business of denying.

1015
01:12:56,337 --> 01:12:58,373
Do you know who I am?

1016
01:12:58,407 --> 01:13:02,110
I know who you think you
are, but to Salt Peter,

1017
01:13:02,144 --> 01:13:04,947
you're no one
in particular.

1018
01:13:04,979 --> 01:13:07,282
But I deal in particulars.

1019
01:13:07,315 --> 01:13:10,985
I can't deliver until you,
my friend, the deepest of

1020
01:13:11,019 --> 01:13:14,056
all your mortal desires.

1021
01:13:14,088 --> 01:13:17,192
I already do
that on my own.

1022
01:13:17,225 --> 01:13:20,362
I can also
terminate your life.

1023
01:13:20,395 --> 01:13:24,333
That will also
happen without you.

1024
01:13:24,365 --> 01:13:28,436
You are a strange
sort, Mr. Peter.

1025
01:13:30,538 --> 01:13:34,076
I can see my work's
been done here.

1026
01:13:45,220 --> 01:13:46,088
Fresh?

1027
01:13:46,121 --> 01:13:47,690
Yeah, more or less.

1028
01:14:15,384 --> 01:14:16,685
Mr. Anton Stice.

1029
01:14:16,717 --> 01:14:18,287
They say he's the devil.

1030
01:14:18,319 --> 01:14:20,621
They say a lot of
things in Religion.

1031
01:14:20,654 --> 01:14:22,457
I believe it.

1032
01:14:36,037 --> 01:14:38,306
My, my, my.

1033
01:14:38,340 --> 01:14:42,677
Aren't you the most
angelic thing I ever did see?

1034
01:14:43,744 --> 01:14:45,547
Give me your hand.

1035
01:14:48,250 --> 01:14:49,551
Don't touch her.

1036
01:14:49,583 --> 01:14:52,755
Don't you ever,
ever defy me, woman.

1037
01:14:52,787 --> 01:14:55,056
Anton Stice!

1038
01:14:58,493 --> 01:15:00,730
Mr. Smith.

1039
01:15:03,431 --> 01:15:05,099
Get away from them.

1040
01:15:05,132 --> 01:15:07,301
Now.

1041
01:15:08,336 --> 01:15:10,105
Or what?

1042
01:15:10,137 --> 01:15:12,173
We'll send you
straight to hell.

1043
01:15:12,207 --> 01:15:14,510
And the drama continues.

1044
01:15:14,542 --> 01:15:17,311
Let's hope it
hastens the game.

1045
01:15:22,850 --> 01:15:27,022
Well I accept
your challenge.

1046
01:15:29,858 --> 01:15:31,260
That's a nice piece.

1047
01:15:31,292 --> 01:15:33,461
Use it wisely.

1048
01:15:33,494 --> 01:15:35,730
Whenever you're ready.

1049
01:15:35,764 --> 01:15:36,765
How about now?

1050
01:15:42,237 --> 01:15:45,173
Good god,
the odds of that!

1051
01:15:49,543 --> 01:15:51,145
Come on.

1052
01:15:51,179 --> 01:15:52,314
Come on.

1053
01:15:52,346 --> 01:15:54,050
Take your best shot.

1054
01:15:55,417 --> 01:15:58,654
You are unusually
courageous.

1055
01:15:58,686 --> 01:16:01,789
A man can die once
or a thousand times.

1056
01:16:01,823 --> 01:16:04,593
I see you've already
made your decision.

1057
01:16:06,328 --> 01:16:08,164
Now, marshal.

1058
01:16:10,798 --> 01:16:13,335
Gentlemen, this little
breach in our rules has

1059
01:16:13,368 --> 01:16:15,170
complicated our game.

1060
01:16:15,203 --> 01:16:16,772
And what hastens?

1061
01:16:16,805 --> 01:16:18,340
I'm withdrawing
from the tournament.

1062
01:16:18,372 --> 01:16:19,674
What for?

1063
01:16:24,378 --> 01:16:26,649
Another life.

1064
01:16:29,751 --> 01:16:30,752
Are you okay, Bess?

1065
01:16:30,784 --> 01:16:32,421
I'm okay, Bobby.

1066
01:16:35,289 --> 01:16:38,226
A heartwarming
twist of fate.

1067
01:16:38,260 --> 01:16:39,360
Indeed.

1068
01:16:40,729 --> 01:16:43,465
And what of Anton Stice?

1069
01:16:43,497 --> 01:16:45,567
He's still in play.

1070
01:16:45,600 --> 01:16:48,470
Some men make the rules
and some men break them.

1071
01:16:48,502 --> 01:16:51,206
The right ones
do, Mr. James.

1072
01:16:51,238 --> 01:16:57,445
Interesting how right and
might are so closely related.

1073
01:16:57,479 --> 01:17:01,150
Enough material
for your novel?

1074
01:17:01,182 --> 01:17:03,217
Very close, Miss Gold.

1075
01:17:03,251 --> 01:17:04,286
Very close.

1076
01:17:04,319 --> 01:17:06,221
Well do stick around.

1077
01:17:06,253 --> 01:17:09,692
Every great story
has a great ending.

1078
01:17:17,332 --> 01:17:20,836
Pity only one of us can win.

1079
01:17:20,868 --> 01:17:25,540
But that is the way of
the world now isn't it?

1080
01:17:25,573 --> 01:17:28,743
There are more worlds
than this one.

1081
01:17:31,680 --> 01:17:35,517
There are many things not
spoken of in polite company.

1082
01:17:35,550 --> 01:17:37,552
Right, Bess?

1083
01:17:37,586 --> 01:17:38,787
Play the hand.

1084
01:17:38,819 --> 01:17:41,222
We ain't here to
talk this out.

1085
01:17:41,922 --> 01:17:45,460
Let's let the cards decide
who is worthy of the victory.

1086
01:17:45,493 --> 01:17:49,631
Your fates hang on a
mere game of chance.

1087
01:17:49,663 --> 01:17:52,266
My kind of odds.

1088
01:17:56,337 --> 01:17:57,639
Who do you reckon wins?

1089
01:17:57,671 --> 01:17:59,473
Religion wins, Bill.

1090
01:17:59,506 --> 01:18:01,844
That was always
the outcome.

1091
01:18:12,520 --> 01:18:14,423
Well, well.

1092
01:18:14,456 --> 01:18:17,560
We find ourselves at
the witching hour.

1093
01:18:19,360 --> 01:18:22,430
Time to see what
you are all made of.

1094
01:18:36,278 --> 01:18:37,878
Check.

1095
01:18:40,314 --> 01:18:43,284
Interesting.

1096
01:18:43,318 --> 01:18:45,787
I think you
dropped something.

1097
01:19:06,608 --> 01:19:09,878
Some dreams were
never meant to be.

1098
01:19:27,895 --> 01:19:30,298
I raise. All in.

1099
01:19:37,005 --> 01:19:40,074
Odds are two in
five, right Bobby?

1100
01:19:40,108 --> 01:19:42,444
That's right.

1101
01:19:43,345 --> 01:19:45,314
Wasted on the innocent.

1102
01:19:45,346 --> 01:19:47,750
Right Bess?

1103
01:19:52,453 --> 01:19:54,989
All in.

1104
01:19:56,557 --> 01:20:00,362
I see you remember what
game you're playing.

1105
01:20:00,395 --> 01:20:02,965
I know what I'm doing.

1106
01:20:07,836 --> 01:20:12,408
This is what I live for.

1107
01:20:18,113 --> 01:20:21,717
Well it looks like we got
ourselves a showdown.

1108
01:20:29,657 --> 01:20:31,793
Let the cards decide.

1109
01:20:37,164 --> 01:20:39,967
The moment of
truth is upon us.

1110
01:21:02,791 --> 01:21:04,893
Must
be my lucky day.

1111
01:21:09,130 --> 01:21:11,699
In cahoots, I see?

1112
01:21:12,766 --> 01:21:14,670
You know the game well.

1113
01:21:27,748 --> 01:21:29,484
This is goodnight then.

1114
01:21:36,490 --> 01:21:37,292
Well.

1115
01:21:37,324 --> 01:21:40,761
A marvelous and
enchanting occasion.

1116
01:21:40,795 --> 01:21:43,931
I thank you all
for amusing me.

1117
01:21:55,810 --> 01:21:58,680
Drink that. It will
help with that cough.

1118
01:22:00,715 --> 01:22:03,085
Got ourselves an
even playing field.

1119
01:22:04,853 --> 01:22:08,523
You can't win
unless I let you.

1120
01:22:08,555 --> 01:22:11,826
And why would you do that?

1121
01:22:11,859 --> 01:22:14,896
Let's go in the alley.
We'll talk.

1122
01:22:16,029 --> 01:22:17,798
Careful, Bobby.

1123
01:22:17,832 --> 01:22:19,635
I know what I'm doing.

1124
01:22:35,216 --> 01:22:37,185
Mr. Shea.

1125
01:22:37,217 --> 01:22:40,622
I have an offer to make.

1126
01:22:40,654 --> 01:22:42,823
One time only deal.

1127
01:22:42,856 --> 01:22:45,560
If you accept it, all your
worldly desires will be

1128
01:22:45,592 --> 01:22:47,996
realized in this lifetime.

1129
01:22:48,029 --> 01:22:50,198
Riches and power.

1130
01:22:50,230 --> 01:22:54,902
The ability to bend the world
to your masculine will.

1131
01:22:54,935 --> 01:22:58,239
You can't promise
those things, Stice.

1132
01:22:58,273 --> 01:22:59,608
No man can.

1133
01:22:59,640 --> 01:23:01,675
I'm not a man, Shea.

1134
01:23:01,708 --> 01:23:03,144
I never was.

1135
01:23:03,176 --> 01:23:04,845
Who are you?

1136
01:23:04,878 --> 01:23:06,280
I'm sure you've heard the
stories from as far back

1137
01:23:06,314 --> 01:23:08,115
as your childhood.

1138
01:23:08,149 --> 01:23:10,285
Can't expect me
to believe that.

1139
01:23:10,318 --> 01:23:13,889
You believe in
god, don't you?

1140
01:23:13,921 --> 01:23:14,855
Yes.

1141
01:23:14,889 --> 01:23:16,757
Then why not me.

1142
01:23:16,791 --> 01:23:21,063
I believe you're a hustler
who is good with a gun.

1143
01:23:23,597 --> 01:23:26,167
Look into my eyes.

1144
01:23:30,805 --> 01:23:34,076
We will play til we have a
winner or we reach dawn.

1145
01:23:35,643 --> 01:23:37,045
Can't be.

1146
01:23:38,645 --> 01:23:42,182
The devil?

1147
01:23:42,216 --> 01:23:44,185
Here in Religion?

1148
01:23:44,217 --> 01:23:46,320
Is there a better
place to be?

1149
01:23:46,354 --> 01:23:49,658
Think of me as your
corporal ally.

1150
01:23:49,690 --> 01:23:52,226
Pulling the world's
strings in your favor.

1151
01:23:52,260 --> 01:23:54,663
In return for what?

1152
01:23:54,695 --> 01:23:57,097
Nothing you wouldn't
miss in this lifetime.

1153
01:23:57,131 --> 01:23:59,634
You tried to make this deal
with Bess, didn't you?

1154
01:23:59,667 --> 01:24:02,304
Bess is her own worst
enemy because she needs

1155
01:24:02,337 --> 01:24:06,641
a man like you to lead
her to her salvation.

1156
01:24:06,673 --> 01:24:08,109
I can do that on my own.

1157
01:24:08,141 --> 01:24:10,010
Can you?

1158
01:24:10,043 --> 01:24:11,912
A destitute carpenter?

1159
01:24:11,945 --> 01:24:15,182
One job removed
from the poorhouse?

1160
01:24:18,185 --> 01:24:21,989
I have made kings
out of paupers.

1161
01:24:22,023 --> 01:24:24,993
Gods of mere men.

1162
01:24:25,025 --> 01:24:28,363
Men can't interfere
with the will of god.

1163
01:24:28,395 --> 01:24:30,230
You wanna talk about will?

1164
01:24:30,264 --> 01:24:32,100
Well this is my will.

1165
01:24:32,132 --> 01:24:36,871
You take the cross,
you go get that hotel.

1166
01:24:36,904 --> 01:24:38,974
What if I don't take it?

1167
01:24:39,006 --> 01:24:42,610
Then I return in one month's
time and will bury you

1168
01:24:42,644 --> 01:24:45,079
with your brother.

1169
01:24:45,113 --> 01:24:47,215
And Bess.

1170
01:24:56,724 --> 01:24:59,127
We will play til we have a
winner or we reach dawn.

1171
01:24:59,159 --> 01:25:01,261
Whichever comes first.

1172
01:25:01,295 --> 01:25:05,233
When the cock crows, if we
do not have a victor,

1173
01:25:05,265 --> 01:25:09,303
we will play one final
hand for the gold prize.

1174
01:25:14,708 --> 01:25:17,979
All comes down to
this, Bobby Shea.

1175
01:25:18,011 --> 01:25:21,616
You have the power
to save two lives.

1176
01:25:22,315 --> 01:25:25,119
Deal me in.

1177
01:25:36,296 --> 01:25:42,403
Nothing like gold to bring
a man to his knees.

1178
01:25:47,140 --> 01:25:48,442
Last hand, gentlemen.

1179
01:25:48,475 --> 01:25:50,844
To the victor goes
the gold cross.

1180
01:25:50,877 --> 01:25:53,681
Highest chip stack wins.

1181
01:26:08,462 --> 01:26:10,164
Check.

1182
01:26:11,164 --> 01:26:12,667
I raise.

1183
01:26:16,136 --> 01:26:17,237
I call.

1184
01:26:37,324 --> 01:26:39,327
I raise.

1185
01:26:40,795 --> 01:26:41,829
Call.

1186
01:27:06,052 --> 01:27:07,521
I raise.

1187
01:27:07,555 --> 01:27:10,425
No point in turning
back now, Shea.

1188
01:27:10,457 --> 01:27:13,094
A betting's just
a formality.

1189
01:27:14,561 --> 01:27:15,497
Call.

1190
01:27:19,533 --> 01:27:23,438
Just one card away now.

1191
01:27:23,470 --> 01:27:25,139
Remember Bess.

1192
01:27:45,091 --> 01:27:46,327
Raise.

1193
01:28:16,289 --> 01:28:17,958
Got nothing.

1194
01:28:49,489 --> 01:28:53,161
I was told not to sneak up
on folks in these parts.

1195
01:28:54,561 --> 01:28:57,532
Love don't sneak, Bobby.

1196
01:28:57,564 --> 01:29:01,869
Disappears when you
least expect it.

1197
01:29:07,108 --> 01:29:10,078
We came so close.

1198
01:29:11,578 --> 01:29:14,916
But at what cost?

1199
01:29:18,118 --> 01:29:20,554
Don't seem possible
what happened.

1200
01:29:20,587 --> 01:29:23,423
Do you think he's
really who he says?

1201
01:29:23,457 --> 01:29:25,360
Think we are?

1202
01:29:27,094 --> 01:29:30,064
When all is said and done,
this whole world and all

1203
01:29:30,096 --> 01:29:34,268
that's in it is just
some kind of spell.

1204
01:29:34,301 --> 01:29:37,070
Who's spell?

1205
01:29:37,104 --> 01:29:41,076
Could be ours,
if we choose it.

1206
01:29:47,414 --> 01:29:52,119
We should just enjoy our
time here while we have it.

1207
01:29:57,958 --> 01:30:02,898
If we're together, Bobby,
we don't need the money.

1208
01:30:05,265 --> 01:30:07,601
I answer to a
higher power now.

1209
01:30:07,635 --> 01:30:08,970
You answer to me.

1210
01:30:09,002 --> 01:30:11,438
What are you
gonna do, kill me?

1211
01:30:11,471 --> 01:30:14,608
Well, you can't kill
either now, can you?

1212
01:30:14,641 --> 01:30:17,377
Or yourself.

1213
01:30:17,411 --> 01:30:19,480
Please, make room
for Mr. Stice.

1214
01:30:19,512 --> 01:30:21,448
He's had a long
day and night.

1215
01:30:21,481 --> 01:30:23,051
And remember, tell folks
about the fine town of

1216
01:30:23,083 --> 01:30:24,484
Religion when
you get home.

1217
01:30:24,518 --> 01:30:27,488
About that book
deal, Mr. Stice.

1218
01:30:27,520 --> 01:30:31,192
Don't you worry, Mr.
James, you'll get all

1219
01:30:31,225 --> 01:30:34,128
that's coming to you.

1220
01:30:34,161 --> 01:30:35,663
I thank you, sir.

1221
01:30:35,695 --> 01:30:38,131
I thank you for
all your help.

1222
01:30:38,164 --> 01:30:40,702
There will be time
to thank me later.

1223
01:30:40,734 --> 01:30:44,139
Now if you will excuse me.

1224
01:31:00,387 --> 01:31:04,024
You're not gonna need
that where you're going.

1225
01:31:12,699 --> 01:31:16,104
You lost this time, Anton.

1226
01:31:16,136 --> 01:31:19,539
The carpenter didn't
take your deal.

1227
01:31:19,573 --> 01:31:24,512
But this is where
things get interesting.

1228
01:31:24,545 --> 01:31:26,614
The tournament's finished.

1229
01:31:26,646 --> 01:31:30,350
I think it's best we just
leave Religion behind.

1230
01:31:30,384 --> 01:31:35,355
I have one more hand
for you, Saint John.

1231
01:31:35,389 --> 01:31:38,458
There ain't no more
hands left to play.

1232
01:31:38,492 --> 01:31:41,029
No?

1233
01:31:41,061 --> 01:31:44,631
How would you like your
immortal soul back?

1234
01:31:44,664 --> 01:31:49,170
That is what you most
desire now, isn't it?

1235
01:31:54,641 --> 01:31:57,278
What are you proposing?

1236
01:31:57,310 --> 01:32:01,615
You'll bring Shea to me in
exchange for the return of

1237
01:32:01,649 --> 01:32:04,152
your soul.

1238
01:32:04,185 --> 01:32:06,454
And a gold cross to boot.

1239
01:32:06,487 --> 01:32:13,728
To start a new life
with as a man of means.

1240
01:32:13,761 --> 01:32:16,531
Shea already
turned you down.

1241
01:32:16,564 --> 01:32:19,768
You will convince
him otherwise.

1242
01:32:44,625 --> 01:32:47,161
Will I ever see you again,
Salt Peter?

1243
01:32:47,194 --> 01:32:49,497
Probably not.

1244
01:32:56,203 --> 01:32:58,173
But you never know.

1245
01:32:59,806 --> 01:33:01,509
Let's go!

1246
01:33:02,609 --> 01:33:04,378
There goes Salt Peter.

1247
01:33:05,746 --> 01:33:09,150
Religion won't see the likes
of him in this town again.

1248
01:33:09,783 --> 01:33:12,420
Excuse me, Bess.

1249
01:33:12,453 --> 01:33:14,555
Where you going?

1250
01:33:14,587 --> 01:33:16,523
My stomach's bothering me.

1251
01:33:16,556 --> 01:33:18,492
I got something for that.

1252
01:33:18,525 --> 01:33:21,162
Just give me a minute.

1253
01:33:23,596 --> 01:33:26,533
I, for one, am
glad he's going.

1254
01:33:26,567 --> 01:33:28,769
I second that, darling.

1255
01:33:40,247 --> 01:33:43,751
You wish to save Bess?

1256
01:33:43,783 --> 01:33:46,453
I'll give anything.

1257
01:33:49,856 --> 01:33:51,859
Will you?

1258
01:33:59,966 --> 01:34:02,670
I'm ready to go with you.

1259
01:34:02,703 --> 01:34:05,540
You chose wisely, Shea.

1260
01:34:05,573 --> 01:34:08,676
Bess will not be harmed.

1261
01:34:08,708 --> 01:34:11,378
And you will give
your soul to me.

1262
01:34:11,412 --> 01:34:13,447
What do I have to do?

1263
01:34:13,479 --> 01:34:16,517
You step forward.

1264
01:34:17,551 --> 01:34:19,187
You're not gonna
kill me, are you?

1265
01:34:19,220 --> 01:34:21,722
Nothing of the
sort, my boy.

1266
01:34:23,256 --> 01:34:25,559
I will lose my sixes.

1267
01:34:29,963 --> 01:34:32,399
Now come to me.

1268
01:34:35,636 --> 01:34:38,706
Couldn't stand to
miss the last hand.

1269
01:34:38,738 --> 01:34:40,740
Salt Peter.

1270
01:34:40,774 --> 01:34:43,311
How amusing.

1271
01:34:43,344 --> 01:34:46,713
The self-serving hedonist
arrived to save the day.

1272
01:34:46,747 --> 01:34:49,550
Indeed.

1273
01:34:49,582 --> 01:34:54,988
And I will take his life before
I let you take his soul.

1274
01:34:55,021 --> 01:34:57,490
And what's in it for you?

1275
01:34:57,524 --> 01:34:59,660
Because we both know there's
always a little something.

1276
01:34:59,693 --> 01:35:04,765
Just the delightful pleasure
of seeing you lose, Stice,

1277
01:35:04,797 --> 01:35:08,235
and knowing I had a
hand in the trick.

1278
01:35:08,269 --> 01:35:11,439
I could shoot you in between the
eyes before you even blink.

1279
01:35:11,471 --> 01:35:14,608
But you've
lost your sixes.

1280
01:35:14,641 --> 01:35:19,279
Come now, what's your
price, mercenary?

1281
01:35:19,313 --> 01:35:22,984
You have nothing
to offer me.

1282
01:35:24,752 --> 01:35:27,589
Isn't this what you
were playing for?

1283
01:35:32,826 --> 01:35:36,863
Now you pick it up, you walk
away, and you have my word.

1284
01:35:36,896 --> 01:35:39,500
I will not harm you.

1285
01:35:39,533 --> 01:35:41,469
It's made of tin.

1286
01:35:42,970 --> 01:35:46,807
It's too late for
your petty games.

1287
01:35:50,743 --> 01:35:52,846
Gaze upon it.

1288
01:35:56,649 --> 01:35:59,886
That foul magician.

1289
01:36:01,521 --> 01:36:02,823
McCabe.

1290
01:36:02,855 --> 01:36:04,692
Is this what you're
looking for?

1291
01:36:04,725 --> 01:36:06,927
Three sixes, fool.

1292
01:36:42,363 --> 01:36:44,666
Just another dirty huckster.

1293
01:37:06,787 --> 01:37:10,725
An Achilles heel in an
otherwise formidable foe.

1294
01:37:17,631 --> 01:37:20,901
Indeed there is some
magic left in mortal men.

1295
01:37:26,707 --> 01:37:30,444
Pity we couldn't save him.

1296
01:37:30,476 --> 01:37:31,912
It's tragic.

1297
01:37:31,944 --> 01:37:34,849
Tragic is the way he
was living before.

1298
01:37:34,881 --> 01:37:36,817
He's free now.

1299
01:37:37,818 --> 01:37:43,423
Salt, are you acknowledging
the possibility of a soul?

1300
01:37:43,457 --> 01:37:45,593
Perhaps.

1301
01:37:46,726 --> 01:37:50,831
Gentlemen, it has been
a magical acquaintance.

1302
01:37:50,863 --> 01:37:53,600
A deal's a deal.

1303
01:37:59,706 --> 01:38:01,909
I will not stop until the
game is over and I am

1304
01:38:01,942 --> 01:38:04,112
declared the victor.

1305
01:38:05,945 --> 01:38:07,914
You deserve it, Mr. Peter.

1306
01:38:11,217 --> 01:38:13,887
I have no place
to put this.

1307
01:38:13,921 --> 01:38:15,523
Would you relieve
me of this burden?

1308
01:38:15,555 --> 01:38:17,090
I can't take this.

1309
01:38:17,123 --> 01:38:19,460
But you can.

1310
01:38:20,961 --> 01:38:23,864
Even I know love
most conquer all.

1311
01:38:23,896 --> 01:38:27,501
Go back to town.
Find your Bess.

1312
01:38:27,533 --> 01:38:29,469
And you, Mr. Peter?

1313
01:38:29,502 --> 01:38:32,872
I'm off the find
the next adventure.

1314
01:38:32,905 --> 01:38:35,775
And to die with a
smile on my face.

1315
01:39:10,243 --> 01:39:13,514
Bess, for once
you didn't draw.

1316
01:39:14,814 --> 01:39:16,015
What are you crying for?

1317
01:39:16,048 --> 01:39:18,118
I thought I lost you.

1318
01:39:18,150 --> 01:39:20,887
I never left you, darling.

1319
01:39:20,921 --> 01:39:25,926
The hotel meant
nothing without you.

1320
01:39:25,958 --> 01:39:29,563
Well, I guess we're
gonna need this now.

1321
01:39:29,595 --> 01:39:31,030
How you figure that?

1322
01:39:31,064 --> 01:39:34,034
I raised the finances.

1323
01:39:36,802 --> 01:39:39,773
It's a miracle.
How'd you do it?

1324
01:39:39,805 --> 01:39:41,174
How'd you do it?

1325
01:39:41,207 --> 01:39:44,277
God works in
mysterious ways, Bess.

1326
01:39:44,310 --> 01:39:47,614
And love comes when
you least expect it.

1327
01:39:48,814 --> 01:39:50,783
I see it all in my
mind now, Bobby.

1328
01:39:50,817 --> 01:39:52,185
Clear as day.

1329
01:39:53,554 --> 01:39:55,222
What should we call it?

1330
01:39:56,957 --> 01:39:58,926
The Redemption.

1331
01:39:58,958 --> 01:40:01,561
I like the sound of that.
