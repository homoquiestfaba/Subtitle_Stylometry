00:00:00,264 --> 00:00:02,356
Matt: Hello everyone. My name is Matthew Mercer,

2
00:00:02,356 --> 00:00:03,819
voice actor and Dungeon Master

3
00:00:03,819 --> 00:00:05,578
for Critical Role on Geek and Sundry,

4
00:00:05,578 --> 00:00:07,791
where I take a bunch of other voice actors and

5
00:00:07,791 --> 00:00:09,597
run them through a fantastical fantasy adventure

6
00:00:09,597 --> 00:00:11,429
through the world of Dungeons and Dragons.

7
00:00:11,429 --> 00:00:13,691
We play every Thursday at 7 PM Pacific Standard time

8
00:00:13,691 --> 00:00:15,320
on Geek and Sundry's Twitch stream.

9
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:17,383
Please come watch us live if you have the opportunity.

10
00:00:17,383 --> 00:00:19,205
Back episodes and future episodes will be

11
00:00:19,205 --> 00:00:21,448
uploaded on the Geek and Sundry website.

12
00:00:21,448 --> 00:00:22,693
So, you can also check them out there.

13
00:00:22,693 --> 00:00:24,286
In the meantime, enjoy!

14
00:00:24,286 --> 00:00:27,517
Matt: Welcome to first episode of Critical Role,

15
00:00:27,517 --> 00:00:28,969
and what this basically is,

16
00:00:28,969 --> 00:00:30,763
is a continuation of our weekly D&amp;D game.

17
00:00:30,763 --> 00:00:33,013
Me and a bunch of other likely nerdy and enjoyable

18
00:00:33,013 --> 00:00:34,683
voice actors gathering around,

19
00:00:34,683 --> 00:00:36,078
rolling some dice, killing some creatures,

20
00:00:36,078 --> 00:00:37,750
having some adventure.

21
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:39,040
And now we have the pleasure of it bringing it

22
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:40,402
on the stream for you to watch,

23
00:00:40,402 --> 00:00:42,582
enjoy, and occasionally interact with.

24
00:00:42,582 --> 00:00:45,090
So before we get to that: to give you a little backstory

25
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:47,131
on the characters you'll be seeing this evening,

26
00:00:47,131 --> 00:00:49,093
we're going to play some videos for you in just a second.

27
00:00:49,093 --> 00:00:51,184
But, do note for all you hardcore gamers out there,

28
00:00:51,184 --> 00:00:52,647
a lot of this is house-ruled,

29
00:00:52,647 --> 00:00:54,297
kinda loosey-goosey having a good time.

30
00:00:54,297 --> 00:00:56,735
So all you number crunchers, stop paying attention there,

31
00:00:56,735 --> 00:00:58,064
just have fun with it.

32
00:00:58,064 --> 00:00:59,835
But nevertheless, we have some background story

33
00:00:59,835 --> 00:01:01,734
on many of the characters you'll be seeing this evening

34
00:01:01,734 --> 00:01:03,950
to help you jump into the story.

35
00:01:03,950 --> 00:01:06,841
Let’s go ahead and enjoy those in just a minute then

36
00:01:06,841 --> 00:01:08,864
we'll introduce the players, so, have fun.

37
00:01:09,889 --> 00:01:12,634
Grog: Right, Listen up! If you have ale,

38
00:01:12,634 --> 00:01:16,790
then you have a friend in Grog Strongjaw!

39
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:20,637
A goliath of towering height and size,

40
00:01:20,637 --> 00:01:23,646
this barbarian has an appetite for the two great

41
00:01:23,646 --> 00:01:29,543
loves in his life: combat, women, and ale! (chuckle)

42
00:01:29,543 --> 00:01:30,604
(record scratch)

43
00:01:30,604 --> 00:01:31,637
Wait.

44
00:01:31,637 --> 00:01:33,989
Easily the brains of the group,

45
00:01:33,989 --> 00:01:37,354
Grog is often consulted for his vast knowledge

46
00:01:37,354 --> 00:01:41,454
of shapes, colors, and (chuckle) shiny things!

47
00:01:41,454 --> 00:01:43,345
...also ale.

48
00:01:43,345 --> 00:01:47,516
In his early years, armed with his two handed great axe,

49
00:01:47,516 --> 00:01:50,263
Grog often enjoyed proving his might amongst the ranks

50
00:01:50,263 --> 00:01:53,164
of his family's wandering herd.

51
00:01:53,164 --> 00:01:57,333
But after coming upon an unsuspecting elderly gnome in the woods,

52
00:01:57,333 --> 00:02:01,390
he objected to the killing of such an innocent life.

53
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:06,430
A creature of impulse, Grog felt only pity for this...

54
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:09,565
well this terrified little thing.

55
00:02:09,565 --> 00:02:12,248
And his disobedience cost him dearly.

56
00:02:12,248 --> 00:02:13,554
(weapon crack)

57
00:02:13,554 --> 00:02:16,462
Beaten bloody, and banished by the herd leader,

58
00:02:16,462 --> 00:02:18,039
his uncle Kevdak,

59
00:02:18,039 --> 00:02:21,397
Grog was abandoned and left to die.

60
00:02:21,397 --> 00:02:24,871
Exiled from his herd, it was then that

61
00:02:24,871 --> 00:02:27,683
the relative of the very gnome he fought to save,

62
00:02:27,683 --> 00:02:30,094
saved him.

63
00:02:30,094 --> 00:02:33,441
It was the kindness of a gnome cleric named Pike,

64
00:02:33,441 --> 00:02:37,739
that healed Grog, bringing him back from death's edge.

65
00:02:37,739 --> 00:02:40,843
And they have remained close friends ever since.

66
00:02:40,843 --> 00:02:42,325
(brawling sounds)

67
00:02:42,325 --> 00:02:44,465
Most nights, Grog can be found challenging

68
00:02:44,465 --> 00:02:47,323
entire taverns to wrestling matches! Ha!

69
00:02:47,323 --> 00:02:50,704
...or accompanying Scanlan to the nearest house,

70
00:02:50,704 --> 00:02:52,778
where you pay for...

71
00:02:52,778 --> 00:02:53,991
lady favors.

72
00:02:53,991 --> 00:02:56,823
Also ale!

73
00:02:56,823 --> 00:02:59,358
Keyleth: A first Impression of Keyleth would

74
00:02:59,358 --> 00:03:00,832
leave you with little information

75
00:03:00,832 --> 00:03:02,737
on the half-elven druid.

76
00:03:02,737 --> 00:03:04,968
You might even think that her social awkwardness

77
00:03:04,968 --> 00:03:07,353
due to her sheltered upbringing is kinda sweet.

78
00:03:07,353 --> 00:03:08,588
(chuckle)

79
00:03:08,588 --> 00:03:11,611
Of course, it would be unwise underestimate her

80
00:03:11,611 --> 00:03:13,052
based on first impressions.

81
00:03:13,052 --> 00:03:14,675
(thunder crack)

82
00:03:14,675 --> 00:03:17,368
Under that unintimidating petite frame is a

83
00:03:17,368 --> 00:03:19,877
vicious beast waiting to be unleashed,

84
00:03:19,877 --> 00:03:22,166
whose natural powers have made even the fiercest of

85
00:03:22,166 --> 00:03:25,026
champions pee their pants, literally!

86
00:03:25,026 --> 00:03:26,654
(soft chuckle)

87
00:03:26,654 --> 00:03:29,529
Born to the Air Tribe of the Ashari people,

88
00:03:29,529 --> 00:03:30,827
Keyleth was raised with a deep love

89
00:03:30,827 --> 00:03:33,768
of nature and the elemental magics.

90
00:03:33,768 --> 00:03:36,248
It is her people’s inherent duty to protect the

91
00:03:36,248 --> 00:03:38,491
delicate areas in Tal'Dorei

92
00:03:38,491 --> 00:03:41,667
where the four elemental planes begin to bleed with this realm.

93
00:03:41,667 --> 00:03:44,850
Since she was a little girl, she had quite a knack

94
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:48,523
for air manipulation and beast shaping abilities.

95
00:03:48,523 --> 00:03:50,176
Well, if you consider kittens and

96
00:03:50,176 --> 00:03:52,547
flying squirrels to be little beasts.

97
00:03:52,547 --> 00:03:53,995
Which, I do.

98
00:03:53,995 --> 00:03:55,375
(clears throat)

99
00:03:55,375 --> 00:03:58,580
Anyways, it wasn't long before the headmaster of the tribe,

100
00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:00,231
her father, Kohren,

101
00:04:00,231 --> 00:04:02,657
realized her true prodigious abilities and

102
00:04:02,657 --> 00:04:06,971
she was inveterated to succeed him as the next headmaster.

103
00:04:06,971 --> 00:04:09,746
Just like that, her jovial childhood was stripped and

104
00:04:09,746 --> 00:04:12,169
replaced with endless spell memorization,

105
00:04:12,169 --> 00:04:14,349
teachings from ancient traditions,

106
00:04:14,349 --> 00:04:17,026
and exceedingly high expectations.

107
00:04:17,026 --> 00:04:19,362
Every druid leader to be must embark on a journey

108
00:04:19,362 --> 00:04:21,970
to seek out the sister tribes

109
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:23,987
in order to introduce and establish respect

110
00:04:23,987 --> 00:04:25,382
amongst the fellow headmasters.

111
00:04:26,139 --> 00:04:30,198
They call this the Aramente, or Noble Odyssey.

112
00:04:30,198 --> 00:04:32,678
When her father felt she was ready, he set her on the path

113
00:04:32,678 --> 00:04:35,103
to truly discovering herself.

114
00:04:35,103 --> 00:04:38,761
Not knowing when, or if she will ever return.

115
00:04:38,761 --> 00:04:41,527
As she hiked down the mountain towards Stillben,

116
00:04:41,527 --> 00:04:43,908
she meditated on the task ahead.

117
00:04:43,908 --> 00:04:45,934
Part of the Aramente is proving yourself

118
00:04:45,934 --> 00:04:48,973
a strong warrior, a valiant protector,

119
00:04:48,973 --> 00:04:51,893
and a wise and compassionate leader.

120
00:04:51,893 --> 00:04:54,128
With this knowledge, one thought plays

121
00:04:54,128 --> 00:04:56,494
in repeat in her mind:

122
00:04:56,494 --> 00:04:59,276
Is she even worthy?

123
00:05:01,283 --> 00:05:03,620
Percy: Percy was the third child of 7 children,

124
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:05,861
born to a noble family who lived far to the

125
00:05:05,861 --> 00:05:09,042
north in the ancient castle of Whitestone.

126
00:05:09,042 --> 00:05:10,911
With so many siblings to share the burdens of

127
00:05:10,911 --> 00:05:13,273
lordship, Percy turned his attention to the

128
00:05:13,273 --> 00:05:16,933
sciences, engineering, and naturalism.

129
00:05:16,933 --> 00:05:19,189
One day, a mysterious couple,

130
00:05:19,189 --> 00:05:21,894
named Lord and Lady Briarwood, came to court.

131
00:05:21,894 --> 00:05:24,002
During a feast held in their honour,

132
00:05:24,002 --> 00:05:26,828
the Briarwoods violently took control of the castle,

133
00:05:26,828 --> 00:05:30,766
killing or imprisoning everyone who would stand in their way.

134
00:05:30,766 --> 00:05:32,802
Percy awoke chained in the dungeon,

135
00:05:32,802 --> 00:05:35,789
only to be freed by his younger sister.

136
00:05:35,789 --> 00:05:39,266
Together they fled, chased by the Briarwoods’ men.

137
00:05:39,266 --> 00:05:41,484
As they ran, Percy’s sister took

138
00:05:41,484 --> 00:05:44,059
several arrows to the chest and fell.

139
00:05:44,059 --> 00:05:46,533
Percy kept running, eventually jumping into

140
00:05:46,533 --> 00:05:50,094
a freezing river and floating unconscious to freedom.

141
00:05:50,094 --> 00:05:52,850
He did not remember waking up on a fishing boat.

142
00:05:52,850 --> 00:05:55,273
He barely remembered the next two years, as he

143
00:05:55,273 --> 00:05:59,324
slowly made his way as far south as possible.

144
00:05:59,324 --> 00:06:01,955
Then one night, Percy had a dream.

145
00:06:01,955 --> 00:06:04,356
A roaring cloud of smoke offered him

146
00:06:04,356 --> 00:06:07,426
vengeance against those who destroyed his family.

147
00:06:07,426 --> 00:06:12,343
When he awoke, Percy began to design his first gun.

148
00:06:15,008 --> 00:06:18,256
Scanlan: Oh, you haven’t heard of Scanlan Shorthalt?

149
00:06:18,256 --> 00:06:19,759
Well, gird your loins, ladies,

150
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:21,931
because he has his eye on you.

151
00:06:21,931 --> 00:06:24,623
A talented musician, master of disguise, and dashingly

152
00:06:24,623 --> 00:06:27,690
handsome in his own mind, Scanlan sings songs

153
00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:31,149
almost as much as he sings his own praises.

154
00:06:31,149 --> 00:06:33,780
Born a poor Gnome, Scanlan used his endless

155
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:35,955
charm and soaring tenor voice to

156
00:06:35,955 --> 00:06:39,164
croon for coin and support his single mother.

157
00:06:39,164 --> 00:06:41,844
One day he was discovered by a half-orc promoter,

158
00:06:41,844 --> 00:06:45,338
and joined Dr. Dranzel’s Spectacular Traveling Troupe

159
00:06:45,338 --> 00:06:47,708
where he learned the ways of the world,

160
00:06:47,708 --> 00:06:51,602
and honed his skills as a bard extraordinaire.

161
00:06:51,602 --> 00:06:54,180
A loner much of his life, Scanlan has never quite

162
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:55,802
come to terms with the violent

163
00:06:55,802 --> 00:06:58,631
death of his mother at the hands of a Goblin invasion.

164
00:06:58,631 --> 00:07:02,317
While his years on the road provided many, shall we say,

165
00:07:02,317 --> 00:07:05,915
educational experiences with the opposite sex,

166
00:07:05,915 --> 00:07:07,808
deep down Scanlan yearns for the one thing

167
00:07:07,808 --> 00:07:10,058
he’s never known: the true love

168
00:07:10,058 --> 00:07:13,245
of a fellow Gnome.

169
00:07:13,245 --> 00:07:15,838
Still, Scanlan considers himself a lover first,

170
00:07:15,838 --> 00:07:19,336
performer second, and fighter distant third.

171
00:07:19,336 --> 00:07:21,722
On the battlefield, he’ll support his allies,

172
00:07:21,722 --> 00:07:24,919
but rarely draws blood unless it’s to protect

173
00:07:24,919 --> 00:07:28,925
fellow Gnome, Pike. Count on Scanlan for a hearty laugh,

174
00:07:28,925 --> 00:07:32,290
a rollicking song, and a twinkle in his eye that melts hearts

175
00:07:32,290 --> 00:07:35,130
and makes the females swoon.

176
00:07:36,648 --> 00:07:40,078
Tiberius: Greetings and salutations.

177
00:07:40,078 --> 00:07:42,232
I am Tiberius Stormwind.

178
00:07:42,232 --> 00:07:44,279
I hail from a town called Ty'rex,

179
00:07:44,279 --> 00:07:46,375
located in the heart of Draconia,

180
00:07:46,375 --> 00:07:48,554
born from a politically respected family.

181
00:07:48,554 --> 00:07:51,861
At the age of 15, I succeeded in passing the Sorcerer’s Rite,

182
00:07:51,861 --> 00:07:54,516
showing prodigy-like control of my magic.

183
00:07:54,516 --> 00:07:57,027
The judges and the Draconian high council were amazed at

184
00:07:57,027 --> 00:08:00,291
how powerful my spells were for how long I had been training.

185
00:08:00,291 --> 00:08:02,913
At 20 years old, I was the youngest appointed member

186
00:08:02,913 --> 00:08:05,834
of the magic guild in Draconian history. For the

187
00:08:05,834 --> 00:08:07,595
next few years, I almost went mad from the

188
00:08:07,595 --> 00:08:09,753
malaise of being a guild member,

189
00:08:09,753 --> 00:08:11,962
as it’s rather boring.

190
00:08:11,962 --> 00:08:14,443
However, one day I happened upon a chamber,

191
00:08:14,443 --> 00:08:16,748
unused for quite some time.

192
00:08:16,748 --> 00:08:18,571
In the room were stacks of books and maps

193
00:08:18,571 --> 00:08:20,599
of the surrounding cities and areas

194
00:08:20,599 --> 00:08:22,122
around the known world.

195
00:08:22,122 --> 00:08:24,639
For months I would frequent the chamber, and learned

196
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:26,512
of artifacts from legend.

197
00:08:26,512 --> 00:08:29,025
After a long period of research, I made a list of artifacts

198
00:08:29,025 --> 00:08:30,786
that caught my eye.

199
00:08:30,786 --> 00:08:33,179
I brought these findings to the high council and was told that

200
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:35,801
all of the information in the chamber I had stumbled upon

201
00:08:35,801 --> 00:08:39,641
was either believed to be fiction, or unsolvable mysteries,

202
00:08:39,641 --> 00:08:42,075
and hence were lost forever.

203
00:08:42,075 --> 00:08:44,836
I found those answers to be unacceptable.

204
00:08:44,836 --> 00:08:47,154
A year later I devised a ruse and managed to

205
00:08:47,154 --> 00:08:48,751
convince the city council to lend support

206
00:08:48,751 --> 00:08:51,444
in me leaving Draconia on a mission of peace

207
00:08:51,444 --> 00:08:53,713
and diplomacy for the surrounding kingdoms.

208
00:08:53,713 --> 00:08:55,891
Going from town to town and making friends and allies,

209
00:08:55,891 --> 00:08:58,196
in and for the name of Draconia.

210
00:08:58,196 --> 00:08:59,625
Being a red dragonborn,

211
00:08:59,625 --> 00:09:03,043
I had quite the task on my hands in that respect,

212
00:09:03,043 --> 00:09:05,781
but it was exactly what I needed so I could explore

213
00:09:05,781 --> 00:09:07,815
the world and find these artifacts,

214
00:09:07,815 --> 00:09:10,295
as I felt the truth was out there.

215
00:09:10,295 --> 00:09:12,147
Some may describe me as buffoonish,

216
00:09:12,147 --> 00:09:15,001
but I say poppycock to all that.

217
00:09:15,001 --> 00:09:17,207
I am much sharper than most give me credit for.

218
00:09:17,207 --> 00:09:20,517
I just don’t pay attention to things sometimes.

219
00:09:20,517 --> 00:09:23,444
I’ve also been known to be rather cunning, loyal,

220
00:09:23,444 --> 00:09:27,491
happy-go-lucky, and well, dangerous.

221
00:09:27,491 --> 00:09:30,532
I can’t help but show my true scales every now and then.

222
00:09:30,532 --> 00:09:33,955
But overall, I think I’m quite friendly for a Dragonborn.

223
00:09:35,261 --> 00:09:37,173
Vax: Never entirely welcome in the company of

224
00:09:37,173 --> 00:09:38,844
elves or men, Vax'ildan learned

225
00:09:38,844 --> 00:09:41,822
at a young age to skip past formality,

226
00:09:41,822 --> 00:09:45,860
preferring instead to invite himself in your door.

227
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:47,837
Along with twin sister Vex'ahlia,

228
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:50,815
Vax was born by a chance encounter between Elven

229
00:09:50,815 --> 00:09:53,536
royalty and Human peasantry.

230
00:09:53,536 --> 00:09:56,009
Raised by their mother in their early years, the twins

231
00:09:56,009 --> 00:09:57,991
were eventually sent off to their father

232
00:09:57,991 --> 00:10:00,349
in the Elven capital of Singorn.

233
00:10:00,349 --> 00:10:03,459
But their cool reception among the Elves there never warmed,

234
00:10:03,459 --> 00:10:06,617
and their time in the capital didn’t last.

235
00:10:06,617 --> 00:10:09,220
The siblings stole away one autumn night and set out on

236
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:11,580
the open road.

237
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:14,399
After a few years of wandering, they eventually decided to

238
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:16,626
return to their mother, and journeyed

239
00:10:16,626 --> 00:10:18,765
back to the lands of their youth.

240
00:10:18,765 --> 00:10:21,504
But instead of finding their childhood home,

241
00:10:21,504 --> 00:10:24,188
they returned to a pile of rubble.

242
00:10:24,188 --> 00:10:27,470
Their mother was gone, their home burned to ash.

243
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:30,155
Pressing the townspeople for answers,

244
00:10:30,155 --> 00:10:36,051
they learned of the day the dragon came.

245
00:10:36,051 --> 00:10:39,526
With their ties all severed, Vax'ildan and his sister

246
00:10:39,526 --> 00:10:42,914
set out to find their fortune together in Tal'Dorei.

247
00:10:42,914 --> 00:10:47,193
An outsider since birth, Vax quickly learned to solve life’s

248
00:10:47,193 --> 00:10:50,862
challenges in his own particular way,

249
00:10:50,862 --> 00:10:53,463
often by sidestepping them entirely.

250
00:10:53,463 --> 00:10:56,736
And when his knack for circumventing adversity isn’t enough,

251
00:10:56,736 --> 00:11:00,801
the way of blades the elves schooled him in

252
00:11:00,801 --> 00:11:03,271
more than makes up the difference.

253
00:11:04,354 --> 00:11:06,283
Vex: Like so many Half-Elves,

254
00:11:06,283 --> 00:11:08,791
Vex'ahlia has spent most of her life suffering

255
00:11:08,791 --> 00:11:13,486
the cool reception of a people who don’t fully accept her.

256
00:11:13,486 --> 00:11:17,364
Born of a Human mother, and an elven father who only later in life

257
00:11:17,364 --> 00:11:20,091
took an interest in their existence,

258
00:11:20,091 --> 00:11:23,427
Vex'ahlia and her twin brother Vax'ildan quickly

259
00:11:23,427 --> 00:11:26,696
realized the only people they could truly rely on

260
00:11:26,696 --> 00:11:29,910
in this world were each other.

261
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:33,046
It was at the age of 10 when the two were taken from their mother,

262
00:11:33,046 --> 00:11:35,062
and brought to live in Singorn,

263
00:11:35,062 --> 00:11:39,105
the isolated Elven city for which their father was an ambassador.

264
00:11:39,105 --> 00:11:43,263
He quietly took them in, but always kept an icy distance,

265
00:11:43,263 --> 00:11:46,039
and after too many years of disdainful looks,

266
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:49,756
the pair decided to leave his indifference behind,

267
00:11:49,756 --> 00:11:52,005
and set out on their own.

268
00:11:52,005 --> 00:11:55,656
Vax took to the cities, stealing small trinkets and

269
00:11:55,656 --> 00:11:58,675
learning the ways of the thief,

270
00:11:58,675 --> 00:12:01,463
while Vex kept to the woods.

271
00:12:01,463 --> 00:12:03,663
She preferred the isolation.

272
00:12:03,663 --> 00:12:07,696
Always the keen observer, she learned to hunt and to track,

273
00:12:07,696 --> 00:12:10,352
to spy and to shoot.

274
00:12:10,352 --> 00:12:12,684
And through a series of fateful events,

275
00:12:12,684 --> 00:12:16,293
earned herself a companion in the form of a bear -

276
00:12:16,293 --> 00:12:18,897
her own stolen Trinket -

277
00:12:18,897 --> 00:12:22,209
to fight alongside her and protect her fiercely.

278
00:12:22,209 --> 00:12:27,491
Also he is adorable, and gives expert massages.

279
00:12:29,296 --> 00:12:31,745
Matt: All right, hey guys, welcome back.

280
00:12:31,745 --> 00:12:33,364
So to give you a little heads up,

281
00:12:33,364 --> 00:12:36,634
we are playing the 5th edition of Dungeons and Dragons.

282
00:12:36,634 --> 00:12:38,370
We recently converted over from Pathfinder,

283
00:12:38,370 --> 00:12:39,957
for those who play Pathfinder.

284
00:12:39,957 --> 00:12:42,142
And one of our players was a gunslinger for which there are

285
00:12:42,142 --> 00:12:43,482
no rules for in 5th edition.

286
00:12:43,482 --> 00:12:45,000
So I had to create and customize those

287
00:12:46,672 --> 00:12:48,569
for the game, so bear with us on that.

288
00:12:48,569 --> 00:12:50,794
That will be an interesting ride regardless.

289
00:12:50,794 --> 00:12:51,818
We do have an 8 player game we’ve been playing for two years

290
00:12:51,818 --> 00:12:53,846
which is a little crazy,

291
00:12:53,846 --> 00:12:54,909
which is why we go a little loose with the rules.

292
00:12:54,909 --> 00:12:56,093
But it's a great group,

293
00:12:56,093 --> 00:12:58,921
it's a lot of fun, and not everyone can make every game

294
00:12:58,921 --> 00:13:01,396
so we have enough players to definitely pull a party each time.

295
00:13:01,396 --> 00:13:04,016
Zac: (Off screen) Just so you know we're having an audio bottleneck.

296
00:13:04,016 --> 00:13:05,706
It'll take about 30 seconds to work itself out.

297
00:13:05,706 --> 00:13:07,401
Matt: Okay, audio bottleneck.

298
00:13:12,148 --> 00:13:14,771
Matt: You let us know when it’s okay to talk.

299
00:13:16,589 --> 00:13:18,903
Travis: I don’t know what that means, a bottleneck.

300
00:13:24,406 --> 00:13:28,516
Matt: Are we all right? And how are we?

301
00:13:33,165 --> 00:13:35,978
Exterminate. Exterminate.

302
00:13:37,426 --> 00:13:38,894
Sam: Nice, nice.

303
00:13:40,685 --> 00:13:42,653
Audio isn't working they're going to watch something else.

304
00:13:43,723 --> 00:13:45,678
Thanks, douche.

305
00:13:45,678 --> 00:13:47,868
(all laugh)

306
00:13:47,868 --> 00:13:49,947
Matt: Is the mic adjusted? Is it any better?

307
00:13:49,947 --> 00:13:50,900
Zack: (Off screen) Better now. We're good.

308
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:52,345
Matt: All right, well good, well great. Thank you guys.

309
00:13:52,345 --> 00:13:54,475
So a couple of things transitioned from Pathfinder to 5th edition

310
00:13:54,475 --> 00:13:55,760
may be a little strange and fun.

311
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,804
Matt: We have a lot of players but they're great folks and

312
00:13:57,804 --> 00:13:59,658
most of that just means I have to work really hard to make sure

313
00:13:59,658 --> 00:14:02,333
the game keeps going, so that's on me.

314
00:14:02,333 --> 00:14:03,500
Matt: Ashley Johnson, unfortunately, cannot join us.

315
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:06,620
She's our gnome cleric, Pike.

316
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:07,607
She'll be here next week.

317
00:14:07,607 --> 00:14:10,253
Matt: Unfortunately, she's in London accepting a BAFTA,

318
00:14:10,253 --> 00:14:12,374
so I think we're okay.

319
00:14:12,374 --> 00:14:14,255
For the Last of Us. That's harsh.

320
00:14:14,255 --> 00:14:15,908
Travis: Yeah!

321
00:14:17,003 --> 00:14:18,411
Matt: Yeah, also no donations this week,

322
00:14:18,411 --> 00:14:19,530
but going forward we will have donations available

323
00:14:19,530 --> 00:14:20,256
for those that will help partially run the show

324
00:14:20,256 --> 00:14:22,693
from our local cameraman and crew.

325
00:14:22,693 --> 00:14:25,397
Matt: Also half of our donations will go to charity.

326
00:14:25,397 --> 00:14:27,379
For the 826 charity, Marisha if you want to talk

327
00:14:27,379 --> 00:14:29,187
a little about that.

328
00:14:29,187 --> 00:14:31,013
Marisha: Yes! 826LA is a charity that focuses on

329
00:14:31,013 --> 00:14:35,667
tutoring children in an after-school program and

330
00:14:35,667 --> 00:14:38,960
helping specifically with creativity, storytelling,

331
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:45,000
art and general things that kind of relate to Dungeons &amp; Dragons.

332
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,226
You should definitely check out the Time Travel Mart,

333
00:14:47,226 --> 00:14:50,524
which there is one in Echo Park and one in Mar Vista.

334
00:14:50,524 --> 00:14:51,793
So they have this amazing storefront

335
00:14:51,793 --> 00:14:54,446
where you can buy these awesome tchotchkes

336
00:14:54,446 --> 00:15:00,011
and things that go immediately to support the charity and the stream.

337
00:15:00,011 --> 00:15:02,900
And it's awesome. It's 826LA, you should look it up.

338
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:04,711
And there's a few all over the country.

339
00:15:04,711 --> 00:15:07,195
Matt: Yes. Also as a heads up,

340
00:15:07,195 --> 00:15:09,191
‘cause I saw some of you guys ask me in the chatroom.

341
00:15:09,191 --> 00:15:10,861
These videos will be available on the

342
00:15:10,861 --> 00:15:12,211
Geek and Sundry YouTube Channel soon enough,

343
00:15:12,211 --> 00:15:14,374
as well as a more extensive backstory of the party.

344
00:15:14,374 --> 00:15:15,774
So we'll have all that content ready for you

345
00:15:15,774 --> 00:15:17,710
so you don't have to memorize it.

346
00:15:17,710 --> 00:15:18,976
Maybe a bio page, I don't know.

347
00:15:18,976 --> 00:15:20,612
We'll figure something out. It'll be fine.

348
00:15:20,612 --> 00:15:22,117
But anyway, let's open that up.

349
00:15:22,117 --> 00:15:23,694
You know who I am. Matthew Mercer, voice actor

350
00:15:23,694 --> 00:15:24,919
and I've been running this game for two years.

351
00:15:24,919 --> 00:15:26,553
I'm a hardcore nerd.

352
00:15:26,553 --> 00:15:28,058
Let's go around the table and introduce our players

353
00:15:28,058 --> 00:15:31,391
so you can attach the faces to the intros you just saw.

354
00:15:31,391 --> 00:15:34,035
Let's start on this side with Travis.

355
00:15:34,035 --> 00:15:39,305
Travis: Oh! Hi. I'm Travis Willingham, voice actor, gamer.

356
00:15:39,305 --> 00:15:44,493
I play Grog the Goliath Barbarian.

357
00:15:48,159 --> 00:15:52,661
Laura: Hi. I'm Laura Bailey. I'm also, you know,

358
00:15:52,661 --> 00:15:55,940
a voice actor like kind of everyone here.

359
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:56,899
Travis: Yeah. I think we all are.

360
00:15:56,899 --> 00:16:00,473
Laura: And I'm playing Vex'ahlia. The coolest chick ever.

361
00:16:00,473 --> 00:16:02,169
(all laugh)

362
00:16:02,169 --> 00:16:02,904
Matt: The ranger with the bear.

363
00:16:02,904 --> 00:16:04,473
Laura: The ranger with the bear named Trinket

364
00:16:04,473 --> 00:16:05,553
in case you didn't catch that.

365
00:16:05,553 --> 00:16:08,128
His name is Trinket and he's amazing.

366
00:16:08,493 --> 00:16:11,660
Liam: Hi, I'm Liam O'Brien. I'm playing Vax'ildan.

367
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:15,855
This one's twin. We're Half-Elven twins.

368
00:16:15,855 --> 00:16:20,223
And I started playing D&amp;D when I was 13 and

369
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:22,003
I can't believe this is happening. So -

370
00:16:22,003 --> 00:16:23,078
(all laugh)

371
00:16:23,078 --> 00:16:26,506
Liam: Cheers. Cheers to this.

372
00:16:26,506 --> 00:16:30,057
Taliesin: My name is Taliesin Jaffe.

373
00:16:30,057 --> 00:16:32,524
I'm a voice actor, director,

374
00:16:32,524 --> 00:16:36,324
and I've been playing some form of Dungeons and Dragons,

375
00:16:36,324 --> 00:16:38,653
and if you can't tell by my black clothing,

376
00:16:38,653 --> 00:16:41,750
a lot of Vampire the Masquerade when I was a teenager.

377
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:43,388
There was a problem.

378
00:16:43,388 --> 00:16:45,461
I'm playing Percy, the Gunslinger.

379
00:16:45,461 --> 00:16:47,570
So I'm the reason all the rules are all messed up.

380
00:16:47,570 --> 00:16:49,246
(all laugh)

381
00:16:51,048 --> 00:16:56,530
Marisha: I am Keyleth, the Druid from the tribe of the Air Ashari.

382
00:16:56,530 --> 00:16:58,746
And I am a Half-Elven person.

383
00:16:58,746 --> 00:16:59,746
Matt: No, you're Elven.

384
00:16:59,746 --> 00:17:00,741
Marisha: No, Half-Elf.

385
00:17:00,741 --> 00:17:01,933
Matt: Half-Elf. Okay.

386
00:17:01,933 --> 00:17:03,447
Marisha: Yeah, Come on man. I've been Half-Elf since day one.

387
00:17:03,447 --> 00:17:03,833
Matt: We have a lot of Half-Elves.

388
00:17:03,833 --> 00:17:05,170
Laura: Yeah we do.

389
00:17:05,170 --> 00:17:06,525
Matt: I misunderstood.

390
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:09,601
Marisha: Yes! You can see me shooting lightning and

391
00:17:09,601 --> 00:17:12,198
turning into awesome animals.

392
00:17:14,966 --> 00:17:15,971
Matt: Orion.

393
00:17:15,971 --> 00:17:16,830
Orion: Hi.

394
00:17:16,830 --> 00:17:17,208
Matt: Hi.

395
00:17:17,208 --> 00:17:18,725
Orion: Hey everybody.

396
00:17:18,725 --> 00:17:20,128
(all laugh)

397
00:17:20,128 --> 00:17:23,998
Orion: I'm Orion Acaba and I'm also a voice actor.

398
00:17:23,998 --> 00:17:25,286
I do things.

399
00:17:25,286 --> 00:17:25,713
Marisha: Oh, I'm Marisha Ray, by the way.

400
00:17:25,713 --> 00:17:27,160
Orion: Yeah!

401
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:27,417
Marisha: Did I say that?

402
00:17:27,417 --> 00:17:28,590
Orion: Keyleth is Marisha Ray.

403
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:30,452
Matt: Let Orion have his moment. Don't try and break...

404
00:17:30,452 --> 00:17:32,655
Orion: No, it's our moment.

405
00:17:32,655 --> 00:17:32,905
Matt: There ya go. All right.

406
00:17:32,905 --> 00:17:35,866
Orion: And I'm Tiberius the awesome Sorcerer.

407
00:17:35,866 --> 00:17:37,151
Matt: Dragonborn Sorcerer.

408
00:17:37,151 --> 00:17:38,689
Orion: Dragonborn, yeah! That's right.

409
00:17:38,689 --> 00:17:41,271
Sam: And I'm Sam Riegel a voice actor, and stuff.

410
00:17:41,271 --> 00:17:44,328
My Character is Scanlan Shorthalt.

411
00:17:44,328 --> 00:17:47,504
The Gnome Bard who sings a lot.

412
00:17:47,504 --> 00:17:48,992
And let's start playing, yeah?

413
00:17:48,992 --> 00:17:51,691
(all cheer)

414
00:17:51,691 --> 00:17:53,878
Matt: All right! Let's jump on in. Thank you. So!

415
00:17:53,878 --> 00:17:56,268
Last we left off, just to give you a little backstory.

416
00:17:56,268 --> 00:17:58,739
The party had completed a large venture

417
00:17:58,739 --> 00:18:00,726
in saving the nearby city of Emon.

418
00:18:00,726 --> 00:18:01,954
One of the central capitals of this

419
00:18:01,954 --> 00:18:04,929
human civilization of Tal'Dorei.

420
00:18:04,929 --> 00:18:07,341
They managed to halt a demonic insurrection within the throne

421
00:18:07,341 --> 00:18:12,523
and as such were greeted to a hero's celebration

422
00:18:12,523 --> 00:18:15,356
and had a keep built in their honor.

423
00:18:15,647 --> 00:18:17,537
Over the six month period of the keep being constructed,

424
00:18:17,537 --> 00:18:18,806
they went their own ways and then returned

425
00:18:18,806 --> 00:18:21,110
to see its final creation.

426
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:22,646
However, they did not have a chance

427
00:18:22,646 --> 00:18:24,039
to really enjoy it immediately

428
00:18:24,039 --> 00:18:26,292
as one of their good friends and allies,

429
00:18:26,292 --> 00:18:30,106
Arcanist Allura Vysoren of the Tal'Dorei council

430
00:18:30,106 --> 00:18:32,075
came to them requesting their aid saying that

431
00:18:32,075 --> 00:18:34,218
a long time friend of hers, Lady Kima of Vord,

432
00:18:34,218 --> 00:18:36,695
who is a very well known and very well respected

433
00:18:36,695 --> 00:18:39,302
Halfling Paladin of Bahamut the Platinum Dragon

434
00:18:39,302 --> 00:18:42,073
had been gone on a pilgrimage for a while.

435
00:18:42,073 --> 00:18:43,183
Essentially a vision quest that is part

436
00:18:43,183 --> 00:18:46,222
of her own development as a Paladin.

437
00:18:46,222 --> 00:18:49,620
As part of this, she let the information go to Allura

438
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:52,131
that a dark vision had come to her

439
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:54,676
saying that some sort of evil root is

440
00:18:54,676 --> 00:18:58,910
beginning to breed beneath Kraghammer and the mountains within.

441
00:18:58,910 --> 00:19:01,167
Kraghammer, which is the nearby Dwarven civilization

442
00:19:01,167 --> 00:19:03,418
that you guys have previously not been allowed entry to.

443
00:19:03,418 --> 00:19:04,822
‘Cause the dwarves weren't fans of nobody

444
00:19:04,822 --> 00:19:08,194
without any political means of entry.

445
00:19:08,194 --> 00:19:10,493
However she managed to acquire the necessary documentation

446
00:19:10,493 --> 00:19:11,798
and offered you a very substantial reward

447
00:19:11,798 --> 00:19:14,605
should you find the whereabouts of Lady Kima of Vord

448
00:19:14,605 --> 00:19:17,607
and hopefully bring her back safely.

449
00:19:17,607 --> 00:19:22,258
You left on the pathway to the dwarven citadel of Kraghammer.

450
00:19:22,258 --> 00:19:29,032
You were ambushed by a group of roaming barbarian Goliaths.

451
00:19:29,032 --> 00:19:30,571
Of which, partway through the battle,

452
00:19:30,571 --> 00:19:35,615
Grog managed to recognize one of them as a previous ally.

453
00:19:35,615 --> 00:19:36,945
And no longer an ally at this time.

454
00:19:36,945 --> 00:19:38,460
Travis: Son of a bitch.

455
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:40,528
Matt: Yep, the Barbarian for his first and only time so far

456
00:19:40,528 --> 00:19:42,709
managed to avert battle through a social encounter

457
00:19:42,709 --> 00:19:44,978
and rolled pretty damn well on a persuasion check.

458
00:19:44,978 --> 00:19:47,208
So you got one. You get one.

459
00:19:47,208 --> 00:19:48,969
You got your one. Never again.

460
00:19:48,969 --> 00:19:49,840
Travis: Next time he dies.

461
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:50,444
Matt: Yeah. Essentially.

462
00:19:50,444 --> 00:19:52,255
(all laugh)

463
00:19:52,255 --> 00:19:54,998
Matt: But you managed to not turn it into complete bloodshed.

464
00:19:54,998 --> 00:19:57,391
And you continued on your way to Kraghammer,

465
00:19:57,391 --> 00:19:59,591
presented your paperwork, were given entry into the city

466
00:19:59,591 --> 00:20:02,467
and that is where we begin this adventure.

467
00:20:02,467 --> 00:20:03,183
Laura: Oh no.

468
00:20:03,183 --> 00:20:03,561
Sam: In the city of Kraghammer?

469
00:20:03,561 --> 00:20:04,995
Matt: In the city of Kraghammer.

470
00:20:04,995 --> 00:20:06,001
Sam: Wow! This is fantastic.

471
00:20:06,001 --> 00:20:07,245
Travis: We’re in, right?

472
00:20:07,245 --> 00:20:07,495
Marisha: Yes.

473
00:20:07,495 --> 00:20:08,278
Matt: So, you guys step-

474
00:20:08,278 --> 00:20:10,237
Marisha: We were at the door- We were talking to someone right?

475
00:20:10,237 --> 00:20:11,896
Matt: Yeah, you were talking to the front guards

476
00:20:11,896 --> 00:20:12,252
at the gate of Kraghammer.

477
00:20:12,252 --> 00:20:14,250
They have begrudgingly let you inside.

478
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:16,313
Giving you a couple of pointers little prods and sent you

479
00:20:16,313 --> 00:20:17,034
into the city proper.

480
00:20:17,034 --> 00:20:19,465
You made your way through the darkened alleyways

481
00:20:19,465 --> 00:20:22,587
and stone carved tunnel that leads into the main,

482
00:20:22,587 --> 00:20:25,341
central portion of the city proper.

483
00:20:25,341 --> 00:20:27,662
An enormous underground metropolis sprawls out before you-

484
00:20:27,662 --> 00:20:30,786
the dark earth and shadows creating beautiful stone work,

485
00:20:30,786 --> 00:20:33,902
marble columns, archways, and labyrinthine bridges

486
00:20:33,902 --> 00:20:36,924
climbing across the vertical city-scape.

487
00:20:36,924 --> 00:20:39,469
All warmed within the red glow of some strange,

488
00:20:39,469 --> 00:20:42,042
crimson rock peppered throughout the town as a light source.

489
00:20:42,042 --> 00:20:44,957
A large metal forge envelops the center of this cylindrical city.

490
00:20:44,957 --> 00:20:49,534
The entire is a three tiered cylindrical city that is built

491
00:20:49,534 --> 00:20:51,399
into the ground of the mountain itself.

492
00:20:51,399 --> 00:20:54,364
Welcome to Kraghammer!

493
00:20:55,486 --> 00:20:58,028
Liam: Remind us- Did we bullshit our way in here, or did-

494
00:20:58,028 --> 00:20:59,286
Laura: No, we had a way in.

495
00:20:59,286 --> 00:21:01,286
Matt: No, Allura got your paperwork

496
00:21:01,286 --> 00:21:03,139
because you were unable to get in this time.

497
00:21:03,139 --> 00:21:05,050
Laura: But, Ashley speaks dwarven- Pike speaks...

498
00:21:05,050 --> 00:21:07,483
Matt: Pike- Pike speaks dwarvish.

499
00:21:07,483 --> 00:21:08,393
Laura: And she's not-

500
00:21:08,393 --> 00:21:08,643
Matt: And she's not here.

501
00:21:08,643 --> 00:21:10,606
Tiberius: I-I speak Dwarvish as well!

502
00:21:10,606 --> 00:21:10,856
Vex'alia: Oh good!

503
00:21:10,856 --> 00:21:11,203
Tiberius: I do.

504
00:21:11,203 --> 00:21:14,265
Scanlan: That's fantastic.

505
00:21:14,265 --> 00:21:15,681
Keyleth: Where’d you learn that?

506
00:21:15,681 --> 00:21:16,162
Tiberius: From books.

507
00:21:16,162 --> 00:21:18,028
Matt: The only other bit of information you have

508
00:21:18,028 --> 00:21:19,165
about the whereabouts of her

509
00:21:19,165 --> 00:21:21,039
is that she came here to go into the mine-

510
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:25,034
Apparently a mithril mine where this evil is supposedly brewing.

511
00:21:25,034 --> 00:21:29,274
You heard that the one person who owns

512
00:21:29,274 --> 00:21:31,494
the biggest part of the mithril market

513
00:21:31,494 --> 00:21:32,658
here kind of cornering it name was

514
00:21:32,658 --> 00:21:35,645
the Dwarven Lord Nostoc Greyspine.

515
00:21:35,645 --> 00:21:37,432
That was the only name you had in regards

516
00:21:37,432 --> 00:21:39,227
to this deep earth quarry.

517
00:21:39,227 --> 00:21:41,407
Sam: Greyspine?

518
00:21:41,407 --> 00:21:43,825
Matt: Greyspine- Correct.

519
00:21:44,255 --> 00:21:46,738
Scanlan: We have to go find him, don't we?

520
00:21:46,738 --> 00:21:48,045
Percy: I think before we do anything

521
00:21:48,045 --> 00:21:49,769
we should find a place to sleep.

522
00:21:49,769 --> 00:21:50,889
Tiberius: That's true!

523
00:21:50,889 --> 00:21:52,570
Travis: Oh! We're all jacked up from before, right?

524
00:21:52,570 --> 00:21:53,882
Percy: Wouldn't it be nice just to put

525
00:21:53,882 --> 00:21:55,133
everything down for a little while.

526
00:21:55,133 --> 00:21:56,665
Scanlan: Of course. I've got a lot of - ahem -

527
00:21:56,665 --> 00:21:58,865
booty that I need to... stow.

528
00:21:58,865 --> 00:21:59,914
(all laugh)

529
00:21:59,914 --> 00:22:01,241
Tiberius: Good way to phrase that, Scanlan.

530
00:22:01,241 --> 00:22:03,763
Tiberius: Also I would like to check out any places

531
00:22:03,763 --> 00:22:08,945
where they might have enchanted libraries or what not.

532
00:22:08,945 --> 00:22:10,165
Scanlan: Can you stick with us-

533
00:22:10,165 --> 00:22:12,513
You're the only one that speaks Dwarvish.

534
00:22:12,513 --> 00:22:13,044
Vax: Yes, you're getting ahead of yourself.

535
00:22:13,044 --> 00:22:15,009
Tiberius: I'm just saying put it on the list.

536
00:22:15,009 --> 00:22:15,925
Vax: Let's look around.

537
00:22:15,925 --> 00:22:19,524
Liam: Are there any Dwarves in the vicinity?

538
00:22:19,524 --> 00:22:20,776
Matt: Oh, there are many!

539
00:22:20,776 --> 00:22:24,442
And as you finish this conversation you look about

540
00:22:24,442 --> 00:22:26,546
there are two guards posted nearby wearing

541
00:22:26,546 --> 00:22:29,903
dark, dark crimson and brass chest plates

542
00:22:29,903 --> 00:22:33,048
that have a uniform scar carved across the front.

543
00:22:33,048 --> 00:22:34,892
It’s actually built into the armor itself as a design.

544
00:22:34,892 --> 00:22:36,970
And they're both just staring awkwardly at all of you

545
00:22:36,970 --> 00:22:40,221
arguing in the middle of this entry thoroughfare of Kraghammer.

546
00:22:40,630 --> 00:22:42,585
Vax’ildan: Tiberius, make with the Dwarf-talk, please.

547
00:22:42,585 --> 00:22:45,126
Tiberius: Uhm, hello friends.

548
00:22:45,126 --> 00:22:47,565
My associates and I were looking for a place of lodging

549
00:22:47,565 --> 00:22:51,590
for the night and a place of reputable… reputation.

550
00:22:51,590 --> 00:22:53,125
Matt: One dwarf kind of shouts over to another one-

551
00:22:53,125 --> 00:22:54,809
Guard 1: You hear that, Jepson?!

552
00:22:54,809 --> 00:22:56,985
They're lookin' for a place to stay.

553
00:22:56,985 --> 00:22:58,315
Jepson: Aye, I heard that right.

554
00:22:58,315 --> 00:23:01,529
It's 'bout time we had some new folk in town.

555
00:23:01,529 --> 00:23:04,112
Well if you're looking for a place to stay

556
00:23:04,112 --> 00:23:06,389
I'd say your best bet would be the Pig Pits.

557
00:23:06,389 --> 00:23:08,845
Scanlan: Is that the name of a place?

558
00:23:08,845 --> 00:23:10,645
Jepson: Yes! Certainly! The Pig Pits.

559
00:23:10,645 --> 00:23:11,285
Scanlan: All right...

560
00:23:11,285 --> 00:23:12,828
Jepson: Ask for the Pig Pits-

561
00:23:12,828 --> 00:23:15,945
Vex: Those are actually pig pits, isn't it.

562
00:23:15,945 --> 00:23:17,385
Jepson: Maybe...

563
00:23:17,385 --> 00:23:19,045
Keyleth: I feel like we're being hazed.

564
00:23:19,045 --> 00:23:20,705
Jepson: What?! No, no! Not at all.

565
00:23:20,705 --> 00:23:22,305
Grog: That sounds fine with me.

566
00:23:22,305 --> 00:23:23,265
Liam: This is common?

567
00:23:23,265 --> 00:23:26,645
Matt: This is all in common, yeah.

568
00:23:26,645 --> 00:23:28,169
Scanlan: Which way to the Pig Pits, sir?

569
00:23:28,169 --> 00:23:30,169
Jepson: Pig Pits are that way.

570
00:23:30,169 --> 00:23:32,259
Matt: And he points over the edge and you see down past

571
00:23:32,259 --> 00:23:35,545
the central forge structure in the city at the very,

572
00:23:35,545 --> 00:23:37,165
very bottom nearby what looks like a large

573
00:23:37,165 --> 00:23:38,869
temple that envelops the larger -

574
00:23:38,869 --> 00:23:41,365
or the bottom floor of Kraghammer proper there is indeed

575
00:23:41,365 --> 00:23:46,583
a distant slop of mud where internal livestock are being kept.

576
00:23:46,583 --> 00:23:52,345
Laura: I bring out a piece of gold.

577
00:23:52,345 --> 00:23:54,945
Vex: Please, sir, we're looking for a place to stay

578
00:23:54,945 --> 00:23:57,071
that isn't covered in mud.

579
00:23:57,071 --> 00:23:58,192
Jepson: Well it’s good to see that at least

580
00:23:58,192 --> 00:23:59,345
one of you speaks Dwarvish.

581
00:23:59,345 --> 00:24:01,965
(all laugh)

582
00:24:01,965 --> 00:24:04,658
Matt: Takes the coin, kinks it in his teeth and goes -

583
00:24:04,658 --> 00:24:06,165
Jepson: All right, now if you're looking for a proper place to stay

584
00:24:06,165 --> 00:24:08,185
you're gonna look for the Iron Hearth Tavern.

585
00:24:08,185 --> 00:24:11,145
That is just to your left up that way no more than a half mile.

586
00:24:11,145 --> 00:24:11,839
Keep an eye out.

587
00:24:11,839 --> 00:24:13,325
Listen for the laughter and the people who are

588
00:24:13,325 --> 00:24:14,385
very, very drunk.

589
00:24:14,385 --> 00:24:15,913
That's your best bet.

590
00:24:15,913 --> 00:24:16,401
Vex: Thank you, sir.

591
00:24:16,401 --> 00:24:18,205
Jepson: No worries.

592
00:24:18,205 --> 00:24:19,351
Vex: I like your armor by the way.

593
00:24:19,351 --> 00:24:20,730
Guard: Well thank you kindly.

594
00:24:20,730 --> 00:24:21,265
Travis: Was that a wink?

595
00:24:21,265 --> 00:24:21,882
Laura: It was.

596
00:24:21,882 --> 00:24:24,424
(all laugh)

597
00:24:24,424 --> 00:24:25,786
Liam: That’s all she does.

598
00:24:25,786 --> 00:24:27,500
Vex: That's all I do: I wink at people.

599
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:28,765
Liam: It’s a nervous tick, really.

600
00:24:28,765 --> 00:24:29,326
Matt: It’s a feat she took.

601
00:24:29,326 --> 00:24:31,439
(all laugh)

602
00:24:31,439 --> 00:24:34,945
Matt: You progress to the western side of the Kraghammer rotation

603
00:24:34,945 --> 00:24:38,663
as you kind of curl around the central platform.

604
00:24:38,663 --> 00:24:41,505
Making your way, eventually to the outside of this rather large,

605
00:24:41,505 --> 00:24:43,605
central tavern inn.

606
00:24:43,605 --> 00:24:45,696
As you walk in, you can hear music playing,

607
00:24:45,696 --> 00:24:48,179
you can hear laughter and boastful cheer,

608
00:24:48,179 --> 00:24:50,105
you can hear some arguments in the distance.

609
00:24:50,105 --> 00:24:51,713
You can hear it form a good two or three buildings away.

610
00:24:51,713 --> 00:24:56,405
This is definitely a central social environment here in Kraghammer.

611
00:24:56,405 --> 00:24:58,265
As you walk inside, you-

612
00:24:58,265 --> 00:24:59,912
Let me get some proper tavern music here for you.

613
00:24:59,912 --> 00:25:03,084
Scanlan: Smells in here.

614
00:25:03,084 --> 00:25:05,832
Grog: Drinking territory.

615
00:25:05,832 --> 00:25:07,897
Matt: You hear some loud boisterous

616
00:25:07,897 --> 00:25:09,225
(hearty dwarven laughter)

617
00:25:09,225 --> 00:25:10,945
some drinks being clinked together.

618
00:25:10,945 --> 00:25:12,283
As you walk in the first thing that catches you

619
00:25:12,283 --> 00:25:14,545
is the scent of stale alcohol and the scent

620
00:25:14,545 --> 00:25:15,925
of smoked wood of some kind.

621
00:25:15,925 --> 00:25:18,505
Grog: YES.

622
00:25:18,505 --> 00:25:22,090
Matt: There are tables, most of them in decent condition,

623
00:25:22,090 --> 00:25:24,385
some of them half broken and repaired,

624
00:25:24,385 --> 00:25:27,574
probably from some previous encounter in the bar.

625
00:25:27,574 --> 00:25:31,099
In the center of the room there looks to be a not currently in use,

626
00:25:31,099 --> 00:25:35,285
specifically built brawling circle.

627
00:25:35,285 --> 00:25:38,329
It’s about maybe... It’s about thirty feet by twenty feet.

628
00:25:38,329 --> 00:25:40,865
It’s more of an oval. It’s not in use, currently.

629
00:25:40,865 --> 00:25:42,083
Sam: An octagon?

630
00:25:42,083 --> 00:25:43,700
Matt: Essentially.

631
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:45,777
Liam: How high is the ceiling here? Can Grog fit in here?

632
00:25:45,777 --> 00:25:47,325
Matt: (laughs)

633
00:25:47,325 --> 00:25:48,625
Laura: I was thinking the same thing.

634
00:25:48,625 --> 00:25:49,925
Travis: (Laughing) Oh right, am I like...

635
00:25:49,925 --> 00:25:51,725
Matt: The ceiling actually is considered vaulted ceiling

636
00:25:51,725 --> 00:25:53,138
for dwarves so it runs at about seven feet.

637
00:25:53,138 --> 00:25:54,805
For Grog it’s an uncomfortable...

638
00:25:54,805 --> 00:25:55,665
Like almost scratching your head across the top.

639
00:25:55,665 --> 00:25:57,125
Liam: Just enough.

640
00:25:57,125 --> 00:25:57,985
Grog: Bitch.

641
00:25:57,985 --> 00:25:58,854
Fuck.

642
00:25:58,854 --> 00:26:00,324
Matt: And as you enter about seven or eight of the

643
00:26:00,324 --> 00:26:01,525
nearby dwarves at the front door go:

644
00:26:01,525 --> 00:26:02,565
Dwarves: (hearty laughter)

645
00:26:02,565 --> 00:26:04,365
(laughter stops)

646
00:26:04,365 --> 00:26:05,785
Matt: They just look immediately at the ragtag

647
00:26:05,785 --> 00:26:06,771
non-dwarven group that just kind of stumbled

648
00:26:06,771 --> 00:26:08,185
into the center of the tavern.

649
00:26:08,185 --> 00:26:09,805
Grog: What're you looking at?

650
00:26:09,805 --> 00:26:11,628
Dwarf: It’s not very often we get someone

651
00:26:11,628 --> 00:26:12,566
with that kind of a mug down here.

652
00:26:12,566 --> 00:26:15,225
Let me buy ya a drink, come sit down!

653
00:26:15,225 --> 00:26:16,927
Grog: My kind of people, see ya later!

654
00:26:16,927 --> 00:26:19,605
(all laugh)

655
00:26:19,605 --> 00:26:21,725
Grog: I go grab the drink with the lovely dwarves.

656
00:26:21,725 --> 00:26:23,560
Vex: We grab a table next to the dwarves with Grog.

657
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:26,412
Matt: All right. Both tables next to the table they're at

658
00:26:26,412 --> 00:26:30,253
are completely filled with dwarves.

659
00:26:30,253 --> 00:26:32,150
Liam: I take a sack of gold from my own pocket,

660
00:26:32,150 --> 00:26:34,065
slam it down on the table-

661
00:26:34,065 --> 00:26:35,349
Vex: A sack of gold, are you crazy?!

662
00:26:35,349 --> 00:26:37,027
Vax: Gentlemens and la- uh.

663
00:26:37,027 --> 00:26:37,932
Liam: “Gentlemens and ladies."

664
00:26:37,932 --> 00:26:41,398
Vax: Ladies and gentlemen we are traveling from far away.

665
00:26:41,398 --> 00:26:43,365
We just arrived from Emon.

666
00:26:43,365 --> 00:26:47,149
We are fascinated to see your underground city

667
00:26:47,149 --> 00:26:50,679
and to celebrate the occasion I would like to buy

668
00:26:50,679 --> 00:26:53,589
every dwarf in here a round.

669
00:26:53,589 --> 00:26:54,312
Travis: Shit.

670
00:26:54,312 --> 00:26:55,717
Vax: Bartender!

671
00:26:55,717 --> 00:26:56,505
(Matt turns off music.)

672
00:26:56,505 --> 00:26:58,425
Matt: The music stops. The conversation stops.

673
00:26:58,425 --> 00:27:00,120
(all laugh)

674
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:01,156
Matt: All dwarven eyes turn to the table and

675
00:27:01,156 --> 00:27:03,645
they all turn to a single dwarven woman in the back

676
00:27:03,645 --> 00:27:05,088
who's behind one of the bars,

677
00:27:05,088 --> 00:27:06,437
who has a towel over one arm.

678
00:27:06,437 --> 00:27:07,755
And she's kind of looking around,

679
00:27:07,755 --> 00:27:09,661
she’s staring confused at you and

680
00:27:09,661 --> 00:27:11,305
all eyes are on her, and she goes:

681
00:27:11,305 --> 00:27:14,025
Dwarven Barkeep: Well it's about time someone around here

682
00:27:14,025 --> 00:27:16,292
had some generosity! Certainly, pay upfront.

683
00:27:16,292 --> 00:27:19,205
Drinks all around on this Half-Elven gentleman.

684
00:27:19,205 --> 00:27:19,708
Vax: Let it rain!

685
00:27:19,708 --> 00:27:22,240
(all cheer)

686
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,203
Marisha: Make it rain.

687
00:27:24,203 --> 00:27:25,860
Grog: I would like a cask of ale.

688
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:28,885
Vax: I'll need your largest bowl of ale for this one here.

689
00:27:28,885 --> 00:27:30,158
Gorg: Cask. Cask.

690
00:27:30,158 --> 00:27:30,946
Vax: Cask please.

691
00:27:30,946 --> 00:27:32,385
Grog: -cask of ale. Cask.

692
00:27:32,385 --> 00:27:33,968
Dwarven Barkeep: No worries, Adra's got your back, be right back.

693
00:27:33,968 --> 00:27:35,385
Matt: ...and she wanders off to the back room,

694
00:27:35,385 --> 00:27:36,775
comes back and starts pouring

695
00:27:36,775 --> 00:27:41,438
stein after stein after stein of ale.

696
00:27:41,438 --> 00:27:43,044
Grog: Yeah. Keep going. Looks good.

697
00:27:43,044 --> 00:27:46,505
Matt: You do notice she is definitely the head of this tavern

698
00:27:46,505 --> 00:27:49,006
and all of her barkeeps are male

699
00:27:49,006 --> 00:27:53,135
and seem to be worked rather ragged.

700
00:27:53,135 --> 00:27:53,945
Travis: (To Laura) Do we have her name?

701
00:27:53,945 --> 00:27:55,017
Laura: What was her name?

702
00:27:55,017 --> 00:27:56,189
Scanlan: Excuse me, miss...

703
00:27:56,189 --> 00:27:56,978
Travis: Yeah, get her name.

704
00:27:56,978 --> 00:27:57,942
Scanlan: - you.

705
00:27:57,942 --> 00:27:58,685
Adra: Adra. Yeah?

706
00:27:58,685 --> 00:27:59,485
Scanlan: I'm sorry what was -

707
00:27:59,485 --> 00:28:00,025
Adra: (Slowly) Adra.

708
00:28:00,025 --> 00:28:02,125
Scanlan: Adra! You run a fantastic establishment.

709
00:28:02,125 --> 00:28:03,505
Adra: That's right I do!

710
00:28:03,505 --> 00:28:06,505
Scanlan: Thank you for welcoming us and allowing us to buy this round.

711
00:28:06,505 --> 00:28:08,743
Adra: Of course. Patrons that come and drop coin like that

712
00:28:08,743 --> 00:28:10,777
are welcome any time.

713
00:28:10,777 --> 00:28:13,785
Scanlan: Well, thank you for your hospitality.

714
00:28:13,785 --> 00:28:16,106
Might we inquire about staying here the night?

715
00:28:16,106 --> 00:28:18,025
Do you have an inn with the establishment?

716
00:28:18,025 --> 00:28:19,748
Matt: She reaches below and pulls out a big tome and

717
00:28:19,748 --> 00:28:21,165
starts thumbing through it.

718
00:28:21,165 --> 00:28:23,985
Adra: You know actually we have openings right now

719
00:28:23,985 --> 00:28:25,725
on the second floor.

720
00:28:25,725 --> 00:28:26,585
Scanlan: Several rooms, or just one?

721
00:28:26,585 --> 00:28:27,865
Adra: Do you need them side by side?

722
00:28:27,865 --> 00:28:29,305
Scanlan: That would be nice.

723
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:31,236
Adra: (under her breath) We could pull him there

724
00:28:31,236 --> 00:28:32,334
and push him into room seven...

725
00:28:32,334 --> 00:28:34,825
Scanlan: Something with a little bed for me.

726
00:28:34,825 --> 00:28:36,443
Adra: Giles!

727
00:28:36,443 --> 00:28:39,074
Matt: One of the dwarf barmaid-ers kind of looks over.

728
00:28:39,074 --> 00:28:40,468
Giles: Aye?

729
00:28:40,468 --> 00:28:43,601
Adra: Get Stephson out of his room, move him to the third floor.

730
00:28:43,601 --> 00:28:46,174
We have to open a block for our new guests.

731
00:28:46,174 --> 00:28:48,251
Gile: Egh, fine, fine...

732
00:28:48,251 --> 00:28:48,612
Matt: And the older dwarf kind of stumbles

733
00:28:48,612 --> 00:28:51,398
his way up the stairs begrudgingly.

734
00:28:51,398 --> 00:28:53,351
Adra: Right, so I can get a room for each of you,

735
00:28:53,351 --> 00:28:55,285
we're looking at eight rooms separately,

736
00:28:55,285 --> 00:28:59,164
that will run you per evening about 25 gold pieces.

737
00:28:59,164 --> 00:29:00,545
Does that sound about right?

738
00:29:00,545 --> 00:29:01,805
Grog: Total?

739
00:29:01,805 --> 00:29:04,025
Adra: 25 total pieces.

740
00:29:04,025 --> 00:29:05,105
Scanlan: Oh, okay, okay.

741
00:29:05,105 --> 00:29:06,625
Grog: Right.

742
00:29:06,625 --> 00:29:09,458
Vex: You want to share a room? I think we can probably bunk up.

743
00:29:09,458 --> 00:29:11,105
Keyleth: Yeah! We'll bunk up.

744
00:29:11,105 --> 00:29:14,284
Scanlan: Grog you and me, I can just sleep on your feet.

745
00:29:14,284 --> 00:29:17,759
Vex: Throw down less gold, maybe like, 15 gold then for,

746
00:29:17,759 --> 00:29:19,551
you know, just that amount.

747
00:29:19,551 --> 00:29:22,143
Matt: She visibly deflates a little bit and is like...

748
00:29:22,143 --> 00:29:24,999
Adra: All right, fair enough. fair enough.

749
00:29:24,999 --> 00:29:26,547
Five rooms it is. 15 gold per room.

750
00:29:26,547 --> 00:29:29,245
Scanlan: We're penny pinchers.

751
00:29:29,245 --> 00:29:30,486
Adra: How long do you expect to stay?

752
00:29:30,486 --> 00:29:31,765
Tiberius: At least a few days.

753
00:29:31,765 --> 00:29:33,180
Scanlan: I'd say a week.

754
00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:36,493
Percy: With an indefinite hold, we have business in the city.

755
00:29:36,493 --> 00:29:38,265
Adra: Right! Well how bout we pay the week in advance

756
00:29:38,265 --> 00:29:40,045
and I'll give you a discount?

757
00:29:40,045 --> 00:29:41,402
Tiberius: I love discounts!

758
00:29:41,402 --> 00:29:43,525
Vex: What's the discount?

759
00:29:43,525 --> 00:29:50,365
Keyleth: Wait. I thought we were going to be heading south?

760
00:29:50,365 --> 00:29:51,825
Adra: Let’s see, for five rooms -

761
00:29:51,825 --> 00:29:52,565
Travis: Here comes the haggler.

762
00:29:52,565 --> 00:29:55,305
Adra: Lets say, 100 gold for the week, all five rooms.

763
00:29:55,305 --> 00:29:56,445
Vax: We're pretty flush, I think we can handle it.

764
00:29:56,445 --> 00:29:58,625
Vex: Yes.

765
00:29:58,625 --> 00:29:58,905
Vex: That works.

766
00:29:58,905 --> 00:30:00,098
Grog: All right.

767
00:30:00,098 --> 00:30:01,605
Scanlan: Just go for it.

768
00:30:01,605 --> 00:30:02,225
Percy: This doesn't terrify me.

769
00:30:02,225 --> 00:30:04,405
Vax: Let’s get it. Get the discount.

770
00:30:04,405 --> 00:30:05,805
Vex: I think I did the math wrong.

771
00:30:05,805 --> 00:30:07,265
Travis: I was told there would be no math.

772
00:30:07,265 --> 00:30:08,445
Scanlan: Sounds good!

773
00:30:08,445 --> 00:30:09,565
Travis: We’ll take it!

774
00:30:09,565 --> 00:30:11,345
Vex: Gah! I hate not having a calculator! Fine!

775
00:30:11,345 --> 00:30:12,837
Adra: Ah! Great!

776
00:30:12,837 --> 00:30:14,065
Matt: She pulls back and pulls some keys out

777
00:30:14,065 --> 00:30:15,615
and hands them to the rest of you.

778
00:30:15,615 --> 00:30:17,060
Hands you some paperwork, shows you which rooms

779
00:30:17,060 --> 00:30:18,305
are yours and says:

780
00:30:18,305 --> 00:30:19,810
Adra: You're welcome to stay all ya like,

781
00:30:19,810 --> 00:30:20,892
ask questions, hang about.

782
00:30:20,892 --> 00:30:25,979
Just make sure you don't do anything stupid near the Carvers.

783
00:30:25,979 --> 00:30:30,139
Tiberius: Ooh! Like what? I do things like that all the time!

784
00:30:30,139 --> 00:30:31,845
Vax: Sorry. Our Dwarvish is a little thick. Near the-?

785
00:30:31,845 --> 00:30:33,492
Adra: The Carvers, the Carvers!

786
00:30:33,492 --> 00:30:35,446
Vex: The carvas. Of course.

787
00:30:35,446 --> 00:30:36,225
Adra: The Carvers!

788
00:30:36,225 --> 00:30:37,616
Tiberius: The Converse! Of course!

789
00:30:37,616 --> 00:30:38,987
Scanlan: The Car Verse?

790
00:30:38,987 --> 00:30:39,905
Adra: Is this your first time in Kraghammer?

791
00:30:39,905 --> 00:30:40,965
Everyone: Yes!

792
00:30:40,965 --> 00:30:43,085
Adra: The Carvers are the guard that run this city.

793
00:30:43,085 --> 00:30:44,465
They're the ones that keep the law.

794
00:30:44,465 --> 00:30:44,965
Vex: The scar!

795
00:30:44,965 --> 00:30:46,405
Adra: Yes, the armor, the Carvers!

796
00:30:46,405 --> 00:30:47,845
Grog: Yeah, what is with the scar? I've got one myself.

797
00:30:47,845 --> 00:30:49,588
Tiberius: Oh, the Carvers!

798
00:30:49,588 --> 00:30:51,705
Matt: At which point she kind of leans back and as you reveal

799
00:30:51,705 --> 00:30:54,305
the rather gnarled scar in your chest.

800
00:30:54,305 --> 00:30:56,621
She reels back a bit and two of the nearby dwarves go:

801
00:30:56,621 --> 00:30:57,605
Nearby Dwarves: Yeah!

802
00:30:57,605 --> 00:30:59,285
Matt: And they chug down their drinks.

803
00:30:59,285 --> 00:30:59,584
(all laugh)

804
00:30:59,584 --> 00:31:01,065
Grog: Yeah! More drinking!

805
00:31:01,065 --> 00:31:02,185
Matt: They start showing their scars. And are like:

806
00:31:02,185 --> 00:31:04,585
Dwarf 1: Oh no! I got this one from an iron bolt!

807
00:31:04,585 --> 00:31:07,365
Matt: And they start talking about different creatures they fought.

808
00:31:07,365 --> 00:31:10,825
Adra: All right. Well, the carvers are a bit of a...

809
00:31:10,825 --> 00:31:15,372
how do I put it? A military class in this city.

810
00:31:15,372 --> 00:31:17,893
They run a very tight ship on the streets, so just be careful.

811
00:31:17,893 --> 00:31:19,045
Percy: That shouldn't be a problem.

812
00:31:19,045 --> 00:31:20,565
Scanlan: Thank you.

813
00:31:20,565 --> 00:31:22,925
Percy: Mostly we are just looking for Lord Greyspine if I recall.

814
00:31:22,925 --> 00:31:24,734
We just have business with him.

815
00:31:24,734 --> 00:31:26,207
Vex: Yes, actually we might have business with you,

816
00:31:26,207 --> 00:31:28,629
if you've seen a halfling come through.

817
00:31:28,629 --> 00:31:30,605
Matt: She thinks to herself and goes:

818
00:31:30,605 --> 00:31:32,496
Adra: Hm. There was a halfling woman,

819
00:31:32,496 --> 00:31:33,685
but she was staying at the Firebrook Inn.

820
00:31:33,685 --> 00:31:34,789
Vex: The Firebrook.

821
00:31:34,789 --> 00:31:36,345
Adra: The bottom floor, for a couple of weeks.

822
00:31:36,345 --> 00:31:36,965
Keyleth: In where?

823
00:31:36,965 --> 00:31:38,325
Adra: There was talk about her.

824
00:31:38,325 --> 00:31:39,205
She got in a few fights herself.

825
00:31:39,205 --> 00:31:39,885
Vex: Oh, she did?

826
00:31:39,885 --> 00:31:41,245
Adra: The one with the silver armor? That one?

827
00:31:41,245 --> 00:31:41,959
Vex: Yeah.

828
00:31:41,959 --> 00:31:43,765
Adra: Yeah, she was a firebrand if ever I saw one.

829
00:31:43,765 --> 00:31:44,505
Right up my alley, I like that one.

830
00:31:44,505 --> 00:31:47,688
Percy: How long ago would you say this was?

831
00:31:47,688 --> 00:31:49,045
Adra: Oh, she went through a few weeks,

832
00:31:49,045 --> 00:31:50,745
I haven't seen her recently.

833
00:31:50,745 --> 00:31:52,325
Percy: Thank you. Perfect.

834
00:31:52,325 --> 00:31:56,920
Grog: Is there a champion of the circle of fighting in the tavern?

835
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:58,625
Sam: Oh Jesus...

836
00:31:58,625 --> 00:31:59,937
Grog: Is there a reigning...

837
00:31:59,937 --> 00:32:01,097
Scanlan: Already Grog?!

838
00:32:01,097 --> 00:32:02,625
Grog: Well I have to know these things!

839
00:32:02,625 --> 00:32:04,413
(all laugh)

840
00:32:04,413 --> 00:32:05,926
Taliesin: He has to do something.

841
00:32:05,926 --> 00:32:08,155
Matt: She turns the barrel that she has on the table

842
00:32:08,155 --> 00:32:10,906
towards you a little bit and you can see the actual symbol,

843
00:32:10,906 --> 00:32:13,659
this kind of burned image on the side that says,

844
00:32:13,659 --> 00:32:15,185
"Balgus Brewery." And she goes:

845
00:32:15,185 --> 00:32:17,065
Adra: That'll be Balgus.

846
00:32:17,065 --> 00:32:19,545
The one that supplies us with what you're drinking.

847
00:32:19,545 --> 00:32:21,405
He's the undefeated champion.

848
00:32:21,405 --> 00:32:23,812
Adra: But, I don't think he's quite right to fight at the moment.

849
00:32:23,812 --> 00:32:25,425
Matt: And she points towards the very edge of the bar and

850
00:32:25,425 --> 00:32:27,820
you see one older grizzled dwarf, long gray hair

851
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:29,645
pulled into straight braids in the back.

852
00:32:29,645 --> 00:32:31,092
Big bushy beard that's all shoved up

853
00:32:31,092 --> 00:32:32,545
into his face ‘cause he's asleep,

854
00:32:32,545 --> 00:32:35,985
drunk as a skunk, on the edge of the bar.

855
00:32:35,985 --> 00:32:37,545
Balgus: (snores)

856
00:32:37,545 --> 00:32:39,354
Grog: My type o' dwarf.

857
00:32:39,354 --> 00:32:41,251
Travis: Maybe we'll can use him as a merc later or something.

858
00:32:41,251 --> 00:32:44,565
Grog: All right, another time then, another time.

859
00:32:44,565 --> 00:32:45,849
Scanlan: Another time.

860
00:32:45,849 --> 00:32:47,905
Vax: Save it for a rainy day.

861
00:32:47,905 --> 00:32:48,808
Keyleth: Yeah.

862
00:32:48,808 --> 00:32:49,905
Travis: Does it rain down here?

863
00:32:49,905 --> 00:32:51,285
Taliesin: I don't think they have rainy days.

864
00:32:51,285 --> 00:32:52,608
Adra: You said Greyspine?

865
00:32:52,608 --> 00:32:54,345
Vex: Yes, Greyspine.

866
00:32:54,345 --> 00:32:58,825
Percy: We are looking to set up a meeting.

867
00:32:58,825 --> 00:33:00,627
Adra: Which Greyspine?

868
00:33:00,627 --> 00:33:02,045
Scanlan: Nostoc?

869
00:33:02,045 --> 00:33:07,785
Adra: Nostoc Greyspine… he's definitely a business type one.

870
00:33:07,785 --> 00:33:10,205
Tiberius: Well who's the friendlier Greypsine?

871
00:33:10,205 --> 00:33:11,775
Adra: The friendlier of the types would probably be

872
00:33:11,775 --> 00:33:13,900
the head of House Greyspine.

873
00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:15,740
Keyleth: Wait wait, how many Greypsines are there?

874
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:17,735
Adra: Oh, well there's probably several at this point,

875
00:33:17,735 --> 00:33:19,035
I've lost track.

876
00:33:19,035 --> 00:33:20,605
The family line has being going for a while.

877
00:33:20,605 --> 00:33:22,765
However! Of House Greypsine currently,

878
00:33:22,765 --> 00:33:27,165
Ironkeeper Gradim Greyspine is the head of this entire city.

879
00:33:27,165 --> 00:33:30,632
Voted in 10 years ago actually. He's head of the council.

880
00:33:30,632 --> 00:33:31,825
Marisha: Ironkeeper what?

881
00:33:31,825 --> 00:33:34,385
Adra: Ironkeeper Gradim Greypsine.

882
00:33:34,385 --> 00:33:36,745
Adra: Gradim! You're -

883
00:33:36,745 --> 00:33:37,805
(sigh)

884
00:33:37,805 --> 00:33:40,725
These commoners. Learn to speak the language!

885
00:33:40,725 --> 00:33:45,245
Tiberius: I understood!

886
00:33:45,245 --> 00:33:49,669
Vax: Adra, may I ask, obviously we have no dwarves in our little party.

887
00:33:49,669 --> 00:33:51,347
Adra: Unfortunately.

888
00:33:51,347 --> 00:33:52,585
Vex: Unfortunately for us.

889
00:33:52,585 --> 00:33:55,622
Vax: Sorry, about that. How… You're very welcoming.

890
00:33:55,622 --> 00:33:57,725
I appreciate that.

891
00:33:57,725 --> 00:34:00,704
How welcoming would you say the city is to outsiders?

892
00:34:00,704 --> 00:34:03,265
Vax: Wouldn't we stick out like a sore thumb?

893
00:34:03,265 --> 00:34:07,365
Adra: Probably. As long as you don't do anything stupid.

894
00:34:07,365 --> 00:34:09,985
And as long as you keep the coin flowing,

895
00:34:09,985 --> 00:34:12,825
and as long as you stay to the upper levels.

896
00:34:12,825 --> 00:34:14,871
Adra: The lower levels you get to more of the business.

897
00:34:14,871 --> 00:34:17,145
The miners, the forgers, the foundries.

898
00:34:17,145 --> 00:34:18,341
Vex: The mines.

899
00:34:18,341 --> 00:34:19,485
Adra: When you get to the business areas that's where

900
00:34:19,485 --> 00:34:21,125
the guard gets heavier and that's where folks don't

901
00:34:21,125 --> 00:34:22,983
like you poking near their money.

902
00:34:22,983 --> 00:34:23,845
Tiberius: Yeah!

903
00:34:23,845 --> 00:34:26,551
Scanlan: So the lower levels would have the mithril mines?

904
00:34:26,551 --> 00:34:27,731
Adra: THE mithril mine, aye.

905
00:34:27,731 --> 00:34:28,664
Scanlan: There's one?

906
00:34:28,664 --> 00:34:29,505
Adra: There is one now. It's all been,

907
00:34:29,505 --> 00:34:31,965
and has been for quite some time,

908
00:34:31,965 --> 00:34:34,158
completely helmed up and run by house Greypsine.

909
00:34:34,158 --> 00:34:37,609
The Keystone Quarry is what you're looking for.

910
00:34:37,609 --> 00:34:38,921
Vax: We're not really interested in that.

911
00:34:38,921 --> 00:34:41,033
We just want to see the city. Our business is elsewhere.

912
00:34:41,033 --> 00:34:42,745
Adra: Yeah, I would not recommend it.

913
00:34:42,745 --> 00:34:44,885
Not without proper business credentials on that.

914
00:34:44,885 --> 00:34:46,769
You'll end up being questioned very heavily.

915
00:34:46,769 --> 00:34:48,401
Vax: Sounds like a dirty business anyway.

916
00:34:48,401 --> 00:34:49,545
Vex: Right.

917
00:34:49,545 --> 00:34:51,087
Grog: Yeah, you want to stay away from those miners Scanlan,

918
00:34:51,087 --> 00:34:52,685
that's a dirty business.

919
00:34:52,685 --> 00:34:54,087
Adra: She gives you a look almost like

920
00:34:54,087 --> 00:34:55,265
it was a slightly racist statement,

921
00:34:55,265 --> 00:34:59,315
but then passes it off 'cause you paid her a lot of coin today.

922
00:34:59,315 --> 00:35:01,127
Marisha: So racist.

923
00:35:01,127 --> 00:35:02,205
Taliesin: That's a little racist.

924
00:35:02,205 --> 00:35:02,883
Vex: So...

925
00:35:02,883 --> 00:35:04,145
Vex: No-stock. Nostoc?

926
00:35:04,145 --> 00:35:04,780
Vax: Nostoc.

927
00:35:04,780 --> 00:35:06,705
Vex: Nostoc Grey… spine.

928
00:35:06,705 --> 00:35:08,025
Adra: Yes.

929
00:35:08,025 --> 00:35:09,165
Vex: You said that he's kind of a - ?

930
00:35:09,165 --> 00:35:11,246
Adra: Oh, there's a reason he's the one put in charge of the mines

931
00:35:11,246 --> 00:35:12,481
and the businesses and the foundries.

932
00:35:12,481 --> 00:35:15,067
Vex: Oh. Where is he located, exactly?

933
00:35:15,067 --> 00:35:18,036
Adra: Well, if he's not home, at the actual Greyspine Manor

934
00:35:18,036 --> 00:35:20,316
which is a sprawling house.

935
00:35:20,316 --> 00:35:22,165
It contains all the ones who live there.

936
00:35:22,165 --> 00:35:22,665
Vex: Oh, right.

937
00:35:22,665 --> 00:35:27,987
Adra: Ah. He's probably down at the actual, at the, what is it -

938
00:35:27,987 --> 00:35:31,545
Matt: Pardon - bear with me - consult my notes!

939
00:35:31,545 --> 00:35:34,266
Adra: He's probably down by the Greyspine quarry itself,

940
00:35:34,266 --> 00:35:36,245
keeping an eye on the business there.

941
00:35:36,245 --> 00:35:39,616
Matt: There's a nearby dwarf, at this point, kind of near,

942
00:35:39,616 --> 00:35:41,123
he's having a few drinks; goes -

943
00:35:41,123 --> 00:35:44,395
Drinking Dwarf: Ah, Greyspine, there's been troubles round there!

944
00:35:44,395 --> 00:35:46,744
Apparently, a friend of mine works there.

945
00:35:46,744 --> 00:35:48,886
Got a big, nasty scar last week.

946
00:35:48,886 --> 00:35:51,196
Wouldn't even pay 'im for his time off ta heal.

947
00:35:51,196 --> 00:35:52,665
It's bullshit!

948
00:35:52,665 --> 00:35:54,045
Matt: He slams his drink down on the table.

949
00:35:54,045 --> 00:35:55,529
Scanlan: Down at the quarry?

950
00:35:55,529 --> 00:35:56,225
Drinking Dwarf: Aye.

951
00:35:56,225 --> 00:35:58,959
Keyleth: How did your friend get this nasty cut?

952
00:35:58,959 --> 00:36:00,354
Drinking Dwarf: He works there!

953
00:36:00,354 --> 00:36:02,381
Said there was things pourin' out of the caves.

954
00:36:02,381 --> 00:36:04,285
Vex: (gasp) What kind of things?

955
00:36:04,285 --> 00:36:05,025
Drinking Dwarf: Goblins and the like!

956
00:36:05,025 --> 00:36:06,265
Vex: Goblins?

957
00:36:06,265 --> 00:36:06,765
Scanlan: Goblins?

958
00:36:06,765 --> 00:36:07,905
Drinking Dwarf: Ah, goblins are nothin’.

959
00:36:07,905 --> 00:36:08,739
Vex: Of course not.

960
00:36:08,739 --> 00:36:10,688
Drinking Dwarf: Seems there's something other than goblins

961
00:36:10,688 --> 00:36:11,942
pokin' out through this hole.

962
00:36:11,942 --> 00:36:13,565
Just sayin', that business is in for a serious problem

963
00:36:13,565 --> 00:36:15,225
if it doesn't change.

964
00:36:15,225 --> 00:36:17,025
Vex: Does your friend ever have drinks here?

965
00:36:17,025 --> 00:36:19,091
Drinking Dwarf: No. He's been sober for 2 years.

966
00:36:19,091 --> 00:36:21,354
We're not friends anymore.

967
00:36:21,354 --> 00:36:22,185
Keyleth: Oh.

968
00:36:22,185 --> 00:36:23,905
Matt: Kind of tugs on his beard a little bit.

969
00:36:23,905 --> 00:36:26,123
Keyleth: I'm... sorry. I think.

970
00:36:26,123 --> 00:36:27,285
Scanlan: A lot to process.

971
00:36:27,285 --> 00:36:28,725
Matt: He pours another drink. At which point,

972
00:36:28,725 --> 00:36:30,345
Adra slaps his hand and says-

973
00:36:30,345 --> 00:36:32,656
Adra: Pay that. He bought one round!

974
00:36:32,656 --> 00:36:35,205
Matt: He finishes his drink and walks away.

975
00:36:35,205 --> 00:36:37,014
Tiberius: Excuse me, uh, one thing Adra, are there any

976
00:36:37,014 --> 00:36:39,485
mystics in this particular town, that study any arcane arts?

977
00:36:39,485 --> 00:36:41,805
Adra: Of course! What, you think dwarves

978
00:36:41,805 --> 00:36:43,705
are just the baseline folks who brawl each other?

979
00:36:43,705 --> 00:36:45,194
Tiberius: Well, I haven't met any-

980
00:36:45,194 --> 00:36:48,175
Keyleth: So many racist comments. Jeez!

981
00:36:48,175 --> 00:36:50,658
Adra: What you're looking for is house Thunderbrand.

982
00:36:50,658 --> 00:36:52,425
They are the ones who, by blood,

983
00:36:52,425 --> 00:36:55,225
have the arcane arts in their family line.

984
00:36:55,225 --> 00:36:56,728
Tiberius: Interesting.

985
00:36:56,728 --> 00:36:59,370
Adra: They run most of the enchantment process in the city,

986
00:36:59,370 --> 00:37:01,127
they also train - they call it train,

987
00:37:01,127 --> 00:37:04,165
some of us call it more 'indoctrination' -

988
00:37:04,165 --> 00:37:05,567
But, they're definitely the focus of

989
00:37:05,567 --> 00:37:07,565
all arcane arts here in Kraghammer.

990
00:37:07,565 --> 00:37:09,465
Tiberius: Thank you.

991
00:37:09,465 --> 00:37:12,843
Scanlan: Thank you for your time, Adra.

992
00:37:12,843 --> 00:37:13,093
Adra: Of course!

993
00:37:13,093 --> 00:37:15,836
Scanlan: Carry on with your evening, we'll seek you out

994
00:37:15,836 --> 00:37:17,725
if we have any more questions.

995
00:37:17,725 --> 00:37:19,327
Adra: Certainly. Now if you don't mind -

996
00:37:19,327 --> 00:37:21,185
Matt: She scoots you aside, and you see a line,

997
00:37:21,185 --> 00:37:21,857
a queue of dwarves behind her,

998
00:37:21,857 --> 00:37:22,844
with their empty cups,

999
00:37:22,844 --> 00:37:26,373
waiting to get to her to fill up the drinks that you bought.

1000
00:37:26,373 --> 00:37:27,505
Marisha: Oh, that's - we did promise that.

1001
00:37:27,505 --> 00:37:29,125
Travis: Oh, right.

1002
00:37:29,125 --> 00:37:30,535
Vax: Enjoy, gentlemen! And lady.

1003
00:37:30,535 --> 00:37:31,755
Laura: What time of day is it?

1004
00:37:31,755 --> 00:37:33,780
Matt: Best that you can tell, inside - you can't.

1005
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:34,505
Laura: Oh, right.

1006
00:37:34,505 --> 00:37:39,025
Matt: But you just arrived, probably around 3 or 4 in the afternoon,

1007
00:37:39,025 --> 00:37:41,324
so you're probably pushing sunset right about now.

1008
00:37:41,324 --> 00:37:43,065
Vex: Do dwarves carry the same schedule?

1009
00:37:43,065 --> 00:37:44,469
Keyleth: I dunno.

1010
00:37:44,469 --> 00:37:45,825
Vex: Does anyone know?

1011
00:37:45,825 --> 00:37:47,045
Percy: There's only one way to find out.

1012
00:37:47,045 --> 00:37:47,890
Vex: Does anyone know -

1013
00:37:47,890 --> 00:37:50,025
Matt: Make an intelligence check!

1014
00:37:50,025 --> 00:37:51,050
Travis: Oh! Roll it! You're the first one.

1015
00:37:51,050 --> 00:37:52,365
Liam: First time rolling.

1016
00:37:52,365 --> 00:37:53,322
Nice!

1017
00:37:53,322 --> 00:37:56,298
Laura: 18, plus, what is that? Investigation? Or insight?

1018
00:37:56,298 --> 00:37:57,936
Matt: This would be just a straight intelligence roll on this one,

1019
00:37:57,936 --> 00:37:59,992
so just, your general knowledge of dwarves.

1020
00:37:59,992 --> 00:38:01,159
Laura: Oh. 20 then.

1021
00:38:01,159 --> 00:38:03,065
Matt: 20. (Italian accent) That's not too bad!

1022
00:38:03,065 --> 00:38:06,325
That's not too bad. In your experience, you know dwarves,

1023
00:38:06,325 --> 00:38:07,337
depending on their lifestyle

1024
00:38:07,337 --> 00:38:09,812
and what they do for a living, their clocks can run differently,

1025
00:38:09,812 --> 00:38:13,766
but for the most part, they run in tandem with most other races.

1026
00:38:13,766 --> 00:38:16,865
Just because it makes it easier for dealing with outside forces.

1027
00:38:16,865 --> 00:38:19,544
But, like I said, it's very variable.

1028
00:38:19,544 --> 00:38:22,725
There is nob set, locked time of: this is morning, this is evening,

1029
00:38:23,536 --> 00:38:24,505
they just kind of sleep when they need to

1030
00:38:24,505 --> 00:38:25,700
and wake up when they need to.

1031
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:28,096
Laura: All right. Good to know.

1032
00:38:28,096 --> 00:38:29,566
Marisha: It's like living in Alaska.

1033
00:38:29,566 --> 00:38:30,256
Laura: Right!

1034
00:38:30,256 --> 00:38:30,756
Matt: Kind of.

1035
00:38:30,756 --> 00:38:32,035
Matt: Dwarven Alaska.

1036
00:38:32,035 --> 00:38:32,403
Vax: Where?

1037
00:38:32,403 --> 00:38:33,336
Marisha: Dwarven Alaska.

1038
00:38:33,336 --> 00:38:34,592
Taliesin: Gnome Alaska.

1039
00:38:34,592 --> 00:38:37,776
Travis: Should we go to the Fire Brick Inn?

1040
00:38:37,776 --> 00:38:41,912
Vex: I think, yes. Two things.

1041
00:38:41,912 --> 00:38:42,162
Scanlan: Yes, fellows, what should we do?

1042
00:38:42,162 --> 00:38:43,196
Vex: Check out the Fire Brick Inn, yes -

1043
00:38:43,196 --> 00:38:44,815
That was where Lady Kima was staying.

1044
00:38:44,815 --> 00:38:45,836
Vex: And also, I think somebody should

1045
00:38:45,836 --> 00:38:46,982
run reconnaissance on Greyspine Manor.

1046
00:38:46,982 --> 00:38:47,958
Grog: Like stealth, you mean?

1047
00:38:47,958 --> 00:38:49,266
Vax: Yes. I don't think we should try to go directly

1048
00:38:49,266 --> 00:38:50,036
to the mines and find Nostoc.

1049
00:38:50,036 --> 00:38:50,536
Vex: No.

1050
00:38:50,536 --> 00:38:51,216
Scanlan: Agreed.

1051
00:38:51,216 --> 00:38:54,168
Vax: No, I think maybe we should enlist

1052
00:38:54,168 --> 00:38:55,564
the help of a dwarf here in the city

1053
00:38:55,564 --> 00:38:57,456
to introduce us to Nostoc.

1054
00:38:57,456 --> 00:38:59,117
I mean, we're not trying to raise hell,

1055
00:38:59,117 --> 00:39:01,622
or bring down a thousand dwarves upon us.

1056
00:39:01,622 --> 00:39:03,916
Percy: And there's no sense attempting to be subtle.

1057
00:39:03,916 --> 00:39:05,365
Scanlan: Although, that does sound fun.

1058
00:39:05,365 --> 00:39:06,776
Percy: Everyone’s going to know that we're here,

1059
00:39:06,776 --> 00:39:08,716
and what we're looking for by morning.

1060
00:39:08,716 --> 00:39:09,256
Keyleth: Yeah.

1061
00:39:09,256 --> 00:39:10,911
Grog: Why don't we get old Drunky Greybeard that's got his

1062
00:39:10,911 --> 00:39:12,196
face down on the bar to do it?

1063
00:39:12,196 --> 00:39:13,760
Vex: Yeah, but he's very- Well, let's ask him.

1064
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:16,340
Maybe he's drunk enough to help us.

1065
00:39:16,340 --> 00:39:18,036
Saddle up, Grog!

1066
00:39:18,036 --> 00:39:18,561
Grog: Me?

1067
00:39:18,561 --> 00:39:19,976
Vex: People seem to like you here.

1068
00:39:19,976 --> 00:39:21,126
Grog: Yeah, but I'm really- aw, that's true.

1069
00:39:21,126 --> 00:39:22,538
Vax: You're the connoisseur.

1070
00:39:22,538 --> 00:39:23,716
Grog: Maybe I'll part my armour, so he can see the scar.

1071
00:39:23,716 --> 00:39:24,696
Vex: Go show him your scar, see what he does.

1072
00:39:24,696 --> 00:39:25,558
Grog: Post up on the bar?

1073
00:39:25,558 --> 00:39:26,838
Keyleth: Take him a drink!

1074
00:39:26,838 --> 00:39:27,536
Percy: Let him touch it.

1075
00:39:27,536 --> 00:39:28,636
Grog: All right.

1076
00:39:28,636 --> 00:39:28,923
Keyleth: Take him a drink.

1077
00:39:28,923 --> 00:39:29,176
Vex: Yes, take him a drink. A very large drink.

1078
00:39:29,176 --> 00:39:31,936
Grog: I would like to get a very large -

1079
00:39:31,936 --> 00:39:34,336
the largest goblet you have of ale,

1080
00:39:34,336 --> 00:39:36,516
and I would like to go over to, what was his name?

1081
00:39:36,516 --> 00:39:38,076
Bulbous?

1082
00:39:38,076 --> 00:39:39,936
Matt: (laughs) Balgus.

1083
00:39:39,936 --> 00:39:40,804
Grog: Balgus.

1084
00:39:40,804 --> 00:39:42,256
Everyone: (repeating) Balgus.

1085
00:39:42,256 --> 00:39:43,576
Grog: I had it right.

1086
00:39:43,576 --> 00:39:44,791
Matt: Close.

1087
00:39:44,791 --> 00:39:46,806
Grog: Balgus. And I would like to, um-

1088
00:39:46,806 --> 00:39:48,316
Sam: I'm coming with Grog.

1089
00:39:48,316 --> 00:39:52,696
Grog: Yes, yes. And I would like to go up and put my scar,

1090
00:39:52,696 --> 00:39:53,896
and post up on the bar and-

1091
00:39:53,896 --> 00:39:55,687
(clears throat dramatically)

1092
00:39:55,687 --> 00:39:57,916
Balgus: (snores)

1093
00:39:57,916 --> 00:39:59,236
Liam: (laughs)

1094
00:39:59,236 --> 00:40:02,176
Grog: (clears throat even more dramatically)

1095
00:40:02,176 --> 00:40:03,656
Laura: (Laughs)

1096
00:40:03,656 --> 00:40:05,736
Scanlan: I take out my flute and

1097
00:40:05,736 --> 00:40:07,142
I play a little healing words spell.

1098
00:40:07,142 --> 00:40:09,895
And try to heal him of his drunkenness.

1099
00:40:09,895 --> 00:40:11,436
Laura: Just a little of his drunkenness,

1100
00:40:11,436 --> 00:40:12,376
not all of his drunkenness.

1101
00:40:12,376 --> 00:40:14,196
Travis: He likes him drunk, so maybe like, half.

1102
00:40:14,196 --> 00:40:16,485
Matt: All right, so, as you play your tune,

1103
00:40:16,485 --> 00:40:17,916
a beautiful little tune that saunters through the air.

1104
00:40:17,916 --> 00:40:18,696
Sam: (makes flute sounds)

1105
00:40:18,696 --> 00:40:20,696
Matt: The magical energies emanate from the notes you make,

1106
00:40:20,696 --> 00:40:23,116
kind of drift into his torso; you can see a slight glow and he -

1107
00:40:23,116 --> 00:40:26,339
Balgus: (grumbling, waking up noises)

1108
00:40:26,339 --> 00:40:28,655
Where's that blasted music coming from?

1109
00:40:28,655 --> 00:40:29,536
(all laugh)

1110
00:40:29,536 --> 00:40:31,216
Matt: His hand goes out and paws towards the flute.

1111
00:40:31,216 --> 00:40:35,116
Scanlan: Huh, I don't know where that was coming from.

1112
00:40:35,116 --> 00:40:38,587
Grog: I'm sorry, sorry to disturb you, your name is of

1113
00:40:38,587 --> 00:40:40,875
great repute around these parts.

1114
00:40:40,875 --> 00:40:42,133
Matt: And as he wipes a globule of drool that's kind of

1115
00:40:42,133 --> 00:40:44,282
crusted into his beard.

1116
00:40:44,282 --> 00:40:46,916
Balgus: Aye, you've bothered me nap.

1117
00:40:46,916 --> 00:40:49,413
What d'you want from Balgus?

1118
00:40:49,413 --> 00:40:51,016
Grog: We were wonderin' if we might, perchance,

1119
00:40:51,016 --> 00:40:54,535
acquire your knowledge about town,

1120
00:40:54,535 --> 00:40:56,206
uh, for a bit of a search -

1121
00:40:56,206 --> 00:40:58,130
Vex: (whispered) Talk to him about fighting first.

1122
00:40:58,130 --> 00:41:01,759
Grog: Right, I hear you're a good fighter.

1123
00:41:01,759 --> 00:41:03,731
You look strong.

1124
00:41:03,731 --> 00:41:06,516
Balgus: I've 'eard the same.

1125
00:41:06,516 --> 00:41:08,016
Grog: Right, um -

1126
00:41:08,016 --> 00:41:08,796
(clears throat)

1127
00:41:08,796 --> 00:41:10,975
How often do you get challengers in this tavern?

1128
00:41:10,975 --> 00:41:12,566
Vax: Careful.

1129
00:41:12,566 --> 00:41:15,076
Balgus: (sighs) Not as often as I get woken up from my sleep.

1130
00:41:15,076 --> 00:41:17,736
Which is never.

1131
00:41:17,736 --> 00:41:20,236
Because only stupid people do that.

1132
00:41:20,236 --> 00:41:21,940
Vex: Lost cause. Abandon ship, abandon ship!

1133
00:41:21,940 --> 00:41:23,956
Grog: Right. I have an intelligence of six,

1134
00:41:23,956 --> 00:41:25,798
I know what I'm doing.

1135
00:41:25,798 --> 00:41:27,386
Vex: Okay.

1136
00:41:27,386 --> 00:41:28,492
(all laugh)

1137
00:41:28,492 --> 00:41:29,516
Grog: There is a very pretty lady over there,

1138
00:41:29,516 --> 00:41:30,796
with slightly pointy ears -

1139
00:41:30,796 --> 00:41:32,536
(to Vex) I'm talking about you - (to Keyleth) or you -

1140
00:41:32,536 --> 00:41:35,336
There's two of them! And they were actually wanting to ask you

1141
00:41:35,336 --> 00:41:37,996
a question if you wouldn't mind.

1142
00:41:37,996 --> 00:41:39,956
Matt: Make a persuasion roll.

1143
00:41:39,956 --> 00:41:40,436
Travis: Me?!

1144
00:41:40,436 --> 00:41:41,647
Sam: Oh, shit.

1145
00:41:41,647 --> 00:41:42,347
Marisha: What?

1146
00:41:42,347 --> 00:41:43,176
Sam: Why is he doing this?

1147
00:41:43,176 --> 00:41:44,596
Laura: Why would you throw this to us?

1148
00:41:44,596 --> 00:41:45,919
Marisha: I know. Why didn't - because you were failing?

1149
00:41:45,919 --> 00:41:47,158
Travis: Because I was either gonna fight him

1150
00:41:47,158 --> 00:41:48,332
or I was gonna throw boobs at him,

1151
00:41:48,332 --> 00:41:49,166
and I went with boobs.

1152
00:41:49,166 --> 00:41:50,396
Laura: All right, all right.

1153
00:41:50,396 --> 00:41:51,020
Marisha: He realized he was sinking.

1154
00:41:51,020 --> 00:41:52,596
Matt: That’s level 10 you get that, by the way.

1155
00:41:52,596 --> 00:41:54,522
Throw Boobs.

1156
00:41:54,522 --> 00:41:55,741
Laura: Persuasion.

1157
00:41:55,741 --> 00:41:56,836
Laura: Oh! Good roll.

1158
00:41:56,836 --> 00:41:58,656
Travis: 19!

1159
00:41:58,656 --> 00:41:59,656
Laura: Woo!

1160
00:41:59,656 --> 00:42:00,121
Matt: 19?

1161
00:42:00,121 --> 00:42:01,336
Taliesin: Yeah.

1162
00:42:01,336 --> 00:42:06,516
Matt: He takes a moment, and grabs the drink that you

1163
00:42:06,516 --> 00:42:07,716
prepared from his hand and goes -

1164
00:42:07,716 --> 00:42:09,173
(gulps)

1165
00:42:09,173 --> 00:42:10,913
Grog: Nice one.

1166
00:42:10,913 --> 00:42:13,077
Balgus: You've got five minutes.

1167
00:42:13,077 --> 00:42:14,176
Matt: Then he kind of stretches his back a bit.

1168
00:42:14,176 --> 00:42:16,576
You can see this like, gnarled

1169
00:42:16,576 --> 00:42:19,504
hunch that he holds in his physical posture, flexes it a bit,

1170
00:42:19,504 --> 00:42:21,398
and now you can see the rippling muscles that show beneath his tunic.

1171
00:42:21,398 --> 00:42:22,685
Grog: Sweet.

1172
00:42:22,685 --> 00:42:23,612
Matt: This is a built dwarf.

1173
00:42:23,612 --> 00:42:24,956
You don't know what past he's had,

1174
00:42:24,956 --> 00:42:27,772
moving boulders or forging crazy iron shit,

1175
00:42:27,772 --> 00:42:30,556
but there's a reason this guy has a reputation.

1176
00:42:30,556 --> 00:42:31,956
And he stands up off of his stool,

1177
00:42:31,956 --> 00:42:33,796
which you can now hear crack with the weight of a dwarf,

1178
00:42:33,796 --> 00:42:35,976
which are made for normal dwarves.

1179
00:42:35,976 --> 00:42:37,276
This guy is solid muscle.

1180
00:42:37,276 --> 00:42:39,646
And he saunters over, looks about

1181
00:42:39,646 --> 00:42:42,156
for a second, almost like he's looking for his next target.

1182
00:42:42,156 --> 00:42:44,778
Sees the pointy ears, sees the pointy ears, and goes

1183
00:42:44,778 --> 00:42:46,316
(sighs)

1184
00:42:46,316 --> 00:42:48,956
and just saunters up to the table, slams his hand down.

1185
00:42:48,956 --> 00:42:50,147
Keyleth: Why is he coming towards us?

1186
00:42:50,147 --> 00:42:51,616
Grog: ‘Cause I told him to.

1187
00:42:51,616 --> 00:42:52,602
'Cause you're supposed to ask him -

1188
00:42:52,602 --> 00:42:54,280
Scanlan: Boobs. Boobs!

1189
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:55,256
Vax: Steady as she goes ladies.

1190
00:42:55,256 --> 00:42:55,756
Matt: He sits down.

1191
00:42:55,756 --> 00:42:57,376
Keyleth: (whispered to Vex) You're better at this than I am.

1192
00:42:57,376 --> 00:43:00,816
Balgus: You called for Balgus, why?

1193
00:43:00,816 --> 00:43:03,303
Vex: Oh! Hello Balgus.

1194
00:43:03,303 --> 00:43:04,813
Keyleth: Hi… Balgus.

1195
00:43:04,813 --> 00:43:07,696
Vex: You're so… we just heard you're so…

1196
00:43:07,696 --> 00:43:09,793
impressive and masculine.

1197
00:43:09,793 --> 00:43:10,416
Keyleth: Yes!

1198
00:43:10,416 --> 00:43:12,456
Vex: We really wanted to talk to you.

1199
00:43:12,456 --> 00:43:13,793
Orion: I use my Earring of Whisper to Vex.

1200
00:43:13,793 --> 00:43:15,912
Tiberius: Cool it, cool it down.

1201
00:43:15,912 --> 00:43:17,216
Vex: Oh sh- okay.

1202
00:43:17,216 --> 00:43:18,055
Tiberius: Calm down. Not so sexy.

1203
00:43:18,055 --> 00:43:23,399
Marisha: I reach out and I stroke his bicep.

1204
00:43:23,399 --> 00:43:24,736
Sam: Oh, Jesus.

1205
00:43:24,736 --> 00:43:26,095
Marisha: Because I can't hear that.

1206
00:43:26,095 --> 00:43:27,079
Orion: I use it again, I'm like -

1207
00:43:27,079 --> 00:43:28,296
Tiberius: What are you doing? Keyleth, stop it.

1208
00:43:28,296 --> 00:43:30,356
Vax: I disagree, heat it up, heat it up.

1209
00:43:30,356 --> 00:43:32,536
Matt: (To Marisha) Make a persuasion check.

1210
00:43:32,536 --> 00:43:33,836
Travis: Roll well, roll well.

1211
00:43:33,836 --> 00:43:34,736
Laura: Roll so good.

1212
00:43:34,736 --> 00:43:35,846
Taliesin: Roll like you mean it.

1213
00:43:35,846 --> 00:43:37,281
Marisha: I'm really low in charisma. I'm really awkward.

1214
00:43:37,281 --> 00:43:39,176
Uh, persuasion.

1215
00:43:39,176 --> 00:43:40,656
Matt: (in Balgus voice) Roll your persuasion.

1216
00:43:40,656 --> 00:43:41,996
Vax: Grog, pass the popcorn.

1217
00:43:41,996 --> 00:43:42,496
Taliesin: (groans)

1218
00:43:42,496 --> 00:43:43,576
Laura: Oh no, what was it?

1219
00:43:43,576 --> 00:43:44,936
Marisha: I rolled a two?

1220
00:43:44,936 --> 00:43:46,249
Matt: Plus?

1221
00:43:46,249 --> 00:43:48,276
Marisha: Plus my persuasion of zero,

1222
00:43:48,276 --> 00:43:51,116
because I have a shitty Charisma.

1223
00:43:51,116 --> 00:43:52,456
Scanlan: Why am I not talking to him?

1224
00:43:52,456 --> 00:43:53,956
Matt: As your arm reaches for his bicep-

1225
00:43:53,956 --> 00:43:55,431
Marisha: I didn't say anything, I just touched him!

1226
00:43:55,431 --> 00:43:56,976
Matt: As your arm reaches for his bicep his hand with -

1227
00:43:56,976 --> 00:44:00,484
belying his grumpy, half-asleep haze -

1228
00:44:00,484 --> 00:44:01,816
with unnatural speed reaches out and just

1229
00:44:01,816 --> 00:44:03,163
(slap noise)

1230
00:44:03,163 --> 00:44:05,383
slaps your hand to the side. Not painfully, but just -

1231
00:44:05,383 --> 00:44:08,296
Balgus: No touching the drunk dwarf.

1232
00:44:08,296 --> 00:44:12,276
Keyleth: Sorry.

1233
00:44:12,276 --> 00:44:13,506
Vex: Sorry about my friend Balgus.

1234
00:44:13,506 --> 00:44:15,154
She's just so impressed with your…

1235
00:44:15,154 --> 00:44:16,199
muscles.

1236
00:44:16,199 --> 00:44:18,256
We've heard amazing things about you here.

1237
00:44:18,256 --> 00:44:20,176
Balgus: Have you?

1238
00:44:20,176 --> 00:44:21,381
Vex: We have.

1239
00:44:21,381 --> 00:44:22,858
Balgus: Tell me, what have you heard?

1240
00:44:22,858 --> 00:44:26,059
Vex: We've heard that no fighter can match your skill.

1241
00:44:26,059 --> 00:44:27,073
Balgus: You've heard correct.

1242
00:44:27,073 --> 00:44:30,036
Vex: We've heard that you know more

1243
00:44:30,036 --> 00:44:32,434
about this town than anyone else.

1244
00:44:32,434 --> 00:44:36,146
Balgus: I've been around a bit, yeah.

1245
00:44:36,146 --> 00:44:38,056
Vex: Yeah. I bet nobody knows more about

1246
00:44:38,056 --> 00:44:39,734
the Greyspines than you do

1247
00:44:39,734 --> 00:44:42,251
and they've been around a long time.

1248
00:44:42,251 --> 00:44:44,956
Balgus: That core of, political ass minds is what they are.

1249
00:44:44,956 --> 00:44:46,176
Scanlan: Assmanes?

1250
00:44:46,176 --> 00:44:47,696
Balgus: Not key to them - ass minds.

1251
00:44:47,696 --> 00:44:48,791
Scanlan: Oh, ok.

1252
00:44:48,791 --> 00:44:49,948
Keyleth: Ass mines?

1253
00:44:49,948 --> 00:44:50,759
Balgus: They've got minds of an ass.

1254
00:44:50,759 --> 00:44:52,138
Vex: Yes, yes, ass minds.

1255
00:44:52,138 --> 00:44:54,681
Keyleth: Oh, I thought you meant like, mines that ex-

1256
00:44:54,681 --> 00:44:56,696
Sorry. Go ahead.

1257
00:44:56,696 --> 00:44:58,979
No, ass minds. Yes, they have ass minds.

1258
00:44:58,979 --> 00:45:00,668
Liam: You rolled a two, be quiet.

1259
00:45:00,668 --> 00:45:01,836
Balgus: The Greyspines are no friend of mine.

1260
00:45:01,836 --> 00:45:02,716
Vex: No, I've heard they're terrible.

1261
00:45:02,716 --> 00:45:04,116
What do you do, Balgus?

1262
00:45:04,116 --> 00:45:07,168
Balgus: What do I do? I own the brewery in town!

1263
00:45:07,168 --> 00:45:08,056
Vex: (gasp) You do?

1264
00:45:08,056 --> 00:45:09,207
Balgus: The only one.

1265
00:45:09,207 --> 00:45:10,136
Vex: The best brewery?

1266
00:45:10,136 --> 00:45:11,196
Balgus: The only! Of course it's the best!

1267
00:45:11,196 --> 00:45:13,395
I've put everyone out of business.

1268
00:45:13,395 --> 00:45:15,476
We export to most of Tal'Dorei.

1269
00:45:15,476 --> 00:45:17,396
Grog: You are my new favorite person.

1270
00:45:17,396 --> 00:45:18,393
Vex: This ale is amazing, that I'm drinking right now.

1271
00:45:18,393 --> 00:45:20,696
Balgus: Damn right it is!

1272
00:45:20,696 --> 00:45:22,136
Matt: You set it down and he takes it from your hand a little bit and

1273
00:45:22,136 --> 00:45:24,621
takes a sip himself and sets it down again.

1274
00:45:24,621 --> 00:45:25,250
Balgus: (inhales deeply)

1275
00:45:25,250 --> 00:45:25,982
(spits)

1276
00:45:25,982 --> 00:45:28,016
(all laugh)

1277
00:45:28,016 --> 00:45:33,308
Keyleth: So it seems that you aren't challenged often

1278
00:45:33,308 --> 00:45:35,316
in business and in fighting.

1279
00:45:35,316 --> 00:45:38,787
Orion: I saunter over.

1280
00:45:38,787 --> 00:45:39,999
Tiberius: Hello!

1281
00:45:39,999 --> 00:45:40,836
Sam: Oh Jesus.

1282
00:45:40,836 --> 00:45:41,911
Laura: Oh god.

1283
00:45:41,911 --> 00:45:43,456
Tiberius: My name is Tiberius Stormwind!

1284
00:45:43,456 --> 00:45:44,336
Taliesin: We're all gonna die.

1285
00:45:44,336 --> 00:45:44,836
Travis: We're all gonna die.

1286
00:45:44,836 --> 00:45:46,112
Matt: He glances over and says -

1287
00:45:46,112 --> 00:45:47,316
Balgus: Dragonborn.

1288
00:45:47,316 --> 00:45:49,116
I haven't fought one of your kind in a long time.

1289
00:45:49,116 --> 00:45:50,936
Tiberius: Oh! Who's the last dragonborn you fought?

1290
00:45:50,936 --> 00:45:53,056
Do you remember his name?

1291
00:45:53,056 --> 00:45:57,771
Balgus: I recall his name was 'broken and bloody.'

1292
00:45:57,771 --> 00:45:58,476
Scanlan: I think that's a friend of yours.

1293
00:45:58,476 --> 00:46:00,523
Tiberius: No I know him! I know the bloody family,

1294
00:46:00,523 --> 00:46:02,662
they're terrible people.

1295
00:46:02,662 --> 00:46:05,364
Anyway, my associates and I were wondering if you might come -

1296
00:46:05,364 --> 00:46:07,602
Orion: Is that what we're doing?

1297
00:46:07,602 --> 00:46:10,147
Trying to get him to come with us?

1298
00:46:10,147 --> 00:46:13,976
Scanlan: We're trying to find out more about Greyspine.

1299
00:46:13,976 --> 00:46:15,536
Tiberius: Yes!

1300
00:46:15,536 --> 00:46:17,076
Scanlan: Where he might be or who his associates might be.

1301
00:46:17,076 --> 00:46:19,276
Keyleth: Gee, I'm so glad you came.

1302
00:46:19,276 --> 00:46:20,916
Tiberius: Would you like to accompany us on this

1303
00:46:20,916 --> 00:46:22,546
journey that we're taking?

1304
00:46:22,546 --> 00:46:23,692
Laura: Oh god.

1305
00:46:23,692 --> 00:46:25,676
Tiberius: We're trying to find the Greyspines and you seem like

1306
00:46:25,676 --> 00:46:27,001
you would want to come in on this.

1307
00:46:27,001 --> 00:46:28,909
Percy: We think there might be something rotten in the mines.

1308
00:46:28,909 --> 00:46:31,433
Matt: Make a persuasion roll. You can assist if you like.

1309
00:46:31,433 --> 00:46:33,496
Taliesin: I'm assisting in this persuasion roll, good god.

1310
00:46:33,496 --> 00:46:34,616
Laura: Oh god.

1311
00:46:34,616 --> 00:46:36,096
Matt: That just means he has advantage.

1312
00:46:36,096 --> 00:46:37,216
Travis: Do we want to go to the mines or do we wanna go the house?

1313
00:46:37,216 --> 00:46:37,869
Laura: No we want to go to the -

1314
00:46:37,869 --> 00:46:38,996
I thought we wanted to go to the house.

1315
00:46:38,996 --> 00:46:40,476
Orion: Oh, I get advantage?

1316
00:46:40,476 --> 00:46:41,696
Taliesin: 21.

1317
00:46:41,696 --> 00:46:42,416
Matt: Yeah, so you get advantage on this roll.

1318
00:46:42,416 --> 00:46:42,987
Sam: So you roll twice.

1319
00:46:42,987 --> 00:46:44,156
Marisha: What was the first thing you rolled?

1320
00:46:44,156 --> 00:46:46,249
Orion: 3. And I'll take the 18.

1321
00:46:46,249 --> 00:46:47,576
Marisha: Definitely take that 18.

1322
00:46:47,576 --> 00:46:48,655
Orion: Oh and plus my -

1323
00:46:48,655 --> 00:46:49,896
Marisha: Persuasion.

1324
00:46:49,896 --> 00:46:51,223
Matt: So, he looks at you keenly, which-

1325
00:46:51,223 --> 00:46:52,416
Orion: Which is a 9.

1326
00:46:52,416 --> 00:46:52,996
Matt: Which is a 9?

1327
00:46:52,996 --> 00:46:53,496
Orion: Yes.

1328
00:46:53,496 --> 00:46:54,876
Laura: Wow, you have a 9 persuasion?!

1329
00:46:54,876 --> 00:46:55,716
Orion: That's why I talk.

1330
00:46:55,716 --> 00:46:56,016
Laura: What?!

1331
00:46:56,016 --> 00:46:57,408
Marisha: He's pretty charismatic.

1332
00:46:57,408 --> 00:46:58,776
Matt: So he goes -

1333
00:46:58,776 --> 00:47:01,233
Balgus: Well no, I don't really want to go anywhere with ya.

1334
00:47:01,233 --> 00:47:04,316
But, if you're looking to go ahead and talk to the Greyspines,

1335
00:47:04,316 --> 00:47:05,778
you don't want to go empty-handed.

1336
00:47:05,778 --> 00:47:06,312
Vex: No.

1337
00:47:06,312 --> 00:47:09,652
Balgus: It's customary to come with a gift of some kind.

1338
00:47:09,652 --> 00:47:10,771
Vex: Oh really?

1339
00:47:10,771 --> 00:47:12,156
Scanlan: What might they like?

1340
00:47:12,156 --> 00:47:15,956
Balgus: Well, let's just say, I have the finest brewery in the city.

1341
00:47:15,956 --> 00:47:17,070
Vex: Oh!

1342
00:47:17,070 --> 00:47:19,688
Balgus: And I have some fine, very rare,

1343
00:47:19,688 --> 00:47:24,016
very exotic drinks that I could, perchance, sell to ya.

1344
00:47:24,016 --> 00:47:26,258
Vax: Pay the dwarf.

1345
00:47:26,258 --> 00:47:29,383
Vex: How much for this exotic ale?

1346
00:47:29,383 --> 00:47:30,928
Balgus: How exotic ya wantin’?

1347
00:47:30,928 --> 00:47:31,936
Tiberius: Ooh!

1348
00:47:31,936 --> 00:47:35,896
Vex: We want to get in the door. We want him to like us.

1349
00:47:35,896 --> 00:47:38,971
Balgus: I can give you the finest of

1350
00:47:38,971 --> 00:47:41,556
thistle branch, darkblood wine.

1351
00:47:41,556 --> 00:47:43,391
Vex: Ooh!

1352
00:47:43,391 --> 00:47:44,908
Balgus: This was crafted by myself,

1353
00:47:44,908 --> 00:47:46,431
from a rare bloodthistle branch

1354
00:47:46,431 --> 00:47:50,628
that I had brought over from the far-off city of Kamorda.

1355
00:47:50,628 --> 00:47:52,996
This, I personally oversaw.

1356
00:47:52,996 --> 00:47:56,059
It took me four years to fill this barrel full.

1357
00:47:56,059 --> 00:47:58,816
And it'll cost you 500 gold pieces.

1358
00:47:58,816 --> 00:48:02,218
But is a king’s red wine!

1359
00:48:02,218 --> 00:48:04,136
Marisha: Can I do a persuasion check or

1360
00:48:04,136 --> 00:48:05,785
a perception check to see if he's lying.

1361
00:48:05,785 --> 00:48:06,836
Matt: This would be insight.

1362
00:48:06,836 --> 00:48:08,084
Go ahead and roll insight.

1363
00:48:08,084 --> 00:48:09,336
Marisha: An insight check?

1364
00:48:09,336 --> 00:48:10,996
Taliesin: I'm gonna go walk over to Grog really quickly.

1365
00:48:10,996 --> 00:48:12,515
Laura: (whispering to Travis) What's in the bag of holding right now?

1366
00:48:12,515 --> 00:48:13,368
Marisha: 27.

1367
00:48:13,368 --> 00:48:15,287
Matt: He seems too drunk to lie.

1368
00:48:15,287 --> 00:48:16,314
Orion: Nice.

1369
00:48:16,314 --> 00:48:17,176
Marisha: Okay.

1370
00:48:17,176 --> 00:48:18,755
Sam: Let's just do it.

1371
00:48:18,755 --> 00:48:19,287
Matt: And an eager businessman.

1372
00:48:19,287 --> 00:48:23,956
Vex: Tell you what, Balgus.

1373
00:48:23,956 --> 00:48:25,636
Percy: Perhaps he would maybe, bet?

1374
00:48:25,636 --> 00:48:26,136
Put forward a wager? In an oval.

1375
00:48:26,136 --> 00:48:26,736
Do you have any thoughts on this, Grog?

1376
00:48:26,736 --> 00:48:27,296
Marisha: But is it worth 500 gold?

1377
00:48:27,296 --> 00:48:29,456
Orion: Mm, probably.

1378
00:48:29,456 --> 00:48:30,614
Vex: We have some very rare items with us

1379
00:48:30,614 --> 00:48:31,216
that I think you might be interested in.

1380
00:48:31,216 --> 00:48:32,954
Balgus: Make it quick! You've got one minute.

1381
00:48:32,954 --> 00:48:34,116
Marisha: What?

1382
00:48:34,116 --> 00:48:35,136
Vex: We've got one minute? Well, we've got-

1383
00:48:35,136 --> 00:48:36,336
Balgus: My time is far worth the 500 gold

1384
00:48:36,336 --> 00:48:37,856
you've already been talking about.

1385
00:48:37,856 --> 00:48:38,540
Marisha: Yes, seems like it.

1386
00:48:38,540 --> 00:48:40,416
Vex: We've got this with us right now.

1387
00:48:40,416 --> 00:48:42,421
Travis: We've got a bunch of dragon pieces.

1388
00:48:42,421 --> 00:48:43,796
Tiberius: Do you like dragon pieces?

1389
00:48:43,796 --> 00:48:45,076
Vex: We've got a dragon -

1390
00:48:45,076 --> 00:48:45,848
Travis: We've got 37 dragon teeth, 1 dragon eye,

1391
00:48:45,848 --> 00:48:47,895
4 cups of dragon blood -

1392
00:48:47,895 --> 00:48:49,792
Vex: We've got this cup of dragon blood!

1393
00:48:49,792 --> 00:48:54,780
Which I know can be added to ale or wine

1394
00:48:54,780 --> 00:48:58,148
and makes it quite sensational.

1395
00:48:58,148 --> 00:48:59,408
Percy: Grog! Battle wager?

1396
00:48:59,408 --> 00:49:02,196
Matt: He takes the sealed cup and sloshes it around in his hand.

1397
00:49:02,196 --> 00:49:05,836
And you can see, the, the actual liquid is coagulated

1398
00:49:05,836 --> 00:49:09,211
to such a point that it's less of a blood

1399
00:49:09,211 --> 00:49:11,056
and more of a gelatin.

1400
00:49:11,056 --> 00:49:12,816
(sloshing sounds)

1401
00:49:12,816 --> 00:49:14,936
Vex: (whispers) That dragon blood is really expensive, actually.

1402
00:49:14,936 --> 00:49:15,576
Grog: It gets better with age.

1403
00:49:15,576 --> 00:49:16,916
Vex: Exactly, a spoon of it!

1404
00:49:16,916 --> 00:49:17,356
Matt: He peeks it open and -

1405
00:49:17,356 --> 00:49:18,996
(sniffs)

1406
00:49:18,996 --> 00:49:19,836
Tiberius: Yes!

1407
00:49:19,836 --> 00:49:21,744
Laura: I think that's really expensive, actually.

1408
00:49:21,744 --> 00:49:22,984
Balgus: I can have this appraised,

1409
00:49:22,984 --> 00:49:24,191
but if you want to do a straight trade

1410
00:49:24,191 --> 00:49:26,154
for the barrel for this, I'll take you up on that.

1411
00:49:26,154 --> 00:49:27,245
Laura: Shit, no.

1412
00:49:27,245 --> 00:49:28,428
Sam: Just go for it.

1413
00:49:28,428 --> 00:49:29,504
Travis: We have four cups.

1414
00:49:29,504 --> 00:49:30,592
Vex: All right, fine! One cup of it.

1415
00:49:30,592 --> 00:49:34,332
Balgus: All right.

1416
00:49:34,332 --> 00:49:35,913
Matt: He takes the thing, he takes the cup,

1417
00:49:35,913 --> 00:49:38,136
puts it in a small satchel on his side.

1418
00:49:38,136 --> 00:49:40,856
Balgus: Adra!

1419
00:49:40,856 --> 00:49:44,539
Adra: Aye, what'dya want, you drunken bastard?

1420
00:49:44,539 --> 00:49:47,721
Balgus: They've bought me thistle blood wine.

1421
00:49:47,721 --> 00:49:49,936
Take it out back. Here's the key.

1422
00:49:49,936 --> 00:49:51,489
Matt: And he tosses her the key. She grabs it and goes -

1423
00:49:51,489 --> 00:49:55,933
Adra: Really? Ooh, just walked in, they're buying fancy.

1424
00:49:55,933 --> 00:49:57,855
(all laugh)

1425
00:49:57,855 --> 00:50:01,249
Matt: She comes back with two of her 'barmaiders'

1426
00:50:01,249 --> 00:50:02,299
who are begrudgingly carrying it with her.

1427
00:50:02,299 --> 00:50:03,836
It's a nice barrel, it actually has like a gold

1428
00:50:03,836 --> 00:50:07,048
trimmed - the actual bands that hold the wood together

1429
00:50:07,048 --> 00:50:09,956
is in itself gold.

1430
00:50:09,956 --> 00:50:11,557
The branding on the side is gold leafed into the wood,

1431
00:50:11,557 --> 00:50:14,835
it's like fine, exquisite, we're talking like top shelf

1432
00:50:14,835 --> 00:50:17,791
BevMo style awesome dwarven wine.

1433
00:50:17,791 --> 00:50:20,656
Marisha: Topshelf at BevMo!

1434
00:50:20,656 --> 00:50:21,938
Matt: You look over and see - he pats it and he goes,

1435
00:50:21,938 --> 00:50:24,476
Balgus: All yours. And if this doesn't get you in the door,

1436
00:50:24,476 --> 00:50:26,790
I'll eat my shoe.

1437
00:50:26,790 --> 00:50:27,536
Vex: Good to know.

1438
00:50:27,536 --> 00:50:29,256
Grog: Have you ever done that?

1439
00:50:29,256 --> 00:50:33,338
Balgus: Maybe, I forget a lot of nights.

1440
00:50:33,338 --> 00:50:36,536
Scanlan: Where might that door be?

1441
00:50:36,536 --> 00:50:38,079
Balgus: Minute’s up, you'll have to ask around,

1442
00:50:38,079 --> 00:50:39,786
but it was great doing business with you.

1443
00:50:39,786 --> 00:50:41,053
Tiberius: You too!

1444
00:50:41,053 --> 00:50:42,416
Vex: Thanks, Balgus.

1445
00:50:42,416 --> 00:50:43,350
Matt: And he walks away from the table.

1446
00:50:43,350 --> 00:50:44,401
Grog: We gotta bag it. I put it in the bag of holding.

1447
00:50:44,401 --> 00:50:45,523
Matt: It does not fit in the bag of holding.

1448
00:50:45,523 --> 00:50:46,436
Laura and Travis: What?!

1449
00:50:46,436 --> 00:50:47,736
Matt: The barrel is too big, you barely -

1450
00:50:47,736 --> 00:50:49,076
Vex: You can carry it, Grog. Strap that to your -

1451
00:50:49,076 --> 00:50:51,279
Matt: You barely got Dork the ox in there. Which, for the record,

1452
00:50:51,279 --> 00:50:53,396
they did fit a small ox in the bag of holding and then realized

1453
00:50:53,396 --> 00:50:55,696
later on that there was no airflow.

1454
00:50:55,696 --> 00:50:56,996
Marisha: We killed the ox.

1455
00:50:56,996 --> 00:50:59,456
Taliesin: I feel like we weren't gonna discuss that,

1456
00:50:59,456 --> 00:51:01,721
I felt that that was in the past and we were never -

1457
00:51:01,721 --> 00:51:02,936
Matt: I felt that was a necessary story.

1458
00:51:02,936 --> 00:51:03,912
Scanlan: Maybe if we drank some of it it would fit.

1459
00:51:03,912 --> 00:51:05,716
Tiberius: It doesn't work like that.

1460
00:51:05,716 --> 00:51:07,752
Laura: I almost pulled out the orc - the troll dick.

1461
00:51:07,752 --> 00:51:08,556
Is that still in there or no?

1462
00:51:08,556 --> 00:51:10,079
Travis: No, we actually got rid of the troll dick.

1463
00:51:10,079 --> 00:51:11,025
Laura: Oh, okay.

1464
00:51:11,025 --> 00:51:13,013
(all laugh)

1465
00:51:13,013 --> 00:51:15,276
Taliesin: (Laughing) Did we trade the troll dick for something?

1466
00:51:15,276 --> 00:51:17,716
Marisha: I thought we like used it as a weapon.

1467
00:51:17,716 --> 00:51:20,400
Travis: I offered it up, but by that time it had turned into a slimy...

1468
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:20,810
Laura: Ewww.

1469
00:51:20,810 --> 00:51:23,914
Travis: It was still impressive, though.

1470
00:51:23,914 --> 00:51:24,923
Marisha: I thought we threw it at somebody.

1471
00:51:24,923 --> 00:51:27,557
Vex: Can I stop Adra then and ask her

1472
00:51:27,557 --> 00:51:29,056
where Greyspine manor is?

1473
00:51:29,056 --> 00:51:31,952
Keep, manor, whatever.

1474
00:51:31,952 --> 00:51:35,110
Adra: Ahh, well I can have him do it.

1475
00:51:35,110 --> 00:51:37,356
Matt: She pokes one of the barmaiders who turns around.

1476
00:51:37,356 --> 00:51:38,731
This one's younger, he looks like he's kind of

1477
00:51:38,731 --> 00:51:40,086
frazzled and maybe new here

1478
00:51:40,086 --> 00:51:42,097
or at least trying to make his way. He goes -

1479
00:51:42,097 --> 00:51:43,476
Barmaider: Okay, I can show you around,

1480
00:51:43,476 --> 00:51:45,596
just follow me outside, come follow me.

1481
00:51:45,596 --> 00:51:48,196
Matt: And he walks up and he's got a little apron on

1482
00:51:48,196 --> 00:51:51,730
and as he leads you guys outside,

1483
00:51:51,730 --> 00:51:53,456
he brings you to the edge of the outer walkway

1484
00:51:53,456 --> 00:51:55,635
of the central ring you're on.

1485
00:51:55,635 --> 00:51:58,496
He points across the way and what you can see

1486
00:51:58,496 --> 00:52:01,016
is a series of marble pillars that outline what looks like

1487
00:52:01,016 --> 00:52:02,516
a residential district that opens and

1488
00:52:02,516 --> 00:52:06,936
consumes the other side of the central ring of Kraghammer.

1489
00:52:06,936 --> 00:52:08,136
He says:

1490
00:52:08,136 --> 00:52:11,065
Barmaider: So if you go past far in that way, you'll look for the house

1491
00:52:11,065 --> 00:52:17,756
of Greyspine, it's the one that has dark black marble with gold

1492
00:52:17,756 --> 00:52:21,104
tinting inside the spiralling vein of the marble, it’s gold.

1493
00:52:21,104 --> 00:52:22,256
Grog: Nice.

1494
00:52:22,256 --> 00:52:24,496
Barmaider: The gate outside is wrought iron, black iron, that's

1495
00:52:24,496 --> 00:52:27,776
topped with a series of pikes and uh-

1496
00:52:27,776 --> 00:52:31,423
Matt: At which Pike awkwardly looks sickeningly,

1497
00:52:31,423 --> 00:52:32,636
not understanding.

1498
00:52:32,636 --> 00:52:35,804
Barmaider: And, the real key point is,

1499
00:52:35,804 --> 00:52:36,856
if you look on the front yard,

1500
00:52:36,856 --> 00:52:40,929
you'll see a dwarven statue of the current ironkeeper himself.

1501
00:52:40,929 --> 00:52:42,845
So that's where you'll want to go.

1502
00:52:42,845 --> 00:52:44,360
Scanlan: Yes, very helpful, young man.

1503
00:52:44,360 --> 00:52:45,676
Vex: Thank you so much.

1504
00:52:45,676 --> 00:52:46,876
Barmaider: Of course. And if you get the chance,

1505
00:52:46,876 --> 00:52:49,676
you could fill out a little form saying how helpful I've been-

1506
00:52:49,676 --> 00:52:50,736
Keyleth: I will.

1507
00:52:50,736 --> 00:52:51,856
Scanlan: Oh, there's suggestion cards here.

1508
00:52:51,856 --> 00:52:52,816
Keyleth: Oh, absolutely.

1509
00:52:52,816 --> 00:52:53,616
Scanlan: I would love to.

1510
00:52:53,616 --> 00:52:54,871
Barmaider: Oh, ah, here.

1511
00:52:54,871 --> 00:52:56,539
Matt: And he pulls out a small parchment and hands it to you.

1512
00:52:56,539 --> 00:52:58,405
It's handwritten with a couple of checkboxes.

1513
00:52:58,405 --> 00:53:00,196
Tiberius: You should give us all a copy so you will have multiple.

1514
00:53:00,196 --> 00:53:00,932
Barmaider: I only have one.

1515
00:53:00,932 --> 00:53:01,516
Tiberius: Oh, okay, that's fine.

1516
00:53:01,516 --> 00:53:03,176
Barmaider: Sorry!

1517
00:53:03,176 --> 00:53:05,546
Scanlan: Confidence needs improvement.

1518
00:53:05,546 --> 00:53:09,816
Vex: Oh, it's okay, we have a wonderful writer. He can make copies.

1519
00:53:09,816 --> 00:53:10,836
Percy: I'll rustle up a few. That’s fine, why not,

1520
00:53:10,836 --> 00:53:12,236
it's what I do apparently.

1521
00:53:12,236 --> 00:53:13,796
Matt: And he runs back into the tavern.

1522
00:53:13,796 --> 00:53:14,876
Vex: All right.

1523
00:53:14,876 --> 00:53:16,210
Scanlan: All right, shall we go to the manor?

1524
00:53:16,210 --> 00:53:17,196
Travis: Yes.

1525
00:53:17,196 --> 00:53:17,945
Vex: Do we want to do the manor right now? What time is it?

1526
00:53:17,945 --> 00:53:19,636
Scanlan: 5 or 6.

1527
00:53:19,636 --> 00:53:21,161
Travis: We gotta sleep.

1528
00:53:21,161 --> 00:53:23,216
Vex: We might not want to bug him when he's,

1529
00:53:23,216 --> 00:53:25,118
you know, having dinner.

1530
00:53:25,118 --> 00:53:27,716
Travis: Cause, let’s be honest, that gate is gonna jack us up.

1531
00:53:27,716 --> 00:53:29,499
It’s gonna be full of trouble.

1532
00:53:29,499 --> 00:53:30,756
Scanlan: All right, yes, let's go sleep.

1533
00:53:30,756 --> 00:53:31,476
Grog: Let’s sleep.

1534
00:53:31,476 --> 00:53:33,996
Vex: Well, it's only 6.

1535
00:53:33,996 --> 00:53:36,916
Scanlan: Well, then we have time to do other things.

1536
00:53:36,916 --> 00:53:38,056
Orion: How long is a short rest?

1537
00:53:38,056 --> 00:53:39,443
Matt: Short rest is around 10 minutes or so.

1538
00:53:39,443 --> 00:53:40,576
Orion: I wanna take short rest.

1539
00:53:40,576 --> 00:53:42,672
Matt: You've technically been shortresting in the tavern.

1540
00:53:42,672 --> 00:53:45,990
It's more of like a post battle - like, take a breather,

1541
00:53:45,990 --> 00:53:47,817
bandage your wounds,

1542
00:53:47,817 --> 00:53:50,817
just settle yourself after a harrowing experience.

1543
00:53:50,817 --> 00:53:52,676
That’s what a short rest is.

1544
00:53:52,676 --> 00:53:54,272
Orion: What was the arcane magic, the manor?

1545
00:53:54,272 --> 00:53:56,936
Matt: Oh, what you're looking for is the house Thunderbrand.

1546
00:53:56,936 --> 00:53:59,118
Orion: I want to head in that direction.

1547
00:53:59,118 --> 00:54:00,316
Matt: Okay, so you're dividing from the party?

1548
00:54:00,316 --> 00:54:01,376
Orion: Mm hmm.

1549
00:54:01,376 --> 00:54:03,156
Tiberius: Oh, I'm going to house Thunderbrand,

1550
00:54:03,156 --> 00:54:04,486
if anybody wants to come with me.

1551
00:54:04,486 --> 00:54:05,153
Laura: What are you doing?

1552
00:54:05,153 --> 00:54:06,716
I can't understand you with that popcorn in your mouth.

1553
00:54:06,716 --> 00:54:09,042
Tiberius: Sorry! I'm going to house Thunderbrand

1554
00:54:09,042 --> 00:54:11,136
before turning in this evening.

1555
00:54:11,136 --> 00:54:14,596
I've had a nice little short rest and I would

1556
00:54:14,596 --> 00:54:16,216
like to ask them a few questions.

1557
00:54:16,216 --> 00:54:17,316
Vex: All right.

1558
00:54:17,316 --> 00:54:18,536
Travis: Yeah, go ahead, okay.

1559
00:54:18,536 --> 00:54:20,527
Scanlan: Is there any recon that's going to happen tonight?

1560
00:54:20,527 --> 00:54:22,656
Vex: I think that you and I are going to go to Greyspine?

1561
00:54:22,656 --> 00:54:24,004
Vax: We'll check out the house.

1562
00:54:24,004 --> 00:54:24,996
Scanlan: Do you need any help?

1563
00:54:24,996 --> 00:54:26,336
Vax: Sure, you can come with us.

1564
00:54:26,336 --> 00:54:27,896
Scanlan: No, I don't want you to say yes.

1565
00:54:27,896 --> 00:54:29,916
(all laugh)

1566
00:54:29,916 --> 00:54:32,398
Vex: Then no, we'll stealth our way.

1567
00:54:32,398 --> 00:54:35,341
Vax: But just a moment. Pike, you seem very distant.

1568
00:54:35,341 --> 00:54:36,936
(all laugh)

1569
00:54:36,936 --> 00:54:39,722
Vax: It's very strange, are you all right?

1570
00:54:39,722 --> 00:54:41,651
Vex: Pike’s not listening, she’s looking at the chatroom.

1571
00:54:41,651 --> 00:54:43,189
Vax: Pike, you seem distracted.

1572
00:54:43,189 --> 00:54:44,647
Scanlan: She’s feeling ill. Pike, does she need to lie down?

1573
00:54:44,647 --> 00:54:47,496
Matt: Pike is feeling, and for those of you who are curious

1574
00:54:47,496 --> 00:54:48,504
in the chat room, once again, elements of this are house ruled,

1575
00:54:48,504 --> 00:54:51,296
so don't complain.

1576
00:54:51,296 --> 00:54:54,156
Laura: Oh, players.

1577
00:54:54,156 --> 00:54:55,216
Matt: We keep short rest to 10 minutes

1578
00:54:55,216 --> 00:54:58,642
because it makes it move faster.

1579
00:54:58,642 --> 00:55:01,456
All right so - Pike, Pike is going along,

1580
00:55:01,456 --> 00:55:02,996
she seems to be a little distracted,

1581
00:55:02,996 --> 00:55:05,908
She can't quite understand, she says:

1582
00:55:05,908 --> 00:55:07,588
Pike: I.. I don't know, I just...

1583
00:55:07,588 --> 00:55:09,656
I feel like I've been here before.

1584
00:55:09,656 --> 00:55:11,103
It's hard to explain.

1585
00:55:11,103 --> 00:55:13,202
Travis: What?

1586
00:55:13,202 --> 00:55:16,717
Pike: Anyway, I'm probably going to go ahead and rest for the evening.

1587
00:55:16,717 --> 00:55:18,539
Matt: And she heads back to the tavern.

1588
00:55:18,539 --> 00:55:19,571
Travis: The fuck does that mean?

1589
00:55:19,571 --> 00:55:21,336
Sam: We'll find out next week.

1590
00:55:21,336 --> 00:55:22,416
Travis: But first...

1591
00:55:22,416 --> 00:55:24,756
Travis: Whores in the bedroom!

1592
00:55:24,756 --> 00:55:25,296
Sam: (laughs)

1593
00:55:25,296 --> 00:55:27,523
Laura: Lovely. Lovely.

1594
00:55:27,523 --> 00:55:28,456
Scanlan: Grog and I go in search of a,

1595
00:55:28,456 --> 00:55:31,073
shall we say politely,

1596
00:55:31,073 --> 00:55:33,116
whorehouse.

1597
00:55:33,116 --> 00:55:34,975
(all laugh)

1598
00:55:34,975 --> 00:55:36,694
Matt: The polite term.

1599
00:55:36,694 --> 00:55:39,776
Liam: Well, the cleric's away, the bard shall play.

1600
00:55:39,776 --> 00:55:41,776
Grog: We need a massage.

1601
00:55:41,776 --> 00:55:43,448
On my crotch.

1602
00:55:43,448 --> 00:55:44,754
Laura: You and I stealth.

1603
00:55:44,754 --> 00:55:45,356
Liam: Yeah.

1604
00:55:45,356 --> 00:55:47,067
Matt: You guys make your way to the Greyspine Manor,

1605
00:55:47,067 --> 00:55:48,976
you guys head for that, you head to Thunderbrand.

1606
00:55:48,976 --> 00:55:50,216
Sam: Is Grog going to find someone his size?

1607
00:55:50,216 --> 00:55:52,416
Matt: (laughs) I'll get to that.

1608
00:55:52,416 --> 00:55:53,705
Keyleth: Percy and I spend some time

1609
00:55:53,705 --> 00:55:56,496
making some really nice comment cards.

1610
00:55:56,496 --> 00:55:57,316
Percy: Comment cards.

1611
00:55:57,316 --> 00:56:00,276
Matt: All right, awesome. Wonderful.

1612
00:56:00,276 --> 00:56:01,652
Percy: We're going to make some beautiful comment cards.

1613
00:56:01,652 --> 00:56:02,915
Marisha: For - what's his name?

1614
00:56:02,915 --> 00:56:04,656
Matt: His name is Balan.

1615
00:56:04,656 --> 00:56:05,589
Everyone: Balan.

1616
00:56:05,589 --> 00:56:06,276
Laura: He's adorable. I love Balan.

1617
00:56:06,276 --> 00:56:07,583
Marisha: We're going to make some

1618
00:56:07,583 --> 00:56:09,236
wonderful comment cards for Balan.

1619
00:56:09,236 --> 00:56:10,270
Vax: Oh, Percy is wonderful with calligraphy,

1620
00:56:10,270 --> 00:56:10,914
you've shown me.

1621
00:56:10,914 --> 00:56:12,136
Percy: Yes, thank you.

1622
00:56:12,136 --> 00:56:13,326
Matt: Okay, so you'll get to that.

1623
00:56:13,326 --> 00:56:15,588
You guys do manage to find what's called The Stone's Pillow.

1624
00:56:15,588 --> 00:56:16,373
Travis: The Stone's Pillow?

1625
00:56:16,373 --> 00:56:17,636
Matt: The Stone's Pillow.

1626
00:56:17,636 --> 00:56:19,069
Travis: I love it.

1627
00:56:19,069 --> 00:56:19,796
Laura: Ridiculous.

1628
00:56:19,796 --> 00:56:22,499
Matt: It's an establishment of comfort and ease,

1629
00:56:22,499 --> 00:56:24,064
and will run you both for the evening,

1630
00:56:24,064 --> 00:56:27,537
as you are not Kraghammer locals,

1631
00:56:27,537 --> 00:56:29,596
30 gold for the night each.

1632
00:56:29,596 --> 00:56:29,996
Laura: (shocked gasp)

1633
00:56:29,996 --> 00:56:31,296
Grog: A bargain.

1634
00:56:31,296 --> 00:56:32,637
Scanlan: We'll take it.

1635
00:56:32,637 --> 00:56:33,516
Laura: 30 gold?!

1636
00:56:33,516 --> 00:56:35,496
Marisha: Why is everything so much more expensive here?

1637
00:56:35,496 --> 00:56:36,755
Orion: Because it's dwarf-town, man.

1638
00:56:36,755 --> 00:56:38,351
Sam: But what sort of, ah, ladies, will we find there?

1639
00:56:38,351 --> 00:56:39,716
Matt: (laughs)

1640
00:56:39,716 --> 00:56:41,016
Laura: Bearded ladies.

1641
00:56:41,016 --> 00:56:42,456
Sam: What species?

1642
00:56:42,456 --> 00:56:43,814
Liam: (laughs)

1643
00:56:43,814 --> 00:56:47,467
Matt: The madam of the house introduces you to a spectrum of ladies,

1644
00:56:47,467 --> 00:56:49,733
mostly dwarven, and very attractive, you know.

1645
00:56:49,733 --> 00:56:54,516
This is a nice establishment.

1646
00:56:54,516 --> 00:56:55,576
Liam: Do you deal in tiefling?

1647
00:56:55,576 --> 00:56:56,717
Sam: They're not gnomes.

1648
00:56:56,717 --> 00:56:57,956
Matt: There is one gnome. One female gnome.

1649
00:56:57,956 --> 00:56:59,272
There are a number of male dwarves as well,

1650
00:56:59,272 --> 00:57:01,076
that are standing at the ready.

1651
00:57:01,076 --> 00:57:03,076
Matt: There is one elf, looks a little shy.

1652
00:57:03,076 --> 00:57:09,375
And kind of embarrassed that a goliath walked in.

1653
00:57:09,375 --> 00:57:10,636
Sam: And that's our choice.

1654
00:57:10,636 --> 00:57:11,536
Matt: Those are your choices.

1655
00:57:11,536 --> 00:57:12,656
Travis: I'll take the tallest one.

1656
00:57:12,656 --> 00:57:14,076
Sam: I'll take a dwarf.

1657
00:57:14,076 --> 00:57:15,826
Matt: (laughs) Okay.

1658
00:57:15,826 --> 00:57:19,276
Matt: So you choose your lady, you take the tallest one

1659
00:57:19,276 --> 00:57:21,454
which would probably be the elf.

1660
00:57:21,454 --> 00:57:25,763
As you walk in, the shy elf turns around entirely.

1661
00:57:25,763 --> 00:57:28,721
She is aggressive and throws you around.

1662
00:57:28,721 --> 00:57:30,484
You got your money's worth.

1663
00:57:30,484 --> 00:57:32,688
Matt: You get manhandled in a way that you haven't -

1664
00:57:32,688 --> 00:57:35,043
You're gonna be sore in the morning.

1665
00:57:35,043 --> 00:57:38,714
Travis (as Scanlan): Thank you!

1666
00:57:38,714 --> 00:57:40,116
Matt: Welcome to Kraghammer, gentlemen.

1667
00:57:40,116 --> 00:57:41,767
(all laugh)

1668
00:57:41,767 --> 00:57:42,996
Travis: I like it already.

1669
00:57:42,996 --> 00:57:44,376
Matt: All right, you guys.

1670
00:57:44,376 --> 00:57:45,816
Laura: Yes.

1671
00:57:45,816 --> 00:57:47,829
Matt: Both - are, are you just walking up to the manor, are you doing-

1672
00:57:47,829 --> 00:57:49,166
Liam: No, no no.

1673
00:57:49,166 --> 00:57:50,596
Laura: We're gonna try to check out what it looks like.

1674
00:57:50,596 --> 00:57:51,496
Matt: Okay.

1675
00:57:51,496 --> 00:57:53,116
Laura: See what the guards are like.

1676
00:57:53,116 --> 00:57:54,956
Liam: Yeah, we'll pretend to take a stroll...

1677
00:57:54,956 --> 00:57:56,200
Laura: Yes.

1678
00:57:56,200 --> 00:57:57,156
Liam: Pose as a married couple.

1679
00:57:57,156 --> 00:57:58,009
Laura: Ew, no.

1680
00:57:58,009 --> 00:57:59,996
Liam: Just for the purposes of sneaking around the house.

1681
00:57:59,996 --> 00:58:01,316
Matt: I don't know if that's illegal in Kraghammer.

1682
00:58:01,316 --> 00:58:02,396
Laura: (retching sound)

1683
00:58:02,396 --> 00:58:03,576
Liam: I want to see what the area's like.

1684
00:58:03,576 --> 00:58:05,719
Vex: How about we pose as brother and sister, creepy?

1685
00:58:05,719 --> 00:58:09,617
(all laugh)

1686
00:58:09,617 --> 00:58:13,227
Vax: You come on to every human, orc,

1687
00:58:13,227 --> 00:58:15,916
and half-elf in the entire kingdom,

1688
00:58:15,916 --> 00:58:19,140
but pretending to be my wife for 30 minutes is too much.

1689
00:58:19,140 --> 00:58:21,918
Vex: Yes. It's disgusting, so no.

1690
00:58:21,918 --> 00:58:23,023
Vax: You're probably right.

1691
00:58:23,023 --> 00:58:24,338
Matt: She's got standards.

1692
00:58:24,338 --> 00:58:25,636
Liam: Okay. So we'll take a stroll.

1693
00:58:25,636 --> 00:58:26,296
Matt: Okay.

1694
00:58:26,296 --> 00:58:28,096
Liam: Shop, see what the area's like.

1695
00:58:28,096 --> 00:58:29,596
Matt: As you enter the residential district,

1696
00:58:29,596 --> 00:58:30,056
it is dark and you see the

1697
00:58:30,056 --> 00:58:32,316
redstone that permeates the area for a low gentle glow

1698
00:58:32,316 --> 00:58:34,496
of the entire city is now clustered into

1699
00:58:34,496 --> 00:58:37,936
these street lamps that are throughout the entire location.

1700
00:58:37,936 --> 00:58:41,255
As you begin to press into the residential district proper,

1701
00:58:41,255 --> 00:58:41,995
there's some nice homes that are carved

1702
00:58:41,995 --> 00:58:44,638
into the side of the rock, there's some stand-alone homes that

1703
00:58:44,638 --> 00:58:46,196
are built out of fine stone;

1704
00:58:46,196 --> 00:58:47,674
you eventually make your way towards the nicer part of it,

1705
00:58:47,674 --> 00:58:48,981
where you start seeing some of the more marble buildings,

1706
00:58:48,981 --> 00:58:52,821
some of the more exotic stonework being used in the construction

1707
00:58:52,821 --> 00:58:54,134
of the homes.

1708
00:58:54,134 --> 00:58:59,876
You also notice three of the guards that are part of the

1709
00:58:59,876 --> 00:59:01,658
city establishment there are following you

1710
00:59:01,658 --> 00:59:03,196
from behind, curiously.

1711
00:59:03,196 --> 00:59:04,797
The Carvers.

1712
00:59:04,797 --> 00:59:08,176
Vex: Oh shit, the Carvers. Shit.

1713
00:59:08,176 --> 00:59:11,375
Matt: No weapons drawn, but definitely hands at the ready.

1714
00:59:11,375 --> 00:59:13,106
Vex &amp; Vax: Okay.

1715
00:59:13,106 --> 00:59:14,712
Vax: Well, we could just keep walking.

1716
00:59:14,712 --> 00:59:16,481
Vex: We could, but that could be bad.

1717
00:59:16,481 --> 00:59:19,099
Vax: Yes. No, we just want to look at the house.

1718
00:59:19,099 --> 00:59:20,880
Sam: Louder!

1719
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:22,156
Vax: I mean we're not going to go sneaking in in the day.

1720
00:59:22,156 --> 00:59:23,127
Vex: Let's be very obvious about it...

1721
00:59:23,127 --> 00:59:24,186
Sam: Louder!

1722
00:59:24,186 --> 00:59:25,316
Matt: Louder into the mic.

1723
00:59:25,316 --> 00:59:27,294
Vex: Let's say which ones are very obvious about being pretty,

1724
00:59:27,294 --> 00:59:29,376
so we look like we're just sightseeing.

1725
00:59:29,376 --> 00:59:30,437
Vax: Yes.

1726
00:59:30,437 --> 00:59:32,965
Matt: (chuckles darkly) All right, so as you continue to walk,

1727
00:59:32,965 --> 00:59:34,877
eventually some of the dwarves approach, and one goes -

1728
00:59:34,877 --> 00:59:36,696
Laura: I point and say:

1729
00:59:36,696 --> 00:59:38,516
Vex: Oh! Look at that one, with the carving, it's amazing!

1730
00:59:38,516 --> 00:59:40,116
Vax: The architecture is divine.

1731
00:59:40,116 --> 00:59:41,718
Vex: Divine!

1732
00:59:41,718 --> 00:59:45,015
Sam: (snorts) They're posing as the Howells?

1733
00:59:45,015 --> 00:59:47,427
(all laugh)

1734
00:59:47,427 --> 00:59:51,256
Liam (heavy accent): Lovey, would you look at this dwarven home?

1735
00:59:51,256 --> 00:59:52,905
Matt (same accent as Liam): It's incredible.

1736
00:59:52,905 --> 00:59:53,704
(all laugh)

1737
00:59:53,704 --> 00:59:56,106
Matt (same accent as Liam): The marble texture on this is gorgeous.

1738
00:59:56,106 --> 00:59:57,968
Matt: So you get about 20 more feet before you get:

1739
00:59:57,968 --> 01:00:03,082
Guard: Hail! Hail!

Vex: Oh my! Yes? (giggles)

1740
01:00:03,082 --> 01:00:04,944
Guard: You foreigners are wandering too far

1741
01:00:04,944 --> 01:00:06,176
in districts you don't belong to.

1742
01:00:06,176 --> 01:00:08,336
What's your business?

1743
01:00:08,336 --> 01:00:12,022
Vex: Oh I'm so sorry, I was just so amazed by the architecture here,

1744
01:00:12,022 --> 01:00:14,557
I wanted to see the beautiful sculpture.

1745
01:00:14,557 --> 01:00:17,659
Vax: We definitely are visitors here, sir,

1746
01:00:17,659 --> 01:00:20,069
no one has explained the rules to your city.

1747
01:00:20,069 --> 01:00:24,176
We were just taking in the fantastic architecture,

1748
01:00:24,176 --> 01:00:25,776
and history of Kraghammer.

1749
01:00:25,776 --> 01:00:29,275
Vex: We were told there was a beautiful sculpture down the street,

1750
01:00:29,275 --> 01:00:30,996
of the ruler of Kraghammer?

1751
01:00:30,996 --> 01:00:32,639
Matt: Make a persuasion roll.

1752
01:00:32,639 --> 01:00:33,136
Sam: Oh Jesus.

1753
01:00:33,136 --> 01:00:33,918
Travis: Oh god.

1754
01:00:33,918 --> 01:00:35,596
Matt: Either of you, whichever you prefer.

1755
01:00:35,596 --> 01:00:36,896
Sam: If only I were there.

1756
01:00:36,896 --> 01:00:38,742
Laura: Twenty... one.

1757
01:00:38,742 --> 01:00:40,475
Matt: All right, all right.

1758
01:00:40,475 --> 01:00:43,924
Travis: Wow! Pretty decent, good for you.

1759
01:00:43,924 --> 01:00:45,349
Matt: The guards come up to each other,

1760
01:00:45,349 --> 01:00:46,956
the one that was talking to you,

1761
01:00:46,956 --> 01:00:48,756
you can see now, as he comes a little closer into the light,

1762
01:00:48,756 --> 01:00:52,218
a frazzled black beard that's pulled into a very, very tight braid

1763
01:00:52,218 --> 01:00:53,556
that goes down to his belly button,

1764
01:00:53,556 --> 01:00:55,292
all wearing the same basic chest plate,

1765
01:00:55,292 --> 01:00:56,882
long black kind-of velvet cloak behind,

1766
01:00:56,882 --> 01:00:59,436
each carrying some sort of heavy war-hammer

1767
01:00:59,436 --> 01:01:01,377
around the side of their belt, steps up and says:

1768
01:01:01,377 --> 01:01:04,816
Guard: Well, just to tell you the rules here,

1769
01:01:04,816 --> 01:01:06,736
if you’re gonna go ahead and wander at night

1770
01:01:06,736 --> 01:01:09,223
in a very expensive district, you don't wanna do it

1771
01:01:09,223 --> 01:01:11,781
by yourself, because you either have chances of being mugged,

1772
01:01:11,781 --> 01:01:14,956
or arrested, we might have arrested you.

1773
01:01:14,956 --> 01:01:17,656
Vex: Oh no! I'm so sorry!

1774
01:01:17,656 --> 01:01:22,436
Well, do we need protection?

1775
01:01:22,436 --> 01:01:24,656
Matt: And one of them looks over and sees the bear

1776
01:01:24,656 --> 01:01:26,276
that is off in the shadows nearby.

1777
01:01:26,276 --> 01:01:27,716
Sam: Oh god.

1778
01:01:27,716 --> 01:01:30,296
Laura: (laughing) I thought Trinket stayed behind.

1779
01:01:30,296 --> 01:01:32,636
Cool, cool!

1780
01:01:32,636 --> 01:01:35,097
Sam: What is that bear doing here?

1781
01:01:35,097 --> 01:01:36,668
Matt: As Trinket's like quietly trying to keep up

1782
01:01:36,668 --> 01:01:37,396
with his wonderful master.

1783
01:01:37,396 --> 01:01:38,889
Vax: Come along Trinket, there there's nothing to be scared of.

1784
01:01:38,889 --> 01:01:39,596
Vex: Oh yes, yes.

1785
01:01:39,596 --> 01:01:41,096
Guard: That's a bear!

1786
01:01:41,096 --> 01:01:42,416
What's a bear doing in Kraghammer?!

1787
01:01:42,416 --> 01:01:43,416
Vex: Oh no he's...

1788
01:01:43,416 --> 01:01:44,024
Matt: They all grab out their warhammers.

1789
01:01:44,024 --> 01:01:46,236
Vex: Oh no, please, he's quite harmless.

1790
01:01:46,236 --> 01:01:49,890
In fact, he's he's very scared of most people.

1791
01:01:49,890 --> 01:01:52,036
Vax: He's completely trained, he does tricks.

1792
01:01:52,036 --> 01:01:53,276
Doesn't he do tricks?

1793
01:01:53,276 --> 01:01:56,235
Vex: He does. Trinket show them your wonderful shake trick.

1794
01:01:56,235 --> 01:01:58,668
Matt: At which point Trinket -

1795
01:01:58,668 --> 01:02:02,396
Trinket: (subdued growling)

1796
01:02:02,396 --> 01:02:05,536
Matt: Just shakes her whole body, looks at you confused.

1797
01:02:05,536 --> 01:02:08,181
Vex: That's good.

1798
01:02:08,181 --> 01:02:09,374
Matt: Then raises a paw up, and -

1799
01:02:09,374 --> 01:02:11,256
Trinket: (growling)

1800
01:02:11,256 --> 01:02:13,416
Vex: If you put your paw out, if you put your hand out,

1801
01:02:13,416 --> 01:02:14,696
he'll shake your hand.

1802
01:02:14,696 --> 01:02:17,301
Yeah, see!

1803
01:02:17,301 --> 01:02:19,756
Sam: I would not do that.

1804
01:02:19,756 --> 01:02:21,845
Matt: The dwarves take a step back as the claw goes through the -

1805
01:02:21,845 --> 01:02:23,656
Guard: That's all right. I would say if that's your animal -

1806
01:02:23,656 --> 01:02:24,510
Vex: Yes?

1807
01:02:24,510 --> 01:02:25,956
Guard: Don't bring it here.

1808
01:02:25,956 --> 01:02:30,036
Vex: Oh, good to know good to know.

1809
01:02:30,036 --> 01:02:32,976
Trinket, head back to that, tavern would you,

1810
01:02:32,976 --> 01:02:34,864
people are getting nervous.

1811
01:02:34,864 --> 01:02:36,311
Trinket: (growling)

1812
01:02:36,311 --> 01:02:37,316
Vex: I love you.

1813
01:02:37,316 --> 01:02:39,556
Matt: Trinket begins to walk back you can see a couple of other dwarves

1814
01:02:39,556 --> 01:02:41,116
that are wandering carrying some packages to the side

1815
01:02:41,116 --> 01:02:43,295
make a very wide berth around this armored bear

1816
01:02:43,295 --> 01:02:47,212
that's slowly moping its way through the streets of Kraghammer.

1817
01:02:47,212 --> 01:02:48,876
What could possibly go wrong?

1818
01:02:48,876 --> 01:02:50,315
Vex: He's so cute.

1819
01:02:50,315 --> 01:02:51,596
Vax: Don't worry, he's a sweetheart, he's fine.

1820
01:02:51,596 --> 01:02:52,096
Vex: He's adorable.

1821
01:02:52,096 --> 01:02:53,516
Trinket: (growls)

1822
01:02:53,516 --> 01:02:54,203
Matt: You hear in the distance.

1823
01:02:54,203 --> 01:02:55,274
Vex: Oh.

1824
01:02:55,274 --> 01:02:56,671
Matt: The one goes like -

1825
01:02:56,671 --> 01:02:58,596
Guard: (whispers): Look, I'll show you to the statue and

1826
01:02:58,596 --> 01:03:00,416
that's it, then you gotta go.

1827
01:03:00,416 --> 01:03:01,336
Vex: (whispers): All right.

1828
01:03:01,336 --> 01:03:01,836
Guard: (whispers): All right

1829
01:03:01,836 --> 01:03:02,884
Vex: (whispers): Thank you.

1830
01:03:02,884 --> 01:03:05,056
Guard: (whispers): I don't see many half-elves here and honestly

1831
01:03:05,056 --> 01:03:06,176
I'm excited to meet you so,

1832
01:03:06,176 --> 01:03:08,062
I just, let’s do this quickly and...

1833
01:03:08,062 --> 01:03:09,356
Vex: (whispers): Yes, okay.

1834
01:03:09,356 --> 01:03:10,776
Guard: (whispers): Come with me.

1835
01:03:10,776 --> 01:03:12,361
Matt: And he leads you further into the cityscape down the road.

1836
01:03:12,361 --> 01:03:14,797
You end up going through a few buildings,

1837
01:03:14,797 --> 01:03:16,576
you find one large wrought iron fence with

1838
01:03:16,576 --> 01:03:18,416
a series of carved spikes towards the top, and you see

1839
01:03:18,416 --> 01:03:21,056
the beautiful dark marble building with the gold trim.

1840
01:03:21,056 --> 01:03:23,496
Vex: Oh, this one's amazing.

1841
01:03:23,496 --> 01:03:27,676
Guard: This is what you were talking about, Greyspine manor.

1842
01:03:27,676 --> 01:03:29,976
Lot of rich sons of bitches.

1843
01:03:29,976 --> 01:03:32,532
(all laugh)

1844
01:03:32,532 --> 01:03:34,479
Vex: Wow, so you said the Greyspines own this one?

1845
01:03:34,479 --> 01:03:35,596
Guard: Aye.

1846
01:03:35,596 --> 01:03:39,557
Vax: It's stunning, we only heard about the building itself,

1847
01:03:39,557 --> 01:03:41,833
what can you tell us about the people who live here?

1848
01:03:41,833 --> 01:03:44,756
Guard: Bunch of rich sons of bitches.

1849
01:03:44,756 --> 01:03:46,314
Vex: Well, we can tell that can't we?

1850
01:03:46,314 --> 01:03:47,656
Guard: Actually, actually Ironkeeper's all right,

1851
01:03:47,656 --> 01:03:49,216
he's been doing a great job.

1852
01:03:49,216 --> 01:03:50,781
The rest of the family can suck off.

1853
01:03:50,781 --> 01:03:51,296
Vex: Oh, really?

1854
01:03:51,296 --> 01:03:53,136
Vax: Not liked by the rest of the city then?

1855
01:03:53,136 --> 01:03:54,856
Guard: Oh, they have friends everywhere,

1856
01:03:54,856 --> 01:03:56,456
but I personally don't like them.

1857
01:03:56,456 --> 01:03:58,106
They run business pretty dark, they work most

1858
01:03:58,106 --> 01:04:01,396
of their employees to the ground. To the bone.

1859
01:04:01,396 --> 01:04:02,241
Vex: Oh no.

1860
01:04:02,241 --> 01:04:03,336
Vax: Yeah that sounds terrible.

1861
01:04:03,336 --> 01:04:04,796
Guard: I don't think that's how you run a business.

1862
01:04:04,796 --> 01:04:06,862
Well, that's how you run a business for profit but not for -

1863
01:04:06,862 --> 01:04:07,923
Vex: Wow. It sounds like they would run

1864
01:04:07,923 --> 01:04:09,276
the mithral mine which we've heard is just,

1865
01:04:09,276 --> 01:04:10,756
so hard on its employees.

1866
01:04:10,756 --> 01:04:11,423
Guard: Aye, that's the one.

1867
01:04:11,423 --> 01:04:12,449
Vex: Oh, really?

1868
01:04:12,449 --> 01:04:14,162
Guard: Yeah.

1869
01:04:14,162 --> 01:04:15,088
Guard: I don't know, I don't go that far south,

1870
01:04:15,088 --> 01:04:16,756
doesn't interest me.

1871
01:04:16,756 --> 01:04:18,338
Vax: Nor us.

1872
01:04:18,338 --> 01:04:19,898
Guard: Smells like, brimstone.

1873
01:04:19,898 --> 01:04:20,316
Vex: I don't blame you.

1874
01:04:20,316 --> 01:04:24,206
Vax: We prefer the company of good hard working people, like yourself.

1875
01:04:24,206 --> 01:04:26,936
We're very impressed with the work the carvers do in this city,

1876
01:04:26,936 --> 01:04:29,236
from what little we've seen so far, so hats off to you.

1877
01:04:29,236 --> 01:04:31,161
Guard: I appreciate that.

1878
01:04:31,161 --> 01:04:32,356
Vex: Yes.

1879
01:04:32,356 --> 01:04:35,062
Guard: You know it's not easy like, you're kind of born into it.

1880
01:04:35,062 --> 01:04:35,596
And we spend most of our time training,

1881
01:04:35,596 --> 01:04:39,655
which can get very boring.

1882
01:04:39,655 --> 01:04:40,564
Matt: You see that two of the dwarves that are now

1883
01:04:40,564 --> 01:04:41,720
about two steps behind go:

1884
01:04:41,720 --> 01:04:43,016
Guard 2: (clears throat) All right Tomsan!

1885
01:04:43,016 --> 01:04:45,256
We gotta get back to our post!

1886
01:04:45,256 --> 01:04:47,716
Guard: Oh, sorry. Look we've dillied about too much,

1887
01:04:47,716 --> 01:04:49,816
just follow us back,

1888
01:04:49,816 --> 01:04:51,036
go about your business, don't wander here at night,

1889
01:04:51,036 --> 01:04:53,796
and uh, good luck.

1890
01:04:53,796 --> 01:04:55,576
Vex: Thank you so much.

1891
01:04:55,576 --> 01:04:56,678
Vax: Thank you.

1892
01:04:56,678 --> 01:04:59,716
Liam: We follow for a couple of blocks, behind them for a bit.

1893
01:04:59,716 --> 01:05:01,511
Laura: Make sure that they're paying attention to us.

1894
01:05:01,511 --> 01:05:02,656
Matt: Mmm hmm.

1895
01:05:02,656 --> 01:05:03,576
Liam: Yes.

1896
01:05:03,576 --> 01:05:05,153
Matt: All right. They bring you back towards the

1897
01:05:05,153 --> 01:05:06,804
entrance of the central district.

1898
01:05:06,804 --> 01:05:07,836
Laura: And then we stealth and -

1899
01:05:07,836 --> 01:05:09,827
Liam: - split off, yes, we can split off.

1900
01:05:09,827 --> 01:05:11,908
Matt: All right, roll stealth, both of you guys.

1901
01:05:11,908 --> 01:05:12,961
Liam: All right!

1902
01:05:12,961 --> 01:05:15,209
Sam: Am I currently being beaten by a whore dwarf or anything?

1903
01:05:15,209 --> 01:05:18,296
(all laugh)

1904
01:05:18,296 --> 01:05:19,836
Matt: Make a constitution check!

1905
01:05:19,836 --> 01:05:20,964
Sam: Constitution check?

1906
01:05:20,964 --> 01:05:22,493
Travis: Hang strong, buddy!

1907
01:05:22,493 --> 01:05:23,456
Orion: That's a mouthful. 'Whore dwarf.'

1908
01:05:23,456 --> 01:05:24,342
Marisha: 'Whore dwarf.'

1909
01:05:24,342 --> 01:05:26,896
Orion: #whoredwarf.

1910
01:05:26,896 --> 01:05:28,776
Sam: Eighteen!

1911
01:05:28,776 --> 01:05:29,796
Matt: Plus your constitution modifier.

1912
01:05:29,796 --> 01:05:32,079
Actually, athletics! Go athletics!

1913
01:05:32,079 --> 01:05:32,376
Sam: ... plus two! Twenty.

1914
01:05:32,376 --> 01:05:33,956
Matt: All right, that's fine.

1915
01:05:33,956 --> 01:05:36,585
You have impressed your female dwarf.

1916
01:05:36,585 --> 01:05:37,643
By the middle of hour two -

1917
01:05:37,643 --> 01:05:39,961
Liam: Are you making a sex check?

1918
01:05:39,961 --> 01:05:40,436
Sam: Yes! I’m sex checking.

1919
01:05:40,436 --> 01:05:41,776
Taliesin: Whore dwarf!

1920
01:05:41,776 --> 01:05:44,037
Matt: That happened. That's the first time.

1921
01:05:44,037 --> 01:05:48,076
Sam: (grunting)

1922
01:05:48,076 --> 01:05:50,148
Laura: This is so uncomfortable.

1923
01:05:50,148 --> 01:05:52,706
Matt: That happened.

1924
01:05:52,706 --> 01:05:54,603
All right, so what'd you guys roll for stealth?

1925
01:05:54,603 --> 01:05:55,796
Liam: Twenty.

1926
01:05:55,796 --> 01:05:57,276
Laura: He rolled a twenty, I rolled a fifteen.

1927
01:05:57,276 --> 01:05:58,826
Travis: That's okay!

1928
01:05:58,826 --> 01:06:07,496
Matt: As you guys begin to wander off, Vax, you vanish.

1929
01:06:07,496 --> 01:06:09,194
Vex, you take a couple steps -

1930
01:06:09,194 --> 01:06:13,414
Guard: ‘Ey ey ey! I told you, it's dangerous down there, in the dark!

1931
01:06:13,414 --> 01:06:14,736
Don't do that!

1932
01:06:14,736 --> 01:06:15,752
Vex: Of course!

1933
01:06:15,752 --> 01:06:18,016
Guard: Where's yer friend?

1934
01:06:18,016 --> 01:06:19,676
Vex: Oh, he already went back to the tavern we're staying at.

1935
01:06:19,676 --> 01:06:21,459
I was wondering if maybe you could show me around

1936
01:06:21,459 --> 01:06:22,936
the rest of the town?

1937
01:06:22,936 --> 01:06:24,569
Matt: He looks to the other guards and

1938
01:06:24,569 --> 01:06:27,576
they’re obviously fed up with his flirting,

1939
01:06:27,576 --> 01:06:29,276
and they're not too keen on you guys.

1940
01:06:29,276 --> 01:06:32,906
Guard: Well, you guys hold up post,

1941
01:06:32,906 --> 01:06:34,116
I’ll give her a quick walk around.

1942
01:06:34,116 --> 01:06:35,436
Vax: Thank you, sir.

1943
01:06:35,436 --> 01:06:36,914
Guard 2: All right, but I'm gonna tell the boss!

1944
01:06:36,914 --> 01:06:39,236
Guard: Fine! I don't get this chance very often!

1945
01:06:39,236 --> 01:06:45,251
Liam: I wave off from the alley that I snuck in to.

1946
01:06:45,251 --> 01:06:47,356
Vex: Yeah, yeah, go do your shit.

1947
01:06:47,356 --> 01:06:49,435
Vax: You do your shit, that you do!

1948
01:06:50,514 --> 01:06:53,982
Matt: All right. In the meantime, Tiberius.

1949
01:06:53,982 --> 01:06:55,732
Vax: Then I go back, to the shadows.

1950
01:06:55,732 --> 01:06:57,208
Laura: Dammit!

1951
01:06:57,208 --> 01:06:59,494
Matt: You ask around, and it takes a while,

1952
01:06:59,494 --> 01:07:01,120
especially since as a dragonborn some folks are like,

1953
01:07:01,120 --> 01:07:03,184
“Oh, I'm not talking to you!"

1954
01:07:03,184 --> 01:07:05,827
Some others are like, "Oh, yeah, right over that way!”

1955
01:07:05,827 --> 01:07:07,888
And it's a completely wrong direction, so it takes you

1956
01:07:07,888 --> 01:07:12,397
a good two hours to eventually find your way to House Thunderbrand.

1957
01:07:12,397 --> 01:07:14,260
When you get there, it's a beautiful,

1958
01:07:14,260 --> 01:07:15,940
beautiful alabaster building.

1959
01:07:15,940 --> 01:07:17,789
Large, white dome, with small spires

1960
01:07:17,789 --> 01:07:19,334
built in to one of the more elevated

1961
01:07:19,334 --> 01:07:23,592
ceilings of Kraghammer proper.

1962
01:07:23,592 --> 01:07:24,832
You can see on the outside,

1963
01:07:24,832 --> 01:07:27,979
there is no gate, just an open lawn.

1964
01:07:27,979 --> 01:07:30,549
You see grass, you see what looks

1965
01:07:30,549 --> 01:07:34,122
like normally outside flora and fauna currently

1966
01:07:34,122 --> 01:07:37,906
adorning the scape around this structure.

1967
01:07:37,906 --> 01:07:41,524
Tiberius: Woah. Well, this is a lovely sight!

1968
01:07:41,524 --> 01:07:44,697
Orion: I'm gonna saunter on up to the door!

1969
01:07:50,408 --> 01:07:51,160
Matt: Nice! Go ahead and make a perception check.

1970
01:07:53,716 --> 01:07:58,912
Orion: Where is my perception...? Oh. Five.

1971
01:07:58,912 --> 01:08:02,015
Matt: Five? You saunter right up to the edge of the grass line,

1972
01:08:02,015 --> 01:08:03,651
and get one step on what suddenly becomes visible to you.

1973
01:08:03,651 --> 01:08:09,271
A rather subtly carved dwarven rune in the ground.

1974
01:08:09,271 --> 01:08:10,360
In fact, there's a bunch of them,

1975
01:08:10,360 --> 01:08:12,173
outlining the entirety of the grass.

1976
01:08:12,173 --> 01:08:13,329
Matt: As your foot hits the rune, you're like:

1977
01:08:13,329 --> 01:08:15,420
Matt (as Tiberius): Oh, that's a dwarven rune!

1978
01:08:15,420 --> 01:08:16,570
(stomp noise)

1979
01:08:16,570 --> 01:08:17,897
Sam: That's a good voice!

1980
01:08:17,897 --> 01:08:19,046
(all laugh)

1981
01:08:19,046 --> 01:08:21,204
Matt: (as Tiberius) I've been practicing my Tiberius.

1982
01:08:21,204 --> 01:08:22,322
Orion: It's close.

1983
01:08:22,322 --> 01:08:27,658
Matt: (laughs) Go ahead and roll a dexterity saving throw.

1984
01:08:27,658 --> 01:08:30,017
Travis: Uh-oh. Saving throw?

1985
01:08:30,017 --> 01:08:32,236
Laura: You got it, you got it, you got it, Tiberius!

1986
01:08:32,236 --> 01:08:33,241
Orion: Wha-um, what is this?

1987
01:08:33,241 --> 01:08:34,561
Marisha: Dexterity.

1988
01:08:34,561 --> 01:08:36,676
Orion: Oh! That's a fifteen.

1989
01:08:36,676 --> 01:08:37,588
Matt: Fifteen?

1990
01:08:37,588 --> 01:08:38,760
Orion: Mmm hmm.

1991
01:08:38,760 --> 01:08:44,919
Matt: All right! You manage to pull back to lessen the impact,

1992
01:08:44,919 --> 01:08:47,179
but a bolt of bluish energy bursts out

1993
01:08:47,179 --> 01:08:48,194
from the rune in front of you,

1994
01:08:48,194 --> 01:08:50,524
throwing you about three or four feet behind the rune.

1995
01:08:50,524 --> 01:08:51,816
You catch yourself.

1996
01:08:51,816 --> 01:08:53,545
You do suffer eight points of thunder damage.

1997
01:08:53,545 --> 01:08:54,892
Orion: Okay.

1998
01:08:54,892 --> 01:08:56,785
Marisha: Damn gated communities.

1999
01:08:56,785 --> 01:08:58,594
(Matt, Laura, and Travis chuckle)

2000
01:08:58,594 --> 01:09:00,167
Sam: This is why we go to brothels

2001
01:09:00,167 --> 01:09:03,032
instead of sneaking around at night!

2002
01:09:03,032 --> 01:09:04,783
Travis: Yup! No lightning attacks!

2003
01:09:04,783 --> 01:09:07,126
Matt: It's a whole different kind of damage you can suffer!

2004
01:09:07,126 --> 01:09:10,064
Orion: Okay. Well I dust myself off.

2005
01:09:10,064 --> 01:09:13,066
Tiberius: Apparently, there’s some security.

2006
01:09:13,066 --> 01:09:14,963
Hello?!

2007
01:09:14,963 --> 01:09:17,364
Orion: Anything happen?

2008
01:09:17,364 --> 01:09:19,062
Matt: You wait about two or three minutes, no response.

2009
01:09:19,062 --> 01:09:22,340
Orion: 'Two to three minutes'? That's a long time.

2010
01:09:22,340 --> 01:09:23,106
Matt: Yeah.

2011
01:09:23,106 --> 01:09:27,400
Marisha: I have a feeling they're not gonna respond to the crazy guy.

2012
01:09:27,400 --> 01:09:29,378
Tiberius: Very well.

2013
01:09:29,378 --> 01:09:30,516
Travis: What're you two doing?

2014
01:09:30,516 --> 01:09:34,331
Percy and Keyleth: We're making comment cards! Yes!

2015
01:09:34,331 --> 01:09:35,345
Percy: You're all going to have comment cards

2016
01:09:35,345 --> 01:09:39,719
that you are expected to fill out when you return back to the bar!

2017
01:09:39,719 --> 01:09:41,885
Sam: Hugely important! Hugely important!

2018
01:09:41,885 --> 01:09:43,576
Marisha: Yes, 'cause - what was it? Baldus, Beldus?

2019
01:09:43,576 --> 01:09:44,396
Sam: Balgus?

2020
01:09:44,396 --> 01:09:45,939
Travis: Ballsack!

2021
01:09:45,939 --> 01:09:47,264
Marisha: Balan! Balan was so nice!

2022
01:09:47,264 --> 01:09:48,847
Matt: There we go. Balgus and Balan.

2023
01:09:48,847 --> 01:09:53,356
Orion: Do I see - what do I see around the place?

2024
01:09:53,356 --> 01:09:57,335
Do I see any large rocks, or any large pillars that I can...?

2025
01:09:57,335 --> 01:10:02,040
Matt: Best from what you can tell at this distance

2026
01:10:02,040 --> 01:10:04,845
because it's fairly dark down here.

2027
01:10:04,845 --> 01:10:07,259
You can see that the building itself just has

2028
01:10:07,259 --> 01:10:09,848
four corner spires around the large central dome structure.

2029
01:10:09,848 --> 01:10:11,951
Each one of these spires is a very very thin,

2030
01:10:11,951 --> 01:10:14,510
tall alabaster spire that at the very top

2031
01:10:14,510 --> 01:10:18,099
is crested with some sort of bluish crystal that comes to a point.

2032
01:10:18,099 --> 01:10:21,312
They're probably a good 35, 40 feet tall.

2033
01:10:21,312 --> 01:10:23,266
About as tall as the rest of the structure is.

2034
01:10:23,266 --> 01:10:24,195
Orion: Okay.

2035
01:10:24,195 --> 01:10:25,927
Matt: You can't really tell how far back the structure goes because,

2036
01:10:25,927 --> 01:10:28,652
again it meets with the back of the cave wall.

2037
01:10:28,652 --> 01:10:38,269
Orion: I'm going to… okay. I'm gonna shoot a fireball.

2038
01:10:38,269 --> 01:10:41,844
Just… right in front of me kind of like…

2039
01:10:41,844 --> 01:10:43,278
roll it like a bowling ball.

2040
01:10:43,278 --> 01:10:45,451
Just right to the door.

2041
01:10:45,451 --> 01:10:46,710
Matt: Okay.

2042
01:10:46,710 --> 01:10:48,263
Orion: There is a baby right there.

2043
01:10:48,263 --> 01:10:49,619
Matt: You are 4 feet from the door.

2044
01:10:49,619 --> 01:10:50,741
Orion: Oh! I'm 4 feet from the door?

2045
01:10:50,741 --> 01:10:53,955
Orion: I don't do that. I don't do that.

2046
01:10:53,955 --> 01:10:54,859
(laughter)

2047
01:10:54,859 --> 01:10:55,913
Matt: You can step back and do it.

2048
01:10:55,913 --> 01:10:57,174
Orion: I'm only 4 feet from the door? Oh.

2049
01:10:57,174 --> 01:10:58,580
Matt: Like, it pushed you back 4 feet

2050
01:10:58,580 --> 01:11:00,025
from the rune you stepped on.

2051
01:11:00,025 --> 01:11:01,204
You're not at the door.

2052
01:11:01,204 --> 01:11:04,193
Laura: Can I use that magical earring that we have?

2053
01:11:04,193 --> 01:11:05,255
Liam: You don't know what's going on!

2054
01:11:05,255 --> 01:11:06,379
You don't know what's going on there!

2055
01:11:06,379 --> 01:11:07,942
Sam: Episode one. Tiberius kills himself.

2056
01:11:07,942 --> 01:11:08,689
(all laugh)

2057
01:11:08,689 --> 01:11:10,166
Marisha: Don’t die! Don’t die.

2058
01:11:10,166 --> 01:11:12,219
Marisha: I should have come with you! And then I could...

2059
01:11:12,219 --> 01:11:13,696
Travis: Bowl that fireball, dude!

2060
01:11:13,696 --> 01:11:15,853
Marisha: You can't be left alone, dammit!

2061
01:11:15,853 --> 01:11:20,108
Matt: Everyone is level 9 currently in the game.

2062
01:11:20,108 --> 01:11:24,355
Orion: I use… mage hand. And I knock on the door.

2063
01:11:24,355 --> 01:11:28,405
Matt: From that far away? Okay, the mage hand creates -

2064
01:11:28,405 --> 01:11:30,714
the arcane energy swirls up and forms this,

2065
01:11:30,714 --> 01:11:33,514
loosely hand-like appendage that drifts foward.

2066
01:11:33,514 --> 01:11:35,886
As soon as it crosses over the rune where you stepped on,

2067
01:11:35,886 --> 01:11:39,050
there is a spark of energy and the hand is dispelled.

2068
01:11:39,050 --> 01:11:43,096
Tiberius: Damn these runes. Okay, fine.

2069
01:11:43,096 --> 01:11:45,419
I will do glacial blast right up to the door.

2070
01:11:45,419 --> 01:11:47,230
Matt: Okay.

2071
01:11:47,230 --> 01:11:48,402
Orion: But not to the door.

2072
01:11:48,402 --> 01:11:49,313
Marisha: What?

2073
01:11:49,313 --> 01:11:50,951
Sam: You’re alone.

2074
01:11:50,951 --> 01:11:53,025
Matt: Okay. So as you cast the glacial blast forward

2075
01:11:53,025 --> 01:11:55,367
the ice begins to congeal across the bottom of the floor.

2076
01:11:55,367 --> 01:11:57,555
As it reaches the front of the rune,

2077
01:11:57,555 --> 01:11:58,853
there is another spark of energy

2078
01:11:58,853 --> 01:12:01,951
and the ice forms up against an invisible barrier

2079
01:12:01,951 --> 01:12:03,801
that's there and then the ice that's up against the barrier

2080
01:12:03,801 --> 01:12:07,140
melts extremely quickly, drifting into a puddle of water.

2081
01:12:07,140 --> 01:12:10,147
Orion: Shit. I turn back and head to the group.

2082
01:12:10,147 --> 01:12:13,541
Matt: Okay. As you turn around there are four Carvers

2083
01:12:13,541 --> 01:12:16,097
that are hurrying towards you now,

2084
01:12:16,097 --> 01:12:17,953
with their hammers out, going:

2085
01:12:17,953 --> 01:12:19,807
Carver: “You! YOU!”

2086
01:12:19,807 --> 01:12:21,742
Tiberius: What?

2087
01:12:21,742 --> 01:12:23,080
Matt: They all surround you on all sides,

2088
01:12:23,080 --> 01:12:24,496
you have a dwarf on each corner.

2089
01:12:24,496 --> 01:12:25,698
Carver: You have attacked one of the great

2090
01:12:25,698 --> 01:12:27,931
Dwarven families of Kraghammer!

2091
01:12:27,931 --> 01:12:30,811
Name yourself and your business before you are under arrest.

2092
01:12:30,811 --> 01:12:31,860
Tiberius: Don't speak to me in that manner,

2093
01:12:31,860 --> 01:12:34,322
I am Tiberius Stormwind!

2094
01:12:34,322 --> 01:12:36,683
Sam: I am snoring after having sex.

2095
01:12:36,683 --> 01:12:37,610
(all laugh)

2096
01:12:37,610 --> 01:12:40,810
Matt: Make intimidation check.

2097
01:12:42,690 --> 01:12:43,951
Orion: 18.

2098
01:12:43,951 --> 01:12:46,509
Laura: (gasps)

2099
01:12:46,509 --> 01:12:52,132
Matt:. All four Carvers take a step back, look at each other.

2100
01:12:52,132 --> 01:12:56,168
Carver: Look, we're just doing our job. What's your business?

2101
01:12:56,168 --> 01:12:59,648
Tiberius: I understand that, and I am sorry for losing my temper.

2102
01:12:59,648 --> 01:13:03,344
But I was just looking to ask questions of particular artifacts

2103
01:13:03,344 --> 01:13:05,722
I have been looking for and this house is the only known

2104
01:13:05,722 --> 01:13:08,593
arcane house I know that I was pointed to.

2105
01:13:08,593 --> 01:13:11,354
I tried to reach them and communicate but I was stopped

2106
01:13:11,354 --> 01:13:13,885
by the stupid rune I can't figure out!

2107
01:13:13,885 --> 01:13:15,236
So I was turning back to get my tavern to

2108
01:13:15,236 --> 01:13:17,596
get some rest and, you know, come back and try to contact

2109
01:13:17,596 --> 01:13:21,352
the family the next day! And then I was stopped by you!

2110
01:13:21,352 --> 01:13:24,382
Matt: Make a persuasion check.

2111
01:13:26,794 --> 01:13:28,835
Orion: 24.

2112
01:13:28,835 --> 01:13:29,888
Liam: I've just arrived to New York City,

2113
01:13:29,888 --> 01:13:31,329
I'm going to smash the doors open -

2114
01:13:31,329 --> 01:13:33,881
(all laugh)

2115
01:13:33,881 --> 01:13:37,044
Matt: The dwarf guards look at each other and he goes -

2116
01:13:37,044 --> 01:13:38,900
one of them steps forward and this guy you can see now

2117
01:13:38,900 --> 01:13:40,700
he has more carvings in his armor,

2118
01:13:40,700 --> 01:13:42,407
he looks to have a little more rank than the other ones.

2119
01:13:42,407 --> 01:13:45,526
He steps forward, ruddy brown beard, his eyes itself

2120
01:13:45,526 --> 01:13:48,131
are pitch black. There is almost no color to the irises.

2121
01:13:48,131 --> 01:13:49,126
And he goes:

2122
01:13:49,126 --> 01:13:51,955
Carver 2: Look. I'm letting you off this once.

2123
01:13:51,955 --> 01:13:54,287
But if you so much as spit in the direction

2124
01:13:54,287 --> 01:13:56,094
of any other dwarf in the city,

2125
01:13:56,094 --> 01:13:58,913
we're going to bury you so far underneath the dungeon

2126
01:13:58,913 --> 01:14:01,582
you won't see the light of day 'til the day you rot,

2127
01:14:01,582 --> 01:14:03,309
you hear me, Dragonborn?

2128
01:14:03,309 --> 01:14:05,402
Tiberius: I mean yes, my hearing is perfectly fine.

2129
01:14:05,402 --> 01:14:07,179
(all laugh)

2130
01:14:07,179 --> 01:14:08,941
Matt: Kind of like, “Get on with you,”

2131
01:14:08,941 --> 01:14:10,218
he puts his hammer back at his side,

2132
01:14:10,218 --> 01:14:13,692
they all separate, stare you down as you walk past.

2133
01:14:13,692 --> 01:14:15,705
Tiberius: Good day.

2134
01:14:15,705 --> 01:14:17,713
(all laugh)

2135
01:14:17,713 --> 01:14:19,121
Orion: Back to the tavern.

2136
01:14:19,121 --> 01:14:21,217
Matt: Okay. You!

2137
01:14:21,217 --> 01:14:22,622
Liam: Yes?

2138
01:14:22,622 --> 01:14:23,964
Matt: You go ahead and make your way through the alleyways,

2139
01:14:23,964 --> 01:14:26,415
eventually back towards the building proper.

2140
01:14:26,415 --> 01:14:27,543
What would you like to do?

2141
01:14:27,543 --> 01:14:28,864
Liam: Just gonna watch, that's all.

2142
01:14:28,864 --> 01:14:31,349
Do I see any security details?

2143
01:14:31,349 --> 01:14:32,883
See who's guarding the place.

2144
01:14:32,883 --> 01:14:34,837
Laura: (whispering) Your perception is shit, how are you going to…?

2145
01:14:34,837 --> 01:14:38,261
Matt: There are Carvers doing rounds around the city.

2146
01:14:38,261 --> 01:14:41,372
On the streets just wandering through in pairs, keeping watch.

2147
01:14:41,372 --> 01:14:43,807
You don't see any particular guard outside,

2148
01:14:43,807 --> 01:14:46,012
but you do see individuals moving past windows.

2149
01:14:46,012 --> 01:14:48,772
There's a little bit of light from the inside of the buildings.

2150
01:14:48,772 --> 01:14:51,585
Liam: No Carvers or any sort of guard detail outside the house?

2151
01:14:51,585 --> 01:14:52,872
Anything like that?

2152
01:14:52,872 --> 01:14:56,575
Matt: Not through the gates. The yard area and to the front door.

2153
01:14:56,575 --> 01:14:59,284
Liam: Okay. But heavily heavily guarded by the looks of

2154
01:14:59,284 --> 01:15:02,049
what's inside and what's outside the gate?

2155
01:15:02,049 --> 01:15:04,658
Matt: What's outside the gate? You're hard pressed

2156
01:15:04,658 --> 01:15:06,694
to find a moment where the street isn't visible to some Carver.

2157
01:15:07,315 --> 01:15:08,620
This area is pretty well guarded.

2158
01:15:08,620 --> 01:15:09,784
You figure largely because the person who is

2159
01:15:09,784 --> 01:15:11,562
currently the Ironkeeper of the entire city of Kraghammer

2160
01:15:11,562 --> 01:15:13,473
ives with that building as well as

2161
01:15:14,145 --> 01:15:15,648
one of the more powerful dwarven families,

2162
01:15:15,648 --> 01:15:17,585
so it's pretty well watched.

2163
01:15:17,585 --> 01:15:19,605
Vax: Okay, I'm just going to head back to the inn then.

2164
01:15:19,605 --> 01:15:20,761
Matt: Okay.

2165
01:15:20,761 --> 01:15:22,058
Vax: I'm not going to poke the bear.

2166
01:15:22,058 --> 01:15:25,949
Matt: You all eventually gather back at the tavern.

2167
01:15:25,949 --> 01:15:27,253
Scanlan: (exhausted sigh) How was your night?

2168
01:15:27,253 --> 01:15:29,811
Grog: That was wonderful, I don't know about you!

2169
01:15:29,811 --> 01:15:31,682
Scanlan: (singsong) I have hickies.

2170
01:15:31,682 --> 01:15:34,549
(all laugh)

2171
01:15:34,549 --> 01:15:37,753
Liam: Hickies? is that a Gnomish STD?

2172
01:15:37,753 --> 01:15:40,724
Sam: Yes.

2173
01:15:40,724 --> 01:15:45,675
Vex: Crazy! I have some hickies too, actually.

2174
01:15:45,675 --> 01:15:46,744
Vex: What?

2175
01:15:46,744 --> 01:15:47,091
Scanlan: What?

2176
01:15:47,091 --> 01:15:49,139
Percy: And we have comment cards

2177
01:15:49,139 --> 01:15:50,736
so this will all work out well.

2178
01:15:50,736 --> 01:15:52,604
Keyleth: Yes! here! Here you go, here you go...

2179
01:15:52,604 --> 01:15:53,994
Scanlan: Success all around!

2180
01:15:53,994 --> 01:15:55,063
Did you learn anything Vex and Vax?

2181
01:15:55,063 --> 01:15:58,850
Vax: I definitely think we should take the, er, diplomacy route.

2182
01:15:58,850 --> 01:16:00,315
The place is heavily guarded.

2183
01:16:00,315 --> 01:16:01,877
There seem to be lots of Carvers.

2184
01:16:01,877 --> 01:16:03,567
Matt: (knocks on the table)

2185
01:16:03,567 --> 01:16:06,813
There's a knock at the room that you guys

2186
01:16:06,813 --> 01:16:08,105
are currently talking in.

2187
01:16:08,105 --> 01:16:08,571
Vex: Yes.

2188
01:16:08,571 --> 01:16:10,218
Matt: Unless, are you in the tavern proper

2189
01:16:10,218 --> 01:16:11,492
or have you gone back to - ?

2190
01:16:11,492 --> 01:16:13,152
Laura: No no, we're in a room.

2191
01:16:13,152 --> 01:16:14,380
Scanlan: I'll get it!

2192
01:16:14,380 --> 01:16:17,135
(clears throat) Hello?

2193
01:16:17,135 --> 01:16:18,269
Matt: Adra's standing there looking a little nervous and she goes:

2194
01:16:18,269 --> 01:16:22,364
Adra: Hi, sorry to bother you. Is that… bear one of yours?

2195
01:16:22,364 --> 01:16:23,563
Scanlan: Oh!

2196
01:16:23,563 --> 01:16:27,279
Vex: Yes! Trinket! Isn't he adorable?

2197
01:16:27,279 --> 01:16:29,395
Adra: You might want to go -

2198
01:16:29,395 --> 01:16:30,716
Matt: And you hear in the tavern:

2199
01:16:30,716 --> 01:16:32,449
Trinket: (aggravated growls)

2200
01:16:32,449 --> 01:16:35,072
Vex: I'll be right back. I head downstairs.

2201
01:16:35,072 --> 01:16:37,037
Matt: You head downstairs and you can see

2202
01:16:37,037 --> 01:16:38,313
all the dwarves are now gathered around the fighting ring

2203
01:16:38,313 --> 01:16:39,516
in the center of the tavern.

2204
01:16:39,516 --> 01:16:39,900
Laura: Oh no!

2205
01:16:39,900 --> 01:16:42,127
Matt: And Trinket’s now inside the ring

2206
01:16:42,127 --> 01:16:43,255
with a couple other dwarves around,

2207
01:16:43,255 --> 01:16:44,840
just prodding and pushing it into the ring.

2208
01:16:44,840 --> 01:16:48,271
Vex: No-no, no, no, NO.

2209
01:16:48,271 --> 01:16:49,051
Travis: (laughs)

2210
01:16:49,051 --> 01:16:49,551
Marisha: Oh my god.

2211
01:16:49,551 --> 01:16:51,186
Matt: There’s raucous cheering.

2212
01:16:51,186 --> 01:16:52,908
They're not even listening to you at this point.

2213
01:16:52,908 --> 01:16:54,406
Vex: (Grunts in frustration) GROG!

2214
01:16:54,406 --> 01:16:55,782
Vax: I followed my sister downstairs.

2215
01:16:55,782 --> 01:16:57,684
Grog: I come down too. (singsong) It’s party time!

2216
01:16:57,684 --> 01:16:59,182
Keyleth: I run down to with Grog.

2217
01:16:59,182 --> 01:16:59,432
Percy: Oh, I'm following down.

2218
01:16:59,432 --> 01:17:01,338
Matt: Okay, as you guys head down you can see now,

2219
01:17:01,338 --> 01:17:04,747
Balgus is now up and rubbing his chin.

2220
01:17:04,747 --> 01:17:09,020
Balgus: Oh, never fought a bear before! (laughs)

2221
01:17:09,020 --> 01:17:11,163
Vex: No no, Balgus! Balgus! Fuck! Trinket, come here!

2222
01:17:11,163 --> 01:17:12,224
Laura: Are we allowed to cuss?

2223
01:17:12,224 --> 01:17:13,471
Vex: Trinket, come here!

2224
01:17:13,471 --> 01:17:13,851
Matt: You are very much allowed to cuss.

2225
01:17:13,851 --> 01:17:15,833
Laura: Okay.

2226
01:17:15,833 --> 01:17:17,520
Matt: Isn't that right guys? Fuck yeah!

2227
01:17:17,520 --> 01:17:18,106
Marisha: (laughs)

2228
01:17:18,106 --> 01:17:21,321
Vex: No no, no no, and I run into the ring with him.

2229
01:17:21,321 --> 01:17:22,643
Matt: Okay, as you run into the ring

2230
01:17:22,643 --> 01:17:24,187
a couple of the dwarves pat you on the back,

2231
01:17:24,187 --> 01:17:25,861
you get a shove into the ring.

2232
01:17:25,861 --> 01:17:26,342
Vex: (grunts)

2233
01:17:26,342 --> 01:17:28,540
Matt: It’s now Trinket and you...

2234
01:17:28,540 --> 01:17:31,793
Vex: Oh! I'll take on this bear!

2235
01:17:31,793 --> 01:17:36,273
(all laugh)

2236
01:17:36,273 --> 01:17:38,504
Sam: What?

2237
01:17:38,504 --> 01:17:39,535
Taliesin: Well, all right!

2238
01:17:39,535 --> 01:17:40,690
Matt: Make a general charisma check.

2239
01:17:40,690 --> 01:17:42,415
Travis: (laughing) Do it! Fuck that bear up!

2240
01:17:42,415 --> 01:17:45,020
Vax: I'm pushing my way through the crowd.

2241
01:17:45,020 --> 01:17:46,365
Laura: Oh no! Oh no.

2242
01:17:46,365 --> 01:17:46,865
Matt: What did you roll?

2243
01:17:46,865 --> 01:17:48,682
Liam: A one.

2244
01:17:48,682 --> 01:17:50,353
(all laugh)

2245
01:17:50,353 --> 01:17:50,708
Marisha: Oh no!

2246
01:17:50,708 --> 01:17:50,958
Matt: Yes!

2247
01:17:50,958 --> 01:17:54,638
Liam: First one of the series everybody! First one!

2248
01:17:54,638 --> 01:17:55,953
Matt: So, as you rush and you guys

2249
01:17:55,953 --> 01:17:57,899
are coming to the front you see -

2250
01:17:57,899 --> 01:18:00,753
Balgus sees this and now you can see both eyes are open

2251
01:18:00,753 --> 01:18:02,043
which means he's sobered up a bit, and he goes:

2252
01:18:02,043 --> 01:18:06,240
Balgus: Oh no! This bear's mine.

2253
01:18:06,240 --> 01:18:08,577
You wanna fight two of us?

2254
01:18:08,577 --> 01:18:10,494
Oh, it'll wake ya right up!

2255
01:18:10,494 --> 01:18:12,318
Vex: Let’s do it!

2256
01:18:12,318 --> 01:18:14,271
Balgus: Nothing as invigorating as as a brawl!

2257
01:18:14,271 --> 01:18:15,627
Sam: Are you going to fucking fight him?

2258
01:18:15,627 --> 01:18:17,934
Keyleth: I cast a fog. Over the ring.

2259
01:18:18,273 --> 01:18:21,461
Matt: Okay. As everyone is cheering up and getting ready

2260
01:18:21,461 --> 01:18:26,090
This very thick fog begins to fill the center of the bar area.

2261
01:18:26,090 --> 01:18:27,109
You can now see a bunch of people are:

2262
01:18:27,109 --> 01:18:28,441
Bar Patron: Wait, what the...?

2263
01:18:28,441 --> 01:18:29,942
(cough)

2264
01:18:29,942 --> 01:18:32,312
Bar Patron: What the hell's goin' on?

2265
01:18:32,312 --> 01:18:34,545
Fuckin' 'ell why - why is there...

2266
01:18:34,545 --> 01:18:37,698
Keyleth: Okay, I run up in the fog, and I tap Trinket

2267
01:18:37,698 --> 01:18:40,247
and I whisper in Trinket's ear and I say:

2268
01:18:40,247 --> 01:18:41,693
“Trinket, I'm tapping you out.”

2269
01:18:41,693 --> 01:18:44,522
And I turn into a bear like Trinket!

2270
01:18:44,522 --> 01:18:44,953
Sam: What?!

2271
01:18:44,953 --> 01:18:46,211
Travis: Good!

2272
01:18:46,211 --> 01:18:47,408
Matt: Okay.

2273
01:18:47,408 --> 01:18:48,635
Keyleth: And I - wait, wait.

2274
01:18:48,635 --> 01:18:50,406
First I polymorph Trinket into a squirrel.

2275
01:18:50,406 --> 01:18:51,468
Laura: (gasp) You can do that?

2276
01:18:51,468 --> 01:18:52,182
Marisha: I can.

2277
01:18:52,182 --> 01:18:53,464
Matt: All right.

2278
01:18:53,464 --> 01:18:54,732
Orrion: Oh, you can do polymorph?

2279
01:18:54,732 --> 01:18:56,037
Keyleth: No no no no, a mouse, like a rat.

2280
01:18:56,037 --> 01:18:57,210
Laura: Little tiny -

2281
01:18:57,210 --> 01:19:01,227
Matt: Okay. So you see the shadows nearby the fog you hear:

2282
01:19:01,227 --> 01:19:02,474
Balgus: Come at me, I’m gonna - (slaps table)

2283
01:19:02,474 --> 01:19:03,768
Matt: You can see Balgus' shadow

2284
01:19:03,768 --> 01:19:05,838
just swinging wildly at the air, angrily.

2285
01:19:05,838 --> 01:19:06,942
Sam: We gonna fight him?

2286
01:19:06,942 --> 01:19:08,284
Laura: I don't know!

2287
01:19:08,284 --> 01:19:09,911
Matt: You go ahead, you grab Trinket. Trinket shrinks down

2288
01:19:09,911 --> 01:19:11,441
into a tiny little mouse.

2289
01:19:11,441 --> 01:19:15,631
Keyleth: I say, “Scanlan, Scanlan! Catch Trinket!”

2290
01:19:15,631 --> 01:19:19,563
Scanlan: Jesus I don't like rats but I'll keep it. Okay.

2291
01:19:19,563 --> 01:19:20,868
Matt: Trinket, the little mouse face,

2292
01:19:20,868 --> 01:19:21,915
the moment you see it,

2293
01:19:21,915 --> 01:19:25,230
looks very confused, very scared.

2294
01:19:25,230 --> 01:19:27,189
Scanlan: Its okay, its okay. I'll protect it.

2295
01:19:27,189 --> 01:19:28,526
Don't worry.

2296
01:19:28,526 --> 01:19:29,646
Keyleth: And then I bear form up.

2297
01:19:29,646 --> 01:19:30,992
Matt: You (whoosh) into a bear form.

2298
01:19:30,992 --> 01:19:33,684
Now Keyleth is now this giant bear where Trinket once was.

2299
01:19:33,684 --> 01:19:35,566
Grog: I got my money on Ballsack!

2300
01:19:35,566 --> 01:19:37,603
(all laugh)

2301
01:19:37,603 --> 01:19:38,840
Scanlan: Don't bet against the enemy!

2302
01:19:38,840 --> 01:19:40,261
Vax: In the fog I somersault over some

2303
01:19:40,261 --> 01:19:42,875
random dwarf and pull out my dagger,

2304
01:19:42,875 --> 01:19:44,030
but turn it around in my hand and

2305
01:19:44,030 --> 01:19:46,954
whack Balgus in the back of the head

2306
01:19:46,954 --> 01:19:48,763
as hard as I can, just to try and knock him out.

2307
01:19:48,763 --> 01:19:49,696
Sam: Oh shit!

2308
01:19:49,696 --> 01:19:50,729
Laura: Can you see in fog?

2309
01:19:50,729 --> 01:19:52,143
Sam: He's a really good fighter.

2310
01:19:52,143 --> 01:19:53,281
Liam: Low light.

2311
01:19:53,281 --> 01:19:54,636
Matt: Go ahead and make a stealth check.

2312
01:19:54,636 --> 01:19:55,851
Laura: What?!

2313
01:19:55,851 --> 01:19:58,325
Matt: You have advantage because you are in fog.

2314
01:19:58,325 --> 01:19:59,248
Orion: I'm at the balcony by the way.

2315
01:19:59,248 --> 01:20:00,505
Watching all this.

2316
01:20:00,505 --> 01:20:01,742
Laura: You have advantage, you have advantage, roll twice.

2317
01:20:01,742 --> 01:20:03,388
Liam (partially sung): Oh, thank you.

2318
01:20:03,388 --> 01:20:04,925
Travis: Yeah, we're watching what they're doing.

2319
01:20:04,925 --> 01:20:06,881
Scanlan: Remember, he's our friend. We don't want to kill him.

2320
01:20:06,881 --> 01:20:08,544
Orion: I'm taking a short rest.

2321
01:20:08,544 --> 01:20:09,690
I'm taking a short rest, you all can do this.

2322
01:20:09,690 --> 01:20:10,944
Liam: 21.

2323
01:20:10,944 --> 01:20:12,277
Matt: Okay. Balgus's drunken, mist covered state does not seem

2324
01:20:12,277 --> 01:20:14,232
to notice your approach. He is swinging wildly though.

2325
01:20:14,232 --> 01:20:17,135
He has a disadvantage attack on you as you approach.

2326
01:20:17,135 --> 01:20:17,813
Travis: He's rolling.

2327
01:20:17,813 --> 01:20:19,132
You're fucked, he's rolling.

2328
01:20:19,132 --> 01:20:21,157
Matt: One of his fists just swings past you.

2329
01:20:21,157 --> 01:20:23,516
That is going to be a twelve,

2330
01:20:23,516 --> 01:20:24,218
I don't think that hits.

2331
01:20:24,218 --> 01:20:25,207
Liam: No.

2332
01:20:25,207 --> 01:20:26,376
Matt: You just - (whoosh) - narrowly dodge out of the way.

2333
01:20:26,376 --> 01:20:30,569
You can feel the fist just whoosh past one of your ears.

2334
01:20:30,569 --> 01:20:31,493
Laura: Like in the Matrix!

2335
01:20:31,493 --> 01:20:32,930
Matt: As you come back up, clutching the base of your dagger,

2336
01:20:32,930 --> 01:20:34,482
go ahead and go for your strike.

2337
01:20:34,482 --> 01:20:35,702
Laura: Oh my gosh!

2338
01:20:35,702 --> 01:20:37,049
Travis: Come on taint putter, you got it.

2339
01:20:37,049 --> 01:20:40,539
Liam: So, oh, that's no good.

2340
01:20:40,539 --> 01:20:41,542
Laura: (whispered to Liam) Roll twice.

2341
01:20:41,542 --> 01:20:43,085
(loudly to Matt) Does he have advantage still?

2342
01:20:43,085 --> 01:20:44,570
Liam: Oh, I have advantage on the attack roll for this?

2343
01:20:44,570 --> 01:20:45,872
Matt: Because he does not see you, yes.

2344
01:20:45,872 --> 01:20:47,189
Liam: Yes. Oh, thank Christ.

2345
01:20:47,189 --> 01:20:47,446
Matt: You are currently stealthed.

2346
01:20:47,446 --> 01:20:48,978
Laura: Much better!

2347
01:20:48,978 --> 01:20:50,269
Liam: That's much better. 26!

2348
01:20:50,269 --> 01:20:51,664
Travis: That'll work. (laughs)

2349
01:20:51,664 --> 01:20:53,306
Taliesin: That'll hit.

2350
01:20:53,306 --> 01:20:55,480
Matt: So go ahead and roll sneak attack damage on this, of course.

2351
01:20:55,480 --> 01:20:56,425
Liam: Plus regular?

2352
01:20:56,425 --> 01:20:57,523
Matt: Yeah.

2353
01:20:57,523 --> 01:20:58,975
Scanlan: Don't kill him!

2354
01:20:58,975 --> 01:21:00,290
Matt: Well, we're considering it nonlethal damage

2355
01:21:00,290 --> 01:21:01,511
because it's with the base of the dagger.

2356
01:21:01,511 --> 01:21:02,852
Laura: Bonk, it's blunt!

2357
01:21:02,852 --> 01:21:03,948
Orion: I'm having an ale while watching all this.

2358
01:21:03,948 --> 01:21:06,358
Matt: (to Orion) You're watching a lot of fog,

2359
01:21:06,358 --> 01:21:08,124
with some shapes moving in it.

2360
01:21:08,124 --> 01:21:09,657
Orion: Yeah, and I'm like, "This is fog!"

2361
01:21:09,657 --> 01:21:11,616
Probably Keyleth's spell.

2362
01:21:11,616 --> 01:21:13,370
Laura: I'm blindly looking for Trinket.

2363
01:21:13,370 --> 01:21:14,490
Scanlan: Trinket's in my hands.

2364
01:21:14,490 --> 01:21:16,075
Matt: You're like, "Where's - where's Trinket?"

2365
01:21:16,075 --> 01:21:17,355
And you see a giant bear there

2366
01:21:17,355 --> 01:21:18,976
and you're like, "There's Trinket!

2367
01:21:18,976 --> 01:21:20,529
That's not Trinket. There's no armor.”

2368
01:21:20,529 --> 01:21:21,762
Marisha: Oh, that's right.

2369
01:21:21,762 --> 01:21:22,844
Laura: (reacting to Matt): Oh, yeah!

2370
01:21:22,844 --> 01:21:24,034
And I hug… oh no… what's happening?

2371
01:21:24,034 --> 01:21:25,204
Matt: You're very confused. Trinket now has no armor,

2372
01:21:25,204 --> 01:21:26,199
is a slightly different shade -

2373
01:21:26,199 --> 01:21:27,395
Marisha: No, he's close enough! Man, come on,

2374
01:21:27,395 --> 01:21:28,596
I've been around Trinket enough.

2375
01:21:28,596 --> 01:21:29,764
Orion (imitating Marisha): Come on man!

2376
01:21:29,764 --> 01:21:30,813
Marisha (laughing): Come on man!

2377
01:21:30,813 --> 01:21:32,357
Liam: 27, right in the base of his skull.

2378
01:21:32,357 --> 01:21:33,031
Sam: Jesus.

2379
01:21:33,031 --> 01:21:34,780
Matt: All right. Crack! A resounding impact hits

2380
01:21:34,780 --> 01:21:36,330
and there now dwarves that are like:

2381
01:21:36,330 --> 01:21:36,580
Dwarves: (enthusiastically) Yeah!

2382
01:21:36,580 --> 01:21:39,176
(shocked) Ooooh!

2383
01:21:39,176 --> 01:21:40,252
(all laugh)

2384
01:21:40,252 --> 01:21:41,999
Matt: All the cheering stops and there's this lull.

2385
01:21:41,999 --> 01:21:43,092
Quiet hits.

2386
01:21:43,092 --> 01:21:44,344
Balgus hasn't moved, by the way.

2387
01:21:44,344 --> 01:21:46,680
You impact and it's like hitting a wall.

2388
01:21:46,680 --> 01:21:49,223
And there's this taught, thick stump of muscle

2389
01:21:49,223 --> 01:21:50,711
where the dwarf neck is.

2390
01:21:50,711 --> 01:21:51,805
Liam: No. Fuck!

2391
01:21:51,805 --> 01:21:53,779
Matt: And as you pull back the dagger, his hand reaches up

2392
01:21:53,779 --> 01:21:56,833
and grabs your wrist.

2393
01:21:56,833 --> 01:21:57,698
Laura: Shit, oh my god!

2394
01:21:57,698 --> 01:21:58,493
Travis: Oh shit!

2395
01:21:58,493 --> 01:21:59,620
Matt: His head slowly turns towards you and he goes:

2396
01:21:59,620 --> 01:22:01,551
Balgus: (laughs)

2397
01:22:01,551 --> 01:22:02,597
(all laugh)

2398
01:22:02,597 --> 01:22:04,520
Liam: Bonus action to disengage.

2399
01:22:04,520 --> 01:22:05,476
Laura: Oh no!

2400
01:22:05,476 --> 01:22:06,769
Liam: Disengage as a rogue.

2401
01:22:06,769 --> 01:22:08,102
Matt: Well he's going to attempt to grapple you.

2402
01:22:08,102 --> 01:22:09,190
Laura and Liam: Oh no.

2403
01:22:09,190 --> 01:22:09,940
Sam: Fuck.

2404
01:22:09,940 --> 01:22:12,665
Matt: Go ahead and make either an acrobatics check.

2405
01:22:12,665 --> 01:22:13,598
Go ahead and make an acrobatics check,

2406
01:22:13,598 --> 01:22:14,701
it's probably your best score anyway.

2407
01:22:14,701 --> 01:22:15,786
Liam: All right, all right, all right.

2408
01:22:15,786 --> 01:22:17,107
Oh, that's fine! That's a 30.

2409
01:22:17,107 --> 01:22:17,927
Matt: That's a 30?

2410
01:22:17,927 --> 01:22:18,817
Liam: Yeah.

2411
01:22:18,817 --> 01:22:19,996
Matt: You manage to just slip out of his grip.

2412
01:22:19,996 --> 01:22:20,262
Tavis: You lucky...

2413
01:22:20,262 --> 01:22:22,014
Matt: Barely. He was about to clamp on.

2414
01:22:22,014 --> 01:22:24,281
As you step away, he turns towards you and goes:

2415
01:22:24,281 --> 01:22:26,516
Balgus: Oh, well I feel alive tonight!

2416
01:22:26,516 --> 01:22:27,808
Bring it, all of ya!

2417
01:22:27,808 --> 01:22:30,992
I wanna smash a face in.

2418
01:22:30,992 --> 01:22:32,080
Matt: He's got a little bit of ale froth

2419
01:22:32,080 --> 01:22:33,287
at the corner of his mouth.

2420
01:22:33,287 --> 01:22:34,839
It's beginning to drip into his beard.

2421
01:22:34,839 --> 01:22:36,615
It's quite an awful sight for those that are close enough to see it.

2422
01:22:36,615 --> 01:22:39,417
The rest of you just see this, shapes and movement.

2423
01:22:39,417 --> 01:22:41,934
But there's still this, "O-o-okay, what's going on?" kind of a feel.

2424
01:22:41,934 --> 01:22:43,244
You hear Adra in the back going:

2425
01:22:43,244 --> 01:22:45,404
Adra: Stop this! This is... I can't even see!

2426
01:22:45,404 --> 01:22:46,517
What are you doing?!

2427
01:22:46,517 --> 01:22:48,102
Don't destroy another table!

2428
01:22:48,102 --> 01:22:50,485
Matt: She's frantically trying to stop this chaos.

2429
01:22:50,485 --> 01:22:52,609
There's now a bear…

2430
01:22:52,609 --> 01:22:53,965
what are you doing Keyleth?

2431
01:22:53,965 --> 01:22:56,549
Marisha: I'm a bear… a-a-a-and...

2432
01:22:56,549 --> 01:22:57,483
Matt: You're a bear...

2433
01:22:57,483 --> 01:22:58,871
(all laugh)

2434
01:22:58,871 --> 01:23:00,042
Orion (imitating Marisha): I'm a bear.

2435
01:23:00,042 --> 01:23:01,259
Marisha: Um… what happened?

2436
01:23:01,259 --> 01:23:02,808
Matt: You're a bear, you want to do anything?

2437
01:23:02,808 --> 01:23:03,308
Laura: What are you doing?

2438
01:23:03,308 --> 01:23:04,897
Matt: You see the shape of Balgus just like -

2439
01:23:04,897 --> 01:23:06,781
- in the middle of this fight ring.

2440
01:23:06,781 --> 01:23:08,150
Laura: Do, do some tricks! Do some tricks!

2441
01:23:08,150 --> 01:23:09,466
Start clapping and, like, dancing around.

2442
01:23:09,466 --> 01:23:11,695
Marisha: Okay, okay, that's a good idea.

2443
01:23:11,695 --> 01:23:12,775
Matt: This is what she tells you.

2444
01:23:12,775 --> 01:23:16,615
Marisha: I go...I go... I see her as my trainer.

2445
01:23:16,615 --> 01:23:17,614
Laura (whispering): Dance, dance, dance, dance, dance.

2446
01:23:17,614 --> 01:23:21,004
Marisha: And I'm like - (bear sounds) - I'm circus bear-ing.

2447
01:23:21,004 --> 01:23:21,791
(bear sounds)

2448
01:23:21,791 --> 01:23:23,183
Vex: Everyone! Gather round and watch

2449
01:23:23,183 --> 01:23:25,521
the amazing Trinket do his tricks!

2450
01:23:25,521 --> 01:23:26,465
Liam: Scanlan, let's get some music.

2451
01:23:26,465 --> 01:23:30,265
Sam: I start playing music from my shaum instrument.

2452
01:23:30,265 --> 01:23:31,750
Which exists.

2453
01:23:31,750 --> 01:23:33,262
Matt (laughing): Yeah, it does.

2454
01:23:33,262 --> 01:23:36,120
Sam: A rousing jaunty bear-like tune.

2455
01:23:36,120 --> 01:23:36,667
Laura: Yes!

2456
01:23:36,667 --> 01:23:38,110
Matt: All right.

2457
01:23:38,110 --> 01:23:38,804
Orion: And I'm going to cast prestidigitation

2458
01:23:38,804 --> 01:23:40,041
and do fireworks on top of that.

2459
01:23:40,041 --> 01:23:40,291
Laura: Yes!

2460
01:23:40,291 --> 01:23:42,929
Marisha: You should give me a fez!

2461
01:23:42,929 --> 01:23:43,935
Can you prestidigitation me a fez?

2462
01:23:43,935 --> 01:23:45,152
Orion: Can I do little hats?

2463
01:23:45,152 --> 01:23:46,246
Matt: You haven't done a fez yet. You need to work on that.

2464
01:23:46,246 --> 01:23:47,573
A couple more levels.

2465
01:23:47,573 --> 01:23:49,263
Tiberius: Uh, no. I'll try… paper hat!

2466
01:23:49,263 --> 01:23:50,582
Taliesin: Keep dancing, I don't know why you stopped dancing.

2467
01:23:50,582 --> 01:23:52,683
Matt: So have you ever seen fireworks go off in a cloud?

2468
01:23:52,683 --> 01:23:53,671
You get that little boof, boof.

2469
01:23:53,671 --> 01:23:54,967
Yeah there's a bunch of that above you.

2470
01:23:54,967 --> 01:23:56,277
Cloud, lights flashing.

2471
01:23:56,277 --> 01:23:56,701
Vex: How do we clear the fog?

2472
01:23:56,701 --> 01:23:58,372
Laura: It's just there.

2473
01:23:58,372 --> 01:24:00,501
Marisha: Oh, I, I'll let the cloud… fade.

2474
01:24:00,501 --> 01:24:01,001
Matt: You begin singing your tune.

2475
01:24:01,001 --> 01:24:02,301
Do you give an inspiration dice to her?

2476
01:24:02,301 --> 01:24:03,583
Sam: Sure, I would love to give her an inspiration dice.

2477
01:24:03,583 --> 01:24:04,682
Laura: So the fog fades...

2478
01:24:04,682 --> 01:24:05,885
Matt: So a d8 inspiration dice from the bard

2479
01:24:05,885 --> 01:24:07,933
as you hear the enchanting, jaunty, bear dancing theme.

2480
01:24:07,933 --> 01:24:10,019
Scanlan (singing): Oh look over there! It's a bear! Yeah!

2481
01:24:10,019 --> 01:24:11,208
(all laugh)

2482
01:24:11,208 --> 01:24:11,595
Marisha: (bear sounds)

2483
01:24:11,595 --> 01:24:13,347
Matt: Bard getting his bard on.

2484
01:24:13,347 --> 01:24:14,430
Go ahead and make a performance check.

2485
01:24:14,430 --> 01:24:15,911
Sam: Who, me?

2486
01:24:15,911 --> 01:24:16,341
Matt: No, she does.

2487
01:24:16,341 --> 01:24:18,020
Marisha: Oh, no! It's not a thing that I'm good at.

2488
01:24:18,020 --> 01:24:19,013
Laura: A performance check!

2489
01:24:19,013 --> 01:24:19,513
Sam: What?!

2490
01:24:19,513 --> 01:24:20,697
Matt: You're performing as a bear!

2491
01:24:20,697 --> 01:24:21,605
Taliesin and Marisha: (loudly cheer)

2492
01:24:21,605 --> 01:24:24,146
Marisha: Natural 20!

2493
01:24:24,146 --> 01:24:25,250
(cheering)

2494
01:24:25,250 --> 01:24:27,592
Matt: Do you want to add performance dice?

2495
01:24:27,592 --> 01:24:28,617
Liam: Look at that, a fucking bear dance.

2496
01:24:28,617 --> 01:24:30,217
Matt: I mean, I'm sorry, the inspiration dice that he gave you.

2497
01:24:30,217 --> 01:24:30,603
Sam: No! It's a natural 20!

2498
01:24:30,603 --> 01:24:32,270
Marisha: It's a natural 20!

2499
01:24:32,270 --> 01:24:33,888
Matt: I know, but you could get more. Okay!

2500
01:24:33,888 --> 01:24:35,935
Marisha: No I want to save it! I'm inspired, for later.

2501
01:24:35,935 --> 01:24:37,863
I will think back to that moment.

2502
01:24:37,863 --> 01:24:38,639
Matt: You were so inspired, you weren't even

2503
01:24:38,639 --> 01:24:40,468
inspired to be inspired for this.

2504
01:24:40,468 --> 01:24:41,602
Marisha: Yeah. (sings a circus song)

2505
01:24:41,602 --> 01:24:42,819
Matt: All right, so.

2506
01:24:42,819 --> 01:24:45,856
This array of strange puffy fireworks in the fog;

2507
01:24:45,856 --> 01:24:47,042
you doing this little rotation.

2508
01:24:47,042 --> 01:24:48,499
You actually manage to do a bear cartwheel,

2509
01:24:48,499 --> 01:24:49,653
and slam into the ring,

2510
01:24:49,653 --> 01:24:51,072
but it looks pretty cool.

2511
01:24:51,072 --> 01:24:51,572
Vex: Amazing, amazing!

2512
01:24:51,572 --> 01:24:52,901
Marisha: (bear sounds)

2513
01:24:52,901 --> 01:24:53,952
Matt: You get back up. You're on your hind legs,

2514
01:24:53,952 --> 01:24:55,204
you dance on one foot for a second.

2515
01:24:55,204 --> 01:24:56,465
At which point Balgus is like:

2516
01:24:56,465 --> 01:24:58,414
Balgus: (small laugh)

2517
01:24:58,414 --> 01:25:00,581
(raucous laughter)

2518
01:25:00,581 --> 01:25:01,602
Matt: And just starts laughing, doubles over,

2519
01:25:01,602 --> 01:25:02,837
clutching his stomach,

2520
01:25:02,837 --> 01:25:04,005
laughing his ass off.

2521
01:25:04,005 --> 01:25:06,091
Other dwarves start laughing too.

2522
01:25:06,091 --> 01:25:08,141
The music just gets louder and the band in the back

2523
01:25:08,141 --> 01:25:10,233
of the tavern begins playing again.

2524
01:25:10,233 --> 01:25:13,084
There’s now this general jovial air restored to the tavern.

2525
01:25:13,084 --> 01:25:16,707
Vex: I grab an empty cup off of the table and say,

2526
01:25:16,707 --> 01:25:19,724
“Tips for the bear, right here!”

2527
01:25:19,724 --> 01:25:21,635
Scanlan: (laughs) We’re gonna get money for this?

2528
01:25:21,635 --> 01:25:22,565
Grog: Of course.

2529
01:25:22,565 --> 01:25:23,914
Keyleth: (Imitates a bear)

2530
01:25:23,914 --> 01:25:26,517
Vax: I beeline to the bar and say, “A large mug of ale, please,”

2531
01:25:26,517 --> 01:25:29,841
and as soon as it’s ready, bring it right over to Balgus.

2532
01:25:29,841 --> 01:25:31,717
Laura: Bal… gus.

2533
01:25:31,717 --> 01:25:32,819
Matt: All right, you guys are pulling through a crowd,

2534
01:25:32,819 --> 01:25:34,085
covered in mist still.

2535
01:25:34,085 --> 01:25:35,816
You’re having a hard time finding your way through the bar.

2536
01:25:35,816 --> 01:25:37,168
The people are at least now cheering, in the mood.

2537
01:25:37,168 --> 01:25:38,296
There’s still some people trying to find their way

2538
01:25:38,296 --> 01:25:39,725
to the front to see what’s going because

2539
01:25:39,725 --> 01:25:41,013
they hear the music and they hear the cheering.

2540
01:25:41,013 --> 01:25:42,902
Dwarf patron: Well, what’s going on over there?

2541
01:25:42,902 --> 01:25:43,963
Matt: They’re pushing their way through.

2542
01:25:43,963 --> 01:25:45,400
You make your way to the bar.

2543
01:25:45,400 --> 01:25:46,681
You see Adra’s just like really nervous, like:

2544
01:25:46,681 --> 01:25:48,336
Adra: (panicked sounds)

2545
01:25:48,336 --> 01:25:49,696
Vax: I can fix this! I can fix this.

2546
01:25:49,696 --> 01:25:51,260
Adra: How? Do! Go!

2547
01:25:51,260 --> 01:25:51,643
Vax: Quickly?

2548
01:25:51,643 --> 01:25:53,110
Adra: Here, go!

2549
01:25:53,110 --> 01:25:55,076
Matt: She just hands you one, doesn’t even charge you for it.

2550
01:25:55,076 --> 01:25:55,733
Marisha and Laura: (laughs)

2551
01:25:55,733 --> 01:25:56,783
Keyleth: I’m still dancing! (roars)

2552
01:25:56,783 --> 01:25:57,944
Matt: Still dancing.

2553
01:25:57,944 --> 01:25:59,245
Vax: Looking for Balgus in the crowd.

2554
01:25:59,245 --> 01:26:00,230
Matt: He’s still in the center of the ring.

2555
01:26:00,230 --> 01:26:01,670
No one’s still getting near Balgus,

2556
01:26:01,670 --> 01:26:02,849
he’s just jeering off to the side.

2557
01:26:02,849 --> 01:26:03,915
Vax: I’m gonna smooth this over.

2558
01:26:03,915 --> 01:26:04,978
Matt: All right, so Balgus is laughing.

2559
01:26:04,978 --> 01:26:08,638
Balgus: Ha ha, growl for me! Do a happy growl!

2560
01:26:08,638 --> 01:26:09,102
(pretends to growl)

2561
01:26:09,102 --> 01:26:10,395
Keyleth: (forces a growl)

2562
01:26:10,395 --> 01:26:11,756
Balgus: Yeah, there’s a happy growl!

2563
01:26:11,756 --> 01:26:13,159
(laughter)

2564
01:26:13,159 --> 01:26:14,167
Keyleth: (continues to growl)

2565
01:26:14,167 --> 01:26:17,968
Balgus: Oh, it’s been so long since I’ve been outside!

2566
01:26:17,968 --> 01:26:19,928
(all laugh)

2567
01:26:19,928 --> 01:26:22,594
Matt: A little tear on the edge of his face.

2568
01:26:22,594 --> 01:26:24,179
As you approach up his side -

2569
01:26:24,179 --> 01:26:26,751
Vax: Arm around his shoulder.

2570
01:26:26,751 --> 01:26:27,979
Matt: Immediately, instinctively, he just slaps it off his arm

2571
01:26:27,979 --> 01:26:29,487
and turns around.

2572
01:26:29,487 --> 01:26:30,748
Vax: Take this, take this!

2573
01:26:30,748 --> 01:26:33,240
You are an impressive specimen, my good man.

2574
01:26:33,240 --> 01:26:38,756
I have never had a fight that amazing in at least a week.

2575
01:26:38,756 --> 01:26:40,095
That was something to see.

2576
01:26:40,095 --> 01:26:43,094
Here, take this, and after this one there’s three more.

2577
01:26:43,094 --> 01:26:44,010
Matt: He’s drunk.

2578
01:26:44,010 --> 01:26:45,453
You’re offering him ale.

2579
01:26:45,453 --> 01:26:46,866
And he’s just been laughing at a bear for two minutes.

2580
01:26:46,866 --> 01:26:47,770
Liam: Yes.

2581
01:26:47,770 --> 01:26:48,930
Matt: Make a persuasion roll with advantage.

2582
01:26:48,930 --> 01:26:52,544
Liam: Yeah! Persuasion, you say?

2583
01:26:52,544 --> 01:26:53,441
15.

2584
01:26:53,441 --> 01:26:54,395
Sam: Two rolls! Two rolls.

2585
01:26:54,395 --> 01:26:55,798
Matt: Two rolls, yeah, you have advantage.

2586
01:26:55,798 --> 01:26:56,789
Liam: Oh! 15.

2587
01:26:56,789 --> 01:26:58,379
(all laugh)

2588
01:26:58,379 --> 01:27:00,978
Matt: 15! He looks at you with this big grin,

2589
01:27:00,978 --> 01:27:04,615
and you can now see his gnarled, yellow dwarven teeth.

2590
01:27:04,615 --> 01:27:06,989
This railroad of terror that his mouth is.

2591
01:27:06,989 --> 01:27:08,415
This big smile.

2592
01:27:08,415 --> 01:27:09,485
Travis: (laughs)

2593
01:27:09,485 --> 01:27:12,144
Matt: And he reaches out, his beard just poofing over the side,

2594
01:27:12,144 --> 01:27:13,293
grabs it and goes -

2595
01:27:13,293 --> 01:27:17,910
Balgus: See, now this is dwarven hospitality!

2596
01:27:17,910 --> 01:27:20,435
Matt: And he lifts his drink up and it spills

2597
01:27:20,435 --> 01:27:20,767
a little bit on his arm. And he’s like:

2598
01:27:20,767 --> 01:27:22,537
Balgus: Hey!

2599
01:27:22,537 --> 01:27:23,874
Matt: And everyone lifts up and cheers again.

2600
01:27:23,874 --> 01:27:25,515
All: (hearty cheer)

2601
01:27:25,515 --> 01:27:29,324
Matt: Everyone still keeps drinking through the fog.

2602
01:27:29,324 --> 01:27:32,223
It’s like a bad sauna in here right now.

2603
01:27:32,223 --> 01:27:33,363
Everyone’s just fighting their way through.

2604
01:27:33,363 --> 01:27:37,294
At which point now, Balgus slaps you on the shoulder,

2605
01:27:37,294 --> 01:27:38,455
takes a drink, and wanders out of the fight ring,

2606
01:27:38,455 --> 01:27:40,174
goes and finds a table to sit down

2607
01:27:40,174 --> 01:27:41,935
and begin chugging what you gave him.

2608
01:27:41,935 --> 01:27:44,372
Scanlan: Why don’t we adjourn for the evening?

2609
01:27:44,372 --> 01:27:45,722
Retire to our rooms?

2610
01:27:45,722 --> 01:27:47,286
Grog: Why don’t you go change out of bear form?

2611
01:27:47,286 --> 01:27:48,441
Percy: Oh, God, yes.

2612
01:27:48,441 --> 01:27:49,438
Vex: Change your bear form.

2613
01:27:49,438 --> 01:27:51,169
Keyleth: Yeah, and I guess I can let Trinket

2614
01:27:51,169 --> 01:27:52,491
change out of mouse form.

2615
01:27:52,491 --> 01:27:53,831
Scanlan: Why don’t you wait until we’re upstairs.

2616
01:27:53,831 --> 01:27:55,094
Laura: Can I take the mouse? Can I take the mouse?

2617
01:27:55,094 --> 01:27:55,831
Can I take Trinket?

2618
01:27:55,831 --> 01:27:57,489
Scanlan: Here, rat-mouse-thing.

2619
01:27:57,489 --> 01:27:58,508
Laura: Okay, hi, Trinket!

2620
01:27:58,508 --> 01:28:00,011
Oh, is his armor teeny tiny too?

2621
01:28:00,011 --> 01:28:01,980
Marisha: Oh, does he have a tiny armor mouse? Mouse armor!

2622
01:28:01,980 --> 01:28:07,455
Matt: If you choose, while polymorphing him,

2623
01:28:07,455 --> 01:28:09,746
you could make it as a visual aesthetic.

2624
01:28:09,746 --> 01:28:10,809
But because it was a quick impact,

2625
01:28:10,809 --> 01:28:12,122
I would just say it looks like a normal mouse right now.

2626
01:28:12,122 --> 01:28:13,378
Laura: Oh, wah.

2627
01:28:13,378 --> 01:28:14,470
Matt: Sorry. But next time!

2628
01:28:14,470 --> 01:28:16,059
Marisha: Next time I’ll give him tiny mouse armor.

2629
01:28:16,059 --> 01:28:17,584
Vex: Well you’re still adorable little - don’t poke him.

2630
01:28:17,584 --> 01:28:18,978
Matt: (laughs)

2631
01:28:18,978 --> 01:28:20,339
Trinket: (squeaks)

2632
01:28:20,339 --> 01:28:21,651
Vex: I stick him in my little pocket.

2633
01:28:21,651 --> 01:28:22,865
Matt: All right.

2634
01:28:22,865 --> 01:28:24,830
Vax: I grab a half a mug of ale just off the table and say,

2635
01:28:24,830 --> 01:28:27,682
"Dwarven compatriots, we could not have expected

2636
01:28:27,682 --> 01:28:30,126
a better welcome here in Kraghammer!

2637
01:28:30,126 --> 01:28:32,632
We’ll see you tomorrow night for round two.

2638
01:28:32,632 --> 01:28:33,724
Thank you, one and all."

2639
01:28:33,724 --> 01:28:35,201
Everyone: Huzzah!

2640
01:28:35,201 --> 01:28:36,396
Dwarven patrons: (cheers)

2641
01:28:36,396 --> 01:28:37,591
Matt: Balgus goes -

2642
01:28:37,591 --> 01:28:39,726
Balgus: Three more! You said three more!

2643
01:28:39,726 --> 01:28:40,930
Matt: You see his empty cup on the table.

2644
01:28:40,930 --> 01:28:42,584
Travis: We did say three more.

2645
01:28:42,584 --> 01:28:44,753
Vex: I laugh and hustle her over and say,

2646
01:28:44,753 --> 01:28:45,940
“One two three, put them in a row

2647
01:28:45,940 --> 01:28:47,387
for this gentleman right here.”

2648
01:28:47,387 --> 01:28:49,763
Adra: Aye! (whispers) Ah, thanks.

2649
01:28:49,763 --> 01:28:53,592
Matt: She gives you like a really earnest like, "Thank you."

2650
01:28:53,592 --> 01:28:55,234
You now have a very good idea of how a good third

2651
01:28:55,234 --> 01:28:58,486
of the tables in this tavern are repaired.

2652
01:28:58,486 --> 01:29:00,537
Travis: He’s tough.

2653
01:29:00,537 --> 01:29:02,676
Matt: All right, you guys head back up to the rooms.

2654
01:29:02,676 --> 01:29:03,869
Travis: You put some stank on him.

2655
01:29:03,869 --> 01:29:05,074
Matt: Yeah, that was like a -

2656
01:29:05,074 --> 01:29:06,833
when you got the impact on him.

2657
01:29:06,833 --> 01:29:07,948
Vex: Oh my gosh. Don’t fight him, you guys.

2658
01:29:07,948 --> 01:29:09,196
Scanlan: He’s good.

2659
01:29:09,196 --> 01:29:10,302
Grog: Yeah, leave that to me.

2660
01:29:10,302 --> 01:29:11,472
Vex: Don’t fight him.

2661
01:29:11,472 --> 01:29:12,568
Scanlan: Oh, Grog’s gonna fight him at some point.

2662
01:29:12,568 --> 01:29:13,644
Matt: (laughs) I get the feeling that’s probably

2663
01:29:13,644 --> 01:29:14,850
gonna go down at some point.

2664
01:29:14,850 --> 01:29:15,330
Vex: Yeah, it’s gonna be bad.

2665
01:29:15,330 --> 01:29:16,699
Grog: He’s gonna be playmates with me.

2666
01:29:16,699 --> 01:29:17,916
Vax: It’s just a misunderstanding.

2667
01:29:17,916 --> 01:29:19,186
I’m sure he’s a lovely gentleman.

2668
01:29:19,186 --> 01:29:21,755
Matt: So you guys are heading back up to the room.

2669
01:29:21,755 --> 01:29:23,630
Which, it’s not a hallway built for a bear.

2670
01:29:23,630 --> 01:29:26,071
Your shoulders are squeezing through.

2671
01:29:26,071 --> 01:29:27,221
Laura: How big is the room?

2672
01:29:27,221 --> 01:29:28,557
Matt: Well, each one of your rooms

2673
01:29:28,557 --> 01:29:30,561
comfortably fits two people, maybe.

2674
01:29:30,561 --> 01:29:32,035
Like, one and a half?

2675
01:29:32,035 --> 01:29:33,161
Laura: Oh, no… what will I do with Trinket?

2676
01:29:33,161 --> 01:29:34,613
Matt: So I mean, Trinket...if you help

2677
01:29:34,613 --> 01:29:35,803
push Trinket through the door.

2678
01:29:35,803 --> 01:29:38,662
Trinket - thankfully, dwarves are fairly wide folk,

2679
01:29:38,662 --> 01:29:40,603
so the doors are built for stouter folk,

2680
01:29:40,603 --> 01:29:41,697
they’re just not very tall.

2681
01:29:41,697 --> 01:29:42,494
Laura: Yeah.

2682
01:29:42,494 --> 01:29:43,941
Matt: You, actually, have to bend through, Grog,

2683
01:29:43,941 --> 01:29:44,402
to get into your room.

2684
01:29:44,402 --> 01:29:46,004
Grog: Son of a bitch.

2685
01:29:46,004 --> 01:29:46,989
Matt: And the bed, on the bed that you lie on,

2686
01:29:46,989 --> 01:29:49,530
your legs dangle a good two feet off the bottom, at maximum.

2687
01:29:49,530 --> 01:29:53,501
But you can push Trinket through with a one, two, three!

2688
01:29:53,501 --> 01:29:56,525
Or you can just carry her through as a mouse,

2689
01:29:56,525 --> 01:29:58,171
and then have her stuck in there.

2690
01:29:58,171 --> 01:29:59,372
Marisha: Yeah.

2691
01:29:59,372 --> 01:30:00,782
Vax: That’s all right. Neither of us need a blanket now.

2692
01:30:00,782 --> 01:30:02,173
Laura: Well...

2693
01:30:02,173 --> 01:30:03,509
Marisha: How long can I keep her a mouse?

2694
01:30:03,509 --> 01:30:06,704
Laura: Him! Trinket's a boy, all of you, please.

2695
01:30:06,704 --> 01:30:08,434
Marisha: Him a mouse. Sorry.

2696
01:30:08,434 --> 01:30:09,345
Matt: Up to an hour.

2697
01:30:09,345 --> 01:30:10,422
Marisha: Up to an hour?

2698
01:30:10,422 --> 01:30:11,482
Matt: I believe it is, yeah, concentration.

2699
01:30:11,482 --> 01:30:12,812
Travis: I mean, are there like stables?

2700
01:30:12,812 --> 01:30:14,480
Laura: You know, yeah. Can I go downstairs

2701
01:30:14,480 --> 01:30:16,117
and ask about stables?

2702
01:30:16,117 --> 01:30:17,727
Maybe he can stay in the stables.

2703
01:30:17,727 --> 01:30:19,294
Matt: You have to talk to Adra. She's like:

2704
01:30:19,294 --> 01:30:20,851
Adra: There's no stables in this establishment,

2705
01:30:20,851 --> 01:30:22,476
but we do have a downstairs storage area

2706
01:30:22,476 --> 01:30:24,048
your bear can probably stay in.

2707
01:30:24,048 --> 01:30:26,639
Travis: Yeah, he's a bear, he's fine.

2708
01:30:26,639 --> 01:30:28,536
Vex: Trinket, is that okay?

2709
01:30:28,536 --> 01:30:30,326
Travis: (as Trinket) Yeah, I'm fine.

2710
01:30:30,326 --> 01:30:32,224
Matt: Little mouse (meep, meep, meep)

2711
01:30:32,224 --> 01:30:33,879
Vex: All right, yeah, he's seems to think it's all right.

2712
01:30:33,879 --> 01:30:36,134
Let's go with the storage room.

2713
01:30:36,134 --> 01:30:38,331
Travis, pretending Trinket: (muted roar) I don't give a shit.

2714
01:30:38,331 --> 01:30:40,021
Vex: If there's anything that looks edible, you can eat it.

2715
01:30:40,021 --> 01:30:41,071
It's fine.

2716
01:30:41,071 --> 01:30:42,804
Adra: That's not true.

2717
01:30:42,804 --> 01:30:43,614
Vex: Just kidding!

2718
01:30:43,614 --> 01:30:47,562
Adra: I'll charge you later.

2719
01:30:47,562 --> 01:30:48,684
Matt: So you bring Trinket back down.

2720
01:30:48,684 --> 01:30:50,148
Do you release your polymorph?

2721
01:30:50,148 --> 01:30:51,082
Marisha: Yeah.

2722
01:30:51,082 --> 01:30:53,470
Matt: (transformation noise) Trinket becomes a bear again.

2723
01:30:53,470 --> 01:30:56,570
I'd say the room's probably a good 40 feet by 30 feet.

2724
01:30:56,570 --> 01:30:57,588
Laura: Oh, so he's fine.

2725
01:30:57,588 --> 01:30:59,666
Matt: Half of it's filled with barrels and crates,

2726
01:30:59,666 --> 01:31:01,348
and storage of dried foods.

2727
01:31:01,348 --> 01:31:06,530
Trinket comes in and (sniffs) and starts rummaging

2728
01:31:06,530 --> 01:31:08,614
into one of the half open sacks of dried meat.

2729
01:31:08,614 --> 01:31:11,686
That's going to be put on your bill.

2730
01:31:11,686 --> 01:31:12,906
Laura: Shit.

2731
01:31:12,906 --> 01:31:14,206
Matt: All right, so you head back to your rooms

2732
01:31:14,206 --> 01:31:15,603
for the evening to rest.

2733
01:31:15,603 --> 01:31:17,121
Marisha: Take a nap.

2734
01:31:17,121 --> 01:31:19,736
Matt: Anything you guys want to do in preparation for the next day?

2735
01:31:19,736 --> 01:31:21,072
Sam: No, let's get it on.

2736
01:31:21,072 --> 01:31:23,898
Keyleth: Oh, we should give our comment cards to Balgus.

2737
01:31:23,898 --> 01:31:25,131
Percy: I think we should all turn in our comment cards.

2738
01:31:25,131 --> 01:31:26,766
Vex: Oh, our comments cards, that's right.

2739
01:31:26,766 --> 01:31:31,143
Matt: You turn in your comment cards for Balan.

2740
01:31:31,143 --> 01:31:32,148
Marisha: Balan.

2741
01:31:32,148 --> 01:31:34,565
Percy: I can't stress how important this is.

2742
01:31:34,565 --> 01:31:35,681
Vax: Maybe we should... go ahead, I'm sorry.

2743
01:31:35,681 --> 01:31:39,238
Percy: No, no, really, no it's fine, speak over me, I don’t care.

2744
01:31:39,238 --> 01:31:40,387
Keyleth: Here, take him the extras.

2745
01:31:40,387 --> 01:31:42,028
Percy: We're going to give him a few extras

2746
01:31:42,028 --> 01:31:44,100
so he can have more comments.

2747
01:31:44,100 --> 01:31:45,147
Keyleth: Yes.

2748
01:31:45,147 --> 01:31:47,138
Scanlan: You guys are so kind with these comment cards.

2749
01:31:47,138 --> 01:31:50,098
Liam: Perhaps we should all go to bed,

2750
01:31:50,098 --> 01:31:51,302
and the humans back in North Hollywood

2751
01:31:51,302 --> 01:31:54,881
should take a pee break. At some point.

2752
01:31:54,881 --> 01:31:55,909
Sam: The humans?

2753
01:31:55,909 --> 01:31:58,144
Liam: You. And you, and you and you and you and me.

2754
01:31:58,144 --> 01:31:59,422
Matt: Yes, indeed. Do you want to take a quick

2755
01:31:59,422 --> 01:32:02,505
restroom break for the folks here?

2756
01:32:02,505 --> 01:32:03,343
Sam: You okay?

2757
01:32:03,343 --> 01:32:04,424
Matt: Zac?

2758
01:32:04,424 --> 01:32:06,880
Zac: (off screen) What's that?

2759
01:32:06,880 --> 01:32:08,595
Matt: Folks here might want to use the restroom real fast.

2760
01:32:08,595 --> 01:32:10,464
Zac: (off screen) You want me to play the intro videos again?

2761
01:32:10,464 --> 01:32:12,774
Matt: You know what, go ahead and play some of the intro videos

2762
01:32:12,774 --> 01:32:15,235
and we'll come back here in a minute to continue the game,

2763
01:32:15,235 --> 01:32:18,886
while everyone rests, and empties their bladders.

2764
01:32:18,886 --> 01:32:20,547
We'll be right back guys. Hang tight.

2765
01:32:20,547 --> 01:32:22,937
Sam: Commercial break.

2766
01:32:22,937 --> 01:32:25,789
Grog: Right, Listen up! If you have ale,

2767
01:32:25,789 --> 01:32:29,896
then you have a friend in Grog Strongjaw!

2768
01:32:29,896 --> 01:32:33,884
A goliath of towering height and size,

2769
01:32:33,884 --> 01:32:36,298
this barbarian has an appetite for the two great

2770
01:32:36,298 --> 01:32:43,260
loves in his life: combat, women, and ale! (chuckle)

2771
01:32:43,260 --> 01:32:44,175
(record scratch)

2772
01:32:44,175 --> 01:32:45,447
Wait.

2773
01:32:45,447 --> 01:32:47,103
Easily the brains of the group,

2774
01:32:47,103 --> 01:32:50,227
Grog is often consulted for his vast knowledge

2775
01:32:50,227 --> 01:32:54,426
of shapes, colors, and (chuckle) shiny things!

2776
01:32:54,426 --> 01:32:56,449
...also ale.

2777
01:32:56,449 --> 01:33:00,405
In his early years, armed with his two handed great axe,

2778
01:33:00,405 --> 01:33:03,432
Grog often enjoyed proving his might amongst the ranks

2779
01:33:03,432 --> 01:33:05,698
of his family's wandering herd.

2780
01:33:05,698 --> 01:33:10,130
But after coming upon an unsuspecting elderly gnome in the woods,

2781
01:33:10,130 --> 01:33:14,532
he objected to the killing such an innocent life.

2782
01:33:14,532 --> 01:33:19,306
A creature of impulse, Grog felt only pity for this...

2783
01:33:19,306 --> 01:33:22,929
well this terrified little thing.

2784
01:33:22,929 --> 01:33:25,567
And his disobedience cost him dearly.

2785
01:33:25,567 --> 01:33:26,640
(weapon crack)

2786
01:33:26,640 --> 01:33:29,419
Beaten bloody, and banished by the herd leader,

2787
01:33:29,419 --> 01:33:30,804
his uncle Kevdak,

2788
01:33:30,804 --> 01:33:34,746
Grog was abandoned and left to die.

2789
01:33:34,746 --> 01:33:37,836
Exiled from his herd, it was then that

2790
01:33:37,836 --> 01:33:40,961
the relative of the very gnome he fought to save,

2791
01:33:40,961 --> 01:33:43,502
saved him.

2792
01:33:43,502 --> 01:33:46,912
It was the kindness of a gnome cleric named Pike,

2793
01:33:46,912 --> 01:33:49,130
that healed Grog, bringing him back from death's edge.

2794
01:33:49,130 --> 01:33:54,083
And they have remained close friends ever since.

2795
01:33:54,083 --> 01:33:55,416
(brawling sounds)

2796
01:33:55,416 --> 01:33:57,913
Most nights, Grog can be found challenging

2797
01:33:57,913 --> 01:34:00,981
entire taverns to wrestling matches! Ha!

2798
01:34:00,981 --> 01:34:03,663
...or accompanying Scanlan to the nearest house,

2799
01:34:03,663 --> 01:34:05,784
where you pay for...

2800
01:34:05,784 --> 01:34:07,890
lady favors.

2801
01:34:07,890 --> 01:34:09,060
Also ale!

2802
01:34:10,667 --> 01:34:12,555
Keyleth: A first Impression of Keyleth would

2803
01:34:12,555 --> 01:34:13,627
leave you with little information

2804
01:34:13,627 --> 01:34:15,789
on the half-elven druid.

2805
01:34:15,789 --> 01:34:18,138
You might even think that her social awkwardness

2806
01:34:18,138 --> 01:34:20,385
due to her sheltered upbringing is kinda sweet.

2807
01:34:20,385 --> 01:34:21,535
(chuckle)

2808
01:34:21,535 --> 01:34:24,731
Of course, it would be unwise underestimate her

2809
01:34:24,731 --> 01:34:25,898
based on first impressions.

2810
01:34:25,898 --> 01:34:28,188
(thunder crack)

2811
01:34:28,188 --> 01:34:30,387
Under that unintimidating petite frame is a

2812
01:34:30,387 --> 01:34:32,766
vicious beast waiting to be unleashed,

2813
01:34:32,766 --> 01:34:35,269
whose natural powers have made even the fiercest of

2814
01:34:35,269 --> 01:34:38,111
champions pee their pants, literally!

2815
01:34:38,111 --> 01:34:39,061
(soft chuckle)

2816
01:34:39,061 --> 01:34:42,227
Born to the Air Tribe of the Ashari people,

2817
01:34:42,227 --> 01:34:44,163
Keyleth was raised with a deep love

2818
01:34:44,163 --> 01:34:46,965
of nature and the elemental magics.

2819
01:34:46,965 --> 01:34:49,113
It is her people’s inherent duty to protect the

2820
01:34:49,113 --> 01:34:51,358
delicate areas in Tal'Dorei

2821
01:34:51,358 --> 01:34:55,615
where the four elemental planes begin to bleed with this realm.

2822
01:34:55,615 --> 01:34:57,956
Since she was a little girl, she had quite a knack

2823
01:34:57,956 --> 01:35:01,303
for air manipulation and beast shaping abilities.

2824
01:35:01,303 --> 01:35:03,461
Well, if you consider Kittens and

2825
01:35:03,461 --> 01:35:06,029
flying squirrels to be little beasts.

2826
01:35:06,029 --> 01:35:07,299
Which, I do.

2827
01:35:08,615 --> 01:35:09,812
(clears throat)

2828
01:35:09,812 --> 01:35:12,297
Anyways, it wasn't long before the headmaster of the tribe,

2829
01:35:12,297 --> 01:35:13,624
her father, Kohren,

2830
01:35:13,624 --> 01:35:16,011
realized her true prodigious abilities and

2831
01:35:16,011 --> 01:35:19,530
she was inveterated to succeed him as the next headmaster.

2832
01:35:19,530 --> 01:35:22,981
Just like that, her jovial childhood was stripped and

2833
01:35:22,981 --> 01:35:25,707
replaced with endless spell memorization,

2834
01:35:25,707 --> 01:35:27,580
teachings from ancient traditions,

2835
01:35:27,580 --> 01:35:30,000
and exceedingly high expectations.

2836
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:32,291
Every druid leader to be must embark on journey

2837
01:35:32,291 --> 01:35:34,544
to seek out the sister tribes

2838
01:35:34,544 --> 01:35:36,989
in order to introduce and establish respect

2839
01:35:36,989 --> 01:35:38,569
amongst the fellow headmasters.

2840
01:35:39,397 --> 01:35:41,502
They call this the Aramente, or Noble Odyssey.

2841
01:35:41,502 --> 01:35:45,864
When her father felt she was ready, he set her on the path

2842
01:35:45,864 --> 01:35:48,113
to truly discovering herself.

2843
01:35:48,113 --> 01:35:51,373
Not knowing when, or if she will ever return.

2844
01:35:51,373 --> 01:35:54,040
As she hiked down the mountain towards Stillben,

2845
01:35:54,040 --> 01:35:56,855
she meditated on the task ahead.

2846
01:35:56,855 --> 01:35:59,142
Part of the Aramente is proving yourself

2847
01:35:59,142 --> 01:36:01,937
a strong warrior, a valiant protector,

2848
01:36:01,937 --> 01:36:04,987
and a wise and compassionate leader.

2849
01:36:04,987 --> 01:36:07,359
With this knowledge, one thought plays

2850
01:36:07,359 --> 01:36:09,710
in repeat in her mind:

2851
01:36:09,710 --> 01:36:11,944
Is she even worthy?

2852
01:36:14,463 --> 01:36:16,887
Percy: Percy was the third child of 7 children,

2853
01:36:16,887 --> 01:36:18,789
born to a noble family who lived far to the

2854
01:36:18,789 --> 01:36:21,858
north in the ancient castle of Whitestone.

2855
01:36:21,858 --> 01:36:23,923
With so many siblings to share the burdens of

2856
01:36:23,923 --> 01:36:26,159
lordship, Percy turned his attention to the

2857
01:36:26,159 --> 01:36:29,608
sciences, engineering, and naturalism.

2858
01:36:29,608 --> 01:36:32,581
One day, a mysterious couple,

2859
01:36:32,581 --> 01:36:35,156
named Lord and Lady Briarwood, came to court.

2860
01:36:35,156 --> 01:36:37,212
During a feast held in their honour,

2861
01:36:37,212 --> 01:36:40,003
the Briarwoods violently took control of the castle,

2862
01:36:40,003 --> 01:36:43,781
killing or imprisoning everyone who would stand in their way.

2863
01:36:43,781 --> 01:36:46,295
Percy awoke chained in the dungeon,

2864
01:36:46,295 --> 01:36:48,889
only to be freed by his younger sister.

2865
01:36:48,889 --> 01:36:52,504
Together they fled, chased by the Briarwoods’ men.

2866
01:36:52,504 --> 01:36:54,437
As they ran, Percy’s sister took

2867
01:36:54,437 --> 01:36:57,641
several arrows to the chest and fell.

2868
01:36:57,641 --> 01:36:59,685
Percy kept running, eventually jumping into

2869
01:36:59,685 --> 01:37:03,438
a freezing river and floating unconscious to freedom.

2870
01:37:03,438 --> 01:37:06,462
He did not remember waking up on a fishing boat.

2871
01:37:06,462 --> 01:37:08,587
He barely remembered the next two years, as he

2872
01:37:08,587 --> 01:37:11,906
slowly made his way as far south as possible.

2873
01:37:11,906 --> 01:37:15,276
Then one night, Percy had a dream.

2874
01:37:15,276 --> 01:37:17,962
A roaring cloud of smoke offered him

2875
01:37:17,962 --> 01:37:20,801
vengeance against those who destroyed his family.

2876
01:37:20,801 --> 01:37:26,162
When he awoke, Percy began to design his first gun.

2877
01:37:28,284 --> 01:37:31,199
Scanlan: Oh, you haven’t heard of Scanlan Shorthalt?

2878
01:37:31,199 --> 01:37:33,045
Well, gird your loins, ladies,

2879
01:37:33,045 --> 01:37:35,242
because he has his eye on you.

2880
01:37:35,242 --> 01:37:37,995
A talented musician, master of disguise, and dashingly

2881
01:37:37,995 --> 01:37:40,709
handsome in his own mind, Scanlan sings songs

2882
01:37:40,709 --> 01:37:44,794
almost as much as he sings his own praises.

2883
01:37:44,794 --> 01:37:47,711
Born a poor Gnome, Scanlan used his endless

2884
01:37:47,711 --> 01:37:49,029
charm and soaring tenor voice to

2885
01:37:49,029 --> 01:37:51,925
croon for coin and support his single mother.

2886
01:37:51,925 --> 01:37:54,874
One day he was discovered by a half-orc promoter,

2887
01:37:54,874 --> 01:37:58,728
and joined Dr. Dranzel’s Spectacular Traveling Troupe

2888
01:37:58,728 --> 01:38:00,495
where he learned the ways of the world,

2889
01:38:00,495 --> 01:38:04,984
and honed his skills as a bard extraordinaire.

2890
01:38:04,984 --> 01:38:07,226
A loner much of his life, Scanlan has never quite

2891
01:38:07,226 --> 01:38:09,018
come to terms with the violent

2892
01:38:09,018 --> 01:38:11,794
death of his mother at the hands of a Goblin invasion.

2893
01:38:11,794 --> 01:38:15,529
While his years on the road provided many, shall we say,

2894
01:38:15,529 --> 01:38:18,941
educational experiences with the opposite sex,

2895
01:38:18,941 --> 01:38:21,067
deep down Scanlan yearns for the one thing

2896
01:38:21,067 --> 01:38:23,495
he’s never known: the true love

2897
01:38:23,495 --> 01:38:26,157
of a fellow Gnome.

2898
01:38:26,157 --> 01:38:28,925
Still, Scanlan considers himself a lover first,

2899
01:38:28,925 --> 01:38:32,601
performer second, and fighter distant third.

2900
01:38:32,601 --> 01:38:34,397
On the battlefield, he’ll support his allies,

2901
01:38:34,397 --> 01:38:37,848
but rarely draws blood unless it’s to protect

2902
01:38:37,848 --> 01:38:41,624
fellow Gnome, Pike. Count on Scanlan for a hearty laugh,

2903
01:38:41,624 --> 01:38:45,377
a rollicking song, and a twinkle in his eye that melts hearts

2904
01:38:45,377 --> 01:38:48,318
and makes the females swoon.

2905
01:38:49,668 --> 01:38:52,746
Tiberius: Greetings and salutations.

2906
01:38:52,746 --> 01:38:55,068
I am Tiberius Stormwind.

2907
01:38:55,068 --> 01:38:57,061
I hail from a town called Ty'rex,

2908
01:38:57,061 --> 01:38:59,319
located in the heart of Draconia,

2909
01:38:59,319 --> 01:39:01,742
born from a politically respected family.

2910
01:39:01,742 --> 01:39:05,160
At the age of 15, I succeeded in passing the Sorcerer’s Rite,

2911
01:39:05,160 --> 01:39:07,763
showing prodigy-like control of my magic.

2912
01:39:07,763 --> 01:39:10,352
The judges and the Draconian high council were amazed at

2913
01:39:10,352 --> 01:39:13,680
how powerful my spells were for how long I had been training.

2914
01:39:13,680 --> 01:39:15,973
At 20 years old, I was the youngest appointed member

2915
01:39:15,973 --> 01:39:18,989
of the magic guild in Draconian history. For the

2916
01:39:18,989 --> 01:39:20,813
next few years, I almost went mad from the

2917
01:39:20,813 --> 01:39:22,979
malaise of being a guild member,

2918
01:39:22,979 --> 01:39:25,096
as it’s rather boring.

2919
01:39:25,096 --> 01:39:27,547
However, one day I happened upon a chamber,

2920
01:39:27,547 --> 01:39:29,083
unused for quite some time.

2921
01:39:29,083 --> 01:39:31,704
In the room were stacks of books and maps

2922
01:39:31,704 --> 01:39:33,579
of the surrounding cities and areas

2923
01:39:33,579 --> 01:39:35,233
around the known world.

2924
01:39:35,233 --> 01:39:37,720
For months I would frequent the chamber, and learned

2925
01:39:37,720 --> 01:39:39,677
of artifacts from legend.

2926
01:39:39,677 --> 01:39:42,366
After a long period of research, I made a list of artifacts

2927
01:39:42,366 --> 01:39:43,992
that caught my eye.

2928
01:39:43,992 --> 01:39:46,379
I brought these findings to the high council and was told that

2929
01:39:46,379 --> 01:39:48,871
all of the information in the chamber I had stumbled upon

2930
01:39:48,871 --> 01:39:52,531
was either believed to be fiction, or unsolvable mysteries,

2931
01:39:52,531 --> 01:39:55,184
and hence were lost forever.

2932
01:39:55,184 --> 01:39:58,016
I found those answers to be unacceptable.

2933
01:39:58,016 --> 01:40:00,278
A year later I devised a ruse and managed to

2934
01:40:00,278 --> 01:40:01,961
convince the city council to lend support

2935
01:40:01,961 --> 01:40:04,387
in me leaving Draconia on a mission of peace

2936
01:40:04,387 --> 01:40:06,921
and diplomacy for the surrounding kingdoms.

2937
01:40:06,921 --> 01:40:09,401
Going from town to town and making friends and allies,

2938
01:40:09,401 --> 01:40:11,426
in and for the name of Draconia.

2939
01:40:11,426 --> 01:40:13,004
Being a red dragonborn,

2940
01:40:13,004 --> 01:40:16,065
I had quite the task on my hands in that respect,

2941
01:40:16,065 --> 01:40:18,384
but it was exactly what I needed so I could explore

2942
01:40:18,384 --> 01:40:20,582
the world and find these artifacts,

2943
01:40:20,582 --> 01:40:23,211
as I felt the truth was out there.

2944
01:40:23,211 --> 01:40:25,363
Some may describe me as buffoonish,

2945
01:40:25,363 --> 01:40:28,234
but I say poppycock to all that.

2946
01:40:28,234 --> 01:40:30,362
I am much sharper than most give me credit for.

2947
01:40:30,362 --> 01:40:33,582
I just don’t pay attention to things sometimes.

2948
01:40:33,582 --> 01:40:36,646
I’ve also been known to be rather cunning, loyal,

2949
01:40:36,646 --> 01:40:40,698
happy-go-lucky, and well, dangerous.

2950
01:40:40,698 --> 01:40:43,579
I can’t help but show my true scales every now and then.

2951
01:40:43,579 --> 01:40:47,021
But overall, I think I’m quite friendly for a Dragonborn.

2952
01:40:48,952 --> 01:40:50,449
Vax: Never entirely welcome in the company of

2953
01:40:50,449 --> 01:40:52,670
elves or men, Vax'ildan learned

2954
01:40:52,670 --> 01:40:55,221
at a young age to skip past formality,

2955
01:40:55,221 --> 01:40:58,604
preferring instead to invite himself in your door.

2956
01:40:58,604 --> 01:41:01,008
Along with twin sister Vex'ahlia,

2957
01:41:01,008 --> 01:41:03,800
Vax was born by a chance encounter between Elven

2958
01:41:03,800 --> 01:41:06,363
royalty and Human peasantry.

2959
01:41:06,363 --> 01:41:09,318
Raised by their mother in their early years, the twins

2960
01:41:09,318 --> 01:41:11,276
were eventually sent off to their father

2961
01:41:11,276 --> 01:41:13,220
in the Elven capital of Singorn.

2962
01:41:13,220 --> 01:41:16,703
But their cool reception among the Elves there never warmed,

2963
01:41:16,703 --> 01:41:19,746
and their time in the capital didn’t last.

2964
01:41:19,746 --> 01:41:22,536
The siblings stole away one autumn night and set out on

2965
01:41:22,536 --> 01:41:24,280
the open road.

2966
01:41:24,280 --> 01:41:27,176
After a few years of wandering, they eventually decided to

2967
01:41:27,176 --> 01:41:29,473
return to their mother, and journeyed

2968
01:41:29,473 --> 01:41:31,887
back to the lands of their youth.

2969
01:41:31,887 --> 01:41:34,121
But instead of finding their childhood home,

2970
01:41:34,121 --> 01:41:37,430
they returned to a pile of rubble.

2971
01:41:37,430 --> 01:41:40,394
Their mother was gone, their home burned to ash.

2972
01:41:40,394 --> 01:41:43,251
Pressing the townspeople for answers,

2973
01:41:43,251 --> 01:41:45,902
they learned of the day the dragon came.

2974
01:41:47,032 --> 01:41:51,129
With their ties all severed, Vax'ildan and his sister

2975
01:41:52,780 --> 01:41:56,209
set out to find their fortune together in Tal'Dorei.

2976
01:41:56,209 --> 01:42:00,682
An outsider since birth, Vax quickly learned to solve life’s

2977
01:42:00,682 --> 01:42:03,799
challenges in his own particular way,

2978
01:42:03,799 --> 01:42:06,672
often by sidestepping them entirely.

2979
01:42:06,672 --> 01:42:10,303
And when his knack for circumventing adversity isn’t enough,

2980
01:42:10,303 --> 01:42:13,850
the way of blades the elves schooled him in

2981
01:42:13,850 --> 01:42:16,072
more than makes up the difference.

2982
01:42:17,540 --> 01:42:19,548
Vex: Like so many Half-Elves,

2983
01:42:19,548 --> 01:42:22,203
Vex'ahlia has spent most of her life suffering

2984
01:42:22,203 --> 01:42:26,506
the cool reception of a people who don’t fully accept her.

2985
01:42:26,506 --> 01:42:30,880
Born of a Human mother, and an elven father who only later in life

2986
01:42:30,880 --> 01:42:33,277
took an interest in their existence,

2987
01:42:33,277 --> 01:42:36,601
Vex'ahlia and her twin brother Vax'ildan quickly

2988
01:42:36,601 --> 01:42:39,850
realized the only people they could truly rely on

2989
01:42:39,850 --> 01:42:43,045
in this world were each other.

2990
01:42:43,045 --> 01:42:46,401
It was at the age of 10 when the two were taken from their mother,

2991
01:42:46,401 --> 01:42:48,494
and brought to live in Singorn,

2992
01:42:48,494 --> 01:42:52,325
the isolated Elven city for which their father was an ambassador.

2993
01:42:52,325 --> 01:42:56,753
He quietly took them in, but always kept an icy distance,

2994
01:42:56,753 --> 01:42:59,791
and after too many years of disdainful looks,

2995
01:42:59,791 --> 01:43:02,944
the pair decided to leave his indifference behind,

2996
01:43:02,944 --> 01:43:05,566
and set out on their own.

2997
01:43:05,566 --> 01:43:09,168
Vax took to the cities, stealing small trinkets and

2998
01:43:09,168 --> 01:43:11,719
learning the ways of the thief,

2999
01:43:11,719 --> 01:43:14,558
while Vex kept to the woods.

3000
01:43:14,558 --> 01:43:16,868
She preferred the isolation.

3001
01:43:16,868 --> 01:43:21,207
Always the keen observer, she learned to hunt and to track,

3002
01:43:21,207 --> 01:43:23,315
to spy and to shoot.

3003
01:43:23,315 --> 01:43:25,933
And through a series of fateful events,

3004
01:43:25,933 --> 01:43:29,359
earned herself a companion in the form of a bear -

3005
01:43:29,359 --> 01:43:32,141
her own stolen Trinket -

3006
01:43:32,141 --> 01:43:35,746
to fight alongside her and protect her fiercely.

3007
01:43:35,746 --> 01:43:40,545
Also he is adorable, and gives expert massages.

3008
01:43:41,742 --> 01:43:43,032
Matt: Hello, everyone. Welcome back.

3009
01:43:43,032 --> 01:43:44,226
We've had our pee breaks.

3010
01:43:44,226 --> 01:43:46,746
We've had our refills of our drinks.

3011
01:43:46,746 --> 01:43:50,334
We’ve got Fireball, so I think we're good for the next venture.

3012
01:43:50,334 --> 01:43:53,190
So anyway, the party has taken their rest for the evening.

3013
01:43:53,190 --> 01:43:55,497
Once again, this is one of those weird experiences

3014
01:43:55,497 --> 01:43:57,772
where you wake up, not because of the sun rising,

3015
01:43:57,772 --> 01:44:00,743
because you can't see it in the dwarven city of Kraghammer,

3016
01:44:00,743 --> 01:44:04,605
but eventually you all come to consciousness naturally.

3017
01:44:04,605 --> 01:44:06,862
What is your plan of action?

3018
01:44:06,862 --> 01:44:07,984
Sam: Oh, Jesus, we should have all talked about this

3019
01:44:07,984 --> 01:44:09,281
while we were all peeing.

3020
01:44:09,281 --> 01:44:10,283
(all laugh)

3021
01:44:10,283 --> 01:44:11,948
Grog: We’re gonna beat up everybody, right?

3022
01:44:11,948 --> 01:44:13,628
Scanlan: Are we going to the manor?

3023
01:44:13,628 --> 01:44:14,936
Percy: I say we have brunch, and we go to the manor -

3024
01:44:14,936 --> 01:44:16,025
Laura: (laugh) Brunch.

3025
01:44:16,025 --> 01:44:16,525
Travis: (laugh) Brunch?

3026
01:44:16,525 --> 01:44:18,343
Percy: I want to have brunch with everyone.

3027
01:44:18,343 --> 01:44:18,808
Scanlan: Eggs benedict.

3028
01:44:18,808 --> 01:44:20,679
Percy: I want dwarven brunch.

3029
01:44:20,679 --> 01:44:21,921
Vax: I want a traditional dwarven breakfast.

3030
01:44:21,921 --> 01:44:23,817
Keyleth: It's very good.

3031
01:44:23,817 --> 01:44:24,773
Dwarven eggs are very good.

3032
01:44:24,773 --> 01:44:27,154
Percy: They're small.

3033
01:44:27,154 --> 01:44:28,866
Orion: I tell them of my experience.

3034
01:44:28,866 --> 01:44:30,869
Matt: Okay, so Tiberius fills you all in about his experience,

3035
01:44:30,869 --> 01:44:32,413
trying to get into the house Thunderbrand.

3036
01:44:32,413 --> 01:44:33,890
Grog: How you almost got killed?

3037
01:44:33,890 --> 01:44:35,307
Tiberius: I didn't, certainly not.

3038
01:44:35,307 --> 01:44:37,646
I just couldn't get in the door. Rather rude!

3039
01:44:37,646 --> 01:44:41,703
Keyleth: Why did you think that after the magic hand failed that the

3040
01:44:41,703 --> 01:44:44,148
big thunder ice wave would work?

3041
01:44:44,148 --> 01:44:46,001
Tiberius: What I thought is that I could cover the rune with ice and

3042
01:44:46,001 --> 01:44:51,325
merely step over it. I didn't think it would dissolve my ice.

3043
01:44:51,325 --> 01:44:54,648
Percy: In his defense, there's only one way to find out.

3044
01:44:54,648 --> 01:44:55,694
Keyleth: That's true.

3045
01:44:55,694 --> 01:44:55,961
Grog: Did you sleep?

3046
01:44:55,961 --> 01:44:57,779
Tiberius: Yes.

3047
01:44:57,779 --> 01:44:58,974
Grog: Oh. I had to make sure, you know.

3048
01:44:58,974 --> 01:45:00,457
Tiberius: A good sorcerer always all his tricks before,

3049
01:45:00,457 --> 01:45:02,451
you know, turning around, which is what I did.

3050
01:45:02,451 --> 01:45:03,750
Tiberius: And I think we should go back there because I feel

3051
01:45:03,750 --> 01:45:05,801
that it's significant that I couldn't get in so easily.

3052
01:45:05,801 --> 01:45:07,360
Percy: We will, we will go back there.

3053
01:45:07,360 --> 01:45:09,849
I don't think it's the next order of business but I think that there is -

3054
01:45:09,849 --> 01:45:12,000
we're not leaving the city without dealing with that.

3055
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:13,331
Laura: Definitely.

3056
01:45:13,331 --> 01:45:14,792
Grog: Do we need to do something with the comment cards?

3057
01:45:14,792 --> 01:45:15,461
Vex: Oh...

3058
01:45:15,461 --> 01:45:16,244
Scanlan: (Laughs.) Please no.

3059
01:45:16,244 --> 01:45:18,211
Percy: Did you not fill out your comment card?

3060
01:45:18,211 --> 01:45:19,844
Grog: No, I did! But I know, like, three letters, so...

3061
01:45:19,844 --> 01:45:21,964
Tiberius: I'm sure that's fine.

3062
01:45:21,964 --> 01:45:24,049
Grog: ...Like, A, F, and A.

3063
01:45:24,049 --> 01:45:25,266
Marisha: That's okay.

3064
01:45:25,266 --> 01:45:26,388
Percy: That sounds very positive.

3065
01:45:26,388 --> 01:45:26,754
Vex: Yes, I agree.

3066
01:45:26,754 --> 01:45:28,615
Keyleth: It's the thought that counts, Grog.

3067
01:45:28,615 --> 01:45:29,807
It's the thought that counts.

3068
01:45:29,807 --> 01:45:31,231
Grog: I'm learning.

3069
01:45:31,231 --> 01:45:32,565
Vex: Did you put, like, a smiley face next to the A-F-A?

3070
01:45:32,565 --> 01:45:34,697
Travis: I covered my hand in ink and, yeah.

3071
01:45:34,697 --> 01:45:35,631
Vex: That works.

3072
01:45:35,631 --> 01:45:37,804
Percy: Very good. I think that went well.

3073
01:45:37,804 --> 01:45:41,415
Scanlan: Shall we try to make our way to the manor, then?

3074
01:45:41,415 --> 01:45:43,987
Vex: The Greyspine Manor, with our cask of fancy ale.

3075
01:45:43,987 --> 01:45:45,680
Slash wine.

3076
01:45:45,680 --> 01:45:46,635
Travis: Does the light ever change?

3077
01:45:46,635 --> 01:45:48,084
Does the light ever change being underground?

3078
01:45:48,084 --> 01:45:50,934
Matt: No, it is a perpetual low red glow

3079
01:45:50,934 --> 01:45:53,004
from all the stones that are embedded around the streets.

3080
01:45:53,004 --> 01:45:56,149
Vex: All right, I feel really sleepy and also

3081
01:45:56,149 --> 01:45:57,947
very awake at the same time.

3082
01:45:57,947 --> 01:45:59,103
Keyleth: Yeah, I know.

3083
01:45:59,103 --> 01:46:00,079
Matt: Oh, dwarves.

3084
01:46:00,079 --> 01:46:01,499
Matt: All right.

3085
01:46:01,499 --> 01:46:01,999
Laura: So what do you think?

3086
01:46:01,999 --> 01:46:03,720
Travis: Should we go to the house?

3087
01:46:03,720 --> 01:46:03,970
Taliesin: Now I'm curious if there's dwarven coffee.

3088
01:46:03,970 --> 01:46:05,958
Sam: Let's go, let's do it.

3089
01:46:05,958 --> 01:46:07,496
Matt: You guys make your way after your brunch,

3090
01:46:07,496 --> 01:46:07,746
your delicious dwarven brunch -

3091
01:46:07,746 --> 01:46:10,556
Taliesin: Thank you!

3092
01:46:10,556 --> 01:46:11,769
Matt: - which is very alcoholic.

3093
01:46:11,769 --> 01:46:13,202
Travis: Yes!

3094
01:46:13,202 --> 01:46:14,489
Taliesin: It's like being in New Orleans for the weekend,

3095
01:46:14,489 --> 01:46:16,136
every meal is gonna come with something alcoholic.

3096
01:46:16,136 --> 01:46:18,571
Orion: On the way there, I'm gonna cast alter self and turn into a dwarf.

3097
01:46:18,571 --> 01:46:19,760
Matt: All right.

3098
01:46:19,760 --> 01:46:20,260
Laura: You're turning yourself into a dwarf?

3099
01:46:20,260 --> 01:46:22,060
Sam: Did you catch that? He just turned himself into a dwarf.

3100
01:46:22,060 --> 01:46:23,415
Travis: You did?

3101
01:46:23,415 --> 01:46:24,838
Matt: Tiberius went (swoosh) into a dwarven form.

3102
01:46:24,838 --> 01:46:26,347
Laura: What kind of dwarf? What do you look like?

3103
01:46:26,347 --> 01:46:27,314
Travis: Are you a girl?

3104
01:46:27,314 --> 01:46:28,380
Sam: He is very handsome for a dwarf.

3105
01:46:28,380 --> 01:46:29,706
Laura: Are you a girl dwarf?

3106
01:46:29,706 --> 01:46:30,835
Marisha: Yes! You should be a lady dwarf.

3107
01:46:30,835 --> 01:46:32,024
Sam: Oh yeah, what kind of dwarf? A lady dwarf?

3108
01:46:32,024 --> 01:46:32,408
Taliesin: Dwarfette?

3109
01:46:32,408 --> 01:46:33,927
Tiberius: I would not do that again.

3110
01:46:33,927 --> 01:46:34,507
Laura: (Laughs.)

3111
01:46:34,507 --> 01:46:35,986
Travis: Oh, you did do that, you did take it as a troll.

3112
01:46:35,986 --> 01:46:36,761
(all laugh)

3113
01:46:36,761 --> 01:46:39,144
Tiberius: Almost! She shot off the penis.

3114
01:46:39,144 --> 01:46:40,470
Vax: What is going on?

3115
01:46:40,470 --> 01:46:42,029
Travis: That's where the troll dick came from.

3116
01:46:42,029 --> 01:46:44,237
Tiberius: Don't you remember Vax? I was almost raped by trolls.

3117
01:46:44,237 --> 01:46:46,148
Matt: A little backstory: there was a cavern interaction

3118
01:46:46,148 --> 01:46:48,302
with two male trolls that they had stealthed up behind as a party.

3119
01:46:48,302 --> 01:46:50,682
I love explaining this to the audience.

3120
01:46:50,682 --> 01:46:53,351
Tiberius then polymorphed into a female troll to try

3121
01:46:53,351 --> 01:46:57,059
and Bugs Bunny them, not realizing that dwarves who are

3122
01:46:57,059 --> 01:46:59,201
underground and don't have female trolls -

3123
01:46:59,201 --> 01:47:04,312
encounter female trolls often enough to have a one track mind.

3124
01:47:04,312 --> 01:47:06,499
And so he nearly got himself in a very bad situation.

3125
01:47:06,499 --> 01:47:08,817
That was remedied by the party attacking and -

3126
01:47:08,817 --> 01:47:12,783
Vex over here shooting off the troll's dick.

3127
01:47:12,783 --> 01:47:15,319
Which then, went in the bag of holding, which is disgusting.

3128
01:47:15,319 --> 01:47:15,894
Laura: Yes!

3129
01:47:15,894 --> 01:47:16,641
Travis: Yes, for a long time.

3130
01:47:16,641 --> 01:47:18,318
Marisha: That's also where the hashtag not all trolls came from.

3131
01:47:18,318 --> 01:47:19,825
Matt: Yup, hashtag not all trolls came from that game.

3132
01:47:19,825 --> 01:47:20,930
Orion, Liam: Not all trolls.

3133
01:47:20,930 --> 01:47:22,249
Matt: That is horrible.

3134
01:47:22,249 --> 01:47:23,630
Taliesin: Oh god. A-a-a-and bring it back.

3135
01:47:23,630 --> 01:47:25,042
Matt: Anyway, so...

3136
01:47:25,042 --> 01:47:26,290
Marisha: Bringing it back.

3137
01:47:26,290 --> 01:47:28,645
Matt: You guys make your way to the residential district.

3138
01:47:28,645 --> 01:47:30,913
The same guards are there who were there the previous night

3139
01:47:30,913 --> 01:47:33,624
that encountered you guys so, as you roll up with an entourage-

3140
01:47:33,624 --> 01:47:35,779
Sam: How many are there?

3141
01:47:35,779 --> 01:47:38,108
Matt: Currently, there are four.

3142
01:47:38,108 --> 01:47:39,873
Travis: We can take them.

3143
01:47:39,873 --> 01:47:43,157
Laura: Hi. I wave at Thompson.

3144
01:47:43,157 --> 01:47:45,437
Matt: He's actually not there.

3145
01:47:45,437 --> 01:47:46,961
It's the two others that were with you.

3146
01:47:46,961 --> 01:47:48,505
He is noticeably absent.

3147
01:47:48,505 --> 01:47:50,480
Vex: Oh. Oh, where's Thompson?

3148
01:47:50,480 --> 01:47:52,062
Matt: They look at each other and they're like,

3149
01:47:52,062 --> 01:47:53,227
"He's been given the day off."

3150
01:47:53,227 --> 01:47:54,867
Vex: Oh, really?

3151
01:47:54,867 --> 01:47:57,143
Vax: But as you can see, we brought one of your citizens

3152
01:47:57,143 --> 01:47:59,072
with us to show us a tour of the city.

3153
01:47:59,072 --> 01:48:00,891
Sam: That's you.

3154
01:48:00,891 --> 01:48:02,291
Guard: Citizen? I haven't see you about.

3155
01:48:02,291 --> 01:48:03,686
What's your name?

3156
01:48:03,686 --> 01:48:08,286
Tiberius: Oh, my name is Tiberius Kraghammer.

3157
01:48:08,286 --> 01:48:11,592
(all laugh)

3158
01:48:11,592 --> 01:48:14,815
Scanlan: Like Johnny New York.

3159
01:48:14,815 --> 01:48:16,875
Tiberius: Shoot, we're in Kraghammer, right?

3160
01:48:16,875 --> 01:48:18,086
Scanlan: We're in Kraghammer.

3161
01:48:18,086 --> 01:48:19,653
Tiberius: Oh, Stronghammer.

3162
01:48:19,653 --> 01:48:21,241
Scanlan: Johnny New York.

3163
01:48:21,241 --> 01:48:24,407
Guard: So, what is it, Kraghammer, or what was it?

3164
01:48:24,407 --> 01:48:28,749
Orion: I meant, I meant Stronghammer.

3165
01:48:28,749 --> 01:48:31,241
Kraghammer is my father's cousin's side.

3166
01:48:31,241 --> 01:48:32,503
Guard: How drunk are ye?

3167
01:48:32,503 --> 01:48:34,732
Tiberius: I've been drinking since I've woken.

3168
01:48:34,732 --> 01:48:35,976
Matt: Make a persuasion check.

3169
01:48:35,976 --> 01:48:37,481
Scanlan: See, he is one of you!

3170
01:48:37,481 --> 01:48:38,871
Grog: I had a lot of breakfast.

3171
01:48:38,871 --> 01:48:40,890
Orion: Oh, yay, 19.

3172
01:48:40,890 --> 01:48:42,116
Matt: 19.

3173
01:48:42,116 --> 01:48:45,186
Travis: Tiberius Kraghammer.

3174
01:48:45,186 --> 01:48:49,855
Guard: All right, all right, I haven't seen you around

3175
01:48:49,855 --> 01:48:54,392
but obviously it's a bit early to be that fucked up.

3176
01:48:54,392 --> 01:48:56,910
Tiberius: Very impressed, you know.

3177
01:48:56,910 --> 01:49:00,204
Matt: Well,  what's your business if I might ask again?

3178
01:49:00,204 --> 01:49:01,767
You already seen the statue.

3179
01:49:01,767 --> 01:49:03,044
Vex: Yeah, we saw the statue but we wanted

3180
01:49:03,044 --> 01:49:04,706
to get a better look at it.

3181
01:49:04,706 --> 01:49:07,874
So we brought this gift for the Greyspines

3182
01:49:07,874 --> 01:49:09,819
and we wanted to present it to them.

3183
01:49:09,819 --> 01:49:12,600
Matt: The two new carvers step forward and look at it.

3184
01:49:12,600 --> 01:49:13,731
Vex: It's really nice.

3185
01:49:13,731 --> 01:49:15,285
Keyleth: Oh yes.

3186
01:49:15,285 --> 01:49:19,004
Matt: One of them's like:

3187
01:49:19,004 --> 01:49:21,771
Guard 2:  I’ll tell you what.

3188
01:49:21,771 --> 01:49:26,424
If you let us taste a bit of that, we’ll let you go.

3189
01:49:26,424 --> 01:49:30,390
Tiberius: (Slurred.) Oh, I mean, I've been drinking a lot of it, sure!

3190
01:49:30,390 --> 01:49:32,192
Laura: I mean, a thimble of it because if any of it goes missing -

3191
01:49:32,192 --> 01:49:33,348
Travis: Is it sealed? Is it sealed?

3192
01:49:33,348 --> 01:49:34,963
Laura: Is it sealed? Can we tell if it's sealed?

3193
01:49:34,963 --> 01:49:39,660
Matt: You look at it. It does not have any sort of port or exit on it.

3194
01:49:39,660 --> 01:49:41,499
It is just a solid barrel.

3195
01:49:41,499 --> 01:49:42,837
Tiberius: Maybe, we can save some for them.

3196
01:49:42,837 --> 01:49:44,217
Vex: Oh, okay. Here's the thing.

3197
01:49:44,217 --> 01:49:47,161
If we open it, it'll ruin the barrel, right?

3198
01:49:47,161 --> 01:49:49,619
Guard: Ah, that's right.

3199
01:49:49,619 --> 01:49:52,753
Vex: So, maybe we can save you a bottle of it

3200
01:49:52,753 --> 01:49:54,779
when we open it inside.

3201
01:49:54,779 --> 01:49:56,161
And we'll give it to you later.

3202
01:49:56,161 --> 01:49:57,542
Matt: Make a persuasion check for that.

3203
01:49:57,542 --> 01:49:59,682
It's a very persuasion based encounter.

3204
01:49:59,682 --> 01:50:00,760
Laura: Should I roll that one that failed me earlier

3205
01:50:00,760 --> 01:50:02,198
or my little dice?

3206
01:50:02,198 --> 01:50:03,465
Matt: The little dice! They haven't come out yet!

3207
01:50:03,465 --> 01:50:04,909
Laura: (Squeaky voice.) My little, little, tiny dice

3208
01:50:04,909 --> 01:50:05,973
Matt: Itty bitty dice.

3209
01:50:05,973 --> 01:50:07,852
Laura: Teeny tiny dice.

3210
01:50:07,852 --> 01:50:12,836
Okay that's better, I rolled a 23.

3211
01:50:12,836 --> 01:50:17,840
Matt: Okay. They all kinda look at each other.

3212
01:50:17,840 --> 01:50:20,799
Guard: If you can save enough for all four of us please do.

3213
01:50:20,799 --> 01:50:22,745
Bring it back, we’ll be looking forward to it.

3214
01:50:22,745 --> 01:50:25,799
Tiberius: Do you have any flasks that we could use to fill them up?

3215
01:50:25,799 --> 01:50:28,878
Vex: We've got some bottles don't worry.

3216
01:50:28,878 --> 01:50:30,209
Tiberius: Okay, I'm just asking.

3217
01:50:30,209 --> 01:50:32,318
Guards: We'll be waiting.

3218
01:50:32,318 --> 01:50:34,478
And if you don't show with the drink,

3219
01:50:34,478 --> 01:50:36,936
we'll go right to our supervisor.

3220
01:50:36,936 --> 01:50:38,914
Matt: They all nod.

3221
01:50:38,914 --> 01:50:40,595
Vex: Yeah, keep nodding. Here's the thing.

3222
01:50:40,595 --> 01:50:42,445
I don't know if I can save 4 bottles worth,

3223
01:50:42,445 --> 01:50:44,181
but I'll save as much as I can.

3224
01:50:44,181 --> 01:50:45,342
Scanlan and Percy: Just say yes. Just say yes.

3225
01:50:45,342 --> 01:50:48,941
Vex: Hey, I got it covered.

3226
01:50:48,941 --> 01:50:53,373
Vax: On our father's good name,

3227
01:50:53,373 --> 01:50:55,518
we will bring you some of this.

3228
01:50:55,518 --> 01:51:00,001
That is a- That is a promise.

3229
01:51:00,001 --> 01:51:02,352
Grog: It's a good name.

3230
01:51:02,352 --> 01:51:04,242
Matt: They all look about each other.

3231
01:51:04,242 --> 01:51:08,012
Guard: Fine. Remember, we're waiting.

3232
01:51:08,012 --> 01:51:09,072
Matt: They all kinda look a little,

3233
01:51:09,072 --> 01:51:12,634
they lick their lips a little.

3234
01:51:12,634 --> 01:51:15,287
They part and let you guys into the residential district.

3235
01:51:15,287 --> 01:51:17,427
You make your way to the very back.

3236
01:51:17,427 --> 01:51:18,722
You can see House Greyspine.

3237
01:51:18,722 --> 01:51:19,973
Once again guys, for those who haven't been there before,

3238
01:51:19,973 --> 01:51:21,371
it's a beautiful arrangement.

3239
01:51:21,371 --> 01:51:23,159
The iron gate around it with spikes on the top.

3240
01:51:23,159 --> 01:51:25,070
You can see the entire front yard,

3241
01:51:25,070 --> 01:51:26,905
it's about a good 80 yard walk to

3242
01:51:26,905 --> 01:51:28,778
the front of the building itself.

3243
01:51:28,778 --> 01:51:30,870
It's a quite a distance from the front gate

3244
01:51:30,870 --> 01:51:32,234
and that entire area is filled

3245
01:51:32,234 --> 01:51:33,909
with like a stone garden with various

3246
01:51:33,909 --> 01:51:37,447
small sculptures and just interesting knick knacks

3247
01:51:37,447 --> 01:51:39,330
they collected and put on display like as a small

3248
01:51:39,330 --> 01:51:43,123
museum as you approach the front of House Greyspine.

3249
01:51:43,123 --> 01:51:44,656
You get to the front door as a large

3250
01:51:44,656 --> 01:51:49,983
double oak door about 10 feet tall, 4 feet wide, currently closed.

3251
01:51:49,983 --> 01:51:52,161
There is no handle on the door.

3252
01:51:52,161 --> 01:51:53,090
Travis: No handle?

3253
01:51:53,090 --> 01:51:54,299
Matt : No.

3254
01:51:54,299 --> 01:51:56,315
Tiberius: Hold on, wait, wait, wait.

3255
01:51:56,315 --> 01:51:58,624
Don't knock on anything. Things shock you here.

3256
01:51:58,624 --> 01:52:00,696
Scanlan: Let's go knock on the door.

3257
01:52:00,696 --> 01:52:02,940
Percy: I want to double check, see if there's a bell to ring or

3258
01:52:02,940 --> 01:52:05,815
there seems to be some sort of calling -

3259
01:52:05,815 --> 01:52:07,298
Matt: Easily enough, you see next to the door

3260
01:52:07,298 --> 01:52:11,468
there is a small chain that just protrudes from the stone wall.

3261
01:52:11,468 --> 01:52:13,821
It has a small bulbous ball at the end.

3262
01:52:13,821 --> 01:52:15,251
Talisen: Ding ding. Ding-a-ding.

3263
01:52:15,251 --> 01:52:16,759
Matt: You pull it. Not a ding, but a large -

3264
01:52:16,759 --> 01:52:22,070
It is a heavier chain than you expected.

3265
01:52:22,070 --> 01:52:25,097
As you pulled on it you feel some sort a large hammer-like object

3266
01:52:25,097 --> 01:52:28,696
is slamming into a brass type material

3267
01:52:28,696 --> 01:52:30,664
as it echoes and resounds in the building.

3268
01:52:30,664 --> 01:52:32,056
Definitely announcing your presence.

3269
01:52:32,056 --> 01:52:33,999
Keyleth: Percy, can I try?

3270
01:52:33,999 --> 01:52:35,021
Percy: If you must, yes.

3271
01:52:35,021 --> 01:52:36,525
Keyleth: Okay!

3272
01:52:36,525 --> 01:52:39,693
Matt: It echoes into the house.

3273
01:52:39,693 --> 01:52:41,180
Keyleth: I just wanted to do that once!

3274
01:52:41,180 --> 01:52:42,627
Vex: Let's just hold off for now, all right.

3275
01:52:42,627 --> 01:52:44,204
Keyleth: I'm sorry.

3276
01:52:44,204 --> 01:52:45,565
Percy: You've never seen a chain to a house.

3277
01:52:45,565 --> 01:52:46,589
Scanlan: Should we ding-dong-ditch?

3278
01:52:46,589 --> 01:52:48,295
(All laugh.)

3279
01:52:48,295 --> 01:52:48,545
Vax: Scanlan perhaps a little ditty on strings

3280
01:52:48,545 --> 01:52:50,222
will ease our introduction.

3281
01:52:50,222 --> 01:52:56,286
Scanlan: I'll start singing a little jaunty welcoming song.

3282
01:52:56,286 --> 01:52:59,260
Hello, hello, we're here to pay you calling.

3283
01:52:59,260 --> 01:53:02,753
Hello, hello I don't know what rhymes with calling.

3284
01:53:02,753 --> 01:53:04,273
(All laugh.)

3285
01:53:04,273 --> 01:53:05,743
Percy: “Calling,” at the very least.

3286
01:53:05,743 --> 01:53:07,134
I thought you would go right there.

3287
01:53:07,134 --> 01:53:08,171
Scanlan: Yes, it's true.

3288
01:53:08,171 --> 01:53:10,527
Matt: Alright, are you just going to play the music

3289
01:53:10,527 --> 01:53:11,771
for the sake of playing music?

3290
01:53:11,771 --> 01:53:13,457
Sam: Yes, for now.

3291
01:53:13,457 --> 01:53:16,927
Matt: All right. About 10 seconds have passed before the door -

3292
01:53:16,927 --> 01:53:21,104
You hear a large (thump thump) and one of the doors opens up.

3293
01:53:21,104 --> 01:53:24,923
You see a dwarf, with long grey hair slicked back

3294
01:53:24,923 --> 01:53:26,500
and pulled into a ponytail.

3295
01:53:26,500 --> 01:53:29,462
A very small trimmed beard, very proper,

3296
01:53:29,462 --> 01:53:31,757
steps out in long black robes and goes:

3297
01:53:31,757 --> 01:53:34,866
Dwarf: Can I help you?

3298
01:53:34,866 --> 01:53:36,055
Grog: Percy?

3299
01:53:36,055 --> 01:53:40,833
Percy: Yes, Percival Fredrickstein Von Musel Klossowski de Rolo III.

3300
01:53:40,833 --> 01:53:42,128
Tiberius: You can call him Percy.

3301
01:53:42,128 --> 01:53:44,484
Percy: You can simply call me Percy, thank you.

3302
01:53:44,484 --> 01:53:47,639
We're here to discuss some business with Lord Greyspine

3303
01:53:47,639 --> 01:53:52,051
and we have of course brought gifts and our charming company.

3304
01:53:52,051 --> 01:53:54,676
Vax: As well as our dwarven compatriot to introduce us.

3305
01:53:54,676 --> 01:53:56,931
Tiberius: Yes, who? I am quite drunk right now.

3306
01:53:56,931 --> 01:54:00,778
Matt: He gives you an awkward look.

3307
01:54:00,778 --> 01:54:03,385
It's like a look of trying to place your face.

3308
01:54:03,385 --> 01:54:05,259
Dwarf: Which lord are you looking for?

3309
01:54:05,259 --> 01:54:08,922
Vex: Actually Nostoc.

3310
01:54:08,922 --> 01:54:12,595
Tiberius: Is he the nice one? I would like the nice one.

3311
01:54:12,595 --> 01:54:14,999
Dwarf: Nostoc, I'm afraid, is currently working at the quarry,

3312
01:54:14,999 --> 01:54:16,736
if he’s who  you're looking for.

3313
01:54:16,736 --> 01:54:17,942
Vex: Oh, of course he is.

3314
01:54:17,942 --> 01:54:21,184
Scanlan: If Gradon is here, is that his name? Gra- Gradon?

3315
01:54:21,184 --> 01:54:23,283
Matt: (Chuckles.) He gives you this look...

3316
01:54:23,283 --> 01:54:24,777
Dwarf: Gradem is not taking visitors.

3317
01:54:24,777 --> 01:54:26,346
Vex: Of course not.

3318
01:54:26,346 --> 01:54:30,554
Percy: That's a shame, we brought this half-barrel

3319
01:54:30,554 --> 01:54:31,924
of ale right here and some -

3320
01:54:31,924 --> 01:54:35,734
Scanlan: And some very, very attractive mining contracts,

3321
01:54:35,734 --> 01:54:38,236
but if there's no one here to talk about them then...

3322
01:54:38,236 --> 01:54:39,553
Matt: He gives you this look.

3323
01:54:39,553 --> 01:54:41,106
Dwarf: If you're talking mining contracts you want to go ahead

3324
01:54:41,106 --> 01:54:44,873
and head to the quarry and talk to, uh, Lord-

3325
01:54:44,873 --> 01:54:46,922
Matt: Looking him up again in my notes.

3326
01:54:46,922 --> 01:54:49,827
Dwarf: You want to talk to Nostoc Greyspine.

3327
01:54:49,827 --> 01:54:51,047
He's the one who runs the quarry.

3328
01:54:51,047 --> 01:54:53,806
As far as the Ironkeeper himself…

3329
01:54:53,806 --> 01:54:57,246
I mean no offense, but only official political business.

3330
01:54:57,246 --> 01:55:01,903
Percy: Well this is definitely official political business.

3331
01:55:01,903 --> 01:55:03,482
And I will also say, could you direct us to the quarry?

3332
01:55:03,482 --> 01:55:04,666
We are new in town.

3333
01:55:04,666 --> 01:55:06,463
Dwarf: Obviously. Have you not been shown

3334
01:55:06,463 --> 01:55:08,634
where the quarry is found?

3335
01:55:08,634 --> 01:55:11,493
Tiberius: I am new. I don't even know what's going on.

3336
01:55:11,493 --> 01:55:12,851
Sam: Jesus.

3337
01:55:12,851 --> 01:55:14,497
Percy: He's been drinking since very early this morning.

3338
01:55:14,497 --> 01:55:16,540
Keyleth: He's on vacation. You'll have to excuse him.

3339
01:55:16,540 --> 01:55:18,194
Tiberius: I must say, I am having a wonderful time.

3340
01:55:18,194 --> 01:55:20,399
Keyleth: Yeah. You know, friends are in town,

3341
01:55:20,399 --> 01:55:22,383
he's showing us around.

3342
01:55:22,383 --> 01:55:25,572
Percy: What was your name, again?

3343
01:55:25,572 --> 01:55:27,561
Matt: The dwarf kinda gives you a subtle look, goes:

3344
01:55:27,561 --> 01:55:29,259
Dwarf: My name is Margrim.

3345
01:55:29,259 --> 01:55:31,169
I am the servant of the Ironkeeper himself.

3346
01:55:31,169 --> 01:55:32,399
Vex: Of course!

3347
01:55:32,399 --> 01:55:33,952
Percy: Margrim, of course you're the servant.

3348
01:55:33,952 --> 01:55:35,882
You are filled with poise and sophistication,

3349
01:55:35,882 --> 01:55:37,946
and of course, above all, protocol.

3350
01:55:37,946 --> 01:55:39,501
I would not wish you to break protocol

3351
01:55:39,501 --> 01:55:41,248
which is why just some simple directions,

3352
01:55:41,248 --> 01:55:44,099
for those of us who are wishing to do some official business.

3353
01:55:44,099 --> 01:55:48,242
We'll be right on your way and your house will return to order.

3354
01:55:48,242 --> 01:55:56,917
Margrim: Right. The Iron Keeper is not open to business

3355
01:55:56,917 --> 01:55:59,991
outside of pre-approved political understandings.

3356
01:55:59,991 --> 01:56:01,418
Vex: Of course.

3357
01:56:01,418 --> 01:56:03,259
Margrim: If you don't have a pre-approved

3358
01:56:03,259 --> 01:56:06,660
meeting put within our ledger, you won't be seen.

3359
01:56:06,660 --> 01:56:09,686
Vex: Of course not, but for the mining contracts, however,

3360
01:56:09,686 --> 01:56:15,231
wouldn't we need to speak to Nostoc? Is there any way -

3361
01:56:15,231 --> 01:56:18,063
I hear it's very hard to get down into the mines.

3362
01:56:18,063 --> 01:56:19,646
It's very well-guarded, right?

3363
01:56:19,646 --> 01:56:21,439
That's why we came to speak to him here.

3364
01:56:21,439 --> 01:56:23,949
Matt: He leans over and looks at the cask of ale and says:

3365
01:56:23,949 --> 01:56:25,858
Margrim: Down to the mines,

3366
01:56:25,858 --> 01:56:29,549
you just have to go to one of the chain platform posts

3367
01:56:29,549 --> 01:56:31,559
at the edge of town that will bring you to the base area.

3368
01:56:31,559 --> 01:56:34,697
Find your way to the mines there.

3369
01:56:34,697 --> 01:56:36,755
That should be enough to get Nostoc’s attention.

3370
01:56:36,755 --> 01:56:38,494
The rest is up to you.

3371
01:56:38,494 --> 01:56:39,808
Vex: Lovely. Thank you so much.

3372
01:56:39,808 --> 01:56:41,920
Scanlan: One moment, before we adjourn-

3373
01:56:41,920 --> 01:56:43,683
(whispers) Do we want to try to get into this place,

3374
01:56:43,683 --> 01:56:45,619
or are we just going to go to the mines?

3375
01:56:45,619 --> 01:56:47,884
Laura: (whispers) Maybe we should just talk to Nostoc first.

3376
01:56:47,884 --> 01:56:49,486
Scanlan: And ditch this place?

3377
01:56:49,486 --> 01:56:52,150
Percy: Every time we break into someone's house it turns out poorly.

3378
01:56:52,150 --> 01:56:54,541
Vex: We're trying to get to the mines essentially, so.

3379
01:56:54,541 --> 01:56:57,086
Vax: I think he's still listening.

3380
01:56:57,086 --> 01:57:01,293
Percy: Good man, good day.

3381
01:57:01,293 --> 01:57:05,037
Vex: Margrim, you've been wonderful. Thank you so much.

3382
01:57:05,037 --> 01:57:07,221
We plan on keeping some of this ale and

3383
01:57:07,221 --> 01:57:08,855
bringing it back to the household.

3384
01:57:08,855 --> 01:57:10,882
Would you like some when we open the cask?

3385
01:57:10,882 --> 01:57:14,917
Matt: He looks down at the cask, looks up at you and says:

3386
01:57:14,917 --> 01:57:18,736
Margrim: I would not turn it down, a sip or two.

3387
01:57:18,736 --> 01:57:20,952
Vex: Lovely. We'll be sure to save you a small bottle.

3388
01:57:20,952 --> 01:57:26,228
Sam: I'm going to turn invisible.

3389
01:57:26,228 --> 01:57:28,985
Matt: As he's looking over there, you just vanish.

3390
01:57:28,985 --> 01:57:30,871
All right.

3391
01:57:30,871 --> 01:57:33,324
Marisha: You can do that?!

3392
01:57:34,131 --> 01:57:35,615
Sam: And I'm sneaking into the house.

3393
01:57:35,615 --> 01:57:36,947
Taliesin: Oh, god!

3394
01:57:36,947 --> 01:57:38,530
Liam: To what end?!

3395
01:57:38,530 --> 01:57:40,326
Travis: That's awesome! Who cares? Light it up!

3396
01:57:40,326 --> 01:57:42,089
Sam: I don't know why!

3397
01:57:42,089 --> 01:57:43,239
Travis: He's gone nuts!

3398
01:57:43,239 --> 01:57:45,986
Margrim: Is that all your business?

3399
01:57:45,986 --> 01:57:51,741
Vex: I believe it is all of our business.

3400
01:57:51,741 --> 01:57:54,261
Margrim: Well, good day.

3401
01:57:54,261 --> 01:57:55,542
Matt: And he steps back into the doorway and

3402
01:57:55,542 --> 01:57:59,940
closes the large oak doors.

3403
01:57:59,940 --> 01:58:04,306
You are now standing in the foyer of Palace Greyspine.

3404
01:58:04,306 --> 01:58:06,470
A luxurious foyer, the floor itself is

3405
01:58:06,470 --> 01:58:08,939
a fine dark velvet red carpet.

3406
01:58:08,939 --> 01:58:10,946
There are tapestries across the walls

3407
01:58:10,946 --> 01:58:13,258
and small wooden end tables set at the edges

3408
01:58:13,258 --> 01:58:16,193
of the hallway, this foyer area

3409
01:58:16,193 --> 01:58:18,597
that contains sculptures and

3410
01:58:18,597 --> 01:58:22,931
vases and plants that exist underground specifically.

3411
01:58:22,931 --> 01:58:24,759
There's a large stairway that leads up

3412
01:58:24,759 --> 01:58:25,928
into the upper portion of the house

3413
01:58:25,928 --> 01:58:26,990
and two doors at each side that lead to rooms

3414
01:58:26,990 --> 01:58:28,621
you no longer can see.

3415
01:58:28,621 --> 01:58:29,915
Orion: I use the earpiece and whisper:

3416
01:58:29,915 --> 01:58:31,166
Tiberius: What are you doing, Scanlan?!

3417
01:58:31,166 --> 01:58:32,480
What are you doing?!

3418
01:58:32,480 --> 01:58:35,865
Scanlan: I don't know! Give me twenty minutes!

3419
01:58:35,865 --> 01:58:37,279
Vex: Twenty minutes, that's okay,

3420
01:58:37,279 --> 01:58:39,451
let's all step away from the house.

3421
01:58:39,451 --> 01:58:44,463
Keyleth: Ask if he needs assistance or divergent -

3422
01:58:44,463 --> 01:58:46,280
Taliesin: Divergent?

3423
01:58:46,280 --> 01:58:49,065
Marisha: Divergent.

3424
01:58:49,065 --> 01:58:51,633
Matt: So, Margrim, of course, wipes his hands and walks away going:

3425
01:58:51,633 --> 01:58:55,523
Margrim: Ah, fucking foreigners.

3426
01:58:55,523 --> 01:58:56,950
Sam: I follow him where he's going.

3427
01:58:56,950 --> 01:58:58,330
Matt: Okay.

3428
01:58:58,330 --> 01:59:00,713
Sam: My nervousness, I let out a little bit of a fart as we -

3429
01:59:00,713 --> 01:59:02,572
(all laugh)

3430
01:59:02,572 --> 01:59:04,459
Matt: Make a stealth check.

3431
01:59:04,459 --> 01:59:06,720
Orion: Why are you making it harder on yourself?

3432
01:59:06,720 --> 01:59:12,865
Sam: 14 plus I'm invisible, plus 2. 16.

3433
01:59:12,865 --> 01:59:15,139
Matt: Because you're invisible,

3434
01:59:15,139 --> 01:59:16,365
I'll give you advantage on that.

3435
01:59:16,365 --> 01:59:17,699
Go ahead and roll.

3436
01:59:17,699 --> 01:59:22,901
Sam: Oh, well. 14. Plus 2. 16.

3437
01:59:22,901 --> 01:59:24,651
Matt: All right.

3438
01:59:24,651 --> 01:59:27,239
So, as you scamper by, behind Margrim, following him

3439
01:59:27,239 --> 01:59:30,225
towards what looks like the kitchen area of the abode,

3440
01:59:30,225 --> 01:59:34,445
Margrim stops and turns, rubs his stomach, goes "Umf,"

3441
01:59:34,445 --> 01:59:37,234
and continues walking forward,

3442
01:59:37,234 --> 01:59:41,123
seemingly unperturbed by the sound.

3443
01:59:41,123 --> 01:59:42,714
Sam: I'm just snooping around,

3444
01:59:42,714 --> 01:59:44,762
trying to see if there's any lords

3445
01:59:44,762 --> 01:59:47,553
or higher ranking individuals in the area.

3446
01:59:47,553 --> 01:59:50,829
Matt: Okay, I'll say with the time that you have

3447
01:59:50,829 --> 01:59:53,043
within the house, you wander through quite a few rooms.

3448
01:59:53,043 --> 01:59:56,034
There's a wonderful music room, which contains

3449
01:59:56,034 --> 01:59:59,231
a number of dwarven instruments that you've read of

3450
01:59:59,231 --> 02:00:00,040
and many instruments that you know as well.

3451
02:00:00,353 --> 02:00:02,393
You actually find another,

3452
02:00:02,393 --> 02:00:04,242
what do you call it again? A shawm?

3453
02:00:04,242 --> 02:00:05,130
Sam: Shawm.

3454
02:00:05,130 --> 02:00:06,530
Matt: A shawm. You find another shawm within,

3455
02:00:06,530 --> 02:00:09,112
more finely crafted than the one that you have.

3456
02:00:09,112 --> 02:00:10,200
Sam: Oh, fuck.

3457
02:00:10,200 --> 02:00:11,730
Matt: A gift of lords, if you will.

3458
02:00:11,730 --> 02:00:12,736
Sam: I'm so tempted, but no.

3459
02:00:12,736 --> 02:00:13,644
Matt: Okay.

3460
02:00:13,644 --> 02:00:14,560
Laura: Does he have an earring on?

3461
02:00:14,560 --> 02:00:15,742
Does he have one of our earrings?

3462
02:00:15,742 --> 02:00:16,742
Liam: We all do.

3463
02:00:16,742 --> 02:00:18,091
Matt: Not everyone, you only made a few.

3464
02:00:18,091 --> 02:00:20,258
Sam: Just, just me and him.

3465
02:00:20,258 --> 02:00:22,560
Sam: He can talk to me, apparently.

3466
02:00:22,560 --> 02:00:25,883
Vex: Tiberius, tell him to look for paperwork of something.

3467
02:00:25,883 --> 02:00:27,321
For the mines!

3468
02:00:27,321 --> 02:00:29,134
Tiberius: Scanlan, look for paperwork of something else,

3469
02:00:29,134 --> 02:00:30,177
and by the way,

3470
02:00:30,177 --> 02:00:32,200
all of you should be hearing me right now, you all have the ear-

3471
02:00:32,200 --> 02:00:34,014
Matt: Not everyone, you only have a few.

3472
02:00:34,014 --> 02:00:36,183
Laura: You only made like 5 or something.

3473
02:00:36,183 --> 02:00:37,771
Matt: You could only afford 5.

3474
02:00:37,771 --> 02:00:39,664
Tiberius: (clears throat) Do all those things, Scanlan.

3475
02:00:39,664 --> 02:00:40,526
Scanlan: Great.

3476
02:00:40,526 --> 02:00:42,148
Grog: Who's talking right now?

3477
02:00:42,148 --> 02:00:44,188
Matt: As you look about the household,

3478
02:00:44,188 --> 02:00:45,370
you also come across a couple of

3479
02:00:45,370 --> 02:00:49,740
bed chambers that are locked, pretty hefty lock.

3480
02:00:49,740 --> 02:00:50,426
Sam: I can try.

3481
02:00:50,426 --> 02:00:52,105
Matt: Okay. You make your way up the stairway,

3482
02:00:52,105 --> 02:00:53,614
and you can see there's a long hall that leads to,

3483
02:00:53,614 --> 02:00:55,265
essentially, a throne room that is

3484
02:00:55,265 --> 02:00:58,964
still partially under construction, mostly finished.

3485
02:00:58,964 --> 02:01:00,763
And you can see it, it actually was an

3486
02:01:00,763 --> 02:01:04,599
intentional build onto this house.

3487
02:01:04,599 --> 02:01:07,612
House Greyspine, when the current Ironkeeper

3488
02:01:07,612 --> 02:01:10,583
went into office, it seems, began to have this room built.

3489
02:01:10,583 --> 02:01:12,445
And so it's nearly finished, but it's an extravagant room

3490
02:01:12,445 --> 02:01:16,058
with a large stone and dark metal throne,

3491
02:01:16,058 --> 02:01:17,966
steps lead up to it, and its raised dais-like

3492
02:01:17,966 --> 02:01:20,156
pedestal in the center of the room.

3493
02:01:20,156 --> 02:01:24,419
You can see a series of great magically glowing and flickering

3494
02:01:24,419 --> 02:01:25,998
lanterns across them.

3495
02:01:25,998 --> 02:01:27,037
And you see there are two dwarves inside

3496
02:01:27,037 --> 02:01:29,006
that are currently finishing up the stone work.

3497
02:01:29,006 --> 02:01:30,760
They're just doing various sorts of masonry

3498
02:01:30,760 --> 02:01:31,942
and plastering in areas and carving out

3499
02:01:31,942 --> 02:01:33,584
and chiselling out pieces of stone,

3500
02:01:33,584 --> 02:01:35,415
and making them intricately carved in this flavour.

3501
02:01:35,415 --> 02:01:37,057
But other than that the room is currently empty.

3502
02:01:37,057 --> 02:01:39,906
Sam: Shit. There's nothing to steal!

3503
02:01:39,906 --> 02:01:41,189
Travis: Drop a deuce in the bedroom!

3504
02:01:41,189 --> 02:01:43,463
(all laugh)

3505
02:01:43,463 --> 02:01:46,391
Matt: #gnomishdeuce.

3506
02:01:46,391 --> 02:01:47,685
Tiberius: Dammit, Scanlan! Just get out of there!

3507
02:01:47,685 --> 02:01:48,874
What are you doing?

3508
02:01:48,874 --> 02:01:50,115
Laura: You totally should!

3509
02:01:50,115 --> 02:01:51,555
Travis: An invisible poo!

3510
02:01:51,555 --> 02:01:52,997
Laura: Invisible poo!

3511
02:01:52,997 --> 02:01:55,295
Sam: I’m, ah- I might as well try one of the doors that's locked,

3512
02:01:55,295 --> 02:01:58,782
and see if I can pick it, but I'm not good at that, so I'll try.

3513
02:01:58,782 --> 02:02:02,719
Matt: Okay. Do you have on your person any sort of thieves' tools?

3514
02:02:02,719 --> 02:02:04,758
Sam: I have a forgery kit, a poisoner's kit-

3515
02:02:04,758 --> 02:02:07,672
Marisha: Forge some thieves' tools real quick.

3516
02:02:07,672 --> 02:02:10,778
Sam: Climbing gear?

3517
02:02:10,778 --> 02:02:13,929
And a whip.

3518
02:02:13,929 --> 02:02:15,486
Liam: I have one of the earrings, and I say:

3519
02:02:15,486 --> 02:02:19,611
Vax: Scanlan, what exactly is the purpose for this little escapade,

3520
02:02:19,611 --> 02:02:22,556
and will it be ending shortly?

3521
02:02:22,556 --> 02:02:23,996
Sam: Can I reply?

3522
02:02:23,996 --> 02:02:27,292
Matt: You can, through the message-based ear enchantment.

3523
02:02:27,292 --> 02:02:30,351
Scanlan: Just trust me, that I have no idea what I'm doing.

3524
02:02:30,351 --> 02:02:32,488
(all laugh)

3525
02:02:32,488 --> 02:02:34,375
Matt: So, do you wish to pick one of the doors?

3526
02:02:34,375 --> 02:02:35,492
Travis: Do it.

3527
02:02:35,492 --> 02:02:36,761
Laura: Do it! Try it! And then run away.

3528
02:02:36,761 --> 02:02:38,264
Sam: Yeah, I'm gonna try one!

3529
02:02:38,264 --> 02:02:39,581
Matt: Okay, you have disadvantage on this.

3530
02:02:39,581 --> 02:02:40,738
Sam: Of course I do.

3531
02:02:40,738 --> 02:02:42,182
Travis: I love how we're just watching this happen.

3532
02:02:42,182 --> 02:02:43,904
Vax: Pike will mourn your death.

3533
02:02:43,904 --> 02:02:45,119
Matt: So roll twice, and we'll consider this a -

3534
02:02:45,119 --> 02:02:46,546
We'll say just a straight dexterity check.

3535
02:02:46,546 --> 02:02:48,616
Sam: Eleven, plus… zero?

3536
02:02:48,616 --> 02:02:54,146
Matt: You futz with the door for a good minute,

3537
02:02:54,146 --> 02:02:56,252
trying to bend a piece of wire you had,

3538
02:02:56,252 --> 02:02:59,374
thinking to forge some tumblers,

3539
02:02:59,374 --> 02:03:00,438
and eventually get to a point where you hear:

3540
02:03:00,438 --> 02:03:02,738
(tink)

3541
02:03:02,738 --> 02:03:03,877
And it broke.

3542
02:03:03,877 --> 02:03:06,046
(all laugh)

3543
02:03:06,046 --> 02:03:07,499
Sam: I can't do two spells at once,

3544
02:03:07,499 --> 02:03:13,013
so I will give it give it up and I'll make my way to the door.

3545
02:03:13,013 --> 02:03:14,912
Matt: Okay. The door is currently closed.

3546
02:03:14,912 --> 02:03:21,408
Sam: I become un-invisible and I cast Dimension Door.

3547
02:03:21,408 --> 02:03:22,838
Matt: All right.

3548
02:03:22,838 --> 02:03:24,680
Matt: You- (Whoosh.) -blink through this small,

3549
02:03:24,680 --> 02:03:26,820
purplish arcane doorway,

3550
02:03:26,820 --> 02:03:28,517
it brings you directly outside.

3551
02:03:28,517 --> 02:03:30,750
You guys are waiting, Scanlan just pops into view, ‘Ah!’

3552
02:03:30,750 --> 02:03:33,195
Scanlan: It was crazy in there!

3553
02:03:33,195 --> 02:03:35,231
People were farting everywhere!

3554
02:03:35,231 --> 02:03:36,628
(all laugh)

3555
02:03:36,628 --> 02:03:38,028
Tiberius: Really, Scanlan.

3556
02:03:38,028 --> 02:03:42,499
Scanlan: It was not me. They're building a throne room,

3557
02:03:42,499 --> 02:03:45,464
there were some locked doors, man I wish you could have been there,

3558
02:03:45,464 --> 02:03:47,995
it was exciting, but ultimately pointless.

3559
02:03:47,995 --> 02:03:49,406
So let's go down to the mines!

3560
02:03:49,406 --> 02:03:51,821
(All laugh.)

3561
02:03:51,821 --> 02:03:53,295
Vax: I would like to stress again that

3562
02:03:53,295 --> 02:03:56,973
none of these dwarves are our enemies, at all.

3563
02:03:56,973 --> 02:03:59,098
Vex: Soon, I'm sure.

3564
02:03:59,098 --> 02:04:01,272
Vax: We just want to go have some words with Greyspine.

3565
02:04:01,272 --> 02:04:03,195
Grog: And that we do not have our healer, at present.

3566
02:04:03,195 --> 02:04:05,068
Vax: Well we do, but she's very distracted,

3567
02:04:05,068 --> 02:04:06,619
and is not feeling herself.

3568
02:04:06,619 --> 02:04:08,232
Vex: She's very quiet.

3569
02:04:08,232 --> 02:04:09,815
Scanlan: She wanted to stay at the inn this morning.

3570
02:04:09,815 --> 02:04:11,701
Vax: She's feeling awfully BAFTA today, so.

3571
02:04:11,701 --> 02:04:12,981
(All laugh.)

3572
02:04:12,981 --> 02:04:15,739
Scanlan: Let's make our way to the mines, shall we?

3573
02:04:15,739 --> 02:04:17,929
Grog: To the mines, then, yeah.

3574
02:04:17,929 --> 02:04:19,420
Laura: Yes.

3575
02:04:19,420 --> 02:04:20,876
Vax: Let's go get this drunk dwarf!

3576
02:04:20,876 --> 02:04:22,856
Matt: Yes, the bard was doing a lockpick with no lockpicks.

3577
02:04:22,856 --> 02:04:26,005
He was fashioning it from wire.

3578
02:04:26,005 --> 02:04:28,100
Exciting but pointless! All right.

3579
02:04:28,100 --> 02:04:30,705
So, you, you make your way to the edge of the centre ring.

3580
02:04:30,705 --> 02:04:34,681
You find that there are long spiral staircases that move

3581
02:04:34,681 --> 02:04:36,871
to the bottom, where there are elevators

3582
02:04:36,871 --> 02:04:38,406
that bring you to the bottom floor.

3583
02:04:38,406 --> 02:04:43,685
The elevators are chain based, like a ratchet-type system

3584
02:04:43,685 --> 02:04:46,888
with two carvers there, of course.

3585
02:04:46,888 --> 02:04:49,412
As you approach one, eventually you talk with them,

3586
02:04:49,412 --> 02:04:51,091
they lead you down there, but once again they give you

3587
02:04:51,091 --> 02:04:53,087
a look of, “Watch your back!”

3588
02:04:53,087 --> 02:04:54,832
Laura: We point at the ale and give him a thumbs up!

3589
02:04:54,832 --> 02:04:57,837
Matt: They nod, and let you pass.

3590
02:04:57,837 --> 02:05:01,272
As you continue downward into the lower area,

3591
02:05:01,272 --> 02:05:02,892
you can see the red stone that lets a lot

3592
02:05:02,892 --> 02:05:07,708
of the atmospheric glow of Kraghammer is used less and less

3593
02:05:07,708 --> 02:05:10,901
and a lot more central torches are now in place; sconces.

3594
02:05:10,901 --> 02:05:13,373
Almost like the stone itself is either just rarer

3595
02:05:13,373 --> 02:05:16,843
the further down you go or has less of an illuminating power

3596
02:05:16,843 --> 02:05:19,347
the deeper into the earth.

3597
02:05:19,347 --> 02:05:20,992
Laura: (whispering) Okay, now I'm nervous.

3598
02:05:20,992 --> 02:05:22,810
Matt: You eventually reach into the center part of town.

3599
02:05:23,256 --> 02:05:25,523
You now see from where you are standing a number of large structures

3600
02:05:25,523 --> 02:05:27,407
in the very, very center of the bottom part

3601
02:05:27,407 --> 02:05:29,190
of the city of Kraghammer.

3602
02:05:33,919 --> 02:05:35,146
You can see there is a giant domed temple

3603
02:05:36,317 --> 02:05:39,725
that is made of like gold and bronze in the center.

3604
02:05:42,504 --> 02:05:44,260
It looks almost like a gargantuan gazebo that has

3605
02:05:44,260 --> 02:05:46,626
doorways on each side that is currently closed off.

3606
02:05:46,626 --> 02:05:48,550
No guards at it though.

3607
02:05:48,550 --> 02:05:50,548
You do see a number of other buildings.

3608
02:05:50,548 --> 02:05:52,862
There is a large, large, heavy, heavy looking foundry

3609
02:05:52,862 --> 02:05:56,211
far off to the left of you that has a little bit of smoke

3610
02:05:56,211 --> 02:05:57,622
that's coming off of it, but most

3611
02:05:57,622 --> 02:06:01,977
of it looks to be filtered into a giant, metallic funnel

3612
02:06:01,977 --> 02:06:04,265
that is then placed into the rock.

3613
02:06:04,265 --> 02:06:05,921
Almost like all the smoke based exhaust is being funneled

3614
02:06:05,921 --> 02:06:08,320
outside of the mountain.

3615
02:06:08,320 --> 02:06:10,568
That is the closest; that's the foundry.

3616
02:06:10,568 --> 02:06:13,296
And then to the right of you, you wander a bit

3617
02:06:13,296 --> 02:06:16,737
and you can begin to see that part of the mountainside

3618
02:06:16,737 --> 02:06:19,688
to the far right has that look of a strip mine,

3619
02:06:19,688 --> 02:06:22,834
or like a large portion of the minerals has been pulled away

3620
02:06:22,834 --> 02:06:24,642
and is currently being mined further.

3621
02:06:24,642 --> 02:06:25,722
So that looks like probably

3622
02:06:25,722 --> 02:06:31,476
one of the better places to look in looking for the Greyspine Quarry.

3623
02:06:31,476 --> 02:06:33,535
You eventually make your way to the outside of the quarry.

3624
02:06:33,535 --> 02:06:36,445
You now look down into three large pits that just descend

3625
02:06:36,445 --> 02:06:38,833
deeply into the side of the mountain.

3626
02:06:38,833 --> 02:06:40,636
This mine has been going for quite

3627
02:06:40,636 --> 02:06:42,873
some time and a large chunk of this looks like

3628
02:06:42,873 --> 02:06:44,699
it may be being prepped;

3629
02:06:44,699 --> 02:06:46,659
almost like the mine is what's growing Kraghammer.

3630
02:06:46,659 --> 02:06:48,319
The more they mine into the mountain,

3631
02:06:48,319 --> 02:06:50,367
the more they fill the mined area

3632
02:06:50,367 --> 02:06:52,393
with further city construction.

3633
02:06:52,393 --> 02:06:55,630
It's this self perpetuating cycle of expanding the city downward.

3634
02:06:55,630 --> 02:06:57,119
Currently in the quarry,

3635
02:06:57,119 --> 02:06:59,000
you can see there are a number of large, stone, dwarven buildings

3636
02:06:59,000 --> 02:07:00,815
in the edge of it, one of which is the largest of them all,

3637
02:07:00,815 --> 02:07:05,405
looks like it's made more of a black and red, iron aesthetic;

3638
02:07:05,405 --> 02:07:08,066
some of it's been oxidized a little bit and has that rough

3639
02:07:08,066 --> 02:07:10,401
and tumble, iron feel.

3640
02:07:10,401 --> 02:07:13,688
And that one has the most guards around the base of it.

3641
02:07:13,688 --> 02:07:15,803
The carvers are gathered entirely around it.

3642
02:07:15,803 --> 02:07:18,521
Matt: Looking down into the center of the quarry, you can see

3643
02:07:18,521 --> 02:07:21,020
towards the bottom there are a number of tunnels that lead into

3644
02:07:21,020 --> 02:07:25,265
the hillside of Cliffkeep Mountains proper, surrounding Kraghammer.

3645
02:07:26,981 --> 02:07:28,436
Grog: Let's go where the guards are.

3646
02:07:28,436 --> 02:07:29,573
Vex: Let's walk towards the guards.

3647
02:07:29,573 --> 02:07:31,121
Vax: Let's just do this directly, I think.

3648
02:07:31,121 --> 02:07:33,393
Scanlan: Just swords out.

3649
02:07:33,393 --> 02:07:37,506
Keyleth: Wait wait, wait. Before we go up, I take the cask of ale

3650
02:07:37,506 --> 02:07:41,371
and I grow some pretty flowers on it, and I make a nice pretty

3651
02:07:41,371 --> 02:07:43,798
bow and I shine it up a little.

3652
02:07:43,798 --> 02:07:46,653
Vax: Good work, hippy.

3653
02:07:48,621 --> 02:07:49,532
Percy: You're making a fruit basket?

3654
02:07:50,861 --> 02:07:52,276
Keyleth: No, I’m just - it looks attractive now.

3655
02:07:52,276 --> 02:07:53,868
Percy: Like a fruit basket. It looks like a fruit basket.

3656
02:07:53,868 --> 02:07:55,047
Keyleth: It does not look like a fruit basket.

3657
02:07:55,047 --> 02:07:56,127
It's not that ostentatious.

3658
02:07:56,127 --> 02:07:57,645
Percy: It's the "Ale of the Month" Club.

3659
02:07:57,645 --> 02:07:59,752
Vax: In her defense, they probably don't see flowers too often.

3660
02:07:59,752 --> 02:08:00,944
It's a nice touch.

3661
02:08:00,944 --> 02:08:02,422
Percy: That is very fair.

3662
02:08:02,422 --> 02:08:04,789
Orion: I'm going to take this opportunity to cast Stoneskin on myself.

3663
02:08:04,789 --> 02:08:06,692
Matt: Okay. Stoneskin is placed on you.

3664
02:08:06,692 --> 02:08:07,900
Sam: Are you a dwarf still?

3665
02:08:07,900 --> 02:08:09,500
Taliesin: Are you a dwarf made of stone?

3666
02:08:09,500 --> 02:08:11,005
Matt: You have not turned Alter Self off.

3667
02:08:11,005 --> 02:08:12,302
You are still a dwarf.

3668
02:08:12,302 --> 02:08:13,964
Orion: Yeah, that's fine.

3669
02:08:13,964 --> 02:08:15,704
Matt: Oh, Stoneskin is a concentration spell, so yes,

3670
02:08:15,704 --> 02:08:17,590
that would eliminate the Alter Self spell.

3671
02:08:17,590 --> 02:08:19,789
Okay, so you revert back to your dragon form, robed self,

3672
02:08:19,789 --> 02:08:22,572
but Stoneskin is in effect.

3673
02:08:22,572 --> 02:08:25,382
Matt: You using your, what's it called again?

3674
02:08:25,382 --> 02:08:27,869
Marisha: Druidcraft. It's really creative.

3675
02:08:27,869 --> 02:08:28,947
Matt: Druidcraft! Thank you.

3676
02:08:28,947 --> 02:08:31,595
The Prestidigitation for hippies.

3677
02:08:31,595 --> 02:08:34,240
Portions of the wood begin to sprout from the outside of this dark

3678
02:08:34,240 --> 02:08:37,157
wood barrel and form these entangled ivy vines that eventually

3679
02:08:37,157 --> 02:08:41,655
embrace the entirety of this cask with little buds of dark,

3680
02:08:41,655 --> 02:08:43,572
ruddy flowers.

3681
02:08:43,572 --> 02:08:45,702
Something that would definitely appeal to a dwarven aesthetic.

3682
02:08:45,702 --> 02:08:47,559
Marisha: That's hot.

3683
02:08:47,559 --> 02:08:49,519
Matt: You approach the guards, of which there are

3684
02:08:49,519 --> 02:08:51,492
eight currently at the front.

3685
02:08:51,492 --> 02:08:55,233
Laura: Can I see which one of them; use my perception to see

3686
02:08:55,233 --> 02:08:58,675
which one of them looks maybe the most interested or weakest -

3687
02:08:58,675 --> 02:09:00,504
Matt: Would be more of an insight.

3688
02:09:00,504 --> 02:09:02,666
Laura: Insight! Which one of them looks most interested in our party.

3689
02:09:02,666 --> 02:09:06,394
Matt: Yeah, go ahead and roll.

3690
02:09:06,394 --> 02:09:09,501
Laura: Oh, good. I thought that was a 1 but it's not.

3691
02:09:10,958 --> 02:09:12,660
It was a 13.

3692
02:09:12,660 --> 02:09:14,058
Matt: 13? Okay. Strangely enough they are fairly

3693
02:09:14,058 --> 02:09:17,370
distracted and after a rather long,

3694
02:09:17,370 --> 02:09:20,606
uneventful morning most of them are just used to being in armor

3695
02:09:20,606 --> 02:09:23,446
and waiting for business to go down.

3696
02:09:23,446 --> 02:09:25,720
There are a few along the edges that look a little more alert,

3697
02:09:25,720 --> 02:09:30,915
and one of them is looking occasionally down into the quarry.

3698
02:09:30,915 --> 02:09:32,966
Just keeping an eye on the established area.

3699
02:09:32,966 --> 02:09:34,911
Laura: Which one looks like the newest?

3700
02:09:34,911 --> 02:09:36,965
Matt: The newest of the bunch would be the one

3701
02:09:36,965 --> 02:09:40,365
that's on the far left that is looking down into the quarry as well.

3702
02:09:40,365 --> 02:09:44,128
He has a shaved head, has a small brownish beard

3703
02:09:44,128 --> 02:09:45,712
that looks like he's just starting to grow out

3704
02:09:45,712 --> 02:09:47,230
into a nice, long tuft.

3705
02:09:47,230 --> 02:09:48,340
Either it got shaved in some, I don't know,

3706
02:09:48,340 --> 02:09:51,342
terrible college dwarf accident.

3707
02:09:51,342 --> 02:09:55,099
You know part of his entry into some fraternity.

3708
02:09:55,099 --> 02:09:58,269
Grog: Dwarf culture. Dwarf Sigma Sigma.

3709
02:09:58,269 --> 02:10:04,253
Matt: It's a fairly thick tuft of unkempt brown beard

3710
02:10:04,253 --> 02:10:05,771
that goes about that far out.

3711
02:10:05,771 --> 02:10:08,270
It's just starting to be pulled in like tiny little scruffy braids.

3712
02:10:08,270 --> 02:10:10,142
It's not quite there and he probably gets a lot of shit for it

3713
02:10:10,142 --> 02:10:11,440
from the other dwarves.

3714
02:10:11,440 --> 02:10:14,279
But he seems to generally be looking at you guys.

3715
02:10:14,279 --> 02:10:16,434
Vax:: Okay, work your magic.

3716
02:10:16,434 --> 02:10:18,381
Grog: Yeah, do your thing… fuck these dwarves up.

3717
02:10:18,381 --> 02:10:19,912
Vex: No, well, I was just - I just wanted to know -

3718
02:10:19,912 --> 02:10:21,631
Scanlan: What are we trying to do?

3719
02:10:21,631 --> 02:10:24,432
Vex: We brought this gift. Um, hello!

3720
02:10:24,432 --> 02:10:28,010
And we just address all of them, maybe, right now, yeah?

3721
02:10:28,010 --> 02:10:29,260
Percy: She is better at this,

3722
02:10:29,260 --> 02:10:30,710
I am just going to let her do this.

3723
02:10:30,710 --> 02:10:32,215
Vex and Scanlan: Hello, hi!

3724
02:10:32,215 --> 02:10:34,198
Tiberius: Greetings and salutations!

3725
02:10:34,198 --> 02:10:36,861
Matt: The other guards reach back and grab their weapons.

3726
02:10:36,861 --> 02:10:38,450
One of them looking to you.

3727
02:10:38,450 --> 02:10:40,667
Tiberius: Oh, you don't need that.

3728
02:10:40,667 --> 02:10:42,300
Vex: I look over at the shaved-head one

3729
02:10:42,300 --> 02:10:45,168
and I hold his gaze for a little bit.

3730
02:10:45,168 --> 02:10:47,772
Vax: I give Vex a little push forward.

3731
02:10:47,772 --> 02:10:51,837
Dwarven guard: All right, what's your business?

3732
02:10:51,837 --> 02:10:55,083
Vex: Oh, yes, well... we are here to speak with Nostoc.

3733
02:10:55,083 --> 02:11:00,408
We brought a gift for him that's quite remarkable actually.

3734
02:11:00,408 --> 02:11:05,013
Matt: They curl up around the apparent barrel that Grog's holding.

3735
02:11:05,013 --> 02:11:07,604
They look wary of Grog but once they make note

3736
02:11:07,604 --> 02:11:08,673
of the barrel they all -

3737
02:11:08,673 --> 02:11:10,323
Guards: Ooooh.

3738
02:11:10,323 --> 02:11:11,529
Grog: Right? It’s the shit.

3739
02:11:11,529 --> 02:11:13,525
(all laugh)

3740
02:11:13,525 --> 02:11:14,842
Dwarven guard: I’ve heard of this,

3741
02:11:14,842 --> 02:11:16,853
but I have not seen anyone actually drink it.

3742
02:11:16,853 --> 02:11:19,591
There were long standing rumours that this even existed.

3743
02:11:19,591 --> 02:11:20,646
Vex: It exists.

3744
02:11:20,646 --> 02:11:22,294
Scanlan: And it's for Nostoc.

3745
02:11:22,294 --> 02:11:23,636
Dwarven guard: This is a Balgus original?

3746
02:11:23,636 --> 02:11:24,839
Vex: Yes.

3747
02:11:24,839 --> 02:11:27,380
Dwarven guard: Signed by himself I see on the burned, emblazoned wood.

3748
02:11:27,380 --> 02:11:29,945
I'll go talk to him!

3749
02:11:29,945 --> 02:11:31,155
Matt: And he heads inside of the building,

3750
02:11:31,155 --> 02:11:32,217
the doors close behind him.

3751
02:11:32,217 --> 02:11:35,077
The other guards encroach, keeping a very keen eye,

3752
02:11:35,077 --> 02:11:37,760
each one having a bead on the rest of your group.

3753
02:11:37,760 --> 02:11:39,940
About two minutes pass before he comes back,

3754
02:11:39,940 --> 02:11:41,845
opens the door and goes:

3755
02:11:41,845 --> 02:11:43,091
Dwarven guard: Nostoc will see you briefly,

3756
02:11:43,091 --> 02:11:45,338
but you best bring the gift.

3757
02:11:45,338 --> 02:11:46,962
I think that's what's holding his interest.

3758
02:11:46,962 --> 02:11:48,037
Vex: Of course.

3759
02:11:48,037 --> 02:11:48,906
Tiberius: Wonderful!

3760
02:11:48,906 --> 02:11:50,762
Dwarven guard: Inside, please.

3761
02:11:50,762 --> 02:11:53,535
Matt: And him and one other guard flank you guys as you enter,

3762
02:11:53,535 --> 02:11:55,940
making sure that you are not left without that appearance.

3763
02:11:55,940 --> 02:11:58,103
As you are led into the center of this portion

3764
02:11:58,103 --> 02:12:00,600
of the mine's main structure,

3765
02:12:00,600 --> 02:12:02,808
a series of long hallways, you can see there is this general smell

3766
02:12:02,808 --> 02:12:08,338
of soot and ash and broken stone dust in the air.

3767
02:12:08,338 --> 02:12:10,549
A hint of brimstone-ish kind of a smell.

3768
02:12:10,549 --> 02:12:13,536
It's not very pleasant, it's very well worn and pungent

3769
02:12:13,536 --> 02:12:16,000
for those of you who spend most of their time on the surface.

3770
02:12:16,000 --> 02:12:18,741
As you enter there is a general dust in the air,

3771
02:12:18,741 --> 02:12:21,790
a little light seems to peek through from the torches

3772
02:12:21,790 --> 02:12:23,644
that are placed up along the wall.

3773
02:12:23,644 --> 02:12:27,340
You can see this general haze amongst the interior here.

3774
02:12:27,340 --> 02:12:29,533
It is definitely a work environment at the base of an underground

3775
02:12:29,533 --> 02:12:31,591
dwarven establishment used to mine.

3776
02:12:31,591 --> 02:12:34,234
You are led further down the hallway.

3777
02:12:34,234 --> 02:12:36,211
It curves to the left and you are brought

3778
02:12:36,211 --> 02:12:38,682
into a large dwarven study.

3779
02:12:38,682 --> 02:12:40,297
You can see there are books on the walls,

3780
02:12:40,297 --> 02:12:41,972
a series of ledgers and paper stacks

3781
02:12:41,972 --> 02:12:43,153
on a large desk and at the center

3782
02:12:43,153 --> 02:12:46,465
there sits a dwarf with fiery red hair cut very short,

3783
02:12:46,465 --> 02:12:48,054
almost like a buzz-cut on the top,

3784
02:12:48,054 --> 02:12:51,113
with a long, long, long beard that is not braided

3785
02:12:51,113 --> 02:12:55,770
but just kept very smooth and very… not curly, not bunched,

3786
02:12:55,770 --> 02:12:58,429
it's a very straight beard.

3787
02:12:58,429 --> 02:13:00,350
He is very clean cut, he already has this

3788
02:13:00,350 --> 02:13:02,245
intimidating dark glare.

3789
02:13:02,245 --> 02:13:03,952
As you walk into the room he goes:

3790
02:13:03,952 --> 02:13:07,420
Nostoc Greyspine: Okay, you brought me a drink.

3791
02:13:07,420 --> 02:13:09,501
You have my attention.

3792
02:13:09,501 --> 02:13:12,836
What brings you to the mines?

3793
02:13:12,836 --> 02:13:16,582
Scanlan: We should have talked this through before.

3794
02:13:16,582 --> 02:13:18,027
Percy: Well, several things actually.

3795
02:13:18,027 --> 02:13:19,866
Several things bring us to the mine.

3796
02:13:19,866 --> 02:13:20,821
My name of course is

3797
02:13:20,821 --> 02:13:23,507
Percival Fredrickstein Von Musel Klossowski de Rolo III.

3798
02:13:23,507 --> 02:13:25,680
Everyone: You can call him Percy!

3799
02:13:25,680 --> 02:13:27,553
Matt: He raises his finger and goes:

3800
02:13:27,553 --> 02:13:30,101
Nostoc: You have not paid for your pleasantries yet.

3801
02:13:30,101 --> 02:13:32,662
Vex: Oh, of course, of course. Grog, if you would.

3802
02:13:32,662 --> 02:13:35,557
Liam: Tap that motherfucker!

3803
02:13:42,944 --> 02:13:45,940
Travis: I am assuming he had a goblet on the table.

3804
02:13:46,990 --> 02:13:48,830
Matt: As you pour it up he pulls under his desk

3805
02:13:48,830 --> 02:13:50,762
and pulls up a goblet.

3806
02:13:50,762 --> 02:13:52,022
As you fill it -

3807
02:13:52,022 --> 02:13:56,044
Nostoc: Top it off! Thank you!

3808
02:13:56,044 --> 02:13:58,179
Now put on the side of the desk!

3809
02:13:58,521 --> 02:14:00,613
Scanlan: Wait! Mister Greyspine -

3810
02:14:00,613 --> 02:14:03,108
Oh, okay, all right.

3811
02:14:03,108 --> 02:14:04,950
Matt: Puts it down.

3812
02:14:04,950 --> 02:14:08,324
Nostoc: (satisfied sigh)

3813
02:14:08,324 --> 02:14:11,859
Vex: Is it as amazing as we've heard?

3814
02:14:11,859 --> 02:14:15,503
Nostoc: It's pretty fucking good.

3815
02:14:15,503 --> 02:14:17,861
Matt: He takes another long drag, just -

3816
02:14:17,861 --> 02:14:20,300
while making sure you all watch him do this.

3817
02:14:20,300 --> 02:14:22,512
This goes on probably a little longer, the pageantry

3818
02:14:22,512 --> 02:14:25,017
of him drinking this in front of you is definitely a power play,

3819
02:14:25,017 --> 02:14:29,780
and he is establishing some sort of unspoken dominance in the room.

3820
02:14:29,780 --> 02:14:30,971
Eventually he finishes his tankard,

3821
02:14:30,971 --> 02:14:34,050
sets it down under the desk again.

3822
02:14:34,050 --> 02:14:37,596
Nostoc: Right… so. Where were we?

3823
02:14:37,596 --> 02:14:40,240
Percy: We were here to call upon your expertise.

3824
02:14:40,240 --> 02:14:43,380
We imagine that we are not the first strangers to

3825
02:14:43,380 --> 02:14:45,608
Kraghammer to come through -

3826
02:14:45,608 --> 02:14:46,725
Vex: -  in the last few weeks.

3827
02:14:46,725 --> 02:14:49,355
Percy: - in the last few weeks.

3828
02:14:49,355 --> 02:14:53,882
We believe one of our compatriots had some dealings with you,

3829
02:14:53,882 --> 02:14:59,375
perhaps not as… pleasant as the dealings we are hoping to have.

3830
02:14:59,375 --> 02:15:01,748
Scanlan: A lady, in fact.

3831
02:15:01,748 --> 02:15:03,669
Vex: A halfling.

3832
02:15:03,669 --> 02:15:04,794
Matt: At which point, as you say that,

3833
02:15:04,794 --> 02:15:06,970
he gets this grin to his face and goes:

3834
02:15:06,970 --> 02:15:08,955
Nostoc: Aye, I know of the one you speak.

3835
02:15:08,955 --> 02:15:10,419
Vex: Yes.

3836
02:15:10,419 --> 02:15:12,480
Nostoc: She is a strong-headed one, that one.

3837
02:15:12,480 --> 02:15:13,459
Percy: Yes.

3838
02:15:13,459 --> 02:15:17,460
Nostoc: She stepped on a few toes around this place.

3839
02:15:17,460 --> 02:15:20,029
Tiberius: Oh, is she clumsy?

3840
02:15:21,032 --> 02:15:25,180
Nostoc: One could say that, aye.

3841
02:15:25,180 --> 02:15:27,799
You say you are compatriots of hers?

3842
02:15:27,799 --> 02:15:32,747
Percy: We are here to mend any broken bridges, so to speak.

3843
02:15:32,747 --> 02:15:35,240
Keyleth: Or broken toes, if you will.

3844
02:15:35,240 --> 02:15:37,457
Nostoc: She certainly left a mess in her wake.

3845
02:15:37,457 --> 02:15:39,793
There's this strange vision quest she kept talking about.

3846
02:15:39,793 --> 02:15:42,352
It brought her into atmospheres…

3847
02:15:42,352 --> 02:15:44,511
portions of this city, portions of my business

3848
02:15:44,511 --> 02:15:47,706
that she has no right trespassing on.

3849
02:15:47,706 --> 02:15:50,195
She went against carver rules,

3850
02:15:50,195 --> 02:15:52,426
she broke away from partial arrest

3851
02:15:52,426 --> 02:15:55,436
and she went screaming down into the caverns of our mines

3852
02:15:55,436 --> 02:15:57,532
without my permission, blade drawn

3853
02:15:57,532 --> 02:16:00,505
on some crazed suicide mission.

3854
02:16:00,505 --> 02:16:04,601
Vex: You know what? We'll go after her.

3855
02:16:04,601 --> 02:16:05,761
We'll bring her out.

3856
02:16:05,761 --> 02:16:07,542
We'll get her out of your mines.

3857
02:16:07,542 --> 02:16:09,335
Nostoc: Great. I'd like that actually.

3858
02:16:09,335 --> 02:16:10,442
Vex: Good!

3859
02:16:10,442 --> 02:16:12,785
Percy: And we'd be happy to clear out anything unpleasant

3860
02:16:12,785 --> 02:16:15,276
that we happen to find in there in the meantime.

3861
02:16:15,276 --> 02:16:17,873
Tiberius: How did she look?

3862
02:16:17,873 --> 02:16:19,526
Grog: What?

3863
02:16:19,526 --> 02:16:21,905
Nostoc: She looked small and angry.

3864
02:16:21,905 --> 02:16:25,299
She seemed to have some weight to her.

3865
02:16:25,299 --> 02:16:27,339
She was a strong lass.

3866
02:16:27,339 --> 02:16:28,959
Tiberius: So not a looker is what you are saying.

3867
02:16:28,959 --> 02:16:30,435
Keyleth: That's not very nice.

3868
02:16:30,435 --> 02:16:31,621
Matt: And he gives you this strange look and goes:

3869
02:16:31,621 --> 02:16:36,602
Nostoc: I will not discuss the physical aesthetics of a halfling.

3870
02:16:36,602 --> 02:16:38,501
Sam: The dwarf is a feminist.

3871
02:16:38,501 --> 02:16:42,463
Vex: How much would this task be worth to you?

3872
02:16:42,463 --> 02:16:43,666
Obviously we are doing you quite a favour

3873
02:16:43,666 --> 02:16:47,803
and we brought you quite a gift!

3874
02:16:47,803 --> 02:16:50,160
Scanlan: This cost us a thousand gold.

3875
02:16:50,160 --> 02:16:51,512
Tiberius (quietly to Scanlan): Did it?

3876
02:16:51,512 --> 02:16:54,068
Nostoc: Obviously this lass means a lot to you, doesn't she?

3877
02:16:54,068 --> 02:16:56,182
Vex: No, no, no, but I know she is probably

3878
02:16:56,182 --> 02:16:59,886
wreaking havoc on your mines.

3879
02:16:59,886 --> 02:17:01,925
Vax: We've come to correct the wrongs

3880
02:17:01,925 --> 02:17:04,996
that she's done and come to bring her home.

3881
02:17:04,996 --> 02:17:07,093
Keyleth: It also sounds like there are some other

3882
02:17:07,093 --> 02:17:10,305
terrible things wreaking havoc on your mines.

3883
02:17:10,305 --> 02:17:12,474
Nostoc: There is nothing going on, we're fine.

3884
02:17:12,474 --> 02:17:13,807
We have everything under control,

3885
02:17:13,807 --> 02:17:15,333
we don't need your help for that.

3886
02:17:15,333 --> 02:17:16,523
If you want to find your friend,

3887
02:17:16,523 --> 02:17:19,249
go find her! If she is still alive.

3888
02:17:19,249 --> 02:17:22,144
If not, take her corpse back and leave.

3889
02:17:22,144 --> 02:17:23,341
Percy: It's not help, sir.

3890
02:17:23,341 --> 02:17:25,471
We are simply respecting you as a businessman.

3891
02:17:25,471 --> 02:17:26,585
And as a businessman I am sure

3892
02:17:26,585 --> 02:17:31,536
that you would disagree with unceremonious charity

3893
02:17:31,536 --> 02:17:34,756
whether it would be to give it or receive it.

3894
02:17:34,756 --> 02:17:36,595
We are making sure that our dealings with you

3895
02:17:36,595 --> 02:17:39,159
are fair and balanced.

3896
02:17:39,159 --> 02:17:41,429
Nostoc: I appreciate your offering.

3897
02:17:41,429 --> 02:17:43,275
You have bought your time.

3898
02:17:43,275 --> 02:17:46,236
Now, if you are here to go find your friend I’ll let you pass.

3899
02:17:46,236 --> 02:17:48,218
You may pass into the mine.

3900
02:17:48,218 --> 02:17:50,813
But - if at any moment you cross over

3901
02:17:50,813 --> 02:17:54,228
to any sort of thieving bullshite -

3902
02:17:54,228 --> 02:17:57,348
Matt: Looks over at you.

3903
02:17:57,348 --> 02:18:04,186
Nostoc: - I recommend that you fall down the same path

3904
02:18:04,186 --> 02:18:08,249
your friend likely did and get killed real quick.

3905
02:18:08,249 --> 02:18:10,603
I don't take kindly to those who cross on my business.

3906
02:18:10,603 --> 02:18:12,907
Percy: I doubt that we could find anything of more value

3907
02:18:12,907 --> 02:18:15,033
that what we have already brought you.

3908
02:18:15,033 --> 02:18:18,008
Vax: We are here to right wrongs and I promise you,

3909
02:18:18,008 --> 02:18:20,993
our business is finding her and returning home.

3910
02:18:20,993 --> 02:18:22,266
Nostoc: Then go.

3911
02:18:22,266 --> 02:18:23,749
Vex'ahlia: Is that our business?

3912
02:18:23,749 --> 02:18:26,763
Grog: Yeah, we are here to right wrongs and right lefts.

3913
02:18:26,763 --> 02:18:30,309
Percy: And write comment cards.

3914
02:18:30,309 --> 02:18:32,194
Marisha: Wait, before we dive into this mountain -

3915
02:18:32,194 --> 02:18:36,314
we know that there's ghouls and god knows what else down there.

3916
02:18:36,314 --> 02:18:38,554
Shouldn't we find out?

3917
02:18:38,554 --> 02:18:40,529
Tiberius: Yes we should. Maybe some arcane house could tell us

3918
02:18:40,529 --> 02:18:42,305
how to deal with these things.

3919
02:18:42,305 --> 02:18:43,931
Vex'ahlia: Yes, yes, yes, yes.

3920
02:18:43,931 --> 02:18:46,462
Do we have permission to enter within the next few days?

3921
02:18:46,462 --> 02:18:48,494
Obviously we might need to be prepared.

3922
02:18:48,494 --> 02:18:50,633
Tiberius: Yes do we have badges that we wear over -

3923
02:18:50,633 --> 02:18:53,250
so that they know -

3924
02:18:56,924 --> 02:19:02,276
Nostoc: I'll speak with the men. They’ll let you down.

3925
02:19:02,276 --> 02:19:05,893
If you come back, good on you.

3926
02:19:07,131 --> 02:19:08,683
I think our business here is done.

3927
02:19:08,683 --> 02:19:09,578
Percy: Yes.

3928
02:19:09,578 --> 02:19:11,138
Tiberius: Very good!

3929
02:19:11,138 --> 02:19:14,521
Matt: At which point you hear muffled in the distance

3930
02:19:14,521 --> 02:19:17,676
a loud ringing of a very loud bell.

3931
02:19:18,961 --> 02:19:21,691
At which point he kinda perks up a bit.

3932
02:19:21,691 --> 02:19:24,894
Nostoc: Our business here is done.

3933
02:19:24,894 --> 02:19:26,616
Please, shove off.

3934
02:19:26,616 --> 02:19:28,310
Scanlan: Which way do we go?

3935
02:19:28,310 --> 02:19:32,450
Matt: He looks over to the two other guards who are up front.

3936
02:19:32,450 --> 02:19:35,297
The two carvers say, “This way.”

3937
02:19:35,297 --> 02:19:38,982
Liam: While he is talking I take a flask out of my cloak and

3938
02:19:38,982 --> 02:19:42,502
approach the barrel and surreptitiously pour

3939
02:19:42,502 --> 02:19:44,674
a little bit of it into the flask.

3940
02:19:44,674 --> 02:19:46,022
Matt: Sleight of hand check.

3941
02:19:46,022 --> 02:19:47,313
Sam: Oh Jesus. You’re stealing beer?!

3942
02:19:47,313 --> 02:19:49,287
Orion: No, no, because we have to give it to those guards.

3943
02:19:49,287 --> 02:19:50,883
Sam: Fuck those guards, I can kill them all.

3944
02:19:50,883 --> 02:19:55,448
Travis: Roll, roll, roll you bastard, roll.

3945
02:19:55,448 --> 02:19:58,289
Laura: Can I talk to good old Nostoc while he's doing that?

3946
02:19:58,289 --> 02:19:59,441
Matt: He currently does not seem like

3947
02:19:59,441 --> 02:20:00,883
the talkative type at the moment,

3948
02:20:00,883 --> 02:20:02,359
you can certainly try.

3949
02:20:02,359 --> 02:20:03,870
Taliesin: I am going to make a fumble.

3950
02:20:03,870 --> 02:20:05,705
I am going to attempt to assist a slight of hand

3951
02:20:05,705 --> 02:20:06,879
with a bit of a fumble.

3952
02:20:06,879 --> 02:20:08,259
Matt: He has already rolled it.

3953
02:20:08,259 --> 02:20:09,683
Laura: Damn it. I am going to fall down.

3954
02:20:09,683 --> 02:20:11,245
In front of Nostoc.

3955
02:20:11,245 --> 02:20:12,248
Sam: Oh!

3956
02:20:12,248 --> 02:20:13,857
Liam: 13.

3957
02:20:13,857 --> 02:20:15,058
Sam: No chance.

3958
02:20:15,058 --> 02:20:16,906
Laura: I am going to fall down in front of Nostoc.

3959
02:20:16,906 --> 02:20:18,092
Liam: 13.

3960
02:20:18,092 --> 02:20:19,628
Marisha: Come on!

3961
02:20:19,628 --> 02:20:21,401
Taliesin: He is distracted by a bell.

3962
02:20:21,401 --> 02:20:22,690
Matt: As you fill your flask...

3963
02:20:22,690 --> 02:20:25,958
(all groan)

3964
02:20:27,392 --> 02:20:31,708
Matt: You hear this loud - (clears throat) -

3965
02:20:32,420 --> 02:20:35,086
Vex: Ow, ow, oh my ankle.

3966
02:20:35,086 --> 02:20:37,340
(all laugh)

3967
02:20:37,340 --> 02:20:39,605
Vex: It hurts so very much.

3968
02:20:39,605 --> 02:20:43,480
Matt: This is the first time you have witnessed

3969
02:20:43,480 --> 02:20:50,596
the pristine, delicate yet well trained palm of a dwarven hand

3970
02:20:50,596 --> 02:20:52,601
go straight to its forehead.

3971
02:20:52,601 --> 02:20:55,059
(all laugh)

3972
02:20:55,059 --> 02:20:57,527
Vax: I carry the flask up to his cup and refill it and say,

3973
02:20:57,527 --> 02:21:02,838
“In my kingdom when a deal is set we drink together.

3974
02:21:02,838 --> 02:21:07,475
And I would like, not much, but to just pour us all a drink

3975
02:21:07,475 --> 02:21:12,056
and agree, surely this cask is weeks worth of-”

3976
02:21:12,056 --> 02:21:17,026
Nostoc: Get out of my office.

3977
02:21:17,026 --> 02:21:18,158
Sam: Let’s just go.

3978
02:21:18,158 --> 02:21:19,749
Marisha: Take the flask.

3979
02:21:19,749 --> 02:21:22,440
Vax: I can see it is a cultural difference, my apologies.

3980
02:21:22,440 --> 02:21:25,785
Tiberius: Stop it. Just go! What are you doing?

3981
02:21:25,785 --> 02:21:27,453
Liam: You’re one to talk!

3982
02:21:27,453 --> 02:21:29,373
Orion: I am on the earring.

3983
02:21:29,373 --> 02:21:31,725
Matt: At which point, a second and a third bell starts going off

3984
02:21:36,076 --> 02:21:36,326
and the guards that are waiting for you guys -

3985
02:21:37,706 --> 02:21:37,995
they start leading you outside

3986
02:21:37,995 --> 02:21:39,528
and as you make your way outside the main building,

3987
02:21:42,806 --> 02:21:45,011
you can now hear voices shouting, down the quarry below.

3988
02:21:46,206 --> 02:21:47,797
Laura: I lean down to one of the guards and say:

3989
02:21:48,786 --> 02:21:49,201
Vex: What is that bell for?

3990
02:21:50,366 --> 02:21:50,642
Dwarf Guard: Something is flushing out of the quarry.

3991
02:21:51,779 --> 02:21:52,571
Laura: Flushing, what does that mean?

3992
02:21:54,066 --> 02:21:54,454
Dwarf Guard: We don't know.

3993
02:21:55,992 --> 02:21:56,355
Matt: At which point some of the guards are

3994
02:21:57,684 --> 02:21:58,406
motioning each other to follow and some of them

3995
02:21:59,657 --> 02:22:00,305
start going down to one of the tracks that leads down

3996
02:22:01,334 --> 02:22:01,584
to one of the nearest quarry below.

3997
02:22:04,469 --> 02:22:06,602
Taliesin: Just try and like practically usher

3998
02:22:06,602 --> 02:22:07,717
our guards in that direction,

3999
02:22:07,840 --> 02:22:09,195
since they seem to want to go in that direction.

4000
02:22:09,666 --> 02:22:11,063
Let’s see if we can push them in that direction.

4001
02:22:11,063 --> 02:22:13,587
Matt: Okay, you guys follow down towards the quarry,

4002
02:22:13,706 --> 02:22:15,358
you ask the guard that question and he goes:

4003
02:22:16,155 --> 02:22:16,772
Guard: I don't know, we have had quite a few

4004
02:22:18,266 --> 02:22:18,685
interesting things come through.

4005
02:22:19,838 --> 02:22:20,804
Vex: Like what? Oh, like what?

4006
02:22:21,906 --> 02:22:22,303
Travis: He already said.

4007
02:22:23,129 --> 02:22:23,742
Matt: He kinda swallows and says:

4008
02:22:24,869 --> 02:22:25,119
Guard: Things I can't describe.

4009
02:22:25,119 --> 02:22:26,967
Percy: Well, we can certainly help, lead on.

4010
02:22:29,096 --> 02:22:29,986
Marisha: Is there anybody running out?

4011
02:22:31,747 --> 02:22:34,194
Matt: Not yet. As you head halfway down the quarry walkway,

4012
02:22:34,313 --> 02:22:35,961
you begin seeing dwarves start running out

4013
02:22:38,611 --> 02:22:38,861
of one of the large quarry tunnels.

4014
02:22:38,861 --> 02:22:41,235
Marisha: I grab one of them.

4015
02:22:41,606 --> 02:22:42,810
Matt: Well, they are quite a distance from you.

4016
02:22:43,726 --> 02:22:44,649
You are still walking down the side.

4017
02:22:45,884 --> 02:22:46,134
They’re a good 100 feet from you.

4018
02:22:46,966 --> 02:22:47,356
Marisha: Okay.

4019
02:22:48,749 --> 02:22:49,053
Matt: They start running at you, you see blood

4020
02:22:49,053 --> 02:22:50,200
streaking down one of their faces.

4021
02:22:50,606 --> 02:22:51,234
Grog: Yes!

4022
02:22:51,234 --> 02:22:52,704
Matt: They're charging out, one of them has a weapon and is limping,

4023
02:22:55,306 --> 02:22:56,739
and you start seeing small green scampering things rushing through.

4024
02:23:00,626 --> 02:23:01,240
1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 10, goblins come rushing out of the tunnel.

4025
02:23:01,240 --> 02:23:02,352
Marisha: Oh, shit!

4026
02:23:03,026 --> 02:23:04,400
Scanlan: Aah, I don’t like these guys.

4027
02:23:04,566 --> 02:23:07,045
Marisha: Don’t you have a family history or something?

4028
02:23:07,647 --> 02:23:09,362
Laura: We should attack them! I string my bow.

4029
02:23:09,746 --> 02:23:11,239
Matt: The three dwarves that are running out, one of them gets

4030
02:23:11,986 --> 02:23:12,945
hacked down by one of the goblins and jumps on them

4031
02:23:13,506 --> 02:23:14,584
and is tearing his neck.

4032
02:23:15,186 --> 02:23:15,723
Taliesin: I take a shot. Right now.

4033
02:23:16,266 --> 02:23:16,575
Laura: I take a shot. I shoot it!

4034
02:23:17,529 --> 02:23:17,779
Matt: Okay, both you guys roll -

4035
02:23:18,326 --> 02:23:18,870
Liam: I throw a dagger.

4036
02:23:18,870 --> 02:23:19,900
Matt: You throw a dagger?

4037
02:23:19,926 --> 02:23:20,967
Liam: Yeah.

4038
02:23:20,967 --> 02:23:22,047
Matt: Three of you, roll for attack.

4039
02:23:22,047 --> 02:23:24,630
Taliesin: 19.

4040
02:23:24,630 --> 02:23:25,881
Laura: 15.

4041
02:23:25,881 --> 02:23:28,531
Orion: Is there a clear area with just a bunch of goblins running?

4042
02:23:28,531 --> 02:23:30,628
Matt: There is an open, almost like a funnel towards the tunnel.

4043
02:23:30,628 --> 02:23:33,581
Orion: I’m gonna throw a little fireball, right there.

4044
02:23:33,581 --> 02:23:35,231
Where those guys are.

4045
02:23:35,231 --> 02:23:37,158
Matt: Okay, so you guys you all hit from this distance

4046
02:23:37,158 --> 02:23:39,245
because goblins are puny little things.

4047
02:23:39,245 --> 02:23:40,383
They are still a little small to see but you are all

4048
02:23:40,383 --> 02:23:42,415
pretty well trained and pretty honed with your aim.

4049
02:23:42,415 --> 02:23:44,851
You fire, simultaneously, gunshots echo through the hallway,

4050
02:23:44,851 --> 02:23:49,443
arrows, flying dagger, you see three goblins

4051
02:23:49,443 --> 02:23:52,177
just fall off a nearby dwarf who goes:

4052
02:23:52,177 --> 02:23:53,930
Dwarf: Unh, thank -

4053
02:23:53,930 --> 02:23:56,737
Matt: - at which point a large fireball explodes,

4054
02:23:56,737 --> 02:23:59,829
killing off about 10 or so of the goblins.

4055
02:23:59,829 --> 02:24:01,521
And probably 2 of the dwarves.

4056
02:24:01,521 --> 02:24:03,908
Tiberius: I am sorry about that.

4057
02:24:03,908 --> 02:24:06,887
Matt: At which point, the guards kinda stopped.

4058
02:24:06,887 --> 02:24:07,860
Scanlan: Did you do that?

4059
02:24:07,860 --> 02:24:08,629
Tiberius: Yeah.

4060
02:24:08,629 --> 02:24:09,683
Scanlan: Fuck.

4061
02:24:09,683 --> 02:24:11,146
Matt: And they they start looking around and

4062
02:24:11,146 --> 02:24:12,504
they see you pull out your weapons and they all

4063
02:24:12,504 --> 02:24:13,874
take a step back and realise

4064
02:24:13,874 --> 02:24:15,326
they don't want to die either.

4065
02:24:15,326 --> 02:24:17,263
Guard: Well go, if you’re going to help, go!

4066
02:24:17,263 --> 02:24:18,681
Percy: We run straight in.

4067
02:24:18,681 --> 02:24:20,445
Matt: With you guys charging in, you can now see

4068
02:24:20,445 --> 02:24:21,646
a handful more goblins are rushing out.

4069
02:24:21,646 --> 02:24:23,202
They are like running really fast, sprinting -

4070
02:24:23,202 --> 02:24:26,577
Keyleth: I throw Entangle up, in the distance

4071
02:24:26,577 --> 02:24:30,586
where they’re coming from.

4072
02:24:30,586 --> 02:24:32,117
Matt: Okay, what’s the radius on that?

4073
02:24:32,117 --> 02:24:33,575
Marisha: Like a hundred feet.

4074
02:24:33,575 --> 02:24:34,691
Matt: That's the range. What is the radius?

4075
02:24:34,691 --> 02:24:37,495
Marisha: Oh, 20 foot radius.

4076
02:24:37,495 --> 02:24:38,620
Matt: 20 foot radius. Okay.

4077
02:24:38,620 --> 02:24:42,543
So you find a portion of the central part

4078
02:24:42,543 --> 02:24:44,650
where the things exit from the tunnel and

4079
02:24:44,650 --> 02:24:46,167
you see these strange reddish vines begin

4080
02:24:46,167 --> 02:24:47,559
to protrude and to begin to grab

4081
02:24:47,559 --> 02:24:49,559
nearby goblins and pull them up in this massive,

4082
02:24:49,559 --> 02:24:53,917
weird vine creature.

4083
02:24:53,917 --> 02:24:56,454
At which point you hear - (stomp stomp) - and you now see two

4084
02:24:56,454 --> 02:24:58,907
larger ogre-like creatures come storming out.

4085
02:24:58,907 --> 02:25:00,144
Keyleth: Oh, shit!

4086
02:25:00,144 --> 02:25:01,665
Tiberius: Wonderful!

4087
02:25:01,665 --> 02:25:02,814
Laura: Ogres?

4088
02:25:02,814 --> 02:25:04,079
Matt: Everyone roll initiative.

4089
02:25:04,079 --> 02:25:06,975
(all cheer)

4090
02:25:06,975 --> 02:25:09,725
Marisha: Oh, fuck. Goddammit.

4091
02:25:09,725 --> 02:25:12,384
Orion: Fuck yeah.

4092
02:25:12,384 --> 02:25:15,359
Travis: Take it!

4093
02:25:18,243 --> 02:25:22,332
Matt: All right, do we have initiatives 25 to 20?

4094
02:25:22,332 --> 02:25:23,489
Taliesin: 27.

4095
02:25:26,223 --> 02:25:26,686
Marisha: Holy shit! You rolled a 20?

4096
02:25:28,102 --> 02:25:28,617
Taliesin: I rolled a 20 plus 7.

4097
02:25:30,057 --> 02:25:30,745
Orion: 21.

4098
02:25:30,745 --> 02:25:31,706
Laura: Oh I didn't roll yet. Wait, wait! I didn't roll yet.

4099
02:25:31,722 --> 02:25:32,945
Matt: Okay, 21 you said?

4100
02:25:33,482 --> 02:25:33,862
Orion: I have 21.

4101
02:25:34,582 --> 02:25:34,898
Matt: 21 for Tiberius.

4102
02:25:34,898 --> 02:25:35,682
What did you get?

4103
02:25:35,682 --> 02:25:36,667
One?

4104
02:25:36,667 --> 02:25:37,825
Awww.

4105
02:25:37,825 --> 02:25:38,651
Marisha: Oh, I rolled a 2.

4106
02:25:38,651 --> 02:25:39,792
Liam: Well, wait. It's 6 with the plus.

4107
02:25:39,792 --> 02:25:41,926
Scanlan: Fellows. I don't like goblins.

4108
02:25:41,926 --> 02:25:42,968
Laura: 18.

4109
02:25:42,968 --> 02:25:44,924
Matt: You now see Scanlan, who’s usually a jovial individual,

4110
02:25:44,924 --> 02:25:46,919
his eyes begin to tense with fury.

4111
02:25:46,919 --> 02:25:48,607
Scanlan: I don't like goblins.

4112
02:25:48,607 --> 02:25:50,023
Keyleth: Is there anything that you know?

4113
02:25:50,023 --> 02:25:55,939
Scanlan: No, they will all die. Don't spare any of them.

4114
02:25:55,939 --> 02:25:57,174
Travis: Copy that.

4115
02:25:57,174 --> 02:25:58,991
Laura: 18.

4116
02:25:58,991 --> 02:26:00,547
Matt: All right, so we have -

4117
02:26:00,547 --> 02:26:01,673
Travis: 18 too.

4118
02:26:01,673 --> 02:26:05,913
Taliesin: 27!

4119
02:26:05,913 --> 02:26:07,002
Laura: What?!

4120
02:26:07,002 --> 02:26:08,080
Travis: Yeah, buddy.

4121
02:26:08,080 --> 02:26:10,012
Taliesin: I have 27 initiative.

4122
02:26:10,012 --> 02:26:15,144
Matt: 15 to 10? 10 to 5? 6.

4123
02:26:15,144 --> 02:26:17,334
Taliesin: Wow, oh my god.

4124
02:26:17,334 --> 02:26:18,556
Sam: I got a three.

4125
02:26:18,556 --> 02:26:21,154
Matt: Okay. (laughs) All right.

4126
02:26:21,154 --> 02:26:24,534
Marisha: 4.

4127
02:26:24,534 --> 02:26:25,955
Liam: It was a sudden attack, man.

4128
02:26:25,955 --> 02:26:27,838
Sam: We weren't ready.

4129
02:26:27,838 --> 02:26:29,342
Matt: You got a 3.

4130
02:26:29,342 --> 02:26:31,424
Marisha: To be fair I just cast entangle. It kinda works.

4131
02:26:31,424 --> 02:26:33,926
I'm distracted holding entangle.

4132
02:26:33,926 --> 02:26:35,246
Matt: Yeah, it's fine. All right.

4133
02:26:35,246 --> 02:26:36,722
And then we have Scanlan.

4134
02:26:36,722 --> 02:26:38,334
I'll get you guys in placement here,

4135
02:26:39,646 --> 02:26:42,998
as your bear is currently back at the inn.

4136
02:26:42,998 --> 02:26:43,707
Laura: He is still?

4137
02:26:43,707 --> 02:26:45,662
Matt: Unless you wanted to bring him along.

4138
02:26:45,662 --> 02:26:46,602
Taliesin: I thought we brought him along.

4139
02:26:46,602 --> 02:26:48,242
Laura: Well, I thought I brought him.

4140
02:26:48,242 --> 02:26:49,422
I should have mentioned that.

4141
02:26:49,422 --> 02:26:51,073
Matt: All right, we'll say you brought him along.

4142
02:26:51,073 --> 02:26:51,909
Laura: Okay.

4143
02:26:51,909 --> 02:26:52,702
Matt: That's fine.

4144
02:26:52,702 --> 02:26:54,042
Laura: I'm sorry, I should have emphasized that more.

4145
02:26:54,042 --> 02:26:55,724
Matt: Do keep in mind... That's all right.

4146
02:26:55,724 --> 02:27:02,080
Those of you going first we're going to keep you on the field here.

4147
02:27:04,342 --> 02:27:05,558
Laura: Oh, god.

4148
02:27:06,322 --> 02:27:10,923
Matt: A number of goblins that are currently held over here.

4149
02:27:12,164 --> 02:27:15,622
Sam: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

4150
02:27:15,622 --> 02:27:17,142
Laura: They're easy. Goblins are easy.

4151
02:27:17,142 --> 02:27:18,520
Orcs, orcs are not.

4152
02:27:18,520 --> 02:27:19,662
Travis: Yeah, those are mine.

4153
02:27:19,662 --> 02:27:20,882
Liam: Ogres.

4154
02:27:20,882 --> 02:27:21,812
Laura: Ogres?!

4155
02:27:21,812 --> 02:27:24,308
Matt: All righty. So top of the round, Percy you're up.

4156
02:27:24,308 --> 02:27:26,391
Percy: I'm sitting down and I'm busting out Bad News.

4157
02:27:26,391 --> 02:27:28,221
Marisha: Bust out Bad News!

4158
02:27:28,221 --> 02:27:30,982
Matt: Okay. So Percy stops just as he gets to the quarry,

4159
02:27:30,982 --> 02:27:33,662
a little bit elevated, and he pulls out

4160
02:27:33,662 --> 02:27:36,802
from a small sack on his back this large elongated contraption,

4161
02:27:36,802 --> 02:27:39,602
this weird construction that looks similar to

4162
02:27:39,602 --> 02:27:41,132
the Pepperbox he usually carries,

4163
02:27:41,132 --> 02:27:43,017
but much larger and cumbersome.

4164
02:27:43,017 --> 02:27:45,737
He sets it up on the ground with a small stand at the front

4165
02:27:45,737 --> 02:27:47,995
and preps itself with a visual point.

4166
02:27:47,995 --> 02:27:49,821
Percy: Ogre.

4167
02:27:49,821 --> 02:27:50,502
Matt: Ogre back here?

4168
02:27:50,502 --> 02:27:51,752
Percy: Yup.

4169
02:27:51,752 --> 02:27:53,456
Matt: All right, go ahead and roll for your attack with Bad News.

4170
02:27:53,456 --> 02:27:54,835
Marisha: Have you used it before?

4171
02:27:54,835 --> 02:27:56,840
Taliesin: Nope, first time.

4172
02:27:56,840 --> 02:28:00,254
Matt: His own tinkered construction, Bad News.

4173
02:28:00,254 --> 02:28:03,162
Taliesin: That's a... 30 attack.

4174
02:28:03,162 --> 02:28:06,687
Matt: Yup, that'll do it. Go ahead and roll damage.

4175
02:28:06,687 --> 02:28:07,897
Marisha: Does that critical for you?

4176
02:28:07,897 --> 02:28:10,082
Taliesin: 19 actually might.

4177
02:28:10,082 --> 02:28:11,234
Matt: Natural 19?

4178
02:28:11,234 --> 02:28:12,288
Taliesin: Natural 19.

4179
02:28:12,288 --> 02:28:13,181
Matt: Yeah, that should critical for you.

4180
02:28:13,181 --> 02:28:14,460
Taliesin: That does critical for me.

4181
02:28:14,460 --> 02:28:16,653
I've never criticaled with this either.

4182
02:28:16,653 --> 02:28:17,862
What does that mean?

4183
02:28:17,862 --> 02:28:20,142
Matt: That means the damage dice you double.

4184
02:28:20,142 --> 02:28:21,062
Taliesin: Oh, perfect.

4185
02:28:21,062 --> 02:28:22,402
Matt: So, roll for damage, double that,

4186
02:28:22,402 --> 02:28:24,199
and add your modifier after that.

4187
02:28:24,199 --> 02:28:25,562
Marisha: Come on, come on, come on!

4188
02:28:25,562 --> 02:28:26,795
Big money, no whammies.

4189
02:28:26,795 --> 02:28:29,242
Yeah! Hell yeah!

4190
02:28:29,242 --> 02:28:30,593
Taliesin: 22, 23, 24, 25, 26.

4191
02:28:30,593 --> 02:28:32,402
27 points of damage.

4192
02:28:32,402 --> 02:28:33,821
Travis: Get after it, big man!

4193
02:28:33,821 --> 02:28:35,052
Marisha: Is that doubled?

4194
02:28:35,052 --> 02:28:36,329
Taliesin: That's doubled.

4195
02:28:36,329 --> 02:28:37,082
Matt: All right, so.

4196
02:28:37,082 --> 02:28:39,302
You guys hear this cacophonous (explosion),

4197
02:28:39,302 --> 02:28:41,790
this large blasting sound, a flash of blue energy and sparks

4198
02:28:41,790 --> 02:28:43,562
shoot out the back of the weapon.

4199
02:28:43,562 --> 02:28:45,922
It actually lifts Percy off the ground for a second

4200
02:28:45,922 --> 02:28:48,062
and he shifts himself from the sheer blast.

4201
02:28:48,062 --> 02:28:48,949
Laura: Woah!

4202
02:28:48,949 --> 02:28:51,102
Taliesin: I built a sniper rifle.

4203
02:28:51,102 --> 02:28:53,497
Matt: This streaking, heated bullet, almost reddish, white hot,

4204
02:28:53,497 --> 02:28:55,122
goes cascading through the air,

4205
02:28:55,122 --> 02:28:56,378
plunges into the side of the ogre's shoulder

4206
02:28:56,378 --> 02:28:59,410
with a smattering of blood splattering against the cave behind it.

4207
02:28:59,410 --> 02:29:02,102
It's actually moved back a step and has to catch itself.

4208
02:29:02,102 --> 02:29:07,212
Slams its club into the ground.

4209
02:29:07,212 --> 02:29:08,523
That ends your turn?

4210
02:29:08,523 --> 02:29:10,102
Taliesin: I can't do anything after that.

4211
02:29:10,102 --> 02:29:11,802
That's just reload.

4212
02:29:11,802 --> 02:29:13,173
Matt: All right, Tiberius you're up.

4213
02:29:13,173 --> 02:29:15,862
Orion: I move within 60 feet of those big fellows.

4214
02:29:15,862 --> 02:29:17,696
Taliesin: Bad News travels far and fast.

4215
02:29:17,696 --> 02:29:20,039
Marisha: Nothing travels faster.

4216
02:29:20,039 --> 02:29:21,317
Matt: This is the entanglement by the way.

4217
02:29:21,317 --> 02:29:22,834
Laura: Oh, okay.

4218
02:29:22,834 --> 02:29:25,282
Orion: Right before there.

4219
02:29:25,282 --> 02:29:26,396
Matt: Everything there is kinda fighting from the entanglement.

4220
02:29:26,396 --> 02:29:27,029
Orion: Great.

4221
02:29:27,029 --> 02:29:28,822
Matt: Most of these goblins are currently inside of it.

4222
02:29:28,822 --> 02:29:31,602
Orion: I'm gonna shoot a Scorching Ray at the big guy.

4223
02:29:31,602 --> 02:29:33,562
Matt: Both of them?

4224
02:29:33,562 --> 02:29:35,365
Sam: He said he moved - he moved within 60 feet of them.

4225
02:29:35,365 --> 02:29:37,619
Matt: So, you moved up to here? All righty.

4226
02:29:37,619 --> 02:29:39,602
Marisha: And they're all entangled, yeah?

4227
02:29:39,602 --> 02:29:41,442
Orion: That's good right there.

4228
02:29:41,442 --> 02:29:42,912
Marisha: Still have Entagle up.

4229
02:29:42,912 --> 02:29:43,642
Matt: These guys here are entangled.

4230
02:29:43,642 --> 02:29:45,415
These front goblins are not.

4231
02:29:45,415 --> 02:29:47,271
Scorching ray you said at which ones?

4232
02:29:47,271 --> 02:29:48,905
Orion: Actually, oh there's a bunch of those dudes, aren't there?

4233
02:29:48,905 --> 02:29:52,402
I'm gonna do a fireball instead.

4234
02:29:52,402 --> 02:29:55,102
Right in the center of the juiciness where

4235
02:29:55,102 --> 02:29:57,297
I can get a couple little guys and both the big guys.

4236
02:29:57,297 --> 02:30:00,922
Matt: All right, so I'd probably about there would be where you'd want it.

4237
02:30:00,922 --> 02:30:02,482
Orion: I'm gonna do that, and I'm gonna spend

4238
02:30:02,482 --> 02:30:04,719
two sorcerer points immediately to do quickening spell

4239
02:30:04,719 --> 02:30:06,847
and do another spell right after that.

4240
02:30:06,847 --> 02:30:09,797
Matt: Okay. So as you rush up, you pull back your hand

4241
02:30:09,797 --> 02:30:11,682
and you see the arcane red energy begin to flow in your palm.

4242
02:30:11,682 --> 02:30:14,882
You then throw the beam out, and it arcs, slams into the center,

4243
02:30:14,882 --> 02:30:17,142
and explodes hitting each of these five goblins

4244
02:30:17,142 --> 02:30:19,022
and the two ogres.

4245
02:30:19,022 --> 02:30:21,382
What's your DC on your spell?

4246
02:30:21,382 --> 02:30:23,862
Orion: My DC on my spell is...

4247
02:30:23,862 --> 02:30:25,962
Matt: Top of your spell page. On the right.

4248
02:30:25,962 --> 02:30:28,102
Orion: Oh! Wait. Oh! Seventeen, sorry.

4249
02:30:28,102 --> 02:30:31,946
Matt: Seventeen, okay. Wow! The two ogres actually make their saving throws.

4250
02:30:31,946 --> 02:30:32,562
Laura: Ugh!

4251
02:30:32,562 --> 02:30:33,922
Marisha: Boo!

4252
02:30:33,922 --> 02:30:35,139
Matt: They got eighteen and a nineteen.

4253
02:30:35,139 --> 02:30:36,896
Travis: Roll crappier, ogres!

4254
02:30:36,896 --> 02:30:40,050
Matt: The goblins, however, all disintegrate.

4255
02:30:40,050 --> 02:30:40,902
Laura: All of them?

4256
02:30:40,902 --> 02:30:43,118
Matt: There's no way they're gonna survive the damage you -

4257
02:30:43,118 --> 02:30:44,922
they just (poof noise).

4258
02:30:44,922 --> 02:30:48,362
You see this hint of a red ash mist just go, "Eee!"

4259
02:30:48,362 --> 02:30:51,982
where they once were, and they are all turned to black nothingness.

4260
02:30:51,982 --> 02:30:54,086
However, roll damage for the ogres.

4261
02:30:54,086 --> 02:30:55,771
They get half damage 'cause they made their reflex save.

4262
02:30:55,771 --> 02:30:56,442
Orion: Yeah.

4263
02:30:56,442 --> 02:30:57,862
Matt: So 8d6 damage.

4264
02:30:57,862 --> 02:31:01,422
Sam: 8d6.

4265
02:31:02,785 --> 02:31:05,254
Sam: Seven. Eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen,

4266
02:31:05,254 --> 02:31:07,003
fourteen, fifteen, sixteen, seventeen, eighteen,

4267
02:31:07,003 --> 02:31:08,288
nineteen, twenty one, twenty two, twenty three,

4268
02:31:08,288 --> 02:31:10,131
twenty four, twenty five, twenty six, twenty seven!

4269
02:31:10,131 --> 02:31:11,402
Travis: What?

4270
02:31:11,402 --> 02:31:12,305
Matt: Twenty seven, so half that.

4271
02:31:12,305 --> 02:31:17,877
Matt: Okay, so as the blast of fire dissipates,

4272
02:31:17,877 --> 02:31:21,063
you can see one of the ogres is now burnt on half of its chest.

4273
02:31:21,063 --> 02:31:22,080
Laura: Yeah, he is.

4274
02:31:22,080 --> 02:31:23,362
Matt: Looking a little rough.

4275
02:31:23,362 --> 02:31:24,942
There's blood streaking down from the side of his face

4276
02:31:24,942 --> 02:31:26,402
where the shrapnel got thrown at him.

4277
02:31:26,402 --> 02:31:27,861
And the other ogre’s looking okay.

4278
02:31:27,861 --> 02:31:28,992
Tiberius: He's a large creature isn't he?

4279
02:31:28,992 --> 02:31:29,922
Matt: Yes.

4280
02:31:29,922 --> 02:31:31,062
Orion: I'm gonna use my second spell and do Telekinesis

4281
02:31:31,062 --> 02:31:34,422
and pick one up and try to hurl him into the other one.

4282
02:31:34,422 --> 02:31:35,542
Matt: Okay.

4283
02:31:35,542 --> 02:31:37,564
Which one? The one left here?

4284
02:31:37,564 --> 02:31:38,784
Orion: The one that's beaten up already.

4285
02:31:38,784 --> 02:31:40,001
Sam: I'm hard right now!

4286
02:31:40,001 --> 02:31:41,953
(all laugh)

4287
02:31:41,953 --> 02:31:43,142
Matt: He does fail his saving throw.

4288
02:31:43,142 --> 02:31:45,822
Laura: That's just your flute.

4289
02:31:45,822 --> 02:31:46,969
Sam: Yes.

4290
02:31:46,969 --> 02:31:50,168
Matt: So you lift him up in the air and throw him into that.

4291
02:31:50,168 --> 02:31:52,122
Travis: Strangely aroused by your flute.

4292
02:31:52,122 --> 02:31:54,202
Matt: That ogre is knocked prone by the impact.

4293
02:31:54,202 --> 02:31:55,682
All: Yeah!

4294
02:31:55,682 --> 02:31:57,846
Matt: The other one is also knocked prone.

4295
02:31:57,846 --> 02:31:59,255
(all cheer)

4296
02:31:59,255 --> 02:32:00,606
Matt: Before just (splat noise) into the wall,

4297
02:32:00,606 --> 02:32:02,782
both of them slam to the ground.

4298
02:32:02,782 --> 02:32:04,716
Marisha: With my vines, I make sure my vines really grapple him.

4299
02:32:04,716 --> 02:32:05,762
Orion: I turn to Grog:

4300
02:32:05,762 --> 02:32:07,682
Tiberius: They're all yours buddy!

4301
02:32:07,682 --> 02:32:10,202
Matt: Go ahead and roll 2d6 impact damage for the force of the throw.

4302
02:32:10,202 --> 02:32:11,542
Tiberius: Sweet! Impact damage?

4303
02:32:11,542 --> 02:32:12,922
Orion: Ten.

4304
02:32:12,922 --> 02:32:14,450
Matt: Ten damage to each of them?

4305
02:32:14,450 --> 02:32:16,102
Orion: Yeah.

4306
02:32:16,102 --> 02:32:17,385
Matt: All right. Both of the ogres are now on the ground - (grunts) -

4307
02:32:17,385 --> 02:32:19,216
reeling from the impact.

4308
02:32:19,216 --> 02:32:22,542
That brings us to Grog and Vex going simultaneously.

4309
02:32:22,542 --> 02:32:24,658
Grog: Ladies first.

4310
02:32:24,658 --> 02:32:25,589
Laura: Oh! Well, all right.

4311
02:32:25,589 --> 02:32:28,922
I'm gonna cast Hunter's Mark on the most damaged one.

4312
02:32:28,922 --> 02:32:30,495
Matt: Okay, that'd be this one here.

4313
02:32:30,495 --> 02:32:37,522
Laura: All right. And then I'm going to shoot lightning arrow.

4314
02:32:37,522 --> 02:32:38,665
Matt: All right. Do you want to move a little closer?

4315
02:32:38,665 --> 02:32:40,496
Laura: Yes, I do.

4316
02:32:40,496 --> 02:32:41,582
Matt: All right.

4317
02:32:41,582 --> 02:32:44,362
Matt: So, that would put you right there.

4318
02:32:44,362 --> 02:32:45,468
Laura: All right, cool.

4319
02:32:45,468 --> 02:32:47,842
I'm gonna shoot lightning arrow at them.

4320
02:32:47,842 --> 02:32:50,362
Matt: Okay. So, you pull out your arrow and as you pull it back,

4321
02:32:50,362 --> 02:32:52,262
a little bit of energy courses through your fingers,

4322
02:32:52,262 --> 02:32:54,516
strikes through your arrow.

4323
02:32:54,516 --> 02:32:55,724
You can now see this crackling energy as

4324
02:32:55,724 --> 02:32:57,382
you're pulling it taut in your bow.

4325
02:32:57,382 --> 02:32:59,902
You let it loose. Go ahead and roll for attack.

4326
02:32:59,902 --> 02:33:04,609
Laura: Okay! Twenty one!

4327
02:33:04,609 --> 02:33:06,513
Matt: Twenty one hits.

4328
02:33:06,513 --> 02:33:09,142
Laura: All right. And then I do... something else.

4329
02:33:09,142 --> 02:33:10,820
1d8. Right?

4330
02:33:10,820 --> 02:33:12,122
Matt: Yep. You do the damage of the arrow

4331
02:33:12,122 --> 02:33:13,660
plus the damage of the spell.

4332
02:33:13,660 --> 02:33:17,661
Laura: Holey-moley! So that's this.

4333
02:33:19,719 --> 02:33:26,082
Thirteen for the arrow and then 4d8 for the spell.

4334
02:33:26,082 --> 02:33:33,542
Laura: Eight. Four- twelve. Plus three, fifteen. Seventeen!

4335
02:33:33,542 --> 02:33:37,566
Matt: Seventeen. Okay. The ogre that's been beaten,

4336
02:33:37,566 --> 02:33:40,302
blasted by the fireball, it's getting up - (grunt).

4337
02:33:40,302 --> 02:33:41,979
It grabs its club, and it begins to get up on one leg

4338
02:33:41,979 --> 02:33:43,798
as the lightning arrow slams into its chest.

4339
02:33:43,798 --> 02:33:45,274
You can see it hits.

4340
02:33:45,274 --> 02:33:46,928
Looks down for a second,

4341
02:33:46,928 --> 02:33:48,562
and then the charge pulses through its entire torso.

4342
02:33:48,562 --> 02:33:51,434
As it does, it screams out, "Argh!" into the cavern,

4343
02:33:51,434 --> 02:33:54,310
its whole muscle system locks tight

4344
02:33:54,310 --> 02:33:58,166
and it falls forward again, onto its chest,

4345
02:33:58,166 --> 02:34:00,676
smoke rising off of its whole upper area,

4346
02:34:00,676 --> 02:34:02,142
unmoving, on the ground.

4347
02:34:02,142 --> 02:34:03,382
He is gone.

4348
02:34:03,382 --> 02:34:05,382
Travis: Dang! Come on now!

4349
02:34:05,382 --> 02:34:07,162
Marisha: Fuck him up.

4350
02:34:07,162 --> 02:34:08,862
Laura: Yes! And then the other one takes 2d8

4351
02:34:08,862 --> 02:34:10,163
if he fails his saving throw.

4352
02:34:10,163 --> 02:34:11,707
Matt: Which, with a one, he does.

4353
02:34:11,707 --> 02:34:14,302
Laura: Yes! Oh, he fails it so good.

4354
02:34:14,302 --> 02:34:15,732
(all laugh)

4355
02:34:15,732 --> 02:34:17,762
Matt: So, go ahead a roll damage for other ogre.

4356
02:34:17,762 --> 02:34:19,112
Laura: Two... ten.

4357
02:34:19,112 --> 02:34:22,572
Matt: Ten damage. Nice. So as he falls to the ground, the arc

4358
02:34:22,572 --> 02:34:25,064
arcs over to the other one who drops his club for a second.

4359
02:34:25,064 --> 02:34:28,051
Picks it up angrily.

4360
02:34:28,051 --> 02:34:29,900
Laura: I can reassign my Hunter's Mark to him now?

4361
02:34:29,900 --> 02:34:30,466
Matt: You can.

4362
02:34:30,466 --> 02:34:31,647
Laura: Yes.

4363
02:34:31,647 --> 02:34:33,747
Matt: Yes, all right That brings us to...

4364
02:34:33,747 --> 02:34:35,222
Laura: Oh, my Hunter's Mark!

4365
02:34:35,222 --> 02:34:37,903
I didn't do my Hunter's Mark damage.

4366
02:34:37,903 --> 02:34:38,862
But it doesn't matter. He's dead.

4367
02:34:38,862 --> 02:34:40,082
Matt: It doesn't matter. You killed him.

4368
02:34:40,082 --> 02:34:40,802
Laura: All right, cool.

4369
02:34:40,802 --> 02:34:42,456
(all laugh)

4370
02:34:42,456 --> 02:34:44,519
Matt: So you just ultra killed him!

4371
02:34:44,519 --> 02:34:46,122
(valley girl voice) He is so dead. Oh my god.

4372
02:34:46,122 --> 02:34:47,882
This ogre is done.

4373
02:34:47,882 --> 02:34:49,902
(normal voice) All right. So the other ogre's angry.

4374
02:34:49,902 --> 02:34:51,333
It's now the goblins' turn.

4375
02:34:51,333 --> 02:34:56,438
These goblins rush up. They are just dashing forward.

4376
02:34:56,438 --> 02:34:57,762
Marisha: (valley girl voice) Oh my god, Becky, they are so dead.

4377
02:34:57,762 --> 02:35:01,918
Taliesin: (valley girl voice) They’re just like, dead.

4378
02:35:01,918 --> 02:35:03,744
Matt: This one moves around, and this one runs around to there.

4379
02:35:03,744 --> 02:35:06,251
No attacks.

4380
02:35:06,251 --> 02:35:08,483
Everyone make an insight check.

4381
02:35:08,483 --> 02:35:10,333
Sam: Insight check? Oh shit.

4382
02:35:10,333 --> 02:35:13,129
Marisha: What happened? Why are we doing this?

4383
02:35:13,129 --> 02:35:15,062
Taliesin: I literally get a 1.

4384
02:35:15,062 --> 02:35:18,273
Travis: (sings) Natural 20!

4385
02:35:18,273 --> 02:35:19,802
On an insight check.

4386
02:35:19,802 --> 02:35:21,221
Marisha: 20 total. 20.

4387
02:35:21,221 --> 02:35:22,282
Laura: 22.

4388
02:35:22,282 --> 02:35:23,545
Sam: 4.

4389
02:35:23,545 --> 02:35:24,522
Matt: All right.

4390
02:35:24,522 --> 02:35:25,602
Taliesin: Natural 1.

4391
02:35:25,602 --> 02:35:27,072
I'm really not paying attention.

4392
02:35:27,072 --> 02:35:28,022
Matt: You're dealing with the fact that

4393
02:35:28,022 --> 02:35:29,606
you just fired your gun for the first time

4394
02:35:29,606 --> 02:35:31,222
and it kinda burned your hands a little.

4395
02:35:31,222 --> 02:35:32,222
You're like "Ugh!"

4396
02:35:32,222 --> 02:35:32,902
Sam: Grog.

4397
02:35:32,902 --> 02:35:33,842
Matt: Grog -

4398
02:35:33,842 --> 02:35:35,525
Travis: Recites poetry.

4399
02:35:35,525 --> 02:35:36,192
(all laugh)

4400
02:35:36,192 --> 02:35:37,782
Matt: Grog is familiar with one thing:

4401
02:35:37,782 --> 02:35:39,782
fear in the eyes of his enemies.

4402
02:35:39,782 --> 02:35:42,720
Looking at these goblins, they're not charging to attack.

4403
02:35:42,720 --> 02:35:44,962
The attacks seem to be instinctual.

4404
02:35:44,962 --> 02:35:46,542
They are -

4405
02:35:46,542 --> 02:35:47,237
Marisha: They're running.

4406
02:35:47,237 --> 02:35:47,766
Matt: Running.

4407
02:35:47,766 --> 02:35:49,148
Marisha: Oh no!

4408
02:35:49,148 --> 02:35:50,362
Matt: They are scared.

4409
02:35:50,362 --> 02:35:51,722
Laura: Yes!

4410
02:35:51,722 --> 02:35:52,876
Matt: They are fleeing from something.

4411
02:35:52,876 --> 02:35:54,180
Sam: From the ogres?

4412
02:35:54,180 --> 02:35:56,198
Travis: Something behind the ogres.

4413
02:35:56,198 --> 02:35:58,513
Laura: Oh no.

4414
02:35:58,513 --> 02:36:01,562
Scanlan: May I make a request that you kill them anyway?

4415
02:36:01,562 --> 02:36:05,082
Grog: It's like playing croquet at this point, so yes.

4416
02:36:05,082 --> 02:36:06,782
(all laugh)

4417
02:36:06,782 --> 02:36:07,742
Matt: Grog, it's your turn.

4418
02:36:07,742 --> 02:36:09,222
Grog: I would like to RAGE!

4419
02:36:09,222 --> 02:36:11,395
And I would like to move to the right

4420
02:36:11,395 --> 02:36:13,822
of all those stinking goblins!

4421
02:36:13,822 --> 02:36:14,322
Matt: Right over here?

4422
02:36:14,322 --> 02:36:15,758
Travis: Yeah, a little more to the right,

4423
02:36:15,758 --> 02:36:17,020
yeah a little more,

4424
02:36:17,020 --> 02:36:17,737
yeah keep going,

4425
02:36:17,737 --> 02:36:18,916
all the way flanking it there -

4426
02:36:18,916 --> 02:36:20,811
yeah, yeah.

4427
02:36:20,811 --> 02:36:22,082
Matt: All righty.

4428
02:36:22,082 --> 02:36:23,622
Grog: Yeah, and then I would like to give them

4429
02:36:23,622 --> 02:36:25,750
the cleanest shave possible with my greataxe.

4430
02:36:25,750 --> 02:36:27,682
(all laugh)

4431
02:36:27,682 --> 02:36:29,642
Matt: All right. Go ahead and roll for attack on the first one.

4432
02:36:29,642 --> 02:36:31,609
Laura: Oh yeah, that's a good one!

4433
02:36:31,609 --> 02:36:34,042
Travis: Eighteen plus 8… that's 26?

4434
02:36:34,042 --> 02:36:35,660
Matt: That definitively hits.

4435
02:36:35,660 --> 02:36:36,593
Travis: Word.

4436
02:36:36,593 --> 02:36:37,602
Matt: Go ahead and roll damage.

4437
02:36:37,602 --> 02:36:39,020
Travis: Oh, damage, crap.

4438
02:36:39,020 --> 02:36:40,122
Liam: (sings) Decapitation!

4439
02:36:40,122 --> 02:36:43,307
Travis: 2 plus the 4...

4440
02:36:43,307 --> 02:36:45,742
13!

4441
02:36:45,742 --> 02:36:50,284
Matt: 13? Okay. So, as you rush up, you bring your axe

4442
02:36:50,284 --> 02:36:53,381
into the first goblin to your right - (whoosh) - clean.

4443
02:36:53,381 --> 02:36:53,870
You don't even feel resistance.

4444
02:36:53,870 --> 02:36:55,362
Travis: Hey!

4445
02:36:55,362 --> 02:36:58,021
Matt: You hear this little (wheeze) sound as this being is bisected.

4446
02:36:58,021 --> 02:36:59,422
Grog: Oh, that was cute.

4447
02:36:59,422 --> 02:37:00,987
Matt: Its head and upper torso just rolling off

4448
02:37:00,987 --> 02:37:02,462
to the side before rolling to a stop.

4449
02:37:02,462 --> 02:37:03,770
However, the inertia of your axe still keeps through

4450
02:37:03,770 --> 02:37:05,562
to the one on the other side of you.

4451
02:37:05,562 --> 02:37:06,862
Go ahead and roll for your second attack on that.

4452
02:37:06,862 --> 02:37:09,824
Travis: 21!

4453
02:37:09,824 --> 02:37:12,632
Matt: Also hits, go ahead and roll damage.

4454
02:37:12,632 --> 02:37:17,689
Travis: Oh, that's… was 8 plus 7 is... 15!

4455
02:37:17,689 --> 02:37:20,869
Matt: As you cleave through the first goblin, you swing around,

4456
02:37:20,869 --> 02:37:22,868
another goblin looks up at you, scared,

4457
02:37:22,868 --> 02:37:25,282
and pulls a dagger out with its gnarled tongue, (hisses),

4458
02:37:25,282 --> 02:37:27,142
at which point the ax embeds itself

4459
02:37:27,142 --> 02:37:28,824
straight into its face.

4460
02:37:28,824 --> 02:37:30,842
Its angry face goes, "G-agh!" and

4461
02:37:30,842 --> 02:37:32,562
just falls slack against your blade.

4462
02:37:32,562 --> 02:37:33,415
You lift backward,

4463
02:37:33,415 --> 02:37:34,822
and it's stuck to the edge of your axe.

4464
02:37:34,822 --> 02:37:35,482
(all laugh)

4465
02:37:35,482 --> 02:37:37,082
Matt: Just limply dangling against-

4466
02:37:37,082 --> 02:37:38,682
you shake it off a little bit.

4467
02:37:38,682 --> 02:37:42,202
Grog: Double prizes! Yeah!

4468
02:37:42,202 --> 02:37:44,944
Matt: Great. That ends your turn.

4469
02:37:44,944 --> 02:37:45,722
The thing about Rage is that you can use your bonus action

4470
02:37:45,722 --> 02:37:47,122
for a third attack.

4471
02:37:47,122 --> 02:37:48,483
Travis: No.

4472
02:37:48,483 --> 02:37:48,802
Matt: If you wanted to do a frenzy action,

4473
02:37:48,802 --> 02:37:50,222
but you don't need to.

4474
02:37:50,222 --> 02:37:52,442
That brings us to the ogre's turn.

4475
02:37:52,442 --> 02:37:54,562
The ogre gets up, let's see if it makes

4476
02:37:54,562 --> 02:37:59,116
its saving throw for an attempt to get out.

4477
02:37:59,116 --> 02:38:00,362
It does with an 18.

4478
02:38:00,362 --> 02:38:04,182
However, the ogre - it gets about that far,

4479
02:38:04,182 --> 02:38:09,027
it’s going to make a double move.

4480
02:38:09,027 --> 02:38:10,722
Laura: Double move?!

4481
02:38:10,722 --> 02:38:11,469
Taliesin: He's running.

4482
02:38:11,469 --> 02:38:13,452
Marisha: I still have entangle up.

4483
02:38:13,452 --> 02:38:15,002
Matt: I know. He managed to resist it.

4484
02:38:15,002 --> 02:38:16,282
Laura: He saved against it.

4485
02:38:16,282 --> 02:38:18,315
Travis: He was on the ogre track team in college.

4486
02:38:18,315 --> 02:38:18,662
Matt: It's a big ogre.

4487
02:38:18,662 --> 02:38:20,081
Marisha: Poop.

4488
02:38:20,081 --> 02:38:21,722
Matt: All right, the ogre takes his full turn

4489
02:38:21,722 --> 02:38:23,595
to get up in melee with you guys.

4490
02:38:23,595 --> 02:38:24,842
It does not have its attack since

4491
02:38:24,842 --> 02:38:25,839
it used its full movement there.

4492
02:38:25,839 --> 02:38:27,662
And once again you see as it's lumbering forward,

4493
02:38:27,662 --> 02:38:29,722
it also has this look in its eye of desperation.

4494
02:38:29,722 --> 02:38:31,102
Sam: Oh crap.

4495
02:38:31,102 --> 02:38:33,428
Matt: Now it is Vax's go.

4496
02:38:33,428 --> 02:38:35,842
Liam: My sister's right in the face of the ogre, correct?

4497
02:38:35,842 --> 02:38:36,855
Matt: Correct.

4498
02:38:36,855 --> 02:38:40,039
Liam: Excellent. So, I'm going to take a run towards my sister,

4499
02:38:40,039 --> 02:38:44,057
since she's right close to him, he's distracted,

4500
02:38:44,057 --> 02:38:46,142
so I'm going to turn just as I get to her,

4501
02:38:46,142 --> 02:38:47,862
so my back presses against hers and swing around

4502
02:38:47,862 --> 02:38:50,422
and sneak attack two daggers up in his belly.

4503
02:38:50,422 --> 02:38:52,085
Vex: We've practiced this, I turn.

4504
02:38:52,085 --> 02:38:53,622
(all laugh)

4505
02:38:53,622 --> 02:38:55,135
Matt: All right. So as you dodge to the side

4506
02:38:55,135 --> 02:38:56,242
just this blur of shadow and speed,

4507
02:38:56,242 --> 02:38:57,885
you just coast up to the side of your sister,

4508
02:38:57,885 --> 02:38:59,747
dagger both plunge towards the side

4509
02:38:59,747 --> 02:39:00,945
of the ogre, go ahead roll for an attack.

4510
02:39:00,945 --> 02:39:04,988
Liam: All right. One.

4511
02:39:04,988 --> 02:39:06,962
And then the other one I do a poison dagger,

4512
02:39:06,962 --> 02:39:08,863
gets a (singing) 20!

4513
02:39:08,863 --> 02:39:10,302
Travis: Oh, put it on him brother!

4514
02:39:10,302 --> 02:39:12,182
Matt: All right.

4515
02:39:12,182 --> 02:39:20,102
Liam: That is dagger of venom, 1d4 - 3, plus 2 is 5,

4516
02:39:20,102 --> 02:39:21,862
and then is the sneak attack damage go with - ?

4517
02:39:21,862 --> 02:39:23,412
Matt: Yeah it does because you have another ally adjacent to it.

4518
02:39:23,412 --> 02:39:24,057
Liam: Right, fine.

4519
02:39:24,057 --> 02:39:25,842
Matt: You don't get advantage on the attack roll

4520
02:39:25,842 --> 02:39:27,062
but you can still do the sneak attack.

4521
02:39:27,062 --> 02:39:28,622
Liam: Critical hit, too, as well, wouldn't it?

4522
02:39:28,622 --> 02:39:29,942
Matt: Yeah! You can multiply the sneak attack damage.

4523
02:39:29,942 --> 02:39:32,998
Liam: So 5, plus- and the double goes to the sneak attack damage?

4524
02:39:32,998 --> 02:39:35,934
Matt: It does. Modifiers don't double,

4525
02:39:35,934 --> 02:39:38,162
but any dice you roll double.

4526
02:39:38,162 --> 02:39:40,182
Liam: 9, 15...

4527
02:39:41,242 --> 02:39:42,542
Matt: In my game.

4528
02:39:42,542 --> 02:39:43,682
(clicks tongue)

4529
02:39:43,682 --> 02:39:45,162
Liam: So 30 plus, uh, 5, 35.

4530
02:39:45,162 --> 02:39:46,462
Travis: Damn!

4531
02:39:46,462 --> 02:39:47,362
Matt: 35 damage.

4532
02:39:47,362 --> 02:39:48,403
Orion: Yeah!

4533
02:39:48,403 --> 02:39:49,571
Liam: Plus poison.

4534
02:39:49,571 --> 02:39:50,886
Matt: The poison's not going to factor in.

4535
02:39:50,886 --> 02:39:51,665
Liam: Okay.

4536
02:39:51,665 --> 02:39:53,202
Matt: You swing past her, both blades

4537
02:39:53,202 --> 02:39:54,337
jam right into the side of its rib cage.

4538
02:39:54,337 --> 02:39:56,218
You hear it howl out in pain.

4539
02:39:56,218 --> 02:39:59,022
As it does, you twist the daggers

4540
02:39:59,022 --> 02:40:01,077
in a way where both blades are now

4541
02:40:01,077 --> 02:40:02,254
going in two different directions,

4542
02:40:02,254 --> 02:40:04,950
and you carve out a section of its entire abdomen.

4543
02:40:04,950 --> 02:40:06,342
All: Ugh!

4544
02:40:06,342 --> 02:40:08,009
Matt : As you do, the flesh, almost like whale blubber,

4545
02:40:08,009 --> 02:40:09,936
just - (splat) - sloughs off the sides of it.

4546
02:40:09,936 --> 02:40:11,882
Organs spill out, intestines, and it kinda looks down

4547
02:40:11,882 --> 02:40:13,662
and tries to pull them back in.

4548
02:40:13,662 --> 02:40:15,727
(panicked groaning)

4549
02:40:15,727 --> 02:40:18,227
At which point you see the color draining from its face,

4550
02:40:18,227 --> 02:40:20,362
and you just kinda lean up and kick it down.

4551
02:40:20,362 --> 02:40:23,957
The ogre - (groans) - and falls to the ground lifeless...

4552
02:40:23,957 --> 02:40:24,882
destroyed.

4553
02:40:24,882 --> 02:40:28,222
(all laugh and cheer)

4554
02:40:28,222 --> 02:40:29,174
Taliesin: You gave him just enough time to regret

4555
02:40:29,174 --> 02:40:30,302
everything that had ever happened.

4556
02:40:30,302 --> 02:40:31,002
Matt: Yes.

4557
02:40:31,002 --> 02:40:32,422
Taliesin: Well done... bad life choices.

4558
02:40:32,422 --> 02:40:33,861
Matt: That brings us to Keyleth.

4559
02:40:33,861 --> 02:40:35,742
Marisha: (as the ogre) I didn’t call mom enough.

4560
02:40:35,742 --> 02:40:37,290
I should’ve called mom.

4561
02:40:37,290 --> 02:40:38,951
Matt: There are two goblins left.

4562
02:40:38,951 --> 02:40:45,142
Marisha: Okay. I do a quick sprint jog up kinda up towards Grog

4563
02:40:45,142 --> 02:40:49,585
and go (boof) and bring up a big stone wall.

4564
02:40:49,585 --> 02:40:51,734
Right where that entrance is.

4565
02:40:51,734 --> 02:40:53,202
Matt: Right here?

4566
02:40:53,202 --> 02:40:55,302
Marisha: No. Like, right where things are pouring out.

4567
02:40:55,302 --> 02:40:55,802
Matt: Right, here?

4568
02:40:55,802 --> 02:40:56,899
Marisha: Yeah.

4569
02:40:56,899 --> 02:40:57,862
Matt: All right, Wall of Stone.

4570
02:40:57,862 --> 02:40:59,442
Marisha: Wall of Stone... boom.

4571
02:40:59,442 --> 02:41:01,422
Matt: All right.

4572
02:41:01,422 --> 02:41:04,062
A giant wall of stone now completely seals off

4573
02:41:04,062 --> 02:41:05,242
that part of the mine.

4574
02:41:05,242 --> 02:41:05,983
Tiberius: You closed it off?

4575
02:41:05,983 --> 02:41:07,122
Keyleth: I closed it off.

4576
02:41:07,122 --> 02:41:08,382
We don't know what’s in there,

4577
02:41:08,382 --> 02:41:09,922
we should talk about this for a second,

4578
02:41:09,922 --> 02:41:11,238
and I bought us some time.

4579
02:41:11,238 --> 02:41:12,179
I'm sure it’s going to try to beat

4580
02:41:12,179 --> 02:41:13,562
through that door in a  second.

4581
02:41:13,562 --> 02:41:15,082
Matt: I'm going to say that you moved

4582
02:41:15,082 --> 02:41:16,560
up to there with your movement.

4583
02:41:16,560 --> 02:41:19,082
All right, I’d say probably over here,

4584
02:41:19,082 --> 02:41:20,842
not right next to the goblins and

4585
02:41:20,842 --> 02:41:21,946
that will give you enough range.

4586
02:41:21,946 --> 02:41:23,498
Okay, so the all of stone - (boom)

4587
02:41:23,498 --> 02:41:24,782
Marisha: Are there any guards around still?

4588
02:41:24,782 --> 02:41:26,590
Any dwarven guards.

4589
02:41:26,590 --> 02:41:28,403
Matt: They are all just watching you do this now.

4590
02:41:28,403 --> 02:41:30,940
They don't want to put their lives at risk,

4591
02:41:30,940 --> 02:41:33,142
and you guys seem intent on getting into the middle of this battle,

4592
02:41:33,142 --> 02:41:34,422
so they are just going to sit back and let you do it.

4593
02:41:34,422 --> 02:41:36,122
Marisha: I throw up my wall and turn around and I say:

4594
02:41:36,122 --> 02:41:38,442
Keyleth: What’s coming?!

4595
02:41:38,442 --> 02:41:40,113
Tell us! You know what’s coming!

4596
02:41:40,113 --> 02:41:41,905
What’s coming!?

4597
02:41:41,905 --> 02:41:43,382
Matt: Make an intimidation check.

4598
02:41:43,382 --> 02:41:46,382
Laura: Keyleth, you are so hard core.

4599
02:41:46,382 --> 02:41:47,601
Marisha: I'm not good at this.

4600
02:41:47,601 --> 02:41:48,828
Sam: You speak goblin?

4601
02:41:48,828 --> 02:41:50,674
Marisha: [sadly] Oh, four.

4602
02:41:50,674 --> 02:41:52,510
(all laugh and groan)

4603
02:41:52,510 --> 02:41:57,442
Taliesin: Make a pity roll.

4604
02:41:57,442 --> 02:41:59,782
Matt: A very gentle attempt at intimidation,

4605
02:41:59,782 --> 02:42:01,122
however, the message gets across.

4606
02:42:01,122 --> 02:42:04,336
The guards look at you, taken off guard.

4607
02:42:04,336 --> 02:42:06,273
Keyleth: We are about to die.

4608
02:42:06,273 --> 02:42:08,438
It is in your best interest to tell us.

4609
02:42:08,438 --> 02:42:11,793
Guards: We don't know! It’s been different things.

4610
02:42:11,793 --> 02:42:12,824
Strange abominations.

4611
02:42:12,824 --> 02:42:14,267
It’s hard to describe. They’re -

4612
02:42:14,267 --> 02:42:15,382
- put together.

4613
02:42:15,382 --> 02:42:18,076
Something’s making things down there.

4614
02:42:18,076 --> 02:42:21,882
Keyleth: What kind of things? From where?

4615
02:42:21,882 --> 02:42:25,582
Matt: As they’re talking you hear a (boom) against the stone.

4616
02:42:25,582 --> 02:42:32,062
Travis: I bring out my blade.

4617
02:42:32,062 --> 02:42:34,195
Matt: So, the stone cracks, and you can see a noticeable crack

4618
02:42:34,195 --> 02:42:36,048
and an audible - (cracking noise).

4619
02:42:36,048 --> 02:42:39,642
Liam: I'm running right now diagonally towards the wall

4620
02:42:39,642 --> 02:42:40,902
and I press against the wall.

4621
02:42:40,902 --> 02:42:42,031
Laura: Oh, good call.

4622
02:42:42,031 --> 02:42:44,042
I do the same thing on the other side.

4623
02:42:44,042 --> 02:42:45,398
Matt: Okay, so you come over here,

4624
02:42:45,398 --> 02:42:46,142
do you want to bring Trinket with you?

4625
02:42:46,142 --> 02:42:47,386
Laura: Yeah!

4626
02:42:47,386 --> 02:42:47,902
Matt: All right.

4627
02:42:47,902 --> 02:42:49,314
Taliesin: You're all so fancy.

4628
02:42:49,314 --> 02:42:50,691
Marisha: I cast Stoneskin on myself.

4629
02:42:50,691 --> 02:42:51,852
Vex: I’m stealthing, I’m stealthing.

4630
02:42:51,852 --> 02:42:53,482
Matt: Roll stealth both of you.

4631
02:42:53,482 --> 02:42:55,342
Orion: How tall are the walls? I mean the ceiling.

4632
02:42:55,342 --> 02:42:56,602
Mat: Oh, the ceiling right now is

4633
02:42:56,602 --> 02:42:59,305
the rest of Kraghammer for the most part.

4634
02:42:59,305 --> 02:43:00,617
Travis: Hundreds, hundreds.

4635
02:43:00,617 --> 02:43:02,942
Matt: Yeah, it is a huge ceiling.

4636
02:43:02,942 --> 02:43:04,808
Orion: I get within casting range.

4637
02:43:04,808 --> 02:43:06,622
Travis: What’s in the middle? Are those fires?

4638
02:43:06,622 --> 02:43:07,974
Matt: These are braziers here.

4639
02:43:07,974 --> 02:43:11,702
By the way, Stoneskin goes, this disappears.

4640
02:43:11,702 --> 02:43:13,298
Travis: The entanglement?

4641
02:43:13,298 --> 02:43:14,995
Matt: Yeah, the entanglement is gone.

4642
02:43:14,995 --> 02:43:15,882
But there are minecarts, some rocks,

4643
02:43:15,882 --> 02:43:17,062
there is a smashed cart over here

4644
02:43:17,062 --> 02:43:18,302
from when the ogre barreled through.

4645
02:43:18,302 --> 02:43:19,362
This is just a piece of stone

4646
02:43:19,362 --> 02:43:21,409
that rises about 15 feet,

4647
02:43:21,409 --> 02:43:22,693
and these are both braziers

4648
02:43:22,693 --> 02:43:23,863
for light in the center of the area.

4649
02:43:23,863 --> 02:43:25,588
So - it’s hundreds and hundreds of feet up.

4650
02:43:25,588 --> 02:43:30,763
You can look up to the very top of Kraghammer from here.

4651
02:43:30,763 --> 02:43:34,602
Orion: Okay, that’s fine.

4652
02:43:34,602 --> 02:43:36,726
Matt; So whatcha got?

4653
02:43:36,726 --> 02:43:38,313
Well, let’s see. So Keyleth.

4654
02:43:38,313 --> 02:43:39,542
That is your turn, Stoneskin and moving up.

4655
02:43:39,542 --> 02:43:40,922
So, anywhere else you want to go?

4656
02:43:40,922 --> 02:43:43,111
I mean, technically, right now we are not in combat.

4657
02:43:43,111 --> 02:43:44,102
Sam: Right. We are out of combat.

4658
02:43:44,102 --> 02:43:45,407
Matt: Briefly.

4659
02:43:45,407 --> 02:43:48,129
Travis: Yeah, we are waiting for the homecoming dance to start.

4660
02:43:48,129 --> 02:43:50,042
Taliesin: I'm breathing, taking aim at the wall,

4661
02:43:50,042 --> 02:43:51,981
just resetting everything.

4662
02:43:51,981 --> 02:43:53,658
Marisha: Can I move up behind that pillar?

4663
02:43:53,658 --> 02:43:55,582
Matt: Okay.

4664
02:43:55,582 --> 02:43:57,722
Taliesin: I'm staying far back at the moment.

4665
02:43:57,722 --> 02:43:59,102
Matt: So, back here.

4666
02:43:59,102 --> 02:44:01,760
Matt: Both of these goblins...

4667
02:44:01,760 --> 02:44:03,034
I'll just say that you guys end up taking them down.

4668
02:44:03,034 --> 02:44:04,491
It’s not even a question.

4669
02:44:04,491 --> 02:44:07,341
You step on them and crush them.

4670
02:44:07,341 --> 02:44:08,755
Travis: Are there any dwarves that we can say,

4671
02:44:08,755 --> 02:44:10,181
“Go get Ballsack and bring him down?”

4672
02:44:10,181 --> 02:44:11,781
(all laugh)

4673
02:44:11,781 --> 02:44:13,062
Matt: You can.

4674
02:44:13,062 --> 02:44:14,248
Laura: Oh yeah, Balgoos! Balgus.

4675
02:44:14,248 --> 02:44:15,545
Matt: Balgus? You just tell them,

4676
02:44:15,545 --> 02:44:17,799
"Get Balgus!" and they are like... "Who?"

4677
02:44:17,799 --> 02:44:19,275
Liam: Grab Ballsack!

4678
02:44:19,275 --> 02:44:20,935
Matt: Some of them have set crossbows up by the way.

4679
02:44:20,935 --> 02:44:22,742
They’re barreling down to get ready to fire

4680
02:44:22,742 --> 02:44:24,062
at whatever comes through.

4681
02:44:24,062 --> 02:44:26,312
BOOF! Another crack in the wall.

4682
02:44:26,312 --> 02:44:27,369
You can see the dust settle as the stone

4683
02:44:27,369 --> 02:44:30,102
cracks again and a large piece at the top tumbles off.

4684
02:44:30,102 --> 02:44:33,162
The stone wall’s probably not going to hold another impact.

4685
02:44:33,162 --> 02:44:34,702
Anybody else want to move anywhere?

4686
02:44:34,702 --> 02:44:36,562
Taliesin: Just taking aim.

4687
02:44:36,562 --> 02:44:39,425
Sam: I'll move up to the right near where Grog is.

4688
02:44:39,425 --> 02:44:43,622
And nobody has taken any damage yet, right?

4689
02:44:43,622 --> 02:44:44,442
All: No.

4690
02:44:44,442 --> 02:44:46,082
Matt: Not currently, no.

4691
02:44:46,082 --> 02:44:46,882
You guys have had a pretty clean sweep

4692
02:44:46,882 --> 02:44:48,786
into this battle, so far.

4693
02:44:48,786 --> 02:44:50,702
Sam: I can't inspire anybody here? Now?

4694
02:44:50,702 --> 02:44:51,785
Matt: You can inspire anybody.

4695
02:44:51,785 --> 02:44:53,322
Just give them a dice.

4696
02:44:53,322 --> 02:44:54,602
Sam: Can I inspire everyone?

4697
02:44:54,602 --> 02:44:55,522
Matt: You can spend all your uses to inspire as many people

4698
02:44:55,522 --> 02:44:57,563
as you have the uses of it.

4699
02:44:57,563 --> 02:45:00,181
Marisha: I still have mine that I haven't used yet.

4700
02:45:00,181 --> 02:45:03,832
Sam: I'll inspire Vex and Vax and Grog.

4701
02:45:03,832 --> 02:45:05,402
Matt: So, mark that you guys all have a d8 to expend on an

4702
02:45:05,402 --> 02:45:06,802
attack roll, or a saving throw.

4703
02:45:06,802 --> 02:45:09,123
Scanlan: (singing) I think you're really handsome and nice!

4704
02:45:09,123 --> 02:45:12,646
You're going to have inspiration dice!

4705
02:45:12,646 --> 02:45:14,922
(all laugh)

4706
02:45:14,922 --> 02:45:16,768
Travis: Thought you were gonna have a little -

4707
02:45:16,768 --> 02:45:18,538
Laura: I know, some beautiful song for us!

4708
02:45:18,538 --> 02:45:20,983
Wait, what for all of us? We all get a d8?

4709
02:45:20,983 --> 02:45:24,337
Matt: Each of you has to have a single d8 dice, inspiration dice.

4710
02:45:24,337 --> 02:45:26,120
The bardic inspiration is flowing through you

4711
02:45:26,120 --> 02:45:29,136
that you can use to add to an attack roll, not damage.

4712
02:45:29,136 --> 02:45:30,302
You can add it to an attack roll, a saving throw -

4713
02:45:30,302 --> 02:45:33,467
Scanlan: (plays tune on electric piano app)

4714
02:45:33,467 --> 02:45:35,339
(all laugh)

4715
02:45:35,339 --> 02:45:38,682
Matt: There you go. That’s what a shawm sounds like, apparently.

4716
02:45:38,682 --> 02:45:39,722
So you can use it on attack throw, a saving throw,

4717
02:45:39,722 --> 02:45:42,662
or an ability check. Any skill.

4718
02:45:42,662 --> 02:45:46,082
Tiberius, are you going to stay where you are,

4719
02:45:46,082 --> 02:45:47,397
are you moving anywhere?

4720
02:45:47,397 --> 02:45:48,647
Last chance.

4721
02:45:48,647 --> 02:45:49,922
Orion: Is that cover right there next to me?

4722
02:45:49,922 --> 02:45:51,150
Matt: Right over here? Yeah.

4723
02:45:51,150 --> 02:45:52,622
Orion: I'll get behind the cover.

4724
02:45:52,622 --> 02:45:53,802
Matt: Okay.

4725
02:45:53,802 --> 02:45:55,189
Orion: And I’m going to peek out and I'm gonna cast Blur.

4726
02:45:55,189 --> 02:45:56,742
Matt: Okay, Stoneskin goes away.

4727
02:45:56,742 --> 02:45:58,382
Orion: I can't do both?

4728
02:45:58,382 --> 02:46:00,542
Matt: Nope. They're both concentration spells.

4729
02:46:00,542 --> 02:46:02,189
Orion: Okay, I leave Stoneskin.

4730
02:46:02,189 --> 02:46:06,040
Matt: Okay, Stoneskin stays on.

4731
02:46:06,040 --> 02:46:08,602
At which point - (boom) - the stone breaks through

4732
02:46:08,602 --> 02:46:10,513
scattering across the ground.

4733
02:46:10,513 --> 02:46:13,102
You see immediately bursting through -

4734
02:46:13,102 --> 02:46:14,753
Travis: What the fuck is that?

4735
02:46:14,753 --> 02:46:16,192
Laura: What is it?

4736
02:46:16,192 --> 02:46:18,290
Matt: A bulbous, oversized, naga-like creature.

4737
02:46:18,290 --> 02:46:21,753
You've encountered a naga before, which is a large serpentine

4738
02:46:21,753 --> 02:46:24,009
creature with a humanoid head.

4739
02:46:24,009 --> 02:46:27,262
However, this one is swollen, it is bulbous.

4740
02:46:27,262 --> 02:46:29,302
The way it moves looks unnatural

4741
02:46:29,302 --> 02:46:32,115
and it has affixed to it not one,

4742
02:46:32,115 --> 02:46:35,282
not three, but five other different colored naga heads

4743
02:46:35,282 --> 02:46:37,662
that look to be stitched to its body.

4744
02:46:37,662 --> 02:46:38,502
Laura: Gross!

4745
02:46:38,502 --> 02:46:40,822
Matt: It is a seriously terrible abomination.

4746
02:46:40,822 --> 02:46:42,142
And as it just breaks through the stone -

4747
02:46:42,142 --> 02:46:44,612
(hisses and growls)

4748
02:46:44,612 --> 02:46:46,122
- all the heads rear back.

4749
02:46:46,122 --> 02:46:47,682
Marisha: Do naga heads do something if you look at them?

4750
02:46:47,682 --> 02:46:49,086
Matt: We're beginning back at the top of the initiative order.

4751
02:46:49,086 --> 02:46:50,302
Travis: Oh shit!

4752
02:46:50,302 --> 02:46:52,783
Laura: Wait wait wait! I got a question!

4753
02:46:52,783 --> 02:46:54,012
My Hunter's Mark, can I transfer it

4754
02:46:54,012 --> 02:46:55,283
to that thing or do I have to -

4755
02:46:55,283 --> 02:46:56,702
Matt: Correct, you can, yes.

4756
02:46:56,702 --> 02:46:57,502
Laura: Yes!

4757
02:46:57,502 --> 02:46:58,862
Matt: Because this still part of the encounter which that.

4758
02:46:58,862 --> 02:47:00,342
Laura: (Sings.) Sweet!

4759
02:47:00,342 --> 02:47:01,490
Matt: So that is now marked with the hunter's mark.

4760
02:47:01,490 --> 02:47:02,982
Percy, you're up first.

4761
02:47:02,982 --> 02:47:03,842
Taliesin: Do I have to take new aim or

4762
02:47:03,842 --> 02:47:05,956
can I have myself already trained on -

4763
02:47:05,956 --> 02:47:06,982
Matt: You've had a moment to train.

4764
02:47:06,982 --> 02:47:08,685
You haven't seen the creature until it just burst out

4765
02:47:08,685 --> 02:47:10,040
so it would take you a round to aim.

4766
02:47:10,040 --> 02:47:11,385
Taliesin: I'm taking my round to aim.

4767
02:47:11,385 --> 02:47:12,642
Matt: Okay, so you're aiming.

4768
02:47:12,642 --> 02:47:16,713
That brings us to Tiberius.

4769
02:47:16,713 --> 02:47:18,582
Orion: What did you just-

4770
02:47:18,582 --> 02:47:20,742
Taliesin: I just took aim. Took aim.

4771
02:47:20,742 --> 02:47:22,903
Just a gun.

4772
02:47:22,903 --> 02:47:27,122
Marisha: "Just" a gun.

4773
02:47:27,122 --> 02:47:28,882
Taliesin: This gun doesn't do anything fancy.

4774
02:47:28,882 --> 02:47:30,790
Just shoots really far, really hard.

4775
02:47:30,790 --> 02:47:35,662
Orion: Okay! I'll do a... Scorching Ray.

4776
02:47:35,662 --> 02:47:37,780
Matt: Scorching Ray, all right.

4777
02:47:37,780 --> 02:47:38,702
It makes a saving throw -

4778
02:47:38,702 --> 02:47:39,842
It does not!

4779
02:47:39,842 --> 02:47:42,798
Rolled a 2, so full damage on it.

4780
02:47:42,798 --> 02:47:46,958
Orion: So two for four... let's shoot two of them right now,

4781
02:47:46,958 --> 02:47:48,770
right, three of them?

4782
02:47:48,770 --> 02:47:49,955
Matt: It's an aimed ray attack?

4783
02:47:49,955 --> 02:47:51,102
Orion: Yeah.

4784
02:47:51,102 --> 02:47:52,182
Matt: Then you have to roll for the attack.

4785
02:47:52,182 --> 02:47:54,902
So, roll a d20 and add your -

4786
02:47:54,902 --> 02:47:56,842
Travis: Roll high, roll high.

4787
02:47:56,842 --> 02:47:59,275
Matt: Top of your spell page.

4788
02:47:59,275 --> 02:48:00,567
Laura: Big roll, big roll, big roll.

4789
02:48:00,567 --> 02:48:02,061
Matt: Top of your spell page.

4790
02:48:02,061 --> 02:48:04,837
Orion: Oh! That's 23.

4791
02:48:04,837 --> 02:48:06,102
Matt: 23? 23 hits.

4792
02:48:06,102 --> 02:48:07,300
Orion: Yes, okay.

4793
02:48:07,300 --> 02:48:08,857
Matt: All right.

4794
02:48:08,857 --> 02:48:10,504
Orion: And then that's two d6… that's 12.

4795
02:48:10,504 --> 02:48:11,773
Matt: Twelve points of damage to the naga.

4796
02:48:11,773 --> 02:48:15,259
All right. That brings us to -

4797
02:48:15,259 --> 02:48:17,351
Orion: Wait. I roll for the second shot, right?

4798
02:48:17,351 --> 02:48:19,122
Matt: Yeah.

4799
02:48:19,122 --> 02:48:20,682
Orion: Okay, and that's a natural 20.

4800
02:48:20,682 --> 02:48:22,085
(all cheer)

4801
02:48:22,085 --> 02:48:24,389
Matt: Okay.

4802
02:48:24,389 --> 02:48:25,516
Okay, so you fire one beam off - (exploding sound) -

4803
02:48:25,516 --> 02:48:26,862
and it slams into the side of one of the naga heads.

4804
02:48:26,862 --> 02:48:28,362
The second you bring back and as you do there's a

4805
02:48:28,362 --> 02:48:30,122
flicker of arcane instability.

4806
02:48:30,122 --> 02:48:32,762
His arm shakes as he releases the surge of scorching

4807
02:48:32,762 --> 02:48:34,994
energy as it blasts into the side of the naga.

4808
02:48:34,994 --> 02:48:37,242
Also does not make a saving throw again!

4809
02:48:37,242 --> 02:48:38,277
Roll full damage.

4810
02:48:38,277 --> 02:48:40,862
Travis: Holy shit, Tiberius.

4811
02:48:40,862 --> 02:48:42,182
Taliesin: Oh my god.

4812
02:48:42,182 --> 02:48:43,031
Orion: Twelve.

4813
02:48:43,031 --> 02:48:43,709
Matt: Twelve?

4814
02:48:43,709 --> 02:48:44,462
Orion: Yeah.

4815
02:48:44,462 --> 02:48:46,298
Matt: Multiplied? Or did you roll a 12?

4816
02:48:46,298 --> 02:48:47,242
Orion: I rolled a 12.

4817
02:48:47,242 --> 02:48:48,362
Matt: Twelve. Times two. 24 points of damage.

4818
02:48:48,362 --> 02:48:51,387
Orion: Oh! I'm terrible at math!

4819
02:48:51,387 --> 02:48:52,622
Stay in school, kids!

4820
02:48:52,622 --> 02:48:54,184
(all laugh)

4821
02:48:54,184 --> 02:48:55,522
Matt: All right, so it just blasts into

4822
02:48:55,522 --> 02:48:56,589
the side of the naga heads.

4823
02:48:56,589 --> 02:48:58,742
Marisha: This is a good time to note our charity, 826 LA.

4824
02:48:58,742 --> 02:48:59,586
Sam: Not yet. Don't donate yet.

4825
02:48:59,586 --> 02:49:01,142
Sam: Donate next week.

4826
02:49:01,142 --> 02:49:05,581
Matt: Next week, there's things that you can donate to then.

4827
02:49:05,581 --> 02:49:07,662
All right, so that brings us to the end of Tiberius' turn.

4828
02:49:07,662 --> 02:49:09,042
You want to move at all, are you staying where you are?

4829
02:49:09,042 --> 02:49:10,237
Tiberius: I’ll stay right here.

4830
02:49:10,237 --> 02:49:11,579
Matt: All right Grog's up next, you're up.

4831
02:49:11,579 --> 02:49:12,602
Travis: Ladies first.

4832
02:49:12,602 --> 02:49:14,382
Laura: Oh! Oh! Me! Okay, I'm gonna shoot -

4833
02:49:14,382 --> 02:49:19,137
oh God, I didn't realise I was going so fast.

4834
02:49:19,137 --> 02:49:20,162
Matt: What did you roll for stealth by the way?

4835
02:49:20,162 --> 02:49:21,342
Laura: What?

4836
02:49:21,342 --> 02:49:23,602
Matt: What did you roll for stealth by the way?

4837
02:49:23,602 --> 02:49:25,280
Laura: I rolled a 20 for stealth!

4838
02:49:25,280 --> 02:49:26,582
Matt: Then yeah, he has no idea you're there.

4839
02:49:26,582 --> 02:49:27,656
Laura: Sweet!

4840
02:49:27,656 --> 02:49:30,142
Matt: He just sees the bear going - (bear growl)

4841
02:49:30,142 --> 02:49:33,219
Laura: Okay. Trinket's gonna hang out because

4842
02:49:33,219 --> 02:49:35,482
I don't want to - you know.

4843
02:49:35,482 --> 02:49:38,222
I'm going to shoot Conjure Barrage -

4844
02:49:38,222 --> 02:49:41,102
No, I'm just going to  shoot him twice.

4845
02:49:41,102 --> 02:49:42,423
Matt: All right, go for it!

4846
02:49:42,423 --> 02:49:43,142
Laura: All right.

4847
02:49:43,142 --> 02:49:44,273
Matt: Arrow once, arrow twice -

4848
02:49:44,273 --> 02:49:45,402
(arrow noises)

4849
02:49:45,402 --> 02:49:46,809
- Legolas style.

4850
02:49:46,809 --> 02:49:50,259
Laura: I am going to do the fire arrow thingy at it.

4851
02:49:50,259 --> 02:49:52,922
Matt: Okay, so using your bowstring.

4852
02:49:52,922 --> 02:49:55,102
Laura: The blazing bowstring, thank you Tiberius!

4853
02:49:55,102 --> 02:49:56,292
Matt: That he created and crafted!

4854
02:49:56,292 --> 02:49:59,032
All right so as you pull the second arrow out you nock it.

4855
02:49:59,032 --> 02:50:00,745
As you let it go it bursts into flames

4856
02:50:00,745 --> 02:50:02,182
arcing halfway through the air.

4857
02:50:02,182 --> 02:50:03,583
Laura: Okay.

4858
02:50:03,583 --> 02:50:04,862
Matt: What was your to hit roll on that?

4859
02:50:04,862 --> 02:50:05,542
Laura: 21?

4860
02:50:05,542 --> 02:50:06,042
Matt: 21 hits!

4861
02:50:06,042 --> 02:50:07,582
Laura: Okay.

4862
02:50:07,582 --> 02:50:09,021
Oh wait, that's a -

4863
02:50:09,021 --> 02:50:12,202
4 plus 7 is 11.

4864
02:50:12,202 --> 02:50:13,838
Sam: Don't forget your inspiration!

4865
02:50:13,838 --> 02:50:14,742
Matt: Well inspiration dice is to hit.

4866
02:50:14,742 --> 02:50:16,242
Sam: Oh, okay.

4867
02:50:16,242 --> 02:50:16,822
Laura: 11.

4868
02:50:16,822 --> 02:50:17,802
Matt: So, 11 points of damage.

4869
02:50:17,802 --> 02:50:19,928
Laura: For the first one, plus for the blazing bowstring

4870
02:50:19,928 --> 02:50:24,662
I can turn any arrow into a flaming arrow,

4871
02:50:24,662 --> 02:50:27,082
doing additional 10 fire damage.

4872
02:50:27,082 --> 02:50:28,525
Matt: Awesome.

4873
02:50:28,525 --> 02:50:29,622
Laura: So I'll roll that right now.

4874
02:50:29,622 --> 02:50:30,522
Matt: There you go.

4875
02:50:30,522 --> 02:50:32,802
Laura: Which is this. Which is a 7!

4876
02:50:32,802 --> 02:50:34,682
Matt: So an additional 7, so 18 total damage and that arrow -

4877
02:50:34,682 --> 02:50:36,159
(impact sound)

4878
02:50:36,159 --> 02:50:38,153
in the side of its body.

4879
02:50:38,153 --> 02:50:40,162
One of the serpent heads reels back from the pain.

4880
02:50:40,162 --> 02:50:41,459
Laura: Yeah! Screw you, Naga!

4881
02:50:41,459 --> 02:50:42,604
Matt: It begins snatching at where the arrow's now protruding from it,

4882
02:50:42,604 --> 02:50:43,695
trying to break it off.

4883
02:50:43,695 --> 02:50:46,542
Laura: And then I'm gonna roll again!

4884
02:50:46,542 --> 02:50:48,362
That's a 24!

4885
02:50:48,362 --> 02:50:49,302
Matt: That hits, go ahead and roll damage.

4886
02:50:49,302 --> 02:50:50,853
Laura: Awesome. That's an 8.

4887
02:50:50,853 --> 02:50:52,372
Matt: Grog, you're on deck.

4888
02:50:52,372 --> 02:50:53,816
Grog: I'm ready!

4889
02:50:53,816 --> 02:50:55,102
Laura: 7 plus 7 is 14!

4890
02:50:55,102 --> 02:50:56,800
Matt: 14 damage, all right. Both arrows -

4891
02:50:56,800 --> 02:50:57,782
(arrow impact sounds)

4892
02:50:57,782 --> 02:51:00,444
- sink into it. Definitely piercing through the scales a little bit,

4893
02:51:00,444 --> 02:51:02,011
but not sticking too deeply into its body;

4894
02:51:02,011 --> 02:51:03,622
it's definitely a hearty creature.

4895
02:51:03,622 --> 02:51:04,482
Grog, you're up!

4896
02:51:04,482 --> 02:51:06,982
Grog: Right, I would like to run around the other side of the rock,

4897
02:51:06,982 --> 02:51:11,382
raging, spit flying out my of my mouth!

4898
02:51:11,382 --> 02:51:12,769
And I would like to use the Chain of Returning,

4899
02:51:12,769 --> 02:51:14,239
also crafted by Tiberius,

4900
02:51:14,239 --> 02:51:15,502
attach it to the end of the great axe,

4901
02:51:15,502 --> 02:51:18,636
and throw it, from where I am, at the snake.

4902
02:51:18,636 --> 02:51:19,764
Matt: Okay.

4903
02:51:19,764 --> 02:51:20,830
Tiberius: Yeah!

4904
02:51:20,830 --> 02:51:22,542
Matt: He comes running around, rears back,

4905
02:51:22,542 --> 02:51:26,082
and takes his double-handed great axe and just lobs it overhand.

4906
02:51:26,082 --> 02:51:27,802
The chain, that's wrapped around your wrist,

4907
02:51:27,802 --> 02:51:30,082
keeping it attached to you, in some degree.

4908
02:51:30,082 --> 02:51:31,894
Go ahead and roll for the attack.

4909
02:51:31,894 --> 02:51:33,211
Travis: 8, 9, uh, 17!

4910
02:51:33,211 --> 02:51:34,828
Matt: 17?

4911
02:51:34,828 --> 02:51:36,441
It just hits!

4912
02:51:36,441 --> 02:51:40,961
Travis: All right, nice. That is... 15.

4913
02:51:40,961 --> 02:51:43,222
Matt: 15 points of damage.

4914
02:51:43,222 --> 02:51:47,382
As the axe embeds itself pretty deeply into the torso.

4915
02:51:47,382 --> 02:51:49,022
Laura: Oh! I didn't do my Hunter's Mark.

4916
02:51:49,022 --> 02:51:50,259
Matt: Roll Hunter's Mark damage right now.

4917
02:51:50,259 --> 02:51:52,038
Laura: Thank you. Thank you, chatroom!

4918
02:51:52,038 --> 02:51:54,102
(all laugh)

4919
02:51:54,102 --> 02:51:55,185
Laura: 6!

4920
02:51:55,185 --> 02:51:56,902
Matt: 6? Awesome. 6 damage. All right.

4921
02:51:56,902 --> 02:51:58,712
Travis: This says, 'An athletics-strength check is required

4922
02:51:58,712 --> 02:52:00,315
to pull the weapon free, the DC12?'

4923
02:52:00,315 --> 02:52:03,452
Matt: So, go ahead and roll an athletics check.

4924
02:52:03,452 --> 02:52:05,482
Travis: 12.

4925
02:52:05,482 --> 02:52:06,682
Matt: Roll a d20.

4926
02:52:06,682 --> 02:52:08,228
Travis: Oh, a d20.

4927
02:52:08,228 --> 02:52:09,502
Matt: It's a DC12.

4928
02:52:09,502 --> 02:52:13,216
Travis: Shit. Balls. Taint. 5.

4929
02:52:13,216 --> 02:52:14,522
Matt: Plus...

4930
02:52:14,522 --> 02:52:15,731
Travis: Plus what? Plus-

4931
02:52:15,731 --> 02:52:17,318
Matt: Plus your athletics!

4932
02:52:17,318 --> 02:52:21,154
Travis: Oh! Oh! That's bound to be good. Uh... 7! It's 12!

4933
02:52:21,154 --> 02:52:22,972
Matt: 12 is the DC! So yeah!

4934
02:52:22,972 --> 02:52:24,402
Travis: (elated laughter)

4935
02:52:24,402 --> 02:52:25,990
Matt: You pull back the chain and as you do,

4936
02:52:25,990 --> 02:52:27,622
the blade is resisting,

4937
02:52:27,622 --> 02:52:31,242
it's stuck in the torso and it actually - (whoosh) - and flies back,

4938
02:52:31,242 --> 02:52:32,582
and you just barely catch it.

4939
02:52:32,582 --> 02:52:33,707
Grog: Oh shit!

4940
02:52:33,707 --> 02:52:35,782
Marisha: I love your joy sounds!

4941
02:52:35,782 --> 02:52:38,242
Grog: Meant to do that!

4942
02:52:38,242 --> 02:52:39,216
Meant to do that of course.

4943
02:52:39,216 --> 02:52:40,862
Matt: Now it's its turn.

4944
02:52:40,862 --> 02:52:41,603
Sam: Oh Jesus.

4945
02:52:41,603 --> 02:52:42,654
Laura: Oh no!

4946
02:52:42,654 --> 02:52:44,405
Matt: (Slithering noises.)

4947
02:52:44,405 --> 02:52:45,412
Laura: (Nervous noises.) Oh no!

4948
02:52:45,412 --> 02:52:46,819
Grog: Yeah, yeah, come on!

4949
02:52:46,819 --> 02:52:48,882
Sam: What? Why me? No, that's not me, that's not me.

4950
02:52:48,882 --> 02:52:50,082
Matt: For its size, when it moves,

4951
02:52:50,082 --> 02:52:51,794
it moves in a burst of lightning energy.

4952
02:52:51,794 --> 02:52:55,342
It's too fast for its corpulent form.

4953
02:52:55,342 --> 02:52:58,042
As it goes behind to Keyleth and Tiberius,

4954
02:52:58,042 --> 02:53:02,478
it makes an attack with each of its five heads.

4955
02:53:02,478 --> 02:53:05,362
Two on Tiberius, three on Keyleth.

4956
02:53:05,362 --> 02:53:06,786
Remember, you guys have Stoneskin, so I believe

4957
02:53:06,786 --> 02:53:07,742
you have resistance against damage, right?

4958
02:53:07,742 --> 02:53:08,522
Orion: Oh, yes, I do.

4959
02:53:08,522 --> 02:53:10,602
Matt: All right. So. Against Keyleth, it's a natural 20.

4960
02:53:10,602 --> 02:53:13,935
Group: Oh no!

4961
02:53:13,935 --> 02:53:17,953
Matt: That's a 12 plus 7, that's gonna be a 19 to hit?

4962
02:53:17,953 --> 02:53:20,482
Marisha: Yeah.

4963
02:53:20,482 --> 02:53:22,038
Matt: And natural 20 again.

4964
02:53:22,038 --> 02:53:24,788
Marisha: What the fuck!

4965
02:53:24,788 --> 02:53:26,077
Matt: So, 2 critical hits, and a hit on you -

4966
02:53:26,077 --> 02:53:27,459
Travis: What is this bullshit?

4967
02:53:27,459 --> 02:53:29,177
Matt: - and on Tiberius, that's a 22 to hit.

4968
02:53:29,177 --> 02:53:32,975
And a 13 to hit.

4969
02:53:32,975 --> 02:53:33,942
Orion: One does, one does not.

4970
02:53:33,942 --> 02:53:35,722
Matt: Okay, cool.

4971
02:53:35,722 --> 02:53:37,934
Matt: So, against Keyleth, you take -

4972
02:53:37,934 --> 02:53:40,131
Marisha: I'm glad I cast Stoneskin.

4973
02:53:40,131 --> 02:53:41,947
Matt: I know. So you take half damage for these. Which is fine.

4974
02:53:41,947 --> 02:53:43,293
Marisha: Yeah.

4975
02:53:43,293 --> 02:53:45,164
Matt: So, you're looking at - that's 2 plus 4, that's 6, damage halved,

4976
02:53:45,164 --> 02:53:46,322
you take 3 damage.

4977
02:53:46,322 --> 02:53:48,882
Oh, sorry. 3 multiplied by 2 because it's a critical.

4978
02:53:48,882 --> 02:53:50,541
So you take 6 damage from the first strike.

4979
02:53:50,541 --> 02:53:52,675
Laura: That's nothing! 6 damage.

4980
02:53:52,675 --> 02:53:54,847
Matt: Not too bad. You take 7 damage from the second strike,

4981
02:53:54,847 --> 02:54:00,963
and another 6 damage from the 3rd strike.

4982
02:54:00,963 --> 02:54:03,422
Actually, it would have been 6, 4 and 6.

4983
02:54:03,422 --> 02:54:05,662
Because you have resistance on the damage 'cause of Stoneskin.

4984
02:54:05,662 --> 02:54:08,102
Marisha: 6, 4 and 6?

4985
02:54:08,102 --> 02:54:10,828
Matt: Yes. However, make a constitution saving throw.

4986
02:54:10,828 --> 02:54:12,847
As venom from the fangs of the Naga begin to

4987
02:54:12,847 --> 02:54:14,868
pulse into your bloodstream.

4988
02:54:14,868 --> 02:54:17,122
Marisha: Ah, I should have taken the poison resistance.

4989
02:54:17,122 --> 02:54:19,006
He talked me out of it.

4990
02:54:19,006 --> 02:54:20,088
Taliesin: Yeah, I talked her out of it.

4991
02:54:20,088 --> 02:54:22,543
Marisha: What am I - constitution.

4992
02:54:22,543 --> 02:54:24,451
Matt: Yeah, constitution saving throw.

4993
02:54:24,451 --> 02:54:28,149
Marisha: Fuck!

4994
02:54:28,149 --> 02:54:29,442
Matt: Natural 1?

4995
02:54:29,442 --> 02:54:32,642
Natural 1 on the constitution saving throw.

4996
02:54:32,642 --> 02:54:33,702
Laura: Oh no!

4997
02:54:33,702 --> 02:54:35,412
Marisha: It's a bad day.

4998
02:54:35,412 --> 02:54:37,622
Matt: You feel this burning pain pulse into your bloodstream,

4999
02:54:37,622 --> 02:54:39,181
as your whole body doubles over from the pain.

5000
02:54:39,181 --> 02:54:41,692
Sam: Keyleth dies in episode 1.

5001
02:54:41,692 --> 02:54:44,882
Matt: You suffer 31 points of poison damage.

5002
02:54:44,882 --> 02:54:47,682
Marisha: 31, on top of the 6, 4 and 6?

5003
02:54:47,682 --> 02:54:49,222
Matt: Yep.

5004
02:54:49,222 --> 02:54:50,422
Travis: Are you okay?

5005
02:54:50,422 --> 02:54:51,062
Matt: The poison damage is not halved

5006
02:54:51,062 --> 02:54:53,520
because it is not a physical attack on your body.

5007
02:54:53,520 --> 02:54:54,690
Laura: Is Keyleth unconscious?

5008
02:54:54,690 --> 02:54:57,337
Sam: No, she's ok.

5009
02:54:57,337 --> 02:55:02,700
Matt: Tiberius you take 13 points of damage halved by Stoneskin

5010
02:55:02,700 --> 02:55:05,362
so you take a total of seven.

5011
02:55:05,362 --> 02:55:07,410
And also make a constitution saving throw.

5012
02:55:11,187 --> 02:55:12,106
What'cha got?

5013
02:55:14,885 --> 02:55:16,085
Orion: It's a 16.

5014
02:55:16,085 --> 02:55:18,105
Matt: 16, you manage to physically resist

5015
02:55:18,105 --> 02:55:20,005
the poison in your system.

5016
02:55:20,005 --> 02:55:22,105
You feel that slight tinge, the muscles tense,

5017
02:55:22,105 --> 02:55:24,968
but then your dragonborn form begins to just

5018
02:55:24,968 --> 02:55:27,365
shrug off the effect of the venom.

5019
02:55:27,365 --> 02:55:29,593
Orion: Can I turn to him and blow fire out of my nostrils?

5020
02:55:29,593 --> 02:55:30,645
Matt: Sure.

5021
02:55:30,645 --> 02:55:32,345
Orion: That's what I do.

5022
02:55:32,345 --> 02:55:34,585
Matt: True dragonborn challenge.

5023
02:55:34,585 --> 02:55:35,825
That brings us to Vax.

5024
02:55:35,825 --> 02:55:38,265
Liam: Okay, I start jogging backwards.

5025
02:55:38,265 --> 02:55:41,505
Marisha: Took me down to 16 hit points.

5026
02:55:41,505 --> 02:55:43,280
Liam: And can I sneak attack while prone.

5027
02:55:43,280 --> 02:55:46,282
Matt: You're stealthed currently so you would

5028
02:55:46,282 --> 02:55:48,045
technically get a sneak attack

5029
02:55:48,045 --> 02:55:49,838
but you have to be in melee for you to get the other bonus.

5030
02:55:49,838 --> 02:55:51,325
So it would be sneak attack for this damage if you were to roll

5031
02:55:51,325 --> 02:55:52,931
or if you were to throw a dagger at it,

5032
02:55:52,931 --> 02:55:54,325
you would get the sneak attack.

5033
02:55:54,325 --> 02:55:56,279
Liam: Okay, so that means just one throw instead of two?

5034
02:55:56,279 --> 02:55:58,261
Matt: You can throw both daggers at it.

5035
02:55:58,261 --> 02:56:00,885
Liam: All right. I feel so inspired by Scanlan's bardic tunes -

5036
02:56:00,885 --> 02:56:02,305
Scanlan: (singing) Yeah!

5037
02:56:02,305 --> 02:56:04,525
Matt: You can add it after you make the roll by the way.

5038
02:56:04,525 --> 02:56:07,356
Laura: So if you do a really good roll then you don't need it.

5039
02:56:07,356 --> 02:56:09,785
Liam: Okay, 19 plus eleven is thirty.

5040
02:56:09,785 --> 02:56:13,105
Matt: And because you're a rogue isn't that critical for you?

5041
02:56:13,105 --> 02:56:15,215
Liam: Yeah. Oh, yeah.

5042
02:56:15,215 --> 02:56:19,325
Matt: Two criticals!

5043
02:56:19,325 --> 02:56:22,825
Liam: And the other one, the other one is a 16 plus, plus...

5044
02:56:22,825 --> 02:56:24,405
is a 26.

5045
02:56:24,405 --> 02:56:25,162
Matt: That also hits.

5046
02:56:25,162 --> 02:56:27,955
So you chuck both daggers out, they both arc around.

5047
02:56:27,955 --> 02:56:34,704
Liam:  I meant to say I was aiming at its eye,

5048
02:56:34,704 --> 02:56:36,325
the main head's eye.

5049
02:56:36,325 --> 02:56:38,283
Laura: No, you should've said that first.

5050
02:56:38,283 --> 02:56:40,765
Matt: For flavor it's fine. Just go ahead, it's fine.

5051
02:56:40,765 --> 02:56:42,105
Liam: All right, four.

5052
02:56:42,105 --> 02:56:43,065
Laura: Four!

5053
02:56:43,065 --> 02:56:46,685
Liam: Plus seven is eleven plus five...

5054
02:56:46,685 --> 02:56:50,907
18. 20. 20 times...

5055
02:56:50,907 --> 02:56:52,365
is 40 plus 4.

5056
02:56:58,985 --> 02:57:00,285
44, that's the first dagger?

5057
02:57:00,285 --> 02:57:01,326
Matt: Yeah, 44 damage.

5058
02:57:01,326 --> 02:57:02,559
Liam: 44.

5059
02:57:02,559 --> 02:57:03,218
Travis: Damn!

5060
02:57:03,218 --> 02:57:04,045
Matt: Rogues, man.

5061
02:57:04,045 --> 02:57:06,985
Marisha: Help me. Help.

5062
02:57:06,985 --> 02:57:09,018
Laura: That's just one dagger?

5063
02:57:09,018 --> 02:57:10,845
Liam: That's just one- 4 plus 2 is 6.

5064
02:57:10,845 --> 02:57:12,609
Is that sneak attack? No.

5065
02:57:12,609 --> 02:57:13,305
Matt: No, only one sneak attack per turn.

5066
02:57:13,305 --> 02:57:14,865
Liam: Okay.

5067
02:57:14,865 --> 02:57:16,645
Laura: 40 and then 6 on the other one.

5068
02:57:16,645 --> 02:57:18,996
Matt: All right, so one actually hit one of the heads,

5069
02:57:18,996 --> 02:57:21,605
one of the various naga heads directly into its face.

5070
02:57:21,605 --> 02:57:24,585
As it does  it goes through both eyes and you can see it begin

5071
02:57:24,585 --> 02:57:26,964
reeling from the attack.

5072
02:57:28,671 --> 02:57:29,835
It’s looking pretty rough actually.

5073
02:57:29,835 --> 02:57:32,364
Laura: Oh! Kill it!

5074
02:57:32,364 --> 02:57:34,037
Matt: You can see the stitches beginning to come apart at

5075
02:57:34,037 --> 02:57:36,384
some of the seams and you can see a black ichorous liquid

5076
02:57:36,384 --> 02:57:38,983
spill out from some of the suture marks.

5077
02:57:38,983 --> 02:57:40,344
Liam: And just a reminder the daggers, folks,

5078
02:57:40,344 --> 02:57:42,361
blink back to the belt on my waist.

5079
02:57:42,361 --> 02:57:43,612
(all laugh)

5080
02:57:43,612 --> 02:57:45,584
Matt: Because magic.

5081
02:57:45,584 --> 02:57:48,402
Magic rogue shit.

5082
02:57:48,402 --> 02:57:50,284
Matt: Keyleth, you're up.

5083
02:57:50,284 --> 02:57:51,799
Laura: Kill him, kill him!

5084
02:57:51,799 --> 02:58:00,384
Marisha: Okay, so I'm really upset, really hurting.

5085
02:58:00,384 --> 02:58:02,544
So out of anger I take my staff and I go - (bam) -

5086
02:58:02,544 --> 02:58:04,004
and I crack and do Thunderwave

5087
02:58:04,004 --> 02:58:05,944
pushing him back 15 feet.

5088
02:58:05,944 --> 02:58:06,994
Matt: All right.

5089
02:58:06,994 --> 02:58:08,771
Makes the saving throw.

5090
02:58:08,771 --> 02:58:10,515
But he gets pushed back, so he takes damage just half damage.

5091
02:58:10,515 --> 02:58:15,571
Marisha: Okay, 2d8. 6.

5092
02:58:15,571 --> 02:58:16,564
Matt: As you're setting up your gun

5093
02:58:16,564 --> 02:58:19,707
it gets slammed right point blank to you.

5094
02:58:19,707 --> 02:58:20,584
Marisha: Oh sorry.

5095
02:58:20,584 --> 02:58:23,150
Laura and Travis: No that's good!

5096
02:58:23,150 --> 02:58:24,318
Marisha: It takes 4 damage.

5097
02:58:24,318 --> 02:58:26,628
Matt: 4 damage, all righty.

5098
02:58:26,628 --> 02:58:31,066
Marisha: And then I'm going to turn into an eagle.

5099
02:58:31,066 --> 02:58:33,804
Sam: (laughs) As one does.

5100
02:58:33,804 --> 02:58:35,751
Matt: So we'll say for that, because I forgot to bring an eagle,

5101
02:58:35,751 --> 02:58:40,784
You're now a - (eagle sounds)

5102
02:58:40,784 --> 02:58:43,064
Marisha: And I -

5103
02:58:43,064 --> 02:58:44,384
I fly...

5104
02:58:44,384 --> 02:58:46,240
away.

5105
02:58:46,240 --> 02:58:46,564
Travis: Away.

5106
02:58:46,564 --> 02:58:48,144
(all laugh)

5107
02:58:48,144 --> 02:58:49,384
Orion: Away.

5108
02:58:49,384 --> 02:58:51,662
Keyleth: Far far away.

5109
02:58:51,662 --> 02:58:54,044
Tiberius: Where are you going?!

5110
02:58:54,044 --> 02:58:55,038
Laura: You got 4 damage, good job Keyleth.

5111
02:58:55,038 --> 02:58:58,244
Scanlan: Tell our story, Keyleth.

5112
02:58:58,244 --> 02:58:59,137
Marisha: And then I cry in the corner and

5113
02:58:59,137 --> 02:59:01,375
rock back and forth a little bit.

5114
02:59:01,375 --> 02:59:02,534
And that's my turn.

5115
02:59:02,534 --> 02:59:03,785
Matt: I forgot to mention you actually take half damage

5116
02:59:03,785 --> 02:59:05,024
for the saving throw for the venom

5117
02:59:05,024 --> 02:59:06,572
so you still would've taken

5118
02:59:06,572 --> 02:59:08,104
14 points of poison damage, so just mark that.

5119
02:59:08,104 --> 02:59:09,764
Orion: Okay.

5120
02:59:09,764 --> 02:59:11,184
Matt: It is half damage on a save.

5121
02:59:11,184 --> 02:59:14,032
Matt: All right, that brings us to Scanlan.

5122
02:59:14,032 --> 02:59:18,438
Sam: Can I bonus inspire myself?

5123
02:59:18,438 --> 02:59:20,364
Matt: Because you're Scanlan I'll say, yes.

5124
02:59:20,364 --> 02:59:21,844
(all laugh)

5125
02:59:21,844 --> 02:59:25,504
Matt: You have such a high opinion of yourself

5126
02:59:25,504 --> 02:59:28,155
that even you could inspire yourself.

5127
02:59:28,155 --> 02:59:29,865
So yes, why not.

5128
02:59:29,865 --> 02:59:33,364
Scanlan: (singing) It would help me to acquire some dice to inspire.

5129
02:59:33,364 --> 02:59:36,184
So I inspire myself first

5130
02:59:36,184 --> 02:59:38,983
and move 5 feet back so I'm on the same row as him.

5131
02:59:38,983 --> 02:59:40,346
Matt: There?

5132
02:59:40,346 --> 02:59:40,644
Sam: Not that far.

5133
02:59:40,644 --> 02:59:41,399
Matt: There.

5134
02:59:41,399 --> 02:59:42,944
Sam: Yes.

5135
02:59:42,944 --> 02:59:44,822
And them I'm going to cast Lightning Bolt at him.

5136
02:59:44,822 --> 02:59:47,097
Matt: Okay! Straight line that way?

5137
02:59:47,097 --> 02:59:47,784
Sam: Straight line, that way.

5138
02:59:47,784 --> 02:59:50,454
Matt: You don't have to roll to hit.

5139
02:59:50,454 --> 02:59:51,474
You just roll damage on that.

5140
02:59:51,474 --> 02:59:52,569
I make a saving throw.

5141
02:59:52,569 --> 02:59:53,424
Sam: Oh! I didn't even need to inspire.

5142
02:59:53,424 --> 02:59:55,164
Matt: What's your DC on the spell?

5143
02:59:55,164 --> 02:59:55,984
Top you your spell list.

5144
02:59:55,984 --> 02:59:57,304
Orion: 17.

5145
02:59:57,304 --> 02:59:58,381
Sam: Thank you.

5146
02:59:58,381 --> 03:00:00,173
Matt: 17? That's a failure on its saving throw.

5147
03:00:00,173 --> 03:00:02,219
Go ahead and roll 8d6.

5148
03:00:02,219 --> 03:00:04,211
Laura: 8d6?!

5149
03:00:04,211 --> 03:00:06,502
Kill him!

5150
03:00:06,502 --> 03:00:09,480
Matt: Bards. Gets spells from other classes.

5151
03:00:09,480 --> 03:00:12,504
Travis: If you kill, I will take a shit on this table.

5152
03:00:12,504 --> 03:00:15,226
Sam: 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 ,11, 12, 13, 14 -

5153
03:00:15,226 --> 03:00:17,627
Liam: It's gone.

5154
03:00:17,627 --> 03:00:19,360
Sam: 24!

5155
03:00:19,360 --> 03:00:19,860
Matt: 24 points of lightning damage.

5156
03:00:19,860 --> 03:00:20,574
Travis: No way.

5157
03:00:20,574 --> 03:00:21,342
Sam: Yes.

5158
03:00:21,342 --> 03:00:22,540
Marisha: Kill it, kill it.

5159
03:00:22,540 --> 03:00:24,060
Sam: (yells, turns into a sung note)

5160
03:00:24,060 --> 03:00:25,923
Matt: How do you want to do this?

5161
03:00:25,923 --> 03:00:30,552
(all yelling)

5162
03:00:30,552 --> 03:00:32,180
Marisha: Wait, wait! Is this the first time you've -

5163
03:00:32,180 --> 03:00:35,357
Sam: I've never killed anything before!

5164
03:00:35,922 --> 03:00:37,925
Travis: Never killed anything in two years!

5165
03:00:37,939 --> 03:00:38,857
Liam: Wait, wait.

5166
03:00:38,857 --> 03:00:41,079
For the people at home, we live to hear Matt say:

5167
03:00:41,079 --> 03:00:42,839
All: "How do you want to do this?"

5168
03:00:42,839 --> 03:00:45,093
Matt: I let the player describe their victory.

5169
03:00:45,093 --> 03:00:48,038
So, as you sing to yourself to bolster your arcane energy,

5170
03:00:48,038 --> 03:00:50,287
you release a sheer bolt of energy.

5171
03:00:50,287 --> 03:00:52,398
How do you want to do this?

5172
03:00:52,398 --> 03:00:57,654
Sam: The bolt of lightning begins in its tail and works its way up

5173
03:00:57,654 --> 03:00:59,224
through its spine,

5174
03:00:59,224 --> 03:01:02,053
slowly but painfully torturing it

5175
03:01:02,053 --> 03:01:05,389
as it slowly, slowly feels the effect

5176
03:01:05,389 --> 03:01:08,659
coursing through its evil body.

5177
03:01:08,659 --> 03:01:13,591
Matt: Because of your bardic ability to actually shape sound

5178
03:01:13,591 --> 03:01:14,919
from an arcane standpoint,

5179
03:01:14,919 --> 03:01:16,639
a lightning bolt should be an instant flash

5180
03:01:16,639 --> 03:01:19,179
of arcane energy, you actually cause it to crawl.

5181
03:01:19,179 --> 03:01:21,693
You control it as it begins to cascade up the torso

5182
03:01:21,693 --> 03:01:24,199
of this horrible abomination.

5183
03:01:24,199 --> 03:01:26,899
As it does you can see the bolts splinter and destroy

5184
03:01:26,899 --> 03:01:31,052
each suture wound as each of its begins to slough off

5185
03:01:31,052 --> 03:01:32,519
the rest of the torso until nothing is left but the single head

5186
03:01:32,519 --> 03:01:34,739
screaming into the air.

5187
03:01:34,739 --> 03:01:36,215
As the bolt makes its way up the neck,

5188
03:01:36,215 --> 03:01:38,079
its eyes burst out in a blast of energy.

5189
03:01:38,079 --> 03:01:40,921
Matt: And the body falls limp to the ground.

5190
03:01:40,921 --> 03:01:43,959
Sam: Can it have a lightning bolt shaped in an "S"?

5191
03:01:43,959 --> 03:01:46,093
Matt: A Scanlan shaped lightning bolt

5192
03:01:46,093 --> 03:01:49,179
is burned into the torso of the strange naga beast.

5193
03:01:49,179 --> 03:01:52,339
(all cheer)

5194
03:01:52,339 --> 03:01:54,447
Travis: Well done Scanlan, well done!

5195
03:01:54,447 --> 03:01:57,166
Matt: As the dust settles, the adrenalin still pumping

5196
03:01:57,166 --> 03:01:59,200
in your system Scanlan,

5197
03:01:59,200 --> 03:02:01,219
all the rest of the dwarves begin stepping down,

5198
03:02:01,219 --> 03:02:03,099
putting their crossbows down, looking down at the little gnome

5199
03:02:03,099 --> 03:02:06,354
that created a storm from its hands and one of them

5200
03:02:06,354 --> 03:02:09,159
pats him on the shoulder and goes:

5201
03:02:09,159 --> 03:02:12,062
Dwarf: Well - well done.

5202
03:02:12,062 --> 03:02:16,959
Scanlan: Thank you. Just promise me you'll tell Pike about this.

5203
03:02:16,959 --> 03:02:19,119
Dwarf: Okay?

5204
03:02:19,119 --> 03:02:21,335
Scanlan: Because it was really cool, right?

5205
03:02:21,335 --> 03:02:22,699
Dwarf: That was pretty cool.

5206
03:02:22,699 --> 03:02:23,839
Scanlan: Okay, good.

5207
03:02:23,839 --> 03:02:27,152
Matt: All the dwarves look into the tunnel that it came from

5208
03:02:27,152 --> 03:02:29,079
and the one that you spoke to earlier goes:

5209
03:02:29,079 --> 03:02:32,560
Dwarf: So… that's the kind of thing that's been coming out of there.

5210
03:02:32,560 --> 03:02:34,219
Vex: Lovely.

5211
03:02:34,219 --> 03:02:35,363
Keyleth: Thanks for the heads up.

5212
03:02:35,363 --> 03:02:37,659
Percy: That was really helpful.

5213
03:02:37,659 --> 03:02:38,747
Matt: We'll go ahead and leave the game there for the night.

5214
03:02:38,747 --> 03:02:40,199
(all cheer)

5215
03:02:40,199 --> 03:02:42,619
Matt: All right folks, well done.

5216
03:02:42,619 --> 03:02:47,359
Hope you guys had fun watching our first ever Critical Role.

5217
03:02:47,359 --> 03:02:49,841
That was a good time so we'll be here next week on Thursday.

5218
03:02:49,841 --> 03:02:50,859
7 o'clock though.

5219
03:02:50,859 --> 03:02:52,279
Laura: 7 pm.

5220
03:02:52,279 --> 03:02:53,399
Matt: Today was just a special early edition because

5221
03:02:53,399 --> 03:02:54,916
all of Geek and Sundry is going to SXSW.

5222
03:02:54,916 --> 03:02:55,457
Zac: Good Job, dude.

5223
03:02:55,457 --> 03:02:57,630
Matt: Dude, thank you, Zac.

5224
03:02:57,630 --> 03:02:59,804
Zac: This is fun, this is so much fun.

5225
03:02:59,804 --> 03:03:00,499
Marisha: Hell yeah!

5226
03:03:00,499 --> 03:03:02,239
Zac: This is the most fun I've had all week now

5227
03:03:02,239 --> 03:03:04,519
until I die of stress behind the camera.

5228
03:03:04,519 --> 03:03:05,499
Matt: Good! That's good.

5229
03:03:05,499 --> 03:03:11,339
Zac: So guys, I hate to end it so abruptly

5230
03:03:11,339 --> 03:03:13,914
but we're actually packing up the cameras

5231
03:03:13,914 --> 03:03:17,417
that are filming me now, our unit, everything, lights,

5232
03:03:17,417 --> 03:03:20,398
and getting on a plane and heading to SXSW.

5233
03:03:20,398 --> 03:03:24,425
We may stream tomorrow, we may not, we're flying blind,

5234
03:03:24,425 --> 03:03:26,828
we'll see what stuff looks like when we get there.

5235
03:03:26,828 --> 03:03:30,217
But thank you guys so much and we'll be back next week, 7 pm.

5236
03:03:30,217 --> 03:03:31,379
Matt: 7pm.

5237
03:03:31,379 --> 03:03:33,480
Zac: Next week guys, it’s gonna be great.

5238
03:03:33,480 --> 03:03:34,499
Matt: Thank you all for coming.
