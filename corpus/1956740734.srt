1
00:00:02,393 --> 00:00:03,873
It's not even a discussion.

2
00:00:04,004 --> 00:00:06,397
You are dating the
assistant district attorney.

3
00:00:06,528 --> 00:00:08,834
We have gone out a few times.

4
00:00:08,965 --> 00:00:10,575
We are definitely not dating.

5
00:00:10,706 --> 00:00:12,621
That depends on
whether it's once or twice.

6
00:00:12,751 --> 00:00:14,840
The distinction
is critical.

7
00:00:14,971 --> 00:00:16,059
If you've gone out once,

8
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:18,235
then you
have dated.

9
00:00:18,366 --> 00:00:20,368
If you're going out
more than once

10
00:00:20,498 --> 00:00:21,717
then you definitely
are dating.

11
00:00:21,847 --> 00:00:23,110
Hey,
this is a robbery...

12
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:25,938
You've been out
of it for a while,

13
00:00:26,069 --> 00:00:27,418
but I'm actively
on the scene...

14
00:00:27,549 --> 00:00:28,854
So I want to give you
some free advice, okay?

15
00:00:28,985 --> 00:00:30,334
Cash, from the till,
come on.

16
00:00:30,465 --> 00:00:31,422
Why stop
at the A.D.A.?
Shh, shh, shh!

17
00:00:31,553 --> 00:00:32,119
What?

18
00:00:34,643 --> 00:00:35,426
We got a problem.

19
00:00:35,557 --> 00:00:37,385
Get up.

20
00:00:37,515 --> 00:00:39,039
Against the wall.
Stay there.

21
00:00:39,169 --> 00:00:40,127
Stay there.

22
00:00:42,259 --> 00:00:43,521
Hey...
Hey!

23
00:00:43,652 --> 00:00:44,957
Uh-uh.

24
00:00:45,088 --> 00:00:46,176
Put the gun
on the counter.

25
00:00:48,831 --> 00:00:49,832
Put your hands
where I can see them.

26
00:00:49,962 --> 00:00:50,963
Up, up!

27
00:00:51,094 --> 00:00:52,313
And step back.

28
00:00:55,229 --> 00:00:57,231
He's going out
the back door!

29
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:00,364
Out of the way!

30
00:01:00,495 --> 00:01:01,583
Stop, stop!

31
00:01:15,771 --> 00:01:16,946
Hey!

32
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:18,774
Freeze!

33
00:01:21,211 --> 00:01:22,430
Get down!

34
00:01:24,997 --> 00:01:25,868
Cross
your ankles!

35
00:01:25,998 --> 00:01:27,435
Are you
kidding me?

36
00:01:27,565 --> 00:01:29,132
Where were you going, were you
going to fly off of here?

37
00:01:34,224 --> 00:01:35,660
You are in
some serious,

38
00:01:35,791 --> 00:01:37,358
serious trouble,

39
00:01:37,488 --> 00:01:39,969
making me run up those stairs
in these heels.

40
00:01:50,719 --> 00:01:52,112
Jamie...

41
00:01:55,767 --> 00:01:58,466
"Have dated," "are dating,"
big difference.

42
00:01:58,596 --> 00:01:59,119
Enough.

43
00:01:59,249 --> 00:02:01,469
Hello, Dan.

44
00:02:01,599 --> 00:02:03,471
Hi, Dan.

45
00:02:03,601 --> 00:02:05,255
Hello, Glenn.

46
00:02:05,386 --> 00:02:07,170
So, uh,
I understand

47
00:02:07,301 --> 00:02:08,867
congratulations
are in order.

48
00:02:08,998 --> 00:02:10,130
For what?

49
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:12,393
This guy,
Andrew germaine.

50
00:02:12,523 --> 00:02:14,221
Drug dealer,
armed robber.

51
00:02:14,351 --> 00:02:16,005
You brought him in
all by yourself.

52
00:02:18,921 --> 00:02:21,837
Well, actually,
I did all the running,

53
00:02:21,967 --> 00:02:24,492
but Glenn did
the handcuffing,

54
00:02:24,622 --> 00:02:25,928
because I still haven't
worked out those things.

55
00:02:26,058 --> 00:02:27,451
I still have to practice
a little bit.

56
00:02:28,974 --> 00:02:30,367
So...

57
00:02:30,498 --> 00:02:31,412
What do you think, celebration?

58
00:02:31,542 --> 00:02:32,717
Tonight?

59
00:02:32,848 --> 00:02:33,327
Mmm, can't tonight.

60
00:02:33,457 --> 00:02:35,024
Already have plans.

61
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:36,895
Oh...

62
00:02:37,026 --> 00:02:38,201
All right.

63
00:02:38,332 --> 00:02:40,943
Well, we'll stick
to the weekend.

64
00:02:53,782 --> 00:02:56,611
See you tomorrow, boys.

65
00:03:04,096 --> 00:03:05,837
Hey there, stranger.

66
00:03:05,968 --> 00:03:07,448
What are you doing here?

67
00:03:07,578 --> 00:03:08,927
Well, I thought
I'd come down and find you

68
00:03:09,058 --> 00:03:10,277
since apparently

69
00:03:10,407 --> 00:03:11,365
you've chosen not to return
my phone calls.

70
00:03:14,585 --> 00:03:15,847
Peter, look...

71
00:03:15,978 --> 00:03:17,197
I know that I didn't react
the way you wanted me to,

72
00:03:17,327 --> 00:03:19,286
but you didn't
react

73
00:03:19,416 --> 00:03:21,201
the way
I wanted you to either.

74
00:03:21,331 --> 00:03:23,072
Well, thanks, mom.

75
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:24,552
No one turns an apology
into an accusation

76
00:03:24,682 --> 00:03:25,553
the way you do.

77
00:03:26,945 --> 00:03:28,556
I...
I didn't mean it like that.

78
00:03:32,734 --> 00:03:35,693
Look, you don't decide
where I live,

79
00:03:35,824 --> 00:03:37,565
who I live with,
or what I do with my life, okay?

80
00:03:37,695 --> 00:03:38,696
You have no say.

81
00:03:38,827 --> 00:03:41,046
No, I-I don't decide,

82
00:03:41,177 --> 00:03:42,570
but I definitely
have a say.

83
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:43,353
I'm your mother,

84
00:03:43,484 --> 00:03:45,442
and that's
what mothers do,

85
00:03:45,573 --> 00:03:46,965
or so I've heard.

86
00:03:47,705 --> 00:03:49,490
What do you want?

87
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:52,667
I want US to stop fighting
about all of this,

88
00:03:52,797 --> 00:03:54,799
and I you to come to dinner,
tonight.

89
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:56,410
It's a bad idea.

90
00:03:56,540 --> 00:03:57,541
Why is it
a bad idea--

91
00:03:57,672 --> 00:03:58,455
mom, Kelly is not--

92
00:03:58,586 --> 00:03:59,456
yeah, no, I want
Kelly to come too.

93
00:03:59,587 --> 00:04:02,416
I want you
and Kelly to come.

94
00:04:02,546 --> 00:04:04,113
I can't stand this, Peter.

95
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:06,071
You know, we haven't spoken
since this started.

96
00:04:06,202 --> 00:04:08,117
Yeah, well,
you and Susan started it, mom.

97
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:10,032
No...

98
00:04:10,162 --> 00:04:11,773
I think you and Kelly
started it.

99
00:04:11,903 --> 00:04:13,688
You guys said
some pretty hurtful things.

100
00:04:13,818 --> 00:04:14,906
What, you think
you didn't say hurtful things?

101
00:04:15,037 --> 00:04:15,951
Okay, you see what I mean?

102
00:04:16,081 --> 00:04:16,952
That's why it's a bad idea.

103
00:04:19,955 --> 00:04:20,956
You want me
to beg?

104
00:04:21,086 --> 00:04:22,044
No.

105
00:04:22,174 --> 00:04:23,001
You want me to beg?

106
00:04:23,132 --> 00:04:23,785
No.

107
00:04:23,915 --> 00:04:25,569
I will go down there,

108
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:27,092
and I will humiliate you
in front of your friends,

109
00:04:27,223 --> 00:04:28,180
and don't think I'm above it,

110
00:04:28,311 --> 00:04:29,443
and you are not
too old for that, pal.

111
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:33,055
Okay.

112
00:04:33,185 --> 00:04:34,622
Wha--

113
00:04:34,752 --> 00:04:35,231
what?

114
00:04:37,407 --> 00:04:39,235
Okay.

115
00:04:39,366 --> 00:04:40,628
And a smile to boot.

116
00:04:40,758 --> 00:04:41,759
Was that so hard?

117
00:04:41,890 --> 00:04:43,021
Okay, we'll come.

118
00:04:43,152 --> 00:04:44,327
We'll be there.

119
00:04:44,458 --> 00:04:45,807
I'm exhausted.

120
00:04:45,937 --> 00:04:46,895
7:00.

121
00:04:47,025 --> 00:04:48,244
Sounds like a party.

122
00:04:48,375 --> 00:04:49,767
Okay, don't be late.

123
00:05:33,594 --> 00:05:35,552
Hey...

124
00:05:35,683 --> 00:05:37,337
So did you ask him?

125
00:05:37,467 --> 00:05:41,341
Somewhere between asking
and pleading and begging, yeah.

126
00:05:41,471 --> 00:05:43,212
Are they coming?

127
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:44,953
Well, so he says.

128
00:05:45,083 --> 00:05:47,956
Actually, his exact words were
"sounds like a party."

129
00:05:48,086 --> 00:05:49,305
Hmm...

130
00:05:49,436 --> 00:05:51,002
Well, it's not like my daughter
to miss a party.

131
00:05:51,133 --> 00:05:52,221
No, it's not.

132
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:53,396
Not like me to go to one.

133
00:05:54,615 --> 00:05:56,356
I'm so
not looking forward to this.

134
00:05:56,486 --> 00:05:59,489
Come on, it'll be fun.

135
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:01,143
Is that a new coat?

136
00:06:01,273 --> 00:06:02,318
Yes, do you like it?

137
00:06:02,449 --> 00:06:03,885
Very nice.

138
00:06:04,015 --> 00:06:04,929
7:00!

139
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:05,930
I'll bring the wine.

140
00:06:11,849 --> 00:06:13,677
All right, go on.

141
00:06:23,513 --> 00:06:25,776
There's more bread,

142
00:06:25,907 --> 00:06:26,342
if anybody
wants any.

143
00:06:39,224 --> 00:06:41,575
Well, congratulations.

144
00:06:41,705 --> 00:06:44,621
This is a new world record
for avoiding the subject.

145
00:06:44,752 --> 00:06:46,971
We're not avoiding the subject.

146
00:06:47,102 --> 00:06:49,844
No, we're just
dancing around it.

147
00:06:49,974 --> 00:06:51,019
Look, we know
what we're doing.

148
00:06:51,149 --> 00:06:52,324
We're adults.

149
00:06:52,455 --> 00:06:53,978
You're 21, Kelly.

150
00:06:54,109 --> 00:06:55,458
Peter's only 19.

151
00:06:55,589 --> 00:06:57,547
Adults don't date for five days

152
00:06:57,678 --> 00:06:58,679
and then get engaged
without any discussion.

153
00:07:00,637 --> 00:07:02,204
Why don't you try
living together

154
00:07:02,334 --> 00:07:03,510
for a while?

155
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:05,599
Well, we have known each other
our whole lives.

156
00:07:05,729 --> 00:07:07,557
I don't think
anyone is debating

157
00:07:07,688 --> 00:07:09,429
that that's a wonderful thing,

158
00:07:09,559 --> 00:07:11,518
but Kelly,
sweetheart,

159
00:07:11,648 --> 00:07:14,390
you just came out of
this long relationship

160
00:07:14,521 --> 00:07:15,565
with this guy--
mom...

161
00:07:15,696 --> 00:07:16,784
Shh.

162
00:07:16,914 --> 00:07:17,959
And...

163
00:07:18,089 --> 00:07:19,351
You just moved out
of his house,

164
00:07:19,482 --> 00:07:20,657
you move into

165
00:07:20,788 --> 00:07:22,180
your mother's
garage apartment.

166
00:07:22,311 --> 00:07:23,617
Now you're living with Peter,
and now you're engaged?

167
00:07:23,747 --> 00:07:25,619
I just don't understand.

168
00:07:25,749 --> 00:07:27,621
Did you ever think that
there was a possibility

169
00:07:27,751 --> 00:07:31,059
this could be a bit
of a rebound relationship?

170
00:07:31,189 --> 00:07:33,017
We know what we want.

171
00:07:33,148 --> 00:07:34,192
Five days
of dating

172
00:07:34,323 --> 00:07:35,672
and two weeks of living together

173
00:07:35,803 --> 00:07:38,109
is not enough time
to make a judgment

174
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,328
about what you want.

175
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:41,722
What we want
is to get married, okay?

176
00:07:41,852 --> 00:07:42,810
Yeah.

177
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:44,072
Sooner the better.

178
00:07:44,202 --> 00:07:45,856
The sooner
the better?

179
00:07:45,987 --> 00:07:47,379
What is the rush?

180
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:50,208
Kelly, you're going
too fast.

181
00:07:50,339 --> 00:07:52,036
You just broke up
with ray.

182
00:07:52,167 --> 00:07:54,343
You were supposed to
marry him, remember?

183
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:55,257
They're going to
revoke my licence

184
00:07:55,387 --> 00:07:56,476
and kick me out of high school.

185
00:07:56,606 --> 00:07:58,347
I'm not fit to be
a guidance counselor.

186
00:07:59,174 --> 00:08:01,045
When were you two
thinking of doing this?

187
00:08:01,176 --> 00:08:02,133
End of the month.

188
00:08:02,264 --> 00:08:03,744
That's 10 days
from now!

189
00:08:03,874 --> 00:08:05,267
What kind of a wedding
are you going to have

190
00:08:05,397 --> 00:08:06,311
in 10 days from now?

191
00:08:06,442 --> 00:08:07,965
Who are you
inviting?

192
00:08:08,096 --> 00:08:09,576
I mean, do I
even know them?

193
00:08:09,706 --> 00:08:11,055
I knew this
would happen.
Okay, Kelly,
just sit down...

194
00:08:11,186 --> 00:08:11,926
No.
Where are you going?

195
00:08:12,056 --> 00:08:13,101
To celebrate.

196
00:08:13,231 --> 00:08:15,277
That's if we're all done
celebrating here.

197
00:08:16,452 --> 00:08:17,192
Kelly...

198
00:08:17,322 --> 00:08:18,585
I'll be outside,
Peter.

199
00:08:18,715 --> 00:08:20,500
Great.

200
00:08:23,198 --> 00:08:25,461
Don't say I didn't try.

201
00:08:25,592 --> 00:08:27,811
Thanks
for dinner.

202
00:08:27,942 --> 00:08:29,552
Okay.

203
00:08:32,599 --> 00:08:35,384
Well,
that was fun.

204
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:36,341
You should have
said something.

205
00:08:37,995 --> 00:08:39,214
I did.

206
00:08:39,344 --> 00:08:41,564
I said that
we've known each other

207
00:08:41,695 --> 00:08:43,523
our whole lives,
and now we want to get married.

208
00:08:43,653 --> 00:08:45,612
Yeah, but you just sat there
like it was nothing.

209
00:08:45,742 --> 00:08:47,222
Like you didn't
really mean it.

210
00:08:47,352 --> 00:08:49,006
You should've stood up
and gone crazy on them.

211
00:08:49,137 --> 00:08:50,051
Crazy?

212
00:08:51,443 --> 00:08:52,357
Kelly...

213
00:08:52,488 --> 00:08:53,576
This is nothing
to get crazy over.

214
00:08:53,707 --> 00:08:56,144
Come on...

215
00:08:56,274 --> 00:08:59,713
They can't stop US.

216
00:08:59,843 --> 00:09:01,671
They're going to get used it,

217
00:09:01,802 --> 00:09:02,629
okay?

218
00:09:02,759 --> 00:09:04,979
All right?

219
00:09:05,109 --> 00:09:07,155
They can't stop US.

220
00:09:17,861 --> 00:09:21,473
Don't you ever
lose it, Peter?

221
00:09:21,604 --> 00:09:23,171
Hmm?

222
00:09:24,607 --> 00:09:27,567
Just... let it go?

223
00:09:34,704 --> 00:09:36,576
Is that
what you want?

224
00:09:36,706 --> 00:09:38,578
Mm-hm.

225
00:09:41,232 --> 00:09:44,018
Why is she
doing this?

226
00:09:44,148 --> 00:09:45,149
To make you crazy.

227
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:46,803
Well, it's working.

228
00:09:46,934 --> 00:09:48,544
She's not over ray.

229
00:09:48,675 --> 00:09:50,677
I think they're
making a mistake.

230
00:09:54,463 --> 00:09:56,552
Perhaps we need
to come at this

231
00:09:56,683 --> 00:09:58,423
a different way.

232
00:09:58,554 --> 00:09:59,511
I think chaining her
in the closet

233
00:09:59,642 --> 00:10:00,861
until she's 30
is against the law.

234
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:05,213
Good idea, but, yeah,
I do think it's illegal.

235
00:10:05,343 --> 00:10:07,128
Isn't this just
parenting 101?

236
00:10:07,258 --> 00:10:08,303
You tell them
not to do something,

237
00:10:08,433 --> 00:10:10,305
they want to do it
even more?

238
00:10:10,435 --> 00:10:11,132
Yeah. So?

239
00:10:11,262 --> 00:10:14,091
What are you saying?

240
00:10:14,222 --> 00:10:17,704
I'm saying maybe it's not
the end of the world.

241
00:10:17,834 --> 00:10:20,097
I'm saying

242
00:10:20,228 --> 00:10:21,795
maybe we have to let them
make their own mistakes.

243
00:10:21,925 --> 00:10:24,580
Do we have to?

244
00:10:26,103 --> 00:10:27,104
Yeah, you're right.

245
00:10:31,326 --> 00:10:32,414
I can't believe
Peter was three

246
00:10:32,544 --> 00:10:33,894
when we
moved in here.

247
00:10:34,024 --> 00:10:35,069
Yeah, and Kelly,
she was what,

248
00:10:35,199 --> 00:10:37,680
she was five?

249
00:10:37,811 --> 00:10:40,378
Sure didn't plan on this,
did we?

250
00:10:42,119 --> 00:10:44,252
Hell of a lot
we didn't plan on.

251
00:10:46,689 --> 00:10:48,169
Right.

252
00:10:48,299 --> 00:10:51,302
I say we go to Renee's,
have a glass of champagne,

253
00:10:51,433 --> 00:10:53,130
and we tell those two
crazy kids of ours

254
00:10:53,261 --> 00:10:55,045
that if this is what
they want to do...

255
00:10:56,046 --> 00:10:57,134
They should go ahead and do it.

256
00:10:57,265 --> 00:10:58,483
They should just
do it.

257
00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:02,139
I say we go to Renee's,
have the champagne,

258
00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:03,924
and secretly sign them up
for the peace corps.

259
00:11:04,054 --> 00:11:05,752
Two years,
different continents,

260
00:11:05,882 --> 00:11:07,579
kind of like an adult time-out.

261
00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:08,624
Oh, is that a jungian concept,
is it?

262
00:11:10,278 --> 00:11:11,801
It's called
"if all else fails" therapy.

263
00:11:11,932 --> 00:11:14,021
You're not really
a child psychologist, are you?

264
00:11:14,151 --> 00:11:16,980
Not tonight.

265
00:11:17,111 --> 00:11:19,026
Come on, let's go.

266
00:11:21,463 --> 00:11:23,073
Hey, can we take your car?

267
00:11:23,204 --> 00:11:25,423
Yeah.

268
00:11:35,303 --> 00:11:37,479
You got lucky.

269
00:11:48,838 --> 00:11:53,190
He's supposed to be
out of town.

270
00:11:53,321 --> 00:11:54,496
Well, he's not.

271
00:11:57,847 --> 00:12:00,981
He's looking
at me.

272
00:12:01,111 --> 00:12:02,765
So don't look
back at him.

273
00:12:02,896 --> 00:12:04,027
Who cares
about him, kell?

274
00:12:04,158 --> 00:12:05,072
It doesn't matter
anyway.

275
00:12:05,202 --> 00:12:06,682
The guy's
an a-hole.

276
00:12:06,813 --> 00:12:08,640
You're not
going to do anything?

277
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:14,124
Kelly...

278
00:12:14,255 --> 00:12:14,908
He's over there,

279
00:12:15,038 --> 00:12:18,172
and we're
over here.

280
00:12:18,302 --> 00:12:20,000
Just let it go.

281
00:12:20,130 --> 00:12:21,915
Please.

282
00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:36,407
All right.

283
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:05,132
This is crap,
kell.

284
00:13:05,262 --> 00:13:07,221
I don't have to
be here. I can go.

285
00:13:07,351 --> 00:13:08,309
Why don't you
finish your beer,

286
00:13:08,439 --> 00:13:09,484
you can dump
your chump--

287
00:13:09,614 --> 00:13:10,790
hey...
And let's
get out of here.

288
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:11,747
What the hell
do you--

289
00:13:11,878 --> 00:13:12,792
you shut up,
arsehole!

290
00:13:12,922 --> 00:13:14,141
Want to show me
some I.D., bud?

291
00:13:15,925 --> 00:13:17,840
All right, kell,
let's get out of here.

292
00:13:17,971 --> 00:13:20,364
Come on, let's go.

293
00:13:22,062 --> 00:13:23,106
Get lost, loser.

294
00:13:23,237 --> 00:13:24,412
Get back here.

295
00:13:24,542 --> 00:13:26,066
Hey, what the hell
are you doing, man?

296
00:13:27,067 --> 00:13:28,068
Screw you, ray.

297
00:13:28,198 --> 00:13:29,591
Don't you get it?

298
00:13:29,721 --> 00:13:31,027
We're so over.

299
00:13:31,158 --> 00:13:33,334
I don't want to see you
ever again.

300
00:13:33,464 --> 00:13:35,118
You're going to pay for that,
you stupid witch.

301
00:13:36,511 --> 00:13:38,687
You'll see me
real frigging soon.

302
00:13:40,123 --> 00:13:43,823
You did that
on purpose.

303
00:13:43,953 --> 00:13:45,650
You set him up.

304
00:13:45,781 --> 00:13:46,695
You set me up,
Kelly,

305
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:48,001
and I don't work
like that.

306
00:13:48,131 --> 00:13:50,655
That's because
you don't love me.

307
00:13:50,786 --> 00:13:52,440
That is stupid, Kelly!

308
00:13:52,570 --> 00:13:54,442
Of course I love you.

309
00:13:54,572 --> 00:13:56,836
Just, why do always
have to test me?

310
00:13:56,966 --> 00:13:57,749
Why can't you just believe me?

311
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:01,492
Wait...

312
00:14:01,623 --> 00:14:02,885
What...

313
00:14:03,016 --> 00:14:04,844
Where are you
going?

314
00:14:04,974 --> 00:14:06,584
To my mother's.

315
00:14:06,715 --> 00:14:07,803
Just stay in the apartment.

316
00:14:07,934 --> 00:14:09,326
I don't want to see you.

317
00:14:09,457 --> 00:14:10,719
I don't want to see anybody.

318
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:12,416
Kelly, wait, just let me...
Kelly...

319
00:14:12,547 --> 00:14:13,374
Kelly!

320
00:14:14,984 --> 00:14:17,334
Dammit!

321
00:14:17,465 --> 00:14:18,770
I have school tomorrow.

322
00:14:18,901 --> 00:14:20,555
Innocent students

323
00:14:20,685 --> 00:14:21,904
that need comfort
and guidance.

324
00:14:22,035 --> 00:14:24,689
That's why I hate
staying out so late.

325
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:26,082
It's 1:00.

326
00:14:26,213 --> 00:14:27,214
Stop your whining.

327
00:14:27,344 --> 00:14:28,955
We'll be home
in 10 minutes.

328
00:14:29,085 --> 00:14:30,652
I remember
when you used to be fun.

329
00:14:30,782 --> 00:14:31,696
Hey...

330
00:14:31,827 --> 00:14:33,002
Give me the keys.
I'm driving.

331
00:14:33,133 --> 00:14:34,395
What if you get
pulled over?

332
00:14:34,525 --> 00:14:35,396
I'll show them
my badge.

333
00:14:35,526 --> 00:14:37,572
You do have it
with you, right?

334
00:14:37,702 --> 00:14:38,878
No.

335
00:14:39,008 --> 00:14:39,879
Oh, good plan.

336
00:14:43,056 --> 00:14:44,057
I wonder
where he's going

337
00:14:44,187 --> 00:14:45,710
in such a hurry.

338
00:14:47,799 --> 00:14:48,713
Ow!

339
00:14:48,844 --> 00:14:50,280
Switchblade
key.

340
00:14:50,411 --> 00:14:51,760
Lovely.

341
00:14:52,456 --> 00:14:54,850
Shamelessly flirting with him.
I couldn't believe it.

342
00:14:58,332 --> 00:14:59,376
Oh, my god.

343
00:14:59,507 --> 00:15:00,638
My house, Jamie!

344
00:15:00,769 --> 00:15:02,249
Oh, my god, Susan!

345
00:15:02,379 --> 00:15:03,119
Where's Kelly?
Kelly...

346
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:04,077
She's staying
at Peter's, right?

347
00:15:04,207 --> 00:15:05,034
I don't know.

348
00:15:05,165 --> 00:15:05,992
I don't know either.

349
00:15:11,998 --> 00:15:13,129
I live here.

350
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:14,304
This is my house.

351
00:15:14,435 --> 00:15:15,262
Is my daughter in there?

352
00:15:15,392 --> 00:15:16,654
Is there anybody in the house?

353
00:15:16,785 --> 00:15:17,960
It's her house.

354
00:15:18,091 --> 00:15:19,962
I'm detective mcdowell.
Did you check inside?

355
00:15:20,093 --> 00:15:22,704
They went in a few minutes ago.

356
00:15:22,834 --> 00:15:23,879
If anybody's in there,
they'll find them.

357
00:15:24,010 --> 00:15:25,663
We've been here
maybe five minutes.

358
00:15:25,794 --> 00:15:27,143
The place went up
like the fourth of July.

359
00:15:29,189 --> 00:15:31,060
Is that Kelly?

360
00:15:35,325 --> 00:15:36,848
Kelly!

361
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:46,119
Aw...

362
00:15:46,249 --> 00:15:47,642
Aw, Kelly...

363
00:15:47,772 --> 00:15:49,426
Kelly?

364
00:15:49,557 --> 00:15:50,427
Oh...

365
00:15:50,558 --> 00:15:52,429
Not my Kelly...

366
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:53,691
My son was with her.

367
00:15:53,822 --> 00:15:54,866
You go.

368
00:15:54,997 --> 00:15:56,172
Tell somebody
to go look for my son.

369
00:15:57,130 --> 00:15:58,044
Kelly...

370
00:15:58,174 --> 00:15:58,958
Tell someone!

371
00:15:59,088 --> 00:16:01,656
My son was with her!

372
00:16:03,353 --> 00:16:04,528
Kelly, no, no...

373
00:16:04,659 --> 00:16:05,877
Kelly...

374
00:16:08,358 --> 00:16:09,751
Kelly!

375
00:16:09,881 --> 00:16:10,708
Shh.

376
00:16:11,927 --> 00:16:12,580
She was the only one.

377
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:13,755
Are you sure?

378
00:16:17,237 --> 00:16:18,281
Oh, my god...

379
00:16:18,412 --> 00:16:20,240
She's going to
be okay.

380
00:16:20,370 --> 00:16:21,502
Kelly...

381
00:16:21,632 --> 00:16:22,416
She's
going to be okay.

382
00:16:22,546 --> 00:16:23,895
Come on with me.

383
00:16:47,484 --> 00:16:50,183
She live here
full time?

384
00:16:50,313 --> 00:16:52,620
Off and on
since high school.

385
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:54,796
How old was she?

386
00:16:54,926 --> 00:16:56,754
21.

387
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:00,584
She smoked in bed.

388
00:17:00,715 --> 00:17:04,327
Her mother was always
on her about it.

389
00:17:06,416 --> 00:17:08,940
I see a dresser
reduced to ashes.

390
00:17:09,071 --> 00:17:10,464
That's got to
make me wonder.

391
00:17:10,594 --> 00:17:12,335
What dresser?

392
00:17:12,466 --> 00:17:13,423
Oh, jeez...

393
00:17:13,554 --> 00:17:15,338
Okay...

394
00:17:15,469 --> 00:17:18,167
Girl comes home, passes out,

395
00:17:18,298 --> 00:17:20,952
her cigarette sets
the sheets on fire,

396
00:17:21,083 --> 00:17:22,606
that lights the bed on fire.

397
00:17:22,737 --> 00:17:23,912
So our bed
is the heat source, right?

398
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:26,349
That's what we call
"a set."

399
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,960
You know, what we should
be seeing is a single "v,"

400
00:17:29,091 --> 00:17:31,441
coming away
going up the wall

401
00:17:31,572 --> 00:17:32,790
from this original set.

402
00:17:32,921 --> 00:17:34,879
Now, why do I see
a "v" here

403
00:17:35,010 --> 00:17:36,055
and another one
here?

404
00:17:36,185 --> 00:17:38,927
Multiple sets

405
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:40,842
means multiple points of origin.

406
00:17:44,193 --> 00:17:45,847
No...

407
00:17:45,977 --> 00:17:47,979
This is not the cause
of the original fire.

408
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:49,068
What?

409
00:17:54,116 --> 00:17:57,206
Yeah...

410
00:17:57,337 --> 00:17:59,165
Presence of an accelerant.

411
00:18:00,949 --> 00:18:01,732
Hell, you can
still smell it.

412
00:18:03,169 --> 00:18:04,648
It's a petroleum
product.

413
00:18:04,779 --> 00:18:06,346
Gasoline,
kerosene, diesel.

414
00:18:06,476 --> 00:18:08,609
The lab will tell US
what it is for sure,

415
00:18:08,739 --> 00:18:12,178
but it's definitely
petroleum.

416
00:18:12,308 --> 00:18:13,179
You keep gasoline
in your bedroom,

417
00:18:13,309 --> 00:18:16,573
detective?

418
00:18:17,357 --> 00:18:19,272
No.

419
00:18:21,622 --> 00:18:24,233
Uh, so-so we have multiple sets
and evidence of an accelerant?

420
00:18:24,364 --> 00:18:26,670
Someone poured gasoline
on the walls,

421
00:18:26,801 --> 00:18:27,976
the furniture, the bed,

422
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:30,674
and then
just lit a match.

423
00:18:32,459 --> 00:18:36,332
Hey, tape this off,
secure it as a crime scene.

424
00:18:36,463 --> 00:18:38,639
What we have here is arson.

425
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:53,958
You all right?

426
00:18:57,353 --> 00:18:59,573
I'm actually more concerned
about Peter.

427
00:18:59,703 --> 00:19:02,097
He's a mess.

428
00:19:02,228 --> 00:19:03,316
He was with her last night.

429
00:19:04,621 --> 00:19:06,623
We're going to need to ask him
what happened

430
00:19:06,754 --> 00:19:07,363
before the fire,
right?

431
00:19:07,494 --> 00:19:09,365
Yeah.
No, I know, I know.

432
00:19:09,496 --> 00:19:10,453
He's at his house.

433
00:19:10,584 --> 00:19:11,411
He's not going anywhere.

434
00:19:14,805 --> 00:19:15,893
I found this cloth...

435
00:19:17,243 --> 00:19:19,332
Stuck on that fence,

436
00:19:19,462 --> 00:19:20,898
near the top of the driveway.

437
00:19:23,249 --> 00:19:26,730
It smells of gas.

438
00:19:29,211 --> 00:19:30,169
I'll be up there.

439
00:19:31,692 --> 00:19:33,520
I want you to print
this whole area here.

440
00:19:33,650 --> 00:19:34,651
Bring in
the team.

441
00:19:34,782 --> 00:19:36,175
Yes, sir.

442
00:20:10,818 --> 00:20:12,863
Why would anyone
want to do that?

443
00:20:12,994 --> 00:20:15,431
I just don't get it.

444
00:20:15,562 --> 00:20:16,737
People intentionally
set fires

445
00:20:16,867 --> 00:20:18,042
for a lot
of reasons.

446
00:20:18,173 --> 00:20:19,218
Insurance claims,
structural assault,

447
00:20:19,348 --> 00:20:21,481
juvenile delinquency.

448
00:20:21,611 --> 00:20:24,005
We change our
investigative approach

449
00:20:24,135 --> 00:20:26,181
when the arson
includes a homicide.

450
00:20:26,312 --> 00:20:29,358
Peter...

451
00:20:29,489 --> 00:20:31,360
There's going to have to be
an autopsy.

452
00:20:35,364 --> 00:20:38,498
What if it was a mistake?

453
00:20:41,196 --> 00:20:42,806
What if it wasn't arson?

454
00:20:42,937 --> 00:20:44,068
There was
no mistake.

455
00:20:44,199 --> 00:20:46,201
There was gasoline everywhere.

456
00:20:48,638 --> 00:20:50,031
Peter...

457
00:20:53,339 --> 00:20:54,470
Can you think of any reason

458
00:20:54,601 --> 00:20:55,645
why someone would want
to kill Kelly?

459
00:20:57,473 --> 00:20:59,432
I...

460
00:20:59,562 --> 00:21:03,044
I should never have let her
go home alone.

461
00:21:03,174 --> 00:21:06,047
I don't know
what I was thinking.

462
00:21:06,177 --> 00:21:08,092
You can't
blame yourself.

463
00:21:10,747 --> 00:21:13,620
Well, if there's going to be
an investigation,

464
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:14,708
I want you to lead it.

465
00:21:14,838 --> 00:21:15,926
I can't do that.

466
00:21:16,057 --> 00:21:17,188
You know I can't.

467
00:21:19,190 --> 00:21:21,105
Don't worry,

468
00:21:21,236 --> 00:21:22,585
we'll find out
who did this.

469
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:25,414
What happened
to your hand there?

470
00:21:25,545 --> 00:21:29,113
I hurt it at work.

471
00:21:30,550 --> 00:21:33,161
You asked me

472
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:34,162
who I thought
would hurt Kelly.

473
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:36,469
Try her ex-fiance.

474
00:21:38,253 --> 00:21:39,298
Ray rankin.

475
00:21:39,428 --> 00:21:41,909
He was at the bar
last night.

476
00:21:42,039 --> 00:21:43,258
Kelly threw a beer
in his face.

477
00:21:43,389 --> 00:21:44,520
He threatened her

478
00:21:44,651 --> 00:21:49,917
and then he took off
out of the bar.

479
00:21:50,047 --> 00:21:51,005
Ray threatened her?

480
00:21:51,135 --> 00:21:53,355
Yeah.

481
00:21:56,358 --> 00:21:57,403
He...

482
00:21:57,533 --> 00:22:00,667
He said she'd pay,

483
00:22:00,797 --> 00:22:03,713
said...

484
00:22:03,844 --> 00:22:05,889
She'd see him real soon.

485
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:08,544
Anybody else
hear him say this?

486
00:22:08,675 --> 00:22:09,850
Only the whole bar.

487
00:22:12,592 --> 00:22:13,593
Kelly was...

488
00:22:13,723 --> 00:22:15,377
Really upset.

489
00:22:15,508 --> 00:22:17,161
She got into a cab,
and she went to her mother's.

490
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:19,642
We're so wasted.

491
00:22:19,773 --> 00:22:20,687
We don't even know
what we're saying

492
00:22:20,817 --> 00:22:21,731
right now, okay?

493
00:22:21,862 --> 00:22:22,950
Let's just go home,
come on.

494
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:25,300
Let's just
go home, Kelly.

495
00:22:25,431 --> 00:22:26,693
Where are you going?

496
00:22:26,823 --> 00:22:27,781
To my mother's.

497
00:22:27,911 --> 00:22:30,174
Just stay
in the apartment.

498
00:22:30,305 --> 00:22:31,219
I don't want
to see you.

499
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:32,176
I don't want
to see anybody.

500
00:22:32,307 --> 00:22:33,830
Kelly!

501
00:22:49,890 --> 00:22:50,891
You should
let me drive.

502
00:22:51,021 --> 00:22:51,544
No.

503
00:22:51,674 --> 00:22:52,414
Or wait in the car?

504
00:22:52,545 --> 00:22:56,113
Nope.

505
00:22:56,244 --> 00:22:57,854
Uh... let me
do the talking?

506
00:22:57,985 --> 00:22:58,377
Probably not.

507
00:23:15,655 --> 00:23:17,308
Ray rankin?

508
00:23:57,914 --> 00:23:59,350
What do you want?

509
00:23:59,481 --> 00:24:00,526
There was a fire
at Kelly's last night.

510
00:24:00,656 --> 00:24:01,570
Did you know that?

511
00:24:01,701 --> 00:24:03,137
No, I didn't, bro.

512
00:24:03,267 --> 00:24:05,182
'Cause we're not
together anymore.

513
00:24:05,313 --> 00:24:06,662
It was a sex thing
anyway.

514
00:24:06,793 --> 00:24:10,100
Oh... you're a champ,
aren't you?

515
00:24:10,231 --> 00:24:11,493
Yeah,
thanks, buddy.

516
00:24:14,496 --> 00:24:17,412
She's dead.

517
00:24:17,543 --> 00:24:18,587
Where the hell
were you last night?

518
00:24:18,718 --> 00:24:20,415
I don't have to
answer that.

519
00:24:20,546 --> 00:24:22,286
Yes, you do.

520
00:24:22,417 --> 00:24:24,593
You're the ex-fiance
with the stellar record.

521
00:24:24,724 --> 00:24:25,812
Assault and battery,

522
00:24:25,942 --> 00:24:27,204
possession
with an intent to sell,

523
00:24:27,335 --> 00:24:28,858
grand theft, huh?

524
00:24:28,989 --> 00:24:30,120
You threatened her.

525
00:24:30,251 --> 00:24:31,252
You stormed out of there,

526
00:24:31,382 --> 00:24:32,688
you waited for her,

527
00:24:32,819 --> 00:24:34,473
you followed her
to her mother's house,

528
00:24:34,603 --> 00:24:36,257
you killed her, and then
you burnt that place down.

529
00:24:36,387 --> 00:24:37,432
Why don't you
get the hell off me?

530
00:24:37,563 --> 00:24:38,781
Jamie...

531
00:24:38,912 --> 00:24:40,130
Breaking and entering,
arson, homicide.

532
00:24:40,261 --> 00:24:41,697
Three aggravating
circumstances.

533
00:24:41,828 --> 00:24:43,438
That is the death penalty.

534
00:24:43,569 --> 00:24:45,875
Jamie!

535
00:24:46,006 --> 00:24:47,137
Screw you, mcdowell.

536
00:24:47,268 --> 00:24:48,312
Screw you,
and Kelly,

537
00:24:48,443 --> 00:24:51,272
and both
your families!

538
00:24:51,402 --> 00:24:52,534
I'm calling my lawyer.

539
00:24:56,190 --> 00:24:58,540
Third degree burns
to 80% of her body.

540
00:24:58,671 --> 00:25:01,151
All the physical evidence

541
00:25:01,282 --> 00:25:03,458
of death due to severe exposure
to fire, except...

542
00:25:03,589 --> 00:25:06,809
Except what?

543
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:09,029
Except there's no smoke
in her lungs.

544
00:25:09,159 --> 00:25:10,509
Asphyxiation occurred
before the fire.

545
00:25:10,639 --> 00:25:12,467
It's not what killed her.

546
00:25:12,598 --> 00:25:13,686
The fractured hyoid bone,

547
00:25:13,816 --> 00:25:17,254
the depressed larynx

548
00:25:17,385 --> 00:25:18,995
seem to suggest
strangulation,

549
00:25:19,126 --> 00:25:20,127
and she'd had
intercourse

550
00:25:20,257 --> 00:25:23,217
either before or during
the strangulation.

551
00:25:23,347 --> 00:25:24,435
I've got semen samples.

552
00:25:24,566 --> 00:25:25,872
We'll run them in the lab.

553
00:25:26,002 --> 00:25:28,396
It's hard to know for sure
whether or not she was raped.

554
00:25:28,527 --> 00:25:30,703
There's a lot
of burn damage

555
00:25:30,833 --> 00:25:32,052
in the area.

556
00:25:32,182 --> 00:25:33,444
I do see some evidence
of forced entry,

557
00:25:33,575 --> 00:25:36,143
but, well...

558
00:25:36,273 --> 00:25:38,406
Maybe it was rough sex
that got out of hand.

559
00:25:38,537 --> 00:25:42,018
There's a very high level
of alcohol in her bloodstream.

560
00:25:42,149 --> 00:25:44,064
If the killer was drinking
as much as she was,

561
00:25:44,194 --> 00:25:45,152
I can see it
all going south

562
00:25:45,282 --> 00:25:46,240
in a hurry.

563
00:25:46,370 --> 00:25:47,415
So you're saying it's a...

564
00:25:47,546 --> 00:25:50,549
Possible rape and strangulation?

565
00:25:50,679 --> 00:25:52,725
Something like that, yes.

566
00:25:53,987 --> 00:25:55,205
Right, uh...

567
00:25:55,336 --> 00:25:57,338
I'm going to let
the guys know, okay?

568
00:25:57,468 --> 00:25:58,557
I'll be right back.

569
00:26:01,734 --> 00:26:03,736
Any idea who did this,

570
00:26:03,866 --> 00:26:05,912
detective?

571
00:26:06,042 --> 00:26:06,869
Yeah, we have a suspect.

572
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,392
Yeah.

573
00:26:08,523 --> 00:26:10,569
Thank you, Miriam.

574
00:26:10,699 --> 00:26:12,658
You're welcome.

575
00:26:34,810 --> 00:26:38,901
He raped her?

576
00:26:43,514 --> 00:26:44,777
That son of a bitch.

577
00:26:44,907 --> 00:26:46,256
I know.

578
00:26:46,387 --> 00:26:47,910
Well, you got to get him.

579
00:26:49,651 --> 00:26:50,652
Yeah, we will.

580
00:26:55,483 --> 00:26:56,571
Does Susan know?

581
00:26:56,702 --> 00:26:57,528
Glenn's
with her now.

582
00:26:57,659 --> 00:26:58,617
He's telling her.

583
00:26:58,747 --> 00:27:02,882
Listen, Peter,

584
00:27:03,012 --> 00:27:04,361
I know how difficult this is
for you,

585
00:27:04,492 --> 00:27:06,929
and I hate
having to do this,

586
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:09,497
but I need you
to go through that night again

587
00:27:09,628 --> 00:27:10,716
and tell me
everything you remember,

588
00:27:10,846 --> 00:27:12,282
because we're trying
to re-construct

589
00:27:12,413 --> 00:27:13,240
the time-line,

590
00:27:13,370 --> 00:27:14,676
and what we know

591
00:27:14,807 --> 00:27:17,723
is that ray has no alibi
after he left that bar.

592
00:27:17,853 --> 00:27:19,159
Yeah, that's because
he followed her home

593
00:27:19,289 --> 00:27:20,682
to her apartment
and killed her.

594
00:27:20,813 --> 00:27:23,076
And that's exactly
what we're thinking,

595
00:27:23,206 --> 00:27:25,078
but if you can,

596
00:27:25,208 --> 00:27:27,210
let's go through it again.

597
00:27:27,341 --> 00:27:28,951
Okay.

598
00:27:29,082 --> 00:27:33,042
After we left your house,

599
00:27:33,173 --> 00:27:39,048
we went to Chelsea's
and the avalon first.

600
00:27:40,833 --> 00:27:43,009
Then we went to
the copper penny

601
00:27:43,139 --> 00:27:44,184
to play some pool,

602
00:27:44,314 --> 00:27:45,489
and I guess
it was, like, 10:30.

603
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:48,101
Was ray
already there?

604
00:27:48,231 --> 00:27:49,276
No.

605
00:27:49,406 --> 00:27:51,104
No, Kelly said
he had the night off,

606
00:27:51,234 --> 00:27:52,279
but he showed up for a shift
anyway.

607
00:27:52,409 --> 00:27:53,759
We had
a couple words,

608
00:27:53,889 --> 00:27:55,717
but it was really
nothing.

609
00:27:55,848 --> 00:27:58,067
How long
before the trouble began?

610
00:27:58,198 --> 00:28:00,200
Mmm...

611
00:28:00,330 --> 00:28:01,636
45 minutes, maybe.

612
00:28:01,767 --> 00:28:03,333
45 minutes...

613
00:28:03,464 --> 00:28:07,163
So that would put it 11:15.

614
00:28:07,294 --> 00:28:08,469
Ray leaves,
he's completely hammered.

615
00:28:08,599 --> 00:28:09,644
What time did Kelly leave?

616
00:28:09,775 --> 00:28:11,167
Maybe 20 minutes later.

617
00:28:11,298 --> 00:28:13,430
I mean...

618
00:28:13,561 --> 00:28:15,258
She was drunk
and pretty pissed off.

619
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:17,391
At you?

620
00:28:20,786 --> 00:28:23,963
She was taking it out on me,
but...

621
00:28:24,093 --> 00:28:25,051
Well...

622
00:28:25,181 --> 00:28:26,661
She was drunk.

623
00:28:26,792 --> 00:28:28,010
I don't even think
she knew what she was saying.

624
00:28:30,665 --> 00:28:32,362
Yeah, the cabbie said
it took 25 minutes

625
00:28:32,493 --> 00:28:34,147
to get from the copper penny
to Susan's house

626
00:28:34,277 --> 00:28:36,671
because Kelly was so drunk,

627
00:28:36,802 --> 00:28:40,544
she couldn't give even him
proper directions.

628
00:28:40,675 --> 00:28:41,850
Anyway...

629
00:28:41,981 --> 00:28:46,594
That puts her inside
at 10 after midnight,

630
00:28:46,725 --> 00:28:48,030
and we checked
her phone records.

631
00:28:48,161 --> 00:28:49,728
It looks like she called you
as soon as she got home.

632
00:28:49,858 --> 00:28:50,729
Is that right?

633
00:28:52,208 --> 00:28:53,906
Yeah.

634
00:28:54,036 --> 00:28:55,124
Yeah, but I wasn't home yet.

635
00:28:56,256 --> 00:28:57,736
I thought she'd blow off
some steam and come back.

636
00:29:00,913 --> 00:29:03,350
I left at midnight
and went home,

637
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:04,917
just hoping
she'd changed her mind

638
00:29:05,047 --> 00:29:05,831
and went to my place.

639
00:29:26,503 --> 00:29:28,592
It's me.

640
00:29:28,723 --> 00:29:31,160
I'm sorry, Peter,
but this isn't working.

641
00:29:31,291 --> 00:29:33,859
I'm going to stay at
my mom's for a few days.

642
00:29:33,989 --> 00:29:35,730
Just leave me alone
for a while, okay?

643
00:29:42,476 --> 00:29:45,784
So Kelly gets home
at 12:10,

644
00:29:45,914 --> 00:29:49,788
calls Peter 12:15
and leaves a message.

645
00:29:49,918 --> 00:29:51,746
That checks out,
right.

646
00:29:51,877 --> 00:29:53,530
Yeah, and then
sometime after 12:15,

647
00:29:53,661 --> 00:29:54,662
rankin breaks in,

648
00:29:54,793 --> 00:29:56,664
rapes
and murders her.

649
00:29:56,795 --> 00:29:58,361
Kelly expires...

650
00:29:58,492 --> 00:30:00,320
12:40, 12:45?

651
00:30:00,450 --> 00:30:02,061
Give him 10 minutes
to figure out what to do,

652
00:30:02,191 --> 00:30:04,585
goes to his vehicle,
gets his gas can,

653
00:30:04,715 --> 00:30:05,760
douses the place,

654
00:30:05,891 --> 00:30:06,761
sets the fire.

655
00:30:06,892 --> 00:30:08,850
That's about 12:50, 12:55.

656
00:30:08,981 --> 00:30:11,070
Right,
then he bolts out the door,

657
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:11,897
leaves a piece
of clothing behind...

658
00:30:12,027 --> 00:30:14,769
And you get home
at 1:00 am,

659
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:15,726
fire department's
already on the scene.

660
00:30:15,857 --> 00:30:18,077
It works.

661
00:30:18,207 --> 00:30:19,339
Yeah, it does.

662
00:30:19,469 --> 00:30:20,775
Only thing is,
we don't have any witnesses.

663
00:30:20,906 --> 00:30:23,038
That we know of.

664
00:30:23,169 --> 00:30:25,040
You're thinking reward?

665
00:30:25,171 --> 00:30:28,827
Well, I'm thinking
somebody had to have seen him,

666
00:30:28,957 --> 00:30:30,176
and now we just have
to give them a reason

667
00:30:30,306 --> 00:30:30,785
to come forward.

668
00:30:30,916 --> 00:30:32,700
True enough.

669
00:30:32,831 --> 00:30:35,616
Okay, so you talk to the captain
about the reward,

670
00:30:35,746 --> 00:30:37,096
and we'll...

671
00:30:37,226 --> 00:30:39,838
We'll canvass the neighborhood
one more time.

672
00:30:39,968 --> 00:30:41,274
Also, how you doing?
You okay?

673
00:30:41,404 --> 00:30:42,057
Look, um, Glenn?

674
00:30:42,188 --> 00:30:44,103
I'm going to get out of here.

675
00:30:44,233 --> 00:30:45,495
I'm going to call you back,
all right?

676
00:30:45,626 --> 00:30:47,106
Okay, well, stay in touch,
all right?

677
00:30:47,236 --> 00:30:48,324
All right.

678
00:30:53,939 --> 00:30:54,765
What?

679
00:30:58,987 --> 00:31:00,815
You got a minute?

680
00:31:00,946 --> 00:31:01,772
No.

681
00:31:05,428 --> 00:31:07,648
It's funny, I distinctly
heard myself say, "no."

682
00:31:07,778 --> 00:31:08,867
Yeah, that happens to me
all the time.

683
00:31:08,997 --> 00:31:09,998
It's called parenthood.

684
00:31:11,826 --> 00:31:13,436
I want US to offer a reward
on the Shaw murder.

685
00:31:15,612 --> 00:31:16,657
It's not your case, Jamie.

686
00:31:16,787 --> 00:31:17,701
I want US to offer 10 grand.

687
00:31:19,834 --> 00:31:21,749
Mcdowell, that's more than
three times department standard.

688
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:24,186
We can't
afford it.

689
00:31:24,317 --> 00:31:25,535
But I know who did it.

690
00:31:25,666 --> 00:31:27,015
I just need a witness
to come forward.

691
00:31:27,146 --> 00:31:29,888
You're too close
to this case, Jamie.

692
00:31:30,018 --> 00:31:31,280
Yeah, that's right, I am, Paul.

693
00:31:31,411 --> 00:31:32,673
It's my best friend's daughter.

694
00:31:32,803 --> 00:31:33,935
I've known her since
she was three years old.

695
00:31:35,110 --> 00:31:36,503
Now, I want US
to offer 10 grand,

696
00:31:36,633 --> 00:31:38,418
and I'm not leaving this
office until you say yes.

697
00:31:41,029 --> 00:31:41,943
Okay.

698
00:31:42,074 --> 00:31:44,685
Okay?

699
00:31:44,815 --> 00:31:46,469
10 grand.

700
00:31:50,778 --> 00:31:51,648
Thank you.

701
00:31:52,954 --> 00:31:53,824
Hey, mcdowell...

702
00:31:55,652 --> 00:31:56,653
You've done
what you can.

703
00:31:56,784 --> 00:31:57,959
Let US do the rest, all right?

704
00:32:08,578 --> 00:32:09,710
Thanks for
coming down.

705
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:12,582
Can I get you
some soda, coffee?

706
00:32:12,713 --> 00:32:13,714
Water?
Are you sure?

707
00:32:13,844 --> 00:32:15,063
Did you get him?

708
00:32:15,194 --> 00:32:17,457
No, not yet, but--

709
00:32:17,587 --> 00:32:19,415
but we have
offered a reward,

710
00:32:19,546 --> 00:32:20,764
for 10,000.

711
00:32:20,895 --> 00:32:21,940
It's a hell
of a lot more

712
00:32:22,070 --> 00:32:23,202
than I thought
my captain would go for,

713
00:32:23,332 --> 00:32:24,594
but he did.

714
00:32:24,725 --> 00:32:26,596
Has anyone
come forward?

715
00:32:26,727 --> 00:32:28,729
Yeah,
a few people,

716
00:32:28,859 --> 00:32:31,775
but nothing
we can use yet.

717
00:32:31,906 --> 00:32:32,951
But the good news is,

718
00:32:33,081 --> 00:32:35,127
is that now
ray knows

719
00:32:35,257 --> 00:32:37,216
it's just
a matter of time.

720
00:32:37,346 --> 00:32:39,392
He will make a mistake,
he will slip up,

721
00:32:39,522 --> 00:32:40,480
I promise you.

722
00:32:43,222 --> 00:32:45,006
Just...

723
00:32:45,137 --> 00:32:48,314
I just, I wish you were leading
this investigation.

724
00:32:48,444 --> 00:32:50,881
You know I can't.

725
00:32:53,145 --> 00:32:55,190
But between you and me,

726
00:32:55,321 --> 00:32:57,714
I'm very much
a part of this investigation.

727
00:32:57,845 --> 00:32:58,802
I'm just working through Glenn.

728
00:32:59,673 --> 00:33:00,587
Yeah?

729
00:33:02,328 --> 00:33:03,155
Come on,
let's get outside.

730
00:33:03,285 --> 00:33:04,939
Let's get
some fresh air.

731
00:33:18,387 --> 00:33:22,739
This is much harder
than when Steve died.

732
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:27,657
You lose your husband...

733
00:33:27,788 --> 00:33:29,964
You're heartbroken,

734
00:33:30,095 --> 00:33:31,357
but you have a child,

735
00:33:31,487 --> 00:33:34,708
so you soldier on

736
00:33:34,838 --> 00:33:38,973
and find a way
to keep living.

737
00:33:39,104 --> 00:33:42,237
Remarry, whatever.

738
00:33:42,368 --> 00:33:45,066
Did you feel like that
when Mike died?

739
00:33:48,983 --> 00:33:50,854
Yeah.

740
00:33:50,985 --> 00:33:52,726
I think so.
It was a long time ago.

741
00:33:52,856 --> 00:33:54,510
One day we're double-dating,

742
00:33:54,641 --> 00:33:57,644
the next, we're single moms
with little kids.

743
00:33:57,774 --> 00:33:58,601
Yeah, I know.

744
00:34:03,171 --> 00:34:05,608
But when your child dies...

745
00:34:05,739 --> 00:34:07,045
Especially like this,

746
00:34:07,175 --> 00:34:11,005
you're not just
heartbroken...

747
00:34:14,008 --> 00:34:18,839
You're dead.

748
00:34:18,969 --> 00:34:22,408
You die with them...

749
00:34:22,538 --> 00:34:26,890
And there's no soldiering on.

750
00:34:27,021 --> 00:34:29,502
There's just nothing.

751
00:34:31,330 --> 00:34:34,028
There's nothing.

752
00:34:36,030 --> 00:34:37,858
Susan, I'm so sorry.

753
00:34:39,903 --> 00:34:40,861
Sweetheart, I'm so sorry.

754
00:34:51,393 --> 00:34:54,788
Well, here we are.

755
00:34:54,918 --> 00:34:55,919
It was
a great meal.

756
00:34:56,050 --> 00:34:58,139
It certainly was,
and thank you very much.

757
00:34:58,270 --> 00:34:59,445
You're
very welcome.

758
00:34:59,575 --> 00:35:00,837
I think a nightcap
is in order.

759
00:35:00,968 --> 00:35:02,839
Absolutely, yeah.

760
00:35:06,016 --> 00:35:09,194
Dan...

761
00:35:09,324 --> 00:35:11,021
Sorry.
That's okay.

762
00:35:11,152 --> 00:35:13,807
No, that's okay.

763
00:35:13,937 --> 00:35:15,504
I'd still like
a nightcap, though.

764
00:35:15,635 --> 00:35:16,679
Absolutely.

765
00:35:16,810 --> 00:35:17,941
Okay.

766
00:35:18,072 --> 00:35:19,117
White wine,
is that good?

767
00:35:19,247 --> 00:35:20,553
Perfect.

768
00:35:20,683 --> 00:35:21,858
I have some open
in the fridge.

769
00:35:25,297 --> 00:35:27,125
It's a nice place
you got here.

770
00:35:27,255 --> 00:35:29,214
Oh, thanks.

771
00:35:45,882 --> 00:35:46,927
Oh, my god...

772
00:35:49,016 --> 00:35:50,191
Oh, my god...

773
00:35:53,238 --> 00:35:54,152
My... my cat...

774
00:35:54,282 --> 00:35:56,197
My cat, my cat...

775
00:36:02,856 --> 00:36:04,597
Oh, my god.

776
00:36:04,727 --> 00:36:05,902
Come on, let's
get out of here.

777
00:36:06,033 --> 00:36:07,208
Why?

778
00:36:20,526 --> 00:36:21,570
Fat lady's in the house.

779
00:36:21,701 --> 00:36:24,225
She's not singing yet,
but she's warming up.

780
00:36:27,489 --> 00:36:29,491
We got a reward.

781
00:36:29,622 --> 00:36:30,362
People are coming forward.

782
00:36:30,492 --> 00:36:32,190
It's just a matter of time.

783
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:34,104
One of the neighbors
down the street

784
00:36:34,235 --> 00:36:35,280
walking her dog,

785
00:36:35,410 --> 00:36:37,804
saw some punk
in a red hoody

786
00:36:37,934 --> 00:36:41,808
jump into a pick-up
and take off

787
00:36:41,938 --> 00:36:45,028
just before the garage
went up in flames.

788
00:36:45,159 --> 00:36:46,378
A red hoody

789
00:36:46,508 --> 00:36:48,162
with white print
on the front.

790
00:36:48,293 --> 00:36:49,903
Blue jeans,
work boots.

791
00:36:50,033 --> 00:36:50,556
Huh?

792
00:36:50,686 --> 00:36:53,950
It wasn't me, bro.

793
00:36:54,081 --> 00:36:56,823
We got a piece
of the sweatshirt.

794
00:36:56,953 --> 00:37:01,175
We got a warrant, too.

795
00:37:01,306 --> 00:37:02,568
We're going through
your place right now.

796
00:37:04,178 --> 00:37:05,875
We're going to
find it.

797
00:37:06,006 --> 00:37:07,703
We're going to find
that sweatshirt.

798
00:37:07,834 --> 00:37:09,096
My client
came down here

799
00:37:09,227 --> 00:37:10,228
as a show of good will.

800
00:37:10,358 --> 00:37:11,316
It's called
cooperation.

801
00:37:11,446 --> 00:37:13,579
If you're going to
make accusations

802
00:37:13,709 --> 00:37:15,581
without charging him,
we're done here.

803
00:37:15,711 --> 00:37:17,322
You threatened her
in front of everyone.

804
00:37:17,452 --> 00:37:18,975
You told her
you'd see her real soon.

805
00:37:19,106 --> 00:37:20,629
You waited for her
in the parking lot,

806
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:22,065
and you followed her.

807
00:37:22,196 --> 00:37:23,415
We got witnesses
for all of that,

808
00:37:23,545 --> 00:37:24,720
and guess what?

809
00:37:24,851 --> 00:37:26,331
You got no alibi!

810
00:37:26,461 --> 00:37:27,897
No one knows where
the hell you went

811
00:37:28,028 --> 00:37:29,986
after Kelly made you
look like a chump

812
00:37:30,117 --> 00:37:31,336
in front of all
your moron buddies.

813
00:37:31,466 --> 00:37:33,381
Mr. Rankin went for a drive
to cool off,

814
00:37:33,512 --> 00:37:34,730
just as he said.

815
00:37:34,861 --> 00:37:35,862
There you go.

816
00:37:38,908 --> 00:37:40,301
You killed my cat.

817
00:37:40,432 --> 00:37:41,737
Oh, yeah,
someone killed your cat?

818
00:37:41,868 --> 00:37:42,651
That's sweet,
because I hate cats.

819
00:37:43,435 --> 00:37:44,566
Oh, no...

820
00:37:45,654 --> 00:37:47,134
You murdered Kelly,
and you feel nothing!

821
00:37:47,265 --> 00:37:48,440
You feel no remorse, no regret!

822
00:37:48,570 --> 00:37:49,832
You feel nothing--

823
00:37:49,963 --> 00:37:50,703
Jamie, easy!
Enough, mcdowell!

824
00:37:50,833 --> 00:37:52,139
How dare you!

825
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:52,922
You want remorse?
Screw that.

826
00:37:53,053 --> 00:37:54,315
I'm glad the witch died!

827
00:37:54,446 --> 00:37:55,969
All I have to do
is put you in that room!

828
00:37:56,099 --> 00:37:56,796
Shut up!
Mcdowell!

829
00:37:56,926 --> 00:37:57,710
I will put you in that room!

830
00:37:57,840 --> 00:38:00,800
My office, now!

831
00:38:00,930 --> 00:38:01,888
Okay...

832
00:38:02,018 --> 00:38:04,934
That was way past
unprofessional.

833
00:38:05,065 --> 00:38:05,935
It was reckless.

834
00:38:06,066 --> 00:38:07,067
It was illegal!

835
00:38:08,547 --> 00:38:10,853
You're looking at
being suspended without pay!

836
00:38:10,984 --> 00:38:12,115
I know, I'm sorry.

837
00:38:12,246 --> 00:38:14,422
You're sorry?

838
00:38:14,553 --> 00:38:16,946
What the hell
were you thinking, detective?

839
00:38:17,077 --> 00:38:18,296
He murdered her!

840
00:38:18,426 --> 00:38:19,688
And you want him to walk

841
00:38:19,819 --> 00:38:20,950
because you screwed
with his rights?

842
00:38:21,647 --> 00:38:24,302
You beat him up
during an interrogation,

843
00:38:24,432 --> 00:38:25,607
in front of witnesses,

844
00:38:25,738 --> 00:38:27,087
in front of
his lawyer!

845
00:38:27,217 --> 00:38:28,436
He's not
going to walk?

846
00:38:28,567 --> 00:38:30,612
You're losing it,
detective.

847
00:38:30,743 --> 00:38:32,919
Look...

848
00:38:33,049 --> 00:38:34,268
Just sit down.

849
00:38:40,970 --> 00:38:45,932
Jamie, I know
how you feel.

850
00:38:46,062 --> 00:38:47,586
When my partner got killed,

851
00:38:47,716 --> 00:38:50,023
they dragged his greasy
scumbag murderer in here

852
00:38:50,153 --> 00:38:51,285
so I could question him.

853
00:38:51,416 --> 00:38:52,765
It was everything I could do

854
00:38:52,895 --> 00:38:54,244
not to strangle him
with my bare hands...

855
00:38:56,029 --> 00:38:57,509
But you have to be
a professional.

856
00:38:59,902 --> 00:39:01,643
So you know,

857
00:39:01,774 --> 00:39:02,992
ray rankin is suing US.

858
00:39:03,123 --> 00:39:05,778
Assault,
harassment.

859
00:39:05,908 --> 00:39:07,127
I'm sure he'll say
his rights were compromised

860
00:39:07,257 --> 00:39:08,215
if we bring charges.

861
00:39:08,346 --> 00:39:10,391
We'll see.

862
00:39:10,522 --> 00:39:12,480
Now, stay away
from this damn case.

863
00:39:24,623 --> 00:39:26,929
6958...

864
00:39:27,060 --> 00:39:29,802
6958, all right,
you've been very helpful.

865
00:39:29,932 --> 00:39:31,369
I appreciate it.

866
00:39:31,499 --> 00:39:33,458
Jogger
at the reservoir

867
00:39:33,588 --> 00:39:35,416
sees a bag of clothes
washed up in the bushes.

868
00:39:35,547 --> 00:39:37,113
Knows we're looking for
a red sweatshirt

869
00:39:37,244 --> 00:39:38,201
and blue jeans.

870
00:39:38,332 --> 00:39:39,377
Calls it in.

871
00:39:39,507 --> 00:39:42,510
Red sweatshirt,
blue jeans,

872
00:39:42,641 --> 00:39:44,425
smells of gasoline.

873
00:39:44,556 --> 00:39:45,644
I got to take up
jogging.

874
00:39:45,774 --> 00:39:48,124
Huh?

875
00:39:50,431 --> 00:39:57,438
I would rather
be lucky than good.

876
00:39:57,569 --> 00:40:00,702
Yeah, this is
detective dasher.

877
00:40:00,833 --> 00:40:03,270
Yeah...

878
00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:04,358
Yeah, I need
a back-up unit

879
00:40:04,489 --> 00:40:07,753
to assist
in a pick-up.

880
00:40:07,883 --> 00:40:09,189
All right.

881
00:40:09,319 --> 00:40:10,582
Yeah, 10 minutes
down there.

882
00:40:10,712 --> 00:40:13,019
I'll meet you
downstairs.

883
00:40:13,149 --> 00:40:14,934
Yeah...

884
00:40:16,588 --> 00:40:19,547
Jamie, we're going
to go pick him up.

885
00:40:19,678 --> 00:40:23,725
Jamie,
where are you going?

886
00:40:24,857 --> 00:40:25,858
Jamie, what...

887
00:40:25,988 --> 00:40:27,076
We got him,
what are you...

888
00:40:27,207 --> 00:40:28,513
Where are you
going?

889
00:40:28,643 --> 00:40:31,254
Just a sec.

890
00:40:35,650 --> 00:40:38,218
You want
something to drink?

891
00:40:39,698 --> 00:40:43,136
No, thanks.

892
00:40:43,266 --> 00:40:45,486
I'm going to
have a beer.

893
00:40:45,617 --> 00:40:47,749
You sure you don't
want anything?

894
00:40:54,190 --> 00:40:55,148
No, you go ahead.

895
00:41:13,079 --> 00:41:14,080
So, what's up?

896
00:41:16,996 --> 00:41:19,302
I need you to tell me again
about the night Kelly died.

897
00:41:19,433 --> 00:41:20,390
I told you what happened.

898
00:41:22,567 --> 00:41:24,394
I need you to tell me again.

899
00:41:24,525 --> 00:41:25,787
Okay...

900
00:41:25,918 --> 00:41:29,704
Um...

901
00:41:29,835 --> 00:41:32,968
We went to the copper penny,
and ray was there,

902
00:41:33,099 --> 00:41:33,926
and then when we--

903
00:41:34,056 --> 00:41:34,970
after that.

904
00:41:39,888 --> 00:41:42,630
Kelly...

905
00:41:42,761 --> 00:41:46,416
Kelly threw a beer
in Ray's face, and--

906
00:41:46,547 --> 00:41:47,635
after that.

907
00:41:47,766 --> 00:41:48,767
After she left,

908
00:41:48,897 --> 00:41:50,638
and you were there
drinking alone.

909
00:41:59,386 --> 00:42:00,518
I came home,

910
00:42:00,648 --> 00:42:03,433
and then I...

911
00:42:03,564 --> 00:42:04,652
Punched the wall,

912
00:42:04,783 --> 00:42:05,827
and I passed out.

913
00:42:07,525 --> 00:42:09,048
You tell me the truth.

914
00:42:13,095 --> 00:42:14,619
I told...
I told you the truth.

915
00:42:14,749 --> 00:42:17,970
I listened to
Kelly's message,

916
00:42:18,100 --> 00:42:24,063
I punched the wall,
and, uh...

917
00:42:24,193 --> 00:42:25,630
And then I went to bed.

918
00:42:28,241 --> 00:42:28,546
No, you didn't.

919
00:42:31,418 --> 00:42:32,375
Yes, I did.

920
00:42:35,770 --> 00:42:40,035
'Cause...

921
00:42:40,166 --> 00:42:41,689
'Cause my hand...

922
00:42:41,820 --> 00:42:44,562
You tell me the truth.

923
00:42:47,826 --> 00:42:50,611
My hand was...

924
00:42:50,742 --> 00:42:53,832
Killing me, and the room...

925
00:42:53,962 --> 00:42:57,052
The room was spinning,
and then I passed out.

926
00:43:03,972 --> 00:43:06,496
I passed out.

927
00:43:06,627 --> 00:43:08,890
We found the red sweatshirt.

928
00:43:12,677 --> 00:43:13,765
I don't...

929
00:43:45,666 --> 00:43:47,102
It's not... mine.

930
00:43:51,585 --> 00:43:52,934
Yes, it is.

931
00:43:56,416 --> 00:44:00,768
There's a lot of people
that have this...

932
00:44:00,899 --> 00:44:02,204
This sweatshirt.

933
00:44:02,335 --> 00:44:05,120
It has "pm" written on the tag.

934
00:44:07,819 --> 00:44:10,952
Peter mcdowell.

935
00:44:13,955 --> 00:44:14,739
I put it there.

936
00:44:34,802 --> 00:44:35,977
We found a gas can
in the garbage

937
00:44:36,108 --> 00:44:37,022
behind
the construction site

938
00:44:37,152 --> 00:44:38,110
at Peter's work.

939
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:40,547
It's at the lab
with his clothes.

940
00:44:40,678 --> 00:44:42,375
And we have semen
from the victim.

941
00:44:42,505 --> 00:44:44,159
Kelly.
Her name is Kelly.

942
00:44:44,290 --> 00:44:46,335
Kelly, sorry.

943
00:44:46,466 --> 00:44:47,859
We need
Peter's DNA.

944
00:44:49,991 --> 00:44:52,864
Well, I think he's sat in there
long enough.

945
00:44:52,994 --> 00:44:54,126
Why don't you
go in there

946
00:44:54,256 --> 00:44:55,475
and see what
you can get out of him?

947
00:44:55,605 --> 00:44:56,824
I want to talk to him first.

948
00:45:00,610 --> 00:45:02,830
Jamie...

949
00:45:02,961 --> 00:45:04,614
Paul, he's my son.

950
00:45:11,491 --> 00:45:12,448
All right, go ahead.

951
00:45:33,948 --> 00:45:35,994
It was a mistake
to bring me here.

952
00:45:36,908 --> 00:45:39,780
I didn't do it.

953
00:45:39,911 --> 00:45:40,912
Then tell them that.

954
00:45:41,042 --> 00:45:41,913
You tell
them that.

955
00:45:42,043 --> 00:45:42,740
You brought me here.

956
00:45:42,870 --> 00:45:45,177
You're my mother.

957
00:45:45,307 --> 00:45:47,266
If you're going to tell them,
they're going to believe you.

958
00:45:57,885 --> 00:45:59,800
Gasoline is like
a fingerprint,

959
00:45:59,931 --> 00:46:04,196
and they found gas
on your clothes,

960
00:46:04,326 --> 00:46:07,503
at your job...

961
00:46:09,201 --> 00:46:11,290
And at Kelly's house,

962
00:46:11,420 --> 00:46:18,601
and if it comes back a match,
it is a clear chain of evidence.

963
00:46:18,732 --> 00:46:22,562
I-I told you
already.

964
00:46:22,692 --> 00:46:26,696
I came home,
and I went to bed,

965
00:46:30,483 --> 00:46:34,661
and there's
the timeline.

966
00:46:34,792 --> 00:46:38,752
You got Kelly's message
at 12:15.

967
00:46:38,883 --> 00:46:40,623
I takes you 15 minutes
to get to her house.

968
00:46:40,754 --> 00:46:44,802
That puts it at 12:30.

969
00:46:44,932 --> 00:46:49,632
It wasn't me.

970
00:46:52,592 --> 00:46:57,815
I loved Kelly.

971
00:46:57,945 --> 00:46:59,642
Why can't you just believe me?

972
00:46:59,773 --> 00:47:00,730
I know you loved her.

973
00:47:13,918 --> 00:47:14,962
I want to believe

974
00:47:15,093 --> 00:47:16,877
that you went home
and went to bed,

975
00:47:17,008 --> 00:47:19,575
but that is not
how it's lining up,

976
00:47:19,706 --> 00:47:22,013
because you're not
telling me the truth.

977
00:47:22,143 --> 00:47:24,232
She's
interrogating him.

978
00:47:24,363 --> 00:47:25,190
Yeah,
and he's opening up.

979
00:47:25,320 --> 00:47:26,756
Just sit tight.

980
00:47:26,887 --> 00:47:28,236
How are any of US
supposed to believe

981
00:47:28,367 --> 00:47:29,716
that you didn't mean to do it,

982
00:47:29,847 --> 00:47:31,587
if you don't admit to doing it
in the first place?

983
00:47:38,768 --> 00:47:40,770
Peter,
what happened?

984
00:47:40,901 --> 00:47:42,642
What happened?

985
00:47:46,037 --> 00:47:50,258
Are you a detective...

986
00:47:56,786 --> 00:47:58,832
Or are you my mother?

987
00:48:00,790 --> 00:48:01,791
You heard the message...

988
00:48:05,012 --> 00:48:06,231
I need your help.

989
00:48:06,361 --> 00:48:08,276
Peter, tell me what happened.

990
00:48:09,930 --> 00:48:10,888
I can't do it.

991
00:48:11,018 --> 00:48:12,759
You went home...

992
00:48:12,890 --> 00:48:15,240
Mom, please...

993
00:48:15,370 --> 00:48:17,503
You heard the message...

994
00:48:17,633 --> 00:48:20,419
Please...

995
00:48:20,549 --> 00:48:21,942
Tell me
what happened.

996
00:48:22,073 --> 00:48:23,509
Why are you doing this to me?

997
00:48:23,639 --> 00:48:25,598
You went home.

998
00:48:25,728 --> 00:48:27,817
You heard
the message...

999
00:48:27,948 --> 00:48:28,949
Mom, please.

1000
00:48:29,080 --> 00:48:32,692
Please, please, please...

1001
00:48:32,822 --> 00:48:35,086
You went home,

1002
00:48:35,216 --> 00:48:37,392
you heard the message...

1003
00:48:37,523 --> 00:48:41,483
I loved Kelly.

1004
00:48:41,614 --> 00:48:42,832
I loved her
with all my heart.

1005
00:48:45,966 --> 00:48:47,011
You went home...

1006
00:48:48,099 --> 00:48:52,103
You heard
the message...

1007
00:49:03,636 --> 00:49:04,680
I got in the truck.

1008
00:49:12,862 --> 00:49:13,863
I got in the truck.

1009
00:49:16,562 --> 00:49:20,914
I got in the truck
because I had to see her.

1010
00:49:35,407 --> 00:49:36,321
Kelly?

1011
00:49:39,237 --> 00:49:39,933
Kelly...

1012
00:49:40,064 --> 00:49:42,327
Kelly, it's Peter.

1013
00:49:43,937 --> 00:49:44,938
Let me in.

1014
00:49:51,075 --> 00:49:53,077
I don't want
to see you anymore, okay?

1015
00:49:53,207 --> 00:49:54,252
Kelly...

1016
00:49:54,382 --> 00:49:55,731
I just...

1017
00:49:55,862 --> 00:49:57,081
I just want to talk to you,
that's all.

1018
00:49:57,211 --> 00:49:59,257
Just let me in.
Let me in your place.

1019
00:49:59,387 --> 00:50:00,693
You know what?

1020
00:50:00,823 --> 00:50:02,390
Ray was right
about you.

1021
00:50:02,521 --> 00:50:03,957
You're a mama's boy, Peter.

1022
00:50:04,088 --> 00:50:05,350
You always will be.

1023
00:50:05,480 --> 00:50:06,655
Kelly...

1024
00:50:06,786 --> 00:50:09,180
You don't
mean that.

1025
00:50:09,310 --> 00:50:11,573
Look,

1026
00:50:11,704 --> 00:50:13,619
so I didn't punch out

1027
00:50:13,749 --> 00:50:16,796
some loser
at the bar for you.

1028
00:50:16,926 --> 00:50:17,927
Kelly, there's nothing
I wouldn't do for you.

1029
00:50:18,058 --> 00:50:19,451
You have to believe me, Kelly.

1030
00:50:19,581 --> 00:50:21,322
We can fix this,
please--
no, okay?
We're over.

1031
00:50:21,453 --> 00:50:22,541
No, I just want
to talk to you, Kelly.

1032
00:50:22,671 --> 00:50:25,065
No!

1033
00:50:26,371 --> 00:50:27,285
Look what you did to my hand.

1034
00:50:27,415 --> 00:50:28,634
No.

1035
00:50:28,764 --> 00:50:30,244
I just want to talk to you,
Kelly.

1036
00:50:30,375 --> 00:50:31,724
No, Peter.
No!

1037
00:50:31,854 --> 00:50:32,681
Come on,
please, Kelly.

1038
00:50:32,812 --> 00:50:33,856
Just hear me out,
Kelly.

1039
00:50:33,987 --> 00:50:35,423
Oh!

1040
00:50:35,554 --> 00:50:36,294
Ah!

1041
00:50:40,124 --> 00:50:40,776
Ow, you're
hurting me!
Please!

1042
00:50:40,907 --> 00:50:41,125
Stop...

1043
00:50:41,255 --> 00:50:42,039
No!

1044
00:50:42,169 --> 00:50:43,997
Peter, don't!

1045
00:50:44,128 --> 00:50:45,042
Please! Kelly...

1046
00:50:45,172 --> 00:50:45,955
Stop it!

1047
00:50:51,048 --> 00:50:52,049
No...

1048
00:51:13,331 --> 00:51:14,332
Kelly?

1049
00:51:16,290 --> 00:51:18,031
Kelly. Kelly...

1050
00:51:21,339 --> 00:51:22,383
Kelly!

1051
00:51:22,514 --> 00:51:23,123
Kelly, Kelly, Kelly...

1052
00:51:23,254 --> 00:51:25,430
Kelly, I'm sorry.

1053
00:51:25,560 --> 00:51:26,126
I'm sorry.

1054
00:51:26,257 --> 00:51:28,259
Oh, god.
I'm sorry.

1055
00:51:28,389 --> 00:51:29,521
Kelly. Please.

1056
00:51:29,651 --> 00:51:32,001
Kelly, Kelly...

1057
00:51:41,228 --> 00:51:42,186
Kelly, no...

1058
00:51:43,404 --> 00:51:45,406
Oh, my god.
Oh, my god...

1059
00:51:45,537 --> 00:51:47,626
Kelly, Kelly...

1060
00:51:48,888 --> 00:51:52,283
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

1061
00:51:56,243 --> 00:51:58,071
Oh, god!

1062
00:51:58,202 --> 00:51:59,681
What am I going to do?

1063
00:51:59,812 --> 00:52:00,900
Okay...

1064
00:53:22,024 --> 00:53:25,767
Will you prosecute him?

1065
00:53:25,898 --> 00:53:27,465
Uh...

1066
00:53:27,595 --> 00:53:28,901
People know
I've been seeing you.

1067
00:53:29,031 --> 00:53:30,032
I recused myself.

1068
00:53:36,256 --> 00:53:39,825
The d.A. Is deferring
to the Attorney General.

1069
00:53:47,833 --> 00:53:49,051
I don't like the a.G.

1070
00:53:50,488 --> 00:53:52,620
He's going for
the death penalty.

1071
00:53:56,102 --> 00:53:56,972
He can't do that.

1072
00:53:57,103 --> 00:53:58,365
Well...

1073
00:53:58,496 --> 00:54:01,020
There are three
aggravated circumstances.

1074
00:54:01,150 --> 00:54:03,152
And several mitigating ones.

1075
00:54:06,852 --> 00:54:10,159
Unfortunately,
he can't ignore, uh...

1076
00:54:10,290 --> 00:54:11,509
Arson, rape...

1077
00:54:12,292 --> 00:54:15,600
Murder.

1078
00:54:19,821 --> 00:54:22,259
But he doesn't have
a criminal record.

1079
00:54:30,528 --> 00:54:33,661
Well, he's
being booked.

1080
00:54:33,792 --> 00:54:34,575
They're arraigning him
later today.

1081
00:54:34,706 --> 00:54:37,883
Attorney General's
asking no bail.

1082
00:54:38,013 --> 00:54:40,668
Violent nature of the crime...

1083
00:54:43,105 --> 00:54:45,717
So, who's
defending him?

1084
00:54:45,847 --> 00:54:47,240
Jamie...

1085
00:54:47,371 --> 00:54:49,068
Do you have someone
to defend Peter?

1086
00:54:49,198 --> 00:54:50,287
Um...

1087
00:54:54,769 --> 00:54:55,901
I don't know yet.

1088
00:54:56,031 --> 00:54:56,989
I-I don't...

1089
00:54:58,686 --> 00:55:01,123
You know what,
I'll give you a list of names,

1090
00:55:01,254 --> 00:55:02,386
all right?

1091
00:55:02,516 --> 00:55:04,257
Okay.

1092
00:55:04,388 --> 00:55:05,519
Look, Jamie,

1093
00:55:05,650 --> 00:55:07,260
would you like to take
some time off?

1094
00:55:07,391 --> 00:55:09,610
What?

1095
00:55:09,741 --> 00:55:11,656
I mean, it's your call.

1096
00:55:15,573 --> 00:55:18,097
Um, maybe, I don't know.

1097
00:55:18,227 --> 00:55:19,141
I-I don't...

1098
00:55:19,272 --> 00:55:20,969
I don't know.

1099
00:55:27,062 --> 00:55:28,107
So, what's going on?

1100
00:55:28,237 --> 00:55:29,500
Was there an arrest?

1101
00:55:42,339 --> 00:55:43,078
Yeah.

1102
00:55:43,209 --> 00:55:46,778
Did you get him?

1103
00:55:46,908 --> 00:55:48,083
Did you get ray?

1104
00:55:48,214 --> 00:55:49,476
It wasn't him.

1105
00:55:52,610 --> 00:55:54,438
Then who was it?

1106
00:55:58,746 --> 00:56:01,662
Jamie?

1107
00:56:01,793 --> 00:56:03,055
Who did it?

1108
00:56:09,540 --> 00:56:11,411
It was Peter.

1109
00:56:14,675 --> 00:56:15,720
What?

1110
00:56:16,547 --> 00:56:18,679
My Peter killed Kelly.

1111
00:56:20,986 --> 00:56:21,813
That...

1112
00:56:21,943 --> 00:56:23,510
That's not true.
It can't be true.

1113
00:56:23,641 --> 00:56:27,340
Susan...

1114
00:56:27,471 --> 00:56:29,603
Susan, he confessed.

1115
00:56:29,734 --> 00:56:31,344
Oh, my...

1116
00:56:31,475 --> 00:56:35,174
Oh, my god.

1117
00:56:35,304 --> 00:56:37,437
Oh, my...

1118
00:56:38,438 --> 00:56:40,309
He...

1119
00:56:40,440 --> 00:56:41,528
He raped her?

1120
00:56:44,357 --> 00:56:45,924
He strangled her,
is that's what you're saying?

1121
00:56:47,839 --> 00:56:49,449
Oh, god...

1122
00:56:54,541 --> 00:56:57,501
They got into
a fight

1123
00:56:57,631 --> 00:56:58,937
at the bar.

1124
00:56:59,067 --> 00:57:00,373
She wanted to break it off
with him.

1125
00:57:02,897 --> 00:57:03,855
She was breaking it off?

1126
00:57:03,985 --> 00:57:08,076
He was angry,

1127
00:57:08,207 --> 00:57:09,208
and he was very drunk.

1128
00:57:13,038 --> 00:57:14,169
He wanted
to talk to her.

1129
00:57:14,300 --> 00:57:17,390
He just wanted to talk to her.

1130
00:57:19,087 --> 00:57:22,264
He just wanted
to talk to her.

1131
00:57:22,395 --> 00:57:23,440
It's so hard to understand.

1132
00:57:25,746 --> 00:57:27,400
No, it's not.

1133
00:57:27,531 --> 00:57:29,837
She was
breaking it off,

1134
00:57:29,968 --> 00:57:31,186
so he...

1135
00:57:31,317 --> 00:57:32,492
He killed her.

1136
00:57:32,623 --> 00:57:34,146
He raped her,
he murdered her,

1137
00:57:34,276 --> 00:57:35,669
and he...

1138
00:57:35,800 --> 00:57:37,628
Lit her on fire to cover it up.

1139
00:57:37,758 --> 00:57:39,368
He was drunk.

1140
00:57:39,499 --> 00:57:40,413
They were both very,
very drunk.

1141
00:57:42,023 --> 00:57:43,634
You're saying
it's okay to kill my baby

1142
00:57:43,764 --> 00:57:44,504
because they were drunk?

1143
00:57:44,635 --> 00:57:47,638
Are you trying
to justify it?

1144
00:57:47,768 --> 00:57:49,074
No! No...

1145
00:57:49,204 --> 00:57:51,903
You think it's excusable
because they were both drunk?

1146
00:57:52,033 --> 00:57:52,904
That's not what I'm saying.

1147
00:57:53,034 --> 00:57:54,296
Kelly is dead!

1148
00:57:54,427 --> 00:57:56,037
Kelly is dead,

1149
00:57:56,168 --> 00:57:57,474
and Peter killed her!

1150
00:57:57,604 --> 00:58:01,347
That's inexcusable.

1151
00:58:01,478 --> 00:58:03,262
That's unforgivable!

1152
00:58:06,352 --> 00:58:08,441
Oh, god...

1153
00:58:12,401 --> 00:58:13,664
Get out of my house.

1154
00:58:13,794 --> 00:58:15,100
Get out.

1155
00:58:19,626 --> 00:58:21,106
Get out of my house!

1156
00:58:27,199 --> 00:58:28,853
Oh, god...

1157
00:58:30,681 --> 00:58:32,552
No...

1158
00:58:32,683 --> 00:58:34,859
No...

1159
00:58:54,574 --> 00:58:56,663
I came home,

1160
00:58:56,794 --> 00:58:57,795
and then I...

1161
00:58:57,925 --> 00:59:01,363
Punched the wall,
and I passed out.

1162
00:59:09,154 --> 00:59:11,678
My hand was...

1163
00:59:11,809 --> 00:59:13,724
Killing me, and...

1164
00:59:13,854 --> 00:59:15,508
The room...

1165
00:59:15,639 --> 00:59:17,466
The room was spinning,
and then I passed out.

1166
00:59:20,861 --> 00:59:22,515
There are three
aggravating circumstances.

1167
00:59:25,910 --> 00:59:27,868
He's going for
the death penalty.

1168
00:59:36,964 --> 00:59:39,532
Are you a detective
or are you my mother?

1169
00:59:42,535 --> 00:59:43,623
Because you need to help me.

1170
00:59:43,754 --> 00:59:44,537
Help me.

1171
01:00:10,302 --> 01:00:11,608
Hey, can I talk to you
for a second?

1172
01:00:11,738 --> 01:00:13,610
I need to talk to you too.

1173
01:00:13,740 --> 01:00:14,915
I hired
an attorney.

1174
01:00:15,046 --> 01:00:15,916
Oh, that's good.
Who?

1175
01:00:19,137 --> 01:00:19,920
Ed Callaghan.

1176
01:00:20,051 --> 01:00:21,269
What?

1177
01:00:21,400 --> 01:00:22,444
Ed Callaghan.

1178
01:00:22,575 --> 01:00:24,055
No, I heard you
the first time.

1179
01:00:24,185 --> 01:00:26,666
What I meant to say was what
the hell did you do that for?

1180
01:00:26,797 --> 01:00:28,407
Because the ag's
going for the death penalty.

1181
01:00:29,713 --> 01:00:31,192
Ed Callaghan
defends cop killers.

1182
01:00:31,323 --> 01:00:32,411
He likes defending cop killers.

1183
01:00:32,541 --> 01:00:33,847
You can't hire him.

1184
01:00:34,718 --> 01:00:36,328
Every cop on the force,
including me,

1185
01:00:36,458 --> 01:00:38,809
will take offense.

1186
01:00:38,939 --> 01:00:40,419
Well, let me
ask you this.

1187
01:00:40,549 --> 01:00:41,420
What if were your son?

1188
01:00:41,550 --> 01:00:42,813
He's a dirtbag. It's a bad move.

1189
01:00:42,943 --> 01:00:44,945
Yeah, you're right,
he is a dirtbag,

1190
01:00:45,076 --> 01:00:46,164
and he also costs a fortune.

1191
01:00:46,294 --> 01:00:47,687
So you're making my case?

1192
01:00:47,818 --> 01:00:50,559
No, I'm claiming
that reward money.

1193
01:00:50,690 --> 01:00:53,171
You expect me
to hand over 10 grand

1194
01:00:53,301 --> 01:00:54,607
for bringing in
your own son,

1195
01:00:54,738 --> 01:00:56,174
so you can turn around and
hand it over to ed Callaghan?

1196
01:00:56,304 --> 01:00:57,131
That's not
going to happen.

1197
01:00:57,262 --> 01:00:58,742
I'm not
asking you.

1198
01:00:58,872 --> 01:00:59,699
Police money
is not going,

1199
01:00:59,830 --> 01:01:02,876
it will never go
to ed Callaghan.

1200
01:01:03,007 --> 01:01:04,661
It's not police money.
It's my money.

1201
01:01:04,791 --> 01:01:06,271
We both know

1202
01:01:06,401 --> 01:01:07,533
that the only way
this case is clean

1203
01:01:07,664 --> 01:01:08,752
is if I bring him in
as a mother.

1204
01:01:08,882 --> 01:01:10,884
There is no way

1205
01:01:11,015 --> 01:01:15,236
I'm letting you
do this.

1206
01:01:15,367 --> 01:01:18,196
You want me
to say it?

1207
01:01:18,326 --> 01:01:20,589
I'll sue you
for it, Paul.

1208
01:01:20,720 --> 01:01:21,939
Child molesters,
drug dealers,

1209
01:01:22,069 --> 01:01:23,331
and cop killers,

1210
01:01:23,462 --> 01:01:25,159
that's who you want
to be in bed with, huh?

1211
01:01:25,290 --> 01:01:27,205
Why are you acting
like I have a choice?

1212
01:01:27,335 --> 01:01:30,687
Ray rankin is suing everyone
in the whole damn county!

1213
01:01:34,255 --> 01:01:35,561
Well, that's no surprise,
is it?

1214
01:01:35,692 --> 01:01:38,607
No, but it doesn't make it
any easier to swallow, does it?

1215
01:01:38,738 --> 01:01:39,870
He's asking for
a ton of damages.

1216
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,699
The papers are going
to run with this for weeks.

1217
01:01:42,829 --> 01:01:45,527
It's bad press,
mcdowell.

1218
01:01:45,658 --> 01:01:47,704
It's bad for you,
it's bad for the department,

1219
01:01:47,834 --> 01:01:49,227
and it's bad for me.

1220
01:01:50,837 --> 01:01:52,186
That's not what I wanted,
and you know it.

1221
01:01:52,317 --> 01:01:53,492
I know,

1222
01:01:53,622 --> 01:01:55,886
and I'm sorry,
but you leave me with no choice.

1223
01:01:56,016 --> 01:01:57,278
I have to suspend you.

1224
01:01:59,237 --> 01:02:01,282
Leave
your weapon.

1225
01:02:05,286 --> 01:02:06,723
I want that money.

1226
01:02:14,643 --> 01:02:15,601
Jamie!

1227
01:02:15,732 --> 01:02:17,516
Jamie, what's up?

1228
01:02:17,646 --> 01:02:19,648
Huh?

1229
01:02:19,779 --> 01:02:21,825
I'm suspended.

1230
01:02:23,435 --> 01:02:23,696
What?

1231
01:02:29,528 --> 01:02:30,659
And I hired
ed Callaghan

1232
01:02:30,790 --> 01:02:31,922
to represent Peter,

1233
01:02:32,052 --> 01:02:33,662
and I want you
to tell you myself

1234
01:02:33,793 --> 01:02:34,576
before anybody else
tells you, all right?

1235
01:02:34,707 --> 01:02:35,534
I told you.

1236
01:02:35,664 --> 01:02:36,883
Yeah, I understand.

1237
01:02:37,014 --> 01:02:38,232
Look, you're going to lose
a lot of friends.

1238
01:02:38,363 --> 01:02:39,320
You know that, right?

1239
01:02:40,626 --> 01:02:40,887
Then they weren't friends
to begin with.

1240
01:02:41,018 --> 01:02:43,020
All I'm saying is

1241
01:02:43,150 --> 01:02:45,457
that maybe you ought to
sleep on it a night

1242
01:02:45,587 --> 01:02:48,155
before you go ahead
and do that.

1243
01:02:48,286 --> 01:02:49,983
You want me to sleep on it?

1244
01:02:50,114 --> 01:02:52,769
You want me to sleep on it?

1245
01:02:52,899 --> 01:02:53,813
I don't sleep anymore.

1246
01:02:53,944 --> 01:02:55,728
I don't sleep
anymore.

1247
01:02:55,859 --> 01:02:56,642
There's no sleep for me.

1248
01:02:56,773 --> 01:02:58,426
None.

1249
01:02:58,557 --> 01:02:59,514
I didn't know you smoked.

1250
01:02:59,645 --> 01:03:01,952
Yeah, I don't.

1251
01:03:02,082 --> 01:03:02,866
Jamie!

1252
01:03:02,996 --> 01:03:05,651
I'm fine.

1253
01:03:08,175 --> 01:03:09,873
God...

1254
01:03:10,003 --> 01:03:11,135
Darn it.

1255
01:03:15,313 --> 01:03:17,228
So the foundation's
still good,

1256
01:03:17,358 --> 01:03:18,707
but as far as
the house goes,

1257
01:03:18,838 --> 01:03:20,492
going to knock it down,
start from scratch.

1258
01:03:21,232 --> 01:03:22,494
Uh, we can possibly
start this week,

1259
01:03:22,624 --> 01:03:23,843
but for sure
next week.

1260
01:03:23,974 --> 01:03:25,018
Prices--

1261
01:03:25,149 --> 01:03:26,454
hang on a second.

1262
01:03:26,585 --> 01:03:26,803
Certainly.

1263
01:03:33,026 --> 01:03:36,334
I read about you
in the paper.

1264
01:03:36,464 --> 01:03:37,639
Do you think the world
feels sorry for you

1265
01:03:37,770 --> 01:03:38,727
now that you've been suspended?

1266
01:03:40,991 --> 01:03:42,253
What do you want me to say?

1267
01:03:42,383 --> 01:03:44,821
I don't want you
to say anything.

1268
01:03:44,951 --> 01:03:48,476
I want you to listen
and think.

1269
01:03:48,607 --> 01:03:49,695
Think about all
the lives Peter ended.

1270
01:03:50,609 --> 01:03:51,784
Not just Kelly's,

1271
01:03:51,915 --> 01:03:53,960
but mine,

1272
01:03:54,091 --> 01:03:55,744
my family's,

1273
01:03:55,875 --> 01:03:58,617
all of my friends,
all of Kelly's friends.

1274
01:03:58,747 --> 01:03:59,705
We will never be the same.

1275
01:03:59,836 --> 01:04:01,359
You think I will?

1276
01:04:01,489 --> 01:04:02,751
I think you've lost your mind!

1277
01:04:04,318 --> 01:04:05,798
How dare you claim
that reward money

1278
01:04:05,929 --> 01:04:08,235
to defend
Peter?

1279
01:04:08,366 --> 01:04:09,541
Susan, you'd do the same.

1280
01:04:09,671 --> 01:04:10,977
Peter
killed Kelly!

1281
01:04:11,108 --> 01:04:12,892
He deserves to pay for that
with his life.

1282
01:04:13,023 --> 01:04:15,634
You need to feel
what I feel.

1283
01:04:15,764 --> 01:04:16,896
That's justice!

1284
01:04:36,394 --> 01:04:37,525
Look, if this
is going to be

1285
01:04:37,656 --> 01:04:38,787
a problem for you,
detective mcdowell,

1286
01:04:38,918 --> 01:04:41,007
you can always get
yourself another attorney.

1287
01:04:41,138 --> 01:04:44,315
I'm here
for my son.

1288
01:04:44,445 --> 01:04:45,707
I highly doubt
we're going to be friends.

1289
01:04:45,838 --> 01:04:46,795
All right?

1290
01:04:46,926 --> 01:04:49,320
Oh, I imagine we won't be.

1291
01:04:49,450 --> 01:04:51,800
Now, I already spoke to
the Attorney General's office,

1292
01:04:51,931 --> 01:04:52,889
told them
I'd be representing Peter.

1293
01:04:54,194 --> 01:04:56,457
I'm sure they were thrilled.

1294
01:04:56,588 --> 01:04:58,938
Not really.

1295
01:04:59,069 --> 01:05:00,635
We're meeting with judge waller
this afternoon.

1296
01:05:00,766 --> 01:05:02,246
What do you mean,
this afternoon?

1297
01:05:04,422 --> 01:05:05,989
Well...

1298
01:05:06,119 --> 01:05:07,686
The child of a birch hills
police detective

1299
01:05:07,816 --> 01:05:09,818
violently rapes, murders,

1300
01:05:09,949 --> 01:05:12,256
and burns a
local young woman.

1301
01:05:12,386 --> 01:05:12,909
Now, that's
what you call

1302
01:05:13,039 --> 01:05:15,128
a very public,

1303
01:05:15,259 --> 01:05:16,956
very high profile
death penalty case.

1304
01:05:17,087 --> 01:05:17,914
Top priority for the a.G.

1305
01:05:18,044 --> 01:05:20,133
Oh, he thinks

1306
01:05:20,264 --> 01:05:21,395
he's going to
win this one big.

1307
01:05:21,526 --> 01:05:22,527
In fact,
he's sure of it.

1308
01:05:22,657 --> 01:05:23,876
And what do you think?

1309
01:05:24,007 --> 01:05:25,486
I think all the evidence
is against US,

1310
01:05:25,617 --> 01:05:27,662
and there's a confession.

1311
01:05:27,793 --> 01:05:29,099
I think we're going to lose.

1312
01:05:29,229 --> 01:05:32,667
Well, guess what,
I'm not paying you to lose.

1313
01:05:32,798 --> 01:05:33,842
Well, regardless,
we're going to lose.

1314
01:05:33,973 --> 01:05:35,322
We expect to lose.

1315
01:05:35,453 --> 01:05:36,497
We're not even trying to win.

1316
01:05:36,628 --> 01:05:38,369
Well, then, what are...

1317
01:05:38,499 --> 01:05:40,414
I don't...
What are we doing here?

1318
01:05:40,545 --> 01:05:42,764
What are we doing?
What are we doing here--

1319
01:05:42,895 --> 01:05:46,159
we are trying to avoid
the death penalty.

1320
01:05:46,290 --> 01:05:48,379
Okay?

1321
01:05:48,509 --> 01:05:49,380
Peter's
going to jail

1322
01:05:49,510 --> 01:05:50,598
for the rest
of his life

1323
01:05:50,729 --> 01:05:51,991
is what
we're shooting for,

1324
01:05:52,122 --> 01:05:54,472
because what's
the alternative?

1325
01:05:54,602 --> 01:05:57,301
The alternative is
they strap him to a gurney,

1326
01:05:57,431 --> 01:05:58,345
they inject him

1327
01:05:58,476 --> 01:06:00,086
with sodium
thiopental,

1328
01:06:00,217 --> 01:06:01,609
pancuronium
bromide,

1329
01:06:01,740 --> 01:06:03,089
and potassium
chloride,

1330
01:06:03,220 --> 01:06:04,961
and his life ends
right before your eyes.

1331
01:06:09,487 --> 01:06:10,792
Am I wrong, detective?

1332
01:06:10,923 --> 01:06:12,620
Is that not
what we're trying to do here?

1333
01:06:12,751 --> 01:06:15,145
Save a murderer's
life?

1334
01:06:16,320 --> 01:06:19,149
My god.

1335
01:06:19,279 --> 01:06:22,195
You're crueler than I thought.

1336
01:06:22,326 --> 01:06:25,242
That's why people come to me.

1337
01:06:25,372 --> 01:06:28,071
People just like your son.

1338
01:06:28,201 --> 01:06:30,160
Do we understand each other?

1339
01:06:31,204 --> 01:06:33,467
Yeah.

1340
01:06:50,093 --> 01:06:52,051
I'm ed Callaghan.

1341
01:06:52,182 --> 01:06:55,011
Your mother hired me
to defend you.

1342
01:06:55,141 --> 01:06:57,317
We are going to save your life.

1343
01:07:09,329 --> 01:07:12,115
Did you kill
your mother's cat?

1344
01:07:12,245 --> 01:07:13,290
Yes.

1345
01:07:13,420 --> 01:07:14,639
Why?

1346
01:07:14,769 --> 01:07:15,770
Because
I wanted her to think

1347
01:07:15,901 --> 01:07:17,816
that rankin was trying
to scare her off.

1348
01:07:17,946 --> 01:07:18,860
You knew she'd
go after him

1349
01:07:18,991 --> 01:07:19,905
even harder.

1350
01:07:21,341 --> 01:07:22,342
Yeah, something like that.

1351
01:07:23,256 --> 01:07:25,215
So, uh...

1352
01:07:25,345 --> 01:07:27,826
We'll say that
it was simply a continuation

1353
01:07:27,956 --> 01:07:28,914
of your moral confusion,

1354
01:07:29,045 --> 01:07:31,090
that it wasn't
an act of deception,

1355
01:07:31,221 --> 01:07:33,701
but rather part and parcel
of this crime of passion.

1356
01:07:33,832 --> 01:07:34,876
Okay, that's...

1357
01:07:35,007 --> 01:07:35,877
So we got that one.

1358
01:07:36,008 --> 01:07:37,923
So let's go back now.

1359
01:07:38,054 --> 01:07:40,186
Um, Kelly Shaw
left you at the bar,

1360
01:07:40,317 --> 01:07:41,579
got in a cab,

1361
01:07:41,709 --> 01:07:43,450
and you did what?

1362
01:07:43,581 --> 01:07:44,538
I went back into the bar.

1363
01:07:44,669 --> 01:07:46,714
Stop.

1364
01:07:46,845 --> 01:07:48,325
Every sentence that
you utter on that stand

1365
01:07:48,455 --> 01:07:50,240
must begin with a disclaimer.

1366
01:07:50,370 --> 01:07:53,069
At no point are you to appear
certain of yourself

1367
01:07:53,199 --> 01:07:54,287
or of your story.

1368
01:07:54,418 --> 01:07:56,202
But I know what happened--

1369
01:07:56,333 --> 01:07:58,291
no, no, no, the facts are all
very sketchy to you now.

1370
01:07:58,422 --> 01:07:59,031
They're fading
into the background

1371
01:07:59,162 --> 01:08:01,251
like some old
photograph

1372
01:08:01,381 --> 01:08:03,035
you can hardly see.

1373
01:08:03,166 --> 01:08:04,993
Yeah, well,
I can see that old photograph

1374
01:08:05,124 --> 01:08:06,604
because it keeps playing
in my head,

1375
01:08:06,734 --> 01:08:08,432
over and over
and over,

1376
01:08:08,562 --> 01:08:10,042
and it doesn't stop.

1377
01:08:10,173 --> 01:08:11,043
You make it stop.

1378
01:08:11,174 --> 01:08:14,307
Tell me again.

1379
01:08:14,438 --> 01:08:17,049
Kelly left you at the bar,
and what happened after that?

1380
01:08:19,138 --> 01:08:20,183
I don't remember.

1381
01:08:20,313 --> 01:08:22,054
Good boy.

1382
01:08:22,185 --> 01:08:23,925
I think...

1383
01:08:24,056 --> 01:08:26,014
I went back into the bar

1384
01:08:26,145 --> 01:08:27,364
and had a...

1385
01:08:27,494 --> 01:08:28,452
A couple of beers,

1386
01:08:28,582 --> 01:08:29,453
I don't know,
maybe some shooters.

1387
01:08:29,583 --> 01:08:30,497
And then what?

1388
01:08:30,628 --> 01:08:32,934
I can't be sure anymore.

1389
01:08:33,065 --> 01:08:35,154
Very nice, very nice.

1390
01:08:35,285 --> 01:08:36,808
I think
I went home

1391
01:08:36,938 --> 01:08:39,506
and listened
to Kelly's message.

1392
01:08:42,030 --> 01:08:43,771
I don't know,
this is really confusing me.

1393
01:08:43,902 --> 01:08:44,729
Oh, of course
it is,

1394
01:08:44,859 --> 01:08:45,817
of course
it is,

1395
01:08:45,947 --> 01:08:47,471
and after that, you did what?

1396
01:08:47,601 --> 01:08:48,080
I drove to Kelly's--

1397
01:08:48,211 --> 01:08:49,125
no.

1398
01:08:51,605 --> 01:08:53,085
That's what I did.

1399
01:08:53,216 --> 01:08:54,782
No, it doesn't matter
what you did or didn't do.

1400
01:08:54,913 --> 01:08:56,349
All that matters now

1401
01:08:56,480 --> 01:08:58,308
is that the jury finds
a mitigating circumstance--

1402
01:08:58,438 --> 01:08:59,874
but I deserve death.

1403
01:09:00,005 --> 01:09:02,660
Just stop being so stupid and
just do what he tells you to do.

1404
01:09:04,444 --> 01:09:06,403
Now, we have to cast doubt
on the confession.

1405
01:09:06,533 --> 01:09:07,795
We have to
cast doubt on Kelly.

1406
01:09:07,926 --> 01:09:08,840
What?

1407
01:09:08,970 --> 01:09:10,146
Yeah, her character's
in question.

1408
01:09:10,276 --> 01:09:11,538
No, it's not.

1409
01:09:11,669 --> 01:09:13,105
Oh, yes,
she used you.

1410
01:09:13,236 --> 01:09:14,193
She used you as
emotional leverage

1411
01:09:14,324 --> 01:09:15,977
against Mr. Rankin,

1412
01:09:16,108 --> 01:09:17,153
with whom she'd recently
broken off her engagement.

1413
01:09:17,283 --> 01:09:18,589
Stop it.

1414
01:09:18,719 --> 01:09:20,721
She lied to you--that is enough.

1415
01:09:20,852 --> 01:09:22,549
She used you,
and she ultimately brought you

1416
01:09:22,680 --> 01:09:24,508
to this point
of blind rage.
Enough.

1417
01:09:24,638 --> 01:09:26,945
She's as much to blame
for this as you are.

1418
01:09:27,075 --> 01:09:28,729
No one deserves
what I did to Kelly.

1419
01:09:28,860 --> 01:09:30,688
Likewise, the jury
has to be made to believe

1420
01:09:30,818 --> 01:09:31,732
that you are
as much a victim

1421
01:09:31,863 --> 01:09:32,777
as she is.

1422
01:09:32,907 --> 01:09:33,952
I killed her!

1423
01:09:34,082 --> 01:09:35,432
She was
asking for it!

1424
01:09:35,562 --> 01:09:37,434
That's the picture we're
going to present to the court.

1425
01:09:37,564 --> 01:09:38,696
Your innocence
was no match

1426
01:09:38,826 --> 01:09:39,653
for her emotional
prevarications.

1427
01:09:39,784 --> 01:09:41,829
Okay, that's it,
you get out.

1428
01:09:41,960 --> 01:09:43,135
Your, uh, misguided,
blind love for her--

1429
01:09:43,266 --> 01:09:45,703
get him out of here.

1430
01:09:45,833 --> 01:09:47,270
...led to this spontaneous act
of passionate violence--

1431
01:09:47,400 --> 01:09:48,749
what the hell
is going on?

1432
01:09:48,880 --> 01:09:50,708
...resulting in the unfortunate
death of Kelly Shaw.

1433
01:09:50,838 --> 01:09:52,710
She brought it on herself--

1434
01:09:52,840 --> 01:09:54,015
it was manslaughter,
not murder.

1435
01:09:54,146 --> 01:09:55,103
Get the hell out of here!

1436
01:09:55,234 --> 01:09:56,148
Don't you get it?

1437
01:09:56,279 --> 01:09:58,194
I'm finished.

1438
01:09:58,324 --> 01:10:01,109
It's over.

1439
01:10:02,285 --> 01:10:03,373
I don't want to live.

1440
01:10:05,679 --> 01:10:07,290
So you can save your time, okay?

1441
01:10:07,420 --> 01:10:09,683
And even if I did
want to live,

1442
01:10:09,814 --> 01:10:11,772
you think
I would want to go in there,

1443
01:10:11,903 --> 01:10:13,992
to that litter box
with all those animals?

1444
01:10:19,084 --> 01:10:22,566
You tell them.

1445
01:10:22,696 --> 01:10:24,611
I want death.

1446
01:10:37,668 --> 01:10:39,060
Dr. Post,

1447
01:10:39,191 --> 01:10:40,105
you are the king county
medical examiner?

1448
01:10:40,236 --> 01:10:41,759
That's correct.

1449
01:10:41,889 --> 01:10:44,152
You examined Kelly Shaw's body
the morning after the murder?

1450
01:10:44,283 --> 01:10:45,850
Yes, I did.

1451
01:10:45,980 --> 01:10:47,068
Do your findings
coincide

1452
01:10:47,199 --> 01:10:48,244
with the defendant's
confession?

1453
01:10:48,374 --> 01:10:50,158
Yes, they do.

1454
01:10:50,289 --> 01:10:51,290
Miss Shaw was strangled to death

1455
01:10:51,421 --> 01:10:52,900
during forced
sexual intercourse,

1456
01:10:53,031 --> 01:10:55,251
and her body
was then burned

1457
01:10:55,381 --> 01:10:57,035
using gasoline as a fuel source
for the fire.

1458
01:10:57,165 --> 01:10:59,429
I see.

1459
01:10:59,559 --> 01:11:00,908
Were there semen samples,
or fingerprints,

1460
01:11:01,039 --> 01:11:02,475
or any other
crime scene evidence

1461
01:11:02,606 --> 01:11:04,172
that could lead to
DNA confirmation

1462
01:11:04,303 --> 01:11:05,173
of the defendant's
confession?

1463
01:11:05,304 --> 01:11:06,436
Yes.

1464
01:11:06,566 --> 01:11:07,915
There were
semen samples,

1465
01:11:08,046 --> 01:11:09,134
and fingerprints

1466
01:11:09,265 --> 01:11:10,701
on miss Shaw's
neck and body,

1467
01:11:10,831 --> 01:11:12,050
and the defendant's
clothing was found

1468
01:11:12,180 --> 01:11:15,575
both near the reservoir
and at the crime scene.

1469
01:11:15,706 --> 01:11:17,011
Can you tell the jury
your findings

1470
01:11:17,142 --> 01:11:19,405
after testing
the evidence?

1471
01:11:19,536 --> 01:11:20,711
All the tested
evidence

1472
01:11:20,841 --> 01:11:23,844
was a direct DNA match
for Mr. Mcdowell.

1473
01:11:23,975 --> 01:11:25,759
The semen,
the fingerprints,

1474
01:11:25,890 --> 01:11:28,545
and the clothing
all belong to the defendant.

1475
01:11:28,675 --> 01:11:30,982
So it's reasonable to conclude

1476
01:11:31,112 --> 01:11:33,114
that as his confession states,

1477
01:11:33,245 --> 01:11:34,768
Mr. Mcdowell raped, murdered,

1478
01:11:34,899 --> 01:11:36,770
and burned
miss Shaw?

1479
01:11:37,423 --> 01:11:38,598
I just want to
talk to you, Kelly.

1480
01:11:38,729 --> 01:11:40,339
No. Stop it.

1481
01:11:40,470 --> 01:11:42,080
Ah!

1482
01:11:42,210 --> 01:11:45,301
No, Peter!

1483
01:11:45,431 --> 01:11:47,433
Police look for
unimpeachable evidence,

1484
01:11:47,564 --> 01:11:50,044
evidence that links the
accused to the crime

1485
01:11:50,175 --> 01:11:51,524
without question.

1486
01:11:51,655 --> 01:11:54,527
Sometimes
we get luckier than others.

1487
01:11:54,658 --> 01:11:57,095
What about this time?

1488
01:11:57,225 --> 01:11:59,271
Even without Mr.
mcdowell's confession,

1489
01:11:59,402 --> 01:12:01,447
the evidence is irrefutable.

1490
01:12:01,578 --> 01:12:02,927
Nothing further.

1491
01:12:05,886 --> 01:12:07,323
Is that the case?

1492
01:12:15,026 --> 01:12:17,811
Just off the top of
your head, detective,

1493
01:12:17,942 --> 01:12:19,030
do you happen to know

1494
01:12:19,160 --> 01:12:21,032
what percentage of
death penalty cases

1495
01:12:21,162 --> 01:12:24,688
have been overturned
since 1977?

1496
01:12:24,818 --> 01:12:26,254
No, I do not.

1497
01:12:26,385 --> 01:12:28,692
Well, according to
a recent study

1498
01:12:28,822 --> 01:12:29,997
out of Columbia law school,

1499
01:12:30,128 --> 01:12:33,958
68% of convictions
in capital crimes

1500
01:12:34,088 --> 01:12:35,089
are overturned.

1501
01:12:35,220 --> 01:12:37,744
68%.

1502
01:12:37,875 --> 01:12:39,790
Often as a result
of flawed DNA evidence.

1503
01:12:39,920 --> 01:12:42,358
Now, isn't it
possible

1504
01:12:42,488 --> 01:12:44,534
that in this particular case,
the evidence is flawed?

1505
01:12:44,664 --> 01:12:46,449
In this particular case,

1506
01:12:46,579 --> 01:12:48,276
the defendant
confessed to the crime.

1507
01:12:48,407 --> 01:12:51,715
The evidence,
the DNA results,

1508
01:12:51,845 --> 01:12:54,370
are bearing
with that confession,

1509
01:12:54,500 --> 01:12:56,850
not at odds with it.

1510
01:12:56,981 --> 01:12:59,940
But of course, that presupposes
that the confession was obtained

1511
01:13:00,071 --> 01:13:01,855
under incontrovertible
conditions.

1512
01:13:01,986 --> 01:13:03,988
Now, would you like
to tell this court

1513
01:13:04,118 --> 01:13:07,383
how this particular confession
was obtained?

1514
01:13:09,385 --> 01:13:10,386
Kelly, Kelly...

1515
01:13:16,870 --> 01:13:19,699
Ms. Mcdowell, are you able
to answer the question?

1516
01:13:21,440 --> 01:13:22,833
Ms. Mcdowell...

1517
01:13:22,963 --> 01:13:24,356
Are you telling US

1518
01:13:24,487 --> 01:13:26,053
that Peter couldn't have
committed the crimes

1519
01:13:26,184 --> 01:13:27,838
of which he's accused?

1520
01:13:27,968 --> 01:13:28,316
No.

1521
01:13:31,885 --> 01:13:34,888
He did a terrible thing.

1522
01:13:38,109 --> 01:13:39,415
He made the worst choice
I could think of...

1523
01:13:42,287 --> 01:13:43,854
But there have been
19 years

1524
01:13:43,984 --> 01:13:46,422
of good choices.

1525
01:13:46,552 --> 01:13:49,512
19 years of no mistakes,

1526
01:13:49,642 --> 01:13:51,818
no wrong choices--

1527
01:13:51,949 --> 01:13:52,993
objection.

1528
01:13:53,124 --> 01:13:55,126
Your honor,

1529
01:13:55,256 --> 01:13:56,562
she's making
a speech.

1530
01:13:56,693 --> 01:14:00,174
Ms. Mcdowell,
just try to answer the question.

1531
01:14:00,305 --> 01:14:04,875
He's a good son...

1532
01:14:05,005 --> 01:14:06,267
And he's always been
a good son.

1533
01:14:06,398 --> 01:14:09,009
It's just that
something...

1534
01:14:09,140 --> 01:14:10,620
Something just went
horribly wrong.

1535
01:14:13,318 --> 01:14:14,362
For one moment,
one moment, something--

1536
01:14:14,493 --> 01:14:15,755
your honor...

1537
01:14:15,886 --> 01:14:16,843
Please.

1538
01:14:16,974 --> 01:14:19,193
All right, Mr. Callaghan,

1539
01:14:19,324 --> 01:14:20,630
let's have another question,
please.

1540
01:14:20,760 --> 01:14:21,631
Final question,
your honor.

1541
01:14:21,761 --> 01:14:23,415
Final question.

1542
01:14:23,546 --> 01:14:25,373
Is Peter remorseful?

1543
01:14:25,504 --> 01:14:27,027
Yes.

1544
01:14:27,158 --> 01:14:27,811
He knows what he did...

1545
01:14:31,162 --> 01:14:34,295
And he expects
to be punished for it.

1546
01:14:38,474 --> 01:14:40,432
He expects to be punished...

1547
01:14:40,563 --> 01:14:42,826
Because he loved her.

1548
01:14:45,785 --> 01:14:47,439
It's because
he loved her.

1549
01:14:47,570 --> 01:14:50,486
Susan, I hope that somewhere
you still understand that.

1550
01:14:54,011 --> 01:14:56,448
He knows what he did
was wrong.

1551
01:14:56,579 --> 01:14:58,842
He knows it.

1552
01:14:58,972 --> 01:15:00,670
He expects to be punished.

1553
01:15:00,800 --> 01:15:01,584
You can punish him.

1554
01:15:06,458 --> 01:15:08,286
Please don't kill him.

1555
01:15:27,653 --> 01:15:28,698
How much longer?

1556
01:15:28,828 --> 01:15:30,830
There's no way
to know.

1557
01:15:30,961 --> 01:15:34,442
Two hours,
two days.

1558
01:15:34,573 --> 01:15:35,661
His guilt isn't in
question, of course,

1559
01:15:35,792 --> 01:15:37,271
just his punishment.

1560
01:15:37,402 --> 01:15:39,839
You have to be prepared
for the worst result.

1561
01:15:39,970 --> 01:15:41,362
Is that what you think
is going to happen?

1562
01:15:41,493 --> 01:15:44,322
I never know
what's going to happen.

1563
01:15:44,452 --> 01:15:45,845
Juries are
unpredictable.

1564
01:15:45,976 --> 01:15:47,586
Sometimes they just
can't look past the facts

1565
01:15:47,717 --> 01:15:49,414
under any
circumstances,

1566
01:15:49,545 --> 01:15:51,895
completely devoid
of emotion.

1567
01:15:52,025 --> 01:15:53,505
But your feeling is
it doesn't look too good.

1568
01:15:55,246 --> 01:15:58,728
My feelings are immaterial,
detective, but...

1569
01:15:58,858 --> 01:16:00,381
No, they're not good.

1570
01:16:00,512 --> 01:16:03,776
Fit to stand trial,
fit for execution, right?

1571
01:16:03,907 --> 01:16:06,083
We can appeal, of course.

1572
01:16:12,655 --> 01:16:14,004
For how long?

1573
01:16:14,134 --> 01:16:16,397
Years.

1574
01:16:16,528 --> 01:16:18,182
Is that going to
save his life?

1575
01:16:18,312 --> 01:16:19,879
Well, I can't
guarantee that it will.

1576
01:16:20,010 --> 01:16:22,142
Sometimes
the appeal process runs out

1577
01:16:22,273 --> 01:16:23,535
and execution occurs,

1578
01:16:23,666 --> 01:16:24,884
sometimes it doesn't.

1579
01:16:25,015 --> 01:16:27,191
But either way,
you stand to make a fortune,

1580
01:16:27,321 --> 01:16:28,409
and my kid still lives his life

1581
01:16:28,540 --> 01:16:29,454
out on death row.

1582
01:16:30,760 --> 01:16:33,153
Not exactly the way I'd put it,

1583
01:16:33,284 --> 01:16:35,721
but, yes,
I am paid well for my services,

1584
01:16:35,852 --> 01:16:37,549
and your son lives his life
on death row.

1585
01:16:40,030 --> 01:16:41,771
And is that
an acceptable outcome for you?

1586
01:16:41,901 --> 01:16:43,729
It's an outcome
I've learned to live with.

1587
01:16:45,862 --> 01:16:47,820
Are you
married?

1588
01:16:47,951 --> 01:16:48,908
Never.

1589
01:16:49,039 --> 01:16:50,388
Got kids?

1590
01:16:50,518 --> 01:16:52,042
None that I know of.

1591
01:16:52,172 --> 01:16:54,000
Well, that's why
you can live with it.

1592
01:16:54,131 --> 01:16:55,959
Jamie...

1593
01:16:56,089 --> 01:16:57,003
The jury sent word.

1594
01:16:57,134 --> 01:16:58,091
Five minutes.

1595
01:17:02,400 --> 01:17:03,357
See you inside.

1596
01:17:14,281 --> 01:17:15,543
I suppose Callaghan told you.

1597
01:17:15,674 --> 01:17:17,110
What, to expect the worst?

1598
01:17:17,241 --> 01:17:18,242
To expect the death penalty?

1599
01:17:18,372 --> 01:17:19,896
Yeah, he told me.

1600
01:17:25,553 --> 01:17:27,599
It's...
It's not a given.

1601
01:17:27,730 --> 01:17:31,037
It doesn't
look good.

1602
01:17:34,127 --> 01:17:36,564
No, not too good.

1603
01:17:48,533 --> 01:17:51,014
I don't even know
if I still have my job...

1604
01:17:53,581 --> 01:17:54,844
And I just realized

1605
01:17:54,974 --> 01:17:56,497
I'm probably
going to have to sell my house

1606
01:17:56,628 --> 01:17:57,934
in order to pay
for Peter's appeals.

1607
01:18:00,980 --> 01:18:02,503
How is this happening?

1608
01:18:02,808 --> 01:18:04,375
How is this happening?

1609
01:18:09,641 --> 01:18:11,382
I'm here for you.

1610
01:18:14,559 --> 01:18:15,516
Thank you, Dan.

1611
01:18:17,693 --> 01:18:20,434
You're such a good guy.

1612
01:18:20,565 --> 01:18:22,262
We should go.

1613
01:18:24,787 --> 01:18:25,962
I don't want to go in.

1614
01:18:31,924 --> 01:18:32,751
Okay, okay...

1615
01:18:39,932 --> 01:18:42,543
Okay...

1616
01:18:42,674 --> 01:18:42,805
Okay.

1617
01:18:47,244 --> 01:18:49,899
All rise.

1618
01:18:50,813 --> 01:18:52,684
Please be seated.

1619
01:18:57,733 --> 01:18:58,646
All right, madam foreman,

1620
01:18:58,777 --> 01:19:00,823
in the matter

1621
01:19:00,953 --> 01:19:02,389
of the state
of Washington

1622
01:19:02,520 --> 01:19:04,043
vs. Peter mcdowell,

1623
01:19:04,174 --> 01:19:06,132
has the jury reached
a unanimous verdict?

1624
01:19:06,263 --> 01:19:07,699
We have, your honor.

1625
01:19:07,830 --> 01:19:10,093
Will the defendant
please stand?

1626
01:19:12,791 --> 01:19:15,489
Bailiff...

1627
01:19:21,539 --> 01:19:23,497
Thank you.

1628
01:19:30,243 --> 01:19:31,723
And how do you find
the defendant?

1629
01:19:31,854 --> 01:19:32,768
Guilty on all charges.

1630
01:19:35,161 --> 01:19:36,815
And has the
jury decided

1631
01:19:36,946 --> 01:19:38,643
upon a unanimous
sentence?

1632
01:19:38,774 --> 01:19:40,036
We have,
your honor.

1633
01:19:40,166 --> 01:19:41,733
And what is the sentence,
madam foreman?

1634
01:19:41,864 --> 01:19:43,474
Life without parole.

1635
01:19:49,741 --> 01:19:50,960
It's what
we wanted.

1636
01:19:51,090 --> 01:19:52,526
Order...

1637
01:19:54,006 --> 01:19:54,920
We must have order
in the courtroom.

1638
01:20:27,431 --> 01:20:29,346
What?

1639
01:20:29,476 --> 01:20:30,086
Hey, you got
a minute?

1640
01:20:30,216 --> 01:20:30,913
No.

1641
01:20:36,788 --> 01:20:37,833
You know, it's funny.

1642
01:20:37,963 --> 01:20:39,356
I thought I heard myself
say, "no."

1643
01:20:40,574 --> 01:20:43,490
How you doing,
Jamie?

1644
01:20:43,621 --> 01:20:44,578
I'm all right.

1645
01:20:44,709 --> 01:20:46,667
That's good...

1646
01:20:46,798 --> 01:20:47,843
And how's Peter?

1647
01:20:50,541 --> 01:20:52,935
He's hanging in there.

1648
01:20:53,065 --> 01:20:53,936
I'm proud of him.

1649
01:20:54,066 --> 01:20:55,198
You know...

1650
01:20:55,328 --> 01:20:57,330
It's hard adjusting,

1651
01:20:57,461 --> 01:20:58,941
but he's in therapy,

1652
01:20:59,071 --> 01:21:03,032
and, uh...

1653
01:21:03,162 --> 01:21:03,902
And so the world moves forward.

1654
01:21:04,033 --> 01:21:06,992
Well, what can I say?

1655
01:21:10,996 --> 01:21:12,215
Ray rankin dropped the lawsuit.

1656
01:21:12,345 --> 01:21:14,173
Is that right?

1657
01:21:14,304 --> 01:21:15,958
Yeah, Glenn arrested him
on drug charges.

1658
01:21:16,088 --> 01:21:20,353
Possession with intent to sell.

1659
01:21:20,484 --> 01:21:22,225
Selling drugs right out of
his old man's house.

1660
01:21:22,355 --> 01:21:24,749
Hmm...

1661
01:21:24,880 --> 01:21:27,360
Anyway, we made a deal,

1662
01:21:27,491 --> 01:21:28,796
less jail time
if he drops the suit.

1663
01:21:28,927 --> 01:21:31,103
Glenn's case
from start to finish.

1664
01:21:31,234 --> 01:21:32,452
Well, good for Glenn.

1665
01:21:33,149 --> 01:21:34,933
You ready to come back to work?

1666
01:21:37,283 --> 01:21:38,197
No...

1667
01:21:38,328 --> 01:21:40,504
No, I'm definitely
not ready yet.

1668
01:21:42,288 --> 01:21:43,594
I really just
wanted to come by

1669
01:21:43,724 --> 01:21:44,900
and just thank you
for everything that you've done.

1670
01:21:47,990 --> 01:21:50,383
Door's always open.

1671
01:21:52,081 --> 01:21:53,082
That's really good to know.

1672
01:21:54,910 --> 01:21:56,215
Anyway, I got to scoot.

1673
01:21:56,346 --> 01:21:58,914
I just wanted to...

1674
01:21:59,044 --> 01:22:01,655
Yeah, I, uh...

1675
01:22:01,786 --> 01:22:02,700
Well, you know.

1676
01:22:04,702 --> 01:22:06,008
I'll see you.

1677
01:22:55,709 --> 01:22:56,884
How are you?

1678
01:22:58,886 --> 01:23:01,019
Up and down.

1679
01:23:02,499 --> 01:23:03,543
It's not easy
to find your footing

1680
01:23:03,674 --> 01:23:04,980
when your whole world changes.

1681
01:23:07,243 --> 01:23:09,810
No.

1682
01:23:09,941 --> 01:23:10,898
I'm trained to help people

1683
01:23:11,029 --> 01:23:15,686
through hard
emotional transitions.

1684
01:23:15,816 --> 01:23:17,949
Now I need someone to help me.

1685
01:23:19,255 --> 01:23:24,216
That used to be me.

1686
01:23:24,347 --> 01:23:26,914
It can't be me anymore,
can it?

1687
01:23:31,136 --> 01:23:34,400
No, Jamie.

1688
01:23:34,531 --> 01:23:36,315
It can't.

1689
01:23:55,421 --> 01:23:56,857
I see...

1690
01:23:56,988 --> 01:23:57,989
I see you got a new cat.

1691
01:24:02,080 --> 01:24:03,168
Named her Abby.

1692
01:24:03,299 --> 01:24:04,604
That's nice.

1693
01:24:04,735 --> 01:24:05,649
I know you like cats.

1694
01:24:07,346 --> 01:24:08,521
And I know you don't.

1695
01:24:12,438 --> 01:24:13,526
I'm allergic.

1696
01:24:13,657 --> 01:24:15,833
I know.

1697
01:24:15,963 --> 01:24:18,401
I remember.

1698
01:24:22,187 --> 01:24:24,407
You're moving.

1699
01:24:28,976 --> 01:24:31,457
Yeah, I can't stay here.

1700
01:24:38,377 --> 01:24:44,079
Well, maybe when you get
where you're going...

1701
01:24:46,907 --> 01:24:47,647
You'll call me.

1702
01:24:52,304 --> 01:24:56,178
When I get where I'm going,

1703
01:24:56,308 --> 01:24:57,048
I'll call.
