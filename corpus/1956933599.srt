Okay, let me see it again.

Hey!

00:01:58,919 --> 00:01:59,820
Forgive me.

00:01:59,853 --> 00:02:05,693
I'm jealous. 
Kristine, it is so beautiful.

You must feel like
the luckiest woman

22
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:12,900
You know, when I first met
Nick Taylor, I thought,

23
00:02:12,933 --> 00:02:15,836
now there's a man
who is going to make some woman

24
00:02:15,869 --> 00:02:17,605
very, very happy.

00:02:17,638 --> 00:02:19,873
Well, you're right 
on that one.

00:02:19,907 --> 00:02:21,175
So, when is the wedding?

00:02:21,209 --> 00:02:22,576
December 19th.

28
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:27,815

I'd marry a cop.

Come on, you know
it's good paper.

43

It's the best damn paper
in the West Coast.

I wanted to talk to Jake about.

There's nothing to talk about.

take it or leave it.

What the hell do you care?

51

Have Jake run the printer
an extra five minutes

52
00:03:48,429 --> 00:03:50,631
and we're all happy.

One, we ain't friends,
and two, you want a discount?

It's quite a party you have
going on here.

they make my customers,

00:12:04,324 --> 00:12:06,259
Who invited you anyway?

184
00:12:06,293 --> 00:12:09,429
A good friend of yours,
Lenny G.

185
00:12:09,462 --> 00:12:11,799
You're under arrest.

186
00:12:11,832 --> 00:12:13,133
Stupid!

187
00:12:13,166 --> 00:12:15,335
Stupid woman.

188
00:12:15,368 --> 00:12:16,103
Go ahead.

189
00:12:16,136 --> 00:12:17,437
Shoot.

190
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:24,544
The gun is empty.

191
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:26,346
Go on shoot!

192
00:12:27,014 --> 00:12:29,082
[guns clicking]
She is a cop!

193
00:12:29,116 --> 00:12:30,117
[fighting]
[groans]

194
00:12:45,198 --> 00:12:47,167
Has anybody seen Melinda?

195
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,969
Let's get out of here.

196
00:12:49,002 --> 00:12:50,904
[gun fire]
Stop them!

197
00:12:50,938 --> 00:12:52,205
They're cops!

198
00:12:53,373 --> 00:12:55,208

199
00:13:12,159 --> 00:13:14,061
[loud bang]
[gunshot]

200
00:13:21,468 --> 00:13:22,602
You're finished, 
you piece of shit!

201
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:24,104
You just killed a cop.

202
00:13:24,137 --> 00:13:26,339
I'm gonna smash that
counterfeiting ring of yours.

203
00:13:26,373 --> 00:13:27,074
It's not my ring.

204
00:13:27,107 --> 00:13:29,276
I don't deal it. 
I just buy it.

205
00:13:29,309 --> 00:13:31,078
Who deals it?

206
00:13:31,111 --> 00:13:33,480
Answer me before
I blow your fucking head off.

207
00:13:33,513 --> 00:13:35,182
His name is David.

208
00:13:35,215 --> 00:13:36,183
It's his operation.

209
00:13:36,216 --> 00:13:37,550
It's not my ring.

210
00:13:37,584 --> 00:13:39,186
Keep talking.

211
00:13:39,219 --> 00:13:42,322
It's 240 McCaan,
the old warehouse district.

212
00:13:42,355 --> 00:13:44,624
But I can't promise you
that anybody will still

213
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:47,060
be alive when you get there!

214
00:13:48,028 --> 00:13:50,130

Money, money, everywhere.

218
00:14:08,215 --> 00:14:10,417
Nina, what do say we
scrape off a few bills

219
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:14,021
off the top, catch us a flight
to Rosarita Beach.

220
00:14:14,054 --> 00:14:17,290
Lose ourselves in
a bottle of Cuervo Gold,

221
00:14:17,324 --> 00:14:22,595
and if you're good,
I'll let you swallow the worm.

222
00:14:22,629 --> 00:14:27,500
In France, we have a term
for men like you, Jack.

223
00:14:27,534 --> 00:14:29,937
Yeah, what do you call that?

224
00:14:29,970 --> 00:14:31,404
American.

225
00:14:32,339 --> 00:14:38,511
* music 
She is worse than my old lady.

226
00:14:38,545 --> 00:14:40,680
[laughter]
Yeah, but I bet

227
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:41,949
she's worth it.

228
00:14:41,982 --> 00:14:45,018
Right, Sims?

229
00:14:45,818 --> 00:14:56,063
* music 
David, your new plates

230
00:14:56,063 --> 00:15:06,073
* music 
David, your new plates

231
00:15:12,345 --> 00:15:14,514
have tripled our business
in the last month.

232
00:15:14,547 --> 00:15:17,250
That's because
they're perfect.

233
00:15:17,284 --> 00:15:22,055
They're art, purer. 
I expect a larger cut,

234
00:15:22,089 --> 00:15:23,456
much larger.

235
00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:25,425
Of course you do,
you're my right hand,

236
00:15:25,458 --> 00:15:26,659
you're my partner.

237
00:15:26,693 --> 00:15:27,961
I'll take care of you.

238
00:15:27,995 --> 00:15:30,998
I don't need any one to
take care of me.

239
00:15:31,031 --> 00:15:32,699
I want what's coming to me.

240
00:15:32,732 --> 00:15:35,235
Nina, without me you would
still be whoring for a living.

241
00:15:35,268 --> 00:15:38,071
I was doing fine
before I met you and

242
00:15:38,105 --> 00:15:40,107
I was never a whore.

243
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:41,741
You bounce
from millionaire to millionaire

244
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:44,244
like a ping pong ball.

245
00:15:44,277 --> 00:15:45,412
That's a whore in my book.

246
00:15:45,445 --> 00:15:47,047
But it doesn't matter.

247
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:49,549
That's the past and
I took you away from it.

248
00:15:49,582 --> 00:15:51,751
So, don't tell me
what I owe you!

249
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:53,486
Understand?

250
00:15:59,059 --> 00:16:00,093
[cart pushing]
Okay, let's get these out

251
00:16:01,528 --> 00:16:03,163

be advised,

265
00:17:22,975 --> 00:17:27,647
we have a stolen squad car
heading east on [indistinct]

266
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:30,683
Attention two [indistinct]
that's the two assholes

267
00:17:30,717 --> 00:17:33,853
up in front of us.

268
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:38,358
Oh, we're screwed man,
we're dead.

Thanks.

They took a right.

00:18:06,153 --> 00:18:08,255
I'm heading them off of
the path darling.

275
00:18:08,288 --> 00:18:10,157
[police siren]
We lost them man!

276
00:18:12,225 --> 00:18:14,694
We lost them!

277
00:18:14,727 --> 00:18:16,129
Told you.

278
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:23,803

00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:45,625
What the hell are we
going to do now?

282
00:18:45,658 --> 00:18:47,894
Half our cash
was left behind.

283
00:18:47,927 --> 00:18:49,696
Cops will trace the numbers
and then everything we have

284
00:18:49,729 --> 00:18:51,264
will be worth shit.

285
00:18:51,298 --> 00:18:53,866
We have to dump it all ASAP.

286
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:56,836
I sent Tommy to sell
as much as possible.

287
00:18:56,869 --> 00:18:59,406
Did you at least
save the plates?

288
00:18:59,439 --> 00:19:01,908
Yes, I have them.

289
00:19:01,941 --> 00:19:02,575
Where are they?

290
00:19:02,609 --> 00:19:03,543
They're safe.

291
00:19:03,576 --> 00:19:04,577
Where?

292
00:19:04,611 --> 00:19:07,814
I said, they're safe.

293
00:19:14,421 --> 00:19:15,822
You know what the penalty
for having this much

294
00:19:15,855 --> 00:19:16,689
counterfeit dough is?

295
00:19:16,723 --> 00:19:18,258
This much?

296
00:19:18,291 --> 00:19:19,091
Yeah.

297
00:19:19,125 --> 00:19:21,794
I was hitchhiking,
and he picked me up.

298
00:19:21,828 --> 00:19:25,465
In a stolen police car?

299
00:19:25,498 --> 00:19:28,535
20 years in the
state penitentiary asshole!

300
00:19:28,568 --> 00:19:30,570
Now, give me a name!

301
00:19:30,603 --> 00:19:31,404
The name is Tommy.

302
00:19:31,438 --> 00:19:32,739
Tommy who?

303
00:19:32,772 --> 00:19:34,507
Tommy Johnson.

304
00:19:36,976 --> 00:19:47,220

Hi, Wade.

00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:52,692

Hi, Wade.

306
00:19:52,725 --> 00:19:53,860
Oh shit!

307
00:19:53,893 --> 00:19:55,862
Long time no see.

308
00:19:55,895 --> 00:19:58,398
Look, I love to stay and chat
and everything, alright,

309
00:19:58,431 --> 00:19:59,832
but you know
I got to go.

310
00:19:59,866 --> 00:20:01,801
You look nervous Wade.

311
00:20:01,834 --> 00:20:03,936
Not back on crack again
are you?

312
00:20:03,970 --> 00:20:04,504
Shit!

313
00:20:04,537 --> 00:20:05,137
No man.

314
00:20:05,171 --> 00:20:05,605
I just say no to that shit.

315
00:20:05,638 --> 00:20:07,974
Crack kills right?

316
00:20:08,007 --> 00:20:09,542
Why are you hacking at me
like this, man?

317
00:20:09,576 --> 00:20:10,710
I'm not doing anything.

318
00:20:10,743 --> 00:20:11,744
I'm just standing here
being cool, man.

319
00:20:11,778 --> 00:20:12,345
I don't know anything.

320
00:20:12,379 --> 00:20:13,646
I don't know anybody man.

321
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:15,448
You seem a little paranoid,
Wade.

322
00:20:15,482 --> 00:20:15,915
Paranoid?

323
00:20:15,948 --> 00:20:16,749
I'm not paranoid.

324
00:20:16,783 --> 00:20:17,517
Are you paranoid?

325
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:18,551
Relax Wade.

326
00:20:18,585 --> 00:20:21,454
We're looking for your old
partner, Tommy Johnson.

327
00:20:21,488 --> 00:20:23,556
He wasn't at home. 
We thought you might

328
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:24,391
know where he is.

329
00:20:24,424 --> 00:20:26,793
It seems he's
passing some fake bills.

330
00:20:26,826 --> 00:20:27,894
No man.

331
00:20:27,927 --> 00:20:29,396
I don't know where he is man!

332
00:20:29,429 --> 00:20:31,698
I don't get any counterfeit 20s
or anything.

333
00:20:31,731 --> 00:20:32,932
Didn't say you did.

334
00:20:32,965 --> 00:20:33,866
Did I say that, McKay?

335
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:34,434
No!

336
00:20:34,467 --> 00:20:35,835
He mentioned it himself!

337
00:20:35,868 --> 00:20:40,840
Sounds like probable cause
to me.

338
00:20:40,873 --> 00:20:42,275
What do we have here Wade?

339
00:20:42,309 --> 00:20:44,277
They're cops!

340
00:20:44,311 --> 00:20:45,378
[surprised]
They're cops!

341
00:20:46,679 --> 00:20:50,283
[groans]
Is that money real, Wade?

342
00:20:50,317 --> 00:20:51,418
Get off of me man.

343
00:20:51,451 --> 00:20:53,019
[indistinct]
I'm not the only one

344
00:20:53,052 --> 00:20:53,886
who has it, man.

345
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,655
Tommy came in here,
passed the shit up.

346
00:20:55,688 --> 00:20:56,656
Everybody in the bar
has that stuff.

347
00:20:56,689 --> 00:20:57,490
Not just me man.

348
00:20:57,524 --> 00:20:59,492
That guy has some,
that guy has some...

349
00:20:59,526 --> 00:21:00,727
Everybody man!

350
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:02,429
[gun firing]
[groans]

351
00:21:02,462 --> 00:21:03,496
[screams]
Get out of the way!

352
00:21:03,530 --> 00:21:04,697
[gun firing]

00:21:04,731 --> 00:21:12,805

355
00:21:17,076 --> 00:21:18,811
[groans]
I'm out of here.

356
00:21:21,481 --> 00:21:22,649
[groans]
Wade, you don't look too good.

357
00:21:28,855 --> 00:21:31,791
Oh, I bet that's gonna hurt.

358
00:21:31,824 --> 00:21:33,660
You shot me man!

359
00:21:33,693 --> 00:21:37,764
[groans]
This sucks!

360
00:21:37,797 --> 00:21:39,466
I think you'll live.

361
00:21:39,499 --> 00:21:41,334
[heavy breathing]
So, where's Tommy?

362
00:21:41,368 --> 00:21:44,103
He's staying at
his girlfriend's over in

363
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:46,639
Orange in Wilshire.

364
00:21:46,673 --> 00:21:47,907
[groans]
Thanks!

365
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:49,909
Hey Wade!

366
00:21:49,942 --> 00:21:59,552
Congratulate me,
I'm getting married.

367
00:21:59,586 --> 00:22:00,687
Freeze!

368
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,855
Hands on your head!

369
00:22:02,889 --> 00:22:04,724
Oh man, what are you doing?

370
00:22:04,757 --> 00:22:06,759
We're doing nothing wrong.

371
00:22:06,793 --> 00:22:09,729
Oh yeah?

372
00:22:09,762 --> 00:22:11,364
What's that?

373
00:22:11,398 --> 00:22:12,999
It's a little cocaine.

374
00:22:13,032 --> 00:22:15,702
But other than that,
we ain't doing nothing.

375
00:22:15,735 --> 00:22:16,936
Hey Nick.

376
00:22:16,969 --> 00:22:19,806
You keep forgetting,
are these things legal?

377
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:23,910
Oh, probably not
anymore legal than this.

378
00:22:23,943 --> 00:22:26,746
Hey man, the money
ain't even real.

379
00:22:26,779 --> 00:22:28,681
Oh shit!

380
00:22:28,715 --> 00:22:33,119
I didn't mean that..

381
00:22:33,152 --> 00:22:38,491
Tommy, I think
we need to talk.

382
00:22:38,525 --> 00:22:44,631
[phone rings]
Hello.

383
00:22:44,664 --> 00:22:48,501
Hi Tommy.

384
00:22:48,535 --> 00:22:49,736
Who are these people?

385
00:22:49,769 --> 00:22:51,604
What do I look like, a rat?

386
00:22:51,638 --> 00:22:53,573
You're my very good friend.

387
00:22:53,606 --> 00:22:56,509
I'm telling you they're cool.

388
00:22:56,543 --> 00:23:00,947
They'd better be,
I'm trusting you.

389
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:02,615
I'll send Nina.

390
00:23:02,649 --> 00:23:04,083
Alright
[phone hang up]

391
00:23:05,518 --> 00:23:06,819
That's it.

392
00:23:06,853 --> 00:23:09,188
Tommy, you're beautiful.

393
00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:10,457
Isn't he great?

394
00:23:10,490 --> 00:23:11,524
A model citizen.

395
00:23:11,558 --> 00:23:15,695
[slapping]
You need to make a delivery.

396
00:23:15,728 --> 00:23:17,630
To who?

397
00:23:17,664 --> 00:23:18,665
Tommy.

398
00:23:18,698 --> 00:23:20,667
I don't trust
that fat bastard.

399
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:22,769
I told you, we got to
get rid of this shit.

400
00:23:22,802 --> 00:23:24,471
Tommy has already sold
what he has and now,

401
00:23:24,504 --> 00:23:26,005
he has got another buyer.

402
00:23:26,038 --> 00:23:26,906
But he needs the paper.

403
00:23:26,939 --> 00:23:28,841
Besides, you're not supposed to
trust him.

404
00:23:28,875 --> 00:23:31,811
You're supposed to trust me.

405
00:23:31,844 --> 00:23:34,981
[sigh]
I'll pick up the guys

406
00:23:35,014 --> 00:23:36,983

Now, I'm ready.

411
00:24:06,879 --> 00:24:07,914

She's gone.

00:26:25,251 --> 00:26:27,386
Not quite.

433
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:29,789
Drop your gun
or I'd kill him.

434
00:26:29,822 --> 00:26:30,690
Don't do it, Kris.

435
00:26:30,723 --> 00:26:32,124
Let him go.

436
00:26:32,158 --> 00:26:36,195
I swear to God I'll kill him.

437
00:26:36,228 --> 00:26:37,096
Drop it!

438
00:26:37,129 --> 00:26:39,699

You set me up.

448
00:27:38,024 --> 00:27:39,258
What?

449
00:27:39,291 --> 00:27:45,331
We had a partnership
and you sold me out.

Ms. McKay,

457
00:28:29,341 --> 00:28:32,111
what a pleasant surprise.

458
00:28:32,144 --> 00:28:33,946
You look tired.

459
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:37,316
I guess you'll be hitting
the singles bars again, huh?

460
00:28:37,349 --> 00:28:40,252
I'm sorry I spoiled
your wedding plans.

461
00:28:40,286 --> 00:28:42,254
Don't take it personally.

462
00:28:42,288 --> 00:28:43,756
I don't even know you.

463
00:28:43,790 --> 00:28:47,526
You were just in the
wrong place at the wrong time.

464
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:51,363
Well, actually, he was.

465
00:28:51,397 --> 00:28:55,902
Why did you come here?

466
00:28:55,935 --> 00:28:59,438
Well, I guess, you're not
much of a talker today.

467
00:28:59,471 --> 00:29:01,440
So, I will excuse myself.

468
00:29:01,473 --> 00:29:03,375
Good day.

469
00:29:05,845 --> 00:29:07,279
Why?

470
00:29:07,313 --> 00:29:08,180
I beg your pardon?

471
00:29:08,214 --> 00:29:09,849
Did you say something?

472
00:29:09,882 --> 00:29:11,417
Why did you do it?

473
00:29:11,450 --> 00:29:14,787
Why did you kill him?

474
00:29:14,821 --> 00:29:16,789
That is a fair question.

475
00:29:16,823 --> 00:29:19,158
[sigh]
I did it because I wanted to.

476
00:29:35,307 --> 00:29:38,310
Any more questions?

477
00:29:38,344 --> 00:29:39,378
I think you killed him
for the same reason

478
00:29:39,411 --> 00:29:42,514
you killed everybody else,
because you couldn't kill

479
00:29:42,548 --> 00:29:45,885
that one man
you really wanted to.

480
00:29:45,918 --> 00:29:48,054
Your father is already dead.

481
00:29:48,087 --> 00:29:51,190
I see you've done a little
research on me Ms. McKay.

482
00:29:51,223 --> 00:29:51,623
God!

483
00:29:51,657 --> 00:29:53,325
You're so smart.

484
00:29:53,359 --> 00:29:55,828
Yes, my father beat me,
he abused me,

485
00:29:55,862 --> 00:30:01,000
and I'm just basing my rage
on every man that crosses me.

486
00:30:01,033 --> 00:30:03,936
You're father beat you
because you killed your mother.

487
00:30:03,970 --> 00:30:05,504
It's a lie and you know it.

488
00:30:05,537 --> 00:30:07,406
She died giving birth to me.

489
00:30:07,439 --> 00:30:09,108
I did not kill my mother.

490
00:30:09,141 --> 00:30:11,243
Well, your father
seemed to think so.

491
00:30:11,277 --> 00:30:14,546
Yes he did, and he died
before I was old enough

492
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:17,083
to realize he was wrong.

493
00:30:17,116 --> 00:30:19,385
You're a pathetic
little woman, Nina.

494
00:30:19,418 --> 00:30:23,289
So, you came here to tell me
I'm pathetic?

495
00:30:23,322 --> 00:30:24,323
No.

496
00:30:24,356 --> 00:30:25,291
I came here to tell you that
you're damn lucky that

497
00:30:25,324 --> 00:30:28,961
these bars are between us,
and you better pray

498
00:30:28,995 --> 00:30:30,396
it stays that way.

499
00:30:30,429 --> 00:30:35,968
Well, it might not
stay that way.

500
00:30:36,002 --> 00:30:41,307
Have you ever been imprisoned
Ms. McKay?

501
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:44,010
I suppose not.

502
00:30:44,043 --> 00:30:49,481
It's very cold, very lonely,
very dismal.

503
00:30:49,515 --> 00:30:51,217
An empty cell.

504
00:30:51,250 --> 00:30:54,153
A chair with no one
to sit in it.

505
00:30:54,186 --> 00:30:58,590
Out of sheer desperation,
you end up talking to yourself,

506
00:30:58,624 --> 00:31:04,363
holding entire conversation
with no one.

507
00:31:04,396 --> 00:31:07,466
That's what it's like to be
alone, Ms. McKay.

508
00:31:07,499 --> 00:31:09,568
Get used to it.

courthouse tonight where

she was convicted for
the murder of police sergeant,

Nicolas Taylor,
Nina Lindell was literally

520
00:31:56,615 --> 00:31:59,485
attacked right on
the courthouse steps.

521
00:31:59,518 --> 00:32:03,122
Her attacker was none other
than detective Kristine McKay,

522

the fiancée of
the murdered officer.

523
00:32:07,459 --> 00:32:09,996
McKay, I know what
you're going through.

524
00:32:10,029 --> 00:32:12,664
But there is no
goddamn excuse.

525
00:32:12,698 --> 00:32:14,333
I'm gonna do
what I can to prevent

526
00:32:14,366 --> 00:32:16,035

Yeah, just what we need.

McKay, you may have to
take a vacation

McKay, come on.

It doesn't have to
come to this.

534
00:32:34,653 --> 00:32:36,222
Probably better this way,
McKay.

535
00:32:36,255 --> 00:32:40,492

any more cops.

00:33:14,493 --> 00:33:16,162
Hand me my paper.

543
00:33:16,195 --> 00:33:17,329
Pardon?

544
00:33:17,363 --> 00:33:18,264
My paper.

545
00:33:18,297 --> 00:33:21,133
You're stepping on it.

546
00:33:28,274 --> 00:33:31,243
I didn't think
I was gonna make it.

547
00:33:31,277 --> 00:33:37,483
The police were arresting
some gang kids up the street.

548
00:33:37,516 --> 00:33:38,750
You hear about
drive-by shootings

549
00:33:38,784 --> 00:33:41,420
in neighborhoods like this.

550
00:33:41,453 --> 00:33:43,755
So, is Mr. McKay here?

551
00:33:43,789 --> 00:33:44,756
No.

552
00:33:44,790 --> 00:33:45,291
No?

553
00:33:45,324 --> 00:33:46,024
We had an appointment.

554
00:33:46,058 --> 00:33:50,229
My secretary set it--
I'm McKay.

555
00:33:50,262 --> 00:33:56,268
You're this McKay?

556
00:33:56,302 --> 00:34:00,739
You have a partner?

557
00:34:00,772 --> 00:34:02,608
Do you want protection or not?

558
00:34:02,641 --> 00:34:03,709
Well, yeah.

559
00:34:03,742 --> 00:34:05,077
I need a bodyguard.

560
00:34:05,111 --> 00:34:08,214
But to be frank,
you don't think anybody

561
00:34:08,247 --> 00:34:10,749
would want a bodyguard
who is a girl.

562
00:34:10,782 --> 00:34:14,686
I mean, do you think you can
handle it?

564
00:34:17,356 --> 00:34:18,424

My lawyer is gonna

566
00:34:24,330 --> 00:34:25,531

00:36:49,941 --> 00:36:51,410
relax!

580
00:36:58,417 --> 00:36:59,618
[door closes]
I thought you're in the slam.

581
00:36:59,651 --> 00:37:00,986
What are you doing here?

582
00:37:01,019 --> 00:37:01,887
What do you think?

583
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:03,489
I want my money.

584
00:37:03,522 --> 00:37:04,556
Well, right, your money.

585
00:37:04,590 --> 00:37:05,757
I'll get it.

586
00:37:05,791 --> 00:37:06,825
Have you seen Jake?

587
00:37:06,858 --> 00:37:07,993
I'm looking for him.

588
00:37:08,026 --> 00:37:09,127
No, I haven't seen Jake.

589
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:11,697
You know things are a little
hairy after you got busted.

590
00:37:11,730 --> 00:37:12,864
Clients got real paranoid.

591
00:37:12,898 --> 00:37:17,436
What is this?

592
00:37:17,469 --> 00:37:18,937
It's your money.

593
00:37:18,970 --> 00:37:21,873
I had 17,000 dollars.

594
00:37:21,907 --> 00:37:25,777
I told you,
the clients got paranoid.

595
00:37:25,811 --> 00:37:28,013
No one was taking
the play dough.

596
00:37:28,046 --> 00:37:30,048
The shit was useless alright?

597
00:37:30,081 --> 00:37:33,319
This guy offered me 200 bucks
for the whole lot.

598
00:37:33,352 --> 00:37:36,722
200 dollars for 17,000?

599
00:37:36,755 --> 00:37:39,358
For 17,000 shit dollars.

600
00:37:39,391 --> 00:37:41,860
Hey, I did you a favor.

601
00:37:41,893 --> 00:37:46,432
And now, I'm going to
do you a favor.

602
00:37:46,465 --> 00:37:47,733
[gun fires]
Adieu.

603
00:37:57,776 --> 00:37:59,745
So you're gonna
get off your ass

604
00:37:59,778 --> 00:38:00,979
and do something today?

605
00:38:01,012 --> 00:38:03,415
I mean, look at this place,
it's a dump.

606
00:38:03,449 --> 00:38:06,485
Why don't you, like, take out
the trash or sweep the floor.

607
00:38:06,518 --> 00:38:09,655
Get some order in this place.

608
00:38:09,688 --> 00:38:11,990
The place stinks Flash.

609
00:38:12,023 --> 00:38:15,093
You just sit there
day after day after day.

Don't you miss life?

611

[dog whimpering]
Oh, neither do I.

612
00:38:25,637 --> 00:38:27,739
Do you think people
get second chances?

613
00:38:27,773 --> 00:38:30,876
[dog whimpering]
Well, it doesn't matter anyway.

614
00:38:30,909 --> 00:38:32,711
'Cause if you screw it up once,
you're just gonna

615
00:38:32,744 --> 00:38:34,045
screw it up again.

616
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:37,315
[phone rings]
Yeah?

617
00:38:39,851 --> 00:38:42,354
Is this Kristine McKay
of McKay's Protection Services?

It's Kristine McKay
to see Lawton Hobbs.

Excuse me, can you tell me
where Lawton Hobbs is?

627
00:40:17,783 --> 00:40:19,084
Oh, you must be the plumber.

628
00:40:19,117 --> 00:40:26,492
Yeah, he is around in the back,
you can just go on in.

Where is Lawton Hobbs?

631
00:41:05,731 --> 00:41:06,632
He is right over there.

632
00:41:06,665 --> 00:41:07,966
Are you the plumber?

633
00:41:07,999 --> 00:41:09,968
The cabana toilet
is totally clogged.

634
00:41:10,001 --> 00:41:10,468
No.

635
00:41:10,502 --> 00:41:11,603
I'm not the plumber.

I need a partner.

640
00:41:42,601 --> 00:41:44,970
Hey who wants to play with me?

641
00:41:45,003 --> 00:41:45,737
Excuse me.

642
00:41:45,771 --> 00:41:46,605
Are you the plumber?

643
00:41:46,638 --> 00:41:48,006
No, I'm not the plumber.

644
00:41:48,039 --> 00:41:48,740
What?

645
00:41:48,774 --> 00:41:49,875
Some sort of a
singing telegram?

646
00:41:49,908 --> 00:41:50,942
You wish.

647
00:41:50,976 --> 00:41:52,210
Kristine McKay.

648
00:41:52,243 --> 00:41:53,144
Oh!

649
00:41:53,178 --> 00:41:54,179
Excuse me.

650
00:41:54,212 --> 00:41:55,046
I'm sorry.

651
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:56,147
Forgive me.

652
00:41:56,181 --> 00:41:58,283
I'm Lawton Hobbs and and I wanna
thank you for coming.

653
00:41:58,316 --> 00:41:59,718
Do you play ping pong?

654
00:41:59,751 --> 00:42:00,686
'Cause I need a partner.

655
00:42:00,719 --> 00:42:01,887
I don't play ping pong.

656
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:02,487
Oh, nonsense.

657
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:04,022
Everybody plays ping pong.

658
00:42:04,055 --> 00:42:06,157
Come on.

659
00:42:06,858 --> 00:42:07,593
Alright.

660
00:42:07,626 --> 00:42:08,226
Zero.

661
00:42:08,259 --> 00:42:10,762
Zero.

662
00:42:10,796 --> 00:42:11,830
[ping pong ball bouncing]
So here's the deal.

663
00:42:11,863 --> 00:42:15,233
I'm an entrepreneur,
an investor, and a connoisseur.

664
00:42:15,266 --> 00:42:18,837
[chuckles]
Come on McKay.

665
00:42:18,870 --> 00:42:20,639
Help me out here.

666
00:42:20,672 --> 00:42:22,641
Zero, one.

667
00:42:22,674 --> 00:42:24,710
As I said, I'm a connoisseur,
connoisseur of

668
00:42:24,743 --> 00:42:25,877
the opposite sex.

669
00:42:25,911 --> 00:42:27,746
[ping pong ball bouncing]
I love women.

670
00:42:27,779 --> 00:42:29,715
Women of all kinds.

671
00:42:29,748 --> 00:42:32,651
I love the beautiful,
plain, sweet--

672
00:42:32,684 --> 00:42:33,284
Come on.

673
00:42:33,318 --> 00:42:36,287
Sexy, sleazy, sophisticated.

674
00:42:36,321 --> 00:42:37,889
I like women in leather.

675
00:42:37,923 --> 00:42:39,157
Is there a point
to any of these?

676
00:42:39,190 --> 00:42:40,091
I'm sorry.

677
00:42:40,125 --> 00:42:41,226
I got carried away.

678
00:42:41,259 --> 00:42:43,862
Yes.

679
00:42:43,895 --> 00:42:45,897
Last year,
I was dating this woman.

680
00:42:45,931 --> 00:42:48,867
We got very serious,
and I almost married her.

681
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:50,636
After series of events,
I found out that she was

682
00:42:50,669 --> 00:42:53,905
certifiably insane,
so naturally I broke it off.

683
00:42:53,939 --> 00:42:57,042
So, you want protection
from a psycho ex-girlfriend?

684
00:42:57,075 --> 00:42:58,744
She murdered a man.

685
00:42:58,777 --> 00:43:02,914
I refused to pay
for her lawyer.

686
00:43:02,948 --> 00:43:04,983
She got life.

687
00:43:05,016 --> 00:43:06,785
She swore revenge,
which I did not worry about

688
00:43:06,818 --> 00:43:08,053
until last night.

689
00:43:08,086 --> 00:43:09,655
She broke out of prison.

690
00:43:09,688 --> 00:43:11,122
What's the name of
this woman?

691
00:43:11,156 --> 00:43:13,825
That's why I want you.

692
00:43:13,859 --> 00:43:15,360
It's Nina Lindell.

693
00:43:16,094 --> 00:43:20,632
* music 
I didn't come here

694
00:43:20,666 --> 00:43:22,167
to play games.

[racket clanking]
Hey!

696
00:43:27,138 --> 00:43:28,039
McKay.

697
00:43:28,073 --> 00:43:29,407
How do you know she escaped?

698
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:30,876
Don't you read the paper?

699
00:43:30,909 --> 00:43:32,310
Do you know what happened
between Lindell and I?

700
00:43:32,343 --> 00:43:33,378
Of course I do.

701
00:43:33,411 --> 00:43:36,982
You know and yet you still
have me playing ping pong?

I need a bodyguard
and you're the best person

705
00:43:40,185 --> 00:43:40,952
for the job.

706
00:43:40,986 --> 00:43:41,787
Get someone else.

Look!

709
00:43:47,625 --> 00:43:55,701
I thought you'd jump
at this opportunity.

710
00:43:55,734 --> 00:44:06,144
It's about time
you showed up.

Mrs. Goddard.

713
00:44:21,092 --> 00:44:23,394
Why didn't you tell me
Lindell escaped?

714
00:44:23,428 --> 00:44:25,831
First of all McKay, you're not
a police officer anymore,

715
00:44:25,864 --> 00:44:27,799
it's none of your business. 
Second of all,

716
00:44:27,833 --> 00:44:29,901
I'm not your message service.

717
00:44:29,935 --> 00:44:31,669
I'll call you back later.

718
00:44:32,370 --> 00:44:35,040
[car running]
Hey!

719
00:44:45,483 --> 00:44:46,151
Is the plumber here yet?

720
00:44:46,184 --> 00:44:47,018
Yes.

721
00:44:47,052 --> 00:44:51,189
I believe he's upstairs
in the bathroom.

722
00:44:51,723 --> 00:45:01,967
* music 
Jesus!

723
00:45:01,967 --> 00:45:11,777
* music 
Jesus!

724
00:45:11,810 --> 00:45:13,812
I'm just here to fix
the toilet!

725
00:45:13,845 --> 00:45:15,713
Get out!

726
00:45:18,016 --> 00:45:19,150
[mini truck sped away]
[gate crashes]

727
00:45:25,791 --> 00:45:26,424
Hey partner!

728
00:45:26,457 --> 00:45:29,327
It's the toilet in the cabana.

729
00:45:32,363 --> 00:45:42,407
You got something
against plungers?

730
00:45:42,407 --> 00:45:49,514
You got something
against plungers?

731
00:45:49,547 --> 00:45:51,082
[birds chirping]
Nina!

732
00:46:00,025 --> 00:46:01,893
What a pleasant surprise!

733
00:46:01,927 --> 00:46:03,862
You're still a cocky bastard.

734
00:46:03,895 --> 00:46:07,365
You haven't lost any of
your charm, I see.

735
00:46:07,398 --> 00:46:11,436
Nina, we have so many
good memories in this bedroom.

736
00:46:11,469 --> 00:46:14,840
Are you sure you want to
spoil them like this?

737
00:46:14,873 --> 00:46:18,076
You know exactly what I want.

738
00:46:20,611 --> 00:46:21,813
[birds chirping]
Where's Hobbs?

739
00:46:33,158 --> 00:46:34,459
Upstairs.

740
00:46:48,940 --> 00:46:50,842
[chatting]
[fighting]

741
00:47:04,189 --> 00:47:06,357
De javu Ms. McKay.

742
00:47:08,894 --> 00:47:11,229
[gun firing]
[glass shattering]

743
00:47:15,233 --> 00:47:16,134
[gun firing]
[screams]

744
00:47:18,536 --> 00:47:20,005
[gun firing]
[window glass breaking]

745
00:47:23,008 --> 00:47:24,142
[thud]
Get him!

746
00:47:44,295 --> 00:47:45,496
[groans]

[fighting]
[water splashes]

749
00:48:57,202 --> 00:49:00,205
Look Isaac, you don't have to
play dumb with me.

750
00:49:00,238 --> 00:49:03,241
I already know you're an
arrogant son of a bitch!

751
00:49:03,274 --> 00:49:05,310
So just tell me where Nina is
'cause I know damn well

752
00:49:05,343 --> 00:49:10,581
you know. 
I'm losing my patience here.

753
00:49:10,615 --> 00:49:14,085
Definitely losing my patience.

754
00:49:14,119 --> 00:49:18,323
You don't want that to happen.

755
00:49:18,356 --> 00:49:22,227
Get him out of here.

756
00:49:22,260 --> 00:49:23,761
We're talking about
an escaped cop killer,

757
00:49:23,794 --> 00:49:24,795
Mr. Hobbs.

758
00:49:24,829 --> 00:49:26,397
I don't need to tell you
how dangerous this one is.

759
00:49:26,431 --> 00:49:27,732
No shit, Captain.

760
00:49:27,765 --> 00:49:30,735
I dated her for
a year and a half.

761
00:49:30,768 --> 00:49:32,437
Look!

762
00:49:32,470 --> 00:49:34,172
I have detectives
specially trained

763
00:49:34,205 --> 00:49:35,373
for this kind of thing.

764
00:49:35,406 --> 00:49:36,707
I want McKay.

765
00:49:36,741 --> 00:49:38,076
I can't authorize that.

766
00:49:38,109 --> 00:49:39,544
You don't have to.

767
00:49:39,577 --> 00:49:44,282
I'm hiring Ms. McKay
as my personal bodyguard.

768
00:49:44,315 --> 00:49:47,218
Mr. Hobbs,
this is Sergeant Ostendorf.

769
00:49:47,252 --> 00:49:51,456
He is one of my best men, sir.

770
00:49:51,489 --> 00:49:55,560
I don't know how many times
I have to go into this,

771
00:49:55,593 --> 00:49:57,062
but I want McKay.

772
00:49:57,095 --> 00:49:59,264
That's why I'm hiring her.

773
00:49:59,297 --> 00:49:59,997
Let me get this straight.

774
00:50:00,031 --> 00:50:02,200
You want a woman
protecting you?

775
00:50:02,233 --> 00:50:03,501
Yeah.

776
00:50:03,534 --> 00:50:07,672
Who would you rather be with
24 hours a day?

777
00:50:07,705 --> 00:50:09,340
He is a qualified 
professional.

778
00:50:09,374 --> 00:50:12,043
Yeah, but he is not as cute. 
Sorry sergeant.

779
00:50:12,077 --> 00:50:13,144
You're not funny.

780
00:50:13,178 --> 00:50:13,978
Look!

781
00:50:14,011 --> 00:50:14,979
I know you have to do
whatever you can

782
00:50:15,012 --> 00:50:16,714
to bring Lindell in,
but I don't want a bunch of

783
00:50:16,747 --> 00:50:18,749
rent-a-cops hanging around
my house eating donuts.

784
00:50:18,783 --> 00:50:21,219
I want somebody
who is dedicated.

785
00:50:21,252 --> 00:50:22,787
I want somebody who has
a personal stake in this

786
00:50:22,820 --> 00:50:24,322
and I want somebody who can
give me a massage

787
00:50:24,355 --> 00:50:25,656
once in a while.

788
00:50:31,096 --> 00:50:40,371
I can't believe
I'm on your side.

789
00:50:40,405 --> 00:50:42,240
[footsteps]
You're the cockiest person

790
00:50:42,273 --> 00:50:43,508
I've ever met.

791
00:50:43,541 --> 00:50:44,642
I didn't know
you're impressed.

792
00:50:44,675 --> 00:50:45,543
It's not a compliment.

793
00:50:45,576 --> 00:50:47,212
Yes, it is.

794
00:50:47,245 --> 00:50:48,379
Hey McKay!

795
00:50:48,413 --> 00:50:50,115
Wait up!

796
00:50:50,148 --> 00:50:52,683
Listen, if you find
something out, I wanna know.

797
00:50:52,717 --> 00:50:54,385
You're not an
investigator anymore.

798
00:50:54,419 --> 00:50:55,386
You wanna change that?

799
00:50:55,420 --> 00:50:58,389
Come and talk to me.

800
00:50:59,257 --> 00:51:00,458
Try to take care of this one
a little better than

801
00:51:00,491 --> 00:51:02,127
your last boyfriend.

802
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:03,228
Shut up.

803
00:51:03,261 --> 00:51:04,129
What?

804
00:51:04,929 --> 00:51:18,709
* music 
Here, let me get that

805
00:51:18,743 --> 00:51:19,577
for you.

806
00:51:19,610 --> 00:51:20,545
It's no problem.

807
00:51:20,578 --> 00:51:22,613
I want to.

808
00:51:22,647 --> 00:51:24,115
She's kinda cute, isn't she?

809
00:51:24,149 --> 00:51:25,650
Yes sir.

810
00:51:28,386 --> 00:51:29,620
[footsteps]
Here you are.

811
00:51:35,393 --> 00:51:36,794
Don't you have butlers
for that?

812
00:51:36,827 --> 00:51:38,496
They're busy.

813
00:51:38,529 --> 00:51:39,764
Room okay?

814
00:51:39,797 --> 00:51:41,566
It's fine.

815
00:51:41,599 --> 00:51:42,900
Make the house yours.

816
00:51:42,933 --> 00:51:45,770
Use everything, pool, jacuzzi,
game room.

817
00:51:45,803 --> 00:51:48,639
Everything a growing
playboy needs.

818
00:51:48,673 --> 00:51:52,377
Not everything.

819
00:51:52,410 --> 00:51:54,345
Excuse me.

820
00:51:54,379 --> 00:51:56,447
So, how'd you meet up
with Lindell?

821
00:51:56,481 --> 00:51:59,184
We have mutual
business associates.

822
00:51:59,217 --> 00:52:01,452
What kind of business.

823
00:52:01,486 --> 00:52:02,687
Am I in trial here?

824
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:04,222
Should you be?

825
00:52:04,255 --> 00:52:05,756
I have enough real money
Ms. McKay.

826
00:52:05,790 --> 00:52:06,924
I don't need the fake stuff.

827
00:52:06,957 --> 00:52:09,660
You didn't answer
my question.

828
00:52:09,694 --> 00:52:10,595
Plastics.

829
00:52:10,628 --> 00:52:13,531
Plastic forks, plastic spoons,
knives, cups.

830
00:52:13,564 --> 00:52:15,833
Plastic [indistinct]
Incorporated.

831
00:52:15,866 --> 00:52:17,902
My father founded it.

832
00:52:17,935 --> 00:52:19,670
You've been on a picnic McKay?

833
00:52:19,704 --> 00:52:21,806
You probably ate your
peanut butter and jelly

834
00:52:21,839 --> 00:52:24,375
sandwich off one of my plates.

835
00:52:24,409 --> 00:52:25,410
Plastic.

836
00:52:25,443 --> 00:52:27,712
It fits.

837
00:52:27,745 --> 00:52:31,449
Having this around
is not gonna help you.

838
00:52:31,482 --> 00:52:33,284
Suddenly
you're a psychiatrist?

839
00:52:33,318 --> 00:52:34,719
You're just easy to read.

840
00:52:34,752 --> 00:52:37,955
Listen up Hobbs, I'm not
here for you to read me,

841
00:52:37,988 --> 00:52:39,357
I'm not here to play ping pong.

842
00:52:39,390 --> 00:52:40,958
I'm here to keep you safe.

843
00:52:40,991 --> 00:52:43,528
So, if you wanna flirt,
just go find one of your

844
00:52:43,561 --> 00:52:44,695
little playmates.

845
00:52:44,729 --> 00:52:48,766
I'm not interested.

846
00:52:48,799 --> 00:52:50,335
Natasha.

847
00:52:50,368 --> 00:52:55,606
You remember their names?

848
00:52:55,640 --> 00:52:57,675
Breakfast is tomorrow, 9:00.

849
00:52:57,708 --> 00:53:00,411
Bring your good cheer.

850
00:53:00,445 --> 00:53:03,914
Hey Hobbs,
we have a problem.

851
00:53:03,948 --> 00:53:05,683
Who called the plumber?

852
00:53:05,716 --> 00:53:07,585
My staff takes care of that.

853
00:53:07,618 --> 00:53:09,654
I know my staff for years.

854
00:53:09,687 --> 00:53:11,322
Clayton all my life.

855
00:53:11,356 --> 00:53:14,459
Read somewhere else.

856
00:53:20,498 --> 00:53:21,866
Isaac Barry?

857
00:53:21,899 --> 00:53:24,602
He's in room 13.

858
00:53:24,635 --> 00:53:25,870
I want you to do me a favor.

859
00:53:25,903 --> 00:53:26,904
You keep an eye on McKay.

860
00:53:26,937 --> 00:53:28,539
That woman is a tight wire.

861
00:53:28,573 --> 00:53:30,308
If she snaps, God help 
whoever's around her.

862
00:53:30,341 --> 00:53:33,278
God help her
if she's around me.

863
00:53:33,311 --> 00:53:34,645
What do you have
against this lady?

864
00:53:34,679 --> 00:53:35,380
Off the record?

865
00:53:35,413 --> 00:53:36,814
Yes.

866
00:53:36,847 --> 00:53:38,649
There is a war going
in the streets, Captain.

867
00:53:38,683 --> 00:53:40,918
Now, I don't mind a female
sitting behind a desk

868
00:53:40,951 --> 00:53:42,853
pushing pencils,
but I don't want one

869
00:53:42,887 --> 00:53:44,522
in the battlefield with me.

870
00:53:44,555 --> 00:53:45,823
Hey it's the '90s.

871
00:53:45,856 --> 00:53:47,725
Woman don't put up
with that shit anymore.

872
00:53:51,629 --> 00:54:01,672
* music 
Well, well, well.

873
00:54:01,672 --> 00:54:07,378
* music 
Well, well, well.

874
00:54:07,412 --> 00:54:08,779
Look who's back in town.

875
00:54:08,813 --> 00:54:10,281
I've been looking for you.

876
00:54:10,315 --> 00:54:11,949
Been right here, darling.

877
00:54:11,982 --> 00:54:12,883
Let's talk.

878
00:54:13,651 --> 00:54:24,929
* music 
You know, ever since

879
00:54:24,962 --> 00:54:28,299
the shop was down, no one
seems to know where the plates

880
00:54:28,333 --> 00:54:29,767
have disappeared.

881
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:31,869
Stranger things
have happened.

882
00:54:31,902 --> 00:54:33,404
I want the plates.

883
00:54:33,438 --> 00:54:35,340
I don't have the plates,
maybe you ought to go

884
00:54:35,373 --> 00:54:36,674
talk to Hobbs.

885
00:54:36,707 --> 00:54:38,709
I'm working on that.

886
00:54:38,743 --> 00:54:40,545
Are you hiding something
from me?

887
00:54:40,578 --> 00:54:42,079
Listen baby,
if I had these plates,

888
00:54:42,112 --> 00:54:45,015
do you think I'd be
sitting here in this dive?

889
00:54:45,049 --> 00:54:45,783
Sorry.

890
00:54:45,816 --> 00:54:47,652
I'm a little tense.

891
00:54:47,685 --> 00:54:50,521
You know when a man
gets out of joints,

892
00:54:50,555 --> 00:54:53,458
he got a whole lot of pressure
he wants to be releasing.

893
00:54:53,491 --> 00:54:56,394
[chuckles]
I bet that's all you need.

894
00:54:56,427 --> 00:54:58,863
What do you say?

895
00:54:58,896 --> 00:55:02,099
I've got this burning fire
in my pants right now.

896
00:55:02,132 --> 00:55:04,469
We'll maybe we should
put it out.

897
00:55:04,502 --> 00:55:05,102
Yeah.

898
00:55:05,135 --> 00:55:06,471
[water poured]
Shit!

899
00:55:06,504 --> 00:55:08,473
Shit!

900
00:55:08,506 --> 00:55:09,740
Did I extinguish the fire?

901
00:55:09,774 --> 00:55:12,343

I did, ma'am.

Your alarm system is off.

but no one is

That's my responsibility 
ma'am.

918
00:56:08,132 --> 00:56:09,066
I apologize.

919
00:56:09,099 --> 00:56:10,501
I don't want an apology.

Yes ma'am.

That's what I call
a compliment.

926

Generally responded to with
a thank you or perhaps

927
00:56:34,592 --> 00:56:37,462
just a smile.

928
00:56:37,495 --> 00:56:39,797
Now, a smile is
a facial expression displaying

929

certain pleasant emotions
like happiness or affection.

930

heart attack when he was 12.

939
00:57:23,908 --> 00:57:26,877
It's my speculation that his
childhood was taken from him

01:08:59,236 --> 01:09:01,771
one hell of a police officer.

1083
01:09:01,805 --> 01:09:05,442
[sigh]
Do you ever feel your life is

1084
01:09:05,475 --> 01:09:10,414
falling apart piece by piece?

1085
01:09:10,447 --> 01:09:11,848
Mine fell apart.

1086
01:09:11,881 --> 01:09:16,653
I lost my mother, my father,
my brother is gone

1087
01:09:16,686 --> 01:09:22,692
and I'm still here.

1088
01:09:22,726 --> 01:09:29,699
So, you had a brother?

1089
01:09:29,733 --> 01:09:32,202
My brother was an artist.

1090
01:09:32,236 --> 01:09:33,770
He made this for me.

1091
01:09:33,803 --> 01:09:36,606
I called it the guardian angel.

1092
01:09:36,640 --> 01:09:38,275
She spreads her
protective wings over all those

1093
01:09:38,308 --> 01:09:41,311
who stand before it.

1094
01:09:41,345 --> 01:09:46,883
I guess she should have kept it
to protect himself.

1095
01:09:46,916 --> 01:09:49,953
Have you ever heard of
this place?

1096
01:09:49,986 --> 01:09:51,388
I'm looking for Nina Lindell.

1097
01:09:51,421 --> 01:09:53,223
Do you know her?

1098
01:09:53,257 --> 01:09:54,358
No.

1099
01:09:54,391 --> 01:10:01,598
You can check the guy
at the phone though.

1100
01:10:01,631 --> 01:10:02,432
Yeah.

1101
01:10:02,466 --> 01:10:03,267
I'll be home soon.

1102
01:10:03,300 --> 01:10:04,768
I'm taking care of business
right now.

1103
01:10:04,801 --> 01:10:05,201
Yeah.

1104
01:10:05,235 --> 01:10:06,403
I love you, too.

1105
01:10:06,436 --> 01:10:07,871
Bye.

1106
01:10:08,605 --> 01:10:10,740
Come on chuckledick,
you're up.

1107
01:10:10,774 --> 01:10:15,345
Alright, alright.

1108
01:10:15,379 --> 01:10:18,014
Hey, you know
even handicapped, I can still

1109
01:10:18,047 --> 01:10:19,616
whip all your assess.

1110
01:10:19,649 --> 01:10:21,751
[laughter]
What about me?

1111
01:10:21,785 --> 01:10:24,554
You think you can whip mine?

1112
01:10:24,588 --> 01:10:26,490
I can do a whole lot more
than that darling.

1113
01:10:26,523 --> 01:10:27,491
Oh, yeah!

1114
01:10:27,524 --> 01:10:29,759
You can roast some marshmallows
over his crotch.

1115
01:10:29,793 --> 01:10:31,461
Shut up Jimmy Lee!

1116
01:10:31,495 --> 01:10:32,862
Rack 'em, big boy.

1117
01:10:32,896 --> 01:10:37,601
Huh, how 'bout if I rack you
instead, darling?

1118
01:10:37,634 --> 01:10:38,768
I'm looking for
an old friend.

1119
01:10:38,802 --> 01:10:40,337
Her name is Nina Lindell.

1120
01:10:40,370 --> 01:10:41,638
Have you seen her?

1121
01:10:41,671 --> 01:10:42,706
Hey Jake!

1122
01:10:42,739 --> 01:10:45,609
Didn't you have a barbecue
with her the other night?

1123
01:10:45,642 --> 01:10:49,279
I said can it,
Jimmy Lee!

1124
01:10:49,313 --> 01:10:51,014
And who the hell are you?

1125
01:10:51,047 --> 01:10:52,916
I told you, I'm an old friend.

1126
01:10:52,949 --> 01:10:55,652
So, have you seen her recently?

1127
01:10:55,685 --> 01:10:59,656
Listen bitch, why don't you
just get the hell out of here.

1128
01:10:59,689 --> 01:11:03,827
I like it when you
talk nasty to me.

1129

When did you see Lindell?

1136
01:12:07,591 --> 01:12:08,858
Go to hell.

1137
01:12:08,892 --> 01:12:10,894
[groans]
No!

1138
01:12:10,927 --> 01:12:11,595
Where is she?

1139
01:12:11,628 --> 01:12:12,662
I don't know.

1140
01:12:12,696 --> 01:12:13,797
She was looking for the plates.

1141
01:12:13,830 --> 01:12:15,732
What plates?

1142
01:12:15,765 --> 01:12:16,533
The counterfeit plates.

1143
01:12:16,566 --> 01:12:17,667
What do you think?

1144
01:12:17,701 --> 01:12:21,471
I told her I didn't know
where they were but Hobbs does.

You lied to me Hobbs.

1149
01:12:51,868 --> 01:12:52,702
She does not want you.

1150
01:12:52,736 --> 01:12:54,804
She wants the plates.

1151
01:12:54,838 --> 01:13:00,777
I met a good buddy of yours,
Jake Burback.

1152
01:13:00,810 --> 01:13:03,513
Come with me.

1153
01:13:03,547 --> 01:13:05,415
I wanna show you something.

1154
01:13:05,449 --> 01:13:06,750
I can't wait.

1155
01:13:07,484 --> 01:13:15,959
* music 
His name is David.

1156
01:13:15,992 --> 01:13:18,428
He had a counterfeit operation
with Nina.

1157
01:13:18,462 --> 01:13:20,964
She shot him
and left him for dead.

1158
01:13:20,997 --> 01:13:23,032
He has been here ever since.

1159
01:13:29,172 --> 01:13:30,540
[footsteps]
How do you know this guy?

1160
01:13:33,477 --> 01:13:35,579
He's my brother.

1161
01:13:38,648 --> 01:13:41,585
Hey David.

1162
01:13:41,618 --> 01:13:45,188
I brought a friend today.

1163
01:13:45,221 --> 01:13:46,990
This is Kristine.

1164
01:13:47,023 --> 01:13:50,159
Hi.

1165
01:13:50,193 --> 01:13:50,994
Lawton.

1166
01:13:51,027 --> 01:13:51,961
Yeah.

1167
01:13:51,995 --> 01:13:54,564
I'm back in business.

1168
01:13:54,598 --> 01:13:56,600
Oh really.

1169
01:14:00,570 --> 01:14:02,138
She cool?

1170
01:14:02,171 --> 01:14:04,674
She's cool.

1171
01:14:04,708 --> 01:14:06,943
[paper crinkling]
What do you think we can

1172
01:14:08,778 --> 01:14:19,222
get for these on the street?

1173
01:14:19,255 --> 01:14:21,525
I don't know.

1174
01:14:21,558 --> 01:14:24,193
I've seen better. 
[paper snapped]

1175
01:14:24,227 --> 01:14:26,663
Shit.

1176
01:14:26,696 --> 01:14:28,532
It's because they don't
give me the proper materials,

1177
01:14:28,565 --> 01:14:29,666
Christ.

1178
01:14:29,699 --> 01:14:33,637
I can't do good work with
crayons, but what can I do?

1179
01:14:33,670 --> 01:14:35,071
I just can't just ask for ink.

1180
01:14:35,104 --> 01:14:39,509
[laughter]
They'll know what I'm doing

1181
01:14:39,543 --> 01:14:40,309
in here.

1182
01:14:40,343 --> 01:14:43,847
[laughter]
These are really bad, huh?

1183
01:14:50,820 --> 01:14:53,056
Yeah.

1184
01:14:53,089 --> 01:14:55,959
David,
can I ask you a question?

1185
01:14:55,992 --> 01:14:57,727
I guess.

1186
01:14:57,761 --> 01:15:00,029
Where did you put the plates?

1187
01:15:00,063 --> 01:15:04,668
[Laughing]
What!

1188
01:15:07,170 --> 01:15:09,238
You brought a cop in here.

1189
01:15:09,272 --> 01:15:10,940
How could you do this to me?

1190
01:15:10,974 --> 01:15:14,578
[laughter]
I'm busted big time.

1191
01:15:14,611 --> 01:15:16,680
David.

1192
01:15:16,713 --> 01:15:21,551
She is not a cop.

1193
01:15:21,585 --> 01:15:25,622
So, where are the plates?

1194
01:15:25,655 --> 01:15:28,024
Would you like to know?

1195
01:15:28,057 --> 01:15:29,926
I hid them a long time ago.

1196
01:15:29,959 --> 01:15:32,662
Way before they threw me
in this [indistinct]

1197
01:15:32,696 --> 01:15:37,233
[laughter]
Everybody wanted them 'cause

1198
01:15:37,266 --> 01:15:39,869
they were so good.

1199
01:15:39,903 --> 01:15:43,039
You know Lindell is out
of jail.

1200
01:15:43,072 --> 01:15:47,143
[startled scream]
David.

1201
01:15:56,252 --> 01:15:59,555
Get the nurse.

1202
01:16:05,862 --> 01:16:07,597
Level with me, Hobbs.

1203
01:16:07,631 --> 01:16:08,865
Were you involved in this?

1204
01:16:08,898 --> 01:16:10,867
Of course I wasn't involved.

1205
01:16:10,900 --> 01:16:12,969
It's just David.

1206
01:16:13,002 --> 01:16:14,704
He always wanted to make it
on his own.

1207
01:16:14,738 --> 01:16:18,975
[car door opening]
You know, you're the only

1208
01:16:19,008 --> 01:16:23,880
person who knows about him,
who knows he is alive.

Neighbors came by and
found the door open.

1215
01:17:24,073 --> 01:17:28,678
I'm sorry.

1216
01:17:29,746 --> 01:17:30,479
Where is the neighbor?

1217
01:17:30,513 --> 01:17:31,214
I don't want to hear
another word.

1218
01:17:31,247 --> 01:17:31,848
Nothin'.

1219
01:17:31,881 --> 01:17:32,949
You're not a police officer.

1220
01:17:32,982 --> 01:17:34,718
This is not your jurisdiction.

1221
01:17:34,751 --> 01:17:36,820
Shut up!

1222
01:17:36,853 --> 01:17:38,321
Damn it.

1223
01:17:38,354 --> 01:17:41,891
Leave him alone.

1224
01:17:42,325 --> 01:17:43,092
Calm down.

1225
01:17:43,126 --> 01:17:44,460
Get the hell out of here 
everyone!

1226
01:17:44,493 --> 01:17:48,431
Just get the hell out--
Calm down!

1227
01:17:48,464 --> 01:17:50,066
You get out.

1228
01:17:50,099 --> 01:17:51,768
Okay, you're fired.

1229
01:17:51,801 --> 01:17:53,169
What?

1230
01:17:53,202 --> 01:17:54,738
You're fired.

1231
01:17:54,771 --> 01:17:58,374
Now, get the hell out.

1232
01:17:58,407 --> 01:18:00,810
You're out of this picture 
McKay.

1233
01:18:00,844 --> 01:18:02,145
Lawton.

1234
01:18:02,178 --> 01:18:03,847
You wanna get killed?

1235
01:18:03,880 --> 01:18:05,414
She is after everyone.

1236
01:18:05,448 --> 01:18:07,951
She killed Clayton,
my brother.

1237
01:18:07,984 --> 01:18:09,385
I don't want that to happen 
to you.

1238
01:18:09,418 --> 01:18:13,056
I'm your bodyguard.

1239
01:18:13,089 --> 01:18:15,458
Not anymore.

1240
01:18:20,263 --> 01:18:23,099
Listen up McKay, from now on
Sergeant Ostendorf here

1241
01:18:23,132 --> 01:18:24,801
will be assigned to
protect Mr. Hobbs.

1242
01:18:24,834 --> 01:18:25,835
So, stay out of it.

1243
01:18:26,736 --> 01:18:36,980
* music 
Well, now that we got McKay

1244
01:18:36,980 --> 01:18:46,990
* music 
Well, now that we got McKay

1245
01:19:21,524 --> 01:19:23,292
out of the way,
maybe we'll make some progress.

1246
01:19:23,326 --> 01:19:26,095
What you'd say there Hobbs?

1247
01:19:26,129 --> 01:19:28,164
I got to ask you something.

1248
01:19:28,197 --> 01:19:31,567
Why would a man
want a female bodyguard?

1249
01:19:31,600 --> 01:19:36,005
Shit, boy, where's your pride?

1250
01:19:36,039 --> 01:19:38,241
Let me ask you something.

1251
01:19:38,274 --> 01:19:42,011
Are you a sexist asshole
because you can't get laid

1252
01:19:42,045 --> 01:19:46,382
or because you're secretly
attracted to men?

1253
01:19:46,415 --> 01:19:48,918
You're not funny.

1254
01:19:50,319 --> 01:20:04,567
* music 
Well, here we are again,

1255
01:20:04,600 --> 01:20:07,003
just the two of us.

1256
01:20:07,036 --> 01:20:08,905
Tell me something Flash.

1257
01:20:08,938 --> 01:20:10,606
Why am I so stupid?

1258
01:20:10,639 --> 01:20:13,109
I can't believe I actually
started to care for that...

1259
01:20:13,142 --> 01:20:13,576
that...

1260
01:20:13,609 --> 01:20:14,643
[dog whimpering].

1261
01:20:14,677 --> 01:20:17,413
Why'd you let me feel that way? 
You know he's so...

1262
01:20:17,446 --> 01:20:20,316
He's just so egotistical. 
He's childish.

1263
01:20:20,349 --> 01:20:21,450
He's pompous.

1264
01:20:21,484 --> 01:20:24,587
He's spoiled and you know
he just thinks he's so funny.

1265
01:20:24,620 --> 01:20:28,357
[dog whimpering]
So what if he is charming.

1266
01:20:28,391 --> 01:20:33,529
[dog whimpering]
Yeah, he's handsome, tall,

1267
01:20:33,562 --> 01:20:35,398
sincere.

1268
01:20:35,431 --> 01:20:36,966
Well, if you think
he's so sexy,

1269
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:40,436
why don't you go out with him?

1270
01:20:40,469 --> 01:20:43,106
Do you think people get
a second chance?

1271
01:20:43,139 --> 01:20:44,373
Well then get off your butt
and do something.

1272
01:20:44,407 --> 01:20:46,876
Come on, let's go.

1273
01:20:46,910 --> 01:20:48,177
[dog whimpering]
Hi David, how you doing?

1274
01:20:56,285 --> 01:20:58,187
Do you remember me?

1275
01:20:58,221 --> 01:21:03,059
You probably don't want to, 
right?

1276
01:21:03,092 --> 01:21:09,933
You know your brother
cares so much for you.

1277
01:21:09,966 --> 01:21:11,167
I don't know if you can
hear me,

1278
01:21:11,200 --> 01:21:12,435
but I think there is something
that you really

1279
01:21:12,468 --> 01:21:14,637
ought to know.

1280
01:21:14,670 --> 01:21:16,973
The same woman
that shot you, well,

1281
01:21:17,006 --> 01:21:18,541
she is trying to kill Lawton.

1282
01:21:18,574 --> 01:21:20,910
The only thing that can
save him is getting those

1283
01:21:20,944 --> 01:21:22,411
counterfeit plates.

1284
01:21:22,445 --> 01:21:24,680
That's what she wants.

1285
01:21:24,713 --> 01:21:25,348
I'll level with you.

1286
01:21:25,381 --> 01:21:28,584
I was a cop, but not anymore.

1287
01:21:28,617 --> 01:21:34,623
I quit.

1288
01:21:34,657 --> 01:21:38,962
She killed someone
really close to me.

1289
01:21:38,995 --> 01:21:41,297
I'm not gonna let that
happen again.

1290

You need to help me.

1293
01:22:01,717 --> 01:22:03,419
Do you understand?

1294
01:22:03,452 --> 01:22:07,123
Do you understand
what I'm telling you?

1295
01:22:07,156 --> 01:22:10,994
Please.

1296
01:22:11,027 --> 01:22:12,428

[helicopter]
Look.

1298
01:22:35,184 --> 01:22:40,023
She's hurt us both.

1299
01:22:40,056 --> 01:22:50,099
David, your brother
needs your help.

1300
01:22:50,099 --> 01:22:57,240

Are you an angel?

1302

I'm Kristine McKay.

1303
01:23:43,286 --> 01:23:45,254
I'm just trying to help.

1304
01:23:45,288 --> 01:23:55,664
I already have
a police officer helping me.

1305
01:23:55,698 --> 01:23:58,501
Where are you going asshole?

Goddard.

1307
01:24:09,345 --> 01:24:10,646
I'm on my way.

1308
01:24:17,753 --> 01:24:18,821
Hello again...

1309
01:24:18,854 --> 01:24:19,855
Nina.

1310
01:24:19,888 --> 01:24:21,324
Oh, it's good to see you.

1311
01:24:21,357 --> 01:24:22,525
Let me make you a drink.

1313
01:24:36,239 --> 01:24:38,174
Ostendorf,
you want a drink too?

1314
01:24:38,207 --> 01:24:40,209
[groans]
Is that a no?

1315
01:24:44,447 --> 01:24:45,714
[groans]
For the last time,

1316
01:24:47,183 --> 01:24:50,253
where are the plates?

1317
01:24:50,286 --> 01:24:51,254
In the china cabinet.

1319
01:25:02,331 --> 01:25:04,133
Why are you hiding them?

1320
01:25:04,167 --> 01:25:05,868
You don't use them.

1321
01:25:05,901 --> 01:25:07,436
You're hiding something.

1322
01:25:07,470 --> 01:25:08,871
Someone else knows
where they are.

1323
01:25:08,904 --> 01:25:09,905
Am I right?

1324
01:25:09,938 --> 01:25:11,707
You're reaching for shit now,
Nina.

1325
01:25:11,740 --> 01:25:14,277
You're the one person who'll
know where the plates were.

[groans]
[gun clicks]

1327

Where are the plates?

1328

Drop your guns.

1329
01:25:28,691 --> 01:25:30,459
[footsteps]
What're you gonna do McKay?

1330
01:25:32,795 --> 01:25:34,230
Kill another cop?

1331
01:25:34,263 --> 01:25:35,864
You're damn right.

Thank you.

Start it up.

on my desk tomorrow morning.

1351
01:31:55,744 --> 01:31:57,713
I didn't know
I was coming back.

1352
01:31:57,746 --> 01:31:59,748
I did.

I guess so.

1358
01:32:28,243 --> 01:32:29,812
What if I need protection?

1359
01:32:29,845 --> 01:32:31,880
Don't you carry that
in your wallet?

1360
01:32:31,914 --> 01:32:34,883
[chuckles]
Yeah.

1361

Oh.
