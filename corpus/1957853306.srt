00:14:39,581 --> 00:14:41,048
We missed you today.

180
00:14:43,484 --> 00:14:45,319
Had a really good time
with Matilda.

181
00:14:45,352 --> 00:14:46,654
- [Nicolas] Yeah?
- Yeah.

182
00:14:47,955 --> 00:14:49,423
We talked about going to Brazil.

183
00:14:49,456 --> 00:14:51,091
- [Nicolas] Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

184
00:14:51,125 --> 00:14:54,261
- [Nicolas] Brazil.
- Yes, yes, yes. [sighs]

185
00:14:55,195 --> 00:14:58,132
I'd love to surf the waves
out there, man. [chuckles]

186
00:15:19,086 --> 00:15:20,287
Life.

187
00:15:20,688 --> 00:15:23,123
I mean, everything
has an influence on me.

188
00:15:23,157 --> 00:15:25,959
Women, men. You. Um...

189
00:15:26,193 --> 00:15:28,061
You have to steal

190
00:15:28,095 --> 00:15:31,131
because if you don't steal,
you cannot really do it.

191
00:15:31,165 --> 00:15:32,734
I mean, there are people who
think that they are original,

192
00:15:32,767 --> 00:15:33,967
but, um...

193
00:15:35,202 --> 00:15:36,236
they are not.

194
00:15:37,672 --> 00:15:40,240
I'm curious about your portrait
of the famous writer,

195
00:15:40,274 --> 00:15:41,709
Terry Collins.

196
00:15:41,975 --> 00:15:45,012
You... You bring
something new of him.

197
00:15:45,312 --> 00:15:46,614
Uh... [chuckles]

198
00:15:47,247 --> 00:15:49,249
A coolness
I've never seen before.

199
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:52,520
What is it that you put
from your personality

200
00:15:52,554 --> 00:15:53,655
into your images?

201
00:15:56,624 --> 00:15:59,326
Nothing is personal, Nicolas.

202
00:15:59,359 --> 00:16:00,994
[Nicolas]
<i>Everything is personal.</i>

203
00:16:01,028 --> 00:16:02,296
Every moment of
my existence is personal.

204
00:16:02,329 --> 00:16:04,031
- I'm a person.
- <i>I've worked with you</i>

205
00:16:04,064 --> 00:16:06,433
since you were 17,
and this is ridiculous.

206
00:16:06,967 --> 00:16:09,504
Maybe you need a vacation.
How do you feel?

207
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:12,005
Don't lie to me, Nicolas.

208
00:16:13,207 --> 00:16:14,509
And everything is bullshit.

209
00:16:15,442 --> 00:16:18,111
I am trying to help you.

210
00:16:18,746 --> 00:16:21,583
You know you are my number one.

211
00:16:21,616 --> 00:16:23,016
<i>Our number one.</i>

212
00:16:23,618 --> 00:16:28,021
The world sees fashion's
superficial.

213
00:16:28,055 --> 00:16:30,190
It's a strange world
of business, you know?

214
00:16:30,224 --> 00:16:32,459
Do you know how many copies
my book sold?

215
00:16:32,493 --> 00:16:35,329
The client was unhappy
with your last...

216
00:16:35,362 --> 00:16:37,030
- Fuck the client.
- But we have to work

217
00:16:37,064 --> 00:16:38,600
with these people.
It's part of the job.

218
00:16:38,633 --> 00:16:40,502
<i>They want something new.</i>

219
00:16:40,535 --> 00:16:42,469
They said
your photographs were...

220
00:16:42,704 --> 00:16:44,539
Were too dark.
Not enough colors.

221
00:16:44,572 --> 00:16:46,741
<i>They wanted to have fun.</i>

222
00:16:47,307 --> 00:16:50,110
They said your photographs don't
pop like they used to.

223
00:16:50,143 --> 00:16:51,713
You were a thousand miles away.

224
00:16:51,746 --> 00:16:53,715
You need a creative reset.

225
00:16:53,748 --> 00:16:55,683
<i>I don't know. Take Matilda
to Europe or something.</i>

226
00:16:55,717 --> 00:16:57,384
Try something new.

227
00:16:57,417 --> 00:16:59,353
Yeah, I don't need your help.

228
00:16:59,386 --> 00:17:01,523
Do you really believe
you're at the top of your game?

229
00:17:02,222 --> 00:17:03,658
- Fuck it.
- Okay, we're done here.

230
00:17:04,358 --> 00:17:05,259
Great.

231
00:17:06,861 --> 00:17:09,062
Can you define what you do?

232
00:17:13,735 --> 00:17:17,271
No. I don't want to define
what I do,

233
00:17:17,304 --> 00:17:19,072
and I don't like to define
what I'm doing.

234
00:17:19,106 --> 00:17:20,173
Um...

235
00:17:20,542 --> 00:17:22,677
I create. That's it.

236
00:17:28,850 --> 00:17:30,117
So what's your next project?

237
00:17:32,486 --> 00:17:34,756
I'm still working on it,
but you'll be the first to know.

238
00:17:39,827 --> 00:17:42,062
Do you even have
another project?

239
00:17:42,530 --> 00:17:44,632
[director] Here we go.
Quiet, please. Thank you.

240
00:17:44,666 --> 00:17:47,669
[indistinct chatter]

241
00:17:47,702 --> 00:17:49,504
[director] Roll sound.
Thank you.

242
00:17:49,537 --> 00:17:50,705
[indistinct chatter]

243
00:17:50,738 --> 00:17:52,574
[woman] Sam's meeting you.

244
00:17:53,575 --> 00:17:55,242
[moving lips silently]

245
00:18:04,484 --> 00:18:06,386
[male narrator on TV]
<i>Butterflies usually attempt</i>

246
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:09,256
<i>to accumulate around
the base of the tongue.</i>

247
00:18:09,289 --> 00:18:11,325
<i>They don't hold
their tongue too straight</i>

248
00:18:11,358 --> 00:18:13,795
<i>like other types of flies.</i>

249
00:18:13,828 --> 00:18:16,196
<i>They curl it and...</i>

250
00:18:16,229 --> 00:18:17,799
<i>even more remarkably.</i>

251
00:18:17,832 --> 00:18:20,233
<i>They can put a sharp bend in it.</i>

252
00:18:20,267 --> 00:18:22,402
<i>These butterflies
have got pollen,</i>

253
00:18:22,436 --> 00:18:25,238
<i>not necessarily on its tongue,</i>

254
00:18:25,272 --> 00:18:27,609
<i>but all over
its pretty legs as well.</i>

[birds chirping on TV]

256
00:20:06,908 --> 00:20:09,544
[Cassandra] You once called me
your "Eternal Tiger."

257
00:20:11,579 --> 00:20:15,315
[Nicolas] <i>Cassandra</i>
<i>was my greatest love.</i>

[Cassandra]
<i>These flowers will fade</i>

259
00:20:17,985 --> 00:20:19,921

<i>We both thought we would</i>

<i>If you believe...</i>

<i>I'll never leave you Nicolas.</i>

I can't live with you anymore.

I fucked him.

So, it's finding balance
between, um, life and art.

286

Honesty always
gets my attention.

287
00:21:40,701 --> 00:21:42,870
Not particularly someone
who is honest to me,

288
00:21:42,904 --> 00:21:44,839
but someone who is honest
with himself.

00:21:51,112 --> 00:21:52,580

Hmm.

292
00:21:55,415 --> 00:21:57,585
Take it in. I'm...
I'm really proud of you.

293
00:21:58,986 --> 00:22:01,088
Yeah, but still,
I want to be something more.

What do you mean by that?

296

- Do you remember what happened?
- Mm-hmm.

302
00:22:26,714 --> 00:22:28,783
You became a photographer.

303
00:22:28,816 --> 00:22:31,351
You were obsessed
with taking pictures.

304
00:22:31,886 --> 00:22:33,120
I envied that, man.

305
00:22:34,055 --> 00:22:35,790
I really did.

- I know.
- I do.

307
00:22:36,958 --> 00:22:38,092
- I do.
- It's not enough.

308
00:22:42,196 --> 00:22:44,464
There's a fashion bubble
that needs to be burst.

309
00:22:46,567 --> 00:22:48,468
Fashion photography
holds me down.

310
00:22:48,970 --> 00:22:50,104
What do you mean?

311
00:22:52,573 --> 00:22:53,875
I don't know.

312

- You know?
- It's crazy.

00:23:03,184 --> 00:23:04,151
Just...

316
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:08,055
You got to find it in you,
you know?

317
00:23:10,457 --> 00:23:12,093
That's the tough part.

318
00:23:12,126 --> 00:23:13,794
- Impossible.
- [both laugh]

319
00:23:15,863 --> 00:23:19,934

I have to be completely honest
with you.

325

I need to know
how you grind your beans.

00:26:55,783 --> 00:26:57,818
-It was a good party,
-Did Cedric have fun?

355
00:26:58,986 --> 00:26:59,987
I think so.

356
00:27:01,689 --> 00:27:02,923
Did you call your mother back?

357
00:27:06,994 --> 00:27:08,295
I think it'd be good if she
stayed with us

358
00:27:08,329 --> 00:27:09,396
for a couple of days.

359
00:27:13,167 --> 00:27:14,869
I'd like to get
to know her better

360
00:27:14,902 --> 00:27:16,170
and last time she came
it was a bit weird.

361
00:27:17,471 --> 00:27:18,973
Weird?

362
00:27:19,541 --> 00:27:22,009
I didn't know it was a problem
for you to speak to your mother.

363
00:27:25,779 --> 00:27:27,381
Why are you shutting me
out of your life?

364
00:27:28,215 --> 00:27:29,216
What do you mean?

365
00:27:30,117 --> 00:27:31,652
This is life.

366
00:27:50,905 --> 00:27:52,006
Mm.

367
00:27:52,706 --> 00:27:55,709
Is this the last gasp
of a dying artist?

368
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:14,962
[woman] <i>Do you believe in fate?</i>

369
00:28:17,097 --> 00:28:18,432
[Cedric] <i>Are you serious?</i>
[laughs]

370
00:28:23,204 --> 00:28:24,238
If I'm honest.

371
00:28:25,372 --> 00:28:26,407
Which I try to be.

372
00:28:29,276 --> 00:28:30,377
[woman laughs]

373
00:28:31,845 --> 00:28:33,414
Only when everything good
happens to me.

374
00:28:39,153 --> 00:28:40,421
[woman chuckling]

375
00:28:49,263 --> 00:28:50,464
Hey.

376
00:28:57,338 --> 00:28:58,906
Do you want some coffee?

377
00:29:00,207 --> 00:29:01,742
[crying]

378
00:29:02,977 --> 00:29:04,111
[sniffles]

379
00:29:06,981 --> 00:29:09,149
[breathes deeply]

380
00:29:09,416 --> 00:29:10,518
[sniffles]

381
00:29:18,959 --> 00:29:19,994
[cell phone vibrating]

382
00:29:23,397 --> 00:29:26,000
- It's Serena.
- Tell her I said hi.

383
00:29:26,867 --> 00:29:28,102
Hey, Serena.

384
00:29:32,507 --> 00:29:34,174
[woman] I am gonna
get ready for work.

385
00:29:34,509 --> 00:29:35,843
I'll be right back.

386
00:29:38,546 --> 00:29:40,014
[sobs]

387
00:29:40,447 --> 00:29:44,451
He went for a wave, and...

388
00:29:45,386 --> 00:29:47,454
he went down, and he...

389
00:29:54,228 --> 00:29:55,462
[no audio]

390
00:30:08,375 --> 00:30:10,811
- [seagulls screeching]
- [water gushing]

391
00:30:33,033 --> 00:30:34,201
[Nicolas]
<i>Do you remember Sophie?</i>

392
00:30:35,369 --> 00:30:36,403
[Cedric] <i>Who?</i>

393
00:30:37,338 --> 00:30:38,238
I don't know.

394
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:40,508
[both laugh hysterically]

395
00:30:45,079 --> 00:30:47,181
No, no. Can we be
serious for a moment

396
00:30:47,214 --> 00:30:48,982
because it's really important?

397
00:30:49,016 --> 00:30:50,585
- I need to tell you.
- Yeah, I am listening.

398
00:30:51,586 --> 00:30:52,486
You are?

399
00:30:53,655 --> 00:30:55,055
Yeah?

400
00:30:55,289 --> 00:30:56,357
- Sophie.
- Mm-hmm.

401
00:31:02,564 --> 00:31:03,631
- Paul's mom?
- Oh, yeah.

402
00:31:06,066 --> 00:31:07,535
Paul's mom, man.

403
00:31:08,168 --> 00:31:10,037
- [laughing hysterically]
- Yeah.

404
00:31:11,673 --> 00:31:15,008
- Paul's mom. Fuck.
- Paul's mom, dude.

405
00:31:15,042 --> 00:31:17,077
- She was hot.
- She was hot.

406
00:31:18,445 --> 00:31:19,547
What?

407
00:31:20,582 --> 00:31:21,882
It's just that...

408
00:31:23,150 --> 00:31:24,485
I don't know.

409
00:31:24,853 --> 00:31:26,320
I mean,
she kind of looks like Paul.

410
00:31:26,755 --> 00:31:29,056
- [laughs]
- She does?

411
00:31:29,089 --> 00:31:30,290
Yeah, a little bit, I mean...

412
00:31:30,692 --> 00:31:33,127
- Yeah.
- No, she doesn't.

413
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:34,895
<i>- No.</i>
- [Cedric] <i>But tell me about it.</i>

414
00:31:36,296 --> 00:31:38,600
I got... I got the no.

415
00:31:42,537 --> 00:31:44,171
[Cedric] <i>Ah.</i>

416
00:31:46,541 --> 00:31:48,543
The greatest sadness

417
00:31:49,209 --> 00:31:51,945
is not being able to kiss
an invisible woman.

418
00:31:54,314 --> 00:31:55,416
[mouth moving wordlessly]

419
00:31:56,551 --> 00:31:57,951
We cannot touch it.

420
00:32:00,487 --> 00:32:01,656
[chuckles]

421
00:32:03,525 --> 00:32:05,025
I think we should go.

422
00:32:07,161 --> 00:32:08,663
- Where's the key?
- You know where key is?

423
00:32:08,863 --> 00:32:10,497
I don't know.
You were just driving.

424
00:32:20,374 --> 00:32:21,275
[Nicolas crying] Sorry.

425
00:32:22,209 --> 00:32:23,143
I am so sorry.

426
00:32:38,125 --> 00:32:39,627
You look so much
like your father.

427
00:32:49,637 --> 00:32:52,540
Why don't you come with me to
New York for a couple of days?

428
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:54,007
We talked about that, remember?

429
00:32:55,175 --> 00:32:56,310
And it's not a good idea.

430
00:32:56,778 --> 00:32:58,345
Why?

431
00:32:58,378 --> 00:32:59,313
Because it's not.

432
00:32:59,346 --> 00:33:00,481
I'm loving you.

433
00:33:01,549 --> 00:33:03,116
I care about you.

434
00:33:04,051 --> 00:33:07,154
You mean everything to me.
And I don't have anything else.

435
00:33:07,622 --> 00:33:09,624
- [voice breaks] I am sorry.
- Okay.

436
00:33:11,593 --> 00:33:13,528
- [cries] I love you.
- Me too.

437
00:33:15,162 --> 00:33:16,731
I don't want to be without you.

438
00:33:23,538 --> 00:33:26,741
Look... Okay, come here

439
00:33:28,810 --> 00:33:30,612
[speaking indistinctly]

440
00:33:32,212 --> 00:33:33,313
Take care.

441
00:33:39,253 --> 00:33:40,354
Take care.

442
00:33:50,832 --> 00:33:52,165
[crying continues]

443
00:34:53,226 --> 00:34:54,796
I can't believe
I'm never going to see Cedric

444
00:34:54,829 --> 00:34:56,229
walking over here again.

445
00:34:57,865 --> 00:35:00,133
Nothing means anything anymore.

446
00:35:02,269 --> 00:35:03,370
I know.

447
00:35:07,709 --> 00:35:08,843
This is fucking chaos.

448
00:35:11,445 --> 00:35:12,747
[speaks softly]
Please don't leave me.

449
00:35:13,347 --> 00:35:14,682
I won't.

450
00:35:16,283 --> 00:35:18,519
- I can't do this all alone.
- [speaks softly] I know.

451
00:35:20,420 --> 00:35:21,789
I know.

452
00:35:29,396 --> 00:35:30,397
[knock on door]

453
00:35:45,312 --> 00:35:46,446
[woman] <i>What's wrong?</i>

454
00:35:58,826 --> 00:36:00,360
[Nicolas] <i>Everything's wrong.</i>

455
00:36:00,394 --> 00:36:01,629
[woman] <i>What do you mean</i>
<i>everything?</i>

456
00:36:06,801 --> 00:36:08,770
I want you...

457
00:36:09,504 --> 00:36:10,672
to fuck...

458
00:36:17,578 --> 00:36:18,813
You're home.

459
00:36:27,822 --> 00:36:29,189
[sniffles]

460
00:36:32,492 --> 00:36:33,628
I love you.

461
00:36:38,331 --> 00:36:39,867
It's okay to be lost.

462
00:36:52,580 --> 00:36:57,585
[Matilda] <i>My dispirited lover</i>

463
00:36:59,821 --> 00:37:01,321
<i>Your patterns</i>

464
00:37:02,690 --> 00:37:03,925
<i>Are fading.</i>

465
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:08,896
<i>I'm wandering</i>

466
00:37:10,665 --> 00:37:11,899
<i>Wistful</i>

467
00:37:13,534 --> 00:37:14,501
<i>Nicolas</i>

468
00:37:15,570 --> 00:37:16,604
<i>Where are...</i>

469
00:37:16,637 --> 00:37:17,839
Thank you.

470
00:37:19,607 --> 00:37:21,274
I feel pretty good.

471
00:37:21,308 --> 00:37:22,342
[woman]
<i>Is something bothering you?</i>

472
00:37:28,415 --> 00:37:30,985
- [Nicolas clears throat]
- [woman] Photoshoot was crazy.

473
00:37:31,018 --> 00:37:32,920
You argued with the clients.

474
00:37:32,954 --> 00:37:34,789
You left the studio.

475
00:37:34,822 --> 00:37:36,691
It was very awkward
between you and the model.

476
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:41,461
[Nicolas] How is your life?

477
00:37:41,495 --> 00:37:42,462
Are you still in love?

478
00:37:43,998 --> 00:37:45,499
It's complicated.

479
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:47,467
[chuckles]

480
00:37:47,501 --> 00:37:48,703
<i>We still love each other, but...</i>

481
00:37:48,736 --> 00:37:50,303
Come on.

482
00:37:50,905 --> 00:37:52,507
[model] something is broken.

483
00:37:53,741 --> 00:37:55,442
[Nicolas] Look at me.

484
00:37:55,475 --> 00:37:56,577
- <i>So what?</i>
- [shutter clicks]

485
00:37:56,978 --> 00:37:58,746
Clients are usually uptight.

486
00:37:59,046 --> 00:38:01,616
What happened?

487
00:38:01,649 --> 00:38:03,951
<i>Well, you need
to impose yourself just...</i>

488
00:38:05,653 --> 00:38:07,420
<i>take control
and don't give a shit.</i>

489
00:38:07,454 --> 00:38:08,589
[woman] <i>Don't be so aggressive,</i>
<i>Nicolas.</i>

490
00:38:08,623 --> 00:38:10,658
[Nicolas] Don't move.

491
00:38:10,691 --> 00:38:12,660
[Cassandra] You're just gonna
stare at me and judge me, right?

492
00:38:12,693 --> 00:38:15,096
That's... That's your position.

493
00:38:15,129 --> 00:38:16,998
<i>How do you live like this?</i>

494
00:38:17,031 --> 00:38:18,933
[model] <i>Yes, he seems</i>
<i>to be changing now.</i>

495
00:38:18,966 --> 00:38:21,736
<i>You know, I don't care anymore.</i>

496
00:38:21,769 --> 00:38:24,906
<i>I have been disrespected
for a long time.</i>

497
00:38:25,873 --> 00:38:28,375
[Nicolas] Okay, that's good.
Move up. Are you afraid of me?

498
00:38:28,408 --> 00:38:29,977
- Maybe you let me out.
- [Nicolas] Are you scared?

499
00:38:30,011 --> 00:38:31,444
<i>Oh, I hit a nerve.</i>

500
00:38:33,948 --> 00:38:35,315
[shutter clicking]

501
00:38:35,917 --> 00:38:37,484
You okay? [sniffles]

502
00:38:37,685 --> 00:38:39,821
[model] You are so mean to me.

503
00:38:39,854 --> 00:38:43,791
Fuck off Nicolas
you fucking little brat.

504
00:38:43,825 --> 00:38:45,827
You're fucking selfish.

505
00:38:45,860 --> 00:38:47,094
[model] <i>Do you have any secrets?</i>

506
00:38:57,437 --> 00:38:58,873
[Nicolas sniffles,
clears throat]

507
00:39:04,645 --> 00:39:05,947
You make me sick!

508
00:39:12,954 --> 00:39:14,487
[Nicolas]
This is not what I want.

509
00:39:15,422 --> 00:39:16,724
Do something new.

510
00:39:16,757 --> 00:39:18,659
I have seen this.
Do something new.

511
00:39:20,027 --> 00:39:22,997
Don't touch me.
Don't touch me.

512
00:39:23,631 --> 00:39:25,833
I don't wanna shoot
with you anymore.

513
00:39:27,467 --> 00:39:28,669
You're making me crazy.

514
00:39:35,109 --> 00:39:36,644
[model]
<i>Don't touch me.</i>

515
00:39:39,614 --> 00:39:41,448
[Cassandra]
<i>How do you live like this?</i>

516
00:39:43,450 --> 00:39:44,819
[model]
<i>Let me out...</i>

517
00:39:46,954 --> 00:39:48,122
[chuckles]

518
00:40:02,003 --> 00:40:03,905
Aren't you afraid
that people are going to see

519
00:40:03,938 --> 00:40:05,072
what a fraud you are?

520
00:40:06,874 --> 00:40:08,042
You know what I see?

521
00:40:10,044 --> 00:40:11,078
Fear.

522
00:40:14,916 --> 00:40:16,416
You waltz in here...

523
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:21,822
like you're
some kind of magician.

524
00:40:31,666 --> 00:40:32,800
Hey.

525
00:40:35,903 --> 00:40:37,004
[clatter]

526
00:40:37,038 --> 00:40:38,706
Hey, what are you doing?

527
00:40:45,079 --> 00:40:47,048
You're pretending to ask me
what am I doing,

528
00:40:47,081 --> 00:40:49,150
but the real question is,
why am I doing it?

529
00:40:49,183 --> 00:40:50,483
Right?

530
00:40:52,987 --> 00:40:54,121
Why I am working?

531
00:40:56,991 --> 00:40:58,092
Yeah?

532
00:41:01,562 --> 00:41:02,563
Because I can.

533
00:41:17,745 --> 00:41:20,114
I am sorry. I am sorry.

534
00:41:25,853 --> 00:41:27,487
Let's drink wine and make love.

535
00:41:29,190 --> 00:41:31,592
I'm gonna go outside first
and get some air.

536
00:41:31,625 --> 00:41:32,827
[Nicolas] No.

537
00:41:32,860 --> 00:41:34,595
- Nicolas, stop now.
- No.

538
00:41:35,029 --> 00:41:36,163
You're hurting me.

539
00:41:37,865 --> 00:41:39,166
Shh.

540
00:41:39,767 --> 00:41:40,868
Please.

541
00:41:42,236 --> 00:41:43,604
Hey...

542
00:42:04,959 --> 00:42:06,794
Something you can fix.

543
00:42:16,904 --> 00:42:18,239
Hit me.

544
00:42:20,674 --> 00:42:21,575
No?

545
00:42:23,077 --> 00:42:24,311
You like that?

546
00:42:25,279 --> 00:42:26,914
I break things.

547
00:42:26,947 --> 00:42:28,115
You clean up.

548
00:42:29,083 --> 00:42:31,619
No? You don't like it?

549
00:42:35,256 --> 00:42:36,857
Okay.

550
00:42:37,658 --> 00:42:40,861
I don't want to irritate you,
but you're an artist.

551
00:42:40,895 --> 00:42:43,164
You write poems. You are good.

552
00:42:43,197 --> 00:42:44,799
Yeah, so?

553
00:42:44,832 --> 00:42:46,333
You can't even
believe yourself now.

554
00:42:46,367 --> 00:42:48,035
You want to teach me
how to live my life?

555
00:42:48,069 --> 00:42:49,303
You want to teach me
how to survive?

556
00:42:50,204 --> 00:42:51,572
Go ahead. Come on.

557
00:42:54,108 --> 00:42:56,677
Come on. You believe
that you are better than me?

558
00:42:56,710 --> 00:42:58,145
You are not better than me.

559
00:42:58,746 --> 00:43:01,182
Forget about us.
We don't exist.

560
00:43:01,215 --> 00:43:02,750
Get out of my face.

561
00:43:02,783 --> 00:43:04,285
- Fuck you, Matilda.
- Hey!

562
00:43:05,419 --> 00:43:06,854
Fuck you!

563
00:43:07,321 --> 00:43:08,956
You know what it is, Nicolas?

564
00:43:10,157 --> 00:43:11,692
You're afraid.

565
00:43:12,426 --> 00:43:14,628
And you can't even see it
because you're so arrogant.

566
00:43:14,662 --> 00:43:16,330
Fucking look at yourself
right now!

567
00:43:18,032 --> 00:43:19,800
I am sorry.

568
00:43:23,871 --> 00:43:25,372
Stop it.

569
00:43:25,406 --> 00:43:26,740
- Don't fucking touch me.
- Fuck off.

570
00:43:28,709 --> 00:43:29,910
Get out.

571
00:43:30,111 --> 00:43:31,278
Go. Let me work now.

572
00:43:35,416 --> 00:43:36,984
It's 8:00AM!

573
00:43:37,952 --> 00:43:39,286
[whimpers]

574
00:43:40,955 --> 00:43:42,323
Stop it.

575
00:43:48,996 --> 00:43:50,364
[exhales heavily]

576
00:43:52,700 --> 00:43:54,368
[sniffles, sighs]

577
00:43:57,171 --> 00:43:59,340
[woman] <i>Are you daydreaming?</i>

578
00:44:03,344 --> 00:44:04,945
You don't know shit.

579
00:44:04,979 --> 00:44:06,780
When are you going
to get fucking real?

580
00:44:06,814 --> 00:44:09,383
And you better get real,
fucking fast.

581
00:44:12,019 --> 00:44:13,287
[woman shouting indistinctly]

582
00:44:41,916 --> 00:44:43,117
[urinating]

583
00:44:48,756 --> 00:44:49,857
[flush]

584
00:44:51,926 --> 00:44:52,960
Matilda.

585
00:46:07,835 --> 00:46:09,403
[cell phone ringing]

586
00:46:16,877 --> 00:46:17,545
Hello?

587
00:46:20,114 --> 00:46:21,282
Matilda?

588
00:46:23,350 --> 00:46:24,418
Hello?

589
00:46:28,355 --> 00:46:29,490
[telephone ringing]

590
00:46:36,497 --> 00:46:41,001
Are you Nicolas Yarna?

591
00:46:41,035 --> 00:46:43,037
<i>Are you wondering
where Matilda is?</i>

592
00:46:43,070 --> 00:46:45,039
<i>I'll ask you a final time.</i>

593
00:46:45,072 --> 00:46:47,007
<i>Are you wondering
where Matilda is?</i>

594
00:46:48,942 --> 00:46:50,578
- <i>Do I have your attention?</i>
- Yes.

595
00:46:50,844 --> 00:46:55,082
Meet me at the Hotel Vista Tide
at 9 p.m.

596
00:46:55,115 --> 00:46:59,153
<i>Room 1009.1009.
The door will be open.</i>

597
00:46:59,186 --> 00:47:00,522
<i>Do you understand?</i>

598
00:47:00,755 --> 00:47:02,156
What the fuck is this?

599
00:47:04,526 --> 00:47:05,959
<i>Did you hear something?</i>

600
00:48:25,673 --> 00:48:27,274
[door opens]

601
00:48:36,083 --> 00:48:37,284
- [telephone ringing]
- [door closes]

602
00:48:41,355 --> 00:48:43,323
[ringing continues]

603
00:48:52,132 --> 00:48:54,001
Where is Matilda?

604
00:48:54,034 --> 00:48:55,235
[woman] <i>Good, you can</i>
<i>follow instructions.</i>

605
00:48:56,236 --> 00:48:58,005
[Nicolas]
Where is she?

606
00:48:58,038 --> 00:49:00,274
<i>You keep asking
the wrong questions.</i>

607
00:49:00,307 --> 00:49:03,545
Besides, anticipation
is the greatest pleasure.

608
00:49:04,044 --> 00:49:06,213
If you don't tell me
where Matilda is, I'm going to...

609
00:49:06,246 --> 00:49:07,615
Do tell, Mr. Yarna.

610
00:49:08,449 --> 00:49:09,617
What are you going to do?

611
00:49:11,519 --> 00:49:15,289
That's the sound of a man
realizing he's not in control.

612
00:49:18,292 --> 00:49:19,694
[Nicolas] Who is this
and what do you want?

613
00:49:22,630 --> 00:49:24,064
Where is she?

614
00:49:25,499 --> 00:49:27,034
Is she okay?

615
00:49:27,067 --> 00:49:29,403
When things
start to feel strange,

616
00:49:29,436 --> 00:49:32,640
<i>you should stop and check
your surroundings.</i>

617
00:49:32,674 --> 00:49:33,641
[woman hangs up the phone]

618
00:49:45,319 --> 00:49:46,554
[woman's voice in Nicolas' head]
<i>When things start</i>

619
00:49:46,588 --> 00:49:49,189
<i>to feel strange,</i>

620
00:49:49,223 --> 00:49:51,726
<i>you should stop and check
your surroundings.</i>

621
00:50:00,702 --> 00:50:02,202
[woman] <i>It's a lovely dress.</i>

622
00:50:04,204 --> 00:50:07,207
Unfortunately she wore it
under those circumstances.

623
00:50:19,587 --> 00:50:21,154
<i>Are you wondering</i>

624
00:50:21,188 --> 00:50:22,189
<i>where Matilda is?</i>

625
00:50:29,296 --> 00:50:30,698
<i>Do I have your attention?</i>

626
00:50:42,376 --> 00:50:44,144
[bees buzzing]

627
00:50:47,615 --> 00:50:49,116
[cell phone ringing]

628
00:50:58,125 --> 00:50:58,826
[Nicolas] Yes?

629
00:51:00,460 --> 00:51:02,764
[woman] <i>Don't worry.</i>

630
00:51:02,797 --> 00:51:05,833
<i>It's easy to lose
when it's weighing us down.</i>

631
00:51:33,160 --> 00:51:35,863
<i>Darkness extinguishes light.</i>

632
00:51:39,667 --> 00:51:41,335
<i>They can coexist.</i>

633
00:51:50,745 --> 00:51:52,479
<i>The light has left you.</i>

634
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:15,268
Do you know where she is?
She's lost.

635
00:52:16,638 --> 00:52:18,472
[door closes]

636
00:52:18,506 --> 00:52:20,775
[woman]
<i>All luminescence, eventually,</i>

637
00:52:20,808 --> 00:52:22,777
<i>fades to this.</i>

638
00:52:25,847 --> 00:52:27,882
Are you daydreaming?

639
00:52:32,854 --> 00:52:35,188
[woman] <i>I know</i>
<i>what you dream at night.</i>

640
00:52:37,324 --> 00:52:39,359
I don't ever want
to hear your voice again.

641
00:52:48,435 --> 00:52:49,904
[jazz music playing]

642
00:52:52,874 --> 00:52:54,441
I apologize.

643
00:52:54,876 --> 00:52:56,544
You were looking for
some peace and quiet.

644
00:52:56,577 --> 00:52:57,912
It's okay.

645
00:53:01,816 --> 00:53:03,417
I haven't seen you here before.

646
00:53:04,886 --> 00:53:06,486
It's the first time.

647
00:53:06,821 --> 00:53:08,455
I spend too much time here.

648
00:53:11,959 --> 00:53:14,461
Did you know the only part of
the human body

649
00:53:14,494 --> 00:53:15,897
that requires sleep

650
00:53:16,531 --> 00:53:17,932
is the brain?

651
00:53:19,033 --> 00:53:21,435
You can... run,

652
00:53:22,837 --> 00:53:25,840
walk, fuck...

653
00:53:28,710 --> 00:53:29,744
twenty-four hours a day.

654
00:53:32,279 --> 00:53:34,381
Just the brain
that can't keep up.

655
00:53:34,414 --> 00:53:36,316
I'm most tired when I travel.

656
00:53:37,685 --> 00:53:39,687
I'm so excited to leave. But...

657
00:53:40,320 --> 00:53:42,957
when I arrive at my destination,
it's my brain.

658
00:53:44,659 --> 00:53:46,226
There's a tough time adapting.

659
00:53:51,699 --> 00:53:52,834
I'm Hannah.

660
00:53:54,035 --> 00:53:55,235
Nicolas.

661
00:53:56,436 --> 00:53:57,538
It's nice to meet you.

662
00:53:57,805 --> 00:53:58,940
You too.

663
00:54:00,575 --> 00:54:01,709
May I tell you a story?

664
00:54:05,780 --> 00:54:07,882
It's funny, I promise.

665
00:54:11,085 --> 00:54:12,754
When I was 16,

666
00:54:14,488 --> 00:54:16,657
there was this 31 year old
that I was dating.

667
00:54:18,593 --> 00:54:19,994
On a trip to Norway,

668
00:54:21,361 --> 00:54:22,997
we found this small town

669
00:54:23,030 --> 00:54:26,801
surrounded by 100 tiny lakes.

670
00:54:29,369 --> 00:54:30,437
All of a sudden, I...

671
00:54:32,439 --> 00:54:34,709
I felt the urge to make love
with him for the first time.

672
00:54:37,078 --> 00:54:38,546
I was still a virgin.

673
00:54:40,915 --> 00:54:42,984
That part of the forest
was dangerous

674
00:54:43,551 --> 00:54:46,687
because there was a species
of man-eating wolves.

675
00:54:48,823 --> 00:54:50,323
I undressed...

676
00:54:52,860 --> 00:54:54,529
he entered inside of me,

677
00:54:55,963 --> 00:54:58,498
and we were
waving our flashlights

678
00:54:58,533 --> 00:55:00,500
and making all these
strange noises

679
00:55:01,235 --> 00:55:03,571
so that the wolves
would stay away.

680
00:55:04,572 --> 00:55:05,840
[chuckles]

681
00:55:07,575 --> 00:55:09,544
I dream about that sometimes

682
00:55:09,977 --> 00:55:11,779
when I'm making love
to other men.

683
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:14,549
And when it happens, I...

684
00:55:15,216 --> 00:55:17,384
have to stop having sex.
[scoffs]

685
00:55:18,653 --> 00:55:21,354
Because my burst
of laughter goes on

686
00:55:21,388 --> 00:55:22,957
without ever coming
to a stop. [chuckles]

687
00:55:26,761 --> 00:55:28,029
[both chuckle]

688
00:55:34,869 --> 00:55:36,336
I'm going to go for a swim.

689
00:55:39,439 --> 00:55:40,440
[Hannah chuckles softly]

690
00:55:52,086 --> 00:55:53,588
[Hannah] <i>You have a secret.</i>

691
00:55:55,923 --> 00:55:57,058
<i>I'm psychic.</i>

692
00:56:09,937 --> 00:56:11,873
Relax, you can tell me.

693
00:56:13,007 --> 00:56:14,374
Relax.

694
00:56:18,512 --> 00:56:20,480
- We all have them.
- [Nicolas] I've lost something.

695
00:56:21,582 --> 00:56:24,952
Something or someone?

696
00:56:29,824 --> 00:56:32,693
My girlfriend, she's gone.

697
00:56:35,696 --> 00:56:37,031
She's left you

698
00:56:37,531 --> 00:56:40,034
or she's gone missing?

699
00:56:43,004 --> 00:56:46,707
I'm at the hotel because I
got a strange phone call.

700
00:56:46,741 --> 00:56:48,408
I hoped it was Matilda.

701
00:56:51,212 --> 00:56:52,613
Who was it?

702
00:56:53,480 --> 00:56:55,016
[Nicolas] I was beginning
to think it was you.

703
00:56:55,049 --> 00:56:56,150
[Hannah laughs]

704
00:56:57,952 --> 00:56:59,754
No, that's too cruel.

705
00:57:02,957 --> 00:57:04,025
Even for me.

706
00:57:08,129 --> 00:57:10,463
I went to this room
and I got a call...

707
00:57:12,199 --> 00:57:13,534
but it was cryptic.

708
00:57:15,870 --> 00:57:17,104
[Hannah]
And you have no other clues?

709
00:57:17,872 --> 00:57:19,006
Nothing.

710
00:57:26,914 --> 00:57:29,083
That there's nothing
to be gained by being here?

711
00:57:40,995 --> 00:57:42,163
You coming?

712
00:58:39,954 --> 00:58:40,921
[beep]

713
00:58:45,993 --> 00:58:47,528
[door lock clicks]

714
00:58:57,772 --> 00:58:59,907
I have the package
for Mr. Yorke.

715
00:59:05,212 --> 00:59:07,581
You are an hour late.

716
00:59:12,153 --> 00:59:13,287
[Hannah] I understand that.

717
00:59:15,623 --> 00:59:16,857
I'm sorry.

718
00:59:29,236 --> 00:59:30,571
He's here to learn.

719
00:59:32,706 --> 00:59:33,908
No more mistakes.

720
00:59:37,211 --> 00:59:38,646
[man scrubbing an object]

721
00:59:44,218 --> 00:59:45,219
[knock on door]

722
00:59:52,193 --> 00:59:53,227
- Hello.
- Thomas.

723
00:59:59,233 --> 01:00:01,302
This is my new friend, Nicolas.

724
01:00:03,037 --> 01:00:04,271
Nicolas.

725
01:00:05,773 --> 01:00:07,208
My name is Thomas.

726
01:00:07,241 --> 01:00:08,242
How about a drink?

727
01:00:08,543 --> 01:00:10,377
Scotch, bourbon, rye?

728
01:00:11,078 --> 01:00:12,746
Soda pop?

729
01:00:12,780 --> 01:00:14,048
[Nicolas] Are you having
a glass of scotch?

730
01:00:14,815 --> 01:00:15,816
Maybe.

731
01:00:17,852 --> 01:00:18,752
Come in.

732
01:00:25,059 --> 01:00:26,360
Sit down.

733
01:00:29,897 --> 01:00:31,899
I've missed talking to you
in person.

734
01:00:33,200 --> 01:00:34,668
When did you get back
from India?

735
01:00:34,702 --> 01:00:35,402
India?

736
01:00:36,871 --> 01:00:38,372
Uh, about a week ago, I think.

737
01:00:40,040 --> 01:00:41,375
I was there for six months.

738
01:00:42,176 --> 01:00:43,277
India.

739
01:00:44,879 --> 01:00:46,280
Have to go back in January.

740
01:00:48,749 --> 01:00:49,850
[speaks softly] Thank you.

741
01:00:49,884 --> 01:00:51,018
- Nicolas.
- Thank you.

742
01:00:53,454 --> 01:00:54,855
And where are you from?

743
01:00:56,357 --> 01:00:59,960
I was born in Naples, but when I
was ten, I moved to New York.

744
01:00:59,994 --> 01:01:00,895
Um-hmm.

745
01:01:02,229 --> 01:01:03,164
Where are you now?

746
01:01:06,133 --> 01:01:07,201
I'm in Los Angeles.

747
01:01:13,107 --> 01:01:14,074
Where are you?

748
01:01:19,280 --> 01:01:20,881
Where are you?

749
01:01:23,417 --> 01:01:25,119
Don't you mean I just told you?

750
01:01:27,388 --> 01:01:29,323
Was New York stressful to you?

751
01:01:32,293 --> 01:01:34,328
Uh, no.

752
01:01:34,361 --> 01:01:36,330
Uh, I like to change.

753
01:01:36,363 --> 01:01:38,098
I used to travel a lot.

754
01:01:38,132 --> 01:01:39,433
Nicolas is a photographer.

755
01:01:40,301 --> 01:01:42,036
So you're an artist. Ah.

756
01:01:43,237 --> 01:01:44,872
So you're an artist.

757
01:01:45,239 --> 01:01:46,440
I'm interested in people.

758
01:01:47,107 --> 01:01:48,175
[scoffs softly]

759
01:01:49,443 --> 01:01:50,344
What are you most afraid of?

760
01:01:54,415 --> 01:01:56,050
I don't need to be
analyzed right now,

761
01:01:56,083 --> 01:01:58,452
but thank you for your interest.

762
01:02:02,990 --> 01:02:06,327
Uh, are you afraid to see
who you really are?

763
01:02:08,195 --> 01:02:11,365
Is it because you are afraid
to see who you are?

764
01:02:13,167 --> 01:02:14,401
Strange.

765
01:02:15,936 --> 01:02:17,871
I see you're
interested in people,

766
01:02:17,905 --> 01:02:19,373
but you are cut off
from yourself.

767
01:02:23,043 --> 01:02:24,512
Living and dying.

768
01:02:24,546 --> 01:02:26,514
Identical twins in the Matrix.

769
01:02:28,082 --> 01:02:29,383
Shadow and light.

770
01:02:29,584 --> 01:02:30,851
Light and shadow.

771
01:02:32,486 --> 01:02:35,422
You know how that feels,
don't you, Nicolas?

772
01:02:38,560 --> 01:02:40,160
- Excuse me.
- [Thomas chuckles]

773
01:02:41,128 --> 01:02:42,463
If I say childhood,

774
01:02:44,331 --> 01:02:45,466
what comes to mind?

775
01:02:45,499 --> 01:02:47,801
[Hannah] I think
it's time to go.

776
01:02:47,835 --> 01:02:49,436
- [Nicolas] <i>What?</i>
- [Thomas] <i>I think you heard me.</i>

777
01:02:49,470 --> 01:02:50,771
[Hannah] That's enough.

778
01:02:51,372 --> 01:02:52,540
We're going.

779
01:02:58,212 --> 01:02:59,947
This was a mistake. Sorry.

780
01:03:04,285 --> 01:03:05,252
Good night.

781
01:03:09,591 --> 01:03:11,292
Wicked people of the night.

782
01:03:11,325 --> 01:03:12,527
[door opens]

783
01:03:15,162 --> 01:03:17,031
[whispers] Mr. Yorke
doesn't like it

784
01:03:17,064 --> 01:03:18,399
when his plans change.

785
01:03:24,004 --> 01:03:26,541
[Thomas] <i>Wicked</i>
<i>people of the night.</i>

786
01:03:33,247 --> 01:03:34,882
[birds chirping]

787
01:03:37,619 --> 01:03:39,019
[Nicolas] <i>I'm beginning to...</i>

788
01:03:41,422 --> 01:03:43,490
<i>forget the shape of your face...</i>

789
01:03:46,327 --> 01:03:47,961
<i>Where am I?</i>

790
01:03:51,365 --> 01:03:53,000
<i>I hear things...</i>

791
01:03:55,502 --> 01:03:56,937
<i>you once said to me.</i>

792
01:03:58,472 --> 01:04:00,374
<i>Spoken.</i>

793
01:04:00,407 --> 01:04:02,409
<i>By unfamiliar faces.</i>

794
01:04:02,443 --> 01:04:04,912
[woman] <i>We're alive when we</i>
<i>just fall from the sky.</i>

795
01:04:07,348 --> 01:04:09,116
[Cedric] <i>It was</i>
<i>an almost perfect wave.</i>

796
01:04:10,417 --> 01:04:13,087
<i>I got this feeling,</i>

797
01:04:13,120 --> 01:04:14,589
<i>this rush, like...</i>

798
01:04:16,990 --> 01:04:18,192
<i>I was a part of everything.</i>

799
01:04:19,460 --> 01:04:21,028
You know,
I didn't exist anymore.

800
01:04:24,198 --> 01:04:25,966
And I froze.

801
01:04:25,999 --> 01:04:28,402
<i>Time stood still.</i>

802
01:04:28,435 --> 01:04:34,208
[woman] <i>What shape is your heart</i>
<i>when it's really, really broken?</i>

803
01:04:35,543 --> 01:04:36,511
<i>There is no shape.</i>

804
01:04:37,978 --> 01:04:39,547
<i>Because it's an illusion...</i>

805
01:04:41,482 --> 01:04:45,119
<i>until you know you are...</i>

806
01:04:45,152 --> 01:04:50,190
<i>Why do you feel life is strange
when it gets really strange?</i>

807
01:04:54,662 --> 01:04:56,130
What if I fail?

[woman] <i>We loved.</i>

809
01:05:01,736 --> 01:05:03,137
<i>From hate.</i>

810
01:05:03,170 --> 01:05:05,072
Stop it. Don't fucking touch me.

811
01:05:05,105 --> 01:05:06,541
<i>And because
we set things on fire.</i>

812
01:05:08,442 --> 01:05:11,579
What if... I took it

813
01:05:11,613 --> 01:05:12,680
and it was the ride of my life?

814
01:05:16,751 --> 01:05:18,520
I knew I'd never
have that chance again.

815
01:05:21,523 --> 01:05:23,056

816

<i>When things start
to feel strange...</i>

820
01:05:32,567 --> 01:05:35,035
<i>you should probably stop</i>

821
01:05:35,068 --> 01:05:36,571
<i>and check your surroundings.</i>

822
01:05:56,156 --> 01:05:57,357
Hannah.

823
01:06:03,598 --> 01:06:04,699
Is she dead?

824

[Nicolas sighs]

825
01:06:07,501 --> 01:06:08,670
I know her.

826
01:06:10,070 --> 01:06:11,506
I have been working with her.

827
01:06:16,778 --> 01:06:19,179
<i>You are the woman on the phone.</i>

828
01:06:19,213 --> 01:06:21,281
<i>I want the truth</i>

<i>It's your turn now.</i>

[Nicolas] <i>Who do you</i>
<i>think you're fooling?</i>

831
01:06:26,286 --> 01:06:28,288
<i>I mean,
what is all this charade?</i>

832
01:06:28,489 --> 01:06:29,724
The least you can do
is be honest with me.

833
01:06:30,390 --> 01:06:31,759
Where's Matilda?

834
01:06:33,327 --> 01:06:36,196
[detective] <i>I don't know.</i>

835
01:06:36,230 --> 01:06:38,600
[Nicolas] <i>Since I saw you</i>
<i>in that black and white movie,</i>

836
01:06:38,633 --> 01:06:41,201
<i>my life was unraveled.</i>

837
01:06:41,235 --> 01:06:42,236
[Hannah]
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

838
01:06:43,370 --> 01:06:44,404
[Nicolas] <i>I don't know.</i>

839
01:06:45,707 --> 01:06:46,774
<i>Do I need a lawyer?</i>

840
01:06:49,276 --> 01:06:51,378
[detective] Only guilty people
need lawyers.

841
01:06:52,547 --> 01:06:53,748
Never mind about her.

842
01:06:56,450 --> 01:06:57,652
[Thomas] <i>Shadow and light.</i>

843
01:06:59,453 --> 01:07:02,189

Take care of yourself.

01:07:10,464 --> 01:07:11,666
<i>Fear.</i>

<i>You have never seen the victim

852
01:07:25,880 --> 01:07:27,347
<i>What's your relationship
to Hannah?</i>

853
01:07:27,381 --> 01:07:29,316
There's a hell
of a lot you don't know.

854
01:07:30,618 --> 01:07:32,252
When was the last time
you saw her?

855
01:07:32,286 --> 01:07:33,621
You're that pretty boy

856
01:07:33,655 --> 01:07:35,590
fashion photographer,
aren't you?

857
01:07:35,623 --> 01:07:38,492
You're the one that
takes all those pictures

858
01:07:38,526 --> 01:07:42,062
of that gorgeous girls for
<i>Details</i> magazine, am I right?

859
01:07:44,766 --> 01:07:45,767
You hate <i>Details?</i>

860
01:07:46,668 --> 01:07:47,835
[chuckles]

861
01:07:48,368 --> 01:07:49,537
No.

862
01:07:50,905 --> 01:07:52,607
I've read about you.

863
01:07:53,675 --> 01:07:55,375
Seen all your interviews.

864
01:07:56,544 --> 01:07:59,179
Talking about the truth
like you intended.

865
01:08:00,113 --> 01:08:03,818
So I got to look people in
the eye, criminals, thieves,

866
01:08:04,652 --> 01:08:07,555
liars, degenerates.

867
01:08:07,922 --> 01:08:09,691
I got to look for the truth
in their eyes,

868
01:08:09,724 --> 01:08:11,491
day in, day out.

869
01:08:11,893 --> 01:08:13,628
Usually, I don't find it...

870
01:08:14,829 --> 01:08:17,197
but every so often.

871
01:08:18,298 --> 01:08:19,399
I see the truth...

872
01:08:21,501 --> 01:08:23,136
and I know it.

873
01:08:23,437 --> 01:08:24,606
So I'll tell you what.

874
01:08:26,173 --> 01:08:27,809
Why don't we start this again...

875
01:08:29,777 --> 01:08:33,113
and you give me some
of that truth for a change, huh?

876
01:08:38,519 --> 01:08:40,287
You're a photographer.

877
01:08:40,320 --> 01:08:42,790
You think you see the truth,
but you don't.

878
01:08:42,991 --> 01:08:44,592
Your camera sees it.

879
01:08:45,059 --> 01:08:47,160
I don't got no fancy camera.

880
01:08:49,396 --> 01:08:51,331
Now get the fuck out of here.
Go.

881
01:08:53,200 --> 01:08:54,902
Oh, one more thing.

882
01:08:57,672 --> 01:08:58,873
[scoffs softly]

883
01:09:05,713 --> 01:09:07,515
Aren't you afraid
that people are going to see

884
01:09:07,548 --> 01:09:08,783
what a fraud you are?

885
01:09:21,729 --> 01:09:23,463
[male narrator on TV]
<i>Butterflies usually attempt</i>

<i>They don't hold
their tongue too straight</i>

888
01:09:28,368 --> 01:09:30,672
<i>like other types of flies.
They...</i>

<i>These butterflies have got...</i>
