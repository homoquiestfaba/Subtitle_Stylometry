1
00:01:33,134 --> 00:01:39,932
Here we have 121 divided by 9,
Then we get Y,

2
00:01:42,227 --> 00:01:43,971
Someone?

3
00:01:47,106 --> 00:01:53,905
That there is a replacement, meaning
cell phones are not allowed,

4
00:01:54,031 --> 00:01:58,823
No cell phones among the l ,,, es,

Jessica and I made love,
Now it's weird, What should I do?

10
00:02:34,111 --> 00:02:38,905
It seems that Mr, Lawrence three
days in Vegas partying,

11
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:44,954
Thanks for the notice,
Jimmy, Put it away,

12
00:02:45,081 --> 00:02:47,406

You're welcome, Is your relationship
stable than I will ever have,

00:03:05,394 --> 00:03:07,848
That's right,

17
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:14,604
Oops, Sorry, I have these
receive, Hello, darling,

18
00:03:14,735 --> 00:03:19,030
Do not call me 'baby',
- What's wrong with that?

19
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:24,865
Nicknames for couples,
- Sure, And do we have?

20
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:29,032
Not exactly courtship,
- But what do we have?

21
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:33,328
A conversation?
- Yes, we are talking to each other,

22
00:03:33,463 --> 00:03:36,334
We do not go out with each other,
- Wait, What?

23
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:41,757
I do not talk about this now, but
can you do me a favor?

24
00:03:41,889 --> 00:03:46,597
Want to have lunch with me?
I left my card at home lying,

25
00:03:47,144 --> 00:03:54,937
Sure, And then to The Mill?
Something to eat and maybe karaoke?

26
00:03:55,735 --> 00:04:02,105
Maybe I should go,
Can you hurry? I'm hungry,

27
00:04:05,329 --> 00:04:10,406
Yes, I love you,
Eskimo Kisses,

28
00:04:12,544 --> 00:04:17,252
That was my girlfriend,
We are in love, so ,,, smile,

29
00:04:42,574 --> 00:04:44,733
Sorry,
- Yes?

30
00:04:45,701 --> 00:04:53,247
Hypothetically, if a young bachelor
The literature teacher would vervangen-

31
00:04:54,211 --> 00:04:58,836
which book here would be him
best help?

32
00:05:01,802 --> 00:05:05,300
I think this is best,
- Oh, "Vampire Bats",

33
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:07,637
Amazing, Very helpful,

34
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:10,425
Are you a replacement?

35
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:15,223
How well do you get there from, but yes,
Hello, my name is Quinn,

36
00:05:15,356 --> 00:05:17,184
Hello, T,J,
- Nice to meet you,

37
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:21,778
Say, that's not a job for a
65-year-old hearing-impaired lady?

38
00:05:22,488 --> 00:05:27,031
Yes, Or for science students
who have to pay their education,

39
00:05:27,161 --> 00:05:32,284
I've never seen before,
- I just started as a teacher,

40
00:05:32,415 --> 00:05:35,417
Third grade social studies,
- Henderson's class?

41
00:05:35,543 --> 00:05:38,165
Yes,
- I replaced her last month,

42
00:05:38,297 --> 00:05:43,005
Gabe Willis, Real asshole,
- Yeah, a terrible guy,

43
00:05:43,302 --> 00:05:49,720
Can you give him a slap?
- For you, for me, for America,

44
00:05:49,932 --> 00:05:55,805
Good, Before you do that, may I
have number, miss ,,,

45
00:05:55,939 --> 00:05:58,939
T,J,
Ms, Hanson sounds so out,

46
00:05:59,483 --> 00:06:02,817
You do not give
fake phone?

47
00:06:02,946 --> 00:06:08,237
If so, can you my real
get tonight at The Mill,

48
00:06:08,826 --> 00:06:13,737
Karaoke Friday, We see each other there,
- Okay, that's fine,

49
00:06:38,606 --> 00:06:43,483
How are you?
How was the shoot?

50
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:46,855
Pay more than the technical
college, How did it go for you?

51
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:50,822
Only a shovel in my crotch,
- Progress,

52
00:07:03,173 --> 00:07:10,053
You have exactly three minutes,
I have an important meeting,

53
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:15,007
Of course, Mr, Millan ,,,
- No no no,

54
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:18,637
It is Professor Millan,

55
00:07:18,771 --> 00:07:24,358
I have not been to six universities
studied to be called Mr, Millan,

56
00:07:26,487 --> 00:07:31,149
Professor Millan, we think
we more working formulas have-

57
00:07:31,285 --> 00:07:38,449
which can be thought
predict and influence them,

58
00:07:40,918 --> 00:07:47,288
Mind Control?
- The term has a bad name ,,, yes,

59
00:07:50,052 --> 00:07:53,387
Mind Control?
- Yes,

60
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:56,880
This is not only
a dead end,

61
00:07:57,019 --> 00:08:01,810
But I expect one more realistic
project of my students,

62
00:08:01,939 --> 00:08:08,228
We have only a little more
equipment necessary for research,

63
00:08:08,362 --> 00:08:12,490
We wondered, or hoped,

64
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:18,367
To give us a recommendation for
a scholarship could give,

65
00:08:18,497 --> 00:08:22,447
$ 10,000?
- To start with,

66
00:08:22,877 --> 00:08:25,547
$ 10,000?

67
00:08:25,713 --> 00:08:30,209
Yes sir,
We wrote a proposal,

68
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:33,677
We typing it out,

69
00:08:33,804 --> 00:08:37,221
This is our ,,,
- This copy is for you,

70
00:08:37,975 --> 00:08:41,844
A preliminary copy,
- I should have typing,

71
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:48,856
Gentlemen,
I'm here to help you,

72
00:08:49,403 --> 00:08:53,354
I want to help as much as possible,

73
00:08:53,491 --> 00:08:56,611
But I can such projects
not finance,

74
00:08:57,078 --> 00:09:03,793
You sit in the top 10%, There
you would benefit from them,

75
00:09:04,126 --> 00:09:09,667
But we need your approval
needed to get started,

76
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:17,048
When the next budget round
could think of us?

77
00:09:17,182 --> 00:09:21,096
Then we talk it down,
- Good idea, I could do that,

78
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:28,357
But I'm too busy
for childish experimentation,

79
00:09:28,818 --> 00:09:34,489
Is it a ,,, maybe ,,,
- No,

80
00:09:34,615 --> 00:09:38,399
I have not heard right,
- It is definitely no,

81
00:09:38,745 --> 00:09:42,411
Like you,
- So ,,,

82
00:09:43,709 --> 00:09:47,042
Like you,
- See if we have forgotten nothing,

83
00:09:47,171 --> 00:09:48,913
A nice day,

84
00:09:52,551 --> 00:09:58,303
That could have been better,
- I met my dream girl,

85
00:09:58,432 --> 00:10:03,140
Good for you,
I am very happy for you,

86
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:08,062
I recognize that tone of yours,
- What makes it so obvious?

87
00:10:08,192 --> 00:10:12,937
How's Amy?
- Good, It goes well with us,

88
00:10:13,113 --> 00:10:17,158
We can have a very good bunch
be, very soon,

89
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:20,119
We have great fun together,
- Awesome,

90
00:10:20,245 --> 00:10:27,659
And then she's going out with someone, and I
hear from her friends,

91
00:10:28,836 --> 00:10:30,830
That's not easy,

92
00:10:30,963 --> 00:10:38,259
I miss you very easily with a
girl was laughing, watching a movie,

93
00:10:38,388 --> 00:10:42,255
Gluten-free ecological
Share rice cakes,

94
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:46,299
That is no longer,
- No, And you wanna know why?

95
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:51,769
News:The '60s are over,
It is not that way anymore,

96
00:10:51,902 --> 00:10:54,772
It is not so,
You know what would go?

97
00:10:54,904 --> 00:11:01,109
And what to do now? Fuck,
That may sound wrong,

98
00:11:01,245 --> 00:11:05,573
Girls fuck until you find one
which is not as crazy as the rest,

99
00:11:05,706 --> 00:11:09,751
You know, you are wrong,
I feel sorry for you,

100
00:11:09,878 --> 00:11:12,914
I'm not wrong,
and I feel sorry for you,

101
00:11:13,048 --> 00:11:16,131
I want that big moment,

102
00:11:16,259 --> 00:11:22,594
We meet on the street
rain and kissing unabashedly,

103
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:28,475
That's my wish list,
- That you have to throw away,

104
00:11:28,605 --> 00:11:32,732
Throw away your wishlist,
That is shameful,

105
00:11:34,152 --> 00:11:38,280
You're already now how long behind it
girl ,,, a year?

106
00:11:38,407 --> 00:11:42,321
More than one year,
- How long do you keep that up?

107
00:11:42,451 --> 00:11:47,327
I have calculated, She is literally
65% of my perfect mate,

108
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,369
We both love
Quantum Leap,

109
00:11:52,462 --> 00:11:57,966
That's ,,, As far as I'm with her,
I have to give it a chance,

110
00:12:05,517 --> 00:12:08,636
Do you understand the cooking system
Sitzmans for class?

111
00:12:08,769 --> 00:12:12,519
Thermal fluids
are a complete mystery,

112
00:12:12,649 --> 00:12:15,734
I do not understand,
- I only know the words,

113
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:19,561
Guys, how are you?
They say nowadays,

114
00:12:19,697 --> 00:12:22,652
Why are not you at work?

115
00:12:22,783 --> 00:12:27,908
I wanted to say
you guys look sexy today,

116
00:12:28,039 --> 00:12:33,543
Great combination, Which
jeans is good, Graham,

117
00:12:33,669 --> 00:12:36,244
Lee, what's going on?

118
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:43,510
Honestly, Okay, Sam Beckett
has escaped from his cage,

119
00:12:45,557 --> 00:12:52,769
I have a vague
and general idea where he is,

120
00:12:53,356 --> 00:12:57,105
You hear African rattlesnake
crawling around in our apartment?

121
00:12:57,235 --> 00:13:01,102
Technically speaking?
- No, given exactly,

122
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:06,150
The answer to both is yes,
He can be there,

123
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:13,083
I'm 99 ,,, 84, 85 percent sure
that he is not in the kitchen,

124
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:16,293
But you know
how I am with technique,

125
00:13:16,421 --> 00:13:20,548
I want to meter hose not around
feel crawl tonight,

126
00:13:20,676 --> 00:13:25,883
You said 'meter hose,
I thought as a gay,

127
00:13:26,014 --> 00:13:32,727
I mean it when I say that I do for you
save your eyes and make blind,

128
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:39,730
Guys, we go to the city and
you treat yourself to a drink,

129
00:13:40,736 --> 00:13:45,067
And we forget
this whole event,

130
00:14:05,761 --> 00:14:10,139
Sorry we're late, T-Sizzle
had to get sand out of his taco,

131
00:14:10,267 --> 00:14:17,063
I have a project for Andersons
done, and now I'm ready,

132
00:14:17,149 --> 00:14:20,433
What kind of project?
Making love with a boy?

133
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:27,316
That's never homework,
sex with the boys,

134
00:14:28,326 --> 00:14:35,621
We can relax tonight?
Girls score? Do you see that one?

135
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:41,337
Are you the party and
bachelor life never was?

136
00:14:42,423 --> 00:14:45,424
No!
- Never, Why do you ask that?

137
00:14:45,969 --> 00:14:50,879
Daryl, you're 37,
you are not too old for this life?

138
00:14:51,225 --> 00:14:53,894
Go ahead,

139
00:14:54,019 --> 00:15:00,307
First, I'm 39 and,
second, never in my life,

140
00:15:00,442 --> 00:15:04,522
No one can pin down,
- Pound for pound,

141
00:15:04,654 --> 00:15:09,861
And if you are girls kings
you are not even princes,

142
00:15:09,993 --> 00:15:14,489
You are now more than a year
in that zone friendship with Amy?

143
00:15:14,623 --> 00:15:20,293
I do not like that, We have
all problems with girls,

144
00:15:20,837 --> 00:15:24,966
Rachel and I have half a year
ago broke,

145
00:15:25,091 --> 00:15:31,095
I inherited her hose and the whole
time herrinnerd her face,

146
00:15:31,889 --> 00:15:35,970
And her skin,
And her hugs,

147
00:15:36,102 --> 00:15:39,970
They are so warm,

148
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:45,067
It's so ,,, present,
You have a voice like an angel,

149
00:15:45,988 --> 00:15:51,195
I saw Derek a birthmark
has on its left hand,

150
00:15:51,326 --> 00:15:54,990
Mr, substitute, How are you?
- And you, professor?

151
00:15:55,121 --> 00:15:58,455
You deserve a drink after a long
day with Gabe Willis,

152
00:15:58,584 --> 00:16:02,581
There is more needed,
- We forget Gabe Willis,

153
00:16:03,254 --> 00:16:09,293
Ladies and germs,
for the fourteenth week

154
00:16:09,427 --> 00:16:15,264
sing the 'Three Wise Men'
"Crimson and Clover",

155
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:19,893
Everything good? I'm Dirty D!
- Everything okay?

156
00:16:20,313 --> 00:16:24,311
He's a friend, Do not worry,
- I did not say anything,

157
00:16:24,902 --> 00:16:28,020
You give me that look
- That look?

158
00:16:28,154 --> 00:16:30,692
That look,
- What look?

159
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:35,366
Such "I loathe you
and you find a slet'-look,

160
00:16:36,163 --> 00:16:41,667
That look,
- Does this look better?

161
00:16:41,793 --> 00:16:46,254
Amy, is this look better?
- That is none better,

162
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:48,754
That felt good,
- You're so immature,

163
00:16:48,884 --> 00:16:54,755
You're immature,
- You talk to a lot of girls,

164
00:16:55,514 --> 00:17:03,061
Listen, We can not assume
and having fun?

165
00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:06,356
Say that again,
- Can we have fun?

166
00:17:06,484 --> 00:17:10,778
Say it with a different accent,
- Can we have fun?

167
00:17:12,782 --> 00:17:14,655
Good kiss,
- Shut up,

168
00:17:14,992 --> 00:17:18,612
You should keep your mouth shut,
- You gotta keep your mouth shut, Bitch,

169
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:26,163
Come now, T, J!
- Another few minutes,

170
00:17:26,296 --> 00:17:29,830
Owning an Indian
restaurant is on my wish list,

171
00:17:30,008 --> 00:17:33,174
Is that on your wish list?
- I'll show you,

172
00:17:33,302 --> 00:17:36,921
I have my wishlist always with me,

173
00:17:38,642 --> 00:17:42,390
Not really,
- That's crazy,

174
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:47,313
This is very crazy,
- What's on yours?

175
00:17:47,858 --> 00:17:53,731
Are extra, I want a movie
figure, In a disaster,

176
00:17:53,865 --> 00:17:58,028
I want to be as a person
which runs for his life,

177
00:17:58,161 --> 00:18:01,826
That, or in a film
with Jason Statham,

178
00:18:01,957 --> 00:18:05,124
And a disaster
with Jason Statham?

179
00:18:05,251 --> 00:18:08,621
A dream that becomes real,

180
00:18:08,755 --> 00:18:11,839
Professional golf tournament?
- I played golf at school,

181
00:18:11,967 --> 00:18:16,047
A dream to play professionally,
- I've never waved,

182
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:21,055
Have not you ever played golf?
- T, J,, come, We go now,

183
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:25,979
Another few minutes,

184
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:31,645
No, I do it in my pants
if I do not see Derek, I'm going now,

185
00:18:33,947 --> 00:18:36,403
She is ,,,

186
00:18:36,532 --> 00:18:41,528
Want another shot?
- Yes please,

187
00:18:53,174 --> 00:18:55,547
This is better than Christmas,

188
00:18:55,927 --> 00:18:59,675
Can I touch it?
- Do not touch the buttons,

189
00:19:00,307 --> 00:19:03,391
I do as I want,
- That they he told me,

190
00:19:03,519 --> 00:19:07,385
We are in love,
Everybody, we're in love,

191
00:19:07,522 --> 00:19:09,810
We are not in love,
- When we first met ,,,

192
00:19:15,655 --> 00:19:17,150
You, T, J,

193
00:19:18,032 --> 00:19:23,619
We would ,,,
tomorrow to go play golf,

194
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:29,076
I do not have time,
To prepare lessons,

195
00:19:29,211 --> 00:19:36,008
Look,
T,J, learn ,,,

196
00:19:36,759 --> 00:19:40,971
You must sooner or later things
by stripes, right?

197
00:19:41,932 --> 00:19:46,393
Can you tomorrow? Yes?

198
00:19:51,567 --> 00:19:54,651
Good Evening,
- Good Evening,

199
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:03,441
I've seen that,
It was ,,, fore!

200
00:20:16,592 --> 00:20:20,210
Hi, How are you?
- Good, You've come,

201
00:20:21,012 --> 00:20:24,132
Would I do?
- Yes,

202
00:20:24,266 --> 00:20:27,848
Shall we?
- Yeah, let's go play golf,

203
00:20:31,647 --> 00:20:33,973
How very good you are,

204
00:20:36,778 --> 00:20:41,653
I'm kidding,
- I should hope,

205
00:20:49,165 --> 00:20:56,876
You have to hit it in the water,
Therefore more here,

206
00:21:39,967 --> 00:21:43,915
Graham, how are these
fantastic morning with you?

207
00:21:44,054 --> 00:21:49,594
Not as good as you,
- No? What is going on?

208
00:21:49,684 --> 00:21:55,686
I spent $ 250 yesterday,
- $ 250 on drinks?

209
00:21:55,816 --> 00:21:58,651
No, On taxis

210
00:21:59,111 --> 00:22:03,903
Amy went with me, She was a
little drunk, No problem,

211
00:22:04,031 --> 00:22:07,900
She talked about NSync and stuff,
Boybands interest me anything,

212
00:22:08,036 --> 00:22:12,578
They are bigger than One
Direction, The future is uncertain,

213
00:22:12,708 --> 00:22:18,711
Is she angry, Take a taxi to
home, I'm going after her,

214
00:22:18,838 --> 00:22:23,584
Come back here, Arguing
about the same, five, six times,

215
00:22:23,719 --> 00:22:26,803
Goodness,
- They must be mature,

216
00:22:26,930 --> 00:22:33,384
As a consolation:T,J, and I had
another great night,

217
00:22:33,519 --> 00:22:38,727
You and the teacher, You see each other
billions of times this month,

218
00:22:38,858 --> 00:22:40,482
30 billion and once,

219
00:22:40,611 --> 00:22:45,438
If you do not play golf, you're going
the film or antiquarian,

220
00:22:45,574 --> 00:22:52,822
I see sides of you I never
seen, You playboy, Go away,

221
00:22:52,955 --> 00:22:56,871
Stop, Continue,
- All right, go ahead,

222
00:22:57,251 --> 00:23:01,380
Did not know we had milk,
- You must be dehydrated,

223
00:23:01,507 --> 00:23:07,378
Is that almond milk?
- Lee? What are you doing?

224
00:23:20,858 --> 00:23:27,395
Lee! What are you doing?
- I create a snake-friendly environment,

225
00:23:27,531 --> 00:23:32,527
And if I play Jason Mraz,
then the right,

226
00:23:32,663 --> 00:23:37,075
Snakes love Jason Mraz,
- Time for me to go,

227
00:23:46,343 --> 00:23:48,050
Lots of fun,

228
00:23:48,761 --> 00:23:55,844
Thanks again for the food,
- I find it to be fine with you,

229
00:23:57,604 --> 00:24:02,230
You know, we do this for a while now,

230
00:24:02,358 --> 00:24:07,898
And I thought ,,,
You do know that ,,,

231
00:24:10,826 --> 00:24:16,329
Maybe we can officially ,,,
- Listen, Quinn,

232
00:24:19,209 --> 00:24:23,917
Okay, I do not want you
give the wrong impression,

233
00:24:24,006 --> 00:24:30,210
I like to go with you
and I'm glad I met you,

234
00:24:30,345 --> 00:24:34,674
But I am at the moment
not looking for anything serious,

235
00:24:35,017 --> 00:24:39,559
I am now in the friend zone?

236
00:24:39,645 --> 00:24:45,434
This is not the right time,
- It's a terrible time,

237
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:49,019
You are a giant guy,
- You're a fine fellow,

238
00:24:49,155 --> 00:24:54,067
I see you as a good friend,
- Yes, friend,

239
00:24:54,202 --> 00:25:02,078
It's not the right time,
- You know, I think you're cute,

240
00:25:02,211 --> 00:25:07,632
It should not feel uncomfortable,
- I do not have feelings at all,

241
00:25:08,508 --> 00:25:13,051
You know, So ,,,
- I'm sorry I encouraged you,

242
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:18,767
No no no,
Do not be silly,

243
00:25:18,894 --> 00:25:22,558
Do not be silly, Do not,

244
00:25:23,065 --> 00:25:30,395
You decide how to proceed,
- It's okay,

245
00:25:30,530 --> 00:25:34,314
I'm cool, you're cool,
We are cool,

246
00:25:34,451 --> 00:25:41,747
Great, but now I have to
off, Thanks for the food,

247
00:25:41,875 --> 00:25:46,537
Thank you, Hug,

248
00:25:50,592 --> 00:25:52,170
Shit,

249
00:25:53,427 --> 00:25:58,055
Hello Friend,
I saw what happened,

250
00:25:58,182 --> 00:25:59,760
I sat in the bushes,

251
00:25:59,893 --> 00:26:04,354
I just want to say
what you mean to me,

252
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:09,476
As I stood there,
I googled how to comfort a friend,

253
00:26:09,611 --> 00:26:14,238
And the first thing you say is:
"I am your friend,"

254
00:26:14,365 --> 00:26:18,613
And the second?
- The second is ,,,

255
00:26:19,078 --> 00:26:24,665
"I'm always ready for you,"
And then:"You are not alone,"

256
00:26:24,792 --> 00:26:29,788
You do not want her, She has narrow
hips, Not good to give birth,

257
00:26:29,923 --> 00:26:34,419
You want one with wide hips,
Then they shoot out,

258
00:26:34,802 --> 00:26:37,211
You have a good physique,

259
00:26:46,147 --> 00:26:50,525
Now we have done it,
and it was great,

260
00:26:50,652 --> 00:26:55,194
When I think of people
who do-

261
00:26:55,324 --> 00:26:59,902
they are usually more than that,
if you know what I mean,

262
00:27:00,037 --> 00:27:02,990
Stop, I would not want to talk about it,

263
00:27:03,123 --> 00:27:06,622
I'm just saying
that we should consider it,

264
00:27:06,751 --> 00:27:11,663
Therefore, we should not see each other
see, I do not be fooled,

265
00:27:11,839 --> 00:27:16,336
And I want our friendship
do not ruin it,

266
00:27:16,470 --> 00:27:21,844
And you means a lot to me,
Therefore, we must consider it,

267
00:27:21,974 --> 00:27:28,309
Can not we just chill?
You know, just chilling out,

268
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:32,769
That's a new adjective
noun for this relationship,

269
00:27:34,904 --> 00:27:37,478
Yes, Walk on road
difficult conversations,

270
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:43,483
It is not a difficult conversation
if you have it every day,

271
00:28:07,729 --> 00:28:12,936
With T,J, and that stupid snake
this is the last thing I want to do now,

272
00:28:13,067 --> 00:28:16,354
This is the correct distraction above,
Ready?

273
00:28:16,488 --> 00:28:22,361
Here we go, The goal is that Lee
gives you a thousand dollars,

274
00:28:22,493 --> 00:28:26,443
Remember that it's not mind control
is, but influence,

275
00:28:26,582 --> 00:28:31,657
You should affect him
he gives you the money,

276
00:28:31,795 --> 00:28:35,959
When we were filming this, we get the
Professor Milan Stock Exchange,

277
00:28:36,090 --> 00:28:38,333
Then we go to work,

278
00:28:39,635 --> 00:28:44,179
Lee! What is it for there, buddy?
- Awesome,

279
00:28:44,307 --> 00:28:50,096
Nice of you to come here,
This we should do more often,

280
00:28:55,152 --> 00:28:58,402
So ,,, okay,

281
00:29:00,990 --> 00:29:05,984
I'm hypnotized or something?
- No,

282
00:29:06,121 --> 00:29:10,367
I was once hypnotized,
That was fantastic,

283
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:17,381
It was hilarious, I thought I
was a dog and had a tail,

284
00:29:18,759 --> 00:29:23,550
Is that the end of the story?
- Yes, Dog and tail,

285
00:29:27,976 --> 00:29:34,263
Lee, can I borrow a thousand dollars?
- No, I do not have a thousand dollars,

286
00:29:35,483 --> 00:29:38,934
And your parents?
- I'm now between jobs,

287
00:29:39,070 --> 00:29:44,575
And women, You would give me a
tussenman call,

288
00:29:44,910 --> 00:29:51,576
Are you therefore come? Around me
thousand dollars to extort?

289
00:29:52,166 --> 00:29:55,915
We call Lee ,,,
- I get a thousand dollars or not?

290
00:29:56,255 --> 00:29:59,421
No, I have no money,
and my father either,

291
00:29:59,548 --> 00:30:03,760
He may earn 12,500 with
bottling its own water,

292
00:30:03,886 --> 00:30:07,719
He distributes it,
The hot tap,

293
00:30:13,605 --> 00:30:21,316
Lee, would you help me? We are
friends and I need your help,

294
00:30:21,989 --> 00:30:26,780
You're the only one I can
questions, Can you help me?

295
00:30:26,868 --> 00:30:33,369
I can not say which, and
pay you back as soon as possible,

296
00:30:34,710 --> 00:30:38,837
No, I'm sorry, but
I do not have a thousand dollars,

297
00:30:41,549 --> 00:30:46,175
Listen, if it's any consolation,

298
00:30:46,888 --> 00:30:53,721
I would have made love with you,
You said it, and I enjoyed ,,,,

299
00:30:53,854 --> 00:31:00,734
I saw the two of us together,
- We call Trent,

300
00:31:01,361 --> 00:31:08,608
I do not quite see naked,
But you should do so,

301
00:31:09,036 --> 00:31:15,240
Test this nonsense on a girl,
That is guaranteed,

302
00:31:15,750 --> 00:31:20,460
Then we go to work,
- Find that snake, okay?

303
00:31:20,588 --> 00:31:26,592
I do not like this rejection,
Go with someone,

304
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:30,384
I should've kissed you,
On the mouth,

305
00:31:39,106 --> 00:31:40,898
What?
- Nothing,

306
00:31:42,109 --> 00:31:46,855
He sounded so convincing,
'I want to make love to you',

307
00:31:48,575 --> 00:31:53,451
Was he serious?
- He'd kiss you on the mouth,

308
00:31:54,288 --> 00:32:00,458
Does he really want me here with women
go seduce? I'm mature,

309
00:32:00,586 --> 00:32:04,204
This is technique,

310
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:08,505
We do not use math
formula to pick up women,

311
00:32:08,636 --> 00:32:14,924
We use it to T,J, and Amy
love let us be,

312
00:32:15,059 --> 00:32:21,596
That is too crazy for words,
Crass, Too much fun,

313
00:32:21,732 --> 00:32:23,855
Very nice,

314
00:32:37,458 --> 00:32:41,454
I find it wonderful to have fun,
- Really?

315
00:32:43,755 --> 00:32:48,750
My evening is not perfect
if I do not get your number,

316
00:32:51,888 --> 00:32:56,218
If I may get ,,,

317
00:32:56,351 --> 00:32:58,722
Absolutely,

318
00:33:06,944 --> 00:33:09,567
I think I know you,
Or not,

319
00:33:18,207 --> 00:33:21,161
You're totally my type,
- What?

320
00:33:21,292 --> 00:33:25,455
I think I love you,
- What?

321
00:33:25,588 --> 00:33:28,506
You do not know me, creep,

322
00:33:30,093 --> 00:33:33,545
I am ready,
- 7, 4, 6,

323
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:36,681
7, 4, 6,
- 8, 2, 9,

324
00:33:36,807 --> 00:33:39,346
8, 2, 9,
- 7 3,

325
00:33:39,478 --> 00:33:41,269
7, 3,
- 4,

326
00:33:41,395 --> 00:33:43,886
4,
- 6, 4,

327
00:33:44,023 --> 00:33:46,099
7, 9, 4, 5,

328
00:33:48,069 --> 00:33:52,067
Those are 14 digits ,,,
You're not here,

329
00:33:53,032 --> 00:34:00,031
Can I pour something?
I want to have a nice evening,

330
00:34:49,422 --> 00:34:54,001
<I> Only a rose, </ I>
<I> - That's why you should choose me </ i>,

331
00:34:54,135 --> 00:34:57,385
<I> I know all the vice presidents, </ I>

332
00:34:57,514 --> 00:35:01,262
<I> Ignore him, I have a tree house </ i>
<I> I've been working on for 14 years, </ I>

333
00:35:01,643 --> 00:35:06,056
<I> I love Bette Midler, </ I>
<I> - Me too, I do Jazzercise, </ I>

334
00:35:06,398 --> 00:35:11,106
Look, The angle between its head
and shoulder is 60 degrees,

335
00:35:11,235 --> 00:35:14,023
What does it mean?
- Increased interest,

336
00:35:14,155 --> 00:35:18,900
We have to think of questions,
- Hey guys,

337
00:35:19,994 --> 00:35:23,114
That is old, we may issue
look this week?

338
00:35:23,248 --> 00:35:25,916
Yes, I fast forward,
- No,

339
00:35:26,083 --> 00:35:31,623
I want to see if Marissa Steve and Paul
choose, For the study,

340
00:35:31,757 --> 00:35:36,085
Why? Steve is at the end
this episode turned away,

341
00:35:36,427 --> 00:35:42,548
Thanks, That's my melon,
- That I wanted to distribute,

342
00:35:44,728 --> 00:35:46,637
But it's a good episode,

343
00:35:55,280 --> 00:36:00,619
We need to simplify it,
Delete does not mean anything,

344
00:36:00,744 --> 00:36:04,990
Social status, Family history,
Perfume,

345
00:36:05,331 --> 00:36:07,454
Only the most important,

346
00:36:07,793 --> 00:36:12,003
Good news, guys,
- Did you find the snake?

347
00:36:12,130 --> 00:36:17,586
No, he's here somewhere,
But I started for myself,

348
00:36:17,719 --> 00:36:18,916
Cool,

349
00:36:19,054 --> 00:36:25,672
People on celebrities
sell similar chips on eBay?

350
00:36:25,811 --> 00:36:28,052
You know?
- Yes ,,,

351
00:36:28,188 --> 00:36:34,309
In the kitchen looking for food
that looks like celebrities,

352
00:36:34,652 --> 00:36:40,608
Then I can be here all day
search for Sam Beckett,

353
00:36:42,202 --> 00:36:47,659
That still does not succeed,
That's not a job,

354
00:36:47,791 --> 00:36:51,159
That's certainly a job,

355
00:36:53,088 --> 00:36:56,753
What is this?
What have we here?

356
00:36:57,885 --> 00:37:04,764
Sometimes they are hard to find,
Like these,

357
00:37:06,726 --> 00:37:12,231
My goodness, is that Willem Dafoe?
That's him, I think,

358
00:37:12,356 --> 00:37:17,103
25! 30! 75! $ 400!
7 million dollars!

359
00:37:17,237 --> 00:37:20,985
There's the rent,
There is a new car,

360
00:37:33,085 --> 00:37:34,960
We see something overlooked,

361
00:37:39,217 --> 00:37:42,170
Under what circumstances
she looked away?

362
00:37:43,179 --> 00:37:48,684
Yes, she looked at her friend,
she looked at me, Recalibrate I 95%,

363
00:37:49,061 --> 00:37:51,467
That's not it,

364
00:37:58,195 --> 00:38:02,275
No, That's not it,
That's us,

365
00:38:02,657 --> 00:38:07,117
What?
- The opposite risk of errors,

366
00:38:08,246 --> 00:38:12,492
It is not the women,
We are, We are the X-factor,

367
00:38:12,626 --> 00:38:16,753
We must distinguish ourselves
of the other men,

368
00:38:40,987 --> 00:38:46,574
You flirt already two minutes, but
do not drink offered yet,

369
00:38:46,702 --> 00:38:52,490
I do not even know your name,
Why would I flirt with you?

370
00:38:52,583 --> 00:38:57,327
Slow down, prospector,
- My name is Libby,

371
00:38:58,547 --> 00:39:01,797
I'm alright, Begin with
the elements of Euclid,

372
00:39:01,925 --> 00:39:05,673
The principle of Archimedes,
The Cartesian coordinates,

373
00:39:08,472 --> 00:39:10,963
What?
- What are we doing?

374
00:39:11,143 --> 00:39:13,349
We observe,
- Yes,

375
00:39:13,478 --> 00:39:19,516
Look, What is he doing now? Step 1,
- A girl find to take,

376
00:39:19,650 --> 00:39:21,358
No, trust is step one,

377
00:39:21,487 --> 00:39:25,400
Step 2?
- Step 2 is jealousy,

378
00:39:25,532 --> 00:39:29,364
I was just saying,
J-A-L-O-E-S-I-E,

379
00:39:29,494 --> 00:39:33,989
I want to be a heartbreaker,
I play along during the interview,

380
00:39:34,123 --> 00:39:36,365
Oh okay,

381
00:39:36,585 --> 00:39:40,083
That's Foot Doctor,
Loves 80s music,

382
00:39:40,672 --> 00:39:45,963
That's High Heels, Nice girl,
but no sense of humor,

383
00:39:46,887 --> 00:39:51,181
That's Reader, Likes classical
novels, Only drink wine,

384
00:39:51,307 --> 00:39:58,188
I owe them something,
You're number four on my list,

385
00:39:58,565 --> 00:40:03,311
Why does Libby
I offered her a drink?

386
00:40:03,445 --> 00:40:07,858
P measured along the horizontal
perpendicular line from P to Y-axis,

387
00:40:07,990 --> 00:40:12,867
Do not look to the breasts,
Mass to maintain balance,

388
00:40:12,996 --> 00:40:18,072
Stirs in her glass, I'm sitting
the compression ratio?

389
00:40:18,210 --> 00:40:22,835
Hi, I see you staring at me,
Heavens, what a big breasts,

390
00:40:22,965 --> 00:40:25,170
Poor back,

391
00:40:25,342 --> 00:40:29,719
The concept of forbidden fruit,
You want what you can not have,

392
00:40:29,846 --> 00:40:33,891
What is she?
You must be jealous say

393
00:40:34,016 --> 00:40:36,175
She must be happy now,

394
00:40:36,811 --> 00:40:42,766
I do not know if you're serious,
- That's my secret,

395
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:44,775
Look,
- What?

396
00:40:44,902 --> 00:40:48,983
I drew one pilgrim on one napkin,
Look what he has on his head,

397
00:40:49,115 --> 00:40:55,699
He talks to her,
- It is a pilgrim penis hat,

398
00:40:56,164 --> 00:41:02,416
Consider yourself a superstar?
- No, Does a superstar this?

399
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:07,170
Yes,
- Yes, It works,

400
00:41:10,469 --> 00:41:17,351
You did damn,
- Shit, It works,

401
00:41:18,144 --> 00:41:21,429
What works?
- We did it,

402
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:28,894
We have to go,
We need to document this,

403
00:41:29,030 --> 00:41:31,023
Where are you going?

404
00:41:31,365 --> 00:41:36,324
This is a pilgrim penis hat,

405
00:41:36,788 --> 00:41:41,201
It has a buckle and a hat ,,,
- Shut up,

406
00:41:56,224 --> 00:41:59,427
We tell someone?
- Not yet,

407
00:41:59,561 --> 00:42:02,728
No, Not yet,

408
00:42:02,856 --> 00:42:05,891
I'm T,J, call,
- What? No!

409
00:42:06,318 --> 00:42:09,686
We would not tell you, That is
the worst thing you can do,

410
00:42:09,820 --> 00:42:13,273
Why?
- We do not know if it works,

411
00:42:13,407 --> 00:42:18,449
We tested it and it works,
- We tested it once,

412
00:42:18,579 --> 00:42:24,166
Putting the Wright brothers immediately
300 people in a jumbo jet?

413
00:42:25,170 --> 00:42:29,831
I suggest that we first here
a bit of fun to go along stairs,

414
00:42:29,967 --> 00:42:34,711
It is not to decorate,
- You're wrong,

415
00:42:34,846 --> 00:42:39,554
If your chances with T,J, want
screw up, go ahead,

416
00:42:39,684 --> 00:42:43,634
Flush it if you want,
but do not take me,

417
00:42:43,771 --> 00:42:49,311
What do you suggest?
- We will first slow,

418
00:42:49,443 --> 00:42:55,898
Seeing in perspective,
We are young and single,

419
00:42:56,034 --> 00:43:03,032
We just mathematician
minimized uncertainty,

420
00:43:03,166 --> 00:43:07,378
We must first
solve a few things,

421
00:43:07,503 --> 00:43:14,302
Then we can the ladies love
let it be us, Well?

422
00:43:15,679 --> 00:43:22,427
Okay, But once it works, I call T,J,

423
00:43:28,608 --> 00:43:35,144
Because this is ,,, science,
- This is technique,

424
00:43:41,038 --> 00:43:45,414
I want to return this shirt,
- Of course, no problem,

425
00:43:52,465 --> 00:43:54,873
It's too tight,

426
00:43:58,847 --> 00:44:00,472
Okay ,,,

427
00:44:02,768 --> 00:44:05,887
Okay, very beautiful,

428
00:44:06,021 --> 00:44:11,561
You've won the lottery,
You can now pay for that trip,

429
00:44:11,693 --> 00:44:15,561
Amazing, You are a
attractive bunch,

430
00:44:15,905 --> 00:44:20,733
Honestly, you're the
attractive couple ever,

431
00:44:22,161 --> 00:44:29,992
What size you usually wear?
- Extra ,,, extra ,,, extra ,,, large,

432
00:44:33,965 --> 00:44:37,050
Thanks again,
We are very curious,

433
00:44:37,177 --> 00:44:42,847
The pleasure is all mine,
How long have you been dating?

434
00:44:42,932 --> 00:44:45,304
A Tuesday year,

435
00:44:45,434 --> 00:44:50,596
That you stand it so long with him,
I was sitting by him long ago,

436
00:44:51,483 --> 00:44:58,860
And it is only 60% cotton,
I want 100%,

437
00:44:58,989 --> 00:45:00,650
Cotton,

438
00:45:01,117 --> 00:45:05,530
Do you want your money back,
or do you want to exchange for one-

439
00:45:05,664 --> 00:45:09,791
XXXL shirt cotton?

440
00:45:12,713 --> 00:45:17,291
Can I return the money
and decide later?

441
00:45:17,425 --> 00:45:21,257
No problem,
- Put it on my card,

442
00:45:30,396 --> 00:45:36,518
You are incredibly attractive,
Our band is now stronger,

443
00:45:36,652 --> 00:45:42,027
I agree with that, Steve?
- You two should have lunch,

444
00:45:42,159 --> 00:45:45,324
Thank you,
- I'm sorry, friend,

445
00:45:47,539 --> 00:45:50,742
Wait, What is going on?

446
00:45:51,751 --> 00:45:55,831
Caught in time jumps
Dr, Beckett of life to life-

447
00:45:55,922 --> 00:46:02,423
and corrects mistakes, hoping
he jumps back home,

448
00:46:46,222 --> 00:46:49,224
Daniel Craig,

449
00:46:56,358 --> 00:46:59,110
Nothing in this,

450
00:47:01,989 --> 00:47:04,195
Cheers,

451
00:47:06,242 --> 00:47:10,193
This tastes so good that costs flat
more than the entree,

452
00:47:10,329 --> 00:47:14,708
I can only drink water,
- He's an alcoholic,

453
00:47:14,835 --> 00:47:20,753
Not something for a first date,
But I struggle with it now,

454
00:47:21,300 --> 00:47:27,753
It's okay if you get to know me,
- It affects his life,

455
00:47:28,431 --> 00:47:33,769
Here it goes well,
but later he gets a relapse,

456
00:47:34,938 --> 00:47:37,643
I grab your napkin,

457
00:47:39,525 --> 00:47:44,271
Shelly did you kiss?
- I thought she was mine,

458
00:47:44,405 --> 00:47:48,617
She is yours, And she is 70,
- I know,

459
00:47:48,744 --> 00:47:51,744
Cozy, It was cozy,

460
00:47:51,871 --> 00:47:56,083
I go bungee jumping with Crystal,
- Crystal is great,

461
00:47:56,208 --> 00:48:01,583
They parachuted last week,
Unbelievable,

462
00:48:01,715 --> 00:48:07,135
I have this on potato
Anne Hathaway seems sold,

463
00:48:07,804 --> 00:48:12,431
Hello, who's there?
Is that opportunity that calling? Yes!

464
00:48:17,355 --> 00:48:23,358
He eats all of Snickers, And say
then:"I'm late for work,"

465
00:48:24,195 --> 00:48:29,190
Hungry? Why wait until you
fired? Very sad,

466
00:48:30,202 --> 00:48:34,864
He gives the homeless a dollar,
Appears to be the Gerald Ford,

467
00:48:35,289 --> 00:48:38,327
Since in the gutter, Crazy,

468
00:48:49,596 --> 00:48:53,925
Del, Slut, Slut,

469
00:49:01,817 --> 00:49:06,942
What is your educational philosophy
to form young minds?

470
00:49:14,246 --> 00:49:18,112
The mind of a child is beautiful,

471
00:49:18,583 --> 00:49:23,625
Not yet filled with hatred and disgust
where the world is full of them,

472
00:49:23,755 --> 00:49:29,876
But with love and creativity
which we do not have anymore,

473
00:49:30,012 --> 00:49:36,050
We forget our own youth
this guy spirits surrounds,

474
00:49:36,184 --> 00:49:38,889
Who am I
in order to stand in the way?

475
00:49:39,021 --> 00:49:45,307
The question is, is was the
educational philosophy of youth?

476
00:49:46,612 --> 00:49:49,980
Let's
as a starting point,

477
00:49:51,574 --> 00:49:55,239
Interesting,
- Bosh,

478
00:50:03,836 --> 00:50:07,501
What this has with
Charles Dickens to do?

479
00:50:07,757 --> 00:50:10,545
Absolutely everything,

480
00:50:23,356 --> 00:50:27,485
That looks good,
You have a nice shirt,

481
00:50:27,610 --> 00:50:32,188
I love this shirt,
You will like this shirt?

482
00:50:43,168 --> 00:50:46,418
Hello, How is it pink?

483
00:50:46,545 --> 00:50:49,961
Quinn, you want chimichanga?

484
00:50:50,300 --> 00:50:53,420
Hi, You are cute,

485
00:50:53,552 --> 00:50:58,132
And you, Graham? I want tacos,
- Wow,

486
00:50:58,266 --> 00:51:02,726
Watch what you say, I have one here
woman of Mexican descent,

487
00:51:02,853 --> 00:51:09,853
Then order them,
- Sorry, some insensitive,

488
00:51:11,445 --> 00:51:13,521
I could eat her taco,

489
00:52:29,190 --> 00:52:33,141
Harrison, you sly dog,

490
00:52:33,277 --> 00:52:37,856
You are not on the list,
- Do not do that,

491
00:52:37,990 --> 00:52:43,530
I'm kidding,
- Go away, This guy,

492
00:52:43,664 --> 00:52:48,871
Quinn, you look giant sexy,
- I feel sexy tonight,

493
00:52:49,001 --> 00:52:50,829
Give me two, Boom,

494
00:52:50,963 --> 00:52:55,173
What have we here?
A romance in the stairwell?

495
00:52:55,300 --> 00:53:01,552
Is that Chris Denclaw?
- Get lost,

496
00:53:01,681 --> 00:53:06,923
Are you ready?
- Everyone from the clothes,

497
00:53:17,530 --> 00:53:20,282
Everyone from the clothes,

498
00:53:20,409 --> 00:53:25,449
Robbie, how are you?
- Graham, glad you're here,

499
00:53:25,581 --> 00:53:31,286
Got my shirt now?

00:53:31,420 --> 00:53:36,295
Have fun, boys, There is plenty
food and enough women,

501
00:53:36,425 --> 00:53:39,675
Daryl, All right, buddy?

502
00:53:43,389 --> 00:53:47,518
Does anyone want a hot dog?
- I want a hot dog,

503
00:54:00,032 --> 00:54:05,405
That was a good joke,
- Have you ever played poker with them?

504
00:54:05,536 --> 00:54:10,413
What are we talking about?
- Yes, Amy, Jessica, Megan,

505
00:54:11,835 --> 00:54:14,918
Come, take a picture,

506

The Constantinian dynasty,
- Everytime,

507
00:54:46,452 --> 00:54:51,614
You, me, this bottle, trio,

00:54:53,168 --> 00:54:56,204
Where are we going?
I do not even ,,,

Good for you,

No idea, Go with her lunch,
Sushi, And they must pay,

515
00:55:41,967 --> 00:55:47,126
You do not pay her,
- I'm doing her a favor,

516
00:55:47,264 --> 00:55:52,009
I worry that she's in love with me,
Love you, honey,

517
00:56:01,027 --> 00:56:06,269
Sorry, can you one of them?
- This one?

518
00:56:07,117 --> 00:56:11,244
You're not going to drink alone?
Want some company?

519
00:56:11,371 --> 00:56:14,786
My husband is a little sick,

520
00:56:14,916 --> 00:56:20,871
No, this is wrong, I'm not going ,,,
Sorry,

521

Wait a second,
- Have a nice day, Sorry,

00:56:27,804 --> 00:56:32,181
Can I get your number?
I do not know your name, but ,,,

00:56:44,237 --> 00:56:48,567
I miss the old,
- Really? Well, I do not,

526
00:56:48,659 --> 00:56:52,407
It's been a while,
How are you?

527
00:56:52,538 --> 00:56:57,958
I'm fine,
School, work, you know the drill,

528
00:56:58,085 --> 00:57:03,079
Let's take a bottle of champagne

529
00:57:03,215 --> 00:57:07,213
find something with fire
and to speak the champagne,

530
00:57:07,385 --> 00:57:09,092

00:57:31,867 --> 00:57:36,945
And Cornflakes,
- Should you go to the bathroom?

535
00:57:38,916 --> 00:57:44,670
No idea,
That was weird,

536
00:57:46,132 --> 00:57:53,048
We can home to me
to watch a movie,

537
00:57:54,724 --> 00:57:59,682
I'm busy tonight,
- I have something to fill your evening,

538
00:57:59,813 --> 00:58:05,353
I run two services tonight, and
must write, You know that,

539
00:58:05,485 --> 00:58:07,525
Do you remember?
- Yes,

540
00:58:07,987 --> 00:58:10,822
An essay for English,
- No history,

541
00:58:10,990 --> 00:58:14,489
No, I told you English,

542
00:58:14,619 --> 00:58:19,958
Mr, Popular,
- No, I've been very busy,

543
00:58:20,083 --> 00:58:23,701
What I'm trying to say is ,,,

544
00:58:24,545 --> 00:58:30,251
Dumb phone, Who is calling me now?
Marissa? Shit, it was forgotten,

545
00:58:30,802 --> 00:58:36,177
I have T,J, call, Wait, T,J, is
here, I am not fine,

546
00:58:36,307 --> 00:58:40,684
That spring roll, Tell her how you feel,

547
00:58:41,730 --> 00:58:44,646
What I wanted to say is ,,,

548
00:58:44,775 --> 00:58:47,610
Asshole,

549
00:58:48,027 --> 00:58:51,527
Got a problem?
- Sorry,

550
00:58:51,655 --> 00:58:55,606
Sorry, everyone,

551
00:58:55,744 --> 00:58:58,780
Wait, T,J,
I'll walk you to the car,

552
00:58:58,956 --> 00:59:05,324
My car is parked nearby,
- No, you do not ,,,

553
00:59:05,461 --> 00:59:10,456
Do not work too hard,
Your breasts look great,

554
00:59:11,300 --> 00:59:16,092
Well done, asshole,
- Shut up,

555
00:59:18,599 --> 00:59:21,387
Scott Bakula is so handsome,

556
00:59:21,519 --> 00:59:25,599
He is a national treasure,
You smell nice tonight,

557
00:59:25,731 --> 00:59:29,065
Thank you,
- I like your hair,

558
00:59:29,193 --> 00:59:31,436
I'm tired, just want ,,,

559
00:59:31,572 --> 00:59:34,608
We go to your room
and see who calls the first,

560
00:59:34,740 --> 00:59:38,690
You have to go now,
- I love your breasts wonderful,

561
00:59:39,788 --> 00:59:44,615
I'll see you later,
Scott, what should we do?

562
00:59:54,135 --> 00:59:59,177
I must have missed something,
Something is missing,

563
01:00:00,684 --> 01:00:03,554
What happened to you on?
- The formula contains an error,

564
01:00:03,686 --> 01:00:05,014
What happened?

565
01:00:05,146 --> 01:00:08,811
Amy and I watched Quantum Leap,
I do not know how to say it,

566
01:00:08,942 --> 01:00:12,525
Everything, but everything went wrong,

567
01:00:12,653 --> 01:00:16,652
The same happened to me,
I took T,J, out to dinner,

568
01:00:16,782 --> 01:00:20,117
I cried for an old guy
and her breasts,

569
01:00:20,286 --> 01:00:25,197
You yelled at her breasts?
- We need to fix this,

570
01:00:25,333 --> 01:00:29,829
Before we go to the professor,
- I forgot about that with Milan,

571
01:00:29,963 --> 01:00:34,175
I'm working on a proposal,
- I have to cancel that appointment,

572
01:00:35,342 --> 01:00:36,672
Marissa,

573
01:00:44,686 --> 01:00:47,722
Gentlemen, let me be brief,

574
01:00:47,856 --> 01:00:53,016
In ten minutes, I'm going with my
woman at a True Blood party,

575
01:00:53,570 --> 01:00:58,362
Professor Milan, how are you?
- Good thank you,

576
01:01:01,829 --> 01:01:06,324
Do you believe in the theory of
Love at first sight?

577
01:01:06,458 --> 01:01:08,117
What did you think?

578
01:01:08,251 --> 01:01:15,297
My wife fell in love
when she saw my corpulent body,

579
01:01:15,884 --> 01:01:18,802
Okay, perfect,
- Perfect,

580
01:01:18,929 --> 01:01:22,677
Well, that's no longer theory,

581
01:01:23,224 --> 01:01:29,512
We have a formula
which proves that,

582
01:01:30,690 --> 01:01:35,731
Factors affecting millions
one human interaction,

583
01:01:36,570 --> 01:01:42,775
Her words and clothing,
What they want to hear, What we say,

584
01:01:42,911 --> 01:01:48,451
Two different things,
- Where she is, how she bends,

585
01:01:48,583 --> 01:01:52,829
Every important detail
in this formula,

586
01:01:53,213 --> 01:02:00,460
Use it when you talk,
every woman falls in love with you,

587
01:02:06,268 --> 01:02:08,840
And that's what we have,

588
01:02:08,978 --> 01:02:15,480
I am president of a leading
standing technical College

589
01:02:16,068 --> 01:02:23,068
and you can mind control over
exercise someone?

590
01:02:24,869 --> 01:02:28,036
Okay, Look at this,

591
01:02:28,373 --> 01:02:32,702
Say, I walk to the library
here on campus,

592
01:02:32,835 --> 01:02:38,340
And who is that? A baby,
All alone, How sad,

593
01:02:38,467 --> 01:02:45,844
I go to her and make sure
I'm her dream choice,

594
01:02:46,849 --> 01:02:53,387
And she wants nothing but a
have relationship with me,

595
01:02:53,773 --> 01:02:57,936
The only way,
I feel safe and secure,

596
01:02:58,070 --> 01:03:00,275
I am a supplier,

597
01:03:00,405 --> 01:03:04,320
And that's all,
Do not tell me you felt nothing,

598
01:03:05,661 --> 01:03:11,746
I considered jumping out the window
when I heard the drivel,

599
01:03:11,875 --> 01:03:17,664
I think he does not understand us,
- We say smart things,

600
01:03:18,090 --> 01:03:22,632
I take it back,
- Rewind,

601
01:03:22,760 --> 01:03:29,807
I think you can not understand
how successful we are,

602
01:03:29,934 --> 01:03:36,139
Dozens? Hundreds of women
This method recent weeks,

603
01:03:36,315 --> 01:03:39,684
Are you tired? I'm tired, I take
my vitamin tablets, but ,,,

604
01:03:39,820 --> 01:03:44,731
We have sex very often,
- I understand you not,

605
01:03:45,117 --> 01:03:51,403
You come here and talk about
decorating girls,

606
01:03:52,248 --> 01:03:58,750
You are chauvinistic,
onverantwoordelijke-

607
01:03:58,880 --> 01:04:05,463
despicable, deplorable,
selfish, zielige-

608
01:04:05,762 --> 01:04:09,380
talent wasteful,
potentieverspillende-

609
01:04:09,516 --> 01:04:14,344
huge idiots, The largest ever
studied here,

610
01:04:16,356 --> 01:04:19,143
Thank you,
- You're welcome,

611
01:04:19,275 --> 01:04:23,438
Rebecca, do me a favor and make
sure it idioten-

612
01:04:23,572 --> 01:04:28,648
prohibited from ever being my
office visit,

613
01:04:28,784 --> 01:04:32,617
Thank you,
- Why are you such an asshole?

614
01:04:32,748 --> 01:04:36,496
What did you call me?

615
01:04:36,626 --> 01:04:40,077
John, is everything okay?
- Watch and weep,

616
01:04:40,422 --> 01:04:44,467
Hi, come on in, No, come on in,

617
01:04:44,592 --> 01:04:47,961
We close the door,
so you can not escape,

618
01:04:48,096 --> 01:04:54,384
Graham made a compliment,
without exaggeration,

619
01:04:54,519 --> 01:04:59,809
The reliability index of 95%
and the volume that will be expressed ,,,

620
01:04:59,940 --> 01:05:06,144
,,, By variable X,
- Where are you going tonight?

621
01:05:06,489 --> 01:05:09,655
I am married,
- What? I do not care,

622
01:05:09,784 --> 01:05:13,829
I'm coming, sweetheart, But I have a few
idiots to get rid of,

623
01:05:13,954 --> 01:05:18,250
Let me on a more intimate
illustrate manner,

624
01:05:20,211 --> 01:05:26,713
But that's my wife,
- We turn the wedding ring,

625
01:05:30,179 --> 01:05:34,260
You two weeks against
the decision before go-

626
01:05:34,393 --> 01:05:40,016
and may your side of the case to
bring forward before,

627
01:05:40,565 --> 01:05:43,851
Shit,
- It could have been better,

628
01:05:44,652 --> 01:05:49,563
I'm too drunk
to think about this,

629
01:05:49,699 --> 01:05:55,286
I'm exhausted, I'm going home,
- I stay a while,

630
01:05:55,414 --> 01:06:01,416
I'm going to destroy the barmaid,
- Success, We see each other at home,

631
01:06:03,630 --> 01:06:07,461
I come here to have fun,

632
01:06:24,860 --> 01:06:29,771
I heard you had a fine
last night,

633
01:06:31,782 --> 01:06:36,528
Unbelievable that you barmaid
decorated, Cool,

634
01:06:51,969 --> 01:06:55,838
Why Amy just left the apartment?

635
01:06:57,684 --> 01:07:02,726
When was the last time you
talked? Two weeks ago?

636
01:07:02,856 --> 01:07:06,900
Really,
- We went out, had fun

637
01:07:06,985 --> 01:07:13,237
No problem,
- No problem, A little one,

638
01:07:13,365 --> 01:07:19,820
Are you listening to yourself?
You know what you've done?

639
01:07:20,748 --> 01:07:24,960
You're going out with Amy, My 65%
perfect companion Amy,

640
01:07:25,086 --> 01:07:29,463
Amy is the love of my life,
- So what?

641
01:07:29,590 --> 01:07:33,422
Sure, So what,
- Reason,

642
01:07:33,804 --> 01:07:39,806
Do you really want to do this?
- Yes, I love my T-shirt,

643
01:07:39,934 --> 01:07:44,811
You want to see me without T-shirt,
- That would be like,

644
01:07:46,315 --> 01:07:51,606
Goodness, Coward,
I would not do it,

645
01:07:51,780 --> 01:07:57,235
You little girl, No wonder
Amy you do not like,

646
01:07:57,369 --> 01:08:01,615
Would you not air in your lungs
have to live?

647
01:08:01,748 --> 01:08:06,706
Wait a minute,
You're like a baby,

648
01:08:06,836 --> 01:08:13,255
You use a cooking machine,
- You're a girl with a vagina,

649
01:08:13,385 --> 01:08:16,635
A small vagina? You have still
always a hit phone, Why?

650
01:08:16,805 --> 01:08:23,222
Those are cool, Indian in the Cupboard
is your favorite movie,

651
01:08:23,354 --> 01:08:27,850
You look Felicity and eat frootloops,
I've seen you cry,

652
01:08:27,983 --> 01:08:32,645
I think Felicity well, You too,
- No! Only season two,

653
01:08:32,779 --> 01:08:38,948
Want a little reality?
Here then,

654
01:08:39,078 --> 01:08:44,617
My name is Quinn, I like T, J,,
but I'm too chicken to say anything,

655
01:08:51,256 --> 01:08:56,462
Did you learn from your boyfriend?
- You learned that the flickering camp?

656
01:08:56,595 --> 01:09:02,764
You carry on purpose Felicity T-shirts,
- You've got a Sega Game Gear,

657
01:09:02,893 --> 01:09:08,563
She was the love of my life,
- Love? She had nothing against me,

658
01:09:11,025 --> 01:09:13,564
Slang!

659
01:09:41,139 --> 01:09:47,094
Karma comes in the form of arrow and
arc, Never talk to me anymore,

660
01:09:50,064 --> 01:09:54,644
Sam Beckett,
You fickle mistress,

661
01:09:57,447 --> 01:10:00,947
My pants sits between my cheeks,

662
01:10:22,471 --> 01:10:26,304
T,J, Wait,
- Hi, what are you doing here?

663
01:10:26,435 --> 01:10:30,681
I have to tell you something,
- What happened to your foot?

664
01:10:30,814 --> 01:10:36,104
Part of my klotedag,
- Sorry,

665
01:10:36,778 --> 01:10:44,155
I want to talk, I was not myself
as you might have noticed,

666
01:10:44,286 --> 01:10:50,738
I treat people badly, Stable
since a long time in a candy shop,

667
01:10:52,002 --> 01:10:58,122
Why are you telling me that?
- They disappeared when I saw you,

668
01:11:00,010 --> 01:11:04,886
Every time I talk to you,
if only one SEC

669
01:11:05,015 --> 01:11:09,012
that is the best of the day,

670
01:11:12,648 --> 01:11:19,230
Do you know that John Adams and
John Quincy Adams family?

671
01:11:20,488 --> 01:11:26,360
Who is this?
- Quinn ,,, This is my ,,,

672
01:11:27,203 --> 01:11:31,948
Really? He?
- Annoying, Do you want a hug?

673
01:11:32,082 --> 01:11:33,363
No!

674
01:11:43,302 --> 01:11:48,047
So much corduroy,
- Yes, We have to go now,

675
01:11:48,182 --> 01:11:52,644
We'll talk later, okay?
- Take it easy,

676
01:11:53,814 --> 01:11:56,305
Bye, T,J,

677
01:12:00,028 --> 01:12:06,149
Jakkie, I collected coins
and I've seen everything,

678
01:12:08,787 --> 01:12:12,832
I can only ,,, Jakkie,

679
01:12:12,957 --> 01:12:18,199
Quinn! You used the
like a champion,

680
01:12:24,970 --> 01:12:29,298
Let me see you smile,
That was a good one,

681
01:12:29,432 --> 01:12:34,309
Nice picture, Stay in this position,
That's a nice one,

682
01:12:34,438 --> 01:12:38,766
That feels good,
1, 2, Have already taken him, Sorry

683
01:12:38,899 --> 01:12:43,811
This is for the family album,
Ready, What do you think?

684
01:12:43,947 --> 01:12:47,779
We did not even look,
- What?

685
01:12:48,702 --> 01:12:53,695
Is this the best place
for an anniversary album?

686
01:12:53,832 --> 01:12:58,292
What does it matter whether it's here or somewhere
otherwise, It's just a picture,

687
01:12:58,377 --> 01:13:02,328
Watch your words,
- Joe, do not excite yourself,

688
01:13:02,506 --> 01:13:07,335
I know what the problem is,
- He needs a lesson in manners,

689
01:13:07,470 --> 01:13:12,048
I have two fists,
one for each side of your face,

690
01:13:12,184 --> 01:13:15,386
Do not get excited, Joe, Quiet,

691
01:13:15,520 --> 01:13:18,520
What is her name?
- What?

692
01:13:19,481 --> 01:13:23,694
The girl's name
that makes you behave so,

693
01:13:25,988 --> 01:13:30,698
I know what you're trying,
I have not experienced bunch necessary-

694
01:13:30,828 --> 01:13:35,157
coming here and trying my
sense of self-worth to verhogen-

695
01:13:35,289 --> 01:13:40,036
and my relationship with young love
trying to recover,

696
01:13:52,306 --> 01:13:55,390
Mr Lawrence, Mr Lawrence!

697
01:14:00,899 --> 01:14:04,350
Give me that phone,

698
01:14:06,404 --> 01:14:10,734
Jake find me believe I like it,
What should I do?

699
01:14:10,868 --> 01:14:16,739
Is not that tricky, Emily? You know what
you need to do to me?

700
01:14:16,872 --> 01:14:21,783
Assign him now he had some
has dignity,

701
01:14:22,378 --> 01:14:26,921
Will you do that, Emily?
Would you do that for me?

702
01:14:27,050 --> 01:14:31,759
Give a little dignity?
Let him alone, Emily?

703
01:14:31,889 --> 01:14:34,805
Would you do that please?

704
01:14:35,475 --> 01:14:41,679
The lesson today is:Things in
real life that does not exist,

705
01:14:42,815 --> 01:14:46,019
Number one:True love,

706
01:14:46,153 --> 01:14:50,447
Should we write it?
- 'Should we write it? "

707
01:14:50,573 --> 01:14:54,524
Yes, you should write down,
Put your books close,

708
01:14:54,661 --> 01:14:58,956
There will be an exam,
The examination of life,

709
01:14:59,375 --> 01:15:02,541
You will all fail,

710
01:15:05,130 --> 01:15:08,332
You are all corrupt,

711
01:15:12,220 --> 01:15:16,301
And that's what the real hell,

712
01:15:21,270 --> 01:15:26,479
Thank you, Really,
It was a pleasure,

713
01:15:31,198 --> 01:15:36,618
That's the last time I
Craftsman tools use,

714
01:15:37,119 --> 01:15:44,202
That's life, Drink some, Stick your
finger on to the women,

715
01:15:44,586 --> 01:15:49,960
I am glad that we no woman
have, We do what we want,

716
01:15:51,801 --> 01:15:55,751
Look at that guy,
So pathetic there,

717
01:15:55,889 --> 01:16:00,016
I would be his eulogy at his
good days must ven-

718
01:16:00,143 --> 01:16:03,926
for they are gone,
That are dead,

719
01:16:08,694 --> 01:16:13,271
This is so great,
- I want nothing more than this life,

720
01:16:13,364 --> 01:16:17,314
Can you keep your mouth shut,
Please,

721
01:16:18,162 --> 01:16:23,287
Got a problem?
- Do you know how pathetic you sound?

722
01:16:23,833 --> 01:16:26,621
Yes, What?

723
01:16:27,421 --> 01:16:31,086
You believe you are single
because you want to,

724
01:16:31,216 --> 01:16:34,833
Yes,
- The reality is different,

725
01:16:35,345 --> 01:16:38,761
You're single
because you have no choice,

726
01:16:39,181 --> 01:16:46,644
No woman wants to go out with you,
as long as you behave so pathetic,

727
01:16:47,356 --> 01:16:49,184
Wastrel,

728
01:16:50,068 --> 01:16:51,645
For life,

729
01:16:52,319 --> 01:16:57,528
I'm sick,

730
01:17:07,085 --> 01:17:12,162
Sorry, Why am I
everybody cry?

731
01:17:21,390 --> 01:17:26,634
Drive you?
- What you did was not necessary,

732
01:17:27,188 --> 01:17:29,514
Sure, But walk away,

733
01:17:50,045 --> 01:17:55,204
This toast is like
the Christmas album of Kenny G,

734
01:17:55,341 --> 01:17:58,260
$ 1,200,

735
01:17:58,636 --> 01:18:02,255
I am happy for you,
- What happened to you on?

736
01:18:03,641 --> 01:18:09,561
I might have 20 young lives
ruined, my friends hate me-

737
01:18:09,689 --> 01:18:13,189
the love of my life
disappeared, should I go on?

738
01:18:13,275 --> 01:18:16,360
You have to see the positive,
- That's not so simple,

739
01:18:16,488 --> 01:18:23,202
I told her I love her
am, and she rejected me,

740
01:18:23,328 --> 01:18:26,945
You know what? Life goes on,
One girl pointed you,

741
01:18:27,082 --> 01:18:33,286
There are bigger problems in the
world, I'm not comforted,

742
01:18:35,631 --> 01:18:40,293
Do not whine and do not worry
about what you can not influence,

743
01:18:40,386 --> 01:18:46,176
Worry about your example
damaged friendships,

744
01:18:46,601 --> 01:18:51,429
It bothers me that a good guy
like you-

745
01:18:51,564 --> 01:18:57,234
so much time and talent wasted on
such childish things,

746
01:18:59,488 --> 01:19:01,695
Grow up, Quinn,

747
01:19:10,875 --> 01:19:14,956
Thanks, dude,
- You're welcome,

748
01:19:22,136 --> 01:19:25,055
Do not pretend you do not want this,

749
01:19:31,729 --> 01:19:36,273
How are you?
- I did not know you were coming,

750
01:19:36,400 --> 01:19:41,145
Yes,
- Graham, I just wanted to say ,,,

751
01:19:41,489 --> 01:19:46,282
Good Evening, This is exciting,
I can not wait for her,

752
01:19:47,078 --> 01:19:54,125
I've been waiting all week on a
great excuse yours,

753
01:19:54,252 --> 01:20:00,125
We sincerely apologize for ,,,
- I'm sorry, Graham, I mean it,

754
01:20:00,509 --> 01:20:06,012
What are you doing?
- It was foolish to mess with Amy,

755
01:20:06,139 --> 01:20:11,595
You're my best friend, I want our
friendship not put at stake,

756
01:20:12,729 --> 01:20:20,190
Forget that girl, You are a good
guy and deserves better,

757
01:20:22,363 --> 01:20:25,863
Can this not equally bromance
wait?

758
01:20:25,992 --> 01:20:28,613
What about me?
- Give us a few seconds,

759
01:20:28,787 --> 01:20:33,413
Quinn, what are you doing?
- Let's talk like men,

760
01:20:35,752 --> 01:20:39,880
Professor Millan, you will find
that what we do is meaningless,

761
01:20:40,006 --> 01:20:44,418
And that's it,
We've been assholes,

762
01:20:45,386 --> 01:20:50,381
Something I've learned is that no
single book can teach me to ,,,

763
01:20:50,893 --> 01:20:56,313
,,, Let me act like women
a complete idiot,

764
01:20:58,274 --> 01:21:02,225
Damn, I know,

765
01:21:08,159 --> 01:21:10,152
Becky Forrester,

766
01:21:11,747 --> 01:21:13,158
What?

767
01:21:14,166 --> 01:21:19,918
I thought Becky Forrester
was correct, I did that,

768
01:21:20,046 --> 01:21:25,881
But she made it out the day before
my twenty-first birthday,

769
01:21:26,345 --> 01:21:31,220
The next evening
I wanted to be aggressive,

770
01:21:31,682 --> 01:21:36,310
But instead
I met this girl,

771
01:21:36,438 --> 01:21:40,934
And ten months later, she was
Ms, Millan,

772
01:21:42,944 --> 01:21:47,322
Strange things
dissolve that way,

773
01:21:47,448 --> 01:21:52,359
Guys, I understand you,
Really,

774
01:21:53,913 --> 01:21:58,789
But I have already told you:
Women ,,,

775
01:22:00,671 --> 01:22:06,756
are an example of things
men can never understand,

776
01:22:06,885 --> 01:22:08,545
Never,

777
01:22:08,677 --> 01:22:12,378
But nevertheless ,,,
We love it,

778
01:22:13,559 --> 01:22:17,639
Quinn, I should call Amy?
- Who is Amy?

779
01:22:20,940 --> 01:22:25,069
At this time we chill,
as they want to express,

780
01:22:26,445 --> 01:22:30,525
We fought,
- Lusten you raisins?

781
01:22:30,658 --> 01:22:37,408
I love raisins,
- Unfortunately I only have a whole bag,

782
01:22:41,127 --> 01:22:42,871
There you go, Amy,

783
01:22:43,546 --> 01:22:48,042
I need to buy new ones,
- I also have new shoes,

784
01:22:48,510 --> 01:22:52,092
I also have new shoes,
- I live alone,

785
01:22:54,349 --> 01:22:58,761
I put some pillows on the couch,
The whole room is lighter,

786
01:22:59,104 --> 01:23:02,270
Sounds good,
- Keep things together,

787
01:23:02,399 --> 01:23:05,483
Has to do with Feng Shui,
One ,,,

788
01:23:05,609 --> 01:23:09,229
,,, Two ,,, three,

789
01:23:11,699 --> 01:23:17,287
I had not met him yet,
I did not know who he was,

790
01:23:19,875 --> 01:23:24,832
You know ,,, One Direction
does not have a ceiling,

791
01:23:25,005 --> 01:23:29,547
Therefore, they are what they are,
- I did exactly as told,

792
01:23:29,676 --> 01:23:33,590
She was so angry,
she had no words,

793
01:23:33,721 --> 01:23:37,636
The Back Street Boys
can they sit on back seat,

794
01:23:41,854 --> 01:23:45,899
That looks like
a racetrack in Tijuana,

795
01:23:48,904 --> 01:23:51,311
Hi, Quinn,
- How are you?

796
01:23:52,032 --> 01:23:55,400
You know Libby, I believe,

797
01:23:56,328 --> 01:24:01,783
I want to thank you officially it
you showed us how sorry we were,

798
01:24:01,916 --> 01:24:04,489
Until recently,

799
01:24:13,220 --> 01:24:16,386
Oh baby, you're so sweet,

800
01:24:16,515 --> 01:24:21,092
You changed our view
in the entire universe,

801
01:24:22,895 --> 01:24:28,186
I am happy that
you that was recognized,

802
01:24:28,318 --> 01:24:31,153
And so fast,
- You're a gem,

803
01:24:31,279 --> 01:24:35,739
And man among boys,
- Have a nice evening,

804
01:24:35,908 --> 01:24:40,037
Shoot some more arrows, Cupid,

805
01:24:41,914 --> 01:24:44,667
You are annoying,
I'm out of here,

806
01:25:00,475 --> 01:25:02,966
We need to talk, Okay?

807
01:25:03,311 --> 01:25:06,515
Ladies and germs,

808
01:25:06,899 --> 01:25:10,064
We have a newcomer,

809
01:25:10,193 --> 01:25:15,484
Help me this man
karaoke virginity to lose,

810
01:25:15,573 --> 01:25:19,702
Graham Jacobs, Come here,

811
01:25:19,953 --> 01:25:23,322
I think there is nothing
to talk about,

812
01:25:23,457 --> 01:25:24,702
What ,,,

813
01:25:30,963 --> 01:25:33,632
Hello, My name is Graham,

814
01:25:33,759 --> 01:25:38,255
I'm going to sing something
I usually sing alone,

815
01:25:38,387 --> 01:25:42,171
But now I'm going to
sing for everyone,

816
01:25:57,157 --> 01:26:01,903
Just like the time
Derek and I did it,

817
01:26:12,881 --> 01:26:17,045
It makes me so horny,

818
01:26:44,787 --> 01:26:48,157
This song was always
for someone in particular,

819
01:26:48,332 --> 01:26:53,207
But I'm open to suggestions,
Can be for you, you're cute,

820
01:26:54,005 --> 01:27:01,051
I learned a lot about myself,
And I just have to sit there,

821
01:27:34,628 --> 01:27:40,881
Now, a random white man,
who thinks he's funny is-

822
01:27:41,011 --> 01:27:44,594
Tupac sing,

823
01:27:50,311 --> 01:27:53,561
T,J, Hi, It's Quinn,

824
01:27:54,231 --> 01:27:58,729
Come about 20 minutes to the New
Strand Theater, Hope to see you,

825
01:28:13,292 --> 01:28:14,667
Quinn?

826
01:28:17,546 --> 01:28:23,003
It's weird when you call me and me
asks to go to a cinema,

827
01:28:23,136 --> 01:28:27,548
Hello Madam, and welcome
New Strand Theatre,

828
01:28:28,766 --> 01:28:30,046
What is this?

829
01:28:30,185 --> 01:28:34,229
Tonight we turn
the latest film by Jason Statham,

830
01:28:34,355 --> 01:28:38,899
I forgot his name,
but he plays Keith Ramsberg,

831
01:28:39,027 --> 01:28:43,439
There is a knife fight scene,
and he shows his dewooling buttocks,

832
01:28:44,115 --> 01:28:48,195
Quinn, this is great,
but I've already told you ,,,

833
01:28:48,328 --> 01:28:52,372
Sorry to interrupt,

834
01:28:53,958 --> 01:29:00,875
When we practiced, you always said
ball long to get rolling, never short,

835
01:29:01,007 --> 01:29:04,043
Do you remember that?
- Yes,

836
01:29:05,136 --> 01:29:09,845
We can be friends,
and that's great,

837
01:29:09,975 --> 01:29:15,217
But I want you to know
I'm going to try it,

838
01:29:16,023 --> 01:29:21,064
If I do not take the opportunity to
wells, then why do I play?

839
01:29:23,697 --> 01:29:27,065
I'm not asking you to marry me,

840
01:29:27,199 --> 01:29:29,774
Not even to go together,

841
01:29:30,244 --> 01:29:36,579
But I ask you,
you want to see Jason Statham?

842
01:29:39,628 --> 01:29:43,958
You said it at the end
his bare buttocks show?

843
01:29:44,091 --> 01:29:50,510
Yes, He does,
- In this case, it is worth,

844
01:29:52,725 --> 01:29:54,682
Amazing,

845
01:29:58,105 --> 01:30:01,974
Would you like popcorn?
- Please,

846
01:30:03,110 --> 01:30:08,402
This is a terrible movie,
- The worst,

847
01:30:18,542 --> 01:30:20,582
