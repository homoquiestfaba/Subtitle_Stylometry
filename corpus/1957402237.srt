1
00:00:55,597 --> 00:00:57,849
Come out, my child...

2
00:00:58,016 --> 00:01:02,646
Don't fear us. We only want to help you.

3
00:01:03,897 --> 00:01:06,149
Help you ease your pain.

4
00:01:07,985 --> 00:01:11,697
I can smell you. And so can my sister...

5
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:14,950
Child. Please.

6
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:23,458
Hello, my child...

7
00:01:23,584 --> 00:01:27,713
Come out and make us proud... won't you?

8
00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:07,085
You cannot escape him...

9
00:02:10,172 --> 00:02:11,965
It is your fate.

10
00:02:17,054 --> 00:02:21,433
Please... please!

11
00:02:22,392 --> 00:02:24,061
Help me!

12
00:02:24,436 --> 00:02:26,313
Life begins in pain...

13
00:02:26,938 --> 00:02:29,107
Pain is necessary...

14
00:02:32,944 --> 00:02:34,404
He is coming...

15
00:02:35,739 --> 00:02:37,115
Rejoice!

16
00:02:38,659 --> 00:02:40,827
For you are truly blessed!

17
00:03:02,974 --> 00:03:07,938
Please... help me.

18
00:12:05,516 --> 00:12:07,185
Who are you?

19
00:12:07,268 --> 00:12:08,561
What are you doing here?

20
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:58,004
Not by the ears, Amalia. Remember?

21
00:13:58,171 --> 00:13:59,464
Sorry, Papa.

22
00:14:00,048 --> 00:14:01,299
Who are they?

23
00:14:02,717 --> 00:14:04,010
Friends of Karl.

24
00:14:04,135 --> 00:14:06,220
Karl... the one who died?

25
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:46,386
Go fetch our meat.

26
00:17:13,491 --> 00:17:15,701
Good shot, Papa.

27
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:17,328
Well done, my girl.

28
00:27:04,581 --> 00:27:10,379
The eye of the hunter
must always be open...

29
00:27:14,049 --> 00:27:19,012
...looking for opportunity,
looking for danger...

30
00:27:21,098 --> 00:27:23,892
...for prey or predator.

31
00:27:30,732 --> 00:27:33,527
Are you watching closely, Little Bird?

32
00:27:59,845 --> 00:28:01,096
You must eat!

33
00:28:02,472 --> 00:28:03,891
It is our way.

34
00:28:04,308 --> 00:28:05,309
The only way!

35
00:28:08,979 --> 00:28:10,606
Go and help them.

36
00:31:36,103 --> 00:31:38,105
Like little rabbits.

37
00:31:38,563 --> 00:31:41,566
Always like scared, little rabbits.

38
00:31:45,612 --> 00:31:47,614
Barbaric...

39
00:31:48,865 --> 00:31:50,242
and crude.

40
00:31:50,659 --> 00:31:53,078
They deserved more.

41
00:31:58,125 --> 00:32:00,752
The old man is gone.

42
00:32:02,629 --> 00:32:06,591
There is only... these two.

43
00:32:11,012 --> 00:32:12,514
This one...

44
00:32:28,196 --> 00:32:29,781
She is his blood.

45
00:32:30,866 --> 00:32:34,202
A promise fulfilled.

46
00:33:07,861 --> 00:33:09,779
Come now, child.

47
00:33:09,863 --> 00:33:11,865
This is good for you.

48
00:33:33,303 --> 00:33:34,971
Now the male.

49
00:35:07,188 --> 00:35:08,356
The monster.

50
00:35:17,532 --> 00:35:19,951
Papa, where are we?

51
00:36:55,755 --> 00:36:57,173
Do you know this symbol?

52
00:38:45,865 --> 00:38:46,825
My client.

53
00:38:49,953 --> 00:38:51,412
What is this?

54
00:38:51,496 --> 00:38:52,455
What is happening?

55
00:39:14,435 --> 00:39:16,062
The time has come!

56
00:40:45,777 --> 00:40:48,029
The first blood...

57
00:40:48,112 --> 00:40:51,032
...we usher in the new hunt.

58
00:41:18,434 --> 00:41:19,519
It is done.

59
00:41:20,561 --> 00:41:22,313
His time has come.

60
00:41:22,897 --> 00:41:25,316
The three of us welcome him.

61
00:41:25,817 --> 00:41:27,819
The solstice has come.

62
00:41:28,277 --> 00:41:29,946
The hunt has begun.

63
00:41:31,322 --> 00:41:32,824
Bring him to the hut.

64
00:41:44,711 --> 00:41:46,421
What the fucking hell is this?

65
00:41:57,849 --> 00:41:59,225
We are servants.

66
00:41:59,976 --> 00:42:02,103
Servants of the hunter.

67
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:51,142
Unchain his quarry.

68
00:47:11,704 --> 00:47:12,747
Run.

69
00:47:19,045 --> 00:47:20,087
Run! Run!

70
00:47:36,395 --> 00:47:38,022
Run.

71
00:53:42,052 --> 00:53:43,178
You're welcome.

72
00:53:49,685 --> 00:53:50,853
At last!

73
00:56:14,329 --> 00:56:19,293
They used to cut down trees here.

74
01:01:46,536 --> 01:01:48,455
These trees, the forest...

75
01:01:49,122 --> 01:01:51,541
...will remember you.

76
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:55,128
We will make sure of that.

77
01:02:12,187 --> 01:02:15,440
I kept her safe. I helped hide her.

78
01:02:15,523 --> 01:02:18,485
Well done, my girl.

79
01:02:19,194 --> 01:02:21,821
And this!

80
01:04:46,383 --> 01:04:48,593
Stay here! Hide!

81
01:06:41,664 --> 01:06:43,750
The blood of the kills.

82
01:06:44,292 --> 01:06:46,294
We shall consume it to share his power.

83
01:06:46,961 --> 01:06:52,258
And adorn this holy ground
with its essence.

84
01:07:03,186 --> 01:07:04,812
With this blood...

85
01:07:04,979 --> 01:07:10,777
...we consecrate and confirm
our alliance to our lord of the land.

86
01:07:11,569 --> 01:07:14,072
...to the god of the hunt.

87
01:07:14,822 --> 01:07:17,659
...to the master of all nature.

88
01:07:18,952 --> 01:07:20,954
The chapel is blessed.

89
01:07:22,872 --> 01:07:26,209
We ready ourselves to welcome him home.

90
01:07:28,002 --> 01:07:31,506
The feast shall be great this season.

91
01:07:32,549 --> 01:07:35,969
Many wonderful flavors
provided by the lord of providers.

92
01:07:36,886 --> 01:07:38,805
Oh, yes...

93
01:07:39,514 --> 01:07:42,767
We shall be rewarded.

94
01:09:29,582 --> 01:09:31,709
Hunter. Not hunted.

95
01:10:41,195 --> 01:10:42,739
You were...

96
01:10:42,822 --> 01:10:45,533
...his entire world...

97
01:10:46,117 --> 01:10:49,871
and he gave his life...

98
01:10:52,415 --> 01:10:54,083
so that you...

99
01:10:55,376 --> 01:10:57,420
...could survive.

100
01:11:00,381 --> 01:11:02,633
Hunter. Not hunted.

101
01:11:03,217 --> 01:11:04,385
You too.

102
01:11:32,038 --> 01:11:34,332
Remember your faith.

103
01:11:41,005 --> 01:11:44,425
So devout, yet so restless.

104
01:11:44,884 --> 01:11:46,719
You know her...

105
01:11:48,221 --> 01:11:51,265
She should be accustomed...

106
01:11:52,725 --> 01:11:54,685
...after all this time.

107
01:11:56,938 --> 01:11:59,148
That's a matter of perspective.

108
01:12:06,405 --> 01:12:08,908
You think it will end?

109
01:12:09,283 --> 01:12:10,535
What?

110
01:12:11,285 --> 01:12:16,332
This. The world. The land.

111
01:12:16,958 --> 01:12:18,251
Him.

112
01:12:19,669 --> 01:12:22,088
Do you think, one day,
it will all be gone?

113
01:12:22,755 --> 01:12:24,465
As will we?

114
01:12:25,091 --> 01:12:29,470
One day, we will be gone?

115
01:12:30,763 --> 01:12:33,516
Like our sisters before us.

116
01:12:34,600 --> 01:12:37,436
And the ones before them.

117
01:12:38,813 --> 01:12:40,773
But the earth?

118
01:12:40,857 --> 01:12:42,066
Our lord?

119
01:12:42,149 --> 01:12:43,359
No.

120
01:12:45,987 --> 01:12:47,989
He will abide.

121
01:12:48,239 --> 01:12:53,077
And our sisters will oblige him.

122
01:12:55,204 --> 01:12:57,290
Until the end of time?

123
01:12:57,915 --> 01:13:02,420
The thing that has been
is that which shall be...

124
01:13:04,505 --> 01:13:09,135
...and that which is done
is what shall be done.

125
01:13:10,261 --> 01:13:14,098
And the circle shall not be broken.

126
01:13:45,338 --> 01:13:46,714
Death traps.

127
01:13:49,717 --> 01:13:50,968
Shit.

128
01:14:06,192 --> 01:14:07,652
Polaris.

129
01:14:28,756 --> 01:14:30,132
Karl died.

130
01:14:34,887 --> 01:14:36,430
I miss papa.

131
01:15:28,315 --> 01:15:31,569
You let her go, you big asshole!

132
01:16:52,775 --> 01:16:56,570
We three, your devout servants,
sisters of the glen...

133
01:16:57,780 --> 01:17:05,162
...hail your victory and your presence
in this, your holy temple!

134
01:17:06,330 --> 01:17:09,834
Such devotion pleases me.

135
01:17:12,795 --> 01:17:14,046
You!

136
01:17:15,381 --> 01:17:17,258
Fetch me my weapon.

137
01:17:40,573 --> 01:17:42,867
Bring her.

138
01:17:55,963 --> 01:17:57,923
Willful child.

139
01:17:58,632 --> 01:18:00,301
I honor your spirit.

140
01:18:00,926 --> 01:18:02,970
And your survival.

141
01:18:03,721 --> 01:18:07,433
But there can be
but one survivor here tonight.

142
01:18:08,434 --> 01:18:13,314
And this little bird's grandfather...

143
01:18:13,814 --> 01:18:18,485
...ensured it would be her.

144
01:19:31,684 --> 01:19:33,435
Quiet, Grimur.

145
01:19:34,061 --> 01:19:35,646
Reality is cruel.

146
01:19:36,397 --> 01:19:38,607
Pain is necessary.

147
01:19:41,610 --> 01:19:43,612
She was your friend?

148
01:19:43,946 --> 01:19:45,281
Yeah?

149
01:19:49,326 --> 01:19:51,829
She is my friend.

150
01:19:52,329 --> 01:19:54,498
Prepare this one for the feast.

151
01:22:03,836 --> 01:22:05,254
Give me the knife.

152
01:22:53,302 --> 01:22:54,761
My lord...

153
01:22:56,096 --> 01:23:01,059
I birthed you... help me.

154
01:23:04,438 --> 01:23:06,190
I beg of you...

155
01:23:06,857 --> 01:23:10,861
I have been born many times, my servant.

156
01:23:11,528 --> 01:23:14,364
Your reward is your service.

157
01:23:15,282 --> 01:23:19,203
Now die with your dignity.

158
01:23:19,286 --> 01:23:20,746
Please...

159
01:23:20,996 --> 01:23:22,498
Spare me...

160
01:23:24,875 --> 01:23:26,502
I have served you.

161
01:23:26,585 --> 01:23:28,837
I am Cernunnos!

162
01:23:28,921 --> 01:23:30,923
Master of these woods.

163
01:23:31,131 --> 01:23:33,592
Your lord and master.

164
01:23:34,218 --> 01:23:37,721
It is the way of nature
for death to precede new life.

165
01:23:39,765 --> 01:23:42,434
One has come to take your place.

166
01:23:43,268 --> 01:23:46,313
It is your time.

167
01:26:43,156 --> 01:26:45,242
Run! Live!

168
01:27:11,977 --> 01:27:17,107
I'm nobody's servant.

169
01:27:54,186 --> 01:27:56,021
He spared you.

170
01:27:59,316 --> 01:28:01,902
My beauty is gone.

171
01:28:02,819 --> 01:28:04,821
As are my sisters.

172
01:28:06,990 --> 01:28:08,909
But it matters not.

173
01:28:09,367 --> 01:28:11,244
I have more.

174
01:28:12,037 --> 01:28:13,455
Many more.

175
01:28:15,081 --> 01:28:18,376
Everything that ends begins again.

176
01:28:20,086 --> 01:28:23,423
The thing that has been
is that which shall be,

177
01:28:24,257 --> 01:28:28,094
and that which is done is
that which shall be done.

178
01:28:29,596 --> 01:28:32,015
It is the way of nature, no?

179
01:28:32,682 --> 01:28:35,811
What will you do
with the life he has given you?

180
01:28:37,771 --> 01:28:38,897
Live.

181
01:29:27,654 --> 01:29:31,032
Dear God... what happened to her?

182
01:29:31,449 --> 01:29:34,578
She's alive, but weak.

183
01:29:34,953 --> 01:29:36,997
Where could she have come from?

184
01:29:37,080 --> 01:29:40,750
Are you alright? Can you hear me?

185
01:29:44,671 --> 01:29:47,632
What happened to you?

186
01:29:48,383 --> 01:29:50,927
He let me go.

187
01:29:52,137 --> 01:29:55,432
Who? Who let you go?
