1
00:01:04,564 --> 00:01:06,498
- You all right, sir?
- Yes.

2
00:01:08,034 --> 00:01:09,695
So what are you doing here
at 4:00 in the morning?

3
00:01:09,769 --> 00:01:11,361
I'm a cop.

4
00:01:12,172 --> 00:01:15,903
- Got a badge?
- Was a cop, I'm leaving town.

5
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:20,911
I just thought I'd stand here
for a while till I went.

6
00:01:21,881 --> 00:01:23,508
That your car?

7
00:01:24,184 --> 00:01:27,210
-What division you work out of?
-Downtown, Homicide.

8
00:01:27,487 --> 00:01:29,455
- Who runs it?
- Captain Cronjager.

9
00:01:32,859 --> 00:01:34,588
I can smell booze on you.

10
00:01:38,064 --> 00:01:40,157
I'm waiting to sober up.

11
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:44,301
Want me to drive you home in 
your car?My partner can follow us.

12
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:49,833
I'll wait till I'm sober.

13
00:01:52,645 --> 00:01:54,272
Okay.

14
00:03:47,026 --> 00:03:48,118
Where you from?

15
00:03:52,532 --> 00:03:54,227
Where you headed?

16
00:03:58,538 --> 00:04:00,005
Massachusetts.

17
00:04:01,341 --> 00:04:02,831
Massachusetts?

18
00:04:03,509 --> 00:04:05,568
All the way to Massachusetts?

19
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:09,738
You gotta be kidding me, mister.
Massachusetts?

20
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:14,076
<i>Paradise, Massachusetts is 
a long way from home.</i>

21
00:04:15,054 --> 00:04:17,352
But it's been my home for 20 years.

22
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:22,691
In many ways, this town and I
grew up together.

23
00:04:24,697 --> 00:04:28,690
I've appreciated the opportunity
to serve as your police chief

24
00:04:28,768 --> 00:04:32,363
- and I tried never to forget...
- It's a sad day.

25
00:04:32,472 --> 00:04:36,238
...that the trust
you so generously placed in me

26
00:04:37,076 --> 00:04:38,065
had to be earned.

27
00:04:38,745 --> 00:04:39,905
Not once,

28
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:42,338
but every day.

29
00:04:42,649 --> 00:04:45,709
So, as I move on,

30
00:04:48,021 --> 00:04:49,921
I just want to say

31
00:04:51,057 --> 00:04:52,615
thank you.

32
00:04:54,093 --> 00:04:55,492
So...

33
00:04:55,862 --> 00:04:58,330
Before I start crying,
does anyone know a good joke?

34
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:02,532
<i>So, this guy takes 
his old dog to the vet</i>

35
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:05,468
and he says, "Doc, it looks 
like it hurts when he pees. "

36
00:05:05,538 --> 00:05:07,028
Doc says, "How old is he?"

37
00:05:07,106 --> 00:05:11,770
Guy says, "Twelve. "
Doc says, "He's peed enough. "

38
00:05:13,346 --> 00:05:15,371
Not funny, huh?

39
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:45,937
Are you all right?

40
00:05:48,748 --> 00:05:50,409
Going far?

41
00:05:51,084 --> 00:05:52,483
Long way.

42
00:06:05,131 --> 00:06:07,190
I don't see why you feel 
the need to work.

43
00:06:07,266 --> 00:06:10,030
I like it. It gives me 
a sense of independence.

44
00:06:10,436 --> 00:06:12,802
Is that new police chief 
coming this week?

45
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:14,271
Yeah, from California.

46
00:06:15,475 --> 00:06:16,806
That's a long away.

47
00:06:16,976 --> 00:06:18,841
Why is Lou retiring anyway?

48
00:06:19,245 --> 00:06:21,941
He's a relatively young man.

49
00:06:22,815 --> 00:06:24,339
I don't know.
He said he's fed up with the job.

50
00:06:24,417 --> 00:06:25,850
He's put his 20 years in.

51
00:06:27,153 --> 00:06:28,677
Don't you have to be at the bank?

52
00:06:29,088 --> 00:06:30,783
I can go to work when I want.

53
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,025
That'll look good on you.

54
00:06:37,196 --> 00:06:38,254
Why don't you come back to bed?

55
00:06:38,831 --> 00:06:41,231
I can't. I'm going to be late.

56
00:06:41,601 --> 00:06:42,795
Sorry.

57
00:07:11,998 --> 00:07:15,399
I've always wanted to drive 
across country.Take the back roads.

58
00:07:15,868 --> 00:07:17,460
I got nothing better to do.

59
00:07:17,537 --> 00:07:19,437
<i>What if you don't get the job?</i>

60
00:07:21,641 --> 00:07:23,165
<i>Where are you?</i>

61
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:25,968
Missouri, I think.

62
00:07:26,512 --> 00:07:27,877
<i>What's that noise?</i>

63
00:07:28,181 --> 00:07:29,478
I'm in a phone booth.

64
00:07:29,549 --> 00:07:32,245
The phone in my room doesn't work.
It's raining.

65
00:07:32,685 --> 00:07:34,050
<i>You drinking?</i>

66
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,246
Yes.

67
00:07:35,488 --> 00:07:38,048
<i>You need to be 
carefuI of that.</i>

68
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:39,216
I know.

69
00:07:39,992 --> 00:07:41,892
<i>Am I losing you, Jesse?</i>

70
00:07:43,029 --> 00:07:45,429
There's some danger of it, Jenn.

71
00:08:17,563 --> 00:08:19,258
Tequila Sunrise.

72
00:08:22,235 --> 00:08:23,395
Hi.

73
00:08:26,072 --> 00:08:27,334
Hi.

74
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:37,506
You come here often?

75
00:08:37,984 --> 00:08:39,474
What's your sign?

76
00:08:39,819 --> 00:08:41,377
Is there a hidden camera in here?

77
00:08:41,954 --> 00:08:43,854
Gee, I was sure that would work.

78
00:08:44,991 --> 00:08:46,515
My name's Sandy.

79
00:08:46,759 --> 00:08:49,319
- And you are?
- Jesse.

80
00:08:49,829 --> 00:08:52,855
I'm a student here.
I don't figure you for one.

81
00:08:52,965 --> 00:08:54,762
Grad student.

82
00:08:57,003 --> 00:08:59,130
Okay. I'm not in school.

83
00:09:00,106 --> 00:09:03,473
-What do you do for a living,Jesse?
-I'm an insurance adjuster.

84
00:09:03,643 --> 00:09:06,771
So, are you working on a case or 
you have a thing for college girls?

85
00:09:06,846 --> 00:09:08,905
- Both.
- I'm one.

86
00:09:09,081 --> 00:09:12,016
- A case or college girl?
- Both.

87
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,712
And what do you do, Sandy?

88
00:09:15,821 --> 00:09:17,618
I already told you, 
I'm a student.

89
00:09:19,992 --> 00:09:22,017
You're kind of old for me.

90
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:25,998
Everybody says that.

91
00:09:26,933 --> 00:09:28,560
You want to go someplace?

92
00:09:30,303 --> 00:09:32,464
That's a very nice offer, Sandy,

93
00:09:33,706 --> 00:09:35,970
but I'm already going someplace.

94
00:09:38,311 --> 00:09:39,712
I admire your spirit. 
You know, just...

95
00:09:41,347 --> 00:09:45,283
Take all the back roads,
get in the car and just drive.

96
00:09:45,351 --> 00:09:47,114
I mean, I think it's great.

97
00:09:49,522 --> 00:09:50,853
Fifty grand.

98
00:09:50,923 --> 00:09:52,288
Lou.

99
00:09:53,225 --> 00:09:54,658
It's the end of it.

100
00:09:56,529 --> 00:09:58,588
Hasty, is there any other way?

101
00:09:58,664 --> 00:10:01,394
No, there's no other way. Listen, 
I just can't afford you anymore.

102
00:10:02,301 --> 00:10:05,532
- We already picked your replacement so...
- You're just gonna have to pay him.

103
00:10:05,705 --> 00:10:07,832
No, why would I?
The guy's pathetic, he's a loser.

104
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:11,103
He's just looking for a nice quiet place
to hide, and I'm gonna give it to him.

105
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:12,676
Yeah, well, he just might not be
the answer to that...

106
00:10:12,745 --> 00:10:15,077
You know what? It's not your 
problem. Don't worry about it.

107
00:10:15,147 --> 00:10:18,139
Just forget about us, 
forget about this town.

108
00:10:20,486 --> 00:10:21,544
Hey.

109
00:10:25,491 --> 00:10:26,549
Gonna miss you.

110
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:30,062
Go find what's at the end 
of that rainbow, all right?

111
00:11:02,461 --> 00:11:03,985
<i>What time is it there?</i>

112
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:05,820
10:45.

113
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:08,299
<i>It's 7.;45 here.</i>

114
00:11:08,367 --> 00:11:10,460
That would be my guess.

115
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:13,295
<i>-What are you wearing tomorrow?
-I don't know.</i>

116
00:11:13,372 --> 00:11:16,068
<i>Wear your blue suit.
You look so handsome in it.</i>

117
00:11:17,309 --> 00:11:19,539
<i>I wasn't telling you, Jesse.</i>

118
00:11:20,246 --> 00:11:22,646
<i>I'm thinking about 
going into therapy.</i>

119
00:11:22,882 --> 00:11:24,315
Well, do me a favor, Jenn.

120
00:11:24,383 --> 00:11:26,351
If you see a shrink, 
see a real shrink.

121
00:11:26,752 --> 00:11:30,483
Not some idiot who reads your 
aura and does crystal therapy.

122
00:11:30,623 --> 00:11:34,389
<i>I'm just so mixed up about things.
My career, and you, and me...</i>

123
00:11:34,493 --> 00:11:35,892
And Elliott.

124
00:11:36,996 --> 00:11:39,123
<i>I don't want to talk to you
when you're like this!</i>

125
00:11:43,736 --> 00:11:47,103
<i>I made a mistake, but I don't see
why I should be singled out for it.</i>

126
00:11:47,173 --> 00:11:49,573
<i>Everyone's goofed 
off around here.</i>

127
00:11:49,642 --> 00:11:52,509
<i>The Caine's a slack ship.The men 
act like a pack of cutthroats,</i>

128
00:11:52,578 --> 00:11:54,443
<i>the decks look like
 a Singapore junk.</i>

129
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:58,477
<i>I take it, then, that you must 
also strongly disapprove of leave.</i>

130
00:11:58,551 --> 00:12:00,314
<i>Go ahead, Keith, 
man to man.</i>

131
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:02,217
<i>Sir, I'm in no position
to approve or disapprove.</i>

132
00:12:03,089 --> 00:12:06,286
<i>I only know that my conception of
a captain seems different from your own.</i>

133
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:09,519
<i>I'll take it 
under advisement.</i>

134
00:12:09,595 --> 00:12:11,392
<i>Since you feeI so bitter,</i>

135
00:12:11,831 --> 00:12:14,925
<i>perhaps what's in the dispatch
will brighten your day.</i>

136
00:12:17,536 --> 00:12:21,073
<i>As you can see, Keith,
I'm being relieved of command.</i>

137
00:13:10,689 --> 00:13:12,281
What are you looking at?

138
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:08,377
You're welcome.

139
00:14:09,181 --> 00:14:11,376
Obviously, you know,
we think your resume is impressive

140
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:12,781
or you wouldn't be sitting here.

141
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:15,252
So this interview is 
basically a formality.

142
00:14:15,387 --> 00:14:19,915
But I am head of town council,
so I guess it's my job to ask.

143
00:14:20,893 --> 00:14:23,453
We talked to your Captain...

144
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:26,221
- Cronjager.
- Cronjager.

145
00:14:26,732 --> 00:14:28,723
And he speaks well of you, but...

146
00:14:28,801 --> 00:14:31,235
He fired me for being 
drunk on the job.

147
00:14:36,075 --> 00:14:37,599
He said he thought it might 
have something to do

148
00:14:37,676 --> 00:14:38,938
with problems in your marriage.

149
00:14:39,245 --> 00:14:42,271
I guess I did go off the deep end 
for a bit, but I'm fine now.

150
00:14:42,414 --> 00:14:44,678
So, it wasn't an ongoing thing,
you just went through a rough patch

151
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:47,241
in your marriage and you needed 
a drink. I've been there myself.

152
00:14:47,353 --> 00:14:50,083
You know, when a man like you with your
record applies for a job like this...

153
00:14:50,322 --> 00:14:52,790
I just think you had a few 
too many drinks, I mean...

154
00:14:52,858 --> 00:14:55,656
Most of us would have done the same 
thing under the circumstances.

155
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:57,423
I don't have a problem 
here, do you, Lou?

156
00:14:57,596 --> 00:14:59,120
No problem, Hasty.

157
00:15:02,368 --> 00:15:04,427
You make sure you give 
these to the kids.

158
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:06,500
I'm gonna miss you, Lou.

159
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:09,630
What's the new guy like?

160
00:15:10,276 --> 00:15:11,766
He seemed nice,

161
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:14,971
-except he smelled like a brewery.
-You're kidding me.

162
00:15:15,047 --> 00:15:16,139
Hi!

163
00:15:16,215 --> 00:15:19,343
Hey, Jesse, this is Molly Crane.

164
00:15:19,818 --> 00:15:21,911
Molly, this is Jesse Stone, 
your new chief.

165
00:15:22,021 --> 00:15:24,114
- Nice to meet you, Molly.
- And you.

166
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:26,653
This is Boomer.

167
00:15:27,559 --> 00:15:30,619
Well, I was just packing up 
a few things. I'll...

168
00:15:31,263 --> 00:15:32,628
Don't let me run you out.

169
00:15:32,698 --> 00:15:34,689
As a matter of fact,
I'd like to talk to you if I could.

170
00:15:35,567 --> 00:15:37,967
Sure. Please.

171
00:15:50,382 --> 00:15:51,940
Weird sitting here.

172
00:15:52,651 --> 00:15:54,482
Is this a first-name department?

173
00:15:54,753 --> 00:15:56,584
- Has been.
- Good.

174
00:15:57,523 --> 00:16:00,492
- How you feel about retiring?
- Relieved.

175
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:03,153
- You didn't like being chief?
- Not really.

176
00:16:03,329 --> 00:16:04,956
Pay's not worth the aggravation.

177
00:16:05,331 --> 00:16:06,889
Tell me about the aggravation.

178
00:16:07,166 --> 00:16:09,726
You, you're used to 
a big force, big city.

179
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:12,600
Here, you're an employee 
of the town.

180
00:16:12,738 --> 00:16:15,673
And sometimes the 
town and the police

181
00:16:15,741 --> 00:16:18,505
don't exactly agree
on how things should get done.

182
00:16:18,577 --> 00:16:20,704
That's exactly what I'm used to.

183
00:16:22,281 --> 00:16:23,543
So, what're you going to do?

184
00:16:24,616 --> 00:16:27,551
I was going to throw the fishing rod
in the back of the car and drive.

185
00:16:27,619 --> 00:16:29,211
Never did that before.

186
00:16:29,288 --> 00:16:30,550
Always wanted to.

187
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:33,454
Mr. Stone, it's your new boss.

188
00:16:33,559 --> 00:16:35,823
Just press the lighted button.

189
00:16:44,703 --> 00:16:46,102
Change your mind?

190
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:49,663
<i>Listen, Jesse, we're having a little
fundraiser at our yacht club Saturday.</i>

191
00:16:49,775 --> 00:16:51,538
<i>I think you should be there.</i>

192
00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:53,908
<i>- I will be.
- Good.</i>

193
00:16:58,183 --> 00:17:00,208
Well, good luck.

194
00:17:00,953 --> 00:17:02,545
Thank you, Lou.

195
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:28,980
Here's Lou Carson's badge and gun.
They belong to the department.

196
00:17:29,148 --> 00:17:32,049
Thanks, but I got my own gun.
I will need a permit.

197
00:17:32,117 --> 00:17:33,345
Yes, you will.

198
00:17:33,452 --> 00:17:35,317
And I guess I'll need 
some business cards.

199
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:36,979
Well, I think you 
should get some.

200
00:17:42,094 --> 00:17:44,688
What exactly do you do, Molly?

201
00:17:44,763 --> 00:17:46,321
I'm a police officer.

202
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:48,559
Actually, most of the time,
I'm the dispatcher.

203
00:17:48,634 --> 00:17:49,726
Who do you dispatch?

204
00:17:49,802 --> 00:17:53,568
-Usually one of two people, small town.
-You know a good realtor?

205
00:17:53,639 --> 00:17:57,575
I know who my boss would recommend.
I think I got a card someplace.

206
00:18:16,161 --> 00:18:19,927
Officer Simpson just called. They have
a domestic dispute out on Sylvan Road.

207
00:18:19,998 --> 00:18:21,363
I think you should be there.

208
00:18:21,667 --> 00:18:23,157
Okay.

209
00:18:26,238 --> 00:18:28,229
You know where Sylvan Road is?

210
00:18:30,375 --> 00:18:31,933
No.

211
00:18:34,046 --> 00:18:35,604
Thank you.

212
00:18:37,683 --> 00:18:41,642
I don't think I smell like 
a brewery. I was drinking Scotch.

213
00:19:07,246 --> 00:19:08,975
- Jesse Stone.
- Luther Simpson.

214
00:19:09,047 --> 00:19:10,344
Walk with me.

215
00:19:11,183 --> 00:19:12,377
Carole Genest called us.

216
00:19:12,451 --> 00:19:15,147
Said her ex-husband forced his way
into the house, threatened her.

217
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:17,415
- Who's the kid?
- Their daughter.

218
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:20,688
He's pretty belligerent. D'Angelo's 
up there  trying to calm him down.

219
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:22,453
Don't let her come in.

220
00:19:26,031 --> 00:19:28,761
Why don't you give me the 
divorce? What do you want?

221
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:30,461
- You want money?
- You got money.

222
00:19:30,636 --> 00:19:33,161
- So what! So what!
- Anthony D'Angelo. How are you doing?

223
00:19:33,739 --> 00:19:36,674
- Any more kids in the house?
- There's a couple of kids upstairs.

224
00:19:36,742 --> 00:19:38,175
- Who are you?
- You got kids, Anthony?

225
00:19:38,577 --> 00:19:40,067
Yeah, I got three.

226
00:19:40,245 --> 00:19:43,043
-Do what you can to make them feel safe.
-Okay.

227
00:19:43,115 --> 00:19:45,083
Hey, buddy, I said, who are you?

228
00:19:50,722 --> 00:19:52,553
I'm the new police chief, sir.

229
00:19:53,659 --> 00:19:56,184
Oh, yeah. I heard about you.

230
00:19:56,261 --> 00:19:58,161
Only good things, I hope.

231
00:19:58,263 --> 00:19:59,730
Oh, you're a funny guy.

232
00:20:00,832 --> 00:20:03,824
Does Mrs. Genest have
a restraining order on you, sir?

233
00:20:03,936 --> 00:20:04,960
Yeah, so?

234
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:06,902
He's gonna kill me one day, 
the bastard.

235
00:20:06,972 --> 00:20:09,372
-Did he say he was going to kill you?
-Every time I see him.

236
00:20:09,441 --> 00:20:12,899
-Can you people do anything about him?
-Yes, ma'am, we can.

237
00:20:12,978 --> 00:20:15,970
Did he hit you or 
in any way assault you?

238
00:20:16,148 --> 00:20:17,410
No, not this time.

239
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:22,782
She's okay.

240
00:20:23,855 --> 00:20:24,981
Did he force his way in?

241
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:29,118
Yeah, yeah, I tried to lock the 
door, but he's still got a key.

242
00:20:29,261 --> 00:20:31,695
- It's my house.
- Has he assaulted you in the past?

243
00:20:31,763 --> 00:20:34,254
Sure, he's beat the crap out of me
a lot of times.

244
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:36,460
Well, we probably don't have
an assault charge here.

245
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:39,367
We may get forced entry
even though he had a key.

246
00:20:39,438 --> 00:20:43,101
But obviously, we've got him for
violating the restraining order.

247
00:20:43,175 --> 00:20:45,643
Restraining order don't mean crap,
and you know it.

248
00:20:46,211 --> 00:20:47,508
Yes, sir, I know.

249
00:20:48,013 --> 00:20:51,414
I just go to court with my lawyer,
they issue a new restraining order.

250
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:53,244
I am out of there in 20 minutes.

251
00:20:53,318 --> 00:20:55,650
That's the way it usually works,
especially if you've got some money.

252
00:20:55,721 --> 00:20:57,120
Which I do.

253
00:20:58,590 --> 00:20:59,887
So...

254
00:21:00,192 --> 00:21:04,288
I guess that means I get to come 
in here and visit my wife

255
00:21:05,764 --> 00:21:07,493
just as much as I please.

256
00:21:09,568 --> 00:21:11,058
Is that true?

257
00:21:13,538 --> 00:21:15,005
You just said there's nothing 
you can do about it.

258
00:21:15,073 --> 00:21:19,032
No, sir, I said the restraining 
order probably wouldn't work.

259
00:21:19,511 --> 00:21:20,944
Isn't that the same thing?

260
00:21:21,513 --> 00:21:22,741
Not really.

261
00:21:32,658 --> 00:21:34,387
If you come near 
this woman again,

262
00:21:34,726 --> 00:21:38,526
if anything happens to her, 
or her kids,no matter what,

263
00:21:38,764 --> 00:21:40,527
no matter whose fault it is,

264
00:21:40,599 --> 00:21:44,501
I will kick you around this town
until you look like road kill.

265
00:21:46,171 --> 00:21:49,163
And if you're annoying, 
like you were today,

266
00:21:50,275 --> 00:21:52,436
I just might shoot you.

267
00:21:55,113 --> 00:21:58,082
Stay here with D'Angelo
until Mr. Genest leaves.

268
00:21:58,350 --> 00:21:59,977
What if he comes back?

269
00:22:00,285 --> 00:22:02,810
I don't think he'll come back.

270
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:13,658
Molly, can I get a cup of coffee?

271
00:22:13,965 --> 00:22:15,626
If you make it.

272
00:22:15,701 --> 00:22:19,262
Just because I'm the dispatcher
doesn't mean I can't do police work.

273
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:29,337
We need to talk.

274
00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:35,517
I should have introduced myself earlier.
I'm Abby Taylor, the city attorney.

275
00:22:35,587 --> 00:22:36,611
Jesse Stone.

276
00:22:36,688 --> 00:22:39,088
- May I call you Jesse?
- Of course, Abby.

277
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:45,425
Whatever the circumstances
of your police work in Los Angeles,

278
00:22:45,797 --> 00:22:48,789
this is a town where everyone's
civil liberties are important.

279
00:22:48,867 --> 00:22:52,200
Now, I can certainly sympathize
with Carole Genest's situation,

280
00:22:52,304 --> 00:22:54,636
but you cannot go around
beating people up.

281
00:22:55,006 --> 00:22:57,133
- Can I ask you a question?
- Of course.

282
00:22:57,442 --> 00:23:01,003
You asked if you could call me Jesse.
I said you could, but you didn't.

283
00:23:01,646 --> 00:23:03,807
- Excuse me?
- You didn't use my name.

284
00:23:04,249 --> 00:23:07,275
What does that have to do
with you assaulting Mr. Genest?

285
00:23:07,552 --> 00:23:08,917
Just seemed odd to me.

286
00:23:10,689 --> 00:23:14,352
Do you have anything to say on the matter 
of your assault on Mr. Genest?

287
00:23:14,626 --> 00:23:18,255
The restraining order wasn't working.
Think of me as implementing it.

288
00:23:18,563 --> 00:23:21,532
You really need to take 
this more seriously.

289
00:23:25,370 --> 00:23:29,204
You really need to take
this more seriously, Jesse.

290
00:23:30,108 --> 00:23:33,441
You really need to take
this more seriously, Jesse.

291
00:23:33,512 --> 00:23:35,036
No, I don't, Abby.

292
00:23:35,113 --> 00:23:37,104
You don't make it easy, Jesse.

293
00:23:37,182 --> 00:23:40,049
Joe Genest should be kicked
in the gonads once a day.

294
00:23:40,218 --> 00:23:42,584
It was necessary to 
get his attention.

295
00:23:42,654 --> 00:23:45,350
The town council is prepared
to go forward from here,

296
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:46,884
but they would like your assurance

297
00:23:46,958 --> 00:23:49,188
that something like this
will not occur in the future.

298
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:52,196
- It might.
- You don't give an inch, do you?

299
00:23:52,330 --> 00:23:53,695
Jesse.

300
00:23:54,132 --> 00:23:55,258
Jesse.

301
00:23:57,335 --> 00:24:00,270
Have you had much experience
with people like Mr. Genest?

302
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:03,875
People in South Central L.A.
would keep Joe Genest for a pet.

303
00:24:03,942 --> 00:24:05,409
Are you married, Abby?

304
00:24:06,611 --> 00:24:07,839
No.

305
00:24:07,946 --> 00:24:10,710
I don't see what that has to do
with the issue before us.

306
00:24:10,782 --> 00:24:12,079
Me, either.

307
00:24:12,317 --> 00:24:13,511
Have you ever been married?

308
00:24:13,585 --> 00:24:15,382
- Yes.
- But you're not married now?

309
00:24:15,454 --> 00:24:16,478
No.

310
00:24:16,555 --> 00:24:17,749
- Divorced?
- Yes.

311
00:24:19,257 --> 00:24:22,886
Jesse, one of the rules of conversation
is that when asked a question,

312
00:24:22,961 --> 00:24:24,861
you don't give a one-word answer.

313
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:27,922
Okay, want to have dinner with me?

314
00:24:29,835 --> 00:24:31,325
Yes.

315
00:24:42,214 --> 00:24:43,306
It's good.

316
00:24:44,015 --> 00:24:45,505
Holster your weapon.

317
00:24:46,718 --> 00:24:47,878
You might want to 
get into the habit

318
00:24:47,953 --> 00:24:50,012
of keeping your finger
outside the trigger guard.

319
00:24:50,555 --> 00:24:51,613
If you're handling a suspect,

320
00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:54,352
you might get a sympathetic 
response and shoot somebody.

321
00:24:54,793 --> 00:24:58,194
And you don't just stand there,
you shoot and move.

322
00:25:04,870 --> 00:25:07,065
How'd you learn 
to shoot like that?

323
00:25:07,572 --> 00:25:08,834
Practice.

324
00:25:16,181 --> 00:25:18,615
So, in a fight, front sight.

325
00:25:21,052 --> 00:25:24,112
You hear I was drunk 
at my job interview?

326
00:25:24,723 --> 00:25:26,520
I did hear something about that.

327
00:25:26,691 --> 00:25:27,851
- Small town.
- Small town.

328
00:25:30,529 --> 00:25:33,862
I wouldn't have 
hired me, would you?

329
00:25:34,499 --> 00:25:37,627
Well, I don't know.

330
00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:41,871
Any idea why Lou Carson retired?

331
00:25:42,607 --> 00:25:44,131
I don't know.

332
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:50,146
<i>Hello, you've reached Paradise 
Realty. Please leave a message.</i>

333
00:25:51,249 --> 00:25:54,377
My name's Jesse Stone. I'm 
calling about finding a residence.

334
00:25:54,486 --> 00:25:57,512
You can reach me at the 
police station. Thank you.

335
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:00,380
<i>- I'll start with an egg.
- All righty.</i>

336
00:26:00,458 --> 00:26:02,483
<i>One egg. Now, you don't
have to use eggs.</i>

337
00:27:23,341 --> 00:27:24,899
Paradise Police Station.

338
00:27:25,210 --> 00:27:28,008
- Hey, Molly.
- Hey, Lou. Where are you?

339
00:27:28,146 --> 00:27:29,477
I don't know.

340
00:27:30,181 --> 00:27:31,739
Doesn't really matter.

341
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:34,682
This just doesn't 
make any sense.

342
00:27:35,854 --> 00:27:38,823
Maybe you'll be 
surprised about Stone.

343
00:27:39,724 --> 00:27:42,022
He's got more iron in him
than I was expecting.

344
00:27:42,093 --> 00:27:43,560
Yeah, maybe I won't.

345
00:27:43,628 --> 00:27:45,755
Boy, does this guy have baggage.

346
00:27:49,067 --> 00:27:52,594
Listen, Molly, there's 
something I want you to know.

347
00:27:53,872 --> 00:27:55,897
<i>I always enjoyed 
working with you.</i>

348
00:27:57,509 --> 00:27:59,534
And I consider you my friend.

349
00:28:00,645 --> 00:28:02,135
Thanks, Lou.

350
00:28:02,547 --> 00:28:03,946
<i>Keep in touch.</i>

351
00:28:04,916 --> 00:28:06,713
Bye, Molly.

352
00:28:30,875 --> 00:28:31,864
What are you doing?

353
00:29:24,996 --> 00:29:26,930
I don't think he'll 
do that again.

354
00:29:27,732 --> 00:29:29,427
Maybe not if you're around.

355
00:29:30,135 --> 00:29:32,160
He hasn't bothered 
me since that day.

356
00:29:34,205 --> 00:29:36,264
How long are you going to
stick around here for?

357
00:29:37,575 --> 00:29:38,906
I don't know.

358
00:29:42,447 --> 00:29:45,746
I'm worried about Michelle. 
She's older...

359
00:29:45,817 --> 00:29:48,684
- How old is she?
- Fifteen.

360
00:29:48,753 --> 00:29:50,243
- Tough age.
- Yeah.

361
00:29:51,322 --> 00:29:53,187
She took the divorce really hard.

362
00:29:53,925 --> 00:29:56,951
- She hates her dad.
- That's too bad.

363
00:29:57,095 --> 00:29:59,757
- You think so?
- Fathers are important.

364
00:30:01,599 --> 00:30:03,965
- You want some more coffee?
- Yes, thank you.

365
00:30:07,005 --> 00:30:09,405
- Luther?
- Yes, ma'am.

366
00:30:11,242 --> 00:30:13,210
You get the house as 
part of the divorce?

367
00:30:13,278 --> 00:30:15,143
Yeah, yeah.

368
00:30:16,014 --> 00:30:18,039
He's supposed to pay me alimony,
but he never does.

369
00:30:18,116 --> 00:30:19,845
Must be tough to keep 
the payments up.

370
00:30:19,951 --> 00:30:20,940
Well, I...

371
00:30:21,252 --> 00:30:24,346
You know,I got to pay taxes quarterly,
but at least there's no mortgage.

372
00:30:24,422 --> 00:30:26,083
- Well, that's good.
- Yeah.

373
00:30:26,157 --> 00:30:28,682
Joe bought it for cash 
when we got married.

374
00:30:31,930 --> 00:30:33,227
What's he do?

375
00:30:36,668 --> 00:30:40,764
He works in Boston.
He never shared his work with me.

376
00:30:41,339 --> 00:30:45,207
My ex-husband has 
a very bad temper.

377
00:30:46,110 --> 00:30:48,578
I learned very early 
not to question him.

378
00:30:50,215 --> 00:30:53,651
Besides, I'm not very smart.

379
00:30:54,419 --> 00:30:57,820
I never learned anything in 
school. I didn't even graduate.

380
00:30:58,156 --> 00:31:00,420
Taking care of me was 
his job, right?

381
00:31:01,626 --> 00:31:03,321
Well, I'll talk to him.

382
00:31:04,529 --> 00:31:07,020
You know, you're going
to need to be careful.

383
00:31:07,632 --> 00:31:10,931
Joe's mean. He's gonna 
wanna get even.

384
00:31:12,203 --> 00:31:13,727
Joe's a fake.

385
00:31:14,205 --> 00:31:18,335
Sometimes for a minute he knows it
and he knows that I know it, too.

386
00:31:18,877 --> 00:31:20,902
He isn't really tough.

387
00:31:21,379 --> 00:31:22,846
And you are?

388
00:31:23,848 --> 00:31:25,475
Yes, ma'am. I am.

389
00:31:28,987 --> 00:31:31,888
I find dealing with cash
unbelievably tedious.

390
00:31:31,956 --> 00:31:33,548
Yeah, but you're 
pretty good at that.

391
00:31:33,625 --> 00:31:36,458
Started as a teller, 
worked my way up.

392
00:31:39,864 --> 00:31:43,197
I hear you had a little run-in
with our new chief.

393
00:31:43,735 --> 00:31:46,203
Yeah, the son of 
a bitch blindsided me.

394
00:31:46,571 --> 00:31:50,530
I hope your little personal and petty
problems with him don't get in our way.

395
00:31:50,608 --> 00:31:52,337
He's the chief of police.

396
00:31:53,811 --> 00:31:55,039
So what?

397
00:31:55,213 --> 00:31:59,377
I get $1,114,905.
 You wanna do a recount?

398
00:31:59,450 --> 00:32:00,815
I'll take your count.

399
00:32:00,885 --> 00:32:04,343
Okay, well, then, your share
of my eight percent...

400
00:32:05,490 --> 00:32:07,424
$22,298.

401
00:32:08,026 --> 00:32:10,153
Oh, that's the wrong 
number, Hasty.

402
00:32:10,795 --> 00:32:12,558
We're equal partners now.

403
00:32:13,665 --> 00:32:15,155
Well, Joe, I don't 
want to diminish

404
00:32:15,233 --> 00:32:17,360
your very valuable contribution
to this little enterprise,

405
00:32:17,435 --> 00:32:18,902
but there's no way in hell
you're getting half...

406
00:32:19,003 --> 00:32:20,766
Lou Carson's dead.

407
00:32:24,075 --> 00:32:25,235
What?

408
00:32:25,343 --> 00:32:27,868
He had a terrible accident.

409
00:32:34,218 --> 00:32:36,550
What an incredibly 
stupid thing to do.

410
00:32:37,121 --> 00:32:39,851
Don't worry, they're 
never gonna find him.

411
00:32:40,258 --> 00:32:43,091
He knew everything.
Come on, he was a danger to us.

412
00:32:44,562 --> 00:32:48,020
- He never would have said a word.
- What difference does it make?

413
00:32:48,099 --> 00:32:49,327
He's dead.

414
00:32:51,336 --> 00:32:53,327
That makes you an accessory.

415
00:32:54,272 --> 00:32:55,296
So...

416
00:32:55,807 --> 00:32:57,206
From now on

417
00:32:58,476 --> 00:32:59,807
I get half.

418
00:33:01,512 --> 00:33:02,672
Thanks.

419
00:33:04,015 --> 00:33:06,745
I wouldn't have figured you
for a beer drinker.

420
00:33:07,385 --> 00:33:09,910
I'm not. I'm a Scotch 
on the rocks drinker.

421
00:33:10,588 --> 00:33:13,352
Just didn't want to get drunk
on our first date.

422
00:33:13,624 --> 00:33:15,091
Do you get drunk?

423
00:33:15,326 --> 00:33:17,817
I have trouble stopping 
when I start.

424
00:33:19,230 --> 00:33:21,994
Is that what happened 
on the job interview?

425
00:33:23,201 --> 00:33:25,669
Actually, I had way too much 
the night before.

426
00:33:25,737 --> 00:33:29,400
I just made the mistake of having 
one in the morning to steady up.

427
00:33:31,009 --> 00:33:34,672
Well, he hired you anyway, so 
he must have seen something in you.

428
00:33:35,513 --> 00:33:38,380
- Maybe.
- Why maybe?

429
00:33:38,950 --> 00:33:40,884
I wouldn't have hired me.

430
00:33:43,021 --> 00:33:44,921
What's your take on our boss?

431
00:33:45,490 --> 00:33:49,756
My father told me to never trust 
a man that smiles all the time.

432
00:33:49,827 --> 00:33:51,294
That's good advice.

433
00:33:52,296 --> 00:33:54,696
If you want a Scotch, go ahead.

434
00:33:55,133 --> 00:33:57,158
I'm willing to risk 
it if you are.

435
00:34:01,939 --> 00:34:04,464
Did your ex-wife ever remarry?

436
00:34:04,542 --> 00:34:07,102
No, but she's in another 
guy's bed a lot.

437
00:34:07,345 --> 00:34:09,210
And that hurts.

438
00:34:12,283 --> 00:34:15,013
Maybe it would help 
if you got even.

439
00:34:22,393 --> 00:34:25,760
I think coffee and donuts
tend to certify one's copness.

440
00:34:25,830 --> 00:34:27,263
Thanks for buying.

441
00:34:27,932 --> 00:34:30,298
I'm trying to prove 
I'm a regular guy.

442
00:34:32,470 --> 00:34:34,062
Luther your real name?

443
00:34:34,138 --> 00:34:37,505
My mother teaches Sunday school.
She's a very religious person.

444
00:34:37,575 --> 00:34:39,907
Named me after 
some religious guy.

445
00:34:39,977 --> 00:34:42,036
Gym teacher called me Spider
when I was in the fourth grade

446
00:34:42,113 --> 00:34:43,705
and that stuck for a while.

447
00:34:43,781 --> 00:34:47,842
- I don't see you as a Spider.
- Well, what do you see me as?

448
00:34:48,252 --> 00:34:50,049
Stop the car, Suitcase.

449
00:34:50,121 --> 00:34:51,713
- What did you say?
- Stop the car.

450
00:34:51,789 --> 00:34:53,279
No, after that.

451
00:35:03,534 --> 00:35:06,128
Drive around the block a couple 
of times, Suitcase.

452
00:35:19,884 --> 00:35:21,784
You gonna run me out 
of here or what?

453
00:35:21,853 --> 00:35:22,911
No.

454
00:35:23,087 --> 00:35:26,614
You come here, you smoke dope.
I chase you out, you come back.

455
00:35:26,691 --> 00:35:28,386
It's a waste of my time and yours.

456
00:35:28,826 --> 00:35:31,852
-You gonna kick me in the nuts?
-That would be difficult.

457
00:35:34,999 --> 00:35:36,364
You know,

458
00:35:37,368 --> 00:35:40,531
-you can't prove I'm smoking dope.
-Doesn't matter.

459
00:35:40,605 --> 00:35:42,232
So, why don't you just
leave me alone, then?

460
00:35:42,306 --> 00:35:45,139
-Why don't you go to school?
-School sucks.

461
00:35:55,019 --> 00:35:57,487
So, I guess you just think it's 
okay to push me around?

462
00:35:57,555 --> 00:36:00,456
-Am I pushing you around, Michelle?
-How do you know my name?

463
00:36:00,525 --> 00:36:02,925
I'm the police chief, 
I know everything.

464
00:36:06,464 --> 00:36:08,955
You know, I saw you going
into the Gray Gull last night.

465
00:36:09,834 --> 00:36:11,301
Small town.

466
00:36:11,836 --> 00:36:14,066
Aren't you a little old for her?

467
00:36:14,572 --> 00:36:17,700
I don't know. Maybe I'll ask her.

468
00:36:17,942 --> 00:36:19,637
Did you have a drink?

469
00:36:20,444 --> 00:36:22,105
Yes, I did.

470
00:36:22,246 --> 00:36:24,476
So how come that's okay
and smoking dope isn't?

471
00:36:24,549 --> 00:36:27,575
It's legal, and smoking 
dope is illegal.

472
00:36:27,652 --> 00:36:30,951
- So that makes it right?
- Nope, just legal and illegal.

473
00:36:31,556 --> 00:36:34,491
- Well, that sucks.
- A lot of things suck.

474
00:36:35,459 --> 00:36:40,226
You said stuff was just legal or illegal.
Well,what about it being right or wrong?

475
00:36:40,298 --> 00:36:44,064
I'm not in the right and wrong business.
I'm in the legal and illegal business.

476
00:36:44,135 --> 00:36:47,104
- You just don't want to answer.
- No, I don't mind answering.

477
00:36:47,572 --> 00:36:50,097
Actually, that was 
part of my answer.

478
00:36:50,741 --> 00:36:53,335
You and I both know that 
sitting around here all day

479
00:36:53,411 --> 00:36:55,936
smoking dope isn't the right thing
to do with your life.

480
00:36:56,013 --> 00:36:58,311
Who the hell are you
to say what's right for me?

481
00:36:58,583 --> 00:37:00,050
The guy you asked.

482
00:37:06,057 --> 00:37:09,686
Most people don't have trouble 
seeing what's right and wrong.

483
00:37:09,927 --> 00:37:12,418
Doing it is sometimes complicated,

484
00:37:12,496 --> 00:37:15,226
but knowing what's right
usually isn't so hard.

485
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:19,692
And chasing you out of here
is obviously not the right way

486
00:37:19,971 --> 00:37:21,939
to help you do the right thing.

487
00:37:22,173 --> 00:37:26,303
- So, why are you still here?
- Trying to do the right thing.

488
00:37:37,054 --> 00:37:38,578
It has a living area.

489
00:37:38,656 --> 00:37:41,625
It has a kitchen with a dining 
area and a half bath.

490
00:37:41,692 --> 00:37:43,683
- Mrs. Hathaway...
- Cissy.

491
00:37:44,528 --> 00:37:46,120
I think I want a house.

492
00:37:46,597 --> 00:37:48,497
Excuse me, Jesse,
I don't mean to offend you,

493
00:37:48,566 --> 00:37:51,000
but within your budget range...

494
00:37:51,902 --> 00:37:53,199
You know, it's 
the people from Boston,

495
00:37:53,271 --> 00:37:56,138
they keep coming up here
and driving the prices up.

496
00:37:57,575 --> 00:38:00,135
Actually, there is 
a place I could show you.

497
00:38:01,078 --> 00:38:02,739
It's absolutely charming.

498
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:06,507
You have the ocean on both sides,
and it's extremely private.

499
00:38:06,584 --> 00:38:09,576
Pretty isolated. 
Where's the garage?

500
00:38:09,654 --> 00:38:11,713
Well, there isn't one.

501
00:38:11,789 --> 00:38:15,190
But you just park your car back 
there and take this bridge.

502
00:38:16,127 --> 00:38:18,823
Might be a drag if you're 
carrying groceries.

503
00:38:24,802 --> 00:38:26,360
This is it.

504
00:38:31,475 --> 00:38:33,409
Floors are originals of the house.

505
00:38:33,477 --> 00:38:35,775
You don't see craftsmanship
like that anymore.

506
00:38:35,846 --> 00:38:40,044
And it's very reasonable.
Well within your budget range.

507
00:38:40,518 --> 00:38:43,385
- You mean, it's cheap?
- Exactly.

508
00:38:45,456 --> 00:38:46,787
I'll take it.

509
00:38:47,425 --> 00:38:50,394
I think you're going to be 
very happy here, Jesse.

510
00:38:52,296 --> 00:38:53,957
You think so?

511
00:38:58,703 --> 00:39:02,537
-Well, thanks, Skipper.
-D'Angelo, please,don't call me Skipper.

512
00:39:02,807 --> 00:39:06,504
- Your appointment's here.
- I don't have an appointment.

513
00:39:11,248 --> 00:39:13,079
- Jesse?
- Yeah.

514
00:39:13,718 --> 00:39:16,118
I'm Captain Healey,
State Police, Homicide Commander.

515
00:39:16,187 --> 00:39:18,280
Nice to meet you. Sit down.

516
00:39:19,757 --> 00:39:22,726
I work out of Boston, 
but I live up this way.

517
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:26,921
- I've been meaning to stop by.
- I'm glad you did.

518
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:32,667
- You like Scotch?
- I do.

519
00:39:32,737 --> 00:39:35,672
- Want some pizza?
- No, thanks.

520
00:39:36,006 --> 00:39:38,099
I like pizza, it don't like me.

521
00:39:39,110 --> 00:39:40,907
So, I hear

522
00:39:41,879 --> 00:39:44,712
- you're up from L.A., right?
- Right.

523
00:39:44,782 --> 00:39:47,876
-That's a long way from Paradise.
-Long way.

524
00:39:48,552 --> 00:39:50,577
You worked homicide?

525
00:39:51,088 --> 00:39:52,248
Yeah.

526
00:39:53,023 --> 00:39:54,615
I know Cronjager.

527
00:39:57,428 --> 00:39:58,918
How's it going?

528
00:40:00,431 --> 00:40:01,898
I don't drink

529
00:40:02,566 --> 00:40:03,863
on the job.

530
00:40:05,369 --> 00:40:07,564
Good night, Skipper. 
You gonna lock up?

531
00:40:07,638 --> 00:40:10,004
- I will.
- Thanks.

532
00:40:11,175 --> 00:40:14,474
So, I hear you used 
to play ball.

533
00:40:14,545 --> 00:40:17,309
Double-A, tore up my shoulder, 
and that was that.

534
00:40:17,581 --> 00:40:20,243
The Phillies signed 
e as a pitcher.

535
00:40:20,551 --> 00:40:24,749
- And?
- And I wasn't good enough.

536
00:40:26,791 --> 00:40:28,190
You miss it?

537
00:40:29,226 --> 00:40:30,557
Every day.

538
00:40:37,701 --> 00:40:39,362
Lou Carson's dead.

539
00:40:41,205 --> 00:40:43,833
Went off the road, 
drowned in his car.

540
00:40:44,675 --> 00:40:46,802
There weren't any witnesses.

541
00:40:47,011 --> 00:40:50,071
The local police aren't even 
sure when it happened.

542
00:40:50,147 --> 00:40:53,776
Their ME says he's been in 
the water at least a few days.

543
00:40:54,084 --> 00:40:57,520
Found alcohol in his blood.
Lou liked to drink.

544
00:40:58,489 --> 00:40:59,683
Family?

545
00:41:01,492 --> 00:41:03,960
Divorced, lived alone.

546
00:41:04,195 --> 00:41:07,130
So nobody reported him missing.

547
00:41:07,264 --> 00:41:10,165
If the fisherman hadn't seen
his car in the water...

548
00:41:11,402 --> 00:41:13,632
You released it 
to the press yet?

549
00:41:14,405 --> 00:41:17,238
Not yet. I'm gonna hold it.

550
00:41:17,308 --> 00:41:20,641
Take a look at it.
Make sure it was an accident.

551
00:41:20,711 --> 00:41:23,305
- Doesn't sound right.
- Why?

552
00:41:25,516 --> 00:41:27,177
No reason.

553
00:41:32,456 --> 00:41:35,948
Anyway, I thought 
you should know.

554
00:42:52,903 --> 00:42:56,202
<i>Welcome to Northeastern Bell.
If you have any problems...</i>

555
00:43:08,118 --> 00:43:09,449
<i>- Hello.
- Hi.</i>

556
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:12,384
<i>- Hi.
- You okay?</i>

557
00:43:12,890 --> 00:43:14,255
<i>Not really.</i>

558
00:43:14,458 --> 00:43:15,982
<i>Broke up with Elliott.</i>

559
00:43:16,060 --> 00:43:17,220
I'm shocked.

560
00:43:17,761 --> 00:43:20,525
<i>Don't make fun of me, Jesse. 
It's too easy.</i>

561
00:43:21,732 --> 00:43:22,960
I'm sorry.

562
00:43:24,868 --> 00:43:27,234
<i>You think I'm a dreadfuI fooI,
don't you, Jesse?</i>

563
00:43:27,304 --> 00:43:29,704
I think you do foolish things
sometimes, Jenn.

564
00:43:29,773 --> 00:43:31,434
I don't think you're dreadful.

565
00:43:32,242 --> 00:43:33,766
<i>Have you met anyone?</i>

566
00:43:34,511 --> 00:43:35,739
Yes.

567
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:37,604
<i>Do you love her?</i>

568
00:43:39,450 --> 00:43:40,610
Not yet.

569
00:43:43,020 --> 00:43:45,147
I don't think 
I belong here, though.

570
00:43:45,990 --> 00:43:48,151
<i>-You mean, you didn't get the job?
-No, I got the job.</i>

571
00:43:48,225 --> 00:43:50,750
I'm just not so sure 
they should've hired me.

572
00:43:51,562 --> 00:43:54,224
<i>- Are you drinking?
- Not on the job.</i>

573
00:44:37,041 --> 00:44:40,067
I'll need you to drive me 
into town to pick up my car.

574
00:44:42,012 --> 00:44:45,971
I called the towing garage.I'll clean 
up the paint before they get here.

575
00:44:48,952 --> 00:44:50,476
Leave it alone.

576
00:44:54,591 --> 00:44:58,049
Thank you. Sorry about your car.

577
00:45:00,097 --> 00:45:02,827
- Your boss called.
- You don't like him, do you?

578
00:45:02,900 --> 00:45:04,367
I think he's a son of a bitch.

579
00:45:04,435 --> 00:45:08,098
Anyway, he wants you to meet him for
breakfast at the coffee shop in 15 minutes.

580
00:45:08,172 --> 00:45:09,901
I already had breakfast.

581
00:45:16,346 --> 00:45:19,747
- Molly, I know you and Lou were close.
- Still are.

582
00:45:21,719 --> 00:45:23,209
Lou's dead.

583
00:45:24,888 --> 00:45:27,186
He drowned. His car 
went off the road.

584
00:45:27,658 --> 00:45:29,922
- But I just spoke to him.
- When?

585
00:45:30,828 --> 00:45:32,352
First day out.

586
00:45:38,235 --> 00:45:40,533
You want to go home? 
Take the day off?

587
00:45:45,008 --> 00:45:48,273
Molly, I don't want you to talk
about this to anybody.

588
00:45:48,345 --> 00:45:49,903
Even Simpson, D'Angelo.

589
00:45:52,716 --> 00:45:53,910
I'm sorry.

590
00:46:17,074 --> 00:46:19,042
Who do you think
did that to your car, Skipper?

591
00:46:19,777 --> 00:46:20,801
Jesse.

592
00:46:21,145 --> 00:46:23,909
-Jesse.
-Come in.Close the door behind you.

593
00:46:26,750 --> 00:46:29,241
I want this to be between 
just you and me.

594
00:46:34,725 --> 00:46:36,192
I need a hat.

595
00:46:37,161 --> 00:46:38,526
We got hats, Skipper.

596
00:46:39,196 --> 00:46:42,290
How do I put this delicately?
I don't like them.

597
00:46:44,001 --> 00:46:45,025
I'm used to navy blue.

598
00:46:45,102 --> 00:46:48,071
Can you have one made up for me?
PPD, silver letters?

599
00:46:48,972 --> 00:46:52,237
And maybe you could have them 
embroider "Chief" on the back.

600
00:46:52,609 --> 00:46:54,600
- I guess so.
- Good.

601
00:46:55,546 --> 00:46:57,446
Who's gonna pay for it?

602
00:46:59,283 --> 00:47:01,843
- I will.
- Okay.

603
00:47:07,691 --> 00:47:09,386
This may come as 
a complete shock to you,

604
00:47:09,459 --> 00:47:11,120
but I've been hearing
good things about you.

605
00:47:11,195 --> 00:47:13,755
No, I couldn't be happier about
the job you're doing.

606
00:47:13,831 --> 00:47:17,824
Well, I was under the impression you didn't
like the way I handled Joe Genest.

607
00:47:17,901 --> 00:47:22,270
Well, officially that's true. But off the 
record,I think he got what he deserved.

608
00:47:22,706 --> 00:47:26,403
-So you know him?
-Well, I know who he is.It's a small town.

609
00:47:26,643 --> 00:47:28,042
You sure I can't bring 
you anything, Chief?

610
00:47:28,111 --> 00:47:31,205
- No, I already ate. Thanks.
- Thank you, Tammy.

611
00:47:32,950 --> 00:47:36,010
I understand that Captain Healey
was in your office last night.

612
00:47:37,254 --> 00:47:39,245
- Yes.
- How's he doing?

613
00:47:39,323 --> 00:47:41,951
I don't know, he just stopped 
by to introduce himself.

614
00:47:42,025 --> 00:47:44,118
Oh, I see. What did 
you guys talk about?

615
00:47:44,194 --> 00:47:48,028
- Baseball, mostly.
- Baseball. Anything else?

616
00:47:48,498 --> 00:47:49,863
Not really. Why?

617
00:47:50,234 --> 00:47:53,726
Well, it's just that we like to handle
our own problems here in Paradise.

618
00:47:53,804 --> 00:47:57,296
In fact, if you do have a problem, 
Jesse,I'd like you to call me first.

619
00:47:57,374 --> 00:48:00,104
I mean it, I don't care if it's 
the middle of the night, you call me.

620
00:48:00,177 --> 00:48:02,042
- Anytime?
- Anytime.

621
00:48:02,679 --> 00:48:05,273
- Well, I appreciate that, Hasty.
- Sure.

622
00:48:06,116 --> 00:48:08,243
- Thanks for the coffee.
- All right.

623
00:48:08,785 --> 00:48:12,118
You seem to have made a decision
not to wear a uniform.

624
00:48:12,890 --> 00:48:15,950
- Oh, well, actually I...
- It's okay, I don't mind.

625
00:48:16,793 --> 00:48:19,091
I'm growing really 
fond of you, Jesse.

626
00:48:19,496 --> 00:48:21,964
- See you. Yeah.
- See you.

627
00:48:35,512 --> 00:48:38,606
- I think I'm overdressed.
- I told you, small town.

628
00:48:38,682 --> 00:48:42,118
But when I heard yacht club I was
thinking blue blazers and deck shoes.

629
00:48:43,253 --> 00:48:45,414
Well, that's what Hasty's wearing.

630
00:48:45,889 --> 00:48:48,187
The bow tie is his party trademark.

631
00:48:48,425 --> 00:48:51,292
At Christmas, he has one 
with red and green lights.

632
00:48:51,495 --> 00:48:52,928
Sporty guy.

633
00:49:03,607 --> 00:49:05,632
- Hi, Peter.
- Hi, Abby.

634
00:49:05,709 --> 00:49:07,904
Jesse, this is Dr. Peter Perkins.

635
00:49:08,211 --> 00:49:10,441
- I heard about you.
- Everybody says that.

636
00:49:10,514 --> 00:49:13,540
-Peter has a very successful practice here.
-Really?

637
00:49:13,617 --> 00:49:17,018
Jesse Stone.  Abby, could 
I borrow Jesse for a dance?

638
00:49:17,587 --> 00:49:19,851
- A short one.
- Come on.

639
00:49:20,857 --> 00:49:22,222
Nice meeting you.

640
00:49:25,896 --> 00:49:28,660
- So how's the house coming?
- It's charming.

641
00:49:39,309 --> 00:49:42,745
- Do you like my dress?
- Yes, I do.

642
00:49:43,413 --> 00:49:46,576
Can you tell that I'm not wearing
anything underneath it?

643
00:49:46,950 --> 00:49:48,815
I wasn't sure.

644
00:49:49,252 --> 00:49:52,312
Is that something you might be
interested in seeing?

645
00:49:59,763 --> 00:50:01,128
Here's the deal.

646
00:50:01,631 --> 00:50:04,293
I like men and I like sex.

647
00:50:04,968 --> 00:50:08,563
And assuming you're interested,
we could have something very nice

648
00:50:08,805 --> 00:50:12,263
and very uncomplicated
with nothing at stake.

649
00:50:13,510 --> 00:50:14,670
Wow.

650
00:50:15,245 --> 00:50:17,110
Hi. May I cut in?

651
00:50:18,515 --> 00:50:21,746
That was short. By all means.

652
00:50:23,754 --> 00:50:25,745
I didn't know that 
you knew Cissy Hathaway.

653
00:50:25,822 --> 00:50:26,811
Yeah.

654
00:50:27,691 --> 00:50:29,283
She found me my house.

655
00:50:30,727 --> 00:50:34,356
And how does she 
stack up as a kisser?

656
00:50:35,399 --> 00:50:37,162
There's better.

657
00:50:43,106 --> 00:50:46,132
Will trouble find you 
if I use the facilities?

658
00:50:46,443 --> 00:50:47,603
Hard to say.

659
00:50:50,881 --> 00:50:52,280
Jesse.

660
00:50:54,618 --> 00:50:57,610
Scotch on the rocks your drink?
Yeah, I had a feeling.

661
00:50:58,155 --> 00:50:59,679
Want to get some air?

662
00:51:01,058 --> 00:51:02,047
Come on.

663
00:51:10,367 --> 00:51:12,631
Cheers. You having a good time?

664
00:51:14,104 --> 00:51:15,662
Your batteries are low.

665
00:51:16,406 --> 00:51:17,998
There's a switch.

666
00:51:22,045 --> 00:51:24,309
Women are kind of hard to figure,
aren't they?

667
00:51:24,481 --> 00:51:26,176
Yes, they are.

668
00:51:26,249 --> 00:51:30,083
Yeah, I guess you've had your share of
trying to figure them out. Sexual problems?

669
00:51:30,153 --> 00:51:32,212
- Excuse me?
- In your marriage.

670
00:51:32,789 --> 00:51:36,247
Sexual problems. I mean, it's usually sexual
problems that make a marriage hit a reef.

671
00:51:36,326 --> 00:51:38,760
No, we didn't have 
any sexual problems.

672
00:51:39,930 --> 00:51:42,057
- No?
- No.

673
00:51:44,701 --> 00:51:47,295
When we were dating,
she was hotter than Cleopatra.

674
00:51:49,806 --> 00:51:51,535
That's probably
one of the reasons I married her.

675
00:51:51,608 --> 00:51:53,166
When we were dating,

676
00:51:53,343 --> 00:51:55,470
we did everything except it.

677
00:51:55,846 --> 00:51:57,871
She said she didn't want 
to cheapen the relationship.

678
00:51:57,948 --> 00:52:01,179
Kept talking about 
saving it for marriage.

679
00:52:01,451 --> 00:52:04,443
Then when we got married,
she wasn't interested.

680
00:52:06,923 --> 00:52:09,949
She'd lie back, close her 
eyes and think of England.

681
00:52:10,260 --> 00:52:13,388
-I guess marriage is different than dating.
-Yeah.

682
00:52:15,999 --> 00:52:18,695
You ever wonder why 
you weren't enough?

683
00:52:19,503 --> 00:52:20,561
Yes.

684
00:52:25,142 --> 00:52:27,133
Cissy seem frigid to you?

685
00:52:28,245 --> 00:52:30,076
- Hard to say.
- Oh, come on, Jesse.

686
00:52:30,147 --> 00:52:32,047
She embarrassed us both
out there on the dance floor.

687
00:52:32,115 --> 00:52:33,639
She seem frigid to you then?

688
00:52:33,850 --> 00:52:34,874
No.

689
00:52:34,951 --> 00:52:37,146
How come she's frigid at home
and hot with other guys?

690
00:52:37,621 --> 00:52:40,146
I'm a cop, Hasty. 
That's a shrink question.

691
00:52:44,761 --> 00:52:46,490
Funny thing is

692
00:52:49,032 --> 00:52:50,829
I'm still in love with her.

693
00:52:54,604 --> 00:52:56,333
Lou Carson's dead.

694
00:52:58,074 --> 00:53:00,941
- What happened?
- Car accident.

695
00:53:04,014 --> 00:53:05,845
He was looking forward so much
to his retirement.

696
00:53:05,916 --> 00:53:08,214
Hell of a thing to happen
first day of his trip.

697
00:53:08,285 --> 00:53:10,845
How do you know it happened
on the first day?

698
00:53:10,921 --> 00:53:13,446
Well, it was just 
an assumption I made.

699
00:53:13,890 --> 00:53:16,950
- It's a good assumption.
- I was fond of Lou.

700
00:53:21,865 --> 00:53:23,628
I was very fond of Lou.

701
00:53:31,107 --> 00:53:36,170
-What do you do when you have groceries?
-Well, you carry them across the bridge.

702
00:53:36,980 --> 00:53:38,641
It's charming.

703
00:53:47,224 --> 00:53:50,557
-Boomer's not eating.
-It's just the new surroundings.

704
00:53:50,860 --> 00:53:52,589
He'll be fine.

705
00:53:53,430 --> 00:53:55,728
Any plans to furnish 
it at some point?

706
00:53:56,099 --> 00:53:57,930
That's a good idea.

707
00:53:58,635 --> 00:54:01,468
There is a mattress 
in the bedroom.

708
00:54:01,871 --> 00:54:03,270
Do you have a box spring?

709
00:54:03,340 --> 00:54:05,934
I just want to know
what I'm getting myself into.

710
00:54:13,283 --> 00:54:16,150
That's Ozzie. The best 
shortstop that ever lived.

711
00:54:16,686 --> 00:54:19,086
- And that would be baseball?
- Yes.

712
00:54:26,363 --> 00:54:27,455
Thank you.

713
00:54:29,766 --> 00:54:32,462
Jesse, what's going on with you
and Joe Genest?

714
00:54:32,602 --> 00:54:36,538
No shrugging. I asked you 
a question. I expect an answer.

715
00:54:36,773 --> 00:54:38,331
Are you afraid of him?

716
00:54:38,408 --> 00:54:41,468
Joe is stupid and mean
and he doesn't like me.

717
00:54:42,245 --> 00:54:43,678
On the other hand,

718
00:54:43,813 --> 00:54:47,681
if I had to, I could shoot him just 
as easily as if he were smart and kind.

719
00:54:52,756 --> 00:54:54,883
<i>Hi, Jesse. Are you there?</i>

720
00:54:57,894 --> 00:55:00,124
You can pick that 
up if you want to.

721
00:55:00,330 --> 00:55:02,798
<i>You said you were 
trying not to love me.</i>

722
00:55:04,501 --> 00:55:06,128
<i>Are you succeeding?</i>

723
00:55:08,538 --> 00:55:10,904
Well, that was just 
getting interesting.

724
00:55:15,211 --> 00:55:17,042
Do you still love her?

725
00:55:18,148 --> 00:55:21,675
I'm not a good basket to put
all your eggs in at the moment.

726
00:55:23,887 --> 00:55:25,787
Am I too young for you?

727
00:55:26,756 --> 00:55:29,589
Is that another way of saying
I'm too old for you?

728
00:55:30,827 --> 00:55:32,488
Come here.

729
00:55:53,917 --> 00:55:55,248
How old is he?

730
00:55:55,752 --> 00:55:59,119
- Ten.
- Do you see that? Right there?

731
00:55:59,456 --> 00:56:03,222
That's polycystic renal disease.
His kidneys are failing.

732
00:56:07,063 --> 00:56:08,530
What can we do?

733
00:56:08,732 --> 00:56:12,190
Well, nothing, I'm afraid. It's 
often the kidneys that go first.

734
00:56:14,037 --> 00:56:16,505
- Did you breed this dog?
- No. Why?

735
00:56:17,340 --> 00:56:20,309
He's not been neutered.
Any particular reason why?

736
00:56:25,215 --> 00:56:29,083
Somehow I didn't think Boomer
would be Boomer without testicles.

737
00:56:30,053 --> 00:56:34,490
Oh, well, be that as it may,
the end won't be pretty.

738
00:56:35,358 --> 00:56:39,522
I think you need to put him down.
It would be the right thing to do.

739
00:57:31,748 --> 00:57:35,206
Paradise Women's Club. 
Makes me blush.

740
00:57:35,518 --> 00:57:38,487
Maybe it's evolved into 
a powerful force for feminism.

741
00:57:38,922 --> 00:57:40,913
And maybe pigs fly.

742
00:57:44,027 --> 00:57:45,688
- Did you see that?
- What?

743
00:57:46,596 --> 00:57:49,793
Did you see Cissy get all 
wiggly listening to Joe?

744
00:57:50,333 --> 00:57:53,097
I'm telling you,
I think there's something there.

745
00:57:53,203 --> 00:57:54,227
I don't see it.

746
00:57:54,304 --> 00:57:56,329
I think he's plonking her.

747
00:57:56,406 --> 00:57:58,306
- Plonking?
- Yeah.

748
00:57:58,374 --> 00:58:00,103
And you can tell this 
just by looking?

749
00:58:00,176 --> 00:58:02,542
I can. I am wise in these matters.

750
00:58:02,612 --> 00:58:03,806
And why is that?

751
00:58:03,880 --> 00:58:06,007
Because I am blessed with a penis.

752
00:58:07,350 --> 00:58:09,443
Hey, Stone. How about a drink?

753
00:58:09,719 --> 00:58:14,281
Hey. Sorry I couldn't say hi outside 
the vet's, but I was in a rush.

754
00:58:14,657 --> 00:58:17,592
You're not following me around,
are you, Joe?

755
00:58:18,127 --> 00:58:21,153
- How're you doing, little lady?
- I'm fine.

756
00:58:21,264 --> 00:58:22,561
Yes, you are.

757
00:58:22,632 --> 00:58:23,758
What do you do, Joe?

758
00:58:23,833 --> 00:58:25,767
- What?
- For a living?

759
00:58:26,236 --> 00:58:28,932
I don't see how that's 
any of your business.

760
00:58:29,873 --> 00:58:32,137
I was sorry to hear 
about Lou Carson.

761
00:58:32,208 --> 00:58:33,368
What about him?

762
00:58:33,443 --> 00:58:34,933
He was killed.

763
00:58:35,678 --> 00:58:37,703
Where were you 
when it happened?

764
00:58:37,780 --> 00:58:39,247
I got an alibi.

765
00:58:39,315 --> 00:58:41,476
How do you know 
when he was killed?

766
00:58:41,651 --> 00:58:44,745
Whenever it happened, 
I didn't do it.

767
00:58:44,821 --> 00:58:46,118
Do what?

768
00:58:46,422 --> 00:58:48,583
I don't got to listen 
to this crap.

769
00:58:54,464 --> 00:58:56,659
How long have you 
known about this?

770
00:58:58,501 --> 00:58:59,798
How long?

771
00:59:03,172 --> 00:59:04,969
Couple of days.

772
00:59:06,442 --> 00:59:09,900
You may like to stir the pot
and play your stupid little games,

773
00:59:10,146 --> 00:59:12,706
but Lou Carson was 
a friend of mine.

774
00:59:13,917 --> 00:59:17,683
And you should at least be honest
with someone who's sharing your bed.

775
00:59:30,066 --> 00:59:31,124
Captain Healey.

776
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:33,600
It's Jesse. Sorry we've 
been playing phone tag.

777
00:59:33,670 --> 00:59:36,161
The lid's coming off 
on Lou Carson's death.

778
00:59:36,239 --> 00:59:37,467
Thanks for letting me know.

779
00:59:37,540 --> 00:59:39,269
We're still calling it an accident.

780
00:59:39,342 --> 00:59:41,310
Is there a reason we shouldn't?

781
00:59:42,211 --> 00:59:45,305
I don't know. Maybe I just 
like stirring the pot.

782
00:59:45,515 --> 00:59:47,779
- Skipper?
- In a minute.

783
00:59:48,017 --> 00:59:51,919
Listen,I need to talk to you,but I can't do it
on the phone.Can you come down here?

784
00:59:51,988 --> 00:59:53,683
<i>- I can.
- When?</i>

785
00:59:53,756 --> 00:59:55,314
- Today.
- Thanks.

786
00:59:55,391 --> 00:59:56,619
Yeah.

787
00:59:56,693 --> 00:59:58,160
D'Angelo.

788
01:00:00,430 --> 01:00:01,954
What do you think?

789
01:00:06,202 --> 01:00:07,567
It's a good hat.

790
01:00:08,104 --> 01:00:09,401
Here's your receipt.

791
01:00:09,472 --> 01:00:11,872
Did you tell Hasty Hathaway
that Captain Healey

792
01:00:11,941 --> 01:00:14,136
was in my office 
a couple of days ago?

793
01:00:15,244 --> 01:00:20,307
Yeah.I saw him on the street,and he 
was asking me how things were going.

794
01:00:20,483 --> 01:00:21,916
It's a small town.

795
01:00:22,151 --> 01:00:25,314
Well, here's an idea. 
Don't do that.

796
01:00:25,722 --> 01:00:27,622
What happens here stays here.

797
01:00:28,558 --> 01:00:32,619
If it happens again,I'll have your badge
and gun in my drawer.Understood?

798
01:00:33,429 --> 01:00:35,420
- Understood.
- Thanks for the hat.

799
01:00:36,432 --> 01:00:37,956
You're welcome.

800
01:00:38,568 --> 01:00:39,830
Suit!

801
01:00:43,973 --> 01:00:47,500
Come on in. It's okay. 
You're not in trouble.

802
01:00:48,878 --> 01:00:52,370
-You practicing?
-Yes,I am.In a fight,front sight.

803
01:00:53,282 --> 01:00:55,045
Sit down.

804
01:00:55,118 --> 01:00:56,483
Jesse, can I ask you something?

805
01:00:56,552 --> 01:00:58,247
I was looking at this report.

806
01:00:58,321 --> 01:01:02,314
You arrested Joe Genest for 
assault and battery six months ago.

807
01:01:02,525 --> 01:01:04,459
- Yes, sir.
- Jesse.

808
01:01:04,894 --> 01:01:08,352
Jesse, Joe beat up this guy bad.

809
01:01:08,998 --> 01:01:11,296
Well, no charges were filed. Why?

810
01:01:11,534 --> 01:01:13,058
That's the way Lou wanted it.

811
01:01:13,136 --> 01:01:16,663
He said it was self-defense on Joe's 
part, which was a load of crap.

812
01:01:16,739 --> 01:01:19,037
Any idea why he might be
following me around?

813
01:01:19,108 --> 01:01:22,566
It might have something to do with
you kicking him in the nuts.

814
01:01:24,147 --> 01:01:26,741
I think he's plonking 
Hasty's wife.

815
01:01:26,816 --> 01:01:27,874
He is.

816
01:01:28,951 --> 01:01:30,543
How do you know?

817
01:01:32,288 --> 01:01:34,017
What do you know about 
Cissy Hathaway?

818
01:01:34,090 --> 01:01:36,183
- What do you mean?
- You know what I mean.

819
01:01:36,259 --> 01:01:39,751
- I don't know anything about that.
- Am I missing something here?

820
01:01:39,829 --> 01:01:44,266
I ask you about Cissy Hathaway,and you 
look like you just swallowed a squirrel.

821
01:01:46,002 --> 01:01:47,196
Suit...

822
01:01:48,771 --> 01:01:50,102
How do you know?

823
01:01:51,007 --> 01:01:54,204
I was plonking her
before Joe took my place.

824
01:02:11,961 --> 01:02:14,259
Did I hear you call 
Luther "Suitcase"?

825
01:02:14,464 --> 01:02:16,329
- You did.
- Why?

826
01:02:17,467 --> 01:02:18,764
Why not?

827
01:02:18,835 --> 01:02:21,326
Do you ever give anybody
a straight answer?

828
01:02:41,624 --> 01:02:44,491
- Change your mind about lunch?
- No.

829
01:02:44,560 --> 01:02:47,085
- We going to a different place?
- No.

830
01:02:47,163 --> 01:02:49,791
- Would you prefer I didn't ask?
- Yes.

831
01:03:10,853 --> 01:03:12,684
- Can I ask you a question?
- Yes.

832
01:03:12,755 --> 01:03:14,746
Why you following Joe Genest?

833
01:03:15,158 --> 01:03:16,716
Coply intuition.

834
01:03:17,927 --> 01:03:19,326
What's he doing?

835
01:03:19,395 --> 01:03:20,828
I don't know.

836
01:03:21,764 --> 01:03:24,892
- Can I ask you a question?
- Yes.

837
01:03:25,067 --> 01:03:27,934
-What do you think's in the bag?
-Money.

838
01:03:28,838 --> 01:03:31,966
-That's good police work, Officer Crane.
-Thank you.

839
01:03:38,014 --> 01:03:41,040
Assuming you're right about the bag
and it's not full of clothes,

840
01:03:41,117 --> 01:03:43,483
I think our friend 
is laundering money.

841
01:03:44,654 --> 01:03:46,849
So why is Hasty a son of a bitch?

842
01:03:48,591 --> 01:03:51,059
Lou didn't retire. 
Hasty forced him out.

843
01:03:51,694 --> 01:03:52,820
Why?

844
01:03:52,895 --> 01:03:54,123
I don't know.

845
01:03:54,864 --> 01:03:56,229
Can you guess?

846
01:03:58,100 --> 01:03:59,931
I don't want to.

847
01:04:01,571 --> 01:04:05,098
I think Joe Genest killed Lou
and made it look like an accident.

848
01:04:05,441 --> 01:04:07,238
Because Lou knew about this?

849
01:04:08,778 --> 01:04:10,405
That would be a motive.

850
01:04:12,782 --> 01:04:17,776
Unless Lou Carson's car could go 
sideways,it wasn't an accident.

851
01:04:19,555 --> 01:04:21,921
It was smashed in 
on the passenger side.

852
01:04:22,225 --> 01:04:24,955
So obviously not a suicide 
drive off the cliff.

853
01:04:25,094 --> 01:04:27,494
Traffic found
an abandoned rental truck in town.

854
01:04:27,563 --> 01:04:31,624
Traces of paint on the front bumper
matched the paint on Lou Carson's car.

855
01:04:32,101 --> 01:04:35,468
Rented under a phony name.
Driver's license didn't check out.

856
01:04:35,738 --> 01:04:40,835
Anyway, we did pick up enough at 
the scene to know he was pushed off.

857
01:04:41,544 --> 01:04:43,273
His motor wasn't running.

858
01:04:44,780 --> 01:04:46,304
You getting all this?

859
01:04:47,316 --> 01:04:48,874
You got a suspect?

860
01:04:49,585 --> 01:04:50,882
Not yet.

861
01:04:50,953 --> 01:04:54,980
-How about you?
-I got a prospect.Guy named Joe Genest.

862
01:04:56,292 --> 01:04:58,192
I know a guy named Joe Genest.

863
01:04:58,261 --> 01:05:02,527
Bag man for Gino Fish, who is 
a very prosperous businessman.

864
01:05:03,633 --> 01:05:05,362
Drugs and gambling mostly.

865
01:05:06,235 --> 01:05:10,035
He runs the South End and 
the Back Bay. Why Joe Genest?

866
01:05:10,606 --> 01:05:12,198
He's following me around.

867
01:05:12,275 --> 01:05:14,004
And why would he do that?

868
01:05:14,076 --> 01:05:15,805
'Cause he doesn't like me.

869
01:05:17,280 --> 01:05:18,611
Jesse,

870
01:05:19,181 --> 01:05:22,378
we've had Joe Genest
as a person of interest

871
01:05:22,451 --> 01:05:25,545
in about five mob killings.

872
01:05:26,389 --> 01:05:28,152
We got nowhere.

873
01:05:29,058 --> 01:05:31,356
I'd be a little careful 
if I were you.

874
01:05:47,109 --> 01:05:49,577
- Where's Boomer?
- He's home.

875
01:05:52,615 --> 01:05:54,242
I got some furniture.

876
01:05:58,454 --> 01:06:01,548
Jesse, I think
that we're moving way too fast.

877
01:06:04,126 --> 01:06:06,060
I think that I need some time.

878
01:06:10,633 --> 01:06:12,225
I understand.

879
01:06:14,470 --> 01:06:16,028
I'm sorry.

880
01:06:54,944 --> 01:06:57,640
I got a surprise for you, Boomer.

881
01:06:59,015 --> 01:07:00,607
Steak.

882
01:07:24,573 --> 01:07:28,031
<i>Hi. It's me. Call me.</i>

883
01:07:42,058 --> 01:07:46,154
<i>So I'd be kind of like a hyphenate.
A pediatricianlmedical examiner.</i>

884
01:07:46,362 --> 01:07:48,227
Well, no offense, Doc,

885
01:07:48,297 --> 01:07:52,256
I didn't know you were a pediatrician.
How about just medical examiner?

886
01:07:52,468 --> 01:07:54,698
I haven't seen a cadaver 
since med school.

887
01:07:54,770 --> 01:07:58,297
And you'll probably never see one.
Hell, nothing ever happens here.

888
01:07:58,374 --> 01:08:02,208
I can get you an extra 500 bucks 
a month and a nice title.

889
01:08:02,478 --> 01:08:05,379
- Sounds like a challenge.
- There's one other thing.

890
01:08:06,615 --> 01:08:09,243
I want you to put down my dog.

891
01:08:09,318 --> 01:08:10,546
Excuse me?

892
01:08:10,619 --> 01:08:12,849
I want you to put down my dog.

893
01:08:13,656 --> 01:08:15,283
Jesse, I can't do that.

894
01:08:16,292 --> 01:08:19,318
For me to euthanize your dog
would be completely unethical.

895
01:08:19,395 --> 01:08:20,453
Why?

896
01:08:20,529 --> 01:08:23,327
'Cause as a doctor,
I took an oath to do no harm.

897
01:08:24,600 --> 01:08:27,262
I'm a people doctor, 
not an animal doctor.

898
01:08:27,470 --> 01:08:28,767
Why don't you have the vet do it?

899
01:08:28,838 --> 01:08:30,738
Because I don't like her.

900
01:08:33,175 --> 01:08:35,803
Look, if you could get 
your mind around it,

901
01:08:36,846 --> 01:08:38,677
I'd consider it a favor.

902
01:08:44,753 --> 01:08:47,313
- Hey, Suit.
- Hi.

903
01:08:49,024 --> 01:08:50,924
- You got a second?
- Sure.

904
01:08:53,529 --> 01:08:55,053
Where's Boomer?

905
01:08:55,664 --> 01:08:57,029
He's home.

906
01:08:58,734 --> 01:09:00,326
Jesse, I got a problem.

907
01:09:00,402 --> 01:09:02,233
I don't care about Cissy Hathaway.

908
01:09:02,304 --> 01:09:03,703
No, it's not that.

909
01:09:03,772 --> 01:09:05,865
Something's been bothering me.

910
01:09:05,941 --> 01:09:08,535
I wasn't sure if I was 
supposed to ask and...

911
01:09:10,179 --> 01:09:13,478
Maybe I'm supposed to know.
See, the thing is...

912
01:09:13,549 --> 01:09:15,983
Why do you call me "Suitcase"?

913
01:09:16,051 --> 01:09:17,177
Why not?

914
01:09:17,253 --> 01:09:19,585
That's not funny, Jesse.

915
01:09:19,655 --> 01:09:20,952
I'm sorry.

916
01:09:21,023 --> 01:09:23,321
It's after Harry "Suitcase" Simpson.

917
01:09:23,425 --> 01:09:25,620
- The baseball player.
- Why "Suitcase"?

918
01:09:25,828 --> 01:09:28,820
Because he was traded to a lot 
of teams. He traveled a lot.

919
01:09:28,898 --> 01:09:30,923
But I've lived here all my life.

920
01:09:31,467 --> 01:09:33,765
Yeah, I know. Just seemed to fit.

921
01:10:08,671 --> 01:10:10,366
How long you had him?

922
01:10:11,373 --> 01:10:13,136
Since he was a pup.

923
01:10:36,432 --> 01:10:38,297
I went on the Internet.

924
01:10:41,637 --> 01:10:43,468
Found out how to do this.

925
01:10:46,842 --> 01:10:49,640
You can find out nearly anything
on the Internet.

926
01:11:33,255 --> 01:11:34,950
I'm sorry, Jesse.

927
01:11:36,225 --> 01:11:37,692
Thank you, Doc.

928
01:12:22,905 --> 01:12:27,342
<i>Hi, Jesse. Doc Perkins 
just told me about Boomer.</i>

929
01:12:28,310 --> 01:12:29,937
<i>Call me when you can.</i>

930
01:13:07,683 --> 01:13:09,810
I guess Lou was on the take.

931
01:13:11,687 --> 01:13:13,086
I think so.

932
01:13:13,155 --> 01:13:15,055
You know, last night I was thinking.

933
01:13:15,124 --> 01:13:18,491
About a year ago, Hasty kept coming
in and out of here as he pleased.

934
01:13:18,560 --> 01:13:22,394
He used Lou's office...
Sorry, your office.

935
01:13:23,732 --> 01:13:26,929
Hasty's white-collar. Doesn't 
figure he'd order a murder.

936
01:13:27,669 --> 01:13:30,137
Can you prove that 
Joe Genest killed him?

937
01:13:31,340 --> 01:13:33,831
I got some evidence, but no proof.

938
01:13:39,415 --> 01:13:41,349
This happened on my watch.

939
01:13:45,788 --> 01:13:47,722
I gotta make something happen.

940
01:13:52,294 --> 01:13:53,818
Where's Boomer?

941
01:13:57,633 --> 01:13:58,861
He's home.

942
01:14:40,976 --> 01:14:43,240
- You got a cigarette?
- No.

943
01:14:43,745 --> 01:14:45,645
- What, you don't smoke?
- No.

944
01:14:46,415 --> 01:14:48,815
- You ever?
- No.

945
01:14:49,351 --> 01:14:51,251
- How come?
- I was a jock.

946
01:14:51,553 --> 01:14:53,714
I didn't want it 
to affect my wind.

947
01:14:54,056 --> 01:14:55,683
So, what are you doing here?

948
01:14:55,757 --> 01:14:57,349
I was waiting for you.

949
01:14:58,060 --> 01:14:59,584
I talked to your mom.

950
01:15:00,195 --> 01:15:01,787
She worries about you.

951
01:15:02,965 --> 01:15:06,298
She said you took the divorce really 
hard, that you hate your dad.

952
01:15:06,368 --> 01:15:07,801
Well, I do.

953
01:15:07,870 --> 01:15:09,428
Well, that's too bad.

954
01:15:09,505 --> 01:15:12,269
-Fathers are important.
-Look, I don't want another lecture.

955
01:15:12,341 --> 01:15:14,468
I'm not lecturing. I'm sharing.

956
01:15:14,843 --> 01:15:17,778
- We have something in common.
- You hate your dad?

957
01:15:18,780 --> 01:15:21,476
No. But I've been through a divorce.

958
01:15:22,150 --> 01:15:26,177
- You hate your ex-wife?
- Sometimes. But not all the time.

959
01:15:26,255 --> 01:15:31,659
And I'm a better person when
I remember that I care about her.

960
01:15:33,595 --> 01:15:35,790
Your dad's done some bad things.

961
01:15:36,732 --> 01:15:38,222
Tell me about it.

962
01:15:41,003 --> 01:15:42,527
To other people, too.

963
01:15:46,141 --> 01:15:49,599
If something happens 
and you need to talk,

964
01:15:51,046 --> 01:15:52,980
let me know.

965
01:15:55,050 --> 01:15:56,517
I'll meet you here.

966
01:16:09,731 --> 01:16:11,995
You gotta watch 
that drinking thing.

967
01:16:12,901 --> 01:16:16,234
Oh, hey there, Chief,
you following me?

968
01:16:17,406 --> 01:16:18,771
I asked you first.

969
01:16:20,609 --> 01:16:22,201
So, how's Hasty's wife?

970
01:16:25,213 --> 01:16:26,305
Excuse me?

971
01:16:26,815 --> 01:16:28,612
What do you do, Joe?

972
01:16:30,786 --> 01:16:34,449
Guy drives a nice car, pays cash 
for his house. I get curious.

973
01:16:34,957 --> 01:16:37,050
Maybe you should stay that way.

974
01:16:38,827 --> 01:16:41,022
You've done some bad things, Joe.

975
01:16:41,296 --> 01:16:44,026
So throw me in jail.

976
01:16:44,166 --> 01:16:45,565
Not tonight.

977
01:16:47,869 --> 01:16:50,497
When's the last time you had sex
with a woman?

978
01:16:53,542 --> 01:16:55,476
None of your business.

979
01:16:55,577 --> 01:16:57,943
Well, I think you should consider it.

980
01:16:58,347 --> 01:17:00,747
'Cause it's going to 
be the last time.

981
01:17:39,588 --> 01:17:41,715
- Hello.
- Hi, Hasty.

982
01:17:41,790 --> 01:17:45,191
Sorry to bother you in the middle
of the night, but you said anytime.

983
01:17:45,260 --> 01:17:47,854
<i>Listen, something's come up.
We have to talk.</i>

984
01:17:47,929 --> 01:17:50,124
- What's going on?
- Can it wait till morning?

985
01:17:50,198 --> 01:17:52,132
- If you say so, boss.
- What's going on?

986
01:17:52,200 --> 01:17:53,997
Right. I'll call you first 
thing in the morning.

987
01:17:54,069 --> 01:17:55,058
<i>Fine.</i>

988
01:18:35,310 --> 01:18:37,471
The son of a bitch has landed.

989
01:18:41,917 --> 01:18:45,318
-I thought you were gonna call me.
-Well, you said it was urgent.

990
01:18:45,387 --> 01:18:47,412
I'm sorry, boss, you said anytime.

991
01:18:47,489 --> 01:18:49,320
- What's going on?
- Want some coffee?

992
01:18:49,391 --> 01:18:51,416
Coffee? No, I don't want coffee.

993
01:18:55,430 --> 01:18:57,261
Lou Carson was murdered.

994
01:18:58,400 --> 01:18:59,924
Murdered?

995
01:19:01,303 --> 01:19:03,897
Well, I find that 
hard to believe.

996
01:19:04,239 --> 01:19:07,333
You know what? I actually...
I will have some coffee.

997
01:19:09,611 --> 01:19:12,512
Molly, can we have another 
cup of coffee?

998
01:19:12,814 --> 01:19:14,907
- You told me it was a car accident.
- I was wrong.

999
01:19:14,983 --> 01:19:17,918
-Newspapers called it a car accident.
-That's what the police gave them.

1000
01:19:17,986 --> 01:19:20,853
-But you remember this guy Joe Genest?
-Joe Genest?

1001
01:19:23,391 --> 01:19:25,859
Molly, close the door.

1002
01:19:28,296 --> 01:19:31,129
- You think Joe Genest killed Lou?
- I know it.

1003
01:19:31,199 --> 01:19:34,100
- How do you know it?
- I can't tell you.

1004
01:19:36,204 --> 01:19:39,264
Look, Hasty,
I know I owe you a lot but this...

1005
01:19:42,744 --> 01:19:45,542
All right. All right.

1006
01:19:46,148 --> 01:19:48,173
But this has to stay between us.

1007
01:19:48,316 --> 01:19:49,874
Yeah, of course, I understand.

1008
01:19:49,951 --> 01:19:52,852
Well, Healey found evidence
that Joe was at the scene.

1009
01:19:53,121 --> 01:19:55,851
Oh, he found it. Why hasn't
 he arrested him, then?

1010
01:19:55,924 --> 01:19:59,325
Well,they don't have enough to make
a case.They don't have a motive yet but...

1011
01:19:59,394 --> 01:20:02,522
See, I think I do. J
oe works for the mob.

1012
01:20:02,597 --> 01:20:05,998
And I think he and Lou had some 
kind of deal that went bad.

1013
01:20:08,270 --> 01:20:09,999
There's something else.

1014
01:20:12,174 --> 01:20:14,404
Joe's sleeping with your wife.

1015
01:20:17,746 --> 01:20:21,182
I think if he's arrested, 
it's gonna come out.

1016
01:20:24,286 --> 01:20:26,379
No one else knows about this.

1017
01:20:28,089 --> 01:20:31,684
I appreciate that you came
to me first with this.

1018
01:20:31,760 --> 01:20:34,456
I'm sorry to be the one 
to have to tell you.

1019
01:20:37,399 --> 01:20:40,129
- I'll walk you out.
- Yeah.

1020
01:21:39,494 --> 01:21:40,756
I got it.

1021
01:21:46,334 --> 01:21:48,802
- Hello.
- Jesse, this is Hasty. Listen.

1022
01:21:48,870 --> 01:21:51,930
This thing has really thrown me 
for a loop,and I need to talk.

1023
01:21:52,007 --> 01:21:54,202
I understand. I'll come 
to you, boss.

1024
01:21:54,276 --> 01:21:56,267
No, no. It's got to be 
somewhere private.

1025
01:21:56,344 --> 01:21:58,608
I don't want everybody 
to know about this.

1026
01:21:58,680 --> 01:22:00,944
<i>You know where that 
rusted ship is tied up?</i>

1027
01:22:01,016 --> 01:22:03,075
- Yes.
- Tonight, 8:00.

1028
01:22:03,184 --> 01:22:05,584
- I'll be there.
- Good. Thanks.

1029
01:22:11,326 --> 01:22:13,294
He'll be there.

1030
01:22:13,962 --> 01:22:16,954
You got to talk to him in private
about what?

1031
01:22:20,302 --> 01:22:23,169
Anything you want to say
to me there, Hasty?

1032
01:22:24,839 --> 01:22:29,105
I don't think there is anything I could 
say that'll make a difference,will it?

1033
01:23:33,341 --> 01:23:35,673
I work for the mob and I kill people.

1034
01:23:35,744 --> 01:23:37,041
Excuse me?

1035
01:23:37,712 --> 01:23:40,237
You asked what I do for a living.

1036
01:23:41,850 --> 01:23:43,784
Give me your gun.

1037
01:23:44,452 --> 01:23:45,783
No.

1038
01:23:47,822 --> 01:23:50,188
Put your hands behind your head.

1039
01:23:50,258 --> 01:23:51,555
No.

1040
01:23:52,327 --> 01:23:53,419
Excuse me?

1041
01:23:54,262 --> 01:23:57,629
I'm not putting my hands behind
 my head. I'm drinking coffee.

1042
01:23:58,233 --> 01:24:00,030
And you're gonna 
shoot me anyway.

1043
01:24:00,101 --> 01:24:02,126
That's a good point.

1044
01:24:17,786 --> 01:24:19,583
Is he dead?

1045
01:24:19,654 --> 01:24:20,678
Yeah.

1046
01:24:20,755 --> 01:24:22,188
How do you know?

1047
01:24:23,525 --> 01:24:24,787
You just know.

1048
01:24:31,499 --> 01:24:35,663
Tragically, Joe's ambitions
exceeded his abilities.

1049
01:24:36,037 --> 01:24:38,733
And it's one way
to keep him away from my wife.

1050
01:24:39,674 --> 01:24:41,369
You all right?

1051
01:24:41,743 --> 01:24:43,574
Too soon to tell.

1052
01:24:51,286 --> 01:24:52,617
Oh, Hasty.

1053
01:24:53,855 --> 01:24:55,220
Yeah, I know.

1054
01:24:56,091 --> 01:24:59,720
I was growing really fond of you,too.
I'm sorry to put you through this.

1055
01:24:59,794 --> 01:25:02,319
This? This is nothing.

1056
01:25:02,530 --> 01:25:04,589
I just had to bury my dog.

1057
01:25:05,767 --> 01:25:08,258
What'd you do, Hasty? 
See this in a movie?

1058
01:25:08,536 --> 01:25:12,063
You shoot Joe with the Chief's gun.
And then you use his on me.

1059
01:25:12,707 --> 01:25:14,038
Pretty much.

1060
01:25:14,109 --> 01:25:19,513
Well, the problem is you might have trouble
explaining why Joe was shot in the back.

1061
01:25:24,052 --> 01:25:25,144
Oh, right.

1062
01:25:25,253 --> 01:25:27,983
You're out of your league, Hasty.
Don't do this.

1063
01:25:28,923 --> 01:25:30,914
I don't wanna see you get hurt.

1064
01:25:31,993 --> 01:25:33,722
I'm the one with the gun.

1065
01:25:33,895 --> 01:25:35,362
Not the only one.

1066
01:25:35,964 --> 01:25:37,795
Don't move a muscle, Hasty.

1067
01:25:44,205 --> 01:25:46,867
Oh, hell. No.

1068
01:25:48,743 --> 01:25:50,301
Just put it down.

1069
01:25:53,548 --> 01:25:54,981
<i>Did you get all that, Molly?</i>

1070
01:25:55,049 --> 01:25:57,711
Tell the son of a bitch we got it all.

1071
01:26:05,260 --> 01:26:07,694
There's another one in his pocket.

1072
01:26:11,966 --> 01:26:13,729
I was ready, Jesse.

1073
01:26:14,269 --> 01:26:16,237
Sure you were, Suitcase.

1074
01:26:36,191 --> 01:26:37,783
Good God.

1075
01:26:44,599 --> 01:26:46,999
You should've done 
something to stop it.
