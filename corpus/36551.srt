00:01:07,167 --> 00:01:08,600
Hello, ladies.

2
00:01:09,869 --> 00:01:13,464
This is all kind of funny,
really.

3
00:01:13,973 --> 00:01:18,603
Actually thiswhole thingstarted
because of laughter, you know.

4
00:01:18,878 --> 00:01:22,006
Laughter, when thesmile
has an orgasm?

5
00:01:22,348 --> 00:01:25,283
And out of 100% of youwomen...

6
00:01:25,485 --> 00:01:28,477
I can bring99% of you
to this climax chuckle.

7
00:01:29,222 --> 00:01:30,951
I can.

8
00:01:31,724 --> 00:01:37,924
But I can't make the one girl I love
smile likeshe made mesmile...

9
00:01:38,131 --> 00:01:42,090
on theworst day of my already
terrible laughable life.

10
00:01:42,535 --> 00:01:46,801
Which isquite a fee considering
l ve been having horrible days...

11
00:01:47,073 --> 00:01:49,064
ever since lwas akid.

12
00:02:15,935 --> 00:02:18,096
I'msorry! I'msorry!

13
00:02:48,701 --> 00:02:52,967
Don't move!Your tongue
hasstuck to my clit ring! God!

14
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:56,404
Don't move! Don't!
Don't move!

15
00:03:11,157 --> 00:03:14,558
This drawing is... appalling!

16
00:03:14,761 --> 00:03:18,959
Youshow absolutely no understanding
of thiswoman or any woman!

17
00:03:19,465 --> 00:03:24,664
In the future the only drawingyou'll
be doing is drawing unemployment.

18
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:29,308
You have to listen to me!We are over,
we are completely and totally over!

19
00:03:29,742 --> 00:03:33,075
You break upwith me, youwanna
do it before I give you aride home.

20
00:03:33,279 --> 00:03:39,047
- Sorry, we are over.
- No!You can't do this to me now!

21
00:03:39,285 --> 00:03:43,619
Please, Gretchen, not now!Today
is already theworst day of my life!

22
00:04:22,128 --> 00:04:25,325
I believe you lost your smile?

23
00:04:28,534 --> 00:04:31,094
You lost your smile.

24
00:04:34,474 --> 00:04:37,034
her name was hope.

25
00:04:39,545 --> 00:04:44,141
She hadthiswinningsmile
that couldtake Olympic gold.

26
00:04:52,558 --> 00:04:54,583
I've had alot of bad days
in my life.

27
00:04:54,794 --> 00:04:57,592
Today definitely qualifies
as theworst.

28
00:04:57,830 --> 00:04:59,661
Things could beworse.

29
00:04:59,866 --> 00:05:03,563
At least Gretchen broke upwith you
before you got you penis pierced.

30
00:05:03,936 --> 00:05:08,771
Yousee? Your funny ha- ha
is just sort of accidentally funny.

31
00:05:09,008 --> 00:05:10,566
Accidentally funny?

32
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:13,537
See, I'm always doingweird
stuff and I don't even know it.

33
00:05:13,746 --> 00:05:17,182
Just happens. And thus,
I'm accidentally funny.

34
00:05:17,383 --> 00:05:19,943
Sam, nobody is normal all the time.

35
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:24,249
Look at me. ljust noticed I've had
my shirt on inside out all day.

36
00:05:42,075 --> 00:05:45,772
Yeah, but you know, I'm not
even normalsome of the time.

37
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:50,005
Yousee?Wouldyou look at this?
Case in point, right?

38
00:05:50,216 --> 00:05:53,014
I have a f akewallet to keep in my
pants pocket in case I get mugged.

39
00:05:53,219 --> 00:05:55,346
I keep my real money
crumpled up inside my sock.

40
00:05:55,955 --> 00:06:00,449
This is odd? You know anyone else
in the entireworld that does this?

41
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:02,423
- 0ne other.
- Who?

42
00:06:02,795 --> 00:06:05,457
Me. That's areally good idea.

43
00:06:05,665 --> 00:06:08,759
Great. Now I'm contagious.

44
00:06:09,569 --> 00:06:13,471
Sam, what made you enroll
on anArt School?

45
00:06:13,806 --> 00:06:17,572
Isort of determined that all artists
areweird, so if I became one...

46
00:06:17,777 --> 00:06:20,575
that I'd have an excuse
for my chronicstrangeness.

47
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:24,147
You cansee now why today
is my personalWaterloo.

48
00:06:24,784 --> 00:06:28,811
In less than an hour I've not only
found out I have no talent...

49
00:06:29,021 --> 00:06:31,114
no future, no girlfriend...

50
00:06:31,324 --> 00:06:36,284
but now I also have absolutely
no excuses for my eccentricities.

51
00:06:36,496 --> 00:06:40,091
- What can I do to cheer you up?
- Nothing. There's nothingyou can do.

52
00:06:40,299 --> 00:06:43,632
Maybe I couldstart by cleaning
this"snew" off your shirt.

53
00:06:44,537 --> 00:06:47,700
"Snew"?What's"snew"?

54
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:50,137
I don't now. What's new with you?

55
00:06:51,778 --> 00:06:55,578
What did SnowWhite say to Pinocchio
whenshe wassittingon his f ace?

56
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:59,017
"Lie to me! Lie to me!"

57
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:04,250
Hey, let's make like ababy
and head out.

58
00:07:07,326 --> 00:07:09,226
Let's go.

59
00:07:11,731 --> 00:07:14,063
- You know what I think weshould do?
- No.

60
00:07:18,805 --> 00:07:21,467
Whichwindow didyousay
was your ex- girlfriend's?

61
00:07:21,674 --> 00:07:23,505
I think it was that one.

62
00:07:25,244 --> 00:07:28,441
You bastard! I'm gonna come down
there and cut your balls off!

63
00:07:28,648 --> 00:07:31,674
Then I'm gonnashove them in your
mouth and make you eat them!

64
00:07:31,884 --> 00:07:35,251
If laughter is asmilingorgasm,
let me tellyou...

65
00:07:35,755 --> 00:07:40,658
we had alaughter that was multiple,
simultaneous andwet.

66
00:07:41,494 --> 00:07:43,462
- My number is555...

67
00:07:43,663 --> 00:07:47,258

68
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:48,789
0kay, great.

69
00:07:49,735 --> 00:07:52,636
Don't forget this. Your smile.

70
00:07:53,539 --> 00:07:57,168
And thank you
for giving it back to me.

71
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:27,098
- That's my ride.
- 0kay.

72
00:08:28,307 --> 00:08:30,707
- Call me.
- Yeah, lwill.

73
00:08:48,227 --> 00:08:52,163
I hadto find hope.
So ltook a job as adelivery guy.

74
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:53,627
Here's your order.

75
00:08:53,833 --> 00:08:56,233
hope probably would've called me
acuisine career.

76
00:08:56,435 --> 00:08:57,697
Here's your...

77
00:08:59,972 --> 00:09:01,599
It's lame, I know...

78
00:09:01,807 --> 00:09:05,402
but at least the job allowed me
to search for hope onevery corner...

79
00:09:05,611 --> 00:09:09,274
inevery building, inevery run
I made throughout the city.

80
00:09:12,318 --> 00:09:16,618
0h my God! I'msosorry!
I'm gonnapull out. I mean, back out.

81
00:09:30,036 --> 00:09:31,970
Women? Please follow me thisway.

82
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:38,238
The Women's Residence and Club
has been in existencesince 193.

83
00:09:38,444 --> 00:09:41,971
We havewomen from all50 States
aswell as Puerto Rico and Guam...

84
00:09:42,181 --> 00:09:43,910
and0 other countries.

85
00:09:44,116 --> 00:09:49,418
We have two 0lympicsizeswimming
pools aswell as four tennis courts.

86
00:09:56,996 --> 00:09:58,429
Excuse me?

87
00:09:58,831 --> 00:10:01,629
Hi. Do you know where6D is?

88
00:10:05,204 --> 00:10:06,535
Thanks.

89
00:10:11,978 --> 00:10:13,445
Delivery!

90
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:20,782
Hope! Hey!

91
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:22,680
Hello, Sam.

92
00:10:22,888 --> 00:10:25,379
0h my God! I've been looking for you
everywhere. You have no idea.

93
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:28,423
I'mso, sosorry I never calledyou.

94
00:10:28,661 --> 00:10:30,788
Because youwrote your number
down on my palm...

95
00:10:30,997 --> 00:10:33,522
and therewas pouring rain
that night and it washed up.

96
00:10:33,733 --> 00:10:35,030
It's okay.

97
00:10:35,735 --> 00:10:37,225
How are you?

98
00:10:37,436 --> 00:10:39,996
You look likesomeone dropped
anACMEsafe on your head.

99
00:10:40,206 --> 00:10:41,696
Fine.

100
00:10:42,675 --> 00:10:44,165
Me too. I'm fine too.

101
00:10:46,946 --> 00:10:48,607
This is awkward.

102
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:51,476
Times like this I think about dogs.

103
00:10:51,851 --> 00:10:52,840
Dogs?

104
00:10:54,453 --> 00:10:58,048
I like theway they lick your f ace
and let you pet them all over.

105
00:10:58,324 --> 00:11:02,158
It'd be nice if womencould
let you know you're liked...

106
00:11:02,361 --> 00:11:04,693
theway that a dog lets you know.

107
00:11:07,266 --> 00:11:09,097
Nice ice- breaker.

108
00:11:09,568 --> 00:11:10,762
Maybe.

109
00:11:12,038 --> 00:11:15,405
- You ordered this?
- Thanks. They sent the extrasauce.

110
00:11:23,416 --> 00:11:26,476
- I think all I have is a $50.
- Yeah, that's okay.

111
00:11:27,386 --> 00:11:29,513
I think I can break that.

112
00:11:33,459 --> 00:11:36,360
I think I'm making ahabit
out of this.

113
00:11:36,962 --> 00:11:38,987
Are yousure you're alright?

114
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:42,326
- Yeah, never better.
- Cause you don't look never better.

115
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:46,335
- You'rewrong. I'm fine.
- I thought lwaswrong once...

116
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:49,201
but lwas mistaken.
And I'm not wrong here.

117
00:11:49,408 --> 00:11:51,137
Come on, what's the matter?

118
00:11:51,343 --> 00:11:54,312
Nothing that anice meal
couldn't take care of.

119
00:11:56,916 --> 00:11:58,747
Goodbye, Sam.

120
00:12:16,802 --> 00:12:19,293
- Where's Holden?
- He's in the back.

121
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:23,938
I'll butter up your sweat, baby!

122
00:12:24,143 --> 00:12:27,704
You got such a tight ass!
What's that?

123
00:12:27,913 --> 00:12:30,347
Squeeze it harder, huh?

124
00:12:32,351 --> 00:12:33,841
What the hell are you doing?

125
00:12:34,353 --> 00:12:35,911
Hey, man!

126
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:38,784
What's going on?

127
00:12:38,991 --> 00:12:41,789
Iwas rearranging my collection.

128
00:12:42,628 --> 00:12:44,152
It was totally inefficient.

129
00:12:44,363 --> 00:12:46,524
I had"double penetration"
filed under"double dildo".

130
00:12:46,732 --> 00:12:48,791
I don't care about
your Smithsoniansmut.

131
00:12:49,034 --> 00:12:50,899
Why was your hand on your ass?

132
00:12:51,103 --> 00:12:54,504
Sometimes I gotta get alittle kinky
to... jack up the oldwinky.

133
00:12:54,707 --> 00:12:58,268
See? Here. If Istare
at this centerfold here...

134
00:12:58,477 --> 00:13:02,436
and concentrate real hard
while grabbing my own butt...

135
00:13:02,648 --> 00:13:05,845
it feels like I'm feeling up
Miss September's ass!

136
00:13:06,685 --> 00:13:08,653
You know, uncle Bart
would be really pissed...

137
00:13:08,854 --> 00:13:10,913
if he came in and caught you
flickingyour grunge.

138
00:13:13,159 --> 00:13:16,788
I haven't seen you this cracky since
I gave you that Montezumaswindley.

139
00:13:17,563 --> 00:13:19,087
Come on.

140
00:13:20,266 --> 00:13:22,257
- Spillyour guts.
- No, I can't.

141
00:13:23,235 --> 00:13:25,703
Why?Why can't you tell me
what's going on?

142
00:13:25,905 --> 00:13:27,372
Holden, how can I talk to you?

143
00:13:27,573 --> 00:13:30,599
You're one of those guyswho have
a tray that makes boob- shaped Jell- 0.

144
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:34,507
You once bought those underwear
to lift andseparate your butt.

145
00:13:34,747 --> 00:13:37,648
You've got arthritis
from jerking off too many times.

146
00:13:37,883 --> 00:13:39,908
I did not get arthritis!

147
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:43,613
It's"carpotonalsyndrome".

148
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:47,452
Holden!This gelatin boobs
are f antastic!

149
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:49,628
They 'resensitive, aren't they?

150
00:13:50,462 --> 00:13:51,861
You'reso tense!

151
00:13:52,064 --> 00:13:55,431
What you need is a day with my
two- dimensional lady friend here.

152
00:13:55,734 --> 00:13:58,032
She not only pulls out...

153
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:00,772
but she puts out.

154
00:14:01,273 --> 00:14:03,002
What do you think, Sam?

155
00:14:03,242 --> 00:14:07,110
Isn't the mass of the ass directly
proportional to the beauty of the cutie?

156
00:14:07,613 --> 00:14:10,173
- What?
- That is thespirit!

157
00:14:10,382 --> 00:14:13,545
Man, when you're down in the dump
you just gottalaugh it off!

158
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:16,012
You know what?

159
00:14:16,555 --> 00:14:18,819
That's actually a good idea.

160
00:14:19,959 --> 00:14:22,450
How many surrealists does it take
toscrew in alight bulb?

161
00:14:23,162 --> 00:14:24,595
A fish.

162
00:14:24,797 --> 00:14:27,391
Look at this article. It explains
how a few good endorphins...

163
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,465
can make yousmile.

164
00:14:34,473 --> 00:14:37,636
Conversely, alright, it says that
if you force asmile on your f ace...

165
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:41,074
you can trick your body into releasing
thesame feel- good endorphins...

166
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:42,941
which make you happy.

167
00:14:43,148 --> 00:14:46,242
Didyou know that if you change
the"i's" in Mississippi to"o's"...

168
00:14:46,452 --> 00:14:47,976

169
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:50,120
Come on, are those
endorphins pumping?

170
00:14:50,756 --> 00:14:52,690
Come on, that's great!

171
00:14:52,925 --> 00:14:54,222
Look at that f ace!

172
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:56,759

173
00:14:57,329 --> 00:14:59,661
I appreciate the effort...

is a great success.

175
00:15:04,236 --> 00:15:06,261
It's your audience
that's a total f ailure.

176
00:15:09,875 --> 00:15:12,139
I gotta get some new material.

177
00:15:28,494 --> 00:15:29,984
0h my God!

178
00:15:30,696 --> 00:15:32,186
I think I broke it.

179
00:15:32,865 --> 00:15:35,766
I think"busted" is amore
appropriate phrase.

180
00:15:36,168 --> 00:15:38,796
- Does it hurt?
- No, you didn't pop my boob...

181
00:15:39,004 --> 00:15:43,373

I'm Flat Chasted. I mean I'mAnnie.

182
00:15:43,742 --> 00:15:45,209
Hi, I'm Sam.

183
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:47,408
What's in a aquabra?

184
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:51,379
It's abrassiere that supplements
the figurewithwater implants.

185
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:53,149
See?

186
00:15:55,354 --> 00:15:57,584
There it is!

187
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:58,848
God!

188
00:15:59,058 --> 00:16:00,582
0kay. 0kay.

189
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:05,355
It's funny. I gottaremember
to tell my friend Hope about this.

190
00:16:05,564 --> 00:16:07,623
Hope on the top floor?

191
00:16:09,335 --> 00:16:11,428
She doesn't think
anything's funny.

192
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:14,470
What gave her such amood dunk?
I mean isshe always like this?

193
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:17,631
No, at first shewas pretty happy.

194
00:16:17,843 --> 00:16:18,832
I catch you later.

195
00:16:19,044 --> 00:16:22,275
One day hope came home
and something happened.

196
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:23,607
I haven't seen her
out of her roomsince...

197
00:16:23,882 --> 00:16:27,682

the hospital, so I don't see anyone.

198
00:16:28,454 --> 00:16:30,479
- It was nice meetingyou.
- Yeah, you too.

199
00:16:33,292 --> 00:16:34,816
Do you know Hope in6D?

200
00:16:35,194 --> 00:16:39,893
My acting coach told me no to talk to
anyonewhile I'm doing my exercises.

201
00:16:42,034 --> 00:16:44,229
Excuse me, miss, do you know...?

202
00:16:45,037 --> 00:16:49,098

Well I refuse! lwon't be your slave

218
00:17:57,076 --> 00:18:01,809
I'm not turned on by your
executrix power suit, your war armor!

219
00:18:01,947 --> 00:18:05,678
Your mini- skirt loin cloth

224
00:18:30,909 --> 00:18:32,706
Here's your coffee, Tanya.

225
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:46,891
0h, and by theway,
I'm not the Amazon princess.

226
00:18:47,092 --> 00:18:48,957
I'm the Amazon queen.

227
00:18:57,402 --> 00:19:01,065
- What are all these balloons for?
- Some kid's birthday party.

228
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:04,775
- So, how's your probe going?
- Probe?

229
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:09,539
0h, the investigation. It's terrible.
Some of these girls can be really mean.

230
00:19:09,748 --> 00:19:13,479
There's this one girl, Tanya,
she treats me like a total pee- on.

231
00:19:13,685 --> 00:19:17,018
Pee- on? I didn't know
you're intowatching.

232
00:19:17,422 --> 00:19:19,583
No, not like that.

233
00:19:20,792 --> 00:19:24,922
God, Holden! Do you ever think
about anything other thansex?

234
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:29,464
Isaid forget about Hope and move on
tosomeonewho's more probable!

235
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:32,000
No, it's not gonnahappen.
I'm not giving up on her.

236
00:19:32,271 --> 00:19:35,502
Come on, man!
Wake up andsmell the pussy!

237
00:19:35,707 --> 00:19:39,803
You are totally in lovewith her.
You think that if you find her smile...

238
00:19:40,045 --> 00:19:43,139
that she'll end up f alling in love
with likesome f airy tale!

239
00:19:43,615 --> 00:19:46,482
But more likely she'll end up
screwingyou over...

240
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:49,279
andyou'll end up taking it
in the tail!

241
00:19:51,056 --> 00:19:55,857
0kay, alright. I do love her.
But I'm also her friend.

242
00:19:56,094 --> 00:19:58,585
Look man, something terrible
happened to her in that building.

243
00:19:58,797 --> 00:20:02,563
I'm gonna find out what that was and
maybe I can make things right again.

244
00:20:02,801 --> 00:20:07,295
Easy on those balloons, you don't want
to disappoint the birthday... boy.

245
00:20:07,673 --> 00:20:11,336

00:21:16,174 --> 00:21:20,668
Yeah, thesame thing could besaid

264
00:21:20,879 --> 00:21:25,942

265
00:21:26,218 --> 00:21:30,621
- Why, thank you, Captain 0bvious.

266
00:21:31,223 --> 00:21:36,661
It's Willens. And I manage this place.
And I don't like yousnooping around.

267
00:21:37,229 --> 00:21:40,630
If Isee you around here again,
I'm gonnamakesure I call the...

268
00:21:40,932 --> 00:21:43,423
Hey!You almost hit mewith that.

269
00:21:44,536 --> 00:21:47,266
How wouldyou like it
if I loaded one up?

270
00:21:49,174 --> 00:21:53,110
Go ahead. Make my day.

271
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:56,277
You gottabe joking.

272
00:21:56,615 --> 00:22:02,212
Iwas just clearing my nasal passages.
Youwere the one making a thing of it.

273
00:22:02,421 --> 00:22:06,380
Alright. Now don't go doing
anything rash.

274
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:11,691
Take your fingers off the nostril.

275
00:22:12,431 --> 00:22:14,422
You first.

276
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:17,161
Same time.

277
00:23:10,389 --> 00:23:12,152
Eat it, Willens.

278
00:23:15,293 --> 00:23:18,319
Go ahead, pull the trigger.

279
00:23:19,598 --> 00:23:22,692
- Pull on this.
- Get lost, ass!

280
00:23:26,471 --> 00:23:30,635
The only thing I'd figured out iswhy
detective issometimes called a"dick".

281
00:23:31,176 --> 00:23:33,872
Cause that'sexactly
what l dfound out.

282
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:38,911
Iwasn't good investigating
the mystery of hope.

283
00:23:39,117 --> 00:23:42,086
I hadto find anew strategy.

284
00:23:42,521 --> 00:23:44,751
Sam!The rent is due.

285
00:23:51,062 --> 00:23:53,724

292
00:24:43,849 --> 00:24:47,808

- Give me asec, okay?
- Yeah, sure.

295
00:25:04,503 --> 00:25:08,132
So, do you think that Hope is cute?

296
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:10,365
Yes, she'ssuch a fox.

297
00:25:10,609 --> 00:25:13,669

And get your hands off of her.

298

muscles on my f aceso I look thinner.

334
00:27:30,281 --> 00:27:32,249
0f course it is.

335
00:27:32,651 --> 00:27:38,590
I think this piece goes there
and this piece goes here...

336
00:27:39,858 --> 00:27:42,224
You'restill missingsome pieces.

337
00:27:43,194 --> 00:27:47,460
Why don't you draw the missing parts?
Youwent to the Art Institute, right?

338
00:27:47,866 --> 00:27:51,427
I never finished. Iwasso bad
they made me turn in my beret.

339
00:27:52,003 --> 00:27:54,767
The RoyalAcademy of Velvet Painters
won't accept me.

340
00:27:54,973 --> 00:27:57,942
I can't even get my work shown
in the Museum of Stick Figure Art.

341
00:27:58,143 --> 00:28:00,509
Who cares? The curators of that
Museum havesticks up their butt.

342
00:28:00,712 --> 00:28:05,172
Velvet painting diedwith Elvis.
Berets? They 're not even real hats.

343
00:28:05,383 --> 00:28:07,783
You know, I've always thought that.
I mean it's got no brim.

344
00:28:07,986 --> 00:28:09,749
Doesn't cover your ears.

345
00:28:09,954 --> 00:28:13,219
It's not ahat, it's a goddamn cap!
That'swhat it is.

346
00:28:16,294 --> 00:28:19,024
Why do you have apen
attached to your hip?

347
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:21,824
Because I am the f astest draw
on the West.

348
00:28:22,033 --> 00:28:23,557
Really?

349
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:28,635
I had abit of amishap in my prom. I
don't put pens in my pockets anymore.

350
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:30,432
It's abit of alongstory.

351
00:28:30,875 --> 00:28:33,844
You ever think how f ar
an artist hand has traveled?

352
00:28:34,045 --> 00:28:37,412
Look at yourself sketching.
Your fingers are in constant motion.

353
00:28:37,615 --> 00:28:39,879
Every time youshade the pen moves
a couple inches asecond...

354
00:28:40,085 --> 00:28:41,677
that's gotta add up.

355
00:28:41,886 --> 00:28:46,084
This hand has traveled long distances.
Specially in theshower.

356
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:53,293
Seriously. Do you know what my
f avorite part of being an artist is?

357
00:28:53,598 --> 00:28:56,465
It's the most honest profession
in theworld.

358
00:28:56,935 --> 00:28:58,800
How's that?

359
00:28:59,270 --> 00:29:02,535
You can pretty much f ake being good
in any other profession.

360
00:29:02,741 --> 00:29:06,768
but, as an artist, either your
drawing is good or it's bad.

361
00:29:08,246 --> 00:29:11,113
Artists just have to lay
everything on the line.

362
00:29:11,816 --> 00:29:13,477
Literally.

363
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:19,020
Wait asecond.
I'veseen thissomewhere before.

364
00:29:19,424 --> 00:29:21,255
Here's the album
youwanted to borrow.

365
00:29:21,459 --> 00:29:24,326
It took me along time to find it,
I never listen to them anymore.

366
00:29:24,529 --> 00:29:29,023
Welcome. How tosee your ex- girlfriend
and live to tell about it.

367
00:29:29,234 --> 00:29:32,431
That is thesubject of today 's class.

368
00:29:32,670 --> 00:29:36,367
Sam, you didn't have to concoct some
story about wanting to borrow music...

369
00:29:36,574 --> 00:29:38,303
just to have an excuse tosee me.

370
00:29:38,543 --> 00:29:43,674
First the guy must act nice to prove
he can handle the breakup entirely.

371
00:29:43,882 --> 00:29:46,350
No, I really wanted
to borrow the album.

372
00:29:46,584 --> 00:29:51,044
But it is great tosee you. You finally
got your forehead pierced. Looks good.

373
00:29:51,256 --> 00:29:54,157
Being nice only makes the ex think
hewants to get back together...

374
00:29:54,359 --> 00:29:57,726
soshewith undisguised pleasure
reminds him...

375
00:29:57,929 --> 00:30:00,693
that she is the dumper
and he is the dumpee.

376
00:30:01,366 --> 00:30:04,529
I'm flatteredyou called,
but I broke upwith you, remember?

377
00:30:04,736 --> 00:30:06,761
This doesn't mean that lwant
to hook upwith you again.

378
00:30:07,005 --> 00:30:12,375
This unwarranted rejection hurts
like akick to thesheens.

379
00:30:12,844 --> 00:30:14,334
Really, Sam!

380
00:30:21,786 --> 00:30:25,278
Thesecond punishment
sneaks upon you like asnake.

381
00:30:27,392 --> 00:30:29,690
Come on! Go!

382
00:30:29,961 --> 00:30:33,795
I'm hot, I'm thirsty.
I'm hot, I'm thirsty!

383
00:30:33,998 --> 00:30:36,262
Hey, what ever happened
to thosesize 14 guys?

384
00:30:36,467 --> 00:30:38,765
They got on album, then disappeared.

385
00:30:39,771 --> 00:30:44,105
The evilshe- dumper tortures
the poor dumpeewith flirtations...

386
00:30:44,309 --> 00:30:46,106
he tries to avoid.

387
00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:50,379
- Didyour tongue healed upsome?
- Yes, it's never better.

388
00:30:50,582 --> 00:30:53,210
Really? It was pretty good before.

389
00:30:55,954 --> 00:30:58,582
Theshe- dumper is abig prick- tease.

390
00:30:58,790 --> 00:31:01,850
Does thescar tickles
the roof of your mouthsome?

391
00:31:01,993 --> 00:31:04,052
Yeah, it does. Youshould feel it.

392
00:31:04,295 --> 00:31:08,231
When the dumps chump flirts back,
shestops flirting.

393
00:31:08,733 --> 00:31:10,860
Sam, I toldyou!
We are definitely over!

394
00:31:11,102 --> 00:31:15,334
Giving him abad case...
of blue balls.

395
00:31:15,573 --> 00:31:18,167
I think Ishould be alawyer.
But then again lwant to be a vet.

396
00:31:18,543 --> 00:31:21,603
The final torment is theworst.

397
00:31:22,146 --> 00:31:24,706
What are you talking about?
I can't do any of those things, Isuck.

398
00:31:24,949 --> 00:31:27,417
No, you're really smart. You can
do anythingyouset your mind to.

399
00:31:27,619 --> 00:31:29,018
By theway, where am I takingyou?

400
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:32,678
We're going to meet Carl.
Be nice to him, he's my new boyfriend.

401
00:31:37,362 --> 00:31:39,626
It's aball- buster!

402
00:31:40,765 --> 00:31:42,858
Sam, this is Carl.

403
00:31:43,234 --> 00:31:45,168
- Hi.
- Hi.

404
00:31:45,403 --> 00:31:46,700
This albumcover.

405
00:31:46,938 --> 00:31:50,271
how did ripping it upconnect
to what was rippinguphope's heart?

406
00:31:50,475 --> 00:31:53,103
I playedthis album
until my ears bled.

407
00:31:53,311 --> 00:31:57,645
I hopedthe lyrics might provide
some insight to me or to anyone else.

408
00:32:01,686 --> 00:32:04,314
Hey butthead, turn that music!

409
00:32:05,490 --> 00:32:07,321
Please listen!

410
00:32:08,826 --> 00:32:12,159
Thanks for listening.
By theway, what are you today?

411
00:32:12,563 --> 00:32:15,657
A Vietnamwar memorial.

412
00:32:17,302 --> 00:32:19,099
Do you like music?

413
00:32:20,238 --> 00:32:22,001
What are you doing back there?

414
00:32:22,206 --> 00:32:25,403
Getting ready to battle
in the corporate jungle?

415
00:32:27,345 --> 00:32:28,812
Is that your war paint?

416
00:32:30,682 --> 00:32:34,448
God. I don't know why I even try.

417
00:32:38,690 --> 00:32:41,090
Do you mind if I call China?

418
00:32:41,592 --> 00:32:44,925
Hey, why do you have your
pager number inspeed dial?

419
00:32:47,665 --> 00:32:48,927
0h my God!

420
00:32:50,168 --> 00:32:52,898
- What are you doing?
- Nothing. I mean...

421
00:32:53,104 --> 00:32:55,265
Iwas just trying
to make conversation.

422
00:32:55,506 --> 00:32:57,406
How come youwon't
give me the time of day?

423
00:32:57,608 --> 00:32:59,303
Just give me my coffee.

424
00:32:59,510 --> 00:33:02,604
No, not untilyou give me
some answers.

425
00:33:02,814 --> 00:33:04,281
- Give it to me.
- No.

426
00:33:04,482 --> 00:33:07,007
Give mesomestraight answers
or the expresso gets it.

427
00:33:07,218 --> 00:33:09,015
Look, I got alot on my mind today...

428
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:11,381
and I don't have time to deal
withsomebody like you.

429
00:33:11,589 --> 00:33:14,285
Someone like me? Are yousaying
I'm alowly delivery guy?

430
00:33:14,492 --> 00:33:17,120
I don't get it. Youwomen
have always been treated like crap...

431
00:33:17,328 --> 00:33:20,991
by your boys club bosses and now
that you career girls are on top...

432
00:33:21,232 --> 00:33:22,961
why do you treat people
thesameway?

433
00:33:23,167 --> 00:33:25,397
Maybe lwouldn't have to act
likesuch abitch onwheels...

434
00:33:25,636 --> 00:33:27,627
if you guysweren't so angry
that I made more money than you.

435
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:30,069
- Now give it to me!
- Pretty cranky in the morning.

436
00:33:30,274 --> 00:33:31,798
Needyour caffeine fix, huh?

437
00:33:32,043 --> 00:33:34,204
You know what makes me angry
withwomensometimes?

438
00:33:34,445 --> 00:33:37,039
I am a gentleman, I always
open doors for women.

439
00:33:37,248 --> 00:33:38,613
But when awoman is in front of me
in an entrance...

440
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:41,341
9 times out of 10she doesn't
hold the door open for me.

441
00:33:41,552 --> 00:33:44,578
Youwant men to treat you as equals
but youwon't give us equal treatment!

442
00:33:44,789 --> 00:33:46,586
- What do youwant?
- Respect!

443
00:33:46,791 --> 00:33:49,259
A"hello, how are you?"
would be great for starters.

444
00:33:49,494 --> 00:33:52,054
0kay, how about a
"goodbye, and to hellwith you"?

445
00:34:01,272 --> 00:34:02,500
Stay.

446
00:34:13,117 --> 00:34:15,278
The plumber will pay me!

447
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:32,797
Stop trying to find out
what happened to Hope!

448
00:35:04,202 --> 00:35:08,070
See, all I have to do is to find the
girlwho has thisscar on her behind...

449
00:35:08,272 --> 00:35:10,502
And boom!You can crack the case.

450
00:35:23,521 --> 00:35:25,614
What are you doing?

451
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:40,904
I hope thewater isn't too cold!

452
00:35:43,541 --> 00:35:46,908
Rose, petal rose, petal beauty.

453
00:35:48,146 --> 00:35:50,410
Today I'm my vagina.

454
00:35:54,552 --> 00:35:59,512
To really complete that assignment
youshould add an orgasm to it.

455
00:36:13,538 --> 00:36:15,199
Harder!

456
00:36:17,708 --> 00:36:19,471
Deeper!

457
00:36:22,213 --> 00:36:26,013
You know that phrase"behind every
great man there's a great woman"?

458
00:36:26,217 --> 00:36:30,779
I'm afraid that I'll never be a great
man cause I can't get my great woman.

459
00:36:30,988 --> 00:36:32,717
I prefer the corollary.

460
00:36:32,924 --> 00:36:35,722
Behind every great woman
there's a great man.

461
00:36:36,227 --> 00:36:38,752
Look, I'mserious here, man.
I mean is it impossible...

462
00:36:38,963 --> 00:36:42,057
to become a great man
without a great woman?

463
00:36:42,266 --> 00:36:44,632
What is this?We don't stock these!

464
00:36:44,835 --> 00:36:46,393
Those are for me!

465
00:36:46,604 --> 00:36:50,062
"0lder & Bolder Magazine"?
"Grannies & Fannies Illustrated"?

466
00:36:50,274 --> 00:36:51,969
"Wide Load Review"?

467
00:36:53,077 --> 00:36:56,478
- "Stomp Monthly"?
- Shut up!

468
00:36:57,014 --> 00:36:59,505
I'm tired of you acting like I'm from
the bottom of the Bible belt.

469
00:37:00,117 --> 00:37:04,213
- At least I have f aced the awful truth.
- What awful truth?

470
00:37:04,488 --> 00:37:07,150
I am gross.

471
00:37:07,792 --> 00:37:12,923
All men are. And every day
we f ace the endless nightmare that...

472
00:37:13,130 --> 00:37:16,861
love handle by love handle,
nose hair by nose hair...

473
00:37:17,068 --> 00:37:21,266
we're becoming more grotesque
versions of the cute boyswewere.

474
00:37:22,306 --> 00:37:25,207
It is impossible tostop
the hordes of time...

475
00:37:25,409 --> 00:37:29,402
from destroying our muscle tone
and leaving uswith these...

476
00:37:29,614 --> 00:37:33,516
defeatedsaggy male boobies!

477
00:37:36,621 --> 00:37:42,958
But I am at peace. I have come to grips
with thewhore that has become me.

478
00:37:43,494 --> 00:37:48,295
So how does"Moist & Midget"
magazine improve your image?

479
00:37:48,499 --> 00:37:50,694
Because men are gross
on the inside too.

480
00:37:50,901 --> 00:37:52,766
That'swhy these magazinessell.

481
00:37:52,970 --> 00:37:55,530
A woman's pussy mount
is aslippery slope.

482
00:37:55,773 --> 00:38:00,176
Sex is anarcotic andyou, my friend,
are addicted just like me.

483
00:38:00,378 --> 00:38:03,279
0nly you're at thesmoking
marijuanastage...

484
00:38:03,481 --> 00:38:07,042
...l'm at the heroinstage.
- More like thespeed ballingstage.

485
00:38:07,385 --> 00:38:09,785
Good one. Now, my point is...

486
00:38:09,987 --> 00:38:14,822
an addict needs abigger and bigger fix
each time just to get thesame high!

487
00:38:15,026 --> 00:38:17,392
That'swhy they move on
to the hardstuff.

488
00:38:17,595 --> 00:38:19,290
Nowsex is thesameway.

489
00:38:19,497 --> 00:38:22,989
You needsomething kinkier and kinkier
to get thesame thrill in your drill!

490
00:38:23,234 --> 00:38:26,635
0kay, so hence
"America's Harriest" magazine?

491
00:38:26,904 --> 00:38:31,432
No, I don't know if"America's
Harriest" is gonna get me donkey dick.

492
00:38:31,642 --> 00:38:36,011
But, almost doner for aboner, and
these magazines aresomebody 's fix.

493
00:38:36,213 --> 00:38:37,908
They might give me apecker high,
they might not.

494
00:38:38,115 --> 00:38:40,310
You areso f ar off
you're not evenwrong!

495
00:38:40,551 --> 00:38:43,520
- It'sso much better with awoman.
- Don't foolyourself.

496
00:38:43,721 --> 00:38:46,747
Thestraight screw
is the methadone of sex.

497
00:38:46,957 --> 00:38:50,825
It'll keep you from the hardstuff
for awhile, but sooner or later...

498
00:38:51,028 --> 00:38:53,394
youwill roll off your old lady...

499
00:38:53,597 --> 00:38:56,930
just like an addict
f alls off thewagon.

500
00:38:57,468 --> 00:39:00,926
Accept it, Sam. You and I are alike.

501
00:39:01,138 --> 00:39:05,404
Your weirdness is onestep away
from my grossness.

502
00:39:05,609 --> 00:39:08,942
And look, you enrolled on anArt School
so you couldsee nakedwomen.

503
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:12,377
That is no different than me
looking at dirty pictures.

504
00:39:12,616 --> 00:39:14,106
It's completely different.

505
00:39:14,318 --> 00:39:17,617
0ne is art, the other is pornography!

506
00:39:17,888 --> 00:39:21,380
Yes, but once youstart
down the dark path...

507
00:39:21,592 --> 00:39:24,322
forever will it dominatrix
your destiny!

508
00:39:24,595 --> 00:39:25,994
Join me.

509
00:39:28,265 --> 00:39:30,324
I'll never join you!

510
00:39:31,302 --> 00:39:35,068
It's in your blood, Sam.
I amyour cousin.

511
00:39:43,481 --> 00:39:46,041
Now Holden and I did have
some of thesame DNA...

512
00:39:46,250 --> 00:39:48,775
and this meant that I could have
thesame genetic inclination as him...

513
00:39:48,986 --> 00:39:53,320
towards becoming a Grand Master
of perversion. Got mespooked.

514
00:39:56,193 --> 00:39:57,990
Trick or treat!

515
00:39:58,496 --> 00:40:00,157
Ishould've guessed.

516
00:40:00,798 --> 00:40:03,232
Who are yousupposed to be?

517
00:40:04,835 --> 00:40:06,268
I'm Popeye.

518
00:40:10,007 --> 00:40:11,304
Andwhat am Isupposed to be?

519
00:40:11,542 --> 00:40:14,670
You, my dear, are aFreudianslip.

520
00:40:15,746 --> 00:40:17,839
- You know what I can't stand?
- Trick or treat!

521
00:40:18,048 --> 00:40:20,039
Peoplewho aren't
who they say they are.

522
00:40:20,251 --> 00:40:23,880
Like... take, for instance,
wise old Mahatma Gandhi.

523
00:40:24,155 --> 00:40:28,285
Didyou know that in aspeech
advocating non- violent protest...

524
00:40:28,492 --> 00:40:30,460
he oncesaid that Mussolini
wasn't abad man?

525
00:40:30,661 --> 00:40:34,153
You know I had thesame feelingwhen
Isaw a comic book about the Pope.

526
00:40:34,365 --> 00:40:37,027
I mean, what does the Pope
need a comic book for?

527
00:40:37,268 --> 00:40:40,328
Yeah, and the idiots that wanna
read a comic book on the Pope!

528
00:40:40,538 --> 00:40:43,837
Yeah, exactly. Like"What do lwant?
Batman or the Pope?"

529
00:40:44,041 --> 00:40:47,499
Like the Popemobile is as cool
as the Batmobile. Come on!

530
00:40:47,711 --> 00:40:50,942
- We need to get some more candy.
- 0kay. I mean, don't get mewrong...

531
00:40:51,148 --> 00:40:53,309
I'm not aBible basher.

532
00:40:53,517 --> 00:40:57,954
And for the matter I also hate the
jerks on the other end of thespectrum.

533
00:40:58,155 --> 00:40:59,782
You know the ones?

534
00:40:59,990 --> 00:41:04,518
Got those old beat up cars
and abumper sticker that says like...

535
00:41:04,728 --> 00:41:07,060
"Don't laugh, your daughter
might be in the trunk."

536
00:41:08,032 --> 00:41:09,522
His name is Richard Blaine.

537
00:41:10,034 --> 00:41:13,197
I think he's the pecker
that broke Hope's heart.

538
00:41:13,404 --> 00:41:17,568
This party 's the perfect place for us to
get the girls give us ascheme on him.

539
00:41:17,775 --> 00:41:19,743
Gotcha. Let's probe.

540
00:41:22,112 --> 00:41:26,811
My friend Richard Blaine used to do
an acting exercise exactly like that.

541
00:41:27,351 --> 00:41:29,785
This isn't an exercise.

542
00:41:29,987 --> 00:41:32,455
This is how I dance.

543
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:39,427
So, do you know a guy
named Richard Blaine?

544
00:41:39,630 --> 00:41:41,188
Carl!

545
00:41:45,469 --> 00:41:48,927
Has anyone ever toldyou
you got arack that should be bronzed?

546
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:50,998
Beat it.

547
00:41:52,843 --> 00:41:56,404
You know my friend Richard Blaine
loves puzzles like this.

548
00:41:56,614 --> 00:41:58,479
Do you know him?

549
00:42:04,655 --> 00:42:06,452
Didyou get it done?

550
00:42:13,330 --> 00:42:15,992
Wait! How do I get out of this thing?

551
00:42:24,275 --> 00:42:27,438
What're you doing?
Finger fucking?

552
00:42:27,645 --> 00:42:31,172
No. It's a Chinese finger puzzle.

553
00:42:31,382 --> 00:42:36,877
See, the harder I pull
the morestuck I become.

554
00:42:37,521 --> 00:42:39,011
It happened to me once.

555
00:42:39,223 --> 00:42:41,783
Except that wasn't in apuzzle,
it was in anAsian chick.

556
00:42:41,992 --> 00:42:43,584
What was her name?

557
00:42:44,128 --> 00:42:45,925
Chew Me Wang.

558
00:42:47,464 --> 00:42:50,126
You know, this thing
has got me thinking.

559
00:42:50,935 --> 00:42:53,460
Hope is alot like this puzzle.

560
00:42:53,737 --> 00:42:58,697
The harder I try the further
I get away fromsolving it.

561
00:43:08,852 --> 00:43:13,016
If youwanna find out what happened
to Hope, do exactly as Isay...

562
00:43:13,223 --> 00:43:16,090
and keep absolutely quiet.

563
00:43:18,028 --> 00:43:19,757
Now wait here.

564
00:43:21,632 --> 00:43:28,231
If youwannahave the greatest sex
of your life, do exactly as Isay.

565
00:43:30,407 --> 00:43:31,840
Kinky.

566
00:43:32,042 --> 00:43:37,241
Do you know it gets me hot?
Doing it in completesilence.

567
00:43:54,331 --> 00:43:56,196
What are you doing?

568
00:43:57,868 --> 00:43:59,426
Sam?

569
00:43:59,637 --> 00:44:00,626
Holden?

570
00:44:00,871 --> 00:44:03,772
I toldyou tostop trying
to find out what happened to Hope!

571
00:44:03,974 --> 00:44:06,238
But youwouldn't listen!

572
00:44:07,411 --> 00:44:10,244
You know that Chinese finger puzzle?

573
00:44:10,481 --> 00:44:12,847
It doesn't just work on fingers!

574
00:44:18,055 --> 00:44:21,388
0h God! Holden, low your puppy!
Low your puppy!

575
00:44:24,194 --> 00:44:26,321
It's thewise guy!

576
00:44:33,470 --> 00:44:34,960
Thisway. Come on, thisway!

577
00:44:35,172 --> 00:44:36,434
Thisway!

578
00:44:43,013 --> 00:44:44,275
0h my God!

579
00:45:07,204 --> 00:45:08,364
Now cough.

580
00:45:15,713 --> 00:45:19,410
My heart's beatingso f ast I can't
reduce the blood flow, you know?

581
00:45:19,616 --> 00:45:23,017
You guys have been in the bathroom
along time. What's the holdup?

582
00:45:23,454 --> 00:45:26,014
- How are you doing, Holden?
- No luck.

583
00:45:26,223 --> 00:45:31,718
I need inspiration, I need...
impotence inspiring imagery.

584
00:45:33,097 --> 00:45:34,928
What is this?

585
00:45:35,365 --> 00:45:38,664
Check out this f at chick.
She's areal Bahamamama!

586
00:45:39,403 --> 00:45:42,600
She is f atty f atty f at f at!

587
00:45:42,806 --> 00:45:45,104
- I think it'sworking.
- Is it?

588
00:45:45,843 --> 00:45:49,006
- Really?
- Yes. It... is.

589
00:45:51,448 --> 00:45:54,849
Nothing likesomethingsaggy
to make you gosoggy.

590
00:45:55,052 --> 00:45:57,247
Here. Try it, Sam.

591
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,297
It's you, isn't it?

592
00:46:20,244 --> 00:46:23,304
What do yousay I take you out
for a cup of coffee?

593
00:46:24,047 --> 00:46:27,107
I can't. My mascarais allsmeared.

594
00:46:28,619 --> 00:46:31,816
And Ismeared my eyebrows too!

595
00:46:32,589 --> 00:46:35,319
It's okay.
It's okay, just wipe it off.

596
00:46:35,526 --> 00:46:39,929
I can't, ljust spilled the remover.
I'm a freak.

597
00:46:41,632 --> 00:46:44,863
Come on, Annie.
Let me take you out.

598
00:46:45,235 --> 00:46:48,864
See?We'll be freaks together.

599
00:46:51,441 --> 00:46:54,569
People back then used
to call me a Gargantuan.

600
00:46:55,145 --> 00:46:59,013
Now I'mwhat they call
nothingspecial, nothingscary.

601
00:47:01,385 --> 00:47:02,818
I think you're very cute.

602
00:47:06,056 --> 00:47:07,182
Thanks.

603
00:47:09,626 --> 00:47:10,752
Let mesee.

604
00:47:13,397 --> 00:47:15,092
It's very good.

605
00:47:15,332 --> 00:47:17,562
When lwas alittle kid...

606
00:47:17,768 --> 00:47:22,068
they used tosay that I looked like one
of thosestrange Dr. Seuss creatures.

607
00:47:22,272 --> 00:47:25,935
They called me Sam IAm. You know,
from"Green Eggs and Ham"?

608
00:47:26,143 --> 00:47:30,011
When they teased me, do you know
what I used to do to cheer myself up?

609
00:47:32,115 --> 00:47:35,414
"I like to eat themwhen they 're hot
I'd also eat them mixedwithsnot"

610
00:47:35,619 --> 00:47:38,918
"I'd eat them in the morning dew
I'll eat them 'til I have tospew"

611
00:47:39,156 --> 00:47:43,490
"I like to eat green eggs and ham
Yes, I do -  Sam IAm!"

612
00:47:52,035 --> 00:47:55,732
Well... goodnight, Sam IAm.

613
00:47:56,607 --> 00:47:58,472
Goodnight, Annie.

614
00:48:16,193 --> 00:48:18,161
Tanya, are you okay?

615
00:48:22,432 --> 00:48:26,129
Tanya, are you home?
It's Peggy, open up!

616
00:48:26,336 --> 00:48:27,769

617
00:48:28,405 --> 00:48:29,895
- 0h my God!

618
00:48:30,107 --> 00:48:32,302
- My phone is off the hook.
- This is your big break.

619
00:48:32,542 --> 00:48:35,272

620
00:48:35,479 --> 00:48:36,571

621
00:48:36,780 --> 00:48:37,769
- My god!

622
00:48:37,981 --> 00:48:41,439
I'mserious, man.
Her pager is her vibrator.

623
00:48:41,652 --> 00:48:44,382
Iwaswonderingwhy sheset
her pager number onspeed dial.

624
00:48:44,588 --> 00:48:47,284
It's anewspeed dial aidservice!

625
00:48:51,595 --> 00:48:52,960
Come.

626
00:48:53,597 --> 00:48:55,030
God!

627
00:48:58,402 --> 00:49:00,461
Man, we gottastop laughing.

628
00:49:00,671 --> 00:49:03,105
I'mstill recovering from
that Chinese puzzle!

629
00:49:03,307 --> 00:49:05,332
It hurts, doesn't it?

630
00:49:06,243 --> 00:49:10,873
...highSchool, where Mr.Delgado...
- Do you know her pager number?

631
00:49:11,815 --> 00:49:18,482
I think it was like555- 0068
or something. Why?

632
00:49:19,056 --> 00:49:21,650
- Testing out your theory.
- No, Holden. Don't!

633
00:49:23,260 --> 00:49:26,525
Give me that!
You know what your problem is, Sam?

634
00:49:26,730 --> 00:49:28,425
You're pussy- whipped.
Andyou're not even getting any pussy.

635
00:49:28,665 --> 00:49:32,192
This Tanyais treatingyou likescum
andyoustand up for her...

636
00:49:32,402 --> 00:49:35,667
becauseshe makes your pecker
stand up. Give me the phone!

637
00:49:35,906 --> 00:49:39,433
- No! Goscrew yourself, man!
- Precisely.

638
00:49:40,143 --> 00:49:44,375
That is the only way tostop awoman
from usingyour dick as astickshift...

639
00:49:44,581 --> 00:49:48,017
and drivingyou around town
on a full tank of your hormones!

640
00:49:48,752 --> 00:49:50,242
Take it from me, Sam.

641
00:49:50,454 --> 00:49:53,617
I cannot tellyou the number of times
a girl has got me to fix her car...

642
00:49:53,924 --> 00:49:57,257
or paint her house or
take her husband to the airport!

643
00:49:57,461 --> 00:50:00,430
Show them damn f armers market and
sit through the pain- in- the- ass opera.

644
00:50:00,630 --> 00:50:03,463
- Shut up, Jason! Shut up!
- No, Jason's right.

645
00:50:03,667 --> 00:50:05,794
Jason's ameathead, but he's right.

646
00:50:06,036 --> 00:50:11,668
Now listen, Sam. I did all kinds of
these things because a guy 's balls...

647
00:50:11,875 --> 00:50:15,436
are the biggest reservoir of hope
thisworld has ever seen!

648
00:50:15,645 --> 00:50:19,547
You know, trying to get laid by fixing
her f an belt is your f ault, yours!

649
00:50:19,850 --> 00:50:23,513
Sam, you'reso full of man gravy!

650
00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:27,486
Listen, you need to be more like me
and take matters into your own hands.

651
00:50:27,691 --> 00:50:29,522
Why do you think
they call it "masturbate"?

652
00:50:29,726 --> 00:50:33,662
Because it allows you to be
the master of your own f ate.

653
00:50:33,864 --> 00:50:35,661
And it's not just aphysical release.

654
00:50:35,866 --> 00:50:39,825
It's arelease of women's
control over you! Jason!

655
00:50:40,037 --> 00:50:43,063
You don't need them,
they can't manipulate you.

656
00:50:43,273 --> 00:50:48,370
I'm doing this for your own good.
Today is your independence day, Sam!

657
00:50:51,014 --> 00:50:53,380

663
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:18,769
Andso are you.

664
00:51:19,976 --> 00:51:24,310
After standingupfor Tanya,
Idecided Ishould stand upfor myself.

665
00:51:24,514 --> 00:51:28,109
Specially withthe evil
shedumper, Gretchen.

666
00:51:28,318 --> 00:51:30,377
You know what, Gretchen?
It just occurred to me.

667
00:51:30,587 --> 00:51:32,555
You're just like this bike.

668
00:51:32,856 --> 00:51:36,815
I'm cool, I'm thirsty.
I'm cool, I'm thirsty.

669
00:51:37,027 --> 00:51:39,359
- You'reso directionless.
- I don't know what lwant to do.

670
00:51:39,563 --> 00:51:42,532
0n one hand I could be a graphic
designer, or I could be asinger...

671
00:51:42,732 --> 00:51:45,360
or I could be a doctor, or I could be
apet detective, or I could...

672
00:51:45,669 --> 00:51:50,299
And I'm always pumping up your ego
like"you're very creative"...

673
00:51:50,507 --> 00:51:52,532
- I'm creative.
- ..."You're very smart"...

674
00:51:52,742 --> 00:51:54,676
- I'msmart.
- ..."You're very sexy"...

675
00:51:54,878 --> 00:51:58,075
I'msexy. I amsexy.

676
00:51:58,281 --> 00:52:00,272
You're really on maintenance.

677
00:52:00,484 --> 00:52:02,384
- Come on, let's go.
- But Carl is the other way.

678
00:52:02,619 --> 00:52:03,677
Yeah, but I gotta go now.

679
00:52:03,887 --> 00:52:06,048
But youwouldn't even have this bike
if I hadn't given you mine.

680
00:52:06,256 --> 00:52:08,190
You know what?
It's your bike andyou can keep it.

681
00:52:08,391 --> 00:52:10,621
Because it's areal piece of work.

682
00:52:10,827 --> 00:52:12,419
Alright!

683
00:52:13,163 --> 00:52:16,724
I'll give it to Carl.
I don't needyou to ride my bike!

684
00:52:17,968 --> 00:52:20,960
What happened to the breaks?
Sam, help!

685
00:52:23,573 --> 00:52:26,133
- Sugar with the coffee, right?
- Yeah, please.

686
00:52:29,412 --> 00:52:32,279
You know what Isaw on the
shopping tent the other day?

687
00:52:32,482 --> 00:52:35,349
They 'reselling action figures
of the Pope.

688
00:52:35,552 --> 00:52:36,985
Really?

689
00:52:37,187 --> 00:52:39,178
What are you doingwith my box?

690
00:52:39,389 --> 00:52:40,947
That we can play checkers.

691
00:52:49,232 --> 00:52:53,134
Sowhat do you dowhen there's
somethingyou really want...

692
00:52:53,837 --> 00:52:56,635
but you know you can never have it?

693
00:52:56,840 --> 00:52:59,274
You become a delivery guy
for your uncle.

694
00:53:00,277 --> 00:53:04,543
But becoming an artist... is that
what you alwayswanted to do?

695
00:53:06,416 --> 00:53:08,714
So thenwhy didyou quit?

696
00:53:09,519 --> 00:53:12,420
'Cause my f avorite teacher
told me I couldn't draw.

697
00:53:14,224 --> 00:53:16,215
People arewrong all the time.

698
00:53:19,796 --> 00:53:21,730
Why don't you draw me?

699
00:53:22,032 --> 00:53:23,727
Forget it.

700
00:53:23,934 --> 00:53:26,903
I used to pose for art classes
all the time.

701
00:53:29,105 --> 00:53:31,164
I could never do you justice.

702
00:53:31,374 --> 00:53:34,775
If you draw me,
I'llshow you my etchings.

703
00:53:36,213 --> 00:53:39,876
Well, I'msure your etchings
are amasterpiece.

704
00:53:43,286 --> 00:53:46,483
You really need tosee the
cross- etching to appreciate it.

705
00:54:37,941 --> 00:54:39,909
- Let'ssee.
- No, it's terrible.

706
00:54:40,176 --> 00:54:43,612
Come on. Let mesee.
I let yousee.

707
00:54:46,850 --> 00:54:50,149
That's not terrible.
Why do you think it's bad?

708
00:54:50,387 --> 00:54:52,855
Look at thespatial relationships.

709
00:54:53,056 --> 00:54:56,753
That's too exaggerated.
Barely looks like you.

710
00:54:56,993 --> 00:54:59,553
I made you funny- looking.
It's like a5- year- old did this.

711
00:55:01,164 --> 00:55:04,133
Iwas just watching aspecial
on Picasso.

712
00:55:04,334 --> 00:55:06,859
You know what hesaid
about his own drawings?

713
00:55:07,070 --> 00:55:09,538
That he'dstrive
to draw like a child.

714
00:55:09,739 --> 00:55:12,537
Because hesaid that a child's
drawings are unaffected by rules...

715
00:55:12,742 --> 00:55:15,074
and they are extremely expressive.

716
00:55:15,278 --> 00:55:18,008
They truthfully show
what's inside the child.

717
00:55:18,848 --> 00:55:24,252
Yeah, but lwasn't striving to draw
like a child. Just happened by mistake.

718
00:55:25,288 --> 00:55:28,052
Maybe your mistakes
are really your style.

719
00:55:29,492 --> 00:55:31,722
Maybewe make
mistakes because...

720
00:55:31,928 --> 00:55:34,761
deep downwe really
want to make them.

721
00:55:36,466 --> 00:55:37,831
I lost my job thanks to you!

722
00:55:38,101 --> 00:55:40,626
I didn't make those calls, alright?
It was my cousin Holden.

723
00:55:40,837 --> 00:55:44,170
His dad own this place.
It's true, I tried tostop him.

724
00:55:44,374 --> 00:55:45,432
You're lying.

725
00:55:45,642 --> 00:55:47,473
No, really. Holden and I got
into abig fight about it.

726
00:55:47,677 --> 00:55:50,407
- Yeah, right.
- Just because I'm a guy...

727
00:55:50,647 --> 00:55:53,445
doesn't mean I'm out toscrew you.
Why do you hate menso much?

728
00:55:53,650 --> 00:55:55,174
Women are just superior to men.

729
00:55:55,485 --> 00:55:57,282
- Like how?
- Like you can't have babies.

730
00:55:57,487 --> 00:56:00,047
- You can't open jars of peanut butter.
- Women mature f aster than men.

731
00:56:00,290 --> 00:56:03,191
- Men are f aster in the bathroom.
- Allserial killers are men.

732
00:56:03,393 --> 00:56:06,658
- Almost all cereal box mascot are men.
- Women can have multiple orgasms.

733
00:56:06,863 --> 00:56:09,229
- We don't have to f ake them.
- Women live longer than men.

734
00:56:09,466 --> 00:56:12,594
- It's away we can get away fromyou.
- You can't take anythingseriously.

735
00:56:12,802 --> 00:56:15,430
- You can't take a joke.
- I don't need aman for a thing.

736
00:56:15,638 --> 00:56:17,606
You just set your beepers on vibrate.

737
00:56:18,875 --> 00:56:20,934
0kay! So put your hands up here, pal!

738

00:59:32,435 --> 00:59:35,836
- Does it work?
- Worked for me hundreds of times.

00:59:36,573 --> 00:59:38,404

Hello, my name is Annie,
I'm a chocoholic.

780
00:59:41,611 --> 00:59:44,136
I've been cocoa free for
1year, 3 months and6 days.

0kay, I'msorry. I forgot.
Let me get a taste here.

783
00:59:54,190 --> 00:59:55,487
That's good.

784
00:59:56,059 --> 00:59:58,027
Didyou know that chocolate
has thesame chemical in it...

785
00:59:58,227 --> 00:59:59,922
that your body produces
when you're in love?

786
01:00:00,229 --> 01:00:03,824
- Is that true?
- I don't know for sure, I've...

787
01:00:05,201 --> 01:00:08,170
never been in love before,
but that'swhat they say.

788
01:00:10,340 --> 01:00:13,070
- You have nice legs.
- No.

789
01:00:14,477 --> 01:00:16,672
Please just stop looking at them.

790
01:00:17,013 --> 01:00:18,810
Let mesee your butt.

No, I don't want you tosee my legs,

792
01:00:22,118 --> 01:00:24,814
No, it just occurred to me I never

793
01:00:25,021 --> 01:00:27,387

795
01:00:46,976 --> 01:00:50,605
Don't worry, Annie.
No one is to look at your behind.

796
01:00:50,847 --> 01:00:56,183
You can just let bigstrong guy like me
get in touchwith Miss Sweet Cheeks.

797
01:00:56,419 --> 01:00:59,752
That's not f air, Mr. Hand
is to have all the fun!

798
01:01:00,023 --> 01:01:05,051
That's not true, Signor Chin.
Johnny 0ne- Eye is to have all the fun.

799
01:01:05,261 --> 01:01:06,626
Correction, Sir Belly!

800
01:01:06,829 --> 01:01:10,424
Johnny 0ne- Eye is alot uptight,
he never gets tosee the light of day.

801
01:01:10,733 --> 01:01:14,134
You can't keep me in here forever!
lwill rise again!

802
01:01:14,370 --> 01:01:17,567
Johnny! I hate it whenwe're apart.

803
01:01:17,774 --> 01:01:20,470
You are the Shakespeare
of Body Part Theater.

804
01:01:20,677 --> 01:01:22,338
Well...

805
01:01:24,547 --> 01:01:28,779
if this is the theater, then I think
you're missingsomething.

806
01:01:29,786 --> 01:01:33,313
A womanso beautiful...

807
01:01:34,824 --> 01:01:38,419
needs a diamond necklace
whenshe goes to ashow.

808
01:01:41,998 --> 01:01:43,022
You like that?

809
01:01:43,232 --> 01:01:45,792
Well, if you're my date...

810
01:01:46,002 --> 01:01:50,632

underdressed, I think.

811
01:02:38,020 --> 01:02:40,614
Please, give me akiss!

812
01:02:46,262 --> 01:02:49,163

01:03:07,884 --> 01:03:10,409
How about givingsome tongue?

You know what?

816
01:03:28,905 --> 01:03:31,772
- Hey, Annie.
- Hey, Sam IAm.

817
01:03:32,575 --> 01:03:34,702
Does this building
have astorage place?

818
01:03:34,911 --> 01:03:37,141
Yeah, in the basement. Why?

819
01:03:37,346 --> 01:03:40,406
I thought maybe Hope
havestoredsomething there.

820
01:03:40,616 --> 01:03:42,811
Maybewe can findsomething out.

821
01:03:46,923 --> 01:03:48,083
What?

822
01:03:48,925 --> 01:03:53,589
Nothing, ljust...
kind of figuredwe're together.

823

You made your choice.

844
01:09:02,371 --> 01:09:04,771
- Come on, please, Annie! 0pen the door!

845
01:09:16,018 --> 01:09:19,476

01:09:20,022 --> 01:09:21,546
Wait! I can explain!

847
01:09:51,754 --> 01:09:54,052
How is that portable
pocket pussy going?

848
01:09:55,958 --> 01:09:59,917
- That's not what it is.
- Yeah, sure it is. Look at that thing.

849
01:10:00,162 --> 01:10:03,188
Got alittle nickname for it?
Cock- Sucky Sue?

850
01:10:03,399 --> 01:10:06,334
I know you just can't wait to get
your tongue in there and lub it up.

851
01:10:09,471 --> 01:10:11,905
Shut up! It's my turn to talk.

852
01:10:12,174 --> 01:10:14,074
This device is for my...

853
01:10:14,343 --> 01:10:17,369
por... problem. I can't even
say theword, but...

854
01:10:17,580 --> 01:10:19,309
let's just say that's how it spells,
like aport.

855
01:10:19,648 --> 01:10:23,675
You know how addicts useso many
drugs they can't get high anymore?

856
01:10:23,886 --> 01:10:26,616
That'swhat happened to me, man.
I overdosed on hardcore and now...

857
01:10:26,822 --> 01:10:27,846
I can't get ahard- on.

858
01:10:28,123 --> 01:10:30,990
While holdenwastelling me
about his important problem...

859
01:10:31,193 --> 01:10:32,626
that'swhen I heard it.

860
01:10:32,928 --> 01:10:34,919
What was humphrey Bogart's
character's name...

861
01:10:35,130 --> 01:10:37,257
inthe classic film"Casablanca"?

862
01:10:37,466 --> 01:10:39,127

863
01:10:39,335 --> 01:10:43,465

01:10:43,672 --> 01:10:45,867
- Here, I'llshut off.

865
01:10:46,275 --> 01:10:48,175
Congratulations.

866
01:10:49,111 --> 01:10:51,477
Ishouldn't have got that used.

867
01:10:52,448 --> 01:10:55,713
Richard Blaine,
as in"Play it again, Sam".

868
01:10:55,918 --> 01:10:58,386
Might aswell been
"You've been played, Sam."

869
01:10:58,587 --> 01:11:00,452
But lwasn't gonnabe played
any longer.

870
01:11:00,656 --> 01:11:03,955
I now had ahunch.
I just neededto test it.

871
01:11:06,629 --> 01:11:09,359
Mr. Willens, please let me by
this one last time.

872
01:11:09,999 --> 01:11:14,436
You take one morestep forward,
you're gonna findyourself in chunks.

873
01:11:14,637 --> 01:11:16,468
In my stool.

874
01:11:16,672 --> 01:11:18,572
And no one's gonna care.

875
01:11:30,619 --> 01:11:33,349
I'm just protecting the girls
from the likes of you.

876
01:11:33,956 --> 01:11:36,356
You're the one they need
protection from!

877
01:11:36,625 --> 01:11:39,458
- Who's gonnabelieve you?
- They will.

878
01:11:39,662 --> 01:11:42,392
When they find that
you're the grossest man alive.

879
01:11:42,598 --> 01:11:47,661
- Thend grossest! Let my friend go!
- How are you gonnamake me do that?

880
01:12:07,623 --> 01:12:09,853
Ho- Chi mama!

881
01:12:20,102 --> 01:12:22,093
Come on, girls!

882
01:12:23,205 --> 01:12:25,173
That's allyou got?

883
01:12:36,785 --> 01:12:38,616
Hello, ladies.

884
01:12:41,623 --> 01:12:43,386
So that's my story.

885
01:12:43,792 --> 01:12:45,987
And I can tell by the looks
on your f aces...

886
01:12:46,195 --> 01:12:49,858
there's gonnabe only oneway
of convincingyou to let me go.

887
01:12:51,400 --> 01:12:53,459
Willyou let meshow you?

888
01:13:06,115 --> 01:13:09,346
Yousee, this is irrefutable proof
that men are gross.

889
01:13:09,551 --> 01:13:14,181
Maybe Ishould be more precise: men
without women are absolutely gross.

890
01:14:07,409 --> 01:14:10,936
I did all of this, everything,
for awoman.

891
01:14:12,748 --> 01:14:14,409
Men needyou.

892
01:14:15,584 --> 01:14:18,144
Men needwomen tosave us
from ourselves.

893
01:14:20,055 --> 01:14:21,716
Alright, let him go.

894
01:14:33,735 --> 01:14:36,067
I brought you down, you circus freak!

895
01:14:38,273 --> 01:14:40,400
So you're the onewho paged me?

896
01:14:41,910 --> 01:14:43,434
- How didyou find out?
- Sam.

897
01:14:43,846 --> 01:14:46,679
He told me you guys
had a fight over it.

898
01:14:47,416 --> 01:14:51,876
- Hewas right. Men are gross.
- And I'm the perfect example.

899
01:14:52,087 --> 01:14:56,023
But he forgot to mention one thing:
that men can also be heroic.

900
01:14:56,825 --> 01:15:00,090
I think it's apretty noble thing
you did, coming to his rescue.

901
01:15:00,295 --> 01:15:01,887
Why didyou do it?

902
01:15:02,264 --> 01:15:04,459
I didn't want him to end up like me.

903
01:15:15,844 --> 01:15:18,779
Hi. ljust wanted to makesure
that after the other night...

904
01:15:18,981 --> 01:15:21,313
that we'restill good, still friends.

905
01:15:21,517 --> 01:15:23,178
0f course.

906
01:15:45,741 --> 01:15:47,265
How didyou know?

907
01:15:47,776 --> 01:15:50,176
All the clues, they were red herrings.

908
01:15:51,380 --> 01:15:52,813
What's going on?

909
01:15:54,182 --> 01:15:56,047
Please don't be mad.

910
01:15:59,054 --> 01:16:00,885
I don't even know where tostart.

911
01:16:02,224 --> 01:16:06,092
Why not by telling me if you've really
beensad for all theses months?

912
01:16:06,495 --> 01:16:10,693
Yes. Thewhole time.
Willyou pleasesit?

913
01:16:13,368 --> 01:16:16,633
I lost someone really close to me.
Jesse.

914
01:16:16,838 --> 01:16:20,740
Hewas my best friend in thewhole
world ever since I can remember.

915
01:16:25,948 --> 01:16:27,643
Let's dosome hairdo.

916
01:16:31,286 --> 01:16:33,652
Six months ago,
everything changed.

917
01:16:39,861 --> 01:16:41,089
Jesse!

918
01:16:42,631 --> 01:16:44,155
- What?
- What are you doing?

919
01:16:44,600 --> 01:16:49,902
I don't know. Westarted being
friends, Hope. You know...

920
01:16:51,573 --> 01:16:53,598
Iwannabe your boyfriend.

921
01:16:53,976 --> 01:16:57,571
Haven't you ever
thought of me that way before?

922
01:16:58,580 --> 01:17:03,813
Not really. I mean you've
always been a true friend.

923
01:17:04,019 --> 01:17:06,249
Someone that I can trust.

924
01:17:06,488 --> 01:17:08,251
Like abrother.

925
01:17:08,457 --> 01:17:13,656
Andyou've always been this guy that
has never f ailed to make mesmile.

926
01:17:15,864 --> 01:17:21,359
That'sso nice!You know,
but... Iwant more than this.

927
01:17:21,570 --> 01:17:24,903
0kay? If lwanted a friend
I'd go hang out with the guys.

928
01:17:25,107 --> 01:17:30,238
Men don't want female friends.
All menwant are girlfriends.

929
01:17:30,879 --> 01:17:34,940
Sowhy don't we kiss andsee if
there's any spark between us, okay?

930
01:17:37,152 --> 01:17:40,178
- Jesse, please! Don't!
- I don't get this!

931
01:17:40,389 --> 01:17:43,222
Last week Isaw you make out with
some guy you'd known for an hour...

932
01:17:43,458 --> 01:17:47,087
but youwon't kiss me?
Hope, I've known you all my life!

933
01:17:47,329 --> 01:17:50,924
Let's just kiss andsee how it feels,
alright? Let's just kiss.

934
01:17:51,133 --> 01:17:53,931
- Just give me a...
- Please! Stop!

935
01:17:54,136 --> 01:17:55,535
Get off!

936
01:17:59,341 --> 01:18:02,276
You owe me this, Hope, okay?
Give me a fucking kiss!

937
01:18:02,477 --> 01:18:04,502
- Get off! Stop it!
- Shut up!

938
01:18:04,746 --> 01:18:06,077
- Jesse, don't...!
- Give me akiss!

939
01:18:06,314 --> 01:18:08,714
Stop it! Get off!

940
01:18:09,384 --> 01:18:10,681
Get off of me!

941
01:18:13,789 --> 01:18:17,691
That'swhen Icame to believe that I
could never trust aman's friendship.

942
01:18:17,893 --> 01:18:20,623
Because amanwasonly doing it
because he wanted more.

943
01:18:20,829 --> 01:18:24,822
And if Icouldn't trust men as a friend
how could lever trust men as alover?

944
01:18:25,033 --> 01:18:27,627
Then I met you again.

945
01:18:28,370 --> 01:18:30,668
- Hope!
- Hello, Sam.

946
01:18:30,872 --> 01:18:34,205
Itold Annie about everything because
she and I had became really close.

947
01:18:36,211 --> 01:18:37,940
He's out there again.

948
01:18:38,146 --> 01:18:40,808
If Sam could prove that
hewas your true friend...

949
01:18:41,016 --> 01:18:42,881
wouldyou let him be your true love?

950
01:18:43,085 --> 01:18:46,646
Andwould Santa Claus bring him
here for Christmas, Annie?

951
01:18:47,689 --> 01:18:50,385
Couldn't hurt tosee how f ar he'd go.

952
01:18:51,093 --> 01:18:54,620
Ever since I met you lwanted
to take you to dinner and the movies.

953
01:18:54,863 --> 01:18:57,423
He's out there. What do I do?

954
01:18:58,133 --> 01:19:00,601
He just wants to know
why you'resosad.

955
01:19:03,171 --> 01:19:05,264
Let's give himsome clues.

956
01:19:06,074 --> 01:19:09,737
- An album cover? That's not a clue.
- But Sam doesn't know that.

957
01:19:10,011 --> 01:19:11,876
Weshould just stop, okay?

958
01:19:12,080 --> 01:19:15,572
I'm gonnabe even more depressed
if Sam turns out to be just like Jesse.

959
01:19:15,784 --> 01:19:18,116
We can't, we're in too deep.

960
01:19:21,356 --> 01:19:23,654
Here he comes! Here he comes!

961
01:19:24,826 --> 01:19:26,760
"I cried my eyes out..."

962
01:19:26,962 --> 01:19:32,923
And thenwrite: "...that Richard Blaine
knows nothing about love."

963
01:19:33,502 --> 01:19:35,970
Finally something presented itself.

964
01:19:37,072 --> 01:19:39,267
I think Sam likes me.

965
01:19:44,446 --> 01:19:46,539
Just do one thing for me.

966
01:19:47,883 --> 01:19:49,851
Stop trying to help Hope.

967
01:19:50,051 --> 01:19:52,178
Ididn't plan for this finaltest.

968
01:19:53,255 --> 01:19:57,351
No, she's my friend.
I can't abandon her.

969
01:19:57,592 --> 01:19:59,116
But it allseemedworth it.

970
01:19:59,427 --> 01:20:02,760
Youstillwanted to be my friend
even after you had a girlfriend...

971
01:20:03,031 --> 01:20:05,966
and at the risk of losing
the girlfriend.

972
01:20:06,168 --> 01:20:08,762
That'swhen I had proof
that you are for real.

973
01:20:09,671 --> 01:20:11,764
Youwere a true friend.

974
01:20:11,973 --> 01:20:15,204
And now I've f allen
completely in lovewith you.

975
01:20:15,844 --> 01:20:18,369
Andwhy aren't yousmiling now?

976
01:20:18,947 --> 01:20:22,144
- Because you're not smiling.
- What didyou expect?

977
01:20:22,384 --> 01:20:26,218
I knew lwasweird,
but I didn't know lwasstupid.

978
01:20:26,421 --> 01:20:27,979
Sam, you're not stupid.

979
01:20:28,190 --> 01:20:32,524
Andwhat you think isweird
I find charming.

980
01:20:32,794 --> 01:20:35,854
Andwhat you call
accidentally funny...

981
01:20:36,264 --> 01:20:38,630
I call plainly funny.

982
01:20:39,100 --> 01:20:43,093
It's theway to awoman's heart,
Sam. By making her smile.

983
01:20:44,272 --> 01:20:45,796
Andyou've made mesmile.

984
01:20:47,843 --> 01:20:52,075
Yeah, but all of this...
none of this is real.

985
01:20:53,548 --> 01:20:55,175
This is real.

986
01:21:23,411 --> 01:21:26,710
Carl! Come on! It hurts!

987
01:21:26,915 --> 01:21:30,009
God! Hurry up, you idiot!
What'swrongwith you?

01:23:04,579 --> 01:23:06,547
Well, she loves you.

1011
01:23:07,315 --> 01:23:09,681
She didn't plan it, but it happened.

1012
01:23:11,886 --> 01:23:14,081
And I know you care for her too.

1013

You have to decide for yourself.

01:24:38,907 --> 01:24:41,171
Annie, look, I need to talk to you.

1022
01:24:42,677 --> 01:24:44,042

- lwannahelp you get yours back.
- I'll find it myself.

1026
01:24:55,890 --> 01:24:58,586
When I get to the bottom of this
chocolate- chocolate chip.

1027
01:24:58,793 --> 01:25:00,852
Look, Annie, I love you.

1028
01:25:02,730 --> 01:25:05,893
That's kind of hard for me to believe
after everythingyou've done for her.

1029
01:25:06,101 --> 01:25:08,865
Look, it's true. Remember all those
drawings I did the other night...

1030
01:25:09,070 --> 01:25:10,731
when lwas camped
outside of Hope's door?

1031
01:25:10,939 --> 01:25:13,430
They weren't of her.
They were of you, they 're all of you.

1032
01:25:13,675 --> 01:25:16,371
- That meanssomething, right?
- You're confused.

1033
01:25:16,811 --> 01:25:20,508
You've hurt Gargantuan, the girl
who's f at but has a great personality.

1034
01:25:21,416 --> 01:25:25,876
Now you feel guilty. You think
you care about me but it's just pity.

1035
01:25:28,189 --> 01:25:29,178
Goodbye, Sam.

1036
01:25:29,390 --> 01:25:32,621
No, Annie, don't. I'm not leaving
here untilyou look at this.

1037
01:25:32,827 --> 01:25:34,055
Annie, please!

1038
01:25:56,918 --> 01:25:58,408
What's in the case?

1039
01:25:58,620 --> 01:26:01,350
- Got any dirty pictures in here?
- Give it back!

1040
01:26:01,956 --> 01:26:05,756
You know, the cops came by
to talk to me the other day.

1041
01:26:05,960 --> 01:26:08,793
Now I gotta take this cab down to the
station and answer more questions.

1042
01:26:09,297 --> 01:26:12,596
These drawings are irreplaceable,
willyou just please give them back?

1043
01:26:14,435 --> 01:26:18,166
These are all of thesame girl!
That bitch, Annie!

1044
01:26:18,373 --> 01:26:20,898
- Give it back.
- Why should I?

1045
01:26:21,109 --> 01:26:25,546
Look, if you do, lwon't tell the cops
that youwere on those passageways.

1046
01:26:25,747 --> 01:26:30,207
I need those drawings toshow Annie
how much I care for her.

1047
01:26:30,418 --> 01:26:34,354
If I lose the drawings I'm gonna
lose Annie. Now give them back!

1048
01:26:34,789 --> 01:26:38,885
You know, I may be the pervert
the cops are looking for...

1049
01:26:39,093 --> 01:26:41,561
but I'm not going down for it.

1050
01:26:42,630 --> 01:26:44,791
No, I think I'm gonnakeep these.

1051
01:26:45,099 --> 01:26:49,502
The cops may be curious about these.
All of thesame girl?

1052
01:26:49,804 --> 01:26:51,795
Looks to me like
you got an obsession.

1053
01:26:52,307 --> 01:26:56,004
The cops are gonnaperk upwhen
I tell themyou've beenstalking her.

1057
01:27:16,197 --> 01:27:18,961

Iwas on my knees
