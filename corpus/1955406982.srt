1
00:01:36,263 --> 00:01:38,140
What do you want?

2
00:01:46,982 --> 00:01:50,031
I want him.

3
00:01:50,235 --> 00:01:53,660
I want him back.

4
00:01:53,864 --> 00:01:54,911
I want him back!

5
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:55,490
Aah!

6
00:01:55,699 --> 00:01:56,746
Oh!

7
00:01:58,869 --> 00:02:03,921
Oh, no! No! Aah!

8
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:05,421
Aah!

9
00:02:26,021 --> 00:02:27,568
Oh!

10
00:02:54,508 --> 00:02:56,727
Open the door, Paige.

11
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:01,690
I know you're in there.

12
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:03,563
I know you're in there.

13
00:03:03,767 --> 00:03:06,020
Come on, Paige, open the door.

14
00:03:06,228 --> 00:03:09,107
Please open the door!

15
00:03:09,314 --> 00:03:10,907
Open up, Paige!

16
00:03:11,108 --> 00:03:12,108
Open up!

17
00:03:14,403 --> 00:03:15,996
OK, Paige.

18
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:18,164
I'm gonna come in.

19
00:03:18,365 --> 00:03:20,083
I'm gonna come in.

20
00:03:20,283 --> 00:03:21,785
I'm coming in!

21
00:03:21,993 --> 00:03:24,712
Aaaaaaah!

22
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:33,680
Hey, Paige.

23
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:36,008
Paige, it's Janice.

24
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:39,094
You gonna talk?

25
00:03:42,597 --> 00:03:45,271
Paige?!

26
00:03:48,979 --> 00:03:51,232
Please, please. I'm so sorry.

27
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:54,034
I'm so sorry. Please, please.

28
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:55,030
Please. I'm so sorry.

29
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:56,532
Yeah, I'm sorry, Paige.

30
00:03:56,737 --> 00:03:57,454
I'm sorry, too.

31
00:03:57,654 --> 00:03:58,654
Aah!

32
00:04:01,116 --> 00:04:05,212
Paige.

33
00:04:05,412 --> 00:04:11,135
Paige. Paige!

34
00:04:11,334 --> 00:04:12,506
Aaaaaah!

35
00:04:17,549 --> 00:04:19,096
Aah!

36
00:04:25,807 --> 00:04:28,731
What do I do with this?

37
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:35,279
Ohhh!

38
00:04:35,484 --> 00:04:36,235
No, no!

39
00:04:36,443 --> 00:04:37,443
Aah!

40
00:04:45,368 --> 00:04:47,746
Hello? Hello?

41
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:49,956
Please help me.

42
00:04:50,165 --> 00:04:51,257
Please help me.

43
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:54,052
Somebody's in my...in my house,

44
00:04:54,252 --> 00:04:56,550
and she's...

45
00:04:56,755 --> 00:04:58,007
No, she's still here.

46
00:04:58,215 --> 00:04:59,215
I don't know.

47
00:05:01,092 --> 00:05:04,722
Plea...um, uh, at

48
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:07,809
1134 Fairway Drive.

49
00:05:08,016 --> 00:05:10,064
Please.

50
00:05:10,268 --> 00:05:15,570
I don't know. She shot me.

51
00:05:15,774 --> 00:05:19,199
Please. Please.

52
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:28,327
I'm gonna...

53
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:13,608
How you doing?

54
00:07:13,808 --> 00:07:16,277
OK. How are you?

55
00:07:16,478 --> 00:07:18,196
Can't complain.

56
00:07:18,396 --> 00:07:20,990
Something I can help you with?

57
00:07:21,191 --> 00:07:23,319
Well, uh...

58
00:07:23,526 --> 00:07:24,526
I...I don't know.

59
00:07:24,694 --> 00:07:26,367
I'm not sure what I'm looking

60
00:07:26,571 --> 00:07:26,992
for.

61
00:07:27,197 --> 00:07:28,995
Well, I reckon it's a gun or

62
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:30,325
you wouldn't be here.

63
00:07:31,785 --> 00:07:32,786
Yeah, I guess.

64
00:07:32,994 --> 00:07:34,792
Did you have something in

65
00:07:34,996 --> 00:07:35,371
mind?

66
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:37,048
No, not really.

67
00:07:37,248 --> 00:07:39,421
Uh, know anything about guns?

68
00:07:39,626 --> 00:07:40,752
No.

69
00:07:40,961 --> 00:07:47,014
Well, let's see.

70
00:07:47,217 --> 00:07:50,266
Ah.

71
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:53,394
This here is a stainless-steel

72
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:55,976
.38 special, and it holds six

73
00:07:56,184 --> 00:07:57,731
rounds.

74
00:08:09,197 --> 00:08:10,574
Ooh, it's heavy.

75
00:08:10,782 --> 00:08:12,580
Aw, it's not too bad.

76
00:08:12,784 --> 00:08:14,286
Ever fired a gun before?

77
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:15,165
No, sir.

78
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:17,168
Well, this one's just perfect

79
00:08:17,372 --> 00:08:18,123
for you, then.

80
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:19,958
Not much kick to it, which is

81
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:20,837
good for a lady.

82
00:08:21,042 --> 00:08:22,259
And it's a revolver, so you

83
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:23,580
don't have to worry about it

84
00:08:23,712 --> 00:08:25,464
ever jamming.

85
00:08:25,672 --> 00:08:27,595
Hold it up.

86
00:08:33,805 --> 00:08:35,933
How's it feel?

87
00:08:36,141 --> 00:08:36,937
Good, I guess.

88
00:08:37,142 --> 00:08:38,394
<i>You should never buy a gun</i>

89
00:08:38,601 --> 00:08:40,069
unless it feels just right in

90
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:43,524
your hands.

91
00:08:43,732 --> 00:08:47,202
Yeah, it feels good.

92
00:08:47,402 --> 00:08:48,745
How much does it cost?

93
00:08:48,945 --> 00:08:51,448
Oh, I could do, say...

94
00:08:51,656 --> 00:08:53,078
$150.

95
00:08:53,283 --> 00:08:56,127
OK. Uh...

96
00:08:56,327 --> 00:08:57,624
Don't I have to wait a couple of

97
00:08:57,829 --> 00:08:58,500
days or so?

98
00:08:58,705 --> 00:08:59,422
Nope, not no more.

99
00:08:59,622 --> 00:09:00,919
Just got to do a background

100
00:09:01,124 --> 00:09:01,499
check.

101
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:02,459
It takes five minutes.

102
00:09:02,667 --> 00:09:03,463
Oh.

103
00:09:03,668 --> 00:09:05,921
Uh, didn't ever kill anyone,

104
00:09:06,129 --> 00:09:07,129
did you?

105
00:09:08,882 --> 00:09:09,383
No.

106
00:09:09,591 --> 00:09:10,888
You just fill out these

107
00:09:11,092 --> 00:09:11,342
forms.

108
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:13,428
I'll get you rung up down here.

109
00:09:13,636 --> 00:09:15,638
Okey-dokey.

110
00:09:44,876 --> 00:09:47,345
See you later, Janice.

111
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:22,247
Mrs.Trimble.

112
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:22,956
Uh, yes.

113
00:10:23,164 --> 00:10:24,632
I was saying I wanted to

114
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:26,005
thank you and your son for

115
00:10:26,209 --> 00:10:27,426
coming down here today.

116
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:28,048
Uh-huh.

117
00:10:28,253 --> 00:10:29,755
I think we can all agree we'd

118
00:10:29,963 --> 00:10:31,556
like to put this whole ordeal

119
00:10:31,756 --> 00:10:32,803
behind us as quickly and

120
00:10:33,007 --> 00:10:35,430
painlessly as possible.

121
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:37,433
After an extensive review of the

122
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:39,230
police report, as well as

123
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:41,057
ms. Alexander's deposition, we

124
00:10:41,266 --> 00:10:43,018
have come up with terms that we

125
00:10:43,226 --> 00:10:44,603
feel are both fair and

126
00:10:44,811 --> 00:10:46,188
beneficial for all parties

127
00:10:46,396 --> 00:10:47,022
concerned.

128
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:49,028
It is clear ms. Alexander has

129
00:10:49,232 --> 00:10:51,075
feelings for your son, despite

130
00:10:51,276 --> 00:10:53,244
his terrible actions, and is

131
00:10:53,444 --> 00:10:55,037
truly concerned for his

132
00:10:55,238 --> 00:10:55,864
well-being.

133
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:57,699
Therefore, the state would be

134
00:10:57,907 --> 00:10:59,454
willing to drop all criminal

135
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:01,377
charges on the condition he

136
00:11:01,578 --> 00:11:02,875
undergo a full psychiatric

137
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:04,456
evaluation at the state

138
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:06,132
hospital, the result of which

139
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:07,709
would determine the type of

140
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:09,339
therapy he requires and,

141
00:11:09,544 --> 00:11:11,046
ultimately, the possible need

142
00:11:11,254 --> 00:11:14,303
for long-term inpatient care.

143
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:15,747
I will tell you that I have had

144
00:11:15,884 --> 00:11:16,931
a brief discussion with

145
00:11:17,135 --> 00:11:18,136
Dr.Khamis at the state

146
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:19,544
hospital, and he's informed me

147
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,181
that based on past patients with

148
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:22,982
your son's condition, most have

149
00:11:23,183 --> 00:11:24,651
required a minimum therapeutic

150
00:11:24,851 --> 00:11:27,400
rehabilitation of three to five years.

151
00:11:27,604 --> 00:11:29,606
Of course, some can take longer.

152
00:11:29,814 --> 00:11:31,942
Others even become permanent residents.

153
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:33,447
It all just depends on

154
00:11:33,651 --> 00:11:35,824
individual progress.

155
00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:38,873
This is the only offer I will be
presenting to the judge.

156
00:11:39,073 --> 00:11:40,495
I'm confident that he will agree

157
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,168
that your son is a threat to

158
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:43,540
both himself and others.

159
00:11:43,745 --> 00:11:45,713
Therefore, an evaluation of this

160
00:11:45,914 --> 00:11:47,416
kind is not only recommended,

161
00:11:47,624 --> 00:11:50,252
but it will be deemed mandatory.

162
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:51,632
We will step out now and give

163
00:11:51,836 --> 00:11:56,836
you a moment to confer with your counsel.

164
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:13,658
Well?

165
00:12:19,906 --> 00:12:27,906
I will not let them put my
son in a crazy-people hospital.

166
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:30,712
Is there something else you can say?

167
00:12:30,917 --> 00:12:33,511
Something you can do?

168
00:12:33,711 --> 00:12:37,215
What would you like me to say?

169
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:40,597
That he didn't do it.

170
00:12:40,802 --> 00:12:43,351
That they're wrong.

171
00:12:43,554 --> 00:12:46,228
That that little...

172
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:50,778
That girl is lying.

173
00:12:50,979 --> 00:12:54,574
Mrs.Trimble, we have to look
at the facts, and what the facts

174
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:57,027
are saying is that we can't win this case.

175
00:12:57,235 --> 00:13:00,159
The evidence against Jakob is considerable.

176
00:13:00,363 --> 00:13:05,415
She has his skin underneath her
fingernails, scratch marks on

177
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:11,751
his chest, bruises, traces of
his semen found inside of her.

178
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:16,304
Your son has a disability that makes
him prone to random acts of aggression.

179
00:13:16,504 --> 00:13:18,802
Now, it's her word against his,

180
00:13:19,007 --> 00:13:21,351
and he can't speak.

181
00:13:21,551 --> 00:13:27,399
I don't...I don't care.

182
00:13:27,598 --> 00:13:30,351
He didn't do it!

183
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,688
I know my boy would never do that.

184
00:13:32,895 --> 00:13:34,613
And I will not let them put him

185
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:37,784
in a place with...for people
like that.

186
00:13:37,984 --> 00:13:39,952
No!

187
00:13:40,153 --> 00:13:43,077
Well, it's not your decision.

188
00:13:43,281 --> 00:13:44,954
Your boy is not a minor...he's
an adult.

189
00:13:45,158 --> 00:13:46,158
He can be tried as one.

190
00:13:46,242 --> 00:13:51,715
I am his court-appointed
attorney, not yours.

191
00:13:51,914 --> 00:13:54,793
I have to look out for his best interests.

192
00:13:55,001 --> 00:14:00,474
And it's...it's my professional
opinion that...this is our best

193
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:03,142
course of action.

194
00:14:03,343 --> 00:14:08,065
Oh, god.

195
00:14:08,264 --> 00:14:10,312
I don't need your permission.

196
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:14,111
I'm sorry, but I am going to
agree to these terms.

197
00:14:14,312 --> 00:14:17,816
It's OK.

198
00:14:18,024 --> 00:14:20,903
It's OK, Jakob.

199
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:23,329
It's OK.

200
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:26,248
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh,

201
00:14:26,449 --> 00:14:27,792
shh, shh, shh, shh.

202
00:14:35,917 --> 00:14:41,515
Oh, god.

203
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:47,642
Jakob.

204
00:14:47,845 --> 00:14:50,644
Oh, baby. Jakob!

205
00:14:50,848 --> 00:14:52,850
I love you!

206
00:14:57,814 --> 00:14:59,908
Let him go.

207
00:15:00,108 --> 00:15:02,952
He doesn't like to be touched.

208
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:08,033
He doesn't like to be touched!

209
00:15:08,241 --> 00:15:12,872
I love you! I love you, Jakob!

210
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:16,333
I love you.

211
00:15:16,541 --> 00:15:20,387
Oh, no!

212
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:23,135
Oh, my...

213
00:15:35,101 --> 00:15:38,605
Oh.

214
00:15:39,647 --> 00:15:40,068
Hello?

215
00:15:40,273 --> 00:15:41,820
Janice, it's me.

216
00:15:42,024 --> 00:15:43,024
Oh, Charles.

217
00:15:43,151 --> 00:15:45,779
You're not still at home, are you?

218
00:15:45,987 --> 00:15:48,831
I mean, I have to be in the prosecutor's office in

219
00:15:49,031 --> 00:15:50,031
...in less than an hour.

220
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:51,826
Yeah. I'm sorry, um, but I

221
00:15:52,034 --> 00:15:55,504
don't think I'm gonna be able to drive you today.

222
00:15:55,705 --> 00:15:59,460
What? Why?

223
00:15:59,667 --> 00:16:01,340
Charles, I don't think I can...

224
00:16:01,544 --> 00:16:02,966
I can do this by myself.

225
00:16:03,171 --> 00:16:05,890
Yeah, uh, I'm sorry.
W-what I'm saying is...I...I

226
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:12,097
don't think I'm gonna be able to
come around anymore...at all.

227
00:16:12,305 --> 00:16:15,809
Look...I...I know this isn't the
best time.

228
00:16:16,017 --> 00:16:18,861
I've been married twice, and I got my own kids.

229
00:16:19,061 --> 00:16:20,813
They've all grown up one way or

230
00:16:21,022 --> 00:16:24,026
the other, and I'm done with all that.

231
00:16:24,233 --> 00:16:29,330
I just...I can't deal with
another, not at my age.

232
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:34,707
I don't want to, especially one with so much...

233
00:16:34,911 --> 00:16:35,662
Aw, hell.

234
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:37,998
You don't mean...you don't

235
00:16:38,206 --> 00:16:41,176
mean that, do you, Charles?

236
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:42,376
Charles, I can't believe

237
00:16:42,585 --> 00:16:43,928
you're...you're saying this to

238
00:16:44,128 --> 00:16:45,721
me right now.
I mean, you just can't.

239
00:16:45,922 --> 00:16:48,300
Well, there's no difference
if it happened now or later.

240
00:16:48,508 --> 00:16:51,102
I think we both know that this wasn't gonna last.

241
00:16:51,302 --> 00:16:54,806
Let's just be happy we had some
good times together.

242
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:57,062
Oh, Charles, now, please.

243
00:16:57,266 --> 00:16:57,858
I...I

244
00:16:58,059 --> 00:16:59,151
now, I got to go.

245
00:16:59,352 --> 00:17:01,821
Charles.
You take care there.

246
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:04,149
Charles.

247
00:17:04,357 --> 00:17:06,359
Charles?!

248
00:17:06,567 --> 00:17:09,446
Charles, wait!

249
00:17:09,654 --> 00:17:11,748
Charles!!

250
00:17:11,948 --> 00:17:12,948
Aah!

251
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:27,551
Jakob.

252
00:17:27,755 --> 00:17:30,178
Jakob, get away from the window.

253
00:17:30,383 --> 00:17:33,512
Get away from the window, Jake.

254
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:35,437
We have to...come help me with
the bag.

255
00:17:35,638 --> 00:17:38,061
We have to go.

256
00:17:38,266 --> 00:17:40,985
Jakob, come on.
Help me with the bag.

257
00:17:41,185 --> 00:17:42,937
We have to get going.

258
00:17:43,145 --> 00:17:44,692
It's time to go.

259
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:49,073
Oh, Jakob.

260
00:17:49,277 --> 00:17:55,250
Come on, Jakob.
Jakob, come on. Let's go.

261
00:17:55,449 --> 00:17:57,042
Come on, son!

262
00:17:57,243 --> 00:18:04,047
Look at mommy. Let's go.

263
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:09,848
Jakob.

264
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:11,890
Jakob!

265
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:15,516
It's your mother calling you.
Come on!

266
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:18,269
We have to go.

267
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:33,412
Um...

268
00:18:33,613 --> 00:18:40,212
Can I help you?

269
00:18:40,411 --> 00:18:44,086
It's OK.

270
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:46,543
It's oh...you're OK.

271
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:57,224
You'll be fine, Jakob.

272
00:18:57,428 --> 00:18:59,647
Jakob.

273
00:19:24,372 --> 00:19:29,003
Here you go.

274
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:32,464
Thanks for lunch.
It was really nice.

275
00:19:32,672 --> 00:19:38,350
You're welcome.

276
00:19:38,552 --> 00:19:40,179
Wouldn't you like to come in

277
00:19:40,388 --> 00:19:42,061
for a few minutes?

278
00:19:42,264 --> 00:19:44,062
Um...

279
00:19:44,266 --> 00:19:45,688
You know what?

280
00:19:45,893 --> 00:19:48,521
I better not.
I got a lot of things I got to

281
00:19:48,729 --> 00:19:49,446
get done today.

282
00:19:49,647 --> 00:19:54,153
Mm-hmm.
Well, thanks.

283
00:19:59,323 --> 00:20:02,293
Oh!

284
00:20:02,493 --> 00:20:04,746
Oh! What is it, Paige?
What happened?

285
00:20:04,954 --> 00:20:05,955
Don't touch me!

286
00:20:06,163 --> 00:20:08,211
Oh! Jakob!

287
00:20:08,416 --> 00:20:11,044
Oh, my god! Jakob!

288
00:20:11,252 --> 00:20:13,755
Jakob. Jakob?

289
00:20:13,963 --> 00:20:15,010
Jakob, where are you?

290
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:16,761
Jakob. Jakob!

291
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:20,686
Jake! Oh, my baby!

292
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:22,138
My baby. Oh.

293
00:20:22,346 --> 00:20:24,144
Aah!

294
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:30,063
Shh. Oh. Oh, my baby.

295
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:33,190
OK, I'll be right out with

296
00:20:33,399 --> 00:20:38,200
that.

297
00:20:38,404 --> 00:20:39,826
Y'all still working on these?

298
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:40,781
No, go ahead.

299
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:41,990
No. Thank you.

300
00:20:42,032 --> 00:20:43,033
So, how was everything?

301
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:46,041
Well, it was very good.
I just love that chicken salad.

302
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:48,623
Oh, yeah, it's one of my favorites, too.

303
00:20:48,831 --> 00:20:49,878
Any dessert today?

304
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:51,334
Well, I was kind of...

305
00:20:51,542 --> 00:20:52,634
No, that's OK.

306
00:20:52,835 --> 00:20:56,135
I was kind of eying that
chocolate cake over there.

307
00:20:56,338 --> 00:20:58,887
Maybe we could share it.

308
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:00,091
Chocolate cake?

309
00:21:00,217 --> 00:21:02,060
Are you sure nothing for you, hon?

310
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:02,511
Yeah.

311
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:03,221
All right.

312
00:21:03,429 --> 00:21:11,155
I'll be right back with that.
Thank you.

313
00:21:11,353 --> 00:21:12,070
You OK?

314
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:14,615
You've been awful quiet over there today.

315
00:21:14,815 --> 00:21:17,113
Oh, no, I'm - I'm fine.

316
00:21:17,318 --> 00:21:19,867
I just...I was hungry, I guess,

317
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:24,291
and...well, I...I don't know.

318
00:21:24,492 --> 00:21:26,165
Um...

319
00:21:26,368 --> 00:21:27,415
Eh, never mind.

320
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:29,088
You sure?

321
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:31,131
Yeah, yeah.
Nothing to worry about.

322
00:21:31,332 --> 00:21:33,710
OK.

323
00:21:33,918 --> 00:21:35,170
Well, I'd just like to say

324
00:21:35,377 --> 00:21:39,257
thanks again for yet another great meal.

325
00:21:39,465 --> 00:21:41,263
And I was thinking that maybe...

326
00:21:41,467 --> 00:21:42,263
Hold the thought.

327
00:21:42,468 --> 00:21:50,468
I...the little boys' room is
calling.

328
00:21:51,352 --> 00:21:54,151
Here you go.

329
00:21:54,355 --> 00:21:55,481
Enjoy.

330
00:21:55,689 --> 00:21:58,613
Thank you. It looks good.

331
00:22:09,495 --> 00:22:11,668
Mmm.

332
00:22:11,872 --> 00:22:15,046
Mmm. Try some.
Nah.

333
00:22:15,251 --> 00:22:18,425
All right, Janice...

334
00:22:18,629 --> 00:22:21,303
I'm gonna ask you something.

335
00:22:21,507 --> 00:22:24,056
Now, I hope you don't take this the wrong way.

336
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:28,561
OK. OK.

337
00:22:28,764 --> 00:22:33,315
Have you ever given any
thought...to the idea of maybe

338
00:22:33,519 --> 00:22:36,773
putting Jakob into some kind of...I don't know

339
00:22:36,981 --> 00:22:39,200
...care facility?

340
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:41,573
Why would you ever ask me something like that?

341
00:22:41,777 --> 00:22:43,199
Well, I know it can't be easy

342
00:22:43,404 --> 00:22:45,077
on you having someone like that around.

343
00:22:45,281 --> 00:22:47,704
"Someone like that"?

344
00:22:47,908 --> 00:22:48,374
He's my son.

345
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:51,250
Yeah, and before you know it,
he's gonna be 30 years old.

346
00:22:51,453 --> 00:22:52,796
I mean, how long do you think

347
00:22:52,997 --> 00:22:54,840
you can keep it up, taking care of him?

348
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,212
As long as he needs me.

349
00:22:56,417 --> 00:22:59,762
That's exactly what I'm getting at.

350
00:22:59,962 --> 00:23:02,306
He's gonna need you forever.

351
00:23:02,506 --> 00:23:06,227
And I just thought, wouldn't it

352
00:23:06,427 --> 00:23:07,849
be easier to...

353
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:12,854
It's not about being easier.

354
00:23:13,058 --> 00:23:14,355
I don't think I want to talk

355
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:15,561
about this anymore.

356
00:23:15,769 --> 00:23:18,318
That's fair enough.

357
00:23:18,522 --> 00:23:19,273
He's your boy.

358
00:23:19,481 --> 00:23:24,408
He's my boy.

359
00:23:24,612 --> 00:23:26,330
Try the cake.
How is it?

360
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:34,210
It's pretty good.
It's pretty good.

361
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:38,589
You look really nice, honey.

362
00:23:38,792 --> 00:23:43,093
You're gonna be meeting mommy's
new friend tonight.

363
00:23:43,297 --> 00:23:46,392
So...let's try to have a good

364
00:23:46,592 --> 00:23:49,266
time, OK, Jakob?

365
00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:51,222
OK?

366
00:24:09,490 --> 00:24:12,539
Oh. That's him.

367
00:24:12,743 --> 00:24:14,336
Oh. Oh, come on.

368
00:24:14,536 --> 00:24:15,753
Come on, Jakob.

369
00:24:15,955 --> 00:24:17,457
Shh. It's good.

370
00:24:17,665 --> 00:24:19,383
Sit down over here.

371
00:24:19,583 --> 00:24:21,301
It's mommy's friend. OK.

372
00:24:22,878 --> 00:24:27,930
Just a sec.

373
00:24:28,133 --> 00:24:28,725
Hey, there.

374
00:24:28,926 --> 00:24:30,928
Hi.

375
00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:32,433
Come on in. Come in.

376
00:24:32,638 --> 00:24:34,481
Oh, I finally get to see your

377
00:24:34,682 --> 00:24:36,275
house on the inside.

378
00:24:36,475 --> 00:24:40,446
It's nice.
It's homey.

379
00:24:40,646 --> 00:24:41,818
And this must be Jakob.

380
00:24:42,022 --> 00:24:43,399
How you doing there, buddy?

381
00:24:43,607 --> 00:24:45,075
Did your mom tell you that I got

382
00:24:45,275 --> 00:24:46,367
a boy about your same age?

383
00:24:49,405 --> 00:24:51,078
So, he really doesn't say

384
00:24:51,281 --> 00:24:52,874
anything ever?

385
00:24:53,075 --> 00:24:55,373
No.
Well, what does he...what

386
00:24:55,577 --> 00:24:56,203
does he do?

387
00:24:56,412 --> 00:24:57,412
Does he do anything?

388
00:24:57,579 --> 00:25:03,461
Charles.
Shit, I don't know.

389
00:25:03,669 --> 00:25:06,047
Uh, he's a good boy.

390
00:25:06,255 --> 00:25:08,849
He's just...

391
00:25:09,049 --> 00:25:10,471
He's a - he's a good boy.

392
00:25:10,676 --> 00:25:12,474
Well, regardless, it's...

393
00:25:12,678 --> 00:25:16,148
It's good to finally meet you, Jakob.

394
00:25:22,146 --> 00:25:23,648
He doesn't really like being touched.

395
00:25:23,856 --> 00:25:25,358
Yeah, well, that makes two of us.

396
00:25:25,566 --> 00:25:27,489
Uh, would you like some coffee?

397
00:25:27,693 --> 00:25:29,445
I have some made up in the kitchen.

398
00:25:29,653 --> 00:25:31,030
I'd love some. Black, please.

399
00:25:31,238 --> 00:25:32,581
OK. Just have a seat there.

400
00:25:32,781 --> 00:25:37,781
Um, you two can get better acquainted.

401
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:06,230
Oh. Here you go.

402
00:26:06,273 --> 00:26:07,024
Oh, thanks.

403
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:09,109
How are you two getting along?

404
00:26:09,318 --> 00:26:11,741
Oh, just fine.
In fact, I was just getting

405
00:26:11,945 --> 00:26:15,074
ready to tell Jake here about
the time, uh, my buddy Rico

406
00:26:15,282 --> 00:26:18,286
flipped his 18-wheeler on
interstate 80 back in '91.

407
00:26:18,494 --> 00:26:21,122
Oh! That sounds fun.

408
00:26:21,330 --> 00:26:24,425
Yeah, um...I was about 5

409
00:26:24,625 --> 00:26:26,969
miles out from the accident when

410
00:26:27,169 --> 00:26:28,512
I get an alert on my C.B. from

411
00:26:28,712 --> 00:26:31,056
another driver who saw the whole
thing in his rear-view.

412
00:26:31,256 --> 00:26:31,427
Ooh.

413
00:26:31,632 --> 00:26:34,101
So, I get there.
I'm the first on the scene.

414
00:26:34,301 --> 00:26:36,474
And, you know, his trailer was demolished.

415
00:26:36,678 --> 00:26:39,557
His load...about 25 cattle...
Scattered around everywhere,

416
00:26:39,765 --> 00:26:42,609
some of them dead, some of them alive and

417
00:26:42,810 --> 00:26:43,527
wandering off up into the hills.

418
00:26:43,727 --> 00:26:46,401
There was this one poor heifer.
Listen to this.

419
00:26:46,605 --> 00:26:47,697
She got it the worst.

420
00:26:47,898 --> 00:26:51,948
You know, she had four broken
legs, no skin on one side of her

421
00:26:52,152 --> 00:26:55,952
body, and I'm sure all kinds of
damage on the inside.

422
00:26:56,156 --> 00:26:58,009
She's just howling and screaming something awful.

423
00:26:58,033 --> 00:26:59,410
Jake.

424
00:26:59,618 --> 00:27:03,168
Well, this state trooper
shows up, and he's a young guy,

425
00:27:03,372 --> 00:27:05,591
rookie.
He decides he's gonna put the

426
00:27:05,791 --> 00:27:09,011
beast down, you know, put it out of its pain.

427
00:27:09,211 --> 00:27:11,555
So he takes out his gun.

428
00:27:11,755 --> 00:27:14,599
He puts it right between that heifer's eyes.

429
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:15,847
Pow!

430
00:27:16,051 --> 00:27:17,849
Oh-
yeah.

431
00:27:18,053 --> 00:27:19,600
I'm not shitting you, this

432
00:27:19,805 --> 00:27:21,432
sucker was still alive.

433
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:22,640
Shh, shh, shh.

434
00:27:22,766 --> 00:27:24,518
So he shoots it again.

435
00:27:24,726 --> 00:27:25,726
Bam! And again...bam!

436
00:27:25,769 --> 00:27:26,769
Charles, Charles.

437
00:27:26,937 --> 00:27:30,237
And the thing's rolling around
on the ground and screaming.

438
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:32,693
So he shoots it again and again and again.

439
00:27:32,901 --> 00:27:35,120
And the thing is still god damn alive.

440
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:36,947
So you know what this stupid son

441
00:27:37,156 --> 00:27:38,156
of a bitch does?

442
00:27:38,198 --> 00:27:40,200
He takes this great big fucking...

443
00:27:42,828 --> 00:27:44,876
Jakob! Jakob! Jakob!
Are you OK?!

444
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:46,582
Where is your bathroom?

445
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:49,634
Upstairs. Jakob! Oh, baby!

446
00:27:49,835 --> 00:27:52,463
OK, OK!
Come on, honey, let me do that.

447
00:27:52,671 --> 00:27:53,671
Let mommy help you.

448
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:58,094
Oh, it's OK.
It's...oh, I'm sorry.

449
00:27:59,678 --> 00:28:01,396
Is he gonna be OK?

450
00:28:01,597 --> 00:28:03,520
Um, yeah, it's just a...it's
just a small burn.

451
00:28:03,724 --> 00:28:05,118
I...I just need to get it cleaned
up.

452
00:28:05,142 --> 00:28:06,742
Janice, you've got your hands full here.

453
00:28:06,935 --> 00:28:08,935
We'll just do this another time.
Oh, no, no, no.

454
00:28:09,062 --> 00:28:10,985
The caregiver...she'll be here
any minute now.

455
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:12,550
Janice, I'm covered in hot coffee,

456
00:28:12,691 --> 00:28:14,489
and he's going fucking ape-shit.

457
00:28:14,693 --> 00:28:15,693
We'll do it another time.

458
00:28:15,736 --> 00:28:17,363
Well, when?

459
00:28:17,571 --> 00:28:19,573
I don't know.
W-we'll do lunch this week.

460
00:28:19,781 --> 00:28:21,658
I'll call you.

461
00:28:21,867 --> 00:28:22,914
OK, call me.

462
00:28:23,118 --> 00:28:25,667
I'm just gonna let myself out.

463
00:28:25,871 --> 00:28:29,125
Call me, Charles!

464
00:28:29,333 --> 00:28:31,256
It's OK! It's OK!

465
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:33,428
Jakob! Damn it, stop it!

466
00:28:33,629 --> 00:28:34,721
Just stop that!

467
00:28:34,922 --> 00:28:38,096
Can't you see I'm trying to help you?

468
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:39,927
What is wrong with you?!

469
00:28:40,135 --> 00:28:45,642
Why do you always fuck things up?

470
00:28:45,849 --> 00:28:48,978
Oh, come here.
Get over here. Come over here.

471
00:28:49,186 --> 00:28:51,439
Oh, baby.

472
00:28:51,647 --> 00:28:52,739
Oh, you're hurt.

473
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:55,159
It's OK, though. It's OK.

474
00:28:55,359 --> 00:28:57,578
Mommy's gonna make it better.

475
00:28:57,778 --> 00:28:59,746
Mommy's gonna make it better,

476
00:28:59,947 --> 00:29:02,621
Jakey.
No, no, no, no, babe.

477
00:29:02,824 --> 00:29:05,043
There, there. It's gonna be OK, Jakob.

478
00:29:05,244 --> 00:29:07,542
Look at mommy.
It's gonna be OK, Jakob.

479
00:29:07,746 --> 00:29:12,877
Look at mommy.
It's gonna be OK.

480
00:29:13,085 --> 00:29:16,555
It's OK.

481
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:22,644
Oh, Jakob.

482
00:29:22,844 --> 00:29:26,565
I'm so sorry.

483
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:32,022
I know you...I know it wasn't
your fault.

484
00:29:32,229 --> 00:29:37,861
I just wanted tonight to go better.

485
00:29:42,447 --> 00:29:44,620
Oh.

486
00:30:22,362 --> 00:30:23,659
Give me that.

487
00:30:23,864 --> 00:30:27,209
No.
It's my turn.

488
00:30:27,409 --> 00:30:31,710
Come on.

489
00:30:31,913 --> 00:30:33,961
There you go.

490
00:31:00,859 --> 00:31:03,658
Stop it. Ja...Jakob. Jakob.

491
00:31:03,862 --> 00:31:04,862
Jakob. Jakob.

492
00:31:04,988 --> 00:31:06,090
Quit it. Come on.
Jakob. Wake up.

493
00:31:06,114 --> 00:31:07,912
Jakob, quit it.
Quit it.

494
00:31:08,116 --> 00:31:09,584
Jakob.
Wake up.

495
00:31:09,785 --> 00:31:12,584
Jakob.
Jakob.

496
00:31:12,788 --> 00:31:14,882
Jakob.

497
00:31:15,082 --> 00:31:17,835
Jakob.

498
00:31:18,043 --> 00:31:20,421
Jakob, can you hear anything?

499
00:31:20,629 --> 00:31:25,100
Jakob. Can you hear us?

500
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:28,474
Jakob.
Keep breathing for me.

501
00:31:28,678 --> 00:31:33,058
Keep breathing.

502
00:31:33,266 --> 00:31:37,942
Jakob, can you hear us?

503
00:31:38,146 --> 00:31:43,698
Keep breathing for me.
Keep breathing, Jakob.

504
00:31:43,902 --> 00:31:47,281
Keep breathing.

505
00:31:47,489 --> 00:31:48,706
Hang in there, Jakob.

506
00:31:48,907 --> 00:31:52,286
Just keep breathing for us, OK?

507
00:31:52,494 --> 00:31:58,342
Keep breathing.

508
00:33:56,868 --> 00:34:00,964
Jakob.

509
00:34:01,164 --> 00:34:05,465
Jakob.

510
00:34:05,669 --> 00:34:10,049
Oh, Jakob.

511
00:34:10,257 --> 00:34:14,262
It...it's your mother.

512
00:34:14,469 --> 00:34:16,892
You're OK.

513
00:34:17,097 --> 00:34:19,270
Jakob!

514
00:34:19,474 --> 00:34:22,068
Somebody! Jakob!

515
00:34:22,269 --> 00:34:24,863
Somebody help! It's...

516
00:34:25,063 --> 00:34:27,316
Jakob?

517
00:34:27,524 --> 00:34:29,697
Jakob, are you with me?

518
00:34:29,901 --> 00:34:32,905
Jakob.

519
00:34:33,113 --> 00:34:35,036
Jakob, it says here that you cannot speak.

520
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:37,709
Is that correct?

521
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:40,879
I guess so.

522
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:42,547
Let me put it in a different way.

523
00:34:42,747 --> 00:34:44,044
Is there any way that you can

524
00:34:44,249 --> 00:34:46,001
convey to me why you think it is

525
00:34:46,209 --> 00:34:48,553
that you cannot speak?

526
00:34:48,753 --> 00:34:51,302
Jakob.

527
00:34:51,506 --> 00:34:54,806
You know, I'm pretty familiar
with your condition, and I'm

528
00:34:55,010 --> 00:34:59,060
fairly certain that you can understand me.

529
00:34:59,264 --> 00:35:02,894
So, look, Jakob, you're here for
an evaluation so that we may

530
00:35:03,101 --> 00:35:05,775
determine the type of care that you require.

531
00:35:05,979 --> 00:35:07,777
Now, in order to do that, I need

532
00:35:07,981 --> 00:35:10,951
you to participate to the best of your abilities.

533
00:35:11,151 --> 00:35:14,951
Jakob. Hey, Jakob. Hey, buddy.

534
00:35:15,155 --> 00:35:19,581
What this means is...I want you
to listen and try to perform a

535
00:35:19,784 --> 00:35:22,583
few tasks to the best of your ability.

536
00:35:22,787 --> 00:35:25,006
We'll just start at the bottom

537
00:35:25,206 --> 00:35:27,174
and we'll work our way up.

538
00:35:27,375 --> 00:35:32,757
Now, what I have here is a
simple puzzle which, when put

539
00:35:32,964 --> 00:35:36,389
together correctly, creates a shape.

540
00:35:36,593 --> 00:35:39,096
What do you think?

541
00:35:39,304 --> 00:35:41,477
Jakob. Pay attention now.

542
00:35:41,681 --> 00:35:42,022
Jakob.

543
00:35:42,223 --> 00:35:47,775
Jakob, you want to try and put
these pieces together?

544
00:35:47,979 --> 00:35:50,073
Jakob, it's OK.

545
00:35:50,273 --> 00:35:52,492
Can you just try?

546
00:35:59,324 --> 00:36:04,080
Jakob, mommy asked you a question.

547
00:36:04,287 --> 00:36:07,962
Jakob. Jakob?

548
00:36:08,166 --> 00:36:13,764
I'm talking to you.

549
00:36:13,963 --> 00:36:17,638
I just need someone to come over
a few days a week, keep him busy

550
00:36:17,842 --> 00:36:19,970
so I can have some time to myself.

551
00:36:20,178 --> 00:36:23,148
Do you think that's something
that you could handle?

552
00:36:23,348 --> 00:36:25,771
Yes, I think so.

553
00:36:25,975 --> 00:36:27,977
Do you mind if I ask what's...

554
00:36:28,186 --> 00:36:32,191
What his condition is?

555
00:36:32,399 --> 00:36:34,276
Um, he fucks things up.

556
00:36:34,484 --> 00:36:36,407
He always fucks things up.

557
00:36:36,611 --> 00:36:38,784
Jakob! Don't you run away
from me, boy!

558
00:36:38,988 --> 00:36:40,581
You hear me?!
Daniel, please.

559
00:36:40,782 --> 00:36:42,830
Don't you fucking go near him, woman!

560
00:36:43,034 --> 00:36:44,411
Daniel, please don't hit him.

561
00:36:44,619 --> 00:36:46,166
You know he can't help himself.

562
00:36:46,371 --> 00:36:48,214
I'm so sick of hearing that shit!

563
00:36:48,415 --> 00:36:50,088
I'm sick of all of this shit!

564
00:36:50,291 --> 00:36:53,010
Not my son.
My son could talk and my son was

565
00:36:53,211 --> 00:36:55,589
normal, not some freakin' mute retard!

566
00:36:55,797 --> 00:36:57,140
Talk, god damn it! Talk!

567
00:36:57,340 --> 00:36:58,432
No, he can't, Daniel.

568
00:36:58,633 --> 00:36:59,634
Daniel, Daniel!

569
00:36:59,843 --> 00:37:01,345
Bullshit he can't! He won't!

570
00:37:01,553 --> 00:37:02,349
Stop it!

571
00:37:02,554 --> 00:37:04,227
Oh, he's gonna talk, all right.

572
00:37:04,431 --> 00:37:05,432
Stop it!

573
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:07,118
Don't you go near him or I'll
knock your fucking teeth in!

574
00:37:07,142 --> 00:37:08,142
You stop it!

575
00:37:08,226 --> 00:37:09,728
You're gonna say something!

576
00:37:09,936 --> 00:37:11,028
Oh! Oh, my god!

577
00:37:11,229 --> 00:37:13,277
Oh, Jake. Jakey, are you OK?

578
00:37:13,481 --> 00:37:16,280
Come on, sweetheart.
It's...it's OK.

579
00:37:16,484 --> 00:37:18,202
Shh, shh, shh. Don't worry.

580
00:37:18,403 --> 00:37:20,121
Come on. Jakob, it's all right.

581
00:37:20,321 --> 00:37:23,120
Come on, I just need to get
you...wash it off.

582
00:37:23,324 --> 00:37:25,076
Come on, Jake.

583
00:38:37,607 --> 00:38:39,860
It's OK.

584
00:38:40,068 --> 00:38:42,912
It's really good.

585
00:38:43,112 --> 00:38:46,082
Shh.

586
00:38:50,203 --> 00:38:53,173
That's it.
I'm not gonna hurt you, OK?

587
00:38:53,373 --> 00:38:54,966
I'm gonna hurt you.

588
00:39:29,117 --> 00:39:30,117
Hello?

589
00:39:30,159 --> 00:39:32,503
Um, hi. Is this ms.Trimble?

590
00:39:32,704 --> 00:39:34,126
Yes. Who's this?

591
00:39:34,330 --> 00:39:37,334
Hi. My name is, um,
Paige Alexander.

592
00:39:37,542 --> 00:39:39,715
I'm calling about your flier.

593
00:39:39,919 --> 00:39:47,919
Oh, yes. Uh, hi.
Uh, could you hold on a sec?

594
00:39:49,971 --> 00:39:51,518
Uh, OK, hi.

595
00:39:51,723 --> 00:39:56,229
Hi. Is the caregiver position
still available?

596
00:39:56,436 --> 00:39:59,030
Oh, yes. Uh-huh.
Where'd you see the flier?

597
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:00,231
At the school here.

598
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:01,191
Paxton?

599
00:40:01,399 --> 00:40:01,740
Yes.

600
00:40:01,941 --> 00:40:02,442
Uh-huh.

601
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:04,072
Are you a student there?

602
00:40:04,277 --> 00:40:04,778
Uh-huh.

603
00:40:04,986 --> 00:40:05,986
OK, well...

604
00:40:06,487 --> 00:40:08,581
...do you want to come over for
an interview?

605
00:40:08,781 --> 00:40:11,409
Sure. Now?

606
00:40:11,618 --> 00:40:13,291
Yes. Is that a problem?

607
00:40:13,494 --> 00:40:15,963
No. No, it isn't.

608
00:40:16,164 --> 00:40:20,419
Let me get your address.
Hold on.

609
00:40:30,929 --> 00:40:31,350
Hi.

610
00:40:31,554 --> 00:40:32,225
Hi.

611
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:33,431
You Paige?

612
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:34,937
Yes. Hello.

613
00:40:35,141 --> 00:40:36,141
OK.

614
00:40:36,267 --> 00:40:37,735
Um, come on in.

615
00:40:37,936 --> 00:40:41,236
Thanks.

616
00:40:41,439 --> 00:40:45,319
Just come on in here and, oh,

617
00:40:45,526 --> 00:40:46,527
have a seat.

618
00:40:46,736 --> 00:40:47,487
Hello.

619
00:40:47,695 --> 00:40:52,371
Uh, this is my son, Jakob.

620
00:40:52,575 --> 00:40:55,294
Hello, Jakob. I'm Paige.

621
00:40:55,495 --> 00:41:01,923
Um...Jake doesn't speak.

622
00:41:02,126 --> 00:41:04,299
Oh, is this...this is who

623
00:41:04,504 --> 00:41:06,757
you have, um, the flier up for.

624
00:41:06,965 --> 00:41:09,935
Yes. Is that OK?

625
00:41:10,134 --> 00:41:11,260
Yeah, absolutely.

626
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:12,812
I...I just...

627
00:41:13,012 --> 00:41:16,687
...I think I just expected
someone a lot younger or older.

628
00:41:16,891 --> 00:41:20,486
Well, disability has nothing to do with age.

629
00:41:20,687 --> 00:41:23,440
Oh, absolutely. Absolutely.

630
00:41:23,648 --> 00:41:24,274
How old is he?

631
00:41:24,482 --> 00:41:26,029
26. How old are you?

632
00:41:26,234 --> 00:41:27,235
21.

633
00:41:27,443 --> 00:41:28,740
Mm-hmm.

634
00:41:28,945 --> 00:41:31,539
And you say you go to Paxton.

635
00:41:31,739 --> 00:41:35,460
Yes, I do.
I'm a senior there, and I am a

636
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:37,378
sociology major.

637
00:41:37,578 --> 00:41:42,505
Uh-huh. Our last caregiver
went to Paxton.

638
00:41:42,709 --> 00:41:44,757
Oh, did they...they
graduate?

639
00:41:44,961 --> 00:41:45,553
Mnh...mnh.

640
00:41:45,753 --> 00:41:47,005
Just didn't work out.

641
00:41:47,213 --> 00:41:47,509
Oh.

642
00:41:47,714 --> 00:41:50,513
Do you have any experience in
in-home care?

643
00:41:50,717 --> 00:41:53,516
Actually, no, not with
in-home care, but I do have my

644
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:55,814
CNA license.
I do that in the summers.

645
00:41:56,014 --> 00:42:01,020
OK. And why are you
interested in this job now?

646
00:42:01,227 --> 00:42:02,227
Um...

647
00:42:03,354 --> 00:42:05,402
I, uh...I would like to be a

648
00:42:05,606 --> 00:42:07,984
social worker fora
senior-living facility or

649
00:42:08,192 --> 00:42:09,193
possibly a hospital.

650
00:42:09,402 --> 00:42:12,326
And I'm also applying to grad
school, and I think that this

651
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:15,784
experience could be very valuable for me.

652
00:42:15,992 --> 00:42:17,369
Uh-huh. Well, what I'm

653
00:42:17,577 --> 00:42:19,454
looking for is for someone to

654
00:42:19,662 --> 00:42:23,132
come in a few days a week, three
or four hours at a time.

655
00:42:23,332 --> 00:42:27,007
I work part time, and I just
have some things I have to do.

656
00:42:27,211 --> 00:42:31,637
I just need someone to be here
with him, feed him, if it's

657
00:42:31,841 --> 00:42:34,765
nice out, take him outside, if it
gets late, put him to bed,

658
00:42:34,969 --> 00:42:36,471
basically just be here with him

659
00:42:36,679 --> 00:42:40,729
so I can have some time to myself.

660
00:42:40,933 --> 00:42:41,399
OK.

661
00:42:41,601 --> 00:42:45,276
So, do you think this is
something you could handle?

662
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:47,699
Yes.

663
00:42:47,899 --> 00:42:51,494
Um...does anyone else take care
of him?

664
00:42:51,694 --> 00:42:55,369
My sister sometimes, but it's
starting to be too much for her.

665
00:42:55,573 --> 00:42:59,168
Plus, her husband just got laid
off, and they might be moving

666
00:42:59,368 --> 00:43:04,499
to, uh, fort Wayne for more work.

667
00:43:04,707 --> 00:43:07,506
OK.

668
00:43:07,710 --> 00:43:11,556
Do you mind if I ask what is his disability?

669
00:43:11,756 --> 00:43:13,758
He has anoxic brain injury.

670
00:43:13,966 --> 00:43:16,435
It occurs when there's a severe

671
00:43:16,636 --> 00:43:20,311
lack of oxygen to the brain.

672
00:43:20,515 --> 00:43:20,731
Mm.

673
00:43:20,932 --> 00:43:23,435
Jakob had an accident when he was 12.

674
00:43:23,643 --> 00:43:28,069
Hit his head.
He was in a coma for a month.

675
00:43:28,272 --> 00:43:35,451
When he came out, he slowly started to fade away.

676
00:43:35,655 --> 00:43:37,532
I'm sorry. That's terrible.

677
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:41,244
Anyway, I don't think he'll be any trouble.

678
00:43:41,452 --> 00:43:43,705
Like I said, he doesn't speak,

679
00:43:43,913 --> 00:43:47,668
but he seems to understand most things.

680
00:43:47,875 --> 00:43:49,969
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

681
00:43:50,169 --> 00:43:54,174
See?
Mostly, he just sits there, and

682
00:43:54,382 --> 00:43:55,929
he'll do what you tell him.

683
00:43:56,134 --> 00:43:59,513
Just take him out once in a while.

684
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:07,320
He seems to like it outside.

685
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:08,521
Um, OK, great.

686
00:44:08,729 --> 00:44:10,231
When would you like me to start?

687
00:44:10,439 --> 00:44:11,031
Tomorrow.

688
00:44:11,232 --> 00:44:14,406
If that's OK.

689
00:44:14,610 --> 00:44:17,659
I'm pretty ready fora break.

690
00:44:17,864 --> 00:44:18,239
OK.

691
00:44:18,447 --> 00:44:19,573
Well, that sounds great.

692
00:44:19,782 --> 00:44:22,456
I can definitely do that.

693
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:24,037
OK. Thank you, Paige.

694
00:44:24,245 --> 00:44:25,337
Thank you so much.

695
00:44:25,538 --> 00:44:27,586
Bye, Jakob.
I'll see you tomorrow.

696
00:44:27,790 --> 00:44:28,837
OK, I'll take...

697
00:44:29,041 --> 00:44:30,588
Do you need anything else?

698
00:44:30,793 --> 00:44:32,511
No, I'm fine, thank you.

699
00:44:32,712 --> 00:44:38,310
I could use some more coffee, please.

700
00:44:38,509 --> 00:44:41,934
So, what do you know about these people?

701
00:44:42,138 --> 00:44:43,138
What people?

702
00:44:43,181 --> 00:44:45,559
People you're gonna be working for.

703
00:44:45,766 --> 00:44:47,313
Mm...not much.

704
00:44:47,518 --> 00:44:49,520
I just met them yesterday.

705
00:44:49,729 --> 00:44:52,107
Well, what's he like?

706
00:44:52,315 --> 00:44:55,694
He has a brain injury, so he can't talk.

707
00:44:55,902 --> 00:44:59,122
Just seems really innocent.

708
00:44:59,322 --> 00:45:00,323
I don't know, Paige.

709
00:45:00,531 --> 00:45:04,627
I don't understand why you feel
like you have to do this.

710
00:45:04,827 --> 00:45:08,752
Well, I'm gonna have to do it
at some point, considering

711
00:45:08,956 --> 00:45:10,754
that's what I'm going to school for.

712
00:45:10,958 --> 00:45:13,518
And, plus, it'll look really good
on my grad-school application.

713
00:45:15,046 --> 00:45:19,552
I know. It's just...not the best neighborhood.

714
00:45:19,759 --> 00:45:20,555
Mom.

715
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:23,309
All right, I am off.

716
00:45:23,512 --> 00:45:25,480
And what do you think about all this?

717
00:45:25,681 --> 00:45:27,683
She's right.
It'll be a good learning

718
00:45:27,892 --> 00:45:30,611
experience, and, well, it can't
hurt her to make a little money

719
00:45:30,811 --> 00:45:32,563
for next year.
Just be careful.

720
00:45:32,772 --> 00:45:35,321
Don't get too involved, you
know, keep it professional.

721
00:45:35,524 --> 00:45:36,776
Believe it or not, you guys,

722
00:45:36,984 --> 00:45:38,577
I kind of know what I'm doing.

723
00:45:38,778 --> 00:45:39,529
All right.

724
00:45:39,737 --> 00:45:42,661
She knows what she's doing.
We'll see you tonight.

725
00:45:42,865 --> 00:45:44,742
Bye.

726
00:46:33,416 --> 00:46:35,794
Oh, hi. Come on in.

727
00:46:36,002 --> 00:46:41,805
Have to finish getting ready.

728
00:46:42,008 --> 00:46:44,727
Well, you look nice.
Big plans?

729
00:46:44,927 --> 00:46:47,055
Actually, I have a date.

730
00:46:48,431 --> 00:46:49,603
Uh, first date.

731
00:46:49,807 --> 00:46:51,935
Oh, wow. Who's the lucky guy?

732
00:46:52,143 --> 00:46:55,989
Oh, his name is Charles.

733
00:46:56,188 --> 00:46:59,283
I met him in the parking lot where I work.

734
00:46:59,483 --> 00:47:03,454
I backed my car into his shopping cart.

735
00:47:04,530 --> 00:47:07,579
And I guess he liked what he
saw, and he asked me out.

736
00:47:07,783 --> 00:47:08,783
Well, that's great.

737
00:47:08,868 --> 00:47:11,587
I hope you guys have a really good time.

738
00:47:11,787 --> 00:47:15,462
Oh. I hope so, too.

739
00:47:15,666 --> 00:47:21,344
I haven't been out in such a long time.

740
00:47:21,547 --> 00:47:23,641
Is he picking you up?

741
00:47:23,841 --> 00:47:25,889
Yes, any minute now.
Why?

742
00:47:26,093 --> 00:47:28,937
I thought I saw someone parked outside.

743
00:47:29,138 --> 00:47:29,730
What?!

744
00:47:29,930 --> 00:47:32,774
Why didn't you say something?

745
00:47:32,975 --> 00:47:36,070
Oh.

746
00:47:36,270 --> 00:47:38,693
Oh, shit! That's him!

747
00:47:38,898 --> 00:47:41,697
Ooh!

748
00:47:41,901 --> 00:47:43,869
Well, don't worry about anything here.

749
00:47:44,070 --> 00:47:44,741
I'm sure we'll be fine.

750
00:47:44,945 --> 00:47:47,789
OK, uh, he's, um, upstairs

751
00:47:47,990 --> 00:47:50,084
in his bedroom.

752
00:47:50,284 --> 00:47:51,284
I, uh...

753
00:47:51,410 --> 00:47:53,788
OK. Do I look all right?

754
00:47:53,996 --> 00:47:55,714
Good, really good.

755
00:47:55,915 --> 00:47:57,337
OK. Night.

756
00:47:57,541 --> 00:47:59,168
Good luck.

757
00:48:11,889 --> 00:48:13,857
Hi, Jakob.

758
00:48:19,897 --> 00:48:21,991
Are you hungry?

759
00:48:28,572 --> 00:48:29,869
Guess I should have asked your

760
00:48:30,074 --> 00:48:32,577
mom if you like pizza, huh?

761
00:48:38,874 --> 00:48:41,093
Do you want some?

762
00:48:51,011 --> 00:48:53,230
<i>Maybe we should play a game.</i>

763
00:49:08,195 --> 00:49:10,869
<i>Yeah, let's go play a game.</i>

764
00:49:18,122 --> 00:49:21,467
All right.

765
00:49:21,667 --> 00:49:24,841
You want to be yellow?

766
00:49:25,045 --> 00:49:27,969
And then I'll be red, OK?

767
00:49:35,139 --> 00:49:35,765
Let's see.

768
00:49:35,973 --> 00:49:37,566
Did you get all yellow?

769
00:49:37,766 --> 00:49:38,938
Let me see.

770
00:49:39,143 --> 00:49:42,147
Oh, very good.

771
00:49:42,354 --> 00:49:45,073
Here you go.

772
00:49:45,274 --> 00:49:51,828
All right.

773
00:49:52,031 --> 00:49:55,080
All right, so, I'm gonna put in one piece.

774
00:49:55,284 --> 00:50:00,006
No, you're yellow.
I'm red, Jakob, see?

775
00:50:00,206 --> 00:50:02,004
All right, now I'm gonna put in

776
00:50:02,208 --> 00:50:09,842
one piece, and then you're gonna
put in one piece.

777
00:50:10,049 --> 00:50:12,347
OK.

778
00:50:12,551 --> 00:50:14,895
Now, don't let me get four in a row.

779
00:50:15,095 --> 00:50:17,314
I don't want to have four reds

780
00:50:17,515 --> 00:50:19,813
next to each other.

781
00:50:32,112 --> 00:50:34,331
Nice strategy there.

782
00:50:34,532 --> 00:50:36,409
That's pretty good.

783
00:50:43,666 --> 00:50:46,761
All right, well, let's play another round.

784
00:50:51,131 --> 00:50:54,135
You know how? Here.

785
00:51:21,287 --> 00:51:24,040
No. For you.

786
00:51:37,469 --> 00:51:42,350
That's probably way too much.

787
00:52:05,289 --> 00:52:07,041
Done?

788
00:52:15,132 --> 00:52:18,636
All right. There we go.

789
00:52:18,844 --> 00:52:22,098
Sorry.

790
00:52:22,306 --> 00:52:24,354
OK, arms up.

791
00:52:42,368 --> 00:52:43,368
Oh, my god.

792
00:52:44,244 --> 00:52:50,468
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Where'd you get that?

793
00:52:50,668 --> 00:52:52,011
That looks like it hurts.

794
00:52:52,211 --> 00:52:55,090
Here, here. Sorry.

795
00:52:55,297 --> 00:52:57,140
There.

796
00:53:09,019 --> 00:53:12,023
Sorry.

797
00:53:12,231 --> 00:53:14,108
OK.

798
00:53:20,906 --> 00:53:23,534
OK. OK.

799
00:53:31,417 --> 00:53:32,009
Hi.

800
00:53:32,209 --> 00:53:34,052
Hey.

801
00:53:34,253 --> 00:53:35,470
How'd it go?

802
00:53:35,671 --> 00:53:37,514
Great. Just great.

803
00:53:37,715 --> 00:53:39,934
Ah, I really needed that.

804
00:53:40,134 --> 00:53:41,134
Good.

805
00:53:41,176 --> 00:53:42,519
Is he in bed?

806
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:43,186
Yeah.

807
00:53:43,387 --> 00:53:45,230
Yeah, we actually had a really good night.

808
00:53:45,431 --> 00:53:47,934
I ordered pizza, but he didn't
really seem to like it much.

809
00:53:48,142 --> 00:53:50,190
Yeah, he doesn't like pizza real well.

810
00:53:50,394 --> 00:53:52,067
Didn't you use his pecs book?

811
00:53:52,271 --> 00:53:53,271
His what?

812
00:53:53,439 --> 00:53:59,117
This.

813
00:53:59,319 --> 00:54:02,289
You just have him put a picture
of what he wants on the cover so

814
00:54:02,489 --> 00:54:06,244
you know what it is. You
didn't use this at all tonight?

815
00:54:06,452 --> 00:54:08,170
No, I didn't know you had it.

816
00:54:08,370 --> 00:54:10,213
Well, he doesn't speak, honey.

817
00:54:10,414 --> 00:54:12,087
What'd you think we used?

818
00:54:12,291 --> 00:54:17,291
Um, I don't know. But I'll
definitely use it from now on.

819
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:28,020
Um, also, I wanted to let you
know that when I was putting him

820
00:54:28,223 --> 00:54:30,225
to bed, I saw a huge bruise on his side.

821
00:54:30,434 --> 00:54:32,812
Yeah, that boy's always getting banged up.

822
00:54:33,020 --> 00:54:35,114
He doesn't mean to be so
self-destructive.

823
00:54:35,314 --> 00:54:36,406
He just can't help himself.

824
00:54:36,607 --> 00:54:38,325
Nothing to get all worked up about.

825
00:54:38,525 --> 00:54:41,404
All right, well, just wanted
to make sure you were aware.

826
00:54:41,612 --> 00:54:44,115
Well, thank you.

827
00:54:44,323 --> 00:54:45,575
Uh...good night.

828
00:54:45,783 --> 00:54:47,285
See you soon.

829
00:54:47,493 --> 00:54:48,164
Uh-huh.

830
00:54:48,368 --> 00:54:50,041
Good night.

831
00:56:46,695 --> 00:56:48,197
Hey, you are here.

832
00:56:48,405 --> 00:56:48,826
Hey.

833
00:56:49,031 --> 00:56:51,204
I thought you had class today.

834
00:56:51,408 --> 00:56:52,955
Um, it was canceled.

835
00:56:53,160 --> 00:56:54,628
Oh, well, that's nice.

836
00:56:54,828 --> 00:56:57,126
What you working on?

837
00:56:57,331 --> 00:56:59,333
Nothing.
Just some school stuff.

838
00:56:59,541 --> 00:57:00,541
Have you eaten yet?

839
00:57:00,667 --> 00:57:02,294
No, but I have to be at the

840
00:57:02,502 --> 00:57:04,220
Trimbles' in about two hours, so...

841
00:57:04,421 --> 00:57:06,469
Oh, well, it won't take that long.

842
00:57:06,673 --> 00:57:07,925
Let's go have some lunch.

843
00:57:08,133 --> 00:57:09,806
All right, I'll be right down.

844
00:57:10,010 --> 00:57:15,983
OK.

845
00:57:16,183 --> 00:57:17,480
This OK for you?

846
00:57:17,684 --> 00:57:20,437
It's fine.

847
00:57:20,646 --> 00:57:23,240
Jimmy's going to be taking care of you today.

848
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:25,738
Can I get some drinks to start with for you?

849
00:57:25,943 --> 00:57:27,320
I'll have an iced tea.

850
00:57:27,527 --> 00:57:28,119
Iced tea.

851
00:57:28,320 --> 00:57:29,446
Did you want a sweetener?

852
00:57:29,655 --> 00:57:30,451
No.

853
00:57:30,656 --> 00:57:31,452
And you?

854
00:57:31,657 --> 00:57:33,330
Um...diet coke.

855
00:57:33,533 --> 00:57:34,876
Is Pepsi OK?

856
00:57:35,077 --> 00:57:35,578
Sure.

857
00:57:35,786 --> 00:57:36,287
OK.

858
00:57:36,495 --> 00:57:38,213
I'll get those right out.

859
00:57:38,413 --> 00:57:40,461
Thank you.

860
00:57:40,666 --> 00:57:44,796
Well, this is nice. I feel
like I never see you anymore.

861
00:57:45,003 --> 00:57:46,505
Mom, I see you every day.

862
00:57:46,713 --> 00:57:50,388
Well, five minutes in the
morning, five minutes at night.

863
00:57:50,592 --> 00:57:53,971
That's not really seeing each other.

864
00:57:54,179 --> 00:57:57,103
Well, I have school and, um,

865
00:57:57,307 --> 00:57:59,275
a job, so...
I know, I know.

866
00:57:59,476 --> 00:58:02,525
It's just...next thing you know, you'll be

867
00:58:02,729 --> 00:58:06,984
off to grad school.

868
00:58:07,192 --> 00:58:09,695
We gonna talk about this now?

869
00:58:09,903 --> 00:58:12,452
No. No, we're not.

870
00:58:12,656 --> 00:58:15,705
We'll talk about something else.

871
00:58:15,909 --> 00:58:18,662
So, how are things going with, uh, Jakob?

872
00:58:18,870 --> 00:58:21,794
Really good.
Um...it's kind of hard working

873
00:58:21,999 --> 00:58:24,377
with him sometimes because he can't talk.

874
00:58:24,584 --> 00:58:26,461
Sometimes, it's really frustrating.

875
00:58:26,670 --> 00:58:29,514
But I really feel like I'm kind
of connecting with him.

876
00:58:29,715 --> 00:58:31,592
I think it's going really well.

877
00:58:31,800 --> 00:58:33,723
I don't know how you do that.

878
00:58:33,927 --> 00:58:36,350
It takes a special kind of person.

879
00:58:36,555 --> 00:58:42,107
I think you just need patience.

880
00:58:42,310 --> 00:58:46,065
So, what's she like, the mom?

881
00:58:46,273 --> 00:58:48,241
She's really nice.

882
00:58:48,442 --> 00:58:51,742
She's kind of strict, but I

883
00:58:51,945 --> 00:58:53,117
guess you have to be?

884
00:58:53,321 --> 00:58:57,121
She's kind of wrapped up with
this guy that she's seeing right now.

885
00:58:57,325 --> 00:58:57,951
Really?

886
00:58:58,160 --> 00:58:59,878
Is the father around at all?

887
00:59:00,078 --> 00:59:01,421
No.

888
00:59:01,621 --> 00:59:05,046
She hasn't really mentioned it,
either, so I can't ask her about it.

889
00:59:05,250 --> 00:59:06,877
No.

890
00:59:18,388 --> 00:59:21,517
Kind of feel like...

891
00:59:21,725 --> 00:59:25,525
It must be...really hard not

892
00:59:25,729 --> 00:59:29,154
being able to talk to people and
communicate with them.

893
00:59:29,357 --> 00:59:31,985
He must feel really alone.

894
00:59:32,194 --> 00:59:35,698
And he's so vulnerable.

895
00:59:35,906 --> 00:59:41,913
Sometimes, I feel like I'm just
working with a 5-year-old.

896
00:59:42,120 --> 00:59:45,499
And his mom is really nice.

897
00:59:45,707 --> 00:59:49,132
I just feel like...if she was

898
00:59:49,336 --> 00:59:54,092
more patient with him that he would understand.

899
00:59:54,299 --> 00:59:56,927
Sometimes...I probably
shouldn't say anything.

900
00:59:57,135 --> 00:59:59,388
She's so strict with him, you know?

901
00:59:59,596 --> 01:00:00,596
I don't know.

902
01:00:00,722 --> 01:00:05,728
I just wish I could be there
more or do more to help.

903
01:00:05,936 --> 01:00:09,110
Here you go.
Iced tea and a diet Pepsi.

904
01:00:09,314 --> 01:00:11,533
Jimmy should be right with you.

905
01:00:11,733 --> 01:00:15,579
Thank you.

906
01:00:15,779 --> 01:00:20,501
Honey...

907
01:00:20,700 --> 01:00:22,623
This is their lives.

908
01:00:22,828 --> 01:00:26,583
I know you feel like you've
spent some time with them, but

909
01:00:26,790 --> 01:00:34,550
it's only been a few months. You
don't really know these people.

910
01:00:34,756 --> 01:00:36,429
Now, I think your father was right.

911
01:00:36,633 --> 01:00:39,603
I don't think you should get too involved.

912
01:00:39,803 --> 01:00:43,774
Just do your job, get the
experience you need, and then

913
01:00:43,974 --> 01:00:44,974
you'll just move on.

914
01:00:45,058 --> 01:00:46,651
How are you ladies doing today?

915
01:00:46,852 --> 01:00:47,318
Fine.

916
01:00:47,519 --> 01:00:49,863
Sorry to keep you waiting.
Are you ready to order?

917
01:00:50,063 --> 01:00:50,609
Yes.

918
01:00:50,814 --> 01:00:53,192
Yes, I think so.
What can I get for you?

919
01:00:53,400 --> 01:00:55,494
I will have the bolognese.

920
01:00:55,694 --> 01:00:56,694
OK.

921
01:00:56,820 --> 01:00:58,743
And what...what is...

922
01:01:37,903 --> 01:01:40,497
Jakob. Jakob, stop it!
Just stop that!

923
01:01:40,697 --> 01:01:43,246
Can't you see I'm trying to help?!

924
01:01:43,450 --> 01:01:44,918
What is wrong with you?!

925
01:01:45,118 --> 01:01:48,713
Why do you always have to fuck things up?!

926
01:01:48,914 --> 01:01:51,588
Jakob, get over here!

927
01:01:51,791 --> 01:01:53,509
Jakob, get over here!

928
01:01:53,710 --> 01:01:55,804
Get over here!

929
01:02:20,946 --> 01:02:23,745
You're late.
I'm sorry. My class ran over.

930
01:02:23,949 --> 01:02:26,873
OK.
I have to go out for a while.

931
01:02:27,077 --> 01:02:29,250
Get the door, please.

932
01:02:47,597 --> 01:02:52,728
Jakob. Jakob, are you OK?

933
01:02:56,106 --> 01:02:58,905
Jakob, it's me...Paige.

934
01:03:07,617 --> 01:03:09,585
Jakob, it's OK.

935
01:03:09,786 --> 01:03:11,834
It's OK. Shh, shh.

936
01:03:12,038 --> 01:03:13,756
It's me...Paige.

937
01:03:13,957 --> 01:03:15,925
It's me, OK?

938
01:03:16,126 --> 01:03:21,758
It's OK. It's OK.

939
01:03:21,965 --> 01:03:23,763
Come on, let's get up off the

940
01:03:23,967 --> 01:03:27,688
floor, OK?
OK? Come on.

941
01:03:27,887 --> 01:03:31,437
It's OK.

942
01:04:21,858 --> 01:04:24,862
There you go.
You look very handsome.

943
01:04:52,555 --> 01:04:55,809
Jakob...

944
01:04:56,017 --> 01:05:03,401
Jakob, I need you to focus on me, OK?

945
01:05:03,608 --> 01:05:05,610
Is your mom hitting you, Jakob?

946
01:05:05,819 --> 01:05:07,867
Jakob, I need you to look at me,

947
01:05:08,071 --> 01:05:09,163
OK?

948
01:05:09,364 --> 01:05:11,537
I need to know.

949
01:05:11,741 --> 01:05:13,493
Does your mom hurt you, Jakob?

950
01:05:13,701 --> 01:05:19,174
Does your mom hurt you? Huh?

951
01:05:19,374 --> 01:05:25,928
You can tell me.

952
01:05:26,131 --> 01:05:29,260
OK.

953
01:05:29,467 --> 01:05:31,936
Thank you.

954
01:05:36,474 --> 01:05:38,317
OK.

955
01:05:38,518 --> 01:05:40,737
All right, let's get to bed.

956
01:05:40,937 --> 01:05:42,484
Come on.

957
01:05:48,736 --> 01:05:52,115
OK. Good night.

958
01:06:30,987 --> 01:06:32,989
I'm home now, Paige.
You can leave.

959
01:06:35,575 --> 01:06:39,125
Um...I just wanted to talk

960
01:06:39,329 --> 01:06:41,707
to you about something.

961
01:06:41,915 --> 01:06:42,916
Yeah? What's that?

962
01:06:43,124 --> 01:06:46,799
Um, it just seems like most
of the time that I take care of

963
01:06:47,003 --> 01:06:51,804
Jakob, I find some kind of...bruises
or marks on him somewhere.

964
01:06:52,008 --> 01:06:56,263
And tonight, on his arm, he had...

965
01:06:58,723 --> 01:07:00,976
Paige, honey, I've already
told you that people with his

966
01:07:01,184 --> 01:07:03,403
condition have these random fits of aggression.

967
01:07:03,603 --> 01:07:06,823
Those fits, most of the time,
result in him getting banged up,

968
01:07:07,023 --> 01:07:10,448
and there's really nothing you
or I or anyone can do about it,

969
01:07:10,652 --> 01:07:15,328
aside from chaining the boy to a wall.

970
01:07:15,532 --> 01:07:19,457
Every time I've ever watched
him, I've never once seen him

971
01:07:19,661 --> 01:07:23,291
hurt himself in any way.

972
01:07:23,498 --> 01:07:26,092
Just because you spend a few
hours a week with him doesn't

973
01:07:26,292 --> 01:07:28,841
mean you understand everything
about his condition.

974
01:07:29,045 --> 01:07:32,675
I have been living with this
shit for 15 years, and believe

975
01:07:32,882 --> 01:07:35,431
me...you have no idea what it
can be like.

976
01:07:35,635 --> 01:07:37,933
I understand that.
But I just...

977
01:07:38,137 --> 01:07:40,981
Paige, I don't like where you're going with this.

978
01:07:41,182 --> 01:07:47,110
Is there something you want to ask me?

979
01:07:47,313 --> 01:07:49,156
No.

980
01:07:49,357 --> 01:07:53,112
No, I...no.

981
01:07:53,319 --> 01:07:55,993
I just...I really care about

982
01:07:56,197 --> 01:07:59,622
him, and I hate to see him in

983
01:07:59,826 --> 01:08:01,123
any kind of pain.

984
01:08:02,870 --> 01:08:05,123
Well, that makes two of us.

985
01:08:11,462 --> 01:08:13,305
OK.

986
01:08:13,506 --> 01:08:15,258
Good night.

987
01:09:42,762 --> 01:09:46,562
Adult protective services.
How can I help you?

988
01:09:46,766 --> 01:09:48,939
Hi.

989
01:09:49,143 --> 01:09:51,987
Um, I..I'd like to report a
possible abuse.

990
01:09:53,773 --> 01:09:57,073
OK. What is your name?

991
01:09:57,276 --> 01:09:59,904
Do I have to say?

992
01:10:00,113 --> 01:10:05,415
No, not at this time, but we
may eventually need to know.

993
01:10:05,618 --> 01:10:07,996
OK.

994
01:10:08,204 --> 01:10:15,588
What can you tell me about the alleged victim?

995
01:10:15,795 --> 01:10:19,595
Um...he has a condition, so

996
01:10:19,799 --> 01:10:23,269
I'm not...I'm not totally sure

997
01:10:23,469 --> 01:10:24,937
that he's being abused.

998
01:10:25,138 --> 01:10:28,688
That's OK. I understand.
If you have a suspicion, then

999
01:10:28,891 --> 01:10:31,360
you are doing the right thing by calling.

1000
01:10:36,482 --> 01:10:40,282
Now, what makes you think this
person is being abused?

1001
01:10:40,486 --> 01:10:42,329
Well, I've seen marks on them

1002
01:10:42,530 --> 01:10:47,536
...bruises, um, scratches
around their wrist.

1003
01:10:47,744 --> 01:10:50,213
OK. Have you ever actually

1004
01:10:50,413 --> 01:10:54,759
seen this person being physically abused?

1005
01:10:54,959 --> 01:10:56,677
No, not really.

1006
01:10:59,297 --> 01:11:03,393
OK, is there anyone else that
might have seen this happening?

1007
01:11:03,593 --> 01:11:05,266
I don't...I don't know.

1008
01:11:05,470 --> 01:11:07,472
I don't...I really don't think
so.

1009
01:11:10,349 --> 01:11:18,154
Do you have any idea who may
be causing the abuse?

1010
01:11:18,357 --> 01:11:22,282
Um...

1011
01:11:22,487 --> 01:11:26,913
Ma'am, I'm sorry, but these
are questions I have to ask.

1012
01:11:27,116 --> 01:11:33,624
I know this is scary, but I have to get
some kind of information from you.

1013
01:11:33,831 --> 01:11:37,836
Now, can you at least tell me the name of the person

1014
01:11:38,044 --> 01:11:44,051
that you believe is being abused?

1015
01:11:44,258 --> 01:11:45,258
Ma'am?

1016
01:12:11,244 --> 01:12:12,244
Hello?

1017
01:12:12,370 --> 01:12:15,920
Oh, hi, Paige. It's Janice.

1018
01:12:16,123 --> 01:12:17,841
Hey.

1019
01:12:18,042 --> 01:12:19,464
Look, um, the other night...

1020
01:12:19,669 --> 01:12:22,343
I hope you didn't take anything
I said the wrong way.

1021
01:12:22,547 --> 01:12:25,175
I really do appreciate all the
help you've given us.

1022
01:12:25,383 --> 01:12:31,265
It's just when it comes to my
Jakob, I can be real protective.

1023
01:12:31,472 --> 01:12:33,600
No, no. I...I understand.

1024
01:12:33,808 --> 01:12:36,152
Good, good.

1025
01:12:36,352 --> 01:12:38,980
Now, the...the reason I'm
calling, and I know it's short

1026
01:12:39,188 --> 01:12:42,738
notice, but Charles wants to take
me out to lunch this afternoon.

1027
01:12:42,942 --> 01:12:49,291
Um, is there any way you could
be here in, say, uh, an hour?

1028
01:12:49,490 --> 01:12:52,869
Um...

1029
01:12:53,077 --> 01:12:55,125
Yeah, sure.
That's fine, no problem.

1030
01:12:55,329 --> 01:12:56,876
Oh, OK.

1031
01:12:57,081 --> 01:12:58,350
Well, I need to start getting ready, then.

1032
01:12:58,374 --> 01:12:59,375
OK, ms. Trim...

1033
01:13:32,241 --> 01:13:34,414
he's in his bedroom.

1034
01:14:31,217 --> 01:14:33,640
That looks really nice.

1035
01:14:38,724 --> 01:14:41,318
Can we put this away now?

1036
01:14:41,519 --> 01:14:43,521
Come on.

1037
01:15:02,248 --> 01:15:07,049
OK. Jakob...

1038
01:15:07,253 --> 01:15:10,974
Jakob...look at me.

1039
01:15:11,173 --> 01:15:14,473
I'm gonna...

1040
01:15:14,677 --> 01:15:16,805
It's gonna be OK, all right?

1041
01:15:17,013 --> 01:15:19,607
It's gonna be OK.

1042
01:15:19,807 --> 01:15:22,105
I'm just gonna...

1043
01:15:22,309 --> 01:15:25,939
Gonna be safe now, OK?

1044
01:15:26,147 --> 01:15:28,525
It'll be OK now.

1045
01:15:45,750 --> 01:15:48,173
It's gonna be OK, OK?

1046
01:15:48,377 --> 01:15:52,427
It's gonna be OK.

1047
01:16:01,390 --> 01:16:02,482
It's OK.

1048
01:16:02,683 --> 01:16:07,189
It's gonna be OK.

1049
01:16:07,396 --> 01:16:09,865
It's gonna be OK.

1050
01:16:10,066 --> 01:16:12,535
Shh, shh.

1051
01:16:12,735 --> 01:16:14,408
Look at me, Jakob.

1052
01:16:24,622 --> 01:16:32,622
It's gonna be OK.
You're OK. Shh.

1053
01:16:38,594 --> 01:16:40,596
That's good, that's good.

1054
01:16:40,805 --> 01:16:42,398
It's OK. You're OK.

1055
01:16:42,598 --> 01:16:44,646
You're doing really well.

1056
01:16:44,850 --> 01:16:46,852
You're doing really well.

1057
01:17:14,964 --> 01:17:19,964
OK.
That's good, that's good.

1058
01:19:29,890 --> 01:19:31,813
I'm so sorry about this.

1059
01:19:32,017 --> 01:19:34,736
Just stand up with me, OK?

1060
01:19:34,937 --> 01:19:38,783
Come here. Come here. Come here.

1061
01:19:38,983 --> 01:19:40,735
OK. You're really good.
I'm so sorry.

1062
01:19:40,943 --> 01:19:43,742
Just one more thing, OK?
Just one more thing, and you're

1063
01:19:43,946 --> 01:19:51,946
gonna be safe.
Come on.

1064
01:19:52,955 --> 01:19:55,629
It's OK. It's OK.
Just one more thing.

1065
01:19:55,833 --> 01:19:59,428
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.

1066
01:20:41,378 --> 01:20:43,380
What is it?

1067
01:20:43,589 --> 01:20:45,262
Don't fucking touch me!

1068
01:20:45,466 --> 01:20:46,809
Where's Jakob?!

1069
01:22:09,508 --> 01:22:11,977
Take your bra off, please.

1070
01:22:24,898 --> 01:22:30,621
Arms straight out.

1071
01:22:36,952 --> 01:22:38,750
Turn your face to the right.

1072
01:22:38,954 --> 01:22:42,128
Not your body, just your head.

1073
01:22:43,792 --> 01:22:45,353
OK, scoot all the way down to the end of the bed.

1074
01:22:45,377 --> 01:22:46,845
Just try to relax, OK?

1075
01:22:47,045 --> 01:22:50,049
You're gonna feel my hands.
Just try and relax. Good.

1076
01:22:50,257 --> 01:22:51,975
All right. Hard speculum, OK?

1077
01:22:52,176 --> 01:22:54,520
And you're gonna feel some pressure.

1078
01:22:54,720 --> 01:22:57,189
Just try to relax. OK.

1079
01:22:57,389 --> 01:23:00,814
OK, just relax.

1080
01:23:01,018 --> 01:23:03,737
And I'm gonna take some samples.

1081
01:23:03,937 --> 01:23:09,865
You'll feel some cramping.

1082
01:23:10,068 --> 01:23:15,541
There's some. Just relax.

1083
01:23:26,752 --> 01:23:31,849
There we go.

1084
01:23:32,049 --> 01:23:34,472
You can come in now.

1085
01:23:41,391 --> 01:23:44,986
You OK? Comfortable?

1086
01:23:45,187 --> 01:23:48,236
Do you need anything?

1087
01:23:48,440 --> 01:23:51,489
OK. It's been a long day.

1088
01:24:04,706 --> 01:24:09,462
We'll be right downstairs, honey.

1089
01:24:09,670 --> 01:24:11,923
Try to get some rest.

1090
01:24:33,610 --> 01:24:37,706
Paige.

1091
01:24:37,906 --> 01:24:38,906
How's it going?

1092
01:24:39,074 --> 01:24:40,747
Hey. Good. Good. I'm good.

1093
01:24:40,951 --> 01:24:42,828
We didn't know you were back.

1094
01:24:43,036 --> 01:24:44,834
Yeah, I just...I just got
back.

1095
01:24:45,038 --> 01:24:45,789
Are you OK?

1096
01:24:45,998 --> 01:24:46,998
Yeah, I'm fine.

1097
01:24:47,040 --> 01:24:47,836
Yeah?

1098
01:24:48,041 --> 01:24:52,717
When we heard about what
happened, I mean...I just...

1099
01:24:52,921 --> 01:24:54,423
We were just wondering if you

1100
01:24:54,631 --> 01:24:56,508
would do another girls' night out?

1101
01:24:56,717 --> 01:24:58,890
It'd be a good distraction from everything.

1102
01:24:59,094 --> 01:25:01,517
Yeah. No, that would be...
It'd be fine.

1103
01:25:01,722 --> 01:25:02,063
OK.

1104
01:25:02,264 --> 01:25:02,935
All right.

1105
01:25:03,140 --> 01:25:04,140
We'll call you.

1106
01:25:04,266 --> 01:25:05,768
Uh, yeah, I'll call you.

1107
01:25:05,976 --> 01:25:06,272
Bye.

1108
01:25:06,476 --> 01:25:11,476
OK, well, see you later,
then...I guess.

1109
01:27:54,227 --> 01:27:55,227
Richmond police de...

1110
01:28:30,472 --> 01:28:32,224
I know you're in there.

1111
01:28:32,432 --> 01:28:35,231
Come on, Paige, open the door.

1112
01:28:35,435 --> 01:28:38,314
Open up, Paige! Open up!

1113
01:28:48,114 --> 01:28:52,210
Hey, look what I did.

1114
01:28:52,410 --> 01:28:54,253
Open the door!

1115
01:28:54,454 --> 01:28:55,626
Open it up!

1116
01:28:57,582 --> 01:28:59,050
Come on, Paige!

1117
01:28:59,251 --> 01:29:00,924
I'm coming in there!

1118
01:29:01,127 --> 01:29:02,879
I'm coming in for you!

1119
01:29:04,214 --> 01:29:07,514
Janice, Janice, please, I'm so sorry.

1120
01:29:07,717 --> 01:29:10,220
Please. I'm so sorry.

1121
01:29:10,428 --> 01:29:12,226
I don't care.
Janice, please.

1122
01:29:12,430 --> 01:29:13,852
I don't care.
I'm so sorry.

1123
01:29:14,057 --> 01:29:15,149
Aaaah!

1124
01:29:20,647 --> 01:29:22,149
Oh, my god!

1125
01:29:22,357 --> 01:29:25,201
This is what you deserve.

1126
01:29:34,494 --> 01:29:36,371
What?!

1127
01:29:43,920 --> 01:29:45,547
No, you stay back. Stay back!

1128
01:29:45,755 --> 01:29:46,802
Get away from me!

1129
01:29:47,007 --> 01:29:48,179
Aah!

1130
01:30:44,773 --> 01:30:47,572
Hello? Hello? Yes.

1131
01:30:47,776 --> 01:30:50,074
Yes, I...need...I need someone.

1132
01:30:50,278 --> 01:30:52,997
I need help.
There's somebody in my house,

1133
01:30:53,198 --> 01:30:55,542
and she...
No, she's still here.

1134
01:30:55,742 --> 01:30:57,244
No, I don't think so.

1135
01:30:57,452 --> 01:31:00,797
I don't think so.
Can you please help me? Please?

1136
01:31:02,457 --> 01:31:05,461
Um...OK.

1137
01:31:05,669 --> 01:31:09,719
I'm at 1134 Fairway Drive.

1138
01:31:09,923 --> 01:31:11,641
OK. Thank you so much.

1139
01:31:11,841 --> 01:31:14,264
Please hurry.
