2
00:00:29,641 --> 00:00:31,277
Are we alone out here?

3
00:00:31,342 --> 00:00:34,180
Yes, sir.

4
00:00:34,246 --> 00:00:36,514
No Americans in the area, sir.

5
00:00:40,018 --> 00:00:41,452
Run the program.

6
00:00:48,693 --> 00:00:51,529
I said run
the program, Dr. Lee.

7
00:00:52,430 --> 00:00:53,698
Yes, Captain.

8
00:01:10,014 --> 00:01:11,783
[rumbling]

9
00:01:33,071 --> 00:01:35,640
All of America's
personal communications

10
00:01:35,707 --> 00:01:38,743
brought down through
a satellite in mere seconds.

11
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:44,250
There are no secrets anymore
thanks to our work, Dr. Lee.

12
00:01:44,316 --> 00:01:46,851
Don't worry, Dr. Lee.

13
00:01:46,918 --> 00:01:48,786
The American's won't
find us here.

14
00:01:51,823 --> 00:01:53,391
[roars]

15
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,567
[crash]

16
00:02:03,701 --> 00:02:06,104
Captain! Something hit us!

17
00:02:07,772 --> 00:02:09,674
A ship? The Americans?

18
00:02:09,741 --> 00:02:11,676
I... don't think so...

19
00:02:11,743 --> 00:02:13,379
I think it's... alive.

20
00:02:13,444 --> 00:02:14,380
[alarm blaring]

21
00:02:14,445 --> 00:02:15,880
[crashing]

22
00:02:23,154 --> 00:02:24,589
I'm sending a
distress signal, Captain.

23
00:02:24,656 --> 00:02:26,057
No... no...

24
00:02:26,124 --> 00:02:30,195
The technology on this
ship could... start a war.

25
00:02:30,262 --> 00:02:31,562
[creaking]

26
00:02:33,598 --> 00:02:35,566
[screaming]

27
00:03:09,033 --> 00:03:10,668
[grunting]

28
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:15,307
[panting]

29
00:03:15,374 --> 00:03:17,075
[screams]

30
00:04:46,164 --> 00:04:49,901
No two ways about it.
You got a raw deal, Commander.

31
00:04:49,967 --> 00:04:51,270
<i>I screwed the pooch, Captain.</i>

32
00:04:51,336 --> 00:04:53,272
You stood behind your people.

33
00:04:53,338 --> 00:04:56,275
And my sister and
I are forever grateful.

34
00:04:56,341 --> 00:04:58,709
Commander Lynch did
what she had to do

35
00:04:58,776 --> 00:05:01,346
to save as many lives as
possible from that thing.

36
00:05:01,413 --> 00:05:04,216
<i>Your sister deep-sixed
a destroyer to save lives</i>

37
00:05:04,283 --> 00:05:05,850
<i>from "a thing that
doesn't exist."</i>

38
00:05:05,917 --> 00:05:07,785
Oh, it exists, Brian,

39
00:05:07,852 --> 00:05:11,323
just like the Chinese
ship circling our waters.

40
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:13,958
So you'll be going out there
to see it, yes?

41
00:05:14,025 --> 00:05:17,196
<i>No. The Admiral is handling
it all from D.C.</i>

42
00:05:17,262 --> 00:05:19,231
According to him,
it's legal transit

43
00:05:19,298 --> 00:05:21,666
of the U.S. territorial seas
conducted in accordance

44
00:05:21,732 --> 00:05:23,668
with the Law of
the Sea Convention

45
00:05:23,734 --> 00:05:25,603
and we're supposed
to stay out of it.

46
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:30,641
So they trust
a foreign government,

47
00:05:30,708 --> 00:05:34,846
an enemy, but not
your sister, right?

48
00:05:34,912 --> 00:05:36,381
Hmm, looks that way.

49
00:05:36,448 --> 00:05:39,284
Doesn't look that way.
That's the way it is.

50
00:05:39,351 --> 00:05:41,119
They said it's a "product of
fabrication,

51
00:05:41,186 --> 00:05:44,088
exhaustion and confusion
and nothing else."

52
00:05:44,155 --> 00:05:46,791
You know, your sister's
a lot of things,

53
00:05:46,858 --> 00:05:49,060
but she's no liar.

54
00:05:49,127 --> 00:05:52,431
<i>If she said a
million-pound megalodon</i>

55
00:05:52,498 --> 00:05:55,467
<i>ate her ship, well...</i>

56
00:05:55,534 --> 00:05:58,237
Hey, I'm gonna believe it.

57
00:05:58,303 --> 00:06:01,172
Because just like you,

58
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:03,875
your sister is
a very good person.

59
00:06:03,941 --> 00:06:06,211
So are you.
You stood behind her.

60
00:06:06,278 --> 00:06:08,079
I don't know what else
you were supposed to do.

61
00:06:08,146 --> 00:06:12,083
Let's hope the Admiral feels
the same way during my hearing.

62
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:13,751
<i>Your sister shouldn't
have been court-martialed.</i>

63
00:06:13,818 --> 00:06:15,354
<i>She shouldn't have.</i>

64
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:18,223
And I'll be goddamned if
she'll be court-martialed alone.

65
00:06:18,290 --> 00:06:19,491
You'll get your rank back,
Commander.

66
00:06:19,558 --> 00:06:21,025
I'm sure of it.

67
00:06:21,092 --> 00:06:23,761
<i>Will they give me back
my submarine project, too?</i>

68
00:06:23,828 --> 00:06:27,965
I hate to see that
beautiful piece of machinery

69
00:06:28,032 --> 00:06:31,669
<i>mothballed at the final
testing stage.</i>

70
00:06:31,736 --> 00:06:36,140
You know, a deep-sea machine
like that

71
00:06:36,208 --> 00:06:39,710
might even confirm
the existence of that megalodon

72
00:06:39,777 --> 00:06:41,679
if they just let me finish,

73
00:06:41,746 --> 00:06:43,515
if they just let me
back on the project

74
00:06:43,582 --> 00:06:46,717
which I don't think they will.

75
00:06:46,784 --> 00:06:48,119
Captain Lynch!

76
00:06:48,187 --> 00:06:49,787
We're getting
an abnormal distress call.

77
00:06:49,854 --> 00:06:52,089
Tuan located it and we're
nearly on top of the ship now.

78
00:06:52,156 --> 00:06:54,459
We still haven't deciphered
the code on whose ship that is.

79
00:06:54,526 --> 00:06:56,794
Seems to have been
intentionally masked, Captain.

80
00:06:56,861 --> 00:06:59,298
Hmm.
Let's peel back that mask.

81
00:06:59,364 --> 00:07:00,499
See if it has anything
to do with

82
00:07:00,566 --> 00:07:01,899
those ships circling our waters.

83
00:07:01,966 --> 00:07:05,770
- Let's get underway.
- Yes, ma'am.

84
00:07:05,836 --> 00:07:06,938
Thank you, Commander.

85
00:07:07,004 --> 00:07:10,074
Happy to do it.
Stay safe.

86
00:07:17,081 --> 00:07:21,453
Ah, see, I'm not saying
she's not good at her job,

87
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,754
not at all.

88
00:07:23,821 --> 00:07:25,324
I'm just saying...

89
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:30,495
Just saying... when are you not
just saying something, XO?

90
00:07:30,562 --> 00:07:32,763
Yes, Tuan.

91
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:37,134
I'm just saying
she is not aggressive.

92
00:07:38,403 --> 00:07:41,406
Is that a bad thing
or a good thing?

93
00:07:41,473 --> 00:07:44,809
Is that a bad thing?

94
00:07:44,875 --> 00:07:48,145
We are in the Navy, hmm?

95
00:07:48,213 --> 00:07:51,148
Not some damn summer camp.

96
00:07:51,216 --> 00:07:54,286
You know I'm right,
you know I'm right.

97
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:59,957
That's why I'm already
Lieutenant Commander, hmm?

98
00:08:00,024 --> 00:08:03,160
I got that fight.
I'm old school.

99
00:08:03,228 --> 00:08:06,331
I'm about kickin' ass
and takin' names,

100
00:08:06,398 --> 00:08:09,967
not playing grab-ass
kumbaya with our enemies.

101
00:08:10,034 --> 00:08:11,802
How about your friends, sir?

102
00:08:11,869 --> 00:08:13,338
He doesn't have any.

103
00:08:13,405 --> 00:08:15,240
[laughing]

104
00:08:16,974 --> 00:08:18,843
Y'all funny.

105
00:08:21,078 --> 00:08:22,414
Captain on the deck!

106
00:08:24,849 --> 00:08:26,851
What's so funny in here, people?

107
00:08:29,521 --> 00:08:31,590
Nothing, Captain.

108
00:08:31,657 --> 00:08:33,991
We're still getting the
distress signals, Captain.

109
00:08:34,058 --> 00:08:35,427
So I heard, Tuan.

110
00:08:35,494 --> 00:08:38,563
Ahearn suggested
we reorient to the location.

111
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:41,866
I assumed that's
what you wanted to do.

112
00:08:41,932 --> 00:08:43,901
You assumed right, Ahearn.

113
00:08:43,968 --> 00:08:45,470
Thank you, Captain.

114
00:08:45,537 --> 00:08:47,905
But you should stop assuming
while you're ahead.

115
00:08:47,972 --> 00:08:50,275
Understand me?

116
00:08:50,342 --> 00:08:52,043
Aye, ma'am.

117
00:08:52,109 --> 00:08:53,944
How close are we, Tuan?

118
00:08:54,011 --> 00:08:55,614
Nearly on top of it, ma'am.

119
00:08:55,681 --> 00:08:57,215
We see anything?

120
00:08:57,282 --> 00:09:01,286
Negative, ma'am,
but still receiving the signal.

121
00:09:01,353 --> 00:09:04,690
Whatever it is, she's sunk.

122
00:09:04,756 --> 00:09:05,956
Any signs of life, Tuan?

123
00:09:06,023 --> 00:09:07,559
No S.O.L., ma'am.

124
00:09:07,626 --> 00:09:10,729
I'm not seeing
any more signs, ma'am.

125
00:09:10,796 --> 00:09:12,129
Uh, ma'am?

126
00:09:12,197 --> 00:09:14,232
We have a confirmation
of an unknown object

127
00:09:14,299 --> 00:09:17,001
in the water from
the deck crew.

128
00:09:17,068 --> 00:09:18,135
Any idea what, Wilco?

129
00:09:18,203 --> 00:09:21,239
Any idea what it is?

130
00:09:21,306 --> 00:09:23,241
Debris?

131
00:09:26,311 --> 00:09:27,279
Really?

132
00:09:27,346 --> 00:09:30,716
What is the unknown
object, Wilco?

133
00:09:30,782 --> 00:09:32,250
It's a survivor.

134
00:10:19,631 --> 00:10:23,067
She's seen some pretty
intense exposure.

135
00:10:23,134 --> 00:10:25,903
At least two or three
days worth,

136
00:10:25,970 --> 00:10:30,007
additionally lacerations,
some bruising,

137
00:10:30,074 --> 00:10:32,244
very likely a concussion.

138
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:34,446
She's a Chinese national.

139
00:10:34,513 --> 00:10:37,948
Pretty close to
U.S. waters, Captain.

140
00:10:38,015 --> 00:10:40,951
Nothing about them in
our files or schedules.

141
00:10:41,018 --> 00:10:43,422
Keep an eye on her, Dr. Ray.

142
00:10:43,488 --> 00:10:45,690
I have a few questions
for her when she wakes up.

143
00:10:45,757 --> 00:10:47,192
Aye, ma'am.

144
00:10:57,502 --> 00:10:58,437
Ma'am?

145
00:11:00,070 --> 00:11:03,140
Do you think
she's Chinese Intelligence

146
00:11:03,208 --> 00:11:08,547
and her ship was on some
kind of off-label mission?

147
00:11:10,348 --> 00:11:12,818
I think this
is above my pay grade.

148
00:11:12,884 --> 00:11:14,319
Hmm.

149
00:11:14,386 --> 00:11:15,654
It's time we loop
the Admiral in.

150
00:11:17,189 --> 00:11:18,757
And you know what
I'll do then, Ahearn?

151
00:11:18,824 --> 00:11:20,492
What, ma'am?

152
00:11:20,559 --> 00:11:24,563
Whatever they tell me,
grab-ass kumbaya or otherwise.

153
00:11:27,265 --> 00:11:28,500
Yes, ma'am.

154
00:11:28,567 --> 00:11:29,868
Captain!

155
00:11:29,935 --> 00:11:31,436
Yes, Brand?

156
00:11:31,503 --> 00:11:33,371
You just oughta see this, ma'am.

157
00:11:33,438 --> 00:11:35,240
See what?

158
00:11:47,151 --> 00:11:48,453
Is that a Chinese ship, ma'am?

159
00:11:50,154 --> 00:11:51,088
Affirmative, Brand.

160
00:11:51,155 --> 00:11:52,491
What are they doing here?

161
00:11:52,557 --> 00:11:54,024
They're not supposed to be
in these waters.

162
00:11:54,091 --> 00:11:55,594
That's why
we need answers, Brand.

163
00:11:59,631 --> 00:12:01,666
Captain on the bridge!

164
00:12:01,733 --> 00:12:03,033
Affirmative.

165
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:04,402
I will send that message.

166
00:12:04,469 --> 00:12:06,238
Was that Commander Moore?
Admiral Green?

167
00:12:06,304 --> 00:12:07,472
No, ma'am.

168
00:12:07,539 --> 00:12:09,708
That was the captain
of the Tsai.

169
00:12:09,774 --> 00:12:11,576
He's spoken with our
superiors in San Diego,

170
00:12:11,643 --> 00:12:14,044
and says he has full legal
permission to travel our waters.

171
00:12:14,111 --> 00:12:15,547
He is claiming innocent passage.

172
00:12:15,614 --> 00:12:17,616
They're requesting that
we and all the U.S. ships

173
00:12:17,682 --> 00:12:19,718
evacuate the area
so they can search for a ship

174
00:12:19,784 --> 00:12:21,920
that went off-course
during bad weather.

175
00:12:21,987 --> 00:12:23,221
Bad weather?

176
00:12:23,288 --> 00:12:24,890
Bad weather, ma'am.

177
00:12:24,956 --> 00:12:27,392
Their ship is assumed lost and
they are looking for survivors.

178
00:12:27,459 --> 00:12:29,494
Was there additional
wreckage, radar, sonar?

179
00:12:29,561 --> 00:12:32,797
I am picking up
something below us, Captain.

180
00:12:32,864 --> 00:12:33,798
Below us?

181
00:12:33,865 --> 00:12:35,267
Yes, ma'am.

182
00:12:35,333 --> 00:12:38,637
From what I can surmise,
there is a tall shelf below us,

183
00:12:38,703 --> 00:12:40,572
nearly 20 fathoms.

184
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:42,807
It appears there's
something there,

185
00:12:42,874 --> 00:12:44,409
most likely the survivor's ship.

186
00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:48,680
I find this all highly suspect.

187
00:12:48,747 --> 00:12:51,550
- Do you agree, Ahearn?
- Yes, ma'am.

188
00:12:51,616 --> 00:12:53,218
It's not every day
a Chinese destroyer

189
00:12:53,285 --> 00:12:55,353
rolls into our town
without prior authorization.

190
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:57,923
Agreed, ma'am.
Very fishy.

191
00:12:57,989 --> 00:13:01,326
- Wilco?
- Yes, ma'am?

192
00:13:01,393 --> 00:13:02,827
Tell them we found a survivor.

193
00:13:03,962 --> 00:13:06,298
Something wrong, Ahearn?

194
00:13:06,364 --> 00:13:07,599
No, ma'am.

195
00:13:07,666 --> 00:13:09,734
Tell them
she's still unconscious

196
00:13:09,801 --> 00:13:11,803
and their ship seems
to have sunk.

197
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:14,739
Don't tell them precisely
where if they're not asking.

198
00:13:14,806 --> 00:13:16,508
Yes, ma'am.

199
00:13:16,575 --> 00:13:18,043
Fewer moving parts,
the better, people.

200
00:13:18,108 --> 00:13:19,311
Let's keep that all in mind.

201
00:13:19,377 --> 00:13:21,279
- Yes, ma'am.
- Yes, ma'am.

202
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:32,791
Actually, hold that, Wilco.

203
00:13:32,857 --> 00:13:35,794
Tuan, you speak Mandarin,
don't you?

204
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:38,162
Yes, ma'am...
well, around the house.

205
00:13:38,229 --> 00:13:39,531
I'm a little bit rusty.

206
00:13:39,598 --> 00:13:41,165
Rusty like you mix up ducks
and geese

207
00:13:41,232 --> 00:13:44,436
or rusty like the bed that fell
out of my father's truck?

208
00:13:44,502 --> 00:13:46,136
First one, I think, ma'am.

209
00:13:46,204 --> 00:13:48,406
Look at
Lieutenant Commander Ahearn.

210
00:13:48,473 --> 00:13:52,510
Tell me what he's thinking...
in Mandarin.

211
00:13:52,577 --> 00:13:56,281
I wish I didn't have
such small hands.

212
00:13:58,115 --> 00:13:59,517
That'll work fine.

213
00:13:59,584 --> 00:14:02,420
Wilco, put her on the comms
with the Chinese.

214
00:14:02,487 --> 00:14:04,289
Aye, ma'am.
Already on it.

215
00:14:04,356 --> 00:14:07,826
Attention, CNS Tsai,
this is the USS King.

216
00:14:07,892 --> 00:14:09,995
Do you read me?

217
00:14:10,061 --> 00:14:11,262
Don't look so worried, Ahearn.

218
00:14:11,329 --> 00:14:12,864
I'm sure she
said something nice.

219
00:14:12,931 --> 00:14:16,001
Your survivor is unconscious
and you ship seems to have sunk.

220
00:14:16,067 --> 00:14:17,202
Ma'am?

221
00:14:17,268 --> 00:14:18,837
Yes, Tuan?

222
00:14:18,903 --> 00:14:20,572
They're saying by
international agreement,

223
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:23,808
we must hand over
the survivor and depart.

224
00:14:23,875 --> 00:14:26,044
Hand over and depart?

225
00:14:26,111 --> 00:14:29,581
Well, that's not just arrogant.
It's wrong.

226
00:14:29,648 --> 00:14:32,050
I can put them on
your comms if you want.

227
00:14:32,117 --> 00:14:34,719
No. Let's keep it impersonal.

228
00:14:34,786 --> 00:14:37,255
Tell them I need
to pass it up the flagpole.

229
00:14:37,322 --> 00:14:40,258
We have received your request

230
00:14:40,325 --> 00:14:43,194
and must pass it on to
our commanding officers.

231
00:14:43,261 --> 00:14:45,463
All right.

232
00:14:45,530 --> 00:14:47,298
Yes, I will tell her.

233
00:14:47,365 --> 00:14:48,833
What did they say, Tuan?

234
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:51,369
They said that
it's an act of war.

235
00:14:51,436 --> 00:14:54,339
An act of... an act of war?

236
00:14:54,406 --> 00:14:56,608
Not handing back a survivor

237
00:14:56,675 --> 00:14:59,310
is said it will be
seen as an act of war

238
00:14:59,377 --> 00:15:00,912
between the two countries.

239
00:15:00,979 --> 00:15:02,981
What should I tell them?

240
00:15:03,048 --> 00:15:04,983
End all communications!

241
00:15:05,050 --> 00:15:06,418
Put the big guns on the horn!

242
00:15:06,484 --> 00:15:08,053
Aye, ma'am.

243
00:15:08,119 --> 00:15:09,788
Ahearn?

244
00:15:09,854 --> 00:15:11,956
Do you have the
copy of the UNCLOS?

245
00:15:12,023 --> 00:15:14,259
Yes, in my berth, ma'am.

246
00:15:14,325 --> 00:15:16,494
I want to check
the Innocent Passage.

247
00:15:16,561 --> 00:15:20,365
Brand, go and fetch
Ahearn's book from his berth.

248
00:15:20,432 --> 00:15:22,067
Right away, ma'am!

249
00:15:22,133 --> 00:15:25,437
Ma'am, permission to exit the
bridge to find the book myself.

250
00:15:25,503 --> 00:15:29,040
I'm not a hundred
that I know where it is.

251
00:15:29,107 --> 00:15:30,442
Permission granted.

252
00:15:30,508 --> 00:15:31,910
Thank you, Captain.

253
00:16:10,582 --> 00:16:12,484
What do you think?

254
00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:13,952
She'll live.

255
00:16:15,286 --> 00:16:17,622
Can you wake her up?

256
00:16:17,689 --> 00:16:19,557
I don't think I should, sir.

257
00:16:22,594 --> 00:16:24,295
Is something the matter?

258
00:16:24,362 --> 00:16:26,831
World War III.

259
00:16:26,898 --> 00:16:27,832
What?

260
00:16:29,467 --> 00:16:30,902
Never mind.

261
00:16:30,969 --> 00:16:34,506
Just let me know
the minute she wakes up.

262
00:16:34,572 --> 00:16:37,243
I'll let the Captain
know the minute it happens.

263
00:16:37,308 --> 00:16:39,611
Let me know.

264
00:16:39,677 --> 00:16:41,446
I'll keep the Captain apprised.

265
00:16:44,949 --> 00:16:47,786
She is dealing directly
with the Chinese Navy.

266
00:16:47,852 --> 00:16:49,921
She has not the time
nor the inclination

267
00:16:49,988 --> 00:16:52,524
to be checking in
on Sleeping Beauty.

268
00:16:53,825 --> 00:16:55,059
Let me know.

269
00:16:55,126 --> 00:16:56,528
Yes, sir.

270
00:17:12,377 --> 00:17:15,181
Yes, sir.
I understand, sir.

271
00:17:15,247 --> 00:17:16,614
Thank you, Admiral Green.

272
00:17:21,686 --> 00:17:24,190
Should we ready the survivor
for transport, ma'am?

273
00:17:24,256 --> 00:17:26,057
No. We're staying here.

274
00:17:27,892 --> 00:17:30,595
Admiral Green wants
to keep her here?

275
00:17:30,662 --> 00:17:32,264
He wants us to do nothing,

276
00:17:32,330 --> 00:17:35,767
not engage with the Chinese
in any way to hurt or to help.

277
00:17:35,834 --> 00:17:37,468
We don't make a move
until they sort things out

278
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:39,904
with the Chinese directly,
which will take the day.

279
00:17:39,971 --> 00:17:41,039
Yes, ma'am.

280
00:17:41,105 --> 00:17:42,507
We're holding
our position, people.

281
00:17:42,574 --> 00:17:44,008
Stay on your toes.

282
00:17:44,075 --> 00:17:46,144
Ma'am?

283
00:17:46,212 --> 00:17:47,579
Yes, Wilco?

284
00:17:47,645 --> 00:17:50,249
The watch crew says that
they're aiming at us...

285
00:17:50,316 --> 00:17:51,783
They're what, Wilco?

286
00:17:55,753 --> 00:17:58,389
And readying their
munitions, ma'am.

287
00:18:04,896 --> 00:18:09,167
Indeed they are.
All right! Battle stations!

288
00:18:09,235 --> 00:18:11,469
We cannot let them get past us
and get to the San Diego shore!

289
00:18:11,536 --> 00:18:12,470
Yes, ma'am.

290
00:18:12,537 --> 00:18:13,671
[alarm blares]

291
00:18:16,541 --> 00:18:18,042
[bell rings]

292
00:18:30,088 --> 00:18:31,823
Are they reacting, Tan?

293
00:18:31,890 --> 00:18:35,593
They're moving into battle
readiness, I believe, Captain.

294
00:18:37,263 --> 00:18:38,529
Good.

295
00:18:39,497 --> 00:18:41,666
They are distracted.

296
00:18:42,867 --> 00:18:46,170
If they fire,
we send back two, people!

297
00:18:46,238 --> 00:18:48,340
Let 'em know they messed
with the wrong ship!

298
00:18:48,406 --> 00:18:49,774
- Yes, ma'am!
- Yes, ma'am!

299
00:18:49,841 --> 00:18:52,443
We await your order
to fire, Captain.

300
00:18:54,213 --> 00:18:55,914
I await my orders, as well, Tan.

301
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:58,183
And the imminent arrival
of the armada.

302
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:05,590
Yes, Captain.

303
00:19:17,001 --> 00:19:18,536
[crash]

304
00:19:20,972 --> 00:19:22,106
What was that?

305
00:19:22,173 --> 00:19:23,409
Was that us?

306
00:19:23,474 --> 00:19:24,742
Was that us!?

307
00:19:24,809 --> 00:19:26,412
Who fired without my command?

308
00:19:26,477 --> 00:19:28,046
It wasn't us, ma'am.

309
00:19:31,417 --> 00:19:32,717
I know what's happening.

310
00:19:35,421 --> 00:19:37,455
What, ma'am?

311
00:19:37,522 --> 00:19:38,823
Megalodons!

312
00:19:47,598 --> 00:19:49,234
Keep your sights
on those things!

313
00:19:49,301 --> 00:19:50,568
Yes, ma'am.

314
00:19:56,541 --> 00:19:58,344
It's the meg...
I'm positive.

315
00:19:58,410 --> 00:19:59,811
And, uh...

316
00:20:01,012 --> 00:20:03,081
What? What?

317
00:20:06,484 --> 00:20:08,052
There's more than one!

318
00:20:08,119 --> 00:20:09,687
What?

319
00:20:09,754 --> 00:20:11,823
I see three fins,
Brian, three fins!

320
00:20:11,889 --> 00:20:14,826
Get outta there, Emily!
Get out of there now!

321
00:20:14,892 --> 00:20:16,694
Your sister barely survived one.

322
00:20:16,761 --> 00:20:18,563
You won't be able
to stop three.

323
00:20:18,629 --> 00:20:20,932
<i>Are they coming for you yet?</i>

324
00:20:20,999 --> 00:20:21,966
No.

325
00:20:22,033 --> 00:20:23,235
The Chinese ship
is firing on 'em.

326
00:20:23,302 --> 00:20:24,869
I think it's got them agitated.

327
00:20:24,936 --> 00:20:26,571
<i>It's like shooting
a tank with a pistol!</i>

328
00:20:26,637 --> 00:20:28,240
Just get out of there!

329
00:20:28,307 --> 00:20:30,575
If they come anywhere near us,
you blow those things to hell!

330
00:20:30,641 --> 00:20:32,277
Ma'am, yes, ma'am!

331
00:20:32,344 --> 00:20:34,846
Emily? You must leave!

332
00:20:34,912 --> 00:20:38,716
I can't.
I can't just leave.

333
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:40,185
Look, you cannot make a move.

334
00:20:40,252 --> 00:20:41,753
You cannot make a
move towards that ship, Emily,

335
00:20:41,819 --> 00:20:44,555
- or Admiral Green...
- I know!

336
00:20:44,622 --> 00:20:46,225
And you can't say
word one about the megs.

337
00:20:46,291 --> 00:20:47,759
I know!

338
00:20:47,825 --> 00:20:50,895
Well, you know what
he'll do if the Admiral

339
00:20:50,962 --> 00:20:53,798
hears any more talk about
megalodons or even sharks...

340
00:20:53,865 --> 00:20:56,667
I know! It's just sitting
here like this...

341
00:21:01,139 --> 00:21:02,106
Full ahead!

342
00:21:02,173 --> 00:21:03,141
Yes, sir.

343
00:21:03,208 --> 00:21:05,277
Full ahead! Full ahead!

344
00:21:06,778 --> 00:21:08,514
Look, they're
not our responsibility

345
00:21:08,579 --> 00:21:10,615
and I'm living proof
of his thoughts on megalodons

346
00:21:10,681 --> 00:21:14,118
<i>and stepping out when it's your
authority not to step out.</i>

347
00:21:14,186 --> 00:21:16,054
And you definitely cannot fire
at them

348
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:17,289
while
they're surrounding the ship.

349
00:21:17,356 --> 00:21:18,457
If you miss...

350
00:21:18,524 --> 00:21:21,659
I get it!
World War III.

351
00:21:21,726 --> 00:21:22,960
<i>Look, I wish I wasn't
trapped here</i>

352
00:21:23,027 --> 00:21:25,029
with my sub tarped
like a naked statue.

353
00:21:25,096 --> 00:21:28,599
And I could come and help you,
but your objective is clear.

354
00:21:28,666 --> 00:21:30,134
Please listen.

355
00:21:30,202 --> 00:21:33,638
Get the footage you need to
prove your sister's case

356
00:21:33,704 --> 00:21:36,574
that these things are real,

357
00:21:36,641 --> 00:21:38,477
<i>that that beast
destroyed her ship</i>

358
00:21:38,544 --> 00:21:43,182
and a Russian sub and put us
on the brink of conflict

359
00:21:43,248 --> 00:21:44,516
with the Russian Army,

360
00:21:44,582 --> 00:21:46,318
<i>and then get out of there.</i>

361
00:21:46,385 --> 00:21:48,586
We can't just leave
'em to die, Brian!

362
00:21:48,653 --> 00:21:52,324
Look, I'll contact Admiral Green
and tell him what's happening.

363
00:21:52,391 --> 00:21:54,460
He won't believe me,

364
00:21:54,526 --> 00:21:56,961
but I'm already in it and how
much worse could it get, right?

365
00:21:57,028 --> 00:22:00,698
Oh, it can get a lot worse.

366
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:10,808
Ma'am, we're ready
to fire on those things

367
00:22:10,875 --> 00:22:12,610
when you give us the command.

368
00:22:14,379 --> 00:22:16,848
With all due respect, Captain,

369
00:22:16,914 --> 00:22:19,318
I think we should be
departing immediately.

370
00:22:19,384 --> 00:22:22,221
Those sharks could turn
on us at any moment.

371
00:22:22,287 --> 00:22:23,621
And the Chinese
are way too distracted

372
00:22:23,688 --> 00:22:25,224
to start anything with us now.

373
00:22:25,290 --> 00:22:26,691
Now's our chance.

374
00:22:26,757 --> 00:22:28,393
We're staying here.

375
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:31,762
- But Captain...
- We're staying right here!

376
00:22:31,829 --> 00:22:35,534
Captain, if those things
turn on us...

377
00:22:35,601 --> 00:22:36,868
If those things come at us,

378
00:22:36,934 --> 00:22:39,837
do you think that
we can outpace them?

379
00:22:39,904 --> 00:22:42,508
You see how fast they are?

380
00:22:42,574 --> 00:22:43,941
We're staying here.

381
00:22:44,008 --> 00:22:47,246
Killian, tell Engineering
to kill the engines.

382
00:22:47,312 --> 00:22:49,780
Nothing noisy that will attract
those things before we have to.

383
00:22:49,847 --> 00:22:51,983
Aye, ma'am.

384
00:22:52,049 --> 00:22:54,586
Samperio, the moment
those things move away

385
00:22:54,652 --> 00:22:56,221
from the Chinese,
we fire on 'em!

386
00:22:56,288 --> 00:22:57,788
Yes, Ma'am!

387
00:22:57,855 --> 00:22:59,757
I can't imagine they still think
we're responsible for this mess.

388
00:22:59,824 --> 00:23:01,593
Ma'am?

389
00:23:01,659 --> 00:23:02,927
Yes, Tuan.

390
00:23:02,994 --> 00:23:05,062
They stopped attacking
the Chinese ship.

391
00:23:14,939 --> 00:23:16,642
Looks like they
sustained some damage,

392
00:23:16,707 --> 00:23:18,443
but they aren't totally sunk.

393
00:23:18,510 --> 00:23:19,977
I'm not sure, ma'am.

394
00:23:20,044 --> 00:23:23,714
The sharks dropped fast
like something hurt them or...

395
00:23:23,781 --> 00:23:25,816
Or they're regrouping and
looking for a better target.

396
00:23:27,685 --> 00:23:29,254
Confirming the sharks
are in sight

397
00:23:29,321 --> 00:23:31,022
and out of the danger zone
for the Chinese, ma'am.

398
00:23:31,088 --> 00:23:33,192
Samperio, let 'em
get a little closer

399
00:23:33,258 --> 00:23:35,561
and hit 'em all at once
nice and fast.

400
00:23:35,627 --> 00:23:36,894
<i>Turn that tide!</i>

401
00:23:36,961 --> 00:23:38,095
Yes, ma'am!

402
00:23:38,162 --> 00:23:40,164
Hold your fire until my mark.

403
00:23:41,633 --> 00:23:43,034
<i>They're just a
few hundred feet out, Captain!</i>

404
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:44,068
Wilco?

405
00:23:44,135 --> 00:23:45,736
Put Tuan on the comms
to the Chinese!

406
00:23:45,803 --> 00:23:47,439
Yes, ma'am.

407
00:23:47,506 --> 00:23:49,874
Tuan, inform the Chinese
that we will be firing,

408
00:23:49,941 --> 00:23:51,276
but not on them.

409
00:23:51,343 --> 00:23:52,477
Yes, ma'am.

410
00:23:52,544 --> 00:23:53,744
<i>Here they come!</i>

411
00:23:55,214 --> 00:23:56,415
Hold.

412
00:23:58,383 --> 00:23:59,917
Hold!

413
00:23:59,984 --> 00:24:02,254
- <i>Now!</i>
- <i>Open fire!</i>

414
00:24:02,321 --> 00:24:04,021
Fire! Fire! Fire!

415
00:24:12,163 --> 00:24:14,865
They're gone again, Captain.

416
00:24:14,932 --> 00:24:16,301
Hold fire, Samperio!

417
00:24:16,368 --> 00:24:19,371
Hold fire! Hold fire!
Hold your fire!

418
00:24:21,005 --> 00:24:22,807
What's the status
of the megs, Tuan?

419
00:24:22,873 --> 00:24:27,312
It appears they've gone deep,
Captain, maybe under the shelf.

420
00:24:27,379 --> 00:24:29,648
They're tough, but they
don't like being shot at.

421
00:24:29,715 --> 00:24:31,115
Readings are unclear,

422
00:24:31,183 --> 00:24:33,851
but they appear
to still be in the area.

423
00:24:33,918 --> 00:24:35,152
So they're hiding.

424
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:36,622
It would seem so, ma'am.

425
00:24:36,688 --> 00:24:39,056
If they're hiding and
not just running away,

426
00:24:39,123 --> 00:24:40,791
that means they're coming back
the moment they recover

427
00:24:40,858 --> 00:24:42,194
from that first shelling.

428
00:24:42,261 --> 00:24:44,962
They're toying
with us like cats.

429
00:24:45,029 --> 00:24:47,266
Killian, what's the status
of the Chinese ship?

430
00:24:47,332 --> 00:24:50,469
Definitely taking
water, Captain.

431
00:24:50,535 --> 00:24:52,271
Tuan and Wilco,
radio them

432
00:24:52,337 --> 00:24:53,871
and see if they're ready
to receive assistance.

433
00:24:53,938 --> 00:24:56,140
Yes, ma'am.

434
00:24:56,208 --> 00:24:57,676
We don't need to make friends,

435
00:24:57,743 --> 00:24:58,909
but I'd like to get
outta here without starting

436
00:24:58,976 --> 00:25:00,379
a world war if possible.

437
00:25:00,445 --> 00:25:01,879
Yes, ma'am.

438
00:25:01,946 --> 00:25:06,451
CNS Tsai, this is SS King.
Do you copy? Over.

439
00:25:06,518 --> 00:25:08,520
CNS Tsai, this is SS King.

440
00:25:08,587 --> 00:25:10,121
Do you copy? Over.

441
00:25:10,188 --> 00:25:11,657
If we don't hear anything
from them in two minutes,

442
00:25:11,723 --> 00:25:13,057
- we're heading out.
- All right, ma'am.

443
00:25:13,124 --> 00:25:14,693
Any status on the survivor?

444
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:15,793
Still unconscious.

445
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:17,028
Are you sure?

446
00:25:17,094 --> 00:25:18,996
Positive, Captain.

447
00:25:19,063 --> 00:25:21,233
I'm getting
nothing back, Captain.

448
00:25:24,503 --> 00:25:25,504
That's long enough.

449
00:25:25,570 --> 00:25:26,571
[beeps]

450
00:25:26,638 --> 00:25:28,640
Captain, we have
a response text.

451
00:25:28,707 --> 00:25:31,410
Only ELF.

452
00:25:31,476 --> 00:25:33,345
What is it?

453
00:25:33,412 --> 00:25:34,746
He wants a parlay.

454
00:25:34,812 --> 00:25:37,882
You and a comms man
and no one else.

455
00:25:40,851 --> 00:25:43,988
We are under no obligation to
accede to any terms, Captain.

456
00:25:44,055 --> 00:25:45,557
I'm not acceding anything.

457
00:25:45,624 --> 00:25:49,494
I'm saving lives on two ships,
300 souls at least.

458
00:25:49,561 --> 00:25:51,929
That is my obligation
and my code.

459
00:25:51,996 --> 00:25:53,365
What is yours?

460
00:25:54,433 --> 00:25:55,634
Yes, ma'am.

461
00:25:55,701 --> 00:25:57,101
Clear the bridge!

462
00:25:59,904 --> 00:26:03,140
We have a secure line, Captain.

463
00:26:08,079 --> 00:26:09,481
Hello, Captain.

464
00:26:09,548 --> 00:26:14,051
I don't believe
I know your name.

465
00:26:14,118 --> 00:26:16,053
Captain Ping is my name.

466
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:18,956
Good to meet you.
I'm Captain Lynch.

467
00:26:19,023 --> 00:26:21,025
I hope you and
your crew are doing well.

468
00:26:24,061 --> 00:26:26,163
We're not, Captain.

469
00:26:26,231 --> 00:26:28,866
We have been attacked.

470
00:26:28,933 --> 00:26:30,067
<i>Yes, we saw.</i>

471
00:26:30,134 --> 00:26:31,436
We tried to assist,
but were afraid

472
00:26:31,503 --> 00:26:35,973
of further mistakenly
damaging your ship.

473
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:37,875
Your lack of action
is tantamount to an attack

474
00:26:37,942 --> 00:26:39,644
on us and our mission, Captain.

475
00:26:39,711 --> 00:26:43,448
We did not sic sharks
on your ship, Captain!

476
00:26:43,515 --> 00:26:46,385
That is not
what the U.S. Navy does!

477
00:26:46,451 --> 00:26:48,253
We have heard otherwise
from the Russians.

478
00:26:51,088 --> 00:26:53,991
We have saved the Russians.

479
00:26:54,058 --> 00:26:56,828
If you've heard anything
but that, you've heard wrong.

480
00:26:56,894 --> 00:26:59,798
There's nothing that can stop
us from our missions, Captain.

481
00:26:59,865 --> 00:27:02,567
Your mission?

482
00:27:02,634 --> 00:27:04,269
Yes.

483
00:27:04,336 --> 00:27:06,772
You should not underestimate
the situation

484
00:27:06,838 --> 00:27:08,640
we are in here, Captain Ping.

485
00:27:08,707 --> 00:27:10,876
We don't know when those
things will come back.

486
00:27:10,941 --> 00:27:14,078
Now I can offer you safe harbor

487
00:27:14,145 --> 00:27:16,113
and provide you transport
until such time as...

488
00:27:16,181 --> 00:27:18,216
We must complete our mission.

489
00:27:18,283 --> 00:27:21,353
I should hope
that your mission would be

490
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:23,422
to save your ship and
your crew, Captain Ping!

491
00:27:23,488 --> 00:27:26,758
Now, like I said,
I can provide you

492
00:27:26,825 --> 00:27:28,926
harbor and offer you transport.

493
00:27:28,993 --> 00:27:33,030
Captain Lynch, I told you
we must complete our missions.

494
00:27:33,097 --> 00:27:34,766
<i>You have two hours
to return our survivor</i>

495
00:27:34,833 --> 00:27:36,468
<i>and depart these waters.</i>

496
00:27:36,535 --> 00:27:40,439
Well, I don't take orders from
anyone but the U.S. government.

497
00:27:40,505 --> 00:27:43,642
Added to that,
you are in our waters,

498
00:27:43,708 --> 00:27:46,378
30 nautical miles off
the coast of San Diego.

499
00:27:46,445 --> 00:27:49,146
So I'll be taking orders
from my Admiral.

500
00:27:49,214 --> 00:27:51,917
But I will pass on
your request to him.

501
00:27:51,982 --> 00:27:54,151
You have two hours.

502
00:27:55,220 --> 00:27:56,621
Get him back, Wilco!

503
00:27:56,688 --> 00:27:58,223
Yes, ma'am.

504
00:27:59,825 --> 00:28:03,060
I didn't believe those
stories about the sharks.

505
00:28:03,127 --> 00:28:05,029
I thought people were
just messing around.

506
00:28:05,095 --> 00:28:06,832
If they keep coming
at us like that...

507
00:28:06,898 --> 00:28:09,166
We're gonna kick their ass!
That's what we're gonna do.

508
00:28:09,234 --> 00:28:12,002
- Back to your stations, people!
- Yes, ma'am!

509
00:28:12,069 --> 00:28:13,103
We have to keep
those things away

510
00:28:13,170 --> 00:28:14,539
from San Diego, no matter what!

511
00:28:14,606 --> 00:28:15,874
Do you mean the sharks
or the Tsai, ma'am?

512
00:28:15,941 --> 00:28:17,309
Both, Tuan.

513
00:28:17,375 --> 00:28:18,910
Be ready for a show
of force, people!

514
00:28:18,976 --> 00:28:21,246
- Yes, Captain!
- Yes, Captain!

515
00:28:21,313 --> 00:28:22,347
Ahearn?

516
00:28:24,182 --> 00:28:26,218
- Ahearn?
- Yes, ma'am?

517
00:28:26,284 --> 00:28:28,420
What's the status
of our survivor?

518
00:28:28,487 --> 00:28:30,422
Well, we...

519
00:28:30,489 --> 00:28:33,023
She's awake, ma'am.

520
00:28:33,090 --> 00:28:34,726
I was gonna say just that.

521
00:28:34,793 --> 00:28:36,994
She's awake, Captain.

522
00:28:37,061 --> 00:28:38,430
Hold the bridge, Ahearn.

523
00:28:38,497 --> 00:28:40,064
Yes, Captain.

524
00:28:45,403 --> 00:28:48,473
Those sharks
attacked your ship

525
00:28:48,540 --> 00:28:50,342
and killed your crew,
didn't they?

526
00:28:54,846 --> 00:28:56,381
What's your name?

527
00:28:59,751 --> 00:29:03,622
Well, I don't know
if you speak English,

528
00:29:03,688 --> 00:29:06,858
but if you do, you should know
we're getting ready to engage

529
00:29:06,925 --> 00:29:08,260
with a Chinese destroyer

530
00:29:08,326 --> 00:29:10,295
that's demanding
we turn you over to them.

531
00:29:11,830 --> 00:29:14,833
What that means is,
we cannot move from this spot

532
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:17,536
without maybe starting a war.

533
00:29:17,602 --> 00:29:19,337
We're sitting here waiting
to be lunch

534
00:29:19,404 --> 00:29:21,506
for three giant sharks
that will return the moment

535
00:29:21,573 --> 00:29:24,009
that they recover from
their last shelling.

536
00:29:24,074 --> 00:29:25,577
So I hope you don't
speak English

537
00:29:25,644 --> 00:29:28,213
and I hope you're not purposely
sitting on information

538
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:30,215
that will be the difference
between two ships

539
00:29:30,282 --> 00:29:32,484
worth of people living
or dying here today!

540
00:29:34,151 --> 00:29:35,387
I hope for
everyone's sake

541
00:29:35,453 --> 00:29:37,087
that all I need to
do right now is go down

542
00:29:37,154 --> 00:29:38,723
and get my translator!

543
00:29:40,090 --> 00:29:42,159
My name's Dr. Lee

544
00:29:43,194 --> 00:29:44,696
and their Armada
is coming for me.

545
00:29:45,964 --> 00:29:47,131
They know about the megalodons

546
00:29:47,198 --> 00:29:48,700
and have been
waiting on standby.

547
00:29:50,001 --> 00:29:52,404
That's why the ships
have been circling.

548
00:29:52,470 --> 00:29:54,506
I knew it wasn't for transit.

549
00:29:56,073 --> 00:29:57,742
The first ship
is just a warning.

550
00:30:02,314 --> 00:30:04,916
They've recovered!

551
00:30:04,983 --> 00:30:06,785
Keep her here, Dr. Ray.

552
00:30:06,851 --> 00:30:08,453
Brace yourselves.

553
00:30:09,621 --> 00:30:10,755
[alarm blares]

554
00:30:10,822 --> 00:30:12,691
Fire! Fire! Fire!

555
00:30:21,566 --> 00:30:23,301
Hell, yeah!
Good shot, boys!

556
00:30:23,368 --> 00:30:25,102
One hell of a shot!

557
00:30:32,944 --> 00:30:35,614
The The Americans are
firing into the water.

558
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:38,550
I don't think they're lying,
about the sharks, sir.

559
00:30:38,617 --> 00:30:42,220
They're fighting them
just like we are...

560
00:30:42,287 --> 00:30:44,022
Should we depart, sir?

561
00:30:44,089 --> 00:30:47,826
Or should we wait for
the armada, sir?

562
00:30:47,892 --> 00:30:49,594
[sighs]

563
00:30:51,930 --> 00:30:53,832
We wait.

564
00:30:56,868 --> 00:30:57,869
Yes, sir.

565
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:10,248
We have a message
already prepared for you,

566
00:31:10,315 --> 00:31:12,384
Captain, both in English
and Mandarin.

567
00:31:12,450 --> 00:31:14,386
Read it back to me.

568
00:31:14,452 --> 00:31:17,489
Communication from Captain Lynch
to Captain Ping.

569
00:31:17,555 --> 00:31:19,724
"At this time after
the near destruction

570
00:31:19,791 --> 00:31:23,028
"of your ship and the imminent
destruction of mine,

571
00:31:23,094 --> 00:31:24,396
"we are in preparations
to return

572
00:31:24,462 --> 00:31:26,798
"to San Diego Naval Base
where the survivor

573
00:31:26,865 --> 00:31:28,033
"will be taken care of.

574
00:31:28,099 --> 00:31:30,035
"And we will work
through diplomatic channels

575
00:31:30,101 --> 00:31:31,403
"to get her back home.

576
00:31:31,469 --> 00:31:34,673
"We cannot take the time
to transfer personnel

577
00:31:34,739 --> 00:31:37,242
"or otherwise engage
without further endangering

578
00:31:37,308 --> 00:31:39,110
"lives in the face
of the megalodons.

579
00:31:39,177 --> 00:31:41,379
"And while what
is clearly damaged

00:31:41,446 --> 00:31:43,748
"and appears to be being
devoured as we speak,

581
00:31:43,815 --> 00:31:45,650
"this present calm
will not last.

582
00:31:45,717 --> 00:31:48,386
"Our offer is not
an act of hostility

00:31:48,453 --> 00:31:49,921
"and should not be
taken as such.

584
00:31:49,988 --> 00:31:53,158
"It is an offer of assistance
and safe harbor.

585
00:31:53,224 --> 00:31:54,626
"If you accompany
us to the harbor,

586
00:31:54,693 --> 00:31:57,128
"we guarantee the safe return
of personnel.

587
00:31:57,195 --> 00:31:59,297
Regards, Captain Lynch."

588
00:32:00,565 --> 00:32:01,700
Send it.

589
00:32:03,334 --> 00:32:05,103
Give me the P.A., Wilco.

590
00:32:05,170 --> 00:32:08,139
Yes, ma'am.
On your comms now.

591
00:32:08,206 --> 00:32:10,809
<i>Crew, this is
your captain speaking.</i>

592
00:32:10,875 --> 00:32:13,179
I have been informed
that a Chinese Armada

593
00:32:13,244 --> 00:32:14,746
will be approaching us.

594
00:32:14,813 --> 00:32:17,183
Report any and all
new sightings of new ships

595
00:32:17,248 --> 00:32:19,284
on the horizon
to myself and your XO.

596
00:32:19,350 --> 00:32:21,119
Thank you.

597
00:32:21,187 --> 00:32:22,454
Is that really happening,
Captain?

598
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:25,023
A Chinese Armada?

599
00:32:25,090 --> 00:32:27,358
Yes, and we have to be prepared.

600
00:32:27,425 --> 00:32:28,960
And even more prepared
when those things

601
00:32:29,027 --> 00:32:30,528
finish eating their friend.

602
00:32:30,595 --> 00:32:32,764
And I have a sense that
it's not gonna satiate them.

603
00:32:32,831 --> 00:32:34,265
On the move, people!

604
00:32:34,332 --> 00:32:35,967
- ASAP! Now!
- You heard the Captain!

605
00:32:36,034 --> 00:32:36,968
ASAP! Let's go!

606
00:32:53,084 --> 00:32:54,285
That was close, Captain.

607
00:32:54,352 --> 00:32:56,254
A warning shot from the Chinese?

608
00:32:56,321 --> 00:32:58,089
We have incoming comms, Captain.

609
00:32:58,156 --> 00:33:00,592
Putting Tuan on now.

610
00:33:00,658 --> 00:33:02,327
They're saying if we move,

611
00:33:02,393 --> 00:33:04,162
it will be perceived
as an act of war.

612
00:33:04,230 --> 00:33:05,764
They're firing on us!

613
00:33:05,830 --> 00:33:07,132
Stop the ship.

614
00:33:07,199 --> 00:33:09,201
They're damaged, ma'am.
We can take them!

615
00:33:09,267 --> 00:33:10,535
<i>Should we engage, ma'am?</i>

616
00:33:10,602 --> 00:33:11,970
Be ready to, Samperio!

617
00:33:12,036 --> 00:33:14,206
We may not have a choice
if they keep firing on us.

618
00:33:14,272 --> 00:33:16,208
We're all set, Captain!

619
00:33:16,274 --> 00:33:18,777
Wilco? Raise Admiral Green.

620
00:33:18,843 --> 00:33:19,778
Yes, ma'am.

621
00:33:19,844 --> 00:33:21,713
He may not want
to hear about this,

622
00:33:21,780 --> 00:33:24,382
but he'll damn sure want to hear
about the Chinese firing on us.

623
00:33:25,650 --> 00:33:28,353
Ahearn, go talk to Dr. Lee.

624
00:33:28,419 --> 00:33:31,356
Captain, I'm sorry,
but who is Dr. Lee?

625
00:33:31,422 --> 00:33:34,926
Our survivor. Find out what she
was really doing here, Ahearn.

626
00:33:34,993 --> 00:33:37,996
If we know that, we'll have
an idea how to stop this war.

627
00:33:38,062 --> 00:33:39,297
Yes, ma'am.

628
00:33:39,364 --> 00:33:41,233
Wilco?
Do you have Admiral Green?

629
00:33:41,299 --> 00:33:42,700
Not yet, ma'am.

630
00:33:42,767 --> 00:33:45,237
Admiral Green is still
in talks with the Chinese.

631
00:33:45,303 --> 00:33:47,572
He's on his jets and...

632
00:33:47,639 --> 00:33:51,743
Everyone with a pay grade
has their asses covered.

633
00:33:51,810 --> 00:33:53,311
Understood.

634
00:33:53,378 --> 00:33:55,046
I think it's time
I phone a friend.

635
00:33:57,782 --> 00:33:58,983
We don't know
where these things are.

636
00:33:59,050 --> 00:34:00,752
We could use some eyes
in the sky.

637
00:34:00,819 --> 00:34:02,221
We're sitting ducks
and the other ducks

638
00:34:02,288 --> 00:34:03,454
are taking pot shots at us!

639
00:34:03,521 --> 00:34:05,123
I'm already on my way.

640
00:34:05,191 --> 00:34:07,792
What? What does that mean?
I thought you were grounded?

641
00:34:07,859 --> 00:34:11,029
Oh, I am,
but my underwater drone isn't.

642
00:34:11,095 --> 00:34:12,864
[chuckles]

643
00:34:12,931 --> 00:34:14,866
I put it in the water
the second our call ended.

644
00:34:14,933 --> 00:34:17,068
It's already 29 miles out
from shore,

645
00:34:17,135 --> 00:34:19,070
which means we should be in
your neck of the woods in about,

646
00:34:19,137 --> 00:34:22,640
I don't know, 20 seconds.

647
00:34:22,707 --> 00:34:24,475
You know if the Admiral
hears about this...

648
00:34:24,542 --> 00:34:25,910
It'll be a bloodbath,
figuratively.

649
00:34:25,977 --> 00:34:28,680
But I'm concerned about
the literal bloodbath

650
00:34:28,746 --> 00:34:31,983
that will occur
if I don't do this.

651
00:34:32,050 --> 00:34:34,220
I can take the consequences,
but all the same,

652
00:34:34,286 --> 00:34:37,589
keep this under wraps with
your crew, if you will, Captain.

653
00:34:37,655 --> 00:34:39,090
Loose lips...
well, you know the rest.

654
00:34:39,157 --> 00:34:40,959
Your secret's safe with me,
Commander.

655
00:34:41,025 --> 00:34:44,362
Good...

656
00:34:44,429 --> 00:34:45,864
Because here we are.

657
00:34:52,837 --> 00:34:55,640
Look at the size of this thing.

658
00:34:57,176 --> 00:34:59,043
We'll have to get around it

659
00:34:59,110 --> 00:35:03,014
and get a picture of
the bigger one, too.

660
00:35:03,081 --> 00:35:04,582
Salles!

661
00:35:06,484 --> 00:35:08,019
What's the status
of the megs, Tuan?

662
00:35:08,086 --> 00:35:10,322
Looks like they're just
getting on the move again,

663
00:35:10,388 --> 00:35:13,259
not coming on strong.

664
00:35:13,325 --> 00:35:16,160
Maybe we put them on notice
again with the last volley.

665
00:35:16,228 --> 00:35:17,795
That's almost good news.

666
00:35:17,862 --> 00:35:20,999
Or they're finishing their
last meal and biding their time.

667
00:35:21,065 --> 00:35:26,738
That's more what I'm used to.

668
00:35:26,804 --> 00:35:29,440
Uh, Captain, one
of the megs is...

669
00:35:29,507 --> 00:35:30,575
What?

670
00:35:30,642 --> 00:35:31,943
Distracted.

671
00:35:32,010 --> 00:35:35,381
Good. Wilco?
Any news on the Admiral yet?

672
00:35:35,446 --> 00:35:36,714
Getting word now, ma'am.

673
00:35:36,781 --> 00:35:38,516
We're being told
to hold our ground.

674
00:35:38,583 --> 00:35:40,386
Hold our ground?

675
00:35:40,451 --> 00:35:41,819
Wilco, do you have the Admiral?

676
00:35:41,886 --> 00:35:44,223
No, ma'am.
Support staff only.

677
00:35:44,290 --> 00:35:46,392
Admiral's in negotiations.

678
00:35:46,457 --> 00:35:47,992
What would you like
us to do, ma'am?

679
00:35:48,059 --> 00:35:50,094
If they move any closer,
hit 'em with all we got.

680
00:35:50,161 --> 00:35:53,097
Hard, fast, all at once,
just like the last time.

681
00:35:53,164 --> 00:35:54,832
We will not move,
but we will not be sitting here

682
00:35:54,899 --> 00:35:56,434
like wounded deer either.

683
00:35:56,501 --> 00:35:59,137
We have a duty to protect
ourselves and the other ship!

684
00:35:59,204 --> 00:36:00,705
Yes, ma'am.

685
00:36:00,772 --> 00:36:02,840
Come on, boys! Let's go!
Let's go! Come on!

686
00:36:09,514 --> 00:36:10,682
Sorry, Commander.

687
00:36:10,748 --> 00:36:12,583
Every time I get close
to the big one,

688
00:36:12,650 --> 00:36:14,253
the small one
blocks off my path.

689
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:15,687
Yeah.

690
00:36:15,753 --> 00:36:18,556
That mini meg is trying
to protect that big beast,

691
00:36:18,623 --> 00:36:20,458
running interference
for it like a yappy dog.

692
00:36:20,525 --> 00:36:21,759
You know what that means?

693
00:36:21,826 --> 00:36:23,161
No, sir.

694
00:36:23,228 --> 00:36:26,332
It means the beast is in charge.

695
00:36:26,398 --> 00:36:28,334
Punch through, Salles.

696
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:31,437
I'm trying to, sir,
but that small one's fast.

697
00:36:31,502 --> 00:36:33,972
Move over. I'm driving.

698
00:36:34,038 --> 00:36:35,207
Yes, sir.

699
00:36:50,289 --> 00:36:55,793
You know, I wanted to catch
you before Captain did,

700
00:36:55,860 --> 00:36:57,528
but I missed my opportunity.

701
00:36:58,796 --> 00:37:01,966
Here's what you should know.

702
00:37:02,033 --> 00:37:04,702
She's a good woman, she is,

703
00:37:04,769 --> 00:37:08,207
a fair woman, the Captain.

704
00:37:08,273 --> 00:37:10,442
She believes that...

705
00:37:10,508 --> 00:37:15,180
everyone is important,
even you,

706
00:37:15,247 --> 00:37:18,250
a Chinese spy...

707
00:37:18,317 --> 00:37:21,552
floating
around American waters.

708
00:37:25,690 --> 00:37:29,527
But see, I'm not like
my Captain, though.

709
00:37:29,594 --> 00:37:32,697
I'm not, hmm?

710
00:37:32,764 --> 00:37:37,702
I'm what you call
a natural born warrior

711
00:37:37,769 --> 00:37:42,307
and I for one hate my enemy.

712
00:37:43,908 --> 00:37:46,412
And make no mistake about it.

713
00:37:46,478 --> 00:37:50,081
You are my enemy, hmm?

714
00:37:52,217 --> 00:37:56,188
See, I'm supposed
to come down here,

715
00:37:56,255 --> 00:38:00,359
try to get you to offer up
your precious spy information.

716
00:38:00,426 --> 00:38:06,265
But, you know, I'm glad
you're not cooperating.

717
00:38:06,331 --> 00:38:09,301
I am, I really am.

718
00:38:09,368 --> 00:38:14,273
Because I'm going to enjoy
throwing you in those waters.

719
00:38:14,339 --> 00:38:18,709
And watching those sharks
tear you limb from limb,

720
00:38:18,776 --> 00:38:23,549
giving us just
enough time to escape.

721
00:38:23,614 --> 00:38:28,753
See, make no mistake about it.

722
00:38:28,820 --> 00:38:33,057
No matter what deal
you get offered,

723
00:38:33,124 --> 00:38:34,859
that's how this ends for you.

724
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:37,161
You hear me?

725
00:38:37,229 --> 00:38:39,364
Any luck, Ahearn?

726
00:38:39,431 --> 00:38:41,366
Not so far, ma'am.

727
00:38:41,433 --> 00:38:43,202
I don't think her
English is so good.

728
00:38:43,268 --> 00:38:44,635
Hmm.

729
00:38:44,702 --> 00:38:45,937
Why don't you take the bridge,

730
00:38:46,003 --> 00:38:48,873
see how we're
doing with those sharks.

731
00:38:48,940 --> 00:38:51,210
Dr. Ray, if you don't
mind stepping out?

732
00:38:51,276 --> 00:38:52,977
Yes, ma'am.

733
00:38:53,044 --> 00:38:55,646
Lee and I need to
do a one-on-one.

734
00:39:18,035 --> 00:39:20,239
I know you can understand me.

735
00:39:20,305 --> 00:39:22,274
But maybe you're afraid
you said too much

736
00:39:22,341 --> 00:39:24,209
the first time we spoke.

737
00:39:24,276 --> 00:39:27,778
But the megs
are coming at us now.

738
00:39:27,845 --> 00:39:30,148
We would be happy to take
you to the other ship.

739
00:39:30,215 --> 00:39:33,185
I will do it myself
in a dinghy if I have to.

740
00:39:33,252 --> 00:39:37,088
But I must know what you
were doing in these waters!

741
00:39:38,823 --> 00:39:41,226
I already know it
must be a spy mission.

742
00:39:41,293 --> 00:39:43,195
But I need to
know more than that.

743
00:39:43,262 --> 00:39:45,763
So here it is.

744
00:39:45,830 --> 00:39:48,433
You either tell me
what I need to know

745
00:39:49,934 --> 00:39:52,003
or we all die with
our secrets here today.

746
00:39:56,774 --> 00:39:58,510
More power, Salles!

747
00:39:58,577 --> 00:40:00,279
We're almost
there, we're almost...

748
00:40:00,345 --> 00:40:01,679
[groans]

749
00:40:10,054 --> 00:40:13,425
Dr. Ray, take Lee to the brig.

750
00:40:13,492 --> 00:40:14,859
Aye, ma'am.

751
00:40:17,862 --> 00:40:19,264
All right.

752
00:40:33,178 --> 00:40:36,515
The moment that big one
comes anywhere near the surface,

753
00:40:36,582 --> 00:40:37,949
drop a bomb on its ass!

754
00:40:38,816 --> 00:40:42,153
Where are they?

755
00:40:42,221 --> 00:40:43,888
They're on the move
again, Captain.

756
00:40:43,955 --> 00:40:45,957
Back to the Tsai?

757
00:40:46,023 --> 00:40:49,894
No, ma'am, away from it,
moving fast.

758
00:40:49,961 --> 00:40:51,896
What?
Where are they going?

759
00:40:51,963 --> 00:40:53,498
[phone vibrates]

760
00:40:55,434 --> 00:40:57,735
Moore! It worked!

761
00:40:57,802 --> 00:40:58,903
It worked too well.

762
00:40:58,970 --> 00:41:01,138
What? What do you mean?

763
00:41:01,206 --> 00:41:04,809
My drone got 'em nice and mad
and dragged them away from you.

764
00:41:04,875 --> 00:41:09,947
But they seemed to have realized
there's nothing to eat in it...

765
00:41:10,014 --> 00:41:12,718
What do you mean, eat, sir?

766
00:41:12,783 --> 00:41:16,355
They're close enough
to smell the cotton candy,

767
00:41:16,421 --> 00:41:19,090
so they're heading
for San Diego.

768
00:41:19,156 --> 00:41:21,526
They're heading for us.

769
00:41:21,593 --> 00:41:23,462
Isn't that great?

770
00:41:30,636 --> 00:41:33,137
We've got to do something.

771
00:41:33,205 --> 00:41:35,006
You can't go out there,
Commander Moore!

772
00:41:38,075 --> 00:41:39,378
Hell if I won't.

773
00:41:40,911 --> 00:41:44,616
If you go out there, you'll
end up in the stockade, sir.

774
00:41:44,683 --> 00:41:48,287
If we don't stop those things
from destroying our ships,

775
00:41:48,353 --> 00:41:51,623
we can't stop the Armada
from storming our shores.

776
00:41:51,690 --> 00:41:53,458
We'll be sitting ducks for
whatever comes for us!

777
00:41:53,525 --> 00:41:58,630
And I will not stay in here
and do nothing.

778
00:41:58,697 --> 00:42:00,064
That's why you won't.

779
00:42:03,368 --> 00:42:07,506
We need your eyes here
helping guide us.

780
00:42:07,572 --> 00:42:11,443
You keep in contact with me,
you'll see what I see.

781
00:42:11,510 --> 00:42:13,010
You'll be with us.

782
00:42:14,212 --> 00:42:15,480
Look, I don't consider
it an upside,

783
00:42:15,547 --> 00:42:17,783
but if those
things do attack the beach,

784
00:42:17,848 --> 00:42:19,850
no one can deny that they exist.

785
00:42:19,917 --> 00:42:21,586
And I'll get footage of it all.

786
00:42:26,625 --> 00:42:29,528
You're a good man, Salles,
you're a good man.

787
00:42:29,594 --> 00:42:30,562
There you go.

788
00:42:32,297 --> 00:42:35,200
And you're my commander, sir,
no matter what they say.

789
00:42:36,133 --> 00:42:38,102
There's no way I can stop them,

790
00:42:38,169 --> 00:42:42,940
but I'll get all
the evidence we need.

791
00:42:43,007 --> 00:42:45,076
Just in case...
Let's blow up some fish.

792
00:42:46,411 --> 00:42:48,846
<i>Salles, PACCOM says our
carriers are tied up</i>

793
00:42:48,913 --> 00:42:51,683
<i>with the Chinese Navy, so air
support is not available.</i>

794
00:42:51,750 --> 00:42:53,185
First platoon one me!

795
00:42:53,251 --> 00:42:55,152
Second platoon, clear that pier!

796
00:42:56,921 --> 00:43:02,093
Destroy those things before
they hit the beaches, Salles!

797
00:43:02,159 --> 00:43:03,094
Let's go!
I got eyes on!

798
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:04,830
We're clear.

799
00:43:04,895 --> 00:43:07,566
<i>Coast guard is still enroute.
You gotta hold 'em off!</i>

800
00:43:07,632 --> 00:43:08,899
Fire!

801
00:43:08,966 --> 00:43:10,602
[gunfire]

802
00:43:18,109 --> 00:43:21,078
Fall back, Salles!
Fall back!

803
00:43:22,913 --> 00:43:24,383
Gah! Go!

804
00:43:24,449 --> 00:43:26,451
First platoon, fall back,
fall back!

805
00:43:26,518 --> 00:43:27,918
<i>Let's go!</i>

806
00:43:27,985 --> 00:43:30,921
Ma'am, the megalodons have
decimated the San Diego Base

807
00:43:30,988 --> 00:43:32,791
and are approaching the beaches.

808
00:43:32,858 --> 00:43:34,959
I'm going to see Dr. Lee.

809
00:43:35,025 --> 00:43:36,160
[clears throat]

810
00:43:36,228 --> 00:43:38,430
Captain?

811
00:43:38,497 --> 00:43:41,065
Should I have Wilco and
Tuan contact the Tsai?

812
00:43:42,501 --> 00:43:43,702
For what reason, Ahearn?

813
00:43:43,769 --> 00:43:47,239
Captain, she is a spy.

814
00:43:50,375 --> 00:43:53,144
Are you suggesting
we throw her overboard?

815
00:43:53,211 --> 00:43:54,579
Make her walk the plank?

816
00:43:54,646 --> 00:43:56,348
Is that what you want us to do?

817
00:43:58,015 --> 00:43:59,518
No, ma'am, not at all.

818
00:43:59,584 --> 00:44:00,786
Good.

819
00:44:00,852 --> 00:44:03,255
Because that's not how
the U.S. Navy operates.

820
00:44:03,321 --> 00:44:05,757
And that's not
how my ship operates.

821
00:44:05,824 --> 00:44:08,527
And it is indeed my ship,
Lieutenant Commander!

822
00:44:08,593 --> 00:44:10,695
We do not throw
inconvenient people

823
00:44:10,762 --> 00:44:12,631
into shark-infested waters!

824
00:44:12,697 --> 00:44:14,932
If we were to defy
orders and cut Dr. Lee

825
00:44:14,999 --> 00:44:18,637
before knowing what she knows,
we would be defying orders.

826
00:44:18,703 --> 00:44:22,106
And that's not the captain I am
nor is it the captain I will be,

827
00:44:22,173 --> 00:44:23,442
no matter what
the circumstances are

828
00:44:23,508 --> 00:44:25,142
or what arguments
have been made!

829
00:44:25,210 --> 00:44:27,945
I follow orders
and so should you!

830
00:44:29,448 --> 00:44:31,650
Yes, Captain.
Understood.

831
00:44:32,950 --> 00:44:34,453
Now let's go break
this woman down

832
00:44:34,519 --> 00:44:37,255
and find out what she knows
so we can get outta here.

833
00:44:40,759 --> 00:44:43,395
[knocking]

834
00:44:55,907 --> 00:44:57,576
Thank you, Ahearn.

835
00:44:59,878 --> 00:45:02,146
You don't need my help, Captain?

836
00:45:02,214 --> 00:45:04,683
You've done exactly what I need.

837
00:45:04,749 --> 00:45:07,786
Return to the bridge.
Take the con.

838
00:45:07,853 --> 00:45:09,488
Yes, Captain.

839
00:45:18,663 --> 00:45:19,931
What are you doing?

840
00:45:19,997 --> 00:45:22,267
He wants to throw you
in the water.

841
00:45:23,768 --> 00:45:27,539
He hasn't said it to me,
but he's ready to do it.

842
00:45:27,606 --> 00:45:30,475
I think a lot of people on this
ship are ready to do it as well,

843
00:45:32,844 --> 00:45:34,913
but I'm in charge.

844
00:45:34,980 --> 00:45:36,181
And I want to send you home,

845
00:45:36,248 --> 00:45:38,048
but we're running
out of options.

846
00:45:40,585 --> 00:45:43,922
I'm not afraid to die
for my country, Captain Lynch.

847
00:45:43,989 --> 00:45:45,357
I am.

848
00:45:46,791 --> 00:45:48,025
Please.

849
00:46:01,239 --> 00:46:04,809
That doesn't mean
I won't do it, but I am.

850
00:46:06,278 --> 00:46:08,179
I'm willing to kill
for my country, too.

851
00:46:11,583 --> 00:46:15,387
But I'm not willing
to sacrifice my honor for it.

852
00:46:15,453 --> 00:46:16,888
Are you willing
to sacrifice your honor

853
00:46:16,955 --> 00:46:18,323
for your country, Dr. Lee?

854
00:46:20,258 --> 00:46:22,761
Because the way
I see it, without honor,

855
00:46:22,827 --> 00:46:26,598
we don't have a country
or a society.

856
00:46:26,665 --> 00:46:28,165
We only have ourselves.

857
00:46:30,535 --> 00:46:35,440
I would die to protect
my country's secrets.

858
00:46:35,507 --> 00:46:38,476
But I will not die
to protect its lies.

859
00:46:38,543 --> 00:46:42,781
A country's lies are a weapon
to be used against its country.

860
00:46:42,847 --> 00:46:45,550
If we make them our lies,

861
00:46:45,617 --> 00:46:48,420
we become weapons
against our own country.

862
00:46:49,854 --> 00:46:52,357
Now something happened here

863
00:46:52,424 --> 00:46:58,263
and it brought those sharks
in like a revenge of sin.

864
00:46:58,330 --> 00:47:00,465
Do you believe
in luck, Dr. Lee?

865
00:47:02,099 --> 00:47:03,335
I do.

866
00:47:03,401 --> 00:47:04,569
Do you believe in bad luck?

867
00:47:07,505 --> 00:47:08,607
I do.

868
00:47:10,875 --> 00:47:14,446
Well, bad luck doesn't
usually follow bad action.

869
00:47:14,512 --> 00:47:16,715
But when it does,
it's the worst kind,

870
00:47:16,781 --> 00:47:19,684
the kind that erases
all the good we ever did.

871
00:47:23,221 --> 00:47:25,323
[static]

872
00:47:31,496 --> 00:47:34,633
Salles, I need a status report.

873
00:47:36,001 --> 00:47:37,669
Talk to me.

874
00:47:37,736 --> 00:47:40,372
Moore, sir,
we were firing, but we lost 'em!

875
00:47:40,438 --> 00:47:42,172
They tore apart both docks

876
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:44,275
and hulled the Vitus
and both battleships!

877
00:47:44,342 --> 00:47:46,177
<i>The Naval base is
completely destroyed.</i>

878
00:47:46,244 --> 00:47:48,145
Get to the beaches, Salles.

879
00:47:48,213 --> 00:47:51,816
Please get to the beaches now.

880
00:47:51,883 --> 00:47:53,251
Oh, my God!

881
00:48:00,925 --> 00:48:04,496
I understand
what you're saying, Captain,

882
00:48:04,562 --> 00:48:07,198
but I'm not going
to betray my country.

883
00:48:11,269 --> 00:48:12,804
There is nothing to betray.

884
00:48:14,372 --> 00:48:15,907
We know your team was spying.

885
00:48:15,974 --> 00:48:20,011
There is no other reason you
were here in the U.S. waters.

886
00:48:20,078 --> 00:48:23,882
You're a scientist,
so you must have developed

887
00:48:23,948 --> 00:48:26,751
a technology to do that spying.

888
00:48:26,818 --> 00:48:29,721
And, well, we know
something exists.

889
00:48:29,788 --> 00:48:31,289
And it's really only
a matter of time

890
00:48:31,356 --> 00:48:33,291
until we realize what it is.

891
00:48:35,794 --> 00:48:39,597
And every second
we waste here in this room,

892
00:48:39,664 --> 00:48:41,566
it's another life on the line.

893
00:48:43,802 --> 00:48:48,006
A child, a parent,
a soldier in San Diego?

894
00:48:48,073 --> 00:48:51,609
Help me save those lives
you put into harm's way!

895
00:48:53,845 --> 00:48:56,881
And I'll do whatever I have
to do to make this go away!

896
00:48:56,948 --> 00:48:58,817
But there
are people dying, Dr. Lee!

897
00:49:13,932 --> 00:49:16,568
Get your officers
to clear the beach!

898
00:49:16,634 --> 00:49:19,003
Get your officers to clear
that beach and do it now!

899
00:49:19,070 --> 00:49:22,273
<i>You saw the video we sent,
you need to act now!</i>

900
00:49:22,340 --> 00:49:24,176
<i>This is the United States
Coast Guard!</i>

901
00:49:24,242 --> 00:49:27,445
<i>All citizens must evacuated
the beaches immediately</i>

902
00:49:27,512 --> 00:49:29,380
Get everyone off the beach!

903
00:49:29,447 --> 00:49:30,715
[gunfire]

904
00:49:32,717 --> 00:49:35,920
Help me save
those people, Dr. Lee.

905
00:49:40,859 --> 00:49:41,793
All right.

906
00:49:43,094 --> 00:49:44,496
All right.

907
00:49:48,032 --> 00:49:51,669
We were acquiring information.

908
00:49:54,873 --> 00:49:55,840
You were hacking.

909
00:49:57,942 --> 00:49:59,043
Satellites.

910
00:49:59,110 --> 00:50:00,745
Our technology.

911
00:50:03,249 --> 00:50:05,251
It drew
the megalodons to us.

912
00:50:05,316 --> 00:50:08,787
It's the sound, I believe.

913
00:50:13,358 --> 00:50:16,427
And can we retrieve it?
Is it still on the ship?

914
00:50:19,364 --> 00:50:20,932
No need to retrieve it.

915
00:50:24,335 --> 00:50:25,904
What do you mean?

916
00:50:40,286 --> 00:50:41,820
We could...

917
00:50:42,787 --> 00:50:47,058
We could save those people...

918
00:50:47,125 --> 00:50:49,627
if you let me help you.

919
00:50:56,434 --> 00:50:57,669
[clamoring]

920
00:51:00,872 --> 00:51:02,373
[gunfire]

921
00:51:08,646 --> 00:51:10,515
The beam is deadly
to most sea creatures.

922
00:51:10,582 --> 00:51:12,150
The sound-wave, in fact,

923
00:51:12,218 --> 00:51:15,187
dis-equilibrates their swim
bladders and even burst them.

924
00:51:15,254 --> 00:51:16,521
But not the sharks?

925
00:51:16,588 --> 00:51:18,056
Not with this power level.

926
00:51:18,122 --> 00:51:21,059
It is possible that it
can damage their inner ears

927
00:51:21,125 --> 00:51:24,796
enough to confuse them with
enough of a pulse, enough time.

928
00:51:24,863 --> 00:51:26,831
Sharks hear much
lower than we do.

929
00:51:26,898 --> 00:51:30,401
This, we believe, is why
they respond to the beamformer.

930
00:51:30,468 --> 00:51:33,104
When you say respond,
you mean it calls them?

931
00:51:33,171 --> 00:51:34,372
And makes them angry.

932
00:51:35,241 --> 00:51:36,641
Wilco?

933
00:51:36,708 --> 00:51:39,677
Can we hook this up to
the P.A. and radio system?

934
00:51:39,744 --> 00:51:43,615
I think I can figure
something out, Captain.

935
00:51:43,681 --> 00:51:45,984
But I have no idea
how this works.

936
00:51:46,050 --> 00:51:48,720
Oh. Lee will help you.

937
00:51:48,786 --> 00:51:50,989
Won't you, Dr. Lee?

938
00:51:51,055 --> 00:51:52,624
I will.

939
00:51:52,690 --> 00:51:55,526
Captain, a word, please?

940
00:51:55,593 --> 00:51:57,528
You're worried, Ahearn.

941
00:51:57,595 --> 00:51:59,731
I do not trust this woman.

942
00:51:59,797 --> 00:52:03,801
Nor should you, but she's
who we need right now.

943
00:52:03,868 --> 00:52:06,404
Without her, a lot
more people in San Diego die.

944
00:52:06,471 --> 00:52:08,940
We gotta call those sharks
back from the San Diego line.

945
00:52:09,007 --> 00:52:10,975
Understood.

946
00:52:11,042 --> 00:52:13,811
Ahearn, you are the most
intelligent, capable officer

947
00:52:13,878 --> 00:52:15,480
I've ever worked with.

948
00:52:15,546 --> 00:52:17,782
I need you to be exactly
who you are

949
00:52:17,849 --> 00:52:19,484
while still doing
what needs to get done.

950
00:52:19,550 --> 00:52:20,685
Understand?

951
00:52:20,752 --> 00:52:22,453
Understood, Captain.

952
00:52:22,520 --> 00:52:24,256
Good man.

953
00:52:24,323 --> 00:52:25,924
Keep an eye on the Tsai for me.

954
00:52:25,990 --> 00:52:27,293
I'll be on this.

955
00:52:27,359 --> 00:52:28,860
Understood, ma'am.

956
00:52:31,330 --> 00:52:33,097
Are we ready?

957
00:52:33,164 --> 00:52:36,368
Uh, we're having
to cross-strap a lot of stuff.

958
00:52:36,434 --> 00:52:38,169
Will we be ready soon?

959
00:52:38,237 --> 00:52:39,837
We will.

960
00:52:41,572 --> 00:52:42,840
Samperio?

961
00:52:42,907 --> 00:52:45,109
If what Lee says is correct,

962
00:52:45,177 --> 00:52:47,712
those things will be
coming in hot and confused.

963
00:52:47,779 --> 00:52:50,548
Ready your team to blow
the last two out of the water.

964
00:52:50,615 --> 00:52:52,450
I want teeth for the hood
of my car.

965
00:52:52,517 --> 00:52:54,152
[gunfire]

966
00:52:55,720 --> 00:52:57,488
Of the beach!

967
00:53:05,763 --> 00:53:08,833
Yeah, I think...
I think we're ready, Captain.

968
00:53:08,900 --> 00:53:10,034
All right.

969
00:53:17,008 --> 00:53:18,142
[beeps]

970
00:53:25,317 --> 00:53:27,319
I don't understand
what I'm looking at here.

971
00:53:27,386 --> 00:53:29,821
I do.

972
00:53:29,887 --> 00:53:32,557
Captain, should I let
her use the terminal?

973
00:53:32,623 --> 00:53:35,126
Explain everything, Dr. Lee,
or it's back to the brig.

974
00:53:37,262 --> 00:53:39,431
We are probing for data packets.

975
00:53:39,497 --> 00:53:41,799
It's the only way the system
is designed to work.

976
00:53:43,534 --> 00:53:44,969
We have to hack.

977
00:53:45,036 --> 00:53:46,137
We do.

978
00:53:46,205 --> 00:53:48,273
Shall I tell it
to access, Captain?

979
00:53:48,340 --> 00:53:50,242
That's the only way it
can reach enough capacity

980
00:53:50,309 --> 00:53:53,111
to bring the megalodons back.

981
00:53:53,178 --> 00:53:54,746
Yes, do it.

982
00:54:01,119 --> 00:54:02,053
Did it work?

983
00:54:02,120 --> 00:54:03,621
Something wrong?

984
00:54:03,688 --> 00:54:05,623
It's not connecting!

985
00:54:07,326 --> 00:54:08,659
I think it's out of synch.

986
00:54:08,726 --> 00:54:11,662
One of these connections
isn't working properly.

987
00:54:11,729 --> 00:54:12,730
We can patch it.

988
00:54:12,797 --> 00:54:14,766
No. If you patch one unit,

989
00:54:14,832 --> 00:54:16,201
then we have to resynch
the whole system!

990
00:54:16,268 --> 00:54:18,736
Whatever we need to do,
do it fast and do it now!

991
00:54:18,803 --> 00:54:20,538
- Let's go!
- Yes, ma'am.

992
00:54:31,582 --> 00:54:33,519
Salles?

993
00:54:33,584 --> 00:54:34,952
Salles!

994
00:54:40,124 --> 00:54:42,026
The Tsai looks
pretty bad, Captain.

995
00:54:43,661 --> 00:54:44,796
How long will this take?

996
00:54:45,663 --> 00:54:48,400
Five minutes at least!

997
00:54:48,467 --> 00:54:50,968
We don't have five minutes!

998
00:54:51,035 --> 00:54:52,703
People are dying, Captain!

999
00:54:52,770 --> 00:54:54,339
Step off the bridge, Mr. Ahearn.

1000
00:54:54,406 --> 00:54:55,907
We are screwing around!

1001
00:54:55,973 --> 00:54:58,042
We should be saving lives,
not trusting our enemies!

1002
00:54:58,109 --> 00:55:01,280
Step off the bridge!
That is an order!

1003
00:55:01,346 --> 00:55:02,880
Aye, Captain!

1004
00:55:02,947 --> 00:55:05,750
The only enemies are
the megalodons and ourselves!

1005
00:55:05,817 --> 00:55:07,118
That is it!

1007
00:55:16,495 --> 00:55:17,929

Almost there!

00:55:52,897 --> 00:55:54,433
It looks good, looks good.

1011
00:55:54,500 --> 00:55:56,335
We're ready.

1012
00:55:56,401 --> 00:55:57,768
Press the button, Dr. Lee.

1013
00:56:01,139 --> 00:56:02,574
[beeping]

1014
00:56:02,640 --> 00:56:06,844
Do we need to resynch it again?

1015
00:56:06,911 --> 00:56:09,214
It should work!
It's connected everywhere!

1016
00:56:11,682 --> 00:56:13,784
Let me try something...

1017
00:56:17,722 --> 00:56:19,291
I thought that would work.

1018
00:56:22,528 --> 00:56:23,761
You're doing so good.

1019
00:56:25,163 --> 00:56:29,201
You're like a super genius
or something, you know.

1023
00:56:45,883 --> 00:56:47,985
Is it supposed to do this?

1024
00:56:48,052 --> 00:56:51,256
Yes! The vibrations are low!
We can still do damage!

1025
00:57:04,436 --> 00:57:07,071
What is the status?

1026
00:57:07,138 --> 00:57:10,107
I believe the connections
worked, ma'am.

1027
00:57:10,174 --> 00:57:12,877
Tuan, do you see
anything on the radar?

1028
00:57:14,779 --> 00:57:17,748
The radar is
unresponsive, Captain.

1029
00:57:18,617 --> 00:57:20,219
Try rebooting it.

1030
00:57:20,285 --> 00:57:21,953
Wilco, how's your terminal?

1031
00:57:22,019 --> 00:57:24,822
Completely unresponsive
as well, ma'am.

1032
00:57:24,889 --> 00:57:27,492
I need eyes on windows!
I need eyes everywhere!

1035
00:57:48,779 --> 00:57:49,981
Okay.

1036
00:57:55,953 --> 00:57:58,457
Captain, enemy ships
are approaching!

1037
00:58:00,192 --> 00:58:01,859
Not now!

00:58:34,559 --> 00:58:37,061
Battle stations!
All crew to battle stations!

1046
00:58:37,128 --> 00:58:38,863
Battle stations now!

Come on.
Come on, don't do it.

Any word from Admiral Green?

00:59:33,452 --> 00:59:35,886
He's still talking to the
Chinese, but our orders stand.

1059
00:59:35,953 --> 00:59:38,022
Our do-nothing orders?

1060
00:59:51,403 --> 00:59:53,839
Are they sending anyone to us?

1061
00:59:53,904 --> 00:59:55,106
Status quo, ma'am.

1062
00:59:55,172 --> 00:59:57,108
The jets, they're
ready to deploy.

1063
00:59:57,174 --> 00:59:59,009
But we don't have an update yet.

1064
00:59:59,076 --> 01:00:01,646
Wire the Admiral again.
We need help.

1065
01:00:01,713 --> 01:00:03,215
Yes, ma'am.

1066
01:00:30,842 --> 01:00:32,210
Ma'am...

1067
01:00:50,829 --> 01:00:52,564
This is my father's knife.

1068
01:00:52,631 --> 01:00:56,501
He carried it with him all
the way through Vietnam.

1069
01:00:56,568 --> 01:01:01,273
But I've dishonored him and
his memory by thinking of myself

1070
01:01:01,339 --> 01:01:04,242
instead of my crew
and my captain.

1071
01:01:04,309 --> 01:01:08,413
If you would have me, Captain,
I would like to retake my post.

1072
01:01:12,784 --> 01:01:17,189
Permission granted, Ahearn,
and not a moment too soon.

1073
01:01:17,255 --> 01:01:18,623
We're getting ready
to join this fight.

1074
01:01:18,690 --> 01:01:21,158
The other ships need us.

1075
01:01:21,226 --> 01:01:22,427
Thank you, Captain.

1076
01:01:24,329 --> 01:01:26,063
Killian, get us going.

1077
01:01:26,130 --> 01:01:27,699
Yes, ma'am.

1078
01:01:33,438 --> 01:01:35,005
[clamoring]

1079
01:01:57,796 --> 01:02:00,932
We hit the small one!
One hell of a shot, boys!

1080
01:02:00,998 --> 01:02:03,000
Lay him up! Yeah!

1081
01:02:10,074 --> 01:02:12,142
We're hit, men! We're hit!

1082
01:02:12,210 --> 01:02:13,178
<i>Shoot that thing!</i>

1083
01:02:13,245 --> 01:02:14,579
<i>Shoot that shark down now!</i>

1084
01:02:25,122 --> 01:02:27,259
He's going down!
He's going down!

1085
01:02:28,158 --> 01:02:30,762
The Tsai put a bullet in him!

1086
01:02:30,829 --> 01:02:33,398
Hell, yeah!

1087
01:02:33,465 --> 01:02:35,700
Ma'am, the lower deck
tells me that

1088
01:02:35,767 --> 01:02:37,969
they're sustaining
a lot of damage!

1089
01:02:38,035 --> 01:02:39,271
How bad?

1090
01:02:39,337 --> 01:02:41,171
Manageable, ma'am...
they think.

1091
01:02:41,239 --> 01:02:42,440
They're working on it now.

1092
01:02:43,742 --> 01:02:45,510
Captain Lynch! Ahead!

1093
01:02:47,245 --> 01:02:49,414
It's coming right at us!

1094
01:02:49,481 --> 01:02:50,682
Fire!

1095
01:02:54,486 --> 01:02:56,888
I'm not seeing any
lone survivors, ma'am.

1096
01:02:56,955 --> 01:02:58,723
Well, keep an eye out, Tuan.

1097
01:02:58,790 --> 01:03:00,425
Yes, ma'am.

1098
01:03:00,492 --> 01:03:03,328
It's time to move outta here
before the other one comes back.

1099
01:03:03,395 --> 01:03:06,130
Wilco, what's our comm
situation?

1100
01:03:06,197 --> 01:03:08,366
No comms,
but ELF only, ma'am.

1101
01:03:08,433 --> 01:03:11,636
Tell Ping we're ready
to give back Dr. Lee.

1102
01:03:11,703 --> 01:03:13,271
Yes, ma'am.

1103
01:03:13,338 --> 01:03:14,906
And our previous
offer still stands.

1104
01:03:14,973 --> 01:03:18,610
The beast is still out there
and these waters are not safe.

1105
01:03:18,677 --> 01:03:20,345
Yes, ma'am.

1106
01:03:21,646 --> 01:03:23,415
Are you ready
to go home, Dr. Lee?

1107
01:03:25,784 --> 01:03:28,520
Yes, I think I will.

1108
01:03:28,587 --> 01:03:30,322
It's safer for you that I do.

1109
01:03:34,759 --> 01:03:37,228
Think about what's best to
help your country, Dr. Lee.

1110
01:03:38,496 --> 01:03:40,298
That's the idea, Captain.

1111
01:03:42,334 --> 01:03:44,002
All right! All right!
Let's go, people!

1112
01:03:44,069 --> 01:03:46,271
These waters aren't safe and
the shark's still out there!

1113
01:03:46,338 --> 01:03:47,672
Let's go!

1114
01:03:56,281 --> 01:03:58,283
The ships are going down!

1115
01:04:01,219 --> 01:04:03,855
Change of plans!
We have to destroy that thing!

1116
01:04:03,922 --> 01:04:05,657
- Fire!
- Fire!

1117
01:04:09,761 --> 01:04:12,230
Full steam ahead!
Let's catch that thing!

1118
01:04:12,297 --> 01:04:13,565
Yes, ma'am.

1119
01:04:15,400 --> 01:04:17,402
Fire, fire, fire!

1120
01:04:31,049 --> 01:04:33,918
Survivors! Survivors!
Let's bring 'em up!

1121
01:04:35,120 --> 01:04:37,555
Let's go! Let's go!

1122
01:04:37,622 --> 01:04:38,790
Come on, come on!
Let's go, let's go!

1123
01:04:38,857 --> 01:04:40,191
Come on!

1124
01:04:46,464 --> 01:04:47,866
Ahearn, Ensign Brand,

1125
01:04:47,932 --> 01:04:49,801
Get them inside and
make them comfortable.

1126
01:04:52,337 --> 01:04:54,171
We need to get to
shore, ASAP.

1127
01:04:54,239 --> 01:04:55,573
Yes, ma'am.

1128
01:04:55,640 --> 01:04:57,509
Full steam ahead,
that thing is coming back,

1129
01:04:57,575 --> 01:04:59,244
and we need to get to port
before it catches us.

1130
01:04:59,310 --> 01:05:00,612
<i>Samperio, keep your gunners
on their toes.</i>

1131
01:05:00,679 --> 01:05:01,880
<i>We are our most vulnerable.</i>

1132
01:05:01,946 --> 01:05:03,548
<i>We need to take that shark out.</i>

1133
01:05:03,615 --> 01:05:05,417
Ma'am, we're out of ammo.
We've got nothing left.

1134
01:05:10,288 --> 01:05:11,489
I need eyes on that shark, Tuan!

1135
01:05:11,556 --> 01:05:13,525
Sonar's still a little...

1136
01:05:13,591 --> 01:05:15,460
Got it! Circling, moving
out fast!

1137
01:05:15,527 --> 01:05:17,195
We don't have long!
Let's go!

1138
01:05:17,262 --> 01:05:19,597
Engineering says the ship
doesn't have long either, ma'am.

1139
01:05:19,664 --> 01:05:21,866
We took an eye out, Captain.

1140
01:05:21,933 --> 01:05:23,234
Look, we got handguns
and rifles.

1141
01:05:23,301 --> 01:05:25,904
We can still take
this thing down.

1142
01:05:25,970 --> 01:05:27,238
That was a lucky shot, Samperio!

1143
01:05:27,305 --> 01:05:28,840
I don't expect we'll
get another one,

1144
01:05:28,907 --> 01:05:30,408
but let's ready
the weapons just in case.

1145
01:05:30,475 --> 01:05:31,876
<i>Yes, ma'am.</i>

1146
01:05:31,943 --> 01:05:33,411
Killian, can we make it
before those things come back?

1147
01:05:33,478 --> 01:05:34,879
I'm not hopeful
with that, Captain.

1148
01:05:34,946 --> 01:05:36,581
These things are fast
and we're injured badly.

1149
01:05:36,648 --> 01:05:39,185
- Ahearn?
- Yes, ma'am.

1150
01:05:39,250 --> 01:05:40,719
Take the con!

1151
01:05:40,785 --> 01:05:42,754
Killian, keep moving
for land as fast as we can go!

1152
01:05:42,821 --> 01:05:43,922
Yes, ma'am.

1153
01:05:43,988 --> 01:05:45,757
Samperio, the moment
we see that thing...

1154
01:05:45,824 --> 01:05:49,294
We'll go after it hand to
hand if we have to, Captain!

1155
01:05:49,360 --> 01:05:50,595
Follow me, Dr. Lee.

1156
01:06:11,416 --> 01:06:13,151
I have nothing to say
to you, Captain.

1157
01:06:13,219 --> 01:06:14,519
Then just listen.

1158
01:06:14,586 --> 01:06:18,056
Our ship is badly damaged,
possibly sunk.

1159
01:06:18,123 --> 01:06:20,658
I'm just trying to
save everybody's lives,

1160
01:06:20,725 --> 01:06:22,827
including yours.

1161
01:06:22,894 --> 01:06:24,929
Now my government won't
step in because your government

1162
01:06:24,996 --> 01:06:27,532
will consider it an act of war.

1163
01:06:27,599 --> 01:06:30,168
I need your help.

1164
01:06:30,236 --> 01:06:32,670
What kind of help?

1165
01:06:32,737 --> 01:06:35,273
Well, that's just the thing.

1166
01:06:35,340 --> 01:06:38,443
I'm a captain and so are you.

1167
01:06:38,510 --> 01:06:39,911
I think the reason
that we lost to it

1168
01:06:39,978 --> 01:06:42,380
is because we were fighting
alone and not together.

1169
01:06:42,447 --> 01:06:46,451
What would you do if
you were me, Captain Ping?

1170
01:06:46,518 --> 01:06:48,353
I don't understand
your question.

1171
01:06:48,419 --> 01:06:50,088
I'm saying if someone
on your team

1172
01:06:50,155 --> 01:06:52,224
must have worked
on this project.

1173
01:06:52,290 --> 01:06:56,694
And someone must have faced
off with this thing before.

1174
01:06:56,761 --> 01:06:58,463
Those things have
a real vendetta

1175
01:06:58,530 --> 01:07:01,866
against your ships
and now ours, too.

1176
01:07:01,933 --> 01:07:04,736
Now the beamformer.

1177
01:07:04,803 --> 01:07:07,338
It must disorient them,
distract them.

1178
01:07:07,405 --> 01:07:09,073
I know it draws
them to the tech,

1179
01:07:09,140 --> 01:07:10,942
but I don't think they like it.

1180
01:07:11,009 --> 01:07:13,044
I don't know what
you mean... beamformer.

1181
01:07:28,059 --> 01:07:30,595
Where is your ship, Dr. Lee?

1182
01:07:36,568 --> 01:07:40,905
If you can take us to
the ship, I can help you.

1183
01:07:42,407 --> 01:07:44,509
Follow me to the bridge,
Captain Ping.

1184
01:07:59,424 --> 01:08:00,859
What the hell did they just say?

1185
01:08:00,925 --> 01:08:02,827
I had no idea what the hell
did they just said.

1186
01:08:16,507 --> 01:08:18,277
This is our sense.

1187
01:08:18,344 --> 01:08:20,945
It kills aquatic life
in its path...

1188
01:08:21,012 --> 01:08:22,814
I see.

1189
01:08:22,881 --> 01:08:26,218
And yet the megalodons
appears to be...

1190
01:08:26,285 --> 01:08:27,585
Attracted to it...

1191
01:08:27,652 --> 01:08:30,322
Although the
ship might be sunk,

1192
01:08:30,388 --> 01:08:34,092
but it appears that the SAT
tech might still be alive.

1193
01:08:36,160 --> 01:08:39,931
It might help us... perhaps.

1194
01:08:41,399 --> 01:08:44,303
Crew, this is Captain Ping.

1195
01:08:44,370 --> 01:08:47,772
He's going to help us...
not die.

1196
01:08:47,839 --> 01:08:50,309
Tuan, are we still receiving the
signal from their sunken ship?

1197
01:08:50,376 --> 01:08:51,476
Yes, ma'am.

1198
01:08:51,542 --> 01:08:55,113
Captain Ping, what do we do?

1199
01:08:55,180 --> 01:08:57,582
We must go to it.

1200
01:08:57,649 --> 01:08:59,951
We must use its
beamform technology

1201
01:09:00,018 --> 01:09:02,354
to destroy them.

1202
01:09:02,420 --> 01:09:03,554
Killian?

1203
01:09:03,621 --> 01:09:05,123
Set a course
for the sunken ship.

1204
01:09:05,190 --> 01:09:06,791
That's the opposite direction
off the coast, Captain.

1205
01:09:06,858 --> 01:09:09,160
Yes, it is, Killian.
Let's go.

1206
01:09:09,228 --> 01:09:10,828
Yes, ma'am.

1207
01:09:10,895 --> 01:09:12,630
Ma'am! The engine crew
is saying that

1208
01:09:12,697 --> 01:09:14,032
we're taking on a lot of water.

1209
01:09:14,098 --> 01:09:15,867
They are not sure
how long we can make it.

1210
01:09:15,934 --> 01:09:19,371
We got about a one in a million
shot to survive this, people.

1211
01:09:19,437 --> 01:09:22,540
But it's the only one we got,
so we're gonna take it.

1212
01:09:22,607 --> 01:09:25,576
Killian, turn us around.

1213
01:09:30,014 --> 01:09:32,083
Now you think
Lee's device will be able to...

1214
01:09:32,150 --> 01:09:33,851
Connect to the device
on the sunken ship.

1215
01:09:33,918 --> 01:09:38,756
And this whole ship will become
some kind of transponder.

1216
01:09:38,823 --> 01:09:42,126
I don't know what will
happen to us nor its ship.

1217
01:09:44,095 --> 01:09:45,997
Captain Ping...

1218
01:09:46,064 --> 01:09:47,598
If we do this, it will destroy
all the information

1219
01:09:47,665 --> 01:09:49,667
that we gathered.

1220
01:09:49,734 --> 01:09:51,502
[speaking Mandarin]

1221
01:09:51,569 --> 01:09:53,705
You've got to
be kidding me.

1222
01:09:53,771 --> 01:09:55,707
Is there something wrong,
Killian?

1223
01:09:55,773 --> 01:09:57,775
They're speaking in code, sir.

1224
01:09:57,842 --> 01:09:59,411
It's Mandarin, Killian.

1225
01:09:59,477 --> 01:10:02,013
It's a language spoken by
billions all over the world.

1226
01:10:02,080 --> 01:10:03,481
Just because
you don't understand it

1227
01:10:03,548 --> 01:10:05,016
doesn't mean it's code.

1228
01:10:05,083 --> 01:10:06,918
They could be leading
us into a trap,

1229
01:10:06,985 --> 01:10:09,254
trying to protect whatever's on
that ship from being discovered.

1230
01:10:09,321 --> 01:10:10,755
I trust the Captain

1231
01:10:10,822 --> 01:10:13,558
and the Captain trusts them,
so I trust them.

1232
01:10:15,526 --> 01:10:17,161
You got a problem
with that, sailor?

1233
01:10:19,365 --> 01:10:20,531
No, sir.

1234
01:10:20,598 --> 01:10:21,933
Good.

1235
01:10:24,002 --> 01:10:25,036
Ahearn?

1236
01:10:25,103 --> 01:10:26,637
What's the update on
Engineering?

1237
01:10:26,704 --> 01:10:27,672
Been better, ma'am.

1238
01:10:27,739 --> 01:10:29,007
Are we sinking?

1239
01:10:29,073 --> 01:10:29,941
Not yet, ma'am.

1240
01:10:30,008 --> 01:10:32,143
I'll call that a win for now.

1241
01:10:32,211 --> 01:10:34,679
Wilco, do you and
Lee have that thing set up?

1242
01:10:34,746 --> 01:10:35,747
I do, ma'am.

1243
01:10:35,813 --> 01:10:37,882
But when we turn
this thing on...

1244
01:10:37,949 --> 01:10:40,185
Yes?

1245
01:10:40,252 --> 01:10:44,589
We're gonna lose al our comms,
probably much more than that.

1246
01:10:44,655 --> 01:10:46,591
Understood, Wilco.

1247
01:10:50,028 --> 01:10:52,764
<i>Target has been spotted, ma'am.
The beast is in sight.</i>

1248
01:10:52,830 --> 01:10:54,732
Fire a warning shot, Samperio!

1249
01:10:54,799 --> 01:10:56,534
Keep those things distracted!

1250
01:10:56,601 --> 01:10:57,769
Yes, ma'am.

1251
01:11:11,549 --> 01:11:13,017
Again, Samperio!

1252
01:11:13,084 --> 01:11:15,553
It's my last shot, ma'am.

1253
01:11:15,620 --> 01:11:16,954
You want me to take it?

1254
01:11:19,191 --> 01:11:20,691
No.

1255
01:11:20,758 --> 01:11:22,093
We don't know if this will work

1256
01:11:22,160 --> 01:11:24,629
and we'll need everything
we got left.

1257
01:11:24,695 --> 01:11:26,097
Yes, ma'am.

1258
01:11:26,164 --> 01:11:28,534
Ma'am, we're just
over the top of it.

1259
01:11:28,599 --> 01:11:33,338
While we're here, we cannot move
our positions, no matter what.

1260
01:11:34,972 --> 01:11:36,107
It will disrupt the connection.

1261
01:11:39,244 --> 01:11:42,013
Well, screw it.
Turn on the device.

1262
01:11:43,881 --> 01:11:45,284
Yes, ma'am.

1263
01:11:47,652 --> 01:11:48,820
[beeps]

1264
01:12:03,101 --> 01:12:04,203
Are you okay?

1265
01:12:04,269 --> 01:12:05,370
I'm good.

1266
01:12:37,101 --> 01:12:40,171
Any sign of it?

1267
01:12:40,239 --> 01:12:41,739
No sign of it.

1268
01:12:41,806 --> 01:12:42,773
Must be way down there.

1269
01:12:42,840 --> 01:12:44,276
Or dead...

1270
01:12:46,378 --> 01:12:47,346
We need to be sure.

1271
01:12:57,989 --> 01:12:59,358
Ma'am, it's...

1272
01:12:59,424 --> 01:13:01,792
It didn't work!
That shark's still alive.

1273
01:13:04,762 --> 01:13:07,466
We're dead!
We're all dead!

1274
01:13:07,533 --> 01:13:09,434
No, no, we're not.

1275
01:13:11,169 --> 01:13:12,870
Not yet.

1276
01:13:12,937 --> 01:13:15,706
Battle stations!
Battle stations!

1277
01:13:17,808 --> 01:13:18,876
Let's go!
Battle stations!

1278
01:13:18,943 --> 01:13:20,312
[alarm blares]

1279
01:13:29,086 --> 01:13:31,557
Arm yourselves!
We have to be ready!

1280
01:13:31,623 --> 01:13:33,392
Let's go! Let's go!

1281
01:13:34,926 --> 01:13:36,428
Battle stations!
Come on!

1282
01:13:36,495 --> 01:13:38,162
Let's go! Battle stations!

1283
01:13:38,230 --> 01:13:40,131
Let's do this!
Battle stations!

1284
01:13:40,199 --> 01:13:41,300
Come on!

1285
01:13:46,605 --> 01:13:47,905
Let's go, people!
Come on!

1286
01:13:47,972 --> 01:13:49,073
Let's get 'em!

1287
01:13:49,140 --> 01:13:50,375
Let's get 'em!
Come on!

1288
01:13:50,442 --> 01:13:51,776
Let's get 'em!

1289
01:13:51,842 --> 01:13:54,246
Eyes to the sea!
Eyes to the sea! Let's go!

1290
01:14:13,798 --> 01:14:14,932
Get ready, y'all.

1291
01:14:20,405 --> 01:14:22,474
[gunfire]

1292
01:14:22,541 --> 01:14:23,941
Let's go, boys!

1293
01:14:24,008 --> 01:14:25,510
[grunting, shouting]

1294
01:14:31,283 --> 01:14:33,518
- Wilco!
- No!

1295
01:14:37,522 --> 01:14:38,457
No!

1296
01:14:40,459 --> 01:14:42,394
[screams]

1297
01:14:52,036 --> 01:14:54,772
Where is it?
Anybody see it?

1298
01:14:54,839 --> 01:14:57,442
Does anybody see it?

1299
01:14:57,509 --> 01:14:58,577
Disappeared.

1300
01:14:58,644 --> 01:15:00,778
It must be underneath us!

1301
01:15:00,845 --> 01:15:02,547
It's gonna hull us,
drag us down!

1302
01:15:28,839 --> 01:15:30,041
It stopped.

1303
01:15:30,107 --> 01:15:31,410
It knows we're dead.

1304
01:15:31,476 --> 01:15:33,445
It's waiting for us
to climb out.

1305
01:15:33,512 --> 01:15:34,446
We're gonna be lunch.

1306
01:15:37,982 --> 01:15:39,384
I'll stay aboard
and distract it.

1307
01:15:39,451 --> 01:15:40,719
Everybody go!

1308
01:15:40,786 --> 01:15:42,987
Like I'm leaving you,
Captain... or anyone else.

1309
01:15:48,593 --> 01:15:51,162
Head to engineering!
Have them rev the engines!

1310
01:15:51,229 --> 01:15:52,930
Bring that thing back to us!

1311
01:16:05,444 --> 01:16:07,646
Here it comes!

1312
01:16:07,713 --> 01:16:09,648
Wait for it to come close!

1313
01:16:09,715 --> 01:16:11,082
Whites of the eyes, people!

1314
01:16:17,255 --> 01:16:18,523
2:00!

1315
01:16:20,759 --> 01:16:22,594
[shouting]

1316
01:16:31,902 --> 01:16:33,904
What happened, Captain?

1317
01:16:33,971 --> 01:16:35,507
Something hit it.

1318
01:16:39,177 --> 01:16:40,945
It's Commander Moore's sub!

1319
01:16:48,787 --> 01:16:50,222
He's heading for the megalodon!

1320
01:16:53,258 --> 01:16:55,527
Okay, you big giant...

1321
01:17:03,735 --> 01:17:05,303
The ship's going down, Captain!

1322
01:17:05,370 --> 01:17:08,573
Are there any more
lifeboats, Ahearn?

1323
01:17:08,640 --> 01:17:10,242
No, ma'am.

1324
01:17:17,349 --> 01:17:21,186
Do you think Commander Moore
killed it... or it killed him?

1325
01:17:21,253 --> 01:17:23,321
I think we're gonna
find out very soon!

1326
01:17:23,388 --> 01:17:26,425
Give it everything you got!

1327
01:17:26,491 --> 01:17:28,159
Get ready for it!

1328
01:17:40,037 --> 01:17:41,071
[laughing]

1329
01:17:41,138 --> 01:17:42,474
I'd have brought a bigger boat

1330
01:17:42,541 --> 01:17:44,609
if I'd known
there'd been any left!

1331
01:17:46,143 --> 01:17:48,346
We won, baby! We won!

1332
01:17:48,413 --> 01:17:50,315
Yes!

1333
01:17:50,382 --> 01:17:51,982
Thank you!

1334
01:17:52,049 --> 01:17:53,685
That's what
I'm talking about, baby!

1335
01:17:58,924 --> 01:18:00,325
I love this thing.

1336
01:18:00,392 --> 01:18:04,496
Hoo-rah. Okay, fishes,
it's a watery grave.

1337
01:18:04,563 --> 01:18:05,597
We're goin' in.

1338
01:18:05,664 --> 01:18:07,699
Abandon ship!
Let's go, people!

1339
01:18:13,472 --> 01:18:16,241
We lost a lot of
good people today.

1340
01:18:16,308 --> 01:18:19,377
If it weren't for the bravery
from both my crew

1341
01:18:19,444 --> 01:18:21,580
and the many men
and women of San Diego,

1342
01:18:21,646 --> 01:18:24,014
as well as members
of the Chinese Navy,

1343
01:18:24,081 --> 01:18:27,252
far more destruction would have
been wrought by these creatures.

1344
01:18:27,319 --> 01:18:28,854
Excuse me, Captain Lynch.

1345
01:18:28,920 --> 01:18:31,957
Were you aware of the existence
of more of these creatures?

1346
01:18:32,022 --> 01:18:34,192
We've officially
seen no evidence

1347
01:18:34,259 --> 01:18:35,494
that there are any
more of these megalodons.

1348
01:18:35,560 --> 01:18:37,529
Officially seen?

1349
01:18:37,596 --> 01:18:39,063
That is correct.

1350
01:18:39,129 --> 01:18:40,465
But you weren't
officially aware of these three

1351
01:18:40,532 --> 01:18:42,534
before they
demolished the base.

1352
01:18:42,601 --> 01:18:46,136
So how do we know
there aren't more out there?

1353
01:18:46,204 --> 01:18:49,441
We don't.

1354
01:18:51,877 --> 01:18:53,545
There are rumors that
you're tagging and tracking

1355
01:18:53,612 --> 01:18:56,348
undersea objects and there
may be more megalodons.

1356
01:18:56,414 --> 01:18:58,650
I don't comment on rumors.

1357
01:18:58,717 --> 01:19:01,186
Captain Lynch, care to
comment on your sister's case?

1358
01:19:01,253 --> 01:19:03,889
What were Chinese ships
doing in U.S. waters?

1359
01:19:03,955 --> 01:19:04,890
Are we going to war?

1360
01:19:04,956 --> 01:19:06,458
Thank you.

1361
01:19:06,525 --> 01:19:08,058
That is all I have to say
about this at the present time.

1362
01:19:08,125 --> 01:19:09,995
- Captain Lynch...
- Captain Lynch...

1363
01:19:10,060 --> 01:19:11,229
- Captain Lynch... please!
- Captain Lynch?

1364
01:19:11,296 --> 01:19:13,097
Captain Lynch...

1365
01:19:13,163 --> 01:19:15,200
Hey, what is that?

1366
01:19:15,267 --> 01:19:16,535
That's the thing.
I don't know.

1367
01:19:18,068 --> 01:19:20,137
- I can't make out...
- Can't tell what it is...

1368
01:19:20,205 --> 01:19:23,107
How'd I do?

1369
01:19:23,173 --> 01:19:25,277
- Terrible.
- Terrible.

1370
01:19:25,343 --> 01:19:26,678
I'm ready to get
back in the water.

1371
01:19:26,745 --> 01:19:28,179
How's the tagging
and tracking going?

1372
01:19:28,246 --> 01:19:29,781
Hard to say.

1373
01:19:29,848 --> 01:19:31,516
Do you think they're mates?

1374
01:19:31,583 --> 01:19:32,751
Hard to say.

1375
01:19:32,817 --> 01:19:36,053
- Not till we go looking.
- Not until we go looking.

1376
01:19:36,120 --> 01:19:37,822
- Well...
- We won't know.

1377
01:19:37,889 --> 01:19:39,324
Let's go looking, gentlemen.

1378
01:19:39,391 --> 01:19:42,227
Is that your thing? Like
repeating everything I say?

1379
01:19:42,294 --> 01:19:43,562
- Oh, my goodness...
- I'm not trying...

1380
01:19:43,628 --> 01:19:44,429
Let's go!

1381
01:19:44,496 --> 01:19:46,565
It just that it seems like I am.
