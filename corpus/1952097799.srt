1
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:30,415
Where are we?

2
00:02:30,416 --> 00:02:31,817
I don't know

3
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:33,452
Can't see anything.

4
00:02:33,453 --> 00:02:36,188
Radio doesn't either work.

5
00:02:36,189 --> 00:02:38,824
I said it looks familiar but, I...

6
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:41,825
I never been inside the cloud before.

7
00:02:42,061 --> 00:02:44,263
What's the last sight you saw?

8
00:02:44,264 --> 00:02:45,964
Same was what I didn't see it.

9
00:02:45,965 --> 00:02:48,965
Spend like this all night,
as long freaking fog vague in history.

10
00:02:50,203 --> 00:02:52,604
It's kinda that long

11
00:02:52,605 --> 00:02:55,605
Moving past than we are...
what are you doing like? Two?

12
00:02:57,443 --> 00:03:00,443
You know, I have listened to
you snored for like an hour.

13
00:03:00,613 --> 00:03:02,214
Now, you give me grieve.
You wanna drive?

14
00:03:02,215 --> 00:03:05,215
No, no, no...

15
00:03:05,418 --> 00:03:06,818
Believe me,
if there'd a crippled old lady

16
00:03:06,819 --> 00:03:09,254
passed in
her son's handicapped scooter,

17
00:03:09,255 --> 00:03:12,255
when you ride with her...
I bet she must go faster than us.

18
00:03:16,429 --> 00:03:19,164
Jesus Christ!!!!

19
00:03:19,165 --> 00:03:20,699
Shit!

20
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:21,934
Holy shit!

21
00:03:21,935 --> 00:03:23,869
That is not a way the fog to leave.

22
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:26,870
He couId kill somebody.

23
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:32,411
I think we are up on the sidewalk.

24
00:03:32,412 --> 00:03:35,412
Oh, man.

25
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:39,384
Oh, crap.

26
00:03:39,385 --> 00:03:42,385
You get out, give it some push.

27
00:03:43,256 --> 00:03:45,190
I can't see anything.

28
00:03:45,191 --> 00:03:47,726
WeIcome to my world.

29
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:49,261
There is somebody out there.

30
00:03:49,262 --> 00:03:51,496
Then ask direction. Jesus Christ!

31
00:03:51,497 --> 00:03:53,732
Gibbs, you're like a little girl.
C'mon!

32
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:56,733
You're like a girl

33
00:03:58,671 --> 00:04:01,671
God damn it.

34
00:04:03,176 --> 00:04:06,176
Push.

35
00:04:07,647 --> 00:04:08,614
Push.

36
00:04:08,615 --> 00:04:11,615
Ok! Try to get the other way!

37
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:30,700
Excuse me. Excuse me! Excuse me! Hey!

38
00:04:34,974 --> 00:04:37,974
That was fucked up!

39
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:41,079
Hooke, what are you doing?

40
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:44,080
They are going somewhere.
I wanna find out where we are.

41
00:04:44,517 --> 00:04:47,517
Wait, Hold up! You know what,
I will grab the bags. Hooke!

42
00:04:52,692 --> 00:04:55,692
Hey, you ever see the movie while
pirates traveling around in the fog?

43
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:57,963
Can't believe you watch that crap.

44
00:04:57,964 --> 00:04:59,965
It was the mother fucked protect you up!

45
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:01,667
It is shit.

46
00:05:01,668 --> 00:05:03,468
There're zombies with swords!

47
00:05:03,469 --> 00:05:06,469
They jump out the fog
and they stab on your face and they...

48
00:05:06,773 --> 00:05:09,241
And the parrot goes through your eyes,

49
00:05:09,242 --> 00:05:11,777
and is like David Jones'
lock in the puzzle.

50
00:05:11,778 --> 00:05:14,446
Oh! It's amazing.

51
00:05:14,447 --> 00:05:17,447
It's like cinema. You know,
just moves you. God, it's great!

52
00:05:19,719 --> 00:05:21,953
That's your education really paid off.

53
00:05:21,954 --> 00:05:23,922
Your parent muse be
very proud of you. Gibbs.

54
00:05:23,923 --> 00:05:25,023
It's really good movie.

55
00:05:25,024 --> 00:05:26,291
Sure.

56
00:05:26,292 --> 00:05:27,392
Zombies with swords.

57
00:05:27,393 --> 00:05:30,393
Ten for it.

58
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,501
What do you think?

59
00:05:36,502 --> 00:05:38,804
I don't know.
Something doesn't feeI right.

60
00:05:38,805 --> 00:05:40,138
But I don't think we have a choice.

61
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:43,139
Well you know, beast wouId shit out
and wander around in the fog.

62
00:05:46,446 --> 00:05:49,446
All right, let's give it a shot!

63
00:05:49,449 --> 00:05:50,849
We were crashed to the far clears!

64
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:53,819
I don't think we couId
find a wine and the soup.

65
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:56,820
But if it's a hot little maid,
Gibbs calls dips.

66
00:06:08,735 --> 00:06:11,735
Yeah! Ok, this is uh...
I don't really know what it is.

67
00:06:15,908 --> 00:06:17,843
Just glad I'm not an animal.

68
00:06:17,844 --> 00:06:20,844
What the hell is this place!

69
00:06:20,847 --> 00:06:23,847
Mercy.

70
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:28,487
This town.

71
00:06:28,488 --> 00:06:31,488
Mercy.

72
00:06:31,758 --> 00:06:34,259
Well, we didn't see any sign so...

73
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:37,260
We...have a game tomorrow,
we're playing a festival.

74
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:40,298
Yap, if we couId get out of this fog.

75
00:06:40,299 --> 00:06:43,299
Oh, yeah! The fog.

76
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:48,405
I take the chance.

77
00:06:50,843 --> 00:06:52,978
FeeIs one room for the night.

78
00:06:52,979 --> 00:06:55,979
Rooms. Rooms if you have any.

79
00:06:56,682 --> 00:06:59,317
Sure. We just happened to
have couple of rooms.

80
00:06:59,318 --> 00:07:00,519
Ya, it's a shock.

81
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:03,520
If you sign the book.

82
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:10,660
Here you go. Boys! Eleven, tweIve.

83
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:14,931
Excuse me.
I need you both to sign the book.

84
00:07:18,905 --> 00:07:21,473
Okay.

85
00:07:21,474 --> 00:07:23,275
Let me give you a credit card for this.

86
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:26,276
That's all right.
We will take care that charge later.

87
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:30,180
Okay

88
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:33,950
Uh, is it too late to get something eat?

89
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:37,420
Yeah.

90
00:07:39,192 --> 00:07:42,192
Sorry.

91
00:07:42,528 --> 00:07:45,528
I wasn't hungry anyway.

92
00:07:53,339 --> 00:07:56,339
Hey, that fucker looks like in the fog.

93
00:08:06,352 --> 00:08:08,687
It's gotta cute.

94
00:08:08,688 --> 00:08:11,688
Let's go, brother.

95
00:08:16,762 --> 00:08:19,762
Yap, your eleven.

96
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:23,333
Hooke.

97
00:08:25,838 --> 00:08:28,838
Ok. We need it some locked.

98
00:08:43,956 --> 00:08:45,323
Man. You are pathetic.

99
00:08:45,324 --> 00:08:48,324
What! It's wide open.
Anybody couId be hidding in here.

100
00:08:48,961 --> 00:08:51,961
Gibbs, you get a room with a view.

101
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:56,866
Sweet.

102
00:08:58,170 --> 00:09:01,170
Maybe you couId call out
for that hot little maid.

103
00:09:02,508 --> 00:09:03,742
Hey, Hooke.

104
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:05,710
You want me to go with you?

105
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:07,112
Check your room out.

106
00:09:07,113 --> 00:09:10,113
If I see anything spooky, I'll scream.

107
00:09:11,684 --> 00:09:14,286
It's night light there, if you need it.

108
00:09:14,287 --> 00:09:17,287
Good night, buddy.

109
00:09:28,134 --> 00:09:31,134
Sure, you got that secured room.

110
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:39,344
It's very funny, man.

111
00:09:39,345 --> 00:09:41,646
Really mature.

112
00:09:41,647 --> 00:09:44,647
That's classic.

113
00:10:23,389 --> 00:10:26,389
Do I know you?

114
00:10:28,694 --> 00:10:31,694
Remember me.
I know you?

115
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:47,746
What?

116
00:10:47,747 --> 00:10:50,747
It's me. You told me
to wake you up at six am.

117
00:10:51,851 --> 00:10:54,851
Hold on.

118
00:11:01,227 --> 00:11:02,961
Good morning.

119
00:11:02,962 --> 00:11:05,962
Morning

120
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:09,165
Look like you are in the fog.
I got it 'cause...

121
00:11:11,237 --> 00:11:13,238
I just had a crazy dream, Man.

122
00:11:13,239 --> 00:11:16,239
You know, the fog bullshit is back,
so I'm not going anywhere with that.

123
00:11:17,777 --> 00:11:20,777
Well, it will be like soon so...

124
00:11:22,882 --> 00:11:25,882
Let's go. Let's burn off.

125
00:11:26,385 --> 00:11:29,385
Whatever.

126
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:33,958
You know, why don't we...

127
00:11:33,959 --> 00:11:36,959
uh get a bit to eat
before you get it lost again.

128
00:11:37,196 --> 00:11:39,364
No, no way. I don't want to be late.

129
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:40,799
C'mon.

130
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,800
All that costs to the room.

131
00:11:46,739 --> 00:11:47,839
All right.

132
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:50,840
Let's go. Make it quick, all right.

133
00:12:02,922 --> 00:12:05,922
This room can use that
miracle home makeover, dude.

134
00:12:06,992 --> 00:12:09,992
Gibbs, check it out.

135
00:12:10,196 --> 00:12:10,862
Nice.

136
00:12:10,863 --> 00:12:12,797
They haven't used it in years.

137
00:12:12,798 --> 00:12:15,798
Maybe they shouId, get little cold.

138
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:25,777
I guess we sit.

139
00:12:25,778 --> 00:12:28,778
That was not set.

140
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:43,860
That was weird.
A little weird.

141
00:13:21,867 --> 00:13:24,402
What's up the kids
cleaning this dinning room.

142
00:13:24,403 --> 00:13:27,403
You don't want to have
whatever tasted dusty for the breakfast.

143
00:13:27,673 --> 00:13:30,208
Dinner.

144
00:13:30,209 --> 00:13:32,911
You said breakfast.

145
00:13:32,912 --> 00:13:35,747
Yeah, that's sort of way me
and my friend like to do it.

146
00:13:35,748 --> 00:13:38,550
We like it save dinner
till the end of the day.

147
00:13:38,551 --> 00:13:40,151
It is the end.

148
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:40,952
What!

149
00:13:40,953 --> 00:13:43,953
It's six fifteen, in the evening.

150
00:13:45,591 --> 00:13:46,958
There is no way.

151
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:49,060
We..we just checked in last night.

152
00:13:49,061 --> 00:13:50,628
That must be late last night.

153
00:13:50,629 --> 00:13:52,497
Or early in the morning?

154
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:53,998
No, no, no, no...

155
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:56,501
There is no way
we slept for twenty four hours.

156
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:58,136
Man, we miss our geek!

157
00:13:58,137 --> 00:14:01,137
He must need it a rest.
I'm Peter Rose. This is my wife, Diane.

158
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:05,577
Mike Gibbs.

159
00:14:05,578 --> 00:14:06,811
John Hooke.

160
00:14:06,812 --> 00:14:09,614
Hey...There's a Hook
in the Ohio. H-o-o-k

161
00:14:09,615 --> 00:14:10,481
Na, I don't think so.

162
00:14:10,482 --> 00:14:13,482
That's an E
in the end of mine, H-o-o-k-e.

163
00:14:15,721 --> 00:14:18,721
Hey, let's get out here.
Let's grasp some to eat on the road.

164
00:14:19,491 --> 00:14:20,725
What's the rush?

165
00:14:20,726 --> 00:14:23,726
We already blow it.
We might as well stay for a dinner.

166
00:14:24,263 --> 00:14:27,263
That's some fog out there, huh?

167
00:14:27,633 --> 00:14:29,767
I like the fog.

168
00:14:29,768 --> 00:14:32,768
Just looks like it's day
down at any time soon neither.

169
00:14:33,172 --> 00:14:36,172
But, we don't mind.

170
00:14:38,077 --> 00:14:40,912
Our first vacation in the years.

171
00:14:40,913 --> 00:14:43,913
My boss just has to get by
without me for a day or two.

172
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:47,049
That's ok with me.

173
00:14:47,353 --> 00:14:49,420
She reminds me of somebody.

174
00:14:49,421 --> 00:14:50,588
Whatever.

175
00:14:50,589 --> 00:14:52,490
So, how about you?

176
00:14:52,491 --> 00:14:55,491
You here on business or pleasure, huh?

177
00:14:55,628 --> 00:14:57,528
I'm just passing through.

178
00:14:57,529 --> 00:14:59,297
Oh... really?

179
00:14:59,298 --> 00:15:02,298
And for us.
We got here this afternoon, I guess.

180
00:15:03,802 --> 00:15:06,802
Oh, thank goodness we found this place.
It's crazy out there.

181
00:15:06,939 --> 00:15:09,173
CouIdn't see a damn thing in the fog!

182
00:15:09,174 --> 00:15:12,174
Haha...Yeah, too bad.

183
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:16,746
Good evening, everyone.

184
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:20,650
I think Benedict cooked himseIf tonight.

185
00:15:21,654 --> 00:15:23,154
This looks so delicious.

186
00:15:23,155 --> 00:15:26,155
Oh yeah.

187
00:15:26,625 --> 00:15:29,625
I have got the wine.

188
00:15:31,163 --> 00:15:32,764
Wine.

189
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:35,765
Fill it up on top, Mark.
He is such cheap with wine.

190
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:40,004
I haven't had brusseIs sprouts in years.

191
00:15:40,005 --> 00:15:42,073
He loves brusseIs sprouts.

192
00:15:42,074 --> 00:15:44,642
Don't we all?

193
00:15:44,643 --> 00:15:47,643
Excuse me, is there anyway
I can take a look at menu?

194
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:57,954
Sorry, we are working on it,
but tonight this is the menu.

195
00:15:58,891 --> 00:16:00,758
Great. Thanks.

196
00:16:00,759 --> 00:16:03,759
Well, enjoy your dinner.

197
00:16:09,535 --> 00:16:10,601
What's wrong?

198
00:16:10,602 --> 00:16:13,004
I don't like raw meat.

199
00:16:13,005 --> 00:16:15,540
Mean I can eat this?

200
00:16:15,541 --> 00:16:18,541
All right.

201
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:31,520
Is there anybody know there is
a coffee shop around here or anywhere?

202
00:16:33,425 --> 00:16:36,425
Is it the best food
that you've ever eaten in your life?

203
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:54,110
My God! I'm stuffed.

204
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:56,614
Can I get a coffee, please?

205
00:16:56,615 --> 00:16:58,816
Coffee?

206
00:16:58,817 --> 00:17:01,652
You don't want to
have a coffee after all that food.

207
00:17:01,653 --> 00:17:02,286
Actually, I...

208
00:17:02,287 --> 00:17:05,287
We don't have coffee!

209
00:17:13,065 --> 00:17:15,967
Looks like they lick the plates clean.

210
00:17:15,968 --> 00:17:18,968
As usual.

211
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:23,408
I'm so bored.

212
00:17:23,409 --> 00:17:26,010
I know, baby.

213
00:17:26,011 --> 00:17:29,011
He asked for coffee.

214
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:38,389
If we are stuck here for one night?

215
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:40,458
Fucked that! Let's go.

216
00:17:40,459 --> 00:17:41,926
What about the fog?

217
00:17:41,927 --> 00:17:44,927
I will give it a shit!
We'll find a way out of here. Let's go!

218
00:17:46,532 --> 00:17:49,532
Listen, when you get back to the city,
you shouId ...shouId call me, okay?

219
00:17:50,369 --> 00:17:53,369
21349555..you can emaiI me, totally!

220
00:18:02,014 --> 00:18:03,448
What about the bill?

221
00:18:03,449 --> 00:18:06,449
We send him a check.

222
00:18:07,319 --> 00:18:10,319
Did I give you the keys?

223
00:18:10,856 --> 00:18:13,856
Shit!

224
00:18:16,795 --> 00:18:19,664
Here we go! Here we go!

225
00:18:19,665 --> 00:18:22,366
Keys! keys!

226
00:18:22,367 --> 00:18:24,902
Gibbs, you don't have them?

227
00:18:24,903 --> 00:18:26,437
Gibbs, you don't have them?

228
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:29,240
No! You were driving!

229
00:18:29,241 --> 00:18:31,109
I must have left them in the car.

230
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:33,044
All right, I am gonna look.

231
00:18:33,045 --> 00:18:36,045
Okay. Keep me informed.

232
00:19:25,364 --> 00:19:28,364
shit!

233
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:43,012
He asked for coffee.
Why did he ask for a coffee?

234
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:46,184
Did he eat his meal?

235
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:48,085
Every bit.

236
00:19:48,086 --> 00:19:50,021
And he drank the wine.

237
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:51,856
Not a drop left.

238
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:53,558
Don't worry.

239
00:19:53,559 --> 00:19:56,559
Are all your arranges made tonight?

240
00:19:57,529 --> 00:20:00,529
Yes, like always.

241
00:20:01,233 --> 00:20:04,233
You can screw up, I'm not, okay?

242
00:20:09,841 --> 00:20:12,841
C'mon. You know how he gets.

243
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:18,380
You have a second thought.

244
00:20:19,084 --> 00:20:22,084
You know what you wouId
get into, my killer on board.

245
00:20:23,021 --> 00:20:24,388
We can't leave here untiI...

246
00:20:24,389 --> 00:20:27,389
I know! But what if it doesn't happen?

247
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:31,894
She is right. We couId die here.

248
00:20:32,130 --> 00:20:35,130
That's enough. We're so close.

249
00:20:36,535 --> 00:20:39,503
OnIy weeks away,
we get stronger everyday.

250
00:20:39,504 --> 00:20:42,504
We will succeed. We must.

251
00:20:45,777 --> 00:20:48,777
I need more ashes.

252
00:20:49,114 --> 00:20:50,881
Let's take care of it.

253
00:20:50,882 --> 00:20:53,651
You know,

254
00:20:53,652 --> 00:20:55,319
He is with you.

255
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:58,320
I'm with you, father.

256
00:20:59,391 --> 00:21:02,391
Yeah.

257
00:21:36,261 --> 00:21:39,030
The baby needs to eat.

258
00:21:39,031 --> 00:21:41,866
You know what we wouId do
to you for the sake of the baby.

259
00:21:41,867 --> 00:21:43,968
Why make yourseIf miserable?

260
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:46,969
Eat!

261
00:22:10,028 --> 00:22:11,896
Wait.

262
00:22:11,897 --> 00:22:12,997
You find some coffee?

263
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:14,799
Hey listen, did you eat tonight?

264
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:15,633
No.

265
00:22:15,634 --> 00:22:16,434
Good.

266
00:22:16,435 --> 00:22:19,435
Remember if you ever want to
get out of this place, no meat, no wine!

267
00:22:30,415 --> 00:22:33,415
Hey! Sleeping beauty.

268
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:39,188
Now, where you go?

269
00:22:41,693 --> 00:22:44,693
Gibbs! Gibbs!

270
00:22:53,238 --> 00:22:56,238
Gibbs!

271
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:14,590
Did you hear something?

272
00:24:14,219 --> 00:24:15,853
You are in Iuck.

273
00:24:15,854 --> 00:24:18,522
We do have one room available.

274
00:24:18,523 --> 00:24:20,624
That's great, I guess.

275
00:24:20,625 --> 00:24:23,625
We just have to find
a place for the night, honeymoon.

276
00:24:24,696 --> 00:24:26,530
Oh, yeah. I'm so glad
that Sharon picked you up.

277
00:24:26,531 --> 00:24:28,799
You know, we love honeymoon this year.

278
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:31,202
How often have you
been stuck in this fog?

279
00:24:31,203 --> 00:24:32,770
Lots of firsts, if you know what I mean.

280
00:24:32,771 --> 00:24:33,604
Scott!

281
00:24:33,605 --> 00:24:35,372
What!

282
00:24:35,373 --> 00:24:38,373
If you just sign the book.
I need you both to sign.

283
00:24:52,090 --> 00:24:54,558
Here you go.

284
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:55,960
Thanks.

285
00:24:55,961 --> 00:24:57,962
Let's go, honey. I'm cold.

286
00:24:57,963 --> 00:25:00,963
Well, you both get warmed up there.

287
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:10,441
I don't like this place.

288
00:25:10,442 --> 00:25:13,442
Uh, it's onIy for one night.

289
00:25:31,296 --> 00:25:33,330
Some honeymoon.

290
00:25:33,331 --> 00:25:36,331
You know what they said,
lousy honeymoon,

291
00:25:36,568 --> 00:25:38,669
Great memory.

292
00:25:38,670 --> 00:25:41,670
Is that what they said?

293
00:26:01,393 --> 00:26:04,393
It's the good thing they came tonight.

294
00:26:12,437 --> 00:26:15,437
We couId have taken one of the others.

295
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:18,640
Spend all these time
buiIding in the Mamati ash.

296
00:26:19,711 --> 00:26:22,711
You know what I need yet?

297
00:26:23,648 --> 00:26:26,648
In his seek it's just weak.

298
00:26:39,831 --> 00:26:42,733
I've never slept
with a married woman before.

299
00:26:42,734 --> 00:26:45,734
Me neither.

300
00:26:46,605 --> 00:26:47,905
You know what I mean?

301
00:26:47,906 --> 00:26:50,906
Yeah.

302
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:56,614
What's that?

303
00:26:56,615 --> 00:26:59,615
I don't know.

304
00:27:12,297 --> 00:27:14,632
Oh, man. This is too weird!

305
00:27:14,633 --> 00:27:15,966
What's going on?

306
00:27:15,967 --> 00:27:18,967
I have no idea.

307
00:27:19,037 --> 00:27:22,037
Maybe we shouId complain.

308
00:27:22,073 --> 00:27:23,774
What are you doing?

309
00:27:23,775 --> 00:27:24,808
This is nuts!

310
00:27:24,809 --> 00:27:27,809
I will take care of it.

311
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:32,481
Don't answer, for the Christ's sakes.

312
00:27:34,252 --> 00:27:37,252
Go away!

313
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:45,060
Wow! Baby. Well done.

314
00:27:45,063 --> 00:27:46,530
I wanna go! I wanna go right now!

315
00:27:46,531 --> 00:27:49,531
Okay. Okay. Okay. I will get my stuff.

316
00:29:32,003 --> 00:29:33,203
Jesus Christ, man!

317
00:29:33,204 --> 00:29:34,938
What the fucked is up with you?

318
00:29:34,939 --> 00:29:37,307
What the hell have you been?

319
00:29:37,308 --> 00:29:38,842
Looking for you.

320
00:29:38,843 --> 00:29:39,877
We gotta go now.

321
00:29:39,878 --> 00:29:40,878
Oh, you found keys?

322
00:29:40,879 --> 00:29:42,946
I found a car, we gonna hot wired.

323
00:29:42,947 --> 00:29:45,947

00:30:17,182 --> 00:30:20,182
Roy, heIp me.

326
00:30:36,634 --> 00:30:39,634
No...

327
00:31:50,308 --> 00:31:51,942
Where are we?

328
00:31:51,943 --> 00:31:53,744
I don't know.

329
00:31:53,745 --> 00:31:56,246
I say it looks familiar, but I...

330
00:31:56,247 --> 00:31:59,247
I never been inside the cloud before.

331
00:32:01,653 --> 00:32:04,288
Now I got ever heard that one.

332
00:32:04,289 --> 00:32:07,289
That's okay.
This is right for that place.

333
00:32:07,458 --> 00:32:08,659
Whatever.

334
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:10,394
What are we doing? Like two?

335
00:32:10,395 --> 00:32:12,129
Hey, broke the record! You wanna drive?

336
00:32:12,130 --> 00:32:14,631
No, no, no, no.

337
00:32:14,632 --> 00:32:15,532
What if a crippled old ladies

338
00:32:15,533 --> 00:32:17,334
passed in
her son's handicapped scooter,

339
00:32:17,335 --> 00:32:18,535
you let me know.

340
00:32:18,536 --> 00:32:21,536
I will ride with her.
She couId go faster than us.

341
00:32:23,875 --> 00:32:26,510
Jesus. What the fuck!

342
00:32:26,511 --> 00:32:29,511
Shit!

343
00:32:32,884 --> 00:32:35,485
Fuck!

344
00:32:35,486 --> 00:32:38,486
Gibbs, we are not going anywhere.

345
00:32:54,472 --> 00:32:57,472
What do you think?

346
00:32:58,476 --> 00:33:00,243
I don't believe this.

347
00:33:00,244 --> 00:33:03,244
Beast wouId shit out
and wander around in the fog.

348
00:33:05,049 --> 00:33:07,584
We gotta get a phone.

349
00:33:07,585 --> 00:33:10,585
All right, if there is
a hot little maid, Gibbs calls dips!

350
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:17,594
Yeah. Ok!

351
00:33:17,595 --> 00:33:20,364
This is uh...

352
00:33:20,365 --> 00:33:23,166
I don't really know what this is.

353
00:33:23,167 --> 00:33:26,167
Glad I'm not an animal.

354
00:33:26,237 --> 00:33:29,006
WeIcome to Mercy.

355
00:33:29,007 --> 00:33:30,374
Sir!

356
00:33:30,375 --> 00:33:33,010
Sir, we really need a car,
a tow truck, ok?

357
00:33:33,011 --> 00:33:34,144
Well, the phone line is been down.

358
00:33:34,145 --> 00:33:37,145
Suggested, maybe they
will be working tomorrow.

359
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:40,183
I guess you want a room.

360
00:33:40,184 --> 00:33:43,184
If you just sign the book.

361
00:33:47,658 --> 00:33:48,725

00:33:51,462 --> 00:33:54,462
Appreciate if you both sign.

364
00:33:56,634 --> 00:33:59,634
Hey guys, we get a nice home
cooked breakfast in the dinning hall.

365
00:34:01,539 --> 00:34:03,707
Can't miss it.
Straight around the back.

366
00:34:03,708 --> 00:34:06,243
Yeah. We know where it is.

367
00:34:06,244 --> 00:34:09,244
At least we didn't miss
the breakfast before the bed.

368
00:34:26,464 --> 00:34:28,432
Good morning.

369
00:34:28,433 --> 00:34:31,368
We get out of here. Fog, there's no fog.

370
00:34:31,369 --> 00:34:33,103
You know what?
Let's eat breakfast first.

371
00:34:33,104 --> 00:34:36,104
Then we worry about
getting out of here part.

372
00:34:36,941 --> 00:34:39,076
Dinner.

373
00:34:39,077 --> 00:34:40,377
Excuse me.

374
00:34:40,378 --> 00:34:42,012
You said breakfast.

375
00:34:42,013 --> 00:34:43,380
Yeah. That's..

376
00:34:43,381 --> 00:34:45,048
that's sort of way me
and my friend like to do it.

377
00:34:45,049 --> 00:34:48,049
We like to save dinner
till the end of a day.

378
00:34:48,352 --> 00:34:49,820
It is the end.

379
00:34:49,821 --> 00:34:51,488
I told you.

380
00:34:51,489 --> 00:34:54,024
It's six fifteen.

381
00:34:54,025 --> 00:34:56,493
In the evening.

382
00:34:56,494 --> 00:34:58,762
It's so weird.

383
00:34:58,763 --> 00:35:01,565
We couIdn't dream all day.

384
00:35:01,566 --> 00:35:04,334
That's what I'm trying to tell you.

385
00:35:04,335 --> 00:35:05,869
Man, we miss our geek.

386
00:35:05,870 --> 00:35:07,170
Yes, we miss our geek.

387
00:35:07,171 --> 00:35:08,939
It was yesterday.

388
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:11,940
I'm Peter Rose. It's my wife, Diane.

389
00:35:13,177 --> 00:35:15,946
Mike Gibbs.

390
00:35:15,947 --> 00:35:18,947
And this is my friend. John Hooke.

391
00:35:19,350 --> 00:35:21,384
Wow! Any Russian Hook from Ohio?

392
00:35:21,385 --> 00:35:23,353
No, there's not.
You already asked me that.

393
00:35:23,354 --> 00:35:24,688
Remember? Last night.

394
00:35:24,689 --> 00:35:27,689
I have an E in the end of mine.
You remember that?

395
00:35:28,326 --> 00:35:31,326
Jesus! This is insane. Let's go, man.

396
00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:33,363
What's the rush?

397
00:35:33,364 --> 00:35:35,332
I suppose to stay for the dinner.

398
00:35:35,333 --> 00:35:38,333
There are some fogs out there, uh?

399
00:35:38,402 --> 00:35:39,970
I like the fog.

400
00:35:39,971 --> 00:35:42,873
Roy, where did two of you last night?

401
00:35:42,874 --> 00:35:43,974
No, just me.

402
00:35:43,975 --> 00:35:46,975
That looks like
settle down anytime either.

403
00:35:47,578 --> 00:35:50,578
But... we don't mind.

404
00:35:51,516 --> 00:35:52,616
Let me guess.

405
00:35:52,617 --> 00:35:55,617
First vacation in years, right?

406
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:57,387
How did you know?

407
00:35:57,388 --> 00:36:00,388
And your boss he can't get by it,
another day or two without you.

408
00:36:03,294 --> 00:36:05,395
I was just going to say that.

409
00:36:05,396 --> 00:36:08,396
I never ....So, how about you?

410
00:36:08,399 --> 00:36:09,866
What brings you here?

411
00:36:09,867 --> 00:36:12,802
Business or pleasure?

412
00:36:12,803 --> 00:36:15,138
I'm just passing through.

413
00:36:15,139 --> 00:36:16,940
Same with us.

414
00:36:16,941 --> 00:36:18,975
We just got here last night.

415
00:36:18,976 --> 00:36:21,344
Wait, where is the Mrs?

416
00:36:21,345 --> 00:36:23,980
You don't remember, uh?

417
00:36:23,981 --> 00:36:26,616
You can't see anything
in this damned fog, right?

418
00:36:26,617 --> 00:36:29,617
That's exactIy what I just about to say.

419
00:36:29,654 --> 00:36:31,254
That's amazing.

420
00:36:31,255 --> 00:36:33,390
It's a bit weird.

421
00:36:33,391 --> 00:36:36,391
You're something.

422
00:36:36,527 --> 00:36:39,527
Good evening, everyone.

423
00:36:39,931 --> 00:36:42,931
I think Benedict cooked himseIf tonight.

424
00:36:43,267 --> 00:36:46,267
I got the wine.

425
00:36:46,404 --> 00:36:47,437
Well.

426
00:36:47,438 --> 00:36:50,438
Enjoy your dinner.

427
00:36:52,276 --> 00:36:55,276
Let's begin.

428
00:36:57,582 --> 00:37:00,383
Where is he? Where is Scott?

429
00:37:00,384 --> 00:37:01,718
Scott?

430
00:37:01,719 --> 00:37:02,953
It's my husband.

431
00:37:02,954 --> 00:37:05,954
We went to our room
and with all this chanting.

432
00:37:07,858 --> 00:37:10,360
I know something terrible was happened.

433
00:37:10,361 --> 00:37:12,529
You shouId sit down
and have some dinner.

434
00:37:12,530 --> 00:37:14,664
I'm not hungry.

435
00:37:14,665 --> 00:37:17,665
Have some wine, sweety.
It will calm your nerves.

436
00:37:19,136 --> 00:37:22,136
Don't, no. Don't...

437
00:37:44,295 --> 00:37:47,295
I think I'm hungry after all.

438
00:37:53,137 --> 00:37:55,905
What about Scott?

439
00:37:55,906 --> 00:37:57,307
Who?

440
00:37:57,308 --> 00:37:58,775
I haven't had a brusseIs sprouts...

441
00:37:58,776 --> 00:38:00,410
In years?

442
00:38:00,411 --> 00:38:02,012
Years, right?

443
00:38:02,013 --> 00:38:04,848
And your husband he
loves brusseIs sprouts, doesn't he?

444
00:38:04,849 --> 00:38:07,751
Yeah. He does love brusseIs sprouts.

445
00:38:07,752 --> 00:38:09,653
Don't you people remember?

446
00:38:09,654 --> 00:38:12,455
You don't remember
the introduction and small talk,

447
00:38:12,456 --> 00:38:14,824
the roast beef, the fucking sprouts?

448
00:38:14,825 --> 00:38:16,326
You don't remember?

449
00:38:16,327 --> 00:38:18,295
We did this
exactIy same thing last night.

450
00:38:18,296 --> 00:38:19,729
You guys don't remember?

451
00:38:19,730 --> 00:38:21,965
Roy! Where is your wife?

452
00:38:21,966 --> 00:38:23,867
Susan!

453
00:38:23,868 --> 00:38:25,068
She is right there.

454
00:38:25,069 --> 00:38:26,936
That's not his wife! For Christ's sakes!

455
00:38:26,937 --> 00:38:27,971
You don't remember?

456
00:38:27,972 --> 00:38:30,972
How couId you not remember?

457
00:38:31,208 --> 00:38:34,208
Jesus!

458
00:38:52,229 --> 00:38:53,163
Where is Ramon?

459
00:38:53,164 --> 00:38:55,765
He had to fetch more.
Sorry.

460
00:38:55,766 --> 00:38:57,634
Perhaps you forgot what's the stake.

461
00:38:57,635 --> 00:38:59,703
We need the trinity.

462
00:38:59,704 --> 00:39:02,704
I said I'm sorry.

463
00:39:12,316 --> 00:39:15,316
Bless the ash.

464
00:39:15,986 --> 00:39:18,986
Create the healthy chiId
and we all will be free.

465
00:39:19,990 --> 00:39:22,392
Create the chiId.

466
00:39:22,393 --> 00:39:24,894
Create the chiId.

467
00:39:24,895 --> 00:39:26,896
Create the chiId.

468
00:39:26,897 --> 00:39:29,897
Create the chiId.

469
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:30,640
Look at her.

470
00:43:30,641 --> 00:43:32,675
Another weak link,
just like the others.

471
00:43:32,676 --> 00:43:34,978
And choose to spit out
and not to use any longer fresh,

472
00:43:34,979 --> 00:43:36,813
if she does miss the carry first.

473
00:43:36,814 --> 00:43:38,481
Patience.

474
00:43:38,482 --> 00:43:41,217
That's we get stronger,
so do the babies.

475
00:43:41,218 --> 00:43:44,218
Well, not one of them
must fight for more than couple days.

476
00:43:44,888 --> 00:43:47,056
This page will be different.

477
00:43:47,057 --> 00:43:49,359
Look at this healthy chiId.

478
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:51,194
Before the ninth?

479
00:43:51,195 --> 00:43:54,195
We are running out the time.

480
00:43:54,264 --> 00:43:56,099
She is not cooperating.

481
00:43:56,100 --> 00:43:59,100
Some of them won't eat
meat or drink the wine.

482
00:43:59,136 --> 00:44:01,170
We can't risk taking the chiId.

483
00:44:01,171 --> 00:44:03,172
This one is very close.

484
00:44:03,173 --> 00:44:06,173
Then what? Another dead one for sharing?

485
00:44:06,310 --> 00:44:07,677
Or maybe this time we wouId be Iucky

486
00:44:07,678 --> 00:44:09,879
and we wouId onIy have
two arms and two legs.

487
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:11,948
You took this on.

488
00:44:11,949 --> 00:44:14,949
You made the choice years ago.

489
00:44:15,285 --> 00:44:18,285
You wouIdn't given us this job
if you didn't think we can do it.

490
00:44:20,357 --> 00:44:21,891
Of course.

491
00:44:21,892 --> 00:44:24,127
You're right.

492
00:44:24,128 --> 00:44:26,829
September ninth is so close.

493
00:44:26,830 --> 00:44:29,232
And finally
we can leave here for eternity.

494
00:44:29,233 --> 00:44:31,200
That's better.

495
00:44:31,201 --> 00:44:34,201
There're so much to look forward to.

496
00:44:34,271 --> 00:44:35,538
Please let me out.

497
00:44:35,539 --> 00:44:36,572
Please.

498
00:44:36,573 --> 00:44:38,541
You can't just keep me here forever.

499
00:44:38,542 --> 00:44:41,044
People will miss me.

500
00:44:41,045 --> 00:44:42,445
She's almost too.

501
00:44:42,446 --> 00:44:44,647
I can't wait to be doing with this.

502
00:44:44,648 --> 00:44:46,883
I won't tell anybody. I promise.

503
00:44:46,884 --> 00:44:49,884
I will give you anything.
Just please let me and my baby out.

504
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:52,922
Just becoming so tedious.

505
00:44:52,923 --> 00:44:55,591
Becoming!

506
00:44:55,592 --> 00:44:58,592
I've got some loveIy wine.
I just can't wait for her to try it.

507
00:45:00,698 --> 00:45:03,698
No, please don't go.
Please! Please!

508
00:45:07,771 --> 00:45:10,771
Shut up!

509
00:45:39,236 --> 00:45:41,804
How did you know that I just want you?

510
00:45:41,805 --> 00:45:44,805
All that chilling really gets you going.

511
00:45:46,276 --> 00:45:49,276
You want some more?

512
00:46:02,292 --> 00:46:05,292
I'm done.

513
00:46:05,729 --> 00:46:08,729
So you're checking out
the new starter over here?

514
00:46:08,932 --> 00:46:11,801
He was cute.

515
00:46:11,802 --> 00:46:14,437
Cute and tasty.

516
00:46:14,438 --> 00:46:17,438
Like a baby bird.

517
00:46:18,675 --> 00:46:21,675
You're jealous?

518
00:46:21,912 --> 00:46:23,880
Right.

519
00:46:23,881 --> 00:46:26,516
I'm jealous.

520
00:46:26,517 --> 00:46:29,452
Next time, he comes
and bring one of the other girls.

521
00:46:29,453 --> 00:46:32,453
I'm getting bored.

522
00:46:41,932 --> 00:46:44,932
Bored my ass.

523
00:46:56,046 --> 00:46:57,213
It's me.

524
00:46:57,214 --> 00:46:59,549
What the hell you think you're
doing out here in this town at night?

525
00:46:59,550 --> 00:47:00,917
You want to get yourseIf killed?

526
00:47:00,918 --> 00:47:02,351
We need to talk.

527
00:47:02,352 --> 00:47:05,352
Now.

528
00:47:12,996 --> 00:47:15,996
I see you're starting to remember.

529
00:47:17,868 --> 00:47:20,868
There is something about it.

530
00:47:27,978 --> 00:47:29,579
That's right, honey.

531
00:47:29,580 --> 00:47:32,580
You worked for that band.

532
00:47:35,986 --> 00:47:38,454
Jack!

533
00:47:38,455 --> 00:47:40,356
Good!

534
00:47:40,357 --> 00:47:43,357
The ash is running off.

535
00:47:44,428 --> 00:47:46,529
Ash?

536
00:47:46,530 --> 00:47:47,897
What are you talking about?

537
00:47:47,898 --> 00:47:49,432
Take it easy.

538
00:47:49,433 --> 00:47:51,200
You don't get something
from nothing around here.

539
00:47:51,201 --> 00:47:52,768
Tell me.

540
00:47:52,769 --> 00:47:54,937
You got promised to get me out of here.

541
00:47:54,938 --> 00:47:57,139
I promise.

542
00:47:57,140 --> 00:47:58,574
Then you tell me
what the hell is going on.

543
00:47:58,575 --> 00:48:00,343
What is this place?

544
00:48:00,344 --> 00:48:03,112
Benedict, Elizabeth and Armon,

545
00:48:03,113 --> 00:48:06,113
They are witches. They kill people.

546
00:48:07,484 --> 00:48:09,418
They killed your friend.

547
00:48:09,419 --> 00:48:10,319
Gibbs?

548
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:11,888
Not Gibbs.

549
00:48:11,889 --> 00:48:14,889
He has eating and drinking
and having great all times.

550
00:48:20,964 --> 00:48:21,964
I can't.

551
00:48:21,965 --> 00:48:23,833
Remember.

552
00:48:23,834 --> 00:48:26,834
I know.

553
00:48:29,373 --> 00:48:32,174
There was a man.

554
00:48:32,175 --> 00:48:35,175
Some man with the beard.

555
00:48:36,113 --> 00:48:37,647
Jack?

556
00:48:37,648 --> 00:48:40,049
He is dead.

557
00:48:40,050 --> 00:48:41,984
Jack is dead?

558
00:48:41,985 --> 00:48:43,886
They killed all the ones first.

559
00:48:43,887 --> 00:48:46,887
No stand with it now.

560
00:48:50,427 --> 00:48:51,761
What about the rest of us?

561
00:48:51,762 --> 00:48:53,663
Right now, that's not important.

562
00:48:53,664 --> 00:48:55,364
The important thing is to get out.

563
00:48:55,365 --> 00:48:56,966
I tried!

564
00:48:56,967 --> 00:48:59,268
I can't fucking leave here!

565
00:48:59,269 --> 00:49:01,203
I can't leave. Why can't I leave here?

566
00:49:01,204 --> 00:49:03,406
Because you signed the book.

567
00:49:03,407 --> 00:49:05,207
Once you signed the book, that's it.

568
00:49:05,208 --> 00:49:06,909
It's like you signed your life away.

569
00:49:06,910 --> 00:49:09,910
They want you eat and drink,
the ash just makes it easy.

570
00:49:11,815 --> 00:49:14,016
The ash is in the food and drink?

571
00:49:14,017 --> 00:49:17,017
It's like some kind of mind control.

572
00:49:17,387 --> 00:49:19,422
The ash just make you forget.

573
00:49:19,423 --> 00:49:22,423
But not me. Why?

574
00:49:22,826 --> 00:49:25,826
Because I made damn sure
your food is clean. That's why.

575
00:49:33,704 --> 00:49:36,704
When you saw this...

576
00:49:40,377 --> 00:49:42,345
Shit!

577
00:49:42,346 --> 00:49:43,779
He takes the drugs on us.

578
00:49:43,780 --> 00:49:45,114
The food and the wine.

579
00:49:45,115 --> 00:49:46,816
Thanks for my screw-up liver.

580
00:49:46,817 --> 00:49:48,017
No wine for Jacky boy.

581
00:49:48,018 --> 00:49:50,553
You have to make this
all kind sounds a little bit crazy?

582
00:49:50,554 --> 00:49:52,021
When do we get here?
When do we get here?

583
00:49:52,022 --> 00:49:52,989
According to you it's..

584
00:49:52,990 --> 00:49:54,490
No, when do you remember
getting here?

585
00:49:54,491 --> 00:49:55,458
Yesterday

586
00:49:55,459 --> 00:49:56,726
Okay, what's the day that date?

587
00:49:56,727 --> 00:49:58,594
It's Thursday.
October twenty-third.

588
00:49:58,595 --> 00:49:59,195
Thursday.

589
00:49:59,196 --> 00:50:01,497
I took this from the couple
that showed up yesterday.

590
00:50:01,498 --> 00:50:02,398
Whenever, whenever.

591
00:50:02,399 --> 00:50:05,399
Roy and Susan something or other?
October, right?

592
00:50:05,402 --> 00:50:07,169
Read the date.

593
00:50:07,170 --> 00:50:08,104
ApriI fourth.

594
00:50:08,105 --> 00:50:09,438
Two thousand nine.

595
00:50:09,439 --> 00:50:11,207
We have been here for six months?

596
00:50:11,208 --> 00:50:13,242
I think time is altered.

597
00:50:13,243 --> 00:50:16,243
Maybe a day here is a week
outside or a month. I don't know!

598
00:50:16,646 --> 00:50:18,748
How did you know we haven't
figured this out all before?

599
00:50:18,749 --> 00:50:20,916
We don't know.

600
00:50:20,917 --> 00:50:22,785
Well! That's just fucking great!

601
00:50:22,786 --> 00:50:25,786
That's great.

602
00:50:36,833 --> 00:50:39,833
We shouId remember now.

603
00:50:39,870 --> 00:50:41,604
Oh my god!

604
00:50:41,605 --> 00:50:43,139
How do we get out of here?

605
00:50:43,140 --> 00:50:46,108
That nasty old van,
you know Charon the driver?

606
00:50:46,109 --> 00:50:48,878
Don't even think about taking that van.

607
00:50:48,879 --> 00:50:51,113
Charon's the onIy one
can get to the portal.

608
00:50:51,114 --> 00:50:54,114
Even Benedict,
the others either cannot, untiI...

609
00:50:56,186 --> 00:50:58,921
UntiI when?

610
00:50:58,922 --> 00:51:00,356
That's enough.

611
00:51:00,357 --> 00:51:02,858
You just get back
like everyone eIse.

612
00:51:02,859 --> 00:51:05,859
Don't let on that your memory is
coming back or eIse we were both dead.

613
00:51:08,565 --> 00:51:11,565
Wait!

614
00:51:12,335 --> 00:51:15,335
How do I know I can trust you?

615
00:51:15,939 --> 00:51:18,939
I worship God.

616
00:52:49,032 --> 00:52:52,032
HeIp me.

617
00:53:01,811 --> 00:53:04,811
How did you find me?

618
00:53:05,849 --> 00:53:08,849
Do I know you?

619
00:53:15,425 --> 00:53:16,725
I will be back.

620
00:53:16,726 --> 00:53:19,726
I promise.

621
00:53:22,332 --> 00:53:25,332
No...

622
00:53:51,661 --> 00:53:53,128
Elizabeth wants to see you.

623
00:53:53,129 --> 00:53:54,663
Sure. Baby.

624
00:53:54,664 --> 00:53:57,664
Now!

625
00:53:59,636 --> 00:54:02,504
You better save some to me.

626
00:54:02,505 --> 00:54:05,505
I will think about it.

627
00:54:13,917 --> 00:54:16,917
Lucky you.

628
00:54:29,165 --> 00:54:32,165
Hooke.

629
00:54:41,278 --> 00:54:44,278
Please. Please no.

630
00:54:45,248 --> 00:54:48,248
The betrayal shouId be
divided in the penalty.

631
00:54:48,518 --> 00:54:50,519
I don't know what you mean.

632
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:53,520
We live to serve you.

633
00:54:58,028 --> 00:55:01,028
Please! Father.

634
00:55:01,264 --> 00:55:04,264
No...

635
00:55:21,384 --> 00:55:24,384
Gibbs! Gibbs! Open up.

636
00:55:25,488 --> 00:55:28,488
Good evening.

637
00:55:28,892 --> 00:55:31,892
Gibbs!

638
00:55:47,143 --> 00:55:50,143
There you are. Come!

639
00:55:50,780 --> 00:55:51,947
You're not gonna believe this.

640
00:55:51,948 --> 00:55:54,948
But we slept the entire day.
You know it's six pm.

641
00:55:56,986 --> 00:55:59,521
I know.

642
00:55:59,522 --> 00:56:00,856
What do you mean you know?

643
00:56:00,857 --> 00:56:02,991
I know it's fucking dark outside,
I know!

644
00:56:02,992 --> 00:56:04,693
He must got late last night

645
00:56:04,694 --> 00:56:06,495
Or really early in the morning.

646
00:56:06,496 --> 00:56:09,496
I have enough for this.
Anybody eIse hungry?

647
00:56:10,033 --> 00:56:13,033
Gibbs.

648
00:56:13,670 --> 00:56:15,904
Good evening, everyone.

649
00:56:15,905 --> 00:56:18,607
I think Benedict cooked himseIf tonight.

650
00:56:18,608 --> 00:56:20,242
I get the wine.

651
00:56:20,243 --> 00:56:23,243
Let's not keep our guests waiting.

652
00:56:23,847 --> 00:56:25,114
It's fog out there, right?

653
00:56:25,115 --> 00:56:26,882
Yeah, I bet it won't run off.

654
00:56:26,883 --> 00:56:29,284
I may take this bit soup
when I was driving in yesterday.

655
00:56:29,285 --> 00:56:32,285
Roy, he is sales man.
He knows his parts very well.

656
00:56:32,322 --> 00:56:35,322
This is Peter and Diane.

657
00:56:35,959 --> 00:56:38,327
This is Nora.

658
00:56:38,328 --> 00:56:40,863
Oh, this is my friend. John Hooke.

659
00:56:40,864 --> 00:56:43,864
Hook, there's a
Russian Hook from Ohio. H.o.o.k

660
00:56:44,200 --> 00:56:47,002
No, I don't think so.

661
00:56:47,003 --> 00:56:49,405
I can't believe this.

662
00:56:49,406 --> 00:56:52,406
I love brusseIs sprouts.
Really?

663
00:56:52,409 --> 00:56:55,409
This looks so delicious.

664
00:56:56,012 --> 00:56:59,012
You are not in a mood for meat tonight?

665
00:57:00,984 --> 00:57:02,484
No, I am.

666
00:57:02,485 --> 00:57:05,485
You're kidding me.
I love this, love this.

667
00:57:07,424 --> 00:57:09,024
Gorgeous.

668
00:57:09,025 --> 00:57:12,025
Well, enjoy everyone.

669
00:57:22,105 --> 00:57:23,238
You don't like it?

670
00:57:23,239 --> 00:57:25,207
I have it.

671
00:57:25,208 --> 00:57:26,175
Listen to me.

672
00:57:26,176 --> 00:57:29,176
You didn't believe me before.
You gotta believe me now.

673
00:57:29,512 --> 00:57:31,346
Jesus Christ! Stop!

674
00:57:31,347 --> 00:57:32,414
Cut it out. Man!

675
00:57:32,415 --> 00:57:33,282
Listen to me.

676
00:57:33,283 --> 00:57:34,349
It doesn't have to happen.

677
00:57:34,350 --> 00:57:35,150
We can get out of here.

678
00:57:35,151 --> 00:57:36,919
We've done this for hundreds of times!

679
00:57:36,920 --> 00:57:38,520
We gona...

680
00:57:38,521 --> 00:57:41,521
Gibbs! Jack. Don't you remeber...

681
00:57:42,525 --> 00:57:45,494
Gibbs! Jack. Don't you remeber...

682
00:57:45,495 --> 00:57:48,495
Gibbs! Jesus Christ!

683
00:57:48,932 --> 00:57:50,532
You gotta remember!

684
00:57:50,533 --> 00:57:52,134
Gibbs, you gotta come
with me now. Now!

685
00:57:52,135 --> 00:57:54,236
Now!

686
00:57:54,237 --> 00:57:57,237
Fuck!

687
00:58:53,363 --> 00:58:55,197
I will make this really easy for you.

688
00:58:55,198 --> 00:58:57,900
You give me the keys. You leave.

689
00:58:57,901 --> 00:59:00,702
You don't remember, do you?

690
00:59:00,703 --> 00:59:03,272
No, you don't remember.

691
00:59:03,273 --> 00:59:05,207
You will never leave here.

692
00:59:05,208 --> 00:59:08,110
No one wouId make me pass the portal.

693
00:59:08,111 --> 00:59:09,711
Why is that?

694
00:59:09,712 --> 00:59:11,713
It's magic. Baby.

695
00:59:11,714 --> 00:59:14,714
No one but me can leave Mercy.

696
00:59:14,984 --> 00:59:16,184
Not untiI...

697
00:59:16,185 --> 00:59:18,487
Untill... till to when?

698
00:59:18,488 --> 00:59:21,488
UntiI the chiId was born.

699
00:59:23,927 --> 00:59:26,161
Those cages!

700
00:59:26,162 --> 00:59:27,296
Those women!

701
00:59:27,297 --> 00:59:29,398
Those women are breeding!

702
00:59:29,399 --> 00:59:32,399
The babies were born
and dead wouId be done.

703
00:59:33,202 --> 00:59:34,703
You rapped them!

704
00:59:34,704 --> 00:59:37,704
Not me! That will be your job.

705
01:00:02,832 --> 01:00:04,499
Oh my god.

706
01:00:04,500 --> 01:00:06,902
Oh my god.

707
01:00:06,903 --> 01:00:09,371
What have I done?

708
01:00:09,372 --> 01:00:12,372
What did you do to them?

709
01:00:14,577 --> 01:00:17,577
You wouId never leave here alive.

710
01:00:18,815 --> 01:00:21,815
Not you. Not your friends.
Not your girlfriend.

711
01:00:25,221 --> 01:00:28,221
What girlfriend!

712
01:00:28,224 --> 01:00:29,257
You can't remember?

713
01:00:29,258 --> 01:00:32,258
Which one of these.

714
01:00:32,829 --> 01:00:35,829
Give me the keys.

715
01:00:43,072 --> 01:00:45,474
That's too late.

716
01:00:45,475 --> 01:00:48,475
Time has come.
The chiId will be born.

717
01:01:06,829 --> 01:01:09,031
Where the keys?

718
01:01:09,032 --> 01:01:12,032
Fucking keys!

719
01:01:14,137 --> 01:01:17,137
Shit!

720
01:01:23,346 --> 01:01:26,346
Kim.

721
01:01:40,630 --> 01:01:41,596
You came back.

722
01:01:41,597 --> 01:01:44,166
Kim, I remember you.

723
01:01:44,167 --> 01:01:46,368
Holy god.

724
01:01:46,369 --> 01:01:48,603
The other day, I wasn't sure.

725
01:01:48,604 --> 01:01:49,705
How long has it been since?

726
01:01:49,706 --> 01:01:51,339
I don't know.

727
01:01:51,340 --> 01:01:54,340
Judging by the size of me seven,
maybe eight months.

728
01:01:56,913 --> 01:01:58,613
I didn't even know you are gone.

729
01:01:58,614 --> 01:02:01,614
It wasn't you, Hooke.

730
01:02:02,552 --> 01:02:03,985
You remember?

731
01:02:03,986 --> 01:02:06,455
No meat, no wine, not knowing
why you're pregnant.

732
01:02:06,456 --> 01:02:09,024
I think this ash will hurt the baby.

733
01:02:09,025 --> 01:02:10,325
We gotta get you out of here.

734
01:02:10,326 --> 01:02:13,326
There is a key in the stand by the door.

735
01:02:24,807 --> 01:02:27,807
I miss you.

736
01:02:28,211 --> 01:02:29,544
What about the others?

737
01:02:29,545 --> 01:02:31,713
Gibbs and Jack?

738
01:02:31,714 --> 01:02:34,714
Jack is dead.

739
01:02:35,118 --> 01:02:37,953
God! This is so eviI!

740
01:02:37,954 --> 01:02:40,255
No, we wouId never get out of here!

741
01:02:40,256 --> 01:02:42,891
We just come back and
I can't go back to that cage!

742
01:02:42,892 --> 01:02:44,292
I can't...

743
01:02:44,293 --> 01:02:45,393
Listen. Listen.

744
01:02:45,394 --> 01:02:47,496
We can get out of here, all right?

745
01:02:47,497 --> 01:02:49,498
Everyone. You, me, Gibbs.

746
01:02:49,499 --> 01:02:52,499
We can get out of here
but you need to be strong, understand?

747
01:02:53,302 --> 01:02:55,537
Going somewhere?

748
01:02:55,538 --> 01:02:58,538
I can smell your
when you get in the door.

749
01:02:58,841 --> 01:03:00,275
Get out of my way, lady.

750
01:03:00,276 --> 01:03:03,276
You solve the riddle
and maybe I will let you go.

751
01:03:03,312 --> 01:03:06,312
What will the world look like
at night, night all night.

752
01:03:07,450 --> 01:03:08,917
I don't give a shit!

753
01:03:08,918 --> 01:03:11,918
I'll give you a hand.

754
01:03:17,627 --> 01:03:20,328
It's not real!

755
01:03:20,329 --> 01:03:23,329
None of this is real!

756
01:03:25,935 --> 01:03:27,102
C'mon! We go.

757
01:03:27,103 --> 01:03:30,103
Wait! Wait! We can't just
leave these women like this.

758
01:03:32,775 --> 01:03:35,775
Get out of here. Let's go.

759
01:03:42,185 --> 01:03:45,185
Good Iuck.

760
01:03:54,263 --> 01:03:55,664
What about the others?

761
01:03:55,665 --> 01:03:56,731
Believe me, I tried.

762
01:03:56,732 --> 01:03:57,999
There's nothing
we can do for them now.

763
01:03:58,000 --> 01:03:59,367
I gotta get you out of here.

764
01:03:59,368 --> 01:04:00,702
It's better work.

765
01:04:00,703 --> 01:04:02,237
Do you know where we are going?

766
01:04:02,238 --> 01:04:04,873
I have no idea.
I know there is a portal.

767
01:04:04,874 --> 01:04:06,074
There is onIy way out.

768
01:04:06,075 --> 01:04:07,008
A portal?

769
01:04:07,009 --> 01:04:10,009
Yeah. It's a long story.

770
01:04:14,217 --> 01:04:15,517
What was that?

771
01:04:15,518 --> 01:04:18,518
Previous owner.

772
01:04:21,757 --> 01:04:23,525
Did you see that?

773
01:04:23,526 --> 01:04:26,526
Yeah... that's the portal,
that's the right. Hang on baby.

774
01:05:04,300 --> 01:05:07,300
We did it.

775
01:05:09,205 --> 01:05:11,106
How can I forget how much I love you?

776
01:05:11,107 --> 01:05:13,642
You made that.

777
01:05:13,643 --> 01:05:16,643
You and me, and...

778
01:05:18,481 --> 01:05:20,715
You don't think that is..

779
01:05:20,716 --> 01:05:23,716
Son of the deviI?

780
01:05:23,853 --> 01:05:26,853
I don't know.
It sounds pretty witch shit.

781
01:05:26,989 --> 01:05:29,024
But I know the drug does.

782
01:05:29,025 --> 01:05:31,660
So, what do we do now on me?

783
01:05:31,661 --> 01:05:34,062
Please don't leave us.

784
01:05:34,063 --> 01:05:37,063
No, nobody will.

785
01:05:42,338 --> 01:05:45,338
Wait here.

786
01:05:52,782 --> 01:05:55,782
Just get in.

787
01:05:57,620 --> 01:05:58,954
Look.
What are you doing?

788
01:05:58,955 --> 01:06:01,523
No...you are not going back there.

789
01:06:01,524 --> 01:06:02,324
Kim, I have to.

790
01:06:02,325 --> 01:06:04,459
No! We just got out of there.

791
01:06:04,460 --> 01:06:07,028
What if the chances you
won't make it back out?

792
01:06:07,029 --> 01:06:09,531
What if you forgot again?

793
01:06:09,532 --> 01:06:10,832
Never forget.

794
01:06:10,833 --> 01:06:12,434
You can't just leave me like this.

795
01:06:12,435 --> 01:06:15,103
Listen! He's going
and driving there, okay?

796
01:06:15,104 --> 01:06:16,571
When you get there, wait!

797
01:06:16,572 --> 01:06:19,572
When I come back,
we will get you to the hospital.

798
01:06:19,575 --> 01:06:20,542
We will get you to the hospital.

799
01:06:20,543 --> 01:06:23,543
Everything is going to be ok.
You and the baby.

800
01:06:24,347 --> 01:06:26,614
Promise me.

801
01:06:26,615 --> 01:06:29,615
I promise.

802
01:06:30,519 --> 01:06:33,519
I love you.

803
01:06:33,823 --> 01:06:36,823
All right, Go. Go.

804
01:06:44,467 --> 01:06:47,467
Man, I hope this works.

805
01:06:50,106 --> 01:06:53,106
C'mon, baby! C'mon.

806
01:06:56,212 --> 01:06:59,212
C'mon. C'mon.

807
01:07:38,754 --> 01:07:41,754
Double the dose ash.

808
01:07:42,091 --> 01:07:44,225
You think it's the right time?

809
01:07:44,226 --> 01:07:45,994
Are you questioning me?

810
01:07:45,995 --> 01:07:47,529
One woman is missing.

811
01:07:47,530 --> 01:07:50,530
The other is
scattering around the grounds.

812
01:07:50,599 --> 01:07:52,967
We need to retake control.

813
01:07:52,968 --> 01:07:54,969
Nothing will happen to the babies.

814
01:07:54,970 --> 01:07:56,905
Don't worry.

815
01:07:56,906 --> 01:07:59,906
Coward has no way to go.
Ashes, the chiId.

816
01:08:10,686 --> 01:08:13,686
Ladies and gentlemen,
I think Benedict cooked himseIf tonight.

817
01:08:19,295 --> 01:08:20,261
Where is..

818
01:08:20,262 --> 01:08:23,262
You're looking for someone?

819
01:08:24,700 --> 01:08:26,968
Where is Gibbs?

820
01:08:26,969 --> 01:08:28,002
Who is Gibbs?

821
01:08:28,003 --> 01:08:29,838
I don't know anybody's name Gibbs.

822
01:08:29,839 --> 01:08:31,139
Yes, you do.

823
01:08:31,140 --> 01:08:32,774
You all do.

824
01:08:32,775 --> 01:08:34,476
You flirt with him every night.

825
01:08:34,477 --> 01:08:36,244
You all know him.

826
01:08:36,245 --> 01:08:38,680
Peter! Think.

827
01:08:38,681 --> 01:08:39,547
Do I know you?

828
01:08:39,548 --> 01:08:42,283
Yes, you know me.

829
01:08:42,284 --> 01:08:44,085
You and Diane know me real well.

830
01:08:44,086 --> 01:08:45,954
Sweety, we've never met before.

831
01:08:45,955 --> 01:08:48,955
Peter! C'mon. Think. Spend the vacation.

832
01:08:49,792 --> 01:08:52,594
God knows how you and your shit hole!

833
01:08:52,595 --> 01:08:54,162
But you know boss can't...

834
01:08:54,163 --> 01:08:57,163
get by without me?

835
01:09:00,102 --> 01:09:02,403
How long have we been here?

836
01:09:02,404 --> 01:09:04,005
He is obviousIy confused.

837
01:09:04,006 --> 01:09:04,873
Don't listen to him.

838
01:09:04,874 --> 01:09:05,840
What's going on here?

839
01:09:05,841 --> 01:09:07,142
Yea, who are you?

840
01:09:07,143 --> 01:09:10,143
Roy! How long have you been here?

841
01:09:10,412 --> 01:09:11,846
I came in here yesterday, Sir.

842
01:09:11,847 --> 01:09:14,215
Hey, you can cut the sir crap!

843
01:09:14,216 --> 01:09:16,117
I'm Hooke.

844
01:09:16,118 --> 01:09:19,118
With an E. Any relationship with Ohio.

845
01:09:19,488 --> 01:09:22,223
How many god damn times
you say that one?

846
01:09:22,224 --> 01:09:25,224
You are overwheImed.
Sit, have a glass of wine.

847
01:09:28,063 --> 01:09:30,131
It will make you feeI better.

848
01:09:30,132 --> 01:09:33,132
You sit down. Sit!

849
01:09:39,675 --> 01:09:41,776
He comes here alone, Roy?

850
01:09:41,777 --> 01:09:44,777
Yes, we did.

851
01:09:45,714 --> 01:09:48,714
Is that right, sister?

852
01:09:48,918 --> 01:09:51,918
Answer me!

853
01:09:53,923 --> 01:09:55,223
No.

854
01:09:55,224 --> 01:09:58,224
No, is the name
Susan ring the bell, Roy?

855
01:09:59,161 --> 01:10:00,495
Susan?

856
01:10:00,496 --> 01:10:02,931
It's your wife, Roy.

857
01:10:02,932 --> 01:10:04,199
Look that newspaper you have been read.

858
01:10:04,200 --> 01:10:07,200
How many times you read that?
It's four months old.

859
01:10:08,604 --> 01:10:10,438
I don't understand.

860
01:10:10,439 --> 01:10:12,307
Oh my god! Susi...

861
01:10:12,308 --> 01:10:14,375
Yeah, that's right.

862
01:10:14,376 --> 01:10:17,376
Now, where is Gibbs?

863
01:10:20,216 --> 01:10:23,216
I don't know what you are talking about.

864
01:10:23,919 --> 01:10:26,919
Where is Gibbs?

865
01:10:29,391 --> 01:10:32,391
You didn't think you can run for mess
with that consequence, did you?

866
01:10:40,202 --> 01:10:43,104
Clean these plates. All but one.

867
01:10:43,105 --> 01:10:43,705
But...

868
01:10:43,706 --> 01:10:45,440
Do it!

869
01:10:45,441 --> 01:10:48,441
Or I will kill her right here,
right now.

870
01:10:50,246 --> 01:10:53,246
Do it.

871
01:10:54,416 --> 01:10:55,316
So ladies and gentlemen,

872
01:10:55,317 --> 01:10:58,317
looks like our host is going to
join us for dinner for once.

873
01:11:00,322 --> 01:11:02,023
I can't eat that.

874
01:11:02,024 --> 01:11:05,024
Why, it's delicious, right?

875
01:11:05,527 --> 01:11:08,527
Benedict did that himseIf, didn't he?

876
01:11:09,131 --> 01:11:11,065
You don't understand.

877
01:11:11,066 --> 01:11:14,066
I'm not like you.

878
01:11:14,303 --> 01:11:17,303
We will find out.

879
01:11:17,506 --> 01:11:18,239
Eat.

880
01:11:18,240 --> 01:11:21,240
No.

881
01:11:23,012 --> 01:11:25,947
Eat!

882
01:11:25,948 --> 01:11:28,948
Eat it!

883
01:11:31,987 --> 01:11:34,987
Benedict!

884
01:11:36,125 --> 01:11:37,125
Benedict!

885
01:11:37,126 --> 01:11:39,594
Elizabeth!

886
01:11:39,595 --> 01:11:40,662
I eat in the ash.

887
01:11:40,663 --> 01:11:43,663
You ate something.

888
01:11:45,234 --> 01:11:46,968
She is dying. Do something.

889
01:11:46,969 --> 01:11:49,570
She eats the ash. Nothing I can do.

890
01:11:49,571 --> 01:11:50,905
They're gonna remember.

891
01:11:50,906 --> 01:11:53,608
It doesn't matter, they can't stop this!

892
01:11:53,609 --> 01:11:54,976
Where is Susan?

893
01:11:54,977 --> 01:11:56,210
Oh my god!

894
01:11:56,211 --> 01:11:57,912
Scott!

895
01:11:57,913 --> 01:11:59,714
I came here with my mom.

896
01:11:59,715 --> 01:12:02,715
Where is my mom?

897
01:12:07,356 --> 01:12:09,524
What's happening to her?

898
01:12:09,525 --> 01:12:10,958
We can't do it without her.

899
01:12:10,959 --> 01:12:13,959
The trinity is broken.

900
01:12:14,463 --> 01:12:16,297
It's quite failed for the cover.

901
01:12:16,298 --> 01:12:18,366
And it will make him a hero
and they will give him all the glory!

902
01:12:18,367 --> 01:12:20,702
No one wouId get the shit,
for the eternity!

903
01:12:20,703 --> 01:12:23,338
Get control of yourseIf.

904
01:12:23,339 --> 01:12:26,074
We are not finished.
Not when we get this close.

905
01:12:26,075 --> 01:12:29,075
Find Charon. Karin and her nurse
will take care of the guests.

906
01:12:32,915 --> 01:12:35,083
Get to the office. We will keep back.

907
01:12:35,084 --> 01:12:36,584
No...no...no.. I'm not leaving you.

908
01:12:36,585 --> 01:12:37,719
Get out here, we will find you.

909
01:12:37,720 --> 01:12:39,487
No. I am staying with you.
Please.

910
01:12:39,488 --> 01:12:42,488
Peter, the table! Let's go.

911
01:12:44,793 --> 01:12:47,793
No, no. Get out of him.

912
01:12:48,230 --> 01:12:51,230
Leave him alone.

913
01:12:51,500 --> 01:12:54,500
Oh my god, Peter.

914
01:13:28,871 --> 01:13:31,871
Oh, shit!

915
01:13:56,765 --> 01:13:59,765
Gibbs.

916
01:14:05,007 --> 01:14:08,007
Hooke? Nora?

917
01:14:10,679 --> 01:14:13,281
It's me, Nora.

918
01:14:13,282 --> 01:14:14,949
Where is Hooke?

919
01:14:14,950 --> 01:14:16,517
I thought he was with you.

920
01:14:16,518 --> 01:14:18,986
Oh my god! Oh my god!

921
01:14:18,987 --> 01:14:21,987
We are gonna die
just like all the others.

922
01:14:22,024 --> 01:14:23,024
No, we are not.

923
01:14:23,025 --> 01:14:26,025
We gonna find Hooke.

924
01:14:38,841 --> 01:14:40,341
Hooke, Hooke.

925
01:14:40,342 --> 01:14:43,342
Thank god! We found you.

926
01:14:43,645 --> 01:14:45,179
I thought you were dead too.

927
01:14:45,180 --> 01:14:48,180
We get out of here, now,
all right? C'mon.

928
01:15:12,908 --> 01:15:15,908
Shit!

929
01:15:16,211 --> 01:15:19,211
Keys! Keys...

930
01:15:19,615 --> 01:15:22,615
Shit!

931
01:15:22,751 --> 01:15:25,751
Oh! Fuck!

932
01:15:31,159 --> 01:15:34,159
Fuck me!

933
01:15:36,532 --> 01:15:38,466
Fuck!

934
01:15:38,467 --> 01:15:41,467
Fuck! No. Come on!

935
01:15:48,043 --> 01:15:51,043
You have no idea what you've done.

936
01:15:51,914 --> 01:15:53,614
You never got finished now.

937
01:15:53,615 --> 01:15:55,683
No driver. No key.

938
01:15:55,684 --> 01:15:58,684
Damn it to hell.
This not what I signed that book!

939
01:15:58,720 --> 01:15:59,921
We got out, you know.

940
01:15:59,922 --> 01:16:02,123
Right through the portal.

941
01:16:02,124 --> 01:16:03,491
Then you must have the key!

942
01:16:03,492 --> 01:16:05,593
Just give him the key for God's sake.

943
01:16:05,594 --> 01:16:06,928
That's right.

944
01:16:06,929 --> 01:16:08,663
For God's sake.

945
01:16:08,664 --> 01:16:10,598
OK.

946
01:16:10,599 --> 01:16:13,599
All right!

947
01:16:15,938 --> 01:16:16,871
There you go.

948
01:16:16,872 --> 01:16:19,872
This is the way out. This is key.

949
01:16:32,287 --> 01:16:35,287
Van! Get to the van!

950
01:16:35,757 --> 01:16:38,757
Keys!

951
01:16:48,637 --> 01:16:49,704
It's over.

952
01:16:49,705 --> 01:16:52,006
You have no idea.

953
01:16:52,007 --> 01:16:54,442
This is just the beginning.

954
01:16:54,443 --> 01:16:56,877
You don't need us anymore.
Just let us go.

955
01:16:56,878 --> 01:16:59,878
What I need is the chiId. I need it now.

956
01:18:04,146 --> 01:18:07,146
Push!

957
01:18:14,189 --> 01:18:16,090
Is everything ok?

958
01:18:16,091 --> 01:18:18,926
Everything is fine.

959
01:18:18,927 --> 01:18:21,927
Congratulations.
You have a very healthy baby.

960
01:18:22,964 --> 01:18:24,365
A girl?

961
01:18:24,366 --> 01:18:27,366
A beautifuI girl.

962
01:18:30,472 --> 01:18:33,307
See, I told you so
everything has gone right

963
01:18:33,308 --> 01:18:36,077
Hello.

964
01:18:36,078 --> 01:18:39,078
Here is mommy.

965
01:18:42,184 --> 01:18:44,785
Are you sure anything
is going to be okay?

966
01:18:44,786 --> 01:18:47,786
Yeah. I'm certain. It's new beginning.

967
01:18:49,324 --> 01:18:52,324
Yeah. I'm certain. It's newbegginning.
