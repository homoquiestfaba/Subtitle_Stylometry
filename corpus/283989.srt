1
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:09,255
<i>I wish I died that time</i>

2
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:14,532
<i>but</i>

3
00:02:19,405 --> 00:02:23,171
<i>I'm still alive.</i>

4
00:02:52,572 --> 00:02:55,166
Know a cafe named Venus?

5
00:03:01,214 --> 00:03:03,978
<i>There's no reason to be in this town.</i>

6
00:03:12,559 --> 00:03:15,892
<i>Likewise, there's</i>
<i>no reason to leave this town.</i>

7
00:03:19,432 --> 00:03:24,233
<i>Day in day out,</i>
<i>every day is the same.</i>

8
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:25,860
Damn!

9
00:03:32,078 --> 00:03:34,239
Drop dead, you drunkard!

10
00:03:34,948 --> 00:03:40,250
<i>WIFE's shrieks</i>
<i>pierce my ears.</i>

11
00:03:42,355 --> 00:03:47,224
<i>DOCTOR's stench</i>
<i>Is offensive to my nose.</i>

12
00:03:50,964 --> 00:03:52,955
You good-for-nothing.

13
00:03:57,770 --> 00:03:58,600
Ouch.

14
00:04:03,743 --> 00:04:07,008
<i>SODA goes to work</i>
<i>at the florist.</i>

15
00:04:16,489 --> 00:04:18,980
<i>A break in the</i>
<i>monotony, once...</i>

16
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:22,988
<i>BOY got</i>
<i>an old revolver</i>
<i>somewhere</i>

17
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:31,461
<i>and became</i>
<i>a self-acclaimed hit man.</i>

18
00:04:40,913 --> 00:04:43,108
HIT MAN

19
00:04:51,824 --> 00:04:56,158
<i>VENUS always sits</i>
<i>In the same place</i>

20
00:05:18,685 --> 00:05:24,214
<i>and I'm always here</i>
<i>at the same time</i>

21
00:05:29,128 --> 00:05:32,063
<i>to perform the same chores.</i>

22
00:05:37,904 --> 00:05:39,030
You have tea?

23
00:05:46,145 --> 00:05:47,373
What about cola?

24
00:05:55,788 --> 00:05:58,621
COFFEE - VENUS BLEND

25
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:01,427
Coffee.

26
00:06:03,963 --> 00:06:05,487
Venus Blend?

27
00:06:07,834 --> 00:06:09,324
What else is there?

28
00:06:12,472 --> 00:06:15,669
<i>I'm... stlll alive.</i>

29
00:06:17,677 --> 00:06:19,770
<i>There's no meaning to it.</i>

30
00:06:21,848 --> 00:06:26,581
<i>I'm not dead.</i>
<i>That's all there is to it.</i>

31
00:06:26,686 --> 00:06:27,880
Welcome.

32
00:06:53,613 --> 00:06:55,274
There's only coffee

33
00:06:58,217 --> 00:06:59,184
Two coffees.

34
00:07:07,827 --> 00:07:09,317
Good morning, VENUS.

35
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:10,657
Good morning.

36
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:12,088
And...

37
00:07:12,198 --> 00:07:13,130
Dirty ol' man.

38
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:19,704
And show me Venus's back.

39
00:07:22,241 --> 00:07:24,141
Venus's back ...

40
00:07:25,711 --> 00:07:27,110
Show it to me.

41
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:34,887
<i>I had almost forgotten</i>
<i>those words.</i>

42
00:07:39,592 --> 00:07:42,060
<i>It is the time</i>
<i>when nameless people...</i>

43
00:07:42,161 --> 00:07:43,321
Coffee.

44
00:07:44,797 --> 00:07:49,257
<i>... live,</i>
<i>hiding names</i>
<i>they don't even have.</i>

45
00:07:50,903 --> 00:07:52,063
And...

46
00:07:55,975 --> 00:07:58,808
Please show me Venus's back

47
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:16,189
<i>It's the password</i>
<i>to the hideaway</i>
<i>Inside this old cafe.</i>

48
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:33,002
RULES FOR LONG-TERM GUESTS

49
00:10:05,137 --> 00:10:07,401
Use it any way you want.

50
00:10:15,414 --> 00:10:16,972
I'm CHONAN...

51
00:10:20,319 --> 00:10:22,412
whatever you like.

52
00:10:22,555 --> 00:10:25,023
No one uses his real name here.

53
00:10:28,494 --> 00:10:29,552
It's GUY.

54
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:41,968
She's SAI.

55
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:44,602
How old are you?

56
00:10:49,682 --> 00:10:50,842
Let her alone.

57
00:11:12,271 --> 00:11:13,397
Meal's ready.

58
00:11:17,543 --> 00:11:19,408
I'll have it later.

59
00:11:26,852 --> 00:11:28,183
Mea 's downstairs.

60
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:32,318
Do you hear me?

61
00:11:36,195 --> 00:11:37,492
I'm going out

62
00:11:58,250 --> 00:11:59,444
SAI?

63
00:12:12,865 --> 00:12:14,560
Is that the man?

64
00:12:18,871 --> 00:12:20,133
How's his daughter?

65
00:12:20,906 --> 00:12:22,339
Won't even answer.

66
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:24,903
Like her dear dad?

67
00:12:26,278 --> 00:12:28,712
Better than the shrill here.

68
00:12:32,384 --> 00:12:35,751
There's something
very manly about him...

69
00:12:36,021 --> 00:12:38,819
You're womanly, too, WIFE.

70
00:12:39,825 --> 00:12:46,094
How long must I earn money
with my womanly charms?

71
00:13:31,977 --> 00:13:33,808
I think that's enough.

72
00:13:37,116 --> 00:13:39,846
How can WIFE put up with you?

73
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:44,482
DOCTOR.

74
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:52,029
<i>Here,</i>
<i>we call each other</i>
<i>by names of no consequence.</i>

75
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:57,530
<i>If a name has</i>
<i>a meaning</i>
<i>or a hint of hope</i>

76
00:13:58,404 --> 00:14:02,636
<i>that person will despair</i>
<i>because of that name.</i>

77
00:14:04,376 --> 00:14:08,142
<i>Everyone here...is</i>
<i>well aware of that.</i>

78
00:14:13,552 --> 00:14:15,884
<i>DOCTOR must have</i>
<i>a hard time</i>

79
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:18,656
<i>because</i>

80
00:14:19,091 --> 00:14:22,151
<i>DOCTOR is no longer</i>
<i>a doctor.</i>

81
00:14:26,932 --> 00:14:28,661
I kept your meal.

82
00:14:40,479 --> 00:14:42,845
You went to find work?

83
00:14:45,918 --> 00:14:49,319
Found an opening
at a construction site.

84
00:14:51,223 --> 00:14:53,020
Daily laborer, huh?

85
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:55,454
That's hard work.

86
00:15:32,965 --> 00:15:35,866
Do you have to do it everyday?

87
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:40,098
<i>It's not that</i>

88
00:15:40,205 --> 00:15:42,696
<i>I'm trying to be</i>
<i>kind to SAI.</i>

89
00:15:43,208 --> 00:15:45,768
<i>I just want her</i>
<i>to act normal.</i>

90
00:15:45,878 --> 00:15:48,847
<i>Otherwise,</i>
<i>it's too much of a hassle.</i>

91
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:51,040
Can't you stop that?

92
00:15:53,552 --> 00:15:54,576
Damn you!

93
00:15:58,257 --> 00:16:00,020
Another quarrel?

94
00:16:01,827 --> 00:16:04,819
Wish it really was a quarrel.

95
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:06,324
He's clammed up.

96
00:16:08,267 --> 00:16:10,235
Some quarrel, my ass.

97
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:18,034
I'm coming in.

98
00:16:33,459 --> 00:16:35,120
Why don't you eat?

99
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:44,162
You're not among enemies

100
00:16:48,374 --> 00:16:51,502
We I, not exactly friends, but...

101
00:16:59,318 --> 00:17:02,617
Do you always wait for your dad?

102
00:17:14,066 --> 00:17:16,398
I'm sure you can talk.

103
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:23,140
We're not your family and
you don't have to be friendly.

104
00:17:24,743 --> 00:17:26,404
So...just eat.

105
00:17:27,346 --> 00:17:29,143
It'll be a hassle

106
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:31,842
if you starve here.

107
00:17:34,019 --> 00:17:36,146
The girl's eyes.

108
00:17:37,623 --> 00:17:39,853
You used to have those eyes.

109
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:44,226
What do you mean?

110
00:17:46,865 --> 00:17:49,356
Like "don't come close to me

111
00:17:49,935 --> 00:17:52,927
but don't leave me a one."

112
00:17:53,839 --> 00:17:55,329
Eyes saying that.

113
00:17:56,642 --> 00:17:59,076
Her heart is not locked.

114
00:17:59,845 --> 00:18:04,782
But she doesn't know how to open it.

115
00:18:13,058 --> 00:18:16,084
<i>I don't think</i>
<i>she means any trouble.</i>

116
00:19:08,013 --> 00:19:09,378
Come with me.

117
00:21:00,225 --> 00:21:02,318
There's lots more.

118
00:21:56,748 --> 00:21:57,772
WIFE.

119
00:21:58,717 --> 00:22:00,412
All well with DOCTOR?

120
00:22:00,752 --> 00:22:01,650
Why ask?

121
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:04,755
Don't hear shouts recently.

122
00:22:06,725 --> 00:22:09,819
We're not kids.
We don't quarrel everyday.

123
00:22:12,064 --> 00:22:13,122
C'mon

124
00:22:13,298 --> 00:22:14,697
We don't.

125
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,631
Then you two are happy together.

126
00:22:19,671 --> 00:22:24,836
Must be the sex, huh?

127
00:22:25,877 --> 00:22:27,003
Shut up.

128
00:22:28,447 --> 00:22:32,008
WIFE and DOCTOR go beyond
such things.

129
00:22:34,486 --> 00:22:39,480
I guess it's impossible here
with those paper-thin walls.

130
00:22:39,591 --> 00:22:41,252
C'mon, eat more.

131
00:22:51,169 --> 00:22:52,227
CHONAN.

132
00:22:53,705 --> 00:22:55,502
Won't SAI eat with us?

133
00:23:14,025 --> 00:23:15,754
Clothes in the basket.

134
00:23:18,597 --> 00:23:20,087
Laundry service.

135
00:23:22,801 --> 00:23:24,598
It's free of charge.

136
00:23:30,809 --> 00:23:31,741
Hey.

137
00:23:44,122 --> 00:23:48,957
The shower won't get
the booze out of my system, will it?

138
00:24:05,010 --> 00:24:06,102
Why...

139
00:24:09,181 --> 00:24:10,978
Why did you come here?

140
00:24:18,957 --> 00:24:20,549
Why are you here?

141
00:24:23,695 --> 00:24:29,725
Probably because I'm
an utterly good-for-nothing person.

142
00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:31,932
I got you.

143
00:24:32,037 --> 00:24:34,665
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

144
00:25:09,508 --> 00:25:11,032
I'll be ready soon

145
00:25:12,844 --> 00:25:14,436
It's DOCTOR and WIFE.

146
00:25:17,983 --> 00:25:20,247
I think WIFE's crying.

147
00:25:30,762 --> 00:25:32,662
It's out of question.

148
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:37,893
He told me to get out

149
00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:40,165
Never told you that.

150
00:25:41,373 --> 00:25:43,000
I could leave.

151
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:45,468
What is this, anyway?

152
00:25:50,282 --> 00:25:52,443
Why do you clam up?

153
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:56,851
Why are you dissatisfied?

154
00:25:57,722 --> 00:26:01,783
I earn enough money...
and we have a decent life

155
00:26:04,362 --> 00:26:08,799
Do you realize what I have to
go through to earn money?

156
00:26:10,035 --> 00:26:11,627
I do it all for you.

157
00:26:14,539 --> 00:26:17,064
Who pays for your drink s?

158
00:26:17,175 --> 00:26:18,301
WIFE.

159
00:26:25,183 --> 00:26:27,117
I am so disappointed.

160
00:26:40,732 --> 00:26:42,131
What's going on?

161
00:26:42,701 --> 00:26:44,532
This is what's going on.

162
00:26:46,071 --> 00:26:48,767
I knew this was going to happen.

163
00:26:50,775 --> 00:26:52,106
Does she

164
00:26:54,412 --> 00:26:56,937
want to be with me?

165
00:26:58,049 --> 00:26:59,516
That's why she's here

166
00:27:05,924 --> 00:27:07,414
and gets angry.

167
00:27:07,525 --> 00:27:11,928
Maybe she's unaware that
she doesn't want to be with me.

168
00:27:13,431 --> 00:27:15,092
I don't think

169
00:27:15,767 --> 00:27:18,634
she'll be happy here.

170
00:27:21,573 --> 00:27:23,404
Say something.

171
00:27:24,442 --> 00:27:26,740
She shouldn't be here.

172
00:27:26,878 --> 00:27:29,108
That's for her to decide.

173
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:38,121
I think she's unable to decide.

174
00:27:44,262 --> 00:27:46,787
I'm a hopeless loser...

175
00:27:48,033 --> 00:27:50,831
But she's such a sweet creature.

176
00:27:54,205 --> 00:27:57,436
He used to be a good doctor

177
00:27:58,543 --> 00:28:00,568
About a decade ago

178
00:28:00,945 --> 00:28:05,405
everyone in this neighborhood
relied on him.

179
00:28:07,385 --> 00:28:12,186
He was such a good-natured man,
and never refused any patients.

180
00:28:15,193 --> 00:28:16,490
Why did he quit?

181
00:28:17,862 --> 00:28:19,853
Because of his error

182
00:28:20,765 --> 00:28:26,533
during an operation
He crippled a patient for lif e.

183
00:28:30,041 --> 00:28:34,978
He's absolutely convinced of that.

184
00:28:36,781 --> 00:28:39,545
It really wasn't an error.

185
00:28:40,285 --> 00:28:43,049
It wasn't all his fault.

186
00:28:47,358 --> 00:28:52,728
The only one blaming him is himself.

187
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:59,166
And...he quit it all.

188
00:29:01,072 --> 00:29:05,065
I don't know
what he's depressed about.

189
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:11,105
People are

190
00:29:11,983 --> 00:29:15,146
so sensitive to their wounds

191
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:17,888
but not to wounds of others.

192
00:29:29,067 --> 00:29:30,432
How's SAI?

193
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:34,071
She's eating now.

194
00:29:35,173 --> 00:29:38,074
You're keeping her company?

195
00:29:39,177 --> 00:29:43,944
No, I get her to help me
to lighten my work load.

196
00:30:05,603 --> 00:30:10,267
<i>When someone's heart</i>
<i>opens up a bit</i>

197
00:30:19,050 --> 00:30:23,987
<i>someone else's heart</i>
<i>begins to close.</i>

198
00:30:27,225 --> 00:30:29,125
Tell me what's wrong

199
00:30:43,942 --> 00:30:45,068
Thank you.

200
00:31:31,322 --> 00:31:32,812
Can I have one?

201
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:37,953
A woman should think of her child.

202
00:31:39,864 --> 00:31:43,231
You're an old-fashioned person.

203
00:31:45,336 --> 00:31:46,860
Don't worry.

204
00:31:47,472 --> 00:31:51,203
My body, fortunately,
is no longer good for that.

205
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:21,770
If we had kids, I'm sure
things would've been different.

206
00:32:26,477 --> 00:32:29,935
How do you like this town?

207
00:32:33,217 --> 00:32:34,878
Guess you don't.

208
00:32:38,189 --> 00:32:41,955
City is where you cannot live in.

209
00:32:43,695 --> 00:32:48,655
Home is where you cannot go back to.

210
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:52,095
Drifting north and further north...

211
00:32:52,837 --> 00:32:54,771
tossed here and there...

212
00:32:56,507 --> 00:32:58,771
This is the town you reached.

213
00:33:08,519 --> 00:33:10,009
This place

214
00:33:10,788 --> 00:33:14,747
is inhabited by drifters
with reasons of their own.

215
00:33:16,427 --> 00:33:18,588
It's a strange place

216
00:33:20,932 --> 00:33:25,801
Because of that,
we can be redeemed at times.

217
00:33:43,354 --> 00:33:46,016
It smells of cigarettes.

218
00:33:48,726 --> 00:33:52,457
What does SAI look like
when she smiles?

219
00:35:11,509 --> 00:35:15,468
If someone's existence
is like a pair of shackles

220
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:20,676
it makes everyone unable to move.

221
00:35:22,019 --> 00:35:24,044
Such a life is no good.

222
00:35:29,861 --> 00:35:32,125
I'm in your way?

223
00:35:37,568 --> 00:35:39,058
It's over?

224
00:35:42,373 --> 00:35:45,570
It was long over.

225
00:35:46,811 --> 00:35:48,438
You can't decide that.

226
00:35:48,579 --> 00:35:50,740
You shouldn't be here.

227
00:35:51,215 --> 00:35:52,773
Go somewhere.

228
00:35:54,619 --> 00:35:57,144
Find someone stronger than me.

229
00:35:57,555 --> 00:35:59,546
Go? Go where?

230
00:35:59,924 --> 00:36:01,653
To someone like GUY.

231
00:36:18,543 --> 00:36:19,669
SAI...

232
00:36:24,081 --> 00:36:26,811
How long are you going to eat here?

233
00:36:30,421 --> 00:36:34,255
Let's eat together. C'mon, just once.

234
00:36:46,204 --> 00:36:47,262
SAI.

235
00:37:44,895 --> 00:37:46,328
You, too, VENUS.

236
00:38:06,684 --> 00:38:07,810
Let's eat.

237
00:38:43,087 --> 00:38:47,319
<i>Seelng SAI</i>
<i>surrounded,</i>
<i>WIFE smiled...</i>

238
00:39:00,571 --> 00:39:05,099
<i>And after that,</i>
<i>she went out</i>
<i>and did not return.</i>

239
00:39:09,146 --> 00:39:13,913
<i>Romance is perhaps</i>
<i>what you</i>
<i>want to enjoy.</i>

240
00:39:14,852 --> 00:39:19,084
<i>Love is perhaps</i>
<i>what you don't</i>
<i>want to lose.</i>

241
00:39:19,790 --> 00:39:23,021
<i>But it's not</i>
<i>that simple.</i>

242
00:39:23,761 --> 00:39:29,825
<i>It's hard to believe</i>
<i>there was never</i>
<i>any lo ve between DOCTOR and WIFE.</i>

243
00:39:31,869 --> 00:39:32,893
SAI.

244
00:39:33,437 --> 00:39:35,837
One more chore from today.

245
00:41:07,331 --> 00:41:08,662
Be careful.

246
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:45,828
I've been itchng to ask you.

247
00:41:47,738 --> 00:41:49,569
Ever killed anyone?

248
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:53,602
Not yet.

249
00:41:55,112 --> 00:41:57,239
There's always the first time.

250
00:41:59,316 --> 00:42:02,479
Asked DUSTER to pass me a contract.

251
00:42:05,756 --> 00:42:07,314
Hey, I'm not a kid.

252
00:42:15,566 --> 00:42:17,227
I'm all grown-up now.

253
00:42:17,935 --> 00:42:20,233
But most aren't hit men.

254
00:42:21,805 --> 00:42:23,705
Because they're all wimps

255
00:42:24,441 --> 00:42:27,535
I'm the strongest man on earth.

256
00:42:28,512 --> 00:42:30,002
Doesn't suit you.

257
00:42:30,648 --> 00:42:33,208
No one will seriously hire you.

258
00:42:36,954 --> 00:42:38,615
A hit man has

259
00:42:43,594 --> 00:42:45,425
an air like him.

260
00:42:51,068 --> 00:42:52,330
Your SAI...

261
00:42:57,341 --> 00:42:59,070
I sometimes borrow her.

262
00:42:59,910 --> 00:43:01,434
For laundry service.

263
00:43:08,185 --> 00:43:09,777
She smiled a bit.

264
00:43:21,065 --> 00:43:23,158
Don't meddle with us.

265
00:43:25,469 --> 00:43:26,731
Do you enjoy it?

266
00:43:42,686 --> 00:43:44,984
What's manly about him?

267
00:46:02,459 --> 00:46:04,120
Why're you here?

268
00:46:05,729 --> 00:46:07,196
To buy flowers.

269
00:46:08,432 --> 00:46:09,956
Do you work here?

270
00:46:11,068 --> 00:46:12,660
Yes, I do.

271
00:46:19,643 --> 00:46:22,737
Was that your boyfriend?

272
00:47:35,552 --> 00:47:36,951
Take care of this.

273
00:48:40,117 --> 00:48:41,584
Give this to her.

274
00:48:48,458 --> 00:48:50,449
Tomorrow's her birthday.

275
00:48:53,163 --> 00:48:54,357
To SAI?

276
00:48:57,601 --> 00:48:59,501
Give it to her yourself.

277
00:49:04,007 --> 00:49:05,372
She smiles. Right?

278
00:49:08,946 --> 00:49:12,347
She smiles in front of you,
doesn't she?

279
00:49:16,653 --> 00:49:18,245
Please give it to her.

280
00:49:42,145 --> 00:49:43,134
It's for you.

281
00:49:47,718 --> 00:49:49,208
A gift from GUY.

282
00:49:51,989 --> 00:49:53,820
Now I get it.

283
00:49:54,992 --> 00:49:55,890
Get what?

284
00:49:56,326 --> 00:49:58,794
Came to buy that yesterday.

285
00:50:23,420 --> 00:50:25,786
GUY... I'm so sorry.

286
00:50:31,061 --> 00:50:32,995
No need to apologize.

287
00:50:33,430 --> 00:50:36,991
He's right, CHONAN
Why apologize to him?

288
00:50:47,277 --> 00:50:48,767
You need that?

289
00:50:48,879 --> 00:50:50,005
For my job

290
00:50:50,113 --> 00:50:51,171
Your job?

291
00:50:54,117 --> 00:50:55,243
That's dangerous.

292
00:50:56,553 --> 00:50:59,420
Of course it is. It's a dangerous job.

293
00:51:02,993 --> 00:51:04,961
I earn a decent living.

294
00:51:05,896 --> 00:51:07,022
So?

295
00:51:07,731 --> 00:51:08,993
I don't like that.

296
00:51:13,537 --> 00:51:17,200
Don't meddle with
other people's affairs. Right?

297
00:51:22,312 --> 00:51:24,143
No wonder she hates you.

298
00:51:24,247 --> 00:51:24,804
BOY.

299
00:51:26,817 --> 00:51:29,684
Don't take your frustration out on me.

300
00:51:32,255 --> 00:51:34,018
I'll blow you away.

301
00:51:38,929 --> 00:51:40,988
I'll blow you away.

302
00:51:41,298 --> 00:51:42,287
BOY.

303
00:51:54,010 --> 00:51:57,741
It was more than 10 years ago.

304
00:51:59,116 --> 00:52:04,053
A woman came here with her little son.

305
00:52:05,122 --> 00:52:07,215
She ordered coffee, and...

306
00:52:08,325 --> 00:52:12,955
before we knew it,
she disappeared. Just like that.

307
00:52:14,464 --> 00:52:18,423
She left her son, and took off.

308
00:52:19,336 --> 00:52:24,296
She never returned.
It's so typical of this town

309
00:52:26,209 --> 00:52:32,079
The boy kept waiting
for his mother's return.

310
00:52:34,818 --> 00:52:41,747
If he stopped waiting he'd have to
admit he was abandoned.

311
00:52:44,161 --> 00:52:49,155
But the fact is he was abandoned.

312
00:52:58,141 --> 00:53:02,271
The boy blamed himself.

313
00:53:04,114 --> 00:53:07,948
He thought it was because
he was weak.

314
00:53:09,319 --> 00:53:11,150
He thought

315
00:53:11,454 --> 00:53:15,322
his mother would return,
if he became strong.

316
00:53:17,460 --> 00:53:19,985
He said he wanted to be strong.

317
00:53:26,536 --> 00:53:31,473
He still doesn't know
what it is to be strong.

318
00:53:34,110 --> 00:53:36,203
Such a foolish boy ...

319
00:53:39,015 --> 00:53:40,346
Hurry up

320
00:53:41,551 --> 00:53:42,575
Hurry what?

321
00:53:43,186 --> 00:53:44,983
The contract.

322
00:53:47,157 --> 00:53:49,022
I'm already for it.

323
00:53:49,759 --> 00:53:50,919
You're not joking?

324
00:53:51,595 --> 00:53:53,620
I never joke.

325
00:53:54,631 --> 00:53:57,259
I'm ready to blow away any target.

326
00:53:58,335 --> 00:54:00,269
Just get me a contract.

327
00:55:14,311 --> 00:55:15,710
Welcome home.

328
00:55:19,049 --> 00:55:20,482
Ah ...I'm home.

329
00:55:25,121 --> 00:55:27,248
You didn't drink before.

330
00:55:28,058 --> 00:55:31,357
I guess I drank too much... Good night.

331
00:55:39,302 --> 00:55:40,394
CHONAN.

332
00:55:42,839 --> 00:55:44,397
Been here many years?

333
00:55:46,343 --> 00:55:47,708
Three years.

334
00:55:51,548 --> 00:55:53,209
Would that be long?

335
00:55:54,584 --> 00:55:56,449
Or would it be short?

336
00:56:00,557 --> 00:56:02,286
<i>It's hard to tell.</i>

337
00:56:03,793 --> 00:56:06,762
<i>My time stopped moving</i>
<i>long ago.</i>

338
00:56:26,082 --> 00:56:29,882
CHONAN

339
00:57:42,659 --> 00:57:44,058
Isn't SAI here?

340
00:57:54,370 --> 00:57:56,031
Hey, lets chat.

341
00:58:06,683 --> 00:58:08,617
That flower

342
00:58:11,454 --> 00:58:14,946
in the pot you broke

343
00:58:18,828 --> 00:58:20,591
is called anemone.

344
00:58:22,532 --> 00:58:24,227
It means "wind"

345
00:58:28,805 --> 00:58:32,468
because its petals quickly
fall when wind blows.

346
00:58:35,044 --> 00:58:37,103
It's not really true.

347
00:58:39,516 --> 00:58:41,108
Do you know why?

348
00:58:45,021 --> 00:58:49,981
Anemone seeds fly far, far away,
riding the wind.

349
00:58:53,396 --> 00:58:57,924
The seeds will try to
start a new life somewhere

350
00:59:00,236 --> 00:59:01,464
and they will

351
00:59:03,439 --> 00:59:08,843
try to bloom at whatever odds.
They don't give up easily.

352
00:59:10,346 --> 00:59:13,008
Wish I could be like anemone

353
00:59:15,118 --> 00:59:16,847
What about anemone?

354
00:59:18,021 --> 00:59:20,512
Sorry. I overheard a bit.

355
00:59:23,293 --> 00:59:26,126
I wasn't talking for SAI.

356
00:59:27,397 --> 00:59:29,695
I was saying it to myself.

357
00:59:36,806 --> 00:59:39,104
Why are you here?

358
00:59:43,780 --> 00:59:46,214
Won't do much good anyway

359
00:59:51,621 --> 00:59:53,418
I have a dream.

360
00:59:54,791 --> 00:59:57,726
I'm here to realize that.

361
00:59:57,827 --> 00:59:59,556
For a flower shop?

362
01:00:01,798 --> 01:00:04,028
Oh don't make me blush.

363
01:00:04,567 --> 01:00:07,092
Open my own shop someday

364
01:00:08,905 --> 01:00:11,567
and fill it with my favorite flowers.

365
01:00:12,408 --> 01:00:16,504
Have all kinds of flowers
in people's homes.

366
01:00:18,548 --> 01:00:20,140
That'll be great

367
01:00:21,918 --> 01:00:25,354
To realize that, I can bear anything.

368
01:00:25,722 --> 01:00:27,189
Why a flower shop?

369
01:00:30,560 --> 01:00:33,028
Where I grew up, no flowers bloomed.

370
01:00:35,732 --> 01:00:40,260
The manager said
I could be supervisor someday.

371
01:00:42,071 --> 01:00:44,096
Hope it comes true.

372
01:00:46,142 --> 01:00:47,404
Me, too.

373
01:01:01,290 --> 01:01:02,848
You know...

374
01:01:05,161 --> 01:01:06,992
I'm just here.

375
01:01:12,068 --> 01:01:14,764
No reason to be any where else

376
01:01:15,238 --> 01:01:17,229
so I'm just here.

377
01:01:20,343 --> 01:01:22,402
Don't mind being alive

378
01:01:23,012 --> 01:01:25,742
but being dead may not be so bad.

379
01:01:29,919 --> 01:01:31,511
I don't get it.

380
01:01:32,055 --> 01:01:33,249
Guess you don't.

381
01:01:35,558 --> 01:01:37,253
You're doing great.

382
01:01:40,229 --> 01:01:41,594
Oh, c'mon.

383
01:03:18,594 --> 01:03:24,396
TO MISS LAUNDRY SERVICE.
SORRY IT'S LATE. HAPPY BIRTHDAY.
