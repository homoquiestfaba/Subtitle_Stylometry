1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,100
OK, everybody ready!
Quiet on the set.

2
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:07,400
- Roll sound.
- Rolling.

3
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:10,100
- Camera.
- Rolling.

4
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:14,700
Action!

5
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:17,300
Action! Action!

6
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:20,800
- Can I start?
- Get on with it!

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,600
No, I am not Byron, I am some other

8
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:28,000
Elect who yet remains unknown

9
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:30,700
A pilgrim, though with a Russian soul

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,100
Like him I am driven through the world in pother

11
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:36,700
I set out early, I'll pass away sooner

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,100
My mind will not achieve a lot.

13
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:53,100
- Where do I get a pass?
- Over there. - Thank you.

14
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:02,500
Sergei BODROV

15
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:07,700
- It's OK.
- Which way is it?

16
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,900
Take the main elevator to
the eighth floor. You have to ask there.

17
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,000
Thank you.
You're welcome.

18
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:21,300
Victor SUKHORUKOV

19
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:37,800
Sergei MAKOVETSKY

20
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,400
Hello.

21
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:51,100
Hello.

22
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:57,000
Gary HOUSTON

23
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,900
Darya LESNlKOVA

24
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:18,800
Excuse me, where's Studio 10?

25
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,600
Boris, it's OK.

26
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,700
- Which one?
- Studio 10. Channel 6.

27
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:27,900
Go straight down the corridor
to the elevators.

28
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:31,400
Then go up one floor.
Say hi to Vanya Demidov.

29
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,600
From whom?

30
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,600
- What's your name, handsome?
- Danila.

31
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:47,400
- Who was that?
- Saltykova.

32
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,700
- I didn't catch the name.
- Boris.

33
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:52,700
- Hers.
- Irina.

34
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:57,100
Irina SALTYKOVA

35
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,300
Ilya has looked for you downstairs
3 times already.

36
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:01,800
Where the hell have you been?

37
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:10,200
Guys, we go live in one minute.
Come on.

38
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:13,900
Did the soldiers from Chechnya
arrive or not?

39
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,700
It's OK, Vanya.

40
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:22,300
Kirill PlROGOV

41
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,900
Quiet on the set.
30 seconds to go.

42
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,100
- Did you host 'Music Review' show?
- I used to.

43
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,900
So you are Kostya Gromov
and you've got several medals of honor.

44
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:39,900
you're Danila Bagrov,
and that makes you Ilya Setevoi.

45
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:42,300
Great. Take the sweater off.

46
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:46,600
Don't interrupt me. We're ready.

47
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:52,700
- Who's Irina Saltykova?
- What? She's a pop star!

48
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:01,900
Good evening. You're watching
The World of People.

49
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:05,500
In 1996, in Chechnya,
Sergeant Kostya Gromov

50
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:10,200
was decorated for bravery,
but he didn't know about it.

51
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:13,700
Now he has got his medal.
Here is Kostya Gromov

52
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,500
and his comrades-in-arms
Danila Bagrov and Ilya Setevoi.

53
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:21,300
Dmitry Gromov,
a famous Russian hockey player

54
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:26,700
now in the NHL
is Kostya's twin brother.

55
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:31,800
- What were you honored for?
- It was a covert operation...

56
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,900
Alexander DIACHENKO

57
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:39,500
When I came round,
I saw the Big Guy...

58
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:42,200
- Who's the Big Guy?
- It's Kostya.

59
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:46,100
So the Big Guy was dragging
the two of us with his left hand.

60
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:49,300
And he had a machine gun
and a Kalashnikov in his right hand

61
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:53,500
Blood was streaming out of me,
my hip was busted. I could see

62
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:59,100
the Kalashnikov bouncing around,
bumping against Danila's head.

63
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:02,100
I thought he was lucky
to have his helmet on.

64
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:07,200
Other guys didn't make it.
Here's a photograph.

65
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:16,400
- We're at a rest point.
- It's summer already.

66
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,100
Which one of you is the toughest?

67
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:20,100
Danila.

68
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:26,700
He was very smart
and never feared anything.

69
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,400
Hi. Turn on Channel 6.

70
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,200
Check out the boy
with the full lips.

71
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,900
I'll call you back later.

72
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:40,100
Ray TOLER

73
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:43,100
Now I am a security guard
in a bank.

74
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:45,800
A major one.
It's the Nikolaevsky Bank.

75
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,900
I like it there.
The guys are all athletes.

76
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,000
I'm actually from Kiev.

77
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:57,300
After school I went to my Dad in Tula
and soon I was recruited

78
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:01,900
And Ilya here works on
the Red Square.

79
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:07,200
It's the former Lenin Museum.
I catalogue their archives.

80
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:11,300
They still have index cards.
I also work as a night guard there.

81
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:14,200
That's how I bumped into Danila.
I went out one morning

82
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:17,500
and he was standing there,
looking at the Mausoleum.

83
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:21,100
What do you want to be?

84
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:24,900
Well, I want to enter
an institute.

85
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:28,600
- Which one?
- A medical school. I want to heal people.

86
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,900
Really? That's symbolic...

87
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,600
Look!

88
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,700
Your brother's in Moscow.
They show him on TV.

89
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:44,100
And you sit here drinking vodka,
you pig.

90
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,500
You'd better help your mother.

91
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,600
I'm going to die soon.

92
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:55,300
You'll be fine, Ma.

93
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:58,500
You should go to your brother
in Moscow.

94
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:02,000
He'd help you out,
you fool.

95
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:10,300
He's your brother, after all.
Screw him...

96
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:20,200
BROTHER - 2

97
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:27,100
This message is for subscriber 712515.

98
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:34,200
Irina, please call me on
7641232.

99
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,100
It's Danila. You showed me
the way to Channel 6.

100
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:42,300
Regards from Demidov.
I'll be waiting.

101
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:45,100
- Who's that?
- Saltykova.

102
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:48,400
- Where did you get the number?
- From Demidov.

103
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:53,500
Warrant officer, get us
some more cold beer.

104
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:57,700
Mitya was with the Kiev Falcons
for 2 years.

105
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:03,100
Then he was drafted by the NHL to play
for the Chicago Black Hawks. Cool!

106
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:06,400
Can you imagine? Your brother's
going to America to play hockey!

107
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,200
But the Kiev mob
got him.

108
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:11,600
They egged Chicago Ukrainians
on Mitya.

109
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:14,800
They said: "We raised you,
we gave you money,

110
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,300
now it's payback time."
Greedy bastards!

111
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:21,500
Mitya knows if you pay once,
you pay forever.

112
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:27,800
So he found some local
protection... an American.

113
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:32,900
Katya, we are talking, OK?

114
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:39,200
The American got it right.
He found some people

115
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:42,500
to represent Mitya's interests
in the NHL.

116
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:45,700
Lots of agents came with contracts
to sign.

117
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:48,600
Mitya signed them all and
the Ukrainians left him alone.

118
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:54,000
Everything was OK.
He was scoring his goals.

119
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:58,500
Not long ago the Pittsburgh
Penguins bought him.

120
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:00,600
But all the money goes to
the account of this American.

121
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:03,300
And Mitya gets peanuts.

122
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:07,100
Mitya waited and waited until
he realized he's been conned.

123
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:12,100
He goes back to the Ukrainians
but it's too late.

124
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:15,600
This American is sort of
a new Al Capone.

125
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:18,800
He even talks to Mitya through
his lawyer.

126
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,300
And Mitya is a star!

127
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:26,500
- How much does he owe Mitya?
- 900 grand, US dollars.

128
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:30,700
What about filing a lawsuit?

129
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:34,500
He signed a contract! Mitya didn't
speak English that time.

130
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:38,600
He thought the Americans are
honest unlike our lot.

131
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:43,100
- Guys we want some beer.
- Later.

132
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,800
This American has come to Moscow.

133
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,900
Mitya called me last night.

134
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,600
So what shall we do?

135
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:59,600
I'll talk to my boss. He's meeting
the American tomorrow.

136
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:03,500
Can you talk to the
American yourself? You speak English...

137
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,800
They wouldn't let me.
He's a new Al Capone.

138
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,500
What if he never gives it back?

139
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,500
I don't know...

140
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,400
I can't let my brother down!

141
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:22,600
We're twins, we have always
been together...

142
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:30,100
It's been a year since I saw him
and I miss him so much.

143
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,700
And who is this Al Capone?

144
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:43,000
Come on. He was the biggest
gangster in America!

145
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,500
It's for you.

146
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:50,000
Oh, hi!

147
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,300
Girls!

148
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:56,900
I just wanted to see you.

149
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,500
Demidov gave me your number.

150
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:04,700
No, he's not here.

151
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:12,300
Kotelnicheskaya?
Yes, I know.

152
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,900
See you.

153
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:22,800
- Where's Kotelnicheskaya?
- You said you knew.

154
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,400
Reveille! Like they say
in the army.

155
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,200
Like they said.

156
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:39,600
Hey, entrant, time to get
ready for your exams.

157
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,900
Can I make a phone call?

158
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:04,200
The boss has arrived.

159
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:09,600
Hi, Mr. Belkin, I'm Kostya,
Gromov's son, from Tula.

160
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:12,700
Yes, I remember. What is it?
Two years ago you helped my brother.

161
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:15,200
Now he plays hockey in America.

162
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,000
You asked your partner
Mr. Mennis from Chicago,

163
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,800
to look after Mitya.

164
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,100
But he conned him and took
all his money...

165
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,500
Would you, please talk to him?

166
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:28,400
If he does not listen to you,
I'll do it myself.

167
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:32,600
- What will you do?
- I'll speak to him.

168
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:36,900
- To whom?
- To Mr. Mennis. He's in Moscow.

169
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:40,400
OK, Kostya, I'll talk to him.

170
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:05,500
Irina, do you always
watch yourself on TV?

171
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:09,000
- Dontcha like it?
- Why, it's okay.

172
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,700
But I like bands like Nautilus
or DDT.

173
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:15,700
What are you doing here then?
Get out. I am pressed for time.

174
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:19,900
Come on, don't get mad with me.

175
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,200
They don't listen to this kind
of music there. It's fake.

176
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:47,900
- Where?
- In the war.

177
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:51,200
What war? There's no war here.
And the rules are different.

178
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:54,300
This is my kind of music

179
00:13:57,200 --> 00:14:00,700
I really like you. And the music's got
nothing to do with it.

180
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:25,600
Boris, have you got
a payphone token coin?

181
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:34,700
Kostya? How did it go?

182
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:39,200
We'll party in the Metropol.

183
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:42,400
My boss promised to talk to him.

184
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,600
Pick me up at 6.
Over and out!

185
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:50,200
How is it going, officer on duty?

186
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
You haven't been with us
for a long time, Valentin.

187
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:02,700
Progress, Richard.
Fax, e-mail, lnternet.

188
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:08,200
But you came to Moscow
to appreciate the beauty of our capital.

189
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:21,500
Kate, get us some mint tea please.

190
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:27,900
I came, Valentin,
because your offer is very serious.

191
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:36,100
You're right. A federal law was passed
allowing gambling in lndian reservations.

192
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:42,700
It's illegal for foreign companies
to buy land there.

193
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:47,200
That's why I addressed to you.
I know you talent for evading the law.

194
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:53,500
- Mr.Belkin, the tea's ready.
- Bring it, please.

195
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:22,000
We are talking about
large sums of money.

196
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:24,400
Sums I know you don't have.

197
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:28,900
That's true.
But I have very serious partners

198
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:32,400
whose names I can't tell even you.

199
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:37,600
The main thing is that everything
will go through me.

200
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:47,100
Now I would like to know
your ideas on technicalities.

201
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:52,700
He's busy at the moment,
I'll tell him. Good bye.

202
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,500
It's very good.

203
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:13,200
Two years ago I asked you to help
a Russian hockey player in Chicago?

204
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:17,100
He had some difficulties
with the Ukrainian Mafia.

205
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:21,400
If you asked, Valentin,
everything is all right.

206
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:24,200
We are getting involved
in a big operation.

207
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:27,900
You are interested in diamonds
I am interested in the NHL.

208
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,300
It should not concern
our new agreement.

209
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:36,400
We should be looking out
for each other.

210
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:44,000
I'll pick you up
at the "Metropol" hotel at 6.

211
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,100
Take Mr.Mennis to the hotel.

212
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:56,900
Get me Chief of security!
Quickly!

213
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:06,000
Still asleep? It's already
5 o'clock!

214
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:12,300
You pick up Kostya,
I'll come at 7.

215
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:18,600
- OK?
- OK. Over and out.

216
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,900
Brake with your legs, not with
your head, shitass.

217
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:05,200
There are too many freaks. They buy
cars and driving licenses

218
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:08,200
but they can't actually drive.

219
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:11,300
Where are you going?

220
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,700
You asshole!

221
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,900
You should be driving a road-roller.
Where do they get their money?

222
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:22,200
They probably buy it as well!

223
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:25,200
A country of sheep and goats!

224
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:28,000
You vote for a thin guy, and
in a year you're watching

225
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:34,500
some arse-faced hog on TV
who tells you how to live.

226
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:38,500
- Where?
- Turn right behind that building.

227
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:41,400
That's the Taganka Theater!
Behind that building indeed.

228
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:46,000
There were fewer halfwits
in my generation.

229
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:51,200
Can't you tell red from green,
you cow?

230
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:55,000
Green means 'go', red means 'stop'!

231
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,800
They used to be sensible people

232
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:02,800
and suddenly they all turned
into cretins. Paradox.

233
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:07,800
Sound the horn.

234
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,700
That's not a boat...
That'll be 66 rubles.

235
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:23,400
- Wait a minute, I'll get my friend.
- Even women never wait for such morons.

236
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,300
Police.

237
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:21,800
It's a murder. 7 Khokhlovsky Lane,
apartment 4.

238
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:24,900
It's Konstantin Gromov.

239
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,700
Found by Danila Bagrov.
Waiting.

240
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,800
Ilya, Kostya's been killed.

241
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:55,900
Don't call on his cellular phone.
Wait at the museum.

242
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:57,000
Chief, put
the beds down.

243
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:33,700
Gimme a cigarette.

244
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:48,200
Hey, blockhead, gimme a light.

245
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:53,900
You deaf, shithead?
You hear what the guv said?

246
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:23,500
So, you were planning to enter
an institute.

247
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:26,000
You came to check out
the access courses.

248
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:31,100
And you didn't know
about the registration? Right?

249
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:33,700
Can't you read it?

250
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:40,900
I can hold you for another
three days.

251
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:42,500
Do you really want it?

252
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:47,900
- Why did you beat them up?
- They asked for it. I want my Discman back.

253
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:54,100
Nikolaevsky Bank. Founders:
Belkin Valentin Edgarovich.

254
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:58,200
Child: Belkin Fedya.
Studies at Nikolaevsky School.

255
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,400
We need guns.

256
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:17,900
Hello, Fascist. It's Ilya.

257
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,400
We need trophies of war.

258
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,300
OK.

259
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:50,900
- Heil Hitler.
- Hi.

260
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,300
- Who's he?
- One of our own.

261
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:56,300
A brother to your own,
for better or for worse.'

262
00:26:57,700 --> 00:27:00,400
It's a popular fascist saying.

263
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:04,500
- I'm Fascist.
- Danila.

264
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:07,900
- Are you German?
- Russian.

265
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,900
- Actually my Granddad was killed in the war.
- It happens.

266
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:29,800
What can I offer you, gentlemen?
Five MPs -

267
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:33,300
four 40s, and a 38.

268
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:37,200
Everything is checked.
With full ammunition.

269
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:41,700
Here are anti-personnel
fragmentation grenades.

270
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:46,300
They sometimes misfire.
It's a 50-50 chance.

271
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:49,700
Panzerfausts with two rounds.
Sorry, not checked.

272
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:55,400
Here are the handguns: four Walthers,
one Parabellum.

273
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:03,300
It's imported stuff.
As for domestic products

274
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:07,400
there's a Degtyarev machine-gun.
It was hardly ever used.

275
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:12,300
Four PPS's - they're heavy,
but reliable.

276
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:16,200
There's one Tula Tokarev or TT.

277
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:18,500
They get snapped up
very quickly.

278
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:21,500
There's one Nagan
but it's not very reliable.

279
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:25,700
The firing pin's worn down.

280
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:29,000
I don't suppose you'd be
interested in Mosin rifles.

281
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,200
Where does all this come from?

282
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:38,500
It's the echo of the war.

283
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:53,700
- Where are we going?
- To Moscow.

284
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:57,900
Hey, Dan, he's still there.

285
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:09,500
Brother.

286
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:16,200
...then I went to the Nikolaevsky Bank

287
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:21,200
and asked for Kostya Gromov.
Mum gave me the address.

288
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:25,300
Some jerk of a guard said:
"No one of this name works here".

289
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:31,000
So, I thought if there's nobody
at the museum...

290
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,600
I've got no money and the cops check
my passport on every corner.

291
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:38,700
Lucky I've got my police
pants on.

292
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:44,200
Wow! Is it real?

293
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:52,300
It belonged to Chapayev.

294
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:57,100
- Those were the days!
- Will you go to America with me?

295
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:59,200
Anywhere you say.

296
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,500
We need passports and visas,

297
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:05,000
and a good car for a few hours.

298
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:09,000
Brother, will you help me?

299
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:31,200
Give me a light.

300
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:34,000
You ever get any sleep?

301
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:37,300
My boss is always on the move
doing things.

302
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:40,300
He's got a cool car.
Is it German?

303
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:46,400
- Whom do you want to see?
- Fedya Belkin.

304
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:50,200
- He's already arrived.
- I'm his brother. I'm late.

305
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:53,300
That's OK, they haven't started yet.

306
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:58,700
- You can leave it here.
- I've got a present there.

307
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:28,700
This concert is dedicated to
the Students' Day.

308
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:31,900
Meet Fedya Belkin.

309
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:36,400
He will recite the Student's
poem!

310
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:51,800
I discovered that I've got
Relatives, and they're my lot.

311
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:56,900
They are woods that are so dear
Fields of corn and every ear,

312
00:33:57,100 --> 00:34:02,500
Streams of water, skies of blue.
I shall tell them: "l love you".

313
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:07,200
It's the Homeland of mine
I shall love it all the time!

314
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:24,500
Hi, Fedya!

315
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,900
The poem... You recited it
very well...

316
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:30,600
I'm your new Russian teacher,
Danila Sergeyevich...

317
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:42,900
Valentin Edgarovich.
I'm Fedya's Russian teacher.

318
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:47,900
I need to talk to you.
Let's go into the teachers' room.

319
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:50,200
You go to the conference hall.

320
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:58,100
- Who's he?
- Our new Russian teacher.

321
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:04,800
Goodbye, America,

322
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:09,100
Where I have never been,

323
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:15,400
Farewell forever...

324
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:19,400
Keep your hands on the table.
That's good..

325
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:24,100
I pull on the trigger,
your balls fall down.

326
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:29,500
Frightened? Were you frightened
when you killed Kostya?

327
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:32,900
Kostya?

328
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:34,700
Yes, Gromov.

329
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:38,900
It wasn't me. It was
the American.

330
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:43,900
It was him. I couldn't.
I know his father.

331
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:49,000
I promised Kostya. I didn't think
he'd refuse. He's greedy.

332
00:35:49,100 --> 00:35:52,500
Tell me everything about
the American. Now!

333
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:56,300
Sorry, I'm talking
with a sponsor.

334
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:59,100
A few more minutes

335
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:06,400
Still talking?

336
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:11,500
He's a big shot in lllinois.

337
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:14,600
He financed the mayor's
election campaign.

338
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:19,300
He's got congressmen in his pocket.
He deals in drugs,

339
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:22,700
owns a string of blues and
rock clubs in Chicago.

340
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:25,500
He launders his money
in them.

341
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,500
His headquarters are
in the Metro club.

342
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:31,300
He deals in land and
real estate.

343
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:36,400
He does any business promising
money, like NHL...

344
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:40,300
He orders films in Russia
with real rapes and murders

345
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:42,200
and sells them over there.
He's very greedy.

346
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:46,700
He'll kill you for 100 bucks.
And he conned Kostya's brother.

347
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:51,900
l...l didn't do it.

348
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:57,500
A million is no big deal for him.
He's got...

349
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:04,100
Don't shoot. You're
a reasonable man.

350
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:09,600
All right, live on, scum.
Thank your son.

351
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:13,100
lt'd be a shame to leave such
a nice kid without a father.

352
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:16,200
Sit quiet and let
your pants dry out.

353
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:31,300
Don't bother him. He's writing
an application for the school board.

354
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:38,800
You should see a doctor.
Prostatitis is a mean thing.

355
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:41,900
You won't get a hard on
and that's all.

356
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:58,100
Give me a break!

357
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:06,000
Why did you kill him, you oaf?!

358
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:07,800
You told me yourself:

359
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:12,300
he doesn't mind his own business
and you don't want to see him around.

360
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,500
Shitass!

361
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:21,900
And Ilya, he works on
the Red Square.

362
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:26,100
It's the former Lenin Museum.
I catalogue their archives.

363
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:30,200
I also work as a night guard there.

364
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:34,500
- That's how I bumped into Danila.
- To the museum, fast!

365
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:40,200
Got to get a new car.
There's too much heat.

366
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:44,700
- I changed the plates.
- That thug at the school memorized them.

367
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:48,400
- I'll change them again.
- When will passports be ready?

368
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:51,900
Tomorrow or the day after.
It's not easy.

369
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:58,000
Yes... He's dead.

370
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:05,400
Here's the money. Nothing more left.

371
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:10,200
As soon as you get the passports
buy two tickets to Chicago.

372
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:12,500
We need to scram.

373
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:15,200
Sooner or later they'll check out
the museum. And the apartments.

374
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:18,900
- They won't find yours.
- The cops have got my address.

375
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:21,900
Let's go.

376
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:33,500
Let's take this one too.
It's a beauty.

377
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:45,000
This message is for subscriber 712515.

378
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:50,500
Irina, call me immediately.
Danila.

379
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:00,900
I told you there's too much heat.

380
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:04,400
Sit quiet, it's OK.

381
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:13,000
Your driving license
and car papers.

382
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:17,900
Hello.

383
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:21,900
She can't speak right now.
They are shooting a new video.

384
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:27,600
- Is it a decade pass?
- Hang on...

385
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:36,500
Yes, it is. I'll come over.

386
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:39,500
Where is it?

387
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:44,700
We're going to the TV center.

388
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,800
- Have a safe trip.
- Goodbye.

389
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:51,600
Wow!

390
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:57,600
Relax. My papers... are
in order.

391
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:06,000
Don't worry, pops.
We're friends of Ilya's.

392
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:10,900
We'll just take a look at
the exhibition.

393
00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:20,300
They left an hour ago.

394
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:24,700
Three of them. They took
some kind of a box.

395
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:30,700
The old guy doesn't remember
a fucking thing.

396
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:35,900
Lay an ambush. Start looking for
a white Volvo.

397
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:39,500
Call the traffic police.
They could change registration plates.

398
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:44,800
Check out the airlines:
The name is Bagrov, flying to Chicago.

399
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:48,100
Guys from Aeroflot will tell me, of course,

400
00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:51,500
but other airlines never give out such info.

401
00:41:51,700 --> 00:41:55,300
Get a Duma deputy's card
or a security service lD.

402
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:57,600
Do I have to spell it out
for you?

403
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,000
Okay.

404
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:25,000
Cut.

405
00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:27,900
That was no good. 25 frames
& the whole track.

406
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:30,400
Once again!

407
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:41,500
- How long's it been going on?
- For the third day, already.

408
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:46,600
- It's a hard job...
- But not the worst one.

409
00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:52,300
- Where did you serve?
- In the paratroopers.

410
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:58,700
- Did you see any action?
- I had a crack at the Afghans.

411
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:06,600
Listen, is there... anything
going on between you and Irina?

412
00:43:10,700 --> 00:43:13,200
It's just... well,
I really like her.

413
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:18,700
But she sings all that crap.

414
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:23,000
It's no Nautilus or DDT.

415
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:25,200
Maybe you should become
a music producer?

416
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:29,300
Maybe I will. But I've got
no ear for it.

417
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:36,500
Another four hours.
I thought we'd finish sooner,

418
00:43:36,700 --> 00:43:41,200
Can I wait for you at home?
Boris, give him the key... or a lift.

419
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:44,000
It's OK, I've got a car.
Shall I buy anything?

420
00:43:54,100 --> 00:43:56,000
I'll call you when I wake up.

421
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:20,300
Hey, buddy, was that
Irina Saltykova?

422
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:23,300
Does she live here?

423
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:27,700
Listen, buddy, whose banger
is it?

424
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,100
No idea. I am a stranger here.

425
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:36,100
Have you seen this guy
around here?

426
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:40,800
Nope.

427
00:44:42,500 --> 00:44:45,600
Saltykova's cool.
You screwing her?

428
00:44:58,900 --> 00:45:02,800
There are some guys hanging out
at the Volvo.

429
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:07,300
- Serious guys. They've got your photo.
- Cops?

430
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:09,800
- Don't look like them.
- How many?

431
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:13,000
Two by the car.
Some more in the jeep.

432
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:16,900
I can't see. The windows are tainted.
One by the doorway.

433
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:21,300
- Thanks, Boris.
- Keep Irina out of it.

434
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:39,800
Tired?

435
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:45,800
I'm not alone. My brother
Victor's here.

436
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:48,000
He was like a father to me.

437
00:45:49,300 --> 00:45:51,000
- Victor Bagrov.
- Irina.

438
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:52,600
Pleased to meet you.

439
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:56,000
I don't like Kirkorov,

440
00:45:56,100 --> 00:46:01,400
He's too sweet. All that
make-up. Powdered, like a woman.

441
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:04,300
What would you say? A Romanian.

442
00:46:05,600 --> 00:46:08,700
- But he's Bulgarian.
- Is he? Any difference?

443
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:16,900
Where are you, Ilya?

444
00:46:17,300 --> 00:46:19,900
The address is 2 Sadovaya
Triumphalnaya.

445
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:23,300
The passports are ready.
The flight's tomorrow morning.

446
00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:30,700
Move! There's a jeep downstairs
and four fighters.

447
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:33,800
You'll run to the car
and open a door for me.

448
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:43,300
- Ready?
- Yeah.

449
00:46:53,100 --> 00:46:56,900
What are you doing here?
Hit the ground!

450
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:01,500
My regards to Belkin.

451
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:09,600
That's the first misfire.
Where are we going?

452
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:11,500
I'll drive.

453
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:20,400
2 men. A tommy-gun and grenades.
Shiryay's been hit. The plate number ofVolvo is...

454
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:23,100
Get Semyon on the case.

455
00:47:28,500 --> 00:47:30,200
Don't let them slip away!

456
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:36,500
He came to the school with this Bald one.
Sava identified him.

457
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:42,300
He's clean with the cops.
We're checking his Mafia links.

458
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:50,000
A ticket for an Aeroflot flight to Chicago
was booked and purchased.

459
00:47:50,100 --> 00:47:53,900
The name is Bagrov. Departs on the 22nd.

460
00:47:56,700 --> 00:47:58,400
What date is it today?

461
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:02,500
ldiot!

462
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:09,800
Yes, Belkin speaking.
Hello, Valentin Edgarovich.

463
00:48:10,100 --> 00:48:12,100
We've transferred the first
installment of money

464
00:48:12,200 --> 00:48:14,900
to your account according
to the new plan...

465
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:18,100
Your partner will receive it
in time.

466
00:48:18,900 --> 00:48:20,700
Good, Konstantin Alexeyevich.

467
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:24,300
Is everything OK?
Yes, thank you.

468
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:27,300
We hear you're having
problems...

469
00:48:27,800 --> 00:48:31,300
I solve my problems myself.

470
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,500
- Goodbye.
- All the best.

471
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:34,900
We can't lose them, brother.

472
00:49:35,900 --> 00:49:37,700
We'll make it.

473
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:49,800
Dan, turn off to some quiet place
and brake when I tell you.

474
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:19,400
Fascist wasn't kidding.

475
00:51:46,100 --> 00:51:47,300
That's for you.

476
00:51:48,300 --> 00:51:52,900
Flight to Chicago departs at 9:10 a. m.

477
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,400
You fly to New York
two hours later.

478
00:51:56,600 --> 00:51:59,400
Don't argue. lt'll be better
that way.

479
00:51:59,600 --> 00:52:02,100
You buy a car for $500
on Brighton Beach

480
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:04,600
and in 12 hours you're
in Chicago.

481
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:08,900
You return four days later.

482
00:52:09,700 --> 00:52:11,300
Why so quick?

483
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:14,800
You meet here.

484
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:22,400
That's Lake Michigan,
the fourth bridge.

485
00:52:28,600 --> 00:52:31,300
There's a bench there.

486
00:52:31,700 --> 00:52:36,300
I hooked up Kostya's cellular phone
to the roaming system.

487
00:52:37,500 --> 00:52:40,700
Take this. Use it
if you have to.

488
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:44,800
Some 250-300 dollars
are left on it. The pin-code is 3232.

489
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:52,100
Victor Bagrov, you're going to
the conference

490
00:52:52,200 --> 00:52:54,600
on new computer technologies
and software protection.

491
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:57,500
Danila Bagrov, I don't know
the purpose of your visit yet.

492
00:52:57,700 --> 00:53:00,200
I'll have to roam around lnternet
a couple more hours.

493
00:53:05,800 --> 00:53:06,900
Is it the real thing?

494
00:53:08,200 --> 00:53:09,600
Well...almost.

495
00:53:11,500 --> 00:53:13,800
While passing passport control

496
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,600
look confident and smile.

497
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,600
They like it. That's about all.

498
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:27,700
- Well, see you there, brother.
- Freedom to Angela Davis!

499
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:53,500
It's been a long time since
I kissed in an entrance hall.

500
00:54:07,900 --> 00:54:09,500
- Have you ever been to America?
- Yes.

501
00:54:09,800 --> 00:54:11,600
- What's it like?
- Nothing special.

502
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:14,700
I've never been abroad.

503
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:18,200
You haven't missed much.
Why did you bring me here?

504
00:54:21,100 --> 00:54:23,400
- It's beautiful.
- Let's go to my place.

505
00:54:24,600 --> 00:54:27,500
My train leaves in an hour.
Call me, OK?

506
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:32,500
- Are you going to America?
- Of course not. To Tula.

507
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:35,100
You can dial without long-distance codes.
Just like in Moscow.

508
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:37,400
It's a special phone.
With roaming.

509
00:54:37,800 --> 00:54:39,600
I know.

510
00:54:41,600 --> 00:54:43,500
Okay.

511
00:54:57,100 --> 00:55:00,400
I won't be long. Four days only.

512
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:02,900
He's dead. Let's go inside.

513
00:56:57,200 --> 00:56:58,400
- Who's dead?
- My friend.

514
00:57:00,600 --> 00:57:02,300
He wasn't there!

515
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:06,600
He couldn't have slipped
through!

516
00:57:10,500 --> 00:57:15,100
Boss, we checked everything.

517
00:57:15,700 --> 00:57:18,900
- Has Bagrov checked in?
- Yes.

518
00:57:19,800 --> 00:57:22,000
- Did all passengers board the plane?
- Yes.

519
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:24,900
What are you taking me for?
Who is flying to Chicago?

520
00:57:30,800 --> 00:57:33,100
Could I have another glass
of juice?

521
00:57:57,600 --> 00:58:03,400
Right, guys, this is
Danila Bagrov.

522
00:58:03,500 --> 00:58:07,000
We have to meet him at the airport
& get rid of him. Nice and quiet.

523
00:58:07,200 --> 00:58:10,700
Some good people asked us to help
the Muscovites out.

524
00:58:15,100 --> 00:58:18,000
Now we shall fill in entrance forms.

525
00:58:18,300 --> 00:58:21,300
All the necessary information

526
00:58:21,600 --> 00:58:23,800
can be found in your entry visa.

527
00:58:29,100 --> 00:58:32,300
- What is the purpose of your visit
to the United States? - What?

528
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:36,700
- Do you speak English?
- No...l don't understand.

529
00:58:39,300 --> 00:58:41,000
He's Russian.

530
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:42,700
What is the purpose of
your visit to the USA?

531
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:46,400
It's a...conference on new
computer technologies

532
00:58:46,600 --> 00:58:48,900
and software protection.

533
00:58:49,800 --> 00:58:51,500
How long will you stay
in the USA?

534
00:58:51,700 --> 00:58:54,900
Four days. It's written there.

535
00:58:55,100 --> 00:58:57,300
Here's the return ticket.

536
00:58:57,600 --> 00:58:59,500
- Where will you be staying?
- In a hotel.

537
00:58:59,800 --> 00:59:02,900
It's written in the invitation.

538
00:59:03,600 --> 00:59:06,900
- Welcome to the United States.
- Thank you very much.

539
00:59:07,900 --> 00:59:09,500
Morons...

540
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:22,100
- Have you got lard or apples?
- Why?

541
00:59:24,300 --> 00:59:27,700
Do you have any food?
Apples? Pork lard?

542
00:59:28,500 --> 00:59:30,200
Don't they sell it here?

543
00:59:31,100 --> 00:59:33,200
You don't understand.
This is quarantine!

544
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:36,400
You feeling bad?

545
00:59:54,900 --> 00:59:57,900
- Hey, how do I get downtown?
- By taxi.

546
00:59:59,600 --> 01:00:01,800
Hey, fellow countryman, where
do the Russians live here?

547
01:00:02,200 --> 01:00:03,600
Russians aren't my countrymen.

548
01:00:06,600 --> 01:00:08,500
- You a Nazi collaborator?
- What?!

549
01:00:08,800 --> 01:00:10,400
Okay, guys, see you around!

550
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:19,700
Mister Mennis, it's Moscow on line 1.

551
01:00:20,900 --> 01:00:22,900
Valentin, how are things?

552
01:00:23,400 --> 01:00:26,000
I'd like to congratulate you.
Your partners are serious people.

553
01:00:26,500 --> 01:00:29,700
I received the first installment of money.
Everything goes according to our plan.

554
01:00:30,200 --> 01:00:32,400
Tomorrow I'll meet with some people.

555
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:35,100
And we'll discuss all the technicalities.

556
01:00:35,400 --> 01:00:39,900
Everything OK with you?
Yes, everything's fine with me.

557
01:00:42,600 --> 01:00:44,100
But you have got problems.

558
01:00:48,200 --> 01:00:51,100
The Ukrainians say
he wasn't on the plane.

559
01:00:51,400 --> 01:00:54,900
Just like I told you.
We checked the Bald one with the mob.

560
01:00:56,300 --> 01:01:00,900
His nick is Tartar.
He's a hit man.

561
01:01:01,900 --> 01:01:03,600
Worked in St.Pete.

562
01:01:04,100 --> 01:01:07,200
Last year he bumped off some kingpins

563
01:01:07,700 --> 01:01:09,100
and disappeared.

564
01:01:10,200 --> 01:01:13,400
He was on that plane.

565
01:01:21,800 --> 01:01:25,500
So they've hired a hit man
and Bagrov stayed here.

566
01:01:29,600 --> 01:01:33,300
Reinforce my bodyguards! Keep looking
for Bagrov and that museum guy.

567
01:01:34,100 --> 01:01:36,500
Check who he was staying with
in that building

568
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:40,900
where we found the Volvo
and post a watch there.

569
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:45,900
Send the Ukrainians a picture
of this Bald one, eh... Tartar.

570
01:01:46,300 --> 01:01:48,300
They've got to find him.

571
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,900
What's the purpose for your visit
to the USA?

572
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:54,700
New York Film Festival

573
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,200
- Where?
- To Brighton Beach.

574
01:02:04,600 --> 01:02:06,300
- How much?
- 45.

575
01:02:06,700 --> 01:02:09,000
- 45 of what?
- Bucks.

576
01:02:09,700 --> 01:02:11,700
- Can you cut the price?
- I can't.

577
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:16,200
This one.

578
01:02:23,900 --> 01:02:25,100
Hello.

579
01:02:27,300 --> 01:02:29,600
- Brighton Beach.
- Stop yelling!

580
01:02:30,400 --> 01:02:32,500
Oh, I thought you didn't
speak Russian.

581
01:02:33,600 --> 01:02:37,700
Think less, use your brains.
You're not in Russia anymore.

582
01:02:39,400 --> 01:02:43,700
Those jerks are dying
to have a look!

583
01:02:44,500 --> 01:02:47,500
- What was it?
- One more jerk.

584
01:02:48,200 --> 01:02:50,600
- Meaning me?
- Who else?

585
01:02:52,100 --> 01:02:55,600
- Why the hell did you come here?
- To see how people live.

586
01:02:57,100 --> 01:03:00,000
I know your type. I've been
driving for a long time.

587
01:03:00,500 --> 01:03:06,200
First you live with your friends,
then you rent an apartment,

588
01:03:07,400 --> 01:03:10,300
and wait where the bent-up
American dream would take you.

589
01:03:11,500 --> 01:03:13,700
You're wrong. I love
my Homeland.

590
01:03:13,900 --> 01:03:19,200
A patriot! The Russian ldea!
Dostoyevsky! The Homeland!

591
01:03:20,300 --> 01:03:22,800
Where's your homeland, son?

592
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:28,500
Gorbachov sold it out to
the Americans to have some party.

593
01:03:29,200 --> 01:03:32,000
Your homeland screwed up
two wars and the Crimea.

594
01:03:32,200 --> 01:03:37,700
Sold out Russians in the Baltics
and the Serbs.

595
01:03:38,800 --> 01:03:41,900
Your homeland is wherever
your backside is warm!

596
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:46,000
You know it. That's why
you are here.

597
01:03:47,300 --> 01:03:49,400
Have you got a brother
in Moscow?

598
01:03:57,900 --> 01:04:00,800
What are you gaping at, dopey?
Get a move on.

599
01:04:57,400 --> 01:04:58,800
Meet my friend.

600
01:04:59,700 --> 01:05:01,700
- Danila.
- Kuibyshev.

601
01:05:03,600 --> 01:05:07,100
Oh, Moscow, Moscow...Russia.

602
01:05:08,700 --> 01:05:10,300
Come along then, young fellows.

603
01:05:25,500 --> 01:05:29,300
Don't pay attention
to the exterior.

604
01:05:30,300 --> 01:05:33,500
It's got an engine
that goes like my Sonya!

605
01:05:34,500 --> 01:05:37,600
- It could take you to Kiev.
- Will it make it to Chicago?

606
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:41,100
Even to San Francisco and back!

607
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:46,400
We Russians don't rip off
one another.

608
01:06:43,400 --> 01:06:44,700
Hi, where are you?

609
01:06:45,600 --> 01:06:49,600
I've got stuck near Tula.
My car's broken down!

610
01:06:51,300 --> 01:06:55,300
- How are you doing?
- Fine. Can you drop in today?

611
01:06:55,500 --> 01:06:57,800
No, not today. Call again!

612
01:07:12,200 --> 01:07:16,500
A new Russian. The name is Tartar.

613
01:07:16,600 --> 01:07:18,500
What an ugly mug! They've got
all kinds of people in Moscow.

614
01:07:18,700 --> 01:07:21,700
I saw him at the airport.

615
01:07:21,900 --> 01:07:24,100
The dog called me a Nazi collaborator.

616
01:07:24,200 --> 01:07:28,800
Post a round-the-clock
watch at the Metropol

617
01:07:29,100 --> 01:07:31,600
where the Russians hang out.
Remember that hockey guy Gromov?

618
01:07:31,800 --> 01:07:35,400
He came to us before.
They might meet up there.

619
01:07:36,200 --> 01:07:40,300
- And what about this one?
- Throw it away.

620
01:08:44,300 --> 01:08:47,900
Give me the bottle and let see some lD.

621
01:08:48,300 --> 01:08:51,000
I don't understand
a fucking word.

622
01:08:51,900 --> 01:08:55,000
You're breaking the lllinois
state law.

623
01:08:55,400 --> 01:08:58,800
You can't drink alcohol
in public. Your lD, please.

624
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:03,500
Bullshit. Everyone's doing it.
Over there by the shop.

625
01:09:03,800 --> 01:09:07,300
Their bottles are in paper bags.
I don't see them drinking.

626
01:09:07,600 --> 01:09:12,700
But you are drinking in public.
Your passport or license please.

627
01:09:12,800 --> 01:09:14,700
What is the difference?

628
01:09:15,600 --> 01:09:17,200
You are under arrest.

629
01:09:17,400 --> 01:09:19,100
- Give me my passport.
- You are under arrest.

630
01:09:19,200 --> 01:09:22,600
- Accompany me to the police car.
- Fuck you.

631
01:09:29,100 --> 01:09:32,000
- I'm a policeman.
- So am l.

632
01:09:35,400 --> 01:09:39,400
- 101 9. Officer is attacked.
- Quiet.

633
01:10:24,200 --> 01:10:28,100
- I go to Chicago.
- Chicago?

634
01:10:34,900 --> 01:10:36,600
Get in.

635
01:10:42,100 --> 01:10:44,000
Where are you from?

636
01:10:46,200 --> 01:10:51,000
I am an American. I live in America.
Where are you from?

637
01:10:52,400 --> 01:10:54,800
- I am Russian.
- Russian?

638
01:10:55,200 --> 01:10:57,700
From Moscow?

639
01:10:59,900 --> 01:11:03,100
Russia is very big.

640
01:11:04,600 --> 01:11:06,900
What's your name?
- Danila.

641
01:11:08,600 --> 01:11:13,100
I am Ben Johnson,
from Chicago, lllinois.

642
01:11:13,200 --> 01:11:15,900
Danila Bagrov, Moscow.

643
01:11:19,800 --> 01:11:22,900
I go to Chicago to see my brother.

644
01:11:24,500 --> 01:11:28,400
Your brother? What do you do?

645
01:11:29,300 --> 01:11:34,900
I am a truck driver. I drive a truck.
And you?

646
01:11:36,200 --> 01:11:39,100
I am a student of a medical school.

647
01:11:40,400 --> 01:11:44,800
A student learning to be a doctor?

648
01:11:48,500 --> 01:11:52,700
I bought a car in New York,
On Brighton Beach, for 500$.

649
01:11:53,900 --> 01:11:56,100
500$

650
01:11:58,800 --> 01:12:01,900
For that car?

651
01:12:08,100 --> 01:12:10,300
Russian music.

652
01:12:11,200 --> 01:12:13,200
It's new.

653
01:12:13,400 --> 01:12:15,000
Put it in.

654
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:19,400
Want a girl?

655
01:14:27,900 --> 01:14:31,700
Hello, boys, How are you?
A blowjob for 30 bucks.

656
01:14:31,800 --> 01:14:35,500
You pay 10 more to watch.
- No.

657
01:14:35,800 --> 01:14:38,000
Screw you bastards.

658
01:14:39,300 --> 01:14:42,900
- Wait! You're Russian?
- What do you want?

659
01:14:46,400 --> 01:14:48,300
Wait, take this.

660
01:14:53,500 --> 01:14:55,500
- What's your name?
- Marilyn.

661
01:14:56,100 --> 01:14:58,100
- And your Russian name?
- Dasha.

662
01:14:59,400 --> 01:15:00,900
I'm Danila.

663
01:15:01,300 --> 01:15:04,400
Hey, Danila, come on. Let's go.
He's calling you.

664
01:15:15,600 --> 01:15:20,200
- Like her?
-She's Russian.

665
01:15:29,300 --> 01:15:30,900
Stop! Stop!

666
01:15:31,600 --> 01:15:37,300
She's a hooker. He's a pimp.
It happens all the time. Don't get involved.

667
01:15:41,700 --> 01:15:44,100
He was at Saltykova's place.
Her neighbour saw him.

668
01:15:44,500 --> 01:15:47,500
- Saltykova?
- Irina, the singer!

669
01:15:47,600 --> 01:15:49,900
You know - 'blue eyes,
blue eyes'.

670
01:15:50,200 --> 01:15:54,300
He was with her. So, do
we beat it out of her?

671
01:15:55,800 --> 01:15:57,700
- Who?
- Saltykova.

672
01:15:59,200 --> 01:16:02,900
You are lucky I know you for 12 years
or else you'd never stay here.

673
01:16:03,400 --> 01:16:05,700
She's a star! The whole of
Moscow knows her!

674
01:16:06,600 --> 01:16:07,900
Beat it out of her'!

675
01:16:11,200 --> 01:16:13,100
Bug her.

676
01:16:13,500 --> 01:16:16,500
- We'll trace his phone call.
- Right.

677
01:17:24,200 --> 01:17:27,500
Hello, Mitya!

678
01:17:30,200 --> 01:17:32,300
It's Danila from Moscow,
Kostya's friend.

679
01:17:34,500 --> 01:17:36,300
Mitya, pick up the phone.

680
01:17:39,200 --> 01:17:41,600
I need to see you.

681
01:17:42,700 --> 01:17:46,900
I've got some important information
from Kostya.

682
01:17:49,600 --> 01:17:51,500
Mitya, it's Danila from Moscow.

683
01:17:55,600 --> 01:17:58,700
"UNTOUCHABLE TOURS"
Chicago Original Gangster Tour

684
01:17:58,900 --> 01:18:03,000
If you hear gunfire
you're getting down.

685
01:18:03,400 --> 01:18:05,600
Well, everybody, get down!

686
01:18:06,300 --> 01:18:08,500
It's the way to stay alive.

687
01:18:09,100 --> 01:18:14,800
Chicago is famous for John Dillinger
and Alphonse Capone.

688
01:18:15,100 --> 01:18:18,000
Prohibition in 1 920s.

689
01:18:36,400 --> 01:18:38,300
Oh my God.

690
01:18:39,800 --> 01:18:41,900
I'm sorry.

691
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:46,900
Are you OK?

692
01:18:47,600 --> 01:18:49,900
Can you get up?

693
01:18:51,700 --> 01:18:54,500
Can I take you somewhere?

694
01:19:00,200 --> 01:19:02,100
Get in.

695
01:19:09,400 --> 01:19:12,000
I'm really sorry.

696
01:19:12,200 --> 01:19:15,300
I don't want any trouble.
I'm in a TV show.

697
01:19:15,400 --> 01:19:17,600
I'm in a hurry.

698
01:19:20,600 --> 01:19:22,900
I am Lisa Jeffrey from TV.

699
01:19:27,400 --> 01:19:28,500
Danila.

700
01:19:28,600 --> 01:19:31,800
I'm gonna take you to the hospital.

701
01:19:33,500 --> 01:19:36,500
No hospital.

702
01:19:39,400 --> 01:19:43,100
- I should call a doctor.
- No. I'm a doctor.

703
01:19:59,200 --> 01:20:01,100
Bathroom.

704
01:20:04,600 --> 01:20:07,000
You should go to the bathroom.

705
01:20:36,800 --> 01:20:39,000
I gotta go to work.

706
01:20:39,300 --> 01:20:41,100
I can't miss the show.

707
01:20:44,800 --> 01:20:46,800
I'll be back.

708
01:21:33,900 --> 01:21:35,400
Come on.

709
01:22:37,600 --> 01:22:39,000
How are you?

710
01:22:39,400 --> 01:22:43,000
I want a Russian prostitute.

711
01:22:44,500 --> 01:22:45,900
Marilyn.

712
01:22:48,500 --> 01:22:49,900
Russian.

713
01:22:51,100 --> 01:22:52,500
Marilyn.

714
01:23:26,600 --> 01:23:29,600
Snowflake, come on.

715
01:23:43,600 --> 01:23:45,100
Where the fuck are you going?

716
01:23:45,200 --> 01:23:47,700
Don't go over there until you're told so.

717
01:23:48,100 --> 01:23:50,000
You're a piece of shit.

718
01:23:50,200 --> 01:23:52,500
Have you got money?

719
01:23:55,100 --> 01:23:58,200
Don't look over there.
Look into my eyes.

720
01:24:05,400 --> 01:24:07,700
Where the fuck do you think you're going?

721
01:24:10,900 --> 01:24:12,700
300$

722
01:24:33,700 --> 01:24:37,500
All units, APB on a white male
for assault on a police officer.

723
01:24:37,800 --> 01:24:41,800
Suspect is 5 feet 1 inch.
Presumably Russian.

724
01:24:54,700 --> 01:24:57,200
Sit right over here.

725
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:01,200
Officer will be here shortly.

726
01:25:01,800 --> 01:25:04,200
Don't try to run.

727
01:25:17,800 --> 01:25:21,900
I told you, I'm a doctor.

728
01:25:22,600 --> 01:25:26,500
I visited my friend, Dmitry Gromov.

729
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:29,000
I was walking. I'm first time in America.

730
01:25:29,200 --> 01:25:31,800
How am I supposed to know
you can't go walking anywhere?

731
01:25:32,200 --> 01:25:34,100
In Russia we can.

732
01:25:34,800 --> 01:25:39,100
I went in the metro. I saw pretty houses.
So I got off.

733
01:25:41,200 --> 01:25:45,300
At some bar they started on me.

734
01:25:45,700 --> 01:25:49,200
I didn't even go in.
I didn't understand what they were saying.

735
01:25:49,400 --> 01:25:53,800
They started pushing me,
threatening me with a knife.

736
01:25:54,100 --> 01:25:55,800
They took my money.

737
01:25:58,400 --> 01:26:01,000
Are there any pretty houses over there?

738
01:26:01,700 --> 01:26:03,000
Who brought him in?

739
01:26:03,200 --> 01:26:05,300
Black Jack. It's his place.

740
01:26:05,400 --> 01:26:08,000
He didn't bring anybody else in
from over there?

741
01:26:08,200 --> 01:26:10,100
No, just a Russian.

742
01:26:10,300 --> 01:26:13,700
He says he beat up a prostitute.
He's lying.

743
01:26:15,100 --> 01:26:16,900
You can go.

744
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:26,700
Fucking niggers.

745
01:27:02,100 --> 01:27:03,900
METRO CLUB

746
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:15,300
Sorry.

747
01:27:15,600 --> 01:27:18,500
Good evening, Mr. Mennis.

748
01:28:05,700 --> 01:28:11,100
Mitya! Pick up the phone!
It's Danila from Moscow.

749
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:15,300
Hi! I thought I'd never get you.

750
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:18,800
We have to meet up.

751
01:28:21,200 --> 01:28:22,800
It's for your sake.

752
01:28:24,400 --> 01:28:25,900
Kostya asked me to see you.

753
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:30,100
They killed him.

754
01:28:32,700 --> 01:28:34,400
No, not on the phone.

755
01:29:00,200 --> 01:29:02,300
- No use. He won't give it back!
- Don't worry about it.

756
01:29:02,400 --> 01:29:05,300
Tell me where he lives
and I'll sort it out.

757
01:29:05,500 --> 01:29:07,300
I know some magical words.

758
01:29:15,300 --> 01:29:18,300
- Come on, time to start.
- Coming, coming.

759
01:29:20,600 --> 01:29:24,100
That's Mennis' office,
I don't know his home address.

760
01:29:27,600 --> 01:29:30,700
- Listen, maybe I could...
- Brace up!

761
01:29:30,900 --> 01:29:32,900
- This is my friend from Moscow.
- Hi, I'm Darius.

762
01:29:33,100 --> 01:29:35,800
- Danila. Pleased to meet you.
- Don't interrupt his training session.

763
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:39,700
Listen, can I stay
at your place?

764
01:29:40,300 --> 01:29:42,200
Look, I've got a new girlfriend.

765
01:29:42,400 --> 01:29:45,800
She wouldn't understand it.
They have different rules here.

766
01:29:47,300 --> 01:29:49,900
- Can you lend me some money?
- How much?

767
01:29:50,200 --> 01:29:51,400
Say, 300$

768
01:29:51,800 --> 01:29:54,500
I don't carry cash.
I've got it on credit cards.

769
01:29:54,800 --> 01:29:58,400
I'll have a look,
I might have about 20 bucks.

770
01:29:59,500 --> 01:30:02,000
What's the English for "marganets"?
Manganese.

771
01:30:04,300 --> 01:30:07,000
Dmitry. Come on, let's go working.

772
01:33:21,200 --> 01:33:23,500
Who's after me, you Nazi
henchman?

773
01:33:23,700 --> 01:33:26,600
Don't kill me. It's
Kobonya the Squint Eyes.

774
01:33:26,800 --> 01:33:28,700
The Russians asked us
to kill the bald Tartar.

775
01:33:28,900 --> 01:33:31,700
- Where's Kobonya?
- The Lvov Restaurant.

776
01:33:33,600 --> 01:33:36,100
You'll pay for Sevastopol
you pigs!

777
01:34:03,800 --> 01:34:06,000
Hi.

778
01:34:07,500 --> 01:34:09,500
Yes, in Moscow.

779
01:34:10,200 --> 01:34:12,500
Now? I'm in Biriulevo.

780
01:34:13,900 --> 01:34:16,400
I'll finish the business
in a couple of days.

781
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:19,800
Call me, OK?

782
01:34:21,400 --> 01:34:23,200
Remember that night on the roof?

783
01:34:34,600 --> 01:34:36,500
He's in Biriulevo.
Who do we have there?

784
01:34:36,900 --> 01:34:39,100
Send all the boys.
Close off all the roads!

785
01:35:02,600 --> 01:35:03,900
Dasha!

786
01:35:04,700 --> 01:35:06,300
Dasha! Over here.

787
01:35:18,100 --> 01:35:20,500
What do you want? Haven't you
had enough of a beating?

788
01:35:21,300 --> 01:35:22,100
Hi.

789
01:35:23,400 --> 01:35:25,100
Quick. What do you want?

790
01:35:25,600 --> 01:35:29,900
I came for you. Russians don't desert
their own in the war. What's that?

791
01:35:30,200 --> 01:35:32,500
What? What war?
Are you insane?

792
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:36,200
Wait, I've got to buy a gun.
Help me.

793
01:35:36,900 --> 01:35:39,500
- What for?
- I need it.

794
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:42,800
- You got any dough?
- Yes.

795
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:45,500
I need an automatic pistol
with a thirty-round clip.

796
01:35:46,400 --> 01:35:48,600
Well, if you're lucky...
Two hundred bucks for me.

797
01:35:49,700 --> 01:35:51,400
Deal.

798
01:36:29,900 --> 01:36:32,000
Translate, I don't
understand English.

799
01:36:37,800 --> 01:36:41,000
- Two grand. Show him the money.
- Tell him to show me the gun.

800
01:36:41,500 --> 01:36:43,500
Show him the gun.

801
01:36:57,200 --> 01:37:00,500
Two grand for both of them
or just for one?

802
01:37:00,900 --> 01:37:02,900
For one. Show the money.

803
01:37:11,800 --> 01:37:13,300
It's dark in here.

804
01:37:34,800 --> 01:37:37,100
I told you, I've come for you.

805
01:37:52,800 --> 01:37:53,600
ldiot!

806
01:38:03,600 --> 01:38:04,600
It's all over.

807
01:38:04,900 --> 01:38:06,600
Do you know this poem?

808
01:38:06,800 --> 01:38:09,600
I discovered that I've got
Relatives, and they're my lot.

809
01:38:11,300 --> 01:38:13,800
Fuck you, snowflake.

810
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:17,200
They are woods that are so dear
Fields of corn and every ear

811
01:38:17,400 --> 01:38:20,600
I'll cut your ass.

812
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:24,900
Streams of water, skies of blue
I will tell them: "l love you".

813
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:28,700
You white shithead! I'll blow your head off!

814
01:38:28,900 --> 01:38:30,800
It's the Homeland of mine.

815
01:38:32,100 --> 01:38:33,500
I will love it all the time.

816
01:38:33,800 --> 01:38:36,100
Marilyn. Come here, you bitch!

817
01:38:47,400 --> 01:38:48,700
Is there a back way
out of here?

818
01:38:58,700 --> 01:39:01,100
Hi! What are you doing?

819
01:39:01,900 --> 01:39:03,000
I'm running!

820
01:39:09,800 --> 01:39:13,000
Mr.Belkin, we've transferred
the money.

821
01:39:14,400 --> 01:39:16,300
We're up and running,
as they say.

822
01:39:17,700 --> 01:39:20,300
Your reputation and your word
speak for themselves.

823
01:39:22,900 --> 01:39:24,600
But you've got problems.

824
01:39:25,600 --> 01:39:28,100
Like I said, I sort it out -

825
01:39:30,600 --> 01:39:35,000
You don't take chances
with this kind of money.

826
01:39:41,400 --> 01:39:43,600
What does 'how are you' mean?

827
01:39:44,400 --> 01:39:45,800
It means 'how are you'.

828
01:39:46,800 --> 01:39:50,100
- Do they really mean it?
- No, they do not.

829
01:39:50,900 --> 01:39:53,500
- Then why do they ask?
- They just ask.

830
01:39:53,800 --> 01:39:55,500
But they are dead serious
when it comes to money.

831
01:39:58,400 --> 01:39:59,500
I'm hungry.

832
01:40:02,100 --> 01:40:03,600
Look, crawfish climb out
right onto the pier

833
01:40:04,500 --> 01:40:07,300
and no one bothers
to catch them.

834
01:40:08,400 --> 01:40:12,500
- Maybe he isn't coming?
- He'll come.

835
01:40:34,700 --> 01:40:35,500
Brother...

836
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:48,400
Eight years is a long time.

837
01:40:50,100 --> 01:40:51,900
I wasn't even twenty then.

838
01:40:54,300 --> 01:40:57,500
University, Perestroika,
America, Coca-Cola.

839
01:40:59,800 --> 01:41:01,800
Got married, then got divorced.

840
01:41:04,100 --> 01:41:07,700
I worked for an escort
service in New York. I was a call girl.

841
01:41:10,500 --> 01:41:12,300
Then coke, crack.

842
01:41:13,800 --> 01:41:16,400
I went to Chicago with one
fattie. He dumped me.

843
01:41:18,900 --> 01:41:20,600
Then I got mixed up with
that black jerk.

844
01:41:21,300 --> 01:41:23,300
Oh, one shouldn't speak
ill of the dead.

845
01:41:23,900 --> 01:41:25,900
Anyway, it's all boring
and dull.

846
01:41:26,800 --> 01:41:30,600
You know it was 1 984
when I last sat at the campfire.

847
01:41:31,800 --> 01:41:33,800
We went camping at
Glukhoe Lake...

848
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:38,500
Come home with us.
It's OK there.

849
01:41:39,200 --> 01:41:42,200
- And what will I do there?
- What are you doing here?

850
01:41:45,200 --> 01:41:48,200
I like it here. America is the world's
driving power!

851
01:41:48,900 --> 01:41:53,900
- What is its power, brother?
- It's the money, brother.

852
01:41:54,500 --> 01:41:57,300
Money rules the world. Whoever
has the most is the strongest.

853
01:41:59,800 --> 01:42:03,100
Suppose, you've got a lot of money.
What would you do?

854
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:06,800
- I'd buy everyone.
- Even me?

855
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:19,000
What does he want?
Some crawfish?

856
01:42:20,100 --> 01:42:21,400
What do you want?

857
01:42:21,700 --> 01:42:23,700
Dirt. He says the food's dirty.

858
01:42:23,900 --> 01:42:26,300
Crawfish eat the dirt.
We shouldn't eat them.

859
01:42:28,100 --> 01:42:30,000
What? Dirt?

860
01:42:31,500 --> 01:42:34,400
Look at you Black scum.

861
01:42:34,600 --> 01:42:37,100
You need a good scrub! Get lost!

862
01:42:37,100 --> 01:42:39,000
Leave him. Negro, go, go!

863
01:42:39,400 --> 01:42:43,200
Who are you calling Negro?
I'll show you a real Negro.

864
01:42:43,400 --> 01:42:45,900
- You shouldn't call him a Negro.
- And who is he?

865
01:42:46,600 --> 01:42:49,100
- He's an Afro-American.
- What's the difference?

866
01:42:50,100 --> 01:42:52,200
Nigger sounds offensive to them.

867
01:42:52,500 --> 01:42:55,400
That's what I was taught at
school. The Chinese live in China,

868
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:59,600
the Germans live in Germany, the Jews
in lsrael & Negroes in Africa.

869
01:43:00,200 --> 01:43:04,900
I think the power's in them.
There's something primordial

870
01:43:05,600 --> 01:43:09,900
& brutal about these people. We lost it,
that's why they're stronger.

871
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:13,100
The whites know it and they're
afraid of them.

872
01:43:22,200 --> 01:43:25,300
- We'd better go.
- Bastards, they spoiled the party.

873
01:44:47,700 --> 01:44:50,300
What are you doing here?
- A toilet.

874
01:44:50,600 --> 01:44:52,400
Back there.

875
01:45:09,300 --> 01:45:10,300
Richard.

876
01:45:10,600 --> 01:45:15,100
Remember I asked you
about a Russian hockey player in Chicago?

877
01:45:15,500 --> 01:45:19,700
Be on the look out!
A Russian professional came to get you.

878
01:45:19,800 --> 01:45:24,500
I'll send a photograph of him to you
over lnternet.

879
01:45:24,700 --> 01:45:27,000
He's already in Chicago.

880
01:45:27,500 --> 01:45:30,800
We have to look after each other.

881
01:45:42,700 --> 01:45:45,000
- Can I help you, sir?
- Mr. Mennis's office.

882
01:45:47,700 --> 01:45:49,900
Your name, sir?

883
01:46:03,800 --> 01:46:07,100
Can I talk to Mr. Mennis?

884
01:46:12,700 --> 01:46:15,800
No, thank you.

885
01:46:20,700 --> 01:46:23,900
He's at the Metro Club
He'll be back late at night.

886
01:46:28,500 --> 01:46:30,300
Don't bother waiting.
He's cheated on you.

887
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:33,700
Something could happen to him.

888
01:46:35,000 --> 01:46:36,800
I think he's just a jerk.

889
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:39,100
He's my brother!

890
01:46:43,100 --> 01:46:44,900
OK, let's go see Mennis.

891
01:48:43,900 --> 01:48:45,900
Don't shoot.

892
01:48:50,700 --> 01:48:52,500
Where's Mennis?

893
01:48:56,600 --> 01:48:57,900
Money.

894
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:11,300
Where's Mennis?

895
01:49:12,700 --> 01:49:15,900
In Mennis's office.

896
01:49:16,200 --> 01:49:19,600
It's all in cash there.

897
01:49:57,400 --> 01:50:02,200
I discovered that I've got
Relatives and they're my lot.

898
01:50:02,600 --> 01:50:07,600
They are woods that are so dear
Fields of corn and every ear.

899
01:50:09,000 --> 01:50:13,600
Streams of water, skies of blue.
I shall tell them: "I love you!"

900
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:17,100
It's the Homeland of mine.

901
01:50:25,000 --> 01:50:27,700
...and they're my lot.

902
01:50:28,200 --> 01:50:33,500
They are woods that are so dear
Fields of corn and every ear.

903
01:50:33,900 --> 01:50:39,700
Streams of water, skies of blue.
I shall tell them: "I love you!"

904
01:50:40,100 --> 01:50:44,600
It's the Homeland of mine.
I will love it all the time.

905
01:50:55,500 --> 01:51:01,900
I discovered that I've got
Relatives and they're my lot.

906
01:51:02,300 --> 01:51:07,900
They are woods that are so dear
Fields of corn and every ear.

907
01:51:56,300 --> 01:51:59,900
- How are you?
- Thank you. I'm OK.

908
01:52:00,200 --> 01:52:02,000
That's great.

909
01:52:02,300 --> 01:52:05,800
Ah, Russian vodka! Good.

910
01:52:11,400 --> 01:52:12,300
Come on.

911
01:52:34,900 --> 01:52:39,500
American, what's your power?
Is it really money?

912
01:52:41,400 --> 01:52:43,500
My brother says it's money.

913
01:52:44,500 --> 01:52:46,400
You've got lots of money -
so what?

914
01:52:47,300 --> 01:52:51,500
Truth is a real power.
Whoever is right is strong.

915
01:52:53,000 --> 01:52:55,200
You cheated on a man
and took away his money.

916
01:52:55,700 --> 01:52:57,200
Did it make you stronger?

917
01:52:57,700 --> 01:52:59,700
No, it did not.

918
01:53:01,200 --> 01:53:03,300
Cos you are not right.

919
01:53:04,100 --> 01:53:06,400
And the person you cheated on is.

920
01:53:07,700 --> 01:53:09,100
That means he's stronger.

921
01:53:10,400 --> 01:53:11,500
Right?

922
01:53:13,100 --> 01:53:14,100
Right.

923
01:53:19,000 --> 01:53:21,700
Dmitry Gromov, gimme his money.

924
01:53:40,200 --> 01:53:42,200
So, play hockey.

925
01:53:44,200 --> 01:53:48,100
Will my money keep on going
to Mennis' account?

926
01:53:48,600 --> 01:53:50,300
Tell them to make transfers
to your account.

927
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:54,400
- What about the contract?
- Forget it.

928
01:53:58,200 --> 01:54:00,400
He did not pay me
the interest on this money.

929
01:54:06,200 --> 01:54:07,700
You are like your brother...

930
01:54:23,000 --> 01:54:25,100
Give up, Russian!

931
01:54:26,400 --> 01:54:28,000
Russians never give up!

932
01:54:41,000 --> 01:54:44,700
- Hey, what's happening here?
- Russian Mafia.

933
01:54:51,900 --> 01:54:53,100
What's going on here?

934
01:54:53,700 --> 01:54:56,300
A Russian shot down
Ukrainian Mafiosi

935
01:54:56,400 --> 01:54:59,800
last night at the Lvov
restaurant.

936
01:55:05,800 --> 01:55:08,400
I bet they'll use tear gas next.

937
01:55:08,600 --> 01:55:12,700
- How do you know?
- Don't you watch the movies?

938
01:55:14,800 --> 01:55:16,600
I'm staying!

939
01:55:18,800 --> 01:55:21,900
I'm staying here! I'm gonna
live here.

940
01:55:27,400 --> 01:55:31,000
Hello. How are you? I'm Marilyn.

941
01:55:31,300 --> 01:55:34,300
- Nice to meet you.
- It's nice to meet you.

942
01:55:35,600 --> 01:55:37,400
How can I ask for help?

943
01:55:37,800 --> 01:55:39,000
"l need help".

944
01:55:51,500 --> 01:55:55,300
Ben, It's Danila.

945
01:55:57,200 --> 01:55:59,500
Ben. I need help.

946
01:56:06,800 --> 01:56:09,000
Are you gangsters?

947
01:56:09,400 --> 01:56:11,800
No, we are Russians.

948
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:15,300
Dasha, come over here.

949
01:56:15,900 --> 01:56:16,200
All units, APB on a white male

950
01:56:18,500 --> 01:56:21,100
20-25 years old

951
01:56:21,400 --> 01:56:25,800
6 feet, dressed in a black coat,
jeans and military boots.

952
01:56:26,200 --> 01:56:28,800
A Russian. Doesn't speak English.
He's armed.

953
01:56:29,100 --> 01:56:31,700
He's with a white female. Tall, shaved head.

954
01:56:32,000 --> 01:56:36,400
The name is Marilyn. Russian.
English speaking.

955
01:56:39,400 --> 01:56:44,300
Quickly! First class, flight 330.
Yes, sir.

956
01:56:53,000 --> 01:56:55,000
Quick!

957
01:57:11,500 --> 01:57:15,000
The check-in is over.
Where's the second passenger?

958
01:57:21,700 --> 01:57:25,000
- Hey, thanks.
- Thank you.

959
01:57:31,100 --> 01:57:36,600
Please do not close the gate.
Flight 330.

960
01:57:36,800 --> 01:57:41,100
2 passengers from the first class
are running for the plane.

961
01:57:57,000 --> 01:57:59,700
Your visa expired years ago.

962
01:57:59,900 --> 01:58:02,400
You've broken the immigration laws.

963
01:58:02,500 --> 01:58:06,300
You won't be able
to return to the United States.

964
01:58:16,400 --> 01:58:21,900
Hi, I'll be back tomorrow.
Book a table for 4 at the Metropol.

965
01:58:23,100 --> 01:58:24,400
Hey, boy.

966
01:58:24,800 --> 01:58:27,400
Tell Boris I'm bringing him
a present.

967
01:58:27,500 --> 01:58:29,100
Get us some vodka.

968
01:58:29,400 --> 01:58:32,700
Sorry, we don't serve drinks
during the take-off.

969
01:58:34,900 --> 01:58:36,600
Boy, you don't understand.

970
01:58:37,100 --> 01:58:39,300
Bring us some vodka.

971
01:58:40,400 --> 01:58:42,100
We're going home.

972
01:58:42,700 --> 01:58:45,100
Oh, I see. I'll be right back.
