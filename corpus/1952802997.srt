00:00:49,299 --> 00:00:51,633
Citizens of Metrocity,

2
00:00:51,801 --> 00:00:56,013
long have I waited
to give you your just desserts.

3
00:00:56,181 --> 00:00:59,641
Prepare to face
the unbridled wrath of...

4
00:00:59,809 --> 00:01:01,727
...my fantastic bargains!

5
00:01:03,396 --> 00:01:07,066
Welcome, welcome,
citizens of Metrocity,

6
00:01:07,233 --> 00:01:09,485
to the Evil Lair Yard Sale.

7
00:01:09,652 --> 00:01:13,614
As you know, this is my first day
as defender of Metrocity,

8
00:01:13,782 --> 00:01:18,494
and now that I'm no longer evil ,
I no longer need things that do evil .

9
00:01:18,995 --> 00:01:22,998
- A Terror Teddy, awesome.
- Excellent choice.

10
00:01:23,166 --> 00:01:25,751
Now, let the browsing com mence.

11
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:29,338
Minion , we're going
to need more petty cash .

12
00:01:30,173 --> 00:01:33,217
- What's behind there, Minion?
- Nothing .

13
00:01:33,676 --> 00:01:35,928
- I knew it.
- Please, please, please.

14
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:37,930
Can't we just keep the spider-bot?

15
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:42,476
Minion , heroes don't drive around
in creepy spee-ider-bots.

16
00:01:42,644 --> 00:01:44,853
See? Now you've hurt its feelings.

17
00:01:45,021 --> 00:01:46,730
Spider-bot, come here.

18
00:01:47,524 --> 00:01:50,317
Damien, we do not play with laser guns.

19
00:01:50,485 --> 00:01:52,820
- Come on , Mom .
- Put it back this instant.

20
00:01:52,987 --> 00:01:55,322
Madame, he's merely expressing himself.

21
00:01:58,201 --> 00:02:01,203
Besides, it's not a laser gun .
lt's a dehydration . . .

22
00:02:03,206 --> 00:02:04,623
. . .gun .

23
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:08,710
Just soak her in some water,
not the toilet. She'll be fine.

24
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:10,712
- That is so cool .
- Yes.

25
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:13,382
Free doughnuts with every
billion-dollar purchase.

26
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:17,344
Piece of junk? This satellite death ray
goes up to 900 m illion volts,

27
00:02:17,512 --> 00:02:20,013
and has its own GPS.

28
00:02:20,181 --> 00:02:23,392
Let me handle this, Minion .
For insurance purposes,

29
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:28,230
l have to tell you to only use it
for barbecuing , not for evil .

30
00:02:28,398 --> 00:02:31,733
- I don't like barbecues.
- " I don't like barbecues."

31
00:02:31,901 --> 00:02:33,902
Shall we start the bidding?

32
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:37,656
Bootwheel of death .
Sold to the soccer mom !

33
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:40,075
Can I get seven for the flamethrower?

34
00:02:40,243 --> 00:02:42,911
Sold to the chef.
Excellent for creme brulee.

35
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:45,330
Do I hear ten bucks
for the disguise generator?

36
00:02:45,498 --> 00:02:47,666
Sold to the woman
with the beautiful m ustache.

37
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:50,252
Sold to you , sir. Sold .
Sold . Sold .

38
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:52,921
Sold .

39
00:02:53,089 --> 00:02:56,925
Fantastic.
The place is already looking less evil .

40
00:02:57,093 --> 00:03:00,637
Sir, now that we've gotten rid
of all your "evil things,"

41
00:03:00,805 --> 00:03:02,723
how are we going to protect Metro City?

42
00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:05,350
Way ahead of you , Minion .

43
00:03:08,104 --> 00:03:09,521
What are you wearing?

44
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:12,608
My new super-secret,
superhero super-suit.

45
00:03:12,775 --> 00:03:16,153
l designed it myself,
to copy all of Metro Man's powers:

46
00:03:16,321 --> 00:03:18,947
super-boots, super-strength ,

47
00:03:19,115 --> 00:03:23,035
and super-X-ray-slash-laser vision .

48
00:03:24,621 --> 00:03:28,123
Yeah , I'm not sure
if it's really. . . you .

49
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:31,543
Au contraire, filet Minion .

50
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:35,130
This is perfect for when we go
on our first patrol of the city.

51
00:03:35,298 --> 00:03:38,300
- What's that?
- It's the only thing I couldn't sell ,

52
00:03:38,468 --> 00:03:42,095
other than the death ray.
Just a box with a button on it.

53
00:03:42,263 --> 00:03:45,974
- I don't even remem ber what it does.
- But it m ust do something .

54
00:03:46,142 --> 00:03:47,726
Maybe it opens the ja-rage door.

55
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:54,483
Oh , dear.

56
00:03:56,486 --> 00:03:57,945
Greetings, hero.

57
00:03:58,112 --> 00:04:01,865
You've just unleashed
an unspeakabIe eviI upon Metrocity,

58
00:04:02,033 --> 00:04:05,160
and you're reaIIy,
reaIIy not going to Iike it.

59
00:04:13,044 --> 00:04:14,962
- Where did it go?
- I don't know.

60
00:04:16,422 --> 00:04:19,800
Unspeakable evil, activated.

61
00:04:23,638 --> 00:04:25,847
Sir, what was the unspeakable evil?

62
00:04:26,015 --> 00:04:28,517
l've had a lot of evil plans
over the years.

63
00:04:28,685 --> 00:04:30,727
- You forgot.
- You should've catalogued them

64
00:04:30,895 --> 00:04:32,271
- so I wouldn't have to remem ber.
- What?!

65
00:04:32,438 --> 00:04:35,857
- This is actually your fault.
- My fault? How is this my fault?

66
00:04:36,025 --> 00:04:37,609
l'm thinking . It could be anything .

67
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:40,404
- Remem ber the Forget-Me Bom b?
- Yes! No.

68
00:04:40,571 --> 00:04:42,948
What about
the Encyclopedia A-bom b-ica?

69
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:44,866
Rock 'Em , Sock 'Em Kittens.

70
00:04:45,034 --> 00:04:46,910
They were as cute as they were deadly.

71
00:04:47,078 --> 00:04:49,496
- The Destructosaur.
- Wait.

72
00:04:49,664 --> 00:04:51,957
lt's something beginning with M.

73
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:54,626
M, that really narrows it down .

74
00:05:00,383 --> 00:05:03,218
Don't move.
l think I remem bered what it is.

75
00:05:03,386 --> 00:05:04,678
lt's my favorite!

76
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:09,808
- It's the Mega-Megam ind .
- Ollo!

77
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:13,228
l transferred my evil personality
into a giant ra-bot.

78
00:05:13,396 --> 00:05:15,939
- Man , I do good work.
- Really terrific stuff,

79
00:05:16,107 --> 00:05:18,108
but we should probably turn it off.

80
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:20,777
White suit, white cape,

81
00:05:20,945 --> 00:05:23,530
if it isn't my oId friend, Metro Man.

82
00:05:24,073 --> 00:05:28,577
- He thinks you're Metro Man .
- Well , I am defender of Metrocity now.

83
00:05:28,745 --> 00:05:32,039
This is the perfect time for me
to debut my super-suit.

84
00:05:32,206 --> 00:05:33,915
Activate super-strength .

85
00:05:43,301 --> 00:05:46,803
Gross.
I just stepped in a pile of hero.

86
00:05:47,305 --> 00:05:48,805
Activate super-boots.

87
00:05:52,435 --> 00:05:53,518
Sir!

88
00:05:55,646 --> 00:05:57,522
Ole!

89
00:05:57,690 --> 00:05:59,066
Right. I forgot about that.

90
00:05:59,233 --> 00:06:00,776
Help!

91
00:06:06,949 --> 00:06:07,991
Time out.

92
00:06:08,534 --> 00:06:09,534
Oh , no!

93
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:13,080
Activate super-laser vision .

94
00:06:21,964 --> 00:06:23,799
Where. . . Where is he?

95
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:27,928
Sir?

96
00:06:28,971 --> 00:06:33,433
- Sir, are you in the invisible car?
- No.

97
00:06:33,601 --> 00:06:35,143
Are you a chicken?

98
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:38,647
Get in .

99
00:06:40,525 --> 00:06:41,817
We're in trouble, Minion .

100
00:06:41,984 --> 00:06:45,737
l program med it to never stop
until it elim inated the hero.

101
00:06:47,824 --> 00:06:49,866
lt's out there, searching for me.

102
00:06:50,034 --> 00:06:51,827
Where are you, hero?

103
00:06:51,994 --> 00:06:53,537
ls it searching for me, too?

104
00:06:53,704 --> 00:06:55,831
And your mysterious friend,

105
00:06:55,998 --> 00:06:59,126
who's dressed up as Minion
for some reason.

106
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:02,045
But don't worry,
we can live in here from now on .

107
00:07:02,213 --> 00:07:06,633
- The brain-bots can bring us snacks.
- Sir, that is crazy.

108
00:07:06,801 --> 00:07:08,552
We're gonna have
to face this thing eventually.

109
00:07:08,719 --> 00:07:12,722
Did you m iss what happened out there?
The new me is an utter failure.

110
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:17,519
- Well , it's clear you're no Metro Man .
- I know I'm not Metro Man .

111
00:07:17,687 --> 00:07:23,233
l just mean , maybe you should stop
trying to be him and just be you .

112
00:07:23,401 --> 00:07:27,195
Really? Is that possible?

113
00:07:27,363 --> 00:07:32,492
- But I sold all my evil stuff.
- Well . . . not everything .

114
00:07:34,203 --> 00:07:38,290
Spee-ider-bot. I don't understand .
l thought everything was gone.

115
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:40,750
l just couldn't part
with our spider-bot, sir.

116
00:07:40,918 --> 00:07:45,213
l was thinking maybe we could
still use him to patrol heroically.

117
00:07:45,381 --> 00:07:48,383
Minion , you sentimental sim ian , you .

118
00:07:50,928 --> 00:07:52,971
Now, I just need a plan .

119
00:07:53,848 --> 00:07:58,101
- Wait a m inute! Boingo!
- I think you mean "bingo," sir.

120
00:07:58,269 --> 00:08:01,480
That's what I said . Boingo!

121
00:08:02,773 --> 00:08:06,067
Anyone home?
Come out so I can squish you.

122
00:08:06,235 --> 00:08:08,612
Hey, beta box.

123
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:12,782
Ready for round two, hero?

124
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:22,083
Are you in the mood
for a slice of hero pie?

125
00:08:22,251 --> 00:08:25,795
OnIy if it comes a Ia expIode.

126
00:08:31,677 --> 00:08:33,094
Where'd you go?

127
00:08:34,555 --> 00:08:37,599
Do you feel the taunting power
of my eyebrow?

128
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:39,684
How dare you brow me!

129
00:08:43,564 --> 00:08:45,065
Oh , yes!

130
00:08:51,906 --> 00:08:53,156
Missed again .

131
00:08:55,159 --> 00:08:58,954
That's right, metal face,
follow me to your doom .

132
00:09:01,624 --> 00:09:05,544
OK, Minion , ready the death ray.

133
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:07,045
Yes, sir.

134
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:12,133
Prepare to meet your maker:

135
00:09:12,301 --> 00:09:13,885
Me.

136
00:09:17,682 --> 00:09:20,058
Say bye-bye, Metro Man.

137
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:21,476
Fire, Minion .

138
00:09:22,353 --> 00:09:24,020
Minion , fire.

139
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:27,816
- Slight problem here, sir.
- Slight problem? How slight?

140
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:30,694
Your super-suit
smashed the death ray controls.

141
00:09:33,489 --> 00:09:36,533
What the. . .? Impossible.

142
00:09:37,326 --> 00:09:40,245
- Minion , find the remote.
- Oh , right.

143
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:43,665
You know, we should really mark these.
Do you remem ber what it looked like?

144
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:47,711
No, I don't remember
what it Iooked Iike. Try the. . .

145
00:09:47,878 --> 00:09:49,296
Well , it's not that one.

146
00:09:50,172 --> 00:09:53,550
- Minion , turn it off.
- Peekaboo!

147
00:09:56,178 --> 00:09:58,680
You can crawI, but you can't hide.

148
00:09:58,848 --> 00:10:01,558
What about this one?

149
00:10:01,726 --> 00:10:03,643
No. No.

150
00:10:03,811 --> 00:10:06,104
Talk about a crushing defeat.

151
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:08,940
The old evil me is so annoying .

152
00:10:11,944 --> 00:10:13,528
H urry, Minion !

153
00:10:15,531 --> 00:10:17,365
l can't keep this up!

154
00:10:21,662 --> 00:10:23,913
Minion ! What are you doing?

155
00:10:24,332 --> 00:10:25,957
l've got it, sir.

156
00:10:30,838 --> 00:10:33,882
OK, Minion , on my marco.

157
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:36,009
I hate spee-iders.

158
00:10:37,595 --> 00:10:38,678
Marco!

159
00:10:39,972 --> 00:10:41,598
Polo!

160
00:10:43,601 --> 00:10:44,976
Oh, no!

161
00:10:52,568 --> 00:10:55,153
Goodbye, old me.

162
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,825
We did it! We did it!

163
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:03,078
Yes, we did , Minion .

164
00:11:03,245 --> 00:11:07,290
Now, let's go get the rest
of our evil stuff back.

165
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:17,467
- No more school !
- We're free!

166
00:11:17,635 --> 00:11:18,635
No parents!

167
00:11:20,388 --> 00:11:23,431
- Booger.
- With our parents dehydrated ,

168
00:11:23,599 --> 00:11:28,019
we can rule Metro City. Yes!

169
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:31,856
Not today or any other day,

170
00:11:32,024 --> 00:11:34,192
my sugar-fueled friend .

171
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:37,779
- Oh , my goodness.
- I'll take that, thank you very m uch .

172
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:40,573
l'd normally cart your heinies downtown ,

173
00:11:40,741 --> 00:11:46,121
but I have a feeling your parents will
offer you a far more severe punishment.

174
00:11:46,288 --> 00:11:49,207
A glass of water, Minion , if you please.

175
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:52,544
No!

176
00:11:55,798 --> 00:11:59,300
Well , sir, the weapons of justice
are back where they belong .

177
00:11:59,468 --> 00:12:01,803
Let's just hope the city
is ready for me.

178
00:12:01,971 --> 00:12:05,306
- I'd say it is, sir.
- Look.

179
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:08,226
They made me my own signal .

180
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:11,938
Us. They made us our own signal .

181
00:12:12,898 --> 00:12:15,817
Pull yourself together, Minion !
Now, make a note.

182
00:12:15,985 --> 00:12:17,986
- It needs to be a lot bigger.
- Yes, sir.

183
00:12:18,154 --> 00:12:20,822
Let's go patrol , heroically.

184
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:31,958
Oh , what fun !
