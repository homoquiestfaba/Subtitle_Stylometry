the Cinderella story of 1939.

That's right. Local radio
station WBN may be small,

but they've got
a lot of big dreams.

And tonight,
those dreams could come true

12

in their revolutionary attempt

13
00:01:05,032 --> 00:01:08,195
to create a fourth

Oh, Miss Henderson,

15
00:01:09,737 --> 00:01:12,138
the Biff Blaster, Space Ranger script is a minute and a half over,

16
00:01:12,206 --> 00:01:13,935

what he should do.

17

that I'm not just a page.

You know,
I'm a man of many talents,

22
00:01:22,583 --> 00:01:24,415
and if you ever give me
a chance to prove myself,

23
00:01:24,485 --> 00:01:26,476
you won't be sorry, Miss Henderson. Mrs. Henderson.

Speaking of tense,
I'm busy.

35
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:53,841

Kill him in the first act.
We'll have one more go at it.

No time for slackers.

Thirty minutes to combat.
Chest out, shoulders back.

Little more spit
on that shine.

00:02:25,112 --> 00:02:28,605
Excuse me, General, sir, you're needed back in your office.

Can't lead the troops
from the rear.

A philosophy professor
who murders people

68
00:03:15,562 --> 00:03:17,394
by convincing them
they don't exist?

69
00:03:17,464 --> 00:03:18,989
It's satire, Mr. King.

70
00:03:19,066 --> 00:03:21,262
It's crapola, Mrs. Henderson!

Little disagreements?

77

You had an affair, Roger, with the station manager's wife.

I told you 100 times
nothing happened.

as the Va-Va-Va-Voom Girl.

everything was jake,

82

and you had to throw it all away for one night of pleasure.

83
00:03:51,999 --> 00:03:54,195
Well, believe me, sister,
there was no pleasure.

what King just did?

halfthe scripts.

He threw out
halfthe scripts.

stand up to him.

We just found
Walt hanging there.

I infer by your use
ofthe plural

688
00:33:17,362 --> 00:33:19,023
that there was somebody else
up there with you?

I've got one question
for you, young man.

Why were you up there?

696
00:33:33,612 --> 00:33:35,706
Did you have business in that studio? What were you doing?

697
00:33:35,781 --> 00:33:37,840
Isn't that three questions?

698
00:33:38,650 --> 00:33:41,244

I was looking for Penny.

699

He's a writer.

Why weren't we notified?

708
00:34:02,374 --> 00:34:05,742
It was a trumpet player, but the doctor said it was just a heart attack.

709
00:34:05,811 --> 00:34:09,873
The coroner says different. Says your trumpet player was murdered!

710
00:34:10,482 --> 00:34:13,281
Pickled with
an arsenic-and-gin cocktail.

very explainable, okay?

I was running by when they were carrying Ruffles‘ body offthe stage.

717
00:34:34,273 --> 00:34:36,833
And he happened to drop his flask on my script, and ljust...

718

a classical tragedy

859
00:42:03,922 --> 00:42:06,357
in three acts. Act One,

860
00:42:06,424 --> 00:42:08,586
Claudette and young
Walt Whalen Junior

861
00:42:08,727 --> 00:42:10,889
were indulging in
some illicit sexercise.

862
00:42:10,962 --> 00:42:12,293
Exhibit A.

863
00:42:15,433 --> 00:42:16,901
Ruffles Reedy had the photos.

864
00:42:16,968 --> 00:42:18,060
He was blackmailing them,

865
00:42:18,136 --> 00:42:20,332
threatening to go to C|audette‘s husband, Katzenback.

866
00:42:20,405 --> 00:42:24,774
So Walt Junior put an end to Ruffles Reedy. He shut him up permanently

867
00:42:25,243 --> 00:42:27,234
with poison. Exhibit B.

868
00:42:27,879 --> 00:42:29,347
Unfortunately...

869
00:42:30,615 --> 00:42:32,083
Unfortunately...

870
00:42:32,584 --> 00:42:34,143
Excuse me.

871
00:42:34,285 --> 00:42:35,878
Unfortunately,
he killed him too late.

872
00:42:35,954 --> 00:42:38,321
Ruffles had already blown
his tune to Katzenback.

873
00:42:38,390 --> 00:42:40,119
Am I going too fast
foryou, Lieutenant?

874
00:42:40,191 --> 00:42:41,659
Yeah, you wise guy...
Act Two.

875
00:42:41,926 --> 00:42:43,018
In a fit of insane jealousy,

876
00:42:43,094 --> 00:42:45,188
Katzenback kills Walt Junior,
his wife's young lover,

877
00:42:45,263 --> 00:42:48,961
which brings us to Act Three,
the final act. The denouement.

878
00:42:49,634 --> 00:42:53,662
Where Claudette, distraught, avenges Walt Junior's death by killing her husband,

879
00:42:53,738 --> 00:42:57,538
Herman Katzenback. Lights down, curtain, thunderous applause.

884
00:43:11,356 --> 00:43:14,587
I'm proud to have brought Claudette Katzenback to justice.

885
00:43:14,759 --> 00:43:17,160
Though in a way,
I almost feel sorry for her.

886
00:43:17,228 --> 00:43:20,163
You know, such a bitter, conniving, twisted personality.

887
00:43:20,231 --> 00:43:22,290
I'll murder you,
you little punk.

Though you gotta love her way around a show tune.

Lieutenant, he hates me
because of a sillyjoke.

890
00:43:28,006 --> 00:43:31,704
You see, I made his wife believe we were having an affair.

891
00:43:31,776 --> 00:43:33,301
And this is his revenge.

892
00:43:33,378 --> 00:43:35,813
Well, it wasjust
a little joke, stupid!

893
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:37,575
Well, nobody‘s
laughing, sister.

The book's slamming shut
on this case.

898

I slammed my fingers
in a car door once.

Everyone get back to work.

1045
00:50:24,956 --> 00:50:26,788
So I guess we'll be needing
a new announcer, huh?

1046
00:50:26,858 --> 00:50:28,087
Go to Tom McCa||um‘s

1047
00:50:28,159 --> 00:50:30,025
tell him he‘sjust been
promoted to announcer.

We'll have the new announcer up and running before you can...

we might as well do it
and do it right.

Look, all I'm saying is,
we're a team.

to do theirjob

and get back to
caring about ours.

it wasn't me.

an FCC scandal there.

You were the one with Katzenback when he got crushed into kibble.

they were recordings.

to tell me what it means.

Oh, well, I got news for you. It's being broadcast over our airwaves.

Penny, what are you
trying to say?

1143
00:55:02,433 --> 00:55:03,992
You think this is my fault
or Tommy's?

1144
00:55:04,068 --> 00:55:06,662
No! I don't care whose fault it is. Good. Then understand

1145
00:55:06,737 --> 00:55:09,001
that the real problem is not where the voice is coming from.

1146
00:55:09,073 --> 00:55:11,303
Right.
It's who might die next.

1147
00:55:13,077 --> 00:55:15,739

killed by mistake.

Do you mean it?

2055
01:41:18,840 --> 01:41:21,309
You really are
the only guy for me.

2056
01:41:22,810 --> 01:41:24,005
I know.

2057
01:41:24,913 --> 01:41:26,142
‘‘I know‘‘?

2058
01:41:29,984 --> 01:41:32,954
What? What did I do now? Oh, nothing. Forget about it.

2059
01:41:33,021 --> 01:41:34,819
ROGER OVER LOUDSPEAKER:
What? What gives with you?

2060
01:41:34,889 --> 01:41:36,687
I was 1,000 feet up
in the air with a madman,

2061
01:41:36,758 --> 01:41:38,783
risking my life for you,
and you say forget it.

2062
01:41:38,860 --> 01:41:41,056
PENNY: Oh, well, nobody asked you to. I would have gone,

2063
01:41:41,129 --> 01:41:42,995
but, oh, no,
Mr. Marvel has to go.

2064
01:41:43,097 --> 01:41:44,565
I did it because I love you!

2065
01:41:44,632 --> 01:41:47,192
You love me? Well, what about how much I love you?

2066
01:41:47,268 --> 01:41:49,828
Oh, oh. So what you're saying is that you love me more than I love you?

2067
01:41:49,904 --> 01:41:51,702
Oh, you're impossible!
Oh, you're impossible!

2068
01:41:51,773 --> 01:41:53,400
(AUDIENCE CHEERING)

2069
01:42:17,398 --> 01:42:20,231
ANNOUNCER: And that's it
from WBN in Chicago.

2070
01:42:20,301 --> 01:42:22,167
If it wasn't clear before

2071
01:42:22,237 --> 01:42:24,262
it's certainly clear now.

2072
01:42:24,439 --> 01:42:28,774
There'll never be
anything quite like radio!
