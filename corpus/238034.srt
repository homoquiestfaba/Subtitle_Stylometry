1
00:00:21,536 --> 00:00:23,540
Hey, Kevin? Can I borrow your pencil?

2
00:00:23,612 --> 00:00:24,039
Sure.

3
00:00:24,374 --> 00:00:25,315
Thanks.

4
00:00:31,824 --> 00:00:32,977
Hey, Daria, wait up.

5
00:00:34,214 --> 00:00:36,545
Oh, yeah. Sorry, Kevin.

6
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:39,990
I know what you're after, but it won't work.

7
00:00:40,025 --> 00:00:43,607
I don't want the pencil. I just forgot to give it back.

8
00:00:43,642 --> 00:00:47,902
Let's not play games, Daria. You desire me, don't you?

9
00:00:47,937 --> 00:00:50,030
Uh, excuse me?

10
00:00:50,065 --> 00:00:53,262
I can tell. It's like a fifth sense I got.

11
00:00:53,297 --> 00:00:57,984
But unfortunately or whatever, I already got a chick.

12
00:00:58,019 --> 00:00:59,836
But we can still be friends or whatever.

13
00:00:59,871 --> 00:01:02,686
Thanks, Kevin. That helps.

14
00:01:02,721 --> 00:01:04,729
Great! Can I borrow your science homework?

15
00:01:06,255 --> 00:01:07,917
Hey, thanks a lot. Sorry if you were hurt.

16
00:01:10,598 --> 00:01:13,618
I just got blown off by a guy I didn't even go after.

17
00:01:13,653 --> 00:01:17,189
You should find a safe, legal alternative to killing him.

18
00:01:17,224 --> 00:01:20,253
I already have. When I get through with him,

19
00:01:20,288 --> 00:01:21,960
there'll be nothing left but jelly.

20
00:01:21,995 --> 00:01:24,931
Well, you won't have to do anything to his brain.

21
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:32,758
Nothing left but jelly...

22
00:01:45,012 --> 00:01:49,816
I baked these cookies for you! They're shaped like hearts!

23
00:01:49,851 --> 00:01:51,434
Uh... but...

24
00:01:51,469 --> 00:01:53,815
You don't have to use words around me, Kevin.

25
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:58,199
You don't need them. This is just to say, "No hard feelings. " Bye!

26
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:09,300
And then Scully, he grabs the kid and gives him a tenth degree wedgie.

27
00:02:09,335 --> 00:02:12,956
He's funny.

28
00:02:12,991 --> 00:02:14,361
Hi, Kevin!

29
00:02:17,209 --> 00:02:18,231
Uh, hi, Daria.

30
00:02:18,266 --> 00:02:19,762
Who's she?

31
00:02:19,797 --> 00:02:21,888
I'm Kevin's good friend.

32
00:02:21,923 --> 00:02:24,995
Which do you like better, the beach or the mountains?

33
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:30,225
Uh... I guess the beach. Because of, like, the bikinis.

34
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:32,697
Me, too. Just checking.

35
00:02:32,732 --> 00:02:35,883
Oh, and here's some extra homework of mine you can use.

36
00:02:35,918 --> 00:02:38,860
See you later... friend.

37
00:02:38,895 --> 00:02:43,327
Oooh! Manipulator! Pinhead! Weasel!

38
00:02:43,362 --> 00:02:47,410
Hey, hey, slow down! What was the first one you said?

39
00:02:56,769 --> 00:02:57,452
Really...

40
00:03:01,924 --> 00:03:05,361
Hey, Daria! Me and Brittany decided to see other people!

41
00:03:05,396 --> 00:03:08,552
So, since you're sorta next on the list or whatever...

42
00:03:08,587 --> 00:03:08,784
What?

43
00:03:08,819 --> 00:03:16,314
I said, I was wondering if you and me could get together?

44
00:03:18,951 --> 00:03:22,524
Mmm, I don't think so, Kevin. It might ruin our friendship.

45
00:03:25,419 --> 00:03:26,181
Geek.

46
00:03:26,216 --> 00:03:28,733
Hey, it's cool. We're good friends.

47
00:03:37,072 --> 00:03:39,666
Quinn, there were four calls on the machine from Kevin.

48
00:03:39,701 --> 00:03:41,665
Doesn't he have your beeper number?

49
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:43,707
They aren't for me. They're for Daria.

50
00:03:43,742 --> 00:03:44,814
Daria?

51
00:03:44,849 --> 00:03:46,983
Do you need a beeper, Daria?

52
00:03:47,018 --> 00:03:49,449
Do you want to talk to us about anything, honey?

53
00:03:52,522 --> 00:03:54,979
I was just about to open up, too.

54
00:03:58,425 --> 00:03:59,276
You think she meant it?

55
00:04:00,461 --> 00:04:04,635
I'm not giving up, Daria. I know there's a chemistry or whatever.

56
00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:06,634
I hate to say this, Kevin...

57
00:04:06,669 --> 00:04:07,659
Kevin?

58
00:04:07,694 --> 00:04:09,908
Quinn? What are you doing here?

59
00:04:09,943 --> 00:04:14,588
I live here. You're not here to see my sister, are you?

60
00:04:14,623 --> 00:04:17,948
Whoa! You're sisters with a brain?

61
00:04:17,983 --> 00:04:20,342
I know! Doesn't it suck?

62
00:04:20,377 --> 00:04:23,776
Really. Well, you want to go for a ride or something?

63
00:04:23,811 --> 00:04:24,966
Let me get my stuff.

64
00:04:27,581 --> 00:04:31,432
So anyways, you're probably right about us being friends and stuff,

65
00:04:31,467 --> 00:04:33,730
because we care about each others feelings and whatnot.

66
00:04:33,765 --> 00:04:37,304
Yeah, and I care even more about your feelings than my own.

67
00:04:37,339 --> 00:04:39,089
Really?

68
00:04:39,124 --> 00:04:42,156
Man, I never would have thought you'd be sisters with someone hot.

69
00:04:46,278 --> 00:04:48,405
I don't understand why you're not trying to get revenge.

70
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:51,041
I'm letting Quinn take care of that.

71
00:04:59,082 --> 00:05:01,251
Dammit! How many times is that thing gonna go off?

72
00:05:01,286 --> 00:05:05,071
I'm beginning to think you don't like being with someone attractive and popular

73
00:05:05,992 --> 00:05:07,115
Sorry!

74
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:10,006
That's better. Now, get me to a pay phone.
