00:13:22,102 --> 00:13:27,274
I contacted Al Riederer and
said, Al, can I be of help?

180
00:13:27,374 --> 00:13:30,043
And this is something
that I'm concerned about.

181
00:13:30,143 --> 00:13:32,745
I was particularly
concerned with the attitude

182
00:13:32,846 --> 00:13:35,015
The city took... a
lot of laughing,

183
00:13:35,115 --> 00:13:39,119
A lot of Berdella jokes,
making fun of what he had done,

184
00:13:39,219 --> 00:13:42,122
Which was one of
the worst crimes

185
00:13:42,222 --> 00:13:46,659
I'd ever seen in this city or
that anybody could possibly do.

186
00:13:46,759 --> 00:13:50,663
And I felt that something had
to be done to call attention

187
00:13:50,763 --> 00:13:54,935
To the seriousness of the crime
and to try to deal with it,

188
00:13:55,035 --> 00:13:56,036
To respond to it.

189
00:13:56,136 --> 00:13:58,872
And so my role initially
was to approach Al.

190
00:13:58,972 --> 00:14:02,642
I said, if I can be of help,
let me know, and he said OK.

191
00:14:02,742 --> 00:14:04,177
Bob is sort of suicidal.

192
00:14:04,277 --> 00:14:05,278
We want to keep him alive.

193
00:14:05,378 --> 00:14:07,847
We want to understand
what happened.

194
00:14:07,948 --> 00:14:10,183
We'll have you visit him
once or twice a week,

195
00:14:10,283 --> 00:14:11,818
But you have to keep it
quiet, and we'll put you

196
00:14:11,919 --> 00:14:13,520
In the back door of the jail.

197
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:15,588
We won't tell anybody you're
visiting him because you'll

198
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:17,357
Probably have some
death threats if anybody

199
00:14:17,457 --> 00:14:18,658
Knows you're coming in.

200
00:14:18,758 --> 00:14:20,093
It was pretty odd.

201
00:14:20,193 --> 00:14:22,729
Number one, it was
Easter weekend.

202
00:14:22,829 --> 00:14:25,365
It was on the Saturday
before Easter,

203
00:14:25,465 --> 00:14:26,766
So not something you
were particularly

204
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:28,969
Looking for to happen.

205
00:14:29,069 --> 00:14:31,871
It was in the middle of
the NCAA Final Four, which

206
00:14:31,972 --> 00:14:34,141
Was in Kansas City that year.

207
00:14:34,241 --> 00:14:36,109
And it was in the
middle of my reelection.

208
00:14:36,209 --> 00:14:39,046
It played into my reelection
because the person

209
00:14:39,146 --> 00:14:42,482
Who ran against me that year
kept bringing up the case

210
00:14:42,582 --> 00:14:44,551
And using it in the
campaign against me.

211
00:14:44,651 --> 00:14:46,920
I think it kind of
backfired on her,

212
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:51,191
But it became part of the
campaign nevertheless.

213
00:14:51,291 --> 00:14:54,194
So the timing of it
was truly unusual.

214
00:14:54,294 --> 00:14:57,430
I would love to
see him executed.

215
00:14:57,530 --> 00:14:59,899
I think what he
did is abominable.

216
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,135
There is no way to
minimize the atrocity

217
00:15:02,235 --> 00:15:04,938
Of what he did, regardless
of what his demeanor is

218
00:15:05,038 --> 00:15:06,006
In the interview.

219
00:15:06,106 --> 00:15:09,209
You cannot minimize
the inhumanity this

220
00:15:09,309 --> 00:15:10,944
Guy committed on other people.

221
00:15:11,044 --> 00:15:15,648
My initial thought
what was that it was

222
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:19,419
A couple of homosexuals who had
probably had a lovers' quarrel

223
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:23,890
And that it would play itself
out like many other cases

224
00:15:23,991 --> 00:15:28,028
Do that start out
in a similar nature.

225
00:15:28,128 --> 00:15:31,864
I was in charge of the fugitive
apprehension that handled

226
00:15:31,965 --> 00:15:37,670
Missing persons,
and at the time,

227
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:42,909
There were two missing
persons reports filed.

228
00:15:43,010 --> 00:15:49,182
In both those missing persons
reports, the common denominator

229
00:15:49,282 --> 00:15:54,054
At that time was Bob Berdella.

230
00:15:54,154 --> 00:15:57,724
I was the courts reporter,
Jackson County courts,

231
00:15:57,824 --> 00:16:04,397
For the Kansas City Times, and
so I heard the announcement.

232
00:16:04,497 --> 00:16:08,301
I knew it was going to
be coming up on my beat.

233
00:16:08,401 --> 00:16:11,138
Tom Jackman was
cops, I was courts.

234
00:16:11,238 --> 00:16:12,905
It was pretty much our ballgame.

235
00:16:13,006 --> 00:16:15,508
Bob's base of
operations during the day

236
00:16:15,608 --> 00:16:17,210
And where he came
when he had guys tied

237
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:20,447
To his bed in his house was
right there at the Westport

238
00:16:20,547 --> 00:16:22,649
Flea Market Bar & Grill.

239
00:16:22,749 --> 00:16:25,985
He had this booth called Bob's
Bizarre Bazaar, where he sold

240
00:16:26,086 --> 00:16:31,091
Just a lot of weird
stuff... shrunken heads,

241
00:16:31,191 --> 00:16:34,461
Bone jewelry,
paintings, antiques.

242
00:16:34,561 --> 00:16:38,331
He considered himself this
sort of man of the world that

243
00:16:38,431 --> 00:16:41,234
Was bringing in all these
incredible valuables to you,

244
00:16:41,334 --> 00:16:43,836
The lowly public, and
people that shopped there

245
00:16:43,936 --> 00:16:46,273
Are always talked about what
a condescending dickhead

246
00:16:46,373 --> 00:16:47,807
He could be.

247
00:16:47,907 --> 00:16:48,908
I started collecting
and dealing

248
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:51,544
In ethnic folk art back in '71.

249
00:16:51,644 --> 00:16:56,516
And then in '78, I came over
here to basically temporarily

250
00:16:56,616 --> 00:16:57,617
Clean out my basement.

251
00:16:57,717 --> 00:16:59,586
I had a basement sale
to clean out my house,

252
00:16:59,686 --> 00:17:01,888
And then I came over here
to clean out my basement.

253
00:17:01,988 --> 00:17:03,056
It just did very well.

254
00:17:03,156 --> 00:17:04,457
I started bringing
over some of the stuff

255
00:17:04,557 --> 00:17:08,228
That I was dealing in as far
as the ethnic jewelry and folk

256
00:17:08,328 --> 00:17:09,196
Art.

257
00:17:09,296 --> 00:17:10,663
The weekend that
Berdella was caught,

258
00:17:10,763 --> 00:17:12,532
The NCAA basketball
Final Four was

259
00:17:12,632 --> 00:17:13,700
Being played in Kansas City.

260
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,535
Now, Bob couldn't give
a damn about basketball,

261
00:17:15,635 --> 00:17:17,637
But he did want to capitalize
on all the hype and all

262
00:17:17,737 --> 00:17:20,440
The tourists, so he
put four human skulls

263
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:22,775
In the window there with
a little sign beneath it

264
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:25,178
Said "The Final Four."

265
00:17:25,278 --> 00:17:27,980
[Music playing]

266
00:17:32,152 --> 00:17:33,653
I made a mistake.

267
00:17:33,753 --> 00:17:34,987
That's what I
thought at the time.

268
00:17:35,088 --> 00:17:37,257
I knew that this was for real
when I was up in that bed.

269
00:17:37,357 --> 00:17:39,092
I thought about my
kids and I thought

270
00:17:39,192 --> 00:17:42,395
About that stupid-ass
decision that I had made.

271
00:17:42,495 --> 00:17:44,831
And it was a real hard one.

272
00:17:44,931 --> 00:17:47,800
[Music playing]

273
00:18:00,747 --> 00:18:07,187
They were young white males
who we suspect most of them

274
00:18:07,287 --> 00:18:10,490
Were involved in
male prostitution.

275
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:12,259
We don't know that
about all of them,

276
00:18:12,359 --> 00:18:16,028
But clearly they
were particularly

277
00:18:16,129 --> 00:18:20,133
The ones you picked up off of
the street where some of those

278
00:18:20,233 --> 00:18:22,835
Were involved in
male prostitution.

279
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:26,373
What's interesting to me
is that with respect to all

280
00:18:26,473 --> 00:18:30,109
Of these people,
he turned what he

281
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:35,882
Saw as a slight against
himself into a vendetta

282
00:18:35,982 --> 00:18:39,452
Against the individual,
a vendetta so terrible

283
00:18:39,552 --> 00:18:42,289
That it was worth killing for.

284
00:18:42,389 --> 00:18:46,326
And it was clear
from the confession

285
00:18:46,426 --> 00:18:52,432
That he had sexual designs
on all of these people.

286
00:18:52,532 --> 00:18:54,334
OK, it's Berdella's
confession now.

287
00:18:54,434 --> 00:18:55,602
I don't want no fucking around.

288
00:18:55,702 --> 00:18:57,804
Just go in there and
tale care of him.

289
00:18:57,904 --> 00:19:00,607
I don't want no fucking around.

290
00:19:00,707 --> 00:19:03,476
First of all, his name isn't
"Bordello," it's Berdella.

291
00:19:03,576 --> 00:19:05,111
It's an Italian name, shithead.

292
00:19:05,212 --> 00:19:07,347
Excuse me, I'm sorry.

293
00:19:07,447 --> 00:19:08,748
Please raise your right hand.

294
00:19:08,848 --> 00:19:11,218
Do you swear to tell the truth,
the whole truth, and nothing

295
00:19:11,318 --> 00:19:12,952
But the truth, so help you God?

296
00:19:13,052 --> 00:19:14,454
Yes.

[Suspenseful music playing]

298
00:21:58,585 --> 00:22:01,688
I think that he had a
longstanding love affair

299
00:22:01,788 --> 00:22:04,791
With the male anatomy
and like a little kid

Playing with an erector
set or playing with one

Of those models
of the human body,

302
00:22:09,562 --> 00:22:11,664
He wanted to find
out what was inside.

303
00:22:11,764 --> 00:22:13,933
In other words, it's the
ultimate objectification

304
00:22:14,033 --> 00:22:17,003
Of another human being.

305
00:22:17,103 --> 00:22:19,205
We got woken up yesterday
at the crack of dawn

306
00:22:19,305 --> 00:22:21,808
With the sound of heavy
machinery digging in the yard

307
00:22:21,908 --> 00:22:24,544
Next door and we thought,
what the heck is going on?

308
00:22:24,644 --> 00:22:26,679
And then it came out
in the news that day

309
00:22:26,779 --> 00:22:31,050
That they had found skeletal
remains buried in the back yard

310
00:22:31,150 --> 00:22:32,218
Of our neighbor Bob Berdella.

311
00:22:34,621 --> 00:22:35,588
I don't know.

312
00:22:35,688 --> 00:22:37,289
You seemed like a
good enough neighbor.

313
00:22:37,390 --> 00:22:40,827
He was a quiet guy,
but I can tell you

314
00:22:40,927 --> 00:22:46,132
From everyone I've talked to, he
just always smelled really bad.

315
00:22:46,232 --> 00:22:49,536
My first reaction
that this was a biggie

316
00:22:49,636 --> 00:22:52,338
Was when we dug the head up
out of the backyard on Easter

317
00:22:52,439 --> 00:22:53,305
Sunday.

318
00:22:53,406 --> 00:22:55,742
That's what it
really first hit me

319
00:22:55,842 --> 00:22:59,846
And I knew then that we
had a major investigation

320
00:22:59,946 --> 00:23:01,714
On our hands and I
probably was going

321
00:23:01,814 --> 00:23:04,283
To be in the middle of it.

322
00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:07,253
[Suspenseful music playing]

323
00:24:56,896 --> 00:24:59,198
Well, the way I got
involved with Bob Berdella

324
00:24:59,298 --> 00:25:02,769
Is I'd done a lot of
investigative reporting

325
00:25:02,869 --> 00:25:04,571
For national
magazines, including

326
00:25:04,671 --> 00:25:08,608
A book called Assassination
in America, and I was local.

327
00:25:08,708 --> 00:25:13,379
So they were looking for someone
with a criminal background,

328
00:25:13,479 --> 00:25:16,783
Knew how to ask questions,
do that sort of thing.

329
00:25:16,883 --> 00:25:20,286
And I was contacted and
conducted a whole bunch

330
00:25:20,386 --> 00:25:23,122
Of audio interviews with
Berdella for the Jackson County

331
00:25:23,222 --> 00:25:27,660
Jail as preparation
for the video interview

332
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,796
That we eventually did with him.

333
00:25:29,896 --> 00:25:31,764
Mr. Berdella,
you're sitting here

334
00:25:31,864 --> 00:25:35,802
As a man who's going to spend
the rest of his life in prison.

335
00:25:35,902 --> 00:25:38,605
You've confessed to the murder
of six young men in this city

336
00:25:38,705 --> 00:25:43,976
And crimes that horrified the
city and much of the country.

337
00:25:44,076 --> 00:25:48,414
You've confessed to various
degrees, felonious restraint,

338
00:25:48,514 --> 00:25:50,717
Drugging people,
sexually abusing

339
00:25:50,817 --> 00:25:54,220
Them, torturing them, killing
them, dismembering them.

340
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:57,556
And until now, you've
refused all interviews.

341
00:25:57,657 --> 00:25:59,258
So in light of all
those facts, I have

342
00:25:59,358 --> 00:26:01,227
To ask you why you're here.

343
00:26:01,327 --> 00:26:02,662
What is it you
have to say to us?

344
00:26:02,762 --> 00:26:05,932
What is it you want to say
about yourself in this case?

345
00:26:06,032 --> 00:26:09,669
Well, I've had the media
clamoring to get interviews

346
00:26:09,769 --> 00:26:17,810
With me and after I
made my last pleas,

347
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:23,916
I wanted to get at least
part of my side of it out.

348
00:26:24,016 --> 00:26:28,888
I find it very hard to find any

It's easy to reattach.

And I was really shocked.

395

that the cops are just

about Bob Della,

My first thought
was from knowing him

And then sometimes then
I would ask him for them,

was trying to force them to me.

00:37:33,118 --> 00:37:34,420
Then he disappeared again.

518
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:39,625
He came back and he injected a
hypodermic needle in my throat

519
00:37:39,725 --> 00:37:43,929
All around the vocal
cords with Drano.

520
00:37:44,029 --> 00:37:45,531
He took some Q-tips.

521
00:37:45,631 --> 00:37:49,167
He came back in and he
stabbed them in my eye

522
00:37:49,267 --> 00:37:50,101
With some bleach.

523
00:37:50,201 --> 00:37:51,437
He had the Q-tips
with some bleach

524
00:37:51,537 --> 00:37:52,638
And he was stabbing
them in my eyes.

525
00:37:54,873 --> 00:37:58,510
After he did all that, I
was pretty much messed up

526
00:37:58,610 --> 00:38:05,317
And I think he injected me with
some more antibodies up there.

527
00:38:05,417 --> 00:38:07,953
During the next couple
days, I was sick.

528
00:38:08,053 --> 00:38:10,756
I was getting...
Pneumonia was setting in.

529
00:38:10,856 --> 00:38:11,757
This is what he told me.

530
00:38:11,857 --> 00:38:13,859
I just knew I was dying.

531
00:38:13,959 --> 00:38:17,295
He said he wanted to
put me in a cold bath

532
00:38:17,396 --> 00:38:19,765
So he could break the
fever, all this crap.

533
00:38:19,865 --> 00:38:21,500
He was injecting me with
penicillin in my legs

534
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:23,502
To make sure... I
think he was trying

535
00:38:23,602 --> 00:38:25,904
To keep me alive for
a while at that point.

536
00:38:29,675 --> 00:38:33,512
I think his intention with the
torture was to break your will

537
00:38:33,612 --> 00:38:37,883
And you would just not
give him no problems.

538
00:38:37,983 --> 00:38:40,619
The only time I ever got up,
he would allow me to get up,

539
00:38:40,719 --> 00:38:46,057
Was when I had to go to the
bathroom and do a number two.

540
00:38:46,157 --> 00:38:48,326
OK.

541
00:38:48,427 --> 00:38:50,896
In the bed, is what he said.

542
00:38:50,996 --> 00:38:53,432
And when I had to
take a bath one time.

543
00:38:53,532 --> 00:38:55,967
And he wanted me
to shave one time.

544
00:38:56,067 --> 00:38:58,870
My eyes had swollen
up like golf balls.

545
00:38:58,970 --> 00:39:02,441
I couldn't see out of my
eyes and I couldn't talk,

546
00:39:02,541 --> 00:39:05,911
And my arms were at
least twice the size

547
00:39:06,011 --> 00:39:08,514
From being no movement in them,
there was no blood flow in them

548
00:39:08,614 --> 00:39:09,314
Like that.

549
00:39:11,149 --> 00:39:13,852
It's hardly to be a man and say
shit happened to you like that,

550
00:39:13,952 --> 00:39:15,887
So really what
bought me a couple

00:39:15,987 --> 00:39:19,925
Times from his sexual
shit was just passing

552
00:39:20,025 --> 00:39:23,595
Out, acting like I was so sick.

553
00:39:23,695 --> 00:39:26,532
I'm not trying to
say he had a heart,

554
00:39:26,632 --> 00:39:31,169
But I guess he just didn't
want me to die at the time.

555
00:39:31,269 --> 00:39:32,871
Well, like Joseph
Mengele and the people

556
00:39:32,971 --> 00:39:35,607
In the concentration
camps during World War II,

557
00:39:35,707 --> 00:39:36,875
He was an experimenter.

558
00:39:36,975 --> 00:39:39,377
He experimented with
caustic chemicals,

559
00:39:39,478 --> 00:39:41,447
Shot the young
male prostitutes up

560
00:39:41,547 --> 00:39:45,551
With Drano in the vocal cords
to see if he could mute them,

561
00:39:45,651 --> 00:39:49,387
And he took hundreds of
photographs of them, Polaroids,

562
00:39:49,488 --> 00:39:52,924
And these were... of course, he
couldn't go to your local One

563
00:39:53,024 --> 00:39:56,495
Hour Speedy Print and get them
developed without condemning

564
00:39:56,595 --> 00:40:00,766
Himself... but these were
there for purposes of savoring

565
00:40:00,866 --> 00:40:03,635
And purposes of
masturbation, and it gave

566
00:40:03,735 --> 00:40:05,537
Him a sense of accomplishment.

567
00:40:05,637 --> 00:40:07,706
Also he knew damn well he
couldn't go out and kill

568
00:40:07,806 --> 00:40:10,442
Every day, that the hammer
would fall much quicker than it

569
00:40:10,542 --> 00:40:12,911
Finally did, so this
was a way for him

570
00:40:13,011 --> 00:40:17,583
To relieve, to relive, the
torture of his victims.

571
00:40:17,683 --> 00:40:20,486
After Berdella got
these guys in his house

572
00:40:20,586 --> 00:40:26,758
And in his bedroom, he basically
had intercourse with them

573
00:40:26,858 --> 00:40:28,527
By whatever means possible.

574
00:40:28,627 --> 00:40:32,363
And he would at times
photograph himself

575
00:40:32,464 --> 00:40:36,267
In the act of having anal
intercourse with somebody

576
00:40:36,367 --> 00:40:40,405
Or forcing them to
give him a blow job.

577
00:40:40,506 --> 00:40:47,846
He sodomized them with his fist,
with a cucumber, with a carrot,

578
00:40:47,946 --> 00:40:49,347
And he noted all these things.

579
00:40:49,447 --> 00:40:51,783
That's how we know this,
is because he made notes

580
00:40:51,883 --> 00:40:57,422
In his notes of what position he
took when he was screwing them,

581
00:40:57,523 --> 00:41:02,761
Whether it was BF for butt
fuck or FF for front fuck

582
00:41:02,861 --> 00:41:07,766
Or SF for side fuck or CF for
carrot fuck or cucumber fuck.

583
00:41:07,866 --> 00:41:10,602
It was pretty amazing stuff.

584
00:41:10,702 --> 00:41:13,338
Another report was that

00:41:13,438 --> 00:41:16,975
Torture logs and diaries.

00:41:17,075 --> 00:41:18,844
Did you?

587
00:41:18,944 --> 00:41:24,415
I kept sheets of paper that
I had made some notations on.

This is between the mattress
and springs on my bed.

Innumerous photographs
and what became

00:41:34,025 --> 00:41:37,696
To be known as meticulous
methodical diaries.

592
00:41:37,796 --> 00:41:41,933
Those pieces of paper in there
are these meticulous diaries.

593
00:41:42,033 --> 00:41:45,771
These are the pictures of
more than 200 photographs, some

Of them young men,
sexual partners,

And these are in
some ways... and these

That we see here are
the sheets of paper

597
00:41:55,413 --> 00:41:57,048
Upon which you made notes.

598
00:41:57,148 --> 00:41:59,417
Right.

This is a copy of
one of those pages.

600
00:42:05,557 --> 00:42:09,561
But it looks like
a loose-leaf paper.

601
00:42:09,661 --> 00:42:12,097
It does contain
information about amounts

602
00:42:12,197 --> 00:42:18,169
Of drugs and so on, so what is
your complaint with the police

603

Calling these detailed diaries?

604
00:42:21,439 --> 00:42:25,443
By your evaluation, does
this look methodical?

605
00:42:25,543 --> 00:42:27,112
Doesn't look methodical.

606
00:42:27,212 --> 00:42:28,980
Meticulous?

607
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:32,117

Tries to describe them ass.

00:42:42,961 --> 00:42:44,596

Berdella's a homosexual and he
practiced sodomy on his victims

615
00:43:27,906 --> 00:43:31,109
With his fist, with
various vegetables,

616
00:43:31,209 --> 00:43:34,680
And the pain must've
been excruciating.

617
00:43:34,780 --> 00:43:39,350
And although I don't believe
in the death penalty per se,

618
00:43:39,450 --> 00:43:42,220
I almost wish it
could be stretched

619
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:43,855
To fry guys like Berdella.

620
00:43:43,955 --> 00:43:44,856
Of course, he's dead now.

621
00:43:44,956 --> 00:43:46,958
Died of a heart
attack back in prison.

622
00:43:47,058 --> 00:43:48,159
So like, yeah.

I'm glad he's dead.

624
00:43:49,627 --> 00:43:50,796
He was a piece of shit.

625
00:43:50,896 --> 00:43:53,464
He was without
redeeming social value.

626
00:43:53,564 --> 00:43:57,535
It may be, even though
closure's a fatuous concept that

627

Never occurs for any victim
or relative of a victim

628
00:44:01,907 --> 00:44:03,975
Or loved one of a
victim, I'd like

629
00:44:04,075 --> 00:44:05,643
To think that he's
suffering right now

630
00:44:05,744 --> 00:44:07,412
And that the Prince

633
00:45:11,009 --> 00:45:12,610
It's entirely
true that Berdella

634
00:45:12,710 --> 00:45:14,379
Killed marginal people.

635
00:45:14,479 --> 00:45:16,714
He killed people
who were vulnerable,

636
00:45:16,815 --> 00:45:18,649
Who were vulnerable
to drugging, who

637
00:45:18,750 --> 00:45:22,187
Were vulnerable to being
lured to a secret spot

638
00:45:22,287 --> 00:45:23,822
And then killed.

Had he been a

more police attention

On this very, very early.

642
00:45:30,996 --> 00:45:34,465
And I think part of the reason
that there was no outrage

643
00:45:34,565 --> 00:45:37,235
Was because the young men
involved work for the most

644
00:45:37,335 --> 00:45:38,870
Part male prostitutes.

645
00:45:38,970 --> 00:45:40,071
They were from broken homes.

646
00:45:40,171 --> 00:45:42,673
They left home.

647
00:45:42,774 --> 00:45:46,644
They didn't have a community
around them to protest,

648
00:45:46,744 --> 00:45:50,481
And so the media and
the public in general

649
00:45:50,581 --> 00:45:52,984
Did not attach the same
value to those lives

650

But because they were
prostitutes for the most part,

654
00:46:06,197 --> 00:46:08,233
Because they were runaways,
because they didn't have

was Bob Berdella,

And we tried to go
after Bob Berdella.

664
00:46:40,431 --> 00:46:43,268

because these people

Had some kind of history.

We pursued it, and that
is a falsehood there.

667

because of their race, sex,

religion, or whatever

throw that on the back burner.

would've done any differently.

00:48:13,858 --> 00:48:15,961
I was not a male prostitute.

689
00:48:16,061 --> 00:48:19,297
I was addicted to
drugs at the time.

690
00:48:19,397 --> 00:48:23,134
His line was, you get high?

691
00:48:23,234 --> 00:48:24,502
His line was, you get high?

692
00:48:24,602 --> 00:48:30,075
I got some Valiums at the
time he had cigarette money.

693
00:48:30,175 --> 00:48:31,542
And so I'm thinking,
well, what can it mean.

694
00:48:31,642 --> 00:48:33,979
I can go work for this
dude for something.

695
00:48:34,079 --> 00:48:35,546
If you looked at
Bob Berdella, he

696
00:48:35,646 --> 00:48:37,815
Didn't look... he
didn't look gay,

697
00:48:37,915 --> 00:48:39,850
So it wasn't even
nothing like going on.

698
00:48:39,951 --> 00:48:43,621
And at that time, I had the
choice to go... to get dropped

699
00:48:43,721 --> 00:48:46,724
Off, maybe, or to go that way.

700
00:48:46,824 --> 00:48:48,559
So unfortunately I
took the wrong way.

701
00:48:51,296 --> 00:48:54,565
Never met the man, thank God.

702
00:48:54,665 --> 00:48:59,137
Never needed to, to write
a song about him, at least.

703
00:48:59,237 --> 00:49:00,238
That's what I did back then.

704
00:49:00,338 --> 00:49:01,439
I was a radio guy.

705
00:49:01,539 --> 00:49:02,240
I was a disc jockey.

706
00:49:02,340 --> 00:49:03,541
I was irreverent.

707
00:49:03,641 --> 00:49:06,077
I was unfeeling.

708
00:49:06,177 --> 00:49:08,146
Whatever was funny
went on the radio.

709
00:49:08,246 --> 00:49:09,547
How did you feel
when you learned

710
00:49:09,647 --> 00:49:15,453
That not long after your arrest,
the local radio stations, two

711
00:49:15,553 --> 00:49:18,756
Of them at least, were running
a Bob Berdella parody song

712
00:49:18,856 --> 00:49:23,061
And were asking people come to
parties wearing dog collars?

713
00:49:23,161 --> 00:49:26,631
Well, I think the
newspaper article

714
00:49:26,731 --> 00:49:29,434
Reported that even the
families of the victims

715
00:49:29,534 --> 00:49:32,103
Were upset by the song.

716
00:49:32,203 --> 00:49:34,505
I have never had a
chance to hear the song.

717
00:49:34,605 --> 00:49:38,276
I was sitting at Antoine's on
the Boulevard, the old Tony's,

718
00:49:38,376 --> 00:49:40,411
And having lunch and
thinking that this

719
00:49:40,511 --> 00:49:42,313
Was such a huge
story in Kansas City

720
00:49:42,413 --> 00:49:43,814
That I had to write something.

721
00:49:43,914 --> 00:49:48,319
There was some song in the
classic rock era that would fit

722
00:49:48,419 --> 00:49:52,857
It perfectly, and I'll be
damned if I over a little $3.75

723
00:49:52,957 --> 00:49:56,194
Steak lunch figure out
"They call me Bob Berdella."

724
00:49:56,294 --> 00:49:58,929
Instead of "Mellow Yellow,"
it became "Bob Berdella."

725
00:49:59,030 --> 00:50:00,131
Everything just fit in.

726
00:50:00,231 --> 00:50:02,033
It had everything with
the bones in the backyard

727
00:50:02,133 --> 00:50:05,536
And the fluoroscope in the
basement and all the Polaroid

728
00:50:05,636 --> 00:50:08,473
Photographs that he had and
the hitchhikers and the dog

729
00:50:08,573 --> 00:50:12,143
Collars and the electric
shocks and the needles

730
00:50:12,243 --> 00:50:13,644
Sticking out of their necks.

731
00:50:13,744 --> 00:50:15,846
You had so much to write
from, you couldn't help

732
00:50:15,946 --> 00:50:17,782
But come up with something.

733
00:50:17,882 --> 00:50:20,385
(SINGING) They call
me Bob Berdella.

734
00:50:20,485 --> 00:50:22,220
That's right.

735
00:50:22,320 --> 00:50:24,722
They call me Bob Berdella.

736
00:50:24,822 --> 00:50:26,657
Do it again.

737
00:50:26,757 --> 00:50:28,559
They call me Bob Berdella.

738
00:50:28,659 --> 00:50:30,495
Don't stick that hand.

739
00:50:33,464 --> 00:50:35,700
I had also been told when
I first came into jail

740
00:50:35,800 --> 00:50:44,275
That the Fox radio station
had run a promo giving prizes

741
00:50:44,375 --> 00:50:45,743
To their listeners
if they showed

742
00:50:45,843 --> 00:50:50,915
Up at the station in a dog
collar and with a leash on.

743
00:50:51,015 --> 00:50:52,483
The people here in
the institution...

744
00:50:52,583 --> 00:50:55,720
The correctional
officers, the caseworker,

745
00:50:55,820 --> 00:50:59,090
Even the psychiatrist...
Were, I think,

746
00:50:59,190 --> 00:51:01,926
Surprised to find out
that that upset me.

747
00:51:02,026 --> 00:51:03,494
And it did upset you?

748
00:51:03,594 --> 00:51:05,096
Very much so.

749
00:51:05,196 --> 00:51:08,099
[Music playing]

750
00:51:14,639 --> 00:51:19,076
I had been in Ethiopia
the year before and I'd

751
00:51:19,177 --> 00:51:21,312
Gone through the camps and
I'd seen the dying children.

752
00:51:21,412 --> 00:51:22,347
I'd seen death.

753
00:51:22,447 --> 00:51:24,882
I'd seen evil in a
social sense, and I

754
00:51:24,982 --> 00:51:29,086
Had felt that somehow it
had a positive impact on me

755
00:51:29,187 --> 00:51:30,788
As a person.

756
00:51:30,888 --> 00:51:34,792
So I entered into
this arrangement

757
00:51:34,892 --> 00:51:37,295
With Bob in which I met with
him for an hour, hour and a half

758
00:51:37,395 --> 00:51:40,665
Twice a week, and I thought
I could handle anything.

759
00:51:40,765 --> 00:51:42,767
I didn't realize the impact.

760
00:51:42,867 --> 00:51:48,373
I was not able to eat, not
able to have sex, lost weight,

761
00:51:48,473 --> 00:51:51,776
Became extremely withdrawn
because I was dealing

762
00:51:51,876 --> 00:51:54,145
With stuff and then I was told
this is stuff you can't tell

763
00:51:54,245 --> 00:51:56,481
Other people about because
it's pretty... that's not

764
00:51:56,581 --> 00:51:57,615
The type of stuff
you could go out

765
00:51:57,715 --> 00:51:59,584
And say, hey, let me
tell you about what

766
00:51:59,684 --> 00:52:00,951
Bob and I talked about today.

767
00:52:01,051 --> 00:52:03,721
You had to keep it under wraps,
and that was the agreement.

768
00:52:03,821 --> 00:52:06,357
So my wife and I did
not talk about it.

769
00:52:06,457 --> 00:52:07,925
I didn't realize the
impact it was having

770
00:52:08,025 --> 00:52:11,028
Except over a period of time,
six months, I had gotten down

771
00:52:11,128 --> 00:52:16,301
And maybe lost 20
pounds and was just sort

772
00:52:16,401 --> 00:52:21,539
Of like a castaway that
had fallen on hard times

773
00:52:21,639 --> 00:52:24,475
And I was just skin and bones.

774
00:52:24,575 --> 00:52:28,446
After Berdella went to prison,
I got an interview with him.

775
00:52:28,546 --> 00:52:33,150
They put me in this
little tiny room with him.

776
00:52:33,251 --> 00:52:35,720
I asked them to take
the handcuffs off.

777
00:52:35,820 --> 00:52:38,189
I'm not sure why, but I did.

778
00:52:38,289 --> 00:52:40,558
He didn't seem very
threatening at that point.

779
00:52:40,658 --> 00:52:43,261
It's like all the air
had been let out of him.

780
00:52:43,361 --> 00:52:45,563
His condition was
that I bring two tape

781
00:52:45,663 --> 00:52:49,166
Recorders, one to tape the
interview for myself, one

782
00:52:49,267 --> 00:52:50,735
To give him a tape.

783
00:52:50,835 --> 00:52:54,905
I had to ask him how he got
by with some of this stuff

784
00:52:55,005 --> 00:52:56,774
Because there were
plenty of indications

785
00:52:56,874 --> 00:52:58,443
That there were
some nasty things

786
00:52:58,543 --> 00:52:59,810
Going on in Berdella's house.

787
00:52:59,910 --> 00:53:02,747
He told me that there were some
judges who would send people

788
00:53:02,847 --> 00:53:06,751
To him and that he
often bonded people out,

789
00:53:06,851 --> 00:53:10,388
And that for a while the
parole board had considered

790
00:53:10,488 --> 00:53:14,459
Him someone where they
could send troubled youth

791
00:53:14,559 --> 00:53:16,394
And young adults.

792
00:53:16,494 --> 00:53:19,196
I was recording
the conversation.

793
00:53:19,297 --> 00:53:23,301
After I left, the
tapes were confiscated

794
00:53:23,401 --> 00:53:29,073
And the warden called me and
informed me that something was

795
00:53:29,173 --> 00:53:30,608
Wrong with my tape
recorder because they

796
00:53:30,708 --> 00:53:33,711
Couldn't get the tape to play
after they'd confiscated it.

797
00:53:33,811 --> 00:53:36,714
I went to interview
Marcia Walsh.

798
00:53:36,814 --> 00:53:39,350
She'd just gotten back from
a trip to the Arctic Circle

799
00:53:39,450 --> 00:53:40,951
Where she'd been
saving baby seals.

800
00:53:43,688 --> 00:53:46,257
She really couldn't
tell me much about why

801
00:53:46,357 --> 00:53:48,826
She thought that Berdella
was a drug counselor

802
00:53:48,926 --> 00:53:51,596
Or that sort of thing.

803
00:53:51,696 --> 00:53:54,565
[Music playing]

804
00:55:06,170 --> 00:55:09,407
You recall I mentioned
before that there were reports

805
00:55:09,507 --> 00:55:13,043
In the Westport Flea Market
where you had your shop

806
00:55:13,143 --> 00:55:15,746
That people would
say, oh, yes, I

807
00:55:15,846 --> 00:55:19,984
Do remember he had these
strange-smelling dishes of

808
00:55:20,084 --> 00:55:24,221
Food, that he had bead bones.

809
00:55:24,321 --> 00:55:26,924
And later on there were
speculations, at least

810
00:55:27,024 --> 00:55:31,629
In the community and in
some aspects of the media,

811
00:55:31,729 --> 00:55:33,564
That the remains of
your victim were somehow

812
00:55:33,664 --> 00:55:36,200
Being transported
and prepared as meals

813
00:55:36,300 --> 00:55:38,335
And prepared as
jewelry in your shop.

814
00:55:38,436 --> 00:55:41,872
I was quickly able to
identify to the police

815
00:55:41,972 --> 00:55:45,275
The other dealers in that
section of the market where

816
00:55:45,376 --> 00:55:52,717
We rotated potluck, rather than
eat the flea market food again.

817
00:55:52,817 --> 00:55:55,420
And that you could question
any of these people,

818
00:55:55,520 --> 00:55:59,524
They'd be able to tell you
that the food was good,

819
00:55:59,624 --> 00:56:04,128
There was nothing suspect
about the turkey or ham or beef

820
00:56:04,228 --> 00:56:06,096
That was in these dishes.

822
00:56:24,048 --> 00:56:27,485
They were at the flea market
by Bob's Old Bazaar Bizarre.

823
00:56:27,585 --> 00:56:30,521
Bob was kind of a sick
guy who got a little too

824
00:56:30,621 --> 00:56:34,692
Into his hobbies, head hunting,
cannibalism, and cooking,

825
00:56:34,792 --> 00:56:38,162
And I think cooking
saved his life, actually.

[Music playing]

827

guy dabbling in cannibalism

In your small town.

829

scores of people.

lethal injection, though.

[Music playing]

838
00:57:54,805 --> 00:57:59,977
He would cut the bodies up
using his expertise as a chef

839
00:58:00,077 --> 00:58:02,279
And bring them out here
to the curb on Monday

window to make sure the trash

away, and that

842
00:58:09,654 --> 00:58:12,590
Was his method of disposing
of the bodies of the men

real landfill Louis.

To think that he put
pieces of a human being out

men to collect on Mondays

Is astounding.

All they had to do was catch
the scent of decomposing flesh

849
00:58:29,139 --> 00:58:33,110
Or look inside and realize that
there was a chopper inside.

out with trash.

The problems that would cause.

855
00:59:43,513 --> 00:59:46,316
How secure is that, to put
a body out on your curb

00:59:54,491 --> 00:59:55,492
Or hit by a car.

860
01:00:01,498 --> 01:00:04,434
He seems like a more careful
person to me than that.

861
01:00:04,534 --> 01:00:06,236
I believe it was the
police department who called

862
01:00:06,336 --> 01:00:08,572
And said that they needed us.

863
01:00:08,673 --> 01:00:11,508
They needed us to appraise a
piece of residential property

864
01:00:11,608 --> 01:00:14,011
That they can't
tell us what it is,

865
01:00:14,111 --> 01:00:16,546
But they'll have a car there
in five minutes to pick us up.

866
01:00:16,647 --> 01:00:19,416
We had no idea where we were
going or what we were doing.

867
01:00:19,516 --> 01:00:21,786
We end up at Bob
Berdella's house.

868
01:00:21,886 --> 01:00:23,287
Dining room had some
weird stuff in there...

869
01:00:23,387 --> 01:00:25,690
Coffee table with some
weird pictures on it

870
01:00:25,790 --> 01:00:29,293
And screaming faces,
that sort of thing.

871
01:00:29,393 --> 01:00:32,897
Vicious dogs in cages right
outside the back door.

872
01:00:32,997 --> 01:00:35,065
Huge dog kennels,
chain-link fence kennels.

873
01:00:35,165 --> 01:00:38,235
They weren't little dog runs
for Spot to run through.

874
01:00:38,335 --> 01:00:41,906
These were secured enclosures.

875
01:00:42,006 --> 01:00:44,408
They were not couch potato dogs.

876
01:00:44,508 --> 01:00:46,276
These were huge dogs.

877
01:00:46,376 --> 01:00:49,013
Kitchen was really strange.

878
01:00:49,113 --> 01:00:51,581
A couple big stainless
steel commercial tables.

879
01:00:51,682 --> 01:00:53,650
First you figure
out the guy could've

880
01:00:53,751 --> 01:00:54,785
Been a chef at a restaurant.

881
01:00:57,587 --> 01:01:00,657
I knew of Bob
Berdella, but didn't

882
01:01:00,758 --> 01:01:02,793
Know... nobody knew this stuff.

883
01:01:02,893 --> 01:01:04,962
So you thought, OK, he's
got dinner parties, caters.

884
01:01:05,062 --> 01:01:06,163
Who knows what?

885
01:01:06,263 --> 01:01:08,799
But then you look around
and it just wasn't right.

886
01:01:08,899 --> 01:01:10,100
It wasn't a normal kitchen.

887
01:01:10,200 --> 01:01:11,802
It wasn't a kitchen you
were going to entertain in.

888
01:01:11,902 --> 01:01:13,170
One of the stainless
steel tables

889
01:01:13,270 --> 01:01:19,209
Had built-in sinks and
this huge garbage disposal.

890
01:01:19,309 --> 01:01:23,113
It was a large... never seen a
garbage disposal that large.

891
01:01:23,213 --> 01:01:24,614
What the hell else is
he going to do with it?

892
01:01:24,715 --> 01:01:26,884
He's not going to grind
up lettuce in that thing.

893
01:01:26,984 --> 01:01:29,519
Basically the food or waste
enters from the top down

894
01:01:29,619 --> 01:01:31,488
Onto the grind plate, which
was spinning at the time

895
01:01:31,588 --> 01:01:33,557
The food enters the machine.

896
01:01:33,657 --> 01:01:38,328
The food is propelled by these
teeth here along the side,

897
01:01:38,428 --> 01:01:41,298
Or against the side rather,
of the shredder unit, which

898
01:01:41,398 --> 01:01:46,536
Pulverizes the waste, forcing it
through these cutting chambers

899
01:01:46,636 --> 01:01:50,040
Into the grind chamber where
the waste exits the machine.

900
01:01:50,140 --> 01:01:51,441
I don't know much
about human bones

901
01:01:51,541 --> 01:01:53,210
And what they look like when
they're out of the body,

902
01:01:53,310 --> 01:01:54,945
But I would figure
they'd be pretty large

903
01:01:55,045 --> 01:01:58,215
And as you can see, the grind
chamber's not exactly huge.

904
01:01:58,315 --> 01:02:00,150
So if you want a bone
to come down here,

905
01:02:00,250 --> 01:02:03,320
And let's say it was this
big, it lodges in here.

906
01:02:03,420 --> 01:02:06,490
Machine starts, it grabs
that bone, jams it real quick

907
01:02:06,590 --> 01:02:09,693
Because in this
area of the machine,

908
01:02:09,794 --> 01:02:11,495
It's not going to
grind that bone,

909
01:02:11,595 --> 01:02:12,930
Take it on, and rip it up.

910
01:02:13,030 --> 01:02:15,065
It's going to jam and stop.

911
01:02:15,165 --> 01:02:16,733
The flesh would not
be a problem at all.

912
01:02:16,834 --> 01:02:18,435
It would rip it up and
send it on down the drain

913
01:02:18,535 --> 01:02:22,172
Line pretty easily.

914
01:02:22,272 --> 01:02:27,211
I do see hospitals use them,
unfortunately, to grind things.

915
01:02:27,311 --> 01:02:30,781
I have seen some
labs use them to get

916
01:02:30,881 --> 01:02:33,984
Rid of tumors and whatnot.

[Suspenseful music playing]

Men will go to any
length to get head

919
01:03:58,435 --> 01:03:59,703
Is my only comment on this.

920
01:04:03,140 --> 01:04:07,811
You said, "I want the police
to explain why they allow"

to die in the convenient area

"Of 10th and McGee."

923
01:04:13,017 --> 01:04:16,186
I don't think any
family of my victims

924
01:04:16,286 --> 01:04:20,790
Or anybody else that has
been killed, related to 10th

925
01:04:20,891 --> 01:04:25,095
And McGee are going to be happy
to find out that their loved

926
01:04:25,195 --> 01:04:29,699
One is basically written
off by the police

927
01:04:29,799 --> 01:04:33,270
As far as investigations go,
et cetera, because they died

928
01:04:33,370 --> 01:04:34,671
In a convenient neighborhood.

929
01:04:34,771 --> 01:04:38,442
The police knew what was
going on, so it's no big deal.

930
01:04:38,542 --> 01:04:40,410
And that accounts
for your remark to me,

931
01:04:40,510 --> 01:04:42,279
And I don't mean at
all to make light of it

932
01:04:42,379 --> 01:04:44,881
That "I killed six,
but they, the police",

By allowing this to stay
open, they killed more."

934
01:04:47,517 --> 01:04:49,186
Yes, this has been
something that's

935
01:04:49,286 --> 01:04:52,656
Been going on for over
20 years to my knowledge.

936
01:04:52,756 --> 01:04:57,594
It seems to me that you're
suggesting that had the police

937
01:04:57,694 --> 01:05:01,165
Done their job, had they
followed the leads, had they

938
01:05:01,265 --> 01:05:08,238
Really been on your case
prior to April 2, 1988,

939
01:05:08,338 --> 01:05:11,108
They would've caught you
and some of the suffering

940
01:05:11,208 --> 01:05:12,242
Could have been prevented.

941
01:05:12,342 --> 01:05:16,046
Maybe not caught me...
Scared me off, maybe.

942
01:05:16,146 --> 01:05:21,485
Prevented things from happening
after Howell, definitely.

943
01:05:21,585 --> 01:05:23,087
In a way, do you wish they had?

944
01:05:23,187 --> 01:05:24,488
Yes.

945
01:05:24,588 --> 01:05:26,823
Well, it was the police's fault
because they should've caught

946
01:05:26,923 --> 01:05:30,360
Me, or they should
stop having all

947
01:05:30,460 --> 01:05:33,663
Those attractive little
boys down there tempting me,

01:05:33,763 --> 01:05:37,667
It was like nothing has
anything to do with... he

949
01:05:37,767 --> 01:05:39,436
Had no responsibility at all.

950
01:05:39,536 --> 01:05:42,006
It was just like,
well, I was on a diet

951
01:05:42,106 --> 01:05:43,773
But you kept shoving
food down my throat.

952
01:05:43,873 --> 01:05:44,874
It's like, oh, OK.

953
01:05:47,844 --> 01:05:52,149
Six victims for a serial killer
over a four-year period is low.

954
01:05:52,249 --> 01:05:56,620
Generally their urge to kill is
much more frequently than that,

955
01:05:56,720 --> 01:05:59,089
But I think that
Berdella was a hoarder.

956
01:05:59,189 --> 01:06:01,558
He spent a lot of
time with his victims.

957
01:06:01,658 --> 01:06:05,162
He needed his residence
to house them.

958
01:06:05,262 --> 01:06:07,164
He needed a safe
house to perform

959
01:06:07,264 --> 01:06:09,766
His hideous experiments,
so I don't see him

963
01:06:17,941 --> 01:06:19,143
I don't see him as
that kind of guy.

964
01:06:19,243 --> 01:06:21,478
I think six may be the total.

965
01:06:21,578 --> 01:06:22,979
That question was
always there and I

966
01:06:23,080 --> 01:06:24,348
Was always being asked that.

967
01:06:24,448 --> 01:06:29,386
I have no specific information
that there were other victims

968
01:06:29,486 --> 01:06:31,021
That could have been.

969
01:06:31,121 --> 01:06:33,890
At times I had some
thoughts that might've been,

970
01:06:33,990 --> 01:06:37,027
But Bob certainly never
indicated that he had

971
01:06:37,127 --> 01:06:40,464
Misled anyone in his testimony.

972
01:06:40,564 --> 01:06:43,800
Personally I believe there
were only six victims.

973
01:06:43,900 --> 01:06:48,372
A lot of people
disagree with that.

974
01:06:48,472 --> 01:06:50,240
I think one of the
things that convinces

975
01:06:50,340 --> 01:06:53,810
Me is the fact that Berdella
had already cut a deal,

976
01:06:53,910 --> 01:06:55,745
So his punishment was
not going to be any

977
01:06:55,845 --> 01:06:58,382
Different if it were 6 or 60.

978
01:06:58,482 --> 01:07:01,985
When you look at the
research on serial killers,

979
01:07:02,086 --> 01:07:04,354
They don't kill fewer
people over time.

980
01:07:04,454 --> 01:07:07,424
They go up, and he went down.

981
01:07:11,395 --> 01:07:14,164

they would find two skulls.

983
01:07:19,769 --> 01:07:21,538
He collects everything.

If you look at those
search warrants,

985
01:07:23,107 --> 01:07:26,042
This man didn't
throw anything away,

986
01:07:26,143 --> 01:07:32,416
So why would you keep two skulls
and then just load every bit

987
01:07:32,516 --> 01:07:35,085
Of every other body up
and put it out on the curb

988
01:07:35,185 --> 01:07:36,820
For the trash to pick up?

989
01:07:41,158 --> 01:07:45,495

I can tell you what
led up to the escape.

Like I said, the first couple
days, I was unconscious

993
01:08:05,582 --> 01:08:08,452
And I couldn't
really see nothing.

994
01:08:08,552 --> 01:08:10,254

my eyesight was coming

this dude had up his sleeve,

credit for anything.

before and he would again.

Get away, could you tie them?

from... took them down from here

01:09:43,613 --> 01:09:46,350
I knew that I'd get them
off, but it wasn't the time.

1028
01:09:46,450 --> 01:09:47,717
I didn't know.

1029
01:09:47,817 --> 01:09:49,919
So I was going to do it, at
that point... on the fourth day,

1030
01:09:50,019 --> 01:09:52,956
I had planned for the fifth
day I was going to do it

1031
01:09:53,056 --> 01:09:56,226
The next day, he went ahead
with the regular schedule.

1032
01:09:56,326 --> 01:09:57,026
He did everything.

1033
01:10:00,930 --> 01:10:03,700
Asked me if I had to go to
the bathroom, and I said no.

1034
01:10:03,800 --> 01:10:05,068
While I was talking
to him, he had

1035
01:10:05,168 --> 01:10:07,471
Some matches because he always
used to give me a cigarette

1036
01:10:07,571 --> 01:10:10,707
Right before he left.

1037
01:10:10,807 --> 01:10:14,143
He smoked a cigarette and he
always took the matches away,

1038
01:10:14,244 --> 01:10:16,713
And he was standing there and
he threw them down this time

1039
01:10:16,813 --> 01:10:18,214
By the table.

1040
01:10:18,315 --> 01:10:20,617
I kept his attention
talking to him,

1041
01:10:20,717 --> 01:10:23,753
Why he didn't run to pick
the matches up again.

1042
01:10:23,853 --> 01:10:25,855
I don't know why, but
that's what happened.

1043
01:10:25,955 --> 01:10:29,125
I already knew I was
going to have to burn

1044
01:10:29,225 --> 01:10:30,860
The ropes with the matches.

1045
01:10:30,960 --> 01:10:33,397
So after I got them
loose, I couldn't

1046
01:10:33,497 --> 01:10:36,199
Reach down to touch
my feet, with it,

1047
01:10:36,300 --> 01:10:38,234
But there was the bedpost.

1048
01:10:38,335 --> 01:10:42,639
There was a metal bedpost and
I was so freaked out in my head

1049
01:10:42,739 --> 01:10:45,675
That I thought he had
boobytrapped the metal.

1050
01:10:45,775 --> 01:10:46,643
You know what I'm saying?

1051
01:10:46,743 --> 01:10:47,977
I actually thought
I was going to get

1052
01:10:48,077 --> 01:10:50,179
Shocked or electrocuted if I
would try to test the metal.

1053
01:10:50,280 --> 01:10:51,214
That is why I burned the ropes.

1054
01:10:54,418 --> 01:10:55,552
And so I got that loose.

1055
01:10:55,652 --> 01:10:58,087
It was just like a fast panic.

1056
01:10:58,187 --> 01:10:59,523
I didn't know shit
about the window

1057
01:10:59,623 --> 01:11:03,126
Because the window was
covered by a big picture.

1058
01:11:03,226 --> 01:11:04,461
I didn't know if it
was going to open.

1059
01:11:04,561 --> 01:11:06,463
I didn't know if
he was downstairs.

1060
01:11:06,563 --> 01:11:07,831
I didn't know how
much time I had.

1061
01:11:07,931 --> 01:11:10,867
I really didn't even know how
high I was up or anything,

1062
01:11:10,967 --> 01:11:12,736
Or I surely would have
tried to look for my clothes

1063
01:11:12,836 --> 01:11:15,071
Before I went out.

1064
01:11:15,171 --> 01:11:16,673
The fear... once
I knew that I had

1065
01:11:16,773 --> 01:11:19,008
Committed to untying
the ropes, I just

1066
01:11:19,108 --> 01:11:21,177
Knew it was all or nothing.

1067
01:11:21,277 --> 01:11:24,948
And so the adrenaline
building, man.

1068
01:11:25,048 --> 01:11:28,752
I just got up,
raised the window,

1069
01:11:28,852 --> 01:11:30,820
And I was happy that
it came all the way up.

1070
01:11:30,920 --> 01:11:32,389
And I looked down.

1071
01:11:32,489 --> 01:11:35,692
All I remember seeing a dog dish
right there below on the side

1072
01:11:35,792 --> 01:11:37,661
And I was thinking, damn,
I'm going to jump down there

1073
01:11:37,761 --> 01:11:41,598
And get attacked by these dogs.

1074
01:11:41,698 --> 01:11:45,435
So I crawl out and I'm hanging.

1075
01:11:45,535 --> 01:11:47,637
I was going to try to
jump over to the fence.

1076
01:11:47,737 --> 01:11:50,674
The next yard appeared to be
about this far on the sidewalk.

1077
01:11:50,774 --> 01:11:52,742
It was all divided.

1078
01:11:52,842 --> 01:11:56,713
I was going to jump over to
the next... where the grass was.

1079
01:11:56,813 --> 01:11:59,516
I was going to try to
get a little sway going

1080
01:11:59,616 --> 01:12:02,719
And jump over
there, but the ledge

1081
01:12:02,819 --> 01:12:06,122
Broke and I fell straight down.

1082
01:12:06,222 --> 01:12:07,857
I hurt my leg a little bit,
but that wasn't nothing.

1083
01:12:07,957 --> 01:12:09,826
I dove over the fence.

1084
01:12:09,926 --> 01:12:13,597
I wasn't thinking about
being naked or nothing.

1085
01:12:13,697 --> 01:12:16,099
I was out of there.

1086

[Music playing]

1087
01:12:35,652 --> 01:12:40,056
(SINGING) Bobby, why not?

1088
01:12:40,156 --> 01:12:43,527
If I'd only turned
left instead of right.

1089
01:12:43,627 --> 01:12:47,030
Why you, the unlucky ones.

1090
01:12:47,130 --> 01:12:50,534
Could you have put
a better fight?

1091
01:12:50,634 --> 01:12:53,503
I'm Lazarus.

1092
01:12:53,603 --> 01:12:55,004
I'm back, boys.

1093
01:12:55,104 --> 01:12:59,008
What'd I miss while I was gone?

1094
01:12:59,108 --> 01:13:01,010
I'm in a mood.

1095
01:13:01,110 --> 01:13:02,479
I got my life back.

1096
01:13:02,579 --> 01:13:03,480
Hell, I even have my own song.

1097
01:13:23,066 --> 01:13:24,468
Yeah, I guess some
of us are just lucky.

1098
01:13:27,671 --> 01:13:28,438
I'm the one that got away.

1099
01:13:32,542 --> 01:13:35,912
Even an old, gay, broken
watch is right twice a day.

1100
01:13:39,015 --> 01:13:41,017
I'm Lazarus.

1101
01:13:41,117 --> 01:13:43,887
I'm the phoenix.

1102
01:13:43,987 --> 01:13:46,823
It's not my time to go.

1103
01:13:46,923 --> 01:13:51,360
So sit back, but don't relax.

1104
01:13:51,461 --> 01:13:52,261
Enjoy the rest of the show.

1105
01:14:06,676 --> 01:14:08,512
Are you saying you feel
remorse or that you've

1106
01:14:08,612 --> 01:14:10,179
Been misunderstood?

1107
01:14:10,279 --> 01:14:13,617
I'm not going to sit here
with my finger to my chin

1108
01:14:13,717 --> 01:14:16,853
And say nobody understands me.

1109
01:14:16,953 --> 01:14:19,489
Yes, there has been
a lot of remorse.

1110
01:14:19,589 --> 01:14:22,659
And he may well feel remorse,
but he has the remorse

1111
01:14:22,759 --> 01:14:25,662
Of a crook that got caught.

1112
01:14:25,762 --> 01:14:27,531
Aw, poor Bobby.

1113
01:14:27,631 --> 01:14:29,065
The world grieves for you.

1114
01:14:29,165 --> 01:14:35,539
The world reads that excerpt
from WH Auden's poem,

1115
01:14:35,639 --> 01:14:37,006
And I forget the title.

1116
01:14:37,106 --> 01:14:41,110
Maybe it's his most famous
poem, "September 1, 1939."

1117
01:14:41,210 --> 01:14:42,411
It goes something like this...

1118
01:14:42,512 --> 01:14:45,281
"I and the public know what
all schoolchildren learn,

1119
01:14:45,381 --> 01:14:48,552
Those to whom evil is
done Do evil and return."

1120
01:14:48,652 --> 01:14:51,254
Well, maybe somebody gave you a
few whacks in the head when you

1121
01:14:51,354 --> 01:14:53,056
Were a kid, but I
doubt if you were

1122
01:14:53,156 --> 01:14:55,158
Systematically
terrorized the way

1123
01:14:55,258 --> 01:14:56,860
You terrorized your victims.

1124
01:14:56,960 --> 01:14:59,195
You deserve no sympathy.

1125
01:15:02,131 --> 01:15:03,900
[Bell chiming]

1126
01:15:05,201 --> 01:15:07,871
There was a report in the
Sunday Kansas City Star

1127
01:15:07,971 --> 01:15:10,506
In December about
the dangers you

1128
01:15:10,607 --> 01:15:13,943
Might face after you
leave the Jackson County

1129
01:15:14,043 --> 01:15:17,413
Correctional Facility
and are moved

1130
01:15:17,513 --> 01:15:21,084
To another, larger prison.

1131
01:15:21,184 --> 01:15:22,586
How do you feel about
reports like that?

1132
01:15:22,686 --> 01:15:23,419
Do they make you anxious?

1133
01:15:26,255 --> 01:15:28,457
They give me some
reason for concern,

1134
01:15:28,558 --> 01:15:30,359
But one of the
reasons I'm concerned

1135
01:15:30,459 --> 01:15:34,163
Is that these were
not just reports.

1136
01:15:34,263 --> 01:15:39,803
These were digging out quotes
from unnamed prosecutors,

1137
01:15:39,903 --> 01:15:42,972
Implying that the inmates
down there are waiting

1138
01:15:43,072 --> 01:15:44,608
To get their hands on me.

1139
01:15:47,877 --> 01:15:53,817
I am at this point less
concerned about the inmates

1140
01:15:53,917 --> 01:16:00,423
Acting on their own as opposed
to the inmates... inmate...

1141
01:16:00,523 --> 01:16:07,263
Acting in response to maybe
some directive or coercion

1142
01:16:07,363 --> 01:16:09,065
From some police officers.

1143
01:16:09,165 --> 01:16:11,367
You think you're
being set up, perhaps?

1144
01:16:11,467 --> 01:16:15,304
Well, I think the Star and
Times since they haven't been

1145
01:16:15,404 --> 01:16:18,441
Able to get a court
to put me to death

1146
01:16:18,541 --> 01:16:22,078
Are now trying to get the
inmates to do it for them.

1147
01:16:22,178 --> 01:16:25,782
In a sense, he was killed
by the prison system.

1148
01:16:25,882 --> 01:16:27,383
I don't make those
kind of judgments,

1149
01:16:27,483 --> 01:16:31,420
And it would be like
a death sentence

1150
01:16:31,520 --> 01:16:33,957
That the prison system
probably took on

1151
01:16:34,057 --> 01:16:36,826
Instead of the judicial system.

1152
01:16:36,926 --> 01:16:41,264
But I wouldn't say
that was fitting.

1153
01:16:41,364 --> 01:16:45,869
According to his parents, his
mom, they withheld medication

1154
01:16:45,969 --> 01:16:48,838
And he died of a heart attack.

1155
01:16:48,938 --> 01:16:53,376
So the question was put to me by
several people who Bob had told

1156
01:16:53,476 --> 01:16:55,244
He was going to give
the complete story to

1157
01:16:55,344 --> 01:16:57,914
And were visiting him in prison,
didn't give the complete story

1158
01:16:58,014 --> 01:17:01,851
To, caught me and asked me
if I would lead an effort

1159
01:17:01,951 --> 01:17:04,854
To call for an
investigation and to condemn

1160
01:17:04,954 --> 01:17:08,257
The prison system for their
lack of responsiveness

1161
01:17:08,357 --> 01:17:09,826
To Ma's medication.

1162
01:17:09,926 --> 01:17:12,095
I did not do that.

1163
01:17:12,195 --> 01:17:14,964
It's not something at that
time I was willing to do, take

1164
01:17:15,064 --> 01:17:20,837
On the role of challenging
the prison system,

1165
01:17:20,937 --> 01:17:23,139
Because I could
understand in some ways

1166
01:17:23,239 --> 01:17:25,675
How Bob got himself in
that situation... very

1167
01:17:25,775 --> 01:17:32,615
Demanding, very difficult
in terms of trying

1168
01:17:32,716 --> 01:17:35,819
To make others feel
very small and himself

1169
01:17:35,919 --> 01:17:37,186
Being very important.

1170
01:17:37,286 --> 01:17:40,757
And I'm just guessing that the
guards in the prison system

1171
01:17:40,857 --> 01:17:43,626
Just said, you're not
going to control us.

1172
01:17:43,727 --> 01:17:47,663
And they withheld the
medication and he died.

1173
01:17:47,764 --> 01:17:54,103
I think probably unfortunate
because I don't think

1174
01:17:54,203 --> 01:17:58,474
He had in return for his life
given the testimony to Al

1175
01:17:58,574 --> 01:18:01,644
Riederer and admitted
what he'd done,

1176
01:18:01,745 --> 01:18:04,547
And so that guaranteed
him life in prison,

1177
01:18:04,647 --> 01:18:08,284
And it's not up to us
to make those decisions.

1178
01:18:08,384 --> 01:18:11,554
It should have been done.

1179
01:18:11,654 --> 01:18:13,923
What I said was at
the time that I thought

1180
01:18:14,023 --> 01:18:18,027
That even though he wasn't given
the death penalty, number one,

1181
01:18:18,127 --> 01:18:20,029
He would go to prison
for the rest of his life.

1182
01:18:20,129 --> 01:18:22,098
And number two, he'd die in
prison a lot sooner than he

1183
01:18:22,198 --> 01:18:23,499
Would if he were executed.

1184
01:18:23,599 --> 01:18:26,402
In Missouri, it takes us about
10 years to execute somebody.

1185
01:18:26,502 --> 01:18:28,204
I don't know how long
he was in prison,

1186
01:18:28,304 --> 01:18:30,306
But probably about six
years before he died.

1187
01:18:34,410 --> 01:18:35,478
And why?

1188
01:18:35,578 --> 01:18:39,916
I believe that was simply
that his behavior was

1189
01:18:40,016 --> 01:18:45,554
So uncontrollable and was
so bad towards anybody,

1190
01:18:45,654 --> 01:18:47,156
Towards everybody
that he encountered.

1191
01:18:47,256 --> 01:18:49,926
I just assumed that he
would do something in jail

1192
01:18:50,026 --> 01:18:51,194
That would get him killed.

1193
01:18:51,294 --> 01:18:53,997
Now, he died of a heart attack.

1194
01:18:54,097 --> 01:18:54,798
Was he murdered?

1195
01:18:54,898 --> 01:18:57,033
I don't know.

1196
01:18:57,133 --> 01:18:58,001
He got what he deserved.

1197
01:19:01,971 --> 01:19:04,974
I don't know how you
put an end to all that,

1198
01:19:05,074 --> 01:19:06,442
But the truth of
the matter is if you

1199
01:19:06,542 --> 01:19:09,545
Go back and look at the
facts, that's how he ended up.

1200
01:19:09,645 --> 01:19:12,782
He ended up getting
what he deserved.

1201
01:19:12,882 --> 01:19:16,119
It's really too bad that he
didn't live longer than he did

1202
01:19:16,219 --> 01:19:20,824
Because I think he was
getting... he was a control freak

1203
01:19:20,924 --> 01:19:25,461
And people were losing
interest in him.

1204
01:19:25,561 --> 01:19:28,965
And I think that had he lived,
sooner or later he would've

1205
01:19:29,065 --> 01:19:29,833
Given up more information.

1206
01:19:32,701 --> 01:19:34,437
I don't think he
could've helped himself.

1207
01:19:34,537 --> 01:19:39,608
I think he wanted the attention.

1208
01:19:39,708 --> 01:19:43,079
And you know the whole story
about how he died in jail.

1209
01:19:43,179 --> 01:19:44,313
Well, I don't know
the whole story.

1210
01:19:44,413 --> 01:19:45,581
I just know he died
of heart attack.

1211
01:19:45,681 --> 01:19:48,952
But the story everybody was
telling was that, OK, he

1212
01:19:49,052 --> 01:19:50,854
Probably was asking
for more potato chips

1213
01:19:50,954 --> 01:19:52,521
And he was cussing
out some guard,

1214
01:19:52,621 --> 01:19:55,058
And then he's like, oh, guard.

1215
01:19:55,158 --> 01:19:56,359
They're like, oh,
yeah, we'll be there.

They just let him die.

It's like everybody
was like, well,

1219
01:20:01,464 --> 01:20:02,431
And they had to pay extra.

1220
01:20:02,531 --> 01:20:03,833
Supposedly they had
to pay extra to keep

1221
01:20:03,933 --> 01:20:07,904
Him isolated because
everybody would've

1222

NEWS REPORTER: Just

Is all that's left
of 4315 Charlotte,

1240

But some people will
never forget the house,

1241

Nor the man who lived here.

1242
01:21:35,391 --> 01:21:38,627
Bob Berdella, Kansas City's
most infamous serial killer,

1243
01:21:38,727 --> 01:21:39,628
Is dead.

1244
01:21:39,728 --> 01:21:41,830
He died in prison
after his victims

1245
01:21:41,931 --> 01:21:43,499
Were killed in his home.

1246
01:21:43,599 --> 01:21:45,935
Berdella confessed to
sexually and physically

1247
01:21:46,035 --> 01:21:50,639
Torturing six men here, but some
believe there were more victims

1248

And hope digging up the house
might unearth some secrets.

1249
01:21:54,143 --> 01:21:57,646
That's why millionaire Del
Dunmire, who owns the property,

1250
01:21:57,746 --> 01:22:00,016
Had workers carefully
tear it down.

Private detective Ashley
Hurn was here in 1988

1252
01:22:03,652 --> 01:22:05,354
When the truth
came out, and he's

1253
01:22:05,454 --> 01:22:07,423
Been here for the
past five weeks

1254
01:22:07,523 --> 01:22:09,993
Making sure no other
bodies turned up.

1255
01:22:10,093 --> 01:22:13,096
He says the stairs to the
basement will be saved,

1256
01:22:13,196 --> 01:22:15,965
As well as this
drain, reportedly used

1257
01:22:16,065 --> 01:22:18,634
To carry away the blood
of Berdella's victims.

1258
01:22:18,734 --> 01:22:21,704
Well, this appears to be the
final chapter of the Berdella

1259
01:22:21,804 --> 01:22:23,372
Story, and no one
could be happier

1260
01:22:23,472 --> 01:22:25,141
Than those who live
on either side,

1261
01:22:25,241 --> 01:22:26,709
Who will split the property.

1262
01:22:30,913 --> 01:22:36,185
I did not see any attempt
of clergy, any attempt

1263
01:22:36,285 --> 01:22:40,756
Of politicians, attorneys,
police, to ever try and wrap

1264
01:22:40,856 --> 01:22:44,160
That up and say, here's what
happened, here's what it means,

1265
01:22:44,260 --> 01:22:46,062
Here's what we've
learned from it.

1266
01:22:46,162 --> 01:22:48,464
I guess I kind of
got obsessed with it.

1267
01:22:48,564 --> 01:22:53,969
I think a lot of us
did... me, the lawyers,

1268
01:22:54,070 --> 01:22:56,072
The other reporters, everybody.

1269
01:23:00,243 --> 01:23:03,479
And it was difficult
to let go of the case,

1270
01:23:03,579 --> 01:23:07,383
And at a certain point, I
just decided that's exactly

1271
01:23:07,483 --> 01:23:09,418
What I needed to do.

1272
01:23:09,518 --> 01:23:17,826
So I gathered boxes, boxes
of documents and notes

1273
01:23:17,926 --> 01:23:23,232
And tape-recorded interviews,
and one day I just took

1274
01:23:23,332 --> 01:23:25,368
All that, loaded
it up in the car,

1275
01:23:25,468 --> 01:23:30,673
And drove out to the city
landfill and dumped it.

1276
01:23:30,773 --> 01:23:34,277
When there are pieces of the
puzzle, put them together.

1277
01:23:36,912 --> 01:23:41,250
Facts don't diminish the myth
because we need the stories

1278
01:23:41,350 --> 01:23:44,420
And we even need the
stories of the "bad people"

1279
01:23:44,520 --> 01:23:46,922
As much as we need the
stories of the good people.

1280
01:23:47,022 --> 01:23:49,658
We need our heroes and
we need our villains,

1281
01:23:49,758 --> 01:23:56,632
And so the myth becomes the
real story then, not the facts.

1282
01:23:56,732 --> 01:24:01,904

it, but you get obsessed.

think you can see that it kind

1286
01:24:10,446 --> 01:24:12,148
Of just sort of keeps going.

be quiet, be cautious,

if you're gay men and women.

01:28:33,275 --> 01:28:35,878
Say it one more time, get you.

1363
01:28:35,978 --> 01:28:37,380
Get your ya-ya's here.

1364
01:28:37,480 --> 01:28:38,347
What?

1365
01:28:38,447 --> 01:28:39,582
That's another
song, that's right.

1366
01:28:39,682 --> 01:28:40,383
Bob the Bogeyman.

1367
01:28:44,953 --> 01:28:47,255
Bob the Bogeyman.

1368
01:28:47,356 --> 01:28:48,757
Who?

1369
01:28:48,857 --> 01:28:50,659
Bob the Bogeyman.

1370
01:28:50,759 --> 01:28:51,460
He's Bob the Bogeyman.

1371
01:28:56,365 --> 01:29:00,202
He's Bob the Bogey, the
Bogey, the Bogeyman.
