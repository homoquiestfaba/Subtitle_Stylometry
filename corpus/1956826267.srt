1
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:32,004
WWII unleashed

2
00:01:32,204 --> 00:01:35,527
Nazi Germany, involved in its

3
00:01:35,727 --> 00:01:39,051
the orbit of more than 60 states with

4
00:01:39,251 --> 00:01:42,574
population of 1.7 billion people.

5
00:01:42,774 --> 00:01:46,098
4/5 of humanity.

6
00:01:46,298 --> 00:01:49,621
All Central Europe turned out to be

7
00:01:49,821 --> 00:01:53,145
under the misfortune of German fascism.

8
00:01:53,345 --> 00:01:56,668
German troops irresistibly rushed to the east.

9
00:01:56,868 --> 00:02:00,191
Red army seeing bloody

10
00:02:00,391 --> 00:02:03,715
defensive battles, retreated

11
00:02:03,915 --> 00:02:07,238
to Moscow. Here the enemy was stopped

12
00:02:07,438 --> 00:02:14,285
and discarded. The year 1942 has come.

13
00:02:14,485 --> 00:02:17,809
The warring parties were preparing for a decisive

14
00:02:18,009 --> 00:02:20,180
summer campaign.

15
00:02:30,098 --> 00:02:31,895
Mr. Lieutenant

16
00:02:33,489 --> 00:02:35,179
I recorded someone else's transmitter.

17
00:02:35,379 --> 00:02:37,372
The transfer was from Berlin.

18
00:02:38,481 --> 00:02:40,153
It cannot be.

19
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,953
In Berlin, someone else's transmitter!

20
00:02:42,153 --> 00:02:43,125
You messed up something.

21
00:02:43,325 --> 00:02:44,997
I also recorded the beta X callsigns.

22
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:48,075
Mr. Reichsführer,

23
00:02:48,278 --> 00:02:49,773
I must inform you.

24
00:02:49,973 --> 00:02:51,015
Radio interception service

25
00:02:51,215 --> 00:02:52,789
found enemy lines in our rear

26
00:02:52,989 --> 00:02:54,914
shortwave radio station. These pianists ...

27
00:02:55,114 --> 00:02:56,129
What other pianists?

28
00:02:57,184 --> 00:02:59,309
So they are called the counterintelligence service.

29
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:02,203
These pianists work in Berlin,

30
00:03:02,403 --> 00:03:03,528
Amsterdam and Geneva.

31
00:03:03,957 --> 00:03:06,734
What is reported in intercepted telegrams?

32
00:03:06,934 --> 00:03:08,343
Mr. Reichsführer,

33
00:03:08,543 --> 00:03:10,586
telegram radio unfortunately for now

34
00:03:10,786 --> 00:03:12,036
cannot be decrypted.

35
00:03:13,043 --> 00:03:16,442
I order you to catch the pianists immediately!

36
00:03:38,379 --> 00:03:40,750
You probably already know Bock?

37
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:43,793
What did I take command of the ground forces?

38
00:03:44,364 --> 00:03:48,286
And I called you to appoint the commander of the Army Group South.

39
00:03:48,684 --> 00:03:51,301
But I could not take to Moscow, my Fuhrer.

40
00:03:51,817 --> 00:03:54,043
We will not recall the past.

41
00:03:55,262 --> 00:03:58,570
Tips will be next summer

42
00:03:58,770 --> 00:04:02,164
defeated. I mean while in the center

43
00:04:02,364 --> 00:04:04,453
front no longer conduct offensive

44
00:04:04,653 --> 00:04:07,192
operations. My goal will be

45
00:04:07,442 --> 00:04:09,223
offensive on the southern front.

46
00:04:10,059 --> 00:04:13,536
I decided to concentrate all the main forces

47
00:04:13,825 --> 00:04:16,817
and take a strike in the direction of the Caucasus.

48
00:04:17,645 --> 00:04:20,114
This is the most important area.

49
00:04:20,622 --> 00:04:22,700
Need to go to the Caucasian oil.

50
00:04:24,309 --> 00:04:27,957
Haver, report the plan of Operation Blau.

51
00:04:37,903 --> 00:04:42,364
My Fuhrer, the basis of the operation plan. "Blau" -

52
00:04:42,918 --> 00:04:46,793
rapid turn of large tank forces from Voronezh

53
00:04:47,106 --> 00:04:48,106
to the south.

54
00:04:49,395 --> 00:04:52,609
The tanks have to move at maximum speeds along.

55
00:04:52,809 --> 00:04:55,676
Don, then to Stalingrad.

56
00:04:56,973 --> 00:04:59,895
And connecting with the Kharkov group,

57
00:05:01,067 --> 00:05:02,067
tread on the Caucasus.

58
00:05:04,325 --> 00:05:08,434
At the same time, an imitation of the attack on Moscow is being conducted.

59
00:05:09,012 --> 00:05:12,067
It will be a camouflage operation called the Kremlin.

60
00:05:12,911 --> 00:05:16,036
Using all methods of misinformation.

61
00:05:17,692 --> 00:05:22,082
As long as the Russian command understands that the strike was not delivered to Moscow, but to the south,

62
00:05:23,168 --> 00:05:24,422
all tasks on

63
00:05:24,622 --> 00:05:26,961
surrounding and eliminating the southern group

64
00:05:27,161 --> 00:05:29,000
Soviet troops will be executed.

65
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:31,054
When you can do it

66
00:05:31,684 --> 00:05:34,239
a path to the Caucasus will open before us.

67
00:05:36,247 --> 00:05:41,481
And then in front of us is India. The main thing,

68
00:05:41,707 --> 00:05:45,653
move south faster. And at the same time

69
00:05:45,934 --> 00:05:48,702
to forge Russian reserves at Moscow.

70
00:05:49,254 --> 00:05:52,468
In no case do not touch the 70 divisions that are in

71
00:05:52,668 --> 00:05:53,984
center. - But, my Fuhrer ...

72
00:05:54,184 --> 00:05:57,203
Take troops before Operation Blau

73
00:05:57,403 --> 00:06:00,739
wherever you want. All of our allies.

74
00:06:02,309 --> 00:06:05,973
70 divisions in the center should all the time

75
00:06:06,622 --> 00:06:10,645
hang like a sword of Damocles over Moscow.

76
00:06:14,629 --> 00:06:16,179
Allow to apply.

77
00:06:16,379 --> 00:06:17,859
Oberleutenant Schulzeboisen,

78
00:06:18,059 --> 00:06:21,047
Harro, if you remember. Well then

79
00:06:21,247 --> 00:06:23,278
Harro, I haven't seen you in a long time.

80
00:06:23,614 --> 00:06:25,997
And how is your father, my dear Erich?

81
00:06:26,442 --> 00:06:28,817
Father is now participating in the blockade of England.

82
00:06:29,067 --> 00:06:31,140
In his letters, he always asks to convey greetings to you.

83
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:33,754
Thank you Mr. Field Marshal

84
00:06:33,965 --> 00:06:36,445
were you now at the Fuhrer and received new appointments?

85
00:06:36,645 --> 00:06:38,843
Yes, I have been appointed commander of the Army Group South.

86
00:06:39,043 --> 00:06:40,757
Congratulations, Mr. Field Marshal.

87
00:06:40,957 --> 00:06:42,357
I have a personal request for you:

88
00:06:43,926 --> 00:06:46,297
I serve at the air force headquarters

89
00:06:46,497 --> 00:06:49,789
and I want to transfer to the army in order to participate in the offensive.

90
00:06:49,989 --> 00:06:51,109
But Reich Marshal Bering

91
00:06:51,309 --> 00:06:54,789
doesn’t let me go, he says that the order to deploy troops will not be soon.

92
00:06:54,989 --> 00:06:56,140
Hurry up my friend

93
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:59,184
you need to be in time no later than May. Good luck!

94
00:06:59,395 --> 00:07:01,411
Thank you Mr. Field Marshal!

95
00:08:08,898 --> 00:08:10,679
What is there?

96
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:14,379
Can not hear anything. It's too early.

97
00:08:37,848 --> 00:08:39,918
Anxiety! Turn off the radio.

98
00:08:40,997 --> 00:08:43,262
What happened? Look - a raid.

99
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,098
Give me the transmitter.

100
00:08:56,442 --> 00:08:58,192
And bring the best suitcase.

101
00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:01,437
You can’t transfer more from Berlin.

102
00:09:01,637 --> 00:09:04,911
Last time. It is very important.

103
00:09:34,372 --> 00:09:37,273
This night, Harro Schulzeboisen

104
00:09:37,473 --> 00:09:40,161
transferred to the center. To the director:

105
00:09:40,457 --> 00:09:41,461
Troop deployment for

106
00:09:41,661 --> 00:09:45,059
offensive in the Caucasus will happen by May 1

107
00:09:45,262 --> 00:09:47,339
1942 year.

108
00:09:48,911 --> 00:09:51,036
According to intelligence information from Germany,

109
00:09:52,504 --> 00:09:55,637
large forces of Nazi troops

110
00:09:56,504 --> 00:09:57,817
focus

111
00:09:58,856 --> 00:10:00,414
in the southern section

112
00:10:00,614 --> 00:10:03,953
Soviet-German front. Not every

113
00:10:04,153 --> 00:10:06,184
intelligence data can be trusted.

114
00:10:07,997 --> 00:10:11,442
Report better how the General Staff regards

115
00:10:12,176 --> 00:10:15,153
our plans for the summer of 42 years?

116
00:10:17,465 --> 00:10:18,367
As for our plans

117
00:10:18,567 --> 00:10:21,714
42 years for spring and summer,

118
00:10:23,176 --> 00:10:26,598
the General Staff believes that we still do not have enough forces and means,

119
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:28,242
to expand

120
00:10:28,442 --> 00:10:30,042
major offensive operations.

121
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:33,450
In the near future should be limited

122
00:10:34,387 --> 00:10:38,309
active strategic defense.

123
00:10:40,129 --> 00:10:43,411
But do not sit on the defensive

124
00:10:44,075 --> 00:10:46,148
and wait for the Germans to strike

125
00:10:46,348 --> 00:10:48,599
first? Excuse me, comrade Stalin?

126
00:10:51,715 --> 00:10:53,965
Southwest troops entrusted to me

127
00:10:54,707 --> 00:10:56,257
now able to inflict on the Germans

128
00:10:56,457 --> 00:10:57,457
preemptive strike.

129
00:10:58,325 --> 00:11:00,039
It's about a major offensive operation

130
00:11:00,239 --> 00:11:01,632
with the release of our troops on

131
00:11:01,832 --> 00:11:04,293
Gomel-Kiev line. Oh you!

132
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:06,606
Look where you swung!

133
00:11:12,223 --> 00:11:13,637
And what does Zhukov think?

134
00:11:17,090 --> 00:11:18,920
I believe that at present we cannot

135
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,170
carry out a major offensive operation.

136
00:11:21,872 --> 00:11:23,072
This requires reserves,

137
00:11:24,067 --> 00:11:25,817
which you hold, comrade Stalin.

138
00:11:26,747 --> 00:11:29,222
Reserves are needed for the defense of Moscow!

139
00:11:32,106 --> 00:11:33,106
Sit down.

140
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:38,317
And a larger group

141
00:11:39,606 --> 00:11:42,481
German troops. 70 divisions!

142
00:11:43,879 --> 00:11:46,770
Located in the Moscow direction.

143
00:11:48,676 --> 00:11:50,245
It gives us the right

144
00:11:50,981 --> 00:11:53,090
to believe that with the onset of summer

145
00:11:53,606 --> 00:11:54,989
the enemy will try to inflict

146
00:11:55,222 --> 00:11:56,996
crushing blow

147
00:11:57,597 --> 00:11:59,762
It is in the central direction.

148
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:04,122
Agent messages from Germany

149
00:12:04,981 --> 00:12:06,761
smell of disinformation.

150
00:12:08,153 --> 00:12:09,809
I support the opinion.

151
00:12:10,090 --> 00:12:11,918
Boris Mikhailovich Shaposhnikov

152
00:12:12,864 --> 00:12:15,684
about active strategic defense, but

153
00:12:16,269 --> 00:12:19,250
along with this one needs to draw a number

154
00:12:19,450 --> 00:12:20,650
offensive operations.

155
00:12:22,981 --> 00:12:25,458
We must agree with the proposal Tymoshenko

156
00:12:27,090 --> 00:12:29,695
and strike at the Kharkov group

157
00:12:29,895 --> 00:12:33,257
the enemy. Thank you for your trust, Comrade Stalin.

158
00:12:33,457 --> 00:12:36,325
Conduct the operation in cash.

159
00:12:37,254 --> 00:12:38,286
And keep in mind:

160
00:12:39,207 --> 00:12:40,489
You will not receive reserves!

161
00:12:52,606 --> 00:12:56,070
Coming to Kharkov without additional reserves is a doomed business.

162
00:12:56,270 --> 00:12:57,270
Why not you

163
00:12:57,528 --> 00:12:59,378
nor did Shaposhnikov tell him about this?

164
00:13:00,309 --> 00:13:02,676
Useless business. Did you see his face?

165
00:13:03,207 --> 00:13:05,793
And from intelligence messages from Germany too

166
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,200
quickly dismissed.

167
00:13:17,887 --> 00:13:21,211
May 12, 1942

168
00:13:21,411 --> 00:13:24,734
troops of the southwestern front went on the offensive.

169
00:13:24,934 --> 00:13:28,257
They broke through the enemy's defenses and advanced to

170
00:13:28,457 --> 00:13:31,957
50 km in the direction of Kharkov.

171
00:13:39,028 --> 00:13:45,875
May 17, in 11 divisions of Field Marshal von Bock

172
00:13:46,075 --> 00:13:49,398
flanked the attacking forces

173
00:13:49,598 --> 00:13:53,098
southwestern front.

174
00:14:21,934 --> 00:14:22,934
Comrade Stalin,

175
00:14:23,582 --> 00:14:26,480
the situation on the southwestern front is critical.

176
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:28,695
Urgent need to stop

177
00:14:28,895 --> 00:14:30,340
attack on Kharkov.

178
00:14:32,786 --> 00:14:35,114
I talked to the marshal. Tymoshenko.

179
00:14:35,957 --> 00:14:36,859
He considers,

180
00:14:37,059 --> 00:14:38,659
that the offensive must continue.

181
00:14:40,872 --> 00:14:41,872
Comrade Stalin,

182
00:14:42,551 --> 00:14:45,256
I again ask you to stop the offensive.

183
00:14:45,997 --> 00:14:48,520
There was a threat to the environment.

184
00:14:54,934 --> 00:14:57,067
Connect me with. Khrushchev.

185
00:14:57,559 --> 00:14:59,183
Hello, comrade Stalin.

186
00:14:59,801 --> 00:15:01,379
There are serious concerns.

187
00:15:02,566 --> 00:15:04,629
And should the operation be stopped?

188
00:15:05,090 --> 00:15:06,090
Comrade Stalin,

189
00:15:06,379 --> 00:15:08,229
measures taken by the command,

190
00:15:08,997 --> 00:15:10,703
will be sufficient to reflect

191
00:15:10,903 --> 00:15:12,230
hit from the flank.

192
00:15:12,911 --> 00:15:16,292
But because, I think, there is no reason to stop the operation.

193
00:15:16,832 --> 00:15:18,769
Continue the offensive.

194
00:15:29,031 --> 00:15:33,390
Khrushchev! I am a lily of the valley!

195
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:36,914
I am a lily of the valley! Please allow the departure.

196
00:15:37,114 --> 00:15:44,137
Please allow the departure! I turn to the reception.

197
00:15:47,684 --> 00:15:51,184
They are silent, scum!

198
00:16:32,356 --> 00:16:34,270
Wait!

199
00:17:15,223 --> 00:17:16,223
Wait!

200
00:17:21,325 --> 00:17:22,375
What's going on here?

201
00:17:25,129 --> 00:17:27,395
Yes, we shoot cowards.

202
00:17:27,825 --> 00:17:29,145
The Germans left machine guns.

203
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:33,840
Don't kill us.

204
00:17:35,512 --> 00:17:36,512
We will redeem.

205
00:17:38,168 --> 00:17:39,168
I redeem.

206
00:17:40,786 --> 00:17:41,786
Untie their hands.

207
00:17:44,668 --> 00:17:45,723
You have no right!

208
00:17:46,473 --> 00:17:47,825
I am the head of a special department.

209
00:17:48,114 --> 00:17:50,157
And I am a member of the military council of the front.

210
00:17:50,879 --> 00:17:53,161
I need soldiers for World War II.

211
00:17:55,044 --> 00:17:56,044
Shoot a little!

212
00:17:57,137 --> 00:17:58,137
Get on the tank!

213
00:17:59,598 --> 00:18:00,898
Please note, I will complain.

214
00:18:08,379 --> 00:18:09,379
On the table.

215
00:18:11,614 --> 00:18:12,707
Why on the table?

216
00:18:14,168 --> 00:18:17,036
Your bone is sticking out. And around inflamed.

217
00:18:18,473 --> 00:18:20,033
If I regret your foot -

218
00:18:21,489 --> 00:18:22,989
you will die of gas gangrene.

219
00:18:27,645 --> 00:18:29,981
I’ll shoot you all to mother’s unit!

220
00:18:30,809 --> 00:18:32,559
Send me to Moscow immediately!

221
00:18:33,450 --> 00:18:37,135
How dare you! What's your last name?

222
00:18:38,575 --> 00:18:41,262
Khrushchev. Senior Lieutenant Khrushchev.

223
00:18:41,942 --> 00:18:43,469
I order to send me immediately

224
00:18:43,669 --> 00:18:44,778
to Moscow.

225
00:19:01,129 --> 00:19:04,304
Serious defeat of Russian troops in the rayon of Kharkov

226
00:19:04,504 --> 00:19:06,906
dramatically changed the balance of power on

227
00:19:07,106 --> 00:19:09,825
the entire southern wing of the eastern front.

228
00:19:11,536 --> 00:19:13,820
Events are developing in full compliance

229
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:17,192
with the general plan of the supreme command.

230
00:19:18,528 --> 00:19:21,028
We are close to our main task.

231
00:19:21,457 --> 00:19:24,254
The implementation of the general offensive

232
00:19:24,692 --> 00:19:27,127
Operation Blau.

233
00:19:28,973 --> 00:19:31,648
For the main operation

234
00:19:31,848 --> 00:19:37,286
99 divisions of 1260 tanks are involved

235
00:19:37,973 --> 00:19:40,731
and more than 1,600 combat aircraft.

236
00:19:42,809 --> 00:19:45,129
Our tank wedges

237
00:19:45,614 --> 00:19:47,164
crash into the location of the enemy,

238
00:19:47,364 --> 00:19:50,348
like a hot knife into a piece of butter.

239
00:19:53,848 --> 00:19:56,856
But Russians should not know anything.

240
00:19:57,129 --> 00:19:59,703
Operational orders to transmit only

241
00:19:59,903 --> 00:20:04,020
orally. For violations - the death penalty.

242
00:20:07,255 --> 00:20:11,531
Gestapo and Abwehr head

243
00:20:11,731 --> 00:20:14,028
responsible for maintaining secrecy.

244
00:20:15,543 --> 00:20:18,934
Before the operation "Blau" the rear must be cleaned

245
00:20:19,801 --> 00:20:21,364
from enemy spies.

246
00:20:23,637 --> 00:20:24,875
Direction finding service

247
00:20:25,075 --> 00:20:26,731
detected transmitters

248
00:20:26,942 --> 00:20:27,929
in Prague, Zurich,

249
00:20:28,129 --> 00:20:29,801
Bruges, Amsterdam, Brussels.

250
00:20:31,364 --> 00:20:34,500
In search of radio stations used intelligence

251
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:37,650
aircraft. They flew over cities equipped with direction finders.

252
00:20:39,910 --> 00:20:41,722
So far, unfortunately, without results.

253
00:20:44,317 --> 00:20:47,012
Attract the best forensic experts in Germany.

254
00:20:47,731 --> 00:20:49,125
In Brussels, Bruges, Amsterdam

255
00:20:49,325 --> 00:20:52,047
keep your people in every police station.

256
00:20:52,247 --> 00:20:54,661
Check all residents of these cities.

257
00:20:55,043 --> 00:20:57,379
Act, Gidding, act, immediately!

258
00:21:04,739 --> 00:21:05,836
After

259
00:21:06,036 --> 00:21:08,551
a mysterious chapel brought pure coincidence.

260
00:21:09,098 --> 00:21:11,054
Happening. Which was previously explained

261
00:21:11,254 --> 00:21:12,504
divine providence.

262
00:21:15,161 --> 00:21:17,809
Can I speak with the police commissioner?

263
00:21:18,418 --> 00:21:19,918
He's not in now.

264
00:21:20,848 --> 00:21:22,307
What happened to you?

265
00:21:22,637 --> 00:21:26,132
You see, I'm Karl Lawns. The businessman.

266
00:21:26,332 --> 00:21:29,762
I live on the street of Atreboty, house 101.

267
00:21:30,379 --> 00:21:32,590
Two French women live in a neighboring apartment.

268
00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:34,590
And you understand

269
00:21:35,043 --> 00:21:37,590
we began to notice that these girls

270
00:21:38,059 --> 00:21:40,137
men often visit.

271
00:21:40,950 --> 00:21:42,100
My wife said bluntly:

272
00:21:42,457 --> 00:21:43,757
Maybe at our side

273
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:45,200
stash of debauchery?

274
00:21:45,957 --> 00:21:47,422
What, these girls bother you so much?

275
00:21:47,622 --> 00:21:49,547
We are devout Catholics

276
00:21:49,747 --> 00:21:51,125
and we cannot put up

277
00:21:51,325 --> 00:21:52,791
with immoral acts.

278
00:21:53,481 --> 00:21:55,086
Somewhere in the raion of the boulevard

279
00:21:55,286 --> 00:21:56,286
transmitter.

280
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:57,875
We need to seize the opportunity and

281
00:21:58,075 --> 00:21:59,176
to inspect this house.

282
00:22:00,473 --> 00:22:03,828
You said: 101 Atrebota Street? - So

283
00:22:04,028 --> 00:22:05,028
exactly.

284
00:22:06,223 --> 00:22:09,586
Good. We will check what your

285
00:22:09,786 --> 00:22:10,786
French women

286
00:22:22,426 --> 00:22:23,426
Stay here.

287
00:22:31,442 --> 00:22:33,059
Who you are?

288
00:23:10,747 --> 00:23:14,543
I am Sophie Poznanska, French. From Bordeaux.

289
00:23:17,028 --> 00:23:18,411
On what basis

290
00:23:18,918 --> 00:23:21,002
did you break into our apartment at night?

291
00:23:21,770 --> 00:23:22,770
Documents!

292
00:23:29,692 --> 00:23:31,562
What are you French?

293
00:23:31,762 --> 00:23:33,361
You can’t connect two words.

294
00:23:34,911 --> 00:23:38,205
Who are you? Can you speak German?

295
00:23:40,426 --> 00:23:43,122
Well, do not want to answer questions -

296
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:45,377
we'll talk tomorrow.

297
00:23:49,629 --> 00:23:50,629
Documents!

298
00:23:51,879 --> 00:23:53,215
I do not know anything.

299
00:23:53,473 --> 00:23:55,797
I just performed the duties of a housewife -

300
00:23:55,997 --> 00:23:57,239
cooked and washed floors.

301
00:23:57,512 --> 00:23:59,736
I don’t know anything, honestly!

302
00:24:04,973 --> 00:24:07,065
Bring Poznansk to me.

303
00:24:11,293 --> 00:24:13,364
What is the name of the radio operator?

304
00:24:13,817 --> 00:24:17,304
I do not know his last name. He came sometimes

305
00:24:17,504 --> 00:24:18,531
stayed overnight

306
00:24:18,731 --> 00:24:20,950
and then sat at the transmitter until morning.

307
00:24:22,848 --> 00:24:25,801
Do you know anything more about him? Nothing.

308
00:24:28,512 --> 00:24:32,762
Mr. Hauptsturmführer, arrested by Sophie Poznanska, committed suicide.

309
00:24:33,012 --> 00:24:34,012
What?

310
00:24:35,606 --> 00:24:38,098
I opened the veins with a splinter of glass.

311
00:24:54,325 --> 00:24:56,289
She knew too much and

312
00:24:56,489 --> 00:24:57,489
preferred death.

313
00:25:01,504 --> 00:25:03,832
Decrypted the radiogram of the radio operator?

314
00:25:05,004 --> 00:25:06,004
Not.

315
00:25:06,911 --> 00:25:08,239
But among the columns of numbers

316
00:25:08,692 --> 00:25:10,700
There are two unencrypted radiograms.

317
00:25:11,247 --> 00:25:12,750
They set out some kind of plan.

318
00:25:12,950 --> 00:25:15,965
"Blau" - an operation to seize Stalingrad and the Caucasus.

319
00:25:16,614 --> 00:25:17,614
What?

320
00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:23,129
It can't be! This is a catastrophe!

321
00:25:23,942 --> 00:25:25,359
Enemy

322
00:25:25,559 --> 00:25:28,489
penetrated the most secret secrets of high command.

323
00:25:29,832 --> 00:25:31,520
How to report to the Fuhrer now?

324
00:25:32,950 --> 00:25:36,692
What does Abwehr do? Imperial security.

325
00:25:37,082 --> 00:25:38,746
Where is the counterintelligence?

326
00:25:39,653 --> 00:25:42,914
If the tribunals are not able to fight betrayal, I

327
00:25:43,114 --> 00:25:44,179
I will find a remedy.

328
00:25:44,379 --> 00:25:47,750
I won’t tolerate being hindered victoriously

329
00:25:47,950 --> 00:25:50,051
end the war with the Bolsheviks!

330
00:25:58,989 --> 00:25:59,843
In future

331
00:26:00,043 --> 00:26:02,036
about the actions of the enemy in our rear

332
00:26:02,387 --> 00:26:03,926
to report to me personally.

333
00:26:07,543 --> 00:26:10,442
Postpone the operation of Blau.

334
00:26:12,903 --> 00:26:15,809
Bok, think about disguising the operation.

335
00:26:17,637 --> 00:26:18,867
But the whole summer’s plan

336
00:26:19,067 --> 00:26:20,926
campaigns cannot be changed!

337
00:26:23,356 --> 00:26:24,700
Main strike

338
00:26:26,184 --> 00:26:27,184
to prepare

339
00:26:28,161 --> 00:26:30,002
no later than the end of June.

340
00:26:35,168 --> 00:26:36,992
You fly short

341
00:26:37,192 --> 00:26:38,664
way across the front line.

342
00:26:38,864 --> 00:26:42,187
Our aviation in this sector has a complete advantage in the air.

343
00:26:42,387 --> 00:26:44,023
But there may be anti-aircraft batteries.

344
00:26:44,223 --> 00:26:47,340
The Russians do not shoot well, Major.

345
00:26:47,684 --> 00:26:49,539
No hesitation, Reichel.

346
00:26:49,739 --> 00:26:52,265
Major Reichel's portfolio was lying

347
00:26:52,465 --> 00:26:55,789
false intelligence prepared by German intelligence

348
00:26:55,989 --> 00:27:03,012
the beginning of the offensive on June 22, 1942.

349
00:27:16,017 --> 00:27:19,447
Battery, fire!

350
00:27:25,776 --> 00:27:28,945
Pilots, seize pilots!

351
00:27:29,145 --> 00:27:31,340
Faster, Faster!

352
00:27:32,636 --> 00:27:36,136
Wait!

353
00:27:46,551 --> 00:27:48,567
Intercepted enemy documents

354
00:27:48,864 --> 00:27:51,531
no doubt. Airplane apparently

355
00:27:51,731 --> 00:27:52,797
lost orientation

356
00:27:52,997 --> 00:27:55,707
fell into the scope of our anti-aircraft artillery

357
00:27:56,145 --> 00:27:57,408
and was shot down.

358
00:27:58,473 --> 00:28:01,418
An officer with the rank of major tried to hide.

359
00:28:01,887 --> 00:28:04,028
But he was killed in a shootout.

360
00:28:04,715 --> 00:28:07,565
In our estimation, the enemy’s plan is as follows:

361
00:28:08,551 --> 00:28:11,051
The enemy seeks to defeat

362
00:28:11,582 --> 00:28:15,684
to our flank armies. We know

363
00:28:16,457 --> 00:28:20,184
your assessment of the situation. Your

364
00:28:20,801 --> 00:28:22,286
and comrade Khrushchev,

365
00:28:22,981 --> 00:28:24,431
leading to a serious error.

366
00:28:26,582 --> 00:28:28,903
If we told the country

367
00:28:29,590 --> 00:28:32,661
about that disaster with the loss of 20 divisions,

368
00:28:33,450 --> 00:28:35,567
that the southwestern front survived,

369
00:28:36,653 --> 00:28:39,457
then you would be very cool.

370
00:28:41,059 --> 00:28:44,440
I warn you about liability.

371
00:28:45,411 --> 00:28:48,575
June 22, 1942

372
00:28:49,707 --> 00:28:52,856
exactly according to the term of the captured order,

373
00:28:53,325 --> 00:28:55,453
German Army Group South

374
00:28:55,653 --> 00:29:01,036
start an attack on its right flank.

375
00:29:19,028 --> 00:29:20,122
My Fuehrer,

376
00:29:20,989 --> 00:29:23,215
day and night, not fading, there are heavy fighting.

377
00:29:24,223 --> 00:29:26,629
Heavy fights? It's good.

378
00:29:27,512 --> 00:29:29,078
So the disguise worked.

379
00:29:29,278 --> 00:29:31,515
The Russians were waiting for our offensive and

380
00:29:31,715 --> 00:29:34,707
pulled up reserves here. Now gentlemen

381
00:29:34,942 --> 00:29:37,044
the time comes for Operation Blau.

382
00:29:38,004 --> 00:29:39,965
We will start her

383
00:29:41,059 --> 00:29:43,236
June 28th.

384
00:29:59,072 --> 00:30:04,453
June 28, 1942 Wehrmacht inflicted

385
00:30:04,653 --> 00:30:07,976
its main strike on the left flank of the southern front.

386
00:30:08,176 --> 00:30:11,500
The one in deep secret

387
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:15,023
prepared, the Blau plan.

388
00:30:15,223 --> 00:30:18,547
In the battle, both sides acted

389
00:30:18,747 --> 00:30:20,914
over 2 million soldiers.

390
00:30:21,114 --> 00:30:26,479
More than 2 thousand tanks. 2 thousand aircraft.

391
00:31:14,815 --> 00:31:18,289
Soviet troops with heavy battles

392
00:31:18,489 --> 00:31:21,989
retreated to Stalingrad.

393
00:31:49,911 --> 00:31:51,533
Ah, Kuzma!

394
00:31:52,629 --> 00:31:53,629
Are you here?

395
00:31:54,364 --> 00:31:56,164
I came to my previous position.

396
00:31:58,082 --> 00:31:59,359
Member of the military council

397
00:31:59,559 --> 00:32:00,609
southwestern front.

398
00:32:03,645 --> 00:32:06,364
The southwestern front is disbanded.

399
00:32:07,684 --> 00:32:09,924
Instead, Stalingrad was created.

400
00:32:11,269 --> 00:32:13,511
I am appointed a member of the military council.

401
00:32:17,137 --> 00:32:21,153
Instead of you. There probably played

402
00:32:22,075 --> 00:32:23,425
that you were surrounded.

403
00:32:26,122 --> 00:32:27,596
Yes, I was surrounded.

404
00:32:29,372 --> 00:32:31,590
And withdrew many troops. And you know it!

405
00:32:33,926 --> 00:32:34,968
And the environment, by the way,

406
00:32:35,168 --> 00:32:36,168
it might not be.

407
00:32:37,114 --> 00:32:38,086
If you correctly assessed the situation,

408
00:32:38,286 --> 00:32:40,559
and then hit the hornet’s nest right!

409
00:32:41,489 --> 00:32:43,723
Everyone was waiting for the German blow to Moscow, and

410
00:32:43,957 --> 00:32:45,007
he deceived us again!

411
00:32:45,911 --> 00:32:48,361
What time is it already! “How dare you say that?”

412
00:32:49,926 --> 00:32:50,926
You're a commissioner!

413
00:32:53,434 --> 00:32:55,034
The Supreme takes all decisions.

414
00:32:55,903 --> 00:32:56,953
Do not you discuss them.

415
00:33:06,512 --> 00:33:08,817
The Germans took it. Lower Chirk.

416
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:10,520
Did they take the Church Church?

417
00:33:11,614 --> 00:33:12,714
How will we report?

418
00:33:15,504 --> 00:33:16,504
I will plunge.

419
00:33:24,434 --> 00:33:26,145
Come on.

420
00:33:37,262 --> 00:33:38,572
HF comrade Stalin.

421
00:33:42,778 --> 00:33:44,228
Hello, comrade Stalin.

422
00:33:44,739 --> 00:33:46,478
The situation is difficult, comrade Stalin.

423
00:33:47,559 --> 00:33:51,533
The enemy continues to develop the offensive with superior forces.

424
00:33:51,747 --> 00:33:53,926
However, the main goal of the enemy is

425
00:33:54,293 --> 00:33:55,683
surround and destroy

426
00:33:56,192 --> 00:33:58,598
troops of the front west of the Don, not reached.

427
00:33:59,817 --> 00:34:01,457
Our troops are moving along the lines.

428
00:34:02,739 --> 00:34:03,849
What milestones?

429
00:34:04,887 --> 00:34:09,715
Are you snoring? Give the territory? And the population?

430
00:34:10,622 --> 00:34:11,856
And try it

431
00:34:12,528 --> 00:34:14,809
pass off as high military art?

432
00:34:16,700 --> 00:34:20,590
Where is Tymoshenko? Tymoshenko? He is swimming.

433
00:34:22,770 --> 00:34:24,462
Where? - In a river.

434
00:34:25,981 --> 00:34:27,408
Pass on Tymoshenko

435
00:34:28,582 --> 00:34:30,101
that he is suspended from

436
00:34:30,301 --> 00:34:32,101
command of the Stalingrad Front.

437
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:47,793
The order we must take today

438
00:34:49,293 --> 00:34:53,250
what number, comrade Shcherbakov? 227,

439
00:34:53,450 --> 00:34:54,450
comrade Stalin.

440
00:34:55,872 --> 00:34:56,872
Write.

441
00:34:59,668 --> 00:35:00,668
Enemy

442
00:35:02,817 --> 00:35:04,103
throws to the front

443
00:35:06,192 --> 00:35:07,192
all new forces and,

444
00:35:09,489 --> 00:35:12,801
regardless of losses, creeps forward.

445
00:35:13,129 --> 00:35:15,484
And some stupid people on

446
00:35:15,684 --> 00:35:18,645
front console themselves with talk about

447
00:35:19,122 --> 00:35:22,575
that we can continue to retreat east.

448
00:35:24,090 --> 00:35:26,689
The territory of the Soviet state -

449
00:35:28,356 --> 00:35:29,712
it is not a desert.

450
00:35:31,762 --> 00:35:33,642
Retreat further -

451
00:35:34,856 --> 00:35:38,767
means ruining our homeland.

452
00:35:39,223 --> 00:35:40,223
I have to write.

453
00:35:41,543 --> 00:35:43,408
All army commanders,

454
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:47,150
corps and division commanders,

455
00:35:48,598 --> 00:35:50,002
admitted

456
00:35:50,950 --> 00:35:52,408
unauthorized withdrawal of troops,

457
00:35:53,769 --> 00:35:56,036
will be put on trial by a military tribunal!

458
00:35:59,997 --> 00:36:04,390
Lead detachments from the troops.

459
00:36:04,590 --> 00:36:06,184
NKVD with machine guns.

460
00:36:07,809 --> 00:36:09,872
All fleeing the battlefield

461
00:36:11,270 --> 00:36:12,783
alarmists and cowards

462
00:36:14,051 --> 00:36:16,697
must be shot on the spot.

463
00:36:18,012 --> 00:36:20,379
Presidium of the Supreme Council of the SSR

464
00:36:20,832 --> 00:36:23,101
for courage and bravery shown in battles

465
00:36:23,301 --> 00:36:25,720
at the front of World War II,

466
00:36:26,176 --> 00:36:28,668
awards the order. Red banner

467
00:36:29,223 --> 00:36:32,548
captain. Ruben Ruiz Ibarrudi.

468
00:36:41,606 --> 00:36:45,348
Captain Ruben Ruiz Ibarruri is Spanish.

469
00:36:46,277 --> 00:36:47,757
The son of the general

470
00:36:47,957 --> 00:36:50,195
Secretary of the Communist Party of Spain.

471
00:36:50,395 --> 00:36:51,395
Dolores Ibarruri.

472
00:36:52,786 --> 00:36:54,234
We also invited him today to

473
00:36:54,434 --> 00:36:55,707
she was present

474
00:36:56,426 --> 00:36:58,759
while rewarding his brave son

475
00:36:59,239 --> 00:37:01,017
internationalist,

476
00:37:02,145 --> 00:37:04,679
who fights for Soviet freedom

477
00:37:04,879 --> 00:37:05,879
people.

478
00:37:06,997 --> 00:37:07,997
I ask you.

479
00:37:15,856 --> 00:37:19,356
I congratulate you on your hero son.

480
00:37:23,848 --> 00:37:26,684
But we will live! For a life!

481
00:37:35,903 --> 00:37:38,848
Sorry if this is not a military secret.

482
00:37:39,598 --> 00:37:40,598
Are you an infantryman?

483
00:37:41,997 --> 00:37:43,478
Yes, because an infantryman -

484
00:37:44,996 --> 00:37:46,622
this is the most masculine of all

485
00:37:46,822 --> 00:37:49,699
professions. It’s not for nothing that they say

486
00:37:50,293 --> 00:37:54,328
that infantry - infantry - is the queen of the fields.

487
00:37:54,528 --> 00:37:55,562
Aviation - Queen of the Sky, Artillery -

488
00:37:55,762 --> 00:37:56,872
god of War.

489
00:37:58,551 --> 00:38:00,931
The generals came up with all these comparisons.

490
00:38:01,762 --> 00:38:03,681
So to speak, create romance.

491
00:38:06,135 --> 00:38:08,736
But in fact, all this cannon fodder.

492
00:38:10,737 --> 00:38:12,915
What gloomy jokes, Lenya? What are you

493
00:38:13,534 --> 00:38:16,487
Do you want to ruin the whole mood? Yes?

494
00:38:17,143 --> 00:38:18,293
Do you want me to sing a song?

495
00:38:19,166 --> 00:38:23,576
Good one. Spanish! The real one? Spanish?

496
00:38:23,776 --> 00:38:25,126
We sang it in our village.

497
00:40:20,565 --> 00:40:22,744
Watch how it walks. And they wanted to tickle!

498
00:40:23,612 --> 00:40:24,812
Surgeons are very fond of this.

499
00:40:25,088 --> 00:40:28,494
How did you convince them? I had an argument.

500
00:40:30,143 --> 00:40:33,362
Here he is. The most important. Well, show me.

501
00:40:34,424 --> 00:40:36,404
Scouts presented. Walter.

502
00:40:36,604 --> 00:40:39,869
He will kill a fly from 30 meters. So.

503
00:40:42,659 --> 00:40:43,849
Come on, let's shoot.

504
00:40:44,049 --> 00:40:45,599
Never fired from Walter.

505
00:40:46,697 --> 00:40:52,159
And what? Let's go baw! Let's go to!

506
00:41:02,166 --> 00:41:03,166
Look.

507
00:41:07,041 --> 00:41:08,213
Sniper shot.

508
00:41:12,276 --> 00:41:13,276
Like this.

509
00:41:24,877 --> 00:41:27,697
Shoot me. I need courage.

510
00:41:28,346 --> 00:41:29,932
I'm going to the front.

511
00:41:32,237 --> 00:41:33,237
No, guys.

512
00:41:36,135 --> 00:41:39,409
Are you scared? Shoot, don’t be afraid.

513
00:41:39,619 --> 00:41:40,869
Well, how small are you?

514
00:41:43,448 --> 00:41:44,463
And I'm not afraid.

515
00:41:45,776 --> 00:41:47,135
Boys, what are you doing?

516
00:41:55,377 --> 00:41:57,573
It was an accident, Comrade Stalin.

517
00:41:58,252 --> 00:41:59,518
For youth and stupidity.

518
00:42:00,580 --> 00:42:02,283
Punishment, of course, should be

519
00:42:03,557 --> 00:42:05,017
but still it’s Khrushchev’s son,

520
00:42:05,971 --> 00:42:07,271
member of the military council of Stalingrad

521
00:42:07,471 --> 00:42:08,471
front.

522
00:42:10,877 --> 00:42:12,541
Give to the military tribunal.

523
00:42:15,338 --> 00:42:17,744
Maybe postpone the sentence

524
00:42:18,799 --> 00:42:20,658
until the end of the battle of Stalingrad?

525
00:42:28,643 --> 00:42:30,807
Colonel General Eremenko arrived.

526
00:42:31,659 --> 00:42:32,659
Let him come in.

527
00:42:36,127 --> 00:42:37,127
I beg.

528
00:42:39,979 --> 00:42:40,979
Wait a minute.

529
00:42:42,276 --> 00:42:43,611
Leave your wand.

530
00:42:44,557 --> 00:42:45,557
And come on in.

531
00:42:55,330 --> 00:42:58,030
Colonel General Eremenko arrived at your order.

532
00:43:00,119 --> 00:43:03,033
So you think you got better?

533
00:43:03,284 --> 00:43:05,502
So sure, healed. So-so.

534
00:43:07,237 --> 00:43:09,885
And when he walks, he limps.

535
00:43:10,838 --> 00:43:12,419
Please do not worry, everything is in order with me.

536
00:43:12,619 --> 00:43:13,769
The bones have grown together perfectly.

537
00:43:14,252 --> 00:43:17,932
Well, we assume that Comrade Eremenko returned to duty.

538
00:43:18,541 --> 00:43:19,541
Let's get down to business.

539
00:43:21,580 --> 00:43:23,826
They say the first imperialist

540
00:43:24,026 --> 00:43:28,099
You stabbed the war in a bayonet attack 22

541
00:43:28,299 --> 00:43:29,299
person?

542
00:43:29,846 --> 00:43:31,746
22 enemy soldiers, Comrade Stalin.

543
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:35,448
And the hand did not flinch? No, comrade Stalin.

544
00:43:36,143 --> 00:43:40,198
It's good. Cruelty. - the right quality.

545
00:43:40,596 --> 00:43:42,189
For the front commander.

546
00:43:48,573 --> 00:43:49,573
Near Stalingrad

547
00:43:50,002 --> 00:43:51,822
difficult situation.

548
00:43:54,784 --> 00:43:56,471
Urgent action needed

549
00:43:57,549 --> 00:43:58,826
to strengthen this responsible

550
00:43:59,026 --> 00:44:00,697
section of the front.

551
00:44:01,963 --> 00:44:04,900
We want to entrust this to you.

552
00:44:06,073 --> 00:44:07,223
How do you look at it?

553
00:44:08,135 --> 00:44:09,052
Ready to serve wherever

554
00:44:09,252 --> 00:44:10,729
consider it necessary to send.

555
00:44:11,690 --> 00:44:12,690
You are wasting time.

556
00:44:13,252 --> 00:44:15,155
Go to the General Staff

557
00:44:15,355 --> 00:44:17,307
read the situation

558
00:44:17,619 --> 00:44:19,888
on the Stalingrad front and ...

559
00:44:20,088 --> 00:44:21,349
Calculate your work like this

560
00:44:21,549 --> 00:44:24,193
to fly to Stalingrad tomorrow.

561
00:44:24,393 --> 00:44:27,455
I obey! Let me go? Go ahead.

562
00:44:44,502 --> 00:44:45,602
Take your wand.

563
00:44:48,784 --> 00:44:50,783
And about the son of Khrushchev -

564
00:44:55,932 --> 00:44:58,768
let him demoted to the rank and file

565
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:03,955
and will be sent to the front.

566
00:45:05,573 --> 00:45:09,073
I obey.

567
00:46:07,377 --> 00:46:08,377
Well, I'm on the bus.

568
00:46:09,385 --> 00:46:10,385
If he still walks.

569
00:46:10,823 --> 00:46:12,627
Are you going to call your father?

570
00:46:14,151 --> 00:46:15,151
Not.

571
00:46:16,416 --> 00:46:17,416
You are not foolish.

572
00:46:18,323 --> 00:46:19,573
He will be glad to see you.

573
00:46:21,541 --> 00:46:22,459
Until I return the senior lieutenant -

574
00:46:22,659 --> 00:46:25,049
I will not go. And don't tell me about it.

575
00:46:27,080 --> 00:46:28,080
Okay.

576
00:46:29,018 --> 00:46:30,767
Let's go for a minute, say goodbye.

577
00:46:31,244 --> 00:46:33,534
Come on, don’t think. Let's go.

578
00:46:47,025 --> 00:46:49,587
Allow me to sit down for 5 minutes.

579
00:46:56,330 --> 00:46:59,768
Just don’t order anything - I have everything.

580
00:47:03,940 --> 00:47:04,940
For our witnesses!

581
00:47:09,487 --> 00:47:12,096
Witnesses of what? Our marriage.

582
00:47:12,948 --> 00:47:17,017
We just decided to get married.

583
00:47:18,244 --> 00:47:20,094
Here, get acquainted, Vera, she is ...

584
00:47:20,541 --> 00:47:22,643
My fiancee. Very nice.

585
00:47:26,838 --> 00:47:27,838
And my name is Vasya.

586
00:47:28,416 --> 00:47:29,866
Now let's drink - right to the registry office.

587
00:47:34,737 --> 00:47:37,080
I, you see, I don’t have relatives,

588
00:47:37,815 --> 00:47:39,034
So I decided to help Vera.

589
00:47:40,135 --> 00:47:41,135
She is an orphan

590
00:47:42,096 --> 00:47:43,713
I will leave her a monetary certificate.

591
00:47:44,369 --> 00:47:45,498
Still, the commander’s wife is easier to live

592
00:47:45,698 --> 00:47:46,698
in the rear.

593
00:47:49,909 --> 00:47:50,909
Is he like that

594
00:47:52,143 --> 00:47:53,443
why did you come up with all this?

595
00:47:55,682 --> 00:47:56,682
Well done, Vasya.

596
00:47:58,901 --> 00:48:00,060
And it didn’t occur to us

597
00:48:00,260 --> 00:48:01,960
make some girls happy.

598
00:48:04,776 --> 00:48:05,776
Well,

599
00:48:07,112 --> 00:48:08,112
for your future.

600
00:48:39,799 --> 00:48:40,799
Wait you!

601
00:48:52,073 --> 00:48:53,073
Vera.

602
00:48:56,330 --> 00:48:57,330
Verka!

603
00:48:58,565 --> 00:48:59,665
She didn’t tell us anything.

604
00:49:00,698 --> 00:49:01,623
We accidentally found out the dining room

605
00:49:01,823 --> 00:49:03,173
by the way, what are you in the registry office

606
00:49:03,612 --> 00:49:05,260
gone. - Well, do not be angry, Nadya.

607
00:49:06,518 --> 00:49:07,518
You need to go to the front.

608
00:49:08,065 --> 00:49:09,465
We just met.

609
00:49:09,955 --> 00:49:11,305
Will we meet, girls?

610
00:49:11,791 --> 00:49:13,191
You are Nadya, I already heard.

611
00:49:13,619 --> 00:49:17,951
Is your name Lyuba? Yes. How do you know?

612
00:49:18,151 --> 00:49:19,151
If there is Faith,

613
00:49:20,846 --> 00:49:23,065
There is hope next to me

614
00:49:23,955 --> 00:49:25,155
it should be Love.

615
00:49:26,198 --> 00:49:27,198
Mandatory.

616
00:49:29,284 --> 00:49:31,354
The law of probability theory.

617
00:49:33,596 --> 00:49:35,792
Vera, we brought you a summons.

618
00:49:36,596 --> 00:49:37,857
All our school, all the girls

619
00:49:38,057 --> 00:49:39,689
drafted into the army.

620
00:49:40,994 --> 00:49:42,144
I knew it would be so.

621
00:49:45,705 --> 00:49:46,705
Thank you, Vasya.

622
00:49:47,971 --> 00:49:49,482
I believe that in these three hours you fell in love

623
00:49:49,682 --> 00:49:50,682
me.

624
00:49:52,057 --> 00:49:52,888
Now no need

625
00:49:53,088 --> 00:49:54,510
monetary certificate.

626
00:50:01,815 --> 00:50:02,815
I'm so happy!

627
00:50:07,104 --> 00:50:08,404
Well, I will also say goodbye.

628
00:50:10,526 --> 00:50:11,676
Stay alive, Ruben.

629
00:50:23,080 --> 00:50:28,412
August 12, 1942 flew to Moscow

630
00:50:28,612 --> 00:50:30,666
Prime Minister. Great Britain.

631
00:50:30,916 --> 00:50:31,916
Winston Churchill.

632
00:50:40,862 --> 00:50:42,432
Soviet command

633
00:50:43,424 --> 00:50:46,455
made a plan for its summer operations

634
00:50:47,260 --> 00:50:49,416
counting on the opening of a second front

635
00:50:49,713 --> 00:50:53,174
in Europe in 1942.

636
00:50:54,604 --> 00:50:56,576
But the failure of the UK government

637
00:50:56,776 --> 00:50:59,573
from creating a second front in Europe,

638
00:51:00,784 --> 00:51:04,073
greatly complicated the situation of the Red Army.

639
00:51:06,455 --> 00:51:07,455
We believe,

640
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:12,424
what are the most favorable conditions now

641
00:51:12,682 --> 00:51:16,560
to open a second front. Nearly

642
00:51:16,760 --> 00:51:19,369
all the forces of the German troops,

643
00:51:20,752 --> 00:51:24,443
and while the best forces are distracted

644
00:51:24,643 --> 00:51:25,682
to the eastern front.

645
00:51:27,143 --> 00:51:29,474
And in Europe, there was a negligible

646
00:51:29,674 --> 00:51:33,346
part of the German troops. Moreover, the worst.

647
00:51:34,549 --> 00:51:36,119
We are handing you a memorandum

648
00:51:36,627 --> 00:51:37,627
about this question.

649
00:51:45,659 --> 00:51:46,659
I will answer

650
00:51:48,244 --> 00:51:51,018
to this memorandum in writing.

651
00:51:59,221 --> 00:52:02,823
And about the German forces in. Europe

652
00:52:05,409 --> 00:52:08,412
then they are enough to repel

653
00:52:08,612 --> 00:52:10,644
Allied troops landing.

654
00:52:12,744 --> 00:52:15,494
This is a big risk. Head

655
00:52:16,252 --> 00:52:18,549
who thinks about losses all the time,

656
00:52:19,416 --> 00:52:21,221
can't win the war.

657
00:52:23,963 --> 00:52:25,060
The british army is not

658
00:52:25,260 --> 00:52:27,885
must be so afraid of the Germans.

659
00:52:29,385 --> 00:52:30,646
I am indignant at this

660
00:52:30,846 --> 00:52:31,677
accusation and I can forgive

661
00:52:31,877 --> 00:52:33,552
him just because I admire

662
00:52:33,752 --> 00:52:35,760
the heroic struggle of the Red Army.

663
00:52:36,541 --> 00:52:37,591
As for the problem

664
00:52:37,791 --> 00:52:38,991
second front in Europe,

665
00:52:39,315 --> 00:52:40,294
then preparation for implementation

666
00:52:40,494 --> 00:52:41,919
major landing operations in

667
00:52:42,119 --> 00:52:43,216
northern France in

668
00:52:43,416 --> 00:52:45,244
1943 will continue.

669
00:52:45,744 --> 00:52:48,323
It’s not what words he said

670
00:52:48,549 --> 00:52:49,549
Prime Minister,

671
00:52:49,776 --> 00:52:51,138
but in what he demonstrated

672
00:52:51,338 --> 00:52:54,862
us our determination and. Fighting spirit.

673
00:53:02,868 --> 00:53:03,868
What's his name?

674
00:53:04,612 --> 00:53:06,932
Personal bodyguard of the British Prime Minister

675
00:53:07,182 --> 00:53:08,182
Commander Thompson.

676
00:53:08,916 --> 00:53:10,888
Head of Comrade Stalin’s security.

677
00:53:12,518 --> 00:53:13,518
Translate.

678
00:53:14,479 --> 00:53:16,979
Comrade Stalin’s life is very dear,

679
00:53:18,151 --> 00:53:19,751
and we cherish it like the apple of an eye.

680
00:53:21,635 --> 00:53:22,885
How to translate the apple of an eye?

681
00:53:24,307 --> 00:53:25,599
In a word, say that

682
00:53:26,612 --> 00:53:27,612
comrade Stalin -

683
00:53:28,096 --> 00:53:29,646
our brilliant leader is a teacher.

684
00:53:30,784 --> 00:53:33,442
Under the conditions of the machinations of German fascism,

685
00:53:34,518 --> 00:53:37,362
all kinds of actions of enemies of the people are possible.

686
00:53:38,909 --> 00:53:39,909
Until the assassination attempt.

687
00:53:41,182 --> 00:53:42,332
Therefore on our part

688
00:53:43,409 --> 00:53:45,153
need constant vigilance.

689
00:53:48,799 --> 00:53:49,771
To me as a personal bodyguard

690
00:53:49,971 --> 00:53:51,763
Mr. Churchill

691
00:53:52,534 --> 00:53:53,784
also have to exercise

692
00:53:54,065 --> 00:53:56,291
special vigilance. Hard work.

693
00:53:57,612 --> 00:53:59,614
Especially, try brandy all day.

694
00:54:01,833 --> 00:54:03,479
History shows that many

695
00:54:03,737 --> 00:54:05,137
statesmen were

696
00:54:05,424 --> 00:54:07,177
poisoned by alcohol.

697
00:54:08,338 --> 00:54:09,427
But despite this, mister.

698
00:54:09,627 --> 00:54:11,630
Churchill intensively consumes it.

699
00:54:13,448 --> 00:54:14,903
I frankly admit

700
00:54:15,385 --> 00:54:16,919
I can’t stand the cognac.

701
00:54:17,369 --> 00:54:19,069
We also have to try everything.

702
00:54:20,127 --> 00:54:21,527
Comrade Stalin drinks first

703
00:54:22,627 --> 00:54:24,077
then different Georgian wines,

704
00:54:24,458 --> 00:54:26,230
here and the head is stunned.

705
00:54:27,471 --> 00:54:28,821
How to translate "stunned"?

706
00:54:29,323 --> 00:54:30,323
How can you?

707
00:54:30,916 --> 00:54:33,690
Well, a person becomes an idiot. Go ahead.

708
00:54:40,823 --> 00:54:43,463
All these wines are on the table of a comrade. Stalin.

709
00:54:43,737 --> 00:54:45,302
Is all this to be tried?

710
00:54:45,502 --> 00:54:47,602
Everyone, we don’t know what they will drink.

711
00:54:49,073 --> 00:54:51,159
Let's work, Tommy.

712
00:55:19,159 --> 00:55:20,294
What does Mr. Stalin think

713
00:55:20,494 --> 00:55:22,638
about the possibility of meeting between him and

714
00:55:22,838 --> 00:55:24,388
president of the united states?

715
00:55:25,479 --> 00:55:28,091
It could take place somehow in the winter.

716
00:55:29,181 --> 00:55:31,521
As for the venue,

717
00:55:32,221 --> 00:55:34,588
then it could be carried out, for example,

718
00:55:35,330 --> 00:55:37,651
in Iceland. In Reykjavik.

719
00:55:39,643 --> 00:55:40,950
I suggest a drink

720
00:55:41,869 --> 00:55:45,401
for the president’s health. Roosevelt

721
00:56:17,549 --> 00:56:18,549
What happened here?

722
00:56:20,080 --> 00:56:22,138
You know, Your Excellency,

723
00:56:22,338 --> 00:56:23,169
Tommy can have a drink

724
00:56:23,369 --> 00:56:25,130
a lot of wine and never gets drunk.

725
00:56:25,619 --> 00:56:27,419
For this I appreciate him.

726
00:56:28,643 --> 00:56:29,771
But, this time he

727
00:56:29,971 --> 00:56:31,371
overestimated their capabilities,

728
00:56:31,737 --> 00:56:33,768
competing with Russian colleagues.

729
00:56:49,560 --> 00:56:53,263
August 19 German shock groups

730
00:56:53,463 --> 00:56:56,787
forced Don and created a bridgehead on his

731
00:56:56,987 --> 00:57:00,310
east coast for offensive on.

732
00:57:00,510 --> 00:57:04,010
Stalingrad.

733
00:57:14,604 --> 00:57:17,927
Commander of the 62nd Army, General Lopatin,

734
00:57:18,127 --> 00:57:21,451
trying to drive the German troops off the bridgehead,

735
00:57:21,651 --> 00:57:24,974
threw a counterattack of the 35th Guards Rifle

736
00:57:25,174 --> 00:57:28,674
the division.

737
00:58:06,947 --> 00:58:10,189
Forward! Follow me!

738
00:58:14,016 --> 00:58:15,716
Damn cowards!

739
00:58:15,916 --> 00:58:17,783
On the stomachs, calluses will be grated.

740
00:58:18,784 --> 00:58:22,174
Anu, stop chilling! Get up!

741
00:58:22,541 --> 00:58:26,041
Forward!

742
00:58:50,729 --> 00:58:55,146
What is wrong with you, Comrade Captain?

743
00:58:55,346 --> 00:59:02,369
Heals before the wedding. Tanks!

744
00:59:21,314 --> 00:59:23,334
The tanks passed by.

745
00:59:23,534 --> 00:59:26,857
I repeat 100 German tanks passed us.

746
00:59:27,057 --> 00:59:30,557
Go to Stalingrad.

747
01:00:15,205 --> 01:00:16,501
Until the war ends

748
01:00:18,159 --> 01:00:19,853
no hope of getting married.

749
01:00:22,744 --> 01:00:23,744
Lucky for you, Verka.

750
01:00:25,088 --> 01:00:26,393
You still have a husband.

751
01:00:27,354 --> 01:00:30,307
Husband. Overeating pears.

752
01:00:31,393 --> 01:00:33,326
Fool! She didn't even him

753
01:00:33,526 --> 01:00:34,963
tried what kind of husband he is.

754
01:00:35,666 --> 01:00:38,236
The receipt is one in the passport.

755
01:00:41,143 --> 01:00:42,143
And for me he

756
01:00:42,502 --> 01:00:44,377
still the best man.

757
01:00:45,205 --> 01:00:46,205
My husband, Vasya.

758
01:00:49,026 --> 01:00:51,400
Girls, get ready for the bath.

759
01:00:53,221 --> 01:00:55,034
Girls, name is!

760
01:01:08,838 --> 01:01:11,393
Wait! Halt.

761
01:01:12,346 --> 01:01:13,346
Halt!

762
01:01:43,392 --> 01:01:44,542
Maybe we won’t wake up?

763
01:01:49,971 --> 01:01:51,580
We are going to look for bosses.

764
01:02:07,073 --> 01:02:10,181
Captain Ibarruri. Combat of the 35th guard.

765
01:02:11,541 --> 01:02:12,541
Commander 1077

766
01:02:12,744 --> 01:02:14,302
anti-aircraft artillery regiment

767
01:02:14,502 --> 01:02:15,502
Lieutenant Colonel German.

768
01:02:15,721 --> 01:02:17,321
You know, Comrade Lieutenant Colonel,

769
01:02:17,893 --> 01:02:19,037
that the Germans managed to cross over.

770
01:02:19,237 --> 01:02:20,474
Don? And after a few hours they

771
01:02:20,674 --> 01:02:21,705
may be here.

772
01:02:23,682 --> 01:02:24,682
Not.

773
01:02:26,041 --> 01:02:28,424
No artillery headquarters.

774
01:02:29,838 --> 01:02:30,838
Have you seen refugees?

775
01:02:33,088 --> 01:02:35,188
Well, I think we don’t have to panic.

776
01:02:35,760 --> 01:02:36,910
I have a girl in the regiment.

777
01:02:38,010 --> 01:02:39,710
Where is your emergency deployment point?

778
01:02:41,893 --> 01:02:43,560
We must move to the northern outskirts.

779
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:44,760
Stalingrad.

780
01:02:45,674 --> 01:02:47,111
Cover the tractor factory.

781
01:02:50,354 --> 01:02:51,804
We must immediately raise the regiment.

782
01:02:52,471 --> 01:02:54,080
I will rush them through the sentries.

783
01:03:00,612 --> 01:03:01,612
Signora!

784
01:03:02,057 --> 01:03:03,529
Signora, after all, there is the Great Patriotic War

785
01:03:03,729 --> 01:03:05,088
war.

786
01:03:05,471 --> 01:03:08,971
Well, well, get away from military equipment!

787
01:03:10,330 --> 01:03:11,330
Come away!

788
01:03:13,315 --> 01:03:14,846
What does emancipation only do!

789
01:03:50,596 --> 01:03:54,159
We are not men - we are commanders. Anxiety!

790
01:03:54,799 --> 01:03:55,747
Get dressed immediately!

791
01:03:55,947 --> 01:03:59,869
We cannot, we are wet. It’s dripping from us!

792
01:04:02,775 --> 01:04:04,767
And you turn away.

793
01:04:07,924 --> 01:04:08,924
Get up!

794
01:04:12,635 --> 01:04:13,693
Get in line immediately.

795
01:04:13,893 --> 01:04:15,065
Outsiders are here!

796
01:04:31,448 --> 01:04:32,748
Sorry Comrade Captain.

797
01:04:33,096 --> 01:04:34,096
We are not combed.

798
01:04:36,026 --> 01:04:37,026
Hello brides!

799
01:04:38,737 --> 01:04:41,404
Girls! Everyone needs to be fast

800
01:04:41,604 --> 01:04:44,543
collect. Try to be brave.

801
01:04:45,768 --> 01:04:48,416
Ahead of the battle. Have questions?

802
01:04:49,409 --> 01:04:50,459
Comrade Lieutenant Colonel

803
01:04:50,940 --> 01:04:52,640
let go into battle in civil

804
01:04:52,916 --> 01:04:56,134
slippers. We were given shoes of 41 sizes.

805
01:04:56,651 --> 01:04:57,987
They say there are no others.

806
01:04:58,448 --> 01:05:00,939
And my friends and I wear 33.

807
01:05:01,815 --> 01:05:03,635
Almost 10 sizes smaller.

808
01:05:04,338 --> 01:05:05,338
Look here.

809
01:05:15,612 --> 01:05:16,612
Okay.

810
01:05:17,604 --> 01:05:18,853
Go to the battle in shoes.

811
01:05:20,354 --> 01:05:23,854
Hooray!

812
01:05:36,784 --> 01:05:37,784
Nikita Sergeevich?

813
01:05:38,463 --> 01:05:40,877
Do you know the situation at the front?

814
01:05:41,213 --> 01:05:42,372
German tanks in

815
01:05:42,572 --> 01:05:44,408
one and a half kilometers from the city.

816
01:05:45,885 --> 01:05:46,885
It can't be!

817
01:05:48,229 --> 01:05:51,948
I just saw German tanks from the window!

818
01:05:53,041 --> 01:05:54,279
Do whatever it takes to

819
01:05:54,479 --> 01:05:56,971
to detain the Germans before the approach of our troops.

820
01:06:09,518 --> 01:06:11,318
I wish you good health, Comrade Lieutenant Colonel.

821
01:06:12,096 --> 01:06:13,096
Hello Ruben.

822
01:06:15,244 --> 01:06:16,244
Managed to turn around?

823
01:06:20,487 --> 01:06:21,537
We also turned around.

824
01:06:27,541 --> 01:06:30,065
You know what, let's have a smoke.

825
01:06:58,440 --> 01:07:00,651
The girls and I will not leave our positions.

826
01:07:05,518 --> 01:07:06,618
And we will not back down either!

827
01:07:07,393 --> 01:07:08,893
Russian infantry is to death.

828
01:07:13,104 --> 01:07:14,654
Allow me to say goodbye in Russian?

829
01:07:33,815 --> 01:07:34,815
Comrade Captain

830
01:07:35,065 --> 01:07:37,515
The commander of the 12th detachment is Senior Lieutenant Savkin.

831
01:07:38,236 --> 01:07:40,186
I want to inform you that I

832
01:07:40,815 --> 01:07:43,768
I occupy those heights. Why there, in the rear?

833
01:07:44,432 --> 01:07:45,732
Immediately in the first line!

834
01:07:45,948 --> 01:07:48,682
I have no right. According to order number 227,

835
01:07:49,135 --> 01:07:51,185
I must not allow your retreat.

836
01:07:51,432 --> 01:07:53,082
In all the departing I will shoot

837
01:07:53,916 --> 01:07:55,963
from machine guns. So, for now -

838
01:07:56,432 --> 01:07:59,323
get out of here. Out!

839
01:08:39,338 --> 01:08:42,838
Direct guns on tanks!

840
01:09:03,283 --> 01:09:08,713
Girls! Girls, you have to!

841
01:09:10,119 --> 01:09:11,705
Well be afraid - do not be afraid, it is necessary!

842
01:09:12,424 --> 01:09:17,693
Well! Well, charge! Nadia, charge! To the gun!

843
01:09:17,893 --> 01:09:21,216
Get ready for battle, girls!

844
01:09:21,416 --> 01:09:31,416
Come on, dear! Gun! Fire!

845
01:09:34,182 --> 01:09:37,505
How many tanks have gathered today?

846
01:09:37,705 --> 01:09:41,877
28. And 32 is at the training center.

847
01:09:42,830 --> 01:09:45,354
True, considering those that are not on the go.

848
01:09:45,830 --> 01:09:47,830
Those not on the go

849
01:09:48,510 --> 01:09:51,834
can be used. Tow and use as fire

850
01:09:52,034 --> 01:09:52,974
points. - Good.

851
01:09:53,174 --> 01:09:56,630
Drivers, I think you have?

852
01:09:56,830 --> 01:09:57,830
Type.

853
01:10:03,487 --> 01:10:05,401
And you, fathers, are too late to fight.

854
01:10:06,557 --> 01:10:09,252
Go to jobs. How late is it?

855
01:10:10,932 --> 01:10:11,963
Why is it too late?

856
01:10:12,166 --> 01:10:14,776
It's never too late to fight, especially when

857
01:10:15,049 --> 01:10:17,127
Fritz grabbed by the throat.

858
01:10:18,112 --> 01:10:20,326
Rifles would be for us, then if you had seen.

859
01:10:20,526 --> 01:10:21,724
Late or not late.

860
01:10:21,924 --> 01:10:24,159
I defended Tsaritsyn from the White Guards.

861
01:10:24,502 --> 01:10:25,505
So please write me down

862
01:10:25,705 --> 01:10:27,119
to the fighter battalion.

863
01:10:27,619 --> 01:10:30,284
And I fought in the Baltic. And with the Germans.

864
01:10:30,729 --> 01:10:32,401
How old are you?

865
01:10:33,549 --> 01:10:37,044
Well, what years to take? We are still head start for you

866
01:10:37,244 --> 01:10:39,369
give such.

867
01:10:54,159 --> 01:10:55,159
Girls,

868
01:10:56,276 --> 01:10:57,276
you are future mothers.

869
01:10:58,651 --> 01:11:00,588
I want you to save your life.

870
01:11:02,198 --> 01:11:04,494
Go to the Volga. There are boats.

871
01:11:04,862 --> 01:11:07,564
Comrade Lieutenant Colonel!

872
01:11:09,619 --> 01:11:13,752
Do not! I order! Go!

873
01:11:16,705 --> 01:11:17,705
Let's go.

874
01:11:44,830 --> 01:11:48,330
Closer. Let it get closer.

875
01:12:13,018 --> 01:12:16,517
Comrade Captain! Comrade Captain, hold on!

876
01:12:16,767 --> 01:12:20,161
We will cut off the infantry from the tank. “But you are shooting?”

877
01:12:20,361 --> 01:12:23,861
Only in your own way! Yours will not run.

878
01:12:58,823 --> 01:13:00,248
Three days and three nights

879
01:13:00,448 --> 01:13:03,771
armed militia workers, anti-aircraft gunners

880
01:13:03,971 --> 01:13:04,912
and sailors

881
01:13:05,112 --> 01:13:08,435
fought with the enemy breaking through to Stalingrad and

882
01:13:08,635 --> 01:13:12,135
stopped him on the northern outskirts of the city.

883
01:13:36,760 --> 01:13:39,166
Thanks, Captain Ibarruri.

884
01:13:41,025 --> 01:13:42,205
You defended Stalingrad.

885
01:13:46,377 --> 01:13:48,979
Write to my mother

886
01:13:51,548 --> 01:13:53,133
so as not to cry.

887
01:13:55,862 --> 01:13:57,948
Good. But you still get better.

888
01:13:59,760 --> 01:14:02,346
September 4, 1942

889
01:14:03,705 --> 01:14:06,591
the glorious son of the Spanish people died

890
01:14:06,791 --> 01:14:09,826
Hero of the Soviet Union Captain Ruben.

891
01:14:10,026 --> 01:14:12,299
Ibarruri Comrade Stalin,

892
01:14:13,166 --> 01:14:14,830
the situation in Stalingrad is difficult.

893
01:14:15,893 --> 01:14:17,584
All measures are taken. To defend.

894
01:14:17,784 --> 01:14:18,784
Stalingrad.

895
01:14:19,955 --> 01:14:23,135
But the city leadership has an opinion

896
01:14:23,549 --> 01:14:24,896
about the need for evacuation

897
01:14:25,096 --> 01:14:27,080
population beyond the Volga.

898
01:14:28,174 --> 01:14:29,971
If evacuation begins or

899
01:14:30,674 --> 01:14:33,888
mining of the plant, then these actions will be

900
01:14:34,088 --> 01:14:36,994
understood as a decision to pass. Stalingrad.

901
01:14:37,502 --> 01:14:41,123
Therefore. State Defense Committee

902
01:14:41,323 --> 01:14:42,510
prohibits evacuation.

903
01:14:45,987 --> 01:14:46,987
I obey!

904
01:14:52,526 --> 01:14:55,849
The enemy threw all aviation at Stalingrad

905
01:14:56,049 --> 01:14:59,373
its 4th air fleet. That evening

906
01:14:59,573 --> 01:15:03,073
600 planes bombed the city.

907
01:15:42,862 --> 01:15:45,763
Filmed from the Caucasus,

908
01:15:45,963 --> 01:15:50,701
4th German Panzer Army September 10

909
01:15:50,901 --> 01:15:54,224
pushed our units to the outskirts of Stalingrad

910
01:15:54,424 --> 01:16:00,146
and went to the Volga, cutting off 62 army.

911
01:16:17,323 --> 01:16:20,393
In the south of Stalingrad there was a serious danger of encirclement.

912
01:16:20,876 --> 01:16:23,993
You can not wait until the enemy closes the ring.

913
01:16:24,979 --> 01:16:27,854
It is necessary to withdraw troops. Not!

914
01:16:28,346 --> 01:16:30,244
I do not allow army withdrawal!

915
01:16:36,455 --> 01:16:38,510
What! Please allow

916
01:16:38,979 --> 01:16:41,034
in order to preserve the forces of the army

917
01:16:41,510 --> 01:16:44,568
Allocate 3 divisions of the left flank to the middle defensive contour.

918
01:16:44,768 --> 01:16:47,580
To leave the Don border ourselves?

919
01:16:49,104 --> 01:16:53,252
Do you remember order 227? So, I demand!

920
01:16:53,557 --> 01:16:55,123
Eliminate the enemy breakthrough to the Volga

921
01:16:55,323 --> 01:16:57,807
on our own, everything! Got it?

922
01:17:11,127 --> 01:17:12,240
Do you know what I saw today?

923
01:17:12,440 --> 01:17:14,549
At Unter den Linden

924
01:17:15,268 --> 01:17:18,099
fenced new ruins and made the inscription on the fence:

925
01:17:18,299 --> 01:17:20,026
"Construction work is underway."

926
01:17:20,815 --> 01:17:22,146
Someone signed in capital letters.

927
01:17:22,346 --> 01:17:25,260
"Work Producer. - Winston Churchill."

928
01:17:29,299 --> 01:17:30,849
How long will you stay in Berlin?

929
01:17:31,979 --> 01:17:34,784
Tomorrow I’ll leave for Hamburg, and then back to the sea.

930
01:17:35,619 --> 01:17:37,752
Father all guards the old woman England.

931
01:17:38,362 --> 01:17:40,599
We hold the old woman tight by the throat.

932
01:17:40,799 --> 01:17:42,799
So far, they have nothing to think about the second front.

933
01:17:43,362 --> 01:17:46,115
They don’t think. Now everything is decided under.

934
01:17:46,315 --> 01:17:47,315
Stalingrad.

935
01:17:51,698 --> 01:17:52,838
Ah, you said

936
01:17:53,166 --> 01:17:54,560
that Russians can predict our

937
01:17:54,760 --> 01:17:55,932
blow to Stalingrad?

938
01:17:58,018 --> 01:18:00,346
I too believed in their common sense.

939
01:18:08,221 --> 01:18:10,224
Well, friends, quickly to the table.

940
01:18:43,627 --> 01:18:44,977
Mr. Crime Advisor,

941
01:18:45,518 --> 01:18:47,060
the car you saw in raien

942
01:18:47,260 --> 01:18:48,552
where was the broadcast from

943
01:18:48,752 --> 01:18:50,200
standing at the house of Schulzaboyzen.

944
01:18:52,049 --> 01:18:53,549
The house gathered a lot of guests.

945
01:18:54,604 --> 01:18:55,537
And if you need to install behind them

946
01:18:55,737 --> 01:18:58,004
surveillance, reinforcement required.

947
01:18:59,565 --> 01:19:03,419
What is the full name? Harro Schulzeboisen.

948
01:19:04,455 --> 01:19:06,583
A group of agents is about to leave.

949
01:19:07,112 --> 01:19:08,262
Keep watching.

950
01:19:10,244 --> 01:19:12,435
Urgently file a file on Harro.

951
01:19:12,635 --> 01:19:13,635
Schulzeboisen.

952
01:19:21,166 --> 01:19:22,412
Says crime adviser.

953
01:19:22,612 --> 01:19:25,302
Penziger, radiogram captured in Brussels, decrypted?

954
01:19:25,502 --> 01:19:29,084
Who could know the text of the radiogram?

955
01:19:29,284 --> 01:19:31,380
I am writing down. Three persons from the ministry

956
01:19:31,580 --> 01:19:35,932
navy. To whom? To Gerring,

957
01:19:36,651 --> 01:19:38,596
his deputy general Yeshenyk and

958
01:19:39,776 --> 01:19:42,302
Abwehr Harro Service Officer.

959
01:19:42,502 --> 01:19:45,432
Schulzeboisen. How is the radiogram signed?

960
01:19:46,330 --> 01:19:47,330
Chorus.

961
01:20:00,487 --> 01:20:01,713
The card read

962
01:20:02,080 --> 01:20:03,709
that Harro Schultzeboizen -

963
01:20:03,909 --> 01:20:06,932
descendant of the famous admiral von Tirbits.

964
01:20:07,682 --> 01:20:08,560
What does he protect himself

965
01:20:08,760 --> 01:20:09,979
Reich Marshal Gerring.

966
01:20:11,049 --> 01:20:12,466
But at the same time it was written

967
01:20:12,666 --> 01:20:15,748
that 9 years ago. Schulzeboisen was

968
01:20:15,948 --> 01:20:17,990
arrested on charges of

969
01:20:18,190 --> 01:20:19,590
anti-Nazi activities.

970
01:20:20,237 --> 01:20:22,740
They released him by order of the same.

971
01:20:22,940 --> 01:20:23,940
Gerringa.

972
01:20:24,909 --> 01:20:26,940
There was something to think about.

973
01:20:30,776 --> 01:20:31,776
Let's take a risk.

974
01:20:33,463 --> 01:20:36,154
Harro Schultzeboizena was arrested 30

975
01:20:36,354 --> 01:20:38,854
August c. Ministry of Air

976
01:20:39,190 --> 01:20:41,755
fleet. Warn almost nobody

977
01:20:41,955 --> 01:20:42,955
failed.

978
01:20:44,041 --> 01:20:45,127
In a few days

979
01:20:45,838 --> 01:20:46,927
other members were also arrested.

980
01:20:47,127 --> 01:20:48,221
Red chapel.

981
01:20:48,869 --> 01:20:50,201
Hitler was in Ukraine at the rate

982
01:20:50,401 --> 01:20:51,401
near Vinnitsa.

983
01:20:51,791 --> 01:20:52,802
Summer offensive on Stalingrad

984
01:20:53,002 --> 01:20:54,221
was in full swing.

985
01:20:54,502 --> 01:20:56,427
And yet, when he was informed of the arrests,

986
01:20:56,627 --> 01:20:58,784
he dropped everything and flew to Berlin.

987
01:21:01,260 --> 01:21:03,490
Keep the arrests secret. Not a single word

988
01:21:03,690 --> 01:21:05,041
in print, or on the radio.

989
01:21:05,955 --> 01:21:07,209
For the disclosure of any materials

990
01:21:07,409 --> 01:21:09,005
there can be only one punishment -

991
01:21:09,205 --> 01:21:11,615
the death penalty. My Fuehrer,

992
01:21:11,815 --> 01:21:13,365
the investigation will make them speak.

993
01:21:14,768 --> 01:21:15,732
Arrest subject

994
01:21:15,932 --> 01:21:17,560
torture. Even if it

995
01:21:17,760 --> 01:21:18,810
will lead to their death.

996
01:21:24,518 --> 01:21:25,768
Lieutenant General Chuykov.

997
01:21:27,768 --> 01:21:30,104
Hi. Sit down, Vasily Ivanovich.

998
01:21:34,244 --> 01:21:35,244
Sit down.

999
01:21:37,315 --> 01:21:39,755
The Germans decided to take it at any cost.

1000
01:21:39,955 --> 01:21:40,955
Stalingrad.

1001
01:21:42,291 --> 01:21:43,846
But we will not give it to the fascists.

1002
01:21:47,580 --> 01:21:50,721
You can’t retreat anymore and nowhere to go.

1003
01:21:54,587 --> 01:21:56,228
Retreat is the end.

1004
01:21:58,041 --> 01:22:00,896
Commander of the 62nd Army Lopatin

1005
01:22:01,526 --> 01:22:02,982
believes that his armies

1006
01:22:03,182 --> 01:22:04,182
the city will not be held.

1007
01:22:05,307 --> 01:22:07,518
Instead of standing to the death

1008
01:22:07,721 --> 01:22:10,034
die, but not let the enemy go to the Volga,

1009
01:22:10,838 --> 01:22:13,127
he thinks about how to take the parts.

1010
01:22:14,182 --> 01:22:15,582
Therefore, removed from command.

1011
01:22:18,901 --> 01:22:20,151
And you, Vasily Ivanovich,

1012
01:22:20,510 --> 01:22:21,412
we then called to

1013
01:22:21,612 --> 01:22:22,912
offer a new position

1014
01:22:23,260 --> 01:22:25,557
Commander of the 62nd Army.

1015
01:22:25,932 --> 01:22:27,732
The situation in the army is very tense.

1016
01:22:28,205 --> 01:22:29,355
How are you, comrade Chuykov?

1017
01:22:30,432 --> 01:22:31,432
Do you understand the task?

1018
01:22:35,002 --> 01:22:36,002
What i think?

1019
01:22:37,041 --> 01:22:38,490
I think there will be order.

1020
01:22:39,705 --> 01:22:41,591
Let them meet - meet

1021
01:22:41,791 --> 01:22:43,154
you to rip their god into the soul.

1022
01:22:43,877 --> 01:22:44,771
While I'm alive, not one

1023
01:22:44,971 --> 01:22:47,432
the fascist curvy will not work for me.

1024
01:22:54,909 --> 01:22:59,729
I understood the task correctly. I think the question

1025
01:23:00,002 --> 01:23:01,151
the appointment is decided.

1026
01:23:06,119 --> 01:23:07,185
Here is my hand, Vasily

1027
01:23:07,385 --> 01:23:08,412
Ivanovich. And sooner

1028
01:23:08,612 --> 01:23:10,971
our hands will dry out, than we will surrender Stalingrad.

1029
01:23:11,807 --> 01:23:13,044
Even stepping over our corpses,

1030
01:23:13,244 --> 01:23:17,005
the enemy must not take mountains. Clear?

1031
01:23:17,205 --> 01:23:20,705
Clear.

1032
01:23:43,927 --> 01:23:45,646
I don’t hear, huh?

1033
01:23:45,846 --> 01:23:51,268
Well, you can say louder, huh? What? Well?

1034
01:23:51,487 --> 01:23:53,971
I am Seagulls. I am Krylov.

1035
01:23:54,909 --> 01:23:58,424
What? How many boxes do you have? One?

1036
01:23:59,268 --> 01:24:00,443
In the 6th brigade, one tank remained.

1037
01:24:00,643 --> 01:24:02,315
And how about the neighbors?

1038
01:24:04,026 --> 01:24:04,959
Clear.

1039
01:24:05,159 --> 01:24:06,755
The other two brigades are completely without tanks.

1040
01:24:06,955 --> 01:24:08,846
The third is listening!

1041
01:24:10,291 --> 01:24:12,838
What, no nails left? All bent?

1042
01:24:14,002 --> 01:24:16,099
Commander 87 passes, no people.

1043
01:24:16,299 --> 01:24:19,018
One headquarters remained. Where are my deputies?

1044
01:24:19,627 --> 01:24:21,373
Your tank deputies

1045
01:24:21,573 --> 01:24:23,388
artillery, engineering troops fell ill.

1046
01:24:23,588 --> 01:24:24,955
And ask to send them

1047
01:24:25,588 --> 01:24:26,838
to the east bank of the Volga.

1048
01:24:29,377 --> 01:24:30,643
Did everyone get sick right away?

1049
01:24:32,963 --> 01:24:33,963
Yes, all at once.

1050
01:24:35,580 --> 01:24:38,237
Once sick, let them roll.

1051
01:24:40,112 --> 01:24:43,904
Ah, Kuzma Akimovich! So we met!

1052
01:24:44,104 --> 01:24:46,846
Well, how's the spirit? Tall?

1053
01:24:47,955 --> 01:24:49,448
Of course, we’re not losing heart,

1054
01:24:51,104 --> 01:24:53,823
but one spirit is not enough. We need infantry and tanks.

1055
01:24:54,362 --> 01:24:55,823
Someday everything will be.

1056
01:24:57,337 --> 01:24:58,728
Vasily Ivanovich,

1057
01:24:59,674 --> 01:25:00,732
in us General Lopatin

1058
01:25:00,932 --> 01:25:02,332
removed from the command of the army.

1059
01:25:03,549 --> 01:25:04,549
Not wanting to leave.

1060
01:25:04,807 --> 01:25:06,357
Stalingrad without direct order,

1061
01:25:06,588 --> 01:25:07,688
Lopatin stayed here.

1062
01:25:08,237 --> 01:25:09,987
And the front command forgot about him.

1063
01:25:11,213 --> 01:25:14,041
Where is he? Behind the partition.

1064
01:25:25,571 --> 01:25:27,001
Wow.

1065
01:25:36,573 --> 01:25:38,744
I will give you the army.

1066
01:25:39,345 --> 01:25:41,302
Or what is left of her.

1067
01:25:44,041 --> 01:25:45,654
There is an aimless struggle.

1068
01:25:46,580 --> 01:25:48,271
You can’t defend Stalingrad.

1069
01:25:49,088 --> 01:25:52,698
You will die here. Or they’ll shoot you.

1070
01:25:53,580 --> 01:25:54,588
For the surrender of the city.

1071
01:25:56,159 --> 01:25:57,997
Leaving for the east coast?

1072
01:25:59,143 --> 01:26:01,541
You understand? Understand.

1073
01:26:03,807 --> 01:26:05,362
Do you give me the order?

1074
01:26:06,299 --> 01:26:07,299
Yes.

1075
01:26:08,237 --> 01:26:09,237
I give it.

1076
01:26:13,534 --> 01:26:14,534
Now I will go.

1077
01:26:32,041 --> 01:26:35,744
The enemy decided to destroy us at all costs.

1078
01:26:36,823 --> 01:26:38,068
For our part, we should not

1079
01:26:38,268 --> 01:26:40,232
just defend.

1080
01:26:41,104 --> 01:26:42,471
We must counterattack.

1081
01:26:42,776 --> 01:26:44,575
And at every opportunity,

1082
01:26:45,994 --> 01:26:47,705
Remember what Suvorov said?

1083
01:26:49,182 --> 01:26:51,330
To surprise is to win!

1084
01:26:52,252 --> 01:26:54,096
We will counterattack.

1085
01:26:54,916 --> 01:26:56,766
Take the initiative and confuse the Germans.

1086
01:26:57,127 --> 01:27:00,091
Let's try to surprise!
