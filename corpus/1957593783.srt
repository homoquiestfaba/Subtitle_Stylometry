1
00:00:01,891 --> 00:00:05,058
(gentle techno music)

2
00:00:12,984 --> 00:00:16,484
(gentle orchestral music)

3
00:02:01,673 --> 00:02:04,586
(dog barking)

4
00:02:04,586 --> 00:02:06,850
- [Natalie] Sandy, bring in the presents.

5
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:07,713
- Okay, Mom.

6
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,524
That looks great, Mom.

7
00:02:14,524 --> 00:02:16,550
Did you get the candles?

8
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:18,420
- 22 and one to grow on.

9
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:22,243
I can't wait for Matt to get here.

10
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,560
Why aren't you dressed yet?

11
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:28,720
- I'm gonna take a walk.

12
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,567
- Didn't you just do the treadmill?

13
00:02:30,567 --> 00:02:32,380
- The doctor told me to exercise.

14
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:34,028
- [Natalie] He also told
you not to overdo it.

15
00:02:34,028 --> 00:02:35,190
- Yeah, I know.

16
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:37,700
You're putting them too far apart.

17
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:40,527
She won't be able to blow them out.

18
00:02:44,129 --> 00:02:44,962
- He means well.

19
00:02:44,962 --> 00:02:45,990
- I'm moving out.

20
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:46,907
- Now, stop that.

21
00:02:46,907 --> 00:02:48,751
- Ah, come on, Mom,
this just isn't working.

22
00:02:48,751 --> 00:02:50,980
- You're dad wants you here and so do I.

23
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:54,556
- I'll have enough money as
soon as the divorce is final.

24
00:02:54,556 --> 00:02:58,056
(gentle orchestral music)

25
00:03:08,408 --> 00:03:11,075
(country music)

26
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,580
- Ms. Pierce is here.

27
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:24,623
- Oh, I forgot all about her.

28
00:03:27,405 --> 00:03:28,320
Can you take her please?

29
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:29,153
- I already offered.

30
00:03:29,153 --> 00:03:30,050
She said you're the only one here

31
00:03:30,050 --> 00:03:31,798
who can cover her bald spot.

32
00:03:31,798 --> 00:03:32,760
- Oh, I'm gonna be late again.

33
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:33,930
My dad's gonna kill me.

34
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:35,150
- Come on, Sarah, you
can have her in and out

35
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:36,040
in no time.

36
00:03:44,086 --> 00:03:47,003
- [Sandy] Ooh, look, here they are.

37
00:03:49,607 --> 00:03:50,440
- Hi.

38
00:03:52,993 --> 00:03:54,558
Angel boy.

39
00:03:54,558 --> 00:03:56,254
- [Martha] Hi, Mom.

40
00:03:56,254 --> 00:03:57,461
- Hi, Roger.
- Hi.

41
00:03:57,461 --> 00:03:59,110
- [Natalie] Give Grandma a kiss.

42
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:00,430
- I hope we're not late.

43
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:01,890
- You are not late.

44
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:03,683
You're right on the dot.

45
00:04:03,683 --> 00:04:04,983
Thank you.

46
00:04:04,983 --> 00:04:06,240
- Where's the birthday girl?

47
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:08,630
- You know, Sarah, she
lives in her own time zone.

48
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:10,630
- Uh-huh, don't start.

49
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:12,213
She'll be here any minute.

50
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,807
- I'm gonna go watch the
end of the game, okay?

51
00:04:15,807 --> 00:04:17,240
- Okay.

52
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:19,423
- Let's take this off, it's hot.

53
00:04:19,423 --> 00:04:20,425
- I will do it.

54
00:04:20,425 --> 00:04:22,360
- You'll do it? Okay.

55
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,460
How was your last day?

56
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:24,952
- Actually, it was really nice.

57
00:04:24,952 --> 00:04:27,213
They offered to double
my salary if I'd stay

58
00:04:27,213 --> 00:04:28,340
and my new boss called.

59
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:30,620
I'm getting a company car.

60
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:31,914
- Terrific.
- Yeah.

61
00:04:31,914 --> 00:04:33,328
- Easy, easy.

62
00:04:33,328 --> 00:04:35,568
- There he is. Hey.

63
00:04:35,568 --> 00:04:37,420
How you doing?

64
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:39,023
- Fine, fine.

65
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:41,670
- Matty.

66
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:42,800
- Guess what?

67
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,340
I'm getting a company car

68
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:46,415
and a corner office, what
do you think of that?

69
00:04:46,415 --> 00:04:47,494
- What do I think? Well,
I think it's great.

70
00:04:47,494 --> 00:04:48,630
You know what I think.

71
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:49,840
- No, I don't.

72
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,610
You never said a word about my new job.

73
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:53,500
- [John] Oh, honey, come on.

74
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:56,370
- Grandma has a surprise
for you in the kitchen

75
00:04:56,370 --> 00:04:58,420
and Grandma needs you to carve the roast.

76
00:05:01,444 --> 00:05:04,361
(traffic whirring)

77
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:12,560
- Amy, don't run off like that.

78
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,393
Give me your hand, come on.

79
00:05:13,393 --> 00:05:14,732
We gotta get home.

80
00:05:14,732 --> 00:05:16,700
We're having a very
special dinner tonight.

81
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:17,569
- How come?

82
00:05:17,569 --> 00:05:18,910
- To celebrate Aunt Lydia's new job.

83
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:21,025
- Are we having hot dogs?

84
00:05:21,025 --> 00:05:22,581
- No.

85
00:05:22,581 --> 00:05:23,840
That's your favorite meal.

86
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:26,133
Aunt Lydia likes my stir, remember.

87
00:05:27,254 --> 00:05:28,320
And she also likes ice cream.

88
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,060
- With chocolate sauce?

89
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:31,320
- Yeah, tons of it.

90
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:32,637
Oh, you're okay.

91
00:05:35,298 --> 00:05:38,562
(engine revving)

92
00:05:38,562 --> 00:05:41,145
(Amy laughing)

93
00:05:43,053 --> 00:05:43,886
What's the matter?

94
00:05:43,886 --> 00:05:45,886
- Somebody's calling me.

95
00:05:46,788 --> 00:05:47,991
- That's just the wind.

96
00:05:47,991 --> 00:05:48,888
- [Danny] Amy.

97
00:05:48,888 --> 00:05:50,349
- It makes funny noises sometimes.

98
00:05:50,349 --> 00:05:52,682
- No, I heard a man, listen.

99
00:05:57,512 --> 00:05:58,512
- God, jeez.

100
00:06:01,503 --> 00:06:03,747
You are a crazy fool.

101
00:06:03,747 --> 00:06:06,663
- Did I scare you? I didn't mean to.

102
00:06:06,663 --> 00:06:08,135
Hey, Danielle, do you think you could talk

103
00:06:08,135 --> 00:06:10,230
to your sister for me?

104
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:13,300
See if I can, she won't
have nothing to do with me.

105
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:15,467
- You're such a loser, Danny.

106
00:06:15,467 --> 00:06:16,770
Lydia finally figured it out.

107
00:06:16,770 --> 00:06:19,070
She wants you to stay away.

108
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:19,903
So do I.

109
00:06:21,856 --> 00:06:22,993
- Bye, Amy.

110
00:06:27,622 --> 00:06:30,372
(women laughing)

111
00:06:31,527 --> 00:06:33,415
- [Sarah] Oh, my God, you guys.

112
00:06:33,415 --> 00:06:34,780
Thank you so much.

113
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:35,613
You put a lot of thought into this.

114
00:06:35,613 --> 00:06:36,950
- Happy birthday.
- Don't lose it.

115
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:39,617
- Hey, everybody look over here.

116
00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:41,763
Perfect.

117
00:06:41,763 --> 00:06:42,860
- [John] Thank you for coming.

118
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:45,680
- Martha, do you have a sitter for Sunday?

119
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:46,664
- Yep, I'm all set.

120
00:06:46,664 --> 00:06:48,300
Is Ed watching the motel?

121
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:50,033
- No, he had to go to a funeral.

122
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:51,970
- I'm gonna do it.

123
00:06:55,010 --> 00:06:55,860
Oh, give me a break, Martha.

124
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:57,760
I think I can handle it for one night.

125
00:07:02,672 --> 00:07:03,674
- Mom, come on.

126
00:07:03,674 --> 00:07:05,000
Man of the Year is a big honor.

127
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:05,970
It's an important night for Dad.

128
00:07:05,970 --> 00:07:07,645
You can't count on Sarah.

129
00:07:07,645 --> 00:07:10,060
- You are something.

130
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:11,774
Sarah wants to go to Dad's party,

131
00:07:11,774 --> 00:07:13,480
but she knows we're in a bind,

132
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,760
so she offered to watch the motel.

133
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:16,530
She's trying to be more responsible.

134
00:07:16,530 --> 00:07:18,820
- She was late for her own birthday party.

135
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:19,750
- She had to work.

136
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:21,191
- Why are you always defending her?

137
00:07:21,191 --> 00:07:22,973
- Why are you always attacking her?

138
00:07:23,864 --> 00:07:24,697
(Martha scoffs)

139
00:07:24,697 --> 00:07:27,549
- Come on, Martha, let's go.
- Goodnight.

140
00:07:27,549 --> 00:07:28,549
- Goodnight.

141
00:07:30,941 --> 00:07:33,884
Call me when you get home.

142
00:07:33,884 --> 00:07:36,765
(engine revving)

143
00:07:36,765 --> 00:07:40,265
(gentle orchestral music)

144
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:47,457
- It was very pretty.

145
00:07:47,457 --> 00:07:48,882
Why don't you go get
that little candlestick

146
00:07:48,882 --> 00:07:50,153
off my bureau.

147
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:54,941
- Hi, Amy.
- Hey.

148
00:07:54,941 --> 00:07:55,774
- Hi.

149
00:07:57,220 --> 00:07:58,053
I quit.

150
00:07:59,739 --> 00:08:01,083
- [Danielle] What do you mean you quit?

151
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:04,370
- I mean my boss is kind of a jerk.

152
00:08:04,370 --> 00:08:05,900
He like made me work on my lunch hour

153
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:07,500
and everything, so, I quit.

154
00:08:09,881 --> 00:08:13,293
- You couldn't just last through one day?

155
00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:17,614
- Danielle, please, don't get
all peeved out, all right?

156
00:08:17,614 --> 00:08:19,080
- It's not that big a deal.

157
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:20,800
I just quit.

158
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,863
- It was a good job, Lydia.

159
00:08:24,210 --> 00:08:26,988
- Yeah, well, not as good as my new one.

160
00:08:26,988 --> 00:08:28,523
- What are you talking about?

161
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:30,940
- Well, today on my way home,

162
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:32,440
I was walking by that
new market, you know,

163
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:34,625
and they're like looking for cashiers,

164
00:08:34,625 --> 00:08:36,470
so I met up with the manager

165
00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:39,293
and he thinks I got a pretty good chance.

166
00:08:40,890 --> 00:08:42,730
- Honey, you can't just go jumping around

167
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:43,563
from job to job.

168
00:08:43,563 --> 00:08:44,790
- I know, this job pays
like 12 bucks an hour.

169
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:46,573
Is that all right?

170
00:08:46,573 --> 00:08:48,203
Amy, how are you?

171
00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:53,430
- We've got ice cream
with chocolate sauce.

172
00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:54,263
- We do?

173
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:57,633
- Honey, why don't you go wash your hands.

174
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:06,073
I saw Danny today.

175
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:09,183
He followed me and Amy.

176
00:09:10,082 --> 00:09:11,230
He nearly scared us to death.

177
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:15,930
- Yeah, did he say
something or what'd he say?

178
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:17,243
- He wants you back.

179
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:21,000
- Ain't happening this time.

180
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:21,833
It's not.

181
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:26,943
I mean, I'm not scared
of him anymore, you know.

182
00:09:26,943 --> 00:09:29,443
(man banging)

183
00:09:31,435 --> 00:09:33,484
- [Man] Anyone in there?

184
00:09:33,484 --> 00:09:34,871
Fire, wake up.

185
00:09:34,871 --> 00:09:35,722
- Danielle!

186
00:09:35,722 --> 00:09:36,555
Danielle!

187
00:09:36,555 --> 00:09:38,222
Amy, there's a fire.

188
00:09:39,727 --> 00:09:42,477
(sirens blaring)

189
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:55,257
- [Amy] The windows,
let's get to the window.

190
00:09:55,257 --> 00:09:58,007
(dramatic music)

191
00:10:07,019 --> 00:10:09,519
(baby crying)

192
00:10:10,368 --> 00:10:13,035
(siren blaring)

193
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,330
- Said it was the wiring.

194
00:10:17,330 --> 00:10:19,633
It's been shorting out for months.

195
00:10:20,565 --> 00:10:23,315
(dramatic music)

196
00:10:37,216 --> 00:10:41,099
- [Child] Here, kitty,
come on, kitty, kitty.

197
00:10:41,099 --> 00:10:44,099
(suspenseful music)

198
00:10:57,141 --> 00:11:00,641
(gentle orchestral music)

199
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,583
(bell ringing)

200
00:11:28,949 --> 00:11:29,899
- Hi.
- Good evening.

201
00:11:29,899 --> 00:11:32,030
- I'm really sorry to get you out of bed.

202
00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:33,632
We just had a fire in our building

203
00:11:33,632 --> 00:11:35,445
and the fireman said you might put us up

204
00:11:35,445 --> 00:11:37,750
for the night?

205
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:40,593
He says that you
sometimes help people out.

206
00:11:42,464 --> 00:11:43,620
I'll be honest with you.

207
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:45,370
I don't have any money right now,

208
00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:46,910
but I'll pay you back.

209
00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:48,550
I promise.

210
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:50,112
- I've got money, Mommy.

211
00:11:50,112 --> 00:11:54,612
I can pay.

212
00:11:54,612 --> 00:11:57,450
- Well, let's not worry about that now.

213
00:11:57,450 --> 00:11:58,750
First let's get everyone to bed.

214
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:00,731
- Thank you so much.

215
00:12:00,731 --> 00:12:01,803
I promise I'll pay you back.

216
00:12:01,803 --> 00:12:03,380
- It's all right.

217
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:04,343
Right this way.

218
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,060
Just follow me back here.

219
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:09,765
I've got an extra room for you.

220
00:12:09,765 --> 00:12:12,265
(dog barking)

221
00:12:24,596 --> 00:12:26,002
- Hey, good morning.

222
00:12:26,002 --> 00:12:27,050
- Good morning.

223
00:12:27,050 --> 00:12:28,270
- We go there late last night.

224
00:12:28,270 --> 00:12:29,420
And I'm wondering if you could do our room

225
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:30,520
a little later.

226
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:32,600
My little girl and my
sister are still asleep.

227
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:33,439
- Oh, sure, that's not a problem.

228
00:12:33,439 --> 00:12:34,591
- Thank you very much.

229
00:12:34,591 --> 00:12:36,008
- It's all right.

230
00:12:40,084 --> 00:12:43,084
(suspenseful music)

231
00:12:45,821 --> 00:12:48,691
- Now's the chance, buddy.

232
00:12:48,691 --> 00:12:51,813
- Nah, not now, she's
got the kid with her.

233
00:12:53,605 --> 00:12:56,025
I want her later, alone.

234
00:12:56,025 --> 00:12:58,691
- I ain't got nothing but time.

235
00:12:58,691 --> 00:13:01,441
(engine revving)

236
00:13:20,217 --> 00:13:22,967
(Sarah knocking)

237
00:13:24,210 --> 00:13:25,050
- Hi.
- Hi.

238
00:13:25,050 --> 00:13:26,243
- My mom keeps these around for my nephew.

239
00:13:26,243 --> 00:13:28,600
I thought maybe the little
girl would like them.

240
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,263
- Oh, cool, thanks, come on in.

241
00:13:36,225 --> 00:13:37,490
(door closes)

242
00:13:37,490 --> 00:13:38,330
- [Lydia] So you cut hair.

243
00:13:38,330 --> 00:13:39,823
That's like a tough job.

244
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:44,190
Do you live here like all the time.

245
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:45,023
- I'm trying to save up money.

246
00:13:45,023 --> 00:13:48,277
I got into some trouble with credit cards.

247
00:13:48,277 --> 00:13:49,577
- Oh, maxed them out, huh?

248
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:52,113
- Good thing for my dad.

249
00:13:53,030 --> 00:13:55,480
- [Lydia] He seems real
nice, real considerate.

250
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:56,380
- Yeah, he is.

251
00:13:56,380 --> 00:13:58,192
He's always doing things for other people,

252
00:13:58,192 --> 00:14:02,140
always helping out, even now.

253
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:02,973
- [Lydia] What do you mean?

254
00:14:02,973 --> 00:14:04,730
- I mean he had a heart attack.

255
00:14:04,730 --> 00:14:05,563
- Wow, sorry.

256
00:14:05,563 --> 00:14:07,840
I mean, you'd never know
it if you looked at him.

257
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:09,890
- Yeah, it runs in his family.

258
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:13,063
His dad died really young.

259
00:14:15,033 --> 00:14:17,963
I think he's afraid the same
thing's gonna happen to him.

260
00:14:27,754 --> 00:14:28,587
- Dad.

261
00:14:30,690 --> 00:14:32,110
I just, um, I wanted to thank you

262
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:33,360
for bailing me out again.

263
00:14:35,490 --> 00:14:36,740
- You missed a spot here.

264
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:39,680
- You know, I learned my lesson this time.

265
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,633
I did, I'm not gonna screw up again.

266
00:14:44,042 --> 00:14:44,875
I promise.

267
00:14:46,517 --> 00:14:48,184
- Good. That's good.

268
00:14:49,450 --> 00:14:50,442
- Dad, I'm gonna be done here in a second.

269
00:14:50,442 --> 00:14:53,061
Do you want to play cards or something?

270
00:14:53,061 --> 00:14:55,000
- Maybe later.

271
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,250
I gotta take my walk now.

272
00:14:57,536 --> 00:14:58,543
- I love you, Dad.

273
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:02,067
- I know that, honey.

274
00:15:02,067 --> 00:15:04,650
(gentle music)

275
00:15:09,018 --> 00:15:10,600
- Wait a minute, now hold on a second.

276
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:12,374
You stick your nose in our business,

277
00:15:12,374 --> 00:15:13,790
let me tell you something.

278
00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:15,870
The only reason you
want Lydia to stay away

279
00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:17,980
is so you have a free babysitter.

280
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:18,813
- [Lydia] Danny.

281
00:15:18,813 --> 00:15:19,646
- And you know it.

282
00:15:19,646 --> 00:15:20,479
- Listen.
- You have a free baby-

283
00:15:20,479 --> 00:15:21,417
- What? What do you want me to do?

284
00:15:21,417 --> 00:15:22,250
- I'm am not gonna go back to you.

285
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:25,070
- Listen, just tell her to
stay out of it, all right.

286
00:15:25,070 --> 00:15:26,263
You're a grown woman.

287
00:15:26,263 --> 00:15:27,335
- Watch the kid, man, come on.

288
00:15:27,335 --> 00:15:29,639
- All right, we're gonna talk
about this a little more.

289
00:15:29,639 --> 00:15:31,056
Stay out of this!

290
00:15:31,909 --> 00:15:34,042
We're gonna talk about it ourselves alone.

291
00:15:34,042 --> 00:15:36,229
- Lydia, don't go!

292
00:15:36,229 --> 00:15:37,730
- You're really making me angry.

293
00:15:37,730 --> 00:15:39,020
- Oh, well, listen.

294
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:41,009
I just remember-
- Chill out.

295
00:15:41,009 --> 00:15:42,817
- What's going on out here?

296
00:15:42,817 --> 00:15:43,910
- None of your damn business.

297
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:44,872
That's what's going on out here.

298
00:15:44,872 --> 00:15:46,520
- Why don't you leave
before I call the police.

299
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:47,421
- So you're gonna call the police?

300
00:15:47,421 --> 00:15:48,794
- Yes, I'm gonna call the police.

301
00:15:48,794 --> 00:15:50,373
- Wait minute, be a man and
I'll do anything you want.

302
00:15:50,373 --> 00:15:51,738
- You don't have to do this.

303
00:15:51,738 --> 00:15:54,414
- It's all right, Mr. Porter.

304
00:15:54,414 --> 00:15:58,457
I'm, I'll be fine, just don't
call the police, please.

305
00:15:58,457 --> 00:15:59,290
Thank you.

306
00:16:00,436 --> 00:16:02,137
(door slams)

307
00:16:02,137 --> 00:16:04,023
- You all right?

308
00:16:04,023 --> 00:16:04,856
- She's all right.

309
00:16:04,856 --> 00:16:08,370
It's just a lover's quarrel, that's all.

310
00:16:08,370 --> 00:16:09,820
- You don't have to do this.

311
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:12,570
(engine revving)

312
00:16:24,602 --> 00:16:25,840
- It's okay.

313
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:27,549
She's gonna be back.

314
00:16:27,549 --> 00:16:29,031
They're just gonna go talk, okay.

315
00:16:29,031 --> 00:16:29,864
It's okay.

316
00:16:30,877 --> 00:16:31,710
It's okay.

317
00:16:34,055 --> 00:16:36,555
(door closes)

318
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:45,520
- Did you get any sleep at all last night?

319
00:16:46,951 --> 00:16:49,123
- Mm, couple hours.

320
00:16:51,090 --> 00:16:52,440
- Bored with the treadmill?

321
00:16:55,210 --> 00:16:56,510
- I'm doing this for Matt.

322
00:16:57,863 --> 00:16:59,591
I did it for all the girls, remember.

323
00:16:59,591 --> 00:17:00,674
- I remember.

324
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:02,573
I don't know, but he might have

325
00:17:02,573 --> 00:17:04,410
to wait a couple of years to use this.

326
00:17:06,941 --> 00:17:07,774
- Ah.

327
00:17:07,774 --> 00:17:09,338
- Oh, honey, you've healthier than

328
00:17:09,338 --> 00:17:11,600
you've ever been in your life.

329
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:14,009
You're gonna dance at Matt's wedding

330
00:17:14,009 --> 00:17:16,092
and it better be with me.

331
00:17:17,410 --> 00:17:19,300
Your jacket came out great.

332
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:20,700
We have to be ready by five.

333
00:17:27,190 --> 00:17:28,873
Did you remember to take your medicine?

334
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:30,673
- Yeah.

335
00:17:32,030 --> 00:17:33,690
- Mom, does this look as bad

336
00:17:33,690 --> 00:17:35,600
as I think it does?

337
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,000
- Open the jacket.

338
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,020
- I must have gained 10 pounds.

339
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:40,688
- That's better.

340
00:17:40,688 --> 00:17:42,013
- It looks fine, really.

341
00:17:43,013 --> 00:17:44,313
- You're not even looking.

342
00:17:47,310 --> 00:17:51,715
- Why do you do that?

343
00:17:51,715 --> 00:17:52,548
- Do what?

344
00:17:53,470 --> 00:17:56,030
- You know how important
your opinion is to her.

345
00:17:56,030 --> 00:17:58,360
- She's so touchy about everything I say.

346
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:01,252
- She has absolutely no
self confidence, John.

347
00:18:01,252 --> 00:18:03,370
Just because the girls
are grown doesn't mean

348
00:18:03,370 --> 00:18:04,870
they don't need your approval.

349
00:18:07,270 --> 00:18:08,103
You look nice.

350
00:18:15,570 --> 00:18:17,623
- Hi, Mrs. Porter, hi, I just wanted,

351
00:18:17,623 --> 00:18:19,224
oh, I'm sorry, love, hi,

352
00:18:19,224 --> 00:18:20,820
I just want to thank you so much

353
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:22,210
for everything, you and your husband

354
00:18:22,210 --> 00:18:24,290
and I want to give you some money.

355
00:18:24,290 --> 00:18:25,460
This is only part of what I owe,

356
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:27,263
but I'm good for the rest.

357
00:18:27,263 --> 00:18:28,340
I just got a second job.

358
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:30,830
- Well, you pay when you can.

359
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:32,088
Just take care of that little girl.

360
00:18:32,088 --> 00:18:33,080
- Yeah.

361
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:35,114
I also wanna give you my
new address in Rockwater

362
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:37,017
and my phone number at work.

363
00:18:37,017 --> 00:18:38,620
I would have given you
my new home phone number,

364
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:40,037
but it's not connected yet.

365
00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:43,780
I just don't want you to
think I'm skipping out on you.

366
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:46,169
Hey, I wanna thank you much for the toys.

367
00:18:46,169 --> 00:18:47,427
I left them on the bed.

368
00:18:47,427 --> 00:18:48,430
- You're welcome.

369
00:18:48,430 --> 00:18:49,960
- You people have been so nice.

370
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:51,640
Thank you so much.

371
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:52,967
- Bye.
- Thank you.

372
00:18:52,967 --> 00:18:54,563
- You be good, bye.

373
00:18:56,409 --> 00:18:57,583
- There goes trouble.

374
00:18:59,210 --> 00:19:00,180
Where's your dad's boutonniere?

375
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:01,013
- Oh, God.

376
00:19:02,552 --> 00:19:04,610
- Don't tell me you forgot it.

377
00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:05,840
I ordered it I just...

378
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:08,220
- [Natalie] Forgot to pick it up.

379
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:09,090
- I'll be right back.

380
00:19:09,090 --> 00:19:10,489
- Never mind.

381
00:19:10,489 --> 00:19:11,577
It doesn't-

382
00:19:11,577 --> 00:19:12,590
- Good, you're here.

383
00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:14,523
- Actually, I was just leaving.

384
00:19:15,690 --> 00:19:17,600
- Well, aren't you supposed
to watch the office?

385
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,703
- Yeah, I just have to go get something,

386
00:19:19,703 --> 00:19:21,940
some cigarettes and I'll be right back.

387
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:22,940
- I thought you quit.

388
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:24,270
- I did.

389
00:19:24,270 --> 00:19:25,470
I'll be back in a flash.

390
00:19:27,618 --> 00:19:28,620
- She's just going-

391
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:29,757
- I don't need to know.

392
00:19:29,757 --> 00:19:32,340
(gentle music)

393
00:19:42,056 --> 00:19:44,889
(tires squealing)

394
00:19:48,430 --> 00:19:51,563
(door closes)

395
00:19:51,563 --> 00:19:53,416
- I'm saying flat out all he said

396
00:19:53,416 --> 00:19:56,590
is that at 7 o'clock, he's gone.

397
00:19:56,590 --> 00:19:57,700
- Why you laughing at me, man?

398
00:19:57,700 --> 00:19:58,830
My cart busted.

399
00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:00,310
- I'm not talking about your truck.

400
00:20:00,310 --> 00:20:01,326
It's not about your truck, man.

401
00:20:01,326 --> 00:20:03,624
All I'm saying is that we have

402
00:20:03,624 --> 00:20:05,320
to steal a car or something.

403
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:06,323
- Danny.

404
00:20:06,323 --> 00:20:07,363
You're on parole.

405
00:20:07,363 --> 00:20:08,267
- Oh, great.

406
00:20:08,267 --> 00:20:10,493
All I'm saying is that
we don't have a car.

407
00:20:10,493 --> 00:20:11,510
- What about Frank?

408
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:13,090
You call Frank?

409
00:20:13,090 --> 00:20:14,736
- Yeah, I called Frank? What do you think?

410
00:20:14,736 --> 00:20:16,327
- What about Jesus? Did you talk to Jesus?

411
00:20:16,327 --> 00:20:18,563
- Jesus is-
- Jesus is dead, man.

412
00:20:21,370 --> 00:20:23,877
- I'm just saying in a
couple of, sorry, buddy.

413
00:20:23,877 --> 00:20:24,773
- Sorry.

414
00:20:26,408 --> 00:20:28,686
- Here, let me get that for you.

415
00:20:28,686 --> 00:20:30,990
- That was real cool.

416
00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:34,137
- What I'm saying is in a couple of hours,

417
00:20:34,137 --> 00:20:35,763
in a couple of hours,

418
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:40,240
we're gonna be out and you
don't wanna go without, man.

419
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,508
We don't-
- Danny, chill.

420
00:20:41,508 --> 00:20:42,543
- Wanna go without.

421
00:20:43,425 --> 00:20:44,258
- Chill.

422
00:20:44,258 --> 00:20:45,841
- I'm cool.
- Chill.

423
00:20:46,766 --> 00:20:49,349
(gentle music)

424
00:20:52,564 --> 00:20:54,903
- [Lydia] I know her, I know her.

425
00:20:54,903 --> 00:20:56,670
Hey, Sarah, Sarah.

426
00:20:56,670 --> 00:20:57,980
- Hi, how you doing?

427
00:20:57,980 --> 00:20:58,813
- I'm all right.

428
00:20:58,813 --> 00:21:01,640
Listen, me and Danny,
we really need a ride.

429
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:02,484
Could you-

430
00:21:02,484 --> 00:21:04,630
- You know, I'm in such a hurry, I just,

431
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:05,463
I gotta get home.

432
00:21:05,463 --> 00:21:06,900
- You know what, it's
only like a couple miles-

433
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:08,113
- Sarah, right.

434
00:21:08,113 --> 00:21:11,750
Hi, see the thing is we just need to go,

435
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:12,780
it's just a little short way.

436
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:13,840
- You know what, you guys,

437
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:14,829
normally I would, it's just my parents

438
00:21:14,829 --> 00:21:15,832
are waiting for me.

439
00:21:15,832 --> 00:21:18,582
- [Lydia] Sarah, please, come on.

440
00:21:19,481 --> 00:21:21,432
Could you just do this for us, please?

441
00:21:21,432 --> 00:21:22,521
- Just this time.

442
00:21:22,521 --> 00:21:23,604
- Okay, okay.

443
00:21:25,184 --> 00:21:28,767
(gentle suspenseful music)

444
00:21:49,829 --> 00:21:52,329
(door closes)

445
00:22:11,392 --> 00:22:13,120
- This is ridiculous.

446
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:14,660
- Look, why don't you guys go on ahead.

447
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:16,360
I'll say here till Sarah shows up.

448
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:19,200
- Roger's right.

449
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,403
- Maybe she had car trouble.

450
00:22:20,403 --> 00:22:22,153
- Well, we can't keep them waiting.

451
00:22:25,693 --> 00:22:27,443
- I'll see you later.

452
00:22:28,806 --> 00:22:31,806
(suspenseful music)

453
00:22:38,685 --> 00:22:39,750
(Lydia laughing)

454
00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:41,000
- I don't think I need any more of these.

455
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:41,903
Here, thanks.

456
00:22:44,067 --> 00:22:45,672
You want some trouble, huh,

457
00:22:45,672 --> 00:22:46,680
I'll give you some trouble.

458
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:47,513
Now, wait a minute.

459
00:22:47,513 --> 00:22:48,680
Don't, you're gonna spill the joint.

460
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:49,933
You're gonna spill it.

461
00:22:52,456 --> 00:22:53,760
Just stop it, okay,

462
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:55,810
look, I'm spilling it all over the place.

463
00:22:57,808 --> 00:22:58,958
Not now, okay, not now.

464
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:06,140
- This league award is long overdue.

465
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:06,973
- Oh, I think we just-

466
00:23:06,973 --> 00:23:08,752
- No, no, really, we have all been touched

467
00:23:08,752 --> 00:23:11,686
by your kindness at one time or another.

468
00:23:11,686 --> 00:23:12,519
- Look at him.

469
00:23:12,519 --> 00:23:15,303
He's having the time of
his life, Prince Charming.

470
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:17,133
- He barely knows that woman.

471
00:23:17,133 --> 00:23:18,770
You think they were best friends.

472
00:23:18,770 --> 00:23:21,040
- Yeah, well strangers have
always been easier for him.

473
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:21,873
You know that.

474
00:23:21,873 --> 00:23:22,706
- Listen, I'm gonna sneak out

475
00:23:22,706 --> 00:23:24,630
and call the motel, see
if Roger's had any calls.

476
00:23:24,630 --> 00:23:27,110
- Mom, it's Sarah for
God sakes, she's fine.

477
00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:29,133
She probably just ran into some friends.

478
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:34,613
- Stop it.

479
00:23:36,130 --> 00:23:37,190
Rob, take this.

480
00:23:38,415 --> 00:23:41,165
(Lydia laughing)

481
00:23:44,031 --> 00:23:46,220
What are you, what are you doing?

482
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:47,053
- Look, you guys are just gonna have

483
00:23:47,053 --> 00:23:48,447
to get out here, okay, um.

484
00:23:48,447 --> 00:23:49,280
- What?

485
00:23:51,865 --> 00:23:52,698
Hold this.

486
00:23:54,509 --> 00:23:55,842
- I'm sorry, my folks are waiting

487
00:23:55,842 --> 00:23:57,840
for me back home and I...

488
00:23:59,204 --> 00:24:03,679
- You see, the thing is all
you gotta do is just drive us

489
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:04,940
to the country

490
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:08,280
and then you just drive us right back.

491
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:12,353
That's not that complicated, is it, huh?

492
00:24:17,828 --> 00:24:18,661
Okay.

493
00:24:20,993 --> 00:24:21,826
Okay.

494
00:24:27,596 --> 00:24:28,429
Nice.

495
00:24:31,669 --> 00:24:34,669
(suspenseful music)

496
00:24:38,699 --> 00:24:41,699
(guests applauding)

497
00:24:48,353 --> 00:24:49,353
- Thank you.

498
00:24:50,974 --> 00:24:51,807
Thank you.

499
00:24:54,304 --> 00:24:56,887
(gentle music)

500
00:25:08,757 --> 00:25:11,515
- We can't ride without tunes.

501
00:25:11,515 --> 00:25:12,682
- It's broken.

502
00:25:17,418 --> 00:25:20,501
- Maybe I'll fix it for you sometime.

503
00:25:23,804 --> 00:25:25,387
- That's all right.

504
00:25:28,223 --> 00:25:29,390
- Pretty hair.

505
00:25:34,718 --> 00:25:37,968
Ever wanna bleach it, just let me know.

506
00:25:41,962 --> 00:25:43,527
- [Sarah] Why are you doing this?

507
00:25:43,527 --> 00:25:46,944
- We're not doing anything, what is that?

508
00:25:48,391 --> 00:25:51,005
(horn blowing)
(tires squealing)

509
00:25:51,005 --> 00:25:51,922
- Oh, whoa.

510
00:26:00,892 --> 00:26:01,725
God.

511
00:26:04,914 --> 00:26:06,100
- Rob!

512
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:07,196
Hey, get the keys Rob.

513
00:26:07,196 --> 00:26:08,754
Rob, she took the keys.

514
00:26:08,754 --> 00:26:10,254
She took the keys.

515
00:26:13,223 --> 00:26:14,498
Where's she going?

516
00:26:14,498 --> 00:26:15,581
Stupid bitch.

517
00:26:18,154 --> 00:26:19,637
Hey!

518
00:26:19,637 --> 00:26:21,429
Come on.

519
00:26:21,429 --> 00:26:24,179
(dramatic music)

520
00:26:34,495 --> 00:26:36,745
Hey, just give us the keys.

521
00:26:39,921 --> 00:26:40,754
Come here.

522
00:26:45,066 --> 00:26:45,899
Come here!

523
00:27:01,439 --> 00:27:02,522
There she is.

524
00:27:04,127 --> 00:27:06,877
(Danny laughing)

525
00:27:07,985 --> 00:27:09,735
- Oh, we got you now!

526
00:27:10,677 --> 00:27:11,594
We got you!

527
00:27:12,949 --> 00:27:15,366
- [Danny] Give me those keys.

528
00:27:17,557 --> 00:27:18,649
- Hey.
- Hey, come on.

529
00:27:18,649 --> 00:27:19,482
- Hey.

530
00:27:19,482 --> 00:27:21,624
- Come on, quit playing possum.

531
00:27:21,624 --> 00:27:23,957
- [Rob] Quit messing around.

532
00:27:26,374 --> 00:27:28,848
- Hey, wait, wait a minute.

533
00:27:28,848 --> 00:27:30,348
I don't think she's breathing.

534
00:27:34,406 --> 00:27:35,267
- I think she's dead.

535
00:27:35,267 --> 00:27:36,730
- No, shut up, man, don't say that.

536
00:27:36,730 --> 00:27:38,110
She's all right.

537
00:27:38,110 --> 00:27:39,880
Hey! Hey! Come on.

538
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:41,366
- I think she's dead.
- Hey, wake up.

539
00:27:41,366 --> 00:27:43,286
- All right, here, come on.

540
00:27:43,286 --> 00:27:44,119
- [Rob] Wait.

541
00:27:44,119 --> 00:27:46,036
- I didn't do anything.

542
00:27:47,573 --> 00:27:48,859
Come on man, come on.

543
00:27:48,859 --> 00:27:50,747
All right, let's go.

544
00:27:50,747 --> 00:27:53,330
(gentle music)

545
00:28:00,027 --> 00:28:01,212
Do it.

546
00:28:01,212 --> 00:28:03,795
(gentle music)

547
00:28:11,963 --> 00:28:14,796
(thunder roaring)

548
00:28:17,126 --> 00:28:19,499
(dog barking)

549
00:28:19,499 --> 00:28:20,332
Let's go.

550
00:28:50,294 --> 00:28:53,024
- What the hell is going on?

551
00:28:53,024 --> 00:28:54,222
What the hell is going on, where is she?

552
00:28:54,222 --> 00:28:55,271
- Take these.

553
00:28:55,271 --> 00:28:56,279
- Where's Sarah?

554
00:28:56,279 --> 00:28:57,112
- She's gonna be all right.

555
00:28:57,112 --> 00:28:58,032
- Danny.
- Take that.

556
00:28:58,032 --> 00:28:59,696
- Danny, I swear to God.

557
00:28:59,696 --> 00:29:01,964
- Would you just...

558
00:29:01,964 --> 00:29:03,231
- Rob, get off me.

559
00:29:03,231 --> 00:29:04,291
Where is she?

560
00:29:04,291 --> 00:29:05,294
- Get in the car.

561
00:29:05,294 --> 00:29:06,550
- [Lydia] What the hell did you do?

562
00:29:06,550 --> 00:29:08,788
- [Rob] Just shut up, everything's cool.

563
00:29:08,788 --> 00:29:10,358
(engine revving)

564
00:29:10,358 --> 00:29:11,883
We gotta make it up there.

565
00:29:11,883 --> 00:29:13,887
- [Lydia] Where is she, Danny?

566
00:29:13,887 --> 00:29:17,031
- Stop asking questions, all right?

567
00:29:17,031 --> 00:29:19,864
(tires squealing)

568
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:30,408
- Is there anybody else
that we can talk to?

569
00:29:30,408 --> 00:29:32,623
Anybody else from the beauty parlor?

570
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:35,190
Okay, thank you.

571
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:37,190
Please let us know if you hear from her.

572
00:29:38,355 --> 00:29:40,250
- Don't you think we
should call the police?

573
00:29:40,250 --> 00:29:42,153
- No, Mom, you're getting
yourself all upset over nothing.

574
00:29:42,153 --> 00:29:44,970
- Your sister's been
missing for five hours.

575
00:29:44,970 --> 00:29:46,353
- Mom, she's fine.

576
00:29:47,293 --> 00:29:49,336
Look, call us when you hear from her.

577
00:29:49,336 --> 00:29:51,186
We have to go relieve the babysitter.

578
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:54,390
- Goodnight, Daddy.

579
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:57,770
- It's gonna be fine.

580
00:30:00,390 --> 00:30:01,843
- [Roger] It's gonna be okay, Mom.

581
00:30:03,550 --> 00:30:07,016
- Maybe I, maybe I should drive around,

582
00:30:07,016 --> 00:30:08,663
see if I can spot her car.

583
00:30:11,890 --> 00:30:12,840
- I'll go with you.

584
00:30:14,024 --> 00:30:15,024
- All right.

585
00:30:21,768 --> 00:30:24,268
(door closes)

586
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:27,420
- God, the stunts Sarah pulls.

587
00:30:27,420 --> 00:30:28,480
I can't believe I have to start

588
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:29,630
a new job tomorrow and now all I can do

589
00:30:29,630 --> 00:30:31,240
is think about her.

590
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:32,073
She's fine, right?

591
00:30:32,073 --> 00:30:33,993
- Yeah, yeah, she's gonna be fine.

592
00:30:35,112 --> 00:30:37,695
(gentle music)

593
00:30:47,382 --> 00:30:48,215
- Nothing.

594
00:30:53,872 --> 00:30:55,705
- I called the police.

595
00:30:57,233 --> 00:30:59,300
- Why? Why would you do that?

596
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:01,910
- They won't officially
list her as missing

597
00:31:01,910 --> 00:31:03,723
until she's gone for 24 hours.

598
00:31:04,870 --> 00:31:06,570
I did talk to Ben Warren.

599
00:31:06,570 --> 00:31:08,070
I gave him a description of the car

600
00:31:08,070 --> 00:31:10,710
and I told him what Sarah was wearing

601
00:31:11,696 --> 00:31:14,721
and he said he would do everything he can.

602
00:31:14,721 --> 00:31:17,304
(gentle music)

603
00:31:25,345 --> 00:31:27,947
(thunder rolling)

604
00:31:27,947 --> 00:31:30,697
(dramatic music)

605
00:31:42,004 --> 00:31:44,671
(siren blaring)

606
00:31:49,309 --> 00:31:53,181
- Be cool, just be cool.

607
00:31:53,181 --> 00:31:54,220
Evening, Officer.

608
00:31:54,220 --> 00:31:56,993
- There's an attempt
to locate on this car.

609
00:31:57,959 --> 00:31:59,805
Is there a Sarah Porter in this vehicle.

610
00:31:59,805 --> 00:32:02,013
- Yeah, I'm Sarah
Porter, I'm Sarah Porter.

611
00:32:02,013 --> 00:32:04,122
- Says here you're wearing a red sweater

612
00:32:04,122 --> 00:32:05,289
and tan pants.

613
00:32:07,570 --> 00:32:10,570
- You know what, I just changed, so.

614
00:32:11,517 --> 00:32:13,959
- Also a ring, heart shaped.

615
00:32:13,959 --> 00:32:15,459
- Yeah, see, ring.

616
00:32:20,615 --> 00:32:21,776
- Okay.

617
00:32:21,776 --> 00:32:22,609
- Okay.

618
00:32:22,609 --> 00:32:25,320
- Make sure to call your mom.

619
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:26,153
Drive safe.

620
00:32:26,153 --> 00:32:27,426
- [Lydia] Thanks.

621
00:32:34,776 --> 00:32:36,024
(phone ringing)

622
00:32:36,024 --> 00:32:37,191
- I'll get it.

623
00:32:39,992 --> 00:32:40,825
Yes?

624
00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:45,973
Thank God.

625
00:32:48,430 --> 00:32:49,263
Thank you.

626
00:32:51,395 --> 00:32:53,130
- [Sandy] What is she doing driving around

627
00:32:53,130 --> 00:32:55,170
with two guys, who are they?

628
00:32:55,170 --> 00:32:56,003
- I don't know.

629
00:32:56,003 --> 00:32:58,560
Maybe they're friends,
maybe it's a boyfriend.

630
00:32:58,560 --> 00:32:59,859
- Mom, Sarah doesn't have a boyfriend.

631
00:32:59,859 --> 00:33:02,453
- Maybe she does, maybe
she just didn't tell us.

632
00:33:03,570 --> 00:33:04,788
- What are they doing
in the middle of nowhere

633
00:33:04,788 --> 00:33:06,390
at 2 o'clock in the morning

634
00:33:06,390 --> 00:33:08,510
and why hasn't she called us?

635
00:33:08,510 --> 00:33:10,450
She obviously knows we're looking for her.

636
00:33:10,450 --> 00:33:11,640
The cops must have told her that

637
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:13,408
and besides didn't the cop say

638
00:33:13,408 --> 00:33:15,990
that one of the guys was driving.

639
00:33:15,990 --> 00:33:18,130
Sarah never lets anyone
behind the wheel of that car.

640
00:33:18,130 --> 00:33:19,800
She loves that car.

641
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:21,900
Mom, this just doesn't make any sense.

642
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:23,410
- What are you saying?

643
00:33:23,410 --> 00:33:24,790
That wasn't your sister in the car?

644
00:33:24,790 --> 00:33:26,787
- [Sandy] I don't know what I'm saying.

645
00:33:26,787 --> 00:33:28,863
I'm just thinking out loud.

646
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:32,050
Dad, what should we do?

647
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:36,353
- It's the middle of the night.

648
00:33:38,060 --> 00:33:39,860
There's nothing we can do right now.

649
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:46,700
(clock ticking)

650
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:49,200
(dog barking)

651
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:02,274
- I'm waiting for Ben
to get to the station.

652
00:34:02,274 --> 00:34:03,840
Then Sandy and I are gonna go see him.

653
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:04,763
He'll help us.

654
00:34:05,824 --> 00:34:09,003
- Honey, we're not even
sure that we need help.

655
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:11,360
- Fine, John.

656
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:13,010
You say here.

657
00:34:13,010 --> 00:34:14,410
Just ignore what's going on.

658
00:34:15,446 --> 00:34:16,896
We both know how you do that.

659
00:34:20,374 --> 00:34:21,207
I'm sorry.

660
00:34:23,590 --> 00:34:24,740
She's in trouble, John.

661
00:34:29,380 --> 00:34:31,947
- Natalie, I think you're
overreacting to this.

662
00:34:31,947 --> 00:34:33,700
I think you just gotta give her...

663
00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:36,553
- You remember when she was
little in the second grade.

664
00:34:37,570 --> 00:34:39,783
I was out shopping and I had

665
00:34:39,783 --> 00:34:43,160
this terrible feeling
something had happened to her.

666
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:45,100
I had to get to that school.

667
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:45,960
Do you remember?

668
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:48,183
She fell off the jungle
gym and broke her arm.

669
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:50,570
They'd been trying to reach me.

670
00:34:52,060 --> 00:34:54,710
I had a sixth sense about
Sarah, John, you know that.

671
00:34:57,997 --> 00:35:00,733
I have to go to the police.

672
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:04,203
Sarah wasn't in that car, I know it.

673
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:09,387
Sandy are you ready?

674
00:35:09,387 --> 00:35:12,288
- [Sandy] Come on, Mom, let's go.

675
00:35:12,288 --> 00:35:14,871
(gentle music)

676
00:35:38,422 --> 00:35:41,089
(phone ringing)

677
00:35:48,022 --> 00:35:48,855
- Hello?

678
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:51,833
Yeah, yeah.

679
00:35:53,910 --> 00:35:55,773
Yes, that's my daughter's car.

680
00:35:58,411 --> 00:36:00,270
Yeah, just a second, let me get something

681
00:36:00,270 --> 00:36:01,653
to write oh, hold on.

682
00:36:04,095 --> 00:36:05,845
Yeah, okay, go ahead.

683
00:36:07,284 --> 00:36:08,117
Yeah.

684
00:36:10,474 --> 00:36:11,307
Right.

685
00:36:14,670 --> 00:36:15,670
Thank you very much.

686
00:36:22,606 --> 00:36:25,189
(John sighing)

687
00:36:27,638 --> 00:36:29,430
- They found the car in the
worst section of Rockwater.

688
00:36:29,430 --> 00:36:31,430
You're damn lucky there's anything left.

689
00:36:34,070 --> 00:36:36,040
Somebody parked it right
next to a fire hydrant.

690
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:36,873
Not too bright.

691
00:36:40,340 --> 00:36:41,630
There's a $90 impound fee

692
00:36:41,630 --> 00:36:42,630
and then it's yours.

693
00:36:48,398 --> 00:36:51,148
(engine revving)

694
00:36:52,494 --> 00:36:55,077
(gentle music)

695
00:37:21,788 --> 00:37:22,855
- Are you sure he knows we're here.

696
00:37:22,855 --> 00:37:23,950
- [Woman] Yes, ma'am.

697
00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:25,436
- Mom, maybe we should
come back another time.

698
00:37:25,436 --> 00:37:26,500
They seem pretty busy.

699
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:28,400
- [Ben] Okay, Walt, I'll let you know.

700
00:37:30,210 --> 00:37:31,480
- Hello, Natalie.
- Ben.

701
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:32,423
- Thank you for seeing us.

702
00:37:32,423 --> 00:37:34,080
You remember my daughter, Sandy.

703
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:35,580
- Of course, Sandy, nice to see you again.

704
00:37:35,580 --> 00:37:37,100
Natalie, as soon as I got your phone call,

705
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:39,010
I got a report from the
North Adams precinct

706
00:37:39,010 --> 00:37:40,260
from an officer, George Colby.

707
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:41,733
Now he's the officer that
pulled Sarah's car over

708
00:37:41,733 --> 00:37:43,930
and everything seemed to be in order

709
00:37:43,930 --> 00:37:46,130
so I'm not sure I see
what the problem is here.

710
00:37:46,130 --> 00:37:47,790
- We don't think that
was Sarah in the car.

711
00:37:47,790 --> 00:37:49,242
She would have called home.

712
00:37:49,242 --> 00:37:51,520
It doesn't make sense
she'd be 50 miles from home

713
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:52,815
in the middle of the night.

714
00:37:52,815 --> 00:37:55,097
- Why don't we go inside?

715
00:37:55,097 --> 00:37:57,220
- Here's the file you asked for Ben.

716
00:37:57,220 --> 00:37:58,223
- Thank you.

717
00:37:58,223 --> 00:37:59,530
You know, Natalie, you're a good mom

718
00:37:59,530 --> 00:38:01,070
and good moms have a tendency to worry

719
00:38:01,070 --> 00:38:02,410
about their daughters even if

720
00:38:02,410 --> 00:38:05,400
they're just late from
the mall by half an hour.

721
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:06,960
- She's not late.

722
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:08,230
She's missing.

723
00:38:08,230 --> 00:38:09,359
Over 15 hours.

724
00:38:09,359 --> 00:38:11,258
This is not something Sarah would do.

725
00:38:11,258 --> 00:38:13,540
- No, it's something
she has done, Natalie.

726
00:38:13,540 --> 00:38:14,810
You don't remember that rock concert

727
00:38:14,810 --> 00:38:17,910
about two years ago, what
was she gone two days?

728
00:38:17,910 --> 00:38:19,080
- This is different.

729
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:20,410
She was just going to the florist.

730
00:38:20,410 --> 00:38:21,381
She was coming right back.

731
00:38:21,381 --> 00:38:22,940
(phone buzzing)

732
00:38:22,940 --> 00:38:23,773
- [Woman] Lieutenant?

733
00:38:23,773 --> 00:38:24,606
- Excuse me.

734
00:38:24,606 --> 00:38:26,200
Yeah, I'll be right there.

735
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:28,440
All right, look, here's
what I suggest you do.

736
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:30,070
I think you should probably go home

737
00:38:30,070 --> 00:38:31,430
and stay by the phone because I'm sure

738
00:38:31,430 --> 00:38:33,290
she's gonna be calling you.

739
00:38:33,290 --> 00:38:34,123
- [Woman] Ben we need you.

740
00:38:34,123 --> 00:38:36,760
- All right, all right, I'm on my way.

741
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:38,713
I'm sorry, Natalie, can you excuse me.

742
00:38:43,340 --> 00:38:44,650
- Ben.

743
00:38:44,650 --> 00:38:46,690
Something's happened to her.

744
00:38:46,690 --> 00:38:47,810
I know it.

745
00:38:47,810 --> 00:38:50,110
You have to put out a
missing person's report.

746
00:38:51,050 --> 00:38:53,490
- I can't put out a
missing person's report

747
00:38:53,490 --> 00:38:55,023
because Sarah's not missing.

748
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:57,033
Sandy.

749
00:39:01,076 --> 00:39:03,743
(phone ringing)

750
00:39:05,513 --> 00:39:07,846
- Come on, Amy, we gotta go.

751
00:39:09,023 --> 00:39:11,048
- I'm saving money to buy a house.

752
00:39:11,048 --> 00:39:12,598
A big one.

753
00:39:12,598 --> 00:39:15,607
- Oh, well, I will contribute

754
00:39:15,607 --> 00:39:18,477
if you promise me you'll
paint my room pink.

755
00:39:20,481 --> 00:39:22,388
Thank you.

756
00:39:22,388 --> 00:39:24,388
Come on, let's go again.

757
00:39:25,392 --> 00:39:28,202
(Lydia laughing)

758
00:39:28,202 --> 00:39:29,226
- Hey, Amy.

759
00:39:29,226 --> 00:39:30,257
- Hey, Danielle.

760
00:39:30,257 --> 00:39:31,593
Can I get a beer?

761
00:39:36,464 --> 00:39:38,655
- I want you to go into your room.

762
00:39:38,655 --> 00:39:39,658
- [Amy] But Mommy.

763
00:39:39,658 --> 00:39:40,922
- Now.
- Excuse me.

764
00:39:40,922 --> 00:39:43,040
- You're excused. I'm tired.

765
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:44,193
- Hey, Amy.

766
00:39:45,104 --> 00:39:47,687
(all laughing)

767
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:53,550
- Lydia, I want you and your buddies

768
00:39:53,550 --> 00:39:55,830
to get out of my house right now.

769
00:39:55,830 --> 00:39:57,410
- You mean you?

770
00:39:57,410 --> 00:39:59,440
- But this is my apartment, too.

771
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:00,582
- Dammit, get out of my house,

772
00:40:00,582 --> 00:40:02,566
right now Danny, get the
hell out of my apartment.

773
00:40:02,566 --> 00:40:03,547
- Danielle, would you chill, chill.

774
00:40:03,547 --> 00:40:05,590
- Oh, don't touch me.

775
00:40:05,590 --> 00:40:06,423
Shut up.

776
00:40:06,423 --> 00:40:07,730
- Would you stop it.

777
00:40:07,730 --> 00:40:09,677
Don't talk to my husband like that.

778
00:40:10,863 --> 00:40:13,280
- What are you talking about?

779
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:16,393
- Hey.

780
00:40:17,890 --> 00:40:19,290
- Last night we got married.

781
00:40:21,688 --> 00:40:23,408
- That's the truth, sis.

782
00:40:23,408 --> 00:40:25,252
- Watch the stuff.

783
00:40:25,252 --> 00:40:27,664
- Oh, God.

784
00:40:27,664 --> 00:40:29,371
- I'm sorry, Danielle.

785
00:40:29,371 --> 00:40:31,204
God, will you stop it.

786
00:40:38,150 --> 00:40:38,983
- Dad.

787
00:40:38,983 --> 00:40:39,816
- No, this is Ed.

788
00:40:39,816 --> 00:40:41,158
Is that you, Martha?

789
00:40:41,158 --> 00:40:42,854
- Yeah, is Mom or Dad there?

790
00:40:42,854 --> 00:40:45,077
- No, they're both gone.

791
00:40:45,077 --> 00:40:46,130
I'm not sure where.

792
00:40:46,130 --> 00:40:47,728
- Have you heard from Sarah.

793
00:40:47,728 --> 00:40:51,280
- No, no word from Sarah.

794
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:53,680
- Okay, will you tell them
that I called, please?

795
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:54,567
- I'll tell them.

796
00:40:54,567 --> 00:40:55,400
- Thanks.

797
00:41:03,083 --> 00:41:06,083
(upbeat rock music)

798
00:41:09,199 --> 00:41:11,642
- Yeah, no that's okay, man.

799
00:41:11,642 --> 00:41:13,870
I'm with it all the way, that's rockin'.

800
00:41:13,870 --> 00:41:14,703
Yeah.

801
00:41:15,710 --> 00:41:16,830
Brother, okay.

802
00:41:16,830 --> 00:41:18,570
No, no, no, I'll get back to you.

803
00:41:18,570 --> 00:41:19,993
Just let me know, cool.

804
00:41:21,470 --> 00:41:22,303
- What?

805
00:41:24,152 --> 00:41:25,549
(Lydia laughing)

806
00:41:25,549 --> 00:41:28,910
What are you, what are you doing?

807
00:41:28,910 --> 00:41:30,863
- Honolulu, Thursday.

808
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:32,913
- What?

809
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:38,243
- You see, now that we're married,

810
00:41:39,223 --> 00:41:40,973
I know how to take care of my wife.

811
00:41:42,350 --> 00:41:44,850
- Danny, how you gonna get
the money for Honolulu?

812
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:48,040
- Don't you worry about the money.

813
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:50,046
I got something worked out.

814
00:41:50,046 --> 00:41:51,413
- What, Danny?

815
00:41:55,776 --> 00:41:58,934
I think we're in enough
trouble already, don't you?

816
00:41:58,934 --> 00:42:00,039
- No.

817
00:42:00,039 --> 00:42:02,273
I don't think we're in trouble

818
00:42:02,273 --> 00:42:05,227
as long as nobody says nothing to nobody.

819
00:42:17,550 --> 00:42:18,873
- Officer George Colby.

820
00:42:20,660 --> 00:42:23,133
I got his name from the
Rockwater police station.

821
00:42:26,220 --> 00:42:27,970
Okay, then give me his home number.

822
00:42:30,610 --> 00:42:32,080
My daughter is missing.

823
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:33,523
He identified her.

824
00:42:35,210 --> 00:42:36,950
No, you don't understand,

825
00:42:36,950 --> 00:42:38,950
we're sure that wasn't her.

826
00:42:38,950 --> 00:42:40,900
Please, I have to talk to Officer Colby.

827
00:42:40,900 --> 00:42:43,143
Please, can't you connect me to his home?

828
00:42:45,530 --> 00:42:47,830
You're the police, you're
supposed to help me.

829
00:42:49,316 --> 00:42:51,242
They hung up on me.

830
00:42:51,242 --> 00:42:52,288
Where have you been?

831
00:42:52,288 --> 00:42:54,205
I've been worried sick.

832
00:42:55,833 --> 00:42:56,666
What?

833
00:42:57,589 --> 00:42:58,506
What is it?

834
00:43:01,079 --> 00:43:05,079
- They found Sarah's car
abandoned in Rockwater.

835
00:43:09,037 --> 00:43:10,120
- Oh, my God.

836
00:43:12,783 --> 00:43:14,313
- There's no sign of Sarah.

837
00:43:17,773 --> 00:43:19,647
That florist is four miles from here.

838
00:43:20,517 --> 00:43:24,093
Four miles, with a shopping
center full of people.

839
00:43:26,229 --> 00:43:27,610
I don't understand,

840
00:43:27,610 --> 00:43:28,923
I just don't understand.

841
00:43:30,870 --> 00:43:32,420
So what were the police saying?

842
00:43:33,513 --> 00:43:35,513
- They don't believe us.

843
00:43:36,790 --> 00:43:38,770
They keep saying she's not missing

844
00:43:38,770 --> 00:43:40,403
and the officer who supposedly saw her

845
00:43:40,403 --> 00:43:42,373
is off duty until tomorrow.

846
00:43:44,055 --> 00:43:46,955
- Well, so what are they gonna do?

847
00:43:46,955 --> 00:43:47,788
- Nothing.

848
00:43:53,541 --> 00:43:57,313
- All right, well, we'll
find her ourselves.

849
00:43:57,313 --> 00:43:59,896
(gentle music)

850
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:10,220
- I talked to the florist.

851
00:44:10,220 --> 00:44:13,230
He said she came in, paid
for the boutonniere and left.

852
00:44:13,230 --> 00:44:14,920
- Was she with anyone?

853
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:17,018
- No, and I talked to her friends again

854
00:44:17,018 --> 00:44:19,067
and they still haven't heard from her.

855
00:44:21,540 --> 00:44:24,123
(gentle music)

856
00:44:54,289 --> 00:44:55,122
- Sorry.

857
00:44:55,122 --> 00:44:57,705
(gentle music)

858
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:45,465
- You have to call Eric and get him

859
00:45:45,465 --> 00:45:47,690
to put Sarah's picture on the news.

860
00:45:47,690 --> 00:45:49,657
- Mom, we're barely
speaking to each other.

861
00:45:49,657 --> 00:45:51,470
- He produces the show, doesn't he?

862
00:45:51,470 --> 00:45:52,490
- We're separated.

863
00:45:52,490 --> 00:45:54,589
He won't even take my calls.

864
00:45:54,589 --> 00:45:56,140
- Then I guess you'll have
to go there in person.

865
00:45:56,140 --> 00:45:58,793
- Mom, please don't do this to me, please.

866
00:46:06,250 --> 00:46:09,590
- We have to hurry, it's gonna
be dark in a couple of hours.

867
00:46:09,590 --> 00:46:10,840
She's afraid of the dark.

868
00:46:11,860 --> 00:46:14,785
She's always been afraid of the dark.

869
00:46:14,785 --> 00:46:17,368
(gentle music)

870
00:46:26,454 --> 00:46:29,454
(suspenseful music)

871
00:47:16,066 --> 00:47:19,390
- The spotted puppy woke up first.

872
00:47:19,390 --> 00:47:22,273
He looked everywhere for his mother.

873
00:47:23,230 --> 00:47:25,180
For a minute he was scared,

874
00:47:25,180 --> 00:47:27,820
but then he heard her bark

875
00:47:27,820 --> 00:47:29,400
and he knew she was nearby.

876
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:30,370
- Lydia.

877
00:47:30,370 --> 00:47:31,923
I wanna talk to you right now.

878
00:47:34,559 --> 00:47:35,453
- Okay.

879
00:47:36,970 --> 00:47:38,686
Take your nap, my sweetie.

880
00:47:38,686 --> 00:47:39,603
I love you.

881
00:47:42,217 --> 00:47:43,800
See you in a while.

882
00:47:51,561 --> 00:47:52,894
What's going on?

883
00:47:54,183 --> 00:47:56,133
- What the hell is this?

884
00:47:57,872 --> 00:47:59,490
- Somebody's purse.

885
00:47:59,490 --> 00:48:00,943
- Sarah Porter's purse.

886
00:48:01,922 --> 00:48:03,572
Found it in the dumpster outside.

887
00:48:04,550 --> 00:48:05,610
Got a prescription box,

888
00:48:05,610 --> 00:48:06,893
got her name all over it.

889
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,840
Tell me how it got in there.

890
00:48:10,840 --> 00:48:11,700
- Who put it in there, Lydia?

891
00:48:11,700 --> 00:48:12,533
- All right.

892
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:16,810
Sarah gave me this purse
at the motel, all right

893
00:48:16,810 --> 00:48:18,380
and I don't know about that.

894
00:48:18,380 --> 00:48:20,810
There's prescriptions
inside, I don't know.

895
00:48:20,810 --> 00:48:23,460
- And you just threw this purse away?

896
00:48:23,460 --> 00:48:25,660
- Yeah, I don't like
it very much, Danielle.

897
00:48:26,580 --> 00:48:28,501
- I don't believe you.

898
00:48:28,501 --> 00:48:30,151
- Believe what you wanna believe.

899
00:48:38,310 --> 00:48:39,490
- Lydia.

900
00:48:39,490 --> 00:48:40,490
- What?

901
00:48:40,490 --> 00:48:41,603
- You gotta stop this.

902
00:48:43,180 --> 00:48:44,080
You gotta stop this.

903
00:48:44,080 --> 00:48:47,173
You left him once before
and you can do it again.

904
00:48:48,758 --> 00:48:49,693
I'll help you.

905
00:48:50,780 --> 00:48:53,425
I'll be there for you, I promise.

906
00:48:53,425 --> 00:48:54,907
- [Danny] Hey, Lydia!

907
00:48:54,907 --> 00:48:56,483
Lydia, you up there?

908
00:48:57,350 --> 00:48:58,183
- Yeah.

909
00:48:59,377 --> 00:49:00,977
- You're way too smart for this.

910
00:49:06,310 --> 00:49:07,143
- Hey.

911
00:49:08,849 --> 00:49:10,956
Hey, hey.

912
00:49:10,956 --> 00:49:12,326
- Hey.

913
00:49:12,326 --> 00:49:13,576
- You tell him.

914
00:49:15,099 --> 00:49:16,753
- Ooh.

915
00:49:16,753 --> 00:49:18,280
Uh-oh.

916
00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:21,407
I don't know, I don't know, I'll see you.

917
00:49:22,918 --> 00:49:25,670
I guess I just can't live like this.

918
00:49:25,670 --> 00:49:26,993
All right, I just can't.

919
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:29,350
Don't worry about me, all right, Danielle.

920
00:49:29,350 --> 00:49:30,183
Everything will be cool.

921
00:49:30,183 --> 00:49:32,100
I just think it'd be better.

922
00:49:32,100 --> 00:49:33,900
All right, come on, Danny, let's go.

923
00:49:37,005 --> 00:49:38,205
- [Danny] Well, wait up.

924
00:49:40,898 --> 00:49:42,970
(door closes)

925
00:49:42,970 --> 00:49:44,360
- Alicia, please think.

926
00:49:44,360 --> 00:49:45,990
Is there anyone else?

927
00:49:45,990 --> 00:49:47,160
I mean, did you ever hear her talk

928
00:49:47,160 --> 00:49:48,360
about any other friends?

929
00:49:49,260 --> 00:49:50,730
- Well, maybe.

930
00:49:50,730 --> 00:49:51,743
No, she wouldn't do that.

931
00:49:51,743 --> 00:49:53,113
- [John] Do what?

932
00:49:54,340 --> 00:49:57,890
- She had a boyfriend for a while, Chris.

933
00:49:57,890 --> 00:49:58,780
- Who?

934
00:49:58,780 --> 00:50:00,360
- Chris Prince.

935
00:50:00,360 --> 00:50:01,910
But that ended a long time ago.

936
00:50:05,370 --> 00:50:07,290
- Who is he? I've never heard of him.

937
00:50:07,290 --> 00:50:09,430
- Well, that doesn't surprise me.

938
00:50:09,430 --> 00:50:10,360
- Why?

939
00:50:10,360 --> 00:50:11,923
- She knew you wouldn't like him.

940
00:50:17,992 --> 00:50:20,825
(welder whirring)

941
00:50:29,210 --> 00:50:30,060
- Excuse me, hey.

942
00:50:31,489 --> 00:50:33,263
Hey, are you Chris Prince?

943
00:50:34,180 --> 00:50:35,383
- Hang on a second.

944
00:50:37,170 --> 00:50:38,723
- My daughter is Sarah Porter.

945
00:50:41,505 --> 00:50:43,490
Do you know where she is?

946
00:50:43,490 --> 00:50:45,360
- I have no idea where she is.

947
00:50:45,360 --> 00:50:46,460
- Well, she's missing.

948
00:50:47,470 --> 00:50:48,343
Sarah's missing.

949
00:50:49,191 --> 00:50:51,140
- I'm sorry, but I haven't talked to her

950
00:50:51,140 --> 00:50:52,223
in over two years.

951
00:50:54,033 --> 00:50:56,033
- We're looking for her.

952
00:50:57,307 --> 00:50:59,663
- I would like to help, but like I said.

953
00:51:01,310 --> 00:51:02,143
Are you okay?

954
00:51:03,439 --> 00:51:04,272
Mr. Porter?

955
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:06,033
Are you okay?

956
00:51:10,095 --> 00:51:12,762
(phone ringing)

957
00:51:20,810 --> 00:51:21,902
- He's okay.

958
00:51:21,902 --> 00:51:22,852
He's gonna be okay.

959
00:51:23,960 --> 00:51:25,400
He's sedated now.

960
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:26,532
- What about you?

961
00:51:26,532 --> 00:51:27,449
- I'm fine.

962
00:51:29,007 --> 00:51:31,290
I wanna get back in there.

963
00:51:31,290 --> 00:51:32,123
- I spoke to Ed.

964
00:51:32,123 --> 00:51:33,580
He said he could stay
at the motel tonight.

965
00:51:33,580 --> 00:51:34,460
- Good.

966
00:51:34,460 --> 00:51:36,996
- Well, I have to go,
'cause Matt's with a sitter.

967
00:51:36,996 --> 00:51:38,383
- Where's Roger?

968
00:51:38,383 --> 00:51:40,708
- On a business trip.

969
00:51:40,708 --> 00:51:43,033
Well, he tried to get
out it, but he couldn't.

970
00:51:43,033 --> 00:51:43,983
- Well, what time are you gonna be able

971
00:51:43,983 --> 00:51:45,956
to get here tomorrow?

972
00:51:45,956 --> 00:51:48,367
- Mom, I started a brand new job today.

973
00:51:48,367 --> 00:51:50,427
- This is family, Martha.

974
00:51:50,427 --> 00:51:51,680
Family comes first.

975
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:53,410
- No, Mom, Sarah's come first.

976
00:51:53,410 --> 00:51:54,543
She always has and she always will.

977
00:51:54,543 --> 00:51:56,290
- Don't you dare start this again.

978
00:51:56,290 --> 00:51:57,530
- Mom, this job is important to me.

979
00:51:57,530 --> 00:51:59,610
I have worked my whole life
to get a job like this.

980
00:51:59,610 --> 00:52:00,729
- More important than your sister.

981
00:52:00,729 --> 00:52:02,180
- Oh, that is so unfair, okay.

982
00:52:02,180 --> 00:52:04,540
I am always there, always.

983
00:52:04,540 --> 00:52:05,730
But I have responsibilities, too,

984
00:52:05,730 --> 00:52:06,624
and I'm not about to ignore them

985
00:52:06,624 --> 00:52:08,800
when I'm not even sure Sarah's in trouble.

986
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:11,709
She's cried wolf before,
Mom, too many times.

987
00:52:11,709 --> 00:52:13,702
- Fine.
- Mom, come on.

988
00:52:13,702 --> 00:52:15,619
- It's okay, it's okay.

989
00:52:21,242 --> 00:52:24,434
(phone ringing)

990
00:52:24,434 --> 00:52:27,101
(Martha crying)

991
00:52:49,889 --> 00:52:52,707
(monitor beeping)

992
00:52:52,707 --> 00:52:55,290
(gentle music)

993
00:53:01,602 --> 00:53:04,269
(John coughing)

994
00:53:12,148 --> 00:53:13,398
- Welcome back.

995
00:53:22,243 --> 00:53:23,076
- Sarah?

996
00:53:24,590 --> 00:53:26,490
Is Sarah home?

997
00:53:26,490 --> 00:53:27,860
- Not yet.

998
00:53:27,860 --> 00:53:29,183
She will be very soon.

999
00:53:30,446 --> 00:53:32,025
What are you doing?

1000
00:53:32,025 --> 00:53:33,251
- I gotta get outta here.

1001
00:53:33,251 --> 00:53:34,301
Where are my clothes?

1002
00:53:35,534 --> 00:53:36,367
- Shh, now don't act crazy.

1003
00:53:36,367 --> 00:53:37,393
- Where are my clothes?

1004
00:53:38,478 --> 00:53:39,311
- Shh.

1005
00:53:45,165 --> 00:53:45,998
Shh.

1006
00:53:47,138 --> 00:53:47,971
Look.

1007
00:53:49,420 --> 00:53:51,840
This wasn't another heart attack,

1008
00:53:51,840 --> 00:53:54,120
but the doctor said it is a warning.

1009
00:53:54,120 --> 00:53:55,963
You're pushing yourself too hard.

1010
00:53:57,120 --> 00:53:58,104
Rest.

1011
00:53:58,104 --> 00:53:59,426
Please.

1012
00:53:59,426 --> 00:54:00,823
- How am I gonna rest?

1013
00:54:02,680 --> 00:54:04,933
I can't just stay here and do nothing.

1014
00:54:07,250 --> 00:54:08,173
She's my daughter.

1015
00:54:13,314 --> 00:54:15,310
I'm supposed to be there for her.

1016
00:54:15,310 --> 00:54:17,110
I'm supposed to be there.

1017
00:54:17,110 --> 00:54:18,120
I'm supposed to be there to protect her.

1018
00:54:18,120 --> 00:54:20,120
I'm supposed to be there to keep her safe.

1019
00:54:21,804 --> 00:54:23,452
I'm supposed to...

1020
00:54:23,452 --> 00:54:26,119
(John groaning)

1021
00:54:41,884 --> 00:54:44,967
I remember my father's hospital room.

1022
00:54:49,063 --> 00:54:52,230
I remember he was laying there in bed.

1023
00:54:55,480 --> 00:54:58,637
All kinds of tubes coming
out of him, just like me.

1024
00:55:03,132 --> 00:55:04,882
I remember I was just

1025
00:55:10,523 --> 00:55:12,243
sitting there watching him.

1026
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:16,220
Watching him and,

1027
00:55:18,930 --> 00:55:19,763
and hoping.

1028
00:55:24,980 --> 00:55:25,813
Hoped.

1029
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:29,113
Just like you.

1030
00:55:32,570 --> 00:55:34,860
- I've been married to you for 30 years

1031
00:55:34,860 --> 00:55:38,600
and for 30 years you've
been waiting to die young

1032
00:55:38,600 --> 00:55:40,023
because your father did.

1033
00:55:41,394 --> 00:55:42,527
Well, you know what?

1034
00:55:44,017 --> 00:55:47,103
It hasn't happened and it's not going to.

1035
00:55:48,325 --> 00:55:53,325
- Now, you can push us
away as hard as you want.

1036
00:55:53,330 --> 00:55:57,573
We're not going anywhere
and neither are you.

1037
00:55:59,143 --> 00:56:01,726
(gentle music)

1038
00:56:07,783 --> 00:56:09,116
- She's my girl.

1039
00:56:12,621 --> 00:56:13,788
She's my girl.

1040
00:56:14,713 --> 00:56:17,296
(gentle music)

1041
00:56:24,254 --> 00:56:25,389
- The truth, Jan.

1042
00:56:25,389 --> 00:56:28,450
- That's right, Michael,
in fact four of them.

1043
00:56:28,450 --> 00:56:31,313
- [Man] And they actually
got married, the two pigs.

1044
00:56:32,395 --> 00:56:35,925
The one pig was really
hogging up the wedding cake.

1045
00:56:35,925 --> 00:56:37,577
- Oh, that just shows you.

1046
00:56:37,577 --> 00:56:39,270
- I wonder if that was...

1047
00:56:39,270 --> 00:56:40,439
- We thought maybe you
could put her picture

1048
00:56:40,439 --> 00:56:44,400
on the news as a missing person.

1049
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:45,233
- Sandy, I'm confused.

1050
00:56:45,233 --> 00:56:46,455
I thought you just said
she wasn't missing.

1051
00:56:46,455 --> 00:56:49,763
- No, the police don't think
she's missing, but we do.

1052
00:56:50,630 --> 00:56:51,800
- I don't get it.

1053
00:56:51,800 --> 00:56:53,830
Is this some kind of sick joke?

1054
00:56:53,830 --> 00:56:55,380
To be honest, you know,
I've never really gotten

1055
00:56:55,380 --> 00:56:56,740
your sense of human.

1056
00:56:56,740 --> 00:56:57,975
Excuse me.

1057
00:56:57,975 --> 00:56:59,189
- It's not about us, Eric.

1058
00:56:59,189 --> 00:57:00,810
This is about Sarah.

1059
00:57:00,810 --> 00:57:02,740
- Well, until the police
list her as missing,

1060
00:57:02,740 --> 00:57:03,640
then she's not missing,

1061
00:57:03,640 --> 00:57:05,271
so there's nothing I can do about it.

1062
00:57:05,271 --> 00:57:07,340
- [Woman] Eric Cosner, pick up line two.

1063
00:57:07,340 --> 00:57:08,733
Call on line two.

1064
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:11,240
- Cosner.

1065
00:57:11,240 --> 00:57:12,670
Yeah, hold on.

1066
00:57:12,670 --> 00:57:14,680
Sandy, I know your family.

1067
00:57:14,680 --> 00:57:16,560
You're getting yourself all
hysterical over nothing.

1068
00:57:16,560 --> 00:57:17,560
I've seen it before.

1069
00:57:18,680 --> 00:57:20,488
Hell, I've lived it before.

1070
00:57:20,488 --> 00:57:21,321
- [Sandy] Eric.

1071
00:57:21,321 --> 00:57:23,210
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, what is it?

1072
00:57:23,210 --> 00:57:24,760
- I'm sorry I wasted your time.

1073
00:57:42,392 --> 00:57:44,500
- Listen, what's so important?

1074
00:57:44,500 --> 00:57:47,255
- Danielle, Lydia's sister.

1075
00:57:47,255 --> 00:57:49,800
She found that girl's purse.

1076
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:53,020
And now she's walking around
acting like she knows something

1077
00:57:54,324 --> 00:57:55,817
and I talked to Lydia

1078
00:57:55,817 --> 00:57:57,300
and she says she didn't say nothing,

1079
00:57:57,300 --> 00:57:58,807
but I just wanna make sure.

1080
00:57:58,807 --> 00:58:01,733
I just wanna talk to her, you know.

1081
00:58:01,733 --> 00:58:03,253
Hey, could we order, please.

1082
00:58:04,887 --> 00:58:06,060
- What the hell are you two doing here?

1083
00:58:06,060 --> 00:58:08,340
- Service with smile.

1084
00:58:08,340 --> 00:58:09,250
- Yeah, it leaves a little something

1085
00:58:09,250 --> 00:58:10,400
to be desired, don't it?

1086
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:11,233
- You need to get the hell outta here

1087
00:58:11,233 --> 00:58:12,327
or I'm gonna call the manager.

1088
00:58:12,327 --> 00:58:13,990
- Oh, why?

1089
00:58:13,990 --> 00:58:15,036
What, we do something wrong?

1090
00:58:15,036 --> 00:58:16,039
What did we do?

1091
00:58:16,039 --> 00:58:18,663
- I didn't do anything.

1092
00:58:18,663 --> 00:58:20,273
- I know you think you got Lydia, Danny,

1093
00:58:20,273 --> 00:58:21,333
but you don't.

1094
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:24,470
- Jeez, Danielle.

1095
00:58:24,470 --> 00:58:26,540
How long has it been since you have it?

1096
00:58:27,948 --> 00:58:28,781
- Mm-mm.

1097
00:58:30,277 --> 00:58:32,160
- 'Cause I can hook you
up with my buddy, here.

1098
00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:32,993
- Shut up.

1099
00:58:36,441 --> 00:58:38,191
I'll take care of it.

1100
00:58:39,447 --> 00:58:40,973
- All right.

1101
00:58:40,973 --> 00:58:41,806
You do that.

1102
00:58:41,806 --> 00:58:43,723
- I'll take care of it.

1103
00:58:46,627 --> 00:58:48,550
- [Sandy] I don't know why I expected him

1104
00:58:48,550 --> 00:58:50,550
to come through for me now.

1105
00:58:50,550 --> 00:58:53,270
- The nurses promised to keep
a close eye on your father.

1106
00:58:53,270 --> 00:58:54,770
I feel helpless just sitting there.

1107
00:58:54,770 --> 00:58:57,580
- Mom, this might not be such a good idea.

1108
00:58:57,580 --> 00:58:59,667
I think we'd be better off
waiting at the motel instead

1109
00:58:59,667 --> 00:59:01,540
of driving all the way to North Adams.

1110
00:59:01,540 --> 00:59:03,713
- Ed's at the motel, he'll get any call.

1111
00:59:05,660 --> 00:59:06,493
- Hi.

1112
00:59:07,656 --> 00:59:12,093
I, um, I looked at my baby sleeping safely

1113
00:59:12,093 --> 00:59:13,530
in his bed last night

1114
00:59:13,530 --> 00:59:17,337
and hmm, one day on the
job and I call in sick.

1115
00:59:21,690 --> 00:59:23,213
There's goes employee of the month.

1116
00:59:26,487 --> 00:59:28,223
I'm so glad daddy's okay.

1117
00:59:30,193 --> 00:59:31,810
- If I can just talk to them in person,

1118
00:59:31,810 --> 00:59:33,633
I know they'll listen to me.

1119
00:59:36,750 --> 00:59:38,150
We are not leaving that police station

1120
00:59:38,150 --> 00:59:40,270
till I see Officer Colby.

1121
00:59:40,270 --> 00:59:41,103
- Mom, I, I, I-

1122
00:59:41,103 --> 00:59:43,030
- I want him to look at the flyer

1123
00:59:43,030 --> 00:59:44,418
and then look me in the face

1124
00:59:44,418 --> 00:59:46,520
and tell me that that was Sarah

1125
00:59:46,520 --> 00:59:47,650
in that car Sunday.

1126
00:59:47,650 --> 00:59:50,233
(horn blowing)

1127
00:59:55,285 --> 00:59:58,285
(suspenseful music)

1128
01:00:16,901 --> 01:00:18,155
(phone ringing)

1129
01:00:18,155 --> 01:00:18,988
Please.

1130
01:00:20,190 --> 01:00:23,670
- Ma'am, I told you on
the phone a dozen times,

1131
01:00:23,670 --> 01:00:25,957
Colby doesn't start his shift till 11.

1132
01:00:25,957 --> 01:00:27,685
- Well, maybe you could
give me his home number

1133
01:00:27,685 --> 01:00:29,275
or the address, I'll just go there.

1134
01:00:29,275 --> 01:00:33,343
- Look, I'm gonna give you
a piece of advice, back off.

1135
01:00:34,350 --> 01:00:35,370
- Back off?

1136
01:00:35,370 --> 01:00:36,593
- You're way out of line.

1137
01:00:37,573 --> 01:00:39,710
- Something has happened to my daughter.

1138
01:00:39,710 --> 01:00:41,797
Your Officer Colby is
the only person who knows

1139
01:00:41,797 --> 01:00:44,890
if Sarah was in that car.

1140
01:00:44,890 --> 01:00:46,120
You won't let me talk

1141
01:00:46,120 --> 01:00:47,790
to the only person who can help me

1142
01:00:47,790 --> 01:00:49,283
and I'm out of line.

1143
01:00:54,150 --> 01:00:56,750
- Mom, um, why don't we go
get a cup of coffee and come-

1144
01:00:56,750 --> 01:00:57,583
- No.

1145
01:00:58,905 --> 01:00:59,980
I am not leaving this spot

1146
01:00:59,980 --> 01:01:01,230
until I talk to that man.

1147
01:01:03,110 --> 01:01:04,628
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

1148
01:01:04,628 --> 01:01:08,080
Don't eat this 'cause I
haven't paid for them yet.

1149
01:01:08,080 --> 01:01:09,590
- Mommy, you forgot the
chocolate chip cookies.

1150
01:01:09,590 --> 01:01:12,163
- No, you said you wanted donuts.

1151
01:01:12,163 --> 01:01:14,330
- I got my own money.

1152
01:01:14,330 --> 01:01:15,233
- Good for you.

1153
01:01:16,330 --> 01:01:17,163
Come on.

1154
01:01:17,163 --> 01:01:18,630
Chocolate chip cookies are next week.

1155
01:01:18,630 --> 01:01:19,769
Here, grab the tomatoes.

1156
01:01:19,769 --> 01:01:20,602
- I can buy them.

1157
01:01:20,602 --> 01:01:21,570
- Good.

1158
01:01:21,570 --> 01:01:24,487
I'm gonna go get some
shampoo, just do the tomatoes.

1159
01:01:30,670 --> 01:01:31,503
Excuse me.

1160
01:01:37,673 --> 01:01:38,506
Yes.

1161
01:01:40,590 --> 01:01:41,453
Okay.

1162
01:01:44,810 --> 01:01:45,643
Amy?

1163
01:01:48,210 --> 01:01:50,103
Amy, come on, I gotta go.

1164
01:01:53,320 --> 01:01:54,623
Amy, this isn't funny.

1165
01:01:56,460 --> 01:01:57,293
Amy?

1166
01:01:59,825 --> 01:02:00,843
Excuse me.

1167
01:02:00,843 --> 01:02:01,676
Amy!

1168
01:02:03,787 --> 01:02:04,620
Amy!

1169
01:02:08,672 --> 01:02:09,505
Amy!

1170
01:02:10,580 --> 01:02:11,774
- [Clerk] Can I help you with something?

1171
01:02:11,774 --> 01:02:12,767
- I can't find my kid.

1172
01:02:12,767 --> 01:02:14,101
- What's the name?

1173
01:02:14,101 --> 01:02:14,934
- Amy.

1174
01:02:14,934 --> 01:02:15,767
- I'll page her.

1175
01:02:15,767 --> 01:02:16,763
- Amy, hey Amy.

1176
01:02:16,763 --> 01:02:18,427
- Will you come to the front of the store?

1177
01:02:18,427 --> 01:02:20,927
Your mother's looking for you.

1178
01:02:22,587 --> 01:02:23,420
- Damn.

1179
01:02:25,850 --> 01:02:29,003
Don't you ever do that to me again.

1180
01:02:32,010 --> 01:02:33,603
- The ride's not over yet.

1181
01:02:35,684 --> 01:02:39,020
And even when it is, kids
just seem to like me.

1182
01:02:39,910 --> 01:02:43,398
Maybe it's because they
know how much I like them.

1183
01:02:43,398 --> 01:02:44,315
Right, Amy?

1184
01:02:47,771 --> 01:02:50,283
Maybe next time, we'll get to go

1185
01:02:50,283 --> 01:02:52,273
on a real horsey back ride.

1186
01:02:54,385 --> 01:02:57,437
Of course that next time
is up to your mommy.

1187
01:03:03,910 --> 01:03:04,743
- Okay.

1188
01:03:05,616 --> 01:03:07,213
It's okay.

1189
01:03:07,213 --> 01:03:08,130
Okie dokie.

1190
01:03:10,609 --> 01:03:11,526
Okie dokie.

1191
01:03:13,783 --> 01:03:15,289
(doctor knocking)

1192
01:03:15,289 --> 01:03:17,910
- Mr. Porter, I'm Dr. Greenwood.

1193
01:03:17,910 --> 01:03:19,280
Your physician was called into surgery

1194
01:03:19,280 --> 01:03:21,307
and asked me to take a look at you.

1195
01:03:21,307 --> 01:03:23,000
- When am I getting released?

1196
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:24,480
- I'm afraid that Dr.
McPherson is gonna have

1197
01:03:24,480 --> 01:03:25,567
to make that call.

1198
01:03:26,980 --> 01:03:28,783
What's a matter, the food getting you now?

1199
01:03:30,520 --> 01:03:32,620
- My daughter's missing, I wanna find her.

1200
01:03:33,510 --> 01:03:35,020
- I'm sorry, I didn't know that.

1201
01:03:35,020 --> 01:03:36,370
- I've got three daughters.

1202
01:03:37,670 --> 01:03:38,720
Sarah's the youngest.

1203
01:03:42,770 --> 01:03:44,120
- I'm sure she's just fine.

1204
01:03:47,174 --> 01:03:48,007
- Yeah.

1205
01:04:06,220 --> 01:04:07,053
- Officer Colby.

1206
01:04:09,550 --> 01:04:11,310
- You wanted to see me?

1207
01:04:11,310 --> 01:04:12,930
- Officer Colby?

1208
01:04:12,930 --> 01:04:13,763
I'm Natalie Porter.

1209
01:04:13,763 --> 01:04:15,470
You stopped my daughter's
car Sunday night.

1210
01:04:15,470 --> 01:04:17,605
- I know who you are, I got your messages.

1211
01:04:17,605 --> 01:04:19,540
- Please, take a look at this picture.

1212
01:04:19,540 --> 01:04:20,683
Look closely, please.

1213
01:04:21,830 --> 01:04:24,850
Tell me that's the girl
in the car two nights ago.

1214
01:04:24,850 --> 01:04:25,683
- That's her.

1215
01:04:26,850 --> 01:04:28,560
- You hardly looked at it.

1216
01:04:28,560 --> 01:04:30,450
- That's here, that's the girl I spoke to.

1217
01:04:30,450 --> 01:04:31,590
- You're 100% sure?

1218
01:04:31,590 --> 01:04:33,500
- 100%, no.

1219
01:04:33,500 --> 01:04:35,380
95, you bet.

1220
01:04:35,380 --> 01:04:36,830
You'll have to excuse me now.

1221
01:04:39,386 --> 01:04:41,000
- Did he make a fist or-
- Hey, Joe.

1222
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:41,833
- Hey, George.

1223
01:04:43,410 --> 01:04:45,057
I'm sorry, ma'am.

1224
01:04:46,827 --> 01:04:49,840
- Excuse me, Officer Colby, please.

1225
01:04:49,840 --> 01:04:50,940
One more look, please.

1226
01:04:53,790 --> 01:04:56,300
- That's her, that's the girl I spoke to.

1227
01:04:56,300 --> 01:04:58,033
Cute, brown hair, blue eyes.

1228
01:05:00,290 --> 01:05:02,600
- My daughter has brown
eyes, she has brown eyes.

1229
01:05:02,600 --> 01:05:04,420
- Oh, it was dark.

1230
01:05:04,420 --> 01:05:06,560
She had that heart-shaped ring

1231
01:05:06,560 --> 01:05:08,743
and that small tattoo on her hand.

1232
01:05:11,380 --> 01:05:13,180
- My daughter doesn't have a tattoo.

1233
01:05:15,541 --> 01:05:17,504
(phone ringing)

1234
01:05:17,504 --> 01:05:18,337
- Esterly.

1235
01:05:18,337 --> 01:05:19,170
- Yeah.

1236
01:05:19,170 --> 01:05:21,420
- I think you'd better
listen to Mrs. Porter.

1237
01:05:27,072 --> 01:05:28,240
- Within five minutes' time,

1238
01:05:28,240 --> 01:05:29,494
every precinct in this state will know

1239
01:05:29,494 --> 01:05:31,080
who Sarah Porter is

1240
01:05:31,080 --> 01:05:33,810
and every officer will be looking for her.

1241
01:05:33,810 --> 01:05:35,750
I want you to know that I'm
sorry about this, Mrs. Porter.

1242
01:05:35,750 --> 01:05:37,230
- You're wasting time, Officer,

1243
01:05:37,230 --> 01:05:39,040
find my daughter, then apologize.

1244
01:05:39,040 --> 01:05:40,177
- I have to go the office,

1245
01:05:40,177 --> 01:05:41,230
but I'll drop you guys off

1246
01:05:41,230 --> 01:05:42,080
and catch up with you later.

1247
01:05:42,080 --> 01:05:44,773
- We better hurry, I need
to make a stop first.

1248
01:05:46,038 --> 01:05:48,621
(gentle music)

1249
01:05:53,200 --> 01:05:54,090
- Well, pull the remote

1250
01:05:54,090 --> 01:05:56,340
and have them get down
to the courthouse now.

1251
01:05:57,870 --> 01:05:59,523
No, not in five minutes, now.

1252
01:06:02,860 --> 01:06:04,150
- [Sandy] I need to talk to you, Eric.

1253
01:06:04,150 --> 01:06:05,630
- Oh, not now.

1254
01:06:05,630 --> 01:06:06,580
- It'll only take a minute.

1255
01:06:06,580 --> 01:06:08,203
This is the APB on Sarah.

1256
01:06:08,203 --> 01:06:09,608
The North Adams Police Department

1257
01:06:09,608 --> 01:06:11,960
has officially listed her as missing.

1258
01:06:11,960 --> 01:06:12,980
- Sandy, there's been a break

1259
01:06:12,980 --> 01:06:14,120
in that molestation trial.

1260
01:06:14,120 --> 01:06:15,691
There's also a small plane
crash out on the highway

1261
01:06:15,691 --> 01:06:17,093
and I'm up to my ass in all of this.

1262
01:06:17,093 --> 01:06:19,340
Now, I'm sorry about Sarah, I really am.

1263
01:06:19,340 --> 01:06:21,580
- It's just that she's
not important enough,

1264
01:06:21,580 --> 01:06:23,600
is that what you were gonna say?

1265
01:06:23,600 --> 01:06:26,176
She's not important enough
to put on your news.

1266
01:06:26,176 --> 01:06:28,333
This is my sister, Eric.

1267
01:06:29,180 --> 01:06:30,930
She's part of my family.

1268
01:06:30,930 --> 01:06:32,981
She was part of your family for five years

1269
01:06:32,981 --> 01:06:35,410
and she's in trouble and you can help her.

1270
01:06:35,410 --> 01:06:36,590
You can help us.

1271
01:06:36,590 --> 01:06:40,080
Now I want you to put
her picture on the news.

1272
01:06:40,080 --> 01:06:41,690
I want you to do that for her

1273
01:06:42,980 --> 01:06:44,767
because you owe her that.

1274
01:06:44,767 --> 01:06:47,350
(gentle music)

1275
01:07:06,292 --> 01:07:08,709
(door opens)

1276
01:07:09,599 --> 01:07:12,099
(door closes)

1277
01:07:13,770 --> 01:07:15,180
- Where the hell have you been?

1278
01:07:15,180 --> 01:07:16,020
- What do you mean where have I been?

1279
01:07:16,020 --> 01:07:17,117
I told you I had to go see somebody.

1280
01:07:17,117 --> 01:07:19,520
- Danielle just called
me from work an hour ago.

1281
01:07:19,520 --> 01:07:21,340
She said that Rob tried to take Amy.

1282
01:07:21,340 --> 01:07:22,270
What is that, Danny?

1283
01:07:22,270 --> 01:07:23,310
- You know if I wasn't here right now,

1284
01:07:23,310 --> 01:07:24,143
she's be trying to tell you

1285
01:07:24,143 --> 01:07:25,540
that I was taking Amy, honey.

1286
01:07:25,540 --> 01:07:26,930
- You promised that you would not involve

1287
01:07:26,930 --> 01:07:27,860
my sister in this, you promised me.

1288
01:07:27,860 --> 01:07:28,863
I can't believe this.

1289
01:07:28,863 --> 01:07:30,331
- Listen, all your sister has to do

1290
01:07:30,331 --> 01:07:31,975
is keep your nose out of our business.

1291
01:07:31,975 --> 01:07:35,498
- But you don't know nothing.

1292
01:07:35,498 --> 01:07:36,331
- What?

1293
01:07:36,331 --> 01:07:37,793
- I just can't deal with this.

1294
01:07:45,300 --> 01:07:46,900
Why don't we leave or something?

1295
01:07:53,962 --> 01:07:54,795
- Okay.

1296
01:07:57,260 --> 01:07:58,093
Okay.

1297
01:07:58,983 --> 01:08:00,083
I'll call the airline.

1298
01:08:01,430 --> 01:08:02,263
I'll hook it up right now.

1299
01:08:02,263 --> 01:08:03,583
- Okay.

1300
01:08:03,583 --> 01:08:05,264
- I'll call him now, we'll go tonight,

1301
01:08:05,264 --> 01:08:06,097
we'll meet tonight.

1302
01:08:06,097 --> 01:08:07,007
- Mm-hmm.

1303
01:08:07,007 --> 01:08:08,674
- Okay?
- Okay, yeah.

1304
01:08:10,449 --> 01:08:11,661
- Hey, come on, honey.

1305
01:08:11,661 --> 01:08:15,270
- You know what? I just wanna be alone.

1306
01:08:15,270 --> 01:08:17,853
(gentle music)

1307
01:08:23,790 --> 01:08:24,623
- Okay.

1308
01:08:28,561 --> 01:08:29,561
Bloody Mary.

1309
01:08:33,985 --> 01:08:35,648
- [Reporter] The shortage
of rainfall this season

1310
01:08:35,648 --> 01:08:38,979
has left the area particularly
dry and vulnerable to fire.

1311
01:08:38,979 --> 01:08:41,198
We'll have a detailed
update on the efforts

1312
01:08:41,198 --> 01:08:43,502
to contain the fires and the weather.

1313
01:08:43,502 --> 01:08:46,207
On the local front, a
local family have contacted

1314
01:08:46,207 --> 01:08:47,040
the state's attorney

1315
01:08:47,040 --> 01:08:48,714
for a potential tragic accident.

1316
01:08:48,714 --> 01:08:51,561
Local resident, Sarah Porter
has been reported missing

1317
01:08:51,561 --> 01:08:53,691
from her family home for the past 46 hours

1318
01:08:53,691 --> 01:08:56,948
and is now thought to be
the victim of kidnapping.

1319
01:08:56,948 --> 01:08:59,047
- I hope I'm not
disturbing you, Mr. Porter.

1320
01:08:59,047 --> 01:09:01,450
The manager at your motel told
me where I could find you.

1321
01:09:01,450 --> 01:09:03,434
- No, no, Danielle, it's okay.

1322
01:09:03,434 --> 01:09:04,353
What is it?

1323
01:09:07,144 --> 01:09:08,670
- Oh, I can't believe I'm gonna say this

1324
01:09:08,670 --> 01:09:09,793
about my own sister.

1325
01:09:11,240 --> 01:09:12,623
- What? Tell me.

1326
01:09:20,383 --> 01:09:23,200
Where are they, Danielle.

1327
01:09:23,200 --> 01:09:24,350
Tell me where they are.

1328
01:09:26,068 --> 01:09:28,010
- I don't know.

1329
01:09:28,010 --> 01:09:30,010
I'm sorry, I don't know.

1330
01:09:31,476 --> 01:09:32,799
- Mom, you're exhausted.

1331
01:09:32,799 --> 01:09:34,378
You need some rest.

1332
01:09:34,378 --> 01:09:36,703
You're not gonna be any good to anybody

1333
01:09:36,703 --> 01:09:37,898
if you keep going at this pace.

1334
01:09:37,898 --> 01:09:38,731
- I'm fine.

1335
01:09:38,731 --> 01:09:41,371
It's your father that needs rest.

1336
01:09:41,371 --> 01:09:43,121
I hope he's sleeping.

1337
01:09:47,423 --> 01:09:50,173
(dramatic music)

1338
01:09:57,865 --> 01:10:00,782
- Yeah, thanks, keep that.
- Thanks.

1339
01:10:07,635 --> 01:10:10,227
- John, I thought you
were in the hospital?

1340
01:10:10,227 --> 01:10:12,227
What are you doing here?

1341
01:10:20,133 --> 01:10:23,459
(engine revving)

1342
01:10:23,459 --> 01:10:26,209
(dramatic music)

1343
01:10:39,620 --> 01:10:42,100
- Natalie, all I know is
that a woman called here.

1344
01:10:42,100 --> 01:10:44,056
It sounded urgent to me

1345
01:10:44,056 --> 01:10:46,659
so I gave her John's
number at the hospital.

1346
01:10:46,659 --> 01:10:48,195
20 minutes later, he storms in,

1347
01:10:48,195 --> 01:10:50,140
then storms back out.

1348
01:10:50,140 --> 01:10:51,590
Never said a word.

1349
01:10:51,590 --> 01:10:52,733
- What was her name?

1350
01:10:53,624 --> 01:10:56,124
Ed, what was the woman's name?

1351
01:10:57,464 --> 01:10:59,939
- Natalie, I don't remember her name.

1352
01:10:59,939 --> 01:11:01,856
- You have to remember.

1353
01:11:02,716 --> 01:11:04,466
We'll be right there.

1354
01:11:10,546 --> 01:11:11,379
- Lydia.

1355
01:11:13,217 --> 01:11:14,248
Lydia, answer me.

1356
01:11:14,248 --> 01:11:15,665
- She's not here.

1357
01:11:18,774 --> 01:11:20,024
- Where is she?

1358
01:11:23,690 --> 01:11:25,113
- She's out doing an errand.

1359
01:11:26,070 --> 01:11:27,370
She'll be back in a while.

1360
01:11:29,460 --> 01:11:30,293
- What's this.

1361
01:11:32,140 --> 01:11:32,973
- Huh?

1362
01:11:32,973 --> 01:11:34,480
- What's this stuff?

1363
01:11:34,480 --> 01:11:36,100
- Well, we're leaving.

1364
01:11:36,100 --> 01:11:38,420
Isn't that what you want us to do?

1365
01:11:38,420 --> 01:11:39,393
- You bastard.

1366
01:11:40,560 --> 01:11:42,160
What'd you do to that girl, huh?

1367
01:11:43,219 --> 01:11:45,780
You know what, her picture's
all over the TV, Danny.

1368
01:11:45,780 --> 01:11:47,020
And they're gonna come looking for you

1369
01:11:47,020 --> 01:11:49,157
and they're gonna find you
'cause I'm gonna help them.

1370
01:11:49,157 --> 01:11:51,022
- Hey.

1371
01:11:51,022 --> 01:11:52,022
Pretty girl.

1372
01:11:56,184 --> 01:11:58,767
(Amy whimpers)

1373
01:12:00,354 --> 01:12:02,573
Pretty girl, pretty girl,

1374
01:12:02,573 --> 01:12:05,272
won't you be my pretty girl.

1375
01:12:05,272 --> 01:12:07,821
Pretty girl, pretty girl.

1376
01:12:07,821 --> 01:12:10,571
(dramatic music)

1377
01:12:22,402 --> 01:12:24,985
(horn blowing)

1378
01:12:26,510 --> 01:12:28,260
- How could you let him
just walk out of here?

1379
01:12:28,260 --> 01:12:29,420
- I couldn't do anything about it

1380
01:12:29,420 --> 01:12:30,253
- He's been in the hospital,

1381
01:12:30,253 --> 01:12:32,300
you know he's been sick.

1382
01:12:32,300 --> 01:12:33,133
- Mom.

1383
01:12:33,133 --> 01:12:34,853
- Where is he? What is he doing?

1384
01:12:36,879 --> 01:12:37,813
Sorry, Ed.

1385
01:12:38,900 --> 01:12:41,000
I don't even know what I'm saying anymore.

1386
01:12:46,200 --> 01:12:48,867
(engine idling)

1387
01:12:55,277 --> 01:12:58,120
- Just stay right there,
I'll be right down.

1388
01:12:58,120 --> 01:13:00,150
- [Lydia] Wait, I just wanna
say goodbye or something.

1389
01:13:00,150 --> 01:13:02,115
- No, your sister just
left with Amy, honey.

1390
01:13:02,115 --> 01:13:03,840
Just send her a postcard,
I'll be right there.

1391
01:13:03,840 --> 01:13:05,112
Just hold on a second.

1392
01:13:05,112 --> 01:13:06,136
I just go through a couple things

1393
01:13:06,136 --> 01:13:07,553
in the bag there.

1394
01:13:17,007 --> 01:13:19,009
- We'll just wait for them to take off

1395
01:13:19,009 --> 01:13:23,430
and then you and me and your mommy

1396
01:13:23,430 --> 01:13:26,600
will go for a long ride.

1397
01:13:26,600 --> 01:13:29,350
(dramatic music)

1398
01:14:02,123 --> 01:14:05,373
You brought this on yourself, you know.

1399
01:14:14,360 --> 01:14:18,040
- Maybe he heard
something good, some lead.

1400
01:14:18,040 --> 01:14:18,873
- Doesn't make sense.

1401
01:14:18,873 --> 01:14:20,160
He would have left a message.

1402
01:14:21,136 --> 01:14:22,793
- Excuse me, Mrs. Porter.

1403
01:14:24,100 --> 01:14:26,560
I was just listening
to the radio in my car

1404
01:14:26,560 --> 01:14:28,270
and I heard about Sarah.

1405
01:14:28,270 --> 01:14:32,730
Well, I saw her, Sarah,
on Sunday at Rockwater

1406
01:14:32,730 --> 01:14:33,648
in the shopping center.

1407
01:14:33,648 --> 01:14:36,688
Yeah, she was with the, those people

1408
01:14:36,688 --> 01:14:37,930
that stayed here,

1409
01:14:37,930 --> 01:14:42,513
the ones whose house
burned down, you know.

1410
01:14:44,719 --> 01:14:47,510
- Ed, the woman who called,

1411
01:14:47,510 --> 01:14:49,283
was her name Lydia or Danielle?

1412
01:14:50,690 --> 01:14:52,590
- Danielle, that was it?

1413
01:14:52,590 --> 01:14:54,913
- She gave me her address,
it's in the cash box.

1414
01:14:55,920 --> 01:14:56,753
- Who are you calling?

1415
01:14:56,753 --> 01:14:57,633
- The police.

1416
01:15:01,455 --> 01:15:02,288
That's it.

1417
01:15:03,351 --> 01:15:06,101
(dramatic music)

1418
01:15:36,110 --> 01:15:38,713
- I'll call you, Rob, okay?

1419
01:15:39,670 --> 01:15:42,170
(doors close)

1420
01:15:44,150 --> 01:15:46,748
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, get in the car.

1421
01:15:46,748 --> 01:15:47,581
- Wait a minute.

1422
01:15:47,581 --> 01:15:49,270
- [Danny] Get in the car.

1423
01:15:49,270 --> 01:15:50,103
- Where is she?

1424
01:15:52,444 --> 01:15:55,420
(gun cocks)

1425
01:15:55,420 --> 01:15:57,120
Where's my daughter, where is she?

1426
01:16:00,556 --> 01:16:01,415
- Get in the car.
- Where is she?

1427
01:16:01,415 --> 01:16:02,763
- Just get in the car.

1428
01:16:04,615 --> 01:16:06,332
- You son of a bitch,
what have you done to her?

1429
01:16:06,332 --> 01:16:09,087
- I don't know what you're
talking about, man, just.

1430
01:16:09,087 --> 01:16:11,320
- [John] All you gotta to is just tell.

1431
01:16:11,320 --> 01:16:12,767
- [Danny] Relax, man,
because if I tell you.

1432
01:16:12,767 --> 01:16:13,684
- No!

1433
01:16:13,684 --> 01:16:15,761
(gun fires)

1434
01:16:15,761 --> 01:16:16,764
(Lydia screams)

1435
01:16:16,764 --> 01:16:18,204
- Go, go.

1436
01:16:18,204 --> 01:16:19,131
(sirens blaring)

1437
01:16:19,131 --> 01:16:21,464
- Danny, what are you doing?

1438
01:16:29,358 --> 01:16:30,191
- Police!

1439
01:16:34,302 --> 01:16:35,302
Get off him.

1440
01:16:38,687 --> 01:16:42,495
- [Danny] That guy's crazy,
get him away from me.

1441
01:16:42,495 --> 01:16:43,745
- Where is she?

1442
01:16:44,581 --> 01:16:46,217
Where have you taken her?

1443
01:16:46,217 --> 01:16:49,288
- I didn't do nothing, you talk to Danny.

1444
01:16:49,288 --> 01:16:52,258
- You're hurting me.
- Get in there.

1445
01:16:52,258 --> 01:16:54,925
(phone ringing)

1446
01:17:02,837 --> 01:17:05,337
(door closes)

1447
01:17:08,460 --> 01:17:09,293
- Nothing.

1448
01:17:09,293 --> 01:17:11,170
They say they haven't seen
Sarah since the motel.

1449
01:17:11,170 --> 01:17:12,330
- Well, they're lying dammit.

1450
01:17:12,330 --> 01:17:13,240
- Of course they are, John,

1451
01:17:13,240 --> 01:17:14,932
but they're not gonna admit
to anything we can't prove.

1452
01:17:14,932 --> 01:17:16,060
- What about Lydia?

1453
01:17:16,060 --> 01:17:16,893
- Well, she's scared.

1454
01:17:16,893 --> 01:17:18,310
I don't think she's said a word.

1455
01:17:18,310 --> 01:17:19,800
- She should be scared.

1456
01:17:19,800 --> 01:17:21,745
You have to find out where Sarah is.

1457
01:17:21,745 --> 01:17:24,510
- We're making progress
with the girl, Natalie.

1458
01:17:24,510 --> 01:17:26,200
- Let me talk to her.

1459
01:17:26,200 --> 01:17:27,033
- No, I don't think that'd be appropriate.

1460
01:17:27,033 --> 01:17:28,620
- Ben.

1461
01:17:28,620 --> 01:17:30,013
Ben, let her try.

1462
01:17:33,840 --> 01:17:34,673
- Okay.

1463
01:17:38,690 --> 01:17:40,040
- I'll be waiting out here.

1464
01:17:42,051 --> 01:17:44,718
(phone ringing)

1465
01:17:53,900 --> 01:17:55,050
- I'm Martha Patterson.

1466
01:17:58,600 --> 01:18:00,300
My whole family's waiting outside.

1467
01:18:01,790 --> 01:18:02,623
Where is she?

1468
01:18:05,066 --> 01:18:06,450
- I don't know nothing.

1469
01:18:08,329 --> 01:18:12,080
I mean I don't know
where she is, you know.

1470
01:18:12,080 --> 01:18:12,913
- Please.

1471
01:18:16,790 --> 01:18:17,723
She's my sister.

1472
01:18:21,730 --> 01:18:23,263
- I'm sorry I can't help you.

1473
01:18:29,560 --> 01:18:31,063
- You have a sister, don't you?

1474
01:18:32,150 --> 01:18:34,550
- No, I don't have a sister, all right,

1475
01:18:34,550 --> 01:18:35,700
not after what she did.

1476
01:18:37,440 --> 01:18:39,533
- Maybe you didn't leave
her any other choice.

1477
01:18:40,890 --> 01:18:42,040
Maybe she did because she didn't want

1478
01:18:42,040 --> 01:18:43,540
you to get into worse trouble.

1479
01:18:45,695 --> 01:18:48,426
Or maybe she did it because
she loves you so much.

1480
01:18:48,426 --> 01:18:49,493
- She don't love me.

1481
01:18:50,770 --> 01:18:52,223
She hates me, she thinks I'm a loser.

1482
01:18:52,223 --> 01:18:55,593
- That is not true and
you know that's not true.

1483
01:18:57,200 --> 01:18:59,007
She's right, I called the
police for one reason,

1484
01:18:59,007 --> 01:19:01,773
but it is not because I hate you.

1485
01:19:03,890 --> 01:19:06,253
I called the police because I love you.

1486
01:19:07,720 --> 01:19:09,246
I was afraid Dan was gonna take you away

1487
01:19:09,246 --> 01:19:11,333
and I'd never see you again.

1488
01:19:13,210 --> 01:19:15,893
Lydia, you are my family.

1489
01:19:16,930 --> 01:19:19,003
You and Amy are all I've got.

1490
01:19:19,900 --> 01:19:21,400
If you are in any kind of trouble,

1491
01:19:21,400 --> 01:19:23,530
I'll do anything to
help you, you know that,

1492
01:19:23,530 --> 01:19:26,220
but you have got to help yourself first.

1493
01:19:26,220 --> 01:19:27,970
You have got to help the Porters because

1494
01:19:27,970 --> 01:19:29,603
it is the right thing to do.

1495
01:19:32,320 --> 01:19:36,298
In the end, you always do the right thing.

1496
01:19:36,298 --> 01:19:37,724
- I know.

1497
01:19:37,724 --> 01:19:38,557
- Always.

1498
01:19:40,607 --> 01:19:41,440
- I know.

1499
01:19:53,010 --> 01:19:54,460
- Let's get an ambulance out there.

1500
01:19:54,460 --> 01:19:55,500
- [Woman] It's on its way, sir.

1501
01:19:55,500 --> 01:19:57,520
- We will call you if
we find anything at all.

1502
01:19:57,520 --> 01:19:59,370
In the meantime, I'd
like you to wait here.

1503
01:19:59,370 --> 01:20:00,620
- No.

1504
01:20:00,620 --> 01:20:01,690
No more waiting.

1505
01:20:05,148 --> 01:20:07,815
(siren blaring)

1506
01:20:25,763 --> 01:20:27,779
- [Natalie] Sarah!

1507
01:20:27,779 --> 01:20:28,612
Sarah!

1508
01:20:29,976 --> 01:20:31,545
- [Martha] Sarah!

1509
01:20:31,545 --> 01:20:32,878
- [Sandy] Sarah!

1510
01:20:33,730 --> 01:20:34,563
- Sarah!

1511
01:20:36,353 --> 01:20:37,560
- Sarah!
- Sarah!

1512
01:20:37,560 --> 01:20:39,209
- [Sandy] Sarah!

1513
01:20:39,209 --> 01:20:40,042
- Sarah!

1514
01:20:41,086 --> 01:20:42,249
- Sarah!

1515
01:20:42,249 --> 01:20:43,620
- [Martha] Sarah!

1516
01:20:43,620 --> 01:20:44,825
- [Sandy] Sarah.

1517
01:20:44,825 --> 01:20:45,908
- Oh, my God.

1518
01:20:48,331 --> 01:20:49,707
Stay here.

1519
01:20:49,707 --> 01:20:51,339
- No, Mom.
- Stay there.

1520
01:20:51,339 --> 01:20:52,172
- No.

1521
01:20:53,259 --> 01:20:54,092
- Sarah.

1522
01:20:56,191 --> 01:20:57,024
Sarah.

1523
01:20:58,050 --> 01:20:59,229
- [Sandy] Is she okay?

1524
01:20:59,229 --> 01:21:00,599
- I'm here.

1525
01:21:00,599 --> 01:21:01,751
- [Man] We got her.

1526
01:21:01,751 --> 01:21:04,418
Get our doctors out here, hurry!

1527
01:21:05,606 --> 01:21:08,328
- [Man 2] Don't try to move her.

1528
01:21:08,328 --> 01:21:11,995
- [Man] Let me through
here, let me through.

1529
01:21:14,738 --> 01:21:17,988
Sir, excuse us, please, let us through.

1530
01:21:21,991 --> 01:21:23,084
Sir, we have to get in there.

1531
01:21:23,084 --> 01:21:24,667
- [John] Thank God.

1532
01:21:25,860 --> 01:21:27,631
- She's in pretty bad shape,

1533
01:21:27,631 --> 01:21:28,960
but she's gonna make it.

1534
01:21:28,960 --> 01:21:31,340
She's suffering multiple
fractures of the head

1535
01:21:31,340 --> 01:21:33,490
and face, a few broken ribs

1536
01:21:33,490 --> 01:21:35,066
and some internal bleeding.

1537
01:21:35,066 --> 01:21:36,170
- I wanna be with her.

1538
01:21:36,170 --> 01:21:37,920
- She's barely conscious.

1539
01:21:37,920 --> 01:21:39,630
She may not know you're there.

1540
01:21:39,630 --> 01:21:41,210
- She'd know.

1541
01:21:41,210 --> 01:21:43,386
- Give us a few more minutes.

1542
01:21:43,386 --> 01:21:45,969
(gentle music)

1543
01:21:47,690 --> 01:21:49,270
- John, I'm sorry.

1544
01:21:49,270 --> 01:21:50,970
I am so sorry that I didn't believe you

1545
01:21:50,970 --> 01:21:51,831
when you said she was missing.

1546
01:21:51,831 --> 01:21:53,133
- Ben, there's no need for that.

1547
01:21:53,133 --> 01:21:54,830
No one's blaming anybody.

1548
01:21:54,830 --> 01:21:56,233
- I am, I'm blaming myself.

1549
01:21:57,110 --> 01:21:58,760
You guys are amazing, you did it.

1550
01:21:59,750 --> 01:22:02,959
You stuck together and all
by yourselves you did it.

1551
01:22:02,959 --> 01:22:05,542
(gentle music)

1552
01:22:14,090 --> 01:22:15,982
- She's under pretty deep.

1553
01:22:15,982 --> 01:22:17,332
I wouldn't expect too much.

1554
01:22:21,785 --> 01:22:23,425
- Sarah?

1555
01:22:23,425 --> 01:22:24,258
Honey.

1556
01:22:25,994 --> 01:22:26,827
- Sarah.

1557
01:22:27,925 --> 01:22:28,758
Sarah.

1558
01:22:29,599 --> 01:22:31,327
It's Martha.

1559
01:22:31,327 --> 01:22:32,160
I'm here.

1560
01:22:34,261 --> 01:22:35,511
We're all here.

1561
01:22:37,706 --> 01:22:40,539
- You're safe now, you're with us.

1562
01:22:44,437 --> 01:22:46,937
- [Natalie] John, talk to her.

1563
01:22:50,247 --> 01:22:51,080
- Sarah.

1564
01:22:53,660 --> 01:22:54,493
Sarah.

1565
01:22:57,234 --> 01:22:58,067
It's Dad.

1566
01:23:01,750 --> 01:23:02,850
Don't leave us, honey.

1567
01:23:05,300 --> 01:23:06,260
Don't go away.

1568
01:23:10,194 --> 01:23:11,194
We need you.

1569
01:23:15,282 --> 01:23:16,199
I need you.

1570
01:23:21,917 --> 01:23:23,417
I love you, Sarah.

1571
01:23:24,861 --> 01:23:25,861
- Mom, look.

1572
01:23:28,721 --> 01:23:29,554
Dad.

1573
01:23:38,950 --> 01:23:41,286
- [Martha] Sarah, wake up sweetie.

1574
01:23:41,286 --> 01:23:44,203
- [Sandy] She's gonna be all right.

1575
01:23:46,865 --> 01:23:48,198
- Come on, baby.

1576
01:23:50,625 --> 01:23:52,059
- Sarah.

1577
01:23:52,059 --> 01:23:54,642
(gentle music)

1578
01:25:45,499 --> 01:25:48,666
(gentle techno music)
