1
00:01:52,431 --> 00:01:53,363
If you were a man

2
00:01:54,433 --> 00:01:56,401
I'm Dick Nolan and invention
things for a living

3
00:01:56,602 --> 00:01:57,364
I'm a reporter

4
00:02:11,984 --> 00:02:14,612
It is the strangest story
you have covered

5
00:02:15,187 --> 00:02:18,350
He started the day that Margaret Ulbrich
she left her husband quencher

6
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:20,956
And it seemed the best thing to do

7
00:02:22,795 --> 00:02:23,727
Let Jane

8
00:04:09,668 --> 00:04:10,362
honey

9
00:04:11,236 --> 00:04:12,203
You did it!

10
00:04:13,071 --> 00:04:14,060
Are you here!

11
00:04:14,573 --> 00:04:15,835
Look at you now

12
00:04:16,074 --> 00:04:16,802
DeeAnn

13
00:04:17,276 --> 00:04:18,402
DeeAnn
-- I know

14
00:04:18,610 --> 00:04:21,579
But I had to adapt and not use
a name that my mother would call me

15
00:04:21,847 --> 00:04:23,371
So you're excited
for all this?

16
00:04:23,649 --> 00:04:24,980
You've established?
How about this Jane?

17
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:27,514
Jane is fine, is going
a little sweet school

18
00:04:27,786 --> 00:04:29,913
You know, it's really difficult without
his father and all that

19
00:04:30,656 --> 00:04:32,055
Do not know if we can ,,,
-- Come

20
00:04:32,591 --> 00:04:33,489
These better so

21
00:04:34,092 --> 00:04:35,719
Between us never fall me
While Frank

22
00:04:35,994 --> 00:04:39,054
You were a bridesmaid
-- Exactly, so I could not say anything

23
00:04:39,298 --> 00:04:42,392
But if I see him around again
I'll tell

24
00:04:42,668 --> 00:04:43,999
Now come on, you have to have fun

25
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:46,169
To go to Hungry Eye Jazz

26
00:04:46,405 --> 00:04:47,667
For Italian food
Vanezi

27
00:04:47,906 --> 00:04:49,806
For salvation try
Buddhist temple

28
00:04:50,008 --> 00:04:51,134
For art gallery Sixth

29
00:04:52,444 --> 00:04:53,570
Only show modern art?

30
00:04:53,779 --> 00:04:54,837
All show only
modern art

31
00:04:55,047 --> 00:04:56,309
And in the basement are expressly

32
00:04:56,448 --> 00:04:58,143
I express that is?
I have no idea

33
00:04:58,584 --> 00:04:59,744
You have much to learn

34
00:05:11,597 --> 00:05:13,428
Back then women
they did not leave

35
00:05:13,966 --> 00:05:15,399
Not without a job or prospects

36
00:05:16,234 --> 00:05:18,498
All she had was her
paintings in the trunk

37
00:05:18,737 --> 00:05:19,897
And his daughter in the backseat

38
00:05:20,939 --> 00:05:22,099
good luck

39
00:05:34,019 --> 00:05:35,281
We receive many ladies here

40
00:05:36,488 --> 00:05:38,115
Then your husband approves you work?

41
00:05:39,958 --> 00:05:41,050
My husband and I are separated

42
00:05:43,095 --> 00:05:44,027
Separated?

43
00:05:47,799 --> 00:05:50,563
I realize that I have not
work experience

44
00:05:52,104 --> 00:05:53,196
but really

45
00:05:53,672 --> 00:05:55,606
I need this job have a
daughter support

46
00:05:57,676 --> 00:06:00,270
I'm not very good convincing but
if I like painting

47
00:06:00,512 --> 00:06:01,308
If I could

48
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:02,740
Show my portfolio

49
00:06:04,116 --> 00:06:05,310

The Art Institute Watkins
Nashville

51
00:06:08,186 --> 00:06:09,278
I did some illustrations

00:06:12,024 --> 00:06:13,423

And ,,,

55
00:06:16,094 --> 00:06:19,120
This is a portrait coal

56
00:06:20,465 --> 00:06:22,524
If you understand that this is a
furniture company?

57
00:07:05,744 --> 00:07:07,541
They are very nice
-- Yes

58
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:09,542

Thank You

00:07:25,864 --> 00:07:26,728
And how old are you?

68
00:07:26,998 --> 00:07:27,896
I am 9 years

00:07:28,633 --> 00:07:29,657
9 years, and ,,,

00:07:42,147 --> 00:07:44,672
Even if it could be
respectfully disagree

71
00:07:44,916 --> 00:07:47,146
I like this piece
traditional

72
00:07:48,653 --> 00:07:49,483
Reach out more

73
00:07:49,988 --> 00:07:50,920
Come on, good!

74

They want to touch it?

75
00:07:59,264 --> 00:08:00,094
Let

76
00:08:00,365 --> 00:08:01,389
Come on, do it!

77
00:08:02,033 --> 00:08:04,433
Do not worry do not break

78
00:08:06,905 --> 00:08:08,031
Worth $ 35

79
00:08:10,675 --> 00:08:11,733
Excuse me a second?

80
00:08:19,951 --> 00:08:21,077
Here
-- Thank You

81
00:08:21,987 --> 00:08:22,715
Thank You

82
00:08:26,992 --> 00:08:28,619
Worth more than the change

83
00:08:29,127 --> 00:08:30,651
You should sell
so cheap

84
00:08:31,129 --> 00:08:32,426
Well I'm just glad
he liked

85
00:08:34,366 --> 00:08:35,390
You passed that point

86
00:08:36,168 --> 00:08:37,658
Your heart is in your work

87
00:08:40,572 --> 00:08:41,300
What's your name?

88
00:08:43,842 --> 00:08:44,638
Margaret

89
00:08:46,645 --> 00:08:49,273
But not you rather flirt
those girls over there?

90
00:08:49,815 --> 00:08:51,612
No, I likes you Margaret

91
00:08:53,051 --> 00:08:53,915
Ulbrich

92
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:56,915
You know Margaret Ulbrich?

93
00:08:57,189 --> 00:08:59,089
You're underestimating

94
00:09:00,358 --> 00:09:01,382
Let me show you how it's done

95
00:09:03,795 --> 00:09:05,228
little girl

96
00:09:05,964 --> 00:09:10,901
You would have them do your portrait the
world famous Margaret Ulbrich

97
00:09:11,136 --> 00:09:12,660
Queen of the Bay

98
00:09:12,871 --> 00:09:15,431
In mere minutes capture your soul

99
00:09:16,341 --> 00:09:17,740
Do Not

100
00:09:18,443 --> 00:09:20,502
Dont you wish you were your
in this beautiful painting?

101
00:09:21,012 --> 00:09:21,979
That's me

102
00:09:22,247 --> 00:09:23,214
And that's me

103
00:09:24,049 --> 00:09:27,212
And that I was until my mom
He became a Chinese boy

104
00:09:29,254 --> 00:09:30,221
my apologies

105
00:09:30,455 --> 00:09:32,389
I did not understand the situation

106
00:09:33,225 --> 00:09:37,662
Well I better go before Mr, Ulbrich
come and hit me in the eye

107
00:09:41,333 --> 00:09:43,426
Mr, Ulbrich is no longer in the image

108
00:09:51,409 --> 00:09:52,706
Good night, Henry

109
00:09:54,012 --> 00:09:55,639
Sorry for not calling to book

110
00:09:55,881 --> 00:09:58,247
Lucky I have a table list,
madame

111
00:09:58,483 --> 00:10:00,383
Good evening, welcome

112
00:10:00,652 --> 00:10:01,846
Plz follow me

113
00:10:03,188 --> 00:10:06,885
And do I have to pay a dime because
I gave the chef a painting

114
00:10:07,092 --> 00:10:08,320
You know what he said?
-- What?

115
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:12,621
He said nobody paints my country
as the great Walter Keane

116
00:10:15,867 --> 00:10:17,994
I can not believe you
lived in Paris

117
00:10:20,739 --> 00:10:22,502
The best time of my life

118
00:10:25,277 --> 00:10:26,608
I've never been on a plane

119
00:10:27,979 --> 00:10:29,708
You have to experiment
these things

120
00:10:29,981 --> 00:10:31,141
You have to catch them

121
00:10:31,850 --> 00:10:33,010
I wanted to be an artist so

122
00:10:33,218 --> 00:10:33,946
I went alone

123
00:10:34,519 --> 00:10:36,111
I studied painting there

124
00:10:36,988 --> 00:10:38,615
I lived in a studio

125
00:10:38,890 --> 00:10:40,653
I survived on bread and wine

126
00:10:41,192 --> 00:10:42,352
You're a romantic

127
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:43,754
Yes, I am!

128
00:10:45,563 --> 00:10:48,589
Of course go there
was not easy

129
00:10:49,668 --> 00:10:50,635
I had to quit my job

130
00:10:52,737 --> 00:10:54,034
Leaving my wife

131
00:10:56,508 --> 00:10:57,202
Yes

132
00:10:57,475 --> 00:10:58,464
these decisions
are not easy

133
00:11:01,112 --> 00:11:02,374
I have never acted
freely

134
00:11:03,448 --> 00:11:05,973
I was a child and then
a wife and then a mother

135
00:11:08,653 --> 00:11:11,213
All my paintings are Jane
because she's all I know

136
00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:13,184
Do not belittle your work

137
00:11:13,892 --> 00:11:15,052
Have an amazing talent

138
00:11:16,494 --> 00:11:19,588
You can see someone and capture
on your canvas

139
00:11:19,864 --> 00:11:21,354
You can paint people

140
00:11:22,667 --> 00:11:23,827
I can only paint things

141
00:11:24,569 --> 00:11:26,628
I mean, my streets are ,,,

142
00:11:27,439 --> 00:11:28,406
lovely

143
00:11:29,274 --> 00:11:30,332
But at the end of the day

144
00:11:30,542 --> 00:11:32,567
They are just a collection of buildings
and sidewalks

145
00:11:34,479 --> 00:11:37,107
Walter, I bet you can
paint whatever

146
00:11:40,919 --> 00:11:42,113
When you look at me so

147
00:11:42,354 --> 00:11:43,912
You could fall in love strongly

148
00:11:51,229 --> 00:11:52,059
Sorry

149
00:11:53,398 --> 00:11:54,695
This goes really fast

150
00:11:58,103 --> 00:11:59,297
I have not been on a date
in a while

151
00:12:11,950 --> 00:12:14,043
Jane, honey, stop moving

152
00:12:14,319 --> 00:12:17,652
Mother after all this time must
know how my face looks

153
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:23,721
Hey, your canvas is blank

154
00:12:24,596 --> 00:12:26,086
You can not rush inspiration

155
00:12:27,465 --> 00:12:30,400
Do not bother Mr, Keane creativity
comes from within

156
00:12:30,969 --> 00:12:31,799
Do not worry

157
00:12:32,103 --> 00:12:33,127
She does not bother me

158
00:12:44,549 --> 00:12:45,641
I can ask you a question?

159
00:12:46,885 --> 00:12:48,750
What about the large
and crazy eyes?

160
00:12:49,788 --> 00:12:50,516
Oh

161
00:12:51,156 --> 00:12:53,317
Well, I think you can see things

162
00:12:54,059 --> 00:12:54,957
Eye

163
00:12:55,894 --> 00:12:57,555
The eyes are the window
soul

164
00:12:58,763 --> 00:12:59,661
Yes but

165
00:12:59,931 --> 00:13:03,492
The pints in a way very
out of proportion

166
00:13:04,569 --> 00:13:05,331
Okay

167
00:13:05,603 --> 00:13:07,730
The eyes are like Express
my emotions

168
00:13:09,007 --> 00:13:10,133
I have always painted well

169
00:13:11,476 --> 00:13:14,343
When I was little I had surgery
I leave me deaf for a while and

170
00:13:14,612 --> 00:13:15,579
I could not hear so

171
00:13:16,414 --> 00:13:17,540
I stared

172
00:13:18,383 --> 00:13:20,442
Trust the eyes of people

173
00:13:21,686 --> 00:13:22,778
Walter?

174
00:13:23,288 --> 00:13:24,812
Hey, Walt, I thought it was you!

175
00:13:26,057 --> 00:13:27,285
I'm glad to see you

176
00:13:33,098 --> 00:13:34,497
Hear about permissions
for Thursday

177
00:13:34,699 --> 00:13:35,631
Yes? excellent

178
00:13:36,167 --> 00:13:37,031
I'll architects

179
00:13:37,302 --> 00:13:38,166
Ok

180
00:13:43,241 --> 00:13:44,037
What was that?

181
00:13:50,849 --> 00:13:52,316
I did not want you to know

182
00:13:54,252 --> 00:13:56,117
I am in commercial property

183
00:13:58,156 --> 00:13:59,145
You're a real estate agent?

184
00:13:59,858 --> 00:14:00,654
Yes

185
00:14:02,393 --> 00:14:07,296
I am a successful agent, the top of the
office, 3 years on the job

186
00:14:08,466 --> 00:14:09,490
And you ashamed?

187
00:14:12,003 --> 00:14:13,903
Any fool can fix
a sublet

188
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:19,571
Everything I've ever wanted is
keep me as an artist

189
00:14:21,045 --> 00:14:22,979
I tried to start from scratch

190
00:14:23,815 --> 00:14:24,713
But I did not succeed

191
00:14:27,318 --> 00:14:28,945
I'm just a Sunday painter

192
00:14:42,667 --> 00:14:43,656
Thank You

193
00:14:43,868 --> 00:14:44,835
Sign in here

194
00:14:47,972 --> 00:14:49,132
Put it here

195
00:14:50,175 --> 00:14:51,904
Here?
-- If there is great

196
00:14:52,377 --> 00:14:54,470
I would like that is not
in the way

197
00:14:56,214 --> 00:14:57,579
namely

198
00:14:58,016 --> 00:14:59,779
In something I'm working

199
00:15:01,019 --> 00:15:02,316
You can see

200
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,449
I'm working ,,,

201
00:15:28,846 --> 00:15:29,574
hello

202
00:15:49,601 --> 00:15:50,465
What happens?

203
00:15:53,238 --> 00:15:54,603
Frank wants to take Jane

204
00:15:55,907 --> 00:15:57,238
He says I'm not a proper mother

205
00:15:57,508 --> 00:15:58,805
And ,,,
-- You're perfect

206
00:16:01,679 --> 00:16:02,646
He told the court that

207
00:16:04,182 --> 00:16:05,581
She lacks a suitable house

208
00:16:06,050 --> 00:16:08,848
And that is beyond my
capabilities

209
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,178
As a single mother

210
00:16:10,688 --> 00:16:11,746
Will you marry me?

211
00:16:19,897 --> 00:16:21,364
Do not think of a reason
to say no

212
00:16:21,666 --> 00:16:23,964
Because I have a million reasons
to say that if

213
00:16:25,803 --> 00:16:26,997
I know it makes no sense

214
00:16:28,873 --> 00:16:30,807
But think how much
enjoy ourselves

215
00:16:31,776 --> 00:16:33,971
And I will cherish, girls

216
00:16:39,217 --> 00:16:40,184
Margaret

217
00:16:40,385 --> 00:16:41,079
I'm on one knee

218
00:16:41,552 --> 00:16:42,644
Come on, you say?

219
00:16:42,854 --> 00:16:43,843
Let's get married

220
00:16:44,289 --> 00:16:46,189
We could be in Hawaii
the weekend

221
00:16:46,424 --> 00:16:48,289
Oh, Hawaii, marriage

222
00:16:50,295 --> 00:16:53,321
I do not know Walter I'm crazy about you
but I am very overwhelmed

223
00:16:53,531 --> 00:16:55,260
Why we would go to Hawaii?

224
00:16:55,466 --> 00:16:57,024
Because you're a princess

225
00:16:57,302 --> 00:16:59,361
And you deserve to get married in paradise

226
00:17:20,692 --> 00:17:21,590
You were right

227
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:22,992
It's paradise

228
00:17:24,228 --> 00:17:26,128
Only God could create these colors

229
00:17:26,164 --> 00:17:27,927
I told you!

230
00:17:29,934 --> 00:17:31,265
We can not stay here
forever?

231
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:34,199
I do not know if forever

232
00:17:35,273 --> 00:17:37,138
But I guess I could
Fix a week

233
00:18:16,647 --> 00:18:19,172
There was a waterfall and the air was
so fresh you could taste

234
00:18:20,184 --> 00:18:22,243
And this was an ancient altar

235
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:26,616
That is a statue of Kane
the god of creation

236
00:18:27,158 --> 00:18:28,557
I prayed

237
00:18:30,128 --> 00:18:32,756
Those are Walter and Jane built
the sandcastle together

238
00:18:34,532 --> 00:18:36,227
Well, this happens
very fast

239
00:18:36,868 --> 00:18:39,735
In the time you moved here
I have been on 2 appointments and you and you married

240
00:18:40,538 --> 00:18:43,666
Well I guess there was a gap in
Walter filled my life

241
00:18:44,142 --> 00:18:45,302
Walter has filled many things

242
00:18:45,777 --> 00:18:47,972
It's got all the skirts
art

243
00:18:48,179 --> 00:18:49,339
You're talking about my husband

244
00:18:49,814 --> 00:18:50,940
I know, why I mentioned

245
00:18:53,384 --> 00:18:54,442
I'm not naive

246
00:18:57,422 --> 00:18:58,286
I am naive but

247
00:18:58,489 --> 00:18:59,251
I know who I married

248
00:19:00,158 --> 00:19:02,058
Walter can be impulsive but
It is a good provider

249
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:03,818
Yes wonderful with Jane

250
00:19:04,929 --> 00:19:07,762
I'm just looking to start from scratch,
I am a divorcee with a girl

251
00:19:09,033 --> 00:19:09,965
Walter is a blessing

252
00:19:13,438 --> 00:19:14,336
Thank You

253
00:19:28,252 --> 00:19:30,948
These on the threshold of incredible success

254
00:19:33,090 --> 00:19:35,581
The theme of the composition is
spontaneity

255
00:19:35,793 --> 00:19:37,420
The image has no center
visual attention

256
00:19:37,929 --> 00:19:39,988
It is very gestural
-- Definitely

257
00:19:40,264 --> 00:19:41,731
Heavily influenced by Tashes

258
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,491
Listen to a famous was
here looking

259
00:19:46,103 --> 00:19:47,331
Well, I'm not allowed to say

260
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,047
Christ

261
00:19:57,515 --> 00:19:59,415
Do not go here right now
please

262
00:19:59,917 --> 00:20:00,884
Ruben

263
00:20:01,052 --> 00:20:01,916
good Morning

264
00:20:02,787 --> 00:20:03,685
You have a moment?

265
00:20:03,888 --> 00:20:05,981
Walter, you're missing the word, quote

266
00:20:06,991 --> 00:20:07,923
I can come back later

267
00:20:09,393 --> 00:20:11,657
You'll love my stuff today

268
00:20:16,067 --> 00:20:17,295
I have not seen that before?

269
00:20:19,804 --> 00:20:22,432
No that was painted at 5

270
00:20:22,707 --> 00:20:25,039
This is the 6th Street

271
00:20:25,443 --> 00:20:27,240
I do not understand, you lived in Paris
for a week

272
00:20:27,445 --> 00:20:28,844
As you can continue taking
paintings?

273
00:20:29,146 --> 00:20:30,238
Everything is here

274
00:20:30,448 --> 00:20:31,380
And here

275
00:20:32,450 --> 00:20:33,474
Well it will not go up here

276
00:20:34,018 --> 00:20:36,714
Walter know you do not go
these representations

277
00:20:36,921 --> 00:20:37,683
You are very literal

278
00:20:38,489 --> 00:20:40,013
Art is a fashion
-- If it is

279
00:20:40,925 --> 00:20:42,552
People want Kandinsky
or Rafko

280
00:20:42,827 --> 00:20:44,055
They do not want

281
00:20:44,529 --> 00:20:45,553
Street scenes

282
00:20:49,166 --> 00:20:50,155
How about this?

283
00:21:01,612 --> 00:21:03,443
My God you've come
to a new period

284
00:21:05,383 --> 00:21:06,247
Do Not

285
00:21:06,717 --> 00:21:07,706
They are from my wife

286
00:21:11,622 --> 00:21:12,714
Why your eyes are so big?

287
00:21:14,025 --> 00:21:15,356
As large gumdrops
and quiet

288
00:21:16,027 --> 00:21:17,119
It's expressionism

289
00:21:17,628 --> 00:21:19,118
Surely you recognize

290
00:21:21,566 --> 00:21:23,466
Well, I'm glad that
have been found

291
00:21:25,169 --> 00:21:26,067
Then you say

292
00:21:27,004 --> 00:21:28,301
I say no, it is not art

293
00:21:28,839 --> 00:21:29,669
It is not art?

294
00:21:29,874 --> 00:21:32,502
I paint for a magazine,
you know the turtle draws

295
00:21:32,710 --> 00:21:33,574
Win a contest

296
00:21:33,778 --> 00:21:35,439
How dare you? A lot
People you may like

297
00:21:35,713 --> 00:21:37,908
If someone but not
enters through

298
00:21:38,316 --> 00:21:41,183
Now please clean this before
good taste police come

299
00:22:02,239 --> 00:22:04,764
It is a secret society of owners
galleries and critics

300
00:22:05,042 --> 00:22:07,510
We will meet on Sunday
to eat something

301
00:22:07,712 --> 00:22:08,974
And recite what is great

302
00:22:09,714 --> 00:22:11,113
As at hearings
McCarthy

303
00:22:12,249 --> 00:22:14,911
I point to this painter
I exiling that painter

304
00:22:15,186 --> 00:22:16,653
There is no man's land

305
00:22:17,922 --> 00:22:20,755
I think people buy
art that touches

306
00:22:21,626 --> 00:22:23,651
If you live in a fairy tale

307
00:22:24,595 --> 00:22:26,995
People unable to discover anything

308
00:22:27,531 --> 00:22:30,022
Buy art because it is in the
time and place indicated

309
00:22:33,838 --> 00:22:36,033
Ok, a welcome to Cal Jader

310
00:22:40,444 --> 00:22:43,277
Well, sure to stay
for the show's 1:00 a,m,

311
00:22:51,188 --> 00:22:52,314
Enjoy, enjoy

312
00:22:54,225 --> 00:22:55,089
apology

313
00:22:55,826 --> 00:22:58,556
Hey I love Banducci
music tonight

314
00:22:58,796 --> 00:23:00,388
this brilliant
-- Thank you, thank

315
00:23:00,765 --> 00:23:01,993
Walter Keane

316
00:23:02,233 --> 00:23:03,165
I am a painter

317
00:23:04,702 --> 00:23:05,794
I was watching your walls

318
00:23:06,604 --> 00:23:07,798
They are very empty

319
00:23:09,306 --> 00:23:10,204
Maybe you're right

320
00:23:10,474 --> 00:23:11,702
What color would seem like good?

321
00:23:12,276 --> 00:23:13,265
No, no

322
00:23:13,477 --> 00:23:16,310
I am an artist, used to live in Paris

323
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:18,275
Now I have moved to
USA

324
00:23:18,582 --> 00:23:21,107
And I look ,,,

325
00:23:22,153 --> 00:23:23,484
An exhibition debut

326
00:23:24,055 --> 00:23:25,249
I like my club as is

327
00:23:25,756 --> 00:23:28,657
If your stuff is so good
sees it in a museum

328
00:23:30,194 --> 00:23:31,855
I respect that you are a
businessman

329
00:23:32,396 --> 00:23:33,385
Not a charity

330
00:23:34,198 --> 00:23:35,165
such

331
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:37,731
If I rent your walls?

332
00:24:01,025 --> 00:24:01,855
Walter, Margaret?

333
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:02,989
Ready?

334
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:17,768
An art lover

335
00:24:17,975 --> 00:24:19,806
Beautiful, that I can do
for you sir?

336
00:24:20,644 --> 00:24:21,668
Just looking for the bathroom

337
00:24:24,048 --> 00:24:24,912
Thank You

338
00:25:01,485 --> 00:25:02,679
Look at that girl

339
00:25:04,421 --> 00:25:05,888
This sad

340
00:25:07,224 --> 00:25:08,020
It is poor?

341
00:25:08,993 --> 00:25:10,017
It has been forgotten

342
00:25:11,095 --> 00:25:12,824
Makes me want to mourn

343
00:25:16,567 --> 00:25:17,556
You're Keane?

344
00:25:18,402 --> 00:25:19,596
Yes, I am

345
00:25:20,070 --> 00:25:21,628
You're a great painter

346
00:25:22,873 --> 00:25:24,898
Thank you, thank you very much

347
00:25:26,410 --> 00:25:27,707
Your work is very powerful

348
00:25:29,146 --> 00:25:31,580
There are so many emotions
in those eyes

349
00:25:35,052 --> 00:25:35,950
Is something wrong?

350
00:25:37,221 --> 00:25:38,153
Do Not

351
00:25:38,355 --> 00:25:41,051
I did not realize you were talking
the picture of my wife

352
00:25:41,258 --> 00:25:42,190
Oh I get it

353
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:45,823
The artist does not want to get rid
your favorite piece

354
00:25:46,664 --> 00:25:47,756
Oh honey, thanks

355
00:25:48,032 --> 00:25:49,192
I love him

356
00:25:52,269 --> 00:25:53,133
I had not delayed

357
00:26:06,250 --> 00:26:07,717
Hey Picasso

358
00:26:08,219 --> 00:26:09,379
Good place no?

359
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:12,220
Thanks for that closet
where I put brooms

360
00:26:12,790 --> 00:26:15,054
Are you talking about? It's just

361
00:26:15,326 --> 00:26:17,089
When people drink have
to relieve themselves

362
00:26:17,628 --> 00:26:18,560
It is insulting

363
00:26:18,762 --> 00:26:20,320
When people see art not
should think about defecating

364
00:26:20,865 --> 00:26:22,833
Hey, careful what you say

365
00:26:23,033 --> 00:26:24,261
Hey, there are ladies present

366
00:26:40,484 --> 00:26:42,315
Never hit a deposit
before

367
00:26:42,586 --> 00:26:45,714
Sorry, laughed Banducci
our art so I fell

368
00:26:46,023 --> 00:26:48,890
Since when are you like? the artists
should handle criticism

369
00:26:49,193 --> 00:26:50,023
you are right

370
00:26:50,561 --> 00:26:52,085
He was already in a bad place

371
00:26:52,596 --> 00:26:56,157
He had taken a couple of drinks and
someone thought I painted your big eyes

372
00:26:56,901 --> 00:26:57,765
What?

373
00:26:58,669 --> 00:27:00,466
I do not understand because
would you do that?

374
00:27:01,171 --> 00:27:02,229
It was a misunderstanding

375
00:27:02,873 --> 00:27:04,738
And then I did not want to compromise
sale

376
00:27:07,611 --> 00:27:08,600
Well do not do it again

377
00:27:18,689 --> 00:27:20,316
Hey
-- Me you do not have a bad time

378
00:27:20,524 --> 00:27:21,582
I only came for my stuff

379
00:27:27,197 --> 00:27:29,097
Can you believe it?
We are exhausted

380
00:27:29,366 --> 00:27:30,663
I even have a chef

381
00:27:30,868 --> 00:27:31,800
It is a Monday!

382
00:27:32,903 --> 00:27:33,767
Walter

383
00:27:33,971 --> 00:27:35,495
We arrived to home page

384
00:27:36,373 --> 00:27:39,103
People are here because
want to see the paintings

385
00:27:39,310 --> 00:27:40,675
Vera adult men fighting

386
00:27:43,681 --> 00:27:44,909
I'm sick of you Keane

387
00:27:45,149 --> 00:27:46,616
I'll see you in court

388
00:27:46,817 --> 00:27:47,977
Son of a bitch!

389
00:27:48,252 --> 00:27:50,618
I'm going to sue
-- I'm tired of you

390
00:27:50,854 --> 00:27:51,843
And your paintings

391
00:27:52,523 --> 00:27:56,425
I'm going to sue for insulting
and offend my great paintings!

392
00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:10,864
Walter Keane was not a
subtle man

393
00:28:11,976 --> 00:28:13,841
But the subtle does not sell

394
00:28:16,580 --> 00:28:17,638
Yes sir

395
00:28:17,848 --> 00:28:20,646
It was a good circus what they did

396
00:28:22,019 --> 00:28:23,577
Dick Nolan, examiner

397
00:28:25,022 --> 00:28:26,887
Hey friend, not you
remove the dream

398
00:28:27,524 --> 00:28:30,084
I take these things with a spoon
gives me something to write

399
00:28:30,694 --> 00:28:31,592
In my column

400
00:28:31,795 --> 00:28:33,922
I thought you wrote only
celebrities

401
00:28:34,832 --> 00:28:36,857
Banducci is famous
and you hit

402
00:28:37,368 --> 00:28:38,699
So you're a celebrity
now

403
00:28:40,337 --> 00:28:41,235
Buy me a drink

404
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:44,168
Hey Gary

405
00:28:52,916 --> 00:28:54,315
Then, Walter

406
00:28:55,486 --> 00:28:56,453
Tell me about your work

407
00:28:58,522 --> 00:28:59,819
When I was in paris

408
00:29:00,357 --> 00:29:01,346
No, that does not

409
00:29:03,694 --> 00:29:04,888
I refer to the homeless kids

410
00:29:22,513 --> 00:29:26,347
awake

411
00:29:28,419 --> 00:29:29,681
You were a success

412
00:29:31,688 --> 00:29:32,552
That night!

413
00:29:33,290 --> 00:29:35,053
I sold all your big eyes

414
00:29:37,361 --> 00:29:38,919
They love you

415
00:29:47,871 --> 00:29:48,997
Need more paintings!

416
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:50,829
Walter!
-- Now!

417
00:29:57,481 --> 00:29:59,210
Quiet, this is an opportunity

418
00:30:00,684 --> 00:30:02,948
We must seize
as a team

419
00:30:03,587 --> 00:30:04,884
Go to clubs

420
00:30:05,155 --> 00:30:06,986
You do what you love

421
00:30:19,069 --> 00:30:20,331
Get out

422
00:30:28,378 --> 00:30:29,208
I love you

423
00:31:35,379 --> 00:31:36,778
They know a poet once said

424
00:31:37,247 --> 00:31:40,114
The eyes are the windows to the soul

425
00:31:40,951 --> 00:31:43,385
That's why I paint so great,
I've always done well

426
00:31:43,654 --> 00:31:47,317
If you are interested in that style
I'm working on pieces

427
00:31:48,225 --> 00:31:49,783
I have a blond kid

428
00:31:50,060 --> 00:31:51,459
In a yellow dress

429
00:31:51,728 --> 00:31:52,695
They break your heart

430
00:31:53,897 --> 00:31:54,829
Walter

431
00:31:55,832 --> 00:31:56,958
Honey, why are you here?

432
00:31:59,736 --> 00:32:00,668
why lie

433
00:32:03,073 --> 00:32:03,937
Excuse

434
00:32:06,176 --> 00:32:08,144
Wouldst credit for something
that is not yours

435
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:10,977
Just trying to close a deal

436
00:32:11,448 --> 00:32:13,109
These kids are part of my being

437
00:32:13,650 --> 00:32:16,710
I am a seller in addition to them
they could not meet the painter

438
00:32:17,387 --> 00:32:19,514
I can not know because
You told me to stay at home

439
00:32:20,224 --> 00:32:23,250
We're making money, your pocket
or mine, what is the difference?

440
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:25,284
You take so lightly

441
00:32:25,495 --> 00:32:26,325
Not at all

442
00:32:26,597 --> 00:32:30,397
It is no credit, you mean your
you painted? Well I do not care

443
00:32:30,667 --> 00:32:31,964
For me di a monkey painted them

444
00:32:32,803 --> 00:32:36,466
Well I'm glad you can talk
but without an emotional connection

445
00:32:38,375 --> 00:32:40,866
I just want to share
with the world

446
00:32:42,312 --> 00:32:46,043
Wish that they are gathering dust
or hanging in someone's living room?

447
00:32:54,992 --> 00:32:55,788
Who is this man?

448
00:32:56,059 --> 00:32:57,583
That's Dino Olivetti

449
00:32:57,794 --> 00:33:00,024
He's a genius with disks
but not what you think

450
00:33:00,597 --> 00:33:01,859
He does not speak any English

451
00:33:02,099 --> 00:33:02,861
Hey

452
00:33:05,235 --> 00:33:06,497
Good to see you

453
00:33:30,327 --> 00:33:32,795
Mr, Olivetti is delighted
with paint

454
00:33:33,297 --> 00:33:35,265
Want to know who
is the artist

455
00:33:53,417 --> 00:33:54,406
I am what

456
00:34:27,818 --> 00:34:29,012
$ 5,000

457
00:34:30,087 --> 00:34:33,056
We won $ 5,000

458
00:34:33,357 --> 00:34:35,052
And it was not even one
of good

459
00:34:36,293 --> 00:34:37,555
Do you mean one of the YOURS?

460
00:34:37,861 --> 00:34:39,123
No, no, no

461
00:34:40,263 --> 00:34:42,026
Well, our, one of our

462
00:34:42,999 --> 00:34:46,901
We are now hanging in the collection
Italian industrialist Dino Olivetti

463
00:34:47,337 --> 00:34:49,396
With your support comes credibility

464
00:34:49,673 --> 00:34:50,867
And with credibility

465
00:34:51,108 --> 00:34:52,234
Comes respect

466
00:34:52,843 --> 00:34:54,037
What about honesty?

467
00:34:54,845 --> 00:34:56,710
Good painting says "Keane"

468
00:34:57,414 --> 00:34:58,346
I am Keane

469
00:34:58,882 --> 00:34:59,849
You're Keane

470
00:35:00,517 --> 00:35:01,484
From now on

471
00:35:01,718 --> 00:35:02,878
We are one and the same

472
00:35:12,362 --> 00:35:16,321
My sources say the mayor
should expect a big surprise today

473
00:35:17,134 --> 00:35:19,159
On behalf of the children of the world

474
00:35:19,903 --> 00:35:23,464
I present this painting
Mayor of San Francisco

475
00:35:26,610 --> 00:35:29,602
My man on the street tells me that
Soviet ambassadors in the city

476
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:30,542
Could Talk

477
00:35:31,748 --> 00:35:33,909
In the interest of peace
through culture

478
00:35:34,151 --> 00:35:37,348
Dono this painting people
of the Soviet Union

479
00:35:40,323 --> 00:35:41,312
The Onion

480
00:35:41,591 --> 00:35:42,421
9:30

481
00:35:42,626 --> 00:35:44,389
Crawford Joan has a
Dinner reservations

482
00:35:48,532 --> 00:35:51,729
Ms, Crawford in recognition of his
cinematic genius

483
00:35:52,002 --> 00:35:53,833
We gave this painting!

484
00:35:58,341 --> 00:36:02,801
The cat is out of the bag can reveal
that our local illuminator, Walter Keane

485
00:36:03,079 --> 00:36:04,603
He has opened his own gallery

486
00:36:11,188 --> 00:36:12,815
Rubn drown when you see this

487
00:36:15,525 --> 00:36:17,322
I remember when my mom
He painted it

488
00:36:23,366 --> 00:36:25,994
Segura? It has had to
long time ago

489
00:36:26,636 --> 00:36:27,603
Of course I'm sure

490
00:36:27,804 --> 00:36:30,432
It was in our old apartment
I was on a kitchen bench

491
00:36:31,007 --> 00:36:33,168
Honey're confused

492
00:36:33,376 --> 00:36:34,104
I painted it

493
00:36:34,778 --> 00:36:37,212
My mother did was using
my blue dress

494
00:36:38,949 --> 00:36:40,917
Many little girls have
that dress

495
00:36:41,751 --> 00:36:43,241
Honey, you have a good eye

496
00:36:44,087 --> 00:36:46,647
I painted it but I tried to imitate
the style of your mother

497
00:36:48,124 --> 00:36:49,921
You know how used styles
to paint?

498
00:36:52,762 --> 00:36:53,956
Well you did a good job

499
00:37:13,016 --> 00:37:13,744
hello

500
00:37:14,251 --> 00:37:15,582
Sorry, there had never
done this before

501
00:37:15,852 --> 00:37:17,410
So I do not know ,,,

502
00:37:19,155 --> 00:37:21,953
I was raised a Methodist, if that
a problem can go

503
00:37:22,359 --> 00:37:23,417
No, no please

504
00:37:24,261 --> 00:37:25,626
Do we throw people here

505
00:37:26,096 --> 00:37:26,858
Ok

506
00:37:27,731 --> 00:37:28,755
That worries

507
00:37:30,934 --> 00:37:31,764
Okay ,,,

508
00:37:33,136 --> 00:37:34,228
I lied to my daughter

509
00:37:36,339 --> 00:37:37,397
Why would you do that?

510
00:37:39,242 --> 00:37:42,143
My husband pushed me to do

511
00:37:42,345 --> 00:37:44,836
Only he had never lied before
I'm not that kind of person

512
00:37:45,715 --> 00:37:47,012
Your husband is that kind of person?

513
00:37:51,087 --> 00:37:52,611
I do not think so

514
00:37:53,189 --> 00:37:56,488
He likes to tell stories and
maybe you exaggerate but

515
00:37:58,295 --> 00:37:59,284
He is a good man and

516
00:37:59,563 --> 00:38:02,430
Just trying to save money
buy a house for the family

517
00:38:02,899 --> 00:38:05,697
And the girl, this lie

518
00:38:05,902 --> 00:38:06,869
It will cause damage?

519
00:38:07,103 --> 00:38:08,001
Damage? Do Not

520
00:38:08,238 --> 00:38:08,932
Do Not

521
00:38:09,205 --> 00:38:09,967
No I ,,,

522
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:11,429
I do not ,,,

523
00:38:13,410 --> 00:38:15,071
Just looking for some answers

524
00:38:17,547 --> 00:38:19,640
Well, the modern world is
a complicated place

525
00:38:20,884 --> 00:38:21,646
occasionally

526
00:38:22,319 --> 00:38:24,253
The children should be protected from

527
00:38:24,454 --> 00:38:25,512
certain truths

528
00:38:26,790 --> 00:38:27,950
Do Not

529
00:38:28,191 --> 00:38:29,283
Not

530
00:38:29,559 --> 00:38:33,928
It seems that her husband tries to do
best of an imperfect situation

531
00:38:34,798 --> 00:38:37,460
She was raised Christian, you know what I mean

532
00:38:38,501 --> 00:38:40,128
The man is the head of the family

533
00:38:41,037 --> 00:38:42,299
Maybe I should

534
00:38:43,273 --> 00:38:44,399
Trust your judgment

535
00:38:53,617 --> 00:38:55,710
I think it's scary
ugly and rookie

536
00:38:56,753 --> 00:38:57,685
exact

537
00:38:58,154 --> 00:38:59,052
I love him

538
00:39:04,628 --> 00:39:05,617
We arrived early

539
00:39:06,262 --> 00:39:07,524
Do not tell me?

540
00:39:10,266 --> 00:39:10,994
Thank You

541
00:39:17,540 --> 00:39:18,370
Hey sweetie

542
00:39:18,708 --> 00:39:19,697
That good party

543
00:39:19,909 --> 00:39:20,773
It's happening

544
00:39:21,511 --> 00:39:22,637
Where is your material?

545
00:39:24,581 --> 00:39:26,913
We decided that this single
would be the show of Walter

546
00:39:27,417 --> 00:39:28,213
Oh

547
00:39:28,418 --> 00:39:29,009
You did?

548
00:39:29,285 --> 00:39:30,115
Why would you do that?

549
00:39:31,154 --> 00:39:33,850
Oh because Walter is more
set

550
00:39:34,824 --> 00:39:35,813
Weird, you know?

551
00:39:36,126 --> 00:39:38,959
Walter does not seem the type to paint
adorable kids and hungry

552
00:39:42,232 --> 00:39:43,893
It's really good to see you

553
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:45,599
Thanks future

554
00:39:52,475 --> 00:39:53,703
Your husband has enough talent

555
00:39:56,079 --> 00:39:56,943
Your pints too?

556
00:40:02,185 --> 00:40:03,618
I do not know ,,,

557
00:40:12,529 --> 00:40:13,723
Curiosity causes me your ethnic

558
00:40:14,297 --> 00:40:15,855
How long will I take
paint that piece?

559
00:40:16,166 --> 00:40:16,860
That?

560
00:40:17,534 --> 00:40:19,729
Probably months ,,,

561
00:40:20,203 --> 00:40:21,898
First I thought, sketch

562
00:40:22,439 --> 00:40:24,839
Then find the time
alone with the oils

563
00:40:25,742 --> 00:40:26,572
Oils?

564
00:40:27,110 --> 00:40:28,077
Is not acrylic?

565
00:40:28,778 --> 00:40:29,767
Ah that, if

566
00:40:31,448 --> 00:40:33,279
Yes, it's like

567
00:40:33,516 --> 00:40:34,949
A mixture of ideas

568
00:40:35,985 --> 00:40:37,384
Spinning in my head

569
00:40:39,889 --> 00:40:40,913
So where
you get your ideas?

570
00:40:44,461 --> 00:40:45,393
A do you mean?

571
00:40:46,863 --> 00:40:47,795
I mean

572
00:40:48,631 --> 00:40:50,599
Because they are all images
of children?

573
00:41:21,064 --> 00:41:23,032
Our art critic John Canaday

574
00:41:23,466 --> 00:41:25,661
With a perspective on the
Walter Keane work

575
00:41:26,636 --> 00:41:29,104
Keane's work is
completely without distinction

576
00:41:30,373 --> 00:41:32,500
Not a member of society
Artists West

577
00:41:33,009 --> 00:41:34,567
There is someone important

578
00:41:35,078 --> 00:41:39,412
It is only known for his appearances in
gossip columns

579
00:41:40,784 --> 00:41:43,344
Mr, Keane is why
society needs critical

580
00:41:44,254 --> 00:41:46,620
To protect against such atrocities

581
00:41:48,224 --> 00:41:49,191
Mom?

582
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:51,088
Mom!

583
00:41:51,628 --> 00:41:52,560
I can go ?,

584
00:41:54,864 --> 00:41:55,762
You can not

585
00:41:56,366 --> 00:41:57,424
Mom is busy right now

586
00:42:00,503 --> 00:42:01,367
What are you doing?

587
00:42:10,780 --> 00:42:11,974
Hey sweetie, come

588
00:42:13,016 --> 00:42:14,779
You need to respect
privacy of your mother

589
00:42:16,419 --> 00:42:18,148
Sometimes adults need
time alone

590
00:42:20,056 --> 00:42:20,784
Come

591
00:42:28,765 --> 00:42:30,357
That's the ice cream truck?

592
00:42:36,239 --> 00:42:37,706
Go for a good ice cream!

593
00:42:48,017 --> 00:42:49,712
Out of this world!

594
00:42:53,056 --> 00:42:56,617
I do not feel comfortable with this
I used to do it differently and now ,,,

595
00:42:56,860 --> 00:42:59,693
Jane is fine, went to where the ice cream ,,,

596
00:43:00,396 --> 00:43:02,626
It has new shoes even
a fund for college

597
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:04,967
maybe

598
00:43:05,635 --> 00:43:09,093
Only this dizzy all
madness of the last days

599
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:11,338
I need your help

600
00:43:11,808 --> 00:43:14,743
I want to go on television to
defend our art

601
00:43:16,579 --> 00:43:17,568
Wait, come out on TV?

602
00:43:18,248 --> 00:43:20,011
Yes but, you say?

603
00:43:21,050 --> 00:43:24,315
I mean, that forces me to paint

604
00:43:25,221 --> 00:43:26,085
This?

605
00:43:27,824 --> 00:43:29,917
Maybe you have an obsession
with little girls

606
00:43:31,027 --> 00:43:31,755
adorable

607
00:43:32,862 --> 00:43:33,624
Sorry

608
00:43:34,097 --> 00:43:36,292
Imagine painting them
in the corner

609
00:43:37,333 --> 00:43:38,129
Yes

610
00:43:38,801 --> 00:43:40,564
Perhaps the winter warmth
help me

611
00:43:41,838 --> 00:43:42,896
Walter, art is personal

612
00:43:47,710 --> 00:43:50,440
Which requires a grown man
to paint something?

613
00:43:51,648 --> 00:43:53,275
Because I ,,,

614
00:43:53,516 --> 00:43:56,076
I lived surrounded by six sisters

615
00:43:56,486 --> 00:43:58,386
I grew up in an orphanage

616
00:43:59,222 --> 00:44:00,154
I ,,,

617
00:44:00,390 --> 00:44:01,357
I lived in a world

618
00:44:01,624 --> 00:44:05,151
Where adults were gone
and the kids and kittens

619
00:44:05,395 --> 00:44:08,922
They ran wild for
desolate landscape

620
00:44:10,934 --> 00:44:12,868
What about your streets
why you painted?

621
00:44:13,369 --> 00:44:16,805
Well, I lived, I experienced

622
00:44:17,373 --> 00:44:20,365
Not only were streets and flowers?

623
00:44:20,576 --> 00:44:21,474
Of course not

624
00:44:21,911 --> 00:44:23,310
It was after the war

625
00:44:29,218 --> 00:44:31,618
Destruction everywhere

626
00:44:34,590 --> 00:44:37,081
Travel by continent

627
00:44:38,061 --> 00:44:40,256
The slaughter was horrible

628
00:44:40,997 --> 00:44:44,125
My mind was marked
and my art too

629
00:44:44,968 --> 00:44:46,401
Nothing in my life

630
00:44:46,669 --> 00:44:48,466
He has had much impact

631
00:44:48,738 --> 00:44:50,296
As the sight of the children

632
00:44:51,607 --> 00:44:52,835
The war destroyed

633
00:44:53,142 --> 00:44:54,268
innocence

634
00:44:54,544 --> 00:44:55,704
without parents

635
00:44:55,912 --> 00:44:56,810
homeless

636
00:44:57,080 --> 00:44:58,547
Fighting for trash

637
00:45:00,383 --> 00:45:03,682
This is how my life as a painter

638
00:45:03,886 --> 00:45:05,444
It started suddenly

639
00:45:09,058 --> 00:45:09,956
Thenceforth

640
00:45:10,226 --> 00:45:11,193
I painted

641
00:45:11,394 --> 00:45:12,759
The lost kids

642
00:45:13,229 --> 00:45:14,389
With big eyes

643
00:45:16,366 --> 00:45:17,196
those eyes

644
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:20,096
That always have their
tantalizing quality

645
00:46:00,309 --> 00:46:01,139
How many sales today?

646
00:46:01,611 --> 00:46:02,635
Sales?

647
00:46:02,912 --> 00:46:04,277
None with this public

648
00:46:04,547 --> 00:46:07,277
These people just look,
They can not afford these paintings

649
00:46:07,984 --> 00:46:10,282
But we have given many
posters

650
00:46:22,732 --> 00:46:24,927
I started charging for posters

651
00:46:25,701 --> 00:46:26,963
First five cents, then 10

652
00:46:28,137 --> 00:46:30,401
If people are crazy

653
00:46:32,341 --> 00:46:33,467
But then I started thinking

654
00:46:33,743 --> 00:46:36,337
You would rather sell a painting
$ 500

655
00:46:36,546 --> 00:46:38,605
Or a million posters reproduced
cheaply?

656
00:46:39,315 --> 00:46:41,476
People really do not care
if a copy

657
00:46:41,717 --> 00:46:43,480
They just want art that touches

658
00:46:44,654 --> 00:46:46,383
And we could sell anywhere

659
00:46:47,490 --> 00:46:48,320
Where!

660
00:48:33,729 --> 00:48:35,356
It stinks here, should open
window

661
00:48:36,299 --> 00:48:37,095
What time is it?

662
00:48:38,334 --> 00:48:39,301
6:30

663
00:48:40,203 --> 00:48:41,192
You have there? let me see

664
00:48:41,404 --> 00:48:43,201
Walter No, it's personal

665
00:48:43,406 --> 00:48:45,033
Personal? We are married

666
00:48:45,308 --> 00:48:47,139
We should not hide
each other secrets

667
00:48:48,244 --> 00:48:49,404
Put it up there,
put it up there

668
00:48:59,989 --> 00:49:01,320
It is a style completely
different

669
00:49:03,092 --> 00:49:03,990
Yes, it is

670
00:49:05,061 --> 00:49:06,221
It looks like you

671
00:49:07,330 --> 00:49:08,388
Well, it's ,,,

672
00:49:08,664 --> 00:49:09,562
a self--portrait

673
00:49:14,604 --> 00:49:15,832
I would not know how to explain it

674
00:49:16,606 --> 00:49:17,504
I was thinking that

675
00:49:20,643 --> 00:49:21,575
Maybe I could

676
00:49:21,877 --> 00:49:22,809
Signing myself

677
00:49:23,112 --> 00:49:25,012
That sounds a little confusing,
do not you think?

678
00:49:26,415 --> 00:49:27,643
I mean Keane

679
00:49:28,351 --> 00:49:29,113
I know

680
00:49:29,418 --> 00:49:30,908
But when people ask me
if pinto

681
00:49:31,120 --> 00:49:35,386
I do not know how to respond and be nice
to say, this is mine

682
00:49:36,158 --> 00:49:38,854
Who told him big eyes?
-- Nobody

683
00:49:39,061 --> 00:49:41,586
If you tell someone this
empire collapses

684
00:49:42,965 --> 00:49:44,159
You want to return the money

685
00:49:45,268 --> 00:49:46,735
We have committed fraud

686
00:49:47,003 --> 00:49:47,731
I know

687
00:49:49,272 --> 00:49:50,204
My God, I know

688
00:49:50,406 --> 00:49:51,998
I think about it every minute
of my life

689
00:49:54,043 --> 00:49:55,840
I kept half of the deal

690
00:49:57,113 --> 00:49:59,308
I have not told anyone

691
00:50:01,517 --> 00:50:02,449
Please

692
00:50:02,718 --> 00:50:04,345
Just let me have this

693
00:50:06,522 --> 00:50:07,921
I did not know you painted, Margaret

694
00:50:08,491 --> 00:50:09,788
Yes, do not talk about it

695
00:50:11,193 --> 00:50:13,661
Unfortunately people do not
buy female art

696
00:50:14,063 --> 00:50:15,325
What about Georgia O'Keeffe?

697
00:50:19,101 --> 00:50:20,591
Then Margaret, where
you get your ideas?

698
00:50:24,340 --> 00:50:25,932
Well, the world around me

699
00:50:26,676 --> 00:50:27,938
And I just ,,,

700
00:50:28,411 --> 00:50:30,003
I love Modigliani ,,,
-- Modi what?

701
00:50:31,180 --> 00:50:32,010
Modigliani

702
00:50:32,248 --> 00:50:35,775
Please, it's gossip column,
cling to familiar Angulo

703
00:50:36,619 --> 00:50:38,314
Check out the
little Jane here

704
00:50:39,422 --> 00:50:40,616
That talent!

705
00:50:41,691 --> 00:50:42,749
Look at us to Keane

706
00:50:43,225 --> 00:50:45,659
When you open our veins
bleed oil

707
00:50:53,536 --> 00:50:55,367
Ah a little taste

708
00:50:56,405 --> 00:51:00,273
The fourth member of the
painters Keane

709
00:51:01,043 --> 00:51:02,772
Lily honey, how are you?

710
00:51:03,179 --> 00:51:04,077
I'm fine, Dad

711
00:51:05,314 --> 00:51:06,246
I lost a tooth

712
00:51:06,749 --> 00:51:07,443
Really?

713
00:51:08,851 --> 00:51:09,715
You got into a fight?

714
00:51:10,886 --> 00:51:11,853
No, I fell

715
00:51:12,755 --> 00:51:13,847
Okay!

716
00:51:14,123 --> 00:51:17,923
The tooth fairy is something
I'll deal or your mom and handled it?

717
00:51:18,394 --> 00:51:19,292
She handled it

718
00:51:21,297 --> 00:51:22,195
Well, well

719
00:51:22,465 --> 00:51:23,397
Well, Jane

720
00:51:23,866 --> 00:51:24,628
Come

721
00:51:25,101 --> 00:51:27,262
Come show him the room
of the children

722
00:51:27,536 --> 00:51:28,468
and then

723
00:51:28,671 --> 00:51:31,538
You girls can
have a good time

724
00:51:37,380 --> 00:51:38,244
Walter

725
00:51:38,781 --> 00:51:40,146
You never told me that
had another daughter

726
00:51:42,284 --> 00:51:43,342
I did not? clear

727
00:51:44,253 --> 00:51:45,345
Lily is my first marriage

728
00:51:49,992 --> 00:51:51,016
apology

729
00:51:51,694 --> 00:51:52,626
Sorry, sorry

730
00:51:55,498 --> 00:51:56,328
Walter

731
00:51:56,565 --> 00:51:57,759
I can talk to you?

732
00:52:03,005 --> 00:52:04,029
What's happening there?

733
00:52:04,306 --> 00:52:05,295
That's Lily

734
00:52:05,508 --> 00:52:06,873
Sure that I mentioned

735
00:52:07,576 --> 00:52:08,543
No, you did not

736
00:52:10,379 --> 00:52:11,368
It will move here?

737
00:52:11,614 --> 00:52:12,512
Do Not

738
00:52:13,048 --> 00:52:14,777
His mother go to Vegas
the weekend

739
00:52:15,251 --> 00:52:16,513
I should have it opposes
once a month but

740
00:52:16,752 --> 00:52:17,980
I do not set according to his mom

741
00:52:18,187 --> 00:52:19,950
How could you lie with
something so big?

742
00:52:20,156 --> 00:52:22,420
As it is a very sweet little girl
-- I bet it is

743
00:52:22,925 --> 00:52:25,416
Well I held your daughter
and never said anything

744
00:52:27,129 --> 00:52:28,221
I'll pretend you did not say that

745
00:52:28,697 --> 00:52:29,527
Ok?

746
00:52:29,799 --> 00:52:31,664
Sorry

747
00:52:32,334 --> 00:52:33,801
Please only finish
with this

748
00:52:52,455 --> 00:52:54,252
I have met many
celebrities

749
00:52:54,523 --> 00:52:57,856
And only a certain type of creature
You can live in that light

750
00:52:58,127 --> 00:53:02,188
Walter had that ability,
Margaret? not much

751
00:53:05,100 --> 00:53:06,032
I painted this

752
00:53:06,902 --> 00:53:07,664
Really?

753
00:53:09,104 --> 00:53:09,900
It is very

754
00:53:10,739 --> 00:53:11,706
evocative

755
00:53:13,576 --> 00:53:14,440
sensual

756
00:53:20,883 --> 00:53:22,077
MDH

757
00:53:24,320 --> 00:53:25,378
You are very

758
00:53:25,621 --> 00:53:26,781
mysterious

759
00:53:29,024 --> 00:53:29,752
Yes

760
00:53:30,025 --> 00:53:34,894
Do not use my name because people do not
serious female art

761
00:53:35,097 --> 00:53:36,621
MDH are my initials

762
00:53:37,800 --> 00:53:39,097
And

763
00:53:39,301 --> 00:53:40,427
I'm interested in numerology

764
00:53:40,636 --> 00:53:42,331
As you know, the 7 is a good number

765
00:53:43,739 --> 00:53:44,467
Seven?

766
00:53:45,341 --> 00:53:46,706
Luckily my
maiden name is

767
00:53:46,909 --> 00:53:48,035
Doris Margaret Hawkins

768
00:53:48,244 --> 00:53:49,939
Letter M is number 13
alphabet

769
00:53:50,513 --> 00:53:52,174
D is the number four
H is the number eight

770
00:53:52,381 --> 00:53:54,372
And if one has a
and three from 13

771
00:53:54,850 --> 00:53:56,340
An orgy color

772
00:53:56,919 --> 00:53:57,908
And some ,,,

773
00:53:58,821 --> 00:53:59,753
Sunbeam, sorry

774
00:54:00,456 --> 00:54:02,686
Which makes 4 + 4 + 8

775
00:54:03,092 --> 00:54:05,026
Da 16 and then 1 + 6

776
00:54:05,227 --> 00:54:06,125
da 7

777
00:54:06,328 --> 00:54:06,919
Margaret?

778
00:54:08,364 --> 00:54:09,092
just a moment

779
00:54:12,067 --> 00:54:13,694
Wow, that these babbling?

780
00:54:14,203 --> 00:54:15,033
Divisions?

781
00:54:15,538 --> 00:54:17,472
Could you please help
the world and close your mouth?

782
00:54:18,374 --> 00:54:21,207
They are only interested
in big eyes

783
00:54:21,744 --> 00:54:24,577
Two nuts that fell from the same
tree is insufferable

784
00:54:25,281 --> 00:54:26,908
Why go hungry while
they print money?

785
00:54:27,149 --> 00:54:28,411
Because the nut is a genius

786
00:54:28,884 --> 00:54:29,646
Sell paintings

787
00:54:30,152 --> 00:54:33,986
And sells paintings and images
sells postcards of the images of paintings

788
00:54:34,890 --> 00:54:36,551
I bet you could make a
10 minutes

789
00:54:37,092 --> 00:54:38,423
Would question your sincerity

790
00:54:38,694 --> 00:54:40,252
Ah, customers do not
will realize

791
00:54:47,202 --> 00:54:48,430
Christ is a movement

792
00:55:18,667 --> 00:55:19,998
Hello, DeeAnn

793
00:55:20,402 --> 00:55:22,495
My God, I thought it was
the wrong direction

794
00:55:23,472 --> 00:55:26,032
I know, is a very large entry

795
00:55:26,942 --> 00:55:29,308
I can honestly nor
believe I moved here

796
00:55:30,779 --> 00:55:31,541
I know

797
00:55:31,814 --> 00:55:33,441
We have two acres

798
00:55:33,983 --> 00:55:34,711
a pool

799
00:55:34,917 --> 00:55:36,077
five rooms

800
00:55:36,752 --> 00:55:38,811
I found excessive

801
00:55:39,455 --> 00:55:40,683
Since only ,,,

802
00:55:40,923 --> 00:55:41,855
There are three of us here

803
00:55:43,425 --> 00:55:44,949
Been so long
since I've seen

804
00:55:45,995 --> 00:55:46,859
I know

805
00:55:47,062 --> 00:55:49,860
North Beach is 30 miles
The same would be 300

806
00:55:50,332 --> 00:55:53,733
Well, probably're busy out
with all your rich friends

807
00:55:54,436 --> 00:55:56,097
Please, these are friends
Walter

808
00:55:56,605 --> 00:55:57,629
He brings people here

809
00:55:58,140 --> 00:55:59,300
The Beach Boys came

810
00:56:03,679 --> 00:56:04,873
Are you hungry?

811
00:56:06,448 --> 00:56:07,210
I am thirsty

812
00:56:08,951 --> 00:56:11,385
When we moved I thought
a bar was something extravagant

813
00:56:11,687 --> 00:56:12,415
but

814
00:56:12,621 --> 00:56:14,816
You'd be surprised that both
you can use

815
00:56:15,724 --> 00:56:16,986
So Walter is?

816
00:56:19,328 --> 00:56:20,386
I could not be happier

817
00:56:21,296 --> 00:56:22,695
It has everything you ever dreamed

818
00:56:23,232 --> 00:56:24,062
And you too

819
00:56:25,501 --> 00:56:26,399
fabulous

820
00:56:30,506 --> 00:56:31,530
That is your art studio?

821
00:56:33,609 --> 00:56:35,236
Do you want to go there

822
00:56:35,444 --> 00:56:36,240
I want to look

823
00:56:36,912 --> 00:56:40,143
I want to see what it looks workplace
a successful artist

824
00:56:40,616 --> 00:56:41,810
Oh no, no

825
00:56:42,651 --> 00:56:44,448
DeeAnn? Please do not go there

826
00:56:44,953 --> 00:56:45,647
sight

827
00:56:46,622 --> 00:56:48,055
You can not go in there

828
00:56:53,595 --> 00:56:54,857
Walter pint here too

829
00:56:56,732 --> 00:56:58,461
Walter is at home now?

830
00:57:00,302 --> 00:57:01,462
What the hell happened?

831
00:57:03,505 --> 00:57:04,938
Nothing, I ,,,

832
00:57:05,674 --> 00:57:06,538
I just ,,,

833
00:57:07,242 --> 00:57:09,176
I invited DeeAnn by ,,,

834
00:57:10,679 --> 00:57:13,341
You know I do not like anyone
see my work before finishing

835
00:57:34,369 --> 00:57:37,805
How dare you call
fraud

836
00:57:38,040 --> 00:57:39,667
Shut up, you're a liar, Walter

837
00:57:39,942 --> 00:57:42,536
Get out of my house, my big house

838
00:57:42,811 --> 00:57:47,373
Go to continue looking briefs
fisherman

839
00:57:47,583 --> 00:57:48,345
Fuck

840
00:57:54,623 --> 00:57:56,420
I do not want back
never invite

841
00:57:58,127 --> 00:57:59,025
I will not do

842
00:58:09,772 --> 00:58:10,830
Well, Jane I go to work

843
00:58:11,140 --> 00:58:12,038
I can go?

844
00:58:12,508 --> 00:58:13,770
No, I never can go

845
00:58:14,643 --> 00:58:15,507
I should not even ask

846
00:58:33,495 --> 00:58:34,519
And as you came you here?

847
00:58:35,764 --> 00:58:37,356
Do not you hear
allowed visits?

848
00:58:41,403 --> 00:58:42,597
This has come not?

849
00:58:43,639 --> 00:58:45,937
You're the only living soul
I can tell you my secret

850
00:58:47,476 --> 00:58:48,340
Okay

851
00:58:50,179 --> 00:58:51,271
I painted I

852
00:58:52,381 --> 00:58:53,245
I did it

853
00:58:53,615 --> 00:58:54,980
All and each

854
00:58:55,217 --> 00:58:56,275
All big eyes

855
00:58:57,119 --> 00:58:58,051
I

856
00:58:58,754 --> 00:59:00,381
And no one but you will know

857
00:59:03,392 --> 00:59:04,791
And I will paint another one now

858
00:59:05,894 --> 00:59:09,830
Look what I've come a girl
crazy talking to a dog

859
01:00:24,907 --> 01:00:26,534
A productive day
today

860
01:00:29,111 --> 01:00:31,238
I ran into a hot gossip

861
01:00:31,880 --> 01:00:35,976
The Madame Chiang Kai--Shek
come to town opposite Taipei

862
01:00:37,819 --> 01:00:41,050
I think we should introduce
a painting

863
01:00:41,723 --> 01:00:43,156
Dick's interview

864
01:00:44,693 --> 01:00:45,819
To hell with Dick

865
01:00:46,295 --> 01:00:47,922
I met a new type
UPI

866
01:00:48,730 --> 01:00:49,719
maybe

867
01:00:50,232 --> 01:00:51,597
She would like one of your
street scenes

868
01:00:52,868 --> 01:00:54,961
I know why I did not think you could make a

869
01:00:55,237 --> 01:00:56,727
Trash Chinatown

870
01:00:56,939 --> 01:00:58,167
With adorable and little girls

871
01:00:58,407 --> 01:01:00,739
Something like a mixture of eyes
large and Chinese

872
01:01:02,911 --> 01:01:03,570
Do Not

873
01:01:04,179 --> 01:01:06,909
No, she is a dignitary
and she deserves

874
01:01:07,516 --> 01:01:09,347
A piece that comes directly from you

875
01:01:12,087 --> 01:01:13,054
You think so?

876
01:01:13,889 --> 01:01:14,947
Well, maybe you're right

877
01:01:16,091 --> 01:01:19,527
Probably not have a scene of paris
hung in his palace

878
01:01:19,728 --> 01:01:23,129
Unless the madame and
have a S, Cenic

879
01:01:26,134 --> 01:01:27,260
What did you say?
-- A S, Cenic

880
01:01:28,303 --> 01:01:31,033
Is the painter who did all
your previous work

881
01:01:41,650 --> 01:01:42,878
It was my nickname in Paris

882
01:01:43,518 --> 01:01:46,385
To all my friends paint him
liked both my scenic view

883
01:01:46,655 --> 01:01:48,919
They called me, well they could not
pronounce it properly

884
01:01:49,157 --> 01:01:50,590
I called S, Cenic

885
01:01:52,828 --> 01:01:54,989
The more you lie more
little you look

886
01:01:56,131 --> 01:01:58,224
How dare you accuse me
lying

887
01:01:58,433 --> 01:02:00,128
I am proud of my
previous work

888
01:02:00,402 --> 01:02:01,835
So why paintedst
about the name?

889
01:02:02,671 --> 01:02:04,901
A council never use basis
of water on a oleo

890
01:02:05,440 --> 01:02:06,600
It goes fast

891
01:02:08,010 --> 01:02:10,171
You sound a crazy love
God

892
01:02:10,445 --> 01:02:11,810
You've seen me painting

893
01:02:14,282 --> 01:02:15,340
I have not done

894
01:02:18,153 --> 01:02:19,245
I always thought

895
01:02:19,955 --> 01:02:21,786
He had done it but it's like
a mirage

896
01:02:23,091 --> 01:02:25,059
From a distance you look like a painter

897
01:02:26,061 --> 01:02:27,756
But up close there is not much there

898
01:02:30,966 --> 01:02:32,297
I went to Paris

899
01:02:32,501 --> 01:02:34,492
I studied there

900
01:02:36,905 --> 01:02:38,702
I spent hours and hours

901
01:02:38,974 --> 01:02:40,100
In the Louvre

902
01:02:40,375 --> 01:02:43,173
Looking at the grandeur of the masses
-- Walter

903
01:02:46,181 --> 01:02:47,443
Have you ever been to Paris?

904
01:03:00,328 --> 01:03:04,196
I just wanted to ,,, become
an artist

905
01:03:04,499 --> 01:03:06,194
Just never turned out well

906
01:03:19,247 --> 01:03:20,646
I do not want to sleep here

907
01:03:21,817 --> 01:03:23,216
There are three additional bedrooms
in this house

908
01:03:24,186 --> 01:03:25,175
Go to choose one

909
01:03:47,375 --> 01:03:48,603
The more of these there behind?

910
01:03:49,010 --> 01:03:51,501
I do not know, maybe three thousand or so?

911
01:03:51,546 --> 01:03:52,808
You can print more?
-- Excuse me Miss

912
01:03:53,115 --> 01:03:54,139
How much is this painting

913
01:03:55,083 --> 01:03:56,311
Go, for I pay?

914
01:03:56,551 --> 01:03:57,415
If Mr, Keane

915
01:04:03,692 --> 01:04:05,387
Not even one of mine,
one of hers

916
01:04:16,304 --> 01:04:17,532
This does not change anything

917
01:04:19,975 --> 01:04:20,964
another truth

918
01:04:21,676 --> 01:04:22,608
Who cares?

919
01:04:23,545 --> 01:04:24,910
Maybe it's time to shake
things

920
01:04:26,047 --> 01:04:28,208
And start putting my name
MDH below

921
01:04:28,416 --> 01:04:29,178
Do Not

922
01:04:29,918 --> 01:04:32,512
Absolutely not, and hate me
by letting the first

923
01:04:33,221 --> 01:04:34,245
Shut Up

924
01:04:35,824 --> 01:04:36,916
Do not raise your voice

925
01:04:37,459 --> 01:04:38,756
Oh, I will speak

926
01:04:39,227 --> 01:04:41,058
As strong as you like

927
01:04:41,530 --> 01:04:44,931
Do not do it or I'll kill you

928
01:04:47,102 --> 01:04:47,898
What?

929
01:04:48,103 --> 01:04:49,570
If you tell someone

930
01:04:49,838 --> 01:04:52,306
I watch, I meet people

931
01:04:52,974 --> 01:04:55,169
Remember cousin Banducci,
the seller of liquor wholesale

932
01:04:57,078 --> 01:04:57,976
Are you threatening me?

933
01:05:00,081 --> 01:05:00,911
All Right

934
01:05:01,183 --> 01:05:02,013
Kill Me

935
01:05:02,584 --> 01:05:04,814
My God, I have kept your
secret for years

936
01:05:05,086 --> 01:05:06,553
And not once have I ,,,

937
01:05:09,057 --> 01:05:10,251
You know how hard this
It has been for me?

938
01:05:12,761 --> 01:05:13,750
I have no friends

939
01:05:14,796 --> 01:05:15,728
I lied

940
01:05:15,997 --> 01:05:17,021
My own daughter

941
01:05:21,703 --> 01:05:23,330
Life imitates art

942
01:05:23,872 --> 01:05:25,100
A king crying

943
01:05:27,142 --> 01:05:28,109
Walter, do you want?

944
01:05:31,279 --> 01:05:32,507
Everything with you is calculated

945
01:05:33,848 --> 01:05:35,645
We are back where we had
first date

946
01:05:41,656 --> 01:05:45,023
Look, do not deny it, I need you
you're the one who has the gift

947
01:05:47,262 --> 01:05:49,526
Now, there is an opportunity to ,,,
Oh my God

948
01:05:50,165 --> 01:05:51,826
I am excited

949
01:05:52,901 --> 01:05:54,459
The New York World's Fair

950
01:05:55,537 --> 01:05:57,004
70 million visitors

951
01:05:57,272 --> 01:06:00,139
The opening day, I will show
my masterpiece

952
01:06:00,809 --> 01:06:01,741
That masterpiece?

953
01:06:02,210 --> 01:06:03,040
exact

954
01:06:04,279 --> 01:06:05,906
Where he has been all
this time?

955
01:06:06,114 --> 01:06:07,672
Da Vinci Mona Lisa has its

956
01:06:08,016 --> 01:06:10,007
Renoir has his lunch Fishermen

957
01:06:10,218 --> 01:06:11,742
Where is my final statement?

958
01:06:12,454 --> 01:06:13,512
You sound like crazy

959
01:06:14,789 --> 01:06:17,485
An artist not only announced
his masterpiece

960
01:06:18,393 --> 01:06:19,257
Why not?

961
01:06:19,494 --> 01:06:23,726
Miguel Angelo did not know that to something great
to paint the Sistine Chapel?

962
01:06:24,232 --> 01:06:25,631
It took four years

963
01:06:27,235 --> 01:06:28,361
But this is the best part

964
01:06:29,170 --> 01:06:31,035
It is for UNICEF

965
01:06:31,239 --> 01:06:33,799
UNICEF sponsored the entire education

966
01:06:34,943 --> 01:06:37,707
Finally we will reward the
kids of the world

967
01:07:08,910 --> 01:07:12,903
When people ask me, 'why
It was stood ?, fear, lack of trust? ''

968
01:07:13,782 --> 01:07:16,580
Margaret was trapped in a
lie had helped create

969
01:07:16,851 --> 01:07:18,978
And other coverage was worse
that crime

970
01:07:21,523 --> 01:07:24,788
Why were promised a canvas
this size?

971
01:07:25,493 --> 01:07:28,291
Because it must meet all
kids, all races

972
01:07:28,797 --> 01:07:30,958
Hundreds of faces

973
01:07:31,232 --> 01:07:32,631
Marching to infinity

974
01:07:33,668 --> 01:07:34,794
Latest from Walter Keane

975
01:07:35,670 --> 01:07:39,333
The publisher says it is good for
out a coffee table book

976
01:07:40,008 --> 01:07:41,032
You know, something elegant

977
01:07:41,543 --> 01:07:45,877
The teachers of tomorrow need
my portfolio early

978
01:07:46,715 --> 01:07:48,012
My artistic evolution
-- Yes

979
01:07:48,283 --> 01:07:50,308
Where are all your
preliminary sketches?

980
01:07:51,853 --> 01:07:54,344
All that time you spent in
art school which seem to have

981
01:07:54,589 --> 01:07:57,649
Made all these young experiments
these portraits coal unfinished

982
01:07:58,560 --> 01:07:59,720
They should be here
somewhere

983
01:08:04,232 --> 01:08:05,460
I know you're being
sarcastic

984
01:08:05,667 --> 01:08:10,730
Just some ideas ,,, orphans paints,
early self portraits

985
01:08:11,473 --> 01:08:12,906
Get out of here try to work

986

What about dinner?

988
01:08:22,650 --> 01:08:23,844
Mom're home?

989
01:08:29,557 --> 01:08:30,455
Mom?

990
01:09:19,908 --> 01:09:20,636
Jane

991
01:09:20,909 --> 01:09:22,672
What are you doing in the study of Walter?

992
01:09:26,648 --> 01:09:27,512
I know

993
01:09:28,950 --> 01:09:30,178
You know nothing

994
01:09:31,152 --> 01:09:32,278
I'm not a girl

995
01:09:38,426 --> 01:09:39,120
Jane

996
01:09:55,944 --> 01:09:57,935
Five, six pages

997
01:09:58,446 --> 01:09:59,606
There is something here that I see?

998
01:10:00,281 --> 01:10:02,010
It's like the hula hula

999
01:10:02,317 --> 01:10:03,409

1000
01:10:05,453 --> 01:10:08,251
It will be unveiled at the large pavilion
Hall of education

1001
01:10:09,824 --> 01:10:12,725
International artist and celebrated
has been selected

1002
01:10:14,095 --> 01:10:16,495
To represent aspirations
of the children worldwide?

1003
01:10:17,699 --> 01:10:18,461
This is absurd

1004
01:10:28,543 --> 01:10:30,534
And who was on the committee
selection?

1005
01:10:31,913 --> 01:10:34,245
Well, there was a committee
so to speak

1006
01:10:35,617 --> 01:10:38,415
Just went to lunch with him,
Jerome and I

1007
01:10:38,953 --> 01:10:39,885
And the wife of Jerome

Let

1011
01:10:55,003 --> 01:10:58,700
The World's Fair opens Thursday,
paintings for sale

1012
01:10:59,574 --> 01:11:00,836
On Friday divorce request

1013
01:11:02,710 --> 01:11:04,109
Why are you always so
miserable?

1014
01:11:07,382 --> 01:11:08,110
Okay

1015
01:11:08,383 --> 01:11:11,352

1016
01:11:14,489 --> 01:11:16,286
Ms, Tisdale

1017
01:11:16,524 --> 01:11:17,513
Walter Keane

1018
01:11:18,059 --> 01:11:22,792
I just wanted to thank you for hosting
This lovely evening

1019
01:11:22,997 --> 01:11:24,862
Well, you are welcome

1020
01:11:27,869 --> 01:11:28,836
Hey Keane

1021
01:11:29,504 --> 01:11:30,471
You've seen the New York Times?

1022
01:11:31,172 --> 01:11:35,233
Honestly I've been so busy all
day preparing for this occasion

1023
01:11:35,510 --> 01:11:37,102
I think you should read

1024
01:12:01,936 --> 01:12:03,028
"Terrible"

1025
01:12:03,237 --> 01:12:03,862
'' Grotesque "

1026
01:12:04,072 --> 01:12:05,198
"Disgusting"

1027
01:12:05,406 --> 01:12:07,135
As someone could say something
so cruel?

1028
01:12:07,675 --> 01:12:08,937
That you care?

1029
01:12:09,143 --> 01:12:10,974
My name is trailing
by Iodo

1030
01:12:12,814 --> 01:12:13,803
It is he here?

1031
01:12:14,816 --> 01:12:18,377
If, which is probably
that all ,,,

1032
01:12:23,691 --> 01:12:24,658
Who wrote this shit?

1033
01:12:28,096 --> 01:12:28,960
Mr, Keane

1034
01:12:29,864 --> 01:12:31,126
This is not the way

1035
01:12:31,966 --> 01:12:34,161
You may want to write
a letter to the editor?

1036
01:12:34,936 --> 01:12:35,868
What are you afraid of?

1037
01:12:36,971 --> 01:12:38,563
Just because people do
like my work

1038
01:12:38,840 --> 01:12:40,899
That means it's bad?
-- Do Not

1039
01:12:41,209 --> 01:12:42,870
But neither becomes art

1040
01:12:43,811 --> 01:12:46,109
Art should raise not please

1041
01:12:46,347 --> 01:12:48,281
Particularly if you are in
classroom education

1042
01:12:48,516 --> 01:12:49,915
You have no idea

1043
01:12:50,218 --> 01:12:51,879
Why someone becomes critical?

1044
01:12:52,086 --> 01:12:53,485
Because you can not create

1045
01:12:53,988 --> 01:12:54,852
Oh go

1046
01:12:55,123 --> 01:12:57,387
That tone is not ,,,
-- Do not give me that

1047
01:12:57,825 --> 01:13:00,760
Do not know what to put your
emotions out there

1048
01:13:01,029 --> 01:13:03,224
Naked for all
the world to see

1049
01:13:03,698 --> 01:13:04,756
That emotions?

1050
01:13:04,966 --> 01:13:06,729
It is synthetic work

1051
01:13:07,235 --> 01:13:09,726
Your masterpiece is an infinity
Keane

1052
01:13:10,171 --> 01:13:12,469
What makes it an infinity
garbage

1053
01:13:59,253 --> 01:14:02,245
What's wrong with the child
denominator?

1054
01:14:05,960 --> 01:14:08,121
That this country was built!

1055
01:14:13,334 --> 01:14:18,294
I have to sue them all

1056
01:14:19,207 --> 01:14:20,105
all

1057
01:14:25,079 --> 01:14:27,809
I'll sue this fag critical

1058
01:14:40,595 --> 01:14:42,460
Take that UNICEF

1059
01:14:43,331 --> 01:14:46,767
With your small boxes
nice money

1060
01:14:58,479 --> 01:15:00,344
But you'll be happy, right?

1061
01:15:03,184 --> 01:15:05,618
You made me the ultimate betrayal

1062
01:15:06,921 --> 01:15:09,719
Me down with that picture

1063
01:15:17,965 --> 01:15:19,557
crossed from

1064
01:15:20,001 --> 01:15:23,027
Sentimentality garbage

1065
01:15:25,006 --> 01:15:25,870
Walter for

1066
01:15:38,686 --> 01:15:40,847
You made me look bad

1067
01:15:41,122 --> 01:15:43,317
You made people laugh my

1068
01:15:44,859 --> 01:15:46,292
Open up, open up!

1069
01:15:48,629 --> 01:15:49,653
Let me in!

1070
01:16:06,914 --> 01:16:08,848
I can see you

1071
01:16:22,263 --> 01:16:24,254
I'll take them with smoke

1072
01:16:28,703 --> 01:16:29,727
They will fly as a
atomic bomb

1073
01:16:45,386 --> 01:16:46,580
Where are they?

1074
01:16:59,166 --> 01:17:00,428
I'm so sorry

1075
01:17:00,701 --> 01:17:02,259
Not be the mother I could be

1076
01:17:04,739 --> 01:17:05,933
I should have done this years ago

1077
01:17:07,675 --> 01:17:09,836
Where are we going? Is very cold

1078
01:17:12,513 --> 01:17:13,912
Where we're going we do not need much?

1079
01:17:16,484 --> 01:17:17,314
Hawaii

1080
01:17:19,587 --> 01:17:20,246
Really?

1081
01:17:20,454 --> 01:17:21,113
Yes

1082
01:17:21,589 --> 01:17:23,489
If it is a paradise because there

1083
01:17:24,625 --> 01:17:27,287
There are many birds and flowers

1084
01:17:27,495 --> 01:17:28,393
And beautiful colors

1085
01:17:30,197 --> 01:17:31,994
We will make a new life
for us

1086
01:17:34,135 --> 01:17:34,760
Ok?

1087
01:17:35,603 --> 01:17:36,365
That's my girl

1088
01:18:29,957 --> 01:18:30,651
Hello?

1089
01:18:30,925 --> 01:18:32,916
You were hard to track

1090
01:18:33,227 --> 01:18:34,489
I thought I'd never find you

1091
01:18:36,697 --> 01:18:37,527
Walter

1092
01:18:38,799 --> 01:18:44,135
I'm a little hectic, I received a
strangers papers in the mail today

1093
01:18:45,606 --> 01:18:48,632
It is a form of legal separation
and appreciate that it will sign

1094
01:18:49,643 --> 01:18:50,405
Yes

1095
01:18:50,678 --> 01:18:52,373
Do not you being a bit
impulsive?

1096
01:18:53,881 --> 01:18:55,007
Walter want a divorce

1097
01:18:56,684 --> 01:18:58,481
It hurts to hear you say these words

1098
01:18:58,753 --> 01:19:00,482
Sorry it come
this

1099
01:19:01,355 --> 01:19:02,117
Okay

1100
01:19:02,790 --> 01:19:03,722
I guess

1101
01:19:04,025 --> 01:19:06,960
I could accept separate
if you

1102
01:19:07,628 --> 01:19:10,893
You agree to spend the rights of all
painting produced

1103
01:19:15,369 --> 01:19:16,358
If that's the price

1104
01:19:16,570 --> 01:19:17,662
Really?

1105
01:19:20,674 --> 01:19:21,368
Ok

1106
01:19:22,009 --> 01:19:25,172
Well then we have to consider
future earnings

1107
01:19:25,479 --> 01:19:27,470
God, Walter, the more
need money?

1108
01:19:27,915 --> 01:19:29,815
If you want me out of your life
listen to me

1109
01:19:31,652 --> 01:19:35,213
You'll have to paint 100 paintings more
with the name of Walter Keane

1110
01:19:41,128 --> 01:19:41,958
Jane

1111
01:19:43,731 --> 01:19:45,426
I'll go to the post office,
You want something?

1112
01:19:45,633 --> 01:19:46,998
There I go surfing with the gang

1113
01:19:48,469 --> 01:19:50,369
I think Jane friends
They are a bit wild

1114
01:19:50,638 --> 01:19:51,764
Calm down mom

1115
01:19:52,239 --> 01:19:53,331
You're impossible

1116
01:19:53,574 --> 01:19:55,439
Bring me all the way
to Hawaii

1117
01:19:55,643 --> 01:19:58,510
I make some friends and all
what you do is complain about them

1118
01:19:59,547 --> 01:20:00,912
Maybe you need to make some

1119
01:20:02,216 --> 01:20:04,446
Know that he could not have
friends at home

1120
01:20:05,753 --> 01:20:08,483
That was why hide
pleasant pictures

1121
01:20:49,663 --> 01:20:51,688
Hello, we are visiting all
in the neighborhood

1122
01:20:51,899 --> 01:20:52,923
We have an important message

1123
01:20:53,934 --> 01:20:55,401
We have something to share with you

1124
01:20:55,669 --> 01:20:59,161
About the wonderful things the
kingdom of God will do for mankind

1125
01:21:00,207 --> 01:21:04,405
Well from my point of view I do not see
much good, just pride, theft

1126
01:21:04,612 --> 01:21:05,840
And be bad to each other

1127
01:21:06,714 --> 01:21:08,807
You know what it says on Timothy
1 to 5?

1128
01:21:09,583 --> 01:21:11,312
In recent days

1129
01:21:11,785 --> 01:21:13,377
Critics times that are
difficult deal

1130
01:21:13,621 --> 01:21:14,417
They'll be here

1131
01:21:14,655 --> 01:21:17,180
Because men
worship themselves

1132
01:21:17,892 --> 01:21:19,018
Sounds like my ex husband

1133
01:21:30,137 --> 01:21:30,933
We like to get ?,

1134
01:21:36,810 --> 01:21:37,708
It says right here

1135
01:21:38,145 --> 01:21:41,774
A worshiper of Muhammad should be
honest at all

1136
01:21:43,984 --> 01:21:45,781
I can not believe you left
People go home

1137
01:21:47,454 --> 01:21:48,216
It also says

1138
01:21:49,523 --> 01:21:51,457
No lies, tell the truth

1139
01:21:52,393 --> 01:21:54,224
If you were a thief, do not ever steal

1140
01:21:59,900 --> 01:22:01,800
Shit, this is crazy

1141
01:22:02,002 --> 01:22:02,991
All these copies

1142
01:22:03,470 --> 01:22:05,097
You're like Warhol

1143
01:22:05,306 --> 01:22:05,863
Do Not

1144
01:22:06,340 --> 01:22:07,398
Warhol's how I

1145
01:22:08,509 --> 01:22:10,272
That fool stole my act

1146
01:22:11,979 --> 01:22:13,173
my art

1147
01:22:14,281 --> 01:22:15,305
The manufactures

1148
01:22:15,616 --> 01:22:18,244
Had a factory before knowing
it was a soup

1149
01:22:34,902 --> 01:22:38,167
Oh if we have a special guest
Today, a worldwide celebrity

1150
01:22:38,539 --> 01:22:39,972
Let's give a big welcome

1151
01:22:40,174 --> 01:22:41,266
Margaret Keane

1152
01:22:43,477 --> 01:22:47,538
So it's true that your husband Walter
It is a big seller of paintings in the world?

1153
01:22:52,119 --> 01:22:52,949
Do Not

1154
01:22:53,220 --> 01:22:54,380
Big Lolo

1155
01:22:54,588 --> 01:22:55,714
Everything you just said

1156
01:22:55,923 --> 01:22:56,719
It is false

1157
01:22:58,292 --> 01:22:59,088
one

1158
01:23:00,027 --> 01:23:01,927
Walter and I are no longer married

1159
01:23:02,997 --> 01:23:04,089
And two

1160
01:23:04,565 --> 01:23:07,295
He is not a painter

1161
01:23:11,438 --> 01:23:15,340
But is not the one who makes the
crazy eyes?

1162
01:23:17,478 --> 01:23:18,376
Do Not

1163
01:23:19,013 --> 01:23:21,846
But if he has taken credit
that for 10 years

1164
01:23:24,285 --> 01:23:25,946
I am

1165
01:23:26,620 --> 01:23:28,281
The only painter in the family

1166
01:24:07,995 --> 01:24:09,223
You must be kidding

1167
01:24:09,963 --> 01:24:14,696
They know that bother me? Margaret le
broke the news to a big press buttons

1168
01:24:15,602 --> 01:24:18,127
And there is an excellent reporter
Celebrities like me

1169
01:24:20,274 --> 01:24:21,104
I knew it

1170
01:24:27,448 --> 01:24:28,881
Expected

1171
01:24:38,592 --> 01:24:39,684
Margaret has gone mad

1172
01:24:39,827 --> 01:24:40,794
You have to help

1173
01:24:41,295 --> 01:24:42,193
I need a story

1174
01:24:42,796 --> 01:24:45,629
A national story to calm things

1175
01:24:45,899 --> 01:24:47,526
I do not know Walter

1176
01:24:48,035 --> 01:24:49,866
What he said was quite explosive

1177
01:24:50,070 --> 01:24:51,002
It is crazy!

1178
01:24:51,472 --> 01:24:52,837
Not even make sense

1179
01:24:53,107 --> 01:24:55,507
While I was studying art in Paris

1180
01:24:55,776 --> 01:24:58,040
She was a girl in Tennessee

1181
01:24:58,946 --> 01:24:59,674
sight

1182
01:25:02,549 --> 01:25:03,573
My early drafts

1183
01:25:06,720 --> 01:25:09,382
Orphans Berlin 1949

1184
01:25:11,058 --> 01:25:12,423
Margaret Why would he do that?

1185
01:25:13,494 --> 01:25:14,756
You are sick in the head

1186
01:25:15,529 --> 01:25:17,224
He left me to go to the jungle

1187
01:25:17,831 --> 01:25:19,389
He went with religious fanatics

1188
01:25:22,636 --> 01:25:24,331
Witnesses Muhammad

1189
01:25:25,172 --> 01:25:27,140
Really do not know much about them

1190
01:25:27,975 --> 01:25:29,135
No celebrate Christmas

1191
01:25:29,376 --> 01:25:32,607
They can not salute the flag
do not let Jane go to the prom

1192
01:25:36,950 --> 01:25:38,178
It makes me look crazy

1193
01:25:38,652 --> 01:25:41,553
He says I copy it,
he taught me how to paint

1194
01:25:41,822 --> 01:25:45,383
Using a projector to trace my
work and fill colors

1195
01:25:46,794 --> 01:25:48,056
And how much of that is not true?

1196
01:25:48,562 --> 01:25:49,392
all

1197
01:25:50,097 --> 01:25:51,223
I feel good about myself

1198
01:25:51,432 --> 01:25:55,163
For the first time in years and I can not
Walter let me remove it

1199
01:25:56,904 --> 01:25:59,031
And what if it demands?

1200
01:26:03,811 --> 01:26:05,540
$ 17 million

1201
01:26:05,746 --> 01:26:07,475
The art world is altered

1202
01:26:07,748 --> 01:26:10,342
Today the lawyers present their
opening arguments

1203
01:26:10,584 --> 01:26:12,779
For Margaret Keane
against Walter Keane

1204
01:26:12,986 --> 01:26:14,248
And what according to the newspapers

1205
01:26:14,455 --> 01:26:18,323
Be the case that could produce more
riots in Hawaiian history

1206
01:26:32,873 --> 01:26:33,737
Mr, Keane

1207
01:26:34,007 --> 01:26:35,338
Is not worried about the charges?

1208
01:26:35,909 --> 01:26:37,308
I am very upset

1209
01:26:37,511 --> 01:26:40,173
But luckily I have to this company
news to look after my back

1210
01:26:40,948 --> 01:26:42,575
Hope all this trial is
removed by noon

1211
01:26:42,850 --> 01:26:44,249
My only concern is

1212
01:26:44,551 --> 01:26:47,076
Have someone psychiatric help
this woman

1213
01:26:47,354 --> 01:26:49,254
the need
-- Well, sorry gentlemen

1214
01:26:49,957 --> 01:26:50,787
Excuse me please

1215
01:26:54,361 --> 01:26:56,693
Margaret Keane is a figure
published

1216
01:26:56,897 --> 01:26:59,365
Wherefore must prove that the
statements of our newspapers

1217
01:26:59,566 --> 01:27:01,625
They are aware of probable falsity

1218
01:27:01,902 --> 01:27:05,463
Now there is no evidence to suggest that
our editors knew that these

1219
01:27:05,672 --> 01:27:06,639
Assertions were not true

1220
01:27:06,840 --> 01:27:11,004
We would like to introduce 692 items
in which

1221
01:27:11,211 --> 01:27:12,178
The Ms, Keane

1222
01:27:12,880 --> 01:27:13,812
Credited Mr, Keane

1223
01:27:14,081 --> 01:27:16,549
As the painter called
'' kids with big eyes "

1224
01:27:27,227 --> 01:27:28,694
Few years ago these back?

1225
01:27:29,630 --> 01:27:31,063
The Ms, Keane has made these
statements

1226
01:27:31,265 --> 01:27:32,163
since 1958

1227
01:27:34,668 --> 01:27:36,226
This is a very strange case

1228
01:27:37,871 --> 01:27:40,431
These paintings hang in museums
all over the world

1229
01:27:40,674 --> 01:27:42,039
Accredited Mr, Keane

1230
01:27:43,343 --> 01:27:44,901
And true import

1231
01:27:45,112 --> 01:27:48,377
The Ms, Keane has contributed immensely
to confusion

1232
01:27:50,284 --> 01:27:54,220
It seems impossible that such shares become
the standard level for liability

1233
01:27:55,022 --> 01:27:56,614
So the charge against
is removed

1234
01:27:57,224 --> 01:27:58,418
Thank you Your Honor

1235
01:28:02,696 --> 01:28:03,720
Good luck Keane

1236
01:28:04,364 --> 01:28:05,729
Good luck?
Where do they go?

1237
01:28:06,500 --> 01:28:07,592
We were accused of responsibility

1238
01:28:08,302 --> 01:28:09,428
To you I was accused of slander

1239
01:28:19,646 --> 01:28:20,510
Mr, Keane?

1240
01:28:21,448 --> 01:28:23,439
Seems to have no advice

1241
01:28:24,484 --> 01:28:26,714
Would you like a moment to
order their affairs?

1242
01:28:29,156 --> 01:28:30,521
I've always careful to myself

1243
01:28:30,724 --> 01:28:33,420
I do not need a group of suits
hire to defend my good name

1244
01:28:34,061 --> 01:28:35,119
Proceed!

1245
01:28:49,142 --> 01:28:51,633
I was worried about my
old friend Walter Keane

1246
01:28:52,379 --> 01:28:54,438
The Hawaiian heat may have
cooked his brain

1247
01:28:55,082 --> 01:28:57,676
All he knows cuts
and lawyers

1248
01:28:57,884 --> 01:28:59,784
It comes from Perry Mason on TV

1249
01:29:01,521 --> 01:29:04,217
I am the sole creator of my art

1250
01:29:06,159 --> 01:29:07,683
This is my life

1251
01:29:07,961 --> 01:29:10,088
My contribution to the world

1252
01:29:10,797 --> 01:29:11,695
Mr, Keane

1253
01:29:11,898 --> 01:29:14,458
I told you should ask
question witnesses

1254
01:29:15,202 --> 01:29:16,396
If you act as your own lawyer

1255
01:29:16,603 --> 01:29:18,093
You can not make statements
at this time

1256
01:29:18,438 --> 01:29:19,427
If, fine

1257
01:29:21,308 --> 01:29:23,242
It is difficult to keep everything
this in order

1258
01:29:25,212 --> 01:29:26,076
Ms, Keane

1259
01:29:26,647 --> 01:29:30,515
As expected someone to swallow
his fantastic story?

1260
01:29:31,018 --> 01:29:31,882
Mr, Keane

1261
01:29:37,958 --> 01:29:39,357
Ms, Keane

1262
01:29:40,160 --> 01:29:42,185
Seems to be a lucia

1263
01:29:43,063 --> 01:29:45,088
And reasonably intelligent
woman

1264
01:29:45,932 --> 01:29:48,025
So as you can possibly

1265
01:29:48,335 --> 01:29:51,327
Having come so far with a
farce like that?

1266
01:29:54,508 --> 01:29:56,066
I was forced to it

1267
01:29:57,911 --> 01:29:59,173
You do tapeworms

1268
01:30:02,716 --> 01:30:03,944
I had dominated the

1269
01:30:05,452 --> 01:30:08,683
He was going crazy but you
was what I wanted

1270
01:30:09,589 --> 01:30:10,521
I was afraid and

1271
01:30:11,058 --> 01:30:13,117
He saw no other option
so I followed the game

1272
01:30:13,427 --> 01:30:15,361
I can remind you that this
under oath?

1273
01:30:19,266 --> 01:30:20,494
Just give me

1274
01:30:21,702 --> 01:30:22,896
I allowed

1275
01:30:23,670 --> 01:30:25,570
Take credit for big eyes

1276
01:30:26,740 --> 01:30:28,640
They were a reflection of my feelings

1277
01:30:29,376 --> 01:30:31,503
And showed in the boy

1278
01:30:32,345 --> 01:30:33,471
But I was weak

1279
01:30:35,115 --> 01:30:37,515
No I thought I could leave
and maintaining

1280
01:30:38,518 --> 01:30:39,712
For myself and my daughter

1281
01:30:40,220 --> 01:30:41,244
And he said

1282
01:30:41,455 --> 01:30:44,447
Nobody would support payments without
personality

1283
01:30:47,227 --> 01:30:48,159
Maybe he was right

1284
01:30:50,163 --> 01:30:51,494
You eras

1285
01:30:51,765 --> 01:30:52,891
very talented

1286
01:30:53,166 --> 01:30:54,258
To be charming

1287
01:30:56,036 --> 01:30:58,664
And you're a genius in sales
and promotion

1288
01:31:01,308 --> 01:31:04,709
It seems that described two
different men

1289
01:31:06,213 --> 01:31:09,842
One is a sadistic ogre
and the other

1290
01:31:10,150 --> 01:31:12,175
A lovely gentleman

1291
01:31:12,853 --> 01:31:13,979
That is you Walter

1292
01:31:14,888 --> 01:31:16,014
You Jekyll Hyde

1293
01:31:16,590 --> 01:31:18,023
That is a blatant statement

1294
01:31:18,759 --> 01:31:20,226
I demand that the deleted
log

1295
01:31:20,427 --> 01:31:21,155
denied

1296
01:31:21,895 --> 01:31:23,487
Now, you were cheeky

1297
01:31:23,797 --> 01:31:26,322
Criticabas me constantly,
me you desgastabas

1298
01:31:26,566 --> 01:31:28,295
Saying you'd kill me
if he told the truth

1299
01:31:28,668 --> 01:31:30,932
Well, now I do

1300
01:31:31,138 --> 01:31:31,900
your Honor

1301
01:31:32,939 --> 01:31:34,304
I ask for a mistrial

1302
01:31:34,574 --> 01:31:37,543
You're a liar
do not even know what the truth

1303
01:31:44,351 --> 01:31:45,648
This is not a domestic problem

1304
01:31:46,753 --> 01:31:47,651
Perhaps it is

1305
01:31:47,921 --> 01:31:50,913
But the rest of us have
interest in seeing as resolved

1306
01:31:55,228 --> 01:31:57,162
I regret my excitement

1307
01:31:59,966 --> 01:32:00,796
I am an artist

1308
01:32:03,069 --> 01:32:03,831
maybe

1309
01:32:05,772 --> 01:32:06,761
your Honor

1310
01:32:07,374 --> 01:32:08,932
I call as my witness

1311
01:32:09,709 --> 01:32:12,542
Mr, Walter Stanley Keane

1312
01:32:19,586 --> 01:32:22,020
Swear to tell the truth and nothing
but the truth?

1313
01:32:22,222 --> 01:32:23,416
Yes
-- May God help you

1314
01:32:23,924 --> 01:32:24,754
Yes

1315
01:32:32,999 --> 01:32:33,795
Mr, Keane

1316
01:32:34,634 --> 01:32:37,068
There seems to be many hints

1317
01:32:37,270 --> 01:32:39,170
And conflicting testimony

1318
01:32:39,372 --> 01:32:41,840
On the genesis of big eyes

1319
01:32:42,342 --> 01:32:43,274
you mind

1320
01:32:43,510 --> 01:32:45,535
Clarify this short

1321
01:32:46,046 --> 01:32:48,105
Who gave life to these paintings?

1322
01:32:53,687 --> 01:32:56,019
Well I created these children

1323
01:33:00,894 --> 01:33:03,328
The choreography is not necessary,
just sit and testify

1324
01:33:12,439 --> 01:33:14,339
I had a wonderful life

1325
01:33:14,808 --> 01:33:16,036
He was an artist

1326
01:33:17,177 --> 01:33:20,237
And a friend of many
celebrities

1327
01:33:20,780 --> 01:33:21,474
however

1328
01:33:21,681 --> 01:33:23,046
When I remember everything

1329
01:33:23,717 --> 01:33:25,810
To define that really mattered

1330
01:33:26,820 --> 01:33:30,620
It was dedicated to the
kids hungry world

1331
01:33:33,727 --> 01:33:34,989
It all started in

1332
01:33:36,129 --> 01:33:36,959
Berlin

1333
01:33:37,163 --> 01:33:38,460
After World War II

1334
01:33:38,965 --> 01:33:40,398
orphans

1335
01:33:41,735 --> 01:33:43,862
They were chewing a bare wire

1336
01:33:44,337 --> 01:33:45,531
their bodies

1337
01:33:46,072 --> 01:33:47,130
lacerated

1338
01:33:48,441 --> 01:33:50,068
His fingers wrinkled

1339
01:33:50,810 --> 01:33:51,936
Her big eyes

1340
01:33:54,648 --> 01:33:55,979
The Ms, Joan Crawford

1341
01:33:56,182 --> 01:33:57,114
Made ,,
-- Mr, Keane!

1342
01:33:57,684 --> 01:33:58,582
sit

1343
01:33:59,753 --> 01:34:00,811
Marilyn Monroe

1344
01:34:01,488 --> 01:34:03,012
I will not lie ,,,

1345
01:34:03,490 --> 01:34:07,358
Jerry Louis calls me and tells me want
I paint it to me and my family

1346
01:34:07,827 --> 01:34:09,454
Miss, Natalie Wood

1347
01:34:09,930 --> 01:34:11,056
I was approached

1348
01:34:11,331 --> 01:34:12,298
And he said

1349
01:34:12,799 --> 01:34:18,704
This is the best painting I've
seen in my life!

1350
01:34:19,472 --> 01:34:20,370
It ended

1351
01:34:20,573 --> 01:34:21,403
I have not finished

1352
01:34:21,608 --> 01:34:22,506
In fact if

1353
01:34:22,809 --> 01:34:25,573
I can not stand one more story

1354
01:34:25,779 --> 01:34:27,576
It is not testifying,
He is wandering

1355
01:34:27,847 --> 01:34:30,975
The court records are already quite
full no nonsense stories

1356
01:34:32,352 --> 01:34:34,513
We can stay here until
die of old age but

1357
01:34:34,788 --> 01:34:38,485
It is obvious that this case is summarized his
word against that of Ms, Keane

1358
01:34:39,192 --> 01:34:40,022
Mistrial?

1359
01:34:40,226 --> 01:34:41,386
Do Not! Not a mistrial!

1360
01:34:43,363 --> 01:34:44,193
In my opinion

1361
01:34:44,397 --> 01:34:46,957
There is only one way to clarify this

1362
01:34:49,235 --> 01:34:50,532
Both paint

1363
01:34:54,307 --> 01:34:57,105
Well bring them over here and put
on both sides of the bench

1364
01:35:10,790 --> 01:35:12,621
Now, I do not seek a masterpiece

1365
01:35:13,159 --> 01:35:14,524
I do not know much about these things

1366
01:35:14,728 --> 01:35:16,218
I am a lawyer not a critical
art

1367
01:35:16,463 --> 01:35:18,397
But an hour is enough?

1368
01:35:18,999 --> 01:35:19,988
If Your Honor

1369
01:35:24,304 --> 01:35:25,236
Ok then

1370
01:35:25,772 --> 01:35:27,967
Both have the same supplies

1371
01:35:28,708 --> 01:35:30,300
So without further ado

1372
01:35:30,577 --> 01:35:31,566
Ms, Keane, Mr, Keane

1373
01:35:31,845 --> 01:35:32,777
The court is yours

1374
01:36:40,847 --> 01:36:41,677
Mr, Keane?

1375
01:36:45,118 --> 01:36:46,107
I just put the environment

1376
01:36:48,555 --> 01:36:50,352
I hope the muse arrives

1377
01:36:51,891 --> 01:36:54,086
Well his muse has 58 minutes

1378
01:37:24,858 --> 01:37:26,325
Mr, Keane, right?

1379
01:37:29,696 --> 01:37:33,097
My old shoulder injury
I just go on, have a ,,,

1380
01:37:34,400 --> 01:37:35,765
that muscle

1381
01:37:36,936 --> 01:37:38,028
I have been taking drugs

1382
01:37:38,238 --> 01:37:39,136
Inflammation

1383
01:37:56,122 --> 01:37:57,987
Do not think I can
painting today

1384
01:38:16,776 --> 01:38:19,244
The jury found in favor of
Margaret Keane at all points

1385
01:38:19,512 --> 01:38:21,309
Charges of defamation

1386
01:38:21,581 --> 01:38:22,548
emotional stress

1387
01:38:22,849 --> 01:38:24,282
And I hurt your reputation

1388
01:38:27,120 --> 01:38:28,280
Thank you, thank you very much

1389
01:38:29,889 --> 01:38:31,584
Margaret, as you call
painting?

1390
01:38:33,726 --> 01:38:34,988
Show 224

1391
01:38:38,331 --> 01:38:40,060
Margaret, you could give me
your autograph?

1392
01:38:42,669 --> 01:38:45,900
Two things he cared to Margaret,
his daughter and his paintings

1393
01:38:46,639 --> 01:38:49,267
And after all the crazy twists
his life took

1394
01:38:49,475 --> 01:38:50,601
He loved the final

1395
01:38:50,843 --> 01:38:51,810
for both

1396
01:39:01,154 --> 01:39:03,486
Walter never accepted defeat, he insisted
who was the true artist

1397
01:39:04,090 --> 01:39:07,150
For the rest of his life, died
in 2000, bitter and penniless

1398
01:39:08,294 --> 01:39:13,027
Never produced another painting

1399
01:39:14,500 --> 01:39:17,094
Margaret found personal happiness
and remarried

1400
01:39:17,370 --> 01:39:21,397
After many years in Hawaii, moved
San Francisco and opened a new gallery

1401
01:39:24,978 --> 01:39:31,611
She still paints every day
