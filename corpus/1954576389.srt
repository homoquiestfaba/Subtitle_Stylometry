00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:09,894
- Art Subs -

2
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:15,396
Subtitles
- othelo -

3
00:00:46,549 --> 00:00:49,190
Would you still love me
if I couldn't pay for dinner?

4
00:00:50,161 --> 00:00:51,778
Possibly.

5
00:00:56,328 --> 00:00:57,726
Yeah...

6
00:00:58,944 --> 00:01:00,552
What do we do?

7
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:02,839
I'm thinking.

8
00:01:04,016 --> 00:01:06,092
We can have a big row.

9
00:01:06,971 --> 00:01:10,023
And throw some shit,
they might kick us out.

10
00:01:10,024 --> 00:01:12,674
Been done, I don't want
to draw too much attention.

11
00:01:14,887 --> 00:01:17,885
- What are you doing?
- I'm taking my shoes off.

12
00:01:18,696 --> 00:01:22,498
I'm going to leave first...
and then when the time is right,

13
00:01:22,499 --> 00:01:25,925
like when the maître d'
is not looking,

14
00:01:26,256 --> 00:01:28,139
you meet me down the street.

15
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:01,560
Excuse me, sir.

16
00:02:08,816 --> 00:02:11,023
Hey, run!
Run, run, run!

17
00:02:11,546 --> 00:02:12,960
Oh, fucker!

18
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:43,131
- Baby, are you okay?
- I'm dying.

19
00:02:55,425 --> 00:02:58,475
- Do we lose him?
- I don't know.

20
00:02:59,829 --> 00:03:02,911
Really, I don't think
he even chase us.

21
00:03:25,668 --> 00:03:27,707
- Hey.
- What?

22
00:03:27,709 --> 00:03:30,147
Hey-hey-hey, look-look-look.
Look at them.

23
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:37,788
- This is pretty good, isn't it?
- Yes, it is.

24
00:03:44,101 --> 00:03:46,774
- Hey.
- What?

25
00:03:49,139 --> 00:03:51,424
There is only one heart
in this body.

26
00:03:53,972 --> 00:03:55,795
Have mercy on me.

27
00:04:01,104 --> 00:04:02,706
Shut up.

28
00:05:47,843 --> 00:05:49,242
Hey!

29
00:06:50,117 --> 00:06:53,360
Ms. Ludlow, are you ready?

30
00:06:54,094 --> 00:06:55,492
Yeah.

31
00:07:11,196 --> 00:07:13,035
- Hey.
- Hi.

32
00:07:14,841 --> 00:07:17,888
- Can I... does it kind of hurt?
- No, it's fine.

33
00:07:22,717 --> 00:07:24,565
This is all your stuff?

34
00:07:24,965 --> 00:07:27,365
Let me...
Are you sure?

35
00:07:28,891 --> 00:07:31,139
- Nice meeting you.
- Yeah, have a great day.

36
00:07:38,673 --> 00:07:40,949
- <i>Ça Va la vie d'El?</i>
- <i>Ça Va.</i>

37
00:08:05,033 --> 00:08:06,432
Where's Philip?

38
00:08:08,576 --> 00:08:10,974
He's asleep.
He's exhausted.

39
00:08:12,474 --> 00:08:15,084
- What should I do?
- Just put it somewhere.

40
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:32,999
I closed
your wireless account.

41
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:34,817
Thanks.

42
00:08:34,818 --> 00:08:37,635
What do you want to do
with all your stuff in the city?

43
00:08:39,758 --> 00:08:42,598
You've got some clothes here
in the closet,

44
00:08:42,599 --> 00:08:45,198
and I have some more stuff
in the attic if you want.

45
00:08:45,199 --> 00:08:46,862
I'm sure that will do fine.

46
00:08:53,278 --> 00:08:55,097
Just like old times.

47
00:08:55,949 --> 00:08:57,347
Hey, daddy.

48
00:09:09,663 --> 00:09:11,663
So what happens now?

49
00:09:12,159 --> 00:09:15,565
I'm guessing you give
a speech of some sort?

50
00:09:15,566 --> 00:09:17,408
What do you want to do, El?

51
00:09:17,955 --> 00:09:19,553
Something else.

52
00:09:20,593 --> 00:09:22,047
I'm open to ideas.

53
00:09:22,048 --> 00:09:23,896
You could take some classes.

54
00:09:25,982 --> 00:09:27,979
Can we talk about it later?

55
00:09:28,361 --> 00:09:29,792
What about Conor?

56
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:39,851
- Auntie El.
- Hi!

57
00:09:42,085 --> 00:09:44,905
- Missed you.
- I missed you.

58
00:09:45,567 --> 00:09:48,765
- What did you guys do today?
- Chasing butterflies.

59
00:09:49,944 --> 00:09:52,414
- I "catched" one.
- You did?

60
00:09:52,415 --> 00:09:55,232
Let's give her some time
to get settled in, okay, baby?

61
00:09:55,233 --> 00:09:57,231
- Bye, honey.
- Bye.

62
00:10:04,247 --> 00:10:08,059
- Do you need anything?
- No, thank you.

63
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:11,866
I'm riding to town in a bit.
Wanna join? Get out?

64
00:10:11,867 --> 00:10:15,295
Yeah, you yell up at me
when you're going?

65
00:10:30,323 --> 00:10:31,922
That's brutal, man.

66
00:10:33,442 --> 00:10:35,440
Maybe she wants you
to go after her.

67
00:10:35,441 --> 00:10:36,882
No, she doesn't.

68
00:10:37,376 --> 00:10:39,374
Maybe wait a couple of days
and go after her?

69
00:10:39,375 --> 00:10:40,846
Stu, don't.

70
00:10:42,547 --> 00:10:44,389
Well, I guess...

71
00:10:44,765 --> 00:10:47,801
- When someone flirts with extinction...
- Shut the fuck up.

72
00:10:47,802 --> 00:10:49,471
Okay, I'm sorry,
I don't know what to say.

73
00:10:49,472 --> 00:10:52,128
- What am I supposed to say?
- You don't have to say anything.

74
00:10:52,129 --> 00:10:55,722
Just shut up, drink,
and talk about the weather.

75
00:10:55,723 --> 00:10:58,720
Hey, the dude at table 2
said he's gonna kick your ass

76
00:10:58,721 --> 00:11:00,718
if he doesn't get
his chicken satay soon.

77
00:11:00,719 --> 00:11:03,786
- Tell him he can suck my balls.
- You should tell him that yourself.

78
00:11:03,787 --> 00:11:05,185
Table 2?

79
00:11:05,382 --> 00:11:06,808
I'll deal with it.

80
00:11:07,650 --> 00:11:10,097
- Hey, we're out of beer.
- How can we be out of beer?

81
00:11:10,098 --> 00:11:12,146
We've got two boxes
back there, go and...

82
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:15,908
You don't throw shit in my place, man.
What's your problem?

83
00:11:15,909 --> 00:11:18,790
- Where's our fucking food, man?
- Listen, don't threaten my chef.

84
00:11:18,791 --> 00:11:21,058
- Calm down.
- Don't tell me to calm down.

85
00:11:21,059 --> 00:11:24,289
If you threaten my chef again I will
drop kick you out of the fucking door.

86
00:11:24,290 --> 00:11:26,088
- Are you kidding me?
- Come on...

87
00:11:27,053 --> 00:11:29,532
Stu!

88
00:11:36,002 --> 00:11:37,409
Hey, Conor...

89
00:11:37,410 --> 00:11:39,229
- Get the fuck out!
- Fuck you!

90
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:41,457
Fuck you, man.
What a nice comeback, very nice.

91
00:11:41,458 --> 00:11:43,330
Get out of here you too.

92
00:11:43,715 --> 00:11:45,180
Get out.

93
00:11:45,648 --> 00:11:48,313
Did you get
your stupid sunglasses too?

94
00:11:48,314 --> 00:11:49,794
Fuckhead.

95
00:12:38,036 --> 00:12:40,891
<i>You have reached a number
that is no longer in service.</i>

96
00:12:40,892 --> 00:12:44,119
<i>Please check the number and try
your call again. Thank you.</i>

97
00:12:58,083 --> 00:13:00,300
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Mary?

98
00:13:00,647 --> 00:13:03,322
- <i>Yes?</i>
- It's Conor.

99
00:13:07,745 --> 00:13:09,377
Is El there?

100
00:13:11,951 --> 00:13:14,760
Hello?

101
00:13:16,157 --> 00:13:17,558
Hello?

102
00:14:00,759 --> 00:14:02,226
Hey.

103
00:14:03,525 --> 00:14:05,582
I thought I could...

104
00:14:06,714 --> 00:14:09,122
I thought I could
stay here for a little bit.

105
00:14:12,615 --> 00:14:14,102
Hi, Ralph.

106
00:14:17,791 --> 00:14:19,589
You know where
the guest bedroom is?

107
00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:20,988
Yep.

108
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:23,947
There's towels in that closet
in the hallway,

109
00:14:23,948 --> 00:14:25,779
not much in the fridge.

110
00:14:26,879 --> 00:14:28,710
Got some Cheerios.

111
00:14:28,711 --> 00:14:32,945
That's fine, I mean, I can go
get some stuff, that's easy.

112
00:14:36,987 --> 00:14:38,959
Well, I've gotta head
to the restaurant.

113
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:40,795
- Okay.
- Good night.

114
00:14:40,796 --> 00:14:42,210
Good night.

115
00:15:08,591 --> 00:15:10,472
Wow, hey. Hey, El!

116
00:15:12,918 --> 00:15:15,781
- Hey.
- Hey, Stu.

117
00:15:17,095 --> 00:15:19,909
- How are you?
- You remember of my dad?

118
00:15:20,758 --> 00:15:22,224
Hey.

119
00:15:22,624 --> 00:15:24,686
- How are you?
- Good, thanks.

120
00:15:26,253 --> 00:15:29,867
- You are the chef.
- Yeah, I'm the chef.

121
00:15:30,808 --> 00:15:32,265
Alright...

122
00:15:32,987 --> 00:15:35,984
- How is the restaurant?
- Good.

123
00:15:35,985 --> 00:15:38,277
Yeah, it's going good.
It's going really well.

124
00:15:38,278 --> 00:15:41,493
- El, you have to register.
- We have to head off.

125
00:15:41,494 --> 00:15:44,091
Alright, I gotta get this back
to the restaurant.

126
00:15:44,092 --> 00:15:46,289
- Good to see you.
- Yeah, you too.

127
00:15:47,854 --> 00:15:52,340
Hey, if you ever wanna get
coffee or something...

128
00:15:52,341 --> 00:15:54,595
you know,
shoot me a text or call me.

129
00:15:54,596 --> 00:15:56,844
- Okay.
- Good seeing you.

130
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:07,499
So Lilian is expecting you.

131
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:12,207
- She and I were colleagues at NYU.
- I know, you told me.

132
00:16:13,408 --> 00:16:14,865
You have...

133
00:16:17,014 --> 00:16:20,071
- Pencils and notebooks and all that?
- Yes, dad.

134
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:25,963
I have class and...
I have patients.

135
00:16:26,306 --> 00:16:28,199
So I guess I'll...

136
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:32,090
- See you at your house later at night.
- Okay.

137
00:16:34,252 --> 00:16:36,123
- El...
- Yeah?

138
00:16:36,710 --> 00:16:39,755
- Have a good first day.
- I will.

139
00:16:51,523 --> 00:16:53,972
- How's the weather down there?
- Balmy.

140
00:16:53,973 --> 00:16:56,634
- Do you have an appointment?
- I'm Eleanor Rigby.

141
00:16:58,341 --> 00:17:00,003
That must be tough.

142
00:17:00,004 --> 00:17:03,010
I'm here to talk my way
into your Identity Theory class.

143
00:17:03,011 --> 00:17:05,009
Oh, you're Julian's kid.

144
00:17:05,010 --> 00:17:07,086
I need some caffeine,
are you walking the walk with me?

145
00:17:07,087 --> 00:17:08,486
Okay.

146
00:17:09,066 --> 00:17:11,520
So is Julian
into the Beatles or something?

147
00:17:11,521 --> 00:17:14,133
- Sort of.
- What you mean, "sort of"?

148
00:17:15,393 --> 00:17:17,731
He met my mom
on the street,

149
00:17:17,732 --> 00:17:20,070
during one of the
Beatles hoaxed reunions.

150
00:17:20,461 --> 00:17:22,516
There was a rumor
they were gonna play a show here

151
00:17:22,517 --> 00:17:25,534
before Lennon died, just like the one
they did in the rooftop in London.

152
00:17:25,535 --> 00:17:27,147
My parents stood next
to each other,

153
00:17:27,148 --> 00:17:29,238
waiting for the band
that never showed.

154
00:17:29,239 --> 00:17:30,851
<i>Nostalgies.</i>

155
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:36,021
That and my dad's surname
is Rigby.

156
00:17:36,022 --> 00:17:39,454
- You must detest the Beatles.
- No, not really.

157
00:17:41,247 --> 00:17:42,645
You want something?

158
00:17:48,605 --> 00:17:51,026
Double espresso,
three Splendas, please.

159
00:17:56,191 --> 00:17:58,389
So why do you wanna be
in my class?

160
00:17:58,939 --> 00:18:00,987
Your course sound interesting.

161
00:18:01,713 --> 00:18:05,392
And, look...
You are a colleague of my dad, so...

162
00:18:05,393 --> 00:18:07,602
Well, you gotta do better
than that.

163
00:18:08,352 --> 00:18:11,378
- You want me to make something up?
- Well, most people do.

164
00:18:12,733 --> 00:18:15,490
You're just taking classes
just to take classes, right?

165
00:18:15,491 --> 00:18:17,989
- Something like that.
- Well, let me save you some time.

166
00:18:17,990 --> 00:18:20,014
All the perpetual students
that hedge fund wives

167
00:18:20,015 --> 00:18:21,941
in your generation
of too many choices

168
00:18:21,942 --> 00:18:23,761
they usually go
to Tim Gunn's class

169
00:18:23,762 --> 00:18:25,812
listen to him talk
about Project Runway.

170
00:18:25,813 --> 00:18:27,518
Or you can take
the Art History class

171
00:18:27,519 --> 00:18:29,151
on the advent
of color photography

172
00:18:29,152 --> 00:18:31,821
just for a good
cocktail party conversation.

173
00:18:33,055 --> 00:18:35,456
"My generation
of too many choices"?

174
00:18:35,457 --> 00:18:37,707
Democracy has its drawbacks.

175
00:18:39,232 --> 00:18:42,467
- Double espresso, three Splendas.
- Thank you.

176
00:18:45,283 --> 00:18:49,539
You're teaching classes
just to teach classes, right?

177
00:18:51,753 --> 00:18:53,364
Something like that.

178
00:18:58,430 --> 00:19:02,315
I'm having a month.
I'm sorry.

179
00:19:03,312 --> 00:19:07,519
Your father didn't give me much warning
or tell me much about you.

180
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:09,744
And I'm really not one
for nepotism.

181
00:19:10,349 --> 00:19:14,390
I just got the call asking
if I could squeeze you into a class.

182
00:19:17,550 --> 00:19:19,610
So I don't really know
who you are.

183
00:19:20,096 --> 00:19:21,544
It's okay.

184
00:19:22,863 --> 00:19:24,504
Neither do I.

185
00:20:05,834 --> 00:20:09,226
- You want to help me?
- Are you making honeys?

186
00:20:11,788 --> 00:20:15,875
With summer vegetables and...
and some basil.

187
00:20:16,542 --> 00:20:19,355
You remember when you
first had them, in Le Baron?

188
00:20:19,356 --> 00:20:20,765
No?

189
00:20:21,362 --> 00:20:24,964
You were 4.
And you were so fat.

190
00:20:26,841 --> 00:20:29,065
My mother and I would cook
a big plate of them

191
00:20:29,066 --> 00:20:30,892
and leave that
on the kitchen table.

192
00:20:31,193 --> 00:20:37,186
And you would eat one and the other...
until the plate was completely empty.

193
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:41,232
You went to nursery school
that fall.

194
00:20:41,233 --> 00:20:45,012
And all these women gave me
was weird looks and...

195
00:20:45,470 --> 00:20:48,346
they were wondering
what I was feeding you with.

196
00:20:48,347 --> 00:20:51,998
- I was a butterball.
- I felt completely stupid.

197
00:20:53,028 --> 00:20:56,628
Like I had no idea what I was doing,
the way those women looked at me.

198
00:20:56,629 --> 00:20:59,460
- Did you?
- Did I what?

199
00:20:59,461 --> 00:21:01,274
Did you know
what you were doing?

200
00:21:02,112 --> 00:21:04,550
I think I didn't realise
I wouldn't be able to retrieve

201
00:21:04,551 --> 00:21:06,908
all the opportunities
that there were then.

202
00:21:10,845 --> 00:21:14,291
You're not the only one
who has done stupid things to herself.

203
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:17,268
My darling.

204
00:21:21,761 --> 00:21:23,409
I have no clue where she's gone.

205
00:21:23,410 --> 00:21:26,686
She turns off her cell phone
and like that she's vanished.

206
00:21:27,186 --> 00:21:28,818
Does that make sense to you?

207
00:21:28,819 --> 00:21:30,667
- No, Conor.
- Come on, knock it off.

208
00:21:30,668 --> 00:21:34,532
No, no, I'm like, you know...
How'd you call that? I plead the fifth.

209
00:21:34,961 --> 00:21:38,960
I tried to be helpful, I pretended,
but it didn't workout.

210
00:21:38,961 --> 00:21:40,389
It's not gonna be of help.

211
00:21:40,390 --> 00:21:43,206
Look, I realise that I've been
a little off-balance lately,

212
00:21:43,207 --> 00:21:46,694
but I think with hindsight
I'm learning to deal with it better.

213
00:21:46,695 --> 00:21:49,936
- A couple of weeks counts as hindsight?
- Fucking A, Stu.

214
00:21:50,246 --> 00:21:51,648
I've got nothing for you.

215
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:55,287
Come on, come on...
I'm just asking a simple question.

216
00:21:55,288 --> 00:21:59,116
You don't have to candy cover it
like you're gonna hurt my feelings...

217
00:21:59,117 --> 00:22:00,952
but did you see
this coming?

218
00:22:01,156 --> 00:22:02,754
Look,
with the exception of my dog,

219
00:22:02,755 --> 00:22:06,387
I haven't slept next to the same person
for more than 2 or 3 days in a row,

220
00:22:06,388 --> 00:22:07,803
so I don't know
what I'm gonna say

221
00:22:07,804 --> 00:22:10,019
that is gonna be relevant
to your situation.

222
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:12,019
I opened a restaurant
for you, asshole.

223
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:14,617
No, you opened
a restaurant for you, asshole.

224
00:22:15,102 --> 00:22:18,326
And according to the Village Voice
it's a bar with uninspired food.

225
00:22:18,327 --> 00:22:21,571
Whatever, look... I'm simply asking
for my best friend's opinion.

226
00:22:21,572 --> 00:22:23,903
Even if it is
an uninformed piece of crap.

227
00:22:23,904 --> 00:22:25,395
Okay.

228
00:22:25,688 --> 00:22:27,355
<i>"We are young</i>

229
00:22:28,954 --> 00:22:31,801
<i>Heartache to heartache

230
00:22:32,101 --> 00:22:34,333
<i>No promises,
no demands</i>

231
00:22:34,833 --> 00:22:36,275
<i>Love is a battlefield"</i>

232
00:22:36,276 --> 00:22:39,314
- Pat Benatar.
- You're a fucking idiot.

233
00:22:43,256 --> 00:22:45,304
I feel like I walk
on eggshells around you.

234
00:22:46,689 --> 00:22:48,102
You know, I...

235
00:22:48,408 --> 00:22:50,452
I tried to talk to you
about this for months...

236
00:22:50,453 --> 00:22:53,698
- I'm not talking about that.
- This is what I'm talking about, man.

237
00:22:53,999 --> 00:22:56,229
I don't know how to be
your friend anymore.

238
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:59,800
You're no fucking picnic.

239
00:23:05,611 --> 00:23:08,013
Look, I saw her
the other day.

240
00:23:08,742 --> 00:23:10,575
You what?
- Saw her.

241
00:23:10,576 --> 00:23:12,415
- Where?
- Astor Place.

242
00:23:15,021 --> 00:23:16,668
- Did you talk to her?
- No.

243
00:23:16,669 --> 00:23:18,306
- You didn't talk to her?
- No.

244
00:23:18,307 --> 00:23:22,901
She was far away, walking away,
going to class or something.

245
00:23:22,902 --> 00:23:24,356
Class?

246
00:23:24,357 --> 00:23:27,966
- Yeah, she had book bag with her.
- What school?

247
00:23:27,967 --> 00:23:29,771
NYU or Cooper Union or...

248
00:23:29,772 --> 00:23:32,971
I don't know,
it's not hard to find out.

249
00:23:32,972 --> 00:23:35,188
- Why didn't you tell me?
- I just did.

250
00:23:35,189 --> 00:23:38,434
- What are you guys talking about?
- You.

251
00:25:32,410 --> 00:25:33,883
Okay?

252
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:39,644
I'm not here to approve...

253
00:25:39,931 --> 00:25:42,791
or disapprove,
just so you know.

254
00:25:44,021 --> 00:25:48,422
Your mother always gave me crap
for never stepping up to the plate.

255
00:25:50,413 --> 00:25:52,046
Okay, what?

256
00:25:53,272 --> 00:25:55,524
She sad I never stepped up.

257
00:25:56,310 --> 00:25:58,545
I'm sorry, what does that
have to do with anything?

258
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:02,403
Well, you are
a bit like me.

259
00:26:02,404 --> 00:26:05,070
No, I'm fucking not.
I stepped up.

260
00:26:05,833 --> 00:26:07,631
Okay.

261
00:26:07,650 --> 00:26:10,856
- So what else?
- Nothing.

262
00:26:11,535 --> 00:26:13,579
Nothing, we don't have
to keep talking.

263
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:16,020
Yeah, but you are the one
who came into the room.

264
00:26:16,021 --> 00:26:18,433
Yeah, to turn down
your stupid music.

265
00:26:18,803 --> 00:26:23,427
Everyday I do one thing
that makes me happy.

266
00:26:23,428 --> 00:26:26,270
Right? One thing,
and that is either...

267
00:26:26,305 --> 00:26:29,723
listen to my stupid music
or read this stupid paper.

268
00:26:29,724 --> 00:26:32,192
And that is the best way
I found to deal with myself.

269
00:26:32,193 --> 00:26:33,867
So just go...

270
00:26:34,839 --> 00:26:38,836
back to the guestroom
and count the fucking raindrops.

271
00:26:39,161 --> 00:26:41,220
Count
the fucking raindrops?

272
00:26:42,893 --> 00:26:46,321
I was never very good
at this kind of thing.

273
00:26:50,887 --> 00:26:52,301
Okay...

274
00:26:53,453 --> 00:26:55,899
It isn't your job to...

275
00:26:55,900 --> 00:27:00,362
investigate the expansive memory
that is called "the past"

276
00:27:00,363 --> 00:27:05,167
and judge what is right
and what isn't.

277
00:27:05,168 --> 00:27:07,988
Seriously, what the fuck
are you talking about.

278
00:27:12,508 --> 00:27:15,560
You shouldn't be interested
in regretting things.

279
00:27:17,251 --> 00:27:18,720
I'm not.

280
00:28:02,966 --> 00:28:04,773
Let's do this.

281
00:28:05,594 --> 00:28:07,996
"Intuitive answer
to this question.

282
00:28:07,997 --> 00:28:10,642
At bottom,
the sense of Self corresponds

283
00:28:10,643 --> 00:28:13,697
to that experience
of ownership...

284
00:28:13,698 --> 00:28:17,331
and impenetrability
of one's thoughts,

285
00:28:17,332 --> 00:28:20,935
of one's
internal dialogues,

286
00:28:20,936 --> 00:28:24,137
of one's
affective states...

287
00:28:24,777 --> 00:28:29,234
that many but not all of us
have from infancy."

288
00:28:29,466 --> 00:28:32,071
Can I borrow
a piece of paper and a pen?

289
00:28:34,268 --> 00:28:35,729
Please.

290
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:43,978

291
00:28:46,279 --> 00:28:47,695

- Just give me a second of talk.

- Just give me goddamn a second.

00:31:10,313 --> 00:31:12,152
Well, that was exciting.

326
00:31:13,230 --> 00:31:14,902
Yeah, it was awesome.

327
00:31:21,569 --> 00:31:26,237
So, you're back to school?

328
00:31:26,999 --> 00:31:29,241
I'm taking some classes.

329
00:31:32,962 --> 00:31:35,416
I almost didn't recognize you.

330
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:37,762
What do you mean?

331
00:31:38,914 --> 00:31:40,968
It's just your hair.

None of your business.

335
00:32:05,625 --> 00:32:08,511
Was that what you so desperately
needed to talk to me about?

336
00:32:08,512 --> 00:32:09,910
No.

337
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:12,344
What is it then?

338
00:32:17,716 --> 00:32:20,064
I was gonna say
something good.

339
00:32:21,143 --> 00:32:22,953
Something that would've...

340
00:32:23,907 --> 00:32:26,747
solved all our problems
and made everything all better,

341
00:32:26,748 --> 00:32:29,346
but, you know what?
I forgot what it was.

342
00:32:37,741 --> 00:32:40,360
- That is too bad.
- Ain't it?

343
00:32:45,642 --> 00:32:48,678
- I'm gonna go.
- No...

344
00:32:49,841 --> 00:32:51,477
All I want...

345
00:32:52,608 --> 00:32:54,865
Is a chance to talk it out.

346
00:32:55,867 --> 00:32:58,932
And after that
you can disappear.

347
00:32:58,933 --> 00:33:00,731
Wherever it is
you disappear to.

348
00:33:00,732 --> 00:33:02,282
Ready, sir?

349
00:33:04,835 --> 00:33:07,459
Damn.
Yeah, I was born ready.

350
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:10,099
Nice and easy.
Watch your step.

351
00:33:12,281 --> 00:33:13,925
I'll see you around.

352
00:33:15,756 --> 00:33:17,813
All right, watch your head
coming up.

353
00:33:17,814 --> 00:33:19,499
- Got him?
- I got him.

354
00:33:20,186 --> 00:33:21,848
Take it easy.

355
00:33:27,563 --> 00:33:29,713
- Put your arm here for me.
- Okay.

356
00:33:33,410 --> 00:33:35,267
Can I keep stalking you?

357
00:33:56,031 --> 00:33:58,059
Are you awake?

358
00:33:59,906 --> 00:34:03,753
Auntie El, are you awake?
No, Philip.

359
00:34:04,005 --> 00:34:06,055
Your eyes are open.

360
00:34:06,915 --> 00:34:08,749
Apparently.

361
00:34:10,265 --> 00:34:13,077
Why do you have
your shoes on in bed?

362
00:34:23,319 --> 00:34:25,350
Morning, sunshine.

363
00:34:26,630 --> 00:34:30,902
I was making french toast.
- All right, I'll be right down.

364
00:34:30,903 --> 00:34:32,312
Okay.

365
00:35:08,649 --> 00:35:10,526
Came in late last night.

366
00:35:15,671 --> 00:35:17,316
What's with the feast?

367
00:35:17,317 --> 00:35:20,378
We have a special guest star.

368
00:35:21,478 --> 00:35:22,885
Outside.

369
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:31,841
Well, it's been hard.
There is a barrier...

370
00:35:34,378 --> 00:35:35,780
Good morning.

371
00:35:40,675 --> 00:35:42,921
- No fucking way.
- El.

372
00:35:47,451 --> 00:35:49,666
You sandbagged me.

373
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:55,798
He chose
the Psychology Department.

374
00:35:56,990 --> 00:35:58,389
Good for him.

375
00:35:59,595 --> 00:36:02,847
Well, I just thought he'd be
a bit more qualified...

376
00:36:04,056 --> 00:36:08,281
to deal with your circumstance.
What's my circumstance?

377
00:36:24,458 --> 00:36:26,498
He was my grandson.

378
00:36:28,495 --> 00:36:30,710
I lost him too.

379
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:50,878
None of us know
how to help you.

380
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:52,848
Well, neither do I.

381
00:36:58,768 --> 00:37:01,767
So glad they delegated
the speech to you.

382
00:37:07,032 --> 00:37:09,039
He's not a stranger...

383
00:37:09,892 --> 00:37:13,901
that some hospital referred you to,
he's a colleague of mine.

384
00:37:17,032 --> 00:37:20,469
I don't think one session
a week would hurt.

385
00:37:20,470 --> 00:37:22,914
Why can't you talk to me
once a week, dad?

386
00:37:22,915 --> 00:37:24,381
Why outsource it?

387
00:37:24,382 --> 00:37:26,411
I'm not outsourcing it,
and I don't really think

388
00:37:26,412 --> 00:37:28,420
you wanna talk
to me about it.

389
00:37:28,661 --> 00:37:31,468
I don't need to talk
to another therapist.

390
00:37:31,858 --> 00:37:33,327
Eleanor...

391
00:37:33,328 --> 00:37:36,729
Please, stop reminding me
that something is wrong.

392
00:37:36,730 --> 00:37:39,587
That's not my intention.

393
00:37:39,588 --> 00:37:43,041
Then please let me stop
thinking about it.

394
00:37:52,523 --> 00:37:55,177
Tragedy is a foreign country.

395
00:37:56,499 --> 00:37:59,112
We don't know how to talk
to the natives.

396
00:38:00,409 --> 00:38:02,220
What are you talking about?

397
00:38:29,877 --> 00:38:33,697
You know, there's this
really cool thing called chairs.

398
00:38:33,698 --> 00:38:35,780
Yeah, I've heard about those.

399
00:38:35,781 --> 00:38:38,246
It's actually
not too shabby down here.

400
00:38:40,947 --> 00:38:42,567
You're okay?

401
00:38:43,988 --> 00:38:46,822
- Sure.
- Liar.

402
00:38:47,210 --> 00:38:48,692
Sure.

403
00:38:50,609 --> 00:38:53,669
- When is your next class?
- It's yours.

404
00:38:59,155 --> 00:39:01,372
You like hamburgers?

405
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:05,503
I used to be a vegan...

406
00:39:06,428 --> 00:39:08,875
Mostly 'cause my husband
was a vegan.

407
00:39:09,490 --> 00:39:13,697
Not that I don't agree with most
of the tenets of vegan ideology, but...

408
00:39:14,163 --> 00:39:15,990
He was one of those
reformed socialists

409
00:39:15,991 --> 00:39:18,864
who seemed sexy before
the 60's started to fade.

410
00:39:19,350 --> 00:39:21,002
Does he teach?

411
00:39:21,285 --> 00:39:24,889
He won tenure at University
of Oregon, I got it here.

412
00:39:24,890 --> 00:39:28,340
He was soft, I stayed hard.
That was it.

413
00:39:31,305 --> 00:39:34,169
- You've kids?
- A son.

414
00:39:34,677 --> 00:39:37,140
I'm not sure why
people have kids.

415
00:39:38,398 --> 00:39:41,019
First there's the 9 months
of agony...

416
00:39:41,691 --> 00:39:44,924
your body hurts, it's hot, it's cold,
you crave pickles and...

417
00:39:44,925 --> 00:39:48,123
there's no words to describe
whatever fuck the labor is.

418
00:39:48,124 --> 00:39:49,831
Then this little stranger
comes out,

419
00:39:49,832 --> 00:39:51,539
sucking every bit of
life you have left in you,

420
00:39:51,540 --> 00:39:54,140
and as soon as you are ready
to jump out of the window...

421
00:39:54,141 --> 00:39:56,175
all of a sudden he smiles.

422
00:39:59,549 --> 00:40:01,748
Jesus Christ, this is good.

423
00:40:02,675 --> 00:40:05,508
And whatever you do,
however you do it...

424
00:40:05,509 --> 00:40:09,707
however you imagine your child's life,
what kind of parenting you did,

425
00:40:09,708 --> 00:40:12,118
29 years later he is
in some shrink office,

426
00:40:12,119 --> 00:40:13,926
accusing you
of some stupid thing

427
00:40:13,927 --> 00:40:15,964
that you said or did
that for the life of you

428
00:40:15,965 --> 00:40:18,004
you can't remember
saying or doing.

429
00:40:24,519 --> 00:40:27,962
Tell me that, at your age, you're not
taking classes out of boredom.

430
00:40:29,839 --> 00:40:31,874
I don't know
what the hell I'm doing.

431
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:34,148
What was before this?

432
00:40:35,406 --> 00:40:37,253
Life in general.

433
00:40:37,884 --> 00:40:39,286
Any kids?

434
00:40:41,538 --> 00:40:45,785
- Boy or girl.
- Boy.

435
00:40:45,786 --> 00:40:48,449
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

436
00:40:48,990 --> 00:40:52,430
Who was that man that chased you
out of my classroom the other day?

437
00:40:58,021 --> 00:41:01,894
He went soft, I stayed hard,
that was that.

438
00:41:07,942 --> 00:41:11,157
- Well, it's been real, everybody.
- No, it hasn't.

439
00:41:11,733 --> 00:41:13,176
Hey! Goddamn it.

440
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:15,306
Slow night?

441
00:41:15,307 --> 00:41:17,362
A couple of people came in
to use the bathroom.

442
00:41:17,363 --> 00:41:18,762
How are we doing?

443
00:41:18,763 --> 00:41:21,567
Well, aside from being
an endangered species?

444
00:41:21,568 --> 00:41:24,420
- Not so good.
- Can you translate that for me, please?

445
00:41:24,421 --> 00:41:27,868
Friday night. This is the only night
we're making any money.

446
00:41:28,185 --> 00:41:33,989
I have missing bills
and we can't cover the overhead.

447
00:41:34,669 --> 00:41:36,892
- I see.
- Yeah.

448
00:41:37,978 --> 00:41:39,783
You got a plan B?

449
00:41:40,576 --> 00:41:42,042
Burger King?

450
00:41:44,039 --> 00:41:45,708
Seriously? Come on,
I wanna show you something.

451
00:41:45,709 --> 00:41:48,532
- This is the spreadsheet...
- No, I can't.

452
00:41:54,173 --> 00:41:55,788
You got protection?

453
00:41:57,487 --> 00:41:59,321
- Viagra?
- Please, be quiet.

454
00:41:59,322 --> 00:42:00,788
- You want me...
- Shut your mouth.

455
00:42:00,789 --> 00:42:02,192
- My what?
- Shut up.

456
00:42:02,193 --> 00:42:04,213
Dude, I'm being serious,
shut up. I believe.

457
00:42:04,214 --> 00:42:07,214
- In what?
- Higher power, can you hear it?

458
00:42:07,215 --> 00:42:08,693
Not right now.

459
00:42:08,694 --> 00:42:10,528
- Later.
- Bye.

460
00:42:10,529 --> 00:42:12,545
- Bye.
- You guys have fun.

461
00:42:18,249 --> 00:42:20,852
- You know, I got a plan B.
- Do you?

462
00:42:21,331 --> 00:42:23,975
You know, you can
get out of here.

463
00:42:23,976 --> 00:42:27,414
I was thinking about getting
my real estate license.

464
00:42:27,327 --> 00:42:28,756
What?

465
00:42:30,425 --> 00:42:34,826
Why would you
do something like that?

466
00:42:34,827 --> 00:42:39,090
'Cause it seems more impressive
than pouring drinks.

467
00:42:39,091 --> 00:42:42,008
Does it? What happened
to your life in the arts?

468
00:42:42,009 --> 00:42:47,255
That will probably faze it into a...
Sunday afternoon hobby kind of thing.

469
00:42:47,256 --> 00:42:48,738
You?

470
00:42:48,979 --> 00:42:53,386
Plus, I think it's kind of indecent
to have things so worked out

471
00:42:53,387 --> 00:42:56,455
that they wind up exactly
like you thought they would.

472
00:42:59,965 --> 00:43:01,606
Are you gonna be okay?

473
00:43:05,020 --> 00:43:06,622
Probably.

474
00:43:07,223 --> 00:43:10,054
We're living a world
full of probablys.

475
00:43:11,839 --> 00:43:15,469
Well, I'm a decent listener...

476
00:43:15,907 --> 00:43:20,342
if you ever want to talk
about whatever.

477
00:43:21,529 --> 00:43:23,132
Talking about
whatever is overrated,

478
00:43:23,133 --> 00:43:26,544
I prefer to see the things stew
inside of me and then have a violent...

479
00:43:33,150 --> 00:43:34,820
Why did you do that for?

480
00:43:36,209 --> 00:43:39,057
Just seemed like the next
interesting thing to do.

481
00:43:40,305 --> 00:43:44,118
- I'm kind of married.
- I don't mind.

482
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:50,416
I cannot do.

483
00:43:50,417 --> 00:43:54,227
- There's nobody looking.
- You know, in another life...

484
00:44:02,354 --> 00:44:04,029
We shouldn't do this.

485
00:44:05,030 --> 00:44:08,053
When was the last time
that you got laid properly?

486
00:44:12,677 --> 00:44:14,942
Fuck, I can already taste
the regret.

487
00:44:14,943 --> 00:44:17,375
Stop thinking,
because it's unhealthy for you.

488
00:44:17,376 --> 00:44:19,225
- Alexis...
- Yes.

489
00:44:19,226 --> 00:44:22,636
- Tomorrow is gonna be awkward.
- Probably.

490
00:45:48,806 --> 00:45:50,419
I'm sorry.

491
00:45:51,385 --> 00:45:54,612
- I wasn't expecting you.
- No, no, no.

492
00:45:54,613 --> 00:45:57,821
I wasn't
expecting me either.

493
00:45:59,869 --> 00:46:01,498
- Hi.
- Hey.

494
00:46:04,243 --> 00:46:05,852
Is she here?

495
00:46:07,872 --> 00:46:09,526
No.

496
00:46:10,352 --> 00:46:12,225
Is she living here?

497
00:46:15,779 --> 00:46:19,440
- Do you want to come in for a second?
- Will that be all right?

498
00:46:20,428 --> 00:46:22,091
Yeah, come in.

499
00:46:26,136 --> 00:46:28,198
Can I ask
how she's doing?

500
00:46:32,695 --> 00:46:35,217
I don't know,
to be completely honest.

501
00:46:37,244 --> 00:46:39,078
As good as she can be.

502
00:46:53,469 --> 00:46:55,927
Do I seem like
a different person to you?

503
00:46:56,969 --> 00:46:59,768
Do you feel
like a different person?

504
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:02,279
I kind of.

505
00:47:03,591 --> 00:47:05,429
You look the same to me.

506
00:47:07,266 --> 00:47:08,688
You know I didnt like you

507
00:47:08,689 --> 00:47:11,391
when Eleanor first brought
you out here for dinner.

508
00:47:13,094 --> 00:47:15,542
However long ago it was...

509
00:47:15,543 --> 00:47:18,703
- How long ago was it?
- Seven years.

510
00:47:20,110 --> 00:47:22,447
- Seven years!
- Yeah.

511
00:47:25,446 --> 00:47:28,509
You sat there in the exact same spot
seven years ago.

512
00:47:28,510 --> 00:47:32,320
With a glass of water because you were
afraid of having a drink in front of me.

513
00:47:33,812 --> 00:47:35,696
This obnoxiously
perfect kid

514
00:47:35,697 --> 00:47:38,381
who walked off with my
daughter's attention.

515
00:47:40,915 --> 00:47:44,120
- You grew on me, though.
- Oh, well.

516
00:47:45,357 --> 00:47:46,826
It's true.

517
00:47:51,147 --> 00:47:52,806
Look I...

518
00:47:53,683 --> 00:47:56,297
I dont want to interfere
with her life...

519
00:47:56,886 --> 00:47:59,688
or whatever she has to do,

520
00:47:59,689 --> 00:48:04,554
but I can't just chalk this
up to destiny.

521
00:48:05,868 --> 00:48:08,466
I walked on
with my life because...

522
00:48:08,467 --> 00:48:12,119
moving forward
was the only way to go.

523
00:48:15,896 --> 00:48:18,498
I guess people grieve
differently.

524
00:48:19,125 --> 00:48:23,355
I'd wish to be some appropriate,
articulate thing to say, but...

525
00:48:23,356 --> 00:48:25,769
I just wanted
the mundane daily bullshit back.

526
00:48:25,770 --> 00:48:28,201
I think Eleanor wanted
something else.

527
00:48:31,151 --> 00:48:33,596
And I think that...

528
00:48:35,503 --> 00:48:39,772
there was nothing appropriate
about any of this.

529
00:49:16,184 --> 00:49:17,635
Hey!

530
00:49:18,827 --> 00:49:20,432
Guess what.

531
00:49:21,084 --> 00:49:23,905
- What?
- I got asked on a date.

532
00:49:32,776 --> 00:49:35,613
- I feel fat.
- Katy, shut up.

533
00:49:38,767 --> 00:49:41,393
You are not fat.

534
00:50:04,867 --> 00:50:06,481
That's gorgeous.

535
00:50:07,097 --> 00:50:08,970
<i>Goddammit!</i>

536
00:50:10,883 --> 00:50:14,910
Excuse me?
Hey, come in here.

537
00:50:17,150 --> 00:50:18,583
What was that?

538
00:50:19,022 --> 00:50:21,457
This keeps breaking off.

539
00:50:21,458 --> 00:50:24,739
Okay, but we don't
say that, lovie.

540
00:50:24,740 --> 00:50:29,405
- Why?
- 'Cause it's not a nice thing to say.

541
00:50:29,406 --> 00:50:31,209
Are you sure
that you're okay to watch him?

542
00:50:31,210 --> 00:50:33,636
Mom and dad
should be back pretty soon.

543
00:50:34,612 --> 00:50:37,233
He's here.
Are you sure?

544
00:50:37,234 --> 00:50:38,632
Yes, I'm positive!

545
00:50:38,791 --> 00:50:40,847
- Let's...
- Change, right?

546
00:50:47,613 --> 00:50:49,852
So what do you wanna do?

547
00:50:52,617 --> 00:50:54,677
What do you wanna do?

548
00:50:56,534 --> 00:50:59,746
Can I get electrocuted
by lightening bugs?

549
00:50:59,747 --> 00:51:02,347
No, they're harmless.

550
00:51:17,854 --> 00:51:20,871
This song is horrible.

551
00:51:21,899 --> 00:51:24,363
- It's not good.
- No, it's not.

552
00:51:24,864 --> 00:51:28,083
I think that bad music
turns you on.

553
00:51:29,152 --> 00:51:30,581
Seriously.

554
00:51:30,582 --> 00:51:33,605
Wow, car, car!
Do this thing!

555
00:51:35,519 --> 00:51:38,155
I don't want them to see
your thang-thangs.

556
00:51:40,191 --> 00:51:41,791
Okay, we're good.

557
00:51:43,509 --> 00:51:45,314
- Help me.
- What?

558
00:51:45,476 --> 00:51:47,148
You know what you're doing?

559
00:51:48,287 --> 00:51:49,907
You're stupid!

560
00:51:51,649 --> 00:51:53,660
- Here you go, shall I do it?
- Yeah.

561
00:51:53,661 --> 00:51:55,928
Okay, this is kinda
counter-intuitive.

562
00:51:56,523 --> 00:52:00,960
I think I'm instinctually wired
not to be able to do this.

563
00:52:02,464 --> 00:52:03,919
Yeah...

564
00:52:04,566 --> 00:52:10,003
3, 2, 1. Just like that.

565
00:52:10,004 --> 00:52:12,461
- You look good!
- Very impressed.

566
00:52:14,298 --> 00:52:16,143
Do we have
to listen to this?

567
00:52:24,101 --> 00:52:27,708
- Hey!
- You want it? You want it?

568
00:52:27,709 --> 00:52:30,178
- Pop?
- What? No.

569
00:52:30,179 --> 00:52:32,631
- Country?
- No!

570
00:52:39,387 --> 00:52:41,639
- Can I have some?
- You got.

571
00:52:41,700 --> 00:52:43,338
Baby...

572
00:52:43,339 --> 00:52:46,201
As comfortable as this is,

573
00:52:47,541 --> 00:52:50,385
I'm losing circulation
in my legs.

574
00:52:51,357 --> 00:52:53,626
- What are you trying to say?
- That you're fat.

575
00:52:53,627 --> 00:52:56,476
And I love
every pound of you.

576
00:52:56,477 --> 00:52:57,875
Come here.

577
00:53:01,124 --> 00:53:04,437
- Have you seen my shirt, El?
- I put it at the back seats.

578
00:53:09,693 --> 00:53:12,534
- Where are you going?
- On here.

579
00:53:18,729 --> 00:53:20,172
You coming?

580
00:53:21,265 --> 00:53:22,712
Yeah!

581
00:53:34,903 --> 00:53:38,313
- Where are we?
- Someplace good.

582
00:53:42,408 --> 00:53:46,018
<i>All the things
you said to me</i>

583
00:53:46,019 --> 00:53:50,014
<i>I was so obsessed</i>

584
00:53:50,015 --> 00:53:54,211
<i>You were always talking,
talking</i>

585
00:53:54,212 --> 00:53:57,879
<i>God I did my best</i>

586
00:53:57,880 --> 00:54:01,729
<i>Heaven is cold
Without any soul</i>

587
00:54:02,973 --> 00:54:04,411
Amazing.

588
00:54:12,025 --> 00:54:16,657
<i>I was so in love with you</i>

589
00:54:17,829 --> 00:54:23,822
<i>It's hard to believe
I was so in love with you</i>

590
00:55:12,682 --> 00:55:14,538
It went that badly?

591
00:55:17,768 --> 00:55:20,983
I could have given him
a normal kiss of good night

592
00:55:20,984 --> 00:55:23,430
instead of jamming my tongue
down his throat.

593
00:55:38,229 --> 00:55:42,511
- So he's cool?
- I'm so fucked...

594
00:55:46,266 --> 00:55:49,928
- You had a little drink tonight?
- Yeah.

595
00:55:56,042 --> 00:55:57,865
What's that?

596
00:55:57,866 --> 00:56:01,100
Philip gave it to me
so I wouldn't be afraid of the dark.

597
00:56:02,810 --> 00:56:05,029
Still having trouble
with that?

598
00:56:05,030 --> 00:56:07,094
Yeah, I guess so.
Come on.

599
00:56:11,982 --> 00:56:14,030
Were you okay with him?

600
00:56:15,011 --> 00:56:16,424
Yeah.

601
00:56:17,013 --> 00:56:21,259
Oh, I don't mean...
That's not what I was...

602
00:56:22,295 --> 00:56:25,711
- I just...
- I'm okay.

603
00:56:25,712 --> 00:56:29,932
- Is it okay to be okay?
- Yeah, be okay all you want.

604
00:56:38,467 --> 00:56:40,509
Are you really okay?

605
00:56:41,063 --> 00:56:43,066
I can pretend.

606
00:57:01,470 --> 00:57:03,934
All of a sudden
I kind of miss him.

607
00:57:06,253 --> 00:57:07,719
Who?

608
00:57:08,696 --> 00:57:10,311
Conor.

609
00:57:18,163 --> 00:57:20,813
He came by the house
the other day.

610
00:57:20,814 --> 00:57:22,850
He talked with mom...

611
00:57:24,247 --> 00:57:26,516
and she told me
not to tell you.

612
00:57:39,706 --> 00:57:43,725
- I'm sorry, Katie.
- What for?

613
00:57:44,125 --> 00:57:45,938
I feel like I just dropped in
on you guys

614
00:57:45,939 --> 00:57:48,384
and I sucked all the air
out of the room.

615
00:57:48,385 --> 00:57:50,827
You were
kind of a selfish bitch.

616
00:57:51,310 --> 00:57:52,925
Hey!

617
00:57:52,926 --> 00:57:55,128
You don't have to be
so honest.

618
00:57:56,609 --> 00:57:59,830
- I was really mad at you.
- I know.

619
00:58:00,226 --> 00:58:03,093
- I'm still really mad at you.
- I know.

620
00:58:08,146 --> 00:58:10,950
And you pulled the floorboards out
from under Conor.

621
00:58:18,011 --> 00:58:20,826
He threw Cody's stuff
into the closet.

622
00:58:22,623 --> 00:58:26,645
And then 10 minutes later
he ordered Chinese.

623
00:58:32,211 --> 00:58:34,233
I tried for six months.

624
00:58:37,134 --> 00:58:40,356
We were million of miles away
in the same room and...

625
00:58:43,627 --> 00:58:46,842
I started to think thoughts
I'd never thought I'd have.

626
00:58:57,259 --> 00:58:59,664
How have you and mom
made it this far?

627
00:59:00,977 --> 00:59:02,638
I'm not sure.

628
00:59:08,046 --> 00:59:09,679
Endurance?

629
00:59:13,957 --> 00:59:17,230
Everyone starts out
thinking this is forever.

630
00:59:20,283 --> 00:59:22,343
Then things get hard.

631
00:59:23,558 --> 00:59:25,613
At some point or another.

632
00:59:27,734 --> 00:59:31,805
And then other things don't pan out
the way you thought they would.

633
00:59:43,582 --> 00:59:45,823
I suppose the trick is
not running for the hills

634
00:59:45,824 --> 00:59:48,877
even when you think
it's the most rational thing to do.

635
00:59:58,047 --> 00:59:59,656
I don't know.

636
01:00:06,236 --> 01:00:10,249
- I hate this room.
- I've seen worse.

637
01:00:15,684 --> 01:00:18,105
- Where?
- Huh?

638
01:00:18,106 --> 01:00:20,108
Where have you seen worse?

639
01:00:20,109 --> 01:00:23,351
- NYU, Yale...
- Yale is butt-ugly.

640
01:00:23,352 --> 01:00:25,394
New Haven's butt-ugly.

641
01:00:27,466 --> 01:00:30,492
Did you attend any
of those fine institutions?

642
01:00:30,493 --> 01:00:33,547
NYU. And then I grew up
at Yale, my dad was there.

643
01:00:33,548 --> 01:00:36,376
Of course,
you were a faculty brat.

644
01:00:37,639 --> 01:00:40,488
You and my son would get along
like cupcakes.

645
01:00:40,730 --> 01:00:43,394
Not that I'm trying
to set you up or anything.

646
01:00:43,395 --> 01:00:45,411
He lives in Washington State.

647
01:00:45,412 --> 01:00:49,033
He's been pretending to write
a novel there for the last 4 years.

648
01:00:51,661 --> 01:00:54,305
Learned anything
interesting in NYU?

649
01:00:54,642 --> 01:00:58,842
- I abandoned in dissertation.
- Bold!

650
01:00:58,843 --> 01:01:02,242
- What department?
- Anthropology.

651
01:01:02,560 --> 01:01:04,386
Sociolinguistic?

652
01:01:04,387 --> 01:01:05,785
I was writing an ethnography

653
01:01:05,786 --> 01:01:08,611
on the social world
of performance artists of Paris.

654
01:01:08,612 --> 01:01:11,470
Musicians, dancers,
actors, etc.

655
01:01:12,688 --> 01:01:14,140
Why?

656
01:01:15,959 --> 01:01:21,205
I don't know, my mom is
a musician and she's french, so...

657
01:01:21,206 --> 01:01:24,055
I mean,
why did you abandon it?

658
01:01:24,783 --> 01:01:28,019
Don't tell me something
stupid like love.

659
01:01:32,925 --> 01:01:34,985
You're very talkative.

660
01:01:35,786 --> 01:01:39,843
- I'm more fond of listening to you.
- You'll get over that.

661
01:01:43,726 --> 01:01:45,538
I got pregnant.

662
01:01:48,723 --> 01:01:50,744
Oh, that.

663
01:02:22,508 --> 01:02:24,151
Come on, wake up.

664
01:02:32,173 --> 01:02:33,636
Wake up.

665
01:02:58,500 --> 01:03:00,362
<i>Mais, qu'est-ce
que t'as foutu?</i>

666
01:03:00,846 --> 01:03:02,306
What?

667
01:03:02,307 --> 01:03:04,067
I went into your room
to check about you

668
01:03:04,068 --> 01:03:06,301
and you were gone
and the car was gone.

669
01:03:07,380 --> 01:03:11,026
- Yeah, I went for a drive.
- Well, don't ever do it again.

670
01:03:12,842 --> 01:03:15,055
Why were you
checking on me?

671
01:03:15,056 --> 01:03:16,921
I've always checked on you.

672
01:03:24,620 --> 01:03:26,690
You're feeling
a bit dramatic today?

673
01:03:26,691 --> 01:03:28,500
No, why?

674
01:03:46,384 --> 01:03:48,789
I played
second violin on this.

675
01:03:50,344 --> 01:03:52,959
Boston Symphony,
Zach Proman.

676
01:03:52,960 --> 01:03:54,359
I haven't forgotten.

677
01:03:55,074 --> 01:03:57,732
No, I was
just reminding myself.

678
01:04:17,070 --> 01:04:18,540
What?

679
01:04:26,214 --> 01:04:28,825
I never wanted
to be a mother.

680
01:04:28,826 --> 01:04:31,274
Not much you can do
about that now...

681
01:04:32,907 --> 01:04:35,122
Yeah, it's too late.

682
01:04:37,323 --> 01:04:39,325
I was too young
when I had you.

683
01:04:39,326 --> 01:04:42,776
- I was the baby.
- Why are you telling me this?

684
01:04:42,777 --> 01:04:47,007
I'm telling you this because
I don't want to lie to you.

685
01:04:47,008 --> 01:04:50,450
I don't want you to take
our relationship too personally.

686
01:04:52,146 --> 01:04:53,958
I don't.

687
01:04:57,758 --> 01:05:01,379
- No.
- Give me my wine!

688
01:05:01,380 --> 01:05:04,624
Why didn't you tell me Conor came
by the house the other day?

689
01:05:07,277 --> 01:05:09,544
Run for your life, El.

690
01:05:10,109 --> 01:05:12,334
What is that supposed
to mean?

691
01:05:12,335 --> 01:05:15,381
Well, this is all too realistic,
run away for a while.

692
01:05:15,382 --> 01:05:17,257
You're sure
you're not projecting?

693
01:05:17,258 --> 01:05:20,315
Yes, I'm sure
I'm not projecting.

694
01:05:20,316 --> 01:05:21,944
You liked
your semester in Paris,

695
01:05:21,945 --> 01:05:25,161
so why don't you go back there
and finish your dissertation?

696
01:05:25,120 --> 01:05:27,194
You could write in cafes...

697
01:05:27,195 --> 01:05:29,394
read Le Monde, Elisa Hawke.

698
01:05:29,395 --> 01:05:30,873
Eat bread.

699
01:05:31,512 --> 01:05:33,335
Make eyes with strangers.

700
01:05:35,192 --> 01:05:36,644
Yeah, I could.

701
01:05:38,271 --> 01:05:40,515
So why are you still here?

702
01:05:41,340 --> 01:05:42,811
I don't know.

703
01:05:46,174 --> 01:05:49,178
- I don't get it man.
- Let's hope you get it.

704
01:05:49,688 --> 01:05:51,086
Well, your...

705
01:05:51,387 --> 01:05:54,659
Well, your dad is like
a culinary maverick,

706
01:05:54,660 --> 01:05:56,919
he's like the Mick Jagger
of the restaurant game.

707
01:05:56,920 --> 01:05:59,574
All you gotta do is make one
phone call and that saves our asses,

708
01:05:59,575 --> 01:06:01,426
but instead...

709
01:06:01,427 --> 01:06:05,498
you want us to drown like 90%
of the other restaurants in the city.

710
01:06:05,499 --> 01:06:07,263
- I don't get it.
- Stu...

711
01:06:07,949 --> 01:06:09,402
What did he do?

712
01:06:09,403 --> 01:06:11,852
- What you mean?
- Your dad, what did he do?

713
01:06:11,853 --> 01:06:13,675
At least take a page out
of his book, what did he do?

714
01:06:13,676 --> 01:06:15,717
- He married my mom.
- What's that mean?

715
01:06:15,718 --> 01:06:17,550
It means he married my mom.

716
01:06:17,551 --> 01:06:19,776
She gave him all the money
that our family left her

717
01:06:19,777 --> 01:06:21,250
and he opened
the restaurant,

718
01:06:21,251 --> 01:06:23,509
it was a big success,
then he dropped her like a bad habit.

719
01:06:23,510 --> 01:06:24,922
So, you know what?

720
01:06:24,923 --> 01:06:27,763
Why don't you go and find yourself
some lonely loaded ol'lady

721
01:06:27,764 --> 01:06:29,633
and then we can take it
from there.

722
01:06:29,634 --> 01:06:32,652
I'd rather fail
catastrophically than...

723
01:06:32,653 --> 01:06:35,502
give him the satisfaction of thinking
he handed me my life in a platter.

724
01:06:35,503 --> 01:06:38,723
That is the stupidest thing
in the history of stupid things.

725
01:06:38,724 --> 01:06:41,398
Why is that stupid?
You know what is stupid?

726
01:06:41,399 --> 01:06:43,226
You think I'm gonna call my dad
and he's gonna go like:

727
01:06:43,227 --> 01:06:45,258
"Hey, son. Why don't you come
and bring your friends?"

728
01:06:45,259 --> 01:06:46,904
- "They can work here too".
- Yeah.

729
01:06:46,905 --> 01:06:48,579
Its not like a fucking
slumber party.

730
01:06:48,580 --> 01:06:51,227
- I was not... It's a job!
- Stu...

731
01:06:51,228 --> 01:06:53,872
- As decent a cook you are...
- I'm a chef.

732
01:06:53,873 --> 01:06:55,674
All right, chef.

733
01:06:55,675 --> 01:06:57,331
You don't exactly cut it
in those kitchens.

734
01:06:57,332 --> 01:07:00,165
Oh, relax, you don't wanna
have this conversation.

735
01:07:00,166 --> 01:07:01,843
You know, let's talk about it.

736
01:07:01,844 --> 01:07:04,079
When was the last time
you joined in the care?

737
01:07:04,080 --> 01:07:06,100
- Seriously.
- Really wanna have this conversation?

738
01:07:06,101 --> 01:07:08,721
When was the last time you cooked
and egg and you didn't plunge the yolk?

739
01:07:08,722 --> 01:07:14,375
In all kind of kitchens
in that world you would be a busboy.

740
01:07:14,376 --> 01:07:16,983
- You fuckhead, fucking failure.
- No, I'm telling you.

741
01:07:18,229 --> 01:07:19,903
Stupid fucking...

742
01:07:20,898 --> 01:07:22,297
Like that?

743
01:07:24,306 --> 01:07:26,107
You'll hit me
with a fucking kale?

744
01:07:27,929 --> 01:07:29,734
That all you got?
Come on.

745
01:07:30,042 --> 01:07:31,857
Oh, God. Jesus.

746
01:07:42,691 --> 01:07:45,490
Okay, yeah.
This is what you want?

747
01:07:49,241 --> 01:07:50,644
Is that a joke?

748
01:07:50,645 --> 01:07:52,847
No, I think they're
really going at it.

749
01:07:53,866 --> 01:07:55,926
We're not quite open yet.

750
01:07:59,006 --> 01:08:01,211
I was third in my class...

751
01:08:01,212 --> 01:08:03,851
at the New York Academy
of Culinary Arts, you fuckhead.

752
01:08:03,852 --> 01:08:05,706
I know that, asshole.

753
01:08:08,447 --> 01:08:10,087
I'm a chef.

754
01:08:11,734 --> 01:08:13,202
Hey...

755
01:08:13,719 --> 01:08:15,953
I love
our little set up here.

756
01:08:16,363 --> 01:08:17,839
I do.

757
01:08:19,325 --> 01:08:21,762
It's just the lease has gotten
prohibitively expensive

758
01:08:21,763 --> 01:08:24,177
and unless you want
to camp out in the kitchen...

759
01:08:25,070 --> 01:08:28,884
Yes, I would.
I'll bring the sleeping bags.

760
01:08:31,319 --> 01:08:34,154
It's just time to let go.

761
01:08:36,463 --> 01:08:39,920
- Time to grow up.
- Hey, I'm growing up.

762
01:08:39,921 --> 01:08:42,762
- I am.
- Fine.

763
01:08:46,725 --> 01:08:48,747
When do we call it quits?

764
01:08:49,245 --> 01:08:51,064
End of next week.

765
01:08:57,396 --> 01:09:01,130
Can we have one last banger
before we close up shop?

766
01:09:01,131 --> 01:09:02,530
Yeah.

767
01:09:04,466 --> 01:09:07,878
- Can we abuse some heavy narcotics?
- Whatever tickles your thing.

768
01:09:07,879 --> 01:09:09,326
Good.

769
01:09:09,769 --> 01:09:11,204
I'm sorry.

770
01:09:11,572 --> 01:09:13,584
- Blow me.
- Okay.

771
01:09:21,460 --> 01:09:22,899
Yeah, it's amazing.

772
01:09:22,900 --> 01:09:25,359
- Doing well?
- Okay...

773
01:09:25,360 --> 01:09:26,958
Good.

774
01:09:33,070 --> 01:09:36,014
Sorry, it was not a...

775
01:09:36,015 --> 01:09:39,078
Holy shatner.

776
01:09:39,371 --> 01:09:41,427
Nice to see you too, Stuart.

777
01:09:45,171 --> 01:09:46,576
Well, this was nice.

778
01:09:46,577 --> 01:09:48,291
Like old times,
reconnecting and all.

779
01:09:48,292 --> 01:09:50,347
- I'm gonna go to the kitchen.
- Yeah.

780
01:09:51,420 --> 01:09:53,485
I will join you.

781
01:10:22,427 --> 01:10:24,031
Shirley Temple?

782
01:10:24,754 --> 01:10:26,173
Please.

783
01:10:40,681 --> 01:10:42,102
What do I owe you?

784
01:10:42,757 --> 01:10:45,008
Your money is no good here,
you know that.

785
01:10:45,649 --> 01:10:47,065
Okay.

786
01:10:50,250 --> 01:10:53,306
- Business is good?
- It's great.

787
01:10:56,654 --> 01:10:58,285
We're closing.

788
01:11:01,799 --> 01:11:04,007
- I'm sorry.
- Yeah.

789
01:11:04,521 --> 01:11:06,393
Yeah, me too.

790
01:11:15,417 --> 01:11:18,235
- So what's next?
- I don't know.

791
01:11:19,511 --> 01:11:21,531
I thought I might...

792
01:11:22,962 --> 01:11:24,760
develop some interest
in things

793
01:11:24,761 --> 01:11:27,611
that people actually take
an interest in.

794
01:11:27,612 --> 01:11:29,441
You're gonna work
with your dad?

795
01:11:37,105 --> 01:11:40,131
Before you I had
no idea who I was.

796
01:11:42,135 --> 01:11:44,137
Then when we were
together...

797
01:11:45,095 --> 01:11:47,500
I thought I had it all
figured out.

798
01:11:49,960 --> 01:11:53,443
Now I'm just back
to wondering again.

799
01:11:56,942 --> 01:12:00,592
When you figure it out
tell me how, okay?

800
01:12:00,978 --> 01:12:02,387
Okay.

801
01:12:05,644 --> 01:12:08,443
- Let's get out of here.
- What?

802
01:12:08,444 --> 01:12:10,079
- Let's go.
- Right now?

803
01:12:10,080 --> 01:12:12,079
Yeah, that's the idea.

804
01:12:14,920 --> 01:12:16,346
Okay.

805
01:12:27,903 --> 01:12:29,917
Don't forget to fill it up
before you drop it off.

806
01:12:29,918 --> 01:12:31,317
You got it.

807
01:13:16,169 --> 01:13:17,997
- That...
- What are you doing?

808
01:13:17,998 --> 01:13:21,055
You wanna listen to that?

809
01:13:21,408 --> 01:13:24,221
Yeah, suck it up, Ludlow.

810
01:13:36,674 --> 01:13:38,297
Is it gonna rain?

811
01:13:49,549 --> 01:13:51,235
Fuck me!

812
01:13:55,514 --> 01:13:58,576
Of course we get the car
with the retarded wipers.

813
01:13:58,577 --> 01:14:00,997
We could just wait it out.

814
01:14:03,011 --> 01:14:05,081
What are we doing here?

815
01:14:05,986 --> 01:14:07,385
You tell me.

816
01:14:07,386 --> 01:14:09,847
You're the one who said
that we needed to talk,

817
01:14:09,848 --> 01:14:12,658
you stalked me,
you went to my parents house...

818
01:14:12,659 --> 01:14:14,316
What are we doing here?

819
01:14:14,505 --> 01:14:16,168
Just recently,
like an hour ago,

820
01:14:16,169 --> 01:14:18,178
you walked
into my bar and...

821
01:14:18,179 --> 01:14:21,782
you suggested we drive aimlessly
into the perfect fucking storm here.

822
01:14:23,806 --> 01:14:25,450
This is funny.

823
01:14:26,374 --> 01:14:27,811
Yeah.

824
01:14:28,318 --> 01:14:30,983
Yeah,
that's fucking hilarious.

825
01:14:47,998 --> 01:14:50,207
For a while there
I thought we'd actually

826
01:14:50,208 --> 01:14:52,418
pieced together
a pretty decent life.

827
01:14:59,775 --> 01:15:02,835
I have to move everything
out of the apartment next week.

828
01:15:04,792 --> 01:15:07,207
You want me to keep
anything for you?

829
01:15:08,709 --> 01:15:10,963
Where will you move to?

830
01:15:10,964 --> 01:15:12,394
I don't know.

831
01:15:12,907 --> 01:15:15,340
I could stay with my dad
for a little while.

832
01:15:15,341 --> 01:15:18,941
- 'Til I get things figured out.
- How is he?

833
01:15:20,960 --> 01:15:23,843
I'm pretty certain he's losing his mind.

834
01:15:24,929 --> 01:15:26,741
Fernanda left him.

835
01:15:29,505 --> 01:15:31,309
He's getting all talkative...

836
01:15:32,178 --> 01:15:33,799
Waxing philosophical.

837
01:15:33,800 --> 01:15:37,015
Same shit he pulls every time
he's between significant others.

838
01:15:37,664 --> 01:15:39,865
I think it's probably
more than that.

839
01:15:41,963 --> 01:15:43,639
Yes, maybe.

840
01:15:44,627 --> 01:15:47,843
- At least you guys are talking.
- Yeah.

841
01:15:48,870 --> 01:15:51,135
What did tell your parents
about us?

842
01:15:53,374 --> 01:15:55,020
What would I say?

843
01:15:55,640 --> 01:15:57,298
That we're fabulous.

844
01:16:02,359 --> 01:16:06,758
I feel like we're living
some dreadful disaster cliché.

845
01:16:06,759 --> 01:16:08,201
We are.

846
01:16:13,913 --> 01:16:16,538
You're sopping wet.

847
01:16:16,539 --> 01:16:18,937
You noticed! Thank you!

848
01:16:51,645 --> 01:16:53,060
- Wait.
- No, no, no.

849
01:16:53,061 --> 01:16:55,879
No, wait.
Just a second, wait.

850
01:16:56,579 --> 01:16:57,977
Shit.

851
01:17:03,557 --> 01:17:05,626
I slept with someone else.

852
01:17:12,930 --> 01:17:14,562
I'm sorry.

853
01:17:22,114 --> 01:17:23,980
It doesn't matter.

854
01:17:26,049 --> 01:17:28,052
What do you mean
it doesn't matter?

855
01:17:28,520 --> 01:17:30,918
- Get off me.
- Don't...

856
01:17:30,919 --> 01:17:32,926
- El, come on.
- Get off.

857
01:17:34,174 --> 01:17:36,181
What do you mean
it doesn't matter?

858
01:17:36,680 --> 01:17:38,716
Get over yourself, Conor.

859
01:17:42,490 --> 01:17:44,770
- You don't care?
- No.

860
01:17:44,771 --> 01:17:47,200
That's bullshit,
I know you care.

861
01:17:48,704 --> 01:17:50,158
El, you're supposed to say:

862
01:17:50,159 --> 01:17:51,786
"What the fuck
were you thinking, Conor?"

863
01:17:51,787 --> 01:17:53,830
You're supposed to say:
"Your selfish piece of shit."

864
01:17:53,831 --> 01:17:55,266
No.

865
01:17:55,646 --> 01:17:57,466
We're past that.

866
01:17:58,473 --> 01:18:00,686
And you just said it
for me.

867
01:18:00,687 --> 01:18:02,486
Come on,
let's go back to the city.

868
01:18:26,720 --> 01:18:28,396
I'm gonna get out of here.

869
01:19:28,945 --> 01:19:30,980
- Ma'am?
- Yes.

870
01:19:30,981 --> 01:19:32,424
Hi.

871
01:19:32,725 --> 01:19:34,351
What a jerk.

872
01:19:36,855 --> 01:19:38,906
And you look like ass.

873
01:19:39,283 --> 01:19:40,726
Thank you.

874
01:19:41,207 --> 01:19:43,028
Where were you last night?

875
01:19:47,799 --> 01:19:49,830
Do you want
to take a load off?

876
01:19:54,740 --> 01:19:56,598
I come here on breaks.

877
01:19:58,320 --> 01:20:01,417
All the librarians advocate
is a whole nap philosophy.

878
01:20:03,734 --> 01:20:05,760
Nap philosophy?

879
01:20:06,203 --> 01:20:07,652
Yes.

880
01:20:07,653 --> 01:20:11,298
One nap to start the day like...
help with productivity and stuff.

881
01:20:14,432 --> 01:20:18,095
If you wanna read this...

882
01:20:22,416 --> 01:20:23,894
What?

883
01:20:27,359 --> 01:20:29,797
I was hoping
you could read my mind.

884
01:20:31,561 --> 01:20:33,569
Wouldn't that be nice?

885
01:20:44,014 --> 01:20:46,886
You know I did something
stupid this weekend?

886
01:20:49,150 --> 01:20:52,807
Yeah, you're queen
of doing something stupid.

887
01:20:54,148 --> 01:20:55,749
What are you thinking?

888
01:20:56,280 --> 01:20:59,097
Deep end.
Take a train to the city.

889
01:21:00,122 --> 01:21:01,720
Save the world.

890
01:21:02,880 --> 01:21:04,890
When did you become
an idealist?

891
01:21:05,426 --> 01:21:07,073
Couple of seconds ago.

892
01:21:09,630 --> 01:21:12,284
I have a date with the dentist
this weekend.

893
01:21:13,190 --> 01:21:15,416
It's okay, I can be
your third wheel.

894
01:21:24,992 --> 01:21:26,467
- Let's get drinks?
- Yeah.

895
01:21:26,468 --> 01:21:28,255
Yeah, I'll have a drink.

896
01:21:28,256 --> 01:21:30,272
- Should we get...
- A shot.

897
01:21:30,582 --> 01:21:32,812
- Three shots?
- Tequila.

898
01:21:34,142 --> 01:21:35,787
A round of tequila!

899
01:21:53,815 --> 01:21:55,879
I feel old!

900
01:21:55,880 --> 01:21:58,103
- What?
- I feel...

901
01:21:59,072 --> 01:22:00,890
I feel old!

902
01:22:01,490 --> 01:22:03,109
Me too!

903
01:22:05,514 --> 01:22:06,989
Cheers.

904
01:22:38,403 --> 01:22:39,806
What's your name?

905
01:22:41,553 --> 01:22:43,353
I'm good, thanks!

906
01:22:47,305 --> 01:22:48,757
Wait.

907
01:23:22,431 --> 01:23:23,851
Oh my God.

908
01:23:34,506 --> 01:23:37,735
Wait. No, wait!

909
01:23:37,736 --> 01:23:39,135
What?

910
01:23:40,244 --> 01:23:41,703
What is it?

911
01:23:42,977 --> 01:23:44,408
Yeah.

912
01:23:45,016 --> 01:23:46,686
Did I hurt you?

913
01:23:47,032 --> 01:23:48,884
No.

914
01:23:49,950 --> 01:23:51,382
What is it?

915
01:23:52,900 --> 01:23:54,734
You're a stranger.

916
01:23:55,938 --> 01:23:57,340
So are you.

917
01:23:59,220 --> 01:24:01,472
You ever had that moment
when you...

918
01:24:01,824 --> 01:24:04,822
know you're doing something
stupid but you do it anyway?

919
01:24:06,564 --> 01:24:08,390
Yeah, everyday.

920
01:24:08,646 --> 01:24:11,359
- What? Come on.
- No.

921
01:24:11,360 --> 01:24:13,592
- Come on.
- Stay there.

922
01:24:13,593 --> 01:24:16,257
- I'm gonna go.
- No, don't go.

923
01:24:17,583 --> 01:24:19,630
- Don't.
- Jesus.

924
01:24:20,144 --> 01:24:22,149
Just stay for a minute.

925
01:24:23,951 --> 01:24:25,376
Really?

926
01:24:29,213 --> 01:24:30,625
Sorry.

927
01:24:55,458 --> 01:24:56,900
Where to?

928
01:24:59,986 --> 01:25:02,040
Make a loop
around the city.

929
01:25:02,041 --> 01:25:03,666
Got a destination?

930
01:25:04,740 --> 01:25:06,370
Eventually.

931
01:25:26,605 --> 01:25:28,057
Hey, Phoebe.

932
01:25:28,058 --> 01:25:30,863
- Hey, how are you?
- Good.

933
01:25:30,864 --> 01:25:33,274
- Your hair got long.
- Not really.

934
01:25:34,322 --> 01:25:35,752
He's in his spot.

935
01:25:43,530 --> 01:25:44,987
That's good.

936
01:25:57,780 --> 01:26:01,002
You could make this place
your own if you want.

937
01:26:02,135 --> 01:26:05,194
- And do what you like with it.
- Seriously, like...

938
01:26:06,768 --> 01:26:08,251
I'm done.

939
01:26:09,366 --> 01:26:12,833
Used to be pretty cool
once upon a time.

940
01:26:13,381 --> 01:26:15,585
Some of the same faces
still show up.

941
01:26:15,586 --> 01:26:18,914
Except more wrinkled.
Some are less, though.

942
01:26:19,871 --> 01:26:23,332
Stones went last week
after playing the Garden, but...

943
01:26:24,504 --> 01:26:27,567
mostly, people are
just fading away.

944
01:26:30,097 --> 01:26:32,759
I've been doing this
way too long.

945
01:26:32,890 --> 01:26:34,890
I think you've done
pretty good.

946
01:26:35,938 --> 01:26:40,967
Yeah, well... Complacency
scares the shit out of me.

947
01:26:41,691 --> 01:26:43,121
Yeah?

948
01:26:44,284 --> 01:26:48,531
And how is this: I forfeited
the loan the bank gave me,

949
01:26:48,532 --> 01:26:51,008
I'm losing
the lease of my bar,

950
01:26:51,009 --> 01:26:53,057
Eleanor's gone...

951
01:26:53,675 --> 01:26:55,682
with the fucking wind.

952
01:26:56,938 --> 01:26:59,385
I'm 33 years old,

953
01:27:00,098 --> 01:27:02,782
and my life is
a fucking boat-wreck.

954
01:27:05,298 --> 01:27:07,373
I'm on my sixties,

955
01:27:07,659 --> 01:27:09,695
I lost a grandson
this year,

956
01:27:09,696 --> 01:27:12,533
but I'm basically
forbidden to talk about,

957
01:27:12,534 --> 01:27:15,191
my third wife
just walked out of me,

958
01:27:15,192 --> 01:27:16,997
and I come here
every afternoon

959
01:27:16,998 --> 01:27:19,847
to this restaurant named
after your mother.

960
01:27:24,661 --> 01:27:28,285
- It's time to shoot the crow.
- Where you're gonna go?

961
01:27:28,286 --> 01:27:30,507
Youre gonna fly off
to Never Never Land?

962
01:27:31,237 --> 01:27:32,848
Become a Buddhist?

963
01:27:34,079 --> 01:27:36,119
What are you doing here,
anyway?

964
01:27:36,571 --> 01:27:39,842
I was just
in the neighborhood.

965
01:27:43,224 --> 01:27:45,655
"Just in the neighborhood."

966
01:27:47,899 --> 01:27:49,537
What is it?

967
01:27:54,237 --> 01:27:58,848
Do you ever wonder why
we fall in love with a specific person?

968
01:28:00,732 --> 01:28:02,163
Not really.

969
01:28:03,204 --> 01:28:05,003
I think to myself:

970
01:28:05,422 --> 01:28:10,055
"Somethings wrong here, but I cant
quite put my finger on what it is."

971
01:28:12,659 --> 01:28:15,929
There's always one
that haunts us.

972
01:28:17,124 --> 01:28:18,731
So give her time.

973
01:28:21,994 --> 01:28:25,434
It's the right thing to do
given the circumstances.

974
01:28:27,839 --> 01:28:30,837
- Circumstances suck.
- Yeah.

975
01:28:37,364 --> 01:28:40,168
I really forbid you
from talking about him?

976
01:28:46,469 --> 01:28:49,131
What the fuck
are you gonna say to me?

977
01:28:56,830 --> 01:28:58,847
Ever since he...

978
01:29:02,722 --> 01:29:04,936
Ever since what happened
happened,

979
01:29:04,937 --> 01:29:07,558
any thought or memory of him
has been something

980
01:29:07,559 --> 01:29:11,237
just to run my mind as far
as fuck away from as I can get...

981
01:29:11,792 --> 01:29:13,209
And that...

982
01:29:21,773 --> 01:29:24,983
A shooting star
only lasts a second.

983
01:29:27,107 --> 01:29:28,732
But...

984
01:29:28,733 --> 01:29:32,543
Aren't you glad that you
at least have seen it?

985
01:29:39,335 --> 01:29:40,985
That's nice.

986
01:29:45,070 --> 01:29:47,473
It's a little Hallmark,
but it's nice.

987
01:29:48,651 --> 01:29:50,675
I mean, it is nice.

988
01:29:51,545 --> 01:29:53,375
You have
a delicate soul, dad.

989
01:29:53,376 --> 01:29:55,824
Nobody's ever said
that to me before.

990
01:29:56,236 --> 01:29:58,672
You know you are
in imminent danger of sappiness?

991
01:29:58,673 --> 01:30:01,292
We can't have that, can we?

992
01:30:03,191 --> 01:30:05,389
- Are you hungry?
- Yes.

993
01:30:05,390 --> 01:30:07,639
- I'll fix you something up.
- Okay.

994
01:30:25,753 --> 01:30:29,950
All the lonely people...
Where do they all come from?

995
01:30:31,304 --> 01:30:33,747
This is the Beatles' song
you were named after.

996
01:30:35,104 --> 01:30:36,721
Three Splendas?

997
01:30:37,121 --> 01:30:39,139
Full service.

998
01:30:40,912 --> 01:30:43,934
Want me to come down there
or you wanna join me in here?

999
01:30:53,549 --> 01:30:55,800
I think I'm gonna leave
your class.

1000
01:31:05,473 --> 01:31:07,919
You're breaking up with me.

1001
01:31:13,391 --> 01:31:16,665
So this is what
heartbreak feels like.

1002
01:31:17,066 --> 01:31:19,127
You never had
your heart broken?

1003
01:31:19,128 --> 01:31:21,580
Only read about it
in books.

1004
01:31:22,140 --> 01:31:25,602
- Liar.
- Sure.

1005
01:31:32,352 --> 01:31:36,797
You don't have to tell me this,
you could have just not shown up.

1006
01:31:44,786 --> 01:31:46,789
I just gotta get out
of here.

1007
01:31:48,324 --> 01:31:49,750
Here?

1008
01:31:50,597 --> 01:31:53,024
The Tri-State Area.

1009
01:31:54,588 --> 01:31:57,449
You know they say
that if you...

1010
01:31:57,450 --> 01:32:00,682
walk away from things
then you will just...

1011
01:32:01,032 --> 01:32:03,651
keep walking away and...

1012
01:32:03,652 --> 01:32:07,657
start a whole history
of walkaways.

1013
01:32:11,743 --> 01:32:15,989
Did this sound as lame
as I thought it did?

1014
01:32:16,412 --> 01:32:18,056
No.

1015
01:32:18,451 --> 01:32:20,105
Good, 'cause I don't have
a fucking clue

1016
01:32:20,106 --> 01:32:22,311
of how life should
be lived.

1017
01:32:22,312 --> 01:32:25,536
Well, could you refer me
to someone who does, please?

1018
01:32:29,479 --> 01:32:30,933
Yeah.

1019
01:32:31,624 --> 01:32:36,401
I had a dog, Miles.
Got him from a pound.

1020
01:32:36,402 --> 01:32:41,266
He did pretty well and lived
every day like he won the lottery.

1021
01:32:41,267 --> 01:32:43,136
Where's Miles
when we need him?

1022
01:32:43,137 --> 01:32:45,208
Somewhere in Pennsylvania.

1023
01:32:45,803 --> 01:32:49,625
Took him on a road trip,
trying to be all travels with Charlie.

1024
01:32:50,219 --> 01:32:52,231
As soon as we hit
the open countryside,

1025
01:32:52,232 --> 01:32:55,047
he started jumping up and down
like he picked up a scent

1026
01:32:55,048 --> 01:32:58,649
or found something
he'd always been looking for.

1027
01:32:59,715 --> 01:33:01,358
We let him out...

1028
01:33:02,095 --> 01:33:06,372
He hightails it,
chasing the sun in nowhere.

1029
01:33:08,257 --> 01:33:09,918
He ran away?

1030
01:33:11,016 --> 01:33:13,817
I imagine he's happy
wherever he wind up.

1031
01:33:13,818 --> 01:33:15,819
Hooked up
with some Amish people.

1032
01:33:15,820 --> 01:33:19,042
- Lives on a diary farm.
- It's possible.

1033
01:33:26,004 --> 01:33:28,873
I have a colleague at NYU.

1034
01:33:29,729 --> 01:33:33,147
It's from my days I've worked
with your dad there.

1035
01:33:33,518 --> 01:33:36,796
Teaches Anthropology
at American University in Paris,

1036
01:33:36,797 --> 01:33:40,064
does some work
at the Musée du quai Branly.

1037
01:33:41,204 --> 01:33:43,074
I make a phone call...

1038
01:33:43,839 --> 01:33:46,690
send him that dissertation
you started on...

1039
01:33:52,400 --> 01:33:54,456
Want half a bagel?

1040
01:33:54,457 --> 01:33:57,890
- No, I'm good, I'm good.
- You're getting enough to eat?

1041
01:33:57,891 --> 01:34:00,119
You're starting
to sound maternal.

1042
01:34:00,120 --> 01:34:01,941
That would be a first.

1043
01:34:04,585 --> 01:34:07,204
When's the last time
you got to talk to your son?

1044
01:34:09,156 --> 01:34:11,798
Some holiday too long ago.

1045
01:34:12,934 --> 01:34:14,980
Is it sad
that I don't remember?

1046
01:34:14,981 --> 01:34:16,379
Probably.

1047
01:34:17,863 --> 01:34:20,290
I should call him,
shouldn't I?

1048
01:34:21,677 --> 01:34:23,091
Yes.

1049
01:34:26,733 --> 01:34:29,175
Now you sound maternal.

1050
01:35:47,011 --> 01:35:48,451
Hello?

1051
01:35:49,712 --> 01:35:51,117
Hello?

1052
01:35:53,348 --> 01:35:54,771
<i>Hello?</i>

1053
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:47,805
<i>With your kiss
my life begins</i>

1054
01:37:53,508 --> 01:37:56,707
<i>And like the leaf clings</i>

1055
01:37:57,112 --> 01:38:01,332
<i>to the tree</i>

1056
01:38:06,223 --> 01:38:11,694
<i>Baby, please, cling to me</i>

1057
01:38:18,392 --> 01:38:21,800
<i>We are creatures</i>

1058
01:38:21,801 --> 01:38:25,040
<i>of the wind</i>

1059
01:38:27,202 --> 01:38:32,836
<i>Wild is the wind</i>

1060
01:38:37,319 --> 01:38:43,127
<i>You touch me</i>

1061
01:38:45,698 --> 01:38:49,139
<i>I hear the sound
of mandolins</i>

1062
01:38:49,140 --> 01:38:54,944
<i>And you kiss me</i>

1063
01:38:58,173 --> 01:39:03,169
<i>With your kiss
my life begins</i>

1064
01:39:21,338 --> 01:39:24,580
<i>Love me, love me</i>

1065
01:39:25,043 --> 01:39:28,645
<i>Say you do</i>

1066
01:39:32,875 --> 01:39:38,310
<i>Let me fly away with you</i>

1067
01:41:57,450 --> 01:41:58,900
Hey.

1068
01:42:05,088 --> 01:42:07,732
Do I seem like
a different person to you?

1069
01:42:12,033 --> 01:42:14,264
You look the same to me.

1070
01:42:21,493 --> 01:42:23,510
I'm sorry.

1071
01:42:26,343 --> 01:42:28,200
For what?

1072
01:42:30,960 --> 01:42:33,016
For disappearing.

1073
01:42:49,911 --> 01:42:52,768
We'll never get
to where we were.

1074
01:42:56,309 --> 01:42:58,185
Where was that?

1075
01:43:05,658 --> 01:43:08,059
Someplace good.

1076
01:43:09,884 --> 01:43:11,366
Yeah.

1077
01:43:18,681 --> 01:43:20,905
Tell me what are
you thinking.

1078
01:43:32,830 --> 01:43:35,486
I forgot
what he looked like.

1079
01:43:42,183 --> 01:43:46,421
Sometimes I'll get a glimpse
of his eyes or...

1080
01:43:52,730 --> 01:43:55,994
the way he'd smile at me
from his crib.

1081
01:44:01,938 --> 01:44:04,196
But then it will vanish.

1082
01:44:06,422 --> 01:44:09,029
I can't picture his face.

1083
01:44:11,446 --> 01:44:14,071
I can't picture
his face anymore.

1084
01:44:28,167 --> 01:44:30,174
He was pale.

1085
01:44:36,389 --> 01:44:38,600
He frowned a lot.

1086
01:44:39,338 --> 01:44:42,364
He had your eyes,
he had your nose,

1087
01:44:42,365 --> 01:44:46,972
he had your lips
he had your cheeks.

1088
01:44:46,973 --> 01:44:49,415
El, he was all you.

1089
01:44:52,861 --> 01:44:56,721
He was the most beautiful thing
I've ever seen.

1090
01:45:11,615 --> 01:45:14,819
I wasn't prepared
for what this feels like.

1091
01:45:18,278 --> 01:45:21,078
I know, neither was I.

1092
01:46:16,731 --> 01:46:18,751
I love you.

1093
01:46:22,971 --> 01:46:24,972
I know.

1094
01:47:06,200 --> 01:47:09,044
- How's it coming?
- It's coming.

1095
01:47:11,522 --> 01:47:15,764
There was a great cafe,
called "Le Cafe",

1096
01:47:15,765 --> 01:47:18,566
at the Rue Tiquetonne,

1097
01:47:18,968 --> 01:47:21,372
then a lot of artsy fartsys
to go too,

1098
01:47:21,373 --> 01:47:24,018
your mother and I used to go there
when we visited her parents.

1099
01:47:24,019 --> 01:47:26,020
We met Jean-Marie Le Clézio
there once.

1100
01:47:26,021 --> 01:47:29,836
- Before he won his Nobel.
- Cool.

1101
01:47:30,335 --> 01:47:33,172
And you should get...

1102
01:47:33,177 --> 01:47:35,234
some of those
big french macarons,

1103
01:47:35,235 --> 01:47:39,082
at Ladurée...

1104
01:47:39,744 --> 01:47:41,979
in Saint Germain.

1105
01:47:44,097 --> 01:47:45,958
Call me when you do...

1106
01:47:48,746 --> 01:47:51,575
and I will live
vicariously through you.

1107
01:47:52,210 --> 01:47:54,076
I will, thanks.

1108
01:48:04,307 --> 01:48:07,145
I lost you
in the ocean once.

1109
01:48:07,707 --> 01:48:09,144
What?

1110
01:48:13,097 --> 01:48:15,324
I lost you
in the ocean once.

1111
01:48:17,896 --> 01:48:19,752
We had rented a house,

1112
01:48:19,753 --> 01:48:23,367
in the Ditch Plains Beach,
on Montauk.

1113
01:48:23,791 --> 01:48:26,252
We only could afford
Montauk.

1114
01:48:26,849 --> 01:48:28,686
You were about 2.

1115
01:48:29,820 --> 01:48:32,496
Your mother was pregnant
with Katy.

1116
01:48:32,790 --> 01:48:35,222
And I took you down,

1117
01:48:35,626 --> 01:48:39,241
swimming, one afternoon.

1118
01:48:40,805 --> 01:48:43,030
And a lot of people
down there...

1119
01:48:44,682 --> 01:48:46,166
I...

1120
01:48:48,505 --> 01:48:50,587
I waited out...

1121
01:48:51,217 --> 01:48:53,077
holding you.

1122
01:48:54,471 --> 01:48:57,911
Thinking at one point:
"This might not be the best idea."

1123
01:49:00,545 --> 01:49:02,576
But you were game.

1124
01:49:05,312 --> 01:49:06,934
Or I imagined
that you were game

1125
01:49:06,935 --> 01:49:09,579
because you never ever
seemed scared.

1126
01:49:11,393 --> 01:49:13,043
About anything.

1127
01:49:14,803 --> 01:49:17,003
The Atlantic is moody,

1128
01:49:17,004 --> 01:49:20,201
and a big set of waves
knocked in.

1129
01:49:20,643 --> 01:49:24,847
We made it
under the first one.

1130
01:49:26,699 --> 01:49:28,935
You were clinging
to my neck.

1131
01:49:29,946 --> 01:49:32,820
But we got caught
in front of the second...

1132
01:49:36,131 --> 01:49:38,559
and I came up without you.

1133
01:49:40,948 --> 01:49:45,575
And I have never felt
anything like that.

1134
01:49:47,708 --> 01:49:51,935
The throes of stupid
couple seconds...

1135
01:49:52,687 --> 01:49:55,121
treading the white water.

1136
01:49:58,949 --> 01:50:02,780
And then miraculously I...

1137
01:50:05,177 --> 01:50:07,608
felt you at my feet.

1138
01:50:10,413 --> 01:50:14,268
I never told your mother.
I never told anyone.

1139
01:50:15,652 --> 01:50:19,449
It was the worst
and best moment of my life.

1140
01:50:39,891 --> 01:50:41,507
Can I...

1141
01:50:43,070 --> 01:50:45,273
- Is this ready?
- Yes.

1142
01:50:47,034 --> 01:50:49,848
- I'll be downstairs in a bit.
- Okay.

1143
01:51:53,126 --> 01:51:54,537
What you got?

1144
01:51:55,304 --> 01:51:56,925
Chardonnay.

1145
01:52:01,917 --> 01:52:03,789
It's good, huh?

1146
01:52:07,682 --> 01:52:10,339
You know I am
full of shit, right?

1147
01:52:10,340 --> 01:52:12,005
Depends on the day.

1148
01:52:13,893 --> 01:52:16,744
But you know
that I love you, huh?

1149
01:52:23,697 --> 01:52:25,941
Say goodbye
to auntie El, okay?

1150
01:52:26,500 --> 01:52:29,134
Okay.
Goodbye, chickadee.

1151
01:52:29,135 --> 01:52:30,992
You make sure
that they behave, okay?

1152
01:52:30,993 --> 01:52:32,804
- Okay.
- Okay, kiss.

1153
01:52:35,640 --> 01:52:37,638
What time is it in France?

1154
01:52:38,327 --> 01:52:41,152
- It is past your bedtime.
- Why?

1155
01:52:45,750 --> 01:52:47,373
Don't be a stranger.

1156
01:52:49,315 --> 01:52:50,738
I won't.

1157
01:52:52,169 --> 01:52:55,182
I don't wanna go to bed.
There's still light out.

1158
01:52:55,400 --> 01:52:57,477
You don't have to go
to bed, sweetie.

1159
01:52:57,478 --> 01:52:59,105
Be good, okay?
I'll be back.

1160
01:52:59,106 --> 01:53:01,123
When is auntie El
coming back?

1161
01:53:01,124 --> 01:53:02,761
She'll be back next summer.

1162
01:53:47,728 --> 01:53:49,171
Hey, guys.

1163
01:53:49,565 --> 01:53:51,811
Gonna go take a stroll
before the rush, okay?

1164
01:53:51,812 --> 01:53:53,212
Okay.

1165
01:53:54,935 --> 01:53:56,776
Aren't you worried
about these 15 people

1166
01:53:56,777 --> 01:53:58,603
as to how we can deal
with them?

1167
01:53:58,604 --> 01:54:01,075
You know how we do this?
We could use the back room.

1168
01:54:02,917 --> 01:54:05,931
<i>If every dream</i>

1169
01:54:07,102 --> 01:54:10,752
<i>Are ways to be</i>

1170
01:54:13,651 --> 01:54:17,092
<i>A way to you</i>

1171
01:54:28,890 --> 01:54:31,559
<i>If every clock</i>

1172
01:54:32,936 --> 01:54:36,387
<i>Turns back to me</i>

1173
01:54:39,362 --> 01:54:42,826
<i>Turn back to you</i>

1174
01:54:50,506 --> 01:54:52,550
<i>Still</i>

1175
01:54:53,586 --> 01:54:57,401
<i>No fate awaits</i>

1176
01:55:03,546 --> 01:55:06,620
<i>Still, without you</i>

1177
01:55:06,621 --> 01:55:10,080
<i>No fate awaits</i>

1178
01:55:10,081 --> 01:55:15,889
<i>Still, no fate awaits me</i>

1179
01:55:46,650 --> 01:55:49,490
<i>If every road</i>

1180
01:55:50,584 --> 01:55:54,414
<i>Comes back to me</i>

1181
01:55:57,179 --> 01:56:00,977
<i>Come back to you</i>

1182
01:56:12,444 --> 01:56:15,270
<i>If every road</i>

1183
01:56:16,508 --> 01:56:20,129
<i>Comes back to you</i>

1184
01:56:23,000 --> 01:56:26,593
<i>Come back to me</i>
