Cincinnati.

177
00:18:47,677 --> 00:18:51,182
I grew up in Cincinnati.
I was born in Iran.

178
00:18:51,215 --> 00:18:55,186
- Iran.
- Used to be Persia.

179
00:18:55,219 --> 00:18:57,420
Yeah. [chuckles]

180
00:18:57,454 --> 00:18:59,824
Now they got Arabs
questioning Americans.

181
00:18:59,857 --> 00:19:01,725
[laughing]

182
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:04,829
She's expecting you.

183
00:19:07,031 --> 00:19:09,733
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

184
00:19:12,636 --> 00:19:14,906
We sure are in a pickle,
aren't we?

185
00:19:14,939 --> 00:19:17,174
[man]
Yeah, we are in a pickle.

186
00:19:18,809 --> 00:19:19,877
Hello?

187
00:19:20,845 --> 00:19:23,613
[radio sounding]

188
00:19:29,653 --> 00:19:31,454
Hello?

189
00:19:31,488 --> 00:19:35,226
Please make yourself at home.
I'll be with you in a minute.

190
00:19:35,259 --> 00:19:37,228
The boys need their dinner.

191
00:19:37,261 --> 00:19:38,695
- Yeah, of course.
- Yeah.

192
00:19:38,728 --> 00:19:40,463
Take your time.

193
00:19:44,668 --> 00:19:45,803
[clock ticking]

194
00:19:57,949 --> 00:19:59,116

195

[footsteps approaching]

196
00:20:07,191 --> 00:20:08,893
Oh!

197
00:20:08,926 --> 00:20:10,795
You have a beautiful family.

198
00:20:10,828 --> 00:20:14,631
Well, they're all scattered now.

199
00:20:14,664 --> 00:20:20,704
Five kids and... [chuckles] eleven
grandchildren. It's hard to believe.

200
00:20:20,737 --> 00:20:22,706
They all live
their own lives now.

201
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:25,076
Come on. Sit.

202
00:20:26,811 --> 00:20:32,016
My husband and I filled out
the census a while ago.

203
00:20:32,049 --> 00:20:35,618
And then your office called
saying there was...

204
00:20:35,652 --> 00:20:40,590
there's another question
that they needed an interview?

205
00:20:40,623 --> 00:20:44,095
Yes. We're collecting
people's dreams.

206
00:20:48,332 --> 00:20:49,699
[grunts]

207
00:20:50,768 --> 00:20:53,104
Well, why?

208
00:20:53,137 --> 00:20:57,141
It's for your security.
I'm just doing my job.

209
00:20:58,275 --> 00:20:59,743
So...

210
00:21:00,845 --> 00:21:02,113
[recorder beeps]

211
00:21:02,146 --> 00:21:04,248
Can you recall your last dream?

212
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:07,717
Uh...

213
00:21:09,954 --> 00:21:16,994
[chuckles] As a matter of fact, not
long ago I did have this dream. This...

214
00:21:20,031 --> 00:21:21,232
bizarre dream.

215
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,770
I was sitting here
in the living room.

216
00:21:25,803 --> 00:21:28,806
And I heard this
very loud noise.

217
00:21:35,312 --> 00:21:37,680
And then I walked to the window.

218
00:21:41,886 --> 00:21:43,287
And there's...

219
00:21:46,090 --> 00:21:48,691
all of these people...

220
00:21:50,727 --> 00:21:52,629
out in my yard.

221
00:21:54,765 --> 00:21:56,133
Strangers.

222
00:21:58,402 --> 00:22:00,637
Very loud.

223
00:22:04,641 --> 00:22:08,578
They're shouting...

224
00:22:09,814 --> 00:22:11,215
laughing...

225
00:22:12,682 --> 00:22:13,851
singing.

226
00:22:13,884 --> 00:22:16,586
[mariachi music plays
from a distance]

227
00:22:18,789 --> 00:22:20,925
Speaking their language.

228
00:22:26,764 --> 00:22:30,868
I'm... I'm scared.

229
00:22:36,907 --> 00:22:38,776
Turned away from the window...

230
00:22:42,079 --> 00:22:44,747
and there they are
inside my house.

231
00:22:48,219 --> 00:22:51,721
In my living room.

232
00:22:51,755 --> 00:22:53,623
[music continues]

233
00:23:03,267 --> 00:23:05,402
[Jackie]
They're everywhere.

234
00:23:05,436 --> 00:23:08,705
[muffled whistles and singing]

235
00:23:13,210 --> 00:23:14,845
Men...

236
00:23:14,879 --> 00:23:16,080
women.

237
00:23:17,114 --> 00:23:18,949
And they don't see me.

238
00:23:22,186 --> 00:23:24,421
It's as if I don't exist!

239
00:23:36,267 --> 00:23:40,771
I keep looking for my husband.
But...

240
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:45,776
Oh, Mark.
I didn't know you were here.

241
00:23:45,809 --> 00:23:47,144
I wasn't.

242
00:23:47,178 --> 00:23:49,313
This is Mark, my nephew.

243
00:23:49,346 --> 00:23:52,049
Speaking of dreams,
I believe he lives in one.

244
00:23:53,250 --> 00:23:55,853
- It's nice to meet you.
- Yeah, you too.

245
00:23:55,886 --> 00:23:58,155
Please continue with your dream.

246
00:23:59,390 --> 00:24:01,258
Oh, um...

247
00:24:06,430 --> 00:24:09,300
No. That's all I remember.

248
00:24:10,334 --> 00:24:13,204
Okay. Thank you.

249
00:24:13,237 --> 00:24:18,275
So, you're one of the new
dream catchers for the Census?

250
00:24:18,309 --> 00:24:22,012
- Do you want to tell me your last dream?
- No, I can't do that.

251
00:24:22,546 --> 00:24:23,981
Um...

252
00:24:24,014 --> 00:24:25,849
Can I ask why?

253
00:24:26,550 --> 00:24:28,085
I don't share them.

254
00:24:29,353 --> 00:24:32,122
I don't share mine either.

255
00:24:32,156 --> 00:24:34,058
It was a real pleasure
to meet you.

256
00:24:34,091 --> 00:24:37,761
Oh. It's our duty
to be good Americans.

257
00:24:37,795 --> 00:24:39,997
- Good citizens.
- Right.

258
00:24:42,132 --> 00:24:44,034
Well, thank you, again.

259
00:24:49,373 --> 00:24:50,407
[car door thumps]

260
00:24:55,479 --> 00:24:56,880
[tapping]

261
00:24:59,583 --> 00:25:05,389
Hey, I'm sorry to bother you, but
you're not going downtown, are you?

262
00:25:05,422 --> 00:25:08,192
- It's on my way.
- You mind dropping me off?

263
00:25:10,494 --> 00:25:13,831
- Sure, why not?
- Great. I appreciate it.

264
00:25:18,269 --> 00:25:19,503
[car engine starts]

265
00:25:26,210 --> 00:25:29,813

266

[sniffs]

267
00:25:53,404 --> 00:25:58,442
These recordings are dreams.
Will they be open to the public?

268
00:25:59,410 --> 00:26:01,979
They should be.

269
00:26:02,012 --> 00:26:05,215
I think they should be available
for scientists.

270
00:26:05,249 --> 00:26:07,418
- Right.
- And psychologists.

271
00:26:09,019 --> 00:26:10,521
Maybe even artists.

272
00:26:13,057 --> 00:26:17,094
- What about priests?
- No. Priests?

273
00:26:17,127 --> 00:26:18,329
- Okay.
- I don't know.

274
00:26:18,362 --> 00:26:21,231
Priests are only after
sins and confessions.

275
00:26:21,265 --> 00:26:23,567
They don't have any use
for dreams.

276
00:26:25,936 --> 00:26:30,474
All dreams are kind of innocent,
I suppose.

277
00:26:32,409 --> 00:26:37,181
Yeah. How can you commit
a crime in a dream?

278
00:26:45,089 --> 00:26:48,392
- Anyway, most people forget their dreams.
- That's true.

279
00:26:48,425 --> 00:26:52,663
- Because they vanish, in a moment.
- Yep.

280
00:26:52,696 --> 00:26:56,100
If you don't remember your dream
right away, it's not a dream anymore.

281
00:26:56,133 --> 00:26:57,301
What is it then?

282
00:27:00,938 --> 00:27:02,139
It's a story.

283
00:27:06,410 --> 00:27:09,413
A story.
[whispers] A story.

284
00:27:14,585 --> 00:27:18,389
- [Simin] Well, here we are.
- [Mark] Thanks for the ride.

285
00:27:18,422 --> 00:27:21,392
- My pleasure.
- [music fades]

286
00:27:21,425 --> 00:27:26,430
- You have time for a drink?
- I have too much work to do.

287
00:27:26,463 --> 00:27:31,935
- Some other time then.
- Maybe. Sure.

288
00:27:31,969 --> 00:27:35,439
- I'll see you around.
- Yes, you will.

289
00:27:37,408 --> 00:27:42,079
Hey, before you go,
just tell me one thing.

290
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:44,948
How were you selected?

291
00:27:46,116 --> 00:27:48,619
- I can't tell you.
- Why?

292
00:27:49,987 --> 00:27:51,455
Because they don't tell us.

293
00:27:52,689 --> 00:27:54,091
Oh...

294
00:27:55,426 --> 00:27:56,460
Okay.

295
00:27:58,429 --> 00:28:00,664
- Hey, Mark.
- Yeah.

296
00:28:00,697 --> 00:28:03,567
- That's your name, right?
- Yeah.

297
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:06,603
What's the real reason
you didn't tell me your dream?

298
00:28:09,573 --> 00:28:10,974
Because I love you.

299
00:28:13,544 --> 00:28:14,678
[door thumps]

300
00:28:17,614 --> 00:28:19,049
[chuckles]

301
00:29:00,390 --> 00:29:03,494
[man] All right.
First day of school.

302
00:29:03,527 --> 00:29:08,499
Teacher says, "Let's start off
with a review of American history.

303
00:29:08,532 --> 00:29:11,735
Who said 'Give me Liberty,
or give me Death'?"

304
00:29:11,769 --> 00:29:16,340
And the teacher looks out
at a sea of blank faces,

305
00:29:16,373 --> 00:29:18,342
except young Pedro's
who's got his hand up

306
00:29:18,375 --> 00:29:22,212
and he says,
"Patrick Henry, 1775."

307
00:29:22,246 --> 00:29:26,617
And the teacher says, "That's
wonderful. That's wonderful, Pedro.

308
00:29:26,650 --> 00:29:30,822
Who said, 'A government
of the people, by the people,

309
00:29:30,855 --> 00:29:34,291
for the people, shall
never perish on this earth'?"

310
00:29:34,324 --> 00:29:39,129
Again, there's no response,

311
00:29:39,162 --> 00:29:42,232
except from little Pedro,
he's got his hand up.

312
00:29:42,266 --> 00:29:44,769
"Abraham Lincoln, 1863."

313
00:29:44,802 --> 00:29:46,236
[thumps]

314
00:29:46,270 --> 00:29:48,305
The teacher snaps
at the class and says,

315
00:29:48,338 --> 00:29:50,707
"Class, come on now, you ought
to be ashamed of yourself.

316
00:29:50,741 --> 00:29:53,076
Here's Pedro,
he's new to this country

317
00:29:53,110 --> 00:29:55,746
and he knows more about
our history than you do."

318
00:29:55,780 --> 00:29:59,149
And just now, another kid from
the back of the class yells out,

319
00:29:59,182 --> 00:30:01,618
"Fuck the Mexicans." The
teacher says, "Who said that?"

320
00:30:01,652 --> 00:30:06,423
Pedro without missing
a beat says, "Jim Bowie, 1836."

321
00:30:06,456 --> 00:30:09,159
Now another kid yells out
from the back of the class,

322
00:30:09,192 --> 00:30:11,461
"I think I'm gonna puke."
Now the teacher's pissed off.

323
00:30:11,495 --> 00:30:13,497
She says, "All right,
who said that?"

324
00:30:13,530 --> 00:30:15,365
Again, Pedro,

325
00:30:15,399 --> 00:30:18,502
"George Bush to the Japanese
Prime Minister, 1991."

326
00:30:18,535 --> 00:30:21,405
Now, another kid furious says,
"Yeah! Suck on this!"

327
00:30:21,438 --> 00:30:23,140
Pedro jumps out of his chair

328
00:30:23,173 --> 00:30:26,610
and says, "Bill Clinton
to Monica Lewinsky, 1997!"

329
00:30:26,643 --> 00:30:29,546
The class is in hysterics,
the teacher passes out,

330
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:32,482
the students gather around
and one of them says,

331
00:30:32,516 --> 00:30:36,320
"Oh shit,
we're in big trouble now."

332
00:30:38,188 --> 00:30:42,626
Pedro whispers:
"Donald Trump, 2020."

333
00:30:42,659 --> 00:30:44,428
[muffled laugh]

334
00:30:48,632 --> 00:30:50,400

00:32:18,455 --> 00:32:20,390
When did they do that?

351
00:32:20,424 --> 00:32:22,325
- I think it was Tuesday.
- No way.

352
00:32:23,427 --> 00:32:25,195
[whirring]

353
00:32:26,296 --> 00:32:27,965
[beeping]

354
00:32:32,970 --> 00:32:35,439
[woman]
<i>I'm asking for my direction.</i>

355
00:32:35,472 --> 00:32:38,308
<i>I'm asking people,
"Do you know where is my house?</i>

356
00:32:38,341 --> 00:32:39,944
<i>The house I was born in?"</i>

357
00:32:41,344 --> 00:32:43,346
<i>And nobody knows.</i>

358
00:32:44,748 --> 00:32:49,386
<i>And I'm so desperate,
I pray to the Lord.</i>

359
00:32:49,419 --> 00:32:51,555
Good morning.
How are you, Simin?

360
00:32:53,390 --> 00:32:54,859
Okay, I guess.

361
00:32:54,892 --> 00:32:58,261
Nancy would like to see you.
She said it's urgent.

362
00:33:00,630 --> 00:33:01,665
Okay.

363
00:33:12,509 --> 00:33:14,054
[Nancy] There's feedback
from Washington,

364
00:33:14,078 --> 00:33:17,048
specifically from Barbara.
So top priority.

365
00:33:17,081 --> 00:33:19,951
Extra attention needs to be
placed on certain key phrases.

366
00:33:19,984 --> 00:33:22,352
- I want you to...
- [knocking]

367
00:33:22,385 --> 00:33:24,521
[Nancy]
Ah! Come in.

368
00:33:24,554 --> 00:33:27,691
Are you sure? Okay.

369
00:33:27,724 --> 00:33:31,996
I need you to bring up
file number 32AZ58B.

370
00:33:32,029 --> 00:33:35,298
See Tylor ASAP
for the details. Okay?

371
00:33:35,332 --> 00:33:37,367
[phone beeps]

372
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:41,038
Well, it's wonderful to see you,
Simin. Simin Jaan.

373
00:33:41,072 --> 00:33:43,607
You know what?

374
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:47,544
I don't think you ever told me
what "Jaan" means in Farsi.

375
00:33:47,577 --> 00:33:51,816
Soul. I guess. I mean,
that's the literal meaning.

376
00:33:51,849 --> 00:33:55,318
- Uh-huh.
- But it's more like "Dear."

377
00:33:55,352 --> 00:33:56,954
Like Nancy, dear.

378
00:33:56,988 --> 00:33:59,991
Soul. I love that.

379
00:34:01,491 --> 00:34:05,062
Please, take a seat.
Make yourself comfortable.

380
00:34:05,096 --> 00:34:10,600
You know, Simin, you have been
doing an excellent job for us.

381
00:34:10,634 --> 00:34:12,937
Everyone is very happy.

382
00:34:12,970 --> 00:34:19,509
Now, today, I have a very
special assignment for you.

383
00:34:19,543 --> 00:34:22,712
I want you to take
a quick look at this.

384
00:34:29,153 --> 00:34:34,591
This is a very special and
difficult assignment, frankly.

385
00:34:34,624 --> 00:34:38,662
Other census workers,
senior to you, I may add,

386
00:34:38,695 --> 00:34:40,363
have contacted these people

387
00:34:40,397 --> 00:34:42,900
but have been
entirely unsuccessful

388
00:34:42,934 --> 00:34:46,369
in gathering the data
we need from them.

389
00:34:46,403 --> 00:34:48,638
That's why I believe
it's a job for you.

390
00:34:51,474 --> 00:34:53,410
Give me one second, Simin.

391
00:34:56,446 --> 00:34:57,949
- Brian.
- <i>Yes, ma'am.</i>

392
00:34:57,982 --> 00:35:02,019
[Nancy] I need you to pull up
file number 32AZ58B.

393
00:35:03,754 --> 00:35:07,058
- <i>Apparently it was deleted.</i>
- Um... Are you sure?

394
00:35:07,091 --> 00:35:10,427
<i>I'm certain.
Look for yourself.</i>

395
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:12,163
- [beeping]
- Ah!

396
00:35:12,196 --> 00:35:14,397
Well, you're right.

397
00:35:14,431 --> 00:35:16,700
[claps] - Thank
you very much, Brian.

398
00:35:18,735 --> 00:35:20,604
Sorry about that.

399
00:35:20,637 --> 00:35:24,574
Now the community
you visit today,

400
00:35:24,608 --> 00:35:27,011
they have not been cooperating.

401
00:35:27,044 --> 00:35:32,682
They simply refuse to supply any
of the data we need.

402
00:35:32,716 --> 00:35:39,589
Simin, if anyone it's you who
can bring us that information.

403
00:35:39,623 --> 00:35:44,494
This is essential
to the bureau's mission.

404
00:35:44,527 --> 00:35:46,931
And I have
the utmost confidence in you.

405
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:49,934
Come.

406
00:35:57,174 --> 00:35:58,642
Well, hello there, Alan.

407
00:35:58,675 --> 00:36:00,744
I'm very sorry
for the long wait.

408
00:36:00,778 --> 00:36:03,713
Nance Cooper. Well, you know me.
I like killing time.

409
00:36:03,747 --> 00:36:06,817
- You know how I am.
- I do know how you are.

410
00:36:06,851 --> 00:36:10,587
Let me introduce Simin Hakak.

411
00:36:10,620 --> 00:36:12,089
Did I pronounce that correctly?

412
00:36:12,123 --> 00:36:14,491
- Yeah.
- Okay. Good.

413
00:36:14,524 --> 00:36:20,865
Simin is Iranian. And she is one
of our very best and brightest.

414
00:36:20,898 --> 00:36:23,733
- Wonderful.
- And this gentleman,

415
00:36:23,768 --> 00:36:27,838
and I use that term loosely,
is Alan Villin.

416
00:36:29,673 --> 00:36:33,610
- Villain?
- Yeah, it's Villin. V-I-L-L-I-N.

417
00:36:34,779 --> 00:36:38,149
Alan here works
in law enforcement.

418
00:36:38,182 --> 00:36:41,052
You see, recently we've received
a number of reports

419
00:36:41,085 --> 00:36:43,821
of violence against some
of our Census workers.

420
00:36:43,854 --> 00:36:46,891
- It is a jungle out there, right?
- Yeah.

421
00:36:46,924 --> 00:36:50,995
So Alan will accompany you
from now on. Just to be safe.

422
00:36:53,030 --> 00:36:56,801
Best of luck to you today,
Simin Jaan.

423
00:37:00,805 --> 00:37:02,073
You ready to roll?

424
00:37:02,873 --> 00:37:04,541
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay.

425
00:37:07,111 --> 00:37:09,880
[inhales, sighs]

426
00:37:15,219 --> 00:37:17,021
- Excuse me.
- Yeah.

427
00:37:17,054 --> 00:37:18,956
I can't tell
from this assignment.

428
00:37:18,990 --> 00:37:20,057
Where are we going?

429
00:37:20,091 --> 00:37:21,591
Oh.

430
00:37:24,829 --> 00:37:29,133
- I'm taking you back home.
- Back home?

431
00:37:29,166 --> 00:37:32,169
The Land of Roses
and Nightingales.

432
00:37:32,203 --> 00:37:36,073
Trust me.
It'll be fun. Hop on.

433
00:37:37,775 --> 00:37:39,944
- I'll take my own car.
- Sure.

434
00:37:39,977 --> 00:37:41,278
- Yeah.
- Okay.

435
00:37:43,314 --> 00:37:44,647
Just follow me.

436
00:37:46,317 --> 00:37:48,786
[ambient music playing]

437
00:38:41,272 --> 00:38:42,807

[indistinct cheering
at a distance]

439
00:38:45,843 --> 00:38:47,912
What is this?

440
00:38:47,945 --> 00:38:51,215
How's your Farsi?
Still pretty good?

441
00:38:53,984 --> 00:38:57,388
It's okay. Why?

442
00:38:57,421 --> 00:39:03,160
Well, if not, it's going to
be a great place to practice.

443
00:39:08,799 --> 00:39:10,733
[pounding]

444

[laughs]

446
00:39:32,022 --> 00:39:35,860
- As-salaamu Alaikum.
- You again?

447
00:39:35,893 --> 00:39:39,029
This time I brought
a lovely guest.

448
00:39:39,063 --> 00:39:41,165
She just landed from Iran.

449
00:39:41,198 --> 00:39:44,667
You know, she's come
all the way here to see you.

450
00:39:44,701 --> 00:39:47,037
Muhammad, say hi to Simin.

451
00:39:47,071 --> 00:39:50,307
Simin, go ahead
and say hi to Muhammad.

452
00:39:50,975 --> 00:39:52,009
Salaam.

453
00:39:53,110 --> 00:39:54,644
Salaam.

456
00:40:07,057 --> 00:40:08,425
You can't come in.

457
00:40:09,726 --> 00:40:11,362
I know the rules, Muhammad.

458
00:40:12,897 --> 00:40:14,098

Simin.

480
00:46:15,325 --> 00:46:17,494
- Mark.
- Who else?

481
00:46:19,396 --> 00:46:21,698
- What are you doing here?
- I was looking for you.

482
00:46:23,300 --> 00:46:25,135
- Why?
- So I wouldn't lose you.

483
00:46:26,670 --> 00:46:29,740
- Did you follow me?
- Of course.

484
00:46:34,478 --> 00:46:37,247
- Who's this?
- Hey.

485
00:46:37,281 --> 00:46:40,317
- Hey.
- Were you waiting for us?

486
00:46:43,287 --> 00:46:45,389
- I was waiting for her.
- So you already know her.

487
00:46:45,422 --> 00:46:49,526
- We came together.
- You work for the Census?

488
00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:51,763
[Alan] Yeah.
In a way I do.

489
00:46:51,796 --> 00:46:53,831
What exactly do you do?

490
00:46:56,533 --> 00:46:59,303
I don't have to
answer that, do I?

491
00:46:59,336 --> 00:47:02,306
Okay. In that case,
I choose not to.

492
00:47:02,339 --> 00:47:05,777
Let's say that
I'm just doing my job.

493
00:47:08,913 --> 00:47:12,316
- Alan is my bodyguard.
- Bodyguard?

494
00:47:12,349 --> 00:47:13,717
You need protection?

495
00:47:14,819 --> 00:47:16,153
From what?

496
00:47:17,621 --> 00:47:18,655
From you.

497
00:47:20,324 --> 00:47:21,793
You don't know
anything about me.

498
00:47:25,195 --> 00:47:26,430
What do I need to know?

499
00:47:30,534 --> 00:47:32,369
I'm in love with her.

500
00:47:32,402 --> 00:47:34,371
[Alan chuckles]

501
00:47:34,404 --> 00:47:36,506
Maybe that's why
she needs protection.

[motorcycle engine whirring]

506
00:48:41,605 --> 00:48:43,306
So you're going
to tell me anything?

507
00:48:44,909 --> 00:48:46,410
Tell you what?

508
00:48:47,511 --> 00:48:49,814
Hey, was that guy Mark,

509
00:48:49,847 --> 00:48:51,849
was he asking questions
about your assignment?

510
00:48:51,883 --> 00:48:54,317
No.

511
00:48:54,351 --> 00:48:56,386
[Simin] Are you going
to answer me?

512
00:48:56,420 --> 00:48:59,489
Look, those people,

513
00:48:59,523 --> 00:49:01,725
they've been in there
for a long time.

514
00:49:01,759 --> 00:49:04,461
Almost 30 years.
They're lost souls.

515
00:49:04,494 --> 00:49:06,697
How is it possible that no one
knows they're there?

516
00:49:06,730 --> 00:49:08,465
I wouldn't say no one.

517
00:49:10,333 --> 00:49:12,202
Let's just say that...

518
00:49:15,639 --> 00:49:18,442
it's a nicely kept
little secret.

519
00:49:21,913 --> 00:49:24,882
Were you able to do your job?

520
00:49:24,916 --> 00:49:28,618
- My job?
- Yeah. Census.

521
00:49:31,856 --> 00:49:34,257
Tell me what's going on.

522
00:49:34,291 --> 00:49:37,461
I don't make up the rules.
I'm just here to protect you.

00:49:52,844 --> 00:49:54,511
Look who it is.

525
00:49:55,712 --> 00:49:57,380
The handsome suitor.

526
00:50:18,903 --> 00:50:20,403
[knock on door]

527
00:50:23,007 --> 00:50:26,043
- Who is it?
- Yeah, hey, it's Alan.

528
00:50:31,681 --> 00:50:32,917
Just a minute.

529
00:50:35,119 --> 00:50:39,389
[door unlocks]

530
00:50:39,422 --> 00:50:43,928
I'm sorry. I was kind of rude at the
gas station and I wanted to apologize.

531
00:50:43,961 --> 00:50:46,964
It was insensitive of me.

532
00:50:46,998 --> 00:50:50,467
It must've been traumatic
for you, visiting The Colony.

533
00:50:50,500 --> 00:50:52,937
You call it The Colony?

534
00:50:54,671 --> 00:50:55,840
Can I come in?

535
00:50:58,009 --> 00:51:01,879
The American government
was conducting an experiment.

536
00:51:01,913 --> 00:51:06,550
All those people
you saw over there,

537
00:51:06,583 --> 00:51:10,353
they were old revolutionaries
fighting the Islamic state.

538
00:51:10,387 --> 00:51:13,456
We didn't care that much for
the revolutionaries either.

539
00:51:15,092 --> 00:51:18,796
You know, the enemy
of our enemy is our friend.

540
00:51:20,664 --> 00:51:24,367
And that was like 30 years ago.
Thirty years ago.

541
00:51:25,036 --> 00:51:26,703
They never left.

542
00:51:28,638 --> 00:51:30,507
Paranoid I guess.

543
00:51:51,628 --> 00:51:52,964
Wow.

544
00:51:56,600 --> 00:51:57,768
Get a load of this.

545
00:52:01,738 --> 00:52:03,673
It's just a hobby.

546
00:52:04,842 --> 00:52:06,944
Just something to kill time.

547
00:52:06,978 --> 00:52:12,482
Because, I mean, you know.
So much fucking time out here.

548
00:52:13,951 --> 00:52:15,385
What do you do?

549
00:52:17,121 --> 00:52:18,856
I gamble, that's what I do.

550
00:52:24,161 --> 00:52:29,166
Hey, can I ask you
a personal question?

551
00:52:30,902 --> 00:52:32,569
Personal?
I'd rather not.

552
00:52:34,238 --> 00:52:37,707
All right.
I understand. Well...

553
00:52:39,676 --> 00:52:41,112
I better get going.

554
00:52:44,514 --> 00:52:46,017
Sorry for disturbing you.

555
00:52:50,121 --> 00:52:51,989
Oh, listen...

556
00:52:52,023 --> 00:52:53,190
This guy, uh...

557
00:52:53,224 --> 00:52:56,459
This guy Mark,
is he bothering you?

558
00:52:56,493 --> 00:52:59,663
All you have to do
is say the word.

559
00:53:00,264 --> 00:53:02,099
Mark is harmless.

560
00:53:03,267 --> 00:53:04,902
You don't have
to worry about him.

561
00:53:06,270 --> 00:53:08,738
Hey, you want to grab a drink?

562
00:53:08,773 --> 00:53:09,974
No, thank you.

563
00:53:10,841 --> 00:53:14,477
Okay. Well, then...

564
00:53:16,746 --> 00:53:17,982
sweet dreams.

565
00:53:49,246 --> 00:53:50,714
[tapping]

566
00:53:50,747 --> 00:53:54,185
Simin. Good. Come in.
Have a seat.

567
00:53:56,887 --> 00:53:59,890
- How are you?
- I'm fine.

568
00:53:59,924 --> 00:54:02,793
Simin, are you all right?
You look exhausted.

569
00:54:02,827 --> 00:54:05,662
I didn't sleep well last night.

570
00:54:05,695 --> 00:54:07,664
I'm sorry to hear that.

571
00:54:07,697 --> 00:54:12,036
I know it was a tough assignment
going to The Colony.

572
00:54:12,069 --> 00:54:16,807
But I am very excited to see
what you've brought us.

573
00:54:16,841 --> 00:54:19,276
May I have the file
and the audio, please?

574
00:54:20,277 --> 00:54:21,678
I have nothing.

575
00:54:23,180 --> 00:54:25,249
Why did you send me there,
Nancy?

576
00:54:28,219 --> 00:54:30,988
What do you mean?
I told you.

577
00:54:31,022 --> 00:54:33,324
We need information
from that place.

578
00:54:33,357 --> 00:54:35,226
We need it urgently.

579
00:54:35,259 --> 00:54:40,663
Look, I do understand that
The Colony may have shocked you.

580
00:54:40,697 --> 00:54:43,533
But you were sent there
on a crucial mission.

581
00:54:45,770 --> 00:54:48,773
I am so sorry it proved
to be too much for you.

582
00:54:50,740 --> 00:54:52,609
Anyway, here, I believe,

583
00:54:52,642 --> 00:54:56,213
here is your assignment,
yes, for today.

584
00:54:56,247 --> 00:55:01,886
And I believe Alan
is waiting outside for you.

585
00:55:01,919 --> 00:55:05,189
By the way,
how is it going with Alan?

586
00:55:05,222 --> 00:55:07,324
He's a fun guy, you know.

587
00:55:08,292 --> 00:55:11,762
Yeah, I like Alan.

588
00:55:11,796 --> 00:55:15,632
Good. Okay.
Good luck today.

589
00:55:18,069 --> 00:55:20,104
And Simin.

590
00:55:20,137 --> 00:55:23,140
Please try to get some rest
tonight, okay?

591
00:55:32,249 --> 00:55:34,251
[Mark] <i>If you can keep</i>

- Hi.

606
00:56:25,469 --> 00:56:26,871
I knew it was you.

607
00:56:28,372 --> 00:56:30,007
Get in.

608
00:56:34,879 --> 00:56:36,280
[sighs]

609
00:56:36,313 --> 00:56:40,784
What are you doing out here?
How can you be everywhere?

610
00:56:40,818 --> 00:56:42,386
[Mark]
I like to walk.

611
00:56:42,419 --> 00:56:46,290
That way I'm everywhere
and nowhere at the same time.

612
00:56:54,265 --> 00:56:57,734
- Do you work, Mark?
- Only when I have to.

613
00:57:00,938 --> 00:57:03,274
[Simin] Otherwise you just
walk around aimlessly?

614
00:57:03,307 --> 00:57:05,209
[Mark]
I wouldn't say aimlessly.

615
00:57:05,242 --> 00:57:08,312
I like to walk to places
and write poems.

616
00:57:10,281 --> 00:57:11,415
Poems?

617
00:57:11,448 --> 00:57:12,926
Of all people,
you can't be surprised.

618
00:57:12,950 --> 00:57:15,152
Don't you come from
the land of poets?

619
00:57:15,186 --> 00:57:20,157
Hafiz, Khayam, Saadi, Rumi.
Didn't Rumi do what I do?

620
00:57:21,292 --> 00:57:23,894
Wander around, intoxicated,

621
00:57:23,928 --> 00:57:26,363
whirling,
speaking the poem's voice?

622
00:57:28,032 --> 00:57:30,234
Is that your poetry notebook?

623
00:57:31,502 --> 00:57:35,773
Yeah, it is.
Short poems, Haikus.

624
00:57:36,941 --> 00:57:38,943
[Simin] Why don't you
read me one?

625
00:57:38,976 --> 00:57:40,477
[Mark] Since you asked
so nicely.

626

<i>What a relief
for these cloudy days</i>

629
00:57:54,858 --> 00:57:57,361
Well, I see now why you don't
like to share your dreams.

630
00:57:58,829 --> 00:58:00,831
You're afraid
of your own shadow.

631
00:58:00,864 --> 00:58:02,199
Possibly.

632
00:58:05,536 --> 00:58:09,039

[car door closes]

634
00:58:51,915 --> 00:58:55,085
Didn't your mother teach you not
to pick up hitchhikers?

635
00:58:55,119 --> 00:58:58,022
- Can you just wait out here?
- Why?

636
00:58:59,556 --> 00:59:01,058

[knocking]

639
00:59:17,308 --> 00:59:22,346
- Hi. Is this the Teso's residence?
- Yes, it is.

640
00:59:22,379 --> 00:59:27,217
Um, my name is Simin.
I work for the Census Bureau.

641
00:59:27,251 --> 00:59:29,119
I just need to ask you
a few questions.

642
00:59:29,153 --> 00:59:31,622
What kind of questions?

643
00:59:31,655 --> 00:59:35,392
Just some basic
census questions.

644
00:59:35,426 --> 00:59:37,461
What is that cop doing with you?

645
00:59:38,929 --> 00:59:41,065
[Simin] Uh...

646
00:59:41,098 --> 00:59:43,033
[woman speaking Japanese]

647
00:59:45,536 --> 00:59:49,440
Can you excuse me? I'll be
back in a couple of minutes.

648
00:59:49,473 --> 00:59:50,507
Okay.

649
01:00:00,984 --> 01:00:05,489
I think you should leave.
And will you take Mark with you?

650
01:00:06,957 --> 01:00:08,459
You know,
you don't have to like me.

651
01:00:08,492 --> 01:00:10,361
But it's my job to protect you.

652
01:00:11,528 --> 01:00:12,963
Please.

653
01:00:15,165 --> 01:00:18,902
Okay.
Whatever you say.

654
01:00:18,936 --> 01:00:20,237
Give me a call if you need me.

655
01:00:29,012 --> 01:00:31,348
Hey, man. She's going
to be here for awhile.

656
01:00:31,382 --> 01:00:33,417
Why don't you and I
go grab a drink?

657
01:00:33,450 --> 01:00:34,651
You buying?

658
01:00:43,961 --> 01:00:46,430
[motorcycle engine starts]

659
01:00:52,369 --> 01:00:54,104
[Simin] Oh, uh...

660
01:00:54,138 --> 01:00:56,306
I asked them to leave.

661
01:00:56,340 --> 01:00:59,176
As I was saying.
I work for the Census.

662
01:00:59,209 --> 01:01:01,578
[woman speaks in Japanese]

663
01:01:05,048 --> 01:01:07,384
I'm sorry.
My family isn't interested.

664
01:01:07,418 --> 01:01:09,987
If you can please excuse me now.

665
01:01:12,055 --> 01:01:13,357
[door locks]

666
01:01:15,092 --> 01:01:16,660
[Alan]
<i>I like to avoid thinking.</i>

667
01:01:16,693 --> 01:01:18,962
<i>No expectations about anything.</i>

668
01:01:18,996 --> 01:01:21,965
That way you can't harm anybody.
Or anything.

669
01:01:21,999 --> 01:01:26,470
So you're saying
thinking can harm the world.

670
01:01:26,503 --> 01:01:30,040
Absolutely.
Thinking can harm the world.

671
01:01:31,675 --> 01:01:36,180
Well, look at that.
Your future fiancée.

672
01:01:37,648 --> 01:01:41,385
- You going to propose to her?
- Absolutely.

673
01:01:41,418 --> 01:01:44,188
- What if she says no?
- She won't.

674
01:01:44,221 --> 01:01:47,391
- So she's the one?
- She's the only one.

675
01:01:48,392 --> 01:01:50,994
Look, be careful with her.

676
01:01:51,028 --> 01:01:53,430
She seems nice,
she's pretty, but...

677
01:01:53,464 --> 01:01:54,498
But what?

678
01:01:57,100 --> 01:01:59,269
- When did you meet her?
- A few days ago.

679
01:02:02,339 --> 01:02:03,540
- Hi.
- Hi.

680
01:02:05,709 --> 01:02:09,079
I bet you were the first census
worker to knock on that door.

681
01:02:09,112 --> 01:02:13,217
They didn't even let me in.
Vodka on the rocks, please.

682
01:02:17,488 --> 01:02:20,224
We were just talking about how
Mark wants to get married,

683
01:02:20,257 --> 01:02:22,159
have kids, become a family man.

684
01:02:22,192 --> 01:02:24,762
You don't get married
just to have children.

685
01:02:24,796 --> 01:02:29,266
You get married, so that
you can be two instead of one.

686
01:02:30,701 --> 01:02:34,338
Of course. Two, then three,
then more. You'll see.

687
01:02:35,506 --> 01:02:38,275
- Are you married, Alan?
- I was.

688
01:02:39,409 --> 01:02:42,713
My wife left me 11 years ago.

689
01:02:42,746 --> 01:02:47,551
December 22nd,
10 o'clock in the morning.

690
01:02:47,584 --> 01:02:49,052
[Mark]
For another man?

691
01:02:50,320 --> 01:02:52,723
Two other men.

692
01:02:52,757 --> 01:02:56,393
- Did you know them?
- We used to play poker together.

693
01:02:56,426 --> 01:02:58,729
[Simin]
Did you have kids?

694
01:02:58,763 --> 01:03:02,199
No, we never got around to that.
Thank God.

695
01:03:02,232 --> 01:03:03,634
She sure did the right thing.

696
01:03:07,704 --> 01:03:10,207
I still have one more family

Somebody spoke those words
to me at The Colony.

1047

01:38:06,771 --> 01:38:13,644
The border between dream
and reality is a very thin one.

1065
01:38:15,212 --> 01:38:19,917
Dr. Palmer,
perhaps you can explain.

1066
01:38:19,951 --> 01:38:23,888
[Dr. Palmer] This lady
is an unusual case.

1067
01:38:23,921 --> 01:38:30,460
I believe she's either borderline or
she already slipped into a disorder.

a fantastic world,

it as factual reality.

1070
01:38:35,699 --> 01:38:40,270
She has to stop working

Whose reality?

1075
01:38:58,321 --> 01:39:00,724
And if you're so interested
in reality,

1076
01:39:00,758 --> 01:39:03,326
why are you

1077
01:39:07,597 --> 01:39:08,966
I admit it.

protecting them?

1082

You'll never be able
to control people's dreams.

1083
01:39:29,020 --> 01:39:33,724
No. Their dreams are theirs
and theirs alone.
