00:35:35,267 --> 00:35:37,736
Thank you. This place is...
pretty special.

720
00:35:37,769 --> 00:35:39,605
Uh-huh.

721
00:35:39,638 --> 00:35:42,208
Would you like to join us
in saying grace?

722
00:35:42,241 --> 00:35:44,810
Yeah, you bet, Charlie.
[Chuckles]

723
00:35:48,247 --> 00:35:51,783
Life is God.

724
00:35:51,817 --> 00:35:55,821
Birds. Bugs. Trees.

725

The sun.

726
00:35:57,989 --> 00:36:01,460
Some people,
they got God up on a cross.

727
00:36:01,493 --> 00:36:03,762
And they're all kneeling down,
hoping that when they die,

728
00:36:03,795 --> 00:36:05,331
They're gonna go to
a better place.

729
00:36:05,364 --> 00:36:07,399
But guess what? Death...

730
00:36:07,433 --> 00:36:09,368
It doesn't exist. [Laughs]

731
00:36:09,401 --> 00:36:11,903
It's life, baby.
That's the truth.

732
00:36:11,937 --> 00:36:14,273
And how do I know?
Because I...

733
00:36:14,306 --> 00:36:16,942
I'm a messenger of truth.

734
00:36:16,975 --> 00:36:19,978
And you all you here...

735
00:36:20,011 --> 00:36:22,748
You're my church.

736
00:36:25,517 --> 00:36:27,319
Amen?

737
00:36:27,353 --> 00:36:29,388
WOMAN: Mm.

738
00:36:29,421 --> 00:36:30,922
Amen, brother. Let's eat.

739

Whew!
[Charlie laughs]

741
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:37,229
So, Gary, so you been listening
to "The White Album"?

742
00:36:37,263 --> 00:36:38,497
Yeah, I heard it.

743
00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:40,599
Those boys from Liverpool
are geniuses,

744
00:36:40,632 --> 00:36:42,268
Talking about how
there's gonna be a race war.

745
00:36:42,301 --> 00:36:44,336
A race war?

746
00:36:44,370 --> 00:36:47,439
Well, look at
the Watts Riots, Gary.

747
00:36:47,473 --> 00:36:48,940
I mean, we gotta be prepared.

748
00:36:48,974 --> 00:36:51,410
It's all there.
It's in "Helter Skeltter."

749
00:36:51,443 --> 00:36:54,246
Really? I-I didn't get that.

750
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:55,447
[Utensils clinking]

"You say you want
a revolution"?

752

Uh-huh.
I do, man!

753
00:36:58,917 --> 00:37:01,820
And you better believe
happiness comes from a warm gun.

754
00:37:01,853 --> 00:37:03,855
I mean, don't you watch
the news, read the papers?

755
00:37:03,889 --> 00:37:05,991
The... the blacks are...
Are pissed off,

756
00:37:06,024 --> 00:37:08,327
And... and it's all gonna
go down real soon.

757
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:10,929
Do you... do you think
you're special, Bobby?

758
00:37:13,865 --> 00:37:15,767
No, man.

759
00:37:15,801 --> 00:37:16,935
[Chuckles nervously]

760
00:37:16,968 --> 00:37:19,237
Not at all.
W-Why... why you ask?

761
00:37:20,806 --> 00:37:22,941
You're taking more than
your share of peas.

762
00:37:22,974 --> 00:37:24,810
[Chuckles]

763
00:37:24,843 --> 00:37:28,980
We are all equals here,

764
00:37:29,014 --> 00:37:31,483
But apparently, one of
our family members thinks

765
00:37:31,517 --> 00:37:32,984
That he's the prime minister
and president

766
00:37:33,018 --> 00:37:34,986
Of all the world's peas!
[Slams table]

767
00:37:36,988 --> 00:37:39,891
I don't even like peas,
so, Bobby, you can have mine.

768
00:37:39,925 --> 00:37:41,427
No, no, that's not the point!

769
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:43,629
[Spoon scrapes plate]
[Whispers] Sorry.

770
00:37:43,662 --> 00:37:46,064
GARY: It's okay, Bobby.
It's fine.

771
00:37:46,097 --> 00:37:47,466
Sorry, Charlie.

772
00:37:48,767 --> 00:37:51,603
Just feel your remorse, son,
and let it go.

773
00:37:51,637 --> 00:37:54,272
You'll make it up
to me later.

774
00:37:57,976 --> 00:37:59,978
So, Gary, I heard that your pop
recently passed away.

775
00:38:00,011 --> 00:38:02,348
I'm so sorry to hear that, man.

776
00:38:02,381 --> 00:38:06,352
Gonna fly with the...
The angels, right?

777
00:38:06,385 --> 00:38:07,519
Thanks, Charlie.

778
00:38:07,553 --> 00:38:09,421
Did he leave you any money?

779

Good to see you.
Good to see you.

785

How you doing?

786
00:38:45,657 --> 00:38:48,360
So listen...
[Clears throat]

787
00:38:48,394 --> 00:38:50,862
Columbia is gonna
respectfully pass.

788
00:38:50,896 --> 00:38:54,500
There's no record deal.
I'm sorry.

789
00:38:54,533 --> 00:38:56,668
CHARLIE: No, man, that's bull!
Terry's out there.

790
00:38:56,702 --> 00:39:01,740
Even though I spoke to the label
several times, Charlie.

791
00:39:01,773 --> 00:39:03,642
And I'm sorry,
but they're just not interested.

792
00:39:03,675 --> 00:39:05,110
But you... you said
they were interested!

793
00:39:05,143 --> 00:39:06,645
You said my music was better
than Dylan's!

794
00:39:06,678 --> 00:39:08,079
I don't think I ever
said that.

795
00:39:08,113 --> 00:39:10,148
You calling me a liar?

796
00:39:10,181 --> 00:39:13,685
No, man. No.

797
00:39:13,719 --> 00:39:16,422
No, but getting a record deal,
it's not...

798
00:39:16,455 --> 00:39:18,023
It's not easy.

799
00:39:18,056 --> 00:39:20,926
I told you
it was a long shot.

800
00:39:23,429 --> 00:39:25,964
You promised me.

801
00:39:25,997 --> 00:39:28,099
Bad things happen to people
who break promises.

802
00:39:28,133 --> 00:39:29,868
Whoa...

803
00:39:29,901 --> 00:39:31,403
Is that some kind
of a threat?

804
00:39:31,437 --> 00:39:33,472
Threat?

805
00:39:33,505 --> 00:39:34,806
It is what it is.

Should we go?
No. No, wait.

We don't need Melcher.

817

We can get our own deal.

818
00:40:25,056 --> 00:40:27,058
Find a new label.

819
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:30,996
You think so?

820
00:40:31,029 --> 00:40:32,798
Yeah.

821
00:40:35,867 --> 00:40:38,737
What do you think, Tex? You
think we could find a new label?
[Trunk creaks]

Charlie, I think it's anything
you put your mind to.

You're so... goddamn smart.

this family.

No way, man.
Not without you, Charlie.

00:54:21,592 --> 00:54:23,461
It's the Panthers.
Panthers?

1076
00:54:23,494 --> 00:54:24,929
Lotsapopsa was one of 'em.

1077
00:54:24,962 --> 00:54:28,666
[Breathing heavily]

1078
00:54:28,699 --> 00:54:32,770
[Wind blowing]

1079
00:54:32,803 --> 00:54:35,005
[Fire crackling]

1080
00:54:39,977 --> 00:54:42,947
Armageddon is here.

1081
00:54:42,980 --> 00:54:45,716
Don't ask why,
don't be frightened.

1082
00:54:47,117 --> 00:54:50,855
Pain isn't a bad thing.

1083
00:54:50,888 --> 00:54:53,858
It's good.
It teaches us things.

1084
00:54:53,891 --> 00:54:56,994
Now trust in me.

1085
00:54:57,027 --> 00:54:59,897
As I've trusted in you.

1086
00:55:02,500 --> 00:55:06,537
The black man is
gonna be on top.

1087
00:55:06,571 --> 00:55:09,507
And it's comin' soon.

1088
00:55:09,540 --> 00:55:11,609
And the black man
is gonna win

1089
00:55:11,642 --> 00:55:13,478
'Cause he's got nothing to lose.

1090
00:55:13,511 --> 00:55:15,946
They're gonna need
someone to lead them

1091
00:55:15,980 --> 00:55:18,015
Through the desert.

1092
00:55:18,048 --> 00:55:19,750
A Moses.

1093
00:55:19,784 --> 00:55:21,986
That's you!
That's you, Charlie!

1094
00:55:22,019 --> 00:55:23,888
A Moses with a vision.

1095
00:55:23,921 --> 00:55:25,356
Yeah!
Yes!

1096
00:55:25,390 --> 00:55:28,759
A Moses to lead them
to the promised land!

1097
00:55:28,793 --> 00:55:30,027
ALL: Yeah!

1098
00:55:30,060 --> 00:55:32,897
Now I want all of you
to get up and dance

1099
00:55:32,930 --> 00:55:34,599
Like it's your last day
on Earth!

1100
00:55:34,632 --> 00:55:38,035
Like it's your last night
to dance with freedom!

1101
00:55:38,068 --> 00:55:39,970
My soldiers! My family!

1102
00:55:40,004 --> 00:55:41,772
ALL: Yeah!
That's right!

1103
00:55:41,806 --> 00:55:44,775
[Screams]

1104
00:55:44,809 --> 00:55:47,712
*

1105
00:55:51,816 --> 00:55:56,687
WOMAN: * Ooh, ooh, ooh

1106
00:56:01,692 --> 00:56:05,396
* Ooh, ooh, ooh

1107
00:56:09,434 --> 00:56:10,801
[Cheering]

1108
00:56:10,835 --> 00:56:14,639
LINDA:
It was a rush, a calling.

1109
00:56:14,672 --> 00:56:17,942
We thought we were eternal.

1110
00:56:17,975 --> 00:56:21,178
CHARLIE: I would kill for you.
Would you kill for me?

1111
00:56:21,211 --> 00:56:22,947
ALL: Yes, Charlie.
WOMAN: Yes.

1112
00:56:22,980 --> 00:56:24,882
CHARLIE:
Would you die for me?

1113
00:56:24,915 --> 00:56:26,150
ALL: Yes!

1114
00:56:26,183 --> 00:56:27,918
[Drums pounding]

1115
00:56:27,952 --> 00:56:30,821
[Gunshots]

1116
00:56:30,855 --> 00:56:33,090
LINDA:
I've never seen so many guns.

1117
00:56:33,123 --> 00:56:35,926
Charlie must've gotten more.

1118
00:56:35,960 --> 00:56:37,862
A lot more.

1119
00:56:37,895 --> 00:56:39,830
[Gunshots continue]
Whoo!

1120
00:56:39,864 --> 00:56:42,066
That's how you do it, Bobby!

1121
00:56:42,099 --> 00:56:43,968
Okay, if you wanna stab,

1122
00:56:44,001 --> 00:56:46,036
What you wanna do is aim
for this gut here.

1123
00:56:46,070 --> 00:56:48,105
Once you're in, turn.

1124
00:56:48,138 --> 00:56:51,909
CHARLIE: Time doesn't exist.
Life doesn't exist.

1125
00:56:51,942 --> 00:56:56,814
It's all the same thing,
baby! It's all the same!

1126
00:56:56,847 --> 00:56:59,149
Everything's the same!
[Women giggle]

1127
00:56:59,183 --> 00:57:02,152
You are perfect.
You are perfect.

1128
00:57:02,186 --> 00:57:04,689
You are perfect.

1129
00:57:06,123 --> 00:57:07,958
[Imitates gunshot]

1130
00:57:07,992 --> 00:57:09,994
[Laughter]

1131
00:57:10,027 --> 00:57:15,966
What was it like?
When Charlie killed Lotsapopsa?

1132
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,869
One minute,
he was yelling about his money,

1133
00:57:18,903 --> 00:57:20,204
Next minute,
he's lying on the floor.

1134
00:57:20,237 --> 00:57:21,872
I thought he grabbed Charlie.

1135
00:57:21,906 --> 00:57:23,474
Yeah, he did, sorta. Yes.

1136
00:57:23,508 --> 00:57:25,643
Who cares?

1137
00:57:25,676 --> 00:57:27,812
How much blood was there?
What was it like?

1138
00:57:27,845 --> 00:57:30,881
Was it like a big pool of red?
Yeah, there was.

1139
00:57:30,915 --> 00:57:32,783
If the Panthers are coming,

1140
00:57:32,817 --> 00:57:36,654
Why don't we just take the kids
and go to the desert?

1141
00:57:36,687 --> 00:57:38,789
Are you questioning Charlie?

1142
00:57:38,823 --> 00:57:40,891
I don't think she was.
I'm not talking to you.

1143
00:57:40,925 --> 00:57:42,927
I'm just thinking
about Tanya.

1144
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:45,062
I've got a kid, too, remember?

1145
00:57:45,095 --> 00:57:46,931
You don't see me
wanting to leave.

1146
00:57:49,967 --> 00:57:51,101
[Imitates gunshot]

1147
00:57:54,805 --> 00:57:57,908
I'll give 'em this.

1148
00:57:57,942 --> 00:57:59,844
They know the power of an image.

1149
00:57:59,877 --> 00:58:04,982
See, that says strength.

1150
00:58:05,015 --> 00:58:08,986
It says, "don't mess with me."

1151
00:58:12,923 --> 00:58:15,225
The cop piggies,
political piggies,

1152
00:58:15,259 --> 00:58:18,295
The Panther piggies.

1153
00:58:18,328 --> 00:58:21,231
They're all gonna burn
when Helter Skelter comes.

1154
00:58:23,033 --> 00:58:25,736
If there's one thing
I learned in prison,

1155
00:58:25,770 --> 00:58:28,138
Is that when the odds
are against you,

1156
00:58:28,172 --> 00:58:31,842
Your best weapon is
the element of surprise.

1157
00:58:36,313 --> 00:58:40,818
[Gasps, breathing heavily]

1158
00:58:40,851 --> 00:58:41,952
Now one little move,

1159
00:58:41,986 --> 00:58:44,154
And I'm holding her head
in my hand.

1160
00:58:44,188 --> 00:58:45,923
That's how you kill
in close quarters.

1161
00:58:45,956 --> 00:58:47,157
No muss, no fuss.

1162
00:58:47,191 --> 00:58:49,293
Now if your enemy's
coming at you...

1163
00:58:49,326 --> 00:58:51,629
[Gasps, breathing heavily]

1164
00:58:51,662 --> 00:58:55,933
Charlie!

1165
00:58:55,966 --> 00:58:58,268
I don't... uh...

1166
00:58:58,302 --> 00:59:02,206
[Gasping]

1167
00:59:06,376 --> 00:59:09,213
[Smack]

1168
00:59:09,246 --> 00:59:13,083
Hmm. [Sniffs]

1169
00:59:13,117 --> 00:59:14,652
Hey, hey.

1170
00:59:14,685 --> 00:59:16,787
I do the thinking.

1171
00:59:16,821 --> 00:59:18,322
Now you gotta prove
yourself to me.

1172
00:59:23,093 --> 00:59:26,163
*

1173
00:59:27,264 --> 00:59:29,233
Come here, baby.

1174
00:59:32,302 --> 00:59:34,772
Come here.

1175
00:59:40,210 --> 00:59:43,047
Come on, man, we're brothers.

1176
00:59:43,080 --> 00:59:44,348
When one brother's in need,

1177
00:59:44,381 --> 00:59:45,850
The other one's
gotta come through.

1178
00:59:45,883 --> 00:59:47,284
I don't have any money.
Aah!

1179
00:59:47,317 --> 00:59:48,886
You said your old man
left you some.

1180
00:59:48,919 --> 00:59:52,156
[Gasps] 10 grand is all.
It's already gone.

1181
00:59:52,189 --> 00:59:54,058
I spent it. I bought...
I bought a car.

1182
00:59:54,091 --> 00:59:56,393
I had bills to pay.

1183
00:59:56,426 --> 00:59:58,095
You expect me to believe that?

1184
00:59:58,128 --> 00:59:59,263
I'm telling you, Charlie.

1185
00:59:59,296 --> 01:00:02,366
[Crying]

1186
01:00:08,939 --> 01:00:11,676
[Blade zings]

1187
01:00:18,348 --> 01:00:21,618
[Gasping]

1188
01:00:29,326 --> 01:00:31,295
We got a war to fight, man.

1189
01:00:31,328 --> 01:00:33,330
What war?

1190
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:39,069
Now if they're gonna come
after us...

1191
01:00:42,472 --> 01:00:44,374
They're gonna
come after you, too.

1192
01:00:44,408 --> 01:00:48,112
Who's gonna come after me,
Charlie? Oh, God!

1193
01:00:48,145 --> 01:00:51,148
Ah!

1194
01:00:51,181 --> 01:00:54,118
Bobby! Oh, God.

1195
01:00:54,151 --> 01:00:56,153
[Crying]

1196
01:00:56,186 --> 01:00:57,421
Help me, man!

1197
01:00:57,454 --> 01:00:59,256
Take care of him.

1198
01:01:02,092 --> 01:01:03,327
Charlie.

1199
01:01:03,360 --> 01:01:11,035
[Gasping] Shh.

1200
01:01:11,068 --> 01:01:13,337
You guys, just leave.
I'm not gonna tell anybody.

1201
01:01:13,370 --> 01:01:15,005
You know me.
Don't believe him.

1202
01:01:15,039 --> 01:01:17,775
I swear to God.
He's gonna blackmail Charlie.

1203
01:01:17,808 --> 01:01:19,109
No, I won't.
Don't. He's lying.

1204
01:01:19,143 --> 01:01:21,378
Bobby, you know me.
We're...

1205
01:01:21,411 --> 01:01:23,313
[Grunts]

1206
01:01:23,347 --> 01:01:28,118
[Gasping and choking]

1207
01:01:30,054 --> 01:01:33,223
[Gasping and grunting]

1208
01:01:40,197 --> 01:01:42,032
[Grunting stops]

1209
01:01:48,072 --> 01:01:49,339
The Panthers.

1210
01:01:49,373 --> 01:01:51,776
They'll think
it's the Panthers.

1211
01:01:51,809 --> 01:01:54,011
It's gonna be cool, man.

1212
01:01:54,044 --> 01:01:55,479
What if they don't blame it
on the Panthers?

1213
01:01:55,512 --> 01:01:57,782
It was just some scribbling
on a wall.

1214
01:01:57,815 --> 01:01:59,817
Bobby, take these.
I'm looking at the gas...

1215
01:01:59,850 --> 01:02:01,151
Hey!

1216
01:02:02,419 --> 01:02:04,354
Just ditch the car,

1217
01:02:04,388 --> 01:02:06,991
Go up north, and lay low.

1218
01:02:07,024 --> 01:02:08,759
The cops will find him
in a couple of days

1219
01:02:08,793 --> 01:02:10,094
And they'll go after
the Panthers.

1220
01:02:10,127 --> 01:02:13,463
Then you can come back.

1221
01:02:13,497 --> 01:02:15,766
Were you way freaked?

1222
01:02:15,800 --> 01:02:20,170
Hey, whatever's necessary to do,
you do it.

1223
01:02:20,204 --> 01:02:22,539
Watching him
struggling to breathe,

1224
01:02:22,572 --> 01:02:26,176
And then helping him die...

1225
01:02:26,210 --> 01:02:29,479
It was amazing.

1226
01:02:35,119 --> 01:02:36,987
LINDA: They were constantly
searching the news

1227
01:02:37,021 --> 01:02:39,489
For anything
about Hinman's murder

1228
01:02:39,523 --> 01:02:43,060
And how it connected
to the Panthers.

1229
01:02:43,093 --> 01:02:45,262
Bobby got arrested.

1230
01:02:45,295 --> 01:02:47,397
Are you sure?
How do you know?

1231
01:02:47,431 --> 01:02:50,367
He was, uh, sleeping by
the side of the road.

1232
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:53,037
Cops came along, ran the plates.

1233
01:02:53,070 --> 01:02:55,105
What? It's illegal to sleep
in your car now?

1234
01:02:55,139 --> 01:02:57,875
It was Gary's car?
It was what?

1235
01:02:57,908 --> 01:03:00,878
And the knife he used.
They think it was in there.

1236
01:03:00,911 --> 01:03:02,579
That'll ruin us.

1237
01:03:02,612 --> 01:03:04,414
We still have to help him.

1238
01:03:04,448 --> 01:03:06,150
He goes down, we all do.

1239
01:03:06,183 --> 01:03:07,484
Linda!
Yes!

1240
01:03:07,517 --> 01:03:09,153
Are you gonna join
the conversation?

1241
01:03:09,186 --> 01:03:12,456
We have to tell Charlie.
Charlie's not here right now.

1242
01:03:12,489 --> 01:03:14,992
What do you mean
he's not here?

1243
01:03:15,025 --> 01:03:16,861
Charlie drove to
the Bay Area last night.

1244
01:03:16,894 --> 01:03:19,329
What if the cops come?

1245
01:03:19,363 --> 01:03:21,565
If Bobby rats us out.
Well, what about the kids?

1246
01:03:21,598 --> 01:03:23,033
He wouldn't do that.
How do you know that?

1247
01:03:23,067 --> 01:03:24,301
I'll take care of it,
all right?

1248
01:03:24,334 --> 01:03:26,570
We'll wait till

01:26:19,808 --> 01:26:22,278
[Camera shutter clicks]

1596
01:26:22,311 --> 01:26:26,215
[Laughter]

1597
01:26:26,249 --> 01:26:28,817
* Time is nothing,
love is free *

1598
01:26:28,851 --> 01:26:31,687
* Life is living,
can't you see? *

1599
01:26:31,720 --> 01:26:35,991
* Hand in hand and arm in arm
we go our separate ways *

1600
01:26:36,024 --> 01:26:40,896
* Hand in hand we always are,
I'll see you soon again *

1601
01:26:40,929 --> 01:26:45,768
* Hand in hand we always are,
I'll see you soon again *

1602
01:26:45,801 --> 01:26:48,737
*
