1
00:00:51,732 --> 00:00:55,065
Hey, Ron, is it okay if l
take off a little early today?

2
00:00:55,236 --> 00:00:58,637
l'm having dinner with my folks,
and they're way out in the suburbs, so--

3
00:00:58,806 --> 00:01:02,037
No way. Everybody gonna stay late,
do inventory tonight.

4
00:01:02,209 --> 00:01:03,471
Nobody leaves early.

5
00:01:03,644 --> 00:01:05,134
Are you kidding me?

6
00:01:05,312 --> 00:01:08,042
-But that's your job.
-Yeah, but l gotta leave early.

7
00:01:08,215 --> 00:01:13,651
l got a hot date.
With big phony jugs, the kind l like.

8
00:01:14,155 --> 00:01:17,215
That jerk. He's always doing this to us.

9
00:01:17,391 --> 00:01:19,951
Clearly this calls for drastic action.

10
00:01:26,867 --> 00:01:29,097
Okay, everybody, work's over.

11
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:33,203
- And nobody saw anything, right?
- Right!

12
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:43,072
That was great.
You're the Spartacus of us wage slaves.

13
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:45,684
Thanks. l always thought
of myself more as Popeye...

14
00:01:45,853 --> 00:01:48,617
...but Spartacus is good too.
Though it's not really fair...

15
00:01:48,789 --> 00:01:51,622
...to compare them because
they lived in different times and--

16
00:01:51,792 --> 00:01:54,955
Would you like to go out
on a date with me?

17
00:01:55,129 --> 00:01:58,223
Yeah. Sure. Yeah, l'd love to.

18
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:01,061
How about Saturday?
My roommates and l are having a party.

19
00:02:01,235 --> 00:02:04,602
Would you like to come as my date
instead of as my coworker?

20
00:02:04,772 --> 00:02:08,503
So when you put the moves on me
it won't be sexual harassment?

21
00:02:08,676 --> 00:02:11,270
-Exactly.
-lt's a date.

22
00:02:32,333 --> 00:02:33,891
Hey, look out.

23
00:02:43,511 --> 00:02:47,845
- Hey, wanna buy an air conditioner?
- No, thanks.

24
00:02:51,652 --> 00:02:53,244
Sit still, please.

25
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:55,718
-Calm down.
-Hey, Natalie.

26
00:02:55,890 --> 00:02:58,188
-You want some help with those?
-Thanks, yeah.

27
00:02:58,359 --> 00:03:01,726
Carlos and l have just been exhausted
lately with the baby's schedule...

28
00:03:01,896 --> 00:03:04,091
-...and the noise in this building.
-l know.

29
00:03:04,265 --> 00:03:08,133
l could barely get to sleep with
the sound of Gus and Wally fighting.

30
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:15,472
What are you looking at? We made up.

31
00:03:15,643 --> 00:03:18,237
Sorry about all the brouhaha last night.

32
00:03:18,412 --> 00:03:21,779
You been in a relationship this long,
you're bound to have a few beefs.

33
00:03:21,949 --> 00:03:25,908
We'd have a few less beefs if someone
would learn to pick up after himself.

34
00:03:26,086 --> 00:03:28,520
l said l would use the hamper. Enough!

35
00:03:33,294 --> 00:03:36,058
Posey? Jim? Anybody home?

36
00:03:37,498 --> 00:03:38,726
Jim!

37
00:03:43,037 --> 00:03:45,028
-Hello?
-Down here.

38
00:03:45,206 --> 00:03:47,868
Oh, hey. What's going on?

39
00:03:48,309 --> 00:03:52,040
Wanna drive me to my parents' house?
They're moving, l have to pick up the dog.

40
00:03:52,446 --> 00:03:54,505
Right, your dog.

41
00:03:54,682 --> 00:03:57,617
Hey, does he still get drunk
like when we were in high school?

42
00:03:58,152 --> 00:04:01,553
Are you kidding? Dad had to spray
the liquor cabinet with dog repellent.

43
00:04:02,556 --> 00:04:04,786
l'll get the keys.

44
00:04:08,329 --> 00:04:09,853
What happened to the couch?

45
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:12,123
We moved it over there last week,
remember?

46
00:04:12,299 --> 00:04:14,062
Oh, yeah.

47
00:04:15,302 --> 00:04:17,395
So the family's moving?

48
00:04:17,571 --> 00:04:21,337
-Your little brother too?
-Kevin? Oh, yes.

49
00:04:21,508 --> 00:04:23,499
He'll be 1 000 miles away.

50
00:04:23,677 --> 00:04:27,169
Did you know he had a T-shirt
made with his SAT scores on it?

51
00:04:27,348 --> 00:04:29,509
-How did he do?
-l don't know.

52
00:04:29,683 --> 00:04:31,981
l don't care. l didn't look.

53
00:04:32,853 --> 00:04:34,115
Much better than me.

54
00:04:35,122 --> 00:04:37,454
Well, l'm pretty excited
about this transfer.

55
00:04:37,625 --> 00:04:40,253
Wyoming may seem civilized
these days...

56
00:04:40,427 --> 00:04:45,393
...but when it comes to direct mail marketing,
it's still the Wild West.

57
00:04:45,566 --> 00:04:46,931
Awesome.

58
00:04:47,101 --> 00:04:48,762
What about Kevin? lsn't he eating?

59
00:04:48,936 --> 00:04:51,530
He's busy packing. He'll be--

60
00:04:51,906 --> 00:04:55,308
Stogie, down.
Stogie, down.

61
00:04:55,476 --> 00:04:58,536
You wanna go back in the basement?
You wanna go back in the basement?

62
00:04:58,712 --> 00:05:01,681
Jeez, Mom! His brains are
damaged enough as it is!

63
00:05:01,849 --> 00:05:05,046
Come here, boy. lt's okay.

64
00:05:05,219 --> 00:05:08,154
We're gonna have so much fun
in the city together.

65
00:05:08,322 --> 00:05:10,051
No more mean Mom and Dad.

66
00:05:10,224 --> 00:05:13,625
l'm gonna take care of you
all by myself.

67
00:05:14,194 --> 00:05:18,358
You know, it's funny
that you mention that because....

68
00:05:18,532 --> 00:05:21,524
-Well, would you be willing to--?
-Did you tell him yet?

69
00:05:21,702 --> 00:05:25,365
Hi, Andy. So, guys,
are we going to be roommates?

70
00:05:25,539 --> 00:05:26,801
-What?!
-Kevin, honey...

71
00:05:26,974 --> 00:05:30,273
...please go wait in the other room.
Here's some fig bars.

72
00:05:30,611 --> 00:05:32,943
Wait a minute.
You want Kevin to come live with me?

73
00:05:33,113 --> 00:05:36,241
lt'll just be till he graduates
and goes off to college.

74
00:05:36,417 --> 00:05:39,648
You see, he wasn't thrilled
about moving to Wyoming, and--

75
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:42,448
Were you ever planning
on consulting me about this?

76
00:05:42,623 --> 00:05:46,081
l have better things to do than
take care of my stupid kid brother.

77
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:49,286
A 1 460 combined SAT is not stupid.

78
00:05:49,463 --> 00:05:52,057
A dog who eats mothballs,
that's stupid.

79
00:05:52,232 --> 00:05:55,497
A dog, l might add, who you're rolling
out the freaking red carpet for!

80
00:05:55,669 --> 00:05:57,432
But your own brother, who loves you...

81
00:05:57,604 --> 00:06:00,232
...he gets a knife in the back
from Andy French!

82
00:06:00,407 --> 00:06:03,501
Look, Kevin and l
have never gotten along, and--

83
00:06:03,711 --> 00:06:07,078
Honey, we're taking the piano.
You don't need to practice anymore.

84
00:06:07,281 --> 00:06:10,444
Why would he even want to do this?

85
00:06:11,118 --> 00:06:15,353
- lt was his idea.
- He thinks you're cool.

86
00:06:16,590 --> 00:06:18,558
What? No, he doesn't.

87
00:06:18,726 --> 00:06:21,786
Oh, sure. He's always talking
about his cool big brother...

88
00:06:21,962 --> 00:06:24,021
...who moved to the city
to be a cartoonist.

89
00:06:24,198 --> 00:06:28,567
But l'm not a cartoonist yet,
l just sell waterbeds.

90
00:06:29,069 --> 00:06:30,866
Does he really think l'm cool?

91
00:06:31,038 --> 00:06:36,271
Yes, and you are cool.
You are my big cool baby cupcake.

92
00:06:37,811 --> 00:06:39,972
-Do l even have a choice?
-No, not really.

93
00:06:40,147 --> 00:06:43,583
Kevin, come in here. Andy would love
to have you come live with him.

94
00:06:43,917 --> 00:06:48,149
Son, we're very proud of you
for being so mature about--

95
00:06:48,322 --> 00:06:50,847
Crap! You did that on purpose,
you little creep.

96
00:06:51,025 --> 00:06:53,687
Well, your big feet were in the way.
Mom, he said ''crap.''

97
00:06:53,861 --> 00:06:56,091
You broke my feet
and you're not even sorry.

98
00:06:56,263 --> 00:06:58,663
You're losing your mind.
l'm getting away from you.

99
00:06:58,832 --> 00:07:00,299
Come here.

100
00:07:04,738 --> 00:07:07,434
Boys! Boys!

101
00:07:09,576 --> 00:07:11,942
Stop hitting yourself.
Why you hitting yourself?

102
00:07:12,312 --> 00:07:13,870
Get off me!

103
00:07:14,048 --> 00:07:15,379
Stop drooling on me.

104
00:07:15,549 --> 00:07:18,040
Oh, they'll be fine.

105
00:07:18,218 --> 00:07:20,880
What time do the movers get here?

106
00:07:26,927 --> 00:07:29,487
So this is Mission Hill.

107
00:07:29,663 --> 00:07:33,793
Don't get excited.
lt doesn't have anything you would like.

108
00:07:33,967 --> 00:07:35,867
Well, it looks very colorful.

109
00:07:36,036 --> 00:07:40,166
l think it's important to embrace
as many ideas and cultures as one can.

110
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:43,901
<i>-Mom, Dad, and l went to see Il Postino--
-Shut up.</i>

111
00:07:44,078 --> 00:07:47,881
- You are so lame. Shut up.
-Maybe you should shut up.

112
00:07:48,048 --> 00:07:50,642
No, you. l'm not the one who's--

113
00:07:50,818 --> 00:07:56,113
All right, you two.
l'm gonna pull this car over right now.

114
00:07:58,792 --> 00:08:01,852
What? Don't let me stop your arguing.

115
00:08:08,268 --> 00:08:11,066
Oh, my-- Away you go.

116
00:08:11,238 --> 00:08:14,605
That wolf is attacking my plant.

117
00:08:14,775 --> 00:08:17,369
Go on back to the woods now.

118
00:08:17,945 --> 00:08:20,709
Posey, that's not a wolf.
That's my dog, Stogie.

119
00:08:20,981 --> 00:08:24,508
And this is my brother, Kevin.
They're both coming to live here.

120
00:08:24,918 --> 00:08:26,852
Oh, a female roommate.

121
00:08:27,754 --> 00:08:29,779
l've never lived with a girl before.

122
00:08:29,957 --> 00:08:32,289
But l assure you
l am a perfect gentleman.

123
00:08:32,459 --> 00:08:36,520
Yes. l can tell by your inner light
that you're a good person.

124
00:08:36,697 --> 00:08:41,200
But Stogie, there are dark forces
at work within him.

125
00:08:46,874 --> 00:08:48,432
My new school.

126
00:08:48,609 --> 00:08:50,474
l smell fresh opportunities.

127
00:08:56,617 --> 00:08:59,677
Excuse me?
Could you tell me where Room 41 0 is?

128
00:08:59,853 --> 00:09:03,311
l think it's in my pants, man.
Why don't you take a look?

129
00:09:03,490 --> 00:09:05,481
l'm pretty sure it's not there.

130
00:09:05,659 --> 00:09:08,457
The ''four'' indicates
it's on the fourth floor and--

131
00:09:08,629 --> 00:09:10,460
You're wack, man.

132
00:09:10,631 --> 00:09:13,498
Okay. Have a good time
at the ski tournament.

133
00:09:13,767 --> 00:09:17,066
Excuse me, were you asking
about Room 41 0?

134
00:09:17,237 --> 00:09:19,034
Because l'm on my way to 41 0.

135
00:09:19,206 --> 00:09:22,004
Oh, thanks. l'm Kevin.
This is my first day.

136
00:09:22,176 --> 00:09:24,804
l'm picking up something
with my ''Obviometer,'' captain:

137
00:09:24,978 --> 00:09:26,912
No duh!

138
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,980
l like that one.

139
00:09:29,583 --> 00:09:33,952
Kevin, this is George.
George has a girlfriend in Singapore.

140
00:09:34,121 --> 00:09:38,387
Singapore. At my old school l told people
l had a girlfriend in Canada...

141
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:40,993
...because it's so far away
no one could ever check.

142
00:09:41,161 --> 00:09:43,391
ls your Singapore girlfriend
the same thing?

143
00:09:43,564 --> 00:09:45,555
lt's a more believable ethnic variation.

144
00:09:45,832 --> 00:09:48,630
Stop bragging about your girlfriends!

145
00:09:48,802 --> 00:09:51,270
All right, people, settle down.

146
00:09:51,805 --> 00:09:54,638
We have a new transfer student
joining us today.

147
00:09:54,808 --> 00:09:58,005
Kevin, why don't you tell us
a little bit about yourself?

148
00:09:58,178 --> 00:10:00,646
Hello, everybody.
My name is Kevin French.

149
00:10:00,814 --> 00:10:05,080
l moved here from Briarhurst
or as you probably know it, Exit 1 8.

150
00:10:06,186 --> 00:10:09,587
l live with my brother Andy,
who is a cartoonist here in Mission Hill.

151
00:10:09,856 --> 00:10:11,983
Some of my interests are miniature golf...

152
00:10:12,226 --> 00:10:15,457
...Robert Heinlein novels
and collecting novelty neckties.

153
00:10:15,629 --> 00:10:18,792
l have an extra Dilbert tie
if any of you would like to trade.

154
00:10:22,135 --> 00:10:23,966
Okay.

155
00:10:24,137 --> 00:10:27,664
Since you all paid such close attention
to that presentation...

156
00:10:27,841 --> 00:10:30,833
...l'm sure you won't mind
taking a quiz on it!

157
00:10:31,011 --> 00:10:33,172
Take out a piece of paper.
Question one:

158
00:10:33,347 --> 00:10:36,316
What is the new student's name?

159
00:10:41,021 --> 00:10:43,512
Kicking back, eh? May l join you?

160
00:10:43,757 --> 00:10:45,725
Sure. Have a seat.

161
00:10:48,362 --> 00:10:51,388
-Did l just see you drinking?
-Yeah.

162
00:10:51,565 --> 00:10:54,898
-So? l can drink. l'm 24.
-l don't think you should drink...

163
00:10:55,068 --> 00:10:57,161
-...if you can't drink responsibly.
-What?!

164
00:10:57,337 --> 00:10:59,328
You've had too many.
You're getting abusive.

165
00:10:59,506 --> 00:11:02,942
-Will you get lost, douche bag!
-You're the one who's acting douche bag.

166
00:11:03,510 --> 00:11:04,807
You are wack.

167
00:11:06,413 --> 00:11:09,814
You don't know what either
of those words means, do you?

168
00:11:09,983 --> 00:11:13,680
You are so lame. Go away.
You've lost this fight.

169
00:11:13,854 --> 00:11:15,651
No, l haven't.

170
00:11:16,657 --> 00:11:20,218
<i>-Mom and Dad would like to speak to you.
-Honey? Is everything all right?</i>

171
00:11:24,464 --> 00:11:26,989
Well, no. No, not really.

172
00:11:27,167 --> 00:11:30,659
l don't think l can take much more of this.
Kevin is driving me nuts.

173
00:11:30,837 --> 00:11:32,805
<i>Oh, he just needs some time to adjust.</i>

174
00:11:32,973 --> 00:11:36,773
<i>Yes, I imagine your neighborhood
is a bit different than what he's used to.</i>

175
00:11:36,943 --> 00:11:40,174
New condoms? What's wrong
with our regular brand of condoms?

176
00:11:40,347 --> 00:11:42,975
Nothing, but these were on special,
that's all.

177
00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:47,684
You cheap gay bastard.
These things are gonna fly right off!

178
00:11:48,622 --> 00:11:50,954
l'm just glad we snuck out
without running into--

179
00:11:51,124 --> 00:11:52,887
Well, hello.
Where are you guys going?

180
00:11:53,226 --> 00:11:55,285
-Nowhere.
-We're going over to Backwash...

181
00:11:55,462 --> 00:11:58,829
...to see Silly Rabbit.
They're a ska band.

182
00:11:59,566 --> 00:12:01,500
l don't think l've heard ska before.

183
00:12:01,668 --> 00:12:04,762
-Do the Beatles do any ska?
-No. And neither does Scott Joplin...

184
00:12:04,938 --> 00:12:07,372
...or Gordon Lightfoot
or any of your other ''faves.''

185
00:12:07,574 --> 00:12:10,202
Well, if you like it,
l'm sure it's interesting.

186
00:12:10,377 --> 00:12:13,005
-May l come along?
-Sure.

187
00:12:15,482 --> 00:12:18,144
No one under 21 is allowed.
l'd better go home.

188
00:12:18,318 --> 00:12:23,786
Don't worry about that. Everything
will be fine if you just stay cool.

189
00:12:24,257 --> 00:12:26,054
Okay.

190
00:12:28,061 --> 00:12:32,430
l shouldn't be in here. l feel guilty.
l'm in here under false pretenses.

191
00:12:32,599 --> 00:12:35,727
Sit still and stop attracting attention.

192
00:12:35,902 --> 00:12:37,335
But what if they ask for my lD?

193
00:12:37,504 --> 00:12:40,098
l could get arrested.
l'll never get into a good college.

194
00:12:40,273 --> 00:12:44,232
-All because l wanted to hear ska!
-Crap! Now the bouncer's coming over.

195
00:12:44,411 --> 00:12:46,641
Be cool, or you're gonna
get us all kicked out.

196
00:12:46,813 --> 00:12:49,247
Good evening, gentlemen.
l see some lD there, sir?

197
00:12:51,084 --> 00:12:53,018
How flattering you should ask.

198
00:12:53,186 --> 00:12:56,519
Ever since l shaved my beard,
everyone has been--

199
00:12:56,690 --> 00:12:58,248
Sir, if you're not 21 ...

200
00:12:58,425 --> 00:13:02,020
-...l'm gonna have to ask you--
-lt's happening! Please don't arrest me!

201
00:13:02,195 --> 00:13:05,631
l wanna go to Yale or Amherst!
Don't call my mother. l didn't know!

202
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:08,334
He made me do it!

203
00:13:17,711 --> 00:13:20,202
Well, congratulations, you little dork.

204
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:22,348
You've ruined my life
in less than a week.

205
00:13:22,516 --> 00:13:25,383
-l didn't--
-Shut up! l did you a big favor...

206
00:13:25,552 --> 00:13:27,144
...by letting you move in with me.

207
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:29,845
You should be down on your knees,
kissing my ass!

208
00:13:30,023 --> 00:13:33,049
Oops, l'm sorry, l said ''ass.''

209
00:13:33,226 --> 00:13:36,684
Please tattle on me.
Please give me a preachy speech.

210
00:13:36,863 --> 00:13:39,832
Won't you show me the way,
Reverend Goody McFreaking-Gumdrops?

211
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,867
-Mom and Dad said--
-Mom and Dad aren't here.

212
00:13:43,036 --> 00:13:46,301
They're 1 000 miles away.
Why don't you take advantage of that?

213
00:13:46,473 --> 00:13:50,671
Stop ruining my fun and have
some for yourself, for God's sake.

214
00:13:52,012 --> 00:13:53,843
You're right.

215
00:13:54,147 --> 00:13:56,775
That's the first time you've ever said
l was right.

216
00:13:56,950 --> 00:14:00,044
That's the first time you've
ever been right about anything.

217
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:04,418
But seriously, it's time l start
taking advantage of all this freedom...

218
00:14:04,591 --> 00:14:07,059
...do things l could never do
with Mom and Dad around.

219
00:14:07,227 --> 00:14:08,694
That's the spirit!

220
00:14:08,862 --> 00:14:12,491
Good. Now let's get home
so l can start masturbating.

221
00:14:22,576 --> 00:14:26,639
Kevin, is everything okay?
Are you sick or something?

222
00:14:26,813 --> 00:14:29,577
No. l stayed up until 4:30 last night.

223
00:14:30,517 --> 00:14:33,509
-Mast--?
-No. Just researching how to be cool.

224
00:14:33,687 --> 00:14:35,780
The lnternet's not as helpful
as you'd think.

225
00:14:35,956 --> 00:14:37,651
Kevin! Oh, my goodness.

226
00:14:37,824 --> 00:14:41,783
-What's happened to your inner light?
-What? ls it stained or something?

227
00:14:41,962 --> 00:14:46,831
Well, no-- Well, no, but it's become
dim and venal and wicked.

228
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,524
Like Andy's.

229
00:14:48,702 --> 00:14:51,865
Way to go, Kev. You burned out
your inner light in one evening.

230
00:14:52,038 --> 00:14:54,438
lmagine what we can
accomplish this weekend.

231
00:14:57,143 --> 00:14:59,771
l'm really looking forward
to your party tomorrow.

232
00:14:59,946 --> 00:15:03,975
Oh, me too. We deserve a break
from this frenzied go-go...

233
00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:06,618
...corporate rat race.

234
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:08,881
Ron's Waterbed World.

235
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:10,454
Yes, this is Andy French.

236
00:15:10,624 --> 00:15:13,752
Hey, idiot, no personal calls.

237
00:15:14,261 --> 00:15:16,593
Kevin? Yes, he's my brother.

238
00:15:16,763 --> 00:15:19,391
No way! Are you sure?

239
00:15:19,566 --> 00:15:23,234
Yes. Okay.
l'll be right down.

240
00:15:31,878 --> 00:15:35,336
Mr. French, l've called you here
because Kevin was caught sleeping...

241
00:15:35,515 --> 00:15:38,643
...during his fourth period
AP Chemistry class.

242
00:15:38,818 --> 00:15:42,549
When awakened, he flew into a rage
and called the teacher a--

243
00:15:42,722 --> 00:15:44,314
A graphic expletive.

244
00:15:45,525 --> 00:15:49,154
-A what?
-A foul term. This.

245
00:15:49,329 --> 00:15:51,229
This is what he called his teacher.

246
00:15:55,268 --> 00:15:58,499
Sir! l don't know how you did
things in the suburbs...

247
00:15:58,672 --> 00:16:01,573
...but we don't use those words
here in the inner city.

248
00:16:01,908 --> 00:16:03,500
l'm-- l'm sorry. l've just--

249
00:16:03,677 --> 00:16:07,010
-l've never seen it written so neatly.
-Oh, my.

250
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:09,614
Perhaps l should just call
your parents in Wyoming...

251
00:16:09,783 --> 00:16:11,444
...and discuss discipline with them.

252
00:16:11,618 --> 00:16:13,415
-No! That won't be necessary!
-Crap, no.

253
00:16:13,587 --> 00:16:15,612
Please, l'll punish him. l promise.

254
00:16:15,855 --> 00:16:20,617
l'm gonna give you some serious
discipline... young man.

255
00:16:20,794 --> 00:16:24,821
See that you do. Kevin is suspended
for the rest of today.

256
00:16:31,538 --> 00:16:34,996
l'm glad you got suspended. l could never
carry all this booze home myself.

257
00:16:35,175 --> 00:16:38,144
Will you buy this for me?
l want to have some beer at the party.

258
00:16:38,311 --> 00:16:41,940
Now you're drinking? You're serious
about this new attitude, huh?

259
00:16:42,115 --> 00:16:45,050
-Yes.
-Excellent. l was afraid you'd wuss out.

260
00:16:45,218 --> 00:16:48,483
But drinking shows a real commitment
to becoming a cooler person.

261
00:16:48,755 --> 00:16:52,384
-So will you buy me this?
-Sure, but that's olive oil.

262
00:16:54,094 --> 00:16:56,324
That's maple syrup. That's shampoo.

263
00:16:56,496 --> 00:16:59,329
Look, if you want a good first beer,
try Gruberhof.

264
00:16:59,499 --> 00:17:01,490
That's what l started with.

265
00:17:10,477 --> 00:17:14,646
Hey, guys.
Welcome to party central.

266
00:17:14,814 --> 00:17:16,076
You dudes want a beer?

267
00:17:16,383 --> 00:17:20,581
-No, thanks. Drinking is for waste-oids.
-We don't need liquor to have fun.

268
00:17:20,754 --> 00:17:23,621
<i>Not when we have the
Babylon 5 Collectible Card Game.</i>

269
00:17:29,796 --> 00:17:32,230
-Hey, great apartment.
-Thanks.

270
00:17:32,399 --> 00:17:35,562
There's a rumor that Sid Vicious
once threw up in the bathtub.

271
00:17:35,735 --> 00:17:37,293
-Bitchen!
-Hello.

272
00:17:37,470 --> 00:17:40,735
Oh, hi, you must be Kevin.
How do you like Mission Hill so far?

273
00:17:41,241 --> 00:17:43,072
lt's far out. l--

274
00:17:43,243 --> 00:17:45,609
Oh, l-- Excuse me. l'll be right back.

275
00:17:46,112 --> 00:17:48,012
Hey, man. Lay off the Gruberhof.

276
00:17:48,181 --> 00:17:51,014
-That's my private reserve.
-Who the hell are you?

277
00:17:51,317 --> 00:17:54,684
l'm the Grubermeister.
And that's all you need to know.

278
00:17:54,854 --> 00:17:58,290
Now get out of here
before l kick your ass.

279
00:17:58,458 --> 00:17:59,447
That's right.

280
00:17:59,726 --> 00:18:01,557
Those are some of my cartoons.

281
00:18:01,728 --> 00:18:06,062
And those are some designs for an
animated TV series l was thinking about.

282
00:18:06,232 --> 00:18:09,724
Oh, God. Not another animated series.

283
00:18:09,903 --> 00:18:13,304
l know. lt's like everyone
and their brother has one now.

284
00:18:22,816 --> 00:18:25,410
-Hey.
-Yeah.

285
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:36,895
And l know you're gay, okay?
But, like, l don't even have a problem with it.

286
00:18:37,130 --> 00:18:40,759
-All right already.
-Because history is full of great homos.

287
00:18:40,934 --> 00:18:45,866
Oscar Wilde was a homo.
Alexander the Great was a homo.

288
00:18:46,039 --> 00:18:47,666
And you know who else is great?

289
00:18:47,841 --> 00:18:51,208
-You, you big homo.
-That is a hurtful term.

290
00:18:51,377 --> 00:18:54,505
Please stop using it,
or l will be forced to clobber you.

291
00:19:02,355 --> 00:19:03,982
Bite me.

292
00:19:04,457 --> 00:19:08,621
All right!
Everybody ska!

293
00:19:14,167 --> 00:19:15,759
Hey...

294
00:19:16,302 --> 00:19:20,602
...who wants to get it on
with the Grubermeister, huh?

295
00:19:21,341 --> 00:19:22,638
You do.

296
00:19:31,284 --> 00:19:34,651
-That sounds like Kevin.
-l'm sure he's asleep by now. Come on.

297
00:19:39,659 --> 00:19:40,887
That is Kevin.

298
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:44,655
Well, he's probably a little drunk.
Forget about it.

299
00:19:44,831 --> 00:19:47,095
l'd feel better if l could just check.

300
00:19:52,438 --> 00:19:54,065
Well, l do not feel better.

301
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:57,505
You will in a second. l promise.

302
00:20:09,122 --> 00:20:12,849
l'm sorry.
He's my brother.

303
00:20:17,497 --> 00:20:18,691
What's he saying?

304
00:20:18,865 --> 00:20:22,596
He's saying he's the Grubermeister.
Do any of you have a problem with that?

305
00:20:22,769 --> 00:20:24,259
-No, sir.
-Not at all.

306
00:20:24,437 --> 00:20:27,429
Good. Now l think
it's time for you to leave.

307
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:29,435
See you later.

308
00:20:30,009 --> 00:20:34,105
Hey, Andy.
This apartment sure spins a lot.

309
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:38,808
Yeah.
lt tends to do that after a good party.

310
00:20:43,356 --> 00:20:45,324
l'm sorry for being so pathetic.

311
00:20:45,592 --> 00:20:49,494
Hey, cheer up. lt's not everybody
who can outdo Sid Vicious.

312
00:20:49,662 --> 00:20:52,222
-Here you go. ls everything okay?
-Yeah.

313
00:20:52,398 --> 00:20:55,834
-He just got a little carried away is all.
-lt runs in the family.

314
00:20:56,202 --> 00:21:01,003
Every time somebody put down a cup,
your dog ran up and drank it.

315
00:21:03,276 --> 00:21:06,609
Well, l better get going.
See you tomorrow.

316
00:21:08,348 --> 00:21:11,806
Well, l guess my experiment
in being cool has failed.

317
00:21:12,385 --> 00:21:14,979
-Miserably.
-So you're gonna call it quits?

318
00:21:15,154 --> 00:21:18,954
lt's too hard being like you.
l don't know if l can do it.

319
00:21:19,125 --> 00:21:21,992
Maybe you'd be happier
just being the old Kevin?

320
00:21:22,161 --> 00:21:24,629
Well, it's certainly the easy choice.

321
00:21:24,797 --> 00:21:27,163
ls the douche-bag aspect
going to be a problem?

322
00:21:27,467 --> 00:21:28,900
l can learn to live with it.

323
00:21:29,369 --> 00:21:33,203
Thanks. And let's just try
to forget about last night.

324
00:21:33,373 --> 00:21:36,740
Oh, God. At least Mom and Dad
will never find out.

325
00:21:36,976 --> 00:21:39,444
<i>Sunday, 3:30 a.m.</i>

326
00:21:39,612 --> 00:21:42,172
