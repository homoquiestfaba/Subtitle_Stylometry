02:01:41,157 --> 02:01:43,819
[Music] Pretty woman [Music]

1749
02:01:43,893 --> 02:01:47,590
[Music] I don't believe you
You're not the truth [Music]

1750
02:01:47,663 --> 02:01:52,327
[Music] No one could look
as good as you [Music]

[Music] You really took me
by surprise [Music]

[Music] You're someone
I've needed for a lifetime [Music]

1760
02:02:53,863 --> 02:02:57,492
[Music] Your heart
was cleverly disguised [Music]

1761
02:03:00,803 --> 02:03:05,536
[Music] And it didn't look that way
in my mind [Music]

1762
02:03:05,608 --> 02:03:08,634
[Music] Tell me
how could it be [Music]

[Music] Darlin', I couldn't read
what was in your mind [Music]

1765
02:03:17,486 --> 02:03:21,013
[Music] To turn around and love me [Music]

02:03:21,090 --> 02:03:24,082
[Music] With no [Music]

1767
02:03:24,160 --> 02:03:27,061
[Music] Explanation [Music]

1768
02:03:27,129 --> 02:03:30,860
[Music] I gave you everything I have [Music]

1769
02:03:30,933 --> 02:03:34,892
[Music] I didn't know
that you would take it [Music]

02:03:34,970 --> 02:03:39,998
[Music] With sweet consideration [Music]

1771
02:03:41,343 --> 02:03:45,439
[Music] And after all
that we've been through [Music]

1772
02:03:45,514 --> 02:03:48,677
[Music] I can't believe it's true [Music]

1773
02:03:48,751 --> 02:03:53,245
[Music] Until I hear you say [Music]

[Music] No explanation [Music]

1778
02:04:26,689 --> 02:04:30,318
[Music] I gave you everything I have [Music]

1779
02:04:30,392 --> 02:04:34,889
[Music] I didn't know
that you would take it [Music][Music]
