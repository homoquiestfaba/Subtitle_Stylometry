1
00:03:16,391 --> 00:03:18,621
Fuu...

2
00:03:21,997 --> 00:03:24,898
...uuck!

3
00:04:06,574 --> 00:04:08,439
Hello, gorgeous.

4
00:04:26,561 --> 00:04:27,619
Jesus.

5
00:04:27,696 --> 00:04:30,324
I wish someone could
tell me how to just once

6
00:04:30,398 --> 00:04:32,662
wake up without
a splitting headache.

7
00:04:32,734 --> 00:04:34,224
You could drink less.

8
00:04:34,302 --> 00:04:37,271
Thank you, Coco.
That's very helpful.

9
00:04:42,077 --> 00:04:43,339
Place looks nice.

10
00:04:43,411 --> 00:04:46,847
Yes. We were both getting up
early to clean it today, remember?

11
00:04:46,915 --> 00:04:49,008
I'd have just gotten in the way.

12
00:04:49,084 --> 00:04:52,485
You did get in the way.
That's why I moved you to your bed.

13
00:04:52,554 --> 00:04:53,851
Evie.

14
00:04:59,861 --> 00:05:00,885
Yeah?

15
00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:04,897
What do you think about the idea
of having a dog in the house?

16
00:05:04,966 --> 00:05:07,833
I'm sorry.
Have I been staring?

17
00:05:09,037 --> 00:05:10,527
I'm thinking of getting one.

18
00:05:10,605 --> 00:05:14,200
At this point, I'm probably
never gonna have kids.

19
00:05:14,275 --> 00:05:17,733
Coco, it's not too late.

20
00:05:17,812 --> 00:05:18,870
I'm kidding!

21
00:05:19,781 --> 00:05:21,180
A dog sounds fun.

22
00:05:21,249 --> 00:05:23,979
It sounds depressing,
is what it sounds.

23
00:05:24,052 --> 00:05:25,485
"Do you have kids?"

24
00:05:25,553 --> 00:05:27,043
"No, but I have a dog. "

25
00:05:27,122 --> 00:05:30,523
"Well, it's the same thing,
you crazy, barren old hag. "

26
00:05:30,592 --> 00:05:33,322
This new roommate
will cheer you right up.

27
00:05:33,394 --> 00:05:35,726
I just hope
she's not too loud.

28
00:05:35,797 --> 00:05:36,957
Or happy.

29
00:05:37,031 --> 00:05:39,329
Happy people
always make such a racket.

30
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:41,960
She came by,
and she was a peach.

31
00:05:42,036 --> 00:05:44,527
- Were you drunk?
- It was 12 noon.

32
00:05:44,606 --> 00:05:46,369
Of course I was drunk.

33
00:05:46,441 --> 00:05:49,933
I'm surprised anybody would rent
that awful Bicentennial room.

34
00:05:52,447 --> 00:05:53,709
What?

35
00:05:53,782 --> 00:05:55,841
I rented Varla yourr room.

36
00:05:55,917 --> 00:05:58,408
- What?
- You'll be the one in the...

37
00:06:00,255 --> 00:06:01,847
...in the Bicentennial room.

38
00:06:01,923 --> 00:06:04,721
Evie, I have seniority.

39
00:06:04,793 --> 00:06:06,021
Bet that's her.

40
00:06:06,094 --> 00:06:08,790
All you do
is take advantage of me.

41
00:06:08,863 --> 00:06:11,127
And I'm not gonna
take it anymore.

42
00:06:14,869 --> 00:06:17,463
Ooh, she's a happy one.

43
00:06:17,539 --> 00:06:20,303
Hello! You must be Yoo Hoo.

44
00:06:20,375 --> 00:06:21,467
Coco.

45
00:06:21,543 --> 00:06:24,137
- I'm Varla.
- Hello, Varla.

46
00:06:24,212 --> 00:06:26,476
Let me help you
with your duffel bag.

47
00:06:28,383 --> 00:06:30,146
My things are in the Cabriolet.

48
00:06:30,218 --> 00:06:33,984
Oh, I'm sorry.
That's just your ass.

49
00:06:42,463 --> 00:06:44,488
Jesus Christ!

50
00:06:45,567 --> 00:06:48,229
Well, this is the backyard.

51
00:06:49,904 --> 00:06:51,337
You have a pool?

52
00:06:53,508 --> 00:06:56,966
Nothing like that first
puke of the day! Martini?

53
00:06:57,045 --> 00:06:59,673
Happy hour for me
never starts till after five.

54
00:06:59,747 --> 00:07:02,443
Me either.
This is only number three.

55
00:07:03,351 --> 00:07:08,118
Varla was just telling me
how she came here from Arkansas.

56
00:07:08,189 --> 00:07:10,282
Right. To become
a big movie star.

57
00:07:10,358 --> 00:07:12,053
And singing sensation.

58
00:07:13,228 --> 00:07:16,129
Well, you know, it's not
as simple as just showing up.

59
00:07:16,197 --> 00:07:18,392
You also have to
fill out the application.

60
00:07:19,434 --> 00:07:23,370
I realize how tough it can be.
But that's why I have a plan.

61
00:07:23,905 --> 00:07:27,033
I'm gonna spend every afternoon
at Schwab's Drugstore.

62
00:07:27,542 --> 00:07:30,943
You know, where
Tina Turner was discovered.

63
00:07:31,779 --> 00:07:34,339
Except it's
a Virgin Megastore now.

64
00:07:34,415 --> 00:07:36,144
Are people
still discovered there?

65
00:07:36,217 --> 00:07:39,186
Yes, but mainly in the men's room
by undercover cops.

66
00:07:39,254 --> 00:07:41,484
You know,
her plan could work.

67
00:07:41,556 --> 00:07:43,353
When I was first starting out,

68
00:07:43,424 --> 00:07:45,984
I ran into Fred MacMurray
at the Brown Derby

69
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:48,392
just when they were
casting Flubberr.

70
00:07:48,463 --> 00:07:52,297
We hit it off so well,
he threw a juicy part my way.

71
00:07:52,367 --> 00:07:54,130
Then he put you
in the movie.

72
00:07:54,202 --> 00:07:58,502
Well, I hate to brag,
but acting is sort of in my blood.

73
00:07:58,573 --> 00:08:02,100
You see,
my mother was Marla Simonds.

74
00:08:03,378 --> 00:08:05,346
- 'Cause of her!
- I can't finish this.

75
00:08:06,948 --> 00:08:09,007
Your mother
was Marla Simonds?

76
00:08:09,083 --> 00:08:10,448
Chesty on Fill Herr Up.

77
00:08:10,518 --> 00:08:13,578
the short-lived but widely acclaimed
summer spin-off of CPO Slharrkey.

78
00:08:13,655 --> 00:08:15,555
Damn it.
That was a lot of martini.

79
00:08:15,623 --> 00:08:18,615
- Did you know her?
- Goodness, yes.

80
00:08:18,693 --> 00:08:21,992
We were always running
into each other at auditions.

81
00:08:22,063 --> 00:08:24,463
She had such
a bright future, too.

82
00:08:24,532 --> 00:08:27,399
We were all so shocked
when she offed herself.

83
00:08:27,468 --> 00:08:29,265
- Evie!
- I'm sorry.

84
00:08:29,337 --> 00:08:30,861
Passed herself away.

85
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:35,204
They shipped me off
to Arkansas right after, so I...

86
00:08:36,878 --> 00:08:38,402
I have so many questions.

87
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:40,413
- What was she like?
- Very sweet.

88
00:08:40,481 --> 00:08:43,075
- And a big pothead.
- Evie!

89
00:08:43,151 --> 00:08:44,709
Loved cock.

90
00:08:44,786 --> 00:08:46,686
Coco is sexophobic.

91
00:08:46,754 --> 00:08:50,315
- Did you ever work with her?
- No, but you know what?

92
00:08:50,391 --> 00:08:53,224
She almost got my
breakthrough role in Asterroid.

93
00:08:53,861 --> 00:08:56,091
Still, there were never
any hard feelings.

94
00:08:56,164 --> 00:08:58,997
She even came to the big
housewarming party I threw

95
00:08:59,067 --> 00:09:01,797
to help my friends
celebrate my success.

96
00:09:07,342 --> 00:09:10,778
My mother... was here?

97
00:09:10,845 --> 00:09:12,574
Everyone was.

98
00:09:12,647 --> 00:09:15,445
Marla, Rip Taylor...
everyone.

99
00:09:15,950 --> 00:09:17,679
You know what?

100
00:09:18,953 --> 00:09:21,547
I think the universe
sent me here for a reason.

101
00:09:21,622 --> 00:09:26,286
It's telling me I'm supposed to
follow in my mother's footsteps.

102
00:09:27,695 --> 00:09:29,822
If I can become
a big movie star,

103
00:09:29,897 --> 00:09:34,766
then maybe in a way, her life
wouldn't have been for nothing.

104
00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:37,367
How do you figure?

105
00:10:01,729 --> 00:10:03,492
Piece of shit.

106
00:10:06,067 --> 00:10:08,331
Evie, help!

107
00:10:25,987 --> 00:10:27,147
Hi.

108
00:10:27,221 --> 00:10:30,054
I didn't realize you knew
this room still existed.

109
00:10:30,124 --> 00:10:32,354
I come in here plenty.

110
00:10:33,261 --> 00:10:34,353
Look.

111
00:10:34,429 --> 00:10:38,525
Cher Allman decided
to drop her last name altogether.

112
00:10:38,599 --> 00:10:41,898
With that new girl in the house,
I've got to keep up.

113
00:10:41,969 --> 00:10:45,200
Three hours in,
and you're already competing.

114
00:10:45,273 --> 00:10:48,299
- Just like with her mom.
- That's not what this is!

115
00:10:48,376 --> 00:10:50,105
Oh, my God!

116
00:11:31,619 --> 00:11:32,779
What?

117
00:11:34,822 --> 00:11:38,952
Oh, Evie,
when I was at Vassar,

118
00:11:39,026 --> 00:11:43,360
I became... with child...

119
00:11:43,431 --> 00:11:44,762
and I had a...

120
00:11:45,766 --> 00:11:47,427
...procedure.

121
00:11:48,102 --> 00:11:51,697
Tlhat's your big secret?
An abortion?

122
00:11:51,772 --> 00:11:54,400
- Have you had one?
- One?

123
00:11:54,475 --> 00:11:58,468
I've had more children pulled
out of me than a burning orphanage.

124
00:11:59,013 --> 00:12:02,710
Well, anyway, there's more.

125
00:12:08,022 --> 00:12:10,047
I was still
very young myself,

126
00:12:10,124 --> 00:12:13,651
so, needless to say,
I was quite nervous.

127
00:12:13,728 --> 00:12:15,127
But, Evie,

128
00:12:15,196 --> 00:12:19,292
when that doctor walked in.
- my fear -melted like...

129
00:12:19,367 --> 00:12:21,665
snow in a... -melter.

130
00:12:21,736 --> 00:12:23,465
So, is this your first abortion?

131
00:12:24,906 --> 00:12:26,066
Yeah.

132
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:28,301
He was confident and kind...

133
00:12:28,376 --> 00:12:30,003
There you go.

134
00:12:30,077 --> 00:12:32,978
- And I know this souds crazy...
- Yeah, hold still.

135
00:12:33,047 --> 00:12:35,743
...but even
in ourr brrief ti-me togetlherr.

136
00:12:35,816 --> 00:12:37,579
I felt our souls touclh.

137
00:12:37,652 --> 00:12:39,483
It's over?

138
00:12:39,554 --> 00:12:41,681
Afterwards.
I tried to -make contact.

139
00:12:41,756 --> 00:12:44,691
but tlhey didn't give out na-mes
on account of all tlhe slhootings.

140
00:12:44,759 --> 00:12:47,193
I must have the doctor's name!

141
00:12:47,261 --> 00:12:51,357
All I knew was
Ihe worked on Tuesdays.

142
00:12:52,266 --> 00:12:53,858
- And. Evie...
- Young man.

143
00:12:53,935 --> 00:12:56,495
...tlhat's wlhen I Ihatclhed
- my evil plan.

144
00:12:56,571 --> 00:12:59,870
- You're on the pill, right?
- Of course I am.

145
00:12:59,941 --> 00:13:01,568
Think I want
to get pregnant?

146
00:13:01,642 --> 00:13:03,439
I took on all comers-

147
00:13:03,511 --> 00:13:05,706
class-mates. teaclhers...

148
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:07,839
- ... -my priest.
- You're going straight to hell!

149
00:13:07,915 --> 00:13:10,816
My reputation went
into a tailspin. but I didn't care.

150
00:13:10,885 --> 00:13:13,513
I was a wo-man obsessed.

151
00:13:13,588 --> 00:13:17,149
Tlhen one -morning-
a Tuesday. if you believe in fate...

152
00:13:17,225 --> 00:13:20,956
I ran to that clinic so fast.
I'm lucky I didn't -miscarry.

153
00:13:21,028 --> 00:13:22,996
Time had only -made him
- more handsome.

154
00:13:23,064 --> 00:13:25,396
Look who it is.
My favorite patient.

155
00:13:25,466 --> 00:13:27,195
I smiled at him.

156
00:13:27,268 --> 00:13:28,667
He smiled back.

157
00:13:28,736 --> 00:13:31,170
And. Evie.
tlhat's wlhen I saw it-

158
00:13:31,239 --> 00:13:32,797
Ihe Ihad goTTen -married.

159
00:13:32,873 --> 00:13:33,999
What's wrong?

160
00:13:34,075 --> 00:13:35,804
- I was so distrauglht.
- Nothing.

161
00:13:35,876 --> 00:13:37,639
I couldn't even enjoy
our inti-macy.

162
00:13:37,712 --> 00:13:39,043
Here I come.

163
00:13:40,948 --> 00:13:42,848
I'm not proud
of what I did.

164
00:13:43,751 --> 00:13:47,187
In fact, I haven't slept
through a night since.

165
00:13:48,256 --> 00:13:50,690
But when I do sleep...

166
00:13:53,261 --> 00:13:54,694
...I dream of him.

167
00:14:16,584 --> 00:14:18,518
I'll bring the rest
when you finish with that.

168
00:14:18,586 --> 00:14:19,780
Stay close.

169
00:14:25,593 --> 00:14:30,223
I saw you sitting all alone,
looking so very beautiful.

170
00:14:30,298 --> 00:14:31,822
Thank you.

171
00:14:33,367 --> 00:14:35,528
My apology
for being so bold,

172
00:14:35,603 --> 00:14:39,767
but when I see the best,
I have to have it.

173
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:42,001
Well, you know...

174
00:14:42,076 --> 00:14:44,909
a Maserati needs much more
pampering than a Toyota.

175
00:14:44,979 --> 00:14:46,674
This is not a problem

176
00:14:46,747 --> 00:14:50,808
if the Maserati will take
its driver where he wants to go.

177
00:14:50,885 --> 00:14:53,786
Maseratis don't do anal.

178
00:14:53,854 --> 00:14:56,186
I think we understand each other.

179
00:14:57,291 --> 00:15:00,522
So, what brings you lunching
this afternoon?

180
00:15:01,896 --> 00:15:05,297
It's not the exact malt shop
where Tina Turner was discovered

181
00:15:05,366 --> 00:15:08,961
by a big producer,
but it is the closest one to it...

182
00:15:09,537 --> 00:15:10,970
...that had apple crumble.

183
00:15:12,006 --> 00:15:16,375
Do you know that
I am movie producer?

184
00:15:19,513 --> 00:15:20,639
Really?

185
00:15:24,552 --> 00:15:29,148
Where on earth did you
produce that charming accent?

186
00:15:29,223 --> 00:15:30,815
Bulgrapulatvinskerbina.

187
00:15:30,891 --> 00:15:31,983
Waiter!

188
00:15:35,196 --> 00:15:39,155
Yes, Bulgrapulatvinskerbinians,
we do not bathe.

189
00:15:39,233 --> 00:15:40,791
Can't tell.

190
00:15:40,868 --> 00:15:44,998
But that does remind me,
I should refreshen my perfume.

191
00:15:48,442 --> 00:15:50,000
So I said, "Why am I laughing?

192
00:15:50,077 --> 00:15:53,012
We're doing it doggy style,
and your name is Barker. "

193
00:15:54,749 --> 00:15:57,843
That used to be
George Peppard's house.

194
00:15:57,918 --> 00:15:59,351
Great lay.

195
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:02,617
But talk about loud-
they knew he was coming in Oxnard.

196
00:16:02,690 --> 00:16:04,282
Evie, I'm not sure about this.

197
00:16:04,358 --> 00:16:07,122
Coco, I've done this
a million times.

198
00:16:07,194 --> 00:16:09,628
- This sounds dangerous.
- Dangerous?

199
00:16:09,697 --> 00:16:12,131
Coco, I slam on the brakes,

200
00:16:12,199 --> 00:16:14,133
the poor sap
behind us doesn't,

201
00:16:14,201 --> 00:16:15,964
then this quack I know
says we're injured,

202
00:16:16,036 --> 00:16:19,301
and my ambulance-chaser son
sues them for all they're worth!

203
00:16:19,373 --> 00:16:22,968
- It's like stealing money!
- It is stealing money.

204
00:16:23,677 --> 00:16:25,542
June Allyson.

205
00:16:25,613 --> 00:16:27,979
They offered me
that commercial for Depends.

206
00:16:28,048 --> 00:16:29,538
Lot of money, too.

207
00:16:29,617 --> 00:16:32,609
Just one little problem-
I don't shit my pants.

208
00:16:32,686 --> 00:16:35,951
Plus, I want to show Poppy
his new home.

209
00:16:37,158 --> 00:16:38,648
Jackpot!

210
00:16:45,566 --> 00:16:48,535
At the time of the accident,
had you been drinking?

211
00:16:48,602 --> 00:16:50,160
No. I was sober.

212
00:16:50,237 --> 00:16:53,638
- Ma, this guy's lawyer-
- Fine! I hadn't been drinking.

213
00:16:53,707 --> 00:16:55,004
Not even one drink?

214
00:16:55,075 --> 00:16:57,236
One drink? What's that?

215
00:16:58,813 --> 00:17:00,337
I'm gonna start with Coco.

216
00:17:00,414 --> 00:17:03,144
They kept her overnight
at the hospital.

217
00:17:04,084 --> 00:17:07,383
- Is she gonna be okay?
- I hope so.

218
00:17:07,455 --> 00:17:09,446
Do we get more if she dies?

219
00:17:09,523 --> 00:17:12,617
Mom! Aunt Coco is my favorite-

220
00:17:17,731 --> 00:17:19,164
Hi.

221
00:17:21,368 --> 00:17:22,733
Varla.

222
00:17:22,803 --> 00:17:25,795
Varla!
This is my son...

223
00:17:25,873 --> 00:17:27,238
Stevie.

224
00:17:27,308 --> 00:17:29,071
- Hello, Stevie.
- Hi, Varla.

225
00:17:29,143 --> 00:17:32,806
That's a pretty name
for a pretty girl.

226
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:35,405
It's also kind of a fat name.

227
00:17:35,483 --> 00:17:37,383
Which is good, too.

228
00:17:37,451 --> 00:17:39,351
I'm glad I'm pretty,

229
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:42,446
because I'm taking
a big producer to dinner tonight.

230
00:17:42,523 --> 00:17:45,583
Maybe I'll go
on a date tonight, too.

231
00:17:45,659 --> 00:17:47,752
That guy who hit us
slipped me his number.

232
00:17:48,762 --> 00:17:51,458
He had to, Mom.
It's the law.

233
00:17:51,532 --> 00:17:54,797
Well, did he have to flirt with me
while we waited for the cops?

234
00:17:55,469 --> 00:17:58,438
He said, "Look the fuck
where you're going,

235
00:17:58,506 --> 00:17:59,905
you drunk corpse. "

236
00:17:59,974 --> 00:18:02,204
It was more
in his body language.

237
00:18:05,579 --> 00:18:08,446
I know I'm not
a big-shot producer,

238
00:18:08,516 --> 00:18:10,814
but I get jobs
for Mom sometimes.

239
00:18:10,885 --> 00:18:12,045
I don't know why you bother.

240
00:18:12,119 --> 00:18:14,849
They all run screaming
when they see your tiny dick.

241
00:18:17,691 --> 00:18:19,716
- Mom!
- What, it's not?

242
00:18:19,793 --> 00:18:22,728
The doctor changed his mind twice
before calling him a boy.

243
00:18:24,265 --> 00:18:27,928
When it comes to men,
I look for what's on the inside.

244
00:18:28,002 --> 00:18:30,197
Then you're in luck,
'cause his dick practically is.

245
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:31,431
Hi, Jeff!

246
00:18:31,505 --> 00:18:33,700
You rammed into me today,
and I want seconds.

247
00:18:47,755 --> 00:18:51,384
Why are you doing
so far from me?

248
00:18:51,458 --> 00:18:52,948
Be closer.

249
00:19:05,372 --> 00:19:09,172
Oh, yes,
this is much more romantic.

250
00:19:13,514 --> 00:19:17,416
You see that girl at the bar?
She's a whore.

251
00:19:20,554 --> 00:19:21,885
How can you tell?

252
00:19:21,956 --> 00:19:25,255
Whores are sexy.
Do you know why?

253
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:27,693
Because it's their job?

254
00:19:27,761 --> 00:19:31,754
Because they do it for love.

255
00:19:31,832 --> 00:19:34,699
Tonight she is going to give
all the money she make

256
00:19:34,768 --> 00:19:38,101
to one most very important man.

257
00:19:38,172 --> 00:19:41,005
Right, or he'll cut her.

258
00:19:41,075 --> 00:19:43,202
Also to prove that she cares.

259
00:19:43,944 --> 00:19:45,275
As a producer,

260
00:19:45,346 --> 00:19:48,213
I have many actress,
they tell me that they care.

261
00:19:48,282 --> 00:19:53,151
But a whore...
A whore prove it.

262
00:19:54,521 --> 00:19:55,852
Laurent...

263
00:19:57,091 --> 00:19:59,218
I care.

264
00:19:59,293 --> 00:20:01,386
And would you like to prove?

265
00:20:02,529 --> 00:20:04,292
Heavens, yes.

266
00:20:05,099 --> 00:20:08,091
More than I'd like to finish
those Bob Hope Nachos.

267
00:20:08,168 --> 00:20:11,467
I think we understand each other.

268
00:20:13,741 --> 00:20:15,038
Waitress!

269
00:20:18,012 --> 00:20:22,108
And I'm glad
I could coax you over.

270
00:20:22,182 --> 00:20:25,879
At first I was afraid
you'd think it a bit strange.

271
00:20:27,121 --> 00:20:28,850
Why, 'cause you're so old?

272
00:20:29,490 --> 00:20:32,425
'Cause of how we met,
silly-billy.

273
00:20:32,493 --> 00:20:35,360
- What's this?
- Let me turn it on.

274
00:20:35,429 --> 00:20:37,863
I love turning things on.

275
00:20:46,106 --> 00:20:49,234
- It's raining!
- Nice.

276
00:20:50,044 --> 00:20:52,740
I'll sell it to you for $5,000.

277
00:20:52,813 --> 00:20:54,075
That's okay.

278
00:20:54,148 --> 00:20:57,379
I'm kidding. I could never
part with it anyway...

279
00:20:57,451 --> 00:20:59,612
for less than 3,500 rock bottom.

280
00:20:59,687 --> 00:21:03,316
- You know Mary Tyler Moore?
- Very well.

281
00:21:03,390 --> 00:21:06,120
We did Niglht of
a Tlhousand Stars together.

282
00:21:06,193 --> 00:21:09,026
Funny story-
she has diabetes.

283
00:21:09,096 --> 00:21:13,362
It's always been sort of a fantasy
of mine to sleep with a big movie star.

284
00:21:13,434 --> 00:21:18,098
Well, tonight might just be
the night your fantasy comes true.

285
00:21:18,172 --> 00:21:20,140
Why? Who's coming?

286
00:21:20,207 --> 00:21:21,697
Me.

287
00:21:21,775 --> 00:21:23,367
Asteroid.

288
00:21:24,511 --> 00:21:27,412
- I'm sory, I didn't see it.
- Oh, you're the one.

289
00:21:27,981 --> 00:21:29,141
I'm kidding.

290
00:21:29,216 --> 00:21:31,081
- But BaTTlestar Galactica.
- No.

291
00:21:31,151 --> 00:21:33,176
- Tlhe Facts of Life go to Europe?
- No.

292
00:21:33,253 --> 00:21:34,345
Tabitlha!

293
00:21:34,421 --> 00:21:38,152
I just realized
tonight is my laundry night.

294
00:21:40,794 --> 00:21:43,592
Court TV.: Celebrities Wlho Kill.

295
00:21:44,364 --> 00:21:46,764
You're the Hit-and-Run
Hooch Hound!

296
00:21:49,903 --> 00:21:52,531
Cleanup in ICU.

297
00:21:54,775 --> 00:21:55,935
Hello.

298
00:21:56,610 --> 00:22:00,410
Hi. You gave us
quite a scare there...

299
00:22:00,481 --> 00:22:01,641
Coco.

300
00:22:01,715 --> 00:22:02,875
What happened?

301
00:22:02,950 --> 00:22:05,077
All I remember is this truck-

302
00:22:05,152 --> 00:22:06,585
Poppy!

303
00:22:06,653 --> 00:22:08,211
I'm sory.

304
00:22:08,822 --> 00:22:09,982
He's gone?

305
00:22:10,057 --> 00:22:12,753
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

306
00:22:12,826 --> 00:22:14,589
Didn't you get your morphine?

307
00:22:14,661 --> 00:22:18,563
No. But in fairness,
the nurse seemed really sleepy.

308
00:22:22,336 --> 00:22:25,931
Which is just as well, really,
'cause I usually don't take such strong-

309
00:22:26,006 --> 00:22:29,305
Trust me.
It's the pizza of drugs.

310
00:22:45,626 --> 00:22:47,685
Dr. Perfect?

311
00:22:55,169 --> 00:22:57,034
Patient Beautiful.

312
00:22:57,104 --> 00:22:59,231
Five bucks. Make it last.

313
00:22:59,306 --> 00:23:01,297
Thank you, sir.

314
00:23:01,375 --> 00:23:04,208
My pimp and I
appreciate your business.

315
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:13,980
So-

316
00:23:14,822 --> 00:23:17,154
Okay, enough child's play.

317
00:23:21,795 --> 00:23:23,660
Do you got any porn?

318
00:23:24,565 --> 00:23:27,898
Maybe, left over
from my husband.

319
00:23:27,968 --> 00:23:30,766
Could we, for a goof?

320
00:23:30,838 --> 00:23:33,864
Okay. It'll be
kind of old, though.

321
00:23:33,941 --> 00:23:35,101
That's fine.

322
00:23:35,175 --> 00:23:38,042
- And man-on-man.
- Anything.

323
00:23:39,913 --> 00:23:42,143
I wanted to look for you,

324
00:23:42,216 --> 00:23:45,379
but I was afraid you'd
reject me when you heard.

325
00:23:45,452 --> 00:23:46,885
Heard what?

326
00:23:46,954 --> 00:23:49,752
When I fall for a woman,

327
00:23:49,823 --> 00:23:52,383
I become her
emotional slave.

328
00:23:53,427 --> 00:23:55,156
I'll manage.

329
00:24:10,477 --> 00:24:14,208
God. I had hoped
you'd be a lifeless kisser.

330
00:24:14,882 --> 00:24:17,407
And in a few years,
when your ass begins to sag-

331
00:24:17,484 --> 00:24:21,113
But, Dr. Perfect,
it's sagging now.

332
00:24:22,356 --> 00:24:23,584
No.

333
00:24:35,235 --> 00:24:37,897
She's famous, she's famous...

334
00:24:41,174 --> 00:24:44,473
What's wrong?
Did my glass eye roll back?

335
00:24:44,544 --> 00:24:45,909
I'll fix it.

336
00:24:48,448 --> 00:24:49,938
Oh, yeah.

337
00:24:51,685 --> 00:24:52,845
She's famous.

338
00:24:54,121 --> 00:24:55,713
Oh, yeah!

339
00:25:08,869 --> 00:25:12,771
"Miss Harris. -my drinking has been
spinning out of control lately.

340
00:25:12,839 --> 00:25:16,866
"But last nignt -made -me realize
I've hit bottom and need help.

341
00:25:16,944 --> 00:25:18,536
Tlhank you. Jeff. "

342
00:25:18,612 --> 00:25:21,775
It feels so good
to make a difference.

343
00:25:25,052 --> 00:25:27,919
You promised to pick me up
at the hospital.

344
00:25:27,988 --> 00:25:31,253
I know, but I really
needed the extra sleep.

345
00:25:31,325 --> 00:25:35,352
No, I believe the phrase
you're searching for is "I'm sory. "

346
00:25:35,429 --> 00:25:37,294
You're the one
who believed me.

347
00:25:57,918 --> 00:25:59,783
Have you ever been on morphine?

348
00:26:01,722 --> 00:26:04,054
Once, when I had my eyes done.

349
00:26:04,124 --> 00:26:06,922
Then every day
for ten years after that. Why?

350
00:26:08,295 --> 00:26:10,627
It's too horible to talk about.

351
00:26:14,534 --> 00:26:17,162
- I'm in love!
- My date went great, too.

352
00:26:18,905 --> 00:26:20,463
What's wrong?

353
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:23,976
It's too horible
to talk about, thank God.

354
00:26:24,044 --> 00:26:26,410
Laurent is charming

355
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:27,674
and handsome

356
00:26:27,748 --> 00:26:29,579
and sexy.

357
00:26:30,450 --> 00:26:34,181
And he really makes me feel
like I'm worth something.

358
00:26:34,254 --> 00:26:36,051
That stain is from us.

359
00:26:37,224 --> 00:26:41,786
Plus, he is going to give me a role
in his new feature film!

360
00:26:42,829 --> 00:26:44,660
Congratu...

361
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,594
I love you. I love you.

362
00:26:47,667 --> 00:26:50,693
Phooey! I'm late
for our love game.

363
00:26:50,771 --> 00:26:52,966
Take these for the ride,
you huge cow.

364
00:26:53,874 --> 00:26:54,932
Excuse me?

365
00:26:55,008 --> 00:26:56,805
I'm kidding.

366
00:26:56,877 --> 00:26:58,208
Jesus.

367
00:27:03,850 --> 00:27:05,511
Here you go, pimpleton.

368
00:27:05,585 --> 00:27:06,847
It would have been more,

369
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:08,945
but that football team
beat me and ran.

370
00:27:09,022 --> 00:27:10,512
Get back out there.

371
00:27:10,590 --> 00:27:12,683
But I'm so sore already.

372
00:27:12,759 --> 00:27:16,195
Like my heart is sore
when you are away from me.

373
00:27:16,263 --> 00:27:19,130
Laurent, you should write
paper towels.

374
00:27:19,199 --> 00:27:20,496
Varla, you're coming with me.

375
00:27:20,567 --> 00:27:22,364
This is none
of your concern, my friend.

376
00:27:22,436 --> 00:27:23,869
I'm not your friend, pal.

377
00:27:23,937 --> 00:27:27,100
Stevie, Laurent and I are
just playing a love game.

378
00:27:27,174 --> 00:27:29,836
I make $1,000, and then he
puts me in his feature film.

379
00:27:29,910 --> 00:27:32,242
Don't you see
what's going on here?

380
00:27:32,312 --> 00:27:35,509
This ass-wipe is a con man,
and he's turned you into a whore.

381
00:27:35,582 --> 00:27:38,312
If you could hear yourself
speak right now.

382
00:27:38,385 --> 00:27:40,353
Loved blowing you.
Thanks for the tip.

383
00:27:42,823 --> 00:27:46,088
Okay, fine.
You need $1,000?

384
00:27:46,593 --> 00:27:48,618
Here. Here's...

385
00:27:49,596 --> 00:27:50,756
420.

386
00:27:51,765 --> 00:27:53,858
I'm still a C and a fin-saw short.

387
00:27:55,135 --> 00:27:56,693
That's all I've got.

388
00:27:58,305 --> 00:27:59,863
Your shoes look new.

389
00:28:08,415 --> 00:28:11,907
There, Laurent.
I don't see any cameras.

390
00:28:12,853 --> 00:28:15,481
Yes, hello.
Thank you. Good-bye.

391
00:28:15,555 --> 00:28:17,580
The film, it was canceled.

392
00:28:31,371 --> 00:28:34,431
There's some people out there
you just gotta watch out for.

393
00:28:35,509 --> 00:28:38,069
I'm starting to see that now.

394
00:28:38,912 --> 00:28:42,780
I guess I never had anybody
to show me who they are.

395
00:28:42,849 --> 00:28:44,476
Well, you do now.

396
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:48,683
I know what it's like
to grow up without a mom.

397
00:29:06,406 --> 00:29:08,067
Don't you listen to her, either.

398
00:29:08,141 --> 00:29:11,167
You're a man
because of what's in here,

399
00:29:11,244 --> 00:29:12,677
not in...

400
00:29:15,215 --> 00:29:16,614
Down a little.

401
00:29:16,683 --> 00:29:20,050
To the left. Now up.
You went past it.

402
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:21,846
...here.

403
00:29:21,922 --> 00:29:25,153
Go back a little more.
More. Stop.

404
00:29:25,959 --> 00:29:27,153
There.

405
00:29:28,795 --> 00:29:30,160
Really?

406
00:29:30,697 --> 00:29:32,289
Press down.

407
00:29:34,234 --> 00:29:36,794
Try rolling your fingers
back and forth.

408
00:29:47,414 --> 00:29:51,510
I'm sure when it's firm...

409
00:29:54,254 --> 00:29:56,848
Well, it kind of-

410
00:29:56,923 --> 00:30:01,087
So, listen, how about
tomorow night I take you out

411
00:30:01,161 --> 00:30:04,756
for a great big steak dinner?

412
00:30:05,999 --> 00:30:08,661
Your mom is my roommate.

413
00:30:12,138 --> 00:30:13,298
Sure.

414
00:30:13,907 --> 00:30:15,272
Okay.

415
00:30:15,909 --> 00:30:18,605
But thanks
for the money and the shoes.

416
00:30:24,884 --> 00:30:26,215
If you're like -me.

417
00:30:26,286 --> 00:30:29,016
your days are
ja-m-packed with activity.

418
00:30:29,089 --> 00:30:32,388
It seems that no sooner
? watching -my programs

419
00:30:32,459 --> 00:30:34,188
that a new -magazine arrives.

420
00:30:34,261 --> 00:30:37,492
And sudderly.?.

421
00:30:37,564 --> 00:30:39,623
That's why I'm so grateful

422
00:30:39,699 --> 00:30:42,930
for new Bizzy Gal's
Diner's Ready.

423
00:30:44,137 --> 00:30:46,537
our keep Bizzy Gal
right in your cabinets.

424
00:30:46,606 --> 00:30:48,938
No -more lugging open
that heavy freezer door.

425
00:30:49,009 --> 00:30:53,070
And the exhausting chore
of reheating-a the of the past!

426
00:30:53,146 --> 00:30:55,979
Bizzy Gal -meals are treated
with Nutri-Dation.

427
00:30:56,049 --> 00:30:57,778
which reheats the
chemically unstable

428
00:30:57,851 --> 00:31:00,752
in a way that feels
just like heat in your -mouth.

429
00:31:00,820 --> 00:31:04,278
All they'll know is
it tastes great.

430
00:31:04,357 --> 00:31:06,689
Bizzy Gal Dirnner's Ready
is sold as a novelty item

431
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:08,694
and is not intended
for human consumption.

432
00:31:08,762 --> 00:31:10,889
Side effects of of injestion
could include cancer

433
00:31:10,964 --> 00:31:12,795
bleeding
enlargment of the heart

434
00:31:12,866 --> 00:31:14,834
and second degree
burns along the rectal cavity.

435
00:31:14,901 --> 00:31:17,131
resulting in irreversible
incontinece.

436
00:31:17,837 --> 00:31:19,998
Us gals have it hard enough.

437
00:31:21,508 --> 00:31:24,807
Congratulations, Varla.

438
00:31:25,979 --> 00:31:28,812
Thanks.
Stevie got it for me.

439
00:31:28,882 --> 00:31:30,975
So, are you and he...

440
00:31:31,584 --> 00:31:32,744
No.

441
00:31:33,453 --> 00:31:37,412
I need someone
with a... bigger heart.

442
00:31:37,490 --> 00:31:39,390
I remember my first commercial.

443
00:31:39,459 --> 00:31:42,656
Do you have a tape?
I could learn so much.

444
00:31:42,729 --> 00:31:44,993
It wasn't for TV exactly.

445
00:31:45,065 --> 00:31:47,192
I used to come out
between acts

446
00:31:47,267 --> 00:31:52,500
and sing this darling song
about Dr. Vim's Miracle Elixir.

447
00:31:55,475 --> 00:31:57,705
That's what led
to my first kinetoscope.

448
00:32:01,815 --> 00:32:04,807
If only my mother had lived
to see my very first-

449
00:32:04,884 --> 00:32:06,875
Well, that's enough
about your commercial.

450
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:29,874
Tlhat was tlhe worst one yet.

451
00:32:29,943 --> 00:32:31,877
According to -my calculator.

452
00:32:31,945 --> 00:32:35,472
the asteroid will pernetrate
the "astmosphere" in 15-minutes.

453
00:32:36,249 --> 00:32:38,012
Oh. Billy...

454
00:32:38,084 --> 00:32:39,813
all the children.

455
00:32:41,654 --> 00:32:44,452
you saved all you could
with the space ark.

456
00:32:44,524 --> 00:32:46,082
But what about all the people

457
00:32:46,159 --> 00:32:49,151
who could have fit
into space arks three and two?

458
00:32:53,066 --> 00:32:55,933
If ony the president
had listened to -me.

459
00:32:56,002 --> 00:32:58,334
As I should have when you
were pro-moted over -me.

460
00:32:58,405 --> 00:33:00,839
but I was just too -macho.

461
00:33:02,475 --> 00:33:06,571
Or -maybe I was
so busy being an...

462
00:33:06,646 --> 00:33:09,137
astro-physi-cist...

463
00:33:09,215 --> 00:33:11,809
that I forgot how to be...

464
00:33:15,221 --> 00:33:16,848
...a wo-man.

465
00:33:46,219 --> 00:33:47,413
Motherfuck.

466
00:33:53,426 --> 00:33:54,916
Good night, Coco.

467
00:33:56,663 --> 00:33:58,062
Good night, hon.

468
00:34:00,266 --> 00:34:01,961
I love you.

469
00:34:02,836 --> 00:34:04,428
I love you, too.

470
00:34:07,407 --> 00:34:09,466
Pipe down in there.

471
00:34:12,779 --> 00:34:14,679
School day tomorow.

472
00:34:26,493 --> 00:34:28,791
Santa Claus has entered.

473
00:34:31,197 --> 00:34:33,290
Is your -mo-m-my ho-me?

474
00:34:35,235 --> 00:34:36,896
My -mother died

475
00:34:36,970 --> 00:34:41,066
in 1975.

476
00:34:42,375 --> 00:34:43,706
Sad face.

477
00:34:45,178 --> 00:34:46,770
Santa Claus has left.

478
00:35:24,617 --> 00:35:26,016
Mommy?

479
00:35:27,220 --> 00:35:28,847
I'm home.

480
00:35:39,699 --> 00:35:41,326
Shut up!

481
00:35:44,504 --> 00:35:47,268
- I heard screaming.
- Jesus, what?

482
00:35:48,007 --> 00:35:49,599
I had this dream.

483
00:35:49,676 --> 00:35:51,837
Ever since the hospital.

484
00:35:52,912 --> 00:35:56,746
I think that doctor gave me
morphine and then raped me.

485
00:35:56,816 --> 00:35:58,374
Oh, my God.

486
00:36:00,620 --> 00:36:02,713
So, it's a sex dream.

487
00:36:02,789 --> 00:36:06,725
Here, have some chocolate-
Have some peach sorbet.

488
00:36:06,793 --> 00:36:09,660
The babies.
It doesn't make sense.

489
00:36:09,729 --> 00:36:11,356
There's no connection.

490
00:36:11,431 --> 00:36:14,559
And I cry for no reason
and blame myself.

491
00:36:14,634 --> 00:36:17,569
I've been slowly
cutting off my toe with a nail file,

492
00:36:17,637 --> 00:36:20,299
and I have no idea why!

493
00:36:22,241 --> 00:36:25,642
I went in on a television
motion picture about rape,

494
00:36:25,712 --> 00:36:29,045
and in the back of the script
was a number for a support hotline.

495
00:36:29,115 --> 00:36:30,912
Jesus Christ, Varla.

496
00:36:30,984 --> 00:36:35,546
Does everything around here
have to be about your fucking career?

497
00:36:35,622 --> 00:36:37,089
I was only trying to help.

498
00:36:37,156 --> 00:36:39,750
I know what you were
only trying to do.

499
00:36:39,826 --> 00:36:41,919
I've seen your type before plenty.

500
00:36:41,995 --> 00:36:45,692
You worm your way
into the life of a huge star-

501
00:36:45,765 --> 00:36:49,098
next thing I know,
you've stolen my son and my maid.

502
00:36:49,702 --> 00:36:52,466
Well, I won't let you
steal my career!

503
00:36:52,538 --> 00:36:54,472
No, that's your specialty!

504
00:36:55,074 --> 00:36:56,268
Sleepy.

505
00:36:56,342 --> 00:37:00,836
Asteroid was supposed to be
my mom's big break, not yours!

506
00:37:00,913 --> 00:37:03,541
She spent two months
preparing for that role,

507
00:37:03,616 --> 00:37:05,743
working with her
being-crushed coach.

508
00:37:06,419 --> 00:37:09,183
I can still
remember her practicing.

509
00:37:09,255 --> 00:37:11,450
"It's huge!"

510
00:37:13,993 --> 00:37:17,724
Little did she know
that in Hollywood,

511
00:37:17,797 --> 00:37:21,631
the real killer asteroids
don't fall from the sky!

512
00:37:25,371 --> 00:37:27,464
Still raped over here.

513
00:37:42,488 --> 00:37:45,480
- Oh, my God, I'm on fire!
- I thought you were Varla.

514
00:37:45,558 --> 00:37:47,822
Oh, my God!
Evie, I'm burning!

515
00:37:47,894 --> 00:37:49,191
Burns-cold water.

516
00:37:49,796 --> 00:37:50,990
There you go.

517
00:37:51,064 --> 00:37:54,830
I'm serious.
I'll do anything they offer.

518
00:37:54,901 --> 00:37:56,027
Except porno.

519
00:37:56,102 --> 00:37:59,435
Mom, you doing porn
isn't porn anymore-it's horor.

520
00:37:59,505 --> 00:38:02,303
Everyone, this is Nipsy.

521
00:38:02,375 --> 00:38:05,606
- Nipsy, this is everyone.
- Hey, Nipsy.

522
00:38:05,678 --> 00:38:07,509
- Boy or girl?
- From you.

523
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:08,740
He's a boy.

524
00:38:08,815 --> 00:38:12,251
No, seriously,
supposing just for an instance

525
00:38:12,318 --> 00:38:14,548
they suddenly need
a new Bizzy Gal after tonight,

526
00:38:14,620 --> 00:38:16,281
or tomorow morning, latest.

527
00:38:16,355 --> 00:38:18,152
Mom, no one will hire you.

528
00:38:18,224 --> 00:38:19,384
Why not?

529
00:38:19,459 --> 00:38:22,121
I mean, I admit my looks
are starting to go...

530
00:38:22,195 --> 00:38:25,221
Starting to go?
Evie, your looks are home and in bed.

531
00:38:26,933 --> 00:38:28,594
I think you know.

532
00:38:28,668 --> 00:38:30,795
- My attitude?
- No.

533
00:38:30,870 --> 00:38:32,428
- My drinking.
- No.

534
00:38:32,505 --> 00:38:35,133
Chronic lateness?
Never learn my lines?

535
00:38:35,208 --> 00:38:37,642
The kleptomania?
I spread disease?

536
00:38:37,710 --> 00:38:38,870
Then what?

537
00:38:38,945 --> 00:38:42,312
That little thing where you ran
over a family of four while drunk?

538
00:38:42,381 --> 00:38:46,681
It was a family of six.
I only killed four.

539
00:38:46,753 --> 00:38:50,154
And what kind of people have
a picnic in their own backyard?

540
00:38:50,223 --> 00:38:52,418
- Mom.
- What?

541
00:38:58,431 --> 00:39:00,058
Nipsy.

542
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:03,259
What's wrong with him?

543
00:39:04,103 --> 00:39:05,593
Nipsy!

544
00:39:05,671 --> 00:39:08,469
That was for Varla.

545
00:39:10,343 --> 00:39:14,439
Co-ming up. Evie Harris vo-mits
her way off the Hollywood Squares

546
00:39:14,514 --> 00:39:17,711
when Has-Beens continues.

547
00:39:19,051 --> 00:39:23,181
If you're like -me. your days
are ja-m-packed with activity.

548
00:39:23,256 --> 00:39:26,350
It see-ms that no sooner
a- m I done watching -my pro-

549
00:39:28,761 --> 00:39:33,130
If you're like -me. your days
are ja-m-packed with activity.

550
00:39:34,167 --> 00:39:35,725
Us gals have it hard enough.

551
00:39:35,802 --> 00:39:37,736
Us gals have it hard-

552
00:39:37,804 --> 00:39:39,431
...have it hard... hard...

553
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:42,268
...hard enough.

554
00:39:53,553 --> 00:39:54,986
It's huge!

555
00:39:59,859 --> 00:40:02,657
It's huge!

556
00:40:09,368 --> 00:40:12,462
I think Bizzy Gal
is the -most i-mportant thing

557
00:40:12,538 --> 00:40:14,904
to happen for wo-men

558
00:40:14,974 --> 00:40:17,670
since they were
e- mancipated fro-m slavery.

559
00:40:19,645 --> 00:40:21,613
...1975 People's Pick Awards!

560
00:40:21,681 --> 00:40:23,205
I can't finish this.

561
00:40:23,282 --> 00:40:27,685
...Leonard Ni-moy. Charo.
Robert Reed...

562
00:40:27,753 --> 00:40:31,814
I heard about Asteroid.
Congratulations.

563
00:40:31,891 --> 00:40:34,155
...Ted Knight.
Joey Heatherton.

564
00:40:34,227 --> 00:40:36,354
The Os-mond Five.
Lee Majors.

565
00:40:36,429 --> 00:40:39,091
Allen Ludden.
Willia-m Conrad...

566
00:41:19,672 --> 00:41:21,663
No!

567
00:41:30,716 --> 00:41:34,015
Never, dude. You're never
going to look normal again.

568
00:41:34,086 --> 00:41:36,316
Dr. Benson.

569
00:41:36,989 --> 00:41:39,048
- He drug and rape you yet?
- No.

570
00:41:39,125 --> 00:41:41,719
Coco. I was going to call.

571
00:41:41,794 --> 00:41:44,285
How nice.

572
00:41:44,363 --> 00:41:48,823
A girl always likes that after
she's been drugged and raped.

573
00:41:48,901 --> 00:41:52,337
Right. About that,
I am so sory.

574
00:41:52,405 --> 00:41:53,599
Sory?

575
00:41:54,307 --> 00:41:58,107
Then I guess that makes it okay
that you drugged and raped me.

576
00:41:58,177 --> 00:42:01,237
Jesus Christ,
I get the fucking point.

577
00:42:01,314 --> 00:42:03,782
Look, you have
every right to be ticked.

578
00:42:03,849 --> 00:42:07,546
And I know it's no excuse,
but can I try to explain?

579
00:42:07,620 --> 00:42:10,521
- Explain?
- You reminded me of someone.

580
00:42:10,589 --> 00:42:13,057
Years ago, when I was
first starting out...

581
00:42:15,328 --> 00:42:17,558
...the most beautiful girl
came to see me.

582
00:42:18,698 --> 00:42:20,757
I felt our souls touch.

583
00:42:21,767 --> 00:42:23,701
But I froze.

584
00:42:23,769 --> 00:42:25,703
I tried to get in touch
with her later,

585
00:42:25,771 --> 00:42:28,569
but the clinic's records were anonymous
because of the letter bombs.

586
00:42:28,641 --> 00:42:30,302
Dr. Perfect?

587
00:42:32,545 --> 00:42:34,513
Patient Huge Tits?

588
00:42:35,548 --> 00:42:37,573
- It's really you!
- It's really you!

589
00:42:37,650 --> 00:42:41,450
When you came back after
I'd lost hope and maried, I broke.

590
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:44,421
I couldn't date anyone
without comparing them to you.

591
00:42:44,490 --> 00:42:48,119
Coco, God has given us
a second chance,

592
00:42:48,194 --> 00:42:51,129
and I say we take it.

593
00:42:51,197 --> 00:42:53,222
You still shouldn't
have raped me.

594
00:42:53,299 --> 00:42:55,164
Really super sory.

595
00:43:26,832 --> 00:43:29,767
- To...
- Right. Thanks.

596
00:43:44,650 --> 00:43:47,312
Dr. Perfect.

597
00:44:35,534 --> 00:44:38,765
Nice, princess.
Real sexy.

598
00:44:51,543 --> 00:44:54,535
Chester, this will be
where you poop.

599
00:44:56,214 --> 00:44:59,843
That's a good poop, Chester.

600
00:45:00,686 --> 00:45:03,120
God, what did they
feed you at that kennel?

601
00:45:07,893 --> 00:45:10,828
Come on!

602
00:45:16,068 --> 00:45:18,502
Guess who's going
to be in a movie.

603
00:45:18,570 --> 00:45:22,529
- Me?
- Congratulations, Varla!

604
00:45:23,141 --> 00:45:24,631
What's it called?

605
00:45:24,710 --> 00:45:27,702
I think Counter Girl.
because that's the name of my role.

606
00:45:27,779 --> 00:45:29,713
Tarantulatropolis.

607
00:45:29,781 --> 00:45:32,773
So no more commercials for you.

608
00:45:32,851 --> 00:45:36,184
I told Stevie those tiny little
parts do nothing for me.

609
00:45:36,254 --> 00:45:38,313
I need great big parts.

610
00:45:38,390 --> 00:45:41,518
Stevie, why didn't you
put me up for that part?

611
00:45:41,593 --> 00:45:43,527
I could only
recommend one person.

612
00:45:43,595 --> 00:45:46,393
That's obviously a lie
because she's practically two.

613
00:45:47,032 --> 00:45:48,192
I'm sory.

614
00:45:48,266 --> 00:45:50,928
A little less binge,
a little more purge.

615
00:45:51,003 --> 00:45:53,938
Damn it, Mom, shut up!

616
00:45:54,873 --> 00:45:57,774
Why should I lift a finger for you?
What have you ever done for me?

617
00:45:57,843 --> 00:46:00,141
Caried you to term,
for starters.

618
00:46:00,212 --> 00:46:03,477
Coco would have had you
sucked out for a phone number.

619
00:46:03,548 --> 00:46:06,449
Evie, I can't believe
you would...

620
00:46:06,518 --> 00:46:08,509
Stop! Quiet!

621
00:46:14,459 --> 00:46:17,394
I'm sory for the things
I said the other day.

622
00:46:17,462 --> 00:46:21,728
And I know my recent success
has been stressful.

623
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:23,358
I'm sory for that, too.

624
00:46:24,136 --> 00:46:25,797
Well, good.

625
00:46:27,305 --> 00:46:31,173
Evie, Varla said she's sory
for what she said.

626
00:46:31,243 --> 00:46:32,608
I heard her.

627
00:46:32,678 --> 00:46:34,771
Well, you said
some mean things, too.

628
00:46:34,846 --> 00:46:36,108
Like what?

629
00:46:36,181 --> 00:46:39,048
Like she's all binge
and no purge.

630
00:46:39,117 --> 00:46:42,109
- I did? That's funny.
- Mom!

631
00:46:42,788 --> 00:46:44,619
It's okay.

632
00:46:44,690 --> 00:46:46,749
I was thinking.

633
00:46:46,825 --> 00:46:50,989
I bet the reason you're
having trouble getting parts

634
00:46:51,063 --> 00:46:54,760
is that people have forgotten
how great you are.

635
00:46:54,833 --> 00:46:56,425
So you gotta show 'em,

636
00:46:56,501 --> 00:46:59,766
just like you did in your
wonderful special Christ-mas Evie.

637
00:47:01,506 --> 00:47:05,272
I remember watching it that year,
even though I was still quite small.

638
00:47:05,811 --> 00:47:07,802
I'm sure not for your age.

639
00:47:10,482 --> 00:47:12,712
And I remember
wanting to meet you.

640
00:47:12,784 --> 00:47:14,877
No one's going
to give Mom a special.

641
00:47:14,953 --> 00:47:16,784
I know.

642
00:47:16,855 --> 00:47:18,789
Even though they should.

643
00:47:18,857 --> 00:47:22,258
But late at night, when they
have those infomercials on

644
00:47:22,327 --> 00:47:24,989
where they sell
that makeup and stuff...

645
00:47:25,063 --> 00:47:27,725
I could do one selling me.

646
00:47:27,799 --> 00:47:29,767
A speci-mercial!

647
00:47:30,335 --> 00:47:32,633
Do you have any idea
how much that would cost?

648
00:47:32,704 --> 00:47:35,138
$40,000. I already checked.

649
00:47:35,207 --> 00:47:36,834
Plus production costs.

650
00:47:36,908 --> 00:47:42,505
I would be willing to give $10,000
of my Tarantulatropolis money.

651
00:47:42,581 --> 00:47:46,449
Varla, that is so generous.

652
00:47:46,518 --> 00:47:48,418
We'd still have to
mortgage the house.

653
00:47:48,487 --> 00:47:52,048
I'll make it back tenfold
when the parts start rolling in!

654
00:47:52,124 --> 00:47:53,421
Thanks, Varla.

655
00:47:53,492 --> 00:47:56,017
I always liked you.

656
00:47:56,094 --> 00:47:58,790
Evie, let's not quarel
anymore, all right?

657
00:47:59,531 --> 00:48:02,625
As a girl, whenever
I was cross or blue,

658
00:48:02,701 --> 00:48:07,229
my mother used to say that
feelings are like treasures,

659
00:48:07,305 --> 00:48:08,829
so bury them.

660
00:48:16,515 --> 00:48:17,675
Excuse me.

661
00:48:17,749 --> 00:48:21,412
I'm a little chilly.
Be right back.

662
00:48:35,834 --> 00:48:37,893
I've really enjoyed
these past couple weeks.

663
00:48:39,404 --> 00:48:41,838
Doug, I have, too.

664
00:48:41,907 --> 00:48:43,772
It's funny, isn't it?

665
00:48:43,842 --> 00:48:47,403
You fantasize about
something your entire life,

666
00:48:47,479 --> 00:48:52,974
and the truth is always
so much more... muted.

667
00:48:53,051 --> 00:48:54,245
Muted?

668
00:48:54,319 --> 00:48:56,651
In the sense of "less joyful. "

669
00:48:57,589 --> 00:48:59,420
But what I've come to realize

670
00:48:59,491 --> 00:49:01,891
is that everything in life
is a disappointment.

671
00:49:01,960 --> 00:49:03,552
And in any situation,

672
00:49:03,628 --> 00:49:06,188
you have to ask yourself,

673
00:49:06,264 --> 00:49:09,995
"Can I reasonably expect better?"

674
00:49:11,002 --> 00:49:13,630
And, Coco, I don't think I can.

675
00:49:18,510 --> 00:49:19,875
Mary me.

676
00:49:20,846 --> 00:49:24,373
- Doug, that's not a very-
- You can't, either.

677
00:49:24,449 --> 00:49:27,282
You're not much to look at.

678
00:49:27,919 --> 00:49:29,750
You're no great lay.

679
00:49:30,288 --> 00:49:32,381
Quite honestly,
you're a drag to be around.

680
00:49:33,692 --> 00:49:35,091
Like I deserve better?

681
00:49:35,160 --> 00:49:37,993
I've got a bum heart.
I drink.

682
00:49:38,063 --> 00:49:40,088
I drug and rape my patients.

683
00:49:40,165 --> 00:49:42,759
- You said just me.
- And I lie.

684
00:49:44,202 --> 00:49:48,036
What do you say
you and I stop chasing happy

685
00:49:48,106 --> 00:49:49,801
and settle for each other?

686
00:50:03,355 --> 00:50:06,222
- This is your college-
- It's a fucking ring.

687
00:50:06,291 --> 00:50:07,622
And...

688
00:50:10,662 --> 00:50:14,462
Michael, what are you
trying to do, play me into orbit?

689
00:50:14,532 --> 00:50:16,261
That's how it goes.

690
00:50:17,035 --> 00:50:18,662
- Bitch.
- I heard that.

691
00:50:18,737 --> 00:50:20,034
Sory.

692
00:50:20,105 --> 00:50:21,265
Bitch.

693
00:50:26,211 --> 00:50:29,703
Singing that song
always makes me so proud.

694
00:50:29,781 --> 00:50:33,547
I a-m woman.
ERA now!

695
00:50:33,618 --> 00:50:36,280
- Applause, applause, applause.
- Bitch, bitch, bitch.

696
00:50:37,022 --> 00:50:38,683
Thank you!

697
00:50:39,257 --> 00:50:41,157
Thank you!

698
00:50:41,226 --> 00:50:43,660
I tell you,
I feel like I'm up here tonight

699
00:50:43,728 --> 00:50:46,288
performing in front
of all my friends.

700
00:50:46,898 --> 00:50:50,334
You know, sometimes
all we have are friends.

701
00:50:50,402 --> 00:50:53,599
Like my friend Varla,
TV's Bizzy Gal,

702
00:50:53,672 --> 00:50:56,641
who's so good in those commercials,
she actually acts thin.

703
00:50:57,375 --> 00:50:59,275
And now she has a big movie.

704
00:50:59,344 --> 00:51:01,335
But on the brink
of all that success,

705
00:51:01,413 --> 00:51:05,543
she was risking everything
by working as a prostitute.

706
00:51:05,617 --> 00:51:07,949
So I sat her down-

707
00:51:08,019 --> 00:51:09,452
Oh, my God.

708
00:51:09,521 --> 00:51:12,888
Coco! What did you think?
Now, be honest.

709
00:51:12,958 --> 00:51:16,223
Varla gave you the idea
to do this show.

710
00:51:16,294 --> 00:51:17,989
She put up money for it.

711
00:51:18,063 --> 00:51:20,463
And I'm repaying the favor.

712
00:51:20,532 --> 00:51:23,092
If something like this got out
after she was famous,

713
00:51:23,168 --> 00:51:25,728
it would destroy her
like it did her mother.

714
00:51:25,804 --> 00:51:28,238
ou destroyed her mother!

715
00:51:28,306 --> 00:51:30,740
For all the good it did you.

716
00:51:31,509 --> 00:51:36,537
You're just a fucking walking
ball of ambition, aren't you, Evie?

717
00:51:36,614 --> 00:51:38,309
You'd step on anybody,

718
00:51:38,383 --> 00:51:41,181
destroy anyone
if you thought it would help you.

719
00:51:42,520 --> 00:51:44,852
But you know what's funny?

720
00:51:44,923 --> 00:51:49,485
People can smell it on you,
and it makes them gag.

721
00:51:51,696 --> 00:51:54,164
That's why your career
never went anywhere.

722
00:51:54,232 --> 00:51:56,530
My career was going
like gangbusters

723
00:51:56,601 --> 00:51:59,001
till that family
made me run them down!

724
00:52:00,105 --> 00:52:03,973
And all you had to do
was say you're sory.

725
00:52:05,610 --> 00:52:08,306
It's not that you didn't, Evie.

726
00:52:10,382 --> 00:52:12,407
It's that you didn't know to.

727
00:52:13,785 --> 00:52:18,984
Audiences require
at least a shred of humanity.

728
00:52:20,725 --> 00:52:24,627
Even from their
game show personalities.

729
00:52:27,432 --> 00:52:29,832
- Bitch.
- I heard that!

730
00:52:38,009 --> 00:52:39,306
Sign here.

731
00:52:41,713 --> 00:52:44,181
And here.

732
00:52:48,853 --> 00:52:50,184
Initial here.

733
00:52:54,059 --> 00:52:58,052
"V.S."- such pretty initials.

734
00:53:02,667 --> 00:53:03,827
Sign here.

735
00:53:21,352 --> 00:53:24,617
It's official.
You're a movie star.

736
00:53:26,891 --> 00:53:28,483
I'll show you out.

737
00:53:43,274 --> 00:53:44,798
On second thought...

738
00:53:46,811 --> 00:53:49,507
...let's really seal the deal.

739
00:54:14,973 --> 00:54:17,100
Are you okay?
Do you want to stop?

740
00:54:17,175 --> 00:54:18,472
I'm fine.

741
00:54:56,915 --> 00:54:58,246
I'm sory.

742
00:55:00,185 --> 00:55:02,415
This has never happened before.

743
00:55:03,621 --> 00:55:06,522
- What hasn't?
- I can't...

744
00:55:09,427 --> 00:55:12,487
Yeah. What's up with that?

745
00:55:17,368 --> 00:55:18,699
I've been so...

746
00:55:27,812 --> 00:55:31,805
I never thought,
you know, you and me...

747
00:55:31,883 --> 00:55:34,044
I couldn't stop thinking about you.

748
00:55:34,118 --> 00:55:37,281
And at my practice I work
with a lot of investigators.

749
00:55:39,891 --> 00:55:41,654
I had them get stuff on you.

750
00:55:42,927 --> 00:55:45,225
I don't think
I like the sound of that.

751
00:55:45,296 --> 00:55:46,456
Nothing creepy.

752
00:55:46,531 --> 00:55:49,295
I was just looking
for high school yearbooks,

753
00:55:49,367 --> 00:55:52,200
stories from old boyfriends
to beat off to.

754
00:55:52,270 --> 00:55:54,761
But then things
started turning up.

755
00:55:54,839 --> 00:55:56,466
Like what kind of things?

756
00:55:56,541 --> 00:55:59,942
Well, like things
in your ninth-grade diary.

757
00:56:00,011 --> 00:56:01,774
How did you get that?

758
00:56:01,846 --> 00:56:04,747
A couple goons
roughed up your aunt.

759
00:56:04,816 --> 00:56:07,307
"September 8, 1988.

760
00:56:07,385 --> 00:56:09,250
"Evie Haris killed my mom.

761
00:56:09,320 --> 00:56:12,221
I watched her Christmas special,
and I hate, hate, hate her. "

762
00:56:13,191 --> 00:56:15,716
And March 15th.

763
00:56:17,662 --> 00:56:19,926
"One day
I'm going to find Evie Haris.

764
00:56:19,998 --> 00:56:21,465
"I'm going to make friends with her,

765
00:56:21,532 --> 00:56:24,262
and then I'm going to make her
pay, pay, pay, pay... "

766
00:56:24,335 --> 00:56:25,427
The rest is all "pay. "

767
00:56:25,503 --> 00:56:30,065
That was a brillion years ago,
before I discovered spiritualicity.

768
00:56:31,142 --> 00:56:35,101
Maybe, or maybe
you still want her to pay.

769
00:56:35,179 --> 00:56:37,147
Maybe just happening
to answer her ad,

770
00:56:37,215 --> 00:56:39,183
maybe driving her
into a jealous rage,

771
00:56:39,250 --> 00:56:42,481
maybe tricking her into spending
all of her money on this speci-mercial,

772
00:56:42,553 --> 00:56:45,283
maybe it's all part of some plan.

773
00:56:45,356 --> 00:56:49,554
Why should you even care?
She never loved you.

774
00:56:52,530 --> 00:56:54,657
That doesn't mean
I can't love her.

775
00:57:07,145 --> 00:57:09,238
Shred of humanity.

776
00:57:13,017 --> 00:57:14,177
Cuts.

777
00:57:15,753 --> 00:57:18,244
Career never went anywhere.

778
00:57:19,057 --> 00:57:21,685
Hello!
BaTTlestar fucking Galactica!

779
00:57:21,759 --> 00:57:23,021
Go to bed.

780
00:57:23,094 --> 00:57:24,584
Fuck you!

781
00:57:26,964 --> 00:57:28,431
Cut.

782
00:57:28,599 --> 00:57:30,430
Cut.

783
00:57:30,501 --> 00:57:32,332
ncut.

784
00:57:32,403 --> 00:57:33,768
Jesus!

785
00:57:33,838 --> 00:57:36,102
I guess you can't
fuck your way to the top,

786
00:57:36,174 --> 00:57:39,803
or I'd be queen
of the goddamn universe!

787
00:57:40,311 --> 00:57:41,471
Cuts.

788
00:57:42,213 --> 00:57:44,579
- Hello.
- Coco awake?

789
00:57:44,649 --> 00:57:47,584
Thought I'd twist her arm
for a lie-there.

790
00:57:47,652 --> 00:57:49,643
Well, you could do that.

791
00:57:49,721 --> 00:57:53,987
And then again,
I'm already on my back and tanked.

792
00:58:10,241 --> 00:58:13,472
Harder. Harder!

793
00:58:23,888 --> 00:58:27,153
You have to admit, this is
kind of its own punishment.

794
00:58:27,225 --> 00:58:28,886
Harder!

795
00:58:37,435 --> 00:58:39,903
So, this is the stage.

796
00:58:39,971 --> 00:58:41,131
What?

797
00:58:41,205 --> 00:58:45,665
Where's the big block letters
that say "Evie" like I paid for?

798
00:58:45,743 --> 00:58:47,734
We add that in
with the computer later.

799
00:58:47,812 --> 00:58:53,011
Really? Gosh, so much has changed
since I was slightly younger.

800
00:58:54,252 --> 00:58:56,413
But you always want
to fuck the grips.

801
00:58:56,487 --> 00:59:00,355
The only trick with this set
is you can't wear any blue

802
00:59:00,425 --> 00:59:04,953
or any color that has blue in it-
no turquoise, no purple.

803
00:59:05,029 --> 00:59:06,291
This is important.

804
00:59:06,364 --> 00:59:09,231
The computer replaces
all blue with the fake set.

805
00:59:09,801 --> 00:59:12,702
Speaking of fake sets,
how do you like my boobs?

806
00:59:12,770 --> 00:59:15,500
Feel. It's gross, huh?

807
01:00:18,903 --> 01:00:20,803
What's wrong?

808
01:00:20,872 --> 01:00:23,102
Let's save the kisses
till I'm sure you mean them.

809
01:00:29,247 --> 01:00:32,739
Of all the nights
for the Botox to wear off.

810
01:00:36,187 --> 01:00:37,745
Hello, Evie.

811
01:00:39,156 --> 01:00:40,418
Friends?

812
01:00:40,491 --> 01:00:43,517
- Are you high?
- A little bit.

813
01:00:44,195 --> 01:00:47,187
I just came by
to ask you one last time

814
01:00:47,265 --> 01:00:49,563
to drop that part about Varla.

815
01:00:49,634 --> 01:00:51,898
You're just mad
'cause I killed your mariage.

816
01:00:51,969 --> 01:00:55,530
Not this time.
We're going through with it.

817
01:00:56,841 --> 01:00:58,934
Of course, it won't
be charmed like I'd hoped,

818
01:00:59,010 --> 01:01:00,944
and I'll always be
a little mistrustful.

819
01:01:01,012 --> 01:01:02,479
You made sure of that.

820
01:01:02,547 --> 01:01:05,448
- Plus, he did rape you.
- Fair point.

821
01:01:07,818 --> 01:01:09,945
That's just it, Evie.

822
01:01:10,021 --> 01:01:14,185
You and me,
we're damaged goods.

823
01:01:14,258 --> 01:01:18,456
But Varla, at least
with her there's hope.

824
01:01:19,730 --> 01:01:21,857
And hope dies
quickly enough on its own.

825
01:01:24,468 --> 01:01:28,427
Ninety seconds, people.
Who has eyes on Gross Boobs?

826
01:01:31,208 --> 01:01:33,369
Miss Harris.
we need you on the set.

827
01:01:36,647 --> 01:01:38,376
Well, I'm on.

828
01:01:38,449 --> 01:01:40,178
This is gonna be
like The Mike Douglas Show

829
01:01:40,251 --> 01:01:43,652
and the Democratic Party Telethon
all rolled into one.

830
01:01:49,827 --> 01:01:50,987
Good luck, Ma.

831
01:01:51,896 --> 01:01:53,193
Thanks, Stevie.

832
01:01:53,264 --> 01:01:55,061
Good luck, Evie.

833
01:01:55,967 --> 01:01:57,332
Thank you, Coco.

834
01:01:57,401 --> 01:01:59,733
Yes. Good luck.

835
01:02:04,742 --> 01:02:06,334
Miss Harris?

836
01:02:21,225 --> 01:02:23,887
Live fro-m Glendale City College.

837
01:02:23,961 --> 01:02:26,623
it's All About Evie!

838
01:02:26,697 --> 01:02:29,962
Five... four... three...

839
01:02:32,970 --> 01:02:35,700
Look at me,
then you'll see

840
01:02:35,773 --> 01:02:37,206
All around you

841
01:02:37,274 --> 01:02:39,868
It's glittery
and flashy tonight

842
01:02:39,944 --> 01:02:42,845
It's all about Evie tonight

843
01:02:42,913 --> 01:02:45,404
It's special and dreamy,
it's all about Evie

844
01:02:45,483 --> 01:02:47,644
So come and look at me tonight

845
01:02:47,718 --> 01:02:49,709
House with a pool.
House with a pool.

846
01:02:49,787 --> 01:02:51,482
Look at me!

847
01:02:56,627 --> 01:02:58,822
I've been with you so long

848
01:02:58,896 --> 01:03:02,161
I find I'- m singing this song

849
01:03:04,935 --> 01:03:08,769
I've had ti-me
to think of a way

850
01:03:08,839 --> 01:03:11,899
For -my heart to say

851
01:03:14,512 --> 01:03:19,779
I need you
every -mo-ment of every day

852
01:03:19,850 --> 01:03:24,048
I love you
- more and -more than I'll ever say

853
01:03:24,121 --> 01:03:28,990
What will I do
if you decide to go away?

854
01:03:29,060 --> 01:03:32,427
Stay with me forever

855
01:03:32,496 --> 01:03:34,828
And ever

856
01:03:34,899 --> 01:03:38,733
Stay with me

857
01:03:41,539 --> 01:03:43,905
Thank you!

858
01:03:46,243 --> 01:03:48,541
I love you. too.

859
01:03:48,612 --> 01:03:51,638
God. I tell you. I feel like
I'm up here tonight performing

860
01:03:51,716 --> 01:03:53,843
in front of all my friends.

861
01:03:55,352 --> 01:03:58,116
And you know, sometimes
all we have are friends.

862
01:03:58,189 --> 01:03:59,247
What?

863
01:03:59,323 --> 01:04:00,756
Nothing.

864
01:04:00,825 --> 01:04:04,056
Like -my friend Varla.
TV's Bizzy Gal.

865
01:04:05,162 --> 01:04:08,495
Who's so good in those spots,
she actually acts thin.

866
01:04:10,101 --> 01:04:12,797
And now she has a movie!

867
01:04:12,870 --> 01:04:16,499
But on the brink of all
that success. she was willing to-

868
01:04:22,847 --> 01:04:26,908
Cat got -my tongue.
Let -me just drown hi-m real quick.

869
01:04:34,125 --> 01:04:35,422
That's better.

870
01:04:35,493 --> 01:04:37,085
Oh. boy!

871
01:04:42,700 --> 01:04:44,099
That was peculiar.

872
01:04:44,168 --> 01:04:47,660
- What's going on?
- Don't insult my intelligentness.

873
01:04:47,738 --> 01:04:50,172
I just felt a rush
of disorientation

874
01:04:50,241 --> 01:04:52,141
and a flash of colored lights.

875
01:04:52,209 --> 01:04:55,110
very -much like when you chop
a Vicodin up in your hash

876
01:04:55,179 --> 01:04:57,340
while you're still flying
fro-m last night's Quaalude.

877
01:04:57,414 --> 01:05:00,076
I'll say one thing for you-
you're poetic.

878
01:05:00,151 --> 01:05:02,915
I'd even swear there was a milligram
or two of psilocybin in there.

879
01:05:02,987 --> 01:05:04,511
No, one.

880
01:05:04,588 --> 01:05:06,146
What's that supposed to mean?

881
01:05:06,223 --> 01:05:09,283
But I didn't take
anything special tonight-Party!

882
01:05:09,360 --> 01:05:11,328
- I would never.
- Then who would?

883
01:05:14,064 --> 01:05:16,726
No. no. the one with sprinkles.

884
01:05:22,206 --> 01:05:25,266
Never mess
with the doctor's wife.

885
01:05:27,077 --> 01:05:30,012
Sit down, kids.
You'll miss the show.

886
01:05:31,348 --> 01:05:33,782
I can date-rape -myself.

887
01:05:33,851 --> 01:05:35,716
Five. six. seven. eight!

888
01:05:37,655 --> 01:05:38,917
Howie. Fred!

889
01:05:38,989 --> 01:05:43,392
Varla, TV's Bizzy Gal-
busy missy sissy.

890
01:05:43,460 --> 01:05:45,519
And her mom...

891
01:05:46,430 --> 01:05:47,988
I can't freeze this.

892
01:05:48,065 --> 01:05:50,431
- ou don't have an agent.
- Sleigh gay...

893
01:05:51,235 --> 01:05:52,361
It's huge.

894
01:05:52,436 --> 01:05:54,700
Mad about...
Talk... Tom...

895
01:05:54,772 --> 01:05:57,570
Can't be...
Goddamn it.

896
01:05:57,641 --> 01:06:00,804
They knew Oxloud
was hee naws.

897
01:06:02,513 --> 01:06:05,311
George Peppard-great lay.

898
01:06:05,382 --> 01:06:07,441
But talk about loud!

899
01:06:07,518 --> 01:06:10,351
They knew he was
coming in Oxnard.

900
01:06:14,825 --> 01:06:16,588
Wonderful!

901
01:06:17,561 --> 01:06:18,585
Thanks, Jeff.

902
01:06:18,662 --> 01:06:20,357
- It's Nate.
- Whatever.

903
01:06:26,136 --> 01:06:29,105
Lorne Greene!
"Swell party, Evie. "

904
01:06:29,173 --> 01:06:32,472
Say. did you ever
shit out that earring?

905
01:06:32,543 --> 01:06:34,477
Trail mix?

906
01:06:38,249 --> 01:06:40,240
- Trish!
- Keep away from Bob!

907
01:06:40,317 --> 01:06:41,477
Hi, Evie.

908
01:06:43,087 --> 01:06:44,281
So...

909
01:06:44,355 --> 01:06:45,913
where's...

910
01:06:46,790 --> 01:06:49,782
Brad? He's packing.

911
01:06:50,728 --> 01:06:52,923
The firm
transfered him to Michigan.

912
01:06:52,997 --> 01:06:54,862
Evie, he proposed!

913
01:06:57,034 --> 01:06:59,901
Coco, you can't move to Michigan.

914
01:06:59,970 --> 01:07:02,063
What about your acting career?

915
01:07:02,139 --> 01:07:05,939
Let's face it, I'm not
pretty enough to be an actress.

916
01:07:07,811 --> 01:07:10,678
Lots of actresses aren't pretty.

917
01:07:10,748 --> 01:07:13,308
Plus, who's gonna
keep my schedule?

918
01:07:13,384 --> 01:07:15,443
You could give
doing for yourself a try.

919
01:07:16,520 --> 01:07:19,853
Anyway, you said
you don't love Brad.

920
01:07:19,924 --> 01:07:22,051
I could learn.

921
01:07:22,126 --> 01:07:23,684
Don't bother.

922
01:07:25,863 --> 01:07:29,299
And this was my grandmother's!
Gimme it!

923
01:07:34,171 --> 01:07:35,536
Pull, you pussy.

924
01:07:37,041 --> 01:07:41,501
So. what do I have
on tap for to-morrow?

925
01:07:45,416 --> 01:07:47,213
Mom?

926
01:07:50,120 --> 01:07:52,520
Can I come and play
at the party with you?

927
01:07:52,589 --> 01:07:54,887
You'd just be bored.

928
01:07:57,094 --> 01:08:00,154
It's -more fun in there.
Mo-m-my. can I live...

929
01:08:00,230 --> 01:08:02,630
...here instead of
at boarding school this summer?

930
01:08:02,700 --> 01:08:05,601
We'll talk about it
on the way to the airport.

931
01:08:05,669 --> 01:08:10,003
But, Mommy,
I want to stay here with you.

932
01:08:10,074 --> 01:08:11,405
I love you.

933
01:08:11,909 --> 01:08:14,104
Of course you do.

934
01:08:14,645 --> 01:08:19,639
But Mommy can't let people know
she's old enough to have such a big boy.

935
01:08:19,717 --> 01:08:21,207
You'd ruin everything.

936
01:08:21,285 --> 01:08:23,549
I'll send you lots of money, though.

937
01:08:25,723 --> 01:08:26,883
Coming!

938
01:08:32,930 --> 01:08:35,421
Where is she?

939
01:08:39,269 --> 01:08:44,070
Where is the woman
who stole my life?

940
01:08:44,141 --> 01:08:45,608
Marla!

941
01:08:46,510 --> 01:08:48,944
There she is. There...

942
01:08:49,013 --> 01:08:52,312
- ... it is!
- Let me get you a drink.

943
01:08:55,252 --> 01:08:57,550
Stevie, come shield Mommy.

944
01:09:00,357 --> 01:09:01,688
No, no, no.

945
01:09:03,027 --> 01:09:05,757
I want you all here for this.

946
01:09:05,829 --> 01:09:08,059
I want you to hear this.
Just hear this.

947
01:09:08,132 --> 01:09:10,862
That is not her color.

948
01:09:11,368 --> 01:09:13,495
Why I'm not in Asteroid.

949
01:09:15,005 --> 01:09:17,667
And why my daughter Varla

950
01:09:17,741 --> 01:09:21,404
will never see me
in Asteroid...

951
01:09:21,478 --> 01:09:24,345
...and Asteroid 3...

952
01:09:25,182 --> 01:09:26,342
'Cause of her!

953
01:09:29,253 --> 01:09:30,413
Me?

954
01:09:31,922 --> 01:09:35,449
You all just think
I'm that crazy girl

955
01:09:35,526 --> 01:09:37,824
from the People's Pick Awards.

956
01:09:39,129 --> 01:09:40,756
But she drugged me!

957
01:09:42,032 --> 01:09:43,431
Mommy's on TV!

958
01:09:43,500 --> 01:09:47,596
And that whole week.
there was so -much fucking.

959
01:09:49,807 --> 01:09:53,766
I know just where
I'- m puTTing this.

960
01:09:57,581 --> 01:09:59,310
I forgot to thank -my agent.

961
01:09:59,383 --> 01:10:00,645
Mommy!

962
01:10:00,717 --> 01:10:02,184
She's lying!

963
01:10:10,494 --> 01:10:12,086
You don't have to.

964
01:10:14,331 --> 01:10:15,821
None of you.

965
01:10:19,937 --> 01:10:21,529
I don't care anymore.

966
01:10:23,240 --> 01:10:28,576
But I did want you all
to see one thing.

967
01:10:30,247 --> 01:10:35,514
Because I practiced
so, so much.

968
01:10:54,938 --> 01:10:57,168
It's huge!

969
01:11:11,755 --> 01:11:13,120
Looney Tunes.

970
01:11:13,824 --> 01:11:16,292
How about let's us
move the party inside?

971
01:11:18,896 --> 01:11:19,885
Wait.

972
01:11:19,963 --> 01:11:21,828
Everyone...

973
01:11:21,899 --> 01:11:23,560
...don't leave.

974
01:11:23,634 --> 01:11:25,727
Farah. Lee.

975
01:11:25,802 --> 01:11:27,064
Sheila.

976
01:11:27,137 --> 01:11:31,369
Mort, don't you go.
I'll switch agents.

977
01:11:31,441 --> 01:11:33,375
- You...
- ... don't have an agent.

978
01:11:33,443 --> 01:11:36,003
No! Dan, you can't.

979
01:11:36,079 --> 01:11:39,571
Everybody, it's early!
I'll break out the orgy coke.

980
01:11:39,650 --> 01:11:42,744
Heads-up-
there's another party at Charo's.

981
01:11:59,236 --> 01:12:00,464
Damn it!

982
01:12:01,271 --> 01:12:02,932
Damn it! Damn it!

983
01:12:21,291 --> 01:12:22,849
Everyone?

984
01:12:27,664 --> 01:12:29,097
Anyone?

985
01:12:33,403 --> 01:12:34,734
Hello?

986
01:12:41,578 --> 01:12:43,239
I can't be alone.

987
01:12:44,881 --> 01:12:46,075
Please.

988
01:12:52,122 --> 01:12:53,714
I'm scared.

989
01:13:21,618 --> 01:13:24,519
I didn't mean to!

990
01:13:30,560 --> 01:13:33,256
You want something,
you take it!

991
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:38,592
If I were a man...

992
01:14:04,461 --> 01:14:06,122
I'm sory.

993
01:14:19,376 --> 01:14:21,537
I'm sory.

994
01:14:23,980 --> 01:14:25,811
Thank you.

995
01:14:30,187 --> 01:14:32,280
I'm sory.

996
01:14:34,091 --> 01:14:35,581
I know.

997
01:14:40,764 --> 01:14:42,322
but -most of all.

998
01:14:45,435 --> 01:14:47,630
Everyone!

999
01:14:47,704 --> 01:14:51,470
For all of it, I'm sory!

1000
01:14:52,609 --> 01:14:53,633
It's huge!

1001
01:15:03,987 --> 01:15:05,818
Good night. everyone!

1002
01:15:08,792 --> 01:15:10,589
Good night, you.

1003
01:15:21,838 --> 01:15:23,829
- Mom!
- Over here.

1004
01:15:25,175 --> 01:15:28,872
Well, we're off to Wyoming
for this one's big-screen debut.

1005
01:15:29,513 --> 01:15:31,037
Tarantulas!

1006
01:15:32,249 --> 01:15:33,773
She's already in character.

1007
01:15:33,850 --> 01:15:36,910
- Hey, bud, a little help.
- Oh, yeah, I gotcha.

1008
01:15:37,521 --> 01:15:39,853
That was very good.

1009
01:15:40,991 --> 01:15:42,481
It was?

1010
01:15:42,559 --> 01:15:45,084
I really thought
I had tarantulas.

1011
01:15:45,162 --> 01:15:47,187
You're gonna be amazing.

1012
01:15:50,200 --> 01:15:52,361
I was woried
you might be upset.

1013
01:15:53,236 --> 01:15:56,501
I want you to have
a big career, Varla.

1014
01:15:56,573 --> 01:15:59,007
Big enough for all of us.

1015
01:15:59,776 --> 01:16:02,244
That means so much...

1016
01:16:04,314 --> 01:16:05,872
Mom.

1017
01:16:08,084 --> 01:16:09,984
Congratulations!

1018
01:16:10,053 --> 01:16:11,782
Thanks.

1019
01:16:11,855 --> 01:16:14,380
And you don't mind
about his little...

1020
01:16:16,092 --> 01:16:20,028
Once I realized
how much I love Stevie,

1021
01:16:20,096 --> 01:16:21,825
nothing else mattered.

1022
01:16:23,733 --> 01:16:25,360
It's a little small.

1023
01:16:27,671 --> 01:16:30,367
Well, we better get going
to the airport.

1024
01:16:30,440 --> 01:16:33,068
Stevie, I just heard.
Come here.

1025
01:16:36,446 --> 01:16:39,609
I am so happy for you.

1026
01:16:43,787 --> 01:16:45,379
I love you, Mom.

1027
01:16:46,122 --> 01:16:48,056
Of course you do.

1028
01:16:49,493 --> 01:16:51,688
Well, I'm all packed.

1029
01:16:52,696 --> 01:16:54,323
That must be Doug.

1030
01:16:55,465 --> 01:16:58,628
Coco, you can do a lot better.

1031
01:16:58,702 --> 01:17:00,226
It was never about him.

1032
01:17:03,673 --> 01:17:05,140
I'm pregnant.

1033
01:17:06,076 --> 01:17:07,634
Really?

1034
01:17:09,846 --> 01:17:11,336
Thank you.

1035
01:17:12,349 --> 01:17:15,341
And I'm sory about the house.

1036
01:17:15,418 --> 01:17:19,514
This old claptrap?
I'm glad to be rid of it.

1037
01:17:19,589 --> 01:17:21,147
Fresh start.

1038
01:17:25,095 --> 01:17:26,619
You gave me herpes.

1039
01:17:27,163 --> 01:17:29,927
Need to work
on your delivery, hon.

1040
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:34,494
I've heard that line read
by the biggest stars in Hollywood.
