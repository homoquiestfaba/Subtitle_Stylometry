This is Laguna.

and ride bicycles.

That's why we're
thinking of running.

353
00:24:05,695 --> 00:24:07,530
You start running,
Ben, you never stop.

354
00:24:07,697 --> 00:24:10,033
Now look, we go away for a while.
It would be nice.

355

Besides, there are other ways
to make money.

one view of the world, Chon.

laptops for kids in Africa?

359
00:24:21,086 --> 00:24:23,380
What if you could
make a $10 solar panel?

360
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:25,048

<i>Some of it, Indian tribal land,
not subject to federal law.</i>

thousands of acres all at once.

Not exactly. We value our scientists
and our seed-makers very much.

387
00:26:13,656 --> 00:26:16,493
It is your methods and your
network we want to partner with.

388
00:26:17,535 --> 00:26:19,829

No pun intended.

389
00:26:20,705 --> 00:26:22,165
Well said.

390
00:26:22,665 --> 00:26:25,502
In return, we take
a modest distribution fee.

And after the three years?

395
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:40,892
We'll grow your volume.

396
00:26:41,392 --> 00:26:45,897
Your profits in three years
will be 35 to 40 million.

397
00:26:46,272 --> 00:26:48,691
After three years,
I'm sure you'll be pleased

398
00:26:48,858 --> 00:26:51,194
and quite willing to
re-negotiate our fee.

399

independents to join our association.

I told you,
don't fuck with these people.

BEN: Dennis, you step out that
car, I'm coming down to San Diego

to introduce myself
to your district supervisor.

And don't even think about calling
someone and having us disappear

in other people's hands.

end up in the same prison cell.

When Hillary Clinton grows up,
she wants to be Elena Sanchez.

I see dead people.

But in the reality-based community,
there's always a weakness.

Do you know this El Azul guy?

for years, and now he's out.

He's in, she's done.

01:03:45,072 --> 01:03:47,950
There was a bust in Baja,
the largest grow ever.

A quarter of a million plants.
It's hers.

She's losing men, she's losing
money like a BP oil spill.

That's why she's coming up and
moving in on indie guys like you.

She got a house up here?

even think about it.

952

She's got security, like, beyond
the American fucking embassy.

953

Two sons, dead.

955

She's got a son in Mexico City.
He's some playboy, he's alive.

01:32:00,266 --> 01:32:04,353
First of all,
those $3 million?

1385
01:32:04,520 --> 01:32:06,856

Yeah, you, too.

1386

you're going to find me...

...that gave up our

I had a job for a while. I was
a hostess at a restaurant.

1393
01:32:49,857 --> 01:32:53,402
I went to community college
for a semester and a half.

1394
01:32:53,569 --> 01:32:56,780
But then I left, because
institutions make me crazy.

1395
01:32:56,947 --> 01:33:00,618
And I thought, I don't know, I
wanted to experience something real.

1396
01:33:01,160 --> 01:33:04,330
I figured I just
wanted to drown in life.

my asking, ma'am.

1405
01:33:37,905 --> 01:33:41,116
You could say that
I inherited the position.

1406
01:33:41,283 --> 01:33:44,495
When they killed my husband,
whom I love very much,

1407
01:33:44,662 --> 01:33:46,413
I had no choice.

My twin sons were murdered.

1410
01:33:55,047 --> 01:33:58,509
So, I have devoted my life
to my surviving children.

talk to your kids?

1412
01:34:04,682 --> 01:34:07,434
My son hates me,
because I took his power away.

1413
01:34:07,601 --> 01:34:09,061
They would have
killed him, too.

1414
01:34:09,937 --> 01:34:11,647
And my daughter,

1415
01:34:12,439 --> 01:34:16,694
she's ashamed of me.
And I am proud of her for it.

1416
01:34:18,988 --> 01:34:20,948
I'm sorry.

1417

01:45:17,354 --> 01:45:20,023
I will drive them here

1555
01:45:20,232 --> 01:45:22,275
and I will cut them open

1556
01:45:22,442 --> 01:45:25,362
and make them bleed
to death in front of you.

1557
01:45:25,904 --> 01:45:28,281
Yes or no?

1558
01:45:28,448 --> 01:45:30,617
What's it going to be?

1559
01:45:33,745 --> 01:45:35,080
(IN SPANISH)

1560
01:45:35,580 --> 01:45:37,707
Finally. Louder.

1561
01:45:44,130 --> 01:45:45,465
Louder!

1562

<i>What do you want

1568
01:46:05,735 --> 01:46:07,404
The soft one.

Mr. "Nothing Personal."

1570
01:46:10,532 --> 01:46:13,410
He must finish
what he started.

1571
01:46:18,623 --> 01:46:19,624
Sit her down.

1572
01:46:21,543 --> 01:46:26,756
Your men have brought some serious
accusations against one of my men.

1573
01:46:28,466 --> 01:46:30,969
This is our way of justice.

1574
01:46:34,597 --> 01:46:36,141
For the love of God!

1575
01:46:43,231 --> 01:46:47,777
A man takes care of his
family, and I respect that.

<i>I'd like to give
you a better death.</i>

1577

But it would
set a bad example.

No, no, no!

1579
01:47:00,498 --> 01:47:02,000
I don't like the screaming.

1580
01:47:02,167 --> 01:47:03,168
Oh, God!

1581
01:47:10,508 --> 01:47:11,926
Beach Boy.

1582
01:47:15,347 --> 01:47:17,766
No? He took your money, too.

1583

<i>”La Reina”</i> says to do it.

1584

Elena, please...

1585
01:47:27,400 --> 01:47:28,777
Make her watch.

1586
01:47:30,236 --> 01:47:31,363
Let me do it.

1587
01:47:32,113 --> 01:47:34,449
Not you, "Caviar."

1588
01:47:34,616 --> 01:47:36,743
It's my gift to him.

1589
01:48:52,193 --> 01:48:54,362
So, I read up on your Buddha.

1590
01:48:54,529 --> 01:48:56,114
According to the Dalai Lama,

1591
01:48:57,115 --> 01:49:00,285
if you are in a position
to prevent greater violence,

1592
01:49:00,452 --> 01:49:04,080
strike first and strike fast.

1593
01:49:06,458 --> 01:49:08,585
Alex kidnapped people, Ben.

1594
01:49:08,751 --> 01:49:11,463
He had people
tortured and killed.

1595
01:49:11,629 --> 01:49:13,798
So have we.

1596
01:49:18,761 --> 01:49:21,473
Dennis fucked us
on those files.

1597
01:49:23,433 --> 01:49:25,768
When Alex was up there,

1598
01:49:25,935 --> 01:49:30,190
he begged Elena on the head
of Magda, her daughter.

1599
01:49:30,356 --> 01:49:32,692
Which means
she must be alive.

1600
01:49:32,859 --> 01:49:35,487
And Dennis knows.

1601
01:49:35,653 --> 01:49:36,654
Yeah.

1602
01:49:36,821 --> 01:49:37,822
We're short three mil.

1603
01:49:38,865 --> 01:49:40,992
Another hit
is problematic.

1604
01:49:42,035 --> 01:49:44,787
We have got to squeeze it
out of Dennis somehow.

1605
01:49:44,954 --> 01:49:47,165
Find her and trade her.

1606
01:49:47,332 --> 01:49:49,167
You mean, "Kidnap."

1607
01:49:51,377 --> 01:49:53,171
BEN:<i> The same as O.</i>

1608
01:49:54,339 --> 01:49:56,549
You up for that?
Yeah.

1609
01:49:57,967 --> 01:49:59,636
I am.

1610
01:50:05,475 --> 01:50:07,852
Daddy, there's a man
here to see you.

1611
01:50:08,019 --> 01:50:09,187
What man?

1612
01:50:09,354 --> 01:50:10,522
I don't know.

1613
01:50:18,196 --> 01:50:20,365
I was driving by
your neighborgood

1614
01:50:20,532 --> 01:50:23,034
and noticed that your yard
needs some trimming.

1615
01:50:23,868 --> 01:50:27,080
My crew would like to give you
a free haircut today.

1616
01:50:27,830 --> 01:50:30,208
My wife usually
takes care of that stuff.

1617
01:50:31,876 --> 01:50:33,211
Sarah, Hannah,
go to your room right now.

1618
01:50:33,378 --> 01:50:34,921
But, Daddy...
No "buts," no nothing. Go.

1619
01:50:35,088 --> 01:50:36,548
Papa says, "Go."

1620
01:50:39,884 --> 01:50:43,054
Lado! You come to my house?

1621
01:50:43,221 --> 01:50:45,223
You threaten my daughters?

1622
01:50:45,390 --> 01:50:46,891
You don't think I'm
the kind of guy that

1623
01:50:47,058 --> 01:50:48,560
doesn't have cameras
all over the place?

1624
01:50:48,726 --> 01:50:50,812
It don't matter to me.

1625
01:50:50,979 --> 01:50:53,940
After I whack you and your
daughters, I'll burn the house down.

1626
01:50:54,440 --> 01:50:56,943
Come on, you found
your fucking snitch.

1627
01:50:57,110 --> 01:50:58,278
You found him.

1628
01:51:04,826 --> 01:51:06,911
What happened to your hand?

1629
01:51:07,036 --> 01:51:08,288
(ENGINE REVVING)

1630
01:51:11,082 --> 01:51:12,500
DENNIS: Got it caught
in a weed whacker.

1631
01:51:12,834 --> 01:51:13,918
Weed whacker?

1632
01:51:14,043 --> 01:51:15,128
Yeah.

1633
01:51:15,295 --> 01:51:17,463
"Weed whacker," my ass.

1634
01:51:24,137 --> 01:51:26,306
We need to have
a conversation.

1635
01:51:26,472 --> 01:51:28,641
Because I'm confused about
some of your actions, Dennis.

1636
01:51:28,808 --> 01:51:30,143
Like what?

1637
01:51:30,310 --> 01:51:32,854
Like you giving Ben and Chon
all that information.

1638
01:51:33,021 --> 01:51:34,606
You must be smoking
your own shit now, man.

1639
01:51:34,772 --> 01:51:37,191
You got to know
I'm your man.

1640
01:51:37,442 --> 01:51:39,611
I got you your
green card, okay?

1641
01:51:39,777 --> 01:51:41,613
I've been protecting you
for six fucking years.

1642
01:51:41,779 --> 01:51:43,114
Now that shit
hits the fan,

1643
01:51:43,281 --> 01:51:45,867
you got seven dead beaners, you
got a white lawyer in Laguna,

1644
01:51:46,034 --> 01:51:47,910
you need me now
more than ever.

1645
01:51:48,077 --> 01:51:49,495
Stop begging.

1646
01:51:49,787 --> 01:51:50,788
You sound like a woman.

1647
01:51:54,917 --> 01:51:58,338
Dennis,
I know you gave them stuff.

1648
01:51:59,047 --> 01:52:01,257
What makes you so goddamn
sure it's not Azul?

1649
01:52:01,424 --> 01:52:02,425
Because I know it wasn't him.

1650
01:52:02,508 --> 01:52:03,551
What do you mean?

1651
01:52:03,635 --> 01:52:05,178
Because I'm working
with him now, <i>anfibio.</i>

1652
01:52:05,261 --> 01:52:06,262
What?

1653
01:52:06,346 --> 01:52:07,639
And you lie to
me one more time,

1654
01:52:07,764 --> 01:52:09,057
motherfucker,
I will shoot you down.

1655
01:52:09,223 --> 01:52:11,059
Since when have you
been working with Azul?

1656
01:52:11,225 --> 01:52:12,602
You're not going
to tell me that?

1657
01:52:14,812 --> 01:52:16,105
Since two days ago.

1658
01:52:20,985 --> 01:52:24,280
I never gave them you, Lado.
They had me.

1659
01:52:24,447 --> 01:52:28,159
I'd be out of business.
I'd be useless to you.

1660
01:52:28,868 --> 01:52:32,830
I never thought this Iraq psycho
would go nuts on you guys.

1661
01:52:33,122 --> 01:52:35,583
I never gave you up, ever!

1662
01:52:36,334 --> 01:52:39,379
I'm your best friend
on this side, man.

1663
01:52:40,213 --> 01:52:41,881
Did you tell them I
was your little snitch?

1664
01:52:42,048 --> 01:52:44,133
What are you, crazy?
What would be in it for me?

1665
01:52:44,217 --> 01:52:45,259
Answer me, Dennis.

1666
01:52:45,343 --> 01:52:47,887
I gave them enough to just get
them off my fucking ass...

1667
01:52:48,054 --> 01:52:49,347
Yes or no?
No!

1668
01:52:49,514 --> 01:52:52,016
No, okay? No. No.

1669
01:52:52,934 --> 01:52:56,020
It's all about you and me,
and that's it!

1670
01:52:56,187 --> 01:52:58,564
You have got to
believe me this time, man.

1671
01:52:59,774 --> 01:53:02,443
I don't want to
lose this shit!

1672
01:53:02,610 --> 01:53:05,113
I got two fucking kids
and a wife that's dying.

1673
01:53:06,072 --> 01:53:09,534
Thank you, Dennis.
Now they got my $3 million.

1674
01:53:09,701 --> 01:53:10,952
And I want that money.

1675
01:53:11,119 --> 01:53:13,079
It's my money! It's my money!

1676
01:53:13,246 --> 01:53:15,540
Fuckers. You can't trust
anybody no more. Fuck!

1677
01:53:15,707 --> 01:53:18,501
I can't even
trust my fucking wife.

1678
01:53:18,668 --> 01:53:20,545
She's looking to
divorce me, you know?

1679
01:53:21,796 --> 01:53:25,174
My wife's barely breathing.
Welcome to midlife crisis, buddy.

1680
01:53:25,341 --> 01:53:28,136
How do you know you can
trust this Azul guy?

1681
01:53:28,302 --> 01:53:29,345
I mean, come on.

1682
01:53:29,429 --> 01:53:31,973
Has he given you a piece of the business?
Is that what he promised you?

1683
01:53:32,140 --> 01:53:34,684
Because Elena is not
going to fold that easy.

1684
01:53:34,851 --> 01:53:36,519
You know, that three
million is her money.

1685
01:53:36,686 --> 01:53:38,646
Now, don't be a knucklehead.
Think.

1686
01:53:38,855 --> 01:53:41,858
Fuck you.
You think, you fucked it up.

1687
01:53:42,024 --> 01:53:43,359
How are you going to
get me back my money?

1688

(STAMMERS)

1689
01:53:45,194 --> 01:53:47,280
You need me. I'm going
to get you your money.

1690
01:53:47,447 --> 01:53:49,741
But they need the girl.
The guys want this girl.

1691
01:53:49,907 --> 01:53:51,617
They're in fucking love
with this chick.

1692
01:53:51,784 --> 01:53:55,329
And they want O, okay?
So, where is she?

1693
01:53:56,581 --> 01:53:58,040
I don't have her.

1694
01:53:58,207 --> 01:53:59,834
What do you mean,
you "don't have her"?

1695
01:54:00,001 --> 01:54:01,419
Where is she?

1696
01:54:01,836 --> 01:54:02,837
With Elena.

1697
01:54:03,004 --> 01:54:04,005
In Mexico?

1698
01:54:04,172 --> 01:54:05,465
No, here.
Here?

1699
01:54:05,631 --> 01:54:07,091
Some fucking
Indian reservation.

1700
01:54:07,258 --> 01:54:08,718
Elena came to
see her daughter.

1701
01:54:08,885 --> 01:54:11,846
An now that woman is in my face,
telling me what to do, provoking me.

1702
01:54:12,013 --> 01:54:14,390
Oh, this is big, man.

1703
01:54:14,557 --> 01:54:16,476
<i>”La Reina"</i> Elena
is on US soil?

1704
01:54:16,642 --> 01:54:18,853
I told you, it's Indian land.
She's protected.

1705
01:54:19,020 --> 01:54:22,315
And I'm going to fix that. That's
why you need Dennis. Think.

1706
01:54:22,607 --> 01:54:24,442
Stop telling me to think.
No, no, no, man.

1707
01:54:24,525 --> 01:54:26,861
Look, these guys,
they got the three million.

1708
01:54:27,028 --> 01:54:28,279
What do you think
they're going to do with it?

1709
01:54:28,446 --> 01:54:31,365
They're going to fucking
give it to Elena, right?

1710
01:54:31,741 --> 01:54:35,411
And we, first, are going to
sell them Elena's daughter.

1711
01:54:35,578 --> 01:54:38,331
We split the profits,
and then we fuck Elena!

You deserve every fucking
inch of your pain, asshole.

02:09:57,874 --> 02:10:00,127
<i>Hold on.
We'll be there in 10 or less.</i>

1898
02:10:01,211 --> 02:10:02,712
Chon?

1899
02:10:04,965 --> 02:10:06,216
Please, help him.

1901
02:10:16,393 --> 02:10:17,894
OPHELIA: Shh... It's okay.

1902
02:10:18,603 --> 02:10:19,604
It's okay.

1903
02:10:23,066 --> 02:10:24,734
He's going to die.

1904
02:10:27,070 --> 02:10:29,406
Chon,
I don't want to leave him.

1905
02:10:30,824 --> 02:10:31,825
No.

(GASPS)

1907
02:10:52,929 --> 02:10:55,932
You're really
going to love it there.

1908
02:10:57,476 --> 02:11:00,770
Soft water.

1909
02:11:01,438 --> 02:11:03,315
Stars.

1910
02:11:03,940 --> 02:11:05,984
And the people

(ALL GASPING)

1913
02:11:24,711 --> 02:11:26,463
I'm cold.

1914
02:11:40,894 --> 02:11:43,730
OPHELIA:<i> That's the way
I imagined it.</i>

1915
02:11:44,064 --> 02:11:46,858
<i>But the truth has</i>
a <i>mind of its own.</i>

1916
02:11:54,533 --> 02:11:58,495
<i>What really happened was more
of a fuck-up than a shoot-out.</i>

1917
02:11:58,954 --> 02:12:01,998
<i>And gave us all
a second chance.</i>

1918
02:12:32,112 --> 02:12:33,989
CHON: We said
"alone," Elena.

1919
02:12:34,364 --> 02:12:38,618
I am one, you are two. Let's
just do what we came to do.

1920
02:12:42,122 --> 02:12:43,373
And the snipers.

1921
02:12:46,209 --> 02:12:48,753
Tell them to put the scopes on
the ground, hands in the air.

1922
02:12:48,920 --> 02:12:51,464
Or we're back in
the jeep and we're gone.

1923
02:12:54,301 --> 02:12:55,844
Get rid of them.

1924
02:13:01,808 --> 02:13:03,643
ELENA: So how do you
want to do this?

1925
02:13:04,686 --> 02:13:06,187

Go, go!

1929

Magda!

1930
02:13:21,536 --> 02:13:24,080
OPHELIA:<i> And old Dennis, who couldn't
leave town with his three mil</i>

1932

Go! Go!

1933
02:13:31,338 --> 02:13:32,339
Run!

1934
02:13:35,467 --> 02:13:37,677
<i>”La Reina" Elena!</i>

1935
02:13:37,844 --> 02:13:39,304
We gotcha!

DENNIS:<i> Today,
we have made great strides</i>

1937
02:13:50,357 --> 02:13:53,777
<i>to further protect our
children and our freedoms.</i>

1938
02:13:53,943 --> 02:13:57,072
OPHELIA:<i> And Dennis sure made a
big shot of himself on the news.</i>

1939
02:13:57,238 --> 02:14:01,368
<i>By dismantling the leadership
of the Baja cartel</i>

1940
02:14:01,576 --> 02:14:03,995
<i>and the curse of
illicit drugs in our country.</i>

1941
02:14:04,204 --> 02:14:08,124
<i>It is an Indian reservation. It
is technically not our country.</i>

1942
02:14:08,291 --> 02:14:11,503
<i>But, as we know, it is.</i>
(LAUGHS) <i>So...</i>

1943
02:14:11,670 --> 02:14:15,632
OPHELIA:<i> Elena took the fall and
went to prison for 30 years.</i>

1944
02:14:16,591 --> 02:14:18,301
<i>With Elena
out of the picture,</i>

1945
02:14:18,385 --> 02:14:20,178
<i>and Dennis
running interference,</i>

1946
02:14:20,929 --> 02:14:24,516
<i>Lado and Azul
created a new cartel.</i>

1947
02:14:24,683 --> 02:14:26,351
<i>The Azulatos.</i>

1948
02:14:27,977 --> 02:14:31,898
<i>Ben being Ben,
he had the goods on Dennis.</i>

1949
02:14:32,065 --> 02:14:36,152
<i>And Dennis, identifying Ben and
Chon as his confidential informants</i>

1950
02:14:36,319 --> 02:14:39,989
<i>for the last six years,
took care of them.</i>

1951
02:14:40,532 --> 02:14:42,826
<i>But who really trusted who?</i>

1952
02:14:43,618 --> 02:14:45,245
<i>I have no idea.</i>

1953
02:14:45,912 --> 02:14:48,289
<i>Ben and Chon spent a couple
of weeks in the slammer</i>

1954
02:14:48,456 --> 02:14:52,669
<i>and then, well, vanished.</i>

1955
02:14:53,420 --> 02:14:54,629
<i>Like I did.</i>

1956
02:15:02,721 --> 02:15:04,806
<i>They say we're in Africa</i>

1957

<i>off Kenya.</i>

1958
02:15:09,519 --> 02:15:12,939
<i>Or some magic
island in Indonesia.</i>

1959
02:15:18,778 --> 02:15:21,573
<i>They still talk about
Ben and Chon's herb.</i>

1960
02:15:25,910 --> 02:15:29,247
<i>And it surfaces every now
and then over the years.</i>

1961
02:15:35,879 --> 02:15:38,465
<i>These things that happened...</i>

1962
02:15:40,300 --> 02:15:42,469
<i>You can never go back.</i>

1963
02:15:51,060 --> 02:15:53,062
<i>It took me a while,</i>

1964
02:15:53,772 --> 02:15:56,149
<i>but I began to live again.</i>

1965
02:16:05,241 --> 02:16:10,538
<i>I'm not so sure there can ever
be three people equally in love.</i>

1966
02:16:10,705 --> 02:16:12,540
<i>It just doesn't work that way.</i>

1967
02:16:15,919 --> 02:16:19,005
<i>I looked up
the definition of ”savage.”</i>

1968
02:16:20,131 --> 02:16:23,259
<i>It means, "Cruel, crippled."</i>

1969
02:16:24,260 --> 02:16:28,097
<i>”Regressed back to
a primal state of being.”</i>

1970
02:16:31,935 --> 02:16:36,147
<i>One day, maybe,
we'll be back.</i>

1971
02:16:42,278 --> 02:16:46,991
<i>For now,
we live like savages.</i>

1972
02:16:48,326 --> 02:16:49,910
<i>Beautiful savages.</i>
