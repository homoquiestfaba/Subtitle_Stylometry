Let me see you, man.

63
00:07:11,463 --> 00:07:13,864
Hey, Jazz, do me
a favor. Keep an eye
out on him, all right?

64
00:07:13,866 --> 00:07:17,535
He's too old to be out here
in the first place, you know?

65
00:07:17,537 --> 00:07:19,437
Yeah, we got him.

66
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:20,338
I'ma put some feelers out

67
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:22,740
and tell the boys
to look out for these guys.

68
00:07:22,742 --> 00:07:23,908

Black, white--

00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:26,444
-Latino. Yeah.
-Some Spanish niggers?

70
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:31,515
Yeah, well, we're gonna
La Cucaracha their ass
when we catch him.

71
00:07:32,651 --> 00:07:34,552
-Thanks, Pope.
-Right on, baby. Stay up!

72
00:07:34,554 --> 00:07:38,489
-Look after yourselves.
-Take it easy, man.

73
00:07:41,827 --> 00:07:43,527
Hey, Pope.

74
00:07:44,796 --> 00:07:46,364
Hey.

75
00:07:47,666 --> 00:07:51,936
So-- yeah, they, uh--

76
00:07:51,938 --> 00:07:53,971
they took my sleeping bag.

77
00:07:54,673 --> 00:07:56,841
That's fucked up, man.

78
00:07:56,942 --> 00:07:59,744
Yeah, it gets really
cold out here at night.

79
00:07:59,746 --> 00:08:04,048
Yeah? What?
You want me to go buy you
a brand new sleeping bag?

80
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:05,116
That would be nice, right?

81
00:08:05,118 --> 00:08:08,386
Look, I'm a minute
off the streets
my damned self, okay?

82
00:08:08,388 --> 00:08:09,920
No, no.
I'm sorry.
I-- no.

83
00:08:09,922 --> 00:08:11,655
-Sorry, man, you know.
-Thank you, though.

84
00:08:11,657 --> 00:08:14,492
All right, man. I can't
do nothing for you.

85
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:16,394
No, I got it.

86
00:08:23,068 --> 00:08:26,003
[clicks tongue, mutters]

87
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:27,471
[honks]

88
00:08:27,473 --> 00:08:28,873
Hey!

89
00:08:29,941 --> 00:08:32,977
-Hey, Pope.
-Look, nigga...

90
00:08:35,414 --> 00:08:36,480
I'm gonna give
you this, all right?

91
00:08:36,482 --> 00:08:40,918
Now, I'm letting you hold it.
But when you find something
else I want that back, okay?

92
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:44,488
-Okay.
-And I swear to God
if it smells like piss,

93
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:45,689
I will run your ass over.

94
00:08:45,691 --> 00:08:49,093
Oh, there won't be
any piss on it.

95
00:08:49,095 --> 00:08:49,960
Thank you.

96
00:08:49,962 --> 00:08:51,829
Yeah, all right, man.

97
00:08:51,831 --> 00:08:53,664
Hey, um...

98
00:08:56,802 --> 00:08:58,836
-What?
-How are you doing?

99
00:08:58,838 --> 00:09:02,673
Nigger, I can't spend
my whole day out here
talking to your ass.

100
00:09:02,675 --> 00:09:05,976
Man, I got shit to do,
and I already gave you
the fucking blanket.

101
00:09:05,978 --> 00:09:07,011
What? You want me
to change my mind?

102
00:09:07,013 --> 00:09:11,048
-No.
-Keep fucking around
I'm taking my shit back, man.

103
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:12,716
See you later.

104
00:09:58,597 --> 00:10:02,867
You can have it all.
It's-- it's all burned.

105
00:10:05,570 --> 00:10:07,938
All burned up.

106
00:10:46,278 --> 00:10:49,780
[girl's voice] Dear diary,
I am in the second grade.

107
00:10:49,782 --> 00:10:55,586
Mommy gave me this diary
on the Christmas before
she went to heaven.

108
00:10:55,588 --> 00:10:57,922
She told me to write
in it every day,

109
00:10:57,924 --> 00:11:00,658
because every day
of my life would be special.

110
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:05,596
I asked her, "Why?"
And she said because she
loved me more than life itself.

111
00:11:05,598 --> 00:11:10,868
And when someone loves you
that much, then you're
special "automcly."

112
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:17,107
When I get to heaven,
I want to be able to tell her
about every day I was alive,

113
00:11:17,109 --> 00:11:19,643
and I don't want
to forget anything.

114
00:11:19,645 --> 00:11:22,346
I will even tell her
about the days I was bad

115
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:25,816
and the days that
I didn't do anything at all.

116
00:11:25,818 --> 00:11:29,587
So, today, I started
my diary, of course...

117
00:11:29,589 --> 00:11:32,256
and now I'm going to sleep.

118
00:11:47,372 --> 00:11:48,973
Excuse me.

119
00:11:49,207 --> 00:11:51,375
Do you know
how to read cursive?

120
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:53,611
Do you know
how to read this?

121
00:11:53,613 --> 00:11:56,246
Get the fuck
out of here.
Move on.

122
00:12:21,172 --> 00:12:24,908
[Man] Heavenly father,
I know I've made some
mistakes in my life.

123
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:27,778
I know I've done some--
some bad things.

124
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:30,648
I'm a sinner
and I deserve
to go to hell.

125
00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:33,384
But you sent your son
to forgive me for my sins.

126
00:12:33,386 --> 00:12:40,824
And today, Jesus, I accept you
into my heart as my personal
lord and savior.

127
00:12:41,393 --> 00:12:44,061
You can open
your eyes now.

128
00:12:44,396 --> 00:12:46,096
You've been saved.

129
00:12:47,365 --> 00:12:49,733
Here, this is yours.

130
00:12:53,104 --> 00:12:55,272
I'll look for you in heaven.

131
00:12:58,910 --> 00:13:00,110
Ma'am.
Hi, how are you?

132
00:13:00,112 --> 00:13:05,249
Excuse me. Can you read
out of this book it--
it's in cursive.

133
00:13:05,251 --> 00:13:07,818
I can't, right now. I'm--

134
00:13:08,353 --> 00:13:10,020
Read the Bible.

135
00:13:11,156 --> 00:13:14,892
Hi, ma'am. Do you believe
in God by any chance?

136
00:13:15,927 --> 00:13:16,994
Good.

137
00:13:16,996 --> 00:13:21,398
I'd like to, uh--
I'd like to show you a verse
here from the Bible.

138
00:13:22,967 --> 00:13:26,370
It's John 3:16.
You know who John was?

139
00:13:51,262 --> 00:13:54,898
-Mommy, something stinks.
-[shushing]

140
00:13:58,503 --> 00:14:01,171
If you would pay
for these cards, uh--

141
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:03,173
uh, I know I smell bad.

142
00:14:03,175 --> 00:14:05,876
And I, uh--
I'll wait outside.

143
00:14:24,229 --> 00:14:25,763
Thank you.

144
00:14:45,283 --> 00:14:48,385
[girl's voice] It thundered
the night my mom died.

145
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:51,088
I'm afraid of thunder.

146
00:14:55,426 --> 00:14:58,295
I'm afraid of thunder, too.

147
00:15:00,565 --> 00:15:03,801
[thunder rumbling]

148
00:15:37,068 --> 00:15:39,002
[Willie's voice]
My name is Willie.

149
00:15:39,004 --> 00:15:43,240
I found your diary
and thought I would
write you back

150
00:15:43,242 --> 00:15:44,875
if you don't mind.

151
00:15:44,877 --> 00:15:46,443
Maybe, we could
be pen pals.

152
00:15:46,445 --> 00:15:52,449
But to do that,
I guess I have to tell you
a little bit about myself.

153
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:54,585
I live on the nickel.

154
00:15:54,587 --> 00:15:58,322
In the morning
I wake up when
the sun comes out

155
00:15:58,324 --> 00:16:00,424
and go look for food.

156
00:16:00,426 --> 00:16:06,496
I'm always so hungry
in the morning. I will
eat just about anything.

157
00:16:06,498 --> 00:16:11,501
After that, I walk around
trying to get money.

158
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:14,238
Sometimes I just
go exploring.

159
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,906
I like to climb stuff.

160
00:16:15,908 --> 00:16:19,076
I found this roof
I can climb up to.

161
00:16:19,078 --> 00:16:24,548
You can see
the whole city
for a long, long way.

162
00:16:27,552 --> 00:16:32,055
When it gets real hot,
I sleep in my box.

163
00:16:32,891 --> 00:16:34,291
It's a good box.

164
00:16:34,293 --> 00:16:41,164
And sometimes I sleep almost
all day because I stay up
so late at night.

165
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,333
It's really scary at night.

166
00:16:43,335 --> 00:16:47,638
If you sleep,
somebody might do
something bad to you.

167
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:54,177
These guys, they took my
sleeping bag one time and now
it's really cold at night,

168
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:56,413
which also makes me sad.

169
00:16:56,547 --> 00:17:01,385
So, I am what is called
a "night owl" right now.

170
00:17:01,419 --> 00:17:05,689
It is usually quiet,
but it is lonely.

171
00:17:06,658 --> 00:17:09,960
You're the only
person I know.

172
00:17:10,561 --> 00:17:13,263
So, that makes you special...

173
00:17:13,265 --> 00:17:15,065
"automcly."

174
00:17:21,472 --> 00:17:22,973
P.S...

175
00:17:23,308 --> 00:17:26,443
I am afraid of thunder, too.

176
00:17:47,265 --> 00:17:49,199
[girl's voice] Dear diary...

177
00:17:49,367 --> 00:17:52,536
today was my first day
at my new school.

178
00:17:56,107 --> 00:17:59,676
I'm living with Uncle Craig
in his apartment downtown,

179
00:17:59,678 --> 00:18:02,145
and I don't know
anybody here.

180
00:18:02,147 --> 00:18:03,447
What?

181
00:18:05,616 --> 00:18:07,551
Back! This is my spot now.

182
00:18:07,553 --> 00:18:09,686
Go and find
your own damn spot.

183
00:18:09,688 --> 00:18:12,022
Who wants your shit?

184
00:18:12,024 --> 00:18:14,191
[girl's voice] Everyone
stares at me weird,

185
00:18:14,193 --> 00:18:16,126
and I don't like it.

186
00:18:21,366 --> 00:18:25,002
There are a few kids
I want to make friends with...

187
00:18:26,037 --> 00:18:28,438
but they don't know I exist.

188
00:18:29,741 --> 00:18:32,642
When Mommy was sick,
I used to hug her,

189
00:18:32,644 --> 00:18:35,645
and she said
it made everything okay.

190
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:38,482
She promised that
whenever I get lonely

191
00:18:38,484 --> 00:18:41,418
she will send
an angel down
to hug me.

192
00:18:43,154 --> 00:18:45,355
But I haven't seen him yet.

193
00:18:46,457 --> 00:18:48,759
[man] Hey, who
wants 50 bucks?

194
00:18:50,128 --> 00:18:52,429
Yo, who wants 50 bucks?

195
00:18:52,530 --> 00:18:57,401
-Get in fights a lot?
-[Skillet] Get in 'em?
I start 'em!

196
00:18:57,403 --> 00:18:58,602
Ask anybody on this row,

197
00:18:58,604 --> 00:19:00,037
anybody in this
whole fucking city,

198
00:19:00,039 --> 00:19:03,774
and they'll tell you,
"Skillet the killer,
motherfucker."

199
00:19:03,776 --> 00:19:04,808
You kill people?

200
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:06,610
[Skillet]
Yeah, I kill them.

201
00:19:07,111 --> 00:19:08,478
Beat 'em, eat 'em.

202
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,780
Anybody-- ask any one of these--

203
00:19:09,782 --> 00:19:12,249
pick any one of these
sorry motherfuckers,

204
00:19:12,251 --> 00:19:15,052
-any one of them...
-[guys chuckle]

205
00:19:15,054 --> 00:19:17,454
and I'll beat their ass.

206
00:19:17,456 --> 00:19:19,156
Yeah, how much?

207
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:20,524
What do you
mean "how much"?

208
00:19:20,526 --> 00:19:24,828
How much-- how much to see you
fight somebody right now?

209
00:19:25,630 --> 00:19:29,466
Right now? Shit.
How much you got?

210
00:19:29,468 --> 00:19:30,634
I got $50.

211
00:19:30,636 --> 00:19:33,170
Get the fuck out of here,
get off of my row.

212
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:35,105
There's no fight.
$50 ain't shit.

213
00:19:35,107 --> 00:19:38,475
Sure, it is.
Hey, who wants
50 bucks, huh?

214
00:19:38,477 --> 00:19:42,746
Raise your hand
if you want 50 bucks.

215
00:19:42,748 --> 00:19:44,347
Hmm?

216
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:47,784
Anybody?

217
00:19:54,158 --> 00:19:56,093
Hey, buddy.

218
00:19:56,294 --> 00:19:59,663
You wanna make
some money? Huh?

219
00:19:59,665 --> 00:20:00,430
What do you say?

220
00:20:00,432 --> 00:20:02,833
Come on. You go--
you wanna make a 50?

221
00:20:02,835 --> 00:20:05,168
Dead motherfucker!

222
00:20:05,170 --> 00:20:07,404

Yo, yo, dude, we're on!
We're on! Fucking film

224
00:20:10,742 --> 00:20:13,276
Whoa! Fucking film!

225
00:20:13,678 --> 00:20:16,246
[Willie grunting]

226
00:20:20,785 --> 00:20:22,352
Come on!

227
00:20:23,154 --> 00:20:24,421
Jesus!

228
00:20:27,358 --> 00:20:28,625
[spits]

229
00:20:30,361 --> 00:20:32,162
[screaming]

230
00:20:32,430 --> 00:20:34,397
Dead motherfucker.
Get up.

231
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:38,235
[man] No, man, don't let
anybody do that shit to you.

232
00:20:40,671 --> 00:20:44,441
-[man 2] Yo, what's his name?
-[man] Come on, man!

233
00:20:44,443 --> 00:20:45,275
Yeah, man!

234
00:20:45,277 --> 00:20:47,210
[JJ] Hey! Come on, Willie!

235
00:20:47,212 --> 00:20:49,846
You've got to get back up.

236
00:20:49,848 --> 00:20:51,748
[man laughing]

237
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:53,216
Yeah!

238
00:20:54,719 --> 00:20:56,219
[people shouting]

239
00:20:56,221 --> 00:20:59,923
-Yeah.
-Yeah. Hit him
in the face.

240
00:21:01,425 --> 00:21:03,493
[grunting]

241
00:21:06,697 --> 00:21:09,566
[man shouting]
Kill him now!

242
00:21:14,805 --> 00:21:18,642
Dude, he's messing him up
pretty bad. Maybe we should
just call it, huh?

243
00:21:18,644 --> 00:21:20,377
Fucking film.

244
00:21:21,179 --> 00:21:22,279
[man] Get up!

245
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:23,880
[Willie grunting]

246
00:21:23,882 --> 00:21:26,449
Come on, Willie!

247
00:21:38,829 --> 00:21:42,666
Come on, Willie!
Come on, boy!

248
00:21:44,602 --> 00:21:46,870
[groaning]

249
00:21:47,872 --> 00:21:49,406
Yeah.

250
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:58,715
Hey! Hey, that's enough!

251
00:21:58,749 --> 00:22:01,284
That's enough!
He's had enough.

252
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:07,224
Whoo! Willie,
you fucking won! Ha!

253
00:22:07,226 --> 00:22:08,725
Dude, I thought
you were dead

254
00:22:08,727 --> 00:22:12,362
for sure,
motherfucker!
Oh my...

255
00:22:12,763 --> 00:22:14,231
You fucking won, Willie!

256
00:22:14,233 --> 00:22:16,233
[man shouting]
Yo, pay him motherfucker.

257
00:22:16,235 --> 00:22:17,867
[JJ] Yeah, yeah.
No problem.

258
00:22:17,869 --> 00:22:19,636
None whatsoever.

259
00:22:20,905 --> 00:22:22,839
[laughing]

260
00:22:22,841 --> 00:22:23,373
Willie!

261
00:22:23,375 --> 00:22:27,711
Ladies and gentlemen,
please put your hands
together for Willie.

262
00:22:27,713 --> 00:22:32,382
My main man, Willie
the Cardboard Boxer!

[flipping channels]

267
00:24:03,541 --> 00:24:05,942
[car honks]

268
00:24:40,644 --> 00:24:43,380
Hey, man.
You need some help?

269
00:24:44,048 --> 00:24:46,716
-What?
-Here, let me push you.

270
00:24:46,718 --> 00:24:48,818
Get the fuck

271
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:50,487
I got it.

272
00:24:55,893 --> 00:24:58,661
Hey, do you know
how to read cursive?

273
00:24:59,463 --> 00:24:59,996
What?

274
00:24:59,998 --> 00:25:01,064
Do you know how
to read cursive?

275
00:25:01,066 --> 00:25:04,100
Yeah, I know
how to read cursive,
motherfucker.

276
00:25:04,102 --> 00:25:06,970
Then if you read this,
I will push you up the hill.

277
00:25:06,972 --> 00:25:08,705
You wanna read this?
I ain't readin' you shit!

278
00:25:08,707 --> 00:25:12,175
-Hey! Don't do that!
-Get the fuck off of me!

279
00:25:24,755 --> 00:25:26,823
You know where
the pawn shop is?

280
00:25:34,031 --> 00:25:36,666
Aha, you thought
I was lying, right?

281
00:25:36,668 --> 00:25:37,767
Whoa! Is that
really him?

282
00:25:37,769 --> 00:25:40,603
Yeah, it's President
of the United States, bro!

283
00:25:40,605 --> 00:25:42,605
And me, you see that?

284
00:25:42,607 --> 00:25:44,474
You believe that?

285
00:25:44,476 --> 00:25:46,176
I'll show you something.

286
00:25:47,478 --> 00:25:50,513
What! Purple Heart.

287
00:25:50,515 --> 00:25:50,814
Wow!

288
00:25:50,816 --> 00:25:53,616
You know what
the President said
when he gave that to me?

289
00:25:53,618 --> 00:25:55,685
He said, "I thank you
on the behalf

290
00:25:55,687 --> 00:25:57,620
"of the American people.

291
00:25:57,622 --> 00:26:01,558
I thank you for your service.
You're a real life hero, Pinky."

292
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:02,192
"Pinky"?

293
00:26:02,194 --> 00:26:03,626
Yeah, that's my nickname, son.

294
00:26:03,628 --> 00:26:07,730
I told him. I was like,
"You call me anything,
you call me Pinky."

295
00:26:07,732 --> 00:26:08,798
Shit. Can you
believe that, though?

296
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:12,202
You're pushing
an honest-to-God
war hero, motherfucker.

297
00:26:12,204 --> 00:26:14,571
Iraqi War hero.

298
00:26:15,539 --> 00:26:16,673
Why did they
call you "Pinky"?

299
00:26:16,675 --> 00:26:20,810
Because I used
to wear a fucking
dope-ass pinky ring.

300
00:26:20,812 --> 00:26:25,148
But I pawned that shit
just like I wanna
pawn this shit.

301
00:26:25,150 --> 00:26:26,549
Yo, take me in.

302
00:26:26,551 --> 00:26:28,084
Are you out of your
fucking mind, sir?

303
00:26:28,086 --> 00:26:30,253
That's a Purple Heart
right there.

304
00:26:30,255 --> 00:26:31,054
[Pakistani music playing]

305
00:26:31,056 --> 00:26:35,091
You ain't from America,
though, are you? Where
you from, my man?

306
00:26:36,193 --> 00:26:36,793
Pakistan.

307
00:26:36,795 --> 00:26:40,163
Pakistan?
Fucking figures. God!

308
00:26:40,165 --> 00:26:44,667
They only give them
to war heroes. That's a
Purple Heart, right there.

309
00:26:44,669 --> 00:26:46,169
Understand it?
To-- to heroes!

310
00:26:46,171 --> 00:26:48,071
I know what it is.
I'll--

311
00:26:48,073 --> 00:26:51,007
I'll give you $15.

312
00:26:51,609 --> 00:26:56,546
My man you said 50
or 15? Because I know
you said 50. Come on.

313
00:26:56,548 --> 00:26:58,081
-15.
-15?

314
00:26:58,083 --> 00:27:00,550
Very few want to buy this.
It's-- it's worthless.

315
00:27:00,552 --> 00:27:04,821
It's fucking not worthless, man.
It's my legs right there.

316
00:27:05,990 --> 00:27:09,726
You-- you want to--
you want to sell this
to me or not?

317
00:27:25,809 --> 00:27:27,010
Fuck you, man.

318
00:27:27,012 --> 00:27:29,913
Keep your money, bro.
I don't need your money.

319
00:27:29,915 --> 00:27:31,314
Let's go, Willie.

320
00:27:31,316 --> 00:27:33,750
Let's go.
Let's go.

321
00:27:33,752 --> 00:27:35,785
Yo, yo. Let me tell
you something, my man.

322
00:27:35,787 --> 00:27:38,988
This is me and the President
of the United States!

323
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:41,858
A country you
living in right now.

324
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:44,928
Let me ask you something.
Who fucking knows you, bro?

325
00:27:44,930 --> 00:27:46,262
Nobody fucking knows you.

326
00:27:46,264 --> 00:27:50,633
Who knows you? Answer me.
No, nobody fucking knows you.

327
00:27:50,635 --> 00:27:51,234
Fuck you.

328
00:27:51,236 --> 00:27:54,337
Let's go, Willie.
Nobody knows this guy.

329
00:27:54,838 --> 00:27:57,974
You're lucky I don't
come back here, bro.

330
00:28:06,984 --> 00:28:09,886
[Willie]
This chicken looks okay.

331
00:28:10,854 --> 00:28:12,722
It's not bad.

332
00:28:13,724 --> 00:28:18,962
-It's got ants on it.
-I know there's fucking
ants on that shit.

333
00:28:24,068 --> 00:28:26,035
That's an ant.

334
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:39,816
God! You've been over there?

335
00:28:39,818 --> 00:28:41,618
No.

336
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:42,986
Too shy.

337
00:28:45,656 --> 00:28:47,256
How much is it?

338
00:28:47,958 --> 00:28:50,693
$5 for a blow-job.

339
00:28:52,363 --> 00:28:54,897
$10 for a pussy.

340
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:58,334
They're really nice.

341
00:28:59,003 --> 00:29:00,903
Yeah, I bet.

342
00:29:02,373 --> 00:29:04,874
[indistinct talking]

343
00:29:10,714 --> 00:29:14,684
[Pinky] I suppose you gotta
be in the band to get the girl.

344
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:19,689
-You ever play in a band?
-[Jazz] Shit yeah, man!

345
00:29:19,691 --> 00:29:21,057
Played piano.

346
00:29:21,059 --> 00:29:24,293
Opened for the Dramatics
when I was 15.

347
00:29:24,862 --> 00:29:26,696
You ever heard of them?

348
00:29:27,665 --> 00:29:30,233
No. You any good, though?

349
00:29:30,235 --> 00:29:33,336
On piano?
I was good enough.

350
00:29:33,804 --> 00:29:35,838
Wasn't no Mozart
and them.

351
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:39,275
But, shit, you know,
it was just for fun, brother.

352
00:29:39,943 --> 00:29:41,044
Just fun, huh.

353
00:29:41,046 --> 00:29:45,915
Backstage this older girl...
she took me to the bathroom.

354
00:29:45,917 --> 00:29:49,152
Girls' bathroom.
I got to finger her.

355
00:29:49,154 --> 00:29:51,120
[Jazz laughing]

356
00:29:51,122 --> 00:29:52,689
Ah!

357
00:29:54,858 --> 00:29:55,358
[Jazz] Yeah, man.

358
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:59,762
See, that's what
you've got to grasp
on to, little brother.

359
00:30:00,764 --> 00:30:03,166
You gotta filter
through the memories.

360
00:30:03,168 --> 00:30:07,170
Pick the best one
and hold that shit tight.

361
00:30:07,771 --> 00:30:09,972
Let the rest of them
fade away.

362
00:30:11,909 --> 00:30:16,012
What about you, Eavesdrop?
What you want to do, man?

363
00:30:18,215 --> 00:30:22,251
-What?
-You had any dreams
when you was a kid?

364
00:30:24,788 --> 00:30:25,822
Yeah, I used
to dream at night.

365
00:30:25,824 --> 00:30:32,095
Nah, I mean, if you
could have anything
in the world that you want,

366
00:30:32,097 --> 00:30:33,963
what would you want?

367
00:30:40,237 --> 00:30:43,973
I don't want
to be alone
when I die.

368
00:30:48,245 --> 00:30:48,911
[Jazz scoffing]

369
00:30:48,913 --> 00:30:52,782
Shit. You got plenty
of company down here, man.

370
00:30:53,150 --> 00:30:55,885
You couldn't be alone
if you tried.

371
00:30:57,488 --> 00:31:00,523
Believe me,
I've tried.

372
00:31:07,164 --> 00:31:08,998
[girl's voice] Dear diary...

373
00:31:09,466 --> 00:31:11,134
I'm so lonely.

374
00:31:11,869 --> 00:31:13,970
Other kids used to stare...

375
00:31:14,271 --> 00:31:16,539
but now no one
looks at me.

376
00:31:17,775 --> 00:31:19,142
Uncle Craig hates me.

377
00:31:19,144 --> 00:31:23,379
I keep waiting for the angel
Mommy sent to hug me,

378
00:31:23,381 --> 00:31:24,914
but...

379
00:31:25,215 --> 00:31:27,216
there's no one there.

380
00:31:27,218 --> 00:31:28,851
Hey.

381
00:31:50,307 --> 00:31:54,844
[girl's voice] Sometimes
I wonder if Mommy
can even hear me.

382
00:31:54,912 --> 00:31:57,847
Maybe she's not
there either anymore.

383
00:31:57,849 --> 00:32:01,818
Maybe you have
someone in your life
for just a little while.

384
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:05,288
And when they go,
they're gone.

385
00:32:06,990 --> 00:32:09,158
And you're all alone.

386
00:32:13,997 --> 00:32:17,300
[Willie's voice]
I know how it feels
to be lonely.

387
00:32:17,302 --> 00:32:23,539
There have been
long times when I didn't
talk to anyone at all.

388
00:32:24,274 --> 00:32:26,576
Sometimes people
stare at me...

389
00:32:26,578 --> 00:32:29,312
and I don't like it.

390
00:32:29,314 --> 00:32:34,016
But other times,
I wish someone
would see me...

391
00:32:34,551 --> 00:32:37,954
just to know I am here.

392
00:32:38,488 --> 00:32:40,990
But, you started
talking to me...

393
00:32:40,992 --> 00:32:45,628
and then I started
talking to other people.

394
00:32:46,029 --> 00:32:49,365
And now,
I do have friends.

395
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:52,869
You and Pinky.

396
00:32:53,070 --> 00:32:55,271
And if I can
make friends...

397
00:32:55,606 --> 00:32:58,007
then you will
make friends, too.

398
00:33:06,250 --> 00:33:07,950
So, don't worry.

399
00:33:08,619 --> 00:33:10,219
I hear you.

400
00:33:10,287 --> 00:33:15,091
And your mommy...
she can hear you, too.

401
00:33:19,096 --> 00:33:21,264
I know you exist.

402
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:26,636
P.S. There's going
to be thunder, tonight.

403
00:33:26,638 --> 00:33:33,342
Don't be afraid, though,
'cause I'll be with you
the whole time.

404
00:33:33,944 --> 00:33:37,280
Your friend, Willie.

405
00:33:38,282 --> 00:33:41,284
[distant singing]

406
00:33:47,190 --> 00:33:50,693
[fireworks screeching,
exploding]

407
00:34:04,408 --> 00:34:07,243
[singing continues]

408
00:34:08,145 --> 00:34:10,513
[indistinct singing, laughter]

409
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:18,955
-[cheering]
-Happy new year, everybody!

410
00:34:18,957 --> 00:34:21,123
Happy new year!

411
00:34:37,074 --> 00:34:39,475
Yo! Easy.

412
00:34:40,677 --> 00:34:42,979
[Willie grunting]

413
00:34:49,419 --> 00:34:52,188
You know, I wouldn't
smoke in the war.

414
00:34:54,091 --> 00:34:55,524
Mmm-mmm.

415
00:34:58,295 --> 00:34:59,662
Oh, that's real.

416
00:34:59,664 --> 00:35:01,764
Everybody in my unit,
they took up smoking,

417
00:35:01,766 --> 00:35:03,199
because they weren't
thinking long term.

418
00:35:03,201 --> 00:35:07,003
They was all like,
"Shit, I'll be lucky
to die of lung cancer."

419
00:35:07,005 --> 00:35:09,271
I'd be like, "Yeah,
whatever. You 50

420
00:35:09,273 --> 00:35:11,574
"and dyin', and your wife
and your friends
are still chillin'

421
00:35:11,576 --> 00:35:15,111
"with mad time ahead of 'em,
you gon' feel stupid."

422
00:35:15,545 --> 00:35:16,212
"Yo, yo, Pinky,

423
00:35:16,214 --> 00:35:20,116
you could die tomorrow
or your ass could get blown up
by a mortar right now."

424
00:35:20,118 --> 00:35:24,720
"Yeah, but, If I don't,
I want to live to be
an old-ass man."

425
00:35:28,492 --> 00:35:32,628
Now thinking about being
an old-ass man out here...

426
00:35:36,233 --> 00:35:39,435
I'd be lucky to die
of lung cancer.

427
00:35:43,073 --> 00:35:43,372
Shit.

428
00:35:43,374 --> 00:35:47,743
Fucking went out
'cause I was fucking talking.

429
00:35:48,779 --> 00:35:50,212
What do you want
your sign to say?

430
00:35:50,214 --> 00:35:55,317
[mutters]
"Give me you fucking money.
I ain't got no legs."

431
00:35:56,186 --> 00:35:59,789
No. You shouldn't
use bad words.

432
00:36:00,824 --> 00:36:02,191
You should say "Veteran."

433
00:36:02,193 --> 00:36:05,728
Motherfucker, it's my sign.
I get to say what I want to say.

434
00:36:06,430 --> 00:36:08,464
Don't be getting creative.

435
00:36:09,533 --> 00:36:11,567
You should say "War Hero."

436
00:36:19,176 --> 00:36:20,443
Whoo!

437
00:36:25,315 --> 00:36:27,450
Whoa, hey.
Hey, how are
you doing, man?

438
00:36:27,452 --> 00:36:28,784
What's up, brother?
How are you doing, man?

439
00:36:28,786 --> 00:36:31,387
You got-- you got
any money to help
me out a little bit, today?

440
00:36:31,389 --> 00:36:34,123
-[woman] We thank you
for your service.
-All right, all right.

441
00:36:34,125 --> 00:36:36,225
See you, honey.
Thank you, thank you.

442
00:36:36,227 --> 00:36:38,727
Hey, honey.
You got a little bit of cash?

443
00:36:38,729 --> 00:36:41,730
Go ahead. Put it--
put it right here.

444
00:36:42,165 --> 00:36:43,566
If I had a phone,
I'd call you.

445
00:36:43,568 --> 00:36:46,135
If I had a phone,
I'd call you. You know?

446
00:36:46,137 --> 00:36:48,170
Hey, how are you
guys doing tonight?

447
00:36:48,172 --> 00:36:50,272
-Keep that, sir.
-Whoa. I appreciate it.

00:36:50,274 --> 00:36:51,207
-Here.
-Thank you very much.

449
00:36:51,209 --> 00:36:53,509
Thank you. I appreciate it.
You look nice tonight.

450
00:36:53,511 --> 00:36:56,278
You look good.
Thank you.
Thank you.

451
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:58,114
Hey, honey.
How are you doing?

452
00:36:58,116 --> 00:37:01,383
Hey, I appreciate it.
Thank you very much.

453
00:37:01,385 --> 00:37:02,751
Thank you.

454
00:37:04,855 --> 00:37:06,388
Whoo!

455
00:37:08,191 --> 00:37:09,792
Willie!

456
00:37:18,535 --> 00:37:23,839
Hey, my man.
Yo, we want...
one room, two beds.

457
00:37:24,307 --> 00:37:26,242
It's 120 for a night.

458
00:37:26,244 --> 00:37:26,542
What?

459
00:37:26,544 --> 00:37:29,145
What are you
talking about?
Sign says 60.

460
00:37:30,213 --> 00:37:31,914
Not for two person.

461
00:37:36,286 --> 00:37:39,788
Yeah, well.
Just one, then.

462
00:37:39,790 --> 00:37:41,690
[sighs]

463
00:37:46,163 --> 00:37:48,831
[Pinky] Check your sign,
next time.

464
00:37:52,936 --> 00:37:55,771
What-- I got it, man!

465
00:37:55,773 --> 00:37:57,573
I got it.

466
00:38:06,883 --> 00:38:08,617
Good night.

467
00:38:12,589 --> 00:38:14,757
Don't spend
it all on girls.

468
00:38:20,330 --> 00:38:22,498
Peace out, man!

469
00:38:35,779 --> 00:38:36,879
[Pope chuckles] No.

470
00:38:36,881 --> 00:38:38,948
This shit, man.
This ain't me.

471
00:38:38,950 --> 00:38:40,983
Some movie set
over off on Wilshire,

472
00:38:40,985 --> 00:38:43,886
they was about to throw 'em
away, can you believe that?

473
00:38:43,888 --> 00:38:45,521
[Jazz] You bullshitting me.

474
00:38:45,523 --> 00:38:45,821
No, man.

475
00:38:45,823 --> 00:38:50,226
Shit, if I had five loaves
of bread and two fish,
I'd feed all of you.

476
00:38:50,228 --> 00:38:53,629
-Amen.
-Got one left, bro.

477
00:38:54,864 --> 00:38:56,932
Hey, sleeping bag man.

478
00:38:57,801 --> 00:39:00,436
Got one left.
Want it?

479
00:39:00,438 --> 00:39:02,638
Oh, um--

480
00:39:04,841 --> 00:39:07,876
Methuselah, do you
want a sandwich?

481
00:39:08,011 --> 00:39:10,279
[Jazz] Methuselah,
come on over here, man.

482
00:39:10,281 --> 00:39:11,413
Get yourself some meat.

[Jazz] Yeah, you know
what that means.

488
00:39:23,027 --> 00:39:23,626
[Pope] What?

489
00:39:23,628 --> 00:39:25,894

Ain't no bathrooms
tonight. It's all business.

495
00:40:49,079 --> 00:40:53,549
It's five bucks to play,
baby. You got five bucks?

496
00:41:00,390 --> 00:41:01,990
All right.

497

It's okay.

504

So what do you
want to do?

What do you want to do,
then, Santy? Hmm?

Do you--

507

do you think that
you can love me?

d Our way now splits in two,

521
00:42:54,738 --> 00:42:58,006
d But the road I have to run

522
00:42:58,008 --> 00:43:01,176
d Is so long

523
00:43:01,178 --> 00:43:04,079
[people exclaiming]

524
00:43:06,182 --> 00:43:09,618
[man] Hit him again! Hit him!

525
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:12,020
[Willie grunting]

526
00:43:23,166 --> 00:43:25,501
d What to say when

527
00:43:25,503 --> 00:43:28,670

d And in time,

530
00:43:41,251 --> 00:43:43,986
You warm
back there, buddy?

531
00:43:45,188 --> 00:43:46,522
Okay.

532
00:43:46,524 --> 00:43:50,559
So, Evan,
let's talk biz.

533
00:43:50,561 --> 00:43:52,060
Tyler?

534
00:43:58,167 --> 00:44:00,636
[people shouting in video]

535
00:44:01,604 --> 00:44:06,909
If I send you a copy of this
to show some of your buddies,
you think they'd be into it?

536
00:44:08,678 --> 00:44:08,977
Who?

537
00:44:08,979 --> 00:44:12,314
I know you know all those
finance kids and shit, man?

538
00:44:12,316 --> 00:44:14,816
That's who we gotta
get down here, bro.

539
00:44:14,818 --> 00:44:17,185
That's gonna make it an event.

540
00:44:17,187 --> 00:44:19,087
Let's make this big.

541
00:44:19,789 --> 00:44:23,158
Dude, you know how
fucking underground
they're gonna think you are

542
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:23,959
when you show them this?

543
00:44:23,961 --> 00:44:28,230
Everybody's gonna be like,
"Shit, Evan is so street."

544
00:44:29,832 --> 00:44:32,901
For real, bro.
You should think about it.

545
00:44:38,708 --> 00:44:41,176
Hey, Willie-bear.
Here.

546
00:44:41,178 --> 00:44:45,581
Makes me feel good
to put that in your
hand every time, man.

547
00:44:45,583 --> 00:44:46,081
You know that?

548
00:44:46,083 --> 00:44:49,885
I'm spending big money,
but it feels good.

549
00:44:50,353 --> 00:44:52,588
I think it's
'cause I like you.

550
00:44:52,590 --> 00:44:55,157
Like that guy Evan,
who is technically
one of my friends.

551
00:44:55,159 --> 00:44:57,059
I fucking hate that prick.

552
00:44:57,061 --> 00:44:59,361
But you, I, uh--

553
00:44:59,796 --> 00:45:02,998
I know it sounds weird
to call you my friend, but...

554
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,700
I don't know, man. I--

555
00:45:04,702 --> 00:45:07,836
I honestly like you, Willie.

556
00:45:08,204 --> 00:45:13,075
You know why?
I think... you're loyal.

557
00:45:13,176 --> 00:45:17,379
Yeah. But I'm going
to need to count on you.

558
00:45:17,381 --> 00:45:19,881
Can I count on you, Willie?

559
00:45:20,650 --> 00:45:23,685
Yeah. Yeah.

560
00:45:23,853 --> 00:45:26,121
Yeah, you take
good care of me.

561
00:45:26,123 --> 00:45:32,094
Yeah. I know I could.
Bump it.

562
00:45:33,029 --> 00:45:36,965
You're my motherfucking
cardboard boxer, Willie.

563
00:46:30,319 --> 00:46:32,354
[Pinky] Willie.

564
00:46:33,456 --> 00:46:35,857
Help me light this.

565
00:46:52,875 --> 00:46:54,776
How the hell
is it so cold?

566
00:46:54,778 --> 00:46:57,212
You know how like...
how you do in the movies,

567
00:46:57,214 --> 00:47:02,751
put the fire in the trash can.
You ever do that in real life?
[clears throat]

568
00:47:02,753 --> 00:47:04,052
Yeah.

569
00:47:04,420 --> 00:47:07,255
I know where
some of those are.

570
00:47:20,470 --> 00:47:22,237
Do you want me
to read the first page?

571
00:47:22,239 --> 00:47:24,773
No, I know that one
in my sleep.

572
00:47:24,775 --> 00:47:28,110
Read the last page
that she wrote on.

573
00:47:30,012 --> 00:47:34,783
"I realized today
that I didn't even say
a word at school all week.

574
00:47:34,785 --> 00:47:41,757
"Sometimes I am surprised
by how my voice sounds because
I have not heard it in days."

575
00:47:41,759 --> 00:47:45,894
[girl's voice]
Uncle Craig is old and scary.

576
00:47:46,395 --> 00:47:47,996
He drinks beer
and yells at me.

577
00:47:47,998 --> 00:47:52,934
He smokes his cigarettes
until he falls asleep
on the couch.

578
00:47:53,836 --> 00:47:55,103
What is this shit, huh?

579
00:47:55,105 --> 00:47:58,173
You're gonna burn
the house down,
stupid child!

580
00:47:58,175 --> 00:48:03,111
You're not
supposed to be here.
Do you understand that?

581
00:48:03,113 --> 00:48:04,279
Go away!

582
00:48:04,281 --> 00:48:06,214
[girl's voice] I wish
I wasn't here, either.

583
00:48:06,216 --> 00:48:10,819
Sometimes I wish I could have
died with Mommy, when she died.

584
00:48:10,821 --> 00:48:17,058
"My life wouldn't have
had this sad part.

585
00:48:17,560 --> 00:48:19,828
"The longer I am sad,
the harder it is

586
00:48:19,830 --> 00:48:23,999
"to remember anything
ever good happened to me."

587
00:48:25,134 --> 00:48:27,035
[both] I thought
I was just sad...

588
00:48:27,037 --> 00:48:28,270
[girl's voice]
And it would get better,

589
00:48:28,272 --> 00:48:34,576
but now I think my life
has turned sad and that's
the way it is from now on.

590
00:48:34,578 --> 00:48:36,878
I'm jealous of Mom.

591
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:39,981
I want to go be
in heaven with her.

592
00:48:39,983 --> 00:48:43,819
"We would be
happy again...
[sniffling]

593
00:48:43,821 --> 00:48:48,390
"and nobody down here would
ever know I left."

594
00:48:49,892 --> 00:48:53,328
What have you got me
reading this shit for, man?

595
00:49:24,493 --> 00:49:29,164
Pfft! Will you just
stop liking me, man?

596
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:32,934
You're my friend.

597
00:49:36,105 --> 00:49:40,308
No, I ain't no good guy.

598
00:49:41,377 --> 00:49:44,179
But you're a war hero.

599
00:49:49,018 --> 00:49:51,286
I killed a girl, man.

600
00:49:52,455 --> 00:49:54,089
These guys, they were
shooting at us.

601
00:49:54,091 --> 00:49:57,959
They made her stand
in front when I shot back.

602
00:50:00,630 --> 00:50:02,330
Captain, he called it
a "human shield,"

603
00:50:02,332 --> 00:50:04,966
said it wasn't my fault
that I shot her.

604
00:50:06,168 --> 00:50:08,370
Said I had to shoot her.

605
00:50:12,275 --> 00:50:14,242
But-- [sniffing]

606
00:50:15,144 --> 00:50:17,412
But I chose to do it.

607
00:50:19,515 --> 00:50:22,150
[crying]

608
00:50:23,052 --> 00:50:25,120
I-- I was just looking
down the barrel, man.

609
00:50:25,122 --> 00:50:29,624
Just wanted to make
them motherfuckers stop
shooting back at me.

610
00:50:31,127 --> 00:50:33,094
And I saw her.

611
00:50:34,497 --> 00:50:38,400
I saw her. She was like--
she was scared...

612
00:50:39,268 --> 00:50:41,469
and I still shot her.

613
00:50:41,471 --> 00:50:44,406
I saw smoke went up
her chest.

614
00:50:47,443 --> 00:50:52,681
I just-- I couldn't believe
they'd fucking do that
to somebody.

615
00:50:56,252 --> 00:50:57,986
They didn't fucking care.

616
00:50:57,988 --> 00:51:02,691
They got so many people,
they can just-- they just
throw one away.

617
00:51:06,429 --> 00:51:09,297
You're liking me now,
motherfucker?

618
00:51:11,534 --> 00:51:13,034
Yeah.

619
00:51:13,669 --> 00:51:15,437
[sniffling]
Oh, God!

620
00:51:15,439 --> 00:51:17,739
You had to do it...

621
00:51:18,474 --> 00:51:21,176
so you could be here...

622
00:51:22,578 --> 00:51:24,646
and you could be my friend.

623
00:51:24,648 --> 00:51:26,047
Oh god.

624
00:51:26,049 --> 00:51:29,284
I-- I gotta go, man.
I gotta go.

625
00:51:51,374 --> 00:51:55,043
[man] Check out my limousine.
Give me a ride, man.

626
00:51:55,045 --> 00:51:57,012
Yo, Willie-bear.

627
00:51:57,014 --> 00:51:58,747
What up, cardboard boxer?

628
00:51:58,749 --> 00:52:03,385
Brought me some fries.
You're down for another
fight tonight?

629
00:52:06,622 --> 00:52:10,058
Yeah. Sure.

630
00:52:10,060 --> 00:52:13,028
Uh, can you find someone?

631
00:52:14,096 --> 00:52:15,697
I can do that.

632
00:52:17,366 --> 00:52:19,134
Come on.

633
00:52:21,203 --> 00:52:24,372
Hey. Nah, you're a girl.

634
00:52:25,474 --> 00:52:29,477
-Jazz, do you wanna fight?
-Nah, not me.

635
00:52:29,479 --> 00:52:32,247
Tell 'em it's 50 bucks.

636
00:52:33,649 --> 00:52:37,585
Hey, man.
You wanna fight for $50?

637
00:52:37,587 --> 00:52:39,287
Fight you?

638
00:52:39,289 --> 00:52:41,556
[Willie] Yeah.

639
00:52:43,726 --> 00:52:46,127
-Sure.
-Come on.

640
00:52:50,566 --> 00:52:53,101
Hey, this guy will do it.

641
00:52:54,136 --> 00:52:55,770
You got 50 bucks?

642
00:52:55,772 --> 00:52:57,505
Yeah. You down to fight?

643
00:52:57,507 --> 00:52:59,441
Where's the money?

644
00:52:59,842 --> 00:53:02,477
Cash is right here, buddy.

645
00:53:03,212 --> 00:53:04,145
How many rounds?

646
00:53:04,147 --> 00:53:05,447
Just 'til one of you
says "uncle."

647
00:53:05,449 --> 00:53:09,217
Yeah, when he say "uncle,"
how do I know you're not
gonna just drive away?

648
00:53:09,219 --> 00:53:13,755
No, no, no.
They'll pay you.
They're my friends.

649
00:53:16,225 --> 00:53:18,226
Place your bets, gentlemen.

650
00:53:18,228 --> 00:53:20,261
Whoo! All right, all right!

651
00:53:20,263 --> 00:53:22,564
Oh, I like it.
Nice, nice.

652
00:53:22,566 --> 00:53:23,665
Okay. What have we
got here, Evan?

653
00:53:23,667 --> 00:53:28,770
-Hey, buddy, good to see you.
-Whoo! Okay, let's get
this started.

654
00:53:33,776 --> 00:53:35,577
Ready and fight!

655
00:53:35,579 --> 00:53:39,581
-[grunting]
-[JJ] Yeah! That's it.

656
00:53:40,449 --> 00:53:41,516
Good.

657
00:53:41,518 --> 00:53:47,489
-[crowd exclaiming]
-[JJ] Yes! Nice, nice,
nice. Get up.

658
00:53:53,829 --> 00:53:55,530
[groaning]

659
00:53:55,532 --> 00:53:57,532
[screaming]

660
00:53:57,534 --> 00:53:59,400
Fuck!

661
00:54:03,472 --> 00:54:05,707
Yeah! Nice.

662
00:54:05,709 --> 00:54:07,742
Whoa, whoa.
Pay attention to--

663
00:54:07,744 --> 00:54:11,479
-[people shouting]
-Get him! I got 200 on your ass!

664
00:54:14,583 --> 00:54:17,218
[JJ] Come on, Willie.

665
00:54:19,388 --> 00:54:20,588
[JJ laughing]

666
00:54:20,590 --> 00:54:23,825
Yeah, that's my boy, Willie!

667
00:54:23,827 --> 00:54:25,927
That's my money!

668
00:54:26,529 --> 00:54:31,332
-Give me my money,
motherfucker.
-JJ!

669
00:54:40,843 --> 00:54:43,178
JJ, let's go!

670
00:54:43,946 --> 00:54:45,446
JJ, come on.

671
00:54:45,448 --> 00:54:47,749
Fuck! Come on,
let's go, man.

672
00:54:47,751 --> 00:54:51,319
Get in the fucking car,
you piece of shit.

673
00:54:51,321 --> 00:54:53,321
Get in!

674
00:55:02,731 --> 00:55:04,566
[car driving away]

675
00:55:25,754 --> 00:55:28,323
[siren blaring]

676
00:55:30,426 --> 00:55:32,894
[police radio chatter]

677
00:55:40,936 --> 00:55:43,771
[people chattering]

678
00:56:25,981 --> 00:56:28,516
Let's go.
Move it.

679
00:56:29,518 --> 00:56:32,820
Come on, let's go.
Get up.

680
00:56:50,572 --> 00:56:52,040
I need to take a trip,

681
00:56:52,042 --> 00:56:56,611
and you-- you have
to come with me, okay?

682
00:57:00,382 --> 00:57:02,483
Okay.

683
00:57:32,748 --> 00:57:34,115
[sighs]

684
00:57:38,887 --> 00:57:41,089
This is my dad.

685
00:57:44,560 --> 00:57:48,429
He had to watch
me grow up...

686
00:57:48,431 --> 00:57:54,102
from heaven. Just like
your mommy is watching
you grow up from heaven.

687
00:57:57,039 --> 00:58:00,007
I don't know
if he's happy or...

688
00:58:00,776 --> 00:58:03,644
if he's sad watching me.

689
00:58:03,646 --> 00:58:07,915
I didn't grow up so-- so good.

690
00:58:09,752 --> 00:58:12,887
I didn't want him
to have to see...

691
00:58:13,589 --> 00:58:15,757
all of the sad parts.

692
00:58:17,893 --> 00:58:19,627
But you have
to remember...

693
00:58:19,629 --> 00:58:24,832
you don't wanna make your
mom sad in heaven, okay?

694
00:58:24,834 --> 00:58:28,836
You want her to be happy
when she's watching you.

695
00:58:29,772 --> 00:58:32,974
So don't make
her sad, okay?

696
00:58:37,012 --> 00:58:39,147
I miss my dad.

697
00:58:41,450 --> 00:58:43,785
I'll say goodbye to him.

698
00:58:56,799 --> 00:58:59,033
Goodbye, Daddy.

699
00:59:04,006 --> 00:59:06,474
I'll see you soon.

700
00:59:25,661 --> 00:59:29,730
[Willie's voice]
I have seen a lot
of people die.

701
00:59:31,066 --> 00:59:35,536
And one day
I know I will die.

702
00:59:35,538 --> 00:59:38,940
You start to wonder if people
will remember you

703
00:59:38,942 --> 00:59:42,710
as a good person
or a bad person...

704
00:59:42,712 --> 00:59:46,113
or if they'll even
remember you at all.

705
00:59:46,715 --> 00:59:49,650
That's why your mom
was okay when she died,

706
00:59:49,652 --> 00:59:53,221
because she knew
why she was here...

707
00:59:53,223 --> 00:59:55,523
to have you...

708
00:59:55,891 --> 00:59:57,859
and you're a good person.

709
00:59:57,861 --> 01:00:02,129
And you make me
a better person.

710
01:00:03,765 --> 01:00:07,168
And I don't have
anything, but...

711
01:00:07,170 --> 01:00:09,704
if you're getting
these letters...

712
01:00:09,706 --> 01:00:15,176
then maybe, my thing
could be that I helped you.

713
01:00:15,178 --> 01:00:20,715
Maybe I can be
the angel your mom
sent to hug you.

714
01:00:21,950 --> 01:00:24,252
That would be enough for me.

715
01:02:15,797 --> 01:02:17,231
Pinky.

716
01:02:22,304 --> 01:02:24,338
You sleeping?

717
01:02:24,340 --> 01:02:26,807
You sleeping, buddy?

718
01:02:37,819 --> 01:02:40,388
It's pretty cold tonight.

719
01:02:42,424 --> 01:02:46,861
I'm gonna put this
around you. All right?

720
01:03:02,744 --> 01:03:05,179
You have your picture?

721
01:03:06,014 --> 01:03:07,815
Yeah.

722
01:03:08,183 --> 01:03:09,083
Yeah, that's good.

723
01:03:09,085 --> 01:03:12,753
You keep that close
to your heart, all right?

724
01:03:21,763 --> 01:03:25,399
Let me put this
over your head, buddy.

725
01:03:28,270 --> 01:03:30,371
It's so cold.

726
01:03:48,890 --> 01:03:52,193
[crying] You're my
only friend, Pinky.

727
01:04:07,309 --> 01:04:11,011
[wheelchair squeaking]

728
01:04:54,790 --> 01:04:57,925
-[Pope] Who's Willie?
-[speaks indistinctly]

729
01:04:57,927 --> 01:04:59,493
Which one is he?

730
01:05:02,931 --> 01:05:05,366
You know where
Willie's at?

731
01:05:07,269 --> 01:05:10,070
-Yeah, right there.
-Hey, Willie.

732
01:05:11,339 --> 01:05:12,506
Willie!

733
01:05:12,508 --> 01:05:14,308
Get out!

734
01:05:15,377 --> 01:05:16,410
You Willie?

735
01:05:16,412 --> 01:05:21,115
So you the motherfucker
been beating up on all
these people for money?

736
01:05:21,117 --> 01:05:21,982
Huh?

737
01:05:21,984 --> 01:05:26,153
[stuttering]
I'm not the only one.

738
01:05:26,155 --> 01:05:28,122
Wait a minute.

739
01:05:29,891 --> 01:05:32,092
I gave you my blanket.

740
01:05:32,360 --> 01:05:35,396
Where's my fucking
blanket, nigger?

741
01:05:36,298 --> 01:05:38,465
I-- I don't have it.

742
01:05:39,067 --> 01:05:40,868
Yeah, 'course you don't.

743
01:05:40,870 --> 01:05:45,039
The way those kids
have been paying you
to beat up my friends.

744
01:05:46,908 --> 01:05:50,077
You know who I'm talking about!
Them punk motherfuckers.

745
01:05:50,079 --> 01:05:51,045
Who are they?

746
01:05:51,047 --> 01:05:53,948
-They're my friends.
-Your friends?

747
01:05:54,115 --> 01:05:56,917
They're not
your friends, Willie.

748
01:05:56,919 --> 01:05:57,618
Yes, they are.

749
01:05:57,620 --> 01:06:00,020
Are they sleeping
down here with you?

750
01:06:00,022 --> 01:06:03,624
They're not sleeping
in a goddamn box, are they?

751
01:06:04,326 --> 01:06:05,159
They're not your friends.

752
01:06:05,161 --> 01:06:09,196
Are you out of your
fucking mind letting
'em do that shit?

753
01:06:09,497 --> 01:06:11,432
If they bring their ass
on the nickel again,

754
01:06:11,434 --> 01:06:14,501
I'm gonna knock the shit
out of them. You got that?

755
01:06:14,903 --> 01:06:17,504
-No, you won't.
-No, I wont?

756
01:06:18,440 --> 01:06:19,640
Why?

757
01:06:20,942 --> 01:06:22,509
I'll kill you.

758
01:06:23,478 --> 01:06:25,946
You're gonna fucking kill me?

759
01:06:28,016 --> 01:06:29,483
Fuck your ass.

760
01:06:30,218 --> 01:06:35,456
They come here again,
some dead motherfuckers.
You got that?

761
01:06:40,662 --> 01:06:41,462
Where's your friends?

762
01:06:41,464 --> 01:06:45,199
How come you're
always down here
with us all the time?

763
01:06:45,201 --> 01:06:48,302
You don't have any friends.

764
01:06:51,606 --> 01:06:53,607
This is my friend.

765
01:06:55,110 --> 01:06:57,211
Watch your ass.

766
01:07:01,983 --> 01:07:04,251
[grunting]

767
01:07:08,189 --> 01:07:10,624
You don't have any friends!

768
01:07:12,360 --> 01:07:14,428
Nobody knows any of you!

769
01:07:14,930 --> 01:07:17,064
Nobody knows you people!

770
01:07:17,066 --> 01:07:19,166
They know me!

771
01:07:20,535 --> 01:07:22,202
They know me!

772
01:07:24,639 --> 01:07:26,206
They know me.

773
01:07:26,641 --> 01:07:29,376
I'm the cardboard boxer.

774
01:07:34,149 --> 01:07:36,083
What are you looking at?

775
01:07:38,286 --> 01:07:40,054
[grunting]

776
01:07:55,670 --> 01:07:57,438
Stupid.

777
01:07:59,040 --> 01:08:01,041
So stupid.

778
01:08:06,481 --> 01:08:09,083
You're stupid, Willie.

779
01:08:11,286 --> 01:08:13,020
You're stupid.

780
01:08:17,225 --> 01:08:21,161
Just like everyone says.
You're stupid.

781
01:08:30,005 --> 01:08:30,471
[sighing]

782
01:08:30,473 --> 01:08:34,041
I don't think
we should talk anymore.

783
01:08:36,077 --> 01:08:38,412
I'm not a good person.

784
01:08:39,781 --> 01:08:42,182
I hurt people.

785
01:08:42,684 --> 01:08:48,222
And I don't do it by accident.
I-- I do it for money.

786
01:08:49,057 --> 01:08:53,394
I don't think I'll be seeing you
and your mother in heaven.

787
01:08:53,396 --> 01:08:56,730
I think I'm gonna
have to go to hell.

788
01:08:59,234 --> 01:09:01,268
And it scares me.

789
01:09:06,141 --> 01:09:10,144
So, I won't be able
to talk to you anymore.

790
01:09:11,079 --> 01:09:15,049
But I wanted to thank you
for being my friend.

791
01:09:17,819 --> 01:09:22,256
You and Pinky were
the only friends that I had.

792
01:09:23,825 --> 01:09:27,361
I'm gonna go on
and go pretty soon.

793
01:09:27,829 --> 01:09:29,129
Like you said, I, uh--

794
01:09:29,131 --> 01:09:34,668
I don't want
to have a big sad part
of my life anymore.

795
01:09:39,808 --> 01:09:42,543
But I wanted to say goodbye.

796
01:09:46,381 --> 01:09:47,815
Yeah.

797
01:10:15,176 --> 01:10:17,544
[telephone ringing]

798
01:10:17,546 --> 01:10:20,114
[whispering]

799
01:10:21,516 --> 01:10:25,119
-What do you want me
to tell him?
-I got it.

800
01:10:32,427 --> 01:10:33,560
Willie.

801
01:10:33,562 --> 01:10:35,295
I'm Staff Sergeant Thompson.

802
01:10:35,297 --> 01:10:38,132
I really appreciate
your willingness
to serve your country.

803
01:10:38,134 --> 01:10:43,837
Unfortunately, you don't meet
our age requirements
for enlistment.

804
01:10:43,839 --> 01:10:45,339
I'm sorry.

805
01:10:45,341 --> 01:10:46,340
Please.

806
01:10:46,342 --> 01:10:50,410
There's nothing I can do.
It's a firm rule.

807
01:10:50,879 --> 01:10:53,547
Listen, if you need any help,

808
01:10:53,549 --> 01:10:56,850
I can contact
homeless shelters
in the area--

809
01:10:56,852 --> 01:10:59,386
I'll be a human shield.

810
01:11:00,488 --> 01:11:00,921
[whispers] What?

811
01:11:00,923 --> 01:11:05,626
You can use me to protect
the soldiers from bullets.

812
01:11:06,828 --> 01:11:09,396
You can just throw me away.

813
01:11:11,232 --> 01:11:12,799
I want you to.

814
01:11:12,801 --> 01:11:15,802
I want you to throw me away.

815
01:11:47,635 --> 01:11:50,370
All right, all right.
Back up, back up.

816
01:11:50,372 --> 01:11:52,506
Make some room. Come on.

817
01:11:52,508 --> 01:11:53,373
Ah!

818
01:11:53,375 --> 01:11:55,909
Welcome, ladies
and gentlemen.

819
01:11:55,911 --> 01:11:57,277
I'm JJ,

820
01:11:57,279 --> 01:11:59,346
your doorman
to the poor man.

821
01:11:59,348 --> 01:12:00,781
Now, tonight,

822
01:12:00,783 --> 01:12:01,381
as promised,

823
01:12:01,383 --> 01:12:05,219
you're going to see
something you can't
see anywhere else.

824
01:12:05,221 --> 01:12:07,955
Two men fighting
for their lives.

825
01:12:07,957 --> 01:12:12,859
No time limits,
no judges' decisions,
just real.

826
01:12:13,795 --> 01:12:15,395
So, starting tonight

827
01:12:15,397 --> 01:12:16,830
and every night
you come down here,

828
01:12:16,832 --> 01:12:21,435
you're no longer
business majors
or fucking trust fund babies.

829
01:12:21,437 --> 01:12:22,336
No, no, no, no.

830
01:12:22,338 --> 01:12:26,406
From now on,
you are Romans,

831
01:12:26,408 --> 01:12:28,575
and these bums...

832
01:12:29,844 --> 01:12:31,845
your gladiators.

833
01:12:32,947 --> 01:12:33,447
So...

834
01:12:33,449 --> 01:12:37,551
let's get this show started.
Who's up? Willie!

835
01:12:37,553 --> 01:12:39,519
You out here?

836
01:12:41,589 --> 01:12:43,023
Come on, Willie.

837
01:12:45,460 --> 01:12:48,695
[chuckles nervously]
All right, no Willie.

838
01:12:48,697 --> 01:12:52,799
Uh-- Who else?
Who else? Somebody else?
A 100 bucks. Come on.

839
01:12:52,801 --> 01:12:57,971
What you all had
a long day at work?
Come on! Hundred fucking bucks.

840
01:12:57,973 --> 01:12:59,506
Someone?

841
01:13:02,443 --> 01:13:04,011
For fuck's sake.
Come on!

842
01:13:04,013 --> 01:13:08,815
Someone doesn't step up,
me and your money
are leaving. For real.

843
01:13:09,584 --> 01:13:10,784
I'll do it.

844
01:13:10,786 --> 01:13:14,321
All right.
Somebody still got
some balls to speak up.

845
01:13:14,323 --> 01:13:15,455
[whispers]
Methuselah,
come on, man.

846
01:13:15,457 --> 01:13:18,925
-You don't need
to do this, brother.
-[JJ] All right.

847
01:13:19,661 --> 01:13:22,329
I'm hungry, man.

848
01:13:23,364 --> 01:13:24,698
What about the rest of you?

849
01:13:24,700 --> 01:13:26,533
-Pope said, "No more fighting."
-Oh, the Pope?

850
01:13:26,535 --> 01:13:30,304
-[Jazz] Yeah.
-"The Pope" said,
"No more fighting"?

851
01:13:30,306 --> 01:13:31,038
That's right.

852
01:13:31,040 --> 01:13:33,840
Well, yeah.
The Pope's...

853
01:13:33,842 --> 01:13:37,978
not putting food in your belly
tomorrow morning, is he?

854
01:13:37,980 --> 01:13:40,714
No. I am.

855
01:13:41,015 --> 01:13:43,750
The only salvation
out here, boys, is me.

856
01:13:43,752 --> 01:13:46,086
-[man] Just get going.
-[man 2] Come on, go.

857
01:13:46,088 --> 01:13:48,422
Willie!

858
01:13:48,690 --> 01:13:52,359
I know you're
out here, Willie-bear.

859
01:13:52,361 --> 01:13:54,761
Come on.
Show yourself.

860
01:14:03,971 --> 01:14:06,940
What are you doing, man?
Come on. Get in here.

861
01:14:06,942 --> 01:14:08,842
Not tonight, JJ.

862
01:14:08,844 --> 01:14:09,543
"Not tonight, JJ"?

863
01:14:09,545 --> 01:14:11,044
What are you--
what are you, my girlfriend?

864
01:14:11,046 --> 01:14:12,813
Come on,
cardboard boxer.
Get in here.

865
01:14:12,815 --> 01:14:14,548
This is your thing now.

866
01:14:14,550 --> 01:14:17,584
[indistinct chattering]

867
01:14:17,852 --> 01:14:21,621
I need you, man.
I brought all these--
these are important people.

868
01:14:21,623 --> 01:14:22,889
I brought them all here for you.

869
01:14:22,891 --> 01:14:24,791
Can you fucking be my friend?

870
01:14:24,793 --> 01:14:26,360
[man] Come on!

871
01:14:26,362 --> 01:14:28,095
[whispers]
What the hell?

872
01:14:28,429 --> 01:14:30,664
Look at that.
Look at that old man.

873
01:14:31,432 --> 01:14:32,866
Go ahead.
Look at him.

874
01:14:32,868 --> 01:14:33,934
Look at that
old man, right now.

875
01:14:33,936 --> 01:14:37,437
You want someone
else to throwing those
punches at him? Hmm?

876
01:14:37,439 --> 01:14:40,006
Or you wanna throw 'em?

877
01:14:48,449 --> 01:14:53,120
All right! Whoo!
All right, we are on!

878
01:14:53,122 --> 01:14:53,620
Folks!

879
01:14:53,622 --> 01:14:54,788
For the first fight
let's go with, uh,

880
01:14:54,790 --> 01:14:58,392
four to one odds
on Methuselah to go
the distance. Yeah?

881
01:14:58,394 --> 01:14:59,960
All right, thank you.
Sounds good.

882
01:14:59,962 --> 01:15:03,397
-Take that.
All of it. All of it.
-Thank you, sir. Thank you.

883
01:15:03,399 --> 01:15:05,699
You don't have to do this.

884
01:15:07,502 --> 01:15:09,403
I'm sorry, Willie.

885
01:15:09,604 --> 01:15:12,806
Now, the bets
are officially closed.

886
01:15:12,808 --> 01:15:19,012
In this corner, the oldest
man alive coming direct
to you from Skid Row...

887
01:15:19,014 --> 01:15:19,980
Methuselah!

888
01:15:19,982 --> 01:15:21,782
-[crowd cheering]
-And in the other corner,

889
01:15:21,784 --> 01:15:26,686
undefeated reigning champion
of all time, my good friend,

890
01:15:26,688 --> 01:15:30,824
Willie, the cardboard boxer.

891
01:15:30,826 --> 01:15:33,827
-[crowd cheering]
-Whoo! Okay.

892
01:15:33,829 --> 01:15:37,931
Three, two, one, fight!

893
01:15:37,933 --> 01:15:39,766
Woo-hoo!

894
01:15:40,001 --> 01:15:42,702
-Yo, man.
-What's going on?

895
01:15:42,704 --> 01:15:43,837
Come on! Go!

896
01:15:43,839 --> 01:15:47,107
Come on.
Get in there.
Go, go, go.

897
01:15:51,179 --> 01:15:52,712
That's it.

898
01:15:52,714 --> 01:15:53,613
Hit him!

899
01:15:53,615 --> 01:15:55,482
Come on.
What are you doing?

900
01:15:55,484 --> 01:15:57,017
Fight, come on!

901
01:15:57,019 --> 01:15:58,618
Hit him, come on!

902
01:15:58,620 --> 01:16:00,220
Oh! Oh!

903
01:16:00,222 --> 01:16:04,858
Oh, no, no! Get up, get up!
Whoa! What the fuck is this?

904
01:16:04,860 --> 01:16:06,693
Hit me, hit me.

905
01:16:07,895 --> 01:16:09,496
-[man] Get up!
-[Willie] Hit me.

906
01:16:09,498 --> 01:16:12,065
[JJ] Hit him! Wait. Stop.

907
01:16:12,067 --> 01:16:12,699
What the fuck?

908
01:16:12,701 --> 01:16:15,802
-No stopping. It's on.
-No, no, no. This isn't
how it usually is.

909
01:16:15,804 --> 01:16:17,704
Willie, get the fuck up now!

910
01:16:17,706 --> 01:16:19,206
-What is this?
A fucking fix?
-Hit me.

911
01:16:19,208 --> 01:16:21,741
Willie, you do not
get to throw this,
man. Get up!

912
01:16:21,743 --> 01:16:25,212
-Upside! Upside!
-This is fucking bullshit.
This is fixed.

913
01:16:25,214 --> 01:16:28,615
This little motherfucker
is trying to rip us off.

914
01:16:28,617 --> 01:16:31,251
Hey, Willie.
What do we got here?

915
01:16:31,953 --> 01:16:33,854
-Huh?
-Wait.

916
01:16:33,856 --> 01:16:35,589
Hey, hey, stop!

917
01:16:35,756 --> 01:16:37,891
Don't make me do this.
Fucking hit him.

918
01:16:37,893 --> 01:16:40,060
-Don't, JJ! JJ!
-[JJ] Hit him.

919
01:16:40,062 --> 01:16:42,262
-Fucking hit him!
-Don't burn her!

920
01:16:42,264 --> 01:16:43,029
JJ, give him the book.

921
01:16:43,031 --> 01:16:47,767
Don't make me
tell you again, Willie.
Fucking hit him.

922
01:16:55,076 --> 01:16:57,644
I'm not gonna hit him.

923
01:16:57,646 --> 01:16:58,945
Fine.

924
01:16:59,780 --> 01:17:00,947
No!

925
01:17:06,854 --> 01:17:08,221
[grunting and screaming]

926
01:17:08,223 --> 01:17:10,624

[groaning]

928
01:17:13,996 --> 01:17:15,896
[sirens blaring]

929
01:17:17,532 --> 01:17:21,101
JJ, come on.
JJ, come on!

930
01:17:23,137 --> 01:17:24,871
[groaning]

931
01:17:29,844 --> 01:17:33,146
[heart monitor beeping]

932
01:17:39,954 --> 01:17:41,154
[nurse] Sir...

933
01:17:41,156 --> 01:17:43,690
I'm going to leave
this monitor on.

934
01:17:43,692 --> 01:17:46,092
Just speak up
if you need anything.

935
01:17:46,094 --> 01:17:47,561
Okay?

936
01:17:56,237 --> 01:18:00,006
[woman speaking over intercom]

937
01:18:23,831 --> 01:18:27,801
My mommy
gave me this diary...

938
01:18:28,035 --> 01:18:32,839
[over intercom]
the Christmas before
she went to heaven.

939
01:18:34,208 --> 01:18:38,111
She told me
to write in it every day...

940
01:18:39,313 --> 01:18:41,781
because every day...

941
01:18:43,117 --> 01:18:46,186
that we're alive is special.

942
01:18:49,657 --> 01:18:52,993
When someone
loves you that much...

943
01:18:54,061 --> 01:18:56,896
you're special "automcly."

944
01:19:02,303 --> 01:19:05,639
So, when I get to heaven...

945
01:19:08,075 --> 01:19:10,110
I can tell her...

946
01:19:10,778 --> 01:19:15,048
about every day
that I was alive...

947
01:19:15,783 --> 01:19:18,785
and I won't
forget anything.

948
01:19:20,388 --> 01:19:21,187
I'll...

949
01:19:21,189 --> 01:19:25,959
tell her about
the days I was bad...

950
01:19:27,194 --> 01:19:30,764
and I'll tell her
about the days...

951
01:19:32,767 --> 01:19:35,702
that I didn't do
anything at all.

952
01:19:46,714 --> 01:19:49,783
Now, I'm going to sleep.

953
01:20:11,806 --> 01:20:13,339
Yo, you missed a turn.

954
01:20:13,341 --> 01:20:16,843
I didn't miss
the fucking turn.

955
01:20:16,845 --> 01:20:18,445
You're drunk.

956
01:20:18,447 --> 01:20:19,979
[brakes screeching]

957
01:20:19,981 --> 01:20:21,948
Whoa! Look out!

958
01:20:28,222 --> 01:20:30,256
Hey, you got a problem?

959
01:20:30,791 --> 01:20:32,959
Yeah, I got two problems...

960
01:20:32,961 --> 01:20:35,228
but you boys got three.

961
01:20:35,230 --> 01:20:37,464
[brakes screeching]

962
01:20:42,203 --> 01:20:44,070
-Fuck.
-Oh, shit, shit.

963
01:20:44,072 --> 01:20:45,105
Get out of the car.

964
01:20:45,107 --> 01:20:47,006
Don't get out of the car.

965
01:20:51,345 --> 01:20:55,482
[sighing] Okay.
Okay. He just wants
the car, okay?

966
01:20:55,484 --> 01:20:58,952
-Fuck.
-I said, "Get out the car."

967
01:20:58,954 --> 01:21:01,154
Okay, you can
give him the car.

968
01:21:08,329 --> 01:21:09,829
Hey, man.

969
01:21:10,931 --> 01:21:14,768
You just take
the car, okay?
I-- I got--

970
01:21:14,770 --> 01:21:16,469
I got 300 bucks right here.

971
01:21:16,471 --> 01:21:17,904
We cool.
We cool, man.

972
01:21:17,906 --> 01:21:20,774
I don't want
your money or your car.

973
01:21:20,776 --> 01:21:24,277
I want you two boys
to fight each other.

974
01:21:24,411 --> 01:21:28,047
The winner
gets to drive home,
but the loser...

975
01:21:28,482 --> 01:21:30,416
they stay with me.

976
01:21:31,252 --> 01:21:34,354
Just take the car, man.
Just take the car.

977
01:21:34,989 --> 01:21:36,389
You got 10 seconds.

978
01:21:36,391 --> 01:21:37,857

give him the keys.

979
01:21:37,859 --> 01:21:40,527
-[Pope] Six seconds.
-Give him the fucking keys, man!

980
01:21:40,529 --> 01:21:44,297
-Four seconds.
-Ty, give him
the fucking keys, man!

981
01:21:44,299 --> 01:21:44,964

What's your name?

01:23:20,928 --> 01:23:23,329
That's okay.
Can I talk to you
for a second?

995
01:23:23,331 --> 01:23:25,498
I just have one
question for you.

996
01:23:25,500 --> 01:23:31,604
If you died today,
do you know 100% that
you would go to heaven?

997
01:23:32,172 --> 01:23:33,406
Because there is actually
only one way

998
01:23:33,408 --> 01:23:36,142
where you can be sure
100% that you'll go to heaven.

999
01:23:36,144 --> 01:23:40,046
-Did you know that?
-I don't wanna go to heaven.

1000
01:23:43,684 --> 01:23:46,219
