1
00:00:14,279 --> 00:00:17,016
April 22nd, 3:00 AM.

2
00:00:18,451 --> 00:00:19,452
The ward doesn't have her.

3
00:00:20,185 --> 00:00:21,187
I do.

4
00:00:23,388 --> 00:00:25,759
By the time they've
figured out, we'll be gone.

5
00:00:32,731 --> 00:00:33,765
The
ward doesn't have her.

6
00:00:33,798 --> 00:00:34,801
I do.

7
00:00:37,136 --> 00:00:39,239
By the time they've figured
it out, we'll be gone.

8
00:01:01,726 --> 00:01:03,762
The patient has reached
non-rapid eye movement sleep

9
00:01:05,763 --> 00:01:11,736
and is expressing a period of
emotional realism triggered

10
00:01:11,769 --> 00:01:14,573
by an extreme psychologically
important event.

11
00:02:06,724 --> 00:02:12,198
Darcy, stay where you
are in your dream.

12
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:13,233
What do you see?

13
00:02:14,466 --> 00:02:15,468
What do you hear?

14
00:02:17,669 --> 00:02:19,337
Nobody is going to hurt you.

15
00:02:19,371 --> 00:02:21,841
But you have to let me in.

16
00:02:21,873 --> 00:02:23,209
First
you're chosen.

17
00:02:23,241 --> 00:02:24,242
Then you're used.

18
00:02:24,276 --> 00:02:25,278
First you're chosen.

19
00:02:25,311 --> 00:02:25,944
Then you're used.

20
00:02:25,978 --> 00:02:27,180
First you're chosen.

21
00:02:27,212 --> 00:02:28,180
Then you're used.

22
00:02:28,213 --> 00:02:29,181
First you're chosen.

23
00:02:29,215 --> 00:02:30,216
Then you're used.

24
00:02:30,248 --> 00:02:32,685
What are you saying?

25
00:02:32,717 --> 00:02:34,286
First
you're chosen.

26
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:35,453
What is it?

27
00:02:35,486 --> 00:02:36,621
First
you're chosen.

28
00:02:36,655 --> 00:02:37,689
Then you're used.

29
00:02:39,258 --> 00:02:40,225
What do you see?

30
00:02:46,331 --> 00:02:47,332
Darcy?

31
00:02:59,245 --> 00:03:00,346
Stand up.

32
00:03:01,413 --> 00:03:02,415
Just sit there.

33
00:03:07,986 --> 00:03:09,188
It's OK.

34
00:03:15,627 --> 00:03:16,762
That's going to be sore.

35
00:03:18,963 --> 00:03:19,966
I'll take care.

36
00:03:23,701 --> 00:03:25,371
Put your hands over here.

37
00:03:25,403 --> 00:03:28,274
Lean your head
against the mirror.

38
00:03:28,306 --> 00:03:30,575
You probably see that one hand
tied to the bed will be enough.

39
00:03:30,609 --> 00:03:31,844
It didn't work, did it?

40
00:03:43,455 --> 00:03:46,326
I can't help you if you
don't try to remember.

41
00:03:49,328 --> 00:03:50,763
I'm scared.

42
00:03:52,298 --> 00:03:53,299
Scared of what?

43
00:03:55,533 --> 00:03:56,935
Of what I might become.

44
00:03:58,537 --> 00:04:01,706
It's clear in
documented evidence

45
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:03,643
that these children sleep
walk because they are trying

46
00:04:03,675 --> 00:04:05,543
to get back to their abuser.

47
00:04:05,576 --> 00:04:07,513
You want to confront her.

48
00:04:07,545 --> 00:04:09,581
You have to go where she is.

49
00:04:09,615 --> 00:04:11,484
She's dead.

50
00:04:11,516 --> 00:04:15,388
The breakthrough we
need lies in those walls,

51
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:18,391
not these, not serenity.

52
00:04:18,423 --> 00:04:22,495
What she did to me in that
house... going back there.

53
00:04:24,495 --> 00:04:26,399
And you really
think it will work?

54
00:04:32,538 --> 00:04:33,439
It has to work.

55
00:04:36,809 --> 00:04:39,345
If I see you regressing,
I'll get you out of there.

56
00:04:41,413 --> 00:04:44,417
And I promise I'll
torch the place myself.

57
00:04:49,687 --> 00:04:51,324
Let's get some sleep.

58
00:05:38,137 --> 00:05:40,506
After a continuous night time
somnambulism therapy,

59
00:05:42,574 --> 00:05:46,778
the patient has shown no signs
of the ability or desire

60
00:05:46,812 --> 00:05:50,449
to express suppressed physical
and emotional memories...

61
00:05:52,151 --> 00:05:55,721
continual self-abuse and
injury occur nightly.

62
00:05:55,754 --> 00:05:57,556
Scheduled awakenings
have been applied

63
00:05:57,588 --> 00:05:59,391
and the results are nil.

64
00:05:59,425 --> 00:06:02,461
Three days ago, I was
notified by the county

65
00:06:02,494 --> 00:06:06,799
that the patient's family
homestead is abandoned and left

66
00:06:06,831 --> 00:06:10,870
to her by default as the
only living family member.

67
00:06:10,903 --> 00:06:12,872
In spite of the
patients unwillingness

68
00:06:12,904 --> 00:06:17,008
to accept recommended therapy,
the next course of action

69
00:06:17,041 --> 00:06:19,477
is complete submersion in the
environment where.

70
00:06:22,281 --> 00:06:25,991
<b>CUT HER OUT</b>

71
00:06:27,112 --> 00:06:30,112
<b>Subrip: Pix</b>

72
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:18,871
You'll be fine.

73
00:07:20,771 --> 00:07:21,873
I'm going to take a look.

74
00:10:13,778 --> 00:10:14,879
What?

75
00:10:16,347 --> 00:10:17,682
What is it?

76
00:10:21,219 --> 00:10:22,221
Darcy?

77
00:11:31,456 --> 00:11:32,425
Look, it's chips.

78
00:12:03,855 --> 00:12:04,856
Do you know me?

79
00:12:36,187 --> 00:12:37,322
You can pass me that bowl.

80
00:12:47,465 --> 00:12:48,533
It's OK.

81
00:12:50,067 --> 00:12:51,069
You can eat.

82
00:12:51,937 --> 00:12:52,937
That's OK.

83
00:12:58,876 --> 00:13:02,213
He can't... can't eat until
he's been given permission.

84
00:13:02,246 --> 00:13:04,415
If you ate before she said
it, you'd get the whip.

85
00:13:06,183 --> 00:13:11,557
Say that the she did...
put yourself in her skin.

86
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:14,393
She's standing over him
placing food in his bowl.

87
00:13:14,426 --> 00:13:16,261
Before she leaves,
what does she say?

88
00:13:16,293 --> 00:13:18,129
Don't make me say it.

89
00:13:18,163 --> 00:13:19,932
I'm going to be sick.

90
00:13:19,965 --> 00:13:20,899
Do you know the words?

91
00:13:20,932 --> 00:13:22,334
Yes.

92
00:13:22,366 --> 00:13:23,368
Then say them.

93
00:13:26,538 --> 00:13:30,842
You... you are
hungry for beast.

94
00:13:33,043 --> 00:13:35,814
But in my loving mercy, I
have left you this feast.

95
00:13:58,202 --> 00:13:59,204
Come on in.

96
00:14:00,572 --> 00:14:01,841
You're not ghost.

97
00:14:06,945 --> 00:14:07,947
We're not going to hurt you.

98
00:14:11,048 --> 00:14:11,917
Can you tell me your name?

99
00:14:47,952 --> 00:14:48,953
Sam?

100
00:14:50,388 --> 00:14:51,257
It's nice to meet you, Sam.

101
00:14:52,557 --> 00:14:53,558
I'll leave the
door open for you.

102
00:15:00,197 --> 00:15:01,332
We've arrived.

103
00:15:01,365 --> 00:15:03,100
It's worse than I thought.

104
00:15:03,134 --> 00:15:07,538
We found a feral child
named Sam living here

105
00:15:07,572 --> 00:15:10,107
in deplorable conditions.

106
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:13,978
He appears malnourished,
but otherwise healthy.

107
00:15:14,011 --> 00:15:16,714
His only communication has
been roaring and growling,

108
00:15:16,748 --> 00:15:21,286
but has cognitive abilities
that is expressed by hearing

109
00:15:21,318 --> 00:15:23,120
and following a command.

110
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:44,442
His name is Sam.

111
00:15:46,577 --> 00:15:48,512
Is he your brother, Darcy?

112
00:15:48,546 --> 00:15:49,480
Are there others?

113
00:15:52,116 --> 00:15:54,019
How could I tell you about
things that I don't remember.

114
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:59,691
I have no idea about
him or anything else

115
00:15:59,724 --> 00:16:01,126
we might find here.

116
00:16:02,494 --> 00:16:03,729
He's just sitting in that
room.

117
00:16:05,462 --> 00:16:06,397
What is that room?

118
00:16:07,698 --> 00:16:09,434
I'm not going back in there.

119
00:16:11,635 --> 00:16:13,171
I can't face this.

120
00:16:15,139 --> 00:16:16,140
You can't pretend that
room doesn't exist.

121
00:16:18,176 --> 00:16:21,580
Maybe that's the starting
point for your healing.

122
00:16:21,613 --> 00:16:24,683
Maybe that's the place
where your pain lives.

123
00:16:24,716 --> 00:16:28,387
But right now you need to
show that little boy that you

124
00:16:28,419 --> 00:16:31,522
understand the place he's in.

125
00:16:31,556 --> 00:16:32,824
I'll try to get
him to come out.

126
00:16:35,326 --> 00:16:39,264
But if I do, then you have to
promise me you'll board it up.

127
00:16:41,298 --> 00:16:42,134
Of course.

128
00:17:23,173 --> 00:17:24,343
I lived in here too.

129
00:17:27,311 --> 00:17:29,714
I know what happens
in this room.

130
00:17:31,648 --> 00:17:33,117
It's wrong that you're in
here.

131
00:17:34,486 --> 00:17:37,522
And it's wrong what
she did to you.

132
00:17:37,555 --> 00:17:40,158
You think you're an animal.

133
00:17:40,191 --> 00:17:41,393
But you're not.

134
00:17:44,729 --> 00:17:51,236
I need you to come out with
me and let me guide you

135
00:17:51,269 --> 00:17:57,275
to some place new...
a place where no one

136
00:17:57,307 --> 00:17:59,711
whips you or starves you.

137
00:18:01,445 --> 00:18:04,348
When you get ready, I'm
going to be right outside.

138
00:18:06,550 --> 00:18:07,785
And I'm going to be
waiting for you.

139
00:18:07,818 --> 00:18:08,820
OK?

140
00:19:22,393 --> 00:19:23,260
Dr. Andrews.

141
00:19:23,294 --> 00:19:24,461
You fucking idiot.

142
00:19:24,494 --> 00:19:25,863
Excuse me?

143
00:19:25,896 --> 00:19:27,464
Don't play dumb.

144
00:19:27,498 --> 00:19:28,432
Bring her back.

145
00:19:28,465 --> 00:19:30,568
And I mean right now.

146
00:19:30,602 --> 00:19:34,206
If you do, maybe
you keep your job.

147
00:19:34,239 --> 00:19:35,440
I don't know what
you're talking about.

148
00:19:35,472 --> 00:19:36,441
I'm on leave.

149
00:19:36,473 --> 00:19:37,641
() Then
why are you on leave?

150
00:19:37,674 --> 00:19:38,542
You want to talk about that?

151
00:19:38,576 --> 00:19:39,777
It wasn't my fault.

152
00:19:39,810 --> 00:19:42,279
() You can't
save the world, Dr. Andrews.

153
00:19:42,313 --> 00:19:44,282
They are crazy.

154
00:19:44,315 --> 00:19:46,618
You're putting yourself and
this institution in danger

155
00:19:46,651 --> 00:19:48,420
just because your kid died.

156
00:19:48,452 --> 00:19:50,754
Tell me this... how
do we expect people

157
00:19:50,788 --> 00:19:52,656
to get better when
all we do is drug them

158
00:19:52,690 --> 00:19:54,659
and lock them in a cell?

159
00:19:54,692 --> 00:19:56,228
() Last week
you took a violent sociopath

160
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:57,761
to the ward without
permission.

161
00:19:57,795 --> 00:19:59,998
And he nearly killed someone.

162
00:20:00,030 --> 00:20:02,634
The world is not your
personal asylum, Ryan.

163
00:20:02,666 --> 00:20:06,003
Now, I am asking you as your
colleague... bring her back.

164
00:20:06,037 --> 00:20:08,240
Like I said, I don't know
what you're talking about.

165
00:20:08,272 --> 00:20:09,273
I'm on leave.

166
00:21:05,462 --> 00:21:06,464
Don't smoke.

167
00:21:07,597 --> 00:21:08,733
Mother wouldn't like that.

168
00:21:11,536 --> 00:21:12,770
She's dead.

169
00:21:14,338 --> 00:21:15,874
You can do anything you like.

170
00:21:18,009 --> 00:21:20,545
Like get well... something else
your mother wouldn't like.

171
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:24,883
Sam's not ready.

172
00:21:24,915 --> 00:21:26,817
He doesn't trust us.

173
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:32,824
She was manipulative like
that... would give a command

174
00:21:32,856 --> 00:21:35,093
and then beat you
when you obey.

175
00:21:35,125 --> 00:21:36,295
Let him stay.

176
00:21:38,363 --> 00:21:39,564
The last thing we should do
is force anything on him.

177
00:21:40,932 --> 00:21:41,799
We sit back.

178
00:21:44,469 --> 00:21:45,403
And we let him figure
out how to respond to us.

179
00:21:45,435 --> 00:21:46,169
No.

180
00:21:47,672 --> 00:21:49,874
No, we have to get
him out of here.

181
00:21:49,906 --> 00:21:50,875
We have to tell
the authorities.

182
00:21:52,509 --> 00:21:56,780
The only way this works
is if you get well.

183
00:21:56,814 --> 00:21:58,950
Remember, we talked about
this.

184
00:21:58,982 --> 00:22:03,321
Otherwise, they take
you... they drug you up.

185
00:22:05,522 --> 00:22:08,425
They throw you back
in the water.

186
00:22:08,459 --> 00:22:12,764
I can't look at him.

187
00:22:12,797 --> 00:22:16,867
I've spent years trying to
kill that part of myself.

188
00:22:19,871 --> 00:22:22,507
And now it sits
right in front of me.

189
00:22:24,608 --> 00:22:28,812
Every breath reminding
me it will never die.

190
00:22:28,846 --> 00:22:33,518
You're a kid just like Sam.

191
00:22:33,550 --> 00:22:34,385
But he doesn't have
to fight alone.

192
00:22:34,419 --> 00:22:35,787
He has us.

193
00:22:38,021 --> 00:22:42,860
You save Sam, you save
yourself, essentially.

194
00:22:42,894 --> 00:22:46,463
But I need you
in there with me.

195
00:22:46,497 --> 00:22:49,534
I can't... I won't be able to
sleep without you.

196
00:22:54,538 --> 00:22:55,539
Of course.

197
00:23:09,554 --> 00:23:10,555
Go to sleep.

198
00:25:01,265 --> 00:25:08,240
Five hours
of non-compliance.

199
00:25:10,674 --> 00:25:14,546
The subject has emerged
from the pen.

200
00:25:14,578 --> 00:25:16,714
The source of his
security is unknown.

201
00:25:25,323 --> 00:25:26,525
Don't wake him.

202
00:25:32,762 --> 00:25:33,764
This is going to work.

203
00:25:35,266 --> 00:25:37,669
Today we start.

204
00:25:37,701 --> 00:25:42,173
We start in the house...
get some more rest.

205
00:27:43,493 --> 00:27:44,695
You awake?

206
00:27:47,097 --> 00:27:47,865
Kind of.

207
00:27:50,334 --> 00:27:55,339
Two things I'm
thankful for... Sam.

208
00:27:55,372 --> 00:27:57,442
What's the second?

209
00:27:57,474 --> 00:27:58,942
You trusting me
not to sleepwalk.

210
00:28:01,511 --> 00:28:04,749
Like I said before,
I'm glad you're just

211
00:28:04,781 --> 00:28:06,750
trying to get back home.

212
00:28:08,853 --> 00:28:10,087
You're here now.

213
00:28:10,121 --> 00:28:11,122
You don't need them.

214
00:28:43,788 --> 00:28:47,791
Once upon a time,
there was a master

215
00:28:47,825 --> 00:28:51,796
who had a horse who had been a
faithful and loyal servant.

216
00:28:53,230 --> 00:28:56,534
But soon the beast
turned on his master

217
00:28:56,567 --> 00:29:00,739
and he became
disobedient and weak.

218
00:29:33,237 --> 00:29:35,439
He's still not talking.

219
00:29:35,471 --> 00:29:37,508
But he brought me some
paper and his black crayon

220
00:29:37,540 --> 00:29:39,943
and just sat down
and started drawing.

221
00:29:39,977 --> 00:29:41,412
That's good.

222
00:29:41,444 --> 00:29:42,813
How are you?

223
00:29:44,214 --> 00:29:45,282
I am not looking back.

224
00:29:46,616 --> 00:29:48,819
It's about today.
Am good.

225
00:29:52,388 --> 00:29:53,791
It's because of you
he's getting better.

226
00:30:12,509 --> 00:30:13,577
Is black your
favorite color too?

227
00:30:16,046 --> 00:30:17,849
How am I going to color
with you if there is just

228
00:30:17,882 --> 00:30:18,817
one black crayon?

229
00:30:25,088 --> 00:30:25,956
Problem solved.

230
00:30:29,894 --> 00:30:30,961
Yeah?

231
00:30:41,070 --> 00:30:45,843
We're getting my start from the
tree house of all tree houses.

232
00:31:15,172 --> 00:31:17,107
My first observation

233
00:31:17,141 --> 00:31:19,944
of Sam was, he has the
same brown eyes as Rodney.

234
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:24,015
I can't believe it's
been four years.

235
00:31:26,083 --> 00:31:30,955
Maybe it's just my second
chance to... I don't know.

236
00:31:48,972 --> 00:31:51,408
Big plans for the
back yard?

237
00:31:51,442 --> 00:31:53,478
Dog, he thinks he's the dog.

238
00:31:55,278 --> 00:31:58,982
Maybe he just wants
to name the dog Sam.

239
00:31:59,016 --> 00:32:01,384
Before I got back here, did
you talk to him about mother?

240
00:32:01,417 --> 00:32:04,187
Did you tell him that she
treated you like an animal too?

241
00:32:04,221 --> 00:32:05,222
Why would I scare
him like that?

242
00:32:11,127 --> 00:32:12,062
Just fucking say it.

243
00:32:13,430 --> 00:32:15,600
I'm just some project to you.

244
00:32:19,169 --> 00:32:23,274
I'm here because I love you.

245
00:32:25,541 --> 00:32:31,749
I am here for you in this
house to find your pain.

246
00:32:31,781 --> 00:32:33,951
There is no you
and me... just you.

247
00:32:35,586 --> 00:32:36,721
Because of
some crazy title?

248
00:32:36,753 --> 00:32:40,256
Stop.
Stop.

249
00:32:40,289 --> 00:32:41,625
What if I got better?

250
00:32:44,627 --> 00:32:46,096
That's why we're here.

251
00:32:47,297 --> 00:32:48,333
Would you love me then?

252
00:32:51,167 --> 00:32:52,302
It would definitely
be easier, yes.

253
00:32:54,270 --> 00:32:56,374
Tomorrow night we
start hypnosis.

254
00:32:58,709 --> 00:33:02,145
This picture... this
is our starting point.

255
00:33:27,070 --> 00:33:29,039
You can be able to sleep
alone here tonight.

256
00:33:29,073 --> 00:33:30,074
You know why?

257
00:33:31,474 --> 00:33:32,442
I brought you one of my
shirts.

258
00:33:33,743 --> 00:33:34,711
Would you like to wear it?

259
00:33:48,826 --> 00:33:50,094
Our son used to wear
my shirts to sleep in.

260
00:33:54,230 --> 00:33:56,134
He said it made him feel
safe.

261
00:33:57,500 --> 00:33:59,069
He'd be about your age now.

262
00:34:02,605 --> 00:34:03,607
Am glad you found yourself.

263
00:34:06,477 --> 00:34:07,644
You know what?

264
00:34:10,179 --> 00:34:11,248
We're going to get your
lights in here fixed soon.

265
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:12,282
OK?

266
00:34:14,284 --> 00:34:15,286
Get some sleep.

267
00:34:52,588 --> 00:34:56,360
Sam, have you ever
used a spoon before?

268
00:34:58,327 --> 00:34:59,195
Let's try it.

269
00:34:59,228 --> 00:35:00,230
Let me see your hand.

270
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:03,867
Your going to grab it just
like that... real tight.

271
00:35:08,338 --> 00:35:10,708
All right, we'll go in...
got to get to the bottom.

272
00:35:10,740 --> 00:35:12,443
That's where the milk is...
see?

273
00:35:12,476 --> 00:35:13,544
A little bite... a little
bite... not too big.

274
00:35:13,577 --> 00:35:15,880
There you go.
See the milk?

275
00:35:15,913 --> 00:35:18,315
We then go in...
lift up... perfect.

276
00:35:19,449 --> 00:35:21,851
That's right.

277
00:35:21,885 --> 00:35:23,387
All the way to the
bottom... get that milk.

278
00:35:25,222 --> 00:35:26,224
That's a big bite.

279
00:35:29,259 --> 00:35:30,226
See?

280
00:35:30,260 --> 00:35:31,662
I told you it was a big bite.

281
00:35:31,695 --> 00:35:33,931
I'd do a little less than
that.

282
00:35:33,963 --> 00:35:37,300
And, Sam, make sure you drink
the milk when you finish.

283
00:35:37,333 --> 00:35:38,335
It's the best part.

284
00:35:40,304 --> 00:35:41,305
More.

285
00:35:46,309 --> 00:35:48,211
I've got some work to do.

286
00:35:48,244 --> 00:35:49,246
Good job, Sam.

287
00:37:08,492 --> 00:37:09,360
What's happening?

288
00:37:14,331 --> 00:37:15,666
You were touching things.

289
00:37:15,699 --> 00:37:17,934
Mhm.

290
00:37:17,967 --> 00:37:19,502
You felt the sensation
of that on your lips.

291
00:37:21,405 --> 00:37:24,775
It was metal mixed with
blood.

292
00:37:24,807 --> 00:37:25,775
What was in your
mouth last night?

293
00:37:32,382 --> 00:37:37,320
And you made her put
that bit in your mouth.

294
00:37:37,353 --> 00:37:42,492
She would just stick
it in and hold my nose

295
00:37:44,427 --> 00:37:45,895
and caress my hands.

296
00:37:48,565 --> 00:37:52,469
Talk to mother now...
not the little girl.

297
00:37:52,501 --> 00:37:53,971
Talk to mom.

298
00:37:55,472 --> 00:37:57,375
I didn't mean to
bite you, mother.

299
00:37:58,809 --> 00:38:03,314
But you just... you
kept pushing it in.

300
00:38:03,347 --> 00:38:05,916
Tell her how much you hate
her.

301
00:38:05,949 --> 00:38:07,684
Don't you talk to me that
way.

302
00:38:10,353 --> 00:38:13,456
Fiends...
they are coming.

303
00:38:13,489 --> 00:38:15,391
Let them out.

304
00:38:15,425 --> 00:38:17,394
My baby.

305
00:38:17,427 --> 00:38:19,596
My baby.

306
00:38:19,628 --> 00:38:23,500
You can't hurt my
baby that way.

307
00:38:23,532 --> 00:38:24,835
And I trained you so well.

308
00:38:27,503 --> 00:38:30,074
The weak one get it the
worst.

309
00:38:30,106 --> 00:38:33,443
But it's for their own good.

310
00:38:33,476 --> 00:38:35,346
They survive.

311
00:38:35,378 --> 00:38:38,581
They become the master.

312
00:38:38,614 --> 00:38:39,982
What does that mean?

313
00:38:40,016 --> 00:38:43,052
Or is it you?

314
00:38:58,434 --> 00:39:00,137
What did you do to me?

315
00:39:00,170 --> 00:39:01,438
It's all right.

316
00:39:01,471 --> 00:39:02,440
You came so far just now.

317
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:09,513
What's coming out is exactly
what I knew we could find here.

318
00:39:12,481 --> 00:39:16,420
Don't tell me... don't
tell me... not one

319
00:39:16,452 --> 00:39:17,954
word of what I just said.

320
00:39:17,987 --> 00:39:18,855
It's OK.

321
00:39:19,789 --> 00:39:20,590
Here.

322
00:39:21,824 --> 00:39:23,827
After the initial
hypnosis session.

323
00:39:25,528 --> 00:39:28,398
There's great evidence MPD.

324
00:39:28,431 --> 00:39:31,668
The patient speaks in two
distinct personalities.

325
00:41:13,737 --> 00:41:14,872
I don't have time to play
hangman right now, partner.

326
00:41:16,739 --> 00:41:18,508
I got to go to town
and get supplies.

327
00:41:18,541 --> 00:41:20,810
We have a lot of work
to do around here.

328
00:41:20,844 --> 00:41:22,546
I need you to be
man of the house.

329
00:41:25,181 --> 00:41:26,217
You guys will be OK without
me.

330
00:41:27,684 --> 00:41:28,686
Keep around Darcy.

331
00:41:34,757 --> 00:41:37,527
I made this for you
in case you got hungry.

332
00:41:37,561 --> 00:41:38,696
Thank you.

333
00:41:40,563 --> 00:41:43,533
Don't try to do too
much around here, OK?

334
00:41:43,567 --> 00:41:45,635
Maybe you and Sam can work
on the tree house.

335
00:41:45,668 --> 00:41:46,769
That sound good?

336
00:41:47,871 --> 00:41:48,873
OK.

337
00:42:41,324 --> 00:42:42,925
Yeah, I know you're here.

338
00:43:49,224 --> 00:43:53,797
Sam, you know the
rules... her rules.

339
00:44:00,036 --> 00:44:05,842
Remember the story about the
disobedient horse wandering

340
00:44:05,875 --> 00:44:10,648
in the woods sad because
his monster didn't want him?

341
00:44:12,748 --> 00:44:14,283
He began to enjoy his
freedom.

342
00:44:15,818 --> 00:44:18,822
He felt wild and alive.

343
00:44:18,855 --> 00:44:22,693
But soon he began to
feel terribly lonely.

344
00:44:22,726 --> 00:44:24,394
And he knew that he had no
one to take care of him.

345
00:44:26,762 --> 00:44:31,768
And what he didn't know
was that deep in the woods

346
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:33,737
a man was drawing a dark
plan.

347
00:44:35,472 --> 00:44:38,307
He had set a trap for
the little horse...

348
00:44:38,340 --> 00:44:40,911
made of flowers
and sweet grass.

349
00:44:44,347 --> 00:44:45,315
Hey, Sam.

350
00:44:48,083 --> 00:44:49,318
What you doing?

351
00:44:50,487 --> 00:44:51,689
Can I see it?

352
00:44:58,795 --> 00:44:59,829
You didn't go in the
woods today did you, Sam?

353
00:44:59,862 --> 00:45:00,730
No.

354
00:45:02,931 --> 00:45:03,933
And you didn't
board up with Ken.

355
00:45:12,074 --> 00:45:13,342
Got something for you.

356
00:45:15,911 --> 00:45:16,913
Open.

357
00:45:20,449 --> 00:45:21,451
Take one out.

358
00:45:23,418 --> 00:45:24,754
See?

359
00:45:24,788 --> 00:45:26,824
Now we have a whole
crayon each.

360
00:45:28,391 --> 00:45:29,393
You like that?

361
00:45:33,061 --> 00:45:35,831
Do you know anything
about electrical wiring?

362
00:45:35,864 --> 00:45:37,767
Because I got to take
care of some of the parts.

363
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:38,869
Then we can get that light
in the room fixed, OK?

364
00:45:54,449 --> 00:45:58,387
Hey, Sam, I need you
to do me a favor.

365
00:45:58,420 --> 00:46:00,356
Go tell Darcy to
kill the breaker.

366
00:46:00,389 --> 00:46:02,158
Can you do that for me?

367
00:46:02,192 --> 00:46:03,860
Kill the breaker.

368
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:18,541
R- E-A-K-E-R... perfect.

369
00:46:35,224 --> 00:46:36,826
Are we clear?

370
00:46:50,273 --> 00:46:51,275
Dammit!

371
00:46:57,880 --> 00:46:59,548
Why didn't you
kill the breaker?

372
00:46:59,581 --> 00:47:00,983
What are you talking about?

373
00:47:01,016 --> 00:47:02,384
I just got electrocuted.

374
00:47:02,418 --> 00:47:03,954
Sam, did you tell her
to kill the breaker?

375
00:47:03,987 --> 00:47:05,255
He didn't tell
me anything, Ryan.

376
00:47:05,288 --> 00:47:06,489
He doesn't talk.

377
00:47:06,521 --> 00:47:08,023
I saw him write it down,
Darcy.

378
00:47:08,056 --> 00:47:09,192
Let us see your hands.

379
00:47:09,224 --> 00:47:10,960
There's no need
to see my hands.

380
00:47:10,994 --> 00:47:12,562
Next time, you do
what I tell you, OK?

381
00:47:12,594 --> 00:47:13,863
Let go of him.

382
00:47:15,565 --> 00:47:16,567
Why would you do that?

383
00:48:35,711 --> 00:48:37,581
And you see why you
have to listen to mom.

384
00:48:40,215 --> 00:48:44,153
Disobedience gets you hurt.

385
00:48:44,186 --> 00:48:47,223
And the only way to stay
safe is to stay close to me.

386
00:48:50,326 --> 00:48:53,228
Don't turn away from me, Sam.

387
00:48:53,262 --> 00:48:56,499
Let me protect you from her.

388
00:48:56,532 --> 00:49:00,704
And she'll haunt your
dreams like she does mine.

389
00:49:07,175 --> 00:49:13,717
() I found
a fresh wound on Sam's back

390
00:49:17,253 --> 00:49:20,023
in the shape of a dark
circle.

391
00:49:20,056 --> 00:49:23,693
Prior to that, I found
a ringing music box.

392
00:49:27,030 --> 00:49:28,065
I don't want to see
that side of you again.

393
00:49:29,431 --> 00:49:30,299
It won't happen again.

394
00:49:32,201 --> 00:49:35,137
And what you did today is
not going to help Sam heal.

395
00:49:37,273 --> 00:49:39,041
I'll apologize to
him when I see him.

396
00:49:41,043 --> 00:49:42,711
If you don't mind, I
have some work to do.

397
00:49:42,744 --> 00:49:46,048
And I would like some space.

398
00:49:46,081 --> 00:49:47,549
You're not telling him to
kill the breaker

399
00:49:47,583 --> 00:49:49,552
and running into the woods.

400
00:49:49,585 --> 00:49:51,755
That's him testing me.

401
00:49:51,788 --> 00:49:52,688
I can't let him think
he's in control.

402
00:49:58,126 --> 00:50:01,364
You want to break
us just like she did...

403
00:50:01,396 --> 00:50:04,701
make us feel beneath you.

404
00:50:06,735 --> 00:50:08,704
Sam and I are your equal, right?

405
00:50:10,239 --> 00:50:13,275
I will not let you control us.

406
00:50:13,309 --> 00:50:14,611
Look, I'm trying to keep you
both from harming yourselves.

407
00:50:16,079 --> 00:50:16,747
Children need boundaries.

408
00:50:29,291 --> 00:50:30,259
Fuck off.

409
00:50:48,277 --> 00:50:49,646
Sam!

410
00:50:49,679 --> 00:50:52,215
Sam!

411
00:50:52,248 --> 00:50:53,083
Where are you?

412
00:50:53,115 --> 00:50:54,617
Sam.

413
00:50:54,650 --> 00:50:56,286
Where are you?

414
00:50:56,318 --> 00:50:58,121
Ryan.

415
00:50:58,153 --> 00:50:59,255
Ryan, wake up.

416
00:50:59,288 --> 00:51:00,556
Wake up. I can't find him.

417
00:51:03,291 --> 00:51:05,561
Sam, he wasn't in his room.

418
00:51:05,594 --> 00:51:06,663
I can't find him.

419
00:51:06,695 --> 00:51:08,130
He's not in his room.

420
00:51:08,164 --> 00:51:09,232
Maybe he went outside.

421
00:51:09,264 --> 00:51:10,132
OK.

422
00:51:10,166 --> 00:51:11,501
OK, I'll go look.

423
00:51:11,534 --> 00:51:12,469
I'll look.

424
00:51:43,398 --> 00:51:45,167
Sam?

425
00:51:45,201 --> 00:51:46,702
How did you get in here?

426
00:51:46,735 --> 00:51:47,804
How did you get in here, bub?

427
00:51:52,375 --> 00:51:56,179
Sam, I'm sorry I yelled at
you.

428
00:51:56,211 --> 00:51:58,849
It wasn't your fault. You don't
need to be in this room.

429
00:52:00,782 --> 00:52:02,284
Why don't you come with me?

430
00:52:02,318 --> 00:52:03,286
Let's get you cleaned
up, all right?

431
00:52:05,454 --> 00:52:06,456
All right.

432
00:52:08,324 --> 00:52:09,326
Right.

433
00:52:25,775 --> 00:52:28,311
I think it's the perfect day
to start on Sam's hideaway.

434
00:52:30,512 --> 00:52:31,914
There's no place for Sam
to hide... not from her.

435
00:52:42,391 --> 00:52:44,927
There's no one here
to hide from, Sam.

436
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:46,395
So you don't have
to go on that road.

437
00:52:48,364 --> 00:52:49,365
You'll have your own place.

438
00:52:50,632 --> 00:52:51,634
Isn't that what you want?

439
00:52:53,335 --> 00:52:55,204
She can't make me come there.

440
00:52:55,237 --> 00:52:57,406
You said so, right?

441
00:52:57,440 --> 00:53:00,677
Sam, who did this to you?

442
00:53:02,878 --> 00:53:03,880
Was it Darcy?

443
00:53:08,617 --> 00:53:09,552
Was it mother?

444
00:53:16,592 --> 00:53:19,262
There is no mother.

445
00:53:43,385 --> 00:53:44,454
Running.

446
00:53:46,389 --> 00:53:49,526
I was running in the
woods looking for Sam.

447
00:53:51,460 --> 00:53:54,297
And she was chasing me.

448
00:53:54,329 --> 00:53:58,768
My mother... she didn't... she
didn't want me to give to you.

449
00:54:02,438 --> 00:54:04,440
I found him in a pen.

450
00:54:04,472 --> 00:54:05,375
You did?

451
00:54:06,474 --> 00:54:07,576
Thank god.

452
00:54:16,385 --> 00:54:17,387
How did you get
in there, Darcy?

453
00:54:19,655 --> 00:54:20,690
What do you mean?

454
00:54:21,891 --> 00:54:23,425
I mean, the boards
were taken down.

455
00:54:23,458 --> 00:54:24,326
And they were put back up.

456
00:54:25,661 --> 00:54:26,663
He was locked in there.

457
00:54:28,364 --> 00:54:29,565
Someone put him in there.

458
00:54:29,597 --> 00:54:30,900
It wasn't me.

459
00:54:32,467 --> 00:54:33,402
It was her.

460
00:54:34,603 --> 00:54:36,773
And she's not...
she's not dead, Ryan.

461
00:54:41,409 --> 00:54:42,378
He just talked to me.

462
00:54:43,679 --> 00:54:44,947
What did he tell you?

463
00:54:46,815 --> 00:54:47,817
Tell me what?

464
00:54:49,518 --> 00:54:50,952
Anything.

465
00:54:50,985 --> 00:54:52,788
Yes, he did.

466
00:54:52,822 --> 00:54:53,823
What did he say?

467
00:54:57,492 --> 00:54:59,295
He said, there is no mother.

468
00:55:22,050 --> 00:55:23,052
Sam.

469
00:55:24,954 --> 00:55:27,490
Ryan told me you spoke to
him.

470
00:55:31,427 --> 00:55:33,663
Did you say something to
Ryan.

471
00:55:42,704 --> 00:55:44,773
He doesn't live in our skin.

472
00:55:47,443 --> 00:55:50,714
You see, he wants
to fix our heart

473
00:55:53,047 --> 00:55:56,618
when he doesn't understand
our heart is not broken.

474
00:55:58,920 --> 00:56:00,956
It never worked
right from the start.

475
00:56:03,425 --> 00:56:05,628
But that's our secret, OK.

476
00:56:05,661 --> 00:56:07,764
All we have to do is act.

477
00:56:09,864 --> 00:56:13,502
Act like we're better and
then we can leave this place.

478
00:57:28,844 --> 00:57:30,213
I bet you worked up
quite an appetite?

479
00:57:30,246 --> 00:57:31,213
Yes.

480
00:57:31,246 --> 00:57:32,449
Yes, I did.

481
00:57:36,784 --> 00:57:39,788
Sam, is there anything
I can say or do

482
00:57:39,822 --> 00:57:40,824
to help you get the words
out?

483
00:57:48,264 --> 00:57:49,566
It's lunchtime, guys.

484
00:57:54,670 --> 00:57:55,637
He's getting better.

485
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:19,962
Now I am in the dark.

486
00:58:21,230 --> 00:58:22,231
Now I am in the room.

487
00:58:23,331 --> 00:58:24,600
What room?

488
00:58:26,101 --> 00:58:27,103
The pen?

489
00:58:28,070 --> 00:58:29,072
Yes.

490
00:58:32,574 --> 00:58:33,708
Are you...

491
00:58:36,612 --> 00:58:40,182
There's someone.

492
00:58:40,215 --> 00:58:41,717
Ask them who they are.

493
00:58:41,750 --> 00:58:42,751
Who are you?

494
00:58:47,722 --> 00:58:48,690
It's Darcy.

495
00:58:51,994 --> 00:58:52,996
Hi, Darcy.

496
00:58:55,797 --> 00:58:56,798
Who was I just talking to?

497
00:58:58,166 --> 00:58:59,235
I don't know.

498
00:59:03,304 --> 00:59:04,839
Who else is in there with
you?

499
00:59:04,873 --> 00:59:06,309
Don't do that.

500
00:59:07,275 --> 00:59:09,611
Don't do that.

501
00:59:09,644 --> 00:59:11,980
She's going to hear you.

502
00:59:12,014 --> 00:59:13,016
Stop it.

503
00:59:18,086 --> 00:59:19,088
Darcy.

504
00:59:24,126 --> 00:59:27,230
You never listen to mother!

505
00:59:28,630 --> 00:59:30,865
That's why we're here.

506
00:59:30,898 --> 00:59:32,101
I love you!

507
00:59:32,134 --> 00:59:33,135
I love you!

508
00:59:46,014 --> 00:59:48,083
God.

509
00:59:48,117 --> 00:59:50,086
What happened?

510
00:59:50,119 --> 00:59:51,721
What did I do?

511
00:59:52,920 --> 00:59:53,922
It's OK.

512
00:59:55,090 --> 00:59:56,892
You didn't do anything.

513
00:59:56,925 --> 00:59:58,193
It was my fault.

514
00:59:59,695 --> 01:00:00,696
Are you sure?

515
01:00:00,728 --> 01:00:02,063
Yeah, positive.

516
01:00:02,097 --> 01:00:04,133
You did great.

517
01:00:04,166 --> 01:00:05,167
We just had a breakthrough.

518
01:00:05,199 --> 01:00:06,402
Really?

519
01:00:06,434 --> 01:00:07,670
Yeah. Really.

520
01:00:08,737 --> 01:00:09,606
Yeah. I'm proud of you.

521
01:00:12,407 --> 01:00:14,676
Why don't you get
rid of the meds.

522
01:00:17,246 --> 01:00:18,713
No pills?

523
01:00:18,746 --> 01:00:20,048
No.

524
01:00:20,081 --> 01:00:21,683
No, you're good.

525
01:00:21,717 --> 01:00:23,019
Let me finish up some work,
OK?

526
01:00:23,052 --> 01:00:24,053
OK.

527
01:01:11,467 --> 01:01:12,367
What is it, Sam?

528
01:01:20,775 --> 01:01:21,810
Sam?

529
01:01:21,844 --> 01:01:22,811
What happened?

530
01:01:23,746 --> 01:01:25,347
What did you dream?

531
01:01:25,380 --> 01:01:26,382
Did you do anything?
Are you hurt?

532
01:01:26,414 --> 01:01:27,382
Sam.

533
01:01:27,416 --> 01:01:29,018
What's wrong?

534
01:01:29,050 --> 01:01:30,385
I don't know.

535
01:01:30,418 --> 01:01:31,687
It's blood.

536
01:01:33,822 --> 01:01:35,291
Why is his towel bloody?

537
01:01:35,324 --> 01:01:37,360
Sam, go to the bathroom.

538
01:01:56,244 --> 01:01:58,780
Why did you use that towel?

539
01:01:58,813 --> 01:01:59,781
Didn't you see the blood on
it?

540
01:03:35,443 --> 01:03:36,978
Spavine.

541
01:03:42,251 --> 01:03:44,821
Don't you ever call me that?

542
01:03:46,989 --> 01:03:47,990
That's your name, isn't it?

543
01:03:51,425 --> 01:03:53,461
You're supposed to
be looking after me.

544
01:03:55,063 --> 01:03:56,932
You don't know
anything about her.

545
01:03:59,201 --> 01:04:00,403
Then tell me about her.

546
01:04:02,103 --> 01:04:05,206
There was another just like
me.

547
01:04:05,239 --> 01:04:06,575
But no more.

548
01:04:08,476 --> 01:04:09,911
Spavine died in that pen.

549
01:04:12,614 --> 01:04:15,851
Don't you ever let that
name come from your lips.

550
01:04:17,552 --> 01:04:21,390
I can't help you if you
keep secrets from me.

551
01:04:22,958 --> 01:04:26,262
This is my
darkness... not yours.

552
01:04:27,929 --> 01:04:32,333
This belongs to Sam and I.
We carry that name.

553
01:04:32,367 --> 01:04:33,369
No.

554
01:04:34,503 --> 01:04:35,571
Sam doesn't have your wounds.

555
01:04:37,539 --> 01:04:39,041
You want him to be like you.

556
01:04:40,409 --> 01:04:41,410
He's not.

557
01:04:42,443 --> 01:04:43,646
You don't know what he feels.

558
01:04:45,047 --> 01:04:46,048
I do.

559
01:04:48,951 --> 01:04:53,989
Sam and I... we walked
through that hell.

560
01:04:54,021 --> 01:04:57,960
And you... you just write
about it in your little book.

561
01:05:01,063 --> 01:05:04,666
Spavine, she was
my sister, Ryan.

562
01:05:09,271 --> 01:05:10,205
Sam.

563
01:05:10,237 --> 01:05:11,239
Sam.

564
01:05:17,144 --> 01:05:19,681
Why is he throwing up worms?

565
01:05:19,715 --> 01:05:21,317
It's common in
the country, Ryan.

566
01:05:21,349 --> 01:05:23,052
Kids get worms.

567
01:05:23,085 --> 01:05:24,286
You go to the pharmacy.

568
01:05:24,318 --> 01:05:26,154
They'll know what he needs.

569
01:05:26,188 --> 01:05:27,256
No. I need to take him to a clinic
so they can take a look at him.

570
01:05:27,289 --> 01:05:28,357
No, you go.

571
01:05:28,389 --> 01:05:29,991
We'll be fine.

572
01:05:30,025 --> 01:05:31,027
Just go.

573
01:05:49,110 --> 01:05:54,951
Baby, what did mom tell you
about becoming an animal.

574
01:05:58,186 --> 01:06:00,323
Animals have worms,
Sam... not little boys.

575
01:06:03,257 --> 01:06:05,526
You are not one of them.

576
01:06:05,559 --> 01:06:07,228
And I am not either.

577
01:06:08,496 --> 01:06:10,365
Ryan put that thought in you.

578
01:06:11,733 --> 01:06:13,135
And you have to
fight against it.

579
01:06:20,675 --> 01:06:22,577
Did you know that animals
are incapable of love?

580
01:06:24,713 --> 01:06:28,751
It's false when they
show you affection.

581
01:06:28,784 --> 01:06:32,121
When I tell you I love you,
it's because I'm not an animal.

582
01:06:33,554 --> 01:06:36,257
I am your mother.

583
01:07:31,545 --> 01:07:32,547
Hey Sam.

584
01:07:40,355 --> 01:07:42,557
No, no games.

585
01:07:42,590 --> 01:07:44,059
I need to ask you some
things.

586
01:07:57,172 --> 01:07:58,307
What does that mean to you?

587
01:09:18,319 --> 01:09:19,420
She had other children.

588
01:09:35,936 --> 01:09:41,376
Sam has shown me the remains
that was other children.

589
01:09:46,648 --> 01:09:48,250
The causes of death unknown.

590
01:09:55,489 --> 01:09:59,360
My immediate concern is Darcy
has a neurotic disorder that's

591
01:09:59,394 --> 01:10:05,900
causing her to succumb to
the personality of mother.

592
01:10:14,509 --> 01:10:17,479
She is clearly unaware
that this alter ego exists.

593
01:10:20,282 --> 01:10:24,286
The mother exists.

594
01:10:27,454 --> 01:10:33,628
And is slowly becoming... it's
becoming a dominant personality.

595
01:10:39,600 --> 01:10:40,935
When mother...

596
01:12:13,395 --> 01:12:16,698
Will you leave us alone?

597
01:12:16,730 --> 01:12:17,899
Do you hear me, mother?

598
01:12:25,038 --> 01:12:26,474
We're not your beasts.

599
01:12:30,578 --> 01:12:37,486
Our love is stronger than
your leather ties and whips.

600
01:12:50,431 --> 01:12:51,432
No.

601
01:15:07,569 --> 01:15:10,071
There is no reason for such
an anatomic abnormality.

602
01:15:10,104 --> 01:15:14,208
The child is severely
undersized for the pictures.

603
01:15:14,242 --> 01:15:16,610
It appears she has
two sets of teeth...

604
01:15:16,644 --> 01:15:18,847
the straining harness
used on her body

605
01:15:18,880 --> 01:15:22,083
to mobilize her... big, white
callous... heavy black bruising

606
01:15:22,115 --> 01:15:24,118
on the buttocks.

607
01:15:24,152 --> 01:15:26,954
There are no pictures of the
child crying in all the time

608
01:15:26,988 --> 01:15:28,957
that she's seen.

609
01:15:28,989 --> 01:15:33,594
It's producing pleasures
when submersed in water.

610
01:15:33,627 --> 01:15:35,630
It seems cheap.

611
01:15:35,662 --> 01:15:38,199
Like she feels sensations
associated with water.

612
01:15:46,173 --> 01:15:49,310
That's it. Water.

613
01:15:54,082 --> 01:15:55,083
Where did this go wrong?

614
01:16:01,689 --> 01:16:02,657
Look, you were right.

615
01:16:02,689 --> 01:16:03,692
This is out of my control.

616
01:16:07,795 --> 01:16:09,297
I'm going to sedate her
and bring her back.

617
01:16:10,364 --> 01:16:11,632
() Really?

618
01:16:11,666 --> 01:16:13,635
Glad you see you
came to your senses

619
01:16:13,667 --> 01:16:15,670
but the damage
has already been done.

620
01:16:15,703 --> 01:16:17,606
I used to be just like you.

621
01:16:17,639 --> 01:16:19,140
I thought I could
cure them all.

622
01:16:19,172 --> 01:16:20,841
Will you just shut the fuck
up?

623
01:16:20,875 --> 01:16:22,777
All right, listen,
I need a favor.

624
01:16:22,810 --> 01:16:23,778
() No.

625
01:16:23,810 --> 01:16:24,778
I don't know where she is.

626
01:16:24,811 --> 01:16:25,779
And she has my gun.

627
01:16:25,813 --> 01:16:26,815
() Good.

628
01:16:30,717 --> 01:16:31,653
() 911.

629
01:16:31,685 --> 01:16:32,753
What's your emergency?

630
01:16:32,787 --> 01:16:36,091
Hi, this is Doctor
Ryan Andrews.

631
01:16:36,123 --> 01:16:39,693
And I've got a patient of mine
here at... give just one second.

632
01:16:39,726 --> 01:16:40,662
Who are you talking to?

633
01:16:46,400 --> 01:16:48,036
() Sir?
Sir?

634
01:16:48,069 --> 01:16:51,640
Just checking my voice-mail.

635
01:16:51,672 --> 01:16:53,875
() Sir,
what is your location?

636
01:16:53,908 --> 01:16:55,276
Sir?

637
01:16:55,309 --> 01:16:57,378
Why do you
have a knife, Darcy?

638
01:16:57,412 --> 01:17:01,115
I had to cut her out.

639
01:17:01,149 --> 01:17:04,819
I need to take Sam to town.
It's the worms.

640
01:17:04,851 --> 01:17:06,654
I think it's serious.

641
01:17:06,688 --> 01:17:07,855
He belongs to me.

642
01:17:09,890 --> 01:17:11,893
He's your son, isn't
he?

643
01:17:11,926 --> 01:17:12,794
Yes.

644
01:17:14,295 --> 01:17:15,697
Who am I talking to right
now?

645
01:17:16,963 --> 01:17:18,233
Spavine.

646
01:17:19,766 --> 01:17:20,735
That's what I thought.

647
01:17:22,770 --> 01:17:23,739
There is no mother, is there?

648
01:17:25,006 --> 01:17:26,274
Of course there is.

649
01:17:27,809 --> 01:17:29,878
Sam, come to mother.

650
01:17:31,311 --> 01:17:33,381
Stay right there, Sam.

651
01:17:33,413 --> 01:17:35,216
Sam, you don't
have to go with her.

652
01:17:36,850 --> 01:17:38,719
You have been a bad boy.

653
01:17:40,387 --> 01:17:43,257
It's time for you
to go into the pen.

654
01:17:43,291 --> 01:17:45,293
And don't worry.

655
01:17:45,326 --> 01:17:47,261
You have been a bad boy too.

656
01:17:47,295 --> 01:17:48,764
And you are next.

657
01:18:23,096 --> 01:18:24,099
Where are you?

658
01:18:36,911 --> 01:18:37,913
I know you're here.

659
01:18:40,381 --> 01:18:44,285
I can smell you...
taste you in the air.

660
01:19:59,993 --> 01:20:01,796
I want you to put
the gun down, OK?

661
01:20:05,198 --> 01:20:06,867
It's OK.

662
01:20:06,900 --> 01:20:08,269
Just put the gun
down, that's enough.

663
01:20:13,073 --> 01:20:15,442
You're safe with me, OK?

664
01:20:15,475 --> 01:20:17,945
OK, I will protect you.

665
01:20:24,318 --> 01:20:25,854
You will?

666
01:20:25,886 --> 01:20:26,887
Yes.

667
01:20:27,520 --> 01:20:29,323
Now, please put the gun down.

668
01:20:34,996 --> 01:20:38,166
Sam, did Darcy do these
horrible things to you?

669
01:20:40,268 --> 01:20:42,036
Is someone else here?

670
01:20:42,069 --> 01:20:44,405
Is mother here?

671
01:20:44,438 --> 01:20:46,942
Mother... Spavine.

672
01:20:48,242 --> 01:20:49,244
OK, come on.

673
01:20:53,280 --> 01:20:54,216
OK, let's go.

674
01:21:04,992 --> 01:21:06,494
I want you to wait
right here buddy.

675
01:21:11,198 --> 01:21:13,034
I need you to wait right
here, OK... be right back.

676
01:22:33,113 --> 01:22:34,114
Sam!

677
01:23:14,622 --> 01:23:15,757
Let's tell a new story.

678
01:23:19,359 --> 01:23:24,197
This one is about a baby
horse who was warned

679
01:23:24,230 --> 01:23:26,033
not to go into the woods.

680
01:23:27,801 --> 01:23:31,038
His mother warned him to
the beware of the wolf who

681
01:23:31,072 --> 01:23:34,775
lived there and wanted
nothing more than to make

682
01:23:34,809 --> 01:23:36,543
a meal of her little fawn.

683
01:23:38,679 --> 01:23:42,250
But her little horse was too
curious for his own good.

684
01:23:42,283 --> 01:23:43,351
He disobeyed.

685
01:24:51,719 --> 01:24:52,720
Sam!

686
01:25:09,170 --> 01:25:10,270
Sam?

687
01:25:10,304 --> 01:25:11,139
Sam, come here.

688
01:25:11,171 --> 01:25:11,905
Come here.

689
01:25:11,939 --> 01:25:14,142
Sam.
Let's go.
