 It's a great day for America,

             It's--

10
00:02:02,356 --> 00:02:04,189
    It's a great day for me.

11
00:02:04,191 --> 00:02:07,893
 I finally get to use my sign!

12
00:02:07,895 --> 00:02:10,796
    You'd be surprised
how many times in America

13
00:02:10,798 --> 00:02:12,664
 they're not that happy to see
        that sign.

14
00:02:12,666 --> 00:02:14,266
      We've been touring.

15
00:02:14,268 --> 00:02:16,401
     They're like, "This is
  Greensboro, North Carolina.

16
00:02:16,403 --> 00:02:19,138
             Boo!"

17
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:21,974
      Who's smoking weed?
    I can smell weed.

18
00:02:21,976 --> 00:02:24,042
         What the fuck?

19
00:02:26,246 --> 00:02:29,414
 Look, this is an intervention.
Actually, I'm not doing a show.

20
00:02:29,416 --> 00:02:31,817
         We're worried
      about your weed use.

21
00:02:34,888 --> 00:02:36,722
You got any weed up there
      in the cheap seats?

22
00:02:36,724 --> 00:02:38,524
  Any weed going on up there?

23
00:02:38,526 --> 00:02:40,292
     [cheers and applause]

00:02:40,294 --> 00:02:42,060
         [Craig laughs]

25
00:02:42,062 --> 00:02:43,962
I'm very happy to be here.
 If you've ever seen me before,

26
00:02:43,964 --> 00:02:46,498
  first of all, I apologize--
          no refunds.

27
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,233
         And secondly,

28
00:02:48,235 --> 00:02:50,569
you know what I like to do
 every evening is tell a joke,

29
00:02:50,571 --> 00:02:53,539
         just one joke,
    but a great joke--

30
00:02:53,541 --> 00:02:56,708
  the best joke in the world.

31
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:58,477
     Yeah. No, that's true.
      If you Google the--

32
00:02:58,479 --> 00:03:00,913
        [light applause]
          - All right.

33
00:03:00,915 --> 00:03:06,084
    I want to encourage you.
        No, the--

34
00:03:06,086 --> 00:03:07,386
        [applause]

35
00:03:07,388 --> 00:03:09,188
        No, no, no, no.
          I'm over it.

36
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:10,989
         Anyway, look,
  this is the number-one joke

37
00:03:10,991 --> 00:03:12,758
    in the English language,
        this joke,

38
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:14,660
    and the number-one joke
     in the United States.

39
00:03:14,662 --> 00:03:16,161
    And if you know anything
        about me,

40
00:03:16,163 --> 00:03:17,629
          you know I'm
a very patriotic American.

41
00:03:17,631 --> 00:03:19,798
     No irony, no bullshit,
        very patriotic.

42
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:22,768
    I start every show with
"It's a great day for America."

43
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:24,369
        That's my thing.
    That's my catch--

44
00:03:24,371 --> 00:03:27,039
     [cheers and applause]
Don't. No, it's all right.

45
00:03:27,041 --> 00:03:29,975
     It's my catchphrase--
"It's a great day for America."

46
00:03:29,977 --> 00:03:31,443
  I tried other catchphrases.

47
00:03:31,445 --> 00:03:34,046
            I tried,
     "That sounded dirty."

48
00:03:34,048 --> 00:03:36,448
        [laughter]

49
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:39,051
 Just kind of creep people out.

50
00:03:39,053 --> 00:03:41,119
        And then,
"See you in hell, <i>amigos!"</i>

51
00:03:41,121 --> 00:03:44,323
And nobody could make any sense
          of that one.

52
00:03:44,325 --> 00:03:47,059
My own personal favorite--
     "Fuck you, Dr. Phil!"

53
00:03:47,061 --> 00:03:48,227
             But...

54
00:03:48,229 --> 00:03:49,895
    [laughter and applause]

55
00:03:49,897 --> 00:03:52,364
     None of them took off,
so it's a great day for America.

56
00:03:52,366 --> 00:03:54,099
  That's my thing that I say.

57
00:03:54,101 --> 00:03:56,068
 That's the one I'll be saying
    for the rest of my life.

58
00:03:56,070 --> 00:03:58,337
 That's the one I'll be saying
    when I'm doing ads

59
00:03:58,339 --> 00:04:01,106
for local car dealerships.

60
00:04:01,108 --> 00:04:04,042
  Come on down to Toyotathon,
        cheeky monkeys.

61
00:04:04,044 --> 00:04:06,445
      Look at these deals
    in new and used models.

62
00:04:06,447 --> 00:04:08,714
 It's a great day for America.

63
00:04:08,716 --> 00:04:12,784
        [laughter]

64
00:04:12,786 --> 00:04:15,120
    That's the big blowy guy
        out front.

65
00:04:15,122 --> 00:04:16,054
         I don't know.

66
00:04:16,056 --> 00:04:17,522
  Oh, I see what you're doing.

67
00:04:17,524 --> 00:04:19,057
     It's the big blowy guy
        out front.

68
00:04:19,059 --> 00:04:21,526
    Did any of you see
  the big blowy guy out front?

69
00:04:21,528 --> 00:04:24,263
    Hello. I think you know
        what I'm saying.

70
00:04:24,265 --> 00:04:26,098
            [laughs]

71
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:28,433
  It's not a great idea having
  a catchphrase, to be honest,

72
00:04:28,435 --> 00:04:29,901
      if you do what I do,

73
00:04:29,903 --> 00:04:33,005
 because people get very angry
    if you forget to say it.

74
00:04:33,007 --> 00:04:37,509
I won't say where, but recently
 in Greensboro, North Carolina,

75
00:04:37,511 --> 00:04:40,145
I came out, and I forgot to say,
"It's a great day for America,"

76
00:04:40,147 --> 00:04:42,247
and there was a gentleman
         waiting for me

77
00:04:42,249 --> 00:04:43,415
    at the stage door.

78
00:04:43,417 --> 00:04:45,017
And I'm not talking, like,
          in Broadway,

79
00:04:45,019 --> 00:04:46,818
    where the gentleman has
     a top hat and a scarf

80
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:49,254
and says, "Can I take you
to a supper club, young missy?"

81
00:04:49,256 --> 00:04:50,355
        I mean...

82
00:04:50,357 --> 00:04:53,592
        [laughter]

83
00:04:53,594 --> 00:04:55,227
  Ooh, here's hoping tonight.

84
00:04:55,229 --> 00:04:57,996
        But, no, I mean,
    there was a guy waiting.

85
00:04:57,998 --> 00:05:00,065
    I think--I'm pretty sure
         he was armed.

86
00:05:00,067 --> 00:05:03,168
He was like, "Why didn't you say
it was a great day for America?"

87
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:05,337
          I was like,
     "I just forgot, man."

88
00:05:05,339 --> 00:05:07,773
 He's like, "You didn't forget.
I know what you're doing.

89
00:05:07,775 --> 00:05:11,543
    I seen <i>Homeland."</i>

90
00:05:11,545 --> 00:05:13,111
          It was like,
      "No, man, I forgot."

91
00:05:13,113 --> 00:05:15,213
     People get mad at you
    if you forget to say it,

92
00:05:15,215 --> 00:05:17,182
and people get mad at you
         if you say it.

93
00:05:17,184 --> 00:05:19,418
There's always one every night,
  if I come out and I'm like,

94
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:21,453
     "Oh, it's a great day
    for America," they'll be

95
00:05:21,455 --> 00:05:24,056
somebody like, "Why is it
a great day for America, Craig?

96
00:05:24,058 --> 00:05:27,726
  My cat got shingles today."

97
00:05:27,728 --> 00:05:30,362
        [laughter]

98
00:05:30,364 --> 00:05:33,999
    "My cat, which is
 coincidentally named America."

99
00:05:34,001 --> 00:05:37,836
        [laughter]

100
00:05:37,838 --> 00:05:39,771
        It's all right.
    Cats can't get shingles.

101
00:05:39,773 --> 00:05:41,239
    It's just a joke.

102
00:05:41,241 --> 00:05:43,241
I don't think they can get
    shingles, anyway.

103
00:05:43,243 --> 00:05:45,577
I don't know, I'm not a doctor,
just like Dr. Phil isn't.

104
00:05:45,579 --> 00:05:48,714
    [laughter and applause]

105
00:05:48,716 --> 00:05:50,282
    No, I don't know.

106
00:05:50,284 --> 00:05:53,819
Shingles is--I mean, I wouldn't
    wish shingles on a cat.

107
00:05:53,821 --> 00:05:56,321
     It's a terrible thing.

108
00:05:56,323 --> 00:05:58,924
     It is. If you've ever
had shingles, it's awful.

109
00:05:58,926 --> 00:06:00,826
        It sounds
     like it'd be fabulous.

110
00:06:00,828 --> 00:06:02,427
    Like, "You wearing
  your shingles to Gay Pride?"

111
00:06:02,429 --> 00:06:05,330
"Fucking bet I am, bitch.

112
00:06:05,332 --> 00:06:10,268
I'm gonna be covered in shingles
     and smelling of weed."

113
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:12,137
     But it's not like that
    at all, shingles.

114
00:06:12,139 --> 00:06:15,407
      It's like, "Oh, God!
Aah, it's so painful, shingles.

115
00:06:15,409 --> 00:06:17,209
     I hope cats get this."

116
00:06:18,845 --> 00:06:21,246
        [chuckles]

117
00:06:21,248 --> 00:06:23,548
But people get mad at you
  if you say your catchphrase.

118
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:25,417
    People get mad at you if
you don't say your catchphrase.

119
00:06:25,419 --> 00:06:27,219
People get mad at you if you do
    what I do for a living.

120
00:06:27,221 --> 00:06:29,287
    They just get mad at you
    if you just talk.

121
00:06:29,289 --> 00:06:31,757
I think people are mad at me on
the way to the fucking theater.

122
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:33,191
  I think people are offended

123
00:06:33,193 --> 00:06:34,860
    before they leave
    the fucking house.

124
00:06:34,862 --> 00:06:36,561
 "You ready to go to the show?"
             "Yep."

125
00:06:36,563 --> 00:06:40,732
      "Are you offended?"
"Fucking right, I am. Let's go."

126
00:06:44,203 --> 00:06:47,139
So, if people get offended
      at one of my shows,

127
00:06:47,141 --> 00:06:51,109
  I think, "What did you think
    was gonna happen?

128
00:06:51,111 --> 00:06:52,911
      "What did you think
    was gonna happen?

129
00:06:52,913 --> 00:06:56,047
        I mean, what"...
        [babbling]

130
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:01,787
Anyway, what I'm saying is

131
00:07:01,789 --> 00:07:03,288
      people get offended
         all the time.

132
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:05,157
Let me just apologize now,
    do you know what I mean?

133
00:07:05,159 --> 00:07:07,159
Let me just apolo--because
 before this night is through,

134
00:07:07,161 --> 00:07:10,429
I guarantee that each and every
  one of you will be offended

135
00:07:10,431 --> 00:07:12,464
    by something that I say.

136
00:07:12,466 --> 00:07:15,400
     [cheers and applause]

137
00:07:19,672 --> 00:07:23,975
    Save your applause until
it's your turn, all right?

138
00:07:23,977 --> 00:07:25,644
 Not that I'm gonna offend you,
        of course,

139
00:07:25,646 --> 00:07:27,646
because I happen to believe what
everyone in this room believes.

140
00:07:27,648 --> 00:07:29,748
 Craig, that's crazy. You can't
believe what everyone believes.

141
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:32,584
  I don't. I only believe what
everyone in this room believes.

142
00:07:32,586 --> 00:07:34,853
Everyone who's not here is
    a stupid asshole.

143
00:07:34,855 --> 00:07:36,288
          Am I right,
    everybody in this room?

144
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:39,458
     [cheers and applause]
            - Yeah!

145
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:42,127
     I'm not judging them.
     I'm just being honest.

146
00:07:42,129 --> 00:07:43,728
That's what you say, by the way,
    if you want to say

147
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:45,964
the worst shit you can think of
     and get away with it,

148
00:07:45,966 --> 00:07:47,365
 you just add to the sentence,

149
00:07:47,367 --> 00:07:49,100
    "I'm not judging.
    I'm just being honest."

150
00:07:49,102 --> 00:07:50,802
 Then you can say what the fuck
        you like.

151
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:52,771
      It is carte blanche,

152
00:07:52,773 --> 00:07:55,273
which is French for "white map."

153
00:07:55,275 --> 00:07:58,043
        It is white map.

154
00:07:58,045 --> 00:08:00,278
     It is white map to say
    whatever you want.

155
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,847
        I'm not judging.
     I'm just being honest.

156
00:08:01,849 --> 00:08:03,448
You can say what you like.

157
00:08:03,450 --> 00:08:05,183
        I'm not judging.
     I'm just being honest.

158
00:08:05,185 --> 00:08:06,818
          But your mom
gives terrible blow jobs.

159
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:10,522
        [laughter]

160
00:08:10,524 --> 00:08:12,324
Is that too much already?
        All right.

161
00:08:12,326 --> 00:08:13,959
We'll bring it back a bit.

162
00:08:13,961 --> 00:08:15,627
        I'm not judging.
     I'm just being honest.

163
00:08:15,629 --> 00:08:18,797
Your mom gives great blow jobs.

164
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:23,268
You know, when people get
  offended at one of my shows,

165
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:25,337
    I think, "What the fuck
did you think was gonna happen?

166
00:08:25,339 --> 00:08:28,139
 I mean, really, you come to a
tumbledown shit pit like this"--

167
00:08:28,141 --> 00:08:29,975
        I'm not judging.
     I'm just being honest.

168
00:08:29,977 --> 00:08:31,843
          "You come--

169
00:08:31,845 --> 00:08:35,080
"you come to a beautiful theater
        like this,

170
00:08:35,082 --> 00:08:38,583
    "stinking of weed,

171
00:08:38,585 --> 00:08:41,987
"to see a creepy foreigner
 that used to tell dirty jokes

172
00:08:41,989 --> 00:08:43,588
  "in the middle of the night
          on free TV.

173
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:48,693
  What the fuck did you think
    was gonna happen?"

174
00:08:48,695 --> 00:08:52,030
     [cheers and applause]

175
00:08:52,032 --> 00:08:53,798
         See, I think--

176
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:56,501
 I used to think that everybody
     came to a comedy show

177
00:08:56,503 --> 00:08:58,370
          for a laugh,
  and most people do, I think,

178
00:08:58,372 --> 00:09:00,372
  but there are some, there's
always some in every show

179
00:09:00,374 --> 00:09:02,340
  that are here for something
      better than a laugh.

180
00:09:02,342 --> 00:09:04,142
  They're about here tonight,
            I think.

181
00:09:04,144 --> 00:09:06,378
          They're here
     for something better,

182
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:08,980
        not for comedy,
 for something ever more fun--

183
00:09:08,982 --> 00:09:13,018
     the exquisite pleasure
of righteous indignation.

184
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:14,152
        [laughter]

185
00:09:14,154 --> 00:09:16,588
  Yes, that's not funny to me,

186
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:21,793
  because I'm morally superior
            to you.

187
00:09:21,795 --> 00:09:23,395
But let me put it to you,
     if everyone around you

188
00:09:23,397 --> 00:09:25,330
          is laughing
and you are not laughing,

189
00:09:25,332 --> 00:09:27,332
      perhaps you are not
    morally superior.

190
00:09:27,334 --> 00:09:30,569
      Perhaps you're just
    a miserable shit.

191
00:09:30,571 --> 00:09:33,204
          Not judging.

192
00:09:33,206 --> 00:09:34,806
It's not that you're not allowed
        to be offended.

193
00:09:34,808 --> 00:09:36,841
  Of course you are. You must
  talk about what offends you.

194
00:09:36,843 --> 00:09:38,577
    That's what I do.
 I talk about what offends me.

195
00:09:38,579 --> 00:09:40,612
    It's just that whatever,
you know, seems to offend

196
00:09:40,614 --> 00:09:42,547
    most people doesn't seem
      to bother me at all.

197
00:09:42,549 --> 00:09:45,183
 I'm not offended by, you know,
    what you believe.

198
00:09:45,185 --> 00:09:47,452
      I don't give a shit
  what your belief system is.

199
00:09:47,454 --> 00:09:50,956
     I mean, you're wrong,
  but I'm not offended by it.

200
00:09:53,159 --> 00:09:55,293
 I'm not offended if you think
     that magic underpants

201
00:09:55,295 --> 00:09:57,329
    are gonna put God
        in a good mood.

202
00:09:57,331 --> 00:10:00,966
         Good for you.

203
00:10:00,968 --> 00:10:03,435
        I'm not offended
          if you think

204
00:10:03,437 --> 00:10:06,771
 the magic Scientology machine
     will make you not gay.

205
00:10:06,773 --> 00:10:08,840
         Good for you.

206
00:10:11,377 --> 00:10:12,978
          Here's one.

207
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:16,781
 I'm not offended if you think
 the biscuit turns into Jesus.

208
00:10:16,783 --> 00:10:19,417
        [laughter]

209
00:10:19,419 --> 00:10:21,486
Ooh, remember how excited
            you were

210
00:10:21,488 --> 00:10:24,456
    about how offended
    you were gonna be?

211
00:10:24,458 --> 00:10:27,325
         Wait a minute.

212
00:10:27,327 --> 00:10:30,895
No, of course the biscuit
    turns into Jesus.

213
00:10:30,897 --> 00:10:34,165
        [laughter]

214
00:10:34,167 --> 00:10:37,869
Can I ask, when does the biscuit
        turn into Jesus?

215
00:10:37,871 --> 00:10:40,505
 Is it on the way to your mouth
      or does your saliva

216
00:10:40,507 --> 00:10:42,641
     activate the biscuit,
     turning it into Jesus?

217
00:10:42,643 --> 00:10:44,409
For example, could you go
    to a supermarket,

218
00:10:44,411 --> 00:10:45,944
 open up a packet of biscuits,
        and go...

219
00:10:45,946 --> 00:10:46,978
            [chomps]

220
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:49,848
             Jesus?

221
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:52,384
          Not judging.

222
00:10:52,386 --> 00:10:53,685
  No, none of that offends me.

223
00:10:53,687 --> 00:10:55,286
        I'm not offended
     by your belief system.

224
00:10:55,288 --> 00:10:56,988
     Believe what you want.
         I don't care.

225
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:59,257
  You know what offends me is
those bastards that walk around

226
00:10:59,259 --> 00:11:00,859
with shoes that look like feet.

227
00:11:00,861 --> 00:11:02,360
    Fuck those people!

228
00:11:02,362 --> 00:11:04,295
  Oh, my shoes look like feet.

229
00:11:04,297 --> 00:11:07,065
         Look at that!
             Oh-ho!

230
00:11:07,067 --> 00:11:08,767
My shoes, they look like--

231
00:11:08,769 --> 00:11:11,236
    It's like walking around
    in your bare feet.

232
00:11:11,238 --> 00:11:13,738
      Oh, that's amazing.
     That must be amazing.

233
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:16,675
What does that feel like?

234
00:11:19,812 --> 00:11:23,448
You want to impress me, you have
feet that look like shoes.

235
00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:26,384
        [laughter]

236
00:11:28,621 --> 00:11:32,390
That's a way to look smart
and save money at the same time.

237
00:11:32,392 --> 00:11:34,292
  Oh, my shoes look like feet.

238
00:11:34,294 --> 00:11:35,627
      You know the people
    I'm talking about.

239
00:11:35,629 --> 00:11:37,729
     The bastards that play
          Hacky Sack.

240
00:11:37,731 --> 00:11:39,297
         Hey, hey, hey!

241
00:11:39,299 --> 00:11:41,332
      That's another thing
  that offends me--Hacky Sack.

242
00:11:41,334 --> 00:11:43,535
      That is not a sport.
    That is not an activity.

243
00:11:43,537 --> 00:11:46,671
It's stoner foot juggling.

244
00:11:49,308 --> 00:11:52,143
    My shoes look like feet.

245
00:11:52,145 --> 00:11:53,778
  Actually, I want to tell you
        something.

246
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:55,947
I'll get on with the show
          in a minute.

247
00:11:55,949 --> 00:11:57,549
            I, um...

248
00:11:57,551 --> 00:12:00,351
         I'll be fine.
    It'll all cut together.

249
00:12:00,353 --> 00:12:02,253
  I was in Scotland recently,

250
00:12:02,255 --> 00:12:04,456
    and I was in a toy store
      with one of my kids.

251
00:12:04,458 --> 00:12:07,592
  I wasn't just hanging around
        in a toy store.

252
00:12:07,594 --> 00:12:08,893
            [laughs]

253
00:12:08,895 --> 00:12:12,330
      Hey, how you doing?

254
00:12:12,332 --> 00:12:14,966
         Like my shoes?
They look like feet, don't they?

255
00:12:14,968 --> 00:12:18,103
        [laughter]

256
00:12:19,905 --> 00:12:22,440
  I kind of creeped myself out
      there a little bit.

257
00:12:22,442 --> 00:12:24,909
    No, I was in a toy store
      with one of my kids,

258
00:12:24,911 --> 00:12:26,511
 and I saw that--in Scotland--

259
00:12:26,513 --> 00:12:29,114
    and I saw that they have
  Hacky Sack in Scotland now,

260
00:12:29,116 --> 00:12:30,749
  but they've changed the name
             of it

261
00:12:30,751 --> 00:12:31,983
 to make it sound more Scottish

262
00:12:31,985 --> 00:12:33,985
          to market it
    to a Scottish audience.

263
00:12:33,987 --> 00:12:35,587
 So it's not called Hacky Sack.

264
00:12:35,589 --> 00:12:39,224
          It's called,
 and I'm not kidding, footbag.

265
00:12:39,226 --> 00:12:42,327
        [laughter]

266
00:12:42,329 --> 00:12:44,496
            Footbag!

267
00:12:44,498 --> 00:12:47,732
  They have sucked all the joy
         and frivolity

268
00:12:47,734 --> 00:12:49,234
      out of the activity

269
00:12:49,236 --> 00:12:53,605
     and made it sound like
an unpleasant medical procedure.

270
00:12:53,607 --> 00:12:58,443
I'm afraid you're gonna have to
 have a footbag, Mr. Ferguson.

271
00:12:58,445 --> 00:13:01,379
            Footbag.
  Come on, let's play footbag

272
00:13:01,381 --> 00:13:04,783
with the amputated scrotum
    of an Englishman.

273
00:13:04,785 --> 00:13:07,352
          Ah, footbag.

274
00:13:07,354 --> 00:13:10,488
    [laughter and applause]

275
00:13:12,358 --> 00:13:14,125
            [laughs]

276
00:13:14,127 --> 00:13:15,927
Anyway, what I'm saying is
    I don't like the people

277
00:13:15,929 --> 00:13:17,896
    with the shoes that look
 like feet. I don't like that.

278
00:13:17,898 --> 00:13:19,330
      You know the people
    I'm talking about?

279
00:13:19,332 --> 00:13:20,999
    The people that have got
         prescriptions

280
00:13:21,001 --> 00:13:23,034
     for medical marijuana,
 but they don't really need it.

281
00:13:23,036 --> 00:13:26,371
        It's like,
  "Yeah, it's for my anxiety."

282
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:34,212
     "I get really anxious
    if I'm not high."

283
00:13:34,214 --> 00:13:36,581
 You know what? I don't want to
 even smoke marijuana anymore.

284
00:13:36,583 --> 00:13:38,650
I haven't smoke marijuana
    in over 20 years,

285
00:13:38,652 --> 00:13:43,154
    but at least when I did,
        it was illegal.

286
00:13:43,156 --> 00:13:46,591
      You fucking pussies!

287
00:13:46,593 --> 00:13:49,727
You don't have the decency
 to buy your recreational drugs

288
00:13:49,729 --> 00:13:52,263
from a dangerous criminal
in a truck stop bathroom.

289
00:13:52,265 --> 00:13:54,132
        Fuck you people!

290
00:13:54,134 --> 00:13:55,934
  Oh, my shoes look like feet.

291
00:13:55,936 --> 00:13:59,137
          Ah, ah, ah.

292
00:13:59,139 --> 00:14:00,772
    I don't like that whole

293
00:14:00,774 --> 00:14:03,007
 "things are like other things"
          way of life.

294
00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:04,509
        I don't like it.

295
00:14:04,511 --> 00:14:07,812
      You know, it's like,
    my shoes look like feet.

296
00:14:07,814 --> 00:14:10,081
         Oh, this tofu
    tastes like bacon.

297
00:14:10,083 --> 00:14:13,351
        No, it doesn't!
        No, it doesn't!

298
00:14:13,353 --> 00:14:16,521
      It tastes like feet.

299
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:21,492
    My shoes look like feet.
  This tofu tastes like bacon.

300
00:14:21,494 --> 00:14:25,196
This melon feels like a vagina.

301
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:28,366
 Actually, that--that is true.

302
00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:34,405
            [laughs]

303
00:14:34,407 --> 00:14:37,809
  Perhaps I've said too much.

304
00:14:37,811 --> 00:14:41,179
      What can I tell you?
  I was young. I was in love.

305
00:14:41,181 --> 00:14:44,048
         It was Paris.
    It was springtime.

306
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:46,451
     Melons were in season.

307
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:51,456
    We saw each other
over the produce counter.

308
00:14:57,096 --> 00:14:59,197
Here's a tip, by the way,
    if you are going to try

309
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:02,467
  the melon-vagina experiment.

310
00:15:02,469 --> 00:15:06,137
Please, allow the melon to reach
    room temperature first.

  with a freezing-cold melon.

    when I was a kid.

            [laughs]

460
00:21:07,133 --> 00:21:10,134
 "Baby, I can play your cooter
  like Kenny plays the tooter.

461
00:21:10,136 --> 00:21:12,637
            Mm-hmm."

462
00:21:12,639 --> 00:21:15,606
      ¶ Fadoodle, mm, uh

463
00:21:15,608 --> 00:21:19,210
        ¶ Fadoodle, mm

464
00:21:19,212 --> 00:21:22,046
        [laughter]

465
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:24,515
  I fully understand that 50%
    of the men in this room

466
00:21:24,517 --> 00:21:28,386
      have no fucking idea
what I'm doing right now.

467
00:21:28,388 --> 00:21:32,123
Like, "What the hell is he doing
        that fadoodling?

468
00:21:32,125 --> 00:21:36,127
That some kind of European shit?
         What is that?

469
00:21:36,129 --> 00:21:39,130
      Fadoodle doodling."

470
00:21:39,132 --> 00:21:41,198
 Of course, the real tragedy is
     about 10% of the women

471
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:44,268
          have no idea
     what I'm doing either.

472
00:21:44,270 --> 00:21:46,437
    "What is he doing?

473
00:21:46,439 --> 00:21:50,908
  "Why do I like that so much?

474
00:21:50,910 --> 00:21:53,444
      I just shit myself."

475
00:21:53,446 --> 00:21:57,948
        [laughter]

476
00:21:57,950 --> 00:22:00,384
 No, anyway, what I'm saying is
    Kenny G's performance--

477
00:22:00,386 --> 00:22:01,852
            [laughs]

478
00:22:01,854 --> 00:22:04,188
    Made myself laugh.
          That's good.

479
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:05,856
     Kenny G's performance
          was amazing.

480
00:22:05,858 --> 00:22:07,291
It was like he was there,
     but he was not there.

481
00:22:07,293 --> 00:22:08,726
         I'd never seen
    anything like it.

482
00:22:08,728 --> 00:22:10,461
        I think Kenny G
    could have sex with you

483
00:22:10,463 --> 00:22:11,862
  and you wouldn't even know.

484
00:22:11,864 --> 00:22:15,199
      Am I moving too fast
         for you, son?

485
00:22:15,201 --> 00:22:17,001
          I'm one guy.

486
00:22:17,003 --> 00:22:19,003
        Oh, Jesus,
  it's a middle-aged white guy

487
00:22:19,005 --> 00:22:22,139
         moving slowly
    from side to side.

488
00:22:23,809 --> 00:22:27,311
     You would be the worst
  prisoner of war guard ever.

489
00:22:29,147 --> 00:22:30,915
        [German accent]
    Vhere did zey go?

490
00:22:30,917 --> 00:22:34,085
         I don't know.
        Zey were moving.

491
00:22:34,087 --> 00:22:37,021
        [laughter]

492
00:22:42,394 --> 00:22:46,163
         [normal voice]
What I'm saying is Kenny G
    could have sex with you

493
00:22:46,165 --> 00:22:48,132
and you wouldn't even know
            Kenny G.

494
00:22:48,134 --> 00:22:49,533
        He's that good.

495
00:22:49,535 --> 00:22:51,369
You're just standing and talking
    to someone at the party,

496
00:22:51,371 --> 00:22:54,705
      like, "Mm-hmm, yes."
    Then it's like...

497
00:22:59,044 --> 00:23:02,646
"I think I've just been surprise
        finger-banged."

498
00:23:02,648 --> 00:23:05,816
      And you turn around,
  and Kenny'd be walking away.

499
00:23:05,818 --> 00:23:08,619
  ¶ Fadoodle doodle do do do

500
00:23:08,621 --> 00:23:11,756
     ¶ Fadoodle do-do-do

501
00:23:17,462 --> 00:23:20,264
        [laughter]

502
00:23:20,266 --> 00:23:23,768
 Oh, is that the edge? Have we
found the edge, New York?

503
00:23:23,770 --> 00:23:25,536
     No, Craig! No, please!

504
00:23:25,538 --> 00:23:29,673
     Don't pretend to smell
a pretend smell off your finger!

505
00:23:29,675 --> 00:23:32,810
        [laughter]

506
00:23:35,747 --> 00:23:36,947
            [sniffs]

507
00:23:36,949 --> 00:23:40,117
     [cheers and applause]

508
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:45,489
            [sniffs]

00:23:45,491 --> 00:23:48,492
             Melon.

510
00:23:48,494 --> 00:23:51,295
Anyway, much as I hate the music
     of Kenny G, and I do,

511
00:23:51,297 --> 00:23:54,331
  I much prefer it to the shit
that kids are listening to now,

512
00:23:54,333 --> 00:23:55,332
      all that kind of...

513
00:23:55,334 --> 00:23:57,334
         ¶ Whoa oh oh

514
00:23:57,336 --> 00:23:58,769
        ¶ Ooh ahh ahh

515
00:23:58,771 --> 00:24:01,172
    ¶ The lights...

516
00:24:01,174 --> 00:24:05,643
    ¶ There's lights ¶

517
00:24:05,645 --> 00:24:07,211
        ¶ Lights

518
00:24:07,213 --> 00:24:09,713
         ¶ The lights

519
00:24:09,715 --> 00:24:11,715
            ¶ Yeah

520
00:24:11,717 --> 00:24:15,286
     What the fuck is that?

521
00:24:15,288 --> 00:24:18,122
    That's not music.
      That's just a noise.

522
00:24:18,124 --> 00:24:20,458
  And then this, the dancing,
             the...

523
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:23,260
¶ Ah ah-ah ah ah-ah ah-ah
        ah-ah-ah ¶

524
00:24:23,262 --> 00:24:25,896
      The twerking, the...
        ¶ Ah ah-ah-ah

525
00:24:25,898 --> 00:24:27,932
      That's not a dance.
    That's not erotic.

526
00:24:27,934 --> 00:24:29,366
    That's like when the dog
        has worms,

527
00:24:29,368 --> 00:24:31,969
and he's trying to wipe his ass
         on the carpet.

528
00:24:31,971 --> 00:24:34,738
        ¶ Ah ah-ah-ah

529
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:36,407
    What's wrong with Miley?

530
00:24:36,409 --> 00:24:39,376
The poor kid's got worms,
 wiping her ass on the carpet.

531
00:24:41,446 --> 00:24:43,514
      I don't like the way
the dog holds eye contact

532
00:24:43,516 --> 00:24:44,715
     when he's doing that.

533
00:24:44,717 --> 00:24:47,084
            Ah. Oh.

534
00:24:47,086 --> 00:24:49,887
      Yeah, rou rike rat,
        don't you?

535
00:24:55,594 --> 00:24:58,762
  Now, look, I am fully aware

536
00:24:58,764 --> 00:25:00,664
    that attacking the music
        of young people

537
00:25:00,666 --> 00:25:01,866
    makes me an old geezer.

538
00:25:01,868 --> 00:25:04,068
         And it's true.
         I fucking am.

539
00:25:04,070 --> 00:25:06,604
     I'm 52 years old. 52.

540
00:25:06,606 --> 00:25:09,640
     [cheers and applause]
 - Stop! Don't. Don't. Do not.

541
00:25:09,642 --> 00:25:11,308
    That is very rude.

542
00:25:11,310 --> 00:25:16,213
 When somebody says their age,
 you go, "Oh, 52, still alive.

543
00:25:16,215 --> 00:25:18,883
  "Look at you walking around.

544
00:25:18,885 --> 00:25:21,352
    Did he shit his pants?"
    Only a little bit.

545
00:25:21,354 --> 00:25:24,154
        [laughter]

546
00:25:24,156 --> 00:25:26,824
I'm a member of the AARP.

547
00:25:26,826 --> 00:25:28,592
      I don't want to be.

548
00:25:28,594 --> 00:25:31,529
      I don't want to be.
  They just make you a member.

549
00:25:31,531 --> 00:25:33,330
    You turn 50, you are in.

550
00:25:33,332 --> 00:25:35,199
I'm like, "No, no, thanks.
      I don't want to be."

551
00:25:35,201 --> 00:25:37,968
They're like, "Yeah, you're in.
    Come on. Come on."

552
00:25:37,970 --> 00:25:40,604
      Actually, it starts
      when you're 49 1/2.

553
00:25:40,606 --> 00:25:42,206
 You come out in the mornings,

554
00:25:42,208 --> 00:25:44,875
  and you see on your driveway
little tennis ball marks.

555
00:25:44,877 --> 00:25:46,710
    They've been there
    during the night.

556
00:25:46,712 --> 00:25:49,480
        [groaning]

557
00:25:49,482 --> 00:25:52,449
             Soon.

558
00:25:55,587 --> 00:25:58,556
        One of us.
        One of us.

559
00:25:58,558 --> 00:26:02,526
        [laughter]

560
00:26:02,528 --> 00:26:05,162
Nothing against the AARP.
  They're a fine organization.

561
00:26:05,164 --> 00:26:06,564
They do a lot of good work
          for charity.

562
00:26:06,566 --> 00:26:08,198
    I just don't want to be
         in your club.

563
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:09,600
    I don't want to be
    in anybody's club.

564
00:26:09,602 --> 00:26:11,368
I particularly don't want to be
          in your club

565
00:26:11,370 --> 00:26:12,970
when the only requirement
         for membership

566
00:26:12,972 --> 00:26:15,906
      is starting to look
     like your own scrotum.

567
00:26:19,678 --> 00:26:21,745
      Did you ever see me
in that late-night show and go,

568
00:26:21,747 --> 00:26:23,180
    "I wonder what his balls
          look like"?

569
00:26:23,182 --> 00:26:25,649
             This.

570
00:26:25,651 --> 00:26:30,220
 Maybe a bit down on that side,
    but for the most part...

571
00:26:31,690 --> 00:26:33,123
        It's true.

572
00:26:33,125 --> 00:26:34,692
          For my next
  driver's license photograph,

573
00:26:34,694 --> 00:26:36,360
 I can just stick a camera down
        my pants,

574
00:26:36,362 --> 00:26:38,295
     photograph my scrotum,
and put it on the license.

575
00:26:38,297 --> 00:26:40,364
 And then when the cops pull me
     over, they'll be like,

576
00:26:40,366 --> 00:26:42,600
 "Hey, wait a minute. This was
 taken a while ago, wasn't it?"

577
00:26:42,602 --> 00:26:45,569
        [laughter]

578
00:26:47,672 --> 00:26:49,907
 I look at myself in the mirror
      sometimes, I'm like,

579
00:26:49,909 --> 00:26:52,409
"Why are my balls wearing a tie?
            Oh, no."

580
00:26:52,411 --> 00:26:56,246
        [laughter]

581
00:26:56,248 --> 00:26:59,483
        I have to shave
 like I shave down there now...

582
00:26:59,485 --> 00:27:01,552
        very carefully.

583
00:27:01,554 --> 00:27:03,454
I have to spread the skin
        and go like that

584
00:27:03,456 --> 00:27:05,489
      and spread the skin
    and go like that.

585
00:27:05,491 --> 00:27:08,125
        Do not judge me!

586
00:27:08,127 --> 00:27:11,662
     I have to shave there
 because of all the gray hair.

587
00:27:11,664 --> 00:27:16,634
If I don't, it looks like
  two prunes lost in the fog.

588
00:27:16,636 --> 00:27:20,604
        [laughter]

589
00:27:20,606 --> 00:27:21,805
      Actually, maybe not.

590
00:27:21,807 --> 00:27:23,440
 Maybe it looks like one little
         prune is lost,

591
00:27:23,442 --> 00:27:27,845
 and a big prune is helping him
        through the fog.

592
00:27:27,847 --> 00:27:29,013
            [laughs]

593
00:27:29,015 --> 00:27:30,447
      I'm scared, mister.

594
00:27:30,449 --> 00:27:33,283
    I'll get you there, son.
          Don't worry.

595
00:27:38,723 --> 00:27:41,692
 Anyway, I've thought of a way
of combating the aging process.

596
00:27:41,694 --> 00:27:43,260
     It's a fantastic idea.

597
00:27:43,262 --> 00:27:45,229
 I'm surprised no one's thought
         of it before.

598
00:27:45,231 --> 00:27:47,931
I'm gonna get a great deal
      of plastic surgery.

599
00:27:47,933 --> 00:27:49,366
        (audience)
              No!

600
00:27:49,368 --> 00:27:50,334
              Yes.

601
00:27:50,336 --> 00:27:52,269
        Yes, I am.
    I'm gonna get it.

602
00:27:52,271 --> 00:27:53,871
 People usually get very angry.

603
00:27:53,873 --> 00:27:56,740
 "No! We don't really mean it.
     We think you should."

604
00:27:56,742 --> 00:27:58,175
 People usually get very angry

605
00:27:58,177 --> 00:28:00,044
 when you say you're gonna get
        plastic surgery.

606
00:28:00,046 --> 00:28:01,679
         They're like,
      "Oh, come on, Craig.

607
00:28:01,681 --> 00:28:03,180
    "How can you be so vain?

608
00:28:03,182 --> 00:28:04,915
     How can you be so vain
    to get plastic surgery?"

609
00:28:04,917 --> 00:28:07,051
    I'm like, "I'm not vain.
I just want to look good."

610
00:28:07,053 --> 00:28:09,453
  You don't go up to somebody
  who's had a haircut and go,

611
00:28:09,455 --> 00:28:11,855
"How can you get your hair cut?
        You're so vain.

612
00:28:11,857 --> 00:28:13,624
    "Did you buy new pants?

613
00:28:13,626 --> 00:28:16,160
        You are so vain.
     I can't believe you."

614
00:28:16,162 --> 00:28:17,628
Actually, that's not true.

615
00:28:17,630 --> 00:28:19,530
      I get a bit of that
  when I go back to Scotland.

616
00:28:19,532 --> 00:28:22,099
    They're like, "Oh, aye,
      here he comes now--

617
00:28:22,101 --> 00:28:25,636
         Mr. 36 Teeth."

618
00:28:25,638 --> 00:28:28,038
        [laughter]

619
00:28:30,208 --> 00:28:31,709
 Everybody wants to look good.

620
00:28:31,711 --> 00:28:34,311
 The only people that genuinely
    don't give a shit

621
00:28:34,313 --> 00:28:37,514
      about how they look
  are, paradoxically, nudists.

622
00:28:37,516 --> 00:28:39,416
        [laughter]

623
00:28:39,418 --> 00:28:41,085
Which is weird, but they don't.

624
00:28:41,087 --> 00:28:43,053
  They're like, "Ah, fuck it,
     let's play volleyball.

625
00:28:43,055 --> 00:28:45,155
         "Ha ha! Yeah!

626
00:28:45,157 --> 00:28:48,525
      Come on, let's grill
        some sausages."

627
00:28:48,527 --> 00:28:51,795
  I went to a nude beach once
in Portugal. It was fan--

628
00:28:51,797 --> 00:28:54,998
         Well, I went--

629
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,400
      I was 23 years old.

630
00:28:56,402 --> 00:28:58,035
 I was on vacation in Portugal,

631
00:28:58,037 --> 00:29:00,237
      and I saw this sign
        for a nude beach

632
00:29:00,239 --> 00:29:01,705
     that said "nude beach"
         in Portuguese,

633
00:29:01,707 --> 00:29:03,907
  but I read Portuguese, so...

634
00:29:03,909 --> 00:29:05,109
                        (man)
                            Yay!

635
00:29:05,111 --> 00:29:06,810
            Thanks.

636
00:29:06,812 --> 00:29:09,680
    Thanks, gullible stoner
    in the second row.

637
00:29:09,682 --> 00:29:11,682
        [laughter]

638
00:29:11,684 --> 00:29:16,820
        Yeah, I'm high,
    and I'm also Portuguese.

639
00:29:16,822 --> 00:29:18,622
            Really?

640
00:29:18,624 --> 00:29:20,691
     Well, you'll know what
      the sign said, then.

641
00:29:20,693 --> 00:29:23,594
    It said, "nudo beacho."

642
00:29:25,764 --> 00:29:27,097
     Are you also a nudist?

643
00:29:27,099 --> 00:29:28,766
             - No.
          - Oh, okay.

644
00:29:28,768 --> 00:29:30,434
  'Cause I just like the idea
      of you sitting there

645
00:29:30,436 --> 00:29:32,102
    as a Portuguese nudist,
          and I said,

646
00:29:32,104 --> 00:29:33,771
"Everybody's gonna be offended."

647
00:29:33,773 --> 00:29:38,642
  And you thought to yourself,
      "Not me, my friend."

648
00:29:38,644 --> 00:29:40,244
         Anyway, I went
      to this nude beach,

649
00:29:40,246 --> 00:29:42,112
        'cause I thought
    it'd be fantastic.

650
00:29:42,114 --> 00:29:44,248
 I thought, well, it'll be full
 of beautiful, young Portuguese

651
00:29:44,250 --> 00:29:46,049
  and Spanish and French women
          all saying,

652
00:29:46,051 --> 00:29:50,154
        "Craig, help us
     put suntan lotion on.

653
00:29:50,156 --> 00:29:54,758
     Use your thumb, Craig.
         Do anything."

654
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:56,426
  But there are no beautiful,
          young people

655
00:29:56,428 --> 00:29:58,529
on the naked beaches of Europe.

656
00:29:58,531 --> 00:30:02,199
Save your vacation dollar.

657
00:30:02,201 --> 00:30:04,868
    There's only Germans...

658
00:30:04,870 --> 00:30:07,371
        [laughter]

659
00:30:07,373 --> 00:30:11,742
    Overweight Germans
    of indeterminate gender.

660
00:30:11,744 --> 00:30:14,511
You can't tell--Even when
     the volleyball starts,

661
00:30:14,513 --> 00:30:16,146
  you're like, "Oh, oh, nope.

662
00:30:16,148 --> 00:30:18,115
      Could go either way.
         I don't know."

663
00:30:21,085 --> 00:30:22,886
 Germans walking up and down...

664
00:30:22,888 --> 00:30:26,156
        [German accent]
  "Mm, I love to feel the sun
    on my pleasure organs."

665
00:30:26,158 --> 00:30:27,891
        [laughter]

666
00:30:27,893 --> 00:30:30,327
      "Oh, look, a shell."

667
00:30:32,897 --> 00:30:36,166
         [normal voice]
     There's your first-row
ticket price right there, lady.

668
00:30:39,304 --> 00:30:40,838
  You know, people say to me,

669
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:42,940
 "Craig, why do you always use
        a German accent

670
00:30:42,942 --> 00:30:44,241
  to imply sexual perversion?"

671
00:30:44,243 --> 00:30:46,109
         Well, there's
      two reasons, really.

672
00:30:46,111 --> 00:30:49,279
      One, come on, and...

673
00:30:49,281 --> 00:30:50,848
     Nah, it's a ridiculous
          stereotype.

674
00:30:50,850 --> 00:30:52,783
  I know it is, but it's just
      because of something

675
00:30:52,785 --> 00:30:54,518
      that happened to me
    at a pivotal age.

676
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:56,453
         I was, like--
Actually, it's a New York story.

677
00:30:56,455 --> 00:30:58,755
     It's the first time--
     I met a German person

678
00:30:58,757 --> 00:31:01,225
     the first time I came
    to New York as an adult.

679
00:31:01,227 --> 00:31:02,759
          It was 1983,

680
00:31:02,761 --> 00:31:04,761
and it was the first time
 I had come here unsupervised.

681
00:31:04,763 --> 00:31:07,965
  1983, a flight from Glasgow
     to Newark, New Jersey.

682
00:31:07,967 --> 00:31:09,800
    And there I took a bus.
I didn't have much money.

683
00:31:09,802 --> 00:31:12,336
     Took a bus from Newark
     right into 42nd Street

684
00:31:12,338 --> 00:31:14,338
  Port Authority Bus Station.

685
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:16,340
     And I was so excited.
    It was fantastic.

686
00:31:16,342 --> 00:31:18,075
          It was like,
 "Oh, I'm so happy to be in...

687
00:31:18,077 --> 00:31:19,910
         "¶ New York

688
00:31:19,912 --> 00:31:22,379
    "¶ New York, New York

689
00:31:22,381 --> 00:31:25,082
  "¶ Who will be my friend?

690
00:31:25,084 --> 00:31:28,318
    ¶ This is so exciting "

691
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:31,622
  I had a little sailor outfit
        and everything.

692
00:31:31,624 --> 00:31:34,391
Now, this is Manhattan in 1983.

693
00:31:34,393 --> 00:31:35,726
      Now it's different.

694
00:31:35,728 --> 00:31:37,527
         Now it's like
      fucking Disneyland.

695
00:31:37,529 --> 00:31:39,296
            You guys
will all be fine tonight.

696
00:31:39,298 --> 00:31:41,732
  You'll be able to get home.
Nobody'll kill ya, maybe, but...

697
00:31:41,734 --> 00:31:43,066
        [mumbles]

698
00:31:43,068 --> 00:31:45,068
 Nobody's looking at any danger
        on the way home,

699
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:48,105
  but in 1983, it wasn't like
    Disneyland around here.

700
00:31:48,107 --> 00:31:50,507
      It was like fucking
   <i>Game of Thrones</i> out there.

701
00:31:50,509 --> 00:31:52,576
    [laughter and applause]

702
00:31:52,578 --> 00:31:54,278
      It's very different.

703
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:56,280
              Ah!

704
00:31:56,282 --> 00:31:59,383
             Ha ha!

705
00:31:59,385 --> 00:32:03,020
  It was wild, and I got out--

706
00:32:03,022 --> 00:32:05,722
      I was 19. I got out
 at Port Authority Bus Station,

707
00:32:05,724 --> 00:32:07,958
  I was out, and it was, like,
        42nd Street 1983

708
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:10,794
all the way down one side,
all the way down the other side,

709
00:32:10,796 --> 00:32:11,895
          peep shows.

710
00:32:11,897 --> 00:32:14,031
     That's all there were,
          peep shows.

711
00:32:14,033 --> 00:32:16,233
 I didn't know what they were,
'cause we didn't have peep shows

712
00:32:16,235 --> 00:32:17,668
          in Scotland.

713
00:32:17,670 --> 00:32:21,405
          It's illegal
  to even think about peeping.

714
00:32:21,407 --> 00:32:22,606
 I didn't know what they were.

715
00:32:22,608 --> 00:32:24,708
    I thought they might be
        something dirty,

716
00:32:24,710 --> 00:32:26,710
because they had this, you know,
     the kind of silhouette

717
00:32:26,712 --> 00:32:28,412
of the lady outside, like that.

718
00:32:28,414 --> 00:32:30,047
        I thought, "Ooh,
  it's either something dirty,

719
00:32:30,049 --> 00:32:32,349
"or it's where truckers go
    to get their mud flaps.

720
00:32:32,351 --> 00:32:34,651
      Either way, I'm in."

721
00:32:34,653 --> 00:32:36,453
         So I thought,
  "I'll go to this peep show."

722
00:32:36,455 --> 00:32:38,088
          So I run up
    to the first peep show,

723
00:32:38,090 --> 00:32:39,890
and there's a guy sitting
on a stool outside of it.

724
00:32:39,892 --> 00:32:42,659
He's got one arm, and his sleeve
    is taped to his jacket.

725
00:32:42,661 --> 00:32:45,629
     He's got an eye patch
 and a parrot and a hook and--

726
00:32:45,631 --> 00:32:47,965
      And he's like, "Ah!"

727
00:32:47,967 --> 00:32:50,233
It was like, "Hey, mister,
I want to go to the peep show."

728
00:32:50,235 --> 00:32:53,303
 I had the hat with the little
propeller on it and everything.

729
00:32:53,305 --> 00:32:56,440
        [laughter]

730
00:32:56,442 --> 00:32:57,874
      Now, let me explain.

731
00:32:57,876 --> 00:32:59,710
    If you don't understand
     what a peep show is--

732
00:32:59,712 --> 00:33:01,812
  Some of you are too young to
understand what a peep show is.

733
00:33:01,814 --> 00:33:03,347
        Let me explain.

734
00:33:03,349 --> 00:33:06,650
         A peep show--
      before the Internet,

735
00:33:06,652 --> 00:33:09,653
      people had to forage
        for their porn.

736
00:33:09,655 --> 00:33:13,657
      Back then, perverts
     were hunter-gatherers,

737
00:33:13,659 --> 00:33:16,626
going from place to place.

738
00:33:19,530 --> 00:33:21,264
         A peep show--
        it was amazing.

739
00:33:21,266 --> 00:33:22,933
 You're in this peep show, and
 you put a quarter into a slot,

740
00:33:22,935 --> 00:33:24,634
    and a little letter box,
  a little kind of mail thing,

741
00:33:24,636 --> 00:33:26,970
    mailbox thing opened up,
     and inside was a room,

742
00:33:26,972 --> 00:33:29,006
  and this room was an angry,
        middle-aged lady

743
00:33:29,008 --> 00:33:30,707
    in her underwear,
      smoking a cigarette,

744
00:33:30,709 --> 00:33:32,242
     saying, "What the fuck
        you looking at?"

745
00:33:32,244 --> 00:33:34,277
  Then is slipped down again.

746
00:33:34,279 --> 00:33:38,648
  It was the most erotic thing
I'd ever seen in my life!

747
00:33:41,352 --> 00:33:42,686
 I, like, put all my money in.

748
00:33:42,688 --> 00:33:45,022
        [groaning]

749
00:33:45,024 --> 00:33:46,757
    Anyway, that's not
    the German thing.

750
00:33:46,759 --> 00:33:49,393
What happened was I was--

751
00:33:49,395 --> 00:33:51,695
        I was in there,
and I ran out of quarters,

752
00:33:51,697 --> 00:33:53,163
and I thought, "I'm gonna
have to make friends here.

753
00:33:53,165 --> 00:33:55,132
I can't stay here all day,
      much as I want to."

754
00:33:55,134 --> 00:33:57,267
     So I started to panic,
    'cause I thought,

755
00:33:57,269 --> 00:33:59,269
"I don't know how to make
     friends in this town."

756
00:33:59,271 --> 00:34:01,438
 Then I thought, "Well, do what
    you would do in Glasgow.

757
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:04,541
"Glasgow's a working-class town.
    I'm a working-class man.

758
00:34:04,543 --> 00:34:06,376
 "What would you do in Glasgow
        to meet people?

759
00:34:06,378 --> 00:34:08,078
 I'd go to a workingman's bar."

760
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:11,381
  So I looked down 42nd Street
in 1983 for a workingman's bar,

761
00:34:11,383 --> 00:34:13,350
         and I see one.

762
00:34:13,352 --> 00:34:15,786
 I can tell it's a workingman's
 bar, cops are going in there.

763
00:34:15,788 --> 00:34:18,722
      Construction workers
      are going in there.

764
00:34:18,724 --> 00:34:22,859
     Some Native Americans
      are going in there.

765
00:34:22,861 --> 00:34:25,896
 I didn't even know there were
tribes left in Manhattan.

766
00:34:25,898 --> 00:34:28,799
         This is great.

767
00:34:30,802 --> 00:34:32,836
 And I went in this bar. It was
very dark, and it was all guys.

768
00:34:32,838 --> 00:34:34,671
        I thought,
"Well, where are the women at?"

769
00:34:34,673 --> 00:34:36,773
And then I looked over, and all
the women were over there.

770
00:34:36,775 --> 00:34:38,041
I said, "Good evening, ladies."
        They're like...

771
00:34:38,043 --> 00:34:39,910
          [deep voice]
    "Hey, what's up?"

772
00:34:39,912 --> 00:34:42,913
        And then--

773
00:34:42,915 --> 00:34:44,414
          I was like,
      "Oh, it's a gay bar.

774
00:34:44,416 --> 00:34:46,249
    "All right, well, okay,

775
00:34:46,251 --> 00:34:49,286
  "I'll just finish my drink,
which I'm about to order,

776
00:34:49,288 --> 00:34:51,655
     and then I'll leave."

777
00:34:51,657 --> 00:34:54,858
I was wearing my sailor outfit.
        I looked great.

778
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:56,426
  I was sitting up at the bar,

779
00:34:56,428 --> 00:34:59,096
  and this guy came up to me,
         and he said...

780
00:34:59,098 --> 00:35:00,197
        [German accent]
            "Hello."

781
00:35:00,199 --> 00:35:03,100
        I said, "Hello."

782
00:35:03,102 --> 00:35:05,502
    He said, "I am German."

783
00:35:05,504 --> 00:35:09,005
        I said, "I know.
I can tell from your hat."

784
00:35:09,007 --> 00:35:10,807
     'Cause he was wearing,
      and I'm not kidding,

785
00:35:10,809 --> 00:35:14,211
         a leather hat
 with a spike coming out of it.

786
00:35:14,213 --> 00:35:17,447
 I was like, "Too soon, girl."

787
00:35:17,449 --> 00:35:20,550
        [laughter]

788
00:35:20,552 --> 00:35:23,787
          So he said,
"Can I ask you something?"

789
00:35:23,789 --> 00:35:26,556
  And I said, "Sure," and then
he said the dirtiest thing

790
00:35:26,558 --> 00:35:28,391
  I've ever heard in my life,
        before or since.

791
00:35:28,393 --> 00:35:29,793
Now, don't get mad at me,

792
00:35:29,795 --> 00:35:31,328
      'cause this is what
    he actually said, right?

793
00:35:31,330 --> 00:35:32,562
      I'm just reporting.

794
00:35:32,564 --> 00:35:35,832
 He said--he said, and I quote,

795
00:35:35,834 --> 00:35:37,801
"Can I ask you something?"
         I said, "Yes."

796
00:35:37,803 --> 00:35:40,737
    He said, "Can I kiss you
        where it stinks,

797
00:35:40,739 --> 00:35:44,241
  <i>und</i> I don't mean Cleveland."

798
00:35:44,243 --> 00:35:45,542
    And I was like...

799
00:35:57,054 --> 00:35:59,689
             "What?

800
00:35:59,691 --> 00:36:02,826
    Who's Cleveland?"

801
00:36:02,828 --> 00:36:04,194
Anyway, he's a lovely man.

802
00:36:04,196 --> 00:36:06,196
    We still keep in touch,
        but that's why--

803
00:36:06,198 --> 00:36:08,598
Christmas cards and stuff.

804
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:10,500
    That's why I think
      of the German thing.

805
00:36:10,502 --> 00:36:12,802
  That's not the point. I was
 talking about plastic surgery.

806
00:36:12,804 --> 00:36:14,204
 And I'm gonna get a lot of it.

807
00:36:14,206 --> 00:36:16,006
    Now, the thing is,
about plastic surgery is,

808
00:36:16,008 --> 00:36:17,874
      you have to get good
        plastic surgery,

809
00:36:17,876 --> 00:36:19,943
     'cause if you get bad
        plastic surgery,

810
00:36:19,945 --> 00:36:21,845
you look like the dog with
  his head out the car window.

811
00:36:21,847 --> 00:36:23,547
        You have to have
     good plastic surgery.

812
00:36:23,549 --> 00:36:25,348
  Now, I live in Los Angeles,

813
00:36:25,350 --> 00:36:27,050
        which has a lot
      of plastic surgeons,

814
00:36:27,052 --> 00:36:29,219
but not very many of them
 are any good, and these guys--

815
00:36:29,221 --> 00:36:31,254
There's only about four of them,
  I think, that are any good.

816
00:36:31,256 --> 00:36:33,657
 And they're not just doctors.
    They're like sculptors.

817
00:36:33,659 --> 00:36:35,358
    They have a style.
    They have a look.

818
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:38,461
 So what happens is that people
     start looking similar.

819
00:36:38,463 --> 00:36:40,197
 People start looking related.

820
00:36:40,199 --> 00:36:41,698
        I'm telling you,
    you go to Beverly Hills

821
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:43,400
    at any time of the day,

822
00:36:43,402 --> 00:36:46,269
it looks like there's only
 four families that live there.

823
00:36:46,271 --> 00:36:49,539
And people start looking related
 from different ethnic groups.

824
00:36:49,541 --> 00:36:51,741
  They look like they could--
     I mean, it's amazing.

825
00:36:51,743 --> 00:36:53,843
        I'm like, "Wow."
I've seen this with my own eyes.

826
00:36:53,845 --> 00:36:56,346
     Cher and Bruce Jenner
    could be sisters.

827
00:36:56,348 --> 00:36:59,816
    [audience groans]

828
00:36:59,818 --> 00:37:01,718
 Anyway, I thought it was just
    a Hollywood rumor,

829
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:03,320
         'cause I hear
  all these Hollywood rumors,

830
00:37:03,322 --> 00:37:05,121
 and they're usually bullshit,
        you know.

831
00:37:05,123 --> 00:37:07,224
  I mean, 'cause I meet these
    people, and I go,

832
00:37:07,226 --> 00:37:08,725
     "Oh, that's bullshit."

833
00:37:08,727 --> 00:37:10,427
 Like, the rumor that I'd heard
          for years--

834
00:37:10,429 --> 00:37:14,064
 For years, I'd heard the rumor
      about Richard Gere,

835
00:37:14,066 --> 00:37:14,898
    the actor, Richard Gere.

836
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:16,399
 Did you ever hear that rumor?

837
00:37:16,401 --> 00:37:18,368
     I mean, this predates
the Internet, this rumor.

838
00:37:18,370 --> 00:37:21,438
 Yeah, I think it was a German
    guy in a bar in New York

839
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:23,006
         told me this.

840
00:37:23,008 --> 00:37:24,641
        For years,
  this rumor was going around

841
00:37:24,643 --> 00:37:26,810
        that apparently,
      for sexual pleasure,

842
00:37:26,812 --> 00:37:29,879
Richard Gere put a gerbil
    or a hamster in his ass,

843
00:37:29,881 --> 00:37:32,048
      you know, for sex--
    for his sexual pleasure,

844
00:37:32,050 --> 00:37:35,085
not the--I don't think the
rodent gets anything out of it.

845
00:37:35,087 --> 00:37:38,255
      Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah!

846
00:37:38,257 --> 00:37:40,257
        Oh, yeah!

847
00:37:40,259 --> 00:37:42,392
             Yeah!

848
00:37:42,394 --> 00:37:44,594
        [applause]

849
00:37:44,596 --> 00:37:46,463
              No.

850
00:37:46,465 --> 00:37:47,697
     No, this is the rumor

851
00:37:47,699 --> 00:37:49,766
        that apparently
     the actor Richard Gere

852
00:37:49,768 --> 00:37:51,635
     would put this stuff--
And I never questioned it.

853
00:37:51,637 --> 00:37:53,169
          I just went,
    "Oh, I didn't know that.

854
00:37:53,171 --> 00:37:54,838
Oh, gosh, people are so strange,
         aren't they?"

855
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:57,240
And then I meet the actor
         Richard Gere,

856
00:37:57,242 --> 00:38:00,810
  and it's in my fucking head
when I'm shaking the man's hand.

857
00:38:00,812 --> 00:38:03,480
    I'm thinking, "I wonder
      if he has a rodent--

858
00:38:03,482 --> 00:38:06,916
 No! Of course he doesn't have
     a rodent in his ass!"

859
00:38:06,918 --> 00:38:10,353
    I'm talking to this guy.
I don't even think he has a pet.

860
00:38:10,355 --> 00:38:13,290
        [laughter]

861
00:38:14,792 --> 00:38:17,193
At least I didn't see one.

862
00:38:20,631 --> 00:38:22,666
      Come to think of it,
     I might have heard...

863
00:38:22,668 --> 00:38:25,335
      [high-pitched voice]
        "Help me.

864
00:38:25,337 --> 00:38:27,537
         Send cheese."

865
00:38:30,074 --> 00:38:31,741
 I'll tell you what does happen
         in Hollywood,

866
00:38:31,743 --> 00:38:33,176
 if you're there for any length
        of time, though.

867
00:38:33,178 --> 00:38:34,911
     What happened to me--
     a very strange thing,

868
00:38:34,913 --> 00:38:36,846
  is that you will eventually
          meet someone

869
00:38:36,848 --> 00:38:38,948
     who was a hero to you
     when you were a child,

870
00:38:38,950 --> 00:38:40,817
and that is very, very strange.

871
00:38:40,819 --> 00:38:42,719
     Now, it happened to me
      just very early on.

872
00:38:42,721 --> 00:38:44,154
      I'd only been there
        about 18 months,

873
00:38:44,156 --> 00:38:45,889
    and I was working
    on <i>The Drew Carey Show.</i>

874
00:38:45,891 --> 00:38:47,557
    You guys remember
      <i>The Drew Carey Show?</i>

875
00:38:47,559 --> 00:38:48,958
     [cheers and applause]
            - Right.

876
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:50,960
      <i>The Drew Carey Show,</i>
        if you remember,

877
00:38:50,962 --> 00:38:53,129
    it was basically--
you know, most of the time

878
00:38:53,131 --> 00:38:54,964
        it was just Drew
    and Kathy Kinney,

879
00:38:54,966 --> 00:38:57,100
  the actress who played Mimi,
and they would, you know,

880
00:38:57,102 --> 00:38:58,968
 fight each other, and I played
  the English boss, Mr. Wick.

881
00:38:58,970 --> 00:39:01,237
    And I'd come in and go,
     "Carey, you're fired,"

882
00:39:01,239 --> 00:39:04,874
    once a week, and then--
then I'd go to my trailer

883
00:39:04,876 --> 00:39:08,278
     and play with fruit...

884
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:10,046
        [laughter]

885
00:39:10,048 --> 00:39:11,514
          For a week.

886
00:39:11,516 --> 00:39:14,150
So I was bored. They were
 nice people, but I was bored.

887
00:39:14,152 --> 00:39:16,152
     So what I did in order
    to pass the time--

888
00:39:16,154 --> 00:39:19,089
 We made <i>The Drew Carey Show</i> on
the Warner Brothers Studio lot,

889
00:39:19,091 --> 00:39:21,024
  which is a huge studio lot.
  They make everything there.

890
00:39:21,026 --> 00:39:22,592
 You know, movies and TV shows,
          everything.

891
00:39:22,594 --> 00:39:25,495
  So what I did was I started
    reading the screenplays,

892
00:39:25,497 --> 00:39:27,564
the scripts to movies that were
in production at the time.

893
00:39:27,566 --> 00:39:30,033
You know, just to pass the time.
  This is about 18 years ago.

894
00:39:30,035 --> 00:39:33,570
 And it was a very interesting
point, I read a screenplay

895
00:39:33,572 --> 00:39:35,138
to a movie called <i>Twister.</i>

896
00:39:35,140 --> 00:39:36,940
    You guys remember
      that movie <i>Twister,</i>

897
00:39:36,942 --> 00:39:41,277
about the tornado and the cows,
     like, "Ooh, tornado"?

898
00:39:41,279 --> 00:39:44,714
 Well, it was very interesting
 'cause the script was rubbish,

899
00:39:44,716 --> 00:39:47,117
    but the movie was shit.

900
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:51,221
        [laughter]

901
00:39:51,223 --> 00:39:53,490
So I thought, "Well, that's what
I'll do to pass the time.

902
00:39:53,492 --> 00:39:55,091
    "I'll write screenplays.

903
00:39:55,093 --> 00:39:56,426
  "I don't know if I can write
      any better than this

904
00:39:56,428 --> 00:39:57,927
        "but it's
scientifically impossible

905
00:39:57,929 --> 00:39:59,362
to write anything worse."

906
00:39:59,364 --> 00:40:01,164
  So I wrote some screenplays,
    and they did okay,

907
00:40:01,166 --> 00:40:02,599
 and we made them into movies,

908
00:40:02,601 --> 00:40:04,100
     and one of the movies
        did really well,

909
00:40:04,102 --> 00:40:05,568
    And this is where
you meet your hero thing.

910
00:40:05,570 --> 00:40:07,404
 There was a movie I did called
          <i>Saving Grace,</i>

911
00:40:07,406 --> 00:40:09,139
     and it did very well.

912
00:40:09,141 --> 00:40:12,909
  Good movie, did well, we won
  the Sundance Film Festival.

913
00:40:12,911 --> 00:40:14,444
    It made a little money.

914
00:40:14,446 --> 00:40:16,679
    And after it had been in
the theaters for about a month,

915
00:40:16,681 --> 00:40:19,883
I got a phone call from a lovely
upper-class Englishwoman,

916
00:40:19,885 --> 00:40:23,052
        who said,
  "Hello, my name's Victoria."

917
00:40:23,054 --> 00:40:26,523
And I was like, ooh, half chub.

918
00:40:26,525 --> 00:40:28,992
        [laughter]

919
00:40:28,994 --> 00:40:30,693
    I've always had a thing
  for upper-class Englishwomen

920
00:40:30,695 --> 00:40:32,262
They really do it for me.

921
00:40:32,264 --> 00:40:34,397
  I always enjoy doing to them
    what their ancestors did

922
00:40:34,399 --> 00:40:36,466
    to my ancestors...

923
00:40:36,468 --> 00:40:39,803
     but with more kissing.

924
00:40:39,805 --> 00:40:41,738
So this lovely woman said,
  "Hello, my name's Victoria.

925
00:40:41,740 --> 00:40:43,239
    I loved your film
         <i>Saving Grace."</i>

926
00:40:43,241 --> 00:40:45,141
          It was like,
     "Thank you very much."

927
00:40:45,143 --> 00:40:48,611
     She said, "Yes, I run
  Mick Jagger's film company."

928
00:40:48,613 --> 00:40:51,214
          Mick Jagger!
        Yes, it's true.

929
00:40:51,216 --> 00:40:53,016
          Mick Jagger,
my hero when I was a kid.

930
00:40:53,018 --> 00:40:55,452
I had an 8-foot poster of
 Mick Jagger on my bedroom wall

931
00:40:55,454 --> 00:40:59,789
  for years, you know, the one
    where he's like...

932
00:40:59,791 --> 00:41:01,825
          Mick Jagger!
      It was like, "What?"

933
00:41:01,827 --> 00:41:04,327
        She said,
"Yes, Mick loved your film too."

934
00:41:04,329 --> 00:41:06,095
I was like, "Oh, that's great."
        She went, "Yes.

935
00:41:06,097 --> 00:41:08,431
 "Actually, Mick's had an idea
          for a movie,

936
00:41:08,433 --> 00:41:10,667
  "and he thinks you might be
        the right person

937
00:41:10,669 --> 00:41:12,268
"to write the screenplay.

938
00:41:12,270 --> 00:41:15,538
    He was wondering,
    may he call you?"

939
00:41:15,540 --> 00:41:17,874
        I said...

940
00:41:17,876 --> 00:41:20,109
             "Yes.

941
00:41:20,111 --> 00:41:22,178
     Yes, he may call me."

942
00:41:22,180 --> 00:41:23,947
              So--
This is all true, I swear.

943
00:41:23,949 --> 00:41:25,782
     So we set the time up,
    and a couple days later,

944
00:41:25,784 --> 00:41:28,051
I'm waiting by the phone.
 I'm nervous, and I'm kind of--

945
00:41:28,053 --> 00:41:30,286
        And Mick Jagger
    called me himself.

946
00:41:30,288 --> 00:41:32,622
  And that's not easy for him
  to do with the little hands,

947
00:41:32,624 --> 00:41:34,991
         but he did it.

948
00:41:36,894 --> 00:41:38,828
  And I tried to break the ice
          with a joke.

949
00:41:38,830 --> 00:41:40,396
 It was a stupid thing to say,
          but I said,

950
00:41:40,398 --> 00:41:43,666
"Hello, Mick. Victoria tells me
    you're a singer."

951
00:41:43,668 --> 00:41:47,637
        [laughter]

952
00:41:47,639 --> 00:41:50,573
     And he kind of went...
            [groans]

953
00:41:50,575 --> 00:41:52,775
          I was like,
 "Oh, I'm blowing it already."

954
00:41:52,777 --> 00:41:54,277
    And then he said,

955
00:41:54,279 --> 00:41:56,079
"All right, well, I've had
      an idea for a film."

956
00:41:56,081 --> 00:41:57,614
    I was like, "Oh, what?"

957
00:41:57,616 --> 00:41:59,682
And he went, "Well, here's
      my idea, all right?"

958
00:41:59,684 --> 00:42:03,419
      I was like, "Okay."

959
00:42:03,421 --> 00:42:08,324
I think he was doing that.
    I could sort of hear it.

960
00:42:08,326 --> 00:42:11,528
He went, "Yeah, I've got an idea
    for a film, here it is.

961
00:42:11,530 --> 00:42:14,531
          "What it is,
is it's about a rock star

962
00:42:14,533 --> 00:42:16,466
         "and a roadie.

963
00:42:16,468 --> 00:42:18,568
     "And what happens is,
        for some reason,

964
00:42:18,570 --> 00:42:20,370
"they have to swap places,

965
00:42:20,372 --> 00:42:24,173
    and then they have
         an adventure."

966
00:42:30,714 --> 00:42:33,783
      I was like, "Go on."

967
00:42:33,785 --> 00:42:35,618
    And he did. He went on,
  and he described the story,

968
00:42:35,620 --> 00:42:37,687
which as I was listening to it,
        I realized that

969
00:42:37,689 --> 00:42:41,424
  he was saying beat for beat,
     almost word for word,

970
00:42:41,426 --> 00:42:43,426
        the story
 of <i>The Prince and the Pauper,</i>

971
00:42:43,428 --> 00:42:46,629
     written by Mark Twain
  about 150 years previously.

972
00:42:46,631 --> 00:42:47,964
 What the fuck am I gonna say?

973
00:42:47,966 --> 00:42:51,467
    It's Mick Jagger,
    my childhood hero.

974
00:42:51,469 --> 00:42:52,702
      What am I gonna say?

975
00:42:52,704 --> 00:42:54,304
     Look, if Sean Connery
     calls me up and says,

976
00:42:54,306 --> 00:42:55,972
    "Craig, I've got an idea
          for a film.

977
00:42:55,974 --> 00:42:57,607
 "It's called <i>Treasure Island.</i>

978
00:42:57,609 --> 00:43:00,143
  "It's about a pirate called
    Long Sean Connery.

979
00:43:00,145 --> 00:43:02,245
  He's got a parrot and shit."

980
00:43:02,247 --> 00:43:04,981
          I'd be like,
"Great idea, Sean Connery.

981
00:43:04,983 --> 00:43:08,585
How did you come up with that?"

982
00:43:08,587 --> 00:43:12,989
"Well, I was just watching
  a movie, and it came to me."

983
00:43:14,425 --> 00:43:16,826
    Anyway, so Mick Jagger--
         This is true.

984
00:43:16,828 --> 00:43:18,795
     Mick Jagger's talking
     about his movie idea,

985
00:43:18,797 --> 00:43:20,563
          and I pitch
     a couple of ideas in.

986
00:43:20,565 --> 00:43:22,332
 And he says--I'm not kidding.
     This really happened.

987
00:43:22,334 --> 00:43:24,200
He goes, "Actually, I think you
      are the right person

988
00:43:24,202 --> 00:43:25,902
"to write the screenplay.

989
00:43:25,904 --> 00:43:28,738
"Can you meet me next Wednesday
     and we'll get started?

990
00:43:28,740 --> 00:43:31,808
"You know, we'll spitball
 and get ideas going and stuff

991
00:43:31,810 --> 00:43:33,209
        and get going."

992
00:43:33,211 --> 00:43:34,944
    I was like, "Yes."
      He went, "All right.

993
00:43:34,946 --> 00:43:36,813
Victoria will set it up,"
        and he hangs up.

994
00:43:36,815 --> 00:43:38,448
Now, this is about 17 years ago.

995
00:43:38,450 --> 00:43:41,918
     It's not easy for him
    to do that either.

996
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:44,687
  And it's about 17 years ago,
     and The Rolling Stones

997
00:43:44,689 --> 00:43:46,856
    at the time are on
  the <i>Bridges to Babylon</i> tour.

998
00:43:46,858 --> 00:43:48,491
 It's a big, giant world tour.

999
00:43:48,493 --> 00:43:50,460
     They're going all over
the place, and I find out,

1000
00:43:50,462 --> 00:43:53,162
next Wednesday they're gonna be
      in Istanbul, Turkey.

1001
00:43:53,164 --> 00:43:55,632
        I can't go
      to Istanbul, Turkey.

1002
00:43:55,634 --> 00:43:57,467
    I've got to walk onstage
        in Burbank

1003
00:43:57,469 --> 00:43:59,869
and say, "Carey, you're fired,"
and then go fuck a melon.

1004
00:43:59,871 --> 00:44:01,070
        I've got a job!

1005
00:44:01,072 --> 00:44:02,639
        [laughter]

1006
00:44:02,641 --> 00:44:05,908
 But I go to see Drew, because
  Drew Carey was my boss then.

1007
00:44:05,910 --> 00:44:07,710
      He's my friend now.
We've been friends for 20 years.

1008
00:44:07,712 --> 00:44:08,945
 He's a beautiful human being.

1009
00:44:08,947 --> 00:44:10,546
          I love Drew
    very, very much indeed.

1010
00:44:10,548 --> 00:44:13,216
  To be honest, I preferred it
  when he was fat and unhappy,

1011
00:44:13,218 --> 00:44:14,517
but what are you gonna do?

1012
00:44:14,519 --> 00:44:16,653
             So...

1013
00:44:16,655 --> 00:44:19,155
anyway, I go and see Drew,
    and Drew's great.

1014
00:44:19,157 --> 00:44:20,556
         And I tell him
    about Mick Jagger,

1015
00:44:20,558 --> 00:44:22,225
 and he's like, "Fuck, are you
        kidding me, man?

1016
00:44:22,227 --> 00:44:24,027
      "Take the week off.
    Go to Istanbul, Turkey.

1017
00:44:24,029 --> 00:44:25,161
    Meet Mick Jagger."

1018
00:44:25,163 --> 00:44:26,763
    I'm like, "Right, buddy,
            I will."

1019
00:44:26,765 --> 00:44:28,831
And just as I'm leaving--and you
can check on the Internet

1020
00:44:28,833 --> 00:44:30,133
      to prove it's true--

1021
00:44:30,135 --> 00:44:31,934
        Joe Walsh,
 the guitarist with The Eagles,

1022
00:44:31,936 --> 00:44:33,336
was doing some comedy bits

1023
00:44:33,338 --> 00:44:35,505
    on <i>The Drew Carey Show</i>
          at the time.

1024
00:44:35,507 --> 00:44:37,473
         And Joe Walsh
    is an amazing rock star.

1025
00:44:37,475 --> 00:44:38,841
  He's a fantastic guitarist.

1026
00:44:38,843 --> 00:44:40,543
      ¶ Hotel California

1027
00:44:40,545 --> 00:44:42,311
             [hums]

1028
00:44:42,313 --> 00:44:44,781
 He's an amazing guy, charming
gentleman, lovely person,

1029
00:44:44,783 --> 00:44:47,083
  but he had a very big 1980s.

1030
00:44:47,085 --> 00:44:49,519
        [laughter]

1031
00:44:49,521 --> 00:44:52,722
 And the whole period has left
        him a little bit

1032
00:44:52,724 --> 00:44:55,158
        "Jim from <i>Taxi."</i>

1033
00:44:55,160 --> 00:44:57,860
        [laughter]

1034
00:44:57,862 --> 00:45:00,329
          So Joe hears
that I'm gonna meet Mick Jagger,

1035
00:45:00,331 --> 00:45:03,299
          and he says,
    "Say hi to Mick for me."

1036
00:45:03,301 --> 00:45:04,901
I said, "Do you know him?"

1037
00:45:04,903 --> 00:45:08,905
     He said, "I think so."

1038
00:45:08,907 --> 00:45:10,540
  I was like, "You think so?"

1039
00:45:10,542 --> 00:45:14,377
  He said, "I think I partied
     with him in the '80s,

1040
00:45:14,379 --> 00:45:18,481
      but I may just have
        seen him on TV."

1041
00:45:18,483 --> 00:45:20,183
          I was like,
     "All right, whatever."

1042
00:45:20,185 --> 00:45:22,418
         So I head off
      to Istanbul, Turkey.

1043
00:45:22,420 --> 00:45:24,320
      It's a very long way
  from Los Angeles, Istanbul.

1044
00:45:24,322 --> 00:45:25,855
    First, a 12-hour flight
        to London,

1045
00:45:25,857 --> 00:45:27,790
and I'm sitting in coach--
     it was a long flight.

1046
00:45:27,792 --> 00:45:30,359
         It was bumpy,
and the kid's behind me, "Aah."

1047
00:45:30,361 --> 00:45:32,395
     And I was all tweaked
          and nervous.

1048
00:45:32,397 --> 00:45:34,797
The it's a 4-hour layover
     in Heathrow in London.

1049
00:45:34,799 --> 00:45:36,733
         Very difficult
to change planes in London

1050
00:45:36,735 --> 00:45:38,501
      because the English
     are fucking bastards!

1051
00:45:38,503 --> 00:45:40,536
         And then I get
      on a smaller plane,

1052
00:45:40,538 --> 00:45:42,772
        a smaller plane
    to go to Istanbul.

1053
00:45:42,774 --> 00:45:44,273
    It's another four hours.

1054
00:45:44,275 --> 00:45:45,875
    And the kid's behind me,
      and it's turbulent,

1055
00:45:45,877 --> 00:45:48,344
  and the chickens are falling
  out of the overhead luggage.

1056
00:45:48,346 --> 00:45:50,580
        Then I get to--
  I haven't slept in 24 hours.

1057
00:45:50,582 --> 00:45:52,582
 I'm tweaked, and I'm nervous,
     and I'm all kind of--

1058
00:45:52,584 --> 00:45:54,584
And I get to Istanbul at night,
 and I come out of the airport,

1059
00:45:54,586 --> 00:45:56,486
     and it's unbelievable,
         it's amazing.

1060
00:45:56,488 --> 00:45:58,187
  The minarets and the towers
        and the...

1061
00:45:58,189 --> 00:46:02,225
        [chanting]

1062
00:46:02,227 --> 00:46:06,763
    'Cause <i>The Lion King</i> was
    in Istanbul at the time.

1063
00:46:06,765 --> 00:46:08,831
      And I jump in a cab,
and the taxi driver says,

1064
00:46:08,833 --> 00:46:10,566
     [Transylvanian accent]
"Where do you want to go?"

1065
00:46:10,568 --> 00:46:13,069
         [normal voice]
        Because Dracula
    was driving a cab!

1066
00:46:13,071 --> 00:46:16,172
        [laughter]

1067
00:46:18,876 --> 00:46:20,743
     [Transylvanian accent]
    I want to take you

1068
00:46:20,745 --> 00:46:23,913
      to your destination.

1069
00:46:23,915 --> 00:46:25,248
            [laughs]

1070
00:46:25,250 --> 00:46:26,816
         [normal voice]
And I said, "Take me to"--

1071
00:46:26,818 --> 00:46:29,218
The Rolling Stones were staying,
     and I'm not kidding--

1072
00:46:29,220 --> 00:46:32,188
    They were staying
    at the Istanbul Hilton.

1073
00:46:32,190 --> 00:46:33,890
         The good one,
  not the one by the airport.

1074
00:46:33,892 --> 00:46:35,258
             So...

1075
00:46:35,260 --> 00:46:36,626
    This is all true.

1076
00:46:36,628 --> 00:46:38,528
            So I get
    to the Istanbul Hilton.

1077
00:46:38,530 --> 00:46:40,396
    I tipped Dracula.
    He's like, "Thank you."

1078
00:46:40,398 --> 00:46:43,966
And then I go into the reception
         of the hotel,

1079
00:46:43,968 --> 00:46:46,202
and Big Jim Sullivan, head
  of Rolling Stones' security

1080
00:46:46,204 --> 00:46:47,937
          at the time,
lovely, big cockney gent,

1081
00:46:47,939 --> 00:46:49,972
he's like, "You the bloke
    who's here to see Mick?"

1082
00:46:49,974 --> 00:46:51,808
    I went, "Yeah." He went,
  "Yeah, he's waiting for you.

1083
00:46:51,810 --> 00:46:53,743
 "He's in the penthouse suite.
     Go into the elevator,

1084
00:46:53,745 --> 00:46:55,478
  press PH, and it'll take you
  up to the penthouse suite."

1085
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:57,146
          I was like,
    "All right, all right."

1086
00:46:57,148 --> 00:46:59,348
 So I get in the elevator, and
I press PH, and the doors close.

1087
00:46:59,350 --> 00:47:00,583
         And I'm like,

1088
00:47:00,585 --> 00:47:04,120
  ¶ Fadoodle doodle do do do

1089
00:47:04,122 --> 00:47:06,789
     ¶ Fadoodle doodle do

1090
00:47:06,791 --> 00:47:10,159
            [sniffs]

1091
00:47:10,161 --> 00:47:12,328
        ¶ Fadoodle do

1092
00:47:12,330 --> 00:47:15,298
      And the doors open,
and I'm on the penthouse floor,

1093
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:16,899
    and I knock on the door
    to the penthouse suite,

1094
00:47:16,901 --> 00:47:19,569
    and the door is answered
    by Mick Jagger himself.

1095
00:47:19,571 --> 00:47:21,170
  And that's not easy for him
  to do with the little hands,

1096
00:47:21,172 --> 00:47:22,805
         but he did it.

1097
00:47:22,807 --> 00:47:24,507
          And my world
      went into freefall.

1098
00:47:24,509 --> 00:47:28,211
I was like, "Wha-- Wha--"

1099
00:47:28,213 --> 00:47:31,013
     Because in my bedroom
        and in my mind,

1100
00:47:31,015 --> 00:47:32,415
     the guy's 8 foot tall.

1101
00:47:32,417 --> 00:47:34,817
      He's a huge giant--
     8 foot, ah, like that.

1102
00:47:34,819 --> 00:47:36,886
     I never questioned it.
    I never thought--

1103
00:47:36,888 --> 00:47:39,388
     I thought he would be
     at least this height.

1104
00:47:39,390 --> 00:47:42,892
        He's not.
 He's a tiny, little man. Tiny!

1105
00:47:42,894 --> 00:47:46,095
     So I was like, "Aah!"

1106
00:47:46,097 --> 00:47:48,497
I was like, "Don't say anything!
      Don't say anything!

1107
00:47:48,499 --> 00:47:49,966
      "Don't say anything!
      Don't say anything!

1108
00:47:49,968 --> 00:47:54,070
      Don't say anything!
      Don't say anything!"

1109
00:47:54,072 --> 00:47:56,672
And then I said something.

1110
00:47:56,674 --> 00:47:58,841
I shouldn't have said it.
    I couldn't help myself.

1111
00:47:58,843 --> 00:47:59,876
    I couldn't help myself.

1112
00:47:59,878 --> 00:48:01,510
        I said it.
    I wish I hadn't said it.

1113
00:48:01,512 --> 00:48:04,213
          But I said,
     "Oh, you're adorable."

1114
00:48:04,215 --> 00:48:07,350
        [laughter]

1115
00:48:12,956 --> 00:48:16,292
  And he went, "Yeah, come in.
        Come on."

1116
00:48:20,330 --> 00:48:23,266
So I go into the penthouse suite
    of the Istanbul Hilton--

1117
00:48:23,268 --> 00:48:25,501
I swear this is true--and
 I start talking to Mick Jagger

1118
00:48:25,503 --> 00:48:26,903
        about the movie
we're gonna make together.

1119
00:48:26,905 --> 00:48:28,671
         I'm thinking,
"This is really happening.

1120
00:48:28,673 --> 00:48:30,840
      I didn't take acid.
    It's really happening."

1121
00:48:30,842 --> 00:48:32,441
         And we talked
      for a little while,

1122
00:48:32,443 --> 00:48:34,143
        and then it got
    a little awkward,

1123
00:48:34,145 --> 00:48:36,913
  because he said, "Actually,
    I'm a little bit hungry.

1124
00:48:36,915 --> 00:48:38,848
    Are you hungry, Craig?"

1125
00:48:38,850 --> 00:48:41,751
          I was like,
"Yes, I am hungry, Mick Jagger."

1126
00:48:41,753 --> 00:48:44,654
    He was like, "All right,
    I'll call room service,

1127
00:48:44,656 --> 00:48:48,724
 which is not easy for me to do
     with my little hands."

1128
00:48:48,726 --> 00:48:50,126
            [laughs]

1129
00:48:50,128 --> 00:48:53,296
        I'm such a dick.
        I'm sorry.

1130
00:48:53,298 --> 00:48:55,097
         So, you know,
     he calls room service.

1131
00:48:55,099 --> 00:48:56,265
  Now, the room service guy's

1132
00:48:56,267 --> 00:48:57,800
      got the little panel
        in front of him,

1133
00:48:57,802 --> 00:49:00,136
    and the room service guy
    knows who it is calling.

1134
00:49:00,138 --> 00:49:01,404
  I can hear him freaking out.

1135
00:49:01,406 --> 00:49:03,172
          He's like...

1136
00:49:03,174 --> 00:49:05,875
        [Indian accent]
  "Oh, my God, I am so totally
    freaking out right now."

1137
00:49:05,877 --> 00:49:08,044
         [normal voice]
        Now, to be fair,
      he was an Indian guy

1138
00:49:08,046 --> 00:49:11,247
that had moved to Istanbul
  with his boyfriend, Dracula,

1139
00:49:11,249 --> 00:49:13,783
      and they were trying
      to make their way--

1140
00:49:13,785 --> 00:49:15,985
  Look, it's a different story
     for a different night.

1141
00:49:15,987 --> 00:49:18,921
    So Mick's on the phone,
and it got really awkward,

1142
00:49:18,923 --> 00:49:20,823
'cause he's looking at the room
service menu, and he said,

1143
00:49:20,825 --> 00:49:23,960
 "Yeah, I'd like to order a"--
     This is what he said.

1144
00:49:23,962 --> 00:49:27,630
  He said, "I'd like to order
    a quesa-dilla, please."

1145
00:49:27,632 --> 00:49:30,967
     And I was like, "Ah--"

1146
00:49:30,969 --> 00:49:33,602
        [laughter]

1147
00:49:33,604 --> 00:49:36,305
        "Would you like
     a quesa-dilla, Craig?"

1148
00:49:36,307 --> 00:49:40,576
I was like, "Quesa-dilla sounds
lovely, Mick, thank you."

1149
00:49:40,578 --> 00:49:43,879
  "All right, two quesa-dillas
    and a chocolate Yoo-hoo?

1150
00:49:43,881 --> 00:49:46,749
    "Two chocolate Yoo-hoos
      and a Butterfinger?

1151
00:49:46,751 --> 00:49:51,253
Oh, just one Butterfinger.
All right, we can share."

1152
00:49:51,255 --> 00:49:53,055
        And he hung up,
    which is not easy.

1153
00:49:53,057 --> 00:49:56,659
And then 20 minutes later,

1154
00:49:56,661 --> 00:49:59,662
 the entire staff of the hotel
          and Dracula

1155
00:49:59,664 --> 00:50:02,331
            came in
  with the room-service order.

1156
00:50:02,333 --> 00:50:04,266
    They laid it out,
    and Mick was very nice.

1157
00:50:04,268 --> 00:50:06,002
     He did the photographs
  and the autographs with them

1158
00:50:06,004 --> 00:50:07,403
         and all that,
      and they went away,

1159
00:50:07,405 --> 00:50:09,638
 and then I had my quesa-dilla,

1160
00:50:09,640 --> 00:50:12,108
         'cause that's
     what I call them now.

1161
00:50:12,110 --> 00:50:14,010
        I had my--
         Mick had his.

1162
00:50:14,012 --> 00:50:15,277
        [chomping]

1163
00:50:15,279 --> 00:50:17,847
        [laughter]

1164
00:50:17,849 --> 00:50:19,315
        [chomping]

1165
00:50:19,317 --> 00:50:21,917
Like that. Like something
out of Richard Gere's ass!

1166
00:50:21,919 --> 00:50:24,353
            [chomps]

1167
00:50:24,355 --> 00:50:26,055
      No, that's too much.

1168
00:50:26,057 --> 00:50:28,991
  It wasn't like that at all.
     I'm sorry I said that.

1169
00:50:28,993 --> 00:50:31,227
    That's too--Forget that.
      We'll cut that out.

1170
00:50:31,229 --> 00:50:32,728
             So...

1171
00:50:32,730 --> 00:50:35,898
            [laughs]

1172
00:50:35,900 --> 00:50:38,234
    So, anyway, we're having
    our quesa-dillas,

1173
00:50:38,236 --> 00:50:40,703
  and then we continue to talk
  about the idea that Mick had

1174
00:50:40,705 --> 00:50:43,339
      that Mark Twain had
     150 years before him.

1175
00:50:43,341 --> 00:50:45,041
        And then--
and this really happened.

1176
00:50:45,043 --> 00:50:47,343
  After a few hours, he goes,
 "Oh, we'll have to stop now."

1177
00:50:47,345 --> 00:50:49,011
  And I was like, "All right."

1178
00:50:49,013 --> 00:50:53,049
And he went, "No, it's just that
I have to go to a party."

1179
00:50:53,051 --> 00:50:54,683
      I was like, "Okay."

1180
00:50:54,685 --> 00:50:57,753
    And then he said,
     "Do you want to come?"

1181
00:50:57,755 --> 00:51:01,791
And I said, "Yes, Mick Jagger of
 The fucking Rolling Stones"...

1182
00:51:01,793 --> 00:51:03,959
        [laughter]

1183
00:51:03,961 --> 00:51:06,796
        "I will go
     to a party with you."

1184
00:51:06,798 --> 00:51:10,132
            He went,
  "All right, then, come on!"

1185
00:51:10,134 --> 00:51:12,301
     So we get in his car,
and we drive to the party,

1186
00:51:12,303 --> 00:51:13,869
    Well, someone drives us.

1187
00:51:13,871 --> 00:51:16,005
  Mick can't drive, you know,
     with the little hands.

1188
00:51:16,007 --> 00:51:17,206
    So we get to the party.

1189
00:51:17,208 --> 00:51:19,608
And the party is being held at,
        I'm not kidding,

1190
00:51:19,610 --> 00:51:21,010
     the British Consulate
          in Istanbul,

1191
00:51:21,012 --> 00:51:22,845
      The British Embassy
          in Istanbul,

1192
00:51:22,847 --> 00:51:24,647
and they're throwing a reception
    for The Rolling Stones,

1193
00:51:24,649 --> 00:51:26,348
 'cause they're proud of them.

1194
00:51:26,350 --> 00:51:27,716
    And the British Embassy,
        of course,

1195
00:51:27,718 --> 00:51:29,418
is guarded by the British Army.

1196
00:51:29,420 --> 00:51:32,321
And the British Army is the same
as any other army in the world.

1197
00:51:32,323 --> 00:51:33,589
 The U.S. Army, French, German,

1198
00:51:33,591 --> 00:51:35,658
    every army in the world
        shares one rule,

1199
00:51:35,660 --> 00:51:38,594
 which is nobody fucking tells
     anybody anything ever,

1200
00:51:38,596 --> 00:51:41,597
 particularly if it would avoid
         embarrassment.

1201
00:51:41,599 --> 00:51:43,099
 So the soldiers have been told

1202
00:51:43,101 --> 00:51:45,468
      that someone famous
     is coming to a party.

1203
00:51:45,470 --> 00:51:47,636
    They have not been told
        who it is.

1204
00:51:47,638 --> 00:51:50,339
    So we get to the party,
and I get out of the car first.

1205
00:51:50,341 --> 00:51:52,007
 And the first person to see us

1206
00:51:52,009 --> 00:51:54,677
    is a big staff sergeant
from Glasgow in Scotland,

1207
00:51:54,679 --> 00:51:58,114
      and he recognizes me
     from local television.

1208
00:51:58,116 --> 00:52:00,850
     [cheers and applause]

1209
00:52:00,852 --> 00:52:03,719
         Swear to God.

1210
00:52:03,721 --> 00:52:06,789
     And he says--he says,

1211
00:52:06,791 --> 00:52:11,627
 "Bloody hell. Craig Ferguson,
what are you doing here?"

1212
00:52:11,629 --> 00:52:15,498
  And Mick Jagger is standing
      right fucking there.

1213
00:52:15,500 --> 00:52:18,334
    And here's the thing...

1214
00:52:18,336 --> 00:52:21,971
  Mick did not handle it well.

1215
00:52:21,973 --> 00:52:25,407
 He was like, "What's going on?
    That is so rude."

1216
00:52:25,409 --> 00:52:27,143
     And I can understand.

1217
00:52:27,145 --> 00:52:29,145
     I mean, he's not used
     to that kind of thing.

1218
00:52:29,147 --> 00:52:31,580
He's always the most famous guy
      in the room, always.

1219
00:52:31,582 --> 00:52:33,716
If Mick Jagger walks into a bar
         with the Pope,

1220
00:52:33,718 --> 00:52:35,684
  the bartender would be like,
         "Hello, Mick.

1221
00:52:35,686 --> 00:52:37,720
    Who's your friend
    with the big hat?"

1222
00:52:37,722 --> 00:52:39,688
He's always the most famous guy.

1223
00:52:39,690 --> 00:52:43,459
That band became famous in 1962,

1224
00:52:43,461 --> 00:52:45,561
      the year I was born,

1225
00:52:45,563 --> 00:52:49,231
when dinosaurs ruled the Earth!

1226
00:52:49,233 --> 00:52:52,801
Actually, that's probably
where he got that, "Ahh."

1227
00:52:54,704 --> 00:52:56,739
     So he was really mad.

1228
00:52:56,741 --> 00:52:59,441
 He was like, "That is so rude.
        I'm so annoyed."

1229
00:52:59,443 --> 00:53:03,179
        [laughter]

1230
00:53:03,181 --> 00:53:04,513
 I was like, "Let it go, man."

1231
00:53:04,515 --> 00:53:08,584
          He was like,
    "I will not let it go."

1232
00:53:10,353 --> 00:53:13,122
    "I will not let it go."

1233
00:53:13,124 --> 00:53:16,058
    He started Riverdancing.

1234
00:53:18,595 --> 00:53:21,730
    "I will not let it go."

1235
00:53:25,769 --> 00:53:29,872
98% of this story is true.

1236
00:53:29,874 --> 00:53:32,174
No, he wouldn't let it go.
     He was really annoyed.

1237
00:53:32,176 --> 00:53:33,909
And then I said something
 I really shouldn't have said.

1238
00:53:33,911 --> 00:53:35,244
          I was like,
     "Oh, let it go, man."

1239
00:53:35,246 --> 00:53:36,879
          He was like,
  "No, I will not let it go."

1240
00:53:36,881 --> 00:53:40,049
    I was like, "Stop being
     such a fucking queen."

1241
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:45,888
     Anyway, we didn't make
        the movie.

1242
00:53:45,890 --> 00:53:48,224
        [laughter]

1243
00:53:48,226 --> 00:53:50,326
  But that's not--I'm kind of
 painting it like he's a dick.

1244
00:53:50,328 --> 00:53:52,127
And he's not a dick. He's fine.
        He's all right.

1245
00:53:52,129 --> 00:53:54,263
We actually tried to make
     the movie for a while.

1246
00:53:54,265 --> 00:53:55,464
We tried for about a year.

1247
00:53:55,466 --> 00:53:56,966
        I was, you know,
      working in Burbank,

1248
00:53:56,968 --> 00:53:59,235
     and then I was on tour
    with The Rolling Stones.

1249
00:53:59,237 --> 00:54:00,836
      It was very strange.

1250
00:54:00,838 --> 00:54:03,439
  And, you know, I would write
      pages of the script,

1251
00:54:03,441 --> 00:54:05,241
and I'd give 'em to Mick,
    and he would read them,

1252
00:54:05,243 --> 00:54:06,742
      and he would always
    give me them back,

1253
00:54:06,744 --> 00:54:08,444
    and he would always have
         the same note,

1254
00:54:08,446 --> 00:54:10,312
        which is,
    "Can it be darker?

1255
00:54:10,314 --> 00:54:13,482
 It has to be darker, you know,
  more edgy, dark, more edgy."

1256
00:54:13,484 --> 00:54:15,084
 And I'd try and make it darker
         and more edgy

1257
00:54:15,086 --> 00:54:16,685
    and give it back to him,
          and he'd go,

1258
00:54:16,687 --> 00:54:19,588
    "No, darker, more edgy."

1259
00:54:21,858 --> 00:54:23,959
  I'm like, "How dark and edgy
        can it be, man?

1260
00:54:23,961 --> 00:54:25,761
        It's the fucking
     <i>Prince and the Pauper."</i>

1261
00:54:25,763 --> 00:54:27,630
          He was like,
    "No, darker, more edgy.

1262
00:54:27,632 --> 00:54:29,031
        And I'm typing,
     and darker, more edgy.

1263
00:54:29,033 --> 00:54:30,899
    Eventually I went
    to the Mark Twain story,

1264
00:54:30,901 --> 00:54:35,371
      just started typing
the fucker out, you know.

1265
00:54:35,373 --> 00:54:37,573
This guy's a better writer
than anyone else, anyway.

1266
00:54:37,575 --> 00:54:39,441
         Let's do this.

1267
00:54:39,443 --> 00:54:40,809
    But he kept saying it--

1268
00:54:40,811 --> 00:54:42,611
      "Darker, more edgy.
      Darker, more edgy."

1269
00:54:42,613 --> 00:54:45,247
 So eventually I went too far.

1270
00:54:48,585 --> 00:54:53,122
 I made his character a serial
killer with Tourette's syndrome.

1271
00:54:53,124 --> 00:54:55,591
        [laughter]

1272
00:54:55,593 --> 00:54:57,926
        And he fired me.

1273
00:54:57,928 --> 00:54:59,928
  But even as he's firing me,
         I'm thinking,

1274
00:54:59,930 --> 00:55:04,500
         "Getting fired
    by Mick Jagger...

1275
00:55:04,502 --> 00:55:07,736
        I'm on my way."

1276
00:55:07,738 --> 00:55:10,272
     But here's the thing.

1277
00:55:10,274 --> 00:55:12,141
        [applause]

1278
00:55:12,143 --> 00:55:13,876
    Because I was with them
    for about a year,

1279
00:55:13,878 --> 00:55:15,544
  I got to know how that band
    works pretty well,

1280
00:55:15,546 --> 00:55:18,714
  and I was surprised by what
  I found out, 'cause I was--

1281
00:55:18,716 --> 00:55:20,115
 Like everybody else, I think,

1282
00:55:20,117 --> 00:55:22,384
  I thought The Rolling Stones
         was, you know,

1283
00:55:22,386 --> 00:55:24,219
    it was Mick Jagger
and Keith Richards' band,

1284
00:55:24,221 --> 00:55:26,322
 or maybe it was Mick Jagger's
      band, but it's not.

1285
00:55:26,324 --> 00:55:29,892
It's Keith Richards' band.
 Keith Richards runs that shit.

1286
00:55:29,894 --> 00:55:32,428
Mick Jagger is the singer
    in Keith Richards' band.

1287
00:55:32,430 --> 00:55:34,930
  People think Keith Richards
 is some out-of-control junkie.

1288
00:55:34,932 --> 00:55:39,335
And there's an element of truth
        to that, but...

1289
00:55:39,337 --> 00:55:41,637
But he's tough, Keith Richards,
            as well.

1290
00:55:41,639 --> 00:55:43,572
     He's a very tough guy.
    He's south London.

1291
00:55:43,574 --> 00:55:46,075
He's like, "What the fuck?
 I'll fuck you up, all right?"

1292
00:55:46,077 --> 00:55:47,843
        [mumbles]

1293
00:55:47,845 --> 00:55:51,580
        "Fuck you, man."

1294
00:55:51,582 --> 00:55:53,048
      He's fucking tough.

1295
00:55:53,050 --> 00:55:55,384
    He's like Jason Statham
     in drag or something.

1296
00:55:55,386 --> 00:55:59,188
     He's like, "Fucking--"

1297
00:55:59,190 --> 00:56:01,890
          He's tough,
 and people are scared of him.

1298
00:56:01,892 --> 00:56:03,425
  And and he runs that outfit.

1299
00:56:03,427 --> 00:56:05,861
  You can check. This is true.
This happened when I was there.

1300
00:56:05,863 --> 00:56:08,964
 Keith Richards put Ronnie Wood
          into rehab.

1301
00:56:08,966 --> 00:56:11,700
 He made Ronnie go into rehab.

1302
00:56:15,572 --> 00:56:17,373
            How bad
    is your problem, though,

1303
00:56:17,375 --> 00:56:19,308
      if you have to walk
  into a rehab center and say,

1304
00:56:19,310 --> 00:56:23,178
     "Keith Richards thinks
I might be an alcoholic."

1305
00:56:24,581 --> 00:56:26,915
Keith Richards said this?

1306
00:56:26,917 --> 00:56:29,551
     "Yeah, he also thinks
     I do too much heroin."

1307
00:56:29,553 --> 00:56:32,321
Keith Richards said this?

1308
00:56:32,323 --> 00:56:34,056
    Quick, get in here, man.

1309
00:56:34,058 --> 00:56:35,958
 But they're frightened of him.

1310
00:56:35,960 --> 00:56:38,260
 Everyone's frightened of Keith
     'cause he's so tough.

1311
00:56:38,262 --> 00:56:40,362
     And I found this out,
'cause I was asking Mick--

1312
00:56:40,364 --> 00:56:42,598
 What I wanted to do when I was
    writing this screenplay

1313
00:56:42,600 --> 00:56:43,866
is I wanted to get on the stage

1314
00:56:43,868 --> 00:56:45,434
    with The Rolling Stones
        one night.

1315
00:56:45,436 --> 00:56:47,469
     I was just gonna stand
  next to Charlie's drum riser

1316
00:56:47,471 --> 00:56:48,937
    and watch the audience.

1317
00:56:48,939 --> 00:56:50,773
 I thought I could write it in
    if I could see it.

1318
00:56:50,775 --> 00:56:53,442
  And Mick was like, "Uh, no.

1319
00:56:53,444 --> 00:56:55,944
No, you can't go on the stage."
     I was like, "Why not?"

1320
00:56:55,946 --> 00:56:58,046
 He was like, "Keith don't like
      people on the stage,

1321
00:56:58,048 --> 00:57:00,382
    and I'm afraid of him."

1322
00:57:02,419 --> 00:57:03,552
      I was like, "What?"

1323
00:57:03,554 --> 00:57:07,089
            He went,
    "Yeah, he could hurt me.

1324
00:57:07,091 --> 00:57:09,658
    "He's very strong.

1325
00:57:09,660 --> 00:57:11,894
    And I'm afraid of him."

1326
00:57:11,896 --> 00:57:13,495
    I was like, "Oh, okay."

1327
00:57:13,497 --> 00:57:15,931
So I started asking the roadies
if they could sneak me onstage,

1328
00:57:15,933 --> 00:57:17,533
 and all the roadies are like,

1329
00:57:17,535 --> 00:57:20,135
    "No, we can't sneak you
 on the stage. No, sorry, mate.

1330
00:57:20,137 --> 00:57:22,738
     "Sorry, governor. No,
Mary Poppins, we couldn't do it.

1331
00:57:22,740 --> 00:57:25,774
     "No, we can't get you
         on the stage.

1332
00:57:25,776 --> 00:57:28,577
  "No, we couldn't do it, sir,
  because Keith would hurt us.

1333
00:57:28,579 --> 00:57:31,113
"He's very strong, you see, sir,
          very strong.

1334
00:57:31,115 --> 00:57:32,915
          "No, Oliver,
    you can't have any more!

1335
00:57:32,917 --> 00:57:36,785
  No! He's very, very strong.
    He would kill us."

1336
00:57:38,087 --> 00:57:39,955
    Everyone who works
     for The Rolling Stones

1337
00:57:39,957 --> 00:57:43,292
        used to be
     in Monty Python, so...

1338
00:57:43,294 --> 00:57:45,928
    But eventually one night
    I made it happen.

1339
00:57:45,930 --> 00:57:48,430
  We were in a beautiful town
    in northern Spain,

1340
00:57:48,432 --> 00:57:51,133
         a town called
Santiago del Compostela--

1341
00:57:51,135 --> 00:57:52,801
        beautiful town,
         and what I did

1342
00:57:52,803 --> 00:57:55,504
 was I bribed the local Spanish
        security guards

1343
00:57:55,506 --> 00:57:56,905
  to let me get on the stage.

1344
00:57:56,907 --> 00:57:58,774
          And I was up
  next to Charlie's drum riser

1345
00:57:58,776 --> 00:58:01,210
 looking at the 60,000 Spanish
        rock fans.

1346
00:58:01,212 --> 00:58:02,878
        It was amazing.
        They're like...

1347
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:05,214
[imitating crowd cheering]

1348
00:58:05,216 --> 00:58:07,516
  Which is how Spanish people
    express gratitude.

1349
00:58:07,518 --> 00:58:08,984
        They go, "Ahh,"

1350
00:58:08,986 --> 00:58:11,320
          which can be
      a bit disconcerting

1351
00:58:11,322 --> 00:58:13,489
    if you hold a door open
     for someone in Madrid,

1352
00:58:13,491 --> 00:58:16,158
      and they go, "Ahh."

1353
00:58:18,161 --> 00:58:21,063
 Am I right, guy from Portugal?
             Yeah!

1354
00:58:21,065 --> 00:58:25,100
     [Transylvanian accent]
      You know, he's right
         about, "Ahh."

1355
00:58:25,102 --> 00:58:27,102
            So I was
 next to Charlie's drum riser,

1356
00:58:27,104 --> 00:58:28,737
    and Charlie doesn't know
        I'm there.

1357
00:58:28,739 --> 00:58:31,874
     To be honest, Charlie
doesn't really know he's there.

1358
00:58:31,876 --> 00:58:33,709
    Charlie had a big 1980s
            as well

1359
00:58:33,711 --> 00:58:36,178
and '60s and '70s and '90s
        and kind of now.

1360
00:58:36,180 --> 00:58:38,814
  So Charlie's doing his thing
      that he always does.

1361
00:58:38,816 --> 00:58:41,984
          He's like...

1362
00:58:41,986 --> 00:58:45,087
        [laughter]

1363
00:58:57,967 --> 00:59:01,870
    ¶ Gas, gas, gas

1364
00:59:03,673 --> 00:59:05,974
     He's doing his thing,
 and Mick is down in the front.

1365
00:59:05,976 --> 00:59:10,546
         He's going...
        [humming]

1366
00:59:10,548 --> 00:59:12,147
And Keith's where he always is.
    Keith's doing his thing.

1367
00:59:12,149 --> 00:59:15,150
          He's like...
        [grumbles]

1368
00:59:15,152 --> 00:59:16,818
¶ Ooh, I'll fuck you up ¶

1369
00:59:16,820 --> 00:59:18,787
        [humming]

1370
00:59:18,789 --> 00:59:20,055
 And he's smoking a cigarette,

1371
00:59:20,057 --> 00:59:22,391
        and the smoke is
      coming up like that.

1372
00:59:22,393 --> 00:59:24,459
And he's got cigarette on
the machine heads of his guitar

1373
00:59:24,461 --> 00:59:26,295
and the smoke's coming up
        like that.

1374
00:59:26,297 --> 00:59:29,031
      He's got a cigarette
    coming out of his boot,

1375
00:59:29,033 --> 00:59:30,265
and the smoke's coming out
        like that.

1376
00:59:30,267 --> 00:59:32,100
  He's wearing a skull earring

1377
00:59:32,102 --> 00:59:34,736
         and the skull
    is smoking a cigarette.

1378
00:59:34,738 --> 00:59:36,238
    Smoke is all around him.

1379
00:59:36,240 --> 00:59:37,639
     He looks like Pigpen.

1380
00:59:37,641 --> 00:59:39,107
          He's like...
            [growls]

1381
00:59:39,109 --> 00:59:40,876
     And he's playing away,
      and he turns around,

1382
00:59:40,878 --> 00:59:43,478
and, boom, he looks right at me
        and locks eyes,

1383
00:59:43,480 --> 00:59:45,914
      and I'm like, "Shit.

1384
00:59:45,916 --> 00:59:49,151
        I'm gonna die."

1385
00:59:49,153 --> 00:59:50,819
      And he doesn't break
          eye contact.

1386
00:59:50,821 --> 00:59:52,354
    He doesn't stop playing,

1387
00:59:52,356 --> 00:59:55,490
  but he starts slowly moving
          towards me.

1388
00:59:55,492 --> 00:59:57,626
        [humming]

1389
00:59:57,628 --> 00:59:59,394
And I can hear the roadies
    on their headsets going,

1390
00:59:59,396 --> 01:00:01,463
  "What the fuck is going on?
        Keith is moving!

1391
01:00:01,465 --> 01:00:03,231
    "Keith is moving!

1392
01:00:03,233 --> 01:00:06,568
Keith hasn't moved in 40 years!
  What the fuck is going on?"

1393
01:00:06,570 --> 01:00:09,805
  And he's getting closer and
closer, slowly across the stage.

1394
01:00:09,807 --> 01:00:11,306
          He's like...
             [hums]

1395
01:00:11,308 --> 01:00:15,644
 He's like a slow comet moving.

1396
01:00:15,646 --> 01:00:18,614
And he got right up close to me,
and I thought, "I'm gonna die."

1397
01:00:18,616 --> 01:00:20,616
And he got this close, and this
is exactly what happened.

1398
01:00:20,618 --> 01:00:23,885
    He went, "Hello, mate."

1399
01:00:23,887 --> 01:00:26,822
        [laughter]

1400
01:00:26,824 --> 01:00:29,458
     So I went back in time

1401
01:00:29,460 --> 01:00:31,994
to my bedroom in Scotland
    when I was a little boy,

1402
01:00:31,996 --> 01:00:33,462
     I took down the poster
        of Mick Jagger.

1403
01:00:33,464 --> 01:00:35,197
      I put up the poster
    of Keith Richards,

1404
01:00:35,199 --> 01:00:38,667
and I went, "That's the fucking
    rock star in that band."

1405
01:00:38,669 --> 01:00:41,269
     [cheers and applause]

1406
01:00:44,774 --> 01:00:48,977
 It changed my <i>Weltanschauung.</i>

1407
01:00:51,481 --> 01:00:53,715
    Anyway, the thing that's
freaking me out about all this--

1408
01:00:53,717 --> 01:00:55,584
  Now, 'cause you really know
    it's Keith's band.

1409
01:00:55,586 --> 01:00:57,419
I mean, I traveled around
         in their jet.

1410
01:00:57,421 --> 01:00:59,354
  They have a jet, but it's--
Of course they have a jet,

1411
01:00:59,356 --> 01:01:01,223
    but it's not like
     a little private jet.

1412
01:01:01,225 --> 01:01:04,126
        They rent a 757
    from the airlines.

1413
01:01:04,128 --> 01:01:05,727
        And you can tell
    it's Keith's band,

1414
01:01:05,729 --> 01:01:08,296
     because Keith and all
his friends sit in first class,

1415
01:01:08,298 --> 01:01:10,532
 and Mick has to sit in coach.

1416
01:01:10,534 --> 01:01:13,635
 And I know that's true, 'cause
I was sitting next to him.

1417
01:01:13,637 --> 01:01:15,370
    And he likes to pretend
         it's his idea.

1418
01:01:15,372 --> 01:01:17,339
He's like, "Yeah, I like sitting
    here because I can reach

1419
01:01:17,341 --> 01:01:20,542
  "the table and the seat-back
    in front of me...

1420
01:01:22,745 --> 01:01:24,646
         "And enjoy..."

1421
01:01:26,516 --> 01:01:28,483
        "Well, these are
        very good sizes,

1422
01:01:28,485 --> 01:01:30,852
  "these bottles, aren't they?

1423
01:01:30,854 --> 01:01:33,522
"This is a proper size. I don't
 like these big, giant bottles.

1424
01:01:33,524 --> 01:01:35,857
  "They frighten me, but these
    bottles are just perfect

1425
01:01:35,859 --> 01:01:40,429
      for my little hands
  and my tiny, little mouth."

1426
01:01:40,431 --> 01:01:42,631
        [laughter]

1427
01:01:42,633 --> 01:01:45,033
What's freaking me out is,
        I thought,

1428
01:01:45,035 --> 01:01:46,735
 "God, these guys are so old."

1429
01:01:46,737 --> 01:01:50,072
  But now I am almost the age
that they were when I met them.

1430
01:01:50,074 --> 01:01:51,873
        I'm like,
"What the fuck happened?"

1431
01:01:51,875 --> 01:01:53,241
    One minute it's...

1432
01:01:53,243 --> 01:01:54,810
    ¶ Fuck the queen,
    fuck you to the queen ¶

1433
01:01:54,812 --> 01:01:57,179
Next minute, some guy has
     a finger in your ass.

1434
01:01:57,181 --> 01:02:00,615
    A doctor. A doctor
  has his finger in your ass.

1435
01:02:02,385 --> 01:02:04,586
    I like my doctor.
    He's a very good doctor.

1436
01:02:04,588 --> 01:02:07,823
    He's only got one flaw,
 in that he thinks he's funny,

1437
01:02:07,825 --> 01:02:09,224
      which is not great.

1438
01:02:09,226 --> 01:02:11,193
         I enjoy a joke
    as much as anyone,

1439
01:02:11,195 --> 01:02:12,527
  but there are times in life

1440
01:02:12,529 --> 01:02:16,631
     when I believe levity
    is inappropriate.

1441
01:02:16,633 --> 01:02:20,902
And I believe the prostate exam
     is one of those times.

1442
01:02:20,904 --> 01:02:22,938
 'Cause he's got a joke that he
likes to do when he's doing it.

1443
01:02:22,940 --> 01:02:25,173
 I'm like, "Don't do that joke.
     It's a horrible joke."

1444
01:02:25,175 --> 01:02:26,908
        He's like,
    "No, it's a great joke.

1445
01:02:26,910 --> 01:02:28,643
Everybody loves that joke." I'm
 like, "Nobody likes the joke.

1446
01:02:28,645 --> 01:02:30,612
      They put up with it
because you're a great doctor."

1447
01:02:30,614 --> 01:02:32,214
     He's like, "Come on!"
    This is his joke.

1448
01:02:32,216 --> 01:02:34,216
He gives you the prostate exam,
          and he says,

1449
01:02:34,218 --> 01:02:35,550
     "Say my name, bitch."

1450
01:02:35,552 --> 01:02:38,587
        I'm like,
     "It's not funny, man."

1451
01:02:40,490 --> 01:02:43,391
  I don't think that's funny.

1452
01:02:45,995 --> 01:02:48,497
  And I said to him last time
  I got the exam, I was like,

1453
01:02:48,499 --> 01:02:49,965
"Don't say it, all right?
It kind of freaks me out."

1454
01:02:49,967 --> 01:02:51,600
    He's like, "Okay,
    I don't need to say it."

1455
01:02:51,602 --> 01:02:53,401
          But I think
    he does need to say it.

1456
01:02:53,403 --> 01:02:54,836
            I think
it's a kind of OCD thing,

1457
01:02:54,838 --> 01:02:56,571
  'cause he gave me the exam,
         and he went...

1458
01:02:56,573 --> 01:02:58,640
          [whispering]
     "Say my name, bitch."

1459
01:02:58,642 --> 01:03:02,010
I'm like, "You know what?
 It's worse if you whisper it!"

1460
01:03:05,481 --> 01:03:07,482
 Anyway, it's not the prostate
    exam that makes you old.

1461
01:03:07,484 --> 01:03:09,551
It's your attitude to it.
      This is what I mean.

1462
01:03:09,553 --> 01:03:11,820
      Like, the last time
    I got the prostate exam,

1463
01:03:11,822 --> 01:03:14,956
he finished, and he said,
"Actually, I have to say, Craig,

1464
01:03:14,958 --> 01:03:16,925
  for a man your age, you have
    a very smooth prostate."

1465
01:03:16,927 --> 01:03:20,595
And this is how I know I'm old,
      because I was proud.

1466
01:03:22,265 --> 01:03:24,699
 I was, like, going up to girls
      in the supermarket,

1467
01:03:24,701 --> 01:03:26,134
             "Hey."

1468
01:03:29,605 --> 01:03:34,176
  "I've got a smooth prostate.

1469
01:03:34,178 --> 01:03:36,745
    Want to touch it?"

1470
01:03:36,747 --> 01:03:38,814
    I do have a very smooth
    prostate, though.

1471
01:03:38,816 --> 01:03:41,983
  It's true, you part my butt
  cheeks, you'll hear Kenny G.

1472
01:03:41,985 --> 01:03:44,886
        [laughter]

1473
01:03:44,888 --> 01:03:47,122
     ¶ Fadoodle doodle do

1474
01:03:47,124 --> 01:03:49,724
 No, when you turn 50, it's not
a finger anymore, it's a camera.

1475
01:03:49,726 --> 01:03:51,860
 They put a camera in your ass.
I think the older you get,

1476
01:03:51,862 --> 01:03:53,562
        the more things
  the medical profession feels

1477
01:03:53,564 --> 01:03:55,463
    they have to shove
         into your ass.

1478
01:03:55,465 --> 01:03:57,399
Like, when you get to about 80,
         they're like,

1479
01:03:57,401 --> 01:03:58,934
"We're just gonna drive up
      in a little minivan,

1480
01:03:58,936 --> 01:04:00,502
      "take a look around.

1481
01:04:00,504 --> 01:04:02,337
         "Don't worry.
  It'll be perfectly painless.

1482
01:04:02,339 --> 01:04:04,406
    "It's gonna be midgets,
midgets will be inside the van,

1483
01:04:04,408 --> 01:04:06,575
 "and they're gonna look around
        with binoculars,

1484
01:04:06,577 --> 01:04:08,810
tiny, little binoculars."

1485
01:04:11,314 --> 01:04:12,814
     No, they put a camera
          in your ass.

1486
01:04:12,816 --> 01:04:14,883
  I mean, it's a tiny, little
    fiber-optic thing.

1487
01:04:14,885 --> 01:04:17,652
  It's not like the old days,
     you know, with the...

1488
01:04:21,891 --> 01:04:26,261
    Look out, Hitler,
bad news coming your way.

1489
01:04:26,263 --> 01:04:29,097
     No, it's a tiny, tiny,
         little camera.

1490
01:04:29,099 --> 01:04:30,398
      Tiny, little camera.

1491
01:04:30,400 --> 01:04:32,868
    But it's kind of like--

1492
01:04:32,870 --> 01:04:34,870
      It's not the camera
  so much as the night before,

1493
01:04:34,872 --> 01:04:37,172
because in order for them
to look around your colon,

1494
01:04:37,174 --> 01:04:38,874
        they have
     to clean it out first.

1495
01:04:38,876 --> 01:04:42,077
So they give you what they call
the super laxative, right?

1496
01:04:42,079 --> 01:04:45,380
Yeah. It's not that super.

1497
01:04:45,382 --> 01:04:46,982
            This is
    a prescription laxative.

1498
01:04:46,984 --> 01:04:49,050
    You can't just go
     and buy this laxative.

 You need a--And it's not just

  It's a prescription written
on a parchment by a monk.

1501
01:04:55,592 --> 01:04:57,826
          It's written
with a big, feathery pen.

1502
01:04:57,828 --> 01:05:00,295
     And then he writes it,
and then the prescription

1503
01:05:00,297 --> 01:05:02,864
  is delivered to the pharmacy
            by owl.

1504
01:05:02,866 --> 01:05:05,767
And then the pharmacist puts on
     the big leather gloves

1505
01:05:05,769 --> 01:05:08,003
 and goes to the back and opens
    the giant circular door

1506
01:05:08,005 --> 01:05:09,471
and the dry ice goes like that,

1507
01:05:09,473 --> 01:05:11,673
    and they take out
    the super laxative

1508
01:05:11,675 --> 01:05:14,009
 and they bring it towards you.

1509
01:05:14,011 --> 01:05:16,845
I was sitting with this laxative
     on the kitchen table,

1510
01:05:16,847 --> 01:05:19,414
      and my wife and kids
    are watching me, going,

01:05:19,416 --> 01:05:21,416
         "Go on, then."

1513
01:05:30,426 --> 01:05:32,060
     And I took this thing,

1514
01:05:32,062 --> 01:05:35,196
  and after about 45 minutes,
     I was like, "Oh, shit!

1520
01:05:49,780 --> 01:05:51,579
      And then it stopped,
         and I thought,

1521
01:05:51,581 --> 01:05:52,847
"Well, that wasn't so bad.

1522

  and I saw the spirit of the
great buffalo coming toward me.

01:11:46,669 --> 01:11:48,603
        Ooh, fuck,
I never told you the joke.

1649
01:11:48,605 --> 01:11:50,104
  All right, here's the joke.

1650
01:11:50,106 --> 01:11:52,140
  The best joke in the world,
          apparently.

1651
01:11:52,142 --> 01:11:53,975
  I don't know. I don't think
     it's that good a joke.

1652
01:11:53,977 --> 01:11:55,910
         You'll decide.
 I don't think it's that great.

1653
01:11:55,912 --> 01:11:59,781
 It's a joke which takes place
    on a golf course.

1654
01:11:59,783 --> 01:12:01,215
         I've recently
     started playing golf,

1655
01:12:01,217 --> 01:12:03,718
        which is unusual
  for a 52-year-old Scotsman.

1656
01:12:03,720 --> 01:12:04,986
  Usually, they start earlier,

1657
01:12:04,988 --> 01:12:07,255
    but it's how I rebelled
    when I was a kid.

1658
01:12:07,257 --> 01:12:08,990
They were all playing golf
         all the time.

1659
01:12:08,992 --> 01:12:12,260
    This is how they play it
          in Scotland.

1660
01:12:12,262 --> 01:12:15,263
 They played golf all the time,
    at home, at work,

1661
01:12:15,265 --> 01:12:17,365
          during sex.

1662
01:12:19,101 --> 01:12:22,270
  There's no sex in Scotland.

1663
01:12:22,272 --> 01:12:24,839
 It's a shame, because Scottish
women are very attractive.

1664
01:12:24,841 --> 01:12:26,174
At least I think they are.

1665
01:12:26,176 --> 01:12:28,676
      I've never seen one
    with her coat off.

1666
01:12:28,678 --> 01:12:32,113
        [laughter]

1667
01:12:32,115 --> 01:12:35,817
  Nothing here for you, Craig.

1668
01:12:35,819 --> 01:12:39,287
  Just tweed all the way down.

1669
01:12:39,289 --> 01:12:41,856
        [laughter]

1670
01:12:41,858 --> 01:12:44,625
      Tweed and potatoes.

1671
01:12:44,627 --> 01:12:48,162
Tweed, potatoes, and a footbag.

1672
01:12:50,566 --> 01:12:54,535
I kind of turned myself on
      a little bit there.

1673
01:12:54,537 --> 01:12:57,105
Anyway, so it takes place
    on a golf course.

1674
01:12:57,107 --> 01:12:58,773
 It's actually Scottish people
          in the joke.

1675
01:12:58,775 --> 01:13:00,508
  Well, look, here's the joke.

1676
01:13:00,510 --> 01:13:02,210
     It's on the 18th hole
    of a golf course.

1677
01:13:02,212 --> 01:13:04,212
      It's a grudge match
        between two guys

1678
01:13:04,214 --> 01:13:06,781
who just hate each other very--
  and it's a putt for the game

1679
01:13:06,783 --> 01:13:08,616
    on the 18th hole,
    very tense moment.

1680
01:13:08,618 --> 01:13:11,152
  And the guy's about to take
the putt, and he looks up,

1681
01:13:11,154 --> 01:13:13,187
and he sees a funeral procession
        going by.

1682
01:13:13,189 --> 01:13:15,156
  So he stops what he's doing,
    takes off his hat,

1683
01:13:15,158 --> 01:13:17,458
    and says a prayer
    for the dearly departed.

1684
01:13:17,460 --> 01:13:19,427
     And his opponent says,
  "I have to say, that is one

1685
01:13:19,429 --> 01:13:22,563
of the most beautiful and
touching things I've ever seen."

1686
01:13:22,565 --> 01:13:24,899
  And he says, "Well, we were
    married 35 years.

1687
01:13:24,901 --> 01:13:28,736
    I feel it's only right."

1688
01:13:28,738 --> 01:13:30,772
     [cheers and applause]

1689
01:13:30,774 --> 01:13:31,839
    And there you are.

1690
01:13:31,841 --> 01:13:33,708
        That's it.

1691
01:13:33,710 --> 01:13:37,745
  The best joke in the world.

1692
01:13:37,747 --> 01:13:39,213
     [cheers and applause]

1693
01:13:39,215 --> 01:13:42,016
  Thank you so much, New York.
          I love you.

1694
01:13:42,018 --> 01:13:44,419
    I'll see you next time.
      I'll bring my sign.

1695
01:13:44,421 --> 01:13:46,788
         Thanks a lot.
     Good night, everybody.

1696
01:13:46,790 --> 01:13:48,756
     [cheers and applause]

1697
01:13:48,758 --> 01:13:51,793
