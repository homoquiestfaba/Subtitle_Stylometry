1
00:00:04,374 --> 00:00:07,124
(dramatic music)

2
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:09,237
(Thunderbird feet stomping)

3
00:03:09,237 --> 00:03:12,305
(Thunderbird cawing)

4
00:03:12,305 --> 00:03:15,972
(Thunderbird feet stomping)

5
00:03:19,061 --> 00:03:22,960
(Thunderbird cawing)

6
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:25,413
(whimpering)

7
00:03:25,413 --> 00:03:29,080
(Thunderbird feet stomping)

8
00:03:31,401 --> 00:03:34,790
(Thunderbird cawing)

9
00:03:34,790 --> 00:03:37,920
(screaming)

10
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,409
(hard breathing)

11
00:03:40,409 --> 00:03:43,076
(phone pinging)

12
00:03:50,322 --> 00:03:51,239
- Oh, shit.

13
00:03:56,882 --> 00:04:00,632
- Eyewitness accounts
of legendary creatures.

14
00:04:04,962 --> 00:04:06,129
Are they myth?

15
00:04:07,138 --> 00:04:08,055
Or reality?

16
00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:15,940
Science doesn't wanna search for clues.

17
00:04:17,584 --> 00:04:20,584
But one group will find the answers.

18
00:04:32,374 --> 00:04:33,874
- P-I-S.

19
00:04:36,747 --> 00:04:39,330
Paranormal Investigation Squad.

20
00:04:41,665 --> 00:04:42,498
Piss.

21
00:04:45,945 --> 00:04:46,945
- Excuse me.

22
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:48,683
- Piss.

23
00:04:49,946 --> 00:04:53,366
That's what people are going
to call it, as an acronym.

24
00:04:53,366 --> 00:04:55,249
- I think the quality speaks for itself.

25
00:04:55,249 --> 00:04:56,332
- Yeah, okay.

26
00:04:58,414 --> 00:05:00,497
Let me get this straight.

27
00:05:02,106 --> 00:05:04,189
You investigate monsters?

28
00:05:05,499 --> 00:05:09,666
- Yeah, UFOs, cryptoids,
the paranormal, all that.

29
00:05:10,677 --> 00:05:12,054
- I'll be presenting the series,

30
00:05:12,054 --> 00:05:15,109
doing the VOICEOVER, location interviews.

31
00:05:15,109 --> 00:05:16,593
- And I'm sorta the talking head.

32
00:05:16,593 --> 00:05:18,660
You know, we cut to me and I explain

33
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:20,107
the science of everything.

34
00:05:20,107 --> 00:05:22,326
- Oh, you're a scientist?

35
00:05:22,326 --> 00:05:24,993
- I'm an independent researcher.

36
00:05:30,890 --> 00:05:32,640
- Okay, just curious.

37
00:05:33,936 --> 00:05:36,058
Exactly how long does it take

38
00:05:36,058 --> 00:05:39,379
to get a degree in monster hunting?

39
00:05:39,379 --> 00:05:42,463
- (chuckles) Anyway, this is obviously

40
00:05:42,463 --> 00:05:45,141
just the trailer for the pilot.

41
00:05:45,141 --> 00:05:47,695
Once we have the full pilot,
we'll be able to pitch it

42
00:05:47,695 --> 00:05:51,283
to distributors and networks,
and they'll pick it up,

43
00:05:51,283 --> 00:05:54,266
and you'll be able to
double, possibly even triple

44
00:05:54,266 --> 00:05:55,488
or more your investment.

45
00:05:55,488 --> 00:05:57,357
You know, just getting
in on the ground floor

46
00:05:57,357 --> 00:05:58,940
and helping us out.

47
00:05:59,669 --> 00:06:02,752
- How much was the introduction cost?

48
00:06:03,699 --> 00:06:07,366
- I spent, uh, about
10,000 of my own funds.

49
00:06:10,766 --> 00:06:11,599
- 10,000?

50
00:06:12,836 --> 00:06:15,023
- We're very committed to this project.

51
00:06:15,023 --> 00:06:15,956
- Yeah.

52
00:06:15,956 --> 00:06:16,862
- I think if you could just...

53
00:06:16,862 --> 00:06:19,092
- Yeah, yeah, you're committed.

54
00:06:19,092 --> 00:06:21,759
Uh, how much are you asking for?

55
00:06:23,159 --> 00:06:25,164
- I think if you look at
our business proposal,

56
00:06:25,375 --> 00:06:26,756
you'll see I've outlined very clearly

57
00:06:26,756 --> 00:06:27,934
all the costs of production,

58
00:06:27,934 --> 00:06:30,852
including the crew, the equipment and...

59
00:06:30,852 --> 00:06:32,852
- We need about 100,000.

60
00:06:34,339 --> 00:06:39,339
- [Lester] Right, 100, that's
pretty much our target budget.

61
00:06:43,598 --> 00:06:44,431
- 100?

62
00:06:45,653 --> 00:06:49,736
- Yeah, that's about our
target budget, yes, sir.

63
00:06:51,177 --> 00:06:52,344
Yes, sir, 100.

64
00:06:55,327 --> 00:06:59,172
- Well I'm gonna stop you right there.

65
00:06:59,493 --> 00:07:00,949
We can't help you.

66
00:07:00,949 --> 00:07:03,728
- But I think if you just
take a minute to look

67
00:07:03,728 --> 00:07:06,600
at our business proposal,
I think you will see

68
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,837
that there is enough there.

69
00:07:08,837 --> 00:07:11,619
What we plan to do with
this particular project...

70
00:07:11,619 --> 00:07:15,539
- Thank you, thank you for coming by, but.

71
00:07:15,539 --> 00:07:18,761
- We've already invested 10 grand.

72
00:07:18,761 --> 00:07:21,198
We're committed to this. We're serious.

73
00:07:21,198 --> 00:07:24,632
- You look serious. We cannot help you.

74
00:07:24,632 --> 00:07:25,465
Thank you.

75
00:07:26,659 --> 00:07:29,409
- You, you, you didn't even look.

76
00:07:30,285 --> 00:07:32,618
- There was no need. Please.

77
00:07:33,658 --> 00:07:36,658
(crickets chirping)

78
00:07:42,249 --> 00:07:45,416
(utensils clattering)

79
00:07:50,406 --> 00:07:53,239
- Clarissa cleans up another mess.

80
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:57,610
This is not my life right now.

81
00:08:07,662 --> 00:08:08,948
Hey.

82
00:08:08,948 --> 00:08:10,295
- What?

83
00:08:10,295 --> 00:08:11,972
- We're finishing that pilot,

84
00:08:11,972 --> 00:08:13,842
no matter how much we gotta spend.

85
00:08:13,842 --> 00:08:15,347
- That's easy for you to say.

86
00:08:15,347 --> 00:08:18,934
I mean, it's not your
savings we're talking about.

87
00:08:18,934 --> 00:08:20,116
- What?

88
00:08:20,116 --> 00:08:24,226
- [Lester] I'm sorry. I mean
it's, look, it's just that we...

89
00:08:24,226 --> 00:08:25,226
- Just what?

90
00:08:27,191 --> 00:08:30,359
- Just what's left was supposed
to be for us, you know.

91
00:08:30,359 --> 00:08:34,280
- Well what we decided was, we
were gonna finish this pilot.

92
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35,113
- I know.

93
00:08:35,113 --> 00:08:38,803
- What we also decided,
if it came down to it,

94
00:08:38,803 --> 00:08:41,303
we were gonna use the savings.

95
00:08:42,819 --> 00:08:44,569
Or are you giving up?

96
00:08:47,853 --> 00:08:49,770
- I am never giving up.

97
00:08:51,383 --> 00:08:54,966
- Good, neither am I.
On you or the series.

98
00:08:59,155 --> 00:09:01,155
Let's go to the bedroom.

99
00:09:18,829 --> 00:09:21,412
(both moaning)

100
00:09:30,354 --> 00:09:32,687
(shrieking)

101
00:09:33,602 --> 00:09:36,185
(both moaning)

102
00:09:54,818 --> 00:09:55,651
Hey.

103
00:09:58,637 --> 00:09:59,887
I have an idea.

104
00:10:01,809 --> 00:10:04,392
(upbeat music)

105
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:25,985
- Hey, Horty.

106
00:10:25,985 --> 00:10:28,668
- Hey, Les, what's up, man? How you been?

107
00:10:28,668 --> 00:10:30,822
- Good, good, how you doing?

108
00:10:30,822 --> 00:10:32,384
- I'm good, man.

109
00:10:32,384 --> 00:10:34,609
So what brings you here?

110
00:10:34,609 --> 00:10:38,246
- Well, I was thinking to
myself, now that I got this

111
00:10:38,246 --> 00:10:42,579
loan all taken care, who
do I know that can offer me

112
00:10:43,697 --> 00:10:46,114
a quality crew and equipment?

113
00:10:47,553 --> 00:10:49,489
- Keep talking, keep talking.

114
00:10:49,489 --> 00:10:51,846
- [Reid] Hey, Horty, I
need those two terabytes.

115
00:10:51,846 --> 00:10:54,193
- Yeah, I'm with a customer.

116
00:10:54,193 --> 00:10:55,934
Sorry about that, man. Go ahead.

117
00:10:55,934 --> 00:10:57,253
- That's all right.

118
00:10:57,253 --> 00:10:59,321
Listen, I'm just gonna cut to the chase.

119
00:10:59,321 --> 00:11:02,218
I would like to offer you a job.

120
00:11:02,218 --> 00:11:04,282
- [Reid] Hey, Horty, I need the footage

121
00:11:04,282 --> 00:11:05,929
from the Olson money.

122
00:11:05,929 --> 00:11:08,262
- Yeah, I'm with a customer.

123
00:11:09,198 --> 00:11:10,666
- Is that Reid?

124
00:11:10,666 --> 00:11:11,561
- [Horty] Who else, man?

125
00:11:11,561 --> 00:11:12,810
- That's good, actually.

126
00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:16,325
Because I would like to
really hire both of you a job.

127
00:11:16,325 --> 00:11:17,754
- Hey, Horty, you know it's gonna take me

128
00:11:17,754 --> 00:11:19,950
forever to put that footage in, come on.

129
00:11:19,950 --> 00:11:20,783
- You see?

130
00:11:21,705 --> 00:11:22,622
- Hi, Reid.

131
00:11:23,564 --> 00:11:24,397
- Hm.

132
00:11:25,933 --> 00:11:28,797
- I love that sassy attitude of yours.

133
00:11:28,797 --> 00:11:32,321
- Anyway, I want to, (clears throat)

134
00:11:32,321 --> 00:11:34,334
since you did such a
good job on the trailer,

135
00:11:34,334 --> 00:11:38,041
pro Bono, I know, I would
like to hire you now

136
00:11:38,041 --> 00:11:39,458
for a paying gig.

137
00:11:41,822 --> 00:11:43,225
- For?

138
00:11:43,225 --> 00:11:46,475
- For finishing the pilot, on location.

139
00:11:47,431 --> 00:11:49,549
- In the forest?

140
00:11:49,549 --> 00:11:51,476
Looking for your bird?

141
00:11:51,476 --> 00:11:56,169
- Yes, and I would like to
write you a check right now

142
00:11:56,169 --> 00:12:00,254
for a down payment to have
you come join our team.

143
00:12:00,254 --> 00:12:04,483
- Well you know, uh, cash doesn't bounce.

144
00:12:04,483 --> 00:12:06,478
(laughing)

145
00:12:06,478 --> 00:12:07,311
- Sassy.

146
00:12:08,434 --> 00:12:09,267
Cash.

147
00:12:10,329 --> 00:12:11,662
So last century.

148
00:12:17,114 --> 00:12:19,864
(birds chirping)

149
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:32,490
(phone ringing)

150
00:12:38,844 --> 00:12:39,970
- Hello.

151
00:12:39,970 --> 00:12:43,271
- Hi there, may I please
speak with Miss Kyra Jordan?

152
00:12:43,271 --> 00:12:44,188
- Speaking.

153
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:49,703
- Excellent, this is
Professor Lester Denton.

154
00:12:49,703 --> 00:12:52,621
I'm calling you about the
undergraduate volunteer

155
00:12:52,621 --> 00:12:56,561
field position internship
that you applied for.

156
00:12:56,561 --> 00:13:00,098
- That's right. How are you, Professor?

157
00:13:00,098 --> 00:13:03,233
- So let me tell you that
I was reading your resume

158
00:13:03,233 --> 00:13:06,603
and cover letter, and I have to say,

159
00:13:06,603 --> 00:13:10,186
I was very, very
impressed with what I saw.

160
00:13:11,474 --> 00:13:12,974
- Well, thank you.

161
00:13:13,857 --> 00:13:15,141
I'm honored.

162
00:13:15,141 --> 00:13:16,141
- Excuse me.

163
00:13:17,259 --> 00:13:18,926
I'm on a sales call.

164
00:13:25,672 --> 00:13:26,984
Sorry about that.

165
00:13:26,984 --> 00:13:29,010
So anyway, I wanted to let you know

166
00:13:29,010 --> 00:13:32,727
we've decided to offer you the internship.

167
00:13:32,727 --> 00:13:35,207
- Really? That's fantastic.

168
00:13:35,207 --> 00:13:36,707
Thank you so much.

169
00:13:38,401 --> 00:13:41,484
Yes, I would love to be a part of it.

170
00:13:42,498 --> 00:13:44,402
- Excellent. Very good, very good.

171
00:13:44,402 --> 00:13:47,926
So let me tell you what the
next steps are, all right?

172
00:13:47,926 --> 00:13:50,759
(traffic passing)

173
00:13:55,755 --> 00:13:58,763
- I've been lead producer on
several major productions.

174
00:13:58,763 --> 00:14:02,543
Hundreds of television shows, some films.

175
00:14:02,543 --> 00:14:04,597
Most of which you'll never see.

176
00:14:04,597 --> 00:14:07,748
Hundreds and hundreds of
pilots get filmed every year.

177
00:14:07,748 --> 00:14:09,439
Most don't get picked up.

178
00:14:09,439 --> 00:14:11,830
- Right, right, that makes sense.

179
00:14:11,830 --> 00:14:14,225
- Every once in a while you get a bite.

180
00:14:14,225 --> 00:14:16,326
Ever heard of Monster Quest?

181
00:14:16,326 --> 00:14:18,826
- Yeah, yeah, I know that one.

182
00:14:20,774 --> 00:14:22,869
- So, this is a new show.

183
00:14:22,869 --> 00:14:24,011
It's a pilot.

184
00:14:24,011 --> 00:14:27,011
I will, of course, be presenting it.

185
00:14:28,666 --> 00:14:30,315
Because we're filming it in the forest,

186
00:14:30,315 --> 00:14:34,001
we need an onsite medic
for everyone's safety.

187
00:14:34,001 --> 00:14:37,190
So, tell me more about
your medical experience.

188
00:14:37,190 --> 00:14:41,776
- Yes, ma'am, I was a 68 Whiskey
combat medic in the Army.

189
00:14:41,776 --> 00:14:45,435
I served in a field
hospital in Afghanistan.

190
00:14:45,435 --> 00:14:48,768
- My, you must have seen a lot of blood.

191
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:56,907
So, what makes you wanna
work on a film crew?

192
00:14:56,907 --> 00:15:00,057
- Well, I always liked the movies, ma'am.

193
00:15:00,057 --> 00:15:01,742
I don't know if there's a career in it,

194
00:15:01,742 --> 00:15:03,995
but I figured I'd give it a shot.

195
00:15:03,995 --> 00:15:06,578
And could use the cash, anyhow.

196
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:10,814
- Well, it's a lot of heavy lifting,

197
00:15:10,814 --> 00:15:13,161
but you still look like
you're in soldier shape.

198
00:15:13,161 --> 00:15:15,514
- Thank you, ma'am.

199
00:15:15,514 --> 00:15:17,764
- No need to call me ma'am.

200
00:15:20,117 --> 00:15:23,700
So, let's get into the
paperwork, shall we?

201
00:15:25,891 --> 00:15:28,724
(traffic passing)

202
00:15:31,267 --> 00:15:34,017
(birds chirping)

203
00:15:50,233 --> 00:15:53,671
(knocking on door)

204
00:15:53,671 --> 00:15:55,742
- Is that Lester?

205
00:15:55,742 --> 00:15:57,299
- [Lester] How you doing?

206
00:15:57,299 --> 00:15:59,677
- Well come on in. Come on in.

207
00:15:59,677 --> 00:16:02,038
- [Lester] All right.

208
00:16:02,038 --> 00:16:02,937
- [Bigsby] Nice to meet you.

209
00:16:02,937 --> 00:16:04,610
- And you, sir.

210
00:16:04,610 --> 00:16:08,574
- So, y'all are looking
to hire a outdoorsman?

211
00:16:08,574 --> 00:16:09,407
Is that right?

212
00:16:09,407 --> 00:16:11,395
- Yes, sir, we are planning an expedition

213
00:16:11,395 --> 00:16:12,978
out into the field.

214
00:16:14,424 --> 00:16:17,635
- You guys ever been
up in those mountains?

215
00:16:17,635 --> 00:16:21,726
Ever done any hiking,
camping, hunting, anything?

216
00:16:21,726 --> 00:16:25,230
- I've done plenty of research
in the field, so yes, sir.

217
00:16:25,230 --> 00:16:27,811
- Research? Really, what kinda research?

218
00:16:27,811 --> 00:16:29,326
- Biological.

219
00:16:29,326 --> 00:16:30,179
- [Bigsby] Is that right?

220
00:16:30,179 --> 00:16:31,838
- We have a wealth of experience.

221
00:16:31,838 --> 00:16:35,331
We've done documentaries,
nature films, et cetera.

222
00:16:35,331 --> 00:16:36,366
I've produced...

223
00:16:36,366 --> 00:16:39,661
- So y'all are looking for
some kinda creature, ain’t you?

224
00:16:39,661 --> 00:16:41,955
Some kinda monster.

225
00:16:41,955 --> 00:16:46,190
- Yes, sir. The Native Americans
call it the Thunderbird,

226
00:16:46,190 --> 00:16:48,194
but I actually think
what we're looking for

227
00:16:48,194 --> 00:16:51,043
is more of a prehistoric reptile.

228
00:16:51,043 --> 00:16:53,945
More pteranadon than a bird.

229
00:16:53,945 --> 00:16:57,154
- Well you know, I've been
ranging a damn long time.

230
00:16:57,154 --> 00:16:59,091
I ain’t never seen nothing like that.

231
00:16:59,091 --> 00:17:00,936
That's a big forest.

232
00:17:00,936 --> 00:17:02,638
A lotta places it could hide.

233
00:17:02,638 --> 00:17:05,289
- Yes, sir, that is,
we are certainly hoping

234
00:17:05,289 --> 00:17:07,164
to get some evidence for it there.

235
00:17:07,164 --> 00:17:10,898
- Well like I said, I was a
forest ranger for a while.

236
00:17:10,898 --> 00:17:12,966
And I can get you in, I can get you out.

237
00:17:12,966 --> 00:17:15,582
Safe and sound, no troubles to it.

238
00:17:15,582 --> 00:17:16,849
- Well that's perfect.

239
00:17:16,849 --> 00:17:18,275
Sounds like you have all the knowledge

240
00:17:18,275 --> 00:17:20,750
and experience we need,
so I'd like to just

241
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:22,722
offer you the position.

242
00:17:22,722 --> 00:17:24,899
- Well, you know what,
give me half upfront,

243
00:17:24,899 --> 00:17:28,697
and when I get you back, give me the rest.

244
00:17:28,697 --> 00:17:30,733
- Well, the thing is, we, um...

245
00:17:30,733 --> 00:17:32,813
- We have a deferred payment contract.

246
00:17:32,813 --> 00:17:34,215
That's standard for this...

247
00:17:34,215 --> 00:17:35,465
- Half upfront.

248
00:17:40,291 --> 00:17:43,273
- I think we can work something out.

249
00:17:43,273 --> 00:17:45,928
Oh, I like that, Lester.

250
00:17:45,928 --> 00:17:47,811
- [Lester] Well, I actually brought all

251
00:17:47,811 --> 00:17:49,342
the paperwork with me.

252
00:17:49,342 --> 00:17:51,550
If there's a place we can
sign, you know, we could just...

253
00:17:51,550 --> 00:17:53,717
- Well I like you, Lester.

254
00:17:58,705 --> 00:17:59,761
- I'm telling you, there's something

255
00:17:59,761 --> 00:18:01,178
not right about that guy.

256
00:18:01,178 --> 00:18:02,311
- Well, you know what?

257
00:18:02,311 --> 00:18:03,663
He's the only one that's in our budget,

258
00:18:03,663 --> 00:18:05,084
and we're plum outta time.

259
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:07,196
Paperwork is signed, so it's done.

260
00:18:07,196 --> 00:18:09,541
- Okay, well, I'm telling
you, if you hear banjo music,

261
00:18:09,541 --> 00:18:11,624
you better run for cover.

262
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:18,757
(soft dramatic music)

263
00:18:36,372 --> 00:18:38,955
(rain falling)

264
00:18:49,475 --> 00:18:51,724
- So we'll head to this point here,

265
00:18:51,724 --> 00:18:53,865
because that's the most
likely nesting grounds.

266
00:18:53,865 --> 00:18:56,126
- What tells you that?

267
00:18:56,126 --> 00:18:59,166
- Because there's a
major water source here.

268
00:18:59,166 --> 00:19:00,749
- Where, this pond?

269
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:05,513
- [Lester] And then we've
got all this foliage here.

270
00:19:05,513 --> 00:19:06,988
Plenty of places to hide.

271
00:19:06,988 --> 00:19:11,309
- Yeah, but we're talking
about a large flying animal.

272
00:19:11,309 --> 00:19:15,059
Okay, you see this?
These are hunting trails.

273
00:19:15,986 --> 00:19:18,606
If an animal of that
size were ranging here,

274
00:19:18,606 --> 00:19:20,856
it would have been spotted.

275
00:19:22,291 --> 00:19:24,334
- You'd be surprised.

276
00:19:24,334 --> 00:19:26,569
- Have you thought of the sort
of ecosystem it would take

277
00:19:26,569 --> 00:19:31,545
to support an animal of the
size we're talking about?

278
00:19:31,545 --> 00:19:33,486
- You're skeptical.

279
00:19:33,486 --> 00:19:36,611
That's good, that's good. That's
thinking like a scientist.

280
00:19:36,611 --> 00:19:38,248
Don't you worry. I know
what I'm talking about.

281
00:19:38,248 --> 00:19:39,570
We are definitely gonna find some

282
00:19:39,570 --> 00:19:41,283
evidence of that Thunderbird.

283
00:19:41,283 --> 00:19:43,667
In fact, I wanted to talk
to you about a theory

284
00:19:43,667 --> 00:19:45,853
I have about its hunting method.

285
00:19:45,853 --> 00:19:49,022
Well, Bigsby, nice of
you to finally join us.

286
00:19:49,022 --> 00:19:51,550
How about this lovely
weather I got going for us?

287
00:19:51,550 --> 00:19:53,059
- Hey, Lester.

288
00:19:53,059 --> 00:19:55,272
- We were just going over our route.

289
00:19:55,272 --> 00:19:56,135
- [Bigsby] Is that so?

290
00:19:56,135 --> 00:19:57,256
- Yeah.

291
00:19:57,256 --> 00:19:59,363
- You don't need none of that.

292
00:19:59,363 --> 00:20:01,299
Maps, GPSs, phones, any of that.

293
00:20:01,299 --> 00:20:02,718
Don't worry about none of that.

294
00:20:02,718 --> 00:20:06,355
- Well it could come in handy
if there's an emergency.

295
00:20:06,355 --> 00:20:08,409
- Phone ain’t gonna do you no good.

296
00:20:08,409 --> 00:20:11,597
It's not like we got any
kinda signal out here.

297
00:20:11,597 --> 00:20:14,486
- [Lester] Well I think we're
gonna bring our phones anyway,

298
00:20:14,486 --> 00:20:15,819
just to be safe.

299
00:20:17,223 --> 00:20:18,787
- Okay, Lester.

300
00:20:18,787 --> 00:20:23,154
- Hey, man, so you really
think we'll run into a bear?

301
00:20:23,154 --> 00:20:26,073
- Oh, hell yeah, there's all
kinds of things out here.

302
00:20:26,073 --> 00:20:27,657
There's black bears.

303
00:20:27,657 --> 00:20:29,407
There's coyotes, elk.

304
00:20:30,482 --> 00:20:32,716
Bald eagles, hawks.

305
00:20:32,716 --> 00:20:35,074
Rattlers, copperheads.

306
00:20:35,074 --> 00:20:37,678
Hell, I've seen all
kinds of things out here.

307
00:20:37,678 --> 00:20:41,678
Except some kind of a
giant, flying lizard bird.

308
00:20:43,657 --> 00:20:46,727
- Well, let's hope that's
the one thing we do find.

309
00:20:46,727 --> 00:20:49,641
- Oh, you better bet it's
plenty dangerous out here.

310
00:20:49,641 --> 00:20:51,383
And you best use your brains while you're

311
00:20:51,383 --> 00:20:52,926
out here in the wild.

312
00:20:52,926 --> 00:20:55,820
You're liable to lose them.

313
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:57,609
You ever seen brains, Lester,

314
00:20:57,609 --> 00:20:59,367
sticking out the top part of the skull?

315
00:20:59,367 --> 00:21:03,357
When the whole top part's
been bit clean off?

316
00:21:03,357 --> 00:21:05,613
- I can't say that I have.

317
00:21:05,613 --> 00:21:08,301
- Nah, you don't gotta worry about that.

318
00:21:08,301 --> 00:21:10,947
Well come on, y'all, we best get going.

319
00:21:10,947 --> 00:21:14,614
We don't wanna lose sunlight
before we get to campsite.

320
00:21:14,614 --> 00:21:15,922
- That's right, that's right.

321
00:21:15,922 --> 00:21:18,467
Everybody gather up your
stuff and let's get going.

322
00:21:18,467 --> 00:21:19,300
Chop chop.

323
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:22,536
- [James] That guy is creepy?

324
00:21:22,536 --> 00:21:25,576
- Creepy? Nah, man, spiders are creepy.

325
00:21:25,576 --> 00:21:28,102
That guy is fucking terrifying.

326
00:21:28,102 --> 00:21:31,269
(soft dramatic music)

327
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:01,833
(rain pelting)

328
00:22:10,169 --> 00:22:13,502
- Well, let's, let's wait for everybody.

329
00:22:15,261 --> 00:22:17,525
Oh hey, opportunity to tell you about that

330
00:22:17,525 --> 00:22:19,648
hunting method I was talking to you about.

331
00:22:19,648 --> 00:22:21,613
I don't think actually it would just fly

332
00:22:21,613 --> 00:22:23,497
overhead all the time.

333
00:22:23,497 --> 00:22:24,634
- Really?

334
00:22:24,634 --> 00:22:25,823
- No, I think it would be too hard

335
00:22:25,823 --> 00:22:29,306
to spot prey from above
the canopy, you know.

336
00:22:29,306 --> 00:22:33,264
- So you think it's more
like the bird of prey?

337
00:22:33,264 --> 00:22:35,898
Diving between the trees?

338
00:22:35,898 --> 00:22:37,148
- Sorta, sorta.

339
00:22:38,058 --> 00:22:40,202
- But with such a big wingspan.

340
00:22:40,202 --> 00:22:43,039
- What I mean is, you
know, I think it would be

341
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:44,739
in the trees and watch.

342
00:22:44,739 --> 00:22:46,182
Then it would swoop down and stalk

343
00:22:46,182 --> 00:22:49,103
its prey on the forest floor.

344
00:22:49,103 --> 00:22:51,988
Oh, they're all here. Let's move on then.

345
00:22:51,988 --> 00:22:53,126
Good, good.

346
00:22:53,126 --> 00:22:55,825
(rain pelting)

347
00:22:55,825 --> 00:22:58,992
(soft dramatic music)

348
00:23:04,108 --> 00:23:04,941
- Ugh.

349
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:11,583
You all right, Horty.

350
00:23:11,583 --> 00:23:13,602
- [Horty] I'm all right.

351
00:23:13,602 --> 00:23:16,281
- [James] How you doing, Horty?

352
00:23:16,281 --> 00:23:17,198
- Managing.

353
00:23:18,319 --> 00:23:19,421
- [James] If you need us to take a break,

354
00:23:19,421 --> 00:23:21,789
you just let us know.

355
00:23:21,789 --> 00:23:24,953
- I've hiked before. I'm straight.

356
00:23:24,953 --> 00:23:26,665
It's fucking raining.

357
00:23:26,665 --> 00:23:29,763
(soft dramatic music)

358
00:23:29,763 --> 00:23:32,346
(rain pelting)

359
00:23:57,743 --> 00:24:00,993
(dramatic piano music)

360
00:24:08,613 --> 00:24:09,696
- Sh, sh, sh.

361
00:24:10,681 --> 00:24:12,991
- Why did we stop?

362
00:24:12,991 --> 00:24:15,158
- Thought I saw something.

363
00:24:17,642 --> 00:24:20,719
I thought there was something
scurrying in the bushes there.

364
00:24:20,719 --> 00:24:23,106
Probably just a squirrel.

365
00:24:23,106 --> 00:24:27,018
- Likely not gonna be our bird
running through the bushes.

366
00:24:27,018 --> 00:24:28,185
- Well, maybe.

367
00:24:30,149 --> 00:24:32,874
I mean, like, okay, like
what I was talking about.

368
00:24:32,874 --> 00:24:35,733
You know, how it's up in the
trees waiting and watching,

369
00:24:35,733 --> 00:24:40,056
and then it jumps down and it
stalks its prey on all fours.

370
00:24:40,056 --> 00:24:42,473
- You think it's a quadriped?

371
00:24:43,845 --> 00:24:45,642
- Yeah, that's the word.

372
00:24:45,642 --> 00:24:47,496
I couldn't think of it in here.

373
00:24:47,496 --> 00:24:51,329
Couldn't think of the
proper entymology there.

374
00:24:52,207 --> 00:24:53,207
- Etymology.

375
00:24:55,636 --> 00:24:59,118
- [Lester] You know, I'm dyslexic.

376
00:24:59,118 --> 00:25:01,118
- How you doing, Lester?

377
00:25:02,579 --> 00:25:04,474
- [Lester] Good, we were just talking.

378
00:25:04,474 --> 00:25:06,093
- I know you was just talking.

379
00:25:06,093 --> 00:25:07,843
I was just listening.

380
00:25:09,514 --> 00:25:10,978
Well, how you feeling?

381
00:25:10,978 --> 00:25:14,815
Do you maybe wanna sit
down, take a little break?

382
00:25:14,815 --> 00:25:16,398
- No, no, I'm fine.

383
00:25:17,384 --> 00:25:19,338
I think we should move on.

384
00:25:19,338 --> 00:25:20,754
- I think that's real good, Lester.

385
00:25:20,754 --> 00:25:22,921
I think we should move on.

386
00:25:24,409 --> 00:25:25,492
- Okay, then.

387
00:25:26,409 --> 00:25:29,765
Let's move on, people. Let's move on.

388
00:25:29,765 --> 00:25:30,687
Come on.

389
00:25:30,687 --> 00:25:33,781
(rain falling)

390
00:25:33,781 --> 00:25:36,948
(soft dramatic music)

391
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:53,083
Oh.

392
00:25:54,411 --> 00:25:57,798
This field, right in
the middle of the woods.

393
00:25:57,798 --> 00:25:58,731
Honey?

394
00:25:58,731 --> 00:26:01,148
- Oh my God, this is perfect.

395
00:26:03,707 --> 00:26:06,356
I want the camera set up over there.

396
00:26:06,356 --> 00:26:10,091
- Daylight's wasting. We
need to keep marching.

397
00:26:10,091 --> 00:26:11,643
- Let's get some establishing shots,

398
00:26:11,643 --> 00:26:14,226
then I'm gonna do my monologue.

399
00:26:17,547 --> 00:26:18,964
- That's reality.

400
00:26:20,265 --> 00:26:21,893
Ooh, check that out.

401
00:26:21,893 --> 00:26:24,476
(rain pelting)

402
00:26:27,179 --> 00:26:29,737
This lake would be an
excellent sustainable

403
00:26:29,737 --> 00:26:31,685
food source for the creature.

404
00:26:31,685 --> 00:26:35,790
I totally can imagine it
coming down to snatch up fish.

405
00:26:35,790 --> 00:26:39,811
- That's a lot of energy
used just to catch a fish.

406
00:26:39,811 --> 00:26:43,141
- I mean, I'm talking
about it would scoop up

407
00:26:43,141 --> 00:26:45,269
whole schools of fish, you know.

408
00:26:45,269 --> 00:26:46,519
Like whales do.

409
00:26:47,381 --> 00:26:49,083
- [Clarissa] Honey, you're in the shot.

410
00:26:49,083 --> 00:26:50,500
- Oh, sorry, hon.

411
00:26:53,456 --> 00:26:56,741
- So you believe in all
this Thunderbird nonsense?

412
00:26:56,741 --> 00:26:59,189
- I don't give a shit.

413
00:26:59,189 --> 00:27:01,106
- A job's a job, right?

414
00:27:02,478 --> 00:27:04,228
- Long as I get paid.

415
00:27:05,503 --> 00:27:08,323
- Did you hear about all
those TV shows they've done?

416
00:27:08,323 --> 00:27:09,906
- I don't watch TV.

417
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:15,936
- You have to light the
right side of my face.

418
00:27:15,936 --> 00:27:17,436
It's my best side.

419
00:27:18,325 --> 00:27:21,199
- Hon, we can only work
with what we've got.

420
00:27:21,199 --> 00:27:24,080
- One more take, let's go.

421
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:25,330
- Okay, and ...

422
00:27:26,997 --> 00:27:28,939
- It's been theorized
that freshwater sources,

423
00:27:28,939 --> 00:27:32,005
like this lake, provide
plenty of opportunities

424
00:27:32,005 --> 00:27:35,120
for the Thunderbird to
fish, as well as attracting

425
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:39,147
larger prey as it drinks from the shore.

426
00:27:39,147 --> 00:27:40,400
Cut.

427
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:41,859
Let me see.

428
00:27:41,859 --> 00:27:43,192
Get some b-roll.

429
00:27:45,995 --> 00:27:47,893
It's been theorized
that freshwater sources,

430
00:27:47,893 --> 00:27:50,783
like this lake, provide
plenty of opportunities

431
00:27:50,783 --> 00:27:53,690
for the Thunderbird to
fish, as well as attracting

432
00:27:53,690 --> 00:27:57,290
larger prey as it drinks from the shore.

433
00:27:57,290 --> 00:27:58,757
Cut.

434
00:27:58,757 --> 00:28:00,176
Let me see.

435
00:28:00,176 --> 00:28:01,009
No, no.

436
00:28:02,026 --> 00:28:03,131
No.

437
00:28:03,131 --> 00:28:03,964
No, no.

438
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:08,633
- Well, I mean we can
brighten it up in post.

439
00:28:08,633 --> 00:28:10,000
- The lighting is off.

440
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,061
How can you not see how bad that looks?

441
00:28:13,061 --> 00:28:14,683
- I thought it looked all right.

442
00:28:14,683 --> 00:28:16,516
I mean you look, good.

443
00:28:17,872 --> 00:28:19,589
- I don't wanna look good.

444
00:28:19,589 --> 00:28:22,172
I want to look fucking amazing!

445
00:28:23,061 --> 00:28:26,363
Fuck it, get the bounce board.

446
00:28:26,363 --> 00:28:28,419
- We don't have a bounce board.

447
00:28:28,419 --> 00:28:31,483
And, what good would it do anyway?

448
00:28:31,483 --> 00:28:33,200
- [Clarissa] What?

449
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,748
- We were never told to bring one.

450
00:28:35,748 --> 00:28:38,734
- Wait wait wait, you
didn't bring a bounce board

451
00:28:38,734 --> 00:28:40,763
because you weren't told
to bring a bounce board?

452
00:28:40,763 --> 00:28:43,360
Is that what you're saying?

453
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:45,182
- That's just about the gist of it.

454
00:28:45,182 --> 00:28:46,682
- Huh, okay, okay.

455
00:28:47,547 --> 00:28:49,499
I didn't tell you to bring
any toilet paper, either.

456
00:28:49,499 --> 00:28:51,600
You planning on wiping
your ass in the grass?

457
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,791
- Okay, okay, look, there was nothing

458
00:28:53,791 --> 00:28:56,555
in the contract about
bringing a bounce board.

459
00:28:56,555 --> 00:28:58,320
- Goddam dumb motherfuckers.

460
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:01,095
- Okay, there is no
need for that language.

461
00:29:01,095 --> 00:29:02,848
- [Clarissa] Lester!

462
00:29:02,848 --> 00:29:04,528
- Oh my God, this is fucking ridiculous.

463
00:29:04,528 --> 00:29:05,605
- [Clarissa] Lester!

464
00:29:05,605 --> 00:29:09,028
- [Lester] I'm right here. What's wrong?

465
00:29:09,028 --> 00:29:11,518
- What the hell are we
paying these amateurs for?

466
00:29:11,518 --> 00:29:12,507
- Jesus Christ.

467
00:29:12,507 --> 00:29:14,366
- Well, what's wrong?

468
00:29:14,366 --> 00:29:16,199
- The footage is shit.

469
00:29:17,733 --> 00:29:18,733
- Oh, right.

470
00:29:19,781 --> 00:29:21,237
You know what, honey.

471
00:29:21,237 --> 00:29:23,770
We can get this shot on
the way back, all right.

472
00:29:23,770 --> 00:29:27,552
There'll be more light. It'll
make you even more beautiful.

473
00:29:27,552 --> 00:29:28,385
Okay?

474
00:29:29,531 --> 00:29:31,193
Okay?

475
00:29:31,193 --> 00:29:32,026
- Fine.

476
00:29:33,979 --> 00:29:36,672
- Hey, Lester, we need to get moving.

477
00:29:36,672 --> 00:29:38,629
It's gonna be dark soon.

478
00:29:38,629 --> 00:29:41,182
- You're right, Bigsby.
Let's wrap it up, people.

479
00:29:41,182 --> 00:29:42,777
And get on with it.

480
00:29:42,777 --> 00:29:45,944
(soft dramatic music)

481
00:30:26,671 --> 00:30:29,706
- [Horty] Fucking hell, man.

482
00:30:29,706 --> 00:30:31,722
- So, Afghanistan, huh?

483
00:30:31,722 --> 00:30:33,013
- [James] Yeah.

484
00:30:33,013 --> 00:30:34,346
- Rough terrain?

485
00:30:35,416 --> 00:30:38,149
- The land that God forgot.

486
00:30:38,149 --> 00:30:42,735
- Hey, man, you got any ointment
or bandages or something?

487
00:30:42,735 --> 00:30:43,672
- [James] Yeah, sure.

488
00:30:43,672 --> 00:30:46,029
- Here, tear you off a piece of that.

489
00:30:46,029 --> 00:30:47,455
Wrap it around your foot.

490
00:30:47,455 --> 00:30:51,705
And next time you wear
boots, not basketball shoes.

491
00:30:52,825 --> 00:30:53,658
- Pass.

492
00:30:54,511 --> 00:30:57,326
I don't think there's
gonna be a next time.

493
00:30:57,326 --> 00:31:01,055
- Here, put these on
overnight, and you can wear

494
00:31:01,055 --> 00:31:05,021
the bandages on your feet
under your shoes for tomorrow.

495
00:31:05,021 --> 00:31:06,789
- Thanks, man.

496
00:31:06,789 --> 00:31:10,802
- So it musta been tough
being a medic in the Army.

497
00:31:10,802 --> 00:31:11,635
- Yeah.

498
00:31:12,472 --> 00:31:15,375
- Bet you've seen worse
than Horty's blisters.

499
00:31:15,375 --> 00:31:16,542
- [James] Yep.

500
00:31:17,854 --> 00:31:21,781
- What was the worst thing, you think?

501
00:31:21,781 --> 00:31:25,652
- The hardest thing was
putting soldiers down.

502
00:31:25,652 --> 00:31:27,535
You know, when they were so badly injured

503
00:31:27,535 --> 00:31:32,477
and we didn't have the time
or resources to help them.

504
00:31:32,477 --> 00:31:35,507
And sometimes we didn't even have drugs.

505
00:31:35,507 --> 00:31:39,514
So we'd use whatever we
could to help make it easier.

506
00:31:39,514 --> 00:31:44,117
And, they would be so out
of it, and begging for it,

507
00:31:44,117 --> 00:31:48,734
that we'd tell them, whether
they could hear us or not,

508
00:31:48,734 --> 00:31:53,151
that there was good grub waiting
for them on the other side.

509
00:31:53,151 --> 00:31:56,509
All they had to do was count to 10.

510
00:31:56,509 --> 00:32:00,759
And then we'd count to 10
and then, they'd be gone.

511
00:32:02,596 --> 00:32:06,263
(soft dramatic piano music)

512
00:32:10,091 --> 00:32:12,674
(rain falling)

513
00:32:18,630 --> 00:32:21,394
- [Clarissa] Oh God, it's a
bear! My God, it's a bear!

514
00:32:21,394 --> 00:32:23,696
- [Bigsby] No bear, that's a false alarm.

515
00:32:23,696 --> 00:32:25,115
There ain’t no bear.

516
00:32:25,115 --> 00:32:28,208
- Why the fuck would you yell bear?

517
00:32:28,208 --> 00:32:29,666
- I saw it.

518
00:32:29,666 --> 00:32:31,136
- You did?

519
00:32:31,136 --> 00:32:32,370
- [Lester] It was huge.

520
00:32:32,370 --> 00:32:36,295
I mean, I didn't get a good
look, but it was right above us.

521
00:32:36,295 --> 00:32:37,343
- A bear?

522
00:32:37,343 --> 00:32:40,146
- What? No, the Thunderbird.

523
00:32:40,146 --> 00:32:41,308
- Oh, Christ.

524
00:32:41,308 --> 00:32:42,418
- [Reid] You have got to be shitting me.

525
00:32:42,418 --> 00:32:44,940
- It was right up in the
trees, just like I thought,

526
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:46,599
just like I theorized.

527
00:32:46,599 --> 00:32:48,800
- Oh my God, my fucking heart.

528
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:52,092
- It flew off that way.
We have to follow it.

529
00:32:52,092 --> 00:32:55,239
- [Bigsby] We aren't
following shit in this dark.

530
00:32:55,239 --> 00:32:57,239
- But I saw it.

531
00:32:57,239 --> 00:33:00,327
I mean, we shoulda had the cameras on.

532
00:33:00,327 --> 00:33:02,494
We shoulda been recording.

533
00:33:04,396 --> 00:33:07,520
- Of all the things, you coulda shouted,

534
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:09,367
why did you have to shout bear?

535
00:33:09,367 --> 00:33:11,691
- Because it looked
like a bear, it's dark.

536
00:33:11,691 --> 00:33:12,854
I'm sorry.

537
00:33:12,854 --> 00:33:15,607
- Still, that's pretty
irresponsible, though.

538
00:33:15,607 --> 00:33:18,012
- By dawn's light, we are
heading off in that direction.

539
00:33:18,012 --> 00:33:20,844
The nest has got to be in that direction.

540
00:33:20,844 --> 00:33:23,767
- Lester, I think you
need to get some sleep.

541
00:33:23,767 --> 00:33:27,138
And we are not going off the trail.

542
00:33:27,138 --> 00:33:30,434
- If it went that way, that's where we go.

543
00:33:30,434 --> 00:33:32,434
- [Reid] Did anyone else hear anything?

544
00:33:32,434 --> 00:33:36,140
- Well, I can't be accountable
for what might happen

545
00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:38,380
to y'all if we go off the trail.

546
00:33:38,380 --> 00:33:42,117
- But we have to find
the nest. We've got to.

547
00:33:42,117 --> 00:33:44,617
- Okay, Lester, if you say so.

548
00:33:46,834 --> 00:33:48,917
But not till first light.

549
00:33:51,431 --> 00:33:55,514
I think the rest of y'all
need to get some sleep.

550
00:33:58,839 --> 00:33:59,672
- Great.

551
00:34:00,572 --> 00:34:03,322
If it's a bear, we could all die.

552
00:34:04,610 --> 00:34:07,115
- [Reid] Let's get some sleep.

553
00:34:07,115 --> 00:34:09,644
- I fucking hate the woods, man.

554
00:34:09,644 --> 00:34:12,811
(soft dramatic music)

555
00:34:24,690 --> 00:34:26,951
- I think we should have a shot

556
00:34:26,951 --> 00:34:29,639
where the camera glides between the trees.

557
00:34:29,639 --> 00:34:31,341
- You're not serious?

558
00:34:31,341 --> 00:34:33,741
- The Thunderbird flies
between the trees, right?

559
00:34:33,741 --> 00:34:36,210
So I wanna replicate that with a sequence

560
00:34:36,210 --> 00:34:39,282
from the creature's point of view.

561
00:34:39,282 --> 00:34:42,599
- Uh, hon, we ain’t got no drone.

562
00:34:42,599 --> 00:34:43,432
- So?

563
00:34:44,466 --> 00:34:49,466
- So it's kinda something
that we can't really pull off.

564
00:34:49,777 --> 00:34:52,545
- Well, if you looked at your contract,

565
00:34:52,545 --> 00:34:55,378
you'd have noticed a teeny
tiny clause that states

566
00:34:55,378 --> 00:34:58,077
that if I request a
shot, you have to give me

567
00:34:58,077 --> 00:35:01,810
that shot to the best of your ability!

568
00:35:01,810 --> 00:35:04,941
- Well, I think making
the camera fly might be

569
00:35:04,941 --> 00:35:08,363
a little bit beyond our ability.

570
00:35:08,363 --> 00:35:09,196
- Lester!

571
00:35:10,215 --> 00:35:12,263
- God, here we go.

572
00:35:12,263 --> 00:35:14,199
- Lester.
- Yeah.

573
00:35:14,199 --> 00:35:16,038
- These fucking amateurs, these nobodies,

574
00:35:16,038 --> 00:35:18,167
they're getting on my last nerve.

575
00:35:18,167 --> 00:35:21,031
- This isn't the sorta
shit that we signed up for.

576
00:35:21,031 --> 00:35:23,132
- They're in violation of their contract.

577
00:35:23,132 --> 00:35:27,820
- Well, just wait. Everybody
take a breath, okay?

578
00:35:27,820 --> 00:35:30,316
Horty, what's the problem?

579
00:35:30,316 --> 00:35:35,154
- The problem is we can't do
what's physically impossible.

580
00:35:35,154 --> 00:35:38,700
- She wants a shot of the camera
gliding through the trees.

581
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:41,533
- To simulate the Thunderbird POV.

582
00:35:43,322 --> 00:35:45,708
- That's a great idea.

583
00:35:45,708 --> 00:35:47,765
You just use a drone.

584
00:35:47,765 --> 00:35:51,463
- We didn't bring a fucking drone, did we?

585
00:35:51,463 --> 00:35:52,572
- This is ridiculous.

586
00:35:52,572 --> 00:35:54,784
- No no no, now now, I hired you guys

587
00:35:54,784 --> 00:35:56,754
because you're the best and
the brightest in the business,

588
00:35:56,754 --> 00:35:58,583
right, so what we're
gonna do, we're gonna put

589
00:35:58,583 --> 00:36:01,537
our heads together,
we're gonna solve this.

590
00:36:01,537 --> 00:36:03,527
- [Reid] What do you expect us to do?

591
00:36:03,527 --> 00:36:06,993
- We'll rig something up,
you know, MacGyver something.

592
00:36:06,993 --> 00:36:08,636
We got all that climbing equipment.

593
00:36:08,636 --> 00:36:10,779
We got ropes, we got pulleys.

594
00:36:10,779 --> 00:36:13,884
- No, nope, that's a
accident waiting to happen.

595
00:36:13,884 --> 00:36:14,972
I'm telling you.

596
00:36:14,972 --> 00:36:16,630
- Think about it.

597
00:36:16,630 --> 00:36:19,718
We string a rope between two
trees, right, on an angle.

598
00:36:19,718 --> 00:36:23,036
And then we can hook the
camera into a harness

599
00:36:23,036 --> 00:36:24,839
and then just let it zip along.

600
00:36:24,839 --> 00:36:28,187
- It's gonna crash right
into the tree trunk.

601
00:36:28,187 --> 00:36:31,415
- So what we do is, we hook a rope

602
00:36:31,415 --> 00:36:33,832
to the bottom, to control it.

603
00:36:40,540 --> 00:36:41,873
- It could work.

604
00:36:42,898 --> 00:36:47,367
- Well, whatever y'all
do, best be doing it soon.

605
00:36:47,367 --> 00:36:50,295
We're in bear country now.

606
00:36:50,295 --> 00:36:53,212
- Really? You just had to say that?

607
00:36:54,049 --> 00:36:55,466
- Come on, Horty.

608
00:36:58,822 --> 00:37:01,572
- Well all right. Problem solved.

609
00:37:02,636 --> 00:37:04,727
- [Reid] All right, we gotta do it easy.

610
00:37:04,727 --> 00:37:06,087
- [Clarissa] You have to cut the slack.

611
00:37:06,087 --> 00:37:07,170
- Easy, easy.

612
00:37:08,778 --> 00:37:10,396
- [Clarissa] You have to cut the slack.

613
00:37:10,396 --> 00:37:13,028
- [Lester] I'm trying.

614
00:37:13,028 --> 00:37:15,010
- [Clarissa] Cut that slack.

615
00:37:15,010 --> 00:37:17,927
- I'll fucking do it, if you quit...

616
00:37:19,853 --> 00:37:22,734
- [Clarissa] You broke it.

617
00:37:22,734 --> 00:37:24,669
- Son of a bitch, man!

618
00:37:24,669 --> 00:37:27,139
- You fucking broke it!

619
00:37:27,139 --> 00:37:28,647
- [Reid] Dammit, I told you
it wouldn't fucking work.

620
00:37:28,647 --> 00:37:29,623
- I told you.
- It's Horty's fault.

621
00:37:29,623 --> 00:37:31,091
- What?

622
00:37:31,091 --> 00:37:35,353
- You fucking, okay,
okay, moron, all right?

623
00:37:35,353 --> 00:37:38,398
Thick, empty-headed, piss
and shit swimming around

624
00:37:38,398 --> 00:37:40,668
in that hollow fucking skull of yours.

625
00:37:40,668 --> 00:37:41,726
- I'm not doing this, man.

626
00:37:41,726 --> 00:37:42,750
- Honey, please.

627
00:37:42,750 --> 00:37:44,755
- No, do you know what he's cost us?

628
00:37:44,755 --> 00:37:46,254
Do you know what your
fucking butterfingers

629
00:37:46,254 --> 00:37:47,976
has cost this production?

630
00:37:47,976 --> 00:37:50,493
You ignorant, goddam, motherfuck...

631
00:37:50,493 --> 00:37:51,660
- Oh fuck off!

632
00:37:52,531 --> 00:37:54,361
That was our camera that you made us

633
00:37:54,361 --> 00:37:56,147
put up in the fucking tree!

634
00:37:56,147 --> 00:37:58,883
And you telling me that it cost you?

635
00:37:58,883 --> 00:38:00,915
Are you insane?

636
00:38:00,915 --> 00:38:03,331
Well fuck you, lady. I'm outta here.

637
00:38:03,331 --> 00:38:04,718
- [Lester] Horty, please.

638
00:38:04,718 --> 00:38:07,388
- No, sorry, Les. I'm done, man.

639
00:38:07,388 --> 00:38:09,730
- So what, you think you're quitting?

640
00:38:09,730 --> 00:38:11,479
- You fucking bet I'm quitting.

641
00:38:11,479 --> 00:38:13,598
And you paying us back
for that camera, too.

642
00:38:13,598 --> 00:38:15,577
- I'm not paying for shit.

643
00:38:15,577 --> 00:38:17,363
- Oh, you're fucking paying.

644
00:38:17,363 --> 00:38:19,598
I'm sorry, Lester, but
she is out of control.

645
00:38:19,598 --> 00:38:22,226
- [Lester] Okay, guys,
please, can we relax a minute?

646
00:38:22,226 --> 00:38:24,977
- Nope, it's over. I'm done.

647
00:38:24,977 --> 00:38:26,611
- [Lester] Horty, please, come on.

648
00:38:26,611 --> 00:38:28,622
- Dude, fucking forest, man.

649
00:38:28,622 --> 00:38:30,622
Bugs and shit everywhere.

650
00:38:30,622 --> 00:38:32,942
Les, I got blisters on my toes.

651
00:38:32,942 --> 00:38:35,214
- [Reid] Horty, you're not
walking back by yourself.

652
00:38:35,214 --> 00:38:37,347
- I thought this was supposed
to be a walk in the woods,

653
00:38:37,347 --> 00:38:39,014
not Lewis and fucking Clark.

654
00:38:39,014 --> 00:38:42,278
- I get it's a setback, but
we can bounce back from this.

655
00:38:42,278 --> 00:38:45,517
- Dude, I got that
bitch in my ear all day.

656
00:38:45,517 --> 00:38:49,350
I don't need it, man. I
don't fucking need it.

657
00:38:50,670 --> 00:38:51,753
- Hey, Horty.

658
00:38:53,353 --> 00:38:56,716
How you doing, Horty? Not good, huh?

659
00:38:56,716 --> 00:38:58,105
Not too good at all.

660
00:38:58,105 --> 00:39:01,527
You're not always gonna
feel good out here.

661
00:39:01,527 --> 00:39:05,897
You know, I don't think
you like it out here.

662
00:39:05,897 --> 00:39:08,174
I don't think you're made for it.

663
00:39:08,174 --> 00:39:11,096
But you know, that's okay.

664
00:39:11,096 --> 00:39:14,825
Hell's fire, I ain’t made
for a whole lot of shit.

665
00:39:14,825 --> 00:39:17,408
And I like you. Like you a lot.

666
00:39:18,793 --> 00:39:23,047
I just didn't think we'd be
saying goodbye quite so soon.

667
00:39:23,047 --> 00:39:27,134
Do you have any mind as
to where you're headed,

668
00:39:27,134 --> 00:39:28,551
how to get there?

669
00:39:30,359 --> 00:39:33,890
You know, a lot of
folks, if they were lost

670
00:39:33,890 --> 00:39:37,890
way out here, all alone,
with bears and coyotes,

671
00:39:41,246 --> 00:39:42,246
scary, dude.

672
00:39:44,233 --> 00:39:45,900
Just think about it.

673
00:39:55,266 --> 00:39:56,766
- Honey, I get it.

674
00:39:57,613 --> 00:40:01,048
People make me crazy all the time, too.

675
00:40:01,048 --> 00:40:04,088
But, you can't treat people like that,

676
00:40:04,088 --> 00:40:06,171
talk to them like that.

677
00:40:06,171 --> 00:40:09,889
They're not gonna wanna stay on your team.

678
00:40:09,889 --> 00:40:14,600
Like it or not, these
folks, they are our team.

679
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:17,842
Without them, we got no show.

680
00:40:17,842 --> 00:40:18,675
Okay?

681
00:40:24,402 --> 00:40:25,235
Okay.

682
00:40:28,679 --> 00:40:31,846
(soft dramatic music)

683
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,583
(rain falling)

684
00:41:09,843 --> 00:41:12,002
- My toe hurts, man.

685
00:41:12,002 --> 00:41:13,897
- You ever lug this much stuff around?

686
00:41:13,897 --> 00:41:15,571
- Not like this.

687
00:41:15,571 --> 00:41:17,628
- How's your back?

688
00:41:17,628 --> 00:41:19,139
- It's been better.

689
00:41:19,139 --> 00:41:21,542
- Well here, let's stretch you out.

690
00:41:21,542 --> 00:41:22,625
- Okay, okay.

691
00:41:25,762 --> 00:41:27,714
- [James] Yeah, people underestimate

692
00:41:27,714 --> 00:41:29,417
the importance of stretching.

693
00:41:29,417 --> 00:41:31,427
- Let me grab this first.

694
00:41:31,427 --> 00:41:34,419
(rain pelting)

695
00:41:34,419 --> 00:41:36,241
You know, this isn't the sorta shit

696
00:41:36,241 --> 00:41:39,070
that we signed up for, me and Horty.

697
00:41:39,070 --> 00:41:41,653
(rain pelting)

698
00:41:42,873 --> 00:41:44,339
- I really wish that they would act like

699
00:41:44,339 --> 00:41:46,077
the experts that they claim to be.

700
00:41:46,077 --> 00:41:48,317
- Yeah, they're so unprofessional.

701
00:41:48,317 --> 00:41:50,633
And that girl, that woman, oh God.

702
00:41:50,633 --> 00:41:52,435
She's just driving me up a wall.

703
00:41:52,435 --> 00:41:54,339
Like, I just, I can't with her, I can't.

704
00:41:54,339 --> 00:41:56,529
She's barking orders at us
like we're, I don't even,

705
00:41:56,529 --> 00:41:58,393
I don't even, I just.

706
00:41:58,393 --> 00:42:01,459
You know what, I bet they're
not even gonna pay us.

707
00:42:01,459 --> 00:42:03,961
- Well with the rain and
everything, if they don't pay us,

708
00:42:03,961 --> 00:42:06,862
they're gonna have some really
angry people coming at them.

709
00:42:06,862 --> 00:42:08,798
- They're gonna have a
lawsuit coming at them.

710
00:42:08,798 --> 00:42:10,137
They're gonna have lawyers.

711
00:42:10,137 --> 00:42:13,356
They're gonna have a mob of
people coming after them.

712
00:42:13,356 --> 00:42:17,273
They're just, mark my
words, it's gonna happen.

713
00:42:19,969 --> 00:42:21,228
- Is Horty okay?

714
00:42:21,228 --> 00:42:23,073
- I don't even know where he went.

715
00:42:23,073 --> 00:42:25,764
I thought I saw him running
out in the distance.

716
00:42:25,764 --> 00:42:27,758
- No, probably not.

717
00:42:27,758 --> 00:42:30,057
He was complaining about his
stomach hurting, I think.

718
00:42:30,057 --> 00:42:31,908
- Yeah, I gotta keep an eye on that guy.

719
00:42:31,908 --> 00:42:33,805
I don't think he's built for this.

720
00:42:33,805 --> 00:42:36,388
- Oh, no, he is definitely not.

721
00:42:37,652 --> 00:42:42,280
I was talking to his mom
right before we came out here,

722
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:45,249
and she told me that about three years ago

723
00:42:45,249 --> 00:42:47,988
he got beat up by this little
girl on the playground.

724
00:42:47,988 --> 00:42:50,137
Hasn't been the same since.

725
00:42:50,137 --> 00:42:51,444
- [James] Wow, three years?

726
00:42:51,444 --> 00:42:53,785
- Yeah, it was three years
ago, can you believe it?

727
00:42:53,785 --> 00:42:56,355
- Wow, so how does
something like that happen?

728
00:42:56,355 --> 00:42:59,849
- Oh, well, she said that
he was walking his dog,

729
00:42:59,849 --> 00:43:02,749
like this little Pomeranian princess,

730
00:43:02,749 --> 00:43:05,182
and he was walking her, and
then he saw a little girl

731
00:43:05,182 --> 00:43:07,331
on the swing set, and being
the good person that Horty is,

732
00:43:07,331 --> 00:43:09,154
went to go over to push her.

733
00:43:09,154 --> 00:43:11,873
And then she was having
a good time, like, woo,

734
00:43:11,873 --> 00:43:14,062
and then she got off and just like turned.

735
00:43:14,062 --> 00:43:15,660
You know how he always
wears basketball shorts

736
00:43:15,660 --> 00:43:18,548
and basketball shoes, well,
yanked his pants down,

737
00:43:18,548 --> 00:43:20,393
punched him in the nuts.

738
00:43:20,393 --> 00:43:22,449
He fell over, screaming.

739
00:43:22,449 --> 00:43:25,022
Well, the little Pomeranian
turned on him too

740
00:43:25,022 --> 00:43:27,324
and started yapping at his ankles.

741
00:43:27,324 --> 00:43:29,582
And then she started
knocking him in the nose.

742
00:43:29,582 --> 00:43:32,749
And you know when you say it out loud,

743
00:43:33,774 --> 00:43:36,260
does sound so rough, doesn't it?

744
00:43:36,260 --> 00:43:38,898
- Uh, well, yeah, I guess that sounds like

745
00:43:38,898 --> 00:43:41,193
a pretty traumatizing experience.

746
00:43:41,193 --> 00:43:45,175
- Yeah, well, you live
and you learn, right.

747
00:43:45,175 --> 00:43:47,758
(rain falling)

748
00:43:48,717 --> 00:43:51,550
(birds whistling)

749
00:43:53,106 --> 00:43:56,259
(inhaling and exhaling)

750
00:43:56,259 --> 00:43:58,696
- Can you smell that?

751
00:43:58,696 --> 00:44:00,668
You know what that is?

752
00:44:00,668 --> 00:44:02,798
That's the smell of Thunderbird.

753
00:44:02,798 --> 00:44:05,298
That's what that is, yes, sir.

754
00:44:07,809 --> 00:44:10,559
(birds chirping)

755
00:44:12,942 --> 00:44:15,321
(screaming)

756
00:44:15,321 --> 00:44:16,441
- Are you okay?

757
00:44:16,441 --> 00:44:17,838
- Ow, ow, fuck.

758
00:44:17,838 --> 00:44:18,671
No.

759
00:44:18,671 --> 00:44:19,504
- Where are your hurt?

760
00:44:19,504 --> 00:44:21,532
- Oh, fuck, it's cramping,
man, it's cramping.

761
00:44:21,532 --> 00:44:22,365
Ow.

762
00:44:22,365 --> 00:44:24,041
- Throw that off, throw that off.

763
00:44:24,041 --> 00:44:25,550
All right.

764
00:44:25,550 --> 00:44:27,422
So where it is on your leg?

765
00:44:27,422 --> 00:44:28,537
- It's my ankle, my ankle.

766
00:44:28,537 --> 00:44:29,370
- Okay.

767
00:44:30,281 --> 00:44:31,972
- Oh my God, ow.

768
00:44:31,972 --> 00:44:34,836
God, this is too fucking much, man.

769
00:44:34,836 --> 00:44:36,856
- Can you walk?

770
00:44:36,856 --> 00:44:37,689
- Of course I can walk.

771
00:44:37,689 --> 00:44:39,715
I'm not no cripple. I just can't ...

772
00:44:39,715 --> 00:44:41,581
- Easy, easy.

773
00:44:41,581 --> 00:44:45,177
Well, it doesn't look
like a sprained ankle.

774
00:44:45,177 --> 00:44:48,088
- It's not a sprained ankle.
It just fucking hurts.

775
00:44:48,088 --> 00:44:51,528
- Yeah, possibly a stress fracture.

776
00:44:51,528 --> 00:44:52,611
- Oh, goddam.

777
00:44:53,753 --> 00:44:55,677
- You know what, we're losing light.

778
00:44:55,677 --> 00:44:56,628
- I know we're fucking losing light.

779
00:44:56,628 --> 00:44:58,022
What are you, Big Ben?

780
00:44:58,022 --> 00:44:59,448
- I think we oughta make camp.

781
00:44:59,448 --> 00:45:01,476
- I think we oughta go home.

782
00:45:01,476 --> 00:45:02,700
- What?

783
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:05,412
- [Reid] I think it's time
we had that conversation.

784
00:45:05,412 --> 00:45:08,094
- Well for right now, I think
we should just make camp.

785
00:45:08,094 --> 00:45:10,916
- No, no, no, we cannot make camp.

786
00:45:10,916 --> 00:45:11,939
- Why not?

787
00:45:11,939 --> 00:45:15,182
- Because, we have to
keep going. We're close.

788
00:45:15,182 --> 00:45:17,758
- Is he serious right now?

789
00:45:17,758 --> 00:45:19,737
- Look, there's no way we can continue on

790
00:45:19,737 --> 00:45:22,052
with her in the condition that she's in.

791
00:45:22,052 --> 00:45:23,982
- Lester, why don't you wanna make camp?

792
00:45:23,982 --> 00:45:27,899
- Because. Because we're
close, we're so close.

793
00:45:28,809 --> 00:45:30,872
- [Bigsby] Oh, are we close, Lester?

794
00:45:30,872 --> 00:45:32,910
- Yes, I can feel it.

795
00:45:32,910 --> 00:45:34,873
Now we haven't gotten a single
shot of the creature yet.

796
00:45:34,873 --> 00:45:37,879
And I actually saw it, so I
think we should keep going

797
00:45:37,879 --> 00:45:39,710
till we get some footage.

798
00:45:39,710 --> 00:45:41,864
- I think we should
make camp for the night

799
00:45:41,864 --> 00:45:44,233
and leave in the morning.

800
00:45:44,233 --> 00:45:45,865
- I fucking agree with that shit.

801
00:45:45,865 --> 00:45:46,985
- Yeah, me too.

802
00:45:46,985 --> 00:45:47,868
- Okay, well, you know what?

803
00:45:47,868 --> 00:45:50,694
The last time I checked, I
was the one who was footing

804
00:45:50,694 --> 00:45:52,098
the bill for this entire operation,

805
00:45:52,098 --> 00:45:54,392
so I think maybe I should be
the one who makes decisions

806
00:45:54,392 --> 00:45:56,126
about whether or not we go home or not.

807
00:45:56,126 --> 00:45:57,646
- [Reid] Why are you insisting on this?

808
00:45:57,646 --> 00:46:00,196
- Because I know what I saw,
and we gotta get it on camera

809
00:46:00,196 --> 00:46:02,613
so people finally believe me.

810
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:05,929
- Is that right, Lester?

811
00:46:05,929 --> 00:46:09,134
You saw it with your own two
eyes, that great big beast

812
00:46:09,134 --> 00:46:10,969
monster that no other ranger in these

813
00:46:10,969 --> 00:46:13,219
whole parts ever once seen?

814
00:46:14,334 --> 00:46:17,501
- We are moving on, and that is final.

815
00:46:18,670 --> 00:46:21,347
- Is that final, Lester?

816
00:46:21,347 --> 00:46:25,597
You know what, what it look
like? Big, yellow eyes?

817
00:46:26,722 --> 00:46:29,710
- You know, if none of you moves on,

818
00:46:29,710 --> 00:46:30,947
none of you is getting paid.

819
00:46:30,947 --> 00:46:32,197
How about that?

820
00:46:33,138 --> 00:46:35,149
- Y'all hear that?

821
00:46:35,149 --> 00:46:38,552
Lester says, if we don't get a moving,

822
00:46:38,552 --> 00:46:40,052
we don't get paid.

823
00:46:41,736 --> 00:46:46,286
So I guess we better get a
walking, like Lester says,

824
00:46:46,286 --> 00:46:47,896
or we don't get paid.

825
00:46:47,896 --> 00:46:50,200
Is that what you're saying, Lester?

826
00:46:50,200 --> 00:46:54,367
- Well, why don't we just
make camp for the night,

827
00:46:55,683 --> 00:46:57,875
and then we'll figure
it out in the morning?

828
00:46:57,875 --> 00:47:02,125
- Lester, I think you better
listen to your friend.

829
00:47:03,510 --> 00:47:05,203
- Clarissa.

830
00:47:05,203 --> 00:47:09,120
- We're a team. Whatever
the team wants, right?

831
00:47:12,912 --> 00:47:14,503
- Fine.

832
00:47:14,503 --> 00:47:16,230
Good, for the team.

833
00:47:16,230 --> 00:47:17,313
- Let's move.

834
00:47:24,432 --> 00:47:26,682
(groaning)

835
00:47:28,794 --> 00:47:31,961
(soft dramatic music)

836
00:47:41,845 --> 00:47:44,428
(rain pelting)

837
00:47:48,056 --> 00:47:50,943
- Make sure you guys are filming this.

838
00:47:50,943 --> 00:47:55,784
What do you guys think,
huh? Could be the creature.

839
00:47:55,784 --> 00:47:59,188
- Man, ain’t no fucking bird did this.

840
00:47:59,188 --> 00:48:02,436
- Yeah, it looks like a
dead animal or something.

841
00:48:02,436 --> 00:48:04,708
- I thought we were alone out here.

842
00:48:04,708 --> 00:48:07,555
- Oh we're alone out here.
We're plenty alone out here.

843
00:48:07,555 --> 00:48:09,257
- What is that?

844
00:48:09,257 --> 00:48:10,543
- Oh shit.

845
00:48:10,543 --> 00:48:13,210
- Let met take a gander at that.

846
00:48:15,834 --> 00:48:17,758
- [James] What the fuck is that?

847
00:48:17,758 --> 00:48:18,772
- Oh my God!

848
00:48:18,772 --> 00:48:21,522
(dramatic music)

849
00:48:22,698 --> 00:48:27,428
- You all smell that?
That's the smell of death.

850
00:48:27,428 --> 00:48:29,303
And you all woke it up.

851
00:48:29,303 --> 00:48:31,204
(gagging)

852
00:48:31,204 --> 00:48:32,727
- Holy Christ, man.

853
00:48:32,727 --> 00:48:35,570
That motherfucker's
dead as a motherfucker.

854
00:48:35,570 --> 00:48:39,122
- Yeah, looks like it's for sure human.

855
00:48:39,122 --> 00:48:41,809
And it's been dead for a long time.

856
00:48:41,809 --> 00:48:45,387
- [Kyra] Where's the rest of the body?

857
00:48:45,387 --> 00:48:48,390
- [Horty] Do we call the
cops, man? What do we do?

858
00:48:48,390 --> 00:48:51,296
- You know, you go ahead
and make that call, Horty.

859
00:48:51,296 --> 00:48:52,582
Go ahead and make that call.

860
00:48:52,582 --> 00:48:53,898
I think you're gonna find we don't have

861
00:48:53,898 --> 00:48:55,998
any kinda signal out here.

862
00:48:55,998 --> 00:48:58,468
(insects buzzing)

863
00:48:58,468 --> 00:49:01,635
Come on, y'all. We're losing daylight.

864
00:49:07,892 --> 00:49:10,475
(rain falling)

865
00:49:15,266 --> 00:49:16,514
- [Kyra] How many bodies do you think

866
00:49:16,514 --> 00:49:18,431
are buried under there?

867
00:49:19,581 --> 00:49:22,164
- [Lester] Ain't no way to know.

868
00:49:37,139 --> 00:49:40,306
(soft dramatic music)

869
00:49:53,099 --> 00:49:55,558
(animal growling)

870
00:49:55,558 --> 00:49:57,631
(woman screaming)

871
00:49:57,631 --> 00:50:00,208
(animal growling)

872
00:50:00,208 --> 00:50:01,901
(woman screaming)

873
00:50:01,901 --> 00:50:04,734
(animal growling)

874
00:50:08,340 --> 00:50:09,680
(woman screaming)

875
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:11,804
- [James] Whoa. Jesus.

876
00:50:11,804 --> 00:50:13,221
Get out of there.

877
00:50:15,074 --> 00:50:17,907
Oh, shit. Git, git, you dumb bear.

878
00:50:19,008 --> 00:50:20,425
Help me, my pack.

879
00:50:21,907 --> 00:50:23,893
(woman screaming)

880
00:50:23,893 --> 00:50:26,404
I got it, I got it, I got it.

881
00:50:26,404 --> 00:50:29,235
(hard breathing)

882
00:50:29,235 --> 00:50:31,985
(dramatic music)

883
00:50:39,429 --> 00:50:41,957
Git, git, you dumb bear.

884
00:50:41,957 --> 00:50:42,957
Oh, my pack.

885
00:50:46,517 --> 00:50:49,513
Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God.

886
00:50:49,513 --> 00:50:52,298
(animal growling)

887
00:50:52,298 --> 00:50:55,048
(dramatic music)

888
00:50:57,343 --> 00:50:58,926
- Lester, the rope?

889
00:51:00,837 --> 00:51:03,290
- Lester!
- Get the rope.

890
00:51:03,290 --> 00:51:05,207
- Lester, the rope now.

891
00:51:07,188 --> 00:51:08,367
All right, forget the rope.

892
00:51:08,367 --> 00:51:11,845
We gotta bring her back. Who's gonna help?

893
00:51:11,845 --> 00:51:14,512
Y'all smell that? I smell death.

894
00:51:15,643 --> 00:51:19,776
Bears know that smell, and
you got it all over you.

895
00:51:19,776 --> 00:51:23,585
- We need to find
something to carry her on.

896
00:51:23,585 --> 00:51:25,335
- It was Thunderbird.

897
00:51:27,383 --> 00:51:30,860
It musta come down from
the trees and attacked.

898
00:51:30,860 --> 00:51:34,414
We were so close to the
nest, it felt threatened.

899
00:51:34,414 --> 00:51:36,376
I shoulda thought of that.
I shoulda thought of it.

900
00:51:36,376 --> 00:51:37,302
- Why you fucker!

901
00:51:37,302 --> 00:51:38,558
- Horty, Horty, no.

902
00:51:38,558 --> 00:51:40,712
No no no, I got you, I got you.

903
00:51:40,712 --> 00:51:42,846
I got you, brother, it's all right.

904
00:51:42,846 --> 00:51:44,346
- Fuck, fuck fuck!

905
00:51:46,406 --> 00:51:48,239
The footage is ruined.

906
00:51:49,617 --> 00:51:50,617
- You bitch!

907
00:51:51,873 --> 00:51:54,174
You just watched this poor woman die,

908
00:51:54,174 --> 00:51:57,677
and all you can think
about is your footage?

909
00:51:57,677 --> 00:52:00,792
I'm not playing anymore! We're going home!

910
00:52:00,792 --> 00:52:02,552
- No, no no no, we can't.

911
00:52:02,552 --> 00:52:05,005
We gotta go on, I mean
for Reid if nothing else.

912
00:52:05,005 --> 00:52:06,922
- No, we're going back.

913
00:52:07,763 --> 00:52:10,022
- If you leave, you're in
violation of your contract.

914
00:52:10,022 --> 00:52:11,246
- That's right, that's right.

915
00:52:11,246 --> 00:52:13,660
And none of you is getting paid.

916
00:52:13,660 --> 00:52:15,688
- Fuck your money.

917
00:52:15,688 --> 00:52:17,559
I'm taking them back, and both of you

918
00:52:17,559 --> 00:52:18,915
will be brought up on charges.

919
00:52:18,915 --> 00:52:21,677
- No no, no no, that had
nothing to do with me.

920
00:52:21,677 --> 00:52:22,664
My hands are clean.

921
00:52:22,664 --> 00:52:25,419
I mean, Bigsby's the one
in charge of safety anyway,

922
00:52:25,419 --> 00:52:28,434
and it doesn't matter anyway,
because you all signed

923
00:52:28,434 --> 00:52:32,483
contracts that explicitly
stated about acts of God.

924
00:52:32,483 --> 00:52:34,865
I'm just pointing out
the legal facts here.

925
00:52:34,865 --> 00:52:37,448
- Legal facts? Are you serious?

926
00:52:38,920 --> 00:52:39,870
Do you even have permits?

927
00:52:39,870 --> 00:52:43,180
Lighting campfires near the trails.

928
00:52:43,180 --> 00:52:44,243
I'll wait for there to be criminal charges

929
00:52:44,243 --> 00:52:46,123
coming for both of you.

930
00:52:46,123 --> 00:52:47,491
- Everything we've done here has been

931
00:52:47,491 --> 00:52:49,270
done properly, understand?

932
00:52:49,270 --> 00:52:50,659
- Properly?

933
00:52:50,659 --> 00:52:51,950
Well, I bet none of this sort of thing

934
00:52:51,950 --> 00:52:53,784
ever happened on Monster Quest.

935
00:52:53,784 --> 00:52:55,773
- Monster Quest?

936
00:52:55,773 --> 00:52:58,290
They ain’t no damn Monster Quest.

937
00:52:58,290 --> 00:53:00,136
They ain’t shit.

938
00:53:00,136 --> 00:53:04,411
They're liars, and they're
cheats. That's what they are!

939
00:53:04,411 --> 00:53:06,951
He sells car insurance.

940
00:53:06,951 --> 00:53:10,221
And we do commercials for pastry shops.

941
00:53:10,221 --> 00:53:13,752
- What? I thought you were a professor.

942
00:53:13,752 --> 00:53:14,771
- No no no.

943
00:53:14,771 --> 00:53:17,526
You know, everybody, we
need to take a minute.

944
00:53:17,526 --> 00:53:20,376
- Lester, I always knew there
was something wrong with you.

945
00:53:20,376 --> 00:53:22,526
- [Lester] I'm a professional.
We're all professionals here.

946
00:53:22,526 --> 00:53:23,693
- Hey, Lester.

947
00:53:26,483 --> 00:53:28,566
Lester, you got my money?

948
00:53:34,568 --> 00:53:37,555
- Bigsby, we're all gonna be so rich

949
00:53:37,555 --> 00:53:39,555
once we find that Thunderbird.

950
00:53:39,555 --> 00:53:40,739
We're all gonna have bonuses.

951
00:53:40,739 --> 00:53:43,224
You're gonna be a billionaire.

952
00:53:43,224 --> 00:53:45,807
- Oh, Lester, you been exposed.

953
00:53:47,265 --> 00:53:50,046
And now I guess we can
all take our mask off,

954
00:53:50,046 --> 00:53:52,486
show who we really are.

955
00:53:52,486 --> 00:53:53,998
(gun firing)

956
00:53:53,998 --> 00:53:55,740
- Oh, James!

957
00:53:55,740 --> 00:53:57,416
James, oh my God.

958
00:53:57,416 --> 00:54:00,083
Aw, Jesus. Someone get his pack.

959
00:54:01,944 --> 00:54:05,581
Shit, that psycho ape took everything.

960
00:54:05,581 --> 00:54:06,414
Horty!

961
00:54:08,198 --> 00:54:09,365
Horty, please!

962
00:54:11,084 --> 00:54:13,198
- Man, leave me alone.

963
00:54:13,198 --> 00:54:15,132
- [Kyra] Horty, please help me.

964
00:54:15,132 --> 00:54:16,861
- Help you?

965
00:54:16,861 --> 00:54:18,219
Help you what?

966
00:54:18,219 --> 00:54:19,986
Help you watch him die?

967
00:54:19,986 --> 00:54:22,227
- [Kyra] He's not gonna die.

968
00:54:22,227 --> 00:54:24,227
- He's dead. He said so.

969
00:54:26,344 --> 00:54:28,312
- Okay, Horty.

970
00:54:28,312 --> 00:54:30,078
Horty, listen to me.

971
00:54:30,078 --> 00:54:35,078
Yes, you're gonna help me.
We're gonna carry him out.

972
00:54:35,265 --> 00:54:39,155
- We don't know where
we are. We got no food.

973
00:54:39,155 --> 00:54:40,155
We got shit.

974
00:54:42,067 --> 00:54:43,567
- He's not moving.

975
00:54:45,358 --> 00:54:47,888
- [Kyra] He's passed out.

976
00:54:47,888 --> 00:54:50,758
- Well maybe that's for the best.

977
00:54:50,758 --> 00:54:53,425
- How? How is that for the best?

978
00:54:55,127 --> 00:54:59,415
- Better to die in your sleep
than awake and in agony.

979
00:54:59,415 --> 00:55:02,131
- Well, what are we gonna do?

980
00:55:02,131 --> 00:55:05,560
- We're fucking stranded. What can we do?

981
00:55:05,560 --> 00:55:07,086
- God, I'm so sick of your whining.

982
00:55:07,086 --> 00:55:08,414
Quit being a bitch!

983
00:55:08,414 --> 00:55:11,608
- Oh, just shut the fuck up, please!

984
00:55:11,608 --> 00:55:12,894
- Shut him up!

985
00:55:12,894 --> 00:55:16,061
(soft dramatic music)

986
00:55:17,930 --> 00:55:19,763
- Horty, what's wrong?

987
00:55:23,089 --> 00:55:25,185
- I'm sick, man.

988
00:55:25,185 --> 00:55:27,194
- [Lester] What do you mean you're sick?

989
00:55:27,194 --> 00:55:31,873
- It hurts. Like, it hurts so
bad, I can't even walk, man.

990
00:55:31,873 --> 00:55:35,040
(soft dramatic music)

991
00:55:35,918 --> 00:55:38,031
- He's gonna bring that
bear back or worse.

992
00:55:38,031 --> 00:55:39,446
And then we'll all be dead.

993
00:55:39,446 --> 00:55:41,313
It'll be your fault, stupid!

994
00:55:41,313 --> 00:55:42,646
- That's enough!

995
00:55:44,593 --> 00:55:46,993
I think you need to take a walk.

996
00:55:46,993 --> 00:55:48,004
- You did not...

997
00:55:48,004 --> 00:55:50,294
- Take a fucking walk!

998
00:55:50,294 --> 00:55:52,877
(rain pelting)

999
00:55:54,241 --> 00:55:55,414
Do it.

1000
00:55:55,414 --> 00:55:58,581
(soft dramatic music)

1001
00:56:04,270 --> 00:56:06,770
I was never very good at much.

1002
00:56:07,956 --> 00:56:11,956
When I was little, everybody
just called me Les.

1003
00:56:13,678 --> 00:56:17,095
I found out one day, folks had a nickname

1004
00:56:18,215 --> 00:56:20,298
they used behind my back.

1005
00:56:21,438 --> 00:56:22,271
Less Than.

1006
00:56:25,054 --> 00:56:27,422
Because that's what I was.

1007
00:56:27,422 --> 00:56:28,255
Less than.

1008
00:56:31,241 --> 00:56:34,600
When I moved away to Tulla County,

1009
00:56:34,600 --> 00:56:36,767
I never went by Les again.

1010
00:56:37,758 --> 00:56:38,898
Always Lester.

1011
00:56:38,898 --> 00:56:41,481
(rain pelting)

1012
00:56:42,460 --> 00:56:45,377
Thought it would make a difference.

1013
00:56:46,530 --> 00:56:49,465
Like finding the Thunderbird.

1014
00:56:49,465 --> 00:56:52,178
I thought if I could just get
evidence for it, you know,

1015
00:56:52,178 --> 00:56:54,261
I'd finally be something.

1016
00:56:55,636 --> 00:56:58,219
Something more than what I was.

1017
00:57:00,215 --> 00:57:01,048
More.

1018
00:57:02,535 --> 00:57:03,368
Not less.

1019
00:57:03,368 --> 00:57:05,951
(rain pelting)

1020
00:57:07,281 --> 00:57:09,448
Guess no matter what I do,

1021
00:57:10,401 --> 00:57:12,484
I'm always gonna be Less.

1022
00:57:15,307 --> 00:57:19,390
- Hey, bud, I'm sorry
everything got stolen, man.

1023
00:57:20,844 --> 00:57:24,261
Guess you'll never get that footage, huh?

1024
00:57:29,093 --> 00:57:30,727
- Maybe we don't need it.

1025
00:57:30,727 --> 00:57:31,560
- Huh?

1026
00:57:35,851 --> 00:57:37,851
- We just need evidence.

1027
00:57:38,978 --> 00:57:41,495
It doesn't have to be the footage.

1028
00:57:41,495 --> 00:57:42,328
- What?

1029
00:57:43,345 --> 00:57:46,135
- Why didn't I think of this before?

1030
00:57:46,135 --> 00:57:48,602
- [Horty] Think of what?

1031
00:57:48,602 --> 00:57:51,102
- Eggs, we just need the eggs.

1032
00:57:53,889 --> 00:57:57,266
Fucking hell (chuckles).

1033
00:57:57,266 --> 00:58:00,849
(soft dramatic music)

1034
00:58:00,849 --> 00:58:03,432
(rain falling)

1035
00:58:12,478 --> 00:58:14,114
- Hey.

1036
00:58:14,114 --> 00:58:17,747
He's just suffering.
There's nothing we can do.

1037
00:58:17,747 --> 00:58:19,214
We gotta go.

1038
00:58:19,214 --> 00:58:21,032
- We can't, we can't leave him.

1039
00:58:21,032 --> 00:58:23,105
- Clarissa and Lester are already gone.

1040
00:58:23,105 --> 00:58:24,696
Bigsby, he's gonna come back.

1041
00:58:24,696 --> 00:58:27,123
We gotta go. We gotta go.

1042
00:58:27,123 --> 00:58:27,995
- No please.

1043
00:58:27,995 --> 00:58:28,828
- We gotta go.

1044
00:58:28,828 --> 00:58:29,863
- Sorry!

1045
00:58:29,863 --> 00:58:33,030
(soft dramatic music)

1046
00:58:52,643 --> 00:58:55,310
- Time to clean up another mess.

1047
00:58:58,435 --> 00:59:00,852
Everything is fucking ruined.

1048
00:59:03,043 --> 00:59:05,543
The show, my life, everything.

1049
00:59:06,691 --> 00:59:09,358
Goddam Horty, stupid bitch Kyra!

1050
00:59:11,214 --> 00:59:12,823
Oh!

1051
00:59:12,823 --> 00:59:15,990
(soft dramatic music)

1052
00:59:24,558 --> 00:59:26,975
(gun firing)

1053
00:59:29,610 --> 00:59:32,458
(laughing)

1054
00:59:32,458 --> 00:59:33,291
Woo, what?

1055
00:59:36,378 --> 00:59:39,128
(hard breathing)

1056
00:59:42,575 --> 00:59:46,025
- Please, Bigsby. Please, please, go away.

1057
00:59:46,025 --> 00:59:49,192
(soft dramatic music)

1058
00:59:50,503 --> 00:59:53,086
(rain falling)

1059
01:00:03,734 --> 01:00:06,901
(soft dramatic music)

1060
01:00:23,374 --> 01:00:25,679
(gun firing)

1061
01:00:25,679 --> 01:00:29,138
(soft dramatic music)

1062
01:00:29,138 --> 01:00:31,721
(rain falling)

1063
01:00:42,604 --> 01:00:45,771
(soft dramatic music)

1064
01:01:02,788 --> 01:01:03,621
- Shit.

1065
01:01:05,260 --> 01:01:06,193
Kyra.

1066
01:01:06,193 --> 01:01:09,360
(soft dramatic music)

1067
01:01:31,036 --> 01:01:32,286
Oh, shit, shit.

1068
01:01:34,562 --> 01:01:36,677
- What's wrong, Horty?

1069
01:01:36,677 --> 01:01:38,760
- Whoa, I won't say shit.

1070
01:01:40,343 --> 01:01:42,760
(struggling)

1071
01:01:43,628 --> 01:01:46,628
(Clarissa shouting)

1072
01:01:49,776 --> 01:01:52,162
- You fucking ruined everything.

1073
01:01:52,162 --> 01:01:54,495
(screaming)

1074
01:01:58,834 --> 01:02:01,917
You fucking ruined everything, Horty.

1075
01:02:03,703 --> 01:02:04,620
God dammit!

1076
01:02:07,106 --> 01:02:10,642
Squirm, squirm like a fucking worm.

1077
01:02:10,642 --> 01:02:13,392
(water bubbling)

1078
01:02:15,079 --> 01:02:18,246
(soft dramatic music)

1079
01:02:32,841 --> 01:02:35,481
(birds singing)

1080
01:02:35,481 --> 01:02:38,648
(soft dramatic music)

1081
01:02:40,020 --> 01:02:41,187
- Hey, Lester.

1082
01:02:42,345 --> 01:02:44,398
You can't run from me.

1083
01:02:44,398 --> 01:02:47,148
Come on, boy, take it like a man.

1084
01:02:48,020 --> 01:02:49,341
(gun firing)

1085
01:02:49,341 --> 01:02:52,258
(Lester screaming)

1086
01:02:54,526 --> 01:02:57,693
(soft dramatic music)

1087
01:03:13,411 --> 01:03:15,744
You can't hide from me, boy.

1088
01:03:17,816 --> 01:03:20,483
Come on now, take it like a man.

1089
01:03:22,760 --> 01:03:23,884
Face me.

1090
01:03:23,884 --> 01:03:27,051
(soft dramatic music)

1091
01:03:31,702 --> 01:03:33,445
(knee striking)

1092
01:03:33,445 --> 01:03:34,612
What the hell?

1093
01:03:35,770 --> 01:03:37,962
God bless it, Lester.

1094
01:03:37,962 --> 01:03:40,598
Now we're gonna have
to go the messy route.

1095
01:03:40,598 --> 01:03:43,515
(Lester screaming)

1096
01:03:46,268 --> 01:03:49,101
You know, Lester, you surprise me.

1097
01:03:50,689 --> 01:03:54,192
I didn't know you could be so much fun.

1098
01:03:54,192 --> 01:03:57,061
You know, most folks I bring out here,

1099
01:03:57,061 --> 01:03:59,287
pretty boring actually.

1100
01:03:59,287 --> 01:04:01,506
Don't have no adventure spirit.

1101
01:04:01,506 --> 01:04:02,923
They're wannabes.

1102
01:04:04,224 --> 01:04:08,394
Like that person y'all found
back there, in the woods.

1103
01:04:08,394 --> 01:04:09,847
They were plum simple.

1104
01:04:09,847 --> 01:04:12,961
They didn't even put up no kinda fight.

1105
01:04:12,961 --> 01:04:16,471
You know, I oughta bury
them a little deeper.

1106
01:04:16,471 --> 01:04:19,685
I guess those bears got to rooting around.

1107
01:04:19,685 --> 01:04:23,093
But you, Lester, you run. You fight.

1108
01:04:23,093 --> 01:04:25,510
You make this all worthwhile.

1109
01:04:26,759 --> 01:04:31,260
I think that makes us a lot
alike, you and I, Lester.

1110
01:04:31,260 --> 01:04:33,729
We lie, and we'll cheat our way

1111
01:04:33,729 --> 01:04:36,460
into getting that big payoff.

1112
01:04:36,460 --> 01:04:40,321
But you know what? I'm
gonna get my payoff.

1113
01:04:40,321 --> 01:04:42,654
All you're getting is offed.

1114
01:04:43,692 --> 01:04:46,379
Kinda ironic, don't you think?

1115
01:04:46,379 --> 01:04:47,740
Come out here looking for that big

1116
01:04:47,740 --> 01:04:49,657
beast monster of yours.

1117
01:04:50,721 --> 01:04:54,321
And found one, no dick,
just not what you thought.

1118
01:04:54,321 --> 01:04:55,154
- Oh!

1119
01:04:56,431 --> 01:04:57,264
- Oh.

1120
01:04:58,181 --> 01:04:59,598
You little bitch.

1121
01:05:03,899 --> 01:05:05,419
Are you kidding?

1122
01:05:05,419 --> 01:05:07,669
(coughing)

1123
01:05:09,189 --> 01:05:10,022
Wow.

1124
01:05:11,427 --> 01:05:13,510
Pretty tough little dude.

1125
01:05:14,469 --> 01:05:16,719
(gurgling)

1126
01:05:21,818 --> 01:05:24,068
(coughing)

1127
01:05:25,243 --> 01:05:26,076
Wow, wow.

1128
01:05:28,522 --> 01:05:30,689

1129
01:05:31,616 --> 01:05:35,525

1134
01:06:43,169 --> 01:06:46,336
(soft dramatic music)

1135
01:06:50,587 --> 01:06:52,230
- Oh, that bitch.

1136
01:06:52,230 --> 01:06:55,397
(soft dramatic music)

1137
01:07:02,011 --> 01:07:05,270

1138
01:07:05,270 --> 01:07:08,437
(soft dramatic music)

1139
01:07:18,192 --> 01:07:19,025
Kyra.

1140
01:07:20,405 --> 01:07:21,822
I was so worried.

1141
01:07:23,290 --> 01:07:24,373
Are you okay?

1142
01:07:25,908 --> 01:07:26,986
- No.

1143
01:07:26,986 --> 01:07:30,153
(soft dramatic music)

1144
01:07:32,392 --> 01:07:33,725
- Are you alone?

1145
01:07:36,462 --> 01:07:37,712
Where's Lester?

1146
01:07:38,794 --> 01:07:40,570
- Where's Horty?

1147
01:07:40,570 --> 01:07:41,820
- I don't know.

1148
01:07:43,999 --> 01:07:46,149
Here, give me your hand.

1149
01:07:46,149 --> 01:07:48,277
We should really get out of here.

1150
01:07:48,277 --> 01:07:50,085
- What's in your other hand?

1151
01:07:50,085 --> 01:07:52,585
Your other hand, what's in it?

1152
01:07:53,597 --> 01:07:55,232
- Kyra.

1153
01:07:55,232 --> 01:07:57,565
(screaming)

1154
01:07:58,794 --> 01:08:00,240
Ow.

1155
01:08:00,240 --> 01:08:01,209
No!

1156
01:08:01,209 --> 01:08:03,959
