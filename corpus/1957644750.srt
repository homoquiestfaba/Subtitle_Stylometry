1
00:01:02,796 --> 00:01:05,231
HE'S Q ( footsteps echoing )

2
00:01:22,248 --> 00:01:24,350
( thunder rumbling )

3
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,242
( truck horn blaring )

4
00:03:25,939 --> 00:03:28,675
LET'S REVIEW THE MOTION FOR THE INSANITY PLEA

5
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:38,751
ON THE BASIS OF THE PREVIOUS TESTIMONY.

6
00:03:38,751 --> 00:03:45,625
ON THE BASIS OF THE PREVIOUS TESTIMONY.

7
00:03:45,658 --> 00:03:49,662
Attorney: IT'S ALL IN THE FILE, YOUR HONOR.

8
00:03:49,696 --> 00:03:51,698
ACUTE PARANOIA, SCHIZOPHRENIA.

9
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:54,033
MY CLIENT DOESN'T EVEN REMEMBER

10
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:56,669
COMMITTING THE CRIME IN QUESTION.

11
00:03:56,703 --> 00:03:57,971
EVEN A POLYGRAPH PROVED THAT.

12
00:03:58,004 --> 00:04:01,374
- OBJECTION, YOUR HONOR. INADMISSIBLE. - SUSTAINED.

13
00:04:01,407 --> 00:04:03,610
WE ALL KNOW EVEN POLYGRAPHS LIE.

14
00:04:03,643 --> 00:04:05,979
THANKS FOR THAT PIECE OF INFORMATION. APPRECIATE IT.

15
00:04:06,012 --> 00:04:07,580
IN ANY STAGE, YOUR HONOR,

16
00:04:07,614 --> 00:04:09,549
I DON'T KNOW HOW RELEVANT

17
00:04:09,582 --> 00:04:13,419
MR. McNAMARA'S SO-CALLED ECHO PET SCAN ANALYSIS

18
00:04:13,453 --> 00:04:14,554
- IS GONNA BE. - I CAN MAKE IT VERY RELEVANT,

19
00:04:14,587 --> 00:04:17,657
IF COUNSEL WILL JUST GIVE ME AN OPPORTUNITY TO STEP UP.

20
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:20,560
- STEP UP. - THANK YOU.

21
00:04:25,765 --> 00:04:30,637
THE DEFENDANT DID, INDEED, MURDER STACY SMITH.

22
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:32,639
THE ONLY QUESTION IS,

23
00:04:32,672 --> 00:04:35,975
WAS HE INSANE AT THE TIME?

24
00:04:38,011 --> 00:04:40,813
I CALL DR. LAZARRE.

25
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:20,653
HELLO, DOCTOR. YOU KNOW THE PROCEDURE.

26
00:05:20,687 --> 00:05:22,955
YOU GOT FIVE MINUTES.

27
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:41,741
HELLO, JONAS.

28
00:05:41,774 --> 00:05:43,910
FINALLY GETTING TO SEE ME.

29
00:05:46,746 --> 00:05:49,916
THEY'RE SAYING IT'S HARDER FOR YOU SHRINKS TO GET INTO THIS PLACE

30
00:05:49,949 --> 00:05:53,019
THAN IT IS FOR US SICK FUCKS TO GET OUT.

31
00:05:53,052 --> 00:05:55,388
YET HERE YOU ARE.

32
00:05:57,056 --> 00:05:58,925
INTRIGUING, ISN'T IT?

33
00:05:58,958 --> 00:06:01,994
YOU WERE IN COURT.

34
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:05,798
YOU SAW THE EVIDENCE, YOU AND YOUR FANCY LAWYERS.

35
00:06:05,832 --> 00:06:07,633
BUT THAT WASN'T GOOD ENOUGH FOR YOU.

36
00:06:07,667 --> 00:06:10,002
HUH?

37
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:14,874
YOU STILL HAD TO COME HERE AND SQUEEZE IT OUT OF ME.

38
00:06:14,907 --> 00:06:17,877
DO YOU FEEL ANY REMORSE?

39
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:19,912
LET ME SEE. REMORSE.

40
00:06:19,946 --> 00:06:24,250
I'M SORRY I CUT POOR SARAH LETTINGS INTO SO MANY PIECES,

41
00:06:24,283 --> 00:06:26,719
BUT THE BITCH HAD IT COMING, I SWEAR.

42
00:06:28,087 --> 00:06:30,423
MAN, SHE HAD A BEAUTIFUL SCREAM.

43
00:06:31,858 --> 00:06:33,926
IT'S A SHAME.

44
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:37,029
YOU HAVE DOUBTS, DON'T YOU?

45
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:40,266
BIG FUCKING DOUBTS.

46
00:06:40,299 --> 00:06:42,835
BUT NOT ME. NOT WHERE I'M GOING.

47
00:06:42,869 --> 00:06:44,871
THERE WAS A SEAT WAITING FOR ME

48
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:49,142
DOWN IN HELL THE MINUTE I WAS BORN, DOC.

49
00:06:49,175 --> 00:06:51,944
ME, MY LIFE...

50
00:06:51,978 --> 00:06:55,581
WOMEN, DEATH.

51
00:06:57,016 --> 00:07:00,720
THIS PLACE, THESE CHAINS.

52
00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:03,923
ALL PREAMBLE. 35 YEARS OF PURGATORY

53
00:07:03,956 --> 00:07:05,525
JUST TO SEE HOW MANY POOR SOULS

54
00:07:05,558 --> 00:07:07,960
I CAN DRAG DOWN WITH ME.

55
00:07:07,994 --> 00:07:09,896
I'M GOING TO THE SHOW NOW,

56
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:12,965
AND YOU CAN'T TOUCH ME THERE.

57
00:07:14,167 --> 00:07:17,003
NOBODY CAN.

58
00:07:17,036 --> 00:07:18,838
BUT YOU.

59
00:07:18,871 --> 00:07:21,974
YOU'RE STUCK HERE WITH YOUR MISERABLE DOUBTS.

60
00:07:22,008 --> 00:07:24,811
( Jonas sighs )

61
00:07:24,844 --> 00:07:26,979
I KNOW WHY YOU CAME HERE.

62
00:07:27,013 --> 00:07:28,781
I KNOW WHY YOU CAME HERE.

63
00:07:28,815 --> 00:07:30,983
I CAN SEE RIGHT THROUGH YOU.

64
00:07:32,819 --> 00:07:37,123
SOMETHING... SOMETHING IS EATING YOU ALIVE.

65
00:07:37,156 --> 00:07:38,324
WHAT ARE YOU GETTING AT?

66
00:07:38,357 --> 00:07:40,726
YOU'RE NOT HERE TO SAVE ME.

67
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:43,029
YOU'RE HERE TO SAVE YOURSELF.

68
00:07:44,997 --> 00:07:47,633
YOU'RE HERE TO SAVE YOURSELF!

69
00:07:47,667 --> 00:07:49,936
YOU'RE HERE TO SAVE YOURSELF!

70
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:51,871
- PLEASE... - YOU'RE HERE TO SAVE YOURSELF!

71
00:07:51,904 --> 00:07:53,906
JUST GIVE ME ONE MORE MINUTE.

72
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:57,677
JONAS!

73
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:09,121
SHH!

74
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:11,757
I'M NOT GONNA HURT YOU.

75
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:13,826
I'M NOT GONNA HURT YOU.

76
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:18,097
IAN, LOOK INSIDE YOURSELF.

77
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:29,008
JUST LIKE OLD TIMES, EH, BUDDY? JUST LIKE OLD TIMES.

78
00:08:29,041 --> 00:08:32,745
THE AMERICAN JUSTICE SYSTEM! WHOO!

79
00:08:32,778 --> 00:08:35,748
KNOCK OFF ALL THE CRAZIES. LOCK 'EM UP.

80
00:08:35,781 --> 00:08:38,017
YOU SET ME UP.

81
00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:41,053
TURNSTILE TO NOWHERE SYSTEM.

82
00:08:41,087 --> 00:08:43,022
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

83
00:08:43,055 --> 00:08:44,957
NOTHIN'. YOU SUMMED IT UP PERFECTLY.

84
00:08:44,991 --> 00:08:47,393
YOU'VE BEEN KEEPING AN AWFUL LOT TO YOURSELF LATELY.

85
00:08:47,426 --> 00:08:49,061
YOU ALL RIGHT? YOU OKAY?

86
00:08:49,095 --> 00:08:51,097
- YEAH, I'M FINE. - YOU'RE FINE? YOU'RE SURE?

87
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:53,099
- I SAID I'M FINE. - ALL RIGHT, HE'S FINE.

88
00:08:53,132 --> 00:08:55,868
COUNSELOR, GENTLEMEN, WHAT'LL IT BE?

89
00:08:55,902 --> 00:08:57,570
MARTINI EXTRA DRY.

90
00:08:59,972 --> 00:09:02,742
YOU KNOW WHAT? WHY DON'T YOU MAKE THAT TWO?

91
00:09:02,775 --> 00:09:05,011
ONE FOR MY OLD PAL HERE. THE DOC, HUH?

92
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:07,179
WHAT DO YOU SAY? ONE FOR OLD TIME'S SAKE?

93
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:10,249
JUST COFFEE.

94
00:09:10,283 --> 00:09:12,218
STIRRED OR SHAKEN?

95
00:09:12,251 --> 00:09:14,387
( imitates James Bond ) SHAKEN, NOT STIRRED.

96
00:09:21,861 --> 00:09:23,896
I'M SORRY YOU LOST YOUR GRANT.

97
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:26,098
TERESA TOLD ME.

98
00:09:26,132 --> 00:09:28,634
I KNOW HOW MUCH THAT RESEARCH MEANT TO YOU.

99
00:09:28,668 --> 00:09:31,237
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?

100
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:33,906
SOMEBODY UP THERE ON THAT BOARD...

101
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:36,075
- MARTY. - DOESN'T LIKE ME.

102
00:09:36,108 --> 00:09:37,710
COUNSELOR, YOUR DRINK.

103
00:09:37,743 --> 00:09:39,045
I'D LIKE TO CHANGE MY ORDER.

104
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:40,379
SCOTCH, DOUBLE.

105
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:42,882
I WANNA MAKE A TOAST

106
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:44,784
TO ALL THE THINGS THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN.

107
00:09:45,851 --> 00:09:47,320
COME ON, JOE.

108
00:09:47,353 --> 00:09:50,089
- FOR OLD TIME'S SAKE. - WHY DON'T WE DO THIS TOMORROW?

109
00:09:50,122 --> 00:09:52,391
I GOTTA GET BACK TO THE OFFICE.

110
00:10:06,472 --> 00:10:09,241
YOU ALWAYS GOT WHAT YOU WANTED,

111
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:12,778
ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO WOMEN.

112
00:10:12,812 --> 00:10:14,213
DON'T START WITH THAT, IAN.

113
00:10:14,246 --> 00:10:16,015
DON'T YOU START WITH THAT.

114
00:10:16,048 --> 00:10:17,817
DON'T START WITH THAT.

115
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:20,119
YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT. DON'T START, DON'T START.

116
00:10:20,152 --> 00:10:22,922
DON'T START ANYTHING AGAIN.

117
00:10:22,955 --> 00:10:25,725
- DON'T START... - I'M YOUR FRIEND.

118
00:10:25,758 --> 00:10:27,860
- I WANNA HELP YOU. - I DON'T WANT ANY HELP.

119
00:10:27,893 --> 00:10:30,096
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.

120
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:31,697
I DON'T WANT ANY FUCKIN' HELP.

121
00:10:31,731 --> 00:10:33,132
WHAT DO YOU WANT? WHAT, WHAT?

122
00:10:33,165 --> 00:10:34,900
TELL ME WHAT YOU WANT.

123
00:10:34,934 --> 00:10:36,802
I WANT TO BELIEVE IN SOMETHING.

124
00:10:36,836 --> 00:10:39,071
IAN, WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

125
00:10:39,105 --> 00:10:41,173
I GOTTA GO.

126
00:10:44,043 --> 00:10:46,345
I KNOW WHERE YOU'RE GOIN'.

127
00:10:46,379 --> 00:10:48,381
I'M NOT GOIN' THERE.

128
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:59,191
Woman: I DON'T KNOW. MAYBE IT'S JUST ME.

129
00:10:59,225 --> 00:11:03,295
MAYBE SOME PEOPLE ARE JUST BORN BROKEN.

130
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:06,332
BUT I'M NOT CRAZY, AND I DIDN'T TRY TO KILL MYSELF

131
00:11:06,365 --> 00:11:08,834
TO GET ATTENTION OR TO MAKE A POINT.

132
00:11:08,868 --> 00:11:11,737
I JUST WANTED TO FEEL BETTER.

133
00:11:11,771 --> 00:11:14,840
I'M SICK OF EVERYBODY TELLING ME TO JUST GET OUT OF BED

134
00:11:14,874 --> 00:11:18,110
AND DO SOMETHING FOR MYSELF.

135
00:11:18,144 --> 00:11:20,046
IT'S LIKE, ALL OF A SUDDEN,

136
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:23,315
I'M JUST GONNA BE HAPPY. MY TROUBLES WILL JUST GO AWAY.

137
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:28,287
HOW CAN THEY SAY THAT WHEN THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT IT FEELS LIKE?

138
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:31,791
COULD YOU TELL ME WHAT THE PAIN IS,

139
00:11:31,824 --> 00:11:33,225
OR WHERE IT COMES FROM?

140
00:11:33,259 --> 00:11:35,461
I DON'T KNOW WHERE IT COMES FROM.

141
00:11:35,494 --> 00:11:38,230
IT'S NOT LIKE IT'S PHYSICAL PAIN.

142
00:11:38,264 --> 00:11:42,535
I DON'T FEEL LIKE SOMEONE'S STEPPING ON MY FOOT ALL THE TIME.

143
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:47,039
IT'S THE KIND OF PAIN YOU FEEL LIKE,

144
00:11:47,073 --> 00:11:51,510
WHEN YOU'RE A KID, AND YOU'RE SCARED OF THE DARK,

145
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:54,046
AND YOUR MOM MAKES YOU SLEEP WITH THE LIGHTS OFF

146
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:57,083
SO YOU'LL GET OVER IT.

147
00:11:57,116 --> 00:11:59,218
SO YOU LIE AWAKE IN THE DARK,

148
00:11:59,251 --> 00:12:01,120
JUST TERRIFIED OF THINGS YOU CAN'T SEE,

149
00:12:01,153 --> 00:12:04,023
BUT TOO SCARED OF YOUR PARENTS

150
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:07,026
TO JUST TURN THE LIGHTS ON.

151
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:09,328
SO YOU STAY AWAKE THE WHOLE NIGHT,

152
00:12:09,361 --> 00:12:12,298
WAITING FOR THE SUN TO COME UP,

153
00:12:12,331 --> 00:12:15,434
HOPING YOUR MOM'S GONNA COME IN AND CHECK ON YOU.

154
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:20,573
IT'S HARD FOR ME TO EXPLAIN IT.

155
00:12:20,606 --> 00:12:24,276
IT'S LIKE... IT'S LIKE THE SUN NEVER CAME UP,

156
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:27,012
AND NOBODY EVER CAME BACK FOR ME.

157
00:12:27,046 --> 00:12:30,316
SO I'M JUST STUCK WHERE I AM.

158
00:12:30,349 --> 00:12:33,586
IS IT SO UNREASONABLE TO THINK THAT, AT SOME POINT,

159
00:12:33,619 --> 00:12:36,288
SOMEBODY WOULD GET SO TIRED OF BEING THAT WAY

160
00:12:36,322 --> 00:12:40,459
THAT THEY WOULD JUST WANNA END IT?

161
00:12:40,493 --> 00:12:43,596
I SAW A MOVIE ONCE WHERE A PERSON SAID,

162
00:12:43,629 --> 00:12:46,932
"YOU CAN'T CHANGE A BAD HAND OF CARDS.

163
00:12:46,966 --> 00:12:49,168
SOMETIMES, YOU JUST HAVE TO FOLD."

164
00:12:57,676 --> 00:13:00,479
HEY, HEY, HEY. COME ON, COME ON, CUT THAT OUT.

165
00:13:00,513 --> 00:13:02,414
YOU GUYS CAN FAWN ALL OVER EACH OTHER LATER.

166
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:05,184
THIS GUY MICHELSON, HE'S GOT SO MUCH MONEY.

167
00:13:05,217 --> 00:13:07,520
YOU GUYS, COME ON, IT'S GETTING LATE.

168
00:13:07,553 --> 00:13:10,189
NO! NO, NO, NO, NO. YOU CAN'T GO. YOU JUST GOT HERE.

169
00:13:10,222 --> 00:13:14,126
ALL RIGHT, IT'S OKAY. YOU STAY. I UNDERSTAND.

170
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:17,229
BUT I'M TIRED, SO I'M GOING HOME, OKAY?

171
00:13:18,964 --> 00:13:20,900
THANK YOU.

172
00:13:20,933 --> 00:13:23,135
SEE YOU LATER.

173
00:13:25,004 --> 00:13:27,173
ARE YOU SURE YOU'RE OKAY TO DRIVE?

174
00:13:27,206 --> 00:13:28,674
( all laughing )

175
00:13:28,707 --> 00:13:31,076
YEAH, I'M FINE, I'M FINE.

176
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:34,013
I'M A BIG GIRL. SEE YA LATER.

177
00:13:34,046 --> 00:13:35,981
- BYE, JOE. - BYE, WENDY.

178
00:13:41,353 --> 00:13:47,059
I'M SORRY. JUST EXCUSE ME FOR ONE SECOND, OKAY?

179
00:14:27,032 --> 00:14:29,101
STARTING KINDA EARLY, AREN'T YOU, DOC?

180
00:14:32,004 --> 00:14:34,373
WENDY!!

181
00:14:59,431 --> 00:15:03,335
HELENE... CANCEL ALL...

182
00:15:03,369 --> 00:15:06,405
APPOINTMENTS FOR THIS AFTERNOON.

183
00:15:06,438 --> 00:15:09,675
YOU DON'T HAVE ANY APPOINTMENTS THIS AFTERNOON, DOCTOR.

184
00:15:25,024 --> 00:15:27,359
( phone ringing )

185
00:15:27,393 --> 00:15:29,662
TERESA LAZARRE'S OFFICE. THIS IS ANNA SPEAKING.

186
00:15:29,695 --> 00:15:32,464
YES, HELLO. MAY I SPEAK WITH MY WIFE, PLEASE?

187
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:37,469
TERESA, IT'S IAN.

188
00:15:43,642 --> 00:15:45,511
YOU KNOW WHAT? TELL HIM I'M NOT HERE.

189
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:51,350
IAN, SHE DOESN'T WANNA TALK TO YOU, OKAY?

190
00:15:51,383 --> 00:15:53,452
- JUST ASK HER TO COME TO THE PHONE. - NO, IAN.

191
00:15:53,485 --> 00:15:56,522
I DON'T WANNA TALK TO YOU. I WANNA TALK TO MY WIFE.

192
00:15:56,555 --> 00:15:58,223
DON'T YELL, IAN.

193
00:15:58,257 --> 00:16:00,726
- DON'T FUCKING HANG UP ON ME! - ( glass shatters )

194
00:16:00,759 --> 00:16:04,630
PUT MY GODDAMN WIFE ON THE PHONE, GODDAMN YOU!

195
00:16:04,663 --> 00:16:06,398
DOCTOR?

196
00:16:17,676 --> 00:16:20,045
JOE, THESE ARE READY FOR YOUR SIGNATURE.

197
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:22,314
AND DR. IAN LAZARRE'S OFFICE IS ON LINE TWO.

198
00:16:22,348 --> 00:16:24,483
SOUNDS IMPORTANT.

199
00:16:27,252 --> 00:16:29,488
YEAH, HELENE, HI. IT'S JOE.

200
00:16:33,559 --> 00:16:35,427
ALL RIGHT, CALL HIS EX-WIFE.

201
00:16:36,729 --> 00:16:38,864
JOE, YOU HAVE A MEETING WITH KRAVITZ IN TEN MINUTES.

202
00:16:38,897 --> 00:16:41,033
STALL HIM, ROSIE.

203
00:16:52,444 --> 00:16:54,880
I DIDN'T KNOW WHO ELSE TO CALL. THERE WAS THIS BIG CRASH.

204
00:16:54,913 --> 00:16:57,249
DOES HE HAVE ANY EXTRA KEYS?

205
00:16:57,282 --> 00:16:59,184
- WHAT? - KEYS, GODDAMN IT. KEYS!

206
00:16:59,218 --> 00:17:01,220
I DON'T KNOW. HE NEVER GAVE ME ANY.

207
00:17:01,253 --> 00:17:03,188
GET OUT OF THE WAY.

208
00:17:08,594 --> 00:17:09,528
JESUS CHRIST.

209
00:17:09,561 --> 00:17:11,797
HE'S IN MY HEAD.

210
00:17:11,830 --> 00:17:14,600
HE'S IN MY HEAD!

211
00:17:14,633 --> 00:17:16,435
GET AN AMBULANCE.

212
00:17:16,468 --> 00:17:18,537
JONAS IS IN MY HEAD AGAIN.

213
00:17:18,570 --> 00:17:21,273
- OH, JONAS... - WHAT ARE YOU TALKIN' ABOUT?

214
00:17:21,306 --> 00:17:23,642
HE'S IN MY HEAD AGAIN, JOE.

215
00:17:23,675 --> 00:17:26,311
JESUS CHRIST.

216
00:17:26,345 --> 00:17:29,214
JONAS IS IN MY HEAD AGAIN.

217
00:17:29,248 --> 00:17:31,583
JONAS KELLAR IS DEAD. HE'S DEAD AND BURIED.

218
00:17:31,617 --> 00:17:34,787
HE TOLD ME. HE SAID IF I CLOSED MY EYES...

219
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:37,389
YOU GOTTA LEAVE IT ALONE.

220
00:17:37,423 --> 00:17:39,558
I'M ALL ALONE.

221
00:17:39,591 --> 00:17:41,493
HELENE, GET IN HERE.

222
00:17:42,661 --> 00:17:45,464
HELENE, YOU CAN TAKE THE DAY OFF.

223
00:17:45,497 --> 00:17:47,666
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

224
00:18:17,796 --> 00:18:19,531
I'M DR. TOBIAS.

225
00:18:19,565 --> 00:18:21,366
I ASSUME YOU'RE WITH MR. LAZARRE.

226
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,768
YEAH. HE OKAY?

227
00:18:22,801 --> 00:18:26,472
HE HAS A DEEP LACERATION ON HIS LEFT FOREARM,

228
00:18:26,505 --> 00:18:28,974
SOME SELF-INFLICTED CUTS, AND HE'S LOST A LOT OF BLOOD.

229
00:18:29,007 --> 00:18:31,210
HE'S STABILIZED NOW, THOUGH.

230
00:18:31,243 --> 00:18:33,679
Woman on P.A.: DR. TOBIAS, YOU'RE WANTED IN I.C.U.

231
00:18:33,712 --> 00:18:35,514
HE WRITES HIS OWN PRESCRIPTIONS, DOESN'T HE?

232
00:18:35,547 --> 00:18:38,484
- YEAH. - IT'S NOT GOOD.

233
00:18:38,517 --> 00:18:40,719
YOUR FRIEND NEEDS HELP.

234
00:18:56,235 --> 00:18:57,870
WHAT HAPPENED?

235
00:18:57,903 --> 00:18:59,638
WELL, HE'S OKAY.

236
00:18:59,671 --> 00:19:02,207
HE GOT A LITTLE TOO DRUNK, CUT HIMSELF.

237
00:19:02,241 --> 00:19:03,642
THAT'S ALL THEY TOLD ME.

238
00:19:03,675 --> 00:19:06,478
YOU KNOW WHAT HE'S GOING TO SAY, DON'T YOU?

239
00:19:06,512 --> 00:19:07,546
HE'S GONNA SAY IT'S MY FAULT

240
00:19:07,579 --> 00:19:09,314
BECAUSE I WOULDN'T GO BACK TO HIM.

241
00:19:09,348 --> 00:19:11,650
IT'S EXACTLY WHAT HE'S GONNA SAY.

242
00:19:11,683 --> 00:19:13,952
I CAN'T TAKE ANY MORE OF THIS, JOE.

243
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:16,989
HE EXPECTS ME TO ALWAYS BE THERE FOR HIM WHEN HE HITS THE BOTTOM,

244
00:19:17,022 --> 00:19:18,891
AND I JUST CAN'T DO IT ANYMORE.

245
00:19:32,771 --> 00:19:34,940
LOOK, TERESA, MAYBE IT'S BEST THIS HAPPENED.

246
00:19:34,973 --> 00:19:36,608
HE'LL LISTEN TO YOU THIS TIME.

247
00:19:36,642 --> 00:19:38,243
MAYBE I DON'T WANT HIM TO LISTEN.

248
00:19:38,277 --> 00:19:40,579
MAYBE I JUST WANT HIM OUT OF MY LIFE.

249
00:19:40,612 --> 00:19:42,447
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO FIND HIM SOME HELP.

250
00:19:42,481 --> 00:19:46,018
MAYBE PUT HIM SOMEPLACE WHERE HE CAN GET BETTER.

251
00:19:46,051 --> 00:19:48,253
IF IT'S EASIER ON YOU, I'LL DRAW UP

252
00:19:48,287 --> 00:19:49,655
POWER OF ATTORNEY DOCUMENTS.

253
00:19:49,688 --> 00:19:53,425
HE'LL JUST RUN CIRCLES AROUND REHAB. WE BOTH KNOW THAT.

254
00:19:53,458 --> 00:19:55,294
THERE'S A PLACE.

255
00:19:55,327 --> 00:19:57,362
I KNOW THIS PLACE, IT'S VERY SPECIAL.

256
00:20:00,732 --> 00:20:03,268
WE'VE GOTTA HELP HIM.

257
00:20:04,603 --> 00:20:07,773
ALL RIGHT. WHATEVER YOU THINK'S BEST.

258
00:20:12,678 --> 00:20:15,447
( monitor beeping steadily )

259
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:30,829
OH, IAN. WHAT HAVE YOU DONE NOW?

260
00:20:37,402 --> 00:20:39,638
IT CAN'T GO ON LIKE THIS.

261
00:20:39,671 --> 00:20:42,541
I CAN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE.

262
00:20:42,574 --> 00:20:44,643
I'M SORRY, HONEY.

263
00:20:44,676 --> 00:20:46,511
( inhales sharply )

264
00:20:46,545 --> 00:20:49,982
YOU HAVE TO JUST GO AND BE THE LIFE OF THE PARTY.

265
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:55,354
LISTEN, HONEY, JOE AND I WERE TALKING,

266
00:20:55,387 --> 00:20:57,089
AND WE FOUND A PLACE FOR YOU TO GO.

267
00:20:57,122 --> 00:21:00,058
YOU KNOW, TO GET BETTER.

268
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:03,295
AND ONCE YOU'RE BETTER, THEN...

269
00:21:08,767 --> 00:21:11,737
LISTEN, I KNOW THAT YOU'RE TIRED, SO I'M GONNA GO.

270
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:15,574
TRY TO GET SOME REST, OKAY?

271
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:19,611
TRY NOT TO THINK SO MUCH.

272
00:21:19,645 --> 00:21:21,813
YOU ALWAYS THINK SO MUCH.

273
00:21:31,056 --> 00:21:32,824
TERESA.

274
00:22:20,038 --> 00:22:22,808
IS THAT MR. LAZARRE? - YES. I'M JOE McNAMARA.

275
00:22:22,841 --> 00:22:24,743
I'M RACQUEL CHAMBERS, AND THIS IS JAMES.

276
00:22:24,776 --> 00:22:26,111
- JAMES. - JOE.

277
00:22:26,144 --> 00:22:27,412
THIS IS MRS. LAZARRE.

278
00:22:29,815 --> 00:22:31,717
IT LOOKS LIKE MR. LAZARRE IS A VERY LUCKY MAN

279
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:33,919
TO HAVE A WIFE WHO CARES SO MUCH.

280
00:22:33,952 --> 00:22:35,587
- SHALL WE? - OH, LET ME.

281
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:36,855
IT'S OKAY. I GOT IT NOW.

282
00:22:38,757 --> 00:22:41,159
WE'RE GONNA CALL YOU IN A COUPLE OF DAYS,

283
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:42,561
AND TELL YOU HOW HE'S DOING.

284
00:22:42,594 --> 00:22:43,795
HE'S GOING TO NEED SOME TIME ALONE.

285
00:22:43,829 --> 00:22:47,532
MR. LAZARRE. I'M JAMES.

286
00:22:47,566 --> 00:22:49,434
WELCOME TO BLACKHURST.

287
00:22:49,468 --> 00:22:51,570
WE'RE GONNA GO INSIDE NOW.

288
00:22:51,603 --> 00:22:53,739
THERE'S NO VISITING FOR THE FIRST WEEK,

289
00:22:53,772 --> 00:22:55,841
THEN ONCE A WEEK FOR AN HOUR AFTER THAT.

290
00:22:55,874 --> 00:22:57,809
AND THERE WILL BE NO PHONE CALLS FOR THE FIRST THREE WEEKS.

291
00:22:57,843 --> 00:22:59,177
BYE NOW.

292
00:23:01,213 --> 00:23:02,848
THAT'S IT.

293
00:23:05,717 --> 00:23:06,885
Racquel: HELLO, MR. LAZARRE.

294
00:23:08,787 --> 00:23:11,790
DID YOU HAVE A NICE TRIP?

295
00:23:11,823 --> 00:23:14,659
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A WONDERFUL TIME HERE AT BLACKHURST.

296
00:23:14,693 --> 00:23:16,094
JUST RELAX.

297
00:23:16,128 --> 00:23:18,130
I FEEL LIKE WE JUST COMMITTED HIM.

298
00:23:36,915 --> 00:23:41,052
IAN, I'M GOING TO GO AND GET YOUR CHART AND THE KEY.

299
00:23:41,086 --> 00:23:42,888
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

300
00:23:44,156 --> 00:23:47,726
- YOU WON'T NEED THESE. - TAKE IT EASY.

301
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:49,694
THIS.

302
00:23:49,728 --> 00:23:51,196
MY WATCH?

303
00:23:51,229 --> 00:23:53,465
YES, THAT GOES. AND THIS.

304
00:23:54,833 --> 00:23:56,968
AND THIS.

305
00:24:04,342 --> 00:24:05,944
JAMES.

306
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,948
MY WATCH?

307
00:24:09,981 --> 00:24:13,518
WELL, IAN, SOME PATIENTS, THEY USE THE SHARP EDGES

308
00:24:13,552 --> 00:24:14,920
TO SLASH THEIR WRISTS.

309
00:24:14,953 --> 00:24:17,689
TIME'S A KILLER.

310
00:24:17,722 --> 00:24:20,959
SWISS WATCHES SEEM TO WORK THE BEST.

311
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:23,662
- JAMES? - YES.

312
00:24:23,695 --> 00:24:26,865
HERE WE GO, IAN. YOUR NEW HOME.

313
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:42,047
WELL, NICE AND CLEAN. NO SHARP EDGES.

314
00:24:47,586 --> 00:24:49,087
THIS ROOM NEEDS CURTAINS.

315
00:25:01,066 --> 00:25:02,167
YOUR SHOES.

316
00:25:06,071 --> 00:25:07,739
LOG HIM IN.

317
00:25:10,408 --> 00:25:12,143
HERE WE GO, IAN.

318
00:25:18,049 --> 00:25:21,186
IAN, WILL YOU GIVE ME YOUR HAND?

319
00:25:23,154 --> 00:25:25,090
THANK YOU.

320
00:25:46,745 --> 00:25:50,015
IAN, CAN YOU MAKE A FIST FOR ME?

321
00:25:51,082 --> 00:25:53,251
THANK YOU, JAMES.

322
00:26:04,162 --> 00:26:05,997
WHAT IS IT?

323
00:26:06,031 --> 00:26:07,999
YOU CAN TELL ME. I'M A DOCTOR.

324
00:26:08,033 --> 00:26:10,769
I LIKE DOCTORS.

325
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:17,676
HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN A NURSE?

326
00:26:17,709 --> 00:26:20,345
OH, I'M NOT A NURSE.

327
00:26:20,378 --> 00:26:23,014
I JUST LIKE WEARING THE UNIFORM.

328
00:26:24,816 --> 00:26:26,051
ALL RIGHT.

329
00:26:31,056 --> 00:26:32,123
THERE.

330
00:26:32,157 --> 00:26:34,726
NOW YOU JUST RELAX.

331
00:26:34,759 --> 00:26:37,329
IT'S ONLY A SEDATIVE.

332
00:26:39,064 --> 00:26:41,333
DIAZEPAM?

333
00:26:41,366 --> 00:26:43,335
PROMAZINE?

334
00:26:43,368 --> 00:26:45,170
MORPHINE?

335
00:26:45,203 --> 00:26:48,173
- SHH. - I'D LIKE SOME MORPHINE.

336
00:26:51,142 --> 00:26:52,711
SH.

337
00:26:54,012 --> 00:26:56,181
I'M SCARED.

338
00:28:17,162 --> 00:28:20,265
LET ME OUTTA HERE!

339
00:28:21,399 --> 00:28:24,836
LET ME OUT OF HERE!!

340
00:28:26,538 --> 00:28:30,141
OH, LET ME OUT OF HERE!

341
00:28:31,276 --> 00:28:34,312
PLEASE LET ME OUT OF HERE!

342
00:28:37,348 --> 00:28:40,251
LET ME OUT OF HERE!

343
00:28:48,893 --> 00:28:50,462
TAKE THESE OFF.

344
00:28:50,495 --> 00:28:53,098
NOW JUST TAKE IT EASY, SWEETIE.

345
00:28:53,131 --> 00:28:56,000
YOU'RE OVER THE WORST OF IT. YOU GAVE US A SCARE, THOUGH.

346
00:28:56,034 --> 00:28:58,236
WE DIDN'T THINK YOU WERE GOING TO MAKE IT.

347
00:28:58,269 --> 00:29:00,572
WHO AUTHORIZED RESTRAINING?

348
00:29:00,605 --> 00:29:04,242
YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO RESTRAIN PATIENTS IN DETOX.

349
00:29:04,275 --> 00:29:06,244
I COULD'VE BEEN ASPHYXIATED.

350
00:29:06,277 --> 00:29:08,213
LISTEN TO ME. IT TOOK SIX MEN

351
00:29:08,246 --> 00:29:11,116
JUST TO KEEP YOU FROM TEARING OUT YOUR OWN STITCHES.

352
00:29:11,149 --> 00:29:13,051
ARE YOU READY TO GET UP?

353
00:29:13,084 --> 00:29:15,487
DOCTOR WANTS TO SEE YOU SOON.

354
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:17,889
COME ON, IAN, LET'S GO.

355
00:29:17,922 --> 00:29:19,924
- HOW LONG HAVE I BEEN ASLEEP? - THREE DAYS. COME ON.

356
00:29:19,958 --> 00:29:22,127
- UP WE GO. - THREE DAYS?

357
00:29:24,162 --> 00:29:26,197
WHAT IS IT?

358
00:29:37,609 --> 00:29:39,844
THOSE ARE NASTY.

359
00:29:46,951 --> 00:29:49,020
IAN, YOU WERE CONVULSING,

360
00:29:49,053 --> 00:29:51,623
AND THE DOCTOR TOLD US TO TIE YOU DOWN.

361
00:29:51,656 --> 00:29:53,491
WHO'S IN CHARGE HERE?

362
00:29:53,525 --> 00:29:57,028
- IAN, JUST CALM DOWN. - WHO'S THE DOCTOR?

363
00:29:57,061 --> 00:29:59,197
DR. RENQUIST IS YOUR DOCTOR,

364
00:29:59,230 --> 00:30:01,299
AND YOU'RE GOING TO SEE HIM SOON. THEY ALL DO EVENTUALLY.

365
00:30:01,332 --> 00:30:03,501
THE VERNON RENQUIST?

366
00:30:05,403 --> 00:30:08,006
THERE. ALL BETTER.

367
00:30:09,374 --> 00:30:13,545
IAN, YOUR WIFE, SHE'S VERY PRETTY.

368
00:30:15,547 --> 00:30:18,082
MY WIFE'S DEAD.

369
00:30:18,116 --> 00:30:20,385
THERE. THAT'S BETTER, ISN'T IT?

370
00:30:20,418 --> 00:30:23,254
JAMES IS GONNA TAKE YOU TO THE CAFETERIA,

371
00:30:23,288 --> 00:30:24,622
AND YOU'RE GOING TO EAT SOMETHING.

372
00:30:24,656 --> 00:30:26,558
I WILL SEE YOU LATER.

373
00:31:01,059 --> 00:31:02,694
WHAT ARE YOU IN FOR?

374
00:31:05,263 --> 00:31:08,633
SORRY. BAD JOKE. WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

375
00:31:14,973 --> 00:31:18,176
IT'S A VERY NICE DAY, ISN'T IT?

376
00:31:23,047 --> 00:31:24,949
HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN HERE?

377
00:31:26,251 --> 00:31:27,752
TWENTY WEEKS.

378
00:31:27,785 --> 00:31:31,222
TWENTY WEEKS. THAT'S A LONG TIME FOR DETOX.

379
00:31:31,256 --> 00:31:33,491
WHAT KIND OF THERAPY...

380
00:31:33,524 --> 00:31:37,629
ARE YOU DOING? INDIVIDUAL OR GROUP?

381
00:31:40,331 --> 00:31:41,666
WHAT HAVE THEY GOT YOU ON?

382
00:31:41,699 --> 00:31:43,735
PROZAC OR RITALIN?

383
00:32:01,452 --> 00:32:06,057
DOC, THE RULES ARE, YOU GOTTA EAT.

384
00:32:12,597 --> 00:32:14,365
YOU SAYIN' YOU'RE NOT GONNA EAT?

385
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:16,134
OW. THAT HURTS.

386
00:32:18,369 --> 00:32:21,105
- WHAT ARE YOU DOIN'? - COME ON WITH ME.

387
00:32:21,139 --> 00:32:22,440
WHO'S YOUR SUPERVISOR?

388
00:33:20,264 --> 00:33:22,300
( keys jingling )

389
00:33:27,438 --> 00:33:30,041
ARE YA HUNGRY?

390
00:33:35,646 --> 00:33:37,482
YEAH.

391
00:33:41,886 --> 00:33:43,821
STAY RIGHT THERE.

392
00:33:46,591 --> 00:33:49,127
( thunder rumbling )

393
00:33:55,933 --> 00:33:58,603
WENDY, WENDY.

394
00:34:05,209 --> 00:34:08,379
I THOUGHT YOU WOULD BE NEEDING THIS ABOUT NOW.

395
00:34:08,413 --> 00:34:10,181
THANK YOU.

396
00:34:11,883 --> 00:34:14,318
HE'S VERY STRONG.

397
00:34:17,355 --> 00:34:19,624
HOW MUCH SEDATIVE DID HE SEE YOU ADMINISTER?

398
00:34:19,657 --> 00:34:22,560
IT WAS 25 MILLIGRAMS OR SO.

399
00:34:22,593 --> 00:34:27,098
HE THOUGHT IT WAS CHLORPROMAZINE OR SOMETHING.

400
00:34:28,666 --> 00:34:31,469
DID YOU TELL HIM WHAT IT REALLY WAS?

401
00:34:31,502 --> 00:34:32,737
NO.

402
00:34:37,375 --> 00:34:38,676
WENDY.

403
00:34:38,709 --> 00:34:40,945
HE KEEPS CALLING FOR WENDY.

404
00:34:40,978 --> 00:34:43,948
- WHO IS SHE? - HIS FIRST WIFE.

405
00:34:43,981 --> 00:34:47,485
TRAGICALLY KILLED IN A D.U.I. ACCIDENT.

406
00:34:47,518 --> 00:34:50,688
HE MUST HAVE LOVED HER VERY MUCH.

407
00:34:50,721 --> 00:34:53,291
APPARENTLY SO.

408
00:35:01,332 --> 00:35:04,168
YOU KNOW, I THINK HE'S BEGINNING TO LIKE YOU.

409
00:35:04,202 --> 00:35:07,572
WON'T BE LONG NOW BEFORE YOU'RE PART OF HIS DREAMS.

410
00:35:11,876 --> 00:35:14,412
ISN'T IT TIME THAT YOU TOLD HIM?

411
00:35:14,445 --> 00:35:18,382
TOLD HIM WHAT? THAT HIS DREAMS AREN'T REAL?

412
00:35:18,416 --> 00:35:20,251
THAT'S HIS ONLY LINK TO SANITY.

413
00:35:20,284 --> 00:35:22,386
IF HE KNEW WHAT WAS IN THAT SYRINGE,

414
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:24,655
HIS WHOLE WORLD WOULD COLLAPSE.

415
00:35:24,689 --> 00:35:26,591
HE'D REMEMBER TO LIE.

416
00:35:26,624 --> 00:35:29,327
WE'D LOSE HIM, HE'D BE GONE.

417
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:31,529
NO.

418
00:35:31,562 --> 00:35:35,500
LET HIM KNOW THAT YOU'RE UPPING THE DOSAGE.

419
00:35:35,533 --> 00:35:37,568
ALL RIGHT.

420
00:35:40,571 --> 00:35:42,640
WHAT DO YOU THINK WILL BECOME OF HIM?

421
00:35:42,673 --> 00:35:45,009
I DON'T KNOW.

422
00:35:45,042 --> 00:35:47,612
HE SEEMS TO BE SEEKING SOME KIND OF TRUTH

423
00:35:47,645 --> 00:35:49,614
IN HIS HEAD.

424
00:35:49,647 --> 00:35:52,950
HE MAY BE CLOSE TO AN ANSWER.

425
00:35:52,984 --> 00:35:55,586
I JUST DON'T KNOW WHAT KIND OF PEACE HE'S GONNA FIND

426
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:58,556
WHEN HE FINALLY GETS THERE, IF EVER.

427
00:36:03,628 --> 00:36:05,596
I'LL SEE YOU LATER.

428
00:36:12,870 --> 00:36:15,239
( thunder rumbling )

429
00:36:17,742 --> 00:36:21,445
( phone ringing )

430
00:36:29,453 --> 00:36:32,723
( ringing continues )

431
00:36:32,757 --> 00:36:37,595
IAN, IT'S FOR YOU. IT'S YOUR WIFE.

432
00:36:52,343 --> 00:36:54,512
CAN YOU IDENTIFY THE BODY, SIR?

433
00:36:54,545 --> 00:36:57,748
WHY ASK HIM? BODY'S BURNT BEYOND RECOGNITION.

434
00:36:57,782 --> 00:36:59,050
EVEN THE CORONER HAD A DIFFICULT TIME

435
00:36:59,083 --> 00:37:01,619
MATCHING UP THE DENTAL RECORDS.

436
00:37:01,652 --> 00:37:06,257
- MR. LAZARRE? - YOU OKAY TO DRIVE, DOCTOR?

437
00:37:07,992 --> 00:37:09,560
DOCTOR?

438
00:37:10,661 --> 00:37:13,564
( water running in toilet )

439
00:37:46,797 --> 00:37:47,965
HEY!

440
00:38:06,117 --> 00:38:08,085
HEY, THIS AREA'S OFF LIMITS.

441
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:10,621
- I WANNA USE THE TELEPHONE. - COME WITH ME!

442
00:38:10,655 --> 00:38:12,723
- GET YOUR HANDS OFF ME! - COME ON!

443
00:38:12,757 --> 00:38:14,125
LET GO OF ME!

444
00:38:14,158 --> 00:38:16,727
WHAT SEEMS TO BE THE PROBLEM?

445
00:38:16,761 --> 00:38:18,696
DR. RENQUIST.

446
00:38:18,729 --> 00:38:20,798
YES,

447
00:38:20,831 --> 00:38:23,434
I JUST WANTED TO MAKE A CALL.

448
00:38:28,105 --> 00:38:31,542
I JUST WANTED TO CALL SOMEBODY.

449
00:38:31,575 --> 00:38:34,779
YOU WANT TO LEAVE US, DON'T YOU?

450
00:38:34,812 --> 00:38:36,814
NO.

451
00:38:36,847 --> 00:38:39,050
I JUST WANNA CALL SOMEONE.

452
00:38:39,083 --> 00:38:42,787
WELL, THERE'S A TELEPHONE.

453
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:44,955
YOU WANT TO USE IT? GO AHEAD. USE IT.

454
00:38:44,989 --> 00:38:47,591
GO AHEAD.

455
00:38:50,995 --> 00:38:54,899
- GO AHEAD. - I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

456
00:38:54,932 --> 00:38:59,070
IT'S REVERSE PSYCHOLOGY 101.

457
00:38:59,103 --> 00:39:02,039
GO AHEAD. USE THE TELEPHONE.

458
00:39:21,926 --> 00:39:25,529
STEP OUT OF LINE, AND WE PUNISH YOU. IT'S VERY SIMPLE.

459
00:39:25,563 --> 00:39:28,499
WE HAVE A "THREE STRIKES, YOU'RE OUT" RULE, IAN.

460
00:39:28,532 --> 00:39:31,736
ONLY HERE, OUT MEANS IN.

461
00:39:31,769 --> 00:39:33,771
YOU STAY IN FOR AS LONG AS IT TAKES.

462
00:39:33,804 --> 00:39:35,506
DO I MAKE MYSELF CLEAR?

463
00:39:35,539 --> 00:39:37,775
THIS ISN'T REHAB.

464
00:39:37,808 --> 00:39:39,910
YOU DON'T HAVE THE RIGHT TO COMMIT ME.

465
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:43,848
REALLY?

466
00:39:45,015 --> 00:39:47,051
I'LL HAVE TO SEE ABOUT THAT.

467
00:39:47,084 --> 00:39:50,654
James: IT'S OKAY. IT'S GONNA BE ALL RIGHT.

468
00:40:28,559 --> 00:40:30,861
GOOD EVENING. CAN I GET YOU A DRINK BEFORE DINNER?

469
00:40:32,062 --> 00:40:34,799
COFFEE.

470
00:40:34,832 --> 00:40:36,534
SAME FOR ME.

471
00:40:38,035 --> 00:40:40,838
SO HAVE YOU TALKED TO IAN? IT'S BEEN A WEEK.

472
00:40:40,871 --> 00:40:42,206
I'M SURE HE'S FINE.

473
00:40:42,239 --> 00:40:44,175
HE'S A FIGHTER. HE'LL MAKE IT.

474
00:40:44,208 --> 00:40:46,710
IF HE DOESN'T...

475
00:40:46,744 --> 00:40:49,914
WHAT DO YOU MEAN, IF HE DOESN'T?

476
00:40:49,947 --> 00:40:51,882
I DIDN'T WANNA UPSET YOU,

477
00:40:51,916 --> 00:40:53,851
BUT I THINK YOU OUGHTA KNOW.

478
00:40:53,884 --> 00:40:55,986
I GOT A CALL FROM IAN'S DOCTOR, DR. RENQUIST.

479
00:40:56,020 --> 00:40:58,322
HIS RECOVERY'S NOT GOING VERY WELL.

480
00:40:58,355 --> 00:41:01,659
- APPARENTLY, THERE'S SOME PROBLEMS. - WHAT KIND OF PROBLEMS?

481
00:41:01,692 --> 00:41:03,961
NOTHING SERIOUS. NOT YET. IT'S JUST...

482
00:41:03,994 --> 00:41:06,997
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? JUST SPIT IT OUT.

483
00:41:07,031 --> 00:41:08,899
LOOK, TERESA,

484
00:41:08,933 --> 00:41:11,101
I THINK YOU'VE GOTTA EXPECT THE WORST.

485
00:41:11,135 --> 00:41:13,270
IF HIS REHAB ISN'T SUCCESSFUL,

486
00:41:13,304 --> 00:41:16,073
THEY'RE GONNA HAVE TO TAKE THE TREATMENT TO THE NEXT LEVEL.

487
00:41:16,106 --> 00:41:18,909
- WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? - NONE OF US WANTS THAT TO HAPPEN.

488
00:41:20,077 --> 00:41:22,146
AS YOUR FRIEND,

489
00:41:22,179 --> 00:41:24,949
AS IAN'S BEST FRIEND, AND HIS APPOINTED LAWYER,

490
00:41:24,982 --> 00:41:27,184
WE GOTTA START THINKING ABOUT OUR RESPONSIBILITIES,

491
00:41:27,218 --> 00:41:29,787
LEGAL AND OTHERWISE, TO IAN.

492
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:32,189
GREAT.

493
00:41:36,026 --> 00:41:38,128
SO, JOE, CAN I BUY YOU A DRINK?

494
00:41:38,162 --> 00:41:39,964
YEAH.

495
00:42:13,998 --> 00:42:15,699
WELL, GOOD MORNING, IAN.

496
00:42:15,733 --> 00:42:18,068
HOW ARE YOU THIS MORNING?

497
00:42:18,102 --> 00:42:21,338
NOT TOO GOOD.

498
00:42:21,372 --> 00:42:23,674
I'M SORRY TO HEAR THAT.

499
00:42:30,881 --> 00:42:32,683
THANK YOU, JAMES.

500
00:42:32,716 --> 00:42:37,288
IS THAT FOR ME? THAT'S VERY THOUGHTFUL.

501
00:42:37,321 --> 00:42:40,958
DR. RENQUIST SAID THAT YOU WERE FEELING A LITTLE ANXIOUS EARLIER,

502
00:42:40,991 --> 00:42:43,160
AND THAT WE SHOULD GIVE YOU SOMETHING TO HELP YOU SLEEP.

503
00:42:43,193 --> 00:42:45,095
THAT'S VERY PROFESSIONAL.

504
00:42:45,129 --> 00:42:48,265
DID YOU EVER THINK OF WORKING FOR A PRIVATE PRACTICE?

505
00:42:48,299 --> 00:42:51,001
- IS THAT A PROPOSITION? - NO.

506
00:42:52,336 --> 00:42:54,004
LAY DOWN.

507
00:42:55,239 --> 00:42:57,007
AND RELAX.

508
00:43:00,144 --> 00:43:02,446
I'D LIKE TO ASK YOU SOMETHING.

509
00:43:02,479 --> 00:43:06,050
OKAY, IAN.

510
00:43:06,083 --> 00:43:09,920
WHAT'S IT LIKE WORKING FOR DR. RENQUIST?

511
00:43:09,954 --> 00:43:14,458
OH, HE'S A WONDERFUL MAN. A WONDERFUL MAN.

512
00:43:14,491 --> 00:43:17,261
I DON'T KNOW WHERE YOU'D BE WITHOUT HIM.

513
00:43:17,294 --> 00:43:19,897
WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT HIS RESEARCH?

514
00:43:19,930 --> 00:43:22,099
HE HELPS PEOPLE LIKE YOU.

515
00:43:22,132 --> 00:43:24,368
- HE HELPS PEOPLE. - YES.

516
00:43:24,401 --> 00:43:27,004
PEOPLE WITH PROBLEMS,

517
00:43:27,037 --> 00:43:29,139
AND SECRETS,

518
00:43:29,173 --> 00:43:31,909
AND PEOPLE WHO CAN'T SLEEP.

519
00:43:31,942 --> 00:43:33,477
HOW DO YOU KNOW I CAN'T SLEEP?

520
00:43:33,510 --> 00:43:35,346
WELL, UH...

521
00:43:52,096 --> 00:43:54,098
IAN, I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU THIS SHOT,

522
00:43:54,131 --> 00:43:57,167
AND YOU'RE GONNA FEEL... YOU'RE GONNA FEEL BETTER.

523
00:43:59,269 --> 00:44:01,905
WHAT'S IN IT? WHAT IS IT?

524
00:44:01,939 --> 00:44:03,907
I AM A DOCTOR. I CAN TAKE IT.

525
00:44:03,941 --> 00:44:05,843
I KNOW THAT YOU CAN.

526
00:44:05,876 --> 00:44:08,278
- TELL ME WHAT IT IS. - I KNOW YOU CAN.

527
00:44:13,183 --> 00:44:16,053
I CAN'T CLOSE MY EYES.

528
00:44:26,930 --> 00:44:28,198
THANK YOU, JAMES.

529
00:44:30,067 --> 00:44:33,203
I'D LIKE TO ASK YOU SOMETHING.

530
00:44:33,237 --> 00:44:35,472
OKAY, IAN.

531
00:44:35,506 --> 00:44:40,477
WHAT'S IT LIKE WORKING FOR DR. RENQUIST?

532
00:44:40,511 --> 00:44:44,214
WELL, HE'S A WONDERFUL MAN. A WONDERFUL MAN.

533
00:44:46,984 --> 00:44:51,188
JONAS, PLEASE.

534
00:45:23,153 --> 00:45:25,255
PLEASE.

535
00:45:26,223 --> 00:45:27,958
PLEASE.

536
00:45:29,193 --> 00:45:31,795
GET ME OUT OF HERE!

537
00:46:45,569 --> 00:46:47,938
ARE YOU FEELING A LITTLE LESS ANXIOUS?

538
00:46:47,971 --> 00:46:50,073
HMM?

539
00:46:53,410 --> 00:46:56,613
YOU LIKE PEOPLE TO FEEL SORRY FOR YOU.

540
00:46:56,647 --> 00:46:58,549
DON'T YOU?

541
00:47:00,250 --> 00:47:03,687
BUT THERE AREN'T ENOUGH PEOPLE WHO DO.

542
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:06,223
YOUR WIFE DOESN'T.

543
00:47:06,256 --> 00:47:10,460
DOES SHE? NOT LIKE THIS.

544
00:47:24,308 --> 00:47:25,576
WHAT'S IT GONNA BE?

545
00:47:25,609 --> 00:47:30,080
YOU WANNA STAY IN, OR YOU WANNA STAY OUT?

546
00:47:30,113 --> 00:47:32,282
WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME?

547
00:47:34,751 --> 00:47:38,422
NO, IAN, THE QUESTION IS,

548
00:47:38,455 --> 00:47:40,691
WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME?

549
00:47:46,330 --> 00:47:48,031
HELP.

550
00:47:50,634 --> 00:47:54,338
- HELP YOURSELF FOR ONCE. - PLEASE.

551
00:47:57,140 --> 00:48:00,310
GET ME OUT OF HERE.

552
00:48:00,344 --> 00:48:02,446
( voice echoes )

553
00:48:23,133 --> 00:48:25,569
GOOD MORNING, IAN. HOW ARE YOU FEELING?

554
00:48:25,602 --> 00:48:28,372
SWEET DREAMS?

555
00:48:28,405 --> 00:48:30,073
NO.

556
00:48:30,107 --> 00:48:32,409
OH, I'M SORRY.

557
00:48:32,442 --> 00:48:35,412
WELL, THE GOOD NEWS IS,

558
00:48:35,445 --> 00:48:38,782
THAT THE WEEK IS UP, AND YOU HAVE VISITORS.

559
00:48:38,815 --> 00:48:42,286
THEY'RE WAITING FOR YOU IN THE CAFETERIA.

560
00:48:46,690 --> 00:48:48,659
THIS WAY.

561
00:49:02,372 --> 00:49:04,341
THIS WAY.

562
00:49:08,812 --> 00:49:12,449
SO, IAN, THEY'RE ALL WAITING FOR YOU.

563
00:49:12,482 --> 00:49:14,484
TERESA AND JOE.

564
00:49:16,553 --> 00:49:20,123
NOW, IAN, YOU STAY HERE. I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

565
00:49:32,769 --> 00:49:34,504
SHALL WE?

566
00:49:41,545 --> 00:49:43,413
AFTER YOU.

567
00:50:11,675 --> 00:50:15,645
( no audible dialogue )

568
00:50:24,421 --> 00:50:26,523
YOU HAVE 15 MINUTES.

569
00:50:38,535 --> 00:50:41,705
JOE SPOKE WITH DR. RENQUIST YESTERDAY ON THE TELEPHONE.

570
00:50:41,738 --> 00:50:44,775
HE FELT IT WOULD BE NICE IF WE CAME UP FOR A VISIT

571
00:50:44,808 --> 00:50:47,310
TO SEE HOW YOU'RE DOING.

572
00:50:47,344 --> 00:50:49,413
HOW DO I LOOK?

573
00:50:51,214 --> 00:50:53,517
LOOK, WHY DON'T YOU GUYS TALK?

574
00:50:53,550 --> 00:50:56,086
I'LL BE BACK IN A WHILE.

575
00:50:58,388 --> 00:51:00,457
HE'S CONCERNED ABOUT YOU.

576
00:51:00,490 --> 00:51:04,294
- YOU SCARED HIM PRETTY BADLY. - DID I?

577
00:51:04,327 --> 00:51:07,130
SIT DOWN.

578
00:51:07,164 --> 00:51:09,566
YEAH, AND ME, TOO.

579
00:51:11,334 --> 00:51:12,769
TERESA, I--

580
00:51:12,803 --> 00:51:15,572
PLEASE. DON'T SAY ANYTHING.

581
00:51:15,605 --> 00:51:17,507
YOU NEED HELP.

582
00:51:17,541 --> 00:51:19,576
THAT'S ALL THERE IS TO SAY.

583
00:51:24,247 --> 00:51:26,483
ALL THESE YEARS,

584
00:51:26,516 --> 00:51:31,354
TREATING PEOPLE.

585
00:51:31,388 --> 00:51:33,490
LECTURING OTHER PSYCHIATRISTS

586
00:51:33,523 --> 00:51:36,860
ON HOW TO TREAT PEOPLE.

587
00:51:36,893 --> 00:51:40,297
OH! LOOK AT ME. LOOK AT ME. DID I DO THIS?

588
00:51:40,330 --> 00:51:43,300
IAN, PLEASE STOP.

589
00:51:43,333 --> 00:51:45,936
LOOK AT ME. ALL THE GRANTS, THE FELLOWSHIPS,

590
00:51:45,969 --> 00:51:48,538
THE RESEARCH, EVERYTHING.

591
00:51:48,572 --> 00:51:50,607
I'M WORSE NOW THAN WHEN I STARTED.

592
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:52,309
I CAN'T EVEN HELP MYSELF.

593
00:51:52,342 --> 00:51:53,910
NO ONE EXPECTS YOU TO.

594
00:51:53,944 --> 00:51:55,645
LOOK AT ME.

595
00:51:55,679 --> 00:51:59,649
I CAN'T EVEN TAKE CARE OF MYSELF.

596
00:51:59,683 --> 00:52:01,852
THAT'S WHY YOU'RE HERE.

597
00:52:03,620 --> 00:52:05,689
JUST LET THEM HELP YOU.

598
00:52:11,628 --> 00:52:13,563
I WANNA GO HOME.

599
00:52:13,597 --> 00:52:17,634
I DON'T BELONG HERE.

600
00:52:17,667 --> 00:52:22,372
TERESA, I'M SCARED OF THIS PLACE.

601
00:52:22,405 --> 00:52:25,942
IT CAN BE BETTER. I DON'T WANNA BE SICK.

602
00:52:25,976 --> 00:52:28,411
I DON'T WANNA DRINK ANYMORE.

603
00:52:28,445 --> 00:52:30,680
LISTEN TO ME. IT WILL BE BETTER.

604
00:52:30,714 --> 00:52:34,351
GOD, IAN. LISTEN TO YOURSELF.

605
00:52:34,384 --> 00:52:37,787
DO YOU EVEN HEAR WHAT YOU'RE SAYING?

606
00:52:37,821 --> 00:52:41,625
YOU DON'T EVEN REALIZE YOU HAVE A PROBLEM, DO YOU?

607
00:52:44,261 --> 00:52:45,762
WE HAVE TO GO.

608
00:52:47,631 --> 00:52:49,666
I DON'T WANNA BE ALONE.

609
00:52:49,699 --> 00:52:51,635
I CAN'T STAND BEING ALONE.

610
00:52:51,668 --> 00:52:53,737
IAN, PLEASE.

611
00:52:53,770 --> 00:52:56,840
FINISH WHAT YOU STARTED.

612
00:52:56,873 --> 00:52:59,809
- PROMISE ME ONE THING. - WHAT?

613
00:52:59,843 --> 00:53:04,915
WILL YOU BE THERE WHEN I GET OUT?

614
00:53:04,948 --> 00:53:06,983
I DON'T KNOW.

615
00:53:07,017 --> 00:53:09,653
WE'LL SEE.

616
00:53:15,592 --> 00:53:17,727
QUITE A PLACE, IAN.

617
00:53:17,761 --> 00:53:19,930
KILLER NURSING STAFF.

618
00:53:19,963 --> 00:53:22,799
JOE, WE HAVE TO GO. IT'S GETTING LATE.

619
00:53:28,672 --> 00:53:31,841
- IS SHE OKAY? - I DON'T KNOW.

620
00:53:33,910 --> 00:53:37,647
LISTEN, I'M REALLY SORRY ABOUT ALL THIS, BUDDY,

621
00:53:37,681 --> 00:53:41,418
BUT TERESA INSISTED SHE KNEW WHAT WAS BEST FOR YOU.

622
00:53:41,451 --> 00:53:45,055
I TOLD HER THAT I THOUGHT YOU COULD SOBER UP FINE BY YOURSELF,

623
00:53:45,088 --> 00:53:47,891
BUT SHE SAID THIS WAS GONNA BE GOOD FOR YOU.

624
00:53:47,924 --> 00:53:50,427
YOU'VE GOTTA GET ME OUT OF HERE.

625
00:53:50,460 --> 00:53:53,697
JOE, YOU GOT TO GET ME THE FUCK OUT OF HERE.

626
00:53:53,730 --> 00:53:56,666
I WILL, I WILL. NO PROBLEM, NO PROBLEM.

627
00:53:58,802 --> 00:54:02,405
HEY, YOU NEED ANYTHING, YOU CALL ME, ALL RIGHT?

628
00:54:03,406 --> 00:54:05,075
TAKE CARE OF TERESA, WILL YOU?

629
00:54:05,108 --> 00:54:07,077
I WILL.

630
00:54:10,947 --> 00:54:13,416
I'LL SEE YA, ALL RIGHT?

631
00:55:10,940 --> 00:55:13,143
WELCOME, IAN.

632
00:55:13,176 --> 00:55:15,445
HOW DO YOU FEEL TODAY?

633
00:55:15,478 --> 00:55:17,781
WELL, LET'S SEE.

634
00:55:17,814 --> 00:55:20,950
ACUTE WITHDRAWAL, AND ASSOCIATED SYMPTOMS

635
00:55:20,984 --> 00:55:24,020
OF DETOXIFICATION SUBSIDED ABOUT A WEEK AGO.

636
00:55:24,054 --> 00:55:26,122
THE ONSET OF CHEMICAL DEPRESSION

637
00:55:26,156 --> 00:55:29,059
TOOK PLACE SHORTLY THEREAFTER,

638
00:55:29,092 --> 00:55:31,061
AND OCCASIONAL BOUTS WITH NAUSEA,

639
00:55:31,094 --> 00:55:33,596
WHICH WAS TO BE EXPECTED.

640
00:55:33,630 --> 00:55:38,668
PAIN IN MY KIDNEYS FROM THE JUNK THAT YOU'VE BEEN GIVING ME.

641
00:55:38,702 --> 00:55:41,838
OTHER THAN THAT, I'M ON TOP OF THE FUCKING WORLD.

642
00:55:41,871 --> 00:55:43,973
GOOD. I GUESS I SHOULD HAVE EXPECTED THAT

643
00:55:44,007 --> 00:55:48,144
FROM A DOCTOR WITH YOUR BACKGROUND AND QUALIFICATIONS.

644
00:55:48,178 --> 00:55:51,815
HOW ARE YOUR SPIRITS, IAN?

645
00:55:51,848 --> 00:55:53,817
MY SPIRITS?

646
00:55:53,850 --> 00:55:56,853
MY SPIRITS.

647
00:55:56,886 --> 00:55:58,788
IS THAT A FUCKIN' JOKE?

648
00:55:58,822 --> 00:56:00,757
YOU WANT ME TO LAY DOWN ON THE TABLE,

649
00:56:00,790 --> 00:56:02,826
AND TELL YOU ALL ABOUT IT?

650
00:56:04,928 --> 00:56:07,497
I'M SURE YOU WILL.

651
00:56:09,666 --> 00:56:11,868
HOW DID YOUR FIRST WIFE DIE?

652
00:56:11,901 --> 00:56:15,105
NO. I DON'T WANT TO GET INTO THIS FUCKING GAME.

653
00:56:15,138 --> 00:56:17,841
YOU KNOW THAT I'M ALL CLEANED UP.

654
00:56:17,874 --> 00:56:19,943
I DON'T HAVE TO BE HERE.

655
00:56:19,976 --> 00:56:22,846
LOOK, I'M JUST TRYING TO HELP YOU.

656
00:56:22,879 --> 00:56:24,748
THERE'S NO REASON FOR YOU TO BE SO DEFENSIVE.

657
00:56:24,781 --> 00:56:26,082
WE'RE ALL FRIENDS HERE.

658
00:56:26,116 --> 00:56:29,719
OH, YEAH, WE'RE ALL JUST ONE BIG HAPPY FAMILY.

659
00:56:29,753 --> 00:56:32,122
DON'T YOU THINK I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING?

660
00:56:32,155 --> 00:56:34,824
I'VE TREATED ADDICTS FOR YEARS.

661
00:56:34,858 --> 00:56:37,894
ONE THING I KNOW IS YOU DON'T RESTRAIN OR PHYSICALLY ABUSE

662
00:56:37,927 --> 00:56:39,896
PATIENTS IN REHAB.

663
00:56:39,929 --> 00:56:42,198
NOW LET'S CUT THE SHIT. CALL MY WIFE AND TELL HER

664
00:56:42,232 --> 00:56:43,967
TO GET ME THE FUCK OUT OF HERE.

665
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,569
PERHAPS YOU'RE HAVING A LITTLE TROUBLE UNDERSTANDING

666
00:56:46,603 --> 00:56:48,705
WHAT WE'RE ALL ABOUT HERE AT BLACKHURST.

667
00:56:48,738 --> 00:56:50,940
HELL, SHIT, I AM.

668
00:56:52,609 --> 00:56:55,912
YOU'RE A VERY SPECIAL CASE, IAN,

669
00:56:57,847 --> 00:57:00,717
AND FOR REASONS THAT MIGHT EVEN SURPRISE YOU.

670
00:57:00,750 --> 00:57:03,920
YOU KNOW, YOU THINK TOO MUCH.

671
00:57:03,953 --> 00:57:06,890
ALL RIGHT, LET'S ASSUME THAT YOU GO BACK HOME.

672
00:57:06,923 --> 00:57:08,124
EVERYTHING'S BACK TO NORMAL.

673
00:57:08,158 --> 00:57:10,493
THEN EVENTUALLY, YOU'LL GO OUT TO DINNER,

674
00:57:10,527 --> 00:57:12,929
THE WAITER WILL ASK YOU WHAT YOU WANT TO DRINK.

675
00:57:12,962 --> 00:57:15,765
AND AT THAT MOMENT, YOU WILL HAVE YOUR DOUBTS.

676
00:57:15,799 --> 00:57:17,901
- BULLSHIT. - THEY ALL DO.

677
00:57:17,934 --> 00:57:19,936
AND YOU'LL SAY NO,

678
00:57:19,969 --> 00:57:22,972
BECAUSE YOU FEEL SO CONFIDENT ABOUT YOURSELF.

679
00:57:23,006 --> 00:57:24,574
AND EVERYONE WILL SAY, OH, GOOD OLD IAN.

680
00:57:24,607 --> 00:57:26,543
HE'S FINALLY CLEANED UP HIS ACT.

681
00:57:26,576 --> 00:57:30,914
YES, IAN, YOU THINK YOU'VE BEATEN IT.

682
00:57:30,947 --> 00:57:35,051
BUT THE TRUTH IS, THE CLOCK IS TICKING.

683
00:57:35,084 --> 00:57:37,854
YES, THE FUSE IS BURNING.

684
00:57:37,887 --> 00:57:41,257
YOU KNOW YOU'RE GOING TO TAKE THAT DRINK SOME TIME.

685
00:57:41,291 --> 00:57:44,227
YES, YOU KNOW IT'S INEVITABLE.

686
00:57:44,260 --> 00:57:46,996
BECAUSE YOU STILL HAVEN'T FOUND WHERE THE TRUTH LIES.

687
00:57:47,030 --> 00:57:49,666
IT'S AS SIMPLE AS THAT.

688
00:57:49,699 --> 00:57:51,334
SO I'VE GOT A DRINKING PROBLEM.

689
00:57:51,367 --> 00:57:52,936
PEOPLE HAVE PROBLEMS.

690
00:57:52,969 --> 00:57:55,905
BUT MINE IS NOT A NEUROLOGICAL OR A BIOLOGICAL DISORDER

691
00:57:55,939 --> 00:57:58,007
THAT NEEDS SOME GODDAMN DRUG.

692
00:57:58,041 --> 00:58:00,009
I AM NOT A MENTAL PATIENT.

693
00:58:00,043 --> 00:58:02,779
AND YOU CAN'T KEEP ME HERE!

694
00:58:06,616 --> 00:58:08,084
NO, I'M NOT CRAZY.

695
00:58:08,117 --> 00:58:10,119
I'M NOT CRAZY.

696
00:58:10,153 --> 00:58:12,622
- I'M NOT CRAZY. - ALL RIGHT, IAN, JUST RELAX.

697
00:58:12,655 --> 00:58:15,058
I'M NOT CRAZY. I'M NOT CRAZY.

698
00:58:15,091 --> 00:58:18,928
I'M NOT CRAZY. OH, GOD!

699
00:58:18,962 --> 00:58:20,997
IT'S FOR YOUR OWN GOOD. YOU'LL SEE.

700
00:58:21,030 --> 00:58:24,000
( Ian weeping )

701
00:58:24,033 --> 00:58:27,704
WHAT IS THAT? WHAT IS IT? WHAT IS IT?

702
00:58:27,737 --> 00:58:31,207
- IT'S WHATEVER YOU WANT IT TO BE. - NO!!

703
00:58:31,241 --> 00:58:34,177
OH, I'M NOT CRAZY!

704
00:58:35,979 --> 00:58:38,147
I'M NOT CRAZY.

705
00:59:32,001 --> 00:59:34,137
Joe: JUST LIKE OLD TIMES, EH, BUDDY?

706
01:00:02,031 --> 01:00:04,934
( maniacal laughter )

707
01:00:06,369 --> 01:00:11,941
IAN, FRIENDS DON'T LET FRIENDS DRIVE DRUNK.

708
01:00:40,069 --> 01:00:42,071
JUST LIKE OLD TIMES, EH, BUDDY?

709
01:00:46,209 --> 01:00:47,744
SOME FRIEND.

710
01:01:00,323 --> 01:01:02,225
YOU BIT YOUR TONGUE.

711
01:01:07,764 --> 01:01:09,932
SHE KNEW HIM.

712
01:01:09,966 --> 01:01:12,001
SHE KNEW HIM.

713
01:01:13,903 --> 01:01:15,405
IT'S OKAY, IAN.

714
01:01:15,438 --> 01:01:19,308
- SHE KNEW HIM. - JUST RELAX.

715
01:01:19,342 --> 01:01:21,177
TELL US ABOUT YOUR DREAM, IAN.

716
01:01:21,210 --> 01:01:25,081
YOU'RE BEGINNING TO UNDERSTAND, AREN'T YOU?

717
01:01:25,114 --> 01:01:26,849
BEGINNING TO SEE THE TRUTH.

718
01:01:26,883 --> 01:01:29,318
IT'S NOT WITHDRAWAL THAT YOU'RE SUFFERING FROM.

719
01:01:29,352 --> 01:01:32,188
IT'S YOU.

720
01:01:32,221 --> 01:01:34,524
IN HERE.

721
01:01:34,557 --> 01:01:37,493
TRUST WHAT'S HAPPENING TO YOU, DON'T FIGHT IT.

722
01:01:50,073 --> 01:01:52,508
( alarm blares )

723
01:02:06,489 --> 01:02:07,990
RIGHT HERE.

724
01:02:08,024 --> 01:02:11,027
SORRY, GUY. YOU ALL RIGHT?

725
01:02:11,060 --> 01:02:13,096
THERE YOU GO.

726
01:02:13,129 --> 01:02:15,398
LITTLE FOOTSIES IN HERE.

727
01:02:15,431 --> 01:02:17,967
HUH? LET ME SEE.

728
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,269
IT'S ALL RIGHT, IT'S OKAY.

729
01:02:20,303 --> 01:02:21,571
THERE'S A WHOLE LOT GOIN' ON

730
01:02:21,604 --> 01:02:24,006
IN THAT LITTLE BITTY MIND OF HIS.

731
01:02:24,040 --> 01:02:26,142
JAMES, THAT'S ENOUGH NOW.

732
01:02:26,175 --> 01:02:27,376
OKAY.

733
01:02:32,048 --> 01:02:34,150
EVERYTHING'S GONNA BE OKAY.

734
01:02:34,183 --> 01:02:37,320
YOU'RE GONNA GET BETTER SOON.

735
01:02:39,322 --> 01:02:41,290
YES, YOU WILL.

736
01:02:41,324 --> 01:02:43,292
YES, YOU'LL SEE.

737
01:02:45,361 --> 01:02:47,396
YOU TRUST ME.

738
01:02:48,931 --> 01:02:50,900
TRUST ME.

739
01:03:04,347 --> 01:03:07,083
DOCTOR, I DON'T THINK THAT'S APPROPRIATE.

740
01:03:12,221 --> 01:03:14,257
NOW, NIGHTY-NIGHT.

741
01:03:55,998 --> 01:03:57,466
JOE, IT'S TERESA.

742
01:03:57,500 --> 01:03:59,569
I MEAN, MRS. LAZARRE HERE TO SEE YOU.

743
01:03:59,602 --> 01:04:01,404
SEND HER IN.

744
01:04:02,705 --> 01:04:05,341
HI. THIS WAS A SURPRISE.

745
01:04:06,742 --> 01:04:09,579
- JOE, LISTEN, WE NEED TO TALK. - WHAT'S THE MATTER?

746
01:04:09,612 --> 01:04:12,348
IT'S ABOUT IAN. I NEED TO SEE HIM AGAIN.

747
01:04:12,381 --> 01:04:14,517
YOU SURE THAT'S A GOOD IDEA?

748
01:04:14,550 --> 01:04:17,153
YOU KNOW HOW FRAGILE HE IS.

749
01:04:17,186 --> 01:04:19,522
SOMETHING IS NOT RIGHT. I KNOW HIM.

750
01:04:19,555 --> 01:04:21,457
HE WOULDN'T GET LIKE THIS.

751
01:04:21,490 --> 01:04:24,360
LOOK, TERESA, YOU'RE NOT BEING VERY OBJECTIVE.

752
01:04:24,393 --> 01:04:27,230
DID YOU MEAN WHAT YOU SAID ABOUT THE POWER OF ATTORNEY?

753
01:04:27,263 --> 01:04:29,398
ABOUT TAKING THE TREATMENT TO THE SECOND LEVEL?

754
01:04:29,432 --> 01:04:32,068
LOOK, I DON'T WANNA DO THAT ANY MORE THAN YOU DO, BUT...

755
01:04:32,101 --> 01:04:34,370
BUT?

756
01:04:36,172 --> 01:04:38,407
LOOK, WHY DON'T WE TALK ABOUT IT TONIGHT?

757
01:04:38,441 --> 01:04:39,475
I'LL COME OVER, OKAY?

758
01:04:39,508 --> 01:04:42,278
FINE. I NEED TO SEE HIM.

759
01:04:42,311 --> 01:04:44,180
YOU WILL, YOU WILL. WE'LL TALK ABOUT IT OVER DINNER.

760
01:04:44,213 --> 01:04:45,548
OKAY.

761
01:05:05,301 --> 01:05:07,470
JAMES, WOULD YOU GIVE US A SECOND, PLEASE?

762
01:05:07,503 --> 01:05:09,272
ARE YOU SURE?

763
01:05:09,305 --> 01:05:12,074
LOOK AT HIM. HE'S NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

764
01:05:18,648 --> 01:05:20,416
IT'S OKAY.

765
01:05:24,420 --> 01:05:26,355
WHERE DID RENQUIST FIND YOU?

766
01:05:26,389 --> 01:05:27,990
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

767
01:05:32,161 --> 01:05:34,030
ON THE STRIP?

768
01:05:34,063 --> 01:05:37,266
TURNING TRICKS FOR A FIX.

769
01:05:39,535 --> 01:05:41,504
IT'S OKAY.

770
01:05:43,372 --> 01:05:45,675
IAN, I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

771
01:05:50,346 --> 01:05:54,650
YOU'RE NOT EVEN A CERTIFIED NURSE, ARE YOU?

772
01:05:54,684 --> 01:05:57,420
ARE YOU?

773
01:05:58,754 --> 01:06:00,623
IAN, LET US HELP YOU.

774
01:06:02,491 --> 01:06:06,495
IF YOU WANNA HELP ME, YOU'LL HELP ME GET OUTTA HERE.

775
01:06:07,730 --> 01:06:11,233
James: DINNERTIME. ARE YOU READY?

776
01:06:15,571 --> 01:06:17,473
HOPE YOU'RE HUNGRY.

777
01:07:56,439 --> 01:08:00,509
( phone ringing )

778
01:08:06,348 --> 01:08:08,217
HELLO.

779
01:08:09,652 --> 01:08:11,520
HELLO?

780
01:08:16,292 --> 01:08:18,194
WHO WAS IT?

781
01:08:18,227 --> 01:08:21,564
I DON'T KNOW. PROBABLY A WRONG NUMBER.

782
01:08:30,539 --> 01:08:34,243
UM, LISTEN, I HAVE AN EARLY DAY TOMORROW.

783
01:08:34,276 --> 01:08:36,679
ALL RIGHT.

784
01:08:36,712 --> 01:08:40,349
I JUST NEED TO GO OVER SOME POWER OF ATTORNEY DOCUMENTS FOR IAN.

785
01:08:47,790 --> 01:08:50,459
- JOE, WHAT ARE YOU DOING? - COME ON, COME ON.

786
01:08:52,962 --> 01:08:54,530
( phone ringing )

787
01:08:54,563 --> 01:08:56,665
WHY DON'T YOU LET ME GET THIS?

788
01:08:58,667 --> 01:09:01,203
- HELLO. - JOE?

789
01:09:06,442 --> 01:09:08,544
WHO WAS IT?

790
01:09:08,577 --> 01:09:10,713
OH, NOBODY. JUST A PRANK CALL.

791
01:09:20,689 --> 01:09:21,724
STRIKE THREE, IAN.

792
01:09:27,863 --> 01:09:30,266
LET ME OUTTA HERE!

793
01:09:30,299 --> 01:09:32,735
YOU'RE SO CLOSE TO THE TRUTH.

794
01:09:32,768 --> 01:09:35,271
YOU HAVE NO IDEA.

795
01:09:42,545 --> 01:09:43,946
( truck horn blares )

796
01:10:07,469 --> 01:10:09,705
JESUS CHRIST, LADY.

797
01:10:09,738 --> 01:10:11,840
YOU OKAY?

798
01:10:13,442 --> 01:10:15,945
YEAH, I'M FINE. SORRY.

799
01:11:08,697 --> 01:11:11,367
I'M SORRY THAT YOU HAVE TO SEE HIM LIKE THIS.

800
01:11:11,400 --> 01:11:13,035
OH, MY GOD, IAN.

801
01:11:25,748 --> 01:11:28,083
- POOR GUY. - ( silence )

802
01:11:31,520 --> 01:11:33,022
TERESA!

803
01:11:33,055 --> 01:11:36,825
HE'S FIGHTING SOME KIND OF BATTLE IN HIS HEAD.

804
01:11:36,859 --> 01:11:39,128
SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE DEATH OF HIS FIRST WIFE.

805
01:11:39,161 --> 01:11:40,763
WENDY?

806
01:11:40,796 --> 01:11:43,632
SHE WAS DRUNK. SHE DROVE HERSELF OFF THE ROAD.

807
01:11:43,666 --> 01:11:44,767
IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.

808
01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:46,568
WELL, NOT IN YOUR HUSBAND'S MIND.

809
01:11:46,602 --> 01:11:48,504
TERESA!!

810
01:11:48,537 --> 01:11:50,739
HE'S SO AFRAID OF REALITY

811
01:11:50,773 --> 01:11:53,542
THAT HE'S CONSTRUCTED A WHOLE PARADOXICAL DREAM WORLD

812
01:11:53,575 --> 01:11:55,711
WHERE HE CAN PLAY OUT THE PAST.

813
01:11:55,744 --> 01:11:58,147
IN OTHER WORDS, IT'S HOPELESS.

814
01:11:58,180 --> 01:12:00,049
TERESA, PLEASE!

815
01:12:00,082 --> 01:12:02,985
I DON'T KNOW, MR. McNAMARA.

816
01:12:03,018 --> 01:12:04,586
I REALLY DON'T KNOW.

817
01:12:04,620 --> 01:12:07,856
I'VE BEEN TREATING PATIENTS LIKE THIS FOR OVER 30 YEARS.

818
01:12:07,890 --> 01:12:10,159
I STILL DON'T HAVE THE SLIGHTEST REASONABLE ANSWER.

819
01:12:10,192 --> 01:12:13,762
HE'S FIGHTING THE TREATMENT.

820
01:12:13,796 --> 01:12:16,799
HE'S FIGHTING FOR HIS LIFE.

821
01:12:19,835 --> 01:12:22,471
- I'VE SEEN ENOUGH. - YOU OKAY?

822
01:12:22,504 --> 01:12:25,174
YEAH. I'M FINE.

823
01:12:25,207 --> 01:12:26,742
TERESA!

824
01:12:26,775 --> 01:12:30,479
I CAN'T HELP YOU.

825
01:12:30,512 --> 01:12:32,848
I CAN'T HELP YOU.

826
01:12:34,817 --> 01:12:36,652
I'LL BE OUT IN A MINUTE.

827
01:12:43,125 --> 01:12:45,527
I CAN'T HELP YOU, TERESA.

828
01:13:15,557 --> 01:13:17,726
IAN.

829
01:13:20,662 --> 01:13:23,766
IAN, GET INTO BED NOW. NOW, GET IN THERE.

830
01:13:37,780 --> 01:13:40,482
COME ON. WHAT'S IN THERE?

831
01:13:40,516 --> 01:13:43,285
WHAT'S IN THAT HEAD OF YOURS?

832
01:13:43,318 --> 01:13:45,754
LET ME OUTTA HERE, RENQUIST!

833
01:13:46,889 --> 01:13:48,891
LET ME OUTTA HERE!

834
01:13:48,924 --> 01:13:51,960
LET ME OUT OF HERE!!

835
01:13:51,994 --> 01:13:55,898
( Ian's voice echoing )

836
01:13:58,667 --> 01:14:00,969
( wordless scream )

837
01:14:01,003 --> 01:14:03,205
LET ME OUT OF HERE!

838
01:14:03,238 --> 01:14:06,141
LET ME OUTTA HERE!

839
01:14:06,175 --> 01:14:09,912
RENQUIST, LET ME OUT OF HERE!

840
01:14:26,995 --> 01:14:28,630
WENDY.

841
01:14:33,769 --> 01:14:35,571
WENDY.

842
01:14:35,604 --> 01:14:38,540
YOUR WIFE WAS HERE TODAY.

843
01:14:38,574 --> 01:14:41,276
WENDY.

844
01:14:41,310 --> 01:14:43,946
YES, JUST TAKE IT EASY.

845
01:14:47,015 --> 01:14:50,018
WENDY'S DEAD.

846
01:14:50,052 --> 01:14:53,222
NOW, IAN, JUST TELL ME WHAT YOU SEE.

847
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:07,703
WELCOME TO NOWHERE.

848
01:15:07,736 --> 01:15:11,006
I WANNA KNOW THE TRUTH.

849
01:15:11,039 --> 01:15:13,909
I THOUGHT YOU CHANGED YOUR MIND.

850
01:15:18,780 --> 01:15:21,016
CAN'T YOU SHOW ME?

851
01:15:25,053 --> 01:15:28,023
WHEN THINGS GET BLACKEST,

852
01:15:28,056 --> 01:15:30,759
AND YOU DON'T KNOW WHERE TO TURN...

853
01:15:34,429 --> 01:15:38,600
REMEMBER, WHEN YOU CLOSE YOUR EYES,

854
01:15:40,802 --> 01:15:43,105
ALL YOU HAVE IS YOURSELF.

855
01:15:47,042 --> 01:15:49,778
ALL YOU HAVE IS YOURSELF.

856
01:15:52,014 --> 01:15:54,683
ALL YOU HAVE IS YOURSELF.

857
01:15:56,785 --> 01:15:58,854
ALL YOU HAVE IS YOURSELF.

858
01:16:55,410 --> 01:16:58,814
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING? - DON'T ASK, DON'T ASK.

859
01:16:58,847 --> 01:17:00,882
- ARE YOU ALL RIGHT? - YEAH.

860
01:17:00,916 --> 01:17:03,051
I ALMOST GOT MYSELF KILLED.

861
01:17:03,085 --> 01:17:05,253
I RAN INTO THE TRUCK.

862
01:17:05,287 --> 01:17:07,489
I MEAN, I ALMOST RAN INTO THE TRUCK.

863
01:17:07,522 --> 01:17:10,192
I THINK I HAD TOO MUCH CHAMPAGNE.

864
01:17:10,225 --> 01:17:12,894
- I KNOW. - ( both laughing )

865
01:17:23,138 --> 01:17:33,048
BIT OF A RUSH, ISN'T IT?

866
01:17:33,081 --> 01:17:35,217
NO.

867
01:17:35,250 --> 01:17:37,419
NO. JOE!

868
01:17:37,452 --> 01:17:39,154
DON'T!

869
01:17:39,187 --> 01:17:41,123
NO.

870
01:17:41,156 --> 01:17:43,358
JOE. DON'T.

871
01:17:43,392 --> 01:17:45,394
STOP. JOE, DON'T!

872
01:17:45,427 --> 01:17:47,162
( screams ) JOE, DON'T!

873
01:17:47,195 --> 01:17:48,497
OH, NO, NO.

874
01:17:48,530 --> 01:17:52,134
( screaming )

875
01:17:56,171 --> 01:17:57,305
LOOK AT IT.

876
01:17:57,339 --> 01:17:58,707
- NO! - ( bones snapping )

877
01:18:18,026 --> 01:18:19,928
LOOK AT IT.

878
01:18:44,453 --> 01:18:46,154
LOOK AT IT.

879
01:18:58,266 --> 01:19:00,035
OH, NO.

880
01:19:09,111 --> 01:19:11,079
WENDY.

881
01:19:13,615 --> 01:19:15,517
WENDY.

882
01:19:18,553 --> 01:19:20,455
I'M SORRY.

883
01:19:20,489 --> 01:19:22,591
I'M SORRY.

884
01:19:27,629 --> 01:19:29,498
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

885
01:19:43,979 --> 01:19:46,548
DON'T TELL ME THIS IS ONE OF MY DREAMS.

886
01:19:47,582 --> 01:19:49,217
IAN, YOU PUT THAT NEEDLE DOWN.

887
01:19:49,251 --> 01:19:52,454
THIS ISN'T GONNA SOLVE ANYTHING.

888
01:19:53,522 --> 01:19:55,857
THIS ISN'T ONE OF MY DREAMS, IS IT?

889
01:19:55,891 --> 01:19:57,659
NO.

890
01:19:57,692 --> 01:20:00,028
THEN GIVE ME THE KEYS.

891
01:20:25,253 --> 01:20:26,655
James: SHIT.

892
01:20:31,459 --> 01:20:34,196
ORDERLY.

893
01:20:34,229 --> 01:20:35,964
ORDERLY!

894
01:20:36,965 --> 01:20:39,134
OPEN IT!

895
01:20:42,504 --> 01:20:44,239
OPEN THE DOOR!

896
01:20:44,272 --> 01:20:46,708
( pounding continues )

897
01:20:46,741 --> 01:20:50,178
POOR GUY HAVIN' NIGHTMARES AGAIN, HUH?

898
01:20:50,212 --> 01:20:53,415
WHY BOTHER? THAT MOTHERFUCKER IS CRAZY.

899
01:20:53,448 --> 01:20:55,584
LET HIM ROT WITH THE REST OF 'EM.

900
01:20:55,617 --> 01:20:57,319
COME ON.

901
01:20:57,352 --> 01:21:00,322
ORDERLY! OPEN THE DOOR!

902
01:21:00,355 --> 01:21:03,191
LET'S GO OUT THERE!

903
01:21:21,309 --> 01:21:23,278
GEEZ, IAN.

904
01:21:23,311 --> 01:21:25,180
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING HERE?

905
01:21:26,514 --> 01:21:29,351
I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'VE BEEN GIVING ME.

906
01:21:29,384 --> 01:21:31,519
A NEUROLEPTIC?

907
01:21:31,553 --> 01:21:33,388
AN ANTI-PSYCHOTIC?

908
01:21:33,421 --> 01:21:36,358
BUT YOU'RE GOING TO GET ME OUT OF HERE.

909
01:21:36,391 --> 01:21:40,128
IAN, LOOK, JUST GO BACK TO YOUR ROOM. IT'S ALL RIGHT.

910
01:21:40,161 --> 01:21:42,397
YOU'VE BEEN MAKING REAL PROGRESS.

911
01:21:42,430 --> 01:21:44,399
YOU DON'T WANT TO RUIN EVERYTHING NOW.

912
01:21:44,432 --> 01:21:46,401
I THOUGHT PERHAPS YOUR TREATMENT

913
01:21:46,434 --> 01:21:48,670
WAS GONNA BRING ME THROUGH A DEPRESSION, AN OBSESSION.

914
01:21:48,703 --> 01:21:52,340
BUT THE NIGHTMARES MADE IT CLEAR.

915
01:21:52,374 --> 01:21:54,476
IAN, DON'T YOU SEE WHAT'S HAPPENED?

916
01:21:54,509 --> 01:21:56,344
YOU'VE BECOME PARANOID, DELUSIONAL.

917
01:21:56,378 --> 01:21:58,213
YOU THINK EVERYBODY'S AGAINST YOU.

918
01:21:58,246 --> 01:22:00,482
THE DRUG DIDN'T CAUSE YOUR NIGHTMARES.

919
01:22:00,515 --> 01:22:02,417
YOU YOURSELF DID.

920
01:22:02,450 --> 01:22:05,387
LOOK, THE SO-CALLED DRUG IS JUST A CATALYST.

921
01:22:07,255 --> 01:22:12,427
JOSEPH McNAMARA IS CRIMINALLY INSANE.

922
01:22:12,460 --> 01:22:15,163
HE'S GOT PATHOLOGICAL ENVY.

923
01:22:15,196 --> 01:22:18,466
HE'S... HE'S GOT A VENDETTA AGAINST ME.

924
01:22:18,500 --> 01:22:20,268
WHAT YOU'RE DOING IS UTTERLY HOPELESS.

925
01:22:20,302 --> 01:22:23,138
HE COMMITTED MURDER, AND HE RAPED MY WIFE.

926
01:22:30,345 --> 01:22:33,081
CALL SOMEBODY FOR MY LUGGAGE.

927
01:22:33,114 --> 01:22:35,317
I'M CHECKING OUT.

928
01:22:35,350 --> 01:22:37,319
OPEN IT UP.

929
01:22:37,352 --> 01:22:40,388
ORDERLY, OPEN THE DOOR!

930
01:22:50,332 --> 01:22:53,435
GO AND CALL SECURITY.

931
01:22:53,468 --> 01:22:55,770
WAIT A MINUTE. DON'T YOU HURT HIM.

932
01:22:55,804 --> 01:22:58,807
- HE PUT HIS HANDS ON YOU. - DON'T HURT HIM.

933
01:23:02,177 --> 01:23:04,312
STOP THIS NONSENSE, IAN.

934
01:23:04,346 --> 01:23:06,247
YOU'RE A SICK MAN. LET ME HELP YOU.

935
01:23:06,281 --> 01:23:07,549
ALL THIS TIME, I NEVER KNEW

936
01:23:07,582 --> 01:23:09,517
IF I WAS DREAMIN' OR I WAS AWAKE.

937
01:23:09,551 --> 01:23:12,087
JUST THINK, I COULD BE DREAMIN' RIGHT NOW.

938
01:23:12,120 --> 01:23:14,289
TAKE IT EASY, IAN. THIS IS NO DREAM.

939
01:23:14,322 --> 01:23:16,157
NO, IT'S A FUCKIN' NIGHTMARE.

940
01:23:16,191 --> 01:23:18,360
JOE PLAYED US ALL LIKE A HARP.

941
01:23:18,393 --> 01:23:20,228
YOU'RE DELIRIOUS. PLEASE, IAN.

942
01:23:20,261 --> 01:23:21,696
I NEVER FELT BETTER IN MY LIFE.

943
01:23:21,730 --> 01:23:23,531
( security alarm blaring )

944
01:23:23,565 --> 01:23:25,700
GET ME OUTTA HERE,

945
01:23:25,734 --> 01:23:29,404
OR I'M GONNA GIVE YOU...

946
01:23:29,437 --> 01:23:33,475
Woman on P.A.: DR. RENQUIST, PLEASE REPORT TO SECURITY IMMEDIATELY.

947
01:23:33,508 --> 01:23:40,415
DR. RENQUIST, PLEASE REPORT TO SECURITY IMMEDIATELY.

948
01:23:40,448 --> 01:23:44,819
DR. RENQUIST, PLEASE REPORT TO SECURITY IMMEDIATELY.

949
01:23:47,922 --> 01:23:50,458
I'LL DO IT!

950
01:23:50,492 --> 01:23:54,329
- Racquel: IAN, STOP. - I'LL FILL HIM FULL OF THIS SHIT.

951
01:23:54,362 --> 01:23:56,431
- NO, IAN. - GO AHEAD, IAN.

952
01:23:56,464 --> 01:23:59,601
GO AHEAD. IT'S ONLY A NORMAL SALINE SOLUTION.

953
01:23:59,634 --> 01:24:02,137
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

954
01:24:02,170 --> 01:24:04,272
THAT'S ALL IT EVER WAS.

955
01:24:04,305 --> 01:24:05,874
EVERYTHING YOU'VE BEEN THROUGH, EVERYTHING,

956
01:24:05,907 --> 01:24:07,542
WAS INSIDE YOU. THERE WERE NO DRUGS.

957
01:24:07,575 --> 01:24:11,379
- YOU'RE LYIN'. - IT WAS ALWAYS YOU, IAN.

958
01:24:16,384 --> 01:24:20,522
CALL THE POLICE. HE'S GONE OFF TO KILL HIS LAWYER.

959
01:24:29,864 --> 01:24:32,233
JOE, WHAT IS IT?

960
01:24:32,267 --> 01:24:35,270
WE HAVE TO TALK. IT'S ABOUT IAN.

961
01:24:42,944 --> 01:24:45,613
WHAT'S SO IMPORTANT, IT COULDN'T WAIT TILL MORNING?

962
01:24:45,647 --> 01:24:49,751
RELAX. WHY DON'T YOU GO FIX US A COUPLE OF DRINKS?

963
01:24:52,587 --> 01:24:56,591
JOE, I REALLY DON'T THINK THAT'S APPROPRIATE.

964
01:24:56,624 --> 01:25:00,628
YOU REALLY THINK I ENJOY DRIVIN' ACROSS TOWN THIS TIME OF NIGHT?

965
01:25:00,662 --> 01:25:03,798
I'M JUST TRYIN' TO HELP HERE.

966
01:25:03,832 --> 01:25:05,500
SORRY.

967
01:25:05,533 --> 01:25:08,603
ALL THIS STUFF WITH IAN IS MOVING SO FAST.

968
01:25:08,636 --> 01:25:11,639
WELL, ONCE THE PAPERS ARE SIGNED,

969
01:25:11,673 --> 01:25:13,608
IT'LL BE OVER.

970
01:25:13,641 --> 01:25:15,243
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

971
01:25:15,276 --> 01:25:16,911
I WAS THINKING.

972
01:25:16,945 --> 01:25:20,548
THERE'S GOOD AND BAD IN ALL THINGS.

973
01:25:20,582 --> 01:25:22,984
ALL PEOPLE.

974
01:25:23,017 --> 01:25:24,953
YOU CAN KNOW A GUY HIS ENTIRE LIFE,

975
01:25:24,986 --> 01:25:26,888
AND NEVER REALLY GET TO KNOW HIM.

976
01:25:26,921 --> 01:25:29,290
HIS DARK SIDE.

977
01:25:29,324 --> 01:25:31,826
ANYBODY'S CAPABLE OF ANYTHING.

978
01:25:35,997 --> 01:25:37,932
JOE, DON'T.

979
01:25:37,966 --> 01:25:40,368
I CAN'T GET OVER IT.

980
01:25:40,401 --> 01:25:43,838
HOW MUCH YOU LOOK LIKE WENDY.

981
01:25:46,708 --> 01:25:48,743
YOU HAVE THE SAME EYES.

982
01:25:48,776 --> 01:25:51,546
SAME MOUTH.

983
01:25:51,579 --> 01:25:53,915
JOE, STOP IT. YOU'RE SCARING ME.

984
01:25:58,653 --> 01:26:01,456
YOU DON'T HAVE ANYTHING TO WORRY ABOUT.

985
01:26:01,489 --> 01:26:03,625
WE CAN DO WHATEVER WE WANT.

986
01:26:03,658 --> 01:26:06,294
IAN'S OUT OF OUR LIVES FOREVER.

987
01:26:06,327 --> 01:26:07,695
- NO. - NOT SO FAST.

988
01:26:31,753 --> 01:26:33,721
- NO! - JOE, NO!

989
01:26:33,755 --> 01:26:37,692
GET OFF!

990
01:26:37,725 --> 01:26:40,261
NO. PLEASE, NO.

991
01:26:59,881 --> 01:27:03,418
OH, GOD, YOU'RE SO BEAUTIFUL.

992
01:27:03,451 --> 01:27:05,920
YOU'RE SO GODDAMN BEAUTIFUL.

993
01:27:12,694 --> 01:27:15,496
I ASK MYSELF,

994
01:27:15,530 --> 01:27:18,967
WHY ARE THE GIRLS ALWAYS FALLING FOR THE DOCTORS?

995
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:21,736
WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH THE LAWYERS?

996
01:27:24,606 --> 01:27:27,375
- JUST GIVE IT A FUCKING CHANCE. - ( neck snaps )

997
01:27:38,686 --> 01:27:39,821
GET OFF OF HER!

998
01:27:46,961 --> 01:27:48,029
YOU KILLED HER.

999
01:27:50,498 --> 01:27:52,867
SHE TRUSTED YOU.

1000
01:27:55,703 --> 01:27:57,505
CAN'T KEEP A GOOD MAN DOWN, HUH?

1001
01:27:59,140 --> 01:28:01,542
YOU NEVER COULD MEET DEFEAT.

1002
01:28:01,576 --> 01:28:03,144
NO WONDER YOU ALWAYS LIKED ME BEST.

1003
01:28:03,177 --> 01:28:04,846
AS A MATTER OF FACT, SO DID TERESA.

1004
01:28:06,714 --> 01:28:10,618
YOU ALWAYS HAD SUCH GOOD TASTE.

1005
01:28:10,652 --> 01:28:12,720
- YOU KILLED WENDY. - YEAH.

1006
01:28:12,754 --> 01:28:15,690
- TERESA TRIED TO TELL ME. - WHAT CAN I SAY?

1007
01:28:15,723 --> 01:28:17,825
LUNATIC ESCAPES FROM MENTAL INSTITUTION.

1008
01:28:17,859 --> 01:28:19,527
YOU COULDN'T HAVE BEEN MORE ACCOMMODATING.

1009
01:28:21,996 --> 01:28:25,433
COME ON, FRAT BOY, COME ON. BATTER UP!

1010
01:29:03,905 --> 01:29:07,642
Renquist: MR. LAZARRE IS A VERY SPECIAL CASE.

1011
01:29:07,675 --> 01:29:10,812
HE WAS QUITE TROUBLED ABOUT SOMETHING THAT HAPPENED

1012
01:29:10,845 --> 01:29:12,714
TO HIM IN HIS PAST.

1013
01:29:12,747 --> 01:29:15,616
SOMETHING SO DISTURBING THAT IT CAUSED

1014
01:29:15,650 --> 01:29:19,520
YEARS OF ABUSE, YEARS OF DENIAL AND TORMENT.

1015
01:29:19,554 --> 01:29:22,590
ROBBED OF AN ANCHOR, A LINK TO REALITY,

1016
01:29:22,623 --> 01:29:25,560
MR. LAZARRE COULD NO LONGER DISTINGUISH

1017
01:29:25,593 --> 01:29:27,762
BETWEEN WAKING AND SLEEP

1018
01:29:27,795 --> 01:29:31,532
OR NIGHTMARE AND SIMPLE FANTASY.

1019
01:29:31,566 --> 01:29:33,868
QUITE SIMPLY,

1020
01:29:33,901 --> 01:29:36,838
HE LOST HIS MIND.

1021
01:29:36,871 --> 01:29:40,575
THE MAN IS TOTALLY AND COMPLETELY DELUSIONAL.

1022
01:29:40,608 --> 01:29:40,608
I'M AFRAID...
