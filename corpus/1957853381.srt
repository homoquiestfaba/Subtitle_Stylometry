00:00:36,574 --> 00:00:40,411
When do the sins of a good man

1
00:00:40,446 --> 00:00:41,577
make him bad?

2
00:00:44,351 --> 00:00:47,253
I guess it all
comes down to choices.

3
00:00:50,819 --> 00:00:54,491
They say justice
doesn't come easy...

4
00:00:57,892 --> 00:00:59,826
in an unjust world.

5
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:06,800
Sometimes...

6
00:01:06,835 --> 00:01:10,606
If you're lucky...

7
00:01:10,641 --> 00:01:12,476
evil can be destroyed.

8
00:01:16,185 --> 00:01:17,646
But sometimes...

9
00:01:21,883 --> 00:01:24,554
Maybe it's better
to keep evil alive.

Ever heard of a GPS?

21
00:02:54,844 --> 00:02:56,481
This road to
the left is unlisted,

22
00:02:56,516 --> 00:02:59,418
but it looks like if
we take it down a few miles,

23
00:02:59,453 --> 00:03:01,552
it'll actually
take us back to the highway.

24
00:03:01,587 --> 00:03:04,753
So you're taking me
to slaughter?

25
00:03:04,788 --> 00:03:05,919
Nice.

26
00:03:05,954 --> 00:03:07,690
I mean, what choice do I have?

27
00:03:07,725 --> 00:03:10,561

we're going to lose a whole day.

37
00:04:52,599 --> 00:04:53,599
Erica.

Erica?

39
00:06:06,068 --> 00:06:07,474
We have to get out of here.

40
00:06:07,509 --> 00:06:08,552
There's fucking
zombies out there!

41
00:06:08,576 --> 00:06:09,806
Those aren't zombies.

42
00:06:09,841 --> 00:06:11,137
Ah!

43
00:06:38,166 --> 00:06:43,202
The breach, the chasm...

44
00:06:43,237 --> 00:06:46,876
Between you and nothingness.

45
00:06:46,911 --> 00:06:49,681
I can feel you when I breathe.

46
00:06:49,716 --> 00:06:51,617
I gasp, I choke.

47
00:06:53,918 --> 00:06:56,688
I can still smell the rain,
the fiery exhaust.

48
00:06:58,593 --> 00:06:59,889
You're lost.

49
00:06:59,924 --> 00:07:03,794
I'm beaten. Broken.

50
00:07:04,962 --> 00:07:08,766
And scarred, a lost limb.

51
00:07:08,801 --> 00:07:11,769
It will never come back.

52
00:07:11,804 --> 00:07:14,673
It will always feel attached...

53
00:08:05,352 --> 00:08:07,154
I have... I have a memory.

54
00:08:09,224 --> 00:08:10,729
It haunts me a little bit.

55
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:14,535
I was ten years old and...

56
00:08:17,067 --> 00:08:19,166
My mom, she was still alive
at that time.

57
00:08:22,611 --> 00:08:23,874
I think she was upstairs.

58
00:08:25,944 --> 00:08:29,880
But when I came home
and opened the door,

59
00:08:29,915 --> 00:08:34,016
a small red sparrow
flew through and...

60
00:09:00,341 --> 00:09:01,780
But it just...

61
00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:06,246
It just kept flying
into the window until it, um...

62
00:09:09,955 --> 00:09:11,185
Until it just broke its neck.

63
00:09:12,386 --> 00:09:15,794
You're not a sparrow, Sarah.

64
00:09:15,829 --> 00:09:17,994
You can see the open door.

65
00:09:22,902 --> 00:09:26,640

that you can heal is you.

00:09:38,819 --> 00:09:40,412
Wow. Would you look at that?

68
00:09:40,447 --> 00:09:42,249
Courtney's going
tomorrow night, too.

69
00:09:42,284 --> 00:09:44,328
Oh, Beth, can you imagine
what it's like to have a dad

70
00:09:44,352 --> 00:09:45,725
who lets you actually do things?

71
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,760
Crazy thought.

72
00:09:47,795 --> 00:09:49,223
Like, how could
you want to miss out

73
00:09:49,258 --> 00:09:51,357
on my world
famous potato skins anyway?

74
00:09:51,392 --> 00:09:53,161
- It's just one dinner.
- Oh, no, no, no, no.

75
00:09:53,196 --> 00:09:55,031
It's not just one dinner, honey.

76
00:09:55,066 --> 00:09:57,836
It's the traditional Bishop
family Christmas Eve dinner.

77
00:09:57,871 --> 00:09:59,167
Can we got the stuffy now?

78
00:09:59,202 --> 00:10:01,807
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Go grab it, honey.

79
00:10:01,842 --> 00:10:04,073
- Dad?
- Yes.

80
00:10:04,108 --> 00:10:07,747
Do you realize that
I'm the only senior with no car,

81
00:10:07,782 --> 00:10:11,443
no boyfriend,
and a 10:00 curfew?

82
00:10:11,478 --> 00:10:13,412
Sounds like you got
one smart dad.

83
00:10:13,447 --> 00:10:14,952
Ha ha ha ha.

84
00:10:14,987 --> 00:10:16,448
Dad, it's not funny.
I'm serious.

85
00:10:16,483 --> 00:10:17,757
Why can't I just go?

86
00:10:17,792 --> 00:10:18,835
What happened to our deal, huh?

87
00:10:18,859 --> 00:10:20,386
What deal?

88
00:10:20,421 --> 00:10:22,234
That you weren't going
to get all grown up on me

89
00:10:22,258 --> 00:10:24,995
without my permission.

90
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:26,194
Whatever, thank you.

91
00:10:28,363 --> 00:10:31,870
Hey. Wow. That's so cool, honey.
Little guy's going to love that.

92
00:10:31,905 --> 00:10:34,004
Let's pick out some cool
wrapping paper, too, huh?

93
00:10:34,039 --> 00:10:36,039
Can't we just give it
to them like this?

94
00:10:36,074 --> 00:10:39,174
A present is not a present
until it's wrapped.

95
00:10:39,209 --> 00:10:40,209
You can't just take it.

96
00:10:40,243 --> 00:10:41,946
It's over here.

97
00:10:41,981 --> 00:10:43,882
That's our tree. You can't just
take our tree.

98
00:10:43,917 --> 00:10:45,213
What's your problem, dude?

99
00:10:45,248 --> 00:10:48,315
Hey. What's going on, honey?

100
00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:50,768
I was just standing on my phone,
and that guy, he just dragged

101
00:10:50,792 --> 00:10:52,272
the tree away from me
like it was his.

102
00:10:55,863 --> 00:10:57,390
- Okay.
- Excuse me, sir.

103
00:10:57,425 --> 00:10:58,996
You made a mistake.
That's our tree.

104
00:11:02,001 --> 00:11:03,374
Hey, look,
I don't want any trouble.

105
00:11:03,398 --> 00:11:06,971
Hey, is your name on the tag,
or does it say

106
00:11:07,006 --> 00:11:09,141
I'm for sale for 50 bucks?

107
00:11:12,209 --> 00:11:13,747
Hey, pal, look.

108
00:11:13,782 --> 00:11:14,880
I'm not your pal.

109
00:11:28,258 --> 00:11:30,929

Daddy's tougher than the Hulk!

111
00:11:32,867 --> 00:11:34,966
Keep counting, you.

112
00:11:35,001 --> 00:11:36,979
You mean the same tough guy
who's wanted a motorcycle

113
00:11:37,003 --> 00:11:39,971
his entire life but wimps out
every time he goes to get one?

114
00:11:42,107 --> 00:11:47,110
What you call being a wimp,
I call being practical.

115
00:11:47,145 --> 00:11:50,146
Just like how we practically got
the Christmas tree we wanted.

116
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,986
You won't become a teenager,
right, Freckles?

117
00:11:55,021 --> 00:11:56,757
Absolutely not.

118
00:12:16,977 --> 00:12:18,273
- Hey, you.
- Hi.

119
00:12:18,308 --> 00:12:20,440
So, uh...

120
00:12:20,475 --> 00:12:22,145
Still upset about this morning?

121
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:24,884
Mmm... I mean, I just don't
understand, like,

122
00:12:24,919 --> 00:12:26,292
why do you do all those
push ups and stuff

123
00:12:26,316 --> 00:12:28,019
if you can't even
defend your daughters?

124
00:12:28,054 --> 00:12:29,394
So you think I should
have just punched the guy out

125
00:12:29,418 --> 00:12:31,088
in the middle of
the Christmas tree lot?

126
00:12:31,123 --> 00:12:33,090
Oh, my God.
That is not what I just said.

127
00:12:33,125 --> 00:12:34,586
I'm just saying, Dad.

128
00:12:34,621 --> 00:12:37,391
You watch<i> Die Hard,</i>
what, every day?

129
00:12:37,426 --> 00:12:41,131

whatever his name is, would do?

130
00:12:41,166 --> 00:12:43,529
'80s action heroes,
they solve problems

131
00:12:43,564 --> 00:12:46,136

You know, real life
doesn't work that way.

133
00:12:47,942 --> 00:12:49,568
Got it. Noted.

134
00:12:49,603 --> 00:12:53,077
I'm thinking I may actually
address it in my sermon tonight.

135
00:12:53,112 --> 00:12:54,881
Dad, no.
Daddy, please.

136
00:12:54,916 --> 00:12:56,421
No, you can not talk
about me in your sermon.

137
00:12:56,445 --> 00:12:59,248
I forgot to tell you,
you can go to the party tonight.

138
00:12:59,283 --> 00:13:01,415

139
00:13:01,450 --> 00:13:02,548

00:13:04,552 --> 00:13:06,387
Okay? Yeah, 11:30.
No problem.

142
00:13:06,422 --> 00:13:08,136
All right? You're not back
by the time Santa shows up,

143
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:09,390
no presents for you.

144
00:13:09,425 --> 00:13:11,425
Okay.

145
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:12,624

- Yes.

146
00:13:12,659 --> 00:13:14,296

to next week's service
with blue hair, all right?

Before we wrap up this service,

157
00:13:51,038 --> 00:13:53,302
I'd like to share
a personal story

158
00:13:53,337 --> 00:13:55,073
that happened yesterday.

159
00:13:55,108 --> 00:13:58,208
My girls and I, we were out
shopping for our tree.

160
00:14:00,641 --> 00:14:03,246
Picking up a few presents.

161
00:14:03,281 --> 00:14:06,480
Nothing like last minute, right?

162
00:14:06,515 --> 00:14:11,056
I leave Sarah
in line to pay for the tree

163
00:14:11,091 --> 00:14:13,652
while Rebecca and I go pick up
a few more gifts.

164
00:14:13,687 --> 00:14:17,293
We look back

165
00:14:17,328 --> 00:14:20,395
and we see a man

166
00:14:20,430 --> 00:14:23,266
has claimed our tree as his.

167
00:14:25,633 --> 00:14:27,567
I tried talking to him.

168
00:14:27,602 --> 00:14:29,140
Hey, pal, look...

169
00:14:29,175 --> 00:14:30,273
I'm not your pal.

170
00:14:37,249 --> 00:14:39,150
Sarah's eyes say to me,

171
00:14:39,185 --> 00:14:43,484
"Dad, aren't you
going to do something?"

172
00:14:45,521 --> 00:14:47,719
So I did.

173
00:14:47,754 --> 00:14:49,193
I did do something.

174
00:14:53,661 --> 00:14:55,001
Merry Christmas.

175
00:15:00,767 --> 00:15:02,239
I know, I know.

176
00:15:02,274 --> 00:15:05,011
Not exactly a one liner
worthy of Rambo

177
00:15:05,046 --> 00:15:07,706
or the Terminator.

178
00:15:09,314 --> 00:15:10,654
Should I have knocked
him on his butt

179
00:15:10,678 --> 00:15:12,243
in the middle
of the Christmas tree lot?

180
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:17,617
Luke 18, verse three.

181
00:15:17,652 --> 00:15:21,489
Here is a parable about a woman

182
00:15:21,524 --> 00:15:24,591
seeking vengeance
for a wrongdoer

183
00:15:24,626 --> 00:15:29,332
who victimized her
and then escaped justice.

184
00:15:29,367 --> 00:15:33,039
"Avenge me of mine adversary."

185
00:15:33,074 --> 00:15:36,504
Day and night,
she begs this judge.

186
00:15:36,539 --> 00:15:38,110
But Jesus tells us...

187
00:15:39,575 --> 00:15:43,016
"When a sinner goes unpunished,

188
00:15:43,051 --> 00:15:47,020
"he is only free from man's law."

189
00:15:51,455 --> 00:15:53,719
"When man's law fails..."

190
00:15:55,690 --> 00:15:57,294
"God's law prevails."

191
00:16:02,367 --> 00:16:06,204
So I leave
you all with one last word

192
00:16:06,239 --> 00:16:10,373
to any of us seeking
justice in a world

193
00:16:10,408 --> 00:16:11,440
where it's lacking.

194
00:16:14,181 --> 00:16:17,578
Trust not in the sword,

195
00:16:17,613 --> 00:16:19,745
but in the grace of our Lord.

196
00:16:41,505 --> 00:16:42,669
Anybody here?

197
00:16:48,677 --> 00:16:49,677
Yo.

198
00:16:53,319 --> 00:16:54,384
You here?

199
00:16:56,652 --> 00:16:57,652
Hello?

200
00:17:06,167 --> 00:17:07,397
Hello?

201
00:17:12,569 --> 00:17:14,107
Yo, hey, man.

202
00:17:18,212 --> 00:17:19,541
Yo. You in there?

203
00:17:19,576 --> 00:17:20,740
Yo!

204
00:17:36,758 --> 00:17:37,823
Don't touch my car.

205
00:17:40,564 --> 00:17:43,301
Fuck. Trying to give me
a heart attack?

206
00:17:47,439 --> 00:17:49,505
You want to fucking go
right now, motherfucker?

207
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:51,111
Let's go.

208
00:17:55,282 --> 00:17:57,546
I was just fucking
with you, man.

209
00:17:57,581 --> 00:17:59,713
I'm glad we're doing this.

210
00:17:59,748 --> 00:18:01,319
But, hey, I get it.

211
00:18:01,354 --> 00:18:03,156
You're a,
"You can fuck my old lady,

212
00:18:03,191 --> 00:18:05,653
"but stay the fuck away
from my wheels" kind of guy.

213
00:18:05,688 --> 00:18:07,688
I can dig it.

214
00:18:07,723 --> 00:18:09,789
Sorry I'm late.

215
00:18:09,824 --> 00:18:12,198
Break number seven.
You believe that?

216
00:18:13,927 --> 00:18:16,301
Boom, ah!

217
00:18:16,336 --> 00:18:20,437
The bitch is I keep re-breaking
the fucker over and over.

218
00:18:25,411 --> 00:18:26,411
Yeah.

219
00:18:29,382 --> 00:18:32,944
All right, well, let's do this.

220
00:18:32,979 --> 00:18:36,519
Hey, man, if you had told me
that one day

221
00:18:36,554 --> 00:18:39,687
our clubs would have been
doing business together,

222
00:18:39,722 --> 00:18:41,491
I'd have never fucking
believed it.

223
00:18:46,267 --> 00:18:48,300
Look at this shit, man.

224
00:18:48,335 --> 00:18:51,864
White as Snow White's
ass cheeks.

225
00:18:51,899 --> 00:18:52,931
Mmm.

226
00:18:55,408 --> 00:18:59,773
Oh, hey,
you're Vic's brother, right?

227
00:18:59,808 --> 00:19:01,808
Oh, yeah, man.

228
00:19:01,843 --> 00:19:03,678
I've heard stories, man.

229
00:19:03,713 --> 00:19:05,779
You are one crazy fuck!

230
00:19:07,717 --> 00:19:09,189
Whew!

231
00:19:13,657 --> 00:19:15,426
You brought money, right?

232
00:19:25,834 --> 00:19:26,834
Here you go, kid.

233
00:19:39,584 --> 00:19:41,749
Hey, if I didn't have
a busted ham hock,

234
00:19:41,784 --> 00:19:43,685
I'd be happy to reach
in there, chief.

235
00:19:49,429 --> 00:19:50,593
You want to do me a favor and

236
00:19:50,628 --> 00:19:52,397
hand me
the fucking loot, sunshine?

237
00:19:54,434 --> 00:19:57,369
Oh, I get it.

238
00:19:57,404 --> 00:20:00,636
You just want a good
look at my ass, huh?

239
00:20:00,671 --> 00:20:01,637
All right, man.

240
00:20:01,672 --> 00:20:03,441
Whatever turns your wheels.

241
00:20:07,513 --> 00:20:11,680
Oh! Ah!

242
00:20:13,849 --> 00:20:15,420
No! Ah!

243
00:20:17,952 --> 00:20:19,919
Ah!

244
00:20:23,892 --> 00:20:27,894
Oh!

245
00:20:35,475 --> 00:20:38,707
Get off of me,
fucking piece of shit!

246
00:20:38,742 --> 00:20:40,808
Get off me!

247
00:20:57,629 --> 00:20:59,596
And it really
is special, though.

248
00:20:59,631 --> 00:21:02,863
When you guys come out,
you're the ones who add to it.

249
00:21:02,898 --> 00:21:04,502
Oh, hey, hon.

250
00:21:04,537 --> 00:21:07,439
Excuse me, guys. One minute.
Hi.

251
00:21:07,474 --> 00:21:09,969
Well, thanks for not
bringing me up today.

252
00:21:10,004 --> 00:21:12,345
Hey, you need to put gas
in the car, okay?

253
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:14,974
Fill it up all the way.

254
00:21:17,649 --> 00:21:19,946
Hey. 11:30.

255
00:21:19,981 --> 00:21:21,013
11:30.

256
00:22:13,936 --> 00:22:16,508
Ah, fuck!

257
00:22:16,543 --> 00:22:18,873
Fucking bitch!

258
00:22:19,975 --> 00:22:20,975
Fuck.

259
00:22:34,990 --> 00:22:36,660
Come on, come on, Dad.
Come on.

260
00:22:36,695 --> 00:22:37,695
Oh, sorry.

261
00:22:42,569 --> 00:22:43,667
- Hey.
- Dad.

262
00:22:43,702 --> 00:22:44,702
Miss me already, huh?

263
00:22:44,736 --> 00:22:46,604
<i>No, Dad.</i>

264
00:22:46,639 --> 00:22:48,452
<i>I stopped at the gas station
before the party, and, um.</i>

265
00:22:48,476 --> 00:22:50,014
And there was this guy there
and I had to pepper spray him.

266
00:22:50,038 --> 00:22:51,884
- What? You had to...
- And he's following me now.

267
00:22:51,908 --> 00:22:53,479
Someone's following you?

268
00:22:53,514 --> 00:22:54,994
Yes, yes,
he's following me right now.

269
00:23:01,016 --> 00:23:02,656
Dad, I'm really scared,
he's following me.

270
00:23:05,559 --> 00:23:06,657
Come on.

271
00:23:06,692 --> 00:23:08,087
I think he's going to hurt me.

272
00:23:08,122 --> 00:23:09,165
Where are you?
Are you near the party?

273
00:23:09,189 --> 00:23:11,057
Where are you?

274
00:23:11,092 --> 00:23:13,466
I'm on Bridge Pardley road.
Please, I need you to help me.

275
00:23:13,501 --> 00:23:15,468
- Sarah!
- Dad!

276
00:23:36,282 --> 00:23:37,754
Get away from me!

277
00:23:37,789 --> 00:23:38,755
Don't...

278
00:23:38,790 --> 00:23:39,756
Ah!

279
00:23:39,791 --> 00:23:40,791
Get off!

280
00:23:42,695 --> 00:23:44,464
Help!

281
00:23:46,226 --> 00:23:47,962
Help me!

282
00:23:47,997 --> 00:23:50,096
Look at me. Look at me!

283
00:23:50,131 --> 00:23:52,032
Look at me!

284
00:23:52,067 --> 00:23:54,738
I'm not going to tell anyone!

285
00:23:56,742 --> 00:23:58,038
Hey.

286
00:23:58,073 --> 00:24:00,238
Hey! Hey!

287
00:24:00,273 --> 00:24:02,680
Help! Please, please.

288
00:24:02,715 --> 00:24:03,681
Please.

289
00:24:03,716 --> 00:24:05,947
No!

290
00:24:07,247 --> 00:24:10,655
Daddy! Help me!

291
00:24:10,690 --> 00:24:13,185
Somebody help! No!

292
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:15,187
Help me!

293
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:29,773
♪

294
00:24:51,929 --> 00:24:54,292
My daughter called me
said she was here.

295
00:24:54,327 --> 00:24:55,898
- What's your name?
- John Bishop.

296
00:24:58,804 --> 00:25:01,332
Mr. Bishop? Mr. Bishop!

297
00:25:01,367 --> 00:25:03,642
- No! No!
- Hold him.

298
00:25:03,677 --> 00:25:06,876
No! No!

299
00:25:23,928 --> 00:25:26,324
Ripped from life's embrace.

300
00:25:29,098 --> 00:25:33,199
The space in my soul, stolen.

301
00:25:39,372 --> 00:25:43,781
Spiritual death is nothing else
than alienation of the soul

302
00:25:43,816 --> 00:25:45,079
from God.

303
00:25:47,248 --> 00:25:49,721
Lead me not into temptation...

304
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:56,222
But deliver me from evil.

305
00:26:14,209 --> 00:26:15,648
How's your brother in law doing?

306
00:26:17,850 --> 00:26:19,718
His knees must be raw.

307
00:26:19,753 --> 00:26:21,993
He's been upstairs praying next
to Sarah's bed all night.

308
00:26:24,450 --> 00:26:26,824
The whole town is here for him.

309
00:26:26,859 --> 00:26:27,990
And Rebecca.

310
00:26:36,033 --> 00:26:37,033
Ma'am.

311
00:26:42,776 --> 00:26:43,776
Johnny.

312
00:26:44,910 --> 00:26:45,910
What?

313
00:26:48,815 --> 00:26:49,815
Mr. Bishop.

314
00:26:52,918 --> 00:26:54,984
Detective Sawyer.

315
00:26:55,019 --> 00:26:57,723
You can call me Jed.

316
00:26:57,758 --> 00:26:59,692
I'm sorry
about your loss, Pastor.

317
00:26:59,727 --> 00:27:03,124
I won't bother you
with any more words of comfort.

318
00:27:03,159 --> 00:27:04,159
Excuse me?

319
00:27:05,964 --> 00:27:07,865
Well, I'm acquainted
with this sort of hurt,

320
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:09,262
you could say.

321
00:27:09,297 --> 00:27:12,001
I know the futility.

322
00:27:12,036 --> 00:27:13,431
I'd prefer to get down
to business,

323
00:27:13,466 --> 00:27:14,773
if that's okay with you.

324
00:27:16,502 --> 00:27:19,173
Let's have a seat.

325
00:27:19,208 --> 00:27:21,912
The report I got here
says when you spoke

326
00:27:21,947 --> 00:27:25,311
with your daughter,
she said she was being chased.

327
00:27:25,346 --> 00:27:28,215
She say anything else?

328
00:27:28,250 --> 00:27:31,152
Old's black muscle car.

329
00:27:31,187 --> 00:27:32,725
That makes sense to you?

330
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:35,354
No. Tell me
you have a lead or something.

331
00:27:45,432 --> 00:27:48,939
Mr. Bishop, I don't think this
was a case of road rage.

332
00:27:51,141 --> 00:27:53,878
Sarah was found with her hands
zip-tied to the steering wheel.

333
00:28:13,867 --> 00:28:15,801
I'm sorry.

334
00:28:15,836 --> 00:28:17,099
Who would do this?

335
00:28:20,236 --> 00:28:21,499
She was just a kid.

336
00:28:26,275 --> 00:28:28,011
She was just a kid.

337
00:28:35,482 --> 00:28:38,186
I promise you, I will find
who's responsible for this.

338
00:28:38,221 --> 00:28:39,451
I'm going to look, too.

339
00:28:39,486 --> 00:28:41,959
That's not a good idea,
Mr. Bishop.

340
00:28:41,994 --> 00:28:43,895
It's probably best
if you go, Detective.

341
00:29:00,309 --> 00:29:01,946
I'll be in touch.

342
00:29:06,084 --> 00:29:07,149
Ma'am.

343
00:29:45,222 --> 00:29:48,058
Up making her way
around the bar, Snowflake.

344
00:29:53,395 --> 00:29:56,363
Remember, don't forget
tip our beautiful bartenders.

345
00:30:10,148 --> 00:30:11,114
What's up?

346
00:30:11,149 --> 00:30:13,479
Hey, job done and some.

347
00:30:13,514 --> 00:30:15,448
Let me talk to Vic.

348
00:30:21,555 --> 00:30:24,226
Hey, Vic, it's Ram.

349
00:30:24,261 --> 00:30:25,557
You want to take this, trust me.

350
00:30:28,936 --> 00:30:31,596
<i>I got the crystal and the cash.</i>

351
00:30:31,631 --> 00:30:35,567
Now they know exactly
who's running this zip code.

352
00:30:35,602 --> 00:30:37,272
<i>Meet you at the bar tomorrow.</i>

353
00:30:37,307 --> 00:30:38,504
<i>Noon.</i>

354
00:30:41,113 --> 00:30:42,343
Woo!

355
00:30:50,089 --> 00:30:53,024
You should come over. I'll grab
a couple cases of beer.

356
00:30:53,059 --> 00:30:54,421
James left
that bottle of tequila

357
00:30:54,456 --> 00:30:56,357
from last weekend,
so we can definitely

358
00:30:56,392 --> 00:30:58,293
have a party, dude,
just let me know.

359
00:30:58,328 --> 00:30:59,943
Yeah, dude, ping pong's
going to be sweet.

360
00:30:59,967 --> 00:31:02,033
It'll be fucking awesome.
Can't wait.

361
00:31:02,068 --> 00:31:03,628
Yeah, for sure, man.
Hey, hold on a sec.

362
00:31:03,663 --> 00:31:05,333
Pump number?

363
00:31:05,368 --> 00:31:08,567
I'm talking to all the gas
stations near downtown.

364
00:31:08,602 --> 00:31:10,536
Two nights ago.

365
00:31:10,571 --> 00:31:13,143
She was in a gray Mercedes
between eight and 9 p.m.

366
00:31:13,178 --> 00:31:14,144
You remember her?

367
00:31:14,179 --> 00:31:15,981
Look, man, let me call you back.

368
00:31:16,016 --> 00:31:17,213
I don't fucking know, man.

369
00:31:17,248 --> 00:31:18,214
She looks cute, though.

370
00:31:18,249 --> 00:31:20,084
Who looks cute?

371
00:31:20,119 --> 00:31:21,998
Can I see you're surveillance
footage from two days ago?

372
00:31:22,022 --> 00:31:24,649
- Easy there S.V.U.
- Hey, you got a warrant?

373
00:31:24,684 --> 00:31:26,057
You got a warrant?

374
00:31:30,492 --> 00:31:31,964
I'm going to need to see
those tapes.

375
00:31:34,067 --> 00:31:35,132
Get the tapes.

376
00:31:35,167 --> 00:31:37,629
♪

377
00:32:56,281 --> 00:32:57,643
What's the trouble, Officer?

378
00:32:59,746 --> 00:33:01,317
Ah!

379
00:33:21,669 --> 00:33:23,339
- Hey, Jimmy!
- What's up, boys?

380
00:33:23,374 --> 00:33:24,516
Hey, man, you seen
Vic's brother?

381
00:33:24,540 --> 00:33:26,507
Can't say I have, boss.

382
00:33:26,542 --> 00:33:27,772
I fucking told him, man.

383
00:33:27,807 --> 00:33:29,609
Otto's going to be
fucking pissed.

384
00:33:29,644 --> 00:33:32,381
Unfucking believable.

385
00:33:33,516 --> 00:33:34,581
He's just gone.

386
00:33:36,651 --> 00:33:37,683
No one's seen him.

387
00:33:40,292 --> 00:33:41,621
No. It's all gone dark.

388
00:33:41,656 --> 00:33:44,756
You're telling me...

389
00:33:44,791 --> 00:33:47,264
You can't find...

390
00:33:47,299 --> 00:33:49,266
your own brother?

391
00:33:57,276 --> 00:33:59,243
Look harder.

392
00:34:11,389 --> 00:34:12,817
You seen my keys?

393
00:34:12,852 --> 00:34:15,358
Johnny, you shouldn't
be driving right now.

394
00:34:15,393 --> 00:34:16,557
I had them.

395
00:34:19,463 --> 00:34:20,858
You had them, I think.

396
00:34:20,893 --> 00:34:22,695
Johnny, this isn't you.
You're scaring me.

397
00:34:22,730 --> 00:34:25,434
Just... Just let the police do
their job, okay? You need sleep.

398
00:34:25,469 --> 00:34:26,798
What I need

399
00:34:26,833 --> 00:34:29,570
is to find out
who did this to my daughter.

400
00:34:31,574 --> 00:34:34,278
Daddy, are you okay?

401
00:34:40,187 --> 00:34:41,384
Baby...

402
00:34:44,290 --> 00:34:45,784
Baby, what are you doing up?

403
00:34:45,819 --> 00:34:47,225
I had a nightmare.

404
00:34:49,262 --> 00:34:52,494
Remember what we talked
about, honey.

405
00:34:52,529 --> 00:34:53,792
When you're in nightmares,

406
00:34:53,827 --> 00:34:55,277
you have to change
the channel, right?

407
00:34:55,301 --> 00:34:57,598
I already tried.

408
00:34:57,633 --> 00:34:58,698
Will you lay next to me?

409
00:35:00,933 --> 00:35:01,933
When I get back.

410
00:35:08,809 --> 00:35:10,281
Where are you going?

411
00:35:10,316 --> 00:35:12,250

to worry about that.

Pick it up.

You don't give in.

433
00:37:24,417 --> 00:37:25,515
You don't give up.

434
00:37:38,761 --> 00:37:40,497
Where's Vic?

435
00:37:40,532 --> 00:37:41,828
He's still looking.

436
00:37:41,863 --> 00:37:43,830
He should be sitting
where you are right now.

437
00:37:50,806 --> 00:37:53,543
After a decade of bloodshed
with the Fallen Angels,

438
00:37:53,578 --> 00:37:56,447
I arranged the first truce
in our club's history.

439
00:37:56,482 --> 00:37:58,350
You want to know why?

440
00:37:58,385 --> 00:37:59,879
To keep the noise down.

441
00:38:01,784 --> 00:38:03,949
I asked you to handle
a very simple meet.

442
00:38:06,954 --> 00:38:09,757
Sample the crystal.

443
00:38:09,792 --> 00:38:13,024
Start a working relationship.

444
00:38:13,059 --> 00:38:17,699
And Vic sends in his brother.

445
00:38:17,734 --> 00:38:20,603
- Otto...
- Shh.

446
00:38:22,838 --> 00:38:26,037
I just got off the phone
with their president.

447
00:38:26,072 --> 00:38:29,711
He says one of their guys, Arlo,
magically disappeared.

448
00:38:32,947 --> 00:38:36,421
They went to the meet
to look for him.

449
00:38:36,456 --> 00:38:37,587
You know what they found?

450
00:38:43,661 --> 00:38:46,728
His wheelchair, broken in half.

451
00:38:51,097 --> 00:38:52,536
All his teeth in a pile.

452
00:38:54,936 --> 00:38:57,112
You know, what else seems to
have just magically disappeared?

453
00:38:57,136 --> 00:39:01,644
My money, my crystal, and
Vic's fucking brother.

454
00:39:01,679 --> 00:39:03,547
His fucking brother.

455
00:39:10,050 --> 00:39:12,457
Move your feet.

456
00:39:18,223 --> 00:39:20,630
You ready to fix this?

457
00:39:20,665 --> 00:39:21,972
The President just said that
they're putting trackers

458
00:39:21,996 --> 00:39:25,162
in all the outgoing packages.

459
00:39:25,197 --> 00:39:27,637
They're forming a posse,

460
00:39:27,672 --> 00:39:31,069
calling in all the chapters
from upstate tonight.

461
00:39:31,104 --> 00:39:33,709
They're on the way to pick up
the tracker from the cathouse.

462
00:39:33,744 --> 00:39:36,811
I want you to intercept
and pick it up before they do.

463
00:39:36,846 --> 00:39:38,153
They're always fucked up
on their own shit,

464
00:39:38,177 --> 00:39:39,715
so you won't
find much resistance.

465
00:39:39,750 --> 00:39:40,881
How about the truce?

466
00:39:40,916 --> 00:39:42,949
The truce got fucked

467
00:39:42,984 --> 00:39:45,182
the moment Vic sent his brother
to the meet.

468
00:39:45,217 --> 00:39:47,822
We need to regain
control of the situation, boys.

469
00:39:47,857 --> 00:39:49,791
That means
we need to get the money,

470
00:39:49,826 --> 00:39:53,058
the crystal and Ram Kady
before they do.

471
00:39:53,093 --> 00:39:54,961
No more playing nice.

472
00:39:54,996 --> 00:39:57,161
War is back on.
Get out of here.

473
00:40:01,805 --> 00:40:03,904
And boys?

474
00:40:03,939 --> 00:40:05,202
Tell Vic...

475
00:40:11,210 --> 00:40:13,012
I want him to personally

476
00:40:13,047 --> 00:40:15,113
bring his brother to me...

477
00:40:17,722 --> 00:40:18,886
alive.

478
00:40:24,762 --> 00:40:26,498
Hey!

479
00:40:29,129 --> 00:40:31,063
Where am I?

480
00:40:35,201 --> 00:40:36,201
Where am I?

481
00:40:46,850 --> 00:40:47,981
Hey!

482
00:40:55,628 --> 00:40:58,563
<i>Hello?</i>

483
00:40:58,598 --> 00:40:59,762
Where am I?

484
00:41:02,294 --> 00:41:05,097
[distorted voice
<i>Your name is now number 21.</i>

485
00:41:05,132 --> 00:41:06,296
Where am I?

486
00:41:11,237 --> 00:41:14,073
<i>When you want to speak,
say your name, then speak.</i>

487
00:41:14,108 --> 00:41:16,108
You're crazy.

488
00:41:16,143 --> 00:41:17,241
<i>Then say your name again.</i>

489
00:41:17,276 --> 00:41:18,880
Fuck you!

490
00:41:25,218 --> 00:41:28,824
<i>For example, you would say,</i>

491
00:41:28,859 --> 00:41:33,631
<i>"Number 21, fuck you,
number 21."</i>

492
00:41:35,063 --> 00:41:37,261
Turn on the fucking lights

493
00:41:37,296 --> 00:41:40,000
so I can rip your
fucking throat out!

494
00:41:46,041 --> 00:41:50,241
<i>Say your name, then speak,</i>

495
00:41:50,276 --> 00:41:52,683
<i>then say your name again.</i>

496
00:41:56,656 --> 00:42:00,955
Number 21...

497
00:42:00,990 --> 00:42:04,354
turn on the fucking lights.

498
00:42:04,389 --> 00:42:05,762
Number 21.

499
00:42:09,999 --> 00:42:12,637
<i>There we go.</i>

500
00:42:14,366 --> 00:42:17,136
I'm gonna fucking kill you.

501
00:42:21,945 --> 00:42:24,616
You going to be okay
at Aunt Jody's?

502
00:42:30,382 --> 00:42:31,920
I've got a present for you.

503
00:42:36,025 --> 00:42:41,292
I...
I meant to give it to you...

504
00:42:41,327 --> 00:42:42,363
Christmas.

505
00:42:45,430 --> 00:42:46,902
It's beautiful.

506
00:42:49,676 --> 00:42:50,708
I can't accept this.

507
00:42:53,009 --> 00:42:55,108
Why not, honey?

508
00:42:55,143 --> 00:42:57,946
A present's not a
present until it's wrapped.

509
00:43:02,348 --> 00:43:04,282
That's right.

510
00:43:04,317 --> 00:43:06,955
Well, then I promise you,

511
00:43:06,990 --> 00:43:10,255
I will have it wrapped
by the time you get back, okay?

512
00:43:20,971 --> 00:43:22,773
Thank you. Okay?

513
00:43:22,808 --> 00:43:23,808
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay.

514
00:43:27,208 --> 00:43:28,208
Wait!

515
00:43:35,755 --> 00:43:38,316
Just needed one more squeeze.

516
00:43:38,351 --> 00:43:41,121
Hmm. Me too, honey.

517
00:43:41,156 --> 00:43:42,156
Me too.

518
00:43:45,930 --> 00:43:48,733

"you will be able
to defend yourself."

873
01:28:27,972 --> 01:28:30,071
"And when the battle is over,"

874
01:28:33,417 --> 01:28:35,043
"you will be standing firm."

875
01:28:35,078 --> 01:28:37,650

01:28:50,027 --> 01:28:51,598

- What are you doing?

882
01:28:51,633 --> 01:28:53,831

01:29:26,129 --> 01:29:28,767
- Hey, bud.
- Yeah.

903
01:29:28,802 --> 01:29:30,164
My daughter was in here.

904
01:29:30,199 --> 01:29:31,935
Okay, she was in here,
and now she's not.

905
01:29:31,970 --> 01:29:33,750
Look, my little guy is doing
travel league this summer.

906
01:29:33,774 --> 01:29:34,938
- All right?
- Yeah.

907
01:29:34,973 --> 01:29:36,511
We got to get our licks
in when we can.

908
01:29:36,546 --> 01:29:38,073
It's my lunch hour.
I got stuff to do.

909
01:29:38,108 --> 01:29:39,888
- I just paid for 30 minutes.
- And that's all good.

910
01:29:39,912 --> 01:29:43,551
But, you know, don't...
Don't kick my daughter out, huh?

911
01:29:43,586 --> 01:29:45,179
What?

912
01:29:45,214 --> 01:29:47,819
I said it's all good,
but don't kick my daughter out.

913
01:29:47,854 --> 01:29:49,458
Who do you think
you're talking to?

914
01:29:49,493 --> 01:29:50,591
Hmm?

915
01:29:58,601 --> 01:30:01,195
Get out of the cage now.

916
01:30:01,230 --> 01:30:03,164
You know, I got a better idea.

917
01:30:08,270 --> 01:30:12,107
Why don't you tell your little
daughter pick up the balls?

918
01:30:12,142 --> 01:30:14,681
You know that, Jacob.

919
01:30:14,716 --> 01:30:16,276
Little chickadee
doesn't have any balls.

920
01:30:22,922 --> 01:30:25,087
Honey.

921
01:30:25,122 --> 01:30:26,990
Daddy's sorry about this. Okay?
