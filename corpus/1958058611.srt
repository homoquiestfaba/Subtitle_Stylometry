THEME SONG: Ooh.

2
00:00:21,355 --> 00:00:23,824
Just too hot.

3
00:00:23,824 --> 00:00:25,826
Yeah!

4
00:00:25,826 --> 00:00:31,832
Don't you feel the summer
sun now calling out to you?

5
00:00:31,832 --> 00:00:34,701
Take a walk on the
wild side of life.

6
00:00:37,804 --> 00:00:42,309
Don't waste your time
cruising the city

7
00:00:42,309 --> 00:00:45,279
streets when there's
someone waiting

8
00:00:45,279 --> 00:00:50,284
for you in the summer heat.

9
00:00:50,284 --> 00:00:56,256
You won't believe what you've
been missing all along.

10
00:00:56,256 --> 00:01:02,262
Take my hand, I know
we can't go wrong.

11
00:01:02,262 --> 00:01:08,735
Bikini Summer when the
days are never tame.

12
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:14,741
Bikini summer is
calling out your name.

13
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:20,714
Bikini summer when there's
always more to show.

14
00:01:20,714 --> 00:01:27,721
Bikini summer is
hotter than you know.

15
00:01:27,721 --> 00:01:31,191
Oh, it's so hot.

16
00:01:31,191 --> 00:01:39,700
[inaudible] There's
a place you've

17
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:45,172
dreamed of not so far away.

18
00:01:45,172 --> 00:01:51,144
Where all your
fantasies come true.

19
00:01:51,144 --> 00:01:57,150
Come see the waves crashing
when the surf is high.

20
00:01:57,150 --> 00:02:00,153
You can feel your
heart is pounding,

21
00:02:00,153 --> 00:02:03,623
I can hear your sighs.

22
00:02:03,623 --> 00:02:09,629
There's nowhere else
I would rather be.

23
00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:15,602
Just open up your eyes,
there's so much you can see!

24
00:02:15,602 --> 00:02:22,109
Bikini summer when the
days are never tame.

25
00:02:22,109 --> 00:02:28,582
Bikini summer is
calling out your name.

26
00:02:28,582 --> 00:02:34,087
Bikini summer where there's
always more to show.

27
00:02:34,087 --> 00:02:39,059
Bikini summer, it's
hotter than you know.

28
00:02:39,059 --> 00:02:40,694
Chester.

29
00:02:40,694 --> 00:02:41,495
Chester.

30
00:02:45,866 --> 00:02:48,702
Oh, right.

31
00:02:48,702 --> 00:02:50,470
Number two sandpaper
for the spackling.

32
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:52,172
I totally agree.

33
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:54,841
Mrs. Patterson and I had
moved on to a discussion

34
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:58,645
of proper technique
with the paint brush.

35
00:02:58,645 --> 00:03:01,548
Uh, I knew that Mr. Patterson.

36
00:03:01,548 --> 00:03:03,617
Chester?

37
00:03:03,617 --> 00:03:08,822
Chester, Mrs. Patterson and I
will be returning on the 17th.

38
00:03:08,822 --> 00:03:11,258
That's not a long time.

39
00:03:11,258 --> 00:03:13,060
We trust that you
and your friends

40
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:16,163
understand the amount
of work involved here.

41
00:03:16,163 --> 00:03:17,831
Oh, we do, Mr. Patterson.

42
00:03:17,831 --> 00:03:19,633
We do.

43
00:03:19,633 --> 00:03:21,134
Good.

44
00:03:21,134 --> 00:03:25,839
Now just a few more thoughts
on vertical versus horizontal

45
00:03:25,839 --> 00:03:27,274
brushstrokes.

46
00:03:27,274 --> 00:03:31,478
When using an oil based paint,
the vertical stroke, no more

47
00:03:31,478 --> 00:03:33,246
than eight inches in length--

48
00:03:33,246 --> 00:03:38,218
Wendell, I think you mean
horizontal for oil based.

49
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:43,290
No dear, I recall very
plainly Mr. Wilson down

50
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:44,858
at the paint store telling us--

51
00:03:44,858 --> 00:03:48,228
Mr. Wilson was the nice
man at Carpetland, Wendell.

52
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:51,098
Mr. Cummings was the
gentleman at the paint store.

53
00:03:51,098 --> 00:03:53,266
I'm afraid you're mistaken.

54
00:03:53,266 --> 00:03:57,838
I distinctly remember Mr. Wilson
telling us that in his youth

55
00:03:57,838 --> 00:04:01,408
he had used that particular
brush stroke technique.

56
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:04,244
Whoa, look at that time.

57
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:07,514
Don't you two jet setters
have a plane to catch?

58
00:04:07,514 --> 00:04:09,850
Chester, we've
got three hours.

59
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:11,351
Three hours?

60
00:04:11,351 --> 00:04:13,253
To LAX?

61
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:14,988
Maybe Chester's
right, Wendell.

62
00:04:14,988 --> 00:04:18,992
If there's one thing I know,
Mrs. Patterson, it's traffic.

63
00:04:18,992 --> 00:04:24,297
We'd all be heartbroken if you
missed that big bird to Italy.

64
00:04:24,297 --> 00:04:25,866
Greenland, Chester.

65
00:04:25,866 --> 00:04:27,701
We're going to Greenland.

66
00:04:27,701 --> 00:04:29,102
Greenland?

67
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:30,003
Right!

68
00:04:30,003 --> 00:04:31,872
Boy, do I envy you.

69
00:04:31,872 --> 00:04:33,974
Now don't worry about a thing.

70
00:04:33,974 --> 00:04:36,309
By the time you get
back, me my friends will

71
00:04:36,309 --> 00:04:39,780
have this place looking new.

72
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:42,115
Your father said
we can count on you.

73
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:44,518
My father speaks the truth.

74
00:04:44,518 --> 00:04:46,386
Now get out of town, you two.

75
00:04:49,689 --> 00:04:52,559
I just hope we're doing
the right thing, Martha.

76
00:04:52,559 --> 00:04:54,361
Don't worry, Wendell.

77
00:04:54,361 --> 00:04:57,998
Chester and his friends
seem like fine, responsible

78
00:04:57,998 --> 00:04:59,699
young adults.

[burps]

80
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:08,875
It's got to be
around here somewhere.

81
00:05:08,875 --> 00:05:11,244
Did you see my camera, Renee?

82
00:05:11,244 --> 00:05:12,979
Chet, be careful!

83
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:16,349
I've got all those
fabrics in order.

84
00:05:16,349 --> 00:05:18,285
I can't figure
out where it went.

85
00:05:18,285 --> 00:05:20,487
What do you want
with a camera anyway?

86
00:05:20,487 --> 00:05:23,256
I've never seen you take
a photograph in your life.

87
00:05:23,256 --> 00:05:26,193
I've always admired
the art of photography.

88
00:05:26,193 --> 00:05:27,894
Oh, really?

89
00:05:27,894 --> 00:05:30,564
And is that why last
semester, instead of attending

90
00:05:30,564 --> 00:05:33,400
the Ansel Adams
exhibit with me, you

91
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:37,137
went the monster truck rally?

92
00:05:37,137 --> 00:05:39,272
It's never too
late for one to begin

93
00:05:39,272 --> 00:05:43,143
to express their artistic
sensibilities, Renee.

94
00:05:43,143 --> 00:05:45,679
Chet, this is me
you're talking to, OK?

95
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:47,747
Not one of your bimbos.

96
00:05:47,747 --> 00:05:49,683
And I seem to
recall the last time

97
00:05:49,683 --> 00:05:53,153
you became obsessed with
your artistic sensibilities.

98
00:05:53,153 --> 00:05:54,988
Beginning figure
drawing wasn't it?

99
00:05:54,988 --> 00:05:57,090
I find nothing wrong
in trying to capture

100
00:05:57,090 --> 00:05:58,592
the human female form.

101
00:05:58,592 --> 00:05:59,492
Uh-huh.

102
00:05:59,492 --> 00:06:02,662
In stick figures?

103
00:06:02,662 --> 00:06:04,431
This has really got me nuts.

104
00:06:04,431 --> 00:06:07,767
Chet, I've got work to do, OK?

105
00:06:07,767 --> 00:06:09,569
Maybe it fell out
of my bag when we

106
00:06:09,569 --> 00:06:10,937
were bringing our luggage in.

107
00:06:14,741 --> 00:06:17,143
Richard, my camera's
disappeared.

108
00:06:17,143 --> 00:06:19,779
Consider the
earth's rivers, Chet.

109
00:06:19,779 --> 00:06:21,748
OK.

110
00:06:21,748 --> 00:06:22,649
It hasn't helped.

111
00:06:22,649 --> 00:06:23,683
I still don't know where it is.

112
00:06:23,683 --> 00:06:24,718
That's not the point.

113
00:06:24,718 --> 00:06:26,319
I figured it wasn't.

114
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:28,054
Think of death--

115
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:30,357
death to all those
rivers, rivers

116
00:06:30,357 --> 00:06:31,825
dying because of chemicals.

117
00:06:31,825 --> 00:06:33,760
And where do you think
those chemicals come from?

118
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:34,694
I don't know, Richard.

119
00:06:34,694 --> 00:06:36,062
Where do the
chemicals come from?

120
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:38,131
From factories, Chet.

121
00:06:38,131 --> 00:06:40,634
The same factories
that process film--

122
00:06:40,634 --> 00:06:42,569
film of the kind you're
going to use in that camera

123
00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:44,271
you're looking for.

124
00:06:44,271 --> 00:06:45,805
Thank you for that, Richard.

125
00:06:48,608 --> 00:06:51,211
I do what I can.

Will you stop
bugging me, Chet?

I'm trying to get
ready for the beach.

Do you mind?

139
00:07:36,823 --> 00:07:39,492
I've already wasted
valuable tanning time.

Sorry.

00:07:40,393 --> 00:07:41,361

00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:33,793
There's great exposure here.

184
00:11:41,834 --> 00:11:44,837
Gorgeous.

185
00:11:44,837 --> 00:11:48,508
Hey, you guys need a
break or something?

186
00:11:48,508 --> 00:11:51,377
How about those pina coladas?

187
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:54,447
At least the other
lame-os use that national

188
00:11:54,447 --> 00:11:56,249
magazine cover line
had enough sense

189
00:11:56,249 --> 00:11:57,650
to take off their lens cap.

190
00:12:28,948 --> 00:12:29,949
Hi there.

191
00:12:29,949 --> 00:12:31,918
Oh, hi!

192
00:12:31,918 --> 00:12:33,953
You come here often?

193
00:12:33,953 --> 00:12:35,188
Sure, I do.

194
00:12:35,188 --> 00:12:37,790
I live in the house
right over there.

195
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:39,926
Well, then I'm sure
you want to read this.

196
00:12:39,926 --> 00:12:42,195
It details over
37 deadly traumas

197
00:12:42,195 --> 00:12:46,065
your skin can suffer when
exposed to excessive sunlight.

198
00:12:46,065 --> 00:12:47,934
And then of course,
there's the sand,

199
00:12:47,934 --> 00:12:50,536
which harbors a variety
of poisonous insects,

200
00:12:50,536 --> 00:12:52,338
many of which carry
the bacteria commonly

201
00:12:52,338 --> 00:12:53,373
associated with the plague.

202
00:13:04,984 --> 00:13:08,721
If you guys play really loud--

203
00:13:08,721 --> 00:13:10,456
Loud as we can.

204
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:12,258
Good.

205
00:13:12,258 --> 00:13:14,193
I've been trying to buy
out the guy next door

206
00:13:14,193 --> 00:13:16,896
for the last 10 years.

207
00:13:16,896 --> 00:13:18,297
Now maybe they'll sell.

208
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:33,913
This place is
really incredible.

209
00:13:33,913 --> 00:13:36,916
Look, showers and everything!

210
00:13:36,916 --> 00:13:38,718
Nice, all right.

211
00:13:38,718 --> 00:13:42,155
Oh wow, how are we
going to pay for it?

212
00:13:42,155 --> 00:13:43,322
We'll get a gig.

213
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:45,591
We haven't gotten one yet.

214
00:13:45,591 --> 00:13:46,693
Well, listen.

215
00:13:46,693 --> 00:13:48,494
We've got to practice
some more, you know?

216
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:52,198
I mean, listen you guys, all
we need is a few more songs

217
00:13:52,198 --> 00:13:53,700
and everything is
going to be cool.

218
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:57,704
Now this one is my favorite.

219
00:13:57,704 --> 00:14:01,340
Also the most romantic of mine.

220
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:06,379
You're on the beach, and
it's been a long, hot day.

221
00:14:06,379 --> 00:14:10,917
You've got a really nice tan,
and you've been swimming,

222
00:14:10,917 --> 00:14:12,485
so you feel great!

223
00:14:12,485 --> 00:14:13,286
Alive.

224
00:14:16,022 --> 00:14:20,793
And it's that time in the
afternoon when the light rolls

225
00:14:20,793 --> 00:14:25,998
in, and you're walking
back to your blanket,

226
00:14:25,998 --> 00:14:31,471
and this guy who's been
watching you all day comes up.

227
00:14:31,471 --> 00:14:33,706
Maybe you talk a little.

228
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:37,610
Maybe you watch the
sun go down together.

229
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:38,945
You feel really good--

230
00:14:41,581 --> 00:14:44,851
warm, like the sun.

231
00:14:44,851 --> 00:14:47,353
Yeah.

232
00:14:47,353 --> 00:14:51,224
Tropical Affair.

233
00:14:51,224 --> 00:14:53,793
That's what I'll call it.

234
00:14:53,793 --> 00:14:55,027
Tropical Affair.

235
00:14:58,664 --> 00:15:00,133
Thanks, Mad Dog.

236
00:15:00,133 --> 00:15:01,534
You've been a really big help.

237
00:15:08,775 --> 00:15:11,010
Look at her, dude.

238
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:14,413
Just sitting there,
playing it cool.

239
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:17,216
But I know that,
deep down inside,

240
00:15:17,216 --> 00:15:20,753
that babe is dreaming
about having my children.

241
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:23,956
Do you girls have any idea
what dreadful damage extended

242
00:15:23,956 --> 00:15:25,992
exposure to the sun can cause?

243
00:15:25,992 --> 00:15:28,427
What do you take
us for, morons?

244
00:15:28,427 --> 00:15:31,497
We're more than aware of the
dangers inherent in sunbathing,

245
00:15:31,497 --> 00:15:33,966
which is why we've taken
the precaution of covering

246
00:15:33,966 --> 00:15:35,668
ourselves with sunblock.

247
00:15:35,668 --> 00:15:36,803
From head to toe.

248
00:15:36,803 --> 00:15:39,372
So the harmful rays of
the sun can't penetrate.

249
00:15:39,372 --> 00:15:43,075
To harm our
tender young flesh.

250
00:15:43,075 --> 00:15:45,411
Well, what about
dolphins then?

251
00:15:45,411 --> 00:15:46,946
What about dolphins?

252
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:51,117
Mary is a marine biologist with
a specialty in aquatic mammals.

253
00:15:51,117 --> 00:15:53,019
And so if there's
anything that's troubling

254
00:15:53,019 --> 00:15:55,188
your teensy little mind--

255
00:15:55,188 --> 00:15:56,455
Rainforests!

256
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:57,857
What about them?

257
00:15:57,857 --> 00:16:01,627
Hundreds and thousands of acres
of pristine natural timberland

258
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:02,962
is being destroyed.

259
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:06,432
At a rate of 50 acres per
day, which is robbing our planet

260
00:16:06,432 --> 00:16:08,467
of valuable life giving oxygen.

261
00:16:08,467 --> 00:16:12,772
And contributing to the
destruction of our ozone layer.

262
00:16:12,772 --> 00:16:13,906
Aluminum.

263
00:16:13,906 --> 00:16:17,043
Every day, hundreds and
thousands of tons of--

264
00:16:17,043 --> 00:16:19,312
Of aluminum cans
are being shoveled

265
00:16:19,312 --> 00:16:20,913
into landfills, where--

266
00:16:20,913 --> 00:16:22,949
They'll remain there
without decomposing

267
00:16:22,949 --> 00:16:28,621
for at least 30,000 years.

268
00:16:28,621 --> 00:16:29,422
Yes.

269
00:16:32,091 --> 00:16:34,093
Perfect.

270
00:16:34,093 --> 00:16:35,862
Beautiful!

271
00:16:35,862 --> 00:16:38,865
So when do we find out if
we're going to make the cover?

272
00:16:38,865 --> 00:16:42,435
Oh, it'll be awhile.

273
00:16:42,435 --> 00:16:43,936
You know publishing.

274
00:16:43,936 --> 00:16:45,271
Bummer.

275
00:16:45,271 --> 00:16:47,006
That happened to me once.

276
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:48,407
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.

277
00:16:48,407 --> 00:16:49,208
I was out of film.

278
00:16:53,246 --> 00:16:55,114
I knew that.

279
00:16:55,114 --> 00:16:56,549
[inaudible], listen.

280
00:16:56,549 --> 00:16:58,251
This is OK and
everything, but if we

281
00:16:58,251 --> 00:16:59,785
could go back to
your studio, we could

282
00:16:59,785 --> 00:17:02,188
do some really sexy stuff.

283
00:17:02,188 --> 00:17:06,492
Yeah, I bet you could
get us into "Playboy."

284
00:17:06,492 --> 00:17:09,829
So where is your studio, Chet?

285
00:17:09,829 --> 00:17:10,630
Uh--

286
00:17:32,018 --> 00:17:34,020
Mark, Mark!

287
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:35,855
What's going On

288
00:17:35,855 --> 00:17:37,823
It's happening, dude.

289
00:17:37,823 --> 00:17:39,959
She's looking right
at me, smiling.

290
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:45,665
She's burning up, dude.

291
00:17:51,537 --> 00:17:52,338
She's making her move.

292
00:17:55,841 --> 00:17:59,278
She's coming for my
hot, throbbing love.

293
00:17:59,278 --> 00:18:00,880
I knew she couldn't hold out.

294
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:01,681
Hey, mama.

295
00:18:13,659 --> 00:18:14,627
I'm Brad.

296
00:18:14,627 --> 00:18:15,528
And I'm in love.

297
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:21,033
Geez, Larry.

298
00:18:21,033 --> 00:18:23,769
He's even prettier than she is.

299
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:24,971
Chill out, dude.

300
00:18:24,971 --> 00:18:25,771
OK.

301
00:18:28,407 --> 00:18:34,647
[music playing]

302
00:18:46,492 --> 00:18:48,194
How many times do we
have to go through this

303
00:18:48,194 --> 00:18:49,829
before you guys get it right?

304
00:18:49,829 --> 00:18:51,597
Take it easy, Jazz.

305
00:18:51,597 --> 00:18:53,032
Take it easy?

306
00:18:53,032 --> 00:18:56,569
It's the same
mistake every time.

307
00:18:56,569 --> 00:18:58,604
All it takes is a
little concentration.

308
00:18:58,604 --> 00:18:59,705
We're trying our best.

309
00:18:59,705 --> 00:19:00,873
Well, I'm sick of it!

310
00:19:00,873 --> 00:19:03,442
The rehearsals,
brain's on vacation.

311
00:19:03,442 --> 00:19:06,512
The whole stupid thing!

312
00:19:06,512 --> 00:19:09,382
Cranky, cranky, cranky.

313
00:19:09,382 --> 00:19:11,350
Not her fault. Look
at her love life.

314
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:13,319
What love life?

315
00:19:13,319 --> 00:19:14,453
Tell me about it.

316
00:19:14,453 --> 00:19:15,788
If I hadn't had a guy
as long as she has had,

317
00:19:15,788 --> 00:19:17,390
no telling how cranky I'd be.

318
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:18,624
You?

319
00:19:18,624 --> 00:19:21,293
I'd probably be out stomping
on cute little puppies.

320
00:19:21,293 --> 00:19:23,295
Or running over
old people in my car.

321
00:19:23,295 --> 00:19:25,097
I'd probably just
get a gun and--

322
00:19:25,097 --> 00:19:26,332
OK, OK.

323
00:19:26,332 --> 00:19:28,834
Screw off, all right?

324
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:33,372
Now, are we going to
play this thing or what?

325
00:19:33,372 --> 00:19:36,142
Until I finish my
post-doctoral studies

326
00:19:36,142 --> 00:19:40,713
in Europe, I plan to settle
in one of the Latin American

327
00:19:40,713 --> 00:19:44,150
countries, where I hope to
use my engineering skills

328
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:46,285
to help the Native Americans.

329
00:19:46,285 --> 00:19:48,087
Reclaiming their
birthright in a way

330
00:19:48,087 --> 00:19:51,390
that will have positive
environmental consequences.

331
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:57,930
Well, you two seem to have a
handle on all the major issues.

332
00:19:57,930 --> 00:20:00,366
So I'll just mosey
on down the beach

333
00:20:00,366 --> 00:20:04,070
and see if there's any slackers
that might need my help.

334
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:05,204
Nice meeting you, then.

335
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:06,105
Yeah.

336
00:20:06,105 --> 00:20:06,906
Bye.

337
00:20:10,076 --> 00:20:12,845
Geez, he's the
third environmentalist

338
00:20:12,845 --> 00:20:14,547
we've seen this week!

339
00:20:14,547 --> 00:20:17,216
And so far he's the only
one we didn't sleep with.

340
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:20,453
For such a well-informed
guy, he is kind of--

341
00:20:20,453 --> 00:20:21,253
dumb?

342
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:34,867
Chet, what are you doing?

343
00:20:34,867 --> 00:20:37,103
You ever know a photographer
who didn't have a studio?

344
00:20:42,374 --> 00:20:44,276
When I meet a
real photographer,

345
00:20:44,276 --> 00:20:45,111
I'll let you know.

346
00:20:50,816 --> 00:20:53,152
Stop the condos,
save the beach.

347
00:20:53,152 --> 00:20:57,056
Stop the condos, save the beach.

348
00:20:57,056 --> 00:21:00,426
Stop the condos, save the beach.

349
00:21:00,426 --> 00:21:02,862
Stop the condos, save the beach.

350
00:21:02,862 --> 00:21:06,265
Stop the condos, save the beach.

351
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:08,701
Stop the condos, save the beach.

352
00:21:08,701 --> 00:21:11,170
Stop the condos.

353
00:21:11,170 --> 00:21:12,538
Save our beach.

354
00:21:12,538 --> 00:21:14,773
Sign here.

355
00:21:14,773 --> 00:21:16,775
They're building
condos on our beaches?

356
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:19,078
1,000 units, man.

357
00:21:19,078 --> 00:21:22,248
Tennis courts, parking lots.

358
00:21:22,248 --> 00:21:24,583
The real bummer
is the mini mall.

359
00:21:24,583 --> 00:21:27,286
We get enough signatures
on these petitions,

360
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:29,488
and we get a hearing
with the city council.

361
00:21:29,488 --> 00:21:30,589
How many do you need?

362
00:21:30,589 --> 00:21:31,857
200.

363
00:21:31,857 --> 00:21:32,892
How many do you got?

364
00:21:32,892 --> 00:21:33,893
Counting you?

365
00:21:33,893 --> 00:21:35,227
Eight.

366
00:21:35,227 --> 00:21:37,630
We got a [inaudible]
early this morning.

367
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:40,866
I, for one, can't stand by
while our pristine beaches are

368
00:21:40,866 --> 00:21:43,435
being devastated by
greedy money interests.

369
00:21:43,435 --> 00:21:45,237
You know, if you
don't stop them here,

370
00:21:45,237 --> 00:21:48,307
our entire marine ecosystem
will be destroyed.

371
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:51,544
And not only that, the
beaches will become play lands

372
00:21:51,544 --> 00:21:55,414
for the rich and the poor will
be confined to the inner city,

373
00:21:55,414 --> 00:21:57,883
festering and sweltering
and oppressed!

374
00:21:57,883 --> 00:22:00,819
The cities will burn,
and the only consolation

375
00:22:00,819 --> 00:22:03,722
being that the rich
will destroy themselves

376
00:22:03,722 --> 00:22:07,026
in a degenerate quest
for the perfect tan.

377
00:22:07,026 --> 00:22:11,497
Man, you are one
committed human being.

378
00:22:11,497 --> 00:22:14,200
You know, if I don't start
selling those bikinis soon,

379
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:16,468
I'm in big trouble.

380
00:22:16,468 --> 00:22:17,536
You?

381
00:22:17,536 --> 00:22:22,308
I just spent over $200
on all this stuff!

382
00:22:22,308 --> 00:22:26,545
I'm supposed to
be sympathetic?

383
00:22:26,545 --> 00:22:30,115
A little support of my
artistic dreams might help.

384
00:22:30,115 --> 00:22:31,817
You mean wet dreams.

385
00:22:31,817 --> 00:22:34,286
Don't you, Chet?

386
00:22:34,286 --> 00:22:35,454
Whatever.

387
00:22:35,454 --> 00:22:37,089
It's still costing
me a ton of bucks.

388
00:22:41,527 --> 00:22:43,796
No condos, save our beach.

389
00:22:43,796 --> 00:22:45,764
No condos, save our beach.

390
00:22:45,764 --> 00:22:48,767
No condos, save our beach.

391
00:22:48,767 --> 00:22:51,270
No condos, save our beach.

392
00:22:51,270 --> 00:22:54,740
No condos, save our beach.

393
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:58,244
No condos, save our beach.

394
00:22:58,244 --> 00:22:59,211
Save our beach.

395
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:01,213
No condos, save our beach.

396
00:23:01,213 --> 00:23:04,250
No condos, save our beach.

397
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:06,151
You do not have a
permit for this assembly.

398
00:23:06,151 --> 00:23:07,987
You are now ordered
to leave this area

399
00:23:07,987 --> 00:23:10,022
or face possible arrest.

400
00:23:10,022 --> 00:23:13,058
The Constitution of the
United States of America.

401
00:23:13,058 --> 00:23:14,326
My name is Rachel Green.

402
00:23:14,326 --> 00:23:17,029
I'm the assistant
district attorney,

403
00:23:17,029 --> 00:23:19,598
and you are in violation
of Sections C, F,

404
00:23:19,598 --> 00:23:21,467
and G of the city penal code.

405
00:23:21,467 --> 00:23:23,669
Illegal assembly,
illegal obstruction

406
00:23:23,669 --> 00:23:26,138
of a public thoroughfare,
and in violation

407
00:23:26,138 --> 00:23:28,307
of public noise abatement laws.

408
00:23:28,307 --> 00:23:31,777
You are in violation of
our constitutional rights

409
00:23:31,777 --> 00:23:34,146
as citizens of the
United States of America.

410
00:23:34,146 --> 00:23:39,285
Without a proper permit,
you have no right to assembly.

411
00:23:39,285 --> 00:23:41,220
Link arms.

412
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:42,888
Power to the people!

413
00:23:42,888 --> 00:23:43,889
Come on, man.

414
00:23:43,889 --> 00:23:46,225
Let's-- let's go back to my pad.

415
00:23:46,225 --> 00:23:49,161
We'll mix up a batch
of nice cold martinis

416
00:23:49,161 --> 00:23:51,764
and we'll watch the sun go down.

417
00:23:51,764 --> 00:23:53,499
These are the oppressors, man!

418
00:23:53,499 --> 00:23:54,800
Listen.

419
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:57,436
I spent half the
'60s in the slammer.

420
00:23:57,436 --> 00:23:59,071
I missed Woodstock.

421
00:23:59,071 --> 00:24:01,006
I missed Monterrey.

422
00:24:01,006 --> 00:24:02,641
I don't plan on
missing the '90s.

423
00:24:02,641 --> 00:24:05,044
Thanks.

424
00:24:05,044 --> 00:24:09,348
Well, Martin Luther
King you're not.

425
00:24:09,348 --> 00:24:12,284
Can't you see
what's happening here?

426
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:14,420
The bashing of the baby seals!

427
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:16,889
Dolphins in tunafish cans!

428
00:24:16,889 --> 00:24:19,158
Holes in the ozone layer!

429
00:24:19,158 --> 00:24:22,194
The suffering of our
Native American Indians.

430
00:24:22,194 --> 00:24:22,995
And now this!

431
00:24:26,398 --> 00:24:28,834
It's so obvious!

432
00:24:28,834 --> 00:24:30,302
Book him, Danno.

433
00:24:30,302 --> 00:24:32,204
Cuff him up.

434
00:24:32,204 --> 00:24:33,706
Book him, Danno?

435
00:24:33,706 --> 00:24:36,108
That's Officer Bill
Danno, and so help me

436
00:24:36,108 --> 00:24:37,910
if I hear so much as
one crack out of you,

437
00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:40,312
and I will personally see to it
you spend 48 hours in the tank.

438
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:41,113
Get him out of here.

439
00:24:44,616 --> 00:24:47,920
MAN (ON RADIO): [inaudible]

440
00:24:48,487 --> 00:24:49,555
Bitch!

441
00:24:49,555 --> 00:24:51,657
She knows I hate it
when she says that.

442
00:24:51,657 --> 00:24:55,060
So I guess I'll see
you at the party tonight.

443
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:58,397
- Are you asking me out?
- Yeah, sure.

444
00:25:01,767 --> 00:25:03,602
Then I guess I'll be there.

445
00:25:03,602 --> 00:25:04,403
All right.

446
00:25:09,908 --> 00:25:13,746
[revs engine]

447
00:25:20,753 --> 00:25:23,989
I'm sorry.

448
00:25:23,989 --> 00:25:25,424
Can I help you kids?

449
00:25:25,424 --> 00:25:28,227
Oh, no, that's OK.
OK, then.

450
00:25:28,227 --> 00:25:29,028
I'll see you around.

451
00:25:32,931 --> 00:25:36,568
You see, I told you that
woman really wants me, dude!

452
00:25:36,568 --> 00:25:38,203
You wait here, Larry.

453
00:25:38,203 --> 00:25:39,405
I'll go get the Yugo.

454
00:25:39,405 --> 00:25:40,305
OK, girls.

455
00:25:40,305 --> 00:25:41,907
For the last time.

456
00:25:41,907 --> 00:25:46,278
[music playing]

457
00:26:04,763 --> 00:26:09,735
(SINGING) It's the politician
who pulls your strings.

458
00:26:09,735 --> 00:26:15,207
It ain't any one gives you
money, sex, and things.

459
00:26:15,207 --> 00:26:19,678
Big business is
the earth's decay.

460
00:26:19,678 --> 00:26:24,650
You've been bought to look away.

461
00:26:24,650 --> 00:26:26,952
Hey baby, you busy tonight?

462
00:26:26,952 --> 00:26:29,054
Thanks, but I
already have a date.

463
00:26:29,054 --> 00:26:30,289
So?

464
00:26:30,289 --> 00:26:31,190
So?

465
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:33,459
See you around.

466
00:26:33,459 --> 00:26:37,296
Well, if you want me, you know
where to find me, sweetheart.

Just a [inaudible]

470
00:27:02,588 --> 00:27:07,559
If you don't, your
head will bash.

471
00:27:07,559 --> 00:27:13,065
Mr. Bush does not tax the rich.

472
00:27:13,065 --> 00:27:18,537
Isn't that sort of a bitch?

473
00:27:18,537 --> 00:27:23,542
Seems like everything
is going wrong.

474
00:27:23,542 --> 00:27:28,514
I've got restless
feelings in my soul.

475
00:27:28,514 --> 00:27:34,019
Rage and anger are
growing strong.

476
00:27:34,019 --> 00:27:38,924
Making me start to lose control.

477
00:27:51,470 --> 00:27:54,907
Hey, do you two guys
know a guy named Brad?

478
00:27:54,907 --> 00:27:56,909
Sure, why?

479
00:27:56,909 --> 00:27:59,244
Because I just can't
find him, and I'm supposed

480
00:27:59,244 --> 00:28:01,246
to have a date with him.

481
00:28:01,246 --> 00:28:02,948
Well, we haven't seen him.

482
00:28:02,948 --> 00:28:05,851
Sorry.

I can't believe
it, just look around.

A lot of BS is going down.

Pull your head
out of the ground.

I don't know.

Almost?

We have played this

cramped they feel

Come on, Jazz.
We're tired.

Give it a rest.

All right, all right.

But if we don't
hammer this song soon,

504
00:29:15,354 --> 00:29:17,422
I'm going to lose my mind!

Hey, you were fighting
for what you believed in.

Yeah, all by myself.

523
00:31:22,981 --> 00:31:24,716

OK, Richard.

I can't afford to bail

Come on, Michelle.

544
00:33:00,512 --> 00:33:02,380
Be cool.

545
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:04,216
Michelle, don't be a downer.

546
00:33:04,216 --> 00:33:09,554
[music playing]

547
00:33:30,976 --> 00:33:33,378
[laughs]

548
00:33:58,270 --> 00:34:00,639
Oh, I forgot my shampoo!

549
00:34:00,639 --> 00:34:01,706
I'm going to go get it.

550
00:34:07,045 --> 00:34:09,514
Hello, Max.

551
00:34:09,514 --> 00:34:10,382
Having fun?

552
00:34:18,657 --> 00:34:20,759
Hey, did you ever find Brad?

553
00:34:20,759 --> 00:34:22,160
Tell me something.

554
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:24,629
What is it with good
looking guys, huh?

555
00:34:24,629 --> 00:34:26,665
They think that all
they have to do is smile

556
00:34:26,665 --> 00:34:30,535
and every girl within 100 miles
is going to stand in line.

557
00:34:30,535 --> 00:34:31,870
Looks like you found Brad.

558
00:34:35,206 --> 00:34:36,808
No wonder that
creep is going to let

559
00:34:36,808 --> 00:34:38,376
us pay at the end of the month.

560
00:34:38,376 --> 00:34:39,644
I thought something
was strange when

561
00:34:39,644 --> 00:34:43,014
he said he loved our music.

562
00:34:43,014 --> 00:34:45,116
Did you see the
look on his face

563
00:34:45,116 --> 00:34:48,653
when you called him a
perverted slime bucket?

564
00:34:48,653 --> 00:34:50,121
How about scumbag from hell?

565
00:34:50,121 --> 00:34:53,058
That was a classic, Jazz.

566
00:34:53,058 --> 00:34:55,927
Yeah, but the fact is that
we lost our rehearsal hall.

567
00:34:55,927 --> 00:34:57,295
Come on, Jazz.

568
00:34:57,295 --> 00:35:00,298
That dirt sucking pig deserved
everything you threw at him.

569
00:35:00,298 --> 00:35:02,133
We could have
showered at home.

570
00:35:02,133 --> 00:35:04,302
We'd still have a
place to practice.

571
00:35:04,302 --> 00:35:07,839
But, as always, I had
to go and lose my cool.

572
00:35:14,212 --> 00:35:19,584
[piano playing]

573
00:35:33,098 --> 00:35:34,966
Ugh, oh, mm.

574
00:36:28,253 --> 00:36:32,290
[music playing]

575
00:39:32,704 --> 00:39:35,673
How dare you spy on me!

576
00:39:35,673 --> 00:39:37,909
- But it's my pool.
- Oh yeah?

577
00:39:37,909 --> 00:39:40,178
If you live here, then how come
I didn't see you at the party

578
00:39:40,178 --> 00:39:41,346
last night?

579
00:39:41,346 --> 00:39:43,481
I was up in my room
working all night.

580
00:39:43,481 --> 00:39:44,849
It was my brother's party.

581
00:39:44,849 --> 00:39:47,185
And I suppose now that you've
seen me naked you think you

582
00:39:47,185 --> 00:39:50,088
can just jump my bones, right?

583
00:39:50,088 --> 00:39:52,223
Listen, I just got this
great idea for a song.

584
00:39:52,223 --> 00:39:53,858
I've got to get back to
the piano to work it out,

585
00:39:53,858 --> 00:39:55,593
all right?
- A songwriter?

586
00:39:55,593 --> 00:39:56,494
Yeah.

587
00:39:56,494 --> 00:39:57,395
Geez.

588
00:39:57,395 --> 00:39:58,663
What a lame line.

589
00:39:58,663 --> 00:40:00,832
You really think I'm
going to fall for that?

590
00:40:00,832 --> 00:40:03,635
You're all the same.

591
00:40:03,635 --> 00:40:07,405
If it isn't pretty
guys, it's lame lines.

592
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:08,439
I'm sorry.

593
00:40:08,439 --> 00:40:09,574
Just cool down, OK?

594
00:40:09,574 --> 00:40:10,708
Right.

595
00:40:10,708 --> 00:40:13,111
And now you probably
want to give me a massage

596
00:40:13,111 --> 00:40:16,180
to make me relax a little, huh?

597
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:21,686
But you're badly mistaken if
you think I was born yesterday.

598
00:40:21,686 --> 00:40:22,987
Put it on, OK?

599
00:40:22,987 --> 00:40:25,256
Oh, the perfect gentleman bit.

600
00:40:25,256 --> 00:40:26,858
You think I haven't
seen that one?

601
00:40:26,858 --> 00:40:28,259
You need something to wear!

602
00:40:28,259 --> 00:40:32,997
Oh no fun if you can't talk
me out of my clothes, is it?

603
00:40:32,997 --> 00:40:35,867
I read you like a book, mister!

604
00:40:35,867 --> 00:40:42,373
Because if there's one
thing I know about, men.

605
00:40:42,373 --> 00:40:43,775
There's one thing I know.

606
00:40:43,775 --> 00:40:45,209
It's women.

607
00:40:45,209 --> 00:40:47,912
They have to be
posed very carefully

608
00:40:47,912 --> 00:40:52,116
to highlight every nuance.

609
00:40:52,116 --> 00:40:53,051
What are we going to wear?

610
00:40:53,051 --> 00:40:54,552
Huh?

611
00:40:54,552 --> 00:40:56,521
We're certainly not
going to wear these.

612
00:40:56,521 --> 00:40:59,390
Yeah, big time photographers
always have lots of neat stuff

613
00:40:59,390 --> 00:41:00,425
to wear.

614
00:41:00,425 --> 00:41:01,225
Oh.

615
00:41:04,162 --> 00:41:05,029
Uh, right.

616
00:41:08,466 --> 00:41:11,135
Where did I put my--

617
00:41:11,135 --> 00:41:12,470
stuff to wear.

618
00:41:18,176 --> 00:41:19,110
[knocks]

619
00:41:19,110 --> 00:41:21,913
Art waits for no man, ladies.

620
00:41:21,913 --> 00:41:22,714
Just one second.

621
00:41:25,350 --> 00:41:26,284
OK, we're ready.

622
00:41:29,354 --> 00:41:35,727
[music playing]

623
00:44:47,585 --> 00:44:50,221
Boy oh boy, I just
had this great dream

624
00:44:50,221 --> 00:44:51,022
where this girl was--

625
00:44:53,925 --> 00:44:56,327
Chet, we're all so
delighted that your sort

626
00:44:56,327 --> 00:44:59,564
of little subconscious
made you so happy.

627
00:44:59,564 --> 00:45:00,865
Is summer over?

628
00:45:00,865 --> 00:45:01,666
Or what?

629
00:45:04,335 --> 00:45:06,904
Considering the fact
that my bikinis were stolen?

630
00:45:06,904 --> 00:45:07,838
Yes!

631
00:45:07,838 --> 00:45:10,374
I'd say summer is
definitely over.

632
00:45:10,374 --> 00:45:12,643
I suppose it
doesn't much matter.

633
00:45:12,643 --> 00:45:15,446
I didn't sell any anyway.

634
00:45:15,446 --> 00:45:17,682
That shouldn't be a problem.

635
00:45:17,682 --> 00:45:21,686
According to the girls I shot
this afternoon, they loved them.

636
00:45:21,686 --> 00:45:24,188
- They stole my bikinis?
- No, no, no, no, no.

637
00:45:24,188 --> 00:45:25,089
I stole them.

638
00:45:25,089 --> 00:45:27,191
I mean, I borrowed them.

639
00:45:27,191 --> 00:45:29,594
Renee, you're a hit.

640
00:45:29,594 --> 00:45:31,862
Don't try to
squirm out of this!

641
00:45:31,862 --> 00:45:34,332
You probably gave those
Barbie dolls bikinis

642
00:45:34,332 --> 00:45:36,867
because you couldn't pay them.

643
00:45:36,867 --> 00:45:40,338
Actually, they paid me.

644
00:45:40,338 --> 00:45:41,739
I wanted to return
them because they

645
00:45:41,739 --> 00:45:44,475
offered me twice your price.

646
00:45:44,475 --> 00:45:45,776
They really liked them?

647
00:45:45,776 --> 00:45:48,012
No kidding, they flipped!

648
00:45:48,012 --> 00:45:50,214
I swear, if we could just
find a way to show off

649
00:45:50,214 --> 00:45:51,616
those bikinis of yours you'll--

650
00:45:58,990 --> 00:46:01,659
so simple!

651
00:46:01,659 --> 00:46:05,029
It's brilliant.

652
00:46:05,029 --> 00:46:08,699
A bikini contest.

653
00:46:08,699 --> 00:46:11,135
We'll [inaudible]
the bar someplace,

654
00:46:11,135 --> 00:46:14,472
and you'll sell as many
bikinis as you can make!

655
00:46:14,472 --> 00:46:15,640
Just where are
they going to wear

656
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:17,475
these bikinis when
they turn our beach

657
00:46:17,475 --> 00:46:20,544
into a parking lot for condos?

658
00:46:20,544 --> 00:46:25,449
We'll make the
contest a fundraiser.

659
00:46:25,449 --> 00:46:28,953
We'll raise money to
help save the beach!

660
00:46:28,953 --> 00:46:30,187
Yeah!

661
00:46:30,187 --> 00:46:32,990
And then I can get everyone
to sign the petition!

662
00:46:32,990 --> 00:46:37,094
Of course we're going
to need some music.

663
00:46:37,094 --> 00:46:41,866
I wonder if anybody around here
knows of some hot young band.

664
00:46:41,866 --> 00:46:42,667
All right!

665
00:46:45,670 --> 00:46:48,906
We're going to
need contestants.

666
00:46:48,906 --> 00:46:52,209
Of course, you probably
don't want to enter.

667
00:46:52,209 --> 00:46:53,177
No.

668
00:46:53,177 --> 00:46:55,246
Sure.

669
00:46:55,246 --> 00:46:56,914
You don't want to
spend your evening

670
00:46:56,914 --> 00:47:03,354
with a room full of
environmentally conscious men.

671
00:47:03,354 --> 00:47:05,423
No, on second thought,
it's better that you don't

672
00:47:05,423 --> 00:47:06,657
enter something like that.

673
00:47:06,657 --> 00:47:12,296
I mean, the crowd would just
be totally uncontrolled.

674
00:47:12,296 --> 00:47:13,264
OK, OK.

675
00:47:13,264 --> 00:47:14,165
I'll [inaudible].

676
00:47:14,165 --> 00:47:16,634
[laughs]

677
00:47:16,634 --> 00:47:19,704
I don't suppose you
have an angle, do you?

678
00:47:19,704 --> 00:47:20,604
Me?

679
00:47:20,604 --> 00:47:22,373
No.

680
00:47:22,373 --> 00:47:25,576
Organizational stuff.

681
00:47:25,576 --> 00:47:30,448
Radio, possibly a little TV.

682
00:47:30,448 --> 00:47:34,552
Maybe shoot a calendar with
the contestants featured!

683
00:47:34,552 --> 00:47:37,621
Media tie-ins,
merchandising tie-ins.

684
00:47:37,621 --> 00:47:40,057
[inaudible]

685
00:47:40,057 --> 00:47:41,258
What about Mad Dog?

686
00:47:45,863 --> 00:47:48,632
[inaudible]

687
00:47:48,632 --> 00:47:50,034
[burps]

688
00:48:33,677 --> 00:48:36,180
It's just so strange.

689
00:48:36,180 --> 00:48:38,482
Like a big boy or something.

690
00:48:38,482 --> 00:48:41,485
And the living room
looks so much larger.

691
00:48:41,485 --> 00:48:43,687
I wonder where he went?

692
00:48:43,687 --> 00:48:47,191
All I know is he was gone
when I got up this morning.

693
00:48:47,191 --> 00:48:49,160
Mad Dog went to go
see a man about beer.

694
00:48:49,160 --> 00:48:50,294
All right?

695
00:48:50,294 --> 00:48:51,662
Now will you two just
go away or something?

696
00:48:51,662 --> 00:48:53,130
I cannot concentrate!

697
00:48:53,130 --> 00:48:55,065
God, what's the
problem with her?

698
00:48:55,065 --> 00:48:57,835
I'll tell you
what's wrong with me.

699
00:48:57,835 --> 00:49:00,905
Does this look even
remotely sexy to you?

700
00:49:00,905 --> 00:49:03,274
Have you tried it on yet?

701
00:49:03,274 --> 00:49:06,277
No, but yeah, maybe
that's a good idea.

702
00:49:06,277 --> 00:49:07,344
You won't?

703
00:49:07,344 --> 00:49:08,746
I will.

704
00:49:08,746 --> 00:49:11,749
Don't waste your time.

705
00:49:11,749 --> 00:49:13,651
All washed up anyway.

706
00:49:13,651 --> 00:49:16,487
My mother said I should
become a librarian.

707
00:49:16,487 --> 00:49:19,690
Now I know she's right.

708
00:49:19,690 --> 00:49:24,628
Two more years of college, buy
myself a nice quiet little town

709
00:49:24,628 --> 00:49:27,731
with a stuffy little
library, spend

710
00:49:27,731 --> 00:49:30,634
the rest of my life telling
little brats to shut up.

711
00:49:33,304 --> 00:49:35,272
I'll probably die an old maid.

712
00:49:35,272 --> 00:49:37,374
A very wet old maid.

Maybe you're right.

720
00:50:40,871 --> 00:50:43,007
Maybe you are all washed up.

721
00:50:53,183 --> 00:50:55,319
Get away from me.

722
00:50:55,319 --> 00:50:59,523
I don't want to hear anything
about skin diseases or insects

who carry the black plague.

724
00:51:00,925 --> 00:51:03,861
The last time I talked to you,
I couldn't sleep for three days.

725
00:51:03,861 --> 00:51:05,296
No, it's not about that.

726
00:51:05,296 --> 00:51:09,333
It's a bikini contest to raise
money to help save the beach.

727
00:51:09,333 --> 00:51:10,768
Save the beach?

728
00:51:10,768 --> 00:51:12,303
What do you mean by that?

729
00:51:12,303 --> 00:51:13,871
From the developers.

730
00:51:13,871 --> 00:51:17,942
From the ruthless, capitalist
exploiters, the land bearers.

731
00:51:17,942 --> 00:51:21,612
The oppressors of the
working man everywhere.

732
00:51:21,612 --> 00:51:24,782
With their running dog lackeys
and their tired political

733
00:51:24,782 --> 00:51:27,851
bosses, driven only by greed.

734
00:51:27,851 --> 00:51:30,955
Couldn't I just enter
the contest for fun?

735
00:51:30,955 --> 00:51:34,558
Well, gosh, yes.

736
00:51:34,558 --> 00:51:35,859
I guess you could.

737
00:51:35,859 --> 00:51:36,827
Thanks.

738
00:51:36,827 --> 00:51:39,496
And listen, if I
see any running dog

739
00:51:39,496 --> 00:51:43,500
lackeys in the neighborhood,
you'll be the first to know.

740
00:51:43,500 --> 00:51:46,303
Oh my god.

741
00:51:46,303 --> 00:51:48,472
She's coming towards us, Larry.

742
00:51:48,472 --> 00:51:49,273
What are we going to do?

743
00:51:52,943 --> 00:51:54,878
And I hope to
see you both there.

744
00:52:01,018 --> 00:52:04,955
Maybe you two could do me a big
favor the night of the contest.

745
00:52:04,955 --> 00:52:06,223
Sure, no problem.

746
00:52:06,223 --> 00:52:07,124
Great.

747
00:52:07,124 --> 00:52:08,826
Just come early, OK?

748
00:52:08,826 --> 00:52:09,626
And ask for Sheryl.

749
00:52:14,898 --> 00:52:16,600
Thanks, Sheryl.
We'll be there.

750
00:52:20,070 --> 00:52:26,443
[music playing]

751
00:52:57,841 --> 00:53:00,210
Well, I must say.

752
00:53:00,210 --> 00:53:01,845
I'm surprised at you.

753
00:53:01,845 --> 00:53:04,314
You certainly [inaudible] for
such an obviously sexist event.

754
00:53:04,314 --> 00:53:07,051
But it's to help raise
money to save the beach.

755
00:53:07,051 --> 00:53:10,120
By exploiting the active
use of women's bodies

756
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:13,357
for the lustful cravings of
chauvinistic male morons?

757
00:53:13,357 --> 00:53:14,458
But--

758
00:53:14,458 --> 00:53:18,562
In other words, we
think it's a great idea.

759
00:53:18,562 --> 00:53:21,732
Where do we sign?

760
00:53:21,732 --> 00:53:25,102
[piano playing]

761
00:53:53,597 --> 00:53:56,967
[knocks]

762
00:54:06,043 --> 00:54:06,944
Hi.

763
00:54:06,944 --> 00:54:09,246
Hi.

764
00:54:09,246 --> 00:54:11,248
Oh, here's a robe.

765
00:54:11,248 --> 00:54:14,585
Thanks.
Uh, listen.

766
00:54:14,585 --> 00:54:16,820
I've got to get back
to work on this song.

767
00:54:16,820 --> 00:54:19,289
Just one more thing.

768
00:54:19,289 --> 00:54:23,594
There's this contest
tomorrow night.

769
00:54:23,594 --> 00:54:25,329
Bikini contest?

770
00:54:25,329 --> 00:54:26,530
I'm in it.

771
00:54:26,530 --> 00:54:31,735
And I thought, if you
weren't too busy, maybe--

772
00:54:31,735 --> 00:54:33,070
Well, I don't know.

773
00:54:33,070 --> 00:54:33,971
All right.

774
00:54:33,971 --> 00:54:34,771
Just thought I'd ask.

775
00:54:45,015 --> 00:54:47,317
[music playing]

776
00:54:49,887 --> 00:54:52,222
I just finished
counting the profits.

777
00:54:52,222 --> 00:54:53,924
We make some kind of team.

778
00:54:53,924 --> 00:54:55,425
That's great, Renee.

779
00:54:55,425 --> 00:54:59,630
I thought a celebration
might be in order, my treat.

780
00:54:59,630 --> 00:55:00,531
Maybe some other time.

781
00:55:00,531 --> 00:55:01,331
OK?

782
00:55:03,734 --> 00:55:04,535
Look at yourself!

783
00:55:08,105 --> 00:55:11,141
Every time you look at one of
those Barbie dolls in a bikini,

784
00:55:11,141 --> 00:55:15,312
you get that same moronic
grin on your face.

785
00:55:15,312 --> 00:55:16,680
My god, Chet.

786
00:55:16,680 --> 00:55:19,183
You really do only have one
thing on your mind, don't you?

787
00:55:25,756 --> 00:55:30,127
[music playing]

788
00:55:35,199 --> 00:55:38,068

790
00:56:23,413 --> 00:56:26,250
[inaudible] sign the petition?

791
00:56:33,490 --> 00:56:34,391
[inaudible], dude.

792
00:56:34,391 --> 00:56:35,192
Where do we sign?

793
00:57:13,363 --> 00:57:15,399
And don't forget, guys.

794
00:57:15,399 --> 00:57:18,535
Chet Marley Productions
is proud to support

795
00:57:18,535 --> 00:57:21,004
the Save the Beach foundation.

796
00:57:21,004 --> 00:57:22,205
So during the course
of the evening,

797
00:57:22,205 --> 00:57:24,041
get on over to pick
up your t-shirt

798
00:57:24,041 --> 00:57:26,443
and your hot bikini calendar.

799
00:57:30,213 --> 00:57:33,583
And remember, for
every dollar, we donate

800
00:57:33,583 --> 00:57:36,653
$0.25 to help save the beach!

801
00:57:36,653 --> 00:57:40,023
Save the beach, save
the beach, save the beach,

802
00:57:40,023 --> 00:57:44,928
save the beach, save the beach,
save the beach, save the beach.

803
00:57:44,928 --> 00:57:46,330
Now, now, now.

804
00:57:46,330 --> 00:57:51,335
For our first contestant, let's
give a big welcome for Sherri!

805
00:57:51,335 --> 00:57:54,304
[cheering]

806
00:57:54,304 --> 00:57:58,008
Sherri is a fine
arts student at UCLA.

807
00:57:58,008 --> 00:58:00,377
Sherri, what turns
you on about a guy?

808
00:58:00,377 --> 00:58:03,413
I like guys who can really
appreciate that beauty

809
00:58:03,413 --> 00:58:05,716
mother nature has created.

810
00:58:05,716 --> 00:58:07,351
Like the beach we're trying
to save here tonight.

811
00:58:10,220 --> 00:58:12,923
I wonder, could there be
any guys in the audience

812
00:58:12,923 --> 00:58:14,925
like that tonight?

813
00:58:14,925 --> 00:58:17,394
[cheering]

814
00:58:18,395 --> 00:58:20,364
Take it away, Sherri!

815
00:58:20,364 --> 00:58:24,234

816
00:58:48,592 --> 00:58:51,461

[cheering]

818
00:58:58,468 --> 00:59:00,971
Thank you, Sherri.

819
00:59:00,971 --> 00:59:04,608
And now, our second
contestant is Sissy.

820
00:59:07,744 --> 00:59:10,480
Now Sissy, you study law.

821
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:11,648
Why is that?

822
00:59:11,648 --> 00:59:13,517
So I can fight all
those mean developers that

823
00:59:13,517 --> 00:59:15,218
want to take away our people.

824
00:59:15,218 --> 00:59:16,520
[cheers]

825
00:59:18,054 --> 00:59:21,124
Anybody interested in
fighting alongside Sissy?

826
00:59:21,124 --> 00:59:22,793
[cheers]

827
00:59:25,762 --> 00:59:28,398
Go for it, Sissy.

828
00:59:28,398 --> 00:59:32,769
[music playing]

829
01:00:01,832 --> 01:00:04,067
And this is being
brought to you by Live

01:00:04,067 --> 01:00:13,810
on Renegade Radio, Malibu's own
underground station, 102.8 FM.

832
01:00:26,289 --> 01:00:27,757
And here's our next
contestant, Becky!

833
01:00:27,757 --> 01:00:31,261
A bio chem major
from Pismo Beach.

834
01:00:31,261 --> 01:00:35,165
[cheering]

835
01:01:01,191 --> 01:01:05,795
And next we have,
Shannon, an aerobics major?

836
01:01:05,795 --> 01:01:06,596
Right.

837
01:01:21,678 --> 01:01:24,548
[cheering]

838
01:01:48,605 --> 01:01:52,142
There just seems
to be so much fabric.

839
01:01:52,142 --> 01:01:55,178
Any less fabric,
and you'd be naked.

840
01:01:55,178 --> 01:01:56,713
Maybe then I'd have
a better chance.

841
01:01:56,713 --> 01:01:59,249
And here's Holly, a
budding young actress

842
01:01:59,249 --> 01:02:00,617
from Muncie, Indiana!

843
01:02:11,461 --> 01:02:12,462
So when you go on?

844
01:02:12,462 --> 01:02:14,230
In awhile.

845
01:02:14,230 --> 01:02:16,166
I wish I'd never
entered this thing.

846
01:02:16,166 --> 01:02:17,067
Come on, Sheryl.

847
01:02:17,067 --> 01:02:19,369
You look fantastic!

848
01:02:19,369 --> 01:02:21,805
It's not what I mean.

849
01:02:21,805 --> 01:02:23,440
Maybe if I just lost my top.

850
01:02:23,440 --> 01:02:28,345
[music playing]

851
01:03:00,877 --> 01:03:06,249
And now, you all know
her, Malibu's own, Cheryl.

01:05:09,606 --> 01:05:11,107
Chet, what's happening?

858
01:05:11,107 --> 01:05:12,509
I don't know.

859
01:05:12,509 --> 01:05:14,144
We're hereby ordered to
leave these premises in

860
01:05:14,144 --> 01:05:16,379
a peaceful and orderly manner.

861
01:05:19,783 --> 01:05:22,619
She can't do that.

862
01:05:22,619 --> 01:05:25,555
Can she?

863
01:05:25,555 --> 01:05:27,791
If you do not
disburse immediately,

864
01:05:27,791 --> 01:05:30,360
I will initiate
arrest proceedings.

865
01:05:34,264 --> 01:05:37,133
Wait a minute.

866
01:05:37,133 --> 01:05:39,636
Are you the organizer
of this affair?

867
01:05:39,636 --> 01:05:40,670
Yeah!

868
01:05:40,670 --> 01:05:41,905
I mean, I--

869
01:05:41,905 --> 01:05:44,307
You're in violation of
municipal penal code Section

870
01:05:44,307 --> 01:05:49,379
F, Paragraph 13, perpetration of
a lewd and licentious display.

871
01:05:49,379 --> 01:05:51,014
Wait a second here.

872
01:05:51,014 --> 01:05:53,616
My bikinis are not
lewd and licentious!

873
01:05:53,616 --> 01:05:55,485
And just who are you?

874
01:05:55,485 --> 01:05:57,887
I'm Renee, Bikinis by Renee?

875
01:05:57,887 --> 01:05:59,989
I designed every one
of these bikinis.

876
01:05:59,989 --> 01:06:01,124
I made them and--

877
01:06:01,124 --> 01:06:04,527
And contributed to the
exploitation of women.

878
01:06:04,527 --> 01:06:06,496
No!

879
01:06:06,496 --> 01:06:11,401
My bikinis are-- beautiful!

880
01:06:11,401 --> 01:06:13,570
Then why aren't
you wearing one?

881
01:06:13,570 --> 01:06:17,874
I-- I'm not in the contest!

882
01:06:17,874 --> 01:06:19,642
And maybe that's
because you have

883
01:06:19,642 --> 01:06:22,779
no desire to cater to the
prurient interest of this--

884
01:06:22,779 --> 01:06:23,646
this mob!

885
01:06:38,795 --> 01:06:40,830
You are hereby
ordered to be quiet.

886
01:06:56,846 --> 01:06:58,815

01:07:05,788 --> 01:07:08,591
I have here in my hand
a court order instructing

890
01:07:08,591 --> 01:07:10,960
me to repossess the musical
instruments belonging

891
01:07:10,960 --> 01:07:15,098

Give us a break.

01:07:24,807 --> 01:07:27,877
Unless you can produce eight
months of overdue payments

Hey, listen.

01:07:43,960 --> 01:07:46,129
I don't know who you are, but
we don't have any money, and--

902
01:07:46,129 --> 01:07:49,232
Consider that money an
advance against your royalties.

903
01:07:49,232 --> 01:07:50,400

You're great.

907
01:07:54,604 --> 01:07:55,505

Give me those petitions!

933
01:08:51,294 --> 01:08:53,062
These subversive

934
01:08:53,062 --> 01:08:54,430

935
01:08:54,430 --> 01:08:56,165
It's not fair.

936
01:08:56,165 --> 01:08:58,568
You are the developer?

937
01:08:58,568 --> 01:09:00,136
You can use the

938
01:09:00,136 --> 01:09:02,038
Why, you slime ball!

01:09:02,038 --> 01:09:04,941
You dirty, perverted sleazebag!

01:09:04,941 --> 01:09:06,442
You, you!

You exploiter of the people
and decent women everywhere!

943
01:09:11,581 --> 01:09:15,184
Max, what is
she talking about?

944
01:09:15,184 --> 01:09:16,285
Tell her, Max.

945
01:09:16,285 --> 01:09:17,387
What?

946
01:09:17,387 --> 01:09:18,821
I was trying to fix

947
01:09:18,821 --> 01:09:20,189
Right.

948
01:09:20,189 --> 01:09:22,025
And the hole in the wall just
happened to be in the shower

949
01:09:22,025 --> 01:09:24,660
room, and you just happened
to be peeking through it

950
01:09:24,660 --> 01:09:26,262

You're going to believe
this little twerp?

953
01:09:34,637 --> 01:09:37,940
What I may do is bring you
up on some pretty nasty vice

955
01:09:39,208 --> 01:09:42,045
Not to mention invasion of

Without a proper

979
01:10:26,389 --> 01:10:29,726

980
01:10:29,726 --> 01:10:31,060
Mad Dog!

981
01:10:31,060 --> 01:10:33,596

984
01:10:57,920 --> 01:11:02,592
Therefore and hereupon, unless
a proper license to sell beer

985
01:11:02,592 --> 01:11:05,895
is produced, I will order
this establishment closed

01:11:09,365 --> 01:11:13,402
Well now, just hold on a

And just who are you?

990
01:11:14,637 --> 01:11:15,972
Conners.

991
01:11:15,972 --> 01:11:20,443

01:11:27,350 --> 01:11:28,284
Whoa, girl.

01:11:28,284 --> 01:11:29,919
I just came down

998
01:11:29,919 --> 01:11:32,355

999
01:11:32,355 --> 01:11:36,492
I'm telling you this boy's got
the fire of a preacher in him.

1000
01:11:36,492 --> 01:11:40,396
Ain't nobody held big Earl's
ear for that long a spell.

1001
01:11:40,396 --> 01:11:44,233
Three full hours on this
here bikini contest alone,

1002
01:11:44,233 --> 01:11:47,003

Then he shows me pictures
of these two fine young ladies

1011
01:12:14,363 --> 01:12:19,468
here, and my big
old Texas heart got

1012
01:12:19,468 --> 01:12:21,571
to throbbing something awful.

1013
01:12:21,571 --> 01:12:24,473
I'm telling you,
the boy's a genius.

1014
01:12:24,473 --> 01:12:26,309
You're obstructing
justice here, Mr. Conners.

1015
01:12:26,309 --> 01:12:27,210
And if you--

1016
01:12:27,210 --> 01:12:29,946
Well, bust my boots.

1017
01:12:29,946 --> 01:12:34,183
