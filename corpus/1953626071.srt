1
00:00:15,472 --> 00:00:19,739
Batman, now that I'm the Queen
of crime in Gotham City,

2
00:00:19,766 --> 00:00:24,223
who better to be my King than the guy
who puts the A in Alpha Male?

3
00:00:24,239 --> 00:00:26,634
You may call yourself
a Queen, Poison Ivy,

4
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:28,751
but to me you're
just a common crook.

5
00:00:28,783 --> 00:00:32,023
You dare mock me?
Very well...

6
00:00:32,046 --> 00:00:35,406
Flower Children,
feed him to Georgia.

7
00:00:49,028 --> 00:00:51,089
You'll make a tasty appetiser...

8
00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:55,123
Before I serve her the main course,
your precious Gotham!

9
00:00:55,165 --> 00:00:57,861
We will stop you,
you herbaceous hussy!

10
00:00:57,923 --> 00:01:00,528
- "We...?"
- Yes, me...

11
00:01:00,706 --> 00:01:02,697
And the Black Orchid.

12
00:01:08,848 --> 00:01:11,237
Hop at her,
my broken blossoms!

13
00:01:32,338 --> 00:01:34,067
Georgia, my baby!

14
00:02:11,587 --> 00:02:15,577
I'll give you one last chance
to choose me over oblivion.

15
00:02:15,615 --> 00:02:17,207
What do you say?

16
00:02:17,501 --> 00:02:20,664
"Leaves are free,
let them be."

17
00:02:31,463 --> 00:02:33,795
Thanks for the assist,
Black Orchid.

18
00:02:34,611 --> 00:02:36,442
Black Orchid...?

19
00:02:37,336 --> 00:02:40,499
Now I know how
Commissioner Gordon feels.

20
00:03:10,224 --> 00:03:12,029
BATMAN:
THE BRAVE AND THE BOLD

21
00:03:12,147 --> 00:03:15,147
Transcripted by Reef
addic7ed.com

22
00:03:15,389 --> 00:03:20,163
THE MASK OF MATCHES MALONE!

23
00:03:33,492 --> 00:03:34,868
CLOAK OF NEFERTITI

24
00:03:37,756 --> 00:03:40,434
Just like catnip to me.

25
00:03:44,409 --> 00:03:49,472
The two-sided cloak of Nefertiti,
given to her by the cat-goddess Bast.

26
00:03:50,952 --> 00:03:53,915
They say it gives each person
who wears it nine lives.

27
00:03:53,962 --> 00:03:55,887
Of course you'd try for it,
Catwoman.

28
00:03:55,934 --> 00:04:01,050
Batman. Couldn't let the cat have
a yawn for one minute, could you?

29
00:04:02,888 --> 00:04:06,369
Surrender, and save me the trouble
of putting a leash on you!

30
00:04:12,698 --> 00:04:15,462
Now, what fun would that be?

31
00:04:28,617 --> 00:04:31,911
Ahem, are we interrupting
something?

32
00:04:32,752 --> 00:04:35,516
'Cause it sure looks like
we're interrupting something...

33
00:04:35,555 --> 00:04:37,817
Huntress, Black Canary.

34
00:04:38,024 --> 00:04:40,458
I was just...
We were just...

35
00:04:40,626 --> 00:04:42,526
I can handle Catwoman
on my own.

36
00:04:42,695 --> 00:04:46,946
So we see, Romeo. But, uh,
we're not here to stop Catwoman.

37
00:04:56,642 --> 00:04:58,405
We're here to stop Two-Face.

38
00:04:58,467 --> 00:05:00,905
Looks like there's too many guests
at the party...

39
00:05:01,013 --> 00:05:03,140
And not enough favors
to go around.

40
00:05:03,315 --> 00:05:04,598
Get 'em!

41
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:20,005
Hands off, tall, dark
and gruesome.

42
00:05:20,099 --> 00:05:22,090
The cat cloak belongs to me.

43
00:05:22,268 --> 00:05:25,022
Actually, it will belong
to the highest bidder...

44
00:05:25,071 --> 00:05:27,977
After I auction it off
to Gotham's criminal elite.

45
00:05:28,007 --> 00:05:32,706
I'd let you bid on it, princess,
but you're about to get put down.

46
00:05:41,054 --> 00:05:42,385
Catwoman!

47
00:05:48,194 --> 00:05:49,855
Oh, terrific.

48
00:05:49,956 --> 00:05:53,260
Because of your little playday,
Two-Face got away with the cloak.

49
00:05:53,299 --> 00:05:56,584
Perhaps I can even things
by helping you track him down.

50
00:05:56,635 --> 00:05:59,329
Not from Blackgate Prison,
you can't, sweetie.

51
00:05:59,371 --> 00:06:03,239
Let's hear her out.
She may be evil, but she <i>is</i> resourceful.

52
00:06:03,409 --> 00:06:06,051
I got a tip about a top secret
underworld summit

53
00:06:06,059 --> 00:06:08,237
happening at the Double-decker Club.

54
00:06:08,254 --> 00:06:11,004
Put two and two together
and you get...

55
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:13,837
Two-Face. That's where
he's holding the auction.

56
00:06:13,886 --> 00:06:16,147
OK. So, what's the plan?

57
00:06:19,015 --> 00:06:20,946
DOUBLE-DECKER CLUB

58
00:06:24,919 --> 00:06:28,403
I still don't get why Batman's letting
her tag along on this mission,

59
00:06:28,415 --> 00:06:31,466
when he's got me.
Uh... <i>Us</i>.

60
00:06:31,804 --> 00:06:33,396
Jealous much...?

61
00:06:44,483 --> 00:06:47,134
Ooh, same dress.
Awkward!

62
00:06:47,186 --> 00:06:50,190
Huntress, don't be silly.
There won't be any problem.

63
00:06:50,222 --> 00:06:51,692
After she changes!

64
00:06:51,757 --> 00:06:55,859
Hardly an option, dear.
Besides, I wear it better.

65
00:06:55,895 --> 00:06:58,474
Kitty, I'm about to put you out
for the night.

66
00:06:58,475 --> 00:07:00,692
Cats eat birds, remember?

67
00:07:07,173 --> 00:07:09,437
Meow...

68
00:07:09,634 --> 00:07:11,226
Listen up.

69
00:07:12,044 --> 00:07:14,919
Everything depends on us
playing our parts perfectly.

70
00:07:14,947 --> 00:07:19,008
From this moment on, I am Matches
Malone, and you are my bodyguards.

71
00:07:19,118 --> 00:07:21,833
Now, let's get this show
on the road.

72
00:07:22,279 --> 00:07:25,180
Anything you say, Boss.

73
00:07:27,426 --> 00:07:30,088
- Hate her.
- Hate her.

74
00:07:52,739 --> 00:07:56,528
You say there's not enough time in one
life to pull all the jobs you want.

75
00:07:56,543 --> 00:07:58,817
What if you had nine lives?

76
00:07:58,991 --> 00:08:03,018
Here it is, folks,
The cloak of Nefertiti.

77
00:08:07,092 --> 00:08:09,617
Bidding starts at 22 mill.

78
00:08:09,926 --> 00:08:13,686
Actually, me and my boys
will take that fancy poncho.

79
00:08:15,074 --> 00:08:17,108
Too bad you didn't keep it
for yourself.

80
00:08:17,243 --> 00:08:20,906
A double cross.
You're a crook after my own heart.

81
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:22,280
Cover me.

82
00:08:38,597 --> 00:08:40,030
Take this, punk!

83
00:08:48,474 --> 00:08:51,204
Touch it and they'll be
calling you "Lefty."

84
00:08:52,645 --> 00:08:55,637
- You all right, Boss?
- Get your mitts off me.

85
00:08:56,815 --> 00:08:59,795
- The day I need a dame's help...
- That's funny...

86
00:08:59,818 --> 00:09:02,513
Considering they are
your bodyguards and all.

87
00:09:02,688 --> 00:09:04,553
These ain't my bodyguards.

88
00:09:05,758 --> 00:09:08,068
They're the stinking Birds of Prey.

89
00:09:08,669 --> 00:09:10,448
Whoops...

90
00:09:18,037 --> 00:09:21,821
Matches is right. It is
the Birds of Prey. Get 'em!

91
00:09:30,082 --> 00:09:32,331
Two double crosses
in one night.

92
00:09:32,354 --> 00:09:35,128
Let's make it three.
I'm taking the cloak.

93
00:09:35,154 --> 00:09:37,666
This room full of Gotham's
most dangerous mobsters

94
00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:40,318
might have something
to say about that.

95
00:09:48,117 --> 00:09:51,730
How would you like to work
for the new top crime boss in Gotham?

96
00:09:51,746 --> 00:09:54,786
I'll match whatever Two-Face
is paying and double it.

97
00:09:54,859 --> 00:09:57,234
Well what are you waiting for?
Rub him out!

98
00:09:58,904 --> 00:10:01,445
We'll join you, Matches.

99
00:10:01,911 --> 00:10:03,287
Argh!

100
00:10:03,288 --> 00:10:04,607
FIRST BANK OF GOTHAM

101
00:10:17,881 --> 00:10:20,627
GOTHAM NEWBIE MAKES
SAP OUT OF TWO-FACE

102
00:10:44,568 --> 00:10:47,137
CITY TERRORIZED BY
'INVINCIBLE' MOB BOSS

103
00:11:10,294 --> 00:11:12,982
TWO-FACE WHO? GOTHAM'S FINEST
HAVE MET THEIR MATCH

104
00:11:33,749 --> 00:11:35,808
MATCHES ON FIRE!

105
00:11:35,809 --> 00:11:37,640
OTHER CRIMINALS
ON THE RUN!

106
00:11:37,799 --> 00:11:41,701
WHERE IS BATMAN?

107
00:11:43,315 --> 00:11:46,148
Where is the bat
when you need him?

108
00:12:05,443 --> 00:12:07,731
Guess it makes sense
Gotham's greatest hero

109
00:12:07,767 --> 00:12:09,812
could also become
its greatest crook.

110
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:13,041
And with him using every criminal's
favorite night spot as his hideout,

111
00:12:13,057 --> 00:12:15,734
it makes it impossible for anyone
to get close to help him.

112
00:12:15,751 --> 00:12:17,981
I bet he'd let me
get close enough.

113
00:12:18,014 --> 00:12:20,611
- I still don't trust you, Cat.
- Look, Miss.

114
00:12:20,643 --> 00:12:24,306
Something that belongs to me is in there.
I don't want it getting ruined.

115
00:12:24,314 --> 00:12:27,544
Are we talking about
the cloak or Batman?

116
00:12:28,014 --> 00:12:30,469
You two are useless.

117
00:12:30,496 --> 00:12:34,711
Oh, yeah?
Well, you are... useless.

118
00:12:35,162 --> 00:12:37,550
Nice comeback there, chief.

119
00:12:39,452 --> 00:12:42,192
NO ADMITTANCE
BACKSTAGE

120
00:12:56,134 --> 00:12:57,812
Whoops...

121
00:13:02,027 --> 00:13:04,246
Oh, big <i>whoops</i>.

122
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:10,562
- Any ideas?
- Just one.

123
00:13:10,650 --> 00:13:12,188
Hit it!

124
00:13:19,601 --> 00:13:22,603
Good evening,
all you, gentlemen,

125
00:13:22,628 --> 00:13:25,077
Mobsters, creeps and crooks.

126
00:13:25,084 --> 00:13:30,065
Men in tights come after you,
and still, you're off the hook.

127
00:13:30,215 --> 00:13:35,593
For those who scare and terrorize,
it’s the dawn of a brand new day,

128
00:13:35,618 --> 00:13:41,807
You scum can just simply call us,
the one and only Birds of Prey.

129
00:13:47,163 --> 00:13:52,322
Green Lantern has his special ring
(Pretty strong, that little thing)

130
00:13:52,347 --> 00:13:54,939
Blue Beetle’s deeds
are really swell,

131
00:13:54,965 --> 00:13:57,872
But who will bring him
out of his shell?

132
00:13:57,897 --> 00:14:02,337
Flash’s foes,
they finish last,

133
00:14:02,353 --> 00:14:07,206
Too bad sometimes
he’s just too fast...

134
00:14:08,262 --> 00:14:13,196
While all the boys
can always save the day,

135
00:14:13,221 --> 00:14:17,783
No one does it better
than the Birds of Prey.

136
00:14:17,791 --> 00:14:19,327
The one and only
Birds of Prey...

137
00:14:19,352 --> 00:14:23,892
While all the boys
can always save the day,

138
00:14:23,917 --> 00:14:26,630
No one does it better,

139
00:14:26,655 --> 00:14:30,973
No one does it better
than the Birds of Prey.

140
00:14:31,529 --> 00:14:36,443
Green Arrow has heroic traits,
that is when he’s shooting straight...

141
00:14:36,475 --> 00:14:38,545
- Hey.
- I'm just sayin'...

142
00:14:38,577 --> 00:14:43,953
Aquaman’s always courageous,
his little fish, less outrageous

143
00:14:43,978 --> 00:14:46,706
Plastic Man can expand,

144
00:14:46,732 --> 00:14:50,053
Becomes putty
in our hands!

145
00:14:50,851 --> 00:14:55,869
While all the boys
can keep you punks at bay,

146
00:14:55,894 --> 00:15:00,116
No one does it better
than the Birds of Prey.

147
00:15:00,141 --> 00:15:01,936
The one and only
Birds of Prey...

148
00:15:01,961 --> 00:15:06,481
While all the boys
can always save the day,

149
00:15:06,506 --> 00:15:09,215
No one does it better,

150
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:14,320
No one does it better
than the Birds of Prey...

151
00:15:21,376 --> 00:15:22,576
Hey!

152
00:15:22,577 --> 00:15:27,891
Batman throws his bat-a-rang,
what a weapon, what a bang.

153
00:15:27,916 --> 00:15:33,207
Check out that utility belt,
sure can make a girl’s heart melt.

154
00:15:33,232 --> 00:15:38,930
He’s always right there for the save,
I’d like to see his secret cave.

155
00:15:38,955 --> 00:15:43,954
While Batman does things
in his special way,

156
00:15:44,142 --> 00:15:49,599
He'd do it better with the Birds of Prey,
The one and only Birds of Prey...

157
00:15:49,612 --> 00:15:54,569
While Batman always seems
to save the day,

158
00:15:54,594 --> 00:15:57,324
No one does it better,

159
00:15:57,349 --> 00:16:03,658
No one does it better
than the Birds of Prey.

160
00:16:04,565 --> 00:16:08,591
Birds of Prey...

161
00:16:08,747 --> 00:16:10,374
Meow.

162
00:16:16,388 --> 00:16:20,103
Bravo. You, sirens,
sure know how to whale.

163
00:16:20,125 --> 00:16:23,617
Too bad this is gonna be
a limited engagement.

164
00:16:23,669 --> 00:16:27,505
- We didn't reach him.
- Then it's time for our next number.

165
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:32,120
Feisty.

166
00:16:40,245 --> 00:16:44,947
You know how I like my birds?
Plucked and caged.

167
00:16:58,997 --> 00:17:03,297
Ladies, you're just in time
for their nightly feeding.

168
00:17:07,172 --> 00:17:08,410
On the bright side,

169
00:17:08,441 --> 00:17:11,894
at least we don't have to hear
Canary sing anymore.

170
00:17:12,744 --> 00:17:14,363
I love you too, dear.

171
00:17:19,518 --> 00:17:21,756
Don't worry,
it's Batman I'm after.

172
00:17:21,772 --> 00:17:25,298
I sent word out all over town that you
three are gonna be chip flavored chump

173
00:17:25,321 --> 00:17:26,604
by the end of the night.

174
00:17:26,613 --> 00:17:28,735
He'll come to rescue you,
I'll whack him

175
00:17:28,758 --> 00:17:32,095
and badaboom badabing,
I'll have complete control of Gotham.

176
00:17:32,130 --> 00:17:36,807
And what happens if Batman doesn't
show up, Mr. Crazy Matches person?

177
00:17:36,868 --> 00:17:40,300
Well, then I guess these sharks
are gonna need some toothpicks.

178
00:17:41,173 --> 00:17:42,373
Lovely.

179
00:17:44,910 --> 00:17:46,571
Matches Malone.

180
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:50,880
You're the... weed of crime,
so...

181
00:17:50,911 --> 00:17:55,717
Prepare to be plucked for...
Twenty years in Iron Heights Prison...

182
00:17:55,848 --> 00:17:57,389
You loser!

183
00:17:57,989 --> 00:17:59,584
- Batman!?
- Batman?!

184
00:18:09,392 --> 00:18:12,335
Wait a minute.
If Matches is Batman...

185
00:18:12,504 --> 00:18:14,529
Then who's the guy
with the blue cape?

186
00:18:16,053 --> 00:18:20,082
Old school fist fighting, Gotham style.
It should be a fair fight.

187
00:18:20,946 --> 00:18:24,677
Fair is good,
but guns are better.

188
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:41,034
- Hey, Cat, can you reach my crossbow?
- Give me something hard to do next time.

189
00:18:45,732 --> 00:18:48,226
Your crossbow's not gonna
do much to that crane.

190
00:18:48,252 --> 00:18:51,278
Then it's a good thing
that's not what I'm aiming for.

191
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:58,080
Nice shot. My turn.

192
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:13,988
Batman don't like guns.
Whoever you are, you ain't him.

193
00:19:22,755 --> 00:19:26,436
We gotta go save the cloak.
I mean, <i>Batman</i>.

194
00:19:26,478 --> 00:19:28,537
Gotta save Batman.

195
00:19:41,793 --> 00:19:46,258
- Two-Face. Figures.
- Truth is, Matches, you did me a favor.

196
00:19:46,364 --> 00:19:48,628
Now that I know
that the cloak actually works...

197
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:50,961
I'll keep it for myself.

198
00:19:54,739 --> 00:19:59,049
And as for guns,
I always carry a couple of spares.

199
00:20:14,693 --> 00:20:18,081
Seven, eight...
Uh, ladies...?

200
00:20:18,139 --> 00:20:22,200
According to the newspapers,
this was his last free life.

201
00:20:24,759 --> 00:20:27,811
Everything was going great
till you, dames, showed up.

202
00:20:27,872 --> 00:20:31,865
You ruined my night.
Now I'm gonna ruin you.

203
00:20:33,511 --> 00:20:36,349
Listen to me,
you are not Matches Malone!

204
00:20:36,377 --> 00:20:37,714
You're...

205
00:20:50,541 --> 00:20:55,054
- I hear cats always land on their feet.
- Urban legend.

206
00:20:55,767 --> 00:20:57,496
<i>Sayonara</i>, kitty.

207
00:20:58,003 --> 00:21:00,904
Wait.
Don't I get a last request?

208
00:21:00,993 --> 00:21:03,885
- What is it?
- This.

209
00:21:17,255 --> 00:21:21,374
- Catwoman, what did you do?
- I knew we couldn't trust this witch.

210
00:21:21,395 --> 00:21:23,978
- She killed Batman!
- Did I...?

211
00:21:36,878 --> 00:21:38,955
At ease, ladies.

212
00:21:39,544 --> 00:21:43,105
But... how?
You already used your last life.

213
00:21:43,281 --> 00:21:47,979
It was Matches Malone's last life.
I absolutely believed that's who I was.

214
00:21:48,019 --> 00:21:53,548
When I landed, Matches died for good,
but Batman is alive and well.

215
00:21:54,259 --> 00:21:57,147
Poor Harvey. Arkham has its ward
cut out for him.

216
00:21:57,228 --> 00:22:00,040
All in all, not a bad mission,
Batman.

217
00:22:00,079 --> 00:22:03,625
You eliminated half the crime
in Gotham, you stopped Two-Face cold...

218
00:22:03,802 --> 00:22:05,394
And you get your life back.

219
00:22:05,429 --> 00:22:09,092
Well, I had a little help.
That was quick thinking, Catwoman.

220
00:22:09,874 --> 00:22:11,074
Catwoman...?

221
00:22:11,776 --> 00:22:15,075
- Look like she's gone, Bats.
- And she took the cloak with her.

222
00:22:15,175 --> 00:22:16,892
So much for redemption...

223
00:22:16,981 --> 00:22:19,745
We'll call this even,
Catwoman.

224
00:22:19,918 --> 00:22:22,037
Until next time.

225
