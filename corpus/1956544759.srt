You told, uh, Detective Owens

308
00:19:49,444 --> 00:19:51,444
your brother recently acted
a little erratic

309
00:19:51,446 --> 00:19:53,980
but you didn't see it
as a big deal.

310
00:19:53,982 --> 00:19:56,383
Well, he forgot an obligation
with my niece,

311
00:19:56,385 --> 00:19:58,119
which wasn't really erratic.

312
00:19:58,121 --> 00:19:59,754

313
00:19:59,756 --> 00:20:02,890

and let it go.

320

maybe if there was some...

incident with the wife...

Uncle Jack, I don't know
what's going on,

363
00:22:43,318 --> 00:22:45,585
but if you don't want
to talk right now...

364
00:22:45,587 --> 00:22:47,555
JACK: No. No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no.

365
00:22:47,557 --> 00:22:49,256
Let-let's talk, yeah.
Uh, we should talk.

366
00:22:49,258 --> 00:22:51,725
Uh... what do you want
to talk about?

367
00:22:51,727 --> 00:22:55,296
I mean, I guess I just wanted
to say thank you, really.

368
00:22:55,298 --> 00:22:57,965
My dad said
you gave him quite a speech

369
00:22:57,967 --> 00:23:00,199
about not picking me up
the other night.

370
00:23:00,201 --> 00:23:03,069
Whatever you said, it really
snapped him into shape.

371
00:23:03,071 --> 00:23:05,238
I know they were just
kissing my butt,

372
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:07,740
but my dad bought me
this new bike

373
00:23:07,742 --> 00:23:10,944
I've been begging for
for, like, 15 years.

374
00:23:10,946 --> 00:23:15,181
Then they took me to Stefano's
for a makeup dinner, of course.

375
00:23:15,183 --> 00:23:18,251
- And believe it or not, I finally...
- Oh, my...

376
00:23:18,253 --> 00:23:20,754
...ordered the garlic
chicken dish thing.

377
00:23:20,756 --> 00:23:22,690
And you weren't wrong.

378
00:23:22,692 --> 00:23:25,726
It was delicious.

379
00:23:25,728 --> 00:23:27,827
But a lot of garlic,
though, right?

380
00:23:27,829 --> 00:23:29,963
- Yeah, super garlicky.
- (sighs quietly)

381
00:23:29,965 --> 00:23:32,199
Actually, after dinner,
we ended up hanging out

382
00:23:32,201 --> 00:23:33,834
and breathing garlic
on each other

383
00:23:33,836 --> 00:23:35,702
(laughing):
until, like, 1:00 a.m.

384
00:23:35,704 --> 00:23:37,337
while we were listening
to some old stuff

385
00:23:37,339 --> 00:23:38,506
from my dad's record collection.

386
00:23:38,508 --> 00:23:41,174
By the way, have you ever
heard of a band called ESG?

387
00:23:41,176 --> 00:23:42,343
- Ash?
- Yeah?

388
00:23:42,345 --> 00:23:43,876
- At Stefano's...
- Mm-hmm.

389
00:23:43,878 --> 00:23:46,246
...uh, the other night,
after dinner,

390
00:23:46,248 --> 00:23:49,248
I bet you had...

391
00:23:49,250 --> 00:23:52,853
a hot fudge sundae
with two cherries on top.

392
00:23:52,855 --> 00:23:54,787
Am I right?

393
00:23:54,789 --> 00:23:55,889
(Ashley chuckles)

394
00:23:55,891 --> 00:23:58,057
Um, uh, what?

395
00:23:58,059 --> 00:24:00,960
Uh, how-how did you know that?

396
00:24:00,962 --> 00:24:04,398
Did you just turn psychic
or something?

397
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,932
<i>What is it?</i>

398
00:24:05,934 --> 00:24:07,834
<i>Do you have a crystal ball?</i>

399
00:24:07,836 --> 00:24:12,072
(dramatically):
<i>Look into his eyes.</i>

400
00:24:12,074 --> 00:24:14,274
<i>He's got ESP.</i>

401
00:24:14,276 --> 00:24:17,745
<i>Jack Radcliff...
fortune-teller detective,</i>

402
00:24:17,747 --> 00:24:21,248
<i>solving cases no one else can.</i>

403
00:24:21,250 --> 00:24:23,150
<i>Supercop.</i>

404
00:24:23,152 --> 00:24:26,819
<i>Seer of hot fudge sundaes.</i>

405
00:24:26,821 --> 00:24:28,322
Ash, you said...

406
00:24:28,324 --> 00:24:29,957
you said you were
at home, right?

407
00:24:29,959 --> 00:24:31,424
ASHLEY (over phone):
Yeah.

408
00:24:31,426 --> 00:24:34,961
Your mom and dad...
they home with you right now?

409
00:24:34,963 --> 00:24:38,164
Mm, no. Um, my mom's at work,
and my dad went out to go

410
00:24:38,166 --> 00:24:40,703
watch some game or something.
I don't know.

411
00:24:42,270 --> 00:24:44,037
Hey, Ash?

412
00:24:44,039 --> 00:24:45,975
Mm-hmm.

413
00:24:47,710 --> 00:24:49,809
I'm about to ask you something

414
00:24:49,811 --> 00:24:51,911
that's gonna make
absolutely no sense,

415
00:24:51,913 --> 00:24:53,846
but do me a favor.

416
00:24:53,848 --> 00:24:57,351
I don't want you to...
I don't want you to ask me why.

417
00:24:57,353 --> 00:25:00,624
Just... just want you
to trust me.

418
00:25:01,790 --> 00:25:03,123
Okay?

419
00:25:03,125 --> 00:25:04,792
(light clinks)

420
00:25:04,794 --> 00:25:06,693
Can you do that for me?

421
00:25:06,695 --> 00:25:08,862
ASHLEY:
I-I mean, I guess so.

422
00:25:08,864 --> 00:25:11,164
Okay, in your dad's shed
out back,

423
00:25:11,166 --> 00:25:14,133
the last time I looked,
there was some spray paint

424
00:25:14,135 --> 00:25:16,172
on his work bench.

425
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:21,107
I want you to go in there,
grab it,

426
00:25:21,109 --> 00:25:23,712
and, um...

427
00:25:26,015 --> 00:25:29,283
I want you to...
spray something on the...

428
00:25:29,285 --> 00:25:31,451
on the doors of the shed.

429
00:25:31,453 --> 00:25:33,219
ASHLEY:
Like what?

430
00:25:33,221 --> 00:25:35,189
Paint a... paint a big red "X."

431
00:25:35,191 --> 00:25:36,923
A big red "X"?

432
00:25:36,925 --> 00:25:39,325
A big...

433
00:25:39,327 --> 00:25:41,461
fat red "X."

434
00:25:41,463 --> 00:25:44,064
Okay?

435
00:25:44,066 --> 00:25:46,132
(sighs): Uh, okay. I'll call
you back when it's done.

436
00:25:46,134 --> 00:25:47,500
No. Wait. Wait.
Well, you-you don't have

437
00:25:47,502 --> 00:25:49,036
- to get off.
- Later, alligator.

438
00:25:49,038 --> 00:25:51,104

Hang on. Hang on.
There's something

- I need to ask.
- Okay.

453
00:27:33,275 --> 00:27:35,142
For some reason,
my... my phone's acting up,

454
00:27:35,144 --> 00:27:36,442
not showing a date.

455
00:27:36,444 --> 00:27:38,144
Can you look at your phone

456
00:27:38,146 --> 00:27:39,846
and-and tell me what it is?

457
00:27:39,848 --> 00:27:41,047
Uh, okay.

458
00:27:41,049 --> 00:27:44,918
Um, all right, so it's, uh...

459
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:46,855
J-June 25.

460
00:27:49,325 --> 00:27:51,557
You said it's June 25 today?

461
00:27:51,559 --> 00:27:53,594
ASHLEY:
Yes, but listen,

462
00:27:53,596 --> 00:27:55,362
I-I did
what your weird butt asked,

463
00:27:55,364 --> 00:27:57,497
but unbelievably,
while I was in here

464
00:27:57,499 --> 00:27:59,632
doing the deed,
my dad pulled in the driveway

465
00:27:59,634 --> 00:28:01,301
- in some weird white car,
- (gasps)

466
00:28:01,303 --> 00:28:03,370
- and now I'm trapped.
- What you... what you...?

467
00:28:03,372 --> 00:28:05,171
What you mean,
a weird white car?

468
00:28:05,173 --> 00:28:07,908
Just some weird white car
pulled up in the driveway,

469
00:28:07,910 --> 00:28:10,009
so I freaked out
and pulled the doors closed.

470
00:28:10,011 --> 00:28:11,612
You pulled the door?

471
00:28:11,614 --> 00:28:13,580
Okay, uh...

472
00:28:13,582 --> 00:28:15,114
was your dad driving it?

473
00:28:15,116 --> 00:28:17,383
No. He's in the passenger side.

474
00:28:17,385 --> 00:28:19,052
You recognize the driver?

475
00:28:19,054 --> 00:28:21,622
No. I-I...
No, I can't really see.

476
00:28:21,624 --> 00:28:24,524
Ashley, if you can, I want you
to carefully peek out

477
00:28:24,526 --> 00:28:26,927
and see if you can read
the license plate

478
00:28:26,929 --> 00:28:29,563
or-or get a good look
at the guy behind the wheel.

479
00:28:29,565 --> 00:28:31,134
Can you do that?

480
00:28:36,471 --> 00:28:38,171
Ashley, where'd you go?

481
00:28:38,173 --> 00:28:40,340
ASHLEY:
Shh. Hang on. I'm looking.

482
00:28:40,342 --> 00:28:42,278
(car engine idling)

483
00:28:44,346 --> 00:28:47,247
ASHLEY:
S-So, unfortunately, no.

484
00:28:47,249 --> 00:28:49,082
I-I can't see the plates.

485
00:28:49,084 --> 00:28:51,051
(over phone): 'Cause of
the way the car is parked.

486
00:28:51,053 --> 00:28:53,353
Uh... what kind of car is it?

487
00:28:53,355 --> 00:28:55,288
It looks old. I...

488
00:28:55,290 --> 00:28:58,190
I'm not quite sure what it is.

489
00:28:58,192 --> 00:28:59,692
It's a sports car.

490
00:28:59,694 --> 00:29:01,460
It's a sports car with...

491
00:29:01,462 --> 00:29:03,229
big lights, like frog eyes.

492
00:29:03,231 --> 00:29:05,364
JACK (over phone):
Uh, Ashley, I...

493
00:29:05,366 --> 00:29:08,401
I need you
to be very, very specific.

494
00:29:08,403 --> 00:29:10,202
Look closely.

495
00:29:10,204 --> 00:29:11,571
- Maybe...
- (engine revving)

496
00:29:11,573 --> 00:29:13,306
you can see an emblem
or something?

497
00:29:13,308 --> 00:29:15,676
ASHLEY:
Yeah, there was. A-A tiny one.

498
00:29:15,678 --> 00:29:17,611
But the car just drove away.

499
00:29:17,613 --> 00:29:20,247
- With or without your dad?
- With him.

500
00:29:20,249 --> 00:29:21,648
That's good.
You can come out.

501
00:29:21,650 --> 00:29:23,182
Yeah, I know.

502
00:29:23,184 --> 00:29:24,551
I'm already out.

503
00:29:24,553 --> 00:29:26,652
Okay, so confess.

504
00:29:26,654 --> 00:29:29,925
Why in the world did you just
have me do that?

505
00:29:31,460 --> 00:29:33,395
Hello?

506
00:29:36,498 --> 00:29:38,468
Ashley, I need you to think.

507
00:29:40,269 --> 00:29:42,635
Think about what?

508
00:29:42,637 --> 00:29:45,706
About if anything unusual's
been going on,

509
00:29:45,708 --> 00:29:47,673
like the thing
with the white car.

510
00:29:47,675 --> 00:29:50,043
You know, new people.

511
00:29:50,045 --> 00:29:51,978
Conversation you overheard
that seemed strange.

512
00:29:51,980 --> 00:29:54,347
Maybe... maybe something
having to do with your mom?

513
00:29:54,349 --> 00:29:57,351
Maybe they had a big fight
recently, or...

514
00:29:57,353 --> 00:30:00,253
maybe you noticed your dad
seemed to have stopped

515
00:30:00,255 --> 00:30:02,255
taking his medications.

516
00:30:02,257 --> 00:30:03,623
I-I don't understand.

517
00:30:03,625 --> 00:30:05,491
Why are you even asking?

518
00:30:05,493 --> 00:30:08,495
JACK: The truth is,
all this is about a case,

519
00:30:08,497 --> 00:30:10,063
but it's not an ordinary case.

520
00:30:10,065 --> 00:30:11,698
It's a case to do with your dad.

521
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:14,700
ASHLEY: A case?
Well, what kind of case?

522
00:30:14,702 --> 00:30:17,437
JACK: It could be he's gotten
into some of the same stuff

523
00:30:17,439 --> 00:30:19,605
that got him in trouble
when you were little.

524
00:30:19,607 --> 00:30:22,676
And if that's true,
we have got to protect him.

525
00:30:22,678 --> 00:30:24,777
ASHLEY: You're saying
he's doing it again?

526
00:30:24,779 --> 00:30:26,712
He-he's dealing drugs again?

527
00:30:26,714 --> 00:30:29,716
JACK:
It's possible, yes.

528
00:30:29,718 --> 00:30:31,718
ASHLEY:
Well, I mean,

529
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:36,055
if-if he's off his medications,
he really doesn't seem like it.

530
00:30:36,057 --> 00:30:38,758
He seems good, and to answer
your other question,

531
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:41,260
him and my mom
haven't been fighting at all,

532
00:30:41,262 --> 00:30:43,196
at least from what I've seen.

533
00:30:43,198 --> 00:30:45,498
They've actually been
very sweet and cuddly

534
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:46,699
(laughing):
with each other lately.

535
00:30:46,701 --> 00:30:48,334
They seem really good.

536
00:30:48,336 --> 00:30:52,738
And if I really think about it,
especially my dad.

537
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:54,274
He's been in a good mood,

538
00:30:54,276 --> 00:30:56,476
and he's been getting back
into his music.

539
00:30:56,478 --> 00:30:59,613
Actually, he's been writing
this really beautiful new song.

540
00:30:59,615 --> 00:31:01,748
I don't think it's gonna be
a hit or anything,

541
00:31:01,750 --> 00:31:03,283
but it's really pretty.

542
00:31:03,285 --> 00:31:05,552
I guess I'm saying I-I just...

543
00:31:05,554 --> 00:31:07,821
think he's doing good
when he's playing his music.

544
00:31:07,823 --> 00:31:10,056
Usually, if he's depressed
or off his meds,

545
00:31:10,058 --> 00:31:12,191
he's just... kind of quits.

546
00:31:12,193 --> 00:31:13,826
- Hey, Ash.
- Uh-huh.

547

the name "Georgie" before?

548
00:31:18,666 --> 00:31:21,634
I don't think so.

549
00:31:21,636 --> 00:31:23,569
Why?

550
00:31:23,571 --> 00:31:25,572
Who's Georgie?

551
00:31:25,574 --> 00:31:27,373
I don't know.

just back to my room.

555
00:31:38,686 --> 00:31:40,622

556
00:31:43,592 --> 00:31:46,226

Hey, Ash?

ASHLEY:
Yeah.

561
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:07,150
Did you just get
your room repainted?

562
00:32:08,383 --> 00:32:10,283
Sor-Sorry. H-How...?

563
00:32:10,285 --> 00:32:12,321
How in the heck
do you know that?

564
00:32:15,857 --> 00:32:19,392
Uncle Jack,
how do you know that?!

565
00:32:19,394 --> 00:32:21,694
'Cause I was looking
at your dad's credit report

566
00:32:21,696 --> 00:32:23,296
'cause of the case.

567
00:32:23,298 --> 00:32:26,866
I saw a receipt
for, uh... for paint.

568
00:32:26,868 --> 00:32:29,803
Right. Okay. I mean, yeah.

569
00:32:29,805 --> 00:32:32,506
He repainted it a few days ago.

570
00:32:32,508 --> 00:32:34,507
I guess as part
of kissing my butt

571
00:32:34,509 --> 00:32:36,343
for screwing up the other night.

572
00:32:36,345 --> 00:32:38,178
He did the whole thing himself.

573
00:32:38,180 --> 00:32:40,313
Which was nice
but slightly annoying,

574
00:32:40,315 --> 00:32:42,882
because you know how
when painters paint

575
00:32:42,884 --> 00:32:44,750
and they do a sloppy job

576
00:32:44,752 --> 00:32:46,853
and they accidentally
seal up the cracks?

577
00:32:46,855 --> 00:32:48,822
- JACK: Uh-huh.
- Well, that's what happened,

578
00:32:48,824 --> 00:32:50,690
and now my window's stuck.

579
00:32:50,692 --> 00:32:52,659
Your window's stuck?

580
00:32:52,661 --> 00:32:54,661
Yeah, it's totally sealed shut.

581
00:32:54,663 --> 00:32:57,296
I don't think I can open it
without a crowbar.

582
00:32:57,298 --> 00:33:00,600
But what are we doing
talking about my window?

583
00:33:00,602 --> 00:33:03,769
Ugh. It's too bad I don't
know his e-mail password

584
00:33:03,771 --> 00:33:06,672
so I could check and see
if there's a Georgie...

585
00:33:06,674 --> 00:33:08,674
or...

586
00:33:08,676 --> 00:33:11,378
You know what?
One thing I could maybe do...

587
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:13,846
I could Google the bug-eyed car
and try to figure out

588
00:33:13,848 --> 00:33:15,681
what kind it is.

589
00:33:15,683 --> 00:33:18,418
Or, I mean, if-if it comes back,

590
00:33:18,420 --> 00:33:19,853
I-I could go outside

591
00:33:19,855 --> 00:33:21,955
and see if there's plates
on the rear.

592
00:33:21,957 --> 00:33:24,490
But, of course, who knows
if that'll ever happen?

593
00:33:24,492 --> 00:33:26,293

- Uh-oh. Crap.

594
00:33:26,295 --> 00:33:27,661

- Okay, uh,

595
00:33:27,663 --> 00:33:29,595

- Is that Wilco?

596
00:33:29,597 --> 00:33:30,729
Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's Wilco.

597

598
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:34,334
I think my dad is just
walking in the door,

599

and I've got red paint
all over my hands,

600
00:33:36,238 --> 00:33:38,470
so I got to wash up
before he comes in. Uh...

- Wow.

Hey, Ashley.

Hey, so you know the name
you gave me... "Georgie"?

When my dad wasn't looking,

718
00:40:31,119 --> 00:40:33,686
I think I found something
in his old day planner.

719
00:40:33,688 --> 00:40:35,021
Found what?

720
00:40:35,023 --> 00:40:36,755

- No.

721
00:40:36,757 --> 00:40:38,257
I couldn't find his last name.

722
00:40:38,259 --> 00:40:40,360
But I think I found his address.

723
00:40:40,362 --> 00:40:42,028
That's incredible.

724
00:40:42,030 --> 00:40:43,896

- Okay, give it to me.

725
00:40:43,898 --> 00:40:46,398

- What...?

726

"in just a minute"?

732

because all your lights are on,

733
00:41:03,351 --> 00:41:05,651

- No!

734
00:41:05,653 --> 00:41:07,320
- Wha...?
- No, Ashley,

735
00:41:07,322 --> 00:41:11,157
I need... I need you
to turn around and go. Okay?

736

Oh, I mean, okay, I heard you,

Okay, get the hell out of there.

1063
01:00:18,972 --> 01:00:21,139
But whatever you do,
do not go home.

1064
01:00:21,141 --> 01:00:23,141
Uncle Jack, there's-there's
people here. There's a car.

1065
01:00:23,143 --> 01:00:25,376
- Hello?
- What people? What car?

1066
01:00:25,378 --> 01:00:28,512

- Th-There-there... Hello?

1067

I'll be right over.

But before I get there,
we need to focus.

1115
01:04:15,509 --> 01:04:17,275
The guys who beat up your dad,

1116
01:04:17,277 --> 01:04:19,244
was there anything else you saw?

1117
01:04:19,246 --> 01:04:21,579
- What about their cars?
- Uh, uh, yeah, uh...

1118
01:04:21,581 --> 01:04:23,081
I thought about that, too.

1119
01:04:23,083 --> 01:04:24,581
There-there was a hat.
Um...

1120
01:04:24,583 --> 01:04:26,316
a yellow one, and...

1121
01:04:26,318 --> 01:04:28,420
I-I had their license plates
written down

1122
01:04:28,422 --> 01:04:30,155
- on a napkin.
- That's great.

1123
01:04:30,157 --> 01:04:32,157
- That's great.
- Yeah, but it was in my backpack,

1124
01:04:32,159 --> 01:04:34,224
and I lost my backpack
while I was running away.

1125
01:04:34,226 --> 01:04:35,427
JACK:
Wait, wait.

1126
01:04:35,429 --> 01:04:37,461
You just say
you lost your backpack?

1127
01:04:37,463 --> 01:04:41,099
ASHLEY:
Yeah. Wh-Why?

1128
01:04:41,101 --> 01:04:44,605
Ashley, you-you have any i-idea
why your backpack would be wet?

1129
01:04:45,704 --> 01:04:47,704
How do you know that?

1130
01:04:47,706 --> 01:04:49,706
JACK: I'll tell you
right after you answer.

1131
01:04:49,708 --> 01:04:51,543
Okay? I promise.
Just tell me.

1132
01:04:51,545 --> 01:04:54,144
ASHLEY: Okay, um,
this man came running after me,

1133
01:04:54,146 --> 01:04:55,345
and I fell in the river.

1134
01:04:55,347 --> 01:04:56,548
Everything falls in the river.

1135
01:04:56,550 --> 01:04:58,083
My backpack, my bike.

1136
01:04:58,085 --> 01:05:00,784
And I-I didn't have time
to get my backpack.

1137
01:05:00,786 --> 01:05:02,722
- I didn't have time.
- (door opens)

1138
01:05:04,090 --> 01:05:05,557
So I just... I ran.

1139
01:05:05,559 --> 01:05:07,559
And I lost my backpack.

1140
01:05:07,561 --> 01:05:09,494
And then I ca... I called you.

1141
01:05:09,496 --> 01:05:11,563
JACK:
Ash.

1142
01:05:11,565 --> 01:05:15,566
Ash, I know I've asked you
to do a lot of weird stuff.

1143
01:05:15,568 --> 01:05:17,367
I know you want me to stop.

1144
01:05:17,369 --> 01:05:19,704
But I do have
one more thing like that

1145
01:05:19,706 --> 01:05:21,305
to ask, and then that's it.

1146
01:05:21,307 --> 01:05:23,307
Everything will start...
(pained): making sense.

1147
01:05:23,309 --> 01:05:24,842

1148
01:05:24,844 --> 01:05:26,443

- (groans)

1149
01:05:26,445 --> 01:05:27,512

(grunts, panting)

1151
01:05:34,588 --> 01:05:36,454
By the register,

1152
01:05:36,456 --> 01:05:39,456
you know where there's a bunch
of bubble gum in a... in a jar?

1153
01:05:39,458 --> 01:05:41,258
(Jack panting)

1154
01:05:41,260 --> 01:05:42,392
- Yeah.
- Okay.

1155
01:05:42,394 --> 01:05:44,595
I want you to grab a handful.

1156
01:05:44,597 --> 01:05:45,796
All different colors.

1157
01:05:45,798 --> 01:05:48,166
And then tell me
when that's done.

1158
01:05:48,168 --> 01:05:49,833
Uncle Jack,
are you here somewhere?

1159
01:05:49,835 --> 01:05:52,637
The answer to all your questions
is in that jar of bubble gum.

1160
01:05:52,639 --> 01:05:54,572
Just reach in there, and then...

1161
01:05:54,574 --> 01:05:56,374
then go to our booth,

1162
01:05:56,376 --> 01:05:58,443
the one we always sit in.

1163
01:05:58,445 --> 01:05:59,380
Okay.

1164
01:06:00,447 --> 01:06:01,445
Okay.

1165
01:06:01,447 --> 01:06:02,750
(sighs)

1166
01:06:04,483 --> 01:06:05,550
(Jack sighs)

1167
01:06:05,552 --> 01:06:07,684
You with me, Ash?

1168
01:06:07,686 --> 01:06:09,354
ASHLEY:
Yeah, okay.

1169
01:06:09,356 --> 01:06:10,688
Uh, now what?

1170
01:06:10,690 --> 01:06:12,856
Okay. So, uh...

1171
01:06:12,858 --> 01:06:14,291
here's what we're gonna do.

1172
01:06:14,293 --> 01:06:17,195
I want you to pick
a piece of gum.

1173
01:06:17,197 --> 01:06:18,496
Any color.

1174
01:06:18,498 --> 01:06:20,565
Okay? Now start chewing it.

1175
01:06:20,567 --> 01:06:22,934
- Okay.
- (Jack panting)

1176
01:06:22,936 --> 01:06:25,235
And when it's good and goopy,

1177
01:06:25,237 --> 01:06:28,673
um, I want you to stick it
under the table

1178
01:06:28,675 --> 01:06:31,778
real good so it won't fall off.

1179
01:06:33,746 --> 01:06:35,612
All right.

1180
01:06:35,614 --> 01:06:37,750
It's done.

1181
01:06:41,922 --> 01:06:43,588
(Jack grunts softly)

1182
01:06:43,590 --> 01:06:45,322
(panting)

1183
01:06:45,324 --> 01:06:46,724
Huh.

1184
01:06:46,726 --> 01:06:48,896
(panting):
Red gum.

1185
01:06:50,896 --> 01:06:53,630
You were chewing red gum.

1186
01:06:53,632 --> 01:06:55,435
(panting)

1187
01:06:58,204 --> 01:07:00,271
I-I-I don't under...
I don't...

1188
01:07:00,273 --> 01:07:01,271
I don't understand.

1189
01:07:01,273 --> 01:07:03,208
How-how did you...?

1190
01:07:03,210 --> 01:07:05,376
How do I know things
I shouldn't?

1191
01:07:05,378 --> 01:07:08,479
Why did I get you
to paint the red "X"?

1192
01:07:08,481 --> 01:07:13,418
What are we doing
sticking things under the table?

1193
01:07:13,420 --> 01:07:14,885
The fact is,

1194
01:07:14,887 --> 01:07:16,887
believe it or not,

1195
01:07:16,889 --> 01:07:19,423
I'm sitting right here,

1196
01:07:19,425 --> 01:07:22,427
holding a dried-up,
chewed-up piece of red gum

1197
01:07:22,429 --> 01:07:25,396
you just stuck under the table.

1198
01:07:25,398 --> 01:07:28,398
But for me, it's two weeks old.

1199
01:07:28,400 --> 01:07:30,901
I'm telling you, I'm sitting
in the booth you're sitting at

1200
01:07:30,903 --> 01:07:33,371
two weeks...

1201
01:07:33,373 --> 01:07:35,974
two weeks in the future.

1202
01:07:35,976 --> 01:07:38,512
(shuddering inhale)

1203
01:07:43,583 --> 01:07:45,749
Ash, where'd you go?

1204
01:07:45,751 --> 01:07:47,820
Just-just a second.

1205
01:07:49,422 --> 01:07:50,688
- Ash.
- (stammers)

1206
01:07:50,690 --> 01:07:52,826
Just a second.

1207
01:07:56,730 --> 01:07:58,465
(paper ripping)

1208
01:08:03,335 --> 01:08:04,802
(grunts)

1209
01:08:04,804 --> 01:08:07,338
Okay. Look again

1210
01:08:07,340 --> 01:08:09,610
and tell me what you see.

1211
01:08:13,612 --> 01:08:15,882
(panting)

1212
01:08:20,819 --> 01:08:24,821
You put a red question mark,
written in crayon there,

1213
01:08:24,823 --> 01:08:28,428
with the yellow piece
of bubble gum.

1214
01:08:33,332 --> 01:08:35,767
Ashley...

1215
01:08:35,769 --> 01:08:38,303
I know your backpack was wet,

1216
01:08:38,305 --> 01:08:39,970
because...

1217
01:08:39,972 --> 01:08:42,706
somehow, it ended up...

1218
01:08:42,708 --> 01:08:45,442
(exhales)

1219
01:08:45,444 --> 01:08:48,845
(sighs)
In your future,

1220
01:08:48,847 --> 01:08:53,817
the one I'm in right now,
it-it ended up...

1221
01:08:53,819 --> 01:08:57,357
at a crime scene we've been
investigating, soaked.

1222
01:08:58,891 --> 01:09:02,059
A crime that, in your time,
hasn't yet happened.

1223
01:09:02,061 --> 01:09:03,760
I'm...

1224
01:09:03,762 --> 01:09:05,963
I'm telling you, unless you do
something about it,

1225
01:09:05,965 --> 01:09:09,000
it's not just your dad
who's gonna die.

1226
01:09:09,002 --> 01:09:12,602
Your mom's gonna die.

1227
01:09:12,604 --> 01:09:14,871
And so are you.

1228
01:09:14,873 --> 01:09:17,344
(Jack panting)

1229
01:09:22,881 --> 01:09:23,880
Wh...

1230
01:09:23,882 --> 01:09:25,616
(exhales)

1231
01:09:25,618 --> 01:09:27,485
(inhales, exhales)

1232
01:09:27,487 --> 01:09:30,420
Which you know because...

1233
01:09:30,422 --> 01:09:32,960
you're my time-traveling uncle
from the future?

1234
01:09:36,395 --> 01:09:38,129
(chuckling)

1235
01:09:38,131 --> 01:09:40,067
Yeah.

1236
01:09:41,900 --> 01:09:45,969

1239
01:09:49,074 --> 01:09:51,875
Ashley, that's not important.

1240
01:09:51,877 --> 01:09:53,945
How is it not important?

1241
01:09:53,947 --> 01:09:55,679
Because it's not gonna happen.

1242
01:09:55,681 --> 01:09:58,014
- B-Because you're gonna save yourself.
- How do I die?

1243
01:09:58,016 --> 01:09:59,650
You're gonna erase all this.

1244
01:09:59,652 --> 01:10:00,651
Tell me right now!

1245
01:10:00,653 --> 01:10:01,818

I'm not gonna let that happen.

1249
01:10:08,494 --> 01:10:11,595
You're gonna get on a bus
or-or a train

1250
01:10:11,597 --> 01:10:14,965
or ride your bike and sleep
o-on a beach if you have to.

1251

We don't know that yet.

01:10:27,680 --> 01:10:29,045
Okay. Just...

01:10:29,047 --> 01:10:31,452

1268

and you died right on your bed.

1269
01:11:00,880 --> 01:11:03,880
(sighs) It looked like
maybe you tried to...

1270
01:11:03,882 --> 01:11:06,116
force open your window
to get away,

1271
01:11:06,118 --> 01:11:09,922

made it stick.

Yeah.

1274
01:11:16,496 --> 01:11:20,697
But as long as you're alive,
you can change this.

Jack, come on, man.

(horn honking)

1414
01:19:01,927 --> 01:19:04,260
- What's up, Ash?
- Hey, Bobby.

1415
01:19:04,262 --> 01:19:06,930
All right, let me get this.
I got this.

1416
01:19:06,932 --> 01:19:09,333
ASHLEY:
Thanks for getting here so fast.

1417
01:19:09,335 --> 01:19:12,068
BOBBY: Of course.
You call me, I'm there.

1418
01:19:12,070 --> 01:19:15,371
BOBBY: <i>So, exactly
what's going on, huh?</i>

1419
01:19:15,373 --> 01:19:18,075
ASHLEY: <i>Like I
said on the phone, I-I...</i>

1420
01:19:18,077 --> 01:19:20,210
<i>I just have a feeling
it would be a good thing</i>

1421
01:19:20,212 --> 01:19:21,611
<i>if you came over.</i>

1422
01:19:21,613 --> 01:19:24,080
BOBBY:
<i>Is-is it your dad?</i>

1423
01:19:24,082 --> 01:19:25,616
Is he drinking?

1424
01:19:25,618 --> 01:19:27,284
Is he...

1425
01:19:27,286 --> 01:19:29,018
is he doing drugs again?

1426
01:19:29,020 --> 01:19:30,353
Is he...

1427
01:19:30,355 --> 01:19:32,893
Y-You want to talk about it?

1428
01:19:33,993 --> 01:19:35,992
- No.
- No?

1429
01:19:35,994 --> 01:19:38,128
No.

1430
01:19:38,130 --> 01:19:41,531
It's just good that
you-you came and picked me up.

1431
01:19:41,533 --> 01:19:43,400
Yeah, well...

1432
01:19:43,402 --> 01:19:46,402
well, you know I got you.

1433
01:19:46,404 --> 01:19:48,738
Do you mind
if I charge my phone?

1434
01:19:48,740 --> 01:19:50,473
(chuckles):
Hey.

1435
01:19:50,475 --> 01:19:52,978
Help yourself.

1436
01:19:58,083 --> 01:20:01,085
Sir, one thing
you haven't said yet

1437
01:20:01,087 --> 01:20:04,754
is how exactly my brother
was involved in all of this.

1438
01:20:04,756 --> 01:20:06,022
Do we know?

1439
01:20:06,024 --> 01:20:07,324
Well, for a few years now...

1440
01:20:07,326 --> 01:20:08,592
well, you probably know this
already...

1441
01:20:08,594 --> 01:20:11,461
your brother reverted back to
his old ways to pay the bills.

1442
01:20:11,463 --> 01:20:14,031
Unfortunately, it got him
caught up in a transaction

1443
01:20:14,033 --> 01:20:16,032
with an out-of-town associate
of Georgie's...

1444
01:20:16,034 --> 01:20:19,068
(chuckles) who had no idea
he was selling evidence

1445
01:20:19,070 --> 01:20:20,573
to the brother of a cop.

1446
01:20:23,109 --> 01:20:26,710
Well, you can imagine,
those beans get spilled,

1447
01:20:26,712 --> 01:20:29,713
tightknit group of cops
on the make,

1448
01:20:29,715 --> 01:20:31,382
fragile trust,

1449
01:20:31,384 --> 01:20:33,650
their cover blown
by the ne'er-do-well brother

1450
01:20:33,652 --> 01:20:36,452
of the oh-so-honest
Jack Radcliff,

1451
01:20:36,454 --> 01:20:38,187
people get uptight.

1452
01:20:38,189 --> 01:20:41,527
They start thinking they've got
to shoot their way out.

1453
01:20:54,774 --> 01:20:56,773
JACK:
So, where does this lead to?

1454
01:20:56,775 --> 01:21:00,443
Into the Olympic Forest on
the backside of Kenneth Hahn.

1455
01:21:00,445 --> 01:21:02,111
You ever been there before?

1456
01:21:02,113 --> 01:21:03,613
(clanging, creaking)

1457
01:21:03,615 --> 01:21:05,415
JACK:
Yeah, but...

1458
01:21:05,417 --> 01:21:07,584
not through here.

1459
01:21:07,586 --> 01:21:09,452
You'll like it.

1460
01:21:09,454 --> 01:21:10,457
Nice.

Ah, we wait around here anymore,

Point that fucking gun

truth is, I think
my parents are in

called your Uncle Jack to...

1511

Um... I-I don't know.

this time.

I was hoping we could all

1527
01:24:34,359 --> 01:24:36,259
go inside and talk,
if that's okay.

1528
01:24:36,261 --> 01:24:37,593
I just have a few questions

1529
01:24:37,595 --> 01:24:39,528
I'd like to ask
everybody concerned.

1530
01:24:39,530 --> 01:24:41,964
Like... how in the world

1531
01:24:41,966 --> 01:24:45,768
did your daughter end up
following you...

1532
01:24:45,770 --> 01:24:47,706
to Amherst Street today?

1533
01:24:49,507 --> 01:24:51,275

No, Bobby. No.

You run, you scream,

1536
01:24:55,314 --> 01:24:57,984
I will blow your daddy's head
off his neck.

You don't have ESP,
