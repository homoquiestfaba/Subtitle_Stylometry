1
00:00:09,943 --> 00:00:11,535
Hey, Jay?

2
00:00:18,718 --> 00:00:20,049
Jay!

3
00:00:21,254 --> 00:00:26,021
Could you hand me the shower gel
that's on the counter there? Thank you.

4
00:00:28,361 --> 00:00:29,555
Jay?

5
00:00:33,233 --> 00:00:34,359
Baby?

6
00:00:41,307 --> 00:00:42,467
Jay!

7
00:00:44,344 --> 00:00:45,368
I was thinking we could

8
00:00:45,478 --> 00:00:47,446
- go to the Mexico Grill for dinner.
- Frick, my poster!

9
00:00:50,483 --> 00:00:51,882
- "Dear Rachel... "
- "Dear Cindy... "

10
00:00:51,985 --> 00:00:53,714
- "Dear Velma... "
- "Lisa... "

11
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:55,185
- "Christy... "
- "Dear Monica... "

12
00:00:55,288 --> 00:00:57,222
- "Dear Erin... "
- "Dear Tammy... "

13
00:00:58,525 --> 00:01:00,891
"I'm sorry to do it this way... "

14
00:01:00,994 --> 00:01:02,985
- "... but I figured it'd be easier on... "
- "... both of us?"

15
00:01:05,398 --> 00:01:08,128
- "Things aren't working out... "
- "... and I think we both know that. "

16
00:01:08,234 --> 00:01:11,032
"I've tried to come up with
a way to make this work... "

17
00:01:11,137 --> 00:01:14,595
- "... but I think history... "
- "... or circumstance... "

18
00:01:14,707 --> 00:01:18,108
"... or whatever has caught up with us... "

19
00:01:36,162 --> 00:01:39,495
"Most couples facing what we've had to face
never even make it this far. "

20
00:01:43,002 --> 00:01:44,560
"My only hope is that in the future,

21
00:01:44,671 --> 00:01:46,104
- "the world might... "
- "... the world might change?"

22
00:01:46,206 --> 00:01:48,470
- "... so that a relationship like ours... "
- "... like ours

23
00:01:48,575 --> 00:01:50,941
"might stand a fighting chance. "

24
00:01:54,047 --> 00:01:56,811
Jay! Jay?

25
00:01:57,851 --> 00:01:59,318
Jay.

26
00:02:11,631 --> 00:02:14,964
"You deserved better than this, I know... "

27
00:02:15,435 --> 00:02:16,959
- "But more so... "
- "... you deserve better... "

28
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:18,560
"... than me. "

29
00:02:31,584 --> 00:02:33,745
"Please accept my apology. "

30
00:02:33,853 --> 00:02:35,787
"Please accept my apology. "

31
00:02:35,889 --> 00:02:38,119
"Please accept my apology. "

32
00:02:38,224 --> 00:02:40,522
- "Always, Jay. "
- "Jay. "

33
00:02:40,627 --> 00:02:41,719
- "Jay. "
- "Jay. "

34
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:43,227
- "Jay. "
- "Jay. "

35
00:02:43,363 --> 00:02:44,523
Oh! My god!

36
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:51,837
"Always, Jay. "

37
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:58,474
Jay, you coward!
What the fuck is this about, huh?

38
00:03:14,994 --> 00:03:16,723
Dude, you've gotta stop doing this.

39
00:03:16,829 --> 00:03:19,263
This one's so not my fault.
Okay, check this out.

40
00:03:19,365 --> 00:03:22,027
Do I look anything like Gary Coleman?

41
00:03:22,635 --> 00:03:23,624
Uh...

42
00:03:23,736 --> 00:03:25,363
She said that?

43
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:30,535
<i>Take the good, you take the bad
You take them both and then you have</i>

44
00:03:30,643 --> 00:03:32,543
The wrong show, asshole.

45
00:03:33,246 --> 00:03:34,213
Yeah.

46
00:03:34,547 --> 00:03:35,946
Thanks for picking me up.

47
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:38,547
No problem.

48
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:45,279
Jay.

49
00:03:47,093 --> 00:03:49,027
Dude, are you gonna get that?

50
00:03:49,128 --> 00:03:51,460
Nope. She's probably still in stage one.

51
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:54,032
What, the "rip off your head
and piss down your neck" stage?

52
00:03:54,133 --> 00:03:56,397
- Stage one.
- Oh, yes! Dude!

53
00:03:57,670 --> 00:03:59,604
You got work lined up yet?

54
00:03:59,706 --> 00:04:01,936
No. No, I figured, you know,
as long as the temp agencies

55
00:04:03,109 --> 00:04:06,044
Are mainly looking for qualified, you know,
and highly-motivated type individuals,

56
00:04:06,145 --> 00:04:08,079
I might as well just enjoy
my hiatus from the job market.

57
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:11,945
Dude, it's been over a year.
How long does unemployment last?

58
00:04:12,285 --> 00:04:13,912
PlayStation?

59
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:17,387
Can't. As fate would have it,
I've got to work tomorrow.

60
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:19,157
Oh, okay. Hey, Jay?

61
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:20,556
- Yeah.
- PlayStation?

62
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:21,684
Okay.

63
00:04:22,795 --> 00:04:23,853
All right.

64
00:04:26,633 --> 00:04:28,931
- You can't...
- Yes, I can. And you can't...

65
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:31,130
- You gonna get that?
- Nope.

66
00:04:33,873 --> 00:04:34,862
Jay!

67
00:04:37,543 --> 00:04:39,135
- There.
- Thank you.

68
00:04:59,098 --> 00:05:01,464
<i>You have 25 new messages.</i>

69
00:05:02,001 --> 00:05:06,267
<i>Message one,
received at 10:32 p. m., yesterday.</i>

70
00:05:06,939 --> 00:05:09,430
<i>Did you just break up with me?</i>

71
00:05:09,542 --> 00:05:13,911
<i>Message nine,
received at 11:44 p. m., yesterday.</i>

72
00:05:14,447 --> 00:05:17,814
<i>I'm not angry anymore.
I'm confused, but not angry.</i>

73
00:05:18,384 --> 00:05:20,147
<i>You're not worth my time, Jay.</i>

74
00:05:20,253 --> 00:05:23,188
<i>But I'm going to take the high road,
'cause that's...</i>

75
00:05:25,191 --> 00:05:27,182
- Dude! Dude!
- What?

76
00:05:27,293 --> 00:05:28,453
Later!

77
00:05:30,029 --> 00:05:31,121
Dick!

78
00:05:32,198 --> 00:05:36,601
<i>Message 21, received at 1:18 a. m.</i>

79
00:05:36,703 --> 00:05:39,900
<i>Fuck you, asshole!</i>

80
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:41,166
Man, that fish place sucked.

81
00:05:41,274 --> 00:05:43,071
<i>- Let's not go there this time.
I just wanted to let you know</i>

82
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:44,837
<i>- that I'm over you.
- I know you like the fish taco, but...</i>

83
00:05:44,944 --> 00:05:46,206
- Hey, what up, player?
- What's up?

84
00:05:46,312 --> 00:05:51,249
<i>I never want to see
or hear from you again.</i>

85
00:05:51,651 --> 00:05:55,519
<i>You're a bad man, Jay.</i>

86
00:06:07,467 --> 00:06:09,162
So, I'm not doing anyone any favors

87
00:06:09,268 --> 00:06:12,669
by sticking in a relationship
that I know isn't going to work.

88
00:06:14,307 --> 00:06:18,744
You know, it takes a special kind of woman
to make a black-white relationship work.

89
00:06:19,245 --> 00:06:24,911
Don't get me wrong, she was great for lots,
you know, rides, whatever.

90
00:06:25,017 --> 00:06:26,348
She's new.

91
00:06:26,452 --> 00:06:27,476
Who, the blonde?

92
00:06:27,587 --> 00:06:30,385
Dude, that's who I told you about.
Mindy the Mauler?

93
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:33,755
- So not worth it.
- No, the black girl. She's kind of cute.

94
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:35,760
You know black chicks don't dig me.

95
00:06:35,862 --> 00:06:40,196
I can't compete with those
Alpha male, talented-tenth,

96
00:06:40,366 --> 00:06:42,698
football-playing lawyer types they're all into.

97
00:06:42,802 --> 00:06:44,463
- Guys like your buddy, Drake.
- Like Drake.

98
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:47,095
I think that well-developed pectoral muscles

99
00:06:47,206 --> 00:06:50,573
eventually lead to back pain later in life.
I read that.

100
00:06:50,676 --> 00:06:52,701
That reminds me, tomorrow,
can you give me a ride?

101
00:06:52,812 --> 00:06:55,576
- I gotta meet Drake and his family for lunch.
- Free food?

102
00:06:55,681 --> 00:06:58,514
- Well, yeah, but you can't stay.
- Enjoy the bus ride.

103
00:06:58,618 --> 00:07:00,415
Dude!

104
00:07:03,489 --> 00:07:04,456
Ooh!

105
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:09,020
That's the girl from the record store. Okay.

106
00:07:10,229 --> 00:07:12,754
- I'll tell you what? Give me your lighter.
- You don't smoke.

107
00:07:12,865 --> 00:07:14,799
I know that. You know that.

108
00:07:14,967 --> 00:07:19,700
Sorry, sorry.
Go forth, be fruitful and multiply.

109
00:07:20,039 --> 00:07:23,975
<i>Thank you. Thanks a lot, guys.
Stick around for the Bleeding Thumbs.</i>

110
00:07:24,076 --> 00:07:25,407
<i>They're up next.</i>

111
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:48,264
- You know her, too?
- We used to hike Runyon Canyon together.

112
00:07:48,367 --> 00:07:52,030
Code red. Code red, dude! Check the door.

113
00:09:05,978 --> 00:09:07,843
- Hey! There's the best man, now!
- What's up, man?

114
00:09:07,947 --> 00:09:08,971
How are you?

115
00:09:09,081 --> 00:09:11,641
Sorry I'm late, everybody.
You didn't have to wait for me.

116
00:09:11,751 --> 00:09:15,243
- That's what I said.
- Hi, J.C.

117
00:09:15,354 --> 00:09:18,084
- So, Jay, how's your family?
- Good.

118
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:21,921
Still the only black folk in Kazakhstan,
but Pops goes where the oil is.

119
00:09:22,028 --> 00:09:23,893
Well, Jay, tell them we said, "Hello,"

120
00:09:23,996 --> 00:09:24,963
- will you?
- I will.

121
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:26,759
What's the closest thing
to barbecue in here?

122
00:09:26,866 --> 00:09:29,198
Well, actually, I'm going to order
for the table.

123
00:09:29,302 --> 00:09:31,133
That way we can all share.

124
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:35,367
Well, that sounds nice, doesn't it?
It's like we're on vacation or something.

125
00:09:35,908 --> 00:09:39,674
Well, Mrs. Moore,
you may want to try this mango lassi.

126
00:09:39,812 --> 00:09:43,179
It's a mango-flavored yogurt drink,
and it's really exotic.

127
00:09:43,316 --> 00:09:45,978
- First of all, honey, just call me Jerri.
- Okay.

128
00:09:46,686 --> 00:09:50,645
And I, for one,
am up for trying something different.

129
00:09:51,624 --> 00:09:54,149
Bet that's gonna give her gas.

130
00:09:56,562 --> 00:09:57,961
Mama!

131
00:09:58,064 --> 00:10:00,055
- Look here, Drake.
- Yes, sir.

132
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:02,828
I was talking to some of my brothers,
back in Texas.

133
00:10:02,935 --> 00:10:05,301
Seems that folks are starting
to get a little curious

134
00:10:05,404 --> 00:10:07,531
about their role in the wedding.

135
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:10,700
Well, Dad, I mean,
we don't wanna burden people too much.

136
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:13,711
- Right. Right.
- I mean just having them there is enough.

137
00:10:13,813 --> 00:10:16,805
I know, son, but they're family.
They wanna be a part of it.

138
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:19,578
Now, I know you got your boy, Jay, here,
as your best man,

139
00:10:19,685 --> 00:10:22,950
but I don't think it would hurt
to have a couple of your cousins

140
00:10:23,055 --> 00:10:24,022
as groomsmen or something.

141
00:10:24,156 --> 00:10:27,990
Well, baby, we've already got
four bridesmaids and four groomsmen.

142
00:10:28,094 --> 00:10:30,062
Hell, add a couple more.
Y'all got the money.

143
00:10:30,162 --> 00:10:31,254
It's not that simple.

144
00:10:31,364 --> 00:10:34,697
Come on, J.C., the Moores
would like to do what they can.

145
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:38,429
You know what? The engagement fish fry
Uncle Lewis put together

146
00:10:38,537 --> 00:10:39,970
was more than enough.

147
00:10:40,072 --> 00:10:42,597
I thought the fish fry was
for Curtis getting out of jail.

148
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:46,542
No, no. I think it was for both,
for the engagement and for Curtis.

149
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:50,241
- Yeah, I think it was for both.
- I see. So our family's too country for you?

150
00:10:50,349 --> 00:10:52,146
- No, no, no.
- Dad, no one's saying that.

151
00:10:52,251 --> 00:10:55,982
- Okay, listen, I gotta go.
- Did she say "ghetto"?

152
00:10:57,223 --> 00:11:01,785
No, no, no. I said "got to go"!
As in, "have to!"

153
00:11:02,061 --> 00:11:04,825
- As in, the ladies room.
- Right.

154
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:06,192
Baby, I didn't say "ghetto. "

155
00:11:06,298 --> 00:11:08,027
Dad!

156
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:11,692
This is J.C.'s one time to get married.
She just wants it to be perfect.

157
00:11:11,804 --> 00:11:14,329
Maybe it'd be perfect
if we didn't show up at all.

158
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:17,238
Get through law school
and forget where you come from, boy.

159
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:22,007
Look, how about one of the younger kids
can be the ring bearer.

160
00:11:22,114 --> 00:11:23,979
Fine. Huh?

161
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:27,314
Well, if you'll excuse me.
I'm gonna go to the ladies' room.

162
00:11:30,556 --> 00:11:33,548
So, Jay, are you bringing
anyone special to the wedding?

163
00:11:33,659 --> 00:11:34,990
No.

164
00:11:35,094 --> 00:11:39,895
Jay just pulled a disappearing act
on some girl he was dating, Beth.

165
00:11:39,999 --> 00:11:42,126
Beth, huh? Is she a sister?

166
00:11:42,234 --> 00:11:43,826
She's mixed.

167
00:11:44,003 --> 00:11:45,971
Mixed with what, Jay?

168
00:11:46,072 --> 00:11:47,096
English and German.

169
00:11:48,274 --> 00:11:49,605
What?

170
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:50,698
You think that's easy?

171
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:52,675
Think about the food
she had to grow up with.

172
00:11:52,778 --> 00:11:54,678
See you couldn't get away with that
with a sister, Jay.

173
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:56,805
You've been playing around
with too many of them white girls.

174
00:11:56,916 --> 00:11:59,248
That's why you can't settle down.

175
00:11:59,351 --> 00:12:01,842
Boy, what's wrong with you,
are you color-struck?

176
00:12:01,954 --> 00:12:04,718
No! The first woman
I ever kissed was a sister.

177
00:12:04,824 --> 00:12:06,917
Boy, your mama don't count.

178
00:12:09,428 --> 00:12:12,192
I remember when Jerri's father
and I were courting.

179
00:12:12,298 --> 00:12:15,665
People didn't take too kindly to such
a fair-skinded woman, such as myself,

180
00:12:15,768 --> 00:12:17,861
dating a dark man.

181
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:21,872
People thought we was mixing. Well!

182
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:24,509
They almost lynched your father,

183
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:27,977
all on account of thinking, you know,
I was passing for white.

184
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:30,378
Woman, the only thing
you can pass for is crazy!

185
00:12:30,483 --> 00:12:32,974
- Sam!
- Boy, I will bust you back to crazy!

186
00:12:33,085 --> 00:12:35,610
You letting him talk to me like that!

187
00:12:35,721 --> 00:12:37,951
You hear him talking to me like this?

188
00:12:40,893 --> 00:12:44,693
- Mama. Jay, do something!
- Grandma, Grandma.

189
00:12:44,797 --> 00:12:47,027
Hold on, Grandma!

190
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:48,790
I will knock you out!

191
00:12:51,537 --> 00:12:55,735
You should have seen her, Drake.
She came there to kill me, man.

192
00:12:55,841 --> 00:12:57,206
Women are a trip.

193
00:12:57,343 --> 00:12:59,743
You dated white girls back in the day, right?

194
00:12:59,845 --> 00:13:03,110
Yeah, I mean, you know, a little in college.
On the sly, though.

195
00:13:03,215 --> 00:13:06,742
My mother would've kicked my teeth in,
if she knew I was messing with a white girl.

196
00:13:06,852 --> 00:13:10,413
But, you, your parents were always so cool
with everything you did.

197
00:13:10,523 --> 00:13:11,888
Matter of fact, remember that time

198
00:13:11,991 --> 00:13:14,459
they let us set those bottle rockets off
in your backyard?

199
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:18,326
Or we asked them for beer and
they actually gave us a sip of their own?

200
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:21,399
Drake, those rockets nearly
burned down the neighbors' roof.

201
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:25,903
Yeah, man, but they let us
try stuff on our own,

202
00:13:26,005 --> 00:13:28,166
so we could have the experience
for ourselves.

203
00:13:28,274 --> 00:13:29,571
So we could be well-rounded.

204
00:13:29,675 --> 00:13:32,906
Remember what your pop said in there?
I'm not well-rounded.

205
00:13:33,012 --> 00:13:35,037
I date too many white girls.

206
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:41,984
Lately, it's been nothing but hysteria,
headaches and bad breakups.

207
00:13:42,688 --> 00:13:44,519
God! I'm 30 years old.

208
00:13:45,591 --> 00:13:48,059
I should be looking to settle down.

209
00:13:50,029 --> 00:13:52,862
The common denominator
in all my shit relationships is that

210
00:13:52,965 --> 00:13:55,160
- all the girls were white.
- And you?

211
00:13:55,267 --> 00:13:56,256
What?

212
00:13:56,368 --> 00:13:59,394
I mean, you're also a common variable
in the whole equation.

213
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:01,905
Whatever, that's beyond the point.

214
00:14:02,208 --> 00:14:03,175
Okay.

215
00:14:04,076 --> 00:14:07,136
I'm going to have to give up white girls,
cold turkey.

216
00:14:07,246 --> 00:14:10,511
Really? Okay, well,

217
00:14:11,951 --> 00:14:15,614
if you're lucky, they might have a patch
that'll help you through it.

218
00:14:18,324 --> 00:14:21,885
- So, you sure you don't need a ride?
- No. My ride's on its way.

219
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:04,525
Hey, I was wondering if you could
put these on hold for me until tomorrow.

220
00:15:04,637 --> 00:15:08,505
- Sure
- It's Matt. Two "T's. "

221
00:15:08,607 --> 00:15:10,666
- Thanks.
- Thin Lizzy, huh?

222
00:15:10,876 --> 00:15:12,400
Yeah!

223
00:15:12,511 --> 00:15:14,741
- They're fucking great.
- Yeah!

224
00:15:14,847 --> 00:15:17,611
Kind of cheesy,
but I think we all get in the mood

225
00:15:17,716 --> 00:15:20,651
for a little Irish butt-rock,
every now and then.

226
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:23,313
I like Nashville Pussy, too.

227
00:15:26,258 --> 00:15:28,283
Hey! You guys are hiring?

228
00:15:28,394 --> 00:15:30,328
You a hip-hop head?

229
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:32,088
What?

230
00:15:32,197 --> 00:15:35,530
Gerry's our hip-hop guy.
He's moving back to Phoenix.

231
00:15:36,402 --> 00:15:40,031
But you can't spell McKenzie
without the MC.

232
00:15:41,674 --> 00:15:45,701
That's my last name, McKenzie.
MC, get it? Hip-hop?

233
00:15:47,479 --> 00:15:49,140
Can I get an application?

234
00:15:49,248 --> 00:15:51,341
Sure.

235
00:15:54,086 --> 00:15:57,283
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

236
00:16:01,727 --> 00:16:03,718
Dude, I scored!

237
00:16:03,829 --> 00:16:06,662
I got an application
to be her hip-hop expert.

238
00:16:06,765 --> 00:16:08,892
Dude, don't be desperate.
You don't know anything about hip-hop.

239
00:16:09,001 --> 00:16:11,799
I know, but how hard could it be? It's rap.

240
00:16:12,204 --> 00:16:14,536
Now the little guy wants a job.

241
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:18,610
Where can I find her?

242
00:16:18,711 --> 00:16:20,008
Yeah.

243
00:16:20,112 --> 00:16:22,012
Dude, maybe I gotta stop dating white girls.

244
00:16:22,114 --> 00:16:24,878
That'd rule out Miss Molly May-I-Have-Some.

245
00:16:27,052 --> 00:16:29,282
Hey, you check out the Internet site
I told you about?

246
00:16:29,388 --> 00:16:31,618
Dude, that's for desperate people.

247
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:33,322
Yeah.

248
00:16:33,592 --> 00:16:38,222
Hey, I've got a job, an apartment,
no kids and I've never been to jail.

249
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:39,631
Uh-huh.

250
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:43,764
<i>I'll have them lined up like JET centerfolds.</i>

251
00:16:43,936 --> 00:16:48,964
You know the magazine?
Dude, you're so not getting this job.

252
00:16:49,975 --> 00:16:51,340
Who's first?

253
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:03,317
- Tam. Tamiko. Tamiko.
- She's flexible.

254
00:17:03,422 --> 00:17:06,414
Single black female from Santa Monica.

255
00:17:06,592 --> 00:17:10,028
She's cute. Poor girl,
may the force be with her.

256
00:17:11,463 --> 00:17:13,863
Store's closing.

257
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:16,431
Is this together?

258
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:19,561
I'll just finish reading it some other time.

259
00:17:19,772 --> 00:17:22,798
Yeah, me, too. Thank you.

260
00:17:28,247 --> 00:17:30,579
So, do you like extreme sports?

261
00:17:30,682 --> 00:17:34,413
- Well, Tamiko. Tamiko.
- Tamiko.

262
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:40,152
Tamiko. Tamiko. I once did a rolling stop
with the LAPD right behind me.

263
00:17:40,259 --> 00:17:46,289
No. I'm talking about skydiving,
bungee jumping, that kind of stuff.

264
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:48,798
- What, you're serious?
- Yeah, I'm serious, dude.

265
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:52,632
Well, then, no.
Isn't being black extreme enough?

266
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:55,366
Actually, I'm a model, actress and singer.

267
00:17:55,474 --> 00:17:59,467
Get the heck out of here.
You are not a model and actress and singer.

268
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:00,567
I am.

269
00:18:00,679 --> 00:18:03,705
Dude, there are like two of those
in the whole entire world.

270
00:18:03,816 --> 00:18:05,249
But I guess you're in the right place for it.

271
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:07,944
Hey, let's see if we can get one of your
colleagues to bring us some more rolls.

272
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:13,418
Dude, I was kidding. That's a joke. Come on.

273
00:18:13,525 --> 00:18:16,983
Hi. I'm Nadeen, sorry I'm late.

274
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:19,121
It's okay.

275
00:18:19,298 --> 00:18:21,163
So basically, you draw cartoons?

276
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:24,235
- Graphic novels.
- Comic books.

277
00:18:24,336 --> 00:18:26,099
Graphic novels.

278
00:18:27,473 --> 00:18:29,600
- Graphic novels.
- Okay.

279
00:18:29,908 --> 00:18:33,469
<i>I consider myself an astronautl
senatorlphilosopher king.</i>

280
00:18:33,579 --> 00:18:35,069
I bet if I look real hard,

281
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:37,705
there's an adrenaline junkie
buried somewhere beneath.

282
00:18:37,816 --> 00:18:40,080
- There isn't.
- Okay.

283
00:18:40,252 --> 00:18:42,277
So you're having a good time, right?

284
00:18:42,387 --> 00:18:43,877
You know, I am.

285
00:18:44,089 --> 00:18:47,388
Look, Jay, you're funny, but...

286
00:18:47,493 --> 00:18:49,586
- But what?
- What kind of car do you drive?

287
00:18:49,695 --> 00:18:51,253
Actually, I don't have a car.

288
00:18:51,363 --> 00:18:54,161
Carless in Los Angeles?

289
00:19:02,841 --> 00:19:06,242
Come on, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean any of that. Don't listen to me.

290
00:19:06,345 --> 00:19:10,372
No, no. You're right. You're right.

291
00:19:10,482 --> 00:19:13,815
I don't know if you're mature enough
for anything beyond us just being friends.

292
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:16,479
- What? Really?
- I've gotta think about my kids.

293
00:19:16,588 --> 00:19:21,287
Dude, I told you that wasn't going to be a
problem. Do they have a PlayStation?

294
00:19:21,393 --> 00:19:25,022
I'll be right back.

295
00:19:38,377 --> 00:19:40,208
Frick!

296
00:19:46,952 --> 00:19:48,112
Nerd up, Jay!

297
00:19:48,253 --> 00:19:50,346
- Hey, hey! What's up, dude?
- What's the good word, Jay?

298
00:19:50,455 --> 00:19:53,424
Dude, dude. Easy. Easy.
Just over this project. Dude!

299
00:19:53,525 --> 00:19:56,494
Hey, I heard on Monday,
we start Hammerhead.

300
00:19:56,595 --> 00:19:58,654
Yeah, boy!

301
00:19:58,764 --> 00:20:01,858
I'm thinking about starting my own project
with all black superheroes.

302
00:20:01,967 --> 00:20:05,994
- You should totally do a video game.
- Yeah, dude, kids don't read anymore.

303
00:20:06,104 --> 00:20:09,505
Hey, speaking of which,
how is Operation Brown Sugar going?

304
00:20:09,608 --> 00:20:10,666
Dude!

305
00:20:10,776 --> 00:20:13,609
- What? I had to tell somebody.
- Come on, we got bets, all right?

306
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:15,839
It's a nightmare, did you share that, too?

307
00:20:15,948 --> 00:20:17,939
I really don't see black chicks
digging this guy.

308
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:19,017
- Neither do I.
- Dude!

309
00:20:19,117 --> 00:20:21,278
- I don't.
- Hey, got an idea.

310
00:20:21,453 --> 00:20:22,442
- Idea?
- Got an idea.

311
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:25,352
You know how I have
that smoking hot girlfriend?

312
00:20:25,457 --> 00:20:28,688
Well, her sister just moved to town.
I could set you up.

313
00:20:28,794 --> 00:20:30,261
- I mean, she's Asian.
- Me rikey.

314
00:20:30,362 --> 00:20:31,727
I don't know if that's
against the rules or whatever.

315
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:33,263
No. No.

316
00:20:33,365 --> 00:20:35,265
- I'll get you her number.
- Really? Do it.

317
00:20:35,367 --> 00:20:37,733
- Holla! We want prenup.
- Do it!

318
00:20:39,504 --> 00:20:41,267
- Stay proud.
- Get out.

319
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:44,736
Stay proud!

320
00:20:49,948 --> 00:20:52,610
So, Operation Brown Sugar, huh?

321
00:20:53,385 --> 00:20:56,218
Yeah, Billy let the cat out of the bag.

322
00:20:56,622 --> 00:21:00,718
No, I think you have a point.
I think this country is so repressed.

323
00:21:00,826 --> 00:21:04,887
Nobody is comfortable talking
about sex or race in a frank manner.

324
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:07,198
I remember this one time,

325
00:21:07,332 --> 00:21:09,425
I brought this white guy
that I was seeing in college

326
00:21:09,534 --> 00:21:11,331
home to meet my folks.

327
00:21:11,436 --> 00:21:14,234
So we get to my house,
we walk through the door,

328
00:21:14,339 --> 00:21:18,139
and before I can even
introduce him to my parents,

329
00:21:18,243 --> 00:21:21,144
he takes off his shoes and starts bowing.

330
00:21:21,246 --> 00:21:24,909
And then he gets all embarrassed.
And somehow it's my fault?

331
00:21:25,017 --> 00:21:28,680
My fault for not warning him
that I wasn't a stereotype?

332
00:21:28,787 --> 00:21:30,687
God, I hate white people.

333
00:21:31,623 --> 00:21:33,181
Me, too.

334
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:35,055
That's a joke.

335
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:38,618
I get it. No, you're totally right.

336
00:21:38,730 --> 00:21:41,028
People fetishize each other all the time.

337
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:43,931
Everyone wants to be seen
as a sexual being.

338
00:21:46,505 --> 00:21:50,669
Pet peeve, sexual stereotypes.

339
00:21:50,776 --> 00:21:54,212
Like all black men are supposed
to be these wild, virile stallions.

340
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:56,804
It's so not true.

341
00:21:56,915 --> 00:21:58,473
No?

342
00:21:58,617 --> 00:22:00,608
Well, I mean, it can be.

343
00:22:00,719 --> 00:22:06,749
It is, most of the time. But not always.
You know. But it is.

344
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:25,268
<i>I don't understand it,
I never heard from her again.</i>

345
00:22:25,377 --> 00:22:27,242
<i>I really thought we had something.</i>

346
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:29,371
Man, it serves you right.

347
00:22:29,481 --> 00:22:31,142
The way you treat
half those women you date.

348
00:22:31,249 --> 00:22:35,049
- Whatever. They come after me.
- Yeah, right.

349
00:22:35,153 --> 00:22:37,621
You think J.C. Has any friends
she could set me up with?

350
00:22:37,723 --> 00:22:41,853
J.C. Is so on edge
about my family cutting up at the wedding.

351
00:22:43,028 --> 00:22:45,826
Promised her everything's going to be okay,
but I can't guarantee that.

352
00:22:45,931 --> 00:22:47,956
<i>What up, cuz?
Yeah, guess who this is.</i>

353
00:22:48,066 --> 00:22:50,125
<i>All right, man, for sure.</i>

354
00:22:50,235 --> 00:22:52,703
<i>It's Pooh Bear, nigga! Yeah. Hey!</i>

355
00:22:52,804 --> 00:22:56,137
We over here getting high!
Now, nigga, guess who I'm with.

356
00:22:56,241 --> 00:22:58,573
- Tell him my name. Tell him my name!
- Quit, nigga!

357
00:22:58,677 --> 00:23:00,474
Okay, we over here with Q-Ball.

358
00:23:00,579 --> 00:23:04,037
<i>There you go! Nigga get to Cali,
he just wanna act like he gangsta and shit.</i>

359
00:23:04,149 --> 00:23:06,310
<i>We like Cooley High in this motherfucker!</i>

360
00:23:06,418 --> 00:23:07,680
<i>Hey, listen.</i>

361
00:23:07,886 --> 00:23:09,285
We gonna come to the wedding

362
00:23:09,388 --> 00:23:13,154
<i>and turn it out!
And we gonna turn that mother, boy.</i>

363
00:23:13,258 --> 00:23:16,455
You're dead. J.C.'s gonna kill you.

364
00:23:23,135 --> 00:23:25,763
Come on, J.C., you were in a sorority,

365
00:23:25,871 --> 00:23:28,362
you've got to have somebody
you can set me up with.

366
00:23:28,473 --> 00:23:30,202
What harm could it possibly do?
Hey, buddy.

367
00:23:30,308 --> 00:23:32,640
Come on. All right, at least tell me why not.

368
00:23:32,744 --> 00:23:36,544
Well, let's see. You are immature.
You have issues with commitment.

369
00:23:36,648 --> 00:23:40,106
You have a silly job, silly friends.
You're cheap.

370
00:23:40,218 --> 00:23:42,277
And your comprehension of romance
is a joke!

371
00:23:42,387 --> 00:23:43,649
Why would I put any of my friends
through that?

372
00:23:43,755 --> 00:23:44,744
- J.C.!
- 'Cause I'm a nice guy.

373
00:23:44,856 --> 00:23:46,221
Catherine, you're early.

374
00:23:46,324 --> 00:23:48,690
Really? I totally got lost.

375
00:23:48,794 --> 00:23:50,762
- Wow, nice shirt.
- Thanks.

376
00:23:51,062 --> 00:23:53,929
Jay, this is Catherine Williamson,
a client of mine.

377
00:23:54,166 --> 00:23:55,565
A writer, eh?

378
00:23:55,667 --> 00:23:58,465
Yes, and she's doing
a book signing tomorrow,

379
00:23:58,570 --> 00:24:00,435
and we're trying to convince her
to do a reading tour.

380
00:24:00,539 --> 00:24:01,563
What's your book called?

381
00:24:01,673 --> 00:24:03,197
<i>The Inevitable Was Bound To Happen.</i>

382
00:24:03,308 --> 00:24:06,038
<i>The New York Times said it can
single-handedly usher black fiction</i>

383
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:07,475
back into the new century.

384
00:24:07,579 --> 00:24:10,912
- Sorry, I haven't read it.
- That's right. No pictures.

385
00:24:11,016 --> 00:24:12,210
Jay likes comic books.

386
00:24:12,317 --> 00:24:13,579
- Graphic novels.
- Whatever.

387
00:24:13,685 --> 00:24:16,620
- I'm sure it's good, though.
- It is. Okay, that's enough.

388
00:24:16,721 --> 00:24:17,813
- We're gonna go now.
- Okay.

389
00:24:17,923 --> 00:24:19,447
Catherine, it was really nice meeting you.

390
00:24:19,558 --> 00:24:21,788
I'm gonna read your book
as soon as I get a chance.

391
00:24:21,893 --> 00:24:24,020
- Okay, goodie.
- All right.

392
00:24:30,202 --> 00:24:32,500
All righty, then, here you go.

393
00:24:32,604 --> 00:24:34,299
And I'm sorry about that.

394
00:24:34,406 --> 00:24:35,600
No problem.

395
00:24:36,808 --> 00:24:42,007
Oh, my goodness, I'm sorry.
I have to take this. Okay, just...

396
00:24:42,848 --> 00:24:44,042
J.C. Evans.

397
00:24:44,149 --> 00:24:47,277
Catherine and I really shared something
back there, don't you think?

398
00:24:47,385 --> 00:24:48,443
What do you want?

399
00:24:48,553 --> 00:24:50,020
Come on, I just need you
to get me her number.

400
00:24:50,121 --> 00:24:52,180
I'll be on my best behavior, I promise.

401
00:24:52,290 --> 00:24:54,451
Tough. Goodbye.

402
00:24:57,996 --> 00:24:58,963
Frick.

403
00:25:02,067 --> 00:25:03,159
She's cute.

404
00:25:14,946 --> 00:25:17,938
You really ready to be hip-hop McKenzie
eight hours a day?

405
00:25:18,049 --> 00:25:22,816
Nope, but I really dig Molly, right?
So I gotta do it.

406
00:25:22,921 --> 00:25:25,481
I wish you luck.
Sure you don't want to come?

407
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:29,822
What with you? Stalk the writer chick? No.

408
00:25:29,928 --> 00:25:32,055
I have more hip-hop immersing to do.

409
00:25:33,765 --> 00:25:36,199
You gots more hip-hop immersing to do.

410
00:25:36,301 --> 00:25:38,360
Right, "gots. "

411
00:26:02,561 --> 00:26:06,793
Catherine? Hey! The guy from the other day.

412
00:26:06,898 --> 00:26:09,696
What do you want?
What are you doing here?

413
00:26:09,801 --> 00:26:12,361
What are you doing here?
Aren't you supposed to be signing books?

414
00:26:12,470 --> 00:26:13,960
Yeah, I don't know.

415
00:26:14,072 --> 00:26:15,437
Actually, they already started,

416
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:17,405
so I figure, I don't know,
there's no reason for me to be here.

417
00:26:17,509 --> 00:26:18,498
They know I'm not coming now,

418
00:26:18,610 --> 00:26:19,907
- so it's just easier...
- Will you sign mine, then?

419
00:26:20,011 --> 00:26:21,501
You know, I really just feel like I should go

420
00:26:21,613 --> 00:26:23,308
- or leave, or whatever.
- You could put your phone number

421
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:25,383
right here and I could
ask you out sometime.

422
00:26:25,483 --> 00:26:28,316
Yeah, I'm so sorry.
I'm so wretchedly bad with names.

423
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:31,321
- Jay.
- Jay. Right, okay, Jay. Jay.

424
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:34,551
Okay, so, Jay, you don't know,
like, anything else about me.

425
00:26:34,659 --> 00:26:38,356
So we go out, have a couple of drinks,
and I get to learn a thing or two about you.

426
00:26:38,463 --> 00:26:39,987
Okay. Well, I don't know
anything about you, so...

427
00:26:40,098 --> 00:26:45,092
That's okay. I'll talk plenty about myself,
don't worry. Come on, it'll be fun.

428
00:26:45,203 --> 00:26:47,501
Okay.

429
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:51,841
Okay, so, who's
the Prime Minister of Canada?

430
00:26:52,210 --> 00:26:53,939
- I don't know.
- I do.

431
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:55,268
So?

432
00:26:56,014 --> 00:27:00,451
So, this is some kind of test. Okay, okay.

433
00:27:01,686 --> 00:27:03,313
Dude, I don't know.

434
00:27:04,055 --> 00:27:06,148
Brian, Brian, Brian, Brian, Brian...

435
00:27:06,725 --> 00:27:08,556
Brian Mulroney.

436
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:10,525
Yeah, actually, he left office,
like, a decade ago.

437
00:27:10,629 --> 00:27:13,325
But he was, at one point,
Prime Minister of Canada, right?

438
00:27:13,431 --> 00:27:15,058
Come on. That's gotta count for something.

439
00:27:15,166 --> 00:27:18,499
Yeah, Mulroney is incorrect,
but the last guy that I asked that to

440
00:27:18,603 --> 00:27:20,161
thought the answer was Dudley Do-Right.

441
00:27:20,271 --> 00:27:24,207
So actually, we can sort of keep that in mind
and count that as a point for you.

442
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:25,708
- I'll see you later.
- Wait, what are...

443
00:27:26,945 --> 00:27:30,278
- Dude, who's the Prime Minister of Canada?
- I don't know, bro.

444
00:27:33,551 --> 00:27:34,518
Sorry.

445
00:27:39,724 --> 00:27:42,488
Jean Chrétien.

446
00:27:42,761 --> 00:27:47,494
Very good. Okay, so who let you in
on that little piece of common knowledge.

447
00:27:47,599 --> 00:27:48,725
Information.

448
00:27:49,534 --> 00:27:50,796
Okay. Clever.

449
00:27:50,902 --> 00:27:53,268
Vegetable oil. That's very efficient of you.

450
00:27:54,472 --> 00:27:55,769
Come on, Eracism?

451
00:27:55,874 --> 00:28:00,743
The only thing I hate worse than racism
itself are these Eracism bumper stickers.

452
00:28:00,845 --> 00:28:04,781
You know, I never pictured you for
a pithy one-word answer kind of girl.

453
00:28:04,883 --> 00:28:07,443
But the ride's nice. It's kind of cute.

454
00:28:07,552 --> 00:28:10,919
Well, I'm glad you like it. Night.

455
00:28:12,090 --> 00:28:15,321
You know, that's good.
Because I never pictured myself

456
00:28:15,427 --> 00:28:17,258
going out with a bumper sticker kind of girl.

457
00:28:17,362 --> 00:28:19,091
- There's hope for us yet.
- Sure there is.

458
00:28:19,197 --> 00:28:23,634
Come on. One drink.
One itty-bitty drink, I beg of you.

459
00:28:23,735 --> 00:28:26,636
Okay, so let's hear it.

460
00:28:26,738 --> 00:28:28,831
- Hear what?
- Begging?

461
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:30,965
What? Really?

462
00:28:33,645 --> 00:28:35,545
Okay, I'll play.

463
00:28:36,214 --> 00:28:39,547
Mars Blackmon begging
or James Brown begging?

464
00:28:40,051 --> 00:28:44,317
Wow, a student of the genre.
Okay, let's go Blackmon,

465
00:28:44,422 --> 00:28:48,119
because I don't really know you
well enough for James Brown.

466
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:55,256
Please, baby, please, baby.
Baby, baby, please.

467
00:28:56,034 --> 00:28:58,025
- Okay, not bad.
- Thank you.

468
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:00,469
So, how well do you know Inglewood?

469
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:03,132
- Not at all.
- So you better follow close.

470
00:29:03,241 --> 00:29:05,607
Actually, I don't have a car.

471
00:29:06,211 --> 00:29:08,338
Wow, carless in Los Angeles.

472
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:11,877
You're a total catch. Get in.

473
00:29:21,559 --> 00:29:24,392
Well, I really could never get by
without my car.

474
00:29:24,496 --> 00:29:27,465
I pretty much live out of it.
I mean, like, I'm constantly at the beach,

475
00:29:27,565 --> 00:29:30,261
even though I live in the Valley
with my family, here and there.

476
00:29:30,368 --> 00:29:32,359
And I also was born in Canada,

477
00:29:32,470 --> 00:29:35,496
which pretty much explains
my Prime Minister fascination.

478
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:39,168
Canada? Does that
make you African-Canadian?

479
00:29:39,277 --> 00:29:40,938
I didn't know we were up in Canada.

480
00:29:41,045 --> 00:29:44,139
Where did you think
all those runaway slaves were going?

481
00:29:44,549 --> 00:29:45,777
And actually, I'm Halfrican-Canadian,

482
00:29:45,884 --> 00:29:47,442
'cause my mother's white
and my dad is black.

483
00:29:47,552 --> 00:29:50,180
And so we pretty much would go
between Canada and Los Angeles.

484
00:29:50,288 --> 00:29:52,279
I didn't know black girls grew blue hair.

485
00:29:52,390 --> 00:29:55,882
Well, I didn't know you could
smoke a cigarette through a straw.

486
00:29:56,528 --> 00:29:59,429
It's not a straw. It's artistic flair.

487
00:29:59,531 --> 00:30:03,831
Okay. Yeah, my therapist said
that my artistic flair

488
00:30:03,935 --> 00:30:06,403
was covering up all my real emotions.

489
00:30:08,206 --> 00:30:12,700
- Therapist, huh?
- Oh, yeah. For like a million years now.

490
00:30:16,347 --> 00:30:18,178
Is that the radio?

491
00:30:18,483 --> 00:30:22,749
No, it's actually a mix tape.
My last boyfriend made it for me.

492
00:30:24,756 --> 00:30:25,723
Huh.

493
00:30:27,792 --> 00:30:28,759
Okay.

494
00:31:00,258 --> 00:31:03,694
- Thanks, Tim.
- Anytime, Cat.

495
00:31:04,562 --> 00:31:07,793
Please, I am making
an obscene amount of money.

496
00:31:07,966 --> 00:31:10,696
So I just feel guilty if I don't share.

497
00:31:12,637 --> 00:31:15,265
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

498
00:31:27,986 --> 00:31:30,887
I never really got into
the idea of therapy.

499
00:31:30,989 --> 00:31:34,288
The way I see it black people
go to church, not therapy.

500
00:31:34,392 --> 00:31:35,552
So it's church for you?

501
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:38,424
Actually, I don't do either.

502
00:31:38,529 --> 00:31:41,498
Well, you should give therapy a shot.

503
00:31:41,599 --> 00:31:44,796
I find I'm only really motivated
by fear and shame, anyhow.

504
00:31:44,903 --> 00:31:50,034
Lose that, I'm inside all day
eating nachos, playing PlayStation.

505
00:31:50,842 --> 00:31:52,605
I'll just leave it at that.

506
00:31:53,411 --> 00:31:55,936
Okay, you should totally
give therapy a shot.

507
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:00,081
Nice shirt.

508
00:32:01,219 --> 00:32:02,686
Is it vintage?

509
00:32:02,854 --> 00:32:04,788
No, actually. I made it.

510
00:32:05,556 --> 00:32:07,888
- No, you didn't.
- I did, too.

511
00:32:09,193 --> 00:32:11,354
Here look, no tags.

512
00:32:11,462 --> 00:32:15,023
You could have ripped them off,
for all I know.

513
00:32:15,934 --> 00:32:20,166
- What kind of sewing machine did you use?
- Okay, I used the kind with a needle.

514
00:32:23,274 --> 00:32:25,003
It's good.

515
00:32:27,946 --> 00:32:30,813
I need to excuse myself for a second.

516
00:32:30,915 --> 00:32:32,382
Okay.

517
00:32:32,517 --> 00:32:34,212
I'll be right back.

518
00:32:38,556 --> 00:32:41,320
You say "like" a lot.

519
00:32:42,093 --> 00:32:43,355
I know.

520
00:32:43,461 --> 00:32:45,053
Just making sure.

521
00:32:55,707 --> 00:32:57,572
She's quirky.

522
00:32:59,544 --> 00:33:01,876
And if she's this quirky
upon first meeting her,

523
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:04,881
who knows what kind of crazy lies beneath?

524
00:33:06,484 --> 00:33:10,716
Still, despite the rambling,

525
00:33:10,822 --> 00:33:13,154
and the "likes,"

526
00:33:13,291 --> 00:33:17,728
and the fact that her book
has the worst title in publishing history,

527
00:33:19,530 --> 00:33:21,794
I'm still having a good time.

528
00:33:23,201 --> 00:33:25,499
Like, a really good time.

529
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:31,599
Hey, thanks for listening, man.

530
00:33:33,277 --> 00:33:35,575
I don't work here, fool.

531
00:33:36,948 --> 00:33:39,075
He doesn't work here.

532
00:33:43,021 --> 00:33:45,683
Gotta remember to read her book. Yeah.

533
00:33:46,457 --> 00:33:49,153
You'll blow it
if you don't read her book, Jay.

534
00:33:55,933 --> 00:33:57,867
Oh, shit.

535
00:34:04,876 --> 00:34:08,869
- Get on out there, brother.
- I don't dance.

536
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:13,312
I do the cabbage patch
and the white boy shuffle. That's it.

537
00:34:13,418 --> 00:34:16,546
Made for a very traumatic childhood.

538
00:34:16,654 --> 00:34:18,713
I haven't danced since.

539
00:34:20,124 --> 00:34:22,183
Damn fool.

540
00:34:46,184 --> 00:34:47,208
I don't know. Then I was in high school,

541
00:34:47,318 --> 00:34:49,479
and we did this thing where we did, like,
this mock election, right,

542
00:34:49,587 --> 00:34:52,750
between, like, Reagan and Mondale
to kind of see, like, who would win.

543
00:34:53,157 --> 00:34:56,615
And we did this mock election,
and the votes came back, and I shit you not,

544
00:34:56,727 --> 00:34:59,355
no lie, the entire school voted for Reagan,
except for me.

545
00:34:59,464 --> 00:35:00,897
I couldn't believe it, you know?

546
00:35:00,998 --> 00:35:04,934
That's one more vote than Mondale got
from almost every other state.

547
00:35:05,036 --> 00:35:08,233
I know. Actually, I wrote in Jesse Jackson.

548
00:35:09,841 --> 00:35:12,332
Jesse. I think I like you.

549
00:35:12,577 --> 00:35:14,943
Duh. You've only been stalking me.

550
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:18,448
You know what, though?
I've had worse times.

551
00:35:19,517 --> 00:35:21,109
That's quite an endorsement.

552
00:35:21,219 --> 00:35:23,619
Yeah. I was trying not to, though.

553
00:35:35,433 --> 00:35:38,402
My therapist says
I'm this compulsive planner.

554
00:35:38,936 --> 00:35:42,201
But anyway, I just, I live up in the Hills,
so, like, if you're gonna come over,

555
00:35:42,306 --> 00:35:43,796
then, maybe we should just,
make a plan beforehand...

556
00:35:43,908 --> 00:35:45,307
If I'm gonna come over?

557
00:35:45,409 --> 00:35:47,900
Well, or not...

558
00:35:48,112 --> 00:35:51,309
No. I mean, yeah.
Yeah, I'd like to come over.

559
00:35:51,415 --> 00:35:54,350
- I'd love to.
- Okay. Okay, yeah.

560
00:35:54,986 --> 00:35:57,648
I'm not, like, a slut or anything,
just in case that's what you're thinking.

561
00:35:57,755 --> 00:36:00,246
- Not at all. Not at all.
- Okay. Good.

562
00:36:02,527 --> 00:36:03,653
It's done.

563
00:36:03,895 --> 00:36:06,022
I'll get us a new bottle.

564
00:36:31,522 --> 00:36:35,185
You know, I really can't believe
that you read my book so fast.

565
00:36:35,293 --> 00:36:37,022
Well, actually, I...

566
00:36:44,235 --> 00:36:46,260
That was decent.

567
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:49,533
The first one's usually not,
but that was really decent.

568
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:54,077
My therapist, his name is Fred. He says that,
really, the first kiss doesn't matter.

569
00:36:56,047 --> 00:37:00,882
But to me it does matter. It matters a lot,
because it's the very first time you've ever...

570
00:37:02,186 --> 00:37:06,646
And if you don't connect with someone in a
real way on that very first kiss, then...

571
00:37:28,112 --> 00:37:33,379
Actually, when I was little, my mom,
she used to let me light her cigarettes.

572
00:37:33,484 --> 00:37:34,951
So much love there.

573
00:37:36,587 --> 00:37:37,554
Hmm.

574
00:37:39,824 --> 00:37:43,089
You may be as screwed up as I am.

575
00:38:08,953 --> 00:38:09,920
Psst.

576
00:38:15,559 --> 00:38:16,526
Huh...

577
00:38:18,529 --> 00:38:22,226
Hey, Catherine.
Catherine. Hey!

578
00:38:24,802 --> 00:38:27,236
I didn't want to wake you,
but I have to get to work.

579
00:38:27,338 --> 00:38:28,362
Okay.

580
00:38:28,472 --> 00:38:31,635
I've got time for breakfast,
if you wanna grab something, we could...

581
00:38:31,742 --> 00:38:36,076
No, don't worry about it. It's fine, just...
I'm just not a morning person.

582
00:38:36,347 --> 00:38:40,716
Okay, then. I'll call you later, then, okay?

583
00:38:40,818 --> 00:38:42,752
Hey, I'll call you later, okay?

584
00:38:42,853 --> 00:38:44,946
Just do that.

585
00:38:47,658 --> 00:38:49,285
Okay.

586
00:39:02,506 --> 00:39:04,940
<i>Dude, she didn't even bother
to get out of bed.</i>

587
00:39:05,343 --> 00:39:09,109
It's another Candace all over again.
Another one-night stand.

588
00:39:10,581 --> 00:39:12,572
I should've danced with her.

589
00:39:12,683 --> 00:39:14,116
That's what I should've done.

590
00:39:14,218 --> 00:39:16,118
Dude, what the heck does that
have to do with anything?

591
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:19,280
<i>Dude, she didn't respect me
because I didn't dance with her.</i>

592
00:39:19,390 --> 00:39:23,451
What if I was bad in bed? Oh, God. That's it.

593
00:39:23,561 --> 00:39:28,521
The dick wasn't any good.
So now, I'm a shitty dancer and a lousy lay?

594
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:31,131
What kind of black man am I?

595
00:39:31,235 --> 00:39:33,362
<i>J.C. 's gonna tear you a new one
when she finds out.</i>

596
00:39:33,838 --> 00:39:37,740
Okay? And I'm not about to step
into the blast zone to stop her this time.

597
00:39:37,842 --> 00:39:39,776
I don't care. I think this girl is different.

598
00:39:39,877 --> 00:39:40,935
<i>Hell, yeah, she's different.</i>

599
00:39:41,545 --> 00:39:44,605
I met her once with J.C.
Girl's damn weird, if you ask me.

600
00:39:44,715 --> 00:39:46,239
<i>Man, you know what I mean.</i>

601
00:39:46,517 --> 00:39:48,747
Hold on. Hello?

602
00:39:48,853 --> 00:39:51,515
<i>Okay, so I totally have notes
on last evening.</i>

603
00:39:51,756 --> 00:39:53,519
I hope you don't think that's weird.

604
00:39:53,791 --> 00:39:55,224
What?

605
00:39:55,326 --> 00:39:58,227
<i>I was just writing down my
impressions of last evening</i>

606
00:39:58,396 --> 00:40:01,024
in my journal, which I totally do,
like, every single morning.

607
00:40:01,132 --> 00:40:03,430
And so I just thought I'd share.

608
00:40:04,201 --> 00:40:05,532
It rhymes.

609
00:40:05,636 --> 00:40:08,662
<i>God! I'm such a zombie in the morning
without my coffee and cigarette.</i>

610
00:40:08,773 --> 00:40:11,435
Anyway, okay, it's called,
"The Guy from Yesterday,"

611
00:40:11,575 --> 00:40:14,373
<i>and there are internal rhymes
for both Mulroney and Chrétien,</i>

612
00:40:14,478 --> 00:40:15,809
<i>so listen closely.</i>

613
00:40:55,085 --> 00:40:58,077
I used to think people would stare
if I was the only black guy

614
00:40:58,189 --> 00:40:59,918
who went with the only black girl.

615
00:41:00,024 --> 00:41:02,515
You know, like we'd be
even weirder together, or something.

616
00:41:02,626 --> 00:41:03,991
You're so thoroughly paranoid.

617
00:41:04,094 --> 00:41:05,686
- You think?
- No, I know.

618
00:41:08,065 --> 00:41:12,058
- Okay, so what's that guy's story?
- UCLA, obviously.

619
00:41:12,169 --> 00:41:15,866
- Totally!
- Has done a keg stand,

620
00:41:16,073 --> 00:41:20,134
has all Dave Matthews' records,
has never heard of Angela Davis.

621
00:41:20,244 --> 00:41:21,734
Oh, my God.

622
00:41:22,713 --> 00:41:25,375
Okay, so that was totally wrong, right there.

623
00:41:25,483 --> 00:41:27,974
Okay, okay, right there. What's his story?

624
00:41:28,152 --> 00:41:30,746
Dude, come on, that's way too easy.

625
00:41:32,523 --> 00:41:35,822
Oh, my God. Okay, so, you know what?
You can't judge a book by its cover.

626
00:41:35,926 --> 00:41:38,486
Wow. Clearly.

627
00:41:38,629 --> 00:41:40,654
Okay, okay. Right there.

628
00:41:42,566 --> 00:41:44,659
Dude. Okay, I give up.

629
00:41:45,636 --> 00:41:49,072
So, so what about me?

630
00:41:49,173 --> 00:41:50,936
You? I know you.

631
00:41:51,342 --> 00:41:53,469
Okay, so pretend you don't.

632
00:41:55,913 --> 00:41:57,881
Okay!

633
00:42:02,019 --> 00:42:02,986
Brr!

634
00:42:03,087 --> 00:42:05,055
- Okay, then.
- Yeah.

635
00:42:06,991 --> 00:42:11,928
You have never celebrated Kwanza, at least
not like we black folk are supposed to.

636
00:42:12,029 --> 00:42:15,294
You have voted Green.

637
00:42:15,399 --> 00:42:17,026
- Oh, yeah.
- Okay.

638
00:42:19,103 --> 00:42:22,266
You have never bailed on a friend.

639
00:42:22,373 --> 00:42:26,275
You're wrong, actually.
I totally bailed on J.C.

640
00:42:26,377 --> 00:42:30,837
She wanted me to do this book tour to
promote the novel, and I just bailed on her.

641
00:42:30,948 --> 00:42:34,213
Because, it's impossible
to be taken seriously as a writer

642
00:42:34,318 --> 00:42:36,309
when you talk like a total Valley girl.

643
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:39,287
- What?
- No, but when I get, like, nervous or excited,

644
00:42:39,423 --> 00:42:40,754
that's exactly how I sound.

645
00:42:40,858 --> 00:42:45,852
Listen, if you're going to let the world
tell you who you are, what you are,

646
00:42:47,731 --> 00:42:51,792
you ruin one of the most beautiful
things about yourself.

647
00:42:51,969 --> 00:42:53,527
Okay, how about this.

648
00:42:53,637 --> 00:42:58,904
I will read out loud,
the day that you and I go out dancing.

649
00:43:00,511 --> 00:43:02,035
Well, then, no rush.

650
00:43:02,146 --> 00:43:04,410
Okay, no rush. Perfect.

651
00:43:04,515 --> 00:43:07,006
I mean, I actually like dancing.

652
00:43:07,117 --> 00:43:10,052
I just will never do it in the presence
of any organism

653
00:43:10,154 --> 00:43:12,782
even remotely resembling a human being.

654
00:43:12,890 --> 00:43:15,120
Exactly. Ditto on the reading for me.

655
00:43:17,628 --> 00:43:20,096
- Hey, let's motor.
- Okay.

656
00:43:20,664 --> 00:43:23,098
I'm sure there's something
so massively wrong with her.

657
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:24,861
Jay, you say that about every girl you date.

658
00:43:24,969 --> 00:43:27,494
Okay, for starters,
she pays for everything,

659
00:43:28,038 --> 00:43:32,771
which in and of itself, isn't that bad,
but frick, man, nobody's that perfect.

660
00:43:33,010 --> 00:43:36,446
It's the little things, dude.
I'm telling you, they're clues, Matt.

661
00:43:36,547 --> 00:43:39,482
Why? What, does she, like, wear her watch
on the wrong wrist or something?

662
00:43:39,583 --> 00:43:40,777
No watch.

663
00:43:40,884 --> 00:43:43,682
Okay. Does she get food in her teeth
when she's eating?

664
00:43:43,787 --> 00:43:44,879
Chews with her mouth closed.

665
00:43:44,989 --> 00:43:47,048
- Well, does she bum your cigarettes?
- Yes!

666
00:43:47,157 --> 00:43:48,283
But she's real weird about it.

667
00:43:48,392 --> 00:43:52,260
Like, first she gives away all of hers
to every single freak who asks her,

668
00:43:52,363 --> 00:43:54,490
and then she starts bumming mine.

669
00:43:54,598 --> 00:43:57,123
- Did you tell her?
- Well, I was gonna end it.

670
00:43:57,234 --> 00:44:01,261
But, you know, just write her a note.
But then she bought some more smokes.

671
00:44:01,372 --> 00:44:03,169
- And?
- And that's another thing.

672
00:44:03,273 --> 00:44:06,800
We both smoke the same brand.
How do we know whose pack is whose?

673
00:44:06,910 --> 00:44:09,606
Jay, she sounds fantastic.

674
00:44:09,713 --> 00:44:11,476
- Yeah, I guess.
- Okay.

675
00:44:12,683 --> 00:44:16,380
- Matt?
- Molly. Hey, what's up?

676
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:19,388
Hey, you ready for the interview?

677
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:25,190
<i>Hells, yeah! I got my Source.
It's like the hip-hop Bible.</i>

678
00:44:26,030 --> 00:44:29,466
Why don't you just go back to the office,
and I'll send Sigmund in a second?

679
00:44:29,566 --> 00:44:31,932
Okay. I'll be right there. Word.

680
00:44:33,604 --> 00:44:35,936
Hello? "This is my friend, Jay"?

681
00:44:40,778 --> 00:44:43,975
Right? Right? Wish me luck!

682
00:44:44,748 --> 00:44:49,742
Mind what you have learned, young warrior.
Get you laid, it can.

683
00:44:52,222 --> 00:44:53,280
All right.

684
00:44:57,227 --> 00:45:01,061
- We'll start off with a few basic questions.
- Cool.

685
00:45:01,265 --> 00:45:05,326
If you're not prepared, please say so now.
Don't waste my time.

686
00:45:07,171 --> 00:45:11,369
<i>- Okay.
- Who produced the Wild Style soundtrack?</i>

687
00:45:11,475 --> 00:45:13,033
Blondie's Chris Stein, yo!

688
00:45:13,143 --> 00:45:16,476
<i>What's the third song on
Public Enemy's Yo! Bum Rush the Show?</i>

689
00:45:16,580 --> 00:45:17,672
<i>Miuzi Weighs a Ton.</i>

690
00:45:17,781 --> 00:45:20,443
Give me four of Ol' Dirty Bastard's aliases.

691
00:45:20,551 --> 00:45:25,215
ODB, Osirus, Big Baby Jesus
and Russell Jones.

692
00:45:25,322 --> 00:45:26,380
What's his birthday?

693
00:45:26,490 --> 00:45:30,950
November 11. No, 15th. November 15th.
For sure.

694
00:45:35,165 --> 00:45:37,690
- Is that it?
- Hardly.

695
00:45:39,570 --> 00:45:43,165
- Hey, Matt. Congratulations!
- Thanks!

696
00:45:52,916 --> 00:45:55,942
Thank you, Mr. And Mrs. Evans,
for having us all over today.

697
00:45:56,353 --> 00:46:01,518
Well, it's so nice to have our home graced
with such an illustrious cast of characters.

698
00:46:02,192 --> 00:46:08,756
A lawyer, pro football player,
best-selling author, and...

699
00:46:11,201 --> 00:46:14,796
Anyway, it's nice to have you.

700
00:46:15,672 --> 00:46:19,472
So, what team do you play for, Michael?

701
00:46:20,811 --> 00:46:23,211
- The Chargers.
- Chargers.

702
00:46:23,914 --> 00:46:28,283
You know, when I was a girl,
I was courted by a football player.

703
00:46:28,719 --> 00:46:31,779
Course, he was light-skinded, like myself.

704
00:46:33,023 --> 00:46:35,423
Sam! Don't pile that food
on your plate like that.

705
00:46:35,526 --> 00:46:38,290
You're going to get the itis,
and I don't mean Arthur.

706
00:46:38,395 --> 00:46:42,729
Look, woman, this is my stomach.
Let me eat what I want to eat.

707
00:46:46,503 --> 00:46:48,835
Excuse me. What is this "itis"?

708
00:46:48,939 --> 00:46:52,636
You know, the itis.
Sam gets it bad, too, girl.

709
00:46:54,278 --> 00:46:57,679
Eat a lot, sleep a lot. You know, Negritis.

710
00:47:04,154 --> 00:47:07,214
Look at you. Why you got to come
all the way up here and act so country?

711
00:47:07,324 --> 00:47:09,622
Look, the food is free.
You're supposed to eat it.

712
00:47:09,726 --> 00:47:13,059
"The food is free," see that's your attitude.
That is your attitude.

713
00:47:13,163 --> 00:47:16,394
- Darling, listen, hey...
- You better not fall asleep, either.

714
00:47:17,367 --> 00:47:19,096
I got plans for you.

715
00:47:21,205 --> 00:47:25,107
We're going to Mazatlàn
at the end of the year for Christmas,

716
00:47:25,209 --> 00:47:27,143
if his team doesn't make the playoffs.

717
00:47:27,244 --> 00:47:29,178
That sounds so romantic.

718
00:47:30,547 --> 00:47:32,139
- What, Jay?
- Nothing.

719
00:47:35,152 --> 00:47:37,450
It's just that the popular idea
of what's romantic

720
00:47:37,554 --> 00:47:40,717
seems to be tied directly to money. It's sad.

721
00:47:41,592 --> 00:47:43,082
Sweetie, I don't get it. What is he saying?

722
00:47:43,193 --> 00:47:46,253
Michael, what do you think
about the current overtime format, man?

723
00:47:46,363 --> 00:47:51,096
No, Drake, I really want to hear this. Jay?

724
00:47:51,201 --> 00:47:56,366
Well, I mean, what's so unique about
going on a cruise or buying a necklace?

725
00:47:57,140 --> 00:47:58,732
There are whole industries

726
00:47:58,842 --> 00:48:02,505
predicated on projecting
a commercial standard of romance.

727
00:48:02,613 --> 00:48:04,911
It's as commercial as Christmas.

728
00:48:05,015 --> 00:48:07,142
"Diamonds are a girl's best friend"?

729
00:48:07,251 --> 00:48:10,812
Diamonds are mined by people in Africa
who are practically slaves.

730
00:48:10,954 --> 00:48:13,422
I'm too principled to buy diamonds.

731
00:48:14,258 --> 00:48:18,126
- And too cheap.
- Oh, yeah! Much, much too cheap.

732
00:48:19,630 --> 00:48:20,995
That's true.

733
00:48:25,836 --> 00:48:28,532
- It's not as good as Mama's, is it?
- Hmm.

734
00:48:29,339 --> 00:48:31,432
Maybe we can take some home.

735
00:48:35,545 --> 00:48:37,479
And I finally chose the caterer.

736
00:48:37,581 --> 00:48:40,448
It's the same one that Sue used
for her wedding in '98.

737
00:48:41,818 --> 00:48:45,515
- Honey, you're going to love them.
- Yes, Mama.

738
00:48:45,622 --> 00:48:48,989
They've got this foie gras to die for.

739
00:48:49,092 --> 00:48:50,354
Oh, dear!

740
00:48:52,896 --> 00:48:56,423
What you don't want is for folks
to get food poisoning.

741
00:48:56,833 --> 00:48:57,822
Remember Rhonda?

742
00:48:57,935 --> 00:49:00,597
Oh, yeah. But, Mama,
I think that was her nerves.

743
00:49:00,837 --> 00:49:02,634
Threw up all down her dress.

744
00:49:04,608 --> 00:49:08,635
No, but Uncle Willy, now that was horrible.
Tell them.

745
00:49:08,779 --> 00:49:11,577
Heart attack,
walking his daughter down the aisle.

746
00:49:12,382 --> 00:49:14,145
Dropped dead right there. Bam!

747
00:49:14,251 --> 00:49:15,548
Oh, my...

748
00:49:18,221 --> 00:49:21,213
And Maggie.
Didn't she get assassinated at her wedding?

749
00:49:21,425 --> 00:49:23,825
- Assassinated?
- Yes.

750
00:49:25,228 --> 00:49:28,755
<i>On Falcon Crest.</i>

751
00:49:34,471 --> 00:49:36,905
Guess what happened
to my sister's wedding.

752
00:49:37,007 --> 00:49:39,737
- What?
- It got rained out.

753
00:49:44,548 --> 00:49:48,040
- So, Jessie...
- J.C.

754
00:49:48,151 --> 00:49:49,118
Aha.

755
00:49:49,286 --> 00:49:51,481
You fixing to wear white?

756
00:49:52,789 --> 00:49:54,086
Of course.

757
00:49:55,826 --> 00:49:59,489
Oh, honey, I know it's going to
be a beautiful wedding.

758
00:50:00,397 --> 00:50:02,797
- Oh, just beautiful!
Give me one wing.

759
00:50:09,306 --> 00:50:11,831
You're just going to throw it away, anyway.

760
00:50:11,942 --> 00:50:14,809
Yes. It will be beautiful.

761
00:50:18,281 --> 00:50:19,771
Give me one wing!

762
00:50:20,017 --> 00:50:21,109
JERRl: Sam!

763
00:50:22,386 --> 00:50:24,251
So, Michael, how's the team?

764
00:50:25,889 --> 00:50:28,483
Well, football's a tricky sport, as you know.

765
00:50:29,659 --> 00:50:32,150
But I feel good about
where we are as a team.

766
00:50:32,262 --> 00:50:35,356
I mean, we've got
a strong nucleus returning, you know.

767
00:50:35,999 --> 00:50:38,968
I mean, provided we protect the football,
stay penalty-free,

768
00:50:39,069 --> 00:50:41,333
I think we'll be in every game.

769
00:50:44,541 --> 00:50:50,502
Jay, so, you and Catherine
make kind of an odd couple,

770
00:50:51,114 --> 00:50:54,641
with her being such a catch and all.
I mean, no offense.

771
00:50:54,818 --> 00:50:56,149
None taken.

772
00:50:56,653 --> 00:50:59,918
I'm not trying to tell you what to do,
but I'd snatch her up real quick.

773
00:51:00,023 --> 00:51:02,014
You know what I'm saying?

774
00:51:02,993 --> 00:51:04,858
I'll see what I can do.

775
00:51:05,729 --> 00:51:08,220
Excuse me, I need to get some air.

776
00:51:09,332 --> 00:51:11,095
- But we're outside.
- Yeah, well.

777
00:51:11,201 --> 00:51:12,190
I'll join you.

778
00:51:13,370 --> 00:51:17,033
Like I said, it's about getting me
the football on time, you know?

779
00:51:17,307 --> 00:51:19,036
My statistics, they speak for themselves.

780
00:51:19,142 --> 00:51:23,670
It's like, if you want to win a football game,
who do you give the ball to? You know?

781
00:51:29,219 --> 00:51:31,449
Sorry about James. In-laws.

782
00:51:32,989 --> 00:51:34,752
Don't worry about it.

783
00:51:35,492 --> 00:51:37,119
But he's got a point, though.

784
00:51:37,294 --> 00:51:38,261
Huh?

785
00:51:38,395 --> 00:51:40,488
Jay, Catherine's quite a girl.

786
00:51:40,597 --> 00:51:44,533
She's smart, she's beautiful,
willing to put up with your quirks.

787
00:51:44,835 --> 00:51:47,235
- And the girl can write.
- Can she?

788
00:51:47,471 --> 00:51:48,995
You know she can.

789
00:51:49,172 --> 00:51:52,266
Actually, I haven't gotten around
to reading her book yet.

790
00:51:52,375 --> 00:51:54,206
What? Are you serious?

791
00:51:54,778 --> 00:51:58,305
Look, I didn't want to read it and hate it
and have everything fall apart.

792
00:51:58,415 --> 00:52:00,645
It's just as well.
Things aren't so peachy, anyway.

793
00:52:00,750 --> 00:52:03,719
Could have fooled me.
You seem great together.

794
00:52:05,455 --> 00:52:06,422
Whoopsie.

795
00:52:07,624 --> 00:52:10,991
Look, man, I don't know if I'm ready
for the end of my natural born bachelor life.

796
00:52:11,094 --> 00:52:12,959
All this was so sudden.

797
00:52:13,497 --> 00:52:14,828
You're an idiot.

798
00:52:14,931 --> 00:52:17,297
No, man, I'm telling you,
my spidey sense is telling me

799
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:18,389
I'm doing the right thing.

800
00:52:18,502 --> 00:52:22,529
No, your spidey sense is
what got you where you are now.

801
00:52:24,908 --> 00:52:26,307
I know myself too well.

802
00:52:26,409 --> 00:52:29,105
Look, I'll read the book,
overthink the whole thing.

803
00:52:29,212 --> 00:52:32,477
I don't want the breakup to be
about me not liking her book.

804
00:52:33,116 --> 00:52:36,279
You know, just let the pieces
fall where they may. See?

805
00:52:36,386 --> 00:52:38,513
No, but do you see it?

806
00:52:39,523 --> 00:52:43,926
Because what I see is the fact that J.C.
Said something nice about you

807
00:52:44,027 --> 00:52:46,052
for the first time in four years.

808
00:52:46,163 --> 00:52:48,631
You know why? Because of Catherine.

809
00:52:48,965 --> 00:52:51,661
Jay, you fuck this up,
we're back to square one.

810
00:52:51,868 --> 00:52:54,837
You know what that is? That's you
trolling the Internet for black singles,

811
00:52:54,938 --> 00:52:57,463
and me trying to sneak out of the house
so we can hang.

812
00:53:00,110 --> 00:53:02,977
- I got a handle on it.
- You better.

813
00:53:09,853 --> 00:53:13,118
I just got tired of drawing
the same old characters.

814
00:53:16,059 --> 00:53:18,220
- Done. What do you think?
- Let's see.

815
00:53:19,129 --> 00:53:24,396
Wow! Oh, I love her.
She's cute! Yay! Thank you.

816
00:53:26,269 --> 00:53:27,793
What's this thing?

817
00:53:28,605 --> 00:53:30,334
When I first started art school,

818
00:53:30,440 --> 00:53:33,773
we had an assignment
to draw something from our lives.

819
00:53:33,877 --> 00:53:37,244
And I started chronicling my dating woes
and just never stopped.

820
00:53:37,347 --> 00:53:40,180
- Okay, wait, so that means it's a journal.
- Something like...

821
00:53:40,283 --> 00:53:43,582
Like. Easy, easy, easy.

822
00:53:45,388 --> 00:53:46,616
Double point.

823
00:53:49,426 --> 00:53:51,257
I still like you, but no.

824
00:53:51,361 --> 00:53:54,353
- But no.
- Okay, fine.

825
00:53:54,464 --> 00:53:57,160
So, when do I get to
introduce you to the ocean?

826
00:53:57,367 --> 00:53:59,665
- Black men don't swim.
- What?

827
00:53:59,769 --> 00:54:01,828
It's right up there with camping.

828
00:54:02,038 --> 00:54:05,405
Okay, so this means you can dance now.
And that you like to play basketball.

829
00:54:05,508 --> 00:54:10,343
Okay, point taken. How about this?
It's just not superhero enough.

830
00:54:13,583 --> 00:54:14,641
No. See, that doesn't work.

831
00:54:14,751 --> 00:54:17,652
Because, you know, the best superheroes?
They totally work undercover.

832
00:54:17,754 --> 00:54:19,517
They do whatever it takes to save your life.

833
00:54:19,623 --> 00:54:22,023
- Did you say undercover?
- I did.

834
00:54:24,094 --> 00:54:27,359
- You said undercover.
- Undercover.

835
00:54:27,831 --> 00:54:29,696
- Let's get undercover.
- Undercover.

836
00:54:43,246 --> 00:54:45,214
- Hey, Molly!
- Hey!

837
00:54:45,649 --> 00:54:48,209
I had a question about
some of the inventory.

838
00:54:48,318 --> 00:54:50,252
That's more Sigmund's department.

839
00:54:50,353 --> 00:54:54,187
Yeah, I just didn't want to bother him,
since I'm new.

840
00:54:58,495 --> 00:55:00,360
What are you reading?

841
00:55:02,599 --> 00:55:05,363
This new book by this woman,
Catherine Williamson.

842
00:55:05,635 --> 00:55:07,603
- Really.
- Yeah, it's good.

843
00:55:07,704 --> 00:55:11,231
- It's very feminine, funny. It's different.
- I know her.

844
00:55:11,908 --> 00:55:14,001
- No way.
- Seriously. She's dating my best friend.

845
00:55:14,110 --> 00:55:17,102
Oh, my God!
She's getting to be really famous, you know.

846
00:55:17,213 --> 00:55:20,080
Really? She's really cool, humble.

847
00:55:20,250 --> 00:55:23,811
You know what?
You should get her to do a reading here.

848
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:27,549
I mean we do in-stores all the time,
but rarely for authors. It'd be huge.

849
00:55:27,657 --> 00:55:28,715
She might be kind of busy.

850
00:55:28,825 --> 00:55:32,591
Oh, come on. I'm sure she's doing stuff
at all the commercial bookstores.

851
00:55:32,696 --> 00:55:36,894
- Think of how cool it'd be.
- I could ask her.

852
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:40,163
- Yeah? You're amazing.
- Right on.

853
00:55:40,270 --> 00:55:42,329
- I'm gonna go tell Sigmund.
- Okay.

854
00:55:47,877 --> 00:55:52,814
No! The most I could possibly do would be,
like, maybe a signing, but no readings.

855
00:55:53,383 --> 00:55:56,546
Okay, it's just, I kind of promised a reading.

856
00:55:56,653 --> 00:55:58,348
Then you're, like, kind of out of luck.

857
00:55:58,455 --> 00:56:00,616
Think how punk rock it'll be. Yeah?

858
00:56:03,159 --> 00:56:04,786
Dude, help me out.

859
00:56:05,862 --> 00:56:08,524
Cath, why don't you think about...
Babe, get the plasma rifle.

860
00:56:08,631 --> 00:56:10,462
- Grab the plasma rifle, babe.
- I can't.

861
00:56:10,567 --> 00:56:13,627
No, just stand over it and press X. Dude!

862
00:56:13,737 --> 00:56:16,934
- It's not that. I told you, I can't do readings.
- Why?

863
00:56:18,208 --> 00:56:21,541
She thinks people will think
she sounds like a Valley girl.

864
00:56:21,711 --> 00:56:23,508
- That's why you won't read?
- Yeah!

865
00:56:23,613 --> 00:56:27,413
<i>I can totally see the review of books
for The New York Times. Yeah.</i>

866
00:56:27,517 --> 00:56:29,747
"Williamson, like, totally overrated. "

867
00:56:29,853 --> 00:56:31,582
Can I share something with you? Okay.

868
00:56:31,688 --> 00:56:33,747
For me, recently,
stepping outside of my comfort zone

869
00:56:33,857 --> 00:56:39,762
has been one of the most interesting
and growth-oriented experiences of my life.

870
00:56:39,863 --> 00:56:40,852
Word.

871
00:56:40,964 --> 00:56:43,524
Babe, look. Who cares what they think?

872
00:56:43,833 --> 00:56:47,291
<i>All right? Fuck The New York Times
review of whatever.</i>

873
00:56:47,404 --> 00:56:50,737
- Fuck them. Fuck whoever.
- Yeah, "Fuck tha police!"

874
00:56:58,381 --> 00:57:01,908
- Babe, you like the book, right?
- Of course.

875
00:57:02,018 --> 00:57:03,076
That's all that matters.

876
00:57:03,186 --> 00:57:06,383
Just open up your mouth
and let the book speak for itself.

877
00:57:07,123 --> 00:57:08,715
I believe in you.

878
00:57:12,195 --> 00:57:13,184
Oh!

879
00:57:13,296 --> 00:57:17,198
Okay, then. I'll do it.

880
00:57:17,300 --> 00:57:19,461
Yes! Yeah.

881
00:57:19,903 --> 00:57:22,804
Only if you promise you'll come out
dancing with Jay and me after the reading.

882
00:57:22,906 --> 00:57:26,273
You're on. You got it, definitely.
Thank you. Thank you.

883
00:57:31,047 --> 00:57:36,144
Babe, I should totally put in at least
one more hour today before we grab lunch.

884
00:57:37,187 --> 00:57:39,348
One more hour, I promise.

885
00:57:39,456 --> 00:57:44,325
Books don't write themselves.
So, I'm gonna be in the car.

886
00:57:44,794 --> 00:57:47,490
- I'm coming.
- Okay.

887
00:57:51,835 --> 00:57:54,326
Okay. Totally out of line.

888
00:57:55,872 --> 00:57:58,432
Dude, I had to ask her. Molly made me.

889
00:57:58,608 --> 00:58:00,599
Matt, you told her we'd go dancing!

890
00:58:00,710 --> 00:58:05,010
Dude, she told me! I had to say yes,
my ass is on the line with Molly.

891
00:58:05,114 --> 00:58:07,139
Your ass? If she bombs up there,

892
00:58:07,250 --> 00:58:11,243
she's going to blame me for talking her
into getting into it in the first place!

893
00:58:11,354 --> 00:58:14,016
She's only been seeing a head shrinker
for that exact problem for, like,

894
00:58:14,123 --> 00:58:15,283
the last million years!

895
00:58:15,391 --> 00:58:16,585
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

896
00:58:16,693 --> 00:58:19,184
You shouldn't have convinced her, then.

897
00:58:19,295 --> 00:58:20,489
Uncool, Matt.

898
00:58:20,597 --> 00:58:22,861
- Kidding.
- This totally screws me.

899
00:58:22,966 --> 00:58:26,527
I'm totally kidding.
Yo, why you tripping, man?

900
00:58:31,274 --> 00:58:33,242
So, come here for a sec.

901
00:58:34,110 --> 00:58:37,045
A friend of mine was
going to scrap this for parts,

902
00:58:37,714 --> 00:58:41,206
but I convinced him to give it to me for you.

903
00:58:43,786 --> 00:58:45,947
Cath, you can't buy me a car!

904
00:58:46,322 --> 00:58:48,620
In fact, I don't need you
to buy me anything else!

905
00:58:48,725 --> 00:58:51,455
I actually like my life exactly the way it is.

906
00:58:52,862 --> 00:58:55,956
Jay, it's not like I don't get
anything out of the deal.

907
00:58:56,332 --> 00:59:00,564
I mean, do you think I like shuttling you
back and forth all the time?

908
00:59:01,204 --> 00:59:03,604
God, you're really something else.

909
00:59:05,241 --> 00:59:08,904
Actually, I have a ton of work
I should be doing right now.

910
00:59:09,212 --> 00:59:11,077
So, wait, you're not gonna come in?

911
00:59:11,180 --> 00:59:14,809
- I really shouldn't.
- I think you should. Okay?

912
00:59:21,257 --> 00:59:22,622
Okay.

913
00:59:34,137 --> 00:59:37,595
Okay, so, one more surprise.

914
00:59:37,707 --> 00:59:40,267
Last one of the day, I swear. Okay?

915
00:59:41,411 --> 00:59:42,503
What's this?

916
00:59:42,612 --> 00:59:44,603
I got J.C. To set up a meeting with you,

917
00:59:44,714 --> 00:59:47,945
with some folks
for publishing your graphic novel.

918
00:59:51,154 --> 00:59:55,818
Okay, don't say anything, please.
I'm just merely helping out. You know.

919
00:59:55,925 --> 00:59:58,416
I really think you could
take it to the next level, is all.

920
00:59:58,528 --> 01:00:00,291
I'm going to go, and I'm going to work,

921
01:00:00,396 --> 01:00:03,263
and then we'll grab lunch
in, like, an hour, okay?

922
01:00:03,633 --> 01:00:05,123
Yeah, no sweat.

923
01:01:00,623 --> 01:01:02,557
What are you doing here?

924
01:01:05,228 --> 01:01:06,490
Jay?

925
01:01:06,596 --> 01:01:11,465
Oh, yes! I got the rifle, bro. Level seven!

926
01:01:12,435 --> 01:01:14,369
Where's Catherine?

927
01:01:17,607 --> 01:01:19,507
Jay, where's Catherine?

928
01:01:25,915 --> 01:01:29,214
Jay? What's up, man?

929
01:01:32,021 --> 01:01:35,252
Oh, no, you didn't leave her a letter,
did you?

930
01:01:37,026 --> 01:01:38,721
Are you kidding me?

931
01:01:39,562 --> 01:01:42,998
Dude, I'm literally doing backflips
trying to make some time with Molly,

932
01:01:43,099 --> 01:01:45,192
and you call it quits with an amazing girl?

933
01:01:45,301 --> 01:01:47,599
Yo, asshole! Hello, look, Jay...

934
01:01:48,004 --> 01:01:52,566
All I'm saying is
it was a gift for you to meet her, okay?

935
01:01:52,675 --> 01:01:55,940
With all the bullshit
you put women through, you know?

936
01:01:56,045 --> 01:01:59,742
If she's not the one, man,
I don't know who is.

937
01:02:17,667 --> 01:02:18,759
Shit!

938
01:03:06,349 --> 01:03:09,477
- Boo!
- Hey! Don't do that.

939
01:03:09,585 --> 01:03:10,609
Sorry. Where'd you go?

940
01:03:10,720 --> 01:03:15,248
I went out to get you a plant and forgot
to leave myself a way to get back in.

941
01:03:15,725 --> 01:03:17,590
Wow, sweet. From my garden?

942
01:03:20,163 --> 01:03:21,494
Hey, uh...

943
01:03:21,597 --> 01:03:26,227
Why don't you go back in the kitchen,
get yourself a drink,

944
01:03:26,335 --> 01:03:28,303
make yourself more comfortable?

945
01:03:30,106 --> 01:03:31,937
You're so weird.

946
01:03:39,749 --> 01:03:45,210
All right. Hold that thought.
Hold that thought, I'll be right back. Okay?

947
01:03:51,994 --> 01:03:52,961
All right.

948
01:03:53,696 --> 01:03:54,663
Oh, no, Jay.

949
01:03:54,797 --> 01:03:56,958
No, Jay, Jay, Jay, Jay, Jay, Jay.

950
01:03:59,836 --> 01:04:01,303
Okay, okay, okay.

951
01:04:07,743 --> 01:04:10,405
- I can explain.
- Okay.

952
01:04:11,013 --> 01:04:15,950
Wait. Well, give me a second.
I wasn't really ready for that.

953
01:04:16,052 --> 01:04:20,512
- Were you just going to leave?
- No. Well, yes, I was.

954
01:04:20,623 --> 01:04:23,717
But, but, I didn't.

955
01:04:24,727 --> 01:04:27,719
- You did.
- Yes, but I came back.

956
01:04:29,799 --> 01:04:34,361
Look, okay, everything was going so great
with you and I

957
01:04:34,770 --> 01:04:37,000
that I panicked. All right?

958
01:04:37,106 --> 01:04:39,404
But that was the old me.

959
01:04:39,609 --> 01:04:42,237
The old me was always
looking for conspiracies.

960
01:04:42,645 --> 01:04:45,079
I still don't know
why you spend money on me.

961
01:04:45,181 --> 01:04:46,671
I have no idea.

962
01:04:47,516 --> 01:04:50,076
The old me was afraid of commitment.

963
01:04:52,154 --> 01:04:57,387
Okay, check this out, the old me was
so worried that he wouldn't like your book,

964
01:04:57,493 --> 01:05:02,192
thus ruining the relationship forever,
that he never even bothered to read it.

965
01:05:02,298 --> 01:05:06,200
The old me was insensitive
and insecure and...

966
01:05:06,335 --> 01:05:07,996
Wait, did you really not read my book?

967
01:05:08,104 --> 01:05:10,334
Well, no, no, no.
The old me never read your book.

968
01:05:10,439 --> 01:05:12,464
The new me is going to get to it
as soon as he can.

969
01:05:12,575 --> 01:05:14,372
So you never read my book?

970
01:05:15,778 --> 01:05:18,246
Technically, no.

971
01:05:25,621 --> 01:05:29,148
You know, I just agreed to read out loud

972
01:05:29,258 --> 01:05:31,692
in front of a whole crapload of people
I've never met,

973
01:05:31,794 --> 01:05:35,457
and the guy who's most responsible
for getting me in this mess

974
01:05:35,564 --> 01:05:37,054
hasn't read my book.

975
01:05:37,166 --> 01:05:38,963
What happened to facing your fears?

976
01:05:39,068 --> 01:05:42,196
I know. I know, it doesn't make any sense,

977
01:05:43,472 --> 01:05:46,032
but if you think about it, like,

978
01:05:46,142 --> 01:05:50,602
in a glass-is-half-empty kind of way,
I was doing it for us.

979
01:05:50,947 --> 01:05:54,439
Wow. I feel so fricking retarded.

980
01:05:54,850 --> 01:05:56,408
J.C. Warned me about this.

981
01:05:56,519 --> 01:05:59,454
- Operation Brown Sugar.
- No! No, no, no, no, no, no.

982
01:05:59,555 --> 01:06:02,786
No! Cath, come on. Come on, no!

983
01:06:02,925 --> 01:06:07,191
Look, I thought it was about race, all right?
But I was wrong.

984
01:06:07,863 --> 01:06:13,062
Okay? I thought that all the white girls
were crazy and so I set out to...

985
01:06:17,974 --> 01:06:19,202
I thought...

986
01:06:24,847 --> 01:06:26,280
I thought all...

987
01:06:27,316 --> 01:06:28,840
I thought all the white girls were crazy,

988
01:06:28,951 --> 01:06:31,476
so I set out to find
the right black woman for me,

989
01:06:31,587 --> 01:06:33,179
but they were all wrong, too.

990
01:06:33,289 --> 01:06:34,688
So, I'm like a happy medium
or something, right?

991
01:06:34,790 --> 01:06:38,556
No, no, no.
Look, I know that this sounds bad.

992
01:06:38,661 --> 01:06:40,128
Yeah, it does.

993
01:06:40,730 --> 01:06:44,461
God! I just feel, like, you know what?
I need some time to think.

994
01:06:44,567 --> 01:06:46,330
Okay. Okay, good.

995
01:06:46,469 --> 01:06:50,963
Good, hey, you take some time. Think away.

996
01:06:51,073 --> 01:06:56,010
I'm going to be right over here,
reading your book.

997
01:06:56,479 --> 01:06:58,743
- Right?
- Okay, no, actually, no.

998
01:06:59,181 --> 01:07:01,240
I need some time alone.

999
01:07:07,223 --> 01:07:10,351
Okay. That's cool, too.

1000
01:07:12,695 --> 01:07:14,060
No pressure.

1001
01:07:14,864 --> 01:07:20,200
So we'll talk, like, tomorrow or whatever?

1002
01:07:20,970 --> 01:07:22,198
Bye, Jay.

1003
01:07:23,773 --> 01:07:26,173
I know we can make this work, Cath.

1004
01:07:28,511 --> 01:07:29,978
I know we can.

1005
01:08:11,320 --> 01:08:13,185
Hey, Cath, it's me.

1006
01:08:13,689 --> 01:08:17,955
I know I was supposed to wait for your call,
but it's been over a week, so

1007
01:08:18,194 --> 01:08:21,391
I wanted to call back and say hi. So, hi!

1008
01:08:22,231 --> 01:08:25,860
Hey, I finished the book. It's great!
I have some notes on it.

1009
01:08:26,402 --> 01:08:27,699
That was a joke.

1010
01:08:27,803 --> 01:08:29,737
Because you remember
when we first went out,

1011
01:08:29,839 --> 01:08:32,307
you called me back with notes on our date?

1012
01:08:32,541 --> 01:08:34,031
That was funny.

1013
01:08:34,577 --> 01:08:35,544
Well...

1014
01:08:37,246 --> 01:08:42,047
<i>Please, baby, please, baby.
Baby, baby, please, give me a call, okay?</i>

1015
01:08:43,486 --> 01:08:45,215
<i>That's another joke.</i>

1016
01:08:46,021 --> 01:08:47,318
<i>So call me.</i>

1017
01:09:21,891 --> 01:09:24,951
Thanks for coming
to our humble establishment.

1018
01:09:25,594 --> 01:09:28,722
Tonight, it is my pleasure to present

1019
01:09:28,998 --> 01:09:33,765
the first of what I hope will be many
appearances here, Catherine Williamson.

1020
01:09:40,309 --> 01:09:46,373
Wow, it's totally insane to think that
a bunch of you have actually read my book.

1021
01:09:49,451 --> 01:09:54,286
<i>The Inevitable Was Bound To Happen,
by Catherine Williamson.</i>

1022
01:09:59,995 --> 01:10:03,863
"The inevitable, being inevitable,
was bound to happen...

1023
01:10:05,167 --> 01:10:09,433
"So, as it happens, does fate. "

1024
01:10:09,872 --> 01:10:13,706
Yo, player. Not so good.

1025
01:10:13,809 --> 01:10:17,870
She wouldn't even take it from me. Sorry.

1026
01:10:27,256 --> 01:10:31,659
"It was the sort of kind of time,
where the weather didn't match the season.

1027
01:10:31,760 --> 01:10:35,662
"And the hearts of the people
didn't match their minds.

1028
01:10:35,764 --> 01:10:37,356
"Gunnar was alone. "

1029
01:10:51,981 --> 01:10:52,948
Frick.

1030
01:10:57,753 --> 01:11:01,086
So, are you going to apologize
for walking out on me

1031
01:11:05,694 --> 01:11:07,559
for no fricking reason?

1032
01:11:09,965 --> 01:11:12,365
I've been over it, again and again.

1033
01:11:13,168 --> 01:11:15,102
I just want to know why.

1034
01:11:21,510 --> 01:11:24,707
You left when I said
you look like Gary Coleman.

1035
01:11:25,014 --> 01:11:27,380
- Well, I don't!
- It was a joke.

1036
01:11:28,284 --> 01:11:29,945
You should know better than to go around

1037
01:11:30,052 --> 01:11:32,577
telling black people
they look like famous black people.

1038
01:11:32,688 --> 01:11:34,451
We're very sensitive about that!

1039
01:11:34,556 --> 01:11:37,047
I didn't tell black people. I told you.

1040
01:11:38,394 --> 01:11:41,659
The guy I'd been fucking
for five and a half months.

1041
01:11:45,434 --> 01:11:47,800
Look, I'm not very good
with confrontation, Beth.

1042
01:11:47,903 --> 01:11:49,234
You know that.

1043
01:11:52,041 --> 01:11:54,737
It was just easier to blow you off.

1044
01:11:57,379 --> 01:11:58,641
I was stupid...

1045
01:11:59,682 --> 01:12:02,742
I was stupid about it, and I'm sorry.

1046
01:12:30,946 --> 01:12:37,010
Hey! So, I heard Sigmund promoted you
from the stockroom to the used section.

1047
01:12:37,252 --> 01:12:38,810
Yeah.

1048
01:12:38,921 --> 01:12:41,446
Well, we'll be able to see
each other more often, then.

1049
01:12:41,557 --> 01:12:43,047
- Cool.
- Cool.

1050
01:12:43,158 --> 01:12:44,921
All right, good night.

1051
01:12:45,861 --> 01:12:48,386
Hey, what are you doing this weekend?

1052
01:12:49,598 --> 01:12:54,058
Nothing. I mean,
I've got things, but nothing.

1053
01:12:54,169 --> 01:12:56,797
Well, there's this band playing
in Silver Lake,

1054
01:12:58,440 --> 01:13:02,308
and my boyfriend and I are going,
and there's this girl, Diane,

1055
01:13:02,411 --> 01:13:05,437
who I think would be totally up your alley.

1056
01:13:05,547 --> 01:13:08,744
I mean, she's completely into hip-hop,
just like you.

1057
01:13:09,685 --> 01:13:11,414
It'll be great. I'll call you.

1058
01:13:11,520 --> 01:13:14,546
Okay. That'll be dope.

1059
01:13:37,513 --> 01:13:41,574
- Did you forget to hire the damn strippers?
- Don't tell the guys.

1060
01:13:43,585 --> 01:13:46,076
They're going to figure it out.

1061
01:13:52,494 --> 01:13:56,191
Gentlemen, let's say we kick things off
at the Seventh Veil.

1062
01:13:59,001 --> 01:14:00,434
All right?

1063
01:14:02,337 --> 01:14:04,862
- Thanks.
- So did you call her?

1064
01:14:04,973 --> 01:14:06,235
Many times.

1065
01:14:06,341 --> 01:14:09,208
But you know J.C. Invited her
to the wedding tomorrow, too.

1066
01:14:09,311 --> 01:14:10,539
So?

1067
01:14:10,712 --> 01:14:12,373
I'm over her, anyway.

1068
01:14:12,481 --> 01:14:15,746
And this from a guy who hasn't left
his house in four weeks?

1069
01:14:16,618 --> 01:14:18,108
Now, Jay, you know what I'm saying.

1070
01:14:18,220 --> 01:14:21,849
It's not about color or class
or any of that shit, man.

1071
01:14:22,024 --> 01:14:24,822
And you know it.
You're just afraid to commit.

1072
01:14:25,194 --> 01:14:29,392
Now, if you want to continue being
in this situation forever, be my guest.

1073
01:14:30,199 --> 01:14:33,600
But I'm pulling for you to find somebody
that you love so much,

1074
01:14:33,702 --> 01:14:35,567
you can't even help it.

1075
01:14:35,971 --> 01:14:36,960
Are y'all coming or what?

1076
01:14:37,072 --> 01:14:40,166
I know a bomb Puerto Rican
named Candy Cane.

1077
01:14:41,710 --> 01:14:44,372
All right, man, we'll be there in a minute.

1078
01:14:44,580 --> 01:14:48,778
Hey! Who likes white meat? Come on, man.

1079
01:14:52,087 --> 01:14:54,112
Your family.

1080
01:14:55,224 --> 01:14:56,213
Come on, man.

1081
01:14:57,493 --> 01:15:00,223
Yeah, man, never better.
- Not after last night.

1082
01:15:00,329 --> 01:15:02,524
What was her name, Cinnamon?

1083
01:15:02,631 --> 01:15:04,997
- I don't know. Speak no evil.
- Spice?

1084
01:15:05,100 --> 01:15:06,590
I was a good boy.

1085
01:15:06,702 --> 01:15:07,726
Come on, quit it!

1086
01:15:07,836 --> 01:15:09,997
Oh, yeah. Our time to meddle.

1087
01:15:10,105 --> 01:15:11,834
- Jay!
- What's up Q-Tip?

1088
01:15:11,940 --> 01:15:13,703
Looking spifferifous.

1089
01:15:14,142 --> 01:15:16,804
- Hey, bro!
- What's up, baby?

1090
01:15:16,912 --> 01:15:19,745
- Congratulations, man.
- Thanks, Matty.

1091
01:15:19,848 --> 01:15:22,146
Oh, hell, no!

1092
01:15:22,251 --> 01:15:24,219
Don't look. You don't want to see this.

1093
01:15:24,319 --> 01:15:25,684
Listen up, Negroes.

1094
01:15:25,854 --> 01:15:31,121
I don't know how you people get married
in the projects, but here, it's a solemn event.

1095
01:15:31,226 --> 01:15:32,750
Actually, you do want to see this.

1096
01:15:32,861 --> 01:15:35,659
And if you think you all take your
ghetto asses one foot inside that church

1097
01:15:35,764 --> 01:15:39,530
while you're drunk,
you got another thing coming.

1098
01:15:39,801 --> 01:15:40,768
Uh-huh.

1099
01:15:43,872 --> 01:15:45,999
- It's pop, J.C.
- Yeah.

1100
01:15:46,308 --> 01:15:48,105
That's soda?

1101
01:15:48,477 --> 01:15:49,739
- Well, it was in a bag.
- That's soda?

1102
01:15:49,845 --> 01:15:51,244
Isn't it an open bar, anyway?

1103
01:15:52,648 --> 01:15:55,742
- Yes, it's going to be an open bar.
- Word.

1104
01:15:56,385 --> 01:15:59,013
Well, then, y'all just carry on, then.
I'm sorry.

1105
01:15:59,121 --> 01:16:00,679
- We didn't know.
- Anyway...

1106
01:16:01,690 --> 01:16:06,957
- Oh, my God! There's Drake!
- Drake! Don't look at me!

1107
01:16:07,062 --> 01:16:10,122
- I don't want him to see me, girl!
- Drake, dawg! Man, your girl is ghetto!

1108
01:16:10,232 --> 01:16:13,861
- I mean pickles and Tootsie Pops, dawg!
- Right.

1109
01:16:13,969 --> 01:16:15,869
What the heck is her problem, anyway?

1110
01:16:15,971 --> 01:16:18,371
<i>I now pronounce you man and wife.</i>

1111
01:16:26,949 --> 01:16:28,940
May I have your attention.

1112
01:16:29,084 --> 01:16:33,316
A father usually goes through
a lot of emotions when

1113
01:16:33,722 --> 01:16:35,587
his only daughter brings home

1114
01:16:36,124 --> 01:16:39,252
the man that she's going to
spend the rest of her life with.

1115
01:16:39,361 --> 01:16:42,421
But I'm on these antidepressants now, so

1116
01:16:42,798 --> 01:16:45,824
I'm pretty even-keeled,
no matter the situation.

1117
01:16:50,238 --> 01:16:56,234
But still, I think that it's mostly joy
that I'm feeling about

1118
01:16:57,045 --> 01:17:01,948
Drake becoming a member of my family.

1119
01:17:03,318 --> 01:17:05,809
So let us toast

1120
01:17:06,421 --> 01:17:09,185
to the joining of the Moores and the Evans,

1121
01:17:09,992 --> 01:17:12,426
a match made in...

1122
01:17:16,665 --> 01:17:18,724
We'll just have to see, won't we?

1123
01:17:19,935 --> 01:17:21,903
A word from the best man.

1124
01:17:25,974 --> 01:17:27,703
Thank you, Mr. Evans.

1125
01:17:30,278 --> 01:17:33,839
I've known Drake
since we were both dressing up

1126
01:17:33,949 --> 01:17:36,611
like Lando Calrissian for Halloween.

1127
01:17:37,285 --> 01:17:40,584
As a matter of fact,
I'm the one who got him into sci-fi,

1128
01:17:41,523 --> 01:17:45,653
a childhood hobby
I'm sure he won't fess up to now.

1129
01:17:46,128 --> 01:17:47,095
Shh.

1130
01:17:47,963 --> 01:17:50,591
It's not as easy as it used to be

1131
01:17:51,667 --> 01:17:54,864
to tell when you're making
a difference in someone's life,

1132
01:17:54,970 --> 01:17:58,906
but believe me, it can be done.

1133
01:18:00,976 --> 01:18:02,967
You've been great for him.

1134
01:18:04,579 --> 01:18:10,779
It's a rare day when you meet
someone special to you.

1135
01:18:12,354 --> 01:18:18,384
Drake and J.C. Inspired me
when they dared to love each other.

1136
01:18:19,294 --> 01:18:24,095
I only hope I can one day
have what they have.

1137
01:18:27,903 --> 01:18:29,837
Anyway.

1138
01:18:31,673 --> 01:18:35,336
- To Drake and J.C.
- Thank you.

1139
01:19:05,207 --> 01:19:10,167
Is that a smile? Big smile?
You work on the smile, okay?

1140
01:19:12,914 --> 01:19:14,074
Hello.

1141
01:19:14,583 --> 01:19:16,016
- Hi!
- What's up?

1142
01:19:19,121 --> 01:19:20,554
That's my jam!

1143
01:19:20,689 --> 01:19:24,318
Would you care to experience
the Caucasian sensation?

1144
01:19:24,426 --> 01:19:26,121
- All right. Let's go.
- Cool.

1145
01:19:46,448 --> 01:19:49,747
- So you gonna dance?
- I don't dance.

1146
01:19:51,086 --> 01:19:54,852
Well, if you're not dancing
'cause of that girl, it's your own fault.

1147
01:19:55,557 --> 01:19:57,889
You and her had something. I could tell.

1148
01:19:58,326 --> 01:20:01,420
You just can't let something like that
get away from you.

1149
01:20:01,530 --> 01:20:04,294
When I was a girl, I was seeing this boy...

1150
01:20:04,399 --> 01:20:06,799
Let me guess. Everything was really great.

1151
01:20:06,902 --> 01:20:09,166
You two had something,
but it didn't work out

1152
01:20:09,271 --> 01:20:11,364
on account of you passing for white.

1153
01:20:11,473 --> 01:20:13,304
I know how black I am!

1154
01:20:14,209 --> 01:20:17,610
I just say all that nonsense
and act the fool to mess with y'all.

1155
01:20:17,712 --> 01:20:19,771
Now, don't interrupt me.

1156
01:20:21,550 --> 01:20:23,415
I was seeing this boy.

1157
01:20:24,019 --> 01:20:29,116
He got shipped off to Korea
just when we were getting close.

1158
01:20:29,958 --> 01:20:35,919
Well, when he come back,
I was already married to Drake's grandfather,

1159
01:20:36,998 --> 01:20:38,795
God rest his soul.

1160
01:20:40,035 --> 01:20:43,163
Even though I love that man,

1161
01:20:44,439 --> 01:20:47,602
I couldn't help but wonder, still,

1162
01:20:49,878 --> 01:20:51,641
what would have been.

1163
01:20:54,783 --> 01:20:56,080
I'm sorry.

1164
01:20:57,152 --> 01:20:58,744
It's okay.

1165
01:21:00,322 --> 01:21:04,224
You're young enough
where you can get to my age

1166
01:21:04,326 --> 01:21:08,456
without having any regrets,
if you play your cards right.

1167
01:21:08,997 --> 01:21:11,591
Now get on out there and dance, boy.

1168
01:21:11,700 --> 01:21:16,694
I'm old and I want to see you
make a fool of yourself before I

1169
01:21:17,806 --> 01:21:19,000
die.

1170
01:21:19,107 --> 01:21:22,042
Hello, sugar? Get on, now!

1171
01:21:22,143 --> 01:21:24,407
- How you doing?
- I'm all right, how are you?

1172
01:21:24,512 --> 01:21:26,446
I'm doing fair to middling.

1173
01:21:26,548 --> 01:21:28,607
You want to get out there
and let me show you a few moves,

1174
01:21:28,717 --> 01:21:31,015
let me see a couple of yours?

1175
01:21:31,119 --> 01:21:33,519
- Come on.
- All right, now.

1176
01:22:08,924 --> 01:22:11,825
<i>Sorry, Drake and J.C.,</i>

1177
01:22:11,927 --> 01:22:15,294
<i>but you'll understand later.</i>

1178
01:22:22,237 --> 01:22:26,867
<i>Please, please, please, please</i>

1179
01:22:28,243 --> 01:22:30,507
<i>Please me</i>

1180
01:22:30,679 --> 01:22:34,240
<i>You don't have to go</i>

1181
01:22:36,117 --> 01:22:42,317
<i>Baby, please, baby, please, please me</i>

1182
01:22:43,191 --> 01:22:47,491
<i>You don't have to go</i>

1183
01:22:47,595 --> 01:22:51,588
<i>You know you broke my heart</i>

1184
01:22:52,500 --> 01:22:54,991
<i>when you went away</i>

1185
01:23:13,588 --> 01:23:15,681
Okay, you are so totally out of your mind.

1186
01:23:15,790 --> 01:23:17,257
Hey, you knew that from day one.

1187
01:23:17,359 --> 01:23:19,827
Look, I've been trying to talk to you
all day long.

1188
01:23:19,928 --> 01:23:22,226
Okay, so, what? This is, like,
your way of getting my attention, right?

1189
01:23:22,330 --> 01:23:25,629
- Hey, nobody begs like the Godfather.
- I beg to differ.

1190
01:23:25,734 --> 01:23:27,861
- So, who's the goon?
- Oh, God!

1191
01:23:27,969 --> 01:23:31,166
All right, all right. I know it's inappropriate.

1192
01:23:31,272 --> 01:23:32,864
So, what, are you two
an item or something?

1193
01:23:32,974 --> 01:23:35,807
No, don't even tell me. I don't want to know.

1194
01:23:37,746 --> 01:23:39,509
So... Here.

1195
01:23:40,782 --> 01:23:42,909
So, hey, how've you been?

1196
01:23:43,718 --> 01:23:45,345
Good. Busy, but really good.

1197
01:23:45,453 --> 01:23:47,387
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1198
01:23:47,489 --> 01:23:49,218
You're famous, you know.

1199
01:23:49,324 --> 01:23:51,918
I know. It's a phase. It'll just pass.

1200
01:23:52,127 --> 01:23:53,492
Cath, why haven't you called me?

1201
01:23:53,595 --> 01:23:56,860
I don't know. I just...
I was mad at first, okay?

1202
01:23:58,500 --> 01:24:01,833
Then, I guess, I went out of town,
and finally, I don't know,

1203
01:24:01,936 --> 01:24:03,665
it just was easier not to call.

1204
01:24:03,772 --> 01:24:07,503
Well, would you take me back if I told you
I was seeking professional help?

1205
01:24:08,176 --> 01:24:09,803
You're in therapy?

1206
01:24:10,011 --> 01:24:13,242
Well, no, unless it would help,
and then, well,

1207
01:24:13,348 --> 01:24:14,337
- still no.
- Okay.

1208
01:24:14,449 --> 01:24:17,145
Look, I just don't think
we had a good breakup.

1209
01:24:17,452 --> 01:24:19,477
I know, I know, coming from me that's like...

1210
01:24:19,587 --> 01:24:21,384
That's like karma to the nth degree.

1211
01:24:21,489 --> 01:24:24,219
But still, there was no real closure.

1212
01:24:24,759 --> 01:24:27,819
Hey, hey, hey! Did you miss me?

1213
01:24:27,929 --> 01:24:30,830
- Sorry, buddy.
- Okay, I didn't not miss you, all right?

1214
01:24:30,932 --> 01:24:32,229
"I didn't not miss you"?

1215
01:24:32,333 --> 01:24:35,632
I don't even know what that means,
but that alone is worth investigating.

1216
01:24:35,737 --> 01:24:38,729
What say we get out of here,
go find somewhere we can talk, okay?

1217
01:24:38,840 --> 01:24:41,673
- We can go to the beach. I'll drive.
- You'll drive?

1218
01:24:41,776 --> 01:24:44,745
Yeah, brother's got a ride now.
Come on, Cath, let's go!

1219
01:24:44,846 --> 01:24:46,973
Dishes. Come on!

1220
01:24:47,515 --> 01:24:48,573
Okay, nope.

1221
01:24:48,683 --> 01:24:50,878
- No?
- Yeah, no.

1222
01:24:50,985 --> 01:24:52,111
Jay, look, you really hurt me,

1223
01:24:52,220 --> 01:24:55,883
and while begging publicly
was definitely a start,

1224
01:24:56,024 --> 01:24:57,218
it just can't be that simple, I'm sorry.

1225
01:24:57,325 --> 01:25:00,522
Look, it can be that simple
if you want it to be that simple.

1226
01:25:16,244 --> 01:25:17,302
Catherine,

1227
01:25:20,482 --> 01:25:23,349
you don't wanna dance, do you?

1228
01:25:25,320 --> 01:25:28,153
Jay Brooks, are you asking me to dance?

1229
01:25:28,590 --> 01:25:31,650
Against my better judgment
and holding absolutely no regard

1230
01:25:31,759 --> 01:25:35,422
for the safety of any of those guests, yes.

1231
01:25:36,931 --> 01:25:39,331
I gotta start somewhere, right?

1232
01:25:41,069 --> 01:25:42,832
Okay, yes, you do.

1233
01:25:44,005 --> 01:25:46,496
<i>Run for cover if they play Y.M.C.A.</i>

1234
01:26:00,355 --> 01:26:01,322
Hey.

1235
01:26:11,466 --> 01:26:12,433
I'm fine.
