2
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:03,341
Jamie.
Hey.

3
00:01:03,563 --> 00:01:04,371
Hey.

4
00:01:04,631 --> 00:01:05,591
I need you to read this.

5
00:01:07,867 --> 00:01:11,781
Can you believe he texted me this?
In the middle of chem class.

6
00:01:13,339 --> 00:01:16,049
So are you gonna do it!
No.

7
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:20,618
Maybe.
Well, what about you?

8
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:24,221
You and Danny have any naughty plans
for your one year celebration?

9
00:01:24,484 --> 00:01:27,558
He's probably just gonna take
me to dinner or something.

10
00:01:27,821 --> 00:01:29,801
Yeah, is that what
you're hoping for?

11
00:01:30,023 --> 00:01:32,060
So what are you doing,
are you heading home?

12
00:01:32,325 --> 00:01:34,805
Soon. I'm gonna go say
goodbye to Ms. Cohen first.

13
00:01:35,028 --> 00:01:36,473
Oh, teacher's pet?

14
00:01:36,696 --> 00:01:38,573
All right, I'll see you
after practice, okay?

15
00:01:38,832 --> 00:01:40,311
Okay.

16
00:01:40,533 --> 00:01:42,535
- Bye.
- Bye.

17
00:01:44,604 --> 00:01:46,114
You are lucky.

18
00:01:48,104 --> 00:01:49,114
I know.

19
00:02:00,019 --> 00:02:01,498
Jamie!

20
00:02:01,721 --> 00:02:04,065
I was hoping I'd get
to see you before I left.

21
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:07,435
This is for you.
Oh, you didn't have to.

22
00:02:07,694 --> 00:02:09,332
Just a little something
for the baby.

23
00:02:09,562 --> 00:02:11,202
Besides, you've helped me
a lot this year.

24
00:02:11,397 --> 00:02:14,241
Jamie, you are gonna do great.

25
00:02:14,467 --> 00:02:15,673
Your marks are excellent,

26
00:02:15,935 --> 00:02:18,211
and if you just keep working
as hard as you have,

27
00:02:18,438 --> 00:02:20,239
you can get into whichever
college you choose.

28
00:02:21,274 --> 00:02:22,719
Even Whittendale?

29
00:02:22,942 --> 00:02:24,615
Even Whittendale.

30
00:02:26,746 --> 00:02:28,350
What about the new teacher?

31
00:02:28,581 --> 00:02:30,288
Oh, Miss Matson, don't worry,

32
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:32,751
I've heard she's great.
I'm sure you'll really like her.

33
00:03:08,821 --> 00:03:10,858
Let's go, man, you got it.

34
00:03:11,124 --> 00:03:15,530
Our school has always taken pride
in our extracurricular activities.

35
00:03:15,795 --> 00:03:20,805
Music, drama, but the
real feather in our cap...

36
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:23,047
is our baseball team.

37
00:03:23,102 --> 00:03:26,714
For eight seasons straight,
we've won the state championships.

38
00:03:26,973 --> 00:03:28,475
Wow.

39
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:32,450
Still though, it doesn't mean these
boys get any special treatment.

40
00:03:32,679 --> 00:03:36,217
They're all expected to
maintain a passing grade.

41
00:03:36,482 --> 00:03:38,758
If not, they're cut
from the team.

42
00:03:41,821 --> 00:03:46,500
Now, I'll be emailing you your
class list by the end of the day.

43
00:03:46,726 --> 00:03:49,366
And if there's anything else?

44
00:03:50,964 --> 00:03:52,944
No, I don't think so.

45
00:03:58,538 --> 00:03:59,642
Hey, dad.

46
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:01,374
Hey, Jamie.

47
00:04:03,009 --> 00:04:04,511
M, honey, how was school?

48
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:05,848
Okay.

49
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:07,615
How did dad's job interview go?

50
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:10,861
Uh, not so good.

51
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:13,564
Can you do me a favor and make
sure he gets some dinner?

52
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:15,493
I gotta go to work.

53
00:04:15,722 --> 00:04:18,900
So I guess this means I'm not getting
my cell phone back anytime soon.

54
00:04:19,158 --> 00:04:23,301
Jamie, you know we'd like
to be able to get you that.

55
00:04:23,429 --> 00:04:25,807
I know, we need
to cut back on expenses.

56
00:04:27,667 --> 00:04:28,873
What's that?

57
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:31,946
My application to Whittendale.

58
00:04:33,873 --> 00:04:35,716
Jamie, I need
to tell you something.

59
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:38,946
Your father and I,

60
00:04:39,212 --> 00:04:43,788
well, we had to borrow from the
college funds to pay for the house.

61
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:45,859
And the taxes
were six months overdue,

62
00:04:46,085 --> 00:04:47,926
and the bank was threatening
to take the house.

63
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:48,961
I don't believe this.

64
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:51,998
Jamie, I'm so sorry, but I'm
doing everything I can,

65
00:04:52,225 --> 00:04:54,330
by taking the two jobs
and your dad's out of work.

66
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,437
So what, I don't get
to go to college now?

67
00:04:56,696 --> 00:04:58,004
No.

68
00:04:58,231 --> 00:05:01,370
No, no, no, I promise you
we'll make back the money.

69
00:05:01,601 --> 00:05:02,409
How, mom?

70
00:05:05,104 --> 00:05:06,981
Where are you going?

71
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,742
Over to Danny's.

72
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:30,872
Danny, stop.

73
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:31,904
What?

74
00:05:32,131 --> 00:05:33,667
You know I'm not ready.

75
00:05:35,234 --> 00:05:37,612
I know.

76
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:43,984
Just promise me that when you
are ready, I'll be the one.

77
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:47,449
I promise.

78
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,523
Okay.

79
00:05:53,686 --> 00:05:55,723
You could knock first.

80
00:05:55,988 --> 00:05:57,968
I don't need to knock
in my own home.

81
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:01,936
Besides, shouldn't you two be
studying at your own house?

82
00:06:03,796 --> 00:06:05,070
I'll see you tomorrow.

83
00:06:05,298 --> 00:06:06,402
Okay.

84
00:06:10,937 --> 00:06:12,075
Good night, Miss Campbell.

85
00:06:12,305 --> 00:06:13,978
Good night, Jamie.

86
00:06:15,508 --> 00:06:18,587
That's the third time she's
been here this week.

87
00:06:18,845 --> 00:06:20,984
Yeah.

88
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:26,430
Look, maybe you
might want to think

89
00:06:26,652 --> 00:06:28,359
about starting to cool
things off with her.

90
00:06:28,621 --> 00:06:33,384
You guys fire her dad and now you
want me to brake it off with her?

91
00:06:33,559 --> 00:06:36,105
Your father had no choice.
We had to downsize.

92
00:06:36,329 --> 00:06:38,002
Danny, look at me.

93
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:42,702
You father and I have always expected
that you would go to Stanford.

94
00:06:42,969 --> 00:06:45,745
But you are not going
to get into any decent college

95
00:06:45,972 --> 00:06:50,016
if you spend all of your days playing
baseball or looking after Jamie hall.

96
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:52,382
You're not. You need
to get your grades up.

97
00:06:52,645 --> 00:06:55,956
And that needs to be
your only focus.

98
00:06:56,182 --> 00:06:57,627
Okay?

99
00:06:59,152 --> 00:07:00,631
Yeah.

100
00:07:16,502 --> 00:07:19,005
No wonder your real
momma didn't want you.

101
00:07:19,238 --> 00:07:21,047
That's a lie.

102
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:22,412
No, it's not.

103
00:07:22,675 --> 00:07:23,555
Don't say that, mommy.

104
00:07:23,776 --> 00:07:26,382
No, I am not your mommy.

105
00:07:26,612 --> 00:07:27,386
She's dead!

106
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:28,717
- No, be quiet!
- Dead!

107
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:31,428
Who'd want a sad
ugly freak like you?

108
00:07:31,684 --> 00:07:32,788
Shut up!

109
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:42,504
Hey, how's it going?

110
00:07:42,762 --> 00:07:43,866
Hello.

111
00:07:46,599 --> 00:07:48,943
Looks like I won't be
skipping class anymore.

112
00:07:49,202 --> 00:07:50,875
What?

113
00:07:51,103 --> 00:07:52,639
Just kidding.

114
00:07:55,708 --> 00:07:56,550
Hey.

115
00:07:56,776 --> 00:07:58,551
Whats up, brother?

116
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:03,423
Good morning, everyone.

117
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:04,627
My name is Miss Matson.

118
00:08:04,884 --> 00:08:08,831
I'm filling in for Mrs. Cohen
for the rest of the year.

119
00:08:09,055 --> 00:08:12,202
Now, it's not my intention to come
in here and undo her curriculum,

120
00:08:12,425 --> 00:08:13,927
but to pick up
where she left off.

121
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,697
So I had a chance to look
at some of your papers

122
00:08:16,963 --> 00:08:19,910
on the meaning and impact of
your favorite literary quotes.

123
00:08:20,132 --> 00:08:23,477
I have to say, I was
intrigued by a few of them.

124
00:08:23,736 --> 00:08:27,047
Um, one being Trent Davies.

125
00:08:27,273 --> 00:08:29,810
"Romeo, Romeo,
where for art thou, Romeo?"

126
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:33,179
- Hey, Romeo.
- Hey, babe.

127
00:08:33,446 --> 00:08:39,092
And Jamie hall's "love never
claims it ever gives."

128
00:08:39,318 --> 00:08:40,956
Jamie?
Who...?

129
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:45,863
Oh. Gandhi,
if I'm not mistaken?

130
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:51,067
Now, it's not a literary quote,
but it's lovely all the same.

131
00:08:51,297 --> 00:08:52,935
How about...

132
00:08:54,967 --> 00:08:59,205
"He who love touches not
walks in darkness."

133
00:09:02,608 --> 00:09:06,715
Plato's symposium, and one
of my personal favorites.

134
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:09,818
Now, before you all
start groaning

135
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:12,859
about how you ended up
with such a mean teacher,

136
00:09:13,119 --> 00:09:16,589
the following quiz is one
that Mrs. Cohen prepared...

137
00:09:16,822 --> 00:09:18,631
before she left.

138
00:09:18,858 --> 00:09:21,065
I'm just following
her curriculum.

139
00:09:21,327 --> 00:09:22,772
Besides, you guys
should know this.

140
00:09:22,995 --> 00:09:25,498
It's pretty easy, I think.

141
00:09:25,731 --> 00:09:28,541
Take one, pass it down, please.

142
00:09:33,973 --> 00:09:36,852
See you tomorrow.

143
00:09:38,844 --> 00:09:41,825
Thank you.

144
00:09:45,885 --> 00:09:47,193
Thank you.

145
00:09:55,895 --> 00:09:57,101
Uh...

146
00:09:57,363 --> 00:09:59,070
Uh, Danny...

147
00:10:00,733 --> 00:10:02,906
Can I see you for a moment?

148
00:10:04,937 --> 00:10:08,111
Uh... yeah.

149
00:10:08,374 --> 00:10:12,344
I was speaking with the principal and she
mentioned that if you're going to stay

150
00:10:12,545 --> 00:10:17,928
on the team, you need to maintain a 3.0.
How's that working out for you?

151
00:10:18,184 --> 00:10:19,857
Not great.

152
00:10:20,086 --> 00:10:21,622
Mm-hmm.

153
00:10:21,887 --> 00:10:24,697
Well, um, the team
needs their captain,

154
00:10:24,924 --> 00:10:27,803
and I'm here to get you out
of high school hell,

155
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:31,166
and to help you move on
to where you really wanna be.

156
00:10:31,397 --> 00:10:35,209
So, why don't you
see me after school.

157
00:10:35,434 --> 00:10:38,210
But I promise
I won't take long.

158
00:10:38,437 --> 00:10:41,418
Um, yeah, all right.

159
00:10:49,548 --> 00:10:53,189
That test was ridiculous.

160
00:10:56,589 --> 00:10:59,365
Okay, which is a form of conflict?

161
00:10:59,592 --> 00:11:01,731
A, man versus man?

162
00:11:01,961 --> 00:11:03,668
B, man versus himself?

163
00:11:03,929 --> 00:11:06,910
C, both of the above?

164
00:11:07,133 --> 00:11:08,737
A?

165
00:11:10,569 --> 00:11:13,049
All right, let me
ask you a question.

166
00:11:13,272 --> 00:11:16,116
Um, do you have a girlfriend?

167
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:17,685
Uh, yeah.

168
00:11:17,943 --> 00:11:21,322
All right, so let's say

169
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:25,992
you meet another girl and
she rocks your world...

170
00:11:26,252 --> 00:11:27,731
Hmm.

171
00:11:27,953 --> 00:11:29,762
But you love your girlfriend,

172
00:11:29,989 --> 00:11:34,995
so what's going on
inside with you?

173
00:11:36,462 --> 00:11:37,736
Conflict.

174
00:11:37,963 --> 00:11:39,237
Exactly.

175
00:11:39,465 --> 00:11:41,103
Man versus himself.

176
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:42,835
Ah.

177
00:11:52,311 --> 00:11:55,849
This, this paper really has
a lot more promise now.

178
00:11:56,115 --> 00:11:57,924
Yeah?

179
00:11:58,150 --> 00:12:00,790
Thanks. Honestly,
you're the first teacher

180
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:02,863
who's ever given me
a second chance.

181
00:12:03,122 --> 00:12:03,998
Aww.

182
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:05,429
You're pretty cool.

183
00:12:07,326 --> 00:12:09,806
Thank you, Danny.

184
00:12:10,029 --> 00:12:12,873
That really means a lot to me.

185
00:12:13,999 --> 00:12:14,875
Yeah.

186
00:12:15,134 --> 00:12:16,078
Thanks again.

187
00:12:16,302 --> 00:12:17,303
Well, sure.

188
00:12:17,536 --> 00:12:23,009
Hey, I'm free after
school on Thursday

189
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:26,018
if you need more help.

190
00:12:26,245 --> 00:12:28,122
Uh, midterms are coming up.

191
00:12:29,915 --> 00:12:34,224
Ah, actually, Jamie and I, our first
year anniversary is Thursday.

192
00:12:34,487 --> 00:12:36,933
Oh.

193
00:12:37,156 --> 00:12:39,136
Okay, so you already have plans.

194
00:12:39,358 --> 00:12:44,807
Um, how about this, why
don't you, um, give me

195
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:48,503
your cell number and then I
can help you with your paper.

196
00:12:48,734 --> 00:12:50,236
You know, find a topic.

197
00:12:50,503 --> 00:12:53,541
Um, yeah, okay, cool

198
00:12:57,243 --> 00:12:58,119
thanks again.

199
00:12:58,377 --> 00:12:59,856
Anytime.

200
00:13:12,057 --> 00:13:13,934
Here you go.

201
00:13:14,193 --> 00:13:16,195
And I'll be right back
with refills of your tea.

202
00:13:16,428 --> 00:13:18,374
Thanks.

203
00:13:21,934 --> 00:13:23,038
Hello?

204
00:13:23,269 --> 00:13:24,475
Lauren, it's me.

205
00:13:24,737 --> 00:13:26,842
Hey, Phil.
How bad is he?

206
00:13:27,072 --> 00:13:28,380
Really bad.

207
00:13:28,607 --> 00:13:30,109
All right, well, I can't
do anything about it now,

208
00:13:30,376 --> 00:13:31,753
but I'll take care
of it during my break.

209
00:13:31,977 --> 00:13:33,456
- All right.
- Thanks.

210
00:13:47,059 --> 00:13:48,265
Aww.

211
00:13:53,165 --> 00:13:54,109
Hello!

212
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:55,869
Jamie, is your father home?

213
00:13:56,135 --> 00:13:57,409
No. Why?

214
00:13:57,636 --> 00:14:01,478
Well, Phil called, and he was in the
bar going off about Mr. Campbell.

215
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:04,448
He tried to stop him, but
he left in pretty rough shape.

216
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:07,783
I'm just worried that he
might be headed over there.

217
00:14:08,013 --> 00:14:11,017
Okay, I'll go get him.

218
00:15:04,536 --> 00:15:06,345
Hey, you pig!

219
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:08,848
What in the world?

220
00:15:09,074 --> 00:15:12,055
It's the big bad wolf coming
to blow your house down.

221
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:22,321
What are you doing here?

222
00:15:22,554 --> 00:15:24,227
You're home.

223
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:25,935
Of course I'm home.

224
00:15:26,158 --> 00:15:27,637
I just want to talk.

225
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:29,567
What do you want to say?

226
00:15:29,828 --> 00:15:31,865
I was there with you on
the ground floor, Brad.

227
00:15:32,097 --> 00:15:33,974
18 years I gave you.

228
00:15:34,233 --> 00:15:35,507
18!

229
00:15:35,734 --> 00:15:38,271
And for what?

230
00:15:38,537 --> 00:15:39,641
For nothing.

231
00:15:39,872 --> 00:15:42,011
Do you even know
anything about loyalty?

232
00:15:42,241 --> 00:15:44,420
Dad, come on.
It's time you went home, Steven.

233
00:15:44,677 --> 00:15:48,449
To what?! To my house, the
house that gonna lose because

234
00:15:48,681 --> 00:15:50,991
my 18 years of service with
your company are not valuable?

235
00:15:51,216 --> 00:15:52,217
Gwen, go call the police.

236
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:55,698
No, please, I'll get him home right
now, okay? Dad, come on, please.

237
00:15:55,921 --> 00:15:57,366
Let's go.

238
00:15:57,589 --> 00:15:59,535
18 years, and look at you.

239
00:16:00,759 --> 00:16:02,033
Who'd hire you now?

240
00:16:03,362 --> 00:16:05,682
You don't need to beat him down
more than you already have.

241
00:16:05,731 --> 00:16:08,075
Come on.

242
00:16:40,466 --> 00:16:41,410
Ahh!

243
00:16:43,168 --> 00:16:44,511
What have you done?

244
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:47,275
What have you done?!

245
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:49,144
What have you done?!

246
00:16:49,408 --> 00:16:51,251
Who's ugly now?

247
00:17:02,788 --> 00:17:06,996
You're the first teacher who's
ever given me a second chance.

248
00:17:07,259 --> 00:17:09,466
You're pretty cool.

249
00:17:14,299 --> 00:17:15,744
Oh.

250
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:25,655
Very nice.

251
00:17:37,689 --> 00:17:39,726
Great job.

252
00:17:39,992 --> 00:17:41,471
Thank you.

253
00:17:43,295 --> 00:17:44,433
All right, great job, guys.

254
00:17:44,663 --> 00:17:46,165
Most of you did very well.

255
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:48,207
I was very impressed.

256
00:17:50,369 --> 00:17:52,508
Um, Miss Matson?

257
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:53,716
Yes?

258
00:17:53,972 --> 00:17:56,575
I was just wondering,
this is the first time

259
00:17:56,842 --> 00:17:59,049
I've gotten a "C" on anything,

260
00:17:59,311 --> 00:18:02,350
and I really need a good grade to
get a scholarship to Whittendale.

261
00:18:02,581 --> 00:18:05,425
Whittendale.
Well, that's impressive.

262
00:18:05,684 --> 00:18:08,324
My dad's been out of work
for over a year,

263
00:18:08,554 --> 00:18:11,501
and anyways, I don't want
any kind of special treatment.

264
00:18:11,723 --> 00:18:13,566
I just, I wanna know
what I can do.

265
00:18:13,826 --> 00:18:16,272
Can I make it up somehow?

266
00:18:16,495 --> 00:18:18,497
Was there something I didn't
understand about the assignment?

267
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:20,607
Not at all.
In fact,

268
00:18:20,866 --> 00:18:22,470
you nailed
the assignment right on.

269
00:18:22,701 --> 00:18:25,238
See, that was the problem.

270
00:18:25,504 --> 00:18:27,677
There was nothing
personal in the paper.

271
00:18:27,906 --> 00:18:30,409
Nothing showed me
that Jamie hall wrote it.

272
00:18:30,676 --> 00:18:33,657
Oh. Well, I didn't realize.

273
00:18:33,879 --> 00:18:35,085
My teachers always expect

274
00:18:35,347 --> 00:18:37,293
a lot of references
and footnotes.

275
00:18:37,516 --> 00:18:40,656
Well, I'm not
any of your other teachers.

276
00:18:42,421 --> 00:18:44,298
Listen, I'm also
not a mean teacher,

277
00:18:44,556 --> 00:18:46,331
so here's what we can do.

278
00:18:46,558 --> 00:18:49,539
How about you pull
together another paper

279
00:18:49,761 --> 00:18:53,470
by tomorrow, same topic, just
inject more Jamie into it,

280
00:18:53,732 --> 00:18:54,972
and I'll mark it as your first.

281
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:56,443
By tomorrow?

282
00:18:56,702 --> 00:18:57,578
Yes.

283
00:18:58,770 --> 00:18:59,714
Is that a problem?

284
00:18:59,938 --> 00:19:03,308
No, I just... I had
some important plans.

285
00:19:03,575 --> 00:19:06,579
More important than college?

286
00:19:10,249 --> 00:19:11,421
I'll cancel them.

287
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:13,254
That a girl.

288
00:19:15,721 --> 00:19:17,564
All right, see you tomorrow.

289
00:19:21,426 --> 00:19:23,872
You guys were so great
last weekend, honestly.

290
00:19:24,096 --> 00:19:26,406
Let's go out and
do it again, guys.

291
00:19:26,632 --> 00:19:28,134
- Hey.
- Hey.

292
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,242
Hi.

293
00:19:29,468 --> 00:19:30,845
You excited for tonight?

294
00:19:31,103 --> 00:19:36,482
Um, actually, I can't go out.

295
00:19:36,742 --> 00:19:38,449
What do you mean?
We've...

296
00:19:38,677 --> 00:19:39,621
We've been planning
this for weeks.

297
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:40,789
It's our anniversary.

298
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:42,287
I know.

299
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:44,619
I need to redo my paper.

300
00:19:46,118 --> 00:19:47,495
It's just one "C."

301
00:19:47,753 --> 00:19:49,460
But it counts for 10%
of my final grade.

302
00:19:50,923 --> 00:19:52,732
I'm not lucky like you are.

303
00:19:52,958 --> 00:19:55,078
My parents don't have the
money to send me to college.

304
00:19:55,093 --> 00:19:56,629
I need a scholarship.

305
00:19:56,862 --> 00:19:58,808
So this is my dad's fault again?

306
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:00,806
No, that's not what I said.

307
00:20:03,101 --> 00:20:04,603
I gotta go.

308
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:12,753
Here.

309
00:20:13,011 --> 00:20:14,615
Happy anniversary.

310
00:20:29,394 --> 00:20:31,203
Hey!

311
00:20:31,463 --> 00:20:32,601
Sorry you guys lost tonight.

312
00:20:32,831 --> 00:20:33,969
Are you okay?

313
00:20:34,199 --> 00:20:36,577
I heard that coach Braun

314
00:20:36,835 --> 00:20:38,644
can really dole out
quite an earful.

315
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:41,817
Yeah, yeah, especially
to the team captain.

316
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:43,519
Aww.

317
00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:45,449
Well, at least you have
your anniversary

318
00:20:45,711 --> 00:20:47,486
to look forward to.

319
00:20:47,713 --> 00:20:50,717
I would,
but Jamie bailed on me.

320
00:20:50,983 --> 00:20:53,964
Oh, that's right.

321
00:20:54,186 --> 00:20:56,826
Sorry, I just wanna give her
a chance to redo her paper.

322
00:20:57,055 --> 00:20:59,399
No, no, that's cool.

323
00:21:02,394 --> 00:21:04,533
Well,
do you have any other plans?

324
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:08,977
I was gonna go over to Trent's.

325
00:21:09,234 --> 00:21:14,843
Well, if you're interested, I've
got a sure way to cheer you up.

326
00:21:15,073 --> 00:21:16,950
Oh, yeah, what's that?

327
00:21:17,209 --> 00:21:20,588
Hop in, and I'll show you.

328
00:21:38,196 --> 00:21:38,729
I can't do this anymore.

329
00:21:38,730 --> 00:21:39,800
I can't do this anymore.

330
00:21:40,032 --> 00:21:41,636
I cannot keep holding
down the fort

331
00:21:41,867 --> 00:21:43,710
while you go around
feeling sorry for yourself,

332
00:21:43,935 --> 00:21:46,381
and drinking, and racking up
the credit card debt.

333
00:21:46,605 --> 00:21:47,777
What do you want me to do?

334
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:50,748
I have over 18 years
of engineering experience

335
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:52,496
and I'm not just
gonna throw that away.

336
00:21:52,644 --> 00:21:54,044
You know what,
maybe your problem is

337
00:21:54,279 --> 00:21:56,816
you go down there and put
your confidence to your ego.

338
00:21:57,082 --> 00:21:59,028
I have confidence.
Then go paint a house.

339
00:21:59,251 --> 00:22:01,131
I have confidence.
I've been out there every day

340
00:22:01,253 --> 00:22:02,732
looking for a job.

341
00:22:02,954 --> 00:22:04,558
I'm sick and tired
of hearing "you're too old."

342
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:06,497
You're on that
computer every day.

343
00:22:06,758 --> 00:22:07,930
"You're too qualified,"
I'm sick of hearing it.

344
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,503
I understand your...

345
00:22:09,761 --> 00:22:11,399
So what is this place?

346
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:13,007
It's exactly what you think it is,

347
00:22:13,265 --> 00:22:15,541
a hole in the wall
in Chinatown.

348
00:22:17,569 --> 00:22:19,571
Ooh, is it important?

349
00:22:19,805 --> 00:22:22,684
No, it's nothing.

350
00:22:22,941 --> 00:22:23,919
Okay.

351
00:22:24,142 --> 00:22:26,520
So...

352
00:22:26,778 --> 00:22:32,394
I found that the best cure
for anything is beer.

353
00:22:32,617 --> 00:22:34,619
And a little MSG.

354
00:22:36,655 --> 00:22:37,599
You sure that's okay?

355
00:22:37,823 --> 00:22:39,325
It's just one beer.

356
00:22:39,591 --> 00:22:40,912
I won't tell anybody
if you won't.

357
00:22:43,128 --> 00:22:48,467
So, um... What were your
plans tonight with Jamie?

358
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:50,873
Were you guys gonna have dinner

359
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:53,946
and then a little
sex in the back seat?

360
00:22:57,309 --> 00:23:00,017
What? I know what
it's like to be a teenager.

361
00:23:01,613 --> 00:23:04,691
You can't exactly do it when
you're still living at home.

362
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:06,429
Yeah, right.

363
00:23:06,651 --> 00:23:09,757
Maybe for those
that are actually doing it.

364
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:13,760
Aww.

365
00:23:20,298 --> 00:23:21,641
Hello?

366
00:23:21,867 --> 00:23:23,505
Hey, Heather, it's Jamie.

367
00:23:23,735 --> 00:23:25,681
Do you know where Danny is?

368
00:23:25,904 --> 00:23:26,780
Ah, yeah, he was
supposed to come over

369
00:23:27,038 --> 00:23:28,346
to Trent's after the game.

370
00:23:28,573 --> 00:23:29,779
Hey, did Danny ever show up?

371
00:23:30,041 --> 00:23:31,384
No, I haven't seen him.

372
00:23:31,643 --> 00:23:32,747
I guess he didn't show up.

373
00:23:33,845 --> 00:23:34,880
That's weird.

374
00:23:35,147 --> 00:23:38,921
Look, well, uh, if he shows up,
can you tell him to call me?

375
00:23:39,184 --> 00:23:40,822
Yeah. Sure, I'll tell him.

376
00:23:41,052 --> 00:23:43,396
Okay, thanks.

377
00:23:46,558 --> 00:23:48,060
Okay, Danny,

378
00:23:48,326 --> 00:23:55,041
here, if you ever need any extra
tutoring, here's my address.

379
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:56,610
Whoa.

380
00:23:56,868 --> 00:23:59,712
My door is always open.

381
00:23:59,938 --> 00:24:00,814
Thanks.

382
00:24:01,072 --> 00:24:02,449
Mm-hmm.

383
00:24:02,707 --> 00:24:04,653
Oh. You know, ah,

384
00:24:04,876 --> 00:24:06,916
I must've forgot my phone.
I'll be right back, okay?

385
00:24:07,112 --> 00:24:08,420
Okay.

386
00:24:19,090 --> 00:24:20,626
Ugly little girl.

387
00:24:26,231 --> 00:24:27,107
You okay?

388
00:24:30,368 --> 00:24:32,644
I just need
to get something, sorry.

389
00:24:37,909 --> 00:24:39,217
Here it is.

390
00:24:47,118 --> 00:24:49,621
I should probably
get back to my car.

391
00:24:51,756 --> 00:24:53,258
Mm-hmm.

392
00:25:09,174 --> 00:25:11,620
Hey. Hey.

393
00:25:11,843 --> 00:25:12,685
Hi.

394
00:25:14,246 --> 00:25:17,022
So, I called you last night.
Where were you?

395
00:25:18,316 --> 00:25:22,491
I just went over to
Trent's after the game.

396
00:25:22,754 --> 00:25:23,858
Hey, Danny!

397
00:25:24,089 --> 00:25:25,534
- Whats up, man?
- Hey.

398
00:25:25,757 --> 00:25:27,202
Hey, you guys going
to the big bash tonight?

399
00:25:27,425 --> 00:25:29,226
- I don't know. Where is it?
- It's at Gil's.

400
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:30,897
His parents are going
to Tahoe for the weekend.

401
00:25:31,162 --> 00:25:32,106
Nice. Yeah, I'm in.

402
00:25:32,330 --> 00:25:33,934
What about you, Jamie?

403
00:25:34,165 --> 00:25:36,475
She's probably got
to study or something, right?

404
00:25:36,701 --> 00:25:38,078
No, I'll go.

405
00:25:38,336 --> 00:25:40,714
Sounds like a party.

406
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:43,785
All right, babe, I'll see you.

407
00:26:01,126 --> 00:26:02,799
- Danny.
- Hey.

408
00:26:03,028 --> 00:26:04,530
Hey, guys.

409
00:26:26,718 --> 00:26:28,197
Hey.

410
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:31,026
Hey. You made it.

411
00:26:31,256 --> 00:26:33,065
Yeah, I said I was coming.

412
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:38,537
Look, I'm sorry
about cur anniversary,

413
00:26:38,763 --> 00:26:41,937
and I want to make it up to you.

414
00:26:46,838 --> 00:26:48,613
Come here.

415
00:27:14,265 --> 00:27:15,300
Danny, stop.

416
00:27:27,445 --> 00:27:29,049
I said stop!

417
00:27:35,253 --> 00:27:36,857
Screw it.

418
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:40,689
Hey.

419
00:28:40,952 --> 00:28:41,760
Hey.

420
00:28:41,986 --> 00:28:43,067
Do you know where Danny is?

421
00:28:43,121 --> 00:28:44,395
No, why?

422
00:28:44,622 --> 00:28:46,295
You guys doing okay?

423
00:28:46,524 --> 00:28:48,800
I don't know.

424
00:28:49,027 --> 00:28:52,906
Well, look, I've come to find that
when you're having boy troubles,

425
00:28:53,164 --> 00:28:56,202
the best way to get over them
is by having a little fun.

426
00:28:56,468 --> 00:28:58,345
Bottoms up, babe.

427
00:29:02,841 --> 00:29:05,321
All right, let's see here.

428
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:11,185
Let's see here.

429
00:29:11,416 --> 00:29:13,362
Oh. You know, it's
your battery terminal.

430
00:29:13,585 --> 00:29:15,121
My what?

431
00:29:15,386 --> 00:29:17,386
- This is your negative battery terminal.
- Uh-huh.

432
00:29:17,555 --> 00:29:20,365
It's usually connected here.

433
00:29:20,592 --> 00:29:21,935
Ohh.

434
00:29:22,193 --> 00:29:24,901
Oh, no,
look how dirty your hands are.

435
00:29:25,163 --> 00:29:26,198
Oh.

436
00:29:26,431 --> 00:29:27,273
Oh.

437
00:29:27,532 --> 00:29:28,840
It's no big deal.

438
00:29:29,067 --> 00:29:31,744
Oh, come inside and I'll
clean 'em off for you.

439
00:29:32,003 --> 00:29:34,381
The movie I was gonna see
already started anyway,

440
00:29:34,606 --> 00:29:36,085
so it's the least I could do.

441
00:29:36,341 --> 00:29:37,877
Come on.

442
00:29:38,109 --> 00:29:39,782
Okay.

443
00:29:44,048 --> 00:29:46,426
Do you have a lot of car problems?

444
00:29:46,684 --> 00:29:51,763
Well, my car's what do you think?

445
00:29:52,023 --> 00:29:53,525
Give me your hand.

446
00:29:55,894 --> 00:29:58,204
If you need a good mechanic,
I know one.

447
00:29:58,429 --> 00:30:00,466
Do you know Tony's auto body?

448
00:30:00,732 --> 00:30:03,076
They only take cash,
but they do a good job.

449
00:30:04,602 --> 00:30:08,311
Are they, are they
like a chop shop?

450
00:30:08,573 --> 00:30:11,952
- Something like that.
- Mm-hmm.

451
00:30:12,210 --> 00:30:18,858
Um, I don't know if this is
doing that great of a job.

452
00:30:20,084 --> 00:30:22,030
I don't know,
what do you think?

453
00:30:36,601 --> 00:30:38,444
Sorry, I don't know
what I was thinking.

454
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:41,446
No, no, it's okay.

455
00:30:41,673 --> 00:30:45,143
You're 18.
You can do whatever you want

456
00:30:45,410 --> 00:30:48,220
with whomever you want.

457
00:31:25,516 --> 00:31:26,893
Hey, it's okay.

458
00:31:27,151 --> 00:31:28,528
I'm not gonna tell anybody.

459
00:31:30,054 --> 00:31:32,534
It'll be our little secret, okay?

460
00:31:55,179 --> 00:31:56,522
Where have you been?

461
00:31:56,748 --> 00:31:58,468
God, Jamie, what...
What are you doing here?

462
00:31:58,483 --> 00:31:59,427
It's one o'clock in the morning.

463
00:31:59,651 --> 00:32:01,756
And what are you
just doing getting home?

464
00:32:03,154 --> 00:32:04,929
Have you been drinking?

465
00:32:05,156 --> 00:32:06,965
Don't turn this around on me.

466
00:32:07,191 --> 00:32:10,502
I know you were
with someone tonight.

467
00:32:10,728 --> 00:32:12,036
- I wasn't-
- Who is she?

468
00:32:12,263 --> 00:32:13,463
- I wasn't with anyone.
- Liar!

469
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:18,945
Were you with her the night you
were supposed to be at Trent's?

470
00:32:19,203 --> 00:32:20,978
Tell me, Danny.

471
00:32:21,205 --> 00:32:22,240
Tell me who she is!

472
00:32:22,507 --> 00:32:24,214
Hey, hey, what is going on here?

473
00:32:24,442 --> 00:32:25,580
Are you drunk?

474
00:32:25,843 --> 00:32:27,880
Why won't you talk to me?

475
00:32:28,112 --> 00:32:30,313
Okay, Danny, go in the house
and call her a cab, please.

476
00:32:30,515 --> 00:32:31,994
Go.

477
00:32:32,216 --> 00:32:34,656
Do you have any idea how irresp...
Jamie, where are you going?

478
00:32:34,786 --> 00:32:36,322
Jamie hall, do not
get into your car.

479
00:32:36,587 --> 00:32:38,089
Jamie!

480
00:32:38,356 --> 00:32:39,528
You're not going with her.
You're not going with her.

481
00:32:39,757 --> 00:32:41,361
Hey, Jamie, come on.

482
00:32:41,592 --> 00:32:43,970
Don't... don't-
what are you doing?

483
00:32:44,228 --> 00:32:46,708
Jamie, don't drive off.
Pl...

484
00:32:49,867 --> 00:32:52,677
Okay, all right, great.
Thanks, Gwen.

485
00:32:58,409 --> 00:32:59,444
Jamie?

486
00:33:01,779 --> 00:33:03,588
Where have you been?

487
00:33:03,815 --> 00:33:05,590
I've been worried sick.

488
00:33:05,817 --> 00:33:07,262
I was at a party.

489
00:33:07,485 --> 00:33:09,123
Well, I just got off the phone
with Danny's mother.

490
00:33:09,387 --> 00:33:10,587
She said you've been drinking?

491
00:33:10,788 --> 00:33:11,960
I had like one drink.

492
00:33:12,223 --> 00:33:13,702
One?
Jamie, you're 18.

493
00:33:13,925 --> 00:33:15,565
You're not supposed
to be drinking at all.

494
00:33:15,626 --> 00:33:17,606
And you're driving?
Whats wrong with you?

495
00:33:17,829 --> 00:33:20,002
God, mom, can't you just
leave me alone

496
00:33:20,264 --> 00:33:22,039
like you normally do?

497
00:33:27,638 --> 00:33:29,481
Today, we're gonna
start reviewing

498
00:33:29,741 --> 00:33:32,119
in preparation
for your midterm exam.

499
00:33:32,343 --> 00:33:35,381
Mike, stop talking.

500
00:33:35,646 --> 00:33:37,284
Today we've got a lot
to cover, guys.

501
00:33:37,515 --> 00:33:39,051
Let's get started.

502
00:33:39,317 --> 00:33:41,422
I can't believe she gave me a "c."

503
00:33:41,652 --> 00:33:43,154
I did exactly what she wanted.

504
00:33:43,421 --> 00:33:45,765
I rewrote the entire paper.

505
00:33:45,990 --> 00:33:48,197
It's like she has
something against me.

506
00:33:48,459 --> 00:33:50,166
Maybe you should try
talking to her again.

507
00:33:50,428 --> 00:33:51,236
Look, there he is.

508
00:33:51,462 --> 00:33:52,600
Are you gonna talk to him?

509
00:33:52,830 --> 00:33:55,106
No.

510
00:33:55,333 --> 00:33:57,711
Have you even seen him
since the party?

511
00:33:57,969 --> 00:34:01,439
I tried calling him all weekend,
but he wouldn't answer.

512
00:34:01,672 --> 00:34:05,350
Are you sure he's fooling around,
and he's not just brushing you off?

513
00:34:05,610 --> 00:34:07,283
Heather, he's been lying to me.

514
00:34:07,512 --> 00:34:10,652
Why else would he unless
he has something to hide?

515
00:34:10,882 --> 00:34:12,723
I'm gonna go get
a frappuccino on the way home.

516
00:34:12,784 --> 00:34:13,762
Are you coming?

517
00:34:16,287 --> 00:34:17,561
Maybe later.

518
00:34:17,789 --> 00:34:19,063
All right.

519
00:34:19,290 --> 00:34:20,633
What?
There's nothing to say.

520
00:34:26,731 --> 00:34:28,608
I don't believe it.

521
00:34:28,866 --> 00:34:29,742
Coach Braun has
actually threatened

522
00:34:30,001 --> 00:34:31,309
to kick me off the team.

523
00:34:31,536 --> 00:34:33,641
Oh, don't worry.

524
00:34:33,871 --> 00:34:35,748
I'm sure he's just
blowing off steam

525
00:34:36,007 --> 00:34:39,045
so you'll do what you have to
to get your grades up.

526
00:34:39,310 --> 00:34:42,484
With my help,
it's already happening.

527
00:34:46,350 --> 00:34:47,795
Do you think it's enough?

528
00:34:48,019 --> 00:34:51,223
Straight A's is
definitely enough.

529
00:34:51,489 --> 00:34:55,804
Add your midterm grade to that, which I'm
sure you'll pass with flying colors,

530
00:34:56,027 --> 00:34:58,337
and you're golden.

531
00:35:15,847 --> 00:35:20,091
If you're going to stay on the
team, you have to maintain a 3.0.

532
00:35:20,351 --> 00:35:21,830
Why don't you see me
after school?

533
00:35:24,689 --> 00:35:26,794
Great job.

534
00:35:33,865 --> 00:35:38,542
If I don't get into Stanford, my parents
are going to be so disappointed.

535
00:35:38,769 --> 00:35:40,646
Do you want to go?

536
00:35:40,905 --> 00:35:42,612
Of course, yeah.

537
00:35:42,874 --> 00:35:45,411
I mean, it's a great school.

538
00:35:45,643 --> 00:35:47,748
I just don't know
if I can hack it.

539
00:35:47,979 --> 00:35:50,516
My-my dad's always been

540
00:35:50,781 --> 00:35:53,660
so successful
at whatever he does.

541
00:35:55,953 --> 00:35:59,162
I guess he just assumes
I'll be the same.

542
00:36:00,825 --> 00:36:05,103
Sometimes mothers and fathers can

543
00:36:05,329 --> 00:36:08,708
drive us to do things
we feel we have to do.

544
00:36:08,966 --> 00:36:13,312
Are your parents like that?

545
00:36:13,571 --> 00:36:15,278
I never knew my parents.

546
00:36:15,506 --> 00:36:19,784
I... I had a foster mother.

547
00:36:22,647 --> 00:36:24,627
She was something.

548
00:36:27,785 --> 00:36:31,631
She was the only
mother I ever knew.

549
00:36:31,856 --> 00:36:33,665
It's too bad she...

550
00:36:36,627 --> 00:36:39,403
It's too bad she died
when she did.

551
00:36:40,932 --> 00:36:45,807
It's such a horrible way...
To die by your own hand.

552
00:36:46,037 --> 00:36:46,845
What have you done?!

553
00:36:50,374 --> 00:36:53,253
Is she...
She killed herself?

554
00:36:55,046 --> 00:36:57,890
Insulin overdose.

555
00:37:00,384 --> 00:37:04,264
She was diabetic,
and they concluded that

556
00:37:04,522 --> 00:37:06,365
she made a mistake...

557
00:37:08,626 --> 00:37:10,799
A terrible, terrible mistake.

558
00:37:50,534 --> 00:37:52,013
Who are you texting with?

559
00:37:52,236 --> 00:37:54,238
Oh, just Trent.

560
00:37:55,673 --> 00:37:57,482
What?

561
00:37:57,708 --> 00:37:59,551
Nothing.

562
00:37:59,777 --> 00:38:00,881
I guess I'm just...

563
00:38:01,112 --> 00:38:03,251
I'm just stressed
with school and everything.

564
00:38:03,514 --> 00:38:05,619
Miss Matson.

565
00:38:05,850 --> 00:38:09,320
For some reason, she keeps
being extra hard on me.

566
00:38:10,921 --> 00:38:12,400
What do you mean?

567
00:38:12,623 --> 00:38:15,630
She keeps giving me lousy grades
when I know the work is good.

568
00:38:15,893 --> 00:38:19,363
I mean, why would she do that?

569
00:38:20,965 --> 00:38:22,672
How should I know?

570
00:38:24,535 --> 00:38:26,708
- Look, I gotta go.
- Wait, Danny.

571
00:38:26,937 --> 00:38:28,473
Can we talk?

572
00:38:28,739 --> 00:38:31,583
Ah. Sorry, I've got
some stuff I got to do.

573
00:38:31,809 --> 00:38:32,787
Like what?

574
00:38:33,044 --> 00:38:35,923
Just running
some errands for my mom.

575
00:38:37,882 --> 00:38:38,986
Can I talk to you later?

576
00:40:13,677 --> 00:40:15,486
Did you miss me?

577
00:40:15,713 --> 00:40:17,886
I just saw you in class.

578
00:40:25,990 --> 00:40:30,501
Are you... are you failing
Jamie on purpose?

579
00:40:31,862 --> 00:40:33,170
What is she telling you?

580
00:40:33,397 --> 00:40:35,741
Nothing.
Really, I was just asking.

581
00:40:38,903 --> 00:40:40,541
No, silly.

582
00:40:43,607 --> 00:40:45,211
She's just being paranoid.

583
00:40:53,851 --> 00:40:54,886
What the hell?

584
00:40:56,887 --> 00:40:58,423
Oh. Oh, wait,
wait, wait!

585
00:40:58,689 --> 00:41:00,726
I'll make sure that
she doesn't tell anyone.

586
00:41:00,958 --> 00:41:02,164
No, I gotta go.

587
00:41:14,071 --> 00:41:15,778
Jamie!

588
00:41:38,262 --> 00:41:39,605
Jamie.

589
00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:42,538
Jamie, please, wait.

590
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:44,006
Hey, Jamie.
Jamie, please-

591
00:41:44,268 --> 00:41:45,110
how could you?

592
00:41:45,336 --> 00:41:46,679
It's not what you think.

593
00:41:46,937 --> 00:41:48,814
Are you serious?

594
00:41:49,073 --> 00:41:50,609
I know what I saw, Danny!

595
00:41:50,841 --> 00:41:51,842
You're making too big
a deal out of it.

596
00:41:52,109 --> 00:41:54,316
You're having sex
with our teacher.

597
00:41:55,779 --> 00:42:00,624
Jamie, listen, you know how
much of a hard ass my dad is.

598
00:42:02,286 --> 00:42:05,165
If he found out about this,
he'd kill me.

599
00:42:05,422 --> 00:42:08,266
He'd just--
He'd cut me off.

600
00:42:10,094 --> 00:42:14,465
Miss Matson's flunking me out of senior
lit while you two are messing around,

601
00:42:14,698 --> 00:42:16,974
and I'm supposed to protect you?

602
00:42:18,936 --> 00:42:19,914
I didn't mean for this to happen.

603
00:42:20,137 --> 00:42:22,515
Well, it did.

604
00:42:22,773 --> 00:42:27,253
No, ple-- I will take care of this.
I promise.

605
00:42:28,879 --> 00:42:30,859
Just... just please
don't say anything.

606
00:42:32,783 --> 00:42:36,060
Jamie, is everything okay?

607
00:42:43,727 --> 00:42:45,900
Danny?

608
00:42:46,163 --> 00:42:47,699
Yeah.

609
00:42:47,965 --> 00:42:50,138
Yeah, Mrs. hall,
everything's fine.

610
00:42:58,175 --> 00:43:01,816
Jamie, whats going on
with you and Danny?

611
00:43:04,148 --> 00:43:07,856
Didn't you hear him,
everything's fine.

612
00:43:08,085 --> 00:43:11,032
It didn't seem that way to me.

613
00:43:11,255 --> 00:43:14,259
Look, I'm sorry I got caught up
with everything going on,

614
00:43:14,525 --> 00:43:16,232
but I am here.

615
00:43:19,263 --> 00:43:21,641
Everything's fine, mom.

616
00:44:21,492 --> 00:44:22,766
Answer!

617
00:44:22,993 --> 00:44:25,303
Who'd want a sad
ugly freak like you?

618
00:44:25,562 --> 00:44:27,200
Shut up!

619
00:44:27,431 --> 00:44:28,774
He's mine!

620
00:44:31,502 --> 00:44:35,143
Jamie? Jamie,
can I have a minute?

621
00:44:35,406 --> 00:44:39,115
I had another look at the
paper you re-did for me,

622
00:44:39,343 --> 00:44:42,324
and although I don't
do this very often,

623
00:44:42,579 --> 00:44:46,186
I have to admit,
I believe I made a mistake.

624
00:44:49,953 --> 00:44:51,330
If you think this is
how you're going to get away

625
00:44:51,588 --> 00:44:55,069
with what you're doing,
you're wrong.

626
00:44:55,292 --> 00:44:56,930
What?

627
00:45:08,839 --> 00:45:10,341
Hey.

628
00:45:12,176 --> 00:45:14,281
So, how'd the stake out go?

629
00:45:14,511 --> 00:45:16,957
Did you catch him
doing anything or what?

630
00:45:17,181 --> 00:45:20,128
No. No, I didn't.

631
00:45:20,350 --> 00:45:22,193
See, I told you,

632
00:45:22,453 --> 00:45:24,057
Danny's not the type of guy
that would fool around.

633
00:45:24,288 --> 00:45:25,767
I gotta go.

634
00:45:32,029 --> 00:45:36,343
I didn't want to say anything,
but Jamie's behavior has been

635
00:45:36,567 --> 00:45:38,410
a little disrespectful lately.

636
00:45:38,669 --> 00:45:39,977
How so?

637
00:45:40,204 --> 00:45:42,912
Well, she became
very belligerent

638
00:45:43,173 --> 00:45:46,153
the other day when I gave her a
poor grade on one of her papers.

639
00:45:46,376 --> 00:45:48,185
She stormed off in a huff.

640
00:45:48,412 --> 00:45:50,050
Do you want me to talk to her?

641
00:45:50,314 --> 00:45:52,260
No, no, no,
I've got it under control.

642
00:45:52,483 --> 00:45:55,089
I just thought
I'd share that with you.

643
00:45:55,319 --> 00:45:58,994
She's going through a lot
of family problems at home,

644
00:45:59,223 --> 00:46:01,260
and I just want to be
really supportive

645
00:46:01,525 --> 00:46:02,731
and encouraging, you know.

646
00:46:02,993 --> 00:46:03,971
She's one of our best students.

647
00:46:04,194 --> 00:46:05,366
She certainly is.

648
00:46:05,596 --> 00:46:07,769
Well, you let me know
if you need anything.

649
00:46:08,031 --> 00:46:09,032
I will.

650
00:46:09,266 --> 00:46:10,973
You're doing
a wonderful job, Molly.

651
00:46:11,235 --> 00:46:12,339
Keep it up.

652
00:46:12,569 --> 00:46:14,879
Thank you, Mrs. Jenkins.

653
00:46:17,341 --> 00:46:18,945
Jamie.

654
00:46:21,512 --> 00:46:23,458
How's it going?

655
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:25,455
Miss Matson gave me an "A."

656
00:46:25,682 --> 00:46:27,821
Obviously, she was
failing me on purpose.

657
00:46:29,353 --> 00:46:32,857
I'm sorry, I really am.

658
00:46:33,090 --> 00:46:35,036
Thank you for not saying anything.

659
00:46:35,259 --> 00:46:38,433
And I'm gonna end it tonight.

660
00:46:40,397 --> 00:46:42,035
Do you mean it?

661
00:46:43,267 --> 00:46:44,405
I swear.

662
00:46:50,307 --> 00:46:52,253
My parents will be out later.

663
00:46:54,077 --> 00:46:57,581
You can come over to the
house and we'll talk.

664
00:46:59,483 --> 00:47:01,326
Okay. Later.

665
00:47:34,418 --> 00:47:37,262
Of course he still wants me.

666
00:47:37,487 --> 00:47:40,491
Oh, just look at ya.

667
00:47:40,757 --> 00:47:44,295
Who'd want a sad
ugly freak like you?

668
00:47:44,528 --> 00:47:47,509
Huh? Ugly...

669
00:47:47,764 --> 00:47:51,576
Ugly... freak!

670
00:47:51,802 --> 00:47:52,906
Freak!

671
00:47:54,438 --> 00:47:55,940
All right, I'll be home later.

672
00:47:56,173 --> 00:47:58,153
Wait just a second.

673
00:47:58,375 --> 00:48:00,412
- Where are you going?
- To meet Jamie.

674
00:48:00,677 --> 00:48:03,055
You have midterms in a few weeks.
You need to be studying.

675
00:48:03,313 --> 00:48:04,815
I just have something I gotta
take care of, all right?

676
00:48:05,048 --> 00:48:06,026
I'll be home soon.

677
00:48:06,283 --> 00:48:07,563
What do you need
to take care of?

678
00:48:07,651 --> 00:48:10,928
- Nothing.
- Danny, are you and Jamie breaking up?

679
00:48:41,051 --> 00:48:43,053
Hi.

680
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:45,960
Nice spot.

681
00:48:46,189 --> 00:48:48,191
Dark, secluded.

682
00:48:48,425 --> 00:48:50,098
What do you have in mind?

683
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:52,533
Back seat?

684
00:48:52,763 --> 00:48:55,039
Okay.

685
00:48:55,265 --> 00:48:56,073
Whats wrong?

686
00:48:56,333 --> 00:49:01,409
I... I just don't like the way
that you've been treating Jamie.

687
00:49:01,672 --> 00:49:04,016
I gave her an "A."

688
00:49:04,241 --> 00:49:05,879
What, is she still
bitching about it?

689
00:49:06,109 --> 00:49:08,585
No, she's not bi...
It's not about that, Molly.

690
00:49:08,845 --> 00:49:10,188
It's about this.

691
00:49:10,414 --> 00:49:12,917
I can't...
I can't do this anymore.

692
00:49:13,183 --> 00:49:15,344
Wait, wait, wait, she' been
talking to you, hasn't she?

693
00:49:15,452 --> 00:49:17,159
She's trying to scare you.

694
00:49:17,421 --> 00:49:20,459
There's nothing to worry about.

695
00:49:20,724 --> 00:49:24,934
She's not gonna tell anybody.

696
00:49:25,195 --> 00:49:28,540
She doesn't have any proof,
and besides,

697
00:49:28,765 --> 00:49:31,268
we'll just deny it.

698
00:49:31,535 --> 00:49:32,411
That's enough.

699
00:49:34,204 --> 00:49:36,047
I gotta go.

700
00:49:36,273 --> 00:49:37,581
Where are you going?

701
00:49:37,808 --> 00:49:39,913
To see Jamie.

702
00:49:40,143 --> 00:49:42,089
Why?

703
00:49:42,312 --> 00:49:44,258
Because she's alone, Molly.

704
00:49:44,481 --> 00:49:47,325
What... what's she
gonna do for you?

705
00:49:49,286 --> 00:49:52,927
We both know she's not
gonna give herself to you.

706
00:49:53,156 --> 00:49:53,998
That's enough.

707
00:49:54,257 --> 00:49:55,531
I know that you want me.

708
00:49:55,759 --> 00:49:57,397
No, I don't!
Stop, stop it!

709
00:49:57,627 --> 00:49:59,971
I don't want you anymore.

710
00:50:00,230 --> 00:50:01,174
Yes, you do.

711
00:50:01,398 --> 00:50:02,399
Stop... God!

712
00:50:04,101 --> 00:50:06,274
You're such a freak.

713
00:50:27,157 --> 00:50:29,262
No...

714
00:50:41,605 --> 00:50:43,414
Oh, no!

715
00:53:37,447 --> 00:53:38,551
Danny?

716
00:53:50,961 --> 00:53:52,599
Danny?

717
00:53:59,069 --> 00:54:00,207
Dad.

718
00:54:00,470 --> 00:54:01,346
Hey, sunshine.

719
00:54:01,571 --> 00:54:03,278
What are you doing out here?

720
00:54:03,540 --> 00:54:06,544
Nothing, I... I just...
I thought I heard something.

721
00:54:06,810 --> 00:54:09,654
No, it's just me.

722
00:54:09,879 --> 00:54:10,823
You okay?

723
00:54:11,047 --> 00:54:12,185
Yeah.

724
00:54:12,415 --> 00:54:13,257
Did I scare you?

725
00:54:13,516 --> 00:54:14,961
- You did scare me.
- Sorry.

726
00:55:02,799 --> 00:55:04,676
Hi, I know it's almost over,

727
00:55:04,934 --> 00:55:06,709
but can I get a ticket
to the 8:00 show?

728
00:55:06,936 --> 00:55:08,279
Sure.

729
00:55:08,538 --> 00:55:09,710
Thanks.

730
00:55:12,409 --> 00:55:16,585
Danny, what do you want
for breakfast?

731
00:55:19,749 --> 00:55:21,456
Danny.

732
00:55:24,487 --> 00:55:26,990
Sweetie, I'm opening...

733
00:56:09,432 --> 00:56:12,436
You have reached your destination.

734
00:56:17,173 --> 00:56:18,311
Hi.

735
00:56:18,541 --> 00:56:19,713
Hi. Can I help you?

736
00:56:19,976 --> 00:56:23,751
Uh, yeah, can you-
can you fix this?

737
00:56:25,815 --> 00:56:27,522
How'd that happen,
you ding it on the way

738
00:56:27,784 --> 00:56:29,593
to the mall buying some new shoes?

739
00:56:29,819 --> 00:56:32,322
Does it matter how it happened?

740
00:56:32,555 --> 00:56:34,933
Easy.
I'm not your husband, lady.

741
00:56:35,191 --> 00:56:40,697
Okay, uhh, is there somebody else I
can talk to, somebody more qualified?

742
00:56:40,964 --> 00:56:43,570
Hey, I'm as qualified
as they get.

743
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:46,974
Carla, go pump some air
in some tires or something.

744
00:56:47,203 --> 00:56:48,739
What can I do you for?

745
00:56:49,005 --> 00:56:51,144
How fast can you fix this?

746
00:56:53,843 --> 00:56:55,789
There's blood here.

747
00:56:56,012 --> 00:56:57,514
- What?
- What happened?

748
00:56:57,747 --> 00:56:58,851
No, no, no, no, no.

749
00:57:00,984 --> 00:57:02,964
No, I hit a deer.

750
00:57:03,186 --> 00:57:04,529
How fast can you fix it?

751
00:57:04,754 --> 00:57:07,394
Express service'll cost you extra.

752
00:57:09,759 --> 00:57:11,295
I'll give you what you want

753
00:57:11,561 --> 00:57:13,122
as long as you can
guarantee discretion.

754
00:57:13,229 --> 00:57:14,765
I don't need a receipt.

755
00:57:15,031 --> 00:57:17,705
Discretion'll cost you
a little extra, too.

756
00:57:17,934 --> 00:57:19,743
How much?

757
00:57:20,003 --> 00:57:22,984
Teenager, 18 years old,
and didn't come home last night.

758
00:57:23,206 --> 00:57:24,549
Wow, that's a new one.

759
00:57:24,774 --> 00:57:26,054
Yeah, his name is Danny Campbell.

760
00:57:26,276 --> 00:57:27,721
Father's name is Brad Campbell.

761
00:57:27,944 --> 00:57:30,647
Now, apparently, he's a big
mucky-muck friend of the mayor's.

762
00:57:30,914 --> 00:57:31,915
They have just called,
and they want us

763
00:57:32,182 --> 00:57:33,456
to move on this right away.

764
00:57:33,683 --> 00:57:35,163
Right, because boy
with a silver spoon

765
00:57:35,251 --> 00:57:36,731
- has got to get back by dinner.
- Yeah.

766
00:57:36,786 --> 00:57:37,764
So did they order
a trace on the cell!

767
00:57:38,021 --> 00:57:39,582
- 20 minutes ago.
- All right, let's go.

768
00:57:39,756 --> 00:57:40,734
All right, I'll drive.

769
00:57:45,295 --> 00:57:46,933
Hey, it's Danny.

770
00:57:47,197 --> 00:57:48,870
Leave me a message
and I'll hit you back.

771
00:58:00,276 --> 00:58:03,553
How long before you
get rid of the old one?

772
00:58:03,780 --> 00:58:05,623
Salvage truck comes by on Monday.

773
00:58:05,882 --> 00:58:07,657
And then what?

774
00:58:07,884 --> 00:58:10,160
Then it gets shipped off
to a yard in Fontana.

775
00:58:10,386 --> 00:58:11,888
Then it disappears forever.

776
00:58:13,156 --> 00:58:15,932
Well, it should

777
00:58:16,159 --> 00:58:18,765
for $2,000.

778
00:58:18,995 --> 00:58:20,668
Don't worry,

779
00:58:20,930 --> 00:58:23,035
your little secret is safe with me.

780
00:58:23,266 --> 00:58:24,939
So is yours.

781
00:58:39,182 --> 00:58:40,718
All right, here we go.

782
00:58:40,984 --> 00:58:42,930
Text sent at 7:21 pm.

783
00:58:43,152 --> 00:58:44,529
To an unidentified number.

784
00:58:44,787 --> 00:58:46,994
Fantastic. It says here
to meet me at Bellevue Park.

785
00:58:47,257 --> 00:58:48,531
Lover's Lane.

786
00:58:48,758 --> 00:58:49,896
- Yeah.
- Great.

787
00:58:50,126 --> 00:58:51,571
It's Peters.

788
00:58:51,794 --> 00:58:53,355
Need a team to meet us
at Bellevue Park.

789
00:58:53,363 --> 00:58:55,036
Got it.
Lets go.

790
00:58:55,298 --> 00:58:57,073
All right.
Thank you, sir.

791
00:59:34,971 --> 00:59:38,577
Someone didn't make much of an
effort to him or his wheels.

792
00:59:38,808 --> 00:59:41,187
Yeah, it looks like they were in a bit
of a hurry to get out of here, huh?

793
00:59:41,411 --> 00:59:42,890
What's forensics say?

794
00:59:43,146 --> 00:59:44,921
Not a hell of a whole lot, actually.

795
00:59:45,148 --> 00:59:47,594
But whoever did this
is one sick son of a bitch.

796
00:59:47,817 --> 00:59:49,854
I mean, look at this poor kid.

797
00:59:50,086 --> 00:59:51,326
You want me to call the family?

798
00:59:51,421 --> 00:59:54,630
No. No, I'll do it.

799
01:00:00,096 --> 01:00:02,235
Oh, my God.

800
01:00:02,498 --> 01:00:03,670
Yes, we'll be right there.

801
01:00:03,900 --> 01:00:05,345
Thanks.

802
01:00:08,171 --> 01:00:10,014
I'm done with my homework.

803
01:00:11,507 --> 01:00:12,815
What's wrong?

804
01:00:13,042 --> 01:00:15,249
Honey, sit down.

805
01:00:17,847 --> 01:00:19,952
That was detective Allen
from the police department.

806
01:00:20,183 --> 01:00:22,356
They're at Danny's house.

807
01:00:22,585 --> 01:00:24,758
Danny's house?

808
01:00:25,021 --> 01:00:26,227
Why?

809
01:00:26,456 --> 01:00:27,856
They don't have
all the details yet,

810
01:00:28,091 --> 01:00:29,851
but they need us to come
down to the station.

811
01:00:29,859 --> 01:00:31,304
Mom, just tell me what happened.

812
01:00:33,229 --> 01:00:35,106
Honey,

813
01:00:35,365 --> 01:00:37,367
Danny's dead.

814
01:00:43,373 --> 01:00:44,875
What?

815
01:00:45,108 --> 01:00:47,987
They found his body
in Bellevue Park.

816
01:00:59,288 --> 01:01:01,894
- What did you do to him?
- Excuse me?

817
01:01:02,125 --> 01:01:03,661
Danny said he was gonna
go see you last night.

818
01:01:03,926 --> 01:01:05,064
Were you drunk, is that it?

819
01:01:05,294 --> 01:01:07,495
Just so angry with him that
he was gonna end it with you

820
01:01:07,597 --> 01:01:10,908
the you ran over him with your car?
Is that what you did?!

821
01:01:11,134 --> 01:01:13,239
Is that the way you raise your daughter?
Why am I not surprised?

822
01:01:13,469 --> 01:01:14,948
Calm down.
Hey, hey, hey, calm down.

823
01:01:15,171 --> 01:01:18,175
Listen, I'm detective Allen.
This is detective Peters.

824
01:01:18,441 --> 01:01:20,045
We talked on the phone earlier.

825
01:01:20,276 --> 01:01:22,196
If you wouldn't mind just
following me over here.

826
01:01:22,345 --> 01:01:23,983
Yeah, if you wouldn't
mind having a seat

827
01:01:24,247 --> 01:01:25,385
right here, I'll have somebody
get you some water.

828
01:01:25,615 --> 01:01:28,221
Just right here.
Just for a few minutes, okay?

829
01:01:30,486 --> 01:01:32,659
Jamie, when was the last
time you saw Danny Campbell?

830
01:01:32,922 --> 01:01:34,196
At school.

831
01:01:34,424 --> 01:01:36,700
Um, around three.

832
01:01:36,926 --> 01:01:38,234
Did you talk to him?

833
01:01:38,461 --> 01:01:39,769
Yeah.

834
01:01:39,996 --> 01:01:41,441
Well, what did he say?

835
01:01:41,664 --> 01:01:47,139
He said he was gonna come
by, and he never showed up.

836
01:01:47,370 --> 01:01:49,475
And that's it?

837
01:01:52,442 --> 01:01:57,419
He also said that he was gonna
take care of something.

838
01:01:59,182 --> 01:02:00,889
What was that?

839
01:02:02,518 --> 01:02:04,862
It's okay, honey.
Go ahead.

840
01:02:06,189 --> 01:02:07,190
He said he was gonna

841
01:02:07,457 --> 01:02:09,437
break up with his girlfriend.

842
01:02:09,659 --> 01:02:11,764
Jamie, I thought
you were his girlfriend.

843
01:02:11,994 --> 01:02:13,473
He was seeing someone else.

844
01:02:15,832 --> 01:02:17,334
Any idea who?

845
01:02:22,972 --> 01:02:25,680
Our teacher, Miss Matson.

846
01:02:25,908 --> 01:02:27,114
What?

847
01:02:27,376 --> 01:02:29,083
Jamie, do you have
any proof of that?

848
01:02:29,345 --> 01:02:33,382
He told me, and I
saw them together.

849
01:02:33,649 --> 01:02:34,457
Okay, where?

850
01:02:34,684 --> 01:02:36,027
At her house.

851
01:02:37,553 --> 01:02:39,394
Mr. and Mrs. hall,
you knew nothing about this?

852
01:02:39,522 --> 01:02:41,058
- No.
- No.

853
01:02:41,324 --> 01:02:44,129
Hey, Jamie, so you never mentioned
any of this to your family,

854
01:02:44,360 --> 01:02:46,280
to your parents,
or to any high school officials?

855
01:02:47,363 --> 01:02:48,307
No.

856
01:02:48,531 --> 01:02:49,839
Why not?

857
01:02:51,334 --> 01:02:53,211
He didn't want me to.

858
01:03:25,134 --> 01:03:27,444
It's just-that's
such a horrible thing to say.

859
01:03:27,703 --> 01:03:30,206
I-I just... I can't believe it.

860
01:03:30,439 --> 01:03:32,319
So, Miss Matson, there was
nothing inappropriate

861
01:03:32,408 --> 01:03:34,410
about your relationship
with Danny Campbell then?

862
01:03:34,644 --> 01:03:36,089
Oh, absolutely not.

863
01:03:36,312 --> 01:03:38,792
I would never do anything
to hurt any of my kids.

864
01:03:40,416 --> 01:03:43,124
Just the thought of
that is-is just so vile.

865
01:03:43,386 --> 01:03:45,923
So why do you think Jamie hall
made this accusation?

866
01:03:46,155 --> 01:03:50,297
I don't know. She's one
of my best students.

867
01:03:52,328 --> 01:03:54,831
Although, I will say that

868
01:03:55,097 --> 01:03:59,078
she has had a change in
behavior the past couple weeks.

869
01:03:59,302 --> 01:04:00,474
Such as?

870
01:04:00,736 --> 01:04:03,410
She's become
increasingly belligerent.

871
01:04:03,639 --> 01:04:06,916
We had an episode a few days ago.

872
01:04:07,143 --> 01:04:08,451
Go on.

873
01:04:08,678 --> 01:04:10,487
She got a bad grade on a paper,

874
01:04:10,746 --> 01:04:13,522
and... she almost threatened me.

875
01:04:13,749 --> 01:04:16,496
Sort of. She said you will
never get away with this.

876
01:04:16,752 --> 01:04:19,130
And did you discuss this
with anybody?

877
01:04:19,355 --> 01:04:21,198
Yes, I did, principal Jenkins.

878
01:04:21,457 --> 01:04:24,563
And we decided not
to do anything about it.

879
01:04:24,794 --> 01:04:27,400
We thought, you know,
it's due to stress.

880
01:04:27,630 --> 01:04:29,166
You know, family problems.

881
01:04:29,432 --> 01:04:31,537
Her father's out of work.

882
01:04:31,767 --> 01:04:33,303
Danny.

883
01:04:33,536 --> 01:04:35,209
Miss Matson,
if you could be so kind

884
01:04:35,471 --> 01:04:37,917
as to tell us about
her problems with Danny.

885
01:04:38,140 --> 01:04:39,141
Oh, I-I I don't know.

886
01:04:39,375 --> 01:04:40,820
I obviously don't pay attention

887
01:04:41,043 --> 01:04:45,150
to the teenage dramas that
swirl around high school.

888
01:04:45,381 --> 01:04:48,021
But I did overhear that

889
01:04:48,284 --> 01:04:52,566
Jamie was accusing Danny of,
um, seeing someone else.

890
01:04:54,857 --> 01:04:57,337
Who knew it was me?

891
01:04:57,560 --> 01:04:58,538
Oh, I almost forgot.

892
01:04:58,794 --> 01:05:00,355
Miss Matson,
where were you Friday night

893
01:05:00,363 --> 01:05:02,400
between the hours
of 7:30 and 10:00 P.M.?

894
01:05:03,699 --> 01:05:06,305
Friday?
I was at the movies.

895
01:05:06,535 --> 01:05:08,879
Oh yeah?
What did you see?

896
01:05:09,138 --> 01:05:11,175
I saw BlackBerry Winter,

897
01:05:11,407 --> 01:05:16,413
actually, down at the
Broadway palace downtown.

898
01:05:16,679 --> 01:05:18,454
You know, because
I love those old theaters.

899
01:05:18,681 --> 01:05:22,095
You wouldn't happen to still have
that ticket stub, would you?

900
01:05:22,318 --> 01:05:25,265
I don't know.
I think I might, actually.

901
01:05:32,762 --> 01:05:34,935
Yep, BlackBerry Winter,

902
01:05:35,197 --> 01:05:37,336
it says here.
And the time is there.

903
01:05:37,566 --> 01:05:39,341
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

904
01:05:41,337 --> 01:05:43,544
So it does.

905
01:05:47,410 --> 01:05:51,950
Okay, well, she was
acting a little weird.

906
01:05:52,214 --> 01:05:54,091
I mean,
Danny was blowing her off,

907
01:05:54,350 --> 01:05:57,059
but she was taking it like he was
cheating on her or something.

908
01:05:57,286 --> 01:05:58,230
Was he?

909
01:05:58,454 --> 01:06:00,934
No, not that I know of.

910
01:06:01,190 --> 01:06:03,329
She even followed him
home one day.

911
01:06:03,559 --> 01:06:06,165
And I told her that
was crazy, and I was right.

912
01:06:06,395 --> 01:06:08,341
She said she didn't
catch him doing anything.

913
01:06:08,564 --> 01:06:11,067
So she admitted to you that she
never saw him with anyone else?

914
01:06:11,300 --> 01:06:12,438
Yeah.

915
01:06:12,702 --> 01:06:16,010
What was her general disposition that
day at school, the day Danny died?

916
01:06:16,272 --> 01:06:18,616
I'd say she was sort of

917
01:06:18,874 --> 01:06:20,911
pissed off.

918
01:06:21,143 --> 01:06:22,704
I'm just saying,
I'm not buying the fact

919
01:06:22,878 --> 01:06:24,653
that he was sleeping
with his teacher.

920
01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:27,053
Well, it's Jamie's word
against Molly's.

921
01:06:27,283 --> 01:06:29,924
But we do know that Jamie was angry at
Molly for giving her the bad grade.

922
01:06:30,152 --> 01:06:31,927
Okay,
what do we have here, right?

923
01:06:32,154 --> 01:06:33,963
The key to this whole case is
this prepaid cell phone, right?

924
01:06:34,223 --> 01:06:38,033
If we can find out who Danny sent
that text to, we got our killer.

925
01:06:38,260 --> 01:06:39,500
Well, I say we start with Jamie.

926
01:06:39,628 --> 01:06:41,148
She's the only one
with a clear motive.

927
01:06:41,230 --> 01:06:42,368
And the only one
who can't prove to us

928
01:06:42,598 --> 01:06:44,373
her whereabouts between
eight and ten P.M.

929
01:06:44,600 --> 01:06:45,601
On the night of the murder, right?

930
01:06:45,835 --> 01:06:48,145
Right.
Think we got enough?

931
01:06:48,404 --> 01:06:50,213
- Yeah, just enough.
- Yeah.

932
01:06:50,439 --> 01:06:51,543
- Calling it in?
- Yep.

933
01:06:51,774 --> 01:06:53,651
- Lieutenant Ryan.
- Gonna need a warrant.

934
01:06:53,909 --> 01:06:55,411
Location?
The hall residence.

935
01:07:01,617 --> 01:07:03,497
Nice to see you again.
We have a search warrant.

936
01:07:03,686 --> 01:07:04,994
- What?
- Yep.

937
01:07:05,254 --> 01:07:07,934
No, you can't just come in here
and start searching my place.

938
01:07:08,157 --> 01:07:09,317
No, Jamie didn't do anything.

939
01:07:09,525 --> 01:07:10,725
She's been really cooperative.

940
01:07:10,960 --> 01:07:12,997
She's told you everything
that she knows.

941
01:07:13,262 --> 01:07:14,468
Mom, whats going on?

942
01:07:14,697 --> 01:07:16,258
The detectives brought
a search warrant.

943
01:07:16,432 --> 01:07:17,433
Why?

944
01:07:17,666 --> 01:07:19,027
That's exactly
what I want to know.

945
01:07:19,268 --> 01:07:21,077
Folks, please,
let's just calm down, okay?

946
01:07:21,303 --> 01:07:22,783
This is just part
of an investigation.

947
01:07:22,938 --> 01:07:25,619
Now if you're telling us the truth,
we'll be out of here in no time.

948
01:07:25,841 --> 01:07:28,076
And you could really help us out
if you gave us your cell phone.

949
01:07:28,210 --> 01:07:29,348
I don't have one.

950
01:07:29,612 --> 01:07:30,716
Yeah, that's right,
we took it away

951
01:07:30,946 --> 01:07:32,653
- a couple months ago.
- Uh-huh.

952
01:07:32,882 --> 01:07:34,522
- I think I'll check the car.
- Good idea.

953
01:07:34,617 --> 01:07:37,063
- Excuse me.
- I'll check the living room.

954
01:07:38,454 --> 01:07:41,492
Jamie, are you telling us
everything you know?

955
01:07:41,724 --> 01:07:43,328
Mom,
I don't know what's going on.

956
01:07:43,559 --> 01:07:45,402
You know what, I'm gonna
call our lawyer.

957
01:07:47,229 --> 01:07:48,435
Hey, check this out.

958
01:07:48,697 --> 01:07:51,200
Yeah?
What you got?

959
01:07:51,467 --> 01:07:54,243
This, right here.

960
01:07:54,470 --> 01:07:55,471
Ken. Ken.

961
01:07:55,704 --> 01:07:56,705
Yeah.

962
01:07:56,972 --> 01:07:59,680
There's something
you should see.

963
01:07:59,909 --> 01:08:00,751
What do you got?

964
01:08:01,010 --> 01:08:02,489
Check out the front bumper.

965
01:08:12,354 --> 01:08:14,334
This is your car,
isn't it, Jamie?

966
01:08:14,557 --> 01:08:16,264
Yes.

967
01:08:16,525 --> 01:08:19,233
That looks like you got some
dried blood on your bumper.

968
01:08:21,597 --> 01:08:22,837
I don't know
how that got there.

969
01:08:22,865 --> 01:08:24,538
Jamie, what happened?

970
01:08:24,767 --> 01:08:26,041
What is that?

971
01:08:26,268 --> 01:08:27,303
- Did you hit something, honey?
- No.

972
01:08:27,570 --> 01:08:28,708
- Ken.
- Yeah?

973
01:08:28,938 --> 01:08:30,542
I've never seen that before.

974
01:08:32,708 --> 01:08:34,549
- Where was that?
- Jamie, did you buy a phone?

975
01:08:34,577 --> 01:08:36,079
No, I didn't.
That's not mine.

976
01:08:38,914 --> 01:08:40,393
We got what we need.

977
01:08:40,616 --> 01:08:42,061
Bag it.

978
01:08:42,284 --> 01:08:44,004
- You're under arrest.
- What are you doing?

979
01:08:44,019 --> 01:08:45,464
Hold on, detective.

980
01:08:45,688 --> 01:08:46,632
- Mom?
- Anything you say can and will

981
01:08:46,856 --> 01:08:48,529
be used against you
in a court of law.

982
01:08:48,757 --> 01:08:50,134
Mom?!

983
01:08:50,392 --> 01:08:51,713
You have the right
to an attorney.

984
01:08:51,727 --> 01:08:54,727
If you can't afford one, it will be
provided to you at the public's expense.

985
01:08:54,864 --> 01:08:57,470
Mom!

986
01:08:59,635 --> 01:09:01,239
Jamie!
Jamie!

987
01:09:01,470 --> 01:09:02,778
- Mom!
- Jamie!

988
01:09:05,641 --> 01:09:07,416
Good.

989
01:09:07,643 --> 01:09:10,123
Get some sleep,
and we'll see you tomorrow.

990
01:09:13,782 --> 01:09:15,261
Danny's got a girlfriend.

991
01:09:15,484 --> 01:09:16,792
I know. What was that
about the school teacher?

992
01:09:17,052 --> 01:09:18,827
- There he is.
- How is she?

993
01:09:19,054 --> 01:09:22,333
She's fine. They're gonna hold her over
night until the bail hearing tomorrow.

994
01:09:22,591 --> 01:09:23,865
Will she be safe?

995
01:09:24,093 --> 01:09:25,414
They'll put her in a private cell.

996
01:09:25,628 --> 01:09:26,504
She won't have to mix
with the general

997
01:09:26,762 --> 01:09:28,105
population.
I made sure of that.

998
01:09:28,330 --> 01:09:29,570
Can-can we get her
out tomorrow?

999
01:09:29,732 --> 01:09:32,679
Well, the D.A. Has
a compelling case.

1000
01:09:32,902 --> 01:09:37,041
The blood they found on Jamie's bumper
was positively identified as Danny's.

1001
01:09:37,306 --> 01:09:38,478
Oh, my God.

1002
01:09:38,741 --> 01:09:40,261
Couldn't have someone
planted it there,

1003
01:09:40,409 --> 01:09:41,547
- and the phone?
- Yes.

1004
01:09:41,777 --> 01:09:44,382
And these are the arguments
I'll be making tomorrow.

1005
01:09:44,613 --> 01:09:45,717
Along with the fact that
she's an honor's student.

1006
01:09:45,948 --> 01:09:47,427
She's got no priors.

1007
01:09:47,650 --> 01:09:50,522
I think there's a good chance
the judge'll grant our request.

1008
01:09:50,753 --> 01:09:52,528
Don, how much will all this cost?

1009
01:09:52,755 --> 01:09:55,895
For manslaughter,
this statute is 100,000.

1010
01:09:56,125 --> 01:09:59,436
And so you'll need
50 grand to make bail.

1011
01:10:01,030 --> 01:10:02,566
Okay?

1012
01:10:03,866 --> 01:10:05,345
Okay.

1013
01:10:08,604 --> 01:10:10,743
Thanks, Carl.
I'm sorry to call you so late.

1014
01:10:10,973 --> 01:10:12,646
It's all right.
But you know what we're up against.

1015
01:10:12,875 --> 01:10:13,259
Yeah.

1016
01:10:13,285 --> 01:10:14,795
All right, so I'll see
you in the morning.

1017
01:10:14,810 --> 01:10:16,414
- Take care.
- I really appreciate it.

1018
01:10:16,645 --> 01:10:17,487
Bye bye.

1019
01:10:17,713 --> 01:10:18,714
What happened?

1020
01:10:18,981 --> 01:10:20,517
Thank God for my brother.

1021
01:10:20,783 --> 01:10:24,222
Between him and my parents, and whatever
we can borrow off our credit cards,

1022
01:10:24,453 --> 01:10:26,956
I think we can come up
with the 50k.

1023
01:10:27,189 --> 01:10:29,226
Thank God.

1024
01:10:41,070 --> 01:10:43,243
Hall was arrested

1025
01:10:43,505 --> 01:10:46,028
in connection with the hit and run
death of what we have since learned

1026
01:10:46,242 --> 01:10:48,244
was her boyfriend, Danny Campbell.

1027
01:10:48,510 --> 01:10:51,684
And while police are saying
very little about the charges,

1028
01:10:51,914 --> 01:10:53,954
we have learned that a bail
hearing has now been set

1029
01:10:53,983 --> 01:10:55,587
for 11:00 tomorrow morning.

1030
01:10:55,818 --> 01:10:58,264
We'll of course be here
and have a live report for you.

1031
01:10:58,487 --> 01:11:00,088
For now though,
from Wilfred High School,

1032
01:11:00,189 --> 01:11:02,499
I'm Rick chambers.
Let's go back to the studio.

1033
01:11:40,462 --> 01:11:42,442
Look at this thing.

1034
01:11:42,698 --> 01:11:44,575
I feel like a dog on a chain.

1035
01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:46,336
Yeah, well, according to don,

1036
01:11:46,602 --> 01:11:48,548
we're lucky the judge
let you out at all.

1037
01:11:48,771 --> 01:11:50,375
So I think that's
a small price to pay.

1038
01:11:50,606 --> 01:11:53,587
So, I-I can't leave the house,
at all?

1039
01:11:53,809 --> 01:11:54,913
Not until the trial.

1040
01:11:55,144 --> 01:11:56,452
But that could be months.

1041
01:11:56,712 --> 01:12:00,719
Your mom and I are doing everything
we can to get you out of this.

1042
01:12:00,949 --> 01:12:02,485
Did they question Miss Matson?

1043
01:12:05,120 --> 01:12:06,895
Apparently so.

1044
01:12:07,122 --> 01:12:08,294
And?

1045
01:12:08,557 --> 01:12:10,002
She's got an alibi.

1046
01:12:10,225 --> 01:12:11,863
Well, she's lying.

1047
01:12:12,094 --> 01:12:14,700
Danny told me he was
gonna go see her that night.

1048
01:12:14,930 --> 01:12:16,409
She's the one who killed him.

1049
01:12:16,632 --> 01:12:19,277
No, honey, we believe you,
it's just the police have nothing

1050
01:12:19,501 --> 01:12:20,946
to connect her to the crime.

1051
01:12:22,604 --> 01:12:23,912
Did they check her car?

1052
01:12:24,139 --> 01:12:25,345
I don't know.

1053
01:12:25,607 --> 01:12:28,450
Well, there has to be some
sort of evidence in it.

1054
01:12:28,677 --> 01:12:30,679
And if the police won't look,

1055
01:12:30,946 --> 01:12:32,948
then maybe we should
look ourselves.

1056
01:12:59,975 --> 01:13:02,751
Okay.

1057
01:13:04,179 --> 01:13:05,988
Miss Matson.

1058
01:13:07,216 --> 01:13:08,661
Yes, may I help you?

1059
01:13:08,884 --> 01:13:10,886
I'm Lauren hall.

1060
01:13:12,020 --> 01:13:13,363
Jamie's mother.

1061
01:13:13,622 --> 01:13:14,657
Oh!

1062
01:13:16,825 --> 01:13:21,871
Are you here to, uh,
pick up her homework?

1063
01:13:22,131 --> 01:13:23,804
Something like that.

1064
01:13:24,032 --> 01:13:26,512
How is she?

1065
01:13:26,735 --> 01:13:27,736
Not good.

1066
01:13:28,003 --> 01:13:29,641
She spent the night in jail.

1067
01:13:29,872 --> 01:13:32,011
Oh. I heard about that.

1068
01:13:32,241 --> 01:13:33,515
I'm so sorry.

1069
01:13:33,742 --> 01:13:35,517
- Miss Matson...
- Mm-hmm?

1070
01:13:35,744 --> 01:13:38,384
Someone's trying to frame
my daughter for murder.

1071
01:13:38,647 --> 01:13:40,627
Really?

1072
01:13:40,849 --> 01:13:42,954
Who would do such a thing?

1073
01:13:44,653 --> 01:13:46,599
I don't know.

1074
01:13:46,822 --> 01:13:48,130
Maybe you.

1075
01:13:50,759 --> 01:13:53,433
Uh, Mrs. hall,

1076
01:13:53,695 --> 01:13:55,641
I really resent that.

1077
01:13:55,864 --> 01:13:59,179
The police have investigated this,
and I have been completely exonerated.

1078
01:13:59,201 --> 01:14:01,044
She saw you with Danny.

1079
01:14:01,270 --> 01:14:04,505
Your her mother, of course
you're gonna believe her.

1080
01:14:04,673 --> 01:14:06,846
I can assure you,
she's making that up.

1081
01:14:07,075 --> 01:14:10,613
You know, I never held Jamie's
accusations against her.

1082
01:14:10,879 --> 01:14:13,723
Even after Danny told me the
trouble that they were having.

1083
01:14:13,949 --> 01:14:15,826
And you know why?

1084
01:14:16,084 --> 01:14:20,430
Because I know about
love, young love.

1085
01:14:20,689 --> 01:14:24,967
And that makes people say
and do crazy things.

1086
01:14:25,194 --> 01:14:27,140
So Danny confided in you?

1087
01:14:28,564 --> 01:14:30,009
No.

1088
01:14:30,232 --> 01:14:32,041
He was looking for
someone to talk to.

1089
01:14:32,267 --> 01:14:35,578
Oh, and lucky for him,
you were there.

1090
01:14:36,872 --> 01:14:38,852
Or was it luck?

1091
01:14:41,376 --> 01:14:44,914
Mrs. hall, I have
a faculty meeting right now,

1092
01:14:45,147 --> 01:14:47,024
so I'll have her homework ready

1093
01:14:47,282 --> 01:14:48,625
for you to pick up tomorrow.

1094
01:14:48,884 --> 01:14:50,830
See you then.

1095
01:14:51,053 --> 01:14:51,997
Sure.

1096
01:16:06,962 --> 01:16:08,805
Your destination.

1097
01:16:25,380 --> 01:16:26,859
Hey.
Um, are you Gino?

1098
01:16:27,082 --> 01:16:28,527
Yeah.

1099
01:16:28,750 --> 01:16:30,190
I was wondering
if you could help me.

1100
01:16:30,319 --> 01:16:31,923
Was there a car
that was brought in,

1101
01:16:32,154 --> 01:16:34,100
sometime this week,
it was like a silver jeep,

1102
01:16:34,323 --> 01:16:38,135
a license plate "4D0Q67B"?

1103
01:16:38,360 --> 01:16:39,668
Sorry, don't ring a bell.

1104
01:16:39,895 --> 01:16:41,101
Are you sure?
A woman,

1105
01:16:41,363 --> 01:16:43,036
dark hair, attractive?
She may have brought it in

1106
01:16:43,265 --> 01:16:44,801
with some damage
to the front end?

1107
01:16:45,067 --> 01:16:46,705
Told you, I don't remember.

1108
01:16:46,935 --> 01:16:49,973
Look, my daughter
might go to jail

1109
01:16:50,238 --> 01:16:52,945
for a hit and run that she didn't commit
unless I prove that she didn't do it.

1110
01:16:53,208 --> 01:16:55,882
And I am sure that you
have the evidence here-

1111
01:16:56,111 --> 01:16:58,671
look, I don't need any cops snooping
around my place. You got it?

1112
01:16:58,847 --> 01:17:00,849
So like I said,
I don't remember.

1113
01:17:11,026 --> 01:17:12,801
Hey.

1114
01:17:13,028 --> 01:17:15,736
- I know the chick you're talking about.
- You do?

1115
01:17:15,964 --> 01:17:17,671
Yeah, skinny bitch
with hot pink lips,

1116
01:17:17,933 --> 01:17:19,213
came in here with a broken grill.

1117
01:17:19,434 --> 01:17:20,538
Do you still have it?

1118
01:17:20,769 --> 01:17:21,747
Not any more.

1119
01:17:21,970 --> 01:17:23,574
It went to scrap three days ago.

1120
01:17:25,140 --> 01:17:27,643
So is it true, this chick
really hit someone?

1121
01:17:27,909 --> 01:17:29,354
A young man.

1122
01:17:29,578 --> 01:17:32,024
My daughter's being blamed for it.

1123
01:17:32,247 --> 01:17:33,692
Are you sure you can't help me?

1124
01:17:33,915 --> 01:17:36,204
You think you can talk to the
police and tell them what you know?

1125
01:17:36,218 --> 01:17:38,027
If I talk, I'm out of a job.

1126
01:17:38,253 --> 01:17:40,130
I got kids, too.

1127
01:18:18,160 --> 01:18:20,663
She was there, Steven.

1128
01:18:20,929 --> 01:18:23,040
The owner, Gino, he didn't
want to talk about it,

1129
01:18:23,298 --> 01:18:27,036
but his mechanic, she was
telling me everything.

1130
01:18:27,302 --> 01:18:29,339
She confirmed that
Molly dropped her car off

1131
01:18:29,604 --> 01:18:31,083
Saturday morning.

1132
01:18:31,306 --> 01:18:33,818
The grill on her car, that's the
only evidence we would have,

1133
01:18:34,042 --> 01:18:36,822
but I guess that was hauled
off, what, three days ago.

1134
01:18:37,045 --> 01:18:38,388
Other than getting her
to confess,

1135
01:18:38,647 --> 01:18:40,024
there's nothing we can do.

1136
01:18:41,516 --> 01:18:43,052
Then let's do it.

1137
01:18:44,286 --> 01:18:45,321
Do what?

1138
01:18:45,554 --> 01:18:48,160
Let's get her to confess.

1139
01:18:48,390 --> 01:18:50,199
I mean, if I confront her,
maybe she'll...

1140
01:18:50,459 --> 01:18:52,132
No, no, no, I don't want you
anywhere near that woman.

1141
01:18:52,360 --> 01:18:53,361
And besides,
you can't leave the house

1142
01:18:53,628 --> 01:18:54,936
with that thing on your ankle.

1143
01:18:55,163 --> 01:18:57,336
The police'll track
you down in 10 minutes.

1144
01:19:04,873 --> 01:19:06,910
I did that.

1145
01:19:09,377 --> 01:19:11,152
I'm so stupid!

1146
01:19:11,379 --> 01:19:14,223
Okay, what am I gonna do?

1147
01:19:14,483 --> 01:19:17,362
What do I do? I mean,
I have to cover my tracks!

1148
01:19:17,586 --> 01:19:18,690
You idiot!

1149
01:19:18,920 --> 01:19:20,695
Okay, where are you?
Where are you?

1150
01:19:20,922 --> 01:19:22,196
I'm here. Okay.

1151
01:19:22,424 --> 01:19:23,266
My head hurts.

1152
01:19:23,525 --> 01:19:25,061
What did I do wrong?
Stupid!

1153
01:19:25,327 --> 01:19:26,829
Shut up!

1154
01:19:27,062 --> 01:19:28,370
Ugly little girl.

1155
01:19:30,165 --> 01:19:31,940
Ugly little girl.

1156
01:19:32,167 --> 01:19:33,840
Ugly! Ugly! Ugly! Ugly!

1157
01:19:34,069 --> 01:19:35,275
Shut up!

1158
01:19:42,878 --> 01:19:44,755
We could go back to Brad,
I don't know.

1159
01:19:45,013 --> 01:19:46,390
We could get money from Brad.

1160
01:19:46,615 --> 01:19:48,253
I don't think that's a good idea.

1161
01:19:48,517 --> 01:19:50,360
I mean, I could try him.

1162
01:19:50,585 --> 01:19:54,195
Okay, but still, it all takes money,
honey, and we don't have the money.

1163
01:19:54,422 --> 01:19:56,026
We have to think of other options.

1164
01:19:56,258 --> 01:19:57,794
I don't know
what to do anymore.

1165
01:19:58,059 --> 01:20:01,366
Look, we know that she's innocent,
and we just have to keep fighting.

1166
01:20:01,596 --> 01:20:04,834
This is one of those surreal moments
you think this has got to be made up.

1167
01:20:05,100 --> 01:20:08,809
I know, I know.

1168
01:20:35,430 --> 01:20:36,966
Jamie.

1169
01:20:38,266 --> 01:20:39,472
What are you doing?

1170
01:20:39,734 --> 01:20:41,338
Hey.

1171
01:20:41,570 --> 01:20:43,290
We need to talk about
your good friend Gino.

1172
01:20:43,471 --> 01:20:46,247
You know, the one
who runs the chop shop.

1173
01:20:47,642 --> 01:20:49,019
What?

1174
01:20:49,277 --> 01:20:51,416
We have the grill.

1175
01:20:51,646 --> 01:20:54,350
You know, the one you replaced
the day after you killed Danny?

1176
01:20:54,616 --> 01:20:56,926
Oh, I don't...

1177
01:20:57,152 --> 01:20:58,495
They didn't haul it off
like they told you.

1178
01:20:58,753 --> 01:21:00,130
They kept it.

1179
01:21:00,355 --> 01:21:01,891
That's not true.

1180
01:21:02,157 --> 01:21:03,363
Gino gave it to my mom.

1181
01:21:03,625 --> 01:21:05,434
She's on her way
to the police right now.

1182
01:21:05,660 --> 01:21:07,936
I'm sure there's plenty
of evidence on it.

1183
01:21:08,163 --> 01:21:10,302
No, there's not.
I didn't do anything.

1184
01:21:10,532 --> 01:21:13,138
Why, did you wipe it off?

1185
01:21:13,368 --> 01:21:16,815
The same way you wiped
the blood on my bumper?

1186
01:21:17,038 --> 01:21:19,199
Okay, I-I I'm not gonna listen to this.
You need to go.

1187
01:21:19,274 --> 01:21:22,950
You put that blood on my car, and stashed
the phone in the glove compartment.

1188
01:21:23,044 --> 01:21:25,388
No, I didn't. You're crazy!
Get out of my house.

1189
01:21:25,647 --> 01:21:27,320
Why did you kill him,
Molly, huh?

1190
01:21:27,549 --> 01:21:29,324
- What?
- Was he gonna tell on you?

1191
01:21:29,551 --> 01:21:32,157
Was he gonna get you
fired from your job?

1192
01:21:32,387 --> 01:21:35,368
If you have the grill,
why are you telling me this?

1193
01:21:39,127 --> 01:21:43,132
You're trying
to get me to say something.

1194
01:21:43,365 --> 01:21:45,402
What, are you trying
to trick me or something?

1195
01:21:45,667 --> 01:21:47,340
What is this?

1196
01:21:49,704 --> 01:21:50,512
You were.

1197
01:21:51,640 --> 01:21:53,642
Yah!

1198
01:21:53,875 --> 01:21:56,685
You're trying to record
my confession?

1199
01:21:56,912 --> 01:21:58,619
Get out of my house!

1200
01:21:58,880 --> 01:22:00,382
He didn't want you.

1201
01:22:00,649 --> 01:22:05,254
He used you like a whore he used you
to get what he thought he needed.

1202
01:22:05,520 --> 01:22:06,128
Uh-huh.

1203
01:22:06,154 --> 01:22:08,583
He told me what he
really thought of you.

1204
01:22:08,823 --> 01:22:14,136
He said you were a crazy old
lady, that you disgusted him.

1205
01:22:14,362 --> 01:22:18,333
And how long did you think
he was really gonna be with you?

1206
01:22:18,566 --> 01:22:21,206
Look at you.

1207
01:22:23,438 --> 01:22:25,076
You're pathetic.

1208
01:22:26,708 --> 01:22:29,587
That's not true.
Danny wanted me!

1209
01:22:31,212 --> 01:22:35,091
You think because you're
so pretty and so popular

1210
01:22:35,350 --> 01:22:37,023
that you're better than I am?!

1211
01:22:37,252 --> 01:22:40,132
You-you think who would want
to be with poor, ugly Molly?

1212
01:22:40,355 --> 01:22:42,028
He wanted to be with me!

1213
01:22:42,257 --> 01:22:45,632
But because you interfered,
he's not with me anymore.

1214
01:22:45,894 --> 01:22:48,431
You stupid, selfish little-

1215
01:22:53,702 --> 01:22:56,376
oh, you cut my face.

1216
01:23:06,548 --> 01:23:10,018
Oh, look who's pathetic now.

1217
01:23:10,251 --> 01:23:12,128
Don't like that, do you?

1218
01:23:12,387 --> 01:23:13,991
You know what, I can't believe

1219
01:23:14,222 --> 01:23:18,464
that Danny made such a
stupid mistake, for this?

1220
01:23:18,727 --> 01:23:20,229
Danny got what he deserved.

1221
01:23:20,462 --> 01:23:21,497
And now, you...

1222
01:23:25,467 --> 01:23:27,413
Oh, God! Detective!
I'm go glad!

1223
01:23:27,635 --> 01:23:30,195
She broke into my house... Stop!
Listen, she's telling the truth,

1224
01:23:30,438 --> 01:23:31,610
and I heard everything
you said about Danny,

1225
01:23:31,840 --> 01:23:33,480
- so stop it, okay?
- No, this is her fault!

1226
01:23:33,508 --> 01:23:35,588
- She cut me!
- Miss Matson, I need you to calm down.

1227
01:23:35,677 --> 01:23:40,285
Please, calm down, okay?

1228
01:23:40,515 --> 01:23:42,188
Okay?

1229
01:23:43,485 --> 01:23:44,691
Okay.

1230
01:23:46,654 --> 01:23:48,190
Now, are you all right?

1231
01:23:48,456 --> 01:23:49,662
You're not hurt or anything?

1232
01:24:00,602 --> 01:24:02,104
Don't move!

1233
01:24:03,772 --> 01:24:06,252
You don't know what
to do with a gun.

1234
01:24:06,474 --> 01:24:07,976
Wanna bet?

1235
01:24:15,884 --> 01:24:17,363
Hey, it's okay.

1236
01:24:17,619 --> 01:24:19,121
I can handle it.

1237
01:24:32,233 --> 01:24:34,679
We were worried.
Here she comes.

1238
01:24:50,218 --> 01:24:52,220
Well, apparently,
this wasn't the first time.

1239
01:24:52,487 --> 01:24:55,093
She admitted to being involved
in a student affair back east,

1240
01:24:55,323 --> 01:24:56,631
but the district covered it up.

1241
01:24:56,858 --> 01:24:58,462
And she was able to move to L.A.,

1242
01:24:58,693 --> 01:25:00,413
and just get a job like
nothing ever happened?

1243
01:25:00,428 --> 01:25:03,136
She had the credentials.
That's all she needed.

1244
01:25:03,398 --> 01:25:05,105
What kind of sentence
will she get?

1245
01:25:05,366 --> 01:25:10,508
Manslaughter, and attacking a police
officer, I'd say 20, 25, easy.

1246
01:25:10,738 --> 01:25:12,339
Detective, I wanted
to ask you something.

1247
01:25:12,340 --> 01:25:13,512
Sure.

1248
01:25:13,741 --> 01:25:15,221
Why'd it take you
so long to get here?

1249
01:25:15,443 --> 01:25:16,786
My dad said it would
only take 10 minutes.

1250
01:25:17,045 --> 01:25:18,422
I was kinda counting on that.

1251
01:25:18,680 --> 01:25:20,387
You know what, Jamie,
the next time you wanna jump in,

1252
01:25:20,615 --> 01:25:22,720
I suggest you do it before
rush hour would be good.

1253
01:25:22,951 --> 01:25:25,761
Oh.

1254
01:25:26,020 --> 01:25:27,522
Let's go.

1255
01:25:36,430 --> 01:25:38,394
Down 17, the Nasdaq down 38...

1256
01:25:38,420 --> 01:25:40,394
- Hey, mom.
- Hey.

1257
01:25:40,902 --> 01:25:42,306
Is dad home yet?

1258
01:25:42,537 --> 01:25:45,144
Nope, but he promised he'd be home
from work in time for dinner.

1259
01:25:45,406 --> 01:25:47,443
Oh, by the way,

1260
01:25:47,709 --> 01:25:49,655
you got some mail today.

1261
01:25:59,287 --> 01:26:00,595
So...?

1262
01:26:00,822 --> 01:26:02,460
"We are happy to offer you

1263
01:26:02,724 --> 01:26:04,085
admission to Whittendale
University

1264
01:26:04,092 --> 01:26:07,369
and are delighted to have
you as our new student."

1265
01:26:07,595 --> 01:26:10,132
Oh, honey, I am so proud of you.

1266
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:13,536
The day after Molly Matson

1267
01:26:13,801 --> 01:26:15,405
was sentenced to prison
for manslaughter,

1268
01:26:15,637 --> 01:26:18,279
we asked a variety of
students how they might react

1269
01:26:18,506 --> 01:26:20,486
if confronted
with a teacher temptress.

1270
01:26:20,742 --> 01:26:24,357
Here's what John Ludlow from Litton
High School had to say. Take a look.

1271
01:26:24,579 --> 01:26:26,539
Well, if she looks anything
like that Miss Matson,

1272
01:26:26,614 --> 01:26:29,151
hell yeah, I'd let her
have her way with me.

1273
01:26:29,417 --> 01:26:30,862
I mean, look at her, she's hot.

1274
01:26:31,085 --> 01:26:33,361
If that were my teacher,
I'd never skip class.

1275
01:26:36,791 --> 01:26:39,294
Oh, that's sweet.

1276
01:26:39,527 --> 01:26:41,700
John.
