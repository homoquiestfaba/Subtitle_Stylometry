wasn't like your average

189
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:51,599
explosion.

190
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,899
It was a nuclear explosion.

191
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:56,599
So everything within a 12 mile
radius was devastated.

192
00:09:57,400 --> 00:10:00,299
Hence the name "Atomic Space
Bug." Exactly.

193
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,489
So do you think this new
meteorite is carrying that

194
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:03,399
type of creature?

195
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,799
There's a very good chance that
it is.

196
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:08,499
Shouldn't we alert the
authorities?

197
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,549
Well, we should but technically,
we're not allowed to.

198
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:14,099
Not allowed to. Why?

199
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:16,589
Because the government refuses
to acknowledge the fact that

200
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:20,489
there is any life form out in
the galaxy besides us, they

201
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:21,399
fear that if the

202
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:24,789
general public found out about
a creature like this, it would

203
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,099
be Widespread Panic.

204
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:27,299
So

205
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:28,439
what do we do now?

206
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:30,779
There's nothing we can do
except cross our fingers

207
00:10:30,950 --> 00:10:33,649
and hope it's not a repeat of
1953.

208
00:10:35,770 --> 00:10:38,039
(Traffic sounds)

209
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:40,499
Welcome to Fair Oaks.

210
00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:45,719
population 1,457

211
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:50,099
A small town situated in
Northern New York.

212
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,599
Like every Small Town,

213
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:55,499
Fair Oaks has a Main Street.

214
00:10:55,830 --> 00:10:57,629
on that Main Street,

215
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:01,189
you'll find the Old Clock Tower
built by Mayor Brown's

216
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,799
grandfather.

217
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,599
You'll also find Jerry's Barber
Shop

218
00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:08,399
where you can get a

219
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:10,499
haircut for 5 bucks.

220
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,819
Plus tip of course.

221
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:16,699
And stop by Doc Johnson's
Pharmacy.

222
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,199
Where you can pick up some
condoms,

223
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,299
So you don't knock Up Little
Susie

224
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:22,299
or

225
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,299
a morning-after pill,

226
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,499
just in case you do.

227
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:27,999
Fair Oaks

228
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,799
a small American Town,

229
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:37,189
like many others, except this
town is about to be terrorized

230
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:37,899
by

231
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:41,039
"THE ATOMIC SPACE BUG!"

232
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,599
Sheriff Frank Wilson is on his
daily beat.

233
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:51,859
(Traffic sounds.)

234
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:55,499
Three teens from New York City

235
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,599
Steven, Angela and Kevin

236
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:03,599
are on their way to stay at
Angela's grandfather's cabin.

237
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:06,699
Steve and Angela are exploring
the woods

238
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,099
as well as each other.

239
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:13,499
Kevin stayed behind to fix a
flat tire.

240
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,399
All are totally unprepared

241
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:18,899

242
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,899

sky.

New York City

251
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:46,799

252
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:47,999
I was wondering if

253
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,089
You can dispatch me a tow truck
or something? Yeah, City Folk

254

touch the fence we'll

came from.

752
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:05,899
Wait a minute. I'm not an
electrician.

753
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:07,159
I don't know anything about
this stuff.

754

It's simple

755
00:41:08,810 --> 00:41:10,709
I'll just hand it to you
through the gate

756
00:41:10,710 --> 00:41:12,199
You bring it in here and hook
it up to the screw.

757
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:14,029
Is that safe? I don't want to
get electrocuted.
