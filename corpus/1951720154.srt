00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:28,309
[boy] Hi. This is me. Junior Healy.

2
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:33,998
This is me and my dad, Ben Healy.
He's the best. I love him and he loves me.

3
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:40,429
This is my grandpa, Big Ben Healy.
He's old, wrinkly and mean.

4
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:44,275
Believe it or not,
some people think I'm a little devil.

5
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:46,670
But I'm not. I'm an angel.

6
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:48,990
An avenging angel.

7
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:50,718
In general, I like people.

8
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:57,115
I just got no patience for losers,
whiners, criers and biters.

9
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:00,951
This is Mortville Elementary School

10
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:04,476
where I'm currently serving
a five-year sentence.

11
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:07,996
And this fine specimen
is my teacher, Miss Hicks.

12
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:12,756
I hate Miss Hicks, and for some reason
she's not too fond of me either.

13
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:16,993
But don 't worry,
she's about to take an early retirement.

14
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:28,912
M ichelle. 'Geo-Thermal
Energy Is My Friend". A-plus.

15
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:37,912
Steve, "Frog to Fish
Liver Transplant". A-plus-plus.

16
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:41,839
Murph.

17
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:49,834
Potato art?. Well, at least this year you tried.

18
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,389
D... plus.

19
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:58,032
- Oh, yeah!
- Calm down, Murph.

20
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,911
And finally,

21
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:08,437
Iast and certainly least, Junior Healy.

22
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,670
Yes, Miss Hicks.

23
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:14,150
Don't "Yes, Miss Hicks" me,
you vile little hellion.

24
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:16,788
In all my 43 years of teaching,

25
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:21,238
I've never encountered a more sinister
presence in the classroom than you.

26
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:24,472
Well, it ain't been no picnic for me either.

27
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:28,918
Well, it seems that once again
you haven't completed your assignment.

28
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:32,231
Big surprise. Class...

29
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:37,269
..take a good long look at this lazy slacker
who's about to get an F.

30
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,635
[pupils] Oh...!

31
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:43,395
- Busted.
- Do you know what "F" stands for?.

32
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:46,791
It stands for "flunk", it stands for "failure".

33
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:52,553
- It also stands for "fat farm".
- What are you saying?.

34
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:57,748
I'm saying join the circus,
you'd make a fortune.

35
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:02,436
And besides, lady, I did do a science project.

36
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:05,672
- It's all about sound waves.
- Oh, right.

37
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:11,995
- And when do I get it?.
- Oh, it's coming. Any second now.

38
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,150
[ringing]

39
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,716
[pupils] Whey...!

40
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,431
- [pupils] Whoa!
- [screams]

41
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,395
Junior, I can't get this off!

42
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:36,120
I can't see! Junior...!

43
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:46,716
Going down?.

44
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,592
[groaning]

45
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:11,509
Naturally, that overgrown rat Murph squealed
on me and the Principal called my dad.

46
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:14,592
But as the poet said,
if you're gonna do the crime,

47
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:17,228
you're gonna do the time.

48
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:22,838
[blaring rock music on and off]

49
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:28,389
What's the big deal?. I never touched her.

50
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,870
- Accidents happen.
- Well, there's been a lot of accidents lately.

51
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:34,634
It's that time of year.

52
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,592
- You're mad at me, aren't you?.
- Yes, I am.

53
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:46,112
So you don't like me anymore?.

54
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:56,829
Junior, you know that no matter
what you do, I love you very much.

55
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,436
And I would do anything in the world for you.

56
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:03,831
But I just can't handle everything.

57
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,869
So I've decided that we need
someone special to talk to.

58
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:12,157
A shrink?.! Turn it around, pal!

59
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,880
[screaming, horn beeping]

60
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,712
[crash!]

61
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:21,673
- And what does this remind you of, Junior?.
- An ink blot.

62
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,831
Well... And this?.

63
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:30,435
Another ink blot.

64
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:33,876
OK. And this?.

65
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:38,997
A basket of warm, fuzzy, new-born kittens.

66
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:43,156
- Really?.
- Really?.

67
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:46,596
No, it's just another crummy ink blot!

68
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:50,389
How many times do I have to tell you, lady?.

69
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:54,553
Thank you, Junior. Would you mind
stepping outside for a moment?.

70
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,836
I need to speak to your father.

71
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,913
It's all right, Junior. It won't be long.

72
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:07,837
And, Junior, don't get into trouble.

73
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,672
- Dad!
- OK.

74
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:22,951
So what do you think?.
Is there anything wrong with Junior?.

75
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:26,476
- Absolutely nothing.
- Nothing?.

76
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:31,111
He is perfectly normal.
And just as sweet as a cinnamon bun.

77
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,350
That's right.

78
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:37,035
And you are doing a wonderful job, Mr Healy.

79
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:40,192
I just think that Junior's biggest obstacle

80
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:43,432
is that he feels like an outsider.

81
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,717
He needs to feel like an insider.

82
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:49,269
Get him involved in some activities
with his peers.

83
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,237
Peers?. What are peers?.

84
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:58,189
I don't know if that would be such a great idea.
You see, Junior's a little bit... high-spirited.

85
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:00,990
Exactly. And that's why

86
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:06,951
we need to channel
that energy into positive activities.

87
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,792
- Sports.
- Sports?.

88
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,155
- Scouting.
- Scouting?.

89
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:15,518
- Or cotillion?.
- Cotillion!

90
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:18,877
- As in dancing with girls cotillion?.
- Exactly.

91
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:25,830
Why don't you just kill me?.
I ain't going. No way!

92
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,513
Let me go!

93
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:31,593
Believe me, Junior. One of these days,
you're gonna thank me for this.

94
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:38,033
Nice, huh?.

95
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,271
Junior!

96
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:55,794
Stop! I'm not gonna go!

97
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,274
Don't!

98
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:14,159
Hold it!

99
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:17,232
I've told you once, I'll tell you a million times.

100
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,231
I ain't dancing with no skirts.

101
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,912
And that's final.

102
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,360
Fine. Fine. You win.

103
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:32,198
Even though you need to be with other kids
and feel more comfortable with yourself,

104
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:34,078
I can't force you, Junior.

105
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,071
I mean, you're getting older now.

106
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:39,232
It's time you started
to make your own decisions.

107
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:44,474
After all, what I think is right
might not necessarily be right for you.

108
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:48,474
Son, you're free to do what you want.

109
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:51,473
- Really?.
- No!

110
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,114
Put this on. You're going dancing.

111
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,509
No! Child abuse!

112
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:59,797
Stop! No, help, child abuse!

113
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:03,430
Somebody do something!

114
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,877
That's better.

115
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:10,919
Wow, look at this place.

116
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,399
This is great.

117
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,991
This is hell.

118
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:18,878
Hello.

119
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,553
[he screams]

120
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,517
Junior.

121
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:27,276
- I couldn't help it.
- Junior, this is Lila Duvane.

122
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:30,318
This is your teacher.
She's a world-famous foxtrotter.

123
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,596
Since when?. The Civil War?.

124
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:39,790
Welcome to
the Lila Duvane Academy of Dance.

125
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:47,831
What a darling little boy.

126
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:55,069
You can drag me in here
but you cannot make me dance.

127
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:58,710
No way, no how, no...

128
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,876
Wow.

129
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,634
[Junior] What a dame.

130
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:11,759
She's the most beautiful girl in the world.

131
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,831
And I don't even want to torment her.

132
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,791
Junior.

133
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,552
Junior, are you OK?.

134
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,438
Yeah, yeah, great, Dad.

135
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:24,991
Now, can you cheese off?.
You're cramping my style.

136
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:32,670
I take a few adult pupils

137
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:36,674
for private lessons.

138
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:44,998
Want some punch?.

139
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,955
Absolutely not.

140
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:54,996
- Murph, who's that girl?.
- Tiffany.

141
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,873
She just moved here. Why?.

142
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:04,157
- Do you like her?.
- Me and a broad?.

143
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:09,269
Get serious. She just seems,
I don't know, lonely.

144
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:13,272
Yeah, right. Stand in line.

145
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:19,151
See?. That's that scout guy, Duke. He's got
so many badges I can't even count 'em.

146
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:21,754
And there's the captain
of the hockey team, Blade.

147
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:24,275
And there's that actor guy, Corky McCullum.

148
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:27,193
He's so famous he's got his own cereal box.

149
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:30,670
Big deal. What have they got that I ain't got?.

150
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:36,472
A prayer. Look, you're out of your league.

151
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:41,709
Why don't you talk to my sister Bertha?.

152
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,116
She thinks you're hot.

153
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:49,478
Who let her out of Jurassic Park?.

154
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:54,314
- Did you just insult my sister?.
- No. I insulted T-Rex.

155
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,710
- Where are you going?.
- To meet Tiffany.

156
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:00,031
You?. You don't stand a snowball's chance
in a microwave.

157
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:05,028
Sure I do. All I got to do is talk to her.

158
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:11,759
What's going on?. My heart's pounding.

159
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:16,198
My palms are sweating. And I'm thinking
thoughts I never thought before.

160
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:33,876
Junior and Tiffany. Tiffany and Junior.

161
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:37,155
Sure, it sounds crazy,

162
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:40,039
but somehow it all makes sense.

163
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,510
Here goes nothing.

164
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:48,395
Stand back, boys,
and watch a master at work.

165
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:53,275
- Hi.
- Say hello.

166
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:56,398
- I'm Tiffany.
- Tell her your name.

167
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:03,952
Talk to her. Say anything.

168
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,635
I saw a dead cat yesterday.

169
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:11,270
- Get lost, Healy.
- Yeah, beat it, troll.

170
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,915
Nice tie.

171
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:23,910
Children. Children.

172
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:26,674
Listen up, children.

173
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:32,271
Now, everyone choose a partner.
And choose wisely.

174
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:37,434
Because just around the corner
is our annual costume ball.

175
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:42,037
Where two lucky children will be chosen

176
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:45,397
King and Queen!

177
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:50,076
[gentle rhythm foxtrot music]

178
00:13:57,280 --> 00:14:01,671
- Tiffany, may I have this dance?.
- My pleasure.

179
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:06,709
- Hello.
- Oh, no.

180
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:10,834
Oh, yes.

181
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,436
Hey, what's the big idea?.
Put me down right now.

182
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,591
[Junior screams]

183
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,550
Tiffany!

184
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:30,472
[Junior] Duke. He thinks he's so cool.

185
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:32,949
I know just how to heat him up.

186
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,509
[screams]

187
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:40,229
And Blade, he's flying a little too high.

188
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:43,039
Somebody's gonna have to shoot him down.

189
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:45,919
[man] Ready, aim, fire!.

190
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:50,789
[Junior] And Corky McCullum,
he's got a pretty big head.

191
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:53,599
Maybe I should take a little off the top.

192
00:14:56,120 --> 00:15:02,639
They will pay. Oh, yes, they will pay.

193
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:10,554
I am M r Burtis,

194
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:13,837
and unlike some of the teachers you've had...

195
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:19,952
.. I've got rules, lots and lots of rules.

196
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:23,237
Rules that will be followed at all times.

197
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:27,359
Rules that cannot and will not be broken.

198
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:32,959
You.

199
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,878
Little boy, what are you gawking at?.

200
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:42,395
The bell.

201
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:45,074
- Why?.
- [ringing]

202
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:47,629
You'll see.

203
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,791
[pupils] Uh-oh.

204
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:00,034
Thanks, I learned a lot!

205
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:04,959
[groans]

206
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:10,392
[child screaming nearby]

207
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:25,072
[screaming continues]

208
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,549
Bye-bye, Billy. And, remember,

209
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:43,794
brush three times a day
or this deadly fungus will grow in your mouth,

210
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:49,193
cover up your entire head
and make your skull cave in.

211
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,271
Next up, Junior Healy.

212
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,078
Oh, no, you don't!

213
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,673
- No, no, let me out!
- Gotcha!

214
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:05,154
That's got to hurt.

215
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:07,470
- Is it a cavity?.
- Is it a cavity?.

216
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:12,191
Is it a cavity?. Mister,
your son's mouth is a disaster area.

217
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:14,920
What have you been eating,
kid, hand grenades?.

218
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:16,639
[muffled]

219
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:20,793
Speak up, cotton-mouth, I can't hear you.

220
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:25,518
A little dentist humour.

221
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:27,796
Nurse Kiki, the X-ray.

222
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:29,029
Yes, Doctor.

223
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,630
Oh, Ben... Can I call you Ben?.

224
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:36,236
Well, I just did so I guess it's a little late.

225
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:39,676
Ben, did anyone ever tell you
you have excellent teeth?.

226
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:44,630
How would you like some free dental floss?.
Here, keep that for yourself.

227
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,793
Isn't it heinous?.

228
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:55,149
Your child has a rare condition
known as Appaloosa gingivitis nervosa.

229
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:57,754
Now, what this means
in simple layman's terms

230
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:02,516
is that his incisors are in
a life-and-death struggle with his bicuspids.

231
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:06,992
And his canines are horrified,
paralysed with fear,

232
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:10,914
staring incredulously at his molars.

233
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:17,553
- I don't even want to talk about his molars.
- That's a horse's mouth, you quack!

234
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:20,109
Nurse Kiki, more cotton!

235
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:26,919
- Bad boy!
- He's obviously delirious from the pain.

236
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:31,471
You poor boy.
What you must be going through.

237
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:34,712
The guilt. The shame.

238
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,314
Luckily, there's a cure.

239
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:41,916
A nose job?.

240
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:45,197
Oh, I'm sorry. I moonlight a little on the side.

241
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:47,912
Your kid needs braces.

242
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:53,278
- Braces?. Oh, no, you don't!
- Cotton!

243
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,949
Look, kid, braces aren't so bad.

244
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:04,194
All you need them for is a year, two years.
All right, ten, twenty years, the most.

245
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:06,396
Everybody's had 'em. I mean, look.

246
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:10,394
Stallone, Schwarzenegger,
the entire cast of Melrose Place.

247
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:13,552
Heather Locklear,
she used to have teeth out to here.

248
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:16,837
She was a walking can opener.

249
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,992
She could eat apples through a picket fence.

250
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:24,472
Now look at her.
She's got a smile almost as sexy as mine.

251
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:28,950
How soon does he need 'em?.

252
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:31,953
How soon can you pay?.

253
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:34,031
I don't know.

254
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:38,910
I don't mean to sound cheap,
but how much are they?.

255
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:48,911
[Junior] Braces, a one-way ticket to Geekville.

256
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:55,631
But as bad as it looked for me, my dad
had to do something even more humiliating.

257
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:57,597
Ask his old man for a loan.

258
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,639
[doorbell]

259
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,390
[Big Ben] It's open.

260
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:14,356
- What are you doing here?.
- I just came by to say hi.

261
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:17,076
- Hi.
- Dad, what are you doing?.

262
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:20,676
- Boxing's a great way to stay in shape.
- Yeah, but with Conchita?.

263
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:22,990
Your best fighters are Latinos.

264
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:25,196
You got Chavez, Duran...

265
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:31,671
- Come on, you flabby old goat, give it to me.
- That's the way I like 'em. Feisty.

266
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:34,479
- Where's the little demon?.
- He's at school.

267
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:37,074
And, Dad, he's not a demon. Junior loves you.

268
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:40,232
Yeah. He'd love to see me pushing up daisies.

269
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:44,116
Be a man. Be a man.

270
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:48,193
Speaking of Junior,
we had a little bit of a crisis today.

271
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:50,555
What happened?.
Somebody finally drain the lake?.

272
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:55,596
We went to the dentist
and found out he needs braces.

273
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:59,958
No, no. That's a complete waste of dough.
Have 'em yank all his teeth out.

274
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:06,195
Braces are expensive, and I was wondering
if maybe I could borrow some money.

275
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:09,397
- How much?.
- $5,000.

276
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:11,437
Sure. No problem.

277
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,795
- Come on.
- Really?.

278
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:16,679
Yeah. All you got to do is knock me out.

279
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:20,037
- What?.
- You heard me. Give him the gloves.

280
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:22,270
Dad, I don't want to fight you.

281
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:25,477
- What's the matter?. Afraid you'll lose?.
- No.

282
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:28,518
Take a sock at me. You know you want to.

283
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:30,557
- No, I don't.
- Sure you do.

284
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:33,678
- Do it.
- But you won't. I'll tell you why.

285
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:37,594
Because you're a failure, you got no guts.
That's why your wife dumped you.

286
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:41,753
That's why you can't get a girlfriend.
That's why other people push you around.

287
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:45,390
That's why you got that rotten kid.
A rotten kid with rotten teeth.

288
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:49,314
- He is not rotten. You take that back.
- Make me.

289
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:57,670
Remember, right, block, jab. Right, block, jab.

290
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:00,593
He has no left. Go for the gut.

291
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:06,235
All right. 5,000 smackers, right here.

292
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:10,632
- Will you take back all you said about Junior?.
- No way, loser.

293
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:14,713
And that's all you are.
A tiny little cry-baby loser.

294
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:20,753
You hit your own father, huh?.

295
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:24,754
Dad, I'm so sorry.
I don't know what got into me.

296
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:27,388
- That's all right, Little Ben.
- No hard feelings?.

297
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:30,199
No, none whatsoever.

298
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:36,556
Ay, caramba!

299
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:45,638
There she is. And she's alone.

300
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:50,920
Ah, Tiffany, little do you know
the happiness that awaits you.

301
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:56,837
Do you, Junior, being of sound mind
and incredible intelligence, grace and charm,

302
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,468
take Tiffany to be your lawfully wedded wife,

303
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:04,395
to have and to hold, and make every day
as wonderful as the last day of school?.

304
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:07,154
And how!

305
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:11,393
And do you, Tiffany,
promise to devote your entire life to Junior?.

306
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:14,199
Will you agree
to a reasonable pre-nuptial agreement,

307
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:16,157
to never gain too much weight,

308
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:19,790
bug him about staying up late to watch TV,
brushing his teeth,

309
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:23,714
or changing his underwear
for the rest of your natural days?.

310
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:26,199
Anything.

311
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:32,913
Ever since the first day I laid eyes on you,
I knew I had to be yours and yours alone.

312
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:35,548
And so it shall be, mi amor.

313
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:39,989
Then, by the power vested in me
by the Dream Sequence Board of Review,

314
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:45,075
I pronounce this striking young couple
man and wife.

315
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:49,199
- You may kiss the bride.
- At last!

316
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:57,950
This time, don't be nervous.
Grab the bull by the horns.

317
00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:01,078
Profess your undying love to her.

318
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:05,120
- Hi.
- Spit it out, you dope.

319
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:11,598
Last summer, my big toenail
turned black and fell off.

320
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:16,634
- Hey, Healy.
- Hey, Dork.

321
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:19,951
It's Duke, not Dork. Duke!

322
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:22,190
Duke.

323
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:27,070
Come on, pal. I'd thrash you right now,
but Tiffany's here.

324
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:29,754
Prairie Dog Scouts don't fight in front of ladies.

325
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:32,480
You wouldn't know that
because you're not a Scout.

326
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:35,518
A geek like you wouldn't last a second.

327
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:38,112
Come on, Tiff.

328
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:40,475
See that badge. It's for canoe racing.

329
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:43,791
- Me and my dad just set the new record.
- Really?. Wow!

330
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:49,478
This guy Duke is a tough nut,
but I know just how to crack it.

331
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:52,630
[guitar riff from Bad to the Bone]

332
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:57,588
[Junior] Come on, Dad, only one more mile.

333
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:59,352
Floor it.

334
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:02,751
Boy, I haven't seen you so excited
about anything that wasn't flammable.

335
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:06,595
Are you kidding, Dad?.
Prairie Dogs are the best.

336
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:12,710
Did you know that 31%  of all good deeds
are performed by Prairie Dog Scouts?.

337
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,996
Is that so?.

338
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:20,518
And look here. Famous Prairie Dog Scouts
have included President Herbert Hoover,

339
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:22,477
General George Patton

340
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:25,154
and rock musician Frank Zappa.

341
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:28,118
Wow. You're really gung-ho
about this Prairie Dog stuff.

342
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:33,149
Who wouldn't be?. Where else could you learn
how to feed, clothe and house a family of four

343
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:35,550
using only an eight-foot birch tree?.

344
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:39,956
I'm thrilled to see
you're so excited about something.

345
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:43,078
You wouldn't have any particular reason
for joining Scouts, would you?.

346
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:46,839
- What do you mean?.
- Reasons, like...

347
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,389
Well, remember when you joined
that archery class?.

348
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:53,951
Dad, all I'm doing is going out in the woods
and playing with other kids

349
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:56,315
under adult supervision.

350
00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:01,270
- Would you rather I joined a gang?.
- No, scouting is just fine.

351
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:05,911
- Hey, Dad, they got archery here too.
- Oh, boy.

352
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:08,992
[leader] Left, right, left! Left! Left!

353
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:12,152
[leader and scouts shout out drill]

354
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:19,592
- And halt!
- [shrill whistle]

355
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:22,794
Prairie Dogs, line up.

356
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:26,032
- On the double.
- Scoutmaster Flimm.

357
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:31,998
Hi. We spoke on the phone.

358
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:35,994
I'm Ben Healy. This is my son Junior.

359
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:40,631
Welcome aboard, grunt.
Mister, today you're dropping off a boy.

360
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:43,473
But believe me,
you're gonna be picking up a man.

361
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:45,517
Well, that's great.

362
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:50,554
Scoutmaster Flimm,
I have a little suggestion for you.

363
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:52,711
Junior doesn't always respond well to authority

364
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:56,873
so you might want
to take it easy on him for a while.

365
00:26:57,040 --> 00:27:00,999
- Is that so?.
- You have no idea.

366
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:05,392
Well, gosh, Ben, thanks. I'll keep that in mind.

367
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:11,515
Nice meeting you.

368
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:13,591
Bye, Dad.

369
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:15,990
Have a nice day.

370
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:20,234
Get in line, Healy, now!

371
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:23,358
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

372
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:26,552
- Cut it out!
- Watch it!

373
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:28,756
Attention!

374
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:34,639
Prairie Dog Healy, I said attention.

375
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:38,429
That means snap to, on the double!
Understand?.

376
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:40,238
Yeah.

377
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:43,153
No, no, you don't say yeah.

378
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:46,790
You say, "Yes, sir, Scoutmaster Flimm!"
Let's hear it.

379
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:48,791
Yes, sir, Scoutmaster Phlegm!

380
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,560
It's Flimm, not Phlegm.

381
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:57,359
Flimm!

382
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:59,590
Sorry.

383
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:04,558
Prairie Dog Duke,
give me the Prairie Dog motto.

384
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:10,113
Yes, sir, Scoutmaster Dad. "Prairie Dogs
never cry. Prairie Dogs never say die."

385
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:15,035
"Prairie Dogs do not rest.
Prairie Dogs are the best."

386
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:18,192
[all bark and howl like a prairie dog]

387
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:24,478
What is this?. A kennel?.

388
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:27,200
Kennel?.

389
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:31,751
OK, it's time for today's lesson. Fire-starting.

390
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:37,392
Healy, you get the firewood. Get going.
Duke, go with him. Make sure he does it right.

391
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:38,913
Move it, scrub.

392
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:46,555
- So, Dork...
- It's Duke. The name's Duke.

393
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:50,918
Whatever. Anyway, do you like Tiffany?.

394
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:54,356
- What do you care, twerp?.
- Just asking.

395
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:56,954
She's all right.

396
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:58,758
Does she like you?.

397
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:00,558
Of course, why wouldn't she?.

398
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:03,553
'Cause you're an idiotic,
zit-licking, moronic boob.

399
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:06,518
- What?.
- I said there's a stick by your boot.

400
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:16,997
- You don't like Tiffany, do you?.
- Me?. A dame?. Get real.

401
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:21,278
Good. 'Cause she'd never go out
with a twerp like you in a million years.

402
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:23,476
You and Tiffany!

403
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:27,316
Ow!

404
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:31,268
- Where are you going?.
- Nature's calling. Be right back.

405
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:43,757
Perfect.

406
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:53,316
Be prepared.

407
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:00,191
[whine of chainsaw]

408
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:03,389
Hey, where's Healy?.

409
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:06,233
- He's taking a leak.
- What a wimp.

410
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:08,755
Real men hold it in.

411
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:12,440
What's that sound?.

412
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:14,753
Sounds like a chainsaw.

413
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:24,154
- Back to camp, soldier.
- Sir, yes, sir.

414
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:29,357
I'll supervise young Master Healy personally.

415
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:31,511
Healy!

416
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:36,509
Healy!

417
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:39,558
Where'd that little pipsqueak...?. Ooh!

418
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:45,276
An arrowhead.

419
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:52,916
- Today's my lucky day.
- Timber!

420
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:57,712
Oh, Mama!

421
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:02,710
[prairie dog howl]

422
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:05,519
Prairie Dogs never say die!

423
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:10,151
[school bell]

424
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:18,633
OK, so far I was having
a little trouble meeting Tiffany.

425
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:23,669
But there's nothing that turns
a woman 's heart to butter like a good deed.

426
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:28,758
Here's your notebook, Tiffany.
You must've dropped it.

427
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:33,277
No need to thank me,
I'm a Prairie Dog Scout, it's my duty!

428
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:36,158
Loser.

429
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:42,317
- Blade, hi.
- What's up, Tiff?.

430
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:45,320
- Your hair looks nice today.
- So does yours.

431
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:47,550
- I know.
- [guitar riff from Bad to the Bone]

432
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:52,669
Of course, you realise, Blade,
that you have just entered your own Vietnam.

433
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:54,796
A war you cannot win.

434
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:07,993
Hey, Dad!
I think I've finally found a sport I like.

435
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:18,679
Are you sure you want to do this?.
These guys look pretty advanced.

436
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:21,149
Especially that one right there.

437
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:24,517
Blade?. He stinks.

438
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:26,272
I don't know.

439
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:29,637
Don't worry, Dad.
I can skate rings around these guys.

440
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:35,713
Hey, fellas, mind if I join you?.

441
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:39,270
- Get out of here.
- No way, loser.

442
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:43,752
Wait a second, guys.
Sure, Healy, you can play.

443
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:46,593
Come on, guys, we'll have some fun.

444
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:48,716
Oh, OK.

445
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:52,234
- Gee, thanks.
- I like the top.

446
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:55,756
- Junior, be careful.
- I will.

447
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:59,276
Don't worry, sir. We'll take good care of him.

448
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:13,510
- Goodnight, Healy.
- Junior, look out!

449
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:20,430
Junior, wake up.

450
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:28,831
- How many fingers do you see?.
- Just one, Mr Lincoln.

451
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:34,229
- Mr Lincoln?.
- Yeah. Aren't you Abraham Lincoln?.

452
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:36,197
The man who freed the slaves?.

453
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:41,992
No, Junior, I'm Ben Healy. I'm your father.

454
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:46,950
Jeez, Dad, get a clue. I was only kidding.

455
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:51,432
You had me worried. You took quite a hit.
There's a lesson to be learned here.

456
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:56,672
There once was a man
by the name of Knute Rockne

457
00:33:56,840 --> 00:34:00,799
who started coaching football
at a little school called Notre Dame.

458
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:05,351
Now, everyone thought his good-for-nothing
team would never amount to anything.

459
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:11,277
But who had the last laugh?.
Knute Rockne, that's who.

460
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:16,036
See, old Knute, he had something
that no one counted on.

461
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:20,398
And that was stamina, enthusiasm, drive.

462
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:23,552
He even put all his players
in silk jerseys, so that...

463
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:28,555
Cut to the chase, Dad. What's the point?.

464
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:31,553
The point is, Junior, you can't quit.

465
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:35,838
Quit?. Who said anything about quitting?.

466
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:42,553
I ain't no quitter. And that goes for hockey and
Scouts and even that stupid dancing stuff.

467
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:45,518
I'll be there till no one else is left standing.

468
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:48,148
I am so proud of you.

469
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:51,073
Thanks, Dad.

470
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:54,516
Puke! What is this, a Greek freighter?.

471
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:56,511
What's he doing here?.

472
00:34:56,680 --> 00:35:00,958
Dad gave me the nightshift to help pay
for your braces. He's gonna be babysitting.

473
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:04,317
- Why?. What's in it for him?.
- Oh, nothing.

474
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:11,192
Do I have to have a reason to spend a little
quality time with my only grandson, huh?.

475
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:18,191
He's a rascal, isn't he, eh?.

476
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:21,232
[phone pips]

477
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:25,519
Overseas operator?.

478
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:31,118
I want to make a person-to-person call
to the Philippines.

479
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:35,034
- Manila.
- Quality time, my butt!

480
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:38,033
Ah, now, shut up up there.

481
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:40,873
Leilani?. Hello.

482
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:47,797
Yeah, I saw your picture.
Boy, you sure are a good-looker.

483
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:53,150
Ben!

484
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:56,710
- Sarah! Hi.
- Hi.

485
00:35:56,880 --> 00:36:00,759
- I didn't know you worked here.
- Work here?. I own the place.

486
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:05,516
Well, actually, my father does.

487
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:10,998
So, can I help you?.

488
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:14,869
Actually, yes.

489
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:18,237
- I'm thinking of buying an exercise machine.
- Good for you.

490
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:21,551
It's good to be healthy. Not that you're not.

491
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:25,030
I mean, you're very firm and supple.

492
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:28,951
Healthy. Firm and healthy.

493
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:32,510
Anyway...do you know what you're looking for?.

494
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:38,596
Well, I'm having a little trouble deciding.
But I think a treadmill.

495
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:41,558
Good choice. Very aerobic.

496
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:43,517
- Try one out.
- Oh, can l?.

497
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:46,035
Absolutely. Let's just turn it on.

498
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:48,350
- OK.
- And...

499
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:52,720
So how's Junior?.

500
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:58,000
Well, actually, great.
I've been meaning to thank you.

501
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:01,709
Ever since we came and saw you,
his whole attitude has changed.

502
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:05,953
We're doing the activities that you suggested,
and he loves them.

503
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:08,554
He can't wait to go back to cotillion.

504
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:13,032
And he jumped at the chance to join Scouts.

505
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:18,320
And he's even playing... roller hockey.

506
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:26,391
- That's great.
- So... have you decided?.

507
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:28,994
Gee...

508

OK, Helga. Now, you be sure and say hello
to everybody in Düsseldorf for me.

- Where's the good hooch?.
- I don't know.

514

Yes, you do. Now, don't you lie to me, boy,

515
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:04,512
or I'll tell your daddy
what happened to old lady Figler.

- No.

So long, chump.

What are you doing out there, you little devil?.
Let me out of here.

525
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:47,391
- I hope I didn't take up too much of your time.
- Not at all.

Not that they don't already.

- I'm sure they smell fine.
- Thanks. And thanks again for all your help.

531
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:15,752
I wonder, if it's not a breach
in professional ethics,

532
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:19,151
do you think sometime
you might want to go out to dinner?.

533
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:24,030
Gee, Ben, that's really sweet of you to ask,

534
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:26,270
but I just broke up with this guy

535
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:30,513
and it's a little soon for me to be dating again,
you know?.

536
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:35,677
- Unfortunately, I do.
- Thanks for asking.

537
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:38,479
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

538

- Phlegm.
- Flimm.

539

- That's my woman.
- Sarah?. But...

540
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:03,429
You leave her alone, you hear me?.

541
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:07,195
Now, hold on.
If you'd like to discuss this like an adult...

Thank you for bringing that to my attention.

Hey, Dad, how was work?.

547
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:32,589
A little rough.

548
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:35,320
- Where's Big Ben?.
- I think he went home.

549

Come on, Junior, I'll tuck you into bed.

- Comfy?.
- Junior, are you...?.

557
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:23,874
Mr Healy, this is the best decision
you've ever made.

558
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:28,079
A clean mouth is a happy mouth,
and no one likes rotten teeth.

559
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:30,879
Unless, of course, the British.
I hate the British.

560
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:35,272
They have teeth like wolverines.
They're heinous.

Listen up, children.
I have a very special announcement.

the Mortville Elementary School play.

573
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:41,836
We will be doing
an original version of Peter Pan.

in history. But I'm still a normal kid.

And that's why I start out every day with a big
hearty bowl of delicious Krazy Krunch cereal.

584

And why is it so delicious?.

585
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:57,989
'Cause it has twice the sugar
of the other leading brands combined.

- Yeah.
- OK.

- Gee, I don't know.

- Well, let's find it.

- Dad, Dad, can I ask you something?.
- Sure.

594
00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:29,359
Well, lately I've kind of
been thinking about girls.

595
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:33,115
- Really?.
- And something sort of confuses me.

And she turns tadpoles into frogs.

or embarrassed about.

[Rupert] Tally-ho, sir. Very good.

678
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:46,994
Excellent, sir.

679
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:56,678
Excellent.

680
00:50:57,240 --> 00:50:59,276
Stimulating.

681
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:02,079
Oh, Olympic quality, sir.

682
00:51:06,360 --> 00:51:09,716
Wow, Corky, I never knew
you were such a good horseback rider.

683
00:51:09,880 --> 00:51:11,871
My love affair with the equine began

684
00:51:12,040 --> 00:51:18,115
with the extensive training I underwent
for the critically acclaimed Guppy Goes West.

685
00:51:18,280 --> 00:51:23,877
It's an expensive habit, but then again
most of the things really worth doing are.

686
00:51:24,040 --> 00:51:26,429
Rupert, raise the fences.

687
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:30,275
Your slightest whim is my command, sir.

688
00:51:33,640 --> 00:51:35,756
Watch and marvel.

689
00:51:43,480 --> 00:51:46,677
Hi-ho, Silver!

690
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:54,277
Bull's-eye.

691
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:57,709
Rupert, I'm wet.

692
00:52:03,800 --> 00:52:09,158
Well, well, well, welcome.
And what are we doing today?.

693
00:52:09,320 --> 00:52:13,279
Let's see. Uh-oh, spleen removal.

694
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:16,398
That's Mrs Galecki,
that's my two o'clock appointment.

695
00:52:16,560 --> 00:52:18,755
Oh, sorry. Junior Healy.

696
00:52:21,160 --> 00:52:23,993
You're here to have your braces tightened.

697
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:28,237
Don't worry. This won't hurt a bit.

698
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:32,439
Unless, of course, the gas wears off.
In that case, it's a doozy.

699
00:52:32,600 --> 00:52:38,436
I've seen big burly Marines
break down and cry like little babies.

700
00:52:38,600 --> 00:52:40,431
Some of them even fainted.

701
00:52:40,600 --> 00:52:43,160
[muffled protests]

702
00:52:43,320 --> 00:52:46,392
Look, how many times
do I have to tell you?. Enunciate.

703
00:52:46,560 --> 00:52:49,199
Doc, your bookie's on the phone.

704
00:52:49,360 --> 00:52:51,476
Whoo! Ha-ha!

705
00:52:52,040 --> 00:52:54,315
Don't go anywhere.

706
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:57,351
Like you could.

707
00:52:57,520 --> 00:53:01,354
Oh, boy, my ship has come in.

708
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:20,151
[hissing gas]

709
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:24,475
Okey-doke, let's get back to work.

710
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:26,596
You and I are gonna be good friends.

711
00:53:26,760 --> 00:53:29,877
I'm gonna be dancing at your wedding.

712
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:33,191
And you'll still be wearing braces.

713
00:53:36,320 --> 00:53:37,912
[hysterical laughter]

714
00:53:40,280 --> 00:53:41,679
I... I feel...

715
00:53:43,600 --> 00:53:46,990
I feel light-headed.

716
00:53:47,640 --> 00:53:49,949
Oh, oh, look!

717
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:53,473
The gas.

718
00:53:55,360 --> 00:53:59,319
Nurse Kiki, remove my trousers.

719
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:08,512
- Done so soon?.
- Yeah. Couldn't have gone better.

720
00:54:08,680 --> 00:54:10,591
OK.

721
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:20,710
[she screams and he groans]

722
00:54:25,600 --> 00:54:31,197
Damn you, Junior Healy!

723
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:35,390
Look at me, Ben Healy,
I've been doing this for 70 years.

724
00:54:35,560 --> 00:54:38,916
That's it, girls, get those legs up and down.

725
00:54:39,080 --> 00:54:40,752
Shake those tushies all around.

726
00:54:40,920 --> 00:54:42,956
Come on, girls.

727
00:54:43,120 --> 00:54:44,792
- Hey.
- Sarah.

728
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:46,279
Hi, Ben.

729
00:54:47,800 --> 00:54:49,791
Am I glad to see you.

730
00:54:49,960 --> 00:54:53,635
I wanted to get some more of those
deodorant balls. They're great.

731
00:54:53,800 --> 00:54:55,950
Sure. No problem.

732
00:54:56,520 --> 00:54:59,353
Is something wrong?.

733
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:05,311
No, well, it's just that
last time you were here,

734
00:55:05,480 --> 00:55:09,234
I had a bit of a run-in with your old boyfriend,
Scoutmaster Flimm.

735
00:55:09,400 --> 00:55:12,949
Eugene?. Oh, did he hit you?.

736
00:55:13,120 --> 00:55:16,999
No, he just picked me up and shook me.

737
00:55:17,160 --> 00:55:20,869
Oh, Ben, I am so sorry.

738
00:55:21,040 --> 00:55:25,238
Eugene has a problem with jealousy.
It comes from poor self-esteem.

739
00:55:25,400 --> 00:55:28,631
In kindergarten, another child
had a deluxe box of crayons,

740
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:30,631
while he only had burnt umber.

741
00:55:30,800 --> 00:55:32,836
He's been obsessing about it ever since.

742
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:36,470
I think it's time he got over it.
It's been a few years.

743
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:38,676
I know.

744
00:55:38,840 --> 00:55:43,960
We tried and tried
until, finally, his insurance ran out.

745
00:55:44,120 --> 00:55:46,918
I just don't see the two of you together.

746
00:55:47,080 --> 00:55:49,640
We had a stormy relationship.

747
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:55,432
I broke it off. And ever since then,
he's sort of been stalking me.

748
00:55:56,640 --> 00:56:02,476
But this time he has gone too far. I'm gonna
call him up and give him a piece of my...

749
00:56:02,640 --> 00:56:06,872
Forget it. I'm fine. I mean, I can handle it.

750
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:12,596
- You're a very brave man.
- Well, not really.

751
00:56:12,760 --> 00:56:15,149
But I am carrying pepper spray.

752
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:20,795
Oh, Ben, I've been thinking,

753
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:24,430
if you still want to get together sometime,
we could have coffee.

754
00:56:24,600 --> 00:56:31,153
I'd love to hear how Junior's doing
and, well, it would be fun being with you.

755
00:56:32,600 --> 00:56:34,431
- Really?.
- Yeah.

756
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:40,950
Great. Well, Junior's in a school play
a week from Friday.

757
00:56:41,120 --> 00:56:44,476
- Would you like to go with me to that?.
- Sure.

758
00:56:44,640 --> 00:56:46,551
Great!

759
00:56:47,560 --> 00:56:51,758
Oh, gosh, I'm late for an appointment.
Whoops.

760
00:56:51,920 --> 00:56:53,672
I better get going.

761
00:56:53,840 --> 00:56:56,718
Do you want me to get you
those deodorant balls?.

762
00:56:56,880 --> 00:57:01,795
Oh, no, actually, I just came by to see you.

763
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:02,949
Goodbye.

764
00:57:06,440 --> 00:57:07,839
Yes.

765
00:57:10,360 --> 00:57:13,352
Ben Healy, you got the stuff.

766
00:57:15,880 --> 00:57:19,236
Why, Ben, what a surprise.

767
00:57:19,400 --> 00:57:22,073
- I'm warning you.
- No...

768
00:57:22,240 --> 00:57:25,391
.. I'm warning you. Leave her alone!

769
00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:43,152
[guitar riff from Bad to the Bone]

770
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:56,758
Nice move, spaz.

771
00:58:59,400 --> 00:59:01,914
Yeah!

772
00:59:08,720 --> 00:59:12,395
Hey, Blade, we're playing Healy's team today.

773
00:59:12,560 --> 00:59:16,109
Awesome. Where is the little doofus?.

774
00:59:28,600 --> 00:59:30,875
All right, face off.

775
00:59:31,040 --> 00:59:34,749
Hi, guys. I'm back.

776
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:40,391
Yeah. Come on, man. You get him, come on.

777
00:59:43,600 --> 00:59:46,876
- Good luck, Junior.
- Go, red, go!

778
00:59:47,040 --> 00:59:50,430
- Dad, Junior's on the blue team.
- I know.

779
00:59:50,600 --> 00:59:52,113
Kill 'em, red, kill 'em.

780
00:59:57,360 --> 00:59:59,430
Hope your dad has a good health plan.

781
00:59:59,600 --> 01:00:02,717
Hope your dad knows a good bone specialist.

782
01:00:03,680 --> 01:00:07,389
- I can't look.
- You sissy.

783
01:00:13,760 --> 01:00:15,796
I'm gonna crush you, you little sucker.

784
01:00:18,600 --> 01:00:20,750
Not so fast.

785
01:00:20,920 --> 01:00:22,956
Hey, hold it!

786
01:00:31,680 --> 01:00:33,511
Junior!

787
01:00:33,680 --> 01:00:35,636
This is a better game than I thought.

788
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:40,192
Help! Help!

789
01:00:42,840 --> 01:00:44,990
Junior, don't test me.

790
01:00:47,760 --> 01:00:50,991
- You're out of here, son.
- Who died and made you king?.

791
01:00:54,720 --> 01:00:56,358
Blade.

792
01:00:58,080 --> 01:00:59,752
Time out. Time out.

793
01:01:02,560 --> 01:01:05,677
[laughing]

794
01:01:06,760 --> 01:01:09,399
My mask is stuck.

795
01:01:09,560 --> 01:01:11,278
It won't come off.

796
01:01:13,600 --> 01:01:14,874
Mommy!

797
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:18,956
Yeah!

798
01:01:20,520 --> 01:01:22,511
[siren]

799
01:01:25,160 --> 01:01:27,151
[booing]

800
01:01:30,480 --> 01:01:32,357
You're next, showboy.

801
01:01:44,320 --> 01:01:49,952
[rock music on and off]

802
01:01:54,480 --> 01:01:59,235
- We're not gonna start this again, are we?.
- How do you expect me to react?.

803
01:01:59,400 --> 01:02:01,072
Am I supposed to be proud?.

804
01:02:01,240 --> 01:02:04,915
Two minutes into your first roller hockey game
and you've been banned for life.

805
01:02:05,080 --> 01:02:07,310
You always tell me to give it my all.

806
01:02:07,480 --> 01:02:11,473
I'm starting to see a pattern emerging
and I'm not happy about it.

807
01:02:11,640 --> 01:02:13,915
Hey, Dad, hockey's a dangerous sport.

808
01:02:14,080 --> 01:02:17,550
I'm not talking about hockey.
I'm talking about the way you treat people.

809
01:02:17,720 --> 01:02:23,317
I didn't do nothing to Blade and those guys
that they wouldn't have done to me.

810
01:02:23,480 --> 01:02:26,199
Except they wouldn't have done it
with as much style.

811
01:02:27,040 --> 01:02:31,033
Junior, we are a society of rules, OK?.

812
01:02:31,200 --> 01:02:33,919
What if everyone went around
doing whatever they wanted,

813
01:02:34,080 --> 01:02:36,594
without any concern
for what their actions would result in?.

814
01:02:36,760 --> 01:02:38,273
Yeah, Dad, I know.

815
01:02:38,440 --> 01:02:42,433
The judge gave me that whole speech
when he issued that restraining order.

816
01:02:42,600 --> 01:02:48,357
How do you think I feel when people see us
and they cross to the other side of the street?.

817
01:02:48,520 --> 01:02:51,478
- Powerful?.
- No. Humiliated.

818
01:02:52,760 --> 01:02:55,194
From now on, things are gonna be different.

819
01:02:56,280 --> 01:03:00,637
We're gonna have a code of conduct,
and this time you're gonna abide by it.

820
01:03:01,640 --> 01:03:03,596
- What are you doing?.
- I'm getting out.

821
01:03:03,760 --> 01:03:08,151
- You can't just leap out of a moving car.
- It's better than listening to this lecture.

822
01:03:12,720 --> 01:03:16,838
I wish that my dad was as hard on me
as I am on you.

823
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:20,117
At least it would've shown me
that he cared about me.

824
01:03:21,400 --> 01:03:26,269
Junior, your grandpa and I don't have
the greatest relationship in the world.

825
01:03:26,440 --> 01:03:27,873
Duh!

826
01:03:28,040 --> 01:03:32,113
When I was growing up, anything seemed
like it was more important to him than me.

827
01:03:32,280 --> 01:03:38,594
And I vowed when I had a son of my own
I was gonna be the best father that I could be.

828
01:03:38,760 --> 01:03:43,550
I don't always hit my mark, but I sure try
because I want you to be a better man.

829
01:03:43,720 --> 01:03:47,395
Well, do you have to try so hard
on the yelling part?.

830
01:03:49,400 --> 01:03:52,710
I'm sorry, but when I see you
moving in the wrong direction,

831
01:03:52,880 --> 01:03:56,395
I'm gonna do whatever it takes
to get you back on track.

832
01:03:56,560 --> 01:03:58,835
You're right, Dad.

833
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:02,470
- Let's go get something to eat at Pizzariffic.
- All right!

834
01:04:28,640 --> 01:04:31,791
Ben, is that seat taken?.

835
01:04:31,960 --> 01:04:33,552
Oh, no, it's yours.

836
01:04:33,720 --> 01:04:37,269
I mean, I saved it for you.

837
01:04:39,920 --> 01:04:44,277
I hope you don't mind meeting me here.
I thought it would be safer.

838
01:04:44,440 --> 01:04:48,149
- It's OK.
- Scoutmaster Flimm didn't follow you, did he?.

839
01:04:48,320 --> 01:04:51,790
Oh, Ben, don't be ridiculous.

840
01:04:51,960 --> 01:04:53,837
I switched cars.

841
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,514
- Well, I don't need these, then, do l?.
- No.

842
01:04:58,840 --> 01:05:01,877
That's better. Oh, thank you.

843
01:05:04,560 --> 01:05:07,870
Do you think they'd mind if I took a snapshot?.

Good day, forest creatures,
what news do you bring?.

848
01:05:32,200 --> 01:05:35,556
There's a new boy in town, and he likes to fly.

849
01:05:35,720 --> 01:05:39,838
Soon he'll come down...
from the clouds up high.

850
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:43,310
But who is this magical boy?.

851
01:05:44,560 --> 01:05:49,350
He's a conceited little dweeb
whose parents are robbing him blind.

853

- I wonder where Junior's going.
- Maybe he has a costume change.

866
01:07:20,360 --> 01:07:23,909
Hurry, someone barfed in the girls' bathroom.

867
01:07:24,080 --> 01:07:27,516
Barfed?. Hold this, I'm on the way.

Corky! Corky!

874
01:08:10,560 --> 01:08:15,270
What the hell do you think you're doing,
you little weed?. Let go of that now.

875
01:08:15,440 --> 01:08:20,389
- I said now.
- OK, but don't say I didn't warn you.

01:08:47,680 --> 01:08:51,116
Are you sure you had
nothing to do with all that?.

880
01:08:51,280 --> 01:08:52,713
Who?. Me?.

881
01:08:52,880 --> 01:08:59,558
Well, I thought you did a terrific job.
You were the best weed I ever saw.

882
01:08:59,720 --> 01:09:03,315
- Thanks, lady.
- Junior, you don't have to call her lady.

883
01:09:03,480 --> 01:09:06,278
- Her name is Sarah.
- And your name is mud.

884
01:09:06,440 --> 01:09:09,398
- Eugene...!
- I told you to leave her alone.

885
01:09:09,560 --> 01:09:11,516
Sarah belongs to me.

886
01:09:11,680 --> 01:09:15,195
Yeah, and you stay away from Tiffany.
She's my girl.

887
01:09:15,360 --> 01:09:18,955
Eugene, you keep forgetting. We broke up.

888
01:09:19,120 --> 01:09:22,829
You'll take me back.
You need me. You love me.

889
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:24,592
I told you not...

890
01:09:25,760 --> 01:09:28,832
Now, let's settle this once and for all.

891
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:33,994
Duke and I are challenging you
and Junior to a test of manhood.

892
01:09:34,160 --> 01:09:36,515
A relay race at tomorrow's
Prairie Dog Scoutarama.

893

- The winners get the women.
- Now, see here.

894
01:09:40,720 --> 01:09:45,157
- I am not some prize to be won.
- Are you two man enough?.

895
01:09:45,320 --> 01:09:47,834
I need time to train for something like that.

896
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,116
I knew it.

897
01:09:50,680 --> 01:09:54,070
- You got no guts.
- He does too.

898
01:09:54,240 --> 01:09:58,119
He's not afraid of anything.
He's the greatest dad in the world.

899
01:10:00,160 --> 01:10:03,914
Thanks, Junior.
And you're the greatest son in the world.

900
01:10:04,080 --> 01:10:08,790
We'll take on you and your lousy race
and we'll beat your butts.

901
01:10:08,960 --> 01:10:12,635
- You're on.
- You're on.

902
01:10:14,080 --> 01:10:16,071
[shrill whistle]

903
01:10:20,160 --> 01:10:24,870
Can you blow that a little louder?.
I still can hear out of this ear.

904
01:10:25,040 --> 01:10:27,031
Quiet!

905
01:10:28,320 --> 01:10:32,598
Well, I hope you're ready
to look fear dead in the face

906
01:10:32,760 --> 01:10:36,673
and find out what kind of man you really are.

907
01:10:36,840 --> 01:10:40,879
First, there's the gunny sack race.

908
01:10:41,040 --> 01:10:43,679
Then the Prairie Dog obstacle course.

909
01:10:43,840 --> 01:10:48,595
And finally, if you make it that far,
the canoe race.

910
01:10:48,760 --> 01:10:50,751
May the better man win.

911
01:10:56,240 --> 01:10:58,231
You dated this guy?.

912
01:11:02,960 --> 01:11:05,633
- Good luck, Duke.
- This'll be a cinch.

913
01:11:05,800 --> 01:11:10,715
- Good luck, Junior.
- She talked to me. She knows my name.

914
01:11:10,880 --> 01:11:15,237
Quick, think of some snappy repartee.

915
01:11:15,400 --> 01:11:20,633
Once, when I sneezed,
a piece of corn came out of my nose.

916
01:11:22,280 --> 01:11:26,319
- Bad choice.
- Ben.

917
01:11:26,480 --> 01:11:28,198
You don't have to do this.

918
01:11:29,760 --> 01:11:32,228
I want to. Don't you see?.

919
01:11:33,400 --> 01:11:35,470
Sarah, I know it sounds corny,

920
01:11:35,640 --> 01:11:40,589
but there comes a time in every guy's life
when he's got to prove that he's a man.

921
01:11:40,760 --> 01:11:42,478
By running a sack race?.

922
01:11:42,640 --> 01:11:44,949
On your marks, get set, go!

Jump, jump, jump.

926
01:12:03,160 --> 01:12:05,993
- Sir, permission to speak, sir.
- Granted.

927
01:12:06,160 --> 01:12:09,516
- There's something stinky in this sack.
- It's just mud.

928
01:12:09,680 --> 01:12:13,389
It doesn't smell like mud. It smells like...

929
01:12:18,280 --> 01:12:22,159
- Did you do something to their sack?.
- No, but a cow did.

930

- Hi, Tiffany.
- Hi.

01:18:15,280 --> 01:18:17,430
You wouldn't dance with me, would you?.

1000
01:18:17,600 --> 01:18:20,910
Why, Junior Healy, I thought you'd never ask.

1001
01:18:30,520 --> 01:18:34,354
Ever since the first day I saw you,
I've always kinda liked you.

1002

- I think you're cute.
- Thanks.

1003
01:18:37,640 --> 01:18:39,835
- Do you think I'm cute?.
- Of course.

1004
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:44,312
- Am I the cutest girl in the room?.
- You're no dog, that's for sure.

1005

Does my hair shine
and bounce more than anyone else's?.

1006

- I don't know.
- I'm thirsty. Get me some punch.

Now!

1008

Everybody says I've got
a peaches and cream complexion

they would've picked you otherwise.

And when you wave to the crowd,
keep your hand cupped.

1017
01:19:34,720 --> 01:19:36,995
And only wave three times to each side.

1018
01:19:37,160 --> 01:19:42,678
And smile, but not too big.
Big smiles wrinkle your face.

1019
01:19:46,640 --> 01:19:48,551
[music stops]

1020
01:19:51,400 --> 01:19:53,118
Boys and girls.

1021
01:19:55,320 --> 01:19:58,630
On behalf of Lila Duvane,
who unfortunately cannot talk tonight

1022
01:19:58,800 --> 01:20:02,429
because she recently bit off
part of her tongue...

1023
01:20:02,600 --> 01:20:04,397
- Gross!
- Yeah.

1024
01:20:04,560 --> 01:20:07,916
I would like to announce the King
and Queen of the Costume Ball.

1025
01:20:09,240 --> 01:20:11,629
Tiffany and Junior!

1026
01:20:11,800 --> 01:20:13,791
[cheering]

1027
01:20:15,560 --> 01:20:18,154
I don't believe it!

1028
01:20:21,760 --> 01:20:25,275
- [gasps]
- [mocking laughter]

1029
01:20:33,280 --> 01:20:36,272
Hey, Tiffany, you forgot your dress!

1030
01:20:39,240 --> 01:20:40,593
Brute!

1031
01:20:40,760 --> 01:20:44,639
Girlfriend! Wait, girlfriend! I'll help you...

1032
01:20:45,720 --> 01:20:47,711
This is not my day.

1033
01:20:56,560 --> 01:20:59,358
Don't worry, pal. There's other fish in the sea.

1034
01:21:01,560 --> 01:21:05,235
- I'm sorry it didn't work out.
- That's all right, Dad.

1035
01:21:05,400 --> 01:21:10,793
Look at all the neat stuff I did. I joined Scouts,
I played hockey, I was in a play

1036
01:21:10,960 --> 01:21:14,555
and I got to see
that rotten wench's dress rip off.

1037
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:17,718
Yeah.

1038
01:21:17,880 --> 01:21:22,192
Anyway, you just remember,
I'm here if you need me.

1039
01:21:22,360 --> 01:21:26,353
- Thanks, Dad. You're the greatest.
- So are you, son.

1040
01:21:29,480 --> 01:21:31,311
May I have this dance?.

1041
01:22:00,040 --> 01:22:02,508
This is not my day.

1042
01:22:17,240 --> 01:22:20,391
- Hi.
- Hi.

1043
01:22:31,520 --> 01:22:35,433
[Junior] Well, there you have it.
Another happy ending.

1044
01:22:35,600 --> 01:22:37,716
I got a new girlfriend.

1045
01:22:39,120 --> 01:22:40,792
Dad got Sarah.

1046
01:22:40,960 --> 01:22:45,829
And Duke, Corky and Blade
learned that sometimes love hurts.

1047
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:48,389
Well, I guess that wraps things up.

1048
01:22:48,560 --> 01:22:52,269
So until next time, this is Junior Healy saying

1049
01:22:52,440 --> 01:22:55,318
so long, suckers!
