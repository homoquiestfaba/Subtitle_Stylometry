Stop you, man! Wait!

Wait! Stop!

3
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:39,471
We have to get out of here

00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,997
Dead man had tried to .....

20
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:01,437
And is the most ferocious warriors,
And I lived

21
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:05,911
Africans and others are afraid of the barbarians

22
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:09,635
Knowing that they call the name
"The lives of the jungle"

23
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:12,599
And believe that they can prepare
Many of the evil magic

24
00:07:56,520 --> 00:08:00,672
- Why are deceased us?
- My work here is over, Amaalik

25
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,555
But this country, you are living here

27
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:14,910
This is true the memory of my husband and I will always be in my heart

28
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:19,359

Should take the midgets
Sodershm, sir

33
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:41,754
Why?

34
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:48,309
Because I ... Believe that all the men on the ground
Jaioa them

35
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:52,313
But white men, and black people are

36
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:57,632
This is believed by Dr.
That was true then the famous

37
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,274
What is fame?

38
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,270
Everyone in the world will know who is

00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:11,388
Do you want to become king?
Take a small ....

Alhma Stzhpin reason with him?
- No, sir

42
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,398
If given you a lot of money?

43
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:31,191
I went to the forest, and took two small
Two of my men died

44
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,708

45
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:58,112
Can I carry this, Madam?

46
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:03,239
They do not belong to, we have given them to the king!

47
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:00,917
I think that we must bring the bird the next time, thank you

48
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:08,952

Wealth excited ahead Tmliny

51
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:22,588
To bring our dreams to verify

52
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:29,754
I do not understand!
What to say?

53
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:33,398
Midgets replace you curse
After that took them from the forest

54
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:38,038
Can not live outside of their world

55
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,959
At least we will take their bodies for study

56
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,792
Allen tell him what I said to you?

57
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:08,959
Move!

58
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:16,472

00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:22,069
Move! Rise!

61
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:32,637
Hey! Turned Adhirekm!

62
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:34,876
It is better that you speak
With the monkeys!

63
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,112
It is better to go without you

64
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:53,276
Come on all!
And you, darling, kidneys

65
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:01,868
Calm down

66
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:05,195
Stop!

67
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,911
Stay away! Now

68
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:20,948
I think you must know that I have to register as midgets
A group of monkeys developed

69
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,959
We do not want to take them to the slave traders

70
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:32,838
I do not want to get any risks, and risks are you

71
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:36,115
Let them deal ZACHARIE
He knows what to do

72
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:39,710
They are my responsibility

73
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:43,039
A mistake, they are not my responsibility and I want you
That descends to the bottom again

74
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:47,869
I do not like taking orders!
And especially you!

75
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:53,832
Let it is a proposal, I have taken this trip very much

76
00:13:54,480 --> 00:14:00,237
It is a work more for you
But Li ....

77
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:08,470
It is possible that these organisms have been found
On the ground before the rights of tens of years

78
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:13,309
When many species have become extinct, are Ngo

79
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:17,555
There could be many things at stake
However, the emergence of human

80
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:21,070
It is possible that we are talking about the origin of all life!

81
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:28,958
I will not let a trader Thidny wild animals through me

82
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:36,110
You are forbidden to go down under any circumstance

83
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:46,430
Dear friends, we have a satisfactory Asabny Adafny

00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:57,190
I am concerned them in my absence, I am afraid to injury

86
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:01,230
We sail across the sea the most ferocious

87
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:21,870
Dear doctor! Come quickly!

88
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:56,469

00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:32,395
Do not!

96
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:53,348
Stay away!

97
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:58,478
When you will learn?
You caught them

98
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:01,678
You can not never forget

99
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:37,157
Jaime from it, coming from Lisbon

100
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,677
The ship to dock in Khaddon days

101
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:42,400
My friends, there have been several problems ...

102
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:47,911
Problems, to delay .....
I would advise caution

103
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:52,439
Patients need to take care of

00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:58,670
Should strive for ....
That he did not even sign

105
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:03,393
- See the plan
- It's clear he is very ill

106
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:06,708
Does not seem a natural

107
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:09,152
We have completely changed

108
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:12,879
- Let me stay
- This is impossible, my dear

109
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,549
- We must stay the table beside your keyboard
- Abagel, has promised me

110
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:22,317
Why? Saquba sleep in the room

111
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:27,596
- I will not leave
- Yes Stflin!

112
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:31,594
Dear, kind, stubborn my sister

113
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:34,828
Fraser will not go ahead with the work as long as You are here

114
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:39,119
We have two months to give our cards to the academy, and we have a lot to do

115
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:42,713
Vehicle will take you to Ankara in the evening

116
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:48,793
Jaime has sent to this adventure
Because he does not have anything to lose

117
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:55,518
You can not Taamlny Thus, I will stay with my husband!

118
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:17,268
I'm afraid

119
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:22,230
I have a bad feeling with regard to all this

120
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:27,835
I always thought that your idea is crazy

121
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:36,678
Our research will have a huge sound in the world

122
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:48,633
If I prayed to learn how to fail Jimmy

123
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:18,509
Prevent myself not to think ....
What if the dead?

124

Here is Sqrna, he is calm now
Now, and is Allbup

Be careful not close many of the monkeys, it could become dangerous

127
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:40,037
And the tiger, and a small otter

128
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:44,194

My friends, you do not know my time and I am thinking of you

136
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:38,308
There were days where I thought I would see you again

137
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:44,353
Is everything okay?

138
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:47,439
Do you still alive?

00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:51,391
Praise be to God
Are still alive!

140
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:56,316

Please tell me how Abiek something I do not?

King MATIKO Seko, who Atany

I'm ready to put them at your disposal for a period of 3 months

145
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:17,993

We Nmtllekem!

00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,789
No one outside of Africa
They have the midgets

149
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:29,948
Such a civilized country
This is called slavery

150
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:37,753
Do you think it is possible
Confidence in Ms. Van Dan Eden?

151
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:44,714
As long as we are all working on our common interests
I think this

152
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:50,637
So we

153
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:54,992
Will pull the paper
And I would like to congratulate Dr. Dodd

154
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:59,397
Without it, these were not successful mission

155
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:13,597
We are!

156
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:46,391
I did not dream that I've never said that this day

157
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:52,834
You're right, Jimmy
These our own

158
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:59,314
I want to remind you that Azaviva savage jungles of Africa

159
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:04,318
They are very dangerous and of the Cannibal

160
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:11,513
We do not know the extent of alien diseases they carry

161
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:14,957
So stay away and you will be safe

162
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:20,876
Brought food and water to the mill
And we will rest

163
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:24,836
Mr. McBride, Dr. Dodd and I am
Are the only ones who Seronna

164
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:29,879
No one should know about them
Even put them on the Academy

165
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:32,831
But what about you and the others, sir?

166
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:37,348
Well, that knowledge includes some risks

167
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:42,194
But do not worry, we will take all means caution

168
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:54,195
- Is everything okay?
- As usual, sir

169
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:21,356
Do you slept at all?
- Each end

170
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:27,756
- Do you see them sleeping with each other?
- Sleeping with each other? Why?

171
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:31,910
That curiosity
Scientific curiosity

172
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:35,910
- Is the female is a presumption mentioned?
- Not, as I know

173
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:42,478
I do not have any idea what some of them Imtloh

174
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:48,193
We will attack them, we believe that they would
Slept in the same time

175
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:52,435
Or they are waiting for the opportunity to attack us

176
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:40,919
- What to do?

177
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:43,959
Amazing!

178
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:52,959
America! Stop!

179
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:01,356

00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:59,432
Return! America, stop!

184
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:04,436
Open the door!
Vries, head of the door! Get out!

185
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:19,079
Breathe! Breathe!

You have not finished yet ......
Your account will be with me long

Breathing a sigh of relief!

188
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:45,111
Athtajny something, Mr. Duncan?

189
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:50,799
I am concerned, I have heard the shots
Fire coming from the mill

190
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:56,031
Yes, we have launched some shots
Do you know why, Mr. Duncan?

191
00:28:57,120 --> 00:29:02,069
We are studying the degree of feelings savages ....

00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:47,149
Let us, there is nothing to be lost

196
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:03,718
"Three blind mice, look how are ..."

197
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:10,758
"Dragged behind the farmer's wife and cut off tail
Away from the scissors "

No, it is true

00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:35,512
Great apes are under 50 degrees

206

Negrophobia, usually above the age of 70
And the Mongol between 73 and 77

Between more and less monkeys Taattora civilized human beings

210
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:05,156
Do you know what does that mean?

211
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:07,359
How Tokdk?

212
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:11,868

We have confirmed and confirmed again

214

Oh my God!

215
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:28,677
It seems that the world is ...

216
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:33,269
The information that they were Adam and Eve
Black men and young women

217
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:37,193
Will have to repaint the church Sistn

218
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:45,190
When left alone, may have been disturbed in any way?

219
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:51,710
No, not panic
The wrong word, my dear

220
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:56,995
This requires the kind of intelligence and emotion

221
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:02,434
Tnaiina and away from the sense of
Thousands of years

222
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:25,829
Wait here!

No one! But I think you will not leave me to believe that

225
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:44,029
If successful, will forgive you .....

226

Madam, what you are here, it will be necessary to help you with respect ....

246
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:15,392
I do not think any of us have been .....

247
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:30,477
I understand it, what can I say?
It is a private matter

248
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:34,316
- It seems a little ....
- Penetration of privacy?

249
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:38,919
Very well

250
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:42,279
I think you should Trhaloua!

251
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:17,598
Certainly she's a woman

252
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:33,833
Why all this?

253
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:37,510
Nmliha and get shot
On the right area ....

254
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:40,435
Of the skull, and this we can measure
The volume of their brains

255
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:51,553
They wake up!

256
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:01,268
Oh my God, well, I Omsktha

257
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:09,839

261
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:47,155
They think that the spirit may
They were taken

262
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:49,951
The Stsagtl Nevshl

263
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:53,833
Do you see them?

264
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:58,272
No, and I hear the screams the vilest
Cries are not human

265
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:02,833
And were not the first time
Must Nkrjhm from here

266
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:05,828
They are evil
They have the forces of evil

267
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:11,230
This is nonsense, what evil they have done to you?

268
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:16,592
When suffering from a serious illness,
For 3 days now

269
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:20,310
Legendary Tjnnt, she did not sleep at night

270
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:23,712

You can not ...

It is a crisis of usury
It is possible to die ....

275
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:05,359
Quickly!

276
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:16,918
Bring me a lantern
He held his head high

277
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:26,319
He held his head!

278
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:33,959
Oh damned!

279
00:44:36,680 --> 00:44:39,956

Dear black irksome

00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:01,472
Long overdue, sir, as well as we

282
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:16,712
I move aside!

283
00:45:18,440 --> 00:45:22,069
Douglas died, sir
Barbarians kill him

284
00:45:22,840 --> 00:45:25,638
Fleurhm the spirit of the Lord

285
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:53,360
Dispersed in small groups

286
00:45:53,560 --> 00:45:56,757
Twdhuhm not in any way
I want them alive

287
00:45:57,280 --> 00:46:00,238
Any man will answer me Siwvem

288
00:46:09,080 --> 00:46:13,232
- Sirunhm animals ...
- What if they were human beings?

289
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:15,789
Then, they Qatlon
And our work will be completed

290
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:18,878
- Must find them first
- Follow the rapidly

291
00:46:19,600 --> 00:46:22,797
Madam, on the forest Senltv

292
00:46:30,080 --> 00:46:34,153
Come on guys, to remove these savages!

293
00:46:55,120 --> 00:46:56,553
Can we look at?

294
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:58,154
I'll be there!

295
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:02,554
Well, we got them!

296
00:47:13,480 --> 00:47:15,869
It is better to leave us move Dr. Dodd
We know what to do

297
00:47:21,720 --> 00:47:23,119
Damn you!

298
00:47:24,360 --> 00:47:29,832
Dogs went to the south
Of course we're close!

299
00:48:47,240 --> 00:48:48,798
Oh my God!

300
00:48:55,080 --> 00:48:58,117
Akhvadwa down your arms!
Stay away dogs!

301
00:48:58,320 --> 00:49:00,231
We can force Nmskhm now!

302
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:02,710
Douglas has been killed!
And attacked Mr. McBride!

303
00:49:02,920 --> 00:49:04,911
The incident, one would not blame them

304
00:49:05,160 --> 00:49:08,038
It was a terrible accident

305
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:10,630
Kdhuhm to the police, sir

306
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:13,634
- Will kill him
- Kept you, man

307
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:26,310
Jaime, stop!

308
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:31,795
Hist! Hist!

309
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:34,196
Hist! Hist!

310
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:01,159
You did it

311
00:50:03,320 --> 00:50:04,719
I did what?

312
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:07,713
In the battle, you have a gun

313
00:50:09,360 --> 00:50:13,399
And opened fire by mistake
Hit by Douglas

314
00:50:14,520 --> 00:50:16,158
Alexander, what do you say?

315
00:50:16,360 --> 00:50:20,592
It was a terrible accident, a human being

316
00:50:20,680 --> 00:50:24,150
- Is Jnnt?
- There is no one Ilomk

317
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:27,359
But we must absolve the midgets

318
00:50:27,560 --> 00:50:30,438
Do you want me to admit to crime he had not done it?

319
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:37,114
Yes! It was Gbaik who brought us here

320
00:50:37,320 --> 00:50:39,117
Could go to prison

321
00:50:39,320 --> 00:50:41,470
Not because of the incident

322
00:50:44,120 --> 00:50:46,236
Will be an official investigation

323
00:50:50,120 --> 00:50:54,398
Just think, the dangers in this

324
00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:04,476
Please, Fraser
As the only solution

325
00:51:16,040 --> 00:51:17,439
We are losing time

326
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:23,951
We need more of this, many

327
00:51:25,120 --> 00:51:27,759
Are you two!
Azhba to the long -

328
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:35,714
We are losing time, let us!

329
00:51:36,920 --> 00:51:39,480
Must recognize their camp
But under the Hracetkm

330
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:43,479
Do you know what happened to Douglas?

331
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:04,359
No! Move aside!

332
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:17,955
Do not wait!
He was away evil spirits

333
00:52:18,920 --> 00:52:21,673
- Tell them to reduce their weapons
- We will not accept any risk

334
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:24,072
Racboh guys!

335
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:28,792
What are you doing? Arbthm!

336
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:33,352
Should be in the woods
And not Simutwa

337
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:34,919
This is madness!

338
00:52:35,080 --> 00:52:38,595
After last night and they know we are the only protection

339
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:41,030
- Will flee
- Not the presence of these men and dogs

340
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:43,589
Kzhm back to the mill

341
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:47,993
If the two bodies will be submitted to the Academy!

342
00:52:48,640 --> 00:52:50,676
Racbohem guys

343
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:03,033
There is nothing that concerns me the most impressive success

344
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:05,198
Trust me, Alexander

345
00:53:19,478 --> 00:53:20,877
Stop!

346
00:53:21,558 --> 00:53:23,867
Proved
Tsepk will not hurt

347
00:53:53,358 --> 00:53:58,512
We have been looking for a wound
I thought that Douglas

348
00:53:59,318 --> 00:54:02,708
She knows that she killed him
They feel guilty!

349
00:54:03,278 --> 00:54:07,476
- This is not reasonable
- But worse, it is preposterous

350
00:54:07,838 --> 00:54:10,557
Anzera to act
Silence, grief .....

351
00:54:10,878 --> 00:54:14,712
No! Will not listen to more of this

352
00:54:14,918 --> 00:54:17,591
You are the world and I am not a magician

353
00:54:18,918 --> 00:54:20,874
Why has opened the cage for the night?

354
00:54:21,798 --> 00:54:26,918
I have heard Toko fighting for breath, suffering
You of the same

355
00:54:27,678 --> 00:54:30,523
Your mercy has provoked
And he set a trap

356
00:54:30,558 --> 00:54:36,076
Like all the fishermen Savages
Know how to draw the victim

357
00:54:36,238 --> 00:54:42,347
Every day I see nothing in them
Why .....

358
00:54:43,478 --> 00:54:47,391
I doubt, I think our theory

359
00:54:47,518 --> 00:54:50,908
Do you doubt the validity of our work?

360
00:54:51,878 --> 00:54:53,914
These organisms may have lived ....

361
00:54:55,078 --> 00:55:01,426
In the woods, unknown to the outside world

362
00:55:02,238 --> 00:55:06,789
And I see signs of intelligence and feelings ....

363
00:55:07,798 --> 00:55:09,595
Similar to the one that we have 

364
00:55:11,238 --> 00:55:13,752
It is possible that this will be the greatest Akchavatna

365
00:55:15,038 --> 00:55:16,790
Must know more

366
00:55:17,678 --> 00:55:20,750
Must therefore be to our academic committees

367
00:55:22,158 --> 00:55:26,276
No, not wrong

368
00:55:27,838 --> 00:55:33,788
Have the facts and figures and specific information
Comparisons right ....

369
00:55:34,278 --> 00:55:38,237
And all they have ... You are you, Jaime

370
00:55:38,758 --> 00:55:41,272
Is ambiguous feelings

371
00:55:43,318 --> 00:55:46,549
It was not enough
I want proof

372
00:55:59,478 --> 00:56:00,627
One

373
00:56:02,438 --> 00:56:03,712
Two

374
00:56:07,798 --> 00:56:08,947
Three

375
00:56:12,038 --> 00:56:14,506
Do not let me down, Toko.

376
00:56:14,838 --> 00:56:18,035
I know the extent of Zkaik and we must see it to others

377
00:56:18,238 --> 00:56:21,275
I've you are like me!
Come Toko!

378
00:56:21,478 --> 00:56:23,355
Us has been! Us has been!

379
00:56:32,678 --> 00:56:34,157
I do not believe that

380
00:56:37,118 --> 00:56:40,235
- Must not stay away
- Hdye of Roek, dear

381
00:56:45,718 --> 00:56:49,472
Yes, it was terrible accident

382
00:56:50,958 --> 00:56:52,516
Douglas poor!

383
00:56:53,158 --> 00:56:54,910
I can not believe you could have .....

384
00:56:56,438 --> 00:56:58,508
I took the family is well

385
00:56:59,518 --> 00:57:02,510
- A generous pension
- How can you talk about the money?

386
00:57:03,238 --> 00:57:04,830
I took them

387
00:57:06,958 --> 00:57:08,516
Fraser was killed a man!

388
00:57:10,878 --> 00:57:13,597
How to live a happy and is aware of this?

389
00:57:19,158 --> 00:57:20,989
Oattny your hand

390
00:57:22,318 --> 00:57:23,831
Everything is fine

391
00:57:27,558 --> 00:57:28,707
Abhamk ...

392
00:58:12,678 --> 00:58:18,787
Dr. Dodd, you mean that the brains of women
About four-fifths of the man's brain?

393
00:58:19,878 --> 00:58:21,994
Speak generally

394
00:58:23,438 --> 00:58:26,430
If, as Jaddaolk, the brains ....

395
00:58:26,798 --> 00:58:29,995
The equivalent of almost an African man's brain?

396
00:58:30,598 --> 00:58:31,917
Almost

397
00:58:33,918 --> 00:58:36,637
Assumed that poor women Alhzina ....

398
00:58:37,518 --> 00:58:39,588
Even the women of others will be normal ....

399
00:58:39,878 --> 00:58:43,791
More than leave the impression of a woman you
Negress normal

400
00:58:50,638 --> 00:58:56,429
When the dwarfs will be
Your success is unprecedented

401
00:58:59,278 --> 00:59:01,792
Scientists and scholars from all assets
Across Europe ...

402
00:59:01,958 --> 00:59:04,472
Seudon to come and see them and study

403
00:59:05,878 --> 00:59:07,516
People Sionnbhron

404
00:59:08,678 --> 00:59:12,876
The main request: Berlin
France, Amsterdam ....

405
00:59:16,438 --> 00:59:20,909
Midgets trust that your
The Rodthm

406
00:59:21,078 --> 00:59:22,352
I do not know

407
00:59:27,838 --> 00:59:28,907
Dr. Dodd ....

408
00:59:32,798 --> 00:59:36,313
I would be very happy if you come with me and ...

409
00:59:38,958 --> 00:59:40,789
What?

410
00:59:44,398 --> 00:59:46,434
I think we are excellent alliance

411
00:59:54,718 --> 00:59:56,037
Alliance?

412
00:59:58,958 --> 01:00:01,836
Midgets would Itrhaloua in Europe

413
01:00:02,478 --> 01:00:04,833
Will die, will not continue for a week

414
01:00:06,918 --> 01:00:08,749
In any case, I would come back to them

415
01:00:12,838 --> 01:00:14,157
To Africa

416
01:00:15,558 --> 01:00:16,877
You are too late

417
01:00:18,238 --> 01:00:20,274
Will not prevent the whole world of curiosity

418
01:00:21,238 --> 01:00:26,107
I will not allow you the composition of the wealth of their offer

419
01:00:27,198 --> 01:00:31,157
You remember very well who you are
I came to them from the forest

420
01:00:31,918 --> 01:00:34,193
This is your experience, and not me!

421
01:00:34,518 --> 01:00:38,352
You Tqrsm and Tkhaddarham and Taatvhsm

422
01:00:38,518 --> 01:00:42,750
And do not need any lessons about the offer you, sir!

423
01:01:35,558 --> 01:01:37,116
Stay here

424
01:01:37,438 --> 01:01:39,747
Let's see what it intends to Siadna small

425
01:02:59,078 --> 01:03:00,306
Frey secret ....

426
01:03:04,678 --> 01:03:05,952
Agent

427
01:03:11,638 --> 01:03:12,991
Stop here

428
01:05:30,398 --> 01:05:33,037
Jaime ... Forgive me

429
01:05:35,438 --> 01:05:36,757
It is important

430
01:05:37,198 --> 01:05:39,871
Alexander wants to see you
I have discovered something

431
01:05:41,598 --> 01:05:43,668
Is Halvk any luck with the song of the agent?

432
01:05:44,158 --> 01:05:49,471
I'm sorry, did not distinguish anything
Like the song of birds ...

433
01:05:50,118 --> 01:05:52,029
You can not really call this music

434
01:06:01,878 --> 01:06:03,516
Jaime Come and see

435
01:06:03,998 --> 01:06:06,717
I think they paint something on the walls

436
01:06:08,198 --> 01:06:09,551
See!

437
01:06:14,038 --> 01:06:15,266
Fewer?

438
01:06:15,918 --> 01:06:17,829
I'm sorry, I can not see anything

439
01:06:24,518 --> 01:06:27,032
What are you doing?
Open the door

440
01:06:28,958 --> 01:06:32,997
No, I will not refuse to open
Loss ...

441
01:06:33,238 --> 01:06:35,798
All because of Jnonk

442
01:06:36,478 --> 01:06:39,709
We have trained these midgets against me!

443
01:06:40,318 --> 01:06:42,673
Barbaric people tried to micro -

444
01:06:44,718 --> 01:06:46,993
What do you want to speak?

445
01:06:50,958 --> 01:06:54,314
Where are they?
Them they need me

446
01:06:55,078 --> 01:06:57,387
They are safe, that's all you need to know

447
01:06:57,918 --> 01:06:59,715
Etjhezwn great day for

448
01:06:59,918 --> 01:07:03,877
- The Avethm ...
- You are not against me?

449
01:07:04,518 --> 01:07:06,509
Amama trying to destroy everything?

450
01:07:08,078 --> 01:07:14,711
The issue is not me and you
We took the wrong road

451
01:07:14,958 --> 01:07:19,270
It is a criminal act that the midgets
They are the missing link

452
01:07:19,678 --> 01:07:22,511
How dare?
How?

453
01:07:25,478 --> 01:07:27,230
Get your hands on my neck

454
01:07:27,958 --> 01:07:29,550
Where are they?

455
01:07:29,798 --> 01:07:33,268
Dragged me!
Beyond me your hands!

456
01:07:35,238 --> 01:07:37,832
Open the door!
Where are they?

457
01:07:42,998 --> 01:07:44,113
Kept him here

458
01:07:49,318 --> 01:07:51,115
Dr. Dodd very ill

459
01:07:52,238 --> 01:07:54,627
Infection of the barbarians

460
01:07:57,398 --> 01:07:58,831
Do not let anyone enter!

461
01:08:03,398 --> 01:08:07,471
The history of humanity is like the giant tree ....

462
01:08:07,718 --> 01:08:10,676
And we believe that only the upper branches of which ...

463
01:08:10,998 --> 01:08:14,035
This prompts the question
Where do I come?

464
01:08:15,198 --> 01:08:17,666
Where are our roots?

465
01:08:20,118 --> 01:08:23,633
Today, we can distinguish three veins:

466
01:08:24,038 --> 01:08:25,869
White or Caucasian

467
01:08:26,078 --> 01:08:27,875
Yellow, or Asian

468
01:08:28,078 --> 01:08:30,467
And Black, or Black

469
01:08:31,198 --> 01:08:33,996
And among them there are many segments

470
01:08:34,398 --> 01:08:37,037
Caucasus Alarien
And American Indians .....

471
01:08:37,158 --> 01:08:40,275
Australians Alabroujaon and finally black Filebenion

472
01:08:41,918 --> 01:08:51,793
And now I have the honor to provide evidence of a new race

473
01:08:52,958 --> 01:08:56,155
The oldest of any other strain

474
01:09:03,478 --> 01:09:10,190
And I must say that at the time of my them, for the first time ....

475
01:09:12,518 --> 01:09:18,229
I felt Columbus discovered America

476
01:09:19,638 --> 01:09:23,108
And most important question we ask is:
Do midgets who put them ....

477
01:09:23,278 --> 01:09:29,194
Are the missing link between apes and humans?

478
01:09:49,078 --> 01:09:52,468
They are one of the most primitive humans so far

479
01:09:53,198 --> 01:09:55,871
And took us several weeks to study

480
01:09:56,278 --> 01:09:59,350
Mental strength is very weak

481
01:09:59,918 --> 01:10:01,874
Strongly hostile

482
01:10:02,758 --> 01:10:07,354
Lack of innocence and personal habits, disgusting

483
01:10:07,918 --> 01:10:10,990
These are the animals closest to the barbarians

484
01:10:21,878 --> 01:10:23,072
Dr. Dodd, all!

485
01:10:31,558 --> 01:10:33,037
Must eat

486
01:10:42,998 --> 01:10:46,388
Five feet and inches
Weight and six blocks and three pounds

487
01:10:46,998 --> 01:10:50,957
Noticed the presence of the disengagement Broujnaty, such as wool and hair ...

488
01:10:51,838 --> 01:10:55,035
Facial angles and levels of less than human

489
01:10:55,998 --> 01:11:00,196
And angles in simple backbone ....

490
01:11:00,478 --> 01:11:03,948
Indicate that the object had spent little time
Standing on its feet

491
01:11:05,838 --> 01:11:07,954
See the same impact on the Orange Order parades monkey

492
01:11:08,718 --> 01:11:11,790
Compared with the size of the brain and the size of the human race

493
01:11:12,038 --> 01:11:15,508
Will give us the right of genius

494
01:11:17,958 --> 01:11:20,552
Brain the size of 47 cubic inches

495
01:11:21,278 --> 01:11:27,069
And the skull itself, the kind of Albrocibrany ...

496
01:11:27,398 --> 01:11:30,037
And the curvature of the front section, reminds us of the human being Alnedraly ...

497
01:11:30,478 --> 01:11:34,027
In view of the extinction of our figures and analyzes ...

498
01:11:34,598 --> 01:11:40,275
The grades and the distinctive H.thm Assembly ....

499
01:11:41,598 --> 01:11:47,548
In their actions, we believe we have found the first section ...

500
01:11:47,758 --> 01:11:50,431
Tree which grew in the humanitarian

501
01:12:42,278 --> 01:12:43,757
Congratulations

502
01:12:44,318 --> 01:12:46,912
We have a lot of debate in which
Must come to visit our

503
01:12:47,238 --> 01:12:49,433
Gentlemen, please attention please

504
01:12:50,438 --> 01:12:55,592
I want to say that, Dr. Dodd ...

505
01:12:55,798 --> 01:12:58,471
And is one of the dearest friends
But chose to come with us today

506
01:12:58,718 --> 01:13:02,154
He did not share all of our performance

507
01:13:03,158 --> 01:13:08,152
Dr. Dodd is that he is behind the brutality

508
01:13:09,998 --> 01:13:12,387
These creatures, there is intelligence and a sense of

509
01:13:14,598 --> 01:13:20,116
He thought he saw, including human assets

510
01:13:24,438 --> 01:13:29,956
He believes that the overall rating and strain ....

511
01:13:31,638 --> 01:13:33,549
For all races must be tested!

512
01:13:39,238 --> 01:13:40,557
Stay successor

513
01:13:59,238 --> 01:14:00,796
Come on! Move!

514
01:14:27,998 --> 01:14:29,590
Look at them!

515
01:14:36,318 --> 01:14:40,709
Midgets Sishron Parisians

516
01:14:41,638 --> 01:14:43,788
I predict the success of an unprecedented

517
01:14:44,198 --> 01:14:46,837
To the holding of credible with Ms. Van Dan Eden

518
01:14:47,198 --> 01:14:50,588
Sokz Pygmies in my garden until the end of summer

519
01:14:51,198 --> 01:14:55,953
You Stvutin season in Paris

520
01:14:56,478 --> 01:14:58,196
Dear patient must Count

521
01:14:58,998 --> 01:15:03,514
Can I close them?

522
01:15:04,198 --> 01:15:07,952
I am a simple Bedazzle always new discoveries

523
01:15:08,718 --> 01:15:13,553
That formed Verhmont others had expressed interest in a regular

524
01:15:15,878 --> 01:15:17,311
Is not that true, Fraser?

525
01:15:17,918 --> 01:15:20,478
What? Yes, certainly

526
01:15:21,558 --> 01:15:25,471
I do not have any objections, may govern us
A visit to Mr. Bickensil?

527
01:15:26,958 --> 01:15:31,509
We have requests from all over Europe to visit

528
01:15:32,598 --> 01:15:36,227
It seems that everyone wants to look
Primitive life

529
01:15:37,998 --> 01:15:40,228
And thanks to my brother and my husband

530
01:15:40,478 --> 01:15:43,311
They are the ones who began this Aljno ....

531
01:15:43,598 --> 01:15:48,513
I forgot Dr. Dodd, I have heard that it is not okay

532
01:15:49,718 --> 01:15:52,186
Is it possible that you dress encouraging news?

533
01:16:00,438 --> 01:16:03,032
The disease, which required Dr. Dodd does not have a cure

534
01:16:04,118 --> 01:16:05,949
I do not think one can do anything to help

535
01:16:07,558 --> 01:16:08,957
Jaime poor

536
01:16:11,518 --> 01:16:15,227
No need to worry, Dr. Dodd
The fever is over

537
01:16:19,878 --> 01:16:21,914
I think that you can go home now

538
01:17:22,158 --> 01:17:23,591
Agent!

539
01:17:32,598 --> 01:17:33,633
Toko!

540
01:17:35,438 --> 01:17:37,349
Toko said Jaime I

541
01:17:44,158 --> 01:17:45,557
I'm Jaime!

542
01:17:49,838 --> 01:17:51,157
Toko Gold

543
01:17:57,838 --> 01:17:59,430
Toko died

544
01:18:07,198 --> 01:18:08,790
Toko died!

545
01:18:10,798 --> 01:18:15,235
Why do not they eat? Why are they tired and inactive?

546
01:18:15,558 --> 01:18:18,026
They are thus useless Li
What happened

547
01:18:18,558 --> 01:18:19,877
That's a good question

548
01:18:19,958 --> 01:18:24,907
I find it remarkable that you knew that Tdersohm

549
01:18:25,318 --> 01:18:30,267
I assure you they were insusceptible
Have not had such problems

550
01:18:31,438 --> 01:18:33,508
Toko .... I do as I do

551
01:18:50,758 --> 01:18:52,396
Madam, Good Day Feltenamoa Gentlemen

552
01:19:13,278 --> 01:19:19,274
ZACHARIE, there will be a presentation of the day

553
01:19:36,718 --> 01:19:40,267
I am very grateful to you, Dr. O, good luck

554
01:19:45,838 --> 01:19:49,990
Did not eat for four days

555
01:20:05,558 --> 01:20:10,507
Very good
I am proud of you ....

556
01:20:47,718 --> 01:20:49,197
Kidneys

557
01:20:59,718 --> 01:21:01,390
All you Toko

558
01:21:04,238 --> 01:21:05,956
Toko must eat!

559
01:21:08,198 --> 01:21:10,109
Agent ... Two

560
01:21:31,078 --> 01:21:32,306
Baby

561
01:21:40,478 --> 01:21:44,517
Baby
Us has been

562
01:21:46,958 --> 01:21:49,677
Children, were Us

563
01:21:55,558 --> 01:22:01,190
Midgets actions had brought some doubt

564
01:22:02,158 --> 01:22:08,427
Even there is no interest in knowing their assets

565
01:22:09,598 --> 01:22:12,715
I can not stop them from asset scientists now

566
01:22:12,958 --> 01:22:15,995
We have paid a good amount of Li

567
01:22:17,998 --> 01:22:19,716
Make permission to do so

568
01:22:21,238 --> 01:22:25,356
It Tojarham circus artists Avrgiin

569
01:22:26,438 --> 01:22:29,111
Make it say that contracts are null

570
01:22:30,958 --> 01:22:36,032
Prevent any visit I make midgets more vulnerable

571
01:22:36,558 --> 01:22:40,836
They need only one Dr.
I will stay on their side

572
01:22:43,958 --> 01:22:47,428
Let us agree on the fact ...

573
01:22:47,998 --> 01:22:51,149
You can Thassanhm
Is the solution?

574
01:22:53,078 --> 01:22:56,866
You are on the verge of the first in Europe Tchehdouallmrp ....

575
01:22:57,038 --> 01:23:01,077
Real-life in the jungles of Tanzania Africa

576
01:23:02,398 --> 01:23:06,073
Agent! The greatest fire!
Toko! Go fishing!

577
01:23:23,278 --> 01:23:25,234
Agent! More fire!

578
01:23:26,318 --> 01:23:28,354
Toko! More fishing!

579
01:23:37,718 --> 01:23:39,390
What is he doing?

580
01:23:40,638 --> 01:23:42,196
Tejevohm not!

581
01:23:45,678 --> 01:23:47,430
Do you know how to use it?

582
01:23:48,118 --> 01:23:51,793
Yes, my God, she knew!
Must stop!

583
01:24:09,718 --> 01:24:11,595
This is not likely! This is insulting!

584
01:24:11,958 --> 01:24:13,676
Us has been! Us has been!

585
01:24:28,558 --> 01:24:30,071
Let's get out of here

586
01:24:44,078 --> 01:24:45,227
Very funny ....

587
01:24:53,158 --> 01:24:54,352
Thank you

588
01:24:55,118 --> 01:24:58,508
Some say you are crazy
And some say you are genius

589
01:24:59,278 --> 01:25:04,557
Alexander says you are trained, is this true?

590
01:25:05,638 --> 01:25:09,870
- No Odrihm
- And what about you control them?

591
01:25:10,038 --> 01:25:12,313
Is also governed
Mr. Bovis are implemented ....

592
01:25:12,998 --> 01:25:17,276
What I will tell you, but I do not how do I manage

593
01:25:17,878 --> 01:25:22,906
That the same thing with them
We understand each other with

594
01:25:25,718 --> 01:25:27,356
They like you and like me

595
01:25:50,718 --> 01:25:52,037
Frey secret

596
01:26:24,518 --> 01:26:25,871
Certainly she is pregnant

597
01:26:27,078 --> 01:26:31,230
It is doubtful that the baboons could
Felt that the pregnancy

598
01:26:31,518 --> 01:26:34,635
- Are you quite sure?
- I do not have conclusive evidence

599
01:26:35,438 --> 01:26:39,431
If we can take from the female fetus
Would be ideal ...

600
01:26:39,998 --> 01:26:45,026
This is the ideal, it will not need them later

601
01:26:45,838 --> 01:26:50,514
Will take to all parts of Europe for public performances

602
01:26:50,998 --> 01:26:55,435
That we have the ability of abortion that the fetus
We can see more .....

603
01:26:55,758 --> 01:26:58,830
Of the difference between the human embryo and the other

604
01:26:59,118 --> 01:27:02,633
We are talking about her!

605
01:27:03,078 --> 01:27:06,673
We are talking about a fetus from a scientific sample

606
01:27:08,278 --> 01:27:11,031
Must steer the uncertainty
We crawl

607
01:27:12,798 --> 01:27:14,709
This is our chance

608
01:27:17,318 --> 01:27:19,115
That is what will make Asameena ....

609
01:27:25,198 --> 01:27:26,870
Do not look!

610
01:27:31,278 --> 01:27:32,677
Turning the other hand,

611
01:27:34,958 --> 01:27:37,108
The talk of the town

612
01:27:39,278 --> 01:27:43,669
Dr. Dodd, are you okay?
Is there a smile on your face?

613
01:27:44,158 --> 01:27:46,626
This concert should not be turned into a
Aristocratic nightclub

614
01:27:47,118 --> 01:27:50,588
Will not be as well, from the generosity of Sir Walter
To organize such a concert

615
01:27:51,838 --> 01:27:55,990
And how Stjnin them?
Mrs. Van Dan Eden ...

616
01:27:56,958 --> 01:28:02,237
Exactly like you, you three, we have agreed
Half and half, Li you

617
01:28:03,718 --> 01:28:09,475
Everyone will be there
Important people, and the rich ....

618
01:28:12,438 --> 01:28:15,430
If they do not defend what ratified,
It is Spfl?

619
01:28:17,478 --> 01:28:19,469
We are allies now

620
01:28:20,518 --> 01:28:23,271
I hope it does not find the merger is very painful

621
01:28:24,958 --> 01:28:30,555
Why, therefore, important to
11 31 59 14 99 32 04 10
They are all your guests

622
01:28:36,278 --> 01:28:38,917
This shows they are all free

623
01:28:41,958 --> 01:28:46,270
And that freedom is not exactly a moral

624
01:28:46,958 --> 01:28:50,507
It is an honor for me to announce,
And thanks to the Tipetkm .....

625
01:28:51,558 --> 01:28:56,268
And generosity of others to our host, the ordinary ....

626
01:28:57,758 --> 01:29:02,115
Will not return to the park is not Toko agent

627
01:29:03,198 --> 01:29:05,029
They are free right now

628
01:29:05,798 --> 01:29:09,188
- Are free to return to their land
- Or are free to stay here

629
01:29:09,558 --> 01:29:13,233
We will be happy to offer hospitality

630
01:29:18,838 --> 01:29:20,351
Thank you

631
01:29:21,638 --> 01:29:23,833
I asked the last request of you

632
01:29:24,758 --> 01:29:31,834
Do not see that they are strangers Dioufkm
Or they are strange creatures

633
01:29:33,118 --> 01:29:35,586
Taamilon treated them as friends

634
01:29:35,998 --> 01:29:38,512
And the responses you Stphajion

635
01:29:53,198 --> 01:29:56,031
Mr. Walter, the oldest of you ..... Agent

636
01:29:57,878 --> 01:29:59,675

Tell them your name first

640
01:30:24,238 --> 01:30:27,310
- Andrew
- Agent

641
01:30:33,518 --> 01:30:34,997
Hello, Toko

642
01:30:36,198 --> 01:30:37,790
Hello you in Edinburgh

643
01:30:56,638 --> 01:30:59,948
Very good, Dr. Dodd
The Ohbohem

644
01:31:00,118 --> 01:31:01,915
You deserve this

645
01:31:02,958 --> 01:31:06,030
I know you suffered a lot and I would like to take
Midgets to me ....

646
01:31:06,238 --> 01:31:10,868
To the park again, they know we are so far Saity

647
01:31:24,278 --> 01:31:28,032
Ducks, fish and a lot of fruit
Must try

648
01:32:01,878 --> 01:32:03,596
Hjratkm from here

649
01:32:03,998 --> 01:32:08,230
Are you sure that thugs will not kill us in the Frahna?

650
01:32:08,838 --> 01:32:12,672
Certainly, I do not know how to thank you, sir

651
01:32:12,958 --> 01:32:17,076
Ckrny not, the idea has been a colleague

652
01:32:17,598 --> 01:32:22,114
- Mrs. Van Dan Eden?
- No, Fraser McBride

653
01:32:23,718 --> 01:32:26,152
Forgive me!
Toko!

654
01:32:38,998 --> 01:32:40,351
Gently, gently

655
01:32:43,198 --> 01:32:44,551
Do not let anyone enter

656
01:32:54,238 --> 01:32:56,991
Let us!
There is no time to lose!

657
01:32:57,238 --> 01:32:59,593
How do you know they took her to the museum?

658
01:32:59,838 --> 01:33:01,794
Alexander said there was a

659
01:33:01,958 --> 01:33:04,791
A safe place, and everything I know!

660
01:33:09,198 --> 01:33:12,076
It must be learned she was pregnant
So think in concert

661
01:33:12,798 --> 01:33:14,470
There is a Echttvoha

662
01:33:15,758 --> 01:33:18,147
I would like to believe that you do not have
A hand in this!

663
01:33:18,478 --> 01:33:24,917
How dare to suggest something like this
I have no idea!

664
01:33:27,158 --> 01:33:29,035
I am in you

665
01:33:37,918 --> 01:33:39,192
They are ready

666
01:33:39,598 --> 01:33:42,066
Is it possible to confirm the status of the patient?

667
01:33:53,638 --> 01:33:55,435
Frey secret ....

668
01:33:58,038 --> 01:33:59,357
Us has been

669
01:34:07,638 --> 01:34:09,276
Well, is it?

670
01:34:11,318 --> 01:34:13,115
I can not stress

671
01:34:13,518 --> 01:34:15,554
Oh my God!
Brofficr!

672
01:34:20,158 --> 01:34:22,877
- Open the gate now!
- Should not be blasting them with a

673
01:34:23,158 --> 01:34:25,911
I call on the vision of scientists

674
01:34:27,238 --> 01:34:28,796
Do you learn from me?

675
01:34:30,078 --> 01:34:33,787
If I open the door and do not waste more time

676
01:34:39,078 --> 01:34:42,514
It is definitely pregnant
Will Nkhaddrha

677
01:34:49,158 --> 01:34:50,716
Stay away from routes

678
01:34:51,158 --> 01:34:53,752
This is a humanitarian
We can not do that

679
01:35:00,158 --> 01:35:01,716
We must start

680
01:35:10,238 --> 01:35:11,751
Oh my God!

681
01:35:15,758 --> 01:35:17,828
What do you think the right of the Lord?

682
01:35:19,558 --> 01:35:20,911
Take Action!

683
01:35:21,838 --> 01:35:24,477
You may not be present here, are you skip the border

684
01:35:24,838 --> 01:35:27,113
How dare that we talked about breaking the law?

685
01:35:27,598 --> 01:35:32,274
Laws do not apply to primitive creatures

686
01:35:33,118 --> 01:35:35,791
Study of the fetus is inevitable!

687
01:35:37,558 --> 01:35:43,474
Not seeing it! In respect of the Child, which could be my child!

688
01:35:49,078 --> 01:35:51,148
You must flout us!

689
01:35:51,598 --> 01:35:54,112
You'll see when the child is born

690
01:35:54,398 --> 01:35:57,470
No, get out! Get out!

691
01:36:03,398 --> 01:36:06,674
- I will not forget that
- I hope so

692
01:36:07,158 --> 01:36:09,194
Oh my God, will pay a price

693
01:36:16,518 --> 01:36:22,912
You do not say you may have grown with the Negro?

694
01:36:25,278 --> 01:36:27,917
Yes

695
01:36:30,598 --> 01:36:32,190
I did

696
01:36:34,478 --> 01:36:36,116
Oh my God

697
01:37:52,278 --> 01:37:54,189
Li did not come unfiltered, dear?

698
01:37:58,958 --> 01:38:01,313
Stotiny disease, which is today?

699
01:38:01,878 --> 01:38:03,630
Anything you want, dear

700
01:38:11,318 --> 01:38:13,468
One of them in a hurry!

701
01:38:28,758 --> 01:38:31,750
It is! Omeskuh!

702
01:38:38,958 --> 01:38:40,232
He was there!

703
01:38:57,478 --> 01:38:59,514
Become aware of, there is no way out of here

704
01:39:28,158 --> 01:39:30,752
Toko! Please that under my authority
I know what to do!

705
01:39:35,158 --> 01:39:37,149
He must have the boat!

706
01:41:19,638 --> 01:41:24,712
Toko Gold, died Toko

707
01:41:52,038 --> 01:41:53,710
Do you say to them?

708
01:41:55,158 --> 01:41:56,716
I tell them why?

709
01:41:59,758 --> 01:42:02,147
You are not the father of this child

710
01:42:03,278 --> 01:42:06,554
I can not, it's the only way to protect us

711
01:42:09,798 --> 01:42:13,313
Dwarf child would not differentiate them in something
As for my child, this is different

712
01:42:14,158 --> 01:42:15,876
Sithmonak rape

713
01:42:17,078 --> 01:42:20,468
- Sidonk imprisonment

714
01:42:22,558 --> 01:42:24,355
Ark Sielenoa public

715
01:42:25,478 --> 01:42:29,107
- Sinfonk of your country

716
01:42:40,118 --> 01:42:46,273
Mr. Toko Ambaky
Born in the twenty-sixth of October 1850 ....

717
01:42:46,518 --> 01:42:51,467
In the state of the Ubangui
The artist and his circus

718
01:42:51,958 --> 01:42:56,474
Under the command of King Seko Matiko
Is this true?

719
01:43:00,718 --> 01:43:04,313
After deliberating in the Royal Court ......

720
01:43:04,718 --> 01:43:10,827
The body will be confiscated and given to the Academy
Ownership of the research

721
01:43:12,838 --> 01:43:14,556
Is Toukain here, please?

722
01:43:30,878 --> 01:43:32,755
Please get out of the body

723
01:44:03,158 --> 01:44:04,352
Are you okay?

724
01:44:05,278 --> 01:44:06,393
Kdhuha home

725
01:44:07,038 --> 01:44:09,711
Must go to the Academy
Solhak you later

726
01:44:09,958 --> 01:44:11,710
ZACHARIE, stay with them

727
01:44:23,478 --> 01:44:24,911
I know .....

728
01:44:28,998 --> 01:44:32,035
Madam, I beg you
Taataamly not with this man

729
01:44:32,198 --> 01:44:35,270
- Like others will Ejnk
- Aturkna alone, Mr. McBride

730
01:44:35,678 --> 01:44:39,751
I must be the agent
It must Ahmiaa

731
01:44:40,038 --> 01:44:41,596
Get out of here!

732
01:44:43,718 --> 01:44:45,151
This monster of a man!

733
01:44:47,478 --> 01:44:49,787
The whole world should know
Within the scope of the evil of this man!

734
01:44:52,638 --> 01:44:54,708
We have destroyed everything!

735
01:45:25,758 --> 01:45:29,387
I have come here today to speak on one thing only

736
01:45:30,558 --> 01:45:32,230
Douglas killing

737
01:45:33,278 --> 01:45:37,157
Everyone knows the fact that the killer is female barbarism

738
01:45:38,198 --> 01:45:40,553
This is the proper recognition of the issue

739
01:45:46,998 --> 01:45:49,148
Barbarism will be the death penalty ....

740
01:45:50,318 --> 01:45:56,154
And the embryo, which will be unsustainable for the Scientific Study

741
01:45:58,078 --> 01:45:59,557
And what is needed? 

742
01:46:08,038 --> 01:46:12,429
The brother of Egypt to prove your results

743
01:46:15,558 --> 01:46:20,871
He wants to recognize you manipulating the Pygmies

744
01:46:23,038 --> 01:46:27,748
And that falls on you all the intelligence and Alasanip

745
01:46:29,118 --> 01:46:33,430
That you did this, it will not Nlahakkm on this issue in the judiciary

746
01:47:16,998 --> 01:47:18,477
Mr. McBride?

747
01:47:48,678 --> 01:47:52,227
And please Tell Freiser that our friend
A happy life to enjoy

748
01:47:53,398 --> 01:47:57,152
To become the agent of the people
Who I know well

749
01:47:58,718 --> 01:48:03,633
I feared and proved, and their hopes and dreams ...

750
01:48:04,078 --> 01:48:06,911
And this without any word between us

751
01:48:07,758 --> 01:48:10,192
ZACHARIE was in constant fear this trip ...

752
01:48:10,558 --> 01:48:14,153
And concern about the tribesmen
And what they will do, who knew that ....

753
01:48:14,398 --> 01:48:18,755
Simply travel accompanied Gazzmp
So we were working undercover

754
01:48:42,438 --> 01:48:47,671
Union agent slowly increasing
This uncertainty is a given?

755
01:49:05,838 --> 01:49:07,351
Mr. McBride ....

756
01:49:13,838 --> 01:49:15,476
I shall revert back to Africa

757
01:49:16,598 --> 01:49:20,477
It must be the place where I would be ....
That my heart there is

758
01:49:21,238 --> 01:49:26,073
And is likely to see Dr. Dodd
Jimmy ....

759
01:49:28,518 --> 01:49:32,830
Is there anything he wants me to say?

760
01:49:34,718 --> 01:49:37,676
Yes, Jaime ....

761
01:49:43,918 --> 01:49:45,749
Goodbye, Mr. McBride

762
01:49:48,678 --> 01:49:50,396
I am very sorry

763
01:50:13,238 --> 01:50:16,036
Tell them to pay, ZACHARIE
The original breathing

764
01:50:18,838 --> 01:50:21,511
Pay reparations .... Yes .....

765
01:50:26,918 --> 01:50:29,955
I can see your child
Pay reparations!

766
01:51:25,438 --> 01:51:27,747
I wanted to enter the forest with ...

767
01:51:27,918 --> 01:51:31,194
Ohmiaa and is for the child ...

768
01:51:32,238 --> 01:51:35,787
, But it made me understand that the journey has ended

769
01:51:36,678 --> 01:51:41,672
There, at the borders of its territory, the world

770
01:52:28,278 --> 01:52:29,870
Toko when he died ....

771
01:52:30,318 --> 01:52:34,197
I grabbed another and kept the rest in the hands of breath

772
01:52:35,238 --> 01:52:38,514
It is usually between some African tribes

773
01:52:39,558 --> 01:52:42,630
They believe that it is the same .... grabbed another

774
01:52:43,278 --> 01:52:49,308
This person will carry the spirit of the Dead with him forever .....

775
01:52:56,798 --> 01:53:00,757
