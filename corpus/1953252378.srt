1
00:00:57,256 --> 00:01:00,158
We begin tonight with
an environmental mystery.

2
00:01:00,159 --> 00:01:02,326
...debris along the beach
as far as the eye can see.

3
00:01:03,864 --> 00:01:05,863
A large fish kill has struck

4
00:01:05,864 --> 00:01:08,265
along the shoreline of the
Sebastian Inlet State Park.

5
00:01:08,266 --> 00:01:09,566
Biologists tell us there
were up to a million...

6
00:01:09,567 --> 00:01:11,268
She captured reams of dead fish

7
00:01:11,269 --> 00:01:12,403
rolling onshore
and piling up...

8
00:01:12,404 --> 00:01:14,538
Fishery staff are
baffled at what caused

9
00:01:14,539 --> 00:01:15,840
these hundreds of dead fish...

10
00:01:15,841 --> 00:01:18,176
Up to 5,000 blackbirds

11
00:01:18,177 --> 00:01:20,678
fell within
a one-mile area...

12
00:01:20,679 --> 00:01:23,414
Roughly two million...

13
00:01:23,415 --> 00:01:25,718
Dead fish on the shores
of Rio de Janeiro...

14
00:01:25,719 --> 00:01:28,353
Two million fish
here along Chesapeake Bay...

15
00:01:28,354 --> 00:01:31,256
Thousands of birds started
falling from the sky...

16
00:01:35,593 --> 00:01:38,263
...investigation
is ongoing...

17
00:01:38,264 --> 00:01:39,496
They got me up 4:00
in the morning,

18
00:01:39,497 --> 00:01:41,265
told me we had birds
falling out of the sky.

19
00:01:41,266 --> 00:01:43,746
Scientists don't
know what killed them.

20
00:01:53,746 --> 00:01:55,445
To your left...

21
00:01:55,446 --> 00:01:56,815
look over to your left.

22
00:01:56,816 --> 00:01:59,417
Okay, you can see
that's where the footage

23
00:01:59,418 --> 00:02:02,220
about where you can,
uh, address...

24
00:02:02,221 --> 00:02:04,590
- what that was about, okay?
- Okay, sounds good.

25
00:02:04,591 --> 00:02:08,226
Okay, why don't we start off?
If you could just

26
00:02:08,227 --> 00:02:09,662
fill us in
with basic details...

27
00:02:09,663 --> 00:02:11,666
Okay.

28
00:02:13,666 --> 00:02:17,234
Uh, my name is Donna Thompson.

29
00:02:17,235 --> 00:02:19,436
I was a Communications major

30
00:02:19,437 --> 00:02:21,439
at American University

31
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,907
covering the July 4th
festivities

32
00:02:23,908 --> 00:02:27,679
in Claridge, Maryland,
on July 4th, 2009.

33
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,614
No cam... hey.

34
00:02:29,615 --> 00:02:32,216
This is the first time
I am speaking publicly

35
00:02:32,217 --> 00:02:33,919
about the disaster
that happened.

36
00:02:35,821 --> 00:02:38,222
I was there.

37
00:02:38,223 --> 00:02:40,759
Let's follow it.

38
00:02:45,598 --> 00:02:47,899
You okay, Donna?

39
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:50,702
Donna?

40
00:02:50,703 --> 00:02:52,737
- Yeah.
- Okay?

41
00:02:52,738 --> 00:02:55,273
- Are we gonna be all right?
- Yeah, I'm sorry.

42
00:02:55,274 --> 00:02:57,378
I thought this was gonna be
a little easier to talk about.

43
00:03:00,378 --> 00:03:02,615
Okay, tell me when
you're ready and, um,

44
00:03:02,616 --> 00:03:04,415
you can continue.

45
00:03:04,416 --> 00:03:06,652
- Okay.
- I know it's hard. Go ahead.

46
00:03:07,652 --> 00:03:10,354
Um...

47
00:03:10,355 --> 00:03:12,790
my name is Donna Thompson.

48
00:03:12,791 --> 00:03:15,027
For three years,
I and a few others

49
00:03:16,027 --> 00:03:18,596
have been trying to speak out
about what happened

50
00:03:18,597 --> 00:03:19,897
in Claridge, Maryland,

51
00:03:20,032 --> 00:03:22,767
on July 4th, 2009.

52
00:03:22,768 --> 00:03:26,404
But sometimes words
have no impact.

53
00:03:26,405 --> 00:03:29,274
But now, with the help
of a website

54
00:03:29,275 --> 00:03:30,709
called GovLeaks.org,

55
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:32,845
all of the digital information

56
00:03:32,846 --> 00:03:35,715
that was recorded that day
has been obtained.

57
00:03:36,715 --> 00:03:39,616
All of the digital information
that was confiscated.

58
00:03:39,617 --> 00:03:42,787
Now, I don't know if anyone

59
00:03:42,788 --> 00:03:44,621
is gonna be watching this.

60
00:03:44,622 --> 00:03:46,990
I don't know if anything
is gonna happen to me

61
00:03:46,991 --> 00:03:49,661
as a result of me
putting this out there,

62
00:03:49,662 --> 00:03:52,363
but I do know that

63
00:03:52,364 --> 00:03:55,001
I can't move on with my life

64
00:03:56,001 --> 00:03:58,506
until this story is told.

65
00:04:00,506 --> 00:04:02,774
You know, it's just, um...

66
00:04:02,775 --> 00:04:05,776
it's hard to explain
what this town used to be like.

67
00:04:05,777 --> 00:04:07,644
Well, it's 6:00
in the morning

68
00:04:07,645 --> 00:04:10,481
with "Mike in the Morning"
on this beautiful day,

69
00:04:10,482 --> 00:04:11,817
this Day of Independence.

70
00:04:11,818 --> 00:04:14,786
Good morning, Chesapeake,
and good morning, America.

71
00:04:14,787 --> 00:04:17,086
Listen, I'm your marathon man.

72
00:04:17,087 --> 00:04:18,755
What does that mean?

73
00:04:18,756 --> 00:04:20,692
Hopefully you're gonna be
with me day and night

74
00:04:20,693 --> 00:04:22,760
as I am with you
and we can celebrate.

75
00:04:22,761 --> 00:04:24,663
I can't think
of a better way to celebrate

76
00:04:24,664 --> 00:04:26,731
than a little music
from the heartland.

77
00:04:26,732 --> 00:04:29,900
I used to
come here every summer

78
00:04:29,901 --> 00:04:31,768
with my folks.

79
00:04:31,769 --> 00:04:34,638
It's hard to explain what
this town used to be like.

80
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:36,708
I mean, it was fun.

81
00:04:36,709 --> 00:04:40,111
It was where I had
my first crab dinner,

82
00:04:40,112 --> 00:04:41,482
my first summer kiss.

83
00:04:43,482 --> 00:04:46,116
So, uh, that's the mayor
right there.

84
00:04:46,117 --> 00:04:47,885
Mayor John Stockman.

85
00:04:47,886 --> 00:04:50,520
He actually used to run
a vacuum cleaner shop,

86
00:04:50,521 --> 00:04:52,622
and then one day he just
up and got everyone

87
00:04:52,623 --> 00:04:53,494
to vote for him for mayor.

88
00:04:55,494 --> 00:04:58,595
Right there, that's Martin
and Helen Wycoff.

89
00:04:58,596 --> 00:05:01,567
They were both involved in a lot
of community service programs.

90
00:05:01,568 --> 00:05:05,703
Um, their whole family
actually died that day.

91
00:05:05,704 --> 00:05:07,705
Three, two, one.

92
00:05:07,706 --> 00:05:09,142
Good morning, Maryland.

93
00:05:11,142 --> 00:05:14,511
- Oh, wait. Sorry.
- It's okay.

94
00:05:14,512 --> 00:05:16,714
Honestly,
why didn't anyone tell me

95
00:05:16,715 --> 00:05:18,683
my pants were too tight?

96
00:05:18,684 --> 00:05:21,852
I'm sorry. It's just that every
time I look at this footage,

97
00:05:21,853 --> 00:05:23,754
it's...

98
00:05:23,755 --> 00:05:26,424
it's a little difficult,
and I have this tendency

99
00:05:26,425 --> 00:05:28,458
to overcompensate a little bit.

100
00:05:28,459 --> 00:05:32,696
- So...
- So you use humor, uh,

101
00:05:32,697 --> 00:05:34,799
to hide those emotions.

102
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,100
- I understand.
- Right.

103
00:05:37,101 --> 00:05:38,637
I mean, maybe
you should've gotten

104
00:05:38,638 --> 00:05:40,772
a voice actor
or something to do this.

105
00:05:40,773 --> 00:05:42,107
I don't know.

106
00:05:42,108 --> 00:05:43,641
Okay, okay.
I gotta stop this.

107
00:05:43,642 --> 00:05:45,643
I've been getting
too many phone calls,

108
00:05:45,644 --> 00:05:46,777
too many complaints.

109
00:05:46,778 --> 00:05:48,747
For those of you who do care,

110
00:05:48,748 --> 00:05:50,481
it is Aaron Copland.

111
00:05:50,482 --> 00:05:52,150
That's a piece
from "Our Town."

112
00:05:52,151 --> 00:05:54,719
What do you say we kick
the energy up a little bit, huh?

113
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,788
I was just a summer intern.

114
00:05:56,789 --> 00:05:59,657
I was just so excited
I was gonna be

115
00:05:59,658 --> 00:06:02,092
actually interviewing people.

116
00:06:02,093 --> 00:06:04,029
I think it's every girl's dream
to be Miss Crustacean.

117
00:06:05,029 --> 00:06:07,765
I hope it's the beginning
of something much, much bigger.

118
00:06:07,766 --> 00:06:10,066
I want to thank my parents
for their support

119
00:06:10,067 --> 00:06:13,070
and my sister Taylor
for always being there for me.

120
00:06:13,071 --> 00:06:15,672
Good morning, Maryland.

121
00:06:15,673 --> 00:06:18,809
This is Donna Thompson,
and I'm in Claridge, Maryland.

122
00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:20,678
Claridge is the host
of our annual

123
00:06:20,679 --> 00:06:22,946
Eastern Chesapeake
July 4th party.

124
00:06:22,947 --> 00:06:25,216
And I will be here all day
to cover the events.

125
00:06:25,217 --> 00:06:28,719
It is my great pleasure
to announce

126
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:32,924
the beginning
of the 57th Annual

127
00:06:32,925 --> 00:06:36,594
Claridge Crab Eating
Spectacular.

128
00:06:38,130 --> 00:06:39,067
Am I in the frame?

129
00:06:42,067 --> 00:06:45,169
So, this is good old Claridge.

130
00:06:45,170 --> 00:06:48,205
It was founded in 1903,

131
00:06:48,206 --> 00:06:50,775
supposedly by a fisherman
who ran around here

132
00:06:50,776 --> 00:06:53,611
and liked it so much that
he started a crab restaurant.

133
00:06:53,612 --> 00:06:55,479
- What's your name?
- Tyler.

134
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:57,615
And have you been preparing
for a while for this?

135
00:06:57,616 --> 00:06:58,915
Not very.

136
00:06:58,916 --> 00:07:01,652
All of it is, or was,

137
00:07:01,653 --> 00:07:04,023
a whole population of 6,200.

138
00:07:05,023 --> 00:07:06,959
There's a pretty big
chicken industry,

139
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,693
a bunch of restaurants,

140
00:07:08,694 --> 00:07:11,528
and a whole lot of money
is made from summer tourism

141
00:07:11,529 --> 00:07:12,865
on the water here.

142
00:07:14,533 --> 00:07:17,635
Good job! Who's next?
Who's next?

143
00:07:17,636 --> 00:07:20,642
- Me! Me! Me!
- I wanna get dunked.

144
00:07:23,642 --> 00:07:26,777
♪ Who's been playin'
around with you? ♪

145
00:07:26,778 --> 00:07:29,750
♪ A real cool cat
with eyes of blue... ♪

146
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:34,585
Oh, God. This
is my first interview ever

147
00:07:34,586 --> 00:07:36,254
with Mayor Stockman.

148
00:07:36,255 --> 00:07:39,556
I think I made him do this interview
like four different times.

149
00:07:39,557 --> 00:07:41,625
I think I even told him
his hair dried fast

150
00:07:41,626 --> 00:07:42,928
because he's bald.

151
00:07:42,929 --> 00:07:46,063
Yep, it does dry fast, yeah.

152
00:07:46,064 --> 00:07:48,665
So, I think we can show
just about everybody

153
00:07:48,666 --> 00:07:51,035
that comes on down
a really good time.

154
00:07:51,036 --> 00:07:53,270
Yeah. Cool.

155
00:07:53,271 --> 00:07:54,307
Of course, at the time,

156
00:07:54,308 --> 00:07:56,974
I had no idea
how culpable he was

157
00:07:56,975 --> 00:07:58,742
for what was about to happen.

158
00:08:03,214 --> 00:08:05,950
The first signs
that something was very wrong

159
00:08:05,951 --> 00:08:09,119
happened six weeks
before July 4th.

160
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,789
It was on the news,
but I don't think anybody

161
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:13,091
really put two and two together

162
00:08:13,092 --> 00:08:15,660
and knew what was going on.

163
00:08:15,661 --> 00:08:17,694
The bodies of
two scientists were found

164
00:08:17,695 --> 00:08:19,665
in the Chesapeake Bay
last night after having been

165
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:22,165
reported missing
for more than 36 hours.

166
00:08:22,166 --> 00:08:24,835
The cause of death
was listed as unknown,

167
00:08:24,836 --> 00:08:27,672
although medical examiners found
numerous wounds on the body

168
00:08:27,673 --> 00:08:29,873
that might be consistent
with shark bites.

169
00:08:29,874 --> 00:08:31,810
The two scientists
were oceanographers

170
00:08:31,811 --> 00:08:35,245
working to measure
pollution levels in the bay.

171
00:08:35,246 --> 00:08:37,915
These were two oceanographers.

172
00:08:37,916 --> 00:08:40,350
One from the Cousteau Institute

173
00:08:40,351 --> 00:08:43,254
and another from
the University of Maryland.

174
00:08:43,255 --> 00:08:46,290
They were keeping a video diary
of their research

175
00:08:46,291 --> 00:08:50,061
and sending it to the Chesapeake
Environmental Council.

176
00:08:50,062 --> 00:08:53,797
Red algae here and here

177
00:08:53,798 --> 00:08:55,000
does indicate bacterial growth.

178
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,868
Now Natural Resources,

179
00:08:57,869 --> 00:09:00,172
they think it's feeding off
the nutrients in the water

180
00:09:00,173 --> 00:09:02,105
from the chicken runoff.

181
00:09:02,106 --> 00:09:04,108
- That's a strange attack.
- Yes, it is.

182
00:09:04,109 --> 00:09:06,676
You don't hear about shark
attacks in the bay, normally.

183
00:09:06,677 --> 00:09:08,744
Well, I think bull
sharks can be aggressive.

184
00:09:08,745 --> 00:09:10,081
It seems like I remember, what,

185
00:09:10,082 --> 00:09:12,782
- a couple of attacks last year, maybe?
- Here and there.

186
00:09:12,783 --> 00:09:15,084
- Yeah.
- It is brackish throughout the Chesapeake Bay

187
00:09:15,085 --> 00:09:16,652
and bull sharks have been known

188
00:09:16,653 --> 00:09:18,123
to come up
in the bay occasionally.

189
00:09:18,124 --> 00:09:20,925
I gotta tell ya.
It makes me a little nervous.

190
00:09:20,926 --> 00:09:24,362
We have a boat and go out
in the bay all the time.

191
00:09:24,363 --> 00:09:26,998
They got the results
on the water analysis.

192
00:09:26,999 --> 00:09:28,835
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

193
00:09:29,835 --> 00:09:31,735
What do you have?

194
00:09:31,736 --> 00:09:33,838
Uh, mercury levels
way above standards,

195
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:36,106
polycyclic acids, OPs,

196
00:09:36,107 --> 00:09:38,843
PCBs that haven't
been legal in 20 years.

197
00:09:38,844 --> 00:09:41,879
Endocrine disruptors, pharmaceuticals,

198
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:44,080
Viagra, estrogen, DDT,

199
00:09:44,081 --> 00:09:45,851
- trace amounts of GRDF.
- Phew.

200
00:09:45,852 --> 00:09:48,686
I mean, pretty much
you name it,

201
00:09:48,687 --> 00:09:50,360
it's in there.

202
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:57,231
I mean, looky here.

203
00:10:00,231 --> 00:10:02,199
Naw.

204
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:04,734
This whole stream
of toxin is following the current.

205
00:10:04,735 --> 00:10:06,303
The what's following the what?

206
00:10:06,304 --> 00:10:08,973
- You have a very thick accent sometimes.
- Sam.

207
00:10:08,974 --> 00:10:12,976
This whole stream of toxin
is following the current.

208
00:10:12,977 --> 00:10:15,179
- Yes.
- Look. It's going next to this little town.

209
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:16,681
Claridge.

210
00:10:16,682 --> 00:10:19,350
Claridge.

211
00:10:19,351 --> 00:10:21,818
There were
people who were concerned

212
00:10:21,819 --> 00:10:23,121
about what was going on
in the bay.

213
00:10:23,122 --> 00:10:26,190
With some of the townsfolk,
it did cause arguments.

214
00:10:26,191 --> 00:10:29,826
Your chicken plants are putting
chicken shit in my bay...

215
00:10:29,827 --> 00:10:30,995
...and they're killing.

216
00:10:30,996 --> 00:10:32,863
The important thing, Jerry...

217
00:10:32,864 --> 00:10:35,331
Jerry? The important
thing to understand

218
00:10:35,332 --> 00:10:38,835
is that the EPA continues
to test the bay.

219
00:10:38,836 --> 00:10:40,471
And it is really...

220
00:10:40,472 --> 00:10:43,712
it's really their responsibility.
It's their responsibility.

221
00:10:47,712 --> 00:10:49,779
Each one of these sheds has

222
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:53,149
approximately 32,000
chickens in it each.

223
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:56,854
Those chickens eat about
10,000 pounds worth of food.

224
00:10:56,855 --> 00:10:59,856
They do this all
very mathematically.

225
00:10:59,857 --> 00:11:02,726
You know, I don't care what
people say about the bay.

226
00:11:02,727 --> 00:11:03,794
I know it looks
a little different,

227
00:11:03,795 --> 00:11:06,763
but all our kids have grown up

228
00:11:06,764 --> 00:11:08,398
in the water in the bay.

229
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:09,900
So I don't know what all
the doom and gloom

230
00:11:09,901 --> 00:11:11,802
is all about.

231
00:11:11,803 --> 00:11:14,005
There's 45 million
pounds of chicken shit

232
00:11:15,005 --> 00:11:16,875
dumped into the bay each year.

233
00:11:16,876 --> 00:11:18,475
I mean, look at that.

234
00:11:18,476 --> 00:11:21,811
That is entirely chicken shit.

235
00:11:21,812 --> 00:11:24,114
And over here.

236
00:11:24,115 --> 00:11:26,517
Look how close we are
to the water.

237
00:11:26,518 --> 00:11:28,753
It's right there.

238
00:11:28,754 --> 00:11:32,455
Chicken shit.
Water.

239
00:11:32,456 --> 00:11:34,326
We gotta have
improvement in the economy.

240
00:11:34,327 --> 00:11:35,893
We got to develop.

241
00:11:35,894 --> 00:11:37,794
I say we develop
the hell out of the bay.

242
00:11:37,795 --> 00:11:39,362
And then we can pay
to clean it up.

243
00:11:40,766 --> 00:11:42,800
You know, a lot of people...

244
00:11:42,801 --> 00:11:45,135
a lot of people...
gave me a hard time

245
00:11:45,136 --> 00:11:47,238
when we put up
the desalination plant.

246
00:11:47,239 --> 00:11:49,205
With that desalination plant,

247
00:11:49,206 --> 00:11:51,242
we increased the capacity

248
00:11:51,243 --> 00:11:53,177
for poultry farming
in the area.

249
00:11:53,178 --> 00:11:55,044
The desalination plant

250
00:11:55,045 --> 00:11:56,014
filtered water from the bay

251
00:11:57,014 --> 00:11:58,783
so that people could drink it

252
00:11:58,784 --> 00:12:00,951
and use it
for the chicken industry.

253
00:12:00,952 --> 00:12:02,920
And everyone just assumed

254
00:12:02,921 --> 00:12:05,790
it would take anything
harmful out of the water.

255
00:12:05,791 --> 00:12:07,957
Your lawns benefit from that.

256
00:12:07,958 --> 00:12:10,393
We have pools
that are in operation.

257
00:12:10,394 --> 00:12:12,463
And last but not least,

258
00:12:12,464 --> 00:12:14,330
I don't know about you,

259
00:12:14,331 --> 00:12:17,935
but I think this is
the best darn water

260
00:12:17,936 --> 00:12:19,369
I've ever tasted.

261
00:12:22,874 --> 00:12:25,842
People were worried
about the economy and the water,

262
00:12:25,843 --> 00:12:27,812
but mostly that
wasn't their focus.

263
00:12:27,813 --> 00:12:30,880
They were just doing
the American thing.

264
00:12:30,881 --> 00:12:32,817
You know, trying
to make a living,

265
00:12:32,818 --> 00:12:35,585
dealing with their children,
enjoying their lives.

266
00:12:35,586 --> 00:12:37,588
And everything seemed

267
00:12:37,589 --> 00:12:39,360
really pretty good.

268
00:12:48,567 --> 00:12:50,301
Someone do something.

269
00:12:50,302 --> 00:12:51,003
Do something!

270
00:12:54,905 --> 00:12:57,106
What's going on?

271
00:12:57,107 --> 00:12:58,508
Mommy!

272
00:13:02,547 --> 00:13:04,318
- What's going on?
- What happened?

273
00:13:07,318 --> 00:13:09,385
Oh, my God.

274
00:13:09,386 --> 00:13:11,354
Has anyone seen my husband?

275
00:13:11,355 --> 00:13:13,224
What's happening to me?

276
00:13:13,225 --> 00:13:14,925
Please help me.

277
00:13:14,926 --> 00:13:16,627
I need my husband

278
00:13:16,628 --> 00:13:18,461
and my kids.

279
00:13:18,462 --> 00:13:20,464
I need to go to the hospital.

280
00:13:20,465 --> 00:13:23,267
Someone needs to get me
to the hospital.

281
00:13:23,268 --> 00:13:25,035
Almost done.
We should have a report

282
00:13:25,036 --> 00:13:27,238
of who the winner is shortly.

283
00:13:27,239 --> 00:13:29,239
I need to go to the hospital.

284
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:32,109
Someone needs to get me
to the hospital.

285
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:35,048
I've never seen
anything like that.

286
00:13:39,583 --> 00:13:40,585
Ohh.

287
00:13:40,586 --> 00:13:42,585
Ooh, are you getting that?
Are you getting that?

288
00:13:42,586 --> 00:13:44,288
He just vomited.
Are you getting that?

289
00:13:46,490 --> 00:13:48,264
Oh, my gosh. Oh, my God.

290
00:13:52,264 --> 00:13:55,199
It's okay... miss, cut
the cameras, please.

291
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,606
It's all right, Tiffany. You're
almost done, sweetheart.

292
00:14:02,606 --> 00:14:04,274
Danny, where are you?

293
00:14:04,275 --> 00:14:05,576
This is a lens cap?

294
00:14:05,577 --> 00:14:08,278
- Am I in frame?
- Mm.

295
00:14:08,279 --> 00:14:10,580
This is Dr. Jack Abrams.

296
00:14:10,581 --> 00:14:14,518
He was the head physician
in the emergency waiting room

297
00:14:14,519 --> 00:14:16,686
at Atlantic Hospital.

298
00:14:16,687 --> 00:14:20,624
He would actually end up
treating over 350 patients

299
00:14:20,625 --> 00:14:22,558
over the course of that day.

300
00:14:22,559 --> 00:14:26,229
And he would die
later that night.

301
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:27,974
Could you take
off your shirt, please?

302
00:14:35,974 --> 00:14:38,043
Just... can you... turn around
a little bit more?

303
00:14:38,044 --> 00:14:40,043
I'm just gonna point
this out to the camera.

304
00:14:40,044 --> 00:14:42,211
CDC. Is this an emergency?

305
00:14:42,212 --> 00:14:44,249
- Yes, it is.
- Are you a health professional?

306
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:47,183
- A doctor.
- Okay. Hold, please.

307
00:14:47,184 --> 00:14:48,019
- Emergency operations.
- Yeah, hi.

308
00:14:49,019 --> 00:14:50,455
This is Dr. Jack Abrams
over at the Atlantic Hospital

309
00:14:50,456 --> 00:14:52,556
in Claridge, Maryland.

310
00:14:52,557 --> 00:14:56,562
- How can we help you today?
- We're in the middle of some kind of bacterial outbreak.

311
00:14:58,562 --> 00:15:00,730
This is Dr. Williams
in Communicable Disease.

312
00:15:00,731 --> 00:15:02,966
Uh, you believe you may
have a bacterial case?

313
00:15:02,967 --> 00:15:05,369
Uh, not one. 30.

314
00:15:05,370 --> 00:15:06,670
What?

315
00:15:06,671 --> 00:15:09,072
I got 30 people
in the waiting room

316
00:15:09,073 --> 00:15:12,408
- at my hospital right now.
- What are the symptoms?

317
00:15:12,409 --> 00:15:15,112
The entire group has broken out
in blisters, boils, lesions...

318
00:15:15,113 --> 00:15:19,249
- Where?
- Face, legs, neck, chest.

319
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:22,186
I got a woman whose entire
backside is covered in boils.

320
00:15:22,187 --> 00:15:25,455
- All right. When did this begin?
- This morning.

321
00:15:25,456 --> 00:15:27,523
Today.

322
00:15:27,524 --> 00:15:29,024
What do you think it is?

323
00:15:29,027 --> 00:15:30,594
I have no idea what it is.

324
00:15:30,595 --> 00:15:31,862
All right.

325
00:15:31,863 --> 00:15:34,565
I'm gonna walk you through a
list of associated symptoms.

326
00:15:34,566 --> 00:15:36,700
Okay.
Okay.

327
00:15:36,701 --> 00:15:38,370
I'm gonna ask you
a couple more questions.

328
00:15:38,371 --> 00:15:40,671
You been around any livestock?
Agriculture?

329
00:15:40,672 --> 00:15:42,306
- No.
- Farm animals?

330
00:15:42,307 --> 00:15:43,607
You spend a lot of time
in the sun?

331
00:15:43,608 --> 00:15:45,274
No, not really.

332
00:15:45,275 --> 00:15:46,711
More than usual?
Less than usual? Same?

333
00:15:46,712 --> 00:15:48,412
Not really.

334
00:15:48,413 --> 00:15:50,647
You know, it hurts

335
00:15:50,648 --> 00:15:51,981
just in my bones.

336
00:15:51,982 --> 00:15:54,551
What concerns me is we've had
a lot of people in today

337
00:15:54,552 --> 00:15:57,287
who've had similar
symptoms to that.

338
00:15:57,288 --> 00:15:59,623
Frankly, that's why
we're doing this.

339
00:15:59,624 --> 00:16:01,625
If you wouldn't mind just
looking right into the lens

340
00:16:01,626 --> 00:16:03,460
and saying your name?

341
00:16:03,461 --> 00:16:07,130
- My name is Lamya Jezek.
- Great.

342
00:16:07,131 --> 00:16:08,498
What am I supposed to say?

343
00:16:08,499 --> 00:16:09,601
Oh, no.
You're fine.

344
00:16:09,602 --> 00:16:11,701
I'm gonna ask you
a couple questions.

345
00:16:11,702 --> 00:16:12,836
Okay.

346
00:16:12,837 --> 00:16:14,704
I didn't know
it was a big deal.

347
00:16:14,705 --> 00:16:16,640
I'm just asking to go
through a drive-through.

348
00:16:16,641 --> 00:16:19,710
You're insane.
You do this every day.

349
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:21,178
- Okay, Grandma. Okay.
- It's like clockwork.

350
00:16:21,179 --> 00:16:23,714
I'm sorry. Grab the
food, you're out.

351
00:16:23,715 --> 00:16:25,215
That's why it's
a drive-through.

352
00:16:25,216 --> 00:16:27,383
It's not a big deal.
Just go through.

353
00:16:27,384 --> 00:16:28,685
Can you do it?

354
00:16:28,686 --> 00:16:30,587
This is Officer Paul.

355
00:16:30,588 --> 00:16:32,422
He's the one on the left.

356
00:16:32,423 --> 00:16:34,793
He was actually the best man
at Officer Jimson's wedding.

357
00:16:34,794 --> 00:16:36,793
What is that?

358
00:16:36,794 --> 00:16:40,330
- What is that?
- They reported the first death

359
00:16:40,331 --> 00:16:44,634
in Claridge
at 12:42 PM.

360
00:16:44,635 --> 00:16:47,771
Is he shot?

361
00:16:47,772 --> 00:16:49,605
Check his pulse.

362
00:16:49,606 --> 00:16:51,642
Oh, gosh.
I don't wanna do that.

363
00:16:54,446 --> 00:16:56,747
He's dead.

364
00:16:56,748 --> 00:16:59,682
I don't see any
bullet holes, though.

365
00:16:59,683 --> 00:17:02,485
All right. Central,
this is SM 10-12.

366
00:17:02,486 --> 00:17:03,554
We got a young white male

367
00:17:03,555 --> 00:17:05,655
laid out on the corner of, uh,

368
00:17:05,656 --> 00:17:07,624
Center and Hyde.

369
00:17:07,625 --> 00:17:09,293
He's dead.

370
00:17:09,294 --> 00:17:12,229
Go ahead and dispatch
EMS as soon as you can.

371
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:14,398
Is there anyone around?

372
00:17:25,742 --> 00:17:28,679
- Hi.
- Hey.

373
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:30,213
- Huh?
- Whoo.

374
00:17:30,214 --> 00:17:31,682
What do you think, Andrew?

375
00:17:31,683 --> 00:17:33,383
Oh, you like that foot.

376
00:17:33,384 --> 00:17:36,120
We're gonna go to Claridge,
see the fireworks, huh?

377
00:17:36,121 --> 00:17:37,821
Do you know what fireworks are?

378
00:17:37,822 --> 00:17:39,823
This is Alex

379
00:17:39,824 --> 00:17:42,326
and Stephanie Talmet.

380
00:17:42,327 --> 00:17:45,429
He was a very young,

381
00:17:45,430 --> 00:17:48,332
very successful dentist
from Townsend.

382
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:51,235
And Stephanie,
she grew up in Claridge

383
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:54,403
before becoming a big-shot
lawyer in Baltimore.

384
00:17:54,404 --> 00:17:56,404
We're gonna call them later
and they're gonna meet us there.

385
00:17:56,405 --> 00:17:59,208
- That's their baby.
- You sure? They're gonna meet us?

386
00:17:59,209 --> 00:18:01,679
They rented
a boat in Wilmington

387
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:04,614
to sail to Claridge
for the fireworks.

388
00:18:04,615 --> 00:18:06,050
And that's why they
were headed this way.

389
00:18:06,051 --> 00:18:09,519
All right. We're gonna
get this motorboat going.

390
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:10,920
We ready for this?

391
00:18:25,569 --> 00:18:27,637
Where are you, ma'am?

392
00:18:27,638 --> 00:18:29,739
My God. She's bleeding.

393
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:33,643
Ma'am?

394
00:18:33,644 --> 00:18:35,244
I just got my camera.

395
00:18:35,245 --> 00:18:36,713
She just ran out
into the yard, and...

396
00:18:36,714 --> 00:18:39,383
Can you tell me what
your address is right now?

397
00:18:39,384 --> 00:18:41,552
I'm in my home, I'm in my home.

398
00:18:41,553 --> 00:18:45,588
And what
street is your home on?

399
00:18:45,589 --> 00:18:48,725
She's bleeding. You
gotta send somebody, please.

400
00:18:48,726 --> 00:18:50,625
Where is she bleeding from?

401
00:18:50,626 --> 00:18:52,596
Just send help.
Send somebody now.

402
00:18:52,597 --> 00:18:54,765
Send somebody quick.
Please.

403
00:18:54,766 --> 00:18:57,304
114 Maple St.

404
00:19:00,771 --> 00:19:02,471
Donna? Donna?

405
00:19:02,472 --> 00:19:04,944
Hey, Donna.
Come here.

406
00:19:06,944 --> 00:19:09,313
Did anyone tell you
what this was?

407
00:19:09,314 --> 00:19:10,615
Do you know who's in there?

408
00:19:10,616 --> 00:19:12,883
All right.
Let's go.

409
00:19:12,884 --> 00:19:14,483
Let's follow it.

410
00:19:17,355 --> 00:19:19,659
Hey, we got a situation
over at the 9-1-1 Call Center.

411
00:19:21,659 --> 00:19:23,260
And the system's
about to go down.

412
00:19:23,261 --> 00:19:26,662
We're just overloaded
with calls.

413
00:19:26,663 --> 00:19:28,731
Atlantic Hospital's
overcrowded.

414
00:19:28,732 --> 00:19:31,468
75 at St. Alban's Clinic.

415
00:19:31,469 --> 00:19:34,738
Clinic on Dorsey? Check out all
those people out on the curb.

416
00:19:34,739 --> 00:19:36,906
Some sort of killer virus,
they say.

417
00:19:36,907 --> 00:19:40,243
You know?
So, wash your hands

418
00:19:40,244 --> 00:19:42,817
and keep your gloves on
and whatnot.

419
00:19:45,817 --> 00:19:49,685
I need you to
respond from the west side.

420
00:19:49,686 --> 00:19:52,288
Come up to Prince Street

421
00:19:52,289 --> 00:19:54,825
and stop short
of St. James

422
00:19:54,826 --> 00:19:58,629
and check back
to the south side.

423
00:19:58,630 --> 00:20:02,298
That's the one showing the body
was laying behind the yard.

424
00:20:02,299 --> 00:20:04,701
At the address
123 St. James.

425
00:20:04,702 --> 00:20:07,276
Hey, John.

426
00:20:11,276 --> 00:20:12,942
Whew. Marla Spatafora.

427
00:20:12,943 --> 00:20:14,645
She got it bad.

428
00:20:14,646 --> 00:20:17,381
I mean, somebody
really tore into her.

429
00:20:17,382 --> 00:20:20,786
Bill and I found her
over on the lawn.

430
00:20:21,786 --> 00:20:24,320
Her guts were tore out.

431
00:20:24,321 --> 00:20:26,823
- And her tongue cut off.
- Her tongue was cut off?

432
00:20:26,824 --> 00:20:28,691
Yeah.

433
00:20:28,692 --> 00:20:30,393
I imagine it's a domestic.

434
00:20:30,394 --> 00:20:31,695
Do we know anything
about the husband?

435
00:20:31,696 --> 00:20:33,430
A Jason Spatafora?

436
00:20:33,431 --> 00:20:35,365
I am at the scene
of the crime right now

437
00:20:35,366 --> 00:20:37,733
with a man named Jerry.

438
00:20:37,734 --> 00:20:39,536
He's a fisherman in the town.

439
00:20:39,537 --> 00:20:43,774
And, um, you knew
Ms. Sporafina, is that correct?

440
00:20:43,775 --> 00:20:45,675
Spatafora.

441
00:20:45,676 --> 00:20:47,044
I apologize.

442
00:20:47,045 --> 00:20:50,681
They... they sent us
the wrong name.

443
00:20:50,682 --> 00:20:54,383
She was a wonderful woman.
Very calm, very quiet.

444
00:20:54,384 --> 00:20:56,585
Does this go on
in the town a lot?

445
00:20:56,586 --> 00:20:58,654
Domestic violence cases?

446
00:20:58,655 --> 00:21:00,623
- It just seems...
- I'm sorry, what?

447
00:21:00,624 --> 00:21:02,993
Try it... do
that one more time.

448
00:21:02,994 --> 00:21:05,729
I thought I was
following a murder story.

449
00:21:05,730 --> 00:21:08,000
I was just going through
the motions,

450
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,433
almost trying to imitate
what I thought a reporter

451
00:21:11,434 --> 00:21:12,737
should sound like.

452
00:21:12,738 --> 00:21:14,740
No.

453
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:19,508
Makes me cringe
when I watch this now.

454
00:21:19,509 --> 00:21:22,781
- All right, just do an ending...
- God, I feel bad.

455
00:21:24,781 --> 00:21:26,516
I didn't seem too pushy, did I?

456
00:21:26,517 --> 00:21:27,555
No, no, no.

457
00:21:30,555 --> 00:21:31,623
I don't know.
It's weird.

458
00:21:31,624 --> 00:21:35,691
You have to, like, pretend
you don't feel anything

459
00:21:35,692 --> 00:21:37,662
about the situation
when you're a reporter.

460
00:21:37,663 --> 00:21:41,431
But it's...
no, you did a good job.

461
00:21:41,432 --> 00:21:43,798
You weren't overly emotional
and you weren't too...

462
00:21:43,799 --> 00:21:45,002
too much of a reporter
with him. It was good.

463
00:21:46,002 --> 00:21:48,407
- It was a good conversation.
- All right.

464
00:21:50,407 --> 00:21:52,808
Hey, hey.

465
00:21:52,809 --> 00:21:54,678
Are you excited?

466
00:21:54,679 --> 00:21:56,913
We're gonna go and
see Grandma and Grandpa.

467
00:21:56,914 --> 00:21:59,751
Yeah.

468
00:22:00,751 --> 00:22:03,386
Very exciting.

469
00:22:03,387 --> 00:22:06,789
You know what? We're not gonna say
anything about Grandma's hair.

470
00:22:06,790 --> 00:22:08,758
Where did he go?

471
00:22:08,759 --> 00:22:11,627
Where's Daddy?

472
00:22:11,628 --> 00:22:14,732
Oh, look at this.

473
00:22:15,732 --> 00:22:18,672
I need you to look
at this, okay?

474
00:22:21,672 --> 00:22:22,940
Just... just look at this.

475
00:22:22,941 --> 00:22:24,807
It's like some kind of

476
00:22:24,808 --> 00:22:26,476
blister or something.

477
00:22:26,477 --> 00:22:28,010
This girl... Jennifer...

478
00:22:28,011 --> 00:22:30,579
she was using FaceTime
with her phone

479
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:33,983
to show a rash that suddenly
broke out on her body.

480
00:22:33,984 --> 00:22:35,718
- This stuff on my arms...
- Oh, my God, Jennifer.

481
00:22:35,719 --> 00:22:36,988
- That's disgusting.
- Look at my leg.

482
00:22:36,989 --> 00:22:38,989
When we looked at
her phone call list,

483
00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:41,124
it turns out she was trying
to stay in contact

484
00:22:41,125 --> 00:22:43,460
with her friend
throughout the entire day.

485
00:22:43,461 --> 00:22:44,961
I can't get anyone
on the phone.

486
00:22:44,962 --> 00:22:46,929
- Did you put something on it?
- Nobody's answering.

487
00:22:46,930 --> 00:22:48,831
It just goes straight
to voicemail.

488
00:22:48,832 --> 00:22:50,601
I know. Service
is sucking ass.

489
00:22:50,602 --> 00:22:53,036
Every time I watch
these FaceTime videos,

490
00:22:53,037 --> 00:22:55,874
it makes me feel sad.

491
00:22:56,874 --> 00:22:59,508
My parents left
like an hour ago.

492
00:22:59,509 --> 00:23:00,910
I don't even know
where they were going.

493
00:23:00,911 --> 00:23:02,712
They didn't even tell me
they were leaving.

494
00:23:02,713 --> 00:23:04,547
They were just out the door

495
00:23:04,548 --> 00:23:06,116
and they pulled out
before I had a chance

496
00:23:06,117 --> 00:23:07,750
to even say goodbye

497
00:23:07,751 --> 00:23:09,686
or ask them where
they were going.

498
00:23:09,687 --> 00:23:12,758
- Does it hurt?
- Yeah, it does really hurt.

499
00:23:13,758 --> 00:23:15,090
Is this gonna be okay
for the audio?

500
00:23:15,091 --> 00:23:16,758
- Yeah.
- The rain on the...

501
00:23:16,759 --> 00:23:18,564
- I think it's okay.
- I'll speak loudly.

502
00:23:19,564 --> 00:23:21,864
Um, okay. Hello.

503
00:23:21,865 --> 00:23:23,933
That was very formal.

504
00:23:23,934 --> 00:23:27,470
Okay, we have now seen
one infected fish.

505
00:23:27,471 --> 00:23:28,540
And we are going
to be using this

506
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:32,776
borescope... hello...

507
00:23:32,777 --> 00:23:34,643
to go inside the fish's mouth

508
00:23:34,644 --> 00:23:36,482
and see if it was
an isolated incident or not.

509
00:23:38,482 --> 00:23:39,553
Come with me.

510
00:23:42,553 --> 00:23:43,757
Inside.

511
00:23:46,757 --> 00:23:48,829
Okay, secure.

512
00:23:52,829 --> 00:23:55,664
And okay.

513
00:23:55,665 --> 00:23:57,800
This, everyone,

514
00:23:57,801 --> 00:23:59,970
is parasite larvae.

515
00:23:59,971 --> 00:24:01,074
Ew.

516
00:24:03,074 --> 00:24:05,107
Explain for them.

517
00:24:05,108 --> 00:24:07,143
Uh, well,

518
00:24:07,144 --> 00:24:09,813
a parasite larvae,
it's, uh... it's a creature

519
00:24:09,814 --> 00:24:12,582
whose eggs are
swallowed by fish

520
00:24:12,583 --> 00:24:15,184
and then they hatch
inside the belly.

521
00:24:15,185 --> 00:24:16,952
It's fun stuff.

522
00:24:16,953 --> 00:24:19,256
I've never really seen
larvae like this, though.

523
00:24:19,257 --> 00:24:20,834
I don't know where
the parasites are coming from.

524
00:24:29,834 --> 00:24:31,134
What'd he say?

525
00:24:31,135 --> 00:24:32,768
I just heard on the car radio

526
00:24:32,769 --> 00:24:34,004
that there was another murder.

527
00:24:34,005 --> 00:24:36,072
- A second murder?
- Yes.

528
00:24:36,073 --> 00:24:37,774
Only 12 blocks from the murder

529
00:24:37,775 --> 00:24:39,741
of Marla Spatafora
this afternoon.

530
00:24:39,742 --> 00:24:41,112
And now authorities
are telling us

531
00:24:41,113 --> 00:24:42,711
the body was found in a rather

532
00:24:42,712 --> 00:24:44,314
mutilated condition.

533
00:24:44,315 --> 00:24:45,915
And I believe police believe

534
00:24:45,916 --> 00:24:47,783
that the husband could
be involved in this.

535
00:24:47,784 --> 00:24:49,084
That's what we're hearing.

536
00:24:49,085 --> 00:24:50,021
Some reports, perhaps,
of a history of abuse there.

537
00:24:51,021 --> 00:24:52,322
Or some allegations,
at least, of abuse.

538
00:24:52,323 --> 00:24:54,692
You can follow
her throughout the day

539
00:24:54,693 --> 00:24:59,796
by going to
www.wvbr33news.com.

540
00:24:59,797 --> 00:25:02,096
- Uh, sir. Channel 33...
- You are pushing your luck.

541
00:25:02,097 --> 00:25:03,832
This could be
a career-maker for her.

542
00:25:03,833 --> 00:25:05,700
- What are the odds?
- Unbelievable.

543
00:25:05,701 --> 00:25:07,603
- Unbelievable.
- Is she gonna be able to handle this?

544
00:25:07,604 --> 00:25:09,771
I just had to show you
these off-air comments.

545
00:25:09,772 --> 00:25:12,209
I mean, they're wondering
if I can handle this

546
00:25:12,210 --> 00:25:16,179
and they're right.
I'm chasing a murder mystery.

547
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:19,149
- A small town celebration.
- Yeah. We're gonna do the parade.

548
00:25:19,150 --> 00:25:22,085
- I'm from American University...
- You're out from college?

549
00:25:22,086 --> 00:25:24,153
That's it, guys.
Off the property.

550
00:25:24,154 --> 00:25:26,123
I wasn't asking
the right questions, and...

551
00:25:26,124 --> 00:25:29,593
Now she's covering what's gonna
be the biggest story of the year.

552
00:25:29,594 --> 00:25:30,692
It could be huge.
Could be huge.

553
00:25:30,693 --> 00:25:32,195
Sir, we do have press passes.

554
00:25:32,196 --> 00:25:34,698
- Press passes...
- Oh, my God.

555
00:25:34,699 --> 00:25:36,333
Oh, my God.

556
00:25:36,334 --> 00:25:38,267
Looking back,
I just don't understand

557
00:25:38,268 --> 00:25:40,635
how I still thought
it was a murder case.

558
00:25:40,636 --> 00:25:42,339
Jim, are you getting it?

559
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:44,374
I can only assume

560
00:25:44,375 --> 00:25:46,777
that whatever this is
is going to continue

561
00:25:46,778 --> 00:25:49,179
to eat away at the leg
and at the knee

562
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:50,881
and probably move
to the upper body

563
00:25:50,882 --> 00:25:52,615
and into the gonads.

564
00:25:52,616 --> 00:25:54,850
I think that what we're
talking about here

565
00:25:54,851 --> 00:25:57,222
are two separate strains
of some kind of parasite.

566
00:25:59,222 --> 00:26:01,758
Something that is
literally eating its way

567
00:26:01,759 --> 00:26:03,828
into the body from the outside.

568
00:26:04,828 --> 00:26:06,695
Uh, there are lesions

569
00:26:06,696 --> 00:26:08,632
and there's boils

570
00:26:08,633 --> 00:26:10,133
and also there's something

571
00:26:10,134 --> 00:26:13,169
eating its way out from inside.

572
00:26:13,170 --> 00:26:14,970
What I need you to do

573
00:26:14,971 --> 00:26:16,909
is figure out
what the hell this is.

574
00:26:18,909 --> 00:26:21,111
John, what is going on?

575
00:26:21,112 --> 00:26:22,777
Oh, man. You know...

576
00:26:22,778 --> 00:26:24,080
- We've never had murders...
- Well, you know...

577
00:26:24,081 --> 00:26:25,649
...reported here
in the city.

578
00:26:25,650 --> 00:26:27,250
You know, actually, um...

579
00:26:27,251 --> 00:26:29,085
I've been so busy

580
00:26:29,086 --> 00:26:31,354
with the reelection
and July 4th.

581
00:26:31,355 --> 00:26:33,123
I mean, the sheriff
office is...

582
00:26:33,124 --> 00:26:34,824
I've made contact with them.

583
00:26:34,825 --> 00:26:37,059
- It's not even labeled murder yet.
- Yeah.

584
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:38,029
- It isn't.
- Just an ongoing investigation.

585
00:26:39,029 --> 00:26:41,365
- It's a totally open investigation, yeah.
- Okay.

586
00:26:42,866 --> 00:26:44,300
All right, we're back.
It's "Radio on the Bay."

587
00:26:44,301 --> 00:26:45,802
George Khouri.

588
00:26:45,803 --> 00:26:47,403
Uh, we've got
our podcast 24-7,

589
00:26:47,404 --> 00:26:49,873
all the updates,
KhouriRadio.com.

590
00:26:49,874 --> 00:26:51,808
Right now we're just
gonna get right to it.

591
00:26:51,809 --> 00:26:54,044
We've got our esteemed
mayor, John Stockman.

592
00:26:54,045 --> 00:26:56,945
He's got a very important
announcement for the town,

593
00:26:56,946 --> 00:26:58,714
so right now we're just gonna

594
00:26:58,715 --> 00:27:00,114
turn it over to you,
Your Honor.

595
00:27:00,115 --> 00:27:01,382
Hey, Khouri.
Thanks so much.

596
00:27:01,383 --> 00:27:03,820
- I really appreciate this opportunity.
- Absolutely.

597
00:27:03,821 --> 00:27:07,891
There's a lot
of rumors being spread.

598
00:27:07,892 --> 00:27:10,294
And rumors can get you
into nothing but trouble,

599
00:27:10,295 --> 00:27:12,695
as we all know.
So, let me give you

600
00:27:12,696 --> 00:27:14,898
a little more clarity
as to what's going on.

601
00:27:14,899 --> 00:27:18,701
And we all know that
during warm weather

602
00:27:18,702 --> 00:27:20,236
bacteria levels can rise.

603
00:27:20,237 --> 00:27:23,472
And because of that,
sometimes there are those of us

604
00:27:23,473 --> 00:27:25,843
who pick up some kind
of digestive problems

605
00:27:25,844 --> 00:27:27,376
and sometimes rashes.

606
00:27:27,377 --> 00:27:30,747
It's unfortunate, but it's a
fact of life here on the bay.

607
00:27:30,748 --> 00:27:32,981
However...

608
00:27:32,982 --> 00:27:35,719
and I hope everyone
is paying attention to this...

609
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:38,320
let's not go around
scaring one another

610
00:27:38,321 --> 00:27:41,156
with crazy
and outlandish stories

611
00:27:41,157 --> 00:27:44,126
that serve no one's benefit.

612
00:27:44,127 --> 00:27:46,296
So, and I can't
stress this enough,

613
00:27:46,297 --> 00:27:49,798
if you have a sensitivity
to that type of bacteria,

614
00:27:49,799 --> 00:27:53,903
or if you just want
to take special precautions,

615
00:27:53,904 --> 00:27:56,039
you can limit your time
in the water today.

616
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:59,342
The bacteria level here
is much, much higher

617
00:27:59,343 --> 00:28:02,778
than even the high level
we see after a storm,

618
00:28:02,779 --> 00:28:04,514
and the fertilizer
from the farm

619
00:28:04,515 --> 00:28:06,849
- run into the water.
- You're rushing on the fertilizer.

620
00:28:06,850 --> 00:28:08,085
- Slow down on that.
- Okay.

621
00:28:08,086 --> 00:28:09,986
And the fertilizer
from the farm

622
00:28:09,987 --> 00:28:11,454
are running to the water.

623
00:28:11,455 --> 00:28:12,989
Um...

624
00:28:12,990 --> 00:28:15,158
It's, uh...
not good at all.

625
00:28:15,159 --> 00:28:17,760
It's very, very high.

626
00:28:17,761 --> 00:28:20,865
Yeah, that ending
is kind of sloppy on that.

627
00:28:21,865 --> 00:28:24,901
And if I have any information,

628
00:28:24,902 --> 00:28:26,003
and I do mean to stress this,

629
00:28:27,003 --> 00:28:29,905
if I have any information
that would alter those facts...

630
00:28:29,906 --> 00:28:31,441
and I say facts...

631
00:28:31,442 --> 00:28:35,178
I'll be right back here
talking to you again.

632
00:28:35,179 --> 00:28:37,180
And Khouri and everyone
out there,

633
00:28:37,181 --> 00:28:40,115
I just want to wish you
the happiest of 4th of Julys.

634
00:28:40,116 --> 00:28:41,056
Thanks again.

635
00:28:46,056 --> 00:28:48,124
There he is.

636
00:28:48,125 --> 00:28:49,992
- There he is.
- Oh, yeah!

637
00:28:49,993 --> 00:28:51,994
Who's buying dinner?

638
00:28:51,995 --> 00:28:53,461
Let's see it, let's see it.

639
00:28:53,462 --> 00:28:54,930
- Reel it in.
- There he is.

640
00:28:54,931 --> 00:28:57,332
That's so big, I don't
think he fits in this boat.

641
00:28:57,333 --> 00:28:58,566
Looks like he's trying to kiss you.

642
00:28:58,567 --> 00:29:00,005
There you go, huh? Nice.

643
00:29:01,005 --> 00:29:03,972
- That's not right, Danny.
- Look at that, Brad, huh?

644
00:29:03,973 --> 00:29:05,576
- That thing's huge.
- That's not right.

645
00:29:05,577 --> 00:29:08,044
It is right.
Look at that thing.

646
00:29:08,045 --> 00:29:09,547
Danny, you ever see
anything like that?

647
00:29:09,548 --> 00:29:11,847
What is that?

648
00:29:11,848 --> 00:29:13,248
- I've never seen nothing like that.
- What the heck is it?

649
00:29:13,249 --> 00:29:14,516
Ow! Son of a bitch!

650
00:29:14,517 --> 00:29:16,453
What the...

651
00:29:17,453 --> 00:29:18,822
Get it... get off of me!

652
00:29:18,823 --> 00:29:20,022
What is that?

653
00:29:20,023 --> 00:29:21,526
- Step back!
- Move away!

654
00:29:22,526 --> 00:29:24,161
That thing bit me.

655
00:29:24,162 --> 00:29:26,566
Holy shit, that thing is nasty.

656
00:29:28,566 --> 00:29:30,534
All right. Welcome back.
"Radio on the Bay."

657
00:29:30,535 --> 00:29:32,868
It's George Khouri.
We are live on the air,

658
00:29:32,869 --> 00:29:35,572
and of course 24-7,
we got our podcasts.

659
00:29:35,573 --> 00:29:38,141
You can grab 'em.
RadioKhouri.com.

660
00:29:38,142 --> 00:29:41,076
Now there's a lot of speculation,
a lot of phone calls coming in.

661
00:29:41,077 --> 00:29:43,546
People not quite sure
what to make of this,

662
00:29:43,547 --> 00:29:45,516
but theories do abound,
my friends.

663
00:29:45,517 --> 00:29:46,682
It's true.

664
00:29:46,683 --> 00:29:49,952
Maybe a satanic cult
has invaded the town.

665
00:29:49,953 --> 00:29:51,922
There's drugs loose in the air.

666
00:29:51,923 --> 00:29:54,025
We've got theories
running wild.

667
00:29:55,025 --> 00:29:57,927
I think it's al-Qaeda,
or whatever it's called.

668
00:29:57,928 --> 00:30:00,328
It's a terrorist plot
to poison the food supply.

669
00:30:00,329 --> 00:30:02,363
Gathering a lot of
information about the flu shots

670
00:30:02,364 --> 00:30:03,565
and the vaccines
and how they've caused...

671
00:30:03,566 --> 00:30:04,900
We've been warned
about pesticides.

672
00:30:04,901 --> 00:30:05,869
They're spraying all the food
with them these days.

673
00:30:05,870 --> 00:30:08,872
I saw this strange cloud.

674
00:30:08,873 --> 00:30:11,075
It was hovering over the water
down by the bay.

675
00:30:11,076 --> 00:30:13,610
It was this
very circular shape...

676
00:30:13,611 --> 00:30:15,878
Biological warfare.
Um, Iran,

677
00:30:15,879 --> 00:30:18,113
and they're probably trying to
get people out of Guantanamo.

678
00:30:18,114 --> 00:30:20,953
I bet everybody's gonna
say it's about global warming.

679
00:30:23,953 --> 00:30:26,557
I still can't get them.
It's going to voicemail.

680
00:30:27,557 --> 00:30:29,057
Well...

681
00:30:29,058 --> 00:30:31,527
We said we'd meet them
at the pier.

682
00:30:31,528 --> 00:30:33,196
That's what we'll do.
We'll meet them at the pier.

683
00:30:33,197 --> 00:30:35,899
- Okay.
- That's the plan. We'll just...

684
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:37,571
do that.

685
00:30:41,571 --> 00:30:44,339
Okay, we have
some more dead fish here.

686
00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:46,541
- All mutilated.
- What?

687
00:30:46,542 --> 00:30:48,644
- All mutilated.
- Oh, mutilated.

688
00:30:48,645 --> 00:30:51,614
We have... here, we have...
the tongue is missing on these.

689
00:30:51,615 --> 00:30:54,383
- No tongue?
- And on these others,

690
00:30:54,384 --> 00:30:57,620
the flesh looks almost
like it's been bitten.

691
00:30:57,621 --> 00:31:01,156
- It's very confusing.
- Why is that?

692
00:31:01,157 --> 00:31:03,527
I'm not sure what does this.

693
00:31:03,528 --> 00:31:05,531
Um, fish don't bite fish.

694
00:31:08,531 --> 00:31:10,232
There she is.

695
00:31:10,233 --> 00:31:11,333
I'm so tired of posing.

696
00:31:11,334 --> 00:31:13,269
- Come on, let me film you.
- No, no, no, no, no.

697
00:31:13,270 --> 00:31:15,470
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Oh, God.

698
00:31:15,471 --> 00:31:17,577
I don't wanna end up
on the Internet.

699
00:31:20,577 --> 00:31:23,444
Come on. It's not like I'm gonna
put you naked on my Facebook page

700
00:31:23,445 --> 00:31:25,180
and see what the comments are.

701
00:31:25,181 --> 00:31:27,248
Well, I might, actually.
Now that I think about it.

702
00:31:27,249 --> 00:31:29,653
Who knows? I could end up
being a pretty big star.

703
00:31:29,654 --> 00:31:32,354
Uh-huh. Sure.
A big star. Whatever.

704
00:31:32,355 --> 00:31:35,391
This was Denise
Button's digital camera.

705
00:31:35,392 --> 00:31:37,594
She was a star pitcher
for the softball team.

706
00:31:37,595 --> 00:31:39,562
A little shirt off.

707
00:31:39,563 --> 00:31:42,265
- Um, I don't think so.
- Let me see this.

708
00:31:42,266 --> 00:31:45,969
- Aw, come on.
- Why do you want me to do that?

709
00:31:45,970 --> 00:31:48,372
'Cause I wanna see
how beautiful you are.

710
00:31:48,373 --> 00:31:50,707
You already know.

711
00:31:50,708 --> 00:31:52,574
You know my mom doesn't like us
being together in the first place,

712
00:31:52,575 --> 00:31:54,478
so why would I do
something even worse?

713
00:31:54,479 --> 00:31:56,616
Because you like me.

714
00:32:00,616 --> 00:32:02,452
All right, but you
better come in with me.

715
00:32:02,453 --> 00:32:04,620
You're coming in,
no doubt about it.

716
00:32:04,621 --> 00:32:07,222
Whoa.

717
00:32:07,223 --> 00:32:08,592
You better come in after me.

718
00:32:08,593 --> 00:32:10,628
Whoo-hoo!

719
00:32:12,628 --> 00:32:15,597
- How's it feel?
- Awesome. Come on!

720
00:32:15,598 --> 00:32:18,567
- No. Mm-mm.
- Come on, baby.

721
00:32:18,568 --> 00:32:21,505
Naw, that's okay. I think you can
just get stung by the jellyfish.

722
00:32:21,506 --> 00:32:23,038
What?

723
00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:25,173
Oh, ha ha.
Very funny.

724
00:32:25,174 --> 00:32:27,743
No, there's seriously
something in the... ow!

725
00:32:27,744 --> 00:32:29,479
You're not getting to me.

726
00:32:31,548 --> 00:32:33,384
You're just jeal...
are you okay?

727
00:32:54,337 --> 00:32:57,672
That camera was
apparently found a month later

728
00:32:57,673 --> 00:33:00,313
by a 12-year-old
on the shore.

729
00:33:03,313 --> 00:33:05,817
Their bodies
were never discovered.

730
00:33:12,722 --> 00:33:16,191
It's so pretty here.

731
00:33:16,192 --> 00:33:18,329
Isn't it?

732
00:33:20,329 --> 00:33:22,297
Hey.

733
00:33:22,298 --> 00:33:23,499
Hello.

734
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:24,468
- Oh, my God. Look behind you.
- What?

735
00:33:24,469 --> 00:33:27,836
Behind you.
It's like a sign.

736
00:33:27,837 --> 00:33:29,806
- Oh, is it?
- Yeah.

737
00:33:29,807 --> 00:33:31,640
It's a sign you wanna
make a little love?

738
00:33:31,641 --> 00:33:33,609
Knock it off.
It's not a sex sign.

739
00:33:33,610 --> 00:33:35,611
Oh, well.
It is to me.

740
00:33:35,612 --> 00:33:38,183
- It is a sex sign to me.
- No, everything is...

741
00:33:40,183 --> 00:33:41,223
Hi.

742
00:33:47,223 --> 00:33:49,659
Come on. It just helps
it a little bit.

743
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:50,960
No, no.

744
00:33:51,028 --> 00:33:53,695
Sometimes
when I watch this footage,

745
00:33:53,696 --> 00:33:56,132
this private footage...

746
00:33:56,133 --> 00:33:57,434
I mean, here they are.

747
00:33:57,435 --> 00:34:01,737
They're being playful.
They're loving one another.

748
00:34:01,738 --> 00:34:05,274
And they have no idea that
something so much darker

749
00:34:05,275 --> 00:34:08,477
and sinister
is about to happen.

750
00:34:08,478 --> 00:34:10,280
- ...you get in the mood?
- Oh, definitely.

751
00:34:10,281 --> 00:34:12,482
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
What are you doing?

752
00:34:12,483 --> 00:34:14,750
There we go.
Let's just cool off a little.

753
00:34:14,751 --> 00:34:16,618
Oh, my God.
Alex, Alex, Alex.

754
00:34:16,619 --> 00:34:18,822
- The camera. Put me down.
- Oh, the camera, the camera.

755
00:34:18,823 --> 00:34:20,594
- Asshole.
- Ouch!

756
00:34:25,628 --> 00:34:26,730
- Serves you right.
- Wow.

757
00:34:26,731 --> 00:34:29,598
Wow, it tastes...

758
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:33,502
How does it feel in there?

759
00:34:33,503 --> 00:34:35,705
Some went in my mouth.

760
00:34:35,706 --> 00:34:38,640
- Oh, you're coming in at some point.
- Looks so good.

761
00:34:38,641 --> 00:34:40,514
You know that, don't you?

762
00:34:43,514 --> 00:34:45,621
Look at you, up there
on your high boat.

763
00:34:50,621 --> 00:34:53,723
About a hundred years ago,
the sea floor was entirely grass bed,

764
00:34:53,724 --> 00:34:57,728
with enough oysters to self-clean
about every four days.

765
00:34:58,728 --> 00:35:02,665
Today, the bay
is 40% dead zone.

766
00:35:02,666 --> 00:35:04,500
There's nothing here.

767
00:35:04,501 --> 00:35:06,534
Wait, I don't understand.
Are you saying that 40%

768
00:35:06,535 --> 00:35:08,639
- of the bay is a dead zone?
- Is good? Is okay?

769
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:11,674
No, no. It's not clear
that 40% is dead.

770
00:35:13,376 --> 00:35:14,776
Dr. Abrams.

771
00:35:14,777 --> 00:35:16,946
The CDC is on the line.

772
00:35:16,947 --> 00:35:19,348
They're on right now?

773
00:35:19,349 --> 00:35:20,751
Can you get somebody
to get an orderly?

774
00:35:20,752 --> 00:35:23,419
Get that guy out of the hall.

775
00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:25,555
Put him in 104.

776
00:35:25,556 --> 00:35:27,489
Well? Well?

777
00:35:27,490 --> 00:35:31,727
Uh, yeah. You said
that you have 30 of these...

778
00:35:31,728 --> 00:35:33,229
I have about 60 people

779
00:35:33,230 --> 00:35:34,963
with some kind of blister
and lesion outbreak.

780
00:35:34,964 --> 00:35:36,632
Some of whom went into
anaphylactic shock.

781
00:35:36,633 --> 00:35:39,266
- I have wart overgrowth...
- Excuse me, you said now you have 60 cases?

782
00:35:39,267 --> 00:35:40,971
I just saw three people
with their tongues half gone.

783
00:35:40,972 --> 00:35:43,672
Okay, that's a lot
of information.

784
00:35:43,673 --> 00:35:46,341
Did you administer methicillin
to the lesion victims?

785
00:35:46,342 --> 00:35:49,645
Of course I gave them methicillin.
It had no response.

786
00:35:49,646 --> 00:35:52,647
- What do you mean?
- It kept spreading.

787
00:35:52,648 --> 00:35:55,451
- In how many cases?
- In all of the cases.

788
00:35:55,452 --> 00:35:56,986
Okay, that's important.

789
00:35:56,987 --> 00:35:58,552
Yeah, I know that's important
because they still have

790
00:35:58,553 --> 00:35:59,623
spreading lesions.

791
00:35:59,624 --> 00:36:01,760
Do you have any
new information for me?

792
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:05,694
Not at this time.

793
00:36:05,695 --> 00:36:07,730
This could be
any number of things.

794
00:36:07,731 --> 00:36:09,698
It could be fungal
or bacterial.

795
00:36:09,699 --> 00:36:12,267
- Fungal?
- We had a tropical fungus outbreak

796
00:36:12,268 --> 00:36:15,437
last year in Vancouver.

797
00:36:15,438 --> 00:36:17,607
Spread in about
three hours, actually.

798
00:36:17,608 --> 00:36:19,741
Vancouver?
Three hours?

799
00:36:19,742 --> 00:36:21,810
Yeah.

800
00:36:21,811 --> 00:36:23,346
With, uh, about 30...

801
00:36:23,347 --> 00:36:24,981
we lost... about 30
people died, I think.

802
00:36:24,982 --> 00:36:26,582
But it was just the fact that

803
00:36:26,583 --> 00:36:28,585
we hadn't seen it in
the northern hemisphere before.

804
00:36:28,586 --> 00:36:30,518
Now, I did wanna ask you.

805
00:36:30,519 --> 00:36:31,822
Did you say that you had people

806
00:36:31,823 --> 00:36:33,756
with half their tongues gone?

807
00:36:33,757 --> 00:36:36,292
Uh, yeah. Hold on.
You didn't get pictures?

808
00:36:36,293 --> 00:36:37,927
Did you send those pictures
to the CDC?

809
00:36:37,928 --> 00:36:39,895
You did?

810
00:36:39,896 --> 00:36:42,531
You should have an attachment
with pictures we sent you.

811
00:36:42,532 --> 00:36:44,033
Do you have them?

812
00:36:44,034 --> 00:36:46,003
Okay.

813
00:36:47,003 --> 00:36:48,703
Okay, we're coming to you

814
00:36:48,704 --> 00:36:50,672
from the straits at Claridge,

815
00:36:50,673 --> 00:36:52,607
where we think we have found...

816
00:36:52,608 --> 00:36:54,310
dun-dun-dun...

817
00:36:54,311 --> 00:36:55,646
the culprit.

818
00:36:55,647 --> 00:36:58,714
Let's go take a look inside
the laboratory here.

819
00:36:58,715 --> 00:37:00,482
See what we got.

820
00:37:00,483 --> 00:37:03,953
As you can see here,
we have these parasites

821
00:37:03,954 --> 00:37:06,855
that seem to have latched
onto the gills.

822
00:37:06,856 --> 00:37:09,424
Oh, my God.

823
00:37:09,425 --> 00:37:11,727
- This is disgusting.
- Right here.

824
00:37:11,728 --> 00:37:14,062
You get it?

825
00:37:14,063 --> 00:37:16,631
There.

826
00:37:16,632 --> 00:37:18,001
This is called

827
00:37:19,001 --> 00:37:21,306
an isopod right here.

828
00:37:23,306 --> 00:37:25,674
It's one of the world's
oldest creatures.

829
00:37:25,675 --> 00:37:27,579
Dates back from the
Carboniferous period.

830
00:37:30,579 --> 00:37:31,318
Here.

831
00:37:35,318 --> 00:37:36,751
- Look at that.
- What is that?

832
00:37:36,752 --> 00:37:38,621
Look at that.

833
00:37:38,622 --> 00:37:40,622
It ate right through
the fish's tongue.

834
00:37:40,623 --> 00:37:42,692
This is enormous.

835
00:37:42,693 --> 00:37:44,794
Do you think
this is an anomaly?

836
00:37:44,795 --> 00:37:47,663
Do I think it's...
"omelee"? What?

837
00:37:47,664 --> 00:37:48,965
No, do you think it's normal?

838
00:37:48,966 --> 00:37:50,598
Oh, anomaly.

839
00:37:50,599 --> 00:37:51,735
- I don't know.
- It's huge.

840
00:37:51,736 --> 00:37:54,502
I think it's... it must be
some kind of mutated version.

841
00:37:54,503 --> 00:37:55,771
Isopods shouldn't even
be in the brackish water.

842
00:37:55,772 --> 00:37:57,576
This is a huge one.

843
00:37:59,576 --> 00:38:01,609
Look at this.

844
00:38:01,610 --> 00:38:04,815
All these isopods
are eating this fish alive.

845
00:38:05,815 --> 00:38:07,018
I don't understand this.

846
00:38:08,018 --> 00:38:09,795
This doesn't make any sense.

847
00:38:19,795 --> 00:38:21,095
What is it?

848
00:38:26,001 --> 00:38:29,071
It aches.

849
00:38:29,072 --> 00:38:30,638
The pain in my...

850
00:38:30,639 --> 00:38:33,543
there's something really wrong.

851
00:38:34,543 --> 00:38:37,697
Help me.

852
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:57,733
What's happening?

853
00:38:57,734 --> 00:38:59,734
I think... I think
you need to see this.

854
00:38:59,735 --> 00:39:01,769
- What's that noise?
- Look how many people are here.

855
00:39:01,770 --> 00:39:03,505
- Oh, my God.
- Look at this.

856
00:39:03,506 --> 00:39:05,507
- Look.
- What's wrong with everyone?

857
00:39:05,508 --> 00:39:06,842
- Look at all these people.
- That's Mr. Long.

858
00:39:06,843 --> 00:39:08,544
They need help.

859
00:39:13,516 --> 00:39:14,918
Did... did you just
hear that?

860
00:39:14,919 --> 00:39:16,618
Look.
Look at this.

861
00:39:16,619 --> 00:39:18,654
Look at this.
Look.

862
00:39:18,655 --> 00:39:22,124
- Somebody help me!
- Please, please. Somebody.

863
00:39:22,125 --> 00:39:24,126
They were just
there for a car show.

864
00:39:24,127 --> 00:39:26,162
Within 24 hours, he got ill.

865
00:39:26,163 --> 00:39:27,831
And they said with
this parasite,

866
00:39:27,832 --> 00:39:29,531
that is what happens.

867
00:39:29,532 --> 00:39:31,635
Only his feet
touched the water,

868
00:39:31,636 --> 00:39:33,669
but a short time later,
he became sick.

869
00:39:33,670 --> 00:39:36,605
Doctors say he
was infected by a bacteria

870
00:39:36,606 --> 00:39:38,741
called Vibrio vulnificus.

871
00:39:38,742 --> 00:39:40,776
If he'd survived,
he would've lost

872
00:39:40,777 --> 00:39:42,912
his arms and legs.

873
00:39:42,913 --> 00:39:45,081
When walking through brackish
water or at the beach,

874
00:39:45,082 --> 00:39:48,116
if you get a cut, don't just
think it's gonna go away.

875
00:39:48,117 --> 00:39:49,019
You have to seek medical
attention immediately

876
00:39:50,019 --> 00:39:52,654
if it starts to turn red or
you start to feel really bad.

877
00:39:52,655 --> 00:39:55,457
The Vibrio vulnificus bacteria

878
00:39:55,458 --> 00:39:59,895
can lead to heart failure,
loss of limbs, or death.

879
00:39:59,896 --> 00:40:01,831
All right, this is the leg
of a man treated today

880
00:40:01,832 --> 00:40:04,036
at Atlantic Hospital
in Maryland.

881
00:40:06,036 --> 00:40:08,736
This is the IR slide
of the same infection.

882
00:40:08,737 --> 00:40:11,607
Notice the bruising
below the skin.

883
00:40:11,608 --> 00:40:13,808
It looks like
Vibrio vulnificus.

884
00:40:13,809 --> 00:40:16,812
Now, it's a bit different than
the normal symptoms of a vibrio

885
00:40:16,813 --> 00:40:19,214
or a Cryptosporidium outbreak.

886
00:40:20,483 --> 00:40:24,553
And we got people up there
with their tongues half gone.

887
00:40:24,554 --> 00:40:27,622
So, what have
we got here, people?

888
00:40:27,623 --> 00:40:29,225
Stephanie?

889
00:40:29,226 --> 00:40:32,727
Stephanie, where are you? You're
not answering your phone.

890
00:40:32,728 --> 00:40:34,662
I've been trying to reach you.

891
00:40:34,663 --> 00:40:36,163
I'm at the hospital.

892
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,734
Your dad is at the hospital.

893
00:40:39,735 --> 00:40:43,805
They're taking him in. He has
some kind of very bad infection.

894
00:40:43,806 --> 00:40:47,509
And I think they're going
to amputate his leg.

895
00:40:47,510 --> 00:40:49,912
It's crazy here.

896
00:40:49,913 --> 00:40:52,515
I mean, really crazy here.

897
00:40:52,516 --> 00:40:55,116
So the most important thing
is to know

898
00:40:55,117 --> 00:40:58,021
that I do not want you
to get off that boat.

899
00:40:59,021 --> 00:41:00,724
Do you hear me, Stephanie?

900
00:41:00,725 --> 00:41:02,697
Don't get off the boat.

901
00:41:07,697 --> 00:41:09,130
- Hey, Stephanie.
- What?

902
00:41:09,131 --> 00:41:10,798
Come up here
for a minute, will ya?

903
00:41:10,799 --> 00:41:13,133
And there is
something else I want you to know.

904
00:41:13,134 --> 00:41:14,836
Look at this boat.
It's just adrift.

905
00:41:14,837 --> 00:41:16,004
I think I need to tell you.

906
00:41:16,005 --> 00:41:17,641
- Grab this camera.
- I have lesions.

907
00:41:17,642 --> 00:41:19,341
Grab the camera...

908
00:41:19,342 --> 00:41:22,611
I think a lot of
people here are not gonna make it.

909
00:41:22,612 --> 00:41:23,445
...and film it
off the side.

910
00:41:23,446 --> 00:41:25,915
I'm gonna come up over...
here it comes.

911
00:41:25,916 --> 00:41:29,084
But remember, I love you,

912
00:41:29,085 --> 00:41:31,921
and I will try to call again.

913
00:41:31,922 --> 00:41:33,226
There's nobody in it.

914
00:41:36,226 --> 00:41:38,802
Hey, you see anyone
in the water?

915
00:41:46,802 --> 00:41:49,671
I don't think we can rule out
a food-borne virus

916
00:41:49,672 --> 00:41:51,105
or anything airborne,

917
00:41:51,106 --> 00:41:53,076
but this looks
like a water vector.

918
00:41:53,077 --> 00:41:56,111
I agree. The blistering
looks like echinococcosis.

919
00:41:56,112 --> 00:41:58,147
The lesions could be

920
00:41:58,148 --> 00:41:59,781
Mycobacterium marinum

921
00:41:59,782 --> 00:42:02,084
or schistosomiasis.

922
00:42:02,085 --> 00:42:04,687
I mean, Jesus, there could
be cholera in there.

923
00:42:04,688 --> 00:42:07,221
Yeah, but I don't see
it spreading this fast.

924
00:42:07,222 --> 00:42:09,657
If the water's being polluted
with anything chemical

925
00:42:09,658 --> 00:42:11,327
on top of the bacteria,
we could easily

926
00:42:11,328 --> 00:42:14,363
be looking at
a new form evolve.

927
00:42:14,364 --> 00:42:15,897
Maybe a fungal bacteria,

928
00:42:15,898 --> 00:42:17,666
maybe a mutated tapeworm.
Who knows?

929
00:42:17,667 --> 00:42:20,268
I need labs back in two.

930
00:42:20,269 --> 00:42:23,638
I need labs back in two. I need
Prolix and I need morphine.

931
00:42:23,639 --> 00:42:25,875
- Somebody call Materials Management...
- Dr. Abrams.

932
00:42:25,876 --> 00:42:28,243
- I need 4x8...
- Dr. Abrams.

933
00:42:28,244 --> 00:42:29,911
- What?
- It's the fellow you amputated.

934
00:42:29,912 --> 00:42:31,748
- What about him?
- It's on the other leg.

935
00:42:31,749 --> 00:42:34,149
- What?
- It's on the other leg.

936
00:42:34,150 --> 00:42:35,984
Christ.
I need morphine in two

937
00:42:35,985 --> 00:42:37,784
and I need labs back.
I need labs back STAT.

938
00:42:37,785 --> 00:42:39,052
I have EPA on the line.

939
00:42:39,053 --> 00:42:40,824
What the hell's going on
at the Chesapeake Bay?

940
00:42:40,825 --> 00:42:42,890
What are you talking about?

941
00:42:42,891 --> 00:42:45,627
Is there anything in there
that could cause disease,

942
00:42:45,628 --> 00:42:47,629
bacterial outbreak,
or mutations?

943
00:42:47,630 --> 00:42:49,865
Well, the bay has been
found to have pollutants,

944
00:42:49,866 --> 00:42:52,834
algae, agricultural runoff,

945
00:42:52,835 --> 00:42:54,837
chicken excrement, um...

946
00:42:54,838 --> 00:42:56,337
Go on.

947
00:42:56,338 --> 00:42:59,741
There was a small leak from
a nuclear reactor in 2002.

948
00:42:59,742 --> 00:43:01,878
- God damn it.
- But we weren't expecting it to hit the bay

949
00:43:01,879 --> 00:43:03,379
till 2014.

950
00:43:03,380 --> 00:43:04,713
But it is coming
through the ground,

951
00:43:04,714 --> 00:43:06,214
so it could've hit earlier.

952
00:43:06,215 --> 00:43:07,883
Are people drinking this water?

953
00:43:07,884 --> 00:43:10,085
Of course not. The bay is brackish.
You can't drink it.

954
00:43:10,086 --> 00:43:14,055
There is a level of seepage
into local wells

955
00:43:14,056 --> 00:43:16,257
and of course the desalination
plant in Claridge.

956
00:43:16,258 --> 00:43:18,094
With that desalination plant,

957
00:43:18,095 --> 00:43:20,129
we have increased the capacity

958
00:43:20,130 --> 00:43:21,965
for poultry farming
in the area.

959
00:43:21,966 --> 00:43:23,866
Those chickens drink about

960
00:43:23,867 --> 00:43:26,234
2,000 gallons of water a day.

961
00:43:26,235 --> 00:43:29,705
I think the NEF said it was
0.3 liters of dirty water,

962
00:43:29,706 --> 00:43:31,438
so there could be radium
or tritium in there.

963
00:43:31,439 --> 00:43:33,376
...endocrine
disruptors, pharmaceuticals...

964
00:43:33,377 --> 00:43:35,910
Algae, agricultural
runoff, chicken excrement...

965
00:43:35,911 --> 00:43:39,281
There was a small leak from
a nuclear reactor in 2002...

966
00:43:39,282 --> 00:43:40,915
And you don't warn anyone?

967
00:43:40,916 --> 00:43:42,883
Well, it's not under
our regulations

968
00:43:42,884 --> 00:43:45,088
to test for
radioactivity levels in water.

969
00:43:45,089 --> 00:43:48,089
Look... half the water in America
probably has some leaks in it.

970
00:43:48,090 --> 00:43:49,792
Don't you regulate the water?

971
00:43:49,793 --> 00:43:52,931
The filtered water has met
all regulatory standards.

972
00:43:55,931 --> 00:43:59,201
- That dome over there...
- 5 million pounds of chicken shit

973
00:43:59,202 --> 00:44:00,869
dumped into the bay each year.

974
00:44:00,870 --> 00:44:03,842
This is the best darn water
I've ever tasted.

975
00:44:11,514 --> 00:44:13,349
What are you doing?
Let's go back this way.

976
00:44:13,350 --> 00:44:16,484
- Just hold on.
- What are you doing?

977
00:44:16,485 --> 00:44:18,721
I can't...
I'm burning up.

978
00:44:18,722 --> 00:44:20,123
Let me just put
some water on my face.

979
00:44:20,124 --> 00:44:21,492
Jesus.

980
00:44:23,492 --> 00:44:25,927
That's my cameraman, Jim Hoyt.

981
00:44:25,928 --> 00:44:27,496
- Hey, Katie Couric.
- Um...

982
00:44:27,497 --> 00:44:29,765
Can you just chill
the fuck out for two seconds?

983
00:44:29,766 --> 00:44:32,500
I think that's the only time
we actually ever see him.

984
00:44:32,501 --> 00:44:35,337
- That's not an insult. I like her.
- He died that night.

985
00:44:35,338 --> 00:44:38,941
- I know you do.
- A lot of this footage

986
00:44:38,942 --> 00:44:40,843
is thanks to him.

987
00:44:40,844 --> 00:44:41,742
Where are you going?

988
00:44:41,743 --> 00:44:43,376
Governor's office.

989
00:44:43,377 --> 00:44:45,278
Yeah, hi.
This is Dr. Jack Abrams.

990
00:44:45,279 --> 00:44:47,050
I'm at the Atlantic Hospital
in Claridge.

991
00:44:47,051 --> 00:44:49,785
I need to speak
to the governor immediately.

992
00:44:49,786 --> 00:44:51,786
The governor is
away from his desk.

993
00:44:51,787 --> 00:44:53,854
I don't
understand how the nurses

994
00:44:53,855 --> 00:44:56,057
are just hurrying by
and they're not even stopping.

995
00:44:56,058 --> 00:44:57,492
Look at that.
She didn't even stop.

996
00:44:57,493 --> 00:44:58,996
Scoot up.

997
00:44:58,997 --> 00:45:02,531
- Look, I am.
- There are like 20 feet in front of us.

998
00:45:02,532 --> 00:45:04,533
- Jesus.
- Dad!

999
00:45:04,534 --> 00:45:06,867
Stop honking the horn!

1000
00:45:06,868 --> 00:45:08,536
- Please stop texting.
- I'm not texting.

1001
00:45:08,537 --> 00:45:09,871
Please don't be YouTubeing this.
Please.

1002
00:45:09,872 --> 00:45:11,007
Oh, my God. She
just said "YouTubeing."

1003
00:45:12,007 --> 00:45:14,277
We're having an
outbreak of some kind here.

1004
00:45:14,278 --> 00:45:16,845
A medical outbreak
down here in Claridge.

1005
00:45:16,846 --> 00:45:18,546
People are dying here.

1006
00:45:18,547 --> 00:45:20,081
I have been speaking to the CDC

1007
00:45:20,082 --> 00:45:22,048
They are moving
at a snail's pace...

1008
00:45:22,049 --> 00:45:23,516
I will pass the
message on to the governor

1009
00:45:23,517 --> 00:45:25,021
- as soon as he gets back.
- What do you mean, you have it?

1010
00:45:26,021 --> 00:45:29,957
Well, go. Go out there and
document everybody that you see.

1011
00:45:29,958 --> 00:45:32,160
Don't document me.
Don't waste the damn film.

1012
00:45:32,161 --> 00:45:33,461
Get back in, please.

1013
00:45:33,462 --> 00:45:35,565
Nobody
ever got off that bridge.

1014
00:45:35,566 --> 00:45:38,866
It was shut down
for three days, actually.

1015
00:45:38,867 --> 00:45:40,368
Um...

1016
00:45:40,369 --> 00:45:42,571
I did a lot of research.

1017
00:45:42,572 --> 00:45:45,874
There's no record
of who ordered it shut down.

1018
00:45:45,875 --> 00:45:48,442
I got it on autopilot.

1019
00:45:48,443 --> 00:45:51,117
- Oh, good.
- Yeah.

1020
00:45:54,117 --> 00:45:56,083
- GPS is amazing.
- Oh, yeah?

1021
00:45:56,084 --> 00:45:57,487
Really mastered the technology.

1022
00:45:57,488 --> 00:46:00,023
- Yeah, well...
- They said take the next right, though.

1023
00:46:01,023 --> 00:46:02,893
And I don't know
what they're referring to.

1024
00:46:04,893 --> 00:46:08,280
- Just go around in circles.
- That's fine by me.

1025
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:25,912
You know, we don't
have to be here.

1026
00:46:25,913 --> 00:46:27,148
They're not gonna
post any of this.

1027
00:46:27,149 --> 00:46:29,115
The FBI are not gonna allow it.

1028
00:46:29,116 --> 00:46:30,818
They said we shouldn't
try and scare people.

1029
00:46:30,819 --> 00:46:32,854
Well, there's a little
something called the First Amendment.

1030
00:46:32,855 --> 00:46:34,161
- Is it rolling?
- Yeah, we're rolling.

1031
00:46:38,161 --> 00:46:39,861
Good evening.

1032
00:46:39,862 --> 00:46:42,397
This is Donna Thompson
reporting from what used to be

1033
00:46:42,398 --> 00:46:44,399
the fairgrounds
of the July 4th party...

1034
00:46:48,070 --> 00:46:51,339
- Did you hear that?
- Yeah, what was it?

1035
00:46:51,340 --> 00:46:53,508
What the fuck is that?

1036
00:46:57,614 --> 00:46:59,650
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1037
00:47:07,623 --> 00:47:09,525
You say you
were hearing these screams

1038
00:47:09,526 --> 00:47:14,096
all across...

1039
00:47:14,097 --> 00:47:15,632
I'm sorry. The Skype
broke up a little bit.

1040
00:47:15,633 --> 00:47:17,332
What did you say?

1041
00:47:17,333 --> 00:47:18,633
Just echoing through the air?

1042
00:47:18,634 --> 00:47:20,436
I mean, all different
directions?

1043
00:47:20,437 --> 00:47:22,904
Oh, yeah.
I mean, there...

1044
00:47:22,905 --> 00:47:26,207
it was very faint,
but it was very,

1045
00:47:26,208 --> 00:47:28,477
um, prominent.

1046
00:47:28,478 --> 00:47:30,611
I heard them coming from here.

1047
00:47:30,612 --> 00:47:32,514
I've heard them
coming from there.

1048
00:47:32,515 --> 00:47:35,552
It was far away, but...

1049
00:47:36,552 --> 00:47:39,955
it was very ghostlike.

1050
00:47:39,956 --> 00:47:42,524
You know, I...

1051
00:47:42,525 --> 00:47:46,361
And the pain in the people's
voices, I could hear them.

1052
00:47:46,362 --> 00:47:48,430
They were like cries or...

1053
00:47:48,431 --> 00:47:50,232
like cries for help.

1054
00:47:50,233 --> 00:47:51,534
But you didn't know
where anyone was?

1055
00:47:51,535 --> 00:47:55,569
No. I had no idea
where anybody was.

1056
00:47:55,570 --> 00:47:57,505
Be advised.
Need you to respond

1057
00:47:57,506 --> 00:47:59,507
to the corner of
St. James and Highmarket.

1058
00:47:59,508 --> 00:48:01,411
We just got a phone call
in reference to

1059
00:48:01,412 --> 00:48:03,678
hearing some screaming
or some type of

1060
00:48:03,679 --> 00:48:07,082
loud verbal noises
from across the street.

1061
00:48:09,552 --> 00:48:13,522
You think it's, like,
a group or one person?

1062
00:48:13,523 --> 00:48:16,223
- I don't know.
- Like, maybe one of those cults, you know?

1063
00:48:16,224 --> 00:48:18,225
Like they were talking
about on the radio?

1064
00:48:18,226 --> 00:48:20,436
I don't know.

1065
00:48:27,436 --> 00:48:28,971
All right.

1066
00:48:28,972 --> 00:48:30,706
Stay here and keep
your eyes out, huh?

1067
00:48:30,707 --> 00:48:31,874
All right.

1068
00:48:31,875 --> 00:48:35,310
What was that?

1069
00:48:38,581 --> 00:48:40,448
Did you hear that?

1070
00:48:48,557 --> 00:48:50,297
Police, open up.

1071
00:48:57,266 --> 00:48:59,567
Police, open up.

1072
00:48:59,568 --> 00:49:01,005
I'm gonna go in.

1073
00:49:03,005 --> 00:49:04,541
Hello?

1074
00:49:06,541 --> 00:49:08,146
Hello?

1075
00:49:10,146 --> 00:49:13,314
This is Donna Thompson
reporting from what used to be

1076
00:49:13,315 --> 00:49:16,350
the fairgrounds of the July 4th party.

1077
00:49:16,351 --> 00:49:19,601
Um, at the moment, we are not
quite sure what's going on.

1078
00:49:37,407 --> 00:49:39,442
Central, this is SM 10-12.

1079
00:49:39,443 --> 00:49:41,276
Be advised, shots fired,

1080
00:49:41,277 --> 00:49:43,544
shots fired
at 352 St. James Street.

1081
00:49:43,545 --> 00:49:45,613
Send assistance immediately.

1082
00:49:47,784 --> 00:49:50,621
Central, advise.
Did you copy?

1083
00:49:52,621 --> 00:49:55,256
Central, please advise.
Do you copy?

1084
00:49:55,257 --> 00:49:56,592
Send backup.
A shot has been fired

1085
00:49:56,593 --> 00:49:59,431
- Jim?
- at 352 St. James Street.

1086
00:50:02,431 --> 00:50:04,432
- Central, be advised...
- Jim, are you in there?

1087
00:50:04,433 --> 00:50:05,666
I don't know if
anyone's listening there.

1088
00:50:05,667 --> 00:50:07,402
I'm gonna enter
the premises now.

1089
00:50:07,403 --> 00:50:10,504
SM 10-18 is
currently inside.

1090
00:50:10,505 --> 00:50:13,480
- Please send backup.
- Jim?

1091
00:50:17,480 --> 00:50:19,113
Jim!

1092
00:50:19,114 --> 00:50:22,320
I'm coming in!
I'm coming in!

1093
00:50:25,320 --> 00:50:27,190
- Oh, my God. What's this?
- Please!

1094
00:50:27,191 --> 00:50:29,558
What are you doing?

1095
00:50:29,559 --> 00:50:31,094
No, no, they're not
dying, they're not dying.

1096
00:50:31,095 --> 00:50:34,328
They're all dying, they're all dying.
Look at them all.

1097
00:50:34,329 --> 00:50:36,701
No way. What
have you done, Jim?

1098
00:50:38,701 --> 00:50:40,602
Oh, my God.

1099
00:50:40,603 --> 00:50:42,403
I don't know...
I don't know what they are.

1100
00:50:42,404 --> 00:50:43,873
- What is on those people?
- I don't know what it is.

1101
00:50:43,874 --> 00:50:46,210
It's crawling on their bodies.

1102
00:50:52,181 --> 00:50:54,690
Let's get out of here!

1103
00:51:01,690 --> 00:51:04,831
Did you cut it off?

1104
00:51:09,831 --> 00:51:11,533
You can't do this.

1105
00:51:11,534 --> 00:51:13,509
You can't do this!
Oh, my God!

1106
00:51:19,509 --> 00:51:21,713
Get it off, get it off!

1107
00:51:26,849 --> 00:51:28,549
Jim, wait.

1108
00:51:28,550 --> 00:51:30,452
Jim, no, no, no, no!
It's me, Paul.

1109
00:51:36,492 --> 00:51:38,762
This is Cessna 1-5-7.

1110
00:51:39,762 --> 00:51:42,230
Go ahead, Cessna 1-5-7.

1111
00:51:42,231 --> 00:51:45,466
I'm just trying to
figure out what the hell's going on.

1112
00:51:45,467 --> 00:51:47,936
I know they shut down all the
roads going into Claridge,

1113
00:51:47,937 --> 00:51:49,937
but now I'm flying over
the water here

1114
00:51:49,938 --> 00:51:52,674
and there's just, like,
a shitload

1115
00:51:52,675 --> 00:51:54,743
of dead fish everywhere.

1116
00:51:54,744 --> 00:51:57,379
Did you say "dead fish"?

1117
00:51:57,380 --> 00:51:58,914
I don't know
how many, but, um...

1118
00:51:58,915 --> 00:52:01,716
it goes as far as I can see.

1119
00:52:01,717 --> 00:52:03,551
So you just got this?

1120
00:52:03,552 --> 00:52:05,719
Yeah, from a research professor

1121
00:52:05,720 --> 00:52:07,590
at the University of Maryland.

1122
00:52:07,591 --> 00:52:10,759
And this, uh, Cymothoa exigua?

1123
00:52:10,760 --> 00:52:12,728
Do we have any
information on this?

1124
00:52:12,729 --> 00:52:15,629
Yeah, the exigua
is a crustaceous isopod

1125
00:52:15,630 --> 00:52:17,732
normally found in the Pacific.

1126
00:52:17,733 --> 00:52:20,435
It's been making a number of
appearances in the Atlantic.

1127
00:52:20,436 --> 00:52:22,803
Last year, they found a
two-and-a-half-foot one

1128
00:52:22,804 --> 00:52:25,674
trying to burrow its way
into a submarine.

1129
00:52:25,675 --> 00:52:27,476
The thing thought it
was a dead whale.

1130
00:52:27,477 --> 00:52:30,914
Are you making this up?
This looks Photoshopped.

1131
00:52:31,914 --> 00:52:33,853
No, it's real.

1132
00:52:37,853 --> 00:52:40,654
So, how's that getting
into the water supply?

1133
00:52:40,655 --> 00:52:43,591
Well, at normal
scale, they're quite common.

1134
00:52:43,592 --> 00:52:45,360
The fishermen
call them "sea lice."

1135
00:52:45,361 --> 00:52:47,729
Yeah, but, I mean,
it's this big.

1136
00:52:47,730 --> 00:52:49,897
How's it gonna get through
a filtration system?

1137
00:52:49,898 --> 00:52:51,802
Well, what about the larvae?

1138
00:52:53,802 --> 00:52:56,303
All right, now we're bringing up
more questions than we can answer.

1139
00:52:56,304 --> 00:52:58,306
We gotta find out what
happened to those two divers.

1140
00:52:58,307 --> 00:53:00,375
Yeah?

1141
00:53:00,376 --> 00:53:01,317
Let's go.

1142
00:53:08,317 --> 00:53:09,618
Okay, here we are.

1143
00:53:09,619 --> 00:53:11,586
We got a nice break
in the weather.

1144
00:53:11,587 --> 00:53:14,791
So, we're gonna go catch
the current out to Claridge,

1145
00:53:15,791 --> 00:53:19,727
take an up-close, personal
look at these parasites.

1146
00:53:19,728 --> 00:53:21,766
See what we're dealing with.

1147
00:53:23,766 --> 00:53:25,600
See, you take a look around,

1148
00:53:25,601 --> 00:53:28,636
it's beautiful.
It's breathtaking.

1149
00:53:28,637 --> 00:53:30,672
One of the most beautiful
estuaries in all of America.

1150
00:53:30,673 --> 00:53:33,411
You'd have no idea
what's underneath.

1151
00:53:36,411 --> 00:53:38,712
How was that? Was that
not very good at all?

1152
00:53:38,713 --> 00:53:40,682
- Great.
- What?

1153
00:53:42,385 --> 00:53:43,686
- That was very good.
- Okay, one more time.

1154
00:53:43,687 --> 00:53:45,319
A little crisper.

1155
00:53:45,320 --> 00:53:46,989
I feel like I'm sitting
very strangely.

1156
00:53:46,990 --> 00:53:48,989
Do people sit
like this? Okay.

1157
00:53:48,990 --> 00:53:50,725
Now bring the camera to me.

1158
00:53:50,726 --> 00:53:53,030
I'm gonna get us
some beauty shots here.

1159
00:53:54,030 --> 00:53:57,299
Get a sense of place here.

1160
00:53:57,300 --> 00:53:59,373
You wanna see the vista,
here, and the sun.

1161
00:54:04,373 --> 00:54:05,943
Beautiful water.

1162
00:54:08,943 --> 00:54:10,012
Beautiful, placid water.

1163
00:54:11,012 --> 00:54:13,081
You have no sense
of how the ecosystem's

1164
00:54:13,082 --> 00:54:14,751
actually being affected.

1165
00:54:16,751 --> 00:54:18,425
You have no idea of the
nightmare underneath here.

1166
00:54:28,063 --> 00:54:30,931
Take an up close and personal
look at these parasites.

1167
00:54:30,932 --> 00:54:32,969
See what we're actually
dealing with.

1168
00:54:33,969 --> 00:54:35,949
We'll go take a look ourselves.

1169
00:55:45,039 --> 00:55:46,942
You can see in this footage

1170
00:55:46,943 --> 00:55:49,910
that the oceanographers dove
right into a school

1171
00:55:49,911 --> 00:55:51,914
of fully-grown isopods.

1172
00:55:52,914 --> 00:55:55,116
This is not
the sea lice variety

1173
00:55:55,117 --> 00:55:56,554
or the larvae.

1174
00:55:58,554 --> 00:56:00,955
This is what killed them.

1175
00:56:00,956 --> 00:56:03,027
And what killed
those young teenagers.

1176
00:56:05,027 --> 00:56:07,162
The question we
continue to ask is,

1177
00:56:07,163 --> 00:56:09,897
did the authorities
not look at this footage?

1178
00:56:09,898 --> 00:56:12,769
Or chose not to reveal it?

1179
00:56:14,769 --> 00:56:16,471
Jim?

1180
00:56:16,472 --> 00:56:17,442
Jim?

1181
00:56:19,442 --> 00:56:21,576
Do you hear that?

1182
00:56:24,612 --> 00:56:26,916
I hear something.

1183
00:56:32,954 --> 00:56:34,233
Yeah, I hear it.

1184
00:56:45,233 --> 00:56:47,940
It's this way.

1185
00:56:53,641 --> 00:56:55,043
Do you fucking hear that?

1186
00:56:55,044 --> 00:56:57,717
It's like a moaning
or something.

1187
00:57:02,717 --> 00:57:04,786
Can you come closer?

1188
00:57:39,255 --> 00:57:41,922
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

1189
00:57:41,923 --> 00:57:43,790
Oh!

1190
00:57:46,027 --> 00:57:47,729
What do I need to do, Doctor?

1191
00:57:47,730 --> 00:57:49,298
What do I need to do?

1192
00:57:50,298 --> 00:57:51,966
Well, I would suggest that

1193
00:57:51,967 --> 00:57:53,670
you and your staff
leave the hospital.

1194
00:57:55,670 --> 00:57:57,840
My staff left 20 minutes ago.

1195
00:57:58,840 --> 00:58:00,607
Well, good.
That's wise.

1196
00:58:00,608 --> 00:58:02,709
Wise? That's...
why is that wise?

1197
00:58:02,710 --> 00:58:05,046
Well, because the bacteria...

1198
00:58:05,047 --> 00:58:08,582
uh, the... once it's
entered the human body...

1199
00:58:08,583 --> 00:58:11,755
it's a miracle you aren't infected
already, as a matter of fact.

1200
00:58:13,755 --> 00:58:16,089
- I'm... I'm fine.
- Well, that's good.

1201
00:58:16,090 --> 00:58:17,959
But what I'm saying is that,

1202
00:58:17,960 --> 00:58:19,661
at this point,
it is too late, Doctor.

1203
00:58:19,662 --> 00:58:22,798
And I strongly suggest that
you leave immediately.

1204
00:58:23,798 --> 00:58:25,866
Look, I have people
in pain here.

1205
00:58:25,867 --> 00:58:28,937
I'm amputating feet,
I'm amputating legs,

1206
00:58:28,938 --> 00:58:30,903
I'm amputating arms.
You want me to get up

1207
00:58:30,904 --> 00:58:32,740
- and just leave the hospital?
- Yes, we're aware of that,

1208
00:58:32,741 --> 00:58:36,109
Doctor, and we are sorry.

1209
00:58:36,110 --> 00:58:38,079
You need to get...
you need to get somewhere.

1210
00:58:38,080 --> 00:58:39,247
Get some help.

1211
00:58:39,248 --> 00:58:41,848
But don't come here 'cause
they're not gonna help you.

1212
00:58:41,849 --> 00:58:43,618
And they're not helping me.

1213
00:58:43,619 --> 00:58:45,318
It looks like there
are dead bodies up there.

1214
00:58:45,319 --> 00:58:46,787
- It's only a rash.
- I'm being serious.

1215
00:58:46,788 --> 00:58:48,856
- Dead people. They're not breathing.
- How can people be dead?

1216
00:58:48,857 --> 00:58:51,658
They just collapsed and no
one's coming out to get them.

1217
00:58:51,659 --> 00:58:54,094
- Nothing. Nope. No one.
- And no one's helping?

1218
00:58:54,095 --> 00:58:55,697
Jennifer, is
your tongue hurting?

1219
00:58:55,698 --> 00:58:57,931
Mine hurts so badly.

1220
00:58:57,932 --> 00:58:59,667
I'm just...
I'm really scared.

1221
00:58:59,668 --> 00:59:01,903
I don't know what to do.

1222
00:59:01,904 --> 00:59:03,805
I just... I don't
wanna hang up.

1223
00:59:03,806 --> 00:59:05,739
I don't wanna be by myself.

1224
00:59:05,740 --> 00:59:07,253
I can't get anyone...

1225
00:59:18,253 --> 00:59:20,387
Can you see my parents?
Are they here?

1226
00:59:20,388 --> 00:59:21,554
No.

1227
00:59:21,555 --> 00:59:23,692
There's a bunch of dead shit
in the water.

1228
00:59:23,693 --> 00:59:26,694
- Whoa.
- What is that stuff?

1229
00:59:26,695 --> 00:59:28,231
That is weird.

1230
00:59:30,231 --> 00:59:31,865
Have you heard
anything from the governor yet?

1231
00:59:31,866 --> 00:59:33,766
Yes, Lee. I talked to him.

1232
00:59:33,767 --> 00:59:35,635
The governor wanted to know
if we should call

1233
00:59:35,636 --> 00:59:36,771
a state of emergency.

1234
00:59:36,772 --> 00:59:38,840
And I told him to give us
a few more hours

1235
00:59:38,841 --> 00:59:40,509
to get a handle on this.

1236
00:59:40,510 --> 00:59:43,378
Some of the folks have nothing wrong
with them, for heaven's sake.

1237
00:59:43,379 --> 00:59:46,747
And the CDC doesn't even know
if it's contagious.

1238
00:59:46,748 --> 00:59:49,217
We've got the National Guard isolating us...

1239
00:59:49,218 --> 00:59:51,919
...from surrounding communities
as a preventative measure.

1240
00:59:51,920 --> 00:59:54,689
If we get people in here
with those hazmat suits,

1241
00:59:54,690 --> 00:59:56,425
all hell's gonna break loose.

1242
00:59:56,426 --> 00:59:59,227
Now listen, Lee. Right now
we've got no media on this

1243
00:59:59,228 --> 01:00:00,727
except that student running
around with a camera.

1244
01:00:01,362 --> 01:00:03,765
And the FBI shut down her blog.

1245
01:00:03,766 --> 01:00:04,766
So let's keep it that way.

1246
01:00:04,767 --> 01:00:07,768
And, Lee, you and your deputies

1247
01:00:07,769 --> 01:00:09,735
have got to get on top of this.

1248
01:00:09,736 --> 01:00:11,739
I lost all
contact with my deputies

1249
01:00:11,740 --> 01:00:13,808
about 30 minutes ago.

1250
01:00:13,809 --> 01:00:15,343
What?

1251
01:00:15,344 --> 01:00:18,111
I'm not getting any
response from my guys.

1252
01:00:18,112 --> 01:00:20,881
Well, we shut
down all the towers

1253
01:00:20,882 --> 01:00:22,783
to kill the cell phones,

1254
01:00:22,784 --> 01:00:24,951
but it shouldn't
affect you guys.

1255
01:00:24,952 --> 01:00:26,221
Listen, Lee.

1256
01:00:26,222 --> 01:00:28,723
Why don't you swing by
and pick me up right now?

1257
01:00:28,724 --> 01:00:31,994
I wanna get a firsthand look
at what's going on out there.

1258
01:00:32,994 --> 01:00:35,233
All right, I'll be by there
in about five minutes.

1259
01:00:38,233 --> 01:00:39,373
You okay?

1260
01:00:44,373 --> 01:00:47,382
I don't think I've ever been
so scared in my whole life.

1261
01:00:53,382 --> 01:00:54,982
Is the blood off my face?

1262
01:00:54,983 --> 01:00:57,084
- What?
- Is the blood off my face?

1263
01:00:57,085 --> 01:00:59,297
No, you've got
a ton on your side.

1264
01:01:08,297 --> 01:01:09,796
What the...

1265
01:01:09,797 --> 01:01:11,300
- What?
- What is that?

1266
01:01:11,301 --> 01:01:12,800
What is it?

1267
01:01:12,801 --> 01:01:15,303
Holy shit.

1268
01:01:15,304 --> 01:01:17,304
- Fuck.
- What the fuck?

1269
01:01:19,108 --> 01:01:21,041
- Oh.
- Oh, my God.

1270
01:01:21,042 --> 01:01:22,876
Look at his face.

1271
01:01:22,877 --> 01:01:25,083
- Oh, my God.
- Look at his face.

1272
01:01:33,856 --> 01:01:35,324
Oh, my God.

1273
01:01:35,325 --> 01:01:37,792
Look at me,
I was running in a circle.

1274
01:01:37,793 --> 01:01:40,962
I mean, if it wasn't...

1275
01:01:40,963 --> 01:01:43,497
if this wasn't
a tragedy situation,

1276
01:01:43,498 --> 01:01:45,500
it would actually
be somewhat comedic.

1277
01:01:45,501 --> 01:01:47,100
Um...

1278
01:01:47,101 --> 01:01:49,437
I was just so fucking scared.

1279
01:01:49,438 --> 01:01:53,207
I... I never reported
another thing after that

1280
01:01:53,208 --> 01:01:55,176
until I made this film.

1281
01:01:55,177 --> 01:01:56,347
I...

1282
01:02:00,414 --> 01:02:03,824
That was actually
the last footage we shot.

1283
01:02:08,824 --> 01:02:10,358
Well, I'll come and
get the rest of the stuff

1284
01:02:10,359 --> 01:02:14,395
when we figure out
where we're going.

1285
01:02:16,431 --> 01:02:19,299
Where are you leading us
other than off of this dock?

1286
01:02:19,300 --> 01:02:21,868
Alex, where do you think?
I have no idea.

1287
01:02:21,869 --> 01:02:23,837
I can't get a hold of them.

1288
01:02:23,838 --> 01:02:25,939
This is quite a greeting,
isn't it?

1289
01:02:25,940 --> 01:02:27,442
- Oh, come on.
- This is pretty nice.

1290
01:02:27,443 --> 01:02:28,942
You know, would you please...

1291
01:02:28,943 --> 01:02:31,379
- it's...
- All documented.

1292
01:02:31,380 --> 01:02:35,482
This is the quietest
4th of July I have ever seen.

1293
01:02:35,483 --> 01:02:37,518
We missed the fireworks?
What the hell's going on?

1294
01:02:37,519 --> 01:02:38,852
Yeah, what's with that?

1295
01:02:38,853 --> 01:02:41,823
Is it necessary
to get video of this?

1296
01:02:41,824 --> 01:02:45,526
Yes, I am filming
the lack of fireworks

1297
01:02:45,527 --> 01:02:47,896
so we can show your parents
we were here

1298
01:02:47,897 --> 01:02:50,531
- for the nonfestivities.
- Oh, great. You know, they'll...

1299
01:02:50,532 --> 01:02:53,433
When Alex and
Stephanie got to Claridge,

1300
01:02:53,434 --> 01:02:58,339
more than 700 people had died.

1301
01:02:58,340 --> 01:03:00,908
And here they were,
coming in with a baby.

1302
01:03:00,909 --> 01:03:02,842
...this celebration
for 4th of July.

1303
01:03:02,843 --> 01:03:04,146
Would you
please... You know...

1304
01:03:04,147 --> 01:03:07,180
if you would turn the damn camera
off and help me look for them,

1305
01:03:07,181 --> 01:03:08,849
that might be
a little more useful.

1306
01:03:08,850 --> 01:03:10,418
Oh, you're doing great.
You're doing just...

1307
01:03:10,419 --> 01:03:13,520
- This is fantastic. I love it when you...
- This is ridiculous.

1308
01:03:13,521 --> 01:03:16,424
make me be the grown-up and
you don't do any of the work.

1309
01:03:16,425 --> 01:03:20,093
- They all look...
- What the hell is that?

1310
01:03:20,094 --> 01:03:22,163
Oh, my God.

1311
01:03:22,164 --> 01:03:23,864
Oh, God.

1312
01:03:23,865 --> 01:03:26,200
- Alex, Alex...
- Holy shit.

1313
01:03:26,201 --> 01:03:27,700
- Alex, do not take...
- Hello?

1314
01:03:27,701 --> 01:03:30,137
- I wanna get out of here.
- Oh, my God.

1315
01:03:30,138 --> 01:03:34,341
- Look at this.
- Do not get any closer.

1316
01:03:34,342 --> 01:03:37,078
- I want to get out of here...
- Where are we gonna go?

1317
01:03:37,079 --> 01:03:39,479
I don't wanna be out here with
a dead body and Andrew here...

1318
01:03:39,480 --> 01:03:41,380
- Aw, Jesus.
- Stop.

1319
01:03:41,381 --> 01:03:43,487
- No, just...
- Get away from... don't touch her.

1320
01:03:45,487 --> 01:03:47,988
Yes, of course.
A toxic soup of chemicals

1321
01:03:47,989 --> 01:03:49,624
could produce
certain mutations.

1322
01:03:49,625 --> 01:03:51,592
What's also concerning
is the level

1323
01:03:51,593 --> 01:03:53,426
of chicken excrement
in the bay.

1324
01:03:53,427 --> 01:03:56,129
I mean, if the numbers
you gave me are correct,

1325
01:03:56,130 --> 01:03:58,001
the amount of steroids
in that amount of manure,

1326
01:03:59,001 --> 01:04:01,468
um, could be
accelerating growth

1327
01:04:01,469 --> 01:04:03,537
by 50, 60 times.

1328
01:04:03,538 --> 01:04:05,939
That's both in size
and quantity.

1329
01:04:05,940 --> 01:04:09,377
This stuff has so much
chemical steroid in it,

1330
01:04:09,378 --> 01:04:11,679
it will take a little birdie,
turn it into a fullgrown birdie

1331
01:04:11,680 --> 01:04:15,448
in 42 days, what Mother Nature
would take six months.

1332
01:04:15,449 --> 01:04:17,585
They think it's feeding off the
nutrients from the chicken runoff.

1333
01:04:17,586 --> 01:04:19,553
We've noticed
a five-to-one

1334
01:04:19,554 --> 01:04:22,589
female-to-male ratio
among these fish here.

1335
01:04:22,590 --> 01:04:25,558
We could easily be looking
at a new form evolve.

1336
01:04:25,559 --> 01:04:27,662
Ow! Son of a bitch!

1337
01:04:27,663 --> 01:04:29,628
Must be some kind
of mutated version.

1338
01:04:29,629 --> 01:04:31,532
Isopods shouldn't even
be in the brackish water.

1339
01:04:31,533 --> 01:04:33,167
I would like to give Buzz

1340
01:04:33,168 --> 01:04:34,535
a big round of applause

1341
01:04:34,536 --> 01:04:36,504
for getting these
misters going.

1342
01:04:38,606 --> 01:04:40,574
Are people drinking this water?

1343
01:04:40,575 --> 01:04:42,176
Some went in my mouth.

1344
01:04:42,177 --> 01:04:44,144
How's it gonna get through
a filtration system?

1345
01:04:44,145 --> 01:04:45,148
What about the larvae?

1346
01:04:47,148 --> 01:04:49,385
The desalination plant
in Claridge...

1347
01:04:51,385 --> 01:04:53,655
A new
form evolve... Steroids...

1348
01:04:53,656 --> 01:04:56,691
So much chemical steroid...
Mutated version...

1349
01:04:56,692 --> 01:04:58,458
They found a
two-and-a-half-foot one

1350
01:04:58,459 --> 01:05:00,461
trying to burrow its way
into a submarine...

1351
01:05:00,462 --> 01:05:02,632
Jane? Jane.

1352
01:05:03,632 --> 01:05:06,232
Get me...

1353
01:05:06,233 --> 01:05:07,206
Will you get me
the White House?

1354
01:05:11,206 --> 01:05:12,639
Oh, my God.

1355
01:05:12,640 --> 01:05:14,576
- Oh, my God.
- Careful, please.

1356
01:05:14,577 --> 01:05:17,111
Oh, you're kidding me.
Holy shit.

1357
01:05:17,112 --> 01:05:19,613
- Oh, my God.
- What the fuck?

1358
01:05:19,614 --> 01:05:22,018
Oh, my God.

1359
01:05:24,018 --> 01:05:26,220
Where the hell are we?

1360
01:05:26,221 --> 01:05:29,689
Apparently, a lot
of people came up to Main Street.

1361
01:05:29,690 --> 01:05:31,759
And they were
just waiting for an EMS

1362
01:05:31,760 --> 01:05:34,694
or an ambulance
or someone to come by.

1363
01:05:34,695 --> 01:05:36,565
- Alex, I wanna go.
- Where do you want to go?

1364
01:05:36,566 --> 01:05:39,200
They were just
waiting and hoping.

1365
01:05:39,201 --> 01:05:41,570
Are we gonna get back on the boat in the
middle of the night without any gas?

1366
01:05:41,571 --> 01:05:44,538
I wanna call the police.

1367
01:05:44,539 --> 01:05:47,475
You just told me that
there's no cell phone service.

1368
01:05:47,476 --> 01:05:50,611
- You just told me that.
- Can we go someplace where we have service

1369
01:05:50,612 --> 01:05:52,713
- so we can call the police?
- Look, look.

1370
01:05:52,714 --> 01:05:54,647
This place is open.

1371
01:05:54,648 --> 01:05:56,251
This place is open up here.
Let's go in here.

1372
01:05:56,252 --> 01:06:00,587
- Will you look inside...
- Let's just go in here and regroup.

1373
01:06:00,588 --> 01:06:02,190
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, yeah.

1374
01:06:02,191 --> 01:06:03,760
Come on.

1375
01:06:04,760 --> 01:06:07,798
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, shit.

1376
01:06:10,798 --> 01:06:13,600
Um, here.
Let's set this stuff down.

1377
01:06:13,601 --> 01:06:14,702
- Where?
- How is Andrew?

1378
01:06:14,703 --> 01:06:17,638
He's fine.
He's sleeping.

1379
01:06:17,639 --> 01:06:19,110
Well, this
couldn't be creepier.

1380
01:06:22,110 --> 01:06:24,346
- Can we make sure there are no
more dead people in here? - Yes.

1381
01:06:24,347 --> 01:06:26,751
I'll make sure they're not.

1382
01:06:29,751 --> 01:06:31,285
Okay.

1383
01:06:31,286 --> 01:06:32,452
No, this is good.

1384
01:06:32,453 --> 01:06:33,753
This is good.
Let's stay here.

1385
01:06:33,754 --> 01:06:35,287
I'm gonna see if
I can find a landline.

1386
01:06:35,288 --> 01:06:36,590
Maybe I can get one to work.

1387
01:06:36,591 --> 01:06:38,459
Okay.
I'm gonna go out

1388
01:06:38,460 --> 01:06:41,227
and see if I see anyone
on the street at all.

1389
01:06:41,228 --> 01:06:43,800
Cops, something.

1390
01:06:44,800 --> 01:06:46,735
- We'll find 'em.
- Find 'em?

1391
01:06:46,736 --> 01:06:48,669
We'll find 'em.

1392
01:06:48,670 --> 01:06:50,703
Nothing's happened.
We just... we just...

1393
01:06:50,704 --> 01:06:53,406
have some deputies off radio.

1394
01:06:53,407 --> 01:06:55,710
You know, if I find these guys
are playing a joke on me...

1395
01:06:55,711 --> 01:06:57,181
Well, they're fired.

1396
01:06:59,181 --> 01:07:00,713
I've never had this happen.

1397
01:07:00,714 --> 01:07:02,347
There's got to be a reason.

1398
01:07:02,348 --> 01:07:04,719
I'm gonna make the next
town meeting, I can tell you that.

1399
01:07:04,720 --> 01:07:08,288
- We're gonna have to get some...
- Come on, Lee.

1400
01:07:08,289 --> 01:07:10,425
That's the last thing we need right now.

1401
01:07:10,426 --> 01:07:13,259
- What's that?
- Put your seatbelt on.

1402
01:07:13,260 --> 01:07:14,562
Oh, Jesus.

1403
01:07:14,563 --> 01:07:16,733
You're riding in a police car.

1404
01:07:18,733 --> 01:07:21,301
Yeah, I'm worried
about my seat belt.

1405
01:07:21,302 --> 01:07:23,736
That's what I'm
worried about, right?

1406
01:07:23,737 --> 01:07:25,643
Whose car?

1407
01:07:28,643 --> 01:07:30,845
I think that's Jimson's car.

1408
01:07:30,846 --> 01:07:33,682
- I can't be for sure.
- Is that him in the car?

1409
01:07:34,682 --> 01:07:36,716
I don't know.

1410
01:07:36,717 --> 01:07:40,120
- Whose house is this?
- What the hell is he doing, Lee?

1411
01:07:40,121 --> 01:07:41,856
- Now, wait a minute.
- I had to kill 'em.

1412
01:07:41,857 --> 01:07:44,258
That's Jim.

1413
01:07:44,259 --> 01:07:45,494
- What's wrong with him?
- What's wrong with him?

1414
01:07:45,495 --> 01:07:48,629
He looks like
he's done something.

1415
01:07:48,630 --> 01:07:51,165
- Is he drunk?
- He's got his gun out.

1416
01:07:51,166 --> 01:07:54,334
- Go away!
- What's the matter, Jim?

1417
01:07:54,335 --> 01:07:56,739
Come here, buddy!

1418
01:07:57,739 --> 01:07:59,708
Come here!

1419
01:08:00,708 --> 01:08:02,775
Something's
wrong with his face.

1420
01:08:02,776 --> 01:08:05,146
- Oh, God, he's got...
- Oh, Christ.

1421
01:08:05,147 --> 01:08:06,717
- Go away!
- Jim?

1422
01:08:08,717 --> 01:08:09,885
- Go away!
- Come on, Jim.

1423
01:08:09,886 --> 01:08:12,720
- Just chill out, buddy!
- Just go!

1424
01:08:12,721 --> 01:08:14,623
Come on!

1425
01:08:15,623 --> 01:08:17,389
Come on and get
in the back of the car.

1426
01:08:17,390 --> 01:08:18,724
Get in the back
of the car, Jim.

1427
01:08:18,725 --> 01:08:20,626
I'll take you to the hospital.

1428
01:08:20,627 --> 01:08:22,899
- Come on, we'll take you somewhere.
- Just go!

1429
01:08:23,899 --> 01:08:26,469
Come on, bud.

1430
01:08:27,469 --> 01:08:29,637
Don't let me lose you, Jim.
Come on, now.

1431
01:08:29,638 --> 01:08:32,273
We're all gonna die.

1432
01:08:32,274 --> 01:08:34,608
- We're all gonna die.
- Oh, God.

1433
01:08:34,609 --> 01:08:35,875
- I don't wanna die like this.
- It's okay, buddy.

1434
01:08:35,876 --> 01:08:37,746
- I'm coming to get you!
- No, Lee. Lee, stay.

1435
01:08:37,747 --> 01:08:39,913
- No, no, no, no.
- Let him go, Lee.

1436
01:08:39,914 --> 01:08:41,548
No, no, no. We gotta
get him somewhere.

1437
01:08:41,549 --> 01:08:42,850
- You stay here.
- Lee, for God's sake.

1438
01:08:42,851 --> 01:08:45,219
- Jim.
- They're eating my flesh.

1439
01:08:45,220 --> 01:08:46,519
- They're eating everybody's flesh.
- Jim, buddy. Get in the car.

1440
01:08:46,520 --> 01:08:48,756
- Let's go somewhere. Come on.
- We're all gonna die.

1441
01:08:48,757 --> 01:08:51,658
- Come on. Hey, what's that?
- We shouldn't have to die like this.

1442
01:08:51,659 --> 01:08:53,359
Huh?

1443
01:08:53,360 --> 01:08:54,662
No, you're not gonna die.
Nobody's gonna die.

1444
01:08:54,663 --> 01:08:56,429
Get in the car.

1445
01:08:56,430 --> 01:08:57,496
You don't have
to die like this, sir.

1446
01:08:57,497 --> 01:08:58,966
I can't touch you,
but get in the car.

1447
01:08:58,967 --> 01:09:00,667
Jim, now, wait a minute.

1448
01:09:00,668 --> 01:09:02,432
No, Deputy!
Put that gun down!

1449
01:09:31,432 --> 01:09:32,932
Bill, just hang on
for a second.

1450
01:09:33,001 --> 01:09:34,734
I'm gonna go and get Alex.

1451
01:09:34,735 --> 01:09:36,237
Okay?
Don't go anywhere.

1452
01:09:36,238 --> 01:09:39,273
Alex. Alex?

1453
01:09:39,274 --> 01:09:41,345
I got Bill on the Skype.

1454
01:09:43,345 --> 01:09:45,646
- Bill, can you hear me?
- Yeah, what's going on?

1455
01:09:45,647 --> 01:09:47,680
Okay, we came to Claridge

1456
01:09:47,681 --> 01:09:49,249
to meet up with my parents.

1457
01:09:49,250 --> 01:09:52,452
- And, um...
- Where are you, at an antique store or something?

1458
01:09:52,453 --> 01:09:53,755
There are these...
there are dead bodies

1459
01:09:53,756 --> 01:09:55,755
- everywhere, Bill.
- What?

1460
01:09:55,756 --> 01:09:57,858
- And...
- Bill, the entire town is covered

1461
01:09:57,859 --> 01:10:00,326
- in dead fucking bodies.
- Oh, yeah. Okay.

1462
01:10:00,327 --> 01:10:01,693
That's a good one.
All right.

1463
01:10:01,694 --> 01:10:03,765
- Bill, please!
- What, are you guys serious?

1464
01:10:03,766 --> 01:10:06,300
Yeah, we are entirely
fucking serious here, Bill.

1465
01:10:06,301 --> 01:10:08,602
Oh, okay.
Call the cops, guys.

1466
01:10:08,603 --> 01:10:10,803
No, we called the cops.
We can't get through to them.

1467
01:10:10,804 --> 01:10:12,504
We can't get through
to my parents.

1468
01:10:12,505 --> 01:10:14,376
Our cell phones aren't working.
We can't get service.

1469
01:10:14,377 --> 01:10:16,777
We need for
you to do something.

1470
01:10:16,778 --> 01:10:18,545
Okay, all right.
Where are you?

1471
01:10:18,546 --> 01:10:19,846
Claridge.

1472
01:10:19,847 --> 01:10:21,681
- Claridge?
- Claridge.

1473
01:10:21,682 --> 01:10:22,749
In Maryland, for God's sake.

1474
01:10:22,750 --> 01:10:24,851
- Call somebody, anybody.
- All right, hey.

1475
01:10:24,852 --> 01:10:26,318
Just get us
some help here, please.

1476
01:10:26,319 --> 01:10:27,689
Tell me, what happened to you?

1477
01:10:27,690 --> 01:10:29,355
We don't know what happened.

1478
01:10:29,356 --> 01:10:32,328
I mean, what is that
on your neck?

1479
01:10:34,328 --> 01:10:36,397
What's on my neck?

1480
01:10:36,398 --> 01:10:38,701
- Oh, my God, Alex.
- What is it?

1481
01:10:39,701 --> 01:10:41,645
Oh, holy shit.

1482
01:10:51,645 --> 01:10:54,447
My name is
Dr. Jack Abrams.

1483
01:10:54,448 --> 01:10:56,983
I am a physician
at the Atlantic Hospital

1484
01:10:56,984 --> 01:10:58,625
in Maryland.

1485
01:11:03,625 --> 01:11:06,359
I'm making this video
in the hope that

1486
01:11:06,360 --> 01:11:09,362
I will be able to watch it
at some point in the future,

1487
01:11:09,363 --> 01:11:12,433
and I'm gonna show the world
what happened here.

1488
01:11:12,434 --> 01:11:14,867
Uh, coming out
into the hall now...

1489
01:11:14,868 --> 01:11:17,408
I locked myself
in the ICU for...

1490
01:11:21,408 --> 01:11:23,676
The CDC stopped
taking my phone calls.

1491
01:11:23,677 --> 01:11:25,349
Contacted FEMA.
Help hasn't arrived.

1492
01:11:27,349 --> 01:11:31,719
I think I now know
what is killing people.

1493
01:11:31,720 --> 01:11:33,720
We were looking
for some kind of virus,

1494
01:11:33,721 --> 01:11:35,521
some kind of viral outbreak.

1495
01:11:35,522 --> 01:11:37,958
And when we called CDC,
they needed to send

1496
01:11:37,959 --> 01:11:42,395
a fucking army down here to put
some goddamn minds together

1497
01:11:42,396 --> 01:11:44,430
to find what I know now,

1498
01:11:44,431 --> 01:11:46,732
which is this is not a virus.
This is an organism.

1499
01:11:46,733 --> 01:11:48,634
It is an organism
that has somehow

1500
01:11:48,635 --> 01:11:50,404
infiltrated these
people's bodies.

1501
01:11:50,405 --> 01:11:53,139
The blistering...
that's a symptom.

1502
01:11:53,140 --> 01:11:55,075
It is not...

1503
01:11:55,076 --> 01:11:58,778
that is what...
that is what threw us off.

1504
01:11:58,779 --> 01:12:01,482
It is the isopod.

1505
01:12:01,483 --> 01:12:03,617
It's eating their organs.

1506
01:12:03,618 --> 01:12:07,653
It's... it's... it's literally
eating them from the inside.

1507
01:12:07,654 --> 01:12:09,656
It is eating their intestines,

1508
01:12:09,657 --> 01:12:11,960
it is eating their liver.
It goes for kidneys,

1509
01:12:11,961 --> 01:12:14,428
lungs, tissue.

1510
01:12:14,429 --> 01:12:18,532
This is a rapidly growing,
accelerating organism.

1511
01:12:18,533 --> 01:12:21,602
How it's growing this fast,
I have no idea.

1512
01:12:21,603 --> 01:12:24,810
Um, I noticed this rash
about 45 minutes ago.

1513
01:12:28,810 --> 01:12:31,944
And I'm gonna continue
to take the camera

1514
01:12:31,945 --> 01:12:36,450
and I'm gonna document
everything that I see here.

1515
01:12:36,451 --> 01:12:38,986
If you find this tape,
just please get it out.

1516
01:12:41,055 --> 01:12:42,993
Get it out.

1517
01:13:32,774 --> 01:13:35,175
Alex? Alex, Jesus!

1518
01:13:35,176 --> 01:13:36,675
- Alex?
- Stephanie, would you please talk to me?

1519
01:13:36,676 --> 01:13:38,179
- What's happening?
- What's wrong?

1520
01:13:38,180 --> 01:13:39,779
Talk to me.
What's wrong?

1521
01:13:39,780 --> 01:13:41,814
- Alex?
- There's something crawling

1522
01:13:41,815 --> 01:13:43,916
inside of my stomach.

1523
01:13:43,917 --> 01:13:47,153
Alex.

1524
01:13:47,154 --> 01:13:48,789
Please explain
to me what's going on.

1525
01:13:48,790 --> 01:13:51,558
Okay.

1526
01:13:51,559 --> 01:13:53,528
- They're coming, they're coming.
- I can't...

1527
01:13:53,529 --> 01:13:56,697
They're gonna come.
Help is here, okay?

1528
01:13:56,698 --> 01:13:58,666
You're okay.
You're gonna be fine.

1529
01:13:58,667 --> 01:14:00,600
- It hurts.
- I know, darling.

1530
01:14:00,601 --> 01:14:02,036
I know it hurts,
but we gotta get you outside.

1531
01:14:02,037 --> 01:14:03,708
No!

1532
01:14:07,708 --> 01:14:10,813
I'm in too much pain.
I can't handle it.

1533
01:14:11,813 --> 01:14:15,782
- Alex... no.
- Take it, take it!

1534
01:14:15,783 --> 01:14:17,617
What's wrong with you?
Come on!

1535
01:14:17,618 --> 01:14:22,656
- Please. It's too much.
- No.

1536
01:14:22,657 --> 01:14:24,925
- Help me.
- Alex, come on.

1537
01:14:24,926 --> 01:14:27,051
Help.
Finish...

1538
01:14:51,820 --> 01:14:55,788
Alex died at 1:26 AM.

1539
01:14:55,789 --> 01:14:57,656
The larvae he swallowed
in the bay

1540
01:14:57,657 --> 01:14:59,028
had grown into
a full-sized parasite

1541
01:15:00,028 --> 01:15:02,929
in eight hours
from the toxic soup.

1542
01:15:07,034 --> 01:15:09,337
Hi, this is Steve Slattery
over at Homeland Security.

1543
01:15:09,338 --> 01:15:10,837
I just wanted
to get back to you

1544
01:15:10,838 --> 01:15:13,708
on that message
about Chesapeake Bay.

1545
01:15:14,708 --> 01:15:15,943
Yeah? And?

1546
01:15:15,944 --> 01:15:18,211
Yeah, uh... turns out

1547
01:15:18,212 --> 01:15:20,346
we did hear something
a few weeks back

1548
01:15:20,347 --> 01:15:21,849
about a couple divers' bodies

1549
01:15:21,850 --> 01:15:24,751
being found in the water.
Natural Resources Police

1550
01:15:24,752 --> 01:15:26,687
thought it was
a bull shark bite.

1551
01:15:26,688 --> 01:15:29,755
And they were getting ready
to pull people out of the water

1552
01:15:29,756 --> 01:15:31,125
and put up a shark alert,

1553
01:15:31,126 --> 01:15:33,827
but a medical examiner
determined

1554
01:15:33,828 --> 01:15:36,729
that it was not
a shark bite at all.

1555
01:15:36,730 --> 01:15:38,198
What was it?

1556
01:15:38,199 --> 01:15:40,867
They weren't sure, so they
sent reports over to us,

1557
01:15:40,868 --> 01:15:43,804
and then we sent them over
to the Coast Guard

1558
01:15:43,805 --> 01:15:45,604
and they said it didn't make
any sense to them,

1559
01:15:45,605 --> 01:15:47,673
so then we sent it to FEMA
and they never responded,

1560
01:15:47,674 --> 01:15:49,109
so I figured
we'd send it to you.

1561
01:15:49,110 --> 01:15:51,047
Yeah, that's good.

1562
01:15:54,047 --> 01:15:55,716
What did the report say?

1563
01:15:55,717 --> 01:15:58,751
Well, uh...

1564
01:15:58,752 --> 01:16:01,154
kinda strange stuff.
It said the cause of death was

1565
01:16:01,155 --> 01:16:06,326
"undetermined due
to a multiplicity of parasites

1566
01:16:06,327 --> 01:16:09,261
and a variety of infections."

1567
01:16:09,262 --> 01:16:11,064
Do you want a copy
of this report?

1568
01:16:11,065 --> 01:16:12,765
Oh, yeah.

1569
01:16:12,766 --> 01:16:14,206
Funny enough, I would love to
see a copy of that report.

1570
01:16:18,206 --> 01:16:20,206
Here we are, baby.

1571
01:16:21,009 --> 01:16:22,944
So let me get this straight.

1572
01:16:22,945 --> 01:16:26,179
Two divers are found
with a bunch of holes in them

1573
01:16:26,180 --> 01:16:29,649
and all that we know is that
they're mysteriously being eaten

1574
01:16:29,650 --> 01:16:31,049
by parasites and infections.

1575
01:16:31,050 --> 01:16:32,520
That's right.

1576
01:16:32,521 --> 01:16:35,822
Nobody knows what
happened and it takes 16 days

1577
01:16:35,823 --> 01:16:38,258
to get this information to us?

1578
01:16:38,259 --> 01:16:40,760
Listen, we set
up an incident center

1579
01:16:40,761 --> 01:16:42,764
without cause and we're
in deep doo-doo here.

1580
01:16:42,765 --> 01:16:45,698
Really? Well, I've got
a town full of dead bodies.

1581
01:16:45,699 --> 01:16:47,366
A small town.
I think we need to

1582
01:16:47,367 --> 01:16:49,335
keep this whole thing
in perspective here.

1583
01:16:49,336 --> 01:16:51,706
What kind of perspective
are you talking about?

1584
01:16:54,676 --> 01:16:55,842
Help me! Help me!

1585
01:16:55,843 --> 01:16:57,844
Get off of me!

1586
01:16:57,845 --> 01:16:59,751
Get off of me!

1587
01:17:08,922 --> 01:17:12,425
Listen, it's not that easy to
pull the trigger on something like this.

1588
01:17:12,426 --> 01:17:14,694
We...

1589
01:17:14,695 --> 01:17:17,764
we blow up a nonissue and shut
down the entire Chesapeake Bay...

1590
01:17:17,765 --> 01:17:21,367
I mean, we're talking about beaches,
restaurants, vacation fishing.

1591
01:17:21,368 --> 01:17:25,471
The public panics if word gets out
we're setting up an incident center

1592
01:17:25,472 --> 01:17:27,908
about a spreading disease
or for a spreading disease.

1593
01:17:27,909 --> 01:17:30,844
You don't just shut down the
Eastern Seaboard without approval

1594
01:17:30,845 --> 01:17:32,411
from a higher authority.

1595
01:17:32,412 --> 01:17:36,049
Great, I understand. Thank you
very much, Officer Slattery.

1596
01:17:36,050 --> 01:17:37,783
That's it?

1597
01:17:37,784 --> 01:17:40,006
Okay.
Thanks.

1598
01:18:00,006 --> 01:18:03,376
Um, then at about 5:30,

1599
01:18:03,377 --> 01:18:05,111
they came in the hazmat suits,

1600
01:18:05,112 --> 01:18:06,414
and the National Guard came,

1601
01:18:06,415 --> 01:18:09,381
and then they quarantined
the town for another three days

1602
01:18:09,382 --> 01:18:11,818
and that was when they
confiscated

1603
01:18:11,819 --> 01:18:13,261
every single camera
they could find.

1604
01:18:21,261 --> 01:18:24,464
You know, there were
those who survived,

1605
01:18:24,465 --> 01:18:27,867
and for some reason,
they never became sick.

1606
01:18:27,868 --> 01:18:29,368
Uh, the town as a whole

1607
01:18:29,369 --> 01:18:32,906
reached a financial agreement
with the government.

1608
01:18:32,907 --> 01:18:35,442
I don't know how much
money changed hands,

1609
01:18:35,443 --> 01:18:38,046
but I do know that silence
was part of the agreement.

1610
01:18:40,046 --> 01:18:42,415
I tried to reach out
to people like Stephanie,

1611
01:18:42,416 --> 01:18:45,161
but she didn't want to
participate in this film.

1612
01:18:53,161 --> 01:18:54,493
Oh, and by the way.

1613
01:18:54,494 --> 01:18:56,830
The official line
from the government

1614
01:18:56,831 --> 01:18:58,497
was that the outbreak
was due to

1615
01:18:58,498 --> 01:19:01,837
unseasonably high
water temperatures.

1616
01:19:02,837 --> 01:19:04,871
This is Donna Thompson...

1617
01:19:04,872 --> 01:19:06,939
signing off.
