1
00:04:30,808 --> 00:04:35,187
You can see your sister 
in a moment.

2
00:04:38,357 --> 00:04:45,031
Hello, I need to speak with Mr. Drake. 
I'm Samantha Winston.

3
00:04:45,781 --> 00:04:49,118
- Samantha Winston? 
- Yes.

4
00:04:50,828 --> 00:04:55,207
Here you go take a seat, 
and I'll see if he has time.

5
00:05:15,728 --> 00:05:19,231
Ms. Johansen, you can go in now.

6
00:05:34,997 --> 00:05:37,666
<I> Ms. Winston. </i>

7
00:05:38,876 --> 00:05:41,045
Ms. Winston!

8
00:05:41,796 --> 00:05:46,175
- Yes. 
- Mr Drake can see you now. Follow me.

9
00:06:04,944 --> 00:06:08,364
I can poor believe my eyes. 
Samantha Winston.

10
00:06:09,114 --> 00:06:13,035
Hello.

11
00:06:13,994 --> 00:06:18,499
Come in. Sit down.

12
00:06:21,669 --> 00:06:25,839
Think that you remember me.

13
00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:30,636
- How are you? 
- I feel good.

14
00:06:31,387 --> 00:06:35,599
- Where do you live? 
- At a motel.

15
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:39,478
You know, I've tried to find you 
over the years.

16
00:06:40,229 --> 00:06:44,233
But you said you were moved 
to Minnesota with your aunt.

17
00:06:44,984 --> 00:06:46,944
Yes ...

18
00:06:47,695 --> 00:06:51,115
What are you doing here?

19
00:06:53,367 --> 00:06:58,956
- I need a job. 
- A job?

20
00:07:05,671 --> 00:07:07,923
- Harriet? 
- Yes.

21
00:07:08,674 --> 00:07:11,969
Want to ask a desk 
to Ms. Winston outside my office.

22
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,139
She will be responsible for new customers.

23
00:07:15,889 --> 00:07:19,351
- Yes. 
- Thank you.

24
00:07:21,061 --> 00:07:25,649
- Can you start tomorrow? 
- Yes. Thank you.

25
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:30,612
Well, Harriet shows you 
what to do.

26
00:07:31,363 --> 00:07:33,240
There is a lot of paperwork.

27
00:07:33,991 --> 00:07:38,912
You need not worry about other sides 
of the business.

28
00:07:39,663 --> 00:07:45,961
I hate to sound morbid, 
but it goes well, we have 31 offices.

29
00:07:46,712 --> 00:07:51,633
- It's great, Mr. Drake. 
- My father was Mr. Drake.

30
00:07:53,010 --> 00:07:57,598
I'm Lucas. Call me Lucas.

31
00:08:25,626 --> 00:08:29,713
Mom, this is gonna Jack get paid.

32
00:09:13,757 --> 00:09:16,134
Sheep.

33
00:09:20,973 --> 00:09:22,516
Sheep!

34
00:09:33,777 --> 00:09:36,822
Who are you?

35
00:09:38,365 --> 00:09:40,826
What will you?

36
00:09:47,207 --> 00:09:48,458
Is it ...

37
00:09:49,209 --> 00:09:52,504
Is Samantha?

38
00:09:55,299 --> 00:09:57,759
Samantha!

39
00:09:58,510 --> 00:10:01,888
My God, Sammy, is that you?

40
00:10:03,432 --> 00:10:06,768
I've been looking for you.

41
00:10:10,647 --> 00:10:13,734
I ... no, sorry.

42
00:10:15,485 --> 00:10:19,740
I ... I searched for you. 
When Patricia died ...

43
00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:24,036
- Why did not you tell me? 
- You were eight ...

44
00:10:24,786 --> 00:10:30,834
And lived far from here. 
You stayed with a family ...

45
00:10:31,752 --> 00:10:36,506
It was better than an alcoholic, 
like me.

46
00:10:37,466 --> 00:10:43,180
Come on, honey, let's go inside.

47
00:10:44,181 --> 00:10:48,143
We can not talk here. 
Please.

48
00:10:51,855 --> 00:10:56,401
Come in, I have milk and cookies.

49
00:10:57,277 --> 00:11:01,531
Here, sit down.

50
00:11:08,246 --> 00:11:11,666
Look around the house, 
if you like.

51
00:11:12,417 --> 00:11:16,004
You can look at the pictures, 
or go upstairs if you want.

52
00:11:16,755 --> 00:11:21,968
It's beautiful photos. 
Your mother was a beautiful woman.

53
00:11:37,317 --> 00:11:40,612
I'm sorry, she passed away.

54
00:11:43,156 --> 00:11:46,785
She loved you dearly.

55
00:11:48,161 --> 00:11:51,206
How.

56
00:11:57,379 --> 00:11:59,256
Just look.

57
00:12:00,006 --> 00:12:02,342
Yes.

58
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:10,767
Here ...

59
00:12:14,062 --> 00:12:18,233
Sit down, sit down and eat.

60
00:12:20,151 --> 00:12:24,781
Mother would kill me if I did not 
you food, she was so worried.

61
00:12:25,532 --> 00:12:28,952
Here.

62
00:12:31,788 --> 00:12:36,293
We have so much to talk about.

63
00:12:40,463 --> 00:12:44,301
I wish you could be.

64
00:12:48,930 --> 00:12:52,142
I do not drink anymore.

65
00:12:53,310 --> 00:12:56,771
I try to do something good 
for people.

66
00:12:58,607 --> 00:13:01,318
I would like to make amends, 
if you let me do it.

67
00:13:03,486 --> 00:13:07,741
- How's your health that? 
- I'm sober.

68
00:13:08,491 --> 00:13:12,704
I have not drunk for years, 
I will not even smell it.

69
00:13:13,455 --> 00:13:17,667
What about you? 
Where have you been all this time?

70
00:13:18,918 --> 00:13:22,422
I stayed with some foster families, 
for Aunt Patricia died.

71
00:13:23,173 --> 00:13:26,259
They did not like me, 
so it did not.

72
00:13:27,010 --> 00:13:31,431
I ran away when I was 16, 
and now I'm here.

73
00:13:35,226 --> 00:13:39,731
- I'm tired. 
- Let me show you your room.

74
00:13:43,610 --> 00:13:47,405
Your room, my friend, 
exactly as you left it.

75
00:14:28,238 --> 00:14:32,992
- It's late, I have to go. 
- Are you going already?

76
00:14:33,743 --> 00:14:40,041
- I just wanted to see the house. 
- How about a cup of tea?

77
00:14:44,379 --> 00:14:46,005
Well.

78
00:14:46,756 --> 00:14:51,761
- Do you like oranges? 
- Not really.

79
00:14:54,347 --> 00:14:59,727
Should I make some eggs for you?

80
00:15:00,478 --> 00:15:06,359
I just bought a new frying pan. 
Like them on TV.

81
00:15:12,574 --> 00:15:15,118
I ...

82
00:15:15,869 --> 00:15:20,748
I try to say that I will 
be happy if you will.

83
00:15:21,499 --> 00:15:26,170
Although it is only a few days.

84
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:39,726
I do not want any food.

85
00:15:41,561 --> 00:15:45,440
I will be some day.

86
00:15:46,190 --> 00:15:51,487
I have a clean pajamas for you.

87
00:15:52,530 --> 00:15:56,367
My stuff is at the motel, 
I do not need a pajama.

88
00:16:12,634 --> 00:16:16,971
Are you telling me about mom tomorrow? 
I do not remember much.

89
00:16:18,598 --> 00:16:24,228
Your mother loved you dearly, 
we're talking about it, I promise.

90
00:16:26,856 --> 00:16:30,485
I put the key in the door 
underneath.

91
00:16:31,235 --> 00:16:34,530
Should I turn off the light in the hallway?

92
00:16:35,281 --> 00:16:40,203
- No, that's fine, goodnight. 
- Well, good night.

93
00:17:16,447 --> 00:17:18,825
Jack?

94
00:17:23,746 --> 00:17:26,124
Jack, is that you?

95
00:18:09,417 --> 00:18:11,127
- Hello. 
- Hello.

96
00:18:11,878 --> 00:18:14,922
- What do you think about your first day? 
- It's fine.

97
00:18:15,673 --> 00:18:19,135
Well, you know, I have a guest house, 
you can stay in.

98
00:18:19,886 --> 00:18:24,515
- It's probably nicer to live in. 
- I'm staying with Jack.

99
00:18:25,266 --> 00:18:28,728
- Jack? 
- He saw me looking in through the window.

100
00:18:29,478 --> 00:18:32,815
- I will be there some day. 
​​ - I see.

101
00:18:33,566 --> 00:18:38,321
Do you want to come and eat with us tonight, 
I can help you remember Jen.

102
00:18:39,071 --> 00:18:42,783
- It will be great. 
- Good. I have something for you.

103
00:18:43,534 --> 00:18:50,708
Your first working mobile phone. 
​​Use it wisely.

104
00:19:08,142 --> 00:19:12,605
- I enjoyed meeting your kids. 
- They liked you.

105
00:19:13,356 --> 00:19:19,654
I know this because Tatiana never 
invite anyone into his room.

106
00:19:20,404 --> 00:19:26,410
- Where is your wife? She coming soon? 
- No, we're divorced.

107
00:19:27,161 --> 00:19:31,248
She lives in France with his new 
billionaire husband.

108
00:19:31,999 --> 00:19:36,170
The children are adopted. We love them 
both like mad.

109
00:19:36,921 --> 00:19:40,925
But ... they speak French now, 
for they live in both places.

110
00:19:41,676 --> 00:19:45,846
- Great. 
- Yes, it is good for them.

111
00:19:46,597 --> 00:19:51,519
Let me ask you something, 
promise me not to get angry.

112
00:19:52,269 --> 00:19:59,193
Do you really stay in your old house? 
I do not think it's good for you.

113
00:20:00,277 --> 00:20:02,571
It is fine.

114
00:20:03,322 --> 00:20:05,658
It's alright.

115
00:20:06,409 --> 00:20:10,079
You remember it enough not know you were little, 
but I knew your mother well.

116
00:20:10,830 --> 00:20:14,625
We were really close friends.

117
00:20:15,376 --> 00:20:18,921
And I loved her.

118
00:20:20,089 --> 00:20:23,175
She was an unhappy man.

119
00:20:28,389 --> 00:20:31,809
But she lived for you.

120
00:20:33,018 --> 00:20:35,563
She adored you.

121
00:20:36,313 --> 00:20:39,567
I remember how she smiled, 
when you were with us.

122
00:20:40,317 --> 00:20:44,822
- I have never forgotten you. 
- Is it true?

123
00:20:47,032 --> 00:20:50,828
This I must say.

124
00:20:51,579 --> 00:20:56,125
Can you hear Tatiana? 
She is something of a musician.

125
00:20:56,876 --> 00:21:02,339
Let me play something for you, 
we wrote together.

126
00:21:04,717 --> 00:21:07,178
We are still working on it.

127
00:21:07,928 --> 00:21:13,767
She found the song, 
the text is mine.

128
00:21:15,352 --> 00:21:18,522
And I whistles.

129
00:21:23,944 --> 00:21:26,447
It is a lullaby.

130
00:22:15,955 --> 00:22:19,541
- Should I stop? 
- Can I say goodnight to Tatiana?

131
00:22:20,292 --> 00:22:25,422
Yes, do it, otherwise fall she never 
asleep.

132
00:22:28,550 --> 00:22:32,972
- I really enjoyed myself with you. 
- I'm with.

133
00:22:33,722 --> 00:22:36,517
Will you come and live here?

134
00:22:37,267 --> 00:22:39,353
I have to go home.

135
00:22:40,104 --> 00:22:43,732
I like your bear, 
it's cute.

136
00:22:44,483 --> 00:22:49,488
- Do you live here with your mother and father? 
- I live with my father for the time.

137
00:22:50,239 --> 00:22:53,701
- And your mother? 
- No.

138
00:22:54,451 --> 00:22:57,287
Where is your mother?

139
00:22:58,038 --> 00:23:00,207
She is ...

140
00:23:00,958 --> 00:23:03,919
She is in heaven.

141
00:23:04,670 --> 00:23:09,842
- Do you miss her? 
- Every day.

142
00:23:11,427 --> 00:23:14,471
Have you invited Samantha to my 
birthday?

143
00:23:15,222 --> 00:23:18,183
It would be fine if you can 
come.

144
00:23:18,934 --> 00:23:24,523
- Sounds great, how old are you? 
-14.

145
00:23:26,650 --> 00:23:29,987
I have to go home, look now to get some rest.

146
00:23:30,738 --> 00:23:37,411
- Come and see us soon again. 
- I'll.

147
00:23:39,830 --> 00:23:42,124
You're a good father.

148
00:23:42,875 --> 00:23:46,587
- They are happy kids. 
- I hope so.

149
00:23:47,337 --> 00:23:50,841
What about you? Are you happy?

150
00:23:53,802 --> 00:23:57,139
Hyggede you feel at least tonight?

151
00:24:00,017 --> 00:24:03,103
I think he killed her.

152
00:24:04,062 --> 00:24:06,565
Jack.

153
00:24:07,316 --> 00:24:10,777
I think he killed my mother.

154
00:24:12,488 --> 00:24:18,118
I came to find the truth, 
I was looking on the net, there's nothing.

155
00:24:20,204 --> 00:24:26,084
Honestly, I have sometimes been wanting 
to beat Jack to death.

156
00:24:27,794 --> 00:24:30,964
But I did not have any evidence.

157
00:24:31,715 --> 00:24:34,885
So I let go of it.

158
00:24:35,636 --> 00:24:41,892
- We must let go of it. 
- Let go?

159
00:24:43,143 --> 00:24:46,063
I can not even sleep.

160
00:24:46,813 --> 00:24:49,274
And when I do, 
I dream things.

161
00:24:50,025 --> 00:24:56,198
I see her, and I'm trying 
to reach for her.

162
00:24:57,324 --> 00:25:03,580
- And she's gone. 
​​- Breathe, you must breathe.

163
00:25:04,623 --> 00:25:09,836
I'll get a little cold water to you.

164
00:25:11,046 --> 00:25:14,424
Take it easy.

165
00:26:04,808 --> 00:26:09,062
Hey, calm down.

166
00:26:10,647 --> 00:26:14,901
Come on, I have some water for you.

167
00:26:15,944 --> 00:26:20,115
Sit there and drink some water.

168
00:26:20,866 --> 00:26:24,703
Here, drink a little.

169
00:26:25,996 --> 00:26:30,125
How deep breath.

170
00:26:31,084 --> 00:26:32,919
- Is that better? 
- Yes, fine, thank you.

171
00:26:33,670 --> 00:26:37,632
Sorry, I get a little nervous 
sometimes.

172
00:26:38,383 --> 00:26:41,762
- I do not know why. 
- It does not matter.

173
00:26:42,512 --> 00:26:46,516
Want to talk about your aunt Patricia? 
I did not know her.

174
00:26:47,267 --> 00:26:52,731
Yes. She was beautiful.

175
00:26:53,482 --> 00:26:58,236
She had no other. 
She also missed mother.

176
00:26:58,987 --> 00:27:04,743
She was the only one who understood me.

177
00:27:05,952 --> 00:27:09,789
It was a car accident. The police came 
to pick me up at school.

178
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:14,336
They drove me to the hospital.

179
00:27:15,086 --> 00:27:19,466
I was with her, 
I begged her not to die.

180
00:27:20,217 --> 00:27:23,845
But ... she did.

181
00:27:24,596 --> 00:27:29,643
It felt like my life was taken 
from me again.

182
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:35,357
But she hated my father.

183
00:27:36,107 --> 00:27:39,361
Jack is much older than your mother.

184
00:27:40,111 --> 00:27:45,325
He was never good enough for her.

185
00:27:46,076 --> 00:27:49,955
But I have always seen him as a harmless, 
it was just talk.

186
00:27:50,705 --> 00:27:55,001
I have never believed that he was 
involved in her so-called accident.

187
00:27:55,752 --> 00:27:57,587
Accident?

188
00:27:58,338 --> 00:28:01,466
It is said that she hit her head 
against the bathtub.

189
00:28:02,217 --> 00:28:04,594
Sam, honey.

190
00:28:05,345 --> 00:28:10,141
Dr. Kaplan came and tried to revive 
her.

191
00:28:10,892 --> 00:28:13,228
No one knew the details.

192
00:28:13,979 --> 00:28:20,026
But your aunt, Patricia, 
was sure that it was your father.

193
00:28:21,319 --> 00:28:25,156
- She was cremated soon after. 
- Was she cremated?

194
00:28:25,907 --> 00:28:29,953
Yes, people came and saw her, 
and then she was cremated soon after.

195
00:28:30,704 --> 00:28:35,667
- You knew that appear not. 
- No, I did not.

196
00:28:38,336 --> 00:28:41,214
Where can I find dr. Kaplan?

197
00:28:41,965 --> 00:28:48,972
Last I heard something about him, 
he was in a nursing home.

198
00:28:49,723 --> 00:28:53,309
He suffers from dementia.

199
00:28:56,730 --> 00:29:00,442
Sam ... Sam!

200
00:29:04,988 --> 00:29:08,491
What if the doctor knows the truth?

201
00:29:09,242 --> 00:29:11,995
What if he knows something was wrong?

202
00:29:12,746 --> 00:29:15,165
He declared her dead in the bathtub.

203
00:29:15,915 --> 00:29:21,421
He was court physician in this town for 30 years 
and highly respected.

204
00:29:22,172 --> 00:29:25,633
He was quite sure that your mother 
had been dead long.

205
00:29:26,384 --> 00:29:31,848
- And? 
- And Jack was full all the time.

206
00:29:32,599 --> 00:29:38,521
He was full that night. 
So nobody knows what the hell happened.

207
00:29:40,064 --> 00:29:44,986
- Did she in the bath? 
- Yes.

208
00:29:46,404 --> 00:29:50,492
No ... No, I can remember ...

209
00:29:51,910 --> 00:29:57,040
Mother was lying in bed when she died.

210
00:29:57,791 --> 00:30:02,003
- I was little, but I remember ... 
- No, you're wrong.

211
00:30:02,754 --> 00:30:07,926
You do not know anything about that night. 
I mean it.

212
00:30:08,927 --> 00:30:12,597
You do not.

213
00:30:16,392 --> 00:30:19,145
Jack?

214
00:30:26,819 --> 00:30:29,239
I thought I heard you coming.

215
00:30:29,989 --> 00:30:34,244
I made dinner for you, I was hoping 
that you came home.

216
00:30:34,994 --> 00:30:39,832
I ate with my boss and his 
family. Are the windows closed?

217
00:30:40,583 --> 00:30:45,588
Now I see. 
I did not know you had a job.

218
00:30:46,339 --> 00:30:51,052
I work for Lucas Drake.

219
00:30:51,803 --> 00:30:56,933
Lucas Drake? 
Our competitor, our enemy.

220
00:30:57,684 --> 00:31:02,897
Oh, dear, my goodness, the bandit.

221
00:31:03,648 --> 00:31:08,528
He is an impostor, he asked even 
up to the Senate.

222
00:31:09,279 --> 00:31:14,033
You sold funeral firm for ten years 
ago and I needed a job.

223
00:31:14,784 --> 00:31:18,079
Yes of course.

224
00:31:19,038 --> 00:31:21,666
Of course, honey.

225
00:31:22,417 --> 00:31:25,503
What a beautiful pajamas.

226
00:31:26,254 --> 00:31:31,884
I was just worried about you. 
Because you were out so late.

227
00:31:33,177 --> 00:31:37,056
I am tired, I want to sleep.

228
00:31:37,807 --> 00:31:41,185
- Good night, sweetheart. 
- Good night.

229
00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:49,152
Sleep well.

230
00:31:50,236 --> 00:31:53,239
I love you.

231
00:32:03,374 --> 00:32:05,918
Hello?

232
00:32:06,669 --> 00:32:10,298
- Can I help? 
- Yes, we must talk with Mr. Drake.

233
00:32:11,049 --> 00:32:15,636
- He knows we are coming. 
- What is the name?

234
00:32:18,848 --> 00:32:24,979
Good morning, I'm Benny Dawson, 
this is my nephew Liam, and you are?

235
00:32:25,730 --> 00:32:32,403
- I'm Samantha. 
- Samantha. Nice to meet you.

236
00:32:34,572 --> 00:32:41,037
- I'll give him the message that you are here. 
- Do it. He's waiting for us.

237
00:32:46,042 --> 00:32:50,088
Gentlemen. Good morning.

238
00:32:51,005 --> 00:32:54,509
And good morning to you.

239
00:33:00,097 --> 00:33:01,808
I do not run. 
- I love lunch.

240
00:33:02,558 --> 00:33:08,105
- You have an appointment in 20 minutes. 
- It is doing you.

241
00:33:08,856 --> 00:33:11,859
I am sorry if we ruined 
planning.

242
00:33:12,610 --> 00:33:15,446
- Maybe Samantha with? 
- No, she is busy.

243
00:33:16,197 --> 00:33:19,784
- Come on, I'm hungry. 
- Well, next time.

244
00:33:20,535 --> 00:33:25,122
Benny, come on.

245
00:36:06,033 --> 00:36:11,664
I never lost faith that a 
day would come and find me.

246
00:36:12,873 --> 00:36:15,918
And you did.

247
00:36:22,216 --> 00:36:25,553
What happened to the mother?

248
00:36:27,388 --> 00:36:31,183
Do not you remember anything?

249
00:36:33,644 --> 00:36:39,233
Only her beautiful soft skin 
and her stuff.

250
00:36:41,277 --> 00:36:46,740
Now that I'm here, 
I feel sometimes her scent.

251
00:36:48,826 --> 00:36:51,829
That's all.

252
00:36:59,712 --> 00:37:02,965
How did she die?

253
00:37:07,553 --> 00:37:12,516
The doctor said the mother had stomach cramps 
and high fever.

254
00:37:13,267 --> 00:37:19,398
It ... It was like an abortion.

255
00:37:20,858 --> 00:37:25,779
- Was the mother pregnant? 
- Yes, she was.

256
00:37:26,530 --> 00:37:29,617
- How far along was she? 
- I do not know.

257
00:37:30,367 --> 00:37:34,246
How can you avoid knowing it?

258
00:37:39,543 --> 00:37:42,838
I was different then.

259
00:37:43,589 --> 00:37:48,010
You can ask me anything, 
what you want about your mother.

260
00:37:48,761 --> 00:37:56,226
But I beg you, do not talk with others 
about it.

261
00:38:02,358 --> 00:38:08,572
There were some bad complications 
with pregnancy.

262
00:38:10,115 --> 00:38:13,952
I was too drunk to help.

263
00:38:15,329 --> 00:38:21,251
You destroy this family!

264
00:38:27,674 --> 00:38:33,764
Was it dr. Kaplan, who told you 
about complications?

265
00:38:43,524 --> 00:38:48,904
I do not feel so good, 
I must to bed.

266
00:38:54,118 --> 00:38:56,537
Of course not.

267
00:39:07,005 --> 00:39:09,758
Mr Drake is not here today.

268
00:39:10,509 --> 00:39:13,095
I came to talk to you.

269
00:39:13,846 --> 00:39:19,643
- Me? 
- Yes, you will eat an early dinner?

270
00:39:23,522 --> 00:39:26,150
It is just down the street.

271
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:32,114
- I'm sorry, what was your name again? 
- Liam Dawson.

272
00:39:36,618 --> 00:39:39,288
Well then ...

273
00:39:42,833 --> 00:39:46,044
Yes, Mr. Dawson, let me take my coat.

274
00:39:47,796 --> 00:39:51,633
They serve good Italian food 
of Irishmen to be.

275
00:39:52,968 --> 00:39:58,223
Tell me why you're such 
a depressing place.

276
00:39:59,725 --> 00:40:03,312
- I have a job. 
- A task?

277
00:40:04,062 --> 00:40:08,066
My mother was Jennifer Winston. 
She died here 14 years ago.

278
00:40:08,817 --> 00:40:12,988
- I want to know how. 
- It sounds pretty heavy.

279
00:40:13,739 --> 00:40:19,369
- Have you found anything yet, some clues? 
- No, not really.

280
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:24,583
- Have you met my mother? 
- No, I did not live here then.

281
00:40:25,334 --> 00:40:31,173
- Everyone has their perception of it. 
- I lived out west.

282
00:40:31,923 --> 00:40:35,177
Salute. On your task.

283
00:40:43,727 --> 00:40:48,940
If you need help 
with no matter what, so to.

284
00:40:50,275 --> 00:40:54,529
- I mean, I know people. 
- Do you know people?

285
00:40:56,198 --> 00:41:00,952
- What do you mean? What are you doing? 
- What would you have done?

286
00:41:04,373 --> 00:41:09,086
I joke, I am a lawyer. I make 
paperwork and take phones.

287
00:41:10,921 --> 00:41:17,552
I may need your help, 
if you can keep a secret.

288
00:41:18,303 --> 00:41:21,556
Just say, I will be happy.

289
00:41:22,307 --> 00:41:28,146
- Why would you help me? 
- Because I like you.

290
00:42:21,783 --> 00:42:25,537
Are you at home, Sammy?

291
00:42:26,663 --> 00:42:30,333
I come down.

292
00:42:37,632 --> 00:42:41,511
- How did it in the church tonight? 
- It was fine, really fine.

293
00:42:42,262 --> 00:42:45,473
I wish you came by one day.

294
00:42:46,224 --> 00:42:51,313
- Maybe you'd feel better. 
- I'm fine.

295
00:42:52,522 --> 00:42:56,651
I would just like to have you take with.

296
00:42:57,402 --> 00:43:04,075
So we can spend some quality time 
together.

297
00:43:04,993 --> 00:43:09,247
And talk after all these years.

298
00:43:14,044 --> 00:43:17,756
- I'm tired, I go to bed. 
- I'm too tired.

299
00:43:18,506 --> 00:43:21,134
Good night.

300
00:45:02,318 --> 00:45:04,571
I'm so sorry.

301
00:45:05,321 --> 00:45:08,116
Forgive me, Jen.

302
00:45:16,249 --> 00:45:20,503
- Forgive me! 
- What does he do?

303
00:45:21,421 --> 00:45:24,507
My Goodness!

304
00:45:53,494 --> 00:45:57,624
- Who are you? 
- I know you, you must travel from here.

305
00:45:58,374 --> 00:46:03,546
They kill you, fugitive!

306
00:46:11,346 --> 00:46:13,932
<I> My tax. </i>

307
00:46:29,781 --> 00:46:34,577
Thank you, Mr. Lopez. Goodbye.

308
00:46:35,328 --> 00:46:40,625
It's a shame. Mayor Lopez 
made the city what it is today.

309
00:46:42,043 --> 00:46:46,047
- How does Lucas all this sorrow? 
- He is incredible.

310
00:46:46,798 --> 00:46:50,176
I have worked here for over 20 years. 
He's a hero.

311
00:46:50,927 --> 00:46:53,596
He has always been a good boy.

312
00:46:54,347 --> 00:46:57,934
Did you know my mother?

313
00:47:00,520 --> 00:47:04,023
Yes, your mother was wonderful.

314
00:47:04,774 --> 00:47:09,445
- How did you know her? 
- She came here very often.

315
00:47:10,196 --> 00:47:13,533
And sometimes we ate lunch together 
and chatted.

316
00:47:14,283 --> 00:47:19,330
- You never mentioned. 
- I did not think it was necessary.

317
00:47:20,081 --> 00:47:24,293
- Did you not think it was necessary? 
- Your mother had major issues.

318
00:47:25,044 --> 00:47:28,923
The parents were dead, her sister lived 
far away, his brother could not help.

319
00:47:29,674 --> 00:47:33,136
Brother? 
My mother had no brother.

320
00:47:33,886 --> 00:47:38,725
- Yes, Thomas was her younger brother. 
- Thomas?

321
00:47:39,475 --> 00:47:44,939
- Where is he now? 
- In a nursing home somewhere.

322
00:47:45,690 --> 00:47:50,778
He did not come to your mother's funeral, 
my friend.

323
00:47:51,529 --> 00:47:55,742
He had mental problems. 
She visited him almost every day.

324
00:47:56,492 --> 00:48:02,165
- What do you know about the day she died? 
- It's a long time ago.

325
00:48:03,958 --> 00:48:06,753
I remember, she called it. 
She sounded upset.

326
00:48:07,503 --> 00:48:11,048
She did not feel well and wanted 
to Lucas passed.

327
00:48:11,799 --> 00:48:17,305
I said that I would say ...

328
00:48:19,891 --> 00:48:24,520
Sometimes it happens that bad things 
to good people.

329
00:48:25,271 --> 00:48:28,024
Ladies ... Am I interrupting?

330
00:48:28,774 --> 00:48:33,571
I was just getting ready 
for the meeting.

331
00:48:34,322 --> 00:48:38,826
- Is everything all right, Sam? 
- I have the papers on your desk ...

332
00:48:39,577 --> 00:48:44,540
That's fine, just go, Harriet, 
we talk later.

333
00:48:48,169 --> 00:48:54,717
She has not been herself in the 
last thing she is old and we have you.

334
00:48:55,468 --> 00:49:00,681
- She's afraid of losing his job. 
- I'm not Harriet's job.

335
00:49:01,432 --> 00:49:03,351
I do not even know if I will.

336
00:49:04,101 --> 00:49:06,729
Have you spoken with Mr. Lopez about the flowers?

337
00:49:08,814 --> 00:49:13,986
Why have you never mentioned that 
I have an uncle?

338
00:49:14,737 --> 00:49:19,283
I did not know if he was your mother's 
brother.

339
00:49:20,034 --> 00:49:24,080
Your mother used to take stragglers, 
she had a warm heart.

340
00:49:24,830 --> 00:49:27,917
- Forget it. 
- Forget it?

341
00:49:28,668 --> 00:49:33,881
Honestly so broke your mother is not 
to talk about him.

342
00:49:34,632 --> 00:49:37,927
She had you and your father to make sure.

343
00:49:38,678 --> 00:49:40,972
It was plenty.

344
00:49:41,722 --> 00:49:46,060
Yes, but I asked you to be honest.

345
00:49:49,480 --> 00:49:53,109
Yes ...

346
00:49:54,151 --> 00:50:00,408
- I heard that you ate with Liam Dawson. 
- Yes, he is nice.

347
00:50:01,158 --> 00:50:07,123
No, no, you must not have anything with them 
to do, it is not good for you.

348
00:50:07,873 --> 00:50:09,542
- Why? 
- None of them.

349
00:50:10,292 --> 00:50:12,712
- It was Liam, not his uncle. 
- Trust me.

350
00:50:13,462 --> 00:50:15,840
No, I do not need.

351
00:50:16,590 --> 00:50:20,594
You forgot to say that my mother had 
a brother.

352
00:50:21,345 --> 00:50:25,349
And now you want to decide who I should 
eat with?

353
00:50:30,479 --> 00:50:34,775
- My little girl ... 
- I made soup.

354
00:50:35,526 --> 00:50:38,821
- You're always tired. 
- Come on, baby, we go.

355
00:50:39,572 --> 00:50:45,911
- No, Jen! I ask you, sorry. 
- Stop now.

356
00:50:48,873 --> 00:50:52,042
Well, listen here.

357
00:50:54,086 --> 00:50:57,339
You're upset.

358
00:50:58,090 --> 00:51:02,136
Sorry, I did not mention Thomas.

359
00:51:02,887 --> 00:51:05,055
I did not believe ...

360
00:51:05,806 --> 00:51:09,018
I would not want you to ...

361
00:51:11,812 --> 00:51:16,984
Let's start over. 
I promise to be honest.

362
00:51:17,735 --> 00:51:20,780
Can you forgive me?

363
00:51:21,530 --> 00:51:25,075
If we start now?

364
00:51:27,995 --> 00:51:32,917
Where is Thomas? 
And he's really my uncle?

365
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:41,300
I do not know, let's go for a walk. 
Come on, it will do you good.

366
00:51:42,051 --> 00:51:44,428
- You freeze to. 
- No, I'm fine.

367
00:51:45,179 --> 00:51:50,142
I know you are an adult and such, 
but it makes no sense to freeze.

368
00:51:52,895 --> 00:51:56,732
First of all ... Thomas.

369
00:51:57,483 --> 00:52:02,196
I really think that he is dead.

370
00:52:03,822 --> 00:52:08,369
Approximately one week after your mother passed except

371
00:52:09,119 --> 00:52:11,539
- I heard that he took his own life.

372
00:52:12,289 --> 00:52:16,835
He could not see any sense 
to continue.

373
00:52:17,586 --> 00:52:22,216
He held in a way just up 
to exist.

374
00:52:22,967 --> 00:52:26,095
My Goodness.

375
00:52:32,476 --> 00:52:35,354
It's okay, I miss her too.

376
00:52:36,105 --> 00:52:40,526
Yes, we miss her all along.

377
00:52:41,735 --> 00:52:44,655
We all do together.

378
00:52:57,084 --> 00:53:00,796
Thank you for telling me about Thomas.

379
00:53:02,589 --> 00:53:08,637
But ... Liam is very nice to me.

380
00:53:09,388 --> 00:53:16,729
Liam is cute, and I'm sure 
that he is completely fine.

381
00:53:17,479 --> 00:53:22,568
He Uncle Benny is my 
partner.

382
00:53:23,318 --> 00:53:27,322
His services have always a price.

383
00:53:28,073 --> 00:53:31,910
And I will not see you in the end.

384
00:53:34,580 --> 00:53:37,041
Alright?

385
00:53:39,543 --> 00:53:42,671
- It's getting late. 
- Wait. you eat with us?

386
00:53:43,422 --> 00:53:45,799
I can not, 
I have something I need.

387
00:53:46,550 --> 00:53:52,848
- Do you need me tomorrow? 
- It's Saturday. No, mom you well.

388
00:53:53,599 --> 00:53:57,978
- I want to eat another day. 
​​ - You are always welcome.

389
00:53:58,729 --> 00:54:02,816
Feel better now? 
Smut home with you.

390
00:54:46,026 --> 00:54:48,904
Mother ...

391
00:54:50,155 --> 00:54:54,159
I thought I could figure it out 
here.

392
00:54:55,118 --> 00:54:58,872
I really did.

393
00:54:59,665 --> 00:55:03,293
I need answers.

394
00:55:12,636 --> 00:55:15,889
Here is nothing.

395
00:56:00,642 --> 00:56:03,020
I am coming.

396
00:56:18,785 --> 00:56:21,246
Hello?

397
00:56:22,914 --> 00:56:25,500
Hello?

398
00:56:42,726 --> 00:56:45,729
Hello?

399
00:56:51,443 --> 00:56:53,820
Liam?

400
00:56:54,571 --> 00:56:58,825
- How did you get in? 
- The door was open.

401
00:57:02,788 --> 00:57:07,417
Thanks, I did not wait for anyone.

402
00:57:09,461 --> 00:57:14,758
- Will you sit down? A cup of coffee? 
- Sure.

403
00:57:16,384 --> 00:57:20,347
- Milk and sugar? 
- Black, thanks.

404
00:57:26,394 --> 00:57:28,522
Here you go.

405
00:57:29,272 --> 00:57:33,985
I look like I do not know what, 
let me just fix me a little.

406
00:57:44,246 --> 00:57:47,332
Sam, I like you.

407
00:57:48,083 --> 00:57:50,752
Maybe too much.

408
00:57:51,503 --> 00:57:54,339
How can you like someone too much?

409
00:57:55,090 --> 00:58:01,513
I have big plans and have always believed 
that a relationship would come across.

410
00:58:02,681 --> 00:58:07,227
I also have big plans.

411
00:58:08,395 --> 00:58:13,358
What are they? 
We're together.

412
00:58:14,109 --> 00:58:18,071
Together? I know you bad enough.

413
00:58:18,822 --> 00:58:25,579
I only know that you and Benny Lucas' 
business partners.

414
00:58:27,080 --> 00:58:31,793
What are all the questions about?

415
00:58:34,004 --> 00:58:37,591
What are you doing for them?

416
00:58:39,092 --> 00:58:43,471
My father died when I was nine.

417
00:58:44,389 --> 00:58:47,267
He left almost nothing to me 
and my mother.

418
00:58:48,018 --> 00:58:52,397
My mother had to clean for people 
to get it to stick together.

419
00:58:53,148 --> 00:58:59,863
Uncle Benny was father's youngest brother, 
he paid the funeral.

420
00:59:00,614 --> 00:59:03,950
He kept calling 
and offer financial help.

421
00:59:04,701 --> 00:59:08,788
Mother was saying no. I worked 
hard to pay for college.

422
00:59:09,539 --> 00:59:13,585
When I got my exam, 
stood Uncle Benny there.

423
00:59:14,336 --> 00:59:20,050
He offered to pay 
for legal training, I said yes.

424
00:59:20,800 --> 00:59:25,305
He continued to send money 
to my mother, she lives in Manhattan now.

425
00:59:26,056 --> 00:59:28,808
I would not have anything 
if it was not for him.

426
00:59:29,559 --> 00:59:34,647
I am sure that you have done much 
more for your mom than Benny.

427
00:59:36,483 --> 00:59:40,528
- You are a good guy. 
- Maybe.

428
01:00:06,096 --> 01:00:09,349
Has your uncle ever said anything 
about my mother?

429
01:00:10,100 --> 01:00:13,269
What? No.

430
01:00:14,020 --> 01:00:18,608
- Are you sure? 
- Yes, I'm sure.

431
01:00:23,279 --> 01:00:28,827
Oh no, my father comes. 
Hurry.

432
01:00:31,246 --> 01:00:34,624
Go.

433
01:00:51,724 --> 01:00:53,560
Oh, hello.

434
01:00:54,310 --> 01:00:59,732
- Are you all right? 
- Yes, I was asleep.

435
01:01:02,402 --> 01:01:07,115
- Has anyone been here? 
- No.

436
01:01:09,909 --> 01:01:14,247
I'm tired, I go to bed.

437
01:01:59,375 --> 01:02:02,462
Are you feeling well?

438
01:02:03,212 --> 01:02:07,050
Yes, the door was jammed.

439
01:02:11,512 --> 01:02:17,101
I'm sorry I woke you. 
I have not slept in the past.

440
01:02:18,895 --> 01:02:21,731
Why have you not been able to sleep?

441
01:02:22,482 --> 01:02:26,027
I do not know this place, this town.

442
01:02:26,778 --> 01:02:30,114
I constantly think about Mom.

443
01:02:30,865 --> 01:02:36,496
I think about her all the time. 
She was a wonderful woman.

444
01:02:37,246 --> 01:02:40,375
This is something else, 
I can see her.

445
01:02:41,125 --> 01:02:46,130
I dream about her, 
but the dreams are nightmares.

446
01:02:46,881 --> 01:02:51,719
You should not have nightmares.

447
01:02:52,595 --> 01:02:55,848
It is I who should have nightmares.

448
01:02:56,599 --> 01:03:00,812
Not you, you should not have bad 
memories at all about your mother.

449
01:03:01,562 --> 01:03:05,483
I do not know if it's memories 
or fantasier-

450
01:03:06,234 --> 01:03:10,530
- But they all end up in the same 
manner.

451
01:03:11,280 --> 01:03:15,451
Mother is always ...

452
01:03:16,702 --> 01:03:19,956
You can tell me.

453
01:03:22,792 --> 01:03:26,796
Mom is always on you.

454
01:03:34,512 --> 01:03:39,225
I even have a nightmare about the day, 
she died.

455
01:03:39,976 --> 01:03:44,772
The doctor was there. 
He said she was dead.

456
01:03:45,773 --> 01:03:49,152
She was just dead.

457
01:03:58,077 --> 01:04:00,496
I could not save your mother.

458
01:04:01,247 --> 01:04:07,461
I lost you once, 
I will not lose you again.

459
01:04:08,379 --> 01:04:13,384
Before I became an alcoholic, I was a 
successful man.

460
01:04:14,135 --> 01:04:18,389
I bought wedding ring here 
to your mother. I ventet-

461
01:04:19,140 --> 01:04:25,479
- And hoped that you would find me, 
so I could give it to you.

462
01:04:34,322 --> 01:04:37,617
Honey, I was lost.

463
01:04:38,367 --> 01:04:40,953
Just like you.

464
01:04:41,704 --> 01:04:45,875
But I found the Lord.

465
01:04:47,376 --> 01:04:51,964
I wish it was that easy. 
That some beans could handle it.

466
01:04:52,715 --> 01:04:55,843
Is it really the best thing 
you can do?

467
01:04:56,594 --> 01:05:00,640
Everyone must find their own way.

468
01:05:01,599 --> 01:05:05,394
You will find your.

469
01:05:06,270 --> 01:05:10,941
Honey, I love you.

470
01:05:12,693 --> 01:05:14,654
Good night.

471
01:05:25,748 --> 01:05:29,293
Hello? Hello, Liam.

472
01:05:30,044 --> 01:05:35,508
No, I can not, 
I'm going to church with my father.

473
01:05:36,258 --> 01:05:42,598
I have to work tomorrow. 
I have to run, bye.

474
01:06:02,535 --> 01:06:07,373
- Can I help you? 
- I have to visit Thomas Burton.

475
01:06:08,124 --> 01:06:12,586
I am his niece.

476
01:06:16,674 --> 01:06:18,926
Hello, I'm dr. Rockwell.

477
01:06:19,677 --> 01:06:23,431
Your uncle is my patient. 
He's not well enough to get a visit.

478
01:06:24,181 --> 01:06:28,227
I just want to see him briefly.

479
01:06:32,523 --> 01:06:35,985
He's out on the terrace.

480
01:06:45,411 --> 01:06:49,874
How are you today, Thomas? 
You have a guest.

481
01:06:50,624 --> 01:06:55,462
Your niece, Samantha Winston, 
have come to visit you.

482
01:07:04,430 --> 01:07:07,266
Hello.

483
01:07:13,230 --> 01:07:15,774
Jen!

484
01:07:16,525 --> 01:07:21,614
Jen! Oh God ...

485
01:07:22,823 --> 01:07:24,658
Jen.

486
01:07:25,409 --> 01:07:29,038
I'm Samantha, Jennifer's daughter.

487
01:07:32,166 --> 01:07:35,836
Oh, sweetheart.

488
01:07:36,879 --> 01:07:39,924
Little girl.

489
01:07:42,676 --> 01:07:46,388
I must know what happened to the mother.

490
01:07:49,016 --> 01:07:53,604
Do you know how she died?

491
01:07:57,608 --> 01:08:00,152
They killed her.

492
01:08:00,903 --> 01:08:03,238
Who?

493
01:08:04,323 --> 01:08:06,825
The dræbte-

494
01:08:07,576 --> 01:08:09,662
- My sweet-

495
01:08:10,412 --> 01:08:12,206
- Sister.

496
01:08:12,957 --> 01:08:15,751
And you know what?

497
01:08:18,796 --> 01:08:22,925
They kill you. 
They do.

498
01:08:25,052 --> 01:08:28,138
They kill you.

499
01:08:29,390 --> 01:08:32,685
They will cut you off.

500
01:08:33,435 --> 01:08:36,271
- Who wants to kill me? 
- Calm down, Thomas.

501
01:08:37,022 --> 01:08:41,735
He does not feel well. 
You can visit him a second time.

502
01:08:42,486 --> 01:08:45,239
- I come back, I promise. 
- No! Listen to me!

503
01:08:45,989 --> 01:08:49,535
Listen to me, I beg you.

504
01:08:50,285 --> 01:08:56,041
- Thomas. 
- Do not trust anyone.

505
01:08:57,334 --> 01:09:01,171
Listen to me, especially not Lucas.

506
01:09:01,922 --> 01:09:05,050
Do you understand me?

507
01:09:05,801 --> 01:09:08,512
- Ms. Winston ... 
- I'm coming back.

508
01:09:09,263 --> 01:09:13,308
I come again, I promise.

509
01:09:14,852 --> 01:09:18,689
No, come on, sit down.

510
01:09:36,748 --> 01:09:42,337
I hate to sound like a father, 
but are you sure you're okay?

511
01:09:43,964 --> 01:09:49,887
- I do not know. 
- What actually happens?

512
01:09:50,637 --> 01:09:54,975
I told Jack about my dreams, 
and I was worried about them.

513
01:09:55,726 --> 01:09:59,730
- And? 
- Ha told me to go to church.

514
01:10:00,481 --> 01:10:06,570
I do not think helps dreams 
is getting worse, I can not even sleep.

515
01:10:07,321 --> 01:10:10,657
It is time that you talk 
with a doctor.

516
01:10:11,408 --> 01:10:17,080
Maybe, but how to be a doctor could 
help me?

517
01:10:17,831 --> 01:10:22,836
- I do not think anything helps. 
- I know exactly who to talk to.

518
01:10:23,587 --> 01:10:28,300
- I have a deal for you on Monday. 
​​ - What kind of doctor?

519
01:10:29,051 --> 01:10:31,595
A psychiatrist.

520
01:10:32,346 --> 01:10:36,642
What? 
You think I'm crazy?

521
01:10:37,392 --> 01:10:40,354
- Wait! 
- No, let me be. Liam believe me.

522
01:10:41,104 --> 01:10:46,151
Liam can not help you. 
Come here.

523
01:10:46,902 --> 01:10:51,323
Sit on the couch, listen to me.

524
01:10:52,074 --> 01:10:58,330
You are safe here, I'm on your side. 
We'll find out here.

525
01:10:59,081 --> 01:11:03,168
You can relax, 
remember that you are comfortable here.

526
01:11:03,919 --> 01:11:06,630
I'm on your side.

527
01:11:07,381 --> 01:11:10,842
I am your friend.

528
01:11:12,970 --> 01:11:15,222
I'll be here shortly.

529
01:11:16,598 --> 01:11:20,560
Breathe deep, it'll go all 
together.

530
01:11:23,480 --> 01:11:26,233
I'm right here.

531
01:11:32,114 --> 01:11:33,991
Well.

532
01:11:34,741 --> 01:11:39,079
Lovely cold.

533
01:11:42,332 --> 01:11:45,335
Nothing is happening.

534
01:11:48,213 --> 01:11:51,633
Well.

535
01:11:53,719 --> 01:11:58,557
Sync and relax. 
You are quite excited.

536
01:12:01,685 --> 01:12:06,273
You can relax a little. 
Lie here a moment.

537
01:12:07,023 --> 01:12:09,526
How, my friend.

538
01:12:10,277 --> 01:12:14,197
Here, kick off your shoes.

539
01:12:16,825 --> 01:12:20,454
How.

540
01:12:24,583 --> 01:12:27,961
Well.

541
01:12:31,089 --> 01:12:36,428
Relax completely, 
you must not think of anything.

542
01:12:38,430 --> 01:12:43,518
You look beautiful. 
You look like your mother on a bullet.

543
01:12:45,770 --> 01:12:48,940
You look like her completely.

544
01:12:56,072 --> 01:13:00,452
Relax.

545
01:13:18,345 --> 01:13:21,973
I love you so much, Jen.

546
01:13:22,724 --> 01:13:25,644
I love you so much.

547
01:13:27,479 --> 01:13:31,691
Jen, I have always loved you.

548
01:13:32,734 --> 01:13:35,987
I am not my mother.

549
01:13:37,155 --> 01:13:43,286
Sorry, I'm sorry, 
I know.

550
01:13:44,204 --> 01:13:49,209
Rest now just, 
I have to go for a moment.

551
01:13:49,960 --> 01:13:55,215
I go, you just stay here 
and relax, you are in security here.

552
01:13:55,966 --> 01:13:59,219
I'll be back.

553
01:16:34,123 --> 01:16:38,294
- Hello. 
- What do you do?

554
01:16:40,713 --> 01:16:45,218
- You know why I'm here. 
- No, I do not.

555
01:16:47,470 --> 01:16:52,225
- Why she works for you? 
- She needed a job.

556
01:16:52,976 --> 01:16:58,189
Do you think it is wise to have her 
here?

557
01:16:58,940 --> 01:17:00,817
It is impressive Lucas.

558
01:17:01,567 --> 01:17:05,446
You get all the jewels. 
Last year it was a movie star.

559
01:17:06,197 --> 01:17:10,660
This year it is our dear mayor 
Maria Lopez.

560
01:17:11,411 --> 01:17:14,872
You are a kind of king of the dead.

561
01:17:15,623 --> 01:17:17,834
You ...

562
01:17:18,584 --> 01:17:23,214
You make her beautiful for the big day?

563
01:17:29,220 --> 01:17:31,931
You should never have lost the election.

564
01:17:32,682 --> 01:17:38,855
It was a golden opportunity. I bet 
great on your seat in the Senate.

565
01:17:41,315 --> 01:17:45,403
You cost me a lot of money.

566
01:17:47,947 --> 01:17:53,786
I know you do not hear so well.

567
01:17:57,248 --> 01:18:00,501
So I ask again.

568
01:18:01,252 --> 01:18:07,175
- Why she works for you? 
- I'll keep an eye on her.

569
01:18:09,844 --> 01:18:12,638
You learn it apparently never.

570
01:18:13,389 --> 01:18:18,436
What is it with you and the family? 
You knew this was risky.

571
01:18:19,312 --> 01:18:23,316
If she wants answers, 
I should maybe even give her them.

572
01:18:24,067 --> 01:18:27,070
No, you stay away from her.

573
01:18:27,820 --> 01:18:31,657
You've always got it with me 
and Jennifer.

574
01:18:33,242 --> 01:18:37,079
Never forget who made you 
to the king.

575
01:18:37,830 --> 01:18:44,712
Why do you live in a palace, and why 
your innocent children go to private school.

576
01:18:45,463 --> 01:18:48,674
- I never asked. 
- Yes, you have.

577
01:18:49,425 --> 01:18:52,470
Had you done that you should, 
everything had been in order.

578
01:18:53,221 --> 01:18:58,893
But you should definitely fall in love 
in your little whore.

579
01:19:01,312 --> 01:19:05,358
She was no whore. 
It reiterates you never more.

580
01:19:06,651 --> 01:19:11,781
You are emotional, how often should I 
say that it is not personal.

581
01:19:12,532 --> 01:19:15,701
It's just business.

582
01:19:54,699 --> 01:19:58,619
- What can I do for you? 
- Drill dr. Kaplan here?

583
01:19:59,370 --> 01:20:01,956
- Yes, he does. 
- I'm Samantha Winston.

584
01:20:02,707 --> 01:20:07,003
- Can I talk to him for a moment? 
- He has suffered a stroke.

585
01:20:07,753 --> 01:20:10,715
- I ask ... 
- He can not see anyone.

586
01:20:39,493 --> 01:20:43,247
What's wrong with you?

587
01:20:49,628 --> 01:20:55,885
- What's wrong? 
- I'm bored, I came after some beers.

588
01:21:03,184 --> 01:21:08,981
- How was your date? 
- It was not much of a date.

589
01:21:09,732 --> 01:21:14,862
We went here, ate, drank some wine.

590
01:21:17,698 --> 01:21:22,203
- So it was weird. 
- What do you mean?

591
01:21:22,953 --> 01:21:27,374
We had to learn each other 
to know.

592
01:21:28,125 --> 01:21:32,505
But before I knew a word of it ...

593
01:21:33,255 --> 01:21:36,258
- Everything was fine. 
​​- It does not sound weird.

594
01:21:37,009 --> 01:21:41,263
She asked if you have ever 
mentioned her mother.

595
01:21:42,014 --> 01:21:45,851
- She said what? 
- Yes, I know.

596
01:21:46,602 --> 01:21:51,107
And then she pushed me out 
through the back door.

597
01:21:51,857 --> 01:21:55,027
I called in the morning and ...

598
01:21:55,778 --> 01:21:59,949
- She pretended she did not know me. 
- Did you bring her mother up?

599
01:22:00,699 --> 01:22:05,913
No, that was what made it 
so weird.

600
01:22:09,834 --> 01:22:15,172
- Do me a favor. 
- All for you, Uncle Benny.

601
01:22:15,923 --> 01:22:22,263
There's something you should know. Things that 
never get outside these walls.

602
01:22:23,138 --> 01:22:27,142
I never repeat anything you say.

603
01:22:28,936 --> 01:22:32,982
The girl you see, the trouble.

604
01:22:33,899 --> 01:22:39,238
- Samantha? 
- I say this only once.

605
01:22:41,574 --> 01:22:46,287
I can not express it differently. 
She can destroy the entire city.

606
01:22:47,580 --> 01:22:50,833
How could she do it?

607
01:22:51,750 --> 01:22:54,628
Can you remember when you came to visit 
after high school?

608
01:22:55,379 --> 01:23:00,009
It is 13 to 14 years ago.

609
01:23:00,759 --> 01:23:05,180
This started back then, 
and now it's starting all over again.

610
01:23:05,973 --> 01:23:10,436
- I do not understand. 
- They cast a spell over the city.

611
01:23:11,812 --> 01:23:16,567
Years ago asked Lucas up 
to the Senate for my money.

612
01:23:17,318 --> 01:23:21,447
He had a promising political career, 
but then came the whore ...

613
01:23:22,197 --> 01:23:27,161
But I fixed it, 
because that's what I do.

614
01:23:27,911 --> 01:23:33,459
- Fixed it? 
- Yes, what is it you do not understand?

615
01:23:34,209 --> 01:23:40,341
She poses a threat to all, 
your nice home, your house home, everything.

616
01:23:41,675 --> 01:23:45,012
- I do not understand. 
- You do not understand it.

617
01:23:45,763 --> 01:23:53,604
You just listen. And you need to find out 
of everything, I mean everything, she has discovered.

618
01:23:55,356 --> 01:23:59,610
Get it planted in your head, 
and drink so out while you're at it.

619
01:24:03,322 --> 01:24:05,282
<I> My friend. </i>

620
01:24:06,700 --> 01:24:08,827
<I> My friend. </i>

621
01:24:11,872 --> 01:24:16,043
<I> - My little treasure. </i> 
<i> - What? </i>

622
01:24:17,294 --> 01:24:22,716
<I> My little treasure, your little darling. </i>

623
01:24:23,467 --> 01:24:26,303
<I> What? </i>

624
01:26:40,812 --> 01:26:45,067
- Good morning. 
- Good morning.

625
01:26:50,781 --> 01:26:56,203
Want some eggs? 
I have to run some errands.

626
01:26:56,953 --> 01:27:00,290
And later in the day there are funerals.

627
01:27:01,041 --> 01:27:05,962
All come well for prayers 
for mayor Lopez.

628
01:27:06,713 --> 01:27:10,967
I'll just have coffee. 
The cookies look good.

629
01:27:13,428 --> 01:27:18,225
You always have to be happy 
for cookies with chocolate pieces.

630
01:27:25,357 --> 01:27:29,861
And you have always been happy 
for clamchowder.

631
01:28:13,989 --> 01:28:20,787
I have to go, 
but I will come back later.

632
01:28:55,030 --> 01:29:01,119
<I> Jack, the least I could do was, </i> 
<i> to take care of the funeral. Lucas. </i>

633
01:29:12,255 --> 01:29:15,508
Mother?

634
01:29:18,678 --> 01:29:22,849
- Not too close to the altar. 
- Yes, there are two devotions to Mary Lopez.

635
01:29:27,479 --> 01:29:29,939
Yes, we expect a large turnout.

636
01:29:30,690 --> 01:29:34,152
You look good. Come on.

637
01:29:35,945 --> 01:29:39,366
Too late. You should be happy, 
you have a job here!

638
01:29:40,116 --> 01:29:42,744
- Pick up the phone! 
- You've been at it since Jennifer.

639
01:29:43,495 --> 01:29:46,915
I saved you Jennifer, 
I do not do it again with Samantha.

640
01:29:47,666 --> 01:29:52,837
You do not take care of Samantha 
and Thomas, your play is over soon.

641
01:29:57,926 --> 01:30:02,097
Benny aligned second

642
01:30:03,223 --> 01:30:07,811
Listen, I can not do this now.

643
01:30:08,561 --> 01:30:12,691
No, you stay away from her. 
I'll fix it here.

644
01:30:24,452 --> 01:30:27,831
David, I need to visit Thomas Burton.

645
01:30:28,581 --> 01:30:33,753
- Here is no Thomas. 
- I was here after all yesterday.

646
01:30:34,504 --> 01:30:38,258
- A doctor showed me over to him. 
- I've never seen you before.

647
01:30:39,008 --> 01:30:41,594
We have only 20 residents, I would know 
what if one of them called Thomas.

648
01:30:42,345 --> 01:30:47,183
I spoke to you yesterday.

649
01:30:50,770 --> 01:30:55,692
Doctor, I was here yesterday.

650
01:30:56,443 --> 01:30:59,946
I need to talk to my uncle 
Thomas.

651
01:31:00,697 --> 01:31:06,161
- We have no Thomas. 
- He was here yesterday, I spoke with him.

652
01:31:06,911 --> 01:31:10,373
- There are no Thomas. 
- I saw him yesterday.

653
01:31:11,124 --> 01:31:13,585
Are you feeling well?

654
01:31:14,335 --> 01:31:19,132
- Please follow. 
- What is this?

655
01:31:19,883 --> 01:31:26,639
I saw him, he was here yesterday.

656
01:31:31,853 --> 01:31:37,275
- The queue goes around the entire area. 
- It was expected.

657
01:31:47,327 --> 01:31:52,040
How beautiful that there are so many. 
This is her cousins.

658
01:31:52,790 --> 01:31:56,961
- May I offer my condolences. 
- Thank you.

659
01:32:00,965 --> 01:32:04,385
- Lucas had to go. 
- Is something wrong?

660
01:32:05,136 --> 01:32:09,432
He takes care of a personal matter, 
we must ensure this.

661
01:33:04,654 --> 01:33:08,866
Mr Benny, everything seems to be 
in order.

662
01:33:09,617 --> 01:33:14,288
You look nice, new suit, 
and you lost you.

663
01:33:18,835 --> 01:33:24,841
- No, I must talk to you alone. 
​​- Liam is good enough.

664
01:33:25,591 --> 01:33:30,054
I just explained that I had to 
do things for you 14 years ago.

665
01:33:30,805 --> 01:33:34,684
That I do not want to discuss now, 
our girl needs help.

666
01:33:35,435 --> 01:33:42,608
Precisely, I said no, 
it would not work?

667
01:33:43,401 --> 01:33:47,113
How subordinates you?

668
01:33:47,864 --> 01:33:51,868
Should I tell him?

669
01:33:52,702 --> 01:33:58,166
I had no choice, because she was 
pregnant, and Lucas career was in danger.

670
01:34:00,084 --> 01:34:03,504
- Did you kill her? 
- Take and become adult.

671
01:34:04,255 --> 01:34:10,595
Are you 11? Dr. Kaplan performed 
a cesarean a little too early.

672
01:34:11,554 --> 01:34:15,516
The cub is alive. He is yours.

673
01:34:21,606 --> 01:34:24,358
- How old are you? 
-14.

674
01:34:26,444 --> 01:34:32,992
Jennifer did not do well, and your 
dear Harriet rang, so I helped.

675
01:34:33,743 --> 01:34:39,999
Shut up! Shut up! 
I will not hear it here now!

676
01:34:40,750 --> 01:34:45,004
Harriet, is Lucas who?

677
01:34:46,088 --> 01:34:50,092
Well, ask him to come.

678
01:35:02,271 --> 01:35:03,940
Benny.

679
01:35:04,690 --> 01:35:09,111
Kaplan called it 'Placenta Abruptio'.

680
01:35:09,862 --> 01:35:16,410
A fascinating process, they stand 
placenta from the uterine wall.

681
01:35:19,455 --> 01:35:25,378
The important thing is that everyone, including Jack, 
thought that pregnancy killed her.

682
01:35:26,128 --> 01:35:29,131
You have supplanted it here for 14 years, right?

683
01:35:29,882 --> 01:35:34,887
But ... It tastes good!

684
01:35:35,638 --> 01:35:41,686
It was a nice cremation until the 
bitch, Patricia asked questions.

685
01:35:42,436 --> 01:35:45,606
What are you talking about? 
I did not help with anything, it was you!

686
01:35:46,357 --> 01:35:50,111
I had stopped you if I could.

687
01:35:50,861 --> 01:35:55,700
You may not dare to kill anyone, 
but nothing to curb your career.

688
01:35:56,450 --> 01:36:03,332
Well, listen to me. Make you the girl 
something beating I'll kill you.

689
01:36:06,002 --> 01:36:09,005
I do.

690
01:36:11,549 --> 01:36:16,846
You can not hurt a fly. 
There's something you must understand.

691
01:36:19,140 --> 01:36:22,059
I did it for your sake 
and the family.

692
01:36:22,810 --> 01:36:25,187
I took care of Kaplan 
and your mother.

693
01:36:25,938 --> 01:36:28,315
They were a danger to the city.

694
01:36:31,068 --> 01:36:33,571
It is not personally.

695
01:36:34,321 --> 01:36:39,285
It's always, always about business.

696
01:36:40,745 --> 01:36:44,749
- Jack! 
- Stay there! I'll fix it.

697
01:36:52,465 --> 01:36:55,885
Sam!

698
01:37:24,288 --> 01:37:27,041
Jack!

699
01:37:27,791 --> 01:37:31,420
Sheep! Sheep!

700
01:37:33,172 --> 01:37:33,672
Sheep!

701
01:37:34,423 --> 01:37:38,219
I told you she gave trouble.

702
01:37:38,969 --> 01:37:40,137
Dad, where are you?

703
01:37:40,888 --> 01:37:46,018
I can not believe Lucas.

704
01:37:47,394 --> 01:37:51,565
I can not take care of the cops now, 
I have to find the girl.

705
01:37:56,695 --> 01:38:00,199
Think of all the possibilities 
I have given him.

706
01:38:00,950 --> 01:38:04,536
He screw up themselves every time.

707
01:38:36,318 --> 01:38:39,530
This is not good.

708
01:38:40,281 --> 01:38:44,243
She heard the whole conversation.

709
01:38:59,091 --> 01:39:01,510
Is it her?

710
01:39:52,269 --> 01:39:55,230
Why do not you phone?

711
01:39:57,357 --> 01:40:01,737
Why can not I get hold of you, 
Jack?

712
01:40:05,073 --> 01:40:08,035
Dig a hole.

713
01:40:08,786 --> 01:40:14,124
After everything I've done for you 
and your family ...

714
01:40:14,875 --> 01:40:19,046
You are a pathetic man. 
Move, Liam.

715
01:40:19,797 --> 01:40:23,926
- Please. 
- Liam, move.

716
01:40:24,676 --> 01:40:29,139
You killed my mother!

717
01:40:42,903 --> 01:40:44,738
Liam ...

718
01:40:45,489 --> 01:40:48,325
Liam!

719
01:40:49,201 --> 01:40:51,119
Liam!

720
01:40:52,913 --> 01:40:55,082
Liam!

721
01:40:57,376 --> 01:40:58,168
Oh, Liam.

722
01:40:58,919 --> 01:41:01,838
Do not, I beg you.

723
01:41:02,589 --> 01:41:04,758
Sheep?

724
01:41:05,509 --> 01:41:10,013
- I love you, Sam. 
- Dad.

725
01:41:10,764 --> 01:41:15,894
I love you so much.

726
01:41:17,312 --> 01:41:20,774
It'll go all together.

727
01:41:21,525 --> 01:41:27,447
- Where are you going? 
- It'll go all together.

728
01:41:28,907 --> 01:41:30,826
I beg you ...

729
01:41:31,576 --> 01:41:35,247
- Where are you going? 
- I love you.

730
01:41:35,998 --> 01:41:36,832
- Sam! 
- Dad.

731
01:41:37,582 --> 01:41:39,293
The orders themselves.

732
01:41:40,043 --> 01:41:44,172
- Dad! 
- Sam, listen to me.

733
01:41:44,923 --> 01:41:48,135
He's not there. 
Jack has passed away.

734
01:41:48,885 --> 01:41:52,139
Jack is dead. 
He died long ago.

735
01:41:52,889 --> 01:41:57,060
He died long ago.

736
01:41:57,811 --> 01:42:04,192
- He's not here. 
- No, he's alive.

737
01:42:04,943 --> 01:42:11,074
No, he died long ago.

738
01:42:11,825 --> 01:42:17,247
- It was you who killed your father. 
- Shut up! It was an accident.

739
01:42:17,998 --> 01:42:22,711
It was an accident, do not listen to him.

740
01:42:23,462 --> 01:42:26,923
You can not even take care of your wife 
and child!

741
01:42:27,674 --> 01:42:32,262
I would never make my family 
something! Get out of my house!

742
01:42:33,013 --> 01:42:36,975
Enough is enough, go away!

743
01:42:37,726 --> 01:42:39,936
No, Daddy!

744
01:42:43,857 --> 01:42:46,818
Sheep?

745
01:42:47,569 --> 01:42:52,324
Samantha, you have been in hospital 
for a long time.

746
01:42:53,075 --> 01:42:55,160
I would see if you could clear up 
themselves.

747
01:42:55,911 --> 01:43:00,791
Sheep? Sheep?

748
01:43:01,541 --> 01:43:05,212
It can, I promise you. 
It'll go all together.

749
01:43:05,962 --> 01:43:09,633
I will help you.

750
01:43:32,447 --> 01:43:36,034
It's been more than seven hours, 
and she has not said a word.

751
01:43:38,912 --> 01:43:42,999
We must drive her back, 
so that treatment can be resumed.

752
01:43:43,750 --> 01:43:47,921
Do you understand me?

753
01:43:52,342 --> 01:43:56,263
Yes. Yes I understand.

754
01:44:57,032 --> 01:45:04,456
In memory of
