1
00:00:47,247 --> 00:00:48,305
Hello?

2
00:00:48,381 --> 00:00:50,440
Beth, hey.

3
00:00:50,517 --> 00:00:51,745
Can you let me up?

4
00:00:51,818 --> 00:00:52,842
I, uh...

5
00:00:52,919 --> 00:00:54,887
I'm locked out of my apartment

6
00:00:54,954 --> 00:00:58,549
and I lost my wallet and my keys.

7
00:00:58,658 --> 00:01:00,922
No. You can't come up right now.

8
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:05,257
Is someone up there with you?

9
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:08,890
No.

10
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:13,334
Is it him?

11
00:01:16,176 --> 00:01:19,304
Look, Beth, I...

12
00:01:19,379 --> 00:01:21,244
I'm locked out.

13
00:01:21,314 --> 00:01:24,044
And I have had the worst night
of my life and I...

14
00:01:26,252 --> 00:01:28,447
Look, if you help me,
I'll leave you alone.

15
00:01:28,521 --> 00:01:30,489
Okay? Both of you.

16
00:01:44,204 --> 00:01:46,502
I feel sorry for you, Tommy.

17
00:01:46,573 --> 00:01:47,801
I do.

18
00:02:46,533 --> 00:02:47,830
Have you ever been lied to

19
00:02:47,901 --> 00:02:50,631
by someone you trusted completely?

20
00:02:50,703 --> 00:02:53,604
Just had your little heart torn out

21
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:56,699
and shoved down your throat?

22
00:02:56,776 --> 00:03:00,212
Trust me, it's not nearly
as fun as it sounds.

23
00:03:08,755 --> 00:03:09,949
I hate to admit it,

24
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:13,618
but I was totally blindsided
by the whole thing.

25
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:16,526
And I deal with the best liars
in the world every day.

26
00:03:16,596 --> 00:03:19,030
I'm shorted another hundred thousand.

27
00:03:19,098 --> 00:03:20,190
That's right, every sale's a good one.

28
00:03:20,266 --> 00:03:21,790
Take that spin off the fucking tape

29
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:24,359
or I'm gonna come through this phone
and bite your fucking eyes out.

30
00:03:24,437 --> 00:03:25,597
Okay, talk to you later.

31
00:03:25,672 --> 00:03:27,833
...is up 30 percent,
top line is flat.

32
00:03:27,907 --> 00:03:29,602
It's not my fault you own this dodgy stock.

33
00:03:29,676 --> 00:03:31,541
Don't worry, don't worry,
you're in good hands.

34
00:03:31,611 --> 00:03:34,273
Half a million Johnny-John
to travel, who's in?

35
00:03:34,347 --> 00:03:36,542
This girl is a-fucking-mazing.

36
00:03:36,616 --> 00:03:38,777
Is anybody gonna get me fucking done
on the Cisco, please?

37
00:03:38,851 --> 00:03:39,977
Make some calls, people, please.

38
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:41,987
Yeah, just hold for me.

39
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:44,250
How, you're done at 50 thou on the figure,
Jen'll call you with the report.

40
00:03:44,324 --> 00:03:45,882
- All right? Did you get that 50,000?
- Calling him now.

41
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:47,824
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.

42
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:50,192
My whole system just crashed again.

43
00:03:50,263 --> 00:03:51,457
Where is Iceman?

44
00:03:51,531 --> 00:03:52,964
You sent him out for coffee.

45
00:03:53,032 --> 00:03:54,556
Hey, Shakes,
am I filling that Microsoft yet, or...

46
00:03:54,634 --> 00:03:55,896
I'm working it, man.

47
00:03:55,969 --> 00:03:58,199
- Where the fuck is my latte?
- Probably still with Iceman.

48
00:03:58,304 --> 00:04:00,169
Shakespeare, it's fucking Microsoft.
Just put it up.

49
00:04:00,206 --> 00:04:02,174
- Okay.
- Bobby, stay with me, all right?

50
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:04,039
- He's working it. I'll have it done soon.
- What is the point

51
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:07,204
of having an Army geek computer nerd

52
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:10,113
if he is never fucking here?

53
00:04:10,183 --> 00:04:13,448
A Princeton diploma and three years
in the Air Force put to good use.

54
00:04:14,721 --> 00:04:16,450
Thank you, Daniel.

55
00:04:16,522 --> 00:04:18,285
And 63 cents change.

56
00:04:24,564 --> 00:04:26,828
Listen, Daniel, my computer
has crashed again.

57
00:04:26,899 --> 00:04:29,925
Would you mind taking a look
when you get the chance?

58
00:04:30,003 --> 00:04:34,133
Well, did you check and see if you just
kicked out the plug again?

59
00:04:39,312 --> 00:04:42,440
It was kind of acting up
before that, though.

60
00:04:42,515 --> 00:04:44,847
Thanks, soldier.

61
00:05:00,566 --> 00:05:03,364
You know, when I first started,

62
00:05:03,436 --> 00:05:05,267
he used to send me
to McDonald's every day.

63
00:05:05,338 --> 00:05:08,705
Double quarter pounder with cheese,
hold the pickles.

64
00:05:08,775 --> 00:05:11,539
Doesn't really bother me that much.

65
00:05:11,611 --> 00:05:12,942
You won't be here in a year

66
00:05:13,012 --> 00:05:15,344
if you keep on serving coffee to that prick.

67
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:18,716
Well, I like working with computers,

68
00:05:18,785 --> 00:05:22,516
but to be honest,
the stuff that I'm doing here...

69
00:05:22,588 --> 00:05:25,182
I'd rather do what you do at some point.

70
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:30,759
"This is the saddest
story I have ever heard."

71
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:33,856
<i>Thus begins the classic novel
The Good Soldier,</i>

72
00:05:33,933 --> 00:05:39,803
in one of the most memorable
first lines in modern fiction.

73
00:05:39,872 --> 00:05:43,069
Well, that sounds
about as fun as date rape.

74
00:05:43,142 --> 00:05:44,905
<i>No kidding, I vote for Lolita.</i>

75
00:05:44,977 --> 00:05:47,172
Then it's sex with minors by a landslide.

76
00:05:47,246 --> 00:05:49,305
<i>Can we read
The Good Soldier next, though?</i>

77
00:05:49,382 --> 00:05:50,940
Can't we ever read something
with a happy ending?

78
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:53,383
This is New York City.
The only happy endings are in Chinatown.

79
00:05:53,453 --> 00:05:56,013
- No offense.
- None taken. I'm Korean.

80
00:05:56,089 --> 00:05:57,215
Are you really?

81
00:05:57,290 --> 00:06:00,623
No. What's wrong with you people?

82
00:06:04,097 --> 00:06:05,587
Have a good night, Tommy.

83
00:06:05,665 --> 00:06:06,757
You too, Irv.

84
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:08,892
- Taxi?
- Donny. Yes, please.

85
00:06:08,968 --> 00:06:10,458
For all the excitement and glamour,

86
00:06:10,536 --> 00:06:14,438
life in the big city
does have its downside.

87
00:06:14,507 --> 00:06:18,568
I mean, if you thought
Wall Street was full of bullshitters,

88
00:06:18,644 --> 00:06:22,205
you should try having
a relationship here.

89
00:06:22,281 --> 00:06:25,409
And maybe it's like this
everywhere nowadays,

90
00:06:25,485 --> 00:06:28,852
but it just feels like
a war zone here sometimes.

91
00:06:30,656 --> 00:06:33,489
I know everyone has
some kind of a history.

92
00:06:33,559 --> 00:06:37,393
It's not like I've always been a saint.

93
00:06:37,463 --> 00:06:40,626
You know, I guess I just hoped things
would be different with Beth.

94
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:42,930
You've been dating for two months
and you still haven't had sex?

95
00:06:43,002 --> 00:06:44,629
You made Rich wait about two hours.

96
00:06:44,704 --> 00:06:46,899
Maybe your first time
with him could be in Italy.

97
00:06:46,973 --> 00:06:48,804
- You never know.
- Aw.

98
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:50,433
- That would be lovely.
- Cheesy.

99
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:52,569
What would you do if Rich left his wife?

100
00:06:54,147 --> 00:06:55,273
Where did that come from?

101
00:06:55,348 --> 00:06:57,646
Hi. I hope I'm not interrupting.

102
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:59,047
Oh, hey.

103
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:01,815
No, we were just
talking about shopping.

104
00:07:01,888 --> 00:07:03,981
- Oh, I'm sure you were.
- Yeah.

105
00:07:04,056 --> 00:07:05,045
You know Jordan.

106
00:07:05,124 --> 00:07:07,149
This is Lisa, Susan, and Jill.

107
00:07:07,226 --> 00:07:08,488
- Hi.
- Hi.

108
00:07:08,561 --> 00:07:09,994
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

109
00:07:10,062 --> 00:07:11,723
Would you guys like
to go grab a drink with us?

110
00:07:11,798 --> 00:07:13,629
- My treat?
- Oh, thanks, but we're

111
00:07:13,699 --> 00:07:15,257
meeting my boyfriend Bill
and some of his friends.

112
00:07:15,334 --> 00:07:16,733
From Facebook.

113
00:07:16,803 --> 00:07:18,293
- Bye.
- He's adorable.

114
00:07:18,371 --> 00:07:19,895
- Oh.
- He's hot. If you don't do him, I will.

115
00:07:19,972 --> 00:07:22,270
- Okay.
- Bye, Tommy. Nice to meet you.

116
00:07:22,341 --> 00:07:25,071
- Have fun.
- What was she whispering to you?

117
00:07:25,144 --> 00:07:27,135
Maybe I'll tell you in Italy.

118
00:07:29,982 --> 00:07:33,850
Do you think it means something
that we're both left-handed?

119
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:38,323
We'd only need one pair of scissors
if we moved in together.

120
00:07:38,391 --> 00:07:43,488
Isn't it a little early to be talking
about sharing scissors?

121
00:07:49,268 --> 00:07:55,036
Does it bother you that
I'm not doing anything...

122
00:07:55,107 --> 00:07:57,905
amazing with my life?

123
00:07:58,010 --> 00:07:59,739
There's plenty of time for that.

124
00:07:59,779 --> 00:08:02,714
Yeah. I don't want to end up
like my boss Cash, you know?

125
00:08:02,782 --> 00:08:06,582
Like, almost 50,
nothing to show for it but a bad marriage

126
00:08:06,652 --> 00:08:09,883
and an awesome set of golf clubs.

127
00:08:09,956 --> 00:08:14,757
Yeah. My boss is 42 and she's never
been married or anything.

128
00:08:14,827 --> 00:08:17,193
I don't think she's ever even been in love.

129
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:21,159
Have you?

130
00:08:24,103 --> 00:08:25,536
I thought so.

131
00:08:25,605 --> 00:08:29,541
But I think that when somebody turns out
to be completely different

132
00:08:29,609 --> 00:08:32,237
than what you thought,
it doesn't really count.

133
00:08:35,648 --> 00:08:38,378
What happened with
your last girlfriend?

134
00:08:38,451 --> 00:08:39,611
Christie.

135
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:44,019
It just wasn't right.

136
00:08:53,099 --> 00:08:54,623
You want to get that?

137
00:09:01,774 --> 00:09:04,607
Yeah, no.

138
00:09:04,677 --> 00:09:06,804
Thought he stopped calling.

139
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:10,280
He did. He started again.

140
00:09:12,885 --> 00:09:14,409
We all have a past, Beth.

141
00:09:14,487 --> 00:09:17,285
It's... It's how you deal with it.

142
00:09:23,996 --> 00:09:26,464
I just got off the phone with the people
on the Battery Park dig.

143
00:09:26,532 --> 00:09:28,090
They uncovered an old wall

144
00:09:28,167 --> 00:09:30,795
that I think could be from
the original Dutch settlement here.

145
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:32,428
Oh, my God.

146
00:09:32,505 --> 00:09:34,598
- That's amazing.
- Well, they're not gonna see it that way

147
00:09:34,674 --> 00:09:37,040
once they realize it's gonna set
their construction back a few months

148
00:09:37,109 --> 00:09:38,371
while we excavate.

149
00:09:38,444 --> 00:09:39,741
Oh, and Beth?

150
00:09:39,812 --> 00:09:44,306
This could be something
worth presenting in Florence.

151
00:09:44,383 --> 00:09:46,283
What the fuck
do you want me to do, Robert?

152
00:09:46,352 --> 00:09:48,877
- I am here...
- I gotta hop, this guy's killing me.

153
00:09:48,955 --> 00:09:50,217
God, I love the mute button.

154
00:09:50,289 --> 00:09:52,814
There are five other calls
I can make here, Tommy.

155
00:09:52,892 --> 00:09:53,950
You gotta release me.

156
00:09:54,026 --> 00:09:55,220
I understand that, Bobby.

157
00:09:55,294 --> 00:09:56,556
Just give me one second, okay?

158
00:09:56,629 --> 00:09:59,120
Hey, Shakes, this guy's
a really good client.

159
00:09:59,198 --> 00:10:00,495
You can't just put this up for me?

160
00:10:00,566 --> 00:10:02,056
I don't care if he's the fucking Pope.

161
00:10:02,134 --> 00:10:03,965
How do I know he's
not gonna fuck me over?

162
00:10:04,036 --> 00:10:06,061
I'm hanging up, Tommy.

163
00:10:06,138 --> 00:10:07,400
Okay, one call.

164
00:10:07,473 --> 00:10:09,270
Then you can go and let
every other loser on Wall Street

165
00:10:09,342 --> 00:10:10,707
fuck this up for you, okay?

166
00:10:10,776 --> 00:10:13,973
Fine. But keep me on the wire
and don't fucking mute me.

167
00:10:14,046 --> 00:10:17,106
Okay. Baker, didn't you say you had
a big seller the other day?

168
00:10:17,183 --> 00:10:19,674
Yeah, Pacific. We're still
in the penalty box with him.

169
00:10:19,752 --> 00:10:22,721
Okay, you know what?
Give him to me.

170
00:10:22,788 --> 00:10:24,813
Page five.

171
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:29,022
You know you guys
are still cut off, right?

172
00:10:29,095 --> 00:10:30,653
Hey. This is actually Tom Fielding.

173
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:32,061
I run the sales desk over here.

174
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:33,962
How you doing, Tom?
John Caldwell.

175
00:10:34,033 --> 00:10:36,297
I was calling to ask
a yes or no question, all right?

176
00:10:36,369 --> 00:10:37,358
Fine.

177
00:10:37,436 --> 00:10:39,063
Are you potentially interested

178
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:41,504
in trading Microsoft today, yes or no?

179
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:45,770
Potentially.
But not with you guys.

180
00:10:45,845 --> 00:10:47,335
Bobby, this is gonna happen.

181
00:10:47,413 --> 00:10:48,971
Now, just FYI,

182
00:10:49,048 --> 00:10:50,913
I have a guy looking
for a pretty big chunk.

183
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:52,211
Maybe half a mil.

184
00:10:52,284 --> 00:10:56,050
- Does that interest you?
- Potentially. Sure.

185
00:10:56,122 --> 00:10:59,353
Unfortunately, John, I don't have
the luxury of a lot of time here.

186
00:10:59,458 --> 00:11:01,892
My guy's real.
He's on the phone for one call.

187
00:11:01,927 --> 00:11:03,519
And that's you. Half a mil?

188
00:11:03,596 --> 00:11:07,555
On the wire, last print, in or out?

189
00:11:08,934 --> 00:11:09,958
Put it up.

190
00:11:10,036 --> 00:11:12,197
Great. Now, this is just me asking.

191
00:11:12,271 --> 00:11:13,499
Would you be able to go larger?

192
00:11:13,572 --> 00:11:14,869
Hey, half a mil,
trying to go bigger.

193
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:17,841
- Are you trying to front run me?
- No.

194
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:20,003
You just gotta trust me,
just a little bit, okay, John?

195
00:11:22,748 --> 00:11:23,715
Two million.

196
00:11:23,783 --> 00:11:25,717
Could go to two million here.

197
00:11:25,785 --> 00:11:27,218
No, it's not Bill Gates on the line.

198
00:11:27,286 --> 00:11:29,220
He's a mutual fund guy,
just like you.

199
00:11:29,288 --> 00:11:31,153
Well, he's got a lot more hair
and he's a little better looking.

200
00:11:31,223 --> 00:11:32,713
Fine. Make it read two.

201
00:11:32,792 --> 00:11:34,384
Okay. Is two million your total picture?

202
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:36,690
Why? Is he trying to move more?

203
00:11:38,264 --> 00:11:40,061
What's he saying.
Are we done here? Let's go!

204
00:11:40,132 --> 00:11:42,259
Is he trying to move more?

205
00:11:46,038 --> 00:11:48,563
All right, gentlemen,
I'm on the phone with both you right now.

206
00:11:48,641 --> 00:11:50,836
I think this ticket reads five million
and we all walk away.

207
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:51,877
That be on a cleanup?

208
00:11:51,944 --> 00:11:53,138
I knew he had more behind that.

209
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:54,304
You're a genius.
Seriously, Bobby,

210
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:55,972
is this a cleanup for you?
No bullshit.

211
00:11:56,048 --> 00:11:59,449
Five million, I go home and fuck
my Polish housekeeper twice.

212
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:01,076
It's a cleanup, John.

213
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,417
Okay, fine.

214
00:12:02,488 --> 00:12:04,080
Put it up.
But, oh, Tom?

215
00:12:04,156 --> 00:12:06,181
You'll still be in the box
for a week, though.

216
00:12:07,426 --> 00:12:09,451
Cross at five million, clean.

217
00:12:09,528 --> 00:12:11,519
See how far a little trust can get you?

218
00:12:13,866 --> 00:12:15,834
Another record down today
on Wall Street today

219
00:12:15,901 --> 00:12:17,300
with all major indexes...

220
00:12:19,538 --> 00:12:22,632
The Bargello and Accademia
are great, but skip the Uffizi.

221
00:12:22,708 --> 00:12:23,970
What about those Botticellis?

222
00:12:24,043 --> 00:12:26,307
And Michelangelo's only oil painting?

223
00:12:26,378 --> 00:12:28,437
There's a reason he stopped after one.
It's just for tourists.

224
00:12:28,514 --> 00:12:30,778
I am a tourist.

225
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:32,442
Hi.

226
00:12:32,518 --> 00:12:34,349
Is everything okay?

227
00:12:36,021 --> 00:12:37,352
Why?

228
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:38,788
What happened?

229
00:12:38,858 --> 00:12:42,658
Funding constraints.
The agency cut all international travel.

230
00:12:44,997 --> 00:12:48,364
So, what's the good news?

231
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:53,636
How would you like to be
head of urban conservation?

232
00:12:53,706 --> 00:12:56,266
- You're quitting?
- Not here.

233
00:12:56,342 --> 00:12:58,105
In San Francisco.

234
00:13:10,089 --> 00:13:11,784
Hey. Where were you?

235
00:13:11,857 --> 00:13:14,621
I'm sorry. I just changed now
and I'm on the way.

236
00:13:14,693 --> 00:13:16,320
- Are you still up?
- It's 10:00.

237
00:13:16,395 --> 00:13:18,590
- What happened?
- If I have to listen

238
00:13:18,664 --> 00:13:19,961
to one more hedge fund douchebag

239
00:13:20,032 --> 00:13:21,727
talk to me about private jet timeshares,

240
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:23,894
I swear to God I'm gonna
shoot myself in the face.

241
00:13:23,969 --> 00:13:26,494
Yeah, well, my trip
got canceled today.

242
00:13:28,107 --> 00:13:29,665
Grab your stuff
and meet me downstairs.

243
00:13:29,742 --> 00:13:30,674
Huh?

244
00:13:30,743 --> 00:13:33,234
- Grab your stuff.
- Where are we going?

245
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:36,213
Don't worry about it.

246
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:40,142
All right. Step out.

247
00:13:40,219 --> 00:13:41,811
Okay.

248
00:13:41,887 --> 00:13:44,617
And one big step up.

249
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:46,749
Right there.
I'm gonna take this off you.

250
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:48,157
You gotta keep
your eyes closed, okay?

251
00:13:48,227 --> 00:13:49,626
Are you sure we're still in the city?

252
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:52,061
Yeah, just... just...

253
00:13:52,131 --> 00:13:53,894
- Here.
- Here we go.

254
00:13:53,966 --> 00:13:56,025
- Great.
- Eyes closed.

255
00:13:56,101 --> 00:14:00,834
I'll be keeping an eye on you.

256
00:14:05,144 --> 00:14:06,133
No peeking.

257
00:14:06,212 --> 00:14:07,144
I'm not.

258
00:14:07,213 --> 00:14:09,044
- I saw that.
- What?

259
00:14:09,114 --> 00:14:10,979
You peek again,
I'm gonna take you home.

260
00:14:17,089 --> 00:14:19,080
- Keep them closed.
- Okay.

261
00:14:19,158 --> 00:14:20,625
Almost there.

262
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:22,661
All right, turn this way.

263
00:14:22,728 --> 00:14:25,891
Now, open your eyes.

264
00:14:25,965 --> 00:14:28,798
Oh, my God.
Where are we?

265
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:31,234
It's as close to Tuscany
as I could get in Manhattan.

266
00:14:33,038 --> 00:14:34,972
Come on.
Come on, this way.

267
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,837
It gets better.

268
00:14:37,977 --> 00:14:40,537
- Come on.
- This is so beautiful.

269
00:14:46,685 --> 00:14:49,279
How did you find this place?

270
00:14:49,355 --> 00:14:52,381
You know.
I gotta keep some surprises.

271
00:14:58,664 --> 00:15:01,258
I'm sorry your trip got canceled.

272
00:15:01,333 --> 00:15:03,164
Thank you.

273
00:15:05,271 --> 00:15:06,898
One more surprise.

274
00:15:15,447 --> 00:15:17,381
May I have this dance?

275
00:15:17,449 --> 00:15:19,883
Yes.

276
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:42,500
Wait.

277
00:15:44,109 --> 00:15:46,703
I think I have something.

278
00:15:54,219 --> 00:15:56,517
I just didn't want to be one of those girls

279
00:15:56,588 --> 00:15:58,021
who sleeps with a lot of guys.

280
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:02,188
I don't want you to sleep
with a lot of guys.

281
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:07,260
Right.

282
00:16:07,333 --> 00:16:08,322
I'll do it.

283
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:13,097
- Other way.
- Oh, sorry.

284
00:16:19,545 --> 00:16:21,376
Okay.

285
00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:35,283
Yeah, Frank,
you are all done for the day.

286
00:16:35,361 --> 00:16:37,329
No, thank you.

287
00:16:37,396 --> 00:16:40,854
That is 100,000 CRM
to Williams for the day.

288
00:16:40,933 --> 00:16:42,400
And Shakespeare,

289
00:16:42,468 --> 00:16:45,232
have I ever told you
how handsome you are?

290
00:16:45,304 --> 00:16:46,532
Somebody's in a good mood today.

291
00:16:46,605 --> 00:16:48,004
- Tom.
- Yep?

292
00:16:48,073 --> 00:16:49,836
Got a second?

293
00:17:07,659 --> 00:17:08,853
So, what's up?

294
00:17:11,263 --> 00:17:13,060
I got an offer from another firm.

295
00:17:15,601 --> 00:17:17,660
About twice what I'm making here.

296
00:17:19,438 --> 00:17:21,906
I don't know what to say.

297
00:17:21,974 --> 00:17:24,636
I mean, I'd hate to lose you,
but if I go to Cash with this,

298
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:26,769
especially right now,
the way things are,

299
00:17:26,845 --> 00:17:29,507
he might agree to a little kiss,
but a double?

300
00:17:29,581 --> 00:17:31,344
No way.

301
00:17:31,417 --> 00:17:33,783
I know, I figured.

302
00:17:33,852 --> 00:17:36,480
All right, look.

303
00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:38,819
You gotta do what's right for you.

304
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:40,290
Are you thinking about taking it?

305
00:17:43,195 --> 00:17:44,958
You already did.

306
00:17:47,433 --> 00:17:49,697
Well, man, what can I say?
It's been a great run.

307
00:17:49,768 --> 00:17:52,293
It's gonna be tough to replace you.

308
00:18:09,721 --> 00:18:11,951
I like that a lot.

309
00:18:12,024 --> 00:18:14,458
Listen, I gotta go, okay?

310
00:18:14,526 --> 00:18:16,517
No, you hang up first.

311
00:18:16,595 --> 00:18:18,893
No, you hang up.

312
00:18:18,964 --> 00:18:21,933
Twenty-one-year-old physical therapist.

313
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,332
Thousand bucks a month
for a studio on the Upper East Side.

314
00:18:24,403 --> 00:18:26,701
- A home run.
- Sounds like it.

315
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:29,297
You gotta see her.
She's so fucking hot.

316
00:18:29,374 --> 00:18:31,968
You should invite her to your place
for the mid-year dinner.

317
00:18:32,044 --> 00:18:34,012
Yeah. She can sit
right next to my wife.

318
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:36,104
Can you imagine?

319
00:18:36,181 --> 00:18:37,739
Who you bringing, hotshot?

320
00:18:37,816 --> 00:18:39,477
That Christie girl still in the picture?

321
00:18:39,551 --> 00:18:41,519
No. Beth. You met her at the golf event.

322
00:18:41,587 --> 00:18:42,918
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah.

323
00:18:42,988 --> 00:18:44,649
That brunette who wouldn't fuck you.

324
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:49,185
Listen, can I just talk to you off the desk,
just for a second?

325
00:18:50,395 --> 00:18:52,955
So, she did fuck you.

326
00:18:53,031 --> 00:18:55,693
How long was that woman,
like, two months or something?

327
00:18:55,767 --> 00:18:57,598
Jesus, that girl was your sexual Vietnam.

328
00:18:57,703 --> 00:18:58,863
Not saying a word.

329
00:19:01,874 --> 00:19:03,967
And so you just let him walk out.

330
00:19:04,042 --> 00:19:07,239
He's your top guy for two years.

331
00:19:07,312 --> 00:19:09,405
He already took the job.
He didn't want to make a scene.

332
00:19:09,481 --> 00:19:11,244
Well, there's gonna be
a big fucking scene tomorrow,

333
00:19:11,316 --> 00:19:13,807
when 20 of our biggest accounts call
and no one's answering the fucking phone.

334
00:19:13,886 --> 00:19:15,046
We'll hire someone else.

335
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:17,884
That will take weeks.

336
00:19:19,691 --> 00:19:21,454
Why the fuck didn't you let me talk to him?

337
00:19:21,527 --> 00:19:23,461
I could convince that fucking
cocksucker to stay.

338
00:19:23,529 --> 00:19:25,156
They guaranteed him two million a year
for two years,

339
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:27,357
- plus upside.
- How much are we paying him?

340
00:19:27,432 --> 00:19:30,367
Seven fifty this year...
a buck, tops.

341
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:33,904
Yeah, okay, we were too low.

342
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,305
All right, mister head of sales,
what's your contingency plan?

343
00:19:37,376 --> 00:19:40,777
I'm sure you have one.

344
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:42,370
I think Daniel can step up.

345
00:19:45,384 --> 00:19:48,182
Are you out of your fucking mind?

346
00:19:48,253 --> 00:19:50,153
That guy couldn't sell vagina
on a pirate ship.

347
00:19:50,222 --> 00:19:52,986
- He's smart, he's honest.
- He's too fucking honest.

348
00:19:53,058 --> 00:19:54,582
He's a fucking retarded Boy Scout.

349
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:56,787
That is exactly what
you said about Shakespeare.

350
00:19:56,862 --> 00:19:58,489
- Tommy. - It's exactly what
you said about Chris Baker.

351
00:19:58,564 --> 00:20:01,226
Tommy, Tommy, Tommy,
Tommy, Tommy, Tommy.

352
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:08,200
Why are guys like us good at our job?

353
00:20:08,273 --> 00:20:10,241
Because people like us.
We take them out, they have a good time.

354
00:20:10,309 --> 00:20:11,571
They might even meet a real, live girl.

355
00:20:11,643 --> 00:20:13,338
Daniel is a lovely fellow.

356
00:20:13,412 --> 00:20:15,209
He's as much fun as chlamydia.

357
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,407
I'm telling you this will work.

358
00:20:19,117 --> 00:20:22,211
Let me remind you the value we place
on human capital here at Morgan Brothers.

359
00:20:22,287 --> 00:20:23,777
- Your future...
- I understand.

360
00:20:23,855 --> 00:20:27,689
Your future depends
on the depth and the quality

361
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:30,956
of the team that you build.

362
00:20:31,029 --> 00:20:33,327
Now, in light of that,

363
00:20:33,398 --> 00:20:35,423
I'll ask you once.

364
00:20:36,468 --> 00:20:39,369
Is Daniel your guy?

365
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:45,600
Yes.

366
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:49,504
Great.

367
00:20:51,683 --> 00:20:53,446
I'm telling you, this
chick I'm banging in HR

368
00:20:53,518 --> 00:20:55,816
said that he was discharged
early from the Air Force.

369
00:20:55,887 --> 00:20:58,253
- And they sealed his file. Yes.
- Hey, hey.

370
00:20:58,357 --> 00:21:00,621
- Ha-ha!
- Look, all I'm saying is

371
00:21:00,659 --> 00:21:03,059
we need someone to fill
Baker's spot immediately.

372
00:21:03,128 --> 00:21:06,120
And if we let Cash pick one of his guys,

373
00:21:06,198 --> 00:21:08,257
we're all gonna be watching our asses.

374
00:21:08,333 --> 00:21:10,563
I'm just not buying
this nice guy act, all right?

375
00:21:10,636 --> 00:21:13,901
Nobody joins the military,
much less Wall Street,

376
00:21:13,972 --> 00:21:16,463
without having, you know,
some kind of a dark side.

377
00:21:16,541 --> 00:21:19,135
You're right, Wall Street is no place
for an ambitious white male.

378
00:21:19,211 --> 00:21:21,179
Of questionable integrity.

379
00:21:21,246 --> 00:21:22,804
Well, I think it's gonna be great.

380
00:21:22,881 --> 00:21:24,781
Yeah, of course you do, Stephens.

381
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:27,148
Finally, someone on the desk
that gets less ass than you.

382
00:21:27,219 --> 00:21:28,584
All right, that settles it.

383
00:21:28,654 --> 00:21:30,713
I'm leaving my wife of ten years

384
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:33,257
and I'm moving in on Steve-O's couch.

385
00:21:33,325 --> 00:21:35,259
- Who said you could have my couch?
- Did you say ten years?

386
00:21:35,327 --> 00:21:37,352
You get married when you were, like, 24?

387
00:21:37,429 --> 00:21:39,761
Yeah, I met here when I was 22.
I got married at 24.

388
00:21:39,831 --> 00:21:42,959
- Christ on a bun.
- You know, it's just different.

389
00:21:43,035 --> 00:21:44,832
- I'm sure I'll be there soon enough.
- Yeah.

390
00:21:44,903 --> 00:21:46,268
Sorry I'm late.

391
00:21:46,338 --> 00:21:49,034
- Hey.
- We're doing this whole system upgrade.

392
00:21:49,107 --> 00:21:51,302
And we can only reset the servers
after you guys leave.

393
00:21:51,376 --> 00:21:55,107
Plus the new software rollout
is taking forever.

394
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:58,547
Right. Daniel, you know Chris Baker's
no longer with the firm, right?

395
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:01,551
Yeah, I heard.

396
00:22:01,586 --> 00:22:05,044
- That sucks.
- Yeah, it does.

397
00:22:05,123 --> 00:22:06,818
We've been talking.

398
00:22:06,892 --> 00:22:08,587
And we thought that...

399
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:10,321
you'd be the right guy
to step into his spot.

400
00:22:10,395 --> 00:22:11,794
Starting immediately.

401
00:22:11,863 --> 00:22:14,297
- Wow.
- Yeah, wow.

402
00:22:15,701 --> 00:22:17,362
- He's got a lot of big accounts, though.
- Don't worry.

403
00:22:17,436 --> 00:22:18,733
We'll split them up.

404
00:22:18,804 --> 00:22:20,897
This is a bit of a
sink-or-swim business, mate.

405
00:22:20,972 --> 00:22:22,633
Opportunities like this,
they don't come knocking often.

406
00:22:22,708 --> 00:22:24,505
Yeah.

407
00:22:24,576 --> 00:22:26,544
Look, I mean, we'll all
be there to help you out

408
00:22:26,611 --> 00:22:27,839
till you get your legs under you.

409
00:22:27,913 --> 00:22:29,540
You're gonna be
an old pro in no time.

410
00:22:29,614 --> 00:22:31,013
- All right.
- We got you.

411
00:22:31,083 --> 00:22:32,141
Thanks, Tommy.

412
00:22:32,217 --> 00:22:33,479
I'm not gonna let you guys down.

413
00:22:33,552 --> 00:22:35,452
Good. Sorry, guys, couldn't resist.

414
00:22:36,722 --> 00:22:38,519
Here. Don't worry about it, drink it.

415
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:41,081
No, no, I fucking hate tequila, Tommy.

416
00:22:41,159 --> 00:22:43,320
- This is the good stuff.
- Hey, do you have any lime?

417
00:22:43,395 --> 00:22:44,885
Doesn't even taste like tequila.

418
00:22:44,963 --> 00:22:46,191
Jeez. Here's to Daniel.

419
00:22:46,264 --> 00:22:47,322
- All right.
- Welcome on board.

420
00:22:50,502 --> 00:22:52,527
That fucking tastes like tequila.

421
00:22:52,604 --> 00:22:53,593
Tastes like honey.

422
00:22:53,672 --> 00:22:55,970
I'm just saying that if I were black,

423
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:57,508
I'd just want to be called black.

424
00:22:57,609 --> 00:22:59,702
You know?
It just sounds so cool.

425
00:22:59,745 --> 00:23:00,939
Why would you say that?

426
00:23:01,012 --> 00:23:02,707
African-American just sounds
awkward and lame.

427
00:23:02,781 --> 00:23:04,305
- Why would you say that?
- It's okay.

428
00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:06,783
I'm allowed to speculate
about how I might feel.

429
00:23:06,852 --> 00:23:07,978
I'm also ethnic.

430
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:11,511
I mean, do you really prefer
to be called African-American?

431
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:13,990
You mean despite the fact
that I'm neither of those?

432
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:15,287
- Right.
- Okay.

433
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:18,989
Okay, so in England,
what do they call a black...

434
00:23:19,064 --> 00:23:20,793
Englishman.

435
00:23:20,866 --> 00:23:22,663
Who are you bringing
to Cash's mid-year dinner?

436
00:23:22,734 --> 00:23:25,066
- Who am I bringing?
- Yeah.

437
00:23:25,137 --> 00:23:26,764
I didn't know
I was supposed to bring a date.

438
00:23:26,838 --> 00:23:28,533
I didn't even know
I was supposed to go.

439
00:23:28,607 --> 00:23:31,337
Okay. Saturday. Homework.

440
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:34,106
Tomorrow. You guys with me.
I gotta go.

441
00:23:34,179 --> 00:23:36,704
Hey. Dust someone off.
It doesn't have to be anything special.

442
00:23:36,782 --> 00:23:39,273
- Ladies. Any chance, ladies?
- So, where are we gonna go now?

443
00:23:39,351 --> 00:23:41,512
Any, any chance whatsoever?

444
00:23:41,586 --> 00:23:44,111
I don't know, okay?
But it's Tuesday.

445
00:23:44,189 --> 00:23:45,554
- I can't stay out past 3.
- We have got to go.

446
00:23:45,624 --> 00:23:48,593
84th and 5th, please.

447
00:23:52,631 --> 00:23:54,394
Hey. How's it going with the new guy?

448
00:23:54,466 --> 00:23:55,398
He's fine.

449
00:23:55,467 --> 00:23:57,458
Just he's one of those lost souls

450
00:23:57,569 --> 00:23:59,537
that kind of dropped
off the grid for a little bit

451
00:23:59,571 --> 00:24:01,300
to find himself.

452
00:24:01,373 --> 00:24:03,204
I'm not so sure it worked.

453
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:04,708
Why do you want to hire him, then?

454
00:24:04,776 --> 00:24:05,936
No, I mean, he's smart.

455
00:24:06,011 --> 00:24:07,672
And he's a fucking computer genius.

456
00:24:07,746 --> 00:24:10,180
I mean, maybe all those stupid
Army training commercials were true.

457
00:24:10,248 --> 00:24:12,011
Hey, so, you coming over?

458
00:24:12,083 --> 00:24:13,311
I wish I could. I just...

459
00:24:13,385 --> 00:24:17,754
I gotta get up early tomorrow
to cover for Chris Baker.

460
00:24:17,823 --> 00:24:20,383
I'll call you tomorrow,
though, I promise. Okay?

461
00:24:20,459 --> 00:24:22,290
- Okay.
- Good night.

462
00:24:44,182 --> 00:24:45,706
Would you please
stop checking on me?

463
00:24:45,784 --> 00:24:47,342
Have you even talked
to anybody yet?

464
00:24:47,419 --> 00:24:48,943
I feel like a total perv.

465
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:51,750
The last girl I talked to was
in the prenatal care section.

466
00:24:51,823 --> 00:24:54,519
Hey. Bookstore was your idea.

467
00:24:54,593 --> 00:24:56,458
I know. It's just...

468
00:24:56,528 --> 00:24:57,756
not everyone is good at this stuff.

469
00:24:58,864 --> 00:25:02,027
All right, Daniel.
You are a great guy.

470
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:03,226
Okay?

471
00:25:03,301 --> 00:25:07,635
Any woman in this city
would be lucky to talk to a guy like you.

472
00:25:07,706 --> 00:25:09,503
Oh, my God.

473
00:25:09,574 --> 00:25:11,508
You should see this girl
who just got in the line.

474
00:25:11,576 --> 00:25:12,508
There you go.

475
00:25:12,577 --> 00:25:14,807
- Now go talk to her.
- I can't.

476
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:17,678
- What do I say? I don't know.
- It'll come to you.

477
00:25:17,749 --> 00:25:20,843
Just move before someone else
gets in line in front of you.

478
00:25:26,892 --> 00:25:28,154
Sorry.

479
00:25:34,633 --> 00:25:36,430
Where in Italy are you going?

480
00:25:38,637 --> 00:25:41,936
Oh. I'm not.

481
00:25:42,007 --> 00:25:44,339
I'm just returning this.

482
00:25:45,877 --> 00:25:49,938
That's too bad.
It's amazing there.

483
00:25:50,015 --> 00:25:52,779
Yeah. My trip there just got canceled,

484
00:25:52,851 --> 00:25:57,754
so that's not really what
I need to hear, but yeah.

485
00:25:59,524 --> 00:26:02,652
Did I say amazing?
I meant awful.

486
00:26:02,727 --> 00:26:04,092
Full of Italians.

487
00:26:04,162 --> 00:26:07,529
Does that help at all?

488
00:26:07,599 --> 00:26:09,396
Not really.

489
00:26:09,467 --> 00:26:11,492
Well, you know what,
you should keep it

490
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:14,130
and put it in a place
where you'll see it all the time,

491
00:26:14,205 --> 00:26:17,299
and that way you'll always be reminded

492
00:26:17,375 --> 00:26:19,275
about how much you want to go.

493
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:25,448
That might be the worst idea
I've ever heard.

494
00:26:25,517 --> 00:26:27,610
Yeah, but you know
you'd end up going.

495
00:26:27,686 --> 00:26:28,983
I mean, you know
what they say.

496
00:26:29,054 --> 00:26:33,252
If you forget your dreams,
it's like they never existed.

497
00:26:33,325 --> 00:26:35,793
Who says that?

498
00:26:38,229 --> 00:26:41,130
Nobody. I just made that up.

499
00:26:41,199 --> 00:26:42,666
But it's true.

500
00:26:44,202 --> 00:26:45,669
Next.

501
00:26:45,737 --> 00:26:47,762
Oh.

502
00:26:47,839 --> 00:26:51,969
You go ahead. I think
I might keep it, actually.

503
00:26:52,043 --> 00:26:54,102
Thanks.

504
00:26:54,179 --> 00:26:57,046
Next in line, please.

505
00:27:01,319 --> 00:27:04,311
Sir, can I help you?

506
00:27:04,389 --> 00:27:06,653
Oh, I need a book.

507
00:27:12,697 --> 00:27:14,255
So, question is

508
00:27:14,332 --> 00:27:16,926
which one of the three women
did he hire?

509
00:27:17,002 --> 00:27:18,970
The one who redecorated the office.

510
00:27:19,037 --> 00:27:21,733
- Wrong.
- The one who doubled their sales.

511
00:27:21,806 --> 00:27:23,774
Nope. Daniel?

512
00:27:23,842 --> 00:27:25,707
Then the one who loves children.

513
00:27:25,777 --> 00:27:27,335
No.

514
00:27:27,412 --> 00:27:30,438
The one with the biggest tits.

515
00:27:33,218 --> 00:27:35,686
That must be how Larry got the job.

516
00:27:35,754 --> 00:27:37,551
One look at these man-boobs
and I was in, huh?

517
00:27:42,494 --> 00:27:44,155
Hey, Daniel, you got any jokes?

518
00:27:44,229 --> 00:27:45,457
Yeah, let's hear from the new guy.

519
00:27:45,530 --> 00:27:47,998
Oh, I can never remember any jokes.

520
00:27:48,066 --> 00:27:50,466
Oh, come on.
You gotta know at least one.

521
00:27:50,535 --> 00:27:51,661
Yeah, come on, Daniel.

522
00:27:51,736 --> 00:27:55,365
Well, I guess I can think of one.

523
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:57,965
But it's so stupid.

524
00:27:58,076 --> 00:27:59,907
Come on, go ahead, tell it.

525
00:28:04,315 --> 00:28:06,112
Okay.

526
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:09,487
What do you call
a fish with two knees?

527
00:28:09,554 --> 00:28:11,215
I don't know. What?

528
00:28:11,289 --> 00:28:13,416
A two-knee fish.

529
00:28:16,828 --> 00:28:18,989
Like tuna, but...

530
00:28:19,064 --> 00:28:21,726
You have to think about it.

531
00:28:22,867 --> 00:28:25,233
That's a... That's a classic.

532
00:28:25,303 --> 00:28:27,737
- That's actually pretty good.
- That one, yeah.

533
00:28:27,806 --> 00:28:30,639
- Where are we going tonight?
- Should we just hit the usual petting zoo?

534
00:28:30,709 --> 00:28:32,506
No. No strip clubs tonight.

535
00:28:32,577 --> 00:28:34,101
Let's meet some civilians.

536
00:28:34,179 --> 00:28:35,942
Yeah. Hey, hey, Daniel?

537
00:28:36,014 --> 00:28:37,538
You know any girls
who'll meet us out?

538
00:28:37,615 --> 00:28:39,742
Yeah, who you got on speed dial?

539
00:28:39,818 --> 00:28:42,446
I don't know a lot of women
I can just call up like that.

540
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:44,715
Well, okay.
Where's the hot spot?

541
00:28:44,789 --> 00:28:45,949
You know, Wednesday nights.

542
00:28:47,192 --> 00:28:49,558
Wednesday?

543
00:28:49,627 --> 00:28:51,857
I don't really go out much on Wednesdays.

544
00:28:51,930 --> 00:28:54,421
Anymore.

545
00:28:54,499 --> 00:28:57,730
Anymore. This guy... Animal.

546
00:29:13,151 --> 00:29:14,413
- Nut?
- I'm okay.

547
00:29:14,486 --> 00:29:15,680
Thank you.

548
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:24,224
Pick up the phone, say hello.

549
00:29:26,498 --> 00:29:27,988
Go ahead, pick it up.

550
00:29:28,066 --> 00:29:29,499
There's no one there.

551
00:29:29,567 --> 00:29:31,660
Humor me.

552
00:29:36,107 --> 00:29:37,734
- Hello?
- Good.

553
00:29:37,809 --> 00:29:39,640
Hang it up and do it again.

554
00:29:43,515 --> 00:29:45,176
- Hello.
- Very nice.

555
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:47,445
Pretty easy, huh?
Really fucking easy.

556
00:29:47,519 --> 00:29:49,043
But I don't pay my salesmen
millions of dollars

557
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,644
to answer the phone.

558
00:29:50,722 --> 00:29:53,316
I pay them to make it ring.

559
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:58,258
Billy Simmons called today.

560
00:29:58,329 --> 00:30:00,797
He doesn't want Daniel to cover them.

561
00:30:00,865 --> 00:30:02,799
Any idea why?

562
00:30:02,867 --> 00:30:04,198
They're very different people.

563
00:30:05,737 --> 00:30:07,830
You are on...
Sit the fuck down.

564
00:30:09,808 --> 00:30:11,435
You are only going
to bat for that guy

565
00:30:11,509 --> 00:30:14,740
because you know
that you will own him.

566
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:18,772
You can fool everybody else, Tom,
but you can't fool me.

567
00:30:18,850 --> 00:30:20,750
He's the type of guy
I want on my team.

568
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:23,287
- He's honest, loyal...
- Like Chris Baker?

569
00:30:24,956 --> 00:30:27,584
Make no mistake,
Daniel will throw you under a fucking bus

570
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:29,320
the first day he gets a chance.

571
00:30:29,394 --> 00:30:31,328
This is not sleepaway camp, Tommy.

572
00:30:31,396 --> 00:30:34,695
Your job is to make me rich. Period.

573
00:30:34,766 --> 00:30:37,200
Now, however you're gonna get
that guy a fucking personality,

574
00:30:37,268 --> 00:30:39,463
<i>you better do it fast,
or I'm gonna fire his Rainman ass</i>

575
00:30:39,537 --> 00:30:43,496
and get somebody in there
who does want to take your job.

576
00:30:54,219 --> 00:30:57,552
Yeah. Yeah, I'm sorry.
I just... I crashed last night.

577
00:30:57,655 --> 00:30:59,782
Cash is killing me about Daniel.

578
00:30:59,824 --> 00:31:01,485
Really? What's wrong with him?

579
00:31:01,559 --> 00:31:03,254
He's like Forrest fucking Gump.

580
00:31:03,328 --> 00:31:05,694
Without the people skills.

581
00:31:05,763 --> 00:31:07,731
I'm heading to SoHo
right now to work on him.

582
00:31:07,799 --> 00:31:09,699
I thought we were gonna
spend the day in the park.

583
00:31:09,767 --> 00:31:12,930
Beth, please. I'm being pulled
in a ton of different directions right now.

584
00:31:13,004 --> 00:31:17,236
Fine. But I need to be
a priority too sometimes.

585
00:31:17,308 --> 00:31:19,538
I'll call you later, I promise.

586
00:31:22,747 --> 00:31:24,374
Doesn't matter what
you talk about at first,

587
00:31:24,449 --> 00:31:27,350
just show the woman
that you are passionate about something.

588
00:31:27,418 --> 00:31:29,215
Like what?

589
00:31:29,287 --> 00:31:31,619
It's your life.
You tell me.

590
00:31:31,689 --> 00:31:34,249
I don't know.

591
00:31:34,325 --> 00:31:35,758
Okay. You like to read, right?

592
00:31:35,827 --> 00:31:38,762
- Yeah.
- What do you love to read?

593
00:31:40,064 --> 00:31:42,828
Dickens, Tolstoy.

594
00:31:42,901 --> 00:31:44,425
- I like Austen, Jane Austen.
- Okay, classics.

595
00:31:44,502 --> 00:31:47,164
Might be a little brainy
to start out with.

596
00:31:47,238 --> 00:31:49,433
So let's see, what else?

597
00:31:49,507 --> 00:31:53,068
I can give you the flight specs

598
00:31:53,144 --> 00:31:55,772
for every domestic aircraft since 1950.

599
00:31:58,316 --> 00:32:00,807
Classics.
Let's talk more about those.

600
00:32:00,885 --> 00:32:02,819
Talk about books she might like.

601
00:32:02,887 --> 00:32:06,220
But be careful, 'cause you can't act,
look, and talk all like the same guy.

602
00:32:06,291 --> 00:32:07,758
You gotta mix it up.

603
00:32:07,825 --> 00:32:09,315
What does that mean?

604
00:32:09,394 --> 00:32:11,726
Just if you were a surfer,
be a surfer who likes to read.

605
00:32:11,796 --> 00:32:14,196
If you're a dork, be a dork
who likes to salsa dance.

606
00:32:14,265 --> 00:32:15,323
You know? Just...

607
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,890
If you act boring
and you look boring,

608
00:32:16,968 --> 00:32:17,992
guess what?

609
00:32:18,069 --> 00:32:20,162
You're boring.
What are you doing?

610
00:32:20,238 --> 00:32:21,933
Tommy, this sounds ridiculous.

611
00:32:22,006 --> 00:32:23,769
It's totally fucking ridiculous,
you know?

612
00:32:23,841 --> 00:32:25,433
I'm not telling you
the way things should be.

613
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:26,670
I'm telling you how they are.

614
00:32:26,744 --> 00:32:29,076
And unfortunately, a woman,
within three seconds,

615
00:32:29,147 --> 00:32:31,138
is gonna notice whether or not
your shoes match your pants

616
00:32:31,215 --> 00:32:32,614
or your shirt's buttoned up too high

617
00:32:32,684 --> 00:32:34,174
or it's tucked in when it shouldn't be

618
00:32:34,252 --> 00:32:37,551
or you have a cell phone
attached to your woven belt.

619
00:32:37,622 --> 00:32:39,647
This is...
Look, when you were overseas,

620
00:32:39,724 --> 00:32:42,625
didn't you find any, like,
really cool clothes?

621
00:32:42,694 --> 00:32:45,288
You want me to wear
a sarong to work?

622
00:32:45,363 --> 00:32:48,491
Look, I can't stand guys that try
to make a statement with what they wear.

623
00:32:48,566 --> 00:32:50,761
- It's not me.
- Daniel.

624
00:32:50,835 --> 00:32:55,295
I'm not trying to turn you into some
big city, man cougar prick like Cash

625
00:32:55,373 --> 00:32:56,965
or any of those guys.

626
00:32:57,041 --> 00:32:58,303
All I'm saying is, unfortunately,

627
00:32:58,409 --> 00:33:00,036
what you wear does
make a statement to women,

628
00:33:00,078 --> 00:33:03,241
and your statement right now is,

629
00:33:03,314 --> 00:33:05,646
"Hi. Welcome to Blockbuster."

630
00:33:05,717 --> 00:33:07,708
We're going in here.

631
00:33:14,759 --> 00:33:15,885
Can you help this guy out?

632
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:18,292
What did you have in mind

633
00:33:18,363 --> 00:33:21,526
for little Tommy Hilfiger here?

634
00:33:21,599 --> 00:33:22,998
Just something he can wear out in public.

635
00:33:23,067 --> 00:33:24,796
I'm right here, guys.

636
00:33:24,869 --> 00:33:26,803
I can hear what you're saying.

637
00:33:26,871 --> 00:33:28,964
Maybe something casual sexy.

638
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:32,203
- Sounds about right.
- How sexy?

639
00:33:34,712 --> 00:33:36,179
Medium.

640
00:33:36,247 --> 00:33:39,239
Or small sexy.

641
00:33:39,317 --> 00:33:40,784
Tommy, you didn't have to pay for this.

642
00:33:40,852 --> 00:33:42,149
No, it's worth it.

643
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:44,654
Hey, I forgot my clothes.

644
00:33:44,722 --> 00:33:46,280
- Yeah. Leave them.
- Yeah, but those are Banana Republic.

645
00:33:46,357 --> 00:33:47,346
Exactly.

646
00:33:53,598 --> 00:33:56,192
You still haven't told Tommy
about San Francisco?

647
00:33:56,267 --> 00:33:57,825
Fuck.

648
00:33:57,935 --> 00:33:59,630
I keep putting it off.

649
00:33:59,670 --> 00:34:02,264
It would just put
so much pressure on things.

650
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:03,705
Yeah, but you're running out of time.

651
00:34:06,077 --> 00:34:08,409
God, I hope my fucking vibrator
appreciates this.

652
00:34:08,479 --> 00:34:10,003
Hey, isn't Lisa supposed to be here?

653
00:34:10,081 --> 00:34:12,709
I don't know, maybe she didn't want
to have her vagina torn off.

654
00:34:12,784 --> 00:34:15,184
- Hello?
- Hey, where are you?

655
00:34:15,253 --> 00:34:17,016
I'm home.

656
00:34:17,088 --> 00:34:18,783
Can you guys come over?

657
00:34:18,856 --> 00:34:21,416
- Yeah, what's wrong?
- Oh, bitch fucker.

658
00:34:21,492 --> 00:34:24,325
Bill left his email account
open on his computer.

659
00:34:25,563 --> 00:34:27,121
We'll be right there.

660
00:34:27,198 --> 00:34:29,826
Don't go early.
Don't go early.

661
00:34:29,901 --> 00:34:31,129
Don't go early.

662
00:34:33,371 --> 00:34:34,702
Ow, son of a bitch!

663
00:34:34,772 --> 00:34:37,070
Steve-O, you're at, like, a ten.

664
00:34:37,141 --> 00:34:40,076
I need you down
at a shut the fuck up.

665
00:34:40,144 --> 00:34:41,270
Fuck right off, okay?

666
00:34:41,345 --> 00:34:42,369
Come on, let's go again.

667
00:34:42,447 --> 00:34:44,608
- Does it hurt that bad?
- There you go. Shot.

668
00:34:44,682 --> 00:34:48,140
- Refill. Jesus.
- All right, now, everybody listen, listen.

669
00:34:48,219 --> 00:34:49,243
- Daniel?
- Yes.

670
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:50,685
What have you learned today?

671
00:34:50,755 --> 00:34:53,986
To show your customers
that they want something

672
00:34:54,058 --> 00:34:55,787
- that you have and...
- No sales pitch, right?

673
00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:57,122
People see that shit coming
a mile away, right?

674
00:34:57,195 --> 00:34:58,492
How do you do it?

675
00:34:58,596 --> 00:35:00,291
Fuck me!

676
00:35:00,331 --> 00:35:01,958
What is wrong
with the American people?

677
00:35:02,033 --> 00:35:03,557
I don't know.

678
00:35:03,634 --> 00:35:04,623
How do you do it?

679
00:35:04,702 --> 00:35:05,828
- How do I do it?
- Yeah.

680
00:35:05,903 --> 00:35:07,666
Never kiss someone's ass.

681
00:35:07,738 --> 00:35:09,672
- You're better off just fucking with them.
- It's a lot more fun.

682
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:13,335
Okay, so first thing Monday morning
I'm gonna call all my accounts and say,

683
00:35:13,411 --> 00:35:16,869
"Hey, you fat fucks,
you wanna buy some stock?"

684
00:35:18,483 --> 00:35:20,212
Was that a joke?

685
00:35:20,284 --> 00:35:21,842
- It was bad, I'm sorry.
- You're not even listening.

686
00:35:21,919 --> 00:35:23,443
- I need you to focus, okay?
- Sorry.

687
00:35:23,521 --> 00:35:24,920
All right, and stop apologizing so much.

688
00:35:24,989 --> 00:35:27,014
Sorry. Shit.

689
00:35:27,091 --> 00:35:29,116
Look, the reason these rules
are important is because

690
00:35:29,193 --> 00:35:31,184
they're the same rules
that apply to meeting women,

691
00:35:31,262 --> 00:35:33,162
which is even more important
for you to learn.

692
00:35:33,231 --> 00:35:35,722
Wait. Women don't actually
like being insulted.

693
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:38,166
That's misogynist bullshit.

694
00:35:38,236 --> 00:35:40,033
No. What women hate

695
00:35:40,104 --> 00:35:41,162
is getting lied to by guys

696
00:35:41,239 --> 00:35:42,638
who are just trying to sleep with them.

697
00:35:42,707 --> 00:35:44,675
What if I'm not just
trying to sleep with them?

698
00:35:44,742 --> 00:35:45,674
Then you're gay.

699
00:35:45,743 --> 00:35:47,870
Fuck!

700
00:35:49,213 --> 00:35:51,374
God, that actually hurts a lot.

701
00:35:51,449 --> 00:35:54,179
Had to get him distracted.
Here's to Iceman...

702
00:35:54,252 --> 00:35:56,880
not learning anything, ever.

703
00:35:56,954 --> 00:35:58,216
That's a horrible game.

704
00:35:58,322 --> 00:36:00,153
I think my sperm count
is officially lower.

705
00:36:00,191 --> 00:36:01,317
Let's do it again.

706
00:36:01,392 --> 00:36:04,054
All I'm saying is that obviously,

707
00:36:04,128 --> 00:36:05,425
something was really wrong

708
00:36:05,496 --> 00:36:06,986
if you were already that suspicious.

709
00:36:07,064 --> 00:36:08,463
Oh, but that doesn't give me the right

710
00:36:08,533 --> 00:36:10,524
to go snooping around like that.

711
00:36:10,601 --> 00:36:12,262
Oh, will you listen to yourself?

712
00:36:12,336 --> 00:36:13,598
Your boyfriend cheats on you

713
00:36:13,671 --> 00:36:15,571
and you're mad at yourself
for catching him.

714
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:17,403
People do make mistakes, Jordan.

715
00:36:17,475 --> 00:36:20,444
Locking your keys in the car
with the engine running is a mistake.

716
00:36:20,511 --> 00:36:22,069
Repeatedly fucking your ex-girlfriend
is not a mistake.

717
00:36:22,146 --> 00:36:23,238
Jordan, come on.

718
00:36:23,314 --> 00:36:25,248
He said it was only the one time.

719
00:36:25,316 --> 00:36:26,806
That is such bullshit.

720
00:36:26,884 --> 00:36:28,647
Infidelities are like cockroaches.

721
00:36:28,719 --> 00:36:30,653
For every one you catch,
there are a hundred you don't.

722
00:36:30,721 --> 00:36:32,712
Hey, you're not helping her right now.

723
00:36:32,790 --> 00:36:34,724
Can you just be supportive and not turn this

724
00:36:34,792 --> 00:36:36,817
into some stupid male-bashing session?

725
00:36:39,463 --> 00:36:41,226
Where's Tommy tonight?

726
00:36:43,768 --> 00:36:45,793
You know what your problem is?

727
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:47,633
You wouldn't know what to do

728
00:36:47,705 --> 00:36:50,173
if a great guy just threw himself at you.

729
00:36:50,241 --> 00:36:52,175
At least I'm giving myself
a chance to be happy.

730
00:36:52,243 --> 00:36:54,006
Maybe use your sensitive side.

731
00:36:54,078 --> 00:36:55,978
- Show that off.
- Yes.

732
00:36:56,047 --> 00:36:59,448
Use the fact that you are
a complete pussy to your advantage.

733
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:02,041
Coming from the guy
that brought the piata and the blindfold.

734
00:37:02,086 --> 00:37:03,053
Hit the thing.

735
00:37:05,056 --> 00:37:07,217
- What's pink?
- Xanax, man.

736
00:37:07,291 --> 00:37:08,588
You can take whatever you want

737
00:37:08,659 --> 00:37:10,092
and you'll sleep like a rock.

738
00:37:10,161 --> 00:37:12,459
- Yellow.
- Yellow is Ecstasy.

739
00:37:12,530 --> 00:37:14,259
I left my glow sticks back in 1997.

740
00:37:14,332 --> 00:37:17,631
- What's blue?
- Blue's Viagra.

741
00:37:17,702 --> 00:37:18,760
It's perfect for you.

742
00:37:18,836 --> 00:37:21,532
- I'm good, thanks.
- No, my friend.

743
00:37:21,606 --> 00:37:24,131
Power up, okay?
Like, the ladies expect it these days.

744
00:37:24,208 --> 00:37:26,039
Never take a knife
to a gunfight, mate.

745
00:37:26,110 --> 00:37:28,635
Gunfight. That's a nice metaphor.

746
00:37:28,713 --> 00:37:30,578
Don't listen to these guys.

747
00:37:30,648 --> 00:37:33,879
No tourists.

748
00:37:33,951 --> 00:37:36,715
You ready to be released
into the wild?

749
00:37:59,377 --> 00:38:01,106
Hey, guys.

750
00:38:01,178 --> 00:38:03,203
We got everybody.

751
00:38:18,095 --> 00:38:20,290
No, honey, we don't need these.

752
00:38:23,067 --> 00:38:24,932
She's beautiful.

753
00:38:25,002 --> 00:38:26,196
You think so?

754
00:38:26,270 --> 00:38:27,635
- Yeah.
- You should tell her.

755
00:38:27,705 --> 00:38:29,036
Do you have water?

756
00:38:29,106 --> 00:38:31,040
I'm sure she gets hit on
all the time, though.

757
00:38:31,108 --> 00:38:33,201
You're probably right,
she probably does get hit on all the time

758
00:38:33,277 --> 00:38:34,972
by guys who don't
actually care, you know,

759
00:38:35,046 --> 00:38:36,843
if she's a Gemini
or what her cat's name is.

760
00:38:36,914 --> 00:38:38,973
But I'm not asking you to go over there
and feed her a line.

761
00:38:39,050 --> 00:38:40,847
I just want you to go talk to her.

762
00:38:40,918 --> 00:38:42,613
You keep telling me what
I'm not supposed to do.

763
00:38:42,687 --> 00:38:44,177
I don't know what
I'm supposed to say.

764
00:38:44,255 --> 00:38:46,450
I'm in the low self-esteem business.

765
00:38:46,524 --> 00:38:49,220
If a girl's parents are still together,
I just move on.

766
00:38:49,293 --> 00:38:51,454
Doesn't really matter
what I say to women.

767
00:38:51,529 --> 00:38:52,962
I have an English accent.

768
00:38:53,030 --> 00:38:55,055
You know what? All right.

769
00:38:55,132 --> 00:38:57,566
Two girls, end of the bar.

770
00:38:57,668 --> 00:38:58,760
Go talk to them.

771
00:39:01,205 --> 00:39:02,536
Okay.

772
00:39:04,709 --> 00:39:07,143
- What, right now?
- Yeah, right now.

773
00:39:07,211 --> 00:39:08,235
Which one do you like better?

774
00:39:08,312 --> 00:39:09,336
I don't know.

775
00:39:10,815 --> 00:39:12,180
Blonde, I guess.

776
00:39:12,249 --> 00:39:13,716
- Rookie.
- Totally.

777
00:39:13,784 --> 00:39:17,015
No questions.
No questions, just go.

778
00:39:17,088 --> 00:39:19,022
Go.

779
00:39:19,090 --> 00:39:20,284
Wait, come back.
Come back.

780
00:39:20,358 --> 00:39:21,484
- What?
- That right there.

781
00:39:21,559 --> 00:39:24,119
What is that?
I told you about that.

782
00:39:24,195 --> 00:39:25,662
Okay, now go.

783
00:39:25,730 --> 00:39:28,893
Do you actually believe
any of that shit you just said?

784
00:39:28,966 --> 00:39:30,797
- Some of it.
- You think he's gonna pull it off?

785
00:39:30,868 --> 00:39:32,130
Not a fucking prayer.

786
00:39:38,876 --> 00:39:39,865
Excuse me.

787
00:39:44,281 --> 00:39:47,079
Pass me a napkin? Please?

788
00:39:48,319 --> 00:39:49,286
Thank you.

789
00:39:50,855 --> 00:39:51,879
De-entry.

790
00:39:56,427 --> 00:39:57,359
I feel stupid.

791
00:39:57,428 --> 00:39:58,360
You look stupid.

792
00:39:58,429 --> 00:39:59,726
Let me get this straight, Daniel.

793
00:39:59,797 --> 00:40:03,255
Okay? You could fly a jet
at Mach 3 speeds

794
00:40:03,334 --> 00:40:05,598
for, like, 72 hours with a plastic tube
up your cock,

795
00:40:05,669 --> 00:40:07,637
but you can't go talk
to two dental hygienists

796
00:40:07,705 --> 00:40:11,436
- for 10 seconds.
- Actually, I was an avionics engineer.

797
00:40:11,509 --> 00:40:13,238
- We never had...
- No. I don't... No excuses.

798
00:40:13,310 --> 00:40:14,572
You gotta be able to do this.

799
00:40:14,645 --> 00:40:15,703
You have to.

800
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:17,145
What about that one over there?

801
00:40:17,214 --> 00:40:19,944
- Oh, totally gross.
- And what about the blonde over there?

802
00:40:20,017 --> 00:40:21,484
I want to touch her where she pees.

803
00:40:21,552 --> 00:40:23,144
That is a good-looking white girl.

804
00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:24,585
Ring. Ring.

805
00:40:24,655 --> 00:40:25,986
Oh, fuck, you're right.

806
00:40:26,056 --> 00:40:27,956
Oh, how 'bout that one?

807
00:40:28,025 --> 00:40:30,289
- That's a handsome woman.
- Look at her ass.

808
00:40:30,361 --> 00:40:31,726
She might as well have a tail,

809
00:40:31,796 --> 00:40:32,785
and she's ugly.

810
00:40:32,863 --> 00:40:34,160
You know, some people
might say the way

811
00:40:34,231 --> 00:40:35,596
you guys talk about women is ugly.

812
00:40:35,666 --> 00:40:38,829
Yeah, but we're only ugly
on the inside, so it's okay.

813
00:40:38,903 --> 00:40:42,430
Oh, that... that is a beautiful woman.

814
00:40:42,506 --> 00:40:45,100
She totally wants to have
a sexy party with me.

815
00:40:45,176 --> 00:40:47,406
She does not want to have
a sexy party with you.

816
00:40:47,478 --> 00:40:49,503
She wants to have
a sexy party with me.

817
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:52,811
Steve-O, fine.
Go ahead. Talk to her.

818
00:40:52,883 --> 00:40:55,647
But none of that shock and awe bullshit
you usually pull.

819
00:40:55,719 --> 00:40:57,346
Someone has to show
Danny how to do this, okay?

820
00:40:57,421 --> 00:41:00,356
- You don't have to...
- I don't do that shit anymore, okay?

821
00:41:00,458 --> 00:41:01,823
Sexy party.

822
00:41:01,859 --> 00:41:04,191
Okay. None of that scorched earth bullshit.
I'm serious.

823
00:41:07,131 --> 00:41:10,362
Well, hello there, Rodeo.
Who's up for a Jager bomb?

824
00:41:11,635 --> 00:41:13,296
I don't think she's having it, mate.

825
00:41:13,370 --> 00:41:15,531
A Grey Goose and soda?
Yeah, just one.

826
00:41:15,606 --> 00:41:17,836
How 'bout you go talk to her?

827
00:41:17,908 --> 00:41:20,536
I don't think Cindy Brady's
coming over to the dark side tonight.

828
00:41:20,611 --> 00:41:22,545
I'm gonna go take a hot lap.

829
00:41:22,613 --> 00:41:24,376
Thanks for the help, Shakes.

830
00:41:24,448 --> 00:41:26,939
Well, your turn.

831
00:41:27,017 --> 00:41:29,884
- No. No.
- Your turn.

832
00:41:29,954 --> 00:41:31,945
Okay, fine. Okay.

833
00:41:32,022 --> 00:41:33,956
But remember, this is
not about sexy parties or...

834
00:41:34,024 --> 00:41:35,616
Whatever, just go talk to her.

835
00:41:35,693 --> 00:41:38,423
I'm gonna get
a front-row seat. Okay?

836
00:41:40,631 --> 00:41:41,893
I'm Steven, by the way.

837
00:41:41,966 --> 00:41:43,365
- I'm Brooke.
- Great.

838
00:41:43,434 --> 00:41:45,664
You look really professional up there.

839
00:41:45,736 --> 00:41:47,294
By which I mean you're, like, hot.

840
00:41:47,371 --> 00:41:49,362
Like, really hot.

841
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:51,032
Another napkin.

842
00:41:51,108 --> 00:41:52,973
Where's the bartender?

843
00:41:53,043 --> 00:41:55,136
- I hope I'm not interrupting.
- Yeah, you actually...

844
00:41:55,212 --> 00:41:57,703
- No, not at all. Hi.
- Hi.

845
00:41:57,815 --> 00:41:59,373
Tommy.

846
00:42:00,417 --> 00:42:03,181
- Yeah, This is Bl...
- I'm Brooke.

847
00:42:03,254 --> 00:42:04,346
- Blake?
- Brooke.

848
00:42:04,421 --> 00:42:05,581
- Brooke.
- Brooke.

849
00:42:05,656 --> 00:42:08,022
- Tommy. Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you too.

850
00:42:08,092 --> 00:42:09,923
So, how do you two
know each other?

851
00:42:09,994 --> 00:42:11,825
- Oh, we...
- Work.

852
00:42:11,896 --> 00:42:13,761
You write children's books too?

853
00:42:13,831 --> 00:42:16,959
Yeah. He does instructional guides

854
00:42:17,034 --> 00:42:19,093
for swing sets.

855
00:42:25,175 --> 00:42:27,871
- Well...
- Dude, that's my...

856
00:42:27,945 --> 00:42:30,778
Obviously, I'm not gonna
have sex with this girl tonight,

857
00:42:30,848 --> 00:42:33,442
so why don't you give it a shot?

858
00:42:35,219 --> 00:42:36,618
I am so sorry about that.

859
00:42:36,687 --> 00:42:38,177
What an asshole.

860
00:42:38,255 --> 00:42:41,588
- Yeah, I...
- What, you guys work on Wall Street?

861
00:42:41,659 --> 00:42:44,651
Yeah, we do,
but not all of us are like...

862
00:42:44,728 --> 00:42:46,389
You know what?

863
00:42:46,463 --> 00:42:47,987
Let's start over.
I am Tommy.

864
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:51,260
And I owe you a drink.

865
00:42:54,972 --> 00:42:56,064
I'm Brooke.

866
00:42:57,207 --> 00:42:59,107
It's a pleasure to meet you.

867
00:42:59,209 --> 00:43:02,906
Personally, I think there's
nothing wrong with bulimia at all.

868
00:43:02,947 --> 00:43:07,748
If anything, it shows your willingness
to reevaluate your decisions

869
00:43:07,818 --> 00:43:12,585
and be proactive about making changes.

870
00:43:12,656 --> 00:43:14,851
You don't sound black at all.

871
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:18,419
Are you from Europe?

872
00:43:18,495 --> 00:43:21,828
Here goes Jonathan,
looking to break some records.

873
00:43:24,535 --> 00:43:27,402
- Yeah!
- Here we go!

874
00:43:27,471 --> 00:43:29,132
That's gotta hurt.

875
00:43:29,206 --> 00:43:30,867
It doesn't look innocent,
it looks like heroin addict.

876
00:43:30,941 --> 00:43:33,603
Hey, give me.

877
00:43:33,677 --> 00:43:35,611
Here.

878
00:43:35,679 --> 00:43:37,442
What if he really is sorry?

879
00:43:37,514 --> 00:43:39,414
Everyone is sorry once they're caught.
It doesn't mean anything.

880
00:43:39,483 --> 00:43:41,178
It's true.
Rich said he would leave his wife

881
00:43:41,251 --> 00:43:43,310
after I found out he was married.

882
00:43:43,387 --> 00:43:45,014
All's fair in love and war.

883
00:43:45,089 --> 00:43:46,852
Are you retarded?

884
00:43:46,924 --> 00:43:49,722
That's just a bullshit excuse
people use to screw whoever they want.

885
00:43:49,793 --> 00:43:51,488
They need Guantanamo Bay
for relationships.

886
00:43:51,562 --> 00:43:54,030
I'd waterboard the fuck
out of my ex in Love Gitmo.

887
00:43:54,098 --> 00:43:55,463
Good for you.
This is for work.

888
00:43:55,532 --> 00:43:58,262
Hey, you know what?
Tommy just hired a new guy on his desk.

889
00:43:58,369 --> 00:44:01,031
Really? Is he cute?

890
00:44:01,071 --> 00:44:04,700
He didn't say,
which actually probably means he's cute.

891
00:44:04,775 --> 00:44:06,436
I'll find a way to bring him around.

892
00:44:06,510 --> 00:44:07,977
Put this on.

893
00:44:08,045 --> 00:44:10,605
Do I really have to
go out with you guys?

894
00:44:10,681 --> 00:44:12,649
Yes.

895
00:44:12,716 --> 00:44:15,048
Whose bachelorette party
is this, anyway?

896
00:44:16,954 --> 00:44:22,483
Look, I just felt that if we had met
under different circumstances,

897
00:44:22,559 --> 00:44:26,120
just a few weeks ago,
that this could have been something,

898
00:44:26,196 --> 00:44:29,461
like, really amazing.

899
00:44:29,533 --> 00:44:31,194
- I mean...
- I know.

900
00:44:31,268 --> 00:44:34,203
It's crazy, isn't it?

901
00:44:34,271 --> 00:44:35,499
- Yeah.
- Oh.

902
00:44:38,742 --> 00:44:40,573
Can you get my bag?
Thank you.

903
00:44:40,644 --> 00:44:42,509
I love you guys.

904
00:44:42,579 --> 00:44:43,944
I love you.

905
00:44:46,684 --> 00:44:48,174
Thank you.

906
00:44:48,252 --> 00:44:52,416
That could have been
Bad News Bears.

907
00:44:57,394 --> 00:45:00,591
Here's where things started
to get complicated.

908
00:45:00,698 --> 00:45:03,098
Brooke lost her purse
that night at the bar.

909
00:45:03,133 --> 00:45:06,660
Her phone, her keys, everything.

910
00:45:06,737 --> 00:45:08,705
She asked if she could crash on my couch

911
00:45:08,772 --> 00:45:10,501
and call a locksmith in the morning.

912
00:45:12,042 --> 00:45:15,136
I know I really could have
just put my foot down,

913
00:45:15,212 --> 00:45:19,512
but I didn't.

914
00:45:19,583 --> 00:45:20,845
I'm gonna get going.

915
00:45:20,918 --> 00:45:22,112
Okay.

916
00:45:24,922 --> 00:45:25,946
Thanks.

917
00:45:27,091 --> 00:45:28,683
No sweat.

918
00:45:28,759 --> 00:45:30,522
I've always believed that trust

919
00:45:30,594 --> 00:45:32,892
is the single most important thing
in a relationship.

920
00:45:32,963 --> 00:45:35,932
But given that nothing happened,

921
00:45:35,999 --> 00:45:38,194
I decided not to tell Beth.

922
00:45:42,039 --> 00:45:43,904
Hey, hotshot.

923
00:45:43,974 --> 00:45:45,441
Cash, good to see you.

924
00:45:45,509 --> 00:45:47,477
Hello, Beth.
My, you're more lovely than I remember.

925
00:45:47,544 --> 00:45:49,171
Oh, aren't you a sweet talker.

926
00:45:49,246 --> 00:45:52,704
Look at that.
That necklace is gorgeous.

927
00:45:52,783 --> 00:45:55,411
- Look at that thing.
- It was a gift, actually.

928
00:45:55,486 --> 00:45:58,114
- Was it? You picked that out?
- Yes, I did.

929
00:45:58,222 --> 00:46:00,087
- I'm shocked.
- Just a little something.

930
00:46:00,124 --> 00:46:02,354
Oh, you haven't met Beth yet,
have you?

931
00:46:02,426 --> 00:46:03,916
Not officially.

932
00:46:03,994 --> 00:46:05,325
I'm surprised at your taste.

933
00:46:05,395 --> 00:46:08,523
- She's really nice.
- Yeah.

934
00:46:08,599 --> 00:46:09,861
I'm sure.

935
00:46:12,102 --> 00:46:14,764
Okay, who takes the same
bus to work every day?

936
00:46:14,838 --> 00:46:16,499
No, what are you talking about, man?

937
00:46:16,573 --> 00:46:18,507
Stephen's wife is beautiful.

938
00:46:18,575 --> 00:46:20,839
All I'm saying is he passed up
20 good years

939
00:46:20,911 --> 00:46:22,640
of man-whoring.

940
00:46:22,713 --> 00:46:23,873
He could have put up
Wilt Chamberlain numbers

941
00:46:23,947 --> 00:46:24,936
and then retired.

942
00:46:25,015 --> 00:46:26,539
Yeah, he looks miserable.

943
00:46:27,584 --> 00:46:29,643
Anyone need a drink?

944
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:31,654
- So, you came here with Tommy?
- Yeah.

945
00:46:31,722 --> 00:46:33,155
So, how long have you guys been dating?

946
00:46:33,223 --> 00:46:35,691
It's been three months now.

947
00:46:35,759 --> 00:46:38,853
That long?
Oh, I didn't realize that.

948
00:46:38,929 --> 00:46:41,124
Time flies.

949
00:46:41,198 --> 00:46:42,756
Diet Coke, please.

950
00:46:42,833 --> 00:46:44,357
Oh, will you excuse me for a second?

951
00:46:44,434 --> 00:46:46,402
Sure.

952
00:46:51,875 --> 00:46:53,001
Thank you.

953
00:46:56,980 --> 00:46:58,311
Hitting the hard stuff, huh?

954
00:47:00,184 --> 00:47:04,917
Yeah. Saving the table dancing
for the holiday party.

955
00:47:04,988 --> 00:47:06,580
You must be Daniel.

956
00:47:06,657 --> 00:47:08,625
It's so funny.
I'm Beth, Tommy's girlfriend.

957
00:47:08,692 --> 00:47:10,023
Yeah, I figured.

958
00:47:10,093 --> 00:47:12,618
Well, it's nice to meet you.

959
00:47:12,696 --> 00:47:14,425
You too.

960
00:47:14,498 --> 00:47:16,591
- Again.
- Again.

961
00:47:20,470 --> 00:47:23,200
You look different.

962
00:47:28,278 --> 00:47:30,838
So, how did you
and Tommy meet again?

963
00:47:30,914 --> 00:47:32,745
I was out one night with my friend Jordan,

964
00:47:32,816 --> 00:47:35,011
and he was obviously on a date.

965
00:47:35,085 --> 00:47:37,053
- That's trouble.
- Yeah.

966
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:39,611
Well, he left, but he came
back in the restaurant

967
00:47:39,690 --> 00:47:41,749
and told me that he wanted
to be talking to me.

968
00:47:41,825 --> 00:47:43,190
And ever since then...

969
00:47:43,260 --> 00:47:45,353
Tommy, he's a great guy.

970
00:47:45,429 --> 00:47:47,397
Yeah, he's great.

971
00:47:47,464 --> 00:47:49,557
Tommy says you're a big reader.

972
00:47:49,633 --> 00:47:50,622
What's your favorite book?

973
00:47:52,436 --> 00:47:54,495
<i>Well, have you ever read
Pride and Prejudice?</i>

974
00:47:54,571 --> 00:47:57,506
- Really?
- See, you're laughing.

975
00:47:57,608 --> 00:48:00,372
No. It's just why do guys
always pick that book?

976
00:48:00,410 --> 00:48:01,877
I mean, is it in a manual somewhere

977
00:48:01,945 --> 00:48:03,606
on how to speak to women or...

978
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:05,739
No. I like it because

979
00:48:05,816 --> 00:48:08,011
it shows how wrong
first impressions can be.

980
00:48:08,085 --> 00:48:09,450
You know?

981
00:48:09,519 --> 00:48:13,046
And also, the main character,
Elizabeth Bennett...

982
00:48:13,123 --> 00:48:14,954
Sounds stupid, but she's,
like, my ideal woman.

983
00:48:15,025 --> 00:48:17,118
<i>Have you ever read Lolita?</i>

984
00:48:18,662 --> 00:48:20,254
"Lolita, my sin, my soul,

985
00:48:20,330 --> 00:48:22,924
standing four feet ten in one sock."

986
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,400
Hey, you should come to my book club
on Tuesday night.

987
00:48:25,469 --> 00:48:28,870
I think it would be really great
to have a guy for this one.

988
00:48:28,939 --> 00:48:30,201
What about Tommy?

989
00:48:30,274 --> 00:48:32,299
Oh, Tommy would never come.

990
00:48:32,376 --> 00:48:34,310
Plus, there's kind of a no-boyfriend rule.

991
00:48:34,378 --> 00:48:35,936
Yeah.

992
00:48:36,013 --> 00:48:37,002
Sounds like fun.

993
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:38,570
I'm gonna have to
politely decline, though.

994
00:48:38,649 --> 00:48:39,638
Oh, come on.

995
00:48:39,716 --> 00:48:42,742
Just you and five cute girls
and a lot of wine.

996
00:48:42,819 --> 00:48:43,979
- Tommy.
- Hey.

997
00:48:44,054 --> 00:48:45,487
See you saved me
the trouble of introductions.

998
00:48:45,555 --> 00:48:46,681
Yeah, good timing.

999
00:48:46,757 --> 00:48:48,816
You have to convince Daniel
to come to my book club.

1000
00:48:48,892 --> 00:48:50,655
- Book club.
- Yeah.

1001
00:48:50,727 --> 00:48:51,955
That sounds like a great idea.

1002
00:48:52,029 --> 00:48:54,054
Really? Why?

1003
00:48:54,131 --> 00:48:55,826
First of all, you would be talking
to actual women,

1004
00:48:55,899 --> 00:48:56,957
even if it is about books.

1005
00:48:57,034 --> 00:48:59,662
Well, come on. I'm sure
he does just fine with the ladies.

1006
00:48:59,770 --> 00:49:02,466
- Don't you?
- Not really, no.

1007
00:49:02,506 --> 00:49:04,940
And secondly, it would give
me endless opportunities to fuck with you.

1008
00:49:05,008 --> 00:49:06,999
That's why I don't think
it's a really good idea.

1009
00:49:11,982 --> 00:49:13,006
Good morning, soldier.

1010
00:49:14,351 --> 00:49:16,182
Morning.

1011
00:49:16,253 --> 00:49:18,414
What are you reading?

1012
00:49:18,488 --> 00:49:20,319
Oh, just a book.

1013
00:49:22,225 --> 00:49:23,920
What book?

1014
00:49:23,994 --> 00:49:25,655
- It's nothing.
- What book?

1015
00:49:25,729 --> 00:49:27,560
What is the t...

1016
00:49:27,631 --> 00:49:28,757
<i>Pride and Prejudice.</i>

1017
00:49:28,832 --> 00:49:30,697
Put that away. Jesus.

1018
00:49:30,767 --> 00:49:32,997
What are you,
carpooling with Oprah?

1019
00:49:37,140 --> 00:49:38,505
Met a woman...

1020
00:49:39,876 --> 00:49:42,037
She reminds me
of the character in the book.

1021
00:49:44,247 --> 00:49:48,377
You're doing really lovely
with those language tapes, Jan.

1022
00:49:50,587 --> 00:49:51,645
So when you say cute,

1023
00:49:51,722 --> 00:49:52,689
do you mean, like,

1024
00:49:52,756 --> 00:49:54,189
little kid with gum in his hair cute

1025
00:49:54,257 --> 00:49:56,782
- or Brad Pitt cute?
- Somewhere in-between.

1026
00:49:56,860 --> 00:49:59,761
<i>See, I don't want this turning into some
lame episode of The Bachelor.</i>

1027
00:49:59,830 --> 00:50:02,025
Hey, I thought women were supposed
to love men in uniform.

1028
00:50:02,099 --> 00:50:04,260
Yeah, government salaries
and post-traumatic stress

1029
00:50:04,334 --> 00:50:05,528
really do it to me nasty.

1030
00:50:05,602 --> 00:50:08,196
And we've met Tommy's work friends.

1031
00:50:08,271 --> 00:50:09,533
No, but he's nothing like those guys.

1032
00:50:09,606 --> 00:50:11,733
If anything, he's too old-fashioned.

1033
00:50:11,808 --> 00:50:14,299
What, he still prefers vaginal sex?

1034
00:50:14,378 --> 00:50:15,902
Ooh, old school, yeah.

1035
00:50:17,381 --> 00:50:18,348
You said you invited him later.

1036
00:50:18,415 --> 00:50:19,541
I did.

1037
00:50:19,616 --> 00:50:21,379
Oh, I need my...

1038
00:50:21,451 --> 00:50:23,715
- Okay, come on, girl.
- Just think about this as a tryout.

1039
00:50:23,787 --> 00:50:25,311
You guys are pathetic.

1040
00:50:25,389 --> 00:50:27,254
- You look cute. You're adorable.
- Thank you.

1041
00:50:27,324 --> 00:50:28,723
Hello.

1042
00:50:28,792 --> 00:50:29,781
It's Daniel.

1043
00:50:29,860 --> 00:50:31,691
He's polite and early.

1044
00:50:31,762 --> 00:50:34,162
- Yeah, he's gay.
- He's not gay.

1045
00:50:34,231 --> 00:50:35,721
- He was in the military.
- Gay.

1046
00:50:35,799 --> 00:50:36,857
Yeah, don't ask, don't tell.

1047
00:50:38,802 --> 00:50:39,962
- Hey.
- Hi.

1048
00:50:40,037 --> 00:50:41,436
Come on in.

1049
00:50:41,505 --> 00:50:43,996
I got you this.

1050
00:50:44,074 --> 00:50:46,235
- Oh, thank you.
- It's wine.

1051
00:50:46,309 --> 00:50:49,244
Yeah. So, you have
to meet everybody.

1052
00:50:49,312 --> 00:50:53,578
Daniel, this is Lisa,
Jordan, Susan, and Jill.

1053
00:50:53,650 --> 00:50:54,742
Hi, everyone.

1054
00:50:54,818 --> 00:50:55,978
Hi.

1055
00:50:56,053 --> 00:50:57,486
Sorry I'm so early.

1056
00:50:59,189 --> 00:51:01,282
No, no.
We were just having some girl talk.

1057
00:51:01,358 --> 00:51:03,053
- Just sat down.
- Well, I can just come back

1058
00:51:03,126 --> 00:51:05,117
- if you guys are...
- No, please.

1059
00:51:05,195 --> 00:51:07,163
- Sit.
- Yeah, come on.

1060
00:51:10,333 --> 00:51:13,029
And apparently, they've
never seen a man before.

1061
00:51:13,103 --> 00:51:15,298
Ever.

1062
00:51:16,373 --> 00:51:18,273
I know it's a classic,
but I can't get past

1063
00:51:18,341 --> 00:51:19,774
this old, Euro-trash pervert

1064
00:51:19,843 --> 00:51:21,003
screwing a 12-year-old
from New Hampshire.

1065
00:51:21,078 --> 00:51:23,376
- It's disgusting.
- And the way he bribes her for sex

1066
00:51:23,447 --> 00:51:25,381
with candy
and pocket change?

1067
00:51:25,449 --> 00:51:27,383
Daniel, you've been awfully quiet.

1068
00:51:27,451 --> 00:51:29,476
Have we scared you out of talking?

1069
00:51:29,553 --> 00:51:33,455
Well, I can't disagree
with what's been said so far.

1070
00:51:33,523 --> 00:51:36,754
Obviously, yeah,
the guy is really troubled.

1071
00:51:36,827 --> 00:51:38,385
- And he's...
- Pervert. Pedophile.

1072
00:51:38,462 --> 00:51:39,759
Let him finish.

1073
00:51:39,830 --> 00:51:45,462
Yes. But I believe that
he was hopelessly in love.

1074
00:51:45,535 --> 00:51:46,627
You know, doesn't make it okay,

1075
00:51:46,703 --> 00:51:49,501
but he's not just a pervert.

1076
00:51:49,573 --> 00:51:51,939
- Yeah. He's a murderer too.
- Okay, all right.

1077
00:51:52,008 --> 00:51:54,272
Years later, he kills the man
that stole his Lolita.

1078
00:51:54,344 --> 00:51:57,370
But he loved her more than anything.

1079
00:51:57,447 --> 00:51:59,278
Even his own life.

1080
00:52:00,517 --> 00:52:02,644
I think that's what love is.

1081
00:52:02,719 --> 00:52:04,653
Anything else is just...

1082
00:52:04,721 --> 00:52:06,848
a distraction.

1083
00:52:11,895 --> 00:52:13,760
Should we choose another book?

1084
00:52:13,830 --> 00:52:15,229
- For next time?
- Yeah.

1085
00:52:15,298 --> 00:52:16,993
Will you be able to join us next time?

1086
00:52:17,067 --> 00:52:19,194
Uh, okay,

1087
00:52:19,269 --> 00:52:22,705
but I kind of got the feeling
tonight was sort of a tryout.

1088
00:52:22,772 --> 00:52:24,034
Oh, no.

1089
00:52:24,107 --> 00:52:25,131
- No.
- No.

1090
00:52:25,208 --> 00:52:27,540
- You passed.
- Yeah, sure.

1091
00:52:27,611 --> 00:52:30,842
You guys can be like
the sisters I never wanted.

1092
00:52:32,115 --> 00:52:33,707
- Thanks. Lovely.
- Nice.

1093
00:52:33,783 --> 00:52:36,217
<i>All right. Well then, is everybody okay
with The Good Soldier?</i>

1094
00:52:36,286 --> 00:52:38,447
No. I don't really want
to read a war novel.

1095
00:52:38,522 --> 00:52:40,319
Oh, no, but it's
a love story, isn't it?

1096
00:52:40,390 --> 00:52:42,358
Well, here.

1097
00:52:42,425 --> 00:52:44,655
"This heartbreaking novel
of infidelity and betrayal

1098
00:52:44,728 --> 00:52:46,753
"tells the story of an ex-soldier

1099
00:52:46,830 --> 00:52:48,491
"and seemingly perfect gentleman.

1100
00:52:48,565 --> 00:52:51,227
"'He was just the sort of man
you could trust your wife with,'

1101
00:52:51,301 --> 00:52:54,862
says the tragic narrator of the story."

1102
00:52:55,805 --> 00:52:57,602
- There you go.
- Thanks.

1103
00:52:59,109 --> 00:53:02,442
Actually...

1104
00:53:02,512 --> 00:53:05,640
You're a total neat freak, aren't you?

1105
00:53:05,715 --> 00:53:08,980
Actually, my apartment's a mess.

1106
00:53:09,052 --> 00:53:12,021
Therapy for all those years of me
spit-shining my shoes.

1107
00:53:12,088 --> 00:53:14,249
I cannot picture you in the military.

1108
00:53:14,324 --> 00:53:15,552
What does that mean?

1109
00:53:15,625 --> 00:53:16,751
I don't know.

1110
00:53:16,826 --> 00:53:20,785
You just don't seem very aggressive.

1111
00:53:20,864 --> 00:53:22,593
Are you kidding me?

1112
00:53:22,666 --> 00:53:24,725
I was an avionics engineer.

1113
00:53:24,801 --> 00:53:27,167
- Were you?
- Yeah.

1114
00:53:27,237 --> 00:53:28,226
Super-aggressive.

1115
00:53:29,606 --> 00:53:32,598
No. My dad, he was in the Air Force,

1116
00:53:32,676 --> 00:53:36,009
and the only way I could
afford Princeton was ROTC.

1117
00:53:36,079 --> 00:53:39,310
Get up every morning at 6 A. M.,

1118
00:53:39,382 --> 00:53:43,079
do some push ups,
they pay for school.

1119
00:53:43,153 --> 00:53:44,984
But you didn't finish your service, right?

1120
00:53:45,055 --> 00:53:46,522
Tommy said you dropped out.

1121
00:53:48,225 --> 00:53:49,419
I didn't mean it like that.

1122
00:53:49,492 --> 00:53:51,221
No, it's okay. I...

1123
00:53:53,863 --> 00:53:56,730
You have to serve
four years after college

1124
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:58,131
in order to get your loans paid off,

1125
00:53:58,235 --> 00:54:01,636
and my commanding officer
served with my dad,

1126
00:54:01,671 --> 00:54:04,504
and after three years,
I had some...

1127
00:54:04,574 --> 00:54:06,542
I just had some stuff that happened.

1128
00:54:06,610 --> 00:54:09,511
And he agreed to get me discharged a year
early.

1129
00:54:09,579 --> 00:54:11,945
That's good.

1130
00:54:12,015 --> 00:54:12,982
- I think.
- No.

1131
00:54:13,049 --> 00:54:14,676
No, it was at the time.

1132
00:54:14,751 --> 00:54:18,448
But now I've got a hundred grand
in student loans to pay off.

1133
00:54:18,521 --> 00:54:21,456
- God.
- Lot of push ups for nothing.

1134
00:54:21,524 --> 00:54:24,960
Well, I wouldn't say nothing.

1135
00:54:29,332 --> 00:54:32,233
That would be Tommy.

1136
00:54:34,671 --> 00:54:35,933
Hey, come on up.

1137
00:54:39,476 --> 00:54:41,467
Guess I should get going, huh?

1138
00:54:41,544 --> 00:54:44,672
Okay. Well, I'm so glad
you could make it.

1139
00:54:44,748 --> 00:54:47,012
And thank you
for offering to clean up.

1140
00:54:47,083 --> 00:54:49,449
- It was nice.
- Yeah.

1141
00:54:49,519 --> 00:54:51,419
Hey, guys.

1142
00:54:51,488 --> 00:54:53,183
How was book club?

1143
00:54:55,225 --> 00:54:56,453
It was good.

1144
00:55:05,135 --> 00:55:08,798
Are you ever actually
gonna want to leave this city?

1145
00:55:08,872 --> 00:55:11,340
Someday, yeah.

1146
00:55:11,408 --> 00:55:12,807
Come on, babe, it's late.

1147
00:55:20,283 --> 00:55:24,777
My aunt and uncle used to be
these big-shot lawyers.

1148
00:55:26,389 --> 00:55:29,790
Working hundred-hour weeks
and never getting to see each other.

1149
00:55:29,859 --> 00:55:32,293
One day, they just moved to Colorado

1150
00:55:32,362 --> 00:55:34,796
to run this hot air balloon company.

1151
00:55:34,864 --> 00:55:37,389
That's great.
Good for them.

1152
00:55:37,467 --> 00:55:39,867
It is.

1153
00:55:39,936 --> 00:55:41,904
They take people up to watch the sunset

1154
00:55:41,971 --> 00:55:44,132
over the Rockies every night.

1155
00:55:44,207 --> 00:55:45,572
They get by okay,

1156
00:55:45,642 --> 00:55:49,908
and they get to see
each other every day.

1157
00:55:49,979 --> 00:55:52,709
And he hasn't thrown her
out of the basket yet?

1158
00:55:55,518 --> 00:55:58,351
Come on, babe.
Let's go to sleep.

1159
00:56:14,037 --> 00:56:17,063
I was offered a promotion
in San Francisco.

1160
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:27,013
And can you make sure
they arrive this afternoon?

1161
00:56:27,083 --> 00:56:28,675
They need to be there
when he gets home.

1162
00:56:28,752 --> 00:56:30,481
As long as there's a doorman, sure.

1163
00:56:30,553 --> 00:56:31,952
Did you want to fill out a card?

1164
00:56:32,021 --> 00:56:33,716
Yes.

1165
00:56:45,668 --> 00:56:47,226
You like flowers.
Why don't you just keep them?

1166
00:56:47,303 --> 00:56:48,634
This isn't funny.

1167
00:56:48,705 --> 00:56:50,969
"Happy Anniversary"?
This has to stop.

1168
00:56:52,776 --> 00:56:56,007
I guess I did meet her
about this time last year.

1169
00:56:56,079 --> 00:56:57,512
Beth, Beth,

1170
00:56:57,614 --> 00:56:59,479
you're mad at me,
and that's exactly what Christie wants.

1171
00:56:59,516 --> 00:57:01,143
This has nothing to do with us.

1172
00:57:01,217 --> 00:57:02,309
Of course it does.

1173
00:57:02,385 --> 00:57:04,649
"We all have a past."
Remember?

1174
00:57:04,721 --> 00:57:06,746
I dealt with mine.
You are not dealing with yours.

1175
00:57:06,823 --> 00:57:08,347
What else do you want me to do?

1176
00:57:08,425 --> 00:57:10,655
I can get a restraining order.

1177
00:57:10,727 --> 00:57:12,752
How does one actually do that?

1178
00:57:12,829 --> 00:57:14,592
I'm tired of this.
Honestly.

1179
00:57:33,950 --> 00:57:34,974
Hello.

1180
00:57:35,051 --> 00:57:36,109
Hi.

1181
00:57:36,186 --> 00:57:37,949
What's for dinner?

1182
00:57:39,656 --> 00:57:42,216
Just peanut butter...

1183
00:57:42,292 --> 00:57:44,123
sandwiches.

1184
00:57:44,194 --> 00:57:45,684
All right.

1185
00:57:45,762 --> 00:57:47,957
Hey, Tommy and Lisa and I

1186
00:57:48,031 --> 00:57:49,123
are going for dinner next week

1187
00:57:49,199 --> 00:57:50,393
and we wanted to invite you along.

1188
00:57:50,467 --> 00:57:51,491
I can't.

1189
00:57:51,568 --> 00:57:53,934
I didn't even say which night yet.

1190
00:57:54,003 --> 00:57:57,336
Uh, no. I just, um...

1191
00:57:57,407 --> 00:57:58,931
I don't like to be set up.

1192
00:57:59,008 --> 00:58:01,442
Oh. Well, it's not a setup.

1193
00:58:01,511 --> 00:58:03,308
How's Monday night?

1194
00:58:03,379 --> 00:58:05,210
We're going for sushi.
It's better than peanut butter.

1195
00:58:05,281 --> 00:58:06,612
Yeah, uh...

1196
00:58:06,683 --> 00:58:08,412
I think I could do Monday.

1197
00:58:08,485 --> 00:58:09,543
- Okay.
- Sure.

1198
00:58:09,619 --> 00:58:11,849
- Good.
- Huh.

1199
00:58:11,921 --> 00:58:14,048
What are you doing home
on a Friday night anyway?

1200
00:58:14,123 --> 00:58:16,318
Oh, it's just been
kind of a long week.

1201
00:58:16,392 --> 00:58:17,620
What's your excuse?

1202
00:58:17,694 --> 00:58:19,855
I'm meeting Tommy later.

1203
00:58:21,264 --> 00:58:22,253
So, what's your story?

1204
00:58:22,332 --> 00:58:23,731
Why don't you have a girlfriend?

1205
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:27,759
Well, my ex-girlfriend,

1206
00:58:27,837 --> 00:58:31,671
uh, fiance, she got pregnant
while I was serving overseas.

1207
00:58:31,741 --> 00:58:33,174
She visited you over there?

1208
00:58:33,243 --> 00:58:34,232
No.

1209
00:58:34,310 --> 00:58:36,244
No, that was kind of the problem.

1210
00:58:37,413 --> 00:58:39,506
Oh. Sorry.

1211
00:58:39,582 --> 00:58:41,174
Well, it's not really the homecoming

1212
00:58:41,651 --> 00:58:43,881
I'd been looking forward to
for three years, you know?

1213
00:58:43,953 --> 00:58:44,977
Right.

1214
00:58:46,122 --> 00:58:48,682
So, are you interested
in anyone these days?

1215
00:58:50,393 --> 00:58:54,193
Interested like, um...

1216
00:58:54,264 --> 00:58:55,253
No, no, not...

1217
00:58:55,331 --> 00:58:56,889
That's a yes.

1218
00:58:56,966 --> 00:58:58,365
Who is she?
Do I know her?

1219
00:59:00,970 --> 00:59:03,268
I don't think you do, Beth.

1220
00:59:13,449 --> 00:59:15,781
All right, say when.

1221
00:59:15,852 --> 00:59:17,683
It's a school night.

1222
00:59:17,754 --> 00:59:19,381
You know?

1223
00:59:19,455 --> 00:59:21,787
It's okay, I don't have to be
at work until late tomorrow.

1224
00:59:23,459 --> 00:59:25,791
So, what was your favorite
country that you visited?

1225
00:59:26,863 --> 00:59:27,887
Oh, I don't know.

1226
00:59:27,964 --> 00:59:30,296
Botswana, maybe.

1227
00:59:30,366 --> 00:59:31,458
No, Vietnam.

1228
00:59:31,534 --> 00:59:34,594
People there are so nice.

1229
00:59:34,671 --> 00:59:36,935
Beaches are just amazing,

1230
00:59:37,006 --> 00:59:39,941
and it's like a million
dong to the dollar,

1231
00:59:40,009 --> 00:59:41,442
so it's really cheap.

1232
00:59:41,511 --> 00:59:43,206
A million dongs to a dollar, huh?

1233
00:59:43,279 --> 00:59:44,769
Sounds like a good time.

1234
00:59:49,152 --> 00:59:51,052
So, what was Botswana like?

1235
00:59:51,120 --> 00:59:53,054
Okay.

1236
00:59:53,122 --> 00:59:56,091
Picture herds of zebra and elephant,

1237
00:59:56,159 --> 00:59:58,218
literally just stopping traffic on highways.

1238
00:59:58,294 --> 01:00:01,161
And the currency there

1239
01:00:01,230 --> 01:00:03,255
actually, it's called the pula,

1240
01:00:03,333 --> 01:00:05,961
which is the same word as rain.

1241
01:00:06,035 --> 01:00:07,059
Oh, 'cause of the droughts.

1242
01:00:07,136 --> 01:00:08,398
Yeah, exactly.

1243
01:00:08,471 --> 01:00:10,996
And the pennies,
they're called raindrops.

1244
01:00:11,074 --> 01:00:12,974
So poetic.

1245
01:00:13,042 --> 01:00:14,441
It is.

1246
01:00:14,510 --> 01:00:15,636
Aren't you drinking?

1247
01:00:15,712 --> 01:00:18,943
- Oh, yeah.
- Never pour your own sake.

1248
01:00:19,015 --> 01:00:22,712
Seven years bad sex.
That's a fact.

1249
01:00:22,785 --> 01:00:23,843
Seven more years, huh?

1250
01:00:27,290 --> 01:00:28,450
School night.

1251
01:00:29,859 --> 01:00:32,157
Oops.

1252
01:00:35,665 --> 01:00:37,189
Let's have a toast.

1253
01:00:38,368 --> 01:00:40,598
To Daniel's success in his new job.

1254
01:00:40,670 --> 01:00:43,468
And to Lisa's promotion.

1255
01:00:43,539 --> 01:00:45,473
And to Beth, for organizing tonight.

1256
01:00:45,541 --> 01:00:48,009
Yes, here's to everyone.
Except me.

1257
01:00:53,182 --> 01:00:55,912
Beth, what are you going to do
about that job offer in California?

1258
01:00:55,985 --> 01:00:58,283
Well, it's such a great opportunity,

1259
01:00:58,388 --> 01:01:01,186
but part of me feels
like I shouldn't go.

1260
01:01:01,224 --> 01:01:03,283
When would you be moving?

1261
01:01:03,359 --> 01:01:05,827
Probably in about a month.

1262
01:01:05,895 --> 01:01:07,192
Yeah. I'd miss her like crazy,

1263
01:01:07,263 --> 01:01:09,663
but it's only a plane ride, right?

1264
01:01:09,732 --> 01:01:11,393
Yeah. I mean, it's not that far.

1265
01:01:11,467 --> 01:01:13,367
I just can't make up my mind.

1266
01:01:14,570 --> 01:01:16,197
I know how you can figure it out.

1267
01:01:18,207 --> 01:01:20,072
This...

1268
01:01:20,143 --> 01:01:22,543
can show you exactly
what you want, deep down.

1269
01:01:22,612 --> 01:01:25,206
Yeah, let's leave all of life's
major decisions to a coin toss.

1270
01:01:25,281 --> 01:01:26,942
That's brilliant, Daniel.

1271
01:01:27,016 --> 01:01:28,415
I don't really believe in luck.

1272
01:01:28,484 --> 01:01:29,508
No, it's not about luck.

1273
01:01:29,585 --> 01:01:30,574
Okay?

1274
01:01:30,653 --> 01:01:33,144
Heads you stay, tails you go.

1275
01:01:34,424 --> 01:01:35,914
You gotta trust me, though, okay?

1276
01:01:37,560 --> 01:01:40,120
- This is ridiculous.
- Heads you stay, tails you go.

1277
01:01:42,198 --> 01:01:44,826
What do you want it to be?

1278
01:01:49,806 --> 01:01:51,899
Stay.

1279
01:01:53,376 --> 01:01:54,866
Then that's your answer.

1280
01:01:56,813 --> 01:01:58,405
What was it really?

1281
01:01:58,514 --> 01:01:59,674
What was it?

1282
01:01:59,716 --> 01:02:02,549
Doesn't matter.

1283
01:02:02,618 --> 01:02:04,085
Dude, you looked at it.
Come on.

1284
01:02:04,153 --> 01:02:05,916
That's not the point.
She knows what she wants now.

1285
01:02:05,988 --> 01:02:08,081
Yeah, I guess I do.

1286
01:02:18,067 --> 01:02:19,159
Thanks for dinner, Tommy.

1287
01:02:19,235 --> 01:02:21,032
- Yes.
- Yes, very generous, as always.

1288
01:02:21,104 --> 01:02:23,971
- Thank you.
- My pleasure.

1289
01:02:24,040 --> 01:02:26,770
Shit. I left my credit card inside.

1290
01:02:26,843 --> 01:02:29,038
Be right back.

1291
01:02:31,447 --> 01:02:33,472
- I think I'm gonna call it a night.
- Oh, okay.

1292
01:02:33,549 --> 01:02:35,744
Yeah, I was thinking the same thing.

1293
01:02:36,786 --> 01:02:38,048
Do you want to share a cab?

1294
01:02:39,088 --> 01:02:41,682
No.

1295
01:02:41,758 --> 01:02:43,953
I'm headed downtown,
you're headed Upper West, right?

1296
01:02:44,026 --> 01:02:45,288
Yeah.

1297
01:02:45,361 --> 01:02:46,828
Wouldn't make sense, you know?

1298
01:02:46,896 --> 01:02:48,796
Logistically.

1299
01:02:48,865 --> 01:02:51,493
Got it. What's the plan?

1300
01:02:51,567 --> 01:02:53,057
I'm just gonna call it a night.

1301
01:02:53,136 --> 01:02:54,763
- Thanks for everything, man.
- Really?

1302
01:02:54,837 --> 01:02:55,963
Yeah, I'll see you tomorrow.

1303
01:02:56,038 --> 01:02:57,528
You guys have a good night, all right?

1304
01:02:57,640 --> 01:02:58,664
- You too.
- Yeah, right. Good night.

1305
01:02:58,708 --> 01:03:00,539
Take care.

1306
01:03:07,350 --> 01:03:09,910
What's the 10-spot, 45?

1307
01:03:09,986 --> 01:03:11,510
I'm not trying to bend you over, okay?

1308
01:03:11,587 --> 01:03:13,282
Just grow a pair of nuts and lift me.

1309
01:03:13,356 --> 01:03:14,789
I still need a better bid from Northrup.

1310
01:03:14,857 --> 01:03:15,789
Daniel, you're up on Cyberon.

1311
01:03:15,858 --> 01:03:17,018
All right, take a report.

1312
01:03:17,093 --> 01:03:20,187
Hundred thou?
A nickel better than your order.

1313
01:03:20,263 --> 01:03:22,390
Yeah. Okay, thanks.

1314
01:03:22,465 --> 01:03:23,989
Jack, stick with me on this one.

1315
01:03:24,066 --> 01:03:25,931
- Did you hear me?
- Get him to fucking hit me.

1316
01:03:33,109 --> 01:03:34,770
All right, Jack,
we just got another seller.

1317
01:03:34,844 --> 01:03:37,438
It's fill or kill.
What do you want to do?

1318
01:03:40,383 --> 01:03:43,477
Great. I'll have Jen
call you with the report.

1319
01:03:43,553 --> 01:03:45,020
Have fun in the Hamptons.

1320
01:03:45,087 --> 01:03:46,884
Yep.

1321
01:03:46,956 --> 01:03:48,048
Done your way, Shakespeare.

1322
01:03:48,124 --> 01:03:49,614
Thank you, Danimal.

1323
01:03:49,692 --> 01:03:50,624
Jen.

1324
01:03:50,693 --> 01:03:52,320
I'm all over it, Danimal.

1325
01:04:04,640 --> 01:04:06,574
You know, it's kind of sad
if you think about it.

1326
01:04:06,642 --> 01:04:08,041
Those guys spend all their time

1327
01:04:08,110 --> 01:04:12,570
looking for something
they're never gonna find.

1328
01:04:12,648 --> 01:04:14,582
What? The perfect woman?

1329
01:04:14,650 --> 01:04:17,585
Yeah, there's no such thing.

1330
01:04:19,088 --> 01:04:20,885
So you've never been tempted, huh?

1331
01:04:23,392 --> 01:04:26,054
Well, I mean, of course
I've been tempted.

1332
01:04:26,128 --> 01:04:29,188
Why? Does that surprise you?

1333
01:04:29,265 --> 01:04:30,926
I can go home at night,

1334
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:32,297
I can look at my wife

1335
01:04:32,368 --> 01:04:34,734
and my kids in the eye,

1336
01:04:34,804 --> 01:04:36,863
not feel like a total fraud.

1337
01:04:38,608 --> 01:04:40,701
I mean, to me,
that's a good trade.

1338
01:04:59,662 --> 01:05:01,857
Daniel. How's it going?

1339
01:05:05,368 --> 01:05:06,995
Good to see you, man.

1340
01:05:07,069 --> 01:05:08,593
Hi, Daniel.
I'm Christie.

1341
01:05:08,671 --> 01:05:10,070
I've heard a lot about you.

1342
01:05:10,139 --> 01:05:11,663
Yeah, you too.

1343
01:05:11,741 --> 01:05:13,834
Yeah. So, Daniel and I have a meeting

1344
01:05:13,910 --> 01:05:14,842
we gotta get up to.

1345
01:05:14,911 --> 01:05:16,606
So I'll see you later.

1346
01:05:16,679 --> 01:05:19,079
Okay. Bye.

1347
01:05:24,954 --> 01:05:26,353
Sorry about that.
She's a little nuts

1348
01:05:26,422 --> 01:05:28,049
and I had to stop her
from coming upstairs.

1349
01:05:28,124 --> 01:05:30,422
- It's okay. It's fine.
- But you show up in the nick of time.

1350
01:05:30,493 --> 01:05:31,960
It's good.
This is good.

1351
01:05:32,028 --> 01:05:34,462
And I know you and Beth
are becoming real good friends.

1352
01:05:34,530 --> 01:05:35,656
I think that's cool and everything.

1353
01:05:35,731 --> 01:05:38,666
This is probably something
she doesn't need to hear about,

1354
01:05:38,734 --> 01:05:42,568
unless you're trying to split us up

1355
01:05:42,638 --> 01:05:45,698
for some reason.

1356
01:05:47,209 --> 01:05:49,609
Fucking with you.

1357
01:05:49,679 --> 01:05:51,374
- You all right?
- Yeah.

1358
01:06:05,928 --> 01:06:08,123
Hi, it's Tommy.
Leave a message.

1359
01:07:10,659 --> 01:07:12,217
Hey, Beth.

1360
01:07:12,294 --> 01:07:14,455
Hey. Where are you?

1361
01:07:14,530 --> 01:07:16,327
I'm at home.

1362
01:07:16,399 --> 01:07:18,560
Tommy said you guys had
an important dinner tonight.

1363
01:07:18,634 --> 01:07:22,195
well, I guess
I'm not that important.

1364
01:07:23,939 --> 01:07:26,874
- Did you finish the book yet?
- Yeah.

1365
01:07:26,942 --> 01:07:28,375
I just did.

1366
01:07:28,444 --> 01:07:30,912
I'm not sure how
I feel about it, though.

1367
01:07:30,980 --> 01:07:33,107
What do you mean?

1368
01:07:33,182 --> 01:07:37,846
Well, you kind of
just trust the narrator

1369
01:07:37,920 --> 01:07:39,547
out of habit, you know?

1370
01:07:39,622 --> 01:07:41,920
But just as you're getting into it,

1371
01:07:41,991 --> 01:07:44,050
he just turns out to be full of shit.

1372
01:07:44,126 --> 01:07:46,094
Yeah, so?

1373
01:07:46,162 --> 01:07:48,255
What's the point of that?

1374
01:07:51,567 --> 01:07:52,898
Maybe it's just like real life.

1375
01:07:54,570 --> 01:07:59,030
Sometimes, people just aren't
who you thought they were.

1376
01:08:02,011 --> 01:08:04,536
You'd tell me if...

1377
01:08:04,613 --> 01:08:06,808
if something were going on
with Tommy, right?

1378
01:08:08,451 --> 01:08:10,612
Yeah, if I knew anything.

1379
01:08:10,686 --> 01:08:14,053
I mean, there's no stupid guy code
or anything, is there?

1380
01:08:15,991 --> 01:08:17,515
Don't say anything
to Tommy, okay?

1381
01:08:17,593 --> 01:08:18,924
No, of course not.

1382
01:08:18,994 --> 01:08:20,427
Thanks.

1383
01:08:20,496 --> 01:08:21,758
Hey, what are you doing tonight?

1384
01:08:21,831 --> 01:08:24,129
Do you want to come get a drink
with me and my friends?

1385
01:08:24,200 --> 01:08:25,792
I can't, Beth.

1386
01:08:27,503 --> 01:08:29,437
I'm kind of expecting someone.

1387
01:08:29,505 --> 01:08:32,099
Oh. Okay.

1388
01:08:32,174 --> 01:08:35,575
Well, have fun tonight.

1389
01:08:35,644 --> 01:08:36,975
Whatever you're doing. And...

1390
01:08:37,046 --> 01:08:40,106
Well, you know, not too much fun.

1391
01:08:40,182 --> 01:08:42,878
Ha-ha.

1392
01:08:42,952 --> 01:08:43,976
I'll talk to you later.

1393
01:08:44,053 --> 01:08:46,681
Okay. Bye.

1394
01:08:50,826 --> 01:08:52,418
Hello.

1395
01:08:52,495 --> 01:08:53,928
Delivery for Mr. Daniel.

1396
01:08:53,996 --> 01:08:55,964
Yep, come on up.

1397
01:08:58,200 --> 01:08:59,997
Doesn't this place have any boys?

1398
01:09:00,069 --> 01:09:02,663
You should call Daniel.
What's up with Daniel tonight?

1399
01:09:02,738 --> 01:09:05,366
I don't know. It's...

1400
01:09:05,441 --> 01:09:08,001
It sounded like he had
some hot date coming over.

1401
01:09:10,012 --> 01:09:11,479
Yeah. Somehow I doubt that.

1402
01:09:11,547 --> 01:09:13,208
Why? What does that mean?

1403
01:09:13,282 --> 01:09:14,874
The guy is totally in love with you.

1404
01:09:14,950 --> 01:09:16,315
Why didn't he come tonight, then?

1405
01:09:16,385 --> 01:09:17,875
You're his boss's girlfriend.

1406
01:09:17,953 --> 01:09:20,114
- I'm sure it kills him to be around you.
- Shut up.

1407
01:09:23,092 --> 01:09:25,458
- Oh, my God.
- What? It's not that surprising.

1408
01:09:25,528 --> 01:09:29,430
No. It's... Over there.
It's Crazy Christie.

1409
01:09:29,498 --> 01:09:30,726
- Tommy's ex?
- Yeah.

1410
01:09:30,799 --> 01:09:32,232
Which one is she?

1411
01:09:32,301 --> 01:09:33,563
She's the little Audrey Hepburn
in the red dress.

1412
01:09:33,636 --> 01:09:35,467
- That's her, isn't it?
- Yeah.

1413
01:09:35,538 --> 01:09:37,165
She's not that pretty.

1414
01:09:37,239 --> 01:09:38,467
You need to talk to her.

1415
01:09:38,541 --> 01:09:39,872
I don't want to make a scene.

1416
01:09:39,942 --> 01:09:42,843
Make a huge fucking scene.
This has gone on long enough.

1417
01:09:44,914 --> 01:09:48,611
You're right.
This has gone on long enough.

1418
01:09:59,128 --> 01:10:00,459
Can I help you?

1419
01:10:01,664 --> 01:10:04,827
We've never met before, but I...

1420
01:10:06,135 --> 01:10:08,069
You used to date Tom Fielding, right?

1421
01:10:09,505 --> 01:10:12,269
Are you one of Tommy's ex-girlfriends?

1422
01:10:13,442 --> 01:10:15,876
Ex-girlfriends? No.

1423
01:10:15,945 --> 01:10:18,243
Tommy and I have been together
for three months now.

1424
01:10:27,656 --> 01:10:30,124
Nice necklace.

1425
01:10:59,855 --> 01:11:01,686
Sorry.

1426
01:11:01,757 --> 01:11:04,055
I ran into an old friend
on line for the bathroom.

1427
01:11:04,126 --> 01:11:06,993
It's okay.
Should we get the check?

1428
01:11:07,062 --> 01:11:10,293
Actually, I think I
want to stay out tonight.

1429
01:11:10,366 --> 01:11:13,563
I mean, we spent the whole day inside.

1430
01:11:13,636 --> 01:11:15,934
Yeah, but wasn't it great?

1431
01:11:16,005 --> 01:11:19,441
Well, all we ever do
is stay in and have sex...

1432
01:11:19,508 --> 01:11:21,135
since the first night we met.

1433
01:11:23,946 --> 01:11:25,436
I want to go out tonight.

1434
01:11:27,082 --> 01:11:29,016
But we are out.

1435
01:11:32,021 --> 01:11:32,988
<i>Ciao, carissima.</i>

1436
01:11:33,055 --> 01:11:35,990
<i>Ciao, Paolo.</i>

1437
01:11:36,058 --> 01:11:37,616
Tommy...

1438
01:11:38,661 --> 01:11:40,754
Paolo, this is Tommy.

1439
01:11:40,829 --> 01:11:42,922
- Ah, Tommy.
- Paolo.

1440
01:11:42,998 --> 01:11:44,932
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you too.

1441
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:46,991
Oh, Paolo, Tommy
speaks Italian too.

1442
01:11:55,744 --> 01:11:57,268
Yeah, it's a little loud in here

1443
01:11:57,346 --> 01:11:59,473
and I'm a little rusty, probably, so...

1444
01:12:00,916 --> 01:12:02,850
We speak English then, hmm?

1445
01:12:02,918 --> 01:12:04,283
Yeah. It's probably better for everyone.

1446
01:12:05,688 --> 01:12:06,746
Sure.

1447
01:12:09,091 --> 01:12:10,490
So, how do you guys
know each other?

1448
01:12:10,559 --> 01:12:12,493
Oh, I... Okay.

1449
01:12:13,962 --> 01:12:16,863
So, one day, Brooke came into my studio

1450
01:12:16,932 --> 01:12:18,661
to make some photos.

1451
01:12:18,734 --> 01:12:20,531
Very nice photos, eh?

1452
01:12:20,602 --> 01:12:22,536
- Paolo is a genius.
- Oh, no.

1453
01:12:22,604 --> 01:12:23,866
- Yes.
- So,

1454
01:12:23,939 --> 01:12:26,703
Tommy, what is it you do?

1455
01:12:26,775 --> 01:12:29,243
I work at a bank...
Morgan Brothers.

1456
01:12:29,311 --> 01:12:31,905
- Sales trading.
- I understand. Wall Street.

1457
01:12:31,980 --> 01:12:34,505
I get it. Money, huh? Money?

1458
01:12:34,583 --> 01:12:37,108
Paolo, when did you get to New York,
and why didn't you call me?

1459
01:12:37,186 --> 01:12:40,053
I'm only here one week.
I mean, tomorrow I have show opening,

1460
01:12:40,122 --> 01:12:43,114
tonight we're out to celebrate, I did...

1461
01:12:43,192 --> 01:12:46,593
You must join us.
To celebrate. Tonight.

1462
01:12:46,662 --> 01:12:49,563
Oh, come on. Huh?

1463
01:12:49,631 --> 01:12:52,191
Well, you wouldn't mind
if I went with them, would you?

1464
01:12:54,103 --> 01:12:57,732
I mean, you wanted to
go home anyway, right?

1465
01:13:01,577 --> 01:13:03,772
Euro-trash piece of fucking shit.

1466
01:13:03,846 --> 01:13:06,007
If that's what you want to go home with.

1467
01:13:06,081 --> 01:13:08,982
I mean, fuck!

1468
01:13:10,686 --> 01:13:11,744
Sorry about that.

1469
01:13:11,820 --> 01:13:13,082
Have a good evening.

1470
01:13:32,441 --> 01:13:35,239
Hey, Samantha, it's Thomas.

1471
01:13:35,310 --> 01:13:37,904
It's about 11:00 Saturday night.

1472
01:13:37,980 --> 01:13:40,312
I would love to see you,
so give me a call back.

1473
01:13:40,382 --> 01:13:41,644
All right.

1474
01:13:45,354 --> 01:13:47,879
Amy. Tom.

1475
01:13:47,956 --> 01:13:51,153
Hey. Saturday night, about 10.

1476
01:13:54,129 --> 01:13:55,426
I'd love to see you.

1477
01:13:58,000 --> 01:13:59,467
Jen.

1478
01:13:59,535 --> 01:14:02,561
It's your favorite co-worker, Tommy.

1479
01:14:02,638 --> 01:14:04,071
I'd love to see you,

1480
01:14:04,139 --> 01:14:06,573
even if it's late.

1481
01:14:06,642 --> 01:14:08,166
So call me back.

1482
01:14:09,845 --> 01:14:11,073
Fuck.

1483
01:14:26,395 --> 01:14:29,091
You should hear some of the things
he says about you.

1484
01:14:30,499 --> 01:14:32,296
I think I have an idea.

1485
01:14:36,972 --> 01:14:39,600
I spent so much time hating you.

1486
01:14:39,675 --> 01:14:41,404
I don't know what to believe.

1487
01:15:12,608 --> 01:15:15,008
Hey, Beth.
How's girls' night out going?

1488
01:15:15,077 --> 01:15:18,706
Tommy, I don't want to see you again.

1489
01:15:18,780 --> 01:15:19,838
Ever.

1490
01:15:19,915 --> 01:15:21,405
Whoa... Wait, Beth.

1491
01:15:21,483 --> 01:15:23,747
What are you talking about?
That's... Where are you?

1492
01:15:23,819 --> 01:15:26,720
I know about Christie, Tommy.

1493
01:15:26,788 --> 01:15:28,415
- Everything.
- No, what are you...

1494
01:15:28,490 --> 01:15:30,219
Beth, this is crazy.

1495
01:15:30,292 --> 01:15:33,728
No, it's not, actually.

1496
01:15:33,795 --> 01:15:35,023
Well, not anymore.

1497
01:15:35,097 --> 01:15:36,758
Who have you been talking to?

1498
01:15:36,832 --> 01:15:39,767
Beth. Beth!

1499
01:15:41,570 --> 01:15:42,696
Fuck.

1500
01:15:48,544 --> 01:15:50,842
Hey, you know what, buddy?

1501
01:15:50,913 --> 01:15:53,404
Change of plans.
We're gonna be staying downtown.

1502
01:15:55,050 --> 01:15:56,608
Coming.

1503
01:16:01,990 --> 01:16:03,184
Hey.

1504
01:16:04,192 --> 01:16:05,181
- Hey.
- What's up?

1505
01:16:05,260 --> 01:16:06,852
What's going on, man?

1506
01:16:06,929 --> 01:16:08,021
You, uh...

1507
01:16:09,998 --> 01:16:12,262
You haven't spoken to Beth tonight

1508
01:16:12,334 --> 01:16:14,734
by any chance, have you?

1509
01:16:14,803 --> 01:16:16,998
Well, yeah, but I didn't
think it was a big deal.

1510
01:16:18,540 --> 01:16:19,973
Well, it is a big deal, Daniel.

1511
01:16:20,042 --> 01:16:21,373
It's a big fucking deal.

1512
01:16:21,443 --> 01:16:23,877
- Why? - 'Cause you told her
I was fucking Christie.

1513
01:16:23,946 --> 01:16:25,607
I don't even know what...

1514
01:16:25,681 --> 01:16:29,173
You want to fuck my girl,
don't you, you little fucking cunt?

1515
01:16:29,251 --> 01:16:30,582
I didn't say anything.

1516
01:16:30,652 --> 01:16:32,279
You didn't say anything?
Why would you call her, huh?

1517
01:16:32,354 --> 01:16:34,720
- Huh?
- She called me.

1518
01:16:34,790 --> 01:16:36,917
We talked for two minutes
about a book we were reading.

1519
01:16:36,992 --> 01:16:39,358
That's it.

1520
01:16:49,771 --> 01:16:50,760
Book club.

1521
01:16:50,839 --> 01:16:52,363
Yeah.

1522
01:16:52,441 --> 01:16:53,567
Oh, now I understand.

1523
01:16:53,642 --> 01:16:55,633
You can understand
why I misinterpreted...

1524
01:16:55,711 --> 01:16:57,611
Actually, I can't, Tommy.

1525
01:16:57,713 --> 01:17:00,443
Hurt me as much as it did you.

1526
01:17:00,482 --> 01:17:02,040
I'm sure we'll be laughing
about it on Monday.

1527
01:17:02,117 --> 01:17:03,948
Look, I'll take you out to lunch, okay?

1528
01:17:05,520 --> 01:17:07,283
- Yeah.
- All right, all right.

1529
01:17:07,356 --> 01:17:10,587
Look, you think it over,
you get that fixed up.

1530
01:17:10,659 --> 01:17:12,251
Monday we'll straighten
this whole thing out.

1531
01:17:12,327 --> 01:17:13,817
I don't think so, Tommy.

1532
01:17:16,765 --> 01:17:18,699
Daniel, come on, don't...

1533
01:17:18,767 --> 01:17:19,825
Go home, Tommy.

1534
01:17:21,236 --> 01:17:22,703
Just go home.

1535
01:17:30,812 --> 01:17:33,007
Sounds good. Okay. Okay.

1536
01:18:02,077 --> 01:18:04,272
84th and 5th.

1537
01:18:21,430 --> 01:18:23,523
$8.20, please.

1538
01:18:29,471 --> 01:18:31,371
I think I lost my wallet.

1539
01:18:31,440 --> 01:18:32,930
$8.20, sir.

1540
01:18:34,576 --> 01:18:36,066
I think I lost my wallet, sir.

1541
01:18:36,144 --> 01:18:37,702
We can go ATM.

1542
01:18:37,779 --> 01:18:39,644
No, my cards are in my wallet.

1543
01:18:39,715 --> 01:18:41,182
But, you know,
I'll tell you what.

1544
01:18:41,249 --> 01:18:43,547
I have money upstairs.
If you just wait here for a couple minutes,

1545
01:18:43,618 --> 01:18:45,813
I'll run up, I'll grab it,
I'll bring it down for you.

1546
01:18:45,887 --> 01:18:47,582
Get the fuck out of my taxi.

1547
01:19:10,212 --> 01:19:12,442
- Hey, Beth.
- Hey.

1548
01:19:12,514 --> 01:19:16,382
Sorry. Um, do you
still have company?

1549
01:19:16,451 --> 01:19:19,079
No. No, not at all.
Are you okay?

1550
01:19:19,154 --> 01:19:20,246
Can I ask a favor?

1551
01:19:21,690 --> 01:19:25,148
You can say no, but, um...

1552
01:19:25,227 --> 01:19:26,626
please don't say no, okay?

1553
01:19:26,695 --> 01:19:29,323
Beth, Beth, I'll be right there.

1554
01:19:49,084 --> 01:19:51,644
It's been a while, Tommy.

1555
01:19:53,488 --> 01:19:55,649
Evening, Miss Perkins.

1556
01:19:59,628 --> 01:20:01,323
Your place looks nice.

1557
01:20:06,401 --> 01:20:07,891
Did you miss me?

1558
01:20:47,576 --> 01:20:49,237
What did you do now?

1559
01:20:59,554 --> 01:21:01,419
Hi, Christie, it's Mom.

1560
01:21:01,489 --> 01:21:03,184
Call me when you get a chance.

1561
01:21:04,726 --> 01:21:06,694
Hey, it's Tommy.

1562
01:21:06,761 --> 01:21:08,854
I'm just gonna crash
at my place tonight, okay?

1563
01:21:08,930 --> 01:21:11,398
- You fucking asshole.
- Love you.

1564
01:21:11,466 --> 01:21:12,558
Fuck.

1565
01:21:21,610 --> 01:21:23,373
- Hey.
- Hey.

1566
01:21:23,445 --> 01:21:24,776
- What?
- Yeah.

1567
01:21:24,846 --> 01:21:26,404
What happened?

1568
01:21:26,481 --> 01:21:28,278
I guess Tommy's
having a rough night.

1569
01:21:28,350 --> 01:21:29,374
Tommy did that?

1570
01:21:29,451 --> 01:21:30,782
Why would he...

1571
01:21:30,852 --> 01:21:32,843
I guess he thought that I...

1572
01:21:32,921 --> 01:21:35,515
- That I told you about Christie.
- How would you even...

1573
01:21:40,462 --> 01:21:42,794
- Wow. Is everybody fucking left-handed?
- You knew?

1574
01:21:42,864 --> 01:21:45,958
- The whole time?
- No. Not the whole time.

1575
01:21:46,034 --> 01:21:47,023
Why didn't you tell me?

1576
01:21:47,102 --> 01:21:49,696
- I should have.
- No.

1577
01:21:49,771 --> 01:21:52,672
You have your job to think about,

1578
01:21:52,741 --> 01:21:54,299
and your friends.

1579
01:21:54,376 --> 01:21:56,844
Beth, I quit my job.

1580
01:21:58,380 --> 01:22:00,109
Those aren't my friends.

1581
01:22:01,216 --> 01:22:02,740
It's just you.

1582
01:22:10,859 --> 01:22:13,225
Baby, you're a little light here.

1583
01:22:13,295 --> 01:22:15,695
I know. I'll make it up to you.

1584
01:22:17,399 --> 01:22:19,629
I'm sorry, baby, but you know
it doesn't work that way.

1585
01:22:19,701 --> 01:22:21,999
Look, I lost my wallet tonight.

1586
01:22:22,070 --> 01:22:23,469
And I will make it up to you.

1587
01:22:23,538 --> 01:22:25,665
- I promise.
- Listen, motherfucker.

1588
01:22:25,740 --> 01:22:27,970
You will get me
my motherfucking money

1589
01:22:28,043 --> 01:22:29,738
or I'm gonna fucking scream
until the fucking cops come.

1590
01:22:29,811 --> 01:22:32,575
And that would fuck you a lot more
than it would fuck me.

1591
01:22:32,647 --> 01:22:33,909
Okay, how about we just calm down.

1592
01:22:33,982 --> 01:22:36,610
And I'll find a way to get
your money for you, okay?

1593
01:22:36,685 --> 01:22:40,382
Just give me a minute
to think about it.

1594
01:22:40,455 --> 01:22:43,390
Okay, baby.
Whenever you're ready.

1595
01:22:48,263 --> 01:22:52,393
- Irv, how's it going?
- You can't go up there, son.

1596
01:22:52,467 --> 01:22:54,662
I just need to talk
to Christie for a second.

1597
01:22:54,736 --> 01:22:56,670
You're no longer on the guest list.

1598
01:22:59,474 --> 01:23:01,601
Irv, look, my man,
I'm up there all the time.

1599
01:23:01,676 --> 01:23:04,440
Donny, show this man to the door.

1600
01:24:07,409 --> 01:24:09,343
I feel sorry for you, Tommy.

1601
01:24:11,079 --> 01:24:12,137
I do.

1602
01:24:20,922 --> 01:24:22,082
Thanks, baby.

1603
01:24:24,859 --> 01:24:26,156
Two stops, please.

1604
01:24:37,005 --> 01:24:40,202
So, that's how we got here.

1605
01:24:42,277 --> 01:24:43,505
It's not pretty.

1606
01:24:43,578 --> 01:24:45,603
I know.

1607
01:24:48,483 --> 01:24:51,452
I really don't have anything left
to say for myself.

1608
01:24:54,355 --> 01:24:55,982
Maybe that's a start.

1609
01:24:58,426 --> 01:25:00,121
So, what are you gonna do now?

1610
01:25:01,863 --> 01:25:03,057
I don't know.

1611
01:25:04,332 --> 01:25:05,321
Chris Baker,

1612
01:25:05,400 --> 01:25:07,595
he keeps asking me to join
him at his new place,

1613
01:25:07,669 --> 01:25:12,732
but I'm just not sure that's
what I want to do right now.

1614
01:25:16,044 --> 01:25:18,410
Have you ever been up
in a hot air balloon?

1615
01:25:19,781 --> 01:25:20,805
What?

1616
01:25:22,050 --> 01:25:24,382
Never mind.

1617
01:25:53,882 --> 01:25:55,747
Tommy.

1618
01:26:12,734 --> 01:26:14,224
<i>Buon giorno, carissima.</i>

1619
01:26:21,075 --> 01:26:24,408
Why did you come back
in that restaurant for my number?

1620
01:26:25,647 --> 01:26:27,046
I just couldn't be with that other girl

1621
01:26:27,115 --> 01:26:28,742
when all I wanted was to talk to you.

1622
01:26:40,828 --> 01:26:42,921
Whatever happened to her, anyway?

1623
01:26:45,833 --> 01:26:47,266
Just wasn't right.

1624
01:26:50,338 --> 01:26:52,966
When you flipped that coin,

1625
01:26:53,041 --> 01:26:56,204
and I said I wanted to stay,

1626
01:26:56,277 --> 01:26:58,438
I don't think I realized it then,

1627
01:26:58,546 --> 01:27:02,482
but I was thinking
about you when I said it.

1628
01:27:02,517 --> 01:27:03,916
I know.

1629
01:27:06,888 --> 01:27:09,049
So, what was it?

1630
01:27:09,123 --> 01:27:11,557
What was what?

1631
01:27:11,626 --> 01:27:12,752
Heads or tails?

1632
01:27:14,095 --> 01:27:15,653
Stay or leave?

1633
01:27:22,370 --> 01:27:23,769
That's what I thought.

1634
01:27:43,458 --> 01:27:46,552
