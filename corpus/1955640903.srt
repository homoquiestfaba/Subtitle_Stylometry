I cannot decide if I wanted
the gold or silver,

grades were good next quarter,

18

then they'd get me both.
You're so lucky.

Someone's been hired to kill you.
That's insane.

108
00:12:20,022 --> 00:12:22,356
Does this have something
to do with my father?

109

Did he say anything?

110
00:12:37,072 --> 00:12:38,405

Okay.

150

But, um... I had an MRI once

151
00:16:26,601 --> 00:16:28,512
and the nurse talked me
through the whole thing,

152
00:16:28,536 --> 00:16:30,704
so do you mind doing that?

153
00:16:30,739 --> 00:16:32,939

The whole reason
I'm in this stupid trunk

166

is 'cause of him.

167
00:17:17,786 --> 00:17:20,553
It's all his fault.

He's such an asshole.

169
00:17:24,626 --> 00:17:27,394
Then my mom dies
and he marries a total bitch.

God, I hate them.

171
00:17:32,801 --> 00:17:34,835

He was barking away.

187
00:18:42,470 --> 00:18:43,804
Just wanted to play.

188
00:18:45,473 --> 00:18:47,640
And my group leader goes,
"You got to do something."

189
00:18:47,675 --> 00:18:49,376
He's going to give us away.

190
00:18:51,079 --> 00:18:53,113
So I started playing with him.

191
00:18:53,148 --> 00:18:55,482
He's barking away.

192
00:18:58,086 --> 00:18:59,820
He comes over to me.

193
00:19:03,725 --> 00:19:05,425
Trusted me.

194
00:19:11,032 --> 00:19:13,667
I slit his throat with my knife.

195
00:19:15,703 --> 00:19:19,806
Three days I stayed there,
just elbow-deep in his blood.

196
00:19:28,183 --> 00:19:30,584
Funny thing,
we were in the wrong place...

197
00:19:32,654 --> 00:19:35,122
just watching
a civilian's house.

198
00:19:39,594 --> 00:19:42,562
So if I can do that...

199
00:19:42,597 --> 00:19:44,965
you can stay in that trunk.

200
00:19:51,873 --> 00:19:53,607
Okay, no more talking now.

201
00:19:57,645 --> 00:19:59,765
( Indistinct chatter over PA )

202
00:20:04,652 --> 00:20:09,089
( chattering in French )

203
00:20:15,096 --> 00:20:16,897
Whoa.

204
00:20:24,973 --> 00:20:26,873
( Speaks French )

205
00:21:07,282 --> 00:21:08,615
Again.

206
00:21:10,985 --> 00:21:13,119
( Dogs barking )

207
00:21:13,154 --> 00:21:15,021
Keep at it.

208
00:21:20,895 --> 00:21:24,597
( Growling )

209
00:21:24,632 --> 00:21:26,900
( growling )

210
00:21:30,638 --> 00:21:32,105
Nice dogs.

211
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:34,151
I don't think I've seen
these ones before.

212
00:21:34,175 --> 00:21:37,210
They're young,
from a newer litter.

213
00:21:37,245 --> 00:21:39,045
Haus!

214
00:21:45,053 --> 00:21:46,886
You're not bringing me
good news.

215
00:21:46,921 --> 00:21:48,966
I appreciate that you want
to send a message,

216
00:21:48,990 --> 00:21:51,624
but this is turning into
a major-league clusterfuck.

217
00:21:51,659 --> 00:21:53,604
I was forced to use
outside help.

218
00:21:53,628 --> 00:21:55,239
Metzger is back from the States.

219
00:21:55,263 --> 00:21:57,864
His people shall handle things
more efficiently.

220
00:21:57,899 --> 00:21:59,710
All you have to do
is find the girl.

221
00:21:59,734 --> 00:22:01,868
If Metzger's already taken care
of our main problem,

222
00:22:01,903 --> 00:22:03,147
we can forget about the girl.

223
00:22:03,171 --> 00:22:05,238
I finish what I start.

224
00:22:05,273 --> 00:22:08,708
And when we find the girl,
we find Lucas.

225
00:22:08,743 --> 00:22:11,244
We've got other problems
besides the girl, Richard.

226
00:22:11,279 --> 00:22:13,046
Like what?

227
00:22:13,081 --> 00:22:15,715
Her father wasn't just planning
to sell you out to the feds.

228
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:18,018
He diverted funds
from your US accounts.

229
00:22:19,354 --> 00:22:21,555
How much? 25 million.

230
00:22:22,757 --> 00:22:24,991
( Scoffs )

231
00:22:25,026 --> 00:22:26,192
Get it back.

232
00:22:26,227 --> 00:22:27,861
We don't know where it is.

233
00:22:29,330 --> 00:22:30,730
Metzger found something

234
00:22:30,765 --> 00:22:33,005
that might make your job
a little easier.

235
00:22:34,202 --> 00:22:36,322
This belonged to Martin Hatto.

236
00:22:37,105 --> 00:22:38,304
I'll do what I can.

237
00:22:38,339 --> 00:22:41,341
I don't think you understand.

238
00:22:41,376 --> 00:22:43,943
I will not be made a fool of.

239
00:22:43,978 --> 00:22:45,345
Find the girl,

240
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:47,213
find Lucas,

241
00:22:47,248 --> 00:22:49,448
and get me my fucking money.

242
00:22:56,391 --> 00:22:58,291
( Sighs )

243
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:06,800
Do you feel that's good enough?

244
00:23:08,269 --> 00:23:10,550
I'll keep practicing, sir.

245
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:23,283
( Engine starts )

246
00:23:33,261 --> 00:23:35,795
Hey, quite a place
you've got here.

247
00:23:35,830 --> 00:23:38,865
Where did you find him?
Manchester.

248
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:41,078
I've never had one of these
on before, you know.

249
00:23:41,102 --> 00:23:42,382
No one will miss him.

250
00:23:48,309 --> 00:23:51,144
( Dog snarling )

251
00:23:51,179 --> 00:23:52,756
Man: What is that?

252
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:54,881
A breed I'm developing.

253
00:23:54,916 --> 00:23:59,018
Man: You want me to go
in there with that?

254
00:23:59,053 --> 00:24:02,221
Only for a moment to make sure
the dog knows its job.

255
00:24:02,256 --> 00:24:04,023
Now, let's go.

256
00:24:04,058 --> 00:24:06,136
All of this equipment
will keep you well protected.

257
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:08,127
I really don't know about this.

258
00:24:08,162 --> 00:24:10,474
Richard: The most important
thing for this test's success

259
00:24:10,498 --> 00:24:12,031
is not to show fear.

260
00:24:12,066 --> 00:24:13,733
Try to seem like the aggressor.

261
00:24:13,768 --> 00:24:15,935
( Barking and snarling )

262
00:24:18,339 --> 00:24:19,339
Fass!

263
00:24:22,410 --> 00:24:24,043
( screaming )

264
00:24:24,078 --> 00:24:25,712
( fabric tearing )

265
00:24:25,747 --> 00:24:29,415
( screaming )

266
00:24:29,450 --> 00:24:32,085
( bones cracking )

267
00:25:04,252 --> 00:25:06,186
( phone line ringing )

268
00:25:09,390 --> 00:25:11,958
( phone rings )

269
00:25:11,993 --> 00:25:14,360
I've been expecting your call.

270
00:25:14,395 --> 00:25:16,896
How did you find them?

271
00:25:16,931 --> 00:25:19,966
I make sure I always know
everything I can

272
00:25:20,001 --> 00:25:22,068
about my employees.

273
00:25:22,103 --> 00:25:25,171
Teresa's still
a good-looking woman.

274
00:25:26,474 --> 00:25:28,908
Oh, and...

275
00:25:28,943 --> 00:25:31,444
Jillian's swim team
won their final.

276
00:25:31,479 --> 00:25:33,513
Congratulations.

277
00:25:33,548 --> 00:25:37,316
I'm guessing Ella Hatto
reminded you of your daughter.

278
00:25:37,351 --> 00:25:38,985
Why do you want her dead?

279
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:42,388
Her father betrayed me.
He had to be punished.

280
00:25:42,423 --> 00:25:44,524
He stole a lot of money.

281
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:46,859
Your delay forced my hand.

282
00:25:46,894 --> 00:25:48,539
I had to send Metzger overseas

283
00:25:48,563 --> 00:25:50,474
to pay Mr. Hatto
and his wife a visit.

284
00:25:50,498 --> 00:25:54,367
Well, if that's true
and I do this...

285
00:25:54,402 --> 00:25:56,402
aren't you just punishing
a dead man?

286
00:25:56,437 --> 00:25:58,271
( Sighs )

287
00:25:58,306 --> 00:26:01,541
Lucas, do know how many people
are in my employ?

288
00:26:01,576 --> 00:26:06,145
If I let one steal from me,
what are the rest to think?

289
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:09,248
The message
is not for Martin Hatto.

290
00:26:09,283 --> 00:26:11,417
It is for them.

291
00:26:11,452 --> 00:26:13,019
Lucas...

292
00:26:13,054 --> 00:26:16,823
you have such potential,
such talent.

293
00:26:16,858 --> 00:26:18,991
A fine weapon, Lucas.
You're a hunter.

294
00:26:19,026 --> 00:26:20,960
That's what you are.

295
00:26:22,530 --> 00:26:24,308
At the moment, you're confused.

296
00:26:24,332 --> 00:26:28,367
I expect your supply
is running low.

297
00:26:28,402 --> 00:26:31,504
Must be difficult...
I'd say impossible...

298
00:26:31,539 --> 00:26:33,250
To find a cocktail
of the quality

299
00:26:33,274 --> 00:26:36,175
I supply you with
on the streets.

300
00:26:36,210 --> 00:26:38,911
You don't know what
you're doing with this girl.

301
00:26:38,946 --> 00:26:40,313
But one way or another,

302
00:26:40,348 --> 00:26:42,048
this girl will die.

303
00:26:42,083 --> 00:26:43,416
You have to know that.

304
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:48,021
Just say a prayer for her
and be done.

305
00:27:21,322 --> 00:27:22,922
You left me in there?

306
00:27:38,673 --> 00:27:40,206
( Lock clicks )

307
00:27:46,414 --> 00:27:48,014
Can I use the bathroom?

308
00:27:50,017 --> 00:27:51,584
Yeah. Okay.

309
00:28:14,709 --> 00:28:17,076
( Dial tone )

310
00:28:26,687 --> 00:28:28,454
( line ringing )

311
00:28:32,026 --> 00:28:33,303
Woman: Hello?

312
00:28:33,327 --> 00:28:34,327
Who's this?

313
00:28:35,730 --> 00:28:38,030
I'm trying to reach my dad.

314
00:28:38,065 --> 00:28:39,665
Martin Hatto?

315
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:43,135
Yeah, it's his daughter, Ella.
Can you put him on?

316
00:28:43,170 --> 00:28:44,971
I'm afraid I can't do that.

317
00:28:45,006 --> 00:28:48,374
Ella, this is Special Agent
Gina Banks with the FBI.

318
00:28:48,409 --> 00:28:50,676
I work with Interpol. What?

319
00:28:50,711 --> 00:28:53,245
You need to tell me
where you are.

320
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:54,981
I-I don't know.

321
00:28:55,016 --> 00:28:57,136
Are you with a man
who calls himself Lucas?

322
00:28:59,353 --> 00:29:00,653
Yeah.

323
00:29:00,688 --> 00:29:02,688
Ella, listen to me
very carefully.

324
00:29:02,723 --> 00:29:05,257
He's a professional assassin.

325
00:29:05,292 --> 00:29:07,694
We believe he's been hired
to kill you.

326
00:29:11,766 --> 00:29:13,543
Were going to trace
this number, Ella,

327
00:29:13,567 --> 00:29:15,727
and we're going to get help
to you right away.

328
00:29:18,105 --> 00:29:20,072
Ella...

329
00:29:20,107 --> 00:29:21,307
are you there?

330
00:29:21,342 --> 00:29:23,009
( knock on door )

331
00:29:24,245 --> 00:29:25,545
Yeah, just a second.

332
00:29:32,219 --> 00:29:33,552
Ella.

333
00:29:33,587 --> 00:29:35,554
( Whispers ) I have to go.

334
00:29:35,589 --> 00:29:36,622
Please help me.

335
00:29:36,657 --> 00:29:38,591
Ella.

336
00:30:02,750 --> 00:30:04,317
Um...

337
00:30:06,487 --> 00:30:09,288
I have to get to the car.
I, um...

338
00:30:12,359 --> 00:30:14,761
I left something in the...
In the trunk of the...

339
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:28,474
Are you going to kill me?

340
00:30:31,278 --> 00:30:32,645
Yes.

341
00:30:35,449 --> 00:30:37,250
( Screams ) No!

342
00:30:51,599 --> 00:30:52,799
No.

343
00:30:59,206 --> 00:31:00,640
( Sniffles ) Please.

344
00:31:03,344 --> 00:31:05,578
Please, you don't
have to do this.

345
00:31:05,613 --> 00:31:07,647
You don't have to.

346
00:31:09,350 --> 00:31:11,183
Please.

347
00:31:11,218 --> 00:31:12,652
( Crying ) Please.

348
00:32:07,208 --> 00:32:09,208
( Tires squeal )

349
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:13,379
No, no, no,
I'm not going to hurt you.

350
00:32:13,414 --> 00:32:14,814
I'm not going to hurt you.

351
00:32:17,685 --> 00:32:19,218
Look, look.

352
00:32:22,957 --> 00:32:24,857
Okay? It's not...

353
00:32:24,892 --> 00:32:27,760
I'm not gonna
do anything to you.

354
00:32:29,563 --> 00:32:31,497
All right? Just...

355
00:32:38,439 --> 00:32:40,940
( exhales )

356
00:32:40,975 --> 00:32:43,275
Look, I was hired to kill you,

357
00:32:43,310 --> 00:32:47,313
but I'm not going
to do it 'cause...

358
00:32:49,383 --> 00:32:51,584
I can't... do it.

359
00:32:53,587 --> 00:32:54,787
I can't.

360
00:33:06,734 --> 00:33:08,567
I need to call home.

361
00:33:08,602 --> 00:33:09,936
I need to call my dad.

362
00:33:14,842 --> 00:33:16,542
Let me speak to my dad.

363
00:33:20,447 --> 00:33:21,881
Your father's dead.

364
00:33:39,466 --> 00:33:42,635
I was meant to kill you first
as a message.

365
00:33:44,371 --> 00:33:46,438
I couldn't bring myself
to do it.

366
00:33:46,473 --> 00:33:48,874
I waited too long.

367
00:33:48,909 --> 00:33:50,843
So they killed
your whole family.

368
00:33:58,052 --> 00:33:59,986
Now they're gonna want
to kill us both.

369
00:34:01,789 --> 00:34:03,856
( Chatter over radio )

370
00:34:40,094 --> 00:34:42,534
I didn't know what you'd like.

371
00:35:00,514 --> 00:35:02,881
You should eat something.

372
00:35:02,916 --> 00:35:05,551
We're gonna be on the run,

373
00:35:05,586 --> 00:35:08,053
and you're gonna need
your strength.

374
00:35:08,088 --> 00:35:10,589
All that stuff I said
about my dad.

375
00:35:13,594 --> 00:35:14,660
I didn't mean it.

376
00:35:15,929 --> 00:35:17,396
I know.

377
00:35:27,408 --> 00:35:29,641
( Gunshots ) ( screams )

378
00:35:29,676 --> 00:35:31,677
( screams ) Stay down!

379
00:35:35,149 --> 00:35:36,149
Come on.

380
00:35:37,885 --> 00:35:39,685
Stay down.

381
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:41,354
Stay low!

382
00:35:49,997 --> 00:35:51,557
Down! ( Screams )

383
00:36:16,023 --> 00:36:18,858
( panting )

384
00:36:28,068 --> 00:36:30,436
( both grunting )

385
00:37:24,057 --> 00:37:25,458
( grunts )

386
00:37:31,932 --> 00:37:33,732
( gasps ) ( rifle cocks )

387
00:37:34,868 --> 00:37:35,948
( screams )

388
00:37:38,939 --> 00:37:41,106
Ella, get in!

389
00:37:41,141 --> 00:37:42,585
Come on, there could
be more of them.

390
00:37:42,609 --> 00:37:43,876
Come on!

391
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:11,870
You... you drive.

392
00:38:11,905 --> 00:38:13,205
You drive.

393
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:14,240
Wha...?

394
00:38:14,274 --> 00:38:16,041
( Grunting )

395
00:38:45,272 --> 00:38:47,152
Just keep your eyes on the road.

396
00:38:49,943 --> 00:38:52,545
Are... are you a diabetic?

397
00:38:57,084 --> 00:38:59,324
It helps me do
what I have to do.

398
00:39:02,956 --> 00:39:04,716
( Horn honks ) ( screams )

399
00:39:13,367 --> 00:39:15,267
( groans )

400
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:21,673
I'm sorry.

401
00:39:21,708 --> 00:39:23,875
( Train bell ringing )

402
00:39:23,910 --> 00:39:27,646
( horn blaring )

403
00:39:31,985 --> 00:39:33,786
Hey, Dani, it's me.

404
00:39:35,856 --> 00:39:37,189
Yeah.

405
00:39:39,259 --> 00:39:41,727
( Woman speaking French
over PA )

406
00:39:49,002 --> 00:39:51,236
( bell chimes )

407
00:39:51,271 --> 00:39:53,606
( man speaking French over PA )

408
00:40:08,255 --> 00:40:09,788
( line rings )

409
00:40:11,291 --> 00:40:13,025
( phone rings )

410
00:40:14,428 --> 00:40:15,694
Hello?

411
00:40:19,299 --> 00:40:20,933
Hello?

412
00:40:24,438 --> 00:40:26,071
Who is this?

413
00:40:35,749 --> 00:40:38,851
Mom, who was that?
It was no one.

414
00:40:48,462 --> 00:40:51,963
Got a friend that's gonna
meet us on the train.

415
00:40:51,998 --> 00:40:54,166
Her name's Dani.

416
00:40:54,201 --> 00:40:55,767
She's fixed me up before.

417
00:40:55,802 --> 00:40:58,437
( Train bell ringing )

418
00:40:58,472 --> 00:41:02,874
( speaks French )

419
00:41:02,909 --> 00:41:04,976
Paris.

420
00:41:05,011 --> 00:41:07,411
May I please see
your identification?

421
00:41:08,081 --> 00:41:09,081
Merci.

422
00:41:10,784 --> 00:41:11,824
Hers?

423
00:41:16,790 --> 00:41:19,458
I left it on the hotel.

424
00:41:19,493 --> 00:41:21,293
Right, Dad?

425
00:41:26,199 --> 00:41:27,900
She left it in the hotel.

426
00:41:31,838 --> 00:41:33,872
Okay, okay.

427
00:41:33,907 --> 00:41:35,307
Bon voyage.

428
00:41:42,983 --> 00:41:44,750
That was good.

429
00:41:44,785 --> 00:41:46,185
( Train approaching )

430
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:54,960
( classical music playing )

431
00:41:54,995 --> 00:41:57,295
While obviously we can't
mention clients by name,

432
00:41:57,330 --> 00:41:59,965
our firm has handled
sensitive issues

433
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,367
for many high-profile
individuals such as yourself.

434
00:42:02,402 --> 00:42:04,503
I like to think of myself
as unique.

435
00:42:04,538 --> 00:42:06,838
Of course, and at Ashland
Phillips & Hornick

436
00:42:06,873 --> 00:42:08,084
you will be treated as such.

437
00:42:08,108 --> 00:42:09,318
Richard: As you probably know,

438
00:42:09,342 --> 00:42:11,343
my previous attorney
died unexpectedly.

439
00:42:11,378 --> 00:42:13,378
Martin Hatto.

440
00:42:13,413 --> 00:42:17,349
Mr. Hatto handled a number
of sensitive issues

441
00:42:17,384 --> 00:42:19,351
involving my US interests.

442
00:42:19,386 --> 00:42:22,120
At the time of his death,
Martin was having

443
00:42:22,155 --> 00:42:26,525
his own legal difficulties
with the IRS.

444
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:28,927
This was very disappointing
to me.

445
00:42:28,962 --> 00:42:30,740
Woman: And you believe
he may have violated

446
00:42:30,764 --> 00:42:32,531
attorney-client privilege?

447
00:42:32,566 --> 00:42:35,467
I honestly don't know
if he was making an agreement

448
00:42:35,502 --> 00:42:38,403
with your government,
turning over information

449
00:42:38,438 --> 00:42:41,206
that could jeopardize
my operations.

450
00:42:41,241 --> 00:42:44,242
Man: Mr. Addison,
let's speak frankly.

451
00:42:44,277 --> 00:42:48,847
The sale of narcotics generates
enormous amounts of cash.

452
00:42:48,882 --> 00:42:51,883
One needs a secure way
to launder those revenues

453
00:42:51,918 --> 00:42:53,418
in the US.

454
00:42:53,453 --> 00:42:56,154
Martin Hatto got greedy
and stole from you.

455
00:42:56,189 --> 00:42:57,489
We won't.

456
00:43:05,899 --> 00:43:07,543
Woman:
How are your school lessons?

457
00:43:07,567 --> 00:43:09,901
I got 90 on my algebra test.

458
00:43:09,936 --> 00:43:12,181
Oh, I'm so proud
of you, William.

459
00:43:12,205 --> 00:43:14,105
I did get one wrong.

460
00:43:14,140 --> 00:43:16,908
And how's everything at home?

461
00:43:16,943 --> 00:43:19,578
Hey, you can talk to me,
you know?

462
00:43:19,613 --> 00:43:21,446
Everything's fine.

463
00:43:21,481 --> 00:43:23,315
I miss you so much.

464
00:43:23,350 --> 00:43:25,851
I wish things were different.

465
00:43:31,892 --> 00:43:34,426
What have I told you
about your mother?

466
00:43:34,461 --> 00:43:36,228
My mother's a whore.

467
00:43:46,339 --> 00:43:48,240
( Sighs )

468
00:44:00,987 --> 00:44:03,121
- Lucas?
- Yeah.

469
00:44:05,058 --> 00:44:06,558
Dani: So that's her.

470
00:44:06,593 --> 00:44:08,493
Lucas: Yeah.

471
00:44:08,528 --> 00:44:11,096
Okay.

472
00:44:11,131 --> 00:44:12,531
Thanks for coming.

473
00:44:14,401 --> 00:44:16,178
I wish that just once
you'd call me up

474
00:44:16,202 --> 00:44:18,303
for dinner and a movie, hmm?

475
00:44:18,338 --> 00:44:19,605
( Groans )

476
00:44:22,142 --> 00:44:23,575
Slip in the shower?

477
00:44:23,610 --> 00:44:25,611
Yeah, something like that.

478
00:44:27,147 --> 00:44:28,980
They say you kidnapped her.

479
00:44:29,015 --> 00:44:30,949
It's not like that.

480
00:44:30,984 --> 00:44:33,485
It's all over the news.

481
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:35,554
Let's get started.

482
00:44:49,269 --> 00:44:50,602
Hey.

483
00:44:55,575 --> 00:44:57,042
Ella, this is Dani.

484
00:44:58,545 --> 00:45:02,347
Maybe you should go for a walk
while she finishes up.

485
00:45:24,537 --> 00:45:27,506
( Chatter )

486
00:45:46,559 --> 00:45:48,526
Johnny Walker, S'il vous plaît.

487
00:45:48,561 --> 00:45:50,429
( speaks French )

488
00:46:01,041 --> 00:46:02,641
All right if I join you?

489
00:46:07,514 --> 00:46:09,047
How is he doing?

490
00:46:13,486 --> 00:46:15,220
He'll be okay.

491
00:46:15,255 --> 00:46:17,022
He's fairly indestructible.

492
00:46:19,192 --> 00:46:20,525
May I ask you a question?

493
00:46:23,363 --> 00:46:25,030
What are you doing with him?

494
00:46:29,269 --> 00:46:31,603
He's all I got.

495
00:46:31,638 --> 00:46:33,171
Then you're really fucked up.

496
00:46:34,808 --> 00:46:38,610
Is it a schoolgirl crush
or just looking for Daddy, hmm?

497
00:46:40,747 --> 00:46:42,014
Sit.

498
00:46:44,551 --> 00:46:45,751
I'm trying to help you.

499
00:46:48,288 --> 00:46:52,090
If you think he cares
about you, you're wrong.

500
00:46:52,125 --> 00:46:56,094
The only thing
he cares about is his fix.

501
00:46:56,129 --> 00:46:59,497
Getting high,
that's all what he's about.

502
00:46:59,532 --> 00:47:03,501
He's a junkie,
always was and always will be.

503
00:47:03,536 --> 00:47:06,638
And I get it, there's a thrill
in trying to rescue a man.

504
00:47:06,673 --> 00:47:10,108
I mean, it's so exciting
when you think

505
00:47:10,143 --> 00:47:13,078
you have the power to awaken
something good inside him.

506
00:47:13,113 --> 00:47:16,081
Believe me, I know,
but this is not the case.

507
00:47:17,383 --> 00:47:20,418
Here is the sad truth
about Lucas.

508
00:47:20,453 --> 00:47:23,421
Whatever that was good
inside him

509
00:47:23,456 --> 00:47:26,391
died a long time ago.

510
00:47:27,527 --> 00:47:30,295
And it's not coming back.

511
00:47:30,330 --> 00:47:32,263
Not for you.

512
00:47:32,298 --> 00:47:34,533
Well, not for me,
not for anyone.

513
00:47:39,272 --> 00:47:42,107
So if I were you

514
00:47:42,142 --> 00:47:45,710
and had Richard Addison
trying to kill me,

515
00:47:45,745 --> 00:47:47,312
I'd take this,

516
00:47:47,347 --> 00:47:51,382
get off at the next station,
and I'd run.

517
00:47:51,417 --> 00:47:53,151
And don't look back.

518
00:48:04,631 --> 00:48:07,299
( Horn blares )
( indistinct announcement over PA )

519
00:48:10,503 --> 00:48:13,438
Hey, what are you doing?
Sit down.

520
00:48:13,473 --> 00:48:15,707
No, no, I feel good.
You did a good job.

521
00:48:15,742 --> 00:48:17,575
This isn't even your stop.

522
00:48:17,610 --> 00:48:19,488
Man over PA:
We are now arriving in Lille.

523
00:48:19,512 --> 00:48:22,680
Please ensure you take
all your belongings with you...

524
00:48:22,715 --> 00:48:25,250
Lucas, you know
what I'm thinking?

525
00:48:26,653 --> 00:48:28,587
I'm thinking of this.

526
00:48:35,728 --> 00:48:37,195
Just like in the old times.

527
00:48:43,469 --> 00:48:47,272
And this stuff
is amazing as gold.

528
00:48:57,951 --> 00:49:00,485
Where's Ella?

529
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:03,855
Um, she's in the dining car.
She's having some food.

530
00:49:03,890 --> 00:49:06,625
She's fine. You have time.

531
00:49:16,803 --> 00:49:17,836
Do it.

532
00:49:19,839 --> 00:49:22,507
Lucas, come on.
Your body wants it.

533
00:49:24,310 --> 00:49:26,511
Why do you want me
to do it so much?

534
00:49:30,817 --> 00:49:32,684
What is this?

535
00:49:32,719 --> 00:49:35,954
Magic.

536
00:49:35,989 --> 00:49:38,390
Pure magic.

537
00:49:39,993 --> 00:49:41,526
( Yelps )

538
00:49:41,561 --> 00:49:43,528
What's going on?

539
00:49:43,563 --> 00:49:45,563
Tell me! Don't! Addison.

540
00:49:45,598 --> 00:49:47,966
He's... he's put a price
on your head.

541
00:49:48,001 --> 00:49:49,434
Who's out there?

542
00:49:49,469 --> 00:49:51,669
Metzger.

543
00:49:51,704 --> 00:49:53,238
Damn it!

544
00:49:55,842 --> 00:49:56,842
Hey!

545
00:50:03,616 --> 00:50:05,717
Excuse me. Hi.

546
00:50:05,752 --> 00:50:08,653
You, uh...
You waiting on someone?

547
00:50:08,688 --> 00:50:11,289
Lucas: Ella, move! ( Screams )

548
00:50:11,324 --> 00:50:13,558
( crowd screaming )

549
00:50:33,780 --> 00:50:36,514
( horn blaring )
- Now!

550
00:50:48,328 --> 00:50:49,328

these questions.

Do you ever go online
and check your balance?

Yes.

737
01:08:06,064 --> 01:08:08,332
And when you do,
the log-in information,

738
01:08:08,367 --> 01:08:10,801
your username and password,

739
01:08:10,836 --> 01:08:12,980
do you have to look that up
or do you remember it?

740
01:08:13,004 --> 01:08:14,404
No, I remember it.

741
01:08:14,439 --> 01:08:18,475
Good.
Now we're getting somewhere.

742
01:08:18,510 --> 01:08:22,045
Ella, I need you
to fill this out.

743
01:08:22,080 --> 01:08:23,680
Just skip down to the bottom

744
01:08:23,715 --> 01:08:25,949
where it says
"login information."

745
01:08:25,984 --> 01:08:28,919
We just need that
and your signature, okay?

Yeah.

749

Um, how long until the airport?

750
01:08:43,435 --> 01:08:46,403
Just a few minutes.
It's right up ahead.

to do this differently.

She's been taken care of.

764

I guess all your trouble
was for nothing.

765

You're on the run
by now, I expect.

766

I don't suppose I'll find you.

767

Mr. Addison, a call for you.

Excuse me. Oh, of course.

She's just trying to stay alive.

790

with this myself.

Find Agatha. Sir.

798

No one's answering at the gate
