00:19:31,471 --> 00:19:33,039
Oh, my God!

347
00:19:33,572 --> 00:19:34,741
Whoa!

348
00:19:37,277 --> 00:19:39,411
Breasts are magical, man.
That's true.

349
00:19:39,478 --> 00:19:41,448
I want you to go in here,
I want you to see bush.

350
00:19:43,649 --> 00:19:45,752
Ladies.

351
00:19:45,818 --> 00:19:47,820
Eight feet with the ball.
Forget height.

352
00:19:47,887 --> 00:19:49,265
ERIC: All right, all
right, all right.

353
00:19:49,289 --> 00:19:50,989
Hey, hold it, fellas.
Hold on a minute.

354
00:19:51,056 --> 00:19:52,292
What's the matter
with you?

355
00:19:52,359 --> 00:19:53,960
I said, hold on
a minute.

356
00:19:54,025 --> 00:19:56,329
Dude. Your jock strap's
on a little tight, okay?

357
00:19:56,396 --> 00:19:57,663
What'd you say to me?

358
00:19:57,730 --> 00:19:59,130
I said, dude,
your jock strap's a...

359
00:20:00,599 --> 00:20:02,201
Holy shit!

360
00:20:03,469 --> 00:20:05,538
Dude, you just
got clocked!

361
00:20:05,605 --> 00:20:07,073
ERIC: Oh, is that
all you got?

362
00:20:07,138 --> 00:20:10,309
(CHUCKLING) I got something
special for you.
Oh, oh, oh, ma'am.

363
00:20:10,376 --> 00:20:11,987
My friend's a little
stressed out right now.

364
00:20:12,011 --> 00:20:14,281
I don't care.
I don't give a shit.
All right.

365
00:20:14,346 --> 00:20:16,158
ERIC: I'm gonna
knock you straight.
Come on. Oh, are you, huh?

366
00:20:16,182 --> 00:20:17,260
Yeah. Yeah.
Well, I got something

367
00:20:17,284 --> 00:20:18,785
for your little friend
here, too.

368
00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:20,229
Well, what did I do?
I'm very innocent.

369
00:20:20,253 --> 00:20:21,596
Yeah, bring it on,
bring it on.
Come on. Are you?

370
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:22,798
Get the hell
out of her.
Shut up!

371
00:20:22,822 --> 00:20:24,690
Go on, get out of here,
you little pissant.

372
00:20:24,757 --> 00:20:26,259
Hey, what's the matter
with you, huh?

373
00:20:33,733 --> 00:20:35,042
All right,
so it looks like
they're not coming,

374
00:20:35,066 --> 00:20:36,903
so this is for you.

375
00:20:36,968 --> 00:20:38,338
Thank you.
Thank you.

376
00:20:40,639 --> 00:20:43,310
Check this out.
I'm thinking about
getting married.

377
00:20:43,843 --> 00:20:45,143
No!

378
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:47,013
I gotta do it.
You don't
have to do it.

379
00:20:47,078 --> 00:20:50,582
I love her.
The fuck does that even
mean? It's a contract.

380
00:20:50,649 --> 00:20:52,217
The only reason
why people married

381
00:20:52,285 --> 00:20:54,219
is because people have
always gotten married.

382
00:20:54,287 --> 00:20:56,154
It's a fuckin'
stupid idea.

383
00:20:56,221 --> 00:20:58,590
I thought when
you get married,
it's for the...

384
00:20:58,657 --> 00:21:02,294
If it didn't exist
and somebody
brought it right now,

385
00:21:02,362 --> 00:21:03,730
someone came up
with the idea,

386
00:21:03,795 --> 00:21:05,798
everyone would go,
"Are you fuckin' crazy?"

387
00:21:05,864 --> 00:21:07,366
How you even...
What?

388
00:21:07,433 --> 00:21:09,701
You have to go
file in court,
sign some papers,

389
00:21:09,769 --> 00:21:12,171
and then when
you break up you gotta
hire a frickin' lawyer.

390
00:21:12,238 --> 00:21:13,681
I mean, there's
a six-month
cool-down period.

391
00:21:13,705 --> 00:21:15,182
Dawg, all I was trying
to tell you is that

392
00:21:15,206 --> 00:21:16,646
I was thinking about
getting married.

393
00:21:16,676 --> 00:21:18,445
And I'm telling you
it's a biological trick.

394
00:21:18,511 --> 00:21:20,989
First of all, she'd
never do that to me
'cause we're best friends.

395
00:21:21,013 --> 00:21:22,649
If she was really
your best friend,

396
00:21:22,714 --> 00:21:24,150
she would let you
fuck other chicks.

397
00:21:28,455 --> 00:21:31,122
(WOMAN CHATTERING OVER PA)

398
00:21:37,095 --> 00:21:38,297
That is so huge.

399
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:42,835
Did you tell him yet?
Oh, no.

400
00:21:44,504 --> 00:21:45,838
I didn't have a chance.

401
00:21:45,905 --> 00:21:47,639
And, you know, I was
waiting and waiting

402
00:21:47,706 --> 00:21:48,841
for a good time
to do it,

403
00:21:48,908 --> 00:21:51,142
and he just rushed out
and I couldn't do it.

404
00:21:51,209 --> 00:21:53,012
But I'm gonna do it.

405
00:21:54,881 --> 00:21:56,782
The reason why you get
so caught up in a woman

406
00:21:56,849 --> 00:21:58,717
is 'cause there's
crazy chemicals

407
00:21:58,784 --> 00:21:59,785
that your brain
puts out

408
00:21:59,852 --> 00:22:00,853
because you
wanna mate.

409
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:03,155
You wanna breed.
It's natural.

410
00:22:03,221 --> 00:22:04,990
You've thought about
this a lot, I see.

411
00:22:05,057 --> 00:22:06,734
Why do you think
it feels better
when you come inside?

412
00:22:06,758 --> 00:22:08,794
'Cause that's
how you make
fuckin' babies, dude.

413
00:22:08,861 --> 00:22:10,873
If it felt just
as good to jerk off
on a chick's back,

414
00:22:10,897 --> 00:22:13,400
everybody would
be jerking off
on chicks' backs.

415
00:22:13,465 --> 00:22:15,100
That's...
That's beautiful.

416
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:17,803
Listen, man.
Your girl's Latin.

417
00:22:17,870 --> 00:22:20,006
You come in her hair,
she's getting pregnant.

418
00:22:20,072 --> 00:22:21,316
Why do you think
there's so many
Puerto Ricans?

419
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:23,443
Wow, I don't know.
Puerto Rico's that big.

420
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:24,877
There's millions
of Puerto Ricans.

421
00:22:24,944 --> 00:22:25,977
What's up?

422
00:22:26,044 --> 00:22:27,914
Wow!

423
00:22:27,979 --> 00:22:30,883
It's not like
he's afraid
of marriage.

424
00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:33,420
I don't think
so. Right?

425
00:22:34,554 --> 00:22:38,690
Well, honey,
when is a man
ever ready?

426
00:22:38,757 --> 00:22:41,528
Oh, this is gonna
take our relationship
to a whole, whole...

427
00:22:41,593 --> 00:22:43,795
(SHRIEKS)
Oh, my God,

428
00:22:44,631 --> 00:22:47,066
to a whole new level.

429
00:22:47,133 --> 00:22:49,300
(WHISPERING)
What is he doing?

430
00:22:49,368 --> 00:22:51,688
Well, I just hope
he's getting good advice
from his friends.

431
00:22:52,604 --> 00:22:54,140
Oh, I hope so, too.
Uh-huh.

432
00:22:54,205 --> 00:22:55,807
Shit.

433
00:22:55,875 --> 00:22:59,011
When was the last time
you had diarrhea?
What?

434
00:22:59,078 --> 00:23:01,147
When was the last time
you had diarrhea?

435
00:23:01,212 --> 00:23:02,982
Dawg, I'm talking
about marriage.

436
00:23:03,049 --> 00:23:05,316
I'm talking about
a beautiful thing.

437
00:23:05,384 --> 00:23:07,118
I'm talking about
walking down the aisle...

438
00:23:07,185 --> 00:23:09,456
So am I. So am...
That's just
the first day.

439
00:23:09,521 --> 00:23:11,423
You don't
understand, man.

440
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:13,793
So, like you're sitting
on the toilet, right?
Uh-huh.

441
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:16,562
And you're grunting
and you're sweating and

442
00:23:16,629 --> 00:23:21,468
all sorts of just
unspeakable shit is
pouring out of your body.

443
00:23:21,533 --> 00:23:25,370
You're just
grunting and...
(GRUNTING)

444
00:23:25,438 --> 00:23:30,443
Your stomach's churning
and weird shit's going
on inside you.

445
00:23:30,510 --> 00:23:32,479
And then finally,
the churning stops.

446
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:35,047
And there's
this calmness.

447
00:23:36,347 --> 00:23:39,317
And for a moment
you get, like, this
little tickle.

448
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:42,800
And it feels good
for, like, a couple
of seconds.

449
00:23:44,924 --> 00:23:46,425
That's marriage!

450
00:23:46,493 --> 00:23:47,494
Dawg...

451
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:48,894
Ask any married guy.
Right.

452
00:23:50,395 --> 00:23:53,199
Okay. Okay.
How's the wife
and kids, man?

453
00:23:53,264 --> 00:23:54,934
She's all right, man.
She's cool.

454
00:23:55,001 --> 00:23:56,102
But I got lucky.

455
00:23:58,169 --> 00:23:59,448
I'm gonna have
to ask you to leave.

456
00:23:59,472 --> 00:24:00,507
Ritchie!

457
00:24:00,573 --> 00:24:03,242
Francis, what's
up, man?
I got robbed.

458
00:24:03,309 --> 00:24:04,811
What?

459
00:24:04,876 --> 00:24:06,846
Three guys
came in my house.

460
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:08,715
Two white guys

461
00:24:08,781 --> 00:24:10,349
and a black guy.

462
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:12,819
And the black guy was gay.

463
00:24:14,286 --> 00:24:15,688
God bless you.

464
00:24:15,755 --> 00:24:17,624
Oh, this is
my friend, Stu.
Hey.

465
00:24:17,690 --> 00:24:18,890
Francis.
Hey.

466
00:24:18,958 --> 00:24:20,391
What's up?

467
00:24:20,459 --> 00:24:23,195
So, I can't believe
somebody robbed you.
That's crazy.

468
00:24:23,262 --> 00:24:25,307
He got robbed, dude.
By a gay black dude.
They took my money.

469
00:24:25,331 --> 00:24:26,966
They knew
where my safe was.

470
00:24:27,033 --> 00:24:29,273
I don't even know
any gay black dudes.
STU: No, you don't.

471
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:30,703
They knew everything.

472
00:24:30,770 --> 00:24:32,213
RITCHIE: They must not
have known you, man.

473
00:24:32,237 --> 00:24:34,305
Nobody who knows you
would ever mess with you.

474
00:24:34,372 --> 00:24:35,642
I know you.

475
00:24:35,707 --> 00:24:36,976
I don't know you.

476
00:24:37,043 --> 00:24:38,477
You have beautiful eyes.

477
00:24:39,911 --> 00:24:42,081
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I've been drinking.

478
00:24:42,881 --> 00:24:44,551
I gotta see you later.

479
00:24:45,283 --> 00:24:46,451
Come by the house.

480
00:24:47,285 --> 00:24:48,720
Oh, shit!

481
00:24:50,557 --> 00:24:52,191
Holy shit!
(LAUGHING)

482
00:25:03,002 --> 00:25:04,912
All right, this is it.
Don't touch the fence, man.

483
00:25:04,936 --> 00:25:06,471
Unless you want
a permanent Afro.

484
00:25:07,739 --> 00:25:10,509
I'm bald.
It'll grow.

485
00:25:10,577 --> 00:25:12,912
This is it.
Check it out.

486
00:25:12,979 --> 00:25:14,445
That's the warehouse.

487
00:25:14,513 --> 00:25:16,548
Now, I don't know
exactly who they are
but, uh,

488
00:25:16,615 --> 00:25:19,619
I'm guessing
low-rent gottis.

489
00:25:19,686 --> 00:25:21,846
All right, so
we'll come back tonight
and case the spot.

490
00:25:21,888 --> 00:25:23,189
No. No, no can do.

491
00:25:23,255 --> 00:25:24,891
My wife would stretch
my ass all out.

492
00:25:27,326 --> 00:25:28,794
You are such
a hypocrite.
Yeah.

493
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:30,096
You are such
a hypocrite.

494
00:25:30,161 --> 00:25:32,899
Yeah, I got kids, bitch.
I'm not saying I'm happy.

495
00:25:35,702 --> 00:25:38,104
Hey! Micky the Calc.
(CHUCKLING)

496
00:25:38,170 --> 00:25:39,706
Hey, Big Frank.

497
00:25:40,405 --> 00:25:41,540
How are the numbers?

498
00:25:41,608 --> 00:25:43,775
The numbers could've
never been better, man.

499
00:25:43,842 --> 00:25:45,877
Another two weeks,
you're gonna need
a bigger safe.

500
00:25:45,944 --> 00:25:48,080
(LAUGHING) Great.

501
00:25:48,147 --> 00:25:49,181
Hey.

502
00:25:51,416 --> 00:25:53,095
Now, boss, uh,
about the thing
with the thing

503
00:25:53,119 --> 00:25:54,419
with the new batch.

504
00:25:54,485 --> 00:25:56,454
All right, already.
What about the new batch?

505
00:25:56,521 --> 00:25:58,257
Well, there's nothing
wrong with it,

506
00:25:58,324 --> 00:26:01,204
it's just I'm thinking
maybe we should hold off
with the big boys, is all.

507
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:05,496
Bruno, am I
hearing this right?

508
00:26:05,564 --> 00:26:09,668
Carlo here is
telling me that I
gotta scale things down.

509
00:26:09,735 --> 00:26:11,245
Is that what you think,
you little weasel?

510
00:26:11,269 --> 00:26:12,872
We ought to scale
things down?

511
00:26:12,939 --> 00:26:14,339
No disrespect.

512
00:26:14,406 --> 00:26:16,018
It's just that the thing

come back to me.

I could see it
in her eyes.

739
00:36:38,264 --> 00:36:40,332
What you saw
in her eyes was fear.

740
00:36:40,399 --> 00:36:43,735
And that is
usually followed by
a restraining order.

and Kristen go at it,

I'll stop in
mid-fight and
I'll grab a hold of her,

744
00:36:51,877 --> 00:36:53,944
and I'll hold her quietly
until she's calm,

745
00:36:54,011 --> 00:36:57,783
and I'll be like,
"Shh, shh, baby. Shh."

746
00:36:57,849 --> 00:37:00,786
And almost always,
that'll stop the fight.

00:51:12,102 --> 00:51:16,173
I want you to cash
in the 100 grand

1025
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:17,774
that you stole from me!

1026
00:51:18,943 --> 00:51:20,445
I'm sorry, what?

1027
00:51:20,510 --> 00:51:24,348
I want you to meet me
at the, uh, Roadside Diner

1028
00:51:24,414 --> 00:51:26,716
the day after tomorrow
at noon.

1029
00:51:26,783 --> 00:51:29,587
And bring the cash.
You got it?

I need a moment.

1037
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:53,110
I need a moment.
I need a moment.
I need a moment.

1038
00:51:53,178 --> 00:51:54,911
You think maybe
I could use the phone?

1039
00:51:55,479 --> 00:51:57,080
Call my girl?

1040
00:51:57,148 --> 00:52:00,584
Thanks to you assholes,
I missed a date with her.

1041
00:52:00,651 --> 00:52:04,188
Now I gotta lie to
her about why I didn't
show last night.

1042
00:52:04,255 --> 00:52:07,992
Then I gotta put up
with her grillin' me.

1043
00:52:08,057 --> 00:52:10,437
Just tell her you
were in a car accident.
You got the bruises.

1044
00:52:10,461 --> 00:52:12,963
Yeah, I was thinking
car accident, too.

1045
00:52:13,030 --> 00:52:14,231
STU: Right.

1046
00:52:14,298 --> 00:52:15,866
Go for the sympathy.
STU: Right.

1047
00:52:15,933 --> 00:52:18,536
Maybe then she'll stop
riding me about another
big night out.

1048
00:52:19,704 --> 00:52:21,471
She's one of those.

1049
00:52:21,538 --> 00:52:23,407
Of course she's
one of those.
What do you think?

1050
00:52:26,042 --> 00:52:28,345
Why, you got
a ball-buster, too?

1051
00:52:28,412 --> 00:52:30,448
STU: Uh-huh.
That's, uh...

1052
00:52:30,515 --> 00:52:31,781
STU: Uh-huh.

1053
00:52:31,848 --> 00:52:33,150
...putting it mildly.

1054
00:52:33,218 --> 00:52:35,286
STU: Of course
I love you!
Man.

1055
00:52:35,353 --> 00:52:38,723
What guy hasn't
had his life ruined
by some girl?

1056
00:52:38,789 --> 00:52:40,123
Answer me that.

1057
00:52:40,191 --> 00:52:42,327
Baby, this is
some bull... I...

1058
00:52:42,392 --> 00:52:45,363
I can't understand you
when you speak that
Spanish shit to me!

You guys like
the ponies, huh?

1060
00:52:53,704 --> 00:52:56,173
Does the word
"shallow grave" mean
something to you?

1061

Yeah. Yeah.
(CHUCKLES)

1062
00:52:57,842 --> 00:53:00,043
Yeah? Yeah?
I understand
all that.

1063

You understand that?
Yeah.

1064

Hey, you got a racing
card over there?

1065
00:53:04,181 --> 00:53:05,182
Yeah, why?

1066
00:53:05,250 --> 00:53:06,616
Yeah, why?

1067
00:53:06,684 --> 00:53:09,086
You got a horse there
named Hidden Assets
racing?

1068
00:53:09,152 --> 00:53:10,555
Hidden Assets?
Yeah.

1069
00:53:10,620 --> 00:53:11,621
What about him?

1070
00:53:13,357 --> 00:53:16,360
Yeah. He's racing out
of Gate 6 in the 11th.

1071
00:53:19,329 --> 00:53:21,198
You got a bookie?

1072
00:53:21,266 --> 00:53:22,700
You think I might
have a bookie?

1073
00:53:22,767 --> 00:53:25,202
(STAMMERS) I just...
I had a thing.

1074

You got a thing?

He's got a thing!

Hello?

1077
00:53:37,382 --> 00:53:38,548
I gotta leave.

1080
00:53:44,722 --> 00:53:45,790
All right.

1081
00:53:45,856 --> 00:53:46,857
If you gotta go.

1082
00:53:46,924 --> 00:53:48,225
I gotta go.

1083
00:53:48,293 --> 00:53:49,092
All right.
Hey, don't forget.
We gotta move him.

1084
00:53:49,158 --> 00:53:50,395
I know. I know. I know.

1085
00:53:50,460 --> 00:53:51,461
All right.

1086
00:53:53,398 --> 00:53:54,631
What's up with
the Pringles?

1087
00:53:56,566 --> 00:53:58,803
These?
Alex bought 'em.

1088
00:54:00,604 --> 00:54:01,671
For what?

1089
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:04,842
Storage.

1090
00:54:05,409 --> 00:54:07,043
Right, right.

1091
00:54:07,111 --> 00:54:08,313
(BEEPING)
One second, man.

1092
00:54:09,314 --> 00:54:12,082
(SCOFFS) Guess who?
Don't do it.

1093
00:54:12,149 --> 00:54:13,517
Don't do it.
Just don't do it.

1094
00:54:13,584 --> 00:54:14,619
Yeah.

1095
00:54:14,684 --> 00:54:17,521
"Yeah"? Is that how
you answer your phone?

1096
00:54:17,588 --> 00:54:18,788
What do you want?

1097
00:54:19,389 --> 00:54:21,359
What do I want?

1098
00:54:21,426 --> 00:54:24,227
I... Is that how
you talk to me now?

1099
00:54:24,295 --> 00:54:25,796
Can I help you
with something?

00:54:25,863 --> 00:54:27,897
What's the matter?
You busy?

1101
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:31,401
I need to see you.

1102
00:54:33,670 --> 00:54:35,672
I locked myself out
of my apartment.

1103
00:54:36,941 --> 00:54:38,376
Um...

1104
00:54:38,443 --> 00:54:39,877
So, can you come now?

1105
00:54:42,011 --> 00:54:43,146
Okay.

1106
00:54:44,915 --> 00:54:46,015
Good.

1107
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:53,156
(CLEARING THROAT)
Tell me you're
not meeting her.

1108

urgent, man.

00:54:59,629 --> 00:55:01,298
When isn't it urgent?

1111
00:55:01,366 --> 00:55:02,776
I'm just gonna go
see her for a few
minutes, all right?

1112
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:03,300
No big deal.

1113
00:55:03,301 --> 00:55:05,235
You watch him
while I'm gone.

1114
00:55:05,302 --> 00:55:06,679
I'll watch him when
you go see Kristen.

and tell her you'll meet
her on your terms, man.

You got the power.

1118
00:55:12,042 --> 00:55:13,778

for cashing out.

No, as a matter
of fact, he was not.

00:56:55,412 --> 00:56:56,646

The mosquito has
47 teeth. Truth or fib?

Fib.
No, that's
actually true.

have any teeth.

it has to pierce the skin.

01:00:21,050 --> 01:00:22,251
(SOFTLY) Ow!
Hey, um,

1197
01:00:23,854 --> 01:00:25,622
I'm sorry about
that, you know.

1198
01:00:25,690 --> 01:00:27,757
Nah, don't worry
about it. All right?

1199
01:00:27,824 --> 01:00:30,294
I know you guys are
in a bit of a bind here.

1200
01:00:30,360 --> 01:00:33,596
It's clear you've
never done anything
like this before.

1201
01:00:33,664 --> 01:00:36,667
Yeah.
And you know what?

1202
01:00:36,734 --> 01:00:39,336
You didn't enjoy
hitting me when
you could have.

1203
01:00:39,403 --> 01:00:40,905
And you know what else?

1204
01:00:40,970 --> 01:00:43,273
I got a lot of respect
for the two of you

1205
01:00:43,340 --> 01:00:47,277
for sticking together
and waiting to make this
exchange to get your boy out.

1206
01:00:49,112 --> 01:00:50,848
That's a big deal.

1207
01:00:50,915 --> 01:00:53,350
You know, I ain't got
anybody like that in my life.

1208
01:00:53,417 --> 01:00:55,419
Real friends.

1209
01:00:55,484 --> 01:00:57,922
You know what?
Let me give you
a piece of advice.

1210
01:01:00,925 --> 01:01:03,660
When you guys go
in there to make this
deal with my uncle,

1211
01:01:05,428 --> 01:01:06,696
don't wear the pink dress.

1212
01:01:08,597 --> 01:01:13,937
Hey! If he senses
the tiniest little bit
of fear out of you,

1213
01:01:14,004 --> 01:01:16,006
you guys ain't gonna
see your buddy again.

1214
01:01:16,073 --> 01:01:17,707
I'm not shitting you.
Oh, man.

1215
01:01:17,774 --> 01:01:20,109
You gotta think about

1216
01:01:20,177 --> 01:01:24,580
the most pissed-off
your girl ever made you.

1217
01:01:24,647 --> 01:01:27,684
No. Think about
walking in on her

1218
01:01:27,752 --> 01:01:28,786
(PUNCHING HIS HAND)

1219
01:01:28,853 --> 01:01:31,355
banging this new guy.

1220
01:01:31,421 --> 01:01:33,690
You think about that,
and you go in there

1221
01:01:33,758 --> 01:01:36,326
and you put on
the biggest tough-guy
act you can.

1222
01:01:36,393 --> 01:01:38,027
Okay.
Let me see your
tough-guy face.

1223
01:01:38,763 --> 01:01:40,429
What?

1224
01:01:40,496 --> 01:01:41,698
Your tough-guy face.

1225
01:01:43,166 --> 01:01:44,301
All right. Uh...

1226
01:01:48,238 --> 01:01:50,073
(EXHALES)

1227
01:01:50,139 --> 01:01:51,275
No, like this.

1228
01:01:53,277 --> 01:01:54,610
Oh, okay.

1229
01:01:54,677 --> 01:01:56,445
Okay, now give me
a grunt with it.

1230
01:01:57,314 --> 01:01:58,315
Okay.

1231
01:02:00,149 --> 01:02:02,486

What, are you trying
to scare a bunch
of Girl Scouts?

1234
01:02:06,122 --> 01:02:07,691
Come on!

1235
01:02:07,758 --> 01:02:09,025
Watch and learn.

1236
01:02:12,729 --> 01:02:14,864
(GRUNTING)

1237
01:02:14,931 --> 01:02:16,533
Oh, that's good.

1238
01:02:16,600 --> 01:02:18,202
Now do it.
Okay, okay. Um...

1239
01:02:19,904 --> 01:02:22,171
(GRUNTING)

1240
01:02:24,173 --> 01:02:25,985
That's good.
It's a little pussy,
but I like it.

1241
01:02:26,009 --> 01:02:28,878
(LAUGHS)
All right.

1242
01:02:28,945 --> 01:02:30,155
(ROMANTIC MUSIC PLAYING)
How are you feeling?

1243
01:02:30,179 --> 01:02:33,617
I'm so good right now.
I'm so good.

1244
01:02:33,682 --> 01:02:35,886
Are you sure?
Yes.

1245
01:02:35,953 --> 01:02:37,553
Tell me
it's gonna be okay.

1246
01:02:38,687 --> 01:02:40,457
It's gonna be okay.

1247
01:02:47,464 --> 01:02:49,333
You don't have to...
It's gonna be okay.

1248
01:02:50,968 --> 01:02:52,369
It's gonna be okay.

1249
01:02:52,436 --> 01:02:54,070
Uh-huh.

1250
01:02:54,137 --> 01:02:55,704
Mmm.

1251
01:02:55,772 --> 01:02:57,942
I love you.
I love you, too.

1252
01:02:59,276 --> 01:03:00,743
(FESTIVE MUSIC PLAYING)

Oh! Whoa! Whoo!

01:03:05,749 --> 01:03:06,917
Oh!
Ah!

(LAUGHING)

1256
01:03:09,553 --> 01:03:11,621
Give me a hard eight!
(LAUGHS)

1257

A little Viagra, too.

1258
01:03:12,857 --> 01:03:15,992
And some K-Y.
(LAUGHS)

1259
01:03:16,059 --> 01:03:19,196

Mama needs new shoes.

Whoo!

(PHONE RINGING)
Oh.

1264
01:03:28,004 --> 01:03:29,606
Hello?

1265
01:03:29,673 --> 01:03:32,051
Carmen, what's going on?
You were supposed to call me
an hour ago.

1266
01:03:32,075 --> 01:03:33,076
Oh, Eric.

1267
01:03:33,142 --> 01:03:34,879
Darling,
is that you?

1268
01:03:34,944 --> 01:03:37,246
Oh, uh,
I can hardly
hear you, honey.

1269
01:03:37,314 --> 01:03:39,950
How is our little operation
coming along?

1270
01:03:40,017 --> 01:03:43,786
Oh! Fan-friggin'-tastic.
(LAUGHS)

1271
01:03:43,854 --> 01:03:45,455
I just hit eight
the hard way

1272
01:03:45,522 --> 01:03:47,324
and I'm doubling up
behind the line.

1273
01:03:47,391 --> 01:03:48,993
No, no, no, no!
You're gambling?

1274
01:03:49,058 --> 01:03:51,260
Oh, listen, Eric,
I gotta go.

1275
01:03:51,328 --> 01:03:53,138
I'll have a friend
bring you the cash
in the morning.

1276
01:03:53,162 --> 01:03:54,563
Wait, what?

1277
01:03:54,630 --> 01:03:56,500
I'll hit ya later,
okay, sweetheart?
Bye.

1278
01:03:56,565 --> 01:03:58,602
No! Carmen?

1279
01:03:58,667 --> 01:04:00,370
Okay. Kiss 'em, baby.

(KISSING NOISES)

1281
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:06,009
You wanna
get out of here?

1282
01:04:12,716 --> 01:04:16,552
No, no, there's
a huge difference between
courtship and relationship.

1283
01:04:16,619 --> 01:04:18,188
Yeah.

1284
01:04:18,255 --> 01:04:21,591
When you're courting,
she's the only thing
you can think about. Right?

1285
01:04:21,658 --> 01:04:23,928
Uh-huh.
I mean, you jump
through any hoop,

1286
01:04:23,993 --> 01:04:26,230
you blow off
your friends,

1287
01:04:26,295 --> 01:04:32,135
you pretend to like stuff
that you would never like.
Opera, poetry, flowers

1288
01:04:32,201 --> 01:04:34,038
and French
and shit like that.

1289
01:04:34,104 --> 01:04:35,539
Yeah, I know.

1290
01:04:35,605 --> 01:04:38,375
But when you start
getting it steady,

1291
01:04:38,442 --> 01:04:39,944
then all of a sudden
something snaps

1292
01:04:40,010 --> 01:04:41,878
and you don't want it
at all anymore.

1293
01:04:41,946 --> 01:04:43,880
She's trying to get
all frisky on you,

1294
01:04:43,948 --> 01:04:48,085
and you'd rather be
watching some
college basketball game

1295
01:04:48,152 --> 01:04:50,887
between two schools
you ain't even
heard of before.

1296
01:04:50,955 --> 01:04:53,657
Yeah. That's true.
So, what school
do you guys go to?

1297
01:04:53,722 --> 01:04:55,624
School?

1298
01:04:55,691 --> 01:04:58,095
Yeah. Listen,
we're not interested,
you little trollops.

Ooh. The one behind them
is checking you out, though.

Hey, let me
ask you something.

01:05:05,168 --> 01:05:06,470
Hmm?

1303
01:05:06,536 --> 01:05:09,372
What do you tell a girl
when she asks you what you do?

1304
01:05:09,439 --> 01:05:12,142
I mix it up.
As long as it
sounds professional.

1305
01:05:13,509 --> 01:05:14,711
Yeah.

1306
01:05:14,778 --> 01:05:18,315
Hmm. She is
checking you out.

1307
01:05:18,382 --> 01:05:21,750
(WHISPERING) Oh,
she's... Here she
comes. She's comin'.

Uh, Angie, would you
like to, uh, sit down?

No. I'm okay.

1314

You write in it?

So, um, how'd you guys
do that day?

1319
01:05:55,184 --> 01:05:57,621
Well, my buddy
hit a long shot
named Hidden Asset.

1320
01:05:58,522 --> 01:05:59,990
You bet on that horse?

1321
01:06:00,057 --> 01:06:01,491
Yeah, why?

1322
01:06:01,558 --> 01:06:02,758
That was
our first win.

1323
01:06:03,826 --> 01:06:05,161
Are you a gambler?

1324
01:06:05,228 --> 01:06:06,930
She's one of
my father's horses.

1325
01:06:06,996 --> 01:06:09,233
Oh. Daddy has horses.

1326
01:06:10,199 --> 01:06:13,169
So, what do you do?

1327
01:06:13,236 --> 01:06:15,705
Oh, uh, uh, my man here is
a professional, uh...

01:06:27,584 --> 01:06:28,652
Really?

1333
01:06:28,718 --> 01:06:29,853
Really?

1334
01:06:29,918 --> 01:06:31,355
Really.

1335
01:06:39,795 --> 01:06:42,199
So, uh, did you ever
write in that diary?

1336
01:06:43,633 --> 01:06:45,468
Not yet.

1337
01:06:45,535 --> 01:06:48,437
You will.
You just need
to be inspired.

BRUNO: Speaking
of inspiration,

1339
01:06:52,142 --> 01:06:53,610
I'll just leave
you guys here.

Okay.

1341
01:06:56,845 --> 01:06:58,515
So, Eric.

01:06:58,582 --> 01:07:00,749

to being over her.

an asshole.

01:10:01,163 --> 01:10:03,131
He thought he was
a cool asshole,
you know?

right there.

just left me.

to be careful

No.

the middle name.

"Mutombo."

01:28:49,825 --> 01:28:51,292
That's it, man. I'm done.

1710
01:28:53,661 --> 01:28:55,296
You all right,
beautiful?

1711
01:28:55,931 --> 01:28:57,264
I am now.

1712
01:28:57,833 --> 01:28:59,266
All right.

1713
01:29:01,003 --> 01:29:03,105
That was a
nice car, too.

1714
01:29:19,787 --> 01:29:22,990
ERIC: All right, diary.
I'm inspired.

1715
01:29:24,960 --> 01:29:28,830
Well, the last couple of days
sure have been eye-opening.

1716
01:29:28,897 --> 01:29:31,967
I got myself into
some serious shit.

1717
01:29:32,034 --> 01:29:35,170
And I nearly got me
and my best friends
killed in the process.

1718
01:29:36,838 --> 01:29:38,040
And for what?

1719
01:29:39,674 --> 01:29:40,943
To fall out of love.

1720
01:29:45,747 --> 01:29:47,650
So this is your
big Tuesday secret?

1721
01:29:47,715 --> 01:29:49,851
This is
absolutely insane.

1722
01:29:50,718 --> 01:29:53,388
And absolutely awesome.

1723
01:29:53,456 --> 01:29:55,823
I don't know
about this, man.
I thought we gave this up.

1724
01:29:56,858 --> 01:29:59,360
He just wants
a little cut.

1725
01:29:59,428 --> 01:30:01,430
You really
trust this guy, huh?

1726
01:30:02,965 --> 01:30:04,967
I don't know.
We had some
weird connection.

1727
01:30:07,603 --> 01:30:10,973
Okay. That's...
(RELUCTANTLY)
All right.

1728
01:30:18,613 --> 01:30:19,715
Yeah.

1729
01:30:23,117 --> 01:30:24,752
(EXCLAIMING IN ANGER)

1730
01:30:26,353 --> 01:30:27,656
(SHOUTING ANGRILY)

1731
01:30:27,723 --> 01:30:28,724
(GASPING)

1732
01:30:31,058 --> 01:30:32,294
(GROANING)

1733
01:30:34,663 --> 01:30:37,099
(THUDDING)

1734
01:30:37,165 --> 01:30:40,936
ERIC: My buddy Zen master
told my buddy, who told me,

1735
01:30:41,003 --> 01:30:43,138
"You get
what you resist."

1736
01:30:43,205 --> 01:30:44,238
(MAN MOANING)
Oh!

1737
01:30:44,305 --> 01:30:47,209
Oh, right there.

1738
01:30:47,274 --> 01:30:49,744
Oh, yeah.
Oh, you like that, baby,
don't ya?

1739
01:30:49,811 --> 01:30:50,989
(INSINCERELY)
It's my favorite.

1740
01:30:51,013 --> 01:30:52,413
That Zen shit,

1741
01:30:53,280 --> 01:30:55,484
it's for real.

1742
01:30:55,551 --> 01:30:57,351
I'm a believer.

1743
01:31:05,460 --> 01:31:10,232
"My buddy Zen master
told my buddy, who told me,"

1744
01:31:11,333 --> 01:31:13,301
"'You get what you resist.'"

1745
01:31:13,368 --> 01:31:15,337
"That Zen shit's for real.
I'm a believer."

1746
01:31:22,545 --> 01:31:24,012
What are you readin'?

1747
01:31:26,849 --> 01:31:29,383
TARA: (READING) "So now
if anyone ever asks me",

1748
01:31:29,450 --> 01:31:32,354
"I remember my exact moment
that I lost that feeling"

1749
01:31:32,419 --> 01:31:33,856
"was when I stood
under my"

1750
01:31:34,922 --> 01:31:36,190
"ex's window"

1751
01:31:36,257 --> 01:31:37,725
"and heard her
lying to me..."

1752
01:31:41,228 --> 01:31:43,566
"...and heard her
lying to me,"

1753
01:31:43,632 --> 01:31:46,535
"over and over
in a rhythmic climax."

1754
01:31:46,602 --> 01:31:48,070
"And for what?"

1755
01:31:48,771 --> 01:31:50,539
"To fall out of love."

1756
01:32:29,912 --> 01:32:31,279
Thinking about
getting married.

1757
01:32:31,346 --> 01:32:32,615
What the fuck...
Yes.

1758
01:32:32,680 --> 01:32:33,849
...are you
talking about?

1759
01:32:33,916 --> 01:32:35,026
I'm thinking about,
I'm gonna do it.

1760
01:32:35,050 --> 01:32:36,719
Why?
Because.

1761
01:32:36,785 --> 01:32:40,623
What... Look at me!
Prison! No! Don't do it.

1762
01:32:40,689 --> 01:32:42,523
I've gotta do it.
You don't have to do it!

1763
01:32:42,591 --> 01:32:43,692
I love her.

1764
01:32:43,759 --> 01:32:45,260
So, what does that
even mean?

1765
01:32:45,327 --> 01:32:47,962
What does that mean,
you love her?
What does that mean?

1766
01:32:48,029 --> 01:32:50,565
It means that
I have invested a lot
of my time into...

1767
01:32:50,633 --> 01:32:52,644
So you wanna go
into a legal contract
with the state?

1768
01:32:52,668 --> 01:32:56,037
That's all it is.
It's a tribal ritual.

1769
01:32:56,104 --> 01:32:57,840
It's been around
for thousands of years.

1770
01:32:57,905 --> 01:33:00,407
And idiots just do it
because everybody
before them did it.

1771
01:33:00,474 --> 01:33:02,476
And the only reason
why guys get married
at all

1772
01:33:02,543 --> 01:33:05,579
is 'cause the idea
of some other dude
gorilla-fucking your woman

1773
01:33:05,580 --> 01:33:07,950
is just too much
for you to handle.

1774
01:33:08,015 --> 01:33:10,685
It's insecurity.
That's what it is.

1775
01:33:10,752 --> 01:33:12,087
It's weak shit.

1776
01:33:12,154 --> 01:33:15,457
I'm guilty as charged.
Trust me.
Don't do it.

1777
01:33:15,522 --> 01:33:16,925
You don't
need to do it.

1778
01:33:16,992 --> 01:33:19,126
But it's a good...
Look, it's an institution.

1779
01:33:19,193 --> 01:33:20,527
Marriage is
an institution...

1780
01:33:20,595 --> 01:33:22,864
What? So is the KKK!
What does that mean?

1781
01:33:22,930 --> 01:33:24,365
Everything's
an institution.

1782
01:33:24,431 --> 01:33:27,970
It's a legal contract
with the state
in a relationship.

1783
01:33:28,035 --> 01:33:30,906
How the fuck can you say
"till death do you part"?

1784
01:33:30,973 --> 01:33:32,415
And it's not
"till death do you part"
anyway.

1785
01:33:32,439 --> 01:33:34,777
There's like 65 percent
divorce rate.

1786
01:33:36,111 --> 01:33:37,845
You've thought
about this a lot,
I see.

1787
01:33:37,912 --> 01:33:40,848
Yeah! Yeah.
You lose
all your shit, dude.

1788
01:33:40,915 --> 01:33:43,017
You gotta pay lawyers.
And it's not even half.

1789
01:33:43,084 --> 01:33:44,418
It's two-thirds.

1790
01:33:44,485 --> 01:33:46,087
'Cause the freakin'
lawyer gets a third.

1791
01:33:46,154 --> 01:33:47,965
It's all good, though.
Listen, I'm not trying
to get divorced.

1792
01:33:47,989 --> 01:33:49,324
I'm gonna be
married forever, man.

1793
01:33:49,391 --> 01:33:51,993
What the fuck
are you talking about,
fantasy boy?

1794
01:33:52,059 --> 01:33:53,304
I'm talking
about reality
right now.

1795
01:33:53,328 --> 01:33:55,496
You're talking fuckin'
green eggs and ham!

1796
01:33:55,562 --> 01:33:56,875
Dawg, all I was
trying to tell you

1797
01:33:56,899 --> 01:33:58,408
is that I was
thinking about
getting married.

1798
01:33:58,432 --> 01:34:00,144
And I'm telling you,
as a guy who's fucked...

1799
01:34:00,168 --> 01:34:02,137
I'm fucked.
You know why I stay?

1800
01:34:02,204 --> 01:34:04,005
Because I can't afford
a freakin' lawyer.

1801
01:34:04,071 --> 01:34:05,439
And I like my kids.

1802
01:34:05,506 --> 01:34:06,817
But you're...
I'm saying,
you got beautiful kids.

1803
01:34:06,841 --> 01:34:08,243
What the fuck
does that matter?

1804
01:34:08,309 --> 01:34:10,655
I gotta check in
with my wife every time
I wanna go anywhere.

1805
01:34:10,679 --> 01:34:12,390
We're at the strip club
right now, partying!

1806
01:34:12,414 --> 01:34:15,582
Yeah... No! No, no, no!
We're at Sam's house
playing cards!

1807
01:34:15,650 --> 01:34:18,686
And I gotta step outside
in 20 minutes
and make fake phone call.

1808
01:34:18,753 --> 01:34:20,187
It's all good.
You think that's fun?

1809
01:34:20,254 --> 01:34:21,288
That is fun.
That's the...

1810
01:34:21,355 --> 01:34:23,225
You wanna have someone
like your mommy

1811
01:34:23,290 --> 01:34:24,727
who you gotta
check in with?

1812
01:34:25,559 --> 01:34:26,928
(WHISTLES)

1813
01:34:26,994 --> 01:34:28,506
You should really
think about why
you got married.

1814
01:34:28,530 --> 01:34:30,532
I thought when
you got married
it's for the...

1815
01:34:30,597 --> 01:34:31,967
It's the...
Look, I love my kids.

1816
01:34:32,034 --> 01:34:34,068
I love my kids.
Your kids are great.

1817
01:34:34,135 --> 01:34:35,278
It's just been awhile
since I seen 'em.

1818
01:34:35,302 --> 01:34:36,380
It's been awhile
since I seen 'em.

1819
01:34:36,404 --> 01:34:37,480
I got lucky.
My wife's not that bad.

1820
01:34:37,504 --> 01:34:38,807
It could be worse.
She's great.

1821
01:34:38,874 --> 01:34:40,251
She's great.
It's been awhile
since I seen her.

1822
01:34:40,275 --> 01:34:41,820
You don't have to do it.
I can do it, though.

1823
01:34:41,844 --> 01:34:43,044
No, you can stay out.

1824
01:34:43,110 --> 01:34:44,587
Why don't you come by
for a barbecue next week?

1825
01:34:44,611 --> 01:34:46,749
Why don't you
think about it
for a couple of years?

1826
01:34:46,815 --> 01:34:48,283
Your girl's Latin.

1827
01:34:48,350 --> 01:34:49,427
What's up, dude?
I don't know.

1828
01:34:49,451 --> 01:34:50,918
How many babies
you want, 50?

1829
01:34:50,985 --> 01:34:52,225
I just want two.
Yeah, whatever.

1830
01:34:52,287 --> 01:34:54,521
Boy and a girl.
Two? Two will be
in the first week.

1831
01:34:54,588 --> 01:34:56,133
You know,
they're only pregnant for,
like, three months.

1832
01:34:56,157 --> 01:34:57,634
They're like a Rottweiler.
Get the fuck
out of here!

1833
01:34:57,658 --> 01:34:59,828
They shoot babies out.
Ay, ay, ay!

1834
01:34:59,895 --> 01:35:01,329
Get the fuck out.

1835
01:35:01,396 --> 01:35:03,106
If she heard you
talking like this,
she'd kick your ass.

1836
01:35:03,130 --> 01:35:04,743
I hope you like kids.
You're gonna be
stepping on little pinatas

1837
01:35:04,767 --> 01:35:05,700
all around
your fuckin' house.
Oh. (LAUGHS)

1838
01:35:05,701 --> 01:35:07,969
Come on, man.
Having babies.
