00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:25,639
<i>RED SHOE DIARIES
WILD ORCHID III</i>

2
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:37,770
The lord is my Shepard,
i shall not want.

3
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:40,870
He makes me to lie down in green pastures,

4
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:44,000
and leaves me beside the still waters.

5
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:46,870
He restores my soul.

6
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:50,870
He leads me in the paths of
righteousness for his namesake.

7
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,870
Yea though i walk through the valley
of the shadow of death

8
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:58,670
i will fear no evil, for you
are with me.

9
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,885
Your miracles will be performed in
the presence of my enemies,

10
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,985
you anoint my head with oil.
My cup runs over.

11
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:13,119
I'm sorry, Jack.
It's terrible.

12
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:18,519
All the day of my life, i was well
in the house of the lord.

13
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:28,350
I'm so sorry, Jake.

14
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:42,150
I'm really sorry about Alex.
We'll all miss her.

15
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:57,839
When you work up the courage
to talk about this,

16
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:00,839
you know where to find me.

17
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:07,070
Got it all cleaned up, Mr. Jack.

18
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:14,038
I'm sorry.
I couldn't take the cementery.

19
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:18,992
I don't undersatnd. She was so...

20
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:22,050
She was so much to live for.

21
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:11,316
Hi, we're not in right now.
Work, work, work.

22
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:14,029
Leave us a mesage.

23
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:25,558
Jake? It's Marlene.

24
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,558
So,could i take you out to dinner tonight?
And maybe just talk.

25
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:38,468
I just don't think you should be alone.

26
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:41,858
So, call me, all right?
Okay, bye.

27
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:11,110
Friday, July 12.

28
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:19,000
Too excited. Too much energy,

29
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,471
Took off from work early.

30
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:52,715
6 months and he's already a part
of my every breath,

31
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,795
my every thought. He's everything
i ever dreamed of.

32
00:07:55,880 --> 00:08:03,217
A fairy tale Prince. If an hour
goes by without hearing his voice,

33
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:06,914
i'm lost. Adrift.
I've surrendered to his taste,

34
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:10,859
to his place, to his every wish.

35
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:14,230
He knows me inside out,
everything about me.

36
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:22,968
My troubles with my mother, the
abortion i had when i was 18,

37
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:27,430
my fear of the dark,
my fascination with fire.

38
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:13,152
No, Jack. There's people there.
No, Jake, the wedding.

39
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:17,391
- I don't care.
- No.

40
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:18,932
Yes.

41
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,509
No... okay... Maybe.

42
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:28,434
I've given him every memory of the past,

43
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:33,593
every dream of the future.

44
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,294
I've thrown all my card on
the table before him.

45
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:39,071
I'm an open book.

46
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:44,554
I want my mystery back.
Something. Anything.

47
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:48,930
One thought, one deed, one tiny
secret that's mine alone.

48
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:57,430
I don't understand.

49
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:00,053
Look at this, Paul.
When the sun rises,

50
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:02,750
it's gonna hit the buidings
and create shadows

51
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:06,500
for the people on the parks
down on the ground.

52
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:09,714
- It's gorgeus. - Who gives a shit
how the light hits down there?

53
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:14,800
- Nobody see it this way. Helicopter
pilots, maybe. - And angels.

54
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:17,756
Jesus Christ, Jake, not that
angel bullshit again.

55
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:21,796
No, look, just unclench.
Enjoy the sunset.

56
00:10:21,806 --> 00:10:25,070
Think about how the angels are
gonna love this sunset. Look.

57
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:29,300
July 15th. Another 14-hour day.

58
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:34,500
We are both equally compulsive.
Equally dedicated to our work.

59
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:39,656
The difference is i change the look
of people's living rooms,

60
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:42,680
- the fabric of the couches.
- Bye, cutie!

61
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:45,656
Jake changes the skyline.

62
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:51,656
His buildings will affect the way
people live for yhe next 100 years.

63
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:55,356
Not much of a comparison when
you really think about it.

64
00:10:57,820 --> 00:11:01,791
Do you know how lucky you are to
enjoy your work as much as you do?

65
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:09,870
And to be as good as you are.
And to be rewarded for it?

66
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:15,332
I envy that. I really do.

67
00:11:21,552 --> 00:11:23,277
I've always had this thought

68
00:11:23,352 --> 00:11:26,577
that maybe God put certain people
on this earth

69
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:29,277
to take care of us.

70
00:11:29,302 --> 00:11:34,200
Doctors, poets, musicians.

71
00:11:35,752 --> 00:11:37,577
People with vision.

72
00:11:40,552 --> 00:11:42,577
People like you.

73
00:11:47,352 --> 00:11:48,877
Come here.

74
00:11:53,652 --> 00:11:55,277
Just stand right here.

75
00:11:58,652 --> 00:12:00,777
- Take off your sweater.
- Why?

76
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:07,871
I wanna see the outline of your body
through your nightgown.

77
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:20,871
I love the way look.

78
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:23,271
I love the way you smell.

79
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:27,671
I love the way you taste.

80
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:31,771
I love the way you feel.

81
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:34,871
I love the way you smile.

82
00:12:34,930 --> 00:12:37,471
I love the way you scratch me.

83
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:39,871
I love thew way you moan.

84
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:43,255
I love the way you come.

85
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:47,271
I love everything.
I love it.

86
00:12:47,306 --> 00:12:50,555
- Don't say that.
- I love you.

87
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:15,550
O... T... A...

88
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:19,250
- L... Z... F?
- No, don't move.

89
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:26,500
August 8th.
Got my eyes checked today.

90
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:33,690
Try not to blink. You've got something
imbedded in your iris.

91
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:36,650
Looks like a little chunk of glass.

92
00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:40,350
Have you felt any irritation?
No, please.

93
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:43,971
It'd be better for both of us
if you didn't move.

94
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:49,600
If this ruptured, it could cause you
serious trouble.

95
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:55,470
I read that 70 to 80% of all
the people in the world give up,

96
00:14:55,875 --> 00:14:57,680
stop growing, stop dreaming,

97
00:14:57,700 --> 00:15:00,000
and settle down the time
they are twenty-two,

98
00:15:00,010 --> 00:15:03,854
become an eye-doctor and make
your mother happy,

99
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:06,470
nice and safe.

100
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:13,100
Don't move a muscle.

101
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:25,671
I could barely walk straight.
No perspective.

102
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:28,785
I should have called Jake, but

103
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:31,885
i sort of enjoy the adventure.

104
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:36,273
I hope you hit that son of a bitch back!

105
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:40,457
Amaizing. Every passing stranger
assumed I was a victim.

106
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:42,500
That I had been beaten by my man.

107
00:15:42,510 --> 00:15:47,000
Don't let'em get away with it.
Get out.

108
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:01,831
You okay?

109
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:03,950
Crazy drivers.

110
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:11,600
- You get something in you eye?
- A piece of glass.?

111
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:16,200
It happens. Accidents.

112
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:19,500
You put in all this time and energy
planning for your future,

113
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:22,500
and bam! Acar runs you down
on the street

114
00:16:22,510 --> 00:16:26,800
or bullet hits you by mistake.

115
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:29,656
- That sucks.
- Yeah,that sucks.

116
00:16:29,710 --> 00:16:35,155
Nothing would piss me off more than that.
I think about it a lot.

117
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:42,916
- Goodbye dreams. Lights go out.
- That's all she wrote.

118
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:49,872
You just never know,
know what i mean.

119
00:16:49,950 --> 00:16:52,733
I know what you mean.

120
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:56,658
It was just a piece of glass.

121
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:01,950
Take it easy.

122
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:33,225
Perfect teeth, perfect skin,

123
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:38,125
perfect chest, perfect hair,

124
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:41,225
I just fell into his arms.

125
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:46,708
The wind just sort of blew me his way.

126
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:51,516
Perfect.

127
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:35,200
August 12th. Got the bandages
taken off my eye today.

128
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:39,534
Just happened to end up on
the same corner.

129
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:47,749
A little childish, a little
narcissistic maybe.

130
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:53,525
the perfect contender in a battle
tha's already been won.

131
00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:01,825
Someone so different from Jake,
there's no contest, no conflict,

132
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,000
no competition, no confusion.

133
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:10,791
THE PERFECT SECRET.

134
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:20,800
<i>Lady's shoe outlet</i>

135
00:20:56,440 --> 00:21:02,470
- I know you, don't I?
- I don't think so.

136
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:08,198
- You looking for shoes?
- I'm always looking for shoes.

137
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:11,337
Come on in. Have a look.

138
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:16,233
I got something just for you.

139
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:27,712
Have a seet.

140
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:32,874
- Aren't you gonna ask me my size?
- Seven and a half B.

141
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:43,636
Yep. Seven and a half B.
Batia La Page.

142
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:46,631
- La Page.
- Who is she?

143
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:48,356
A woman in France.

144
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:50,779
- Did you buy there?
- Yes.

145
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:53,850
- How much?
- I don't remember.

146
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,895
Come on, how much?

147
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,300
- About two hundred dollars.
- Two hundred dollars?

148
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:03,910
These are American.
Kenneth Cole, my main man.

149
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,910
And they are much prettier.

150
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:14,000
Stand up, walk around, let me
see what they look like.

151
00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:21,351
Beautiful.

152
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:25,531
They make you look like a Princess.

153
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:30,152
- You like them?
- Yes.

154
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,750
You know, I'm glad to see you
got that bandage off your eye.

155
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:41,300
- Can you see better?
- Obviously not well enough.

156
00:22:41,450 --> 00:22:43,650
- I didn't recognize you in this store.
- I work two jobs.

157
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:45,850
I see.

158
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:52,511
- You know when the weather main broke the other day?
- It was funny.

159
00:22:52,550 --> 00:22:57,671
It felt good, didn't it?
You like the way this feels?

160
00:22:57,860 --> 00:23:03,671
Being close like this.
Answer me.

161
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:05,500
Yes.

162
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:11,270
There's no rational explanation for
the attraction between two people.

163
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:15,331
It just sort of happens,
like accidents.

164
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,516
It has to do with magic.

165
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:22,300
- Magic.
- Alchemy. Chemistry.

166
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:27,516
Electromagnetic vibratory
transmission forces.

167
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,650
The stuff that moved the blocks
for the pyramids.

168
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:36,612
Right now,

169
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:40,612
I could balance one of those blocks
on the front of my pants.

170
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:46,131
- Really?
- Yeah, have a look.

171
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,200
See what you see.

172
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:59,150
Ladies, I'll be right with you.

173
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:04,000
- Six double A, nine B. Am I right?
- Amazing.

174
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,000
So...

175
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:19,574
- Will this be cash or credit card?
- Credit card.

176
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:28,100
That is where i live.
Meet me tomorrow night.

177
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:31,450
Eight o'clock.

178
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:38,548
Thank you.

179
00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:42,596
Step on a crack and break
your mother's back.

180
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:47,500
When I was a kid I dared myself
to do the most outrageous things.

181
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:54,450
I'd get right up to the edge,
and inevitably...

182
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:59,900
inevitably, i'd find an
excuse to tail out.

183
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:04,000
How many hours a day do you
spend in this thing?

184
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:08,700
Never enough. I lie back.

185
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:14,400
Close my eyes. I feel
nothing but warm darkness.

186
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:20,751
And I float up, up. Free.

187
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:25,570
You're one of those
Victorian mystery boxes.

188
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:31,631
You open one and there's another.

189
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:40,031
And you open that one and
there's another inside that.

190
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:45,772
Just when you think you've think
you've opened the last box,

191
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:51,072
there's another, always another.

192
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:59,830
- Jake?
- Yeah, baby, what?

193
00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:02,868
Let's take tomorrow off.

194
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:09,439
Let's take a long ride
out to Santa Barbara,

195
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:15,035
stay in some seedy motel.

196
00:26:18,765 --> 00:26:21,995
- Ican't.
- Why not?

197
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:26,931
I've got to duke it out with Paul
and the big boys over dinner.

198
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:33,256
- Do it another night.
- I can't baby.

199
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:39,959
Please.

200
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:41,997
I can't.

201
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:13,305
When the light's just
right like this,

202
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:17,470
it's as if the ship is
actually out on the sea,

203
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:19,714
somwhere in Mediterranean...

204
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:25,516
I can see the passengers,

205
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:28,816
men in their tuxedos and
the women in their gowns.

206
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:31,309
That on there is drunk.

207
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:35,714
You see, see the woman over
there in the feather boa?

208
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:39,691
- In the purple hat?
- Yeah, screaming at the captain.

209
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:42,638
- Yeah
- It's my mother.

210
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:47,516
- He just threw her off.
- As to be so lucky.

211
00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:24,351
Come on, sweetheart, talk to me.

212
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:29,331
Stop me from going.

213
00:29:30,380 --> 00:29:34,191
Filled with fire, burning with shame,

214
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:38,629
I kept telling myself over and over

215
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:42,928
that I'd never go through with it.
No way..

216
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,868
Are you going to a party, Mrs. Alex?

217
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:48,376
- A meeting.
- You look gorgeous.

218
00:29:48,380 --> 00:29:51,619
- Of course you always look gourgeous.
- Thank you.

219
00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:55,351
Are you okay?

220
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:08,631
My world was falling apart with each step,

221
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:11,149
but that didn't stop me.

222
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:18,571
I had to see Jake. I was sure that
he'd rush up to me,

223
00:30:18,606 --> 00:30:20,198
hold me, stop me.

224
00:30:20,950 --> 00:30:25,298
- 24 hours! If the shipment is not here...
- He didn't even see me.

225
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:30,300
- I will see your ass in court.
- Will you excuse us for a minute?

226
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:33,849
Be careful, Jake. This guy can
kill us, he will kill us.

227
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:37,159
If you show any weakness they'll
eat you for breakfast.

228
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:39,890
Trust me. Okay?.

229
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:44,372
Mitch, don't you dare fucking
stonewall me, okay?

230
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:48,349
I'm sick of your excuses
and I'm tired of you.

231
00:30:51,080 --> 00:31:55,796
To know what you want and
to go after it and get it,

232
00:30:55,989 --> 00:30:59,831
and to actually belive you deserve it,

233
00:31:01,885 --> 00:31:03,866
my God, how envy Jake for that.

234
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:06,590
I told myself for the hundreth time: RUN!

235
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:40,671
I don't know what i'm doing here.

236
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:44,635
I told you I could move blocks
with my cock.

237
00:32:46,750 --> 00:32:50,753
Your curiosity was piqued.
Now here you are.

238
00:32:55,180 --> 00:32:58,189
Why don't you take off your clothes?

239
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:01,154
- I...
- What?

240
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:05,791
I just suddenly realize I don't know you.

241
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:08,217
I don't even know your name.

242
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:10,920
You're no stranger to me.

243
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:15,011
I know everything I need to know.

244
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:20,310
- You don't know anything about me.
- Sure I do.

245
00:33:20,420 --> 00:33:22,673
I know you're beautiful.

246
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:27,291
You wear two hundreatd dollar shoes,

247
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:31,451
and you are with someone who
doesn't make you happy.

248
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:33,860
He does.

249
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:38,574
He makes me too happy, that's the problem.

250
00:33:39,860 --> 00:33:41,750
Seriously.

251
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:44,451
Have you ever noticed how liars
start each sentence

252
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:46,850
with: "To tell the thruth"?

253
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:50,250
You keep saying "No, seriously".

254
00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:54,371
It makes me think that you're
just fooling around.

255
00:33:54,940 --> 00:33:56,951
Are You?

256
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:59,951
No.

257
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:07,051
Then, seriously, why don't you
take off your dress.

258
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:11,593
and walk over here in
your pretty new shoes?

259
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:50,951
Only a girl with a Gold Card would
leave her dress on the floor.

260
00:34:57,580 --> 00:34:59,991
Unbuckle my belt.

261
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:16,611
This started with me on the my knees.

262
00:35:16,740 --> 00:38:18,730
Now it's your turn.

263
00:35:35,571 --> 00:35:40,725
Fuck you.

264
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:45,230
My panties, rip them off.

265
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:52,131
Do it.

266
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:14,916
He made love like he
worked on the street.

267
00:37:16,420 --> 00:37:18,831
Tender as a jackhammer.

268
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:22,451
Tender as a jackhammer.

269
00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:26,771
Jesus.

270
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:20,888
August 20th

271
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:27,831
I told my self over and over,

272
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:32,675
once could be rationalized as
a foolish mistake,

273
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:38,294
temporary insanity, an act of passion.

274
00:38:38,460 --> 00:38:42,213
Twice was irreversible.

275
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:47,120
Who is it?

276
00:38:57,640 --> 00:38:59,451
I like that.

277
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:13,850
The minute i saw him,

278
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:18,550
I understood what I wanted.

279
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:21,931
Something I've never had in my life.

280
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:26,716
Something I've always gladly
given up to others.

281
00:39:33,860 --> 00:39:38,369
The greatest aphrosidiac of all:

282
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:43,050
control.

283
00:41:15,540 --> 00:41:19,712
Hi, we'rw not in right now.
Work, work, work.

284
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:22,351
Leave us a message.

285
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:13,795
I haven't seen him in two weeks.
He's out of my life

286
00:42:13,810 --> 00:42:17,658
like an alcoholic coming off the hooch.

287
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:23,590
One minute, one hour,
one day at the time.

288
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:28,591
And I'll never see him again.

289
00:42:28,620 --> 00:42:32,931
This kind is more expensive, of course,

290
00:42:33,060 --> 00:42:36,371
- but it's hundred percent silk.
- Excuse me just a moment.

291
00:42:36,890 --> 00:42:41,232
I'm sorry to bother you, there's a
guy who says he's your brother.

292
00:42:47,860 --> 00:42:49,871
I'm gonna send you two off
with Michelle.

293
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:52,871
She's gonna show you the other
colours and patterns.

294
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:56,349
Just give me fifteen minutes and we'll
finish everything off. Okay?.

295
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:58,991
- Right this way please.
- Thanks, Michelle.

296
00:43:03,780 --> 00:43:08,530
- See what'd tell you?
- What a surprise.

297
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:20,236
I told her I was your brother.
I don't think she belived me.

298
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:25,874
How did you find me?

299
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:32,728
It wasn't hard.
I let my fingers do the walking.

300
00:43:35,100 --> 00:43:37,611
I hate your suit.

301
00:43:40,300 --> 00:43:43,891
Funny, I thought it
looked good on me.

302
00:43:44,780 --> 00:43:51,316
He belonged to my father.
He wore it everyday of his life.

303
00:43:51,740 --> 00:43:53,951
Said it brought him luck.

304
00:43:55,140 --> 00:43:56,970
Why are you here?

305
00:43:58,700 --> 00:44:01,872
I wanted you.

306
00:44:02,340 --> 00:44:05,751
I want you all the time now.

307
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:10,055
I don't even know your name.
That's the way I want to keep it.

308
00:44:10,100 --> 00:44:12,856
My name is Tom.

309
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:15,934
That's short for
Thomas K. Butler.

310
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:20,715
- I don't wanna hear it.
- Same name as my dad.

311
00:44:21,820 --> 00:44:24,131
Please.

312
00:44:25,180 --> 00:44:27,653
Everybody used to call me Junior.

313
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:31,976
After my dad died,

314
00:44:32,180 --> 00:44:35,556
my mother started calling
me Tom for the first time.

315
00:44:38,220 --> 00:44:40,231
I didn't even know who
she was talking to.

316
00:44:42,020 --> 00:44:45,431
I had to drop out of school to
help support my brothers.

317
00:44:45,505 --> 00:44:49,671
Gave up football scholarship
to the University of Illinois.

318
00:44:49,700 --> 00:44:52,671
What the hell, right?

319
00:44:52,730 --> 00:44:55,411
You gotta do what you gotta do.

320
00:44:59,660 --> 00:45:02,312
I'm sorry you don't like my suit.

321
00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:09,612
Pick out another one for me and
I'll go down and buy it.

322
00:45:10,520 --> 00:45:14,508
You can pick up my underwear,
my shirts,

323
00:45:14,620 --> 00:45:19,155
anything you want.
And I'll wear them.

324
00:45:20,220 --> 00:45:22,531
You know why?

325
00:45:22,620 --> 00:45:24,831
Because you're the one of
the only really nice things

326
00:45:24,920 --> 00:45:26,875
that's ever happened to me.

327
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:33,777
When I'm with you I feel like
I just stepped out of the shower.

328
00:45:33,850 --> 00:45:38,831
I feel clean.
Please, look at me.

329
00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:43,855
What I'm saying is important.

330
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:53,579
If you don't come to me,
I'm gonna come to you.

331
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:58,851
I'll find out where you live,
I'll camp out on your doorstep.

332
00:45:58,886 --> 00:46:03,696
Think your boyfriend will believe
that I'm your brother?

333
00:46:08,700 --> 00:46:10,549
I'll see you around.

334
00:46:29,820 --> 00:46:31,893
Now he has a name.

335
00:46:34,300 --> 00:46:37,670
No place to run. No place to hide.

336
00:46:39,900 --> 00:46:41,520
Trapped.

337
00:47:23,360 --> 00:47:26,671
October 21st: my 26th birthday.

338
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:31,056
Now remember, keep a happy face.

339
00:48:07,080 --> 00:48:10,408
- Shall I make a wish?
- Wish first. Concentrate.

340
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:33,830
I don't wanna kiss you,
I wanna make a toast to

341
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:37,800
lovely, gorgeous, stunning, radiant Alex,

342
00:48:37,850 --> 00:48:42,679
whose perfect life I think
matches her perfect beauty

343
00:48:42,780 --> 00:48:45,811
and Alex and I've been friends for...

344
00:48:45,870 --> 00:48:50,657
How long? Tell the truth.

345
00:48:50,700 --> 00:48:52,811
No, since... Wait.
Since we were seventeen.

346
00:48:53,860 --> 00:48:56,718
Seventeen?
Please say you're seventeen.

347
00:49:30,820 --> 00:49:32,672
Are you okay?

348
00:49:32,860 --> 00:49:36,551
Yes. I might be coming down
with a flu or something.

349
00:49:36,860 --> 00:49:39,545
That's what I told your brother when
you didn't show up for work today.

350
00:49:39,560 --> 00:49:41,851
- My brother?
- He called. He was worried about you.

351
00:49:41,900 --> 00:49:46,640
I said you hadn't been feeling well
and you were at home resting.

352
00:49:47,080 --> 00:49:51,017
You didn't tell him where I live,
did you?

353
00:49:51,085 --> 00:49:53,691
He asked for your telephone number.

354
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:56,911
He's your brother, for Christsake's,
I gave it to him.

355
00:49:58,680 --> 00:50:00,025
- Hey.
- Okay.

356
00:50:00,060 --> 00:50:02,915
- Come on, please. Have a good time.
- I'm fine.

357
00:50:03,060 --> 00:50:06,815
It's your birthday. We love you.

358
00:50:06,850 --> 00:50:10,832
How does anyone know what
anyone else is feeling?

359
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:16,635
How can I turn to?
Who can I talk to?

360
00:50:18,120 --> 00:50:19,909
I hate shrinks.

361
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:23,960
If I told my friends that my problem
was not one man, but two,

362
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,759
they'd kick me in the head.

363
00:50:26,780 --> 00:50:30,775
Maybe I should run an ad in the paper:

364
00:50:30,780 --> 00:50:35,906
"Woman out of control seeks clues
to own dark pain and passion.

365
00:50:36,580 --> 00:50:41,895
from other women's experiences.
Willing to pay top dollar.

366
00:50:41,940 --> 00:50:46,579
Send diaries to red shoes, P.O. BOx...

367
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:48,659
Whatever".

368
00:50:50,840 --> 00:50:53,849
- Come back. Here it comes.
- Did it break? - Not yet.

369
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:56,896
He's a tough little bastard.

370
00:51:04,680 --> 00:51:06,872
- A candy?
- Beautiful, isn't it?.

371
00:51:06,940 --> 00:51:10,351
No, no. Unwrap that first.

372
00:51:11,880 --> 00:51:15,511
- What's that?
- Atmosphere?

373
00:51:20,780 --> 00:51:22,838
- What's that?
- You'll see.

374
00:51:28,840 --> 00:51:32,651
- Come on over here. Come on.
- Where are we going?

375
00:51:32,700 --> 00:51:36,650
Just come with me. Sit.

376
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:40,650
- What's this?
- I want to do this right

377
00:51:40,685 --> 00:51:42,972
- Okay?
- Okay, go ahead.

378
00:51:47,150 --> 00:51:48,808
Its...

379
00:52:01,500 --> 00:52:03,395
A velvet box.

380
00:52:26,760 --> 00:52:29,316
Marry me, Alex.

381
00:52:39,580 --> 00:52:41,598
Is that a yes or a no?

382
00:52:44,060 --> 00:52:47,433
I think I had too much to
drink this afternoon.

383
00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:50,610
You wanna talk about it?

384
00:52:57,520 --> 00:53:01,317
Jake, I know you think you
know everything about me,

385
00:53:01,380 --> 00:53:05,356
but there's so much you don't know.

386
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:10,751
- Like what?
- Like...

387
00:53:12,620 --> 00:53:17,918
When I was a kid I was so screwed up
I listened to myself breathe at night

388
00:53:17,980 --> 00:53:23,289
because I thought if I didn't I
wouldn't wake up in the morning.

389
00:53:24,560 --> 00:53:28,471
I used to bang my head against
the wall untill it hurt.

390
00:53:28,500 --> 00:53:33,950
It was like I just
couldn't stop myself.

391
00:53:36,560 --> 00:53:38,828
All kids feel like that
from time to time.

392
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:42,631
No. I'm talking dark.

393
00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:44,854
So dark it scared the shit
out of my parents.

394
00:53:45,865 --> 00:53:47,754
Who? Not your mother.

395
00:53:54,840 --> 00:53:57,954
She took me to all types of
doctors 'cause she...

396
00:53:59,640 --> 00:54:02,854
She thought it was my thyroid,
but it wasn't my thyroid, Jake.

397
00:54:02,900 --> 00:54:07,854
And it just got worse and
she got really scared.

398
00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:11,554
She got so scared because,

399
00:54:11,600 --> 00:54:14,154
it's the only thing
she couldn't control.

400
00:54:29,840 --> 00:54:34,964
I can remember writing this elaborate
will when I was eleven.

401
00:54:37,840 --> 00:54:41,454
And then when I didn't die, I wrote
another one when I was fifteen.

402
00:54:42,340 --> 00:54:47,154
- I was so fucked up.
- Those days are over, baby.

403
00:54:48,840 --> 00:54:52,354
Fuck it! I can't even drive a car.

404
00:54:52,380 --> 00:54:57,985
I'm the only person in Los Angeles
who can't drive a car.

405
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:01,300
Any idiot can drive a car, baby.

406
00:55:01,340 --> 00:55:03,914
It takes a genius to get her
friends to drive her everywhere.

407
00:55:04,840 --> 00:55:07,254
Stop. I don't want to.

408
00:55:16,850 --> 00:55:18,954
That's the thing about life.

409
00:55:21,640 --> 00:55:25,754
If you look at thing hard enough,

410
00:55:27,870 --> 00:55:29,554
long enough, in the harsh
light of the day,

411
00:55:29,650 --> 00:55:33,124
you'll eventually see the flaws.

412
00:55:36,740 --> 00:55:40,034
That's why everything I make
I design with lots of shadows.

413
00:55:41,840 --> 00:55:43,754
The shadows make things beautiful.

414
00:55:48,540 --> 00:55:53,654
Special. Your shadows make
you beautiful, Alex,

415
00:55:54,840 --> 00:55:56,434
I love you.

416
00:55:58,540 --> 00:56:00,624
I want you to marry me.

417
00:56:01,540 --> 00:56:04,654
It was like I was Standing
outside myself,

418
00:56:05,340 --> 00:56:08,469
watching pieces of a puzzle
fall into place.

419
00:56:08,740 --> 00:56:11,991
The whole picture of my life,

420
00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:16,689
all the patterns that keep repeating.

421
00:56:17,240 --> 00:56:19,689
All the same rotten mistakes.

422
00:56:19,700 --> 00:56:24,976
Why when I have a good thing going,
do I always checkmate myself?

423
00:56:54,850 --> 00:56:56,165
What's the matter with you, Rita?

424
00:56:56,200 --> 00:56:59,595
Your boyfriend keeping you up nights?
You look like shit!

425
00:56:59,600 --> 00:57:03,671
And one, and two, and three,

426
00:57:04,740 --> 00:57:08,751
and four, and five, and six,

427
00:57:08,940 --> 00:57:11,751
and seven, and eight.

428
00:57:17,460 --> 00:57:19,957
All right, ladies,
that'll be all for today.

429
00:57:29,120 --> 00:57:33,853
- So tell me. what's his name?
- Jake, mother. - Jake.

430
00:57:33,920 --> 00:57:36,530
Exactly what kind of
an architect are you?

431
00:57:36,540 --> 00:57:41,313
Hope not one of those conceptual
assholes spending his life therifing

432
00:57:41,340 --> 00:57:42,813
the utopian environment.

433
00:57:42,920 --> 00:57:47,850
- Jake designs skyscrapers.
- Design and build are different things.

434
00:57:49,180 --> 00:57:50,132
He builds them to.

435
00:57:51,260 --> 00:57:55,050
- I despise intimidating men.
- Jake's not intimidating.

436
00:57:55,120 --> 00:57:59,537
Is that so? He bamboozled you,
otherwise you wouldn't defend him.

437
00:58:00,080 --> 00:58:03,810
I don't know what she told you, but
her father was a real cocksucker.

438
00:58:04,900 --> 00:58:08,295
You're not one of those passive
aggressive types, are you?

439
00:58:08,380 --> 00:58:10,495
No, I'm just aggressive.

440
00:58:11,600 --> 00:58:14,871
And intimidating.
Are you a good lover?

441
00:58:15,720 --> 00:58:18,370
- Oh god.
- Are you attentive!

442
00:58:18,700 --> 00:58:23,611
Patient? Unselfish?
Do you take your time?

443
00:58:25,400 --> 00:58:27,878
Shut the door and
you'll find out.

444
00:58:44,840 --> 00:58:46,800
Hey, wait a minute!

445
00:58:47,560 --> 00:58:48,885
Fuck your mother.
She can piss on my head.

446
00:58:48,920 --> 00:58:52,531
I don't care. It doesn't change
what I feel about you.

447
00:58:52,620 --> 00:58:56,794
You've said enough about
my fucking mother. Fuck you.

448
00:59:04,860 --> 00:59:09,394
Look at me.
What are you afraid of?

449
00:59:11,560 --> 00:59:12,948
What?

450
00:59:19,320 --> 00:59:22,698
Don't run away. what
are you afraid of?

451
00:59:27,760 --> 00:59:31,371
Hi, we're not in right now.
Work, work,work.

452
00:59:31,540 --> 00:59:33,531
Leave us a message.

453
00:59:37,400 --> 00:59:41,616
I... If you're there, this is me.

454
00:59:41,800 --> 00:59:46,616
what's going on?
Your office is closed and I...

455
00:59:50,680 --> 00:59:52,138
I miss you.

456
01:00:00,150 --> 01:00:05,358
Can't let him intimidate me.
Can't let him frighten me.

457
01:00:06,080 --> 01:00:08,596
Got to tell him face to face.

458
01:00:08,650 --> 01:00:12,508
If I can't do that, if I can't sit
in a room across from him,

459
01:00:12,560 --> 01:00:16,515
and tell him that it,s over,
then I'n not worth shit.

460
01:00:16,640 --> 01:00:20,190
Not worth a shit.

461
01:00:24,560 --> 01:00:28,110
- I'm looking for Tom Butler.
- Yeah. What for?

462
01:00:28,260 --> 01:00:30,971
- A letter.
- Right here.

463
01:00:32,880 --> 01:00:36,470
- Sign right here for me.
- All right.

464
01:00:37,840 --> 01:00:41,808
- Here you go. - All yours.
- Thanks a lot.

465
01:00:41,900 --> 01:00:43,814
- Hey, nice boots.
- Thanks.

466
01:01:23,260 --> 01:01:24,830
Where's the shoes?

467
01:01:26,300 --> 01:01:27,934
Worn out.

468
01:01:29,800 --> 01:01:32,834
It's all that running away
you've been doing.

469
01:01:36,700 --> 01:01:40,156
I stopped by your office three
times this week.

470
01:01:41,860 --> 01:01:43,220
Where were you?

471
01:01:47,360 --> 01:01:49,476
I had flu.

472
01:01:53,800 --> 01:01:56,956
And you're better now?
Is that what we are celebrating?

473
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,199
I'm getting married.

474
01:02:03,820 --> 01:02:06,669
I won't be seeing you anymore.

475
01:02:06,710 --> 01:02:09,693
Is this a game?
Are you playing with me?

476
01:02:09,860 --> 01:02:13,916
I know you have my home number.
Please don't use it.

477
01:02:14,680 --> 01:02:16,231
Ever.

478
01:02:17,460 --> 01:02:20,671
- Say: "Please don't use it Tom."
- It's over between us.

479
01:02:21,680 --> 01:02:25,672
It ain't over 'till it's over.
That's just the way it is.

480
01:02:25,707 --> 01:02:31,355
I came here to see you.
To feel you.

481
01:02:33,450 --> 01:02:35,791
To make love to you.

482
01:02:35,850 --> 01:02:40,611
There's no way that I'm gonna
leave here until I do.

483
01:02:41,140 --> 01:02:44,093
Not a chance.

484
01:02:44,740 --> 01:02:46,993
It ain't over 'till it's over.

485
01:02:49,260 --> 01:02:52,835
Make a move.
I'll move faster.

486
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,380
Touch me again and i'll scream.

487
01:02:59,520 --> 01:03:03,212
Scream then. Get it over with.

488
01:03:08,080 --> 01:03:09,991
Get it over with.

489
01:03:10,880 --> 01:03:12,611
I'll have your clothes ripped off.

490
01:03:14,120 --> 01:03:18,200
I'll be inside you before they
break down the door.

491
01:03:18,860 --> 01:03:21,206
It ain't over 'till it's over.

492
01:03:21,220 --> 01:03:25,420
I'll be like one of those dogs
you see in the park.

493
01:03:25,820 --> 01:03:28,620
They'll have to turn a firehouse
on me to get me off you.

494
01:03:29,860 --> 01:03:31,672
Please don't talk that way.

495
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:34,916
Why? Does it excite you?

496
01:03:35,060 --> 01:03:39,713
- It make me sick.
- Puke then.

497
01:03:44,220 --> 01:03:47,051
But please, don't leave me.

498
01:03:49,540 --> 01:03:51,452
It's tragic, isn't it?

499
01:03:53,860 --> 01:03:57,979
I thught that if you didn't know me,
you couldn't control me.

500
01:03:58,240 --> 01:04:01,876
Now here I am again.

501
01:04:05,800 --> 01:04:07,737
I'm an open book.

502
01:04:14,600 --> 01:04:17,697
I want you to let me go, Tom.

503
01:04:25,100 --> 01:04:31,670
Say my name again.
I love it when you say my name.

504
01:04:31,760 --> 01:04:34,971
Things have a life and that life
comes to an end.

505
01:04:36,140 --> 01:04:40,410
Sit down. I won't move
if you don't want me to.

506
01:04:42,540 --> 01:04:45,294
I just want to feel you here.

507
01:04:47,750 --> 01:04:51,689
No, not like that. Like this.

508
01:04:56,400 --> 01:05:01,630
- can you feel how much I want ou?
- Yes.

509
01:05:01,780 --> 01:05:06,591
Does it feel good?
Do you feel the way it feels?

510
01:05:06,820 --> 01:05:07,959
Yes.

511
01:05:08,540 --> 01:05:12,874
Do you thing that's something
with no life left in it?

512
01:05:13,540 --> 01:05:16,874
Do you think I can
just walk out that door?

513
01:05:22,380 --> 01:05:26,591
When I come I'm only gonna
wanna come again.

514
01:05:26,840 --> 01:05:31,551
That's the way it is.
It ain't over 'till it's over.

515
01:05:32,340 --> 01:05:35,351
I'm gonna kiss you goodbye tonight,

516
01:05:35,360 --> 01:05:37,951
then I'm gonna kiss you hello again
next week.

517
01:05:47,540 --> 01:05:49,538
Yes, yes, yes.

518
01:05:50,600 --> 01:05:54,811
- Yes.
- It feels good, doesn't it?

519
01:05:54,870 --> 01:05:58,051
From now on, Wednesdays are mine.

520
01:09:30,960 --> 01:09:32,951
You're out of control.

521
01:11:33,620 --> 01:11:37,431
Hey, you don't answer my phone calls!

522
01:11:37,520 --> 01:11:41,431
If you don't come to the door at
least come to the windows.

523
01:11:41,480 --> 01:11:44,553
I need to know what your plans are.

524
01:11:44,560 --> 01:11:46,593
I need to know if you'll ever
come back to work.

525
01:11:46,640 --> 01:11:51,428
Look, what happened to you is
horrible. Nobody can deny that.

526
01:11:51,560 --> 01:11:55,789
But a lot of people put a lot of
money and a lot of faith in us,

527
01:11:55,900 --> 01:11:59,811
and when they ask questions,
they deserve answers.

528
01:12:00,920 --> 01:12:04,631
I'll cover you. Just
give me a date, a time.

529
01:12:04,655 --> 01:12:09,491
A week, a month. Six months,
whatever. I just need to know.

530
01:12:09,520 --> 01:12:13,891
Jake, don't be an asshole.

531
01:12:15,430 --> 01:12:16,431
Damn!

532
01:13:15,500 --> 01:13:17,111
Hey, where'd you come from?

533
01:13:24,460 --> 01:13:26,371
What can I do for you?

534
01:13:26,540 --> 01:13:32,349
I'm looking for something for
a friend. Very high, very sexy.

535
01:13:32,580 --> 01:13:35,891
- Maybe red.
- Yeah. What size?

536
01:13:35,900 --> 01:13:40,819
- Seven, seven and a half.
- Okay, I'll see what I got for you.

537
01:13:55,420 --> 01:13:56,714
Everything but red.

538
01:13:59,080 --> 01:14:00,134
Blue.

539
01:14:01,780 --> 01:14:02,890
Pink.

540
01:14:06,480 --> 01:14:07,534
And I heve green.

541
01:14:07,600 --> 01:14:10,811
I had my heart set on red.

542
01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:15,209
It's too bad.
It's a popular colour.

543
01:14:15,640 --> 01:14:17,291
Hey, there. What's your name?
What do they call you?

544
01:14:18,600 --> 01:14:21,234
Stella. Stella.

545
01:14:23,420 --> 01:14:27,680
You know who said that? Stanley Kowalski,
"Street car named desire". Yap?

546
01:14:27,880 --> 01:14:32,634
Tried out for the role in school,
they gave it to one kid with pimples.

547
01:14:32,880 --> 01:14:35,028
That's too bad.

548
01:14:37,160 --> 01:14:40,676
Red shoes with high heels?
I hear that.

549
01:14:41,040 --> 01:14:45,854
Playoffs. Must be the end
of the half. I love basketball.

550
01:14:47,740 --> 01:14:54,476
Thirteen triple E. Nine wide
in eleven and a half double E.

551
01:14:54,511 --> 01:14:58,633
- Am I right? - Yes, right.
- Alright.

552
01:15:27,640 --> 01:15:31,549
- What's up, man? Are you following me?
- Hey, the shoe salesman.

553
01:15:31,800 --> 01:15:34,400
- How you doing?
- Alright. How you doing? A beer?

554
01:15:34,640 --> 01:15:38,551
- I'd love one. - Reese, two beers.
- Okay, two beers.

555
01:15:40,543 --> 01:15:43,000
- I'll pay for that.
- That's alright. Beer, man.

556
01:15:43,100 --> 01:15:44,850
- Thank you.
- My one and only love.

557
01:15:52,430 --> 01:15:54,530
Yes! NCAA action, you can't beat it.

558
01:15:55,840 --> 01:15:59,560
Basketball, beer,
an occasional woman or two.

559
01:16:02,660 --> 01:16:05,860
In a perfect world I'd be black,
6,9 feet and they'd call me Mike.

560
01:16:06,500 --> 01:16:09,520
Some of the guys I played against
in the pick up games around here

561
01:16:09,660 --> 01:16:14,540
are as good as the ones up there,
they took a wrong turn.

562
01:16:14,610 --> 01:16:17,150
- Really?
- You know what I mean? - I do.

563
01:16:17,210 --> 01:16:21,350
- How much money you got on you?
- How much I got on me?

564
01:16:21,520 --> 01:16:23,120
Why, do you need some money?

565
01:16:23,160 --> 01:16:26,650
I bet you a thousand dollars against
whatever you have in your pocket

566
01:16:27,080 --> 01:16:29,950
that I can beat you in a game
of twenty one.

567
01:16:30,230 --> 01:16:31,860
What?

568
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:35,350
I bet you a grand against whatever
you have in your pocket

569
01:16:35,400 --> 01:16:38,350
that I can spot you ten points
and still kick your ass.

570
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:42,430
- What, are you kidding me?
- Don't I look like a ballplayer to you?

571
01:16:42,800 --> 01:16:44,750
- No.
- Really?

572
01:16:44,980 --> 01:16:47,360
Not everybody looks
like who they are.

573
01:16:47,400 --> 01:16:50,650
I'd never have thought you were a
guy that sells ladies shoes.

574
01:16:50,720 --> 01:16:52,830
It's a just a part-time job.

575
01:16:53,050 --> 01:16:56,180
I know. When I was a kid, my
mother used to take me shopping,

576
01:16:56,200 --> 01:17:02,120
the guys selling shoes were dignified
with greying hair at the temples,

577
01:17:02,150 --> 01:17:04,820
drink Martinis at lunch,

578
01:17:04,850 --> 01:17:08,650
who would have been gigolos in Miami
beach if they could go there.

579
01:17:09,130 --> 01:17:11,150
That's my idea of shoe salesman.

580
01:17:12,510 --> 01:17:15,120
But you really never know who
somebody is until you test them.

581
01:17:15,680 --> 01:17:18,010
- You never know?
- You don't know.

582
01:17:18,050 --> 01:17:20,620
A grand against whatever
you have in your pocket

583
01:17:20,850 --> 01:17:26,320
says I am who I pretend to be and
I can kick your ass on the court.

584
01:17:27,850 --> 01:17:30,850
What do you say, Michael?
You ready to be tested?

585
01:16:32,550 --> 01:17:30,885
What have you got to lose.

586
01:17:34,750 --> 01:17:38,720
I've called dozens of times,
left dozens of messages.

587
01:17:34,750 --> 01:17:38,720
- I never got a chance...
- Marlene... - Hi.

588
01:17:41,650 --> 01:17:44,020
- I'm just having a beer.
- I'm sorry.

589
01:17:44,055 --> 01:17:44,320
We'll talk about it later.

590
01:17:46,730 --> 01:17:51,720
My friend Ingrid, and this is
Ingrid's friend, Heidi

591
01:17:51,730 --> 01:17:54,720
- and Heidi's friend, Heidi.
- Heidi again.

592
01:17:54,750 --> 01:17:58,720
- And this is Jake and...
who's your friend? - Tom.

593
01:17:58,800 --> 01:18:02,220
- Thomas K. Butler Jr.
- Hi. Tom. - Skol.

594
01:18:02,450 --> 01:18:05,820
- Skol. - Ingrid and I were cheerleaders
together in high school.

595
01:18:07,650 --> 01:18:10,820
Red, white, fight, fight.

596
01:18:10,910 --> 01:18:13,820
Who fight? Red, white!
Fight, fight!

597
01:18:14,350 --> 01:18:15,820
Fight!

598
01:18:18,750 --> 01:18:21,620
She was the "Exchange student extraordinaire",

599
01:18:21,650 --> 01:18:23,220
I was of course " Miss personality".

600
01:18:23,650 --> 01:18:29,720
Now, Ingrid's best friend is Heidi
and Heidi's best friend is Heidi.

601
01:18:30,350 --> 01:18:32,620
- Heidi one and Heidi two.
- Heidi iho.

602
01:18:33,150 --> 01:18:38,320
Heidi one doesn't speak any English
but is just,

603
01:18:38,850 --> 01:18:42,580
knocked out by America.
Aren't you, Heidi? - Yes.

604
01:18:42,850 --> 01:18:44,720
Yes, amd American men.

605
01:18:45,350 --> 01:18:48,220
She says yes to everything.
It's the only word she knows.

606
01:18:49,850 --> 01:18:52,620
I think I've died and
I'm gone to heaven.

607
01:18:53,450 --> 01:18:56,620
Let's bring them along, we play,
they can cheerlead, you and me.

608
01:19:14,850 --> 01:19:16,520
Allright, make the take.

609
01:19:22,850 --> 01:19:26,420
Ten zip. My ball. Twenty-one.

610
01:19:37,450 --> 01:19:45,230
Jake, Jake he's our man.
If he can't do it, nobody can.

611
01:19:47,450 --> 01:19:51,130
Jake, Jake he's our man.
If he can't do it, nobody can.

612
01:19:51,550 --> 01:19:55,130
Hey, what about me?
Isn't anybody going to cheer for me?

613
01:20:13,450 --> 01:20:15,130
Huddle up, huddle up!

614
01:20:16,850 --> 01:20:19,200
Jake... Three!

615
01:20:25,150 --> 01:20:28,120
I'm surprised at you, Tom.
From the way you talked,

616
01:20:28,835 --> 01:20:31,220
I figured you'be a lot quicker.
Must be the beer, the latitude.

617
01:20:43,150 --> 01:20:44,820
DoctorJack, my ass.

618
01:20:54,730 --> 01:20:58,120
Get off the court,
get off the court now.

619
01:20:58,930 --> 01:21:03,620
Just get off the court,
you're gonna get hurt.

620
01:21:03,630 --> 01:21:05,320
Tom, Tom, he's our man.

621
01:21:05,550 --> 01:21:08,620
Jake, you want some oxygen?

622
01:21:10,750 --> 01:21:12,820
You did that when you were a kid?

623
01:21:12,840 --> 01:21:15,520
Make belive you were an announcer
calling big game?

624
01:21:27,750 --> 01:21:31,810
Time out! Time out!
Medical time out.

625
01:21:31,850 --> 01:21:33,310
Chapagne break.

626
01:21:35,550 --> 01:21:39,320
- Poor baby.
- You get a cold towel, not too bad.

627
01:21:40,160 --> 01:21:46,820
Fuck! Jake, I'm sorry. I didn't mean
to fuck up your beautiful floor.

628
01:21:47,060 --> 01:21:52,120
- No wait.
- Did you get a towel? Get a towel.

629
01:21:58,485 --> 01:22:01,210
Just wipe it up with this.

630
01:22:01,350 --> 01:22:03,510
Shit, you need a... I have a thing...

631
01:22:14,310 --> 01:22:16,250
Contraceptive?

632
01:22:17,410 --> 01:22:22,250
Hope and fear rolled into me.
Talk about paranoia.

633
01:22:22,510 --> 01:22:26,510
- Talk about wishful thinking.
- Come on Michael. Let's go.

634
01:22:28,410 --> 01:22:31,510
I'll be back
I'm gonna toss this guy off.

635
01:22:32,710 --> 01:22:34,510
No basket, it's my ball

636
01:22:38,815 --> 01:22:42,910
You drew blood, you lose, pal.
That was an intentional foul.

637
01:22:44,410 --> 01:22:48,310
I'll let it slide this time,
but don't let it happen again.

638
01:22:48,380 --> 01:22:49,510
You got that?

639
01:22:54,425 --> 01:22:56,620
Oh! Excellent.

640
01:22:57,550 --> 01:22:59,810
I might have underestimated your
athletic ability there, Jake,

641
01:22:59,820 --> 01:23:03,510
but I could tell you lived in such
a place just by looking at you.

642
01:23:03,520 --> 01:23:07,350
Just one look and you said I was
living in a renovated glue factory?

643
01:23:07,520 --> 01:23:11,850
I could tell by your shoes. You could
tell almost everything from them.

644
01:23:11,870 --> 01:23:13,660
Come on, Jake!

645
01:23:18,320 --> 01:23:22,960
Chicks in worn heels,
cracked insteps and scuffs.

646
01:23:23,400 --> 01:23:26,260
I can see their kitchen sinks,
cigarette butts,

647
01:23:26,300 --> 01:23:28,660
plates piled high with mouldy food.

648
01:23:28,700 --> 01:23:31,560
Now, chicks in two hundrd
dollar shoes from Paris.

649
01:23:31,600 --> 01:23:34,460
I can tell, not a scuff
on the heels of toes.

650
01:23:34,700 --> 01:23:37,660
I can take one look at 'em
and know everything I need.

651
01:23:37,700 --> 01:23:39,160
What do you know?

652
01:23:39,400 --> 01:23:42,960
I know what they're gonna smell like.
What they're gonna feel like

653
01:23:44,500 --> 01:23:47,460
Is that right, Tom?
Is that why you sell shoes?

654
01:23:47,700 --> 01:23:52,660
To pull up the shades to their souls?
Or you're gonna look at their feet?

655
01:23:52,700 --> 01:23:55,260
Maybe to catch a glimpse
up their skirts.

656
01:23:55,280 --> 01:23:59,560
I bet you keep a score card of how
many of them don't wear panties.

657
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:01,960
Tell me I'm right.

658
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:06,760
- Jake!
- This is crazy! Stop it!

659
01:24:06,890 --> 01:24:08,960
- That's twice.
- Yeah?

660
01:24:09,250 --> 01:24:11,960
Who the fuck cares?
Tell me what she smelled like.

661
01:24:12,100 --> 01:24:17,660
- Tell you who smelled like?
- The chick in the 200$ shoes.

662
01:24:17,675 --> 01:24:20,860
Was it like ivory snow?
Was it like fresh soap?

663
01:24:20,870 --> 01:24:25,220
I ain't talking about a chick.
I'm talking about chicks in general.

664
01:24:25,335 --> 01:24:27,860
And how many chicks
are chicks in general?

665
01:24:27,870 --> 01:24:31,760
Four, eight, ten, twelve, twenty?

666
01:24:31,880 --> 01:24:33,460
This is it! It's over!

667
01:24:33,550 --> 01:24:35,960
What do you call them when they're
all clumped together?

668
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:41,460
Gaggle? Phalanx? Choir? Possyy?

669
01:24:41,550 --> 01:24:45,660
Stop it, Jack. Someone's gonna
get hurt. I'm serious.

670
01:24:45,705 --> 01:24:47,760
What the fuck are you talking about?

671
01:24:47,950 --> 01:24:51,260
Tell me what she felt like.

672
01:24:51,345 --> 01:24:56,060
Soft as a baby's butt?
Soft as a kidskin glove?

673
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:58,460
You're fucking nuts, man.

674
01:25:03,855 --> 01:25:06,160
Am I? Tell me about these chicks.

675
01:25:06,455 --> 01:25:10,860
You know what they smell like
and you know what that taste like.

676
01:25:11,055 --> 01:25:14,160
Do you know what's inside their
heads? Anything about them?

677
01:25:14,255 --> 01:25:18,220
Do you know what makes them laugh?
What makes them scream?

678
01:25:20,755 --> 01:25:23,360
All I know is that
they all love shoes.

679
01:25:23,655 --> 01:25:25,360
Every single one of'em.

680
01:25:25,455 --> 01:25:29,660
And they go on buyin'em
until they die.

681
01:25:55,355 --> 01:25:57,760
Guys, this is it. Hey, stop!

682
01:26:01,655 --> 01:26:03,360
Fuck, man!

683
01:26:06,235 --> 01:26:08,360
You fucking win!

684
01:26:08,535 --> 01:26:11,360
Take your fucking goddamn money.
Here it is, take it.

685
01:26:11,435 --> 01:26:14,360
Take the fucking money and
shove it up your fucking ass.

686
01:26:14,535 --> 01:26:16,760
- Where is the bathroom?
- Straight ahead.

687
01:26:16,935 --> 01:26:21,560
Don't quit now, Stanley.
We're just getting warmed up.

688
01:26:21,735 --> 01:26:24,660
C'mon. I'll double your money
and I'll spot you five more points,

689
01:26:24,765 --> 01:26:27,000
and I'll still take you.

690
01:26:28,735 --> 01:26:30,760
That's your problem,
you give up too easy.

691
01:26:32,125 --> 01:26:36,760
Just think, if you had that part
of Stanley Kowalski in high scool,

692
01:26:36,805 --> 01:26:38,160
you could have been a star,

693
01:26:38,235 --> 01:26:41,630
you could have been out of the shoe
business into the show business.

694
01:26:41,735 --> 01:26:44,660
You could have chicks raining
down on you. Gaggles of them.

695
01:26:44,735 --> 01:26:48,660
Litters of them. Covens. Choirs, Phalanxes.

696
01:26:48,728 --> 01:26:56,731
You're a fucking shoe salesman,
you get down on your knees

697
01:26:56,760 --> 01:26:56,766
and you look up their skirts,
that's all you do.

698
01:26:56,845 --> 01:26:59,960
Get a real job, punk!

699
01:27:01,777 --> 01:27:08,160
You mother fucker. Shit, shit, shit!

700
01:27:15,400 --> 01:27:17,460
I miss her so much.

701
01:27:23,600 --> 01:27:27,360
She would always tell me
that I was okay.

702
01:27:28,840 --> 01:27:32,560
And that was pretty tough.

703
01:27:52,100 --> 01:27:53,460
No.

704
01:27:59,200 --> 01:28:04,760
I'm in love with a lady who
wears two hundred dollar shoes.

705
01:28:08,825 --> 01:28:10,760
She was never a chick.

706
01:28:13,625 --> 01:28:15,760
She was a always a lady.

707
01:28:37,225 --> 01:28:40,860
Doctor, lawyer, Indian chief.

708
01:28:42,825 --> 01:28:47,860
House in suburbs, Mercedes coupe.

709
01:28:49,625 --> 01:28:51,760
And now she's probably married,

710
01:28:53,125 --> 01:28:57,770
pregnant, starting to turn fat.

711
01:28:57,830 --> 01:29:02,880
- Yes.
- Yes.

712
01:29:19,215 --> 01:29:21,960
That's where I found her,

713
01:29:22,825 --> 01:29:25,960
in that room.

714
01:29:43,205 --> 01:29:45,750
Do you think that's all I'll
ever be, a shoe salesman?

715
01:29:48,825 --> 01:29:50,260
Don't answer that.

716
01:29:59,325 --> 01:30:01,660
Oh, Jake.

717
01:30:15,825 --> 01:30:20,760
The fucking bastard. Fuck you!

718
01:30:21,825 --> 01:30:25,785
- Come on out!
- Stop it!

719
01:30:27,225 --> 01:30:30,585
What are you doing?
Don't! Don't!

720
01:30:38,325 --> 01:30:40,985
I'm sorry. I just need to be alone.
I'm sorry.

721
01:30:41,325 --> 01:30:45,085
- Can you girls go? Please?
- Yes, sure.

722
01:30:45,825 --> 01:30:48,885
- I had a good time.
- Ingrid, did you see my bag?

723
01:30:53,625 --> 01:30:55,685
Thank you girls. Come.

724
01:31:04,425 --> 01:31:05,885
- My friend.
- What...?

725
01:31:05,925 --> 01:31:08,685
- I have to get my friend.
- Where you going? No.

726
01:31:08,725 --> 01:31:10,785
Okay, get your friend.

727
01:31:11,825 --> 01:31:15,585
- I'm gonna stay. I think I'd just stay.
with him and you. - No.

728
01:31:15,625 --> 01:31:19,885
I really think I should. You're do
something, I know you are.

729
01:31:19,905 --> 01:31:21,985
NO Marlene. I'm fine.

730
01:31:22,025 --> 01:31:25,585
- Don't fucking lie to me.
- I'm not lying.

731
01:31:25,825 --> 01:31:29,485
- Promise?
- Look. I'm fine. I'll call you.

732
01:31:29,625 --> 01:31:31,885
- You'll call me?
- Sure, I'll call you.

733
01:31:31,905 --> 01:31:33,785
- I'm fine. - I'll call you
in ten minutes. - Okay.

734
01:31:36,625 --> 01:31:38,885
Would you please hurry up?
You gotta go outside.

735
01:31:39,225 --> 01:31:41,785
- Heidi, come.
- Tom?

736
01:31:41,805 --> 01:31:44,085
- No Tom, no more Tom.
- Good night.

737
01:31:44,205 --> 01:31:46,685
Tom? Tom?

738
01:31:46,805 --> 01:31:49,685
Tom, this is me and you, Tom.

739
01:31:51,405 --> 01:31:52,950
Come on out, Tom.

740
01:31:56,805 --> 01:31:58,385
It's just me and you, Tom.

741
01:31:59,205 --> 01:32:01,685
One-on-one.

742
01:32:22,005 --> 01:32:23,885
What's this about?

743
01:32:25,705 --> 01:32:26,820
What do you want from me?

744
01:32:36,805 --> 01:32:39,685
Put them on, bitch.

745
01:33:26,435 --> 01:33:28,885
Where is she, motherfucker?

746
01:33:29,135 --> 01:33:30,685
Where is she?

747
01:33:55,835 --> 01:33:58,085
Where is she?

748
01:34:04,235 --> 01:34:05,685
She's dead.

749
01:34:09,035 --> 01:34:11,185
She killed herself.

750
01:37:29,250 --> 01:37:31,650
This is Alex's stuff.

751
01:37:42,685 --> 01:37:45,420
I loved your dauther.

752
01:37:46,460 --> 01:37:47,985
I know you did.

753
01:37:59,735 --> 01:38:01,385
It's not your fault.

754
01:38:03,435 --> 01:38:05,385
Yes, it is.

755
01:38:41,735 --> 01:38:44,585
Joey, can I get some quarters,
please?

756
01:39:41,735 --> 01:39:45,785
Hi, I'd like to take out an ad
in your Personals column.

Women, do you keep a diary?

758
01:39:53,700 --> 01:39:57,785
Have you been betrayed?
Have you betrayed another?
