1
00:01:13,648 --> 00:01:15,081
Any progress, Eric?

2
00:01:15,353 --> 00:01:18,155
Sorry, Professor Kaufman. There's still
something wrong with the program.

3
00:01:18,322 --> 00:01:23,485
We can't do any more experiments
with the laser until you boys fix it.

4
00:01:23,848 --> 00:01:25,281
We know. We know.

5
00:01:25,473 --> 00:01:27,654
Hey, wait! I've found something.

6
00:01:28,425 --> 00:01:31,283
- What?
- Who turned on the laser?

7
00:01:31,848 --> 00:01:33,440
Not me!

8
00:01:34,408 --> 00:01:38,401
- Shut it down!
- I can't! It's not responding!

9
00:01:51,156 --> 00:01:55,583
- What is that?
- I was hoping you'd know, professor.

10
00:02:10,324 --> 00:02:14,408
- He's absorbing all our computer data.
- Call security!

11
00:02:33,765 --> 00:02:37,634
- Like, are we there yet, Fred?
- I told you, Shaggy, soon.

12
00:02:37,888 --> 00:02:40,561
But you said that an hour ago, man.

13
00:02:41,528 --> 00:02:44,675
It's so impressive that Eric got
a grant for his computer project.

14
00:02:44,888 --> 00:02:49,359
Doesn't surprise me. Back in high school, he
practically lived in the computer lab. Right, Velma?

15
00:02:49,648 --> 00:02:53,960
- Yeah. He's one smart cookie.
- Cookie? Cookie?!

16
00:02:54,168 --> 00:02:57,604
Sorry, Scooby. Figure of speech.

17
00:02:58,008 --> 00:03:02,399
Cheer up, Scoob. When we get there,
we'll get to play the game Eric designed.

18
00:03:02,608 --> 00:03:06,567
- I bet it's way cooler than this one.
- Yeah, cooler!

19
00:03:06,808 --> 00:03:09,242
Imagine a computer game starring all of us!

20
00:03:09,448 --> 00:03:11,962
Solving mysteries in cyberspace.

21
00:03:18,382 --> 00:03:22,553
Like, I hope I do better
on Eric's game than this one.

22
00:03:50,208 --> 00:03:52,278
Where do you think you're going?

23
00:03:52,488 --> 00:03:55,480
To visit our friend Eric Staufer.
He's a student here.

24
00:03:55,672 --> 00:03:58,936
Not if you're not on my list.

25
00:03:59,323 --> 00:04:02,456
It should be under "Fred Jones".

26
00:04:02,968 --> 00:04:04,926
- Is this whole group with you?
- Yes, sir.

27
00:04:05,128 --> 00:04:09,246
- Including the dog?
- Dog? Where?

28
00:04:12,648 --> 00:04:15,401
There you are.
But just so you know...

29
00:04:15,478 --> 00:04:19,527
...I don't like a bunch of punks
running around my university.

30
00:04:19,688 --> 00:04:22,885
- Your university?
- It might as well be.

31
00:04:23,088 --> 00:04:27,878
I've been here for 20 years. There's
never been any trouble on my watch.

32
00:04:28,088 --> 00:04:32,047
I'm the head of security.
Wembley's the name.

33
00:04:35,808 --> 00:04:39,562
- Twenty years is an impressive record.
- You bet it is.

34
00:04:39,808 --> 00:04:42,527
I want to make sure that it stays...

35
00:04:45,888 --> 00:04:48,243
A wise guy, eh?

36
00:04:48,637 --> 00:04:51,883
I'm keeping a special eye
on you, pooch!

37
00:04:52,048 --> 00:04:53,197
Pooch?

38
00:04:53,683 --> 00:04:57,832
- Like, Scooby's just playing, officer.
- Yeah, sorry.

39
00:04:58,199 --> 00:05:01,242
We just need some help
finding the computer lab.

40
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:05,038
The lab is three buildings
down on the left.

41
00:05:05,528 --> 00:05:09,726
- Thanks.
- And keep your dog off the grass.

42
00:05:17,208 --> 00:05:21,121
Wow, Eric, this lab
is one groovy setup.

43
00:05:22,648 --> 00:05:24,445
We like it too.

44
00:05:29,774 --> 00:05:31,274
You don't want to eat those.

45
00:05:31,648 --> 00:05:33,557
Because they're grown in radioactive soil.

46
00:05:33,768 --> 00:05:35,520
Zoinks!

47
00:05:39,543 --> 00:05:41,868
- Everyone, this is my lab partner, Bill McLemore.
- Nice to meet you.

48
00:05:42,088 --> 00:05:45,285
Thanks for keeping Shaggy and Scooby
from glowing in the dark.

49
00:05:45,488 --> 00:05:49,766
- We'll go to dinner after the tour.
- But first, can you show us your new video game?

50
00:05:50,008 --> 00:05:52,203
Scoob and I have been dying to play it.

51
00:05:52,408 --> 00:05:57,118
No one is playing the game
until we get rid of our problem.

52
00:05:57,528 --> 00:06:00,838
Professor Kaufman, I'd like you to meet the
mystery gang I based my game on.

53
00:06:01,088 --> 00:06:03,326
- Oh, hi!
- Nice to meet you.

54
00:06:03,608 --> 00:06:05,997
The famous Mystery, Inc.

55
00:06:06,208 --> 00:06:08,483
And that's Scooby-Doo.

56
00:06:17,008 --> 00:06:21,001
It looks like you showed up
just in time for a mystery.

57
00:06:22,635 --> 00:06:24,326
- A mystery?
- Why? What happened?

58
00:06:24,568 --> 00:06:26,479
This is a hyper-energy laser.

59
00:06:26,682 --> 00:06:30,436
We've been using it to break down actual objects
and project them into cyberspace.

60
00:06:30,608 --> 00:06:35,807
Jinkies! You mean you can transport objects
from the real world into the computer world?

61
00:06:36,008 --> 00:06:40,160
- Precisely, young lady.
- That's fantastic!

62
00:06:40,736 --> 00:06:44,436
It was, until the laser beamed
a monster into our world last night.

63
00:06:45,748 --> 00:06:47,884
A monster?!

64
00:06:50,107 --> 00:06:54,024
Yes, the laser beamed a computer virus
right here into this lab.

65
00:06:54,208 --> 00:06:56,164
A really freaky-looking thing.

66
00:06:56,368 --> 00:06:59,838
He erased all the computers' data
by just walking near them.

67
00:07:00,858 --> 00:07:05,744
This virus is also able to control
and manipulate electrical objects.

68
00:07:06,327 --> 00:07:09,125
- But where did it come from?
- Eric's computer game.

69
00:07:09,408 --> 00:07:13,526
Computer viruses don't just appear.
They have to be created by someone.

70
00:07:13,808 --> 00:07:17,847
- But I didn't create it!
- I'm sure it wasn't Mr. Staufer.

71
00:07:18,048 --> 00:07:22,007
But whoever created this virus
is in serious trouble.

72
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:26,167
Our civilization is
so dependent on technology...

73
00:07:26,368 --> 00:07:29,678
...that this virus is a threat
to the entire world.

74
00:07:30,852 --> 00:07:32,774
Can you show us how the laser works?

75
00:07:32,968 --> 00:07:36,165
You can show the demo,
but don't start the game!

76
00:07:36,367 --> 00:07:37,952
Yes, sir.

77
00:07:48,745 --> 00:07:52,486
Like, check it out! We're digital!

78
00:07:52,688 --> 00:07:54,156
Yeah! Digital!

79
00:07:54,608 --> 00:07:58,283
We used the game to extrapolate
3- D data into quantum particles.

80
00:08:02,808 --> 00:08:05,959
- Of course, it's so simple!
- It is?

81
00:08:06,208 --> 00:08:11,407
He used the Scooby game as the location in
cyberspace to store physical objects.

82
00:08:11,787 --> 00:08:15,426
- And you're sure the virus came from the game?
- Unfortunately, yes.

83
00:08:15,648 --> 00:08:19,800
There's no virus in my baseball game,
and it's more entertaining.

84
00:08:24,128 --> 00:08:25,766
<i>Batter up!</i>

85
00:08:26,528 --> 00:08:28,598
<i>Strike one!</i>

86
00:08:28,808 --> 00:08:32,721
- Now, this is a game you can get into.
- That's really cool, Bill.

87
00:08:32,928 --> 00:08:36,364
- I'm a huge baseball fan myself.
- You have good taste, Fred.

88
00:08:36,568 --> 00:08:40,243
- I think it's the greatest sport in the world.
- Baseball's okay...

89
00:08:40,475 --> 00:08:43,526
- ... but it doesn't have Scooby and me in it.
- That's right!

90
00:08:43,728 --> 00:08:47,880
The Scooby game has 10 levels.
You battle monsters or villains...

91
00:08:48,128 --> 00:08:51,404
...while trying to find
Scooby Snacks on each level.

92
00:08:51,728 --> 00:08:54,288
Oh, boy! Scooby Snacks!

93
00:08:56,736 --> 00:08:58,675
Okay, Professor.

94
00:09:10,968 --> 00:09:13,357
Now, check out the monitor.

95
00:09:16,888 --> 00:09:17,718
- Cool!
- Jinkies!

96
00:09:17,928 --> 00:09:21,045
I wouldn't believe it
if I didn't see it with my own eyes!

97
00:09:21,335 --> 00:09:24,576
Like, I don't believe it either.

98
00:09:25,928 --> 00:09:28,557
We didn't even get one Scooby Snack.

99
00:09:31,263 --> 00:09:34,038
Eric and Bill are sure to win
the $250,000 grand prize...

100
00:09:34,288 --> 00:09:37,837
- ... at the international science fair.
- Wow, that's some prize.

101
00:09:38,088 --> 00:09:42,400
It'll be a reward for their talent
and hard work on the laser project.

102
00:09:42,608 --> 00:09:46,726
We couldn't have done it without you, prof.
Kaufman. You should share the reward too.

103
00:09:46,928 --> 00:09:50,284
No, no. As a teacher,
being able to guide young minds...

104
00:09:50,488 --> 00:09:54,037
...to their full potential
is reward enough, Eric.

105
00:09:54,248 --> 00:09:58,764
Speaking of rewards, is it possible to get
the Scooby Snacks out of the game?

106
00:10:12,448 --> 00:10:15,246
- Groovy!
- Oh, boy!

107
00:10:15,728 --> 00:10:17,525
- Hey, that's mine!
- No, mine!

108
00:10:17,728 --> 00:10:19,241
Mine!

109
00:10:19,425 --> 00:10:22,363
Is that the way the virus
came out of the game, Eric?

110
00:10:22,488 --> 00:10:24,399
Yeah. It was pretty scary.

111
00:10:24,608 --> 00:10:28,567
If it's just a computer virus,
what harm can it do in our world?

112
00:10:28,768 --> 00:10:32,283
From what we observed the last night,
this virus has the potential...

113
00:10:32,488 --> 00:10:35,560
...to steal every
computer program in the world.

114
00:10:35,643 --> 00:10:39,727
And the virus made the telephone
come to life, which attacked Eric.

115
00:10:43,208 --> 00:10:46,803
<i>It kept coming toward us
and we couldn’t't stop it. </i>

116
00:10:52,768 --> 00:10:56,443
<i>When I held up a magnetic bar
in defense... </i>

117
00:10:57,587 --> 00:11:01,321
<i>... it seemed to have
an adverse effect on the virus. </i>

118
00:11:02,683 --> 00:11:06,474
<i>Yeah. It seemed like the magnet weakened
him. Like kryptonite to Superman. </i>

119
00:11:12,568 --> 00:11:14,047
- Wow!
- Creepy!

120
00:11:14,161 --> 00:11:18,035
The security guards checked the campus,
but couldn't find him anywhere.

121
00:11:18,164 --> 00:11:23,568
I suspect that he is still
in this building somewhere.

122
00:11:24,153 --> 00:11:25,816
Still here?

123
00:11:25,968 --> 00:11:28,607
No more arguing, boys.

124
00:11:29,368 --> 00:11:32,201
So what can we do to help, Eric?

125
00:11:32,448 --> 00:11:35,565
If you can lure the Phantom Virus
into the lab...

126
00:11:35,631 --> 00:11:38,915
...I can use the laser to beam him
back into cyberspace.

127
00:11:39,056 --> 00:11:42,643
Great. Like, you want us
to be virus bait?

128
00:11:42,808 --> 00:11:46,743
- Like, no way, man.
- Uh-uh.

129
00:11:46,888 --> 00:11:50,164
Would you do it for a Scooby Snack?

130
00:11:50,847 --> 00:11:55,631
Hold on, Scoob. Only one Scooby Snack
to go chase a phantom?

131
00:11:55,808 --> 00:11:57,639
I don't think so.

132
00:11:57,848 --> 00:12:01,045
What if I gave you each
two Scooby Snacks?

133
00:12:05,648 --> 00:12:07,240
Okay, you got a deal.

134
00:12:07,888 --> 00:12:09,879
Go long, guys!

135
00:12:15,648 --> 00:12:19,960
This place is so big, we'll probably
never see this virus anyway.

136
00:12:22,328 --> 00:12:25,764
How do we capture the Phantom Virus
once we find him?

137
00:12:25,968 --> 00:12:29,881
The Phantom Virus is composed
of electromagnetic energy.

138
00:12:30,088 --> 00:12:34,366
Get close enough to him
with one of these super-magnets...

139
00:12:34,538 --> 00:12:37,567
...and it will render him helpless.

140
00:12:47,152 --> 00:12:50,738
Be careful, Scooby.
Those are pretty strong magnets.

141
00:12:51,528 --> 00:12:52,722
Sorry!

142
00:12:52,928 --> 00:12:57,718
- Now let's really put them to the test.
- I knew I could count on you guys.

143
00:13:02,408 --> 00:13:06,003
This building is so big!
This Phantom Virus could be anywhere.

144
00:13:06,248 --> 00:13:09,604
I think we stand a better chance
of finding it if we split up.

145
00:13:12,648 --> 00:13:15,367
Hey, you guys, I didn't say how
we were gonna split up.

146
00:13:15,608 --> 00:13:18,839
Like, do we ever do it any other way?

147
00:13:25,553 --> 00:13:28,105
Do we really have to look in the basement?

148
00:13:28,248 --> 00:13:32,287
We have to search the whole building,
top to bottom.

149
00:13:34,248 --> 00:13:36,887
This stuff looks like it should be
in the Smithsonian.

150
00:13:37,088 --> 00:13:39,556
Why do they bother keeping this old junk?

151
00:13:39,768 --> 00:13:44,683
Oh, I don't know. Some of this
old junk could be very valuable.

152
00:13:47,648 --> 00:13:49,604
Jinkies! It's him!

153
00:13:52,164 --> 00:13:55,680
- Uh-oh!
- Watch out!

154
00:14:06,848 --> 00:14:08,247
The magnets!

155
00:14:10,968 --> 00:14:14,961
Get back, you... creepy... thingy!

156
00:14:16,745 --> 00:14:18,417
"Creepy thingy"?

157
00:14:20,008 --> 00:14:21,964
You'll pay for this!

158
00:14:22,288 --> 00:14:23,960
We don't think so.

159
00:14:24,208 --> 00:14:25,721
Thingy!

160
00:14:33,048 --> 00:14:34,686
After him!

161
00:14:46,008 --> 00:14:49,398
- I wonder why they left?
- I don't know.

162
00:14:49,768 --> 00:14:53,602
Man, it's bad enough we're
always chasing real ghosts.

163
00:14:53,816 --> 00:14:57,275
Now we're chasing
computer-generated ones.

164
00:14:59,745 --> 00:15:02,662
It's a good thing phantoms
don't care about lunch.

165
00:15:12,688 --> 00:15:14,963
Santa Claus!

166
00:15:21,088 --> 00:15:22,646
I think we lost him.

167
00:15:22,848 --> 00:15:24,600
Wait! Look!

168
00:15:25,968 --> 00:15:27,037
What do we do?

169
00:15:27,248 --> 00:15:30,445
Get as close to him as possible
with our magnets.

170
00:15:33,088 --> 00:15:37,081
Ready? One, two, three!

171
00:15:39,528 --> 00:15:42,998
I thought I heard
some noise down here.

172
00:15:43,208 --> 00:15:46,120
What are you kids doing?
The basement's for staff only.

173
00:15:46,328 --> 00:15:48,523
We're hunting for the Phantom Virus.

174
00:15:48,728 --> 00:15:51,959
Yeah, I heard about
this so-called virus.

175
00:15:52,168 --> 00:15:54,682
I think it's some kind of a college prank.

176
00:15:54,825 --> 00:15:56,883
No, Officer Wembley. You see, we...

177
00:15:57,048 --> 00:16:00,358
You kids are coming with me back
to Kaufman's lab.

178
00:16:04,168 --> 00:16:07,638
Can you believe the cafeteria
ran out of food?

179
00:16:07,848 --> 00:16:11,636
- And we're still hungry.
- Yeah. Hungry!

180
00:16:18,733 --> 00:16:22,005
I think I saw a vending machine
down the hall.

181
00:16:22,168 --> 00:16:24,762
What is it, Scoob?
Oh, hello, Mr. Phantom.

182
00:16:24,844 --> 00:16:26,382
Zoinks!

183
00:16:40,168 --> 00:16:43,365
Thank you for volunteering
for our experiment, Mr. Virus.

184
00:16:43,648 --> 00:16:48,853
- Nurse, take the patient over to the table.
- Okay. This way, please.

185
00:16:50,048 --> 00:16:51,242
Sit down.

186
00:16:54,008 --> 00:16:55,760
Just relax.

187
00:16:58,688 --> 00:17:02,966
Now, can you tell us how many layers
are in an ideal club sandwich?

188
00:17:04,408 --> 00:17:08,037
Time's up. The correct answer is,
"Never enough! "

189
00:17:11,367 --> 00:17:13,235
Let's try one more.

190
00:17:13,488 --> 00:17:17,367
When's the best time to enjoy
a milkshake with your french fries?

191
00:17:17,928 --> 00:17:21,284
Time's up. The answer is, "Anytime! "

192
00:17:26,608 --> 00:17:28,246
Yikes!

193
00:18:33,137 --> 00:18:36,853
I'm worried about Shaggy and Scooby.
They've been gone for a long time.

194
00:18:37,225 --> 00:18:39,568
Maybe we should go look for them.

195
00:18:39,774 --> 00:18:43,542
Nobody goes anywhere
until Professor Kaufman gets back.

196
00:18:49,888 --> 00:18:52,197
- What was that?
- It's the Phantom!

197
00:19:32,488 --> 00:19:37,243
Jinkies! It looks like we've been
beamed into Eric's computer game.

198
00:19:39,526 --> 00:19:40,725
- What?
- The laser's been fired.

199
00:19:40,888 --> 00:19:43,038
At that Phantom Virus, I hope.

200
00:19:46,128 --> 00:19:48,881
I don't think so. Look here.

201
00:19:49,088 --> 00:19:52,717
Your friends have been transported
into cyberspace!

202
00:19:53,635 --> 00:19:56,672
So? Throw a switch or something
and get them out.

203
00:19:56,768 --> 00:20:00,363
But thing doesn't work that way. They have to
play through all the levels to get out.

204
00:20:00,568 --> 00:20:03,104
- You're kidding me.
- I wish he was.

205
00:20:03,688 --> 00:20:05,846
Until they can get out
by winning every level of the game...

206
00:20:06,048 --> 00:20:10,438
- ... the danger is very real.
- Danger?

207
00:20:11,577 --> 00:20:14,256
Check this out. I'm, like, a superhero!

208
00:20:14,373 --> 00:20:18,440
Be careful, Shaggy.
There's less gravity on the moon.

209
00:20:19,528 --> 00:20:22,165
Look! It's Super-Shaggy!

210
00:20:25,358 --> 00:20:28,112
Scooby, could you get Shaggy back here
before he hurts himself?

211
00:20:30,328 --> 00:20:32,444
Scooby-Dooby-Doo!

212
00:20:35,368 --> 00:20:39,964
Nice try, Scoob!
Like, catch me if you can.

213
00:20:44,953 --> 00:20:49,225
- Shaggy, are you all right?
- I think so.

214
00:20:49,442 --> 00:20:51,526
- But I made an important discovery.
- What's that?

215
00:20:51,608 --> 00:20:54,566
In this video game, you can get hurt.

216
00:20:54,642 --> 00:20:58,421
Or worse. We'd better be careful.

217
00:20:58,768 --> 00:21:03,717
Velma's right. Eric said this game
has creatures and who knows what else.

218
00:21:04,088 --> 00:21:06,477
Zoinks! I know who!

219
00:21:06,846 --> 00:21:10,481
- Oh, no!
- He must've gotten beamed into the game too.

220
00:21:15,768 --> 00:21:17,407
Yikes! Help!

221
00:21:17,726 --> 00:21:20,115
Oh, no! He's not alone.

222
00:21:22,366 --> 00:21:24,561
Let's play ball!

223
00:21:24,766 --> 00:21:26,836
Like, let's not!

224
00:21:27,863 --> 00:21:31,124
- I thought we were chasing him.
- Back at the lab, we were.

225
00:21:31,366 --> 00:21:36,565
- But here in the game, he's got friends.
- They don't look very friendly to me.

226
00:21:39,006 --> 00:21:41,042
I think we lost them.

227
00:21:41,846 --> 00:21:45,839
You know, getting beamed into cyberspace
might not be such a bad thing.

228
00:21:46,086 --> 00:21:48,156
- And how's that, Velma?
- Yeah!

229
00:21:48,364 --> 00:21:52,492
Maybe if we play along, we can
find out who created this virus.

230
00:21:52,646 --> 00:21:55,240
Right! Maybe we can find some clues.

231
00:21:55,474 --> 00:21:59,521
Remember what Eric said?
We need to find the box of Scooby Snacks.

232
00:21:59,726 --> 00:22:02,240
And, like, there it is!

233
00:22:05,126 --> 00:22:06,525
Wow, that was easy.

234
00:22:06,726 --> 00:22:10,321
It's only the first level of the game.
It's supposed to be easy.

235
00:22:10,526 --> 00:22:12,164
Over there!

236
00:22:13,362 --> 00:22:15,115
Oh, no! Here they come!

237
00:22:15,286 --> 00:22:17,277
- Look, a rover!
- Huh?

238
00:22:17,486 --> 00:22:21,081
- A moon rover!
- And what a cool paint job!

239
00:22:21,653 --> 00:22:24,067
Come on, guys!

240
00:22:26,846 --> 00:22:29,201
This thing needs new shocks!

241
00:22:29,406 --> 00:22:33,001
As long as it gets us away
from those moon goons, who cares?

242
00:22:33,362 --> 00:22:34,078
Oh, no! They've got
a set of wheels too!

243
00:22:43,326 --> 00:22:44,839
Zoinks!

244
00:22:45,166 --> 00:22:47,680
Step on it, Freddy! They're gaining on us!

245
00:22:47,886 --> 00:22:51,720
I am, but this is as fast as it goes.

246
00:22:55,686 --> 00:22:57,677
Man, he got us!

247
00:22:58,126 --> 00:23:01,118
It's okay, guys.
The Scooby Snacks are right there.

248
00:23:02,846 --> 00:23:05,360
Oh, boy! Scooby Snacks!

249
00:23:06,846 --> 00:23:08,484
Scooby-Dooby-Doo!

250
00:23:08,966 --> 00:23:10,604
Go, Scooby, go!

251
00:23:16,966 --> 00:23:18,319
Yikes!

252
00:23:21,966 --> 00:23:24,321
Stop that dog!

253
00:23:27,086 --> 00:23:29,361
Come on, Scoob! You can do it, pal!

254
00:23:30,086 --> 00:23:31,724
- Hi!
- Watch out!

255
00:23:49,366 --> 00:23:51,243
What happened to...?

256
00:24:01,726 --> 00:24:03,842
- What?
- Where are we now?

257
00:24:04,086 --> 00:24:09,080
If I'm not mistaken,
we're inside the Roman Colosseum.

258
00:24:10,206 --> 00:24:12,925
- Colosseum?
- Like, where they play football?

259
00:24:13,166 --> 00:24:15,600
Not exactly. In ancient Rome...

260
00:24:15,686 --> 00:24:20,351
...people used to gather in the Colosseum
to watch all kinds of events.

261
00:24:20,744 --> 00:24:22,078
You mean like sports and music?

262
00:24:22,251 --> 00:24:25,543
Yeah, they did that too. But the Colosseum
is famous as the place...

263
00:24:25,674 --> 00:24:28,065
...where Romans fed people
to the lions for lunch.

264
00:24:28,226 --> 00:24:30,796
- Lions?
- Well, it looks deserted now.

265
00:24:31,086 --> 00:24:36,285
Speaking of lunch, we didn't even get to keep
the Scooby Snacks from the moon level.

266
00:24:37,486 --> 00:24:41,877
Don't worry, Scoob. I bet there's
a concession stand somewhere.

267
00:24:42,486 --> 00:24:45,956
- What's this?
- What are these white lines for?

268
00:24:47,766 --> 00:24:48,915
Like, it's chalk!

269
00:24:49,526 --> 00:24:52,324
Yikes! Virus!

270
00:24:53,446 --> 00:24:58,361
Welcome to level two, game players,
where things get a little tougher.

271
00:24:58,566 --> 00:25:03,765
But first, let me introduce you
to the home team!

272
00:25:16,637 --> 00:25:20,144
Those guys look like
they've got a bone to pick, huh, Scoob?

273
00:25:20,855 --> 00:25:24,176
Don't worry, gang. We can beat
those meatless gladiators.

274
00:25:24,575 --> 00:25:27,843
And now for the home team's mascot.

275
00:25:31,406 --> 00:25:33,556
The lion's got the Scooby Snacks!

276
00:25:33,937 --> 00:25:37,643
You know, for once, I'm not in the mood
for Scooby Snacks.

277
00:25:37,766 --> 00:25:39,358
Me neither!

278
00:25:44,875 --> 00:25:46,723
Yikes!

279
00:25:47,543 --> 00:25:50,332
- Good idea, Scooby!
- Come on, Shaggy!

280
00:25:57,606 --> 00:26:02,202
- Are you all right, Shaggy?
- Yeah. But I'm really tangled up.

281
00:26:06,326 --> 00:26:09,363
- A chariot.
- Good thinking, Scoob!

282
00:26:09,566 --> 00:26:10,919
Thank you.

283
00:26:12,486 --> 00:26:14,636
Faster, Scoob! Faster!

284
00:26:20,766 --> 00:26:23,644
Yikes! Like, hit the turbo, Scoob!

285
00:26:26,166 --> 00:26:30,478
Good work, guys! You handle the gladiators,
and we'll take care of this lion.

286
00:26:31,766 --> 00:26:34,599
How exactly are we going to do that?

287
00:26:34,846 --> 00:26:37,997
- Give me your jacket.
- But I just bought this.

288
00:26:38,206 --> 00:26:41,278
- Daphne!
- Oh, all right.

289
00:26:41,686 --> 00:26:42,835
Here.

290
00:26:43,766 --> 00:26:46,758
I know this isn't red,
but it'll have to do.

291
00:26:49,046 --> 00:26:50,718
<i>Toro! Toro!</i>

292
00:26:50,719 --> 00:26:51,719
Leo! Leo!

293
00:27:01,726 --> 00:27:03,205
Olé!

294
00:27:03,486 --> 00:27:06,603
- That was too close.
- I have an idea.

295
00:27:14,566 --> 00:27:15,885
Leo! Leo!

296
00:27:18,886 --> 00:27:20,239
Now!

297
00:27:23,246 --> 00:27:25,237
Way to go, girls!

298
00:27:26,246 --> 00:27:28,157
- Thanks.
- This will hold him.

299
00:27:30,286 --> 00:27:34,074
- That was very brave, Freddy.
- Thanks.

300
00:27:35,244 --> 00:27:37,463
Here's your jacket.

301
00:27:38,246 --> 00:27:41,522
Shaggy and Scooby need our help!
Come on!

302
00:27:56,326 --> 00:27:57,805
Zoinks!

303
00:28:04,606 --> 00:28:06,039
Good going, guys!

304
00:28:06,532 --> 00:28:08,863
Yeah, whatever.

305
00:28:09,485 --> 00:28:13,356
Keep those gladiators busy just a little
bit longer. I'll get the Scooby Snacks.

306
00:28:13,562 --> 00:28:16,541
- That's easy for you to say, man.
- Yeah!

307
00:28:16,726 --> 00:28:21,516
- Try to lead them up into the stands.
- I don't think we have the energy.

308
00:28:21,726 --> 00:28:24,081
But, maybe we do!

309
00:28:27,046 --> 00:28:29,799
- Here.
- What are we supposed to do with these?

310
00:28:30,262 --> 00:28:34,754
- Use them to pole-vault over the wall.
- Like, and then what?

311
00:28:35,011 --> 00:28:36,885
Never mind.

312
00:28:49,806 --> 00:28:52,843
Friends, Romans and spooky gladiators.

313
00:28:53,046 --> 00:28:56,004
All hail Emperor Scooby!

314
00:29:33,886 --> 00:29:35,842
So where are we now?

315
00:29:36,326 --> 00:29:40,319
- Looks like a jungle of some kind.
- It's gorgeous here.

316
00:29:40,526 --> 00:29:44,565
I'll say. This place beats
ancient Rome any day, eh, Scoob?

317
00:29:55,485 --> 00:29:57,485
Oh, no! This is a prehistoric jungle!

318
00:29:57,486 --> 00:30:02,435
I take back what I said.
Rome is lovely this time of year.

319
00:30:03,166 --> 00:30:04,884
Look over there!

320
00:30:14,366 --> 00:30:16,279
What's that?!

321
00:30:17,206 --> 00:30:20,004
How's this for a heavy hitter?

322
00:30:20,286 --> 00:30:23,039
Jinkies! He's riding a T. rex!

323
00:30:27,846 --> 00:30:31,759
Let's head for the trees.
It's too thick for them to follow.

324
00:30:48,366 --> 00:30:51,756
- That was a close one.
- They're doing pretty good so far.

325
00:30:52,324 --> 00:30:54,275
I'm wondering something here, fellas.

326
00:30:54,406 --> 00:30:57,684
Who activated that laser and sent
those poor kids into the game?

327
00:30:57,966 --> 00:31:00,639
Who knows? Could be anyone.

328
00:31:00,846 --> 00:31:04,964
Even someone in this very room.

329
00:31:10,006 --> 00:31:14,602
We hiked through miles of jungle
and still can't find the Scooby Snacks!

330
00:31:14,806 --> 00:31:18,799
We'd better, otherwise we'll
be stuck in this level forever.

331
00:31:19,006 --> 00:31:23,238
All I know is that this virus likes
to scare us in cyberspace...

332
00:31:23,486 --> 00:31:25,363
...as much as in the real world.

333
00:31:32,506 --> 00:31:37,358
Nice work, guys. Which one of you
did the drawing over there?

334
00:31:41,474 --> 00:31:42,718
- Not me.
- Not me.

335
00:31:43,163 --> 00:31:47,246
- It looks like a volcano.
- I wonder if it means anything.

336
00:31:47,966 --> 00:31:50,082
Oh, no! The fire's going out.

337
00:31:51,086 --> 00:31:52,917
It's gonna be dark in a few hours, too.

338
00:31:53,126 --> 00:31:56,755
Scooby and Shaggy, it's your turn
to get the firewood.

339
00:31:58,046 --> 00:32:01,243
- All right. Come on, Scoob.
- Okay.

340
00:32:05,163 --> 00:32:08,426
Like, just a few more sticks,
and we can head back, Scoob.

341
00:32:11,632 --> 00:32:13,045
- Smoke!
- Smoke?

342
00:32:13,166 --> 00:32:18,035
Zoinks! Up there!
Like, all the trees are burning!

343
00:32:20,732 --> 00:32:23,436
Like, where did that come from?

344
00:32:24,784 --> 00:32:26,041
Volcano.

345
00:32:30,758 --> 00:32:35,174
Forget the wood, Scoob.
We've gotta warn the others.

346
00:32:40,046 --> 00:32:43,004
What happened, guys?
Where's the firewood?

347
00:32:43,206 --> 00:32:47,358
Like, if we don't get out of here soon,
we're all gonna be firewood.

348
00:32:47,642 --> 00:32:50,374
- What are you talking about, Shaggy?
- Volcano!

349
00:32:50,526 --> 00:32:52,278
Volcano?

350
00:32:56,286 --> 00:32:59,084
Great! It looks like
it's really cooking.

351
00:33:02,643 --> 00:33:06,521
I bet that's where
the Scooby Snacks are.

352
00:33:06,606 --> 00:33:09,803
That drawing is a clue
to lead us to the Scooby Snacks!

353
00:33:10,006 --> 00:33:13,396
But it's miles away.
It'll take us hours to get there!

354
00:33:13,606 --> 00:33:17,076
- Where there's a will, there's...
- Woolly mammoths?

355
00:33:22,566 --> 00:33:26,798
Mammoths didn't live in the same
age as dinosaurs, but I'm not complaining!

356
00:33:27,006 --> 00:33:30,681
I am! I wish Eric had put
saddles on these guys.

357
00:33:30,886 --> 00:33:32,877
I can't take much more of this.

358
00:33:33,345 --> 00:33:36,244
I wish he'd made them
smell better too.

359
00:33:37,086 --> 00:33:42,080
- How are you guys doing?
- Like, do you have an airsickness bag?

360
00:33:45,361 --> 00:33:48,783
Well, hang on, guys.
We're almost there.

361
00:33:59,846 --> 00:34:04,078
- Any sign of the Scooby Snacks?
- Like, all I can see is smoke.

362
00:34:04,286 --> 00:34:05,639
And lava!

363
00:34:10,351 --> 00:34:13,012
Look up there!

364
00:34:13,566 --> 00:34:17,764
- That poor baby pterodactyl's trapped.
- Poor little guy.

365
00:34:18,886 --> 00:34:23,721
- The volcano's erupting again.
- No. We've got company!

366
00:34:29,744 --> 00:34:31,553
Start climbing!

367
00:34:35,646 --> 00:34:37,284
Yikes!

368
00:34:53,076 --> 00:34:57,183
I think we're safe. T. rex is built
for running, not climbing.

369
00:35:00,846 --> 00:35:04,555
Look! The mama pterodactyl
is trying to save its baby.

370
00:35:07,784 --> 00:35:11,846
- Hey! Where are you going, Scoob?
- Be careful, Scooby!

371
00:35:17,486 --> 00:35:19,078
Hello!

372
00:35:33,486 --> 00:35:34,601
Scooby Snacks!

373
00:35:45,537 --> 00:35:47,778
He found the Scooby Snacks!

374
00:38:29,806 --> 00:38:32,274
I think we're finally home.

375
00:38:32,846 --> 00:38:36,998
No more monsters chasing us.
Let's celebrate with some chow.

376
00:38:39,726 --> 00:38:43,133
It might be a little early
for a celebration, gang.

377
00:38:43,454 --> 00:38:44,577
Look.

378
00:38:45,846 --> 00:38:48,679
Aw, man, we're still in the game.

379
00:38:48,886 --> 00:38:51,798
And I thought we were home free.

380
00:38:52,566 --> 00:38:54,841
Okay. They've made it to the last level.

381
00:38:55,086 --> 00:38:59,204
But this one's the toughest of all.
No player's ever won it. Not even me.

382
00:38:59,846 --> 00:39:02,360
It'll take everything they've got
just to survive.

383
00:39:04,006 --> 00:39:04,995
So now what?

384
00:39:05,055 --> 00:39:07,823
All we have to do is find
the last box of Scooby Snacks.

385
00:39:07,926 --> 00:39:11,475
But this city is so big.
Where do we start?

386
00:39:13,086 --> 00:39:15,725
Let's see if that woman
knows anything.

387
00:39:20,553 --> 00:39:24,126
- Excuse us, ma'am, we were wondering...
- Surprise!

388
00:39:25,573 --> 00:39:29,245
- The virus!
- Welcome to the final level.

389
00:39:29,447 --> 00:39:32,674
You're in the major leagues now.

390
00:39:33,366 --> 00:39:35,561
Run!

391
00:39:39,863 --> 00:39:43,985
- Like, where are we going?
- Hey, let's hide in the malt shop.

392
00:39:44,020 --> 00:39:45,122
Great idea, Freddy!

393
00:39:50,926 --> 00:39:52,757
Can someone help us?

394
00:39:56,406 --> 00:39:57,395
Zoinks!

395
00:39:57,606 --> 00:40:01,155
- You're me.
- And, like, you're me.

396
00:40:04,347 --> 00:40:08,518
- You're the characters in Eric's video game!
- And you're from the real world.

397
00:40:08,606 --> 00:40:10,244
Jinkies!

398
00:40:12,753 --> 00:40:15,034
Did I really wear that years ago?

399
00:40:15,256 --> 00:40:18,363
That jacket with that skirt?

400
00:40:20,806 --> 00:40:23,764
- Nice ascot.
- Works for me.

401
00:40:45,744 --> 00:40:50,273
I guess it's been a while since we've seen Eric.
He hasn't seen our fashion changes.

402
00:40:50,864 --> 00:40:54,142
- We'll go shopping later.
- Like, why don't you join us for a little snack?

403
00:40:54,206 --> 00:40:56,436
Man, I thought you'd never ask!

404
00:40:22,673 --> 00:40:24,902
Here you go, pal.

405
00:40:24,937 --> 00:40:27,132
Thanks a lot.

406
00:41:39,774 --> 00:41:44,356
We don't have time to play around. We need
to find the Scooby Snacks and get out of here.

407
00:41:44,653 --> 00:41:47,356
- You guys need to relax.
- Yeah! What are you worried about?

408
00:41:47,446 --> 00:41:49,357
Aren't you afraid
of the Phantom Virus?

409
00:41:49,566 --> 00:41:51,761
Phantom who?
Never heard of him.

410
00:41:51,966 --> 00:41:54,924
- You're kidding.
- Oh, I get it.

411
00:41:55,126 --> 00:41:57,401
The virus isn't part of this game.

412
00:41:57,606 --> 00:42:00,325
He has no reason to look
for our cyber doubles.

413
00:42:00,526 --> 00:42:02,676
You cyber-guys are lucky.

414
00:42:02,886 --> 00:42:07,323
The Phantom Virus is creepy
and has this really scary laugh.

415
00:42:09,832 --> 00:42:11,231
Just like that.

416
00:42:11,432 --> 00:42:13,741
Come out and play!

417
00:42:19,552 --> 00:42:20,541
It's him!

418
00:42:20,752 --> 00:42:22,947
Come out, come out.

419
00:42:25,792 --> 00:42:28,864
Let's get out of here.
The Mystery Machine's out back.

420
00:42:29,112 --> 00:42:30,591
- I'll drive.
- I'll drive.

421
00:42:34,712 --> 00:42:37,943
This is nostalgic.
I miss this old van.

422
00:42:38,467 --> 00:42:41,645
In cyber-world,
things never get old. It's pretty cool.

423
00:42:41,792 --> 00:42:49,445
There's a lot to like in cyber-world.
Stores, theaters, parks... and lots of tasty food.

424
00:42:50,512 --> 00:42:52,946
What about the monsters and villains?

425
00:42:53,152 --> 00:42:57,111
We haven't seen any.
They're probably guarding the Scooby Snacks.

426
00:42:57,312 --> 00:42:59,985
You mean you guys don't know
where the Scooby Snacks are?

427
00:43:00,245 --> 00:43:04,623
We know where they are. There's just
no reason to go after them.

428
00:43:04,712 --> 00:43:09,661
Because even if we get the Scooby Snacks,
we just go right back to the beginning of the game.

429
00:43:09,853 --> 00:43:11,315
And we like it here.

430
00:43:11,472 --> 00:43:15,351
Until you guys showed up
with that Phantom Virus, that is.

431
00:43:15,552 --> 00:43:18,703
- We'd gladly get rid of him for you.
- If we could.

432
00:43:18,912 --> 00:43:21,221
You know,
if all ten of us team up...

433
00:43:21,432 --> 00:43:24,151
...the Phantom Virus
wouldn't stand a chance.

434
00:43:26,832 --> 00:43:30,222
I guess we were gonna go
after the snacks eventually.

435
00:43:30,432 --> 00:43:32,468
- So you'll help?
- Count us in.

436
00:43:32,872 --> 00:43:35,181
Well then, let's go.

437
00:43:45,952 --> 00:43:48,068
Well, here we are.

438
00:43:57,552 --> 00:43:59,907
Man, this place is awesome!

439
00:44:00,512 --> 00:44:02,980
So where are the Scooby Snacks?

440
00:44:03,372 --> 00:44:07,734
On the Scooby game, of course.
Right inside the video arcade.

441
00:44:08,712 --> 00:44:10,270
What's that sound?

442
00:44:11,072 --> 00:44:12,903
There it is again.

443
00:44:13,512 --> 00:44:16,265
- Baseball.
- Cyber-Scooby is right.

444
00:44:16,472 --> 00:44:18,269
There's a batting cage over there.

445
00:44:23,673 --> 00:44:26,015
Wow, that guy is really
clobbering the ball.

446
00:44:26,192 --> 00:44:28,387
Hey, man. Great swing.

447
00:44:28,672 --> 00:44:31,391
Thanks! Want my autograph?

448
00:44:33,072 --> 00:44:35,586
Let's play ball!

449
00:44:38,912 --> 00:44:41,745
Everybody make a run
for the video arcade!

450
00:44:47,272 --> 00:44:50,184
Creeper!

451
00:44:52,952 --> 00:44:56,262
- Jeepers! It's the Creeper!
- The what?

452
00:44:56,472 --> 00:45:00,863
- He's one of the villains from our past.
- And he's got a pet.

453
00:45:04,637 --> 00:45:08,145
It's Jaguaro.
He's supposed to be in Brazil.

454
00:45:14,832 --> 00:45:17,027
Gator Ghoul and the Tar Monster?

455
00:45:20,552 --> 00:45:21,985
Head for the beach!

456
00:45:25,192 --> 00:45:27,342
No way. Look!

457
00:45:29,462 --> 00:45:31,237
It's Old Iron Face!

458
00:45:36,834 --> 00:45:39,344
Man, you guys know
some strange people.

459
00:45:39,643 --> 00:45:41,753
It's like every villain
we've ever faced is here!

460
00:45:41,952 --> 00:45:45,467
Maybe we shouldn't have told Eric
so much about our mysteries.

461
00:45:45,672 --> 00:45:48,869
How right you are, my dear.

462
00:46:04,032 --> 00:46:05,181
Wait a minute.

463
00:46:05,392 --> 00:46:09,988
All these creatures in the real world
turned out to be just people in costumes.

464
00:46:10,192 --> 00:46:13,104
Velma's right. They were all fakes.

465
00:46:13,592 --> 00:46:16,902
Nice try, Phantom Virus.
But you can't fool us.

466
00:46:30,432 --> 00:46:32,582
Tough time with the mask, guys?

467
00:46:32,912 --> 00:46:35,267
He's real!

468
00:46:38,272 --> 00:46:41,344
That means that they're all real!

469
00:46:46,632 --> 00:46:49,066
Creeper!

470
00:46:49,632 --> 00:46:51,588
Yikes!

471
00:47:01,352 --> 00:47:02,580
Get them!

472
00:47:03,072 --> 00:47:04,471
Let's split up, gang.

473
00:47:04,672 --> 00:47:06,390
- Right.
- Okay, Freddy.

474
00:47:14,672 --> 00:47:18,062
Step right up and test your strength.

475
00:47:19,192 --> 00:47:21,752
How about you, handsome?

476
00:47:22,853 --> 00:47:25,263
- Me?
- Yes, you, sir!

477
00:47:25,432 --> 00:47:28,035
Let us show you how easy it is.

478
00:47:32,792 --> 00:47:35,989
Creepy. Why'd you pick
this place to hide?

479
00:47:36,192 --> 00:47:38,228
Me? I was following you.

480
00:47:38,673 --> 00:47:42,844
If you thought this wasn't a good place,
you should've said something.

481
00:47:44,653 --> 00:47:46,230
Where did that come from?

482
00:47:46,536 --> 00:47:48,895
These fun houses have
all sorts of trap doors.

483
00:47:52,272 --> 00:47:54,866
Let's keep an eye open for more.

484
00:47:59,912 --> 00:48:01,504
Oh, no!

485
00:48:03,253 --> 00:48:04,505
What's wrong?

486
00:48:05,552 --> 00:48:09,545
- Look how fat I am!
- It's just a trick mirror.

487
00:48:10,032 --> 00:48:13,423
- You look perfect.
- Oh, thanks. You too.

488
00:48:15,512 --> 00:48:17,389
Creeper!

489
00:48:22,712 --> 00:48:25,863
- Keep away from us!
- What do we do?

490
00:48:31,352 --> 00:48:33,582
Sorry. You're not our type.

491
00:48:36,992 --> 00:48:38,710
Creeper.

492
00:48:40,552 --> 00:48:42,747
Way to go, girl!

493
00:48:46,754 --> 00:48:48,363
He's climbing back up!

494
00:48:53,963 --> 00:48:56,749
That door won't hold him long.

495
00:48:57,672 --> 00:48:59,121
Hey! Where are you?

496
00:48:59,312 --> 00:49:00,825
Come on!

497
00:49:05,152 --> 00:49:08,324
- Is he still behind us?
- Yep.

498
00:49:11,152 --> 00:49:14,303
That walking handbag
will reach us any minute now.

499
00:49:21,512 --> 00:49:22,706
Look!

500
00:49:27,312 --> 00:49:29,951
- What do we do now?
- Jump!

501
00:49:30,192 --> 00:49:34,470
- What?! We must be five stories high!
- Down there!

502
00:49:36,912 --> 00:49:40,348
One, two, three. Go!

503
00:49:48,512 --> 00:49:50,230
That was some jump.

504
00:49:52,792 --> 00:49:55,590
But it beats getting eaten
by an alligator.

505
00:49:55,792 --> 00:49:57,271
Just barely.

506
00:50:03,152 --> 00:50:05,871
See you later, alligator!

507
00:50:06,552 --> 00:50:10,909
- These wax figures are pretty creepy.
- At least they're not real.

508
00:50:14,792 --> 00:50:16,066
Hey, what's that?

509
00:50:16,542 --> 00:50:19,124
This must be where
they make the wax figurines.

510
00:50:19,232 --> 00:50:21,324
That one looks like...

511
00:50:22,312 --> 00:50:25,384
Old Iron Face! Jinkies!

512
00:50:25,592 --> 00:50:27,628
Let's get out of here.

513
00:50:27,629 --> 00:50:28,629
- Oh, no! My glasses!
- Mine too!

514
00:50:42,312 --> 00:50:43,791
- Thanks.
- Thanks.

515
00:50:51,352 --> 00:50:55,789
The wax is hardening. He can't move.

516
00:50:57,112 --> 00:51:00,661
Yes, he can. Let's get out of here!

517
00:51:50,232 --> 00:51:51,984
Great work, Scoobs.

518
00:51:56,712 --> 00:51:58,907
Don't be scared. It's just us.

519
00:52:05,192 --> 00:52:07,148
I thought we lost him.

520
00:52:21,392 --> 00:52:22,905
Go, Shaggys!

521
00:52:23,192 --> 00:52:27,822
- The Tar Monster is right behind us.
- And boy, is he mad!

522
00:52:30,032 --> 00:52:31,431
Let's get out of here!

523
00:55:07,357 --> 00:55:09,442
Look.

524
00:55:21,392 --> 00:55:23,348
- Bye-bye!
- Bye-bye!

525
00:55:32,672 --> 00:55:35,550
- Scooby-Doos!
- Where are you?

526
00:55:35,792 --> 00:55:37,350
I wonder where they are.

527
00:55:37,632 --> 00:55:40,100
- Over here.
- There they are!

528
00:55:40,312 --> 00:55:42,143
Come on, Scooby.

529
00:55:47,844 --> 00:55:50,973
Now that we're all here,
we've got one last monster to face.

530
00:55:51,592 --> 00:55:53,583
The Phantom Virus.

531
00:55:53,784 --> 00:55:56,856
And this is the final level,
so the virus won't be easy to beat.

532
00:55:57,753 --> 00:55:59,911
What's this? Zoinks!

533
00:55:59,912 --> 00:56:02,221
I've still got the magnet
Professor Kaufman gave me.

534
00:56:02,424 --> 00:56:06,683
You had that magnet with you
all this time and forgot about it?

535
00:56:06,912 --> 00:56:09,267
Guess I was too busy being scared.

536
00:56:11,152 --> 00:56:12,904
What's wrong with cyber-Shag?

537
00:56:21,576 --> 00:56:23,214
What's going on here?

538
00:56:23,352 --> 00:56:28,551
The cyber-gang is made of electromagnetic energy
and therefore affected by the magnet.

539
00:56:28,653 --> 00:56:30,534
Just like the Phantom Virus.

540
00:56:32,832 --> 00:56:37,144
- What's this about a magnet?
- We have a way to beat the virus now.

541
00:56:37,352 --> 00:56:41,061
And we know he's guarding
the Scooby Snacks in there.

542
00:56:43,632 --> 00:56:47,068
- We need your gang to stay here.
- You don't want us help to help you?

543
00:56:47,312 --> 00:56:49,826
We wouldn't want you
to get hurt by the magnet again.

544
00:56:49,984 --> 00:56:53,875
- Magnet? What are you talking about?
- Oh, never mind.

545
00:56:59,352 --> 00:57:03,061
Man, this is one great video arcade.

546
00:57:05,712 --> 00:57:10,911
- Just keep an eye open for the virus.
- Look. There's the Scooby-Doo video game.

547
00:57:11,232 --> 00:57:16,226
- And the Scooby Snacks!
- Oh, boy! Scooby Snacks!

548
00:57:17,952 --> 00:57:19,226
Yikes!

549
00:57:24,352 --> 00:57:27,549
Like, I hear him, but I don't see him.

550
00:57:34,632 --> 00:57:37,465
Ready to play some games?

551
00:57:46,252 --> 00:57:48,151
Shaggy, the magnet!

552
00:57:49,392 --> 00:57:50,950
Oh, right!

553
00:57:53,072 --> 00:57:57,384
- You need to get closer!
- Like, that's easy for you to say.

554
00:57:57,454 --> 00:58:02,143
- Then toss the magnet over here.
- With pleasure.

555
00:58:03,392 --> 00:58:04,984
Hey, Mr. Zappy!

556
00:58:10,152 --> 00:58:13,189
It's working! Scooby, go grab the snacks.

557
00:58:13,392 --> 00:58:14,381
Okay.

558
00:58:17,753 --> 00:58:21,215
Hurry, Scooby! I don't know how much
longer this is gonna work!

559
00:58:27,745 --> 00:58:28,864
Oh, no!

560
00:58:29,243 --> 00:58:31,384
Oh, tough break.

561
00:58:37,856 --> 00:58:39,116
- Freddy!
- Freddy!

562
00:58:45,752 --> 00:58:47,708
Not again!

563
00:58:57,272 --> 00:58:59,740
If you thought my hitting was good...

564
00:58:59,952 --> 00:59:02,591
...wait till you see my pitching.

565
00:59:08,232 --> 00:59:10,382
What do we do now?

566
00:59:12,764 --> 00:59:16,674
- Looks like they're in trouble!
- Like, we've gotta do something.

567
00:59:16,832 --> 00:59:18,221
Right! Let's go help them.

568
00:59:23,712 --> 00:59:25,784
Oh, no! They're back!

569
00:59:32,385 --> 00:59:33,643
Oh, no!

570
00:59:48,672 --> 00:59:49,946
Scooby?

571
00:59:51,785 --> 00:59:53,968
- Cyber-Scooby?
- That's right!

572
00:59:54,432 --> 00:59:57,061
It's no use.
We need some wire cutters.

573
00:01:02,846 --> 00:01:05,975
- I got an idea. Want to help?
- Okay.

574
00:01:06,138 --> 00:01:08,035
Great. Here's the plan.

575
00:01:18,426 --> 01:00:19,864
Over here.

576
01:00:21,192 --> 01:00:23,245
What are you doing, Scooby?

577
01:00:28,832 --> 01:00:30,663
Scooby, get back here!

578
01:00:30,912 --> 01:00:33,949
You're down to your final out.

579
01:00:37,912 --> 01:00:41,029
I've never seen Scooby so brave.

580
01:00:41,272 --> 01:00:45,390
Oh, I get it! That's Cyber-Scooby.

581
01:00:45,674 --> 01:00:49,391
And that's old Scoob
going for the snacks.

582
01:00:49,472 --> 01:00:51,547
Meddling canine!

583
01:00:54,192 --> 01:00:55,181
Yikes!

584
01:00:57,632 --> 01:00:58,781
Help!

585
01:01:10,872 --> 01:01:12,669
All right, Scoob!

586
01:01:36,152 --> 01:01:39,542
You did it!
You beat the Phantom Virus.

587
01:01:40,352 --> 01:01:41,844
Great job, guys!

588
01:01:51,552 --> 01:01:53,065
It looks like we're leaving.

589
01:01:55,672 --> 01:02:00,462
Are you sure you want to split?
There's a lot of cyber-buffets to try.

590
01:02:00,672 --> 01:02:02,902
Yeah! Okay!

591
01:02:03,152 --> 01:02:05,507
Sorry, but we have to go.

592
01:02:09,512 --> 01:02:13,107
- I guess this is goodbye.
- Bye!

593
01:02:13,392 --> 01:02:15,110
Thanks for all the help!

594
01:02:24,152 --> 01:02:25,710
Bye, Scooby.

595
01:02:38,752 --> 01:02:42,665
You're back! I thought you'd be
stuck in the game forever.

596
01:02:42,872 --> 01:02:44,908
There's no place like home.

597
01:02:45,792 --> 01:02:48,386
- Everyone okay?
- I think so.

598
01:02:48,573 --> 01:02:53,058
Well done! You've saved the world
from a terrible menace.

599
01:02:53,232 --> 01:02:57,387
- But did you find out who created the virus?
- We've got a pretty good idea.

600
01:02:57,564 --> 01:03:02,342
Good. Because whoever created
the virus must be punished.

601
01:03:02,527 --> 01:03:06,876
Glad you agree, Professor, because you're
as much a suspect as anyone here.

602
01:03:06,953 --> 01:03:09,679
What? Me? But I'm a scientist!

603
01:03:09,829 --> 01:03:13,344
I've dedicated my life
to my students and this university.

604
01:03:13,549 --> 01:03:17,178
But you also stood to make $250,000
at the science fair.

605
01:03:17,356 --> 01:03:19,674
If you stole the invention.

606
01:03:19,709 --> 01:03:21,028
Preposterous!

607
01:03:21,269 --> 01:03:24,227
And let's not forget Officer Wembley.

608
01:03:24,429 --> 01:03:28,547
What? I'm an officer
of the law! Sort of.

609
01:03:28,749 --> 01:03:31,946
Anyway, I've never committed
a crime in my life!

610
01:03:32,189 --> 01:03:36,501
You were the only person that was with us
in the lab when we got sent into the game.

611
01:03:36,644 --> 01:03:40,745
But once inside the game,
we found some important clues.

612
01:03:40,769 --> 01:03:45,259
Our first clue came when we were on the moon level.
The Phantom Virus shouted, "Play ball! "

613
01:03:45,469 --> 01:03:49,985
And on the Colosseum level, we found some
chalk lines like a large diamond.

614
01:03:50,189 --> 01:03:52,942
But our biggest clue
was on the final level.

615
01:03:53,189 --> 01:03:56,306
When the Phantom Virus
appeared in a batting cage.

616
01:03:56,446 --> 01:04:00,543
All I'm getting is that the virus
had a thing for... Baseball!

617
01:04:00,869 --> 01:04:02,063
Bill!

618
01:04:02,309 --> 01:04:04,539
Not so fast, kid!

619
01:04:17,896 --> 01:04:20,754
Okay, son, it's all over.

620
01:04:21,989 --> 01:04:25,664
- Bill, you were my best friend.
- And my best student.

621
01:04:25,665 --> 01:04:26,665
- But you didn't pick my project.
- What's that supposed to mean?

622
01:04:29,149 --> 01:04:34,223
Professor Kaufman chose your video design
over mine even though I've been here 2 years longer.

623
01:04:34,429 --> 01:04:36,784
Students are all equal, Bill.

624
01:04:37,029 --> 01:04:41,898
So you invented the Phantom Virus,
hoping it would scare Eric away.

625
01:04:42,048 --> 01:04:45,844
That's right. And it worked,
till you guys showed up.

626
01:04:45,949 --> 01:04:49,339
You were afraid that we would find out
who created the virus.

627
01:04:49,549 --> 01:04:52,109
So you beamed us into cyberspace.

628
01:04:52,463 --> 01:04:55,374
The prize would've been all mine,
if it wasn't for...

629
01:04:55,549 --> 01:04:57,744
Us meddling kids!

630
01:05:02,309 --> 01:05:06,268
I want to thank you for getting rid
of the Phantom Virus. Lunch is on me, guys.

631
01:05:06,549 --> 01:05:11,669
- In that case, I'll have another cheeseburger.
- Two cheeseburgers!

632
01:05:11,869 --> 01:05:12,904
No problem.

633
01:05:13,149 --> 01:05:15,663
I'm sorry you guys got trapped
in cyberspace.

634
01:05:15,989 --> 01:05:18,822
- Well, it really wasn't all that bad.
- Really?

635
01:05:19,029 --> 01:05:21,065
Going back in time was really fun.

636
01:05:21,309 --> 01:05:23,869
You did a great job
designing all the game levels.

637
01:05:23,985 --> 01:05:28,244
- Thanks, Daphne.
- But next time, go easier on the monsters.

638
01:05:31,245 --> 01:05:35,975
Hey, Shaggy, I just pulled up the Scooby-Doo
video game on my laptop. Want to play?

639
01:05:36,543 --> 01:05:38,064
What do you say, Scoob?

640
01:05:38,109 --> 01:05:41,499
Now that there's
no creepy virus in the game.

641
01:05:42,829 --> 01:05:45,468
Haven't you had enough for one day?

642
01:05:46,789 --> 01:05:48,780
Zoinks! Look!

643
01:05:53,509 --> 01:05:55,101
What are you doing, Scoob?

644
01:05:58,745 --> 01:06:01,214
Now that's what I call hacking!

645
01:06:01,429 --> 01:06:04,341
Hacking and Scooby-Snacking!

646
01:06:04,549 --> 01:06:07,586
Scooby-Dooby-Doo!

[ENGLISH]

649
01:09:22,749 --> 01:09:27,186
I may be a bit of a bookworm,
but I've got a wild side too.

650
01:09:27,315 --> 01:09:30,635
That's why my favorite part of the
<i>Scooby-Doo and the Cyber Chase</i>...

651
01:09:30,789 --> 01:09:36,022
...was shooting in the prehistoric jungle.
It brought out the animal in me.

652
01:09:39,789 --> 01:09:43,338
This one likes me.
Look how calm he is.

653
01:09:43,789 --> 01:09:45,108
Jinkies!

654
01:09:47,869 --> 01:09:48,938
Thanks, Scooby.

655
01:09:53,949 --> 01:09:56,622
Hey, Velma, that one likes you too.

656
01:09:58,155 --> 01:10:01,845
<i>Trying to tam those wolly mammoths
was like a prehistoric rodeo. </i>

657
01:10:02,144 --> 01:10:06,025
<i>Shaggy found out what
it was like to be a real cowpoke.</i>

658
01:10:06,389 --> 01:10:11,224
<i>And after a little practice, Scooby
and I started the first cattle drive. </i>

659
01:10:14,349 --> 01:10:17,659
My dream of playing
pro baseball ended pretty early.

660
01:10:17,869 --> 01:10:21,578
But another dream of mine came true
when we made the movie.

661
01:10:21,789 --> 01:10:24,622
Fred Jones, gladiator.

662
01:10:27,069 --> 01:10:32,063
- You look so cute in that outfit, Freddy.
- Cute? That's not what I was going for.

663
01:10:35,349 --> 01:10:37,101
You can beat him, Fred!

664
01:10:41,648 --> 01:10:44,983
All that Frisbee-playing
with Shaggy really paid off.

665
01:10:46,454 --> 01:10:48,975
I was amazed how acting like
Shaggy helped me during battle.

666
01:10:49,172 --> 01:10:53,847
I lured my opponents into traps,
jumped high when I was scared...

667
01:10:54,189 --> 01:10:57,545
...and most importantly,
ran really fast.

668
01:10:57,546 --> 01:10:58,546
Just because I wear nice clothes
and like to shop...

669
01:11:00,977 --> 01:11:02,746
doesn't mean I don't have
a sense of adventure.

670
01:11:02,989 --> 01:11:05,583
That's why I enjoyed
shooting at the North Pole.

671
01:11:05,894 --> 01:11:09,136
Besides, when it's 40 below,
no one cares what you're wearing.

672
01:11:09,469 --> 01:11:14,179
- The air is so cold.
- You gotta keep moving around.

673
01:11:14,469 --> 01:11:19,347
- Shaggy and Scooby have the right idea.
- They're doing Arctic aerobics.

674
01:11:19,869 --> 01:11:21,188
Like, help!

675
01:11:27,189 --> 01:11:32,040
- Nice work, Daphne.
- Now you know why I accessorize.

676
01:11:32,469 --> 01:11:36,257
If you're exploring the Arctic,
you need to make sacrifices.

677
01:11:36,509 --> 01:11:40,821
Your shelter must be practical,
you need to travel light...

678
01:11:41,484 --> 01:11:45,532
...and most importantly,
enjoy the 24 hours of sunlight.

679
01:11:46,509 --> 01:11:48,818
The part I enjoyed most
about this movie...

680
01:11:49,029 --> 01:11:52,180
...was all the time Scooby and I
got to spend at the arcade.

681
01:10:58,784 --> 01:11:00,849
Like, there's only one thing I love more
than playing games, and that's winning at 'em.

682
01:11:58,989 --> 01:12:00,945
One more point and I win.

683
01:12:04,349 --> 01:12:08,945
Game over, Scoob. Like, I'm the
air-hockey champion of the world!

684
01:12:15,109 --> 01:12:16,508
Two out of three?

685
01:12:17,593 --> 01:12:23,109
I could have been a better sport,
or at least not gotten so excited.

686
01:12:23,564 --> 01:12:26,325
But when I rubbed it in
after beating him at free throws...

687
01:12:26,509 --> 01:12:29,148
...Scooby made a winning shot
of his own.

688
01:12:29,349 --> 01:12:33,740
Your time, Scoob. What was your favorite part
of <i>Scooby-Doo and the Cyber Chase</i>?

689
01:12:34,149 --> 01:12:35,502
The laser.

690
01:12:37,467 --> 01:12:40,742
Like, I got it. Fire away, Scoob.

691
01:12:49,472 --> 01:12:53,229
Zoinks! It's amazing what you
can find on the Web. Eh, Scoob?

692
01:12:58,309 --> 01:13:01,269
We visited the
Scooby Snacks home page...

693
01:13:01,346 --> 01:13:03,680
...found a great Web site
for dessert...

694
01:13:03,809 --> 01:13:07,165
...which I found out
was spelled with two S's.

695
01:13:07,769 --> 01:13:11,148
And best of all, we got to see
an old friend, right, Scoob?

696
01:13:11,349 --> 01:13:14,386
Scooby-Dooby-Doo!
