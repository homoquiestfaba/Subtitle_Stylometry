00:16:17,409 --> 00:16:20,640
Most importantly...

176
00:16:20,713 --> 00:16:24,240
there has not always been
unity among the members.

177
00:16:24,316 --> 00:16:26,250
<i>Be careful.</i>

178
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:29,515
<i>Preservation of the List is everything.</i>
<i>Carpe diem.</i>

179
00:16:30,956 --> 00:16:33,049
Rice Planter's Inn, this weekend.

180
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:35,150
<i>Listen to me.</i>
<i>Listen to me!</i>

181
00:16:35,227 --> 00:16:37,889
I am holding in my hand,
as we speak...

182
00:16:37,963 --> 00:16:41,899
a letter from your bank giving me
full ownership of this account.

183
00:16:41,967 --> 00:16:45,869
Now you're telling me that without
this Desmond Larochette's signature...

184
00:16:45,938 --> 00:16:50,136
I can't get access
to my money? Really?

185
00:16:50,209 --> 00:16:52,700
Listen here.
I'm goin' out of town this weekend.

186
00:16:52,778 --> 00:16:55,542
Come Monday,
you better have <i>my</i> money.

187
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:07,583
No. Not again.

188
00:17:21,473 --> 00:17:24,306
Hi.
[Chattering]

189
00:17:25,978 --> 00:17:29,345
- Thanks.
- <i>[Bells Jingle]</i>

190
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:34,278
Can I help?

191
00:17:34,353 --> 00:17:36,617
No. Thank you.

192
00:17:36,688 --> 00:17:40,124
- Haven't I seen you before?
- Honestly, right now is really not the time.

193
00:17:40,192 --> 00:17:42,626
You were at St. Albans
Cemetery, right?

194
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:47,093
I was burying my father.

195
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:50,725
So was I.

196
00:17:54,173 --> 00:17:57,199
- How did you remember me?
- You were crying.

197
00:17:57,276 --> 00:17:59,210
I wasn't.

198
00:17:59,278 --> 00:18:02,543
- <i>[Dog Barking]</i>
- One of y'all need a tow?

199
00:18:02,614 --> 00:18:04,548
Yeah. I do. Hi.

200
00:18:04,616 --> 00:18:08,814
Uh, shop's right around the corner, baby.
You wanna ride over with me and Harold?

201
00:18:08,887 --> 00:18:10,548
- <i>[Harold Barks]</i>
- I can give you a lift.

202
00:18:10,622 --> 00:18:15,889
<i>Or at least allow me to wait with you,</i>
<i>make sure everything's okay.</i>

203
00:18:15,961 --> 00:18:18,293
Really, it's okay.
I think I'll just chance it with Harold.

204
00:18:18,363 --> 00:18:21,560
<i>How 'bout, uh, I buy you lunch?</i>

205
00:18:21,633 --> 00:18:25,399
Hey, uh-
Y'all can call my cell, right?

206
00:18:25,471 --> 00:18:27,939
- Yeah.
- How's that barbecue over there?

207
00:18:28,006 --> 00:18:31,737
The best pig in the county. Tell 'em I sent you,
they'll give you extra hush puppies.

208
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:35,803
- <i>Best pig in the whole county.</i>
- Sugar, you sure you don't want a ride?

209
00:18:35,881 --> 00:18:38,907
<i>We'll be in plain view</i>
<i>the whole way.</i>

210
00:18:40,752 --> 00:18:42,743
Promise.

211
00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:46,924
Renny Jacobson.

212
00:18:48,427 --> 00:18:50,361
Jo Johnston.

213
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:53,764
Pleased to meet you, Jo.

214
00:18:53,832 --> 00:18:57,165
<i>[Man On Radio: Country]</i>
<i>#And you shiver when the cold-#</i>

215
00:19:07,779 --> 00:19:09,770
I always thank God for barbecue.

216
00:19:09,848 --> 00:19:12,578
At this place,
you pray after you eat.

217
00:19:12,651 --> 00:19:15,279
[Laughing]

218
00:19:15,354 --> 00:19:19,120
- <i>Some more tea?</i>
- <i>Yeah. Please.</i>

219
00:19:19,191 --> 00:19:23,093
- <i>[Tea Pouring]</i>
- Mmm. Thank you. [Chuckles]

220
00:19:24,897 --> 00:19:28,389
- What was your father's name?
- Taylor.

221
00:19:28,467 --> 00:19:31,197
<i>Taylor Johnston.</i>

222
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:34,433
- <i>[Cell Phone Rings]</i>
- Harold.

223
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:37,907
Ooh. Thanks. Hello.

224
00:19:39,645 --> 00:19:41,579
[Sighs]

225
00:19:41,647 --> 00:19:43,581
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

226
00:19:45,817 --> 00:19:47,751
<i>Okay. Yeah.</i>

227
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:54,951
<i>Thank you. Yeah. Okay. Bye.</i>

228
00:19:57,229 --> 00:20:01,962
Unbelievable. I'm not going to know
anything until tomorrow.

229
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:06,494
Jo, are you going to
the Rice Planter's Inn?

230
00:20:06,572 --> 00:20:09,769
Jo Taylor Johnston?

231
00:20:11,376 --> 00:20:13,310
Yeah.

232
00:20:13,378 --> 00:20:18,042
Josiah Fletchall Jacobson.

233
00:20:27,526 --> 00:20:29,517
Let's make some arrangements.

234
00:20:29,595 --> 00:20:33,087
<i>I can bring you back</i>
<i>for your truck.</i>

235
00:20:43,041 --> 00:20:46,204
- Have you tried to get your money?
- Money?

236
00:20:49,348 --> 00:20:51,282
What money?

237
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:54,285
What did your father tell you?

238
00:20:54,353 --> 00:20:57,151
Nothing.
He left when I was a baby.

239
00:20:57,222 --> 00:21:00,555
I got a letter and that truck,
and you can see how that turned out.

240
00:21:00,626 --> 00:21:02,560
Well...

241
00:21:02,628 --> 00:21:07,031
figure over 140 years'
compound interest.

242
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:09,659
- Is this legitimate?
- [Chuckles]

243
00:21:09,735 --> 00:21:12,397
I'm a lawyer,
and I'm keepin' an open mind.

244
00:21:12,471 --> 00:21:14,405
Hmm.

245
00:21:17,009 --> 00:21:20,638
I just came here to find out
more about my father.

246
00:21:20,712 --> 00:21:23,510
- <i>[Engine Starts]</i>
- I know too much about my father.

247
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:40,863
[Both Chuckling]

248
00:21:40,932 --> 00:21:45,460
Which one doesn't belong?
Wow.

249
00:21:45,537 --> 00:21:47,835
<i>My mom's always been the volunteer.</i>

250
00:21:47,906 --> 00:21:51,239
She used to volunteer at the library,
and she also volunteered at the hospital...

251
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:54,211
so that kind of got me interested in medicine,
but I don't know.

252
00:21:54,279 --> 00:21:58,113
School's really expensive, so right now
I'm just taking the semester off...

253
00:21:58,183 --> 00:22:00,344
from nursing school
at Wake Forest.

254
00:22:00,419 --> 00:22:03,718
Hmm. How do you like
the South as opposed to Michigan?

255
00:22:03,789 --> 00:22:07,122
Um, well, when it's like this,
I like it a lot.

256
00:22:07,192 --> 00:22:09,990
You know, it's nice
not having as much snow.

257
00:22:10,062 --> 00:22:14,362
The people are friendlier,
at least when you first meet them.

258
00:22:14,433 --> 00:22:16,901
What about you?

259
00:22:16,968 --> 00:22:19,528
<i>Me? Well, uh-</i>

260
00:22:19,604 --> 00:22:22,732
For me the South is many things.

261
00:22:22,808 --> 00:22:27,370
It's, uh, live oaks
with long memories...

262
00:22:27,446 --> 00:22:30,415
<i>like the ones we passed</i>
<i>coming in here.</i>

263
00:22:30,482 --> 00:22:33,315
Azaleas in April.

264
00:22:33,385 --> 00:22:37,845
Novels, for sure, by Faulkner, Percy.

265
00:22:37,923 --> 00:22:40,756
Characters so real,
they remind me of my neighbors.

266
00:22:40,826 --> 00:22:42,760
[Chuckling]

267
00:22:42,828 --> 00:22:45,888
The sun rising over
the Ashley River...

268
00:22:45,964 --> 00:22:48,125
with the mist
comin' off the water.

269
00:22:49,768 --> 00:22:53,602
- And barbecue.
- [Laughing] Definitely the barbecue.

270
00:22:53,672 --> 00:22:55,799
[Renny]
Wow.

271
00:22:55,874 --> 00:22:58,502
Impressive, huh?

272
00:22:58,577 --> 00:23:01,444
- You ready for this, Jo?
- I guess.

273
00:23:06,485 --> 00:23:08,419
Good afternoon.

274
00:23:09,554 --> 00:23:12,682
Your father's room, Mr. Jacobson.

275
00:23:12,758 --> 00:23:16,592
Second floor,
turn right, third door on your left.

276
00:23:16,661 --> 00:23:19,562
And your father's room
is across the hall.

277
00:23:19,631 --> 00:23:21,826
<i>The meeting is in there.</i>

278
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:23,868
7:00.

279
00:23:23,935 --> 00:23:25,869
Thank you.

280
00:23:37,883 --> 00:23:39,817
Are you ready?

281
00:23:51,163 --> 00:23:54,223
- [Chattering]
- A woman!

282
00:23:54,299 --> 00:23:56,893
<i>[Chattering Stops]</i>

283
00:23:56,968 --> 00:24:01,337
<i>[Chuckling]</i>
<i>Well, we can see that, Gus.</i>

284
00:24:01,406 --> 00:24:04,375
You must be Josiah.
You have your father's eyes.

285
00:24:04,443 --> 00:24:07,935
- Desmond Larochette.
- People call me Renny.

286
00:24:08,013 --> 00:24:11,380
I bet they do.
And you are?

287
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:14,419
Jo Taylor Johnston.

288
00:24:14,486 --> 00:24:17,887
Jo. Ah.
Without an "E," I presume.

289
00:24:17,956 --> 00:24:21,619
[Kisses]
Mmm. Very nice to meet you.

290
00:24:21,693 --> 00:24:24,253
Uh-Well, gentlemen, please...

291
00:24:24,329 --> 00:24:26,354
introduce yourself to our guests.

292
00:24:26,431 --> 00:24:28,831
Mr. Jacobson, Miss Johnston.

293
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:31,494
Bart Maxwell.

294
00:24:31,570 --> 00:24:34,334
- Bart Maxwell.
- Renny Jacobson. Nice to meet you.

295
00:24:34,406 --> 00:24:36,340
- Thomas Layne.
- Michael Flournoy.

296
00:24:36,408 --> 00:24:38,433
- Nice to meet you.
- <i>Welcome.</i>

297
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:40,671
- Hey. I'm Gus Eicholtz.
- Hey. Renny Jacobson.

298
00:24:40,745 --> 00:24:43,578
Can I get y'all a drink?
Rather, two drinks.

299
00:24:43,648 --> 00:24:47,049
- Um, soda water, with lime, please.
- Yes, ma'am. You, sir?

300
00:24:47,118 --> 00:24:49,245
- Chivas, rocks.
- Comin' up.

301
00:24:51,656 --> 00:24:54,921
- Nervous?
- Not since the bar exam.

302
00:24:54,993 --> 00:24:59,657
You should've had Gus coach you.
He seems to know the bar very well.

303
00:24:59,731 --> 00:25:02,029
- Here you go.
- Oh. Thank you.

304
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:04,193
- Thank you.
- Who is that?

305
00:25:05,570 --> 00:25:08,539
That's John C. Calhoun...

306
00:25:08,607 --> 00:25:10,598
secretary of state under
William Henry Harrison.

307
00:25:10,675 --> 00:25:14,372
Enduring symbol of the old South.

308
00:25:14,446 --> 00:25:18,143
- Died in 1850.
- He looks mad.

309
00:25:18,216 --> 00:25:21,743
Not half as mad as he'd look
if he died in 1865.

310
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:26,154
<i>In these parts, when people talk about "the war,"</i>
<i>they mean the war between the states.</i>

311
00:25:26,224 --> 00:25:30,217
Or some of us down here call it
"the war of Northern aggression."

312
00:25:30,295 --> 00:25:34,288
- <i>[Jo Laughs]</i>
- Oh, come on now, Harry.

313
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:37,392
Hurts no one
to let her dine with us.

314
00:25:38,670 --> 00:25:41,002
What can you tell me
about my father?

315
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:45,070
He was a brilliant engineer.

316
00:25:45,143 --> 00:25:47,543
Could have designed
the Golden Gate.

317
00:25:47,612 --> 00:25:51,275
But every time I talked to him,
he was in a new town.

318
00:25:51,349 --> 00:25:55,410
At these things, he'd stay at the bar,
kept mostly to himself-

319
00:25:55,487 --> 00:25:58,650
especially about his family.

320
00:25:58,723 --> 00:26:01,351
Why would he keep me a secret?

321
00:26:01,426 --> 00:26:05,590
Dear heart, do you see
any other women here?

322
00:26:07,933 --> 00:26:11,130
- [Tone Ringing]
- Lady and gentlemen.

323
00:26:11,202 --> 00:26:13,864
<i>Would you please</i>
<i>take your places for dinner?</i>

324
00:26:13,939 --> 00:26:18,638
<i>We all have assigned seats.</i>
<i>Your family sits right over there, Miss Johnston.</i>

325
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:22,305
- This is your father's chair.
- Thank you.

326
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:26,316
I was, uh, sorry to hear about your father.
Where'd it happen?

327
00:26:26,384 --> 00:26:30,013
<i>He'd just double bogeyed number 17</i>
<i>on the links course at Wild Dunes.</i>

328
00:26:30,088 --> 00:26:34,388
- That hole almost killed me one time, remember?
- Yeah.

329
00:26:34,459 --> 00:26:36,450
<i>[Laughing]</i>

330
00:26:36,528 --> 00:26:41,192
Now, I'll give you the real introductions
to these people here.

331
00:26:41,266 --> 00:26:44,633
<i>Flournoy wishes he could put "count"</i>
<i>in front of his name.</i>

332
00:26:44,703 --> 00:26:47,866
<i>Roget there is Desmond's shadow.</i>

333
00:26:47,939 --> 00:26:51,397
Harry nurses his grudge
against Desmond.

334
00:26:51,476 --> 00:26:56,470
<i>Seems that Desmond's great-granddaddy</i>
<i>shot Harry's great-granddaddy...</i>

335
00:26:56,548 --> 00:26:59,312
in the kneecap with a Derringer.

336
00:27:01,052 --> 00:27:03,680
Do you like chateaubriand?

337
00:27:03,755 --> 00:27:06,383
- Yes, I do.
- Good.

338
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:08,926
Weiss-

339
00:27:08,994 --> 00:27:11,326
He's a bean counter from Virginia.

340
00:27:11,396 --> 00:27:15,662
<i>He looks tough, but he takes a bodyguard</i>

<i>he's not enjoying this evening.</i>

343
00:27:24,576 --> 00:27:27,909
He does not enjoy the controversy...

344
00:27:27,979 --> 00:27:30,880
<i>caused by Miss Johnston.</i>

345
00:27:30,949 --> 00:27:34,407
<i>And unless he can pull</i>
<i>a Strom Thurmond...</i>

346
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:37,046
he'll die without an heir.

347
00:27:37,122 --> 00:27:39,215
Of course, Thomas here...

348

349
00:27:41,793 --> 00:27:44,455
Absolutely.

350
00:27:44,529 --> 00:27:46,724
And poor Bart Maxwell.

351
00:27:46,798 --> 00:27:50,461
<i>Getting married in two weeks.</i>
<i>Gonna lose his freedom.</i>

352

354
00:27:58,576 --> 00:28:01,943
<i>Miss Johnston,</i>
<i>your presence here tonight...</i>

355
00:28:02,013 --> 00:28:04,379
presents us with quite a dilemma.

356
00:28:04,449 --> 00:28:06,781
I'm sure you can appreciate that.

357
00:28:06,851 --> 00:28:09,547
Now, I've spoken to Harry here...

358
00:28:09,621 --> 00:28:12,818
and we believe the issue
should be discussed by all the members...

359
00:28:12,891 --> 00:28:15,086
<i>in your absence.</i>

360
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:17,390
<i>As for Mr. Jacobson...</i>

361
00:28:17,462 --> 00:28:20,989
<i>why, I see no reason why he shouldn't</i>
<i>be part of these discussions.</i>

362
00:28:21,066 --> 00:28:24,126
<i>Is that fair,</i>
<i>to put him in that position?</i>

363
00:28:24,202 --> 00:28:26,397
I have no problem
with him staying.

364
00:28:26,471 --> 00:28:30,237
- Well, I do.
- <i>[Desmond] All right. Let's put it to the vote.</i>

365
00:28:30,308 --> 00:28:32,902
<i>I shall abstain.</i>

366
00:28:32,977 --> 00:28:36,140
All those in favor of Mr. Jacobson
leaving the room...

367
00:28:36,214 --> 00:28:39,240
while Miss Johnston's
status is discussed...

368
00:28:39,317 --> 00:28:41,308
please raise your right hand.

369
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:47,385
Harry, Robert, Michael.
Anyone else- Jerrod.

370
00:28:47,459 --> 00:28:51,555
That's four to three.
Majority rules.

371
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:05,002
They seem harmless enough.

372
00:29:05,076 --> 00:29:07,067
I'm sure you'll get in.

373
00:29:07,145 --> 00:29:09,306
I'm not sure I want <i>in.</i>

374
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:12,042
- What?
- I don't know, Renny. Come on.

375
00:29:12,117 --> 00:29:15,280
It's like secret societies
and blood oaths.

376
00:29:15,353 --> 00:29:18,345
These aren't little kids.
They're grown men. It feels weird.

377
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:21,756
Just play along, Jo.
Think about the money.

Uh, nevertheless,
there's something to be said...

383
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:44,214
for tradition.

384
00:29:44,282 --> 00:29:46,944

392
00:30:12,110 --> 00:30:14,578
I want to know more
about my father.

393
00:30:14,646 --> 00:30:19,174
<i>Uh, we don't socialize very much,</i>
<i>Miss Johnston.</i>

394
00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:22,219
- It's a business partnership.
- <i>So you don't know anything.</i>

395
00:30:23,988 --> 00:30:27,890
My father left me a letter blaming
this group for the way his life turned out.

396
00:30:27,959 --> 00:30:31,725
Every old Southern family
has its share of, um, lunatics...

- Wait a minute.

00:30:50,181 --> 00:30:54,140
- <i>What about her money?</i>
- Participation in the List is for members only.

403
00:30:54,219 --> 00:30:57,211
<i>Even if she's out,</i>
<i>shouldn't she be paid for the past?</i>

404
00:30:57,288 --> 00:31:00,883
<i>That's her father's responsibility.</i>
<i>That's not ours.</i>

you wait here just a minute.

your father and I were fishing <i>off</i>

408
00:31:12,837 --> 00:31:15,965

washed me overboard.

409

Your father saved my life.

- Beautiful, huh?
- Yes, sir.

513
00:38:47,892 --> 00:38:51,794
Well, it's yours.
Welcome to the List, son.

514
00:38:51,862 --> 00:38:56,026
The title and a little gas money
in the envelope.

515
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:59,467
- Thank you, Mr. Larochette.
- Renny.

516
00:38:59,537 --> 00:39:03,098
I know your relationship
with your daddy wasn't the best.

517
00:39:04,675 --> 00:39:07,940
- He kind of had his own way.
- Yeah, he did.

518
00:39:08,012 --> 00:39:11,175
I know I didn't see eye to eye
with him either.

519
00:39:11,248 --> 00:39:15,241
I just want you to know
that I am here for you...

520
00:39:15,319 --> 00:39:17,651

521
00:39:17,722 --> 00:39:19,883
Thank you, sir.
I- I appreciate it.

522
00:39:19,957 --> 00:39:22,755
- Now, you drive safely.
- I will. Thank you.

523
00:39:32,737 --> 00:39:36,867
Well, looks like you got more
than a secret handshake.

524
00:39:36,941 --> 00:39:39,273
Just found out my transmission's
totally shot.

525
00:39:39,343 --> 00:39:41,277
Hmm.

526
00:39:43,881 --> 00:39:47,510
- Best I can do.
- Thank you.

527
00:39:47,585 --> 00:39:50,884
Ah, but wait.
You gave me the wrong set.

528
00:39:50,955 --> 00:39:52,980

<i>My grandfather owned several miles</i>
<i>of beach just north of here.</i>

531
00:40:12,176 --> 00:40:15,236
He sold it in the '20s.
Dumb move, huh?

532
00:40:15,312 --> 00:40:17,576
How can you own the beach?
Oh, wait.

533
00:40:17,648 --> 00:40:20,742
Then again, who needs beachfront property
when you're a member of the List?

534
00:40:20,818 --> 00:40:22,752
- Ah. Ha-ha.
- Ha-ha.

535
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:25,380
So what are you gonna do
with all your money anyway?

536
00:40:25,456 --> 00:40:28,289
[Sighs]
Get free. Quit the firm.

537
00:40:28,359 --> 00:40:31,692

lawyer number 104 out of 104...

538

on that letterhead.

539
00:40:33,831 --> 00:40:38,666
Then- I don't know.
I thought I might... write.

540
00:40:38,736 --> 00:40:42,194
Write? Hmm.
Any ideas?

541
00:40:42,273 --> 00:40:46,573
Somethin' important like, uh,
<i>The Yankees' Guide to Southern Barbecue.</i>

542

- I'm almost done with my research.

Oh, okay.

544
00:40:50,948 --> 00:40:54,042
Actually, I do have
an idea in mind.

545
00:40:54,118 --> 00:40:57,781
I've always been fascinated with the story
about a group of 10,000 Southerners...

546
00:40:57,855 --> 00:41:01,313
who pulled up and moved
to Brazil in 1867.

547
00:41:01,392 --> 00:41:04,225
- Really? I never heard that.
- Most people haven't.

548
00:41:04,295 --> 00:41:08,595
They, uh-They settled in the jungle
near São Paulo.

549
00:41:08,666 --> 00:41:10,657
That's amazing.

550
00:41:10,734 --> 00:41:13,703
Uh-And this is a true story?

551
00:41:13,771 --> 00:41:16,899

Their descendants still live there.

552
00:41:16,974 --> 00:41:19,772
- Well, what's it called?
- <i>Americana.</i>

553
00:41:19,844 --> 00:41:21,971
Hmm.

554
00:41:22,046 --> 00:41:24,446
Well, I think it's a great idea.

555
00:41:24,515 --> 00:41:27,177
You should do it,
no matter what happens.

556
00:41:29,019 --> 00:41:33,479
Junior year I told my father I was thinkin'
of changin' majors to English.

557
00:41:33,557 --> 00:41:35,718
- Hmm. What'd he say?
- [Laughs]

558
00:41:35,793 --> 00:41:37,852
- He made it easy for me.
- Uh-huh.

559
00:41:37,928 --> 00:41:41,091
Major in pre-law
or go on financial aid.

560
00:41:41,165 --> 00:41:46,125
Hmm. Well, I think you
should write it now.

561
00:41:46,203 --> 00:41:48,330
In fact, if you don't, I will.

- May I?
- Yeah.

566
00:42:00,451 --> 00:42:04,581
People comb this beach for years
and never find one like that.

567
00:42:04,655 --> 00:42:07,317
- So what's it worth?
- Well, nothing.

568
00:42:07,391 --> 00:42:09,951
You can buy one at any beach shop
for two bucks.

569
00:42:10,027 --> 00:42:13,394
Finding it yourself
is what makes it valuable.

to go kneel and pray
at that altar right there.

681
00:52:12,662 --> 00:52:16,359
You know, I should-
I should be leavin'.

682
00:52:18,335 --> 00:52:20,269
Hmm.

683
00:52:23,073 --> 00:52:25,405
I'll pray for your journey, son.

684
00:52:31,815 --> 00:52:34,079
How'd you know my name was...

685
00:52:35,619 --> 00:52:37,883
Josiah?

686
00:52:37,954 --> 00:52:39,751
Hello?

687
00:52:41,491 --> 00:52:43,425
Hello!

688
00:52:58,175 --> 00:53:00,905
- <i>[Jo] Hey.</i>
- Hey. Have you seen the caretaker?

689
00:53:02,379 --> 00:53:04,370
Was I supposed to?

690
00:53:05,582 --> 00:53:07,516
Question.

691
00:53:07,584 --> 00:53:10,917
Where can we find out
more about your family?

692
00:53:10,987 --> 00:53:12,921
<i>[Car Doors Closing]</i>

693
00:53:12,989 --> 00:53:15,457
She practically raised me.

694
00:53:15,525 --> 00:53:17,516
Gave me the name Renny.

695
00:53:17,594 --> 00:53:21,428
Said I pecked at my food
like a Carolina wren.

696
00:53:21,498 --> 00:53:24,296
- Mama A.
- [Laughing] Oh!

697
00:53:24,367 --> 00:53:26,528
[Laughing]
Mmm.

698
00:53:26,603 --> 00:53:29,265
- Mama A, this is Jo.
- Oh, hello, children!

699
00:53:29,339 --> 00:53:31,273
- Hi.
- Mmm.

700
00:53:32,275 --> 00:53:34,266
<i>[Mama A Laughing]</i>

701
00:53:40,717 --> 00:53:43,811
But you didn't come here for johnnycakes,
now, did you, boy?

702
00:53:48,425 --> 00:53:50,586
What can you tell us
about the Jacobsons?

703
00:53:55,031 --> 00:53:56,965
Sad tales.

704
00:53:59,936 --> 00:54:03,303
Well, you know,
the old-time Jacobson...

705
00:54:03,373 --> 00:54:06,035
the one that made it
through the war-

706
00:54:06,109 --> 00:54:09,340
- J.F.
- Jeremiah.

707
00:54:09,412 --> 00:54:13,314
Now, as I recall, he was a-
he was a rich planter before the war.

708
00:54:13,383 --> 00:54:15,317
Very successful.

709
00:54:17,487 --> 00:54:19,512
What became of him?

710
00:54:19,589 --> 00:54:21,682
Got himself killed in a bar fight.

711
00:54:23,326 --> 00:54:25,954
His son, Hiram, went crazy.

712
00:54:27,130 --> 00:54:29,257
Locked himself up in a room.

713
00:54:29,332 --> 00:54:32,062
Died from something
they used to call the apoplexy.

714
00:54:34,304 --> 00:54:36,738
- A stroke.
- <i>Mm-hmm.</i>

715
00:54:36,806 --> 00:54:41,766
<i>Now, I knew</i>
<i>your father's daddy personally-</i>

716
00:54:41,845 --> 00:54:43,813
who was one unhappy man.

717
00:54:43,880 --> 00:54:47,145
He was lost on his yacht
at sea, right?

718
00:54:48,652 --> 00:54:52,349
Left Charleston Harbor one bright,
sunny day and never come back.

719
00:54:52,422 --> 00:54:57,416
<i>After that, only your mama</i>
<i>could reach your daddy.</i>

720
00:54:57,494 --> 00:55:00,657
<i>Seemed like he was mad</i>
<i>at the whole wide world.</i>

721
00:55:02,932 --> 00:55:04,866
<i>And now him.</i>

722
00:55:06,102 --> 00:55:08,570
Ah, it's just-

723
00:55:08,638 --> 00:55:11,607
just a tragedy,
that whole Jacobson story.

724
00:55:14,811 --> 00:55:18,611
What about my mother's side,
the Candlers?

725
00:55:18,682 --> 00:55:21,913
Not so much money,
but a whole lot more happiness.

726
00:55:21,985 --> 00:55:25,148
I saw the Amos Candler monument.

727
00:55:25,221 --> 00:55:28,190
Hmm. Now, he was rich
before the war.

728
00:55:28,258 --> 00:55:31,750
By the time it got into
your mama's generation...

729
00:55:31,828 --> 00:55:34,388
all that money had done
gone with the wind.

730
00:55:34,464 --> 00:55:38,730
<i>What else do you know</i>
<i>about my mother's family?</i>

731
00:55:43,173 --> 00:55:45,767
Um, here.

732
00:55:45,842 --> 00:55:48,436
Your mama told me
one day you'd come here...

733
00:55:48,511 --> 00:55:51,275
lookin' for answers
about her family.

734
00:55:53,983 --> 00:55:56,315
And I knew today was that day.

735
00:55:58,922 --> 00:56:00,913
She wanted me to give you this.

736
00:56:07,864 --> 00:56:10,094
How did she know
I was goin' to ask?

737
00:56:10,166 --> 00:56:14,626
[Chuckles, Laughing]

738
00:56:16,639 --> 00:56:19,574
<i>[Laughing Continues]</i>

739
00:56:19,642 --> 00:56:22,440
<i>[Woman's Voice]</i>
<i>Dear Renny, I have said prayers for you...</i>

740
00:56:22,512 --> 00:56:25,811
<i>that I believe will be answered</i>
<i>after my death.</i>

741
00:56:25,882 --> 00:56:29,249
<i>The letter you hold in your hand</i>
<i>is one of them.</i>

742
00:56:29,319 --> 00:56:33,722
<i>Son, your life has</i>

743
00:56:34,891 --> 00:56:38,452
<i>When you were born,</i>
<i>I named you Josiah.</i>

744
00:56:38,528 --> 00:56:41,554
<i>Josiah was a king of Israel...</i>

745
00:56:41,631 --> 00:56:45,397
<i>a righteous man who confronted</i>
<i>an ancient evil.</i>

746
00:56:46,836 --> 00:56:50,636
<i>I know this may sound strange</i>
<i>and unusual to you...</i>

747
00:56:50,707 --> 00:56:54,268
<i>but I believe Josiah's call</i>
<i>is similar to your own.</i>

748
00:56:55,812 --> 00:56:58,713
<i>There is more to life</i>
<i>than we can see...</i>

<i>with our natural eyes...</i>

<i>All my love, Mother.</i>

00:57:11,628 --> 00:57:13,653
- Hey.
- Hey.

754
00:57:13,730 --> 00:57:16,631
Look, uh, today at the cemetery...

755
00:57:16,699 --> 00:57:19,327
I saw every List member
in my family...

756
00:57:19,402 --> 00:57:21,893
and they all died
really, really young, Renny.

757
00:57:21,971 --> 00:57:24,804
And just-
Will you look?

758
00:57:27,310 --> 00:57:30,040
And then-And then there were
all these- these baby crosses...

759
00:57:30,113 --> 00:57:32,104
and they're all over the place.

760
00:57:32,182 --> 00:57:34,912
I don't know, Jo, okay?
I just, uh-

761
00:57:34,984 --> 00:57:38,385
But think about it.
Your father, my father, Bart Maxwell.

762
00:57:38,455 --> 00:57:42,448
- Something's wrong.
- I hear you. I do.

763
00:57:47,897 --> 00:57:51,025
I know you need to get back
to Winston, Salem, but...

764
00:57:51,100 --> 00:57:53,500
<i>I was hoping maybe</i>
<i>you'd follow me to Charlotte.</i>

765
00:57:53,570 --> 00:57:56,334
I'd really like to introduce you
to my landlady, Mrs. Stokes.

- <i>It's fine. She reminds me of Mama A.</i>
- Yeah.

767
00:58:07,617 --> 00:58:09,585
- Hickory nuts.
- Oh, thank you.

768
00:58:09,652 --> 00:58:12,712
Put 'em in hot water, boil 'em for 30 seconds
to separate the meat.

769
00:58:12,789 --> 00:58:14,723
Thanks.

770
00:58:14,791 --> 00:58:17,453
Now, you-you be careful, son.

771
00:58:20,129 --> 00:58:22,063

- Thanks, Mrs. Stokes.

Excuse me.

776
00:58:39,182 --> 00:58:43,141
- So you were a missionary?
- Forty-five years.

777

- And is that your father?
- Mm-hmm.

Absent.

782
00:58:56,032 --> 00:58:58,728
Leaves a hole, doesn't it?

783
00:58:58,801 --> 00:59:00,792
A big one.

784
00:59:02,005 --> 00:59:04,667
You know...

785
00:59:04,741 --> 00:59:06,834
years ago...

786
00:59:06,910 --> 00:59:11,870
I wrote down every disappointment
on a piece of paper...

787
00:59:11,948 --> 00:59:14,109
forgave each one...

788
00:59:14,183 --> 00:59:16,777
- and then burned them.
- [Chuckles]

789
00:59:18,154 --> 00:59:22,887
Now I can look at that picture...
and smile.

00:59:22,959 --> 00:59:24,950
Hmm.

791
01:00:11,207 --> 01:00:13,232
This is where she prays.

792
01:00:51,147 --> 01:00:54,810
- Can you tell Jo I'll be back in a few hours?
- Sure thing.

793
01:00:56,653 --> 01:00:59,019
So what do you think?

794
01:01:00,790 --> 01:01:05,750
She's great, but I don't think
it really matters what I think now, does it?

795
01:01:07,797 --> 01:01:09,890
I'll be back soon.

796
01:01:09,966 --> 01:01:11,957
I'm sure you will.

797
01:01:18,775 --> 01:01:20,709
Morning.

798
01:01:20,777 --> 01:01:23,871
Jo, hey! It's Renny.

799
01:01:23,946 --> 01:01:26,346
No, everything's fine.
Uh, listen.

800
01:01:26,416 --> 01:01:30,944
I wonder if you wouldn't mind staying
at Mrs. Stokes's house just a couple more days.

801
01:01:31,020 --> 01:01:33,989
Really? Well, that- that'd be great.

802
01:01:34,057 --> 01:01:36,992
Okay, I'll, uh-
I'll see you soon.

803
01:01:37,060 --> 01:01:38,994
All right, bye.

804
01:01:47,003 --> 01:01:49,494
I'm worried about him.

805
01:01:49,572 --> 01:01:51,540
Mm-hmm.

806
01:01:51,607 --> 01:01:54,235
I've prayed for a lot
of people in that room...

807
01:01:54,310 --> 01:01:58,644
but recently it's Renny
who keeps sending me back.

808
01:01:58,715 --> 01:02:02,242
I don't think you and I are worried
for the same reasons.

809
01:02:02,318 --> 01:02:04,513
You wanna tell me?

810
01:02:04,587 --> 01:02:07,886
- Good morning, Bonny.
- <i>Good morning, Renny.</i>

811
01:02:07,957 --> 01:02:11,620
Will you tell Barnette I got the signatures
and I'll have the memo on Monday.

812
01:02:11,694 --> 01:02:13,628
- Will do.
- Thank you.

813
01:02:13,696 --> 01:02:15,857
- Mm-hmm.
- Is he here?

814
01:02:15,932 --> 01:02:17,923
Right behind you.

815
01:02:19,335 --> 01:02:21,826
- Hey, Renny.
- Thomas.

816
01:02:21,904 --> 01:02:24,236
[Chuckles]
Good to see you.

817
01:02:24,307 --> 01:02:27,640
I'm here on behalf of Gus Eicholtz.

818
01:02:29,078 --> 01:02:32,047
Let's get some air.
How ya doin', darlin'?

819
01:02:32,115 --> 01:02:35,278
<i>Gus says we can trust you</i>
<i>on this matter.</i>

820
01:02:36,786 --> 01:02:40,085
The Larochette family
has maintained a tight grip on the List...

821
01:02:40,156 --> 01:02:43,922
and its funds for far too long.

822
01:02:43,993 --> 01:02:47,053
We now believe that Desmond
and a couple of the others...

823
01:02:47,130 --> 01:02:51,897
are plotting to tip the scales
even further in their favor.

824
01:02:51,968 --> 01:02:54,027
I don't understand, Thomas.

825
01:02:54,103 --> 01:02:57,504
The List has been going strong
since the Civil War.

826
01:02:57,573 --> 01:03:00,736
Well, Taylor Johnston, a daughter.

827
01:03:00,810 --> 01:03:03,643
Bart Maxwell, no son.

828
01:03:05,348 --> 01:03:08,840
The power of attorney we all
sign enables the List...

829
01:03:08,918 --> 01:03:12,684
to reclaim a member's money
if he dies without a male heir.

830
01:03:12,755 --> 01:03:15,417
The power of attorney is invalid
once a person dies.

831
01:03:15,491 --> 01:03:19,052
[Laughs]
That's very true. Very true.

832
01:03:20,196 --> 01:03:23,222
So who's telling
the Swiss bankers, hmm?

833
01:03:23,299 --> 01:03:25,290
Well, who gets the money?

834
01:03:26,302 --> 01:03:29,169
- Larochette.
- You're kidding.

835
01:03:29,238 --> 01:03:32,071
From the beginning, that family
has been in total control.

836
01:03:32,141 --> 01:03:35,474
And nobody but nobody crosses 'em.

837
01:03:37,713 --> 01:03:39,704
Till now.

838
01:03:56,999 --> 01:04:00,730
There's a plan in place,
and you play a big part in it.

839
01:04:00,803 --> 01:04:02,668
Me?

840
01:04:02,738 --> 01:04:05,400
I saw the way you stood up
for Miss Johnston the other night.

841
01:04:05,474 --> 01:04:07,965
You got a lot of guts, kid.

842
01:04:08,044 --> 01:04:10,569
We like that.

843
01:04:10,646 --> 01:04:13,240
As it stands now,
there's eight voting members.

844
01:04:13,316 --> 01:04:17,412
But before we put a rubber stamp
on Desmond's distribution plan...

845
01:04:17,486 --> 01:04:23,118
I want you to call for a vote
to replace him as president.

846
01:04:23,192 --> 01:04:27,060
- On what grounds?
- Well, you're an attorney. Be creative.

847
01:04:28,464 --> 01:04:32,093
If Desmond tries a power play,
we'll come up with somethin'.

848
01:04:34,070 --> 01:04:38,097
All we need to act on this
is a simple majority, and we'll have that.

with Desmond. That's no big surprise.

Well, that would be me.

854
01:04:55,925 --> 01:04:58,985
And my first act as president
will be to make a motion...

855
01:04:59,061 --> 01:05:03,930
for distribution of the significantly
larger sum of money...

856
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:08,232

is that God's children and his enemies
make the same mistake-

875
01:06:30,186 --> 01:06:33,622

the power of prayer.

1190
01:33:01,642 --> 01:33:05,442
that there'll be a special
meeting <i>tomorrow night!</i>

1191
01:33:07,181 --> 01:33:09,115
So how do we handle Gus?

1192
01:33:09,183 --> 01:33:12,152
Something unique would be nice.

1193
01:33:12,219 --> 01:33:15,211
I called the hospital.
She's still hanging on.

1194
01:33:15,289 --> 01:33:17,314
I'm surprised
she's not dead.

1195
01:33:17,391 --> 01:33:19,859
Ah.

1196
01:33:19,927 --> 01:33:23,693
The others submitted
to the power of the List.

1197
01:33:23,764 --> 01:33:26,232
But don't worry.

1198
01:33:26,300 --> 01:33:28,860
I've seen the end
right from the beginning.

1199
01:33:46,487 --> 01:33:49,047
I call that my wall of faith.

1200
01:33:49,123 --> 01:33:51,353
<i>Look at their eyes.</i>

1201
01:33:52,893 --> 01:33:55,589
<i>Before God got hold of them...</i>

1202
01:33:55,663 --> 01:33:57,494
and after.

1203
01:34:01,168 --> 01:34:05,161
All those people
had one thing in common-

1204
01:34:05,239 --> 01:34:08,402
they thought they were 1,000 miles
from the promised land.

1205
01:34:09,577 --> 01:34:14,173
Truth is, they was
just one step away.

1206
01:34:15,616 --> 01:34:18,915
<i>[Mama A]</i>
<i>Amen.</i>

1207
01:34:18,986 --> 01:34:21,216
<i>[Daisy's Voice, overlapping]</i>
<i>"The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want."</i>

1208
01:34:21,288 --> 01:34:23,882
<i>Heal her.</i>
<i>"He maketh me to lie down in green pastures"-</i>

1209
01:34:23,958 --> 01:34:25,550
<i>Heal her.</i>
<i>"And leadeth me beside the still waters."</i>

1210
01:34:25,626 --> 01:34:27,560
<i>Heal her.</i>
<i>"He restoreth my soul.</i>

1211
01:34:27,628 --> 01:34:30,995
<i>He leadeth me in the path of righteousness</i>
<i>for his namesake. " Surrender.</i>

1212
01:34:31,065 --> 01:34:35,229
<i>"Yea, though I walk through the valley</i>
<i>of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil"-</i>

1213
01:34:35,302 --> 01:34:38,362
<i>Surrender. Strength. "For thou art with me.</i>
<i>Thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me.</i>

01:34:38,439 --> 01:34:41,408
<i>"He preparest a table before me</i>

01:34:41,475 --> 01:34:45,241

01:34:45,312 --> 01:34:48,247
<i>"Surely goodness and mercy</i>

1218
01:34:51,519 --> 01:34:54,511
[Crying]

1219
01:35:14,508 --> 01:35:16,806
<i>[Thunderclap]</i>

1220
01:35:32,159 --> 01:35:36,619
Yes! Yes,
I, the Lord thy God...

1221
01:35:36,697 --> 01:35:39,222
<i>am a jealous God...</i>

1222
01:35:39,300 --> 01:35:42,929
<i>visiting the iniquities</i>

1224

<i>unto the thousands of them</i>

1226
01:35:53,247 --> 01:35:56,978
<i>and keep my commandments.</i>

1227
01:35:57,051 --> 01:35:59,485
This is what the Lord said.

1228
01:35:59,553 --> 01:36:01,919
I've got something to say.

1229
01:36:03,190 --> 01:36:07,320
I kept asking myself, "Why?"

1230
01:36:07,394 --> 01:36:10,261
Why did my father
leave me nothin'?

1231
01:36:10,331 --> 01:36:12,663
Why did you trick me?

1232
01:36:12,733 --> 01:36:15,896
And why did all this
have to happen?

1233
01:36:15,970 --> 01:36:18,632
<i>And then I realized...</i>

1234
01:36:20,107 --> 01:36:22,769
you're all blind.

1235
01:36:22,843 --> 01:36:26,472
My father. You, Larochette.

1236
01:36:26,547 --> 01:36:28,481
- [Chuckles]
- <i>Even you, Gus.</i>

1237
01:36:28,549 --> 01:36:30,847
<i>You're all blinded by this.</i>

1238
01:36:30,918 --> 01:36:34,319
<i>You're nothing but a bunch</i>
<i>of selfish, greedy old men.</i>

1239
01:36:34,388 --> 01:36:37,482
<i>And I don't want any part of it.</i>

1240
01:36:39,660 --> 01:36:42,595
Whatever has happened
in the past...

1241
01:36:42,663 --> 01:36:45,029
whatever will happen
from this point forward...

1242
01:36:45,099 --> 01:36:49,593
<i>your power over me,</i>
<i>over my family...</i>

1243
01:36:49,670 --> 01:36:53,401
over the people I love,
ends <i>now!</i>

1244
01:36:54,575 --> 01:36:56,736
[Gasps]

1245
01:37:05,686 --> 01:37:07,745
[Keys Jangle]

1246
01:37:07,822 --> 01:37:12,054
He signed in blood.
I own him.

1247
01:37:22,236 --> 01:37:26,195
<i>Rower? I'll show you power.</i>

1248
01:38:04,912 --> 01:38:06,846
Blessing.

1249
01:38:08,916 --> 01:38:10,907
<i>Blessing.</i>

1250
01:38:13,320 --> 01:38:15,311
Bless-

01:38:16,323 --> 01:38:19,417
[Crying]

1252
01:38:28,469 --> 01:38:30,460
[Sighs]

1253
01:38:37,845 --> 01:38:40,871
- What's this?
- It's Daisy's holographic will.

1254
01:38:40,948 --> 01:38:43,508
- Her what?
- It's a will in her own handwriting.

1255
01:38:43,584 --> 01:38:46,951
She wrote it four days ago.
Perfectly legal.

1256
01:38:47,021 --> 01:38:50,684
<i>Believe me, I should know.</i>

1257
01:38:50,758 --> 01:38:53,158
Renny, she gave you the house.

1258
01:38:55,396 --> 01:38:57,887
She gave me a lot more than that.

1259
01:38:57,965 --> 01:38:59,956
They all did.

1260
01:39:33,767 --> 01:39:35,758
So why weren't you?

1261
01:39:36,971 --> 01:39:38,905
Why wasn't I what?

1262
01:39:38,973 --> 01:39:40,964
Crying.

1263
01:39:42,776 --> 01:39:45,176
Well, why were you?

1264
01:39:48,115 --> 01:39:50,743
My entire life
I've been looking for my father.

1265
01:39:50,818 --> 01:39:55,448
So, when we buried him,
that was it. You know?

1266
01:39:55,522 --> 01:39:57,456
I'd never know him.

1267
01:39:58,892 --> 01:40:03,158
But... here, with Mrs. Stokes...

1268
01:40:03,230 --> 01:40:07,792
I think I found what it is
I'm looking for.

1269
01:40:07,868 --> 01:40:09,859
Thank you.

1270
01:40:19,480 --> 01:40:21,414
Isn't it gorgeous?

1271
01:40:26,220 --> 01:40:28,085
Yes, it is.

1272
01:40:31,525 --> 01:40:36,087
This place kind of reminds me of Lake Moultrie
in Charleston where I grew up.

1273
01:40:36,163 --> 01:40:40,099
I was... five years old, I guess...

1274
01:40:40,167 --> 01:40:43,330
the first time my parents
brought me there.

1275
01:40:49,643 --> 01:40:53,101
It's where my father
taught me to swim.

1276
01:40:53,180 --> 01:40:55,114
I was horrible at it too.

1277
01:40:55,182 --> 01:41:00,051
<i>I mean, I'd struggle</i>
<i>in the water, flailing my arms...</i>

1278
01:41:00,120 --> 01:41:03,146
trying anything
I could just to stay afloat.

1279
01:41:04,525 --> 01:41:08,017
My mother,
she'd stand on the bank...

1280
01:41:09,229 --> 01:41:11,823
lookin' down.

1281
01:41:11,899 --> 01:41:14,834
She'd just pray.

1282
01:41:28,082 --> 01:41:30,880
Jo.

1283
01:41:58,445 --> 01:42:01,881
<i>[Daisy's Voice]</i>
<i>There is something I've learned, Jo.</i>

1284
01:42:01,949 --> 01:42:04,179
<i>God's children and his enemies...</i>

1285
01:42:04,251 --> 01:42:07,778
<i>both make the same mistake-</i>

1286
01:42:07,855 --> 01:42:11,518
<i>they both underestimate</i>
<i>the power of prayer.</i>

1287
01:42:13,160 --> 01:42:15,007
<i>Let's keep praying.</i>
