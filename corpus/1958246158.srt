00:24:51,933 --> 00:24:54,400
- ALEX, THAT WOULD BE DOPE.

353
00:24:54,433 --> 00:24:58,233
YOU PROVIDE THE SPACE,
I'LL PROVIDE THE JAMS.

354
00:24:59,433 --> 00:25:01,067
- EW.

355
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:07,767
- I'VE GOTTA GO.
MY DAD'S LEAVING LATE.

356
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:10,933
- AH, I'LL GIVE YOU A RIDE.

357
00:25:10,967 --> 00:25:13,167
- THANK YOU.

358
00:25:14,833 --> 00:25:16,367
- NICE TO MEET YOU SKYE.

359
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,600
- YEAH.

360
00:25:19,933 --> 00:25:22,133
- SHE'S NOT GOING TO DO IT.
- WE'LL SEE.

361
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:28,700
BYE.

362
00:25:34,533 --> 00:25:37,333
- SHE KNEW YOU WERE LEAVING.
SHE SAID SHE WOULD BE HERE.

363
00:25:37,367 --> 00:25:41,600
- THAT'S FINE.
I GOTTA GET GOING.

364
00:25:41,633 --> 00:25:44,367
FIGURE I'D STOP BY THE CLUB
BEFORE THE FLIGHT.

365
00:25:49,833 --> 00:25:52,933
YOU GOING TO BE OKAY HERE?

366
00:25:54,567 --> 00:25:56,833
- I WILL BE OKAY.
- OKAY.

367
00:25:56,867 --> 00:25:58,167
- OKAY.

368
00:26:12,933 --> 00:26:15,300
[vehicle approaches]

369
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:20,867
- SORRY WE'RE LATE.

370
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:23,067
- YOU MISSED YOUR DAD.

371
00:26:23,067 --> 00:26:24,367
YOU KNOW HE'S REALLY
STRESSED RIGHT NOW,

372
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,600
AND I DON'T THINK
IT'S TOO MUCH TO ASK

373
00:26:25,633 --> 00:26:28,067
FOR YOU TO BE HERE
WHEN HE LEAVES ON A TRIP.

374
00:26:28,067 --> 00:26:30,100
- I SAID I'M SORRY.

375
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:34,367
SHE HATES IT WHEN HE TRAVELS,
SO SHE TAKES IT OUT ON ME.

376
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:37,700
PARENTS CAN BE SO MESSED UP.

377
00:26:37,733 --> 00:26:39,200
GUESS YOU KNOW THAT.

378
00:26:39,233 --> 00:26:42,533
YOUR DAD MUST BE A NIGHTMARE
TO END UP HERE.

379
00:26:42,567 --> 00:26:45,367
- MY DAD'S DEAD.

380
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:48,433
- I'M SORRY, I DIDN'T KNOW.

381
00:26:48,467 --> 00:26:53,233
- * YOU BRING SUNSHINE

382
00:26:53,267 --> 00:26:56,333
[volume rises]
* WHEN YOU'RE WALKIN' THROUGH

383
00:26:56,367 --> 00:26:59,500
*

384
00:26:59,533 --> 00:27:04,333
* AND EVERYTHING
FEELS RIGHT *

385
00:27:04,367 --> 00:27:06,767
* WHEN YOU'RE JUST BEIN' YOU

386
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:08,967
[cell phone rings]

387
00:27:09,067 --> 00:27:11,433
- HELLO.

388
00:27:11,467 --> 00:27:13,433
YEAH, I'M ON MY WAY.

389
00:27:13,467 --> 00:27:15,900
YEAH, I'LL BE RIGHT THERE.

390
00:27:15,933 --> 00:27:17,767
I'LL TAKE CARE OF IT.

391
00:27:21,067 --> 00:27:24,500
- * WE'VE GOT ALL WE NEED

392
00:27:24,533 --> 00:27:25,667
* RIGHT HERE

393
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:28,133
- UH-HUH.

394
00:27:28,167 --> 00:27:30,933
YEAH.

395
00:27:30,967 --> 00:27:33,667
YEAH, PETE, THEY'RE RUNNING
A LITTLE BEHIND.

396
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:36,633
YEAH, WE'RE WAITING ON
FINAL APPROVAL ANYWAYS.

397
00:27:36,667 --> 00:27:38,267
WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL?

398
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:40,600
OKAY, NO, I'LL DEAL WITH IT
WHEN I GET BACK.

399
00:27:40,633 --> 00:27:42,333
GREAT.
THANKS.

400
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:54,667
- PARDON ME.

401
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:57,233
MY DARN TRUCK WON'T START.

402
00:27:57,267 --> 00:28:00,700
I WAS WONDERING
IF YOU HAD JUMPER CABLES.

403
00:28:00,733 --> 00:28:02,467
- UH...

404
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:04,233
YEAH, YEAH SURE.

405
00:28:04,267 --> 00:28:07,133
COME ON.

406
00:28:07,167 --> 00:28:08,700
BUMMER, HUH?

407
00:28:13,767 --> 00:28:16,067
GET THIS OUTTA HERE.

408
00:28:16,067 --> 00:28:19,067
- YOU KNOW, YOU...
YOU LOOK REALLY FAMILIAR.

409
00:28:19,067 --> 00:28:20,833
- EH, IT'S A SMALL TOWN.

410
00:28:20,867 --> 00:28:22,633
YOU LIVE AROUND HERE?

411
00:28:22,667 --> 00:28:26,167
- NAH, MY DAUGHTER'S HERE
STAYING WITH HER MOM,

412
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:27,833
BUT I CAME
TO BRING HER HOME.

413
00:28:27,867 --> 00:28:29,733
- OH, THAT'S NICE.

414
00:28:29,767 --> 00:28:34,067
- YOU GOT KIDS?
- YEAH, A DAUGHTER, ACTUALLY.

415
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:36,067
- I BET YOU GIVE HER
EVERYTHING SHE WANTS.

416
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:37,833
- WHAT'S THE POINT
OF HAVING A DAUGHTER

417
00:28:37,867 --> 00:28:40,367
IF YOU CAN'T SPOIL HER,
RIGHT?

418
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:42,233
- I'M NOT GOING TO
LET YOU TAKE HER.

419
00:28:42,267 --> 00:28:44,267
- WHAT?

420
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:46,600
- I WON'T LET YOU
TAKE SKYE FROM ME.

421
00:28:48,067 --> 00:28:50,200
- NO--
AAH! AAH! AAH!

422
00:29:20,067 --> 00:29:22,200
- MY MOM'S STILL MAD
ABOUT YESTERDAY.

423
00:29:22,233 --> 00:29:24,467
I SWEAR, ONE MINUTE
SHE'S TREATING ME

424
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:25,767
LIKE I'M ABOUT TO
FALL APART,

425
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:28,067
THE NEXT, LIKE I'M THE WORST KID
IN THE WORLD.

426
00:29:28,067 --> 00:29:30,500
SHE WONDERS WHY I'M IN THERAPY.
[chuckles]

427
00:29:32,567 --> 00:29:34,100
IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL,
IT'S JUST--

428
00:29:34,133 --> 00:29:36,467
- YOU DON'T HAVE TO TELL ME
ABOUT IT IF YOU DON'T WANT TO.

429
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:39,067
- NO, I MEAN,
WHEN I WAS IN JUNIOR HIGH...

430
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:41,733
I DON'T KNOW
HOW TO EXPLAIN IT.

431
00:29:41,767 --> 00:29:44,967
THINGS JUST KINDA
FELT LIKE TOO MUCH.

432
00:29:45,067 --> 00:29:47,100
SORTA TRIED TO HURT MYSELF.

433
00:29:49,067 --> 00:29:51,633
I KNOW IT WAS STUPID.
I'M FINE NOW.

434
00:29:55,633 --> 00:29:57,933
WAS THAT TMI?
DID I TOTALLY FREAK YOU OUT?

435
00:30:00,733 --> 00:30:01,767
- NO.

436
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:06,000
TRUST ME, IT TAKES A LOT
TO FREAK ME OUT.

437
00:30:09,933 --> 00:30:13,367
- I ALWAYS WONDERED WHAT IT
WOULD BE LIKE TO HAVE A SISTER.

438
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:16,200
IT'S KINDA COOL.

439
00:30:16,233 --> 00:30:18,300
FEEL LIKE
I CAN TELL YOU STUFF.

440
00:30:18,333 --> 00:30:21,333
- WELL, YOU CAN.

441
00:30:23,467 --> 00:30:26,200
AND ARE WE LIKE HAVING
A LITTLE LIFETIME MOMENT HERE?

442
00:30:26,233 --> 00:30:29,067
[both giggling]

443
00:30:33,833 --> 00:30:36,467
- I NEED TO TALK TO YOU.

444
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:38,733
- I'M GOING TO GO INSIDE.
- YOU DON'T HAVE TO.

445
00:30:38,767 --> 00:30:40,633
- NAH, BUT I WANT TO.

446
00:30:44,733 --> 00:30:46,367
- LATER, SKYE.

447
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:49,300
SHE'S SO WEIRD.

448
00:30:49,333 --> 00:30:52,400
FYI, EVERYBODY IS TALKING
ABOUT YOUR PARTY.

449
00:30:52,433 --> 00:30:54,767
JAMS WILL NOT SHUT UP
ABOUT YOU.

450
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:56,900
- REALLY?

451
00:30:56,933 --> 00:30:58,733
- I'M TELLING YOU ALEX,

452
00:30:58,767 --> 00:31:01,167
THROWING THIS PARTY
IS GOING TO BE HUGE FOR YOU.

453
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:03,367
YOU DO THIS AND ON MONDAY,

454
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:05,700
YOU'RE GOING TO BE A COMPLETELY
DIFFERENT PERSON.

455
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:15,633
- OKAY.
- YES!

456
00:31:15,667 --> 00:31:18,067
YOU WON'T REGRET IT,
PROMISE.

457
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:44,067
- HEY, SKYE.

458
00:32:44,067 --> 00:32:46,867
I DIDN'T MEAN TO SCARE YOU.
I JUST CAME TO GRAB A DRINK.

459
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:54,700
LISTEN,
I KNOW YOU'RE NEW IN TOWN,

460
00:32:54,733 --> 00:32:56,700
SO I JUST WANTED
TO LET YOU KNOW

461
00:32:56,733 --> 00:33:00,400
YOU'RE TOTALLY INVITED TO ALEX'S
PARTY TOMORROW NIGHT.

462
00:33:00,433 --> 00:33:03,300
- I DIDN'T REALIZE
SHE WAS HAVING THE PARTY.

463
00:33:03,333 --> 00:33:05,700
- YEP, SHE JUST DECIDED.

464
00:33:05,733 --> 00:33:07,767
IT'S GOING TO BE SUPER FUN.

465
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:10,867
DON'T RUIN IT.

466
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:16,067
- WHATEVER.

467
00:33:17,767 --> 00:33:20,700
- CAN'T WAIT TO GET TO
KNOW YOU BETTER.

468
00:33:34,167 --> 00:33:35,733
WHOA.

469
00:33:47,433 --> 00:33:48,500
[knock on door]

470
00:33:48,533 --> 00:33:50,267
- UH, COME ON!

471
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:51,800
MOM, NOT A GOOD TIME!

472
00:33:53,133 --> 00:33:55,600
BRIGG--
- I NEED TO TALK TO YOU.

473
00:33:55,633 --> 00:33:57,633
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
- NO, I NEED TO TALK TO YOU.

474
00:33:57,667 --> 00:33:58,800
- NO, YOU DON'T.

475
00:33:58,833 --> 00:34:00,867
CAN'T YOU SEE THAT
I HAVE A GIRL ON MY BED?

476
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:03,600
- DEREK.
- I JUST GOT AN EMAIL FROM SKYE.

477
00:34:03,633 --> 00:34:05,333
- I'VE SENT LIKE A MILLION
TEXT MESSAGES.

478
00:34:05,367 --> 00:34:07,067
I'VE GOTTEN JACK.

479
00:34:07,067 --> 00:34:08,767
- [singsong] DEREK.

480
00:34:10,233 --> 00:34:12,933
- "I'M OKAY.
PLEASE DON'T TRY TO FIND ME."

481
00:34:12,967 --> 00:34:14,600
WHAT DO YOU THINK THAT MEANS?

482
00:34:14,633 --> 00:34:16,300
- IT MEANS SHE DOESN'T
WANT YOU TO FIND HER.

483
00:34:16,333 --> 00:34:18,133
- OKAY, BUT SHE SAID
PLEASE DON'T TRY TO FIND ME.

484
00:34:18,167 --> 00:34:19,833
SO MAYBE SHE DOES
WANT US TO FIND HER,

485
00:34:19,867 --> 00:34:21,867
BUT SHE'S JUST AFRAID
TO SAY IT.

486
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:24,200
- OR MAYBE SHE DOESN'T WANT YOU
TO FIND HER, YOU KNOW,

487
00:34:24,233 --> 00:34:25,700
BECAUSE SHE'S A FUGITIVE.

488
00:34:25,733 --> 00:34:28,300
WHY ARE YOU TWO SO OBSESSED
WITH PSYCHO ROTTER ANYWAY?

489
00:34:28,333 --> 00:34:31,067
- DON'T CALL HER THAT.
- SHE'S OUR FRIEND, COURTNEY.

490
00:34:31,067 --> 00:34:32,567
- REALLY?
LAST TIME I CHECKED,

491
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:34,167
THAT NUT JOB DITCHED YOU
AT THE ROLLERDOME

492
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:36,800
AND LEFT YOU FOR DEAD, BRIGG.
- YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW HER.

493
00:34:36,833 --> 00:34:38,100
- I KNEW CHLOE.
I KNEW MADISON.

494
00:34:38,133 --> 00:34:39,467
REMEMBER HER?
YOUR EX-GIRLFRIEND.

495
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:40,733
SHE'S DEAD BECAUSE OF SKYE.

496
00:34:40,767 --> 00:34:43,233
- YOU CAN'T BLAME SKYE
FOR WHAT HER DAD DID.

497
00:34:43,267 --> 00:34:44,733
- OKAY, GUYS, SHUT UP.
I THINK I FOUND HER.

498
00:34:44,767 --> 00:34:47,133
OKAY, HER EMAIL WAS SENT
FROM AN IP ADDRESS

499
00:34:47,167 --> 00:34:49,333
REGISTERED IN MILL BASIN.

500
00:34:49,367 --> 00:34:51,367
- WHERE THE HELL'S THAT?

501
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:52,833
- SOLID DAY'S DRIVE FROM HERE.

502
00:34:52,867 --> 00:34:54,833
WE SHOULD LEAVE FIRST THING
IN THE MORNING.

503
00:34:54,867 --> 00:34:56,267
- WHAT?
WHY?

504
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:57,933
- MEET ME AT MY HOUSE AT 7:00.
- 'KAY.

505
00:35:01,367 --> 00:35:03,667
SO, WHERE WERE WE?

506
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:08,833
YEAH, I KINDA FIGURED.

507
00:35:21,833 --> 00:35:23,700
- OPEN IT.

508
00:35:23,733 --> 00:35:26,200
GO ON.

509
00:35:26,233 --> 00:35:28,600
I SAW IT WHILE I WAS OUT.

510
00:35:28,633 --> 00:35:30,400
I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT LIKE IT.

511
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:39,433
- I LOVE IT.

512
00:35:39,467 --> 00:35:40,800
BUT--

513
00:35:40,833 --> 00:35:43,067
- I KNOW I HAVEN'T BEEN
A PART OF YOUR LIFE SKYE,

514
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:46,433
BUT I DO REMEMBER
THE DAY YOU WERE BORN.

515
00:35:46,467 --> 00:35:48,600
YOU'RE TURNING 16 TOMORROW.

516
00:35:48,633 --> 00:35:50,933
THAT'S A BIG DEAL.

517
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:54,367
WHAT'S WRONG?

518
00:35:57,467 --> 00:35:58,933
- AFTER WHAT HAPPENED,

519
00:35:58,967 --> 00:36:03,700
I WAS KIND OF HOPING TO AVOID
MY BIRTHDAY THIS YEAR.

520
00:36:04,833 --> 00:36:07,133
- THAT WAS NOT YOUR FAULT.

521
00:36:10,133 --> 00:36:14,733
- WELL,
SOMETIMES I...THINK IT WAS.

522
00:36:17,067 --> 00:36:20,633
- YOU HAVE TO PUT THAT

01:16:24,267 --> 01:16:27,067
- ALL HE CARED ABOUT WAS YOU.

1056
01:16:27,067 --> 01:16:32,067
AS LONG AS HE HAD YOU,
HE WOULD STAY AWAY FROM ME.

1057
01:16:32,067 --> 01:16:33,367
BUT YOU BROUGHT HIM HERE.

1058
01:16:33,400 --> 01:16:37,633
- NO.

1059
01:16:37,667 --> 01:16:39,833
- I NEVER SHOULD HAVE
LET YOU STAY.

1060
01:16:39,867 --> 01:16:41,633
THIS IS ALL YOUR FAULT!

1061
01:16:41,667 --> 01:16:42,867
- SHUT YOUR MOUTH!

1062
01:16:42,900 --> 01:16:44,067
- I WISH THAT YOU WOULD HAVE
NEVER FOUND US,

1063
01:16:44,100 --> 01:16:45,833
AND I WISH THAT YOU
WERE NEVER BEEN BORN!

1064
01:16:45,867 --> 01:16:49,333
- SHUT YOUR MOUTH!

1065
01:16:49,367 --> 01:16:53,633
- NO!

1066
01:16:53,667 --> 01:16:54,800
NO!

1067
01:16:54,833 --> 01:16:58,500
NO!

1068
01:17:03,767 --> 01:17:06,767
- COME ON, COME ON!

1069
01:17:06,800 --> 01:17:07,800
COME ON.
COME ON!

1070
01:17:07,833 --> 01:17:10,300
COME ON!

1071
01:17:19,633 --> 01:17:20,767
- THEY'RE DEAD!

1072
01:17:20,800 --> 01:17:21,767
- SHH!

1073
01:17:21,800 --> 01:17:23,433
YOU NEED TO BE QUIET.

1074
01:17:23,467 --> 01:17:27,367
SHH, SHH, YOU NEED--
YOU NEED TO BE QUIET.

1075
01:17:37,500 --> 01:17:40,067
I WON'T LET YOU HURT HER.

1076
01:17:40,067 --> 01:17:41,300
I WON'T LET YOU.

1077
01:17:41,333 --> 01:17:45,067
- THESE PEOPLE,
THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT YOU.

1078
01:17:45,100 --> 01:17:46,733
THEY'RE ROTTEN.

1079
01:17:46,767 --> 01:17:51,300
EVEN YOUR MOTHER.

1080
01:17:54,900 --> 01:17:59,433
- YOU DID WHAT YOU HAD TO.

1081
01:17:59,467 --> 01:18:01,400
I SEE THAT NOW.

1082
01:18:01,433 --> 01:18:04,467
I UNDERSTAND.

1083
01:18:04,500 --> 01:18:09,100
BUT ALEX IS ALL WE HAVE LEFT.

1084
01:18:10,600 --> 01:18:14,233
SHE'S ONE OF US, DAD.

1085
01:18:14,267 --> 01:18:18,267
SHE'S FAMILY.

1086
01:18:18,300 --> 01:18:21,433
WE CAN--WE CAN START OVER.

1087
01:18:21,467 --> 01:18:24,933
JUST US THREE.

1088
01:18:24,967 --> 01:18:28,767
WE CAN FIX EVERYTHING THAT MOM
RUINED WHEN SHE LEFT.

1089
01:18:28,800 --> 01:18:30,967
- I JUST WANT
WHAT'S BEST FOR YOU.

1090
01:18:31,067 --> 01:18:32,600
YOU'RE MY LITTLE GIRL.

1091
01:18:32,633 --> 01:18:35,200
- I KNOW.

1092
01:18:39,067 --> 01:18:42,967
- I LOVE YOU SO MUCH, SWEETIE.

1093
01:18:43,067 --> 01:18:45,933
SO MUCH.

1094
01:18:45,967 --> 01:18:50,900
- I KNOW.

1095
01:18:50,933 --> 01:18:54,100
WE CAN BE
WHAT WE SHOULD'VE BEEN

1096
01:18:54,133 --> 01:18:57,467
FROM THE BEGINNING.

1097
01:19:01,567 --> 01:19:04,467
- A FAMILY.

1098
01:19:17,800 --> 01:19:19,600
- DAD, NO!

1099
01:19:19,633 --> 01:19:21,633
- [screams]

1100
01:19:21,667 --> 01:19:24,467
- AHH!

1101
01:19:28,867 --> 01:19:29,967
- BRIGG!

1102
01:19:30,067 --> 01:19:31,867
STOP IT!

1103
01:19:31,900 --> 01:19:33,833
BRIGG!

1104
01:19:36,567 --> 01:19:37,600
BRIGG!

1105
01:19:37,633 --> 01:19:38,700
STOP IT!

1106
01:19:38,733 --> 01:19:42,100
PLEASE!

1107
01:19:42,133 --> 01:19:45,133
PLEASE.

1108
01:19:51,633 --> 01:19:54,867
IT'S OKAY.
IT'S OKAY.

1109
01:19:54,900 --> 01:19:57,467
IT'S OKAY.

1110
01:20:21,867 --> 01:20:25,533
- IT WAS ALL FOR YOU.

1111
01:20:37,433 --> 01:20:41,067
- SO IS THIS.

1112
01:20:47,200 --> 01:20:49,667
- [gagging]

1113
01:21:20,400 --> 01:21:24,067
- ARE YOU OKAY?

1114
01:21:24,067 --> 01:21:29,367
- I WILL BE.

1115
01:22:18,067 --> 01:22:20,300
- ARE YOU STILL HAVING
NIGHTMARES?

1116
01:22:20,333 --> 01:22:21,400
- NO.

1117
01:22:21,433 --> 01:22:23,200
NO NIGHTMARES.

1118
01:22:23,233 --> 01:22:26,067
- ALEX.

1119
01:22:26,067 --> 01:22:28,267
- MAYBE A FEW.

1120
01:22:28,300 --> 01:22:30,933
BUT NOT LIKE IT WAS.

1121
01:22:30,967 --> 01:22:33,633
- AND THINGS WITH YOUR
GRANDPARENTS?

1122
01:22:33,667 --> 01:22:36,933
- THEY'RE FINE.

1123
01:22:36,967 --> 01:22:40,767
- I WANNA TALK TO YOU
ABOUT YOUR SISTER.

1124
01:22:40,800 --> 01:22:46,267
I SEE SHE'S LIVING WITH HER
BOYFRIEND AND HIS FAMILY?

1125
01:22:46,300 --> 01:22:51,300
DO YOU STILL BLAME HER
FOR WHAT HAPPENED?

1126
01:22:51,333 --> 01:22:54,833
- NO.

1127
01:22:54,867 --> 01:23:00,833
- * GET BACK TOGETHER

1128
01:23:00,867 --> 01:23:02,833
* PIECE BY PIECE

1129
01:23:02,867 --> 01:23:04,567
- GOOD.

1130
01:23:04,600 --> 01:23:07,600
THIS IS PROGRESS.

1131
01:23:07,633 --> 01:23:12,100
- I KNOW IT WASN'T HER FAULT.

1132
01:23:12,133 --> 01:23:15,200
CHARLIE'S THE REASON
THEY'RE DEAD.

1133
01:23:15,233 --> 01:23:17,433
SHE'S A VICTIM.

1134
01:23:17,467 --> 01:23:19,233
JUST LIKE ME.

1135
01:23:19,267 --> 01:23:21,500
- I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT
FOR YOU TO SEE HER.

1136
01:23:21,533 --> 01:23:23,467
FACE TO FACE.

1137
01:23:23,500 --> 01:23:27,067
- * I'LL MAKE YOU REMEMBER,
BABY *

1138
01:23:27,100 --> 01:23:30,067
- YOU KNOW,
I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT.

1139
01:23:30,100 --> 01:23:31,500
I SHOULD SEE SKYE.

1140
01:23:31,533 --> 01:23:33,433
- * AND IF YOU COME NOW

1141
01:23:33,467 --> 01:23:34,700
- IT'D BE A SHAME TO LOSE TOUCH.

1142
01:23:34,733 --> 01:23:38,833
- * WE'LL NEVER KNOW

1143
01:23:41,600 --> 01:23:45,900
- AFTER ALL, WE'RE FAMILY.

1144
01:23:45,933 --> 01:23:51,100
*

1145
01:23:51,133 --> 01:23:53,100
- * AND IF YOU COME NOW

1146
01:23:53,133 --> 01:23:57,100
 * THEN WE'LL NEVER KNOW

1147
01:23:57,133 --> 01:23:58,867
* HOW IT ENDS
