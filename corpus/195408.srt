1
00:02:31,879 --> 00:02:35,838
In summer 1944 Red Army troops reached
western frontier of the Soviet Union.

2
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:40,078
Looks like they've gone through.
I am sure they have made it.

3
00:02:40,159 --> 00:02:42,514
Marchenko never fails

4
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,677
Yes. Comrade lieutenant,
"first" will be talking to you.

5
00:02:46,479 --> 00:02:47,674
Listening, comrade "first".

6
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,909
How is it, Travkin?
Has Marchenko gone through?

7
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:51,789
Not yet.

8
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,149
But is everything quiet?

9
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,157
Everything is quiet for now.

10
00:02:55,439 --> 00:02:57,954
Are you ready to cover the group's retreat,
if you see red flare?

11
00:02:58,959 --> 00:02:59,630
Yes.

12
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:01,988
So, the Germans are quiet, aren't they?

13
00:04:23,079 --> 00:04:24,593
What's your name?

14
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,156
Private signaller, Simakova.

15
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:29,307
How do your mom and dad call you?

16
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,310
Katia.

17
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:33,274
Have you been long on the front line?

18
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:34,196
It's my first day.

19
00:04:36,079 --> 00:04:36,910
You are so beautiful, Katia.

20
00:04:41,319 --> 00:04:42,309
Your hand.

21
00:04:45,319 --> 00:04:48,072
My name is Andrei.

22
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,798
Captain Barashkin.
From the headquarters.

23
00:04:51,879 --> 00:04:53,233
See you later, Katia.

24
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:23,550
Lida!

25
00:05:28,279 --> 00:05:29,110
Lida!

26
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:36,992
I am here.
I am here, mom.

27
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,238
Look, I found a doll.

28
00:05:39,959 --> 00:05:42,189
Mommy, mommy.

29
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:46,990
Calm down; I am here with you.

30
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,668
Step aside.

31
00:05:51,839 --> 00:05:52,954
There's no tourniquet.

32
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:53,995
Bring the belt.

33
00:05:54,439 --> 00:05:57,716
I went out; and it just blasted.

34
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:02,072
You are lucky; you've survived.

35
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:08,918
Get the horses back, understand?

36
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:09,915
Yes.

37
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:13,231
Inform the troops about the order
of the commander in chief

38
00:07:13,559 --> 00:07:16,232
that the first unit to reach the frontier

39
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:19,273
will be awarded the
"Hero of the Soviet Union" order.

40
00:07:19,679 --> 00:07:21,909
You understand; we are planning
a major military mission

41
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,951
that will be supervised
by the General headquarters.

42
00:07:24,279 --> 00:07:26,509
Still, you have got no information
about intents of the enemy.

43
00:07:26,799 --> 00:07:27,788
We have some.

44
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,234
We do all we can.

45
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:30,989
Two weeks have passed.

46
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:32,990
Two weeks,
and you still don't know much.

47
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,913
Head of corps staff demands
that we send scouts to the enemy rear.

48
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:37,759
We have already sent.

49
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:38,397
We have sent two groups.

50
00:07:38,559 --> 00:07:39,708
Comrade colonel, let me report.

51
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:40,917
Go ahead.

52
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,157
They are still quiet, comrade colonel.

53
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:48,068
Maybe, they have made it through.

54
00:07:49,799 --> 00:07:52,917
I got the assignment to help you organize
a new raid of scouts to the enemy rear.

55
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,918
I've got none to send.

56
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:55,990
I've got no more scouts.

57
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,188
Only two are left out of eighteen.

58
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:01,953
Perhaps, for you, 16 men are not much,
but for me every single counts.

59
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:04,796
I have some people in the reserve.

60
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:06,268
You will get some additional personnel.

61
00:08:07,159 --> 00:08:08,990
Thank you for the assistance,
comrade captain.

62
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:11,836
Good day, girls.

63
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:13,951
Is there any news?

64
00:08:19,799 --> 00:08:22,360
That is nothing. As long as Mamachkin
is alive, Hitler trembles, got it?

65
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,035
Is she new?

66
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:31,350
Have you come from another unit,
or right from above?

67
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:33,791
Let me introduce myself?

68
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:35,711
Sergeant Mamachkin.
Kostia.

69
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:36,955
Katia.

70
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,672
Nice to meet you.

71
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,028
You know what, Katia?

72
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:41,912
You are incredibly lucky
to have met me

73
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:42,955
Do you know who you
should be friends with in the army?

74
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:43,909
With you?

75
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:45,115
With the scouts.

76
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:47,037
Because scouts are
the best men on the frontline.

77
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,871
And, guess who is the bravest
and the most reckless.

78
00:08:49,559 --> 00:08:50,879
Again, scouts.

79
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:53,673
And is the guy, you rode with,
also a scout?

80
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,193
Lieutenant Travkin? Yes.

81
00:08:55,759 --> 00:08:57,955
You won't find anyone like him
in the whole Red Army.

82
00:08:59,799 --> 00:09:01,596
He always runs around near the front line,

83
00:09:01,679 --> 00:09:03,033
studying the map, making sketches...

84
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,349
That is just the way he is.

85
00:09:04,559 --> 00:09:06,072
Help yourself;
everything is fresh and tasty.

86
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,075
Good afternoon, comrade lieutenant.

87
00:09:09,159 --> 00:09:13,072
We have a beautiful lady visiting us.

88
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,753
From the communication unit.

89
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,514
Hello.

90
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:19,995
Where is the food from?

91
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:22,115
It is a gift from thankful civilians
to heroic Red Army

92
00:09:22,279 --> 00:09:25,077
for freeing them
from the invaders ahead of schedule.

93
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:28,076
Please, join us. Take a sit.

94
00:09:29,039 --> 00:09:30,109
One day at the observation point,

95
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,754
and let the thankful civilians
have some rest from you.

96
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:33,636
Yes.

97
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,149
Why do you allow
strangers to the position?

98
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,436
You should not have said it.
She is a good girl.

99
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,190
What did they tell you
at the headquarters?

100
00:09:49,039 --> 00:09:50,917
We have to move out to scout.

101
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:52,432
How is that?

102
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:53,600
What do you mean?

103
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,827
We've got no men for that.

104
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,109
You mean, just the two of us will go?

105
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,269
We will have people.

106
00:10:07,879 --> 00:10:09,278
Thank you, brother.

107
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:10,355
Here they are.

108
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,150
How can they be scouts?

109
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,798
They are only good
to drive mares in supply transport.

110
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:21,596
The group of three men has arrived
to reinforce the scout platoon.

111
00:10:22,919 --> 00:10:25,195
The head of the group
is sergeant Brazhnikov.

112
00:10:25,559 --> 00:10:27,278
I am commander of the scout platoon,
lieutenant Travkin.

113
00:10:30,159 --> 00:10:30,797
A scout?

114
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,990
Yes, from the first Ukranian.

115
00:10:37,039 --> 00:10:39,837
Good afternoon. I am private Kentakov
from infantry.

116
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:40,990
And why to a scout platoon?

117
00:10:42,159 --> 00:10:43,354
I can shoot.

118
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:45,635
So, shoot.

119
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:00,990
I am a hunter.

120
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:04,875
Are you also a hunter?

121
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:05,750
No, I am not.

122
00:11:05,919 --> 00:11:08,991
I am private Bikov.
I know the vicinity very well.

123
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:11,993
My home is about 30 km from here.

124
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,152
Being in a scout platoon
is not visiting your mommy.

125
00:11:17,039 --> 00:11:17,995
Private Bikov!

126
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:19,990
I am sorry.

127
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,110
Our sort of man.

128
00:11:26,919 --> 00:11:28,797
Comrade Lieutenant,
I am private Vorobiev.

129
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:29,995
Let me report.

130
00:11:30,679 --> 00:11:31,317
Go ahead.

131
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,236
Do you need rated sportsmen?

132
00:11:33,639 --> 00:11:34,311
What sport?

133
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,154
Chess.

134
00:11:39,159 --> 00:11:40,070
At ease, private Vorobiev.

135
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:40,956
I also speak German.

136
00:11:42,919 --> 00:11:45,912
(Speaks German)

137
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:05,953
"Zaria", "Zaria", come in.
I am "The Earth".

138
00:12:06,279 --> 00:12:07,190
Reply to "The Earth".

139
00:12:38,159 --> 00:12:39,388
Have you really been to Moscow?

140
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:45,912
Yes, twice.

141
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,195
Is it very beautiful?

142
00:12:48,279 --> 00:12:48,836
Yes, very.

143
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:54,076
What did you want to be
before the war?

144
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:03,113
It would have been so great
to be in Moscow right now?

145
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,394
My sister is in Moscow.

146
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,154
She is in conservatorium.

147
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,115
Wow!

148
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,038
Does she sing?

149
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:11,955
She plays the violin.

150
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:15,989
What did you want to be?

151
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:17,269
I don't know yet.

152
00:13:18,159 --> 00:13:19,115
I've just left my secondary school.

153
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:20,948
Did you volunteer to the front?

154
00:13:21,159 --> 00:13:23,514
Yes, of course, I did.

155
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:36,791
So, the code for enemy tanks is 49,
21 is for infantry.

156
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,037
For instance,
you need to say tanks are in this area...

157
00:13:41,039 --> 00:13:43,076
You say: "49 in area 4".

158
00:13:43,759 --> 00:13:44,350
If it is infantry, then...

159
00:13:45,039 --> 00:13:45,995
"21 area 4".

160
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,235
Well done.

161
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:51,988
The code for the scout group is "Star"
and we will, as always, be "The Earth".

162
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:54,030
Don't you want to take
a radio operator with you.

163
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:57,196
Today I got a report
from private Simakova.

164
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:00,190
She wants to go with you.

165
00:14:02,159 --> 00:14:03,149
What is it for?

166
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:05,115
We don't need anyone.

167
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:07,312
We are not going
for a nice walk in park.

168
00:14:10,159 --> 00:14:11,354
OK, try yourself.

169
00:14:13,159 --> 00:14:16,788
"The Earth", come in. I am "Star".
You hear me? Over.

170
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,195
"Star", I am "The Earth".
I can hear you well.

171
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:22,594
"The Earth", I am "Star". Reply.

172
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,115
"The Earth", can you hear me?

173
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,274
Anick Anick

174
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:51,155
Here I am, comrade Lieutenant.

175
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:52,469
How is you leg?

176
00:14:53,039 --> 00:14:53,789
Good enough to dance.

177
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:56,668
Are you here to stay,
or going somewhere else?

178
00:14:57,039 --> 00:15:00,475
My assignment is to another unit,
but I was late for my train,

179
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:03,107
and decided to see my unit
and my lieutenant.

180
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:06,309
A soldier I met on my way
told me you were still here.

181
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:10,599
You keep eating. They didn't feed
you like that in the hospital, did they?

182
00:15:13,039 --> 00:15:14,313
So, you are going
to the rear of Germans?

183
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:19,510
Yes.

184
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:22,110
That is fun thing to do.

185
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,149
And where is Marchenko?

186
00:15:36,799 --> 00:15:38,119
May his memory live forever.

187
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:53,271
Are you going with us,
or taking your new assignment?

188
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:58,154
I'd like to stay with you,
comrade lieutenant.

189
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:01,200
You will just have to inform the division
I have been assigned to

190
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:03,394
that I am not a deserter.

191
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:07,590
Surely we will inform them.

192
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:54,558
I haven't sent it to my mother.
Will you do it for me?

193
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:58,195
You will do it yourself, comrade lieutenant,
when you return.

194
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:01,076
Let's jump.

195
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:02,190
All right.

196
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:03,469
Let's sit for a while before we go.

197
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:04,867
There is no decamouflaging sound.

198
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,872
Katia, do you know the scouts are leaving?

199
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:16,195
Katia, tonight!

200
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,073
The scout group is ready
to cross the front line.

201
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,757
Head of the group
is lieutenant Travkin.

202
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:36,108
Let's synchronize our watches.

203
00:18:37,079 --> 00:18:37,875
0:15

204
00:18:38,759 --> 00:18:39,317
Running fast.

205
00:18:40,359 --> 00:18:41,109
Move one minute back.

206
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:43,307
By 1:00 you should be
at the German trenches.

207
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,878
At 1:00 sharp
artillery will begin bombarding it.

208
00:18:47,119 --> 00:18:50,156
And don't swerve,
or else you will get under my shells.

209
00:18:51,079 --> 00:18:53,991
If by 1:00 you don't reach it,
come back at once.

210
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:54,871
Do you understand?

211
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:55,557
Yeah.

212
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:59,998
If I see your red flare, I will start bombarding
targets 7, 9, and 11 to cover your retreat.

213
00:19:00,519 --> 00:19:01,669
I see.

214
00:19:02,079 --> 00:19:03,068
Are the sappers ready?

215
00:19:03,359 --> 00:19:04,474
Yes.

216
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,115
Listen to the battle-order!

217
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,356
According to the information we have,
the enemy is now regrouping its forces.

218
00:19:13,079 --> 00:19:15,991
Command is ordering us to scout the area
held by the enemy

219
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:18,276
and confirm the regrouping.

220
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:21,518
We should identify the targets and
wire the information to the head-quarters.

221
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:24,593
Our main mission is to find the station
of enemy troops detraining,

222
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:27,189
locate areas of tanks
and infantry concentration,

223
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:31,313
reveal the find out the enemy's intentions
on the particular sector of the front.

224
00:19:33,119 --> 00:19:34,633
I remind you that during the raid

225
00:19:34,839 --> 00:19:37,957
you are forbidden to go into action
against the enemy and take captives

226
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,038
to avoid detection.

227
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:42,715
Follow me.

228
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,193
Crawl to the forest.

229
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:39,594
Comrade Captain,
"the first" will be talking to you.

230
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:41,875
Listening.

231
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,153
So, how is it going there?

232
00:24:44,839 --> 00:24:45,954
It looks like they've made it.

233
00:24:46,079 --> 00:24:46,796
Well done.

234
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:48,951
Report on the situation every hour.

235
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:52,473
Today at 22:00
the commander in chief ordered

236
00:24:52,599 --> 00:24:55,160
to pay special attention to your operation.

237
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:56,673
I got it.

238
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,118
That way.

239
00:25:48,279 --> 00:25:49,554
There's a swamp there.

240
00:25:49,799 --> 00:25:50,549
Just go.

241
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,115
Come on, go, go!

242
00:29:33,359 --> 00:29:35,112
"The Earth", come in. I am "Star".

243
00:29:37,119 --> 00:29:40,156
"The Earth", come in. I am "Star".
How do you hear me? Over.

244
00:29:55,119 --> 00:29:57,349
"The Earth", come in. I am "Star".
How do you hear me? Over.

245
00:29:58,359 --> 00:29:59,712
I hear you, "Star".

246
00:30:00,119 --> 00:30:01,519
Transmitting, 21 eagle-owl 2.

247
00:30:02,039 --> 00:30:03,836
Transmitting, 21 eagle-owl 2.

248
00:30:04,599 --> 00:30:05,588
Do you get me, "The Earth". Over.

249
00:30:06,119 --> 00:30:08,587
"Star", I got you - 21 eagle-owl 2.

250
00:30:08,839 --> 00:30:10,955
"Star", I got you - 21 eagle-owl 2.

251
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:14,871
I repeat, very many 21 eagle-owl 2.

252
00:30:16,319 --> 00:30:17,069
Did you get me? Over.

253
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:19,111
I got you, "Star".

254
00:30:19,799 --> 00:30:23,509
Very many 21 eagle-owl 2, very many.

255
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:28,117
Yeah, guys,
this sort of life is worth living.

256
00:30:38,119 --> 00:30:39,234
I want to smoke.

257
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:12,269
S.S. units.

258
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:16,912
Doesn't look like defense to me.

259
00:31:25,759 --> 00:31:30,310
There at the path there is a cart with food

260
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:32,356
and only two Germans guarding it.

261
00:31:33,319 --> 00:31:34,469
Let me do away with them.
I will do it without a shot.

262
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:55,595
We should eat something.

263
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:57,199
We haven't had
anything to eat for a whole day.

264
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:01,914
Let them pass.

265
00:32:03,039 --> 00:32:05,792
Comrade lieutenant, please.

266
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:07,393
We can't.

267
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,228
Needs be buried.

268
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:13,469
I will go and see what it is all about.

269
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:15,353
Don't.

270
00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:18,347
It is dawning.

271
00:34:37,079 --> 00:34:38,831
Does it hurt?

272
00:34:39,159 --> 00:34:41,753
My leg came numb.
It is nothing. It will go away.

273
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:09,956
We must get this German

274
00:35:12,119 --> 00:35:13,951
He is wounded, coming from hospital.

275
00:35:14,039 --> 00:35:15,358
They won't start looking for him.

276
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:19,074
Should I also go.

277
00:35:19,239 --> 00:35:20,467
You stay and guard the radio.

278
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:22,994
But why, comrade lieutenant?

279
00:35:23,079 --> 00:35:24,034
It is not to be debated.

280
00:36:49,519 --> 00:36:50,713
Heavy.

281
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:11,273
What division are you from?

282
00:37:27,519 --> 00:37:30,956
Infantry division 131, sapper company.

283
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:32,838
Did you see S.S. units?

284
00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:43,030
He says there are many of them.

285
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:44,393
They are everywhere.

286
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,353
Which units?

287
00:37:57,199 --> 00:37:58,952
Tank division "Viking",

288
00:37:59,159 --> 00:38:00,956
and elite units of Himler.

289
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:04,789
Others?

290
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,228
He doesn't know.

291
00:38:26,039 --> 00:38:29,748
He says he is a worker, not a nazi.

292
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:40,036
He says he is from Leipzig,
he is not an S.S.

293
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:54,070
He is asking not to kill him.

294
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:57,829
Brazhnikov.

295
00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:06,992
And take the sparrow with you.

296
00:39:39,079 --> 00:39:41,150
Sparrow, look around
just to be on the safe side.

297
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:04,793
This happens.

298
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:29,315
Again night shift.

299
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:32,518
May I come in?

300
00:40:35,719 --> 00:40:36,469
Hello.

301
00:40:36,719 --> 00:40:37,391
Hello.

302
00:40:42,679 --> 00:40:43,590
I'll go.

303
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:51,476
What's with him?

304
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:52,829
Is he alive?

305
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:54,710
Who?

306
00:40:55,039 --> 00:40:55,869
Travkin.

307
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:58,987
Of course.

308
00:41:03,239 --> 00:41:05,150
What is wrong, Katia?

309
00:41:07,199 --> 00:41:08,518
What is wrong with you?

310
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:14,150
I thought something happened to him.

311
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:20,675
Don't cry.

312
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:23,273
Soon the war will be over.

313
00:41:24,559 --> 00:41:26,914
The frontier is close
and Berlin is not far.

314
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:30,554
We must live.

315
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,831
We are not the only ones suffering.

316
00:41:35,159 --> 00:41:35,989
No.

317
00:41:38,039 --> 00:41:38,789
No.

318
00:42:00,159 --> 00:42:03,072
There is a drunk dead German
lying around at the road.

319
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:04,599
And they call themselves a higher race.

320
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:05,954
Should we have a look?

321
00:42:13,199 --> 00:42:14,349
Isn't he good?

322
00:42:18,119 --> 00:42:19,791
What else could I do?

323
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,228
Should I have given myself up to him?

324
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:24,311
He was coming right towards me.
Do you understand?

325
00:42:26,079 --> 00:42:27,559
What on earth have you done?

326
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:28,755
Now they will know about us.

327
00:42:29,119 --> 00:42:30,791
He came to me himself.

328
00:42:32,119 --> 00:42:33,552
Ok, ok. We'll settle it.

329
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:35,193
Let's carry him away.

330
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:38,239
He is a real S. S, an officer.

331
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:39,838
He must know everything.

332
00:42:40,639 --> 00:42:41,675
Look at him.

333
00:42:43,119 --> 00:42:45,235
Everybody takes prisoners,
and I still can't.

334
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,148
Don't worry, Sparrow.

335
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:49,349
There are a lot of them here.

336
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,228
Soon you'll manage to do it.

337
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:07,150
Wow!

338
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:09,108
An interesting sort of defense.

339
00:43:10,079 --> 00:43:11,195
And what is this?

340
00:43:13,079 --> 00:43:14,148
A railway station.

341
00:43:23,039 --> 00:43:25,507
On the 10th of the current month

342
00:43:25,719 --> 00:43:29,268
an officer of "Viking" division
headquarters disappeared.

343
00:43:30,039 --> 00:43:32,634
His dead body was found
8 km away from headquarters.

344
00:43:33,119 --> 00:43:35,394
It appears that his death
was caused by an accident,

345
00:43:35,519 --> 00:43:37,199
however there are grounds to believe

346
00:43:37,199 --> 00:43:39,030
that he was killed by the green ghosts

347
00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:41,509
that were spotted at the front line.

348
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:45,032
All the units of S.S,
Wermacht and Guard in the area

349
00:43:45,199 --> 00:43:47,838
are ordered to undertake
all possible measures

350
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:51,958
to locate and liquidate
the enemy scout group.

351
00:43:52,719 --> 00:43:53,869
I repeat,

352
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,833
this is possibly
the location enemy troops detraining.

353
00:43:57,159 --> 00:43:59,878
We are continuing moving
in the planned direction.

354
00:44:00,119 --> 00:44:01,996
"Star", this is "The Earth".

355
00:44:02,199 --> 00:44:07,193
We warmly embrace you.
Did you get me?

356
00:44:08,119 --> 00:44:09,188
Did you get me?

357
00:44:10,119 --> 00:44:11,757
Come back soon.

358
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:13,268
Please.

359
00:44:20,239 --> 00:44:21,309
It is full.

360
00:44:22,199 --> 00:44:23,427
Let's go to the other truck.

361
00:44:26,559 --> 00:44:28,277
Looks like a transport to the station.

362
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:39,427
Anikanov,

363
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,115
Bikov and you,

364
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:46,550
take Sparrow with you to listen...

365
00:44:48,159 --> 00:44:49,956
Your task is to check ways
to approach the station.

366
00:44:50,559 --> 00:44:52,356
Don't get yourselves into anything.

367
00:44:52,519 --> 00:44:54,032
The rally point is here.

368
00:44:54,199 --> 00:44:55,188
At the edge of the settlement.

369
00:44:55,840 --> 00:44:56,875
Any questions?

370
00:44:57,199 --> 00:44:57,791
No.

371
00:44:58,039 --> 00:44:59,268
Then, do it.

372
00:46:56,119 --> 00:46:57,393
Don'be afraid, Sparrow.

373
00:46:58,000 --> 00:46:59,273
Only 10 km is left to my home.

374
00:47:00,599 --> 00:47:01,827
We are gonna make it.

375
00:48:39,239 --> 00:48:40,467
What?

376
00:48:41,559 --> 00:48:43,039
The radio.

377
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:44,833
I failed to protect it.

378
00:48:48,599 --> 00:48:49,998
The radio, Lieutenant.

379
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:51,994
Easy, easy.

380
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:14,750
They are ours.

381
00:54:31,360 --> 00:54:32,588
Follow me.

382
00:55:22,840 --> 00:55:24,239
Wait. Look.

383
00:55:26,199 --> 00:55:27,552
The tanks.

384
00:55:27,960 --> 00:55:29,393
The tanks are fake.

385
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:20,398
Bykov, wounded?

386
00:57:26,239 --> 00:57:27,467
Wait.

387
00:57:28,239 --> 00:57:29,228
I can do it myself.

388
00:57:37,199 --> 00:57:38,599
Don't die.

389
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:40,114
Don't die.

390
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:45,315
My home is near here.

391
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:47,034
I will get there anyway.

392
00:57:55,199 --> 00:57:57,235
During bombing of the railway station

393
00:57:57,440 --> 00:58:00,398
an officer was stubbed to death
with a Russian army knife.

394
00:58:01,039 --> 00:58:03,838
It is essential to increase efforts

395
00:58:04,199 --> 00:58:07,875
and liquidate the enemy scout
group as soon as possible.

396
00:58:54,199 --> 00:58:56,668
There is nobody around.
I've checked everywhere.

397
00:58:58,599 --> 00:59:00,510
Comrade Lieutenant.
Let me look for them.

398
00:59:00,599 --> 00:59:01,668
Maybe they got lost.

399
00:59:08,039 --> 00:59:11,237
No. We'll wait here.

400
01:00:42,039 --> 01:00:45,237
Comrade lieutenant.
This is not that station.

401
01:00:46,800 --> 01:00:47,755
What?

402
01:00:49,840 --> 01:00:52,307
This station is there just to draw away
our attention off the real one.

403
01:00:53,760 --> 01:00:56,320
In fact, Germans detrain the tanks
at night in a quarry.

404
01:00:57,039 --> 01:00:58,358
Here you can read it.

405
01:01:02,119 --> 01:01:04,838
Maybe it's worth
going there and seeing for ourselves.

406
01:01:09,280 --> 01:01:12,157
Yes, we should do it.

407
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:15,273
Let's go, Kostia.

408
01:02:21,760 --> 01:02:23,795
Should we get the officer?

409
01:02:25,159 --> 01:02:27,833
But lieutenant told us
not to take prisoners.

410
01:02:28,320 --> 01:02:30,038
Lieutenant will forgive us.

411
01:02:31,119 --> 01:02:33,998
We'll do it fast and then will go home.

412
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,559
Ok, let's do it.

413
01:02:43,079 --> 01:02:44,672
We'll do it. We can do it.

414
01:05:02,199 --> 01:05:05,077
A good German.
An important one.

415
01:05:05,519 --> 01:05:07,112
From their head-quarters.

416
01:05:12,159 --> 01:05:13,387
Give him some home-brew.

417
01:05:15,480 --> 01:05:16,798
Make sure he is well.
Get it?

418
01:05:17,119 --> 01:05:18,393
Yeah.

419
01:05:21,239 --> 01:05:23,309
I wonder
when the counter-offensive will begin.

420
01:05:23,679 --> 01:05:24,715
Ask him once more.

421
01:05:36,320 --> 01:05:38,038
He says he won't
answer our questions.

422
01:05:46,159 --> 01:05:47,114
This seems to be it.

423
01:05:49,960 --> 01:05:52,155
A large-scale offensive....

424
01:05:55,320 --> 01:05:58,471
Hitler considers very important...

425
01:06:00,320 --> 01:06:04,233
Transfer of two S.S. tank divisions...

426
01:06:06,599 --> 01:06:09,637
Concentration of forces
should be finished

427
01:06:11,159 --> 01:06:12,478
in two days...

428
01:06:12,800 --> 01:06:14,518
Our people
don't know anything about it.

429
01:06:14,639 --> 01:06:16,197
We won't be able
to inform them about it.

430
01:06:19,119 --> 01:06:20,074
We must.

431
01:06:35,119 --> 01:06:36,871
In the location, where German
troops secretly concentrate

432
01:06:37,039 --> 01:06:38,791
for massive and unexpected
counter-offensive

433
01:06:38,960 --> 01:06:40,632
against Russian troops on both fronts,

434
01:06:40,880 --> 01:06:43,393
operates an experienced
Russian scout group,

435
01:06:43,599 --> 01:06:46,068
that has obtained
significant strategic information.

436
01:06:47,119 --> 01:06:48,235
I order

437
01:06:48,559 --> 01:06:55,431
all military units in the area to
provide personnel for operation "Trap"

438
01:06:55,840 --> 01:07:03,189
and undertake all measures possible to
locate and liquidate the enemy scout group.

439
01:07:04,600 --> 01:07:10,675
10.000 troops will be involved
in the operation and also...

440
01:07:11,640 --> 01:07:14,029
"Star", I am "The Earth".

441
01:07:14,520 --> 01:07:16,430
Do you hear me? Over.

442
01:07:19,239 --> 01:07:20,719
"Star", "Star"..

443
01:07:20,840 --> 01:07:21,590
Comrade...

444
01:07:21,800 --> 01:07:23,153
At ease.

445
01:07:30,560 --> 01:07:35,350
"Star", I am "The Earth".
Do you hear me? Over.

446
01:07:45,039 --> 01:07:46,597
You should go
and have some sleep.

447
01:07:56,079 --> 01:08:03,110
"Star", I am "The Earth".
Do you hear me? Over.

448
01:08:26,760 --> 01:08:28,193
A radio transmitter.

449
01:08:37,920 --> 01:08:39,113
We should take it.

450
01:08:39,199 --> 01:08:40,474
And fight with whole German army...

451
01:08:41,039 --> 01:08:41,949
Why the whole army...

452
01:08:42,199 --> 01:08:44,475
We can do it quietly.

453
01:08:46,079 --> 01:08:48,229
We need to get
a radio transmitter at all costs,

454
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:51,479
Or else all we did is in vain.

455
01:09:24,199 --> 01:09:25,234
Let's go.

456
01:09:55,279 --> 01:09:57,110
I don't see the switch.

457
01:10:14,119 --> 01:10:16,680
"Star", "Star", I am "The Earth"...

458
01:10:16,840 --> 01:10:18,989
For as long as I live,
Hitler will tremble with fear.

459
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:40,228
You, bustard.

460
01:10:48,359 --> 01:10:51,396
Breathe, sparrow, breathe.

461
01:11:32,239 --> 01:11:34,310
Don't die, Sparrow, don't die.

462
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:42,114
Faster.

463
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:58,399
Go, go.

464
01:12:06,119 --> 01:12:07,757
They've spoiled a good thing.

465
01:12:17,079 --> 01:12:17,989
Let's get out.

466
01:12:18,239 --> 01:12:19,309
I will lead them away.

467
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:53,228
Just be calm.

468
01:14:51,039 --> 01:14:52,109
Seven.

469
01:14:52,880 --> 01:14:53,994
Eight.

470
01:16:36,079 --> 01:16:36,876
Sparrow!

471
01:16:39,119 --> 01:16:40,472
How are you, Sparrow?

472
01:16:41,199 --> 01:16:43,430
Breathe, breathe.

473
01:16:45,920 --> 01:16:48,149
Breathe, breathe.

474
01:16:49,319 --> 01:16:50,149
What?

475
01:16:51,039 --> 01:16:51,836
What?

476
01:16:55,279 --> 01:16:57,077
Left...left handle.

477
01:16:57,880 --> 01:17:00,632
Left...left handle.

478
01:17:14,319 --> 01:17:16,275
"The Earth", I am "Star".

479
01:17:16,720 --> 01:17:17,788
Do you hear me? Over.

480
01:17:18,199 --> 01:17:19,757
Breathe, breathe.

481
01:17:26,159 --> 01:17:31,109
"The Earth", I am "Star".
Do you hear me? Over.

482
01:17:42,359 --> 01:17:45,875
"The Earth", I am "Star".
Do you hear me? Over.

483
01:17:50,920 --> 01:17:54,310
"The Earth", I am "Star".
Do you hear me? Over.

484
01:18:03,199 --> 01:18:08,149
"The Earth", I am "Star".
Reply to "Star".

485
01:21:58,920 --> 01:22:01,514
Get to the radio, Lieutenant.

486
01:22:02,319 --> 01:22:04,435
Keep calling.

487
01:22:18,239 --> 01:22:22,836
"The Earth", I am "Star".
Do you hear me? Over.

488
01:22:23,199 --> 01:22:27,351
"The Earth", I am "Star".
Do you hear me? Over.

489
01:22:27,560 --> 01:22:30,518
"The Earth", I am "Star".
Do you hear me? Over.

490
01:22:42,359 --> 01:22:43,109
What?

491
01:22:43,239 --> 01:22:45,275
Sniper.
On the left, behind the tree.

492
01:22:54,279 --> 01:22:56,918
"The Earth", I am "Star".
Do you hear me? Over.

493
01:22:57,479 --> 01:23:00,198
"The Earth", I am "Star".
Do you hear me? Over.

494
01:23:01,079 --> 01:23:02,399
I can hear you, "Star".

495
01:23:04,439 --> 01:23:05,918
I am "The Earth", over.

496
01:23:06,319 --> 01:23:07,639
"The Earth", receive information.

497
01:23:08,199 --> 01:23:13,149
In the area is concentrating
the 5th tank division "Viking"....,

498
01:23:16,159 --> 01:23:18,195
10th motor regiment "Germany",
9th division...

499
01:23:19,039 --> 01:23:20,712
5th artillery regiment.

500
01:23:27,159 --> 01:23:30,993
They are secretly moving forces
from other areas of the front.

501
01:23:31,159 --> 01:23:33,150
"The Earth", did you get it?

502
01:23:55,079 --> 01:23:56,512
Ammo.

503
01:23:57,079 --> 01:23:58,717
Give me some ammo.

504
01:24:13,359 --> 01:24:16,396
The grouping consists of
40000 troops and 2000 tanks.

505
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:21,117
The task of the enemy
is to disjoin our...

506
01:24:27,520 --> 01:24:33,310
The troops and tanks
are being detrained at the quarry.

507
01:24:34,319 --> 01:24:36,230
The operation is scheduled
to begin on the 16th of...

508
01:24:40,479 --> 01:24:42,356
At 4 o'clock in the morning.

509
01:26:05,079 --> 01:26:06,512
Get up!

510
01:26:09,479 --> 01:26:11,993
It is a pretty bad thing to die, lieutenant.

511
01:27:21,199 --> 01:27:22,519
Good afternoon.

512
01:27:26,039 --> 01:27:29,112
"Star", "Star", I am "The Earth".

513
01:27:30,720 --> 01:27:32,278
Reply to "The Earth".

514
01:27:36,119 --> 01:27:37,951
"Star", "Star".

515
01:27:38,239 --> 01:27:40,310
Tomorrow the offensive will begin,

516
01:27:40,520 --> 01:27:42,158
the radio will be switched off.

517
01:28:00,239 --> 01:28:02,355
"Star", "Star", I am "The Earth".

518
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:04,512
Reply to "The Earth". Over.

519
01:28:08,159 --> 01:28:11,913
"Star", "Star", I am "The Earth".

520
01:28:13,039 --> 01:28:15,155
Reply to "The Earth". Over.

521
01:28:18,239 --> 01:28:20,195
"Star", "Star", I am "The Earth".

522
01:28:21,920 --> 01:28:23,751
Reply to "The Earth". Over.

523
01:28:26,039 --> 01:28:28,952
The information received from Travkin
was very important for the division.

524
01:28:29,079 --> 01:28:34,676
The report went to the front-headquarters
and from there to General Headquarters.

525
01:28:35,880 --> 01:28:39,155
German counter-offensive was foiled.

526
01:28:40,600 --> 01:28:42,875
Poland was released.

527
01:28:43,159 --> 01:28:47,438
The price paid for it was the lives
of half a million of Red Army soldiers.

528
01:28:48,680 --> 01:28:53,195
I, captain Andrei Barashkin,
died near Visla river.

529
01:28:54,880 --> 01:28:56,551
Katia Simakova lived to see the victory;

530
01:28:57,119 --> 01:29:01,078
returned to her little town and worked
in a local school as a history teacher.

531
01:29:02,039 --> 01:29:04,189
She never married.

532
01:29:05,800 --> 01:29:09,554
The scout group
was for a long time considered lost.

533
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:16,869
Requests of relatives got the same reply:
"There is no further information..."

534
01:29:18,079 --> 01:29:24,234
Only in 1964 all the scouts were rewarded
orders of World War Two of the 1st grade.

535
01:29:24,960 --> 01:29:26,279
Posthumously.

536
01:29:27,079 --> 01:29:30,117
But every spring,
every May,

537
01:29:30,359 --> 01:29:35,069
the souls of the fallen on the fields
of Poland, Germany, and everywhere

538
01:29:35,560 --> 01:29:42,636
go back to their homes to see their blooming
motherland they gave their lives for.
