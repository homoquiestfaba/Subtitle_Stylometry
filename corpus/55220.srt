1
00:02:44,631 --> 00:02:45,928
Jesus!

2
00:02:46,099 --> 00:02:49,398
Cease fire! Cease fire!

3
00:02:49,569 --> 00:02:51,901
You sons of bitches!

4
00:02:52,071 --> 00:02:54,767
- You almost blew my head off!
- Sorry, Beckett.

5
00:02:54,941 --> 00:02:57,409
- What's wrong with you?
- I saw something.

6
00:02:57,577 --> 00:02:59,807
I thought I saw it too.

7
00:02:59,979 --> 00:03:02,140
Christ, man.

8
00:03:02,315 --> 00:03:05,842
You thought you saw something?

9
00:03:07,387 --> 00:03:09,582
I saw a deer, maybe.

10
00:03:09,756 --> 00:03:11,314
A deer, maybe.

11
00:03:11,491 --> 00:03:15,393
Do I look like a fucking deer
to you, asswipe?

12
00:03:29,275 --> 00:03:32,506
- Where are they?
- Probably lost. No, they are lost.

13
00:03:32,679 --> 00:03:35,512
- I've gotta find them.
- Shouldn't be too difficult...

14
00:03:35,682 --> 00:03:38,651
...you being the great white hunter
and all.

15
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:43,446
- You can't just leave like this.
- Watch me.

16
00:03:43,623 --> 00:03:47,081
They'll want refunds.
It's coming out of your check.

17
00:03:47,327 --> 00:03:49,659
Fine. I'm tired of dealing
with assholes...

18
00:03:49,829 --> 00:03:53,560
...paying to shoot caged animals.
- Not sporting enough for you?

19
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:57,294
I suppose the people you picked off
had a better chance?

20
00:03:57,470 --> 00:04:00,997
Every man I killed could as easily
have killed me.

21
00:05:36,602 --> 00:05:38,467
Military Intelligence.

22
00:05:38,638 --> 00:05:40,868
- Thomas Beckett?
- Do I know you?

23
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:44,532
I'm Colonel Dan McKenna.
This is James Eckles. He's with...

24
00:05:44,711 --> 00:05:46,406
CIA?

25
00:05:46,846 --> 00:05:48,108
How'd you know?

26
00:05:48,514 --> 00:05:51,347
I don't know. You just
kind of got that look.

27
00:05:51,517 --> 00:05:53,485
Do you have a minute for us?

28
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:55,445
Sorry.

29
00:05:56,489 --> 00:06:00,619
Boy, you've bounced around
a bit since your discharge.

30
00:06:00,793 --> 00:06:02,420
Had trouble holding a job...

31
00:06:02,595 --> 00:06:06,531
Trouble holding a relationship,
trouble sleeping past 6 a.m.

32
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:09,259
Trouble adjusting.
Trouble with my pension...

33
00:06:09,435 --> 00:06:12,097
- Mr. Beckett.
- Sir.

34
00:06:12,271 --> 00:06:17,265
I understand your difficulties, and I'm
sorry. But that's not why we're here.

35
00:06:17,744 --> 00:06:20,679
You won the Kodiak marksmanship
tournament last month.

36
00:06:20,847 --> 00:06:24,078
You beat the Marine Corps team
and seven SWAT members.

37
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:26,878
So? What are you,
the awards committee?

38
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:30,318
- No. We need a sniper, a good one.
- The best.

39
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:38,761
Didn't my dossier happen to mention
my medical discharge, unfit for duty...?

40
00:06:38,931 --> 00:06:41,627
Apparently they made a mistake.

41
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:49,675
How is it your proposition entails hiring
a 50-year-old former scout sniper?

42
00:06:49,842 --> 00:06:51,707
Can we talk about this?

43
00:06:52,845 --> 00:06:56,747
Everyone figures the Balkans are clean
since we took Milosevic down.

44
00:06:56,916 --> 00:07:00,818
But there are others like him
waiting for us to turn our backs.

45
00:07:00,987 --> 00:07:05,890
Our Intelligence has tracked resistance
in what NATO calls "no man's land."

46
00:07:06,058 --> 00:07:10,085
They're led by a rogue general
named Mulik Valstoria.

47
00:07:12,498 --> 00:07:17,060
He's commander of what he likes
to call the "23rd Home Guard."

48
00:07:17,236 --> 00:07:20,501
Look, this guy is running
a stealth operation...

49
00:07:20,673 --> 00:07:24,473
...of ethnic cleansing
in Muslim towns along the border.

50
00:07:24,644 --> 00:07:29,172
We're removing the general before
it escalates into something bigger.

51
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:32,577
Well, why me?

52
00:07:32,985 --> 00:07:37,081
Why not Heister or Baker?
Those jarheads are still doing tours.

53
00:07:37,256 --> 00:07:41,090
- This one's off the books.
- You've got an impressive career.

54
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:44,718
Former record holder on the long shot,
1.1 miles.

55
00:07:44,897 --> 00:07:47,889
Baker broke it. Hit an al Qaeda
guard at 1.24 miles.

56
00:07:48,067 --> 00:07:51,230
No, the record's 1.47.

57
00:07:51,404 --> 00:07:53,634
A Cuban general
near Guantanamo Bay.

58
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:56,975
A Cuban general hit a man
at a mile and a half?

59
00:07:57,143 --> 00:08:00,874
I killed a Cuban general
at a mile and a half.

60
00:08:01,047 --> 00:08:05,484
- That's the record, for the record.
- Look, I'm not gonna bullshit you.

61
00:08:05,651 --> 00:08:08,142
- This is gonna be tough.
- You mean suicide.

62
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:12,018
There's a group of separatists
in Gilau that'll help you.

63
00:08:12,191 --> 00:08:15,524
I used to do this because
I was following orders...

64
00:08:15,695 --> 00:08:17,322
...but what's in it for me?

65
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:22,491
The risk is great. We're authorized
to offer you anything you like.

66
00:08:22,768 --> 00:08:25,566
- Anything?
- Anything.

67
00:08:27,106 --> 00:08:28,573
Look here.

68
00:08:29,775 --> 00:08:32,266
If you're willing
to offer me anything...

69
00:08:32,445 --> 00:08:37,144
...then I have to assume
that you don't plan to pay off.

70
00:08:37,316 --> 00:08:39,978
You've already chalked me up
for dead.

71
00:08:44,423 --> 00:08:45,685
Yeah.

72
00:08:45,858 --> 00:08:48,759
But then I look around here,
and...

73
00:08:50,696 --> 00:08:53,028
So you'll do it?

74
00:08:55,134 --> 00:08:58,900
You know, whenever I do die,
I want it to be as a Marine.

75
00:08:59,071 --> 00:09:01,631
So, what I want
is my former rank back.

76
00:09:01,807 --> 00:09:06,301
I wouldn't expect you to understand
that, but I know you do, sir.

77
00:09:06,479 --> 00:09:08,640
So do we have a deal?

78
00:09:10,349 --> 00:09:12,681
Yes, we do,
master gunnery sergeant.

79
00:09:14,787 --> 00:09:16,755
Roger that, sir.

80
00:09:16,923 --> 00:09:18,788
All right...

81
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:23,395
A mission like this into hostile territory,
gotta be a two-man operation.

82
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:28,296
So, what I want
is a good observer.

83
00:09:29,135 --> 00:09:34,402
AMERICAN EMBASS Y BERLIN
10:05

84
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:39,705
Colonel McKenna.

85
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:43,575
Good. Send him in.

86
00:09:45,217 --> 00:09:47,913
He's here. They brought him
straight from the plane.

87
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:52,581
How is a man in the joint for killing
a federal officer suddenly cut loose?

88
00:09:52,758 --> 00:09:54,726
It's not easy, believe me.

89
00:09:54,894 --> 00:09:57,863
It seems to me he'll stick out
like a sore thumb.

90
00:09:59,632 --> 00:10:01,259
Come in.

91
00:10:04,537 --> 00:10:07,370
Reporting with Mr. Cole
as ordered, sir.

92
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:08,939
Thank you, gunny.

93
00:10:18,684 --> 00:10:20,276
Sit down, Mr. Cole.

94
00:10:33,265 --> 00:10:34,527
Freedom.

95
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:37,897
- Shall I refresh your memory?
- I don't need no refreshing.

96
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:39,332
One mission.

97
00:10:39,505 --> 00:10:45,171
If I fail or try to escape or even
take a shit where you say I can't...

98
00:10:45,344 --> 00:10:48,074
...it's back to death row, right?

99
00:10:49,715 --> 00:10:52,684
Master Gunnery Sergeant Beckett...

100
00:10:52,852 --> 00:10:55,082
...meet Jake Cole.

101
00:10:56,589 --> 00:10:58,784
I don't think he likes me.

102
00:10:59,225 --> 00:11:01,489
Must be that Army thing.

103
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:03,185
No.

104
00:11:04,964 --> 00:11:09,298
Colonel, Mr. Eckles, may I have a word
with this man in private?

105
00:11:09,468 --> 00:11:11,936
By all means,
master gunnery sergeant.

106
00:11:27,887 --> 00:11:31,345
Says here you speak the lingo
where we're going.

107
00:11:33,092 --> 00:11:36,926
Enough to keep your sorry old ass
out of trouble.

108
00:11:40,666 --> 00:11:45,194
- And you were an Army sniper?
- Former Delta, 85-41 out of Quantico.

109
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:47,931
Urban sniper, SOTG.

110
00:11:48,107 --> 00:11:50,234
Seven real-world missions.

111
00:11:50,409 --> 00:11:53,845
Four as an observer,
three as a shooter.

112
00:11:54,013 --> 00:11:56,379
Three confirmed.

113
00:11:56,982 --> 00:11:59,416
Couple questions, sergeant.

114
00:12:00,152 --> 00:12:03,246
We're at 750 yards
at a 19-degree angle.

115
00:12:03,422 --> 00:12:06,220
What's the difference between
the points of aim and impact?

116
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:10,021
- Well, how tall's the target, man?
- Five feet, 10 inches.

117
00:12:13,299 --> 00:12:15,767
23.17 inches high.

118
00:12:15,935 --> 00:12:19,427
And you'll need to dial six
up three.

119
00:12:21,807 --> 00:12:24,935
And when your time comes,
what will you say?

120
00:12:26,846 --> 00:12:31,579
I ain't gonna say nothing.
I'll just shut up and die like a soldier.

121
00:12:35,154 --> 00:12:39,557
Roger. Verify touchdown of Snake Eater
at ballpark at 1500. Over.

122
00:12:39,725 --> 00:12:42,057
Roger. Touchdown Snake Eater.

123
00:12:42,228 --> 00:12:45,095
Big Eye verifying ballpark
is clear. Over.

124
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:48,097
Roger. I copy. Out.

125
00:12:49,201 --> 00:12:51,795
You ever try using one of these?

126
00:12:53,873 --> 00:12:56,501
No. Still use a compass.

127
00:12:56,675 --> 00:12:59,143
Just old-school, I guess.

128
00:13:01,514 --> 00:13:04,608
Rendezvous points, radio freqs
as per S.O.P.

129
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:08,447
Two minutes out.
Initiating approach.

130
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:10,213
Roger that.

131
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:14,886
Once again, we drop in here,
seven clicks from Gilau.

132
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:17,722
At St. Stephan's church,
we meet our contact.

133
00:13:17,897 --> 00:13:21,526
The partisans will provide us
with weapons and photos.

134
00:13:22,034 --> 00:13:25,629
It's too bad it's not the Basilica.
I'd like to see that.

135
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:28,706
- Say again?
- The Basilica of Gilau.

136
00:13:28,874 --> 00:13:33,140
It's one of the most beautiful
Byzantine churches in Eastern Europe.

137
00:13:33,846 --> 00:13:37,873
I spent a lot of time reading
travel books and shit in prison.

138
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:43,044
I must have read every AAA Guide
and National Geographic ever printed.

139
00:13:43,222 --> 00:13:44,712
Why?

140
00:13:45,624 --> 00:13:47,558
To keep the dream alive.

141
00:13:47,726 --> 00:13:50,661
It's pretty easy to let them break you
in the house.

142
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:55,324
Most guys on the row are actually
looking forward to the day they die.

143
00:13:56,468 --> 00:14:00,234
We're here to put a bullet
in a man and let God sort it out.

144
00:14:00,406 --> 00:14:03,898
You better just pray we get
out of this country alive.

145
00:14:04,076 --> 00:14:07,409
All your dream shit... stops here.

146
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:10,212
30 seconds to drop.

147
00:14:10,382 --> 00:14:11,849
Roger.

148
00:15:05,137 --> 00:15:08,629
Aviano AFB, Sicily

149
00:15:08,807 --> 00:15:10,900
Snake Eater,
specify transmission. Over.

150
00:15:11,076 --> 00:15:14,978
- Getting a lot of interference.
- Home run. Snake Eater out.

151
00:15:15,147 --> 00:15:17,547
- Any problems?
- Negative.

152
00:15:20,185 --> 00:15:24,212
They should make contact at 1630.

153
00:16:07,533 --> 00:16:09,967
Remove your cover.

154
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:36,727
I am the one you are looking for.

155
00:16:37,863 --> 00:16:41,424
She's our contact.
Goddamn!

156
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,966
Get on your knees, son...

157
00:16:44,803 --> 00:16:47,636
...while I pray for your soul.

158
00:16:51,043 --> 00:16:53,375
My name is Sophia.

159
00:16:54,279 --> 00:16:58,079
We were expecting someone...
older.

160
00:16:59,051 --> 00:17:02,282
Not many people grow old
in this business.

161
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:07,356
Did you bring our package?

162
00:17:16,969 --> 00:17:19,938
The photo of Valstoria
is only a few days old.

163
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:25,071
The others are of the buildings
around the Ministry of Defense.

164
00:17:25,244 --> 00:17:30,511
The one with the corner window
is very high and close.

165
00:17:38,757 --> 00:17:41,123
A clear shot.

166
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:48,898
I think maybe that is where
you want to be.

167
00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:54,168
I'll decide that.

168
00:18:05,451 --> 00:18:07,681
It's nearly 300 meters away.

169
00:18:07,853 --> 00:18:10,287
Maybe it's too far.

170
00:18:10,456 --> 00:18:14,483
- Three hundred and twenty-six yards.
- I agree with her.

171
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:17,424
We should be closer to the action.

172
00:18:18,464 --> 00:18:20,364
You just call it,
I'll hit it.

173
00:18:20,532 --> 00:18:25,435
Valstoria arrives at the ministry
every other morning, 7:30 exactly.

174
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:27,231
He will walk up the steps.

175
00:18:27,406 --> 00:18:31,365
It's six meters
from the car to the building.

176
00:18:32,644 --> 00:18:35,579
- And he's 184 centimeters tall?
- Yes.

177
00:18:36,582 --> 00:18:38,880
I'll need a guitar case.

178
00:18:45,324 --> 00:18:50,352
As you can see, the streets in this part
of the city are very narrow and old.

179
00:18:50,529 --> 00:18:53,589
It will not be easy to escape.

180
00:19:02,708 --> 00:19:05,871
Sergeant Beckett's rifle
was our one priority.

181
00:19:06,044 --> 00:19:08,877
That's the best we have
with our limitations.

182
00:19:09,248 --> 00:19:11,614
No, it'll do just fine.

183
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:16,454
I must leave to make sure
everything is arranged.

184
00:19:16,855 --> 00:19:20,814
The city will be in chaos.
You need to get to the church.

185
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:23,188
It's built on top of Roman catacombs.

186
00:19:23,362 --> 00:19:25,353
We can move beneath the city.

187
00:19:25,531 --> 00:19:27,761
We'll get to the church on time.

188
00:19:27,933 --> 00:19:30,401
You just make sure you're there.

189
00:19:32,738 --> 00:19:36,071
What he means is, thank you.

190
00:19:38,043 --> 00:19:39,840
Okay.

191
00:19:49,288 --> 00:19:51,449
That Sophia...

192
00:19:51,623 --> 00:19:54,490
- Not what I expected.
- Stay in the bubble.

193
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:58,355
If the diversion device works,
we've got five minutes.

194
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:02,159
I want you shadowing me.
No sightseeing. Understood?

195
00:20:02,334 --> 00:20:07,237
- Roger that.
- Get your gear together. Let's go.

196
00:20:09,775 --> 00:20:14,144
Three hundred and twenty-eight yards.
Give me three up one.

197
00:20:14,313 --> 00:20:17,510
I've got wind coming
from the right at four to six.

198
00:20:17,683 --> 00:20:21,847
Of course, that could change
in the morning. East is at our backs.

199
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:24,352
Sunrise is at 0637.

200
00:20:24,523 --> 00:20:28,960
We could have some shadows on
the target from the buildings at 0730.

201
00:20:29,127 --> 00:20:32,187
Rig the diversion device.
Let's get out of here.

202
00:20:32,464 --> 00:20:36,594
- Where do we take the shot from?
- From the window she suggested.

203
00:20:36,768 --> 00:20:39,328
It is the perfect position.

204
00:21:17,843 --> 00:21:20,073
Catch any Z's?

205
00:21:21,747 --> 00:21:24,443
- No.
- All right.

206
00:21:26,752 --> 00:21:29,653
And who are you, my friend?

207
00:21:31,423 --> 00:21:35,018
Two hundred and eighteen yards.
Give me two up one.

208
00:21:39,364 --> 00:21:43,494
Full-value wind is one to three.
Give me a half left.

209
00:21:56,415 --> 00:21:59,907
- I got a five-degree angle.
- Don't worry about that.

210
00:22:00,085 --> 00:22:02,451
It's not enough of an angle.

211
00:22:10,962 --> 00:22:13,328
You never asked me why I did it.

212
00:22:14,399 --> 00:22:18,028
- Did what?
- Why I killed that motherfucker.

213
00:22:18,203 --> 00:22:20,535
Well, I don't condone it.

214
00:22:20,706 --> 00:22:23,641
I just don't care enough about you
to want to know.

215
00:22:28,313 --> 00:22:31,680
You got a real way about you,
don't you, master guns?

216
00:22:39,057 --> 00:22:40,581
They're here.

217
00:22:42,294 --> 00:22:45,229
Black Mercedes with escorts.

218
00:22:46,631 --> 00:22:48,155
Right on schedule.

219
00:23:01,179 --> 00:23:04,273
Bastard doesn't know
he's got less than a minute.

220
00:23:04,549 --> 00:23:06,881
If he moves,
give me half a mil lead.

221
00:23:07,052 --> 00:23:08,212
Roger.

222
00:23:09,654 --> 00:23:12,145
- Wind?
- Same.

223
00:23:20,565 --> 00:23:24,558
- Target's out and moving.
- Ready.

224
00:23:24,736 --> 00:23:28,866
Diversion's set.
Head shot. Fire.

225
00:23:33,145 --> 00:23:34,737
What's up?

226
00:23:36,815 --> 00:23:39,613
- Nothing. Ready.
- Are you sure?

227
00:23:39,785 --> 00:23:44,381
Just keep your eye on the scope
and shut the fuck up.

228
00:23:46,291 --> 00:23:47,986
Okay.

229
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:49,184
Center chest.

230
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:53,022
Fire!

231
00:23:59,404 --> 00:24:01,565
Target's down.

232
00:24:02,507 --> 00:24:03,906
Shit.

233
00:24:21,493 --> 00:24:23,017
Shit, they made us.

234
00:24:28,633 --> 00:24:32,034
There is no goddamn way
they can see us up here.

235
00:24:36,842 --> 00:24:38,605
There! There he is!

236
00:24:39,344 --> 00:24:43,144
All right, let's break down the hide
and didi out of here.

237
00:24:45,050 --> 00:24:47,177
Four blocks, we reach the church.

238
00:24:47,352 --> 00:24:49,217
- We should split up.
- Negative.

239
00:24:49,387 --> 00:24:51,719
Keep your sidearm in your hand.

240
00:24:51,890 --> 00:24:54,552
They're looking for two men.
Maybe separate...

241
00:24:54,726 --> 00:24:58,787
They'll be looking at everyone.
Stick together, we cover each other.

242
00:25:09,941 --> 00:25:11,465
Three more blocks.

243
00:25:57,589 --> 00:25:59,648
- What?
- Change of plans.

244
00:27:26,678 --> 00:27:28,339
Who was the last to get on?

245
00:27:28,613 --> 00:27:30,478
The gentleman and two others.

246
00:27:44,262 --> 00:27:46,127
Your identification, please.

247
00:27:47,265 --> 00:27:48,289
Sure.

248
00:27:54,906 --> 00:27:56,396
Cover him.

249
00:27:57,175 --> 00:27:58,267
On the floor!

250
00:28:42,821 --> 00:28:44,413
We've got company!

251
00:28:47,258 --> 00:28:48,987
Coming up fast!

252
00:29:40,078 --> 00:29:41,943
Left! Left!

253
00:30:04,502 --> 00:30:06,094
Cole!
What are you doing?

254
00:30:08,606 --> 00:30:10,267
Get out of the street!

255
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:39,358
You dumb son of a bitch.

256
00:30:56,621 --> 00:30:59,647
Beckett didn't make it
to the extraction point.

257
00:31:03,294 --> 00:31:05,626
- Was he captured?
- Negative.

258
00:31:05,797 --> 00:31:08,857
Our people report
only Cole in custody.

259
00:31:11,769 --> 00:31:13,600
Is Beckett dead?

260
00:31:15,173 --> 00:31:19,542
It doesn't really matter.
Op's still on track.

261
00:31:32,790 --> 00:31:34,519
Where are the others?

262
00:31:39,597 --> 00:31:42,088
You're not alone.

263
00:31:44,035 --> 00:31:47,061
No one takes a shot like that alone.

264
00:31:53,778 --> 00:31:57,475
So who is with you?

265
00:32:04,289 --> 00:32:06,814
I don't know
what you're talking about.

266
00:32:23,675 --> 00:32:26,542
So you think...

267
00:32:26,711 --> 00:32:29,339
...being in here is...

268
00:32:29,547 --> 00:32:31,037
...funny.

269
00:32:31,215 --> 00:32:33,308
Not really.

270
00:32:33,484 --> 00:32:35,714
United Nations?

271
00:32:36,554 --> 00:32:38,522
Americans?

272
00:32:38,690 --> 00:32:40,157
British?

273
00:32:40,325 --> 00:32:42,350
Russian?

274
00:32:42,527 --> 00:32:44,893
Do I look Russian to you?

275
00:32:45,830 --> 00:32:47,024
Get him out of here.

276
00:32:56,941 --> 00:33:00,138
What are you doing?
You shouldn't have come here.

277
00:33:00,311 --> 00:33:02,779
We ran into a problem.

278
00:33:03,448 --> 00:33:05,279
Come in.

279
00:33:17,195 --> 00:33:19,390
You should have gone to the church.

280
00:33:20,698 --> 00:33:23,462
- They took your partner.
- Is he still alive?

281
00:33:23,634 --> 00:33:25,261
Yes.

282
00:33:25,436 --> 00:33:28,633
On TV, they say his capture
will prove to the world...

283
00:33:28,806 --> 00:33:32,742
...that we are the victims
of United Nations atrocities.

284
00:33:34,178 --> 00:33:36,169
Where are they holding him?

285
00:33:37,315 --> 00:33:39,579
Sponza prison.

286
00:33:41,486 --> 00:33:43,181
I've never heard of that.

287
00:33:43,354 --> 00:33:47,051
No one has,
not in your world.

288
00:33:47,358 --> 00:33:52,421
It's a secret place where Valstoria's
men imprison their special enemies.

289
00:33:53,564 --> 00:33:56,226
We have to figure a way
to get him out.

290
00:33:56,401 --> 00:33:59,063
- It's impossible.
- Nothing's impossible.

291
00:34:08,279 --> 00:34:11,043
Is there something
you're not telling me?

292
00:34:13,718 --> 00:34:15,948
Of course not.

293
00:34:18,956 --> 00:34:20,856
Let me talk to some people.

294
00:34:21,192 --> 00:34:23,456
Maybe there's a way.

295
00:34:47,552 --> 00:34:48,610
Pavel.

296
00:34:51,589 --> 00:34:54,649
He's waking up!
The American is waking up!

297
00:34:55,993 --> 00:34:57,654
Pavel!

298
00:35:05,369 --> 00:35:08,497
Leave the man alone.
Let him have some rest.

299
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:13,036
Is it true what they say?
He killed Valstoria?

300
00:35:17,615 --> 00:35:19,845
I think it is foolhardy to move him now.

301
00:35:21,352 --> 00:35:23,786
We run a great risk of taking him
into the open.

302
00:35:24,021 --> 00:35:25,545
What you think is not important.

303
00:35:26,724 --> 00:35:28,624
They have started to advance
in the North and West.

304
00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:35,563
We have no proof
they know about this place.

305
00:35:35,833 --> 00:35:37,528
We're making a huge mistake!

306
00:35:37,802 --> 00:35:41,169
The mistake was yours when
you let them kill Valstoria.

307
00:35:42,373 --> 00:35:45,809
Now we must seek the protection
of our allies to the East.

308
00:35:46,344 --> 00:35:48,073
The decision has been made...

309
00:35:49,747 --> 00:35:52,841
Don't say anything.
Just nod occasionally.

310
00:36:05,329 --> 00:36:07,194
What did you say?

311
00:36:07,365 --> 00:36:11,165
That if you got drunk again tonight
and were a bad lover...

312
00:36:11,335 --> 00:36:13,303
...I was going to leave you.

313
00:36:58,316 --> 00:37:00,614
All these arms
are from World War II.

314
00:37:00,785 --> 00:37:02,047
Some of it, yes.

315
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:04,917
What are they doing here?

316
00:37:05,089 --> 00:37:07,523
My grandfather fought the Germans.

317
00:37:07,692 --> 00:37:12,425
My father, against the Communists.
Now it's our turn.

318
00:37:24,008 --> 00:37:26,636
Mauser 792.

319
00:37:28,946 --> 00:37:32,973
It's an antique, but one of the
finest weapons the Germans made.

320
00:37:33,150 --> 00:37:35,050
Yes.

321
00:37:37,788 --> 00:37:39,813
I guess it'll do.

322
00:37:40,591 --> 00:37:42,582
Cole's in.

323
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:46,924
The hit on Valstoria's got them
running scared, as planned.

324
00:37:47,565 --> 00:37:50,762
They should move
our primary target soon.

325
00:37:51,035 --> 00:37:54,766
- How do we know Cole made contact?
- We don't.

326
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:59,539
All right. Let's finish this.

327
00:38:03,614 --> 00:38:05,582
Will this do?

328
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:08,441
- I think it'll do.
- Sophia!

329
00:38:09,387 --> 00:38:13,551
It's okay. These are my brothers,
Vojislav and Zoran.

330
00:38:13,724 --> 00:38:15,692
This is Sergeant Beckett.

331
00:38:18,162 --> 00:38:20,528
The American who crashes streetcars?

332
00:38:20,698 --> 00:38:22,757
He should not be here.
He is not part of the plan.

333
00:38:22,933 --> 00:38:24,798
His presence could jeopardize
Pavel's escape.

334
00:38:25,002 --> 00:38:26,867
Well he is here!
We have no choice now!

335
00:38:27,038 --> 00:38:29,097
Say again in English.

336
00:38:29,974 --> 00:38:33,410
There is great concern
over Valstoria's killing.

337
00:38:33,577 --> 00:38:37,980
The American prisoner and several
others will be moved to Pozarevac.

338
00:38:38,149 --> 00:38:40,515
Pozarevac is a fortress,
impenetrable.

339
00:38:40,685 --> 00:38:43,085
Once they take him,
he'll be executed.

340
00:38:43,521 --> 00:38:47,184
Okay. Get me five men,
your best shooters...

341
00:38:47,358 --> 00:38:49,223
...and I'll need a map...

342
00:38:49,393 --> 00:38:51,588
What's so funny?

343
00:38:52,730 --> 00:38:56,393
There is no one to help you
except us.

344
00:38:57,568 --> 00:38:59,536
Yes.

345
00:39:02,139 --> 00:39:05,631
You people
are the entire underground?

346
00:39:09,513 --> 00:39:11,504
We're the only ones left, no?

347
00:39:12,116 --> 00:39:13,913
Yes.

348
00:39:14,085 --> 00:39:16,110
Okay.

349
00:39:16,287 --> 00:39:18,755
Get me your best shooter.

350
00:39:22,493 --> 00:39:24,461
It's me.

351
00:39:28,532 --> 00:39:29,829
Hurrah.

352
00:39:32,069 --> 00:39:33,661
Get out! Come on, move!

353
00:39:47,151 --> 00:39:49,585
You're Pavel, right?

354
00:39:55,259 --> 00:39:57,625
When the time comes,
just do as I say.

355
00:39:57,795 --> 00:39:59,194
You two over there.

356
00:41:52,176 --> 00:41:53,370
I don't know what happened.
It just stopped...

357
00:41:53,444 --> 00:41:54,502
Get that piece of shit out of the way.

358
00:42:53,070 --> 00:42:55,163
He's in the other truck.

359
00:43:08,352 --> 00:43:10,286
C'mon already! C'mon, move!

360
00:43:24,868 --> 00:43:26,699
Weapon!

361
00:43:47,691 --> 00:43:50,023
Who the hell is he?

362
00:43:50,194 --> 00:43:52,492
That's classified.

363
00:43:53,030 --> 00:43:55,555
Classified, my ass.
Get rid of him.

364
00:43:55,733 --> 00:43:58,668
- Calm down, Beckett.
- No! We're on a mission.

365
00:43:58,836 --> 00:44:00,997
We're not here to make new friends.

366
00:44:01,171 --> 00:44:03,002
Your mission is over.

367
00:44:03,173 --> 00:44:05,471
It ended when you killed Valstoria.

368
00:44:05,643 --> 00:44:06,905
This man is mine.

369
00:44:07,077 --> 00:44:10,240
- What do you mean, yours?
- My mission:

370
00:44:10,414 --> 00:44:12,541
Get captured, find this man...

371
00:44:12,716 --> 00:44:15,150
...and bring him out of the country.

372
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:20,723
Your mission was
just a setup for mine.

373
00:44:27,798 --> 00:44:30,358
Are you all in this together?

374
00:44:38,709 --> 00:44:41,303
Don't act like this is the first time...

375
00:44:41,478 --> 00:44:44,311
...the government's ever
fucked you over.

376
00:44:45,482 --> 00:44:48,315
You made it out.
Why'd you come back?

377
00:44:48,485 --> 00:44:50,419
I had my reasons.

378
00:44:50,587 --> 00:44:53,920
Yeah, well, I wouldn't
have done the same for you.

379
00:44:54,091 --> 00:44:57,083
I guess this is a conversation
for another time.

380
00:44:57,261 --> 00:45:01,857
Whatever your reasons,
my friend, I'm grateful.

381
00:45:06,170 --> 00:45:08,934
Satellite uplink beginning in three.

382
00:45:09,973 --> 00:45:11,235
- Colonel?
- Yeah?

383
00:45:11,408 --> 00:45:14,809
This is a feed from Atlanta.
CNN's on the scene.

384
00:45:14,978 --> 00:45:16,878
Some kind of terrorist attack.

385
00:45:17,047 --> 00:45:19,208
What do we know?

386
00:45:20,884 --> 00:45:24,650
Four military vehicles,
one transport...

387
00:45:24,822 --> 00:45:27,950
...seven, maybe eight bodies.
- Ours?

388
00:45:28,125 --> 00:45:29,524
No. Soldiers.

389
00:45:29,693 --> 00:45:33,026
Scramble a chopper.
We got an evac in three hours.

390
00:45:50,547 --> 00:45:53,175
- What was this place?
- An old ironworks.

391
00:45:53,350 --> 00:45:56,217
The government brought
Muslims here to work...

392
00:45:56,386 --> 00:45:58,047
...and then killed them.

393
00:45:58,222 --> 00:46:01,419
Generals and majors,
fools and idiots.

394
00:46:01,592 --> 00:46:03,719
What is it?
What's the matter?

395
00:46:03,894 --> 00:46:05,623
- How much longer?
- 10 minutes.

396
00:46:05,796 --> 00:46:08,822
A long time in your world
of precious seconds.

397
00:46:08,999 --> 00:46:10,660
Yeah, too long.

398
00:46:10,834 --> 00:46:13,029
There's a rooftop extraction.

399
00:46:13,203 --> 00:46:14,864
- Is it safe?
- Absolutely.

400
00:46:52,709 --> 00:46:54,074
Where to now?

401
00:46:54,244 --> 00:46:56,576
The sewers will take us to the river.

402
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:06,182
They're sure interested
in getting you back.

403
00:47:06,356 --> 00:47:07,584
What did you do?

404
00:47:07,758 --> 00:47:09,988
I'm a writer.
I challenge authority.

405
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:12,924
They put me away
but they can't contain truth.

406
00:47:13,096 --> 00:47:14,290
They can kill you.

407
00:47:14,464 --> 00:47:18,400
I die, my words become more
powerful. They want me alive.

408
00:47:18,569 --> 00:47:20,366
- I'm going back up.
- Me too.

409
00:47:20,537 --> 00:47:22,266
No. You lead them out.

410
00:47:22,439 --> 00:47:25,431
That's crazy, man.
You can't help him now.

411
00:47:25,609 --> 00:47:28,635
Maybe not, but I can
slow them down for you.

412
00:47:28,812 --> 00:47:31,042
- That's suicide, man.
- I don't care.

413
00:47:31,215 --> 00:47:34,810
Dr. Pavel is my country.
If I die, don't make it in vain.

414
00:47:41,091 --> 00:47:43,651
Okay, this way.

415
00:48:01,011 --> 00:48:03,775
Though our nations are different,
you have our...

416
00:48:03,947 --> 00:48:05,642
What is it?

417
00:48:05,916 --> 00:48:08,146
Your condolences
are appreciated...

418
00:48:08,318 --> 00:48:10,286
... but your help is unnecessary...

419
00:48:10,454 --> 00:48:13,912
... unless you can name the
Americans responsible.

420
00:48:14,091 --> 00:48:15,422
What are you saying?

421
00:48:15,592 --> 00:48:18,891
They've taken something
very important from us.

422
00:48:19,062 --> 00:48:20,620
Something we want back.

423
00:48:20,797 --> 00:48:23,027
They will be placed on trial...

424
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:25,998
... and their executions
televised worldwide.

425
00:48:26,169 --> 00:48:28,262
I know American people's passions.

426
00:48:28,438 --> 00:48:33,137
What will they say when their sons
are hanging from the end of a rope?
