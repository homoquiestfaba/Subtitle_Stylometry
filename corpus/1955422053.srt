1
00:01:22,248 --> 00:01:26,116
For we meet in an hour
of change and challenge,

2
00:01:26,219 --> 00:01:29,086
in a decade of hope and fear,

3
00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:32,386
in an age of both
knowledge and ignorance.

4
00:01:32,492 --> 00:01:37,520
The greater our knowledge increases,
the greater our ignorance unfolds.

5
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:40,622
So it is not surprising

6
00:01:40,733 --> 00:01:44,567
that some would have us
stay where we are a little longer.

7
00:01:44,671 --> 00:01:47,162
To rest, to wait.

8
00:01:47,273 --> 00:01:51,141
But this city of Houston,
this state of Texas,

9
00:01:51,244 --> 00:01:53,235
this country of the United States

10
00:01:53,346 --> 00:01:57,749
was not built by those who waited and
rested and wished to look behind them.

11
00:02:02,689 --> 00:02:05,089
We choose to go to the Moon.

12
00:02:05,191 --> 00:02:07,159
We choose
to go to the Moon--

13
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:17,536
We choose to go to the Moon
in this decade and do the other things,

14
00:02:17,637 --> 00:02:21,767
not because they are easy,
but because they are hard.

15
00:02:21,875 --> 00:02:23,843
[Matt Johnson]
With this one speech,

16
00:02:23,943 --> 00:02:29,245
John F. Kennedy escalated our Cold War
with the Soviet Union to outer space.

17
00:02:29,349 --> 00:02:32,716
Now, if we do not land a man
on the Moon by 1969,

18
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:35,287
we will have broken JFK's promise.

19
00:02:35,388 --> 00:02:39,256
And in the eyes of the world,
the Soviet Union will win the Cold War.

20
00:02:39,359 --> 00:02:41,190
To make matters even more difficult,

21
00:02:41,294 --> 00:02:44,786
the CIA has discovered a leak
coming out of the space program.

22
00:02:44,898 --> 00:02:48,231
Top secret American research
is showing up in Soviet briefings,

23
00:02:48,334 --> 00:02:53,533
which means the KGB has implanted
a mole inside NASA.

24
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,767
If the Russians are able
to steal our technology,

25
00:02:55,875 --> 00:02:58,366
they could beat us to the Moon,

26
00:02:58,478 --> 00:03:02,972
just as they beat us into space
with the Sputnik satellite in 1957.

27
00:03:04,317 --> 00:03:07,445
The director of NASA, James Webb,
denies the presence of this mole,

28
00:03:07,554 --> 00:03:11,650
which means the CIA must move
in a team undercover.

29
00:03:11,758 --> 00:03:13,851
That's where we come in.

30
00:03:14,894 --> 00:03:17,624
Allow me to introduce
Owen Williams,

31
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:20,597
and myself, Matt Johnson.

32
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,827
We joined the CIA through
the Bright Recruits program

33
00:03:22,936 --> 00:03:25,837
and have been working together
ever since.

34
00:03:25,939 --> 00:03:31,309
Along with our camera team,
we make up the CIA's AV Department.

35
00:03:31,411 --> 00:03:34,403
Currently, we are finishing
Operation Deep Red:

36
00:03:34,514 --> 00:03:36,709
The probe into film director
Stanley Kubrick.

37
00:03:36,816 --> 00:03:40,684
But this mission is not using us
to our full potential.

38
00:03:40,787 --> 00:03:44,120
We are asking to be transferred off
of Operation Deep Red,

39
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:46,419
and on to Operation Zipper:

40
00:03:46,526 --> 00:03:48,790
The mission into NASA
to find the mole.

41
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:51,557
Because of our filmmaking
background, we would make...

42
00:03:51,664 --> 00:03:53,131
[Boles] Okay, stop.

43
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:54,791
- [film reel stopping]
- Stop.

44
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:56,266
What is this
supposed to be?

45
00:03:56,369 --> 00:03:59,429
Okay. It's a-- It's a pitch film.

46
00:03:59,539 --> 00:04:02,838
It-- So-- It's for Operation Zipper.
I think--

47
00:04:02,942 --> 00:04:05,240
Operation Zipper's already
been assigned.

48
00:04:05,345 --> 00:04:06,539
We know it has.

49
00:04:06,646 --> 00:04:10,673
I think the agency is making a mistake
with sending a scientist into NASA.

50
00:04:10,783 --> 00:04:12,546
Well, your opinion means nothing.

51
00:04:12,652 --> 00:04:14,677
Yeah, okay. Just-- just--
If you watch the rest of this film,

52
00:04:14,787 --> 00:04:16,311
- you'll see...
- I've seen enough.

53
00:04:16,422 --> 00:04:18,788
But we have an amazing plan
for finding the spy.

54
00:04:18,891 --> 00:04:20,415
I'm sure you do.

55
00:04:20,526 --> 00:04:23,791
Boles, we worked hard on this. You're
seriously not going to watch the rest?

56
00:04:23,896 --> 00:04:25,454
- No.
- Can we show it to Brackett?

57
00:04:25,565 --> 00:04:26,532
No.

58
00:04:29,602 --> 00:04:32,366
- [door closes]
- Okay.

59
00:04:32,472 --> 00:04:34,337
This was a long shot.

60
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:37,170
We've only been here
for one year.

61
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:39,245
We'll get on missions
like this in the future.

62
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:44,375
I thought this was
going to work.

63
00:04:44,484 --> 00:04:47,214
You knew...
You knew that it wasn't a great chance.

64
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,287
Yeah, you should--

65
00:04:48,388 --> 00:04:51,084
Jared, you should have cut
when you saw it wasn't going good.

66
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:53,181
You're supposed to be
filming so that...

67
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:55,818
[Jared]
I didn't even notice.

68
00:04:55,928 --> 00:04:57,589
- Yeah.
- Hey.

69
00:04:57,697 --> 00:04:58,755
Cut.

70
00:05:03,636 --> 00:05:04,864
Okay, I got an idea.

71
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:08,532
We need to send someone who will look
like they have no idea what's going on.

72
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:11,542
Us, as a documentary film crew.

73
00:05:11,644 --> 00:05:12,838
- We can pretend that
- Okay.

74
00:05:12,945 --> 00:05:14,776
- we are from the National Education...
- We have to go.

75
00:05:14,881 --> 00:05:15,870
We got to go.

76
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:18,314
Is this a good idea?

77
00:05:18,418 --> 00:05:20,716
- Andy?
- It's a good-- Hey. It's a good idea.

78
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:23,618
- Are you ready?
- What if they fire us?

79
00:05:23,723 --> 00:05:25,953
What's your first line?

80
00:05:26,059 --> 00:05:29,688
Oh, uh... "your plan is to send--"
Okay, I'm fine.

81
00:05:29,796 --> 00:05:32,697
- Okay. Let's go.
- [both chuckling]

82
00:05:43,109 --> 00:05:44,804
[Brackett] Everyone here?

83
00:05:44,911 --> 00:05:46,469
Boles.

84
00:05:46,579 --> 00:05:48,376
- Carry on.
- Thank you.

85
00:05:48,481 --> 00:05:50,346
Good morning, everyone.

86
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:52,418
- [reel rolling]
- [music playing]

87
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:54,782
[indistinct talking]

88
00:05:54,887 --> 00:05:57,549
Hello, my name
is Special Agent Matt Johnson,

89
00:05:57,657 --> 00:06:00,524
and what you're about to watch is a film
detailing the connections

90
00:06:00,626 --> 00:06:02,958
between Stanley Kubrick
and the film Dr. Strangelove

91
00:06:03,062 --> 00:06:05,326
or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying
and Love the Bomb.

92
00:06:05,431 --> 00:06:08,161
Conclusion:
Stanley Kubrick is not a spy.

93
00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:15,407
[sighs]

94
00:06:15,508 --> 00:06:17,806
- Thank you.
- [reel stops]

95
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:19,878
Are there any questions?

96
00:06:20,913 --> 00:06:22,107
[distant coughing]

97
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:25,778
That covers it.
Uh, what's next?

98
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:28,683
[Matt] Actually, Director Brackett,
I'd like to make a pitch

99
00:06:28,788 --> 00:06:34,420
for major research to be moved
onto Operation Zipper next.

100
00:06:34,527 --> 00:06:35,824
[Boles] What the hell
are you doing?

101
00:06:38,998 --> 00:06:40,022
You guys are trying to put

102
00:06:40,133 --> 00:06:44,570
a... field agent inside NASA
posing as a scientist,

103
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:47,764
and... Agent Williams and I
don't think it will work.

104
00:06:49,142 --> 00:06:51,736
This mole, if he's there,

105
00:06:51,844 --> 00:06:54,870
could have been at NASA
since the early '60s.

106
00:06:54,981 --> 00:06:56,778
He's going to spot one of our guys

107
00:06:56,883 --> 00:06:59,647
pretending to be
a rocket scientist instantly.

108
00:06:59,752 --> 00:07:00,878
We need to send people

109
00:07:00,987 --> 00:07:04,388
who are going to look like
they have no idea what's going on.

110
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:07,687
Us, as a documentary film crew.

111
00:07:07,794 --> 00:07:10,422
We can pretend that we're from the
National Education Television Network,

112
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:13,465
filming the definitive
Apollo documentary.

113
00:07:13,566 --> 00:07:15,363
We're there to chart the race
to the Moon.

114
00:07:15,468 --> 00:07:17,026
Smart idea.

115
00:07:17,136 --> 00:07:21,402
But no Soviet mole's gonna let anyone
openly film 'em.

116
00:07:21,507 --> 00:07:24,943
Well, Director Brackett, we're filming you
right now through the window.

117
00:07:26,512 --> 00:07:28,480
[murmuring]

118
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:36,588
You're going to have to buy us
better cameras, though.

119
00:07:38,758 --> 00:07:40,020

Let's hope they buy this.

139
00:09:01,741 --> 00:09:02,708
Ready?

140
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:05,404
Whoa!

141
00:09:07,113 --> 00:09:08,910
- Hi!
- [Sharon] Hi!

142
00:09:09,015 --> 00:09:11,449
- Just let us get our stuff.
- Yeah, yeah!

143
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:14,509
You need help, Andy?

144
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:16,144
Do you mind
if we film this?

145
00:09:16,255 --> 00:09:17,882
[Sharon chuckles]
Yeah, why not?

146
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:20,550
Here, at the end
of the hall on the right...

147
00:09:21,594 --> 00:09:22,925
Oh, man.

148
00:09:23,029 --> 00:09:24,223
That's Mission Control?

149
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:26,491
- [Sharon] Yeah, actually.
- We'll have to get in there later.

150
00:09:26,599 --> 00:09:28,089
Hmm.

151
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:31,465
Hi. We're a documentary
film crew.

152
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:32,697
We're a documentary
film crew.

153
00:09:32,805 --> 00:09:35,535
Jared, make sure you're
getting this crisp and in focus.

154
00:09:35,641 --> 00:09:39,702
I don't want to have to edit together
out of focus stuff, please. Sorry.

155
00:09:39,812 --> 00:09:42,007
[Sharon] No problem.
Your office is just right here.

156
00:09:42,114 --> 00:09:44,810
Okay, here you go.

157
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:46,077
[Matt] Wow!

158
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:48,845
[Sharon] You guys don't need
anything else?

159
00:09:48,955 --> 00:09:51,685
[Matt] No, uh, we'll come find you
if we do. We'll just get set up.

160
00:09:51,791 --> 00:09:53,918
- Thanks, Sharon.
- [Matt] Bye!

161
00:09:55,294 --> 00:09:57,626
She bought it.
We're a documentary film crew.

162
00:09:57,730 --> 00:09:59,925
You see how they look at us?
See how they look in the cameras?

163
00:10:00,032 --> 00:10:01,397
Yeah.

164
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:04,162
[chuckles] This is the best mission
I've ever been on in my life.

165
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:05,931
[Sharon] This is, uh...
This is Matt.

166
00:10:06,038 --> 00:10:08,029
- Mike.
- Nice to meet you.

167
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:10,131
[Sharon]
And, uh, this is Jared.

168
00:10:10,242 --> 00:10:14,269
They're filming a documentary
about the, uh... the Apollo mission.

169
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:16,280
Oh, okay!

170
00:10:16,382 --> 00:10:17,849
So, we basically-- we just are asking

171
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:19,815
- about what you do, and...
- Sure!

172
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:21,944
- And-- and I'm ready.
- Yeah. Okay.

And he's got his hand and he's rolling
them on the plate like that.

And I stood up in the theater
in Sugar Land and I said,

through a semi-transparent mirror

and then onto a gigantic silver screen.

Then he films the entire scene
through the same mirror

1014
00:57:31,548 --> 00:57:33,072
Jared, get in the car!

1015
00:57:34,751 --> 00:57:35,945
[car doors slamming]

1016
00:57:42,892 --> 00:57:44,553
Boles, what are you doing?

1017
00:57:44,661 --> 00:57:46,856
[tires screeching]

1018
00:57:46,963 --> 00:57:50,262
- What happened?
- You shot your fucking gun!

1019
00:57:51,468 --> 00:57:54,198
Jared, shoot out the front!
Try to get their license plate!

1020
00:57:55,839 --> 00:57:58,865
- [engine backfires]
- Come on!

1021
00:57:58,975 --> 00:58:00,909
- No!
- [Jared] What?

1022
00:58:01,010 --> 00:58:02,807
[engine stalling]

1023
00:58:02,912 --> 00:58:03,879
[crash]

1024
00:58:08,952 --> 00:58:10,544
[Owen] What happened?

1025
00:58:10,653 --> 00:58:12,086
[Boles] What happened to your car?

1026
00:58:12,188 --> 00:58:14,656
It stalled.
They got away.

1027
00:58:14,757 --> 00:58:16,384
[Boles] Well, did you get a look at them?

1028
00:58:18,228 --> 00:58:20,128
Whoever it is,
they know we're here.

1029
00:58:20,230 --> 00:58:21,390
Well, we don't know who it is.

1030
00:58:21,498 --> 00:58:23,125
I think it's the mole.

1031
00:58:23,233 --> 00:58:25,701
I think it's the mole that you guys
sent us here to find in the first place.

1032
00:58:25,802 --> 00:58:27,201
Who else is waiting outside the studio

1033
00:58:27,303 --> 00:58:28,930
- and then the minute we walk out...
- Let's lock it up.

1034
00:58:29,038 --> 00:58:30,596
Let's lock it up and call Brackett.

1035
00:58:30,707 --> 00:58:33,608
What-- Lock it up? We're in the middle
of this! We can't just stop shooting!

1036
00:58:33,710 --> 00:58:35,575
Well, there might be
guys on the roof.

1037
00:58:35,678 --> 00:58:37,908
What do you mean, guys on the roof?
What the fuck is going on?

1038
00:58:38,014 --> 00:58:39,106
And what, you got a gun?

1039
00:58:39,282 --> 00:58:41,773
[man on TV]
This is CBS News special report.

1040
00:58:41,885 --> 00:58:43,546
The Flight of Apollo 8.

1041
00:58:43,653 --> 00:58:45,120
Six days
to the Moon and back.

1042
00:58:45,221 --> 00:58:47,519
Brought to you
by Walter Cronkite.

1043
00:58:47,624 --> 00:58:50,525
The flight of Apollo 8 is over.

1044
00:58:50,627 --> 00:58:54,063
And all that remains is to remove
the astronauts from the space craft,

1045
00:58:54,163 --> 00:58:59,430
and carry them less than two miles
to the deck of the carrier Yorktown.

1046
00:58:59,536 --> 00:59:02,061
Future plans for space missions,
of course,

1047
00:59:02,171 --> 00:59:04,765
have been accelerated considerably.

1048
00:59:04,874 --> 00:59:08,105
It means that they can keep
to the hoped-for schedule

1049
00:59:08,211 --> 00:59:14,673
of the next Apollo 9 mission,
late in February or early in March,

1050
00:59:14,784 --> 00:59:17,150
to test out the landing module,

1051
00:59:17,253 --> 00:59:20,745
and, uh, then move on towards
landing a man on the Moon

1052
00:59:20,857 --> 00:59:23,985
two flights further on
in the middle of July.

1053
00:59:25,795 --> 00:59:29,663
[Boles] So we've got
good news and bad news.

1054
00:59:29,766 --> 00:59:34,203
The good news: his name
is Antonin Lhotsky.

1055
00:59:34,304 --> 00:59:36,864
- [Matt] Uh-huh.
- [Boles] He's a KGB agent.

1056
00:59:36,973 --> 00:59:38,838
He's the man from outside the studio
the other night.

1057
00:59:38,942 --> 00:59:39,966
Whoa, what?

1058
00:59:40,076 --> 00:59:42,977
We suspect he's been the mole
the entire time.

1059
00:59:43,079 --> 00:59:45,877
S-- so then he knows
about Avalanche. We're fucked!

1060
00:59:45,982 --> 00:59:47,108
We don't think he does.

1061
00:59:47,216 --> 00:59:49,582
We've been interrogating him
for the past couple of days.

1062
00:59:49,686 --> 00:59:53,213
He doesn't seem to know anything.
We've raided his house. Nothing.

1063
00:59:53,323 --> 00:59:55,883
[Owen] This guy's the mole?
And you-- you got him?

1064
00:59:55,992 --> 00:59:56,959
We got him.

1065
00:59:58,361 --> 01:00:04,163
So, then... what?
We're just... We're good?

1066
01:00:04,267 --> 01:00:06,030
Well, not entirely.

1067
01:00:06,135 --> 01:00:09,935
We, uh, got some new Intel
on the Soviet progress,

1068
01:00:10,039 --> 01:00:13,099
and it turns out they're doing better
than we thought.

1069
01:00:13,209 --> 01:00:18,203
It looks like they could possibly make it
to the Moon by the end of '69.

1070
01:00:18,314 --> 01:00:23,946
Which means that we need to be done
by April, at the latest.

1071
01:00:24,053 --> 01:00:27,045
Yeah, that puts us
on a pretty tight timeline.

1072
01:00:27,156 --> 01:00:29,386
[Matt on tape] They know we're here.
We're allowed to be here, okay?

1073
01:00:29,492 --> 01:00:30,459
Relax.

1074
01:00:30,560 --> 01:00:31,618
Hi.

1075
01:00:32,662 --> 01:00:33,629
[car engine starts]

1077
01:00:38,067 --> 01:00:39,694
[Matt] Go, go, go, go!

1078
01:00:42,071 --> 01:00:43,629
Jared, get in the car!

1079
01:00:46,309 --> 01:00:47,435
[clicking]

1080
01:01:10,867 --> 01:01:12,926
- [Matt on phone] Hello?
- Matt, we have a problem here.

1081
01:01:13,036 --> 01:01:14,162
[clicking]

1082
01:01:15,738 --> 01:01:20,004
[Lhostky]...gentleman got the contract
with, I don't know, somebody.

1083
01:01:20,109 --> 01:01:22,339
This is who they say
the mole was.

1084
01:01:22,445 --> 01:01:24,913
So we interviewed him?

1085
01:01:25,014 --> 01:01:28,347
Yeah, over a year ago.

1086
01:01:28,451 --> 01:01:30,146
Remember when you asked me
to find out

1087
01:01:30,253 --> 01:01:32,813
- who was on the phone with Webb?
- Of course.

1088
01:01:32,922 --> 01:01:34,890
- I did.
- [clicking]

1089
01:01:34,991 --> 01:01:36,925
[Lhostky]
...second burn to the lunar surface.

1090
01:01:37,026 --> 01:01:39,187
Then we can go in after that for 250.

1091
01:01:39,295 --> 01:01:41,661
[Webb]
250 seconds is all we can do?

1092
01:01:41,764 --> 01:01:43,994
[Lhotsky]
That's the maximum, and you know that...

1093
01:01:44,100 --> 01:01:45,590
[Webb]
Did you talk to TRW?

1094
01:01:45,702 --> 01:01:49,194
[Lhotsky] Yeah. And you know how they
are about their fuels.

1095
01:01:49,305 --> 01:01:50,932
- So we are in trouble...
- Grumman...

1096
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:52,405
[recording stops]

1097
01:01:52,508 --> 01:01:53,839
What does this mean?

1098
01:01:56,245 --> 01:02:01,740
So the mole knew that we couldn't make it
to the Moon for over a year?

1099
01:02:03,853 --> 01:02:06,048
I don't think so.

1100
01:02:06,155 --> 01:02:08,123
I don't think
that Lhotsky's the mole.

1101
01:02:08,224 --> 01:02:11,819
I don't think Lhotsky
was outside the studio.

1102
01:02:11,928 --> 01:02:14,761
I mean, Lhotsky knows that we can't make
it to the Moon, so maybe they--

1103
01:02:14,864 --> 01:02:17,731
He wouldn't cooperate and they had
to make him a fall guy

1104
01:02:17,834 --> 01:02:19,768
- by saying that he's the mole.
- They?

1105
01:02:21,170 --> 01:02:22,330
Yeah.

1106
01:02:22,438 --> 01:02:25,271
- What do-- what do you mean?
- The CIA.

1107
01:02:25,374 --> 01:02:29,140
Okay, well, then who's outside
the studio following us?

1108
01:02:29,245 --> 01:02:31,076
CIA agents.

1109
01:02:31,180 --> 01:02:34,047
That's why Boles
didn't shoot them.

1110
01:02:34,150 --> 01:02:35,708
They're all
working together.

1111
01:02:35,818 --> 01:02:38,184
They're all watching us,
and they're lying to us.

1112
01:02:38,287 --> 01:02:39,754
For what?
For what purpose?

1113
01:02:39,856 --> 01:02:43,292
They know everything that we're doing.
Why... This doesn't make any sense.

1114
01:02:43,392 --> 01:02:46,225
There's no reason
for them to be following us.

1115
01:02:46,329 --> 01:02:47,956
You-- Have you--

1116
01:02:48,064 --> 01:02:50,931
Have you heard
of a conspiracy theory before?

1117
01:02:51,033 --> 01:02:54,264
Yeah.
I think we're in one.

1118
01:03:55,731 --> 01:03:57,460
[Matt] Okay, leg out!

1119
01:03:57,567 --> 01:03:58,829
[camera clicking]

1120
01:03:58,935 --> 01:04:00,061
[Jared] That
doesn't look real.

1121
01:04:00,169 --> 01:04:01,431
Okay, you know what we'll do?

1122
01:04:01,537 --> 01:04:04,131
Jump on the count of three.
Ready?

1123
01:04:04,240 --> 01:04:05,366
I'm bringing the bounce in.

1124
01:04:05,474 --> 01:04:06,873
[Owen] That's a big jump.

1125
01:04:06,976 --> 01:04:10,070
Come on, you're supposed to be
Neil Armstrong. He's brave. Ready?

1126
01:04:10,179 --> 01:04:11,771
- [latch clicking]
- There we go.

1127
01:04:14,884 --> 01:04:15,976
Uh, change the background.

1128
01:04:20,590 --> 01:04:21,682
One more.

1129
01:04:24,427 --> 01:04:25,394
How about that?

1130
01:04:25,494 --> 01:04:27,291
- [camera clicking]
- Great.

1131
01:04:27,396 --> 01:04:28,920
That's great.

1132
01:04:29,031 --> 01:04:32,398
What are we getting in the reflection
of his helmet? Am I in it?

1133
01:04:32,501 --> 01:04:33,991
[Jared] We'll have
to replace that after.

1134
01:04:46,215 --> 01:04:48,080
- [Matt] That looks great.
- [Jared] And then you just...

1135
01:04:48,184 --> 01:04:49,151
We have to repress this.

1136
01:04:49,252 --> 01:04:51,186
Put that on an animation stand
and reshoot it.

1137
01:04:51,287 --> 01:04:53,915
This is the original
from the sound stage.

1138
01:04:54,023 --> 01:04:55,957
And the crater textures
are added after.

1139
01:04:56,058 --> 01:04:58,253
Getting rid of the details
in the studio.

1140
01:04:58,361 --> 01:05:00,989
You go in and you black out the areas
with litho ink.

1141
01:05:01,097 --> 01:05:06,296
Let's move this a little bit further down,
because it seems a little too square.

1142
01:05:06,402 --> 01:05:07,892
- Square to camera?
- Yeah.

1143
01:05:08,004 --> 01:05:09,130
Sure.

1144
01:05:13,876 --> 01:05:15,309
Wow.

1145
01:05:15,411 --> 01:05:16,844
[no audio]

1146
01:05:28,391 --> 01:05:31,554
- Ready?
- [chuckling] That's good. Yeah, go.

1147
01:05:31,661 --> 01:05:32,992
[Matt laughing]

1148
01:05:33,095 --> 01:05:35,655
- It works.
- Yes!

1149
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:38,589
This is amazing!
Go again.

1150
01:05:38,701 --> 01:05:41,226
- [Owen] Matt.
- Yes?

1151
01:05:41,337 --> 01:05:42,827
- Have you seen this?
- Have you seen this?

1152
01:05:42,939 --> 01:05:45,908
Do it again! Do it again!
Owen, look, look.

1153
01:05:46,008 --> 01:05:47,873
Hammer, feather.

1154
01:05:47,977 --> 01:05:49,945
Drop!
Galileo was right.

1155
01:05:50,046 --> 01:05:53,277
Dude, I just put
a weight in it. What?

1156
01:05:53,382 --> 01:05:57,443
"NASA Scientist Dies."
It's from this morning's paper.

1157
01:06:00,056 --> 01:06:02,957
- Well, what the--
- Matt, it's Lhotsky.

1158
01:06:03,059 --> 01:06:04,185
What?

1159
01:06:04,293 --> 01:06:07,592
Boles.
He must've known about it.

1160
01:06:07,697 --> 01:06:09,392
Listen, think
why Lhotsky's dead.

1161
01:06:09,498 --> 01:06:11,966
Obviously, he was talking to Webb,
so they killed him.

1162
01:06:12,068 --> 01:06:13,262
They're going to kill me--

1163
01:06:13,369 --> 01:06:15,303
- We don't know why that guy's dead.
- Yes, we do.

1164
01:06:15,404 --> 01:06:17,167
"They're going to kill me"?
What are you talking about?

1165
01:06:17,273 --> 01:06:19,332
They're going to kill us both,
they're going to kill the astronauts.

1166
01:06:19,442 --> 01:06:21,342
- I'm sure--
- Anyone who knows about this.

1167
01:06:21,444 --> 01:06:23,912
I'm sure Lhotsky knew too much and so
they got rid of him. Okay? That's it.

1168
01:06:24,013 --> 01:06:26,345
Right! Right!
That's what I'm talking about!

1169
01:06:26,449 --> 01:06:28,679
He was the mole, okay?

1170
01:06:28,784 --> 01:06:32,015
No, no, they're tying off loose ends!

1171
01:06:32,121 --> 01:06:34,021
Yeah, and so who else is
gonna die, huh?

1172
01:06:34,123 --> 01:06:36,648
They're gonna kill Jim Webb?
The head of NASA? He knows, too!

1173
01:06:36,759 --> 01:06:39,227
Maybe. Maybe.
You don't think they would?

1174
01:06:39,328 --> 01:06:41,956
[laughs] No! Okay, put the suit on
and get ready, all right?

1175
01:06:42,064 --> 01:06:43,622
Shut the fuck up.

1176
