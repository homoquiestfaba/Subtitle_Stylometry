1
00:00:57,154 --> 00:00:58,422
Holy..

2
00:00:58,489 --> 00:00:59,790
You can't go up there.

3
00:00:59,857 --> 00:01:01,926
I'm going with or without you!

4
00:01:02,994 --> 00:01:04,028
Go!

5
00:01:08,499 --> 00:01:10,501
Cover!
Come on, come on!

6
00:01:14,005 --> 00:01:16,207
Go, go, go..

7
00:01:30,655 --> 00:01:33,424
This is a typical day
for the men and women

8
00:01:33,491 --> 00:01:34,825
of the Belize Special Forces.

9
00:01:34,892 --> 00:01:37,461
Didn't know Belize had a
Special Force?

10
00:01:37,528 --> 00:01:39,697
Think again.
They do.

11
00:01:39,764 --> 00:01:41,899
And today, after nearly two years

12
00:01:41,966 --> 00:01:44,635
of quiet preparation with
the best of both British

13
00:01:44,702 --> 00:01:46,971
and American Military Advisors,

14
00:01:47,038 --> 00:01:49,840
we are privileged enough
to be here at Price Barracks

15
00:01:49,907 --> 00:01:50,875
for the unveiling of

16
00:01:50,942 --> 00:01:53,477
and participation in a new mission.

17
00:01:55,246 --> 00:01:56,814
As you were, Staff.

18
00:01:56,881 --> 00:01:57,848
Sir.

19
00:01:57,915 --> 00:01:59,116
All right, Guys.

20
00:01:59,183 --> 00:02:00,818
Thank you all very much for
coming on such short notice.

21
00:02:03,421 --> 00:02:05,089
We have reason to believe

22
00:02:05,156 --> 00:02:06,757
that there will be illegal activity

23
00:02:06,824 --> 00:02:08,993
along the line of the border.

24
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:11,596
And what we want your patrol
to do is to go

25
00:02:11,662 --> 00:02:16,100
and place six remote cameras
in the border area

26
00:02:16,167 --> 00:02:18,169
and return safely to us.

27
00:02:18,235 --> 00:02:20,237
You'll have three civilians
with you.

28
00:02:20,304 --> 00:02:22,240
One is Ms. Julia Evans.

29
00:02:22,306 --> 00:02:24,075
Some of you may have read her book.

30
00:02:24,141 --> 00:02:26,444
Yeah, and Mark.

31
00:02:27,678 --> 00:02:30,881
We'll take it by truck from here

32
00:02:30,948 --> 00:02:34,085
through the Caracol
Archaeological Reserve

33
00:02:34,151 --> 00:02:36,821
and drop off by Puchetuck Camp.

34
00:02:36,887 --> 00:02:38,723
From there,
you will proceed on foot.

35
00:02:38,789 --> 00:02:42,827
At your discretion,
you lay the six remote cameras

36
00:02:42,893 --> 00:02:44,528
in a line

37
00:02:44,595 --> 00:02:47,898
three kilometers either side
of the Chiquibul River.

38
00:02:47,965 --> 00:02:50,601
That should take you about
two or three days,

39
00:02:50,668 --> 00:02:53,437
and then make your way back
to Millionaro Camp

40
00:02:53,504 --> 00:02:56,340
and give us a call,
and we'll come get you.

41
00:02:56,407 --> 00:02:59,010
Are there any question?

42
00:02:59,076 --> 00:03:00,278
Sir, Bechenze.

43
00:03:00,344 --> 00:03:01,278
Yes, Staff.

44
00:03:01,345 --> 00:03:03,314
Will we have unmanned drones?

45
00:03:03,381 --> 00:03:05,416
There's no drone coverage
for your patrol,

46
00:03:05,483 --> 00:03:07,652
so basically you're on your own.

47
00:03:13,658 --> 00:03:15,960
Oh, I'm actually going
in the truck over there.

48
00:03:16,027 --> 00:03:18,429
No. No.
You're riding with us, okay?

49
00:03:18,496 --> 00:03:20,264
Oh. Yeah.
Yeah, that sounds good.

50
00:03:20,331 --> 00:03:21,465
Okay?
Sure.

51
00:03:21,532 --> 00:03:23,734
Looks like we're going in
this truck.

52
00:03:23,801 --> 00:03:25,403
So what do you guys like to
do for fun

53
00:03:25,469 --> 00:03:28,205
When you're not on missions?

54
00:03:28,272 --> 00:03:29,373
Drinking.

55
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,641
Drinking?

56
00:03:30,708 --> 00:03:32,977
Drinking with my ladies

57
00:03:33,044 --> 00:03:35,446
and have a good time.

58
00:03:53,497 --> 00:03:54,432
Can I try?

59
00:03:54,498 --> 00:03:55,966
Yeah, sure.

60
00:03:56,033 --> 00:03:57,101
Will you hold this for me?

61
00:03:57,168 --> 00:03:58,736
Okay.

62
00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:20,825
Get in.

63
00:04:56,394 --> 00:04:57,661
Okay, listen.

64
00:04:57,728 --> 00:05:00,397
You follow in that truck, okay?

65
00:05:00,464 --> 00:05:02,500
Other march, remain the same,
no change.

66
00:05:02,566 --> 00:05:03,534
Everybody understood?

67
00:05:03,601 --> 00:05:04,802
Okay. Let's move.

68
00:07:33,017 --> 00:07:35,753
(Foreign language)

69
00:07:38,422 --> 00:07:39,757
What did he say?

70
00:07:39,823 --> 00:07:41,659
He said that the ocean's
a hundred miles away.

71
00:07:41,725 --> 00:07:43,827
No clue how the boat got here.

72
00:09:34,505 --> 00:09:36,340
(Whispering)

73
00:09:36,407 --> 00:09:38,475
It looks like we found
some kind of boat,

74
00:09:38,542 --> 00:09:40,210
which is really random.

75
00:09:40,277 --> 00:09:42,446
Boat in the middle of the
jungle, huh?

76
00:09:42,513 --> 00:09:43,680
Yeah.

77
00:09:43,747 --> 00:09:46,483
And then hold it back, too.

78
00:10:18,015 --> 00:10:19,349
How far away from the ocean?

79
00:10:19,416 --> 00:10:22,386
It's approximately 150 miles.

80
00:10:22,453 --> 00:10:25,589
Really?
Really.

81
00:10:25,656 --> 00:10:27,991
150 miles?

82
00:10:28,058 --> 00:10:29,893
How did this get here?

83
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,962
We don't know.

84
00:10:36,767 --> 00:10:38,135
Is that what you found on the boat?

85
00:10:38,202 --> 00:10:40,771
Yeah.
It's a camera.

86
00:10:45,242 --> 00:10:47,244
Card's probably still good.

87
00:10:48,378 --> 00:10:50,114
You sure it still works?

88
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:52,616
No, but it body looks good.

89
00:10:52,683 --> 00:10:53,817
I think so.

90
00:10:53,884 --> 00:10:54,818
Can we see what's on it?

91
00:10:54,885 --> 00:10:56,353
We'll see.

92
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:57,788
We don't have a reader
for this size card.

93
00:10:57,855 --> 00:11:01,258
We have to do it back at the base.

94
00:12:15,666 --> 00:12:16,934
Here we go.

95
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,802
Want me to sign it to you?

96
00:12:18,869 --> 00:12:19,803
Yeah.

97
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:20,871
What's your name?

98
00:12:20,938 --> 00:12:22,573
Andrew.

99
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:29,346
Here's to a lovely week

100
00:12:29,413 --> 00:12:33,317
with you

101
00:12:33,383 --> 00:12:37,221
in the jungle.

102
00:12:41,758 --> 00:12:44,795
And what is this you're
putting on right now?

103
00:12:44,861 --> 00:12:47,631
It's a laser gun.

104
00:12:47,698 --> 00:12:48,999
No, it's not.

105
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:54,204
Yeah. No, they're infrareds.

106
00:12:54,271 --> 00:12:55,639
Night vision infrared.

107
00:13:10,254 --> 00:13:11,888
We're neighbors.

108
00:13:11,955 --> 00:13:13,357
That would appear to be true.

109
00:13:13,423 --> 00:13:16,026
You're gonna fall out of your thing

110
00:13:16,093 --> 00:13:17,761
in the middle of the night,
wake me up?

111
00:13:17,828 --> 00:13:19,429
Nah.

112
00:13:22,566 --> 00:13:26,069
I think your head is
supposed to go on that end.

113
00:13:51,762 --> 00:13:53,030
There we go.

114
00:13:57,934 --> 00:13:59,303
Good.

115
00:13:59,369 --> 00:14:00,637
Good.

116
00:14:00,704 --> 00:14:02,205
What are you guys
setting these cameras for?

117
00:14:02,272 --> 00:14:04,574
We're setting these
cameras to detect

118
00:14:04,641 --> 00:14:07,644
any illegal intruders here we call

119
00:14:07,711 --> 00:14:08,645
the Xateros.

120
00:14:08,712 --> 00:14:10,113
People from Guatemala

121
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:11,748
doing illegal stuff here in Belize.

122
00:14:11,815 --> 00:14:13,850
Like logging, farming.

123
00:14:13,917 --> 00:14:18,288
Also, we will set up these
cameras around our camps.

124
00:14:18,355 --> 00:14:21,458
And also, the camera will
detect any unusual movement.

125
00:14:37,207 --> 00:14:38,608
What is it?

126
00:14:38,675 --> 00:14:40,777
Howler Monkey.

127
00:14:58,929 --> 00:15:00,564
Croc.

128
00:15:50,947 --> 00:15:52,816
(Whispering)

129
00:15:56,653 --> 00:15:57,921
Hey, Pete.

130
00:15:57,988 --> 00:15:58,955
Pete.

131
00:15:59,022 --> 00:16:00,857
Go and get London for me.

132
00:16:56,913 --> 00:16:58,415
What's going on?

133
00:17:08,692 --> 00:17:10,227
What is that?

134
00:17:13,497 --> 00:17:15,899
It wasn't there last night.

135
00:17:15,966 --> 00:17:17,100
What?

136
00:17:17,167 --> 00:17:18,101
It wasn't there last night.

137
00:17:18,168 --> 00:17:19,703
No, I don't think so.

138
00:17:22,105 --> 00:17:25,208
That's weird.

139
00:17:27,978 --> 00:17:29,679
We have one more over there.

140
00:17:38,121 --> 00:17:39,823
What does that mean?

141
00:17:39,890 --> 00:17:42,626
I don't know.

142
00:17:42,692 --> 00:17:44,761
Have you guys seen
anything like that before?

143
00:17:50,567 --> 00:17:51,568
Didn't hear anything?

144
00:17:51,635 --> 00:17:53,069
No, I didn't hear anything.

145
00:17:53,136 --> 00:17:54,304
Phil.

146
00:17:55,172 --> 00:17:57,774
Phil.
Go look at this.

147
00:18:10,921 --> 00:18:12,689
Find the camera.

148
00:18:12,756 --> 00:18:14,257
Find the camera.

149
00:18:19,229 --> 00:18:21,398
Comb the area.

150
00:18:36,846 --> 00:18:38,782
Get them talking over there.

151
00:19:38,775 --> 00:19:40,744
(Whispering)

152
00:19:44,948 --> 00:19:46,549
Zero One, Zero Alpha.

153
00:19:46,616 --> 00:19:47,984
Send, send, over.

154
00:19:52,055 --> 00:19:53,223
Send, over.

155
00:19:53,289 --> 00:19:58,695
We'll give you a grid, over.

156
00:20:20,984 --> 00:20:22,485
Get down.

157
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:32,462
One, Zero Alpha.

158
00:20:32,529 --> 00:20:33,897
Roger my location.

159
00:20:33,963 --> 00:20:40,103
I read: Bravo, Papa, Alpha, Bravo,

160
00:20:40,170 --> 00:20:44,507
Charlie, Delta, Echo, Romeo.

161
00:20:44,574 --> 00:20:46,810
Roger. Out.

162
00:21:13,069 --> 00:21:15,472
All right, Guys.
Everybody can hear me?

163
00:21:15,538 --> 00:21:18,942
All right.
Mission change.

164
00:21:19,008 --> 00:21:22,879
I have just get a radio message
from high command.

165
00:21:22,946 --> 00:21:26,149
They have two archeological
people went missing.

166
00:21:26,216 --> 00:21:28,351
Presently, we are at..

167
00:21:28,418 --> 00:21:30,553
Presently right now,
we are at Numeria Area.

168
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:34,724
We have approximately
12 clicks to go

169
00:21:34,791 --> 00:21:36,960
to where these people went missing.

170
00:21:37,026 --> 00:21:37,594
Everybody now stand up.

171
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:39,229
Okay, up it is.

172
00:21:39,295 --> 00:21:41,197
Move up.

173
00:22:30,547 --> 00:22:34,050
Oi. Oi!

174
00:22:34,117 --> 00:22:36,252
(Spanish)

175
00:24:31,734 --> 00:24:33,536
Anything unusual in front?

176
00:24:33,603 --> 00:24:35,071
Anything unusual?

177
00:24:35,138 --> 00:24:36,339
No.

178
00:24:36,406 --> 00:24:38,274
I just.. I heard a noise,

179
00:24:38,341 --> 00:24:40,610
Then everything went quiet
just over that ridge over there.

180
00:24:42,512 --> 00:24:44,013
(Whispering)

181
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:45,615
Okay.

182
00:24:48,117 --> 00:24:49,352
Okay.

183
00:24:49,419 --> 00:24:51,721
Take a tick or five.

184
00:24:52,755 --> 00:24:54,023
Looks good?
You're good.

185
00:24:54,090 --> 00:24:55,625
Something doesn't feel right.

186
00:24:55,692 --> 00:24:57,860
You don't feel right?

187
00:24:57,927 --> 00:24:59,562
Something doesn't..

188
00:24:59,629 --> 00:25:00,897
What about it?

189
00:25:00,964 --> 00:25:03,366
It feels like something's
been following us

190
00:25:03,433 --> 00:25:06,069
along this side

191
00:25:06,135 --> 00:25:07,937
and then, like I said,
it went quiet.

192
00:25:08,004 --> 00:25:10,006
This just doesn't feel right.

193
00:25:10,073 --> 00:25:11,407
Okay.

194
00:25:11,474 --> 00:25:15,178
What I want you to do,
I want you to stay focused, okay?

195
00:25:15,244 --> 00:25:19,449
You look directly,
especially directly in front.

196
00:25:19,515 --> 00:25:21,351
Anything unusual,

197
00:25:21,417 --> 00:25:23,286
you halt the patrol.
Do you understand?

198
00:25:23,353 --> 00:25:24,354
I understand.

199
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:25,755
Okay.

200
00:25:25,822 --> 00:25:27,323
I move back.

201
00:25:27,390 --> 00:25:30,460
As soon as I reach back,
that indicate to you to move.

202
00:25:30,526 --> 00:25:31,794
Don't move too fast.

203
00:25:31,861 --> 00:25:33,529
Move just not too fast,
not too slow,

204
00:25:33,596 --> 00:25:35,765
but stay focused, okay?

205
00:25:35,832 --> 00:25:36,899
Yes, Sir.
Okay.

206
00:25:36,966 --> 00:25:38,201
A soon as I reach back, you move.

207
00:25:38,267 --> 00:25:39,402
Yes, Sir.

208
00:25:45,274 --> 00:25:46,576
You keep down.

209
00:25:46,642 --> 00:25:47,677
You keep down.

210
00:25:47,744 --> 00:25:49,178
Keep down.

211
00:27:52,401 --> 00:27:54,437
As we go..

212
00:27:54,504 --> 00:27:57,874
You take a left, okay?
You focus on your left.

213
00:27:57,940 --> 00:27:59,275
Are we good?

214
00:27:59,342 --> 00:28:00,276
Yeah.

215
00:28:08,017 --> 00:28:09,051
Hands above your head!

216
00:28:09,118 --> 00:28:10,553
Turn around, step out!

217
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:13,890
Faster! Move, move, move,
move, move, move, move!

218
00:28:13,956 --> 00:28:16,659
Hands down.

219
00:28:16,726 --> 00:28:20,196
(Mayan)

220
00:29:19,856 --> 00:29:21,257
Phil.

221
00:29:22,225 --> 00:29:24,627
Thompson. Sir?

222
00:29:54,123 --> 00:29:56,692
Guys, come have a look.

223
00:30:04,267 --> 00:30:05,568
What the fuck is that?

224
00:30:05,635 --> 00:30:06,836
I don't know.
You think it's a fake?

225
00:30:06,902 --> 00:30:08,638
I don't know.

226
00:30:29,525 --> 00:30:32,094
Now, the good thing is
it doesn't look as though

227
00:30:32,161 --> 00:30:33,729
anyone's been here
for a number of years.

228
00:30:33,796 --> 00:30:35,131
And if there is artifacts here,

229
00:30:35,197 --> 00:30:37,233
it's good that we get to them first.

230
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:41,671
The Mayans, they used to invade
the caves, destroy the artifact.

231
00:30:41,737 --> 00:30:43,472
They used to think it was
a way to the Underworld.

232
00:30:43,539 --> 00:30:47,376
Only the hierarchy were
allowed to actually come in.

233
00:30:49,178 --> 00:30:52,181
So it's people like High
Priests and Shaman.

234
00:30:52,248 --> 00:30:57,086
They used to conduct
human sacrifices, rituals,

235
00:30:57,153 --> 00:30:59,322
do quite terrible things to
be honest.

236
00:30:59,388 --> 00:31:00,589
And if they came across artifacts

237
00:31:00,656 --> 00:31:01,958
from previous generations,
what they'd do

238
00:31:02,024 --> 00:31:03,326
is normally destroy them.

239
00:31:03,392 --> 00:31:07,630
They thought that was
a way of banishing the evil.

240
00:31:11,934 --> 00:31:13,202
But it is looking good.

241
00:31:13,269 --> 00:31:14,770
I don't think anybody
has been here so far.

242
00:31:20,009 --> 00:31:22,678
Looks to be a passage
to another cave here.

243
00:31:34,623 --> 00:31:36,759
Just watch it,
it's fairly tight here.

244
00:31:47,069 --> 00:31:48,904
Yeah. It looks like there's
another cave,

245
00:31:48,971 --> 00:31:50,106
a big one out there.

246
00:31:51,607 --> 00:31:53,743
You still okay?

247
00:31:55,544 --> 00:31:56,512
Oh, yeah.

248
00:32:00,182 --> 00:32:01,650
Okay, let's grab a look at this.

249
00:33:20,796 --> 00:33:23,632
Susan.

250
00:33:23,699 --> 00:33:26,202
I think,

251
00:33:26,268 --> 00:33:30,873
I think we have something here.

252
00:33:32,608 --> 00:33:34,276
Wow.

253
00:33:38,314 --> 00:33:40,716
Well, you can guarantee
there hasn't been anyone

254
00:33:40,783 --> 00:33:42,885
in this cave for many
thousands of years.

255
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:46,155
Something been broken.

256
00:33:46,222 --> 00:33:48,724
That's what the Mayans used
to do.

257
00:33:48,791 --> 00:33:53,629
They used to break them to
banish the evils of the previous.

258
00:33:54,997 --> 00:33:56,832
There's a fireplace.

259
00:34:00,469 --> 00:34:02,605
I feel like there's some more
down there as well.

260
00:34:13,215 --> 00:34:15,718
What the..?

261
00:34:15,784 --> 00:34:18,120
Susan, come here.

262
00:34:18,187 --> 00:34:20,890
What the hell is that?

263
00:34:27,096 --> 00:34:28,564
My god.

264
00:34:28,631 --> 00:34:30,299
Susan.

265
00:34:37,873 --> 00:34:39,942
What is that?

266
00:37:15,064 --> 00:37:17,666
Okay.

267
00:37:17,733 --> 00:37:19,835
What initially began as
a basic routine mission

268
00:37:19,902 --> 00:37:21,570
to establish cameras in the jungle

269
00:37:21,637 --> 00:37:22,805
to be aware of Xateros

270
00:37:22,871 --> 00:37:25,007
has now become one of grave danger.

271
00:37:25,074 --> 00:37:28,477
Two missing archaeologists
are still unlocated.

272
00:37:28,544 --> 00:37:30,512
We have trekked through
miles of jungle

273
00:37:30,579 --> 00:37:32,715
to come to what we believe
was their camp

274
00:37:32,781 --> 00:37:35,017
where we have found food,
cameras and other supplies,

275
00:37:35,084 --> 00:37:37,519
but no signs of the missing British

276
00:37:37,586 --> 00:37:39,021
and American individuals.

277
00:37:39,088 --> 00:37:41,657
We will continue looking
throughout this afternoon

278
00:37:41,724 --> 00:37:44,526
and potentially this evening
in hopes of finding

279
00:37:44,593 --> 00:37:46,729
these two people before grave danger

280
00:37:46,795 --> 00:37:48,397
such as dehydration sets in.

281
00:37:48,464 --> 00:37:51,867
In the meantime, I'll give you
a brief rundown of Xunantunich,

282
00:37:51,934 --> 00:37:54,169
the Mayan Ruins where we
currently stand.

283
00:37:54,236 --> 00:37:57,139
Behind you, you can see
that these were initially

284
00:37:57,206 --> 00:37:58,474
built to be very tall.

285
00:37:58,540 --> 00:37:59,508
We believe the reasoning for..

286
00:37:59,575 --> 00:38:00,542
We gotta go.

287
00:38:00,609 --> 00:38:01,944
What?
We found the signal.

288
00:38:02,010 --> 00:38:03,145
No, no, no, no.
Can I please just wrap up..

289
00:38:03,212 --> 00:38:04,146
Now, down now.

290
00:38:04,213 --> 00:38:05,914
Oh, shit.
Cut.

291
00:38:15,624 --> 00:38:16,725
Guys, let's go.
Follow me.

292
00:38:16,792 --> 00:38:19,528
This way.
Go.

293
00:38:25,167 --> 00:38:27,002
So apparently,
we've just gotten word

294
00:38:27,069 --> 00:38:30,973
that one of the missing
archaeologists has been found.

295
00:38:31,039 --> 00:38:33,409
They're about 30 miles away
from here.

296
00:38:33,475 --> 00:38:35,043
We got a call on the radio.

297
00:38:35,110 --> 00:38:37,746
So we're trying to get our gear
together as fast as we can,

298
00:38:37,813 --> 00:38:40,182
hopefully make some good time
before it gets too dark,

299
00:38:40,249 --> 00:38:44,253
hoping they're all right or at
least something we can deal with.

300
00:38:44,319 --> 00:38:46,221
So I've got my bag,
we're heading out now.

301
00:38:46,288 --> 00:38:47,990
We gotta go.
Yeah, I know.

302
00:38:48,056 --> 00:38:48,791
I know.
You, too.

303
00:38:48,857 --> 00:38:50,425
Do you have your stuff?

304
00:38:50,492 --> 00:38:51,427
Yeah.
Yeah, I got everything.

305
00:38:51,493 --> 00:38:52,427
Okay, and you got the shot?

306
00:38:52,494 --> 00:38:53,428
Yeah.
Yeah, it's great.

307
00:38:53,495 --> 00:38:54,763
Yeah, I got it.
Awesome.

308
00:39:31,967 --> 00:39:33,468
What the hell is this?

309
00:39:33,535 --> 00:39:35,003
Pennsylvania Dutch?

310
00:39:36,839 --> 00:39:38,640
They're Mennonites.

311
00:39:38,707 --> 00:39:40,776
German Descent.

312
00:39:40,843 --> 00:39:42,978
They're here since 1952.

313
00:39:43,045 --> 00:39:45,581
They're just common farmers.

314
00:39:55,958 --> 00:40:01,763
Buenos dias.
Buenos dias.

315
00:40:01,830 --> 00:40:04,099
Camera down.
Camera.. Camera down.

316
00:40:04,166 --> 00:40:05,500
Now.. Off now.

317
00:40:05,567 --> 00:40:09,238
(Spanish)

318
00:40:32,928 --> 00:40:34,530
They wanna give you a lift.
Get in.

319
00:40:34,596 --> 00:40:37,799
I can walk.
Get in.

320
00:41:35,757 --> 00:41:37,960
(Spanish)

321
00:41:39,995 --> 00:41:43,365
Sir, she's in the hatch over there.

322
00:42:29,711 --> 00:42:32,147
(Spanish)

323
00:43:10,519 --> 00:43:11,753
I know where he is.

324
00:43:11,820 --> 00:43:13,288
You sure you do?

325
00:43:13,355 --> 00:43:14,923
Yes, I know where he is.
I'll take you to him.

326
00:43:14,990 --> 00:43:16,391
You need to show me on a map.

327
00:43:16,458 --> 00:43:18,727
Show you on a map?
I can't show you on a map.

328
00:43:18,794 --> 00:43:21,563
I don't know exactly where I came
from, but I can take you there.

329
00:43:21,630 --> 00:43:24,699
But you get..

330
00:43:24,766 --> 00:43:28,837
Yeah. I can't describe it,
what happened, where it is.

331
00:43:28,904 --> 00:43:30,205
I need to just..

332
00:43:30,272 --> 00:43:32,140
You know what..
You're in a bad state.

333
00:43:32,207 --> 00:43:33,809
You need to get a Heli
Extraction from here.

334
00:43:33,875 --> 00:43:35,410
And how long is that gonna
take, six hours?

335
00:43:35,477 --> 00:43:37,045
I'll take you to Holden.
I know exactly where he is.

336
00:43:37,112 --> 00:43:38,380
No, no, no, no, no, no.
You need to sit down.

337
00:43:38,447 --> 00:43:40,482
I've been out here..
And then you can go.

338
00:43:40,549 --> 00:43:41,817
Thank you very much.

339
00:43:41,883 --> 00:43:43,718
I'm on my own.
I'm just fine.

340
00:43:43,785 --> 00:43:45,087
If you wait out here,

341
00:43:45,153 --> 00:43:46,788
you can tell us the way that
you came in.

342
00:43:46,855 --> 00:43:47,789
I can't tell you.

343
00:43:47,856 --> 00:43:49,157
If I could, I would.

344
00:43:49,224 --> 00:43:51,293
He's out there now at the
site, okay?

345
00:43:51,359 --> 00:43:52,694
You're in no condition
to come with us.

346
00:43:52,761 --> 00:43:54,162
I am fine.
Jesus.

347
00:43:54,229 --> 00:43:55,464
Do not baby me.

348
00:43:55,530 --> 00:43:57,199
You look after her.
She's your responsibility.

349
00:43:57,265 --> 00:43:59,968
You go after her.
You look after her now.

350
00:44:14,282 --> 00:44:16,585
So you're sure it wasn't a helicopter?

351
00:44:16,651 --> 00:44:17,786
I know what a helicopter..

352
00:44:17,853 --> 00:44:20,956
Record this conversation.
Go.

353
00:44:21,022 --> 00:44:24,159
There's no propeller wash,
no wind, nothing.

354
00:44:24,226 --> 00:44:27,062
Okay. So what do you think it was?

355
00:44:29,297 --> 00:44:31,199
At first,
I thought it was one of those

356
00:44:31,266 --> 00:44:35,470
experimental crafts I hear you
guys working on over there.

357
00:44:35,537 --> 00:44:39,674
But then when I saw it,
I just knew it wasn't.

358
00:44:39,741 --> 00:44:44,279
Why not?

359
00:44:44,346 --> 00:44:46,882
I didn't feel..

360
00:44:46,948 --> 00:44:48,717
I didn't feel a human presence.

361
00:44:48,784 --> 00:44:50,352
Something else was watching me.

362
00:44:50,418 --> 00:44:51,987
Hey, Man, can you just piss off?

363
00:44:52,053 --> 00:44:53,188
Hey.
Wow.

364
00:44:53,255 --> 00:44:56,124
The lady said back off, Wanker.

365
00:44:56,191 --> 00:44:58,160
Yeah.
Well, I get that feeling a lot

366
00:44:58,226 --> 00:44:59,895
when the Sergeant back there
looks at me.

367
00:45:02,864 --> 00:45:06,568
Whatever it is, we'll find it,
and we'll find holden.

368
00:45:06,635 --> 00:45:08,403
Promise.

369
00:45:19,147 --> 00:45:20,682
Lights off.
This is it.

370
00:45:20,749 --> 00:45:21,750
Lights off.

371
00:45:21,816 --> 00:45:22,784
This is it.
This is what it..

372
00:45:22,851 --> 00:45:24,653
(Foreign language)

373
00:45:24,719 --> 00:45:27,422
You can't go.
I'm going with or without you.

374
00:45:27,489 --> 00:45:28,824
Castro, follow her.

375
00:45:28,890 --> 00:45:30,125
Follow her.
Guys, move.

376
00:45:30,192 --> 00:45:31,593
Go.
Move, move, move.

377
00:45:31,660 --> 00:45:34,429
Go, go, go, go, go, go.

378
00:45:54,382 --> 00:45:56,484
Don't tell me we're going in
that thing.

379
00:45:56,551 --> 00:45:58,153
Goddamn it.

380
00:46:30,452 --> 00:46:32,020
I don't.. I don't remember.

381
00:46:32,087 --> 00:46:33,521
I don't remember.

382
00:46:33,588 --> 00:46:34,856
Try and remember.

383
00:46:34,923 --> 00:46:36,691
We were dragged.

384
00:46:36,758 --> 00:46:38,093
We were pulled down a corridor.

385
00:46:38,159 --> 00:46:39,828
We were put..
There were green lights.

386
00:46:39,894 --> 00:46:41,463
We were both together.

387
00:46:41,529 --> 00:46:43,865
That's enough.
But he's here.

388
00:46:43,932 --> 00:46:45,433
And we'll find him.
We'll find him.

389
00:46:47,736 --> 00:46:49,537
Let's go.
Carry on.

390
00:47:03,285 --> 00:47:05,687
This, this looks familiar.

391
00:47:05,754 --> 00:47:08,189
It's this way, this way.

392
00:47:18,066 --> 00:47:20,969
I think it's the right.

393
00:47:25,540 --> 00:47:27,842
This seems right.
This seems familiar.

394
00:47:27,909 --> 00:47:30,512
I think.. This is it.

395
00:47:30,578 --> 00:47:33,815
Up here and we turned
a right back there.

396
00:47:33,882 --> 00:47:36,084
Go.

397
00:47:47,896 --> 00:47:49,898
I don't know.
This is it.

398
00:47:49,964 --> 00:47:52,567
This is it.
He should be here.

399
00:47:52,634 --> 00:47:54,169
Is there any blood?

400
00:47:54,235 --> 00:47:55,403
Is there any markings, anything?

401
00:47:59,341 --> 00:48:00,642
There's nothing here.

402
00:48:00,709 --> 00:48:02,477
But I left him here.
This has gotta be it.

403
00:48:02,544 --> 00:48:04,446
Then we're gonna have to leave.

404
00:48:04,512 --> 00:48:06,381
We have to leave.

405
00:48:06,448 --> 00:48:08,049
Okay. What if it was back
at the other turn?

406
00:48:08,116 --> 00:48:09,918
If we went..
Instead of going to the left,

407
00:48:09,985 --> 00:48:11,186
we go back and go to the right?

408
00:48:11,252 --> 00:48:12,721
This is like a maze.
We're getting lost.

409
00:48:12,787 --> 00:48:14,255
Okay. So let's go back,
retrace our steps.

410
00:48:14,322 --> 00:48:16,624
I don't wanna get lost either, okay?

411
00:48:16,691 --> 00:48:18,760
We'll retrack once more.
If we don't find him..

412
00:48:18,827 --> 00:48:19,761
Okay.
We have to exit.

413
00:48:19,828 --> 00:48:20,762
All right.
Okay.

414
00:48:20,829 --> 00:48:21,763
Okay?
Okay, let's go.

415
00:48:25,266 --> 00:48:27,168
Jesus, come on, Man.

416
00:48:38,546 --> 00:48:41,516
It's back down this way.
I think I remember it.

417
00:48:47,822 --> 00:48:49,057
Damn it. Damn it. Damn it.

418
00:48:49,124 --> 00:48:51,159
Fucking shit.

419
00:49:01,636 --> 00:49:02,804
I don't know.

420
00:49:02,871 --> 00:49:03,905
I don't remember.

421
00:49:03,972 --> 00:49:05,373
I thought that was it.

422
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:06,374
There were green lights
on the roof.

423
00:49:06,441 --> 00:49:07,742
There were track marks.

424
00:49:07,809 --> 00:49:10,945
We were stuck between..
I don't remember this.

425
00:49:11,012 --> 00:49:12,514
Gonna have to get..

426
00:49:12,580 --> 00:49:13,982
No, we're not leaving him here.

427
00:49:14,048 --> 00:49:15,483
We'll go out.
We'll get reinforcements.

428
00:49:15,550 --> 00:49:17,318
He's here.
We're gonna get lost.

429
00:49:17,385 --> 00:49:18,753
We don't know what we're dealing with.
We have to go.

430
00:49:18,820 --> 00:49:20,221
I'm not gonna come back and
then wait.

431
00:49:20,288 --> 00:49:21,956
We have to leave.
We have to leave.

432
00:49:22,023 --> 00:49:23,591
What are we gonna do, go back out
there and formulate another plan?

433
00:49:23,658 --> 00:49:25,160
I'm not gonna endanger
eight men for a man.

434
00:49:25,226 --> 00:49:26,628
We're here right now.
We're gonna go.

435
00:49:26,694 --> 00:49:28,997
I'll give the orders.
Let's go.

436
00:49:29,063 --> 00:49:30,265
You wanna..

437
00:49:30,331 --> 00:49:31,699
We gotta go now.
We have to go.. Shh.

438
00:49:31,766 --> 00:49:33,535
We gotta go now.
We have to go now.

439
00:49:33,601 --> 00:49:35,737
Now, let's go. Let's go.

440
00:49:35,804 --> 00:49:37,806
Let's go.
Go, go.

441
00:49:53,555 --> 00:49:54,355
Shit.

442
00:49:54,422 --> 00:49:58,059
She went.
She's gone.

443
00:49:58,126 --> 00:49:59,794
She's gonna get us killed.

444
00:49:59,861 --> 00:50:01,429
Okay.

445
00:50:01,496 --> 00:50:03,565
She could have gone that way.

446
00:50:25,186 --> 00:50:26,321
Where is she?

447
00:50:26,387 --> 00:50:27,589
We have to leave.

448
00:50:27,655 --> 00:50:28,923
This is like a maze.
We're getting lost.

449
00:50:28,990 --> 00:50:30,625
We can't just leave her.

450
00:50:30,692 --> 00:50:32,460
We need to backtrack.
We need to head back.

451
00:50:32,527 --> 00:50:34,829
Did you see which way she went?

452
00:50:34,896 --> 00:50:36,364
We need to go back.

453
00:50:36,431 --> 00:50:37,732
Okay. Let's go.

454
00:50:37,799 --> 00:50:39,200
Okay.
'

455
00:51:08,663 --> 00:51:11,799
Go, go, go, go!
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

456
00:51:11,866 --> 00:51:15,336
Get out of here!
Move, move, move!

457
00:51:17,272 --> 00:51:18,840
Go, go.

458
00:51:27,916 --> 00:51:30,118
Come on, come, come, look.

459
00:51:30,184 --> 00:51:32,620
Move, move, move, move, move.

460
00:51:43,965 --> 00:51:45,400
Move, move, move, move.

461
00:51:45,466 --> 00:51:46,801
Go, go, go, go, go.

462
00:51:59,314 --> 00:52:01,716
Withdraw!
Withdraw!

463
00:52:01,783 --> 00:52:02,884
Withdraw!

464
00:52:02,951 --> 00:52:03,985
Go, go, go.

465
00:52:04,052 --> 00:52:05,053
Go, go, go, go, go, go.

466
00:52:05,119 --> 00:52:06,955
Go, go, go,

467
00:52:07,021 --> 00:52:09,991
move, go, go.

468
00:52:14,729 --> 00:52:16,431
Go, go, go.

469
00:52:23,838 --> 00:52:25,807
Go, go.

470
00:52:26,708 --> 00:52:28,810
It doesn't..

471
00:52:35,850 --> 00:52:37,685
Lights off, lights off,
lights off.

472
00:52:37,752 --> 00:52:39,120
Lights off.

473
00:52:40,822 --> 00:52:41,956
Hello, Zero.

474
00:52:42,023 --> 00:52:44,592
This is One Zero Alpha, over.

475
00:52:45,793 --> 00:52:48,329
Roger.

476
00:52:48,396 --> 00:52:51,766
We are requesting
for extraction now, over.

477
00:52:54,202 --> 00:52:55,737
Roger.

478
00:52:55,803 --> 00:52:57,038
We're out.

479
00:53:01,309 --> 00:53:03,077
Zero, One Zero Alpha.

480
00:53:03,144 --> 00:53:05,780
Speaking now.
Send, over.

481
00:53:07,615 --> 00:53:10,351
Zero, send, over.
Send, over.

482
00:53:14,355 --> 00:53:16,691
Send over.

483
00:53:20,261 --> 00:53:21,529
Roger.

484
00:53:21,596 --> 00:53:24,032
I will plot the location
for extraction point.

485
00:53:24,098 --> 00:53:26,501
Alpha, Bravo, Charlie,

486
00:53:26,567 --> 00:53:30,705
Delta, Echo, India, over.

487
00:53:32,340 --> 00:53:35,009
One Zero Alpha, roger.
Out.

488
00:53:36,077 --> 00:53:37,278
Guys, listen in.

489
00:53:37,345 --> 00:53:38,746
We're moving.

490
00:53:38,813 --> 00:53:40,381
From here,
we're going to extraction point.

491
00:53:40,448 --> 00:53:41,916
Everybody understood?
Understood.

492
00:53:41,983 --> 00:53:43,017
Okay.

493
00:53:43,084 --> 00:53:46,054
You head into that direction,
this direction.

494
00:53:46,120 --> 00:53:48,423
Move.

495
00:54:49,917 --> 00:54:51,786
Fuentes.

496
00:54:51,853 --> 00:54:53,154
Fuentes.

497
00:55:18,646 --> 00:55:20,648
Thompson. Sir?

498
00:55:20,715 --> 00:55:22,817
On the driver side.
Jump in.

499
00:55:40,134 --> 00:55:42,203
No fuel. Dead.

500
00:55:42,270 --> 00:55:43,571
All right, jump off.

501
00:55:45,173 --> 00:55:48,709
Gents. Gentlemen.

502
00:55:48,776 --> 00:55:50,511
Yeah.
Everybody could hear me?

503
00:55:50,578 --> 00:55:52,013
Mm-hmm.

504
00:55:52,079 --> 00:55:55,783
Something weird happened here.
Something not right.

505
00:55:55,850 --> 00:55:57,819
We need to move on this road.

506
00:55:57,885 --> 00:55:59,053
ASAP.

507
00:55:59,120 --> 00:56:01,455
We're going to our next
extraction point.

508
00:56:01,522 --> 00:56:03,124
Let's move out now.

509
00:56:03,191 --> 00:56:04,358
Same order of march.

510
00:56:04,425 --> 00:56:05,827
Move.

511
00:56:05,893 --> 00:56:08,229
What's he talking about?

512
00:56:19,473 --> 00:56:21,909
I got it.

513
00:56:55,676 --> 00:56:57,578
I heard something.

514
00:56:58,546 --> 00:57:03,551
You hear something?
Yeah.

515
00:57:03,618 --> 00:57:05,086
Okay.

516
00:57:05,152 --> 00:57:07,288
We have to.. Right.
Square right, okay?

517
00:57:07,355 --> 00:57:09,357
Something not fucking right.

518
00:57:09,423 --> 00:57:11,425
Something wrong here.

519
00:57:11,492 --> 00:57:13,794
Okay?
Let's go.

520
00:58:10,084 --> 00:58:12,219
Will you fuck off, please?

521
00:58:12,286 --> 00:58:14,088
Back up.

522
00:58:15,923 --> 00:58:19,126
I really don't want it to be
like that.

523
00:58:19,193 --> 00:58:20,628
Turn the camera off.

524
00:58:25,466 --> 00:58:26,701
Hey, come here.

525
00:58:26,767 --> 00:58:27,702
Do you have another memory card?

526
00:58:27,768 --> 00:58:28,703
Hey, what are you doing?

527
00:58:28,769 --> 00:58:29,737
I need to get another card.

528
00:58:29,804 --> 00:58:33,107
Hey, get.. Get down, get down.

529
00:58:33,174 --> 00:58:35,242
Do you have a card?

530
00:58:35,309 --> 00:58:37,645
Mark?
Let's go.

531
00:58:37,712 --> 00:58:40,214
I need another card for my camera.

532
00:59:00,234 --> 00:59:01,936
I just need to talk to him
for a second.

533
00:59:02,003 --> 00:59:04,805
Next time we get a break,
I really need a card.

534
00:59:04,872 --> 00:59:06,974
I can't..

535
00:59:34,001 --> 00:59:36,370
Come here.
Hurry, hurry.

536
01:01:49,703 --> 01:01:51,972
(Muttering)

537
01:02:32,179 --> 01:02:34,548
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

538
01:02:34,615 --> 01:02:37,384
Go, go, go, go!

539
01:02:44,091 --> 01:02:46,260
Go, go, go.

540
01:03:03,544 --> 01:03:06,213
Go, go, go!

541
01:03:12,987 --> 01:03:14,622
Go, go, go, go, go!

542
01:03:33,207 --> 01:03:35,743
He's the archeologist.
All right.

543
01:03:35,809 --> 01:03:37,611
Stay with her.

544
01:03:40,080 --> 01:03:41,515
Take control of him.

545
01:03:41,582 --> 01:03:43,450
We don't need..
Take control of him.

546
01:03:43,517 --> 01:03:44,585
No noise.

547
01:03:45,953 --> 01:03:47,755
Laura.

548
01:03:47,821 --> 01:03:49,623
Get Radio Coms now.

549
01:03:52,259 --> 01:03:55,095
Tilt his head back.

550
01:03:57,364 --> 01:03:58,699
Laura!

551
01:03:58,766 --> 01:04:00,768
Shh, shh.

552
01:04:00,834 --> 01:04:02,836
He's getting compromising.

553
01:04:04,672 --> 01:04:06,807
No Coms. No Coms.

554
01:04:06,874 --> 01:04:10,511
Guys, listen in.
No Coms.

555
01:04:10,577 --> 01:04:12,046
Can't get Coms till we hit Zero.

556
01:04:12,112 --> 01:04:13,047
Laura.

557
01:04:13,113 --> 01:04:14,081
We need to move out now.

558
01:04:14,148 --> 01:04:15,449
We're going to higher ground,

559
01:04:15,516 --> 01:04:18,285
probably we get Coms from
there, all right?

560
01:04:18,352 --> 01:04:19,586
All right, listen in.

561
01:04:19,653 --> 01:04:22,222
Everybody here now?
Everybody intact?

562
01:04:22,289 --> 01:04:23,424
Yeah.

563
01:04:23,490 --> 01:04:24,925
All right, listen in.
We're moving now.

564
01:04:24,992 --> 01:04:28,228
Thompson, help her, okay?

565
01:04:28,295 --> 01:04:29,630
Yes, Sir.
Watch for him.

566
01:04:29,697 --> 01:04:30,664
Sir.

567
01:04:30,731 --> 01:04:31,732
Let's move.

568
01:04:42,443 --> 01:04:44,044
Laura!

569
01:04:44,111 --> 01:04:45,412
Shh, shh, shh.

570
01:04:47,548 --> 01:04:49,316
Keep the noise down.

571
01:04:49,383 --> 01:04:51,218
I'm trying the best I can.

572
01:04:51,285 --> 01:04:53,487
Keep the goddamn noise down.

573
01:04:55,522 --> 01:04:58,192
It's okay, we'll get you out,
all right?

574
01:05:01,829 --> 01:05:03,597
Laura. Shh.

575
01:05:03,664 --> 01:05:05,766
Listen.

576
01:05:05,833 --> 01:05:08,869
Thompson, keep her..
Okay?

577
01:05:08,936 --> 01:05:10,337
Laura.

578
01:05:25,786 --> 01:05:27,454
Laura.

579
01:07:46,293 --> 01:07:48,395
What's going on?

580
01:08:04,211 --> 01:08:05,746
Get it.

581
01:08:05,812 --> 01:08:06,947
Pop.

582
01:08:26,066 --> 01:08:28,535
Down!

583
01:08:29,436 --> 01:08:31,004
Down! Down!

584
01:08:34,408 --> 01:08:37,311
Move! Go, go.

585
01:08:50,490 --> 01:08:52,759
Phil, stay here.

586
01:08:53,627 --> 01:08:56,630
Where's he going?

587
01:08:56,697 --> 01:08:58,899
What's going on?
Where's the troop?

588
01:09:09,910 --> 01:09:13,614
What the fuck.
Move, move, move!

589
01:09:17,484 --> 01:09:20,887
Linda, go, go, go, go!

590
01:09:41,775 --> 01:09:43,677
Go!

591
01:09:58,959 --> 01:10:00,661
Move!

592
01:10:06,400 --> 01:10:07,768
Let's move!
Withdraw!

593
01:10:07,834 --> 01:10:10,203
Withdraw! Withdraw! Withdraw!

594
01:10:10,270 --> 01:10:11,705
Let's go!

595
01:10:11,772 --> 01:10:13,740
Move, move, move, move, move!

596
01:10:18,011 --> 01:10:20,013
I told you, go.

597
01:10:21,415 --> 01:10:24,918
Move, move, move, move,
move, move, move, move!

598
01:10:25,986 --> 01:10:26,953
Let's fucking go.

599
01:10:27,020 --> 01:10:28,955
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

600
01:10:34,161 --> 01:10:36,997
You, get up.

601
01:10:37,064 --> 01:10:39,132
Hurry.
Move.

602
01:10:45,706 --> 01:10:49,443
I don't know what the fuck it is,

603
01:10:49,509 --> 01:10:51,578
but it sure ain't us.

604
01:10:51,645 --> 01:10:54,448
Where's our fucking Med?

605
01:10:54,514 --> 01:10:55,882
Have you seen it?

606
01:11:06,126 --> 01:11:08,995
Withdraw. Withdraw.

607
01:11:09,062 --> 01:11:10,464
Just go.
Get out.

608
01:12:16,830 --> 01:12:18,231
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

609
01:12:30,477 --> 01:12:32,913
We've lost the cover!

610
01:12:40,353 --> 01:12:43,190
Go! Go!

611
01:12:57,571 --> 01:13:00,073
Oh, my.. Oh.

612
01:13:04,444 --> 01:13:07,581
Come on, go!

613
01:13:17,524 --> 01:13:19,092
Withdraw!

614
01:13:28,468 --> 01:13:30,203
Move, move!

615
01:13:34,174 --> 01:13:36,209
Move, move!

616
01:13:47,420 --> 01:13:48,588
Where is it?

617
01:13:48,655 --> 01:13:50,190
It's gone.

618
01:13:50,257 --> 01:13:51,391
Where did it go?

619
01:13:59,699 --> 01:14:02,502
Everybody is here, right?

620
01:14:02,569 --> 01:14:04,004
I'll be in charge now.

621
01:14:04,070 --> 01:14:05,205
Everybody woop.

622
01:14:05,272 --> 01:14:06,273
Woop.

623
01:14:06,339 --> 01:14:07,607
Okay. Let's move out.

624
01:14:09,910 --> 01:14:12,279
Shh.

625
01:14:43,209 --> 01:14:45,745
Move back.

626
01:14:47,580 --> 01:14:49,382
Move it!
Move!

627
01:14:50,550 --> 01:14:53,186
Move, move, move!

628
01:14:53,253 --> 01:14:54,988
Move.

629
01:14:59,092 --> 01:15:00,794
Move.

630
01:15:06,533 --> 01:15:08,134
Move, move, move.

631
01:15:08,201 --> 01:15:09,936
Move.

632
01:15:19,045 --> 01:15:20,780
Come on.

633
01:15:22,349 --> 01:15:24,150
Damn!

634
01:15:32,625 --> 01:15:33,994
Okay?
Yeah.

635
01:15:34,060 --> 01:15:36,730
Come on. Go.

636
01:15:47,073 --> 01:15:50,744
Come on, let's go, let's go,
let's go, let's go, let's go.

637
01:16:09,396 --> 01:16:12,332
One Zero, Zero,
Zero Alpha, over.

638
01:16:15,602 --> 01:16:18,872
One Zero to Alpha, over.

639
01:16:19,906 --> 01:16:22,976
One Zero Alpha, nothing heard.

640
01:16:24,044 --> 01:16:26,379
No Coms.

641
01:16:26,446 --> 01:16:27,547
Everybody good?
Woop.

642
01:16:27,614 --> 01:16:29,249
Let's move out.

643
01:16:58,578 --> 01:16:59,646
Move, move!

644
01:17:00,980 --> 01:17:03,316
Move, move, move, move, move,
move, move.

645
01:17:09,422 --> 01:17:11,257
Move, move, move, move, move,
move, move.

646
01:17:11,324 --> 01:17:13,193
Withdraw!

647
01:17:13,259 --> 01:17:14,594
Move, move, move.

648
01:17:15,829 --> 01:17:17,797
Move, move, move, move.

649
01:17:19,065 --> 01:17:22,035
Move, move, move, move, move.
Withdraw! Withdraw!

650
01:17:51,931 --> 01:17:53,133
You hear that?

651
01:17:59,105 --> 01:18:02,175
Watch out, watch out!
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

652
01:18:02,242 --> 01:18:03,243
Come on!

653
01:18:17,624 --> 01:18:18,958
I'm gonna follow him.

654
01:18:21,127 --> 01:18:22,795
We don't have..

655
01:18:22,862 --> 01:18:24,597
(Muttering)

656
01:18:24,664 --> 01:18:26,866
We're gonna use the jungle.

657
01:18:30,303 --> 01:18:32,772
We're gonna make some booby traps.

658
01:18:32,839 --> 01:18:34,240
Are you guys gonna help me?

659
01:18:39,646 --> 01:18:43,049
Okay. Fine.
Let's do it.

660
01:18:43,116 --> 01:18:45,618
Let's go.

661
01:19:15,815 --> 01:19:17,517
Yeah.

662
01:19:51,117 --> 01:19:53,519
Move, move, move,
move, move, move, move!

663
01:19:55,488 --> 01:19:56,489
Move, move, move!

664
01:19:56,556 --> 01:19:59,926
Move, move, move, move, move, move!

665
01:19:59,993 --> 01:20:01,361
Get back, get back!

666
01:20:01,427 --> 01:20:03,930
Move, move, move, move, move.

667
01:20:03,997 --> 01:20:04,931
Move, move!

668
01:20:04,998 --> 01:20:06,466
Move, move!

669
01:20:06,532 --> 01:20:08,034
Move, move, move!

670
01:20:08,101 --> 01:20:10,303
Move, move, move, move!

671
01:21:15,835 --> 01:21:17,303
Whoa.

672
01:21:17,370 --> 01:21:18,738
Shit.

673
01:21:21,808 --> 01:21:23,643
Oh, shit.

674
01:21:23,710 --> 01:21:27,180
Shit.

675
01:21:27,246 --> 01:21:28,614
Ooh, he's dead, he's dead.

676
01:21:29,882 --> 01:21:31,417
Get up!
Let's go, let's go.

677
01:21:31,484 --> 01:21:32,985
Let's go, let's go.

678
01:21:33,052 --> 01:21:34,620
Let's go, let's go.

679
01:23:39,879 --> 01:23:42,148
Shit, fuck.

680
01:23:44,217 --> 01:23:45,885
Over there.

681
01:23:49,055 --> 01:23:51,424
Shit, I can't see.

682
01:24:35,134 --> 01:24:36,903
Go, go, go!

683
01:25:19,545 --> 01:25:21,581
Will you fuck off, please?

684
01:25:21,647 --> 01:25:23,649
Back up!

685
01:25:23,716 --> 01:25:26,752
Our idea of what it means to
be human changes all the time.

686
01:25:26,819 --> 01:25:30,489
Through genetic sequencing,
we now know that Europeans

687
01:25:30,556 --> 01:25:33,426
carry up to 4% Neanderthal DNA.

688
01:25:33,492 --> 01:25:35,695
Nearly 5% of the people
in the South Pacific,

689
01:25:35,761 --> 01:25:40,299
they carry Denisovan DNA from a
Hominid we just discovered in 2008.

690
01:25:40,366 --> 01:25:46,305
Modern humans, they mixed with an
entirely different species of Hominids.

691
01:25:46,372 --> 01:25:50,943
It's not just relatives,
but a complete different species.

692
01:25:51,010 --> 01:25:55,047
What's this have to do with
our problem?

693
01:25:55,114 --> 01:25:59,819
This thing, I had
it's DNA analyzed and,

694
01:25:59,885 --> 01:26:03,456
well, it's us.

695
01:26:03,522 --> 01:26:07,026
It's a 70% match for modern human.

696
01:26:07,093 --> 01:26:08,294
This thing is our ancestor.

697
01:26:08,361 --> 01:26:10,029
It's everyone's ancestor.

698
01:26:10,096 --> 01:26:12,898
It's.. The Neanderthal,
Denisovans, modern humans,

699
01:26:12,965 --> 01:26:15,468
they all have DNA that matches
this thing.

700
01:26:15,534 --> 01:26:18,671
So that means it's just
another Primitive Hominid

701
01:26:18,738 --> 01:26:19,972
that humans have mated with.

702
01:26:20,039 --> 01:26:21,140
No, no, no. It's not.

703
01:26:21,207 --> 01:26:23,676
It's what was piloting that ship.
