1
00:00:10,035 --> 00:00:13,000
# Christmastime is almost here again #

2
00:00:13,035 --> 00:00:17,000
# People come
from far and near again #

3
00:00:17,035 --> 00:00:24,000
# Isn't Christmastime
a wonderful thing #

4
00:00:24,035 --> 00:00:28,000
# Deck the halls
and hang the mistletoe #

5
00:00:28,035 --> 00:00:32,000
# Kiss the one you love
and let 'em know #

6
00:00:32,035 --> 00:00:35,000
# Isn't Christmastime
a wonderful thing #

7
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:38,000
There are three things
that all New Yorkers strive for:

8
00:00:38,035 --> 00:00:41,000
the perfect job,
the perfect apartment, and the perfect fiance:

9
00:00:41,035 --> 00:00:45,000
How did I, E:J: Baxter, manage
to pull off that trifecta?

10
00:00:45,035 --> 00:00:48,000
Because I never took "no"for an answer:::

11
00:00:48,035 --> 00:00:50,000
even if it made me miserable:

12
00:00:50,035 --> 00:00:52,000
J:, it's Susan Curtsonis:

13
00:00:52,035 --> 00:00:54,000
Look, I really appreciate your interest...

14
00:00:54,035 --> 00:00:57,000
but we're perfectly happy with
the public relations company we have.

15
00:00:57,035 --> 00:01:00,000
Have a happy holiday.

16
00:01:00,035 --> 00:01:02,000
Susan Curtsonis's office:

17
00:01:02,035 --> 00:01:03,000
I'm sorry, but she's not here.

18
00:01:03,035 --> 00:01:06,000
Actually, I wasn't calling to pitch her account.

19
00:01:06,035 --> 00:01:08,000
I was calling you, Cindy.

20
00:01:08,035 --> 00:01:13,000
- Despite the outcome, you have been a reaI class act.
- Thank you.

21
00:01:13,035 --> 00:01:15,000
If I can ever be of any help

22
00:01:15,035 --> 00:01:17,000
Look, thanks for calling,
but I've got to go spend my lunch hour...

23
00:01:17,035 --> 00:01:21,000
standing in line trying to get Coldplay tickets.

24
00:01:21,035 --> 00:01:24,000
I can't believe you did thisl

25
00:01:24,035 --> 00:01:26,000
New Year's Eve and they're all sold out!

26
00:01:26,035 --> 00:01:28,000
Ah, I knew you wanted them.

27
00:01:28,035 --> 00:01:30,000
Just make sure to hold onto
those backstage passes.

28
00:01:30,035 --> 00:01:33,000
I don't understand why Susan
won't take a meeting with you.

29
00:01:33,035 --> 00:01:36,000
The thing is,
I just need 10 minutes of her time anywhere.

30
00:01:36,035 --> 00:01:38,000
Doesn't even need to be her office.

31
00:01:38,035 --> 00:01:39,000
That hair color can't be naturaI.

32
00:01:39,035 --> 00:01:42,000
Where and when does she get
her roots done? Or her nails?

33
00:01:42,035 --> 00:01:47,000
She had them all done yesterday.
But there is one place she goes.

34
00:01:47,035 --> 00:01:49,000
You have approximately five minutes...

35
00:01:49,035 --> 00:01:51,000
to tell me why I should switch agencies, E.J.

36
00:01:51,035 --> 00:01:54,000
- Gotcha, Susan. The problem with the campaign
- No, E.J.

37
00:01:54,035 --> 00:01:58,000
In here. You do spin, don't you?

38
00:01:58,035 --> 00:02:02,000
Oh. Do I spin?

39
00:02:02,035 --> 00:02:04,000
All right, you guys, take it up:

40
00:02:04,035 --> 00:02:06,000
Out of that saddle, going into those push-ups:

41
00:02:06,035 --> 00:02:08,000
In four, three

42
00:02:08,035 --> 00:02:11,000
Down and up:
Here we go: Down and up:

43
00:02:11,035 --> 00:02:13,000
Down and up: Two more:

44
00:02:13,035 --> 00:02:16,000
Down, up. Last one.

45
00:02:16,035 --> 00:02:19,000
Sit and sprint, as fast as you can.

46
00:02:19,035 --> 00:02:21,000
Don't stop: Keep that head up:

47
00:02:21,035 --> 00:02:23,000
Trip Advisor rates your flagship hoteI...

48
00:02:23,035 --> 00:02:26,000
as only number 247 in New York.

49
00:02:26,035 --> 00:02:28,000
Even if it's primarily a business hoteI...

50
00:02:28,035 --> 00:02:31,000
I don't understand why your current campaign...

51
00:02:31,035 --> 00:02:34,000
doesn't promise business travelers something
they can't get at home.

52
00:02:34,035 --> 00:02:35,000
And one: Let's take it back up:

53
00:02:35,035 --> 00:02:38,000
Front, front, side, side.

54
00:02:38,035 --> 00:02:42,000
Front, front, side, side:

55
00:02:42,035 --> 00:02:44,000
- For example
- Great job, guys: Keep it up:

56
00:02:44,035 --> 00:02:47,000
Fashion launch party
celebrating our client Donatella Versace...

57
00:02:47,035 --> 00:02:50,000
sipping our client, Laurent-Perrier champagne...

58
00:02:50,035 --> 00:02:52,000
which gets featured at Conde Nast...

59
00:02:52,035 --> 00:02:55,000
where my ex-assistant now works as an editor.

60
00:02:55,035 --> 00:02:57,000
All the way up:

61
00:02:57,035 --> 00:03:00,000
- Sharon Byrons?
- Call back.

62
00:03:00,035 --> 00:03:02,000
- Jeff Field?
- Call back.

63
00:03:02,035 --> 00:03:04,000
Jackie Bescher?

64
00:03:04,035 --> 00:03:07,000
Call her back and tell her she'll have it in her
inbox in the morning when she wakes up.

65
00:03:07,035 --> 00:03:10,000
- Now, you arranged for a car to
take us to the airport? - Uh-huh.

66
00:03:10,035 --> 00:03:11,000
Everyone has my number at Le Toiny?

67
00:03:11,035 --> 00:03:14,000
I don't know why you'd want anybody to bother
you in St. Barts, but uh-huh.

68
00:03:14,035 --> 00:03:17,000
There's always an emergency.
Who else?

69
00:03:17,035 --> 00:03:19,000
Uh, Ellen Plack.

70
00:03:19,035 --> 00:03:22,000
Ah! Let's get her.
I just want to talk to Lillah for a second.

71
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:26,000
Oh, and can you send someone out to get
a bottle of ibuprofen?

72
00:03:26,035 --> 00:03:28,000
An extra large bottle.

73
00:03:28,035 --> 00:03:31,000
You did what?

74
00:03:31,035 --> 00:03:34,000
What community college
R: class did you learn that one in?

75
00:03:34,035 --> 00:03:36,000
Would you get with the program already?

76
00:03:36,035 --> 00:03:40,000
Why do I have to spell out
everything all the time?

77
00:03:40,035 --> 00:03:43,000
- I got the Curtsonis account.
- How the hell did you manage to convince her?

78
00:03:43,035 --> 00:03:46,000
Ah, it's nothing.

79
00:03:46,035 --> 00:03:49,000
Well, we'll have a drink
at the party later to celebrate.

80
00:03:49,035 --> 00:03:53,000
Besides you, E.J., I do not have a single person
in this company who gets it.

81
00:03:53,035 --> 00:03:55,000
Ah.

82
00:03:55,035 --> 00:03:56,000
Well, maybe Noah.

83
00:03:56,035 --> 00:04:00,000
But even you, his fiancee,
know he's hardly perfect.

84
00:04:00,035 --> 00:04:04,000
Well, he'll do untiI perfect comes along.

85
00:04:12,035 --> 00:04:16,000
# The days are short, the nights are long #

86
00:04:16,035 --> 00:04:18,000
J: ] Okay, Noah, who's next?

87
00:04:18,035 --> 00:04:20,000
There's Mark Madden.

88
00:04:20,035 --> 00:04:24,000
Fortune once called him the most lusted after
manageriaI star to never become CEO.

89
00:04:24,035 --> 00:04:26,000
Poor guy.

90
00:04:26,035 --> 00:04:29,000
Maybe he's waiting for the right offer, the
right time, and the right environment.

91
00:04:29,035 --> 00:04:31,000
I love you, but if anyone
ever spun me like that I'd be out on a ledge.

92
00:04:31,035 --> 00:04:33,000
Sorry, Noah. Force of habit.

93
00:04:33,035 --> 00:04:36,000
Oh, F.Y. I.,
I made us an appointment with the caterer...

94
00:04:36,035 --> 00:04:38,000
to taste the hot and cold amuse-bouche.

95
00:04:38,035 --> 00:04:40,000
Why don't you handle that one by yourself?

96
00:04:40,035 --> 00:04:44,000
I promise I will be amused by your bouche:

97
00:04:44,035 --> 00:04:47,000
My contacts are killing me.

98
00:04:47,035 --> 00:04:50,000
- Well, when you leave them
in too long, they dry out.

99
00:04:50,035 --> 00:04:52,000
- Don't rub them.
- You always say that.

100
00:04:52,035 --> 00:04:54,000
- And then you always rub them.
- Oh Oh, God.

101
00:04:54,035 --> 00:04:58,000
- The left one just shifted. I think it's lost in my eye.
- Here, honey, let me see.

102
00:04:58,035 --> 00:05:00,000
No, I got it.

103
00:05:02,035 --> 00:05:05,000
Go take your cute little butt
for one last turn around the room.

104
00:05:05,035 --> 00:05:08,000
- Then we'll go home.
- Sounds like a plan.

105
00:05:08,035 --> 00:05:12,000
# Ask the children
They all know #

106
00:05:15,035 --> 00:05:19,000
Hi, Roz. I'm at the Christmas party.

107
00:05:19,035 --> 00:05:22,000
Alert, alert, alert. I just got a call.

108
00:05:22,035 --> 00:05:24,000
Prada sample sale tomorrow.

109
00:05:24,035 --> 00:05:28,000
You guys are going to Paris
next week. Don't you just want to shop there?

110
00:05:28,035 --> 00:05:32,000
Well, of course. But there's no harm in looking.
Everything's at least 40% off.

111
00:05:32,035 --> 00:05:35,000
Oh, we are so there.

112
00:05:35,035 --> 00:05:36,000
Hey!

113
00:05:36,035 --> 00:05:40,000
Oh! You wouldn't believe
what's going on in the bathroom behind me.

114
00:05:40,035 --> 00:05:43,000
This is New York. I wouldn't believe it if there
wasn't something going on behind you.

115
00:05:43,035 --> 00:05:47,000
Oh! He's wearing new
Dolce & Gabbana shoes. Nice.

116
00:05:50,035 --> 00:05:54,000
Wait a minute. I not only know those shoes,
I schlepped them back from Milan!

117
00:05:54,035 --> 00:05:56,000
Oh! Whoa!

118
00:06:00,035 --> 00:06:03,000
Let me guess.
She's giving you your Christmas bonus.

119
00:06:03,035 --> 00:06:07,000
- E.J., please don't make a big deaI out of this.
- Guess I don't rate.

120
00:06:07,035 --> 00:06:09,000
All she gave me was a fruitcake.

121
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:13,000
Look, E.J., you're too smart
not to know that sometimes things just happen.

122
00:06:13,035 --> 00:06:16,000
And once you process and accept them

123
00:06:16,035 --> 00:06:18,000
- What am I missing?
- Call you back.

124
00:06:18,035 --> 00:06:21,000
Darling, you know, I must admit
I really misjudged Noah.

125
00:06:21,035 --> 00:06:33,000
You've got a great one here.
You really should be nice to him.

126
00:06:33,035 --> 00:06:53,000
Oh, my

127
00:06:53,035 --> 00:06:58,000
- Let me ask you something, Bill.
- It's Bob.

128
00:06:58,035 --> 00:07:01,000
Have you ever broken a pair of heels
off some Gucci pumps?

129
00:07:01,035 --> 00:07:03,000
Can't say that I have.

130
00:07:03,035 --> 00:07:06,000
Oh, I gotta tell you
it's totally worth getting fired over.

131
00:07:06,035 --> 00:07:10,000
I mean, I can find another job like that.

132
00:07:10,035 --> 00:07:15,000
But do you do you know how hard it is
to find a guy like No

133
00:07:15,035 --> 00:07:17,000
You mean Noah?

134
00:07:17,035 --> 00:07:20,000
- Everybody said we were perfect for each other.
- Mmm.

135
00:07:20,035 --> 00:07:22,000
I mean, perfect! I mean, everybody!

136
00:07:22,035 --> 00:07:25,000
- Didn't you?
- I don't know him.

137
00:07:25,035 --> 00:07:28,000
And you don't want to. He's a jackass!

138
00:07:28,035 --> 00:07:33,000
But we had the same ambitions
and goals in life.

139
00:07:33,035 --> 00:07:36,000
And yeah, yeah, I could've been a totaI girI
about the whole thing...

140
00:07:36,035 --> 00:07:38,000
and waited for him to propose...

141
00:07:38,035 --> 00:07:43,000
but I-I-I-I took the initiative
and he accepted the offer.

142
00:07:43,035 --> 00:07:46,000
Well, it's quite

143
00:07:46,035 --> 00:07:48,000
Killer ring.

144
00:07:48,035 --> 00:07:50,000
Mmm.

145
00:07:50,035 --> 00:07:53,000
This was one merger
I really thought was gonna last.

146
00:08:13,035 --> 00:08:19,000
Hi.

147
00:08:19,035 --> 00:08:22,000
- How are you?
- How do you think I am?

148
00:08:22,035 --> 00:08:25,000
Okay, I deserve that.

149
00:08:25,035 --> 00:08:30,000
I realize the reason you didn't call me back was
that you needed some space, some time to think.

150
00:08:30,035 --> 00:08:33,000
Why'd you do it, Noah?

151
00:08:33,035 --> 00:08:36,000
A million reasons,
probably none of them good enough.

152
00:08:36,035 --> 00:08:45,000
Just give one good one.

153
00:08:45,035 --> 00:08:47,000
I see.

154
00:08:47,035 --> 00:08:50,000
Well, don't worry about me.

155
00:08:50,035 --> 00:08:52,000
I'm fine. I'm great.

156
00:08:52,035 --> 00:08:53,000
- Do I look not great?
- No, no.

157
00:08:53,035 --> 00:08:55,000
You look amazing.

158
00:08:55,035 --> 00:08:58,000
That's because I could give lessons in amazing.

159
00:08:58,035 --> 00:09:04,000
This is not the right time to talk about this,
but I was hoping I could get my ring back.

160
00:09:04,035 --> 00:09:06,000
I'm sorry. I realize what that must sound like.

161
00:09:06,035 --> 00:09:08,000
No. Really, thank you.

162
00:09:08,035 --> 00:09:15,000
You just made everything a lot easier.

163
00:09:15,035 --> 00:09:18,000
- What's going on?
- I don't know. It's not coming off.

164
00:09:18,035 --> 00:09:20,000
- Why? Did you gain weight?
- Yes, Noah!

165
00:09:20,035 --> 00:09:24,000
I gained 50 pounds since I caught you
screwing Lillah last night.

166
00:09:24,035 --> 00:09:26,000
- Here.
- I realize I acted like a jerk.

167
00:09:26,035 --> 00:09:28,000
Okay, worse.

168
00:09:28,035 --> 00:09:31,000
I don't blame you for hating me, E.J.

169
00:09:31,035 --> 00:09:36,000
In spite of everything,
I still I really care about you.

170
00:09:36,035 --> 00:09:39,000
If there's anything you need me to do
or anyone you need me to call

171
00:09:39,035 --> 00:09:42,000
You are so thoughtfuI, Noah,
but I don't need your help.

172
00:09:42,035 --> 00:09:45,000
My phone sheet is already five pages long.

173
00:09:45,035 --> 00:09:48,000
Not one person has called me, Roz.

174
00:09:48,035 --> 00:09:51,000
Well, maybe you should go somewhere
for a couple of days and just de-stress.

175
00:09:51,035 --> 00:09:54,000
It's too late.
All the decent places are booked.

176
00:09:54,035 --> 00:09:57,000
Do you want us to stay home
with you? You shouldn't be alone right now.

177
00:09:57,035 --> 00:10:00,000
- I want you and Howie to go to Paris.
- Oh, Paris.

178
00:10:00,035 --> 00:10:03,000
It's no big deaI. It's not like
there's anything exciting to do there.

179
00:10:03,035 --> 00:10:07,000
- I can put the money towards
getting a new new face.

180
00:10:07,035 --> 00:10:09,000
Go to Paris.

181
00:10:09,035 --> 00:10:12,000
Since Mom and Dad are gone,
Christmas means nothing to me.

182
00:10:12,035 --> 00:10:15,000
I have plenty to keep myself busy here.
And thanks for letting me stay.

# Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way #

# Oh, what fun it is to ride in
a one-horse open sleigh, hey #

185
00:10:24,035 --> 00:10:28,000
Hey! Shoo.

186
00:10:28,035 --> 00:10:30,000
All the way

187
00:10:30,035 --> 00:10:33,000
Woman ] You must believe in Mr: Kringle
and keep right on doing it:

188
00:10:33,035 --> 00:10:37,000
- You must have faith in him.
- But he didn't get me the

189
00:10:37,035 --> 00:10:39,000
That doesn't make sense, Mommy.

190
00:10:39,035 --> 00:10:44,000
Faith is believing
in things when common sense tells you not to.

191
00:10:44,035 --> 00:10:45,000
Girl ]
Huh?

192
00:10:45,035 --> 00:10:48,000
- Just because things don't turn
out the way you want them to:::

193
00:10:50,035 --> 00:10:52,000
you've still got to believe in them:

194
00:10:52,035 --> 00:10:55,000
Okay.

195
00:10:55,035 --> 00:11:05,000
It's good, isn't it?

196

Four::: three::: two::: one:

00:11:13,035 --> 00:11:29,000
Happy New Year!

Oh, hey. Hey.

199
00:11:42,035 --> 00:11:45,000
Happy new year, Cathy. It's E.J. Baxter.

200
00:11:45,035 --> 00:11:49,000
Yes! I know. I've been wanting
to call you for so long.

201
00:11:49,035 --> 00:11:50,000
How are you?

202
00:11:50,035 --> 00:11:53,000
I don't have to tell you
what a team player I am, Corey.

203
00:11:53,035 --> 00:11:56,000
Mmm, I remember the day
I hired you as my assistant.

204
00:11:56,035 --> 00:12:00,000
I thought if I could just buy stock in this guy

205
00:12:00,035 --> 00:12:01,000
How right I was.

206
00:12:01,035 --> 00:12:05,000
Sue, your problem is not your product,
but your lack of brand loyalty:

207
00:12:05,035 --> 00:12:08,000
Last year, Simon,
in addition to juggling all my own accounts...

208
00:12:08,035 --> 00:12:12,000
I was responsible for bringing in 18%
of all new business.

209
00:12:12,035 --> 00:12:14,000
This isn't about me, Eve.

210
00:12:14,035 --> 00:12:17,000
It's about what I can do
to help your business grow.

211
00:12:17,035 --> 00:12:19,000
Yes. Yes.

212
00:12:19,035 --> 00:12:22,000
You call me back at your earliest convenience.

213
00:12:22,035 --> 00:12:24,000
Thank you. Thank you.

214
00:12:24,035 --> 00:12:27,000
Good-bye.

215
00:12:27,035 --> 00:12:31,000
I never knew there were so many variations of
Don't call us, we'll call you. "

216
00:12:31,035 --> 00:12:34,000
Oh, Lillah can't blackball you
all over the city.

217
00:12:34,035 --> 00:12:36,000
She's done a damn good job so far.

218
00:12:36,035 --> 00:12:38,000
How can this be happening, Roz? How?

219
00:12:38,035 --> 00:12:40,000
- I'm really, really good.
- The best.

220
00:12:40,035 --> 00:12:44,000
- Lost my livelihood, my
reputation, my 24-hour doorman. - Oh!

221
00:12:44,035 --> 00:12:47,000
I understand most people wouldn't want to
cross Lillah by hiring me...

222
00:12:47,035 --> 00:12:49,000
but there are legions
of her former victims out there.

223
00:12:49,035 --> 00:12:53,000
- You'd think one of them would
- Well, you got that offer from Kaplan and McGuire.

224
00:12:53,035 --> 00:12:57,000
I can't take that crappy,
two-bit job offer from that fleabag agency.

225
00:12:57,035 --> 00:13:02,000
- What would that look like out there? Desperate City.
- You are not desperate.

226
00:13:02,035 --> 00:13:04,000
Then again, I just don't want to
sit around and wait for an offer...

227
00:13:04,035 --> 00:13:08,000
and be like, Oh, I'm just enjoying life,
taking my time, considering my options. "

228
00:13:08,035 --> 00:13:10,000
No one ever believes that spin:

229
00:13:10,035 --> 00:13:12,000
E.J., E.J., honey, it is a horrible economy...

230
00:13:12,035 --> 00:13:15,000
and you have only been looking
for a few months.

231
00:13:15,035 --> 00:13:19,000
I promise you there's a great job
out there with your name on it.

232
00:13:19,035 --> 00:13:22,000
None.

233
00:13:22,035 --> 00:13:25,000
Well, there is this one offer,
but it's

234
00:13:25,035 --> 00:13:29,000
- It's so ridiculous, I don't even want to discuss it.
- What?

235
00:13:29,035 --> 00:13:33,000
The mayor of Kalispell, Montana
wants to hire me for a year...

236
00:13:33,035 --> 00:13:37,000
to start a pilot program to lure
corporate retreats there.

237
00:13:37,035 --> 00:13:38,000
This is a great idea!

238
00:13:38,035 --> 00:13:42,000
N- No, Montana is exactly
where you should be:

239
00:13:42,035 --> 00:13:44,000
Less pressure.

240
00:13:44,035 --> 00:13:48,000
You will not be reminded of your life
in New York in any way in Montana.

241
00:13:48,035 --> 00:13:50,000
That's because there is
no such place as Montana.

242
00:13:50,035 --> 00:13:54,000
It's just a big hole
in the ground, says Montana. "

243
00:13:54,035 --> 00:13:56,000
Don't you remember
Daddy always told us...

244
00:13:56,035 --> 00:13:58,000
the only people that lived in Montana are
the people that sweep the dirt off the sign?

245
00:13:58,035 --> 00:14:02,000
You do also realize he was also an alcoholic
womanizer who made Bernie Madoff look honest?

246
00:14:02,035 --> 00:14:06,000
- Maybe so, but he was sincere when he said it.
- Oh, he was. He was.

247
00:14:06,035 --> 00:14:11,000
Honey, listen. If there was ever a time for you
to think beyond the box, this is it.

248
00:14:11,035 --> 00:14:15,000
- And you know you could do that job in your sleep.
- What do I do when I'm awake?

249
00:14:15,035 --> 00:14:17,000
Just think of it as a paid vacation.

250
00:14:17,035 --> 00:14:20,000
You are going crazy sitting around here
waiting for the phone to ring.

251
00:14:20,035 --> 00:14:24,000
You need to go somewhere where you will
not be constantly reminded of Noah...

252
00:14:24,035 --> 00:14:27,000
and the situation,
and the fact that, you know...

253
00:14:27,035 --> 00:14:30,000
your life hasn't turned out
exactly the way you had it planned out.

254
00:14:30,035 --> 00:14:33,000
- I'm a New Yorker, Roz. I need the hustle and bustle.
- It's a year.

255
00:14:33,035 --> 00:14:36,000
What's 12 months? You'll be back before
you're finished unpacking your purses.

256
00:14:36,035 --> 00:14:40,000
- But
- But... what?

257
00:14:40,035 --> 00:14:45,000
What if no one here wants me back?

258
00:14:45,035 --> 00:14:46,000
Oh, honey.

259
00:14:46,035 --> 00:14:49,000
Honey, they will.

260
00:14:49,035 --> 00:14:52,000
Emma Jane. Oh, Emma Jane!

261
00:14:52,035 --> 00:14:58,000
I have a good feeling about this.

262
00:15:03,035 --> 00:15:04,000

263

Can I help you, ma'am?

290
00:16:23,035 --> 00:16:26,000
Am I still in Montana?

291
00:16:26,035 --> 00:16:30,000
# Yea, Lord
I'm in the thick of it now #

292
00:16:30,035 --> 00:16:35,000
# Why, I said, Lord,
I'm in the thick of it now ##

293
00:16:35,035 --> 00:16:38,000
Everything's cable ready
and wired for the Internet:

294
00:16:38,035 --> 00:16:44,000
All this for $525 a month?

295
00:16:44,035 --> 00:16:46,000
- Is that too much?
- No.

296
00:16:46,035 --> 00:16:48,000
No. It's fine.

297
00:16:48,035 --> 00:16:51,000
But I'm not signing any long-term lease.
I'm only gonna be here a year at most.

298
00:16:51,035 --> 00:17:02,000
It's... no problem.

299
00:17:02,035 --> 00:17:06,000
I can't tell you how happy
we are that you're here, E:J:

300
00:17:06,035 --> 00:17:09,000
- Thank you, Mayor Baker.
- No, Bob, please.

301
00:17:09,035 --> 00:17:11,000
Bob.

302
00:17:11,035 --> 00:17:15,000
Let me introduce you to Jan Lucas.
This is E.J. Baxter.

303
00:17:15,035 --> 00:17:17,000
Anything you need, Jan will help.

304
00:17:17,035 --> 00:17:20,000
Great to meet you. We're so excited you're here.

305
00:17:20,035 --> 00:17:23,000
Oh! Oh!

306
00:17:23,035 --> 00:17:26,000
We didn't really get
a chance to talk specifics of what you expect.

307
00:17:26,035 --> 00:17:28,000
What would I know?

308
00:17:28,035 --> 00:17:33,000
I mean, you're the bigwig from New York:
I'm a mayor to 19,000 people:

309
00:17:33,035 --> 00:17:36,000
If I knew how to deaI
with what large companies were looking for...

310
00:17:36,035 --> 00:17:39,000
I wouldn't have brought you here
to do your magic.

311
00:17:39,035 --> 00:17:41,000
Settle in and get started...

312
00:17:41,035 --> 00:17:44,000
and we'll talk again later
after my zoning board meeting:

313
00:17:44,035 --> 00:17:47,000
- Oh, just two little things.
- Yeah. Shoot.

314
00:17:47,035 --> 00:17:48,000
Assistant and office.

315
00:17:52,035 --> 00:17:55,000
Oh. Well, um

316
00:17:55,035 --> 00:18:17,000
You and, uh

317
00:18:17,035 --> 00:18:18,000
Um, uh Uh

318
00:18:18,035 --> 00:18:20,000
- Jan.
- Jan! Jan.

319
00:18:20,035 --> 00:18:22,000
Sorry.

320
00:18:22,035 --> 00:18:24,000
Um, I'm putting together a brochure...

321
00:18:24,035 --> 00:18:28,000
with a list of things that corporate executives
didn't know they could do here...

322
00:18:28,035 --> 00:18:31,000
but I'm sure I must be missing something.

323
00:18:31,035 --> 00:18:34,000
Well, there's Glacier NationaI Park
and Flathead Lake.

324
00:18:34,035 --> 00:18:37,000
Yes, and those are wonderfuI,
but everybody already knows about them.

325
00:18:37,035 --> 00:18:40,000
I'm looking for something that
will really create a splash.

326
00:18:40,035 --> 00:18:44,000
I think people come here
wanting to experience...

327
00:18:44,035 --> 00:18:46,000
- what they don't have at home.
- Yes.

328
00:18:46,035 --> 00:18:51,000
Wilderness adventures,
rafting, fishing and hiking, and there's golf.

329
00:18:51,035 --> 00:18:54,000
Yes. Uh, let's see. How is your theater?

330
00:18:54,035 --> 00:18:56,000
Well, we're not exactly New York...

331
00:18:56,035 --> 00:19:00,000
but Ray Prince
does a great salute to Elvis.

332
00:19:00,035 --> 00:19:01,000
Wow.

333
00:19:01,035 --> 00:19:04,000
Um, how good are your museums?

334
00:19:04,035 --> 00:19:08,000
We don't have that many,
but the wildIife museum is really cooI.

335
00:19:08,035 --> 00:19:11,000
- And the HistoricaI Society puts on a
- You know what? Thank you.

336
00:19:11,035 --> 00:19:14,000
- I think I've got it. Thanks. That was a big help.
- Anytime.

337
00:19:14,035 --> 00:19:17,000
One night this week
we have to go out for drinks.

338
00:19:17,035 --> 00:19:20,000
We have the best bars and really great bands.

339
00:19:20,035 --> 00:19:24,000
Maybe. I'll just get myself settled.

340
00:19:24,035 --> 00:19:26,000
What are you doing a week from Sunday?

341
00:19:26,035 --> 00:19:30,000
Um, there's a barbecue to raise money
for the search and rescue station.

342
00:19:30,035 --> 00:19:34,000
I am working the bake sale
and I could really use some help.

343
00:19:34,035 --> 00:19:37,000
Absolutely. I am freedom's prisoner.

344
00:19:37,035 --> 00:19:48,000
Great.

345
00:19:58,035 --> 00:20:01,000
Give my best to Big Wayne.

346
00:20:01,035 --> 00:20:03,000
- Will.
- How you doing, Diane?

347
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:07,000
- I'm fine. But what's this I heard about your sister?
- Well, she moved to Tampa.

348
00:20:07,035 --> 00:20:10,000
She was moving in, coming down
the stairs, took a wrong turn, slipped.

349
00:20:10,035 --> 00:20:13,000
- Oh, no.
- Yeah, busted up her leg pretty good.

350
00:20:13,035 --> 00:20:17,000
Not a good thing.
Ligaments, tendons, bone. Not good.

351
00:20:17,035 --> 00:20:20,000
- How long is she gonna be in a cast?
- Like three months.

352
00:20:20,035 --> 00:20:23,000
And it's her right foot.
If it's your right foot, you can't drive.

353
00:20:23,035 --> 00:20:26,000
- Wow.
- People don't think about that.

354
00:20:26,035 --> 00:20:28,000
So my parents constantly have to go
over there, driving her around

355
00:20:28,035 --> 00:20:32,000
Excuse me. I am so sorry to hear about your
sister, but I need to pick up my package.

356
00:20:32,035 --> 00:20:34,000
- This was left at my door.
- You need to sign, hon.

357
00:20:34,035 --> 00:20:36,000
Oh. Sorry. Sorry.

358
00:20:36,035 --> 00:20:38,000
- Go. Go right ahead. I'm It's fine.
- Thank you.

359
00:20:38,035 --> 00:20:42,000
- I'm just used to doormen signing for me.
- Aren't we all?

360
00:20:42,035 --> 00:20:45,000
Well, now,
you're obviously really important.

361
00:20:45,035 --> 00:20:55,000
- So I'm gonna just I'll just wait.
- Thank you.

362
00:20:55,035 --> 00:20:59,000
So, what are your big Saturday night plans?

363
00:20:59,035 --> 00:21:02,000
Oh, you know.
We're having drinks at Joe Allen's.

364
00:21:02,035 --> 00:21:05,000
And then I have house seats
at the new Mamet play.

365
00:21:05,035 --> 00:21:08,000
Then we're going to this new place for dinner
by that former chef at Le Bernardin.

366
00:21:08,035 --> 00:21:10,000
- Me too.
- Really?

367
00:21:10,035 --> 00:21:13,000
Roz, have you forgotten
where I've been exiled to?

368
00:21:13,035 --> 00:21:16,000
Oh, I'm I'm sorry.

369
00:21:16,035 --> 00:21:18,000
Tell me about it.

370
00:21:18,035 --> 00:21:21,000
I- I promise you, first thing Monday morning
I will send you a care package.

371
00:21:21,035 --> 00:21:25,000
And now in national news,
two snowboarders were buried today:::

372
00:21:25,035 --> 00:21:30,000
when a sudden avalanche hit
Glacier NationaI Park in Northwestern Montana.

373
00:21:30,035 --> 00:21:32,000
- The area is popular:::
- Hey, quick. Turn on C.N.B.

374
00:21:32,035 --> 00:21:35,000
with thrill-seekers looking for clean,
untouched powder:

375
00:21:35,035 --> 00:21:37,000
Center officials estimated that the avalanche...

376
00:21:37,035 --> 00:21:41,000
- was between 400 and 500 feet:
- I see it.

377
00:21:41,035 --> 00:21:44,000
Search and rescue workers risked icy winds
and perilous conditions...

378
00:21:44,035 --> 00:21:46,000
to locate the stranded athletes.

379
00:21:46,035 --> 00:21:50,000
Our C.N.B. reporter spoke by phone
with squad physician Marci HempeI.

380
00:21:50,035 --> 00:21:54,000
By the time we found them,
the men were suffering from hypothermia:

381
00:21:54,035 --> 00:21:58,000
We airlifted them to Kalispell RegionaI and
we do expect them to make a full recovery.

382
00:21:58,035 --> 00:22:03,000
But had we arrived even a few minutes later,
they might not have survived:

383
00:22:03,035 --> 00:22:07,000
- Honey, is that anywhere near you?
- I think so.

384
00:22:09,035 --> 00:22:12,000
I got it! I got it!

385
00:22:12,035 --> 00:22:16,000
Nice play!

386
00:22:16,035 --> 00:22:24,000
Yeah!

387
00:22:24,035 --> 00:22:28,000
- Just what I was hoping for:
- Here you go. Thank you.

388
00:22:28,035 --> 00:22:30,000
Thanks, Marci.

389
00:22:30,035 --> 00:22:33,000
- Hi.
- Hi, Eric.

390
00:22:33,035 --> 00:22:37,000
- Um, how much for one of these cupcakes?
- Uh, a dollar.

391
00:22:37,035 --> 00:22:40,000
But after what you and the rescue squad
went through yesterday, it's on me.

392
00:22:40,035 --> 00:22:43,000
Well, thank you.

393
00:22:43,035 --> 00:22:45,000
- Eric, this is E.J. Baxter.
- Oh, hi.

394
00:22:45,035 --> 00:22:48,000
- She just moved here from New York:
- Wow, New York.

395
00:22:48,035 --> 00:22:50,000
- Must be a big adjustment, huh?
- Yeah.

396
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:52,000
You could say that.

397
00:22:52,035 --> 00:22:56,000
- Um, so you were involved in that rescue yesterday?
- Yeah. Yeah, I was.

398
00:22:56,035 --> 00:22:59,000
- That was something.
- You're being modest. You guys were fantastic.

399
00:22:59,035 --> 00:23:03,000
We were lucky. We've been borrowing our
helicopter from Sam Simon.

400
00:23:03,035 --> 00:23:05,000
Only he sold his place and is moving to Aspen.

401
00:23:05,035 --> 00:23:08,000
So I don't know what we're gonna do
when that happens.

402
00:23:08,035 --> 00:23:10,000
Anyway, um, thanks for the cupcake.

403
00:23:10,035 --> 00:23:14,000
- It was nice to meet you, E.J.
- You, too.

404
00:23:14,035 --> 00:23:18,000
Marci, why doesn't the search and
rescue squad have its own helicopter?

405
00:23:18,035 --> 00:23:22,000
We're funded through the county.
These days we're lucky to get what we get.

406
00:23:22,035 --> 00:23:25,000
It doesn't even begin to pay for repairs,
training, new equipment:

407
00:23:25,035 --> 00:23:28,000
- Not even close.
- I really admire you guys.

408
00:23:28,035 --> 00:23:31,000
- I could never do what you do, no matter how much I got paid.
- Oh, we don't get paid.

409
00:23:31,035 --> 00:23:33,000
It's all volunteer.

410
00:23:33,035 --> 00:23:37,000
Exactly. For instance,
Marci's husband Dave is a reaI estate agent.

411
00:23:37,035 --> 00:23:41,000
- But he's also on rescue squad:
- Then why risk your lives?

412
00:23:41,035 --> 00:24:02,000
'Cause we love it here. Because it's important.

413
00:24:02,035 --> 00:24:05,000
- I got, like, seven of these cups now.
- Can I borrow one?

414
00:24:05,035 --> 00:24:08,000
- Will you look at that?
- Oh, yeah:

415
00:24:08,035 --> 00:24:12,000
That's E.J. Baxter.
Jan just introduced me to her.

416
00:24:12,035 --> 00:24:15,000
- She just moved here from New York:
- Oh, we've met:

417
00:24:17,035 --> 00:24:20,000
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

418
00:24:20,035 --> 00:24:22,000
Mm-hmm. Hmm.

419
00:24:22,035 --> 00:24:24,000
So, this is how you raise money.

420
00:24:24,035 --> 00:24:26,000
Hey, we do it however we can.

421
00:24:26,035 --> 00:24:30,000
We sponsor triathlons
and pancake breakfasts and raffles.

422
00:24:30,035 --> 00:24:35,000
- And then there's
- I'm guessing people here really get into eating carbs.

423
00:24:35,035 --> 00:24:36,000
Yeah. They passed a law.

424
00:24:41,035 --> 00:24:45,000
I don't know who that guy is over there,
but he certainly has a high opinion of himself.

425
00:24:45,035 --> 00:24:47,000
That's Will Albrecht:

426
00:24:47,035 --> 00:24:51,000
- He's the George Clooney of Kalispell.
- Mm-hmm.

427
00:24:51,035 --> 00:25:04,000
Oh, please. In New York,
he couldn't bribe his way past the velvet ropes.

428
00:25:04,035 --> 00:25:05,000
Sighs ]

429
00:25:05,035 --> 00:25:08,000
Was that a good sigh or a bad sigh?

430
00:25:08,035 --> 00:25:11,000
] Why does
every road in this state look exactly the same?

431
00:25:11,035 --> 00:25:15,000
If only I could just hail a cab to this place:

432
00:25:15,035 --> 00:25:17,000
Ah, yes:
The comforts of home:

433
00:25:17,035 --> 00:25:20,000
] Oh, speaking of which,
can you do me a favor:::

434
00:25:20,035 --> 00:25:23,000
and send me a 10-pound bag
of Fairways bold blend coffee?

435
00:25:23,035 --> 00:25:26,000
They don't have coffee in Montana?

436
00:25:26,035 --> 00:25:28,000
Yes, but I miss Fairway.

437
00:25:28,035 --> 00:25:32,000
And now I have to blend my own because the
nearest Starbucks in this town is 10 miles away.

438
00:25:32,035 --> 00:25:35,000
- Throwing my whole morning off.
- Where are you? You're breaking up.

439
00:25:35,035 --> 00:25:38,000
My old client, Robert Lazarre, owns this chalet.

440
00:25:38,035 --> 00:25:41,000
I got him to let me rent it
for C.E.O.s or corporate events.

441
00:25:41,035 --> 00:25:44,000
Just need some great pictures
in order to entice them.

442
00:25:44,035 --> 00:25:46,000
Oh. You should see this place.

443
00:25:46,035 --> 00:25:49,000
- Is it dripping with macrame?
- Snob:

444
00:25:49,035 --> 00:25:52,000
- Pot calls kettle.
- It really is incredible.

445
00:25:52,035 --> 00:26:08,000
It's like the Montana version of Hearst Castle.

446
00:26:17,035 --> 00:26:19,000
- Oh: You again:
- Can I help you?

447
00:26:19,035 --> 00:26:22,000
You do realize this is a private residence?

448
00:26:22,035 --> 00:26:26,000
Yeah. I'm aware of that.

449
00:26:26,035 --> 00:26:27,000
You're not Robert Lazarre.

450
00:26:27,035 --> 00:26:31,000
Not the last time I checked, no.

451
00:26:31,035 --> 00:26:34,000
- He lets me use it whenever he's out of town.
- Oh, I see.

452
00:26:34,035 --> 00:26:38,000
I just came to check it out.

453
00:26:38,035 --> 00:26:40,000
Are you enjoying the view?

454
00:26:40,035 --> 00:26:45,000
Let's just say Montana's
not all it's cracked up to be.

455
00:26:45,035 --> 00:26:47,000
It'll grow on you.

456
00:26:47,035 --> 00:26:50,000
Don't count on it.

457
00:26:50,035 --> 00:26:53,000
I'm gonna go inside and go photograph
the inside of the house.

458
00:26:53,035 --> 00:26:55,000
- Don't leave on my account.
- I'm not.

459
00:26:55,035 --> 00:26:57,000
I believe I got what I came for.

460
00:26:57,035 --> 00:26:59,000
Oh. Well, I'm flattered.

461
00:26:59,035 --> 00:27:01,000
Don't be.

462
00:27:01,035 --> 00:27:03,000
Did you find your way up the mountain okay?

463
00:27:03,035 --> 00:27:07,000
Or did you need
roadside assistance to escort you?

464
00:27:07,035 --> 00:27:10,000
Your reputation precedes you,
Ms. Baxter.

465
00:27:10,035 --> 00:27:13,000
Better to have one than be invisible, Mr.

466
00:27:13,035 --> 00:27:17,000
Oh, Albrecht. Will Albrecht.

467
00:27:17,035 --> 00:27:21,000
You have a nice day, Mr. Albrecht.

468
00:27:25,035 --> 00:27:28,000
I cannot believe you said that to Will.

469
00:27:28,035 --> 00:27:30,000
What did he say?

470
00:27:30,035 --> 00:27:33,000
I'm sure he's still trying to come up with a clever
comeback, but I can assure you he blushed.

471
00:27:33,035 --> 00:27:35,000
All of him.

472
00:27:35,035 --> 00:27:37,000
Did you get lost?

473
00:27:37,035 --> 00:27:42,000
Now, why would you ask me that?

474
00:27:42,035 --> 00:27:44,000
- Hey, Eric.
- Hey, Jan.

475
00:27:44,035 --> 00:27:46,000
- Hey, E.J.
- Hey.

476
00:27:46,035 --> 00:27:49,000
Uh, we had some extra
Kalispell calendars down at the bank.

477
00:27:49,035 --> 00:27:53,000
I thought before we trashed them, maybe you
could use them here at the tourist board.

478
00:27:53,035 --> 00:27:56,000
- Sure.
- Great.

479
00:27:56,035 --> 00:28:01,000
So, E.J., uh, how are you settling in?

480
00:28:01,035 --> 00:28:02,000
If there's anything you need...

481
00:28:02,035 --> 00:28:04,000
you know, moving stuff or whatnot

482
00:28:04,035 --> 00:28:07,000
Thank you. You're all so friendly here.

483
00:28:07,035 --> 00:28:10,000
Do you all know each other,
or are you just members of the same cult?

484
00:28:10,035 --> 00:28:13,000
No. We We just try to be nice.

485
00:28:13,035 --> 00:28:14,000
Weird.

486
00:28:14,035 --> 00:28:18,000
I'm taking E.J. out for drinks later on.
Maybe you'd like to join us.

487
00:28:18,035 --> 00:28:20,000
I would. Oh.

488
00:28:20,035 --> 00:28:23,000
I mean, I would, but we got a squad meeting
down at the rescue station.

489
00:28:23,035 --> 00:28:26,000
No biggie. We'll do it another time.

490
00:28:26,035 --> 00:28:32,000
Yeah. Absolutely. Another time.

491
00:28:32,035 --> 00:28:35,000
- Thanks for the calendars.
- Oh, right. Yeah.

492
00:28:35,035 --> 00:28:39,000
So, have a great day.

493
00:28:39,035 --> 00:28:44,000
- Bye.
- Bye.

494
00:28:47,035 --> 00:28:50,000
So, what's going on between you two?

495
00:28:50,035 --> 00:28:55,000
Oh, we've been doing this protracted
dance around each other for months.

496
00:28:55,035 --> 00:28:59,000
Every time he takes two steps closer to me,
he freaks and steps away.

497
00:28:59,035 --> 00:29:02,000
Yeah.
Exactly what I want to hang on my wall.

498
00:29:02,035 --> 00:29:04,000
Scenery I look at every day.

499
00:29:04,035 --> 00:29:07,000
- I'm sure you'd rather be looking at him.
- Wouldn't you?

500
00:29:07,035 --> 00:29:10,000
Who wouldn't?

501
00:29:10,035 --> 00:29:16,000
Well, I hope you're up
for getting liquored up tonight, because I am.

502
00:29:16,035 --> 00:29:19,000
Jan?

503
00:29:19,035 --> 00:29:27,000
Plans have just changed.
We have someplace else we need to be.

504
00:29:27,035 --> 00:29:30,000
Uh, excuse me:

505
00:29:30,035 --> 00:29:32,000
- Did you say naked?
- You mean totally?

506
00:29:32,035 --> 00:29:35,000
That's the basic idea of a naked calendar.

507
00:29:35,035 --> 00:29:37,000
I'm sorry. Does someone have a cold?

508
00:29:37,035 --> 00:29:39,000
No, um, but someone
needs her head examined...

509
00:29:39,035 --> 00:29:42,000
if she thinks resorting
to cheap gimmicks is a good idea.

510
00:29:42,035 --> 00:29:46,000
Okay, guys: Hear me out:

511
00:29:46,035 --> 00:29:51,000
Now, in the past your fund-raising efforts
haven't really shown your true assets.

512
00:29:51,035 --> 00:29:53,000
- Which are?
- You men.

513
00:29:53,035 --> 00:29:56,000
You're great at what you do:

514
00:29:56,035 --> 00:29:59,000
But you need new and updated equipment
in order to do your job:

515
00:29:59,035 --> 00:30:02,000
What's going to happen if and when
there's another avalanche?

516
00:30:02,035 --> 00:30:06,000
She's got a point. If tourists are worried for
their safety, they'll go to Idaho, or Aspen.

517
00:30:06,035 --> 00:30:09,000
- Thank you:
- I don't think I'm gonna pose in my birthday suit.

518
00:30:09,035 --> 00:30:13,000
I haven't been in a bathing suit since
I was, like, 22 or so.

519
00:30:13,035 --> 00:30:17,000
Think of this as more sexy than naked, David.

520
00:30:17,035 --> 00:30:20,000
But with humor,
and in good taste, of course:

521
00:30:20,035 --> 00:30:22,000
I don't want my kids to see this.

522
00:30:22,035 --> 00:30:24,000
No one is actually going to see anything.

523
00:30:24,035 --> 00:30:27,000
- You'll have things to cover up.
- Cover what?

524
00:30:27,035 --> 00:30:30,000
Certain... body parts.

525
00:30:30,035 --> 00:30:33,000
No, I think he means what kind of things.

526
00:30:33,035 --> 00:30:36,000
Oh: Sorry: Uh, tools of your trade:

527
00:30:36,035 --> 00:30:39,000
Like the ax and the snowblower.
Helmets.

528
00:30:42,035 --> 00:30:45,000
Okay: Okay, it's funny:

529
00:30:45,035 --> 00:30:47,000
But here I have a detailed breakdown...

530
00:30:47,035 --> 00:30:50,000
of other calendars similar to the ones
I'm talking about...

531
00:30:50,035 --> 00:30:53,000
and what they've earned
over the past three years.

532
00:30:53,035 --> 00:30:56,000
Exactly. It's a tired idea.

533
00:30:56,035 --> 00:31:00,000
Between calendar sales, corporate
sponsorship and extra cash from the publicity:::

534
00:31:00,035 --> 00:31:02,000
you'll see the difference between what
you've already raised and what you need.

535
00:31:02,035 --> 00:31:05,000
That's if it sells out.

536
00:31:05,035 --> 00:31:10,000
In any case, it's better than the $112
you've made from selling cupcakes.

537
00:31:10,035 --> 00:31:12,000
Hey, look. I I get this. I do.

538
00:31:12,035 --> 00:31:14,000
I'm just, um
I'm afraid about losing customers.

539
00:31:14,035 --> 00:31:16,000
Ah. That's where you're wrong, Les.

540
00:31:16,035 --> 00:31:20,000
- You own the kitchen design store, right?
- Yeah.

541
00:31:20,035 --> 00:31:22,000
That means the majority
of your customers are women.

542
00:31:22,035 --> 00:31:26,000
So when it comes time for them
to resurface their cabinets:::

543
00:31:26,035 --> 00:31:29,000
they'll think of the hot search and rescue guy
hanging on their wall.

544
00:31:29,035 --> 00:31:33,000
Okay, guys, guys, listen:
It's been done a million times:

545
00:31:33,035 --> 00:31:35,000
And when no one buys it, I guarantee you

546
00:31:35,035 --> 00:31:38,000
This idea isn't about you, Will.

547
00:31:38,035 --> 00:31:41,000
Hey, don't you think some of us
are past our sell-by date?

548
00:31:41,035 --> 00:31:44,000
Dave's right: I mean, who's gonna want
to buy a picture of him?

549
00:31:44,035 --> 00:31:48,000
You know what? You're reaI men.

550
00:31:48,035 --> 00:31:52,000
And there's nothing more appealing and sexy
than a man who's comfortable

551
00:31:52,035 --> 00:31:55,000
In his own skin.

552
00:31:55,035 --> 00:31:57,000
Exactly.

553
00:31:57,035 --> 00:31:59,000
Exactly:

554
00:31:59,035 --> 00:32:02,000
Now, I realize this idea
is slightly unconventionaI.

555
00:32:02,035 --> 00:32:05,000
But you guys need to raise a lot of money.

556
00:32:05,035 --> 00:32:07,000
And yes, you don't know me yet.

557
00:32:07,035 --> 00:32:10,000
But I'm asking each and every one of you
to take a leap of faith.

558
00:32:10,035 --> 00:32:15,000
When I moved here, I realized that this station
was at the core of Kalispell:

559
00:32:15,035 --> 00:32:19,000
Every family has been touched by it
and depends on you:

560
00:32:19,035 --> 00:32:22,000
You're right to be proud of what you do.

561
00:32:22,035 --> 00:32:30,000
So I hope you all will do whatever it takes to
get the rescue station you so deserve.

562
00:32:30,035 --> 00:32:34,000
I've heard people from New York don't like to
get touchy-feely, but you are awesome, E.J.

563
00:32:34,035 --> 00:32:37,000
We really needed someone
like you to kick some butt.

564
00:32:37,035 --> 00:32:40,000
Thank you.

565
00:32:40,035 --> 00:32:42,000
Oh, good morning, Mr. Albrecht.

566
00:32:42,035 --> 00:32:45,000
- Can I get you some coffee?
- Uh, no, thank you.

567
00:32:45,035 --> 00:32:48,000
- I just came by to tell you
- I'm glad you did.

568
00:32:48,035 --> 00:32:51,000
I don't think we should waste any more time.
I realized before I left

569
00:32:51,035 --> 00:32:53,000
The squad voted no.

570
00:32:53,035 --> 00:32:55,000
But, uh, thank you for thinking of us:

571
00:32:55,035 --> 00:32:58,000
- What do you mean, no?
- Well, we are funded through the county's

572
00:32:58,035 --> 00:33:00,000
In this economy, you're going to be waiting
a long time before you

573
00:33:00,035 --> 00:33:03,000
I know that, which is why we supplement
our fund-raising with

574
00:33:03,035 --> 00:33:05,000
Pancake breakfasts? Bake sales?

575
00:33:05,035 --> 00:33:12,000
Even if the entire state of Montana had a
bake sale, you still wouldn't raise enough to

576
00:33:12,035 --> 00:33:14,000
I'm sorry. Don't you want new equipment?

577
00:33:14,035 --> 00:33:18,000
What I don't want is to make
a joke of the rescue squad.

578
00:33:18,035 --> 00:33:21,000
Well, then explain something to me,
because I'm obviously missing something.

579
00:33:21,035 --> 00:33:23,000
Yes, obviously.

580
00:33:23,035 --> 00:33:27,000
So you don't mind being naked,
but you won't pose, even partially covered...

581
00:33:27,035 --> 00:33:29,000
to raise money for something
you profess to believe in?

582
00:33:29,035 --> 00:33:32,000
Why is this so important to you?

583
00:33:32,035 --> 00:33:35,000
I was brought here to lure corporate retreats.

584
00:33:35,035 --> 00:33:38,000
People aren't going to spend money
where they don't feeI safe.

585
00:33:38,035 --> 00:33:41,000
Oh, so you're doing all this
for purely altruistic reasons...

586
00:33:41,035 --> 00:33:45,000
to help people you'll never see or think about
again as soon as you can get out of here:::

587
00:33:45,035 --> 00:33:47,000
with no thought whatsoever
how this can benefit your own career.

588
00:33:47,035 --> 00:33:51,000
That is so unfair on so many levels. You're
saying it's bad if I look good?

589
00:33:51,035 --> 00:33:54,000
Shh.

590
00:33:54,035 --> 00:33:57,000
People will hear you.

591
00:33:57,035 --> 00:34:01,000
You might get knocked off your pedestaI.

592
00:34:04,035 --> 00:34:07,000
That man oughta be locked up.

593
00:34:07,035 --> 00:34:12,000
That's just Will. He's always happiest when he's
got something to be angry about.

594
00:34:12,035 --> 00:34:14,000
- He's really great when you get to know him.
- Yeah?

595
00:34:14,035 --> 00:34:18,000
Well, they said even Hitler was charming
when he was courting Eva Braun.

596
00:34:18,035 --> 00:34:20,000
Ugh.

597
00:34:20,035 --> 00:34:22,000
Sighs ]

598
00:34:22,035 --> 00:34:26,000
You know, there are 13 men
on the rescue squad and only 12 months.

599
00:34:26,035 --> 00:34:28,000
I don't even need him to pose.

600
00:34:28,035 --> 00:34:33,000
- Maybe you should just forget about the whole thing.
- Now, why would I do that?

601
00:34:33,035 --> 00:34:36,000
I don't want you to be disappointed
if it doesn't happen.

602
00:34:36,035 --> 00:34:39,000
Oh, it's going to happen.
It just hasn't happened yet.

603
00:34:39,035 --> 00:34:42,000
You're always saying E.J. is the expert, Bob.

604
00:34:42,035 --> 00:34:47,000
If someone is willing to pay to see you
without your clothes on, I say go for it.

605
00:34:47,035 --> 00:34:50,000
But, Bonnie, I have a position to uphold.

606
00:34:50,035 --> 00:34:53,000
Will people still respect me if I pose?

607
00:34:53,035 --> 00:34:57,000
I can assure you, Mayor Bob,
you will not lose your dignity.

608
00:34:57,035 --> 00:35:01,000
He has dignity?

609
00:35:01,035 --> 00:35:04,000
I can't believe you convinced Mayor Bob:

610
00:35:04,035 --> 00:35:08,000
Well, he finally realized I'm a pit bull
and I wasn't gonna let it go untiI he gave in.

611
00:35:08,035 --> 00:35:11,000
Jan, seven down, five to go.

612
00:35:11,035 --> 00:35:13,000
You're right. It affects us all.

613
00:35:13,035 --> 00:35:15,000
I would do it, but it would upset Laura.

614
00:35:15,035 --> 00:35:18,000
Laura, you're not looking at the big picture.

615
00:35:18,035 --> 00:35:22,000
No, I get it.
You're doing this so you can hit on Rick.

616
00:35:22,035 --> 00:35:24,000
No, I'm not. I'm envious.

617
00:35:24,035 --> 00:35:30,000
You're so lucky you have a husband who
puts your feelings above everybody else.

618
00:35:30,035 --> 00:35:33,000
The rescue boat does need patching.

619
00:35:33,035 --> 00:35:35,000
E.J., you did not have to do this.

620
00:35:35,035 --> 00:35:37,000
Well, it's my way of saying thank you, Henry.

621
00:35:37,035 --> 00:35:40,000
- I would've never gotten Rick without your help.
- Thank you. I appreciate it.

622
00:35:40,035 --> 00:35:43,000
- Just don't eat too many before the shoot.
- Yeah.

623
00:35:43,035 --> 00:35:48,000
As far as Andy and Jim, they're brothers, so
I was thinking of taking them to dinner and

624
00:35:48,035 --> 00:35:49,000
- Together?
- Yes.

625
00:35:49,035 --> 00:35:51,000
Trust me. You do not want to do that.

626
00:35:51,035 --> 00:35:54,000
- Why don't I?
- Because they're not gonna listen.

627
00:35:54,035 --> 00:35:57,000
They're gonna spend the whole time trying to
see which one's gonna get the waitress's number.

628
00:35:57,035 --> 00:36:00,000
- Have they always been like that?
- Ever since Little League.

629
00:36:00,035 --> 00:36:02,000
When they were on the same team,
they would strike out every time.

630
00:36:02,035 --> 00:36:06,000
But when they were playing against each other,
suddenly they were hitting grand slams.

631
00:36:06,035 --> 00:36:08,000
I think I can work with that.

632
00:36:08,035 --> 00:36:12,000
- But in case they won't pose, you could arrest them.
- I can't do that.

633
00:36:12,035 --> 00:36:14,000
- Club them into submission? Stun gun?
- Sorry. Not gonna happen.

634
00:36:14,035 --> 00:36:16,000
Yeah, well, it was worth a shot.

635
00:36:18,035 --> 00:36:21,000
- It's not happening, E.J.
- Okay. No biggie, Jim.

636
00:36:21,035 --> 00:36:23,000
I guess it'll just be Andy.

637
00:36:23,035 --> 00:36:26,000
It's not happening, E.J.
There's lots of other guys who'll do it.

638
00:36:26,035 --> 00:36:32,000
I know. It's just that I would be offending you
if I asked Jim to pose and not you.

639
00:36:32,035 --> 00:36:35,000
I know my brother,
and there's no way he's posing.

640
00:36:35,035 --> 00:36:38,000
I'm not posing, E.J., and Andy won't if I won't.

641
00:36:38,035 --> 00:36:41,000
- Too late, Jim.
- What? Andy said yes?

642
00:36:41,035 --> 00:36:47,000
Jim said yes?

643
00:36:47,035 --> 00:36:52,000
E.J., I can't believe what a stink this calendar
is creating around here.

644
00:36:52,035 --> 00:36:54,000
- I say good for you.
- That's sweet.

645
00:36:54,035 --> 00:36:57,000
Thanks, Diane.

646
00:37:05,035 --> 00:37:08,000
- Well, Miss Baxter.
- Mr. Albrecht.

647
00:37:08,035 --> 00:37:10,000
How about that?
We actually have something in common.

648
00:37:10,035 --> 00:37:13,000
We both go to the post office
on Saturdays.

649
00:37:13,035 --> 00:37:15,000
Hmm. I imagine a lot of people do.

650
00:37:15,035 --> 00:37:18,000
I'm sure you're right. Enjoying your day?

651
00:37:18,035 --> 00:37:20,000
- Mmm. Just doing errands.
- Me too.

652
00:37:20,035 --> 00:37:24,000
You'll be surprised to know
that I haven't gotten lost once yet today.

653
00:37:24,035 --> 00:37:28,000
Well, it's not even noon yet, so

654
00:37:28,035 --> 00:37:30,000
Yeah, Saturday mornings
are all about errands for me.

655
00:37:30,035 --> 00:37:33,000
But then I always head to
this little brunch place down the block.

656
00:37:33,035 --> 00:37:36,000
- Nice.
- Yeah.

657
00:37:36,035 --> 00:37:39,000
- It's reaI nice. It's got great food.
- Mmm. You enjoy yourself.

658
00:37:39,035 --> 00:37:42,000
Oh, do you know where the nearest Kinko's is?

659
00:37:42,035 --> 00:37:46,000
I never had a need to look before,
but since that calendar is actually happening...

660
00:37:46,035 --> 00:37:48,000
Jan and I can't do all the copying
by ourselves, so

661
00:37:48,035 --> 00:37:50,000
- We don't have a Kinko's.
- No Kinko's?

662
00:37:50,035 --> 00:37:52,000
No Kinko's.

663
00:37:52,035 --> 00:37:54,000
How can that be?

664
00:37:54,035 --> 00:37:57,000
I thought there was a law that said there had to
be a Kinko's on every corner next to a Gap.

665
00:37:57,035 --> 00:38:01,000
- We don't have a Gap either.
- That's not even funny.

666
00:38:01,035 --> 00:38:03,000
But I think there's one in Billings.

667
00:38:03,035 --> 00:38:06,000
I don't know what that is,
but I need to go there. How close is it?

668
00:38:06,035 --> 00:38:11,000
Oh, it's not too bad. About 10 hours,
depending on the road conditions.

669
00:38:11,035 --> 00:38:13,000
Ain't it awfuI?

670
00:38:13,035 --> 00:38:18,000
- I'm not gonna be here forever, so don't worry.
- I'll try not to sweat it.

671
00:38:18,035 --> 00:38:23,000
Just because I have a different way of doing
things doesn't make it wrong, just different.

672
00:38:23,035 --> 00:38:25,000
I get that you don't think I belong here...

673
00:38:25,035 --> 00:38:28,000
and you have zero respect
for what I'm trying to do.

674
00:38:28,035 --> 00:38:31,000
But you know what?
I don't care. Not even remotely.

675
00:38:31,035 --> 00:38:34,000
And I get that you think I act
like I've landed on the moon.

676
00:38:34,035 --> 00:38:36,000
And you know what?
You don't have to tell me that.

677
00:38:36,035 --> 00:38:39,000
Because for the past six months,
I've felt like I've been living on another planet.

678
00:38:39,035 --> 00:38:42,000
So for the future, let's be polite...

679
00:38:42,035 --> 00:38:47,000
and agree we disagree
and leave it at that, shall we?

680
00:38:47,035 --> 00:38:48,000
Henry:

681
00:38:48,035 --> 00:38:51,000
- Hey there, E.J.
- Hey. You're always so helpfuI.

682
00:38:51,035 --> 00:38:55,000
- Can you tell me where to get copies made in this town?
- There's a place on Railway.

683
00:38:55,035 --> 00:39:09,000
- And that's that way?
- Let me show you.

684
00:39:09,035 --> 00:39:11,000
Very good. Elbow low and close.

685
00:39:11,035 --> 00:39:13,000
It's all about
the naturaI flex of the rod.

686
00:39:13,035 --> 00:39:15,000
I guess the fish aren't in a biting mood.

687
00:39:15,035 --> 00:39:19,000
Otherwise your basket
would be totally full by now.

688
00:39:19,035 --> 00:39:21,000
- Uh-huh.
- Jason, I'm serious.

689
00:39:21,035 --> 00:39:23,000
Deep down, I'm a reaI outdoorsy kind of girI.

690
00:39:23,035 --> 00:39:29,000
You didn't
have to sign up for a lesson to get me to pose.

691
00:39:29,035 --> 00:39:32,000
I just wanted to say thank you for your support.

692
00:39:32,035 --> 00:39:34,000
I know it was you who tried
to convince the guys.

693
00:39:34,035 --> 00:39:36,000
I don't know what the big deaI is.

694
00:39:36,035 --> 00:39:40,000
I'm for any good excuse to display the wares.

695
00:39:40,035 --> 00:39:41,000
Whoa!

696
00:39:41,035 --> 00:39:44,000
I got one! I got one!

697
00:39:44,035 --> 00:39:48,000
No! I'm gonna land this sucker!
I'm gonna land this sucker!

698
00:39:48,035 --> 00:39:51,000
- Whoo! I got it!
- ReeI it in there! ReeI it in!

699
00:39:51,035 --> 00:39:53,000
You know what gets me?

700
00:39:53,035 --> 00:39:56,000
People who have no problem
with graphic violence...

701
00:39:56,035 --> 00:39:59,000
but are horrified by the slightest display
of the human body.

702
00:39:59,035 --> 00:40:03,000
- No wonder the rest of the world thinks we're nuts.
- Mmm.

703
00:40:03,035 --> 00:40:05,000
]
Speaking of the disapprovers:

704
00:40:05,035 --> 00:40:08,000
Ah: Will:

705
00:40:08,035 --> 00:40:10,000
He's a piece of work.

706
00:40:10,035 --> 00:40:13,000
You know, the thing is,
we used to be best friends.

707
00:40:13,035 --> 00:40:15,000
We practically grew up together.

708
00:40:15,035 --> 00:40:17,000
And then when his sporting goods stores
became successfuI...

709
00:40:17,035 --> 00:40:20,000
he had a chance to help me
get the job I really wanted.

710
00:40:20,035 --> 00:40:23,000
- But instead, he made sure they didn't hire me.
- Why?

711
00:40:23,035 --> 00:40:28,000
Will's all about Will.
Always has been, always will be.

712
00:40:28,035 --> 00:40:32,000
- He dumped his fiancee the morning of their wedding.
- Shut up.

713
00:40:32,035 --> 00:40:34,000
Oh, yeah.

714
00:40:34,035 --> 00:40:37,000
No one really knows what happened,
but it was bad enough she left town first thing.

715
00:40:37,035 --> 00:40:39,000
Well, she's better off.

716
00:40:39,035 --> 00:40:41,000
The point is, life is too short.

717
00:40:41,035 --> 00:40:44,000
Now, I don't let Will screw up my happiness.
Neither should you.

718
00:40:47,035 --> 00:40:49,000
Marcus running with a pass down low!

719
00:40:49,035 --> 00:40:51,000
Yeah! Now we're cookin'!

720
00:40:51,035 --> 00:40:53,000
- Hey, E.J.
- Eric.

721
00:40:53,035 --> 00:40:57,000
- I've been looking for you. Can we talk for a second?
- Sure.

722
00:40:57,035 --> 00:40:59,000
What do you know about the Grizzlies?

723
00:40:59,035 --> 00:41:02,000
I really had no idea there was
such a big bear problem up here.

724
00:41:02,035 --> 00:41:05,000
- I meant the team.
- Oh, I knew that. Football.

725
00:41:05,035 --> 00:41:07,000
- Basketball.
- I meant basketball.

726
00:41:07,035 --> 00:41:10,000
- And football.
- Okay, you know what? Ignore him, E.J.

727
00:41:10,035 --> 00:41:13,000
- All the U. M. teams here are called the Grizzlies.
- Thank you.

728
00:41:13,035 --> 00:41:15,000
- You want a drink?
- Sure.

729
00:41:15,035 --> 00:41:17,000
It's on my tab.

730
00:41:17,035 --> 00:41:19,000
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

731
00:41:19,035 --> 00:41:23,000
- Now leave.
- Well, that's not very neighborly of you.

732
00:41:23,035 --> 00:41:27,000
What? Do you want to be alone with Eric?

733
00:41:27,035 --> 00:41:30,000
- Are you two on a date?
- What are you, 12?

734
00:41:30,035 --> 00:41:34,000
You know what? You should stay here,
because when I tell Eric about your

735
00:41:34,035 --> 00:41:36,000
How shall I put it? Shortcomings.

736
00:41:36,035 --> 00:41:39,000
I bet he won't think twice about posing.

737
00:41:39,035 --> 00:41:42,000
- Really?
- Mm-hmm. Saw it with my own green eyes.

738
00:41:42,035 --> 00:41:45,000
- Have you asked Dr. Mike to pose yet?
- He said yes.

739
00:41:45,035 --> 00:41:48,000
Well, while you were there,
did you get your eyes checked?

740
00:41:48,035 --> 00:41:52,000
Because you obviously have
a depth perception problem.

741
00:41:52,035 --> 00:41:53,000
There you go.

742
00:41:53,035 --> 00:41:55,000
- What did I miss?
- Nothing.

743
00:41:55,035 --> 00:41:57,000
- Not a thing.
- Mm-mmm.

744
00:41:57,035 --> 00:42:00,000
Whoa. Red rover, red rover.

745
00:42:00,035 --> 00:42:04,000
- Well, here's to that.
- I know. Cheers!

746
00:42:04,035 --> 00:42:05,000
Hey, ladies.

747
00:42:05,035 --> 00:42:08,000
Ugh! Is he always such a pig?

748
00:42:08,035 --> 00:42:11,000
Hey. He wouldn't be my best friend
since sixth grade if he was.

749
00:42:11,035 --> 00:42:13,000
Well, you're not in sixth grade anymore.

750
00:42:13,035 --> 00:42:16,000
Eric, if you pose,
this calendar becomes a reality...

751
00:42:16,035 --> 00:42:21,000
and the station will get everything that they

752
00:42:21,035 --> 00:42:23,000
What is that?

753
00:42:23,035 --> 00:42:25,000
- It's a powder hound.
- What? Um

754
00:42:25,035 --> 00:42:28,000
- No?
- No, I-I

755
00:42:28,035 --> 00:42:31,000
Excuse me. Could I please get a Lillet
on the rocks, please?

756
00:42:31,035 --> 00:42:34,000
- A what?
- Oh, just make it a scotch, anything.

757
00:42:34,035 --> 00:42:36,000
You ever heard of it?

758
00:42:36,035 --> 00:42:40,000
Look, I-I know why this is important, E.J.,
and it isn't about Will.

759
00:42:40,035 --> 00:42:43,000
I just I can't.
I mean, I hate getting my picture taken.

760
00:42:43,035 --> 00:42:45,000
But you're so adorable.

761
00:42:45,035 --> 00:42:48,000
I bet your mother has pictures of you
hanging up all over her house.

762
00:42:48,035 --> 00:42:51,000
Oh, no. My My parents are very religious.

763
00:42:51,035 --> 00:42:53,000
- I could never let them see it.
- Mmm, I see.

764
00:42:53,035 --> 00:42:58,000
Eric, when they write your
obituary why wouldn't you want them to say...

765
00:42:58,035 --> 00:43:00,000
amongst all the other good things...

766
00:43:00,035 --> 00:43:08,000
that you did this charitable thing
for your entire community?

767
00:43:08,035 --> 00:43:12,000
You know what? That That might be
the smartest thing you've ever said.

768
00:43:12,035 --> 00:43:14,000
Thank you.

769
00:43:14,035 --> 00:43:16,000
That's what I wanted to hear.

770
00:43:16,035 --> 00:43:18,000
Cheers.

771
00:43:18,035 --> 00:43:20,000
What are we celebrating?

772
00:43:20,035 --> 00:43:28,000
The fact that this calendar
is actually going to happen.

773
00:43:28,035 --> 00:43:30,000
Well, you haven't gotten me yet.

774
00:43:30,035 --> 00:43:33,000
Ever heard of a baker's dozen? I only need 12.

775
00:43:33,035 --> 00:43:42,000
You're the one I throw away.

776
00:43:42,035 --> 00:43:45,000
I know I'm asking a huge favor,
Max, but I really want them to look great.

777
00:43:45,035 --> 00:43:47,000
You're the only one I trust to shoot it.

778
00:43:47,035 --> 00:43:50,000
- It's the printer.
- Tell them I need to discuss desaturation with them.

779
00:43:50,035 --> 00:43:53,000
No, no: No, no, no:

780
00:43:53,035 --> 00:43:56,000
- It has to be shot before you go to Paris for fashion week.
- She'll be right with you.

781
00:43:56,035 --> 00:43:58,000
Really? Max, thank you. I love you.

782
00:43:58,035 --> 00:44:03,000
I'll call you next week with the details, Max.
Thank you. I love you.

783
00:44:03,035 --> 00:44:07,000
- Printer's waiting.
- Oh, crap.

784
00:44:07,035 --> 00:44:10,000
Oh, Hank, man, you missed
a great game on Thursday.

785
00:44:10,035 --> 00:44:13,000
I know.
I heard the Crusaders crushed Stillwater.

786
00:44:13,035 --> 00:44:14,000
What? Are you kidding me?

787
00:44:14,035 --> 00:44:18,000
- You waxed your chest?
- Yeah. We do have a shoot coming up.

788
00:44:18,035 --> 00:44:21,000
Doesn't mean he can't look good.

789
00:44:21,035 --> 00:44:23,000
Protein bar?

790
00:44:23,035 --> 00:44:25,000
There's nothing wrong
with trying to stay in shape.

791
00:44:25,035 --> 00:44:26,000
Oh. Oh, yeah?

792
00:44:26,035 --> 00:44:29,000
How many reps you do with
your nose hair clippers, Scotty?

793
00:44:29,035 --> 00:44:32,000
The whole point of this thing
was we were supposed to look naturaI.

794
00:44:32,035 --> 00:44:39,000
You know, you are looking kind of pale, Les.

795
00:44:39,035 --> 00:44:42,000
You know, you're not gonna get any darker
looking in that mirror there, buddy:

796
00:44:45,035 --> 00:44:48,000
What I expected, you know?
This calendar is making everybody nuts.

797
00:44:48,035 --> 00:44:51,000
You hear what Jan did to Bob?

798
00:44:51,035 --> 00:44:52,000
She caught him eating a doughnut.

799
00:44:52,035 --> 00:44:55,000
She grabs it out of his hand and says...

800
00:44:55,035 --> 00:44:57,000
The idea is to sell the calendars. "

801
00:44:57,035 --> 00:45:00,000
I don't know.
Jan's never been so bossy before.

802
00:45:00,035 --> 00:45:04,000
Well, she's never hung out with E.J. before.

803
00:45:04,035 --> 00:45:06,000
I'm thinking of asking Jan out.

804
00:45:06,035 --> 00:45:09,000
Yeah, well,
you know what you're getting yourself into.

805
00:45:09,035 --> 00:45:14,000
Just don't expect her to act any different
once E.J. leaves town.

806
00:45:14,035 --> 00:45:18,000
I mean, that is if Jan doesn't go with her.

807
00:45:18,035 --> 00:45:20,000
Uh, you're probably right.

808
00:45:20,035 --> 00:45:24,000
Anyway, it was just an idea.

809
00:45:24,035 --> 00:45:26,000
I can't believe I never realized...

810
00:45:26,035 --> 00:45:28,000
what a perverse movie The Wizard of Oz is.

811
00:45:28,035 --> 00:45:30,000
Seriously, you've got this lonely girI...

812
00:45:30,035 --> 00:45:32,000
who lives in
a black-and-white world in Kansas.

813
00:45:32,035 --> 00:45:35,000
No friends. Well, except her dog.

814
00:45:35,035 --> 00:45:37,000
If she stays there, she's gonna waste her life.

815
00:45:37,035 --> 00:45:40,000
Then she gets to go
someplace exciting, in color.

816
00:45:40,035 --> 00:45:44,000
Lots of adventure
and friends and a big future.

817
00:45:44,035 --> 00:45:47,000
And all she can do is moan,
There's no place like home"?

818
00:45:47,035 --> 00:45:49,000
I mean, by the end I was rooting for the witch.

819
00:45:51,035 --> 00:45:55,000
J:, The Wizard of Oz?

820
00:45:55,035 --> 00:45:57,000
You of all people wouldn't
be caught dead doing that in New York.

821
00:45:57,035 --> 00:46:00,000
Well, I've seen The Wizard of Oz a million
times, but I've never seen it in a theater.

822
00:46:00,035 --> 00:46:02,000
- It was really fun.
- And your date?

823
00:46:02,035 --> 00:46:04,000
- It was fun too.
- Are you gonna see him again?

824
00:46:04,035 --> 00:46:08,000
Uh-huh.
He asked me to go to an ab-sailing" party.

825
00:46:08,035 --> 00:46:17,000
I've got to figure out what to wear.

826
00:46:17,035 --> 00:46:19,000
Excuse me. What do you think?

827
00:46:19,035 --> 00:46:22,000
Um, it's a look.

828
00:46:22,035 --> 00:46:24,000
You're right!

829
00:46:24,035 --> 00:46:25,000
I've got to find something
for a sailing party...

830
00:46:25,035 --> 00:46:28,000
- and they haven't yet opened a Barney's in this town.
- Thank God.

831
00:46:28,035 --> 00:46:31,000
A breath of fresh cynicism.
You can't be from around here.

832
00:46:31,035 --> 00:46:33,000
Oh, I'm a New Yorker. I'm only here temporarily.

833
00:46:33,035 --> 00:46:38,000
- You're not E.J. Baxter, are you?
- I am. Who are you?

834
00:46:38,035 --> 00:46:43,000
- Sonya Kendall.
- GravitationaI NavigationaI G.P.S. Systems Sonya Kendall?

835
00:46:43,035 --> 00:46:45,000
No other.

836
00:46:45,035 --> 00:46:47,000
It used to be me and my ex-husband:::

837
00:46:47,035 --> 00:46:49,000
untiI I bought him out as part
of our divorce settlement.

838
00:46:49,035 --> 00:46:52,000
Since then, profits are up 15%.

839
00:46:52,035 --> 00:46:54,000
- Nice.
- Mm-hmm.

840
00:46:54,035 --> 00:46:55,000
When I got your press kit...

841
00:46:55,035 --> 00:46:59,000
I was so impressed that I thought I'd take
a quiet look-see around.

842
00:46:59,035 --> 00:47:02,000
But I'm worried this place is so quiet,
you'd swear it was a morgue.

843
00:47:02,035 --> 00:47:04,000
Mmm, well, it's not what
you're used to in Chicago...

844
00:47:04,035 --> 00:47:08,000
but it is the perfect place
for your corporate retreat.

845
00:47:08,035 --> 00:47:11,000
Trust me. As a city girI, you can really
recharge your batteries here.

846
00:47:11,035 --> 00:47:14,000
Well, my Zen master told me learning to fish
might relieve my stress.

847
00:47:14,035 --> 00:47:17,000
Oh! Oh, I have
the perfect instructor for you.

848
00:47:17,035 --> 00:47:19,000
His name is Jason. Call him.

849
00:47:19,035 --> 00:47:23,000
I'm the last person on earth who'd ever thought
she'd get into fishing, but trust me.

850
00:47:23,035 --> 00:47:25,000
- It's done wonders for me.
- Really?

851
00:47:25,035 --> 00:47:27,000
Mm-hmm.

852
00:47:27,035 --> 00:47:30,000
So is this sailing do on a yacht?

853
00:47:30,035 --> 00:47:34,000
I'll be lucky if it's not a blowup raft.

854
00:47:35,035 --> 00:47:38,000
Oh, hang on.

855
00:47:38,035 --> 00:47:40,000
- Hello?
- Hey, it's me.

856
00:47:40,035 --> 00:47:42,000
Oh, hang on.

857
00:47:42,035 --> 00:47:47,000
Roz, I'll call you back.

858
00:47:47,035 --> 00:47:49,000
- Hi, Jason.
- I'm so sorry.

859
00:47:49,035 --> 00:47:51,000
But I'm not gonna be able to make it.

860
00:47:51,035 --> 00:47:55,000
I'm stuck in bed with the weirdest allergic
reaction, or food poisoning.

861
00:47:55,035 --> 00:47:58,000
My ears are all stuffed up. I'm so sorry.

862
00:47:58,035 --> 00:48:01,000
Oh, no. I'm sorry. I hope you feeI better.

863
00:48:01,035 --> 00:48:04,000
There'll be other parties. Do you need anything?

864
00:48:04,035 --> 00:48:08,000
Yeah. For you to go without me
and have a great time.

865
00:48:08,035 --> 00:48:18,000
Bye.

866
00:48:35,035 --> 00:48:38,000
Hello.

867
00:48:38,035 --> 00:48:42,000
Interesting outfit.

868
00:48:42,035 --> 00:48:44,000
That's not a lake. Aren't we going sailing?

869
00:48:44,035 --> 00:48:47,000
No. We're going abseiling.

870
00:48:47,035 --> 00:48:53,000
You do know abseiling is
going down a mountain on a rope?

871
00:48:53,035 --> 00:48:56,000
Doesn't everybody?

872
00:48:56,035 --> 00:48:58,000
Where's Jason?

873
00:48:58,035 --> 00:49:00,000
He's very sorry. He's not feeling well.

874
00:49:00,035 --> 00:49:02,000
Mm-hmm.

875
00:49:02,035 --> 00:49:04,000
Ow!

876
00:49:04,035 --> 00:49:06,000
Eric.

877
00:49:06,035 --> 00:49:09,000
You want to help me into this?

878
00:49:09,035 --> 00:49:12,000
You know what? Ask Bonnie.
She's probably better at it than I am.

879
00:49:12,035 --> 00:49:14,000
Okay. All set.

880
00:49:14,035 --> 00:49:16,000
- Okay, I'm first.
- All right. Remember the motto.

881
00:49:16,035 --> 00:49:18,000
- Safety first.
- And the other one?

882
00:49:18,035 --> 00:49:20,000
- Don't die:
- That's right:

883
00:49:20,035 --> 00:49:22,000
- Get the lead out, Eric. Let's go.
- Your wife's bossy, David.

884
00:49:22,035 --> 00:49:24,000
You're preaching to the choir, man.

885
00:49:24,035 --> 00:49:26,000
- You ready?
- Double back?

886
00:49:26,035 --> 00:49:28,000
- Yeah, good. You good?
- Good.

887
00:49:28,035 --> 00:49:29,000
- One.
- Two:

888
00:49:29,035 --> 00:49:31,000
- Three.
- Let's go.

889
00:49:31,035 --> 00:49:33,000
- Let's go:
- Whoo-hoo!

890
00:49:33,035 --> 00:49:34,000
Whoo!

891
00:49:34,035 --> 00:49:37,000
Looking good:

892
00:49:37,035 --> 00:49:42,000
All rightl

893
00:49:42,035 --> 00:49:44,000
E.J., why don't you give it a try?

894
00:49:44,035 --> 00:49:47,000
Oh. Thanks.
But only my drinks are on the rocks.

895
00:49:47,035 --> 00:49:49,000
You'll be surprised how much fun it is.

896
00:49:49,035 --> 00:49:52,000
Mmm. Dangling over a cliff
is way out of my comfort zone.

897
00:49:52,035 --> 00:49:56,000
Weren't you the one that wanted us all
to take a leap of faith?

898
00:49:56,035 --> 00:50:01,000
Yeah, I thought that, uh,
stepping off the edge was your kind of thing.

899
00:50:01,035 --> 00:50:05,000
- Well?
- Will, don't torment her.

900
00:50:05,035 --> 00:50:07,000
, you don't have to do it
if you don't want to:

901
00:50:07,035 --> 00:50:09,000
Don't let him goad you.
You can always hike down.

902
00:50:09,035 --> 00:50:10,000
There's another way down?

903
00:50:10,035 --> 00:50:16,000
Yeah: But it's a hiking trail, not an elevator:

904
00:50:16,035 --> 00:50:19,000
You know what? I'm dying to do this.

905
00:50:19,035 --> 00:50:21,000
Dying.

906
00:50:21,035 --> 00:50:23,000
Off rappeI.

907
00:50:23,035 --> 00:50:26,000
- You wanna go again?
- Let's do it.

908
00:50:26,035 --> 00:50:29,000
- Race you to the top.
- All right!

909
00:50:29,035 --> 00:50:31,000
Okay, so look.
Nothing can happen. All right?

910
00:50:31,035 --> 00:50:34,000
You're clipped into that rope,
and that roped is anchored to that giant rock.

911
00:50:34,035 --> 00:50:37,000
- So don't worry.
- Yeah. You're fine, E.J. Trust Will.

912
00:50:37,035 --> 00:50:39,000
He can do this with his eyes closed.

913
00:50:39,035 --> 00:50:41,000
Yeah, it's a good idea.

914
00:50:41,035 --> 00:50:44,000
Ha: Funny:

915
00:50:44,035 --> 00:50:47,000
Just out of curiosity...

916
00:50:47,035 --> 00:50:49,000
how far, um, down is it?

917
00:50:49,035 --> 00:50:52,000
Uh, that is, like, 90, 100 feet.

918
00:50:52,035 --> 00:50:55,000
Look, just just just stare at your feet...

919
00:50:55,035 --> 00:50:58,000
and feed the rope through nice and slow.

920
00:50:58,035 --> 00:51:03,000
I can do it.
I got the safety lecture. I know what I'm doing.

921
00:51:03,035 --> 00:51:04,000
Okay. Well, then...

922
00:51:04,035 --> 00:51:10,000
lean back... very gently into your harness.

923
00:51:10,035 --> 00:51:12,000
- This rope's gonna take my weight?
- Oh, yeah.

924
00:51:12,035 --> 00:51:15,000
- That could take the weight of a bus and it wouldn't break.
- I'm not a bus.

925
00:51:15,035 --> 00:51:17,000
No. No, you're you're not a bus.

926
00:51:17,035 --> 00:51:19,000
You're not even a moped.

927
00:51:19,035 --> 00:51:21,000
No.

928
00:51:21,035 --> 00:51:23,000
Okay: There you go:

929
00:51:23,035 --> 00:51:25,000
Lean back slowly. ReaI gently.

930
00:51:25,035 --> 00:51:27,000
That's it:

931
00:51:27,035 --> 00:51:32,000
Nice and easy. Feed the rope through.

932
00:51:32,035 --> 00:51:36,000
Nice:

933
00:51:36,035 --> 00:51:38,000
- Nice.
- You're doing great!

934
00:51:38,035 --> 00:51:42,000
That's it.
Just feed the rope through nice and easy.

935
00:51:42,035 --> 00:51:45,000
Great:

936
00:51:45,035 --> 00:51:46,000
Great. You're doing great.

937
00:51:46,035 --> 00:51:49,000
- Keep the legs wide apart.
- Slow and steady:

938
00:51:49,035 --> 00:51:50,000
- Nice work, E:J:
- Yeah:

939
00:51:50,035 --> 00:51:53,000
- Just take it slow:
- You're doing awesomel

940
00:51:53,035 --> 00:51:55,000
You're doing great, E:J:

941
00:51:55,035 --> 00:51:58,000
That's itl

942
00:51:58,035 --> 00:52:00,000
How's the view?

943
00:52:00,035 --> 00:52:02,000
Oh, this is fantastic!

944
00:52:02,035 --> 00:52:08,000
I love itl
Wow:

945
00:52:08,035 --> 00:52:17,000
It's very far::: down:

946
00:52:17,035 --> 00:52:19,000
Keep going. You got it.

947
00:52:19,035 --> 00:52:22,000
- See? Not so bad:
- That's it:

948
00:52:22,035 --> 00:52:25,000
Just like I taught you:

949
00:52:25,035 --> 00:52:29,000
Look at you! You're a pro!

950
00:52:37,035 --> 00:52:39,000
Hey, E.J., you okay?

951
00:52:42,035 --> 00:52:44,000
- What happened?
- Give me a helmet.

952
00:52:44,035 --> 00:52:46,000
Will, what's wrong?

953
00:52:46,035 --> 00:52:48,000
- What did she do?
- Can you see what's going on?

954
00:52:48,035 --> 00:52:53,000
- I think she gripped up.
- Here I come!

955
00:52:53,035 --> 00:52:55,000
, stay calml

956
00:52:55,035 --> 00:52:57,000

957
00:53:03,035 --> 00:53:09,000
All right, E.J.,
just hold tight. I'm on my way.

958
00:53:09,035 --> 00:53:13,000
There we go.

959
00:53:13,035 --> 00:53:15,000
You okay? Huh?

960
00:53:15,035 --> 00:53:17,000
- Are you faint or dizzy?
- Mm-mmm.

961
00:53:17,035 --> 00:53:20,000
- Okay, can you move?
- Mm-mmm. Mm-mmm. Mm-mmm.

962
00:53:20,035 --> 00:53:23,000
Yeah, you can. You can move.
ReaI nice and easy. Just let the rope out.

963
00:53:23,035 --> 00:53:25,000
- No.
- Why not?

964
00:53:25,035 --> 00:53:30,000
- Fall.
- No. You can't You can't fall, okay?

965
00:53:30,035 --> 00:53:32,000
I promise, you can't. I'm gonna help you down.

966
00:53:32,035 --> 00:53:35,000
Okay. Now listen, E.J. I know you can do this.

967
00:53:40,035 --> 00:53:44,000
So it's you I've got to trust?

968
00:53:44,035 --> 00:53:46,000
Yeah. Yeah, I'm afraid so.

969
00:53:46,035 --> 00:53:48,000
- Oh
- Your life is in my hands.

970
00:53:48,035 --> 00:53:51,000
How about that?
Come on now. I know you can do this.

971
00:53:51,035 --> 00:53:53,000
- You ready?
- Mm-hmm.

972
00:53:53,035 --> 00:53:56,000
Let's go, really nice and slow.
Just let the rope out just a little.

973
00:53:56,035 --> 00:53:59,000
- There. You got it. You're fine.
- Where's the floor?

974
00:53:59,035 --> 00:54:04,000
It's right here.
You're coming. Great job.

975
00:54:04,035 --> 00:54:07,000
That's great.

976
00:54:21,035 --> 00:54:24,000
Hey, E:J: We saw what happened there:

977
00:54:24,035 --> 00:54:27,000
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

978
00:54:27,035 --> 00:54:30,000
- Then again, I had a good teacher.
- Yeah. Yeah, you did.

979
00:54:30,035 --> 00:54:33,000
Wait untiI Jason sees
the pictures that David took.

980
00:54:33,035 --> 00:54:35,000
- He's gonna want to take you up here himself.
- Yeah.

981
00:54:35,035 --> 00:54:42,000
- You think so?
- Yeah. I'm sure he'd love to.

982
00:54:42,035 --> 00:54:46,000
Will, I just wanted to say...

983
00:54:46,035 --> 00:54:50,000
thank you.

984
00:54:50,035 --> 00:55:00,000
Yeah, take care.

985
00:55:00,035 --> 00:55:02,000
Hey, it's Jason. You know what to do.

986
00:55:02,035 --> 00:55:06,000
Hi, it's E.J. The flowers are gorgeous.

987
00:55:06,035 --> 00:55:08,000
You really shouldn't have. But I'm glad you did.

988
00:55:08,035 --> 00:55:14,000
I hope you're feeling better and

989
00:55:14,035 --> 00:55:18,000
- You have a visitor.
- Who?

990
00:55:18,035 --> 00:55:23,000
- Can I speak to you?
- By all means, Mr. Albrecht.

991
00:55:23,035 --> 00:55:25,000
Sorry I didn't call first.

992
00:55:25,035 --> 00:55:27,000
Apology accepted.

993
00:55:27,035 --> 00:55:32,000
So tell me.
How can the Tourist Bureau help you today?

994
00:55:32,035 --> 00:55:36,000
How do you stand it in here?
You know, really, uh really stuffy.

995
00:55:36,035 --> 00:55:38,000
Sadly, the weather is beyond my controI.

996
00:55:38,035 --> 00:55:43,000
- Shall I open a window?
- No, no, no, no. It's fine. I just, um

997
00:55:43,035 --> 00:55:46,000
Well, first of all,
my business partners and I...

998
00:55:46,035 --> 00:55:50,000
have been giving this calendar
some carefuI consideration.

999
00:55:50,035 --> 00:55:54,000
And I've decided Um, uh, we've decided...

1000
00:55:54,035 --> 00:55:56,000
that, um, we'd like to sponsor it.

1001
00:55:56,035 --> 00:55:59,000
We'll pay for all the production costs,
which will, um...

1002
00:55:59,035 --> 00:56:02,000
make the, uh, finaI profit... higher.

1003
00:56:02,035 --> 00:56:06,000
Well, this is a very generous offer,
but I'm a little confused.

1004
00:56:06,035 --> 00:56:11,000
Uh Well, I admit that I still have my
misgivings about the whole thing.

1005
00:56:11,035 --> 00:56:13,000
But as long as the calendar's gonna go ahead,
we might as well...

1006
00:56:13,035 --> 00:56:16,000
try and make it as successfuI as possible.

1007
00:56:16,035 --> 00:56:19,000
So you're doing this
for purely altruistic reasons...

1008
00:56:19,035 --> 00:56:23,000
with no thoughts whatsoever
of how this might help your own business.

1009
00:56:25,035 --> 00:56:28,000
Um, look, i-it's a naturaI tie-in to our store.

1010
00:56:28,035 --> 00:56:32,000
But more importantly, I like... to help people.

1011
00:56:32,035 --> 00:56:34,000
AndAnd sometimes
people get hurt, you know?

1012
00:56:34,035 --> 00:56:37,000
And I don't know. You don't mean
for them to get hurt, but people

1013
00:56:37,035 --> 00:56:45,000
I'm sorry. What are you trying to say?

1014
00:56:45,035 --> 00:56:50,000
I have feelings for you.

1015
00:56:50,035 --> 00:56:52,000
And it's awfuI.

1016
00:56:52,035 --> 00:56:55,000
I mean, you are bossy:::

1017
00:56:55,035 --> 00:56:57,000
and you're rude and and way too opinionated:

1018
00:56:57,035 --> 00:57:00,000
And you're arrogant. God, are you arrogant.

1019
00:57:00,035 --> 00:57:04,000
I mean, you really do think that God created
the world with your help.

1020
00:57:04,035 --> 00:57:05,000
It's

1021
00:57:05,035 --> 00:57:09,000
I- I I'd hoped that these feelings would pass...

1022
00:57:09,035 --> 00:57:12,000
but, well, the heart feels what the heart feels.

1023
00:57:12,035 --> 00:57:15,000
- Even if it makes the stomach ill?
- I see we're on the same page.

1024
00:57:15,035 --> 00:57:19,000
I don't know when
I've ever heard it put more eloquently.

1025
00:57:19,035 --> 00:57:23,000
In the past when someone has told me
he has feelings for me that I don't share...

1026
00:57:23,035 --> 00:57:26,000
I've done whatever I could to ease the pain.

1027
00:57:26,035 --> 00:57:28,000
- But that was then!
- No, no, no.

1028
00:57:28,035 --> 00:57:31,000
Look, I'm just as repulsed by this as you are.

1029
00:57:31,035 --> 00:57:33,000
- Repulsed?
- No, no, no. Not repulsed.

1030
00:57:33,035 --> 00:57:37,000
Look. Would you rather me have lied
and pretended that I was happy?

1031
00:57:37,035 --> 00:57:39,000
- I can't imagine that you
- That I wouldn't be thrilled?

1032
00:57:39,035 --> 00:57:41,000
What woman could resist you
after hearing that?

1033
00:57:41,035 --> 00:57:43,000
You know, I wouldn't be interested in you...

1034
00:57:43,035 --> 00:57:46,000
if this was I Am Legend
and you were the last man on earth.

1035
00:57:46,035 --> 00:57:48,000
But even if I wasn't sickened by you...

1036
00:57:48,035 --> 00:57:51,000
the fact that you delight in
ruining other people's lives

1037
00:57:51,035 --> 00:57:53,000
Oh, whoa. Hold on. What?

1038
00:57:53,035 --> 00:57:56,000
Jason. Are you even
going to deny that you cost him a job?

1039
00:57:56,035 --> 00:58:00,000
Oh, yeah, Jason.

1040
00:58:00,035 --> 00:58:02,000
He's had a reaI tough time of it.

1041
00:58:02,035 --> 00:58:05,000
If I'm not being too rude,
can I ask you, how well do you know Jason?

1042
00:58:05,035 --> 00:58:09,000
Ah, well enough. And you're always rude.

1043
00:58:09,035 --> 00:58:14,000
Mmm. Well, excuse me
for warning you to be carefuI.

1044
00:58:14,035 --> 00:58:16,000
As to the other purpose of your visit

1045
00:58:16,035 --> 00:58:20,000
while we appreciate your very generous offer,
we already have a major sponsor.

1046
00:58:20,035 --> 00:58:22,000
Oh, really? Who?

1047
00:58:22,035 --> 00:58:24,000
A company much bigger than yours.

1048
00:58:24,035 --> 00:58:28,000
Hmm.

1049
00:58:32,035 --> 00:58:35,000
- E.J.?
- Hmm?

1050
00:58:35,035 --> 00:58:45,000
- What major sponsor?
- I will find one.

1051
00:58:45,035 --> 00:58:47,000
How do I get to Buffalo Hill Drive?

1052
00:58:47,035 --> 00:58:53,000
- Isn't it about time you got yourself a G.P.S.?
- I don't need a G.P.S.!

1053
00:58:53,035 --> 00:58:57,000
Actually, I do.

1054
00:58:57,035 --> 00:59:01,000
I love it: Real men instead of
the usual bunch of bruisers:::

1055
00:59:01,035 --> 00:59:03,000
on weekend detention.

1056
00:59:03,035 --> 00:59:07,000
My team and I all agree
we'd love to sponsor it, E.J.

1057
00:59:07,035 --> 00:59:10,000
That is fantastic news.
Thank you so much, Sonya.

1058
00:59:10,035 --> 00:59:14,000
Yes. Talk soon.

1059
00:59:14,035 --> 00:59:15,000
Yes.

1060
00:59:15,035 --> 00:59:18,000
Mike. Are you ready for tomorrow?

1061
00:59:18,035 --> 00:59:21,000
Why aren't you outside doing some crunches?

1062
00:59:22,035 --> 00:59:24,000
Mike, you can't back out now.

1063
00:59:24,035 --> 00:59:28,000
I've tried to convince myself
that I could do this.

1064
00:59:28,035 --> 00:59:30,000
I have exercised. I stayed off carbs.

1065
00:59:30,035 --> 00:59:33,000
I even... waxed.

1066
00:59:33,035 --> 00:59:36,000
But I can't pose.

1067
00:59:36,035 --> 00:59:38,000
It's naturaI to be nervous.
But just think about

1068
00:59:38,035 --> 00:59:42,000
The squad? Oh, believe me, I have.

1069
00:59:42,035 --> 00:59:44,000
You convinced me that this is a great idea.

1070
00:59:44,035 --> 00:59:47,000
I'll go door-to-door:
I'll sell as many calendars as I can:

1071
00:59:47,035 --> 00:59:50,000
Just show up tomorrow and see how you feeI.

1072
00:59:50,035 --> 00:59:54,000
It's killing me to know
that I'll be letting down the rescue squad.

1073
00:59:54,035 --> 00:59:57,000
Maybe a little drink will help you relax.
We can do that.

1074
00:59:57,035 --> 01:00:01,000
Even if I got blind drunk, I still
wouldn't be able to do it.

1075
01:00:01,035 --> 01:00:07,000
I wish you could convince me, but you can't.

1076
01:00:07,035 --> 01:00:09,000
E.J., I really need to talk to you.

1077
01:00:09,035 --> 01:00:12,000
- Max, I need a minute.
- I'm sorry...

1078
01:00:12,035 --> 01:00:16,000
but we really have a million details to discuss
about the shoot tomorrow.

1079
01:00:27,035 --> 01:00:30,000
- Nice.
- # If you're paying all your dues off #

1080
01:00:30,035 --> 01:00:32,000
- Won't look.
- # Come on, baby, take your shoes off #

1081
01:00:32,035 --> 01:00:36,000
- Uh, could you lose the jacket?
- # We're going back out on the dance floor #

1082
01:00:36,035 --> 01:00:39,000
# We're gonna show 'em
what you're made of #

1083
01:00:39,035 --> 01:00:42,000
# Shake it back #

1084
01:00:42,035 --> 01:00:44,000
# And now I got your attention #

1085
01:00:44,035 --> 01:00:47,000
# Got your body
purring like an engine #

1086
01:00:47,035 --> 01:00:49,000
Max, don't worry:

1087
01:00:49,035 --> 01:00:51,000
- Come on.
- I got it. David, come on out. We need to see you.

1088
01:00:51,035 --> 01:00:55,000
- It's cold. Ow.
- I know it's cold, but it's gonna

1089
01:00:55,035 --> 01:00:57,000
- It's not cold. There you go. That's great.
- Yeah, it is.

1090
01:00:57,035 --> 01:01:00,000
# I know you got rhythm
and I know you got soul #

1091
01:01:00,035 --> 01:01:02,000
# But there ain't nothin'
here for us, baby #

1092
01:01:02,035 --> 01:01:05,000
- # Gotta get outta town #
- # Get, get, get out #

1093
01:01:05,035 --> 01:01:09,000
- # We gotta get outta town #
- # Get, get, get out #

1094
01:01:09,035 --> 01:01:12,000
- # We gotta get outta town #
- # Get, get, get out #

1095
01:01:12,035 --> 01:01:14,000
- # We gotta get outta #
- Try this.

1096
01:01:14,035 --> 01:01:19,000
For me?

1097
01:01:19,035 --> 01:01:23,000
# Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na #

1098
01:01:23,035 --> 01:01:26,000
- # Well, if you're feeling kind of locked down #
- You want that.

1099
01:01:26,035 --> 01:01:29,000
# When you should be
feeling knocked out #

1100
01:01:29,035 --> 01:01:32,000
Rick, at me.

1101
01:01:32,035 --> 01:01:35,000
# I'm gonna stop your heart bleeding #

1102
01:01:35,035 --> 01:01:38,000
# Shake it back #

1103
01:01:38,035 --> 01:01:41,000
# Nine, eight, seven, six
five, four, three #

1104
01:01:41,035 --> 01:01:43,000
# Everything is backwards here #

1105
01:01:43,035 --> 01:01:44,000
- Here you go.
- This?

1106
01:01:44,035 --> 01:01:45,000
- Yeah. Good.
- All right.

1107
01:01:45,035 --> 01:01:48,000
- # Gotta get outta town #
- # Get, get, get out #

1108
01:01:48,035 --> 01:01:50,000
# We gotta get outta town #

1109
01:01:50,035 --> 01:01:53,000
- No, I don't think so.
- # We gotta get outta town #

1110
01:01:53,035 --> 01:01:54,000
# Get, get, get out #

1111
01:01:54,035 --> 01:02:02,000
- # We gotta get outta town #
- # Get, get, get out #

1112
01:02:02,035 --> 01:02:03,000
Ah.

1113
01:02:03,035 --> 01:02:04,000
Oh.

1114
01:02:04,035 --> 01:02:07,000
Sorry.

1115
01:02:07,035 --> 01:02:11,000
He likes you:

1116
01:02:11,035 --> 01:02:15,000
Buster. Uh

1117
01:02:15,035 --> 01:02:19,000
We just want you to pretend
that you're having fun, enjoying yourself.

1118
01:02:19,035 --> 01:02:22,000
And

1119
01:02:32,035 --> 01:02:35,000
- # I kiss you once #
- Very good.

1120
01:02:35,035 --> 01:02:37,000
# All right
I kiss you twice #

1121
01:02:37,035 --> 01:02:40,000
- Whoop.
- # That's fine, I kiss you three times #

1122
01:02:40,035 --> 01:02:43,000
# One more time
I kiss you four times #

1123
01:02:43,035 --> 01:02:45,000
# Baby, you're mine
you're mine #

1124
01:02:45,035 --> 01:02:47,000
# If you're chasing down
a lost cause #

1125
01:02:47,035 --> 01:02:50,000
# You gotta run at it
at full force #

1126
01:02:50,035 --> 01:02:52,000
# You can't be
pulling any punches #

1127
01:02:52,035 --> 01:02:55,000
# Oh, you know
you gotta live for something #

1128
01:02:55,035 --> 01:02:59,000
# Well, shake it back #

1129
01:02:59,035 --> 01:03:02,000
# Well, I know you got rhythm
and I know you got soul #

1130
01:03:02,035 --> 01:03:05,000
- That doesn't suck.
- That doesn't suck at all.

1131
01:03:05,035 --> 01:03:08,000
- # Gotta get outta town #
- # Get, get, get out #

1132
01:03:08,035 --> 01:03:11,000
- # I gotta get outta town #
- Buster.

1133
01:03:11,035 --> 01:03:13,000
# You gotta get outta town #

1134
01:03:13,035 --> 01:03:14,000
# Get, get, get out #

1135
01:03:14,035 --> 01:03:16,000
# You gotta get outta town #

1136
01:03:16,035 --> 01:03:18,000
- Oh.
- # Need to get outta town #

1137
01:03:18,035 --> 01:03:19,000
# Get, get, get out #

1138
01:03:19,035 --> 01:03:20,000
# Get, get, get, get outta town #

1139
01:03:20,035 --> 01:03:22,000
# Get, get, get out #

1140
01:03:22,035 --> 01:03:25,000
- # Get, get, get, get outta town #
- # Get, get, get out #

1141
01:03:25,035 --> 01:03:32,000
- # Get, get, get, get outta town #
- # Get, get, get out ##

1142
01:03:33,035 --> 01:03:35,000
- Heyl
- Heyl That's it:

1143
01:03:52,035 --> 01:03:54,000
You still don't have Mr. December.

1144
01:03:54,035 --> 01:03:59,000
Mm-hmm. Marci, are there any former members
of the squad we could ask?

1145
01:03:59,035 --> 01:04:01,000
Trust me, none that anyone
would ever want to look at...

1146
01:04:01,035 --> 01:04:03,000
even with their clothes on:

1147
01:04:03,035 --> 01:04:07,000
Maybe we could do a Christmas group shot.

1148
01:04:07,035 --> 01:04:09,000
- No. I want this to be so great
- Kalispell Tourism:

1149
01:04:09,035 --> 01:04:13,000
that not just the people around here buy it but,
say, People magazine or Oprah calls.

1150
01:04:13,035 --> 01:04:17,000
We get to explain to them why this was
important and why the guys stood behind it.

1151
01:04:17,035 --> 01:04:20,000
Okay. Thanks. I'll tell her.

1152
01:04:20,035 --> 01:04:25,000
We've got a Mr. December.

1153
01:04:37,035 --> 01:04:38,000
Ah.

1154
01:05:02,035 --> 01:05:05,000
Hey, it's Jason.

1155
01:05:05,035 --> 01:05:07,000
Sorry: I have to cancel again:

1156
01:05:07,035 --> 01:05:11,000
No, I'm not sick:
I might actually have a really good job:

1157
01:05:11,035 --> 01:05:13,000
I'll be out of town for a while:

1158
01:05:13,035 --> 01:05:16,000
I don't want to talk about it yet
because I know it'll jinx it:

1159
01:05:16,035 --> 01:05:21,000
But wish me good luck: Bye:

1160
01:05:21,035 --> 01:05:23,000
Dump him.

1161
01:05:23,035 --> 01:05:25,000
The E.J. I know wouldn't take that from a guy.

1162
01:05:25,035 --> 01:05:29,000
I know. It's bothering me
that it's not bothering me.

1163
01:05:29,035 --> 01:05:31,000
- Does the thought of him give you butterflies?
- No.

1164
01:05:31,035 --> 01:05:34,000
There's your answer:
He was never anything but the rebound guy:

1165
01:05:34,035 --> 01:05:37,000
- Oh, my God.
- I know. I'm damn good.

1166
01:05:37,035 --> 01:05:42,000
It's not that. It's the first time
I've driven to work without getting lost.

1167
01:05:46,035 --> 01:05:49,000
Eddie, can we get another round?

1168
01:05:49,035 --> 01:05:51,000
Say, do I know you?

1169
01:05:51,035 --> 01:05:53,000
What's goin' on?

1170
01:05:53,035 --> 01:05:56,000
I mean, I admit the face looks familiar but

1171
01:05:56,035 --> 01:05:58,000
Yeah, okay, Eddie. Cut the crap.

1172
01:05:58,035 --> 01:06:02,000
Sorry. I didn't mean to insult you guys. I didn't
recognize any of you with your clothes on.

1173
01:06:03,035 --> 01:06:05,000
- Sorry. Couldn't resist.
- You know

1174
01:06:05,035 --> 01:06:07,000
- Don't say it, Bob.
- I have to.

1175
01:06:07,035 --> 01:06:09,000
I'm serious. If you say it, I'll punch you.

1176
01:06:09,035 --> 01:06:13,000
- Did we just make the biggest mistake of our lives?
- Why did you have to say it?

1177
01:06:13,035 --> 01:06:15,000
Hey, guys. I've seen the photos.

1178
01:06:15,035 --> 01:06:17,000
And you have nothing to be ashamed of.

1179
01:06:17,035 --> 01:06:19,000
- Really?
- Yeah.

1180
01:06:19,035 --> 01:06:22,000
- You look incredibly hot:
- Come on.

1181
01:06:22,035 --> 01:06:26,000
You oughta use yours as
your next campaign poster, Mr. Mayor.

1182
01:06:26,035 --> 01:06:28,000
Well, there might be something to that.

1183
01:06:28,035 --> 01:06:31,000
- Can I have you sign mine?
- Like an autograph?

1184
01:06:31,035 --> 01:06:32,000
Yeah:

1185
01:06:32,035 --> 01:06:39,000
Check it out: Check it out:

1186
01:06:39,035 --> 01:06:43,000
That's enough, guys: This is a respectable
establishment: I know what to do with this:

1187
01:06:43,035 --> 01:06:45,000
Yeah, thank you.

1188
01:06:45,035 --> 01:06:49,000
Hah?

1189
01:06:49,035 --> 01:06:53,000
No, come on!

1190
01:06:53,035 --> 01:06:56,000
- These are really great.
- Mmm.

1191
01:06:56,035 --> 01:06:59,000
You've caught the essence
of each guy perfectly.

1192
01:06:59,035 --> 01:07:02,000
- Wait till you see them after they're Photoshopped.
- I don't know if we should.

1193
01:07:02,035 --> 01:07:05,000
- But they'II look so much sexier.
- I know, but

1194
01:07:05,035 --> 01:07:07,000
- And this is a bad thing?
- No: It is not a bad thing:

1195
01:07:07,035 --> 01:07:10,000
And you know me: I'm always the one
to scream for more airbrushing:::

1196
01:07:10,035 --> 01:07:13,000
so everyone looks perfect, but look at that:

1197
01:07:13,035 --> 01:07:16,000
True beauty right there.

1198
01:07:16,035 --> 01:07:18,000
Hi.

1199
01:07:18,035 --> 01:07:22,000
Oh, yes. Mr. December. Hello.

1200
01:07:22,035 --> 01:07:24,000
Hey, again.

1201
01:07:24,035 --> 01:07:27,000
You win. We go with the naturaI look.

1202
01:07:27,035 --> 01:07:30,000
Thank you, Max. They are fabulous.

1203
01:07:30,035 --> 01:07:33,000
Hmm.

1204
01:07:33,035 --> 01:07:36,000
So, no doubt...

1205
01:07:36,035 --> 01:07:38,000
that you can't believe that
I find the aesthetic appeaI

1206
01:07:38,035 --> 01:07:47,000
You need to shut up.

1207
01:07:48,035 --> 01:08:05,000
- Ooh. I'm, uh I'm sorry. I didn't mean to
- No, no. You shut up.

1208
01:08:05,035 --> 01:08:08,000
Was I really such
an uptight bitch when you met me?

1209
01:08:08,035 --> 01:08:11,000
Yeah, you were horrible.

1210
01:08:11,035 --> 01:08:13,000
I'm very sorry.

1211
01:08:13,035 --> 01:08:18,000
But you were lovely.
Was I really such an arrogant jerk?

1212
01:08:18,035 --> 01:08:20,000
- Nothing more than normaI.
- Ooh.

1213
01:08:20,035 --> 01:08:23,000
Well, I am very sorry.

1214
01:08:23,035 --> 01:08:25,000
But you were hot.

1215
01:08:25,035 --> 01:08:28,000
- I know.
- Oh, my God.

1216
01:08:28,035 --> 01:08:31,000
You know, I kept thinking
that I should probably...

1217
01:08:31,035 --> 01:08:35,000
you know, ask you to hand me a toweI so
I could cover up before I got out of the pooI.

1218
01:08:35,035 --> 01:08:37,000
But, no, somehow I just couldn't.

1219
01:08:37,035 --> 01:08:41,000
Remember how I pretended I wasn't looking?

1220
01:08:41,035 --> 01:08:43,000
- Mm-hmm.
- I was.

1221
01:08:43,035 --> 01:08:46,000
- Well, I hope so.
- Oh, but

1222
01:08:46,035 --> 01:08:49,000
Oh.

1223
01:08:49,035 --> 01:08:56,000
I'll get rid of that.

1224
01:08:56,035 --> 01:08:58,000
It fit perfectly.

1225
01:08:58,035 --> 01:09:01,000
On you, it's a maxi. On me, it's a mini.

1226
01:09:01,035 --> 01:09:05,000
I can't thank you enough.
And David thanks you even m

1227
01:09:05,035 --> 01:09:07,000
Hey, Marci.

1228
01:09:07,035 --> 01:09:12,000
Will?

1229
01:09:12,035 --> 01:09:15,000
Oh, no. You're not gonna find any, um...

1230
01:09:15,035 --> 01:09:19,000
drawn knives or smashed pots.

1231
01:09:24,035 --> 01:09:27,000
If you're coming home for the holidays,
you better make your reservations now.

1232
01:09:27,035 --> 01:09:31,000
- I don't think I'm gonna make it.
- But the calendar will have already been launched.

1233
01:09:31,035 --> 01:09:34,000
I just want to spend Christmas with Will.

1234
01:09:34,035 --> 01:09:36,000
Ooh, I thought Christmas
didn't mean anything to you.

1235
01:09:36,035 --> 01:09:39,000
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Uh-huh: Uh-huh:

1236
01:09:39,035 --> 01:09:42,000
At least let us come out then for Thanksgiving.
We haven't seen you in a century.

1237
01:09:42,035 --> 01:09:45,000
Howie and I want to meet the people
who live in the hole in the ground.

1238
01:09:45,035 --> 01:09:48,000
Might be a little soon.
Will and I just want to hang in our own space.

1239
01:09:48,035 --> 01:09:51,000
But But you're having 12 people over
for Thanksgiving dinner.

1240
01:09:51,035 --> 01:09:53,000
I don't really think it's your kind of scene.

1241
01:09:53,035 --> 01:09:55,000
You're not gonna let me meet him till after
your third anniversary.

1242
01:09:55,035 --> 01:09:58,000
I'm at work. I gotta go. Bye.

1243
01:09:58,035 --> 01:10:02,000
Coffee shop on Meridian. Excellent.

1244
01:10:02,035 --> 01:10:09,000
What?

1245
01:10:09,035 --> 01:10:10,000
Oh.

1246
01:10:17,035 --> 01:10:19,000
That photo that was taken
right next to my place:

1247
01:10:19,035 --> 01:10:22,000
I think they turned out really nice.

1248
01:10:22,035 --> 01:10:24,000
# I like to rock #

1249
01:10:24,035 --> 01:10:26,000
# I like to rock #

1250
01:10:26,035 --> 01:10:30,000
Oh, come on, hon. Stand there. Perfect.

1251
01:10:30,035 --> 01:10:34,000
Oh, you've never looked cuter.

1252
01:10:34,035 --> 01:10:36,000
Wow: It's, like, professional:

1253
01:10:36,035 --> 01:10:39,000
I figured it would be this small little thing.

1254
01:10:42,035 --> 01:10:45,000
You look really good, Henry.
I think I look like crap.

1255
01:10:45,035 --> 01:10:49,000
No, Les.
You look great. I just look better.

1256
01:10:49,035 --> 01:10:56,000
- Excuse me. Would you guys sign my calendar?
- Sure.

1257
01:10:56,035 --> 01:10:57,000
- Thanks.
- Can I get you guys too?

1258
01:10:57,035 --> 01:11:01,000
- Yeah, I'll sign that.
- This is so exciting.

1259
01:11:01,035 --> 01:11:03,000
- Hey, E:J: Great party:
- Hi.

1260
01:11:03,035 --> 01:11:04,000
Hi.

1261
01:11:09,035 --> 01:11:11,000
Congratulations, darling.

1262
01:11:11,035 --> 01:11:13,000
I'm just mad about your new venture.

1263
01:11:25,035 --> 01:11:27,000
- Say beerl
- Beer!

1264
01:11:27,035 --> 01:11:31,000
Excellent, y'all. Congratulations. I told you.

1265
01:11:35,035 --> 01:11:39,000
Jan looks hot tonight:

1266
01:11:39,035 --> 01:11:47,000
Occasionally I can be wrong.

1267
01:11:56,035 --> 01:11:59,000
- Now we know why Laura didn't show.
- You two can't be sure.

1268
01:11:59,035 --> 01:12:01,000
- Maybe he's just
- No, trust me.

1269
01:12:01,035 --> 01:12:03,000
She is not hiring Rick to be her plumber.

1270
01:12:03,035 --> 01:12:05,000
I thought he and Laura were happy.

1271
01:12:05,035 --> 01:12:07,000
Oh, honey, I love you.

1272
01:12:23,035 --> 01:12:25,000
Great.

1273
01:12:25,035 --> 01:12:29,000
Thanks so much for your time. Thank you.

1274
01:12:29,035 --> 01:12:33,000
- I love this song.
- I, uh I can't dance.

1275
01:12:33,035 --> 01:12:37,000
Don't worry. I'll be gentle.

1276
01:12:37,035 --> 01:12:41,000
Come here.

1277
01:12:41,035 --> 01:12:45,000
I know you told me,
but I just didn't believe it.

1278
01:12:45,035 --> 01:12:52,000
- Hmm.
- Hell has frozen over.

1279
01:12:52,035 --> 01:12:59,000
# The last thing that
we talked about #

1280
01:12:59,035 --> 01:13:02,000
# Was the first thing that we #

1281
01:13:02,035 --> 01:13:03,000
- What?
- Dance.

1282
01:13:03,035 --> 01:13:09,000
Excuse me. Shall we?

1283
01:13:12,035 --> 01:13:16,000
- My butt's vibrating.
- Ignore it.

1284
01:13:16,035 --> 01:13:20,000
Just ignore it.

1285
01:13:20,035 --> 01:13:24,000
# So far so bad #

1286
01:13:24,035 --> 01:13:34,000
# Is all that I
can think about #

1287
01:13:34,035 --> 01:13:37,000
Thanks.

1288
01:13:37,035 --> 01:13:39,000
Have you seen this?

1289
01:13:39,035 --> 01:13:41,000
Someone's started a campaign
against the calendar.

1290
01:13:41,035 --> 01:13:44,000
They're saying children
shouldn't be allowed to see it.

1291
01:13:44,035 --> 01:13:46,000
- But no one's seen it.
- It's crazy.

1292
01:13:46,035 --> 01:13:50,000
- There's nothing pornographic about it.
- I know.

1293
01:13:50,035 --> 01:13:55,000
Still, the more they scream,
the more calendars we'll sell.

1294
01:13:55,035 --> 01:14:01,000
- Good.
- Good.

1295
01:14:01,035 --> 01:14:03,000
Uh Hello?

1296
01:14:03,035 --> 01:14:05,000
Playing hard to get. Very cute.

1297
01:14:05,035 --> 01:14:09,000
Now look, my spies e-mailed me
your saucy little calendar.

1298
01:14:09,035 --> 01:14:11,000
Darling, let's let bygones
be has-beens, shall we?

1299
01:14:11,035 --> 01:14:13,000
What's one pair of Gucci pumps
between friends?

1300
01:14:19,035 --> 01:14:20,000
Hi.

1301
01:14:20,035 --> 01:14:23,000
- E.J.
- Hi.

1302
01:14:23,035 --> 01:14:25,000
- I I
- Hi.

1303
01:14:25,035 --> 01:14:27,000
Oh. Sorry.

1304
01:14:27,035 --> 01:14:29,000
That's okay.

1305
01:14:29,035 --> 01:14:32,000
- Uh, you've been
- I know.

1306
01:14:32,035 --> 01:14:36,000
- I've been bad. No excuses.
- Oh, no. No, I'm glad you're back.

1307
01:14:36,035 --> 01:14:38,000
- Uh, did you get the job?
- Yeah.

1308
01:14:38,035 --> 01:14:42,000
That's great. That's great.
Um, tell me about it.

1309
01:14:42,035 --> 01:14:45,000
Well, it's in Chicago. And, uh

1310
01:14:45,035 --> 01:14:49,000
Oh, there you are.
I don't know how to thank you, E.J.

1311
01:14:49,035 --> 01:14:52,000
- For what?
- Well, I reeled in more than a fish.

1312
01:14:52,035 --> 01:14:56,000
I got a great boyfriend.

1313
01:14:56,035 --> 01:14:59,000
Well, he was just telling me
about his good fortune.

1314
01:14:59,035 --> 01:15:00,000
Oh.

1315
01:15:00,035 --> 01:15:03,000
She probably felt entitled to a souvenir.

1316
01:15:03,035 --> 01:15:06,000
Who knows? Maybe they're the answer
to each other's prayers.

1317
01:15:06,035 --> 01:15:08,000
Actually, we should publicize it.

1318
01:15:08,035 --> 01:15:15,000
LocaI calendar man strikes it rich. "

1319
01:15:15,035 --> 01:15:20,000
I know you don't want to hear this, but Will was
right to warn you about Jason.

1320
01:15:20,035 --> 01:15:23,000
Yes, I know you'll kill me
if ever I mention it to him.

1321
01:15:23,035 --> 01:15:25,000
Mm-hmm. Good night.

1322
01:15:25,035 --> 01:15:27,000
Okay. Of course.

1323
01:15:29,035 --> 01:15:32,000
Oh.

1324
01:15:32,035 --> 01:15:34,000
Hello?

1325
01:15:34,035 --> 01:15:36,000
At least here me out, okay?

1326
01:15:36,035 --> 01:15:39,000
It's not often that I admit
that I made a... mistake.

1327
01:15:39,035 --> 01:15:42,000
Come back to work.
If it'll seaI the deaI, I'll fire Noah.

1328
01:15:42,035 --> 01:15:46,000
We're both too professionaI to let such
an unimpressive man come between us.

1329
01:15:46,035 --> 01:15:49,000
Oh, I totally agree, but I'm not sure E.J. will.

1330
01:15:49,035 --> 01:15:55,000
Who the hell is this?

1331
01:15:55,035 --> 01:15:59,000
Excuse me.
I think you might want to take this.

1332
01:15:59,035 --> 01:16:03,000
Hello?

1333
01:16:03,035 --> 01:16:06,000
What's the matter?

1334
01:16:06,035 --> 01:16:16,000
Don't tell anyone, but I think
E.J.'s moving back to New York.

1335
01:16:16,035 --> 01:16:20,000
It would be a lot more money,
a high-profile

1336
01:16:20,035 --> 01:16:22,000
It's a fantastic opportunity, E.J.

1337
01:16:22,035 --> 01:16:25,000
I mean, your job is is done here:::

1338
01:16:25,035 --> 01:16:29,000
and it's exactly what you've been waiting for.

1339
01:16:29,035 --> 01:16:31,000
Yeah, I've been thinking about it.

1340
01:16:31,035 --> 01:16:33,000
And I'd feeI I I don't know

1341
01:16:33,035 --> 01:16:35,000
uh, guilty for leaving...

1342
01:16:35,035 --> 01:16:38,000
before the publicity campaign
for the calendar is fully launched.

1343
01:16:38,035 --> 01:16:42,000
And I know I'd miss all my friends
at the rescue squad people I've met.

1344
01:16:42,035 --> 01:16:44,000
Well, I'm sure we'd miss you.

1345
01:16:44,035 --> 01:16:51,000
But we all know what
you had to give up to come here.

1346
01:16:51,035 --> 01:16:56,000
I suppose everybody would get along
just fine without me.

1347
01:16:56,035 --> 01:17:02,000
I can hardly expect them
to chain me down and force me to stay.

1348
01:17:02,035 --> 01:17:06,000
Exactly. You can't force people
to do something they can't do...

1349
01:17:06,035 --> 01:17:10,000
no matter how much you want 'em to.

1350
01:17:10,035 --> 01:17:15,000
You understand that, don't you?

1351
01:17:15,035 --> 01:17:21,000
I understand that perfectly.
People are who they are.

1352
01:17:21,035 --> 01:17:24,000
Right. And you know who I am.

1353
01:17:24,035 --> 01:17:28,000
I'm the player who dumped
his fiancee at the altar.

1354
01:17:28,035 --> 01:17:32,000
Now on a mission to bone and disown
every woman in the state.

1355
01:17:32,035 --> 01:17:44,000
Thanks for living up to your reputation.

1356
01:18:04,035 --> 01:18:07,000
Hello, Lillah, it's E.J.

1357
01:18:07,035 --> 01:18:11,000
Yes, could I start before Thanksgiving?
I want to hit the ground running.

1358
01:18:11,035 --> 01:18:18,000
Yep.

1359
01:18:18,035 --> 01:18:21,000
I am happy to announce that,
thanks to calendar sales:::

1360
01:18:21,035 --> 01:18:24,000
we expect to earn enough
for a new helicopter by New Year's.

1361
01:18:24,035 --> 01:18:26,000
And that's just the beginning.

1362
01:18:26,035 --> 01:18:28,000
We didn't do it to become famous.

1363
01:18:28,035 --> 01:18:31,000
We did it to show people that we care about
the search and rescue squad.

1364
01:18:31,035 --> 01:18:34,000
Now, truthfully, I'm a little worried
that staring at me for 30 days...

1365
01:18:34,035 --> 01:18:38,000
will send women into wild fits of passion,
but maybe that's not so bad.

1366
01:18:38,035 --> 01:18:43,000
It's all for the good of the town.

1367
01:18:46,035 --> 01:18:50,000
Taxil

1368
01:18:50,035 --> 01:18:52,000
I've gotten four phone calls
just this morning...

1369
01:18:52,035 --> 01:18:56,000
from companies wanting to have
their corporate retreats here.

1370
01:18:56,035 --> 01:18:59,000
Mmm. Too bad E.J.'s not here to see this.

1371
01:18:59,035 --> 01:19:03,000
Friday night? Let me see.

1372
01:19:03,035 --> 01:19:06,000
Yeah, I think Friday night could work.

1373
01:19:06,035 --> 01:19:08,000
Okay.

1374
01:19:08,035 --> 01:19:11,000
All right.

1375
01:19:11,035 --> 01:19:21,000
I'll see you then. Bye.

1376
01:19:21,035 --> 01:19:25,000
- Bob said Jan got a call from some Hollywood producers.
- Mmm.

1377
01:19:25,035 --> 01:19:28,000
Well, I think, uh, Matthew McConaughey's
gonna have to play me.

1378
01:19:28,035 --> 01:19:30,000
You know I love you more
than anything in the world, right?

1379
01:19:30,035 --> 01:19:39,000
But if Matthew McConaughey
plays you, I'm gonna play me.

1380
01:19:47,035 --> 01:19:52,000
# I still see your name
Still see your face #

1381
01:19:52,035 --> 01:19:57,000
# Remember the times
Still feel the trace #

1382
01:19:57,035 --> 01:20:06,000
# Of your perfume
walking out the door #

1383
01:20:06,035 --> 01:20:08,000
# I been livin'in my head #

1384
01:20:08,035 --> 01:20:14,000
# I can't get my feet
on the floor #

1385
01:20:14,035 --> 01:20:16,000
# I been livin'in my head #

1386
01:20:16,035 --> 01:20:19,000
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas!

1387
01:20:19,035 --> 01:20:21,000
- Why are you acting like a tourist?
- I'm sorry.

1388
01:20:21,035 --> 01:20:25,000
Did I tell you about the condo Howie saw
in Tribeca? Two bedrooms, three baths.

1389
01:20:25,035 --> 01:20:28,000
And the kitchen is nicer
than the one I have at home.

1390
01:20:28,035 --> 01:20:30,000
Not that I would know
how to use anything in it. Hmm.

1391
01:20:30,035 --> 01:20:33,000
- How much?
- 4.9 miI.

1392
01:20:33,035 --> 01:20:37,000
All this for $525 a month?

1393
01:20:37,035 --> 01:20:39,000
Is that too much?

1394
01:20:39,035 --> 01:20:42,000
I'll take it.

1395
01:20:42,035 --> 01:20:46,000
You will?
Well, we were gonna make an offer.

1396
01:20:46,035 --> 01:20:50,000
- But if you if you really want it
- Want what?

1397
01:20:50,035 --> 01:20:55,000
- The condo?
- Oh. Uh, 4.9? Are you insane?

1398
01:20:55,035 --> 01:20:58,000
Perhaps. I forgot to refill my PaxiI.

1399
01:20:58,035 --> 01:21:01,000
Oh, honey, this place is sensationaI.

1400
01:21:01,035 --> 01:21:05,000
Oh. There's no sign on the door. It takes
'em a week to answer their unlisted number.

1401
01:21:05,035 --> 01:21:09,000
Stop it. Stop it.

1402
01:21:09,035 --> 01:21:12,000
Mother of pearI.

1403
01:21:12,035 --> 01:21:17,000
Oh. We should get one and just sniff it.

1404
01:21:17,035 --> 01:21:20,000
I'm guessing people here
really get into eating carbs.

1405
01:21:20,035 --> 01:21:25,000
Yeah. They passed a law.

1406
01:21:25,035 --> 01:21:28,000
Ugh. And I begged him,
Please play with the other dogs. "

1407
01:21:28,035 --> 01:21:31,000
But he wouldn't. That's my fault. My fault.

1408
01:21:31,035 --> 01:21:33,000
I should've made more play dates
for him when he was little.

1409
01:21:33,035 --> 01:21:36,000
And he wouldn't have
so many socializing issues.

1410
01:21:36,035 --> 01:21:40,000
# I been livin'in my head #

1411
01:21:40,035 --> 01:21:43,000
- Where are you? Where are you?
- I'm sorry.

1412
01:21:43,035 --> 01:21:48,000
I know I'm not scintillating company.
Another Christmas alone.

1413
01:21:48,035 --> 01:21:54,000
- Honey:
- I can't get my feet on the floor

1414
01:21:54,035 --> 01:21:56,000
Give yourself some time, Emma Jane.

1415
01:21:56,035 --> 01:22:01,000
- I'm fine. Don't worry about me. I'm great.
- All right. All right.

1416
01:22:01,035 --> 01:22:03,000
- Did I say that with any sort of conviction?
- No.

1417
01:22:03,035 --> 01:22:07,000
I know it!

1418
01:22:07,035 --> 01:22:09,000
Don't forget this Sunday at 7:00 p. m...

1419
01:22:09,035 --> 01:22:14,000
the annuaI Christmas tree lighting
downtown on Main Street.

1420
01:22:14,035 --> 01:22:19,000
# I can't get my feet on the floor ##

1421
01:22:19,035 --> 01:22:22,000
- What?
- Hey, Will. It's me, Eric.

1422
01:22:22,035 --> 01:22:25,000
Climbers on Logan's Pass.
Teenagers, by the sound of it.

1423
01:22:25,035 --> 01:22:34,000
I'll be right there.

1424
01:22:34,035 --> 01:22:36,000
] Everybody knows
how delicious your chicken is:

1425
01:22:36,035 --> 01:22:39,000
And certainly our advertising campaign
will stress that.

1426
01:22:39,035 --> 01:22:42,000
But it is my job our job

1427
01:22:42,035 --> 01:22:46,000
to also begin to remove
the guilt of eating fast food...

1428
01:22:46,035 --> 01:22:49,000
with properly placed stories
that highlight consumer studies...

1429
01:22:49,035 --> 01:22:51,000
- that show the benefits of eating
- Excuse me.

1430
01:22:51,035 --> 01:22:54,000
- E.J., it's for you on six.
- She'll call back.

1431
01:22:54,035 --> 01:22:55,000
She said it was urgent.

1432
01:22:55,035 --> 01:23:00,000
Uh Okay. I'm sorry. Excuse me.

1433
01:23:00,035 --> 01:23:02,000
I'm sorry. One minute.

1434
01:23:02,035 --> 01:23:05,000
E.J. Baxter.

1435
01:23:05,035 --> 01:23:09,000
It's Jan. I'm really sorry to bother you.

1436
01:23:09,035 --> 01:23:11,000
Kind of in a meeting right now.
Can I call you back?

1437
01:23:11,035 --> 01:23:15,000
I've got some really bad news.
You might want to sit down.

1438
01:23:15,035 --> 01:23:19,000
- Why? What happened?
- Will's been in a bad accident.

1439
01:23:19,035 --> 01:23:21,000
He fell 50 feet during a rescue mission.

1440
01:23:21,035 --> 01:23:23,000
He's in Kalispell RegionaI.

1441
01:23:23,035 --> 01:23:28,000
- Is he going to be all right?
- They don't know.

1442
01:23:28,035 --> 01:23:30,000
I really think you should come out here.

1443
01:23:30,035 --> 01:23:37,000
I'm the last person he wants to see.

1444
01:23:37,035 --> 01:23:39,000
You probably don't want to hear this...

1445
01:23:39,035 --> 01:23:43,000
but Eric finally told me
that Will didn't walk out on his fiancee.

1446
01:23:43,035 --> 01:23:45,000
She walked out on him after he found out...

1447
01:23:45,035 --> 01:23:48,000
she slept with Jason
the night before their wedding.

1448
01:23:48,035 --> 01:23:53,000
He begged her to stay, and she left him,
which is why he couldn't ask you to stay.

1449
01:23:53,035 --> 01:23:55,000
- So what you're saying is
- Darlingl

1450
01:23:55,035 --> 01:23:59,000
Let's go. Okay? Everybody's got planes
to catch and places to go, right?

1451
01:23:59,035 --> 01:24:01,000
Love to, Lillah, but I can't.

1452
01:24:01,035 --> 01:24:04,000
I have a plane to catch too.

1453
01:24:04,035 --> 01:24:07,000
- Have you gone insane?
- Probably.

1454
01:24:07,035 --> 01:24:19,000
What?

1455
01:24:32,035 --> 01:24:34,000
Can I help you?

1456
01:24:34,035 --> 01:24:37,000
Yes. Can you please tell me
where the person is that was in this room?

1457
01:24:37,035 --> 01:24:53,000
He's gone.

1458
01:24:53,035 --> 01:24:54,000
Will. Wha

1459
01:24:54,035 --> 01:24:57,000
What are you doing here? I mean, I-I-I

1460
01:24:57,035 --> 01:25:01,000
I forgot something.

1461
01:25:01,035 --> 01:25:21,000
So did I.

1462
01:25:21,035 --> 01:25:25,000
Merry Christmas to me.

1463
01:25:25,035 --> 01:25:35,000
Mr. December is no longer available.

1464
01:25:35,035 --> 01:25:39,000
# Then a little white snow starts to fall #

1465
01:25:39,035 --> 01:25:45,000
