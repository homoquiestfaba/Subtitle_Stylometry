1
00:05:43,706 --> 00:05:47,971
You know when you are sure
about something and you just know it?

2
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:51,475
And you can't stop thinking about it?

3
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:58,822
Lilly Swanson...

4
00:06:02,935 --> 00:06:05,771
...would you like to marry me?

5
00:06:15,523 --> 00:06:17,942
See the top of that hill, Lily?
Yeah.

6
00:06:18,867 --> 00:06:21,302
We'll build you a house
up there up there one day.

7
00:06:21,303 --> 00:06:26,624
Come on Lilly, we got a whole life
to explore, just you and I.

8
00:07:27,538 --> 00:07:28,098
Hi there!

9
00:07:28,138 --> 00:07:30,291
Hi. Can I get a table for one please.

10
00:07:34,128 --> 00:07:34,889
Here you go.

11
00:07:34,929 --> 00:07:35,930
Thank You.

12
00:07:48,338 --> 00:07:50,337
Hey there, what can I get ya?

13
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:56,539
May I have the blueberry pancakes
and some orange juice.

14
00:07:59,088 --> 00:08:01,086
Got it. Be back in a little.

15
00:08:02,087 --> 00:08:03,087
Thank you.

16
00:08:24,364 --> 00:08:25,955
Need some pancakes.

17
00:08:27,611 --> 00:08:28,860
Pancakes coming up.

18
00:08:35,387 --> 00:08:36,888
Here you go.
Thank you.

19
00:08:37,665 --> 00:08:39,916
Sorry, miss. You look kind of familiar.

20
00:08:40,449 --> 00:08:42,198
Are you on TV or something like that?

21
00:08:43,434 --> 00:08:44,504
No.

22
00:08:45,569 --> 00:08:48,350
All right. Sorry to bug ya.

23
00:08:59,030 --> 00:09:00,280
Oh Shit...

24
00:09:01,977 --> 00:09:02,971
Oh, my God! No!

25
00:09:05,484 --> 00:09:06,192
Shit!

26
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:11,381
Oh fuck! ohhhh fuck! Damnit!

27
00:09:14,322 --> 00:09:15,821
Oh my God!

28
00:09:16,209 --> 00:09:18,973
They're coming. There coming.
How was your weekend?

29
00:09:19,578 --> 00:09:20,630
Good.

30
00:09:21,573 --> 00:09:22,028
Oh yeah?

31
00:10:02,357 --> 00:10:03,606
Shit, I'm hungry.

32
00:11:58,431 --> 00:11:59,580
Hey, Cindy.

33
00:12:00,236 --> 00:12:02,947
It's me again.

34
00:12:03,595 --> 00:12:05,991
I'm trying to reach you.

35
00:12:07,735 --> 00:12:11,997
Well, I'm kind of in a bind here, so...

36
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:18,003
I don't know, when you get a chance,
can you call me back?

37
00:14:17,757 --> 00:14:19,007
Hi!
How are you doing, sir?

38
00:14:19,008 --> 00:14:21,257
Excellent, excellent.
What can I get for you?

39
00:14:21,282 --> 00:14:26,258
Well, the baby is a little bit thirsty.
So, let's stick 40 in it.

40
00:14:26,708 --> 00:14:27,758
Got it.
All right.

41
00:14:41,503 --> 00:14:45,699
Didn't I see you hitchhiking
up the road there?

42
00:14:47,194 --> 00:14:49,645
It's probably not a very safe
thing to be doing, you know.

43
00:14:49,818 --> 00:14:53,069
Yeah. I know that, I guess I didn't expect
my car to die on me, did I?

44
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:57,240
So where are you headed?

45
00:14:59,358 --> 00:15:01,358
Don't know, I'm looking for a job I guess.

46
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:03,060
A job?

47
00:15:04,212 --> 00:15:05,762
What kind of job are you looking for?

48
00:15:07,025 --> 00:15:11,235
Anything really, I'm looking to start
fresh somewhere new, that's all.

49
00:15:11,489 --> 00:15:14,989
You know, I need a young guy who can
help me get my business off the ground.

50
00:15:16,109 --> 00:15:18,301
Is that something you
might be interested in?

51
00:15:18,699 --> 00:15:19,090
Maybe.

52
00:15:20,417 --> 00:15:23,862
Okay, well listen, I just opened up
a new casino in Sparks.

53
00:15:23,993 --> 00:15:24,998
Sparks, eh? Where is that?

54
00:15:25,523 --> 00:15:28,659
About 50 miles up the road.
And it's where everything is happening.

55
00:15:30,554 --> 00:15:34,045
And if you're looking for opportunity,
Sparks is where you need to be.

56
00:15:36,194 --> 00:15:37,245
Okay.

57
00:15:39,850 --> 00:15:43,099
And opportunity is what I'm offering you.

58
00:15:46,044 --> 00:15:47,143
Really?

59
00:15:50,134 --> 00:15:51,384
What's your name?

60
00:15:51,816 --> 00:15:52,816
Zane.

61
00:15:53,134 --> 00:15:54,134
Morris.

62
00:15:54,987 --> 00:15:57,100
I need a young kid, a young guy...

63
00:15:58,370 --> 00:15:59,384
who could work hard...

64
00:16:00,884 --> 00:16:02,884
...and who wants to make a lot of money.

65
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:15,567
I guess I don't really have
anywhere else to go.

66
00:16:15,768 --> 00:16:16,285
Okay, I'm in.

67
00:16:16,325 --> 00:16:19,285
Great! Pick that thing up
and let's get out of here.

68
00:16:30,766 --> 00:16:32,016
Is that car yours?

69
00:16:32,017 --> 00:16:34,462
My Baby. Take real good care of her.

70
00:16:34,742 --> 00:16:37,300
Yeah, I bet you do, she is a real beauty.

71
00:16:38,711 --> 00:16:42,533
I take better care of this car
than most of the women in my life.

72
00:16:45,167 --> 00:16:49,235
Come on Zane, hop in.
I'll take you for a ride.

73
00:17:01,508 --> 00:17:03,007
You like that?
Sure do, Morris.

74
00:17:05,954 --> 00:17:07,579
Off we go.

75
00:17:11,592 --> 00:17:13,292
So, here it is, kid.

76
00:17:13,742 --> 00:17:15,741
The cream of my empire.

77
00:17:17,657 --> 00:17:20,462
Morris, you own this place?

78
00:17:20,502 --> 00:17:22,905
The whole goddamn place.

79
00:17:22,906 --> 00:17:25,655
It's very, very impressive, Morris.

80
00:17:26,350 --> 00:17:27,014
It should be.

81
00:17:28,973 --> 00:17:30,474
How is the business here?

82
00:17:31,132 --> 00:17:34,132
It's good, but it can always be better.

83
00:17:35,206 --> 00:17:36,833
That's why I have the other place, Zane.

84
00:17:37,722 --> 00:17:42,296
Hey Morris, if you ever need help
one day I'd love to help out.

85
00:17:43,126 --> 00:17:46,419
Well, if you play your cards right,

86
00:17:46,748 --> 00:17:48,287
...do good for the other clubs,

87
00:17:50,402 --> 00:17:51,903
who knows?

88
00:17:52,139 --> 00:17:55,510
Some day you might be running
the whole damn place.

89
00:17:56,628 --> 00:17:58,628
Shall we go check it out?

90
00:17:58,850 --> 00:18:00,850
Ever been in a casino before?
No, sir.

91
00:18:02,210 --> 00:18:04,011
You've never been in a casino before?

92
00:18:05,517 --> 00:18:07,669
Then let me introduce you...

93
00:18:08,537 --> 00:18:13,787
...to the world of casinos, Mr Zane.

94
00:20:19,968 --> 00:20:22,196
What can I get for you?
Can I get a shot of whiskey?

95
00:20:25,145 --> 00:20:26,779
Thank you.

96
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:31,797
Hey.
Hi.

97
00:20:34,110 --> 00:20:36,228
Care if I bum a cigarette off you?

98
00:20:51,730 --> 00:20:53,424
So, where are you from, girl?

99
00:20:57,407 --> 00:20:59,753
It's a place called Heavenly Valley.

100
00:21:00,664 --> 00:21:02,129
Heavenly Valley, hey?

101
00:21:03,693 --> 00:21:05,145
Guess it's your lucky night.

102
00:21:05,987 --> 00:21:07,217
Why is that?

103
00:21:08,062 --> 00:21:11,065
I kinda have a soft spot
for angels like yourself.

104
00:21:14,233 --> 00:21:17,684
Well, I kind of have a thing for
handsome devils like yourself.

105
00:22:59,958 --> 00:23:02,639
So, did I get to see
the devil in Miss Lynn last night?

106
00:23:03,664 --> 00:23:06,083
What do you think?

107
00:23:14,515 --> 00:23:16,493
So, how does a little
breakfast sound like, huh?

108
00:23:17,467 --> 00:23:19,191
Sounds perfect.

109
00:23:20,768 --> 00:23:22,512
I like this painting.

110
00:23:25,218 --> 00:23:27,095
Got it from my aunt over in El Reno.

111
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:28,310
Reno?

112
00:23:28,457 --> 00:23:29,905
Like horses, hey?

113
00:23:30,948 --> 00:23:33,492
Yeah, I guess I could say that.

114
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:36,111
Hey, hey.

115
00:23:36,628 --> 00:23:37,887
Everything all right?

116
00:23:39,427 --> 00:23:40,476
Yeah.

117
00:23:45,464 --> 00:23:49,772
So, why don't you make yourself
at home, I'll go get some breakfast.

118
00:23:50,926 --> 00:23:51,991
Okay.

119
00:24:09,883 --> 00:24:13,731
Where does miss Lynn come from?

120
00:24:13,771 --> 00:24:16,100
I'm from Sacramento actually.

121
00:24:16,692 --> 00:24:18,957
Cali girl, hey?
Yep.

122
00:24:19,407 --> 00:24:20,407
It's funny.

123
00:24:21,715 --> 00:24:23,536
I always wanted to go to California.

124
00:24:24,642 --> 00:24:25,753
You've never been?

125
00:24:26,199 --> 00:24:29,753
Never. You know one day
if I make enough money.

126
00:24:30,713 --> 00:24:33,450
Well, one day I'll take you.

127
00:24:34,427 --> 00:24:37,132
Yeah, sounds like a plan.

128
00:24:38,369 --> 00:24:41,192
So, where are you from, Zane?

129
00:24:43,768 --> 00:24:46,765
Well, I'm an army brat.

130
00:24:46,959 --> 00:24:51,749
My dad is actually an army preacher
and we moved a lot.

131
00:24:52,928 --> 00:24:57,476
So, I guess you can say
I don't really have home town.

132
00:24:57,672 --> 00:24:58,892
That's kind of funny actually.

133
00:25:00,450 --> 00:25:01,550
How so?

134
00:25:02,714 --> 00:25:05,545
Well, I just wouldn't have pegged you
for a preacher's son.

135
00:25:09,074 --> 00:25:13,287
Well, I guess you can say I've lost my way.

136
00:25:15,025 --> 00:25:17,781
Or maybe you just haven't found it yet.

137
00:25:19,195 --> 00:25:22,911
Hey, I hope you are right there, Miss Lynn.

138
00:25:25,759 --> 00:25:27,429
So, how did you end up here?

139
00:25:28,554 --> 00:25:32,350
Well, it was kind of a toss up
between El Reno and Sparks,

140
00:25:32,608 --> 00:25:36,610
I flipped a coin and you can guess
the rest of the story.

141
00:25:38,610 --> 00:25:40,622
So, you left it up to chance, hey?

142
00:25:41,363 --> 00:25:42,428
Yeah.

143
00:25:43,256 --> 00:25:44,463
No.

144
00:25:45,278 --> 00:25:46,905
I actually had the time on my own.

145
00:25:47,694 --> 00:25:52,098
Couldn't afford a bus ticket to
Los Angeles, so ended up here.

146
00:25:54,473 --> 00:25:58,294
And what may I ask do you do
for a living, Mr Zane?

147
00:26:00,491 --> 00:26:05,798
I work at this new lounge that just
opened up, Horseshoe lounge.

148
00:26:06,085 --> 00:26:07,387
Horseshoe, eh?

149
00:26:09,186 --> 00:26:11,647
Yeah, I work the bar.

150
00:26:12,237 --> 00:26:13,620
Do some security work.

151
00:26:14,225 --> 00:26:16,686
- So, you work late nights?
- Yeah.

152
00:26:21,328 --> 00:26:25,420
And I also own a small side business.

153
00:26:25,479 --> 00:26:27,308
And what's that about?

154
00:26:30,046 --> 00:26:31,329
Well...

155
00:26:33,695 --> 00:26:38,339
...I have a little candy shop that caters
to the citizens here in Sparks.

156
00:26:39,993 --> 00:26:42,926
And what kind of candy
do you keep in your candy shop?

157
00:26:43,718 --> 00:26:45,863
Would you like to try some, little girl?

158
00:26:47,806 --> 00:26:49,742
Only if it's sweet.

159
00:26:54,262 --> 00:26:56,203
A bit early in the morning.

160
00:27:04,705 --> 00:27:06,189
But trust me.

161
00:27:06,442 --> 00:27:12,469
This is the sweetest
candy you'll ever have.

162
00:27:15,892 --> 00:27:19,202
Zane, I don't...

163
00:27:19,942 --> 00:27:23,362
I don't think I can.

164
00:27:26,487 --> 00:27:31,227
Come on, try it, you'll like it.

165
00:27:32,117 --> 00:27:35,365
I've never done this kind of candy before.

166
00:27:36,299 --> 00:27:38,155
Hey, come on.

167
00:30:15,745 --> 00:30:17,872
What's that?

168
00:30:18,095 --> 00:30:21,223
Nothing really, just always
wanted to see the Ocean.

169
00:30:21,710 --> 00:30:23,866
That makes the two of us actually.

170
00:30:24,234 --> 00:30:26,004
Never been?
Never.

171
00:30:26,504 --> 00:30:31,378
My mom nearly drowned as a kid and
she swore she'd never take us back.

172
00:30:32,310 --> 00:30:34,861
Hey, one day.

173
00:30:38,672 --> 00:30:40,554
So, how is your mom?

174
00:30:44,219 --> 00:30:47,369
She's not well actually.

175
00:30:48,861 --> 00:30:53,199
She had a nervous breakdown
when my dad passed away and...

176
00:30:54,245 --> 00:30:57,020
...she's under a lot of medication.

177
00:30:57,196 --> 00:31:01,782
Well, it's a long sad story.

178
00:31:04,546 --> 00:31:08,110
Hey, you'll be all right.

179
00:31:10,897 --> 00:31:15,713
Well, yeah, I just prefer not to talk
about it, you know.

180
00:31:15,955 --> 00:31:18,965
Yeah, I hear ya...

181
00:32:17,885 --> 00:32:19,564
Hi Alex... how are things here?

182
00:32:19,589 --> 00:32:20,641
Finding some rest.

183
00:32:20,666 --> 00:32:21,583
Good?

184
00:32:21,608 --> 00:32:22,580
Yeah.

185
00:32:22,605 --> 00:32:23,612
Def...

186
00:32:23,637 --> 00:32:26,266
Yeah, a lot of people winning,
screaming, you know

187
00:32:26,798 --> 00:32:29,383
All the same, the usual.
The usual. The usual.

188
00:32:29,408 --> 00:32:31,702
All right, see you around.
All right.

189
00:32:31,727 --> 00:32:32,728
How ya doing?

190
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:36,556
Pretty good?
Just waiting to get paid.

191
00:32:36,581 --> 00:32:38,708
What did you do? Hit a jackpot?

192
00:32:38,733 --> 00:32:40,242
A small one.

193
00:32:40,448 --> 00:32:43,034
Yeah, that is a small one, but it's nice.

194
00:32:45,355 --> 00:32:48,858
Thanks Samuel, how are you doing?

195
00:32:51,334 --> 00:32:52,872
Hi how are you doing this evening?

196
00:32:52,897 --> 00:32:53,938
Hi, how are you?

197
00:32:53,963 --> 00:32:55,941
I'm good, how is everything going?

198
00:32:55,966 --> 00:32:57,710
Great, thank you.

199
00:32:57,735 --> 00:32:59,411
Let me know if you need anything.

200
00:32:59,436 --> 00:33:01,543
I sure will, darling,
you have a good evening.

201
00:33:57,910 --> 00:34:01,206
So, got a plan for you, Chloe.

202
00:34:01,828 --> 00:34:03,587
Oh yeah? And what's that?

203
00:34:04,477 --> 00:34:09,873
Well, you got a job offer
if you are interested.

204
00:34:11,162 --> 00:34:13,124
I'm interested.

205
00:34:15,381 --> 00:34:19,214
It's with a place I work at,

206
00:34:20,538 --> 00:34:24,075
a couple of cocktail waitresses
have recently left the club.

207
00:34:24,718 --> 00:34:27,247
Moving on to greener pastures, I guess.

208
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:33,586
And Morris, the owner, is looking for
some fresh faces to fill in his roster.

209
00:34:34,912 --> 00:34:39,397
So, I told him that I stumbled
across this fairy that...

210
00:34:40,482 --> 00:34:42,920
...landed on my lap the other night
at the bar, and...

211
00:34:43,729 --> 00:34:46,273
Well, that's when I dropped your name.

212
00:34:46,567 --> 00:34:48,258
What's the pay like?

213
00:34:48,629 --> 00:34:51,218
It's okay for the job and...

214
00:34:52,417 --> 00:34:56,589
It would be nice if we were
a two-income household now...

215
00:34:57,915 --> 00:35:00,884
...since business is, well,
a little slow right now.

216
00:35:03,340 --> 00:35:04,800
Hey, what do you think?

217
00:35:06,076 --> 00:35:09,873
I think that's a great idea.
Let's cheers to that.

218
00:35:23,548 --> 00:35:24,765
So, how did it go?

219
00:35:25,273 --> 00:35:26,816
Took me to the cleaners on this one.

220
00:35:28,171 --> 00:35:30,957
That new club better start
paying some of its bills.

221
00:35:31,449 --> 00:35:35,081
This might have been a gamble
I wasn't exactly expecting.

222
00:35:35,559 --> 00:35:36,963
I thought business was good.

223
00:35:37,889 --> 00:35:40,680
It is. It can always be better.

224
00:35:41,401 --> 00:35:44,967
And that dealer kid... Charlie.

225
00:35:44,992 --> 00:35:46,860
Charlie, yeah... little fucker.

226
00:35:47,331 --> 00:35:50,025
Stealing all that cash last month
really put a crimp in my ass.

227
00:35:50,050 --> 00:35:51,937
You know, I never had a
good feeling about him.

228
00:35:51,962 --> 00:35:54,799
He was always so nervous, shifty.

229
00:35:55,333 --> 00:35:58,995
Well, he was good at his job.

230
00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:04,162
Well... I just didn't see that one coming.

231
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:07,236
That's what you got me for, remember?
Yeah.

232
00:36:07,351 --> 00:36:09,228
Which reminds me, this new kid of yours...

233
00:36:10,268 --> 00:36:12,937
Zane, can't be trusted either.

234
00:36:12,962 --> 00:36:15,083
I'd keep an eye on him and his girlfriend.

235
00:36:15,108 --> 00:36:18,641
Oh, come on Bruno, he's a good kid,
he reminds me of my son.

236
00:36:18,666 --> 00:36:21,937
Yeah, but there is something else going
on with him, I don't know what it is yet.

237
00:36:21,962 --> 00:36:24,042
But my gut tells me he's hiding something.

238
00:36:24,107 --> 00:36:26,140
I can see it in his eyes.

239
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:28,140
Well then, you see something I don't.

240
00:36:29,892 --> 00:36:33,103
Don't worry about it.
I got your back on this, boss.

241
00:36:33,128 --> 00:36:36,162
All right, well, let's go over here
to Salles and grab a bite.

242
00:36:37,057 --> 00:36:37,975
Sounds good to me.

243
00:36:40,034 --> 00:36:41,922
So how much money did you win?

244
00:36:43,559 --> 00:36:45,321
The question is how much
money did I lose?

245
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:50,042
I thought you said the question was how much
money did you win, so what did you win?

246
00:36:50,121 --> 00:36:51,265
Five bucks.

247
00:36:51,290 --> 00:36:53,135
So, how much did you lose?
20.

248
00:36:53,376 --> 00:36:55,246
Shit, take it to the bank.

249
00:36:56,448 --> 00:36:57,866
I will.

250
00:36:58,127 --> 00:37:00,812
So, did you take care
of those girls for me?

251
00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:02,489
I did, I did.

252
00:37:03,398 --> 00:37:05,978
You did?
Yes, no more problem with that.

253
00:37:06,158 --> 00:37:08,987
I had a little problem
at the bar tonight.

254
00:37:09,189 --> 00:37:10,209
What?

255
00:37:11,852 --> 00:37:13,298
I had to fire Vanessa.

256
00:37:14,364 --> 00:37:15,485
Why?

257
00:37:16,739 --> 00:37:18,254
Giving away free drinks again.

258
00:37:19,030 --> 00:37:20,105
Shit!

259
00:37:50,482 --> 00:37:53,748
Bruno? Me, Morris.

260
00:37:53,992 --> 00:37:55,250
Yeah, I know.

261
00:37:56,411 --> 00:38:02,254
Hey, I wanna know why those receipts
are all fucked up at the Horseshoe again.

262
00:38:06,536 --> 00:38:09,379
Then I'm gonna have Johnny boy
and the crew...

263
00:38:09,485 --> 00:38:12,381
...go over and take
a little visit to Steve.

264
00:38:12,406 --> 00:38:15,635
Because he hasn't made good
on one fucking dime.

265
00:38:19,658 --> 00:38:20,681
All right.

266
00:39:01,286 --> 00:39:02,162
Hey!

267
00:39:03,594 --> 00:39:04,660
Guys, I don't have any money.

268
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:07,350
Yeah, you look broke.

269
00:39:08,271 --> 00:39:09,392
Almost.

270
00:39:09,432 --> 00:39:12,364
We saw you at a casino, didn't look you
were doing too well there either.

271
00:39:12,619 --> 00:39:15,194
No, I had a bad night, I bled
a little more money than usual.

272
00:39:15,489 --> 00:39:17,538
Well, we know that,
that's why we are here to help.

273
00:39:18,225 --> 00:39:19,345
I don't need help.

274
00:39:19,605 --> 00:39:21,420
Hey, listen.

275
00:39:22,737 --> 00:39:24,644
My brother said we are here to help.

276
00:39:24,883 --> 00:39:27,627
No, really, I don't need help.
Just hear us out.

277
00:39:33,364 --> 00:39:34,723
Open up, Zane!

278
00:39:35,004 --> 00:39:36,526
I know you're in there, man.
Lights are on.

279
00:39:45,044 --> 00:39:47,263
Come on, Zane! Open the door, man.

280
00:39:48,903 --> 00:39:50,825
Come on Zane, let's go, no games.

281
00:39:56,659 --> 00:39:58,964
Let's go Zane,
I don't want to play this game!

282
00:40:03,124 --> 00:40:05,390
See you soon.
See you tomorrow, man.

283
00:40:19,363 --> 00:40:21,410
Hey, Zane you had visitors the other day.

284
00:40:22,482 --> 00:40:23,008
Really?

285
00:40:24,974 --> 00:40:26,995
Yeah, a couple of guys with black beanies.

286
00:40:28,029 --> 00:40:30,303
They looked kind of scary,
are they friends of yours?

287
00:40:31,131 --> 00:40:31,733
No.

288
00:40:34,372 --> 00:40:35,546
Well, who are they?

289
00:40:41,716 --> 00:40:43,713
Something I don't need
to deal with right now.

290
00:40:48,173 --> 00:40:52,259
Listen Chloe, steer clear from those two
until I figure something out, okay?

291
00:41:00,954 --> 00:41:02,072
Morning, Bruno.

292
00:41:04,629 --> 00:41:06,627
So, how are things today?

293
00:41:06,853 --> 00:41:07,923
Morning, Boss.

294
00:41:08,381 --> 00:41:12,290
Okay, just surfing the net.

295
00:41:15,238 --> 00:41:16,536
Well, can I have my seat please?!

296
00:41:16,801 --> 00:41:17,819
Whoa!!!

297
00:41:18,147 --> 00:41:19,168
What flew up your ass today?

298
00:41:21,268 --> 00:41:22,892
Not a goddamn thing.

299
00:41:23,626 --> 00:41:25,703
Couldn't sleep a wink last night.

300
00:41:26,704 --> 00:41:32,161
And I got a fucking hangover,
you just can't believe.

301
00:41:32,348 --> 00:41:35,564
Had a little blonde last night
that wouldn't let me sleep a wink.

302
00:41:35,604 --> 00:41:36,946
You know what I'm saying?

303
00:41:37,621 --> 00:41:38,801
Son of a bitch.

304
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:47,584
So, you want a drink?

305
00:41:48,229 --> 00:41:49,622
It's early!

306
00:41:51,999 --> 00:41:53,838
What the hell... sure!

307
00:41:58,338 --> 00:42:03,604
Ya know I think I may have just found
something that will brighten your day.

308
00:42:07,099 --> 00:42:08,577
Godamn it Bruno!

309
00:42:09,624 --> 00:42:10,955
It better be good.

310
00:42:11,804 --> 00:42:15,258
Because the last Godamn time you
found something on the Internet,

311
00:42:15,298 --> 00:42:16,992
all it was was your fucking porn.

312
00:42:18,786 --> 00:42:19,891
Yep...

313
00:42:20,359 --> 00:42:22,048
but this time...

314
00:42:25,676 --> 00:42:27,511
Its different.

315
00:42:29,961 --> 00:42:33,965
What the fuck?!

316
00:42:35,882 --> 00:42:39,965
What the fuck Bruno is this?!

317
00:42:39,990 --> 00:42:44,472
Just one of those smutty little sites
that you love so much.

318
00:42:44,884 --> 00:42:46,260
Fuck you.

319
00:42:51,638 --> 00:42:53,264
Well...

320
00:42:56,142 --> 00:42:58,311
Our sweet little Chloe...

321
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:03,718
...has a side of her that...

322
00:43:05,066 --> 00:43:07,266
...we haven't seen before.

323
00:43:56,119 --> 00:43:59,940
Mr Zane, just the guy we were looking for.

324
00:43:59,965 --> 00:44:02,427
Why don't you take a little walk with us?

325
00:44:14,002 --> 00:44:16,235
Zane? Zane?

326
00:44:16,529 --> 00:44:18,157
Oh, my God, Zane?

327
00:44:18,182 --> 00:44:19,766
Zane, what did they do to you?

328
00:44:21,066 --> 00:44:22,692
I got whooped, Chloe.

329
00:44:23,156 --> 00:44:26,262
The beanie brothers are getting impatient.

330
00:44:26,287 --> 00:44:28,947
Oh baby, that looks really deep,
we need to get you to hospital.

331
00:44:28,972 --> 00:44:30,362
I can't do that right now.

332
00:44:30,904 --> 00:44:33,061
What do you mean?
I just can't.

333
00:44:34,757 --> 00:44:37,385
Okay baby, I'm gonna go
and get us some towels, okay?

334
00:44:37,410 --> 00:44:40,663
You just stay right there, okay?
You just stay right there.

335
00:44:57,638 --> 00:45:00,298
What are you going to do now?

336
00:45:01,642 --> 00:45:04,145
I'll figure it out.

337
00:45:11,903 --> 00:45:15,162
Are you sure you are all right?

338
00:45:20,286 --> 00:45:25,100
Hey babe, can you get me my painkillers?

339
00:45:25,125 --> 00:45:28,063
They are in the medicine cabinet.

340
00:45:28,360 --> 00:45:30,309
Yeah.

341
00:45:39,015 --> 00:45:40,478
Where?

342
00:45:40,563 --> 00:45:43,542
Behind the mouthwash bottle.

343
00:48:22,180 --> 00:48:24,044
What can I do for you, Zane?

344
00:48:27,842 --> 00:48:32,222
Morris, I need to borrow some money.

345
00:48:33,864 --> 00:48:35,449
For what?

346
00:48:36,939 --> 00:48:40,068
I got in deep with the Beanie brothers.

347
00:48:43,603 --> 00:48:46,157
So, you are telling me you got in deep
with the Beanie brothers...

348
00:48:46,182 --> 00:48:48,365
...and now you are coming to me
to clean up your mess?

349
00:48:48,390 --> 00:48:51,298
Yeah, Morris, you are the only one
I know I can turn to.

350
00:48:51,323 --> 00:48:53,823
Come on, you know I'm good for it.

351
00:48:54,463 --> 00:48:58,225
You are a funny guy, Zane,
and you got some funny habits.

352
00:48:58,857 --> 00:49:02,817
Listen, you can take it out off
Chloe's tips and I'll work double shifts.

353
00:49:02,842 --> 00:49:04,822
Anything, Morris please, it's real urgent!

354
00:49:12,375 --> 00:49:13,959
I think I have an idea.

355
00:49:14,813 --> 00:49:16,815
Now you listen to me good, Zane.

356
00:49:17,030 --> 00:49:18,719
You're gonna work double shifts...

357
00:49:19,991 --> 00:49:22,244
...until the money is paid back,
that's without saying.

358
00:49:23,158 --> 00:49:25,139
Chloe. Does she do favours?

359
00:49:26,542 --> 00:49:28,043
What do you mean favours?

360
00:49:29,469 --> 00:49:30,548
You heard me.

361
00:49:30,664 --> 00:49:33,208
Does she or doesn't she do favours?

362
00:49:33,300 --> 00:49:34,568
Like what?

363
00:49:38,879 --> 00:49:40,417
Oh, Zane.

364
00:49:41,289 --> 00:49:43,332
Chloe is a pretty little thing.

365
00:49:45,426 --> 00:49:47,099
But she's got another side.

366
00:49:47,125 --> 00:49:48,964
Hey, what are you talking about, Morris?

367
00:49:49,954 --> 00:49:53,742
You don't have to act like you don't know
what the hell I'm talking about.

368
00:49:55,443 --> 00:49:57,030
You've got to know.

369
00:50:02,475 --> 00:50:04,001
You really don't know?

370
00:50:06,442 --> 00:50:08,796
Oh, fuck.

371
00:50:12,943 --> 00:50:14,131
Well... take a look at this.

372
00:50:15,195 --> 00:50:19,880
www.heavenlyhottie.com.

373
00:50:20,717 --> 00:50:24,632
Little Miss Chloe is as
naughty as they get.

374
00:50:25,636 --> 00:50:28,451
You are a lucky boy, Zane.

375
00:50:32,643 --> 00:50:34,174
I can't believe it.

376
00:50:41,166 --> 00:50:42,716
You know, Zane,

377
00:50:44,630 --> 00:50:46,006
men like me...

378
00:50:47,721 --> 00:50:53,185
we like to dip into the fountain
of youth from time to time.

379
00:50:55,925 --> 00:50:58,090
You know what I'm saying, don't you?

380
00:50:58,240 --> 00:51:00,701
No, Morris, I don't.

381
00:51:01,413 --> 00:51:02,915
Look, Zane,

382
00:51:03,457 --> 00:51:04,850
you are in deep shit!

383
00:51:05,143 --> 00:51:09,491
As far as I know, you are in deeper
than you normally get.

384
00:51:10,187 --> 00:51:14,770
Now, I'm giving you way out of your mess.

385
00:51:16,047 --> 00:51:17,768
And as far as I'm concerned,

386
00:51:18,554 --> 00:51:23,501
Miss Chloe's time is interest on the money.

387
00:51:25,975 --> 00:51:29,431
You need to set up some quality time
between Little miss Chloe and I.

388
00:51:30,554 --> 00:51:32,890
Morris, I don't know, I...

389
00:51:33,310 --> 00:51:34,435
No.

390
00:51:34,901 --> 00:51:36,153
We have a deal?

391
00:51:37,532 --> 00:51:40,836
You either you make it happen or you don't.

392
00:51:46,214 --> 00:51:49,058
All right, Morris, it's a deal.

393
00:51:49,242 --> 00:51:51,681
Great, great!

394
00:51:52,372 --> 00:51:56,474
Now, if for some reason,

395
00:51:58,251 --> 00:52:02,663
you and Miss Chloe
can't work this out together,

396
00:52:05,491 --> 00:52:08,027
then I guess I'm gonna have to have
Johnny boy and his crew...

397
00:52:08,052 --> 00:52:10,221
...come over and visit you and...

398
00:52:10,377 --> 00:52:13,768
...take back my money and then some.

399
00:52:16,828 --> 00:52:21,080
Then I'm sure you remember
how that went for Steve, right?

400
00:52:23,841 --> 00:52:25,676
Yes, I remember.

401
00:52:29,612 --> 00:52:31,828
All right, so how much do you need?

402
00:52:32,051 --> 00:52:33,344
25 Gs.

403
00:52:35,644 --> 00:52:36,729
When do you need it by?

404
00:52:37,376 --> 00:52:39,783
Brothers need it by tomorrow.

405
00:52:40,132 --> 00:52:42,507
So, you need it right now?
Yeah.

406
00:52:52,489 --> 00:52:54,497
Goddamn you, Zane!

407
00:52:57,258 --> 00:53:02,566
You promise me you will never
get yourself in this deep again.

408
00:53:03,315 --> 00:53:05,692
Do you understand me?!

409
00:53:06,247 --> 00:53:09,208
I promise.

410
00:53:22,226 --> 00:53:25,739
Now I want you to make me
some special coupons...

411
00:53:26,801 --> 00:53:29,181
...for some special nights with Chloe.

412
00:53:30,689 --> 00:53:32,898
You can handle that, right?

413
00:53:34,741 --> 00:53:35,742
Zane?

414
00:53:38,108 --> 00:53:39,409
Zane! You can handle that right?

415
00:53:39,421 --> 00:53:41,971
Yes Morris, yes, I can!

416
00:53:43,367 --> 00:53:46,027
All right. We have a deal.

417
00:54:05,873 --> 00:54:09,724
There it is, 25 grand, count it.

418
00:54:26,229 --> 00:54:27,790
Zane?

419
00:54:32,610 --> 00:54:39,091
If you try to fucking bail with my money,

420
00:54:40,763 --> 00:54:45,894
there is going to be
serious consequences.

421
00:54:46,156 --> 00:54:49,034
I got you, Morris, okay?

422
00:54:53,217 --> 00:54:56,705
Now you go and make good
with the Beanie brothers.

423
00:54:58,470 --> 00:55:00,931
You honor your deal with me like a man.

424
00:55:01,995 --> 00:55:03,821
And none if this ever happened.

425
00:55:14,201 --> 00:55:15,549
And Zane?

426
00:55:17,885 --> 00:55:19,571
Tell Miss Chloe...

427
00:55:21,159 --> 00:55:22,282
...I'm waiting.

428
00:56:50,105 --> 00:56:52,290
Where have you been all day, Zane?

429
00:56:53,039 --> 00:56:55,332
Out. I had to take care of some stuff.

430
00:56:58,310 --> 00:57:00,562
Yeah well those guys
came by looking for you,

431
00:57:00,600 --> 00:57:03,032
asking about the money you owe them,
what's that all about?

432
00:57:03,057 --> 00:57:05,385
Hey, you know what, that's none
of your business, okay?

433
00:57:05,537 --> 00:57:06,828
Yeah, hell it ain't.

434
00:57:06,959 --> 00:57:08,699
Either way, I paid them back today.

435
00:57:08,998 --> 00:57:11,137
Oh, yeah? And where did you get
the money to do that?

436
00:57:11,346 --> 00:57:14,256
Hey, what's up with all
the fucking questions, okay? I told you.

437
00:57:15,250 --> 00:57:17,153
We got the money from selling coke, okay?

438
00:57:17,506 --> 00:57:20,325
I'm just saying, there is no way you
could have made that much money...

439
00:57:20,350 --> 00:57:21,754
...in that short amount of time.

440
00:57:22,276 --> 00:57:23,712
Why don't you tell me the truth?

441
00:57:25,061 --> 00:57:26,371
Yeah, you know what?

442
00:57:26,491 --> 00:57:29,429
I think it's about time we both started
telling each other the truth here.

443
00:57:29,633 --> 00:57:30,962
What are you talking about?

444
00:57:31,728 --> 00:57:36,044
I stumbled across something the other day,
does Heavenly Hottie ring a bell?

445
00:57:37,360 --> 00:57:38,668
No, Zane, it doesn't.

446
00:57:39,685 --> 00:57:43,814
I don't know, I don't know where
you come from, Miss Mystery Girl.

447
00:57:44,511 --> 00:57:47,097
All I know is I saw you on
some sort of a porn site.

448
00:57:47,649 --> 00:57:49,621
A porn site? Zane, that's fucking crazy.

449
00:57:49,646 --> 00:57:52,274
Look, I'll even show you!

450
00:58:03,576 --> 00:58:06,467
Look, look, Chloe, I'll be damned
if that ain't you.

451
00:58:13,138 --> 00:58:15,456
No, it's not me Zane, that's my sister.

452
00:58:16,144 --> 00:58:17,479
Your sister?

453
00:58:20,905 --> 00:58:22,727
She has a mole, I don't.

454
00:58:25,019 --> 00:58:26,691
She died a few months ago.

455
00:58:26,716 --> 00:58:27,717
What?!

456
00:58:30,505 --> 00:58:35,589
That's why I left Heavenly Valley in the
first place, I couldn't deal with her death.

457
00:58:35,614 --> 00:58:39,201
Chloe, Chloe, Chloe... you never
told me you had a sister.

458
00:58:39,226 --> 00:58:42,027
Anything you want to tell me
about yourself, Miss Chloe?

459
00:58:45,634 --> 00:58:46,668
Zane.

460
00:58:48,309 --> 00:58:50,559
I gotta... I gotta go.

461
00:58:52,536 --> 00:58:55,525
No, no, Chloe, Chloe, I need you here.

462
00:58:56,898 --> 00:59:01,080
Listen, Chloe. I... I'm in deep shit.

463
00:59:04,619 --> 00:59:09,167
I didn't get the money from selling coke,
I got it from Morris.

464
00:59:10,448 --> 00:59:12,302
And how are you ever gonna pay him back?

465
00:59:12,702 --> 00:59:15,278
Listen, I'll work extra
shifts and I'll...

466
00:59:15,775 --> 00:59:19,633
I'll try and hustle some more candy.
It's gonna work, I have it, okay?

467
00:59:19,658 --> 00:59:23,019
God, Zane! Zane, fuck!

468
00:59:28,819 --> 00:59:30,159
And...

469
00:59:32,610 --> 00:59:35,241
...there was another part of the deal
I need to tell you about.

470
00:59:39,381 --> 00:59:41,344
In exchange for lending me the money...

471
00:59:42,780 --> 00:59:44,002
...I promised him...

472
00:59:44,385 --> 00:59:45,735
You promised him what?

473
00:59:48,937 --> 00:59:51,254
I promised him you'd be willing
to sleep with him.

474
00:59:54,038 --> 00:59:55,492
You shit!

475
00:59:55,852 --> 00:59:57,383
You pimped me out?!

476
00:59:57,933 --> 00:59:59,381
Now, you listen to me, Chloe.

477
00:59:59,406 --> 01:00:02,519
I thought that girl was you on the website
that will slut up for anything.

478
01:00:02,544 --> 01:00:06,050
Now if it wasn't for me, your stupid little
ass would still be hustling the streets still.

479
01:00:06,075 --> 01:00:08,373
Now don't forget who got
you into their place...

480
01:00:08,398 --> 01:00:10,225
and don't forget who got you a job
at the club to begin with.

481
01:00:10,250 --> 01:00:12,794
Then don't tell me that, don't tell me...

482
01:00:12,847 --> 01:00:16,476
You shut your mouth Chloe,
you shut your mouth!

483
01:00:34,865 --> 01:00:37,488
No, Zane!

484
01:00:38,894 --> 01:00:42,184
Zane, get off me! Fuck!

485
01:01:10,232 --> 01:01:12,819
It's OK.

486
01:01:57,728 --> 01:01:59,514
Zane?

487
01:01:59,852 --> 01:02:01,572
Yes?

488
01:02:05,844 --> 01:02:07,888
I can't be Morris'.

489
01:02:10,231 --> 01:02:14,485
I know, I know.

490
01:02:16,947 --> 01:02:21,199
I'm such an ass, I can't believe
I dragged you into this.

491
01:02:26,634 --> 01:02:29,465
But I got a plan to make it all better.

492
01:02:30,623 --> 01:02:32,583
And what's that?

493
01:02:34,653 --> 01:02:38,285
I know the combination to Morris's safe.

494
01:02:48,383 --> 01:02:50,848
How are we going to get to it?

495
01:02:52,547 --> 01:02:56,469
He'll want a vermouth and a cigar
before, it's his favorite routine.

496
01:02:57,689 --> 01:03:01,425
I don't know, why can't we just leave now?

497
01:03:01,450 --> 01:03:03,630
With what money, Chloe? Think of it!

498
01:03:04,147 --> 01:03:05,440
It's easy.

499
01:03:06,730 --> 01:03:09,000
He won't expect anything from you.

500
01:03:09,147 --> 01:03:11,483
Slip something into his glass,
get to the safe.

501
01:03:12,356 --> 01:03:15,349
He must have more
than a 100 grand in that safe.

502
01:03:16,861 --> 01:03:19,354
That's more than enough for us
to start fresh somewhere else.

503
01:03:20,286 --> 01:03:21,734
I don't know.

504
01:03:21,759 --> 01:03:23,424
What am I going to do?

505
01:03:24,088 --> 01:03:25,967
You can sell more coke, anything.

506
01:03:25,992 --> 01:03:31,139
No, I need to get that money back tomorrow
ASAP or my time will be up.

507
01:03:41,348 --> 01:03:43,559
When is our first date?

508
01:03:57,671 --> 01:03:58,988
Hi, Zane.

509
01:04:03,321 --> 01:04:06,764
So, Morris really wants to go
through with it tonight?

510
01:04:13,120 --> 01:04:16,626
Zane, are you sure that you
want to go through with that?

511
01:04:25,178 --> 01:04:28,793
All right, are you ready?

512
01:04:33,233 --> 01:04:35,277
I'm late.

513
01:04:38,818 --> 01:04:40,322
Hey.

514
01:04:42,795 --> 01:04:44,972
I'll be out the back from midnight on.

515
01:04:45,690 --> 01:04:47,869
Call or text if things get ugly, okay?

516
01:05:09,550 --> 01:05:11,509
Oh, Chloe!

517
01:05:12,647 --> 01:05:14,107
Person I was looking to see.

518
01:05:14,695 --> 01:05:15,988
Hi, Morris.

519
01:05:16,664 --> 01:05:18,073
How are you this evening?

520
01:05:19,134 --> 01:05:20,811
I'm well, how about yourself?

521
01:05:20,849 --> 01:05:22,267
I'm great.

522
01:05:23,337 --> 01:05:26,620
Zane did enlighten you about
our little deal, right?

523
01:05:28,405 --> 01:05:29,698
He sure did.

524
01:05:31,641 --> 01:05:36,065
Because I would like to redeem one
of those coupons tonight.

525
01:05:36,874 --> 01:05:40,358
That is as long as you are not too busy?

526
01:05:42,572 --> 01:05:44,166
No, Morris, I'm not.

527
01:05:44,846 --> 01:05:46,263
That's great.

528
01:05:47,455 --> 01:05:50,875
Why don't you join me in my office?

529
01:05:55,420 --> 01:05:58,464
Sure, why don't I fix you
a drink at the bar first?

530
01:05:59,175 --> 01:06:00,702
It's a marvelous idea.

531
01:06:01,288 --> 01:06:03,932
How about a vermouth straight up?

532
01:06:07,822 --> 01:06:08,536
Sure.

533
01:06:09,792 --> 01:06:10,925
See you in a few.

534
01:06:59,373 --> 01:07:00,655
Hey, Chloe.

535
01:07:00,680 --> 01:07:01,950
Hi, Morris.

536
01:07:01,975 --> 01:07:03,208
How are you doing?

537
01:07:04,780 --> 01:07:06,305
Doing well.

538
01:07:09,822 --> 01:07:12,158
We missed you last weekend at the club.

539
01:07:13,391 --> 01:07:14,509
I know.

540
01:07:15,514 --> 01:07:18,781
Yeah, the regulars,
they get a little testy...

541
01:07:19,072 --> 01:07:21,783
...when they don't get their usual
pick of the litter.

542
01:07:22,178 --> 01:07:23,929
I bet.

543
01:07:26,389 --> 01:07:28,475
You know, honey,

544
01:07:29,390 --> 01:07:31,767
if you work your cards right,

545
01:07:32,011 --> 01:07:35,890
I'm just gonna have to make you
a dancer at the new club.

546
01:07:36,945 --> 01:07:41,074
And you'll be making three times
the money you are making right now.

547
01:07:43,101 --> 01:07:48,524
Because I do know talent.

548
01:07:51,315 --> 01:07:53,902
Well, thank you, Morris. I'm flattered.

549
01:07:54,872 --> 01:07:57,552
Why don't I get you your drink
I made for you.

550
01:08:00,303 --> 01:08:03,753
Did you spill honey? That's okay,
I didn't need that drink anyway.

551
01:08:03,961 --> 01:08:05,921
Because, you know,

552
01:08:07,967 --> 01:08:12,676
I knew that you had the talent...

553
01:08:13,364 --> 01:08:17,595
...that every man should experience.

554
01:08:17,845 --> 01:08:20,565
Why don't we both get ourselves a drink?

555
01:08:20,590 --> 01:08:23,250
Because I don't want a drink.
I don't need a drink.

556
01:08:23,350 --> 01:08:28,127
I am ready to experience...

557
01:08:29,084 --> 01:08:34,758
...all the good things that I'm sure
that you are capable of doing.

558
01:08:36,803 --> 01:08:43,232
So, I think we should just go on upstairs
and get to know each other a little bit.

559
01:08:45,493 --> 01:08:47,414
Morris, I insist.

560
01:08:47,614 --> 01:08:49,147
Well, Chloe,

561
01:08:50,387 --> 01:08:56,184
I really am done with the small talk
and fucking around...

562
01:08:56,488 --> 01:09:03,100
...because it's time to go fuck.

563
01:12:02,502 --> 01:12:06,691
No, no, no, Chloe.

564
01:12:06,914 --> 01:12:09,204
Chloe? Babe?

565
01:12:09,229 --> 01:12:12,432
Wake up. Babe, wake up!

566
01:12:12,693 --> 01:12:15,948
Wake up! Wake up, Chloe!

567
01:12:16,107 --> 01:12:19,068
Come on baby, wake up Chloe!

568
01:12:19,664 --> 01:12:20,873
Chloe, wake up!

569
01:12:21,716 --> 01:12:25,509
Wake up, Chloe! Hey, babe. Wake up!

570
01:12:26,837 --> 01:12:28,694
Wake up, baby.

571
01:12:30,238 --> 01:12:33,870
Wake up, Chloe, wake up.

572
01:13:04,481 --> 01:13:05,574
Zane!

573
01:13:09,454 --> 01:13:10,655
What are you gonna do, Zane?

574
01:13:10,663 --> 01:13:12,374
Liliy! Not now!

575
01:13:15,297 --> 01:13:19,551
Where are the matches, huh?
Where the fuck are my matches?

576
01:13:19,892 --> 01:13:23,484
Zane, the doctors said you ain't
supposed to smoke in the house, remember?

577
01:13:23,509 --> 01:13:25,065
I don't have time for this right now.

578
01:13:25,090 --> 01:13:26,842
Well, then answer me, damn it.

579
01:13:27,615 --> 01:13:28,492
Don't tell me what to do.

580
01:13:30,956 --> 01:13:32,022
Why don't you listen to me?

581
01:13:35,526 --> 01:13:37,836
Don't you get feisty with me here, okay?

582
01:13:37,861 --> 01:13:40,280
I told you I don't have time
for this right now.

583
01:13:41,547 --> 01:13:42,941
I gotta get to work.

584
01:13:43,630 --> 01:13:46,079
Working a double shift,
we'll talk about it later.

585
01:13:48,925 --> 01:13:51,120
Zane?
What?

586
01:13:54,586 --> 01:13:57,548
Do you still love me?

587
01:17:09,975 --> 01:17:11,810
So, what's your big problem?

588
01:17:12,064 --> 01:17:14,966
Morris, I need to talk to you about Chloe.

589
01:17:15,105 --> 01:17:16,189
What about her?

590
01:17:16,686 --> 01:17:20,357
She is not doing well,
she is in a real bad shape.

591
01:17:21,352 --> 01:17:22,895
I want to strike a deal, Morris.

592
01:17:23,915 --> 01:17:26,125
What?
I need to renegotiate.

593
01:17:26,432 --> 01:17:31,758
Zane, you know in my book
that a deal is a deal.

594
01:17:31,830 --> 01:17:34,291
And when it's done, it's done.

595
01:17:34,835 --> 01:17:37,588
I've made a big mistake.

596
01:17:37,669 --> 01:17:39,337
It wasn't Chloe on the website.

597
01:17:39,692 --> 01:17:43,155
What are you talking about
it wasn't Chloe for God's sake.

598
01:17:43,180 --> 01:17:45,402
I mean it just wasn't, okay?

599
01:17:46,514 --> 01:17:49,623
It was her sister.
She died a few months ago.

600
01:17:50,272 --> 01:17:53,675
And I need Chloe to be out of this.

601
01:17:56,637 --> 01:17:58,384
That's not gonna happen, Zane.

602
01:18:01,124 --> 01:18:04,978
Listen, Morris, I already
work double shifts for you,

603
01:18:05,498 --> 01:18:08,681
you can keep that out of my wages,
keep my tips, I'll do anything Morris,

604
01:18:08,706 --> 01:18:11,000
but I need Chloe out of our deal.

605
01:18:12,210 --> 01:18:14,832
I don't know if we can do that, Zane.

606
01:18:18,289 --> 01:18:21,309
Morris, please.

607
01:18:32,725 --> 01:18:35,794
I brought the only thing
that has value in my life.

608
01:18:47,872 --> 01:18:53,654
I was married once.
Someone I loved very much.

609
01:18:59,290 --> 01:19:02,183
Zane, I don't even think it would cover
half of what you owe me though.

610
01:19:03,144 --> 01:19:05,639
I know, but like I said
I'll work off the rest.

611
01:19:10,655 --> 01:19:14,520
Listen, Morris, everyone
deserves a second chance.

612
01:19:22,841 --> 01:19:25,260
All right, Zane.

613
01:19:32,756 --> 01:19:35,301
Oh, hell.

614
01:19:38,953 --> 01:19:41,290
I suppose...

615
01:19:46,163 --> 01:19:47,990
I suppose so.

616
01:19:53,908 --> 01:19:55,643
Zane...

617
01:19:57,582 --> 01:19:59,082
Goddamn it.

618
01:20:00,192 --> 01:20:02,896
If I let you off the hook on this,

619
01:20:05,346 --> 01:20:07,658
you have to understand,

620
01:20:09,826 --> 01:20:11,482
this is a one time deal.

621
01:20:11,968 --> 01:20:14,102
Do you understand that?
Yes, Morris, I understand that.

622
01:20:14,142 --> 01:20:16,043
I promise I'll never
get in this deep again.

623
01:20:16,494 --> 01:20:17,818
All right.

624
01:20:21,448 --> 01:20:24,054
You work off what you owe me.

625
01:20:27,027 --> 01:20:29,355
And when that is done,

626
01:20:31,511 --> 01:20:34,473
Chloe is free and clear.

627
01:20:50,479 --> 01:20:52,230
Goddamn it.

628
01:20:53,706 --> 01:20:56,987
You remind me so much of him.

629
01:20:59,998 --> 01:21:03,228
And I can't believe what I'm about to do.

630
01:21:09,779 --> 01:21:14,867
You know, Zane, I had a son once.

631
01:21:21,458 --> 01:21:23,913
And he looked so much like you.

632
01:21:27,227 --> 01:21:29,007
So much.

633
01:21:36,628 --> 01:21:39,688
He was killed in a car accident.

634
01:21:42,626 --> 01:21:45,444
I want you to take this.

635
01:21:47,081 --> 01:21:49,360
And I want you to take Chloe...

636
01:21:50,348 --> 01:21:55,061
...and I want you guys to go
and start a new life, away from here.

637
01:22:00,780 --> 01:22:02,941
He loved that car.

638
01:22:05,453 --> 01:22:08,071
That car was supposed to be...

639
01:22:12,739 --> 01:22:15,492
...his 21st birthday present.

640
01:22:18,546 --> 01:22:20,721
He never got it, Zane.

641
01:22:25,919 --> 01:22:27,879
So, trust me on this one.

642
01:22:32,123 --> 01:22:34,417
This is my second chance.

643
01:22:37,343 --> 01:22:40,333
So, don't fuck it up for me, all right?

644
01:22:43,051 --> 01:22:45,345
Now get out of here.

645
01:22:52,173 --> 01:22:55,218
You take care, son.
