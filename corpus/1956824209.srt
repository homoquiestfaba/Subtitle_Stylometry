I JUST DO THIS FOR AN HOUR.

    "THAT WAS THE WORST SHOW
         I'VE EVER SEEN!

10
00:01:42,902 --> 00:01:46,672
        I PAID OVER $40.

11
00:01:46,739 --> 00:01:50,375
     AFTER THE SERVICE FEE,
          IT WAS $90."

13
00:01:53,913 --> 00:01:56,682
         CONVENIENT WAY

14
00:01:56,749 --> 00:01:59,685
          ( falsetto )
      HE'S LIKE PEARL JAM.

15
00:02:01,321 --> 00:02:04,656
     HE'S TAKING ON THE MAN.

16
00:02:04,724 --> 00:02:07,559
    HEY, WAIT A MINUTE.
     HE LOOKS LIKE THE MAN.

17
00:02:07,627 --> 00:02:11,163
    HE'S KIND OF PUDGY.
      MAYBE HE ATE THE MAN.

18
00:02:11,231 --> 00:02:15,134
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT MAN
      WE'RE TALKING ABOUT.

19
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:19,838
    I THOUGHT HE'D BE PALER.

20
00:02:19,906 --> 00:02:22,274
AT LEAST AS PALE AS THAT CD

21
00:02:22,342 --> 00:02:24,743
         WHERE HE LOOKS
        LIKE A PEDOPHILE.

22
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:27,746
          ( cheering )

23
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:33,452
          ( falsetto )
        WELL, HE WAS GOOD
          IN "CAPOTE."

24
00:02:39,626 --> 00:02:42,027
     HOW LARGE IS HIS HEAD?

25
00:02:42,095 --> 00:02:45,464
IS HE STORING ANOTHER HEAD
        INSIDE OF THERE?

26
00:02:45,532 --> 00:02:48,367
      HE COULD BE A MASCOT.

27
00:02:49,702 --> 00:02:52,471
      HE COULD BE A MASCOT
        FOR THE MORMONS.

28
00:02:54,641 --> 00:02:57,075
        I'M ALREADY SICK
         OF THIS VOICE.

29
00:02:57,143 --> 00:03:01,180
      WHEN'S HE GONNA START
          CRACKING IT?

30
00:03:01,247 --> 00:03:02,981
        ( normal )
        IT IS GREAT TO BE
         HERE IN AUSTIN.

31
00:03:03,049 --> 00:03:04,583
    THANK YOU FOR COMING OUT.

32
00:03:04,651 --> 00:03:07,252
          ( cheering )

33
00:03:09,522 --> 00:03:12,891
        GREAT TO BE HERE.

34
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:16,261
I'VE HAD SO MUCH FUN HERE.

35
00:03:16,329 --> 00:03:18,030
             I HAVE.
         I WENT BOWLING.

36
00:03:18,097 --> 00:03:20,132
      I DON'T MEAN TO BRAG.

37
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,868
REALLY, THERE ARE TWO TYPES
OF PEOPLE THAT GO BOWLING.

38
00:03:22,936 --> 00:03:25,470
  THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT REALLY
      REALLY LOVE BOWLING,

39
00:03:25,538 --> 00:03:27,339
    AND THEN THERE ARE PEOPLE
         THAT ARE LIKE,

40
00:03:27,407 --> 00:03:29,775
"WOULDN'T IT BE HYSTERICAL
      IF WE WENT BOWLING?"

41
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:33,745
      'CAUSE FOR MOST OF US

42
00:03:33,813 --> 00:03:35,647
        BOWLING IS
    THE ACTIVITY YOU DO

43
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:38,417
        AFTER YOU'VE DONE
        EVERYTHING ELSE.

44
00:03:38,484 --> 00:03:41,019
        IT'S LIKE, "WELL,
    WE COULD GO BOWLING

45
00:03:41,087 --> 00:03:43,322
        OR WE COULD
      JUST HANG OURSELVES.

46
00:03:44,857 --> 00:03:47,426
    WHY DON'T WE GO BOWLING?"

47
00:03:47,493 --> 00:03:50,996
NO ONE IS EVER JEALOUS WHEN
THEY HEAR YOU WENT BOWLING.

48
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:54,032
     "OH, YOU WENT BOWLING?
    GLAD I COULDN'T MAKE IT."

49
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:56,201
        BOWLING'S GREAT.

50
00:03:56,269 --> 00:03:59,104
     YOU GOT TO LOVE A SPORT
 YOU CAN EAT WHILE YOU PLAY IT.

51
00:04:00,607 --> 00:04:03,008
    NEVER SEE THAT IN TENNIS.
     "HEY, BEFORE YOU SERVE,

52
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:04,977
        LET ME DIG
    INTO THESE NACHOS."

53
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:08,080
     IT'S A DIFFERENT SPORT.

54
00:04:08,147 --> 00:04:11,183
    THERE'S AN ASHTRAY BUILT
INTO THE BOWLING EQUIPMENT.

55
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:14,620
    POKER DOESN'T EVEN
        HAVE THAT.

56
00:04:14,687 --> 00:04:17,689
AND THAT HAND-DRYER THING?

57
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:20,025
    IF YOU'RE SWEATING
      WHILE YOU'RE BOWLING,

58
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:21,827
      YOU'RE OUT OF SHAPE.

59
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:30,469
AND IF YOU'RE OUT OF SHAPE
    AND YOU'RE BOWLING,

60
00:04:30,536 --> 00:04:32,537
         YOU'RE PROBABLY
     A PROFESSIONAL BOWLER.

61
00:04:34,474 --> 00:04:37,209
     THERE'S NOTHING REALLY
     HEALTHY ABOUT BOWLING.

62
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:40,045
          IT HAS TO BE
THE GERMAPHOBE'S NIGHTMARE.

63
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:43,582
 "HERE, PUT ON THESE MOIST SHOES
    10,000 PEOPLE WORE

64
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:47,486
     AND STICK YOUR FINGERS
     IN THESE DIRTY HOLES.

65
00:04:47,553 --> 00:04:49,521
     NOW YOU HAVE THE FLU."

66
00:04:50,823 --> 00:04:53,358
            HOW DIRTY
        ARE THOSE HOLES?

67
00:04:53,426 --> 00:04:56,595
    IT'S NOT LIKE THOSE
         BALLS WEAR OUT.

68
00:04:56,663 --> 00:04:59,097
      THEY PROBABLY HAVEN'T
MANUFACTURED A BOWLING BALL

69
00:04:59,165 --> 00:05:01,500
         IN 1,000 YEARS.

70
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:04,770
  SOMEONE'S OUT THERE IS USING
  FRED FLINTSTONE'S RIGHT NOW.

71
00:05:04,837 --> 00:05:08,006
          ( falsetto )
      THAT IS PREPOSTEROUS.

72
00:05:08,074 --> 00:05:09,708
        ( normal )
I DON'T OWN A BOWLING BALL

73
00:05:09,776 --> 00:05:12,911
    'CAUSE I'M NOT A WEIRDO.

74
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:16,348
"YEAH, I WANT TO VOLUNTEER
  TO CARRY AROUND A 50-LB BALL.

75
00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:19,551
         CAN YOU PUT IT
      IN A BIG UGLY PURSE?

76
00:05:19,619 --> 00:05:22,421
        THAT'S HOW I WANT
      TO MEET THE LADIES."

77
00:05:22,488 --> 00:05:25,590
  "OH, COULDN'T HELP BUT NOTICE
    YOU STARING AT MY PURSE.

78
00:05:25,658 --> 00:05:27,993
        IT'S FILLED
      WITH A BIG BLUE BALL.

79
00:05:28,061 --> 00:05:30,929
      MIND IF I FOLLOW YOU
     AROUND THE PARKING LOT?

80
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:33,465
     I'LL JUST BE HUMMING."
        ( humming )

81
00:05:34,701 --> 00:05:37,269
      â™ª BALL IN THE BAG.

82
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:39,771
        THAT'S THE WORST
        SONG EVER.

83
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:42,507
    I ALWAYS HAVE TO PICK OUT
        MY BOWLING BALL.

84
00:05:42,575 --> 00:05:43,942
        I CAN NEVER FIND
         THE RIGHT ONE.

85
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:46,078
            I'M LIKE,
     "THIS ONE IS TOO HEAVY.

86
00:05:46,145 --> 00:05:49,181
        THIS ONE IS GOOD,
         BUT IT'S PINK.

87
00:05:49,248 --> 00:05:51,817
AND MY FINGERS DON'T FIT."

88
00:05:51,884 --> 00:05:54,753
    HOW DO THEY DECIDE
     ON THOSE FINGER SIZES?

89
00:05:54,821 --> 00:05:56,655
         THEY'RE EITHER
    FOR A FIVE-YEAR-OLD GIRL

90
00:05:56,723 --> 00:05:59,257
     OR THE INCREDIBLE HULK.

91
00:05:59,325 --> 00:06:02,127
        HOW BIG ARE SOME
        PEOPLE'S FINGERS?

92
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:03,829
        SOME GUY WEARING
        A CATCHER'S MITT?

93
00:06:03,896 --> 00:06:06,131
        "YEAH, IT'S GOOD.

94
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:08,266
I CAN STILL CATCH THE GAME.
     DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT."

95
00:06:09,936 --> 00:06:12,604
      THOSE BOWLING SHOES,
        NO UPDATE THERE.

96
00:06:12,672 --> 00:06:14,473
            "YOU NEED
        OUR SPECIAL SHOES

97
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:16,775
    BEFORE YOU CAN ROLL
        OUR MAGIC BALL."

98
00:06:18,544 --> 00:06:20,512
        SOME PEOPLE HAVE
     THEIR OWN BOWLING BALL

99
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:22,881
AND THEIR OWN BOWLING SHOES
         AND NO FRIENDS.

100
00:06:24,484 --> 00:06:27,018
          ( falsetto )
          THAT'S MEAN.

101
00:06:27,086 --> 00:06:29,054
         I CAN SAY THAT
     'CAUSE I LIKE BOWLING.

102
00:06:29,122 --> 00:06:30,956
     I WATCH BOWLING ON TV,

103
00:06:31,023 --> 00:06:32,924
          'CAUSE I USE
         MY TIME WISELY.

104
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:36,528
     I SAW THIS COLLEGE-TEAM
          CHAMPIONSHIP.

105
00:06:36,596 --> 00:06:38,797
          EACH TEAM HAD
        THEIR OWN COACH.

106
00:06:38,865 --> 00:06:40,899
            WHAT KIND
    OF STRATEGY ADVICE

107
00:06:40,967 --> 00:06:43,468
    IS A BOWLING COACH
             GIVING?

108
00:06:43,536 --> 00:06:45,637
         "YOU KNOW WHAT?
        THIS TIME, TIMMY,

109
00:06:45,705 --> 00:06:47,506
    I WANT YOU TO KNOCK DOWN
         ALL THE PINS."

110
00:06:49,809 --> 00:06:53,078
         "ARE YOU SURE?"
        "TRUST ME.

111
00:06:53,146 --> 00:06:54,880
        JUST DO IT, SON!"

112
00:06:54,947 --> 00:06:57,182
          THAT'S WEIRD.

113
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:58,984
      BOWLING SEEMS SILLY,

114
00:06:59,051 --> 00:07:01,686
    YET WE ALL TAKE IT
     VERY SERIOUSLY, RIGHT?

115
00:07:01,754 --> 00:07:03,989
     TILL WE GET THAT FIRST
     GUTTER BALL WE'RE LIKE,

116
00:07:04,056 --> 00:07:06,057
        "LET ME SHOW YOU
        HOW IT'S DONE."

117
00:07:06,125 --> 00:07:09,060
        ( laughs )
    "THIS IS A STUPID SPORT."

118
00:07:11,464 --> 00:07:13,098
    THERE'S FEW MOMENTS
             IN LIFE

119
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:15,100
         AS HUMILIATING
      AS THAT GUTTER BALL.

120
00:07:15,168 --> 00:07:17,102
        THE WORST PART IS
      THEN YOU HAVE TO MAKE

121
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:19,204
         THAT TURN BACK
        TO YOUR FRIENDS.

122
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:26,812
      "THAT BALL'S BROKEN.

123
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:30,248
    IT'S TILTED DOWN THERE."

124
00:07:30,316 --> 00:07:32,417
         YOU NEVER WANT
     TO BE THE WORST BOWLER
          OF THE GROUP

125
00:07:32,485 --> 00:07:34,686
'CAUSE EVERYONE TREATS YOU
      LIKE YOU HAVE CANCER.

126
00:07:34,754 --> 00:07:36,721
         "YOU CAN DO IT.

127
00:07:38,758 --> 00:07:41,393
     WE'RE PRAYING FOR YOU."

128
00:07:42,929 --> 00:07:45,330
    THE ADVICE STARTS:
      "USE A HEAVIER BALL.

129
00:07:45,398 --> 00:07:47,766
     KEEP YOUR ARM STRAIGHT.
  YOU SHOULD GET A VASECTOMY."

130
00:07:49,936 --> 00:07:51,937
       <i>IF YOU'RE REALLY BAD</i>
       <i>AT BOWLING LIKE ME, </i>

131
00:07:52,004 --> 00:07:54,372
     THEY'LL ASK IF YOU WANT
         THE BUMPERS UP.

132
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:57,275
     IT'S NOT LIKE BOWLING'S
      THAT COMPLEX ANYWAY.

133
00:07:57,343 --> 00:07:59,277
     "YOU WANT THE BUMPERS?
WE CAN GET RID OF THE PINS.

134
00:07:59,345 --> 00:08:01,580
    WHY DON'T YOU TAKE
    THIS COLORING BOOK
     AND SIT IN THE CORNER?"

135
00:08:04,283 --> 00:08:07,853
    BUT I LIKE BOWLING.
 IT'S PERFECT FOR THE LAZY MAN.

136
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:10,155
         NO OTHER SPORT
          HAS A MACHINE

137
00:08:10,223 --> 00:08:12,491
    THAT ROLLS THE BALL
        BACK TO YOU

138
00:08:12,558 --> 00:08:15,260
          AT ARM LEVEL.

139
00:08:17,263 --> 00:08:20,098
        "ALL RIGHT,
    I'LL KEEP PLAYING.

140
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:22,634
 IS THERE ANY WAY I CAN DO THIS
    IN A CHAIR OR SOMETHING?"

141
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:33,645
          I JUST PREFER
          THE EASY WAY
         IN LIFE.  I DO.

142
00:08:33,713 --> 00:08:35,680
    I SEE AN ESCALATOR,
         I GET EXCITED.

143
00:08:35,748 --> 00:08:38,316
    I'M LIKE, "SWEET!
    ALL I'VE GOT TO DO
      IS KEEP MY BALANCE."

144
00:08:40,486 --> 00:08:42,420
      PEOPLE LOOK SO BORED
         ON ESCALATORS.

145
00:08:42,488 --> 00:08:44,489
     THEY'RE ALWAYS LIKE...
            ( sighs )

146
00:08:44,557 --> 00:08:47,659
      THEY SHOULD BE LIKE,
      "I'M GOING UP STAIRS
    WITHOUT MOVING MY LEGS!"

147
00:08:49,862 --> 00:08:52,163
        I LIKE TO PRETEND
        I'M IN CHARGE OF
         THE ESCALATOR.

148
00:08:52,231 --> 00:08:54,633
  TURN TO THE PEOPLE BEHIND ME,
      "YOU GUYS FOLLOW ME.

149
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:56,701
          STAND THERE,
        KEEP THAT PACE."

150
00:08:58,771 --> 00:09:01,873
EVER BEEN ON AN ESCALATOR
AND SOMEONE STARTS WALKING
         UP BEHIND YOU?

151
00:09:01,941 --> 00:09:04,242
            I'M LIKE,
      "SETTLE DOWN, WEIRDO.

152
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:07,646
         THIS IS ONE OF
    THE GOOD PARTS OF LIFE."

153
00:09:07,713 --> 00:09:09,814
     HOW ABOUT THOSE PEOPLE
      THAT TAKE THE STAIRS

154
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:12,083
          RIGHT NEXT TO
         THE ESCALATOR?

155
00:09:12,151 --> 00:09:14,019
      "WHAT ARE YOU DRUNK?

156
00:09:14,086 --> 00:09:16,454
    THIS THING IS FREE.

157
00:09:16,522 --> 00:09:18,490
         YOU DON'T NEED
        A TICKET."

158
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:20,325
      THEY'RE ALWAYS LIKE,
     "I'M TAKING THE STAIRS

159
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:22,060
    'CAUSE I'M WATCHING
        MY CHOLESTEROL."

160
00:09:22,128 --> 00:09:24,229
THEN HALFWAY UP THEY ALWAYS
  HAVE THAT LOOK IN THEIR EYES:

161
00:09:24,297 --> 00:09:26,965
        "I'VE MADE
      AN ENORMOUS MISTAKE.

162
00:09:27,033 --> 00:09:30,335
     THESE STAIRS ARE HARD."

163
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:33,805
 THE ESCALATOR DEFINITELY MAKES
    YOU LOOK DOWN ON STAIRS.

164
00:09:33,873 --> 00:09:36,741
    "YOU'RE NOTHING MORE THAN
    AN ORGANIZED HILL."

165
00:09:38,311 --> 00:09:40,245
      THE ONLY THING WORSE
     THAN WALKING UP STAIRS

166
00:09:40,313 --> 00:09:43,081
IS WALKING UP AN ESCALATOR
    THAT'S NOT WORKING.

167
00:09:43,149 --> 00:09:46,351
    "WHAT'S THE POINT?
        IT'S LIKE HAVING
        A DEAD BUTLER."

168
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:48,420
            COME ON.

169
00:09:48,487 --> 00:09:50,388
          ( falsetto )
    MY BUTLER DIED LAST WEEK.

170
00:09:52,391 --> 00:09:54,492
     WE ALL LOOK SO CONFUSED
        WHEN WE ENCOUNTER

171
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,461
          THE ESCALATOR
    THAT'S NOT WORKING.

172
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:01,666
    "HOW AM I SUPPOSED
        TO GET UP THERE?

173
00:10:03,536 --> 00:10:05,604
          I'M TRAPPED!

174
00:10:05,671 --> 00:10:06,938
          HELP!  HELP!"

175
00:10:09,041 --> 00:10:11,710
      I DON'T LIKE IT WHEN
      THEY SEPARATE THE UP
     AND THE DOWN ESCALATOR.

176
00:10:11,777 --> 00:10:13,311
     THEY DO THAT IN MALLS.
          YOU'RE LIKE,

177
00:10:13,379 --> 00:10:15,447
"HERE'S THE DOWN ESCALATOR,
        WHERE'S THE UP?"

178
00:10:15,514 --> 00:10:18,850
    "OH, THAT'S CONVENIENTLY
      LOCATED A MILE AWAY.

179
00:10:18,918 --> 00:10:22,320
     DID YOU BRING A CANOE?
    'CAUSE THERE'S A RIVER."

180
00:10:22,388 --> 00:10:25,991
    IT ALSO AMAZING AFTER ALL
 OUR TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCEMENTS

181
00:10:26,058 --> 00:10:28,093
    WE STILL CAN'T GET
     THE ESCALATOR HANDRAIL

182
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:31,162
      TO GO THE SAME SPEED
        AS THE ESCALATOR.

183
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:34,132
"LOOKS LIKE MY HAND'S GONNA
     GET UP THERE BEFORE ME.

184
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,468
     SEE YOU UP THERE, HAND.

185
00:10:36,535 --> 00:10:38,503
      I'D WAVE BUT I DON'T
          HAVE A HAND."

186
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,674
      THE MOVING SIDEWALK?

187
00:10:42,742 --> 00:10:44,809
     THAT'S LIKE THE COUSIN
        OF THE ESCALATOR.

188
00:10:44,877 --> 00:10:46,444
        THOSE ARE SWEET.

189
00:10:46,512 --> 00:10:48,647
THERE IS ALWAYS THAT MOMENT
      WHEN I'M GETTING OFF

190
00:10:48,714 --> 00:10:51,516
        A MOVING SIDEWALK
     WHERE I'M LIKE, "HOW DO
          I WALK AGAIN?

191
00:10:51,584 --> 00:10:54,619
        I HAVEN'T DONE IT
          IN LIKE 10'.

192
00:10:54,687 --> 00:10:58,723
    LEARNING TO WALK AGAIN."

193
00:10:58,791 --> 00:11:01,493
     YOU EVER FIND YOURSELF
  WALKING ON A MOVING SIDEWALK?

194
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:03,595
    YOU START PASSING PEOPLE.

195
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:06,831
          FOR A SECOND,
     DON'T YOU FEEL BIONIC?
    YOU'RE LIKE, DUN-DUN-DUN.

196
00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:09,134
    "SEE YOU SLOWPOKES
    AT THE CINNABON."
          DUN-DUN-DUN.

197
00:11:10,569 --> 00:11:12,370
        "HE'S LIKE
     A PROFESSIONAL WALKER.

198
00:11:12,438 --> 00:11:15,540
    HE'S LIKE 'WALKER,
     TEXAS RANGER' WALKER."

199
00:11:15,608 --> 00:11:17,609
          ( cheering )

200
00:11:22,748 --> 00:11:25,483
        HAVE YOU BEEN ON
    THE MOVING SIDEWALK THAT
      HAS THE ANNOUNCEMENT?

201
00:11:25,551 --> 00:11:27,619
      "SIDEWALK IS ENDING."

202
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:30,388
        ARE WE THAT DUMB?

203
00:11:30,456 --> 00:11:32,257
        WERE THERE PEOPLE
      STANDING AT THE END,

204
00:11:32,324 --> 00:11:34,793
         "THIS IS GOING
         REAL SLOW NOW.

205
00:11:36,162 --> 00:11:37,662
         OH, IT STOPPED?

206
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:40,465
      WHY DIDN'T THEY MAKE
        AN ANNOUNCEMENT?

207
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:44,035
 I DON'T HAVE TIME TO LOOK DOWN.
I'M BUSY DAYDREAMING HERE."

208
00:11:44,103 --> 00:11:46,438
          ( falsetto )
    THAT'S JUST WEIRD.

209
00:11:48,107 --> 00:11:50,675
     I WENT CAMPING RECENTLY
    FOR THIS NEXT JOKE.

210
00:11:53,412 --> 00:11:55,180
        I MARRIED A WOMAN
        WHO LOVES TO CAMP

211
00:11:55,247 --> 00:11:57,982
        AND I AM WHAT YOU
      WOULD CALL INDOORSY.

212
00:11:59,652 --> 00:12:01,720
I'M SURPRISED WE CAN STILL
    GET PEOPLE TO CAMP.

213
00:12:01,787 --> 00:12:03,955
    "HEY, WANT TO BURN
    A COUPLE OF VACATION DAYS

214
00:12:04,023 --> 00:12:05,757
        SLEEPING ON
      THE GROUND OUTSIDE?"

215
00:12:05,825 --> 00:12:07,625
             UH, NO.

216
00:12:07,693 --> 00:12:10,962
"WHAT IF I TOLD YOU YOU GET
    TO CRAP STANDING UP
         IN THE WOODS?"

217
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:13,598
        I STILL WOULDN'T
        WANT TO GO.

218
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:16,501
    "YOU'LL WAKE UP FREEZING
    COVERED IN A RASH."

219
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:18,670
    ALL RIGHT, I'LL GO.

220
00:12:20,606 --> 00:12:23,808
    MY WIFE ALWAYS BRINGS UP,
     "CAMPING IS A TRADITION
         IN MY FAMILY."

221
00:12:23,876 --> 00:12:25,944
     HEY, IT WAS A TRADITION
      IN EVERYONE'S FAMILY

222
00:12:26,011 --> 00:12:29,047
         TILL WE CAME UP
         WITH THE HOUSE.

223
00:12:29,115 --> 00:12:31,116
        MY PARENTS NEVER
        TOOK ME CAMPING.

224
00:12:31,183 --> 00:12:33,585
          YOU KNOW WHY?
      'CAUSE THEY LOVED ME.

225
00:12:33,652 --> 00:12:36,254
         "IT'LL GET YOU
    CLOSER TO NATURE."

226
00:12:36,322 --> 00:12:38,790
         I WANT TO KEEP
 THE RELATIONSHIP PROFESSIONAL.

227
00:12:38,858 --> 00:12:41,392
    IF IT'S SO GREAT OUTSIDE

228
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:43,962
      WHY ARE ALL THE BUGS
TRYING TO GET IN MY HOUSE?

229
00:12:45,331 --> 00:12:47,665
        SOME PLACES
    YOU HAVE TO PAY TO CAMP.

230
00:12:47,733 --> 00:12:50,034
         YOU HAVE TO PAY
        TO SLEEP OUTSIDE.

231
00:12:50,102 --> 00:12:52,604
THAT'S GOT TO BE INSULTING
     TO THE HOMELESS PEOPLE.

232
00:12:52,671 --> 00:12:54,372
            "HOW MUCH
         THIS COST YOU?"

233
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,808
    "I LIVE OUT HERE!"

234
00:12:56,876 --> 00:12:59,577
      "THAT MUST BE REALLY
        EXPENSIVE."

235
00:12:59,645 --> 00:13:02,747
  OCCASIONALLY AT THE CAMPSITE
    YOU'LL SEE THE WINNEBAGO.

236
00:13:02,815 --> 00:13:04,849
    THAT'S KIND OF CHEATING,
            ISN'T IT?

237
00:13:04,917 --> 00:13:06,851
"OH, THAT'S WHAT I FORGOT.
        MY HOUSE."

238
00:13:10,089 --> 00:13:12,791
 THERE'S ALWAYS THAT ONE COUPLE
        AT EVERY CAMPSITE

239
00:13:12,858 --> 00:13:15,794
    THAT'S BEEN CAMPING
        FOR WAY TOO LONG.

240
00:13:15,861 --> 00:13:18,830
  THEY HAVE THE FOLDING CHAIRS,
  THE CHRISTMAS LIGHTS IN JULY.

241
00:13:18,898 --> 00:13:20,598
    "WE'D LOVE TO HAVE
        YOU FOR DINNER."

242
00:13:20,666 --> 00:13:23,434
    I'M SURE YOU WOULD.

243
00:13:23,502 --> 00:13:26,204
        NOW HOW DO I GET
      A PADLOCK ON MY TENT

244
00:13:26,272 --> 00:13:29,007
    SO WE'RE NOT EATEN
      BY MA AND PA DAHMER?

245
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:33,344
          ( falsetto )
          HAPPY CAMPER.

246
00:13:33,412 --> 00:13:35,547
     HAS ANYONE EVER REALLY
      BEEN A HAPPY CAMPER?

247
00:13:35,614 --> 00:13:38,483
'CAUSE WHENEVER WE USE THAT
TERM WE'RE BEING SARCASTIC.

248
00:13:38,551 --> 00:13:40,718
"HE IS NOT A HAPPY CAMPER."

249
00:13:42,188 --> 00:13:44,756
    WHY DON'T WE JUST
    CALL HIM A CAMPER?

250
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:46,958
         HE'S MISERABLE.
 YOU KNOW WHO'S A HAPPY CAMPER?

251
00:13:47,026 --> 00:13:49,060
         THE GUY LEAVING
          THE CAMPSITE.

252
00:13:49,128 --> 00:13:52,163
    HE'S THE HAPPIEST CAMPER.
    HE GETS TO TAKE A SHOWER.

253
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:55,567
          ( falsetto )
    HE RUINED CAMPING FOR ME.

254
00:13:57,703 --> 00:14:00,438
        TO BE FAIR,
         IT IS BEAUTIFUL
         DURING THE DAY.

255
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:03,141
          BUT AT NIGHT
    YOU'RE ALWAYS LIKE,
      "WE'RE ALL GONNA DIE!

256
00:14:03,209 --> 00:14:07,045
THERE'S MONSTERS OUT THERE.
    I SEE THEIR EYES."

257
00:14:07,112 --> 00:14:09,247
    I PROBABLY WOULDN'T
          BE SO SCARED

258
00:14:09,315 --> 00:14:11,816
        IF I WASN'T
    SLEEPING IN A <i>BAG.</i>

259
00:14:11,884 --> 00:14:15,987
"HEY, LET'S PREPACKAGE OURSELVES
FOR THE SERIAL KILLER, HUH?

260
00:14:16,055 --> 00:14:18,256
        I CAN'T GET AWAY,
            CAN YOU?"

261
00:14:18,324 --> 00:14:20,391
    "I CAN HOP FOR A LITTLE,
    BUT I'M DEAD MEAT."

262
00:14:22,428 --> 00:14:24,762
    YOU EVER HAVE TO GO
  TO THE BATHROOM IN THE MIDDLE
          OF THE NIGHT?

263
00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:27,065
        YOU ALWAYS
      LOOK AT YOUR FRIENDS,
    "NICE KNOWING YOU.

264
00:14:27,132 --> 00:14:29,367
    ANYONE WANT TO COME
     AND GET KILLED WITH ME

265
00:14:29,435 --> 00:14:31,769
    OR YOU WANT TO GET KILLED
         LOOKING FOR ME?

266
00:14:31,837 --> 00:14:34,439
        WE'RE ALL DEAD."

267
00:14:34,506 --> 00:14:37,775
  IT'S NOT JUST SERIAL KILLERS.
    THERE'S BEARS OUT THERE.

268
00:14:37,843 --> 00:14:39,911
        LAST TIME I WENT
    I GOT THIS PAMPHLET

269
00:14:39,979 --> 00:14:43,848
 THAT SAID IF A BEAR APPROACHES
  YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO PLAY DEAD.

270
00:14:43,916 --> 00:14:46,718
             REALLY?
    WE'RE GONNA RELY ON
        MY ACTING SKILLS?

271
00:14:46,785 --> 00:14:49,187
        PLAY DEAD?

272
00:14:49,255 --> 00:14:51,890
     WHO CAME UP WITH THAT?
        MAYBE THE BEARS?

273
00:14:51,957 --> 00:14:54,559
        "PLAY DEAD,
    COVER YOURSELF IN HONEY,

274
00:14:54,627 --> 00:14:56,995
            CLIMB ON
      A LARGE WHITE PLATE.

275
00:14:57,062 --> 00:14:59,330
          DON'T TRY TO
    RUN AWAY FROM US--

276
00:14:59,398 --> 00:15:01,933
    I MEAN, THE BEARS."

277
00:15:03,469 --> 00:15:05,136
    HOW DOES THAT EVEN WORK?

278
00:15:05,204 --> 00:15:06,771
        "THERE'S A BEAR.
              UGH!

279
00:15:08,207 --> 00:15:10,842
     I HOPE THE BEAR THINKS
      WE DIE STANDING UP."

280
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:14,479
        AS IF BEARS HAVE
    SOME ETHICAL CODE:

281
00:15:14,546 --> 00:15:16,247
          "I DON'T MESS
        WITH DEAD BODIES.

282
00:15:16,315 --> 00:15:19,484
        I'M A BEAR,
         NOT AN ANIMAL."

283
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:22,053
        ( falsetto)
  THAT WAS THE WORST IMPRESSION
         OF A BEAR EVER.

284
00:15:22,121 --> 00:15:25,089
        PLAY DEAD.

285
00:15:25,157 --> 00:15:27,926
  I'M NOT SAYING THAT STRATEGY
        DIDN'T WORK ONCE.

286
00:15:27,993 --> 00:15:30,461
    BUT WHEN THEY FIND A BODY
  THAT'S BEEN MAULED BY A BEAR,

287
00:15:30,529 --> 00:15:33,097
    HOW DO THEY KNOW THAT GUY
      WASN'T PLAYING DEAD?

288
00:15:33,165 --> 00:15:36,567
          MAYBE HE WAS
         THE BEST AT IT.

289
00:15:36,635 --> 00:15:39,003
     AND THE BEAR WAS LIKE,
    "GREAT PERFORMANCE,

290
00:15:39,071 --> 00:15:41,572
        BUT I'M STARVING

291
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:44,275
        AND HE LOOKS LIKE
        A BURRITO."

292
00:15:44,343 --> 00:15:47,679
     WHY ARE WE EVEN CAMPING
WHERE THERE'S WILD ANIMALS?

293
00:15:47,746 --> 00:15:50,114
          THAT WOULDN'T
    BE A SELLING POINT
    FOR ANYTHING ELSE.

294
00:15:50,182 --> 00:15:52,016
        "IT'S A BEAUTIFUL
          GOLF COURSE,

295
00:15:52,084 --> 00:15:54,819
PLUS AROUND THE NINTH HOLE
THERE'S A PACK OF WOLVES.

296
00:15:54,887 --> 00:15:58,156
  IF THEY START RUNNING AT YOU,
    JUST PLAY THROUGH."

297
00:15:58,223 --> 00:16:00,925
         THE ONLY THING
      I LIKE TO DO OUTSIDE

298
00:16:00,993 --> 00:16:02,827
      IS LIE IN A HAMMOCK.

299
00:16:02,895 --> 00:16:04,996
        THAT'S ALL ABOUT
         DOING NOTHING.

300
00:16:05,064 --> 00:16:07,365
    IT'S HARD TO DO ANYTHING
    ONCE YOU GET IN A HAMMOCK

301
00:16:07,433 --> 00:16:09,434
    'CAUSE YOU CAN'T GET OUT.

302
00:16:09,501 --> 00:16:13,504
      IT'S LIKE A GIANT NET
    FOR CATCHING LAZY PEOPLE.

303
00:16:13,572 --> 00:16:16,007
          "I CAN'T EVEN
         DRINK IN THIS!"

304
00:16:16,075 --> 00:16:18,276
         ALL YOU CAN DO
            IS RELAX.

305
00:16:18,344 --> 00:16:20,778
      YOU NEVER SEE SOMEONE
      CRYING IN A HAMMOCK.

306
00:16:20,846 --> 00:16:23,381
          "MY LIFE IS--
    OH, THIS IS DELIGHTFUL."

307
00:16:25,017 --> 00:16:27,218
    YOU EVER GET IN A HAMMOCK
    WITH SOMEONE ELSE?

308
00:16:27,286 --> 00:16:29,620
          YOU'D BETTER
         BE DATING THEM,

309
00:16:29,688 --> 00:16:32,724
         'CAUSE IT LOOKS
    LIKE YOU'RE TRYING
    TO START A FAMILY.

310
00:16:32,791 --> 00:16:34,792
    I GOT IN A HAMMOCK
         WITH MY COUSIN,

311
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:37,495
            HE STILL
        WON'T TALK TO ME.

312
00:16:37,563 --> 00:16:39,897
          ( falsetto )
    HE MADE THE HAMMOCK
         A DIRTY THING.

313
00:16:48,107 --> 00:16:49,707
    I HAVE A NICE BED.

314
00:16:49,775 --> 00:16:52,076
         I DON'T BELIEVE
    IN MAKING THE BED THOUGH.

315
00:16:52,144 --> 00:16:54,679
     MY WIFE IS ALWAYS LIKE,
    "WHY DON'T YOU EVER
         MAKE THE BED?"

316
00:16:54,747 --> 00:16:58,416
      FOR THE SAME REASON
      I DON'T TIE MY SHOES
     AFTER I TAKE THEM OFF.

317
00:16:58,484 --> 00:17:01,719
     IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.

318
00:17:01,787 --> 00:17:05,289
            YOU KNOW?
        WE'RE NOT PUTTING
     THIS THING IN STORAGE.

319
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:10,328
  HELL, I'M HOPING TO COME BACK
      IN A COUPLE OF HOURS

320
00:17:10,396 --> 00:17:12,563
    AND I WOULD LIKE IT OPEN,

321
00:17:12,631 --> 00:17:14,399
        'CAUSE WHEN
         OUR BED IS MADE

322
00:17:14,466 --> 00:17:16,901
IT'S COVERED IN 40 PILLOWS

323
00:17:16,969 --> 00:17:18,970
        LIKE WE'RE
        STOCKPILING AMMO

324
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:21,672
         FOR THE GLOBAL
         PILLOW FIGHT.

325
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:24,175
    I ASK MY WIFE, I'M LIKE,
    "WHAT'S THE DEAL WITH ALL
         THESE PILLOWS?"

326
00:17:24,243 --> 00:17:26,277
    "THEY'RE FOR DECORATION."

327
00:17:26,345 --> 00:17:29,714
    HOW OFTEN ARE YOU GIVING
     A TOUR OF OUR BEDROOM?

328
00:17:29,782 --> 00:17:32,784
    AND HAS ANYONE EVER BEEN
      IMPRESSED BY PILLOWS?

329
00:17:32,851 --> 00:17:35,119
      LIKE SOMEONE'S GONNA
      LEAVE YOUR BEDROOM,

330
00:17:35,187 --> 00:17:36,954
         "I DIDN'T KNOW
THEY WERE DOING THAT WELL.

331
00:17:39,324 --> 00:17:42,226
  THEY GOT LIKE 40, 50 PILLOWS
          ON THAT BED.

332
00:17:42,294 --> 00:17:45,196
    THEY'RE ROLLING IN DOWN."

333
00:17:45,264 --> 00:17:49,033
          ( falsetto )
     PILLOW JOKES?  REALLY?
    IS THAT WHAT HE'S DOING?

334
00:17:49,101 --> 00:17:52,136
      I DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS
      GOING TO BE SO EDGY.

335
00:17:52,204 --> 00:17:55,406
    I DIDN'T COME HERE
  TO BE SHOCKED INTO LAUGHTER.

336
00:17:55,474 --> 00:17:57,675
        EXCUSE ME.

337
00:17:59,611 --> 00:18:02,613
     I HAD A BED DAY TODAY.
        YOU EVER HANG OUT
         IN BED ALL DAY?

338
00:18:02,681 --> 00:18:05,383
        ANYONE ELSE
         DO HEROIN?  NO?

339
00:18:05,451 --> 00:18:07,518
          ( falsetto )
        THAT'S NOT FUNNY.

340
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:09,554
         THOSE BED DAYS
          ARE THE BEST.

341
00:18:09,621 --> 00:18:11,889
     PEOPLE RARELY VOLUNTEER
        THAT INFORMATION.

342
00:18:11,957 --> 00:18:15,359
        "SORRY I'M LATE.
     I DIDN'T GET OUT OF BED
        UNTIL 5:00 P.M."

343
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:18,496
      "OH, WERE YOU SICK?"
      "NO, I WAS IN HEAVEN.

344
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:23,668
     JUST FANTASIZING ABOUT
        BEING IN A COMA."

345
00:18:23,735 --> 00:18:25,269
        BREAKFAST IN BED.

346
00:18:25,337 --> 00:18:27,672
        BREAKFAST IN BED,
    THAT IS A FANTASY.

347
00:18:27,739 --> 00:18:31,609
 'CAUSE IT GIVES YOU THE OPTION
     OF GOING BACK TO SLEEP
        WHEN YOU'RE DONE.

348
00:18:31,677 --> 00:18:34,212
        "IT WOULD BE RUDE
         TO EAT AND RUN.

349
00:18:35,914 --> 00:18:38,449
     I SHOULD STICK AROUND,
  SEE IF THERE'S LUNCH IN BED."

350
00:18:40,085 --> 00:18:43,087
    AND EATING WHILE YOU'RE
    LYING DOWN IS BEAUTIFUL.

351
00:18:43,155 --> 00:18:46,157
     TOO BAD HOSPITALS HAVE
THAT SICKNESS REQUIREMENT,

352
00:18:46,225 --> 00:18:49,160
         'CAUSE I WOULD
        CHECK IN <i>MANANA.</i>

353
00:18:49,228 --> 00:18:50,828
    "WHAT ARE YOUR SYMPTOMS?"

354
00:18:50,896 --> 00:18:53,064
     "I'M HUNGRY AND I COULD
          GO FOR A NAP.

355
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:55,633
             STAT."

356
00:18:55,701 --> 00:18:58,769
 OF COURSE WHAT MAKES BREAKFAST
        IN BED SO SPECIAL

357
00:18:58,837 --> 00:19:01,139
      IS YOU'RE LYING DOWN
    AND EATING BACON--

358
00:19:01,206 --> 00:19:04,475
    THE MOST BEAUTIFUL
         THING ON EARTH.

359
00:19:04,543 --> 00:19:07,044
         - ( cheering )
         - BACON.

360
00:19:09,448 --> 00:19:10,982
        BACON'S THE BEST.

361
00:19:11,049 --> 00:19:13,618
    EVEN THE FRYING OF BACON
      SOUNDS LIKE APPLAUSE.

362
00:19:13,685 --> 00:19:15,686
          IT'S LIKE...
      ( imitates applause )

363
00:19:15,754 --> 00:19:19,090
        YAY, BACON!

364
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:21,125
        YOU WANT TO KNOW
    HOW GOOD BACON IS?

365
00:19:21,193 --> 00:19:24,462
     TO IMPROVE OTHER FOOD
     THEY WRAP IT IN BACON.

366
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:26,597
    IF IT WEREN'T FOR BACON,

367
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:29,700
      WE WOULDN'T EVEN KNOW
    WHAT A WATER CHESTNUT IS.

368
00:19:29,768 --> 00:19:33,437
    "THANK YOU, BACON.
 SINCERELY, WATER CHESTNUT III."

369
00:19:34,573 --> 00:19:36,474
    AND THOSE BITS OF BACON?

370
00:19:36,542 --> 00:19:39,777
        BITS OF BACON ARE
    LIKE THE FAIRY DUST
     OF THE FOOD COMMUNITY.

371
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:41,345
         YOU DON'T WANT
    THIS BAKED POTATO?

372
00:19:41,413 --> 00:19:43,548
            BRRRING!

373
00:19:43,615 --> 00:19:45,917
     NOW IT'S YOUR FAVORITE
        PART OF THE MEAL.

374
00:19:45,984 --> 00:19:47,752
NOT INTERESTED IN A SALAD?

375
00:19:47,819 --> 00:19:50,955
     BIPPITY-BOPPITY BACON!

376
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:53,424
        I JUST TURNED IT
        INTO AN ENTREE.

377
00:19:53,492 --> 00:19:55,993
     BUT ONCE YOU PUT BACON
        IN A SALAD

378
00:19:56,061 --> 00:19:57,828
     IT'S NO LONGER A SALAD.

379
00:19:57,896 --> 00:20:00,965
    IT JUST BECOMES A GAME OF
 FIND THE BACON IN THE LETTUCE.

380
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:02,967
        IT'S LIKE YOU'RE
        PANNING FOR GOLD.

381
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:05,102
            "EUREKA!

382
00:20:05,170 --> 00:20:07,271
             BACON!"

383
00:20:07,339 --> 00:20:10,074
        NOT TOO MANY WAYS
        TO PREPARE BACON.

384
00:20:10,142 --> 00:20:13,678
      YOU CAN EITHER FRY IT
        OR GET BOTULISM.

385
00:20:13,745 --> 00:20:15,880
IT'S AMAZING THE SHRINKAGE
          THAT OCCURS.

386
00:20:15,948 --> 00:20:19,116
     YOU START WITH A POUND,
YOU END UP WITH A BOOKMARK.

387
00:20:19,184 --> 00:20:21,619
    REALLY THE ONLY BAD PART
        ABOUT BACON

388
00:20:21,687 --> 00:20:25,089
     IS IT MAKES YOU THIRSTY
         FOR MORE BACON.

389
00:20:25,157 --> 00:20:27,725
        I NEVER FEEL LIKE
    I GET ENOUGH BACON.

390
00:20:27,793 --> 00:20:30,127
     AT BREAKFAST IT'S LIKE
     THEY'RE RATIONING IT.

391
00:20:30,195 --> 00:20:32,296
          "HERE'S YOUR
      TWO STRIPS OF BACON."

392
00:20:32,364 --> 00:20:34,565
          "I WANT MORE!

393
00:20:34,633 --> 00:20:36,500
          MORE BACON!"

394
00:20:36,568 --> 00:20:38,402
         WHENEVER YOU'RE
    AT A BRUNCH BUFFET

395
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:41,539
        AND YOU SEE THAT
      BIG METAL TRAY FILLED
 WITH THE 4,000 PIECES OF BACON,

396
00:20:41,607 --> 00:20:44,742
     DON'T YOU ALMOST EXPECT
     A RAINBOW TO BE COMING
        OUT OF IT?

397
00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:48,179
          "I FOUND IT!
    I FOUND THE SOURCE
         OF ALL BACON!"

398
00:20:50,616 --> 00:20:53,351
    THAT BACON TRAY IS ALWAYS
    AT THE END OF THE BUFFET.

399
00:20:53,418 --> 00:20:55,219
    YOU REGRET ALL THE STUFF
         ON YOUR PLATE.

400
00:20:56,922 --> 00:21:00,391
        "WHAT AM I DOING
 WITH ALL THIS WORTHLESS FRUIT?

401
00:21:00,459 --> 00:21:02,827
      I SHOULD HAVE WAITED.

402
00:21:02,894 --> 00:21:06,397
  IF I HAD KNOWN YOU WERE HERE,
      I WOULD HAVE WAITED.

403
00:21:06,465 --> 00:21:09,567
        I WOULD EAT
        ONLY YOU, BACON."

404
00:21:09,635 --> 00:21:12,603
  BUT YOU CAN'T EAT ONLY BACON
  'CAUSE IT'S TERRIBLE FOR YOU.

405
00:21:12,671 --> 00:21:16,073
      YOU KNOW BACON IS BAD
     WHEN A HEALTHIER CHOICE
        IS A DONUT.

406
00:21:17,576 --> 00:21:19,710
BACON IS LIKE THE OPPOSITE
          OF MEDICINE.

407
00:21:19,778 --> 00:21:22,313
        IT'S LIKE,
      "TAKE THAT, LIPITOR.
        I'M BACON."

408
00:21:24,316 --> 00:21:27,718
    WE'VE KNOWN BACON IS BAD
 FOR US FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS.

409
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:30,588
  IT'S LITERALLY A RESTRICTION
 ON ENTERING CERTAIN RELIGIONS.

410
00:21:30,656 --> 00:21:33,291
     "OUR RULES: NO KILLING,
    NO CHEATING ON YOUR WIFE,
        NO BACON--"

411
00:21:33,358 --> 00:21:37,628
        "WHOA WHOA WHOA.
    WHAT WAS THAT LAST ONE?"

412
00:21:37,696 --> 00:21:39,130
        "NO BACON."

413
00:21:39,197 --> 00:21:41,299
     "I'M IN THE WRONG LINE.

414
00:21:41,366 --> 00:21:44,402
      IS THERE A BACON LINE
          AROUND HERE?"

415
00:21:44,469 --> 00:21:47,938
          ( falsetto )
      HOW MANY BACON JOKES
      IS THIS GUY GONNA DO?

416
00:21:48,006 --> 00:21:50,408
      I MEAN, I LIKE BACON,
          BUT COME ON.

417
00:21:52,444 --> 00:21:54,612
        THE PIG IS
    AN AMAZING ANIMAL.

418
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:57,315
    YOU FEED A PIG AN APPLE,
         IT MAKES BACON.

419
00:21:57,382 --> 00:21:59,917
     I FIND THAT IMPRESSIVE.

420
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:02,720
    LET'S SEE MICHAEL PHELPS
          DO THAT, HUH?

421
00:22:02,788 --> 00:22:04,522
          ( cheering )

422
00:22:07,025 --> 00:22:10,461
      THE PIG-- THE PIG IS
    TURNING AN APPLE--

423
00:22:10,529 --> 00:22:13,230
      ESSENTIALLY GARBAGE--

424
00:22:13,298 --> 00:22:15,199
        INTO BACON.

425
00:22:15,267 --> 00:22:16,901
          THAT'S MAGIC,

426
00:22:16,968 --> 00:22:19,970
     OR THE MOST SUCCESSFUL
     RECYCLING PROGRAM <i>EVER.</i>

427
00:22:20,038 --> 00:22:22,640
         REALLY, THE PIG
      IS MAN'S BEST FRIEND.

428
00:22:22,708 --> 00:22:25,276
          I LOVE DOGS,
        BUT PIGS WOULD BE
        GOOD COMPANIONS.

429
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:27,511
    THEN WHEN THEY DIE,
YOU COULD HAVE A BARBECUE.

430
00:22:27,579 --> 00:22:29,313
      "SORRY YOUR PIG DIED.

431
00:22:29,381 --> 00:22:31,682
        CAN I COME OVER
        FOR BREAKFAST...

432
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:35,219
      AND HAVE SOME BACON?"

433
00:22:35,287 --> 00:22:36,787
    BACON IS THAT GOOD.

434
00:22:36,855 --> 00:22:38,956
 I BET IF YOU PUT BITS OF BACON
      ON A STRIP OF BACON,

435
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:41,192
        YOU COULD TRAVEL
          BACK IN TIME.

436
00:22:41,259 --> 00:22:44,328
            IT'S LIKE
         A TASTY VORTEX.

437
00:22:44,396 --> 00:22:46,397
      BE KIND OF REDUNDANT
             FOR ME

438
00:22:46,465 --> 00:22:49,200
'CAUSE I WOULD JUST TRAVEL
BACK TO WHEN I WAS EATING BACON.

439
00:22:49,267 --> 00:22:53,804
  IT WOULD BE A BACON-TO-BACON
      TIME-SPACE CONTINUUM.

440
00:22:53,872 --> 00:22:55,740
          ( falsetto )
    THAT'S A NERDY-ASS
        BACON JOKE.

441
00:22:58,043 --> 00:23:01,879
  FATBACK-- SUPPOSEDLY FATBACK
IS LIKE BACON ON STEROIDS.

442
00:23:01,947 --> 00:23:03,714
    I'VE NEVER TRIED FATBACK,

443
00:23:03,782 --> 00:23:05,850
         PROBABLY 'CAUSE
      IT'S CALLED <i>FATBACK.</i>

444
00:23:07,619 --> 00:23:09,620
     I DON'T KNOW WHICH WORD
      CREEPS ME OUT MORE--

445
00:23:09,688 --> 00:23:11,689
          FAT OR BACK.

446
00:23:11,757 --> 00:23:14,892
  WHY DON'T THEY JUST THROW IN
  "HAIRY" WHILE THEY'RE AT IT?

447
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:18,729
     "THIS IS SOME DELICIOUS
         HAIRY FATBACK.

448
00:23:18,797 --> 00:23:21,565
        THAT REMINDS ME--
    YOUR UNCLE CALLED."

449
00:23:23,502 --> 00:23:26,337
          ( falsetto )
     THAT'S GOTTA BE THE END
    OF THE BACON JOKES.

450
00:23:26,405 --> 00:23:29,173
        I EVEN LIKE
         THE NAME BACON.

451
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:32,410
        YOU CAN'T TELL ME
THE SUCCESS OF KEVIN BACON

452
00:23:32,477 --> 00:23:35,112
    ISN'T SOMEHOW TIED
          TO HIS NAME.

453
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:37,948
          ( cheering )

454
00:23:38,016 --> 00:23:40,918
YOU'RE NOT GOING OUT TO SEE
     A KEVIN HOT-DOG MOVIE.

455
00:23:40,986 --> 00:23:43,421
      "WHO'S IN THIS MOVIE?
          KEVIN BACON?

456
00:23:43,488 --> 00:23:45,689
          SOUNDS GOOD."

457
00:23:45,757 --> 00:23:48,859
             BACON!
    I LIKE MEAT, I DO.

458
00:23:48,927 --> 00:23:51,929
    I LIKE ALL KINDS OF MEAT,
          EVEN BOLOGNA.

459
00:23:51,997 --> 00:23:54,265
          ( falsetto )
I KNEW HE WAS WHITE TRASH.

460
00:23:57,436 --> 00:23:59,470
        I DON'T EVEN KNOW
      IF BOLOGNA IS A MEAT.

461
00:23:59,538 --> 00:24:02,306
  I DON'T THINK MEAT'S SUPPOSED
TO CATCH ON FIRE LIKE THAT.

462
00:24:04,810 --> 00:24:08,279
    WHAT'S INTERESTING
    ABOUT BOLOGNA-- IT'S NOT
  JUST A MEAT, IT'S AN INSULT.

463
00:24:08,346 --> 00:24:11,849
"THAT'S A BUNCH OF BOLOGNA.
    YOU'RE FULL OF BOLOGNA."

464
00:24:11,917 --> 00:24:15,286
      THAT KIND OF IMPLIES
     BOLOGNA MAKES YOU LIE.

465
00:24:15,353 --> 00:24:16,954
          I EAT BOLOGNA
         ALL THE TIME...

466
00:24:17,022 --> 00:24:19,557
        OR MAYBE I DON'T.

467
00:24:19,624 --> 00:24:22,827
        MAYBE THAT'S JUST
      THE BOLOGNA TALKING.

468
00:24:24,463 --> 00:24:27,031
HAVE YOU SEEN THE BOLOGNA
THAT HAS THE OLIVES IN IT?

469
00:24:27,098 --> 00:24:29,967
        WHO IS THAT FOR?

470
00:24:30,035 --> 00:24:32,703
    "I LIKE MY BOLOGNA
        LIKE A MARTINI--

471
00:24:32,771 --> 00:24:35,105
         WITH AN OLIVE."

472
00:24:35,173 --> 00:24:37,575
            I'LL HAVE
  THE BOLOGNA SANDWICH, DIRTY.

473
00:24:42,948 --> 00:24:44,882
        EVERYTHING ABOUT
        BOLOGNA IS SILLY.

474
00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:47,718
WHO DECIDED ON THE PRONUNCIATION
     OF THE WORD "BOLOGNA"?

475
00:24:47,786 --> 00:24:50,921
"ALL RIGHT, HOW DO YOU WANT
    TO PRONOUNCE THIS WORD?"
        "BALONEY!"

476
00:24:50,989 --> 00:24:54,124
    "I DON'T KNOW IF YOU SAW,
THERE'S A 'G' IN THE WORD."

477
00:24:54,192 --> 00:24:57,027
          "I DON'T SEE
      NO 'G' IN 'BALONEY.'"

478
00:24:57,095 --> 00:24:59,029
         "OKAY, THE WORD
     DOES END WITH AN 'A.'"

479
00:24:59,097 --> 00:25:00,698
          "WE'RE GOING
         WITH 'BALONEY'!

480
00:25:00,765 --> 00:25:02,500
    TRUST ME, I CAME UP
        WITH 'COLONEL.'"

481
00:25:12,043 --> 00:25:14,178
        I AM TRYING TO BE
        MORE RESPONSIBLE.

482
00:25:14,246 --> 00:25:16,447
        I'M A FATHER NOW.
          THAT'S RIGHT.

483
00:25:16,515 --> 00:25:18,883
    I BECAME A PRIEST.
        THANK YOU.

484
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:20,317
        BLESS YOU.

485
00:25:22,487 --> 00:25:24,188
    IT'S INTERESTING.
    WHEN I WAS SINGLE,

486
00:25:24,256 --> 00:25:26,156
    I NEVER REALLY SAW MYSELF
        AS A FAMILY MAN,

487
00:25:26,224 --> 00:25:27,791
    BUT NOW THAT I'M MARRIED

488
00:25:27,859 --> 00:25:29,527
         AND I HAVE TWO
    BEAUTIFUL CHILDREN,

489
00:25:29,594 --> 00:25:31,095
        IT'S REALLY
    MADE ME APPRECIATE

490
00:25:31,162 --> 00:25:32,997
          BEING ALONE.

491
00:25:33,064 --> 00:25:35,099
        IT'S HARD.

492
00:25:35,166 --> 00:25:37,768
    MY DAUGHTER'S FOUR.
          MY SON'S TWO.

493
00:25:37,836 --> 00:25:39,537
        I TELL YOU
         IT'S EXHAUSTING

494
00:25:39,604 --> 00:25:42,006
        WATCHING MY WIFE
        DO ALL THAT WORK.

495
00:25:42,073 --> 00:25:44,241
        SHE SHOULD
         GET SOME HELP.

496
00:25:44,309 --> 00:25:47,011
        I CAN BARELY NAP
     THROUGH THE SCREAMING.

497
00:25:49,047 --> 00:25:50,814
          MY WIFE DOES
         DO EVERYTHING.

498
00:25:50,882 --> 00:25:53,517
      IT'S HARD TO COMPLAIN
        AROUND THE MOTHER
        OF A SMALL CHILD.

499
00:25:53,585 --> 00:25:55,553
    "YEAH, I DIDN'T GET
     MUCH SLEEP LAST NIGHT."

500
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:57,988
        "OH REALLY?
      I SLEPT FOR A MINUTE.

501
00:25:58,056 --> 00:26:00,724
     AND I WAS BREASTFEEDING
      DURING THAT MINUTE."

502
00:26:02,394 --> 00:26:04,495
         "THAT'S ROUGH.
     CAN YOU GET ME A BEER?"

503
00:26:06,598 --> 00:26:08,265
          ( falsetto )
          HE IS A JERK.

504
00:26:10,001 --> 00:26:11,902
TELL YA, EXPLAINING THINGS
        TO MY KIDS

505
00:26:11,970 --> 00:26:14,371
        MAKES ME REALIZE
    HOW LITTLE I KNOW.

506
00:26:14,439 --> 00:26:17,107
     RECENTLY MY SON POINTED
     TO AN ANTENNA AND SAID,
      "LOOK, DADDY, STICK!"

507
00:26:17,175 --> 00:26:19,209
    I SAID, "ACTUALLY,
    THAT'S AN ANTENNA"

508
00:26:19,277 --> 00:26:23,280
            HE GOES,
      "WHAT'S AN ANTENNA?"
         "IT'S A STICK.

509
00:26:23,348 --> 00:26:26,383
      IT'S A SILVER STICK.
     YOU NAILED IT, BUDDY."

510
00:26:26,451 --> 00:26:28,485
    I ALWAYS FEEL DUMB.

511
00:26:28,553 --> 00:26:31,722
      IT DOESN'T HELP THAT
    MY WIFE SPELLS EVERYTHING
      IN FRONT OF MY KIDS.

512
00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:35,426
    "DON'T TELL ANYONE ABOUT
      THE I-C-E-C-R-E-A-M."

513
00:26:35,493 --> 00:26:38,395
            "WHO'S IN
    THE EMERGENCY ROOM?

514
00:26:38,463 --> 00:26:40,931
        AND WHY DO I WANT
          A DILLY BAR?"

515
00:26:43,268 --> 00:26:46,503
      'CAUSE YOU CAN'T SAY
      THE WORDS "ICE CREAM"
  IN FRONT OF A FOUR-YEAR-OLD.

516
00:26:46,571 --> 00:26:49,206
     THEY HEAR A COMMITMENT.
  "YEAH, I'LL HAVE ICE CREAM."

517
00:26:49,274 --> 00:26:51,809
     "DADDY WAS JUST SAYING
     THE WORDS 'ICE CREAM.'"

518
00:26:51,876 --> 00:26:54,578
    "I'LL HAVE IT RIGHT NOW.
        CHOCOLATE."

519
00:26:56,414 --> 00:26:58,682
I WENT TO A BIRTHDAY PARTY
      FOR A FOUR-YEAR-OLD.

520
00:26:58,750 --> 00:27:00,651
    THAT WAS AWKWARD...

521
00:27:00,719 --> 00:27:04,321
         PROBABLY 'CAUSE
        I WASN'T INVITED.

522
00:27:04,389 --> 00:27:07,858
    THE CAKE CAME OUT.
    I LOVE HOW WE SERVE
      ICE CREAM WITH CAKE.

523
00:27:07,926 --> 00:27:11,295
    "YOU KNOW WHAT'D BE GOOD
     WITH THIS SUGAR BREAD?
     SOME FROZEN SUGAR MILK.

524
00:27:11,363 --> 00:27:13,998
          LET'S GIVE IT
     TO THE FOUR-YEAR-OLDS,
     SEE HOW THEY RESPOND.

525
00:27:15,467 --> 00:27:17,001
      THEY'RE GOING CRAZY."

526
00:27:20,639 --> 00:27:23,207
      MY SON'S BEEN WALKING
          FOR A WHILE.

527
00:27:23,274 --> 00:27:25,509
          IT'S AMAZING.
BABIES, THEY LEARN TO WALK

528
00:27:25,577 --> 00:27:27,645
    AND THEY'RE ALREADY
    TRYING TO GET AWAY.

529
00:27:27,712 --> 00:27:29,780
    "TIME FOR A BATH."
    ( mimics laughter )

530
00:27:31,683 --> 00:27:35,185
      "WHERE ARE YOU GOING?
WHAT, YOU GOT AN ESCAPE CAR
            OUTSIDE?

531
00:27:35,253 --> 00:27:37,554
  YOU CAN'T REACH THE DOORKNOB,
        YOU ONLY KNOW US;

532
00:27:37,622 --> 00:27:39,156
    WHAT'S YOUR PLAN?"

533
00:27:40,825 --> 00:27:42,326
        THINK IT THROUGH,
             BUDDY.

534
00:27:43,461 --> 00:27:44,828
        THINK IT THROUGH.

535
00:27:50,435 --> 00:27:53,437
'COURSE IF YOU HAVE A BOY,
YOU HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE
     CIRCUMCISION QUESTION.

536
00:27:53,505 --> 00:27:56,774
      MEN LOVE THAT TOPIC.
      "COULD YOU TALK ABOUT
         SOMETHING ELSE

537
00:27:56,841 --> 00:27:58,809
        LIKE PRISON RAPE?
        ANYTHING."

538
00:28:01,646 --> 00:28:03,580
         "CIRCUMCISION"
        IS A SCARY WORD.

539
00:28:03,648 --> 00:28:05,849
         I LOOKED IT UP
    IN THE DICTIONARY.
    IT JUST SAID "OW!

540
00:28:05,917 --> 00:28:09,319
    FROM THE LATIN FOR 'AH!'"

541
00:28:09,387 --> 00:28:11,088
     WE WENT THROUGH WITH IT

542
00:28:11,156 --> 00:28:12,856
    ONLY 'CAUSE MY SON
          REQUESTED IT.

543
00:28:15,093 --> 00:28:18,996
      IT IS PRETTY CRAZY.
      OBVIOUSLY IT STARTED
    AS A RELIGIOUS TRADITION,

544
00:28:19,064 --> 00:28:21,632
          CIRCUMCISION,
    BUT HOW'D THEY EVEN
     COME UP WITH THE IDEA?

545
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:24,068
    WERE THERE A BUNCH
  OF RELIGIOUS LEADERS GATHERED

546
00:28:24,135 --> 00:28:27,104
      AND ONE GUY WAS LIKE,
      "ALL RIGHT, HOW SHALL
         WE HONOR GOD?"

547
00:28:27,172 --> 00:28:29,473
      ANOTHER ONE'S GOING,
"I SAY WE DON'T EAT PORK."

548
00:28:29,541 --> 00:28:31,542
         "I DON'T KNOW.
         I LIKE BACON.

549
00:28:31,609 --> 00:28:33,210
        ANYONE GOT
         ANYTHING ELSE?"

550
00:28:33,278 --> 00:28:34,912
    "WHAT IF WE CUT OFF
    PART OF OUR PENIS?"

551
00:28:41,119 --> 00:28:42,986
      "ALL RIGHT, NO PORK.
        WE'LL GO NO PORK.

552
00:28:44,756 --> 00:28:47,558
             I WANT
    THAT MAN <i>REMOVED!"</i>

553
00:28:52,330 --> 00:28:54,298
         MY WIFE TOLD ME
        THAT IN THE BIBLE

554
00:28:54,365 --> 00:28:56,533
             ABRAHAM
      CIRCUMCISED HIMSELF.

555
00:28:56,601 --> 00:28:58,736
              WOW.

556
00:28:58,803 --> 00:29:01,839
  I CAN'T EVEN GET TO THE BANK
        BEFORE IT CLOSES.

557
00:29:03,908 --> 00:29:06,276
         ABRAHAM DID IT.
     GOD TOLD HIM TO DO IT.

558
00:29:06,344 --> 00:29:08,879
        I WOULD'VE LOVED
    TO HAVE OVERHEARD
    THAT CONVERSATION.

559
00:29:08,947 --> 00:29:11,115
        "ABRAHAM."
          "OH HEY, GOD.
    HOW ARE YOU DOING?"

560
00:29:11,182 --> 00:29:13,751
        "I NEED YOU TO DO
    SOMETHING FOR ME."
    "SURE, YOU'RE GOD."

561
00:29:13,818 --> 00:29:16,253
         "I NEED YOU TO
      CIRCUMCISE YOURSELF."

562
00:29:16,321 --> 00:29:18,322
         "I THINK WE GOT
        A BAD CONNECTION.

563
00:29:18,389 --> 00:29:21,992
COULD YOU SEND ME AN EMAIL?
    ARE YOU ON FACEBOOK YET?"

564
00:29:23,628 --> 00:29:25,896
I TELL YOU THOSE CHALLENGES
          IN THE BIBLE

565
00:29:25,964 --> 00:29:27,631
        TOOK A LEAP
         IN DIFFICULTY.

566
00:29:27,699 --> 00:29:30,434
     "DON'T EAT THIS APPLE.
        BUILD ME A BOAT.

567
00:29:30,502 --> 00:29:33,504
          CUT OFF PART
         OF YOUR PENIS."

568
00:29:33,571 --> 00:29:35,539
      "WHAT IF I BUILD YOU
        TWO BOATS?"

569
00:29:37,575 --> 00:29:39,576
         HOW DID ABRAHAM
    EVEN TELL HIS WIFE?

570
00:29:39,644 --> 00:29:42,246
        MAYBE HE DIDN'T.
    HE WAS JUST GETTING
    OUT OF THE SHOWER,

571
00:29:42,313 --> 00:29:44,281
          SHE WAS LIKE,
         "WHAT THE HELL
         HAVE YOU DONE?"

572
00:29:44,349 --> 00:29:47,684
             "HONEY,
         I CAN EXPLAIN.

573
00:29:47,752 --> 00:29:50,621
     GOD TOLD ME TO DO IT."

574
00:29:50,688 --> 00:29:53,390
        "IF GOD TOLD YOU
     TO JUMP OFF A BRIDGE--

575
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:56,026
         IF GOD TOLD YOU
    TO SACRIFICE OUR FIRST--"

576
00:29:56,094 --> 00:29:58,162
    "ACTUALLY, I HAVE TO TALK
     TO YOU ABOUT THAT ONE."

577
00:30:02,033 --> 00:30:04,234
         YEAH, ABRAHAM,
  HE WENT THROUGH THE WRINGER.

578
00:30:04,302 --> 00:30:07,304
    IT'S NOT LIKE JESUS
     HAD A CAKEWALK THOUGH.

579
00:30:07,372 --> 00:30:10,507
YOU THINK JESUS EVER TRIED
     TO TALK GOD OUT OF SOME
         OF THAT STUFF?

580
00:30:10,575 --> 00:30:13,110
 "HEY, DAD, YOU KNOW THAT WHOLE
    CRUCIFIXION THING?"

581
00:30:13,178 --> 00:30:15,879
 "YES, YOU'RE DYING ON THE CROSS
    FOR ALL MANKIND'S SINS."

582
00:30:15,947 --> 00:30:17,948
    "YEAH YEAH, HEAR ME OUT.

583
00:30:19,651 --> 00:30:23,220
     WHAT IF INSTEAD OF THAT
    WE DID A BIG FUNDRAISER?"

584
00:30:25,023 --> 00:30:27,691
     "NO.  NOW GET CRACKING
    ON YOUR MIRACLES."

585
00:30:27,759 --> 00:30:30,260
         JESUS PERFORMED
        SO MANY MIRACLES.

586
00:30:30,328 --> 00:30:33,564
DO YOU THINK THE CARPENTRY
    EVER CAME UP WHEN HE WAS
    DOING THE MIRACLES?

587
00:30:33,631 --> 00:30:36,233
    "JESUS, IF YOU COULD CURE
      OUR SON'S BLINDNESS--

588
00:30:36,301 --> 00:30:38,735
    AND WE'D LOVE SOME
    SHELVES RIGHT HERE.

589
00:30:38,803 --> 00:30:42,239
    I DON'T KNOW IF YOU
    WANT TO DO THE BLINDNESS,
        THEN THE SHELVES.

590
00:30:42,307 --> 00:30:44,675
    WE NEED THE SHELVES
        BY TUESDAY.

591
00:30:44,742 --> 00:30:47,778
OF COURSE WE'D LOVE OUR SON
     TO SEE THOSE SHELVES."

592
00:30:59,991 --> 00:31:02,459
     POPEYE'S IS MY FAVORITE
         FRIED CHICKEN.

593
00:31:02,527 --> 00:31:04,862
        I LOVE POPEYE'S.
        I LOVE THAT NAME.

594
00:31:04,929 --> 00:31:07,297
         "OH, I GET IT.
    POPEYE WAS A SAILOR

595
00:31:07,365 --> 00:31:09,466
    AND YOUR FOOD GOES
THROUGH ME LIKE A TORPEDO.

596
00:31:11,135 --> 00:31:13,637
        THAT MAKES SENSE.

597
00:31:13,705 --> 00:31:17,341
    POPEYE ATE SPINACH
    AND NOW I HAVE DYSENTERY.

598
00:31:19,077 --> 00:31:21,511
    POPEYE HAD MUSCLES;
    I CAN'T STAND UP."

599
00:31:23,314 --> 00:31:26,283
 MAYBE THEY'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT
  THE CARTOON CHARACTER POPEYE.

600
00:31:26,351 --> 00:31:29,586
MAYBE THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT
    WHAT HAPPENS TO YOUR EYES
     AFTER YOU EAT THE FOOD.

601
00:31:32,190 --> 00:31:34,091
        "I GOTTA GO
        TO THE BATHROOM."

602
00:31:38,997 --> 00:31:41,031
I EAT THE FAST FOOD, I DO.

603
00:31:41,099 --> 00:31:43,834
  IT'S AMAZING HOW OUR ATTITUDE
      ON FAST FOOD CHANGES.

604
00:31:43,902 --> 00:31:46,069
        WHEN YOU'RE A KID
    IT'S YOUR FAVORITE PLACE,

605
00:31:46,137 --> 00:31:47,905
         BUT AS AN ADULT
      YOU LOOK AT FAST FOOD

606
00:31:47,972 --> 00:31:50,107
          LIKE SOMEONE
        YOU USED TO DATE.

607
00:31:50,174 --> 00:31:52,676
        "I CAN'T BELIEVE
    I EVER WENT THERE."

608
00:31:54,812 --> 00:31:56,847
      THEN THE NEXT NIGHT,
      "WELL, IT'S LATE...

609
00:31:58,950 --> 00:32:00,317
      AND I'M DRUNK SO..."

610
00:32:03,054 --> 00:32:05,289
    WE'RE ALL SO EMBARRASSED
        TO EAT FAST FOOD.

611
00:32:05,356 --> 00:32:07,658
      YOU EVER GO IN THERE,
    EVERYONE'S SITTING
         BY THEMSELVES,

612
00:32:07,725 --> 00:32:09,092
      THEY'RE HUNCHED OVER

613
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:11,862
    WEARING A SKI MASK?

614
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:14,197
    "DON'T TELL MY WIFE
        I'M HERE!"

615
00:32:14,265 --> 00:32:17,134
THEY KNOW WE'RE EMBARRASSED
        TO EAT FAST FOOD.

616
00:32:17,201 --> 00:32:19,169
    THAT'S WHY THEY INVENTED
         THE DRIVE-THRU.

617
00:32:19,237 --> 00:32:21,471
  "LOOK, NO ONE HAS TO SEE YOU.
     JUST DRIVE AROUND BACK.

618
00:32:21,539 --> 00:32:23,307
          WE'LL HAND IT
        OUT THE WINDOW."

619
00:32:33,618 --> 00:32:35,886
        THAT DRIVE-THRU'S
    PRETTY CONVENIENT, RIGHT?

620
00:32:35,954 --> 00:32:37,888
  EXCEPT FOR THAT FINAL STRETCH
         FOR YOUR FOOD.

621
00:32:37,956 --> 00:32:40,157
YOU'RE LIKE, "CAN YOU BRING
      YOUR BUILDING CLOSER

622
00:32:40,224 --> 00:32:42,893
        TO MY CAR?
DO I HAVE TO DO EVERYTHING?

623
00:32:42,961 --> 00:32:46,296
    WHAT A PAIN IN THE ASS!"

624
00:32:46,364 --> 00:32:50,834
          ( falsetto )
     WHY IS HE REACHING OUT
 THE PASSENGER SIDE OF THE CAR?

625
00:32:50,902 --> 00:32:53,737
     THESE FAST FOOD PLACES
     ARE SO FAST AND EASY,

626
00:32:53,805 --> 00:32:56,306
        THEY'VE RUINED ME
    FOR REGULAR RESTAURANTS.

627
00:32:56,374 --> 00:32:58,942
         WHENEVER I'M IN
      A REGULAR RESTAURANT,
        I'M ALWAYS LIKE,

628
00:32:59,010 --> 00:33:02,045
      "LET'S SEE.  I WILL
      ORDER THE HAMBURGER.
          WHERE IS IT?"

629
00:33:03,915 --> 00:33:06,917
    "SIR, HOW WOULD YOU LIKE
      YOUR HAMBURGER DONE?"

630
00:33:06,985 --> 00:33:09,152
          "RIGHT NOW.
          WHERE IS IT?

631
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:10,687
    AND CAN YOU WRAP IT
            IN PAPER

632
00:33:10,755 --> 00:33:13,390
         SO I FEEL LIKE
     I'M OPENING A PRESENT?

633
00:33:13,458 --> 00:33:15,826
         OR MAYBE PUT IT
    IN A STYROFOAM CLAM SHELL

634
00:33:15,893 --> 00:33:19,029
         AND PRESENT IT
    LIKE AN ENGAGEMENT RING?

635
00:33:19,097 --> 00:33:21,064
             I DO."

636
00:33:29,774 --> 00:33:32,342
      TOO BAD ALL THE FOOD
     AT FAST FOOD PLACES IS
         SO BAD FOR YOU.

637
00:33:32,410 --> 00:33:36,046
  I LOVE HOW THERE'S THE OPTION
         OF A MILKSHAKE.

638
00:33:36,114 --> 00:33:38,949
          "I SHOULDN'T,
    BUT I'M IN A HURRY,
 SO I'LL GET A BURGER AND FRIES

639
00:33:39,017 --> 00:33:40,384
          AND TO DRINK,

640
00:33:40,451 --> 00:33:43,720
     I'LL HAVE THE LARGE CUP
      OF MELTED ICE CREAM.

641
00:33:43,788 --> 00:33:47,424
  DO YOU HAVE AN E.K.G. MACHINE
          BACK THERE?"

642
00:33:47,492 --> 00:33:50,060
        MOST RESTAURANTS
    TRY AND SET A MOOD.

643
00:33:50,128 --> 00:33:51,628
        YOU GO IN THERE,
          YOU'RE LIKE,

644
00:33:51,696 --> 00:33:54,931
        "I FEEL LIKE I'M
    IN A TUSCAN VILLA."

645
00:33:54,999 --> 00:33:58,368
        FAST FOOD PLACES
        ARE BRIGHTLY LIT,
    SMELL LIKE DISINFECTANT.

646
00:33:58,436 --> 00:33:59,936
         THE FURNITURE'S
          BOLTED DOWN.

647
00:34:00,004 --> 00:34:02,906
          "WHERE AM I,
      A MENTAL INSTITUTION?

648
00:34:02,974 --> 00:34:05,342
        WE GOTTA GET OUT
            OF HERE!"

649
00:34:14,519 --> 00:34:16,486
      I LOVE THE FAST FOOD.

650
00:34:16,554 --> 00:34:18,388
      I DO WISH I WAS THERE
        WHEN THEY DECIDED

651
00:34:18,456 --> 00:34:20,490
        ON THE SIZE
    OF THOSE KETCHUP PACKETS.

652
00:34:20,558 --> 00:34:22,492
         I'M NOT SAYING
        I NEED A GALLON,

653
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:26,163
        BUT MAYBE ENOUGH
     FOR MORE THAN ONE FRY.

654
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:29,166
  I ALWAYS END UP OPENING 20.
  I LOOK LIKE A HEROIN ADDICT.

655
00:34:29,233 --> 00:34:32,769
        "I'M GONNA PARTY
    ONCE I GET SET UP HERE!"

656
00:34:34,539 --> 00:34:37,908
      HAS ANYONE EVER USED
    JUST ONE KETCHUP PACKET?

657
00:34:37,975 --> 00:34:40,877
    "DO YOU HAVE A HALF
    OF A QUARTER OF AN OUNCE
        OF KETCHUP?

658
00:34:40,945 --> 00:34:43,680
     IT'S JUST SO DARN RICH.

659
00:34:43,748 --> 00:34:46,716
             I NEED
      A RESEALABLE PACKET,

660
00:34:46,784 --> 00:34:49,719
     ONE THAT I COULD STORE
          IN MY PURSE."

661
00:34:49,787 --> 00:34:51,688
      THEY ALWAYS GIVE YOU
         THREE PACKETS.

662
00:34:51,756 --> 00:34:53,390
    WHEN YOU GO BACK UP
        AND ASK FOR MORE,

663
00:34:53,458 --> 00:34:55,592
    THE GUY HANDING THEM OUT
        ALWAYS TREATS YOU

664
00:34:55,660 --> 00:34:58,361
    LIKE YOU'RE TAKING
    FROM HIS PERSONAL STASH.

665
00:34:58,429 --> 00:35:02,065
    "LOOKS LIKE MY KIDS
 AREN'T HAVING KETCHUP TONIGHT.

666
00:35:02,133 --> 00:35:04,367
    ENJOY, KETCHUP GLUTTON."

667
00:35:07,672 --> 00:35:11,007
        SOMETIMES PRINTED
      ON THE KETCHUP PACKET
  IT WILL SAY "NOT FOR RESALE."

668
00:35:12,443 --> 00:35:14,945
    I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW
    THAT WAS AN ISSUE.

669
00:35:15,012 --> 00:35:18,215
      I'VE BEEN TO A LOT
      OF FLEA MARKETS--
      NO KETCHUP PACKETS.

670
00:35:18,282 --> 00:35:21,651
    YOU KNOW WHAT?  IF YOU'RE
  IN A POSITION WHERE YOU HAVE
    TO SELL KETCHUP PACKETS,

671
00:35:21,719 --> 00:35:24,054
          I DON'T THINK
THAT'S GONNA HOLD YOU BACK.

672
00:35:24,122 --> 00:35:26,890
         "WE NEED MONEY.
      MAYBE WE SHOULD SELL
      THESE KETCHUP PACK--

673
00:35:26,958 --> 00:35:29,826
          OH, WE CAN'T.
    IT SAYS 'NOT FOR RESALE.'

674
00:35:29,894 --> 00:35:33,063
            DANG IT!"

675
00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:35,499
        IF YOU'RE LUCKY,
YOU'LL GET A KETCHUP PACKET

676
00:35:35,566 --> 00:35:38,068
         THAT'S LABELED
        AS FANCY KETCHUP.

677
00:35:38,136 --> 00:35:42,105
            KETCHUP,
      YOU'RE BEING MODEST.

678
00:35:42,173 --> 00:35:44,141
         YOU'RE WAY MORE
        THAN FANCY.

679
00:35:44,208 --> 00:35:45,809
         YOU'RE ELEGANT.

680
00:35:45,877 --> 00:35:48,612
    I KNOW IT'S ALL RELATIVE,

681
00:35:48,679 --> 00:35:52,382
      BUT WHAT KIND OF LIFE
    ARE YOU LEADING WHERE YOU
     CONSIDER KETCHUP FANCY?

682
00:35:52,450 --> 00:35:55,819
"WELL, WE AIN'T RICH FOLK,
    BUT ON SPECIAL OCCASIONS,

683
00:35:55,887 --> 00:35:58,321
         I'LL BREAK OUT
          THE KETCHUP.

684
00:35:58,389 --> 00:35:59,789
    GRANDMA'S BIRTHDAY,

685
00:35:59,857 --> 00:36:02,659
          MAKE HER FEEL
    LIKE A CELEBRITY."

686
00:36:02,727 --> 00:36:04,661
          ( falsetto )
            KETCHUP.

687
00:36:04,729 --> 00:36:07,497
     SOME FAST FOOD PLACES,
  THEY HAVE THAT KETCHUP PUMP.

688
00:36:07,565 --> 00:36:10,534
        IT'S LIKE A KEG.

689
00:36:10,601 --> 00:36:13,670
          THEY GIVE YOU
      THE PAPER SHOT GLASS.

690
00:36:13,738 --> 00:36:17,474
          I ALWAYS LIKE
      TO HANG AROUND THERE,
    TRY AND MEET THE LADIES.

691
00:36:17,542 --> 00:36:19,309
             "HERE,
    I'LL PUMP FOR YOU.

692
00:36:21,879 --> 00:36:24,581
        YOU COME TO THIS
         WENDY'S OFTEN?

693
00:36:24,649 --> 00:36:27,984
    MY ROOMMATE AND I,
     WE GOT A PONY PUMP BACK
        AT MY DORM.

694
00:36:28,052 --> 00:36:31,188
      HERE'S AN EXTRA SHOT
     FOR YOUR CUTE FRIEND."

695
00:36:31,255 --> 00:36:33,723
         HOW MANY SHOTS
     OF KETCHUP DO YOU GET?

696
00:36:33,791 --> 00:36:37,027
I USUALLY GET, LIKE, THREE,
BUT IF I'VE HAD A BAD DAY,
         I'LL GET FIVE.

697
00:36:38,963 --> 00:36:41,665
    MY WIFE THINKS I'M TRASH
  'CAUSE I USE A LOT OF KETCHUP

698
00:36:41,732 --> 00:36:44,968
          ON MY SUSHI.

699
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:46,970
    I FIND IT GETS RID
    OF THE FISH FLAVOR.

700
00:36:47,038 --> 00:36:50,140
     HOW ABOUT THOSE PEOPLE
     THAT DON'T USE KETCHUP?

701
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:52,742
WHAT ARE THEY CALLED AGAIN?
         AL QAEDA?  UGH!

702
00:36:55,012 --> 00:36:56,947
          ( falsetto )
            KETCHUP.

703
00:36:57,014 --> 00:36:59,449
     THE UPSIDE-DOWN BOTTLE
      OF KETCHUP, HAVE YOU
        SEEN THAT?

704
00:36:59,517 --> 00:37:01,484
         DON'T YOU THINK
IT'S A LITTLE EMBARRASSING

705
00:37:01,552 --> 00:37:04,321
        HOW LONG IT TOOK
    US TO COME UP WITH
     THE UPSIDE-DOWN BOTTLE?

706
00:37:04,388 --> 00:37:06,556
          IT WAS ONLY,
      LIKE, SIX MONTHS AGO.

707
00:37:06,624 --> 00:37:10,160
    SOME GUY WAS LIKE,
          "YOU KNOW...

708
00:37:10,228 --> 00:37:13,296
    WE ONLY USE IT LIKE THIS.

709
00:37:13,364 --> 00:37:16,333
      WHY DON'T WE JUST PUT
     THE CAP ON THE BOTTOM?"

710
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,835
          "HAVE PEOPLE
        BEEN COMPLAINING

711
00:37:18,903 --> 00:37:21,404
         KETCHUP IS HARD
TO GET OUT OF THE BOTTLE?"

712
00:37:21,472 --> 00:37:25,141
     "FOR, LIKE, 100 YEARS."

713
00:37:25,209 --> 00:37:27,944
        "I'LL TALK
    TO OUR GRAVITY EXPERTS."

714
00:37:29,647 --> 00:37:31,815
            KETCHUP.

715
00:37:31,882 --> 00:37:34,417
          ( falsetto )
         I NEVER THOUGHT
     I'D MISS A BACON JOKE.

716
00:37:37,922 --> 00:37:40,624
          SALSA IS LIKE
      THE MEXICAN KETCHUP.

717
00:37:40,691 --> 00:37:42,826
        MARINARA'S
      THE ITALIAN KETCHUP,

718
00:37:42,893 --> 00:37:44,928
        AND BRITISH FOOD
          IS TERRIBLE.

719
00:37:51,669 --> 00:37:55,038
        ACTUALLY VINEGAR
     IS THE BRITISH KETCHUP.

720
00:37:55,106 --> 00:37:56,640
      HOW BAD IS YOUR FOOD

721
00:37:56,707 --> 00:37:59,909
    WHEN ADDING VINEGAR
          IMPROVES IT?

722
00:37:59,977 --> 00:38:03,813
          YOU KNOW WHAT
    I USE VINEGAR FOR?
    CLEANING WINDOWS.

723
00:38:03,881 --> 00:38:06,950
          ( falsetto )
        THE BRITISH ARE
        OUR ONLY ALLIES.

724
00:38:08,686 --> 00:38:11,688
         WHY WOULD HE BE
        SO RECKLESS

725
00:38:11,756 --> 00:38:14,791
         WITH HIS EDGY
         KETCHUP JOKES?

726
00:38:24,068 --> 00:38:26,970
          YOU GUYS LOVE
    THE HOT SAUCE DOWN HERE,
        DON'T YOU?

727
00:38:27,038 --> 00:38:31,007
          ( cheering )

728
00:38:31,075 --> 00:38:34,511
     YOU EVER NOTICE PEOPLE
 THAT ARE REALLY INTO HOT SAUCE
ARE ALWAYS CHALLENGING YOU?

729
00:38:34,578 --> 00:38:37,614
         "HEY, WHY DON'T
      YOU GET THE SUPER HOT
    FIRE-ENGINE SAUCE?"

730
00:38:37,682 --> 00:38:40,917
    "'CAUSE I DON'T FEEL LIKE
    THE SUPER HOT FIRE-ENGINE
            DIARRHEA.

731
00:38:42,486 --> 00:38:44,521
         HOW ABOUT THAT
    FOR A REASON, HUH?

732
00:38:44,588 --> 00:38:46,589
          I'M NOT INTO
     WEARING DIAPERS, OKAY?"

733
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:52,162
      SPEAKING OF DIAPERS,
     I WENT TO WAFFLE HOUSE
        LAST NIGHT.

734
00:38:55,032 --> 00:38:57,300
         I'LL TELL YOU,
    I THOUGHT THE IHOP
        WAS A DUMP

735
00:38:57,368 --> 00:38:59,169
          UNTIL I WENT
      INTO A WAFFLE HOUSE.

736
00:38:59,236 --> 00:39:02,172
     THEY'RE NOT EVEN TRYING
            IN THERE.

737
00:39:03,974 --> 00:39:06,343
     HERE'S SOMETHING YOU'LL
  NEVER HEAR IN A WAFFLE HOUSE:

738
00:39:06,410 --> 00:39:09,379
     "NICE JOB CLEANING UP!"

739
00:39:09,447 --> 00:39:11,414
    NOW IF YOU'VE NEVER BEEN
    TO A WAFFLE HOUSE,

740
00:39:11,482 --> 00:39:13,783
          JUST IMAGINE
     A GAS-STATION BATHROOM

741
00:39:13,851 --> 00:39:16,586
    THAT SELLS WAFFLES,

742
00:39:16,654 --> 00:39:19,522
         AND YOU'VE BEEN
    TO A WAFFLE HOUSE.

743
00:39:23,294 --> 00:39:25,995
      I LOVE WAFFLE HOUSE.

744
00:39:26,063 --> 00:39:28,598
    AND NOT JUST 'CAUSE
WATCHING SOMEONE FRY AN EGG

745
00:39:28,666 --> 00:39:32,168
      WHILE THEY'RE SMOKING
      REMINDS ME OF MY DAD.

746
00:39:32,236 --> 00:39:36,039
    IT'S THE PEOPLE IN THERE.
     IT'S LIKE A WHITE-TRASH
        CONVENTION,

747
00:39:36,107 --> 00:39:38,575
            OR FOR ME
        A FAMILY REUNION.

748
00:39:38,642 --> 00:39:40,577
    IT'S SO WHITE TRASH
            IN THERE,

749
00:39:40,644 --> 00:39:43,380
        IT MAKES THE IHOP
      APPEAR INTERNATIONAL.

750
00:39:46,384 --> 00:39:48,318
         I'VE SEEN A GUN
     FIVE TIMES IN MY LIFE.

751
00:39:48,386 --> 00:39:51,888
     THREE OF THEM HAVE BEEN
        IN WAFFLE HOUSE.

752
00:39:51,956 --> 00:39:54,824
    THERE'S DEFINITELY
    A DANGEROUS FEEL TO 'EM.

753
00:39:54,892 --> 00:39:58,328
EVEN THE WAFFLE HOUSE SIGN
LOOKS LIKE A RANSOM NOTE.

754
00:39:58,396 --> 00:40:01,231
  THERE'S ALWAYS A LETTER OUT.
 OCCASIONALLY IT'LL BE THE "W,"

755
00:40:01,298 --> 00:40:04,300
         SO IT'LL READ
         "AFFLE HOUSE."

756
00:40:04,368 --> 00:40:07,203
    "THAT'S WHERE I WANNA GO
          AT 2:00 A.M."

757
00:40:07,271 --> 00:40:09,305
THAT'S WHEN EVERYONE GOES.

758
00:40:09,373 --> 00:40:11,508
     THEIR SLOGAN SHOULD BE,
        "IT'S 2:00 A.M.,

759
00:40:11,575 --> 00:40:13,710
    STILL TIME TO MAKE
     ONE MORE BAD DECISION."

760
00:40:17,047 --> 00:40:18,782
        YOU GO IN THERE,

761
00:40:18,849 --> 00:40:20,950
        EVERYONE'S DRUNK.

762
00:40:21,018 --> 00:40:23,186
    YOU KNOW EVERYONE'S DRUNK
         IN WAFFLE HOUSE

763
00:40:23,254 --> 00:40:26,356
    'CAUSE THEY HAVE PICTURES
    OF THE FOOD ON THE MENU.

764
00:40:26,424 --> 00:40:28,691
        HOW DRUNK DO YOU
HAVE TO BE TO NOT REMEMBER

765
00:40:28,759 --> 00:40:30,760
          WHAT A WAFFLE
        LOOKS LIKE?

766
00:40:30,828 --> 00:40:33,096
        "OH, YEAH,
IT'S LIKE A PLAID PANCAKE."

767
00:40:34,865 --> 00:40:36,866
     "I'LL HAVE 12 OF THOSE
         FOR A NICKEL."

768
00:40:38,502 --> 00:40:41,271
        YOU EVER GO INTO
  WAFFLE HOUSE DURING THE DAY?

769
00:40:41,338 --> 00:40:42,705
          THAT'S WEIRD.

770
00:40:42,773 --> 00:40:46,342
        "THIS PLACE
         LOOKS FAMILIAR.

771
00:40:46,410 --> 00:40:49,412
    I THINK I THREW UP
            IN HERE.

772
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:51,114
        OH, THERE IT IS."

773
00:40:53,617 --> 00:40:56,586
     ALL RIGHT, THAT IS ALL.
  THANK YOU SO MUCH, YOU GUYS.
