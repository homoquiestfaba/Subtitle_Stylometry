1
00:00:01,441 --> 00:00:03,807
- Sorry about being a, you know.

2
00:00:03,807 --> 00:00:05,607
- It's okay, I deserve it.

3
00:00:05,607 --> 00:00:06,941
I am a loser.

4
00:00:06,941 --> 00:00:09,441
Boo!

5
00:00:09,441 --> 00:00:10,374
- You're just--

6
00:00:10,374 --> 00:00:11,574
- A square?

7
00:00:11,574 --> 00:00:12,607
- You're with this square?

8
00:00:13,541 --> 00:00:15,641
- Yeah, but I went out with you!

9
00:00:15,641 --> 00:00:17,241
Johnny Keen.

10
00:00:23,574 --> 00:00:24,507
- They're coming!

11
00:00:24,507 --> 00:00:25,874
- Who, where, what...

12
00:00:25,874 --> 00:00:27,241
The Martians! - Just calm down!

13
00:00:27,241 --> 00:00:29,041
Martians everywhere man!

14
00:00:31,007 --> 00:00:33,841
- Whoa man, what are they smoking?

15
00:00:37,041 --> 00:00:37,874
- No way!

16
00:00:39,107 --> 00:00:42,174
Smells like shit, this tastes legit!

17
00:00:42,174 --> 00:00:44,441
They turned my friends into zombies!

18
00:00:44,441 --> 00:00:46,674
- Have you been smoking the marijuana?

19
00:00:46,674 --> 00:00:47,641
- See!

20
00:00:47,641 --> 00:00:49,741
Marijuana makes people crazy!

21
00:00:49,741 --> 00:00:51,307
They whack people with hatchets!

22
00:00:51,307 --> 00:00:53,374
- Government propaganda man!

23
00:00:53,374 --> 00:00:55,874
- I think that's a house!

24
00:00:55,874 --> 00:00:56,707
- Ya! - What do you

25
00:00:56,707 --> 00:00:57,974
hooligans doing here?

26
00:00:57,974 --> 00:01:00,074
- There's an army of zombie beatniks...

27
00:01:00,074 --> 00:01:02,707
- Did you say zombies?

28
00:01:06,074 --> 00:01:07,107
Head for the tool shed

29
00:01:07,107 --> 00:01:08,441
in back!

30
00:01:08,441 --> 00:01:10,107
Go, dammit!

31
00:01:10,107 --> 00:01:13,807
Stop those Martians from coming in!

32
00:01:15,741 --> 00:01:16,807
- Let's rock!

00:01:19,274 --> 00:01:21,874

Hold it right--

00:04:28,007 --> 00:04:29,374

43
00:04:29,374 --> 00:04:30,541
Don't move!

00:04:30,541 --> 00:04:31,541
You're beatnik zombies, aren't ya?

45
00:04:31,541 --> 00:04:32,874
I'm no beatnik zombie!

46
00:04:34,074 --> 00:04:35,007
Put that contraption down!

47
00:04:35,007 --> 00:04:36,507
What, the camera?

48
00:04:36,507 --> 00:04:37,174
Put it down! - You're not gonna

49
00:04:37,174 --> 00:04:38,107
shoot us are ya?

50
00:04:38,107 --> 00:04:38,974
Why shouldn't I?

51
00:04:38,974 --> 00:04:40,041
We're lost!

52
00:04:40,041 --> 00:04:41,274
Lost?

53
00:04:41,274 --> 00:04:43,574
Yeah yeah, we just want to go home!

54
00:04:47,207 --> 00:04:48,774
I was lost once.

55
00:04:48,774 --> 00:04:51,174
Now for a long time.

56
00:04:52,574 --> 00:04:55,141
I guess we could find you a way home.

57
00:04:55,141 --> 00:04:56,774
Uh, come on in then!

58
00:04:56,774 --> 00:04:58,074
Come on!

59
00:04:58,074 --> 00:04:59,041
Okay.

60
00:05:03,941 --> 00:05:04,774
Go inside!

61
00:05:06,174 --> 00:05:09,107
Wow, check this place out.

62
00:05:09,107 --> 00:05:12,507
Well make yourself to home.

63
00:05:13,641 --> 00:05:15,341
Cool.

64
00:05:15,341 --> 00:05:16,907
Sit!

65
00:05:20,607 --> 00:05:22,207
Just, just.

66
00:05:24,474 --> 00:05:25,741
Uh, here.

67
00:05:25,741 --> 00:05:26,874
What's that?

68
00:05:26,874 --> 00:05:28,107
- Peace offering.

69
00:05:28,107 --> 00:05:29,974
You know, like, like a candy bar.

70
00:05:29,974 --> 00:05:31,707
You do know what a candy bar is, right?

71
00:05:31,707 --> 00:05:33,674
Should have brought steak flavor.

72
00:05:34,574 --> 00:05:35,407
- Oh!

73
00:05:37,874 --> 00:05:38,974
Eww.

74
00:05:38,974 --> 00:05:40,674
What else you got?

75
00:05:40,674 --> 00:05:42,941
Uh, I got some, uh, water.

76
00:05:42,941 --> 00:05:46,041
- What kind'a glass is that?

77
00:05:46,041 --> 00:05:48,274
Um, it's plastic.

78
00:05:48,274 --> 00:05:51,074
Kind of like glass, except unbreakable.

79
00:05:51,074 --> 00:05:52,741
- Like bakelite.

80
00:05:52,741 --> 00:05:53,574
- Plastic.

81
00:05:53,574 --> 00:05:54,407
- What year is this?

82
00:05:54,407 --> 00:05:55,541
Uh, 2005.

83
00:05:55,541 --> 00:05:57,374
- Jumpin' jalopies!

84
00:05:57,374 --> 00:06:00,207
What year did you think it was?

85
00:06:00,207 --> 00:06:04,374
- I don't know, hell I thought it was, 1900 and 67?

86
00:06:05,574 --> 00:06:08,474
- So sir, um, why are you out here?

87
00:06:08,474 --> 00:06:12,407
Uh, why, why did you stay out here in the wild?

88
00:06:14,407 --> 00:06:15,574
- Martian zombies.

89
00:06:15,574 --> 00:06:17,541
Shut up bitch,

90
00:06:17,541 --> 00:06:19,974
and just give me the camera.

91
00:06:19,974 --> 00:06:22,174
Please sir, about the zombies?

92
00:06:22,174 --> 00:06:24,574
- I don't even know if it really even happened now.

93
00:06:24,574 --> 00:06:25,841
Maybe because it didn't?

94
00:06:25,841 --> 00:06:29,241
- Guess it was, like a dream, and also

95
00:06:29,241 --> 00:06:30,207
it faded away, and... - If you

96
00:06:30,207 --> 00:06:31,374
don't shut up I'll kill you,

97
00:06:31,374 --> 00:06:32,641
this is the greatest thing that...

98
00:06:32,641 --> 00:06:34,441
- All I wanted to do is stay alive.

99
00:06:34,441 --> 00:06:35,974
Excuse me, Indie.

100
00:06:35,974 --> 00:06:37,474
Trevor go outside.

101
00:06:37,474 --> 00:06:39,641
- I did stay alive I don't know why I stayed alive.

102
00:06:39,641 --> 00:06:40,874
About the Martian zombies?

103
00:06:40,874 --> 00:06:42,241
- I got to stay alive I guess it's so I--

104
00:06:42,241 --> 00:06:44,141
Please sir, about the zombies?

105
00:06:44,141 --> 00:06:45,807
- Yeah I remember!

106
00:06:45,807 --> 00:06:47,374
I remember!

107
00:06:47,374 --> 00:06:49,474
Frankie and I, we, ran all around

108
00:06:49,474 --> 00:06:52,207
in his Skyline convertible.

109
00:06:52,207 --> 00:06:54,141
Every girl wanted to ride in that convertible.

110
00:06:54,141 --> 00:06:57,007
That Skyline was red and white, and...

111
00:06:57,007 --> 00:06:59,207
Except Susie, she didn't like Frankie.

112
00:06:59,207 --> 00:07:02,807
But, he didn't care, he knew he was gonna date her.

113
00:07:02,807 --> 00:07:06,307
One day, Frankie and I go into Pop's Soda Shop,

114
00:07:06,307 --> 00:07:10,107
and there's Susie in there, Peggy Sue sitting at a booth.

115
00:07:10,107 --> 00:07:11,441
We saunter up.

116
00:07:11,441 --> 00:07:13,974
They're looking pretty as can be.

117
00:07:15,507 --> 00:07:17,141
Quit daydreaming Rocky,

118
00:07:17,141 --> 00:07:17,974
let's go!

119
00:07:22,841 --> 00:07:24,207
Is this Johnny boy's car?

120
00:07:24,207 --> 00:07:26,274
Yeah, Johnny boy.

121
00:07:26,274 --> 00:07:27,207
- Let's go say hi to him.

122
00:08:06,241 --> 00:08:09,241
- I can't believe you're doing this!

123
00:08:15,674 --> 00:08:16,941
- He's kind of cute.

124
00:08:16,941 --> 00:08:18,341
Do you?

125
00:08:18,341 --> 00:08:19,941
A total square.

126
00:08:19,941 --> 00:08:21,907
- A bet is a bet.

127
00:08:21,907 --> 00:08:26,074
Even.

128
00:08:40,274 --> 00:08:41,274
- Hey Susie!

129
00:08:42,707 --> 00:08:44,874
- Hey Frankie, Rocky.

130
00:08:44,874 --> 00:08:46,441
Who you waiting for?

131
00:08:46,441 --> 00:08:48,774
- Oh, wouldn't you like to know?

132
00:08:48,774 --> 00:08:51,841
- A pretty thing like you shouldn't be kept waiting.

133
00:08:51,841 --> 00:08:53,341
- Don't you start!

134
00:08:57,607 --> 00:08:59,341
- How about coming to the Grange with me tonight?

135
00:08:59,341 --> 00:09:01,841
There's a rockabilly show.

136
00:09:01,841 --> 00:09:04,507
- Look, even if I could leave,

137
00:09:04,507 --> 00:09:06,074
I wouldn't leave with you.

138
00:09:06,074 --> 00:09:07,207
What, you too good for me?

139
00:09:07,207 --> 00:09:08,474
- Go away!

140
00:09:08,474 --> 00:09:10,674
I hear Betty's looking for you.

141
00:09:10,674 --> 00:09:12,874
- Come on, you know you want some sugar daddy!

142
00:09:12,874 --> 00:09:13,707
- Go away!

143
00:09:17,507 --> 00:09:18,341
- What?

144
00:09:21,007 --> 00:09:23,807
I didn't order two shakes.

145
00:09:23,807 --> 00:09:25,974
You guys order two shakes?

146
00:09:28,174 --> 00:09:29,241
You're with this square?

147
00:09:29,241 --> 00:09:30,274
Hey you guys. - Oooo,

148
00:09:30,274 --> 00:09:31,674
Johnny and Susie.

149
00:09:32,807 --> 00:09:36,407
Nothing's happening, we're just...

150
00:09:40,274 --> 00:09:41,474
- I think those are for me!

151
00:09:41,474 --> 00:09:43,041
- No, these aren't,

152
00:09:43,907 --> 00:09:46,041
the, these are for Susie and me.

153
00:09:46,041 --> 00:09:47,874
- Don't you like me?

154
00:09:47,874 --> 00:09:49,474
I thought you liked me, Johnny?

155
00:09:49,474 --> 00:09:50,607
Well gee, I--

156
00:09:50,607 --> 00:09:51,974
You don't?

157
00:09:51,974 --> 00:09:53,541
- I like you.

158
00:09:53,541 --> 00:09:54,441
Yeah, I do.

159
00:09:56,941 --> 00:09:58,374
Really, its...

160
00:09:58,374 --> 00:09:59,474
It's just that--

161
00:09:59,474 --> 00:10:01,307
- I'll give it to her.

162
00:10:08,241 --> 00:10:09,641
Ooop!

163
00:10:11,007 --> 00:10:13,941
Johnny Keen, now look what you did.

164
00:10:14,974 --> 00:10:15,807
- No!

165
00:10:16,774 --> 00:10:18,607
It's, it's just that my--

166
00:10:18,607 --> 00:10:19,907
- Yeah?

167
00:10:19,907 --> 00:10:21,474
You're mommy gonna kill you?

168
00:10:22,674 --> 00:10:24,307
Poor Johnny baby.

169
00:10:24,307 --> 00:10:25,141
- No!

170
00:10:28,007 --> 00:10:28,841
Fine.

171
00:10:41,241 --> 00:10:44,107
- You kill my Johnny, but that's why I like you.

172
00:10:44,107 --> 00:10:46,307
Just not enough to kick your butt.

173
00:10:46,307 --> 00:10:47,141
- Go away!

174
00:10:48,574 --> 00:10:51,041
I mean, leave please?

175
00:10:51,041 --> 00:10:52,641
- Why don't you go ahead and make me?

176
00:10:52,641 --> 00:10:54,874
Come on tough guy, I'll give you one shot for free.

177
00:10:54,874 --> 00:10:56,807
Go ahead, come on, weeny!

178
00:10:56,807 --> 00:10:59,441
What are you waiting for?

179
00:11:11,874 --> 00:11:13,041
Boo!

180
00:11:16,541 --> 00:11:18,641
- Stop it, just stop it!

181
00:11:18,641 --> 00:11:20,107
- Little Susie doesn't want us making fun

182
00:11:20,107 --> 00:11:21,174
of her Johnny baby!

183
00:11:21,174 --> 00:11:22,407
Johnny baby!

184
00:11:22,407 --> 00:11:23,207
We better get out of here

185
00:11:23,207 --> 00:11:24,774
before we get hurt!

186
00:11:24,774 --> 00:11:26,441
Bye bye Johnny baby!

187
00:11:27,907 --> 00:11:31,941
And Susie, give me a call when you want a real man.

188
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:34,774
Johnny baby, ha ha ha...

189
00:11:35,907 --> 00:11:38,607
- I'll let you know when I see one!

190
00:11:48,174 --> 00:11:50,107
Can we get out of here?

191
00:12:40,907 --> 00:12:43,741
Even your car is a loser!

192
00:12:43,741 --> 00:12:45,407
Ug!

193
00:12:45,407 --> 00:12:48,041
Someone please wake me up from this nightmare!

194
00:12:49,307 --> 00:12:50,141
- Sorry!

195
00:12:51,507 --> 00:12:55,007
Dad warned me about the voltage regulator.

196
00:12:55,874 --> 00:12:56,907
- Like I care!

197
00:12:59,707 --> 00:13:02,174
Push this heap of junk out of here now!

198
00:14:10,841 --> 00:14:13,274
- Rufus and the guys better get here soon.

199
00:14:14,274 --> 00:14:16,874
Yeah, so...

200
00:14:42,674 --> 00:14:44,607
- Do you have to do that?

201
00:14:44,607 --> 00:14:48,474
- Sorry, so I'm nervous, I would sing it but,

202
00:14:48,474 --> 00:14:50,474
I thought it might bother you.

203
00:14:50,474 --> 00:14:53,307
It's just a silly song my grandpa sang.

204
00:14:53,307 --> 00:14:55,541
I don't know why I sing it.

205
00:14:56,674 --> 00:15:00,241
It's really stupid, it's stuck in my brain.

206
00:15:00,241 --> 00:15:03,541
It's weird, I feel better after I sing it.

207
00:15:03,541 --> 00:15:06,107
♪ BS makes the grass grow green

208
00:15:06,107 --> 00:15:08,641
♪ The cow, he eats the grass

209
00:15:08,641 --> 00:15:11,107
♪ The farmer, he milks the cow

210
00:15:11,107 --> 00:15:15,407
♪ And we drink the BS from the glaaaaass.

211
00:15:26,774 --> 00:15:29,607
- Sorry about being a, you know...

212
00:15:30,774 --> 00:15:31,774
- It's okay.

213
00:15:33,341 --> 00:15:34,741
I deserve it.

214
00:15:34,741 --> 00:15:35,807
I am a loser.

215
00:15:37,374 --> 00:15:39,107
- You're just...

216
00:15:39,107 --> 00:15:40,974
Different?

217
00:15:40,974 --> 00:15:41,874
- Yeah.

218
00:15:41,874 --> 00:15:42,807
- A square?

219
00:15:50,674 --> 00:15:52,741
- Well Einstein is different.

220
00:15:52,741 --> 00:15:54,541
And he's not a square.

221
00:15:54,541 --> 00:15:57,074
- Yeah, Einstein's not cool.

222
00:15:57,074 --> 00:15:58,541
- Yeah he is!

223
00:15:58,541 --> 00:16:01,007
- Right, you'd go out with him?

224
00:16:01,007 --> 00:16:01,841
- No!

225
00:16:04,874 --> 00:16:07,974
But I went out with you, Johnny Keen.

226
00:16:12,307 --> 00:16:15,707
So um,

227
00:16:15,707 --> 00:16:17,574
you want to go up to Lover's Peak?

228
00:16:17,574 --> 00:16:20,307
Uh, I mean it's what all the cool kids

229
00:16:20,307 --> 00:16:23,374
are doing on a Saturday night, right?

230
00:16:26,307 --> 00:16:27,141
- Sure!

231
00:16:30,074 --> 00:16:31,007
We're cool!

232
00:16:32,707 --> 00:16:34,274
- The coolest. - Yeah!

233
00:16:43,407 --> 00:16:47,541
You, me, verse...

234
00:16:47,541 --> 00:16:49,441
Coal, black, asphaltic,

235
00:16:52,141 --> 00:16:54,941
steamy enslavement of the void,

236
00:16:54,941 --> 00:16:57,174
empty, E equals MC squared.

237
00:16:59,041 --> 00:17:01,541
Square root, root canal, pain,

238
00:17:02,607 --> 00:17:05,774
of the impossible journey to see

239
00:17:05,774 --> 00:17:09,540
translucent Martian brothers, pie in the sky,

240
00:17:10,674 --> 00:17:13,074
rhubarb Mars, crimson with ire,

241
00:17:13,074 --> 00:17:16,841
I tire of the time, space, conundrum, ho-hum.

242
00:17:19,941 --> 00:17:23,274
Infeasible tract, restore primitive man,

243
00:17:25,174 --> 00:17:28,841
ape, neanderthal, ignorant, low-brow, biped,

244
00:17:30,407 --> 00:17:33,574
oblique, ori-eyed vibrations, discord,

245
00:17:34,774 --> 00:17:38,507
dispeace, disharmony, disunity, dissension,

246
00:17:38,507 --> 00:17:41,774
dissidence, dis-service to serve to me,

247
00:17:42,874 --> 00:17:44,541
to serve tea, to me?

248
00:17:46,441 --> 00:17:49,941
Misunderstood we, cerebral fiber, chaotic,

249
00:17:52,841 --> 00:17:56,674
door to enlightenment, key stoned, of my soul.

250
00:18:00,507 --> 00:18:02,374
Yeah dig it!

251
00:18:02,374 --> 00:18:03,674
Jive it my brother.

252
00:18:03,674 --> 00:18:04,607
- Dig it.

253
00:18:04,607 --> 00:18:06,707
- My man Maynard, are you next?

254
00:18:09,674 --> 00:18:12,107
- Well, I-- - Why you standin'?

255
00:18:13,741 --> 00:18:15,174
You were gonna walk the weasel!

256
00:18:15,174 --> 00:18:16,774
- Lumber the louse, ramble the rascal!

257
00:18:16,774 --> 00:18:17,974
- Sweat the snake?

258
00:18:17,974 --> 00:18:20,441
- Amber reptile, slither earth-bound.

259
00:18:20,441 --> 00:18:22,507
- Bits of pepperoni strangle the Stradivarius.

260
00:18:22,507 --> 00:18:24,107
- Squeeze spicy sausage classical--

261
00:18:24,107 --> 00:18:25,941
- And hit him, with a Maynard.

262
00:18:25,941 --> 00:18:27,741
- Main miniscule Maynard man.

263
00:18:27,741 --> 00:18:29,841
- You need help finding little Maynard man?

264
00:18:29,841 --> 00:18:31,374
Isn't that why Edna left you,

265
00:18:31,374 --> 00:18:32,741
she couldn't find little Maynard?

266
00:18:33,741 --> 00:18:34,574
- Ooooo...

267
00:18:35,874 --> 00:18:36,707
- Ooo!

268
00:18:36,707 --> 00:18:38,207
- Burn on Maynard.

269
00:18:39,474 --> 00:18:40,807
- Don't get lost!

270
00:18:40,807 --> 00:18:42,207
- Oom-pah-pah! - And don't piss yourself!

271
00:20:03,841 --> 00:20:07,407
- Well, arithmetic makes me feel so stupid.

272
00:20:09,307 --> 00:20:10,374
I guess I am.

273
00:20:11,541 --> 00:20:14,141
I don't know, I just don't get it.

274
00:20:14,141 --> 00:20:15,207
- You're not.

275
00:20:16,307 --> 00:20:18,941
I know you're probably real smart.

276
00:20:20,041 --> 00:20:21,607
- I barely get C's.

277
00:20:22,707 --> 00:20:24,841
- Grades don't mean anything.

278
00:20:24,841 --> 00:20:26,907
You don't necessarily have to be smart to get A's,

279
00:20:26,907 --> 00:20:29,074
just good at taking tests.

280
00:20:30,007 --> 00:20:31,507
- Really?

281
00:20:31,507 --> 00:20:32,341
- Sure.

282
00:20:34,107 --> 00:20:35,341
Like math.

283
00:20:35,341 --> 00:20:36,574
- Uh hmm.

284
00:20:36,574 --> 00:20:38,074
- It's one of those subjects

285
00:20:38,074 --> 00:20:41,341
that you have to see from just the right angle.

286
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:44,041
You take the Grand Canyon.

287
00:20:44,041 --> 00:20:47,374
If you were driving by, you wouldn't even know it was there.

288
00:20:47,374 --> 00:20:49,274
Or in a plane at 30,000 feet.

289
00:20:49,274 --> 00:20:52,441
But, if you were to stand at the edge,

290
00:20:55,074 --> 00:20:56,807
it hits you.

291
00:20:56,807 --> 00:21:00,174
It's so clear it's, simple, magnificent.

292
00:21:04,941 --> 00:21:05,774
- Really?

293
00:21:10,274 --> 00:21:12,207
You make it sound so...

294
00:21:14,374 --> 00:21:16,141
Exciting. - I do?

295
00:21:16,141 --> 00:21:16,974
- Uh hmm.

296
00:21:18,574 --> 00:21:21,507
I never thought math could be so...

297
00:21:22,741 --> 00:21:23,574
- Logical?

298
00:21:25,741 --> 00:21:26,674
- Engaging.

299
00:21:32,941 --> 00:21:33,774
- Yeah.

300
00:21:35,941 --> 00:21:40,107
Uh, I know if, if you saw it from just the right angle,

301
00:21:43,041 --> 00:21:44,774
you'd be a whiz.

302
00:21:44,774 --> 00:21:46,674
- Can you now...

303
00:21:46,674 --> 00:21:48,841
Demonstrate, these angles?

304
00:22:50,107 --> 00:22:50,941
- Whoa...

305
00:22:52,741 --> 00:22:53,574
- Whoa!

306
00:22:55,907 --> 00:22:58,207
- Whoa man, what are they smoking?

307
00:22:59,774 --> 00:23:02,174
- No man, what have we been smoking?

308
00:23:14,841 --> 00:23:17,374
We come in peace, brother man.

309
00:23:18,607 --> 00:23:20,141
You need to slow down.

310
00:23:20,141 --> 00:23:21,841
- Martians!

311
00:23:29,774 --> 00:23:31,241
Cool man.

312
00:23:31,241 --> 00:23:33,174
Do my eyes deceive?

313
00:23:33,174 --> 00:23:34,874
What's this?

314
00:23:34,874 --> 00:23:36,141
- Atomic tea man?

315
00:23:36,141 --> 00:23:37,707
Chemical cranium

316
00:23:37,707 --> 00:23:40,907
expander man.

317
00:23:40,907 --> 00:23:42,441
It's the good shit.

318
00:23:48,074 --> 00:23:50,941
- Cool man, been smoking the wicked tea?

319
00:23:53,474 --> 00:23:54,307
Damn!

320
00:24:00,341 --> 00:24:01,141
- Ugh...

321
00:24:05,041 --> 00:24:07,174
- Your dog roll this man?

322
00:24:07,174 --> 00:24:09,507
- No man, he birthed it man.

323
00:24:13,141 --> 00:24:14,674
Ooo!

324
00:24:16,607 --> 00:24:17,774
- Tea.

325
00:24:17,774 --> 00:24:20,307
- Tea, yeah I can dig it man.

326
00:24:20,307 --> 00:24:21,974
- Tea, you smoke it.

327
00:24:23,374 --> 00:24:26,041
- No way man, that's some foul shit!

328
00:24:26,041 --> 00:24:29,107
- It's good, makes you feel good!

329
00:24:29,107 --> 00:24:30,641
- You smoke it man!

330
00:24:37,907 --> 00:24:39,341
I don't think these guys are playing around.

331
00:24:39,341 --> 00:24:40,807
- Okay.

332
00:24:40,807 --> 00:24:43,341
I don't know where he's gonna put that thing.

333
00:24:43,341 --> 00:24:44,974
Sure ain't gonna smoke it.

334
00:24:44,974 --> 00:24:49,507
I think we better smoke it man.

335
00:24:49,507 --> 00:24:51,241
Spread the tea, man!

336
00:24:51,241 --> 00:24:52,941
Yeah how is it man?

337
00:24:52,941 --> 00:24:54,907
Oh man!

338
00:24:54,907 --> 00:24:57,907
Smells like shit, this tastes legit!

339
00:25:00,274 --> 00:25:02,074
You said it man!

340
00:25:12,241 --> 00:25:13,807
- Hmm.

341
00:25:17,107 --> 00:25:20,507
And then, the Martian said,

342
00:25:20,507 --> 00:25:22,341
take me to your wiener!

343
00:25:27,241 --> 00:25:31,041
Here, you got to try it Chet.

344
00:25:32,941 --> 00:25:33,774
- Women!

345
00:25:34,774 --> 00:25:35,741
Women.

346
00:25:35,741 --> 00:25:38,007
- Chicks, I can dig it man.

347
00:25:39,507 --> 00:25:40,974
- Party with chicks man...

348
00:25:42,241 --> 00:25:43,774
- Good tea man!

349
00:25:45,007 --> 00:25:47,041
- We could probably scare up a few chicks.

350
00:25:47,041 --> 00:25:49,307
- Might be scary looking though man!

351
00:26:02,507 --> 00:26:05,241
- Find us 10 Earth women.

352
00:26:05,241 --> 00:26:07,441
Bring them back to here.

353
00:26:07,441 --> 00:26:09,574
Build a cage for you.

354
00:26:09,574 --> 00:26:10,907
Bring them here.

355
00:26:12,141 --> 00:26:13,674
We need women!

356
00:26:13,674 --> 00:26:16,174
Women, women...

357
00:26:16,174 --> 00:26:18,141
Our planet is without women,

358
00:26:18,141 --> 00:26:20,041
we need their ovaries.

359
00:26:20,041 --> 00:26:23,207
Now get 10 women, bring them back.

360
00:26:23,207 --> 00:26:26,707
And when you have them, press this green button.

361
00:26:26,707 --> 00:26:28,507
This is very simple.

362
00:26:28,507 --> 00:26:31,307
Do you understand.

363
00:27:14,874 --> 00:27:17,307
Wow, I didn't know Lover's Peak

364
00:27:17,307 --> 00:27:19,341
was so far away.

365
00:27:19,341 --> 00:27:22,507
Just have a little patience.

366
00:27:23,674 --> 00:27:25,507
Okay, I am, but I got to go,

367
00:27:25,507 --> 00:27:26,341
I have a curfew, and I have to--

368
00:27:26,341 --> 00:27:27,607
Shhh!

369
00:27:28,441 --> 00:27:30,274
It's worth the wait.

370
00:27:33,041 --> 00:27:37,207
♪ My heart's broken, and you're to blame

371
00:27:40,807 --> 00:27:43,807

00:29:16,407 --> 00:29:17,507
- We have to split the scene man!

395
00:29:17,507 --> 00:29:18,741
- Who are you? - We have to tear away!

396
00:29:18,741 --> 00:29:19,574
- What are you doing in my dad's car?

397
00:29:20,941 --> 00:29:22,441
- The Martians!

398
00:29:22,441 --> 00:29:24,107
Let's calm down! - The Martians everywhere man!

399
00:29:24,107 --> 00:29:25,041
Calm down-- - Go!

400
00:29:25,041 --> 00:29:26,207
- Let's calm down and figure out

401
00:29:26,207 --> 00:29:27,441
what this is all about!

402
00:29:27,441 --> 00:29:29,307
Who's late, what, what's happening where?

403
00:29:29,307 --> 00:29:32,074
- I was in the woods, with my friends, these beatniks...

404
00:29:32,074 --> 00:29:36,274
Martians came down, in this flying saucer...

405
00:29:38,341 --> 00:29:40,874
- Hey Rufus I thought you said Jax was gonna be here?

406
00:29:40,874 --> 00:29:42,241
- He said he'd be here.

407
00:29:44,374 --> 00:29:46,874
- Hey what's that over there?

408
00:29:50,674 --> 00:29:51,574
- It's just a rat.

409
00:29:54,674 --> 00:29:56,807
- Hey look I think he's smoking a joint!

410
00:30:05,941 --> 00:30:07,541
- And then I saw your car!

411
00:30:07,541 --> 00:30:09,007
So let's split man!

412
00:30:09,007 --> 00:30:10,841
- Look at him!

413
00:30:10,841 --> 00:30:11,741
He's crazy!

414
00:30:13,407 --> 00:30:15,807
And even if he isn't, he's a beat!

415
00:30:15,807 --> 00:30:17,407
And you can't trust beats!

416
00:30:17,407 --> 00:30:18,307
- You can too!

417
00:30:18,307 --> 00:30:19,741
- Can not!

418
00:30:19,741 --> 00:30:21,907
Would you trust someone dressed like that?

419
00:30:21,907 --> 00:30:24,707
And besides, beats do the marijuana!

420
00:30:24,707 --> 00:30:25,941
- So?

421
00:30:25,941 --> 00:30:28,374
- Haven't you ever seen Refer Madness?

422
00:30:29,474 --> 00:30:32,174
Marijuana makes people crazy!

423
00:30:32,174 --> 00:30:33,574
They whack people with hatchets!

424
00:30:33,574 --> 00:30:36,207
- Government propaganda man!

425
00:30:36,207 --> 00:30:39,574
J. Edgar Hoover does tea, and he wears lady's underwear,

426
00:30:39,574 --> 00:30:42,674
and I don't see him putting hatchets in peoples' heads!

427
00:30:42,674 --> 00:30:45,674
- You know, when was the last time you saw J. Edgar Hoover?

428
00:30:45,674 --> 00:30:48,607
Was he wearing your underwear, man?

429
00:30:52,741 --> 00:30:55,407
- Have you been smoking the marijuana?

430
00:30:55,407 --> 00:30:56,974
- See?

431
00:30:56,974 --> 00:30:59,941
Listen to me, you can't trust him.

432
00:30:59,941 --> 00:31:02,174
He'll put a hatchet in your head!

433
00:31:02,174 --> 00:31:03,974
- Beat to L-seven!

434
00:31:03,974 --> 00:31:06,574
Get the penolopie, on the go!

435
00:31:07,941 --> 00:31:09,441
- Maybe we should just go back to town?

436
00:31:09,441 --> 00:31:11,574
- Now you're speaking the language of sense, man!

437
00:31:11,574 --> 00:31:12,841
Back to town!

438
00:31:12,841 --> 00:31:15,141
Back to where we need to be, free from here!

439
00:31:15,141 --> 00:31:16,241
Feminine fanati-- - We'll take you back

440
00:31:16,241 --> 00:31:17,241
as far as town.

441
00:31:17,241 --> 00:31:18,574
- The sweet sound of town man!

442
00:31:18,574 --> 00:31:20,007
Let's put some pavement between

443
00:31:20,007 --> 00:31:21,541
this place daddy-o!

444
00:31:21,541 --> 00:31:23,007
- Dang!

445
00:31:25,307 --> 00:31:26,507
- Dammit Johnny!

446
00:31:26,507 --> 00:31:28,407
You are so stupid!

447
00:31:28,407 --> 00:31:30,107
Why am I so stupid?

448
00:31:30,107 --> 00:31:32,141
Why am I even here?

449
00:31:32,141 --> 00:31:34,407
How could I even think it was possible!

450
00:31:36,374 --> 00:31:38,474
- Let's get this sled, sliding man!

451
00:31:39,641 --> 00:31:42,507
What's up with the breaks in our existence?

452
00:31:42,507 --> 00:31:44,207
Always have to suck out our brain!

453
00:31:44,207 --> 00:31:48,074
Please make this baby run--

454
00:31:48,074 --> 00:31:50,007
- Shut up you hairy ferret!

455
00:32:04,641 --> 00:32:06,241
- They'll get you man!

456
00:32:06,241 --> 00:32:07,907
An army of zombies man!

457
00:32:07,907 --> 00:32:08,907
- Leave him!

458
00:32:10,241 --> 00:32:12,541
- Aren't you coming?

459
00:32:12,541 --> 00:32:13,774
- They're coming man!

460
00:32:13,774 --> 00:32:15,141
- How safe will you be in the car?

461
00:32:15,141 --> 00:32:16,374
- They're waiting for you man,

462
00:32:16,374 --> 00:32:18,607
the legion of the lifeless!

463
00:32:19,941 --> 00:32:21,407
Listen!

464
00:32:21,407 --> 00:32:23,107
I hear 'em!

465
00:32:23,107 --> 00:32:24,674
Listen to the sound of your doom man!

466
00:32:24,674 --> 00:32:26,507
They'll ambush you!

467
00:32:26,507 --> 00:32:30,007
- I'll take my chances outrunning them.

468
00:32:30,007 --> 00:32:31,941
You wanna wait for them to open up your head

469
00:32:31,941 --> 00:32:35,307
and eat your brain like it was Jello?

470
00:32:35,307 --> 00:32:37,074
- Leave the beat freak!

471
00:32:58,341 --> 00:33:01,574
You can walk with us, if you shut up!

472
00:33:01,574 --> 00:33:02,974
- You shut up!

473
00:33:02,974 --> 00:33:05,307
- Don't tell me to shut up, you shut up!

474
00:33:05,307 --> 00:33:06,774
- Shut up!

475
00:33:06,774 --> 00:33:09,007
- Will both of you shut up!

476
00:33:10,707 --> 00:33:11,841
Ow!

477
00:33:11,841 --> 00:33:13,841
Shush! - Ow, ow!

478
00:33:14,874 --> 00:33:16,874
Susie you hear anything?

479
00:33:18,041 --> 00:33:20,874
- Don't tell me you believe the creep?

480
00:33:20,874 --> 00:33:22,107
- Listen.

481
00:33:27,507 --> 00:33:29,407
Let's get off the road.

482
00:33:42,541 --> 00:33:44,474
My dad's gonna kill me!

483
00:33:45,641 --> 00:33:46,841
- I wouldn't worry about your dad.

484
00:33:46,841 --> 00:33:48,241
They're gonna kill us.

485
00:33:48,241 --> 00:33:50,074
- You don't understand, it took me six months

486
00:33:50,074 --> 00:33:52,207
to get my dad to let me drive his car.

487
00:33:52,207 --> 00:33:54,541
Now I got zombies making a mess out of it!

488
00:33:54,541 --> 00:33:56,741
- Who cares about your stupid dad,

489
00:33:56,741 --> 00:33:58,207
or your stupid car!

490
00:33:58,207 --> 00:33:59,074
- Yeah.

491
00:33:59,074 --> 00:34:00,574
I do!

492
00:34:00,574 --> 00:34:02,241
You wouldn't know, you don't have parents Maynard,

493
00:34:02,241 --> 00:34:03,074
beats are hatched!

494
00:34:04,741 --> 00:34:06,341
Baby...

495
00:34:33,074 --> 00:34:34,474
- Let's go!

496
00:34:34,474 --> 00:34:35,307
Leave him!

497
00:34:37,674 --> 00:34:39,041
What are you doing?

498
00:34:39,041 --> 00:34:39,874
Let's go!

499
00:34:41,074 --> 00:34:42,474
Help!

500
00:34:42,474 --> 00:34:45,541
Ignore it, it's a trick!

501
00:34:45,541 --> 00:34:46,941
Help me!

502
00:34:46,941 --> 00:34:49,507
Don't Johnny!

503
00:34:57,774 --> 00:34:58,941
- Help me man!

504
00:35:00,507 --> 00:35:03,507
- You could have done this yourself!

505
00:35:04,674 --> 00:35:07,341
- It proves you care man.

506
00:35:09,941 --> 00:35:11,107
- Watch out Johnny!

507
00:35:14,274 --> 00:35:16,774
- That's for taking Edna, man!

508
00:35:48,374 --> 00:35:50,007
- I think that's a house!

509
00:35:50,007 --> 00:35:51,774
- Well then what are we waiting for!

510
00:35:51,774 --> 00:35:54,207
- A goose from a zombie, man!

511
00:35:55,541 --> 00:35:58,774
I'm a cool cat, I'm no back-burner man.

512
00:36:19,407 --> 00:36:22,074
Ya! - Do you have to do that?

513
00:36:22,074 --> 00:36:23,407
Move over there!

514
00:36:26,607 --> 00:36:29,341
What are you hooligans doing here?

515
00:36:29,341 --> 00:36:30,174
Speak up!

516
00:36:31,107 --> 00:36:33,174
No secrets among friends.

517
00:36:34,474 --> 00:36:35,807
You are friends?

518
00:36:37,307 --> 00:36:39,374
'Cause I bury my enemies.

519
00:36:42,974 --> 00:36:47,107
There's an army of zombie beatniks, man!

520
00:36:47,107 --> 00:36:48,941
They're gonna suck out our brains!

521
00:36:48,941 --> 00:36:51,441
The end is near, daddy-o...

522
00:36:51,441 --> 00:36:53,707
- Did you say zombies?

523
00:37:03,774 --> 00:37:05,807
Recognize this?

524
00:37:05,807 --> 00:37:06,741
Why?

525
00:37:06,741 --> 00:37:07,874
- The Martians gave one to Jack!

526
00:37:07,874 --> 00:37:08,941
- Who's Jack?

527
00:37:08,941 --> 00:37:10,841
- He's my friend.

528
00:37:10,841 --> 00:37:12,174
No, he's a jerk.

529
00:37:13,474 --> 00:37:17,641
And now he's a zombie. - Know what it's for?

530
00:37:17,641 --> 00:37:19,141
Well I'll tell ya!

531
00:37:21,974 --> 00:37:24,541
When they're done with your friend...

532
00:37:24,541 --> 00:37:25,907
- He's not my friend.

533
00:37:25,907 --> 00:37:26,741
- Shut up!

534
00:37:28,574 --> 00:37:31,574
Your friend's gonna push this here button

535
00:37:31,574 --> 00:37:35,074
signaling the Martians, and it's all over.

536
00:37:36,174 --> 00:37:37,674
It's all too late.

537
00:37:38,874 --> 00:37:41,841
Don't let him push this here button!

538
00:37:45,074 --> 00:37:48,307
They've come back.

539
00:37:48,307 --> 00:37:50,741
- Back? - About 30 years ago,

540
00:37:52,607 --> 00:37:54,941
Martians came for our women.

541
00:37:56,641 --> 00:37:57,474
Took 10.

542
00:37:59,874 --> 00:38:02,574
Something about repopulating their planet,

543
00:38:02,574 --> 00:38:05,474
or some cockamamie story like that.

544
00:38:07,207 --> 00:38:10,141
I imagine they've come for 10 more.

545
00:38:11,807 --> 00:38:13,807
Took my Millie.

546
00:38:13,807 --> 00:38:15,574
I still have nightmares

547
00:38:15,574 --> 00:38:19,441
of them Martian freaks on top of my Millie.

548
00:38:19,441 --> 00:38:21,941
- If it's any consolation sir,

549
00:38:23,274 --> 00:38:25,674
they probably use this new scientific technique

550
00:38:25,674 --> 00:38:27,207
I've been reading about.

551
00:38:27,207 --> 00:38:29,641
- What the hell are you talking about?

552
00:38:29,641 --> 00:38:31,807
- It's not the birds and the bees thing,

553
00:38:31,807 --> 00:38:33,241
they use science.

554
00:38:34,741 --> 00:38:35,941
Johnny!

555
00:38:35,941 --> 00:38:37,974
- Or something-- - They turned my boys

556
00:38:37,974 --> 00:38:39,574
into zombie freaks!

557
00:38:41,174 --> 00:38:45,341
Those lazy space bums made my boys do their dirty work!

558
00:38:46,941 --> 00:38:48,474
- That was just a story!

559
00:38:48,474 --> 00:38:49,974
- Well I lived it!

560
00:38:51,207 --> 00:38:53,041
I had to kill my boys.

561
00:38:57,141 --> 00:39:00,007
I'll never forget that day.

562
00:39:00,007 --> 00:39:03,341
How do we know he's not one of them?

563
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:04,807
- We don't!

564
00:39:06,307 --> 00:39:10,074
- Well, I guess there's only one way to know for sure.

565
00:39:11,974 --> 00:39:13,274
Wait!

566
00:39:13,274 --> 00:39:14,907
He saved us!

567
00:39:19,474 --> 00:39:21,141
- Get to the kitchen!

568
00:39:26,507 --> 00:39:27,774
Horse feathers!

569
00:39:29,674 --> 00:39:33,941
Looks like I'll be joining ya' soon, Millie!

570
00:39:50,907 --> 00:39:53,341
Get to the tool shed in back!

571
00:39:53,341 --> 00:39:55,907
I'll hold them off long enough!

572
00:39:58,141 --> 00:39:59,474
Go you dumb kid!

573
00:40:00,874 --> 00:40:05,374
I'm an old man, you got your whole life ahead of you!

574
00:40:05,374 --> 00:40:09,207
Go dammit, stop those Martians from coming in!

575
00:40:10,674 --> 00:40:13,407
And god dammit, destroy that box!

576
00:40:22,707 --> 00:40:24,307
- Johnny, let's go!

577
00:40:55,541 --> 00:40:57,041
- Bar up the door!

578
00:41:01,641 --> 00:41:03,541
- What are you doing?

579
00:41:03,541 --> 00:41:05,541
- With an army of zombies seconds from killing us,

580
00:41:05,541 --> 00:41:06,474
and you're worried about--

581
00:41:06,474 --> 00:41:08,874
- Getting your clothes dirty?

582
00:41:13,174 --> 00:41:15,007
- You gonna golf all day?

583
00:41:15,007 --> 00:41:17,041
Hand me a nail, chicky!

584
00:41:17,041 --> 00:41:18,607
Flapping your tongue

585
00:41:18,607 --> 00:41:20,074
isn't gonna get us anywhere!

586
00:41:20,074 --> 00:41:22,241
- Ogling Oscar Mayer is?

587
00:41:22,241 --> 00:41:23,074
Man!

588
00:41:24,507 --> 00:41:25,741
- We should have let you

589
00:41:25,741 --> 00:41:28,807
to be moronized by your zombie friends!

590
00:41:28,807 --> 00:41:29,641
Man! - At least they had more

591
00:41:29,641 --> 00:41:31,374
brains than you, chicky!

592
00:41:31,374 --> 00:41:32,974
- If you call that brains I wouldn't want any of it!

593
00:41:36,174 --> 00:41:37,507
Back!

594
00:41:47,941 --> 00:41:50,674
- Enough lollygagging, chicky!

595
00:41:50,674 --> 00:41:51,507

- What's that man?

620
00:44:41,141 --> 00:44:43,107
- It is a replica of a ray gun

621
00:44:43,107 --> 00:44:45,774
found at the Roswell crash site.

622
00:44:46,807 --> 00:44:48,207
With one minor difference,

623
00:44:48,207 --> 00:44:51,574
ours is lacking the Martian power source, so...

624
00:45:06,641 --> 00:45:09,541
- That's about your size.

625
00:45:09,541 --> 00:45:11,874
- Suffering from envy, chicky?

626
00:45:11,874 --> 00:45:13,441
- Enough lollygagging!

627
00:45:27,141 --> 00:45:30,874
Shut up!

628
00:45:30,874 --> 00:45:32,241
- D-Day, children!

629
00:45:42,607 --> 00:45:43,441
Maynard!

630
00:45:43,441 --> 00:45:44,941
Susie, grab the saw!

631
00:46:18,641 --> 00:46:20,541
My arms are getting tired!

632
00:46:20,541 --> 00:46:22,107
Not mine!

633
00:46:30,341 --> 00:46:32,341
- Where are they all coming from?

634
00:46:37,907 --> 00:46:40,874
There's too many of 'em, I'm gonna blow a fuse!

635
00:46:40,874 --> 00:46:42,307
We're gonna have to make a run for it!

636
00:46:52,607 --> 00:46:53,607
Dang it!

637
00:46:53,607 --> 00:46:55,207
Let's go!

638
00:46:58,141 --> 00:47:00,074
What are you doing?

639
00:47:00,074 --> 00:47:00,907
Come on!

640
00:47:07,741 --> 00:47:09,241
- She'll be okay!

641
00:47:09,241 --> 00:47:11,841
They need her man, they won't hurt her, remember?

642
00:47:11,841 --> 00:47:13,641
We need to split!

643
00:47:13,641 --> 00:47:16,607
We need to split like now!

644
00:49:38,841 --> 00:49:41,007
Try it now!

645
00:50:26,774 --> 00:50:28,874
- We can't leave her!

646
00:50:28,874 --> 00:50:30,874
I've got to go back! - Be wise my man,

647
00:50:30,874 --> 00:50:32,074
we need help!

648
00:50:32,074 --> 00:50:32,907
We can't do it alone!

649
00:50:32,907 --> 00:50:34,274
She's okay!

650
00:50:34,274 --> 00:50:36,341
Use your cranium, gymnasium!

651
00:50:36,341 --> 00:50:37,707
How long do you think we'll last?

652
00:50:37,707 --> 00:50:40,041
They'll turn us into zombies man!

653
00:50:40,041 --> 00:50:41,441
You know that!

654
00:50:41,441 --> 00:50:44,274
You can't save Susie that way!

655
00:50:44,274 --> 00:50:45,541
- They won't get away with this!

656
00:50:45,541 --> 00:50:46,741
- I know, daddy-o, but in the meantime

657
00:50:46,741 --> 00:50:49,341
let's speed, get some help man!

658
00:50:53,541 --> 00:50:55,274
Where you going?

659
00:50:55,274 --> 00:50:57,841
Do you know where you're going?

660
00:51:12,374 --> 00:51:14,241
Let me go!

661
00:51:16,841 --> 00:51:17,674
Let me go!

662
00:51:47,207 --> 00:51:48,607
- We're lost man.

663
00:51:51,374 --> 00:51:53,141
Admit it, we're lost.

664
00:51:58,307 --> 00:52:00,974
- You lousy stinking beatnik!

665
00:52:00,974 --> 00:52:02,641
This all your fault!

666
00:52:03,807 --> 00:52:07,041
My first real date, with a cute girl,

667
00:52:07,041 --> 00:52:08,641
now she's a zombie!

668
00:52:14,274 --> 00:52:15,274
- She's not!

669
00:52:17,207 --> 00:52:20,707
They don't make chicks zombies man, right?

670
00:52:22,541 --> 00:52:26,274
Besides, if you were generous enough to call that a date,

671
00:52:26,274 --> 00:52:27,507
you wouldn't know what to do with it man.

672
00:52:27,507 --> 00:52:28,674
- I would to!

673
00:52:28,674 --> 00:52:30,574
- Name your last date before this one.

674
00:52:37,707 --> 00:52:39,707
This is your first date with someone other than your sister.

675
00:52:39,707 --> 00:52:40,941
- I don't have a sister!

676
00:52:40,941 --> 00:52:42,407
- Fine, your mother.

677
00:52:42,407 --> 00:52:44,007
- Like you would know what to do with a girl like Susie?

678
00:52:44,007 --> 00:52:46,074
- Sure, beats are cool cats.

679
00:52:46,074 --> 00:52:47,841
Cool cats get the chicks man.

680
00:52:47,841 --> 00:52:50,074
Chicks can't resist cool cats.

681
00:52:50,074 --> 00:52:53,474
It's a fact!

682
00:52:53,474 --> 00:52:54,607
It's a fact man.

683
00:52:54,607 --> 00:52:56,274
- So where is Edna? - Shut up!

684
00:52:56,274 --> 00:52:58,741
- The big bad Casanova beat couldn't keep Edna!

685
00:52:58,741 --> 00:53:01,074
- Shut up man! - You gonna make me?

686
00:53:01,074 --> 00:53:01,874
- Maybe!

687
00:53:02,841 --> 00:53:03,807
- Maybe?

688
00:53:03,807 --> 00:53:05,274
Baby!

689
00:54:11,141 --> 00:54:15,374

news bulletin!

Reports of strange lights and flying saucers,

695
00:54:26,241 --> 00:54:28,674
I repeat, flying saucers have been pouring in

696
00:54:28,674 --> 00:54:30,307
from all over the county, and now there's

697
00:54:30,307 --> 00:54:32,641
zombie attacks on females!

698
00:54:32,641 --> 00:54:34,774
Citizens are all advised to stay at home,

699
00:54:34,774 --> 00:54:37,541
hide your women, and above all, lock your doors!

700
00:54:37,541 --> 00:54:39,307
I repeat, lock your doors!

701
00:54:39,307 --> 00:54:40,541
That is all.

702
00:54:50,907 --> 00:54:54,241
- I didn't know a square could put down.

703
00:54:56,274 --> 00:55:00,274
- I guess we're both hits with the chicks.

704
00:55:00,274 --> 00:55:01,541
- You'd make a cool beat.

705
00:55:01,541 --> 00:55:02,374
- Thanks.

706
00:55:03,474 --> 00:55:04,941
You'd make a good square.

707
00:55:04,941 --> 00:55:05,874
I don't know if

708
00:55:05,874 --> 00:55:08,574
I should be thankful, man.

709
00:55:14,541 --> 00:55:15,374
- Listen!

710
00:55:17,207 --> 00:55:18,107
Listen man!

711
00:55:20,641 --> 00:55:23,607
Listen you stupid muscle head!

712
00:55:23,607 --> 00:55:24,974
- Think so?

713
00:55:24,974 --> 00:55:25,807
- No.

714
00:55:27,541 --> 00:55:29,341
Maybe a little.

715
00:55:31,574 --> 00:55:33,407
Listen, really listen...

716
00:55:39,541 --> 00:55:41,941
I propound that if we follow that sound,

717
00:55:41,941 --> 00:55:43,441
we can find Susie,

718
00:55:43,441 --> 00:55:46,641
or if we go in the opposite direction,

719
00:55:46,641 --> 00:55:47,974
we can get help.

720
00:55:53,174 --> 00:55:54,674
Now that that understanding washes over

721
00:55:54,674 --> 00:55:57,141
your suburban brain, I recommend

722
00:55:57,141 --> 00:55:59,807
that we go in the opposite direction and get help,

723
00:55:59,807 --> 00:56:01,941
and go back and save your fair maiden.

724
00:56:01,941 --> 00:56:03,741
- What are we waiting for?

725
00:56:03,741 --> 00:56:05,241
- A goose from-- - Don't bring Goose

726
00:56:05,241 --> 00:56:07,174
into this conversation.

727
00:57:55,907 --> 00:57:57,207
- What are you doing?

728
00:57:57,207 --> 00:57:59,707
Don't, stop, put me down!

729
00:57:59,707 --> 00:58:01,374
Stop, help!

730
00:58:03,741 --> 00:58:04,674
Help, help!

731
00:59:21,607 --> 00:59:23,207
- Ain't no way out.

732
00:59:28,407 --> 00:59:32,341
- If there was a way out we wouldn't be in here.

733
00:59:32,341 --> 00:59:33,774
- Do you think we're stupid?

734
00:59:33,774 --> 00:59:35,774
- You're too good?

735
00:59:50,674 --> 00:59:53,041
- Let's go daddy-o!

736
00:59:53,041 --> 00:59:53,874
- Wait!

737
01:00:09,907 --> 01:00:13,607
- Look, I know we're from different sides of the tracks,

738
01:00:16,207 --> 01:00:20,374
but, given the situation, I think we should call a truce,

739
01:00:21,507 --> 01:00:24,341
until, or if we ever get out of here.

740
01:00:46,141 --> 01:00:48,307
- Hey man could you pass me the five-eighths?

741
01:00:48,307 --> 01:00:49,741
This one's a little bit too small.

742
01:00:49,741 --> 01:00:51,174
Yeah yeah yeah.

743
01:00:51,174 --> 01:00:53,241
Thanks. - Whatever.

744
01:00:53,241 --> 01:00:54,207
Hey what are you?

745
01:00:54,207 --> 01:00:55,241
Let go of that, let go of that!

746
01:00:58,641 --> 01:01:02,607
- Hurry up we're gonna be late for the Chop Top show!

747
01:01:02,607 --> 01:01:04,741
What's the problem man, come on hurry up!

748
01:01:06,941 --> 01:01:07,774
Let's go!

749
01:01:10,274 --> 01:01:11,674
Come on man what are you doing?

750
01:01:11,674 --> 01:01:13,974
Let go, give me the wrench!

751
01:01:24,341 --> 01:01:26,874

752
01:01:39,274 --> 01:01:40,207
There it is!

753
01:01:40,207 --> 01:01:42,274
The Grange Hall, let's go!

754
01:01:45,707 --> 01:01:47,974
- I thought I was so smart.

755
01:01:49,974 --> 01:01:51,207
Now look at me.

756
01:01:53,074 --> 01:01:56,074
I suppose, in a way, I deserve this.

757
01:01:59,307 --> 01:02:00,407
It was cruel.

758
01:02:03,341 --> 01:02:07,507
I mean, he really likes me, and there's just no way...

759
01:02:10,307 --> 01:02:13,741
- You suburban types can't get past looks.

760
01:02:13,741 --> 01:02:17,574
Maybe we can because we don't have the luxury.

761
01:02:19,507 --> 01:02:23,307
We just don't pay that much attention to the obvious.

762
01:02:23,307 --> 01:02:26,474
If you do, I think you'll miss out on the guy

763
01:02:26,474 --> 01:02:28,507
that you're meant to be with.

764
01:02:28,507 --> 01:02:30,607
- What Einstein is saying,

765
01:02:30,607 --> 01:02:33,641
maybe you should give this guy a second look.

766
01:02:40,241 --> 01:02:41,441
- I'm Susie.

767
01:02:41,441 --> 01:02:42,274
- Betty.

768
01:02:43,407 --> 01:02:44,407
- I'm Candy.

769
01:02:46,407 --> 01:02:50,574
I warn you, call me Candice, and I'll bust your chops.

770
01:03:54,807 --> 01:03:57,107
Oh you like my jacket?

771
01:03:57,107 --> 01:03:59,974

772
01:03:59,974 --> 01:04:01,174

773
01:04:01,174 --> 01:04:03,041

774
01:04:03,041 --> 01:04:04,241
We pulled the lunch,

775
01:04:04,241 --> 01:04:05,707
we were in the pressure cooker for a minute.

776
01:04:05,707 --> 01:04:08,007
- Jumpin' jalopies!

777
01:04:08,007 --> 01:04:10,107

778
01:04:10,107 --> 01:04:11,507
- We have to save the world!

779
01:04:12,341 --> 01:04:13,541
- You do that!

780
01:04:13,541 --> 01:04:15,207
But remember, when I'm done here,

781
01:04:15,207 --> 01:04:16,474
I'm gonna kick both your butts!

782
01:04:16,474 --> 01:04:18,507
- Frank, if you're smarter than you look,

783
01:04:18,507 --> 01:04:20,207
you'd stay in the back seat.

784
01:04:20,207 --> 01:04:21,674
- What's that supposed to mean?

785
01:04:21,674 --> 01:04:23,541

01:14:35,574 --> 01:14:36,407
- Candy.

920
01:14:37,307 --> 01:14:38,374
- Maynard.

921
01:14:43,641 --> 01:14:46,641
- Is there still something on my face?

922
01:14:46,641 --> 01:14:47,974
- There sure is.

923
01:14:53,074 --> 01:14:53,907
- Aww...

924
01:15:10,674 --> 01:15:12,207
- What do you guys think about my gun?

925
01:15:12,207 --> 01:15:14,174
Isn't it the coolest?

926
01:15:14,174 --> 01:15:15,574
- Like you, Johnny!

927
01:15:18,041 --> 01:15:21,141
- You're pretty cool Johnny, even for a square.

928
01:15:21,141 --> 01:15:22,574
- You're a square?

929
01:15:22,574 --> 01:15:24,507
- Was, now I'm just me.

930
01:15:27,107 --> 01:15:30,274
- So, how are we supposed to get home?

931
01:15:31,574 --> 01:15:33,474
- It's a nice night out for a walk.

932
01:15:33,474 --> 01:15:35,441
- What are we waiting for?

933
01:15:35,441 --> 01:15:37,174
- A goose from a zombie?

934
01:15:37,174 --> 01:15:38,274
Don't!

935
01:15:40,074 --> 01:15:41,974
- I just wanted to get your goose.

936
01:15:45,407 --> 01:15:47,374
- Well if it's not my favorite pukes!

937
01:15:47,374 --> 01:15:48,674
- Get lost Frank!

938
01:15:48,674 --> 01:15:50,374
- You'll have to ask nicer than that,

939
01:15:50,374 --> 01:15:52,441
and maybe I'll go out with you.

940
01:15:52,441 --> 01:15:56,507
- Come on Frank, it's late, can we finish this tomorrow?

941
01:15:57,341 --> 01:15:58,407
- What are you doing?

942
01:15:58,407 --> 01:16:00,841
- Trying to be nice.

943
01:16:00,841 --> 01:16:02,207
Get along.

944
01:16:02,207 --> 01:16:04,807
- You won't embarrass me again.

945
01:16:07,841 --> 01:16:09,574
- Can we have a ride?

946
01:16:12,907 --> 01:16:14,574
- How much money you got?

947
01:16:14,574 --> 01:16:17,507
- Is that offer still good?

948
01:16:17,507 --> 01:16:20,707
You know the one where I can take my best shot?

949
01:16:20,707 --> 01:16:21,974
- Oh, uh, yeah.

950
01:16:38,207 --> 01:16:39,207
Can't do it.

951
01:16:41,607 --> 01:16:43,807
It's just that we're friends, Frank, and,

952
01:16:43,807 --> 01:16:46,907
gosh, it just doesn't seem right.

953
01:16:46,907 --> 01:16:48,574
- Yeah really?

954
01:16:48,574 --> 01:16:49,807
Johnny, baby...

955
01:16:53,707 --> 01:16:57,207
- Are we finished now Frankie baby?

956
01:16:57,207 --> 01:16:59,141
Are you sure, Frankie baby?

957
01:16:59,141 --> 01:17:03,241
I mean, we really didn't even get started.

958
01:17:03,241 --> 01:17:05,907
I'm not having fun yet, are you?

959
01:17:07,107 --> 01:17:08,441
Maybe next time.

960
01:17:10,741 --> 01:17:13,907
Oh yeah, Frank, can I borrow your car?

961
01:17:25,307 --> 01:17:26,874
- Jumpin' jalopies!

962
01:17:26,874 --> 01:17:27,974
I gotta get out of here!

963
01:17:30,407 --> 01:17:33,341
Beatniks, zombies, Martians, aaaaa!

964
01:17:34,974 --> 01:17:38,307
- And I've been waiting for 'em to come back ever since.

965
01:17:38,307 --> 01:17:40,441
That's why I'm up here.

966
01:17:40,441 --> 01:17:41,541
You seen any?

967
01:17:44,274 --> 01:17:46,207
You sure? - Yes!

968
01:17:46,207 --> 01:17:47,807
We're positive!

969
01:17:47,807 --> 01:17:49,374
No Martians, no zombies!

970
01:17:49,374 --> 01:17:50,774
You can come out of the cave!

971
01:17:50,774 --> 01:17:53,474
- I'm not feeling so good.

972
01:17:53,474 --> 01:17:55,407
I don't feel good at all.

973
01:17:55,407 --> 01:17:57,107
You got any marijuana?

974
01:17:57,107 --> 01:17:58,974
Burnout.

975
01:17:58,974 --> 01:18:00,274
Anna! - Ran out about

976
01:18:00,274 --> 01:18:01,607
a week ago. - Come on you got your story!

977
01:18:01,607 --> 01:18:02,641
Now let's go home!

978
01:18:02,641 --> 01:18:03,874
- I've been feeling edgy

979
01:18:03,874 --> 01:18:04,674
ever since. - You can go home if you

980
01:18:04,674 --> 01:18:05,874
want to, just, just go.

981
01:18:05,874 --> 01:18:07,174
- You know, I found these strange cigarettes

982
01:18:07,174 --> 01:18:08,441
in this metal box,

983
01:18:08,441 --> 01:18:09,607
Sir? - and I figured the beatniks

984
01:18:09,607 --> 01:18:10,274
brought it and left them behind...

985
01:18:10,274 --> 01:18:11,341
No, sir?

986
01:18:11,341 --> 01:18:14,374
Uh, you swear this is true?

987
01:18:14,374 --> 01:18:17,007
- I swear on my dead mother's grave,

988
01:18:17,007 --> 01:18:19,241
god rest her soul, it's true!

989
01:18:19,241 --> 01:18:21,607
I've, it's as real as Roswell!

990
01:18:21,607 --> 01:18:23,374
Please, this is not real.

991
01:18:23,374 --> 01:18:24,607
Uh, is too! - Is not!

992
01:18:24,607 --> 01:18:25,641
Is too! - Is not!

993
01:18:25,641 --> 01:18:26,474
Is too! - Is not!

994
01:18:26,474 --> 01:18:27,874
- Will you shut up!

995
01:18:27,874 --> 01:18:30,041
Your giving me a headache!

996
01:18:32,241 --> 01:18:33,374
What's it like out there?

997
01:18:33,374 --> 01:18:34,307
I don't think you'd like

998
01:18:34,307 --> 01:18:36,574
the 21st century very much.

999
01:18:36,574 --> 01:18:38,074
- Any zombies?

1000
01:18:38,074 --> 01:18:40,374
No, no beatniks either, they're all gone,

1001
01:18:40,374 --> 01:18:43,007
extinct, you know, kind of like the dinosaurs.

1002
01:18:43,007 --> 01:18:43,841
- Are you sure?

1003
01:18:43,841 --> 01:18:45,507
- Enough already!

1004
01:18:45,507 --> 01:18:47,307
You can believe whatever you want to believe,

1005
01:18:47,307 --> 01:18:48,674
Wait! - but let's go home!

1006
01:18:48,674 --> 01:18:49,641
- I got proof!

1007
01:18:49,641 --> 01:18:50,807
I can show ya!

1008
01:18:52,574 --> 01:18:55,474
Yeah, yeah it's here, ain't it, oh!

1009
01:18:57,674 --> 01:18:59,407
It's Johnny's ray gun!

1010
01:18:59,407 --> 01:19:01,774
Oh my god!

1011
01:19:01,774 --> 01:19:04,041
- Yeah, yeah hold it chief.

1012
01:19:05,374 --> 01:19:08,574
Of course, it hasn't worked in a long time, but,

1013
01:19:08,574 --> 01:19:10,941
that's it, it's real, that's your proof!

1014
01:19:10,941 --> 01:19:12,974
Yeah, that's your proof!

1015
01:19:12,974 --> 01:19:14,807
Do you believe me now?

1016
01:19:16,007 --> 01:19:16,941
Of course...

1017
01:19:16,941 --> 01:19:18,174
You got a name?

1018
01:19:19,674 --> 01:19:21,041
I'm Rocky!

1019
01:19:21,041 --> 01:19:22,607
Right here, yeah...
