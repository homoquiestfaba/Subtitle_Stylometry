00:00:14,066 --> 00:00:16,033
You said you had information
about an attack.

4
00:00:16,035 --> 00:00:17,418
- I have information.
- Prove it.

5
00:00:17,452 --> 00:00:18,970
Aah!

6
00:00:18,971 --> 00:00:21,700
Homeland - 4x00
"Debrief"

7
00:00:21,707 --> 00:00:23,374
I'm very attracted to this show

8
00:00:23,376 --> 00:00:26,210
because it's
incredibly gripping.

9
00:00:26,261 --> 00:00:27,345
What were his exact words?

10
00:00:27,379 --> 00:00:29,096
An American prisoner of war

11
00:00:29,131 --> 00:00:30,381
has been turned.

12
00:00:30,415 --> 00:00:35,520
If you tell a story well,
people will come.

13
00:00:37,055 --> 00:00:38,890
I am not a terrorist.

14
00:00:38,941 --> 00:00:41,392
I have never been so sure

15
00:00:41,394 --> 00:00:43,277
and so wrong.

16
00:00:43,312 --> 00:00:45,062
I'll do whatever it takes.

17
00:00:45,113 --> 00:00:46,397
He's here!

18
00:00:46,448 --> 00:00:47,982
I'm afraid
you've got this backwards.

19
00:00:48,033 --> 00:00:50,284
I'm the one getting nominated
as Director.

20
00:00:50,319 --> 00:00:51,335
Brody!

21
00:00:51,336 --> 00:00:55,243
_

22
00:00:55,958 --> 00:00:59,043
"Homeland" is about a POW

23
00:00:59,077 --> 00:01:00,461
who has been rescued

24
00:01:00,495 --> 00:01:04,081
after eight years
of really brutal captivity.

25
00:01:04,132 --> 00:01:05,967
Stay down!

26
00:01:06,001 --> 00:01:08,252
I'm an American.

27
00:01:08,254 --> 00:01:12,256
Nicholas Brody
is brought back a hero,

28
00:01:12,258 --> 00:01:15,760
but the main character
of this show, Carrie Mathison,

29
00:01:15,811 --> 00:01:17,762
is unconvinced by this guy.

30
00:01:20,065 --> 00:01:22,850
Carrie Mathison
is a CIA operative.

31
00:01:22,901 --> 00:01:25,903
She's extremely driven
and focused.

32
00:01:25,938 --> 00:01:28,072
I missed something once before.

33
00:01:28,106 --> 00:01:29,490
I won't let that happen again.

34
00:01:29,524 --> 00:01:31,275
Part of her brilliance

35
00:01:31,277 --> 00:01:33,945
has to do with
her being bipolar.

36
00:01:33,947 --> 00:01:38,249
She's really
on the edge of sanity.

37
00:01:39,534 --> 00:01:43,170
Carrie intuits that
this hero has been turned

38
00:01:43,205 --> 00:01:45,756
and is working
for the other side.

39
00:01:45,791 --> 00:01:47,291
Did you ever meet him?

40
00:01:47,342 --> 00:01:49,093
Abu Nazir?

41
00:01:49,127 --> 00:01:52,129
- Was he ever present during
any of your interrogations? - No.

42
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:56,267
She illicitly starts
observing him very closely.

43
00:01:58,387 --> 00:01:59,437
I'm sorry.

44
00:01:59,471 --> 00:02:01,689
Hey, I know you.

45
00:02:01,723 --> 00:02:03,140
There's a recognition
between them.

46
00:02:03,191 --> 00:02:06,027
Where was it you said
you served again? Baghdad?

47
00:02:06,061 --> 00:02:07,311
Yeah.

48
00:02:07,362 --> 00:02:09,030
How come it's so hard
to talk about

49
00:02:09,064 --> 00:02:10,448
with people who weren't there?

50
00:02:10,482 --> 00:02:14,035
They think
they're playing each other.

51
00:02:14,069 --> 00:02:15,870
They do fall in love.

52
00:02:15,904 --> 00:02:17,989
But it's a doomed romance.

53
00:02:17,991 --> 00:02:19,240
I know I have oatmeal,

54
00:02:19,291 --> 00:02:21,993
but no Yorkshire Gold
out here in the sticks.

55
00:02:22,044 --> 00:02:23,210
Sorry.

56
00:02:23,245 --> 00:02:25,913
How do you know
the tea I drink?

57
00:02:27,499 --> 00:02:31,002
Did you spy on me?
You are a spy, right?

58
00:02:31,053 --> 00:02:32,503
Very quickly,

59
00:02:32,505 --> 00:02:36,223
we learn that Brody might not be
everything he seems.

60
00:02:36,258 --> 00:02:38,009
By the time you watch this,

61
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:40,394
you'll have read
a lot of things about me.

62
00:02:40,429 --> 00:02:43,764
Brody does wear a suicide vest

63
00:02:43,815 --> 00:02:48,019
into a basement
with the Vice President.

64
00:02:49,104 --> 00:02:53,074
Sergeant Brody, got a call
for you from your daughter.

65
00:02:54,192 --> 00:02:56,327
Brody is brought back
from the edge

66
00:02:56,361 --> 00:02:58,829
because of his love
for his daughter.

67
00:02:58,864 --> 00:03:00,114
Dad, promise me.

68
00:03:00,165 --> 00:03:01,449
You have to promise me

69
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,451
that you're coming home, dad.

70
00:03:03,502 --> 00:03:06,921
I'm coming home, Dana.

71
00:03:06,955 --> 00:03:10,374
Carrie is vindicated
by the audience,

72
00:03:10,376 --> 00:03:14,295
but no one, including her,
is aware of how right she was.

73
00:03:14,346 --> 00:03:15,963
I'm sorry.

74
00:03:16,014 --> 00:03:19,884
She sends herself
to get electro-shock therapy.

75
00:03:22,854 --> 00:03:25,890
That's where we leave Season 1.

76
00:03:26,417 --> 00:03:30,500
_

77
00:03:30,529 --> 00:03:33,230
Brody is able to keep it
a secret for a while,

78
00:03:33,281 --> 00:03:36,784
but Saul comes back
with information.

79
00:03:36,818 --> 00:03:39,070
Everyone knows
what Brody tried to do.

80
00:03:39,121 --> 00:03:40,988
<i>My name is Nicholas Brody.</i>

81
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:43,074
I was right.

82
00:03:43,076 --> 00:03:45,242
You were right.

83
00:03:45,293 --> 00:03:47,211
So you want to follow Brody?

84
00:03:47,245 --> 00:03:48,829
I'm sending you a guy.

85
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,798
Peter Quinn
is a Black Ops agent.

86
00:03:50,832 --> 00:03:52,750
He's effectively a mercenary.

87
00:03:52,752 --> 00:03:55,886
If Quinn is doing it,
it never happened.

88
00:03:55,921 --> 00:03:57,755
She had been right all along,

89
00:03:57,806 --> 00:04:01,759
and that fills her
with an enormous rage.

90
00:04:01,761 --> 00:04:03,144
I liked you, Carrie.

91
00:04:03,178 --> 00:04:04,345
I <i>loved</i> you.

92
00:04:04,396 --> 00:04:06,731
Freeze!
Hands be your back!

93
00:04:06,765 --> 00:04:08,099
You're a traitor
and a terrorist,

94
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:09,934
and now it's time
you pay for that.

95
00:04:12,938 --> 00:04:14,271
The big theme in Season 2

96
00:04:14,322 --> 00:04:18,025
was Brody being turned
into a double agent.

97
00:04:18,076 --> 00:04:19,860
I can do this, Saul.

98
00:04:19,911 --> 00:04:22,913
What is Abu Nazir's plan?

99
00:04:22,948 --> 00:04:24,281
I don't know.

100
00:04:24,283 --> 00:04:27,535
But there is a plan, right?

101
00:04:27,586 --> 00:04:28,586
Yes.

102
00:04:30,756 --> 00:04:33,791
Carrie Mathison
is then captured by Abu Nazir.

103
00:04:33,842 --> 00:04:35,676
What have you done to Carrie?

104
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:37,878
Did you think you could
betray me and just walk away?

105
00:04:37,929 --> 00:04:39,964
Brody has to effect
some sort of rescue.

106
00:04:40,015 --> 00:04:41,766
Walden has a bad heart.

107
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:44,852
His pacemaker
can be wirelessly accessed

108
00:04:44,886 --> 00:04:45,886
with that serial number.

109
00:04:45,937 --> 00:04:47,555
What are you doing?!

110
00:04:47,606 --> 00:04:50,107
I'm killing you.

111
00:04:51,243 --> 00:04:53,978
Nazir allows Carrie to leave.

112
00:04:54,029 --> 00:04:56,981
She, above all,
wants to capture this guy,

113
00:04:57,032 --> 00:04:59,400
and so she goes after him.

114
00:05:04,039 --> 00:05:08,826
Now Brody has fulfilled
his immunity deal,

115
00:05:08,877 --> 00:05:10,294
and in Carrie's case,

116
00:05:10,328 --> 00:05:13,414
it means possibly having
a personal life with Brody.

117
00:05:13,465 --> 00:05:16,750
And just when you think
everything is rosy...

118
00:05:16,802 --> 00:05:19,170
Somebody moved my car.

119
00:05:21,139 --> 00:05:25,309
...the CIA blows up
right underneath their noses,

120
00:05:25,343 --> 00:05:29,313
and it seems as though
Brody planted the bomb.

121
00:05:31,817 --> 00:05:33,150
In an act of desperation,

122
00:05:33,185 --> 00:05:35,986
Carrie drives Brody
to the border.

123
00:05:38,773 --> 00:05:40,441
This was love.

124
00:05:40,492 --> 00:05:42,493
But it's not goodbye.

125
00:05:46,475 --> 00:05:50,500
_

126
00:05:50,835 --> 00:05:52,336
We start with Season 3.

127
00:05:52,387 --> 00:05:54,721
It's really steeped

128
00:05:54,756 --> 00:05:57,508
in the cloak-and-dagger world
of the CIA.

129
00:05:57,510 --> 00:06:00,644
The President wants closure
for the American people, Saul.

130
00:06:00,678 --> 00:06:04,264
Brody's the poster boy
for this attack.

131
00:06:04,315 --> 00:06:06,350
Saul may be the last Director
of the CIA

132
00:06:06,401 --> 00:06:08,185
unless he does
something profound.

133
00:06:08,236 --> 00:06:10,354
The case officer in question--

134
00:06:10,405 --> 00:06:12,189
she's been diagnosed as bipolar.

135
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,690
Get off of me.

136
00:06:13,741 --> 00:06:15,242
This is a scam!

137
00:06:16,661 --> 00:06:18,328
Where we thought

138
00:06:18,363 --> 00:06:20,030
Carrie was actually being
sold down the river by Saul,

139
00:06:20,081 --> 00:06:22,332
we realize that they've been
in cahoots all along.

140
00:06:22,367 --> 00:06:24,668
Burning her
in front of the Senate?

141
00:06:24,702 --> 00:06:27,538
All an act. We dangled her
to draw the Iranians out.

142
00:06:27,589 --> 00:06:29,339
Javadi himself.

143
00:06:29,374 --> 00:06:30,541
From now on, you work for us.

144
00:06:30,543 --> 00:06:32,593
I'm gonna play you
back into Iran.

145
00:06:32,627 --> 00:06:34,511
Where am I?

146
00:06:34,546 --> 00:06:37,598
Caracas, your new home.

147
00:06:37,632 --> 00:06:39,550
I have a play.

148
00:06:39,601 --> 00:06:41,218
It involves Brody.

149
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:43,554
So, what is it?
What's your big idea?

150
00:06:43,556 --> 00:06:46,890
Danesh Akbari.
I want him gone.

151
00:06:48,142 --> 00:06:50,561
- Brody can get to him.
- Ohh!

152
00:06:50,563 --> 00:06:52,729
Brody completing this mission--

153
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:56,366
there's a sense
that he will redeem himself.

154
00:06:56,401 --> 00:06:58,902
For him, personally,
it's extremely important.

155
00:07:01,606 --> 00:07:03,991
It becomes very clear to him

156
00:07:04,042 --> 00:07:08,128
killing another human being is
a soul-destroying thing to do.

157
00:07:08,162 --> 00:07:10,080
There is no redemption for him,

158
00:07:10,082 --> 00:07:11,548
and Carrie really has one thing

159
00:07:11,583 --> 00:07:14,084
to bring him back
to some sense of humanity.

160
00:07:14,135 --> 00:07:16,303
I'm pregnant.

161
00:07:16,337 --> 00:07:18,672
Briefly, he feels
just a sense of hope,

162
00:07:18,723 --> 00:07:22,309
but I think Brody is a character
with little hope.

163
00:07:22,343 --> 00:07:23,510
Brody, run!

164
00:07:23,561 --> 00:07:25,562
Get down now!

165
00:07:25,597 --> 00:07:28,599
He appeared this morning
before a military tribunal,

166
00:07:28,650 --> 00:07:31,144
where he was sentenced to death
by hanging.

167
00:07:31,261 --> 00:07:32,700
Oh, God!

168
00:07:34,105 --> 00:07:35,989
We really had a fantastic time

169
00:07:36,024 --> 00:07:38,525
figuring out how this was
all gonna come to a close.

170
00:07:38,576 --> 00:07:41,612
We've covered so much landscape
between these two characters.

171
00:07:41,663 --> 00:07:42,996
And this is it.

172
00:07:43,031 --> 00:07:45,282
The Brody part of the story
is done.

173
00:07:45,284 --> 00:07:46,366
Brody!

174
00:07:53,258 --> 00:07:55,292
Goodbye, love.

175
00:07:58,561 --> 00:08:02,500
_

176
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:05,969
In Season 4, we find Carrie,

177
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:08,639
six months later,
working overseas.

178
00:08:08,690 --> 00:08:10,307
We're all hoping

179
00:08:10,309 --> 00:08:11,642
you'll be on your best behavior
here in Pakistan.

180
00:08:11,693 --> 00:08:15,279
Her job is
to perform drone attacks,

181
00:08:15,313 --> 00:08:18,198
and she's doing
a little too well.

182
00:08:18,232 --> 00:08:21,318
Until something
goes very, very wrong.

183
00:08:25,239 --> 00:08:26,740
- Saul.
- Carrie.

184
00:08:26,791 --> 00:08:28,241
What's going on?

185
00:08:28,293 --> 00:08:31,161
We watch Saul
be replaced by Lockhart.

186
00:08:31,212 --> 00:08:33,497
So he's no longer
the head of the CIA.

187
00:08:33,499 --> 00:08:35,082
He's in the private sector.

188
00:08:35,133 --> 00:08:36,416
I don't know if "Retirement"

189
00:08:36,467 --> 00:08:39,386
is a word that fits
with Saul Berenson.

190
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:41,755
I think we're walking away
with the job half done.

191
00:08:41,806 --> 00:08:42,756
Saul, could I speak with you?

192
00:08:42,807 --> 00:08:45,509
He is a manipulator.

193
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:47,177
We haven't really been
talking much lately, Carrie.

194
00:08:47,228 --> 00:08:49,680
He'll probably
find his way back.

195
00:08:49,682 --> 00:08:51,348
What I wanted to talk about,
I couldn't.

196
00:08:52,684 --> 00:08:54,584
So you're worried about her?

197
00:08:54,619 --> 00:08:56,353
I know the warning signs.
Believe me.

198
00:08:56,355 --> 00:08:59,690
Quinn is working for the CIA,

199
00:08:59,692 --> 00:09:01,274
not quite wearing a tie,

200
00:09:01,326 --> 00:09:02,693
but slightly less blood
on his hands.

201
00:09:02,695 --> 00:09:04,945
I controlled myself
for 12 years.

202
00:09:04,996 --> 00:09:08,582
He's fast losing respect
for pretty much everything.

203
00:09:11,119 --> 00:09:14,121
Carrie's all work all the time,

204
00:09:14,172 --> 00:09:17,341
and she can't really engage
on any other level.

205
00:09:17,375 --> 00:09:20,510
She has to come to terms
with Brody's loss.

206
00:09:20,545 --> 00:09:23,296
That's her arc.

207
00:09:23,348 --> 00:09:27,184
It's very difficult being in
the same space with her child.

208
00:09:27,218 --> 00:09:29,052
It evokes Brody.

209
00:09:29,103 --> 00:09:31,221
She's gonna need her mother
to be there for her.

210
00:09:31,272 --> 00:09:33,056
I don't have a choice.

211
00:09:33,058 --> 00:09:36,393
It's way too confronting.

212
00:09:36,444 --> 00:09:39,196
This season,
the band has got to snap.

213
00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:42,282
She cannot tolerate
her culpability.

214
00:09:42,316 --> 00:09:44,618
- What the hell is wrong with you?!
- What is wrong with you?!

215
00:09:44,652 --> 00:09:46,036
It gets ugly.

216
00:09:46,070 --> 00:09:47,571
Jesus, Quinn.

217
00:09:47,573 --> 00:09:50,123
Now it's starting
to just spin out of control.

218
00:09:50,158 --> 00:09:52,209
Ma'am, you have blood
all over the side of your face.

219
00:09:52,243 --> 00:09:53,243
People must know the truth.

220
00:09:53,294 --> 00:09:54,961
I want to be the one
to tell it.

221
00:09:54,962 --> 00:09:56,200
THIS OCTOBER

222
00:09:56,247 --> 00:09:57,748
Are you
in some kind of trouble?

223
00:09:57,749 --> 00:09:58,533
THERE'S

224
00:09:59,142 --> 00:09:59,950
NO

225
00:09:59,984 --> 00:10:01,484
- Carrie, no!
- PLACE

226
00:10:01,485 --> 00:10:02,753
LIKE

227
00:10:06,257 --> 00:10:08,725
Happy hunting.
