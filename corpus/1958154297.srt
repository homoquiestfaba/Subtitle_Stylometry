1
00:00:54,778 --> 00:00:56,580
A light existed in the corner

2
00:00:56,723 --> 00:00:57,807
Of the room.

3
00:00:57,808 --> 00:01:00,643
A small, yellow triangle of
light.

4
00:01:00,644 --> 00:01:03,646
Her eyes caught it, held it.

5
00:01:03,647 --> 00:01:07,858
Magic they were, golden and
devouring.

6
00:01:07,859 --> 00:01:12,571
A decade ago, I was their
willing prisoner.

7
00:01:12,572 --> 00:01:15,408
A lock held my heart.

8
00:01:15,409 --> 00:01:17,785
Chained. Chained.

9
00:01:17,786 --> 00:01:20,288
Chained me to her.

10
00:01:20,289 --> 00:01:24,834
And when, at last, I broke free,
I realized the meters and miles,

11
00:01:24,835 --> 00:01:29,213
how far I'd come in the wrong
direction and how much further I

12
00:01:29,214 --> 00:01:31,967
needed to go to ever find her
again.

13
00:02:21,767 --> 00:02:23,018
Ha!

14
00:02:33,278 --> 00:02:37,782
Ah. Right here. Good.

15
00:02:37,783 --> 00:02:41,660
Here.

16
00:02:41,661 --> 00:02:43,245
Good. Now you can poise up.

17
00:02:43,246 --> 00:02:45,414
I really want you to go deeper
now.

18
00:02:45,415 --> 00:02:46,916
Good. Right through here.

19
00:02:46,917 --> 00:02:48,042
Pull you up.

20
00:02:48,043 --> 00:02:49,752
Good. Feel your body.

21
00:02:49,753 --> 00:02:53,339
Good. And send this energy out
to each other.

22
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:57,593
Let it mix in the room and send
through each other.

23
00:02:57,594 --> 00:03:00,513
Good. Make some sound.

24
00:03:00,514 --> 00:03:02,640
Good. You got to make sound.

25
00:03:02,641 --> 00:03:05,810
A little more right here.

26
00:03:05,811 --> 00:03:09,688
Good. Good. Good.

27
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:12,358
Good. And right here.

28
00:03:12,359 --> 00:03:14,443
A teeny little bit back here.

29
00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:15,237
Come on.

30
00:03:15,238 --> 00:03:20,783
Come on. Deeper.

31
00:03:20,784 --> 00:03:22,368
Go deeper.

32
00:03:22,369 --> 00:03:25,328
Okay.

33
00:03:25,329 --> 00:03:27,164
Uh, keep working that head.

34
00:03:27,165 --> 00:03:27,749
Okay?

35
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:30,459
Good.

36
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:31,544
Good.

37
00:03:31,545 --> 00:03:33,129
Into each other. Come on.

38
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:34,839
We're gonna have a good day.

39
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:38,926
Good. Good.

40
00:03:38,927 --> 00:03:40,594
Bring it back here.

41
00:03:40,595 --> 00:03:42,054
Excellent. Excellent.

42
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:45,099
A light existed in the corner
of the room.

43
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:47,601
A small, yellow triangle of
light.

44
00:03:47,602 --> 00:03:49,520
Her eyes caught it, held it.

45
00:03:49,521 --> 00:03:52,273
Magic they were, golden and
devouring.

46
00:03:52,274 --> 00:03:55,316
A decade ago, I was their
willing prisoner.

47
00:03:55,317 --> 00:03:57,027
A lock held my heart.

48
00:03:57,028 --> 00:03:58,446
Chained. Chained.

49
00:03:58,447 --> 00:03:59,947
Chained me to her.

50
00:03:59,948 --> 00:04:03,200
And when, at last, I broke free,
I realized the meters and miles,

51
00:04:03,201 --> 00:04:06,287
how far I'd come in the wrong
direction and how much further I

52
00:04:06,288 --> 00:04:08,247
needed to go to ever find her
again.

53
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:12,127
And what does it mean?

54
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:14,795
I don't know.

55
00:04:14,796 --> 00:04:19,049
Well, what does it mean to you?

56
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:20,676
Love?

57
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:21,428
Lost love?

58
00:04:21,429 --> 00:04:22,761
Are you asking me?

59
00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:26,182
Because if you're asking me,
then you obviously don't know.

60
00:04:26,183 --> 00:04:28,934
And if you don't know, then why
are you here?

61
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:30,478
You need to know Victor.

62
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:31,937
You need to learn him.

63
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:34,773
You need to understand his
wants, his needs.

64
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:40,196
You need to understand where
he's been and where he's going.

65
00:04:40,197 --> 00:04:43,657
James, we've been working on
this monologue for about three

66
00:04:43,658 --> 00:04:44,534
weeks, maybe.

67
00:04:44,535 --> 00:04:47,745
And to be honest with you, we
haven't gotten that far.

68
00:04:47,746 --> 00:04:49,455
So, what do I need to do?

69
00:04:49,456 --> 00:04:52,416
I can only answer that
question so many times.

70
00:04:52,417 --> 00:04:53,959
You need to ask yourself.

71
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:57,505
You need to find the girl with
the golden eyes, whomever she

72
00:04:57,506 --> 00:05:00,508
may be, to you.

73
00:05:00,509 --> 00:05:03,177
To Victor.

74
00:05:03,178 --> 00:05:04,970
Maybe I'm not meant to do this.

75
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:07,681
Maybe not.

76
00:05:07,682 --> 00:05:10,851
All I know is you came to my
class for a reason.

77
00:05:10,852 --> 00:05:14,605
I'm willing to teach you, but at
some point, you have to be

78
00:05:14,606 --> 00:05:16,774
willing to try.

79
00:05:16,775 --> 00:05:18,442
I'm sorry.

80
00:05:18,443 --> 00:05:20,569
Don't be sorry.

81
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:24,281
Just do the work.

82
00:05:24,282 --> 00:05:26,200
Okay.

83
00:05:26,201 --> 00:05:28,035
It's 10 to 4:00.

84
00:05:28,036 --> 00:05:30,871
How about we call it a wrap?

85
00:05:30,872 --> 00:05:34,792
I'll give you 10 minutes at the
end of next session.

86
00:05:34,793 --> 00:05:36,794
You want a cup of coffee?

87
00:05:36,795 --> 00:05:37,920
Sure.

88
00:05:37,921 --> 00:05:39,881
Okay. Come on.

89
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:56,898
Aah!

90
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:10,286
You will look amazing.

91
00:06:10,287 --> 00:06:13,164
Why not?

92
00:06:54,039 --> 00:06:54,998
Hello.

93
00:06:54,999 --> 00:06:56,498
Hi!

94
00:06:56,499 --> 00:06:57,875
What is all this?

95
00:06:57,876 --> 00:06:59,335
Oh, this is heavy.

96
00:06:59,336 --> 00:07:00,711
I'm cooking for you.

97
00:07:00,712 --> 00:07:01,254
Here.

98
00:07:01,255 --> 00:07:02,838
Where's Sylvia?

99
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:03,798
Serafina.

100
00:07:03,799 --> 00:07:05,007
Oh, serafina.

101
00:07:05,008 --> 00:07:05,842
Hello.

102
00:07:05,842 --> 00:07:06,468
Hi.

103
00:07:06,468 --> 00:07:07,218
Hola.

104
00:07:07,219 --> 00:07:08,344
Hey.

105
00:07:08,345 --> 00:07:09,179
How are you?

106
00:07:09,179 --> 00:07:09,929
Fine. You?

107
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:11,055
Oh, so you think?

108
00:07:11,056 --> 00:07:12,181
Good, good, good.

109
00:07:12,182 --> 00:07:13,474
Can I help something?

110
00:07:13,475 --> 00:07:14,059
To cook?

111
00:07:14,059 --> 00:07:14,976
Do you cook?

112
00:07:14,977 --> 00:07:16,977
Of course I cook.

113
00:07:16,978 --> 00:07:17,937
Here.

114
00:07:17,938 --> 00:07:19,521
Oh, thank you!

115
00:07:19,522 --> 00:07:20,940
They're so beautiful.

116
00:07:22,192 --> 00:07:23,902
Can I get you ladies some wine?

117
00:07:24,486 --> 00:07:25,528
Uh, me too.

118
00:07:51,012 --> 00:07:54,349
Hey.

119
00:07:57,686 --> 00:07:59,646
Brit?

120
00:08:04,025 --> 00:08:06,193
Hey.

121
00:08:06,194 --> 00:08:07,444
What are you doing?

122
00:08:07,445 --> 00:08:08,612
Why is your dad here?

123
00:08:08,613 --> 00:08:10,823
Look, I don't want to talk
about it.

124
00:08:10,824 --> 00:08:13,534
You can't tell me that right
now when you're in the middle of

125
00:08:13,535 --> 00:08:14,160
moving out.

126
00:08:14,161 --> 00:08:16,120
If not now, when are we gonna
talk about it?

127
00:08:16,121 --> 00:08:17,204
James, come on, okay?

128
00:08:17,205 --> 00:08:18,414
Don't start this right now.

129
00:08:18,415 --> 00:08:19,748
Is it because I quit my job?

130
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:22,960
James, go figure yourself
out, okay?

131
00:08:22,961 --> 00:08:27,423
'Cause I-I can't do this
anymore.

132
00:08:27,424 --> 00:08:29,384
Yeah, I'll be down in a sec.

133
00:08:34,472 --> 00:08:35,596
So, is this it?

134
00:08:35,597 --> 00:08:37,099
I'll never see you again?

135
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:40,936
You've always owned my heart.

136
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:42,897
I think you know that.

137
00:09:54,177 --> 00:09:56,678
The lips.

138
00:09:56,679 --> 00:10:01,058
The breath.

139
00:10:01,059 --> 00:10:07,022
Eyes.

140
00:10:07,023 --> 00:10:10,859
Close.

141
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:14,196
Open.

142
00:10:14,197 --> 00:10:20,077
Death is the still water...

143
00:10:20,078 --> 00:10:23,747
At the door.

144
00:10:23,748 --> 00:10:25,708
I see you, death!

145
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:36,719
I... see... you!

146
00:10:43,601 --> 00:10:45,562
You want another glass?

147
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:57,489
Yeah. Sure.

148
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:59,408
What is that?

149
00:10:59,409 --> 00:11:02,828
Uh, it's this play i'm
working on for my class.

150
00:11:02,829 --> 00:11:03,954
What class?

151
00:11:03,955 --> 00:11:05,914
Acting class.

152
00:11:05,915 --> 00:11:07,416
Oh, what? You're an actor
now?

153
00:11:07,417 --> 00:11:11,587
The whole law thing just didn't
work out for you?

154
00:11:11,588 --> 00:11:14,256
Yeah.

155
00:11:14,257 --> 00:11:17,050
No, I have no idea what i'm
doing, actually.

156
00:11:17,051 --> 00:11:18,719
Look, I'm off in 20 minutes.

157
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:19,304
Let's...

158
00:11:19,305 --> 00:11:22,598
have a drink.

159
00:11:22,599 --> 00:11:24,559
Okay.

160
00:11:28,313 --> 00:11:29,646
Muchos gracias, señor.

161
00:11:29,647 --> 00:11:31,608
Thank you very much.

162
00:11:36,195 --> 00:11:37,446
Hi, Henry.

163
00:11:37,447 --> 00:11:38,197
Hi.

164
00:11:38,198 --> 00:11:40,532
So, what do you think?

165
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:42,075
Really quite something.

166
00:11:42,076 --> 00:11:43,452
Don't give me that.

167
00:11:43,453 --> 00:11:45,078
We thought it was great.

168
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:46,330
Tell me honestly.

169
00:11:46,331 --> 00:11:47,290
I can take it.

170
00:11:47,291 --> 00:11:48,749
No, you can't, Henry.

171
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:50,417
You never could.

172
00:11:50,418 --> 00:11:52,085
How dare you?

173
00:11:52,086 --> 00:11:53,462
It was...

174
00:11:53,463 --> 00:11:54,422
A bit self-indulgent.

175
00:11:54,422 --> 00:11:55,256
Self-indulgent?

176
00:11:55,256 --> 00:11:55,757
Yeah.

177
00:11:55,757 --> 00:11:56,633
Well, thank you.

178
00:11:56,634 --> 00:11:58,425
That really means a lot coming
from you.

179
00:11:58,426 --> 00:12:00,636
After all, that is your area of
expertise, isn't it?

180
00:12:00,637 --> 00:12:01,554
See? I told you?

181
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:02,180
It's okay.

182
00:12:02,181 --> 00:12:03,221
He couldn't take it.

183
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:04,932
Why'd you even bother coming?

184
00:12:04,933 --> 00:12:10,270
You asked me to, hen.

185
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:12,230
You asked me to.

186
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:13,899
What do you expect me to say?

187
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:16,652
It was a three-hour one-man show
without an intermission.

188
00:12:16,653 --> 00:12:17,903
It's barely over two.

189
00:12:17,904 --> 00:12:20,781
A man needs to get up and
stretch, especially after those

190
00:12:20,782 --> 00:12:21,908
cramped, little seats.

191
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:25,118
Well, not everyone can debut
their play on Broadway, you

192
00:12:25,119 --> 00:12:25,536
know.

193
00:12:25,537 --> 00:12:27,454
I'm sorry.

194
00:12:27,455 --> 00:12:28,331
I knew it.

195
00:12:28,332 --> 00:12:29,373
Knew what?

196
00:12:29,374 --> 00:12:33,335
That you'd complain about the
theater, about the lack of

197
00:12:33,336 --> 00:12:34,170
grandeur.

198
00:12:34,171 --> 00:12:38,173
Look, let's not go into this
right now, okay?

199
00:12:38,174 --> 00:12:40,050
It's a lovely evening.

200
00:12:40,051 --> 00:12:41,718
I want to enjoy it.

201
00:12:41,719 --> 00:12:45,597
I've got Veronica all dressed
up, and I want to show her off a

202
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:46,765
little bit, huh?

203
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:49,226
Fine.

204
00:12:49,227 --> 00:12:52,312
He's proud of you.

205
00:12:52,313 --> 00:13:00,313
Enjoy the rest of your evening.

206
00:13:00,863 --> 00:13:04,032
Seriously, this quarter-life
crisis seems a little more

207
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:06,410
dramatic than most.

208
00:13:06,411 --> 00:13:09,955
I don't want to be a lawyer
anymore.

209
00:13:09,956 --> 00:13:13,792
Why does everyone have such a
huge problem with that one?

210
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:15,335
It's my life.

211
00:13:15,336 --> 00:13:17,004
I'm living it.

212
00:13:17,005 --> 00:13:20,550
If I'm not doing what makes me
happy, then what's the point?

213
00:13:21,175 --> 00:13:25,846
You don't really seem that happy
to me.

214
00:13:25,847 --> 00:13:28,265
So, okay, so tell me about this
acting thing.

215
00:13:28,266 --> 00:13:30,142
Like, what is it you're drawn
to?

216
00:13:30,143 --> 00:13:33,311
'Cause if you're gonna pursue
this, then you should really go

217
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:34,438
whole hog, you know?

218
00:13:34,439 --> 00:13:35,731
Who says "whole hog"?

219
00:13:35,732 --> 00:13:36,815
Shut up.

220
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:39,568
I know.

221
00:13:39,569 --> 00:13:42,904
It's this roadblock, and I can't
tap into it.

222
00:13:42,905 --> 00:13:45,741
If I can't connect to this one
character, then how can I

223
00:13:45,742 --> 00:13:47,075
connect to any other one?

224
00:13:47,076 --> 00:13:50,078
I don't get it.

225
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:52,748
Maybe I should go to Spain.

226
00:13:52,749 --> 00:13:57,252
What?
I'm so confused.

227
00:13:57,253 --> 00:13:58,462
Go learn Victor.

228
00:13:58,463 --> 00:13:59,880
You're really drunk.

229
00:13:59,881 --> 00:14:02,632
This play, the one I was telling

230
00:14:02,633 --> 00:14:04,302
you about, it's set in Spain.

231
00:14:04,927 --> 00:14:06,386
I've never been there.

232
00:14:06,387 --> 00:14:10,640
How can one understand the
experience of Spain if one has

233
00:14:10,641 --> 00:14:12,017
never been there?

234
00:14:12,018 --> 00:14:15,270
Brit's gone.

235
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:18,398
This place is really awful
without her.

236
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:20,108
Go to Spain, then.

237
00:14:20,109 --> 00:14:21,526
Maybe they have hogs there.

238
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:25,322
You're so weird.

239
00:14:25,323 --> 00:14:30,160
Think I'm going to bed.

240
00:14:30,161 --> 00:14:32,287
All right, don't be an asshole.

241
00:14:32,288 --> 00:14:33,081
Go make up.

242
00:14:33,082 --> 00:14:38,710
You're a peach, you know that?

243
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:42,214
I try.

244
00:14:42,215 --> 00:14:46,176
To peaches.

245
00:14:46,177 --> 00:14:47,177
To peaches.

246
00:14:47,178 --> 00:14:48,178
Like you.

247
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:24,589
You okay?

248
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:30,137
I just don't know why it went
wrong there.

249
00:15:30,138 --> 00:15:33,765
There's a point in life where
the problems of the son are no

250
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:36,143
longer the fault of the father.

251
00:15:36,144 --> 00:15:37,853
Some answers.

252
00:15:37,854 --> 00:15:39,396
Nope.

253
00:15:39,397 --> 00:15:41,398
Veronica.

254
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:46,194
I was wondering, what am I

255
00:15:46,195 --> 00:15:47,029
doing?

256
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:48,822
Why am I here?

257
00:15:48,823 --> 00:15:54,077
Why am I learning all of this
stuff and giving all of these

258
00:15:54,078 --> 00:15:59,249
feelings every minute, every
day, every hour, every month,

259
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:00,500
every week?

260
00:16:00,501 --> 00:16:02,961
Why am I doing all of this?

261
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:04,671
For what? For this?

262
00:16:04,672 --> 00:16:07,257
For a 30-second cola commercial?

263
00:16:07,258 --> 00:16:13,930
And I realized I needed to
reexamine everything in my life.

264
00:16:13,931 --> 00:16:15,807
Everything.

265
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:20,395
And I knew that I was doing
this, I was learning all of this

266
00:16:20,396 --> 00:16:23,356
and I was doing all of this

267
00:16:23,357 --> 00:16:27,694
because I had to.
Had.

268
00:16:27,695 --> 00:16:30,697
Had to.

269
00:16:30,698 --> 00:16:38,698
There was something inside of
me...

270
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:52,886
Me.

271
00:16:52,887 --> 00:16:54,971
Me.

272
00:16:54,972 --> 00:16:58,934
that had to be explored.

273
00:16:58,935 --> 00:17:04,146
I had to know my truth.

274
00:17:04,147 --> 00:17:10,069
And acting had become my truth.

275
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:14,491
So I can't tell you what to do
or how to do it.

276
00:17:14,492 --> 00:17:22,289
I can only tell you that you
must find this for yourself.

277
00:17:22,290 --> 00:17:29,089
You must, must, must, must find
your truth.

278
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:32,968
There's only one. It's yours.

279
00:17:32,969 --> 00:17:36,471
Okay. It's true.

280
00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:38,515
So, who's my next victim?

281
00:17:38,516 --> 00:17:40,726
Oh, good.

282
00:18:18,514 --> 00:18:20,807
La amar.

283
00:18:20,808 --> 00:18:25,186
La amar estaba Serena.

284
00:18:25,187 --> 00:18:28,231
Serena estaba la amar.

285
00:18:28,232 --> 00:18:31,776
If she could sleep underwater,
she would, because then she

286
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:34,946
would never have to leave the
sea.

287
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:39,034
"My home," she said.

288
00:18:39,035 --> 00:18:46,207
Sand on skin and sun-stained
eyelashes, her brown arms

289
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:50,545
wrapped around me, entangle me.

290
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:52,506
What languages did you study

291
00:19:01,599 --> 00:19:02,558
In school?

292
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:03,517
German.

293
00:19:03,518 --> 00:19:04,726
Aha. I see.

294
00:19:04,727 --> 00:19:06,353
No romance languages.

295
00:19:06,354 --> 00:19:07,104
Why?

296
00:19:07,105 --> 00:19:09,397
La amar.

297
00:19:09,398 --> 00:19:10,398
Say it with me.

298
00:19:10,399 --> 00:19:11,775
Feel it on your tongue.

299
00:19:11,776 --> 00:19:12,443
La amar.

300
00:19:12,444 --> 00:19:13,526
La amar. La amar.

301
00:19:13,527 --> 00:19:14,236
La amar.

302
00:19:14,237 --> 00:19:15,278
La... la amard.

303
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:16,905
I mean, there's a difference.

304
00:19:16,906 --> 00:19:17,823
Can you hear it?

305
00:19:17,824 --> 00:19:20,325
Lamare. La amar.

306
00:19:20,326 --> 00:19:21,534
Right?

307
00:19:21,535 --> 00:19:26,289
You can't say these lines kind
of like an indifferent American.

308
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:30,877
You have to say them like you
know them, like they're yours.

309
00:19:30,878 --> 00:19:34,047
La amar.

310
00:19:34,048 --> 00:19:34,965
La amar.

311
00:19:34,965 --> 00:19:35,758
La amar.

312
00:19:35,759 --> 00:19:37,842
La amar. La amar.

313
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:40,136
Okay, practice it. Just...

314
00:19:40,137 --> 00:19:43,431
La amar. La amar. La amar.

315
00:19:43,432 --> 00:19:45,600
Practice it.

316
00:19:45,601 --> 00:19:49,521
I bought my ticket.

317
00:19:49,522 --> 00:19:52,941
What?
I'm going to Spain on

318
00:19:52,942 --> 00:19:53,776
Tuesday.

319
00:19:53,777 --> 00:19:55,944
You surprise me.

320
00:19:55,945 --> 00:19:56,695
Yeah?

321
00:19:56,696 --> 00:20:01,449
I think that you'll, um, open
yourself up.

322
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:09,450
And then when you come back, we
can maybe conquer Victor.

323
00:20:10,668 --> 00:20:12,252
Do you want me to continue?

324
00:20:12,253 --> 00:20:13,628
Ah, yeah.

325
00:20:13,629 --> 00:20:15,880
No, no, no. No, no, no.

326
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:18,007
Take it from the top.

327
00:20:18,008 --> 00:20:20,594
And this time, hit your "r."

328
00:21:37,421 --> 00:21:40,632
The heat, frozen hot.

329
00:21:40,633 --> 00:21:43,384
The "tomah-toes" are sliced.

330
00:21:43,385 --> 00:21:46,095
The "tomay-toes."

331
00:21:46,096 --> 00:21:48,598
I never tried to.

332
00:21:48,599 --> 00:21:51,185
I never even tried.

333
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:58,441
What?

334
00:21:58,442 --> 00:22:00,652
The tomatoes.

335
00:22:00,653 --> 00:22:04,280
Yeah?

336
00:22:04,281 --> 00:22:06,324
Nothing.

337
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:09,953
It's, um, you know, it's just

338
00:22:09,954 --> 00:22:10,829
asides.

339
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:14,499
Just... just say them.

340
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:16,709
It'll... it'll all make more
sense when you read the whole

341
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:18,795
play.

342
00:22:18,796 --> 00:22:21,589
The whole play?

343
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:23,841
Rather large.

344
00:22:23,842 --> 00:22:25,803
Okay, good. Thanks, guys.

345
00:22:30,516 --> 00:22:33,768
I think that's all I need to see
for... for now, so thanks very

346
00:22:33,769 --> 00:22:35,061
much.

347
00:22:35,062 --> 00:22:38,856
Thanks.
Um, so, who's next?

348
00:22:38,857 --> 00:22:39,899
Um...

349
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:41,734
Ana. Ana?

350
00:22:41,735 --> 00:22:45,321
Sí. Yo.

351
00:22:45,322 --> 00:22:47,283
And Roberto.

352
00:22:50,452 --> 00:22:51,578
Roberto?

353
00:22:51,579 --> 00:22:53,162
That's me.

354
00:22:53,163 --> 00:22:57,959
Okay.

355
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:05,960
So, can we go from the top,
please?

356
00:23:06,343 --> 00:23:07,844
When you're ready.

357
00:23:07,845 --> 00:23:09,262
Okay.

358
00:23:09,263 --> 00:23:12,765
Do you think the world gets
small at night?

359
00:23:12,766 --> 00:23:16,311
Do you think the lights in my
room are real?

360
00:23:16,312 --> 00:23:18,146
I ache before waking.

361
00:23:18,147 --> 00:23:21,107
I fear the morning to losing
you.

362
00:23:21,108 --> 00:23:27,530
My dreams, only if they
continue, light beyond light.

363
00:23:27,531 --> 00:23:30,492
The heat, frozen hot.

364
00:24:43,732 --> 00:24:46,527
Oh, señor lucchesi.

365
00:25:02,543 --> 00:25:03,626
Hola, Francis.

366
00:25:03,627 --> 00:25:04,752
How's it going?

367
00:25:04,753 --> 00:25:07,380
Oh, just picking something up
for the little lady.

368
00:25:07,381 --> 00:25:09,590
Oh, did she like the books of
monologues?

369
00:25:09,591 --> 00:25:10,300
She did.

370
00:25:10,301 --> 00:25:12,802
She's been channeling
Elizabeth Taylor all over the

371
00:25:12,803 --> 00:25:13,928
living room for days.

372
00:25:13,929 --> 00:25:14,638
Oh, good.

373
00:25:14,639 --> 00:25:16,055
"Cat on a hot tin roof," huh?

374
00:25:16,056 --> 00:25:18,558
All the actors seem to go
through that these days.

375
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:19,600
Ah, yes, indeed.

376
00:25:19,601 --> 00:25:23,438
Did you happen to get a copy of
that, uh, splinters play in yet?

377
00:25:23,439 --> 00:25:25,023
Oh, no. Not yet. Sorry.

378
00:25:26,233 --> 00:25:27,692
Maybe next time.

379
00:25:27,693 --> 00:25:29,653
Sure. Have a nice day.

380
00:26:27,878 --> 00:26:30,963
May I ask you something?

381
00:26:30,964 --> 00:26:32,799
Yeah.

382
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:35,426
How long do you intend to
follow me?

383
00:26:35,427 --> 00:26:38,429
Uh, I'm... do I know you?

384
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:40,556
No. No, you don't, sir.

385
00:26:40,557 --> 00:26:44,435
Well, um, care for a drink?

386
00:26:44,436 --> 00:26:47,188
Don't just stand there with your
mouth open, kid.

387
00:26:47,189 --> 00:26:48,815
This way.

388
00:26:48,816 --> 00:26:50,776
So, what do they call you?

389
00:27:04,289 --> 00:27:05,623
James.

390
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:07,959
My name's, uh, Carl. Proper.

391
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:10,419
Around here, they all call me
Carlo.

392
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:13,756
It's an honor to meet you, sir.

393
00:27:13,757 --> 00:27:14,757
You okay, kid?

394
00:27:14,758 --> 00:27:16,050
You look a little pale.

395
00:27:16,051 --> 00:27:18,719
It's just that, uh, do you
believe in fate?

396
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:23,683
I believe in the idea of
fate, uh, the hope of fate.

397
00:27:23,684 --> 00:27:28,229
I-I don't know if I believe in
fate itself.

398
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:30,815
Because your plays are what
brought me here.

399
00:27:30,816 --> 00:27:31,692
I see.

400
00:27:31,693 --> 00:27:33,067
You're a stalker.

401
00:27:33,068 --> 00:27:33,986
No, no.

402
00:27:33,987 --> 00:27:35,486
I swear, seriously.

403
00:27:35,487 --> 00:27:37,280
I can't believe my luck.

404
00:27:37,281 --> 00:27:40,700
So, you're a... you're a writer?

405
00:27:40,701 --> 00:27:42,660
No, I'm a lawyer.

406
00:27:42,661 --> 00:27:44,036
Uh, I was a lawyer.

407
00:27:44,037 --> 00:27:45,788
I'm an actor now, I guess.

408
00:27:45,789 --> 00:27:47,623
Let me get this straight.

409
00:27:47,624 --> 00:27:51,460
You... you were a lawyer, but
you gave that up to become an

410
00:27:51,461 --> 00:27:52,087
actor?

411
00:27:52,087 --> 00:27:52,838
Yeah.

412
00:27:52,839 --> 00:27:56,507
Well, I guess everyone needs
a fallback plan.

413
00:27:56,508 --> 00:27:58,175
True.

414
00:27:58,176 --> 00:28:00,678
I've wanted to be an actor since
I was a kid.

415
00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:04,724
I was just too afraid to admit
it to anyone else, too afraid to

416
00:28:04,725 --> 00:28:06,475
try.

417
00:28:06,476 --> 00:28:08,185
So I became a lawyer.

418
00:28:08,186 --> 00:28:10,521
And everyone was happy but me.

419
00:28:10,522 --> 00:28:13,482
Takes guts to do something
crazy.

420
00:28:13,483 --> 00:28:14,859
I know that one.

421
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:17,612
And now that I'm brave enough
to try acting, I'm realizing

422
00:28:17,613 --> 00:28:21,449
that I'm really an awful actor.

423
00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:24,285
I'm stuck. I...

424
00:28:24,286 --> 00:28:25,995
I can't connect to any
character.

425
00:28:25,996 --> 00:28:28,497
It's like...

426
00:28:28,498 --> 00:28:32,627
I see the words, but I don't
know how to make them real.

427
00:28:32,628 --> 00:28:35,463
So you came to Spain to make
them real?

428
00:28:35,464 --> 00:28:36,881
Make Victor real.

429
00:28:36,882 --> 00:28:37,882
Ah, I see.

430
00:28:37,883 --> 00:28:38,966
I see. Victor. Yeah.

431
00:28:38,967 --> 00:28:40,968
Yeah, I came in search of
Victor.

432
00:28:40,969 --> 00:28:43,220
Instead you found me.

433
00:28:43,221 --> 00:28:46,515
Which, in some ways, is
better, because maybe I can ask

434
00:28:46,516 --> 00:28:48,225
you what it all means.

435
00:28:48,226 --> 00:28:51,479
"A light exists in a corner

436
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:52,314
of a room.

437
00:28:52,315 --> 00:28:54,690
A small, yellow triangle of
light."

438
00:28:54,691 --> 00:28:56,150
Don't.

439
00:28:56,151 --> 00:28:58,486
Don't quote "tinto" to me,
please.

440
00:28:58,487 --> 00:28:59,363
Why not?

441
00:28:59,364 --> 00:29:03,115
Do you know how many mediocre
college performances of that

442
00:29:03,116 --> 00:29:05,409
play that I've had to sit
through?

443
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:10,164
How many soggy, washed up,
pathetic professors have sought

444
00:29:10,165 --> 00:29:14,919
me out over the years to... to
glean my secrets and how to

445
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:16,504
write "the play."

446
00:29:16,505 --> 00:29:21,175
Do you think I know?

447
00:29:21,176 --> 00:29:23,052
Who is she?

448
00:29:23,053 --> 00:29:24,261
What do you mean?

449
00:29:24,262 --> 00:29:26,305
The girl with the golden eyes.

450
00:29:26,306 --> 00:29:27,974
She's in every play you write.

451
00:29:27,975 --> 00:29:29,725
I mean, I've only read the old
ones.

452
00:29:29,726 --> 00:29:30,977
I haven't read the new ones.

453
00:29:30,978 --> 00:29:33,521
There are no new ones.

454
00:29:33,522 --> 00:29:37,316
Do you know what it's like to
have created your... your best

455
00:29:37,317 --> 00:29:44,073
work 30 years ago, how
paralyzing it is, how to know

456
00:29:44,074 --> 00:29:48,202
that you shouldn't even attempt
to try to write again 'cause

457
00:29:48,203 --> 00:29:49,453
there's no point?

458
00:29:49,454 --> 00:29:50,496
You've tried.

459
00:29:50,497 --> 00:29:52,957
You can't re-create it, any of
it.

460
00:29:52,958 --> 00:29:58,129
Do you think I could just tap
into it magically, you know?

461
00:29:58,130 --> 00:30:01,757
Re-create it instantly, like
that?

462
00:30:01,758 --> 00:30:04,760
Don't you think I've tried

463
00:30:04,761 --> 00:30:07,221
already?

464
00:30:07,222 --> 00:30:10,182
So don't you sit over there

465
00:30:10,183 --> 00:30:14,395
asking me about this elusive
mystery, this golden-eyed girl.

466
00:30:14,396 --> 00:30:19,275
Truth is, she doesn't exist.

467
00:30:19,276 --> 00:30:20,818
Never did.

468
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:26,115
I made her up, just like I made
up everything else.

469
00:30:26,116 --> 00:30:28,534
So, where you staying?

470
00:30:28,535 --> 00:30:30,244
Uh, some hotel I found.

471
00:30:30,245 --> 00:30:31,620
The adagio, I think.

472
00:30:31,621 --> 00:30:35,207
Look, we don't want you
staying in some old hotel when

473
00:30:35,208 --> 00:30:36,751
we have plenty of room.

474
00:30:36,752 --> 00:30:39,086
It's just down the road a piece.

475
00:30:39,087 --> 00:30:41,088
Come with me, have a drink.

476
00:30:41,089 --> 00:30:43,675
Veronica will like you, I think.

477
00:30:59,733 --> 00:31:01,693
Hola.

478
00:31:09,367 --> 00:31:10,493
What?

479
00:31:10,494 --> 00:31:12,328
Can I ask you something?

480
00:31:12,329 --> 00:31:15,456
Look...
If you don't understand the

481
00:31:15,457 --> 00:31:17,291
lines, I don't really want to
hear it.

482
00:31:17,292 --> 00:31:18,709
It's... it's all in the script.

483
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:21,295
It all makes sense if you read
the script.

484
00:31:21,296 --> 00:31:22,546
No.

485
00:31:22,547 --> 00:31:26,300
I was thinking that if you need
help with costumes, I like to do

486
00:31:26,301 --> 00:31:27,301
that.

487
00:31:32,182 --> 00:31:32,974
Ooh.

488
00:31:32,975 --> 00:31:36,185
I-I didn't want to seem...

489
00:31:36,186 --> 00:31:40,314
I mean, I will still offer to do
the costumes even if I don't get

490
00:31:40,315 --> 00:31:41,108
the role.

491
00:31:41,109 --> 00:31:43,068
Okay.

492
00:31:48,073 --> 00:31:49,615
Ana.

493
00:31:49,616 --> 00:31:51,575
It's Ana, no?

494
00:31:51,576 --> 00:31:52,785
Sí.

495
00:31:52,786 --> 00:31:55,955
What did you have in mind?

496
00:31:55,956 --> 00:32:02,128
I may need to read the script
first.

497
00:32:02,129 --> 00:32:03,462
The whole thing?

498
00:32:03,463 --> 00:32:04,755
The whole thing.

499
00:32:04,756 --> 00:32:09,593
May I invite you for a drink?

500
00:32:09,594 --> 00:32:12,513
It seems you need one.

501
00:32:12,514 --> 00:32:14,140
Yeah.

502
00:32:14,141 --> 00:32:15,850
Okay. Let's go.

503
00:32:15,851 --> 00:32:17,811
Okay.

504
00:32:26,361 --> 00:32:27,695
Just down the road, eh?

505
00:32:27,696 --> 00:32:29,780
So I lied a little bit.

506
00:32:29,781 --> 00:32:32,283
Not a bad drive, though, huh?

507
00:32:32,284 --> 00:32:34,244
Not a bad drive at all.

508
00:32:40,083 --> 00:32:41,667
Veronica!

509
00:32:41,668 --> 00:32:43,628
Veronica!

510
00:32:52,304 --> 00:32:54,264
I picked up a wandering

511
00:32:59,436 --> 00:33:00,270
Minstrel.

512
00:33:00,271 --> 00:33:01,271
So I see.

513
00:33:01,272 --> 00:33:03,440
This is James of California.

514
00:33:04,107 --> 00:33:06,942
Nice to meet you, James of
California.

515
00:33:06,943 --> 00:33:09,654
Mucho gusto.

516
00:33:10,155 --> 00:33:12,531
Not that I can tell.

517
00:33:12,532 --> 00:33:15,117
Nice place.

518
00:33:15,118 --> 00:33:17,494
I didn't have much to do with
it.

519
00:33:17,495 --> 00:33:19,538
So, uh, what do you feel like
drinking?

520
00:33:19,539 --> 00:33:20,831
I'm game for anything.

521
00:33:20,832 --> 00:33:23,834
I have rehearsals tonight, so
I should probably get going.

522
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:25,211
Nice to meet you.

523
00:33:25,212 --> 00:33:26,420
See you later.

524
00:33:26,421 --> 00:33:27,214
Sure.

525
00:33:27,215 --> 00:33:28,839
Good.

526
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:29,341
Ciao.

527
00:33:29,342 --> 00:33:30,716
Do you like vodka?

528
00:33:30,717 --> 00:33:33,177
Sure. Why not?

529
00:33:33,178 --> 00:33:34,637
Ah. Let's see now.

530
00:33:34,638 --> 00:33:36,598
Do we have any limes?

531
00:33:41,811 --> 00:33:43,520
Your daughter's very beautiful.

532
00:33:43,521 --> 00:33:46,732
What?

533
00:33:46,733 --> 00:33:48,652
She ain't my daughter.

534
00:33:49,361 --> 00:33:50,694
Yeah, I know.

535
00:33:50,695 --> 00:33:52,279
She's quite a catch.

536
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:56,909
The thing is, uh, she caught me.

537
00:33:56,910 --> 00:33:59,703
Um, I'm sorry. I mean...

538
00:33:59,704 --> 00:34:00,871
Don't worry.

539
00:34:00,872 --> 00:34:03,123
To your health.

540
00:34:03,124 --> 00:34:11,124
To my health.
To fate.

541
00:35:04,853 --> 00:35:08,063
Carlo!

542
00:35:08,064 --> 00:35:09,648
Carlo!

543
00:35:09,649 --> 00:35:14,820
Hi.

544
00:35:14,821 --> 00:35:15,739
Hi.

545
00:35:15,740 --> 00:35:19,325
Hey.

546
00:35:19,326 --> 00:35:22,786
Hey.

547
00:35:22,787 --> 00:35:24,163
Carlo.

548
00:35:24,164 --> 00:35:27,416
To bed?

549
00:35:27,417 --> 00:35:30,127
To bed? It's early, darling.

550
00:35:30,128 --> 00:35:32,504
Let me help you to bed.

551
00:35:32,505 --> 00:35:33,465
No, no, no.

552
00:35:33,466 --> 00:35:34,506
Let me help you.

553
00:35:34,507 --> 00:35:38,469
Come up.

554
00:35:38,470 --> 00:35:43,850
Wait, wait.

555
00:35:47,729 --> 00:35:50,314
Oh, my gosh.

556
00:35:50,315 --> 00:35:54,818
Good night, my boy.

557
00:35:54,819 --> 00:35:57,821
Veronica, can you help me up...
Up the stairs?

558
00:35:57,822 --> 00:35:58,656
Sí. Sí.

559
00:35:58,657 --> 00:36:00,199
Thanks.

560
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:04,204
Oh, my god.

561
00:36:07,749 --> 00:36:09,709
Wow.

562
00:36:20,470 --> 00:36:22,638
Wow.

563
00:36:22,639 --> 00:36:30,229
So, you're an actress?

564
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:31,230
And you?

565
00:36:31,231 --> 00:36:32,940
Are you an actor, too?

566
00:36:32,941 --> 00:36:37,778
Uh, I'm pretending to be an

567
00:36:37,779 --> 00:36:40,447
actor, but...

568
00:36:40,448 --> 00:36:41,990
Who knows?

569
00:36:41,991 --> 00:36:45,828
How do you know Carlo?

570
00:36:45,829 --> 00:36:46,954
I don't.

571
00:36:46,955 --> 00:36:47,831
What?

572
00:36:47,832 --> 00:36:50,958
Oh, we just met this
afternoon, uh, at the theater

573
00:36:50,959 --> 00:36:51,959
book store.

574
00:36:53,962 --> 00:36:56,755
And he brought you home?

575
00:36:56,756 --> 00:36:58,132
Wow.

576
00:36:58,133 --> 00:36:59,758
He must like you.

577
00:36:59,759 --> 00:37:02,302
Tell me, James.

578
00:37:02,303 --> 00:37:04,263
What brings you to Spain?

579
00:37:04,264 --> 00:37:05,848
Your husband's plays.

580
00:37:05,849 --> 00:37:06,641
Oh, no.

581
00:37:06,642 --> 00:37:08,017
He's not my husband.

582
00:37:08,601 --> 00:37:14,022
That is not my choice, you know?

583
00:37:14,023 --> 00:37:16,692
What have you boys been doing
this evening?

584
00:37:16,693 --> 00:37:18,653
He's a lucky man.

585
00:37:26,035 --> 00:37:27,411
No.

586
00:37:27,412 --> 00:37:31,957
I am the lucky one.

587
00:37:31,958 --> 00:37:34,626
Are you always this bold?

588
00:37:34,627 --> 00:37:36,588
You are quite stunning.

589
00:37:40,675 --> 00:37:41,884
Why are you here?

590
00:37:41,885 --> 00:37:45,304
To figure out what this is
all about.

591
00:37:45,305 --> 00:37:50,267
This magical life in Spain that
inspired your hu...

592
00:37:50,268 --> 00:37:55,606
This life that inspired him to
write so many amazing plays.

593
00:37:55,607 --> 00:37:57,024
And the women, too.

594
00:37:57,025 --> 00:37:58,859
The women who inspired it.

595
00:37:58,860 --> 00:38:02,112
Well, he's never written
anything about me.

596
00:38:02,113 --> 00:38:06,366
So there's no need to get to
know me better for that reason.

597
00:38:06,367 --> 00:38:07,826
Why not?

598
00:38:07,827 --> 00:38:10,288
Why wouldn't he write about you?

599
00:38:11,915 --> 00:38:13,457
I don't know.

600
00:38:13,458 --> 00:38:16,335
You snagged yourself a good
one, didn't you?

601
00:38:16,336 --> 00:38:23,592
This house is spectacular.

602
00:38:23,593 --> 00:38:25,427
How dare you say that?

603
00:38:25,428 --> 00:38:27,596
I didn't mean to offend you.

604
00:38:27,597 --> 00:38:30,599
Well, you have offended me
very much.

605
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:31,934
This is my house.

606
00:38:31,935 --> 00:38:33,936
It was my grandfather's.

607
00:38:33,937 --> 00:38:36,897
I inherited it when my father
died.

608
00:38:36,898 --> 00:38:37,898
I see you.

609
00:38:37,899 --> 00:38:40,025
I see what you're thinking.

610
00:38:40,026 --> 00:38:44,363
And how dare you judge me or
judge him?

611
00:38:44,364 --> 00:38:46,949
He had nothing when I met him.

612
00:38:46,950 --> 00:38:48,575
His plays were all successful.

613
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:49,410
That is true.

614
00:38:49,411 --> 00:38:52,287
But any money he had back then
all went to Katherine.

615
00:38:52,288 --> 00:38:54,873
And when they split, she got
almost everything.

616
00:38:54,874 --> 00:38:57,834
So don't you think for one
minute that I am with him in

617
00:38:57,835 --> 00:38:59,962
some kind of like... what do you
say?

618
00:38:59,963 --> 00:39:02,297
A gold digger?

619
00:39:02,298 --> 00:39:04,633
I love him.

620
00:39:04,634 --> 00:39:08,011
I don't know why I always have
to defend that point.

621
00:39:08,012 --> 00:39:09,471
I'm sorry, really.

622
00:39:09,472 --> 00:39:10,514
No, listen.

623
00:39:10,515 --> 00:39:13,684
I love him. I pursued him.

624
00:39:13,685 --> 00:39:17,020
He sees the world in such a
magical way.

625
00:39:17,021 --> 00:39:19,439
I just love being close to him.

626
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:23,193
He makes me feel alive like no
one ever had.

627
00:39:23,194 --> 00:39:24,361
I think I'm going to bed.

628
00:39:24,362 --> 00:39:26,196
Look, I can leave if you want
me to.

629
00:39:26,197 --> 00:39:28,198
No! No.

630
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:31,034
He wants you to stay, so you
should stay.

631
00:39:31,035 --> 00:39:34,162
I want him happy.

632
00:39:34,163 --> 00:39:36,665
Your... your room is upstairs.

633
00:39:36,666 --> 00:39:38,626
Good night.

634
00:41:40,164 --> 00:41:42,125
Morning to you.

635
00:42:02,395 --> 00:42:04,479
Coffee.

636
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:06,523
Thank you.

637
00:42:06,524 --> 00:42:09,025
You're welcome.

638
00:42:09,026 --> 00:42:10,987
Look, um...

639
00:42:14,866 --> 00:42:17,200
I think I was a bit drunk last
night.

640
00:42:17,201 --> 00:42:22,330
So, you didn't mean it when
you asked me to marry you?

641
00:42:22,331 --> 00:42:24,416
What?

642
00:42:24,417 --> 00:42:26,669
Right after you serenaded me.

643
00:42:30,590 --> 00:42:35,469
I'm sorry.

644
00:42:35,470 --> 00:42:38,264
I said yes, by the way.

645
00:45:32,605 --> 00:45:37,275
Whoo!

646
00:45:37,276 --> 00:45:43,406
We're gonna be heading out.

647
00:45:43,407 --> 00:45:45,408
You think you can find your way
back?

648
00:45:45,409 --> 00:45:46,910
Yeah, I'll be okay. Thanks.

649
00:45:46,911 --> 00:45:48,788
Okay.

650
00:46:02,385 --> 00:46:04,553
You sure you won't be bored?

651
00:46:32,748 --> 00:46:36,292
Hi.

652
00:46:36,293 --> 00:46:39,504
I want you back, brit.

653
00:46:39,505 --> 00:46:42,173
And I want you to...

654
00:46:42,174 --> 00:46:43,134
Be in my life.

655
00:46:43,135 --> 00:46:44,301
I miss you so much.

656
00:48:17,603 --> 00:48:20,063
I see she has seduced you, eh?

657
00:48:20,064 --> 00:48:22,899
When'd you return?

658
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:25,693
Late.

659
00:48:25,694 --> 00:48:26,694
I don't even know.

660
00:48:26,695 --> 00:48:28,113
I walked around for hours.

661
00:48:28,114 --> 00:48:29,114
You look awful.

662
00:48:29,115 --> 00:48:33,618
I feel awful.

663
00:48:33,619 --> 00:48:37,705
I called brit.

664
00:48:37,706 --> 00:48:39,916
Ah, la californiana.

665
00:48:39,917 --> 00:48:40,751
Sí.

666
00:48:40,752 --> 00:48:42,418
And?

667
00:48:42,419 --> 00:48:45,505
I miss her.

668
00:48:45,506 --> 00:48:48,466
I really miss her.

669
00:48:48,467 --> 00:48:52,428
So she didn't take you back
with a phone call, huh?

670
00:48:52,429 --> 00:48:54,430
What'd you expect?

671
00:48:54,431 --> 00:48:57,308
You know who she is, don't you,
son?

672
00:48:57,309 --> 00:48:58,060
Who?

673
00:48:58,061 --> 00:49:03,690
The one you let get away.

674
00:49:03,691 --> 00:49:05,942
What do I do?

675
00:49:05,943 --> 00:49:08,194
Well, you have a couple of
choices, kid.

676
00:49:08,195 --> 00:49:13,158
Uh, you can do as I did and
pathetically write about it for

677
00:49:13,159 --> 00:49:15,160
40 years.

678
00:49:15,161 --> 00:49:17,120
Or "b"...

679
00:49:17,121 --> 00:49:19,038
What's "b"?

680
00:49:19,039 --> 00:49:20,957
Get the hell out of here.

681
00:49:20,958 --> 00:49:22,959
Go on. Find her. Be with her.

682
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:23,919
Fight for her.

683
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:27,297
Don't... don't waste your life
away wishing you'd been this

684
00:49:27,298 --> 00:49:29,340
courageous youth.

685
00:49:29,341 --> 00:49:35,054
It's not a fun choice to look
back on from this end of things.

686
00:49:35,055 --> 00:49:37,599
I thought you said you made
that up.

687
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:38,725
Made what up?

688
00:49:38,726 --> 00:49:41,352
The girl with the golden eyes.

689
00:49:41,353 --> 00:49:42,271
I lied.

690
00:49:42,271 --> 00:49:43,189
I thought so.

691
00:49:43,190 --> 00:49:46,858
Look, what's the point now, huh?

692
00:49:46,859 --> 00:49:51,738
I have the most beautiful woman
in the world on my arm.

693
00:49:51,739 --> 00:49:53,948
I have no complaints.

694
00:49:53,949 --> 00:49:56,034
Regrets, maybe, but...

695
00:49:56,035 --> 00:49:57,995
No complaints.

696
00:50:01,081 --> 00:50:04,083
Tomorrow night, there's a
show I want to check out.

697
00:50:04,084 --> 00:50:05,168
Care to join?

698
00:50:05,169 --> 00:50:06,753
What kind of show?

699
00:50:06,754 --> 00:50:09,881
Just music. Live music.

700
00:50:09,882 --> 00:50:10,716
Perhaps.

701
00:50:10,717 --> 00:50:12,926
But right now, I feel like a
swim.

702
00:50:12,927 --> 00:50:13,886
How about you?

703
00:50:13,887 --> 00:50:15,304
Sure.

704
00:50:23,687 --> 00:50:28,733
Stop, stop.

705
00:50:28,734 --> 00:50:30,026
It's cold.

706
00:50:30,027 --> 00:50:31,986
Good.

707
00:50:31,987 --> 00:50:34,405
I know, but...

708
00:50:34,406 --> 00:50:36,407
When... no, no, no.

709
00:50:36,408 --> 00:50:39,369
Don't worry.

710
00:50:39,370 --> 00:50:45,625
Wait. No.

711
00:50:45,626 --> 00:50:48,544
Can't see.

712
00:50:48,545 --> 00:50:49,712
Dad?

713
00:50:49,713 --> 00:50:50,547
Henry.

714
00:50:50,548 --> 00:50:51,589
You okay?

715
00:50:51,590 --> 00:50:53,132
Yeah.

716
00:50:53,133 --> 00:50:55,802
I'm fine, thanks.

717
00:50:55,803 --> 00:50:58,596
You so rarely call.

718
00:50:58,597 --> 00:51:00,390
I thought something was wrong.

719
00:51:00,391 --> 00:51:02,392
Yeah, I know. Hen. I...

720
00:51:02,393 --> 00:51:03,518
I'm sorry about that.

721
00:51:03,519 --> 00:51:04,894
I need to call more often.

722
00:51:04,895 --> 00:51:07,313
I really do. Yeah.

723
00:51:07,314 --> 00:51:08,982
So should I, I suppose.

724
00:51:08,983 --> 00:51:12,819
But, Henry, uh, there's this
live music I'm going to with a

725
00:51:12,820 --> 00:51:14,737
friend of mine from California.

726
00:51:14,738 --> 00:51:18,741
And I was wondering if you
would, uh, like to join us, you

727
00:51:18,742 --> 00:51:21,411
know, just us guys hitting the
town.

728
00:51:21,412 --> 00:51:23,121
We'd like that.

729
00:51:23,122 --> 00:51:24,497
All right.

730
00:51:24,498 --> 00:51:25,249
When?

731
00:51:25,250 --> 00:51:27,792
Tomorrow. Tomorrow night.

732
00:51:27,793 --> 00:51:30,712
Can you make it?

733
00:51:30,713 --> 00:51:32,672
Tomorrow, yeah.

734
00:51:32,673 --> 00:51:35,133
Yeah, I can do tomorrow.

735
00:51:35,134 --> 00:51:38,511
I-I might bring somebody along,
if that's okay.

736
00:51:38,512 --> 00:51:41,431
Oh, great.
Sure. Whoever.

737
00:51:41,432 --> 00:51:42,807
Bring him along.

738
00:51:42,808 --> 00:51:44,058
It'd be great.

739
00:51:44,059 --> 00:51:47,061
It's a she, actually.

740
00:51:47,062 --> 00:51:48,479
Oh. Oh, yeah.

741
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:49,897
Certainly. Yeah.

742
00:51:49,898 --> 00:51:54,402
Well, look, uh, in that case,
uh, why don't you come by the

743
00:51:54,403 --> 00:51:54,987
house?

744
00:51:54,987 --> 00:51:55,821
Come on by.

745
00:51:55,822 --> 00:51:57,280
We'll have some drinks.

746
00:51:57,281 --> 00:51:59,824
Veronica would love to see you.

747
00:51:59,825 --> 00:52:01,576
Okay. See you tomorrow, then.

748
00:52:01,577 --> 00:52:04,495
See you then.

749
00:52:04,496 --> 00:52:06,457
What?

750
00:53:45,889 --> 00:53:48,933
So, hen, how's your new play
coming along?

751
00:53:48,934 --> 00:53:51,936
It's going well, I think.

752
00:53:51,937 --> 00:53:54,689
Ana's costumes are gonna be
amazing.

753
00:53:54,690 --> 00:53:57,359
Really bring everything to life.

754
00:53:59,528 --> 00:54:02,363
Only thing is, I don't
actually have a lead.

755
00:54:02,364 --> 00:54:05,700
The woman I cast has, uh, has
just backed down, which is

756
00:54:05,701 --> 00:54:07,076
probably for the best.

757
00:54:07,077 --> 00:54:10,955
She wasn't really right for the
part anyways.

758
00:54:10,956 --> 00:54:13,624
It's hard to find
English-speaking actresses here

759
00:54:13,625 --> 00:54:17,795
in Barcelona that really
understand the intricacies of

760
00:54:17,796 --> 00:54:21,132
the language.

761
00:54:21,133 --> 00:54:25,887
Should have done what you said
years ago and moved to New York.

762
00:54:25,888 --> 00:54:29,056
But I love my life here.

763
00:54:29,057 --> 00:54:30,975
Especially now.

764
00:54:30,976 --> 00:54:32,643
Good to see.

765
00:54:32,644 --> 00:54:34,688
Really good to see.

766
00:54:38,358 --> 00:54:38,942
Sí.

767
00:54:38,943 --> 00:54:40,651
Wait a minute.

768
00:54:40,652 --> 00:54:42,028
What about Veronica?

769
00:54:42,029 --> 00:54:42,738
What?

770
00:54:42,739 --> 00:54:44,572
Darling, you are amazing.

771
00:54:44,573 --> 00:54:48,034
Really, hen, I think you two
would get along very well

772
00:54:48,035 --> 00:54:48,785
together.

773
00:54:48,786 --> 00:54:49,994
No, it's okay.

774
00:54:49,995 --> 00:54:50,621
No.

775
00:54:50,622 --> 00:54:53,789
Henry, seriously.

776
00:54:53,790 --> 00:54:55,958
Why not, Veronica? Why not?

777
00:54:55,959 --> 00:54:58,419
We could try it.

778
00:54:58,420 --> 00:55:00,380
No?

779
00:55:04,718 --> 00:55:08,346
She would look gorgeous in the
new dress.

780
00:55:08,347 --> 00:55:10,097
Don't you think so?

781
00:55:10,098 --> 00:55:13,976
Yeah.

782
00:55:13,977 --> 00:55:17,939
I'm... I'm really touched.

783
00:55:17,940 --> 00:55:22,235
I do think you're... you're very
talented, Henry.

784
00:55:22,236 --> 00:55:24,278
Like your father.

785
00:55:24,279 --> 00:55:28,491
And, uh, have you a role for

786
00:55:28,492 --> 00:55:30,368
my young friend here?

787
00:55:30,369 --> 00:55:33,121
This is too much.

788
00:55:35,541 --> 00:55:36,832
Have you acted before?

789
00:55:36,833 --> 00:55:37,751
Not really.

790
00:55:37,752 --> 00:55:39,085
He's been studying.

791
00:55:39,086 --> 00:55:40,127
It's his passion.

792
00:55:40,128 --> 00:55:41,337
It's his life force.

793
00:55:41,338 --> 00:55:42,505
It's why he's here.

794
00:55:42,506 --> 00:55:49,345
To conquer the role of Victor in
"tinto."

795
00:55:49,346 --> 00:55:54,559
The one role I'll never attempt.

796
00:55:54,560 --> 00:55:58,020
Uh, there's a couple of roles
I've doubled up.

797
00:55:58,021 --> 00:56:01,607
If you really want to try it, I
could, uh, see if I can make

798
00:56:01,608 --> 00:56:05,111
some changes.

799
00:56:05,112 --> 00:56:07,071
Wow.

800
00:56:07,072 --> 00:56:09,240
Uh, yeah, I'd be honored.

801
00:56:09,241 --> 00:56:10,324
Thank you.

802
00:56:10,325 --> 00:56:14,161
Well, what time is this music

803
00:56:14,162 --> 00:56:14,997
thing tonight?

804
00:56:14,998 --> 00:56:17,290
Should we... should we be going
pretty soon?

805
00:56:17,291 --> 00:56:18,416
Uh, you know what?

806
00:56:18,417 --> 00:56:20,334
It's not really that big of a
deal.

807
00:56:20,335 --> 00:56:21,419
We don't have to go.

808
00:56:21,420 --> 00:56:22,296
Oh, come on.

809
00:56:22,297 --> 00:56:23,546
We're all here together.

810
00:56:23,547 --> 00:56:25,256
It'll be great.

811
00:56:25,257 --> 00:56:26,382
Yeah.

812
00:56:26,383 --> 00:56:28,009
It sounds really fun.

813
00:56:28,010 --> 00:56:29,468
Come on. Let's go.

814
00:56:29,469 --> 00:56:30,220
Salute.

815
00:56:30,221 --> 00:56:31,721
Salute.

816
00:56:31,722 --> 00:56:33,056
Ta.

817
00:56:46,403 --> 00:56:48,112
You've not got a drink.

818
00:56:48,113 --> 00:56:50,531
Uh, I think Carlo has my drink.

819
00:56:50,532 --> 00:56:51,907
I'll go and check.

820
00:56:51,908 --> 00:56:57,204
You okay, kid?

821
00:56:57,205 --> 00:56:59,749
Something up?

822
00:56:59,750 --> 00:57:01,334
You feeling all right?

823
00:57:01,335 --> 00:57:04,754
Yeah, I think I just got a
little too much sun.

824
00:57:04,755 --> 00:57:08,382
If you need to go home, you
know, it's no problem.

825
00:57:08,383 --> 00:57:13,220
I'm fine. Thanks.

826
00:57:13,221 --> 00:57:14,388
Hey, Carlo.

827
00:57:14,389 --> 00:57:15,389
What?

828
00:57:30,364 --> 00:57:32,031
You get my drink?

829
00:57:32,032 --> 00:57:35,242
Sweetie, are you okay?

830
00:57:35,243 --> 00:57:36,911
I'm fine. Fine. Thanks.

831
00:57:36,912 --> 00:57:39,997
I-I think I just need a little
air.

832
00:57:39,998 --> 00:57:41,999
I'll be right back.

833
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:45,920
Sure.

834
00:57:45,921 --> 00:57:47,881
What happened?

835
00:57:51,009 --> 00:57:52,218
Gracias.

836
00:57:52,219 --> 00:57:54,179
De nada.

837
00:57:58,100 --> 00:57:59,059
You...

838
00:57:59,060 --> 00:58:02,269
Look...
It's one thing for you to

839
00:58:02,270 --> 00:58:04,689
mess around with your own fate.

840
00:58:04,690 --> 00:58:09,151
It's quite another to involve
yourself in mine.

841
00:58:09,152 --> 00:58:10,736
H-How dare you set this up?

842
00:58:10,737 --> 00:58:11,655
How dare you?

843
00:58:11,656 --> 00:58:13,447
What... what were you thinking?

844
00:58:13,448 --> 00:58:15,658
I didn't know she would be here.

845
00:58:15,659 --> 00:58:18,994
Oh, you... you've been
planning this all along, haven't

846
00:58:18,995 --> 00:58:19,454
you?

847
00:58:19,455 --> 00:58:22,373
You were following me, weren't
you?

848
00:58:22,374 --> 00:58:25,251
Is this some kind of crazy,
messed up game to you?

849
00:58:25,252 --> 00:58:26,252
This is my life.

850
00:58:26,253 --> 00:58:28,587
I didn't mean for it to go
this way.

851
00:58:28,588 --> 00:58:32,216
What way did you mean for it
to go?

852
00:58:32,217 --> 00:58:34,677
You're the one that told me
to be courageous.

853
00:58:34,678 --> 00:58:37,304
You're the one that wrote all
those plays about her.

854
00:58:37,305 --> 00:58:40,224
You're the one that said, "go,
be brave," and all of that.

855
00:58:40,225 --> 00:58:43,686
I saw that he was playing here
tonight.

856
00:58:43,687 --> 00:58:46,063
I thought...

857
00:58:46,064 --> 00:58:49,608
You and I would go.

858
00:58:49,609 --> 00:58:50,485
Hey.

859
00:58:50,486 --> 00:58:52,027
What's going on?

860
00:58:52,028 --> 00:58:53,028
You okay?

861
00:58:53,029 --> 00:58:54,864
Fine. Fine. Fine.

862
00:58:54,865 --> 00:58:56,157
Have you upset him?

863
00:58:56,158 --> 00:58:57,825
Honey, everything is fine.

864
00:58:57,826 --> 00:58:58,368
Okay.

865
00:58:58,369 --> 00:58:59,660
You want to go back inside?

866
00:58:59,661 --> 00:59:00,828
Henry's looking for you.

867
00:59:00,829 --> 00:59:01,621
Sure. Sure.

868
00:59:01,622 --> 00:59:02,663
Let's go back inside.

869
00:59:02,664 --> 00:59:03,873
Let's... let's go.

870
00:59:03,874 --> 00:59:05,834
Let's go enjoy the music.

871
00:59:09,171 --> 00:59:13,007
Oh, boy, it's hot in there.

872
00:59:13,008 --> 00:59:13,967
Yes, it is.

873
00:59:13,968 --> 00:59:15,927
Yes.

874
00:59:19,181 --> 00:59:21,098
Carlo?

875
00:59:21,099 --> 00:59:22,975
Liz.

876
00:59:22,976 --> 00:59:24,310
It is really you, isn't it?

877
00:59:24,311 --> 00:59:25,228
You stayed in Spain?

878
00:59:25,228 --> 00:59:26,021
Oh, look at you!

879
00:59:26,022 --> 00:59:27,688
Liz, I-I want you to meet,

880
00:59:27,689 --> 00:59:28,814
is this your daughter?

881
00:59:28,815 --> 00:59:30,483
No, she... oh, what a beauty.

882
00:59:30,484 --> 00:59:31,484
I'm his girlfriend.

883
00:59:31,485 --> 00:59:32,610
She's not my daughter.

884
00:59:32,611 --> 00:59:34,236
She's... nice to meet you, Liz.

885
00:59:34,237 --> 00:59:35,696
We're going back inside now.

886
00:59:35,697 --> 00:59:38,616
Yeah, I'll... I'll be in, in
a minute.

887
00:59:38,617 --> 00:59:40,284
Carlo.

888
00:59:40,285 --> 00:59:44,997
Do you know it is my son up
there, the trumpet player?

889
00:59:44,998 --> 00:59:47,625
Time flies, doesn't it?

890
00:59:47,626 --> 00:59:49,376
Yeah.

891
00:59:49,377 --> 00:59:51,462
Yeah, it does.

892
00:59:51,463 --> 00:59:53,214
I'm going back inside.

893
00:59:53,215 --> 00:59:55,175
See you inside.

894
00:59:58,678 --> 01:00:00,639
Your son is a wonderful

895
01:00:09,481 --> 01:00:10,357
Musician.

896
01:00:10,358 --> 01:00:12,691
Yeah. Yeah, he is.

897
01:00:12,692 --> 01:00:15,611
Um, I'm a bit biased, but...

898
01:00:15,612 --> 01:00:18,322
Yes.

899
01:00:18,323 --> 01:00:21,700
I'm James.

900
01:00:21,701 --> 01:00:26,956
I-I would guess son, but, um,
I made a full pot tonight

901
01:00:26,957 --> 01:00:27,666
already.

902
01:00:27,667 --> 01:00:31,168
You want to join me back inside?

903
01:00:31,169 --> 01:00:32,419
Yes.

904
01:00:32,420 --> 01:00:34,381
Let's go.

905
01:00:41,471 --> 01:00:44,557
I don't know why you think
I'm so stupid.

906
01:00:44,558 --> 01:00:46,892
What are you saying, Veronica?

907
01:00:46,893 --> 01:00:48,310
I know who she is.

908
01:00:48,311 --> 01:00:49,770
I've read your plays.

909
01:00:49,771 --> 01:00:51,480
I know exactly who she is.

910
01:00:51,481 --> 01:00:54,650
So don't... don't try and tell
me she's just an old friend.

911
01:00:54,651 --> 01:00:55,943
I'm sorry, Veronica.

912
01:00:55,944 --> 01:00:58,028
I had no idea she'd be here.

913
01:00:58,029 --> 01:01:00,114
It was the kid.

914
01:01:00,115 --> 01:01:01,115
He set this all up.

915
01:01:01,116 --> 01:01:02,700
I-I had no clue.

916
01:01:02,701 --> 01:01:05,661
I don't know what he was
thinking.

917
01:01:05,662 --> 01:01:07,538
I saw the way you looked at her.

918
01:01:07,539 --> 01:01:10,082
You've never looked at me like
that.

919
01:01:10,083 --> 01:01:11,959
I've never seen that in your
eyes.

920
01:01:11,960 --> 01:01:14,128
That's all ancient history.

921
01:01:14,129 --> 01:01:15,546
Dust and cobwebs.

922
01:01:15,547 --> 01:01:23,547
You say that, but I saw your
eyes.

923
01:01:29,185 --> 01:01:31,186
This is enough.

924
01:01:31,187 --> 01:01:32,563
Veronica.

925
01:01:32,564 --> 01:01:34,523
Veronica, wait.

926
01:01:34,524 --> 01:01:41,238
I'm so sorry.

927
01:01:41,239 --> 01:01:43,991
I-I had no idea she would be
there.

928
01:01:43,992 --> 01:01:45,701
Please, Veronica, stop.

929
01:01:45,702 --> 01:01:47,703
Please, baby. I'm so sorry.

930
01:01:47,704 --> 01:01:49,664
I'm so sorry.

931
01:01:57,047 --> 01:01:59,007
Carlo?

932
01:02:09,267 --> 01:02:10,267
Carlo!

933
01:02:10,268 --> 01:02:11,269
Carlo.

934
01:02:53,019 --> 01:02:54,395
Hi.

935
01:02:54,396 --> 01:02:55,521
It's James.

936
01:02:55,522 --> 01:02:56,314
Hello.

937
01:02:56,314 --> 01:02:56,940
Hi.

938
01:02:56,940 --> 01:02:57,774
Hello.

939
01:02:57,775 --> 01:02:59,066
What is it?

940
01:02:59,067 --> 01:03:02,987
Oh, this is, um,
tinto de verano.

941
01:03:02,988 --> 01:03:04,488
Wine of summer?

942
01:03:04,489 --> 01:03:09,159
Yeah.

943
01:03:09,160 --> 01:03:17,160
Sí.

944
01:03:37,188 --> 01:03:44,069
Were you ever called Eliza?

945
01:03:44,070 --> 01:03:46,530
Yes.

946
01:03:46,531 --> 01:03:48,657
A long time ago.

947
01:03:48,658 --> 01:03:50,993
A long, long time ago.

948
01:03:50,994 --> 01:03:53,078
Why do you ask?

949
01:03:53,079 --> 01:03:56,665
I see you here.

950
01:03:56,666 --> 01:03:59,877
And I see it all so clearly.

951
01:03:59,878 --> 01:04:01,545
What you must have been like.

952
01:04:01,546 --> 01:04:04,882
What that summer must have been
like when he wrote about it.

953
01:04:04,883 --> 01:04:06,091
What do you mean?

954
01:04:06,092 --> 01:04:09,219
When Carl wrote the play.

955
01:04:09,220 --> 01:04:12,139
I never read his plays.

956
01:04:12,140 --> 01:04:13,766
Any of them.

957
01:04:13,767 --> 01:04:15,142
Why not?

958
01:04:15,143 --> 01:04:18,771
It's too complicated, and a too

959
01:04:18,772 --> 01:04:20,397
long story for tonight.

960
01:04:20,398 --> 01:04:24,443
I have all the time in the
world, though.

961
01:04:24,444 --> 01:04:27,988
I can't believe you never read
any.

962
01:04:27,989 --> 01:04:29,448
None of them?

963
01:04:29,449 --> 01:04:32,367
I was writing my own things.

964
01:04:32,368 --> 01:04:37,372
And when Carlo's plays started
to get well-known, I...

965
01:04:37,373 --> 01:04:40,375
It was...

966
01:04:40,376 --> 01:04:44,755
I didn't want to be influenced
by them.

967
01:04:44,756 --> 01:04:48,175
It's boring.

968
01:04:48,176 --> 01:04:52,346
It's really boring.

969
01:04:52,347 --> 01:04:55,474
Tell me about you.

970
01:04:55,475 --> 01:04:57,435
I want to know about you.

971
01:05:00,688 --> 01:05:02,649
You should read them.

972
01:05:27,632 --> 01:05:31,802
Hey. James?

973
01:05:31,803 --> 01:05:35,472
There is something I want you to
tell Carlo.

974
01:05:35,473 --> 01:05:38,058
Say hi from la Serena.

975
01:05:38,059 --> 01:05:39,768
La Serena?

976
01:05:39,769 --> 01:05:41,979
He'll know what it means.

977
01:05:41,980 --> 01:05:45,357
So, my friend, if I don't see

978
01:05:45,358 --> 01:05:48,986
you again in Spain, have an
amazing adventure.

979
01:05:48,987 --> 01:05:53,031
And I do hope you find
everything you're looking for.

980
01:05:53,032 --> 01:05:54,993
Thank you.

981
01:06:08,339 --> 01:06:10,717
Bueno días.

982
01:06:15,638 --> 01:06:18,891
You, too?

983
01:06:18,892 --> 01:06:20,852
What?

984
01:06:42,248 --> 01:06:44,209
I've never...

985
01:06:52,258 --> 01:06:54,844
I've never let myself...

986
01:06:58,223 --> 01:07:03,644
Fall in love with anyone before.

987
01:07:03,645 --> 01:07:06,855
Until you.

988
01:07:06,856 --> 01:07:08,816
You.

989
01:07:15,031 --> 01:07:23,031
Then I must be very lucky.

990
01:07:28,795 --> 01:07:30,755
I'm sorry.

991
01:07:37,512 --> 01:07:39,596
I didn't mean to interrupt you.

992
01:07:39,597 --> 01:07:41,265
Go, please.

993
01:07:41,266 --> 01:07:43,225
Just leave, okay?

994
01:07:43,226 --> 01:07:46,019
Okay. I'll go get my things.

995
01:07:46,020 --> 01:07:50,315
Please do.

996
01:07:50,316 --> 01:07:53,485
Are you okay?

997
01:07:53,486 --> 01:07:54,611
No.

998
01:07:54,612 --> 01:07:57,739
No, not okay.

999
01:07:57,740 --> 01:08:00,951
I'm sorry.

1000
01:08:00,952 --> 01:08:04,913
You... you... you do stupid
things.

1001
01:08:04,914 --> 01:08:08,375
It is one thing to change your
life, but why do you come here

1002
01:08:08,376 --> 01:08:11,503
and try to change mine?

1003
01:08:11,504 --> 01:08:13,630
I'm really sorry about that.

1004
01:08:13,631 --> 01:08:16,633
I had no idea she would be
there.

1005
01:08:16,634 --> 01:08:20,804
I don't know why you came
here or what you want, but what

1006
01:08:20,805 --> 01:08:23,682
I know is I don't want you in my
house.

1007
01:08:23,683 --> 01:08:24,933
I understand.

1008
01:08:24,934 --> 01:08:28,437
Who do you think you are?

1009
01:08:28,438 --> 01:08:32,523
I don't know who I am right now.

1010
01:08:32,524 --> 01:08:35,152
Really, believe me, I didn't
mean to upset you.

1011
01:08:35,153 --> 01:08:36,861
You know what I did tonight?

1012
01:08:36,862 --> 01:08:39,323
I was at the hospital all night
with Carlo.

1013
01:08:39,324 --> 01:08:40,574
Oh, no. Is he okay?

1014
01:08:40,575 --> 01:08:41,700
Yeah, he's okay.

1015
01:08:41,701 --> 01:08:42,784
He's sleeping now.

1016
01:08:42,785 --> 01:08:46,620
But for a moment, I thought I
lost him, and...

1017
01:08:46,621 --> 01:08:54,621
You...
Just leave, okay? Go.

1018
01:10:05,576 --> 01:10:06,452
Bueno días.

1019
01:10:06,453 --> 01:10:09,245
Sorry to disturb, but I should
have called before.

1020
01:10:09,246 --> 01:10:12,040
Um, I've been making some
revisions to the scripts.

1021
01:10:12,041 --> 01:10:15,669
I've got a copy there for you
and for James.

1022
01:10:15,670 --> 01:10:17,963
Um...

1023
01:10:17,964 --> 01:10:19,756
You okay, Veronica?

1024
01:10:19,757 --> 01:10:20,591
You...

1025
01:10:20,592 --> 01:10:22,551
James is not here.

1026
01:10:22,552 --> 01:10:25,053
Do you want something to drink?

1027
01:10:25,054 --> 01:10:26,638
Coffee? Something?

1028
01:10:26,639 --> 01:10:28,557
Uh, yeah.

1029
01:10:28,558 --> 01:10:31,144
That's great. Thanks.

1030
01:10:35,731 --> 01:10:38,024
Thank you.

1031
01:10:38,025 --> 01:10:40,026
Are you sure you're okay,
Veronica?

1032
01:10:40,027 --> 01:10:41,319
You don't look too good.

1033
01:10:41,320 --> 01:10:45,365
We had to go to the hospital
last night.

1034
01:10:45,366 --> 01:10:46,700
He had one of his episodes.

1035
01:10:46,701 --> 01:10:48,201
Oh, my god. Is he all right?

1036
01:10:48,202 --> 01:10:49,369
Why didn't you call me?

1037
01:10:49,370 --> 01:10:52,122
At times like this, Veronica,
you really should call me.

1038
01:10:52,123 --> 01:10:53,415
Don't be angry with me.

1039
01:10:53,416 --> 01:10:54,624
It's been a rough night.

1040
01:10:54,625 --> 01:10:56,668
I've been up all night, all the
doctors.

1041
01:10:56,669 --> 01:10:58,086
And what do they say?

1042
01:10:58,087 --> 01:11:00,547
The usual thing... too much
excitement.

1043
01:11:00,548 --> 01:11:03,174
He needs to slow down.

1044
01:11:03,175 --> 01:11:05,593
I was so scared.

1045
01:11:05,594 --> 01:11:08,097
You... you should go and see
him.

1046
01:11:11,726 --> 01:11:13,686
Hey. Easy, easy.

1047
01:11:23,196 --> 01:11:24,738
I am not dead.

1048
01:11:24,739 --> 01:11:29,534
I can see that.

1049
01:11:29,535 --> 01:11:33,330
But you are stubborn.

1050
01:11:33,331 --> 01:11:36,917
Why am I here?

1051
01:11:36,918 --> 01:11:38,251
You okay, dad?

1052
01:11:38,252 --> 01:11:40,003
Why... why am I here?

1053
01:11:40,004 --> 01:11:45,217
Why am I here in this house with
that... that poor girl?

1054
01:11:45,218 --> 01:11:48,011
She deserves so much more than
this.

1055
01:11:48,012 --> 01:11:53,099
Sitting beside the bed of an old
man and scared to death.

1056
01:11:53,100 --> 01:11:55,602
I can't put her through this
again, you know.

1057
01:11:55,603 --> 01:12:00,524
Look... Henry.

1058
01:12:00,525 --> 01:12:03,151
I need to ask you something.

1059
01:12:03,152 --> 01:12:06,864
Of course. Whatever.

1060
01:12:14,330 --> 01:12:15,830
What is it?

1061
01:12:15,831 --> 01:12:17,791
What is this?

1062
01:12:21,212 --> 01:12:23,838
Are you leaving?

1063
01:12:23,839 --> 01:12:27,634
Are you leaving me for that
woman?

1064
01:12:27,635 --> 01:12:31,304
After I stay all night in the
hospital thinking you might die?

1065
01:12:31,305 --> 01:12:33,266
Is that what you're doing?

1066
01:12:38,938 --> 01:12:40,730
I love you.

1067
01:12:40,731 --> 01:12:42,691
I love you so much.

1068
01:12:42,692 --> 01:12:46,820
You can't do this to me.

1069
01:12:46,821 --> 01:12:49,573
I'm just gonna camp out at
Henry's for a few days.

1070
01:12:49,574 --> 01:12:50,282
That's all.

1071
01:12:50,283 --> 01:12:53,994
I-I just don't want you sitting
around here waiting for me to

1072
01:12:53,995 --> 01:12:54,537
die.

1073
01:12:54,538 --> 01:12:56,245
Oh, don't say that!

1074
01:12:56,246 --> 01:13:00,500
You need someone younger,
some... someone who can give you

1075
01:13:00,501 --> 01:13:04,588
babies if you want them, some...
Someone to grow old with.

1076
01:13:04,589 --> 01:13:06,840
You are what I need.

1077
01:13:06,841 --> 01:13:10,927
I love you.

1078
01:13:10,928 --> 01:13:12,470
You're my angel.

1079
01:13:12,471 --> 01:13:15,307
I Cherish you.

1080
01:13:15,308 --> 01:13:20,979
You... you came and you saved my
life when it needed saving, but

1081
01:13:20,980 --> 01:13:22,731
I don't want to be your burden.

1082
01:13:22,732 --> 01:13:25,942
You're not my burden.

1083
01:13:25,943 --> 01:13:28,861
You're my life.

1084
01:13:28,862 --> 01:13:30,823
Oh, baby.

1085
01:13:37,371 --> 01:13:40,915
I'll never love anyone like I
love you.

1086
01:13:40,916 --> 01:13:43,459
Yes, you will.

1087
01:13:43,460 --> 01:13:45,421
Believe me. You will.

1088
01:14:05,900 --> 01:14:07,609
Henry.

1089
01:14:07,610 --> 01:14:08,692
Hey.

1090
01:14:08,693 --> 01:14:09,861
Come up?

1091
01:14:09,862 --> 01:14:11,822
Yeah.

1092
01:14:22,583 --> 01:14:24,959
Hey.

1093
01:14:24,960 --> 01:14:27,087
How are you?

1094
01:14:27,088 --> 01:14:29,923
I brought you a copy of the

1095
01:14:29,924 --> 01:14:31,674
script so you can get started.

1096
01:14:31,675 --> 01:14:32,884
I made a few changes.

1097
01:14:32,885 --> 01:14:35,845
I'd like you to do the role of
Ezekiel.

1098
01:14:35,846 --> 01:14:38,056
Originally I had it doubled up.

1099
01:14:38,057 --> 01:14:40,308
I think I prefer you to do that.

1100
01:14:40,309 --> 01:14:41,268
Thank you.

1101
01:14:41,269 --> 01:14:42,519
I'm really honored.

1102
01:14:42,520 --> 01:14:46,147
So, first rehearsal's on
Tuesday, then every night until

1103
01:14:46,148 --> 01:14:48,024
we open, which is in two weeks.

1104
01:14:48,025 --> 01:14:48,734
Okay.

1105
01:14:48,735 --> 01:14:50,985
Don't let me down.

1106
01:14:50,986 --> 01:14:53,488
I'll do my best not to.

1107
01:14:53,489 --> 01:14:55,449
Okay.

1108
01:15:00,830 --> 01:15:02,414
How do you sleep?

1109
01:15:02,415 --> 01:15:03,957
Oh, fine. Thanks.

1110
01:15:03,958 --> 01:15:06,334
A comfy, little bedroom you got
back there.

1111
01:15:06,335 --> 01:15:07,877
Then it suits you.

1112
01:15:07,878 --> 01:15:08,546
Thanks.

1113
01:15:08,547 --> 01:15:10,088
Oh, this is black.

1114
01:15:10,089 --> 01:15:13,007
Anything I can, uh, help with?

1115
01:15:13,008 --> 01:15:14,384
Uh, for the play, I mean?

1116
01:15:14,385 --> 01:15:18,430
Well, it's the dress
rehearsal tonight.

1117
01:15:18,431 --> 01:15:20,098
Love to hear your notes.

1118
01:15:20,099 --> 01:15:24,477
I'll be there.

1119
01:15:24,478 --> 01:15:27,440
They took the child from her

1120
01:15:43,748 --> 01:15:44,331
Arms.

1121
01:15:44,332 --> 01:15:46,374
Both: They took the child.

1122
01:15:46,375 --> 01:15:49,043
Silently he swoops in.

1123
01:15:49,044 --> 01:15:54,883
Silently he swoops in, a
nightingale on angel's wings.

1124
01:15:54,884 --> 01:15:56,259
He adored her.

1125
01:15:56,260 --> 01:15:57,468
I adore her.

1126
01:15:57,469 --> 01:15:58,970
Light beyond light.

1127
01:15:58,971 --> 01:16:01,973
The heat, frozen hot.

1128
01:16:01,974 --> 01:16:03,516
I never tried to.

1129
01:16:03,517 --> 01:16:05,143
I never even tried.

1130
01:16:05,144 --> 01:16:07,771
I asked, and you entered.

1131
01:16:07,772 --> 01:16:10,106
He asked, and you entered.

1132
01:16:10,107 --> 01:16:12,108
It all means nothing.

1133
01:16:12,109 --> 01:16:20,109
It all means nothing without
you.

1134
01:16:34,882 --> 01:16:38,885
Dad.

1135
01:16:38,886 --> 01:16:42,096
Listen, I've got a few things I
need to just wrap up here.

1136
01:16:42,097 --> 01:16:45,141
So if you don't mind, we'll meet
up at the house later.

1137
01:16:45,142 --> 01:16:46,558
Oh, okay. That's fine.

1138
01:16:46,559 --> 01:16:47,353
No problem.

1139
01:16:47,354 --> 01:16:49,479
You can give me your notes
there.

1140
01:16:49,480 --> 01:16:51,689
Oh, Henry, it was... it was
great.

1141
01:16:51,690 --> 01:16:53,358
Um, really good.

1142
01:16:53,359 --> 01:16:57,278
And Ana's costumes, they were...

1143
01:16:57,279 --> 01:16:58,613
They were something else.

1144
01:16:58,614 --> 01:16:59,281
Thanks.

1145
01:16:59,282 --> 01:17:03,034
Hey, um, did, uh, Veronica
leave?

1146
01:17:03,035 --> 01:17:05,787
Yeah, she had to shoot off.

1147
01:17:05,788 --> 01:17:09,457
I'm... I'm sure she wanted to
say goodbye.

1148
01:17:09,458 --> 01:17:13,503
Well, I'll, uh, I guess I'll
see you back at the house.

1149
01:17:13,504 --> 01:17:16,172
Sounds good.

1150
01:17:16,173 --> 01:17:18,133
Oh, hey.

1151
01:17:25,474 --> 01:17:28,058
Kid, you did it.

1152
01:17:28,059 --> 01:17:31,354
You... you're an actor now,
whether you like it or not, huh?

1153
01:17:31,355 --> 01:17:33,857
Thanks.

1154
01:17:33,858 --> 01:17:35,567
Want to join me for a drink?

1155
01:17:35,568 --> 01:17:36,776
Yeah, I'd love to.

1156
01:17:36,777 --> 01:17:44,701
A little bar right around the
corner there.

1157
01:17:44,702 --> 01:17:49,539
Look, I just want to say that
I'm sorry.

1158
01:17:49,540 --> 01:17:51,749
Everybody's sorry.

1159
01:17:51,750 --> 01:17:54,209
But don't you be sorry, kid.

1160
01:17:54,210 --> 01:17:55,545
No, but I am.

1161
01:17:55,546 --> 01:17:59,966
You are someone with... with
dreams and... and hopes and...

1162
01:17:59,967 --> 01:18:06,138
And intuitions, bad as they may
be sometimes.

1163
01:18:06,139 --> 01:18:11,686
I-I admire that, to be able to
leave that safety net and just

1164
01:18:11,687 --> 01:18:16,983
leap, leap into the oblivion
blindly, not knowing if you're

1165
01:18:16,984 --> 01:18:19,067
doing the right thing.

1166
01:18:19,068 --> 01:18:20,904
Just knowing you must do it.

1167
01:18:20,905 --> 01:18:24,574
You act as if you have
nothing to aspire to, as if it's

1168
01:18:24,575 --> 01:18:27,785
all done and behind you, but I
don't believe that.

1169
01:18:27,786 --> 01:18:29,954
I think you should write
something.

1170
01:18:29,955 --> 01:18:31,664
No.

1171
01:18:31,665 --> 01:18:34,334
I think the world expects it
of you, and I think you should

1172
01:18:34,335 --> 01:18:34,752
do it.

1173
01:18:34,753 --> 01:18:37,378
I'm not so sure I should be
taking advice from

1174
01:18:37,379 --> 01:18:39,504
you.

1175
01:18:39,505 --> 01:18:42,342
What about your girl, your...
Your doctor?

1176
01:18:42,343 --> 01:18:43,927
Have you spoken to her?

1177
01:18:43,928 --> 01:18:47,972
Well, I call, but she doesn't
answer.

1178
01:18:47,973 --> 01:18:52,060
But I did do something grand and
dramatic.

1179
01:18:52,061 --> 01:18:56,064
I bought her a ticket to
Portugal and sent it to her.

1180
01:18:56,065 --> 01:18:58,816
She's always wanted to go.

1181
01:18:58,817 --> 01:19:02,611
So after the show wraps, I'll
head down that way, and if she

1182
01:19:02,612 --> 01:19:05,990
decides I'm worth it, then
she'll be there when I get

1183
01:19:05,991 --> 01:19:06,617
there.

1184
01:19:06,618 --> 01:19:08,409
That sounds pretty grand.

1185
01:19:08,410 --> 01:19:14,415
And if I lose her, at least I
tried.

1186
01:19:14,416 --> 01:19:16,668
And you were right.

1187
01:19:16,669 --> 01:19:19,712
I should have followed her.

1188
01:19:19,713 --> 01:19:22,590
I give a lot of advice that I
don't even follow myself.

1189
01:19:22,591 --> 01:19:24,717
Maybe you should stop listening
to me.

1190
01:19:24,718 --> 01:19:28,137
I'm really glad you made it out.

1191
01:19:28,138 --> 01:19:30,431
It means a lot to me.

1192
01:19:30,432 --> 01:19:33,226
Me, too.

1193
01:19:33,227 --> 01:19:34,852
Oh, I meant to tell you.

1194
01:19:34,853 --> 01:19:38,481
Uh, the night... the night that
we ran into Liz, she told me to

1195
01:19:38,482 --> 01:19:39,691
tell you something.

1196
01:19:39,692 --> 01:19:40,359
What?

1197
01:19:40,360 --> 01:19:42,110
What'd she say? What?

1198
01:19:42,111 --> 01:19:45,989
She said, "la Serena says
hi."

1199
01:19:45,990 --> 01:19:47,740
She said that? La Serena?

1200
01:19:47,741 --> 01:19:49,450
Yeah. What does it mean?

1201
01:19:49,451 --> 01:19:50,451
The mermaid.

1202
01:19:50,452 --> 01:19:53,413
I can't believe she remembered
that.

1203
01:19:53,414 --> 01:19:54,789
No, I-I got this one.

1204
01:19:54,790 --> 01:19:56,415
I think... I think I owe you.

1205
01:19:56,416 --> 01:19:59,003
Oh, thanks.

1206
01:20:28,949 --> 01:20:31,535
La Serena.

1207
01:21:05,068 --> 01:21:06,527
H-Hello. Excuse me.

1208
01:21:06,528 --> 01:21:08,361
I'm sorry to disturb you.

1209
01:21:08,362 --> 01:21:11,699
I'm... I'm looking for your
mother, actually.

1210
01:21:11,700 --> 01:21:15,870
Uh, I'm Carl, an old friend of
hers, and, uh, perhaps she's

1211
01:21:15,871 --> 01:21:17,205
back in New York.

1212
01:21:17,206 --> 01:21:19,207
My plan only got me this far.

1213
01:21:19,208 --> 01:21:21,000
She's inside, actually.

1214
01:21:21,001 --> 01:21:22,418
She's inside?

1215
01:21:22,419 --> 01:21:24,880
Yeah. Let me get the door.

1216
01:22:00,249 --> 01:22:02,209
You still have that old thing?

1217
01:22:37,702 --> 01:22:41,330
Hi.

1218
01:22:41,331 --> 01:22:46,419
Oh, how do you like that...
That play?

1219
01:22:46,420 --> 01:22:48,879
It's wonderful.

1220
01:22:48,880 --> 01:22:51,924
So you found me.

1221
01:22:51,925 --> 01:22:56,971
I have a friend who would say
it was fate.

1222
01:22:56,972 --> 01:22:59,766
You know, maybe it is.

1223
01:23:05,105 --> 01:23:06,064
So...

1224
01:23:06,065 --> 01:23:07,356
So...

1225
01:23:07,357 --> 01:23:13,988
Would you like some wine?

1226
01:23:13,989 --> 01:23:15,031
Oh, yeah.

1227
01:23:15,032 --> 01:23:18,159
That would be lovely.

1228
01:23:18,160 --> 01:23:20,120
Yeah.

1229
01:23:28,337 --> 01:23:36,337
Records.
Who has records anymore?

1230
01:23:47,481 --> 01:23:50,442
Why did you ever leave me?
