Yeah,

- Uh-huh.

246

My first unit was

- I worked with a lot

You know, finding
downed pilots and such.

- Oh.
- And then the last few years

250
00:23:31,411 --> 00:23:33,644
I worked strictly with
a snatch-and-grab team.

I did some things that
I wasn't proud of.

- Finding people.

Hey, I've got casualties
in the west corner.

Looks like they've killed
the security detail.

V, there's three coming around

what looks like

435
00:41:28,887 --> 00:41:30,620
the reactor right there.

436
00:41:30,622 --> 00:41:33,490
It's giving off
a lot of interference.

437
00:41:33,492 --> 00:41:35,091
And I'm picking up what

438
00:41:35,093 --> 00:41:37,594
I think is Dr. Whitmore
right here.

439
00:41:37,596 --> 00:41:39,262
He's in the lab area.

Okay, left takes us
to the comm room.

And if we head right

461
00:44:19,891 --> 00:44:22,158
that should take us down
to the lower research lab.

605
00:55:36,666 --> 00:55:39,101
There's a tunnel
at the far side of the complex

606
00:55:39,103 --> 00:55:40,736
leading into the valley.

I can get us there.

00:55:53,651 --> 00:55:56,952
- Alive, I hope.
- Locke: That depends on you.

What are we up against
out there?

612
00:56:03,626 --> 00:56:06,362
It came through the reactor.

613
00:56:06,364 --> 00:56:08,964
<i>I developed a machine</i>
<i>that could capture</i>
<i>ribbons of energy</i>

614
00:56:08,966 --> 00:56:11,033
in a parallel dimension.

615
00:56:11,035 --> 00:56:13,035
<i>Cromwell was funding it.</i>

616
00:56:13,037 --> 00:56:16,004
But three months ago
he started to threaten
me and my daughter,

617
00:56:16,006 --> 00:56:18,607
and I knew that
if I delivered him
the complete works,

618
00:56:18,609 --> 00:56:21,677
I would be dead.
So I overcharged the reactor

619
00:56:21,679 --> 00:56:24,813
causing a distraction,
during which I was
supposed to meet

620
00:56:24,815 --> 00:56:27,516
a rescue team that would take me
over the Russian border.

621
00:56:27,518 --> 00:56:30,719
Your rescue party was
a group of chechen terrorists.

622
00:56:30,721 --> 00:56:33,889
No! No no, they were just
supposed to escort me.

623
00:56:35,725 --> 00:56:38,427
I had to get somewhere where
cromwell couldn't get to me.

624
00:56:38,429 --> 00:56:39,828
Focus.

625
00:56:39,830 --> 00:56:41,630
Describe it.

626
00:56:41,632 --> 00:56:43,098
Is it biological?

627
00:56:43,100 --> 00:56:45,000
Is it mechanical?
What is it?

628
00:56:45,002 --> 00:56:46,835
I only saw it
for a moment.

629
00:56:46,837 --> 00:56:50,806
To come through the portal,
I think it has to be
biological.

630
00:56:50,808 --> 00:56:53,842
- Why didn't you
pick that up, huh?
- I don't know.

631
00:56:53,844 --> 00:56:56,111
- That's your job!
That is your job!
- I don't know, okay?

632
00:56:56,113 --> 00:56:57,980
It's not giving off
anything I can pick up!

633
00:56:59,849 --> 00:57:00,849
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

634
00:57:03,453 --> 00:57:05,854
Whatever that thing is,
let's headed for the tunnel.
