1
00:00:11,111 --> 00:00:13,113
[baby wailing]

2
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:25,492
[audience applauding and cheering]

3
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:29,262
Yes.

4
00:00:29,329 --> 00:00:30,363
You guys did it.

5
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:32,365
All right.

6
00:00:32,432 --> 00:00:34,134
Very nice.

7
00:00:38,671 --> 00:00:40,774
We're all living our lives, everybody.

8
00:00:42,575 --> 00:00:43,810
You get one, too.

9
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,482
Here's the deal.
Before I start, let me say this.

10
00:00:49,549 --> 00:00:53,686
I will tell you, I was listening to
a Biggie Smalls song recently.

11
00:00:54,421 --> 00:00:55,288
Yeah, I don't...

12
00:00:56,222 --> 00:00:58,258
-I don't think it was a new one.
-[audience laughing]

13
00:00:58,324 --> 00:00:59,225
And, um...

14
00:01:00,393 --> 00:01:03,530
[chuckles] Whatever happened to that guy?
He got so lazy.

15
00:01:03,596 --> 00:01:05,598
[audience laughing]

16
00:01:07,767 --> 00:01:09,636
The name of the song was called "Juicy."

17
00:01:10,136 --> 00:01:11,571
You guys remember?
It's a good song.

18
00:01:11,638 --> 00:01:14,607
It starts-- Like a lot of '90s hip-hop,
it starts the same way.

19
00:01:14,674 --> 00:01:16,709
It starts with a dedication
in the beginning.

20
00:01:17,577 --> 00:01:19,412
He doesn't start rapping right away.

21
00:01:19,479 --> 00:01:22,248
The beat comes in, before
he starts rapping Biggie Smalls goes:

22
00:01:22,315 --> 00:01:25,552
"This song is dedicated
to all the teachers who told me

23
00:01:26,119 --> 00:01:27,687
I would never amount to nothing."

24
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:29,756
[audience chuckling]

25
00:01:31,524 --> 00:01:32,392
All right.

26
00:01:33,693 --> 00:01:36,763
What school district
did Biggie Smalls go to school in?

27
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:39,365
Because that is a horrible teacher.

28
00:01:39,766 --> 00:01:41,768
Let's forget about the double negative
for a second

29
00:01:41,835 --> 00:01:44,137
and just get to the overall message.

30
00:01:44,604 --> 00:01:47,474
I can't imagine a worse thing
a teacher could do

31
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:48,541
than to go up to a--

32
00:01:48,608 --> 00:01:51,411
Well, outside of a Catholic school,
outside of a Catholic school.

33
00:01:51,478 --> 00:01:52,512
[audience laughing]

34
00:01:52,579 --> 00:01:54,647
I cannot imagine one worse thing

35
00:01:55,148 --> 00:01:59,285
a teacher could do than to go up to a kid
and just be like, "Hi, how are you?

36
00:01:59,752 --> 00:02:01,221
Oh, you're so cute.

37
00:02:02,522 --> 00:02:03,556
Did you know...

38
00:02:05,425 --> 00:02:08,294
that you will never amount to nothing?

39
00:02:09,195 --> 00:02:11,698
All right, enjoy kindergarten.
Life is meaningless."

40
00:02:11,764 --> 00:02:13,566
[audience laughs]

41
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:15,869
That's a bad teacher.
That's a really bad teacher.

42
00:02:16,603 --> 00:02:17,770
Here's the problem, though.

43
00:02:18,238 --> 00:02:20,340
That was not the only teacher
who said that to him.

44
00:02:21,774 --> 00:02:22,642
Yeah.

45
00:02:23,276 --> 00:02:26,412
If that was the only teacher who said it,
Biggie Smalls would not have said:

46
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:30,517
"To all the teachers who told me
I would never amount to nothing."

47
00:02:32,185 --> 00:02:35,288
He would've said, "To the teacher who
told me I would never amount to nothing."

48
00:02:35,355 --> 00:02:38,558
Or, "To Mrs. Johnson, this fucking bitch.
Wait till you hear what she did to me."

49
00:02:39,859 --> 00:02:42,428
He said "To all the--"
That means it wasn't even two teachers.

50
00:02:42,795 --> 00:02:44,664
If it was two, he would've said "both."

51
00:02:44,731 --> 00:02:46,499
[audience laughs]

52
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:50,270
He said, "all." "To all the teachers
who told me I would never amount to--"

53
00:02:50,336 --> 00:02:52,805
That means there were
at least three different teachers...

54
00:02:54,374 --> 00:02:56,476
who went up to a young Biggie Smalls...

55
00:02:58,578 --> 00:02:59,913
just to be like, "Excuse me.

56
00:03:01,414 --> 00:03:03,383
Excuse me, Mr. Smalls, um...

57
00:03:05,752 --> 00:03:07,887
We've all been talking
in the teacher's lounge.

58
00:03:09,622 --> 00:03:12,492
And we just want you to know,
you're not gonna go anywhere in life."

59
00:03:13,626 --> 00:03:14,494
Yeah, rude.

60
00:03:15,762 --> 00:03:17,363
He was probably pretty upset by that.

61
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:19,299
He was probably like, "Why not?"

62
00:03:19,532 --> 00:03:21,668
And they were probably like,
"Your grades are terrible.

63
00:03:22,902 --> 00:03:25,505
You're only good at poetry.
What are you gonna do with that?"

64
00:03:25,572 --> 00:03:27,941
[audience laughing]

65
00:03:31,511 --> 00:03:32,946
Biggie Smalls didn't listen to them.

66
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,848
He ignored them.
He was able to overcome it

67
00:03:36,416 --> 00:03:38,751
and become probably
one of the greatest rappers of all time.

68
00:03:38,818 --> 00:03:39,786
[audience member cheers]

69
00:03:39,852 --> 00:03:41,621
Yeah, he's not here.
Don't worry about. Hmm.

70
00:03:41,688 --> 00:03:43,256
[audience laughs]

71
00:03:43,323 --> 00:03:44,390
With that in mind...

72
00:03:45,291 --> 00:03:45,959
this set

73
00:03:46,693 --> 00:03:47,727
is dedicated...

74
00:03:49,796 --> 00:03:53,967
to the guidance counselors at the
Hebrew Academy of Greater Washington...

75
00:03:54,567 --> 00:03:56,569
[audience laughing and clapping]

76
00:03:57,737 --> 00:03:59,672
for always telling me to apply myself.

77
00:04:01,441 --> 00:04:03,376
Yeah, I also ignored them.

78
00:04:04,444 --> 00:04:06,779
And that's why Ari's not a lawyer.

79
00:04:06,846 --> 00:04:08,548
[audience laughs]

80
00:04:09,882 --> 00:04:12,352
I was smart. When I was little,
I was legitimately smart.

81
00:04:12,418 --> 00:04:13,786
I really was, I really was.

82
00:04:14,287 --> 00:04:18,825
And then I smoked pot, like, a couple
times a day for 15 years, and, uh...

83
00:04:19,692 --> 00:04:21,561
And now
I forgot to write the end of that joke.

84
00:04:21,628 --> 00:04:23,630
[audience laughs]

85
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:30,303
My friend told me--
My friend broke up with his girlfriend.

86
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:32,639
He told me he texted her
like a week later.

87
00:04:32,705 --> 00:04:35,675
Texted her and told her that
she needs to get tested for herpes.

88
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:38,811
Yeah, and I was like, "Dude,

89
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:40,680
that's a phone call."

90
00:04:40,747 --> 00:04:42,048
[audience laughs]

91
00:04:44,317 --> 00:04:45,852
I know we live in a texting society,

92
00:04:45,918 --> 00:04:47,920
but there's certain moments
you gotta hear a voice.

93
00:04:48,554 --> 00:04:50,757
You know what I mean?
You can't get some texts.

94
00:04:50,823 --> 00:04:53,626
You can't get a text that says,
"Come identify this body."

95
00:04:53,693 --> 00:04:54,994
[audience laughing]

96
00:04:55,061 --> 00:04:56,829
You'll be like,
"New phone, who is this?

97
00:04:56,896 --> 00:04:58,531
I don't have you in my contacts."

98
00:04:59,632 --> 00:05:00,500
You know?

99
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:02,769
There's certain moments
where a text won't do.

100
00:05:02,835 --> 00:05:04,771
The STD call, that's one of those times.

101
00:05:05,705 --> 00:05:07,407
I get it. It's a hard phone call to make.

102
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:09,942
I understand. I've been there.
I've made that phone call.

103
00:05:10,576 --> 00:05:11,678
Yeah, it's difficult.

104
00:05:12,745 --> 00:05:14,614
You gotta do it.
You gotta keep calling exes

105
00:05:14,681 --> 00:05:16,382
until you've reached the head vampire.

106
00:05:16,449 --> 00:05:17,717
[audience laughing]

107
00:05:17,784 --> 00:05:18,651
And then...

108
00:05:19,419 --> 00:05:21,020
And then you can stop calling.

109
00:05:22,689 --> 00:05:25,925
I hope you guys never have to
make that call. I really do, I really do.

110
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:27,694
But if you ever do, here's my suggestion.

111
00:05:28,394 --> 00:05:29,629
Make a fun game out of it.

112
00:05:31,364 --> 00:05:34,434
Yeah, entertain yourself,
'cause they're not gonna be entertained.

113
00:05:35,635 --> 00:05:37,804
So, someone may as well
get some joy out of it.

114
00:05:38,571 --> 00:05:40,506
I called this woman. She was like:

115
00:05:40,573 --> 00:05:42,709
"Ari, what's up?
I haven't talked to you in two weeks.

116
00:05:42,775 --> 00:05:46,045
How are you? I'm happy to hear from you."
And I was like, "Uh, don't be so excited."

117
00:05:46,112 --> 00:05:48,014
[audience laughs]

118
00:05:48,081 --> 00:05:50,750
I was like, "I've got good news,
and I've got bad news."

119
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:52,719
And she was like, "Oh, fun. Okay."

120
00:05:53,686 --> 00:05:56,022
She was like, "What's the good news?"
I was like, "Well...

121
00:05:56,956 --> 00:05:57,890
the good news...

122
00:05:58,658 --> 00:05:59,659
is that...

123
00:05:59,726 --> 00:06:00,827
chlamydia...

124
00:06:02,128 --> 00:06:06,099
is one of the most
easily curable diseases...

125
00:06:07,667 --> 00:06:09,001
that anyone could ever get."

126
00:06:09,068 --> 00:06:11,070
[audience laughing]

127
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:23,750
And she was like,
"Yeah, I mean, I guess that's good news."

128
00:06:25,384 --> 00:06:26,986
She was like,
"What's-- What's the bad news?"

129
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:29,989
And I was like, "Do you really not know
what the bad news is?

130
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:32,058
[audience laughing]

131
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:34,393
Think about it. You'll get it.

132
00:06:35,695 --> 00:06:37,697
No, I mean, I talked to my doctor.
You will get it.

133
00:06:37,764 --> 00:06:39,432
There's no way around that.

134
00:06:40,867 --> 00:06:43,002
Get treated, not tested.
For sure you have it."

135
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:45,071
[audience laughing]

136
00:06:48,541 --> 00:06:51,444
Has anybody in here ever had
chlamydia before? By a round of applause.

137
00:06:51,677 --> 00:06:52,612
One guy.

138
00:06:52,678 --> 00:06:56,549
A few of you. Of course, Texas.
Wait, is it just one person?

139
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:58,885
[man] I raised my hand twice.

140
00:06:58,951 --> 00:07:01,587
All right, you've had it twice. [laughs]

141
00:07:01,654 --> 00:07:02,855
"I raised my hand twice."

142
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:04,724
[audience clapping]

143
00:07:05,825 --> 00:07:08,861
Well, you're the expert, man. I guess.
You're the new expert.

144
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:10,163
It's curable, right?

145
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:11,764
-[man] Yeah.
-Yeah, it goes away.

146
00:07:11,831 --> 00:07:13,099
It obviously goes away.

147
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:14,867
-[man] Shot in the ass.
-Shot in the ass.

148
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:18,604
Well, they gave me pills. You might
still have chlamydia. I don't know.

149
00:07:18,671 --> 00:07:22,108
But they gave me pills. Yeah, yeah,
it's different ways to take it, for sure.

150
00:07:22,175 --> 00:07:23,042
You're all right.

151
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:25,778
And then it goes away forever.

152
00:07:25,845 --> 00:07:28,681
Or until you fuck someone else
with chlamydia. Then it's right back.

153
00:07:29,515 --> 00:07:31,684
-You gave it to them back?
-[man] It was the same person.

154
00:07:31,751 --> 00:07:33,853
-You gave it to her and she gave it back?
-[man] Yeah.

155
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,955
Wow, such a family.
You guys should get married.

156
00:07:36,756 --> 00:07:38,691
What a lovely, romantic story that is.

157
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:43,162
It's antibiotics and it's gone.
Sometimes they'll give pills.

158
00:07:43,229 --> 00:07:45,832
And if it's pills, it's either two days
or four days

159
00:07:45,898 --> 00:07:48,634
or at maximum ten days of pills
and then gone forever.

160
00:07:48,935 --> 00:07:51,471
It's the "I'll let you off
with a warning" of STDs.

161
00:07:51,537 --> 00:07:53,539
[audience laughs]

162
00:07:54,173 --> 00:07:56,809
Every patient whose doctor tells them
they have chlamydia goes:

163
00:07:56,876 --> 00:07:59,212
"Yes, officer, I'll never speed again.
I apologize."

164
00:08:00,513 --> 00:08:01,781
It could've been a lot worse.

165
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:07,720
By the way, to catch you guys up,
black people in here,

166
00:08:07,787 --> 00:08:10,490
when I say, "I'll let you off
with a warning," that's a white term.

167
00:08:10,556 --> 00:08:13,125
-Uh...
-[audience laughing]

168
00:08:13,192 --> 00:08:14,760
That's, uh...

169
00:08:14,827 --> 00:08:17,763
something that happens once in a while
when a cop pulls you over

170
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:19,098
and instead of, uh,

171
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:22,568
giving you a ticket or shooting you,
they'll be like, "Ah, get out of here."

172
00:08:23,569 --> 00:08:26,038
It's awesome.
White privilege, you guys, it's awesome.

173
00:08:26,105 --> 00:08:28,107
[audience chuckling]

174
00:08:32,545 --> 00:08:35,281
But at worst, ten days of pills,
then gone. You can handle that, right?

175
00:08:35,548 --> 00:08:36,949
You could deal with that, too.

176
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:39,785
Ten days of pills.
You can say you lost your prescription,

177
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:42,622
get double, put the rest in her drink.
Never have to have that talk.

178
00:08:42,688 --> 00:08:44,690
[audience laughing]

179
00:08:49,262 --> 00:08:50,763
Here's what it means for humanity.

180
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:53,165
Here's what "ten days of pills, then gone"
means for humanity.

181
00:08:53,232 --> 00:08:54,267
That means...

182
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:56,235
if everyone in the world with chlamydia

183
00:08:57,737 --> 00:08:59,539
could just stop fucking

184
00:09:00,606 --> 00:09:02,074
for ten days...

185
00:09:02,141 --> 00:09:04,677
[audience laughing and clapping]

186
00:09:09,248 --> 00:09:11,584
there would be no more chlamydia.

187
00:09:15,021 --> 00:09:18,024
But the people of Earth are like,
"Well, we don't accept those terms.

188
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:20,092
[audience laughing]

189
00:09:21,694 --> 00:09:23,062
That's just too difficult.

190
00:09:23,896 --> 00:09:26,832
We'll give you eight days and chance it.
The best we can do for you."

191
00:09:31,871 --> 00:09:35,007
Ever think you have something 'cause
you had sex once in the last three months,

192
00:09:35,074 --> 00:09:36,709
you got one itch and you're like:

193
00:09:36,776 --> 00:09:38,678
"Yeah,
I've got everything that's ever existed.

194
00:09:38,744 --> 00:09:39,812
What's that itch about?

195
00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:42,715
What's that itch if I don't have
everything? My dick's gonna fall off."

196
00:09:43,349 --> 00:09:45,618
Sucks.
You self-diagnose. You ever do that?

197
00:09:45,685 --> 00:09:48,888
Where you're like, "It's this or this."
Never ask your guy friends, by the way.

198
00:09:50,189 --> 00:09:52,091
Never ask male friends for help
on what it is.

199
00:09:52,158 --> 00:09:54,727
I was like, "I got this like--"
"AIDS, you have AIDS for sure."

200
00:09:54,794 --> 00:09:56,162
[audience laughing]

201
00:09:56,228 --> 00:09:58,831
"I haven't told you the symptoms,"
"I can look at you, AIDS-y.

202
00:09:58,898 --> 00:10:00,066
For sure you have AIDS."

203
00:10:02,969 --> 00:10:04,971
[chuckles]

204
00:10:06,372 --> 00:10:08,708
One time--
One time, I thought I had herpes.

205
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:12,144
I was positive I did. It was like
ten years ago. I mean, I was sure.

206
00:10:12,211 --> 00:10:14,914
It was--
Okay, it ended up being a cut on my dick.

207
00:10:16,082 --> 00:10:18,017
I'll tell you how I got it later, but...

208
00:10:18,351 --> 00:10:22,054
But I will tell you, if you Google-Image-
Search the words "cut on your dick"...

209
00:10:23,022 --> 00:10:24,690
a lot of herpes pictures come up.

210
00:10:25,758 --> 00:10:27,326
So, I was positive I had it.

211
00:10:27,927 --> 00:10:30,363
I had to call this woman and be like,
"Hey, uh...

212
00:10:30,997 --> 00:10:32,164
bad news, bad news.

213
00:10:32,231 --> 00:10:34,233
[audience laughing and clapping]

214
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:38,838
Yeah, you got the worst one."

215
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:43,209
And, uh, she was not happy about it.

216
00:10:43,909 --> 00:10:46,078
I went to a doctor to get tested
and the doctor was like:

217
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:48,114
"No, you don't-- You don't have herpes."

218
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:50,016
And I was like, "Are you sure?"

219
00:10:50,082 --> 00:10:52,418
And he goes, "I mean,
you wanna do best two out of three?"

220
00:10:52,685 --> 00:10:53,886
[audience laughs]

221
00:10:53,953 --> 00:10:56,355
And I was like, "Yeah, run it back, man.
Run it back."

222
00:10:56,956 --> 00:10:59,258
He's like, "You don't have herpes."
I was like, "What is it?"

223
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:02,762
And he goes,
"You have a tear of the penile membrane."

224
00:11:03,729 --> 00:11:05,064
Yeah, it sounds worse, right?

225
00:11:06,065 --> 00:11:08,701
I was like, "What that's?
What's a tear of the penile membrane?"

226
00:11:08,768 --> 00:11:10,770
And he goes,
"It means you have a cut on your dick."

227
00:11:11,837 --> 00:11:13,239
I was like, "How'd I get a cut?"

228
00:11:13,305 --> 00:11:16,075
He goes, "I don't know. It's not my dick.
That's not how this works.

229
00:11:16,142 --> 00:11:18,010
[audience laughing]

230
00:11:18,077 --> 00:11:20,379
I'm not a fortune teller.
I just diagnose people.

231
00:11:21,814 --> 00:11:23,849
If you had a broken leg,
I'm not like, 'Basketball?'

232
00:11:23,916 --> 00:11:26,719
I just tell you it's broken.
I'm not a fucking wizard. I have no idea.

233
00:11:26,786 --> 00:11:28,187
I don't know how you think this works.

234
00:11:28,254 --> 00:11:31,257
What, have you been masturbating
harder than normal? I don't know."

235
00:11:31,824 --> 00:11:33,793
I go, "Same as always."
He goes, "Think about it."

236
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:35,728
I was like, "Okay."
He goes, "Sit here and think

237
00:11:35,795 --> 00:11:37,263
and I will be back in ten minutes."

238
00:11:38,464 --> 00:11:40,733
He visited other patients
and came back, and goes:

239
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,002
"Did you figure it out?"
I was like, "I think I did, man."

240
00:11:43,903 --> 00:11:46,038
I think I did.
It was about a month before that.

241
00:11:46,872 --> 00:11:48,841
Yeah, right about when I noticed the cut.

242
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:51,343
I had, uh...

243
00:11:52,244 --> 00:11:53,312
I had anal sex.

244
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:56,215
Uh, giving.

245
00:11:56,282 --> 00:11:58,117
[audience laughing]

246
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,022
I wasn't taking it.
I was like, "I hate myself.

247
00:12:03,089 --> 00:12:05,891
Why do I always fall into these traps?
Cut, cut, punish."

248
00:12:06,892 --> 00:12:09,061
Yeah, no, I was dishing it out, and, uh...

249
00:12:11,197 --> 00:12:12,465
I ask him "Could it be that?"

250
00:12:12,731 --> 00:12:14,767
He goes,
"Yes, absolutely, it could be that."

251
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:16,335
I was like, "All right."

252
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:18,938
He goes, "Did you use lubrication?
Did you use lube?"

253
00:12:19,004 --> 00:12:20,840
And I was like, "No, I did not.

254
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,141
Should I have?"

255
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:25,878
He goes, "Yes, absolutely, you should've
used lube when you had anal sex."

256
00:12:26,278 --> 00:12:27,880
I said, "Is that a medical thing?"

257
00:12:27,947 --> 00:12:30,282
And he goes,
"No, I'm just a guy and I'm telling you.

258
00:12:30,349 --> 00:12:34,186
Don't stick your raw dick into
someone's asshole, you fucking animal.

259
00:12:34,787 --> 00:12:35,988
The fuck is wrong with you?

260
00:12:36,055 --> 00:12:38,858
I knew that before medical school.
Jesus Christ, dude."

261
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:40,926
[audience laughing]

262
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,328
I was like, "All right."

263
00:12:44,864 --> 00:12:48,100
So, he gave me some antiseptic cream,
some Neosporin.

264
00:12:48,167 --> 00:12:49,935
He said, "Put that on."
I said, "All right."

265
00:12:50,002 --> 00:12:53,038
He goes, "That's not for lube."
And I'm like, "I know it's not for lube."

266
00:12:53,939 --> 00:12:57,209
I didn't know. I didn't know.
I thought it was. I really thought it was.

267
00:12:58,043 --> 00:13:00,079
I really did. I acted like I knew,
but I didn't know.

268
00:13:00,146 --> 00:13:02,348
I thought he was just giving me
like one dose of lube.

269
00:13:02,414 --> 00:13:03,983
I thought he was a cool doctor.

270
00:13:04,917 --> 00:13:07,319
I thought he was like,
"Next time, [clicks tongue] try that."

271
00:13:07,386 --> 00:13:09,388
[audience laughing]

272
00:13:13,092 --> 00:13:14,126
[chuckles]

273
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:17,329
I went home, you know,
and I was all happy about it. No herpes.

274
00:13:17,396 --> 00:13:20,432
It was the first time in my life I didn't
take for granted not having herpes.

275
00:13:21,066 --> 00:13:22,868
Every other moment,
I never thought about it.

276
00:13:22,935 --> 00:13:24,203
We all take it for granted, right?

277
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:26,305
Or three out of four of us
take it for granted.

278
00:13:26,372 --> 00:13:27,406
[audience laughing]

279
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:30,342
The other one out of four's like,
"I remember when I didn't have herpes.

280
00:13:32,511 --> 00:13:34,079
Wish I still didn't have it."

281
00:13:36,148 --> 00:13:39,885
I was all happy. Everywhere I went it was
like rose-colored glasses, you know?

282
00:13:39,952 --> 00:13:43,289
Everything bad that happened to me didn't
really matter 'cause I didn't have herpes.

283
00:13:43,355 --> 00:13:47,126
I went to  Star Wars Episode I
first weekend, opening Saturday night.

284
00:13:47,193 --> 00:13:49,028
I was like, "Two tickets to  Star Wars."

285
00:13:49,094 --> 00:13:50,963
And they were like,
"Are you out of your mind?

286
00:13:51,397 --> 00:13:53,399
This has been sold out for four months."

287
00:13:53,465 --> 00:13:56,969
The guy's like, "I'm sorry." I'm like,
"No big deal. I don't have herpes.

288
00:13:58,337 --> 00:14:00,873
I'll just go see  The Notebook
and still not have herpes."

289
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:02,374
[audience laughs]

290
00:14:03,075 --> 00:14:05,077
And then I realize
I gotta call that woman back.

291
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:09,014
There's someone that thinks they have
herpes and doesn't, so, I had to call.

292
00:14:09,081 --> 00:14:12,418
Here's how she answered the phone
when I called: "What do you want?"

293
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:16,288
You know, she was still upset
about the last conversation, you know?

294
00:14:16,555 --> 00:14:17,890
Didn't really go her way.

295
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:21,427
I was like, "Good news, I have good news."

296
00:14:21,493 --> 00:14:24,096
"What?" I said, "You don't have herpes."
She was like, "Really?"

297
00:14:24,163 --> 00:14:25,598
I was like,
"I don't know. You might.

298
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:28,968
I don't know who else you're fucking,
but I for sure don't have it."

299
00:14:29,602 --> 00:14:32,605
She's like, "What was it?"
I was like, "Just a cut on my dick."

300
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:34,573
And man, we laughed about that.

301
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:38,344
I was like, "I can't believe it."
She goes, "How'd you cut your dick?"

302
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:40,479
I was like,
"Eh, don't worry about it. No big deal."

303
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:42,248
[audience laughs]

304
00:14:43,082 --> 00:14:45,351
I guess what happened was,
the way the doctor explained it:

305
00:14:45,417 --> 00:14:48,053
you guys ever take a cork
out of a bottle of wine?

306
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,588
And if you don't take it straight out,

307
00:14:49,655 --> 00:14:52,057
but if you take it
like a little bit at an angle,

308
00:14:52,124 --> 00:14:53,559
sometimes the cork can break.

309
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:57,897
All right, I don't wanna get
into specifics with you guys, but...

310
00:14:57,963 --> 00:14:59,965
[audience laughing]

311
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:05,404
Here's-- Here's the one thing
I came away with, that whole thing,

312
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:09,275
that Neosporin would be the worst lube
to use for anal sex.

313
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:13,345
That's the only thing I took out of it.
It'd feel good while you're doing it.

314
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:16,682
But here's the problem, when you're done,
your butthole would just like...

315
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:18,684
seal up.

316
00:15:18,951 --> 00:15:20,986
[audience laughing]

317
00:15:21,053 --> 00:15:23,656
It would just heal away
until you have no butthole.

318
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:26,659
You'd be buttless.

319
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:30,329
You guys know how science works?

320
00:15:30,396 --> 00:15:32,598
Understand how science works?
That's what would happen.

321
00:15:36,035 --> 00:15:37,069
You guys are gonna look up,

322
00:15:37,136 --> 00:15:40,272
"Would Neosporin make your butthole
go away?" [chuckles]

323
00:15:40,339 --> 00:15:41,974
Trust me, you don't have to look it up.

324
00:15:43,976 --> 00:15:47,112
I've been to a few countries this year,
actually. I went to Amsterdam last year.

325
00:15:47,179 --> 00:15:48,614
-[audience cheers]
-You guys been there?

326
00:15:48,681 --> 00:15:51,083
Did you smoke pot?
Did you smoke pot while you were there?

327
00:15:51,383 --> 00:15:53,185
What else are you gonna do,
go to museums?

328
00:15:53,252 --> 00:15:55,254
Kill yourself.
There's no reason to do that.

329
00:15:55,988 --> 00:15:58,023
You can see all of Van Gogh's works
on the Internet.

330
00:15:58,090 --> 00:15:59,959
There's no reason to go to Amsterdam
for that.

331
00:16:01,393 --> 00:16:04,630
But there's legal marijuana.
Fully legal marijuana, yeah.

332
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:08,600
Yeah, it's awesome. At coffee shops,
right? They're called coffee shops.

333
00:16:08,667 --> 00:16:09,702
[man] They serve coffee?

334
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:12,371
Yeah, no, they don't serve coffee.
That's the weird thing.

335
00:16:12,438 --> 00:16:14,239
I don't know why
they're called coffee shops.

336
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:16,608
I don't know where
you buy coffee in Amsterdam, to be honest.

337
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:20,012
Coffee might be illegal in Amsterdam.

338
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:22,081
[audience laughing]

339
00:16:23,716 --> 00:16:26,118
Maybe you gotta go to one of those
fake L.A.-style doctors

340
00:16:26,185 --> 00:16:29,254
and be like, "Doctor, I'm having trouble
waking up in the morning.

341
00:16:30,589 --> 00:16:32,624
Can I get some Ethiopian blend
or something?"

342
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:36,161
What'd you guys think of the weed?

343
00:16:36,228 --> 00:16:37,162
[audience cheers]

344
00:16:37,229 --> 00:16:38,597
-[man 1] Yes.
-[man 2] Yeah, oh, yeah.

345
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:41,066
No, it was so-so, to be honest. Yeah.

346
00:16:41,133 --> 00:16:43,769
Oh, you're used to Texas fucking
Odessa weed. That's the problem.

347
00:16:44,036 --> 00:16:46,071
[audience laughs]

348
00:16:46,138 --> 00:16:49,141
The shit you bring in from Mexico.

349
00:16:52,144 --> 00:16:54,213
You're not supposed to sell weed
by the brick.

350
00:16:55,114 --> 00:16:57,583
That's when you know it's bad weed.
"How many bricks do you want?"

351
00:16:57,649 --> 00:16:59,184
"Bricks? What are you talking about?

352
00:16:59,651 --> 00:17:00,786
Eighths, man, eighths."

353
00:17:03,088 --> 00:17:06,091
It was good, but it just wasn't the best.
It was like B-plus, A-minus weed.

354
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:09,495
Yeah, and I smoke pot everywhere,
you guys. I smoke pot all over the world.

355
00:17:09,561 --> 00:17:11,597
-[audience cheers and claps]
-Yeah, that's what I do.

356
00:17:11,663 --> 00:17:13,732
That's how I prove I'm a free American.

357
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:15,200
Yeah.

358
00:17:16,135 --> 00:17:19,071
You know who has the worst weed?
The worst weed in the world?

359
00:17:19,138 --> 00:17:19,805
Australia.

360
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:22,608
By far the worst.
I'm telling you, I've smoked everywhere.

361
00:17:22,674 --> 00:17:24,743
I smoked pot in the streets of Shanghai,

362
00:17:25,344 --> 00:17:26,779
where it's punishable by death.

363
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:30,549
I was rolling a joint and my friend said,
"They'll fucking kill you.

364
00:17:30,616 --> 00:17:31,750
Are you crazy?"

365
00:17:31,817 --> 00:17:34,753
And I was like, "Well, now I need it
more than ever. I'm fucking nervous.

366
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:37,222
My God, you turned this medicinal.

367
00:17:37,289 --> 00:17:38,690
It was crazy what you just did."

368
00:17:38,757 --> 00:17:40,759
[audience chuckling]

369
00:17:43,162 --> 00:17:45,731
I was in Australia and I was drinking.
I had like two or three beers.

370
00:17:45,798 --> 00:17:48,634
Somebody said, "Can I buy you a beer?"
I was like, "I'm getting drunk."

371
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:50,469
And they were like,
"Oh, you fucking pussy.

372
00:17:50,769 --> 00:17:53,072
You can't handle your alcohol.
Fucking pussy."

373
00:17:53,138 --> 00:17:56,575
They kept saying it and I said, "Light up
one of your dirt joints right now.

374
00:17:57,176 --> 00:17:59,578
And I will smoke this whole country
under the table.

375
00:18:01,146 --> 00:18:03,615
I will go hit for hit
with every citizen in Australia

376
00:18:03,682 --> 00:18:05,384
and I will bury all of you."

377
00:18:05,451 --> 00:18:07,252
[audience laughing]

378
00:18:10,689 --> 00:18:14,093
Yeah, the Amsterdam weed was good, though.
It just wasn't the best.

379
00:18:14,159 --> 00:18:16,195
My friend's like,
"You didn't try the right place."

380
00:18:16,261 --> 00:18:17,729
I'm like, "I tried all the places.

381
00:18:17,796 --> 00:18:19,731
[audience laughs]

382
00:18:19,798 --> 00:18:21,800
I was very thorough in my investigation."

383
00:18:22,835 --> 00:18:24,870
Here's how I proved it.
I went to every coffee shop.

384
00:18:25,137 --> 00:18:26,572
I strutted to the front and I was like:

385
00:18:26,638 --> 00:18:29,875
"Hey, hey, hey,
sell me your strongest weed

386
00:18:30,142 --> 00:18:32,211
or America wins again."

387
00:18:32,277 --> 00:18:34,546
[audience laughing]

388
00:18:35,347 --> 00:18:39,651
But I wore, like, a cowboy hat
and Confederate-flag suspenders,

389
00:18:39,718 --> 00:18:41,620
big Mickey Mouse belt buckle.

390
00:18:43,322 --> 00:18:45,858
Like, they hated me.
They wanted to prove it, you know?

391
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:47,693
This one guy went to a bottom drawer.

392
00:18:47,759 --> 00:18:49,828
Two guys had to turn a key
at the same time.

393
00:18:51,497 --> 00:18:53,832
This drawer opens up
and dry ice came out of it.

394
00:18:54,466 --> 00:18:55,501
And he held up this nug

395
00:18:55,567 --> 00:18:58,270
and he was like, "Smoke that.
It's the last of Hitler's reserves.

396
00:19:00,606 --> 00:19:02,307
If he didn't kill you, this will."

397
00:19:02,374 --> 00:19:04,376
[audience laughing]

398
00:19:11,316 --> 00:19:14,186
I smoked. He's like, "What do you think?"
And I was like, "It'll do."

399
00:19:14,253 --> 00:19:16,255
[audience laughing]

400
00:19:17,322 --> 00:19:19,458
You guys wanna hear
the worst side effect of marijuana?

401
00:19:19,925 --> 00:19:22,427
Yeah, they don't tell you about this
in the D.A.R.E. program.

402
00:19:23,195 --> 00:19:23,862
They always lie.

403
00:19:23,929 --> 00:19:27,399
All those outreach programs, they lie
a bit to, like, try to convince kids,

404
00:19:27,466 --> 00:19:30,502
but kids see through it, so, then they,
like, don't hear the message at all.

405
00:19:30,569 --> 00:19:31,904
They're like, "If you smoke pot,

406
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:34,439
you're gonna end up living
in your grandmother's basement."

407
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:37,176
I'm always like,
"Uh, that's a wonderful thing to do."

408
00:19:37,242 --> 00:19:38,710
[audience laughs]

409
00:19:38,777 --> 00:19:40,879
If you live and take care of
your elderly grandmother,

410
00:19:40,946 --> 00:19:43,615
that's an amazing,
charitable way to live your life.

411
00:19:43,682 --> 00:19:45,450
You're a way better person than me.

412
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:47,920
That is not a side effect of marijuana.
Absolutely not.

413
00:19:50,722 --> 00:19:52,424
Here's the worst side effect
of marijuana.

414
00:19:53,592 --> 00:19:56,628
It's when you watch 44 minutes
of an episode of  Law and Order

415
00:19:57,529 --> 00:20:00,465
before you realize
you've seen it nine times before.

416
00:20:00,532 --> 00:20:02,534
[audience laughing]

417
00:20:05,737 --> 00:20:08,907
That's real shit that could happen to you,
and it's not a good feeling

418
00:20:09,474 --> 00:20:11,977
when you realize how many times
you've wasted that much time.

419
00:20:12,911 --> 00:20:15,480
If you're high when you're watching,
it's more of a betrayal

420
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:16,782
'cause you get way into it.

421
00:20:17,516 --> 00:20:20,219
You know, I'm always watching high,
I'm like, "This fucking judge.

422
00:20:20,619 --> 00:20:21,920
He threw out the evidence.

423
00:20:23,655 --> 00:20:25,724
They're never gonna get
this motherfucker now.

424
00:20:26,325 --> 00:20:28,327
He'll be on the beach
with his wife sipping Mai Tais

425
00:20:28,393 --> 00:20:29,895
and laughing at the justice system.

426
00:20:30,762 --> 00:20:33,799
Oh, fuck, his wife tricks him.
Goddamn it, I remember this."

427
00:20:33,865 --> 00:20:35,867
[audience laughing]

428
00:20:40,305 --> 00:20:42,007
Did you go to the Anne Frank House
in Amsterdam?

429
00:20:42,274 --> 00:20:44,910
-[audience members] Yeah!
-I went, too. I didn't know it was there.

430
00:20:44,977 --> 00:20:45,877
[man] Yes.

431
00:20:45,944 --> 00:20:49,314
I mean, I knew if you quizzed me,
but I didn't really know, you know?

432
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:51,383
If you-- I knew it was in Europe.

433
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:53,452
Me and my friend
were going to the Heineken factory.

434
00:20:53,518 --> 00:20:54,886
Heineken's based in Amsterdam.

435
00:20:54,953 --> 00:20:57,256
We were headed there
and then we like walked by it,

436
00:20:57,322 --> 00:20:59,258
and I was like,
"Oh, fuck, the Anne Frank House."

437
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:00,759
It was super easy to find.

438
00:21:00,826 --> 00:21:03,362
I do not know what took
the Germans so long. It was fucking...

439
00:21:03,428 --> 00:21:04,696
[audience laughing]

440
00:21:04,763 --> 00:21:05,897
It's fucking right there.

441
00:21:09,701 --> 00:21:11,637
They could not have been--
They were not looking.

442
00:21:11,703 --> 00:21:12,904
For sure they were not looking.

443
00:21:13,472 --> 00:21:16,008
That is not the well-oiled machine
they would have you believe.

444
00:21:16,675 --> 00:21:18,944
It was right on the waterfront.
I mean, whatever, but...

445
00:21:20,445 --> 00:21:23,048
It was this house where Anne Frank lived
for a little while.

446
00:21:23,315 --> 00:21:25,317
[audience titters]

447
00:21:27,352 --> 00:21:29,688
You guys,
it's about to get so much worse, so...

448
00:21:29,755 --> 00:21:31,523
[audience laughing]

449
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:34,393
If you're gonna turn on me
on that tagline of a joke,

450
00:21:34,459 --> 00:21:36,328
you're in for a bad seven minutes.

451
00:21:40,899 --> 00:21:43,402
I saw it and I told my friend,
"I think I gotta go in here."

452
00:21:43,468 --> 00:21:44,970
And he's like, "To the Anne Frank House?"

453
00:21:45,037 --> 00:21:47,739
He was like,
"Why? This seems like a downer."

454
00:21:48,473 --> 00:21:50,609
I'm like,
"For sure it's gonna be a downer."

455
00:21:51,677 --> 00:21:54,346
I don't think there's any good rides
at the Anne Frank House.

456
00:21:57,849 --> 00:22:01,486
Not like the Heineken factory.
The Heineken factory has a Heineken boat.

457
00:22:01,553 --> 00:22:04,790
Yeah, and it goes down a river of Heineken
through the whole warehouse.

458
00:22:05,357 --> 00:22:08,694
There's all these Heineken Oompa Loompas
that cheer at you the whole time.

459
00:22:09,795 --> 00:22:11,563
Then you find out
they're not Oompa Loompas.

460
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:13,565
They're children
with fetal alcohol syndrome.

461
00:22:13,632 --> 00:22:15,634
[audience laughing]

462
00:22:17,536 --> 00:22:18,704
Yeah.

463
00:22:19,404 --> 00:22:20,872
They were yelling, "My mom drank beer!"

464
00:22:20,939 --> 00:22:24,076
And you're like,
"She sure did, sport. She sure did.

465
00:22:25,077 --> 00:22:27,045
What are you, 32 now? That's great.

466
00:22:27,846 --> 00:22:30,015
Give me a high-two with that claw,
all right."

467
00:22:30,082 --> 00:22:32,084
[audience laughing]

468
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:37,889
My friend was like, "Why do you have to go
in the Anne Frank House?"

469
00:22:37,956 --> 00:22:38,890
I'm like, "I'm a Jew,

470
00:22:38,957 --> 00:22:41,693
and I don't think I'm allowed to not to go
to the Anne Frank House."

471
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:45,697
And he was like, "Well, I'm not a Jew,
and I don't wanna go with you."

472
00:22:45,764 --> 00:22:47,766
I'm like,
"Yeah, you're making the right decision."

473
00:22:49,468 --> 00:22:52,070
So, we split up. He went to Heineken,
I went to Anne Frank.

474
00:22:52,137 --> 00:22:54,539
First we had lunch.
Right next to the Anne Frank House

475
00:22:54,606 --> 00:22:56,742
there's this restaurant
with really good grilled cheese.

476
00:22:57,642 --> 00:22:58,610
Yeah.

477
00:22:58,677 --> 00:23:00,479
-No joke, just...
-[audience laughs]

478
00:23:00,545 --> 00:23:02,147
You don't have to go
to the Anne Frank House,

479
00:23:02,414 --> 00:23:04,983
but like right next
to the Anne Frank House, check it out.

480
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:07,486
It's like Anne Frank, right there.
It was awesome.

481
00:23:07,552 --> 00:23:10,455
It was probably the best
grilled-cheese sandwich I've ever had.

482
00:23:10,522 --> 00:23:12,390
It has five different kinds of cheeses.

483
00:23:12,457 --> 00:23:14,793
Mashed tomato.
Honestly, guys, do yourself a favor.

484
00:23:15,694 --> 00:23:17,429
Check out that grilled-cheese place.

485
00:23:19,664 --> 00:23:22,567
Then I went to the Anne Frank house.
It was this two-hour tour.

486
00:23:22,634 --> 00:23:25,871
They take you through the whole thing.
All the floors and rooms.

487
00:23:25,937 --> 00:23:28,507
And, uh, he was right. It was a downer.

488
00:23:29,641 --> 00:23:31,510
It was not a fun experience
in any way.

489
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:35,013
Every time I go to museums like that,
I think it's not gonna get me.

490
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:36,948
Then it does.
It always fucking gets me.

491
00:23:37,015 --> 00:23:38,884
When I got back to my place in New York,

492
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:40,819
I kept thinking about Anne Frank.

493
00:23:40,886 --> 00:23:43,622
I kept thinking about the Anne Frank House
and the way she lived,

494
00:23:44,189 --> 00:23:46,525
and the more I thought about it,
the more I realized...

495
00:23:47,793 --> 00:23:50,495
I can already tell you guys
are not gonna go with me on this.

496
00:23:50,562 --> 00:23:52,731
[audience laughs]

497
00:23:52,798 --> 00:23:55,033
Anne Frank didn't live that bad, you guys.

498
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:57,102
[audience laughs]

499
00:23:58,470 --> 00:24:01,706
You weren't there. I was there.
Don't believe what the media tells you.

500
00:24:02,174 --> 00:24:03,775
It wasn't that bad at all.

501
00:24:04,910 --> 00:24:06,011
Here's how I know:

502
00:24:06,077 --> 00:24:08,847
I got my first place in New York,
an apartment in New York.

503
00:24:08,914 --> 00:24:11,583
And a girl at the time came over,
and she's like:

504
00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:13,819
"Give me the tour of your place."
That's normal.

505
00:24:13,885 --> 00:24:16,221
I was like, "Sure. Okay, well... uh...

506
00:24:16,488 --> 00:24:18,490
[audience chuckling]

507
00:24:19,991 --> 00:24:21,626
Uh, all right.

508
00:24:22,627 --> 00:24:23,795
Well, there's the kitchen.

509
00:24:24,663 --> 00:24:26,865
It's pretty much just part
of this room, but...

510
00:24:26,965 --> 00:24:30,836
That's where the fridge and the stove are,
so, we call that wall the kitchen.

511
00:24:34,239 --> 00:24:36,007
Uh, couch is over there.

512
00:24:36,842 --> 00:24:39,244
You might see it as a bed,
but it's daytime right now,

513
00:24:39,511 --> 00:24:40,946
so, it's called a couch this hour.

514
00:24:43,048 --> 00:24:45,483
Bathroom's there.
If you want to brush your teeth,

515
00:24:45,550 --> 00:24:47,552
I suggest sliding the shower door open

516
00:24:47,619 --> 00:24:49,120
so you can get full extension.

517
00:24:49,187 --> 00:24:51,256
Otherwise you're gonna have
to brush like that.

518
00:24:51,823 --> 00:24:53,859
That's your choice.
However you want to play that.

519
00:24:55,093 --> 00:24:56,027
And, uh...

520
00:24:58,530 --> 00:25:00,031
Yeah. That's it. Ta-da.

521
00:25:00,565 --> 00:25:01,233
That's the tour.

522
00:25:04,703 --> 00:25:07,939
The Anne Frank tour took two hours.

523
00:25:08,006 --> 00:25:10,008
[audience laughs]

524
00:25:10,909 --> 00:25:13,044
She lived so much better than I live.

525
00:25:14,145 --> 00:25:15,981
Plus that grilled-cheese place next door?

526
00:25:16,047 --> 00:25:17,816
[audience laughing]

527
00:25:17,883 --> 00:25:19,517
That had to come in handy.

528
00:25:20,185 --> 00:25:22,687
During the Holocaust?
That's comfort food, you guys.

529
00:25:24,522 --> 00:25:26,625
What better time for comfort food
than the Holocaust?

530
00:25:27,058 --> 00:25:28,760
She was probably there every day.

531
00:25:29,961 --> 00:25:31,229
Every night. Probably every night.

532
00:25:31,296 --> 00:25:32,731
[audience laughs]

533
00:25:32,797 --> 00:25:34,799
Probably not a daytime order
for Anne Frank.

534
00:25:35,667 --> 00:25:36,668
She was probably like:

535
00:25:39,170 --> 00:25:40,538
"Give me a grilled cheese.

536
00:25:42,073 --> 00:25:43,275
Come on, hurry up."

537
00:25:44,242 --> 00:25:45,810
It's grilled enough. Let's go."

538
00:25:45,877 --> 00:25:47,178
[audience laughs]

539
00:25:48,613 --> 00:25:50,015
They'd be like, "Is that to go?"

540
00:25:50,081 --> 00:25:51,583
"To go, every time!

541
00:25:52,183 --> 00:25:54,019
I cannot eat here. Hurry up!"

542
00:25:54,085 --> 00:25:56,154
[audience laughing]

543
00:25:59,925 --> 00:26:03,028
I like to imagine Anne Frank
getting upstairs going, "Oh, phew,"

544
00:26:03,128 --> 00:26:04,863
with, like, her bag of grilled cheese.

545
00:26:05,130 --> 00:26:07,132
Her friends are like,
"You brought grilled cheese?"

546
00:26:07,198 --> 00:26:08,867
And she'd be like, "Oh, did you guys...?

547
00:26:10,335 --> 00:26:12,304
Did you want some?
You should have said something.

548
00:26:12,570 --> 00:26:13,772
I would have brought you some.

549
00:26:15,774 --> 00:26:16,975
What did you eat instead?

550
00:26:17,042 --> 00:26:19,311
Oh. Wallpaper glue? Again?

551
00:26:20,578 --> 00:26:22,714
They had tater tots.
You should have said something.

552
00:26:22,781 --> 00:26:24,249
I'd have totally gotten you some."

553
00:26:24,316 --> 00:26:26,318
[audience chuckling]

554
00:26:29,721 --> 00:26:31,690
I can't wait for my father
to hate that joke.

555
00:26:31,756 --> 00:26:33,124
[audience laughs]

556
00:26:34,926 --> 00:26:38,330
I've been to a bunch of places this year.
I went to Thailand last year, too.

557
00:26:38,596 --> 00:26:39,264
Last April.

558
00:26:39,331 --> 00:26:40,999
A year ago in April I went to Thailand.

559
00:26:41,066 --> 00:26:43,702
-It was fun. You guys ever been there?
-[audience members cheers]

560
00:26:43,768 --> 00:26:46,004
A couple of you? It's cheap.
It's third world.

561
00:26:46,671 --> 00:26:48,206
I mean, it's so cheap, you guys.

562
00:26:48,273 --> 00:26:51,309
You ever go to a country
and do conversion math in your head?

563
00:26:51,376 --> 00:26:53,278
Like their currency to dollars?

564
00:26:53,345 --> 00:26:55,780
I was doing that.
I was buying a beer in Thailand,

565
00:26:55,847 --> 00:26:58,616
and I was trying to figure out
how much it was in dollars.

566
00:26:58,683 --> 00:27:01,186
My friend was like, "It's free.
Everything here is free."

567
00:27:01,252 --> 00:27:03,254
[audience laughing]

568
00:27:04,990 --> 00:27:06,057
[chuckles]

569
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:10,862
You hand them some orange money
and they give you beers for five weeks

570
00:27:10,929 --> 00:27:12,063
until you leave.

571
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:13,965
And they build a statue in your honor.

572
00:27:14,032 --> 00:27:16,034
[audience laughing]

573
00:27:18,203 --> 00:27:20,672
Everything's such--
And you can bargain, too.

574
00:27:20,739 --> 00:27:23,074
Craziest thing.
You can bargain over almost anything.

575
00:27:23,141 --> 00:27:24,709
I went to buy a shirt once,

576
00:27:24,776 --> 00:27:27,078
this shirt I liked,
and I asked how much it cost.

577
00:27:27,145 --> 00:27:29,014
It was 200 baht. That's their currency.

578
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:30,415
B-A-H-T.

579
00:27:30,682 --> 00:27:32,150
But he didn't tell me 200 baht.

580
00:27:32,217 --> 00:27:33,418
He took out a calculator,

581
00:27:34,052 --> 00:27:38,123
and he typed 200 on the calculator,

582
00:27:38,823 --> 00:27:41,426
and then he handed me the calculator.

583
00:27:43,328 --> 00:27:44,929
And I took it, and I was like...

584
00:27:44,996 --> 00:27:46,998
[audience laughing]

585
00:27:51,302 --> 00:27:53,271
I was like, "Why are we involving this?

586
00:27:56,074 --> 00:27:58,376
Are you trying to show me
where all the calculators went?"

587
00:28:02,047 --> 00:28:03,448
I was like, "Are we bargaining?"

588
00:28:03,715 --> 00:28:06,051
So, I just tried something.
I was like, "I don't know."

589
00:28:06,117 --> 00:28:09,387
So, I typed, "Minus 125...

590
00:28:10,955 --> 00:28:11,856
equals..."

591
00:28:12,257 --> 00:28:15,393
and then I handed him back
the calculator.

592
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:17,462
[audience laughing]

593
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:25,837
And he took it and he was like, "Puh."
He was like, "Plus 90."

594
00:28:25,904 --> 00:28:27,205
And he gave it back to me.

595
00:28:27,272 --> 00:28:29,707
I was like, "Minus 70,"
and I gave it back to him.

596
00:28:29,774 --> 00:28:32,210
We keep going back and forth like that.
That's what you do.

597
00:28:32,277 --> 00:28:34,946
That's what you do. Until you get
some number you can't live with.

598
00:28:35,013 --> 00:28:38,316
You're like, "I'll walk. I'll walk
the fuck out of here right now.

599
00:28:38,383 --> 00:28:40,819
If you think I'm going 1 baht over 150,

600
00:28:40,885 --> 00:28:42,387
you're out of your goddamn mind!"

601
00:28:42,454 --> 00:28:44,456
[audience laughing]

602
00:28:48,493 --> 00:28:51,463
Then he's like, "Fine, 150 baht."
"That's right, motherfucker.

603
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:52,464
I'm no sucker."

604
00:28:53,998 --> 00:28:57,068
And then you realize you've been
bargaining for ten minutes over 31 cents.

605
00:28:57,135 --> 00:28:59,104
[audience laughing and clapping]

606
00:29:03,475 --> 00:29:04,342
Yeah.

607
00:29:05,744 --> 00:29:08,880
Thirty-one cents, which he could have used
to feed his family on for four days.

608
00:29:09,214 --> 00:29:11,816
But you're like,
"Not my problem. First world."

609
00:29:11,883 --> 00:29:13,952
[audience laughing]

610
00:29:14,018 --> 00:29:16,020
[audience whistling and applauding]

611
00:29:17,122 --> 00:29:18,757
This one's tough. I, uh...

612
00:29:20,024 --> 00:29:21,526
I think I'm a homophobe, you guys.

613
00:29:22,827 --> 00:29:25,230
Yeah. I don't want to be homophobic,
but I think I am.

614
00:29:25,330 --> 00:29:27,198
My gay friend accused me
of being homophobic.

615
00:29:27,866 --> 00:29:28,967
Gay Andrew, we call him.

616
00:29:29,033 --> 00:29:31,035
[audience laughing]

617
00:29:31,536 --> 00:29:34,239
That's not why.
That's got nothing to do with this.

618
00:29:34,305 --> 00:29:37,175
He signed off on that nickname.
We had two Andrews in my dorm.

619
00:29:37,242 --> 00:29:38,877
We had to separate them somehow.

620
00:29:39,511 --> 00:29:41,446
So, it was Gay Andrew
and Straight Andrew.

621
00:29:43,047 --> 00:29:46,484
Or if you got to know them, if you were
in the crew, Gandrew and Strandrew.

622
00:29:49,521 --> 00:29:50,889
You know what was worse?

623
00:29:50,955 --> 00:29:53,458
We had three different guys
from China in my dorm named Wei.

624
00:29:54,225 --> 00:29:55,994
W-E-I. You know what we called them?

625
00:29:56,828 --> 00:29:59,264
Wei One, Wei Two, and Wei Three.

626
00:30:00,064 --> 00:30:02,200
[laughs] Wei Three hated it.

627
00:30:02,567 --> 00:30:03,568
He hated it.

628
00:30:04,102 --> 00:30:06,805
Like, "Why do I gotta be Wei Three?"
"Shut up, Wei Three!

629
00:30:06,871 --> 00:30:09,574
You asshole. Come on, Wei One.
I'm sorry you had to hear that."

630
00:30:09,841 --> 00:30:11,843
[audience laughing]

631
00:30:16,214 --> 00:30:18,216
Gandrew and Strandrew,
and this happened, like...

632
00:30:19,117 --> 00:30:20,518
three years after college.

633
00:30:20,585 --> 00:30:22,487
We were all at a bar.
We were drinking.

634
00:30:22,554 --> 00:30:24,289
It was 11:00. We left this bar.

635
00:30:24,355 --> 00:30:27,125
"What should we do next?"
And so, Gandrew's like:

636
00:30:27,192 --> 00:30:28,893
"You know what we should do now?"

637
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:31,229
I was like, "What?"
He goes, "Let's go to my place.

638
00:30:31,296 --> 00:30:32,363
We can totally fuck."

639
00:30:33,898 --> 00:30:35,133
It's like, "Wait, what?

640
00:30:36,301 --> 00:30:38,036
Did you just try to slip in a fuck?"

641
00:30:38,102 --> 00:30:40,205
[audience laughing]

642
00:30:40,271 --> 00:30:43,007
And he's like, "Did you notice?"
Like, "Yes, I noticed.

643
00:30:43,575 --> 00:30:45,143
Absolutely, but I'll tell you:

644
00:30:45,210 --> 00:30:48,213
Even if I didn't notice now,
I would have noticed later,

645
00:30:48,947 --> 00:30:50,148
when you tried to fuck."

646
00:30:53,585 --> 00:30:56,855
He was like, "I'll never stop trying."
"That's fine. I don't care."

647
00:30:56,921 --> 00:30:59,324
At that point, he'd been hitting on me
for five years.

648
00:30:59,390 --> 00:31:02,360
All through college and then some.
I didn't mind, you know?

649
00:31:02,427 --> 00:31:05,096
It's flattering, and I'm stronger
than him, so, who cares?

650
00:31:05,163 --> 00:31:06,898
[audience laughing]

651
00:31:06,965 --> 00:31:09,367
You know? It's all the benefit,
none of the danger.

652
00:31:12,036 --> 00:31:14,138
But he was getting mad, you guys.
He was mad.

653
00:31:14,205 --> 00:31:17,342
When you hit on someone for five years
and don't get anywhere, it's frustrating.

654
00:31:17,408 --> 00:31:19,577
I've never-- I can't imagine
being in that situation.

655
00:31:19,644 --> 00:31:22,347
Not get anywhere.
And he lost it that night.

656
00:31:22,413 --> 00:31:23,548
Couldn't take it anymore.

657
00:31:23,615 --> 00:31:25,450
He just goes, "Ari."
Just right at me:

658
00:31:25,516 --> 00:31:26,918
"Why won't you fuck me?"

659
00:31:27,452 --> 00:31:30,288
Yeah, just blatant like that.
Jesus Christ.

660
00:31:30,355 --> 00:31:33,892
Is that what women deal with all the time?
Like, "Why won't you fuck me?"

661
00:31:33,958 --> 00:31:35,960
And I was like, "'Cause I'm not gay."

662
00:31:36,394 --> 00:31:38,529
I'm telling you,
if a gay guy's hitting on you

663
00:31:38,596 --> 00:31:43,034
and you tell him you're not gay, that is
not a good enough answer for a gay man.

664
00:31:43,101 --> 00:31:44,535
[audience laughs]

665
00:31:44,602 --> 00:31:47,005
You'd think that'd end the argument.
It does not.

666
00:31:47,071 --> 00:31:48,306
It only changes it slightly.

667
00:31:50,174 --> 00:31:52,510
He goes, "How do you know?"

668
00:31:54,379 --> 00:31:56,481
Like he's gonna outthink me
right there on the spot.

669
00:31:57,282 --> 00:31:59,217
He's gonna logic his way
into my asshole.

670
00:31:59,284 --> 00:32:01,419
[audience laughing]

671
00:32:01,486 --> 00:32:04,088
I was like, "Is that really a question?
How do I know?

672
00:32:04,155 --> 00:32:06,391
How do I know I'm not gay?
I don't know, man.

673
00:32:06,457 --> 00:32:08,159
I guess I've always sort of suspected.

674
00:32:09,527 --> 00:32:10,461
Is that the answer?

675
00:32:11,529 --> 00:32:13,298
I remember when I was young, like 13,

676
00:32:13,364 --> 00:32:15,233
I remember seeing a love scene in a movie.

677
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:17,435
I remember looking at the woman
the whole time.

678
00:32:18,336 --> 00:32:20,405
And right there I was like,
'Oh, fuck, maybe.'

679
00:32:22,173 --> 00:32:25,576
Later, I remember, the  Sports Illustrated
swimsuit issue came to my house.

680
00:32:26,311 --> 00:32:28,446
Before anybody else got it,
I took it to my room.

681
00:32:29,213 --> 00:32:30,448
And I masturbated to it.

682
00:32:31,349 --> 00:32:32,383
Until I came.

683
00:32:34,385 --> 00:32:36,087
And that was my second clue.

684
00:32:36,154 --> 00:32:38,156
[audience laughing]

685
00:32:40,558 --> 00:32:44,162
After a while I just came to terms
with it. I just realized who I was.

686
00:32:44,963 --> 00:32:47,565
And I told everybody in my life.
I told my mom, my dad.

687
00:32:48,232 --> 00:32:50,301
I sat them all down.
I was like, 'Guys, I'm...

688
00:32:51,502 --> 00:32:52,704
I'm a heterosexual.'

689
00:32:52,971 --> 00:32:54,973
[audience laughing]

690
00:32:55,039 --> 00:32:56,274
[audience member cheers]

691
00:32:56,341 --> 00:32:58,443
To be honest, Gandrew,
everybody's been cool about it.

692
00:32:58,509 --> 00:33:00,511
You're the only one giving me a hard time.

693
00:33:03,081 --> 00:33:06,417
Everybody else knows I was born this way.
It's not a choice or a decision.

694
00:33:08,052 --> 00:33:10,722
They've all been very respectful
of who I am, except for you."

695
00:33:12,323 --> 00:33:15,226
Then he goes, "Okay, that's fair.
That's fair. You're right. My bad."

696
00:33:15,293 --> 00:33:16,461
But he wasn't done trying.

697
00:33:17,362 --> 00:33:18,663
He was like, "How about this?"

698
00:33:18,730 --> 00:33:20,565
He goes, "Let's go back to my place--"

699
00:33:20,631 --> 00:33:23,501
"Andrew, come on."
"No, just hear me out. Just wait, okay?

700
00:33:23,568 --> 00:33:25,236
It's okay, shh, it's okay.

701
00:33:25,303 --> 00:33:28,306
We'll just go back to my place,
and I'll just blow you."

702
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:31,142
And I was like, "No."

703
00:33:32,377 --> 00:33:35,079
And man, he could not accept that at all.

704
00:33:35,146 --> 00:33:37,215
He was like,
"You won't even let me blow you?

705
00:33:37,281 --> 00:33:39,617
Are you kidding?
You aren't gonna let me blow you?"

706
00:33:40,251 --> 00:33:42,286
And I was like, "No."
And he was like, "Why?!"

707
00:33:43,087 --> 00:33:45,423
And I'm like,
"'Cause I'm not attracted to men."

708
00:33:45,490 --> 00:33:48,626
He goes, "Yeah, but, Ari, I've seen
a lot of the women you've hooked up with.

709
00:33:48,693 --> 00:33:50,428
[audience laughing]

710
00:33:50,495 --> 00:33:52,563
And you're not attracted
to a lot of them either."

711
00:33:53,197 --> 00:33:55,299
I was like,
"Well, touché, Gandrew. Touché."

712
00:33:56,334 --> 00:33:58,202
I get too drunk. It happens. Absolutely.

713
00:33:58,736 --> 00:34:01,806
And he goes, "So, shall we fuck?"
And I'm like, "No. We shall'n't."

714
00:34:02,073 --> 00:34:04,075
[audience laughing]

715
00:34:05,643 --> 00:34:07,378
He goes,
"That's 'cause you're homophobic."

716
00:34:07,712 --> 00:34:10,548
I'm like, "What? I'm homophobic
'cause I won't let you fuck me?"

717
00:34:11,249 --> 00:34:14,485
And he goes, "No, no. You're homophobic
'cause you won't let me blow you."

718
00:34:16,087 --> 00:34:17,822
I was like, "Please explain."

719
00:34:19,357 --> 00:34:20,525
And he goes, "Okay. Sure."

720
00:34:20,591 --> 00:34:23,361
He asks me some questions.
He goes, "Do you like blow jobs?"

721
00:34:23,428 --> 00:34:24,462
I was like, "Yes. I do."

722
00:34:24,796 --> 00:34:27,532
I've always-- My entire career,
I've always voted pro-blow job.

723
00:34:28,599 --> 00:34:31,202
I'm like Bernie Sanders and Ron Paul.
Down the middle.

724
00:34:31,269 --> 00:34:32,837
Never waffled on the main issues.

725
00:34:33,104 --> 00:34:35,073
Always voted yes on Prop Beej.

726
00:34:35,139 --> 00:34:37,141
[audience laughing]

727
00:34:38,643 --> 00:34:42,346
Yeah. And he's like, "Great. Okay.
Well, I enjoy giving them."

728
00:34:43,147 --> 00:34:44,082
I was like, "So?"

729
00:34:44,148 --> 00:34:47,452
He goes, "So, you want something,
and I have that thing."

730
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:52,256
I was like, "I don't understand."
He goes, "Let's say you wanted a Kit-Kat.

731
00:34:52,557 --> 00:34:54,325
You didn't have any Kit-Kats.

732
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:59,430
You're like, 'I wish I could get a Kit-Kat
but it's so late and no stores are open.

733
00:34:59,497 --> 00:35:02,100
There's no place to get a Kit-Kat.
What am I gonna do?'

734
00:35:02,166 --> 00:35:03,801
Your old buddy Gandrew shows up,

735
00:35:05,269 --> 00:35:07,405
and he's got a knapsack full of Kit-Kats,

736
00:35:08,306 --> 00:35:10,141
and he's just looking to give one out.

737
00:35:11,275 --> 00:35:12,743
'Take one.' 'No. I don't want to.'

738
00:35:12,810 --> 00:35:14,479
'Take one. I love giving them out.

739
00:35:14,545 --> 00:35:17,148
It gives me some weird gratification
to hand out a Kit-Kat.'"

740
00:35:17,215 --> 00:35:19,550
[audience laughing]

741
00:35:19,617 --> 00:35:22,320
He goes, "You know what you do?"
"What?" "You take a Kit-Kat.

742
00:35:23,387 --> 00:35:24,455
You probably take a couple.

743
00:35:24,522 --> 00:35:26,724
You'd get annoying.
Next time I saw you, you'd be like:

744
00:35:26,791 --> 00:35:28,426
'Hey, can I get another Kit-Kat?'

745
00:35:28,493 --> 00:35:30,728
[audience laughing]

746
00:35:30,795 --> 00:35:35,700
I'd be like, 'We don't have time.'
'Let's go to the back and get one Kit-Kat.

747
00:35:35,766 --> 00:35:37,368
I don't see what the difference is.'"

748
00:35:37,802 --> 00:35:39,804
[audience chuckling]

749
00:35:40,338 --> 00:35:44,375
He goes, "You know why? 'Cause there's
no social stigma on a fucking Kit-Kat."

750
00:35:45,510 --> 00:35:48,713
And I'm like, "So, I'm a homophobe
because I won't let you blow me?"

751
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:51,149
He goes, "Yeah, that's right. You are."

752
00:35:52,283 --> 00:35:53,151
And I was like:

753
00:35:54,485 --> 00:35:56,521
"I gotta think about this, man.
I don't know.

754
00:35:56,587 --> 00:35:57,488
[audience laughing]

755
00:35:58,289 --> 00:36:00,158
What you're saying makes sense.

756
00:36:01,526 --> 00:36:04,862
I don't want to be homophobic.
I was a fucking liberal arts major.

757
00:36:06,497 --> 00:36:08,366
I can't be homophobic, but I think I am.

758
00:36:08,799 --> 00:36:12,236
I think I am. I've never let a dude
blow me. I've never fucked a dude."

759
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:14,705
It's stuck in my head.
That was 15 years ago,

760
00:36:14,772 --> 00:36:18,276
and it's stuck in the back of my head.
Every few months I'd think about it.

761
00:36:18,342 --> 00:36:21,212
Not all the time, but gay marriage
would come up as a topic.

762
00:36:21,279 --> 00:36:24,582
Everyone would weigh in. I'm like,
"Homophobe. You can't talk. Oh, yeah."

763
00:36:26,217 --> 00:36:27,652
I can't be part of this dialogue.

764
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:31,322
Yeah, it bothered me for so long.

765
00:36:31,923 --> 00:36:34,725
I mean, I've stuck my dick
in horrible places.

766
00:36:34,792 --> 00:36:36,394
[audience laughs]

767
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:37,461
Just horrible.

768
00:36:38,396 --> 00:36:39,564
But never a man.

769
00:36:40,831 --> 00:36:43,768
And I mean horrible.
I mean, like, I fucked a couch before.

770
00:36:43,834 --> 00:36:46,337
[audience laughs]

771
00:36:46,404 --> 00:36:48,639
Yeah. You know whose couch?
Worst person possible.

772
00:36:48,706 --> 00:36:50,308
My Mommy and Daddy's couch.

773
00:36:50,374 --> 00:36:51,442
[audience laughs]

774
00:36:52,643 --> 00:36:54,278
Yeah, the blue one in the living room.

775
00:36:54,612 --> 00:36:56,914
I went in there
between Seat Cushion 2 and 3.

776
00:36:56,981 --> 00:36:59,383
I would get in there
and I would just fucking-- Just:

777
00:37:00,484 --> 00:37:02,954
I would hold the cushion tight
so it would feel better.

778
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:05,356
I would hook my ankle
in the other one, like...

779
00:37:05,423 --> 00:37:06,290
And bring it in.

780
00:37:07,592 --> 00:37:09,493
That's how I'd get off
to that swimsuit issue.

781
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:11,462
I'd fucking look at Rachel Hunter,
and I'm like:

782
00:37:11,696 --> 00:37:13,698
[audience laughing]

783
00:37:16,467 --> 00:37:19,303
Do you know how good it felt
to fuck that couch as a 15-year-old?

784
00:37:19,370 --> 00:37:21,472
Do you know how--?
Awful, you guys. It felt awful.

785
00:37:21,539 --> 00:37:22,573
[audience laughs]

786
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:23,674
It would chafe my dick.

787
00:37:23,741 --> 00:37:26,010
You're not supposed to fuck couches.
You know that?

788
00:37:26,677 --> 00:37:28,779
They're not for fucking.
They're for sitting on. Yeah.

789
00:37:29,247 --> 00:37:30,815
Maybe that should be
on a Snapple bottle.

790
00:37:31,916 --> 00:37:35,753
The original function of a couch was not
for 15-year-olds to explore themselves.

791
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:37,622
They're just for sitting on.

792
00:37:37,688 --> 00:37:40,358
Yeah, it would chafe my dick
almost to the point of bleeding.

793
00:37:40,758 --> 00:37:41,726
Yeah.

794
00:37:41,792 --> 00:37:43,527
Maybe that's how
I got the cut on my dick.

795
00:37:43,594 --> 00:37:44,895
[audience laughs]

796
00:37:44,962 --> 00:37:47,431
Maybe that was it.
Maybe that's the original wound.

797
00:37:48,733 --> 00:37:50,368
It took me like a week to heal.

798
00:37:51,402 --> 00:37:53,337
You know what I did
as soon as I was done?

799
00:37:53,871 --> 00:37:55,506
Yeah, I was right back in there.

800
00:37:55,906 --> 00:37:58,509
"You thought I was gone?
I'll never be gone. I own you.

801
00:37:58,576 --> 00:37:59,610
You're mine."

802
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:04,515
I've fucked a couch
and I've never fucked a man.

803
00:38:05,483 --> 00:38:07,718
I was like, "Maybe I'm a homophobe.
Maybe it's true."

804
00:38:08,052 --> 00:38:10,755
I always thought, like, no,
I wasn't attracted to a man.

805
00:38:10,821 --> 00:38:12,523
But maybe I'm wrong.

806
00:38:12,990 --> 00:38:14,925
And then, last April...

807
00:38:15,893 --> 00:38:17,361
I took that trip to Thailand.

808
00:38:17,828 --> 00:38:19,830
[audience laughing]

809
00:38:20,865 --> 00:38:22,366
Some of you are ahead of me.

810
00:38:24,001 --> 00:38:25,569
I haven't gotten there yet, you guys.

811
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:31,776
My friends all asked me
the same question when I got back.

812
00:38:31,842 --> 00:38:34,612
None of them asked me about the food,
the amazing cuisine.

813
00:38:34,679 --> 00:38:36,881
None of them asked me
about the temples every four blocks.

814
00:38:37,481 --> 00:38:41,085
The only question they had:
"Ari, did you fuck a ladyboy?"

815
00:38:41,352 --> 00:38:42,620
[audience laughs]

816
00:38:42,687 --> 00:38:43,954
That's all they wanted to know.

817
00:38:44,422 --> 00:38:46,590
And I was going to, you guys.
I was for real.

818
00:38:46,657 --> 00:38:48,426
That was the plan.
That was the plan.

819
00:38:48,859 --> 00:38:50,361
Do you guys know what a ladyboy is?

820
00:38:50,594 --> 00:38:53,030
-[audience members] Yes.
-Okay. If you don't, it's a transsexual.

821
00:38:53,097 --> 00:38:55,766
But it's better than that.
It's regional. They dominate.

822
00:38:55,833 --> 00:38:56,967
[audience laughs]

823
00:38:57,034 --> 00:38:58,703
They're like the best of the best.

824
00:38:59,337 --> 00:39:02,840
The Thai ladyboy is like
the '92 Dream Team of transsexuals.

825
00:39:02,907 --> 00:39:04,909
[audience laughing]

826
00:39:05,576 --> 00:39:07,545
Yeah, and just like the '92 Dream Team,

827
00:39:07,611 --> 00:39:09,547
only one out of 12 of them have AIDS.

828
00:39:09,613 --> 00:39:11,882
[audience] Oh!

829
00:39:11,949 --> 00:39:13,851
[audience laughing and clapping]

830
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:17,722
What are you guys, Magic fans? Relax.

831
00:39:20,658 --> 00:39:23,928
And I was going to. I was for real
going to. I was gonna fuck a ladyboy.

832
00:39:23,994 --> 00:39:26,497
Because no, guys,
I'm not attracted to men. I'm not.

833
00:39:26,564 --> 00:39:28,899
But I am attracted
to hot-looking women

834
00:39:28,966 --> 00:39:31,669
who happen to have one weird detail
about them.

835
00:39:31,736 --> 00:39:33,738
[audience laughing]

836
00:39:35,072 --> 00:39:38,542
That's a whole different thing.
And they are hot. They're hot, you guys.

837
00:39:38,609 --> 00:39:40,678
They're hot.
From behind, you can't tell.

838
00:39:40,745 --> 00:39:42,913
From behind, they're like petite.

839
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:44,548
They're like 5'3"...

840
00:39:44,615 --> 00:39:46,550
Asian men, but they're, like, small.

841
00:39:46,617 --> 00:39:48,552
They wear black miniskirt dresses,

842
00:39:48,619 --> 00:39:52,590
so, their asses and legs look good.
They've got long, straight Asian hair.

843
00:39:52,990 --> 00:39:54,492
The kind Jewish women buy.

844
00:39:54,925 --> 00:39:56,093
[audience laughs]

845
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:57,128
You know?

846
00:39:57,395 --> 00:40:00,631
You come up behind them like,
"Goddamn, she's hot as fuck. Who's that?"

847
00:40:01,132 --> 00:40:03,667
And then you look in front,
they got breast implants,

848
00:40:03,734 --> 00:40:06,771
and they tuck their dicks with,
like, industrial-grade jockstraps.

849
00:40:07,872 --> 00:40:08,973
The best of the best.

850
00:40:09,039 --> 00:40:11,876
And you look at them
from below the Adam's apple down,

851
00:40:13,677 --> 00:40:15,713
and you're like,
"She's so hot. So is she."

852
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:17,982
Then you look up.
You're like, "Hello, sir. Gentlemen.

853
00:40:18,649 --> 00:40:20,618
Fellas. How you guys doing?
What's up, bro? Dude?"

854
00:40:20,684 --> 00:40:21,685
[audience laughing]

855
00:40:22,686 --> 00:40:25,723
Yeah, the people who say they're tens
definitely fucked a ladyboy.

856
00:40:26,624 --> 00:40:27,992
And I wanted to, you guys.

857
00:40:28,058 --> 00:40:31,929
Why not? What better place to dip my toe
into the waters of homosexuality

858
00:40:32,797 --> 00:40:34,765
just to see how it feels,
you know what I mean?

859
00:40:34,832 --> 00:40:38,035
You don't want your first gay experience
when you're wondering whether you should--

860
00:40:38,102 --> 00:40:40,671
You don't want your first experience
to be some buff dude

861
00:40:41,071 --> 00:40:43,140
who comes in like,
"I'm gonna tear that ass apart!"

862
00:40:43,207 --> 00:40:46,744
"I'm out, I'm out, I'm out. I can't do it.
I thought I could. I apologize.

863
00:40:46,811 --> 00:40:49,713
I'll pay for dinner. Get an appetizer.
I apologize. I can't do this."

864
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:51,549
[audience chuckles]

865
00:40:51,615 --> 00:40:54,819
You gotta start small and work
your way up. The ladyboy, you know?

866
00:40:54,885 --> 00:40:56,754
It's like the marijuana of gay.

867
00:40:56,821 --> 00:40:58,155
[audience laughing]

868
00:40:59,490 --> 00:41:00,925
And why not Thailand? Why not?

869
00:41:00,991 --> 00:41:03,828
They don't talk a lot of English.
They have a low Facebook presence.

870
00:41:06,230 --> 00:41:07,631
What better place?

871
00:41:08,032 --> 00:41:10,100
If I could do it,
if I could fuck one ladyboy,

872
00:41:10,167 --> 00:41:12,203
I could prove to myself
that I wasn't a homophobe.

873
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:15,673
You know? Once and for all.
I just wasn't attracted to Gay Andrew.

874
00:41:16,974 --> 00:41:19,643
Ladyboys are different.
I was like, "I'm gonna do this."

875
00:41:19,710 --> 00:41:23,047
If I can do it, I can do all the stuff
that I want to do in the world.

876
00:41:23,113 --> 00:41:25,549
You know what I want to do?
I'm gonna open myself up.

877
00:41:25,616 --> 00:41:28,886
I wanted to get five to come
with me to a Thai kickboxing fight.

878
00:41:29,987 --> 00:41:32,857
They're like 15 bucks for the whole day.
For 75 dollars,

879
00:41:32,923 --> 00:41:36,093
you can get five of them. I was gonna get
a mink coat and walk in like this:

880
00:41:36,727 --> 00:41:38,929
[audience laughing]

881
00:41:38,996 --> 00:41:40,264
[audience member cheers]

882
00:41:42,633 --> 00:41:43,868
First I had to get my dick wet.

883
00:41:44,935 --> 00:41:47,137
You know, so, I went into one
of the massage parlors.

884
00:41:47,204 --> 00:41:49,173
They all start crowding around me.

885
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:52,776
Like, "Ladies, ladies, fellas, whatever,
back off, give me some room here.

886
00:41:52,843 --> 00:41:55,579
Let me breathe. This is my first time.
I'm not a regular."

887
00:41:55,646 --> 00:41:57,581
So, they all moved away.
Super respectful.

888
00:41:58,115 --> 00:41:59,550
There's 40 of them in there.

889
00:41:59,884 --> 00:42:01,585
Two of them were legitimately hot.

890
00:42:01,919 --> 00:42:03,721
Two of them-- Nobody could tell.

891
00:42:03,787 --> 00:42:05,756
Any guy here would buy them
multiple drinks

892
00:42:05,823 --> 00:42:07,725
to try to get with them. So fucking hot.

893
00:42:07,791 --> 00:42:10,294
And then there was a third one
that was, like, way older.

894
00:42:11,695 --> 00:42:13,597
You know, she was like a ladyman.

895
00:42:13,664 --> 00:42:15,666
[audience laughing]

896
00:42:16,767 --> 00:42:19,703
She had gray chest hair in her bikini top.
It was unsettling.

897
00:42:24,241 --> 00:42:26,911
I was like, "Hang up the jockstrap.
Your career's over."

898
00:42:29,747 --> 00:42:32,917
So, one of the "hot" hot ones
saw me looking at her, so, she comes over,

899
00:42:32,983 --> 00:42:35,052
she takes my hand,
she starts leading me back.

900
00:42:35,119 --> 00:42:38,722
I'm like, "Oh, fuck, I'm doing this.
I'm doing this. This is happening."

901
00:42:38,789 --> 00:42:42,660
We go to the back, through this curtain.
My heart's beating out of my chest.

902
00:42:42,726 --> 00:42:44,962
I was so nervous.
We start going up these steps.

903
00:42:45,029 --> 00:42:47,898
I went up two steps and my whole body
just kind of stopped.

904
00:42:47,965 --> 00:42:48,966
I just seized up.

905
00:42:49,333 --> 00:42:52,002
She looked back like, "What's the matter?"
And I was like:

906
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:54,905
"I'm homophobic.

907
00:42:55,339 --> 00:42:57,341
[audience laughing]

908
00:42:58,275 --> 00:43:00,611
Fuck. For sure, yeah.
I'm a homophobe."

909
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:06,083
She's like, "You're not attracted?"
"I'm super attracted. You're hot as fuck.

910
00:43:06,150 --> 00:43:09,019
But I can't do it."
Then she was like, "What's a homophobe?"

911
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:13,290
I'm like, how do you explain
to a ladyboy hooker in Thailand

912
00:43:14,325 --> 00:43:16,260
what homophobia is?

913
00:43:16,327 --> 00:43:19,229
It's such an open society.
And I was like, "All right well,

914
00:43:19,730 --> 00:43:20,864
let me try, I guess.

915
00:43:21,231 --> 00:43:24,802
A homophobe is like,
imagine if you gave somebody a hamburger,

916
00:43:25,202 --> 00:43:27,705
and they were eating it,
and halfway through,

917
00:43:27,771 --> 00:43:30,341
you were like, 'Actually,
just so you know, it's a veggie burger.'

918
00:43:30,874 --> 00:43:33,978
Then imagine they started
spitting out what they had in their mouth.

919
00:43:34,044 --> 00:43:36,013
And they're wiping their tongue
with a napkin,

920
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:39,650
and maybe they start punching the burger
'cause they're so mad at it,

921
00:43:39,717 --> 00:43:42,386
and they tell it,
'If you tell anybody this, I'll kill you.'

922
00:43:42,653 --> 00:43:43,954
And then they hung themselves.

923
00:43:44,021 --> 00:43:46,190
They couldn't live with
eating a veggie burger."

924
00:43:48,325 --> 00:43:49,927
I'm like, "That's a homophobe."

925
00:43:51,161 --> 00:43:53,664
I'm like, "You look exactly
like a hamburger,

926
00:43:53,731 --> 00:43:56,233
and I bet you taste and smell
just like one, too,

927
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:58,869
but deep in my heart,
I know you're a veggie burger,

928
00:43:59,703 --> 00:44:01,338
and something's not letting me
eat it.

929
00:44:02,172 --> 00:44:03,407
And that is homophobia."

930
00:44:04,141 --> 00:44:05,876
[audience laughing]

931
00:44:05,943 --> 00:44:07,945
[audience applauding and cheering]

932
00:44:10,147 --> 00:44:11,015
Yeah.

933
00:44:11,782 --> 00:44:14,918
And then she goes, "Well, I don't
understand. Do you like blow jobs?"

934
00:44:14,985 --> 00:44:17,755
"Yes, I like blow jobs.
Why does everybody ask me this?

935
00:44:17,821 --> 00:44:19,323
Of course I like blow jobs."

936
00:44:19,390 --> 00:44:22,259
Do I have a no-blow-job-liking face?
What is this question?

937
00:44:23,794 --> 00:44:25,663
She was like,
"I'm really good at them."

938
00:44:25,729 --> 00:44:28,065
I'm like, "Yeah, I mean,
you've gone pro, obviously."

939
00:44:28,132 --> 00:44:30,067
[audience laughing]

940
00:44:30,134 --> 00:44:34,171
I don't know what your world ranking is,
but it's a testimony to your skill level.

941
00:44:36,907 --> 00:44:37,775
So, I left.

942
00:44:38,876 --> 00:44:40,010
And I deal with it now.

943
00:44:40,744 --> 00:44:42,946
-I'm a homophobe.
-[audience laughs]

944
00:44:43,013 --> 00:44:46,950
My friends are like, "No, just 'cause you
wouldn't fuck a ladyboy hooker in Thailand

945
00:44:47,017 --> 00:44:48,719
that does not make you homophobic."

946
00:44:48,786 --> 00:44:51,155
But I disagree, you guys.
I think it does.

947
00:44:51,221 --> 00:44:53,090
[audience laughs]

948
00:44:53,157 --> 00:44:56,226
Like, you guys, Austin, Texas,
you're not homophobic, right?

949
00:44:56,293 --> 00:44:58,796
Austin, Texas.
The rest of Texas I'm sure is.

950
00:44:58,862 --> 00:45:00,097
[audience laughs]

951
00:45:00,164 --> 00:45:02,699
Probably most of you aren't homophobic.
You aren't.

952
00:45:02,766 --> 00:45:04,334
You're not. Would you fuck a ladyboy?

953
00:45:05,869 --> 00:45:06,737
No? It's okay.

954
00:45:06,804 --> 00:45:08,705
-[man] I got a girl.
-You've got a girl. Fine.

955
00:45:08,772 --> 00:45:11,008
But let's say she died
in a horrible car accident.

956
00:45:11,775 --> 00:45:15,479
And you wanted to console yourself
in the arms of a beautiful ladyboy woman.

957
00:45:15,746 --> 00:45:17,381
[audience laughing]

958
00:45:17,448 --> 00:45:20,150
I think that's probably
everybody's answer. Probably.

959
00:45:20,217 --> 00:45:22,319
Like, not fuck a ladyboy,
also not homophobic.

960
00:45:23,787 --> 00:45:25,823
But let me ask you all a question.

961
00:45:26,757 --> 00:45:29,093
And actually,
I'll just ask you three in particular.

962
00:45:29,726 --> 00:45:31,929
This is a question for every guy in here

963
00:45:32,729 --> 00:45:35,766
to think about.
Would you rather fuck a ladyboy

964
00:45:36,433 --> 00:45:37,301
or...

965
00:45:37,935 --> 00:45:38,936
a sheep?

966
00:45:39,436 --> 00:45:41,004
[audience laughs]

967
00:45:41,872 --> 00:45:43,173
You're thinking about it!

968
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:45,175
[audience laughing]

969
00:45:45,242 --> 00:45:46,376
It's human!

970
00:45:47,344 --> 00:45:48,912
The answer is human!

971
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:52,950
You would fuck our species
over any other species!

972
00:45:54,351 --> 00:45:57,888
Homophobe, homophobe,
homophobe, homophobe!

973
00:46:00,824 --> 00:46:03,794
I know. It got me, too. That's the only
reason I know it's a hard question.

974
00:46:04,962 --> 00:46:07,831
Somebody asked me. I was like,
"What's the sheep doing? Just walking by?

975
00:46:07,898 --> 00:46:10,534
Is it, like, looking at me all weird?

976
00:46:10,801 --> 00:46:13,036
It's not a talking sheep, right,
doesn't know my friends?"

977
00:46:14,004 --> 00:46:15,906
-Homophobe!
-[audience laughing]

978
00:46:15,973 --> 00:46:17,374
Thank you very much, everybody.

979
00:46:17,441 --> 00:46:19,409
[audience applauding and cheering]

980
00:46:20,911 --> 00:46:22,312
You guys have been tremendous.

981
00:46:24,081 --> 00:46:25,883
What a fucking pleasure to play here.

982
00:46:28,152 --> 00:46:30,387
Have a good night, everybody.
Thank you very much.
