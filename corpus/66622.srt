1
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,309
In the late 20th century,

2
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:28,710
hostile forces inside
the United States grow strong.

3
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,918
The city of Los Angeles
is ravaged by crime and immorality.

4
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,594
To protect and defend its citizens,

5
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:39,070
the United States
Police Force is formed.

6
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:42,311
A presidential candidate
predicts a millennium earthquake

7
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,755
will destroy LA
in divine retribution.

8
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,751
Like the mighty fist of God,

9
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:49,638
Armageddon will descend upon
the city of Los Angeles -

10
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:53,474
the city of sin,
the city of Gomorrah and Sodom -

11
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,516
and waters will arise

12
00:02:55,600 --> 00:03:00,230
and separate this sinful,
sinful city from our country.

13
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:04,438
An earthquake measuring 9.6
on the Richter scale

14
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:10,868
hits at 12:59pm,
August 23 in the year 2000.

15
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:51,272
After the devastation,
the Constitution is amended,

16
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:55,478
and the newly-elected president
accepts a lifetime term of office.

17
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:58,757
The country's capital is
relocated from Washington, DC,

18
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:02,196
to the President's home town
of Lynchburg, Virginia.

19
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:06,432
Los Angeles island is declared
no longer part of the United States,

20
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:09,159
and becomes the deportation point

21
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:13,870
for all people found unfit to live
in a new, moral America.

22
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:16,633
The United States Police Force,
like an army,

23
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,711
is encamped along the shoreline,

24
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,030
making any escape from LA impossible.

25
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:25,398
From the south-east of Orange
country to the north-west of Malibu,

26
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:28,677
the Great Wall excludes LA
from the mainland.

27
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:33,276
The President's first act as
commander in chief is Directive 17-

28
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,158
Once an American loses
his or her citizenship,

29
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:40,995
they are deported to this island of
the damned and may never come back.

30
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,073
Attention. We are on tactical alert.

31
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:59,116
Remain at battle stations.

32
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:01,760
I repeat, remain at battle stations.

33
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:40,629
This is the Police Channel,
and this is Prime News.

34
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:43,871
In a late-breaking story,
the Force has announced

35
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:47,316
the arrival of the most
notorious outlaw in US history

36
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:52,155
at Firebase Seven, the deportation
centre for Los Angeles island.

37
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,276
Now this on-the-scene report.

38
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:57,511
War hero. Criminal.
The Force's most wanted man.

39
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,511
Convicted of 27 moral crimes.

40
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:03,673
Arrested two weeks ago on a charge
of gunfighting for profit

41
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:06,354
in New Vegas, Thailand,
US territory.

42
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:10,115
It's been 16 years since
his famous rescue in New York,

43
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:13,192
and the reports
of Plissken sightings...

44
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,759
Commander?

45
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:17,798
I'm still getting a trace
from the rescue team, sir.

46
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:21,156
- Stationary signal?
- Has not moved from this location.

47
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:25,431
That means he's hiding,
captured, or dead.

48
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,556
So we go with Plissken?

49
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:29,596
He's all we've got.

50
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,310
Hello, Plissken.

51
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,356
Welcome to LA.

52
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,956
Come on. Move it.

53
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:14,273
- That's Snake Plissken?
- What did you expect?

54
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:18,114
He just looks so retro.
Kind of 20th century.

55
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:20,953
Good old days. Let's get going.

56
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:28,472
You are now entering
the deportation centre.

57
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:32,553
You have been found guilty
of moral crimes against the USA

58
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:36,553
and sentenced to permanent expulsion
beyond its borders.

59
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:41,316
Failure to follow instructions
will be met with use of force.

60
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:43,118
Look at 'em, Plissken.

61
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:46,317
Prostitutes, atheists, runaways...

62
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:49,153
We're throwing out the trash.

63
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:53,799
"SD Bob Plissken,
Special Forces." Two Purple Hearts?

64
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:57,031
Youngest man ever decorated
by the President.

65
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,315
Rescued a different president in '97.

66
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:01,436
So, what happened to you, war hero?

67
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:04,512
You were the best.
Now you're just like them.

68
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:09,151
You had it all and you turned away
from your country. Why?

69
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:11,435
The whole nation's watching.

70
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:16,116
Every good and decent person
who works hard and follows the rules.

71
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:19,158
Be my guest.
What do you have to say, Plissken?

72
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:22,635
Call me Snake.

73
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:29,278
You are now entering
the processing area.

74
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:32,591
The next scheduled departure
to LA is in one hour.

75
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:47,798
You now have the option
to repent of your sins

76
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:51,236
and be electrocuted
on the premises.

77
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:53,356
If you elect this option,

78
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:57,399
notify the cleric sergeant
in your processing area.

79
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:46,636
How's it going, hotshot?

80
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:51,676
You know, I got to admit.

81
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:54,354
I thought we had you in Cleveland.

82
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:59,109
- How'd you do it?
- Get to the deal.

83
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:02,078
- What?
- You need me for something. What?

84
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,116
Show him.

85
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:24,836
At 1030 hours, Wednesday,
a group of government officials

86
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:27,798
began a tour
of the Benford Space Defence lab.

87
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:30,758
The President's daughter,
Utopia, was among them.

88
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:34,389
During the tour, she came into
possession of a top-secret prototype.

89
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:37,597
Then she boarded
Air Force Three for Lynchburg.

90
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,636
To the American people -

91
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:44,316
now is the time to rise up and demand
the surrender of the President

92
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:48,837
and his corrupt theocracy
of lies and terror!

93
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:52,469
At 1140 hours,
she hijacked Air Force Three.

94
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,996
We scanned this onto the VR.

95
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:59,473
Check it out.

96
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:03,678
Today is day one
of a brand-new world.

97
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:06,433
The days of empire are finished.

98
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:09,637
To the President, my father...

99
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:11,631
You know what's in here,

100
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:14,029
and unless you open your borders,

101
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:18,511
allow all the wrongfully accused
to return to their country,

102
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:22,832
I will use this on you
and on the United States.

103
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:35,757
Her emergency escape pod
landed somewhere in LA.

104
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:39,913
Her ELT signal ceased immediately.
After that, silence.

105
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,389
We sent a five-man rescue team.

106
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:45,950
Within hours of landing
all but one was killed.

107
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:47,598
Hell of a team.

108
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:50,797
Skip the commentary, Plissken.

109
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,711
Call me Snake.

110
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,711
Get on with it.

111
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,836
After her sister committed suicide,

112
00:11:56,920 --> 00:12:00,310
Utopia began to withdraw
into her virtual reality simulator.

113
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:04,518
She'd punch up her own world
and stay in it for days.

114
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,352
Somebody else was in there.

115
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:10,194
Utopia made tapes of her VR
experiences and tried to erase them,

116
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:12,316
but she missed one image.

117
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:16,393
We found this fragment
on the end of her last tape.

118
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:21,952
Cuervo Jones. Peruvian terrorist.
Shining Path member.

119
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:23,996
Runs the Mescalito Justice,

120
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:26,275
biggest, baddest gang in LA.

121
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:30,956
Somehow, Cuervo Jones managed
to tap into the VR master data bank.

122
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:33,952
Utopia was looking
for something to believe in,

123
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:37,271
so he used her
to steal the black box.

124
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:40,238
Sad story. You got a smoke?

125
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,231
This is serious, Plissken.

126
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,993
The black box is a matter
of national security.

127
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:48,789
Looks like it belongs
to Utopia's lover-boy now.

128
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:51,440
Yeah. We want it back.

129
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:53,476
I'll bet.

130
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,198
What's it do?

131
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:59,750
Top secret. Only on a need-to-know.

132
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:02,149
Evidently, I don't need to know,

133
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,356
so fuck you, I'm going to Hollywood.

134
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:08,592
If you go into LA,
bring back the black box,

135
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:13,629
and you will receive a pardon for
every immoral act you have committed.

136
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:15,631
Sounds familiar.

137
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:17,870
An immediate answer.

138
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:20,874
Yes or no?

139
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:25,072
Who are you?

140
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:27,720
I'm your president.

141
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:30,360
I understand you got
some domestic problems.

142
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:34,115
Put that black box in my hand,
and you're a free man.

143
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:41,118
I can see you're real concerned
about your daughter.

144
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:43,395
Utopia is lost to me.
My daughter is gone.

145
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:48,272
- Last chance, hotshot.
- For what?

146
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:49,793
Freedom, sir.

147
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:53,555
In America?
That died a long time ago.

148
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:55,596
I've heard enough of this.

149
00:13:55,680 --> 00:14:01,437
Explain to this foot soldier why he's
going to do what we tell him to do.

150
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:04,029
What's he talking about?

151
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:06,315
The Plutoxin Seven virus.

152
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:10,791
Genetically engineered.
100% pure death.

153
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:13,155
Complete nervous system shut-down.

154
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:18,109
You crash. You bleed out like
a stuck pig. It's not a pretty sight.

155
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,757
I see.

156
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:25,958
You figure I'll do whatever you
want, just like New York, huh?

157
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:28,600
- You got it... Snake.
- One question.

158
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:31,717
Which one of you assholes gets to die
trying to stick me?

159
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:35,236
You don't understand.
It's already in you.

160
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:41,676
Catches on quick, doesn't he?

161
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:48,636
Your countdown clock
is now activated.

162
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:51,678
Designer viruses, Plissken.
Wave of the future.

163
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:54,399
You've got less than ten hours
to live.

164
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:59,076
It's already moving through your
bloodstream. Go on-touch that pad.

165
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,910
Of course, there is an antidote,

166
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,549
and it neutralises the virus
immediately upon injection.

167
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:13,030
Which I will personally authorise
once your mission is completed.

168
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:20,474
The man is too dumb to survive LA.

169
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,955
We're holograms, Plissken.

170
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:27,909
Give us a little credit.
We're not that stupid.

171
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:35,515
Get this crap out of me.

172
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:38,155
I guess we've got a deal.

173
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:47,318
Nice to be working with you, hotshot.

174
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:52,309
You'd better hope
I don't make it back.

175
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:54,231
All of you.

176
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:58,394
Core burner, magnesium ammo,

177
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,789
500 extra rounds.

178
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:06,000
Oral projectile. Mouth dart, filled
with urolyde. It will stun the enemy.

179
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:09,629
Every member of the rescue team
had a tracking chip in his arm.

180
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:14,635
One might still be alive. Use the
tracer in your watch to locate him.

181
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:19,271
This holographic camera will project
your image up to a half-mile away.

182
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,316
100% audio capability.

183
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:24,073
It's a prototype.
Confuse and deceive the enemy.

184
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:28,676
Its mini-nuke battery is good for
eight minutes, but only works once.

185
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:30,955
Save it for when it counts.

186
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:37,555
Plain old-fashioned matches.
Never know when you might need them.

187
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,797
Where are my guns?

188
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:44,269
I thought you might want those.

189
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:54,274
Stealth clothing. Fire retardant,
nullifies heat detection.

190
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:56,112
Put them on.

191
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:02,956
I'll take the coat.

192
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,352
You'll take 'em all.

193
00:17:56,920 --> 00:18:02,074
All right. LA's being primed as a
beachhead for an invasion of the US.

194
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:05,277
War is being declared,
Plissken, or didn't you know?

195
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:08,113
Oh, I forgot. You don't give a shit.

196
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:11,351
Cuervo Jones runs Shining Path.
They want North America.

197
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:14,079
The revenge
of preindustrial societies.

198
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,594
Shining Path has united
Third World countries.

199
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:19,240
The Cubans and Brazilians
will invade Miami.

200
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:23,472
The Colombians are at the border,
we've got a full-scale attack.

201
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:26,393
- High stakes.
- How am I going in?

202
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:30,553
Under the San Fernando Sea. Shark
Three submarine, one-man submersible.

203
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:34,189
Just like the turbine model,
only this one's nuclear-powered.

204
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:37,431
It's very simple.
Throttle up, throttle back.

205
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,636
Put ashore at the Cuegan Pass.

206
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:42,598
Go through the mountains
toward the Hollywood Bowl.

207
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:45,148
Locate the survivor
of the rescue team.

208
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:47,356
He's your only source of information.

209
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:49,908
- Do I bring him back?
- Negative.

210
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,833
- Figures.
- He's probably already dead.

211
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:55,912
Once you go inside,
you're on your own.

212
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,912
Get the black box
back to the submarine.

213
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,673
It's your only way out.
Plissken!

214
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,994
You know what to do with the girl.

215
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:09,312
We don't need to waste any more time
and money on bullshit trials.

216
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,674
Kill her.

217
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:13,115
Is that order from the President?

218
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:16,351
Absolutely. Let's just say
it's best for the country.

219
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:19,716
By the way,
who gives me the antidote?

220
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:22,712
- A medical team.
- Neither of you?

221
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,153
- No.
- Good.

222
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:31,791
Thought you'd try that, hotshot.
The first clip is loaded with blanks.

223
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,632
Bye bye, Snake. Good luck.

224
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:40,191
Nice and easy now.

225
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:59,311
- Com check.
- Yeah. I'm here.

226
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,958
Stand by for launch.

227
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:03,793
Eight hours, eight minutes,
26 seconds

228
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:05,836
to neurosystem shut-down.

229
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:09,871
Ignitor.

230
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:15,115
Fuel rod injection.

231
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,072
She's in the green.

232
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:23,470
- Lock fuel rods.
- Locked.

233
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:25,676
Nuclear turbine to 75% power.

234
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:33,633
75% power.

235
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:35,836
Hands on switches and counting.

236
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:36,875
Five...

237
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,791
four... three...

238
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,757
two... one.

239
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:42,558
Launch.

240
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:17,830
Watch your speed.
There's lots of obstructions.

241
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:28,748
His reactor's starting to overheat.

242
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:31,673
Slow down, you're overloading
the power plant!

243
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,955
You slow down, dickhead.
I'm dying.

244
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:35,996
Plissken!

245
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:39,037
Power plant overload.

246
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:45,519
Guidance systems malfunction.

247
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,955
You no longer have
control stick function.

248
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,359
Obstruction ahead.

249
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:10,156
Plissken.

250
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:13,714
Yeah. I'm here. Cuegan Pass.

251
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:17,509
'What happened to the submarine?
It disappeared off our screens.

252
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:19,477
Plissken!

253
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:22,876
I gotta go.

254
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:30,590
Too bad about your boat, man,

255
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:34,355
but we'd appreciate it
if you'd stay off our beach.

256
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:36,396
Just passing through.

257
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:40,554
You look kind of familiar.

258
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:46,555
- What do you want?
- Nothin'.

259
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:49,950
- I just recognised you, that's all.
- That's all?

260
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:53,032
Come on, man.
I'm not looking for trouble.

261
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:01,954
I used to see you a lot
when I surfed, on the Police Channel.

262
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:05,112
You're pretty far out, Snake.
I mean, cool.

263
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:09,432
But I kind of thought
you'd be... taller.

264
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:11,590
Which way to the Hollywood Bowl?

265
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:13,591
Down that way.

266
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:19,355
It's just an aftershock.
We get them all the time.

267
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:22,591
Thanks for not killing me, man.
I owe you one.

268
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:24,636
Acid rain.

269
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:28,750
Hey, Snake,
what are you doing here anyway?

270
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:33,910
I heard they busted you
pretty good in Cleveland.

271
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:58,559
Location of rescue team member -

272
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,870
50 yards from your present position.

273
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:18,389
Location of rescue team member -
40 yards from your present position.

274
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:33,597
Rescue team member is located
10 feet from your present position.

275
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:42,750
100 bucks says you can't
put three blades into him.

276
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:44,796
Want a throw?

277
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:48,315
Hey, one-eye, I'm talking to you.

278
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,960
Where can I find Cuervo Jones?

279
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:54,396
What do I look like,
a fucking tour guide?

280
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:06,470
- It's wintertime, baby.
- I'm looking for Cuervo Jones.

281
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:08,710
Why? Hershe's looking for Cuervo too.

282
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:13,590
- Where is he?
- He's on Sunset. He's gonna come by.

283
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:15,113
Sunset.

284
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:19,159
Boulevard. Ooh-hoo,
you really are new, aren't you?

285
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:21,834
Come on, baby. I'll show you.

286
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:30,954
Keep going down that way, honey.
You can't miss it.

287
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:37,316
Hey, one-eye!

288
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:41,908
Look in my face
when I talk to you, shit-heel.

289
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:45,635
Whoa!

290
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:55,273
Neurosystem shut-down-seven hours.

291
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:58,713
Plissken.

292
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:02,673
Yeah?

293
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:05,189
Did you find the team member?

294
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:08,113
Yeah, they're using him
for target practice.

295
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:09,428
What will you do?

296
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:12,910
Amigos, no matter
where you come from,

297
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:17,516
or what colour you are, we're
all the Russia of the oppressed!

298
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:20,194
- Watch the parade.
- What?

299
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:23,590
We've got the north by the balls.

300
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:26,399
Come on! Right? Right?

301
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:29,631
Meet me at the Happy Kingdom.

302
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:31,676
Let's party tonight,

303
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:36,709
because tomorrow we're going to
start our way back to glory!

304
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:04,393
Yeah! We got our freedom!
We got a future!

305
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:50,476
That looks like Snake Plissken.

306
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:51,709
Who?

307
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:55,793
Used to be a gunfighter. Faded
out from the scene a few years ago.

308
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:00,350
I hear he slowed down some.

309
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:13,396
Doesn't look that slow, Cuervo.

310
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:15,789
Watch it! Watch it!

311
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:41,354
No!

312
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:44,432
Nobody rolls into town
and disrespects me.

313
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:47,273
Not Snake Plissken, not nobody.
Bolas!

314
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:08,436
Take him out!

315
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:27,799
I'm gonna give
you assholes a chance.

316
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:32,668
What do you say
we play a little...

317
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:34,591
Bangkok rules?

318
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:08,112
Nobody draws
until this hits the ground.

319
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:12,518
You ready?

320
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:26,832
Draw.

321
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:47,318
Hey, he left his coat here, man.

322
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:58,714
Malloy.

323
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:03,194
Plissken.
Have you got the black box?

324
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:05,874
Negative. And I've lost
the core burner and holocam.

325
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:09,236
I don't need to know your problems,
I just want my black box.

326
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:13,074
You've got seven and a half hours.
Do you read me?

327
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:18,398
Listen, Malloy. This guy's got more
heat around him than the President.

328
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:21,677
I'll get your box,
but I need time, understand?

329
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:25,799
Listen, Plissken, that headache that
just kicked in will only get worse.

330
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:28,792
You're starting to feel
the effects of the virus.

331
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:30,836
Soon you'll have a fever.

332
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:34,879
Now, you bear that in mind.
Just push on through, soldier.

333
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:14,509
Oh, don't shoot. Don't shoot.

334
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:16,431
I thought it was you.

335
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:18,829
Yeah, I recognised you right away.

336
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:21,275
I've been hangin' round here
for years,

337
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:23,920
but I never thought I'd see
Snake Plissken.

338
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,594
It's a real pleasure to meet you.

339
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:28,830
I'm Map To The Stars Eddie.

340
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:32,395
Where's Cuervo Jones' place?

341
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:35,074
He's the man with
the President's daughter.

342
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:39,756
He's setting up something big, but I
got a feeling you know that, right?

343
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:42,193
Location.

344
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:43,429
That way.

345
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:48,554
If you're going through Beverly
Hills, you're gonna need a map.

346
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:51,635
It's pre-recorded.
I narrated it myself.

347
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:56,198
Welcome to your own map to the stars.

348
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:57,759
That's me.

349
00:35:57,840 --> 00:36:00,991
The big one wiped out the
entertainment industry in LA,

350
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:03,913
but the glamour of Hollywood
is still alive,

351
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,275
so come and see where the stars...

352
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:09,193
Hey, Snake, you'll need this.
I'm telling you.

353
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:13,193
I'll give you a deal. 50,000 bucks.
That's a real bargain!

354
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:15,999
...Map To The Stars Eddie,
and here we go.

355
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:17,354
Sucker.

356
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:50,316
Stay down, man, or they'll see you.

357
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:53,995
It's only their second shift.
Don't make one move.

358
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:59,192
If you want to make noise,
go and find another bush.

359
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:01,748
You're the one making all the noise.

360
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:17,273
Ah, shit!

361
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:27,273
Plissken's tracer just went down.

362
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:28,509
Terminated?

363
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:31,512
Yes. We can't locate him -
he's wearing stealth.

364
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:34,239
- Now what?
- We sit tight and wait.

365
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:37,073
Wait? For how long?
He's probably dead.

366
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:38,957
Wait, Mr President. Be patient.

367
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:10,551
I told you to stay down.
Look what you've done.

368
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:12,596
I can't believe this.

369
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:15,556
Are you Snake Plissken?

370
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:20,638
You look like him... in a way.

371
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:26,113
By the way, genius,
we're both dead meat.

372
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:35,637
What are they?

373
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:38,280
Surgical failures.

374
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:40,157
They live here.

375
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:43,516
Too many implants and face-lifts
over the years.

376
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:45,556
Their muscles turn to Jell-O.

377
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:48,871
They only survive
by having fresh body parts

378
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:52,032
transplanted over and over again.

379
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:57,599
Oh, my God.

380
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:59,636
Who's that?

381
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:04,757
The surgeon general of Beverly Hills.

382
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:08,036
These are no good.

383
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:12,355
You couldn't give them away.

384
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:13,953
And this...

385
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:19,193
I can do nothing with this one.
Wheel it away.

386
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:22,994
I can't work with garbage like this.

387
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:27,796
Now, these two...

388
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:32,436
They look very good.

389
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:39,196
My God, they're real.

390
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,956
What a beautiful blue eye.

391
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:59,190
Shame he only has one.

392
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:01,555
Nurse!

393
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:03,153
Still...

394
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:07,076
One eye's better than none.

395
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:20,757
Anybody moves, I'll blow
his brains out and then yours.

396
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:25,356
You... get my guns.

397
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:27,510
Now.

398
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:35,149
Back off.

399
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:37,310
Now, everybody relax,
and he won't die.

400
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:39,868
Hey. Hey, man, help me.

401
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:44,078
You'll never find your way
out of here without me.

402
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:45,559
Really.

403
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:47,551
Cut her down.

404
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:01,838
Down there.

405
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:07,032
Quickly.

406
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:12,076
Get in.

407
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:35,836
I think we lost them.

408
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:39,151
I think we're lost.

409
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:41,356
This way.

410
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:46,713
I used to run guns
with the Black Jihad last year.

411
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:49,997
We drove golf carts
up and down these tunnels.

412
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:53,231
I know them
like the back of my hand.

413
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:57,716
You are Snake Plissken, aren't you?

414
00:41:57,800 --> 00:41:59,631
I used to be.

415
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:01,676
I thought you'd be taller.

416
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:05,872
- What are you doing in LA?
- Dying.

417
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:09,714
Ooh. But first
you got to find something?

418
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:12,678
President's daughter.
She's with Cuervo Jones.

419
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:15,433
You want to go to Cuervo's place?

420
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:18,398
- I've been there once.
- Show me.

421
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:20,436
All right.

422
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:23,156
I always heard about you,

423
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:25,993
like they couldn't catch you
no matter what you did.

424
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:27,991
Very cool, Snake.

425
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:30,833
Sooner or later, they get everybody.

426
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:32,672
Up.

427
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:52,430
Cuervo Jones' place is down that way.

428
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:57,150
Get off at the Vermont exit.
Go south. You can't miss it.

429
00:42:57,240 --> 00:43:00,277
Be careful, though.
This is Korean Dragon territory.

430
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:03,318
It's very dangerous around here.

431
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:05,118
Bye.

432
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:08,916
Snake?

433
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:12,910
When you find
the President's daughter,

434
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,434
are you going to take her back?

435
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:17,476
No.

436
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:20,472
- You're staying in LA?
- Not if I can help it.

437
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:25,792
Sun is coming up in a few hours.

438
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:27,916
UV's gonna be bad today.

439
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:32,198
I know a place where
we could crash...

440
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:34,236
if you want.

441
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:38,359
My boyfriend and I
broke up tonight, so...

442
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:41,000
I'd love to take care of you...

443
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:45,509
and make you feel good.

444
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:48,955
I'll read your future.

445
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:53,075
The future is right now.

446
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:21,714
...and condemn the innocent blood.

447
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:27,238
Dear God, we call on you to be
our defence and our refuge.

448
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:29,709
We give thanks for being alive,

449
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:32,268
and pray that in your mercy...

450
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:36,752
Snake, it's me - Taslima.

451
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:41,956
I'm coming with you
to Cuervo's place. Yeah?

452
00:44:44,120 --> 00:44:45,872
They're new.

453
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:48,030
They don't belong to any gang.

454
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:50,076
They're just scared, that's all.

455
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:53,038
That's how I was
when they first deported me.

456
00:44:53,120 --> 00:44:56,669
- Why are you here?
- I was a Muslim in South Dakota.

457
00:44:56,760 --> 00:44:58,796
Suddenly they made it a crime.

458
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:02,077
I mean, why stay?
You can go south - Mexico.

459
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:07,188
LA's still the place. What's happened
on the other side of the world...

460
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:09,236
That's the prison.

461
00:45:09,320 --> 00:45:12,676
This is the only
free zone left... anywhere.

462
00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:17,551
Dark paradise.

463
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:19,915
At least we get something.

464
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:26,160
A girl can still wear a fur coat
if she wants to, for example.

465
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:29,198
No, no, once you
figure out this place,

466
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:31,953
it's really not so bad.

467
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:34,956
Get down!

468
00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:52,554
Where's it coming from?

469
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:55,438
The car in the street below!

470
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,560
Hop in, Snake. Come on.

471
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:42,629
Nobody ever gets out
of Beverly Hills alive.

472
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:47,430
- That's why you let me go there.
- You need one of my maps.

473
00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:52,552
Listen to me, Snake.
I got connections here.

474
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:55,871
You can't just walk around
without knowing the ropes.

475
00:46:55,960 --> 00:46:58,076
Take the wrong street, you're dead.

476
00:46:58,160 --> 00:46:59,832
Stop the car.

477
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:02,480
All right, anything you say.

478
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:05,836
Although I was going to take you
to Cuervo Jones' place.

479
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:09,276
- Where is it?
- Right over there.

480
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:21,192
It's pretty neat, huh?
It's Cuervo's car. He lets me use it.

481
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:24,795
Don't worry, you've just
been shot with a fun gun.

482
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:26,677
Feel it? You feel it?

483
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:29,593
It's pure mesh, man.
100-proof artery choker.

484
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:34,276
When the hit pulls you an inch
from death, that is living.

485
00:47:34,360 --> 00:47:38,035
I'm actually Cuervo's agent,
I'd love to represent you too.

486
00:47:38,120 --> 00:47:41,192
We could make a bundle.
Help your career.

487
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:44,670
Last couple of years,
it's like you've disappeared...

488
00:47:46,520 --> 00:47:49,432
I know what the cops sent him to do.

489
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:53,798
Plissken was the second rescue team,
looking for the box and the girl.

490
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:59,238
All I'm asking for is a finder's fee.
Maybe Wisconsin. I don't know.

491
00:47:59,320 --> 00:48:02,278
- We're almost set up, Cuervo.
- Good.

492
00:48:04,360 --> 00:48:09,718
I originally heard about this
when I was working for NASA.

493
00:48:09,800 --> 00:48:14,794
Common, ordinary remote-control unit.
Yeah? Everyone's got one, right?

494
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:17,440
Here's the kicker.

495
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:21,991
This instruction disk hooks you
into the Sword of Damocles,

496
00:48:22,080 --> 00:48:24,150
the ultimate defensive weapon system.

497
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:29,352
You see that?

498
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:32,000
A ring of satellites
encircling the earth.

499
00:48:32,080 --> 00:48:36,232
Attached to each satellite
is a mega neutron bomb.

500
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:38,709
When detonated, each satellite

501
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:41,439
unleashes an intense
electromagnetic pulse,

502
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:43,829
but EMP doesn't harm a living thing.

503
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:48,914
But it does shut down every known
power source, all electrical devices,

504
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,275
cars, aeroplanes, toasters,

505
00:48:51,360 --> 00:48:53,828
computers, everything...
even batteries.

506
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:59,233
But this... makes this
an aiming device

507
00:48:59,320 --> 00:49:03,029
that gives the user
incredible accuracy.

508
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:06,749
You can pinpoint precisely
what you want to shut down.

509
00:49:06,840 --> 00:49:11,038
A taxi cab in Buenos Aires,
the entire country of Spain. Amazing.

510
00:49:11,120 --> 00:49:13,998
You could shut down the whole planet,

511
00:49:14,080 --> 00:49:16,640
send it right back to the Dark Ages.

512
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:19,591
- He's dead.
- I agree.

513
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:23,434
Plissken's been dead before,
but he never stays down.

514
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:25,476
The mission's scrubbed, Commander.

515
00:49:25,560 --> 00:49:28,711
I shouldn't have let you
talk me out of that air strike.

516
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:33,669
Well, it's on now, effective
immediately. Full-scale.

517
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:36,558
Target Los Angeles.
Flatten it. Burn it.

518
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:37,709
No!

519
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:42,837
What did you say?

520
00:49:42,920 --> 00:49:46,435
Cuervo Jones is holding
all the cards now, sir.

521
00:49:46,520 --> 00:49:49,751
He sees our aircraft,
he pushes that button... kaboom!

522
00:49:49,840 --> 00:49:53,150
There goes our aircraft
AND the United States.

523
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:58,756
We don't even know if he knows
how to work the goddam thing.

524
00:49:58,840 --> 00:50:01,638
Snake Plissken, American outlaw.

525
00:50:01,720 --> 00:50:03,472
You'll like this.

526
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:08,998
Remember, Cuevo, you've got to punch
in the world code first - 666.

527
00:50:09,080 --> 00:50:11,913
That brings all
the satellites on line.

528
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,560
Eh, pendejo, you think I'm stupid?

529
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:17,074
No. No. No. I'm sorry, Cuervo.

530
00:50:17,160 --> 00:50:18,878
Bring them in.

531
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:24,436
OK, OK, go on.

532
00:50:26,600 --> 00:50:30,752
'Hello, North America.
Buenas noches, Sud America.

533
00:50:30,840 --> 00:50:35,197
Yes, I am Cuervo Jones...

534
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:36,998
Wait a minute.

535
00:50:37,080 --> 00:50:38,559
That's Plissken.

536
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:42,349
This is LA, people without
hope or a country.

537
00:50:42,440 --> 00:50:44,112
I knew it. He's alive.

538
00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:47,670
You know what they want-liberation.

539
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:50,069
Now it's their turn.

540
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:52,958
I am taking over with this.

541
00:50:54,920 --> 00:50:58,196
I told you not to try
to get this back, didn't I?

542
00:50:58,280 --> 00:51:01,511
But you disobeyed me. Well...

543
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:04,790
He's entering the target code.

544
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:07,678
Bend over, Mr President.

545
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:09,910
Time for a spanking.

546
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:13,470
He's targeting Lynchburg.
That'll shut down the capital.

547
00:51:13,560 --> 00:51:15,391
Get me the White House.

548
00:51:15,480 --> 00:51:19,792
- This broadcast is live...
- Get me my wife, please.

549
00:51:19,880 --> 00:51:23,236
- Are you watching TV?
- Yes, I'm watching it.

550
00:51:23,320 --> 00:51:24,833
Yes, I know.

551
00:51:24,920 --> 00:51:26,353
Curfew.

552
00:51:26,440 --> 00:51:29,398
Hello? Hello?

553
00:51:29,480 --> 00:51:31,550
Hey, Presidente,

554
00:51:31,640 --> 00:51:33,631
silence is golden, no?

555
00:51:33,720 --> 00:51:37,679
Don't tell me you didn't
enjoy this just a little bit.

556
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:40,911
I mean, if your wife's
anything like your daughter,

557
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:44,197
she's sweet,
but you just can't shut her up.

558
00:51:44,280 --> 00:51:46,350
Knock it off, Cuervo.

559
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:48,590
All right, now this is set.

560
00:51:48,680 --> 00:51:52,440
We shut down
the entire United States.

561
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:56,752
I want a police chopper to come
and get me at the Happy Kingdom,

562
00:51:56,840 --> 00:51:58,796
no later than 5am.

563
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:03,317
Once I'm airborne,
you'll get your orders.

564
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:08,474
Remember, don't piss me off,
or I'll... pull the plug.

565
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:12,192
I'm at the mercy of this madman.

566
00:52:12,280 --> 00:52:14,430
Don't count Plissken out, sir.

567
00:52:14,520 --> 00:52:16,954
He's tanked. He's a POW.

568
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:18,189
But he's still alive.

569
00:53:34,360 --> 00:53:39,434
Six, five, four, three, two, one!

570
00:53:43,480 --> 00:53:45,596
Shot clock!

571
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:06,711
Get him. Get him up.

572
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:16,231
But this is insane.

573
00:54:16,320 --> 00:54:19,198
It is. That's the point.

574
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:41,030
All right, all right.

575
00:54:49,640 --> 00:54:52,791
I promised you tonight
was going to be special.

576
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:58,637
I also promised one last spectacle
of death in this historic arena.

577
00:54:58,720 --> 00:55:01,314
Now you will see that death.

578
00:55:01,400 --> 00:55:03,675
I give you...

579
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:09,437
the death of Snake Plissken!

580
00:55:25,120 --> 00:55:27,588
Some people think
you're already dead, Snake.

581
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:29,875
Some say you never will be.

582
00:55:29,960 --> 00:55:32,394
You may have survived Cleveland,

583
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:35,597
you may have
escaped from New York,

584
00:55:35,680 --> 00:55:37,750
but this is LA, vato.

585
00:55:37,840 --> 00:55:43,710
And you're about to find out that
this fucking city can kill anybody!

586
00:55:43,800 --> 00:55:45,950
LA! LA!

587
00:56:01,240 --> 00:56:03,754
Game time!

588
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:10,552
Basketball.

589
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:13,996
Two hoops. Full court.
10-second shot clock.

590
00:56:14,080 --> 00:56:15,798
Miss a shot-get shot.

591
00:56:15,880 --> 00:56:18,952
Buzzer goes off
before you shoot-get shot.

592
00:56:19,040 --> 00:56:21,873
Two points for a basket.
No three-point bullshit.

593
00:56:21,960 --> 00:56:25,999
All you got to do is make
10 points. That's it.

594
00:56:29,040 --> 00:56:30,393
By the way,

595
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:34,393
nobody's ever walked
off that court alive.

596
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:36,152
Nobody.

597
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:43,479
All right!

598
00:56:59,680 --> 00:57:02,319
Six, five, four...

599
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:03,992
three, two,

600
00:57:04,080 --> 00:57:05,308
one!

601
00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:15,269
Five, four...

602
00:57:15,360 --> 00:57:17,920
three, two, one!

603
00:57:27,240 --> 00:57:29,800
- Nice shot.
- He's getting tired now.

604
00:57:29,880 --> 00:57:33,395
Four, three, two, one!

605
00:58:33,960 --> 00:58:35,757
This town loves a winner.

606
00:58:45,400 --> 00:58:47,356
He won, Cuervo.

607
00:58:51,080 --> 00:58:54,152
- You can't kill him.
- I have to.

608
00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:02,758
Get off!

609
00:59:09,280 --> 00:59:10,759
It's the big one!

610
00:59:22,280 --> 00:59:24,111
Find him!

611
00:59:24,200 --> 00:59:25,553
We're going to Anaheim.

612
00:59:25,640 --> 00:59:26,595
Come here.

613
00:59:28,440 --> 00:59:32,353
Cuervo. Cuervo, wait up.
Give me a minute!

614
00:59:32,440 --> 00:59:35,830
- Get lost, agent!
- We got a relationship here, man.

615
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:37,876
Let me make something clear.

616
00:59:37,960 --> 00:59:40,918
I'm getting irritated,
and that's not good.

617
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:45,232
Irritated with me? Cuervo, I'm
taking care of you, understand?

618
00:59:45,320 --> 00:59:48,517
- We can't find him, Cuervo.
- Keep looking!

619
00:59:56,800 --> 00:59:58,756
Get in the car.

620
01:00:01,640 --> 01:00:05,076
If I'm being too rough on you,
just let me know.

621
01:00:47,080 --> 01:00:50,516
Snake, don't shoot. It's me - Utopia.

622
01:00:50,600 --> 01:00:52,795
I'm alone.

623
01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:55,269
This whole place is a nightmare.

624
01:00:57,160 --> 01:00:59,116
Cuervo's a killer.

625
01:00:59,200 --> 01:01:01,191
He's worse than my father.

626
01:01:01,280 --> 01:01:04,590
I want to go back with you.

627
01:01:09,360 --> 01:01:11,316
Oh, my God.

628
01:01:11,400 --> 01:01:14,756
My father sent you
to kill me, didn't he?

629
01:01:19,680 --> 01:01:21,511
Shut up.

630
01:01:21,600 --> 01:01:23,431
Get out of here.

631
01:01:25,440 --> 01:01:26,873
Go.

632
01:01:26,960 --> 01:01:30,191
Wait. You can't
take that back, Snake.

633
01:01:30,280 --> 01:01:33,033
Oh, God.
You can't give that to him.

634
01:01:33,120 --> 01:01:36,635
He wants to control everything,
just like Cuervo.

635
01:01:36,720 --> 01:01:39,996
If I don't take it back, I'm dead.

636
01:01:44,960 --> 01:01:46,234
Another one?

637
01:02:00,320 --> 01:02:01,389
Run!

638
01:02:12,440 --> 01:02:13,998
It's over.

639
01:02:14,080 --> 01:02:17,038
Get me a damage report
as soon as possible.

640
01:02:17,120 --> 01:02:18,633
Yes, sir.

641
01:02:18,720 --> 01:02:20,950
Oh, thank God almighty.

642
01:02:21,040 --> 01:02:25,750
Maybe that's the answer
to all of our problems.

643
01:02:25,840 --> 01:02:29,594
Maybe... maybe they're all dead.

644
01:02:29,680 --> 01:02:31,477
Maybe.

645
01:02:33,520 --> 01:02:37,229
Oh, Cuervo, man!
We almost bought the farm.

646
01:02:37,320 --> 01:02:39,993
The whole place
just fell in right behind us.

647
01:02:41,200 --> 01:02:43,156
Where is Plissken?

648
01:02:43,240 --> 01:02:47,438
He's down there. He's dead.
He's history, and I did it.

649
01:02:47,520 --> 01:02:49,351
I killed him. I shot him.

650
01:02:49,440 --> 01:02:51,396
Right? Tell him.

651
01:02:54,680 --> 01:02:56,432
Give it to me.

652
01:02:56,520 --> 01:02:59,910
Oh, yeah. I brought it
back to you, Cuervo.

653
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:01,956
It's all there.

654
01:03:14,160 --> 01:03:17,357
Whoa, dude, is that you, Snake?

655
01:03:17,440 --> 01:03:19,476
Far out, man.

656
01:03:19,560 --> 01:03:22,313
Hey, did you find Cuervo, man?

657
01:03:22,400 --> 01:03:24,868
Hey, Cuervo, wait.
I've done it all, man.

658
01:03:24,960 --> 01:03:28,794
I killed Plissken.
I got your girl back for you...

659
01:03:28,880 --> 01:03:30,233
So where is he?

660
01:03:30,320 --> 01:03:32,470
I shot him.

661
01:03:32,560 --> 01:03:34,437
He went down, OK?

662
01:03:34,520 --> 01:03:37,671
His body's probably in
Wilshire Canyon somewhere.

663
01:03:37,760 --> 01:03:40,558
Good! So then you know where he is.

664
01:03:40,640 --> 01:03:42,596
Bring me his head.

665
01:03:47,320 --> 01:03:50,437
- Where's the Happy Kingdom?
- Anaheim. The invasion staging area.

666
01:03:50,520 --> 01:03:52,829
Everyone's gonna be there,
except me.

667
01:03:52,920 --> 01:03:57,232
I'm staying here, man,
I'm ready for the big wave.

668
01:03:57,320 --> 01:03:59,390
- Take me there.
- What?

669
01:03:59,480 --> 01:04:00,549
Take me there.

670
01:04:00,640 --> 01:04:03,279
You're not well, Snake.
You need help.

671
01:04:03,360 --> 01:04:05,271
Hold on.

672
01:04:05,360 --> 01:04:08,397
- Who shot you?
- It doesn't matter.

673
01:04:08,480 --> 01:04:09,913
Yeah, you're right.

674
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,195
Talk to Hershe.
She hates Cuervo.

675
01:04:12,280 --> 01:04:15,556
They used to be partners,
and they split up.

676
01:04:15,640 --> 01:04:18,154
- Who?
- Hershe.

677
01:04:18,240 --> 01:04:21,789
She lives in a big boat.
Hangs with Saigon Shadow.

678
01:04:21,880 --> 01:04:24,394
Man, they don't take shit
from nobody.

679
01:04:24,480 --> 01:04:26,869
What is that?

680
01:04:26,960 --> 01:04:29,110
Tsunami, Snake. Tsunami! Woo!

681
01:04:29,200 --> 01:04:32,351
Surf's up big-time now,
mister. Ha ha!

682
01:04:32,440 --> 01:04:37,150
Start feeling better quick, man,
cos you ain't got time to escape.

683
01:04:37,240 --> 01:04:40,755
This is going to be some ride, man,
some kind of bitchin' ride.

684
01:04:40,840 --> 01:04:42,876
Let's go. Come on.

685
01:04:42,960 --> 01:04:45,394
Bitchin', man.

686
01:04:47,200 --> 01:04:51,751
Let the front edge pick you up. Don't
get on till you ride to the top.

687
01:04:51,840 --> 01:04:57,233
Don't blow it, man. If you fall off,
it's the big wipe-out. Got it?

688
01:04:57,320 --> 01:04:59,436
Whoo! Bitchin'.

689
01:04:59,920 --> 01:05:01,876
Hang on, Snake.

690
01:05:26,560 --> 01:05:28,676
You got to be kidding me.

691
01:05:32,120 --> 01:05:33,758
Later.

692
01:05:33,840 --> 01:05:35,717
Ooh, Snake!

693
01:06:28,120 --> 01:06:31,510
Tell me how to get downtown -
somebody named Hershe.

694
01:06:31,600 --> 01:06:34,273
- Sure, Snake. No problem.
- Hey, hey!

695
01:06:34,360 --> 01:06:36,794
Are you going to kill me?

696
01:06:36,880 --> 01:06:38,518
Hershe.

697
01:06:38,600 --> 01:06:41,239
Right. Keep straight.
Two blocks down, right.

698
01:06:51,120 --> 01:06:54,749
Warning.
Neurosystem shut-down. One hour.

699
01:07:13,600 --> 01:07:16,353
I first met Hershe
when I got deported.

700
01:07:16,440 --> 01:07:19,830
She helped set me up.
We're talking a power player.

701
01:07:19,920 --> 01:07:24,994
Cuervo's got numbers and firepower,
but Hershe's got big-time ambitions.

702
01:07:25,080 --> 01:07:29,710
The two of you hooked up together,
I'm talking box-office material.

703
01:07:29,800 --> 01:07:31,552
What?

704
01:07:33,360 --> 01:07:37,433
Easy, Snake. I see him, too.
We're OK. Come on.

705
01:07:37,520 --> 01:07:40,671
She's going to love you, Snake.
You'll love her, too.

706
01:07:40,760 --> 01:07:42,830
We'll make this thing happen.

707
01:07:42,920 --> 01:07:46,674
I'm through with Cuervo. The guy's
got no sense of loyalty whatsoever.

708
01:07:46,760 --> 01:07:47,715
Through here.

709
01:07:49,400 --> 01:07:50,515
What?

710
01:07:50,600 --> 01:07:53,114
How you doin'? Long time, no see.

711
01:07:53,200 --> 01:07:55,668
Remember me? Map To The Stars Eddie.

712
01:07:55,760 --> 01:07:58,593
I got somebody I want Hershe to meet,

713
01:07:58,680 --> 01:08:01,638
Snake Plissken,
right here in the flesh.

714
01:08:02,680 --> 01:08:04,636
Your gun.

715
01:08:04,720 --> 01:08:06,676
Great. Thanks, pal.

716
01:08:10,720 --> 01:08:14,918
All right, we're in. Strange scene
here. Let me do the talking.

717
01:08:21,680 --> 01:08:23,910
Hey, Hershe, how you doin'?

718
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:27,276
Hang on, guys. This is big.
It's Snake Plissken.

719
01:08:27,360 --> 01:08:30,796
I brought him to see you, Hershe.
He's got a business proposition.

720
01:08:30,880 --> 01:08:34,429
- What's in it for me?
- Wait a minute.

721
01:08:37,120 --> 01:08:38,872
I know that voice.

722
01:08:40,840 --> 01:08:43,638
Yeah... You're Carjack Malone.

723
01:08:43,720 --> 01:08:46,109
Not any more.

724
01:08:46,200 --> 01:08:48,475
You two know each other?

725
01:08:54,880 --> 01:08:59,476
The more things change, the more
they stay the same, huh, Carjack?

726
01:08:59,560 --> 01:09:02,120
Still packing a gun
between your legs.

727
01:09:02,200 --> 01:09:04,156
Hold on, honey...

728
01:09:04,240 --> 01:09:06,231
You bolted on me in Cleveland.

729
01:09:06,320 --> 01:09:07,912
Hershe, you were in Cleveland?

730
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:11,993
With me and Texas Mike O'Shea.
You looked different then, Carjack.

731
01:09:12,080 --> 01:09:15,470
Get one thing straight.
I'm no longer Carjack Malone.

732
01:09:15,560 --> 01:09:19,348
I'm Hershe Las Palmas,
the most drop-dead number.

733
01:09:19,440 --> 01:09:21,954
What the hell happened in Cleveland?

734
01:09:22,040 --> 01:09:25,032
- I got caught and you didn't!
- Don't lie to me!

735
01:09:25,120 --> 01:09:29,272
So I made another deal! I've
been here five years, not you!

736
01:09:29,360 --> 01:09:32,796
I got a new deal.
You help me, you live.

737
01:09:32,880 --> 01:09:34,836
I wouldn't do that, Snake.

738
01:09:34,920 --> 01:09:37,673
See, anything happens to me,
and you're dead.

739
01:09:37,760 --> 01:09:40,228
I'm already dead.

740
01:09:40,680 --> 01:09:43,069
I see your point. What's the deal?

741
01:09:43,160 --> 01:09:45,594
Get me to Cuervo Jones.
I got one hour.

742
01:09:45,680 --> 01:09:47,432
Dream on, blue eye.

743
01:09:47,520 --> 01:09:49,317
Say good night, Carjack.

744
01:09:49,400 --> 01:09:53,632
Cuervo's got firepower.
No one gets near him.

745
01:09:53,720 --> 01:09:56,518
And he's got the black box
and the girl.

746
01:09:56,600 --> 01:09:59,876
- What black box?
- That shuts down the power.

747
01:09:59,960 --> 01:10:04,750
Oh, yeah, right! And the Plutoxin
Seven virus kills you in ten hours.

748
01:10:04,840 --> 01:10:06,717
- What?
- It's bullshit!

749
01:10:06,800 --> 01:10:09,951
Rumour control. Government
propaganda. Just one more lie.

750
01:10:10,040 --> 01:10:13,396
It's true. I represented
the guy who invented it.

751
01:10:14,880 --> 01:10:17,110
Swear to God, Snake.

752
01:10:17,200 --> 01:10:18,918
What's the deal, gorgeous?

753
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:21,070
Get the girl and the box,
and get out.

754
01:10:21,160 --> 01:10:23,116
All of us?

755
01:10:24,440 --> 01:10:27,159
- Yeah.
- Me, too?

756
01:10:27,240 --> 01:10:29,117
Why should we leave?

757
01:10:29,200 --> 01:10:31,509
I love LA.

758
01:10:31,600 --> 01:10:33,511
Where we gonna go?

759
01:10:33,600 --> 01:10:35,477
What's the big payoff?

760
01:10:35,560 --> 01:10:38,154
A million dollars
for whoever helps me.

761
01:10:38,240 --> 01:10:41,869
A million greenbacks?
I got ten million the next room.

762
01:10:41,960 --> 01:10:44,713
Uh-uh. Bluebacks.

763
01:10:44,800 --> 01:10:47,837
- Come on, Snake.
- Swear to God, Eddie.

764
01:10:48,880 --> 01:10:51,030
This is bigger than Cleveland.

765
01:10:51,120 --> 01:10:53,156
It sounds thin to me.

766
01:10:53,240 --> 01:10:55,959
You want Cuervo to rule the world?

767
01:10:56,040 --> 01:10:59,316
No. That sucks.
So how do we get out?

768
01:10:59,760 --> 01:11:02,320
I'll tell you that when we get there.

769
01:11:02,400 --> 01:11:05,198
Oh, Plissken, man,
you are such a loser!

770
01:11:05,280 --> 01:11:07,510
Making up shit along the way.

771
01:11:07,600 --> 01:11:10,034
That's why I left you in Cleveland.

772
01:11:10,120 --> 01:11:14,033
You're just a chump
like the rest of us. No deal!

773
01:11:14,120 --> 01:11:17,078
Government chopper. It'll be there.

774
01:11:17,160 --> 01:11:21,472
OK, that's better. How are we
getting there in an hour?

775
01:11:21,560 --> 01:11:23,516
That's your end.

776
01:11:27,240 --> 01:11:28,593
Edward.

777
01:11:28,680 --> 01:11:31,478
Best you could do is take the five.

778
01:11:31,560 --> 01:11:34,358
The shape it's in,
two and a half hours minimum.

779
01:11:34,440 --> 01:11:37,238
No. Use the air. They're burning.

780
01:11:37,320 --> 01:11:40,551
The Santa Anas. The night wind.

781
01:11:40,640 --> 01:11:43,950
- What are you talking about?
- Death from above.

782
01:12:03,440 --> 01:12:05,590
I don't know about this.

783
01:12:05,680 --> 01:12:08,069
You don't like it, don't come.

784
01:12:08,160 --> 01:12:10,355
Where'd you get these rigs, Carjack?

785
01:12:10,440 --> 01:12:13,034
My name is Hershe.
Understand, Plissken?

786
01:12:13,120 --> 01:12:15,111
I got an idea.

787
01:12:15,200 --> 01:12:17,156
Got any red nail polish?

788
01:12:17,240 --> 01:12:19,276
- What?
- Come on.

789
01:12:23,480 --> 01:12:26,074
I expect that back, Eddie.

790
01:12:31,200 --> 01:12:35,716
There. Looks just like the Sword
of Damocles instruction CD.

791
01:12:35,800 --> 01:12:38,598
Maybe we can pull a Texas switch.

792
01:12:38,680 --> 01:12:41,990
- If you get close enough.
- Don't worry.

793
01:12:42,800 --> 01:12:44,995
The wind's up. Let's go!

794
01:13:06,320 --> 01:13:07,275
Shut-down - 34 minutes.

795
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:58,673
Are you ready for the new world?

796
01:14:02,080 --> 01:14:04,958
The attack is now under way!

797
01:14:29,720 --> 01:14:32,757
- What's going on?
- We're fucked!

798
01:14:43,120 --> 01:14:45,076
You see Plissken anywhere?

799
01:14:47,480 --> 01:14:49,869
Shut-down - 25 minutes.

800
01:14:57,120 --> 01:15:00,430
Get my jet ready.
Get it fuelled ready to go.

801
01:15:02,560 --> 01:15:05,120
You can't run away. It's too late.

802
01:15:05,200 --> 01:15:07,760
You have to stand and face it down.

803
01:15:07,840 --> 01:15:09,239
Mr President.

804
01:15:09,320 --> 01:15:11,675
Commander, we're receiving reports.

805
01:15:11,760 --> 01:15:14,513
An armada of warships
has departed Cuba,

806
01:15:14,600 --> 01:15:16,556
ETA, Florida in 45 minutes.

807
01:15:16,640 --> 01:15:18,596
They're starting the invasion.

808
01:15:19,440 --> 01:15:21,556
I'm going to my quarters!

809
01:15:21,640 --> 01:15:23,596
I've got to pray!

810
01:15:24,600 --> 01:15:28,070
Go with him. Make sure
he doesn't do anything crazy.

811
01:15:42,200 --> 01:15:45,590
Hey, Eddie, is that
what I think it is?

812
01:15:45,680 --> 01:15:50,037
Yeah. It kept changing owners.
Finally went bankrupt.

813
01:15:50,120 --> 01:15:52,076
That thing in Paris killed them.

814
01:15:52,160 --> 01:15:54,116
We need a diversion.

815
01:15:59,120 --> 01:16:01,190
Hey, Cuervo! Hey!

816
01:16:02,880 --> 01:16:05,440
Hey, Cuervo! I made it!

817
01:16:05,520 --> 01:16:08,239
I made it! Wait for me! Whoa!

818
01:16:09,720 --> 01:16:11,676
Oh, shit!

819
01:16:19,280 --> 01:16:21,350
Hey, Cuervo!

820
01:16:21,440 --> 01:16:23,590
Will you please kill him for me?

821
01:16:23,680 --> 01:16:27,389
Hey! Hey! I got news!
There's about to be an attack!

822
01:16:27,480 --> 01:16:30,756
You're about to get hit, man.
It's Plissken.

823
01:16:33,240 --> 01:16:35,470
You told me you shot him dead.

824
01:16:35,560 --> 01:16:37,596
Yeah, I thought I did,

825
01:16:37,680 --> 01:16:40,752
but I found him... sort of... alive.

826
01:16:40,840 --> 01:16:42,796
Sort of. Where?

827
01:16:43,800 --> 01:16:45,995
- Oh, Cuervo.
- What?

828
01:16:46,080 --> 01:16:49,595
- It's so good to see you.
- Where is Plissken?!

829
01:16:49,680 --> 01:16:52,831
- He's near.
- You're stalling, Eddie.

830
01:16:52,920 --> 01:16:54,592
Aah! Jeez!

831
01:16:54,680 --> 01:16:58,036
Talk, gringo,
or I'll rip your balls off.

832
01:16:58,120 --> 01:17:00,076
Look out behind you!

833
01:17:15,880 --> 01:17:19,839
You have lied to me
for the very last time.

834
01:20:03,440 --> 01:20:05,715
Come on, hurry up! Let's go!

835
01:20:13,760 --> 01:20:16,718
Get inside the chopper.
It's bulletproof.

836
01:20:21,520 --> 01:20:24,114
I'll take my coat back now, asshole.

837
01:20:41,680 --> 01:20:44,114
- Take me back.
- Secure the latch.

838
01:20:47,120 --> 01:20:49,076
You got the remote. Great.

839
01:20:49,160 --> 01:20:51,196
Yeah. Give me the real one.

840
01:20:51,280 --> 01:20:53,236
I didn't make a switch.

841
01:20:53,320 --> 01:20:55,356
Yes, you did. I saw you.

842
01:20:57,120 --> 01:20:59,076
Give me that gun!

843
01:21:27,120 --> 01:21:30,590
Damn it. Carjack, we're hooked up
on your side.

844
01:22:00,040 --> 01:22:02,190
I hit him!

845
01:22:26,200 --> 01:22:27,553
Get back here, Plissken!

846
01:22:29,280 --> 01:22:31,111
Aircraft entering quadrant four, sir.

847
01:22:31,200 --> 01:22:34,636
- I'm getting radio contact.
- Boost it.

848
01:22:34,720 --> 01:22:37,109
Get the antidote ready, assholes!

849
01:22:37,200 --> 01:22:39,316
Plissken, do you have the box?

850
01:22:39,400 --> 01:22:42,472
I got the remote control unit
and instruction disk.

851
01:22:42,560 --> 01:22:44,755
Get the trucks, we're on fire.

852
01:22:44,840 --> 01:22:48,276
Shut-down, two minutes, 27 seconds.

853
01:22:48,360 --> 01:22:51,955
All emergency vehicles,
proceed to the north perimeter.

854
01:22:58,440 --> 01:23:00,670
Shit! Shit!

855
01:23:05,840 --> 01:23:07,990
This is a full alert.

856
01:23:10,600 --> 01:23:12,989
Where the hell is he going?

857
01:23:13,560 --> 01:23:15,516
Get ready to jump.

858
01:23:15,600 --> 01:23:18,273
Head for the tree line and disappear.

859
01:23:19,760 --> 01:23:20,715
Go.

860
01:23:20,800 --> 01:23:22,631
Go!

861
01:24:23,120 --> 01:24:24,997
Oh, thank God almighty!

862
01:24:25,080 --> 01:24:26,832
Thank God almighty!

863
01:24:26,920 --> 01:24:28,751
Welcome back, sir.

864
01:24:28,840 --> 01:24:30,796
Give me the goddam shot.

865
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:42,869
Your countdown clock has now
terminated function. Your time is up.

866
01:24:44,720 --> 01:24:47,632
I told you he was dumb.

867
01:24:47,720 --> 01:24:49,676
You took the fake, hotshot.

868
01:24:49,760 --> 01:24:53,514
Plutoxin Seven is a fast,
hard-hitting case of the flu.

869
01:24:54,680 --> 01:24:56,432
Pretty good.

870
01:24:56,520 --> 01:24:57,999
Relax, war hero.

871
01:24:58,080 --> 01:25:02,073
We took you for a little ride,
and you came through.

872
01:25:02,160 --> 01:25:04,799
Now, give me that unit.

873
01:25:13,480 --> 01:25:15,436
You want this thing?

874
01:25:15,840 --> 01:25:17,796
Come and get it.

875
01:25:19,240 --> 01:25:22,038
- Sir...
- What can he do?

876
01:25:22,120 --> 01:25:24,759
Let go of me! Quit it!

877
01:25:31,720 --> 01:25:34,359
You didn't finish the mission, Snake.

878
01:25:34,440 --> 01:25:37,876
Looks like I'll have
to do it for you.

879
01:25:45,120 --> 01:25:47,076
Hold it, Mr President.

880
01:26:04,320 --> 01:26:06,072
Shit.

881
01:26:11,040 --> 01:26:12,996
We'll take this one.

882
01:26:23,600 --> 01:26:25,556
Get her out of here.

883
01:26:25,640 --> 01:26:27,278
Daddy...

884
01:26:27,360 --> 01:26:29,715
Take her to the chair.

885
01:26:35,960 --> 01:26:39,270
For he so loved his country...

886
01:26:39,360 --> 01:26:42,796
he gave his only seditious child.

887
01:26:47,440 --> 01:26:49,396
Prepare to broadcast...

888
01:26:50,360 --> 01:26:52,316
worldwide.

889
01:26:53,640 --> 01:26:55,596
Worldwide!

890
01:26:57,080 --> 01:27:01,517
She didn't know that she had it
in her pocket, did she?

891
01:27:01,600 --> 01:27:05,991
I was wondering what kind of
lame switch you'd try to pull.

892
01:27:06,080 --> 01:27:08,116
You're becoming very predictable.

893
01:27:10,120 --> 01:27:12,076
Yeah, I guess so.

894
01:27:12,840 --> 01:27:14,796
You got a smoke?

895
01:27:14,880 --> 01:27:17,713
The United States
is a no-smoking nation.

896
01:27:17,800 --> 01:27:21,918
No smoking, no drinking, no drugs,
no women-unless you're married.

897
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:25,356
No guns, no foul language,
no red meat.

898
01:27:25,440 --> 01:27:27,635
The land of the free.

899
01:27:31,280 --> 01:27:33,236
I don't need the teleprompter.

900
01:27:33,320 --> 01:27:36,869
This is the President
of the United States.

901
01:27:36,960 --> 01:27:41,272
I now demand an immediate
retreat of all forces

902
01:27:41,360 --> 01:27:43,999
now threatening
this great nation.

903
01:27:44,080 --> 01:27:47,675
If my demand is not met immediately,

904
01:27:47,760 --> 01:27:52,959
I will destroy your ability
to function permanently.

905
01:27:53,040 --> 01:27:57,192
Mr President, the Cuban aggression
remains mobile. ETA, four minutes.

906
01:27:57,280 --> 01:27:58,759
Four minutes.

907
01:27:58,840 --> 01:28:03,197
Bring the aiming co-ordinates
for Cuba and Mexico online.

908
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:08,673
Cuba-seven, seven, nine.

909
01:28:08,760 --> 01:28:11,399
Seven... seven...

910
01:28:11,480 --> 01:28:13,232
nine.

911
01:28:14,920 --> 01:28:19,038
I now render this final solution.

912
01:28:20,480 --> 01:28:23,870
Welcome to your own map to the stars.

913
01:28:23,960 --> 01:28:28,192
The big one wiped out
the entertainment industry in LA,

914
01:28:28,280 --> 01:28:31,511
but the glamour
of Hollywood is still alive...

915
01:28:31,600 --> 01:28:33,556
Very funny.

916
01:28:35,880 --> 01:28:38,155
I hope it was worth it,

917
01:28:38,240 --> 01:28:40,993
for now you are going to die.

918
01:28:41,080 --> 01:28:43,594
Everybody does.

919
01:28:43,680 --> 01:28:45,636
Kill him...

920
01:28:45,720 --> 01:28:49,235
and bring me the real unit.

921
01:28:49,320 --> 01:28:52,756
- Sir, we're still broadcasting.
- Good! Let them watch!

922
01:28:54,040 --> 01:28:55,792
Do it!

923
01:28:58,080 --> 01:28:59,274
Do it!

924
01:29:00,760 --> 01:29:02,239
On my command!

925
01:29:04,800 --> 01:29:06,199
Fire!

926
01:29:26,120 --> 01:29:29,351
He's not even here! He's a hologram!

927
01:29:31,040 --> 01:29:32,758
She catches on quick.

928
01:29:33,920 --> 01:29:38,118
Got to be within a half-mile radius.
Round up every available man.

929
01:29:38,200 --> 01:29:40,031
Hold it.

930
01:29:40,120 --> 01:29:43,874
Sir, the enemy is less than
two minutes from our shore.

931
01:29:43,960 --> 01:29:47,191
What's it to be, Plissken -
us or them?

932
01:29:48,760 --> 01:29:52,639
Shut down the Third World.
They lose, you win.

933
01:29:52,720 --> 01:29:54,950
Shut down America...

934
01:29:55,040 --> 01:29:57,395
you lose, they win.

935
01:29:57,480 --> 01:30:01,996
The more things change,
the more they stay the same.

936
01:30:02,080 --> 01:30:04,355
So what are you going to do?

937
01:30:04,440 --> 01:30:06,317
Disappear.

938
01:30:16,320 --> 01:30:18,276
He's entered the world code.

939
01:30:20,960 --> 01:30:22,951
No target code.

940
01:30:26,480 --> 01:30:29,517
Sir, that will shut down
the entire planet.

941
01:30:31,640 --> 01:30:34,916
I told you you'd better hope
I didn't make it back.

942
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:40,233
You push that button, 500 years'
worth of work will be finished.

943
01:30:40,320 --> 01:30:44,393
Our technology, our way of life,
our entire history.

944
01:30:44,480 --> 01:30:47,278
We'll have to start all over again.

945
01:30:50,360 --> 01:30:53,113
For God's sakes, don't do it, Snake!

946
01:30:54,520 --> 01:30:56,590
The name's Plissken.

947
01:31:12,760 --> 01:31:14,352
He did it.

948
01:31:14,440 --> 01:31:16,908
He shut down the Earth.

949
01:32:32,880 --> 01:32:34,233
Welcome to the human race.

950
01:36:28,920 --> 01:36:32,390
