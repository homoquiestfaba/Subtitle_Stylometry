1
00:01:36,513 --> 00:01:39,224
we knew there were others out there

2
00:01:39,224 --> 00:01:43,353
who felt adamant against increasing
our self-defense military power.

3
00:01:43,353 --> 00:01:46,439
We knew they’d take action against us if we had.

4
00:01:46,481 --> 00:01:49,067
How could we have gauged how they would react?

5
00:01:49,067 --> 00:01:52,821
They are crazy. Their actions aren’t always logical.

6
00:01:52,821 --> 00:01:56,950
They shoot random missiles all
around the world for no reason.

7
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:58,701
But they haven't declared "war”--

8
00:01:58,743 --> 00:02:00,286
It's Yuichi.

9
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:02,664
We are in danger because we underestimated them

10
00:02:02,664 --> 00:02:04,624
and now we don’t have a plan to fight back.

11
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:05,959
So... but...

12
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:08,753
Should we live in constant fear of them?

13
00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:11,506
I never said fear them.

14
00:02:11,506 --> 00:02:14,634
We must become more cautious with our immigrants--

15
00:02:14,676 --> 00:02:15,468
Are you eating?

16
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:16,636
No, I’m fine.

17
00:02:16,928 --> 00:02:17,846
Hey!

18
00:02:17,846 --> 00:02:21,182
-screen who’s entered and do
thorough background checks.

19
00:02:21,224 --> 00:02:25,353
Keep tabs on every single foreigner in the country?

20
00:02:25,353 --> 00:02:27,397
Now I know you're insane.

21
00:02:27,397 --> 00:02:32,443
Some may have come in using a fake identity.

22
00:02:32,443 --> 00:02:34,279
What you're suggesting is a surveillance society.

23
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:36,239
Stop putting words in my mouth.

24
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:40,410
I'm pointing out flaws in our system
that should be revised--

25
00:02:55,216 --> 00:02:58,094
-people are getting impatient with the media--

26
00:02:58,136 --> 00:02:59,470
Is he home?

27
00:02:59,637 --> 00:03:03,474
-they feel as though they aren't
getting enough information--

28
00:03:03,516 --> 00:03:04,601
Can you help her?

29
00:03:04,976 --> 00:03:06,811
It’s fine, I got it.

30
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:09,731
Aren’t you two up early for another live show tomorrow?

31
00:03:10,231 --> 00:03:13,276
Better get to bed. You too, mother.

32
00:03:14,652 --> 00:03:19,073
-we never seem to have an answer
for any tragedy or crime--

33
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,825
...Yes, of course.

34
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:23,828
-they don’t know who to turn their anger towards--

35
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:32,879
-how do we fight back without stooping to their level?

36
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:36,382
What will help us get our hostage back?

37
00:03:36,507 --> 00:03:40,970
It must be an unimaginable time for Tetsuya's family...

38
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:42,263
That's right.

39
00:03:42,764 --> 00:03:45,516
I certainly feel odd about calling him a "hostage."

40
00:03:45,558 --> 00:03:47,143
Why is that?

41
00:03:47,185 --> 00:03:49,562
There's no proof that these abductions are--

42
00:03:57,195 --> 00:03:59,322
Last month on a cold winter day

43
00:03:59,322 --> 00:04:02,825
our youngest brother was taken from us.

44
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:08,581
When our parents were younger, a series
of abduction cases terrorized Japan.

45
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:12,502
The abductees were victims of an international conflict
that had nothing to do with their lives.

46
00:04:12,502 --> 00:04:16,089
30 years later, they stole from us yet
another innocent civilian.

47
00:04:16,673 --> 00:04:18,383
This time, a 14-year-old boy.

48
00:04:18,383 --> 00:04:19,926
My brother.

49
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:22,845
It became clear that the kidnapper abducted Tetsuya

50
00:04:22,845 --> 00:04:25,265
when he released a video confessing to the crime.

51
00:04:25,848 --> 00:04:29,435
It was a form of protest against the Japanese
government and their decision to

52
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:31,854
strengthen the country’s self-defense
military force.

53
00:04:32,355 --> 00:04:35,650
My parents immediately contacted the police.

54
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:38,528
They joined the "Association of the Families."

55
00:04:38,528 --> 00:04:40,405
We publicized our loss.

56
00:04:40,989 --> 00:04:43,658
The media picked this up immediately.

57
00:04:43,658 --> 00:04:45,451
Tetsuya was popular.

58
00:04:45,451 --> 00:04:48,454
He always got good grades in school.

59
00:04:48,454 --> 00:04:50,999
He was the star of his soccer team.

60
00:04:50,999 --> 00:04:52,667
People loved him.

61
00:04:53,167 --> 00:04:57,380
It was easy to sympathize for
the loss of such a great kid.

62
00:04:57,714 --> 00:04:59,048
...Or so it seemed.

63
00:04:59,757 --> 00:05:02,760
It only took a handful of people on social media

64
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:06,681
to plant seeds of doubt in everyone's mind.

65
00:05:08,224 --> 00:05:10,893
People found out that my father is a journalist

66
00:05:10,893 --> 00:05:14,397
known for his radically conservative work.

67
00:05:14,897 --> 00:05:17,942
They began to make accusations.

68
00:05:18,359 --> 00:05:21,738
“Staged Abduction: The Journalist Lied for a Story.”

69
00:05:21,738 --> 00:05:23,573
They toyed with the news,

70
00:05:24,115 --> 00:05:27,702
making up rumors based on what
they read and saw online.

71
00:05:28,202 --> 00:05:30,788
The accusations spread like rapid fire.

72
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:32,957
"Coincidence or Faux?"

73
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:37,962
Moreover, people became extra skeptical when they found out
my parents were separated some time ago.

74
00:05:37,962 --> 00:05:41,466
Because it meant we weren't one big happy family,
there were reasons to find us suspicious.

75
00:05:41,466 --> 00:05:42,508
Also...

76
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:55,855
Sorry.

77
00:05:57,815 --> 00:06:00,360
The public's been hardest on Yuichi.

78
00:06:01,152 --> 00:06:03,321
As if nothing happened

79
00:06:03,321 --> 00:06:06,324
Yuichi suddenly picked up boxing again.

80
00:06:07,075 --> 00:06:10,745
He appeared to be insensitive to the situation,
almost mindlessly aggressive

81
00:06:10,745 --> 00:06:14,832
which made him an easy target for
public harassment.

82
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:19,170
I see him practice day and night without explanation.

83
00:06:19,504 --> 00:06:24,509
He never talked about his intentions or his
feelings on Tetsuya's disappearance.

84
00:06:24,842 --> 00:06:29,138
Except for a favor from us--

85
00:06:31,599 --> 00:06:34,102
I'm fighting a match next month on the 15th.

86
00:06:34,102 --> 00:06:35,395
Please come.

87
00:06:55,456 --> 00:06:58,876
-They're out!
-Mr. Hiiragi!

88
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:01,712
-Would you say you communicate well with your family?
-Are you close?

89
00:07:01,754 --> 00:07:03,297
What are some things that weren't said?

90
00:07:03,339 --> 00:07:04,132
Excuse us.

91
00:07:04,173 --> 00:07:05,800
Give us something!

92
00:07:05,842 --> 00:07:08,719
We are being interviewed live on the news today.

93
00:07:08,719 --> 00:07:10,972
We will answer your questions afterwards.

94
00:07:11,013 --> 00:07:13,307
Tell us about you and your wife's separation!

95
00:07:13,349 --> 00:07:15,268
Why were you separated for 16 years ago?

96
00:07:15,309 --> 00:07:18,896
Did Tetsuya know? How did it affect him?

97
00:07:24,527 --> 00:07:25,319
Look.

98
00:07:26,028 --> 00:07:27,697
Heartless... look at him...

99
00:07:28,197 --> 00:07:30,616
He acts like a bystander.

100
00:07:30,616 --> 00:07:32,410
...#BoxingBrother...

101
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:36,497
I guess he doesn't give a damn, huh?

102
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:45,173
Wanna stick around for a bit and see what happens?

103
00:07:45,214 --> 00:07:46,757
Could be interesting.

104
00:07:54,098 --> 00:07:55,975
Relax, they’re gone.

105
00:07:58,561 --> 00:07:59,937
Can’t blame them.

106
00:07:59,937 --> 00:08:02,607
I did similar things back in the day.

107
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:06,068
Might have been worse.

108
00:08:06,861 --> 00:08:09,238
We all just want the truth.

109
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:13,993
They are expecting us to mess up.

110
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:16,829
Especially now since the rumors began.

111
00:08:16,871 --> 00:08:20,500
That's why we have to prove
ourselves now. Am I right?

112
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:24,837
We don’t have time for this kind of crap.

113
00:08:24,962 --> 00:08:26,881
There are more grave things to worry about.

114
00:08:26,923 --> 00:08:29,717
As we have discussed

115
00:08:30,801 --> 00:08:33,304
it will only add fuel to the fire if we fight back with words.

116
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:35,389
And don't you think I as a journalist

117
00:08:35,389 --> 00:08:38,851
have an obligation to not play into their bullshit?

118
00:08:40,728 --> 00:08:42,897
Listen, just let me do all the talking today.

119
00:08:42,897 --> 00:08:46,567
You just answer whatever they ask you.

120
00:08:47,902 --> 00:08:50,780
Oh sure, because we women sound
hysterical when we’re defensive.

121
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:51,864
Right?

122
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,033
How old.

123
00:08:54,992 --> 00:08:58,621
How do you plan to explain the boxing?

124
00:09:22,728 --> 00:09:24,105
Good morning.

125
00:09:24,146 --> 00:09:25,731
Good morning.

126
00:09:35,491 --> 00:09:38,578
Hey, did we make any progress since yesterday
towards hiring the new grads?

127
00:09:41,205 --> 00:09:42,290
Um, no...

128
00:09:43,124 --> 00:09:44,166
...okay.

129
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:16,324
Hey! Aren’t you Yuichi? Yuichi Hiiragi?

130
00:10:16,365 --> 00:10:18,200
You are!

131
00:10:18,409 --> 00:10:20,536
Hey man, why don't you stop and talk to us!

132
00:10:20,578 --> 00:10:21,329
Mr. Hiiragi?

133
00:10:24,332 --> 00:10:27,209
Are you leaving for practice?

134
00:10:27,877 --> 00:10:30,671
What’s up with all the practices?

135
00:10:30,671 --> 00:10:33,549
Aren’t you worried about your brother?

136
00:10:33,758 --> 00:10:37,136
You know the whole world’s
watching you right now on this?

137
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:40,139
Are you admitting that the rumors are true? Is it all fake?

138
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:53,819
It feels so much colder all the sudden.

139
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,657
I got you coffee.

140
00:10:58,574 --> 00:11:01,577
I think we still have the blanket
we got last year somewhere.

141
00:11:01,577 --> 00:11:03,496
Should I go get...

142
00:11:04,997 --> 00:11:06,916
Tetsuya had a life we weren't aware of...

143
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:08,459
...wife and I both work...

144
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:10,670
...his older siblings live on their own...

145
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:13,130
...couldn’t keep track of everything...

146
00:11:19,428 --> 00:11:21,055
It's fine, it's fine.

147
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:44,370
"Boxing Brother"

148
00:11:54,588 --> 00:11:55,631
Kaede.

149
00:12:04,849 --> 00:12:07,977
I want to start off by saying,
you are a great employee.

150
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:11,230
You’ve got a great reputation in our company

151
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:14,567
and your work ethic is admirable...

152
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:17,903
And of course, this...

153
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:24,410
...what I'm about to do isn't a
reflection on your performance.

154
00:12:26,829 --> 00:12:28,038
It's just... currently...

155
00:12:28,497 --> 00:12:31,584
You must understand, we are
an advertising agency.

156
00:12:31,834 --> 00:12:34,712
We have to uphold a certain appearance.

157
00:12:35,671 --> 00:12:41,260
Your family has been
quite the topic in the media these days...

158
00:12:42,303 --> 00:12:45,973
Although, I understand you can't help it,
for the sake of the company...

159
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:46,891
Right.

160
00:12:47,975 --> 00:12:49,143
Of course.

161
00:12:50,186 --> 00:12:53,731
I'm sorry, I was also thinking
I should take some time to

162
00:12:53,939 --> 00:12:57,693
think about what more I can
do for my little brother.

163
00:12:58,194 --> 00:13:01,363
I'm terribly sorry if this has inconvenienced
the company in any way...

164
00:13:02,072 --> 00:13:04,617
Of course, of course.

165
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:09,747
I'm glad you feel that way too.

166
00:13:10,831 --> 00:13:14,794
I'm sure you will get through this.
You just have to keep it up...

167
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:17,963
Mr. Hiiragi.

168
00:13:20,216 --> 00:13:23,052
It is probably true that there isn't
a single person out there today

169
00:13:23,052 --> 00:13:27,097
who doesn't know about what you're going through.

170
00:13:28,349 --> 00:13:32,520
Many of us deeply sympathize with your situation

171
00:13:32,978 --> 00:13:40,194
and are saddened by this repeated tragedy.

172
00:13:41,195 --> 00:13:42,780
At the same time, however

173
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:45,407
a lot of us are baffled by a certain rumor

174
00:13:45,407 --> 00:13:48,994
that has spread across the internet.

175
00:13:49,537 --> 00:13:52,998
Today you were invited here to share
with us your side of the story

176
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:57,044
Are our intentions clear and are we ready to begin?

177
00:13:57,586 --> 00:13:58,212
Yes.

178
00:13:59,004 --> 00:14:00,214
Certainly.

179
00:14:00,714 --> 00:14:02,716
Mr. Hiiragi

180
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:08,681
in the past 15 years you have built
yourself quite a reputation

181
00:14:09,265 --> 00:14:11,600
as a conservative journalist.

182
00:14:11,725 --> 00:14:14,770
You are well known for your radical
approach to criticizing anyone that

183
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:16,939
presents opposing opinions to you.

184
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:20,276
The articles you write actively oppress any

185
00:14:20,276 --> 00:14:22,820
ideas or movements that disagree with the government.

186
00:14:24,446 --> 00:14:26,699
We won’t beat around the bush here.

187
00:14:27,825 --> 00:14:31,704
The rumor says the kidnapping of
your son is a made-up story

188
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:35,082
to fuel some type of a political revolution in Japan.

189
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:36,542
Is that true?

190
00:14:37,293 --> 00:14:40,212
That is completely untrue. It is a baseless rumor.

191
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:43,883
As a journalist, I have always upheld the dignity of truth.

192
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:47,636
I would never abuse my power of
freedom of speech and expression

193
00:14:47,636 --> 00:14:50,180
by disrespecting the privacy of my subjects.

194
00:14:50,306 --> 00:14:54,810
I have always done what is right
and respectable under the law.

195
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:57,396
To be accused of using my own son

196
00:14:57,396 --> 00:15:00,232
in a matter of politics is appalling and abusive.

197
00:15:00,816 --> 00:15:03,736
It is abusive to me, to my family
and all of the past victims.

198
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:06,739
What do you have to say

199
00:15:07,072 --> 00:15:08,490
Mrs. Hiiragi?

200
00:15:11,702 --> 00:15:14,872
I don't blame the people on social media.

201
00:15:14,872 --> 00:15:18,250
I understand that you are curious and
engaged in this issue at hand.

202
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:22,838
But please realize that your insensitive actions

203
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:28,260
directly affect the work of
the "Association of the Families" as well.

204
00:15:28,844 --> 00:15:34,683
How can you think that we would use our
14-year-old son in a matter of politics?

205
00:15:37,353 --> 00:15:39,188
Tetsuya is our son.

206
00:15:39,188 --> 00:15:40,481
Not our tool!

207
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:42,524
Okay.

208
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:46,028
Moving along.

209
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:50,658
We may touch upon some sensitive subjects here on out.

210
00:15:50,658 --> 00:15:58,207
We have information that your marriage was
once on the verge of a break

211
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:01,919
and that some issues have never been resolved.

212
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:03,462
Also

213
00:16:04,254 --> 00:16:07,591
we've recently conducted interviews
with Tetsuya's classmates

214
00:16:08,092 --> 00:16:10,594
and they revealed to us that
Tetsuya often didn't want to go home.

215
00:16:10,844 --> 00:16:14,807
Instead, he stayed out late, gambling,
smoking or sometimes even drinking.

216
00:16:15,057 --> 00:16:17,309
Do you have anything to say about that?

217
00:16:17,601 --> 00:16:20,938
It is true that my wife and I were
briefly separated in the past

218
00:16:21,689 --> 00:16:23,357
but that was before we had Tetsuya.

219
00:16:23,357 --> 00:16:25,526
It’s got nothing to do with my son.

220
00:16:27,778 --> 00:16:31,615
In our family, my wife and I have always
done what's best for the children.

221
00:16:32,074 --> 00:16:34,660
Sure, things were not perfect,
but we always tried our absolute best.

222
00:16:34,868 --> 00:16:38,914
I can insist we have never had any serious...

223
00:16:40,582 --> 00:16:41,875
...problems...

224
00:16:47,423 --> 00:16:51,051
Yes, it seems like Tetsuya had a life we weren't aware of.

225
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:55,180
My wife and I both work full time,
and both of his older siblings live on their own.

226
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:57,433
As I've explained in past interviews

227
00:16:57,433 --> 00:17:00,185
there was no way to keep track of everything he did.

228
00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:05,065
So perhaps he acted out because he was lonely.

229
00:17:05,107 --> 00:17:06,984
That is one possibility.

230
00:17:06,984 --> 00:17:10,779
One that my wife and I would deeply regret if so.

231
00:17:11,572 --> 00:17:16,368
Our following questions are on Tetsuya's siblings.

232
00:17:18,078 --> 00:17:19,663
Your daughter is working

233
00:17:19,663 --> 00:17:22,708
and your eldest son is a University student?

234
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:23,834
That is correct.

235
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:26,962
Are you two aware that this other son of yours

236
00:17:26,962 --> 00:17:32,718
has recently become a prime
subject on social media?

237
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:33,635
Yes.

238
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:38,057
First of all, exposing my son's name and identity
without his permission in a public ambush

239
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:41,143
is a violation to his privacy. It is illegal.
He can sue them.

240
00:17:41,143 --> 00:17:46,065
Secondly, my son is an adult. We are no longer
responsible for his actions

241
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:48,192
or what he does with his own time.

242
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:49,568
Though Mr. Hiiragi

243
00:17:50,027 --> 00:17:52,196
it seems like just a couple of hours ago

244
00:17:52,196 --> 00:17:55,032
your son was involved in a confrontation of a sort...

245
00:17:55,324 --> 00:17:58,786
Two web journalists who were doing a live coverage

246
00:17:58,786 --> 00:18:03,791
have reported that they were hit by your son.

247
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:06,376
They recorded a video of him violently

248
00:18:06,376 --> 00:18:09,880
confronting the reporters and that video has gone viral...

249
00:18:10,214 --> 00:18:14,093
Unfortunately, we are unable to stream the video here...

250
00:18:15,803 --> 00:18:18,263
...What video? Let me see.

251
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:22,726
The video is currently unavailable to us.

252
00:18:23,018 --> 00:18:26,063
It is stated here that your son exclaimed

253
00:18:26,063 --> 00:18:30,776
"if you want to know the truth about Tetsuya,
come to my match on the 15th!"

254
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:33,737
Then he went on to attack the reporters...

255
00:18:34,571 --> 00:18:37,241
This "match"... we assume that it is about boxing.

256
00:18:37,241 --> 00:18:40,577
Is this what he's been training for these past few weeks?

257
00:18:41,036 --> 00:18:49,211
Mr. Hiiragi? What does this boxing have
to do with Tetsuya's disappearance?

258
00:18:49,586 --> 00:18:55,008
Why does your son act so
provocative towards the public?

259
00:18:58,303 --> 00:18:59,555
Mr. Hiiragi

260
00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:04,810
you insisted your family has a good relationship

261
00:19:06,311 --> 00:19:07,688
but in reality

262
00:19:07,688 --> 00:19:12,526
it appears that you know nothing about them.

263
00:19:37,134 --> 00:19:38,719
Ayyy.

264
00:19:39,928 --> 00:19:42,055
You're still at it!

265
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:54,359
...It's been a while man.

266
00:19:57,196 --> 00:20:00,157
Dammit, left the lights on again.

267
00:20:00,824 --> 00:20:02,075
C'mon in, take a seat.

268
00:20:06,496 --> 00:20:10,417
I got the video for you.
You've been so serious about it

269
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:12,878
totally worth going out there.

270
00:20:13,378 --> 00:20:18,383
Still not sure if you'll win, though!

271
00:20:20,302 --> 00:20:21,595
Is this Sanders?

272
00:20:23,138 --> 00:20:27,351
Oh, you recognize him? He's my favorite.

273
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:37,110
I gotta say though. Sanders is coming to an end too.

274
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:38,946
He's just not making cash.

275
00:20:39,613 --> 00:20:40,781
Oh yeah?

276
00:20:41,156 --> 00:20:43,575
I guess I haven’t been keeping up.

277
00:20:43,617 --> 00:20:47,412
You have to man.
New rookies come into play every year.

278
00:20:47,454 --> 00:20:48,997
-live interview at Eleven Today News.

279
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:53,043
Their effort to reconcile misunderstandings
to the general public

280
00:20:53,043 --> 00:20:57,172
ended up revealing a deeper issue
rooted within their familial matters.

281
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:03,804
A month after Tetsuya's disappearance, assumably--

282
00:21:03,845 --> 00:21:05,305
All in one gulp.

283
00:21:05,347 --> 00:21:09,184
-for his personal gain as a political journalist.

284
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:12,187
Coming up next.

285
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:16,650
Tetsuya Hiiragi disappeared last month.

286
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:18,568
A few days later a video went viral with--

287
00:21:22,698 --> 00:21:26,368
I'm guessing it's pretty rough for you now, huh.

288
00:21:26,702 --> 00:21:29,579
I mean I don't really watch TV, so I don't know.

289
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,331
I guess...

290
00:21:32,916 --> 00:21:35,168
I can't imagine what it must be like
to lose your brother.

291
00:21:35,961 --> 00:21:37,796
Like, actually have no idea though.

292
00:21:37,796 --> 00:21:39,298
Cause I'm an only child.

293
00:21:45,387 --> 00:21:48,390
Alright. This is Mizoguchi today.

294
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,392
I told him I'm a freshman and that I'm a fan.

295
00:21:50,392 --> 00:21:52,060
He let me shoot him no problem.

296
00:21:57,441 --> 00:21:58,317
Look at that.

297
00:21:59,026 --> 00:22:00,861
Isn't it cinematic?!

298
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,781
Here! You see that?

299
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:10,203
His punches are fast, but it always leaves
his lower left wide open.

300
00:22:11,038 --> 00:22:11,913
There! Again.

301
00:22:12,706 --> 00:22:15,334
He always does that. Even during tournaments.

302
00:22:15,876 --> 00:22:17,711
I have footage of that too if you wanna see.

303
00:22:17,753 --> 00:22:18,378
Yeah.

304
00:22:30,974 --> 00:22:33,810
-and today we have two very special
guests as commentators

305
00:22:33,810 --> 00:22:35,354
a world championship winner--

306
00:22:35,437 --> 00:22:37,314
Why did you turn the light out?!

307
00:22:37,356 --> 00:22:38,899
Come here Kaede.

308
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:41,360
Look at that.

309
00:22:41,902 --> 00:22:43,403
It's so cinematic.

310
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:47,657
I don't know if this is what Kaede wants to see.

311
00:22:47,741 --> 00:22:49,117
-announces the two fighters to--

312
00:22:49,868 --> 00:22:52,662
"This journalist is an egotistical fuck."

313
00:22:52,662 --> 00:22:54,373
"NO ONE LIKES YOU DIE LIAR DIE"

314
00:22:54,373 --> 00:22:57,459
"Despicable people. They don't deserve to be on the news."

315
00:22:57,459 --> 00:22:59,544
What are you doing?! Stay away!

316
00:22:59,586 --> 00:23:01,713
Back up! Don’t touch the camera.

317
00:23:01,755 --> 00:23:05,258
You wanna know the truth?
If you wanna know the damn truth...

318
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:07,594
Are you training to hit innocent people?

319
00:23:08,887 --> 00:23:13,100
To me, it seems like each of us are
trying to find our own answers.

320
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:14,518
But the more we try

321
00:23:14,518 --> 00:23:16,978
we are only getting further from the solution...

322
00:23:18,688 --> 00:23:20,774
Each day is a struggle

323
00:23:20,774 --> 00:23:25,904
and by the end of the day, it's only
more apparent how powerless I am.

324
00:23:25,904 --> 00:23:28,573
We cling onto the smallest things that
show us any sign of hope.

325
00:23:28,573 --> 00:23:30,450
Usually amounts to nothing.

326
00:23:31,118 --> 00:23:32,786
After days and weeks of it

327
00:23:33,286 --> 00:23:35,664
I face moments in my day where I just

328
00:23:35,664 --> 00:23:39,584
don't want to care anymore...

329
00:23:41,878 --> 00:23:44,756
Tetsuya was stolen from our lives.

330
00:23:45,215 --> 00:23:48,051
It's not our fault. There is no point in blaming myself

331
00:23:48,802 --> 00:23:52,472
or anyone, except for the one who did it.

332
00:23:52,806 --> 00:23:56,518
Is it fair that I have to sacrifice my life
because of what happened?

333
00:23:56,518 --> 00:24:01,314
Can't I live separately from this incident?

334
00:24:02,023 --> 00:24:04,067
Can I forget about Tetsuya...?

335
00:24:05,861 --> 00:24:09,489
Maybe Yuichi realized this before any of us...

336
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:19,249
But...

337
00:24:32,345 --> 00:24:35,974
"How Can You Accept Peace in Your Heart?"

338
00:24:35,974 --> 00:24:39,519
"It All Begins with a Little Faith in World Peace."

339
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:06,463
Good morning.

340
00:25:07,589 --> 00:25:08,340
Hi.

341
00:25:10,175 --> 00:25:13,261
I woke up this morning to an email from
the "Association of the Families."

342
00:25:13,887 --> 00:25:16,431
They're folding a thousand origami paper cranes.

343
00:25:17,557 --> 00:25:20,393
I ran to the store to get some myself.

344
00:25:39,996 --> 00:25:41,873
Where will they hang it?

345
00:25:42,165 --> 00:25:44,084
What will this do?

346
00:25:44,793 --> 00:25:46,419
I don't know sweetheart...

347
00:25:46,962 --> 00:25:49,548
But if we make it, the news may pick it up...

348
00:25:50,882 --> 00:25:53,760
...maybe Tetsuya will hear about it too, somewhere.

349
00:25:53,969 --> 00:25:54,886
And?

350
00:25:55,762 --> 00:25:58,265
What happens then?

351
00:25:59,307 --> 00:26:01,977
How can we know what'll happen in the future?

352
00:26:01,977 --> 00:26:05,438
Maybe Tetsuya will be back home by then.

353
00:26:09,609 --> 00:26:14,990
No matter what we say on the news,
it won't make a difference.

354
00:26:16,616 --> 00:26:20,537
We have to keep trying new things
and pray for the best.

355
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:27,919
Sure.

356
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:30,463
Things that'll be "effective beyond words."

357
00:26:59,367 --> 00:27:02,912
Dad’s awake right? Yuichi too?

358
00:27:04,039 --> 00:27:04,831
Yeah.

359
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:07,709
I think Yuichi went for a run.

360
00:27:08,084 --> 00:27:10,086
Oh, that's right...

361
00:27:11,004 --> 00:27:12,005
What?

362
00:27:12,964 --> 00:27:15,258
Tomorrow’s the 15th...

363
00:27:16,343 --> 00:27:17,218
Oh...

364
00:27:27,228 --> 00:27:29,564
Kaede...

365
00:27:30,607 --> 00:27:34,027
Do you know why he's training so hard?

366
00:27:34,778 --> 00:27:35,779
No.

367
00:27:39,366 --> 00:27:43,078
He started boxing in high school, right?

368
00:27:44,954 --> 00:27:48,500
I remember, I didn’t want him getting beat up so much

369
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:52,212
I told him to keep up with soccer instead.

370
00:27:52,212 --> 00:27:57,467
Not that he listened. By then,
he already didn't talk to me much...

371
00:27:58,218 --> 00:28:01,971
I guess he preferred an independent sport like boxing.

372
00:28:01,971 --> 00:28:05,767
I never actually went to any of his matches.

373
00:28:06,685 --> 00:28:10,146
He barely comes home since he's gone off to college.

374
00:28:10,397 --> 00:28:13,483
I had no idea he was so passionate.

375
00:28:13,525 --> 00:28:17,529
I heard it's only recent he joined the club at his college.

376
00:28:18,863 --> 00:28:20,031
Is that right...?

377
00:28:20,573 --> 00:28:24,411
I guess I don't know anything about my own son.

378
00:28:25,078 --> 00:28:28,123
I don't know any of you.

379
00:28:29,999 --> 00:28:33,837
They made it so obvious to me yesterday on that show...
How pathetic...

380
00:28:35,255 --> 00:28:37,340
What a parent I am.

381
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:43,430
I can't blame Yuichi if he stopped caring...

382
00:28:51,896 --> 00:28:53,565
You can still play that?

383
00:28:53,898 --> 00:28:56,526
It's muscle memory.

384
00:28:57,152 --> 00:29:00,029
I remember I played this so much I began to hate it.

385
00:29:09,789 --> 00:29:11,750
I'm going out to the office.

386
00:29:12,333 --> 00:29:15,462
I thought you were taking time off?

387
00:29:15,503 --> 00:29:17,088
Circumstances have changed.

388
00:29:17,672 --> 00:29:21,551
Can't get the world to see the truth,
all we can do is show them.

389
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:24,262
The citizens should face their anger towards the politicians.

390
00:29:24,262 --> 00:29:27,599
I have to show them before the heat wears off--

391
00:29:28,308 --> 00:29:32,145
This is an international issue.

392
00:29:36,983 --> 00:29:41,321
Why don't you spend your time on
something more useful too?

393
00:30:02,008 --> 00:30:02,884
Yuichi!

394
00:30:05,428 --> 00:30:09,766
If you don't care so much why
don't you go back to your apartment?

395
00:30:09,766 --> 00:30:13,686
I bet you’re skipping classes at the university too.

396
00:30:15,313 --> 00:30:18,733
Don’t worry, I’ll be gone after tomorrow.

397
00:30:18,775 --> 00:30:21,694
That video... you are damn
irresponsible. You know that?

398
00:30:21,694 --> 00:30:24,405
Don't you understand your actions impact the family?

399
00:30:25,365 --> 00:30:27,408
Get your head out of your ass.

400
00:30:57,355 --> 00:30:58,356
We better get going.

401
00:31:03,611 --> 00:31:04,654
Ey yo!

402
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:10,994
Don’t act so tough, kid. You think this shit is easy?

403
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:15,164
A month ain't gonna do it.

404
00:31:15,164 --> 00:31:16,875
Don’t embarrass yourself.

405
00:31:16,916 --> 00:31:19,919
-And now, perfect mood music for a TGIF night

406
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:22,463
here you have DCas "I.D.K.W.W.G."--

407
00:31:22,547 --> 00:31:24,048
Poser!

408
00:31:24,757 --> 00:31:25,717
Yo, let's go.

409
00:31:35,643 --> 00:31:36,269
My bad.

410
00:31:36,686 --> 00:31:37,520
Excuse me...

411
00:31:37,979 --> 00:31:39,564
Shit, it's raining.

412
00:31:47,238 --> 00:31:49,866
It's 7 o'clock. Time for your evening news.

413
00:31:50,658 --> 00:31:54,412
After the alleged abduction of the 14-year-old boy,
Japan is on high alert.

414
00:31:54,412 --> 00:31:57,832
The United States maintains a neutral stance--

415
00:31:57,916 --> 00:31:59,334
What are you doing here?

416
00:31:59,334 --> 00:32:01,669
-to this particular foreign affairs issue--

417
00:32:01,711 --> 00:32:02,754
Long time no see.

418
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:06,466
-announced that they have no intentions of sending

419
00:32:06,466 --> 00:32:09,260
military support or taking any coercive action.

420
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:12,305
Foreign Minister Nakata of Japan commented as follows:

421
00:32:13,473 --> 00:32:17,894
"There is no proof this case of abduction is
a forcible political action taken against Japan.

422
00:32:17,894 --> 00:32:20,730
We agree the United States is not obligated to support--"

423
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:29,781
I made you dinner.

424
00:32:30,573 --> 00:32:32,575
Egg rolls, your favorite.

425
00:32:33,534 --> 00:32:34,285
Sorry...

426
00:32:34,786 --> 00:32:37,163
I can't really eat that stuff before my match.

427
00:32:39,999 --> 00:32:41,501
Oh... well shoot.

428
00:32:42,669 --> 00:32:43,962
Sorry.

429
00:32:44,963 --> 00:32:46,881
I should have done more research...

430
00:32:48,591 --> 00:32:49,342
So...

431
00:32:50,677 --> 00:32:52,345
what can you eat?

432
00:32:52,679 --> 00:32:56,349
If it's right before a match,
simple poultry or tomatoes are good...

433
00:32:56,599 --> 00:32:58,851
I should only drink water... and so on.

434
00:33:00,561 --> 00:33:04,190
It’s only a practice match...
can’t even eat normally?

435
00:33:04,816 --> 00:33:06,234
I mean I can

436
00:33:07,068 --> 00:33:10,279
but why should I half-ass it? You know.

437
00:33:16,828 --> 00:33:18,037
I saw the video...

438
00:33:19,038 --> 00:33:21,624
It was so strange. I used to see you every day

439
00:33:23,084 --> 00:33:28,339
and all of a sudden, the only place
I can find you is on the internet.

440
00:33:29,757 --> 00:33:31,801
Sorry I haven't been able to come home.

441
00:33:31,843 --> 00:33:33,219
It’s no problem, really.

442
00:33:34,137 --> 00:33:37,515
But why did you announce your match like that?

443
00:33:38,474 --> 00:33:40,893
Imagine all those people coming to harass you

444
00:33:40,893 --> 00:33:43,062
you won’t be able to concentrate.

445
00:33:43,521 --> 00:33:44,647
No one will show up.

446
00:33:44,814 --> 00:33:45,898
How do you know that?

447
00:33:47,066 --> 00:33:49,694
I know they won't, I mean...

448
00:34:00,955 --> 00:34:02,248
You'll see tomorrow.

449
00:34:02,749 --> 00:34:05,668
No one actually gives a damn about what my family does.

450
00:34:05,877 --> 00:34:09,881
They don't actually care "why" I'm boxing.

451
00:34:10,339 --> 00:34:13,176
They're just picking on whatever they can find.

452
00:34:13,259 --> 00:34:15,053
Irresponsible parents, false abduction

453
00:34:15,053 --> 00:34:17,180
the rumor became gossip.

454
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:21,142
Now every single bored person online is
pretending to be a detective.

455
00:34:21,184 --> 00:34:23,895
But why would you get into this now?

456
00:34:24,937 --> 00:34:26,230
It makes no sense.

457
00:34:26,856 --> 00:34:32,070
You told me you’re not that close to your family.

458
00:34:32,945 --> 00:34:35,156
But show a little care for your little brother.

459
00:34:35,156 --> 00:34:37,116
It'll improve your image.

460
00:34:37,158 --> 00:34:42,371
Who gives a fuck what society thinks of me?
I’m not the one who disappeared!

461
00:34:44,248 --> 00:34:45,583
...That's why I said...

462
00:34:48,503 --> 00:34:50,046
for Tetsuya...

463
00:34:59,138 --> 00:35:00,598
Do you remember 6 months ago

464
00:35:00,598 --> 00:35:02,809
when a 13-year-old boy was stabbed to death?

465
00:35:03,101 --> 00:35:04,894
We watched it on the news together.

466
00:35:04,894 --> 00:35:06,521
He was a good kid.

467
00:35:06,521 --> 00:35:09,774
Good grades, popular in school, also played soccer.
People loved him.

468
00:35:09,774 --> 00:35:13,027
People were shocked when they found him
dead by the river.

469
00:35:13,111 --> 00:35:16,322
It was even more shocking because the murderer was
a group of teenage delinquents.

470
00:35:16,364 --> 00:35:19,283
Under juvenile law their identities were kept private.

471
00:35:19,951 --> 00:35:22,703
But society didn't accept that.

472
00:35:23,037 --> 00:35:25,665
We saw the face of the boy that was killed.

473
00:35:27,208 --> 00:35:30,044
We saw his smile that made us
even more sad and angry about

474
00:35:30,044 --> 00:35:31,629
this brutal murder.

475
00:35:31,629 --> 00:35:33,172
People wanted retribution for him.

476
00:35:33,172 --> 00:35:35,091
So, someone found their identity

477
00:35:35,091 --> 00:35:36,968
they exposed the kids and their entire family

478
00:35:36,968 --> 00:35:38,803
all of their private information.

479
00:35:38,803 --> 00:35:40,555
and ruined them.

480
00:35:40,555 --> 00:35:42,390
It was such a big deal.

481
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:44,100
But that was all they did.

482
00:35:44,559 --> 00:35:46,727
Do you have any idea what I'm saying?

483
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:55,194
It was such a big deal until they figured out who they were.

484
00:35:55,194 --> 00:35:58,406
As soon as they knew, that's it!
We never heard of it again.

485
00:35:58,406 --> 00:36:00,241
It became irrelevant.

486
00:36:00,241 --> 00:36:03,077
What happened to justice? Wasn't it fucked up?

487
00:36:03,494 --> 00:36:04,954
No one actually gives a damn.

488
00:36:04,954 --> 00:36:07,123
The sorrow and the shock people feel about the news?

489
00:36:07,123 --> 00:36:08,958
They fade as life goes on.

490
00:36:08,958 --> 00:36:12,545
Teenagers stabbing a 13-year-old boy
to death becomes old news.

491
00:36:12,545 --> 00:36:16,924
And in their spare time, these people keep an eye out
for the next breaking news to talk about.

492
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:18,342
I mean of course.

493
00:36:18,342 --> 00:36:22,471
Who cares if someone was cut up into pieces?
Or if a terrorist bombed an entire city somewhere?

494
00:36:22,471 --> 00:36:24,891
It doesn't affect your life, or how society treats you.

495
00:36:24,891 --> 00:36:27,435
These issues exist in a different realm.

496
00:36:27,727 --> 00:36:32,773
It sucks, because the family
affected will probably never forget their pain.

497
00:36:32,773 --> 00:36:36,152
But we can. You can and I can too!

498
00:36:36,152 --> 00:36:39,697
They are left alone to wallow in their own sorrows.

499
00:36:40,573 --> 00:36:42,241
But… so who, then?

500
00:36:42,950 --> 00:36:45,828
Who will continue to sympathize, listen,
understand and care for these victims?

501
00:36:45,828 --> 00:36:47,079
What really saves them?!

502
00:36:47,079 --> 00:36:48,289
What?!

503
00:37:29,830 --> 00:37:32,458
Are you not coming home anymore?

504
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:34,126
I don't know.

505
00:37:36,963 --> 00:37:40,758
When will this end? How about school?!

506
00:37:41,884 --> 00:37:43,177
Hey...

507
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:34,103
I see...

508
00:38:36,731 --> 00:38:38,274
You’re a trooper.

509
00:38:42,486 --> 00:38:47,491
I’ll mail you the keys.

510
00:39:03,591 --> 00:39:05,092
...I have to go.

511
00:39:33,162 --> 00:39:35,122
What in the world were you thinking?

512
00:39:37,666 --> 00:39:39,877
How could you write something like that?!

513
00:39:40,628 --> 00:39:42,797
Do you have any idea what you have done?!

514
00:39:42,797 --> 00:39:44,632
All you are doing is breeding hate!

515
00:39:44,673 --> 00:39:46,175
Oh, for Christ's sake.

516
00:39:46,175 --> 00:39:50,054
Don't you see that I can make a real impact
in this country right now?

517
00:39:50,054 --> 00:39:52,932
Will we get Tetsuya back if we swallow our words?

518
00:39:52,932 --> 00:39:56,936
It's time to stand up and make a change
once and for all!

519
00:39:57,478 --> 00:39:59,647
Why do you only think of yourself?

520
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:02,274
Is your career more important than your family?

521
00:40:02,316 --> 00:40:05,319
Why can't you see I'm not just doing this for my job.

522
00:40:05,319 --> 00:40:06,779
I'm doing this for Tetsuya!

523
00:40:07,071 --> 00:40:09,532
Please stop...

524
00:40:10,116 --> 00:40:12,785
What a load of crap.

525
00:40:14,495 --> 00:40:16,997
You're just using him as an excuse.

526
00:40:17,039 --> 00:40:20,292
Now hold on...
You always wanted to "make an impact."

527
00:40:20,668 --> 00:40:23,045
You haven't had an opportunity like this in years.

528
00:40:23,963 --> 00:40:27,591
Ever since getting laid off from your old publisher

529
00:40:27,591 --> 00:40:30,553
you've been stuck at the crappy B-rated agency...

530
00:40:30,594 --> 00:40:33,389
Piss off. That's got nothing to do with it!

531
00:40:33,389 --> 00:40:36,725
I am using my resources to produce the best
possible outcome from this situation!

532
00:40:37,268 --> 00:40:40,312
You think your provocations help us?!

533
00:40:40,646 --> 00:40:42,690
You're just putting your family in danger.

534
00:40:42,857 --> 00:40:44,692
They might come after you next.

535
00:40:44,692 --> 00:40:45,901
What will you do then?!

536
00:40:45,943 --> 00:40:47,361
What's the point of playing "nice?"

537
00:40:47,361 --> 00:40:49,488
You think that'll bring Tetsuya back?

538
00:40:49,697 --> 00:40:51,699
You think apologizing to the world will help any of us?!

539
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:53,451
Please stop yelling

540
00:40:54,285 --> 00:40:55,536
both of you...

541
00:40:57,872 --> 00:40:59,290
And how about you?

542
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:00,833
What have you done?

543
00:41:01,542 --> 00:41:03,836
What have you done for your little brother, huh?

544
00:41:04,628 --> 00:41:06,797
You knew your mother and I were busy with work.

545
00:41:07,965 --> 00:41:10,885
Tetsuya was your responsibility to look after.

546
00:41:12,178 --> 00:41:16,265
You were barely home even in high school.

547
00:41:19,268 --> 00:41:21,103
I'm not saying it's your fault.

548
00:41:21,228 --> 00:41:23,981
But what have you done for him since?!

549
00:41:25,483 --> 00:41:27,485
You're not a fucking child!

550
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:37,620
Well isn't that convenient.

551
00:41:38,913 --> 00:41:40,915
Now you're the victim because I'm yelling.

552
00:41:42,041 --> 00:41:43,584
You are a monster!

553
00:41:43,959 --> 00:41:46,921
Those vultures aren't wrong.

554
00:41:48,839 --> 00:41:51,008
You are a user. You're just using Tetsuya!

555
00:41:51,050 --> 00:41:52,885
How dare you! Learn your place!

556
00:41:53,385 --> 00:41:56,388
I should’ve divorced you when I had the chance!

557
00:41:56,514 --> 00:41:58,098
Tetsuya wouldn’t have been born!

558
00:41:58,098 --> 00:41:59,725
None of this would have happened!

559
00:42:05,397 --> 00:42:07,483
Don’t come near me! Don’t touch me.

560
00:42:08,442 --> 00:42:09,735
Get away…

561
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:23,332
GET OUT.

562
00:42:50,401 --> 00:42:51,443
Sweetheart...

563
00:43:00,327 --> 00:43:01,829
Hey... sorry.

564
00:43:05,541 --> 00:43:08,877
Wanna go out tonight? Are you free?

565
00:43:10,379 --> 00:43:12,131
I know it’s late. Sorry. I just...

566
00:43:12,881 --> 00:43:14,091
Please

567
00:43:14,633 --> 00:43:16,844
can we do something fun?

568
00:43:46,582 --> 00:43:48,083
Poor baby...

569
00:43:50,002 --> 00:43:53,672
you’re probably cold... frightened...

570
00:43:54,590 --> 00:43:56,300
I’m so sorry...

571
00:43:59,803 --> 00:44:01,764
If you weren’t born

572
00:44:02,723 --> 00:44:05,225
none of this would have happened...

573
00:44:20,699 --> 00:44:21,867
Tomorrow.

574
00:44:23,619 --> 00:44:24,161
What?

575
00:44:24,745 --> 00:44:27,039
Come tomorrow.

576
00:44:27,581 --> 00:44:28,666
Please.

577
00:44:30,626 --> 00:44:33,837
I’m sorry sweetheart

578
00:44:35,214 --> 00:44:38,884
I don’t think we can come tomorrow.

579
00:44:40,678 --> 00:44:41,553
I'm sorry...

580
00:44:41,595 --> 00:44:44,723
Please be there. All three of you.

581
00:45:35,816 --> 00:45:37,693
Why did you turn the light out?!

582
00:45:37,735 --> 00:45:39,027
Come here Kaede.

583
00:45:40,362 --> 00:45:41,739
Look at that.

584
00:45:42,322 --> 00:45:44,658
It's so cinematic.

585
00:45:44,658 --> 00:45:47,077
I don't know if this is what Kaede wants to see.

586
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:50,831
-announces the two fighters to the ring.

587
00:45:50,873 --> 00:45:52,291
This is scary.

588
00:45:53,333 --> 00:45:54,918
No it's not, it's exciting...

589
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:57,713
-altogether his 7th world title match.

590
00:45:58,589 --> 00:46:00,883
His weight is 61.2 kilograms--

591
00:47:01,610 --> 00:47:04,154
-Admitting that the rumors are...
-Have no idea. I'm an only child...

592
00:47:04,196 --> 00:47:06,782
-What are you doing?! Stay away...
-Your actions impact the family...

593
00:47:06,824 --> 00:47:08,659
-Why were you separated for 16 years...
-Get your head out of your ass...

594
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:09,952
That's why I said...

595
00:47:09,952 --> 00:47:10,828
for Tetsuya.

596
00:47:38,856 --> 00:47:39,773
Sorry...

597
00:47:45,821 --> 00:47:46,572
Wait!

598
00:47:47,865 --> 00:47:51,451
I think... I think I know what you’re trying to do.

599
00:47:53,537 --> 00:47:54,788
We'll be there!

600
00:47:55,622 --> 00:47:56,748
All three of us

601
00:47:57,958 --> 00:47:58,959
together.

602
00:48:26,945 --> 00:48:28,906
Alright, it’s about that time.

603
00:48:33,076 --> 00:48:35,746
Phew, check that confidence.

604
00:48:37,956 --> 00:48:41,668
Well, he was the champion in his high school class.

605
00:48:42,586 --> 00:48:44,254
Truth be told brother

606
00:48:44,922 --> 00:48:47,799
you and him are like mountain and hill.

607
00:48:50,469 --> 00:48:54,222
But listen, he hasn’t trained against you. You know?

608
00:48:57,726 --> 00:48:59,937
’Scuse me, you're on standby.

609
00:49:01,063 --> 00:49:01,897
And?

610
00:49:04,650 --> 00:49:06,193
It's your turn... sir.

611
00:49:07,235 --> 00:49:08,528
Please go on up.

612
00:49:30,133 --> 00:49:32,219
Damn, I lost that one.

613
00:49:48,527 --> 00:49:51,321
It’s only 3 rounds. Don’t let the air press you.

614
00:49:51,655 --> 00:49:52,864
You got this

615
00:49:53,198 --> 00:49:55,784
remember high school?

616
00:50:04,835 --> 00:50:05,794
What?

617
00:50:07,212 --> 00:50:09,131
So apparently, he's famous or something

618
00:50:09,673 --> 00:50:11,967
but doesn't he look like a sissy?

619
00:50:12,843 --> 00:50:14,428
You should just give it to him good.

620
00:50:14,553 --> 00:50:16,179
Fighters in the middle.

621
00:50:17,097 --> 00:50:19,599
This is an unofficial match, the result...

622
00:50:21,977 --> 00:50:23,603
You famous or something?

623
00:50:24,396 --> 00:50:25,605
Ready to be ruined?

624
00:50:25,647 --> 00:50:27,149
Focus on the match.

625
00:50:27,482 --> 00:50:29,484
Make it a fair game.

626
00:50:29,943 --> 00:50:31,194
Touch gloves.

627
00:50:35,323 --> 00:50:36,116
Corner.

628
00:50:39,161 --> 00:50:40,495
Second, out.

629
00:50:42,164 --> 00:50:43,331
Round one.

630
00:50:59,139 --> 00:51:02,184
Jab him! Right... jab!

631
00:51:02,225 --> 00:51:03,393
Get the body...

632
00:51:04,102 --> 00:51:05,228
Get the body! I said...

633
00:51:05,395 --> 00:51:06,354
Yuichi?!

634
00:51:16,907 --> 00:51:17,699
Corner.

635
00:51:28,543 --> 00:51:30,212
He's weak already.

636
00:51:30,712 --> 00:51:32,631
You got him on the next round.

637
00:51:33,590 --> 00:51:35,592
You keep this up, you'll lose in a unanimous decision.

638
00:51:35,592 --> 00:51:37,052
You've got to attack.

639
00:51:37,094 --> 00:51:39,221
He's not tired yet.

640
00:51:48,897 --> 00:51:49,856
Never mind, drink.

641
00:51:49,898 --> 00:51:51,691
Second, out.

642
00:51:55,821 --> 00:51:57,322
Yuichi, attack! Get him!

643
00:51:59,574 --> 00:52:00,617
Round two.

644
00:52:14,798 --> 00:52:16,216
Break it up.

645
00:52:17,717 --> 00:52:18,468
Break.

646
00:52:19,219 --> 00:52:19,845
Get up.

647
00:52:20,512 --> 00:52:21,221
You alright?

648
00:52:21,263 --> 00:52:22,305
I'm good.

649
00:52:22,764 --> 00:52:23,306
Alright?

650
00:52:24,432 --> 00:52:25,433
Ready, fight.

651
00:52:30,522 --> 00:52:33,024
Break!

652
00:52:37,195 --> 00:52:38,071
Ready, fight.

653
00:52:45,245 --> 00:52:47,289
Break. I said break!

654
00:52:49,124 --> 00:52:51,084
That was a deliberate clinch. That's a warning.

655
00:52:51,209 --> 00:52:52,627
Next time is a strike.

656
00:52:52,794 --> 00:52:54,629
Dude, are you listening?!

657
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:56,089
Yuichi!

658
00:53:00,051 --> 00:53:01,720
Down! Neutral corner.

659
00:53:10,395 --> 00:53:11,396
Take your stance.

660
00:53:11,396 --> 00:53:12,230
Ready?

661
00:53:14,232 --> 00:53:15,025
Fight!

662
00:53:16,026 --> 00:53:17,777
Back to your corners.

663
00:53:26,912 --> 00:53:28,580
KO Yuichi! KO.

664
00:53:28,663 --> 00:53:29,789
That's all you got left bro!

665
00:53:29,789 --> 00:53:30,916
Are you LISTENING?

666
00:53:30,957 --> 00:53:32,792
Is he okay?

667
00:53:33,585 --> 00:53:34,711
Can you see?

668
00:53:35,420 --> 00:53:36,671
He got it, he got it.

669
00:53:36,713 --> 00:53:37,756
You sure?

670
00:53:37,923 --> 00:53:39,216
Thank you, he's fine.

671
00:53:40,050 --> 00:53:40,884
Alright.

672
00:53:44,721 --> 00:53:47,182
Yuichi, listen to me. You got this.

673
00:53:47,766 --> 00:53:49,309
You good? You got it?

674
00:53:50,727 --> 00:53:52,479
It's the last round. You got this.

675
00:53:52,771 --> 00:53:54,397
Second out, second out!

676
00:53:54,648 --> 00:53:56,066
Give us a second. Give us...

677
00:53:56,066 --> 00:53:57,609
I said give us a second!

678
00:54:25,011 --> 00:54:25,929
Third Round.

679
00:54:38,316 --> 00:54:40,235
Down! Neutral Corner.

680
00:54:49,160 --> 00:54:50,412
Ready, fight.

681
00:55:02,507 --> 00:55:04,801
Yuichi wasn't isolating himself from us.

682
00:55:05,510 --> 00:55:07,012
It wasn't that he didn't care.

683
00:55:08,305 --> 00:55:11,808
He knew he wouldn't be ready in time to win this match.

684
00:55:12,225 --> 00:55:15,270
He knew everyone else would be against him.

685
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:19,274
He saw through it all, and even then

686
00:55:21,359 --> 00:55:24,612
he took action the way he believed would

687
00:55:24,779 --> 00:55:26,364
show us

688
00:55:26,698 --> 00:55:28,283
and us only.

689
00:55:36,916 --> 00:55:41,463
We only have each other.

690
00:55:42,047 --> 00:55:43,340
This is scary.

691
00:55:44,257 --> 00:55:46,468
It's not, it's exciting.

692
00:55:47,969 --> 00:55:50,221
Yuichi, come join us.

693
00:55:52,223 --> 00:55:55,518
-It's his first World Title Match. If he wins, he would be

694
00:55:55,518 --> 00:55:58,813
the oldest Japanese champion in history.

695
00:55:59,230 --> 00:56:02,359
The referee is Katsumata Takaaki.

696
00:56:03,026 --> 00:56:04,569
The crowd cheers--

697
00:56:04,569 --> 00:56:07,238
-the one in black is the challenger. Blue is Sasai--

698
00:56:07,238 --> 00:56:08,823
-That's his lucky color--
