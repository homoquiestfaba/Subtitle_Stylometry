1
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:44,842
Bradley, tell me how old you are, please.

2
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:46,251
28 years old.

3
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,402
- What do you do for a living?
- In-home sales.

4
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:51,810
Okay. And Lisa, what about you?

5
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:53,405
I'm 28. I'm a teacher.

6
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:56,563
Okay. Teacher.

7
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,688
And how long have you guys been married?

8
00:00:58,760 --> 00:00:59,761
10 years.

9
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:02,770
Okay. At least we're in agreement about that.

10
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:05,884
Do you have any children?

11
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,047
No.

12
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:08,246
No children.

13
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,090
Do you want children?

14
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:13,961
I do.

15
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:15,764
Okay.

16
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:17,806
Bradley?

17
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,411
I just think we need to be in a better place

18
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:20,845
before we bring somebody else into it.

19
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:22,127
Okay.

20
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:24,649
Do you wanna say something, Lisa?

21
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:28,089
I love him. It's just that I think
people change. Don't you agree?

22
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:29,691
Yeah. They do.

23
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:33,362
I often feel like we become
a lot of different people

24
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:36,011
before we actually settle into who we are.

25
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:37,923
Especially when we're young.

26
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,570
We were 18.

27
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:42,530
I'm not the same little girl
that was in love with him in high school.

28
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,125
But I still love you.

29
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:49,441
Tell me what you want me to do.
I promise I can change.

30
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:50,967
Tell me, please.

31
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,201
Just don't do that.

32
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,322
I can't do this.

33
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,041
I'm sorry.

34
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:58,443
Bradley, don't. I'm sorry.

35
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:05,206
I don't wanna hurt him. He deserves better.

36
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:07,325
Better than you?

37
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:10,526
Yeah.

38
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,650
Why do you feel that way?

39
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:15,526
He's a good guy.

40
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,968
He's consistent and loving.

41
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:22,769
But I feel like we're roommates
and not husband and wife.

42
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,440
You met someone?

43
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,046
And he's showing you
everything you've been missing.

44
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:35,606
This new guy, he excites you.

45
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:41,805
He buys you flowers
and he tells you that you're beautiful.

46
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:45,047
He says all the things that Brad doesn't.

47
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:51,404
It doesn't matter to me.
I'm not here to judge you.

48
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,648
I just think, if you're honest with me,

49
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:56,166
then we can get to the root
of the real issues.

50
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,888
I'd like to tell you a story.

51
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:06,368
About my sister. If that's okay.

52
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:14,287
Judith. That was her name.

53
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:20,050
I knew her so well. We were so close.

54
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:24,411
<i>We were raised in a very small town.</i>

55
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,282
<i>And our mother, Sarah,</i>

56
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:30,040
<i>she took us to church five days a week.</i>

57
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,924
<i>And twice on Sundays.</i>

58
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,567
<i>There wasn't a lotta time for fun.</i>

59
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:38,203
<i>And boys? Forget about it.</i>

60
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,601
<i>From the moment Judith and Brice met,</i>

61
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:44,280
<i>something sparked between them.</i>

62
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,762
<i>They became inseparable.</i>

63
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,802
<i>They were the yin and yang to each other.</i>

64
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,124
<i>Now, Sarah tried to keep
a strict hand on Judith,</i>

65
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:04,569
<i>but Judith was in love.</i>

66
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,650
<i>And so was Brice.</i>

67
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,444
Yes, she's asleep. I promise.

68
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,761
Let's go. Come on.

69
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:15,961
Stop.

70
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:19,201
<i>You see, love, for Judith,</i>

71
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:21,482
<i>seemed to be different from other people.</i>

72
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:24,606
<i>For her, it was all-consuming.</i>

73
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:27,208
<i>It was breath to life.</i>

74
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:49,521
<i>Most times, they didn't even notice
that Sarah was watching them.</i>

75
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:54,411
Gonna see you tomorrow.

76
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:59,362
<i>Somewhere along the way,
she decided she couldn't fight this.</i>

77
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,004
<i>Maybe this was meant to be.</i>

78
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,802
<i>Or in her own words,
"Maybe it was God's will."</i>

79
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:10,207
<i>Judith was so worried
when Brice asked for her hand in marriage.</i>

80
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:14,046
<i>She just knew her mother would say, "No."
But she reluctantly said...</i>

81
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,361
Yes.

82
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:27,091
<i>I'll tell ya, if smiles were dollars,</i>

83
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,369
<i>they would have had millions.</i>

84
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:31,961
Bye!

85
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:35,041
<i>At last, they were together.</i>

86
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,682
<i>And life began.</i>

87
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,562
<i>They found this cute little place together.</i>

88
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,041
I won! No, I won!

89
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:58,289
<i>They didn't have much,
but they had each other.</i>

90
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:00,443
So slow. Come on! What you waiting for?

91
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:03,047
<i>And they were more in love than ever.</i>

92
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:07,646
<i>Brice's lifelong dream
was to work in a small pharmacy</i>

93
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:09,091
<i>that maybe one day he could own.</i>

94
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,250
<i>And Judith, well,</i>

95
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,966
<i>her dream was to become
a marriage counselor.</i>

96
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,611
<i>But that wasn't easy.</i>

97
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:20,883
<i>So in the meantime,
she found work with Janice Wise,</i>

98
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:23,082
<i>the millionaire matchmaker.</i>

99
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:26,087
- Good morning.
- Bonjour.

100
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,645
Good morning.

101
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,609
Your 8:00 a.m. is on his way up.

102
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,205
- He's early.
- Yeah.

103
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,281
Okay. <i>Merci.</i>

104
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:34,482
Here you go. Yeah.

105
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,884
Look at those shoes.

106
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,241
Yeah? I didn't notice. Thank you.

107
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,924
I wasn't talking about hers,
I was talking about yours.

108
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,124
They look like orthopedic shoes.

109
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:49,448
Judith, we've been
going over this for weeks.

110
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:51,842
Look around this office. What do you see?

111
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,321
A bunch of women with hair from India?

112
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,970
Look at me, Judith.

113
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:03,806
What you should see is people in this office
care about what they look like.

114
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,365
Unlike you.

115
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,170
We have over a billion dollars

116
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:09,641
walking in and out of these offices
looking for love.

117
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:12,644
We have a standard to uphold.
This is not our standard.

118
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,564
Okay, Ava,

119
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:18,247
I don't have to wear fancy dresses
or fancy shoes

120
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:20,482
to prove that I'm qualified to do my job.

121
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:22,125
Yes, you do.

122
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:24,482
- No, I don't. I have a degree.
- Yeah, you do.

123
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:26,210
- A degree?
- Yes.

124
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:29,171
A degree on the wall
without labels on your back is nothing.

125
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:32,483
Where are you from, new girl?

126
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,801
Belvedere.

127
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:35,725
Where the hell is that?

128
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,167
In the South.

129
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:39,800
The South. That explains it.

130
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:41,848
You grew up below the Mason-Dixon.

131
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,844
Okay, Ava, you really should take a Valium.

132
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:47,486
You really need an iron to that skirt.

133
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:48,681
What?

134
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:49,886
I did.

135
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:54,927
Say no more. That blouse. It's telling it all.

136
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,610
So does your dress.

137
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,525
What's wrong with my dress?

138
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:02,362
Can you even breathe, Ava?

139
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,761
You don't breathe in Herve.

140
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,444
Follow me, Mr. Madison,
Janice is waiting for you.

141
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,530
Oh, my God.

142
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,201
Who's that?

143
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,164
You're killing me.
You don't know who that is?

144
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,526
No.

145
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:21,685
The third largest social media
inventor since Zuckerberg?

146
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:24,202
Class-Meet? What planet are you from?

147
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:26,090
What is he doing here?

148
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:29,051
Please, don't tell me he's here
to get fixed up by The Madam.

149
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:31,891
She is no madam.
You need to bite your tongue.

150
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,606
She's a matchmaker
and she's very good at her job.

151
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,410
Yeah. So are pimps.

152
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,644
Come. Please.

153
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,325
Stay right there.
I know she was talking to me.

154
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:43,561
Whatever.

155
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,441
Here we go.

156
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,201
Yes?

157
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:53,291
Ava, this handsome young man
is looking to find a lot of answers

158
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,283
as to how we do things around here.

159
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,441
Take notes, please.

160
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,886
Are you looking for a date?

161
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:03,724
I'm sure this handsome face
has no problem getting dates.

162
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:04,961
Well,

163
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,444
I'm actually in between
relationships right now.

164
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:09,961
So you could use our services?

165
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:13,251
Well, I prefer the old-fashioned way
of meeting women.

166
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:15,849
You like to pay?

167
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:18,366
No, that's not what I meant.

168
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:23,050
What exactly do you do?

169
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,281
Me?

170
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:28,807
Yes.

171
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,009
I'm the in-house therapist.

172
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:33,641
This is Judith.

173
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,566
Judith.

174
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:40,204
Well, Judith,
you are who I'd like to speak to.

175
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:43,124
Judith, Harley is looking
to invest in my company.

176
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:47,481
We want to take Wise Counsel
online and international.

177
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:49,645
Okay.

178
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,643
Well, before I make that type of investment,

179
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:54,644
I like to be quite certain
of what I'm getting myself into.

180
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:57,287
I totally understand.

181
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:00,848
And Judith will take great care of you.

182
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:04,442
Ava, clear Judith's schedule.

183
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:08,809
Judith, please, answer any questions
Mr. Madison may have.

184
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:12,201
Sure. Come right this way.

185
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:13,327
All right.

186
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,487
Bye. Nice to meet you.

187
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,884
So you gonna start today?

188
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:24,967
I think so. Thank you so much.

189
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:28,123
Don't thank me yet.
Did you show her what she's gonna do?

190
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,324
Yes, ma'am. She'll be working the register
and stocking the shelves.

191
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:35,445
I check the register at random every day,

192
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:38,251
so you're gonna have to
account for every dime.

193
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,884
- No problem.
- Random!

194
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:42,207
I got it.

195
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:45,324
Brice tells me you're from Boston?

196
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,206
Yeah.

197
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:52,929
You don't sound like you come from Boston.

198
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,361
Do you know Boston?

199
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,731
No. I've never been there. Yet.

200
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,330
What part of Boston?

201
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,046
Roxbury.

202
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:13,880
Are you married?

203
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,331
No. I'm not married.

204
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:17,526
Do you have kids?

205
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,167
No.

206
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,930
So should I get to work?

207
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:32,522
Yeah, there's a box of deodorant
under the counter

208
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,648
that needs to be restocked.
You can start there.

209
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:35,721
Okay.

210
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:38,687
Nice meeting you. Thank you.

211
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,081
Hey-

212
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:46,961
No husband?
And that blouse she's wearing?

213
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,281
And those boots?

214
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,244
She's a lesbian.

215
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:57,931
Does it matter?

216
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:02,641
No. I don't think people will think
there's anything between us,

217
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:05,166
but you never know. People talk.

218
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,287
Yeah.

219
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:13,602
Matchmaking. I don't know
how I feel about all this.

220
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,601
I'm sorry?

221
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:17,963
Well, it's a dating service for the rich.

222
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:22,245
I just... I'm not sure this is something
I should be investing in.

223
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:25,125
You know, it's kinda strange.

224
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,281
Yeah.

225
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:29,402
So you agree with that?

226
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:30,880
A little bit. Yeah.

227
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:37,971
So I shouldn't invest?

228
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:40,320
I'm not saying that.

229
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,484
I would never say that.

230
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,802
Like you said, it's a little strange.

231
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,969
A little odd. Little unnatural.

232
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:51,649
Bunch of old guys paying to meet women.

233
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:55,005
I'm gonna shut up. I'm saying too much.

234
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:57,647
No, no, honestly, continue, please.

235
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:00,565
I kind of prefer the old-fashioned way
of finding love, but...

236
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:03,291
Well, I completely agree. I do.

237
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:05,687
But, let me play devil's advocate.

238
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:09,682
So, more than half of all new relationships
are started online in this day and age.

239
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,400
- Yeah.
- Right.

240
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:15,280
So it's obvious, she definitely...
She has something going here.

241
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,840
I'm just not sure exactly how I fit into it.

242
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,527
That's why I'm here.
To help you figure that out.

243
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:24,889
I think we can start with the Wise Counsel
questionnaire that I developed.

244
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:29,887
And pretty much we use it to see
whether or not someones compatible.

245
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:35,201
Do I know you from somewhere?

246
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:38,041
I doubt we run in the same circles.

247
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:39,687
Do you run?

248
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:41,041
Yeah, every day at...

249
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:43,680
Landover Park. I knew it.

250
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:45,521
You run there?

251
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:48,849
8:00 a.m. every Saturday.
Start at the wheelhouse...

252
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:51,691
I think I have seen you run past me before.

253
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:54,724
You're that cheesy guy always running
with his shirt off and making grunts.

254
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:55,961
- I'm not cheesy.
- Yeah, you are.

255
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:57,041
I get hot.

256
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:58,889
No, you're running with your shirt off

257
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,690
so all the pretty girls could notice you.

258
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,245
Well, you noticed me, right?

259
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:11,721
Turn to page two.

260
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:14,360
You'll see the compatibility questionnaire.

261
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:15,647
All business.

262
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:16,846
I wanted to start with that.

263
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:17,961
I like that.

264
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:26,087
Hey, you.

265
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:28,763
How was your third week? Any better?

266
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:31,886
Oh, God.

267
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,405
<i>That bad, huh'?</i>

268
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:40,771
Honey, what am I doing there?

269
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:42,410
I have a master's degree.

270
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:47,083
Why am I wasting my time in some snobby
office helping old men get a date?

271
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:51,928
Is that what I busted my butt in college
and graduated early for?

272
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,491
Like, it don't make sense.

273
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:55,290
Babe, it'll get there.

274
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:59,003
But, baby, I really feel like I'm getting stuck.

275
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:01,128
You know what I had to do today?

276
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:07,162
I just spent three hours with some cheesy
computer guy named Harley something.

277
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,805
The Class-Meet guy?

278
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:10,805
Was he looking for a date?

279
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:14,608
No. Does everyone know
about this guy except for me?

280
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,450
Baby, you should. He's loaded.

281
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:19,286
Wow. You sound like Ava.

282
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:23,081
Man. I have to get outta there
and start my own practice.

283
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:25,165
Babe, that's a long ways off.

284
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:29,040
I figure in about 10 to 15 years

285
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:31,009
we'll be established enough
to take that chance.

286
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:33,328
But right now you don't need
to be thinking about that.

287
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:35,291
10 to 15 years?

288
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:39,690
Great, that's encouraging. Thanks, baby.

289
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:43,169
And my mother called me today.

290
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:47,046
And she's coming into town
for some revival or something.

291
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,123
Which is just what I need.

292
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:52,331
The stress of this job
and the judgment of my mother.

293
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:55,046
You know she's gonna be
bothering me about you, asking me,

294
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,691
"Judith Ann, have you been
doing your wifely duties?"

295
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:59,882
Yes, Mother, I have been cooking for him,

296
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:00,961
I have been cleaning,

297
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,929
and I have been having sex with him
three times a week,

298
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,331
just like it says in the Bible.

299
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:06,490
It says three times a week, baby?

300
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:08,170
Then you've been slacking.

301
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:10,603
Shut up. I'm kidding.

302
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:12,364
I'm not. And...

303
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:16,691
You know that little thing you do
on birthdays and holidays?

304
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:19,571
I wonder what your mother
would say about that.

305
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:21,449
My mother doesn't know
about that little trick

306
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:23,090
I give you on birthdays and holidays.

307
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:25,731
And if she did, you wouldn't get it anymore.

308
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:31,121
I'm gonna get up.
I'm gonna go make you some dinner.

309
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:33,567
No. You know what I'm gonna do for you?

310
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:35,126
I'm gonna take you out to dinner.

311
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:37,601
That $1.99 buffet again, baby?

312
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:39,769
Made my stomach hurt.

313
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:42,851
No, I'm gonna take you
somewhere nice and fancy.

314
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,527
- Really?
- Yeah, come on, let's go.

315
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:50,206
Okay, I'm gonna go put my shoes back on.

316
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:54,645
I'm gonna take you to the $5.99 buffet.

317
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,404
All right, you!

318
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,361
All right.

319
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,450
- I did.
- Good.

320
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:04,727
And maybe next time we go,
the lady next to us...

321
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:07,167
I was watching
and she had the artichoke dip.

322
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:08,480
- I wanna order that next time.
- I saw it.

323
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:09,766
- It did look good.
- With the chips.

324
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:11,484
With the different color chips.
That looked so good.

325
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:12,641
- Now that.
- With the enchiladas, too.

326
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:14,569
That's a fine ass bitch right there.

327
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:16,724
- Was he talking to me?
- Babe, keep walking.

328
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,370
I know you ain't talkin' to me.

329
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:21,011
- Show some respect. Kick your ass to hell.
- Baby, come on!

330
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:23,845
- You know what? You need to be in church!
- Damn it, get in the car, Judith!

331
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:25,445
Pick up the Bible
since you ain't got no good tact!

332
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,124
- Judith, get in the car.
- Your mama shoulda taught...

333
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:30,566
Why would you let these
assholes ruin our night?

334
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:33,371
Ain't got no kind of manners.
What the hell they talkin' to me like that for?

335
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:34,851
This is crazy.

336
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:36,843
Thinking I'm just some
regular bitch on the street.

337
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:38,251
Enough, Judith.

338
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,448
- Think they can talk to me like that?
- Enough! Let it go.

339
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:41,641
I showed 'em!

340
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:42,966
Just let it go. it doesn't matter.

341
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:44,127
Their mama shoulda taught them better.

342
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,163
She shoulda had them in school.

343
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:47,691
- Judith. Judith!
- Not hanging on the street.

344
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:48,886
Common whore!

345
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,564
- You stupid joker!
- Judith!

346
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:30,646
Baby, you been really quiet since dinner.
Did I miss something?

347
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,324
You didn't hear that guy?

348
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,483
Babe, I knew that was it.

349
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,809
Yes, I heard him.

350
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:45,967
Some things you just gotta ignore.

351
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:53,162
Why can't I ignore the fact
that I didn't feel safe?

352
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:58,360
Babe, those guys coulda had guns.

353
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,690
We did the right thing.

354
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,522
I just don't like the way I feel.

355
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:17,251
Baby, I will always protect you.

356
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:20,364
I'd die for you.

357
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:30,929
I just wanna go to sleep.

358
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,561
I'm sorry.

359
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:03,361
I'm with you. If you say "go," I go.

360
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,451
You! Stop it.

361
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:08,921
- No, I'm being serious.
- You are the worst.

362
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:10,690
No, come on.

363
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:15,802
Judith, Harley and I have been going over
the questionnaire you came up with

364
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:18,008
and he has some questions for you.

365
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:22,522
You will be putting in some late hours
trying to help him.

366
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:24,364
You don't mind, do you, mon cheri?

367
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:25,761
All right.

368
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:27,251
I will be in my office, darling.

369
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:29,482
Okay. Okay.

370
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,487
Okay.

371
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:35,800
So you have some questions?

372
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:37,001
Yes. Yes.

373
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:39,527
Now, this is actually really good.

374
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,440
Thank you.

375
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,249
I need to formulate a program
that's gonna tell me

376
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:45,448
what kinda person we're dealing with
just based on your questions.

377
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,684
That's a program I'd like to see.

378
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:49,370
Well, good, because I need you
to help me build it.

379
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:51,524
I'm not a programmer.

380
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:55,091
Well, that's fine.
I just need your expertise on humans.

381
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:57,083
All of these questions here.

382
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:59,811
Now, they tell you a little something
about the prospective client, right?

383
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:02,687
Yes. As well as the people they will attract.

384
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:03,761
Okay, great.

385
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:06,770
What I don't understand is
why are there so many questions here

386
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:09,320
about past relationships.

387
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:13,602
Because you learn a lot about someone
from their prior relationships.

388
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:15,609
You learn patterns. You learn behaviors.

389
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:17,409
You learn whether or not
they play the victim role.

390
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:20,963
Do they take full responsibility
for their role in the breakup?

391
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:24,326
All that from one little sheet of paper?

392
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:25,927
Yes.

393
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:30,161
"Hmm" what?

394
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:34,880
I've never wanted to know
the past of any woman I was ever dating.

395
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,170
Maybe that's why you're single.

396
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:40,641
Okay.

397
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:48,880
Last night, I went ahead
and filled out one of these.

398
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:51,407
Maybe you can tell me
a little something about myself.

399
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:54,928
Why would you fill this out?
You're not trying to find a date.

400
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:57,529
I'd like to see how good you are.

401
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,086
Okay.

402
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:06,160
Well, you are relationship-oriented.

403
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:07,965
You give a lot in relationships.

404
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,802
You believe in love,

405
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:16,403
but because you've been hurt a few times,
you've given up on it.

406
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:17,965
You are passionate.

407
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:22,884
You look like you got
a little bit of a mean streak, though.

408
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:26,531
Very attentive. Need a lot of reassurance.

409
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:28,125
Very observant.

410
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:38,524
Not bad. Not bad.

411
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:40,721
So let's continue.

412
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:44,289
Page two is really interesting.

413
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:47,281
You need a ride?

414
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:48,646
No, I'm good.

415
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,770
Can you pass me my purse
underneath there?

416
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:52,406
Yeah.

417
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:55,607
Thank you, guys. Good night.

418
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:57,091
Good night.

419
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:04,322
Something's wrong with the girl.

420
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:06,931
What do you mean?

421
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,129
Did you see the way
she covered herself up as she's leaving?

422
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:18,441
It's chilly.

423
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:21,364
No, something's wrong with the girl.

424
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:26,010
What, you don't think
we made the right decision?

425
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:27,445
I need the help.

426
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:31,607
But she has to be watched.

427
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,610
Why don't you just take the whole bucket?

428
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:43,047
I don't want the whole bucket.

429
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:49,486
<i>Yes! Yes, yes, yes.
Judith, you nailed another one.</i>

430
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:51,130
<i>I did, didn't I?</i>

431
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:53,084
<i>All right, come on, let's wrap this up.
I gotta get home.</i>

432
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:54,161
<i>Okay-</i>

433
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:56,447
50-50 chance that couple's gonna work.

434
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:58,682
-50-50?
- Yeah.

435
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,928
Training this computer to think like you.

436
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:03,964
50-50. 50-50. Let's go.

437
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,006
Come on.

438
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:12,131
50-50.

439
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:14,801
Can I get some? Wow.

440
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:16,441
Okay.

441
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:17,726
I'm impressed. I'm thoroughly impressed.

442
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:18,961
My husband's never gonna believe

443
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:20,166
that I'm helping out with stuff like this.

444
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:22,561
You were amazing.
How long you guys been married?

445
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:25,405
Six years. I've known him for 19.

446
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:27,241
19 years?

447
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:31,487
Wait, so you're a very old-looking
young woman

448
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:34,040
or you met him when you were five?

449
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:35,167
Six.

450
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:36,730
- Wow.
- Yeah.

451
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:37,926
So you're 25.

452
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:40,968
26. In three days.

453
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:43,051
Happy early birthday.

454
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:47,206
I never thought I would be
one of those people that dread birthdays,

455
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:51,605
but it just feels like it's a reminder
that I'm not where I want to be.

456
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:52,847
Where did you want to be?

457
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:56,409
I thought by now,
I'd at least have my license.

458
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:57,965
I'd be a marriage counselor.

459
00:25:58,040 --> 00:26:00,520
I'd be on my way to starting my practice.
You know...

460
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:01,726
That's very noble, I think.

461
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:03,609
Marriage counselor,
that's a wonderful career.

462
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:04,841
You should totally do that.

463
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:07,845
You're super smart.
Look at what we just did.

464
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:10,731
Judith... I mean, you're bright.

465
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:12,450
You're intelligent. You're motivated.

466
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:16,206
Set up a business plan
and make it happen. Now.

467
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:24,051
Did I say something wrong?

468
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:28,169
No, it's actually very encouraging.

469
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:32,564
And you know I could totally help you
with this marriage counselor thing.

470
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,970
I mean, I have a successful business.
You can ask me anything.

471
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:40,009
What did you do different
than the rest of us?

472
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:42,560
Like, how'd you become
so successful so young?

473
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:45,642
I've always been ambitious.

474
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:48,491
Very much a workaholic. So...

475
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,690
What does that feel like?

476
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:00,400
Lonely.

477
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:05,890
It's kinda sad to be able to buy
whatever you want

478
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:08,771
and have to beg for what you need.

479
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:12,080
My last relationship was back in college.

480
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:16,131
I had met a wonderful woman.

481
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:21,681
Completely blew my mind
and I fell in love with her.

482
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:27,481
And she walked out on me

483
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:33,922
and I haven't really been able to rebound.
Since then.

484
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:40,041
Since college, huh? That's a long time.

485
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:43,242
I didn't even know she was unhappy.

486
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,326
Are you happy?

487
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:55,201
Yeah.

488
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:57,845
Yeah, very happy-

489
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:00,364
He's a great guy.

490
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:03,611
Good for you.

491
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:08,605
Especially good for him.

492
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,408
He's a very lucky man, Judith.

493
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:26,127
It's getting late.

494
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:29,170
Let's finish it tomorrow.

495
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:45,004
There was something I wanted to bring up
to you about the questionnaire.

496
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:46,161
Yeah?

497
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:50,370
I saw the questions about the
relationships, compatibility, the hobbies,

498
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:53,251
but there are no questions there about sex.

499
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:55,801
No,no,no.

500
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:58,571
I don't believe in sex before marriage,
so why would we need that?

501
00:28:58,640 --> 00:28:59,721
Really?

502
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:01,881
Yes.

503
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:04,529
Wait a second. Where are you from?

504
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:05,921
It's not about where I'm from.

505
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,890
It's called I'm a Christian.
I was raised that way.

506
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:11,122
So what you're saying is your husband

507
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:14,602
is the only guy you've ever been with. Ever.

508
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:16,205
- Yes.
- One guy.

509
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:20,011
Yes, and my husband and I
are very compatible.

510
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:21,969
How would you know how
sexually compatible you are

511
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:24,327
when you have nothing to compare it to?

512
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:31,280
I watch HBO.
I know I'm not missing anything.

513
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:42,886
I just keep picturing this same old, boring,

514
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:48,566
turn the lamp off, fluff the pillows,
always in the bedroom kinda thing.

515
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,689
What's wrong with the bedroom?

516
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:55,564
That's unfortunate.

517
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:58,090
If you were with another man,

518
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:01,368
you'd know that sex should be random.

519
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:02,886
Like animals.

520
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,729
When it happens, it just happens.

521
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:09,006
In the kitchen.

522
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:11,405
In the shower.

523
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:15,051
In the office. On a plane.

524
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:17,446
On the floor.

525
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:21,362
Are you getting turned on?

526
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:25,850
Please. You need to go home.

527
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:49,361
Hey, babe.

528
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:53,884
I made you a sandwich.

529
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,247
What's wrong?

530
00:30:58,160 --> 00:30:59,446
Okay. Okay.

531
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,526
- Now, baby, baby, attack me!
- Attack you?

532
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:04,523
- Yeah. Like an animal.
- Like an animal?

533
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:05,726
- Yeah, baby!
- Okay.

534
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:07,046
Just grab my hair!

535
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:09,088
- Wait, grab your hair?
- Yeah, and growl.

536
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:13,846
Yes, baby. Come on, open this shirt!

537
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:15,046
Okay, no. This is my new shirt.

538
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:16,167
Come on, come on!

539
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:18,481
- And scratch my back!
- Baby, hey! Hey! Scratch?

540
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:20,642
Look, this is weird.

541
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:22,131
We're not gonna do this.

542
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:24,921
I'm gonna forget you did this, okay?

543
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:28,130
Now, if you wanna growl at something,
you can growl at this sandwich.

544
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:32,641
After we finish eating, we can go
in the bedroom and do this the right way.

545
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:34,207
Okay?

546
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:37,366
Can I eat?

547
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:39,166
Thank you.

548
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:45,091
We could fluff the pillows,
turn off the lamps.

549
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:47,288
You know, do it the way we always do.

550
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:50,804
<i>It's going to be a great day
if you're planning on being outdoors.</i>

551
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:53,360
<i>So if you don't have to be
at work, or even if you do,</i>

552
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:56,171
<i>make sure you get outside
and enjoy the warm weather.</i>

553
00:31:56,240 --> 00:32:00,928
<i>As we are experiencing some
really nice above seasonal weather.</i>

554
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:06,601
<i>You can expect sunny highs in the mid-70s
and it could reach even as high as 78.</i>

555
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:09,041
<i>Northwest winds
are around five miles per hour,</i>

556
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:11,362
<i>becoming westerly in the afternoon.</i>

557
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:14,564
<i>Now, this high pressure
is moving in from the southwest</i>

558
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:18,645
<i>and it should be expected
to stay with us for the next couple of days.</i>

559
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:25,807
Good morning.

560
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,882
- Morning.
- How are you?

561
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:30,885
Good.

562
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:34,407
You knocked me out last night.

563
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:35,641
I know.

564
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:39,330
I didn't do my job too well,
if you're already up and running.

565
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:44,525
Just going for a Saturday morning run.
See you later.

566
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:12,444
Imagine me running into you.

567
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:15,205
What did you say?
I'm sorry, I can't hear you.

568
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:29,887
What?

569
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:31,846
What?

570
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:33,804
That's the trash-talking. That's what I hear.

571
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:35,848
I'm pacing myself.

572
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:37,684
Well, who's leaving who in the dust?

573
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:39,922
Hey, watch out, watch out!

574
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:41,605
I'm so sorry. You okay?

575
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:44,246
- What is your problem, man?
- I didn't see you.

576
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:45,965
Say something!
You gonna knock her down like that?

577
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:47,201
You'll hurt him. Harley, wait, wait!

578
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:48,731
No, Harley. No.

579
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:50,968
- Harley, I'm okay.
- Please! I'm really sorry.

580
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:52,849
I'm okay. I'm okay. I'm okay.

581
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:55,042
Just let him go. Just walk away.

582
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:59,200
I'm okay. Okay? I'm fine. I'm fine.

583
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:01,289
I'm okay. No, I'm okay.

584
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:03,326
Let's get you up here.

585
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:05,244
- Wait, wait, wait.
- That's good.

586
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:06,367
Let me go slow.

587
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:07,881
Wait, wait.

588
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:10,088
- Okay. All right, okay, this could be bad.
- Wait, wait, wait.

589
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:11,161
Let me call my husband.

590
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:12,407
No, I live close by here.

591
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:13,527
No,no,no.

592
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:15,329
No, I'll wrap it up,
I'll call my neighbor, he's a doctor.

593
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:16,845
Okay, all right,
but I still have to call, because...

594
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:18,524
No, either way, we gotta get your leg...

595
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:21,604
- No, no, no! Put me back down.
- No, listen! Hey!

596
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:25,123
I got you. Okay? All right.

597
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:37,721
You good?

598
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:38,881
Yeah.

599
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:41,726
Wow, this, this place is just incredible.

600
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:43,081
Thank you.

601
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:50,969
So he's not answering.

602
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:53,324
You know, it's actually feeling better.

603
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:54,561
Well, it's not swelling. That's a good thing.

604
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:55,880
I have to just walk it off.

605
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:57,041
No, let me see.

606
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:59,328
Just let me see it.

607
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:02,481
Hold on.

608
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:03,726
I don't know if I need all of that.

609
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:06,121
Just hold on one quick second.

610
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:12,642
Well, you're pretty good at it.

611
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:17,802
Yeah, it's just a little something
I picked up in college.

612
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:20,003
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

613
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:21,724
So was my husband.

614
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:24,121
Has a bunch of basketball injuries.

615
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:26,241
Really?

616
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:31,764
You talk about him a lot.

617
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:36,366
It's kinda what you do when you're married.

618
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:41,130
When he comes up,
it's kinda in comparison to me.

619
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:45,720
No, it's not.

620
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:48,123
Yeah, it actually is.

621
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:51,729
You wouldn't be comparing us, would you?

622
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:54,366
Why would I do that?

623
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:56,326
Well, you tell me.

624
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:59,681
Okay, my husband is not up for discussion.

625
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:02,201
- Well, you bring him up a lot.
- No, I do not.

626
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:08,209
Okay. I'm sorry.

627
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:12,729
I shouldn't have said anything about...

628
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:17,247
Look, it's just that,

629
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:20,804
on one hand,

630
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:23,402
I really wonder who this guy is.

631
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:27,128
And how special he must be
to have gotten you.

632
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:30,644
And on the other hand,
I wonder, does he even know it.

633
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:35,246
I wonder if he challenges you mentally.

634
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:37,921
Does he bring out the best in you?

635
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:40,569
Does he even notice you anymore?

636
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:42,927
- You know what? I'm not...
- Judith, listen.

637
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,365
Just listen.

638
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:48,409
If I had a woman as beautiful as you,

639
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:51,084
I wouldn't miss a thing.

640
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:58,611
Like the small blonde hairs
on the back of your neck.

641
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:02,601
Or how

642
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:06,284
your left temple throbs
when you're in deep thought.

643
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,081
How

644
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:13,367
calm you get when you're really excited.

645
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:15,601
Like right now.

646
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:22,606
That is very sexy.
How slow you're breathing.

647
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,889
Well, I don't miss anything either.

648
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:39,840
Like the smell of jasmine perfume
on this sofa that's obviously fresh.

649
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:44,486
Or those pair of high heels in your bedroom.

650
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:47,887
Those diamond earrings
on this coffee table.

651
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:54,170
Don't play with me, Harley.

652
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:59,042
Verbal sparring.

653
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:02,170
You know that's a sign I'm winning.

654
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:04,371
Winning what?

655
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:09,204
That must be Brice at the door.

656
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,321
- Brice? Your husband?
- Yeah.

657
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:14,727
I can't wait to meet this guy.

658
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:17,007
- Here, let me help.
- I can walk by myself.

659
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:18,525
I'm gonna help you, okay?

660
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:20,841
Here we go.

661
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:24,003
- See, I'm good.
- All right.

662
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:25,366
It's fine. Okay?

663
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:26,686
Hey, be careful.

664
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:32,920
- Hey! You must be Brice, right?
- Yeah.

665
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:34,651
Harley. Nice to meet you, man.

666
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:36,807
Hey, babe, what happened?

667
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:39,202
I fell down when I was running.

668
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:40,520
Harley helped me out, though.

669
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:42,444
- Thank you.
- No problem.

670
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:46,166
Thanks a lot, Harley, I'll see you later.

671
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:48,444
Yeah. Nice to meet you.

672
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:51,048
Likewise. Thanks again.

673
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:52,726
It's, you know, it's just...

674
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:02,008
- Good morning.
- Morning.

675
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:03,641
Babe, I was thinking.

676
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:05,688
Were you and Harley running together?

677
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:09,565
No, he just happened to be in the park.

678
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:11,641
Okay.

679
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:13,886
You look nice.

680
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:15,086
Thank you.

681
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:20,325
I'll be late tonight.
It's that mid-month inventory.

682
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:22,925
I hate the 15th.

683
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:27,849
Yeah. Your breakfast is on the table.

684
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:29,087
All right.

685
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:45,330
Do I have any calls?

686
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:47,447
Flowers!

687
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:49,124
Susan, do I have any messages?

688
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:51,447
I didn't know the 15th was your birthday.

689
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:53,409
Happy birthday. Here you go.

690
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:58,128
Hey, he remembered!

691
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:04,682
I left the apartment this morning so mad.

692
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:08,083
I thought my husband forgot my birthday.
But he didn't!

693
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:11,602
You are so excited about him. That is great.

694
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:18,050
Did you try something new? With your hair?

695
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:20,964
I sure did! I curled it.

696
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:23,202
And you see that green comb?
Right there in my hair?

697
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:24,930
Unfortunately, I do.

698
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:27,805
Is your fashion icon a Delta stewardess?

699
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:28,927
That's what you look like.

700
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:31,009
Oh, Ava.

701
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:32,605
- Is this wool?
- Yes.

702
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:34,887
-It's making me itch.
-It's a blend.

703
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:36,121
A blend of what?

704
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:38,601
Ava, can you just give me a break?
It's my birthday.

705
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:41,008
I tried to do something pretty with my hair.

706
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:43,766
I have these beautiful flowers
from my husband.

707
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,081
I'm smiling.

708
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:48,642
- Just give me a compliment or something.
- That was a compliment.

709
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:53,243
He's on his way up. Come on, we gotta go.

710
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:56,328
- Who? My husband?
- No, Harley.

711
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:58,169
Come on, we really gotta fix this.

712
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:00,402
- Is that spit?
- Watch my manicure!

713
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:03,689
- Why are you putting spit in my hair?
- I'm trying to be your friend here, Judith.

714
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:09,885
When people look at you
it reflects bad on me.

715
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,365
They don't think
you have a mirror or a friend.

716
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:12,680
And they know we're friends.

717
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,843
My friends don't look like this.

718
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,365
They look like this.

719
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:20,361
Ava, I think I look really pretty today.

720
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:23,330
I tried. I put on a little extra makeup.

721
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:25,488
That's not makeup. That's make down.

722
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:27,364
I'm matching today, too.

723
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:29,289
You know, you told me about that.

724
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:30,885
So you see this gold belt?

725
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:33,646
The gold belt goes with
the gold flappy things on my shoes.

726
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:36,360
And the blue shoes go with the blue dress.

727
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:40,247
Oh, my God!

728
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:41,881
What?

729
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:45,689
You're wearing flats?

730
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,844
My foot's all... It hurts a little bit.

731
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:51,122
Push me out of the window, why don't you?

732
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:53,284
I would love to.

733
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:58,522
Harley's here. Come on, we gotta go.

734
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:00,210
Enough with the coffee. No coffee breath.

735
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:02,846
Come on. No, no. Nope.

736
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:04,161
We gotta go.

737
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:07,560
Hi, Harley.

738
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:13,527
Hey-

739
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:14,887
Hey there.

740
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:16,087
How's your foot?

741
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:18,049
It's fine. Thanks.

742
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:20,091
Thanks for helping out the other day, too.

743
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:21,321
Yeah, no problem.

744
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:24,206
Brice just couldn't believe
you were so nice to me.

745
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:26,124
He wanted me to thank you for that.

746
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:28,448
Yeah, no worries. You changed your hair!

747
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:31,886
Little bit.

748
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:33,446
I like it.

749
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:35,771
Thank you.

750
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:38,091
Happy birthday.

751
00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:40,445
Thank you.

752
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:42,125
You like the flowers?

753
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:47,566
You sent these?

754
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:50,447
Yeah. Don't look so disappointed.

755
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:54,122
No, it's just...

756
00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:55,805
lt just said "Happy birthday, Judith."

757
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:57,763
It didn't say who it was from.

758
00:42:57,960 --> 00:42:59,371
No, I wanted to tell you in person.

759
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:01,488
I was gonna deliver them myself
when I came up,

760
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:04,040
but I just didn't really think
that was a good idea.

761
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:07,885
Yeah. Smart man.

762
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:09,561
Yes.

763
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:12,962
Okay. Come here for a second.
Let's sit down.

764
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:18,328
- Have a seat.
- All right.

765
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:22,531
Harley, I'm gonna be as honest as I can be.

766
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:24,565
What's going on?

767
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:27,802
You have plenty of programmers,

768
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:31,163
plenty of employees that could
come and help me with this project.

769
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:33,322
And yet you're coming here every day.

770
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:35,247
Why?

771
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:39,566
Judith, I find you extremely beautiful, okay?

772
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:45,842
And interesting. And if I have to
come here myself to be around you, I will.

773
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,924
I just wanna be involved with you.
Intimately.

774
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:52,763
And as long as you know
that I'm very married...

775
00:43:55,240 --> 00:43:56,480
Point taken.

776
00:43:57,560 --> 00:43:58,766
He loves you.

777
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,764
I saw that when he picked you up.

778
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:05,047
He's kinda regular. But lucky.

779
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:08,362
You just don't impress me
as the type of person

780
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:10,681
that would be satisfied with a man like that.

781
00:44:11,960 --> 00:44:14,327
Maybe at one point in time, in your life.

782
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:16,883
But where you're going,

783
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:19,050
I just don't see that lasting.

784
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:28,725
You don't know him.

785
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:45,489
- Hi.
- Hey.

786
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:47,725
Crazy day today.

787
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:48,881
Yeah?

788
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:51,601
Yeah.

789
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:54,926
I was trying to finish up all that inventory.

790
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:18,410
Babe, I'm sorry.

791
00:45:23,560 --> 00:45:26,086
It's the second year in a row, Brice.

792
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:30,604
Babe, I just got a little carried away
with work, that's all.

793
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:35,209
Yeah. I understand. It's all good.

794
00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:38,281
No, no, let me take you out or something.

795
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:44,561
No. I have this really big assignment
for work and I got a lot to do.

796
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:47,810
Babe, I'm sorry.

797
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:51,204
Brice, it's okay.

798
00:45:52,600 --> 00:45:53,965
Don't worry about it.

799
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:28,680
<i>She may be weary</i>

800
00:46:30,520 --> 00:46:33,364
<i>Them young girls
They do get weary</i>

801
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:39,610
<i>Wearing that
same old shaggy dress</i>

802
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,001
<i>Yeah</i>

803
00:46:44,840 --> 00:46:47,525
<i>But when she gets weary</i>

804
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:54,448
<i>Try a little tenderness</i>

805
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:55,851
<i>Yeah, yeah</i>

806
00:46:57,320 --> 00:46:58,401
<i>Oh, now, now</i>

807
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:04,400
<i>You won't regret it
No, no</i>

808
00:47:06,520 --> 00:47:08,443
<i>Young girls
They don't forget it</i>

809
00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:14,644
<i>Love is their own happiness</i>

810
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:16,324
You're silly.

811
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:22,889
<i>But it's all so easy</i>

812
00:47:24,360 --> 00:47:26,124
<i>All you gotta do is try</i>

813
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:30,042
<i>Try a little tenderness</i>

814
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:34,522
<i>All you got to do is, man</i>

815
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:36,682
<i>Hold her when you wanna</i>

816
00:47:38,040 --> 00:47:39,644
Happy birthday, baby.

817
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:41,930
I'm sorry.

818
00:47:50,560 --> 00:47:53,769
All right, girls,
let's make some dreams happen.

819
00:47:55,400 --> 00:48:00,088
Judith, you have been requested
to accompany Harley

820
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:01,764
to New Orleans for a meeting.

821
00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:03,681
Really?

822
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:05,922
Yes. He's presenting to his shareholders

823
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,764
and he wants you there.

824
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:10,851
Okay, well, when do we leave?

825
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:13,287
Oh, no, darling, just you.

826
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:15,250
I think he likes you.

827
00:48:15,720 --> 00:48:20,123
Now, I know you're married,
but just flirt a little.

828
00:48:20,280 --> 00:48:22,760
Get the deal closed.
Don't compromise yourself.

829
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:25,122
But just flirt.

830
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:28,086
I understand.

831
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:30,485
I know I don't know you very well,

832
00:48:30,560 --> 00:48:33,530
but I want you to know
exactly what you're getting yourself into.

833
00:48:36,360 --> 00:48:38,601
This is a big deal for me and this place.

834
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:41,246
And I want it in the worst way.

835
00:48:42,080 --> 00:48:43,320
That being said,

836
00:48:44,040 --> 00:48:47,408
I will tell you like I tell all my girls
who go out with my guys.

837
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:51,801
Be nice. Be aware. Have fun.

838
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:55,291
But most of all, be careful.

839
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:58,325
I know you're a smart girl,

840
00:48:59,160 --> 00:49:01,162
but this is another league you're in.

841
00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:05,126
Trust me.

842
00:49:17,960 --> 00:49:20,930
<i>A couple of senatorial retirement
announcements this week,</i>

843
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:25,005
<i>highlighting what has been
a gradual rolling back of the GOP's...</i>

844
00:49:25,240 --> 00:49:26,685
Hello. Can I help you?

845
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:30,083
Hi. Do you think you can tell me
how to get to Johnson Jewelry?

846
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:32,606
I'm a little turned around.
I'm kind of new in town.

847
00:49:32,680 --> 00:49:34,842
You want East Jefferson.

848
00:49:34,920 --> 00:49:37,002
This is West Jefferson.

849
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:38,850
That's on the other side of town.

850
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:40,121
Thank you. Thank you so much.

851
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:05,601
What? We're back to this again?

852
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:07,523
Did you not have
a good birthday or something?

853
00:50:10,360 --> 00:50:12,044
My husband forgot.

854
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:16,044
He forgot?
I thought he sent you flowers yesterday.

855
00:50:17,560 --> 00:50:19,369
No, they weren't from him.

856
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:21,890
He didn't even remember.

857
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:27,249
I mean, he tried.
It's just the second year in a row.

858
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:29,251
You are forgettable.

859
00:50:29,800 --> 00:50:32,804
Honey, you have to make
a man remember you.

860
00:50:33,080 --> 00:50:35,651
I've tried to give you my assistance,
but you don't want it,

861
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:37,000
so get out.

862
00:50:38,560 --> 00:50:40,210
All right, you win.

863
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:44,246
Win what?

864
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:48,523
The hair, the makeup, the clothes.

865
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:50,525
Do whatever you wanna do.

866
00:50:51,160 --> 00:50:53,527
Are you kidding? Oh, my God. Thank you.

867
00:50:53,600 --> 00:50:56,444
I have been dying
to get my hands on this hair.

868
00:50:56,600 --> 00:50:57,726
Come on. Come on.

869
00:51:11,960 --> 00:51:15,362
Look. Look at the bags,
the shoes, purses, everything.

870
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:17,363
I dream of this room.

871
00:51:17,560 --> 00:51:18,766
Look at this.

872
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:20,041
Where are we right now?

873
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:23,050
This is the place that Janice
sends the girls that she's not happy with

874
00:51:23,120 --> 00:51:24,281
before, you know, she sets them up.

875
00:51:24,440 --> 00:51:27,808
So this is what I call Couture Heaven.

876
00:51:28,040 --> 00:51:29,451
All right, let's get started.

877
00:51:29,880 --> 00:51:30,961
Wow.

878
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:32,883
There's so much to do with you
in so little time.

879
00:51:33,080 --> 00:51:34,605
What do you think of this?

880
00:51:35,800 --> 00:51:37,564
Wow. What kind of fabric is this?

881
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:40,650
One that's never been on your back.
It's called expensive.

882
00:51:42,560 --> 00:51:44,164
Good morning. Good morning.

883
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:47,881
What's wrong?

884
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:51,370
Her ex came in here. Tell him, honey.

885
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:54,642
I've been hiding from him.

886
00:51:55,320 --> 00:51:57,209
Running from him for years.

887
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:02,043
Changed my name. I moved here and...

888
00:52:02,760 --> 00:52:04,444
I can't believe he's here.

889
00:52:08,280 --> 00:52:09,850
I'm gonna have to quit.

890
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:11,844
Well, where are you gonna go?

891
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:14,086
I don't know.

892
00:52:17,080 --> 00:52:18,570
I'm tired of starting over.

893
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:21,201
Look, maybe he just
stumbled in here on accident.

894
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:23,363
Do you know how many people
live in this city?

895
00:52:23,960 --> 00:52:27,521
You can't keep running
from someone your whole life.

896
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:30,524
You don't understand.

897
00:52:32,120 --> 00:52:35,169
When we first met, he wined and dined me.

898
00:52:36,280 --> 00:52:39,887
Made me feel like I was
the luckiest woman in the world.

899
00:52:43,120 --> 00:52:47,682
Then things started to unravel.

900
00:52:50,560 --> 00:52:52,722
And I don't know if it was the drugs

901
00:52:53,080 --> 00:52:55,560
or if he was really mentally ill.

902
00:52:56,480 --> 00:52:58,608
He just started to change.

903
00:52:59,160 --> 00:53:02,528
And just became evil.

904
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:08,768
Like he was two different people.

905
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:18,206
He tried to kill me.

906
00:53:21,800 --> 00:53:24,007
I just can't see you
being with a guy like that.

907
00:53:25,240 --> 00:53:27,891
Sometimes you never know
who you're married to.

908
00:53:28,920 --> 00:53:33,005
People start off one way
and end up somebody else.

909
00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:36,006
One night, he was on that couch...

910
00:53:36,200 --> 00:53:39,170
I ran and I never looked back after that.

911
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:43,167
Look, Melinda, you can't quit.

912
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:44,770
What am I supposed to do?

913
00:53:45,560 --> 00:53:46,607
We'll help you.

914
00:53:47,840 --> 00:53:50,286
We'll pick you up and drop you off.

915
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:52,727
We?

916
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:54,441
Miss Waco.

917
00:53:54,840 --> 00:53:55,887
What?

918
00:53:56,280 --> 00:53:57,361
I'll help you.

919
00:53:57,720 --> 00:54:00,007
Yeah, he'll protect you.

920
00:54:00,280 --> 00:54:02,089
Don't throw away what you found here.

921
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:05,042
Do you know what we all need?

922
00:54:06,560 --> 00:54:07,971
Is a Valium.

923
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:13,529
I have a whole room full of them.

924
00:54:44,080 --> 00:54:45,127
Good morning.

925
00:54:45,320 --> 00:54:46,481
Thank you.

926
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:51,445
Please watch your step.

927
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:03,321
Hello.

928
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:05,847
Hi.

929
00:55:06,800 --> 00:55:11,203
You gonna fly standing up
or you gonna have a seat?

930
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:16,171
Yeah. Right. I Will.

931
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:20,281
All right.

932
00:55:20,360 --> 00:55:23,967
So, is this your plane? Like, it all is?

933
00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:26,049
- Like, all the parts and everything.
- Yeah.

934
00:55:26,920 --> 00:55:28,922
Wow. That's cool.

935
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:30,604
You know, I was thinkin'.
When we leave New Orleans,

936
00:55:30,720 --> 00:55:34,008
maybe we can head over to Paris.
Or New York.

937
00:55:34,200 --> 00:55:35,804
All this work we're trying to focus on

938
00:55:35,880 --> 00:55:37,245
and you're talking about
Paris and New York?

939
00:55:37,880 --> 00:55:41,202
If you were mine, you wouldn't have to work.

940
00:55:43,720 --> 00:55:45,882
If you were mine,
you wouldn't be on this plane right now.

941
00:55:46,040 --> 00:55:47,405
Your butt would be at a pharmacy.

942
00:55:47,640 --> 00:55:48,846
That's the handout for the board meeting.

943
00:55:49,880 --> 00:55:51,041
Champagne, sir?

944
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:54,247
Thank you.

945
00:55:54,320 --> 00:55:55,401
You're welcome.

946
00:55:55,520 --> 00:55:57,090
- Something for you?
- Thanks, I'm fine.

947
00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:33,571
Look at you.

948
00:57:35,080 --> 00:57:37,481
Champagne. Private jet.

949
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,765
You look amazing, by the way.

950
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,810
Man, this view is just incredible.

951
00:57:53,520 --> 00:57:54,681
What?

952
00:57:57,280 --> 00:57:59,282
It's just refreshing to see someone

953
00:57:59,360 --> 00:58:01,283
experience this side of life for the first time.

954
00:58:01,360 --> 00:58:03,681
You know? it is. it excites me.

955
00:58:04,360 --> 00:58:05,361
Whatever.

956
00:58:05,480 --> 00:58:09,769
You know you take people on this plane
all the time and excite them.

957
00:58:10,040 --> 00:58:12,725
Just my ex.

958
00:58:14,160 --> 00:58:16,561
This was no big deal for her.

959
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:24,249
I really hate being taken for granted.

960
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:26,326
Don't you?

961
00:58:28,680 --> 00:58:29,886
Yeah.

962
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:36,880
How would that make you feel
when she would do that?

963
00:58:38,240 --> 00:58:40,891
The opposite of how this makes you feel.

964
00:58:43,280 --> 00:58:45,282
How does this make me feel?

965
00:58:49,640 --> 00:58:51,005
Special.

966
00:58:52,360 --> 00:58:53,691
Important.

967
00:58:55,360 --> 00:58:56,725
Wanted.

968
00:58:59,920 --> 00:59:01,160
Am I right?

969
00:59:03,920 --> 00:59:06,002
You should feel that way all the time.

970
00:59:06,200 --> 00:59:07,725
This stuff didn't matter to her.

971
00:59:08,360 --> 00:59:11,091
The more I tried,
the more she shot me down.

972
00:59:14,440 --> 00:59:16,283
I think I just love too hard.

973
00:59:17,360 --> 00:59:19,089
I do. I fall.

974
00:59:20,280 --> 00:59:23,568
Before I know it, I'm just... I'm gone.

975
00:59:25,440 --> 00:59:26,646
What do you mean, "gone"?

976
00:59:27,120 --> 00:59:29,566
Just crazy.

977
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:33,970
Crazy in love. You know?

978
00:59:34,120 --> 00:59:37,602
So I've learned to keep
my true feelings inside

979
00:59:37,800 --> 00:59:41,441
because most women
can't handle the kind of emotion that I bring.

980
00:59:43,120 --> 00:59:44,360
What does that mean?

981
00:59:45,120 --> 00:59:46,929
Well, I can come on really strong.

982
00:59:48,640 --> 00:59:50,085
How so?

983
00:59:51,960 --> 00:59:54,804
I want to make love to you. Right now.

984
00:59:59,800 --> 01:00:01,802
That's the kind of thing I'd say to her.

985
01:00:05,120 --> 01:00:07,441
You are so beautiful.

986
01:00:09,880 --> 01:00:11,120
Thank you.

987
01:00:19,160 --> 01:00:20,241
What?

988
01:00:20,320 --> 01:00:21,924
I was talking about my ex.

989
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:25,721
But you are beautiful, though. You are.

990
01:00:27,400 --> 01:00:28,526
You are.

991
01:00:29,160 --> 01:00:30,321
Thank you.

992
01:00:31,800 --> 01:00:34,451
One compliment does deserve another.

993
01:00:38,640 --> 01:00:43,282
I think we are better off
just keeping it professional.

994
01:00:43,800 --> 01:00:45,404
You know we're way past that.

995
01:00:48,680 --> 01:00:51,365
I find myself very attracted to you.

996
01:00:53,520 --> 01:00:56,046
I find myself very married.

997
01:00:57,840 --> 01:01:01,481
Happily married, right?

998
01:01:06,320 --> 01:01:07,890
A guy can dream, right?

999
01:01:12,040 --> 01:01:13,724
I can't stop you from dreaming.

1000
01:01:15,720 --> 01:01:17,210
What do you dream about?

1001
01:01:25,040 --> 01:01:31,082
I used to dream about helping people
and starting my own practice.

1002
01:01:31,200 --> 01:01:33,567
But I graduated college and reality hit.

1003
01:01:34,720 --> 01:01:36,722
I don't really dream anymore.

1004
01:01:38,680 --> 01:01:40,921
You know all that could easily be reality.

1005
01:01:45,560 --> 01:01:47,164
What do you dream about?

1006
01:01:49,160 --> 01:01:50,241
You.

1007
01:01:56,760 --> 01:01:58,444
You ever dream about me?

1008
01:02:02,360 --> 01:02:03,771
I have a husband.

1009
01:02:05,520 --> 01:02:07,284
Yeah. I know.

1010
01:02:10,080 --> 01:02:11,127
Do you want me?

1011
01:02:27,400 --> 01:02:28,925
What are you doing?

1012
01:02:30,120 --> 01:02:31,451
Harley, stop it.

1013
01:02:31,840 --> 01:02:32,887
I don't want to.

1014
01:02:33,600 --> 01:02:34,806
Harley, stop it.

1015
01:02:35,120 --> 01:02:36,360
Please, Harley.

1016
01:02:37,120 --> 01:02:38,724
Please. Stop.

1017
01:02:40,120 --> 01:02:42,646
Get off of me. Get off of me!

1018
01:02:42,880 --> 01:02:46,965
Get! Get off of me!

1019
01:02:47,320 --> 01:02:48,401
Just stop!

1020
01:02:48,800 --> 01:02:49,801
Stop it. Stop.

1021
01:02:49,880 --> 01:02:50,881
- You stop.
- Stop it.

1022
01:02:52,880 --> 01:02:54,769
Now you can say you resisted.

1023
01:03:35,080 --> 01:03:36,081
Are you okay?

1024
01:03:37,840 --> 01:03:39,808
I don't wanna ever see you again.

1025
01:03:40,520 --> 01:03:42,966
If you need anything, Janice can help you.

1026
01:03:43,440 --> 01:03:45,010
Okay, Judith, hold on a second, please.

1027
01:03:45,080 --> 01:03:46,889
- I will not do this. I can't.
- Wait.

1028
01:03:46,960 --> 01:03:48,086
Judith, are you sure about this?

1029
01:03:48,160 --> 01:03:49,127
- Wait a second.
- I mean it.

1030
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:52,488
Wait, wait.
Let me talk to you real quick. Hold on.

1031
01:03:53,960 --> 01:03:56,201
Are you sure you want to do this? Really?

1032
01:03:57,680 --> 01:03:59,364
- Thank you, son.
- No problem.

1033
01:04:00,280 --> 01:04:01,281
Judith.

1034
01:04:02,280 --> 01:04:03,406
Hey-

1035
01:04:08,320 --> 01:04:11,324
Harley, you remember my husband, Brice.

1036
01:04:11,400 --> 01:04:12,526
Hey, how you doin', man?

1037
01:04:13,640 --> 01:04:14,687
Hi.

1038
01:04:15,400 --> 01:04:16,845
That is a beautiful car.

1039
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:18,521
Thank you.

1040
01:04:21,920 --> 01:04:22,921
Hey, Mama.

1041
01:04:23,560 --> 01:04:24,561
This your mother?

1042
01:04:27,240 --> 01:04:28,241
Harley.

1043
01:04:30,400 --> 01:04:32,050
Reverend Sarah Ogalvee.

1044
01:04:32,120 --> 01:04:33,121
It's a pleasure.

1045
01:04:35,120 --> 01:04:38,408
Thanks so much for the ride, Harley.
Appreciate that.

1046
01:04:40,120 --> 01:04:41,360
Okay. Y'all have a good night.

1047
01:04:41,480 --> 01:04:42,845
Yeah. Let's get you in, Miss Sarah.

1048
01:04:42,920 --> 01:04:43,921
All right, son.

1049
01:04:44,600 --> 01:04:45,601
Hi, Mom.

1050
01:04:45,760 --> 01:04:47,842
Sweetheart, how you doin'?

1051
01:04:47,920 --> 01:04:50,287
- You made it, huh?
- So happy to see you.

1052
01:05:53,480 --> 01:05:57,405
Sweetness, that was an awfully pretty dress
I saw you in earlier.

1053
01:05:59,960 --> 01:06:02,122
- Yeah, you looked nice, babe.
- Thanks.

1054
01:06:02,200 --> 01:06:03,929
My boss gave it to me.

1055
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,082
She wants us to start dressing like that.

1056
01:06:08,520 --> 01:06:09,965
You're not gonna say grace?

1057
01:06:13,160 --> 01:06:15,003
Okay, yeah.

1058
01:06:16,080 --> 01:06:17,366
God, thank you for this food.

1059
01:06:17,640 --> 01:06:19,881
Bless it and purify it.
In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.

1060
01:06:20,440 --> 01:06:24,604
In Jesus' name we pray.
And we thank you, Lord. Amen.

1061
01:06:24,680 --> 01:06:25,681
Amen.

1062
01:06:26,280 --> 01:06:28,328
Miss Sarah, I'm always happy
when you're around.

1063
01:06:28,520 --> 01:06:29,760
I get to have a home-cooked meal.

1064
01:06:29,880 --> 01:06:31,848
Daughter, you not cooking
for your husband?

1065
01:06:35,120 --> 01:06:36,360
Yes, I am.

1066
01:06:38,880 --> 01:06:42,123
Well, she does, but lately,
she's been working a lot.

1067
01:06:42,200 --> 01:06:45,363
Right. With the man in the red, fast car?

1068
01:06:46,160 --> 01:06:48,891
No. I mean, I don't work with him that often.

1069
01:06:49,040 --> 01:06:50,724
And you know, he's a nice guy.

1070
01:06:50,840 --> 01:06:51,887
Nice guy?

1071
01:06:52,400 --> 01:06:54,528
That don't mean nothin'
if he don't know the Lord.

1072
01:06:56,320 --> 01:06:59,927
"It's easier for a camel
to enter into the eye of a needle

1073
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:04,722
"than it is for a rich man
to enter into the kingdom of heaven."

1074
01:07:05,880 --> 01:07:08,690
Yes, Mama, I know. You say that a lot.

1075
01:07:09,080 --> 01:07:12,368
But there's nothing wrong
with being rich or having nice things.

1076
01:07:12,720 --> 01:07:15,087
Long as nice things don't have you.

1077
01:07:15,560 --> 01:07:16,561
Amen.

1078
01:07:17,160 --> 01:07:19,003
Well, our business is over anyway, so...

1079
01:07:19,080 --> 01:07:20,684
Well, then that's good, isn't it?

1080
01:07:21,680 --> 01:07:22,886
Yeah.

1081
01:07:24,240 --> 01:07:28,928
You know, baby, it's been a long time
since you been to the house of the Lord.

1082
01:07:32,760 --> 01:07:35,604
I told her we rest on Sundays.

1083
01:07:39,520 --> 01:07:42,410
You know, with your job,
you need to be in church.

1084
01:07:42,480 --> 01:07:45,802
Could build spiritual strength up
to deal with those demons, girl.

1085
01:07:47,520 --> 01:07:49,045
I don't work with demons.

1086
01:07:49,440 --> 01:07:51,488
Isn't that what you said to me on the phone?

1087
01:07:52,760 --> 01:07:54,125
I know, but...

1088
01:07:54,240 --> 01:07:56,163
Okay, I guess I was wrong.

1089
01:07:56,440 --> 01:07:58,363
Mama, not everybody's a demon.

1090
01:07:58,600 --> 01:08:00,443
Well, I know that.

1091
01:08:00,960 --> 01:08:02,883
I'm just voicing my concern.

1092
01:08:03,280 --> 01:08:05,089
We don't talk anymore.

1093
01:08:05,880 --> 01:08:08,360
You don't call in for your morning prayers.

1094
01:08:10,280 --> 01:08:13,090
Well, it's just I get up so early.

1095
01:08:13,160 --> 01:08:15,527
You know, I have to take
the bus every morning.

1096
01:08:15,920 --> 01:08:17,206
At 9:00 a.m.

1097
01:08:17,760 --> 01:08:20,650
Prayer starts at 6:00 a.m. every morning.

1098
01:08:20,840 --> 01:08:22,683
All the sisters be on the line.

1099
01:08:23,200 --> 01:08:26,409
I know you busy, baby.
I know that, but you could call in sometime.

1100
01:08:26,480 --> 01:08:27,481
Just once in a while.

1101
01:08:27,560 --> 01:08:29,608
All right, I will. I will. How long you staying?

1102
01:08:32,280 --> 01:08:35,170
I done got on your nerves.
I'm sorry, please forgive me.

1103
01:08:35,240 --> 01:08:37,481
You're not bothering me. It's fine.

1104
01:08:37,560 --> 01:08:39,164
I'm just gonna go dry my hair.

1105
01:08:40,520 --> 01:08:41,646
Everything all right, sweetness?

1106
01:08:41,760 --> 01:08:43,762
Yeah. I just don't wanna catch a cold.

1107
01:08:46,200 --> 01:08:48,885
That's not like her not to want her food.

1108
01:08:49,520 --> 01:08:52,046
Yeah, I think she's mad at me, Miss Sarah.

1109
01:08:52,520 --> 01:08:55,046
I forgot her birthday
and now I'm talking about her cooking.

1110
01:08:55,720 --> 01:08:57,563
How you goin' forget her birthday?

1111
01:09:00,160 --> 01:09:02,083
You need your ass whipped.

1112
01:09:02,320 --> 01:09:04,163
Miss Sarah,
you ain't supposed to be cursin'.

1113
01:09:04,360 --> 01:09:06,442
That's the King James Version.

1114
01:09:08,120 --> 01:09:09,849
It's all right, honey. Eat your food.

1115
01:09:21,680 --> 01:09:22,841
You all right?

1116
01:09:23,400 --> 01:09:24,890
I can't believe you.

1117
01:09:25,680 --> 01:09:26,966
What did I do now?

1118
01:09:27,160 --> 01:09:28,810
Why would you tell her all that stuff?

1119
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:31,446
She asked.
And you know how your mother is.

1120
01:09:31,560 --> 01:09:32,721
I can't lie to her.

1121
01:09:32,920 --> 01:09:35,605
- Whatever.
-It's like she looks right through me.

1122
01:09:35,680 --> 01:09:37,887
You know what? I'm going to bed.

1123
01:09:39,200 --> 01:09:41,282
Do I need to go get my guitar?

1124
01:09:41,720 --> 01:09:42,846
Good night.

1125
01:10:01,440 --> 01:10:04,762
Is it important for your partner
to support your hobbies?

1126
01:10:05,040 --> 01:10:07,964
Yes. I think it's very important for me
for that to happen, yeah.

1127
01:10:08,520 --> 01:10:11,330
Yeah, I think over the years,

1128
01:10:11,560 --> 01:10:15,451
with all my concentration
on my business, on success,

1129
01:10:16,440 --> 01:10:19,728
I was afraid that I would give up
a part of myself, if I...

1130
01:10:19,800 --> 01:10:20,881
Are you listening to me?

1131
01:10:23,680 --> 01:10:25,648
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I...

1132
01:10:25,720 --> 01:10:26,846
You don't want someone
that's gonna change you.

1133
01:10:26,920 --> 01:10:27,842
Yeah.

1134
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:29,490
<i>Jeff stepping in front.</i>

1135
01:10:29,560 --> 01:10:32,484
<i>He's coming back,
doing battle against his old squad.</i>

1136
01:10:32,560 --> 01:10:34,608
<i>Play action. Down the middle. intercepted.</i>

1137
01:10:34,920 --> 01:10:36,331
Come on!

1138
01:10:36,400 --> 01:10:38,164
- Babe, <i>you see that?
- Intercepted by Kleinsmith.</i>

1139
01:10:38,360 --> 01:10:39,805
Don't throw the ball in all that traffic.

1140
01:10:39,920 --> 01:10:41,649
<i>Down the sidelines, out of bounds,</i>

1141
01:10:41,720 --> 01:10:45,441
<i>across the 45 yard line of... Indiana to 47.</i>

1142
01:10:48,320 --> 01:10:51,290
<i>Joe Kleinsmith.
He gets up limping off that play.</i>

1143
01:10:51,840 --> 01:10:54,969
<i>But he's got an interception
and a 38 yard return.</i>

1144
01:10:55,800 --> 01:10:59,043
<i>Kleinsmith doing a nice job of just
reading the eyes of the quarterback.</i>

1145
01:10:59,120 --> 01:11:01,487
<i>Quarterback's gonna tell you
where he's going with the ball.</i>

1146
01:11:03,320 --> 01:11:05,687
So is this what you wanted, huh?

1147
01:11:05,880 --> 01:11:10,522
You wanted to just have sex with me
and just ignore me after that?

1148
01:11:10,600 --> 01:11:14,730
<i>You come to the office.
You don't say "Hi." You don't call anybody.</i>

1149
01:11:15,320 --> 01:11:17,971
<i>You were the one that said you were married
and you couldn't do this, right?</i>

1150
01:11:18,040 --> 01:11:19,121
Right?

1151
01:11:19,200 --> 01:11:21,521
<i>Why does it even matter
if I call you or not, Judith? Really?</i>

1152
01:11:21,720 --> 01:11:23,210
<i>Why are you doing this?</i>

1153
01:11:23,720 --> 01:11:24,926
What are you talking about?

1154
01:11:25,040 --> 01:11:27,202
I'm not a man that likes to play
these little silly games, Judith.

1155
01:11:27,400 --> 01:11:28,811
<i>I'm not playing any games.</i>

1156
01:11:29,280 --> 01:11:33,080
<i>Well, if you want me, then you say it.
All right?</i>

1157
01:11:33,680 --> 01:11:36,843
<i>Live for once in your life,
Judith, damn, come on!</i>

1158
01:11:37,040 --> 01:11:39,042
It's not that easy. Okay?

1159
01:11:39,160 --> 01:11:40,207
Where is he right now?

1160
01:11:41,400 --> 01:11:42,640
He's watching the game.

1161
01:11:42,840 --> 01:11:44,205
Touchdown!

1162
01:11:45,040 --> 01:11:46,087
Yes!

1163
01:11:46,880 --> 01:11:47,961
Put him on the phone.

1164
01:11:48,160 --> 01:11:49,241
Will you stop it?

1165
01:11:49,320 --> 01:11:50,526
<i>No, put him on the phone, Judith.</i>

1166
01:11:50,720 --> 01:11:52,245
No. Just stop it.

1167
01:11:52,440 --> 01:11:54,886
<i>Why doesn't he wonder who
you're talking to on the phone right now?</i>

1168
01:11:54,960 --> 01:11:56,200
Because he doesn't do that.

1169
01:11:56,480 --> 01:11:59,211
If you were mine, I'd want to know.

1170
01:12:02,200 --> 01:12:04,407
Well, I'm not yours, am I?

1171
01:12:04,920 --> 01:12:06,206
Well, you could be.

1172
01:12:10,280 --> 01:12:12,044
Does he make love to you better than me?

1173
01:12:14,720 --> 01:12:17,087
I don't think anyone
makes love better than you.

1174
01:12:23,320 --> 01:12:24,765
Tell me you want me.

1175
01:12:26,040 --> 01:12:27,121
<i>Say it.</i>

1176
01:12:30,480 --> 01:12:31,766
I want you.

1177
01:12:32,600 --> 01:12:34,125
<i>Come see me right now.</i>

1178
01:12:34,800 --> 01:12:36,484
I'll pick you up
on the corner of Wilmont and 3rd.

1179
01:12:36,680 --> 01:12:38,682
I can't. I can't be there.

1180
01:12:38,880 --> 01:12:42,282
I'm making dinner. And it's what? It's 8:30.

1181
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:45,240
I just can't.

1182
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,401
Hello? Hello?

1183
01:12:54,360 --> 01:12:55,771
Pass the ball!

1184
01:12:55,840 --> 01:12:59,606
<i>Look out! Leslie Majors on the run.</i>

1185
01:13:02,040 --> 01:13:03,371
<i>Inside the Sycamore 40, out of bounds.</i>

1186
01:13:03,480 --> 01:13:05,050
Dinner's ready, honey.

1187
01:13:05,240 --> 01:13:07,129
Mom, I'm sorry, that was my boss.

1188
01:13:07,200 --> 01:13:09,487
She just called.
She needs me to run an errand.

1189
01:13:09,560 --> 01:13:10,641
What?

1190
01:13:10,720 --> 01:13:12,882
I know, it's ridiculous. I'll see y'all later.

1191
01:13:12,960 --> 01:13:14,007
Well...

1192
01:13:14,080 --> 01:13:15,809
<i>...coming back for the football,
breaking off his route.</i>

1193
01:13:15,880 --> 01:13:18,201
<i>Going down, getting the feet inbounds.
You see it there.</i>

1194
01:13:18,280 --> 01:13:21,090
- That happen a lot?
- No, no, no!

1195
01:13:21,160 --> 01:13:22,321
<i>Lewis able to pick up. Can he make...</i>

1196
01:13:50,240 --> 01:13:51,571
Here you go.

1197
01:13:54,120 --> 01:13:55,804
What's that?

1198
01:13:57,160 --> 01:13:58,650
You really are from the country, aren't you?

1199
01:13:58,800 --> 01:14:00,882
You've never even tried this before.
Let me give you a little bit.

1200
01:14:00,960 --> 01:14:03,964
No,no,no.
I'm just gonna stick with the wine.

1201
01:14:04,160 --> 01:14:05,286
You trust me, right?

1202
01:14:07,040 --> 01:14:08,530
Of course.

1203
01:14:09,440 --> 01:14:10,566
Go ahead.

1204
01:14:13,680 --> 01:14:14,841
All right, Well...

1205
01:14:19,440 --> 01:14:20,487
I've been thinking.

1206
01:14:21,320 --> 01:14:23,448
Instead of going into business with Janice.

1207
01:14:24,520 --> 01:14:27,285
You and me, we should start
that marriage counselor thing.

1208
01:14:27,520 --> 01:14:29,522
Get that office open. I'd do that for you.

1209
01:14:32,440 --> 01:14:34,761
- Are you serious? Really?
- Yeah.

1210
01:14:34,840 --> 01:14:35,966
You would do that?

1211
01:14:37,240 --> 01:14:38,605
One catch, though.

1212
01:14:42,360 --> 01:14:43,725
You have to be mine.

1213
01:14:49,480 --> 01:14:51,369
What do I do about Brice though?

1214
01:14:54,480 --> 01:14:57,211
Okay, we talked about Brice, babe.

1215
01:14:57,720 --> 01:14:58,881
You leave him.

1216
01:14:59,360 --> 01:15:03,206
Harley, I already feel so bad though,
about what we're doing.

1217
01:15:03,560 --> 01:15:04,641
Then why are you here?

1218
01:15:06,560 --> 01:15:08,005
You know why I'm here.

1219
01:15:09,040 --> 01:15:10,929
Why don't you just go home?
Get out of my house.

1220
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:13,651
Shit if I'm gon' try and play
these little games with you. No, go.

1221
01:15:13,720 --> 01:15:15,131
What are you talking about?

1222
01:15:15,360 --> 01:15:16,441
Go.

1223
01:15:16,680 --> 01:15:19,331
You realize that you're
kicking me out your house.

1224
01:15:19,400 --> 01:15:20,811
You know what? Fine then.

1225
01:15:21,840 --> 01:15:23,808
Forget it. Asshole!

1226
01:15:23,880 --> 01:15:25,041
Fine!

1227
01:15:26,080 --> 01:15:29,004
Fine! Don't ever ask me
to cook or come over again.

1228
01:15:29,080 --> 01:15:30,081
Bastard!

1229
01:15:30,720 --> 01:15:33,451
Don't call me again, you jackass.

1230
01:15:53,080 --> 01:15:55,003
You comin' in awfully late.

1231
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:01,002
- Where's Brice?
- What's wrong with you?

1232
01:16:02,240 --> 01:16:05,528
Nothing, Mama. My boss made me upset.

1233
01:16:06,040 --> 01:16:08,611
Brice is in the bed. What's wrong with you?

1234
01:16:09,120 --> 01:16:11,407
I'm just gonna take a shower, okay?

1235
01:16:12,080 --> 01:16:13,286
You been drinking?

1236
01:16:15,040 --> 01:16:17,520
I had a glass of wine. All right?

1237
01:16:17,600 --> 01:16:19,602
With that devil in the red car.

1238
01:16:20,720 --> 01:16:24,327
No, not with him. And he ain't no devil.

1239
01:16:27,280 --> 01:16:29,487
Who you think you talkin' to?

1240
01:16:31,160 --> 01:16:34,403
You know you never could lie to me.
I'm your mother.

1241
01:16:36,040 --> 01:16:38,202
God's not pleased with this, daughter.

1242
01:16:41,640 --> 01:16:43,085
I knew when you moved here.

1243
01:16:43,200 --> 01:16:45,885
I knew the devil was gon' be after you.
I just knew it.

1244
01:16:46,600 --> 01:16:50,002
And look at you. You're fallen.

1245
01:16:51,080 --> 01:16:53,128
Look at you, you're changing.

1246
01:16:53,320 --> 01:16:55,846
Please, baby, come back.

1247
01:16:56,960 --> 01:16:59,645
Now, you know I taught you
the ways of the Lord.

1248
01:17:00,320 --> 01:17:01,731
You know better.

1249
01:17:02,160 --> 01:17:04,766
Come on out here, now. Come pray with me.

1250
01:17:04,840 --> 01:17:08,049
Okay, Mama. I'll come out there
and I'll pray with you.

1251
01:17:08,960 --> 01:17:10,200
But then what?

1252
01:17:11,360 --> 01:17:13,044
Am I supposed to stop wearing makeup?

1253
01:17:13,120 --> 01:17:14,929
And wear dresses down to my ankle,

1254
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:17,446
and pretend like I'm all holy and happy,

1255
01:17:17,520 --> 01:17:20,046
and sanctified for the Lord like you do?

1256
01:17:20,520 --> 01:17:22,409
Nobody's pretending, baby.

1257
01:17:22,800 --> 01:17:26,361
Yeah, well, I'm just saying
it don't take all that to love the Lord.

1258
01:17:27,600 --> 01:17:30,809
Why you so disrespectful to me?

1259
01:17:31,280 --> 01:17:34,250
I'm just saying what my father
shoulda told you long ago.

1260
01:17:37,560 --> 01:17:40,131
Now, you can just leave him right outta this.

1261
01:17:40,200 --> 01:17:41,884
God bless the dead.

1262
01:17:42,880 --> 01:17:44,405
God bless the dead?

1263
01:17:44,480 --> 01:17:46,687
So, Mama, we're still doing that act?

1264
01:17:47,040 --> 01:17:48,201
When you gon' quit it?

1265
01:17:48,320 --> 01:17:50,846
We both know he's still alive. Yeah.

1266
01:17:51,680 --> 01:17:54,650
I found him in Youngstown, Mama.

1267
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:56,570
And he told me all about you.

1268
01:17:56,960 --> 01:18:00,203
And how you left him
the second you joined that church.

1269
01:18:00,400 --> 01:18:01,890
How you kept him outta my life.

1270
01:18:01,960 --> 01:18:04,122
So what do you gotta lie about it for?

1271
01:18:04,240 --> 01:18:06,811
You trying to turn this all around on me.

1272
01:18:07,400 --> 01:18:09,926
But it's not about me. It's about you.

1273
01:18:10,880 --> 01:18:15,408
That fool out there,
'bout to make a bigger fool outta you.

1274
01:18:16,240 --> 01:18:19,767
That boy is gonna hurt you somethin' bad.

1275
01:18:20,440 --> 01:18:23,444
And he gon' take you straight to hell.

1276
01:18:24,480 --> 01:18:26,528
Well, I'll enjoy the ride.

1277
01:18:28,240 --> 01:18:30,242
Where you get that smart mouth from?

1278
01:18:31,080 --> 01:18:33,731
How dare you talk to me like that?

1279
01:18:34,560 --> 01:18:36,289
I done worked my fingers to the bone

1280
01:18:36,360 --> 01:18:38,169
to make sure you had a decent life.

1281
01:18:38,920 --> 01:18:40,922
I done cleaned more toilets
than you can think of

1282
01:18:41,080 --> 01:18:43,686
and then you would talk
to your mother like this?

1283
01:18:44,680 --> 01:18:45,886
Not today.

1284
01:18:46,760 --> 01:18:47,921
Not today!

1285
01:18:48,280 --> 01:18:49,361
What's going on?

1286
01:18:50,120 --> 01:18:51,770
Well, you know my mother.

1287
01:18:51,920 --> 01:18:56,562
She feels that the devil is after me,
so she in there hollerin'.

1288
01:18:56,640 --> 01:18:59,803
"Yea, though I walk through
the valley of the shadow of death,

1289
01:18:59,920 --> 01:19:01,684
"I will fear no evil.

1290
01:19:01,760 --> 01:19:05,082
"He maketh me to lie down
in green pastures."

1291
01:19:05,280 --> 01:19:07,726
Brice, I need you take care of my child.

1292
01:19:07,800 --> 01:19:09,848
I will, but tell me what's going on.

1293
01:19:10,200 --> 01:19:12,123
God, Lord, Jesus and the Host.

1294
01:19:12,200 --> 01:19:15,090
- Judith, what's going on?
- Please, not you, too.

1295
01:19:15,680 --> 01:19:19,162
Judith, I've never seen her or you
act like this. Talk to me.

1296
01:19:19,240 --> 01:19:23,404
Brice, okay, I just want to go take a shower.
It's really not that deep.

1297
01:19:23,480 --> 01:19:26,051
No, Judith, Judith, talk to me. Please.

1298
01:19:26,320 --> 01:19:28,926
Judith, talk to me. Judith!

1299
01:19:29,960 --> 01:19:30,961
Judith!

1300
01:19:34,440 --> 01:19:35,805
Please!

1301
01:23:00,280 --> 01:23:01,691
Wait a minute.

1302
01:23:02,360 --> 01:23:04,522
Those are not my hand-me-downs.

1303
01:23:04,680 --> 01:23:07,251
No, they are not. Take that for me.

1304
01:23:07,320 --> 01:23:09,448
Oh, my God. You caught on.

1305
01:23:09,520 --> 01:23:12,205
Wait a minute. Wait.
You caught on. Let me see.

1306
01:23:12,680 --> 01:23:15,206
- I am so proud.
- Like it? Yes?

1307
01:23:15,280 --> 01:23:17,726
This is my finest moment in life.

1308
01:23:17,800 --> 01:23:19,370
- Is Janice in?
- Yes.

1309
01:23:25,520 --> 01:23:26,567
Hi.

1310
01:23:27,600 --> 01:23:29,090
What, you don't knock?

1311
01:23:29,720 --> 01:23:31,961
Just the person I wanted to see. Have a seat.

1312
01:23:32,040 --> 01:23:33,041
No, I'll stand.

1313
01:23:35,480 --> 01:23:40,361
I wanted to thank you for the job,
but this will be my last week.

1314
01:23:43,120 --> 01:23:46,090
No. This is your last day.

1315
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:52,006
I just got a call from Harley,
telling me that he's out of the deal with me

1316
01:23:52,080 --> 01:23:55,368
and opening a practice for you.

1317
01:23:56,760 --> 01:23:58,171
That's what we plan to do.

1318
01:23:58,720 --> 01:23:59,767
We?

1319
01:24:04,080 --> 01:24:05,161
Little girl,

1320
01:24:05,840 --> 01:24:11,244
you have no idea what you are in for.

1321
01:24:13,080 --> 01:24:16,641
But I wish you all the best
with your struggle.

1322
01:24:23,680 --> 01:24:25,808
You know, I've been meaning to tell you,

1323
01:24:26,280 --> 01:24:29,284
you are in an existential identity crisis.

1324
01:24:29,440 --> 01:24:30,771
I did my research on you.

1325
01:24:31,040 --> 01:24:32,121
You spent those two weeks in Paris

1326
01:24:32,240 --> 01:24:34,083
and all of a sudden
you got a French accent?

1327
01:24:34,440 --> 01:24:36,329
Girl, we know you from Georgia.

1328
01:24:38,600 --> 01:24:41,285
Bitch, you better
get your ass outta my office.

1329
01:24:42,800 --> 01:24:43,881
Now!

1330
01:24:53,840 --> 01:24:54,887
That should do it.

1331
01:24:54,960 --> 01:24:56,803
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1332
01:25:00,640 --> 01:25:02,130
What's going on? You okay?

1333
01:25:04,280 --> 01:25:05,327
Yeah.

1334
01:25:06,640 --> 01:25:07,971
Why are you so quiet?

1335
01:25:10,560 --> 01:25:11,721
I'm sorry.

1336
01:25:13,360 --> 01:25:14,521
Brice, what's the matter?

1337
01:25:14,800 --> 01:25:16,006
Melinda, I'm fine.

1338
01:25:16,080 --> 01:25:18,651
No, you're not. Come on.

1339
01:25:19,440 --> 01:25:22,649
Everything you done for me here,
let me return the favor.

1340
01:25:25,920 --> 01:25:27,285
What's going on?

1341
01:25:29,200 --> 01:25:31,202
I think I lost my wife.

1342
01:25:34,320 --> 01:25:35,765
I'm sorry.

1343
01:25:36,440 --> 01:25:38,488
I'm so sorry. Are you sure?

1344
01:25:40,640 --> 01:25:42,642
I can't even believe it.

1345
01:25:44,320 --> 01:25:45,526
I don't know what I did wrong.

1346
01:25:45,600 --> 01:25:47,728
I didn't know it was that bad.
I just thought that...

1347
01:25:47,800 --> 01:25:50,770
Brice, sometimes we can
get comfortable with people.

1348
01:25:51,120 --> 01:25:53,441
And that's what causes the problems.

1349
01:25:54,360 --> 01:25:55,441
That's how it is.

1350
01:25:55,520 --> 01:25:57,363
But I didn't even know she was unhappy.

1351
01:25:57,520 --> 01:25:59,045
Well, she probably wasn't.

1352
01:25:59,400 --> 01:26:01,641
Most times you're happy
until somebody comes along

1353
01:26:01,760 --> 01:26:03,524
and shows you something different.

1354
01:26:04,040 --> 01:26:06,202
Maybe I did take her for granted.

1355
01:26:06,840 --> 01:26:10,049
Well, say you did. But this is wrong.

1356
01:26:11,160 --> 01:26:13,845
This is wrong of her, man.
You don't deserve this.

1357
01:26:14,560 --> 01:26:17,689
You can't take the responsibility
for what she did.

1358
01:26:18,160 --> 01:26:19,127
Because when people cheat...

1359
01:26:19,200 --> 01:26:20,770
I never said she was cheating.

1360
01:26:20,840 --> 01:26:22,046
She's cheating.

1361
01:26:23,280 --> 01:26:24,805
Miss Waco, I didn't...

1362
01:26:24,880 --> 01:26:27,884
Calm down! But the lesbian is right.

1363
01:26:29,280 --> 01:26:32,602
Lesbian? I'm not a lesbian.

1364
01:26:34,400 --> 01:26:35,481
You're not?

1365
01:26:35,760 --> 01:26:38,491
I'm sorry. I thought that you...

1366
01:26:38,560 --> 01:26:40,642
The boots and the sweater.

1367
01:26:42,120 --> 01:26:43,167
You know, she's met somebody

1368
01:26:43,240 --> 01:26:46,847
that's making her look at life differently.
Face it!

1369
01:26:48,160 --> 01:26:49,366
So what do I do?

1370
01:26:49,920 --> 01:26:53,003
If you see a mob fighting with bricks,

1371
01:26:53,080 --> 01:26:57,005
you don't join in the fight
unless you have one, too.

1372
01:26:58,640 --> 01:26:59,926
May I help you?

1373
01:27:01,760 --> 01:27:03,524
You have a prescription?

1374
01:27:28,720 --> 01:27:30,370
Hey, I wanna go home with you.

1375
01:27:50,920 --> 01:27:51,921
Judith!

1376
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:56,048
- Hey, Brice.
- Come on, let's go.

1377
01:27:57,160 --> 01:27:58,321
Go home.

1378
01:27:59,040 --> 01:28:01,486
Judith, let's go, now! Get up!

1379
01:28:01,720 --> 01:28:03,848
I don't think she wants to go with you.

1380
01:28:05,120 --> 01:28:06,770
Judith, let's go!

1381
01:28:07,760 --> 01:28:11,003
- Baby, I'm getting tired of this.
- Baby? Get up.

1382
01:28:11,680 --> 01:28:13,682
- Get up.
- Hey! Hey! Hey!

1383
01:28:15,400 --> 01:28:16,606
Get offa me.

1384
01:28:18,080 --> 01:28:20,082
Get your damn hands offa me!

1385
01:28:21,320 --> 01:28:22,560
Get offa me!

1386
01:28:25,800 --> 01:28:27,290
What is wrong with you?

1387
01:28:28,520 --> 01:28:29,851
Get your damn hands off of me!

1388
01:28:29,960 --> 01:28:31,200
Have you lost your mind?

1389
01:28:31,720 --> 01:28:32,846
Maybe.

1390
01:28:33,520 --> 01:28:36,808
I'm at home waiting on you.
And this is what you're doing?

1391
01:28:37,200 --> 01:28:39,168
Well, stop waiting, Brice.

1392
01:28:40,480 --> 01:28:41,925
This is how you do me?

1393
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:44,968
You're messing around with this clown.

1394
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:49,685
Baby, you don't know how much I love you.

1395
01:28:55,760 --> 01:28:57,205
Baby, come home.

1396
01:28:58,440 --> 01:29:00,010
If you come home,

1397
01:29:02,320 --> 01:29:04,243
I promise you I'll never mention it again.

1398
01:29:04,320 --> 01:29:05,560
Just come home, please.

1399
01:29:09,960 --> 01:29:11,246
Please.

1400
01:29:14,200 --> 01:29:15,884
Oh, you're such a good guy.

1401
01:29:18,360 --> 01:29:20,681
And I really hope you find a nice girl.

1402
01:29:23,280 --> 01:29:24,725
What are you saying to me?

1403
01:29:30,880 --> 01:29:33,201
I feel so dead with you, Brice.

1404
01:29:34,720 --> 01:29:35,926
I do.

1405
01:29:36,400 --> 01:29:39,131
And I wanna feel alive. I wanna feel wanted.

1406
01:29:39,200 --> 01:29:40,247
I don't.

1407
01:29:41,120 --> 01:29:44,761
You took me for granted. You did.

1408
01:29:46,600 --> 01:29:50,446
I don't just want a good guy.
I want a phenomenal guy.

1409
01:29:52,520 --> 01:29:54,204
You're not phenomenal.

1410
01:29:55,680 --> 01:29:58,604
What are you... What are you saying to me?

1411
01:30:03,600 --> 01:30:05,841
We have someone I can pay

1412
01:30:05,960 --> 01:30:08,406
to help you through this
and help counsel you.

1413
01:30:09,400 --> 01:30:10,481
What?

1414
01:30:14,440 --> 01:30:16,442
Judith, you're not saying this to me.

1415
01:30:20,280 --> 01:30:22,009
I tried. I loved you.

1416
01:30:23,400 --> 01:30:24,925
I wanted to love you.

1417
01:30:25,480 --> 01:30:27,403
And I'm sorry if I failed.

1418
01:30:29,280 --> 01:30:30,645
I'm sorry.

1419
01:30:34,400 --> 01:30:35,640
Fine.

1420
01:30:37,640 --> 01:30:39,802
I will help you pack your shit.

1421
01:30:44,120 --> 01:30:47,203
I don't need anything. I'll just get my laptop.

1422
01:30:48,640 --> 01:30:50,608
I have everything I need,

1423
01:30:51,160 --> 01:30:53,367
everything I could ask for here.

1424
01:30:56,480 --> 01:30:57,720
Bye.

1425
01:31:48,200 --> 01:31:49,201
Here you go.

1426
01:31:53,200 --> 01:31:54,725
How are you doing? You okay?

1427
01:32:03,400 --> 01:32:04,401
No.

1428
01:32:05,760 --> 01:32:07,603
I understand what you're going through.

1429
01:32:09,640 --> 01:32:12,086
She was just so cold.

1430
01:32:15,240 --> 01:32:16,969
She wasn't herself.

1431
01:32:20,760 --> 01:32:22,728
Her mother warned me. She was right.

1432
01:32:23,360 --> 01:32:25,283
Brice, I'm so sorry.

1433
01:32:27,600 --> 01:32:28,840
I know this pain.

1434
01:32:35,680 --> 01:32:36,886
What are you doing?

1435
01:32:37,360 --> 01:32:39,601
We're not attracted to each other.

1436
01:32:40,200 --> 01:32:41,929
Okay, you're just hurting
and you'll do anything

1437
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:43,331
to make the pain go away.

1438
01:32:43,400 --> 01:32:45,721
Trust me. I've been there.

1439
01:32:47,760 --> 01:32:49,000
I'm sorry.

1440
01:32:49,880 --> 01:32:51,962
I know it hurts right now.

1441
01:32:52,640 --> 01:32:55,246
And I'm not gon' lie to you,
it's gon' hurt for a long time,

1442
01:32:55,360 --> 01:32:57,442
and it's gon' seem like it's forever.

1443
01:32:59,760 --> 01:33:02,445
But you're gonna get through this.
I promise.

1444
01:33:05,440 --> 01:33:08,922
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1445
01:33:21,440 --> 01:33:22,487
You coming up?

1446
01:33:22,960 --> 01:33:24,883
Hell, yeah, I'm comin' up.

1447
01:33:24,960 --> 01:33:27,088
I wanna see how this dude has you livin'.

1448
01:33:27,160 --> 01:33:29,640
Well, he should be at work,
so he's not home.

1449
01:33:31,520 --> 01:33:33,090
Hey, move it! You're blocking the road!

1450
01:33:33,160 --> 01:33:34,207
Go around.

1451
01:33:54,160 --> 01:33:57,050
Thank you, Jesus. Thank you, Lord.

1452
01:33:57,960 --> 01:33:59,769
Oh, my Jesus.

1453
01:34:00,320 --> 01:34:01,526
We have to go.

1454
01:34:01,600 --> 01:34:02,840
Forgive us our sins.

1455
01:34:03,240 --> 01:34:05,811
Lead all souls to you, Lord.

1456
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:09,721
Especially those in most need
of Thy Divine Mercy, Lord.

1457
01:34:10,360 --> 01:34:13,091
No, no. Let's have a little fun with this.

1458
01:34:13,720 --> 01:34:14,767
Hello, Reverend.

1459
01:34:14,840 --> 01:34:15,921
Save my child!

1460
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:17,411
Sisters.

1461
01:34:25,920 --> 01:34:28,400
Oh, the Lord done answered
my prayers, sisters.

1462
01:34:28,480 --> 01:34:30,448
- My child is home.
- I'm getting my computer.

1463
01:34:30,560 --> 01:34:35,009
Sweet baby, please stay.
Please stay. You're not safe.

1464
01:34:35,120 --> 01:34:37,691
I brought all the sisters here to pray for you.

1465
01:34:37,840 --> 01:34:40,002
- We need you to stay here.
- I'm fine, Mama.

1466
01:34:40,360 --> 01:34:41,771
I know you think you are,
but you're not, darling.

1467
01:34:41,840 --> 01:34:45,208
- Okay. We gon' go. All right? I love you.
- You're in danger.

1468
01:34:45,280 --> 01:34:46,281
Let's go.

1469
01:34:46,400 --> 01:34:48,528
- No, sweetie.
- Mom, give me this.

1470
01:34:48,720 --> 01:34:49,687
I need it

1471
01:34:49,760 --> 01:34:50,807
Please, stay here. I'm begging you.

1472
01:34:50,880 --> 01:34:52,723
- There's something on this.
- Mama, we need to get...

1473
01:34:52,800 --> 01:34:54,643
- Stop it!
- Damn!

1474
01:34:55,160 --> 01:34:56,241
Satan!

1475
01:34:58,920 --> 01:35:00,410
Give me that now.

1476
01:35:00,960 --> 01:35:05,204
What the hell? Mama, you okay? You okay?

1477
01:35:05,280 --> 01:35:07,681
- You're good, right? Stand up.
- My sweet baby!

1478
01:35:07,760 --> 01:35:09,046
Now you see what I mean?

1479
01:35:09,120 --> 01:35:10,451
No, he didn't mean it. He didn't mean it.

1480
01:35:10,520 --> 01:35:12,249
You need to stay here with me, baby, please.

1481
01:35:12,320 --> 01:35:14,721
- Get up. Get up!
- Get your hands off my baby!

1482
01:35:14,800 --> 01:35:16,484
- I'm talking to her!
- Mama, hold on now.

1483
01:35:16,600 --> 01:35:18,728
Get up. Girl, get up.

1484
01:35:19,080 --> 01:35:23,005
Sister Sarah, you tried. You tried.

1485
01:35:23,320 --> 01:35:26,563
I don't know if she's hurt.
I don't know if her bruised knee is okay.

1486
01:35:26,640 --> 01:35:28,529
I don't know nothin' because
you just jacked me outta there!

1487
01:35:28,600 --> 01:35:31,365
Bring your ass back here. Come back here.
You come back.

1488
01:35:31,440 --> 01:35:33,010
Get the hell off me! Don't you touch me!

1489
01:35:33,120 --> 01:35:36,442
- Whose side are you on?
- She's my mother, you jerk!

1490
01:35:36,640 --> 01:35:38,642
I don't give a damn
about your mama, Judith!

1491
01:35:38,720 --> 01:35:40,484
Yeah, obviously, you don't!

1492
01:35:41,120 --> 01:35:42,610
The way you pushed her down!

1493
01:35:43,280 --> 01:35:44,805
- Get up the stairs!
- Don't touch me!

1494
01:35:44,880 --> 01:35:46,928
Get up the stairs if I wanna get up the stairs.

1495
01:35:47,600 --> 01:35:49,921
So you just gon'
take her side like that? Huh?

1496
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:51,240
- Take her side?
- Yeah!

1497
01:35:51,320 --> 01:35:53,288
This is not about me taking her side, Harley.

1498
01:35:53,360 --> 01:35:55,931
It's the fact that you will not understand
what it feels like

1499
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:58,321
to watch your mother thrown to the ground!

1500
01:35:58,840 --> 01:36:00,888
Look, just because your mother
abandoned you in some crack house,

1501
01:36:00,960 --> 01:36:02,724
don't mean you gotta abuse mine!

1502
01:36:05,120 --> 01:36:08,010
I don't give a damn what she did.

1503
01:36:08,280 --> 01:36:10,328
It ain't about what she did.

1504
01:36:11,520 --> 01:36:13,522
Shoot, yes, she annoys me, too.
She's still my mother.

1505
01:36:13,600 --> 01:36:15,090
Where is my shit, bitch?

1506
01:36:15,160 --> 01:36:16,844
She don't deserve to be treated that way.

1507
01:36:20,160 --> 01:36:23,482
Judith, you know that I'm just
crazy in love with you, okay?

1508
01:36:23,600 --> 01:36:24,840
And it just...

1509
01:36:25,280 --> 01:36:27,806
lt just makes me really upset
when you're not on my side, okay?

1510
01:36:27,880 --> 01:36:30,167
I'm gonna just give you some space
right now.

1511
01:36:31,200 --> 01:36:32,326
You leaving?

1512
01:36:36,200 --> 01:36:37,326
Judith?

1513
01:36:38,360 --> 01:36:40,567
It's just, this really is not healthy.

1514
01:36:41,320 --> 01:36:43,243
You gon' leave me?
Is that what you gonna do?

1515
01:36:43,320 --> 01:36:45,846
- What the hell are you...
- Is that what you gon' do?

1516
01:36:46,160 --> 01:36:47,605
What do you know about cooking?

1517
01:36:47,680 --> 01:36:49,444
Boy, this is what I do.

1518
01:36:55,880 --> 01:36:56,881
Thank you.

1519
01:36:57,960 --> 01:36:59,371
Don't mention it.

1520
01:36:59,560 --> 01:37:01,688
I didn't want yo' ass to jump.

1521
01:37:02,680 --> 01:37:04,045
I'm not gonna jump.

1522
01:37:04,200 --> 01:37:05,247
Good.

1523
01:37:07,560 --> 01:37:09,483
It hurts like hell, though.

1524
01:37:10,200 --> 01:37:11,531
I know.

1525
01:37:12,240 --> 01:37:13,765
I know where you are.

1526
01:37:14,240 --> 01:37:16,481
You can cook. You're a good woman.

1527
01:37:17,880 --> 01:37:19,848
You think you'll ever find love again?

1528
01:37:22,320 --> 01:37:24,402
You can't run from that guy forever.

1529
01:37:25,200 --> 01:37:27,407
I believe in love and marriage

1530
01:37:28,520 --> 01:37:30,682
and I really hope you find a nice guy.

1531
01:37:38,200 --> 01:37:39,440
Brice...

1532
01:37:40,720 --> 01:37:42,245
I have HIV.

1533
01:37:56,880 --> 01:37:58,928
- Melinda, I'm sorry.
-It's okay.

1534
01:37:59,880 --> 01:38:01,450
I'm dealing with it.

1535
01:38:02,600 --> 01:38:04,364
I made the choice to be with my ex.

1536
01:38:04,920 --> 01:38:07,400
Even though
I knew he was sleeping around,

1537
01:38:08,040 --> 01:38:10,042
so I accepted my part in it.

1538
01:38:11,120 --> 01:38:13,361
I'm taking my meds, so I'm doing good.

1539
01:38:17,120 --> 01:38:18,724
But to answer your question...

1540
01:38:19,440 --> 01:38:22,649
No. I'm not running from Harley anymore.

1541
01:38:25,600 --> 01:38:26,806
Harley?

1542
01:38:26,920 --> 01:38:28,729
Yeah, the Class-Meet guy.

1543
01:38:34,160 --> 01:38:35,321
- What's wrong?
- Judith.

1544
01:38:35,400 --> 01:38:37,880
- What? What's the matter?
- Judith!

1545
01:38:37,960 --> 01:38:40,088
- Judith!
- Judith? What about Judith?

1546
01:38:40,160 --> 01:38:43,448
- My wife is with him!
- Okay, okay. Oh, my God.

1547
01:39:19,360 --> 01:39:20,521
Judith!

1548
01:39:23,160 --> 01:39:24,286
Judith!

1549
01:39:45,640 --> 01:39:46,846
No. No, no, no, no.

1550
01:39:47,360 --> 01:39:50,728
Judith, baby, it's me. It's Brice.

1551
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:52,286
No, no, no, it's me.

1552
01:39:53,400 --> 01:39:55,528
I'm gonna take you home.
I'm taking you home.

1553
01:39:55,840 --> 01:39:57,080
It's me, baby.

1554
01:39:59,080 --> 01:40:00,206
Brice!

1555
01:40:00,720 --> 01:40:02,643
- Yeah.
- I knew you'd come.

1556
01:40:02,920 --> 01:40:04,251
He did this to you?

1557
01:40:05,360 --> 01:40:06,600
I deserve it.

1558
01:40:06,840 --> 01:40:07,921
You don't deserve this.

1559
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:10,002
- Yes, I do.
- No, you don't.

1560
01:40:11,040 --> 01:40:13,088
I was so mean to you.

1561
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:16,764
I'm so sorry.

1562
01:40:17,760 --> 01:40:19,524
I'm so sorry.

1563
01:40:19,920 --> 01:40:22,810
You think we can fix it? We can fix it, right?

1564
01:40:23,400 --> 01:40:25,129
We'll fix it.

1565
01:40:26,240 --> 01:40:27,366
Okay.

1566
01:40:28,680 --> 01:40:30,489
Where are you hurt?

1567
01:40:33,280 --> 01:40:34,520
Right here.

1568
01:40:39,080 --> 01:40:40,570
I hurt your heart.

1569
01:40:48,600 --> 01:40:49,601

Come here, girl.

Don't you ever come near her
or my wife again.

01:42:53,880 --> 01:42:55,291
What happened to Judith?

1591
01:43:02,040 --> 01:43:03,041
Well...

1592
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:05,411
She's alive.

1593
01:43:06,400 --> 01:43:08,050
How does this story end?

1594
01:43:08,760 --> 01:43:10,205
It's still being written.

1595
01:43:13,680 --> 01:43:15,364
Did she get HIV, too?

1596
01:43:20,280 --> 01:43:21,361
Yes.

1597
01:43:22,400 --> 01:43:23,526

I'm good. I spoke to your doctor.

1611
01:44:30,120 --> 01:44:32,600
He changed your dosage
to get your T-cell count up.

Okay.

Where you headed to?

01:44:39,600 --> 01:44:42,604
I'm going to church.
Mama's there waiting for me.

1617
01:44:42,960 --> 01:44:44,883
Okay. Well, be careful.

1618
01:44:46,160 --> 01:44:48,811

I'm here for you, Judith.
