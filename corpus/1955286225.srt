1
00:00:29,638 --> 00:00:32,290
Redfield County 911.
What is your emergency?

2
00:00:33,859 --> 00:00:35,794
Ma'am? Ma'am?

3
00:00:35,894 --> 00:00:38,839
Please calm down, ma'am.
What is your current address?

4
00:00:38,939 --> 00:00:41,758
It's the big house.
It's the big house on Deerfield Lane.

5
00:00:41,858 --> 00:00:45,679
Ma'am? Ma'am? Is anyone else injured?

6
00:00:45,779 --> 00:00:47,306
Oh, my God.

7
00:00:47,406 --> 00:00:48,932
Oh, my God, there's blood everywhere.
Please send someone.

8
00:00:49,032 --> 00:00:51,101
Ma'am, we have paramedics
on the way to you now.

9
00:00:51,201 --> 00:00:53,603
They can't be dead. They can't be dead.

10
00:00:53,703 --> 00:00:56,106
- Please send someone right now.
- Stay calm. Don't worry.

11
00:00:56,206 --> 00:00:58,567
- You're gonna be fine.
- Oh, my God.

12
00:00:58,667 --> 00:01:03,280
Everything is gonna be fine.
Okay? Stay with me.

13
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:05,824
Please, I'm so scared.
Please, please send...

14
00:01:05,924 --> 00:01:08,184
Everything's gonna be fine.

15
00:01:24,609 --> 00:01:28,221
# God rest ye merry, gentlemen ##

16
00:01:28,321 --> 00:01:30,015
18 points, bitches.

17
00:01:30,115 --> 00:01:34,061
Ugh! What a disgusting waste
of a triple word.

18
00:01:34,161 --> 00:01:38,607
Whatever. I should get, like, extra points
'cause it has to do with the holiday.

19
00:01:38,707 --> 00:01:42,152
What does that have to do with Christmas?

20
00:01:42,252 --> 00:01:43,987
Christmas is about Jesus.

21
00:01:44,087 --> 00:01:45,614
Satin is the opposite of Jesus.

22
00:01:45,714 --> 00:01:49,743
So, I don't know, maybe it's not, like,
super relevant, but it's still religious.

23
00:01:49,843 --> 00:01:55,457
- Oh, no, no, no.
- My God, you can't be serious.

24
00:01:55,557 --> 00:01:57,000
- What?
- I can't.

25
00:01:57,100 --> 00:02:00,003
- I can't... I can't even...
- What?

26
00:02:00,103 --> 00:02:03,256
That's satin, you retard.

27
00:02:03,356 --> 00:02:07,511
- Satan is with an "A."
- Well, whatever. It's satin then.

28
00:02:07,611 --> 00:02:09,972
Yeah. Mm...

29
00:02:10,072 --> 00:02:12,557
I don't know. I don't think
that should count for you.

30
00:02:12,657 --> 00:02:15,060
Fuck off. You have, like, 30,000 points.

31
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:17,688
I don't know if you
should get those points.

32
00:02:17,788 --> 00:02:19,873
Josh, please mediate.

33
00:02:21,374 --> 00:02:22,734
Uh, I don't know.

34
00:02:22,834 --> 00:02:24,736
Come on, Josh. I need you.

35
00:02:24,836 --> 00:02:27,322
Yeah, sure. She should get the points.

36
00:02:27,422 --> 00:02:29,866
Whatever. He doesn't know.
He's over there looking at porn.

37
00:02:29,966 --> 00:02:32,369
Okay, ladies, this is the last of it.

38
00:02:32,469 --> 00:02:35,080
- Why don't you polish it off?
- Dad, we're stuffed.

39
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:37,374
You know what, I'm providing lodging.

40
00:02:37,474 --> 00:02:39,918
Think of this as rent. Eat.

41
00:02:40,018 --> 00:02:43,630
Mr. Greenberg, I swear, if I eat anything
else, I'm gonna puke all over your carpet.

42
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:47,175
All right, you know what, I'll keep it there
just in case you get the munchies later.

43
00:02:47,275 --> 00:02:50,137
Oh, Holly, can you talk to your dad?

44
00:02:50,237 --> 00:02:53,307
I was thinking maybe the two
of us were gonna play golf soon.

45
00:02:53,407 --> 00:02:57,185
Oh, yeah. He did... Yeah, he was...
He wants to do that, for sure.

46
00:02:57,285 --> 00:03:00,355
There's, uh, you know, the election,

47
00:03:00,455 --> 00:03:02,983
and it's just... he's so busy.

48
00:03:03,083 --> 00:03:05,527
Busy. He's busy. Sure, I understand.

49
00:03:05,627 --> 00:03:08,905
Dad, he doesn't want
to be your friend. Get over it.

50
00:03:09,005 --> 00:03:10,699
Come on, who doesn't want to be my friend?

51
00:03:10,799 --> 00:03:13,118
Yeah, you're awesome, Mr. G.
Don't you listen to that shit.

52
00:03:13,218 --> 00:03:14,453
Thank you, Cali.

53
00:03:14,553 --> 00:03:16,246
And listen, you know, tell your dad

54
00:03:16,346 --> 00:03:19,291
he's making a big mistake
with that Patterson-McCarthy bill.

55
00:03:19,391 --> 00:03:22,878
I mean, if he wants to drive
all the banking business out of...

56
00:03:22,978 --> 00:03:25,547
Dad, please leave.

57
00:03:25,647 --> 00:03:27,841
- Okay, okay, I'm done.
- Ooh.

58
00:03:27,941 --> 00:03:29,593
Oh, hey, Mr. Greenberg,
you want in on this game?

59
00:03:29,693 --> 00:03:32,512
You know, I'd love to, but Jeannie
had a little too much eggnog before.

60
00:03:32,612 --> 00:03:35,307
I got to watch her. Next thing you know,
she's gonna be knocking over a lamp.

61
00:03:35,407 --> 00:03:37,434
Well, maybe you'll get lucky tonight.

62
00:03:37,534 --> 00:03:39,561
Fingers crossed.

63
00:03:39,661 --> 00:03:41,732
Good night, ladies.

64
00:03:42,331 --> 00:03:44,147
Whatever.

65
00:03:46,042 --> 00:03:47,878
Okay, I'm tired of this shit.

66
00:03:49,045 --> 00:03:51,448
Let's, uh... Let's smoke.

67
00:03:51,748 --> 00:03:53,250
Come on.

68
00:03:58,096 --> 00:04:00,540
- What are you doing?
- Is it cool if I come?

69
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,125
No, Josh, absolutely not.

70
00:04:02,225 --> 00:04:04,478
These are drugs, Josh.
You don't want drugs.

71
00:04:06,813 --> 00:04:10,150
Josh, you get back inside now.
You get. Get. No.

72
00:04:12,903 --> 00:04:16,723
# From God our Heavenly Father #

73
00:04:16,823 --> 00:04:20,435
# A blessed angel came #

74
00:04:20,535 --> 00:04:24,581
# And unto certain shepherds ##

75
00:04:29,086 --> 00:04:30,788
What kind of weed is this?

76
00:04:30,888 --> 00:04:33,999
What kind of weed is this?
What kind of question is that?

77
00:04:34,099 --> 00:04:36,093
What are you, some kind
of weed connoisseur now?

78
00:04:36,193 --> 00:04:39,679
- You know all types of weed?
- Be nice, Mel.

79
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:45,919
I needed this so bad.

80
00:04:46,019 --> 00:04:49,673
I'm, like, so full.
I feel like I'm gonna burst.

81
00:04:56,613 --> 00:04:59,182
- Hey. What's up?
- Nothing really.

82
00:04:59,282 --> 00:05:02,019
I'm just watching TV.
You ladies staying out of trouble?

83
00:05:02,119 --> 00:05:05,439
Oh, yeah, you know us, just
wrapping presents for the orphans.

84
00:05:05,539 --> 00:05:07,399
Well, yeah, I figured.

85
00:05:07,499 --> 00:05:09,592
What else would you be doing?

86
00:05:13,213 --> 00:05:14,823
Mel's family is so funny.

87
00:05:14,923 --> 00:05:18,118
They're Jewish, but they like Christmas
more than anyone I know.

88
00:05:18,218 --> 00:05:21,913
Well, yeah, Christmas is fucking awesome.

89
00:05:22,013 --> 00:05:23,999
But what are you guys actually doing?

90
00:05:24,099 --> 00:05:25,834
- We smoked a little.
- Nice.

91
00:05:25,934 --> 00:05:28,629
Probably gonna watch some TV, go to bed.

92
00:05:28,729 --> 00:05:32,023
I might have one more slice of pie
before that, though.

93
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:35,402
I miss you.

94
00:05:36,111 --> 00:05:38,388
Yeah, I miss you too.

95
00:05:38,488 --> 00:05:43,226
So, Josh gosh b'gosh,
what's the lady situation?

96
00:05:43,326 --> 00:05:45,020
You pimping all over the world?

97
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,564
You got your hos in different area codes?

98
00:05:47,664 --> 00:05:50,192
Yeah, I'm talking to a couple girls.

99
00:05:50,292 --> 00:05:52,194
What? Are you serious?

100
00:05:52,294 --> 00:05:53,737
Are you having sex with any of them?

101
00:05:53,837 --> 00:05:57,616
Oh, my God, Cali, you're like
a fucking level seven sex offender

102
00:05:57,716 --> 00:06:01,662
that needs to be locked away in a cage,
far away from young boys.

103
00:06:01,762 --> 00:06:03,914
Melissa, do you think I want to
really fuck your little brother?

104
00:06:04,014 --> 00:06:05,749
Like, that could never happen.

105
00:06:05,849 --> 00:06:09,436
Hey, Josh, what would you do
if I asked you to fuck me right now?

106
00:06:11,354 --> 00:06:13,440
See? He'd, like, die.

107
00:06:14,274 --> 00:06:16,843
Uh-huh, just as I thought.

108
00:06:16,943 --> 00:06:19,429
- It was him, wasn't it?
- Who?

109
00:06:19,529 --> 00:06:21,598
Don't play dumb with me, you slut.

110
00:06:21,698 --> 00:06:24,142
Well, it's none of your business,
but yeah, it was Ben.

111
00:06:24,242 --> 00:06:26,536
Mm, Ben. It was Ben.

112
00:06:27,204 --> 00:06:28,605
Fucking Ben.

113
00:06:28,705 --> 00:06:30,440
What, did he read you poetry again?

114
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:34,695
What... What are you girls doing awake?
What are you doing?

115
00:06:34,795 --> 00:06:36,989
Are you girls smoking pot
with your little brother?

116
00:06:37,089 --> 00:06:38,740
- Mom.
- You're smoking weed?

117
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:41,493
You're smoking weed
with your little brother.

118
00:06:41,593 --> 00:06:45,289
What are you girls...
No, you girls can't smoke...

119
00:06:45,389 --> 00:06:47,165
You look so beautiful tonight.

120
00:06:47,265 --> 00:06:49,017
- Oh, my gosh.
- Melissa...

121
00:06:50,685 --> 00:06:52,612
Yes.

122
00:06:52,712 --> 00:06:54,506
I wish you were my mother.

123
00:06:54,606 --> 00:06:57,134
- Go to bed!
- We are going to bed.

124
00:06:57,234 --> 00:06:58,777
- Now!
- We love you.

125
00:07:08,912 --> 00:07:10,414
Are you guys hungry?

126
00:07:14,167 --> 00:07:17,029
# My mind is telling me no #

127
00:07:17,129 --> 00:07:23,076
# But my body,
my body is telling me yes ##

128
00:07:25,178 --> 00:07:27,789
Mmm, it's so good.

129
00:07:27,889 --> 00:07:31,335
Okay, that's it.
I can't eat anymore. I'll die.

130
00:07:31,435 --> 00:07:32,919
- I'm going to bed.
- No, it's so early.

131
00:07:33,019 --> 00:07:35,188
I don't care how tired you are.
You're not going to bed.

132
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:39,526
Here, have a pigs in a blanket.

133
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:44,181
It's infused with energy and vitamins.

134
00:07:44,281 --> 00:07:46,616
No, I'm, like, already
falling asleep right here.

135
00:07:47,784 --> 00:07:50,520
Guys, this is pathetic.

136
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:53,690
We are not old people. We are not old.

137
00:07:53,790 --> 00:07:56,543
We should not be eating ourselves
to sleep on a Friday night.

138
00:07:57,627 --> 00:08:01,490
But... I don't really want to get up.
And, like, it's so cold outside.

139
00:08:01,590 --> 00:08:04,368
And if we go out now, it's gonna
be so late when we get back.

140
00:08:04,468 --> 00:08:06,536
That is the most boring string of words
you've ever put together.

141
00:08:06,636 --> 00:08:09,498
Guys, we are young.
We should be living our lives.

142
00:08:09,598 --> 00:08:11,875
We've got at least ten more years

143
00:08:11,975 --> 00:08:16,213
before we've got to start caring about
our jobs, getting married, getting cats.

144
00:08:16,313 --> 00:08:20,759
Come on, let's not go to sleep
at 9:30 on a Friday night.

145
00:08:22,194 --> 00:08:24,221
We're going out. Mel, put down the food.

146
00:08:24,321 --> 00:08:26,974
- But it's so good.
- No. Put it down... food.

147
00:08:27,074 --> 00:08:30,060
Where would we even want to go?
Nothing is open for the holidays.

148
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,645
Are there any bars open?

149
00:08:31,745 --> 00:08:32,980
I have something in mind.

150
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:35,983
I'm a great big fat person now.

151
00:08:37,334 --> 00:08:38,902
Wait, guys, are we seriously...

152
00:08:39,002 --> 00:08:41,713
Get your ass in the car, bitch.
I ain't telling you again.

153
00:08:52,182 --> 00:08:54,876
I'm telling you guys,
this place is fucking sick.

154
00:08:54,976 --> 00:08:56,920
You're sure your uncle doesn't care?

155
00:08:57,020 --> 00:08:58,463
Oh, yeah. No, he's totally cool.

156
00:08:58,563 --> 00:09:01,008
He loves me.
This isn't a big deal, I promise.

157
00:09:01,108 --> 00:09:03,385
Well, how much further?
Because I have to pee.

158
00:09:03,485 --> 00:09:05,554
We're close.

159
00:09:05,654 --> 00:09:07,973
How weird. Someone's calling Holly.

160
00:09:08,073 --> 00:09:10,434
What the hell?

161
00:09:10,534 --> 00:09:14,479
- Who could that possibly be?
- Hello? Hey.

162
00:09:14,579 --> 00:09:18,608
No, yeah, actually, I'm going
to Cali's uncle's house now.

163
00:09:18,708 --> 00:09:20,193
It's supposed to be this big mansion.

164
00:09:20,293 --> 00:09:25,032
And I guess no one's home,
so I think we're gonna, like, crash there.

165
00:09:25,132 --> 00:09:26,925
What if I came over there?

166
00:09:28,552 --> 00:09:30,637
Yeah, let me... let me ask.

167
00:09:32,806 --> 00:09:34,808
- Are you serious?
- Can he?

168
00:09:36,935 --> 00:09:39,796
Yeah, I guess that's fine.

169
00:09:39,896 --> 00:09:42,341
Yeah, it's cool.
I'll text you the address.

170
00:09:42,441 --> 00:09:43,717
Okay.

171
00:09:43,817 --> 00:09:46,695
- Okay, see you then. Bye.
- Adios.

172
00:09:47,487 --> 00:09:49,431
- Holly!
- What?

173
00:09:49,531 --> 00:09:52,351
- Dude, you can't fucking do that.
- Why? What's the big deal?

174
00:09:52,451 --> 00:09:54,645
You just invited a guy
to our girls' night.

175
00:09:54,745 --> 00:09:56,855
- I asked.
- What am I supposed to say, no?

176
00:09:56,955 --> 00:09:59,149
- He's right there on the phone.
- Okay, what do you want me to do?

177
00:09:59,249 --> 00:10:01,401
You want me to call him
and tell him he can't come?

178
00:10:01,501 --> 00:10:04,321
No, absolutely not 'cause
then I'll look like a huge fucking bitch.

179
00:10:04,421 --> 00:10:05,922
Okay, then what?

180
00:10:07,799 --> 00:10:11,703
Let's just forget it.
Whatever, you don't understand.

181
00:10:11,803 --> 00:10:15,290
Whatever, it's fine.
Let's just have a good time.

182
00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:16,541
Geez, I'm sorry.

183
00:10:16,641 --> 00:10:20,128
I just wish that maybe you
would've thought...

184
00:10:20,228 --> 00:10:21,797
What is that?

185
00:10:21,897 --> 00:10:24,174
- What is that?
- Holy shit.

186
00:10:24,274 --> 00:10:26,068
Should we, like, help him?

187
00:10:29,654 --> 00:10:31,181
No, someone else will come by.

188
00:10:31,281 --> 00:10:32,933
- I'm just gonna say hi.
- Cali, I'm serious.

189
00:10:33,033 --> 00:10:36,203
- What if he's cute?
- Oh, shut up. Just keep going.

190
00:10:40,082 --> 00:10:41,833
No, Cali, go!

191
00:10:49,132 --> 00:10:53,035
# Like a Kennedy, Kennedy #

192
00:10:53,586 --> 00:10:55,289
Freak out much?

193
00:10:55,389 --> 00:10:57,416
I'm sorry. I just got scared.

194
00:10:57,516 --> 00:10:59,876
Well, yeah. She's right though.
I mean, what were you doing?

195
00:10:59,976 --> 00:11:02,379
There was a guy
who looked like he needed help.

196
00:11:02,479 --> 00:11:04,089
I was stopping to help the guy.

197
00:11:04,189 --> 00:11:06,883
Oh, and what are you gonna do,
change his tire?

198
00:11:06,983 --> 00:11:09,386
What are you so afraid of?

199
00:11:09,486 --> 00:11:11,596
Oh, I don't know, maybe brutal murder.

200
00:11:11,696 --> 00:11:15,183
Oh, my God. You guys
are such fucking pussies.

201
00:11:15,283 --> 00:11:17,269
Oh, God. Oh, I'm so sorry.

202
00:11:17,369 --> 00:11:19,438
I'm sorry we didn't want
to pick up a creepy beard man

203
00:11:19,538 --> 00:11:21,398
and, you know, drive him home.

204
00:11:21,498 --> 00:11:24,067
And what if that creepy beard man
is my future husband,

205
00:11:24,167 --> 00:11:26,169
and I will never see him again
because of you?

206
00:11:26,962 --> 00:11:27,963
Ew.

207
00:11:28,714 --> 00:11:30,507
You ready for this, guys?

208
00:11:31,174 --> 00:11:33,535
- Oh, my God.
- Wow.

209
00:11:33,635 --> 00:11:35,287
Oh. What the fuck?

210
00:11:35,387 --> 00:11:36,538
Yeah.

211
00:11:36,638 --> 00:11:38,461
What?

212
00:11:39,599 --> 00:11:41,209
- I know.
- Yeah, right?

213
00:11:41,309 --> 00:11:44,771
And I'm in the will
so be nice to me, bitches.

214
00:11:46,481 --> 00:11:48,233
Wow.

215
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:52,863
Oh, wow. This is insane.

216
00:12:02,038 --> 00:12:03,940
Party time.

217
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:06,401
Thank you, Cali, for dropping me off

218
00:12:06,501 --> 00:12:08,946
- on this lovely ice over here.
- You're welcome!

219
00:12:09,046 --> 00:12:10,572
Are you sure they're not home?

220
00:12:10,672 --> 00:12:12,282
I mean, all their cars are here.

221
00:12:12,382 --> 00:12:14,117
Oh, yeah. They have, like, 40 cars.

222
00:12:14,217 --> 00:12:17,829
Those are just the beaters they take out
when they want to look like poor people.

223
00:12:17,929 --> 00:12:19,222
Oh.

224
00:12:25,896 --> 00:12:27,839
Huh. That's weird.

225
00:12:27,939 --> 00:12:30,008
He usually leaves a spare.

226
00:12:30,108 --> 00:12:32,886
Well, why don't you just call him?

227
00:12:32,986 --> 00:12:35,263
Maybe he left it somewhere new.

228
00:12:35,363 --> 00:12:38,658
No, I don't really
want to bother him, you know?

229
00:12:41,203 --> 00:12:42,329
Ah.

230
00:12:47,751 --> 00:12:49,736
Nice.

231
00:12:52,089 --> 00:12:53,715
All right.

232
00:13:07,813 --> 00:13:10,340
Oh, my God.

233
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:12,734
Pretty classy, right?

234
00:13:15,946 --> 00:13:20,784
Uh, the Scrabble, it followed us.

235
00:13:24,037 --> 00:13:26,982
Wow. This is unbelievable.

236
00:13:27,082 --> 00:13:30,110
Well, just you guys wait.

237
00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:32,087
You ain't seen shit.

238
00:13:36,007 --> 00:13:37,968
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

239
00:13:39,469 --> 00:13:41,204
Boom. Mm.

240
00:13:41,304 --> 00:13:43,081
Holy fuck.

241
00:13:44,808 --> 00:13:46,376
What does your uncle do?

242
00:13:46,476 --> 00:13:50,589
I think he's, like,
a hedge fund person or something.

243
00:13:50,689 --> 00:13:52,674
What is a hedge fund?

244
00:13:52,774 --> 00:13:54,426
I don't know, but I want one.

245
00:13:54,526 --> 00:13:57,429
Have you ever driven one of these?

246
00:13:57,529 --> 00:14:00,098
What, are you kidding?
I've, like, driven all of them.

247
00:14:00,198 --> 00:14:02,159
What was it like?

248
00:14:03,994 --> 00:14:06,355
Sexual.

249
00:14:06,455 --> 00:14:10,734
You hit the gas,
and it goes so fast so quickly

250
00:14:10,834 --> 00:14:14,237
that your body's pushed up
against the seat,

251
00:14:14,337 --> 00:14:16,490
and everything
you have squishes backwards.

252
00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:21,178
And then the whole thing starts
to vibrate, and you're just, like, flying.

253
00:14:23,013 --> 00:14:24,765
I need that.

254
00:14:27,309 --> 00:14:29,503
You guys want to go for a ride?

255
00:14:29,603 --> 00:14:32,089
Dude, we're wasted.
I'm not crashing one of these cars.

256
00:14:32,189 --> 00:14:35,050
I didn't say these cars.

257
00:14:38,904 --> 00:14:41,682
Oh, my God, oh, my God!

258
00:14:43,658 --> 00:14:47,062
- Look, Ma, no hands.
- Stop!

259
00:14:47,162 --> 00:14:48,230
Hey, how do you stop?

260
00:14:48,330 --> 00:14:49,706
Cali.

261
00:14:54,086 --> 00:14:55,879
It's so beautiful.

262
00:14:58,090 --> 00:14:59,591
Aw.

263
00:15:02,886 --> 00:15:04,538
- Mel!
- Suck my dick.

264
00:15:04,638 --> 00:15:07,291
- Suck my dick, just a little bit.
- Seriously?

265
00:15:07,391 --> 00:15:09,001
- There you go.
- That's not funny!

266
00:15:09,101 --> 00:15:11,628
- Holly!
- Okay, I'll do it, I'll do it.

267
00:15:11,728 --> 00:15:13,297
Oh, there we go.

268
00:15:13,397 --> 00:15:14,923
Ooh, yeah, right there. Right there.

269
00:15:15,023 --> 00:15:17,592
- All right.
- Oh, my God.

270
00:15:24,449 --> 00:15:26,643
I'm sorry.

271
00:15:26,743 --> 00:15:29,646
Fix my bangs. Will you fix my bangs?

272
00:15:29,746 --> 00:15:30,814
Sure.

273
00:15:30,914 --> 00:15:34,568
You guys, it is officially Christmas Eve.

274
00:15:34,668 --> 00:15:37,404
Oh? Aww.

275
00:15:37,504 --> 00:15:39,114
It's Christmas, it's Christmas.

276
00:15:39,214 --> 00:15:43,869
Guys, it's God's birthday.

277
00:15:43,969 --> 00:15:45,245
- Happy birthday, God.
- Happy birthday, God.

278
00:15:45,345 --> 00:15:47,581
- Happy birthday, JC.
- Happy birthday, God!

279
00:15:47,681 --> 00:15:50,626
Aah! Ha ha ha!

280
00:15:50,726 --> 00:15:52,502
# God rest ye #

281
00:15:52,602 --> 00:15:54,338
- # Merry gentlemen #
- Oh, my God, here we go.

282
00:15:54,438 --> 00:15:59,301
- Seriously?
- # Let nothing ye dismay #

283
00:15:59,401 --> 00:16:03,597
# Remember Christ our Savior #

284
00:16:03,697 --> 00:16:07,851
# Was born on Christmas day #

285
00:16:07,951 --> 00:16:11,313
# He had a Jesus penis #

286
00:16:11,413 --> 00:16:14,983
# It was long and nice and red #

287
00:16:15,083 --> 00:16:18,195
- # Oh, tidings of comfort #
- # And joy #

288
00:16:18,295 --> 00:16:19,571
# Comfort and joy #

289
00:16:19,671 --> 00:16:23,533
# Bring us tidings of comfort #

290
00:16:23,633 --> 00:16:26,005
# And joy #

291
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:37,464
- I won. You totally cheated.
- Are you kidding me?

292
00:16:37,564 --> 00:16:39,758
- I'm still going.
- Come here, girl.

293
00:16:39,858 --> 00:16:42,052
Give me head.
Give me head, just a little bit.

294
00:17:53,390 --> 00:17:55,626
You're on a rampage.

295
00:17:57,644 --> 00:17:58,729
Nice shot.

296
00:18:00,605 --> 00:18:02,799
Nice shooting, Tex.

297
00:18:02,899 --> 00:18:05,427
That's a perfect round.

298
00:18:05,527 --> 00:18:08,655
- Beat that.
- All right.

299
00:18:14,011 --> 00:18:16,188
Why does that not...
Why doesn't that count?

300
00:18:16,288 --> 00:18:17,981
It's a cow.

301
00:18:20,917 --> 00:18:21,902
All right.

302
00:18:22,002 --> 00:18:23,320
Look, you're a lover, not a hunter.

303
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:24,780
Not everyone has that fire inside.

304
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:27,157
All right, I got to pee.
Where's the bathroom?

305
00:18:27,257 --> 00:18:28,759
Right, I'll find it.

306
00:18:30,594 --> 00:18:33,680
- Well, I'm a hunter and a lover.
- Yeah, girl.

307
00:18:39,811 --> 00:18:42,047
That's too bad.

308
00:18:42,147 --> 00:18:45,149
Oh. Damn it.

309
00:21:23,892 --> 00:21:26,044
I like... I like her.

310
00:21:26,144 --> 00:21:27,629
Whatever.

311
00:21:27,729 --> 00:21:29,231
I'm cool with her.

312
00:21:31,066 --> 00:21:33,260
- Hey, Cali?
- 'Sup, ho?

313
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:35,887
Why are all the photos
in here of Asian people?

314
00:21:35,987 --> 00:21:38,181
Cousins. Extended family.

315
00:21:38,281 --> 00:21:40,684
But you're not Asian.

316
00:21:40,784 --> 00:21:43,286
What? My uncle is. He's adopted.

317
00:21:44,913 --> 00:21:47,774
- Really?
- Yeah.

318
00:21:47,874 --> 00:21:51,294
My grandparents adopted him... from Asia.

319
00:21:55,590 --> 00:21:57,634
You're fucking lying, aren't you?

320
00:22:08,979 --> 00:22:11,757
Okay. The jig is up.

321
00:22:11,857 --> 00:22:14,735
Uh, what jig?

322
00:22:16,069 --> 00:22:18,947
This isn't my uncle's house.

323
00:22:20,490 --> 00:22:22,184
Jesus, Cali.

324
00:22:22,284 --> 00:22:23,952
Well, then whose is it?

325
00:22:26,830 --> 00:22:28,565
It's this family I used to babysit for.

326
00:22:28,665 --> 00:22:31,068
They're, like, super loaded, obviously.

327
00:22:31,168 --> 00:22:33,754
They go away every year
for Christmas for, like, two months.

328
00:22:37,632 --> 00:22:39,509
Are you fucking kidding me, Cali?

329
00:22:40,552 --> 00:22:43,372
We have been drinking all of their liquor
and we're wearing all of their clothes.

330
00:22:43,472 --> 00:22:44,957
And we broke into their house.

331
00:22:45,057 --> 00:22:47,793
Guys, whatever. It's not a big deal.
They're super mellow.

332
00:22:47,893 --> 00:22:49,419
We'll just put everything back
when we're done.

333
00:22:49,519 --> 00:22:51,146
No way. We're leaving right now.

334
00:22:54,632 --> 00:22:56,134
Fine.

335
00:22:56,234 --> 00:22:57,819
- But just...
- Hey, who's here?

336
00:22:59,488 --> 00:23:01,473
- What the fuck was that?
- Fuck. Um...

337
00:23:01,573 --> 00:23:03,767
- Come on, now.
- Hide.

338
00:23:03,867 --> 00:23:05,202
Okay.

339
00:23:09,539 --> 00:23:11,650
- Who the fuck was that?
- I don't know.

340
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:14,820
Do you think that guy
with the beard followed us here?

341
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:17,798
- Hey. Who's in here?
- Shit.

342
00:23:19,424 --> 00:23:22,619
- I thought you said they were gone.
- They are. I don't know who this is.

343
00:23:22,719 --> 00:23:25,414
- Well, what the fuck do you want us to do?
- I see your purses.

344
00:23:25,514 --> 00:23:27,833
Run. Let's just run.
When he gets close, we'll run,

345
00:23:27,933 --> 00:23:30,127
we'll grab our shit,
get the fuck out of here.

346
00:23:32,229 --> 00:23:34,564
- I don't know.
- Go.

347
00:23:42,155 --> 00:23:44,474
- Hey!
- Sorry, dude.

348
00:23:44,574 --> 00:23:46,518
- Hey, hey!
- Let go.

349
00:23:46,618 --> 00:23:49,538
I got you. Take it... Aah!

350
00:24:09,975 --> 00:24:12,336
- Oh, my God.
- Who...

351
00:24:12,436 --> 00:24:13,937
Who is it?

352
00:24:16,106 --> 00:24:18,817
I have no idea.
I've never seen him before.

353
00:24:20,610 --> 00:24:22,279
He... his neck.

354
00:24:24,281 --> 00:24:26,241
What happened?

355
00:24:28,410 --> 00:24:33,190
He grabbed us, and I pushed him.

356
00:24:33,290 --> 00:24:35,375
Let's just go. Let's go.

357
00:24:37,294 --> 00:24:38,795
Wait a second.

358
00:24:47,637 --> 00:24:49,139
He's not breathing.

359
00:24:51,516 --> 00:24:53,477
I'm... I'm gonna call an ambulance.

360
00:24:54,311 --> 00:24:55,379
You can't.

361
00:24:55,479 --> 00:24:57,047
Why? We have to do something.

362
00:24:57,147 --> 00:24:59,758
- What, do you want to go to fucking jail?
- Why? It was an accident.

363
00:24:59,858 --> 00:25:03,261
Holly, we were trespassing.
I don't think it matters.

364
00:25:03,361 --> 00:25:05,597
Because of you, because you
said it was okay to be here.

365
00:25:05,697 --> 00:25:08,433
I'm not the one that pushed him
down the fucking stairs.

366
00:25:08,533 --> 00:25:10,602
That's not what happened.

367
00:25:10,702 --> 00:25:14,039
So you didn't push him down the stairs?

368
00:25:17,417 --> 00:25:19,987
I did. I... I didn't know.

369
00:25:20,087 --> 00:25:23,673
I didn't... Fuck. Fu...

370
00:25:24,758 --> 00:25:26,076
I didn't...

371
00:25:26,176 --> 00:25:27,577
- No, I didn't. I didn't.
- You're okay.

372
00:25:27,677 --> 00:25:29,496
It's not your fault. It wasn't your fault.

373
00:25:29,596 --> 00:25:31,206
You didn't mean for this to happen.

374
00:25:31,306 --> 00:25:32,916
It is, it is.

375
00:25:33,016 --> 00:25:36,919
Holly, breathe. Holly, breathe. Breathe.

376
00:25:39,356 --> 00:25:43,093
It's okay. It's okay. Shh.

377
00:25:44,528 --> 00:25:46,297
It's okay.

378
00:25:52,411 --> 00:25:55,439
- Please, let's just go. I want to go.
- I told you, we can't.

379
00:25:55,539 --> 00:25:58,191
I know, but I...

380
00:25:58,291 --> 00:26:00,110
They'll know we were here.

381
00:26:00,210 --> 00:26:02,279
Like, our fingerprints, right?
They must be everywhere.

382
00:26:02,379 --> 00:26:04,531
Exactly. That's why we don't have a choice.
I have to call the cops.

383
00:26:04,631 --> 00:26:05,849
Wait. Stop.

384
00:26:05,949 --> 00:26:08,452
Just... Let me think.

385
00:26:08,552 --> 00:26:10,954
- Fuck.
- Cali, what are we doing?

386
00:26:11,054 --> 00:26:13,890
We can talk about it all day,
but it's not gonna change anything.

387
00:26:16,601 --> 00:26:18,228
Wait, why not?

388
00:26:21,565 --> 00:26:23,050
I don't get...

389
00:26:23,150 --> 00:26:25,402
Wait, just think about it.
He's dead, right?

390
00:26:26,570 --> 00:26:29,681
So he can't really tell his side
of the story, can he?

391
00:26:29,781 --> 00:26:32,392
Like, like, anything
could've led up to this.

392
00:26:32,492 --> 00:26:35,312
I know, but we still broke into the house.

393
00:26:35,412 --> 00:26:36,855
Yeah, okay, right.

394
00:26:36,955 --> 00:26:39,149
So we broke into the house.
Big deal. It's harmless.

395
00:26:39,249 --> 00:26:42,486
We were just messing around.
But what if he, like...

396
00:26:42,586 --> 00:26:45,464
Like, what if he attacked us or something?

397
00:26:46,339 --> 00:26:48,909
Like, doesn't that change everything
if it was self-defense?

398
00:26:49,009 --> 00:26:51,828
- But he didn't.
- No. God, I know he didn't,

399
00:26:51,928 --> 00:26:54,957
but what I'm saying
is that we say he did. Okay?

400
00:26:55,057 --> 00:26:58,335
As soon as he realized that we were
in here, he attacks one of us.

401
00:26:58,435 --> 00:27:01,171
But what if he's supposed to be here?

402
00:27:01,271 --> 00:27:04,007
He attacked the intruders, you know?

403
00:27:04,107 --> 00:27:06,760
No. No, I told you.
That guy does not live here.

404
00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:09,554
Yeah, but he's obviously a neighbor or
someone who knows that we don't live here,

405
00:27:09,654 --> 00:27:11,348
so I don't think that changes
what Mel was saying.

406
00:27:11,448 --> 00:27:13,600
Okay, yeah, right.
Okay, so it's got to be, like...

407
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:16,453
It's just got to be worse.
It's got to be...

408
00:27:17,829 --> 00:27:19,898
It's got to be more.

409
00:27:19,998 --> 00:27:22,250
Um...

410
00:27:35,138 --> 00:27:36,640
He raped one of us.

411
00:27:38,975 --> 00:27:41,144
He tried to rape one of us.

412
00:27:45,315 --> 00:27:47,592
That's... I can't... I don't.

413
00:27:47,692 --> 00:27:49,052
No, look. Look.

414
00:27:49,152 --> 00:27:51,847
Okay, so he knew we broke in, right?

415
00:27:51,947 --> 00:27:53,932
And as soon as he realized
it was just girls,

416
00:27:54,032 --> 00:27:55,642
he thought he could totally
get away with it because...

417
00:27:55,742 --> 00:28:00,163
I mean, we would never say anything
'cause we... we were trespassing, right?

418
00:28:02,666 --> 00:28:05,168
It's our word versus his, and he's...

419
00:28:07,170 --> 00:28:08,780
you know.

420
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:13,327
We can't just accuse a random guy
of doing that. It'll...

421
00:28:13,427 --> 00:28:17,431
It'll what, Holly, ruin his life?

422
00:28:18,181 --> 00:28:21,418
Look, I'm not gonna defend this idea.
It's a shitty thing to do.

423
00:28:21,518 --> 00:28:23,045
It's the worst thing in the fucking world.

424
00:28:23,145 --> 00:28:24,755
We'll never forget it,
we'll never live it down,

425
00:28:24,855 --> 00:28:27,299
and it's gonna follow us
the rest of our lives.

426
00:28:27,399 --> 00:28:30,277
But we don't have any other move.
It's either this or jail.

427
00:28:32,154 --> 00:28:35,932
I can't. It's not... It's not right.

428
00:28:36,032 --> 00:28:40,395
Right. It's not right.
I don't even know what that means.

429
00:28:40,495 --> 00:28:44,316
This is a matter
of life and death for us, okay?

430
00:28:44,416 --> 00:28:47,210
And not just our lives,
our parents, our families.

431
00:28:49,379 --> 00:28:52,174
You think your dad is gonna
get reelected after this?

432
00:28:53,550 --> 00:28:55,927
His career is over, and you know it.

433
00:28:58,993 --> 00:29:01,583
I'm gonna get kicked out of law school.

434
00:29:01,683 --> 00:29:04,294
And my mom's gonna kill herself.

435
00:29:04,394 --> 00:29:05,562
Exactly.

436
00:29:07,731 --> 00:29:10,509
I mean, this is the responsible thing
to do if you think about it.

437
00:29:10,609 --> 00:29:13,945
At least this way, we just take
the burden on ourselves, you know?

438
00:29:15,197 --> 00:29:17,307
We're the only ones that know the truth,

439
00:29:17,407 --> 00:29:20,118
and we're the only ones
that'll get fucked up by it.

440
00:29:22,037 --> 00:29:25,290
If we go the other way,
we take everyone else down with us.

441
00:29:35,008 --> 00:29:39,413
Okay. We'll say that we came in.
I knew the house from babysitting.

442
00:29:39,513 --> 00:29:41,290
We were bored. We knew it would be empty.

443
00:29:41,390 --> 00:29:44,668
We came in, drank a little bit,
played around. All harmless stuff.

444
00:29:44,768 --> 00:29:47,421
Then that guy, I guess,
saw lights from the street.

445
00:29:47,521 --> 00:29:50,132
Or maybe he was following
us all night... doesn't matter.

446
00:29:50,232 --> 00:29:51,591
We didn't know his motives.

447
00:29:51,691 --> 00:29:53,468
But he came inside, and he saw us.

448
00:29:53,568 --> 00:29:57,848
And he, like, flew into a horny rage or
whatever, and he tried to rape one of us.

449
00:29:57,948 --> 00:30:00,567
But then they struggled and pushed back,
and he fell down the stairs,

450
00:30:00,668 --> 00:30:03,603
broke his neck, like what really happened.

451
00:30:03,703 --> 00:30:05,956
No blood on our hands. Right?

452
00:30:10,043 --> 00:30:11,878
So who's the victim?

453
00:30:13,797 --> 00:30:15,424
Closest to "A."

454
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:03,180
All right.

455
00:31:07,184 --> 00:31:10,587
So what do we do?

456
00:31:10,687 --> 00:31:13,090
Well, he was trying to rape you,

457
00:31:13,190 --> 00:31:16,193
so maybe he ripped your shirt.

458
00:31:17,736 --> 00:31:19,721
Okay.

459
00:31:19,821 --> 00:31:21,932
Should I just do it?

460
00:31:22,032 --> 00:31:23,408
Yeah.

461
00:31:24,284 --> 00:31:26,311
Yeah, just a little bit.

462
00:31:26,411 --> 00:31:27,704
Okay.

463
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:35,988
Like that?

464
00:31:36,088 --> 00:31:37,881
Here, let me give it a try.

465
00:31:40,384 --> 00:31:42,119
Jesus, Cali.

466
00:31:42,219 --> 00:31:45,472
- Are you all right, Holl?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

467
00:31:47,724 --> 00:31:49,751
How many are you gonna take?

468
00:31:49,851 --> 00:31:55,007
I mean, like, ideally, it would be a clump,
but I'll just do a couple, okay?

469
00:31:55,107 --> 00:31:56,216
Mm-hmm.

470
00:31:56,316 --> 00:31:58,693
- Ow, fuck.
- Sorry.

471
00:31:59,403 --> 00:32:01,738
And I will wrap it around his fingers.

472
00:32:04,908 --> 00:32:06,993
Okay, um...

473
00:32:10,122 --> 00:32:11,623
Okay.

474
00:32:13,917 --> 00:32:16,002
Hey, what about skin?

475
00:32:17,254 --> 00:32:20,841
I feel like I've seen that on TV.
Like, like, skin under the nails?

476
00:32:21,591 --> 00:32:24,261
I mean, yeah,
the more evidence the better.

477
00:32:27,389 --> 00:32:30,584
If we're gonna do this,
we have to do it right.

478
00:32:30,684 --> 00:32:31,768
Okay.

479
00:32:33,937 --> 00:32:35,772
- Okay.
- Move in closer.

480
00:32:46,908 --> 00:32:48,101
Okay.

481
00:32:48,201 --> 00:32:50,020
Let's take a look.

482
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:51,621
Yeah.

483
00:32:53,081 --> 00:32:55,292
I think that looks pretty convincing.

484
00:32:57,961 --> 00:32:59,588
Yeah.

485
00:33:16,188 --> 00:33:17,965
Looks good.

486
00:33:18,065 --> 00:33:19,524
Yeah.

487
00:33:21,985 --> 00:33:23,653
You ready?

488
00:33:25,822 --> 00:33:29,284
I... I just...

489
00:33:30,827 --> 00:33:33,121
I know, I know. It's...

490
00:33:35,673 --> 00:33:37,850
It's really hard.

491
00:33:38,335 --> 00:33:40,170
But we're so close.

492
00:33:45,842 --> 00:33:47,511
We're almost finished.

493
00:33:52,182 --> 00:33:54,184
Okay.

494
00:33:59,856 --> 00:34:01,608
Thank you.

495
00:35:30,822 --> 00:35:32,641
Did you do it?

496
00:35:32,741 --> 00:35:33,909
Yeah.

497
00:35:36,787 --> 00:35:39,856
You sure you got enough?

498
00:35:39,956 --> 00:35:41,291
Yeah.

499
00:35:50,092 --> 00:35:51,885
You guys ready?

500
00:36:00,477 --> 00:36:01,978
Oh, God.

501
00:36:05,690 --> 00:36:07,883
Oh, God. Holly.

502
00:36:09,653 --> 00:36:11,221
He just fell on the...

503
00:36:11,321 --> 00:36:15,492
From the stairs. I don't know what to do.

504
00:36:17,786 --> 00:36:22,107
Oh, my God. You were just standing there.

505
00:36:22,207 --> 00:36:23,692
You didn't do anything.

506
00:36:23,792 --> 00:36:27,404
He was just laying there,
and he was just completely dead.

507
00:36:27,504 --> 00:36:31,007
I didn't know what to do.
You looked so scared.

508
00:36:32,843 --> 00:36:34,578
Oh, God.

509
00:36:34,678 --> 00:36:37,581
Oh, God. Oh, God.

510
00:36:37,681 --> 00:36:39,641
Okay.

511
00:36:40,517 --> 00:36:43,045
Wait, stop.

512
00:36:43,145 --> 00:36:44,463
What was that?

513
00:36:44,563 --> 00:36:46,523
What is what?

514
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:11,465
What happened?

515
00:37:12,382 --> 00:37:14,676
I can't feel my legs.

516
00:37:18,096 --> 00:37:20,123
Um...

517
00:37:20,223 --> 00:37:22,225
you fell down the stairs.

518
00:37:23,477 --> 00:37:27,089
Did you... Did you call an ambulance?

519
00:37:27,189 --> 00:37:29,007
Is someone coming to help me?

520
00:37:36,448 --> 00:37:41,853
I can't breathe. Please. Please help me.

521
00:37:41,953 --> 00:37:45,816
- What the hell do we do?
- I don't know. I don't know.

522
00:37:45,916 --> 00:37:47,751
I can't.

523
00:37:50,796 --> 00:37:52,823
Wh... What...

524
00:37:52,923 --> 00:37:55,008
What do you want with me?

525
00:37:56,635 --> 00:38:00,455
Um, we have to go talk in the other room.

526
00:38:00,555 --> 00:38:04,267
What were you doing with my hand?

527
00:38:10,399 --> 00:38:14,720
Please, I don't know what this is.

528
00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:20,642
I need an ambulance right now.

529
00:38:20,742 --> 00:38:22,394
I...

530
00:38:22,494 --> 00:38:25,080
can't wait.

531
00:38:30,752 --> 00:38:32,295
Who are you?

532
00:38:35,799 --> 00:38:38,076
My name is Arthur.

533
00:38:38,176 --> 00:38:40,971
I'm the groundskeeper.

534
00:38:42,973 --> 00:38:44,374
I'm sorry.

535
00:38:44,474 --> 00:38:47,310
I'm sorry I grabbed you before.

536
00:38:49,146 --> 00:38:50,355
But...

537
00:38:52,232 --> 00:38:54,134
take my phone.

538
00:38:54,234 --> 00:38:58,155
Take my phone and call 911.

539
00:38:59,030 --> 00:39:01,742
I won't tell what happened here.

540
00:39:02,909 --> 00:39:04,578
I'll never tell a soul.

541
00:39:06,997 --> 00:39:08,832
On my word.

542
00:39:11,334 --> 00:39:14,321
Wait, please, please, please, please.

543
00:39:14,421 --> 00:39:16,840
You can't leave me here.

544
00:39:30,353 --> 00:39:33,131
Let's just do it. Let's go
and hope he doesn't say anything.

545
00:39:33,231 --> 00:39:35,300
What, are you fucking kidding me?

546
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:36,969
We have no reason to trust him.

547
00:39:37,069 --> 00:39:39,680
He's seen our faces.
And he knows what you were doing.

548
00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:41,515
He saw you with his hand.

549
00:39:41,615 --> 00:39:43,266
How the hell didn't you see he was awake?

550
00:39:43,366 --> 00:39:47,996
I don't know. He... He wasn't moving.

551
00:39:49,956 --> 00:39:51,608
I believe him, Cali.

552
00:39:51,708 --> 00:39:54,444
I don't think he's gonna
say anything. I trust him.

553
00:39:54,544 --> 00:39:57,281
- I don't know why, but I do.
- Oh, that's great, Holly.

554
00:39:57,381 --> 00:40:00,217
That's really fucking great
that you trust him, but I don't.

555
00:40:03,053 --> 00:40:07,265
Well, what then? What are we gonna do?
We can't just sit here.

556
00:40:12,062 --> 00:40:13,588
Why not?

557
00:40:13,688 --> 00:40:14,840
What?

558
00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:17,175
Why don't we just, like,
wait for a little bit?

559
00:40:17,275 --> 00:40:21,054
I mean, he's in really bad shape, right?
What if we just didn't help him?

560
00:40:21,154 --> 00:40:24,641
Maybe everything would
just kind of work itself out.

561
00:40:24,741 --> 00:40:27,144
It's the same thing as going in there
right now and killing him.

562
00:40:27,244 --> 00:40:29,213
No. No, it's not, not really.

563
00:40:31,213 --> 00:40:32,649
How is it not?

564
00:40:32,749 --> 00:40:36,987
Look, we thought we killed him before,
and we were prepared to deal with it.

565
00:40:37,087 --> 00:40:40,032
So what's the difference if he wakes up
for a couple minutes and then dies?

566
00:40:40,132 --> 00:40:42,951
It's the exact same thing
as him falling down the stairs

567
00:40:43,051 --> 00:40:46,455
and being alive for a couple seconds,
only it's, like, a little bit longer.

568
00:40:46,555 --> 00:40:49,541
No, the difference is that now
we could do something about it.

569
00:40:49,641 --> 00:40:51,752
We can call an ambulance and get him help.

570
00:40:51,852 --> 00:40:53,754
Yeah, and what if he dies anyway?

571
00:40:53,854 --> 00:40:57,424
You saw him in there. You heard his voice.
He's completely fucked.

572
00:40:57,524 --> 00:41:00,010
We'll be totally screwing ourselves
if we call the ambulance,

573
00:41:00,110 --> 00:41:02,888
and then he dies
before they even get here.

574
00:41:02,988 --> 00:41:05,282
We get the worst of both worlds.

575
00:41:06,533 --> 00:41:08,869
Look, we're already doing it.

576
00:41:41,735 --> 00:41:43,679
No, no, of course not.

577
00:41:43,779 --> 00:41:45,430
Well, actually, I don't want to say that.

578
00:41:45,530 --> 00:41:48,517
Last summer, I didn't do
much other than see concerts.

579
00:41:48,617 --> 00:41:51,494
But I mean, since then,
I haven't touched anything really.

580
00:41:53,330 --> 00:41:55,832
I heard... I heard about the whole...

581
00:42:06,843 --> 00:42:08,954
"Bald eagles, the US national bird,

582
00:42:09,054 --> 00:42:12,332
makes some of the largest nests
in the animal kingdom.

583
00:42:12,432 --> 00:42:15,335
They use the same nest year after year,
sometimes for decades,

584
00:42:15,435 --> 00:42:20,757
constantly adding twigs, branches, moss,
feathers, and other nesting material.

585
00:42:20,857 --> 00:42:24,594
One found in Florida in 1963 had
a weight of more than two tons,

586
00:42:24,694 --> 00:42:27,656
a diameter of ten feet,
and was 20 feet deep."

587
00:42:30,701 --> 00:42:31,868
Huh.

588
00:42:32,953 --> 00:42:34,746
I'm gonna go check on him.

589
00:43:10,866 --> 00:43:12,659
Please.

590
00:43:19,750 --> 00:43:21,835
He's still alive.

591
00:43:25,525 --> 00:43:28,659
- Damn it.
- How long do we have to wait like this?

592
00:43:28,759 --> 00:43:30,385
As long as it takes.

593
00:43:31,553 --> 00:43:33,413
Well, what if it takes forever?

594
00:43:33,513 --> 00:43:35,599
What if he's like this for days?

595
00:43:36,558 --> 00:43:39,561
Then we'll figure it out. I don't know.

596
00:43:42,439 --> 00:43:44,818
Who the fuck is that?

597
00:43:45,609 --> 00:43:47,886
- Ben.
- Jesus Christ.

598
00:43:47,986 --> 00:43:48,971
What?

599
00:43:49,071 --> 00:43:51,406
Well, we can't just leave him there
in plain sight. Let's go!

600
00:43:54,659 --> 00:43:55,686
Fuck.

601
00:43:55,786 --> 00:43:57,521
Guys, right here, behind the couch.

602
00:43:57,621 --> 00:43:59,522
Pull, Mel.

603
00:44:03,251 --> 00:44:04,753
Oh, my God.

604
00:44:09,341 --> 00:44:12,035
Okay, let me just go talk to him.
I'm just gonna tell him to leave.

605
00:44:12,135 --> 00:44:14,579
No way. You're all fucked up. I'll do it.

606
00:44:14,679 --> 00:44:16,248
Well, what are you gonna say to him?

607
00:44:16,348 --> 00:44:18,917
I have no idea,
but I will figure it out, okay?

608
00:44:19,017 --> 00:44:21,228
Mel, you come with me. You stay here.

609
00:44:33,657 --> 00:44:35,617
Yo, you guys in there?

610
00:44:39,162 --> 00:44:40,772
Hey, Ben.

611
00:44:40,872 --> 00:44:43,692
Hey. What's up?

612
00:44:43,792 --> 00:44:45,419
Can I come in?

613
00:44:48,630 --> 00:44:50,741
Sorry, no.

614
00:44:50,841 --> 00:44:54,344
What? Come on, I'm freezing
my balls off out here. Let me in.

615
00:44:56,054 --> 00:44:58,248
Um...

616
00:44:58,348 --> 00:45:00,183
we know what you did.

617
00:45:01,977 --> 00:45:05,605
What are you on right now? What did I do?

618
00:45:17,701 --> 00:45:19,202
Man...

619
00:45:20,620 --> 00:45:22,831
I should've stayed home tonight.

620
00:45:25,208 --> 00:45:26,710
Just my luck.

621
00:45:36,762 --> 00:45:38,722
I got kids.

622
00:45:41,641 --> 00:45:43,210
I got two girls.

623
00:45:43,310 --> 00:45:45,228
Please don't.

624
00:45:49,191 --> 00:45:54,888
Look, Ben, Holly doesn't
want to see you right now. Sorry.

625
00:45:54,988 --> 00:45:58,058
Why not? What are you talking about?

626
00:45:58,158 --> 00:46:00,143
You're not saying anything.

627
00:46:00,243 --> 00:46:02,162
We know you cheated on her.

628
00:46:05,248 --> 00:46:06,900
All right, not funny anymore.

629
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,152
- I'm coming in. Where is she?
- Hey, look, it's not okay.

630
00:46:09,252 --> 00:46:11,029
You can't... Sorry, you got to go.

631
00:46:11,129 --> 00:46:12,739
Bullshit. I won't.

632
00:46:12,839 --> 00:46:14,866
- She knows I wouldn't do that.
- Get the fuck out of here, Ben.

633
00:46:14,966 --> 00:46:16,618
You're being a psycho. Jesus.

634
00:46:16,718 --> 00:46:18,912
What? I'm gonna call the cops.

635
00:46:19,012 --> 00:46:21,248
- Go ahead.
- Ben!

636
00:46:24,976 --> 00:46:26,962
You got to help me.

637
00:46:27,062 --> 00:46:29,172
I'm dying.

638
00:46:29,272 --> 00:46:30,841
I didn't want any of this.

639
00:46:30,941 --> 00:46:33,510
We were just fucking around.
It's Cali's fault.

640
00:46:33,610 --> 00:46:36,154
- I was just...
- It's okay. It's okay.

641
00:46:39,116 --> 00:46:42,202
I won't tell. I won't tell.

642
00:46:43,453 --> 00:46:46,123
I mean, people make mistakes.

643
00:46:53,630 --> 00:46:55,866
I forgive you, okay?

644
00:46:55,966 --> 00:46:57,592
I forgive you.

645
00:47:00,303 --> 00:47:02,472
You got to let me go.

646
00:47:06,351 --> 00:47:08,145
I won't tell a soul.

647
00:47:10,313 --> 00:47:14,985
I swear to fucking God!

648
00:47:22,242 --> 00:47:23,869
Holly!

649
00:47:26,371 --> 00:47:28,398
Don't, don't, don't.

650
00:47:28,498 --> 00:47:30,943
Shh. Shh. Shh.
I need you to be quiet, okay?

651
00:47:31,043 --> 00:47:33,403
I want to help you, but I...
You just need to be quiet, okay?

652
00:47:33,503 --> 00:47:35,338
Okay.

653
00:47:48,842 --> 00:47:50,770
Holly.

654
00:47:55,859 --> 00:47:57,736
Help, help.

655
00:47:59,362 --> 00:48:00,806
Help!

656
00:48:00,906 --> 00:48:04,268
What the fuck is going on right now?
Open the door, Holly.

657
00:48:04,368 --> 00:48:06,395
Go away. Just go.

658
00:48:06,495 --> 00:48:08,313
What the hell was Cali talking about?

659
00:48:08,413 --> 00:48:11,416
Do you seriously think
I would cheat on you?

660
00:48:31,561 --> 00:48:34,965
I don't want any of this right now.
Please, just go.

661
00:48:35,065 --> 00:48:36,550
Are you kidding me?

662
00:48:36,650 --> 00:48:40,362
I just drove 45 minutes.
I'm not going anywhere until we talk.

663
00:48:56,628 --> 00:48:58,171
Listen...

664
00:48:59,506 --> 00:49:02,034
I'm sorry I'm yelling so much.

665
00:49:02,134 --> 00:49:05,137
I just honestly don't know
where any of this is coming from.

666
00:49:08,890 --> 00:49:10,292
I love you.

667
00:49:10,392 --> 00:49:13,019
You know I would never do
anything like that.

668
00:49:17,733 --> 00:49:19,234
Ben...

669
00:49:21,153 --> 00:49:25,282
if you love me, you'll leave... right now.

670
00:49:48,221 --> 00:49:50,791
All right.

671
00:49:50,891 --> 00:49:52,225
I'll go.

672
00:49:53,810 --> 00:49:55,562
Bye, Holly.

673
00:49:59,749 --> 00:50:01,468
Such bullshit.

674
00:50:01,568 --> 00:50:03,011
Bye-bye, Romeo.

675
00:50:03,111 --> 00:50:05,155
Bitch.

676
00:50:18,043 --> 00:50:19,736
What the fuck was that?

677
00:50:19,836 --> 00:50:21,630
- Was that you?
- No.

678
00:50:36,561 --> 00:50:38,105
You little shit.

679
00:50:45,362 --> 00:50:47,931
He said he's not gonna tell anyone.

680
00:50:48,031 --> 00:50:49,683
What are you, fucking stupid?

681
00:50:49,783 --> 00:50:51,101
You actually trust him?

682
00:50:51,201 --> 00:50:53,103
After that shit he just pulled?

683
00:50:53,203 --> 00:50:54,646
No.

684
00:50:54,746 --> 00:50:57,040
He is just trying to save his own ass.

685
00:50:58,041 --> 00:50:59,610
We have to do something.

686
00:50:59,710 --> 00:51:01,612
Cali, we're talking about killing someone.

687
00:51:01,712 --> 00:51:03,947
We thought he was dead, Holly.
We all thought he was dead.

688
00:51:04,047 --> 00:51:06,341
We thought we killed him.
So what's the difference?

689
00:51:09,052 --> 00:51:10,554
I'll do it.

690
00:51:11,763 --> 00:51:14,458
I'm ready to do it. Let's just...

691
00:51:14,558 --> 00:51:19,730
You guys stay here, and you can just
pretend like none of this ever happened.

692
00:51:20,731 --> 00:51:22,899
It's not the same thing, Cali.

693
00:51:23,692 --> 00:51:26,178
It's one thing
to kill someone accidentally,

694
00:51:26,278 --> 00:51:29,806
but if we go in there now,
and if we do this, it's just different.

695
00:51:29,906 --> 00:51:32,768
I can't believe I am fucking
explaining this again.

696
00:51:32,868 --> 00:51:36,813
What exactly do you want to do,
Mel, just leave?

697
00:51:36,913 --> 00:51:38,999
Do you actually think that will work?

698
00:51:39,791 --> 00:51:41,318
Think about it.

699
00:51:41,418 --> 00:51:43,570
There is absolutely no scenario
where we weren't in this house.

700
00:51:43,670 --> 00:51:48,283
Even if he's telling the truth and doesn't
say anything, they'll know we were here.

701
00:51:48,383 --> 00:51:52,329
There's no happy ending where we just
walk out of here and everything's fine.

702
00:51:52,429 --> 00:51:56,892
Either we take action,
or we turn ourselves in.

703
00:51:59,269 --> 00:52:01,338
Then we turn ourselves in.

704
00:52:01,438 --> 00:52:03,674
No.

705
00:52:03,774 --> 00:52:05,634
We're not gonna do that.

706
00:52:05,734 --> 00:52:07,219
I am not gonna do that.

707
00:52:07,319 --> 00:52:09,012
Well, it's not your decision.

708
00:52:09,112 --> 00:52:11,573
There's three of us,
and I say we don't kill him.

709
00:52:12,824 --> 00:52:14,618
I say we do.

710
00:52:17,329 --> 00:52:19,790
Come on, Mel, don't throw this all away.

711
00:52:27,255 --> 00:52:29,164
I'm sorry.

712
00:52:30,884 --> 00:52:34,746
I can't... I can't kill someone
in cold blood, not like this.

713
00:52:34,846 --> 00:52:36,957
I just can't do it.

714
00:52:37,057 --> 00:52:38,642
I just can't.

715
00:52:41,895 --> 00:52:43,438
Fine.

716
00:52:45,357 --> 00:52:48,568
But I don't think either of you realize
what this is gonna do to us.

717
00:52:54,700 --> 00:52:58,612
- So what do we do?
- Call the police, I guess.

718
00:53:00,163 --> 00:53:01,565
We're gonna tell the truth?

719
00:53:01,665 --> 00:53:04,484
- Yeah.
- The entire truth?

720
00:53:04,584 --> 00:53:07,212
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay.

721
00:53:09,715 --> 00:53:12,342
Let me just go get my phone,
and we'll all do it together.

722
00:53:27,065 --> 00:53:28,925
I can't...

723
00:53:29,025 --> 00:53:31,695
I can't believe
we were just at your house.

724
00:53:34,031 --> 00:53:36,158
Now...

725
00:53:38,910 --> 00:53:41,121
I know exactly what you mean.

726
00:53:43,582 --> 00:53:46,985
I can just picture us in my living room

727
00:53:47,085 --> 00:53:49,363
with my brother and my dad.

728
00:53:49,463 --> 00:53:51,624
And his sunglasses.

729
00:53:52,424 --> 00:53:54,968
Why the hell does he wear
those things all the time?

730
00:53:56,887 --> 00:54:00,182
It's because he still smokes all the time.

731
00:54:04,686 --> 00:54:07,255
He thinks nobody knows,

732
00:54:07,355 --> 00:54:11,401
so he doesn't anyone
to see how stoned he is.

733
00:54:16,406 --> 00:54:20,894
But there's nothing more conspicuous
than those fucking sunglasses.

734
00:54:22,704 --> 00:54:25,207
It's true.

735
00:54:28,585 --> 00:54:30,612
Is that you?

736
00:54:30,712 --> 00:54:32,155
No.

737
00:54:32,255 --> 00:54:34,908
Then what...

738
00:54:35,008 --> 00:54:36,118
Oh, my God.

739
00:54:36,218 --> 00:54:38,553
Cali. Oh, my God.

740
00:54:43,975 --> 00:54:48,088
Cali! Cali, open the door!

741
00:54:48,188 --> 00:54:49,506
Open the door!

742
00:54:49,606 --> 00:54:53,260
Cali! You don't have to do this!

743
00:54:53,360 --> 00:54:56,013
You don't have to don't do this, Cali!

744
00:54:56,113 --> 00:54:58,414
Cali! Cali, don't do this!

745
00:54:58,514 --> 00:55:02,252
Cali! Cali!

746
00:55:02,452 --> 00:55:06,857
Open the door! Please, Cali!

747
00:55:06,957 --> 00:55:08,775
Please open it!

748
00:55:10,127 --> 00:55:11,486
Don't do it!

749
00:55:11,586 --> 00:55:14,506
Cali! Please!

750
00:55:19,219 --> 00:55:22,597
Cali! Open the door!

751
00:56:13,857 --> 00:56:15,884
You're a murderer.

752
00:56:15,984 --> 00:56:18,303
At least I can admit it.

753
00:56:18,403 --> 00:56:22,015
You said you couldn't do it, so I did.

754
00:56:22,115 --> 00:56:24,268
I did what needed to be done.

755
00:56:24,368 --> 00:56:26,144
None of this needed to be done.

756
00:56:26,244 --> 00:56:28,480
We could've walked away.
We could've turned ourselves in.

757
00:56:28,580 --> 00:56:31,441
We could've stayed at Mel's house
and watched a fucking movie!

758
00:56:31,541 --> 00:56:35,045
Well, we didn't!
So now we're here and so is he.

759
00:56:38,215 --> 00:56:40,008
What was it like?

760
00:56:41,385 --> 00:56:42,761
What?

761
00:56:44,930 --> 00:56:46,390
Him dying.

762
00:56:47,849 --> 00:56:49,810
Was it fast?

763
00:56:53,939 --> 00:56:57,984
Yeah. It... It just sort of happened.

764
00:56:59,986 --> 00:57:02,556
I put a pillow over his face.

765
00:57:02,656 --> 00:57:04,808
He couldn't move.

766
00:57:04,908 --> 00:57:07,411
He just stopped breathing.

767
00:57:09,538 --> 00:57:11,231
It's like he went to sleep.

768
00:57:11,331 --> 00:57:13,483
This doesn't change anything.
It only makes it worse.

769
00:57:13,583 --> 00:57:15,861
This changes everything.
I just gave us a way out of this.

770
00:57:15,961 --> 00:57:18,864
- It's back to the way it was.
- This is different, and you know it.

771
00:57:18,964 --> 00:57:21,825
We put him at the bottom
of the stairs like before.

772
00:57:21,925 --> 00:57:24,369
We call the cops. We tell the same story.

773
00:57:24,469 --> 00:57:26,763
We said we weren't gonna kill him.
We voted.

774
00:57:27,889 --> 00:57:29,458
Things changed.

775
00:57:29,558 --> 00:57:31,476
It's time for a new vote.

776
00:57:32,602 --> 00:57:37,341
I say we stick with the original plan,
don't go to jail.

777
00:57:37,441 --> 00:57:38,675
Holly?

778
00:57:38,775 --> 00:57:42,863
I say we tell the truth, everything,
including you killing him.

779
00:57:52,706 --> 00:57:57,736
Mel, please,
you know we can't get away with this.

780
00:57:57,836 --> 00:58:00,113
If we tell the truth,
it won't be as bad for us

781
00:58:00,213 --> 00:58:02,115
because she's the one
who fucking killed him.

782
00:58:02,215 --> 00:58:06,370
That is bullshit, and you know it.
If we turn ourselves in, we're all fucked.

783
00:58:06,470 --> 00:58:08,872
Mel,

784
00:58:08,972 --> 00:58:12,476
your life doesn't need
to be over right now.

785
00:58:14,936 --> 00:58:17,005
He's gone.

786
00:58:17,105 --> 00:58:18,982
We're still here.

787
00:58:21,234 --> 00:58:22,944
That's all that matters.

788
00:58:26,740 --> 00:58:29,159
He's really dead, isn't he?

789
00:58:37,250 --> 00:58:39,820
I'm sorry, Holly.

790
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:42,406
I can't...

791
00:58:42,506 --> 00:58:44,633
I can't throw it all away.

792
00:58:46,676 --> 00:58:47,761
I can't.

793
00:58:54,601 --> 00:58:58,063
Okay. So we're doing it.

794
00:58:59,147 --> 00:59:01,274
Holly?

795
00:59:03,694 --> 00:59:06,405
Yeah, we are.

796
00:59:08,031 --> 00:59:09,449
Fucking bitch!

797
00:59:11,660 --> 00:59:13,520
Don't do it.

798
00:59:14,620 --> 00:59:16,023
You guys, stop it!

799
00:59:16,123 --> 00:59:17,983
- You think you can...
- Stop it!

800
00:59:18,083 --> 00:59:19,610
Get the fuck off of me!

801
01:00:24,900 --> 01:00:28,512
It's the same story,
just a little different.

802
01:00:28,612 --> 01:00:31,223
We get to the house,
we fuck around for a minute.

803
01:00:31,323 --> 01:00:33,517
Guy shows up, we freak.

804
01:00:33,617 --> 01:00:36,019
Now here's where it changes.

805
01:00:36,119 --> 01:00:38,021
He attacks Holly,

806
01:00:38,121 --> 01:00:41,191
only not on the stairs this time,
in the sitting room.

807
01:00:41,291 --> 01:00:45,696
So he's trying to rape her, but she gets away
for a second and knocks over the table.

808
01:00:45,796 --> 01:00:47,197
So now she's on the ground.

809
01:00:47,297 --> 01:00:50,158
He goes over to the table and then,
in the heat of the moment or whatever

810
01:00:50,258 --> 01:00:51,910
he just starts bashing her over the head.

811
01:00:52,010 --> 01:00:53,704
And that's where we come in
and we're like,

812
01:00:53,804 --> 01:00:55,706
"That's our friend, you motherfucker."

813
01:00:55,806 --> 01:00:58,542
So you attack him, and he drops
the thing, and I run in and grab it.

814
01:00:58,642 --> 01:01:01,086
And before he can do
anything to you, I hit him.

815
01:01:01,186 --> 01:01:03,714
And then I'm, like, in this
uncontrollable rage, you know?

816
01:01:03,814 --> 01:01:07,342
So I just keep hitting him,
and I can't fucking stop, right?

817
01:01:07,442 --> 01:01:09,052
And that's why his neck is so fucked up.

818
01:01:09,152 --> 01:01:11,221
I just kept going.

819
01:01:11,321 --> 01:01:12,889
"I don't know why I did it, sir.

820
01:01:12,989 --> 01:01:14,349
I just saw my friend on the ground,

821
01:01:14,449 --> 01:01:17,594
and I just saw that bastard,
and I just kept hitting him."

822
01:01:19,413 --> 01:01:21,748
And that's how we get out of this.

823
01:01:22,958 --> 01:01:25,068
You ready?

824
01:01:50,694 --> 01:01:51,862
Yes.

825
01:01:56,700 --> 01:01:58,201
Please, please.

826
01:02:00,287 --> 01:02:01,772
Piece of shit, come on.

827
01:02:01,872 --> 01:02:03,248
Please.

828
01:02:07,044 --> 01:02:10,422
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

829
01:02:22,601 --> 01:02:24,311
Cali, don't.

830
01:02:26,980 --> 01:02:28,674
I have to.

831
01:02:28,774 --> 01:02:32,302
You're making me do this.

832
01:02:32,402 --> 01:02:33,820
Fine, then do it.

833
01:02:39,201 --> 01:02:40,827
Get off me!

834
01:02:46,083 --> 01:02:49,044
You should've just kept
your fucking mouth shut!

835
01:02:49,961 --> 01:02:51,989
Now, Mel, do it!

836
01:02:52,089 --> 01:02:53,907
Fucking do it!

837
01:02:54,007 --> 01:02:55,742
Mel!

838
01:03:43,557 --> 01:03:46,001
What?

839
01:03:46,101 --> 01:03:47,936
She was bad.

840
01:03:50,021 --> 01:03:51,982
She was gonna kill me.

841
01:03:54,151 --> 01:03:57,304
Mel, it's okay.

842
01:03:57,404 --> 01:04:02,267
Everything's gonna be fine.
Everything's gonna be fine.

843
01:04:02,367 --> 01:04:04,144
Everything's gonna be fine, Mel.

844
01:04:04,244 --> 01:04:07,731
Mel. Mel, look at me.

845
01:04:07,831 --> 01:04:12,110
Everything's gonna be fine.
Everything's gonna be fine.

846
01:04:12,210 --> 01:04:14,129
Look at me.

847
01:04:34,191 --> 01:04:36,151
So what now?

848
01:04:45,869 --> 01:04:47,496
I'll do whatever you want.

849
01:04:58,340 --> 01:05:01,218
Well, neither one of us
have to go to jail, Mel.

850
01:05:02,719 --> 01:05:04,346
It was Cali's fault.

851
01:05:07,849 --> 01:05:11,295
She brought us here, she killed him,

852
01:05:11,395 --> 01:05:13,922
and now she's gone.

853
01:05:14,022 --> 01:05:18,110
And that's the justice here.
That's what's right.

854
01:05:21,405 --> 01:05:24,182
Maybe she had a point, too, you know.

855
01:05:24,282 --> 01:05:28,245
It doesn't... doesn't just affect us.
It's our families.

856
01:05:32,666 --> 01:05:35,502
Maybe the right thing to do here is lie.

857
01:05:42,008 --> 01:05:43,635
Okay.

858
01:05:46,346 --> 01:05:47,597
How?

859
01:06:03,155 --> 01:06:04,932
She's a hero.

860
01:06:05,032 --> 01:06:08,185
# Silent night #

861
01:06:08,285 --> 01:06:11,813
- That's the story.
- # Holy night #

862
01:06:11,913 --> 01:06:14,358
He pulled me into the room,
and he started to attack me,

863
01:06:14,458 --> 01:06:17,027
ripping my shirt,
shoving his hand into my pants.

864
01:06:17,127 --> 01:06:18,779
# All is calm #

865
01:06:18,879 --> 01:06:22,032
That's when Cali came in
and saw what was happening.

866
01:06:22,132 --> 01:06:23,367
# All is bright #

867
01:06:23,467 --> 01:06:25,285
She started hitting him and he...

868
01:06:25,385 --> 01:06:27,120
he snapped the leg off of this table,

869
01:06:27,220 --> 01:06:30,791
and he hit her in the head.
He hit her hard.

870
01:06:30,891 --> 01:06:35,462
So then we both jumped on him,
and he dropped it, and we picked it up.

871
01:06:35,562 --> 01:06:37,089
And you hit him first.

872
01:06:37,189 --> 01:06:40,926
You stopped after that,
but I grabbed it from you and kept going.

873
01:06:41,026 --> 01:06:43,053
# Infant so tender and mild #

874
01:06:43,153 --> 01:06:44,654
I was angry.

875
01:06:47,449 --> 01:06:50,560
After a minute, we looked down.

876
01:06:50,660 --> 01:06:54,231
- Cali wasn't breathing.
- # Sleep in heavenly peace #

877
01:06:54,331 --> 01:06:56,249
She was gone.

878
01:06:57,918 --> 01:07:00,696
So she died saving me.

879
01:07:00,796 --> 01:07:05,242
She was my best friend,
and she died for me.

880
01:07:05,342 --> 01:07:08,161
# Sleep in heavenly peace #

881
01:07:08,261 --> 01:07:11,390
- And that's when we carried 911.
- Ready?

882
01:07:13,892 --> 01:07:17,920
# Silent night #

883
01:07:19,189 --> 01:07:24,678
# Holy night #

884
01:07:24,778 --> 01:07:30,100
# All is calm #

885
01:07:30,200 --> 01:07:35,647
# All is bright #

886
01:07:35,747 --> 01:07:41,278
# Round yon virgin #

887
01:07:41,378 --> 01:07:46,658
# Mother and child #

888
01:07:46,758 --> 01:07:51,622
# Holy infant #

889
01:07:51,722 --> 01:07:56,810
# So tender and mild #

890
01:07:58,019 --> 01:08:00,547
# Sleep #

891
01:08:00,647 --> 01:08:04,676
# In heavenly #

892
01:08:04,776 --> 01:08:10,307
# Peace #

893
01:08:10,407 --> 01:08:17,147
# Sleep in heavenly #

894
01:08:17,247 --> 01:08:21,501
# Peace #

895
01:08:23,962 --> 01:08:29,493
# Silent night #

896
01:08:29,593 --> 01:08:34,831
# Holy night #

897
01:08:34,931 --> 01:08:40,170
# Shepherds quake #

898
01:08:40,270 --> 01:08:45,676
# At the sight #

899
01:08:45,776 --> 01:08:50,347
# Glories stream #

900
01:08:50,447 --> 01:08:56,019
# From heaven above #

901
01:08:56,119 --> 01:09:01,275
# Heavenly hosts #

902
01:09:01,375 --> 01:09:07,864
# Sing "Hallelujah" #

903
01:09:07,964 --> 01:09:12,703
# Christ the Savior #

904
01:09:12,803 --> 01:09:15,867
# Is born #

905
01:09:20,143 --> 01:09:26,717
# Christ the Savior #

906
01:09:26,817 --> 01:09:32,739
# Is born ##
