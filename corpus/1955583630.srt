175
00:10:52,451 --> 00:10:55,320
- after he broke up with Kalie.
- ( sighs )

176
00:10:55,421 --> 00:10:57,989
Honestly, Nat, I don't know
how you two used to be a couple.

177
00:10:58,090 --> 00:11:00,925
Tess, he kissed me on the cheek
once when we were five.

178
00:11:01,027 --> 00:11:03,071
Besides, he didn't ask me out.

179
00:11:03,095 --> 00:11:05,407
He asked me to the hockey game
and to the party after.

180
00:11:05,431 --> 00:11:06,598
What'd you tell him?

181
00:11:06,699 --> 00:11:08,266
That I had plans with my dad.

182
00:11:08,367 --> 00:11:09,834
Right.

183
00:11:09,935 --> 00:11:11,580
Hey, did you tell him
about the big news yet?

184
00:11:11,604 --> 00:11:14,164
Oh, shoot,
I was supposed to call.

185
00:11:14,206 --> 00:11:15,573
Or...

186
00:11:31,023 --> 00:11:32,057
Oh, boy.

187
00:11:38,164 --> 00:11:39,464
I'm so sorry.

188
00:11:41,567 --> 00:11:44,046
You know,
these things, they're...

189
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:46,314
They're just popularity
contests.

190
00:11:46,338 --> 00:11:49,207
You don't think I'm popular?

191
00:11:49,308 --> 00:11:51,086
No, no, no, no,
what I mean is...

192
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:55,046
I mean that they never pick
the smartest,

193
00:11:55,147 --> 00:11:57,707
or the most over...
You know.

194
00:11:57,750 --> 00:12:00,185
They never...

195
00:12:00,286 --> 00:12:01,920
What?

196
00:12:02,021 --> 00:12:05,557
No! No! No!

197
00:12:05,658 --> 00:12:07,192
- Yes? Really?
- Yes.

198
00:12:07,293 --> 00:12:10,095
You swear?
Oh, my gosh!

199
00:12:10,196 --> 00:12:13,832
That's so great!
I'm so proud of you.

200
00:12:13,933 --> 00:12:16,244
Good job.
Oh, man.

201
00:12:16,268 --> 00:12:18,937
- You deserve an Oscar.
- Thank you very much.

202
00:12:19,038 --> 00:12:21,149
You want to join us
for celebration tonight?

203
00:12:21,173 --> 00:12:22,674
Nah, you two enjoy.

204
00:12:22,775 --> 00:12:24,042
All right, let's do it.

205
00:12:24,143 --> 00:12:27,679
I cannot believe it.
That's so cool!

206
00:12:36,355 --> 00:12:40,692
And the winner reaps her reward,

207
00:12:40,793 --> 00:12:44,095

Martin Parish...</i>

208

210
00:12:54,473 --> 00:12:56,207
( sighs )
You were a winner today.

211
00:12:58,711 --> 00:13:00,311
But now you lose.

212
00:13:04,183 --> 00:13:05,884
Dad...

213
00:13:05,985 --> 00:13:09,154
Something's wrong? What, I put...
Too much syrup on it?

214
00:13:09,255 --> 00:13:11,689
No, no, it's great.

215
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:16,327
It is, mm, it is great.
Great.

216
00:13:16,428 --> 00:13:18,196
- But...
- What?

217
00:13:20,499 --> 00:13:23,168
I kind of want

218
00:13:23,269 --> 00:13:27,338
to do something fun tonight.

219
00:13:27,439 --> 00:13:30,275
Oh, wait a minute, you want
a different game, right?

220
00:13:30,376 --> 00:13:33,344
Well, there's a hockey game
this afternoon, and I thought

221
00:13:33,445 --> 00:13:35,190
maybe it would be good thing
to go and say thank you

222
00:13:35,214 --> 00:13:39,951
to everyone because
of the election and... right?

223
00:13:40,052 --> 00:13:43,121
I get it.

224
00:13:43,222 --> 00:13:46,558
Do some glad-handing,
kiss some babies.

225
00:13:49,461 --> 00:13:50,695
That sounds fine.

226
00:13:50,796 --> 00:13:54,165
Okay.
Well, I'll go change.

227
00:13:54,266 --> 00:13:55,433
Okay.

I'll see you after the game.

231
00:14:30,569 --> 00:14:31,769
Hey, Marty!

232
00:14:39,245 --> 00:14:41,056
Should've told me
you were coming.

233
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,757
I would've brought
another seat warmer.

234
00:14:42,781 --> 00:14:45,183
Oh, that's all right, Bruce.
Nice to see you, Julie.

235
00:14:45,284 --> 00:14:47,395
We heard Natalie's
a big winner today, too.

236
00:14:47,419 --> 00:14:49,320
Yes, yes, I guess she is.

237
00:14:49,421 --> 00:14:51,956
Guess she's gonna be working
for Sam now, huh?

238
00:14:52,057 --> 00:14:53,391
Maybe.

239
00:14:57,463 --> 00:15:00,832
You know,
we never see you
at these things.

240
00:15:00,933 --> 00:15:03,134
Yeah, well,
Natalie wanted to come,

241
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:05,436
so it was either here or,
you know,

242
00:15:05,537 --> 00:15:07,639
stay home
and draw up blueprints.

243
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:13,054
I can't believe
you made me come here.

244
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:15,513
It's one game.

245
00:15:15,614 --> 00:15:16,981
Hey, Natalie.

246
00:15:19,852 --> 00:15:21,819
Maybe you should dip
into the school treasury

247
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:23,788
and buy yourself
a shirt that fits.

248
00:15:26,258 --> 00:15:27,769
Maybe you should dip
into your trust fund

249
00:15:27,793 --> 00:15:29,260
and buy yourself a brain.

00:15:39,204 --> 00:15:41,583
I have to go pick her up.
Are you okay?

253
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:42,774
Yeah.

254
00:16:08,167 --> 00:16:09,477
- Yay!
- Yeah!

( crowd cheering )

256
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:21,556
Martin, hockey
was never this big

257
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:23,325
when we were in high school,
was it?

258
00:16:23,349 --> 00:16:24,849
It's hard to say.

259
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:27,652
We weren't the kind
to care too much.

260
00:16:29,388 --> 00:16:31,055
I'm freezing.

261
00:16:31,156 --> 00:16:33,301
I'm gonna go get us
some hot chocolates.

262
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:35,560
No whipped cream, right?

263
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:37,028
That's right.

264
00:16:41,533 --> 00:16:43,167
Let's talk shop.

265
00:16:43,268 --> 00:16:45,513
Jimmy Woodrow said everything
went really well today.

266
00:16:45,537 --> 00:16:48,106
- Oh, that's great.
- He really likes your style.

267
00:16:48,207 --> 00:16:50,185
He's not so keen
on your brother-in-law, though.

268
00:16:50,209 --> 00:16:52,143
I had to vouch for him.

269
00:16:52,244 --> 00:16:55,013
I'm really grateful
for what you're doing, Bruce.

270
00:16:55,114 --> 00:16:57,158
I'm not doing anything,
all right?

271
00:16:57,182 --> 00:16:59,694
Just introducing
a hardworking friend

272
00:16:59,718 --> 00:17:02,420
to a client who needs
some hard work done.

273
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:04,332
A lot more's gonna
come from this.

274
00:17:04,356 --> 00:17:07,425
Once the neighbors see this
beautiful pergola being built,

275
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:08,926
they're all gonna want one.

276
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:11,573
That's what it's like
in Deer Hills.

277
00:17:11,597 --> 00:17:12,730
I hope so.

Dad, I invited some people over.
That okay?

285
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:42,437
It's a school night.
I don't think so.

286

Aw, let him have some fun.
He's earned it.

Uh, is that okay, Dad?

Sure, if Mr. and Mrs. Cahill
are okay with it,

found some blood.

00:23:17,429 --> 00:23:19,697
You had me so worried.

352
00:23:19,798 --> 00:23:21,078
Martin.

353
00:23:23,135 --> 00:23:26,170
Sorry to interrupt.
I'm Detective Will Schaffer.

354
00:23:26,271 --> 00:23:28,339
Martin Parish.

355
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:30,674
Natalie, do you mind
if I ask you a few questions?

356
00:23:30,776 --> 00:23:34,879
Yeah, you can ask her
a few questions.

357
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:38,282
Martin, why don't you come
to my office for a couple
minutes, huh?

358
00:23:38,383 --> 00:23:40,017
<i>Come on.</i>

359
00:23:43,555 --> 00:23:45,389
I'll be right outside, okay?

360
00:23:50,896 --> 00:23:52,740
Will: <i>Mr. Parish,
Natalie's gonna be fine.</i>

361
00:23:52,764 --> 00:23:57,334
Her story is that nobody
did anything wrong.

362
00:23:57,436 --> 00:23:59,703
The body examination
corroborates.

363
00:23:59,805 --> 00:24:01,725
There was no sign of a struggle.

364
00:24:01,773 --> 00:24:04,809
There's no indication that this
was non-consensual sex.

365
00:24:04,910 --> 00:24:06,377
You said there was blood.

366
00:24:06,478 --> 00:24:07,545
<i>There was.</i>

367
00:24:10,849 --> 00:24:12,983
It was her first time, Martin.

368
00:24:15,253 --> 00:24:17,331
<i>Sometimes kids don't
really know their limit,</i>

369
00:24:17,355 --> 00:24:19,100
especially when alcohol's
involved.

370
00:24:19,124 --> 00:24:20,924
- Who did this to her?
- <i>Mr. Parish.</i>

371
00:24:20,959 --> 00:24:22,726
To be clear...

372
00:24:22,828 --> 00:24:25,930
no one<i> did</i> anything
to Natalie, do you understand?

373
00:24:30,302 --> 00:24:32,636
Do you know a boy
named Sam Cahill?

374
00:24:35,607 --> 00:24:36,674
Yeah.

375
00:24:38,877 --> 00:24:41,545
Natalie says that the sex
was consensual.

376
00:24:41,646 --> 00:24:43,814
- Oh, man.
- Here.

377
00:24:47,986 --> 00:24:51,155
If she changes her story,
gimme a call.

378
00:24:58,930 --> 00:25:00,431
Take her home, Marty.

379
00:25:11,276 --> 00:25:13,077
So you know him personally?

380
00:25:13,178 --> 00:25:15,323
Yeah, I treated his wife, Sarah.

381
00:25:15,347 --> 00:25:17,314
Bone cancer.

382
00:25:17,415 --> 00:25:19,884
She died when Natalie
was four years old.

383
00:25:22,053 --> 00:25:23,721
The girl's all he's got.

384
00:25:32,597 --> 00:25:34,909
Um... honey,
can I make you some food?

385
00:25:34,933 --> 00:25:38,035
'Cause you gotta be hungry.
And then we can talk?

386
00:25:38,136 --> 00:25:40,938
I'm just really tired.

387
00:25:44,242 --> 00:25:48,312
Okay, but, I mean...
we can talk, right?

388
00:25:50,515 --> 00:25:53,150
I'm just really tired.

389
00:25:53,251 --> 00:25:54,531
Okay.

390
00:26:07,566 --> 00:26:09,333
Nat.

391
00:26:09,434 --> 00:26:11,212
Oh, my God, are you okay?

392
00:26:11,236 --> 00:26:14,338
- Why, what have you heard?
- What everyone else has,

393
00:26:14,439 --> 00:26:15,983
that you spent the night
in the hospital?

394
00:26:16,007 --> 00:26:17,641
What? How?

395
00:26:17,742 --> 00:26:20,021
They said that the cops
came to Sam's house

396
00:26:20,045 --> 00:26:24,148
and broke up the party,
after you ended up unconscious.

397
00:26:24,249 --> 00:26:26,116
Do you want to talk about it?

398
00:26:26,217 --> 00:26:28,652
- I have nothing to say.
- Natalie.

399
00:26:28,753 --> 00:26:31,755
Careful, guys,
or Ms. Lightweight here

400
00:26:31,856 --> 00:26:33,891
- might vomit on your shoes.
- ( laughter )

401
00:26:33,992 --> 00:26:35,893
Gotta get to class.

402
00:26:43,034 --> 00:26:46,003
Knock yourself out.
She didn't even touch it?

403
00:26:46,104 --> 00:26:47,671
She's okay now?

404
00:26:47,772 --> 00:26:49,517
She seems to be, yeah.

405
00:26:49,541 --> 00:26:53,344
Well... great,
Great, Martin.

406
00:26:53,445 --> 00:26:55,646
I mean, what a relief.

407
00:26:55,747 --> 00:26:58,015
We had a real scare up here

408
00:26:58,116 --> 00:26:59,427
with the cops knocking
down the door

409
00:26:59,451 --> 00:27:01,385
in the middle of the night
and all that.

410
00:27:01,486 --> 00:27:03,120
You have to know I had no idea.

411
00:27:03,221 --> 00:27:05,556
When Sam said he had friends
coming over, I had no idea.

412
00:27:05,657 --> 00:27:09,159
No, of course not, I know,
but still, you could've...

413
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:12,029
I just feel so bad
about the whole thing.

414
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:13,631
You let them hang
in the basement.

415
00:27:13,732 --> 00:27:15,532
You trust that they're not
up to no good.

416
00:27:15,634 --> 00:27:18,335
And then the cops show up,
and it's just a whole big mess?

417
00:27:18,436 --> 00:27:21,038
I'm just so glad
that she's okay.

418
00:27:24,609 --> 00:27:27,211
She just wants things
to get back to normal.

419
00:27:27,312 --> 00:27:28,812
Yeah, yeah.
These things happen.

420
00:27:28,913 --> 00:27:31,115
We all just have to move on,
right?

421
00:27:32,984 --> 00:27:35,319
Speaking of which,
I just got off the phone

422
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:36,987
with James Woodrow.

423
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:38,799
He doesn't want
to wait any longer.

424
00:27:38,823 --> 00:27:41,383
He asked if you and Nick
can start tomorrow.

425
00:27:43,461 --> 00:27:46,830
That's great,
but we don't even have

426
00:27:46,931 --> 00:27:49,333
- the plans laid out yet.
- It doesn't matter.

427
00:27:49,434 --> 00:27:51,312
You just head on up
and start mapping out

428
00:27:51,336 --> 00:27:53,896
your plans on the clock,
and listen,

429
00:27:53,972 --> 00:27:56,450
if there's anything else
Julie and I can do,

430
00:27:56,474 --> 00:27:57,752
you let us know.

431
00:27:57,776 --> 00:28:01,111
There is actually
just one more thing.

432
00:28:01,212 --> 00:28:03,714
Um...

433
00:28:03,815 --> 00:28:05,883
Maybe Detective Schaffer
told you

434
00:28:05,984 --> 00:28:08,218
that they had to test Natalie
with a, uh...

435
00:28:08,319 --> 00:28:09,853
a rape kit?

436
00:28:13,825 --> 00:28:15,426
Gee, Martin.

437
00:28:15,527 --> 00:28:18,228
No, no,
he failed to mention that.

438
00:28:18,329 --> 00:28:20,641
Probably because it didn't
amount to anything, it's just...

439
00:28:20,665 --> 00:28:22,933
Is Natalie saying that Sam...

440
00:28:23,034 --> 00:28:25,235
No, no, not at all.

441
00:28:25,336 --> 00:28:27,604
It's...
It's just a precaution.

442
00:28:27,706 --> 00:28:30,607
All right.

443
00:28:30,709 --> 00:28:32,443
All right.

444
00:28:32,544 --> 00:28:35,612
Anyway, I just, um...

445
00:28:35,714 --> 00:28:38,348
I thought you should know.

446
00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:39,783
Of course.

447
00:29:02,006 --> 00:29:04,007
Teacher:
<i>Okay, everybody.</i>

448
00:29:04,109 --> 00:29:07,311
<i>Mr. President, why don't
you tell us what you think?</i>

449
00:29:07,412 --> 00:29:09,880
<i>Sam.</i>

450
00:29:11,816 --> 00:29:14,918
Uh, yeah.
Sounds good.

451
00:29:20,959 --> 00:29:24,461
Natalie.
Natalie.

452
00:29:24,562 --> 00:29:26,830
We need to talk.

453
00:29:26,931 --> 00:29:29,032
Please, leave me alone.

454
00:29:47,685 --> 00:29:49,486
So how was school today? Hey.

455
00:29:49,587 --> 00:29:53,290
Did you know that the police
went to the Cahills

456
00:29:53,391 --> 00:29:57,327
after I went to the hospital?

457
00:29:57,428 --> 00:30:00,264
Yeah, yeah, I, uh...

458
00:30:00,365 --> 00:30:02,866
I knew that.

459
00:30:02,967 --> 00:30:06,103
Did you tell them to?

460
00:30:06,204 --> 00:30:08,872
No, I didn't tell them to.

461
00:30:08,973 --> 00:30:11,642
But you told them
where the party was.

462
00:30:11,743 --> 00:30:15,212
Honey, I... I told them
everything that I knew.

463
00:30:18,716 --> 00:30:19,883
What?

464
00:30:24,155 --> 00:30:26,490
Everyone's talking.

465
00:30:26,591 --> 00:30:28,625
They're just concerned.

466
00:30:28,726 --> 00:30:32,029
Why? Why can't everyone
just mind their own business?

467
00:30:34,199 --> 00:30:36,700
<i>- ( door slams ) -</i> ( Sighs )

468
00:30:41,606 --> 00:30:43,640
( whirring )

469
00:30:56,154 --> 00:30:57,487
Hey.

470
00:30:59,324 --> 00:31:02,826
So there's a B-movie marathon
at the Prestige.

471
00:31:02,927 --> 00:31:05,696
Thought maybe we could go,
do our own voiceovers.

472
00:31:05,797 --> 00:31:08,165
I have a lot of homework.

473
00:31:08,266 --> 00:31:10,133
<i>Okay.</i>

474
00:31:10,235 --> 00:31:12,169
<i>Well, maybe some other time.</i>

475
00:31:44,802 --> 00:31:46,336
Okay.

476
00:31:51,109 --> 00:31:53,310
- Ready?
- ( engine turns over )

477
00:32:38,957 --> 00:32:41,468
You should try the chicken.
It's good.

478
00:32:41,492 --> 00:32:43,093
Just not really hungry.

479
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:50,334
Okay.

480
00:32:57,342 --> 00:32:58,608
Tess!

481
00:33:13,458 --> 00:33:16,660
Don't see you
around much anymore.

482
00:33:16,761 --> 00:33:18,929
Yeah, sorry.

483
00:33:23,101 --> 00:33:24,901
Tess, you know
you can talk to me, right?

484
00:33:27,538 --> 00:33:28,818
I know.

485
00:33:31,776 --> 00:33:35,712
Natalie hasn't really been
acting like herself lately, huh?

486
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:41,985
Look, I'm just trying
to understand what's going on,

487
00:33:42,086 --> 00:33:43,653
and she's not talking to me.

488
00:33:43,755 --> 00:33:46,256
Has she said anything to you
about that night at all?

489
00:33:46,357 --> 00:33:49,593
She's been pretty much
avoiding me

490
00:33:49,694 --> 00:33:51,661
and everyone else ever since.

491
00:33:51,763 --> 00:33:53,497
What about Sam?

492
00:33:56,701 --> 00:33:58,335
What?

493
00:33:58,436 --> 00:34:00,180
Look, I don't want to get anyone
into any trouble.

494
00:34:00,204 --> 00:34:02,806
You won't get anybody into
any trouble, I promise you.

495
00:34:04,342 --> 00:34:07,177
( sighs )
So the day after the party,

496
00:34:07,278 --> 00:34:10,347
I saw Natalie
and Sam in the hall.

497
00:34:10,448 --> 00:34:14,117
He was chasing after her.
He was trying to talk to her.

498
00:34:14,218 --> 00:34:16,720
He grabbed her.

499
00:34:16,821 --> 00:34:19,222
How did he grab her?

500
00:34:19,323 --> 00:34:21,525
Her arm.

501
00:34:21,626 --> 00:34:23,637
Look, she was trying
to get away from him.

502
00:34:23,661 --> 00:34:26,040
He grabbed her arm,
but then she pulled away

503
00:34:26,064 --> 00:34:27,631
and ran off.

504
00:34:27,732 --> 00:34:29,399
I don't know.

505
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:31,168
It was probably nothing.

506
00:34:33,704 --> 00:34:35,305
Yeah, probably.

507
00:34:43,014 --> 00:34:45,215
♪

508
00:35:21,018 --> 00:35:22,953
( telephone rings )

509
00:35:26,624 --> 00:35:28,758
Detective Schaffer.

510
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:32,262
Hi, Detective,
this is Martin Parish.

511
00:35:32,363 --> 00:35:33,864
I'm Natalie's father.

512
00:35:33,965 --> 00:35:35,742
<i>I brought her
into the hospital for...</i>

513
00:35:35,766 --> 00:35:38,135
I remember you, Mr. Parish.
What can I do for you?

514
00:35:38,236 --> 00:35:42,672
Well, you said to give you
a call if anything changed,

515
00:35:42,773 --> 00:35:47,043
and, um... well,
I've been seeing symptoms,

516
00:35:47,145 --> 00:35:50,313
and Sam Cahill,
he grabbed Natalie in school,

517
00:35:50,414 --> 00:35:51,815
and it sounded pretty rough,

518
00:35:51,916 --> 00:35:54,818
and I just thought that
it might be relevant.

519
00:35:54,919 --> 00:35:56,520
Natalie told you this?

520
00:35:58,956 --> 00:36:03,193
No, no, her...
Her best friend, um...

521
00:36:03,294 --> 00:36:06,196
Tess Gerty,
she saw the whole thing.

522
00:36:06,297 --> 00:36:09,866
Okay, well, um...

523
00:36:09,967 --> 00:36:12,802
I'm afraid it's only relevant
if Natalie's changed her story

524
00:36:12,904 --> 00:36:14,604
<i>about what happened that night.</i>

525
00:36:16,574 --> 00:36:18,855
<i>Otherwise it's just it's just
a couple of kids...</i>

526
00:36:24,115 --> 00:36:26,016
No, n... she has.

527
00:36:26,117 --> 00:36:27,450
<i>I'm sorry?</i>

528
00:36:27,552 --> 00:36:29,753
Yeah, Natalie,
she has changed her story.

529
00:36:33,491 --> 00:36:35,992
Uh, okay.

530
00:36:36,093 --> 00:36:39,930
Okay, well, then we're going to
need to get her on the record

531
00:36:40,031 --> 00:36:41,064
giving her side...

532
00:36:41,165 --> 00:36:43,600
Okay, well, see, the thing is,

533
00:36:43,701 --> 00:36:47,837
is that I don't... I don't think
that she's ready for
that quite yet.

534
00:36:47,939 --> 00:36:50,273
She...
It's a bit overwhelming,

535
00:36:50,374 --> 00:36:53,243
and I'm the only person
that she's talking to about it.

536
00:36:53,344 --> 00:36:56,947
Um... so I just
don't want to rush her.

537
00:36:58,950 --> 00:37:01,430
But I also read it's important
to start these investigations

538
00:37:01,519 --> 00:37:03,720
as soon as possible,
so I just thought

539
00:37:03,821 --> 00:37:06,856
that if I called you that
we could start the...

540
00:37:06,958 --> 00:37:08,792
<i>I understand.</i>

541
00:37:08,893 --> 00:37:11,595
Listen, I'll bring Sam Cahill
in tomorrow.

542
00:37:11,696 --> 00:37:13,707
I'll get his side of the story
in full detail.

543
00:37:13,731 --> 00:37:15,899
Once we have that,
then maybe Natalie

544
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,045
will feel a little more
comfortable telling her side.

545
00:37:18,069 --> 00:37:20,203
<i>I'll be in touch.</i>

546
00:37:20,304 --> 00:37:21,671
Okay, thank you.

547
00:37:28,012 --> 00:37:32,649
Tell us in your own words
what happened the night
of the party.

548
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:36,953
We're saying he's not
here to actually testify.
He's here of his own volition.

549
00:37:37,054 --> 00:37:38,899
I'm just trying
to get to the bottom

550
00:37:38,923 --> 00:37:40,757
of what happened that night.

551
00:37:40,858 --> 00:37:43,460
Now neither you
or I were in that room

552
00:37:43,561 --> 00:37:45,339
to give any sort of response
about what it was.

553
00:37:45,363 --> 00:37:48,465
So I need to hear from Sam
exactly what happened.

554
00:38:04,148 --> 00:38:05,682
Hey, sweetie.

555
00:38:05,783 --> 00:38:08,295
I was going to wake you,
but you looked so peaceful.

556
00:38:08,319 --> 00:38:10,879
Fish won't bite all day, though.

557
00:38:10,921 --> 00:38:12,088
You're going fishing?

558
00:38:12,189 --> 00:38:14,157
Nope,<i> we're</i> going fishing.

559
00:38:14,258 --> 00:38:16,218
- Dad, I don't...
- Lake Hopatcong.

560
00:38:16,294 --> 00:38:17,971
It's where your mom and I used
to go when we were

561
00:38:17,995 --> 00:38:19,940
a little bit overwhelmed
or stressed.

562
00:38:19,964 --> 00:38:22,524
It's a relaxing kind of place,
and you're gonna love it.

563
00:38:25,503 --> 00:38:27,237
So get dressed.

564
00:38:29,974 --> 00:38:31,174
Okay.

565
00:38:35,279 --> 00:38:37,480
( sighs )

566
00:38:37,581 --> 00:38:40,650
- So I have it unlocked.
- Wait, is this locked?

567
00:38:41,986 --> 00:38:43,253
Yeah, you're good.

568
00:38:43,354 --> 00:38:46,022
So I'm gonna cast first.
Ready?

569
00:38:46,123 --> 00:38:47,123
Mm-hmm.

570
00:38:50,027 --> 00:38:51,561
There you go.

571
00:38:51,662 --> 00:38:52,896
Okay, then lock it.

572
00:38:52,997 --> 00:38:54,864
Okay.

573
00:38:54,965 --> 00:38:57,267
Watch the...
There you go.

574
00:38:57,368 --> 00:38:59,402
Nice.

575
00:38:59,503 --> 00:39:02,205
Done, there you go.

576
00:39:02,306 --> 00:39:03,873
- Okay.
- All right.

577
00:39:07,645 --> 00:39:09,879
Now what?

578
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:11,581
Now we wait.

579
00:39:15,686 --> 00:39:17,487
Kind of boring, isn't it?

580
00:39:20,224 --> 00:39:22,692
If by boring,
you mean relaxing, then, yes.

581
00:39:22,793 --> 00:39:24,728
It is incredibly boring.

582
00:39:31,535 --> 00:39:33,570
How's student council going?

583
00:39:33,671 --> 00:39:34,951
It's fine.

584
00:39:37,174 --> 00:39:39,275
Have you started planning
the Winter Formal yet?

585
00:39:39,377 --> 00:39:41,444
Unfortunately, yes.

586
00:39:41,545 --> 00:39:44,414
Do sophomores
get to go to that dance?

587
00:39:44,515 --> 00:39:46,727
If they're asked
by a junior or a senior.

588
00:39:46,751 --> 00:39:48,418
Ah, that's right.

589
00:39:48,519 --> 00:39:50,353
That's how I first went,
you know.

590
00:39:50,454 --> 00:39:51,898
I thought you and mom met
at graduation

591
00:39:51,922 --> 00:39:55,592
with the famous
flying cap story.

592
00:39:55,693 --> 00:39:57,160
We did.

593
00:39:59,597 --> 00:40:01,231
I went with Julie.

594
00:40:04,034 --> 00:40:05,335
Julie...

595
00:40:05,436 --> 00:40:07,003
Cahill now.

596
00:40:07,104 --> 00:40:09,939
Rogers then.

597
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:11,808
You never told me
that you dated Mrs. Cahill.

598
00:40:11,909 --> 00:40:14,177
That was a long time ago.

599
00:40:14,278 --> 00:40:16,123
Besides, your mother
was my first real girlfriend.

600
00:40:16,147 --> 00:40:17,514
Julie and I were just...

601
00:40:17,615 --> 00:40:20,316
casual.

602
00:40:20,418 --> 00:40:21,851
Dad, ew.

603
00:40:21,952 --> 00:40:24,521
I'm just saying,
I know how it is at that age.

604
00:40:24,622 --> 00:40:28,658
Sometimes things don't feel
so black and white.

605
00:40:28,759 --> 00:40:31,161
Can get confusing.
There's a lot of peer pressure...

606
00:40:31,262 --> 00:40:33,196
Okay, Dad.

607
00:40:33,297 --> 00:40:35,064
Okay.

608
00:40:35,166 --> 00:40:37,767
I'm just saying, if you want
to talk to me about it.

609
00:40:39,670 --> 00:40:41,281
Whoa, whoa, what do I do?
What do I do?

610
00:40:41,305 --> 00:40:42,785
Okay, all right, all right,
all right.

611
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:45,041
We got a fish on.
That's good.

612
00:40:45,142 --> 00:40:47,510
So what I want you to do
is we're gonna tire him out.

613
00:40:47,611 --> 00:40:51,648
Okay, this just a matter
of waiting the fish out.
We're gonna exhaust him,

614
00:40:51,749 --> 00:40:53,483
so when I say, go,

615
00:40:53,584 --> 00:40:56,553
I want you to set the hook.
That just means give
a little tug.

616
00:40:56,654 --> 00:41:00,390
Se the hook.
Just pull that. Good.

617
00:41:00,491 --> 00:41:01,991
Now you got him.

618
00:41:02,092 --> 00:41:03,693
- Okay?
- Okay.

619
00:41:03,794 --> 00:41:05,995
Now just, uh...

620
00:41:06,096 --> 00:41:07,808
Come here, buddy.
All right, come here.

621
00:41:07,832 --> 00:41:09,432
I'm gonna reach out.

622
00:41:09,533 --> 00:41:12,035
Oh, look at that.

623
00:41:12,136 --> 00:41:15,338
Huh? So pretty.

624
00:41:15,439 --> 00:41:17,841
Here. Pet him.

625
00:41:17,942 --> 00:41:19,108
Just pet him.

626
00:41:19,210 --> 00:41:20,410
( both laugh )

627
00:41:20,511 --> 00:41:24,013
- Just pet it.
- ( laughs )

628
00:41:25,316 --> 00:41:26,493
What should we name him?

629
00:41:26,517 --> 00:41:28,685
<i>Um, Food.</i>

630
00:41:28,786 --> 00:41:30,954
( chattering )

631
00:41:31,055 --> 00:41:32,355
( reel whirs )

632
00:41:32,456 --> 00:41:33,756
Oh!

633
00:41:33,858 --> 00:41:36,226
( laughs )

634
00:41:36,327 --> 00:41:39,896
We caught a pier.
( laughs )

635
00:41:39,997 --> 00:41:43,166
If we're talking about poundage,
then this guy won.

636
00:41:43,267 --> 00:41:47,537
But it's all about the catch,
and I caught more.

637
00:41:47,638 --> 00:41:49,906
Well...

638
00:41:50,007 --> 00:41:52,141
I can't argue with that.

639
00:41:54,578 --> 00:41:56,312
What's the matter?

640
00:41:56,413 --> 00:41:59,883
I think I just...
spent too much time in the sun.

641
00:41:59,984 --> 00:42:03,286
Okay, why don't you
just go take a shower,

642
00:42:03,387 --> 00:42:04,754
and I'll prep the feast?

643
00:42:04,855 --> 00:42:06,689
Okay, don't do too much
without me, though.

644
00:42:06,790 --> 00:42:08,391
I want to learn
the whole process.

645
00:42:11,495 --> 00:42:12,829
You got it.

646
00:42:17,868 --> 00:42:20,236
<i>( beeps ) Martin,
this is Detective Schaffer.</i>

647
00:42:20,337 --> 00:42:23,072
<i>Look, I spoke
with Sam Cahill today.</i>

648
00:42:23,173 --> 00:42:25,942
<i>His story is that Natalie
asked to go up to his room</i>

649
00:42:26,043 --> 00:42:29,445
<i>and it was consensual
the whole way through.</i>

650
00:42:29,547 --> 00:42:33,316
<i>So if Natalie has a different
story like you said,</i>

651
00:42:33,417 --> 00:42:36,419
<i>I'm really going to need
to hear it myself.</i>

652
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:38,398
<i>Otherwise there's nothing else
I can do.</i>

653
00:42:38,422 --> 00:42:40,142
- <i>( beeps )</i>
- What'd you do?

654
00:42:48,432 --> 00:42:50,266
Natalie,
you're not talking to me,

655
00:42:50,367 --> 00:42:51,367
and I just figured I'd...

656
00:42:51,435 --> 00:42:53,169
So you lied to the police?

657
00:42:53,270 --> 00:42:56,005
No, I... look...

658
00:42:56,106 --> 00:42:58,346
I just feel like you're maybe
a little confused.

659
00:42:58,409 --> 00:42:59,876
I am not confused.

660
00:42:59,977 --> 00:43:01,811
You are, you... okay,

661
00:43:01,912 --> 00:43:03,957
You're not acting like yourself.
You're moping around.

662
00:43:03,981 --> 00:43:05,882
You're acting down.
You're not...

663
00:43:05,983 --> 00:43:08,785
That's because you couldn't
take care of me that night

664
00:43:08,886 --> 00:43:12,055
without getting
the whole world involved.

665
00:43:12,156 --> 00:43:14,724
Now I'm the girl
who partied too hard,

666
00:43:14,825 --> 00:43:17,345
who went to the hospital
then broke up the party...

667
00:43:17,394 --> 00:43:19,395
Let me ask you a question.
No, no, no, listen.

668
00:43:19,496 --> 00:43:21,364
How do you think it feels
to be driving down

669
00:43:21,465 --> 00:43:23,633
the middle of the road
and see your daughter

670
00:43:23,734 --> 00:43:26,369
swaying all over the place
and then slurring her words?

671
00:43:26,470 --> 00:43:29,539
- You're vomiting...
- I was drunk, Dad!

672
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:31,785
- That's what happens!
- Not to people like you!

673
00:43:31,809 --> 00:43:34,744
I acted my age for once
in my life,

674
00:43:34,845 --> 00:43:36,823
and I end up with you,
the police,

675
00:43:36,847 --> 00:43:40,383
doctors interrogating me while
my head is still spinning!

676
00:43:40,484 --> 00:43:42,185
Here's what I'm asking you,
okay?

677
00:43:42,286 --> 00:43:44,297
If you're ready to talk
about it, I'm ready to listen.

678
00:43:44,321 --> 00:43:46,723
- You're not listening to me!
- I<i> am</i> listening to you!

679
00:43:46,824 --> 00:43:50,026
You're not listening to me!

680
00:43:50,127 --> 00:43:52,829
I had sex with Sam Cahill!

681
00:43:52,930 --> 00:43:55,498
Okay.

682
00:43:55,599 --> 00:43:58,668
He didn't force me to drink.

683
00:43:58,769 --> 00:44:01,329
He didn't force me
to do anything.

684
00:44:02,973 --> 00:44:06,643
I asked him to take me upstairs.

685
00:44:06,744 --> 00:44:09,679
I had sex with him
because I wanted to.

686
00:44:12,383 --> 00:44:15,184
And, yeah.

687
00:44:15,285 --> 00:44:17,520
I've been down.

688
00:44:17,621 --> 00:44:20,023
Because losing your virginity

689
00:44:20,124 --> 00:44:22,792
is supposed to be
a special memory,

690
00:44:22,893 --> 00:44:26,529
not some big public circus

691
00:44:26,630 --> 00:44:29,365
that you are only making worse!

692
00:44:31,869 --> 00:44:33,236
Baby, I'm trying to fix.

693
00:44:33,337 --> 00:44:36,372
No. No! No!

694
00:44:36,473 --> 00:44:38,341
Don't "baby" me.

695
00:44:38,442 --> 00:44:43,179
I am not your baby girl anymore,
so stop treating me like one.

696
00:44:48,786 --> 00:44:50,186
Okay.

697
00:45:00,130 --> 00:45:01,431
I'm sorry.

698
00:45:05,402 --> 00:45:07,722
I'm sorry if it's hard
for you to hear.

699
00:45:09,273 --> 00:45:12,175
I really am.
But maybe if mom was here...

700
00:45:12,276 --> 00:45:13,776
No, no, no, no.

701
00:45:13,877 --> 00:45:16,612
No, you don't...
You don't get to say that, okay?

702
00:45:16,714 --> 00:45:18,581
You didn't even know
your mother.

703
00:45:18,682 --> 00:45:21,317
You need to stop putting her
on a pedestal.

704
00:45:21,418 --> 00:45:23,553
Because she
wouldn't do anything.

705
00:45:23,654 --> 00:45:26,923
Do you understand?
You can stop that right now.

706
00:45:40,571 --> 00:45:42,271
<i>( cell phone ringing )</i>

707
00:45:48,979 --> 00:45:50,313
Hello.

708
00:45:50,414 --> 00:45:53,382
Uh... hi.
Julie?

709
00:45:55,953 --> 00:45:57,320
Martin?

710
00:45:57,421 --> 00:45:58,721
<i>Yeah.</i>

711
00:45:58,822 --> 00:46:01,157
Look, I'm sorry
to call you this late.

712
00:46:01,258 --> 00:46:03,059
I was just...

713
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:05,520
I was hoping that maybe we could
get together and talk?

714
00:46:05,596 --> 00:46:09,465
Martin, I don't think
that's a really good idea.

715
00:46:09,566 --> 00:46:11,686
Bruce had to take Sam
down to the station.

716
00:46:11,735 --> 00:46:13,269
<i>I know, I just, um...</i>

717
00:46:15,339 --> 00:46:18,040
I don't have anybody
to talk to right now.

718
00:46:18,142 --> 00:46:22,278
And I, um...
I just need somebody to talk to.

719
00:46:24,414 --> 00:46:25,715
Please.

720
00:46:27,518 --> 00:46:28,918
Okay.

721
00:46:29,019 --> 00:46:31,888
I guess I can get away
for an hour or so.

722
00:46:31,989 --> 00:46:33,756
Where should we meet?

723
00:46:33,857 --> 00:46:35,324
<i>( engine turns over )</i>

724
00:46:37,161 --> 00:46:39,095
<i>( vehicle departs )</i>

725
00:47:00,851 --> 00:47:03,186
<i>( ringing )</i>

726
00:47:05,956 --> 00:47:07,223
Hi, Tess.

727
00:47:07,324 --> 00:47:10,726
<i>Natalie, what's up?</i>

728
00:47:10,828 --> 00:47:13,095
I'm sorry that I've
been acting so weird.

729
00:47:13,197 --> 00:47:16,232
I just don't have anyone else
that I can talk to now.

730
00:47:16,333 --> 00:47:18,134
And...

731
00:47:18,235 --> 00:47:21,103
I'm really scared.
I need your help.

732
00:47:21,205 --> 00:47:22,872
<i>Okay, what do you need?</i>

733
00:47:44,895 --> 00:47:46,739
You had a nicer car
in high school.

734
00:47:46,763 --> 00:47:48,130
( laughs )

735
00:47:56,473 --> 00:47:59,308
I was worried we were gonna run
into some kids out here.

736
00:47:59,409 --> 00:48:02,278
I don't think these kids use it
the same way we used to.

737
00:48:02,379 --> 00:48:04,380
( chuckles )

738
00:48:04,481 --> 00:48:07,950
Not when they have
a basement and a comfy couch.

739
00:48:08,051 --> 00:48:09,752
Martin...

740
00:48:09,853 --> 00:48:11,087
I'm sorry...

741
00:48:11,188 --> 00:48:13,166
No, I'm sorry, it was my house.

742
00:48:13,190 --> 00:48:15,258
Julie, I didn't ask you here
to talk about that.

743
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:16,792
I... I promise.

744
00:48:18,528 --> 00:48:22,598
So... is everything okay?

745
00:48:22,699 --> 00:48:24,667
Is Natalie okay?

746
00:48:24,768 --> 00:48:28,738
Yeah, yeah, Natalie's...

747
00:48:28,839 --> 00:48:31,240
No.

748
00:48:31,341 --> 00:48:32,875
Everything's not okay.

749
00:48:40,117 --> 00:48:44,120
When Natalie
just started walking...

750
00:48:44,221 --> 00:48:45,381
Sarah decided that she wanted

751
00:48:45,455 --> 00:48:49,358
to do something... different.

752
00:48:49,459 --> 00:48:51,894
She said that being a mom
was harder than she thought.

753
00:48:51,995 --> 00:48:54,730
So she just wanted
to try something new.

754
00:48:57,634 --> 00:49:00,536
So she started taking these
pottery classes up in Walden

755
00:49:00,637 --> 00:49:03,773
every Thursday
from 5:00 to 6:00.

756
00:49:03,874 --> 00:49:06,208
And every few weeks
she'd bring home a new vase

757
00:49:06,310 --> 00:49:10,046
or a bowl or something, and...

758
00:49:10,147 --> 00:49:12,648
I'd say, "Wow, honey, this looks
really great," you know?

759
00:49:12,749 --> 00:49:14,183
"You're doing so good.

760
00:49:14,284 --> 00:49:16,118
We should look into getting
a kiln

761
00:49:16,219 --> 00:49:18,654
put in the house for you,"
you know?

762
00:49:18,755 --> 00:49:21,457
I just wanted her
to feel good about something.

763
00:49:21,558 --> 00:49:26,028
I wanted to feel proud
about something.

764
00:49:26,129 --> 00:49:29,131
So this one week, she came home

765
00:49:29,232 --> 00:49:32,401
with this really
pretty yellow vase.

766
00:49:32,502 --> 00:49:35,638
And she said she thought
it would look beautiful

767
00:49:35,739 --> 00:49:37,506
in the window
with some sunflowers in it.

768
00:49:37,607 --> 00:49:39,208
So the next morning, I did that.

769
00:49:39,309 --> 00:49:42,078
I went and got some sunflowers,
and I put them in the vase,

770
00:49:42,179 --> 00:49:43,813
and I put it on the window.

771
00:49:43,914 --> 00:49:45,181
And she was right.

772
00:49:45,282 --> 00:49:48,584
I mean, it looked beautiful.

773
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:52,054
( chuckles )

774
00:49:52,155 --> 00:49:54,156
Later that day when Natalie
got home from school,

775
00:49:54,257 --> 00:49:55,802
she had a friend over
and they were rough-housing,

776
00:49:55,826 --> 00:49:58,060
and they knocked the vase,
and it fell off the window

777
00:49:58,161 --> 00:50:01,497
and it hit the kitchen floor
and shattered into 1,000 pieces.

778
00:50:01,565 --> 00:50:04,266
So... I was mad.

779
00:50:06,803 --> 00:50:10,773
Kept thinking,
"What am I going to tell Sarah?"

780
00:50:10,874 --> 00:50:12,508
She's going to be so upset.

781
00:50:12,609 --> 00:50:14,143
She worked so hard
on this thing.

782
00:50:17,114 --> 00:50:20,549
Started cleaning it up,
and when I was done.

783
00:50:20,650 --> 00:50:23,786
I saw this
one little shard left.

784
00:50:23,887 --> 00:50:25,755
I picked it up,
and I turn it over,

785
00:50:25,856 --> 00:50:27,690
and it had this sticker on it.

786
00:50:27,791 --> 00:50:31,560
The sticker said "$9.99."

787
00:50:31,661 --> 00:50:34,096
( sighs )

788
00:50:36,466 --> 00:50:40,002
At least she got
a good deal on it.

789
00:50:40,103 --> 00:50:41,837
It was a really pretty vase.

790
00:50:46,343 --> 00:50:49,278
You know that place
the Pink Motel up on Route 14?

791
00:50:49,379 --> 00:50:53,516
Real flashy one with the,
yeah, the big neon sign?

792
00:50:56,053 --> 00:50:58,454
When I first saw the guy...

793
00:51:01,291 --> 00:51:03,359
I was actually disappointed.

794
00:51:06,430 --> 00:51:08,664
I guess I just expected him
to be this young,

795
00:51:08,765 --> 00:51:10,566
slick kid, you know, but...

796
00:51:13,270 --> 00:51:17,673
Maybe I thought it'd help
make sense of everything?

797
00:51:17,774 --> 00:51:19,275
But he was just this guy.

798
00:51:19,376 --> 00:51:23,145
He was like this...
normal guy,

799
00:51:23,246 --> 00:51:24,814
this average guy.

800
00:51:26,883 --> 00:51:28,751
Did you confront Sarah?

801
00:51:30,787 --> 00:51:34,657
Yeah, she said
that he made her happy.

802
00:51:34,758 --> 00:51:36,702
And that she was ready
to run off with him.

803
00:51:36,726 --> 00:51:37,993
But then, uh...

804
00:51:39,763 --> 00:51:41,497
She got sick.

805
00:51:43,366 --> 00:51:45,745
Does Natalie know
about any of this?

806
00:51:45,769 --> 00:51:48,437
No. I, uh...
I figured it was hard enough

807
00:51:48,538 --> 00:51:50,272
being raised without a mother,

808
00:51:50,373 --> 00:51:54,510
so I didn't wanna give her
any... bad memories, but...

809
00:51:58,048 --> 00:51:59,281
The point is...

810
00:52:01,251 --> 00:52:05,921
I wasn't enough for Sarah.

811
00:52:06,022 --> 00:52:07,356
She needed more.

812
00:52:10,927 --> 00:52:12,728
And what if Natalie
needs her mother now

813
00:52:12,829 --> 00:52:14,230
and there's nothing I can do?

814
00:52:14,331 --> 00:52:17,967
I mean, what if I can't do
anything about it?

815
00:52:18,068 --> 00:52:19,869
What if I'm not enough?

816
00:52:23,740 --> 00:52:27,143
You're the strongest man
I've ever known.

817
00:52:27,244 --> 00:52:29,178
The strongest.

818
00:52:29,246 --> 00:52:31,806
And you have all this love
that you share.

819
00:52:35,785 --> 00:52:38,921
I just want to take care of her,
you know?

820
00:52:39,022 --> 00:52:40,990
It's all I've ever known
how to do.

821
00:52:41,091 --> 00:52:44,193
And if I can't do that, then...

822
00:52:44,294 --> 00:52:45,995
I mean, who am I?

823
00:52:51,635 --> 00:52:53,335
Natalie's gonna be okay.

824
00:53:29,372 --> 00:53:31,173
Are you gonna tell your dad?

825
00:53:35,478 --> 00:53:38,380
No.

826
00:53:38,481 --> 00:53:40,082
He's been acting
like a crazy person.

827
00:53:40,183 --> 00:53:41,517
I can't talk to him.

828
00:53:44,321 --> 00:53:46,355
I gotta do this by myself.

829
00:53:48,825 --> 00:53:51,393
What about Sam?

830
00:53:51,494 --> 00:53:53,562
I don't even know
if he likes me.

831
00:53:56,333 --> 00:53:57,643
Especially
with how I've been acting

832
00:53:57,667 --> 00:53:59,835
with everything
going on right now.

833
00:54:03,873 --> 00:54:06,433
Don't you think you ought
to figure that out first?

834
00:54:07,644 --> 00:54:09,511
Go talk to him, Natalie.

835
00:54:20,357 --> 00:54:22,735
And...
if you don't think

836
00:54:22,759 --> 00:54:25,319
it'll work out
between you two...

837
00:54:26,696 --> 00:54:28,430
there is another option.

838
00:54:32,235 --> 00:54:34,637
Natalie?

839
00:54:34,738 --> 00:54:36,015
Where you going?

840
00:54:36,039 --> 00:54:37,606
<i>I'm getting a ride to school.</i>

841
00:54:37,707 --> 00:54:39,441
What?! Wh...

842
00:55:14,311 --> 00:55:16,489
So you're finally ready to talk?

843
00:55:16,513 --> 00:55:18,514
Yeah.

844
00:55:18,615 --> 00:55:20,916
Look, I'm sorry
that I've been avoiding you.

845
00:55:21,017 --> 00:55:23,385
I was... I was just
really embarrassed

846
00:55:23,486 --> 00:55:25,954
about breaking up the party
and I kind of figured

847
00:55:26,056 --> 00:55:27,856
that you were mad at me anyway.

848
00:55:27,957 --> 00:55:30,926
No, I don't care
about the party.

849
00:55:31,027 --> 00:55:33,929
I spent all of yesterday
at the police station

850
00:55:34,030 --> 00:55:35,464
being questioned for rape.

851
00:55:37,334 --> 00:55:39,178
- What did you tell them?
- I didn't tell them anything.

852
00:55:39,202 --> 00:55:41,437
- You should.
- What do you want me to say?

853
00:55:41,538 --> 00:55:43,272
The truth?

854
00:55:43,373 --> 00:55:46,175
I mean, we were both
really tanked, right?

855
00:55:48,478 --> 00:55:51,146
Right.

856
00:55:51,247 --> 00:55:54,083
Look, I'm not like you.

857
00:55:54,184 --> 00:55:57,286
I'm not going to get
into college on my grades.

858
00:55:57,387 --> 00:55:59,131
I need this hockey scholarship.

859
00:55:59,155 --> 00:56:01,715
If the coach at Boulder hears
even one word about it...

860
00:56:03,727 --> 00:56:06,095
it's gone.

861
00:56:06,196 --> 00:56:09,431
Look...

862
00:56:09,532 --> 00:56:13,402
we will make sure
that everyone knows

863
00:56:13,503 --> 00:56:16,538
this isn't true, okay?

864
00:56:37,627 --> 00:56:39,495
What's going on
with you this morning?

865
00:56:39,596 --> 00:56:40,876
Nothing.

866
00:56:44,701 --> 00:56:46,702
What the hell is that?

867
00:56:48,838 --> 00:56:51,840
- You don't think, uh...
- Yeah, I don't know.

868
00:56:57,614 --> 00:56:59,848
I left you a message
this morning.

869
00:56:59,949 --> 00:57:01,861
Well, we didn't get your message

870
00:57:01,885 --> 00:57:03,863
because we were driving here
to work.

871
00:57:03,887 --> 00:57:05,364
So would you please just tell us

872
00:57:05,388 --> 00:57:06,955
what's going on right now?

873
00:57:07,056 --> 00:57:08,601
I've decided to take the project

874
00:57:08,625 --> 00:57:10,192
in a different direction.

875
00:57:10,293 --> 00:57:13,462
You decided to change the plans
that you approved of,

876
00:57:13,563 --> 00:57:15,631
that we started working on

877
00:57:15,732 --> 00:57:18,013
because you weren't happy
with what we were doing?

878
00:57:18,067 --> 00:57:20,335
- Is that it?
- Martin. Martin.

879
00:57:20,437 --> 00:57:22,571
We've got the contract.
We'll lose him.

880
00:57:22,672 --> 00:57:24,039
We'll sue these guys.

881
00:57:24,140 --> 00:57:26,375
I wouldn't recommend that.

882
00:57:26,476 --> 00:57:28,154
That's right,
you wouldn't advise it

883
00:57:28,178 --> 00:57:30,122
because you have such great
representation,

884
00:57:30,146 --> 00:57:31,624
- isn't that right?
- It's not worth it.

885
00:57:31,648 --> 00:57:34,216
Come on, come on.

886
00:57:34,317 --> 00:57:36,717
Hey, good luck working
for this pig.

887
00:57:51,334 --> 00:57:53,335
Holy smokes.

888
00:57:53,436 --> 00:57:55,181
For a moment there,
I thought you were actually

889
00:57:55,205 --> 00:57:56,472
gonna take him out.

890
00:57:58,374 --> 00:57:59,808
<i>( engine turns over )</i>

891
00:58:02,345 --> 00:58:03,445
<i>( engine stops )</i>

892
00:58:05,482 --> 00:58:07,683
Did you know?

893
00:58:07,784 --> 00:58:10,385
What, we were gonna
get fired today?

894
00:58:10,487 --> 00:58:12,421
- How could I possibly...
- About Sarah.

895
00:58:14,924 --> 00:58:16,892
- What about her?
- She was your sister.

896
00:58:16,993 --> 00:58:18,504
She must have told
you something.

897
00:58:18,528 --> 00:58:21,088
She must have confided in you.
Did she...

898
00:58:21,130 --> 00:58:23,690
Did she tell you anything?
Did you know?

899
00:58:25,301 --> 00:58:27,069
What are you talking about?

900
00:58:32,375 --> 00:58:34,119
Nothing.
I'm gonna drive you home.

901
00:58:34,143 --> 00:58:35,677
<i>( engine turns over )</i>

902
00:58:38,381 --> 00:58:41,049
Sam: <i>Yeah, the problem
with that is Coach Cran</i>

903
00:58:41,150 --> 00:58:42,761
needs the gymnasium every day

904
00:58:42,785 --> 00:58:45,521
from 3:00 to 6:00 PM
for basketball practice.

905
00:58:45,622 --> 00:58:47,289
So...

906
00:58:47,390 --> 00:58:51,193
<i>I guess we'll look
into other venue options.</i>

907
00:58:51,294 --> 00:58:53,254
That's a good meeting
today, guys.

908
00:59:14,851 --> 00:59:15,851
Natalie, they'll talk.

909
00:59:15,919 --> 00:59:17,819
Yeah.

910
00:59:17,921 --> 00:59:20,366
They'll talk about how Natalie
and Sam are all over each other.

911
00:59:20,390 --> 00:59:22,057
That's the idea.

912
00:59:22,158 --> 00:59:25,627
I mean, we need to show them
that nothing's wrong, right?

913
00:59:27,263 --> 00:59:30,365
So...
I'm your girlfriend now.

914
00:59:30,466 --> 00:59:31,746
Okay?

915
00:59:34,203 --> 00:59:36,605
My dad would kill me if he knew
I was even talking to you.

916
00:59:36,706 --> 00:59:40,609
This isn't about them.
It's about us.

917
00:59:40,710 --> 00:59:45,113
I really need you to be with me
on this one.

918
00:59:45,214 --> 00:59:46,494
Okay, Sam?

919
00:59:50,186 --> 00:59:51,753
Are you with me?

920
01:00:04,934 --> 01:00:08,870
( laughs ) Uh-oh.

921
01:00:08,972 --> 01:00:12,841
Looks like the student council's
here to bust us.

922
01:00:12,942 --> 01:00:15,220
No one cares about you, Kalie.

923
01:00:15,244 --> 01:00:17,764
Didn't you figure that out when
the president dumped your ass?

924
01:00:19,382 --> 01:00:22,851
I heard you spent a night
in the hospital, Parish.

925
01:00:22,952 --> 01:00:24,519
Yeah?

926
01:00:24,621 --> 01:00:26,588
What was that like?

927
01:00:26,689 --> 01:00:29,291
The food sucked.

928
01:00:39,802 --> 01:00:42,137
<i>( telephone rings )</i>

929
01:00:45,541 --> 01:00:47,142
Mr. Cahill will see you now.

930
01:01:05,795 --> 01:01:09,464
Martin, what's on your mind?

931
01:01:11,701 --> 01:01:13,802
James Woodrow fired me today.

932
01:01:15,805 --> 01:01:18,106
I'm sorry to hear that.

933
01:01:21,144 --> 01:01:24,846
I don't believe that's the first
time that you're hearing of it.

934
01:01:24,947 --> 01:01:28,383
What are you insinuating?

935
01:01:28,484 --> 01:01:30,018
I think you're punishing me.

936
01:01:30,119 --> 01:01:32,254
I'm the one
who got you that job.

937
01:01:32,355 --> 01:01:36,224
Which means it would be just
as easy to take it from me.

938
01:01:36,325 --> 01:01:38,427
Bruce, I understand
you might be upset with me...

939
01:01:38,528 --> 01:01:42,898
I-I might be upset
about what?

940
01:01:42,999 --> 01:01:46,368
I had my concerns
about Natalie and Sam.

941
01:01:46,469 --> 01:01:48,970
I... I called the police.

942
01:01:49,072 --> 01:01:51,573
<i>I just wanted them
to look into it, that's all.</i>

943
01:01:51,674 --> 01:01:53,408
And so you think this is what?

944
01:01:53,509 --> 01:01:57,045
You accuse my son of rape,
and then I take away your job?

945
01:01:57,146 --> 01:02:00,082
Bruce, I need the money.

946
01:02:00,183 --> 01:02:01,616
I need it.

947
01:02:01,718 --> 01:02:03,719
I'm sure.

948
01:02:03,820 --> 01:02:05,954
You'll find other work.

949
01:02:06,055 --> 01:02:08,890
But it seems like you're
no longer welcome in Deer Hills.

950
01:02:20,536 --> 01:02:22,804
Can I just ask you
one more question?

951
01:02:27,577 --> 01:02:29,511
Did you buy them the liquor?

952
01:02:29,612 --> 01:02:31,847
Or are you just such
a generous parent

953
01:02:31,948 --> 01:02:35,817
that you let them have some
out of your own personal stash?

954
01:02:35,918 --> 01:02:37,252
We're back to this again?

955
01:02:37,353 --> 01:02:38,864
Your daughter
can't hold her alcohol,

956
01:02:38,888 --> 01:02:40,532
and that makes me a bad guy
because I'm not

957
01:02:40,556 --> 01:02:42,824
overbearing like you,
because I don't keep tabs

958
01:02:42,925 --> 01:02:44,570
on my kid's every single move?

959
01:02:44,594 --> 01:02:46,661
Maybe if you did,
then my daughter...

960
01:02:46,763 --> 01:02:49,698
Your daughter what?
Natalie is fine! She's fine!

961
01:02:49,799 --> 01:02:51,266
<i>You're the one losing it!</i>

962
01:02:53,569 --> 01:02:55,280
You want to know why
you lost your job?

963
01:02:55,304 --> 01:02:57,382
Woodrow says that ever
since your daughter got sick,

964
01:02:57,406 --> 01:02:59,351
you've been screwing up,
making mistakes,

965
01:02:59,375 --> 01:03:01,176
<i>working half-pace.</i>

966
01:03:01,277 --> 01:03:02,944
( laughs )

967
01:03:03,045 --> 01:03:05,480
He says your half-wit
brother-in-law

968
01:03:05,581 --> 01:03:07,626
is the only one holding
the thing together.

969
01:03:07,650 --> 01:03:09,551
And still I stood up for you.

970
01:03:09,652 --> 01:03:11,386
Until yesterday.

971
01:03:11,487 --> 01:03:13,567
<i>I'm sorry
if I was no longer so forgiving</i>

972
01:03:13,656 --> 01:03:15,701
after I spent an entire day
listening to my son

973
01:03:15,725 --> 01:03:17,859
defend himself to the police.

974
01:03:17,960 --> 01:03:21,530
Yeah, I'm sure you were plenty
helpful in his defense...

975
01:03:21,631 --> 01:03:23,008
Don't you point
your fingers at me

976
01:03:23,032 --> 01:03:24,952
because your daughter's a slut!

977
01:04:10,246 --> 01:04:12,547
Hey! Hey!

978
01:04:16,252 --> 01:04:17,529
You stay away from her,
you hear me?!

979
01:04:17,553 --> 01:04:18,833
What are you doing?

980
01:04:18,921 --> 01:04:20,689
- Natalie, get in the truck.
- No.

981
01:04:20,790 --> 01:04:21,957
Get in the truck!

982
01:04:22,058 --> 01:04:23,925
<i>Go!</i>

983
01:04:29,232 --> 01:04:31,766
<i>I just don't want you
hanging out with Sam Cahill!</i>

984
01:04:31,868 --> 01:04:34,246
- Why?
- Because he's no good,
just like his father.

985
01:04:34,270 --> 01:04:36,181
- You don't even know him.
- I know enough.

986
01:04:36,205 --> 01:04:38,607
- You don't know anything!
- What did you just say?

987
01:04:38,708 --> 01:04:41,009
I said you don't know anything!

988
01:04:41,110 --> 01:04:43,812
And you are a horrible father!
I wish that you would die!

989
01:04:43,913 --> 01:04:45,858
I wish you died,
and I still had my mom!

990
01:04:45,882 --> 01:04:48,042
- You never had a mom!
- What is that supposed to mean?

991
01:04:48,084 --> 01:04:50,552
It means your mom was
at the Pink Motel

992
01:04:50,653 --> 01:04:52,787
busy with her boyfriend!

993
01:04:52,889 --> 01:04:55,023
So busy she couldn't
raise her own daughter!

994
01:05:00,296 --> 01:05:01,596
What?

995
01:05:07,770 --> 01:05:09,571
She was going to leave us,
Natalie.

996
01:05:13,276 --> 01:05:15,477
Why wouldn't you tell me?

997
01:05:15,578 --> 01:05:18,380
Natalie, you didn't need to know
about all that stuff, okay?

998
01:05:18,481 --> 01:05:20,815
I wanted you to feel loved,
like you had a good mother.

999
01:05:20,917 --> 01:05:23,262
Well, I needed a father,
and you lied.

1000
01:05:23,286 --> 01:05:26,221
I didn't... I was...
Look, I was just scared, okay?

1001
01:05:26,322 --> 01:05:28,556
<i>- Of what?</i>
- Of<i> what?!</i>

1002
01:05:28,658 --> 01:05:31,993
What? Say it.

1003
01:05:32,094 --> 01:05:34,306
Say it!
Say it, Dad.

1004
01:05:34,330 --> 01:05:35,497
Say what?

1005
01:05:35,598 --> 01:05:37,309
You were scared
that if I found out,

1006
01:05:37,333 --> 01:05:38,911
I would turn out just like her.

1007
01:05:38,935 --> 01:05:41,770
Don't you say that!
That's not true!

1008
01:05:41,871 --> 01:05:43,505
Guess what, Daddy.

1009
01:05:43,606 --> 01:05:46,508
Your whore daughter already
got herself knocked up!

1010
01:05:46,609 --> 01:05:49,344
( panting )

1011
01:05:51,514 --> 01:05:53,081
What?

1012
01:05:56,619 --> 01:05:57,652
Okay.

1013
01:06:01,057 --> 01:06:02,924
Why didn't you say something?

1014
01:06:03,025 --> 01:06:04,926
- Why didn't you...
- Tell you?

1015
01:06:05,027 --> 01:06:07,662
Yeah, why didn't you tell me?

1016
01:06:07,763 --> 01:06:11,333
That is a great question
coming from you right now.

1017
01:06:16,038 --> 01:06:17,638
All right, here's what
we're going to do.

1018
01:06:22,378 --> 01:06:23,989
We're going to talk about this.
We're going to figure this out...

1019
01:06:24,013 --> 01:06:26,191
I think that you have
made it very clear

1020
01:06:26,215 --> 01:06:29,250
that we have needed
to talk about a lot of things

1021
01:06:29,352 --> 01:06:32,120
for a long time.

1022
01:06:32,221 --> 01:06:34,389
But it is too late.

1023
01:07:20,036 --> 01:07:23,038
Hi, Sam. Um...

1024
01:07:23,139 --> 01:07:25,140
I think I need a place to stay.

1025
01:07:25,241 --> 01:07:29,611
<i>Um... Yeah, sure.</i>

1026
01:07:29,712 --> 01:07:31,112
( winces )

1027
01:07:59,442 --> 01:08:01,709
I'm sorry that my dad
attacked you.

1028
01:08:04,480 --> 01:08:05,760
It's okay.

1029
01:08:08,417 --> 01:08:10,819
Are you?

1030
01:08:10,920 --> 01:08:12,480
- Hmm?
- Okay?

1031
01:08:14,723 --> 01:08:16,624
I need to ask you something.

1032
01:08:22,264 --> 01:08:23,665
Do you regret it?

1033
01:08:29,004 --> 01:08:30,371
No.

1034
01:08:33,109 --> 01:08:36,511
I mean, I wish it had worked out
differently afterwards.

1035
01:08:38,447 --> 01:08:41,007
But I really like you, Natalie.

1036
01:08:44,653 --> 01:08:47,422
I need to...

1037
01:08:47,523 --> 01:08:49,257
I need to tell you something.

1038
01:08:52,862 --> 01:08:54,362
I'm pregnant.

1039
01:09:02,037 --> 01:09:03,972
Sam:
<i>What do we do?</i>

1040
01:09:07,476 --> 01:09:08,843
I don't know.

1041
01:09:16,719 --> 01:09:18,319
Thank you.

1042
01:09:18,420 --> 01:09:21,356
For what?

1043
01:09:21,457 --> 01:09:23,324
Saying "we."

1044
01:09:33,936 --> 01:09:35,503
Hey, sweetie.

1045
01:09:37,740 --> 01:09:39,240
What's up?

1046
01:09:39,341 --> 01:09:42,777
Natalie Parish is here.

1047
01:09:42,878 --> 01:09:46,391
No, so she can't
be here, Julie.
She needs to leave.

1048
01:09:46,415 --> 01:09:49,083
Bruce... she's pregnant.

1049
01:09:49,185 --> 01:09:51,819
( exclaims )

1050
01:09:51,921 --> 01:09:54,923
<i>These kids,
they're both so confused.</i>

1051
01:09:55,024 --> 01:09:56,758
They need help.

1052
01:09:56,859 --> 01:09:58,670
We should call Martin
so that we can all sit down

1053
01:09:58,694 --> 01:09:59,994
and discuss this.

1054
01:10:00,095 --> 01:10:02,174
No, we let them cool
off for a minute.

1055
01:10:02,198 --> 01:10:10,198
I'll handle Martin.
First, I want to talk to my son.

1056
01:10:18,347 --> 01:10:19,881
Sammy.

1057
01:10:21,050 --> 01:10:22,217
Have a seat.

1058
01:10:29,925 --> 01:10:32,860
So Natalie's
spending the night, huh?

1059
01:10:32,962 --> 01:10:34,562
Yeah.

1060
01:10:34,663 --> 01:10:37,008
I know you don't want me
talking to her dad.

1061
01:10:37,032 --> 01:10:39,734
It's just... complicated.

1062
01:10:39,835 --> 01:10:41,936
Because she's pregnant.

1063
01:10:44,440 --> 01:10:46,474
Your mom overheard.

1064
01:10:52,781 --> 01:10:54,349
You're a good guy.

1065
01:10:54,450 --> 01:10:56,184
You care about this girl?

1066
01:10:59,121 --> 01:11:00,355
Yeah.

1067
01:11:00,456 --> 01:11:01,723
Good.

1068
01:11:03,726 --> 01:11:06,461
Because you and Natalie both
have bright futures ahead of you

1069
01:11:06,562 --> 01:11:08,296
if you make
the right decision now,

1070
01:11:08,397 --> 01:11:11,966
if you nip this thing in the bud
before it's too late.

1071
01:11:12,067 --> 01:11:13,801
What do you mean?

1072
01:11:13,902 --> 01:11:15,814
Well, there's a clinic
in Milltown.

1073
01:11:15,838 --> 01:11:17,716
You're going to take Natalie
first thing in the morning,

1074
01:11:17,740 --> 01:11:19,407
and they'll take care of it.

1075
01:11:19,508 --> 01:11:20,908
It's early enough.

1076
01:11:21,010 --> 01:11:24,112
Quick and easy,
like it never even happened.

1077
01:11:24,213 --> 01:11:27,548
Dad... I don't know
if that's what she wants.

1078
01:11:27,650 --> 01:11:28,983
<i>Sam!</i>

1079
01:11:29,084 --> 01:11:31,164
<i>That girl doesn't know
what she wants.</i>

1080
01:11:31,253 --> 01:11:33,821
It's up to you to convince her
to do what's right.

1081
01:11:33,922 --> 01:11:35,790
What about Mr. Parish?

1082
01:11:35,891 --> 01:11:38,393
Doesn't he have to give
permission or something?

1083
01:11:38,494 --> 01:11:40,238
<i>Legally, he's gotta be notified.</i>

1084
01:11:40,262 --> 01:11:42,230
But there's something called
a judicial bypass.

1085
01:11:42,331 --> 01:11:43,965
You don't have
to worry about that.

1086
01:11:44,066 --> 01:11:45,500
I'll take care of that.

1087
01:11:48,871 --> 01:11:50,471
Do you understand?

1088
01:12:12,728 --> 01:12:15,040
Natalie, I know that you're
really angry with me right now,

1089
01:12:15,064 --> 01:12:18,099
but if you would please just...
let me in,

1090
01:12:18,200 --> 01:12:20,280
I know we can get
through this together.

1091
01:12:22,938 --> 01:12:24,372
Natalie, please?

1092
01:12:28,711 --> 01:12:30,044
Natalie?

1093
01:12:45,027 --> 01:12:47,528
- Come on!
- <i>( engine turns over )</i>

1094
01:12:49,465 --> 01:12:51,265
<i>( tires squeal )</i>

1095
01:13:37,112 --> 01:13:39,881
Natalie!

1096
01:13:39,982 --> 01:13:41,015
Natalie!

1097
01:13:45,454 --> 01:13:47,789
Martin, are you out
of your mind?

1098
01:13:47,890 --> 01:13:49,957
- Where is she?!
- Get off my property.

1099
01:13:50,058 --> 01:13:52,360
- Bruce!
- Go back inside.

1100
01:13:52,461 --> 01:13:55,096
You didn't tell him?
You said you talked it over.

1101
01:13:55,197 --> 01:13:57,565
Talked what over?
Bruce, what did you do?

1102
01:13:57,666 --> 01:13:59,600
I gave our kids a solution.

1103
01:14:01,904 --> 01:14:03,648
Julie, please.
Where are they?

1104
01:14:03,672 --> 01:14:05,473
Julie, don't!

1105
01:14:07,109 --> 01:14:09,343
The clinic in Milltown.

1106
01:14:13,615 --> 01:14:14,982
Marty...

1107
01:14:26,595 --> 01:14:28,930
<i>There's no operation involved.</i>

1108
01:14:29,031 --> 01:14:30,708
<i>What I am gonna do
is prescribe you</i>

1109
01:14:30,732 --> 01:14:32,700
<i>two oral medications.</i>

1110
01:14:32,801 --> 01:14:34,712
The first is called
mifepristone.

1111
01:14:34,736 --> 01:14:36,804
<i>That one you take immediately.</i>

1112
01:14:36,905 --> 01:14:39,507
And what that does is break down
the walls of your uterus

1113
01:14:39,608 --> 01:14:42,477
so that the pregnancy
can't effectively continue.

1114
01:14:42,578 --> 01:14:45,713
<i>After that, you're gonna take
something called misoprostol.</i>

1115
01:14:45,814 --> 01:14:48,516
<i>Now, that one's gonna cause
some pain and some bleeding,</i>

1116
01:14:48,617 --> 01:14:50,518
<i>but that's totally normal.</i>

1117
01:15:12,374 --> 01:15:14,542
( crying )

1118
01:15:20,883 --> 01:15:24,252
<i>( engine turns over )</i>

1119
01:15:29,758 --> 01:15:31,659
I'm looking for my daughter.

1120
01:15:31,760 --> 01:15:33,594
Mr. Parish?

1121
01:15:33,695 --> 01:15:36,664
Sam, where is she?

1122
01:15:36,765 --> 01:15:39,767
Natalie Parish?
She left about 20 minutes ago.

1123
01:15:51,179 --> 01:15:52,446
She took my car.

1124
01:15:58,253 --> 01:16:02,590
Is there anywhere
that she would've gone
that you can think of?

1125
01:16:02,691 --> 01:16:04,025
No.

1126
01:16:07,296 --> 01:16:09,764
Call your mother, Sam.

1127
01:16:09,865 --> 01:16:11,576
No.
I'm coming with you.

1128
01:16:11,600 --> 01:16:13,560
<i>- ( door slams )
- No, you're not.</i>

1129
01:16:36,024 --> 01:16:38,292
Natalie!

1130
01:16:38,393 --> 01:16:40,061
Nat!

1131
01:16:51,840 --> 01:16:54,742
She's left for good, maybe.

1132
01:16:54,843 --> 01:16:56,577
Maybe this is what I deserve.

1133
01:16:58,747 --> 01:17:02,650
Mr. Parish, maybe she's just
off thinking somewhere.

1134
01:17:06,421 --> 01:17:09,824
Don't... don't...
Don't presume to know her, Sam,

1135
01:17:09,925 --> 01:17:11,826
or know where she is, okay?

1136
01:17:14,229 --> 01:17:16,664
You're just a kid.

1137
01:17:16,765 --> 01:17:20,501
Now move.
It's why you're going home.

1138
01:17:20,602 --> 01:17:23,104
I'm sorry, okay?

1139
01:17:23,205 --> 01:17:25,873
<i>I'm sorry this is happening!</i>

1140
01:17:25,974 --> 01:17:29,076
But I'm here!
I'm not running!

1141
01:17:31,046 --> 01:17:33,681
<i>We were just trying
to do the right thing!</i>

1142
01:17:33,782 --> 01:17:36,817
And Natalie was scared.

1143
01:17:36,918 --> 01:17:39,199
She said she didn't want
to end up like her mother.

1144
01:18:35,510 --> 01:18:37,011
This seat taken?

1145
01:18:47,656 --> 01:18:49,523
I remember this place.

1146
01:18:53,962 --> 01:18:55,329
You used to take me here

1147
01:18:55,430 --> 01:18:57,990
when you'd follow mom,
didn't you?

1148
01:19:02,137 --> 01:19:05,372
Natalie, my feelings about
your mother are...

1149
01:19:05,474 --> 01:19:07,641
complicated.

1150
01:19:10,479 --> 01:19:14,949
So you knew she was gonna
leave us.

1151
01:19:15,050 --> 01:19:16,717
But you stayed with her

1152
01:19:16,818 --> 01:19:19,420
the whole time in the hospital
whole time anyway.

1153
01:19:19,521 --> 01:19:21,055
( sighs )

1154
01:19:21,156 --> 01:19:25,126
When her boyfriend found out
that she was dying...

1155
01:19:25,227 --> 01:19:28,095
he left.

1156
01:19:28,196 --> 01:19:29,797
She didn't have anybody.

1157
01:19:32,467 --> 01:19:34,635
You've got a stupid big heart.

1158
01:19:37,639 --> 01:19:39,006
You know that, right?

1159
01:19:43,879 --> 01:19:45,646
But I shouldn't
have lied to you.

1160
01:19:48,350 --> 01:19:50,151
I just don't want you
to hate her.

1161
01:19:52,621 --> 01:19:54,021
Well, I don't hate her.

1162
01:19:56,691 --> 01:19:58,526
But I don't love her either.

1163
01:20:03,398 --> 01:20:06,267
I mean, how can you really
have any feelings

1164
01:20:06,368 --> 01:20:08,928
about someone that you
never really knew?

1165
01:20:12,073 --> 01:20:14,633
All I ever really knew was you.

1166
01:20:18,280 --> 01:20:21,448
( chuckles )
Bum luck.

1167
01:20:21,550 --> 01:20:24,110
At least you make good sundaes.

1168
01:20:33,962 --> 01:20:36,730
I think you might have
a date to the Winter Formal.

1169
01:20:45,774 --> 01:20:48,334
Do you think I'm throwing
my life away?

1170
01:20:50,979 --> 01:20:53,948
Nah, it's just a dance.

1171
01:20:54,049 --> 01:20:55,382
Dad.

1172
01:21:02,624 --> 01:21:04,825
Your future is just gonna be
as good or as bad

1173
01:21:04,926 --> 01:21:06,493
as you want it to be.

1174
01:21:06,595 --> 01:21:09,096
But what if I'm a bad mom?

1175
01:21:13,468 --> 01:21:14,635
You won't be.

1176
01:21:16,338 --> 01:21:17,638
That I'm certain of.

1177
01:22:13,261 --> 01:22:17,164
I have to take my car.

1178
01:22:17,265 --> 01:22:19,199
I'm sorry, I just...

1179
01:22:19,301 --> 01:22:21,802
It's fine.
I'm happy you're okay.

1180
01:22:26,541 --> 01:22:28,008
Thank you, Mr. Parish.

1181
01:22:50,332 --> 01:22:51,832
Daddy...

1182
01:22:55,403 --> 01:22:57,371
Just be careful.

1183
01:23:19,761 --> 01:23:21,762
( sighs )
