1
00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:24,890
So I'm telling you,
you should read comic books.

2
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:27,060
It's modern American literature.

3
00:00:27,350 --> 00:00:29,980
There's this guy who has this crazy dog,
or whatnot...

4
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:33,780
...that can do all kinds of crazy stuff
with all his robot parts.

5
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:39,570
Like, he can open cans, stop trains,
and reach through fences to pick flowers--

6
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:43,200
Oh, all that's a bunch of hoolarky.
Stay focused on your work.

7
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:46,000
We're supposed to be guarding
this convention, not reading the--

8
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:48,420
Huh?

9
00:00:50,290 --> 00:00:51,340
Somebody there?

10
00:00:56,680 --> 00:01:00,930
Yo, friend, the convention starts
tomorrow. You ain't supposed to be in here.

11
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:08,020
Careful, Jimmy.

12
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:15,030
Tommy? What?

13
00:01:31,210 --> 00:01:32,340
Ugh.

14
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:33,880
No...

15
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:12,310
I'm telling you, Scooby-Doo, buddy, old pal,
like, the Blue Falcon is the greatest. Ho, ho.

16
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:17,480
And don't forget Dynomutt, Dog Wonder.
He-he-he.

17
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:26,160
Okay, gang,
when Scooby, who we're using as bait...

18
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:29,910
...leads the manic Minotaur
of Manesly Manor into the trap...

19
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:33,170
...you girls pull the levers
while Shaggy and I pull the ropes.

20
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:34,500
All set?

21
00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:38,000
All except for the fact
that your bait is busy reading comics.

22
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:39,340
- Who's it?
- What's it?

23
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:42,420
Come on, Scooby.
We need the Minotaur to chase you.

24
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:46,340
Uh-uh. I don't wanna be the bait again.

25
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:48,350
Would you do it for a Scooby Snack?

26
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:50,310
Uh-uh. No way.

27
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:53,310
- Would you do it for two Scooby Snacks?
- Nope.

28
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:56,190
Would you do it
if Velma called you Dog Wonder?

29
00:03:56,350 --> 00:03:58,190
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay.

30
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:00,530
Huh?

31
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,030
Ugh.

32
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:06,160
Hmm?

33
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:08,200
Come on, Velma.

34
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:11,040
You wanna solve this mystery,
or don't you?

35
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,910
All right.

36
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,870
Dog Wonder, please be the bait.

37
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:18,040
What was that? I couldn't hear you.

38
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:22,630
Please, Dog Wonder. Go do your job.

39
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,130
I'm Scooby-Don, Dog Wonder.

40
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:28,890
Dog Wonder, Wonder, Wonder.

41
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:51,580
I'm Scooby-Don, Dog Wonder.
Wonder, Wonder, Wonder.

42
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:34,620
Wait for it.

43
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:36,620
And now.

44
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:51,180
- Huh?
- It's okay, Scooby-Don. You're safe now.

45
00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:54,510
It is my greatest honor and privilege...

46
00:05:54,680 --> 00:06:00,230
...to award you fine young adults
an honorary appreciation degree...

47
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:05,230
...for capturing the manic Minotaur
of Manesly Manor.

48
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:11,490
Shaggy, enough with the comics.
Pay attention. We're getting an award.

49
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:16,040
Blue Falcon.

50
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,580
And Dynomutt.

51
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:24,290
Yeah, do you guys think
you could unmask me now?

52
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:26,130
I've been hanging up here all night.

53
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:28,760
This net really chafes
in all the wrong places.

54
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,090
Sorry there, Mr. Bad Guy.

55
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:33,800
It takes a lot to plan these kind
of award ceremonies, apparently.

56
00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:37,680
Let's see who's really behind
all the computer thefts.

57
00:06:37,850 --> 00:06:39,850
Horten McGuggenhiem.

58
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:41,520
Yeah, yeah, like, big surprise.

59
00:06:41,690 --> 00:06:44,310
The geek with the glasses
was stealing all the computers.

60
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:46,020
Can we wrap this up now?

61
00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:49,110
I suppose you all wanna know
why I did it.

62
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,990
Well, it all started back in my childhoo--

63
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,530
Nope. No, we're good.

64
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:55,700
Don't need to know why.

65
00:06:55,870 --> 00:06:57,540
Like, take him away, officers.

66
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:00,620
Thanks for coming. Bye-bye.

67
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:05,960
- What's the big rush, Shaggy?
- We got things to do.

68
00:07:06,130 --> 00:07:08,550
- And places to go.
- Let me guess.

69
00:07:08,710 --> 00:07:12,470
Does this have something to do with you
being a comic-book geek and a TV addict?

70
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:13,680
Absolutely.

71
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:17,310
I mean, like, no. But we are going
to the Comic ConApalooza.

72
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:18,560
Hon, hon.

73
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,100
Held every July.

74
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:25,230
In the heart of beautiful
downtown San De Pedro in California.

75
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:27,900
So exciting.

76
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:34,490
- Hoo-hoo-hoo. Hurry.
- Fred, grab the wheel...

77
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:36,200
...and let's, like, hit the road.

78
00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:38,910
We can't be late, dude.

79
00:07:52,050 --> 00:07:54,090
Well, my trusty hound...

80
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:58,680
...it appears that our art show
has been a resounding success

81
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:01,600
It's the Falcon Flash.

82
00:08:02,810 --> 00:08:06,270
Ladies and gentlemen,
something unexpected has come up.

83
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:10,400
I'm afraid the an show is over.

84
00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:14,610
Not a moment to lose, Dog Wonder.
Quick, to the Falcon's Lair.

85
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:16,780
You got it, BF.

86
00:08:18,450 --> 00:08:20,410
Here we go.

87
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:31,550
Dynomutt, to the Falcon car.

88
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:34,090
Blue Falcon.

89
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:36,300
And Dog Wonder.

90
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:39,300
Away.

91
00:08:39,470 --> 00:08:41,640
The Blue Falcon is just so cool.

92
00:08:41,810 --> 00:08:44,480
Played to perfection
by the one and only...

93
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,140
...Owen Garrison.

94
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:49,110
And Dynomutt is so amazing.

95
00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:51,780
And our costumes are, like, groovy.

96
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:53,150
High four.

97
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:59,280
Wow, you two, I've never seen you so
excited over something that wasn't edible.

98
00:08:59,450 --> 00:09:01,620
Oh, it's edible.

99
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:05,620
Yeah. We made the costumes
out of string cheese and food coloring.

100
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:09,000
We'll be the Blue Falcon and Dynomutt...

101
00:09:09,170 --> 00:09:12,800
...for Mega Mondo Pop! Comic
ConApalooza costume contest.

102
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,590
And when it's over...

103
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,840
We eat the costumes.

104
00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:20,180
- It's like two-for-one fun.
- It's something.

105
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:24,470
We are gonna win that costume contest,
buddy, old pal.

106
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:32,360
I'm Dynomutt, Dog Wonder.

107
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,540
I don't know, guys.

108
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:48,500
That old Blue Falcon TV show
was pretty campy.

109
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:51,130
But I gotta say,
I'm really looking forward...

110
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:55,260
...to the screening of the new, updated,
darker, edgier Blue Falcon movie...

111
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:58,380
...featuring mega movie star,
Brad Adams.

112
00:09:58,550 --> 00:10:01,180
He's cute
in a dark, brooding kind of way.

113
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:04,390
But you know what's even cuter?
Littlest Fuzzies.

114
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:07,390
They're only the cutest collectibles
in the whole wide world.

115
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:09,520
And I have an almost complete collection.

116
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:12,860
I've printed a checklist
of all the various Fuzzies I own...

117
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:17,400
...so I'll know exactly which ones to buy at
the Mega Mondo Pop! Comic ConApalooza.

118
00:10:17,570 --> 00:10:18,650
Please.

119
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:24,080
Costume competitions, movie premieres,
obnoxiously cute collectibles. Ugh.

120
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,620
I'm glad the convention
is supposed to be haunted...

121
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:28,750
...by a horrible, mean, cruel monster-man.

122
00:10:29,210 --> 00:10:30,670
Monster-man?

123
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,330
Yup. See?

124
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:35,840
These two guards said
a crazy freak attacked them in the dark.

125
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,170
- Smells like a mystery.
- No.

126
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:42,760
It smells like a whole lot of Velma trying to
ruin the most important weekend of my life.

127
00:10:42,890 --> 00:10:44,430
But that's not happening.

128
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,600
Nope. No way.

129
00:10:47,770 --> 00:10:52,520
You can use the laptop
after the convention. Hoo, hoo.

130
00:10:53,270 --> 00:10:58,110
Well, it looks like the world can rest easy
once again, Dynomutt.

131
00:10:58,280 --> 00:10:59,820
That's right, BF.

132
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:01,780
And remember, kids...

133
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:06,410
...it's the hero inside of you
that saves the day.

134
00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:13,250
Like, welcome to the Mega
Mondo Pop! Comic ConApalooza.

135
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:19,880
The greatest collection of comic books,
TV shows, movies, everything.

136
00:11:25,930 --> 00:11:28,470
Jinkies. The mystery's started already.

137
00:11:33,650 --> 00:11:35,270
It's the Crab Car.

138
00:11:36,650 --> 00:11:38,730
I love it. I love it.

139
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:40,900
Hmm?

140
00:11:41,070 --> 00:11:46,160
I can see the only mystery around here
is why I'm even at this Mondo geek-a-thon.

141
00:11:55,330 --> 00:11:56,790
That's right, folks.

142
00:11:58,170 --> 00:12:03,260
This is the new and improved Blue Falcon,
starring Brad Adams.

143
00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:09,680
And a very new
and very dangerous Dynomutt.

144
00:12:19,610 --> 00:12:22,530
Like, Scooby, old buddy,
these guys are good.

145
00:12:22,690 --> 00:12:25,660
This costume competition
is gonna be kind of stiff.

146
00:12:27,030 --> 00:12:28,070
I know.

147
00:12:28,830 --> 00:12:30,990
Like, you listen to me, Scooby-Don.

148
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:34,120
You may not have
the best Dynomutt costume...

149
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:35,620
No?

150
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:38,710
...It may look and smell a little cheesy...

151
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,050
It does?

152
00:12:40,210 --> 00:12:42,590
...but you have the heart
of a Dog Wonder...

153
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:46,380
...and it's what's on the inside
that's most important.

154
00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:51,220
Yeah, the heart of a Dog Wonder.

155
00:12:52,890 --> 00:12:56,060
We'd like to enter the costume contest,
please.

156
00:12:56,230 --> 00:13:01,360
Yeah, he's the Blue Falcon
and I'm Dynomutt the Dog Wonder.

157
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:12,330
Like, zoinks.

158
00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:17,000
Hey, Shaggy. Hey, Scooby.

159
00:13:17,170 --> 00:13:19,290
See you liked my Zorak mask.

160
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:22,750
Special collectible,
complete with automated voice box.

161
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:25,420
I didn't. I hate bugs.

162
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:29,680
They go...and...and--

163
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:32,850
We got it, Scooby-Don.
You don't like bugs.

164
00:13:33,010 --> 00:13:36,940
Gang, this is Hank Prince.
He owns my favorite comic-book store.

165
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:39,190
I hang out there all the time.

166
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:42,110
Even if Hank is a little creepy.

167
00:13:42,270 --> 00:13:44,440
Shaggy. Hey, Shaggy.

168
00:13:44,610 --> 00:13:46,280
Isn't this, like, the coolest?

169
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:50,030
Yeah, Austin.
This place is, like, blowing my mind.

170
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,870
What little there is of it.

171
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:54,200
Shaggy, do me a favor.

172
00:13:54,370 --> 00:13:57,960
Can you and your groovy dog
watch my nephew here for a bit?

173
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:01,290
I can't leave my booth
and he wants to walk the convention.

174
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:03,630
Nada problemo, Hank.

175
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:07,130
- Hey, what should we do first?
- I wanna see the Blue Falcon.

176
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:10,470
The big, mega-spectacular,
dark-and-brooding movie one?

177
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:11,680
Yeah, me too.

178
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:14,970
I'm heading over there right now.
Come on, gang.

179
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:16,600
Not that one.

180
00:14:16,890 --> 00:14:20,190
The original Blue Falcon.
Owen Garrison has a booth.

181
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:23,320
Owen Garrison? Here? Where?

182
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:25,980
Right over there.

183
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:29,950
Owen Garrison, the original Blue Falcon.

184
00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:32,240
And Dynomutt.

185
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:35,990
Like, it's a dreamy dream come true.

186
00:14:36,330 --> 00:14:40,170
If you guys don't mind, I think I'll go look
for clues to this mystery about the--

187
00:14:40,330 --> 00:14:45,300
Uh-uh, shh. Like, what did I say about
ruining my fun? What did I say? What?

188
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:47,920
That's a good Velma. Good Velma.

189
00:14:48,090 --> 00:14:49,340
Shh.

190
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:52,010
I'll come with you, Vel.

191
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:56,140
As long as you promise we can stop at the
Littlest Fuzzies booth I saw on the way in.

192
00:14:56,310 --> 00:14:58,100
Autograph.

193
00:14:58,270 --> 00:14:59,850
Autograph.

194
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,770
Autograph.

195
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:06,190
Hey, I'll take one.

196
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:08,940
- Me too.
- Yeah, me too. Like, me too.

197
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:11,700
We are your biggest fans.

198
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:14,950
My biggest fans?

199
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:18,330
Fans? I have no more fans.

200
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:19,790
Uh-uh.

201
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,500
We are your fans.

202
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:23,380
Too late. Too late.

203
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:25,590
It's over. Over, I say.

204
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:29,550
Ever since they announced
that Blue Falcon movie's coming out...

205
00:15:29,710 --> 00:15:34,890
...the studio's done everything in its power
to downplay the old TV show.

206
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:37,970
They even removed the reruns
from the air...

207
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:42,350
...and they won't release my episodes
on DVD or Green-ray.

208
00:15:42,690 --> 00:15:46,900
Don't you see? No reruns, no residuals.

209
00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:51,950
Soon, no one will even remember
there was an original Blue Falcon.

210
00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:54,070
But I'll make them remember.

211
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:57,120
I'll make them all remember.

212
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:05,250
Hi there, kids. Want an autograph?

213
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:08,380
- Uh, no thanks.
- What?

214
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:11,510
Don't mind him, Mr. Garrison.
We still want your autograph.

215
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:15,760
But, like, we'll come back later
when you're feeling better.

216
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:21,310
Just walk away from the crazy man,
and smile.

217
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:31,940
I didn't know collecting toys
was such hard work.

218
00:16:32,110 --> 00:16:34,400
They're not toys, Velma Dinkley.

219
00:16:34,570 --> 00:16:36,320
They're Littlest Fuzzies.

220
00:16:36,490 --> 00:16:38,120
This is very serious business.

221
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:40,370
If you say so, Daphne Blake.

222
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:44,120
But, you know, this whole
Mega Mondo Pop! Comic ConApalooza...

223
00:16:44,290 --> 00:16:45,750
...confuses the heck out of me.

224
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:48,420
In fact, comic books
and superheroes baffle me.

225
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:51,460
They don't make logical sense.

226
00:16:52,170 --> 00:16:54,800
You wouldn't get powers
from a radioactive spider bite...

227
00:16:54,970 --> 00:16:58,430
...and wearing glasses wouldn't trick
anyone into not recognizing you.

228
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:02,970
See? You'd have to be a complete idiot
not to know it was me.

229
00:17:03,310 --> 00:17:06,600
Daphne, quick, there's something going on
at the Blue Falcon booth.

230
00:17:06,850 --> 00:17:09,150
And bring your new friend.

231
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:12,320
Really? Oy.

232
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:18,070
Fans of Mega Mondo Pop!
Comic ConApalooza, welcome.

233
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:21,160
My name is Jennifer Severin.

234
00:17:21,330 --> 00:17:23,830
You may know me as the writer,
producer and director...

235
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,460
...of the Transmollyfier movies
1 through 5:

236
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:30,000
Revenge First Strike,
Revenge Second Strike...

237
00:17:30,170 --> 00:17:32,340
...Revenge of the Revenge Seekers...

238
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:35,670
...Seekers of Revenge
Against the Revenge Seekers...

239
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:40,550
...and Big Robots Blow Things Up
to Get the Ultimate Revenge.

240
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,350
Hello.

241
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:48,270
When the studio asked me
to put the Blue Falcon on the big screen...

242
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:50,940
...I only had one question.

243
00:17:51,110 --> 00:17:54,650
Instead of a story,
can I just blow things up?

244
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:56,860
And they said yes.

245
00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:04,410
So I give you, without further ado...

246
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:09,670
The Star of The Blue Falcon Reborn Dynomutt's Revenge...

247
00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:11,630
...Brad Adams.

248
00:18:16,050 --> 00:18:18,050
Greetings, everyone.

249
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:20,470
As I've said in the press many times...

250
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,760
...Blue Falcon has been very important
to me...

251
00:18:22,890 --> 00:18:26,140
...and it was an honor
to bring him to life on the screen.

252
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,980
And I want to announce
that we will be screening...

253
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:34,230
...the entire Blue Falcon movie
on the last day of the convention.

254
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:35,440
Don't miss it.

255
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:46,540
He's not so great.

256
00:18:48,910 --> 00:18:50,420
Over here.

257
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:53,040
That guy up there is a fraud.

258
00:18:53,210 --> 00:18:54,880
A fraud, I tell you.

259
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:58,590
I, and I alone, am the Blue Falcon.

260
00:18:58,760 --> 00:18:59,930
-Autograph?
-Aah!

261
00:19:00,090 --> 00:19:02,260
- Autograph? Anyone?
- Whatever.

262
00:19:02,430 --> 00:19:05,850
Take it. Take my autograph. Take it.

263
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:09,890
Who's that guy?

264
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:12,650
Poor Mr. Garrison.

265
00:19:13,190 --> 00:19:15,650
People, who wants to see the trailer...

266
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:18,530
The Blue Falcon Reborn Dynomutt's Revenge?

267
00:19:20,110 --> 00:19:21,820
Yeah.

268
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:27,450
Get that old fossil out of here, now.

269
00:19:28,450 --> 00:19:30,370
- Come on, Owen. You're making a scene.
- Aah!

270
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:32,250
Okay, hold it right there.

271
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:33,960
James Becker, head of security.

272
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:36,040
I just wanna make sure
there's no trouble.

273
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:37,960
- I won't--
- No trouble, Mr. Becker.

274
00:19:38,130 --> 00:19:40,470
I'm Jack Rabble.
I share the booth with Owen here.

275
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:42,340
I'll just take him back. No trouble.

276
00:19:56,820 --> 00:20:00,150
Looks like those criminals
finally got the message.

277
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:01,780
That's right, BF.

278
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:05,280
Crime always pays the ultimate price.

279
00:20:08,370 --> 00:20:09,580
Who's that?

280
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:12,620
That's supposed to be
the Blue Falcon and Dynomutt.

281
00:20:12,790 --> 00:20:15,170
Like, that BF isn't even wearing a cape.

282
00:20:22,050 --> 00:20:24,300
Greetings, humans.

283
00:20:24,470 --> 00:20:27,350
lam Mr. Hyde.

284
00:20:27,510 --> 00:20:32,600
I was once like you,
but now I am so much more

285
00:20:32,730 --> 00:20:34,690
Let me show you.

286
00:20:39,110 --> 00:20:43,360
Like, that looks like Mr. Hyde,
Blue Falcon's worst enemy.

287
00:20:43,650 --> 00:20:45,200
That shot's not in the trailer.

288
00:20:52,290 --> 00:20:54,960
It is I, Mr. Hyde.

289
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:57,790
And I am here in the flesh.

290
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:00,380
It's me, Severin.

291
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:02,920
Something weird is happening.

292
00:21:03,090 --> 00:21:04,800
No, good weird.

293
00:21:05,510 --> 00:21:06,970
This doesn't look right to me.

294
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:10,470
Right. What are the chances
of this being part of the show?

295
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:14,560
Like, somewhere between slim, none,
and let's get the heck out of here.

296
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:18,810
Please pay attention
and watch very closely...

297
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:21,480
...because I am here to teach you...

298
00:21:21,650 --> 00:21:24,570
...the meaning of fear.

299
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:41,750
Fly, my children.

300
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:44,760
Destroy everything you see.

301
00:21:48,550 --> 00:21:50,220
Look out!

302
00:21:54,770 --> 00:21:56,890
Look out, Scoob.

303
00:21:59,270 --> 00:22:01,230
In here.

304
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:08,070
Like, good thinking, Scoob.

305
00:22:09,530 --> 00:22:12,200
-Aah!
- Aah! Run...

306
00:22:28,130 --> 00:22:29,470
That was close.

307
00:22:29,630 --> 00:22:32,300
Too close for the Blue Falcon booth.
Look.

308
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:44,690
Those poor people will be crushed.

309
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:46,280
Over there, the towers.

310
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:49,610
Quick, you two take the one on the right.

311
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:56,490
Nice save.

312
00:22:56,660 --> 00:22:59,500
But it won't spare you next time.

313
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:01,830
Return, my lovelies.

314
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,840
Return to your master.

315
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:13,800
Everybody, stay calm.

316
00:23:13,970 --> 00:23:18,520
I have my security guards in there right now
searching for that freaky perp.

317
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:21,270
Like, ow!

318
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:24,860
You two, over here, now.

319
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:27,360
I'm not gonna stand by
while you wreck the place...

320
00:23:27,530 --> 00:23:30,530
...in the name of some crazy PR stunt
for your movie.

321
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:33,700
Mr. Becker,
how dare you accuse us of this?

322
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:36,540
Our fans are our most treasured asset.

323
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:39,080
We would never do anything
to endanger them.

324
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:42,000
No publicity is worth that.

325
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:43,710
Excuse me, Mr. Becker...

326
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:47,710
...but we're the Mystery Incorporated gang
and we'd love to look into this for you.

327
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:49,050
It's what we do.

328
00:23:49,210 --> 00:23:50,670
We solve mysteries.

329
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:53,550
- And run away a lot.
- And eat.

330
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:56,050
So, what do you say, Mr. Becker?
Can we help?

331
00:23:56,220 --> 00:24:01,180
You kids were pretty impressive in there
with how you reacted to that emergency.

332
00:24:01,350 --> 00:24:04,900
Lives were saved.
But I can't let you get involved.

333
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:07,570
Besides, I'm shutting
the whole convention down.

334
00:24:07,730 --> 00:24:10,070
I can't be responsible
for anyone getting hurt.

335
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,700
It's just too dangerous.

336
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:14,990
Don't you worry, folks.
As mayor of San De Pedro...

337
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:20,660
...I would never let anything shutdown
the Mega Mondo Pop! Comic ConApalooza.

338
00:24:20,830 --> 00:24:24,460
You listen to me, Becker. This convention
is the biggest money maker we have.

339
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:29,340
But I can't ensure the safety of the people
with a maniac on the loose.

340
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:33,260
If you need the help, why not take
these nice youngsters up on their offer?

341
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:35,930
They've behaved so admirably already.

342
00:24:36,090 --> 00:24:37,180
And they're free.

343
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:40,270
Because I believe in young heroes.
Ha, ha.

344
00:24:42,890 --> 00:24:45,900
All right, you can help.

345
00:24:48,730 --> 00:24:50,150
Fantastic.

346
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:54,820
Gang, looks like we have another mystery
on our hands.

347
00:24:57,490 --> 00:25:00,290
All right, V.
What do we know about the monster?

348
00:25:00,450 --> 00:25:02,790
Don't look at me, Freddy.
Comics aren't my thing.

349
00:25:02,950 --> 00:25:04,870
Out of my area of expertise.

350
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:07,790
Ask Geek-o-man
and his faithful sidekick, Hungry-mutt.

351
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:10,210
She talking to us?

352
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:11,630
I think so.

353
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:15,430
- Do you two know anything about this?
- Uh-huh. A lot.

354
00:25:15,590 --> 00:25:18,140
That's right, Scooby-Don.
This Mr. Hyde character...

355
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:22,430
...he's Blue Falcon and Dynomutt's
archnemesis in the old TV show.

356
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:25,770
Willie the Weasel
was a small-time crook and inventor.

357
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:31,270
He, like, created an experimental gas
that transformed him into a nightmare.

358
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:34,990
Bringing out his terrible evil self.

359
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:42,290
As Mr. Hyde,
he's a creature of pure chaos...

360
00:25:42,450 --> 00:25:46,160
...trying to turn the world
into a dark twisted place.

361
00:25:46,330 --> 00:25:50,630
If you two know so much about Mr. Hyde,
you should take the lead on this mystery.

362
00:25:50,790 --> 00:25:54,420
- Uh-uh.
- Yeah. Like, are you kidding? No way.

363
00:25:54,590 --> 00:25:58,510
Mr. Hyde is the monster that taught us
how to be scared of monsters.

364
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:03,180
Regardless, I say our first lead would be
the movie producer, Jennifer Severin.

365
00:26:03,350 --> 00:26:06,480
She was acting a little too innocent,
if you ask me.

366
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,140
Good call, Velma.

367
00:26:08,310 --> 00:26:12,400
She's having a party tonight.
Let's check it out.

368
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:16,900
Hands off, you venal villains.

369
00:26:17,070 --> 00:26:21,700
I tell you, I don't need an invitation
to a Blue Falcon party.

370
00:26:21,870 --> 00:26:25,540
I am the Blue Falcon! Ugh.

371
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:28,120
- Come on, old-timer.
- No. Let me go.

372
00:26:28,290 --> 00:26:29,670
That's twice now.

373
00:26:29,830 --> 00:26:33,040
I think that Garrison guy
is acting pretty darn suspicious.

374
00:26:33,210 --> 00:26:35,420
Ha! Like, no way, Fred.

375
00:26:35,590 --> 00:26:37,510
He can't be the bad guy.

376
00:26:37,670 --> 00:26:39,300
He's the Blue Falcon.

377
00:26:39,470 --> 00:26:41,090
Was the Blue Falcon.

378
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:42,720
Motive enough right there.

379
00:26:47,930 --> 00:26:50,940
We're working for the mayor
and Mr. Becker.

380
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:53,320
Split up and see what we can find out.

381
00:27:01,450 --> 00:27:04,410
- Anything you can tell us about Mr. Hyde?
- Who's that?

382
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:06,830
The freaky freak
that attacked the convention?

383
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,080
The Blue Falcon's archnemesis?

384
00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:13,840
Oh, I never studied the older Blue Falcon.
In fact, I've never even watched the show.

385
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,460
Instead, I bring to the Blue Falcon
a clean slate...

386
00:27:16,630 --> 00:27:19,170
...seeing him as a divided soul
in an endless debate...

387
00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:23,430
...over the choices he's had to make
in a very real and dangerous world.

388
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:25,060
What does that even mean?

389
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:27,520
That the Blue Falcon is an enigma...

390
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:32,480
...living a life trapped within
the impossibility of certainty.

391
00:27:32,650 --> 00:27:34,900
- Makes you think.
- You take that back.

392
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:37,480
I don't have the slightest idea
what you just said...

393
00:27:37,650 --> 00:27:40,280
...but you'd better take it back, like, now.

394
00:27:40,450 --> 00:27:42,910
Come on, Shaggy.
Let's go see how the girls are doing.

395
00:27:43,410 --> 00:27:46,280
I don't have any idea
who this Mr. Hyde person might be...

396
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:49,960
...but I think you should be questioning
Owen Garrison.

397
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:53,290
It's no secret that he's threatened me
and the studio.

398
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:54,880
He's quite insane, you know.

399
00:27:55,630 --> 00:27:58,590
Yeah, yo, the projects in turnaround
and Steven's interested.

400
00:27:58,760 --> 00:27:59,920
He loves the script, man.

401
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:03,130
- Good.
- Oh, it's better than good.

402
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:07,430
It's got cyborgs, dinosaurs and penguins.
Come on, everybody loves penguins.

403
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:11,480
A $90-million opening weekend.
Yeah, a monster.

404
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:14,310
Monster? Where?

405
00:28:15,150 --> 00:28:18,480
Oh, good grief. They're not showing
that awful trailer again?

406
00:28:18,650 --> 00:28:19,990
Hey.

407
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,500
Like, where did that horrible actor guy go?
Brad Adams.

408
00:28:35,670 --> 00:28:37,250
And where's Jennifer Severin?

409
00:28:37,420 --> 00:28:38,920
Maybe security got them out.

410
00:28:39,090 --> 00:28:41,420
No time to worry about that. Look.

411
00:28:44,510 --> 00:28:48,600
Since my brutal bats were such a hit
at the convention...

412
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:53,350
...I thought you pathetic people might enjoy
my Hideous Hyde Hound.

413
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:04,530
Attack, my beauty.

414
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:08,530
Teach them the true meaning of fear.

415
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:20,880
Scooby-Don, run!

416
00:29:21,050 --> 00:29:23,720
Hey. He-he-he.

417
00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:43,900
Jeepers.

418
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,990
Wait, where's Scooby-Don?

419
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:52,580
He was right behind us.

420
00:29:54,580 --> 00:29:56,920
Scooby-Don, get out of there!

421
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:12,220
Uh-oh.

422
00:30:21,690 --> 00:30:23,400
Hey. Hey.

423
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:31,580
Okay. That was a little strange.

424
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:40,710
Did you see all those extra security guards
on the way in?

425
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:44,380
Mr. Becker is clearly expecting
another Mr. Hyde attack.

426
00:30:44,550 --> 00:30:46,090
And why are we here?

427
00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:48,720
Because we're expecting it too, Shaggy.

428
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:52,100
The best way to solve any mystery
is to be right in the middle of it.

429
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:54,970
So, what's on the mystery-solving agenda
for today, Freddy?

430
00:30:55,140 --> 00:30:57,810
There's something I'd like to check out.
Come on, gang.

431
00:31:01,650 --> 00:31:04,400
Like, hold on a second, Frederick Jones.

432
00:31:04,570 --> 00:31:07,070
You're not thinking
what I think you're thinking.

433
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:10,320
You think Owen Garrison
might be the bad guy.

434
00:31:10,490 --> 00:31:12,320
Like, you think he's Mr. Hyde.

435
00:31:12,490 --> 00:31:15,370
Shame on you, Frederick Jones.

436
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:18,410
You have to admit,
he is acting very suspicious.

437
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:21,170
I don't have to admit anything, ever.

438
00:31:21,330 --> 00:31:22,830
Oh, brother, here we go.

439
00:31:23,790 --> 00:31:25,840
Mr. Rabble, like, help me out here.

440
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,970
They think Mr. Garrison is behind
this whole Mr. Hyde craziness.

441
00:31:30,130 --> 00:31:33,680
Owen? Not in a million years.
Please, don't think badly of Owen.

442
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:36,520
He gets excitable sometimes,
but he would never hurt a fly.

443
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:39,270
- There's no way he could be--
- Hold the phone.

444
00:31:39,430 --> 00:31:43,610
Jack Rabble? You're Jack Rabble?
I knew your name sounded familiar.

445
00:31:43,770 --> 00:31:46,820
You were the guy who used to build
those wicked amazing robots...

446
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:49,360
...to compete on that game show,
Combat Bots.

447
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:37,740
Thanks. It's nice to be recognized.

448
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:40,580
These days,
I make my money signing autographs.

449
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:44,000
The same with Garrison. In fact,
we've been sharing a booth for years.

450
00:32:44,170 --> 00:32:47,460
Not exactly glamorous,
but someday we'll be back in the limelight.

451
00:32:47,630 --> 00:32:49,800
Say, would you two like to buy...

452
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:52,920
...a limited-edition
Jack Rabble Flame-o-Bot figure?

453
00:32:53,090 --> 00:32:56,260
It has custom robo-damage action.

454
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:01,180
Um, nope.

455
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:05,060
But does that remote-controlled
flying spy bot work?

456
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:06,940
You bet it does.

457
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:08,190
I'll take it.

458
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:11,610
Come on, gang. I think it's time
we checked in with Mr. Becker.

459
00:33:11,780 --> 00:33:15,200
Go on ahead.
Like, Scooby and I have a little work to do.

460
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:16,780
We do?

461
00:33:16,950 --> 00:33:20,120
I mean, we do.

462
00:33:33,970 --> 00:33:35,880
Wanna share a doughnut?

463
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:38,930
Like, this is serious, Scooby-Don.

464
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:42,680
You know how important it is to you
to represent Dynomutt properly?

465
00:33:42,850 --> 00:33:43,890
Uh-huh.

466
00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:47,020
Well, it's the same with me
and Owen Garrison.

467
00:33:47,190 --> 00:33:49,810
He's the original Blue Falcon.

468
00:33:49,980 --> 00:33:54,320
When I think of watching those shows
as a kid and what they meant to me...

469
00:33:54,490 --> 00:34:00,080
...I can't imagine a world without Owen's
brave, heroic, honest Blue Falcon.

470
00:34:00,370 --> 00:34:03,660
And to think the others wanna
investigate him in all this...

471
00:34:03,830 --> 00:34:06,500
...oh, man, it's just, like, too much.

472
00:34:07,370 --> 00:34:09,330
That's a good Shaggy.

473
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:11,340
Come on, let's get to work.

474
00:34:16,170 --> 00:34:18,430
We've been over and over these.

475
00:34:18,590 --> 00:34:19,850
There's nothing.

476
00:34:20,010 --> 00:34:22,890
Sometimes there are clues
where you least expect them.

477
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:24,770
Like right in front of you.

478
00:34:25,020 --> 00:34:26,560
We found clues.

479
00:34:26,730 --> 00:34:30,190
Namely, like, in the form
of some pretty obvious suspects.

480
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:32,690
Your friends here were saying
that Owen Garrison...

481
00:34:32,860 --> 00:34:34,650
...was the most obvious suspect.

482
00:34:34,820 --> 00:34:36,990
Au contraire, mon frére...

483
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:40,490
...which is, like, Italian for,
"Let me lay it on you."

484
00:34:41,070 --> 00:34:44,040
Observe what we observed
with our little friend here.

485
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:46,160
Firstly, Jennifer Severin...

486
00:34:46,330 --> 00:34:49,710
...writer, producer and director
of the new Blue Falcon movie...

487
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,670
...she has everything to gain by this.

488
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:54,710
I know. I know, right?

489
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:58,130
This whole Mr. Hyde thing
is working like gangbusters for us.

490
00:34:58,300 --> 00:35:01,510
Every media outlet is talking
about the movie now.

491
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:03,640
We might have a strong opening after all.

492
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:07,310
And if we do,
the studio will have me to thank.

493
00:35:07,850 --> 00:35:09,940
And then there's Brad Adams...

494
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:13,520
...an actor stifled by a role
he doesn't want.

495
00:35:13,690 --> 00:35:15,570
This whole Mr. Hyde thing is a blessing.

496
00:35:15,730 --> 00:35:19,740
If it continues to draw attention away from
me, I can bow out of this stupid franchise.

497
00:35:19,910 --> 00:35:22,070
I'm an actor. An actor.

498
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:25,740
I should be doing serious cinema,
not this lowbrow crud.

499
00:35:25,910 --> 00:35:27,370
I don't even cry once.

500
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:29,790
Last but not least, Hank Prince.

501
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:32,380
His nephew mentioned
that Hank keeps sneaking off...

502
00:35:32,540 --> 00:35:34,920
...and acting very secretive
and suspicious.

503
00:35:40,510 --> 00:35:44,930
Like, he made three suspicious phone calls
in just the short time we spied on him.

504
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:47,930
One right before the first attack.

505
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:49,890
We checked the phone records.

506
00:35:50,060 --> 00:35:52,440
Wow, you guys, that's kind of disturbing.

507
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:55,110
Impressive, but disturbing.

508
00:35:55,270 --> 00:35:58,900
Why don't you all wait outside?
There's something I wanna ask Mr. Becker.

509
00:36:02,110 --> 00:36:03,870
Really nice work there, you two.

510
00:36:04,030 --> 00:36:06,950
You opened up this mystery
to all sorts of suspects.

511
00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:09,580
High four.

512
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:13,380
I have to say, I kind of like it when
there's only one real suspect like Owen.

513
00:36:13,540 --> 00:36:15,290
Ixnay, Daph. Ahem.

514
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:20,550
I asked Mr. Becker to give us
special all-access badges.

515
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:25,100
Badges that'll let us into the green room,
for all the important guests.

516
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:27,720
- Where they have...
- Catering?

517
00:36:28,010 --> 00:36:30,980
Well, yeah. I guess they do have catering.

518
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:33,400
Big tables full of food.

519
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:37,070
Food of all kinds.

520
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:42,490
Velma, did you just intentionally get rid
of Shaggy and Scooby?

521
00:36:42,650 --> 00:36:44,110
In a word, yes.

522
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:47,030
The prime suspect in all this
is still Owen Garrison.

523
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:48,830
We really need to question him.

524
00:36:48,990 --> 00:36:53,250
I get it. Kind of hard to grill their hero
and accuse him of being Mr. Hyde...

525
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:54,830
...with those two around.

526
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,170
Uh-huh.

527
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:58,170
Well, terrific.

528
00:36:58,340 --> 00:37:01,010
I mean, while you two do that,
I'll go look for clues...

529
00:37:01,170 --> 00:37:03,130
...over by the Littlest Fuzzies booth.

530
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:06,300
See if this special badge
will get me a professional discount.

531
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:09,180
Hey, get away from that table.

532
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:11,850
- Those are mine. Mine. Mine.
- Hey.

533
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:16,690
- Don't make me hurt you. I mean it. Let go!
- Aah!

534
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:22,030
Take my identity, will you?

535
00:37:22,190 --> 00:37:24,450
I'll make you all pay, yes.

536
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:28,120
Excuse us, Mr. Garrison.
- We were wondering if we could ask...

537
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:32,120
...a few questions about Mr. Hyde, Severin,
and the new Blue Falcon movie.

538
00:37:32,790 --> 00:37:36,460
That Hollywood huckster, Severin,
and her boy toy Adams?

539
00:37:36,630 --> 00:37:39,340
Don't mention their names to me.

540
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:42,670
I spent years trying to get
one of the movie studios interested...

541
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:47,340
...in a Blue Falcon feature film,
but no one would even give me a meeting.

542
00:37:47,470 --> 00:37:49,930
Then Severin buys the rights
to the character...

543
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:51,970
...and slaps me with an injunction...

544
00:37:52,140 --> 00:37:55,140
...forbidding me from ever wearing
the costume in public.

545
00:37:55,270 --> 00:38:00,320
And they're trying to make everyone forget
that my show even existed.

546
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:03,240
Doing these lousy trade shows
in the Blue Falcon costume...

547
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:05,780
...is the only income I have.

548
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:08,160
Oh, but don't you worry.

549
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:10,990
They'll get what's coming to them.

550
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:13,250
Mark my words.

551
00:38:13,410 --> 00:38:17,500
Mark my words, they will pay!

552
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:19,920
Well, that sure was borderline
incriminating.

553
00:38:20,210 --> 00:38:24,300
I'd say it was way south of the border
and deep in the heart of Guiltytown.

554
00:38:24,460 --> 00:38:26,760
Scoob, old buddy, old pal...

555
00:38:26,930 --> 00:38:30,600
...some people want super-strength
or super-speed...

556
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:32,470
...but not me, no, sir.

557
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:36,180
Me? I just want a super-appetite.

558
00:38:36,350 --> 00:38:40,400
And you know what that means,
super starving sidekick?

559
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:42,110
Mm-hm.

560
00:38:43,230 --> 00:38:47,280
Super-powered tag-team eating attack.

561
00:39:05,630 --> 00:39:07,760
All I'm saying is be ready.

562
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:10,340
I want cameras rolling
for the next Mr. Hyde attack.

563
00:39:10,510 --> 00:39:12,050
And I want it all on film.

564
00:39:12,220 --> 00:39:16,220
It's perfect. Absolutely perfect.

565
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:19,600
Hmm.

566
00:39:20,980 --> 00:39:22,110
The food's gone!

567
00:39:22,270 --> 00:39:24,110
All of it.

568
00:39:24,270 --> 00:39:25,320
You.

569
00:39:25,690 --> 00:39:26,820
You did this.

570
00:39:27,650 --> 00:39:29,450
Like, run, Scooby-Don.

571
00:39:29,610 --> 00:39:30,820
Get back here.

572
00:39:39,250 --> 00:39:40,290
Yikes!

573
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,960
- Come on, Scoob.
- Shaggy.

574
00:39:57,770 --> 00:40:00,310
Like, it's locked.

575
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:03,020
I'm scared, Shaggy-

576
00:40:03,190 --> 00:40:04,770
Like, me too, pal.

577
00:40:04,940 --> 00:40:07,690
Come on, let's find another way out.

578
00:40:10,650 --> 00:40:11,700
You won't believe it.

579
00:40:11,860 --> 00:40:15,410
I found a Sparklelight Bear
and a Bubblefun Hippo.

580
00:40:15,530 --> 00:40:19,660
I am on a Littlest Fuzzie roll. Aah!

581
00:40:22,210 --> 00:40:26,840
Aah!
Is that a Blue Falcon Littlest Fuzzie? It is.

582
00:40:27,710 --> 00:40:30,380
I've never seen one in person.
They're so incredibly rare.

583
00:40:30,550 --> 00:40:33,680
All this Mr. Hyde mayhem
may have everyone on edge...

584
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:35,930
...but it's sure been good for business.

585
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:39,470
Old Blue Falcon stuff
is selling like hotcakes.

586
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:44,810
I've been able to raise
my already-raised prices even higher.

587
00:40:45,110 --> 00:40:49,480
You'd think since my uncle's doing so well
he'd give me a raise, but nothing.

588
00:40:49,650 --> 00:40:51,650
I'm working this booth harder than ever...

589
00:40:51,820 --> 00:40:55,410
...especially with Uncle Hank disappearing
to run errands all the time.

590
00:40:55,570 --> 00:40:56,990
Hmm.

591
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:12,510
Daphne, put the credit card down
and walk away from the Littlest Fuzzie.

592
00:41:12,670 --> 00:41:14,510
There's something you need to see.

593
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:17,100
This is episode one
of the old Blue Falcon show.

594
00:41:17,390 --> 00:41:19,220
Look familiar?

595
00:41:19,390 --> 00:41:22,230
That's exactly what happened
the night before the convention.

596
00:41:22,390 --> 00:41:23,890
And look at episode two.

597
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:28,480
Austin, what happens in episode three?

598
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:31,780
- What does Mr. Hyde do?
- That's the one where he unleashes...

599
00:41:31,940 --> 00:41:35,030
...his Hideous Hyde Hound of Basket Town
on Big City.

600
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:38,530
Hideous Hyde Hound. You don't say.

601
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:44,250
Yup. And then I think Mr. Hyde's
next appearance is in episode 22.

602
00:41:44,410 --> 00:41:47,250
In it, Mr. Hyde floods Big City
with green ooze...

603
00:41:47,420 --> 00:41:50,460
...and it transforms the townspeople
into monsters like him.

604
00:41:50,630 --> 00:41:54,550
It's titled
Blue Falcon Versus the Psycho-ooze.

605
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:57,970
I own over 17 turtlenecks
of the exact same color...

606
00:41:58,140 --> 00:42:00,560
...so I definitely know a pattern
when I see one.

607
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:02,140
We gotta tell Mr. Becker.

608
00:42:02,310 --> 00:42:04,600
Let's move out, gang.

609
00:42:28,670 --> 00:42:31,000
Like, zoinks.

610
00:43:03,370 --> 00:43:05,200
Hmm.

611
00:43:05,370 --> 00:43:06,790
Mr. Becker?
- Aah!

612
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:10,040
I already gave you kids
the all-access passes.

613
00:43:10,170 --> 00:43:12,290
Why are you back here exactly?

614
00:43:12,460 --> 00:43:15,880
Because, Mr. Becker, this is very serious.

615
00:43:18,970 --> 00:43:21,800
Quite frankly, kids,
I don't have time to worry about...

616
00:43:21,970 --> 00:43:24,510
...some stupid slime
that turns people into monsters.

617
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:27,680
I still gotta catch the clowns
who ate all the press food.

618
00:43:35,150 --> 00:43:36,400
Hmm?

619
00:43:45,740 --> 00:43:49,460
Scooby, this must be Mr. Hyde's lair.

620
00:43:49,620 --> 00:43:51,750
Uh-oh.

621
00:43:53,080 --> 00:43:57,090
He's got all kinds of floor plans
of the convention, and street maps.

622
00:43:57,260 --> 00:43:58,470
But why?

623
00:43:58,630 --> 00:44:00,680
Like, I have no idea, Scooby-Don.

624
00:44:00,840 --> 00:44:04,100
And why is this one marked
"alternate emergency route"?

625
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:06,430
Hmm?

626
00:44:28,870 --> 00:44:32,500
Zoinks.
That's the psycho-ooze, remember?

627
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:34,630
Episode 22.

628
00:44:34,790 --> 00:44:37,300
It turns people into monsters.

629
00:44:37,460 --> 00:44:39,880
What? Spies.

630
00:44:40,050 --> 00:44:41,800
Interlopers.

631
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:12,080
We're trapped.

632
00:45:16,250 --> 00:45:20,210
To those foolish enough to spy on me...

633
00:45:20,380 --> 00:45:24,680
...taste the oozing chaos of fear.

634
00:45:30,350 --> 00:45:32,020
Like, don't let it hit you, Scoob.

635
00:45:32,180 --> 00:45:35,690
Yeah.
I don't wanna be turned into a monster.

636
00:45:36,020 --> 00:45:38,400
Please, Mr. Becker,
you have to listen to us.

637
00:45:38,570 --> 00:45:40,030
The threat is real.

638
00:45:40,190 --> 00:45:43,360
Too real. Look, it's Shaggy and Scooby.

639
00:45:43,530 --> 00:45:45,240
And Mr. Hyde.

640
00:45:48,830 --> 00:45:50,330
Come on.

641
00:45:54,370 --> 00:45:57,830
Scooby, that way. The big balloon.

642
00:46:11,140 --> 00:46:14,140
Like, we gotta get to higher ground,
buddy, old pal.

643
00:46:16,310 --> 00:46:17,980
Hey, ugly.

644
00:46:19,690 --> 00:46:22,400
You leave those two alone.

645
00:46:22,570 --> 00:46:25,740
Fools. You cannot stop me.

646
00:46:38,920 --> 00:46:40,920
You cannot escape me.

647
00:46:47,590 --> 00:46:53,930
You shall watch as all of the
town is turned into hideous monsters.

648
00:47:17,290 --> 00:47:20,790
It's the end, Scoob.
They're all gonna be monsterized.

649
00:47:21,540 --> 00:47:22,710
Huh?

650
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:24,050
Over there.

651
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:27,970
City hall.

652
00:47:34,260 --> 00:47:36,680
You can hide from view...

653
00:47:36,850 --> 00:47:40,480
...but you cannot hide from Mr. Hyde.

654
00:47:40,650 --> 00:47:43,770
Go, my lovelies. Seek them out.

655
00:47:48,490 --> 00:47:50,780
Like, he's gone batty.

656
00:47:51,110 --> 00:47:54,660
And now for the finishing touch.

657
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:58,830
It's a psycho tsunami.

658
00:48:12,010 --> 00:48:13,260
Gangway.

659
00:48:15,560 --> 00:48:16,680
Open up!

660
00:48:16,850 --> 00:48:18,890
Ooze alert!

661
00:48:20,270 --> 00:48:21,440
Help!

662
00:48:29,490 --> 00:48:30,990
Hurry, Scoob!

663
00:48:31,150 --> 00:48:33,530
We're not fast enough. Quick, jump.

664
00:48:36,620 --> 00:48:40,710
Like, whatever happens,
don't let it touch you, Scooby-Don.

665
00:48:40,870 --> 00:48:44,040
Shaggy, it's rising-

666
00:48:47,630 --> 00:48:49,130
Have no doubt, my friends...

667
00:48:49,300 --> 00:48:51,880
...we will get to the bottom
of this Mr. Hyde nonsense.

668
00:48:52,050 --> 00:48:56,600
Until then, I assure you,
everything is under complete control.

669
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:01,730
Yes?

670
00:49:01,890 --> 00:49:04,060
Hey, this is Becker, Mr. Mayor.

671
00:49:04,230 --> 00:49:06,570
Hyde was just sighted
flying over city hall.

672
00:49:06,730 --> 00:49:09,230
You may be under attack.

673
00:49:09,650 --> 00:49:12,240
Well, now, I wasn't expecting that.

674
00:49:17,240 --> 00:49:19,040
Maybe we can climb our way out of this.

675
00:49:20,790 --> 00:49:22,250
And maybe not.

676
00:49:31,720 --> 00:49:35,260
- Scooby!
- Shaggy, I've been oozed.

677
00:49:35,430 --> 00:49:37,350
Me too. I swallowed some.

678
00:49:37,510 --> 00:49:39,390
It tastes like...

679
00:49:39,560 --> 00:49:41,100
Like...

680
00:49:41,270 --> 00:49:42,430
Pistachio?

681
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:44,480
Sorry to have to cut this short, folks...

682
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:47,110
...but something's come up
and I have to go to, uh...

683
00:49:47,270 --> 00:49:48,440
To the bathroom.

684
00:49:48,610 --> 00:49:50,360
City hall under attack?

685
00:49:51,190 --> 00:49:52,780
What next?

686
00:50:24,890 --> 00:50:26,940
No, Scooby. No.

687
00:50:27,100 --> 00:50:29,560
You've turned into a hideous monster.

688
00:50:29,730 --> 00:50:31,570
NU.'

689
00:50:31,730 --> 00:50:34,490
In the name of ham on rye!

690
00:50:34,650 --> 00:50:38,740
My friend, you shall be avenged!
Hoo-hon-hon.

691
00:50:38,990 --> 00:50:43,500
It's just-- It's too, too horrible.

692
00:50:43,910 --> 00:50:44,960
Shaggy?

693
00:50:45,120 --> 00:50:46,920
I'm sorry, Scooby-Don.

694
00:50:47,080 --> 00:50:50,840
I'm so sorry that you are so incredibly
hideous looking.

695
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,090
- Shaggy, I'm right behind you.
- Huh?

696
00:50:53,260 --> 00:50:54,300
Scooby-Don?

697
00:50:56,420 --> 00:50:57,680
Like, you're all right.

698
00:50:57,840 --> 00:51:00,510
- We're not monsters.
- Uh-huh.

699
00:51:00,680 --> 00:51:02,680
Of course, you're not monsters.

700
00:51:03,140 --> 00:51:04,310
You're nitwits.

701
00:51:04,470 --> 00:51:07,140
But the psycho-ooze...?

702
00:51:07,310 --> 00:51:10,810
You Mystery Incorporated nimrods
are fired.

703
00:51:17,900 --> 00:51:19,990
In a quirky Mist of the Mr. Hyde story...

704
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:22,700
...city hall was ?ooded
with a strange ooze...

705
00:51:22,870 --> 00:51:26,620
...that later turned out to be
a harmless pistachio-?avored foam

706
00:51:26,790 --> 00:51:28,370
It's just terrible what happened.

707
00:51:28,540 --> 00:51:31,880
And if this had taken place at the
Mega Mondo Pop! Comic ConApalooza...

708
00:51:32,040 --> 00:51:33,550
...it would've ruined everything.

709
00:51:33,710 --> 00:51:36,010
That's why,
due to the increased danger levels...

710
00:51:36,170 --> 00:51:38,590
...not to mention
the increased demand for tickets...

711
00:51:38,760 --> 00:51:42,510
...the Blue Falcon movie screening
will not be held at the convention center.

712
00:51:42,680 --> 00:51:47,810
It will be screened in the San De Pedro
baseball stadium across the street.

713
00:51:47,980 --> 00:51:52,310
On the lighter side of this story,
check out the two so-called investigators...

714
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:55,070
...who actually thought
they were turning into monsters.

715
00:51:55,230 --> 00:51:59,240
We found this security footage posted
on ScoopTube.com.

716
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:00,660
--monster.

717
00:52:00,820 --> 00:52:03,910
No, Scooby. No. You've turned-

718
00:52:04,410 --> 00:52:06,240
Everyone is laughing at us.

719
00:52:06,410 --> 00:52:08,040
It's only ScoopTube.

720
00:52:08,210 --> 00:52:10,330
I mean, how many people really saw it?

721
00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:12,250
Forty-two million hits so far.

722
00:52:12,420 --> 00:52:13,750
Oh.

723
00:52:14,040 --> 00:52:17,840
And it's gotten 3 million LOLs,
1.5 million ROFLs...

724
00:52:18,010 --> 00:52:21,720
...and one "BRB. Gotta clean litter box.
Mom is going crazy."

725
00:52:22,680 --> 00:52:25,930
We're the laughingstock
of the whole world.

726
00:52:27,600 --> 00:52:29,770
Hello? Mr. Rabble?

727
00:52:29,940 --> 00:52:32,980
I didn't know who else to call.
Have you kids seen Owen?

728
00:52:33,150 --> 00:52:37,280
No, Mr. Rabble. Not since before
Mr. Hyde's last attack. Why?

729
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:40,950
Oh, it's probably nothing.
Owen's probably fine. He does this.

730
00:52:41,110 --> 00:52:44,120
Goes off on his own and all.
Probably on a rant someplace.

731
00:52:44,280 --> 00:52:45,910
Don't worry.

732
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:49,450
Okay. That was weird.

733
00:52:49,960 --> 00:52:52,830
Come on, Shaggy.
We still have a mystery to solve.

734
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:54,460
You can't hide in here forever.

735
00:52:54,630 --> 00:52:56,590
You have to be seen sometime.

736
00:52:56,750 --> 00:52:59,010
Not without this paper bag on my head.

737
00:52:59,170 --> 00:53:00,800
Like, it's never coming off.

738
00:53:00,970 --> 00:53:04,090
It's kind of peaceful under here.

739
00:53:04,300 --> 00:53:05,640
Ha, ha.

740
00:53:05,800 --> 00:53:07,930
Still working out some of the kinks.

741
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:10,060
Where'd Scooby go?

742
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:15,360
Listen to me, Scooby-Doo.

743
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:19,320
You've got the heart of a Dog Wonder,
and that's what's important.

744
00:53:19,480 --> 00:53:21,070
I don't think so.

745
00:53:21,530 --> 00:53:25,030
I'm no hero. I'm a joke.

746
00:53:25,320 --> 00:53:28,490
I will be Dynomutt no more.

747
00:53:28,660 --> 00:53:29,950
Forever.

748
00:53:40,260 --> 00:53:43,720
Okay, gang, first thing we've gotta do
is find Mr. Hyde's secret room...

749
00:53:43,880 --> 00:53:46,010
...that Shaggy and Scooby
were talking about.

750
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:51,180
Hold it right there, you kids.
I have strict orders from the mayor...

751
00:53:51,350 --> 00:53:54,190
...not to let you into the convention
for any reason.

752
00:53:54,350 --> 00:53:56,060
- But, Mr. Becker--
- No buts.

753
00:53:56,230 --> 00:53:59,770
You made him look like a fool
and that makes me look like a fool.

754
00:53:59,940 --> 00:54:01,860
You're out. Banned.

755
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:10,990
Boy, it really stinks being shut out
of a mystery like this.

756
00:54:11,160 --> 00:54:12,700
We have to get back inside.

757
00:54:12,870 --> 00:54:16,080
I still have five Littlest Fuzzies on hold
in there.

758
00:54:16,250 --> 00:54:18,880
I mean, we need to solve this mystery.

759
00:54:19,040 --> 00:54:21,170
Hey, guys, could you do me a favor?

760
00:54:21,340 --> 00:54:25,050
I can't find my uncle. Could you tell him
I'm sneaking into the tech rehearsal...

761
00:54:25,220 --> 00:54:27,300
...for the premiere
of the Blue Falcon movie?

762
00:54:27,470 --> 00:54:30,560
Sorry, Austin,
but we've been banned from going inside.

763
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:32,680
Banned? Like, no way.

764
00:54:32,850 --> 00:54:34,480
Way.

765
00:54:34,640 --> 00:54:37,310
I bet I could fix that. Come on.

766
00:54:42,610 --> 00:54:44,610
Why do I have to be the Rock Ape?

767
00:54:44,780 --> 00:54:46,240
Just go with it, Vel.

768
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:48,370
I think we look great.

769
00:54:51,660 --> 00:54:53,790
They're with me.

770
00:55:01,380 --> 00:55:03,380
Now we need to find
Mr. Hyde's secret lair.

771
00:55:03,550 --> 00:55:05,800
We gotta figure out
what he's gonna do next.

772
00:55:05,970 --> 00:55:08,550
That's easy.
If he's going by the episodes...

773
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:12,310
...in his next appearance,
Mr. Hyde transforms into a huge monster...

774
00:55:12,470 --> 00:55:13,770
...and destroys the city.

775
00:55:14,270 --> 00:55:15,430
Oh, no.

776
00:55:15,930 --> 00:55:19,100
Okay, I'm heading to the stadium now.
Bye.

777
00:55:19,860 --> 00:55:23,280
Come on, gang.
W need to search Mr. Hyde's lair.

778
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:25,030
Thanks for helping, Mr. Rabble.

779
00:55:25,190 --> 00:55:27,860
But it looks like Becker and his men
were already here.

780
00:55:28,530 --> 00:55:30,280
I'm getting out of this costume.

781
00:55:30,450 --> 00:55:31,830
Me too.

782
00:55:31,990 --> 00:55:35,200
I'm totally burning up in this thing.

783
00:55:36,450 --> 00:55:38,040
Hold the phone.

784
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:44,250
Huh?

785
00:55:56,140 --> 00:55:59,390
Looks like Mr. Hyde hacked into
the convention center's security.

786
00:55:59,730 --> 00:56:01,810
Wow, he could see everything.

787
00:56:01,980 --> 00:56:03,230
And control the alarms.

788
00:56:08,740 --> 00:56:11,360
I'm sad and hungry.

789
00:56:11,530 --> 00:56:14,160
Really, really hungry.

790
00:56:14,330 --> 00:56:17,830
Yeah. Moping all day
sure builds up an appetite.

791
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:21,750
Maybe we should get something to eat,
but not be happy about it.

792
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:23,380
Yeah.

793
00:56:23,540 --> 00:56:25,460
Not happy-

794
00:56:26,670 --> 00:56:28,920
Look, it's the baseball stadium.

795
00:56:29,840 --> 00:56:33,090
Why would Mr. Hyde have
a camera there?

796
00:56:37,270 --> 00:56:39,850
Ladies and gentlemen, stay in line.

797
00:56:40,020 --> 00:56:41,650
The gates will be open soon.

798
00:56:53,820 --> 00:56:57,490
Testing. One, two, three. Testing. Okay.

799
00:56:57,660 --> 00:57:00,370
Can we put up the video screen?

800
00:57:00,540 --> 00:57:02,120
Great.

801
00:57:02,290 --> 00:57:06,130
I'll start by presenting our star,
Brad Adams...

802
00:57:06,290 --> 00:57:10,510
...who will then introduce
the new Blue Falcon movie.

803
00:57:10,670 --> 00:57:11,840
- Roll the film.
- Yeah.

804
00:57:16,390 --> 00:57:19,220
I think maybe Mr. Hyde
had this all planned.

805
00:57:19,390 --> 00:57:20,850
Yeah, by creating chaos...

806
00:57:21,020 --> 00:57:23,140
...he made the convention center
too dangerous.

807
00:57:23,310 --> 00:57:26,230
And got the screening moved
to the baseball stadium.

808
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:28,020
But why?

809
00:57:38,240 --> 00:57:39,790
That's right, Dog Wonder.

810
00:57:39,950 --> 00:57:43,080
I didn't even know
a body could explode like that.

811
00:57:43,250 --> 00:57:45,040
With enough dynamite, BF...

812
00:57:45,210 --> 00:57:47,340
- ...anything can explode.
- Hey, who's that?

813
00:57:47,500 --> 00:57:49,550
- Who's back there?
- Ha-ha-ha. True.

814
00:57:49,710 --> 00:57:51,760
There. Look.

815
00:58:06,270 --> 00:58:07,520
Aah.

816
00:58:07,690 --> 00:58:12,150
Come on.
All this chaos is starting to make sense.

817
00:58:13,110 --> 00:58:14,780
Awesome.

818
00:58:15,240 --> 00:58:17,450
This show is over.

819
00:58:17,620 --> 00:58:20,450
No one will see this film.

820
00:58:20,830 --> 00:58:24,920
No one. So says Mr. Hyde.

821
00:58:52,110 --> 00:58:54,440
Like, maybe while everyone's
watching the movie...

822
00:58:54,610 --> 00:58:57,660
...we can get some hot dogs
without anyone seeing us.

823
00:58:58,280 --> 00:58:59,990
Run!

824
00:59:02,330 --> 00:59:05,120
Like, the crowd's leaving
before the movie's even started.

825
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:07,670
More food for us.

826
00:59:07,830 --> 00:59:11,960
Scooby-Don, old pal,
I love the way you think.

827
00:59:16,680 --> 00:59:19,010
Uh, maybe this was a bad idea.

828
00:59:38,200 --> 00:59:40,620
Oh, no. Look, it's Austin.

829
00:59:46,410 --> 00:59:48,670
Like, where's a hero when you need him?

830
00:59:48,830 --> 00:59:49,920
Huh?

831
00:59:50,080 --> 00:59:54,880
Remember, Scooby, it's the hero
inside of you that saves the day.

832
00:59:55,510 --> 00:59:58,050
Yeah. I can do this.

833
01:00:01,890 --> 01:00:04,890
Who are you supposed to be?
Captain Necktie?

834
01:00:05,140 --> 01:00:06,890
NO.

835
01:00:07,480 --> 01:00:09,520
Dynomutt.

836
01:00:10,980 --> 01:00:13,060
Scooby!

837
01:00:17,570 --> 01:00:18,860
Mr. Hyde...

838
01:00:19,030 --> 01:00:21,070
...face me if you dare.

839
01:00:21,530 --> 01:00:24,700
This show is over.

840
01:00:24,870 --> 01:00:27,290
No one will see this film.

841
01:00:27,450 --> 01:00:32,380
No one. So says Mr. Hyde. Ha-ha-ha.

842
01:01:03,110 --> 01:01:05,120
Ha! This is going right on the Internet.

843
01:01:05,280 --> 01:01:08,410
ScoopTube fame, here I come. Ha-ha-ha.

844
01:01:09,290 --> 01:01:13,380
It's paper bags for the rest of our lives.

845
01:01:16,170 --> 01:01:18,340
Where are Shaggy and Scooby?
They saved me.

846
01:01:18,510 --> 01:01:22,130
While that crazy giant Mr. Hyde
was kicking their butts, I got away.

847
01:01:22,970 --> 01:01:24,720
They're okay, Austin. Don't worry.

848
01:01:24,890 --> 01:01:27,470
But we need to stop
that monstrosity now.

849
01:01:28,060 --> 01:01:30,270
Come on, gang. I've got an idea.

850
01:01:30,430 --> 01:01:32,980
We got a serious situation
at the baseball stadium.

851
01:01:33,140 --> 01:01:37,650
Alert the local authorities.
We need to clear the area and fast.

852
01:01:39,190 --> 01:01:41,740
This show is over.

853
01:01:41,900 --> 01:01:44,820
No one will see this film.

854
01:01:44,990 --> 01:01:50,040
No one. So says Mr. Hyde.

855
01:01:51,120 --> 01:01:52,790
Hey, you.

856
01:01:52,960 --> 01:01:56,590
Why don't you sit down and be quiet?
Some of us still wanna see the movie.

857
01:02:02,170 --> 01:02:03,880
Now.

858
01:02:50,970 --> 01:02:53,390
This show is over.

859
01:02:53,560 --> 01:02:56,690
No one will see this film.

860
01:02:56,850 --> 01:03:01,780
No one. So says Mr. Hyde.

861
01:03:06,240 --> 01:03:09,240
Now let's see who this Mr. Hyde really is.

862
01:03:18,500 --> 01:03:20,920
Owen Garrison.

863
01:03:21,090 --> 01:03:22,420
So it was him.

864
01:03:22,590 --> 01:03:27,720
Sometimes, the most obvious bad guy
is the actual bad guy.

865
01:03:28,840 --> 01:03:30,350
Arrest that man.

866
01:03:33,680 --> 01:03:35,890
What? Where am I?

867
01:03:36,730 --> 01:03:42,610
How did I get into this robot
and this Mr. Hyde costume?

868
01:03:42,940 --> 01:03:46,360
It's a mess down here.
Set up a roadblock on Stadium Street.

869
01:03:51,120 --> 01:03:55,040
Attention, Car 47,
traffic is blocked on Stadium Street.

870
01:03:55,200 --> 01:03:58,370
Use the alternative emergency route.

871
01:03:58,620 --> 01:04:01,710
I'm innocent, I tell you. I am innocent.

872
01:04:01,880 --> 01:04:03,040
Hold on now.

873
01:04:03,210 --> 01:04:06,050
Owen might be a deranged,
cranky old man...

874
01:04:06,210 --> 01:04:10,300
...out of touch with what the public wants
these days, but he's a fellow actor.

875
01:04:10,470 --> 01:04:12,640
He could never have endangered
all these people.

876
01:04:12,800 --> 01:04:16,980
That's right. You must have knocked me out
and put me in that robot.

877
01:04:17,140 --> 01:04:21,480
You and that horrible
producer-slash-director of yours.

878
01:04:21,650 --> 01:04:25,940
Like I said, he's a deranged, cranky old man
who's out of touch, and he probably did it.

879
01:04:26,110 --> 01:04:28,150
Take him away, officers.

880
01:04:29,450 --> 01:04:32,660
Something sure feels fishy about all this.

881
01:04:56,390 --> 01:04:59,350
Zoinks! Mr. Hyde's here.

882
01:05:01,270 --> 01:05:03,770
Shaggy, we have to stop him.

883
01:05:03,940 --> 01:05:06,690
Let's ride, Dog Wonder.

884
01:05:16,240 --> 01:05:17,290
Pull over.

885
01:05:19,750 --> 01:05:22,000
Yeah. Like, pull over, please.

886
01:05:22,170 --> 01:05:25,210
I don't think I can keep this up
for much longer.

887
01:05:37,850 --> 01:05:39,890
Get off, you stupid dog.

888
01:05:40,060 --> 01:05:43,020
Hideous Hyde Hound, destroy him.

889
01:05:57,780 --> 01:05:59,080
Low bridge.

890
01:06:08,750 --> 01:06:11,010
Get out of the way. I can't see.

891
01:06:11,170 --> 01:06:14,470
Move. No. No!

892
01:06:45,710 --> 01:06:48,130
You, dog.

893
01:06:48,460 --> 01:06:51,250
You are going to pay with your life.

894
01:06:51,420 --> 01:06:54,220
Hideous Hyde Hound, attack.

895
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:09,980
Climb aboard, Dog Wonder.

896
01:07:10,610 --> 01:07:13,400
Don't mind if I do, BF.

897
01:07:13,570 --> 01:07:14,820
Dog Wonder.

898
01:07:14,990 --> 01:07:17,240
And Blue Falcon.

899
01:07:19,780 --> 01:07:21,450
Away.

900
01:07:38,260 --> 01:07:40,180
This is not good.

901
01:07:40,350 --> 01:07:43,350
Not so fast, you creepy crook.

902
01:07:52,820 --> 01:07:55,440
Stick around, Mr. Hyde.

903
01:07:55,740 --> 01:07:57,530
You did it, Scooby-Doo.

904
01:07:59,200 --> 01:08:01,530
You're a hero. A real hero.

905
01:08:03,790 --> 01:08:06,960
- Good job, Dog Wonder.
- Aww.

906
01:08:10,670 --> 01:08:12,210
Austin, you're all right.

907
01:08:12,670 --> 01:08:14,670
I was incredibly worried.

908
01:08:14,840 --> 01:08:15,960
Where have you been?

909
01:08:16,130 --> 01:08:18,630
I'm sorry I've been so secretive lately.

910
01:08:18,800 --> 01:08:22,140
It's just that I was courting
this wonderful woman.

911
01:08:22,300 --> 01:08:24,720
Her name's Nora Spinkleton.

912
01:08:24,890 --> 01:08:28,350
But I know and love her
as Princess Garogflotach...

913
01:08:28,520 --> 01:08:30,400
...of the Kloxnicht Nebula.

914
01:08:33,320 --> 01:08:35,610
I love you too, sweetness.

915
01:08:35,780 --> 01:08:39,070
No, Hank, in Kloxnichtian.

916
01:08:39,240 --> 01:08:40,610
Oh, right.

917
01:08:48,750 --> 01:08:50,580
Thank you, Mystery Incorporated.

918
01:08:50,870 --> 01:08:53,540
Thank you for saving my nephew.

919
01:08:53,710 --> 01:08:55,590
How can I ever repay you?

920
01:08:55,920 --> 01:08:58,420
Well, there is a certain limited-edition...

921
01:08:58,590 --> 01:09:01,800
...Blue Falcon Littlest Fuzzie
I wouldn't mind taking off your hands.

922
01:09:01,970 --> 01:09:06,100
But first,
let's see who Mr. Hyde really, really is.

923
01:09:06,260 --> 01:09:08,810
Jack Rabble?

924
01:09:11,100 --> 01:09:13,730
- It all makes sense now.
- It does?

925
01:09:13,900 --> 01:09:15,940
Don't be so thick, you flatfoot.

926
01:09:16,190 --> 01:09:20,700
It's simple really. It all started years ago
when I was permanently disqualified...

927
01:09:20,860 --> 01:09:23,820
...from Combat Bots because my robots
were deemed too dangerous.

928
01:09:26,790 --> 01:09:29,120
One of them actually destroyed
the studio.

929
01:09:43,550 --> 01:09:45,640
So I was banned.

930
01:09:45,800 --> 01:09:48,140
Deprived of the one thing I loved...

931
01:09:48,390 --> 01:09:51,980
...making robots
who destroy other robots.

932
01:09:52,310 --> 01:09:56,610
I was forced to eke out a pathetic living
doing these conventions.

933
01:09:56,770 --> 01:10:01,150
Times got so tough, I started sharing a
booth with Owen Garrison to save money.

934
01:10:01,490 --> 01:10:05,490
After years and years and years
of hearing Garrison complain...

935
01:10:05,660 --> 01:10:08,490
...about not being able
to revive Blue Falcon...

936
01:10:08,660 --> 01:10:11,500
...and then about Severin
giving the part to Adams...

937
01:10:11,660 --> 01:10:15,040
...I finally came up with this brilliant plan.

938
01:10:15,210 --> 01:10:18,340
Using my knowledge of robots
and special effects...

939
01:10:18,500 --> 01:10:20,420
...I created Mr. Hyde.

940
01:10:20,590 --> 01:10:24,800
And a bunch of remote-control bats
and a remote-control monster dog.

941
01:10:24,970 --> 01:10:27,850
I rigged robotic legs
to give me super jumping abilities...

942
01:10:28,010 --> 01:10:31,770
...and fitted them out with smoke machines
to disguise my comings and goings.

943
01:10:31,930 --> 01:10:35,850
I used knockout gas on Owen,
and put him in the giant robot...

944
01:10:36,020 --> 01:10:38,980
...which was remote-controlled
by yours truly...

945
01:10:39,150 --> 01:10:41,320
...in a master stroke of genius.

946
01:10:41,480 --> 01:10:44,990
So Mr. Garrison really was asleep
in there.

947
01:10:45,160 --> 01:10:48,990
But all this?
All this was just for a simple robbery?

948
01:10:49,160 --> 01:10:52,450
Nothing simple about it, hair-boy.
I needed to divert traffic...

949
01:10:52,620 --> 01:10:56,960
...so that armored car would go down
an empty side street where I could attack it.

950
01:10:57,130 --> 01:11:01,250
That baby held the proceeds from all
the entrance fees for the convention.

951
01:11:01,420 --> 01:11:03,970
It was over 5 million bucks.

952
01:11:04,130 --> 01:11:05,470
Hey, you kids.

953
01:11:05,630 --> 01:11:07,640
I demand to know what's going on.

954
01:11:08,890 --> 01:11:12,060
And who to thank for stopping Mr. Hyde.

955
01:11:12,390 --> 01:11:14,890
Your heroes are right here, Mr. Mayor.

956
01:11:15,060 --> 01:11:18,360
Owen Garrison, the original Blue Falcon...

957
01:11:18,480 --> 01:11:21,860
...and his faithful canine companion.

958
01:11:22,650 --> 01:11:24,240
I always knew you had it in you.

959
01:11:24,400 --> 01:11:28,870
Glad I hired you and your friends.
See? I believe in young heroes.

960
01:11:28,990 --> 01:11:30,280
Take some pictures, boys.

961
01:11:31,790 --> 01:11:34,250
It's not fair. I was so close.

962
01:11:34,410 --> 01:11:36,540
So close to all that money.

963
01:11:36,710 --> 01:11:38,670
And I would have gotten away
with it too...

964
01:11:38,830 --> 01:11:42,210
...if it weren't for you meddling kids.

965
01:11:47,800 --> 01:11:50,600
You know how I'm always wanting
better dramatic parts?

966
01:11:50,890 --> 01:11:54,220
Well, this whole thing has taught me
a valuable lesson...

967
01:11:54,390 --> 01:11:57,270
...in what storytelling is truly all about.

968
01:11:57,810 --> 01:12:01,110
Maybe storytelling should be more
than explosions...

969
01:12:01,230 --> 01:12:03,070
...special effects and publicity.

970
01:12:03,230 --> 01:12:08,780
Maybe it should be about
how Owen looks so good in that costume.

971
01:12:08,950 --> 01:12:11,320
I think I've got an idea for the sequel.

972
01:12:16,540 --> 01:12:19,620
I'm standing in from of the premiere
of the Blue Falcon sequel...

973
01:12:19,790 --> 01:12:22,670
Blue Falcon 2, The Return Begins Again.

974
01:12:22,840 --> 01:12:25,380
It's just about finished,
and I, for one, can't wait...

975
01:12:25,550 --> 01:12:28,130
...to hear the reactions
of those lucky viewers inside.

976
01:12:44,610 --> 01:12:46,780
You may have me outnumbered...

977
01:12:46,940 --> 01:12:49,820
...but I'm taking almost all of you
with me.

978
01:12:55,740 --> 01:12:58,250
Take that, evildoers.

979
01:12:58,410 --> 01:13:02,460
Looks like we got here just in time,
eh, Dog Wonder?

980
01:13:02,630 --> 01:13:04,170
Sure did, BF.

981
01:13:07,510 --> 01:13:09,090
The original Blue Falcon.

982
01:13:09,510 --> 01:13:12,300
It can't be. Unless...

983
01:13:12,470 --> 01:13:14,350
That means you-- You're--

984
01:13:14,510 --> 01:13:15,850
That's right.

985
01:13:16,680 --> 01:13:18,680
I'm your father.

986
01:13:20,190 --> 01:13:22,480
And that means that Dynomutt
is actually...

987
01:13:23,940 --> 01:13:25,190
Scooby-Don.

988
01:13:28,820 --> 01:13:31,700
Like, old buddy, you are a real hero...

989
01:13:31,860 --> 01:13:34,490
...and a real movie star.

990
01:13:34,660 --> 01:13:36,160
Take a bow.

991
01:13:40,290 --> 01:13:43,380
- Scooby-Dooby-Doo.
- Scooby-Dooby-Doo.
