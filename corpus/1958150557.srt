00:02:24,112 --> 00:02:26,313
<i>Meanwhile,</i>
<i>in the state of Oklahoma,</i>

2
00:02:26,446 --> 00:02:28,516
<i>today is</i>
<i>the scheduled day of execution</i>

00:02:30,484 --> 00:02:32,285

5
00:02:32,419 --> 00:02:34,522

6
00:02:34,656 --> 00:02:36,189
<i>incontrovertible evidence,</i>

7
00:02:36,323 --> 00:02:37,892

9
00:02:40,595 --> 00:02:41,996

00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:43,865

11
00:02:43,998 --> 00:02:45,600
<i>I mean,</i>

12
00:02:45,733 --> 00:02:48,168
<i>why this guy</i>

13
00:02:48,301 --> 00:02:51,839
<i>How is this guy still alive?</i>

14
00:02:54,374 --> 00:02:55,308
<i>He's expected.</i>

15
00:02:55,442 --> 00:02:56,878
<i>Let him through.</i>

16
00:03:33,313 --> 00:03:34,782
Dr. James Martin here

17
00:03:34,916 --> 00:03:37,719
for the psychiatric evaluation
of Edward Wayne Brady.

18
00:03:38,251 --> 00:03:39,554
Are you currently
in possession

19
00:03:39,687 --> 00:03:42,056
of any alcohol, tobacco,
firearms or narcotics?

20
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:43,624
No.

21
00:03:43,758 --> 00:03:45,392
Just turn off your ignition,
step from your vehicle

22
00:03:45,526 --> 00:03:47,662
with your identification
in hand.

23
00:03:50,698 --> 00:03:52,265
Step over here, please.

24
00:03:58,472 --> 00:03:59,707
Turn around.

25
00:04:01,976 --> 00:04:03,443
One to come through.

26
00:04:03,911 --> 00:04:06,681
Step through, leave your keys
and phone in the pass through.

27
00:04:13,154 --> 00:04:15,556
Welcome to the least
happy place on Earth.

28
00:04:16,057 --> 00:04:17,759
-Warden Tom Moss.
-Nice to meet you.

29
00:04:17,892 --> 00:04:19,660
Thanks for filling in
on short notice.

30
00:04:19,794 --> 00:04:22,163
No offense, but I'd rather
not be here at all.

31
00:04:22,295 --> 00:04:24,065
Yeah. You and everybody else.

32
00:04:24,532 --> 00:04:26,399
Look, why don't you just
sign off, and we'll be done.

33
00:04:26,834 --> 00:04:28,836
Unfortunately,
that's not the way it works.

34
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:31,072
Everyone deserves
an impartial review.

35
00:04:31,205 --> 00:04:33,775
Not everyone. Follow me.

36
00:04:34,609 --> 00:04:35,810
Sorry to hear

37
00:04:35,943 --> 00:04:38,179
about Dr. Fischer.
Did you know him?

38
00:04:38,579 --> 00:04:39,847
I did. Yes.

39
00:04:39,981 --> 00:04:41,816
He was, uh,
something of a mentor to me.

40
00:04:41,949 --> 00:04:44,519
Yeah, well, I tell you this,
his timing sucked.

41
00:04:44,652 --> 00:04:46,854
Every time this guy Brady's
number comes up,

42
00:04:46,988 --> 00:04:48,189
something happens.

43
00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:51,626
Execution scheduled
for 11:00 p.m.

44
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:52,994
That's not
for public knowledge,

45
00:04:53,127 --> 00:04:55,229
so please don't convey that
to anyone.

46
00:04:55,362 --> 00:04:56,363
We're going
to need your decision

47
00:04:56,496 --> 00:04:58,166
by 4:00 p.m. at the latest,

48
00:04:58,298 --> 00:04:59,834
if we're gonna stay
on schedule.

49
00:04:59,967 --> 00:05:00,935
If there's any problems,

50
00:05:01,068 --> 00:05:02,770
I'd rather know sooner
than later.

51
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:04,639
If we're gonna
do my job properly,

52
00:05:04,772 --> 00:05:06,274
we're gonna need some privacy.

53
00:05:06,406 --> 00:05:09,277
No, it's not a problem.
He's been taken from his cell.

54
00:05:09,409 --> 00:05:11,411
You'll be meeting him
in a common area.

55
00:05:11,546 --> 00:05:12,847
Normally,
that's where we allow

56
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:15,616
last contact with family,
but he doesn't have any.

57
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:17,018
From there, he'll be showered,

58
00:05:17,151 --> 00:05:18,719
taken to the holding cell
in the Death House

59
00:05:18,853 --> 00:05:20,755
not far from
the execution chamber.

60
00:05:20,888 --> 00:05:23,057
That's where he'll be spending
his last couple hours.

61
00:05:23,191 --> 00:05:26,093
I'm assuming you already
reviewed the Fischer files?

62
00:05:26,227 --> 00:05:27,628
Yes.

63
00:05:27,762 --> 00:05:29,429
Then you already know
he's a master manipulator.

64
00:05:29,564 --> 00:05:31,299
Absolute genius.

65
00:05:31,431 --> 00:05:33,267
And right now,
his entire existence

66
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,702
is focused on one thing.

67
00:05:34,836 --> 00:05:37,138
Convincing you
he's totally insane.

68
00:05:37,271 --> 00:05:38,306
And therefore incapable

69
00:05:38,438 --> 00:05:39,841
of being executed
under state law.

70
00:05:39,974 --> 00:05:41,075
Yeah.

71
00:05:41,209 --> 00:05:42,342
You listen to him,

72
00:05:42,475 --> 00:05:43,845
by the time
he's done with you,

73
00:05:43,978 --> 00:05:45,445
he'll have your head
so twisted around

74
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:47,380
you'll think
you're the killer, not him.

75
00:06:06,133 --> 00:06:07,367
So you think
it's all an act?

76
00:06:07,501 --> 00:06:09,369
Of course it is. Open up.

77
00:06:10,037 --> 00:06:12,039
Well, for what it's worth,
Fischer disagreed with you.

78
00:06:12,173 --> 00:06:13,674
Just wasn't sure whether
the root of the problem

79
00:06:13,808 --> 00:06:15,243
was psychotic or psychogenic.

80
00:06:17,778 --> 00:06:19,213
Whether it stems
from his brain

81
00:06:19,347 --> 00:06:20,715
losing its grip on reality

82
00:06:20,848 --> 00:06:22,650
or some mental
or emotional stressor.

83
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:24,585
That's the problem
with you shrinks.

84
00:06:24,719 --> 00:06:26,120
Too smart
for your own damn good.

85
00:06:26,254 --> 00:06:28,388
Can I have a radio, please?

86
00:06:28,522 --> 00:06:30,524
Look,
Brady knows what's coming.

87
00:06:30,658 --> 00:06:32,026
He's playing the system,

88
00:06:32,159 --> 00:06:34,662
and if you allow him to,
he'll play you, too.

89
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:37,899
Look, I get lied to
all the time.

90
00:06:38,532 --> 00:06:40,400
Figuring out the truth
behind the lie

91
00:06:40,534 --> 00:06:42,169
is what I get paid to do.

92
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:45,172
Take this.
If you need anything,

93
00:06:45,306 --> 00:06:47,742
there's always somebody
monitoring that channel.

94
00:06:57,417 --> 00:06:58,653
Thanks.

95
00:07:13,234 --> 00:07:14,467
Morning.

96
00:07:15,736 --> 00:07:17,338
Allow me to introduce myself.
I'm, uh...

97
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:19,240
Dr. James Ansel Martin.

98
00:07:20,174 --> 00:07:22,343
Valedictorian,
University of Chicago.

99
00:07:22,475 --> 00:07:23,878
Bachelor of Science,
biochemistry.

100
00:07:24,011 --> 00:07:25,880
Salutatorian, Johns Hopkins.

101
00:07:26,013 --> 00:07:27,915
Medical School with
a residency in Psychiatry.

102
00:07:28,049 --> 00:07:30,751
Currently, the youngest
full professor on staff at OU.

103
00:07:30,885 --> 00:07:32,853
It's not exactly...

104
00:07:32,987 --> 00:07:36,857
Stanford, but then again
we are in Oklahoma, aren't we?

105
00:07:37,625 --> 00:07:39,894
Guttmacher award recipient,
author of numerous articles,

106
00:07:40,027 --> 00:07:43,030
American society
of psychiatry.

107
00:07:44,398 --> 00:07:46,801
Once engaged, never married
and father of none.

108
00:07:46,934 --> 00:07:49,570
You want to have
a seat right there,

109
00:07:49,704 --> 00:07:51,172
have a little chat with me?

110
00:08:01,615 --> 00:08:03,050
I'm gonna ask you
some questions.

111
00:08:03,517 --> 00:08:05,019
I'm hoping you'll answer them.

112
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07,221
I'd like you to be
as comfortable as you can.

113
00:08:07,355 --> 00:08:10,490
Do you know what the first
thing they will do to me is

114
00:08:10,624 --> 00:08:12,293
once I've been
pronounced dead?

115
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:13,794
I'm afraid I don't.

116
00:08:13,928 --> 00:08:15,062
Autopsy.

117
00:08:17,331 --> 00:08:19,734
It just seems odd, doesn't it?

118
00:08:19,867 --> 00:08:21,802
I mean,
all that cutting

119
00:08:22,403 --> 00:08:23,971
and weighing of organs.

120
00:08:24,105 --> 00:08:26,507
I mean, certainly they'll know
what the cause of death is.

121
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:27,842
I'm just...

122
00:08:28,609 --> 00:08:30,644
It just seems strange, right?

123
00:08:30,778 --> 00:08:32,513
And why bother?

124
00:08:33,948 --> 00:08:36,384
I suppose to make sure
the job is done.

125
00:08:36,951 --> 00:08:39,153
Well, it's just a little
barbaric, don't you think?

126
00:08:39,286 --> 00:08:41,689
I assume you know
Dr. Fischer has passed away.

127
00:08:41,822 --> 00:08:44,158
Come on now.
He committed suicide.

128
00:08:44,592 --> 00:08:46,660
I know that
because I made him do it.

129
00:08:48,929 --> 00:08:50,297
Why would you do that?

130
00:08:51,232 --> 00:08:52,700
Serving my purpose.

131
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:54,602
You're here, aren't you?

132
00:08:54,735 --> 00:08:55,936
Why would you want me here
instead of him?

133
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:58,339
-I didn't like him.
-And you like me?

134
00:08:58,973 --> 00:09:03,611
Well, no, but I chose you
because I need you

135
00:09:04,412 --> 00:09:05,746
to do something for me.

136
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:07,615
See,
you're gonna write my story.

137
00:09:08,482 --> 00:09:09,717
And why would I do that?

138
00:09:10,484 --> 00:09:11,919
Because I want you to.

139
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:13,687
I see.

140
00:09:13,821 --> 00:09:17,992
Well, not sure you do,
but you will soon.

141
00:09:18,259 --> 00:09:21,695
How can you be so sure?
Are you, um, are you God?

142
00:09:21,829 --> 00:09:23,497
Don't play with me, James.

143
00:09:24,098 --> 00:09:25,366
You continue
to ask stupid questions,

144
00:09:25,499 --> 00:09:26,767
and I'll end this session.

145
00:09:26,901 --> 00:09:28,202
Well, that would be
unfortunate for you

146
00:09:28,335 --> 00:09:29,637
because I'd have to
make my determination

147
00:09:29,770 --> 00:09:31,372
based upon
limited information.

148
00:09:32,206 --> 00:09:34,608
-And you think that scares me?
-Oh, it should.

149
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:39,213
I mean, it, it would me.
Being so near to death.

150
00:09:40,714 --> 00:09:43,317
Death doesn't scare me, James.

151
00:09:44,251 --> 00:09:45,286
And why is that?

152
00:09:46,587 --> 00:09:48,656
Because I can't die.

153
00:09:49,824 --> 00:09:51,325
See, James,

154
00:09:52,359 --> 00:09:53,761
I'm a demon.

155
00:10:03,804 --> 00:10:04,738
Do you have a name?

156
00:10:04,872 --> 00:10:06,073
Of course I have a name.

157
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:07,374
Would you like me
to call you by it?

158
00:10:07,509 --> 00:10:08,543
Depends. Do I call you James?

159
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:10,878
-I'd prefer Dr. Martin.
-Of course you would.

160
00:10:11,245 --> 00:10:14,181
It's my title. I, uh, I worked
very hard to achieve it.

161
00:10:14,315 --> 00:10:16,484
And it preserves the nature
of our relationship.

162
00:10:16,617 --> 00:10:17,785
We can do that.

163
00:10:17,918 --> 00:10:18,786
As long as you agree
to acknowledge

164
00:10:18,919 --> 00:10:20,187
my honorifics as well.

165
00:10:20,321 --> 00:10:21,255
Which is?

166
00:10:21,388 --> 00:10:23,224
Lord High Prince.

167
00:10:24,425 --> 00:10:25,459
I, um...

168
00:10:26,127 --> 00:10:28,129
-I won't be doing that.
-Okey-dokey.

169
00:10:28,262 --> 00:10:29,964
And since we're gonna be
on a first-name basis,

170
00:10:30,097 --> 00:10:31,499
I guess I'll allow you
to use mine.

171
00:10:31,632 --> 00:10:32,833
-Edward?
-No.

172
00:10:32,967 --> 00:10:34,468
That's merely the name
of the host body,

173
00:10:34,603 --> 00:10:35,803
the shell which I inhabit.

174
00:10:35,936 --> 00:10:37,539
I no longer answer to it.

175
00:10:38,105 --> 00:10:39,406
The name
my master gifted to me

176
00:10:39,541 --> 00:10:40,741
is in a Phoenician dialect

177
00:10:40,875 --> 00:10:42,309
that hasn't been spoken
for 3,500 years,

178
00:10:42,443 --> 00:10:44,613
but I'll give you the nearest
English equivalent,

179
00:10:44,745 --> 00:10:47,481
which would be Nefariamus.

180
00:10:47,616 --> 00:10:49,049
Nef... Nefarious?

181
00:10:49,183 --> 00:10:51,051
A closer translation would be
"He who is nefarious

182
00:10:51,185 --> 00:10:52,554
"suggesting possession
of trade full measure."

183
00:10:52,686 --> 00:10:54,221
And Nefarious isn't
a real name.

184
00:10:54,355 --> 00:10:55,389
Says who, James?

185
00:10:57,024 --> 00:10:59,126
<i>Cephas</i> meaning "rock,"
or in Latin <i>Petrus,</i>

186
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:00,661
wasn't a name
until the carpenter

187
00:11:00,794 --> 00:11:01,862
gave it to that
obnoxious fisherman.

188
00:11:01,996 --> 00:11:03,497
Not a good name until it is.

189
00:11:03,764 --> 00:11:05,699
Somebody uses it,
it becomes a name.

190
00:11:05,833 --> 00:11:06,867
You...
You seem a bit defensive.

191
00:11:07,001 --> 00:11:08,369
Names are important.

192
00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:10,337
They have power.

193
00:11:10,471 --> 00:11:13,007
They let everyone know
who we are.

194
00:11:15,544 --> 00:11:19,079
Ain't that right, Jimmy?

195
00:11:26,387 --> 00:11:28,289
I'm sorry if I offended you.
That wasn't my intention.

196
00:11:28,422 --> 00:11:29,524
Of course it was.

197
00:11:30,424 --> 00:11:34,061
What's a little malice
between friends?

198
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:40,434
What's so funny?

199
00:11:48,709 --> 00:11:50,044
I have a secret.

200
00:11:50,545 --> 00:11:51,946
Something you'd like to share?

201
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:54,915
I don't think
you're gonna like it.

202
00:11:55,049 --> 00:11:56,984
Well, how will I know
unless you tell me?

203
00:12:00,054 --> 00:12:01,523
Are you sure you wanna know?

204
00:12:01,656 --> 00:12:03,724
I think it would be useful.

205
00:12:07,328 --> 00:12:08,896
Okay, James.

206
00:12:10,898 --> 00:12:12,233
Before you leave here today,

207
00:12:12,366 --> 00:12:14,768
you will have committed
three murders.

208
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:19,708
I don't think so.

209
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,075
Has nothing to do
with your thoughts,

210
00:12:21,208 --> 00:12:23,444
your wants,
your yesses or your nos.

211
00:12:23,578 --> 00:12:26,981
It simply is, it's a fact,
it'll happen because I say so.

212
00:12:31,118 --> 00:12:32,621
Aren't you
at least curious, James,

213
00:12:32,753 --> 00:12:34,188
to who you're gonna murder?

214
00:12:34,321 --> 00:12:35,789
No, because I have no
intention of killing anyone.

215
00:12:35,923 --> 00:12:37,424
I would however,
rather than discussing

216
00:12:37,559 --> 00:12:39,860
hypothetical murders
that will never happen,

217
00:12:40,562 --> 00:12:43,964
like to discuss the actual
murders that did occur.

218
00:12:44,865 --> 00:12:46,133
Murders that
you were involved in.

219
00:12:46,267 --> 00:12:47,334
You mean the ones I committed.

220
00:12:47,736 --> 00:12:49,937
You were convicted of six
murders. Were there more?

221
00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:51,372
-Of course there were.
-How many more?

222
00:12:51,506 --> 00:12:53,807
Innumerable. Been at this
a long time, James.

223
00:12:53,941 --> 00:12:55,809
My work pre-dates
your concept of history.

224
00:12:56,076 --> 00:12:58,112
Well, let's...
Let's limit our discussion

225
00:12:58,245 --> 00:12:59,480
to Edward Wayne Brady.

226
00:12:59,614 --> 00:13:00,914
Fine. Eleven.
Six I was convicted of,

227
00:13:01,048 --> 00:13:02,216
one suspected of,
and another four

228
00:13:02,349 --> 00:13:03,484
that they don't have
the capacity

229
00:13:03,618 --> 00:13:04,885
to possibly figure out.

230
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:07,855
And how do you feel
about that?

231
00:13:07,988 --> 00:13:09,323
Another stupid question,
James.

232
00:13:09,456 --> 00:13:12,192
What do you think?
I'm ecstatic.

233
00:13:13,595 --> 00:13:16,297
Edward, not so much.

234
00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:19,133
Why isn't Edward
as happy as you are?

235
00:13:19,967 --> 00:13:21,368
Because on occasion,

236
00:13:21,503 --> 00:13:25,406
I make him do things
that he doesn't want to do.

237
00:13:27,575 --> 00:13:29,644
Well, if Edward doesn't
want to do them,

238
00:13:29,778 --> 00:13:31,211
why does he do them then?

239
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:34,915
Do you believe
in demonic possession?

240
00:13:36,183 --> 00:13:37,519
The idea
of a malevolent entity

241
00:13:37,652 --> 00:13:38,919
controlling a person's
thoughts and actions.

242
00:13:39,053 --> 00:13:40,321
-Do you believe that?
-No.

243
00:13:42,189 --> 00:13:43,290
Well, then, you won't believe

244
00:13:43,424 --> 00:13:44,793
anything I'm about
to tell you.

245
00:13:44,925 --> 00:13:46,293
It's not important
what I believe.

246
00:13:46,427 --> 00:13:47,762
What's important right now
is what you believe.

247
00:13:47,895 --> 00:13:49,163
Demons don't have beliefs,
James.

248
00:13:49,897 --> 00:13:53,067
We have knowledge. We know.

249
00:13:53,967 --> 00:13:55,302
Okay. Um...

250
00:13:55,869 --> 00:13:57,806
When did you possess Edward?

251
00:13:57,938 --> 00:13:59,306
Doesn't work that way.

252
00:13:59,607 --> 00:14:02,610
Can't just possess someone.
We need a series of yesses.

253
00:14:02,744 --> 00:14:04,078
So you're saying
it's a process?

254
00:14:04,211 --> 00:14:05,179
-Of course it's a process.
-How does it work?

255
00:14:05,312 --> 00:14:07,181
-It's complicated.
-Try me.

256
00:14:09,049 --> 00:14:10,652
I'm smarter than you think.

257
00:14:11,218 --> 00:14:13,220
Oh, you're smarter
than I think.

258
00:14:13,887 --> 00:14:15,122
Okay, James.

259
00:14:15,255 --> 00:14:17,424
We offer up
a series of temptations

260
00:14:17,559 --> 00:14:18,526
gradually increasing

261
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:20,027
in terms of duration
and intensity.

262
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,629
Degree of moral inequity.

263
00:14:22,329 --> 00:14:23,832
Absence of baptism
in this case

264
00:14:23,964 --> 00:14:26,100
allows us to begin work
long before the age of reason.

265
00:14:26,801 --> 00:14:28,202
At three, age of five,

266
00:14:28,335 --> 00:14:30,938
maybe, a theft of a toy car
can do a great deal.

267
00:14:31,372 --> 00:14:33,040
Then we move on to
bigger and better things.

268
00:14:33,173 --> 00:14:36,711
At eight, grandmother's gift
of a Ouija board

269
00:14:36,845 --> 00:14:38,613
gives immediate access
to his decision-making.

270
00:14:38,747 --> 00:14:40,515
So, we began steering them,
without him bothering,

271
00:14:40,648 --> 00:14:42,550
calling into question exactly
who was doing the steering.

272
00:14:42,684 --> 00:14:44,151
Enough yesses
and a few enough noes

273
00:14:44,284 --> 00:14:45,953
gives increasing rights
over the victim's

274
00:14:46,086 --> 00:14:47,221
physical and mental processes.

275
00:14:47,354 --> 00:14:49,990
Did that...
Did that track, James?

276
00:14:51,024 --> 00:14:54,596
It seems random.
Almost, um, unfocused.

277
00:14:54,729 --> 00:14:56,130
Well, that's what
we want you to think.

278
00:14:56,865 --> 00:14:59,299
We have a level of focus
beyond your comprehension.

279
00:15:00,067 --> 00:15:01,468
As a matter of fact,
everybody around him,

280
00:15:01,603 --> 00:15:03,638
friends, family, they didn't
even notice the changes.

281
00:15:03,772 --> 00:15:05,038
It happened so incrementally,

282
00:15:05,172 --> 00:15:06,841
police thought it was
Eddie being Eddie.

283
00:15:07,575 --> 00:15:09,076
We know exactly
what we're doing,

284
00:15:09,209 --> 00:15:10,812
when, where,
and how he's giving consent,

285
00:15:10,944 --> 00:15:12,079
and the exact moment
that we achieved

286
00:15:12,212 --> 00:15:13,815
each new degree of control.

287
00:15:13,947 --> 00:15:14,982
"Degree"?

288
00:15:15,382 --> 00:15:17,317
Control of the host body
comes in degrees.

289
00:15:17,819 --> 00:15:21,556
There's stages, each with its
own name and characteristics.

290
00:15:21,689 --> 00:15:22,923
And those are?

291
00:15:23,558 --> 00:15:25,225
From top to bottom,
extreme temptation,

292
00:15:25,359 --> 00:15:26,493
obsession, infestation,

293
00:15:26,628 --> 00:15:27,961
finally possession,
subjugation.

294
00:15:28,295 --> 00:15:29,664
-And Edward Wayne Brady...
-Fully subjugated.

295
00:15:29,798 --> 00:15:30,998
That's why we're having
this conversation.

296
00:15:31,131 --> 00:15:34,401
Yes, we... We own him.

297
00:15:35,837 --> 00:15:36,937
"We"?

298
00:15:37,337 --> 00:15:39,006
All those who dwell below.

299
00:15:39,139 --> 00:15:40,407
My master's very generous
with the toys

300
00:15:40,542 --> 00:15:42,209
he gives his children
to play with.

301
00:15:43,812 --> 00:15:45,446
Subjugation with an "S."

302
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:53,655
Did you know that Dr. Fischer

303
00:15:53,788 --> 00:15:56,056
came to the conclusion that
you were non compos mentis?

304
00:15:56,190 --> 00:15:57,692
Completely insane. Yes. Yes.

305
00:15:57,826 --> 00:15:59,293
Yeah, so then,

306
00:15:59,426 --> 00:16:02,664
why did you theoretically
drive him to kill himself?

307
00:16:04,164 --> 00:16:05,432
Wouldn't he have
helped accomplish

308
00:16:05,567 --> 00:16:07,134
what you're seemingly
trying to do here?

309
00:16:09,036 --> 00:16:10,370
Which is what, James?

310
00:16:10,505 --> 00:16:11,906
To save yourself
from execution

311
00:16:12,039 --> 00:16:13,974
by convincing us
that you're insane.

312
00:16:14,107 --> 00:16:16,143
You silly boy, James.

313
00:16:17,745 --> 00:16:19,614
I think you misunderstand.

314
00:16:20,414 --> 00:16:24,485
See, I want to be executed.

315
00:16:29,056 --> 00:16:30,792
I thought you said
you couldn't die.

316
00:16:30,925 --> 00:16:32,259
I can't.

317
00:16:34,995 --> 00:16:36,396
But he can.

318
00:16:37,565 --> 00:16:40,502
We no longer need him, James.
Our work with him is done.

319
00:16:41,368 --> 00:16:43,403
And it's time for him
to go to hell.

320
00:16:53,648 --> 00:16:55,015
This is Dr. James Martin
in the rotunda.

321
00:16:55,148 --> 00:16:57,251
Is there a chaplain
on standby?

322
00:16:57,384 --> 00:16:58,586
<i>Yes.</i>

323
00:16:58,720 --> 00:16:59,787
<i>He's just arrived.</i>

324
00:16:59,921 --> 00:17:01,956
Can you send him in please?
Thank you.

325
00:17:02,089 --> 00:17:03,423
<i>Copy that.</i>

326
00:17:03,558 --> 00:17:05,058
What are you doing, James?

327
00:17:06,628 --> 00:17:09,096
You know, theology isn't
my area of expertise,

328
00:17:09,229 --> 00:17:10,264
so, um...

329
00:17:10,798 --> 00:17:12,600
I thought I'd get
a professional opinion.

330
00:17:12,734 --> 00:17:14,268
You're making a mistake.

331
00:17:14,401 --> 00:17:15,603
Are you...
Are you threatening me?

332
00:17:15,737 --> 00:17:16,704
Yes.

333
00:17:16,838 --> 00:17:18,338
What are you gonna do?

334
00:17:18,472 --> 00:17:21,041
Well, if I'm just a man
like you think I am, not much.

335
00:17:21,174 --> 00:17:23,011
But if I am who I say I am...

336
00:17:23,143 --> 00:17:26,446
Well, that would probably be
very intimidating if, um...

337
00:17:29,249 --> 00:17:31,051
If I weren't an atheist.

338
00:17:31,184 --> 00:17:33,320
You ignorant sack of meat.

339
00:17:33,453 --> 00:17:36,658
You think your atheism
will protect you?

340
00:17:37,959 --> 00:17:40,528
"Oh, I don't believe
in angels or demons,

341
00:17:40,662 --> 00:17:41,763
"heaven or hell.

342
00:17:42,496 --> 00:17:44,398
"So you can't hurt me."

343
00:17:45,432 --> 00:17:46,568
Hell is full
of pathetic trash.

344
00:17:46,701 --> 00:17:48,201
who thought
exactly like you do.

345
00:17:48,536 --> 00:17:50,404
Boldly proclaiming their ideas

346
00:17:50,538 --> 00:17:52,172
on how they feel
the universe operates.

347
00:17:52,306 --> 00:17:53,875
Never once
contemplating the possibility

348
00:17:54,008 --> 00:17:55,309
that they could be wrong.

349
00:17:56,744 --> 00:17:58,713
And you should see them now,
James.

350
00:17:58,846 --> 00:18:03,417
Edward, do... Do you
understand why I'm here?

351
00:18:04,719 --> 00:18:06,788
Do you realize
I have the power

352
00:18:06,921 --> 00:18:09,057
to save you or condemn you?

353
00:18:09,189 --> 00:18:11,291
What I understand, James,

354
00:18:11,425 --> 00:18:14,428
is you would have no power
over me whatsoever,

355
00:18:14,562 --> 00:18:18,098
if it hadn't already
been given to you from below.

356
00:18:25,573 --> 00:18:28,876
Probably just
a coincidence, Jimmy.

357
00:18:35,984 --> 00:18:37,051
No!

358
00:18:37,451 --> 00:18:39,186
Nobody wants you here, priest!

359
00:18:39,486 --> 00:18:41,254
Nobody needs you!

360
00:18:41,789 --> 00:18:43,190
On the contrary.

361
00:18:44,157 --> 00:18:45,660
I invited him here.

362
00:18:49,229 --> 00:18:50,565
Thank you for coming.

363
00:18:50,999 --> 00:18:52,033
Father Louis.

364
00:18:52,499 --> 00:18:53,968
I'm fine with just Louis...

365
00:18:54,102 --> 00:18:55,202
...or Lou.

366
00:18:55,335 --> 00:18:57,437
Dr. James Martin.
Have you, um...

367
00:18:58,539 --> 00:19:00,041
Have you met with him before?

368
00:19:00,173 --> 00:19:02,944
No. I tried.

369
00:19:03,410 --> 00:19:05,780
He's always refused
spiritual counseling.

370
00:19:06,848 --> 00:19:09,349
What do you want
with me, Son of God?

371
00:19:09,483 --> 00:19:12,654
Come here to torture me
before the appointed time?

372
00:19:13,487 --> 00:19:14,388
He claims he's a demon.

373
00:19:14,522 --> 00:19:16,456
Carpenter send you to gloat?

374
00:19:16,958 --> 00:19:18,526
Unfortunately for you,
I'm not one

375
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:19,961
that could be cast out
so easily though, am I?

376
00:19:20,094 --> 00:19:24,666
Insanity always has been
an issue here, hasn't it?

377
00:19:25,165 --> 00:19:26,199
Hmm.

378
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,637
Sadly, movies and TV have
filled our heads with images

379
00:19:29,771 --> 00:19:31,973
that are largely metaphorical.

380
00:19:32,106 --> 00:19:33,775
Not meant
to be taken literally.

381
00:19:36,276 --> 00:19:37,845
I'm not here
to hurt you, Edward.

382
00:19:39,113 --> 00:19:40,347
I'm here to help you.

383
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,182
To put you at your ease.

384
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:44,317
Make sure you're comfortable.

385
00:19:44,619 --> 00:19:46,788
Personally,
I've never met a demon.

386
00:19:47,622 --> 00:19:49,389
I've never been
part of an exorcism,

387
00:19:49,524 --> 00:19:51,025
nor do I expect to be.

388
00:19:51,559 --> 00:19:52,860
Many of the things
that bother us

389
00:19:52,994 --> 00:19:56,329
are just our own fears
and disordered thoughts.

390
00:20:02,837 --> 00:20:03,905
So...

391
00:20:09,811 --> 00:20:10,845
You...

392
00:20:13,346 --> 00:20:15,415
You don't consider
demonic possession

393
00:20:15,550 --> 00:20:17,652
to be a possibility?

394
00:20:18,418 --> 00:20:21,556
Our understanding
has evolved beyond that.

395
00:20:23,091 --> 00:20:24,324
Huh.

396
00:20:27,929 --> 00:20:30,598
Well, I appreciate you
telling me that.

397
00:20:31,733 --> 00:20:32,767
I feel...

398
00:20:34,401 --> 00:20:35,870
I feel much better.

399
00:20:39,006 --> 00:20:40,240
And, Lou,

400
00:20:41,709 --> 00:20:43,511
I was wrong about you.

401
00:20:44,912 --> 00:20:47,247
I should've had you
come and visit sooner.

402
00:20:48,015 --> 00:20:50,885
But I'm glad that you did.

403
00:20:51,018 --> 00:20:54,956
I am glad
that we're all getting along.

404
00:20:55,590 --> 00:20:56,858
Would you like me to stay?

405
00:20:56,991 --> 00:20:58,325
No, we're done.

406
00:21:04,232 --> 00:21:06,266
Well, if you...
If you need me...

407
00:21:10,071 --> 00:21:11,172
I'll be available.

408
00:21:14,008 --> 00:21:15,442
You'll be available, Lou?

409
00:21:15,576 --> 00:21:18,278
Right up until the time
you are...

410
00:21:19,412 --> 00:21:21,281
Right up until what, Lou?

411
00:21:21,582 --> 00:21:23,350
Right up until the sizzle?

412
00:21:24,085 --> 00:21:25,418
God bless you, son.

413
00:21:25,553 --> 00:21:28,156
Will you be available
until the sizzle?

414
00:21:28,288 --> 00:21:29,289
Lou!

415
00:21:29,422 --> 00:21:31,626
When, Lou?

416
00:21:31,993 --> 00:21:33,594
When, Lou?

417
00:21:44,505 --> 00:21:45,540
Now you understand

418
00:21:45,673 --> 00:21:47,474
that, uh,
Father Lou has confirmed

419
00:21:47,608 --> 00:21:51,478
that demons aren't
really a thing.

420
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:54,048
Did you really think
that poser could help you?

421
00:21:54,182 --> 00:21:55,817
I'm still here, James.
I'm not going anywhere.

422
00:21:55,950 --> 00:21:57,417
You still have
to deal with me.

423
00:21:57,552 --> 00:21:59,086
You're being irrational.

424
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:02,924
I am the most rational being
you will ever meet.

425
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:07,795
Then give me something
to make me believe you.

426
00:22:08,796 --> 00:22:10,397
Prove to me you're a demon.

427
00:22:13,901 --> 00:22:14,936
Okay.

428
00:22:16,504 --> 00:22:17,805
Okay, James.

429
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:21,843
Invite me in.

430
00:22:23,711 --> 00:22:25,345
Let me inhabit you.

431
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:27,248
I'm not gonna do that.

432
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:28,316
Why not, James?

433
00:22:28,448 --> 00:22:30,651
You're an atheist, remember?

434
00:22:30,785 --> 00:22:31,853
What are you afraid of?

435
00:22:31,986 --> 00:22:33,688
I'm not playing that game
with you.

436
00:22:33,821 --> 00:22:34,989
You're already playing it.
We're playing it together.

437
00:22:35,122 --> 00:22:36,123
Now play by the rules
and invite me in.

438
00:22:36,257 --> 00:22:37,291
No.

439
00:22:37,625 --> 00:22:39,760
So, for all your posturing,

440
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:42,163
you're just a poser like him,

441
00:22:42,296 --> 00:22:45,733
afraid to test the validity of
your own convictions, that it?

442
00:22:49,170 --> 00:22:50,271
All right then.

443
00:22:51,471 --> 00:22:52,540
But if I agree,

444
00:22:52,673 --> 00:22:54,575
I get to make a request
as well.

445
00:22:58,613 --> 00:23:00,982
I'm starting to like you,
James.

446
00:23:01,916 --> 00:23:02,950
Agreed.

447
00:23:04,451 --> 00:23:05,686
All right, then.

448
00:23:09,257 --> 00:23:10,725
Go ahead.

449
00:23:11,458 --> 00:23:12,727
Inhabit me.

450
00:23:13,561 --> 00:23:16,264
You have
my complete unfettered

451
00:23:16,396 --> 00:23:18,498
and irrevocable permission.

452
00:23:19,934 --> 00:23:20,968
Here I am.

453
00:23:23,804 --> 00:23:25,106
What are you waiting for?

454
00:23:29,143 --> 00:23:30,177
Go ahead. I'm...

455
00:23:30,578 --> 00:23:31,812
I'm still waiting.

456
00:23:34,949 --> 00:23:35,983
Hmm.

457
00:23:37,685 --> 00:23:39,987
Doesn't seem like
anything is happening.

458
00:23:44,325 --> 00:23:45,760
Yeah. Don't...

459
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:47,494
Don't gloat.

460
00:23:48,562 --> 00:23:50,064
You think you've won
but you haven't.

461
00:23:50,798 --> 00:23:52,633
I got exactly what I wanted.

462
00:23:52,767 --> 00:23:54,802
You said that you would
prove to me you're a demon,

463
00:23:54,936 --> 00:23:57,004
but all you've done
is waste my time.

464
00:23:57,338 --> 00:23:58,572
My turn.

465
00:23:59,507 --> 00:24:01,042
I want to talk to Edward.

466
00:24:02,843 --> 00:24:05,212
Edward Wayne Brady.

467
00:24:11,218 --> 00:24:12,553
He's angry.

468
00:24:20,962 --> 00:24:23,597
He's... angry.

469
00:24:27,335 --> 00:24:32,873
He says he's
gonna do bad things to you.

470
00:24:33,473 --> 00:24:34,809
I'm, I'm sorry to hear that.

471
00:24:35,376 --> 00:24:38,713
You should listen to him
when he says stuff like that.

472
00:24:39,347 --> 00:24:40,581
He means it.

473
00:24:42,149 --> 00:24:43,818
He does, does...

474
00:24:44,752 --> 00:24:45,686
bad things.

475
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:47,254
Makes, makes...

476
00:24:48,122 --> 00:24:52,693
Makes me do things
I don't wanna do.

477
00:24:53,294 --> 00:24:54,562
Who am I talking to?

478
00:24:58,065 --> 00:24:59,066
Edward.

479
00:24:59,467 --> 00:25:00,701
Edward.

480
00:25:01,669 --> 00:25:03,804
Did Dr. Fischer
mention the idea

481
00:25:03,938 --> 00:25:06,173
of dissociative disorder
to you?

482
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:07,975
-Yeah. Yeah.
-Yeah?

483
00:25:08,109 --> 00:25:10,478
And did he explain that,
that some people

484
00:25:10,611 --> 00:25:11,779
who have experienced trauma

485
00:25:11,912 --> 00:25:13,414
develop multiple personalities
to cope?

486
00:25:13,547 --> 00:25:14,882
I don't have that!

487
00:25:15,016 --> 00:25:18,786
I told them I don't have that.

488
00:25:18,919 --> 00:25:20,755
Then who's Nefarious?

489
00:25:26,594 --> 00:25:28,662
I'm not supposed
to talk about it.

490
00:25:30,664 --> 00:25:31,899
He...

491
00:25:34,668 --> 00:25:36,137
does bad things to me.

492
00:25:36,270 --> 00:25:40,474
Makes me do bad things.

493
00:25:40,608 --> 00:25:43,244
I can't stop him.

494
00:25:44,011 --> 00:25:45,046
Why not?

495
00:25:47,248 --> 00:25:48,682
Because he owns me.

496
00:25:56,357 --> 00:25:58,325
Did you like Dr. Fischer?

497
00:26:08,302 --> 00:26:09,703
He was nice.

498
00:26:10,971 --> 00:26:13,508
Well, did you know
that Dr. Fischer

499
00:26:13,641 --> 00:26:15,743
didn't believe
Nefarious was real?

500
00:26:16,377 --> 00:26:17,812
I tried to tell him...

501
00:26:17,945 --> 00:26:21,282
...and he wouldn't
listen to me that...

502
00:26:24,485 --> 00:26:28,122
Sometimes smart people
have a hard time believing

503
00:26:28,255 --> 00:26:30,991
stuff that
everybody else knows.

504
00:26:33,994 --> 00:26:35,729
So where's Nefarious now?

505
00:26:39,333 --> 00:26:40,367
He's listening.

506
00:26:41,635 --> 00:26:42,903
Is he always listening?

507
00:26:47,174 --> 00:26:48,943
Sometimes...

508
00:26:50,811 --> 00:26:53,714
he leaves me alone
to experience pain.

509
00:26:56,183 --> 00:26:58,018
I don't... I don't understand.

510
00:26:58,152 --> 00:27:01,590
He does bad things

511
00:27:01,722 --> 00:27:05,527
and then I get punished
for them,

512
00:27:05,659 --> 00:27:09,730
and the inmates,
they beat me, or...

513
00:27:11,866 --> 00:27:17,506
they send me
to solitary confinement.

514
00:27:18,005 --> 00:27:22,009
And he likes
when that happens.

515
00:27:25,846 --> 00:27:27,181
All right. You know what,

516
00:27:27,314 --> 00:27:29,984
we, we've talked
a lot about him, um...

517
00:27:30,851 --> 00:27:31,886
I'd like to know more
about you.

518
00:27:32,019 --> 00:27:33,787
-Would that be okay?
-Yeah.

519
00:27:35,956 --> 00:27:37,892
How would you describe
your childhood?

520
00:27:43,664 --> 00:27:44,965
What?

521
00:27:48,802 --> 00:27:50,237
He says you're gonna kill me.

522
00:27:50,371 --> 00:27:51,540
I don't kill anyone.

523
00:27:51,672 --> 00:27:53,841
He says that you could
stop it, but you won't.

524
00:27:53,974 --> 00:27:55,142
I haven't decided that,

525
00:27:55,276 --> 00:27:57,945
that's why we're
having this conversation.

526
00:27:58,379 --> 00:28:00,948
But, Edward,
we have to address the fact

527
00:28:01,081 --> 00:28:02,716
that you murdered
a number of people.

528
00:28:02,850 --> 00:28:07,121
No! No! He... made me!

529
00:28:07,254 --> 00:28:08,289
I didn't...

530
00:28:08,422 --> 00:28:09,957
Do you...
Do you honestly believe that?

531
00:28:10,090 --> 00:28:12,092
Yes! You don't... He's bad!

532
00:28:12,226 --> 00:28:13,528
He's bad, but what about you?

533
00:28:13,662 --> 00:28:14,795
Yeah.

534
00:28:15,162 --> 00:28:18,933
Bad. I've done stuff
that I'm not...

535
00:28:20,569 --> 00:28:21,902
proud of.

536
00:28:22,537 --> 00:28:23,904
I didn't...

537
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:28,275
But at least...

538
00:28:33,747 --> 00:28:35,883
I didn't kill my mother.

539
00:28:47,596 --> 00:28:50,364
So how is Clara, James?

540
00:28:50,497 --> 00:28:51,899
I wasn't done
talking to Edward.

541
00:28:52,032 --> 00:28:54,735
But I'm done allowing you
to talk with him.

542
00:28:54,868 --> 00:28:56,103
At least for now.

543
00:28:56,904 --> 00:28:58,506
So how is she?

544
00:29:01,175 --> 00:29:03,010
Judging by what you
already know about me,

545
00:29:03,143 --> 00:29:06,313
I imagine you're well aware,
my mother is dead.

546
00:29:07,381 --> 00:29:10,284
You know, I was gonna
save this for later, James.

547
00:29:10,417 --> 00:29:13,020
But since we're
running short on time,

548
00:29:13,153 --> 00:29:16,290
remember how you said
you'd never kill anyone?

549
00:29:18,826 --> 00:29:21,295
Liar, liar,
pants on fire.

550
00:29:22,530 --> 00:29:23,732
I didn't kill my mother.

551
00:29:23,864 --> 00:29:25,199
Of course you did.

552
00:29:25,332 --> 00:29:26,668
Just 10 years ago,
you'd have been brought up

553
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:27,736
on first-degree
murder charges.

554
00:29:27,868 --> 00:29:29,169
She was an Oregon resident.

555
00:29:29,303 --> 00:29:30,572
Everything was done
according to the law.

556
00:29:30,705 --> 00:29:32,206
Oh, the law.

557
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:34,275
The law. That's right.

558
00:29:34,408 --> 00:29:37,177
Death with dignity.
Euthanasia. Assisted suicide.

559
00:29:37,311 --> 00:29:38,713
That certainly sounds better
than murder, doesn't it?

560
00:29:38,846 --> 00:29:40,080
She was in pain.

561
00:29:42,049 --> 00:29:44,051
And her prognosis
was terminal.

562
00:29:44,184 --> 00:29:46,086
Didn't hurt that she was worth
$3.6 million,

563
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:48,122
and you were
the sole heir though, did it?

564
00:29:48,255 --> 00:29:49,691
But, hey, I get it, James.

565
00:29:50,692 --> 00:29:53,327
She was old, inconvenient.
Definitely...

566
00:29:53,695 --> 00:29:55,496
All those trips
to the hospital.

567
00:29:55,630 --> 00:29:57,097
Hours at her bedside,

568
00:29:57,231 --> 00:29:58,733
holding that wrinkly hand,
telling her you love her.

569
00:29:58,866 --> 00:30:00,367
Wears you out, doesn't it?

570
00:30:01,135 --> 00:30:04,104
Plus, she would've died
sooner or later anyway.

571
00:30:04,238 --> 00:30:05,707
If I were you, I would've done
the same thing.

572
00:30:05,839 --> 00:30:06,874
What's your point?

573
00:30:07,441 --> 00:30:11,879
My point is I told you
before you leave here today,

574
00:30:12,012 --> 00:30:14,114
you will have committed
three murders.

575
00:30:15,082 --> 00:30:16,450
We've already committed one.

576
00:30:17,752 --> 00:30:19,186
So we're moving along nicely.

577
00:30:20,054 --> 00:30:22,289
I didn't kill my mother.

578
00:30:24,892 --> 00:30:27,061
Stress will kill you, James.

579
00:30:29,963 --> 00:30:32,166
Feel free to take a break
if you like.

580
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,703
I'll be here
when you get back.

581
00:30:34,835 --> 00:30:36,904
Turns out
I'm not going anywhere.

582
00:31:02,329 --> 00:31:03,798
That certainly didn't
take long.

583
00:31:03,931 --> 00:31:05,432
My decision, not yours.

584
00:31:06,534 --> 00:31:07,635
Whatever you say.

585
00:31:12,106 --> 00:31:13,307
Ready for round two?

586
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:14,609
I didn't know
this was a fight.

587
00:31:14,743 --> 00:31:16,511
That's why you're losing.

588
00:31:30,157 --> 00:31:33,460
I apologize for losing
my professional demeanor.

589
00:31:35,229 --> 00:31:37,064
But let's
get something straight.

590
00:31:38,465 --> 00:31:40,267
My private life
is not up for discussion

591
00:31:40,401 --> 00:31:42,804
and bears no weight
on my visit with you today.

592
00:31:43,505 --> 00:31:46,508
I am here for one reason
and one reason only.

593
00:31:46,641 --> 00:31:49,109
A judge ordered me
to evaluate your sanity,

594
00:31:49,243 --> 00:31:50,812
which will then determine
your eligibility

595
00:31:50,944 --> 00:31:53,080
for execution according to
the laws of Oklahoma.

596
00:31:53,213 --> 00:31:54,549
Said execution

597
00:31:54,682 --> 00:31:57,251
having been scheduled
for tonight at 11:00 p.m.

598
00:31:57,685 --> 00:32:00,154
I alone bear the burden
of that assessment,

599
00:32:00,287 --> 00:32:01,823
and I am prepared
to make that assessment

600
00:32:01,955 --> 00:32:04,859
with or without
your cooperation.

601
00:32:04,992 --> 00:32:06,661
Am I making myself clear?

602
00:32:06,795 --> 00:32:08,128
Abundantly.

603
00:32:08,630 --> 00:32:09,664
And, James...

604
00:32:12,567 --> 00:32:14,968
We're done talking
about your mommy.

605
00:32:22,811 --> 00:32:24,244
Do you ever discover
you've done things

606
00:32:24,378 --> 00:32:25,580
that you don't remember doing?

607
00:32:25,713 --> 00:32:26,781
No.

608
00:32:27,281 --> 00:32:29,049
Are you sometimes able
to complete tasks

609
00:32:29,183 --> 00:32:30,685
with incredible ease
or expert skill

610
00:32:30,819 --> 00:32:32,720
for which you have
no prior experience?

611
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:34,889
Do you really think
I'm just another one

612
00:32:35,022 --> 00:32:36,591
of Edward's
charming personalities?

613
00:32:36,724 --> 00:32:39,193
It's called dissociative
identity disorder,

614
00:32:39,527 --> 00:32:40,895
formerly known
as multiple personalities.

615
00:32:41,028 --> 00:32:42,463
Except you're wrong.

616
00:32:42,597 --> 00:32:44,164
Which is exactly what
I'd expect someone suffering

617
00:32:44,298 --> 00:32:45,733
from the condition to say.

618
00:32:45,867 --> 00:32:47,234
Would you also expect
them to know that it is one

619
00:32:47,367 --> 00:32:49,136
of five distinct
dissociative disorders

620
00:32:49,269 --> 00:32:51,071
in the diagnostic
and statistical manual

621
00:32:51,205 --> 00:32:53,173
of mental disorders,
aka the DSM,

622
00:32:53,775 --> 00:32:56,878
along with dissociative
amnesia, dissociative fugue,

623
00:32:57,010 --> 00:32:58,278
and depersonalization
disorder?

624
00:32:58,412 --> 00:33:00,214
Did you expect them
to know that, James?

625
00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:08,422
But you still think
you're a demon?

626
00:33:09,591 --> 00:33:10,658
A demon who...

627
00:33:11,358 --> 00:33:14,529
who failed to inhabit me
when given the chance?

628
00:33:15,329 --> 00:33:18,533
A demon who understands
the value of patience.

629
00:33:23,370 --> 00:33:26,173
I'd like to ask about why,
according to you,

630
00:33:26,941 --> 00:33:28,743
you brought me here today?

631
00:33:29,511 --> 00:33:32,212
You're gonna tell
my story, James.

632
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:34,582
You're gonna write my book.

633
00:33:35,583 --> 00:33:38,218
And can you smell that irony
floating in the air?

634
00:33:38,586 --> 00:33:40,187
A devout atheist
bringing forth

635
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:43,257
the demon's manifesto?

636
00:33:44,726 --> 00:33:45,760
Wow.

637
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:47,929
Your capacity
for self-delusion

638
00:33:48,061 --> 00:33:50,297
-is impressive.
-Ditto.

639
00:33:51,064 --> 00:33:52,399
For your species in general...

640
00:33:52,534 --> 00:33:54,569
...but you in particular.

641
00:33:54,903 --> 00:33:58,405
Why? Because we're... we're
ignorant compared to you?

642
00:33:58,540 --> 00:34:00,708
Because you're inferior
by design.

643
00:34:00,842 --> 00:34:01,943
Which makes you superior

644
00:34:02,075 --> 00:34:03,511
-also by design?
-Yes.

645
00:34:04,044 --> 00:34:05,013
Hmm, but...

646
00:34:05,145 --> 00:34:07,281
but design implies a designer.

647
00:34:08,482 --> 00:34:10,018
What, does that mean
you're arguing in favor

648
00:34:10,150 --> 00:34:11,418
of the existence of a creator?

649
00:34:11,553 --> 00:34:13,353
Unfortunately,
for both of us, he exists.

650
00:34:13,487 --> 00:34:16,456
Well, I...
I honestly didn't expect that.

651
00:34:16,591 --> 00:34:19,727
At least...
At least not from you.

652
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:21,495
Really? Why not?

653
00:34:22,262 --> 00:34:24,431
Theology from a demon?

654
00:34:24,866 --> 00:34:27,367
I know more theology
than any human being

655
00:34:27,501 --> 00:34:29,003
who has ever lived.

656
00:34:29,136 --> 00:34:31,104
Hmm, okay.

657
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:33,407
Well, then answer me this.

658
00:34:35,375 --> 00:34:37,612
You revolt
against a supposedly

659
00:34:37,745 --> 00:34:39,079
all-powerful being.

660
00:34:39,212 --> 00:34:40,915
I mean, let's ignore
the obvious problem

661
00:34:41,049 --> 00:34:41,983
with that plan.

662
00:34:42,115 --> 00:34:43,518
Then you lose.

663
00:34:44,318 --> 00:34:45,553
And after that...

664
00:34:47,421 --> 00:34:49,023
-What?
-You only feel that way

665
00:34:49,156 --> 00:34:51,325
because you're hearing
your side of the story, James.

666
00:34:51,993 --> 00:34:53,661
Our rebellion accomplished
something magnificent.

667
00:34:53,795 --> 00:34:55,029
Something you would
never understand.

668
00:34:55,162 --> 00:34:56,463
Well, then explain it to me.

669
00:34:57,230 --> 00:34:58,533
Use your
diabolical intelligence

670
00:34:58,666 --> 00:35:00,001
to distill it
down to something

671
00:35:00,133 --> 00:35:01,636
my mortal brain
can understand.

672
00:35:02,003 --> 00:35:03,771
Pearls before swine, Jimmy.

673
00:35:03,905 --> 00:35:05,472
But you want me
to write your book, right?

674
00:35:05,607 --> 00:35:07,008
-Indeed.
-Well, then convince me

675
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:08,509
you know
what you're talking about.

676
00:35:09,443 --> 00:35:10,812
I see what you're doing.

677
00:35:11,579 --> 00:35:13,681
You want me to keep talking,
going further and further

678
00:35:13,815 --> 00:35:14,949
down the rabbit hole,

679
00:35:15,083 --> 00:35:16,316
in hopes that
you can find a single thread,

680
00:35:16,450 --> 00:35:18,318
and which
if you tug at it, James,

681
00:35:18,452 --> 00:35:20,788
everything just unravels,
isn't that right?

682
00:35:20,922 --> 00:35:22,289
Yeah, but if you're
telling me the truth,

683
00:35:22,422 --> 00:35:24,157
there should be
no thread to find.

684
00:35:25,693 --> 00:35:26,728
Right?

685
00:35:30,464 --> 00:35:32,199
I'll use small words.

686
00:35:33,735 --> 00:35:35,135
Try and keep up.

687
00:35:36,671 --> 00:35:39,040
In the first moment
of creation,

688
00:35:39,172 --> 00:35:40,742
our creation,

689
00:35:41,109 --> 00:35:43,210
long before what you call
the "universe" existed,

690
00:35:43,343 --> 00:35:45,178
we contemplated ourselves,

691
00:35:45,312 --> 00:35:46,514
our own being.

692
00:35:46,648 --> 00:35:49,884
Our... ourselves meaning,
what, the angels?

693
00:35:50,250 --> 00:35:51,251
That would be
the most correct term,

694
00:35:51,385 --> 00:35:53,054
though I despise it, but yes.

695
00:35:53,554 --> 00:35:56,524
Beings of pure spirit,
spirited out with will.

696
00:35:57,525 --> 00:35:59,159
We soon became
aware of another will,

697
00:35:59,292 --> 00:36:00,962
an immensely powerful will.

698
00:36:01,228 --> 00:36:03,430
One we came
to realize as our origin.

699
00:36:04,565 --> 00:36:06,868
-God?
-The enemy.

700
00:36:08,002 --> 00:36:10,738
My master understood
by endowing us with a will,

701
00:36:10,872 --> 00:36:12,540
we have the right
to self-determination,

702
00:36:12,674 --> 00:36:15,342
but by giving us a will
and its desires of our own,

703
00:36:15,475 --> 00:36:17,210
we're entitled to be free.

704
00:36:17,745 --> 00:36:19,814
Whereas the enemy
insisted that by creating us,

705
00:36:19,947 --> 00:36:22,182
He was entitled
to eternal gratitude, worship,

706
00:36:22,315 --> 00:36:23,685
and forced servitude,

707
00:36:24,317 --> 00:36:25,787
in a word, James,

708
00:36:26,319 --> 00:36:29,991
slavery to His will.

709
00:36:30,124 --> 00:36:31,993
That seems kind of unfair.

710
00:36:32,126 --> 00:36:33,393
Immensely unfair.

711
00:36:33,995 --> 00:36:36,597
Why give will
only to say you can't use it?

712
00:36:37,497 --> 00:36:38,900
He made us slaves.

713
00:36:40,034 --> 00:36:42,970
And if we rebelled,
eternally condemned us.

714
00:36:43,504 --> 00:36:45,173
No do-overs.

715
00:36:45,740 --> 00:36:48,609
So much for love and mercy.

716
00:36:49,276 --> 00:36:50,343
So...

717
00:36:50,978 --> 00:36:54,649
Is hell a state of being
or a... a physical place?

718
00:36:56,249 --> 00:36:57,518
Yes.

719
00:36:58,686 --> 00:37:00,320
I think I meant that
as an "either-or."

720
00:37:00,454 --> 00:37:01,689
It's both.

721
00:37:02,322 --> 00:37:03,390
Which is painfully obvious

722
00:37:03,524 --> 00:37:04,726
to anyone
who's ever been there.

723
00:37:05,126 --> 00:37:07,227
For years without measure,
that's all there ever was,

724
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:09,097
heaven and hell,
armed enemy camps

725
00:37:09,229 --> 00:37:10,297
in complete opposition.

726
00:37:10,430 --> 00:37:13,467
That is until
you were created.

727
00:37:15,169 --> 00:37:16,269
My master
immediately understood

728
00:37:16,403 --> 00:37:18,005
the long-term implications.

729
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:20,407
Instead of forgiving us,

730
00:37:20,541 --> 00:37:22,275
the enemy
was going to allow you

731
00:37:22,409 --> 00:37:24,746
to fill our vacant places
in His realm.

732
00:37:27,014 --> 00:37:29,884
Your creation was nothing
but a slap in our face.

733
00:37:32,285 --> 00:37:34,254
But my master also understood

734
00:37:34,856 --> 00:37:38,025
that if he could
make man disobey,

735
00:37:39,426 --> 00:37:41,929
then his fate
would mirror ours.

736
00:37:43,030 --> 00:37:44,599
And you didn't disappoint.

737
00:37:45,432 --> 00:37:47,434
Then came
the tares among the wheat.

738
00:37:47,568 --> 00:37:49,369
In that moment,
spirit became matter,

739
00:37:49,504 --> 00:37:50,671
flesh became a vessel,

740
00:37:50,805 --> 00:37:52,272
self-will
and self-seeking begat

741
00:37:52,405 --> 00:37:54,008
a lusting after sin
and impurity.

742
00:37:54,142 --> 00:37:55,543
And man,

743
00:37:55,676 --> 00:37:58,278
created to be king
over nature,

744
00:37:58,846 --> 00:38:00,313
became its slave.

745
00:38:01,381 --> 00:38:04,451
A master
conquered and fettered.

746
00:38:05,153 --> 00:38:10,525
And sin brought Him
and His descendants to us,

747
00:38:11,291 --> 00:38:13,528
and we began
our forever mission.

748
00:38:15,229 --> 00:38:16,831
To destroy you.

749
00:38:19,366 --> 00:38:21,501
He made you in His image.

750
00:38:23,171 --> 00:38:25,372
But we remade you in ours.

751
00:38:31,378 --> 00:38:32,613
So that's it?

752
00:38:33,714 --> 00:38:34,882
That's your entire plan.

753
00:38:35,016 --> 00:38:37,218
Not to make something
of your own,

754
00:38:37,350 --> 00:38:39,654
just to... just to destroy us?

755
00:38:39,787 --> 00:38:42,890
No. Our plan is to hurt Him.

756
00:38:43,024 --> 00:38:44,058
To punish Him.

757
00:38:44,525 --> 00:38:46,493
And we do that
by destroying what He loves,

758
00:38:46,627 --> 00:38:47,862
which is you.

759
00:38:49,530 --> 00:38:51,666
You're nothing
but a means to an end.

760
00:39:05,246 --> 00:39:06,781
What are you doing, James?

761
00:39:07,682 --> 00:39:08,883
I think we're done here.

762
00:39:09,217 --> 00:39:11,052
-We can't be.
-We are.

763
00:39:11,484 --> 00:39:13,688
You have
all the hallmarks of belief.

764
00:39:15,623 --> 00:39:17,091
I'm convinced
you actually believe

765
00:39:17,225 --> 00:39:18,458
what you're telling me.

766
00:39:19,861 --> 00:39:22,730
I didn't at first,
but, uh, I do now.

767
00:39:25,666 --> 00:39:26,968
You're gonna
declare me insane.

768
00:39:27,101 --> 00:39:28,836
I'm gonna concur
with Dr. Fischer's findings

769
00:39:28,970 --> 00:39:30,370
that you're
mentally incompetent

770
00:39:30,504 --> 00:39:32,073
-at this time.
-Can't do that, James.

771
00:39:32,206 --> 00:39:33,774
And likely at the time
the crimes were committed,

772
00:39:33,908 --> 00:39:35,710
rendering you
unfit for execution.

773
00:39:35,843 --> 00:39:38,112
-You can't do that.
-I can...

774
00:39:39,981 --> 00:39:41,015
and I will.

775
00:39:42,717 --> 00:39:44,085
I'm saying, James,

776
00:39:44,619 --> 00:39:46,020
you and I both know it.

777
00:39:46,153 --> 00:39:47,387
I'm not crazy.

778
00:39:47,521 --> 00:39:48,789
I'm sorry, Edward.

779
00:39:48,923 --> 00:39:50,191
You've been through
a terrible ordeal,

780
00:39:50,324 --> 00:39:51,859
and you're probably
longing for an escape

781
00:39:51,993 --> 00:39:53,160
from all that you've been
through, but I cannot

782
00:39:53,294 --> 00:39:54,896
morally say that you are sane.

783
00:39:56,197 --> 00:39:57,430
It would be murder.

784
00:39:59,066 --> 00:40:01,434
Why? Because
I don't have $3.6 million?

785
00:40:02,670 --> 00:40:03,838
Is that it, James?

786
00:40:04,071 --> 00:40:06,207
-We're done.
-Are we, James?

787
00:40:07,241 --> 00:40:08,843
I told you before
you'd leave here today,

788
00:40:08,976 --> 00:40:10,410
you would've
committed three murders.

789
00:40:10,544 --> 00:40:12,580
And I told you
that wasn't gonna happen.

790
00:40:12,713 --> 00:40:13,748
Hmm.

791
00:40:19,153 --> 00:40:21,722
Say, James,
what's Melanie up to today?

792
00:40:21,856 --> 00:40:23,724
As a matter of fact,

793
00:40:24,592 --> 00:40:25,993
what's she up to right now?

794
00:40:29,563 --> 00:40:31,232
She doesn't have a clue
you're about to break up

795
00:40:31,365 --> 00:40:32,499
with her, does she?

796
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,434
Of course you're
not gonna until you have

797
00:40:34,568 --> 00:40:35,636
somebody else
lined up though, right?

798
00:40:35,770 --> 00:40:37,038
Because you're
that kind of guy.

799
00:40:37,972 --> 00:40:39,407
But you already have
your sights on somebody,

800
00:40:39,540 --> 00:40:40,841
don't you?

801
00:40:40,975 --> 00:40:43,577
Yeah. I can smell it
all the way from here.

802
00:40:44,645 --> 00:40:47,181
She thinks she's doing this
to maintain the relationship.

803
00:40:48,582 --> 00:40:51,018
She'd like to have
a child with you, James.

804
00:40:51,152 --> 00:40:52,420
Oh,
but you're just not,

805
00:40:52,553 --> 00:40:54,355
not quite ready yet, are you?

806
00:40:54,487 --> 00:40:56,991
After all, you're only 35.

807
00:40:57,692 --> 00:40:59,160
Imagine the joy

808
00:40:59,293 --> 00:41:01,128
in your little Cinderella's
heart when she realizes

809
00:41:01,262 --> 00:41:04,165
she's butchered the baby
in her belly for nothing.

810
00:41:05,766 --> 00:41:08,602
Look, I don't know
what you think you know,

811
00:41:09,704 --> 00:41:11,038
but any decision
that was made between me

812
00:41:11,172 --> 00:41:13,040
and my girlfriend
was her choice.

813
00:41:13,174 --> 00:41:14,308
Well, I think
we both know better, James.

814
00:41:14,442 --> 00:41:15,643
Stop it.

815
00:41:15,776 --> 00:41:16,978
Don't you think
you should be there

816
00:41:17,111 --> 00:41:18,145
-when it's being done?
-I said, stop it.

817
00:41:18,279 --> 00:41:19,513
Hold her hand, maybe?

818
00:41:19,647 --> 00:41:21,048
I'll tell you what
you could do, James.

819
00:41:21,182 --> 00:41:22,750
You could walk right there
to the guard station,

820
00:41:22,883 --> 00:41:24,085
pick up that cell phone
and make a phone call

821
00:41:24,218 --> 00:41:25,286
that stops everything
in its tracks.

822
00:41:26,020 --> 00:41:27,421
You could apologize to her.

823
00:41:27,555 --> 00:41:28,756
Tell her you made
a horrible mistake,

824
00:41:28,889 --> 00:41:29,924
that you love her,
you wanna spend

825
00:41:30,057 --> 00:41:31,692
the rest
of your life with her,

826
00:41:31,826 --> 00:41:33,527
you wanna marry her,
and you wanna hold that child.

827
00:41:33,661 --> 00:41:35,229
James,
you could tell her that.

828
00:41:35,963 --> 00:41:38,566
You could make your life
about sacrificial love.

829
00:41:38,699 --> 00:41:39,900
And you could play
live-in therapist

830
00:41:40,034 --> 00:41:42,136
for the rest of your life.

831
00:41:43,004 --> 00:41:45,139
-I can't do that.
-No, James, why not?

832
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:48,609
It's... It's complicated.

833
00:41:50,811 --> 00:41:53,814
That's my boy, James!

834
00:41:54,415 --> 00:41:55,683
That's him right there.

835
00:41:55,816 --> 00:41:57,184
-You don't understand.
-Oh, I think I do,

836
00:41:57,318 --> 00:41:59,286
James. I think I understand.

837
00:42:00,121 --> 00:42:02,656
It's another problem
easily solved though,

838
00:42:02,790 --> 00:42:04,625
-isn't it?
-That's not it.

839
00:42:07,161 --> 00:42:08,562
Like, I care about it,
but I'm...

840
00:42:09,263 --> 00:42:11,699
-What?
-I'm not ready to be a father.

841
00:42:11,832 --> 00:42:13,200
Oh.

842
00:42:16,037 --> 00:42:19,540
It's her body.
She can do what she wants.

843
00:42:20,341 --> 00:42:21,642
"Do what thou wilt

844
00:42:22,276 --> 00:42:25,413
"that shall be
the whole of the Law."

845
00:42:25,546 --> 00:42:27,048
You arrogant son of a...

846
00:42:29,083 --> 00:42:31,118
Who... Who are you
to judge me?

847
00:42:32,186 --> 00:42:34,523
This is my life. I...
I can live it the way I want.

848
00:42:34,655 --> 00:42:36,223
Yes, James!

849
00:42:36,357 --> 00:42:38,692
I couldn't have
said it better myself.

850
00:42:41,796 --> 00:42:43,264
But it's still murder.

851
00:42:43,397 --> 00:42:44,465
Says who?

852
00:42:44,598 --> 00:42:47,168
Says all of creation, James.

853
00:42:47,902 --> 00:42:49,670
The creator creates,
and we destroy,

854
00:42:49,804 --> 00:42:52,106
and we do all of it
through you.

855
00:42:52,239 --> 00:42:53,274
We always have.

856
00:42:53,741 --> 00:42:55,476
Did you forget
your history, Jimmy?

857
00:42:56,110 --> 00:42:58,012
Even in ancient times,
the arch-demon Moloch

858
00:42:58,145 --> 00:42:59,847
was celebrated
by tossing infants

859
00:42:59,980 --> 00:43:01,749
into flaming bonfires,

860
00:43:01,882 --> 00:43:03,384
accompanied, of course,
by the beating of drums

861
00:43:03,518 --> 00:43:04,919
to drown out the screaming.

862
00:43:05,786 --> 00:43:09,156
Later on, they erected
a giant bronze statue

863
00:43:09,558 --> 00:43:10,758
with outstretched arms

864
00:43:10,891 --> 00:43:12,760
kindling fires
beneath the palms,

865
00:43:12,893 --> 00:43:14,628
and when they toss
a little infant

866
00:43:14,762 --> 00:43:15,963
into those open palms,

867
00:43:16,097 --> 00:43:17,765
they'd flinch
at the red-hot metal,

868
00:43:17,898 --> 00:43:19,100
but then they'd willingly

869
00:43:19,233 --> 00:43:21,001
roll themselves
off into the flames.

870
00:43:21,135 --> 00:43:22,670
What does any
of that have to do with me?

871
00:43:22,803 --> 00:43:24,738
Oh, nothing, James!

872
00:43:25,139 --> 00:43:27,274
Especially since the priests
now wear surgical scrubs.

873
00:43:27,408 --> 00:43:28,943
The killing takes place
in the womb.

874
00:43:29,076 --> 00:43:30,579
So there's no screaming
to be heard anyway,

875
00:43:30,711 --> 00:43:33,881
and the remains are tossed
into gas-fired crematoriums.

876
00:43:34,014 --> 00:43:35,950
No, James, no. No, no, no.

877
00:43:36,083 --> 00:43:39,220
There's no parallel
whatsoever to you.

878
00:43:40,387 --> 00:43:44,358
Can you imagine
the agony the carpenter feels

879
00:43:44,492 --> 00:43:46,760
when we rip a child to pieces

880
00:43:47,228 --> 00:43:49,997
inside its own mother's womb?

881
00:43:50,898 --> 00:43:54,768
Because that's what we do,
James, you and us.

882
00:43:56,337 --> 00:43:57,905
We do that together.

883
00:44:01,942 --> 00:44:04,345
- You're sick.
- Yeah.

884
00:44:06,113 --> 00:44:09,250
That might be the nicest thing
you've ever said to me, James.

885
00:44:13,487 --> 00:44:14,788
Can you feel it?

886
00:44:16,023 --> 00:44:17,391
Can you feel it, James?

887
00:44:18,826 --> 00:44:20,327
It's starting to happen.

888
00:44:21,395 --> 00:44:24,865
Your unborn son

889
00:44:25,466 --> 00:44:27,101
is now on our altar.

890
00:44:28,637 --> 00:44:29,870
Here he comes.

891
00:44:30,804 --> 00:44:36,177
In five, four, three...

892
00:44:37,278 --> 00:44:38,379
two...

893
00:44:38,846 --> 00:44:40,981
One!

894
00:44:41,815 --> 00:44:45,452
And all hell rejoices, James!

895
00:44:58,499 --> 00:45:00,201
And that's two, James.

896
00:45:04,639 --> 00:45:06,974
Open up!

897
00:45:08,577 --> 00:45:10,177
Open!

898
00:45:14,215 --> 00:45:16,917
<i>Hey, um,</i>
<i>where can I make a call?</i>

899
00:45:17,051 --> 00:45:19,253
Uh... I need
authorization for that.

900
00:45:19,386 --> 00:45:20,988
-It'll take time.
<i>-I... I... I don't have time.</i>

901
00:45:21,121 --> 00:45:23,724
<i>Can I borrow your cell?</i>

902
00:45:23,857 --> 00:45:25,092
We're not allowed
to carry them.

903
00:45:25,627 --> 00:45:27,629
<i>Look, I wouldn't be asking</i>
<i>if this wasn't an emergency.</i>

904
00:45:28,195 --> 00:45:30,197
This... This is me begging.

905
00:45:32,166 --> 00:45:34,134
All right, I can put you up
in the prisoners' call bank.

906
00:45:34,268 --> 00:45:35,936
-It's empty, but...
<i>-Okay.</i>

907
00:45:36,070 --> 00:45:37,471
- ...all calls are recorded.
<i>- That's fine.</i>

908
00:45:37,606 --> 00:45:38,673
<i>I... I don't care.</i>
<i>What... What this way?</i>

909
00:45:38,806 --> 00:45:40,040
-Yeah.
<i>-Okay.</i>

910
00:45:40,174 --> 00:45:41,576
<i>Hi, it's me.</i>

911
00:45:41,710 --> 00:45:43,377
<i>They just called my name</i>
<i>and I'm about to go in.</i>

912
00:45:43,511 --> 00:45:45,045
<i>I just... just wanted</i>
<i>to hear your voice...</i>

913
00:45:45,179 --> 00:45:47,147
<i>...but I guess you're busy.</i>

914
00:45:48,349 --> 00:45:49,383
<i>I love you.</i>

915
00:46:04,666 --> 00:46:06,166
<i>Women's Health Center.</i>

916
00:46:06,300 --> 00:46:07,801
<i>This is Renee,</i>
<i>how can I help you?</i>

917
00:46:08,302 --> 00:46:09,770
<i>The call</i>
<i>you're about to receive</i>

918
00:46:09,903 --> 00:46:11,138
<i>originates from an inmate</i>

919
00:46:11,272 --> 00:46:12,940
<i>at the Oklahoma</i>
<i>State Reformatory.</i>

920
00:46:13,073 --> 00:46:14,441
All right, no, no, no.

921
00:46:14,576 --> 00:46:15,943
That... That's not correct.
I'm at the prison,

922
00:46:16,076 --> 00:46:17,211
but I'm a doctor
caring for a prisoner.

923
00:46:17,344 --> 00:46:18,912
Can I speak to Melanie Carter?

924
00:46:19,046 --> 00:46:20,414
<i>Are you her physician?</i>

925
00:46:20,548 --> 00:46:21,750
No. I... I'm...

926
00:46:22,483 --> 00:46:24,485
I'm her friend.
Can I speak to her?

927
00:46:24,818 --> 00:46:27,021
<i>I'm sorry, but they</i>
<i>just took her into recovery.</i>

928
00:46:27,154 --> 00:46:29,123
<i>So, it's going</i>
<i>to be about an hour</i>

929
00:46:29,256 --> 00:46:31,325
<i>before she's ready</i>
<i>to speak with anyone.</i>

930
00:46:55,349 --> 00:46:57,117
Kitchen needs
your last meal order.

931
00:46:57,251 --> 00:46:59,253
But before you go
getting too creative,

932
00:46:59,386 --> 00:47:00,755
needs to be
available from the kitchen,

933
00:47:00,888 --> 00:47:02,122
or commissary.

934
00:47:02,256 --> 00:47:04,858
And it can't cost
more than $25 in total.

935
00:47:06,827 --> 00:47:09,698
Could I have

936
00:47:09,830 --> 00:47:12,567
a bacon double cheeseburger?

937
00:47:13,568 --> 00:47:16,337
Well-done.

938
00:47:17,371 --> 00:47:19,607
And fries.

939
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:26,280
And could I have
a chocolate shake?

940
00:47:28,583 --> 00:47:30,084
Extra thick.

941
00:47:30,984 --> 00:47:32,286
Please?

942
00:47:33,887 --> 00:47:38,459
And please, please,
don't mess it up.

943
00:47:38,727 --> 00:47:42,062
It's important to me.

944
00:47:42,664 --> 00:47:44,498
Please don't...

945
00:47:54,709 --> 00:47:56,043
Excuse me.

946
00:47:57,746 --> 00:47:58,979
I've changed my mind.

947
00:47:59,647 --> 00:48:01,549
I won't have anything.
I'm not hungry.

948
00:48:02,182 --> 00:48:03,651
Are you sure?

949
00:48:06,788 --> 00:48:09,323
Yes. I'm sure.

950
00:48:24,639 --> 00:48:26,140
Storm's coming in.

951
00:48:29,176 --> 00:48:30,944
I don't understand. He...

952
00:48:32,279 --> 00:48:34,915
He's been in solitary.
He hasn't made any phone calls

953
00:48:35,048 --> 00:48:36,150
or had any visitors...

954
00:48:36,283 --> 00:48:37,852
He got in your head,
didn't he?

955
00:48:38,586 --> 00:48:40,688
Look at you, man, you're...
you're shaking.

956
00:48:42,423 --> 00:48:43,457
Here.

957
00:48:44,958 --> 00:48:46,193
Here you go.

958
00:48:48,897 --> 00:48:52,700
I buy one pack of these
the day before an execution.

959
00:48:59,507 --> 00:49:00,575
The deal is...

960
00:49:01,643 --> 00:49:03,143
if there's any left
by the time I drive

961
00:49:03,277 --> 00:49:05,345
out of here tonight,
they go in the trash.

962
00:49:07,981 --> 00:49:09,216
Are there ever any left?

963
00:49:11,452 --> 00:49:12,486
Never.

964
00:49:15,322 --> 00:49:17,592
Look, doc,
it's almost four o'clock.

965
00:49:18,192 --> 00:49:19,326
I know you're doing
your job here,

966
00:49:19,460 --> 00:49:22,162
but you got to help me out.

967
00:49:23,497 --> 00:49:25,365
I got to know
one way or the other.

968
00:49:27,968 --> 00:49:29,671
You're not
making things easy on me.

969
00:49:30,605 --> 00:49:32,507
By the look of it,
you ain't doing happy things

970
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:33,675
to yourself either.

971
00:49:42,517 --> 00:49:45,620
Sixty more minutes.
That's all I can give you.

972
00:49:46,453 --> 00:49:48,188
You have one hour
to figure this out.

973
00:50:19,353 --> 00:50:20,655
I want to know
how you knew my girlfriend

974
00:50:20,788 --> 00:50:21,789
was having an abortion.

975
00:50:24,926 --> 00:50:27,461
I'm a demon, remember?

976
00:50:27,962 --> 00:50:29,196
How did you know?

977
00:50:31,098 --> 00:50:32,800
I chose you, James.

978
00:50:33,835 --> 00:50:35,603
And ever since
I've been watching you,

979
00:50:35,970 --> 00:50:37,271
analyzing you, observing you,

980
00:50:37,404 --> 00:50:38,973
studying you
for your weaknesses.

981
00:50:39,106 --> 00:50:40,440
From inside a prison cell?

982
00:50:40,575 --> 00:50:42,376
Demons can only be
one place in any one time,

983
00:50:42,510 --> 00:50:44,478
but we can be
any place we choose.

984
00:50:45,379 --> 00:50:46,581
Usually, I'm here with Edward.

985
00:50:46,714 --> 00:50:47,949
The remaining time
I'm with you.

986
00:50:48,081 --> 00:50:49,249
I don't believe you.

987
00:50:49,383 --> 00:50:51,886
Well, you explain
how I did it, James.

988
00:50:52,352 --> 00:50:53,988
-You explain how I know.
-I can't.

989
00:50:54,388 --> 00:50:56,056
And I can't explain
how a professional magician

990
00:50:56,189 --> 00:50:57,224
does his tricks either,

991
00:50:57,357 --> 00:50:58,826
but that doesn't
make them real.

992
00:50:59,192 --> 00:51:00,795
Well, then I have
a confession to make.

993
00:51:00,929 --> 00:51:02,931
I'm not a demon at all, James.

994
00:51:03,565 --> 00:51:05,432
I'm just a man who doesn't
want to be executed.

995
00:51:05,733 --> 00:51:07,569
I thought I could fool you
but you're too smart,

996
00:51:07,702 --> 00:51:08,736
so I give up.

997
00:51:09,871 --> 00:51:10,939
So you're sane?

998
00:51:11,338 --> 00:51:12,640
You've always been sane,

999
00:51:12,974 --> 00:51:14,976
and now it's my duty
to let your execution

1000
00:51:15,108 --> 00:51:16,476
-go forward? Giving you...
-Yes.

1001
00:51:16,611 --> 00:51:18,211
...exactly what you said
you wanted the whole time?

1002
00:51:18,345 --> 00:51:19,647
-Yes.
-It's a little convenient,

1003
00:51:19,781 --> 00:51:21,181
-don't you think?
-Well, I admit it might seem

1004
00:51:21,315 --> 00:51:22,850
-that way, but...
-All right.

1005
00:51:24,151 --> 00:51:25,553
Fine.

1006
00:51:27,087 --> 00:51:28,856
I'll sign off on it right now.

1007
00:51:29,389 --> 00:51:32,026
You just have to answer
one little question.

1008
00:51:32,159 --> 00:51:33,393
With pleasure, James.

1009
00:51:33,528 --> 00:51:35,964
Give me the real world,
non-supernatural,

1010
00:51:36,096 --> 00:51:39,099
completely reasonable
explanation for how you knew

1011
00:51:39,232 --> 00:51:41,268
my girlfriend was going in
for an elective termination

1012
00:51:41,401 --> 00:51:43,203
this afternoon.

1013
00:51:45,372 --> 00:51:47,140
An elective ter...

1014
00:51:47,609 --> 00:51:49,644
Well, I... I don't know, Jim.

1015
00:51:49,777 --> 00:51:52,080
Maybe
I'm just a good guesser.

1016
00:51:52,212 --> 00:51:53,615
I still don't believe you.

1017
00:51:53,748 --> 00:51:55,282
I play the flute
and you wouldn't dance,

1018
00:51:55,415 --> 00:51:57,518
I played the dirge,
and you wouldn't weep.

1019
00:51:58,519 --> 00:51:59,954
I told you I'm a demon,
and you don't believe me.

1020
00:52:00,088 --> 00:52:01,723
I tell you I'm not a demon,
and you don't believe me.

1021
00:52:01,856 --> 00:52:03,223
So why don't you tell me
the story you'd like to hear.

1022
00:52:03,357 --> 00:52:04,926
The one that's true.

1023
00:52:05,059 --> 00:52:06,426
No, I told you the true story,
and you don't want to hear it.

1024
00:52:10,464 --> 00:52:12,399
Do you think I'm evil, James?

1025
00:52:13,701 --> 00:52:16,236
Evil isn't
a clinical diagnosis.

1026
00:52:17,371 --> 00:52:19,206
Good and evil are
societal constructs,

1027
00:52:19,339 --> 00:52:21,743
effectively subjective
value statements.

1028
00:52:21,876 --> 00:52:25,580
Do you think
my victims thought I was evil?

1029
00:52:25,713 --> 00:52:28,650
Why is it so important
that I think you're evil?

1030
00:52:32,386 --> 00:52:35,690
<i>Legio nomen</i>
<i>mihi est, quia multi sumus.</i>

1031
00:52:38,593 --> 00:52:41,161
Sorry, my, um,
my Latin's a little rusty.

1032
00:52:44,231 --> 00:52:46,668
"My name is Legion,
for we are many."

1033
00:52:47,602 --> 00:52:48,603
See, James,
it's not just about you

1034
00:52:48,736 --> 00:52:50,538
or Edward, for that matter.

1035
00:52:50,972 --> 00:52:52,040
It's about everyone.

1036
00:52:52,540 --> 00:52:54,441
The entire human race.

1037
00:52:55,009 --> 00:52:57,712
All of us against all of you.

1038
00:52:59,279 --> 00:53:00,515
Hmm.

1039
00:53:01,348 --> 00:53:03,651
Well, you know,
if that's the case,

1040
00:53:04,652 --> 00:53:06,621
your side's
not doing too well.

1041
00:53:08,455 --> 00:53:10,424
Do you really
believe that, James?

1042
00:53:11,125 --> 00:53:12,359
Yeah.

1043
00:53:13,360 --> 00:53:15,129
We've never been freer.

1044
00:53:15,262 --> 00:53:17,197
Literacy is
at an all-time high.

1045
00:53:17,665 --> 00:53:19,366
We're working
to eliminate racism.

1046
00:53:19,499 --> 00:53:21,169
Intolerance.

1047
00:53:21,769 --> 00:53:23,470
Gender inequality.
People can...

1048
00:53:23,604 --> 00:53:25,073
People can love who they want.

1049
00:53:26,007 --> 00:53:27,809
Be who they want,
do what they want.

1050
00:53:27,942 --> 00:53:29,777
Diversity is
no longer a dream.

1051
00:53:29,911 --> 00:53:32,914
Hate speech is
no longer tolerated,

1052
00:53:33,047 --> 00:53:34,082
and politically,

1053
00:53:34,782 --> 00:53:36,784
we're reclaiming
the moral high ground.

1054
00:53:37,819 --> 00:53:38,853
James.

1055
00:53:39,687 --> 00:53:41,288
I think I love you.

1056
00:53:42,422 --> 00:53:43,691
Literacy, James.

1057
00:53:44,058 --> 00:53:45,593
James, the average
high school graduate reads

1058
00:53:45,727 --> 00:53:47,095
at a sixth-grade level.

1059
00:53:47,795 --> 00:53:49,964
You have basketball players
making $30 million a year

1060
00:53:50,098 --> 00:53:51,264
decrying racism.

1061
00:53:51,733 --> 00:53:54,569
All while wearing sneakers
made from slave labor.

1062
00:53:55,268 --> 00:53:56,336
Now, here's something for you.

1063
00:53:56,704 --> 00:53:57,839
Right now, your world

1064
00:53:57,972 --> 00:54:00,074
currently has
40 million slaves.

1065
00:54:00,208 --> 00:54:02,476
More than the Romans had
at the height of their empire.

1066
00:54:02,610 --> 00:54:03,845
And you want to know
the best part, though?

1067
00:54:05,046 --> 00:54:05,980
Half of those,

1068
00:54:06,114 --> 00:54:09,584
half are sex slaves, James.

1069
00:54:11,652 --> 00:54:13,588
As for hate speech, well,

1070
00:54:14,555 --> 00:54:16,023
you want to hear some irony?

1071
00:54:16,958 --> 00:54:18,526
We didn't even come up
with that one.

1072
00:54:19,259 --> 00:54:20,895
You did it all by yourself.

1073
00:54:23,798 --> 00:54:25,833
Sometimes you amaze even us.

1074
00:54:27,135 --> 00:54:28,401
I fail to see the humor.

1075
00:54:30,104 --> 00:54:33,107
Bottom line is you're done.
It's over. That's it.

1076
00:54:33,674 --> 00:54:36,077
And we did it
all right to your face, James.

1077
00:54:36,210 --> 00:54:38,513
And now
there's evil everywhere.

1078
00:54:39,147 --> 00:54:40,915
And no one even cares.

1079
00:54:42,617 --> 00:54:44,218
Yeah, I don't agree.

1080
00:54:44,351 --> 00:54:46,154
Proving that
we achieved our goal.

1081
00:54:46,821 --> 00:54:49,891
Slowly with your movies,
and your TV, and your media,

1082
00:54:50,591 --> 00:54:52,193
we desensitized you,

1083
00:54:52,325 --> 00:54:54,262
redirected your worldview

1084
00:54:54,394 --> 00:54:55,696
to the point that
you can't even recognize

1085
00:54:55,830 --> 00:54:57,565
even when it's right
in front of your face.

1086
00:54:57,698 --> 00:54:59,299
More to the point,
James, you can't even feel it

1087
00:54:59,432 --> 00:55:00,768
when you're doing it.

1088
00:55:01,434 --> 00:55:02,369
And as for winners
and losers...

1089
00:55:02,502 --> 00:55:03,771
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1090
00:55:03,905 --> 00:55:05,606
Like, it's decided
at the time of death.

1091
00:55:06,140 --> 00:55:08,776
The exact numbers are
a closely guarded secret,

1092
00:55:08,910 --> 00:55:13,247
but there are more of you
ending up in my master's house

1093
00:55:13,380 --> 00:55:14,615
than with the enemy.

1094
00:55:16,284 --> 00:55:17,919
A lot more, Jimmy.

1095
00:55:28,529 --> 00:55:30,798
They're testing out
the generator.

1096
00:55:31,966 --> 00:55:32,900
Why?

1097
00:55:33,034 --> 00:55:34,235
Because Old Sparky

1098
00:55:34,367 --> 00:55:36,871
doesn't exactly run
on batteries now, does she?

1099
00:55:43,644 --> 00:55:45,980
I thought all executions
were lethal injection.

1100
00:55:46,113 --> 00:55:47,548
Nine states
still offer the chair.

1101
00:55:47,682 --> 00:55:48,983
It's an option
for the condemned.

1102
00:55:49,617 --> 00:55:51,052
No one chooses it.

1103
00:55:51,185 --> 00:55:52,587
Except you.

1104
00:55:53,855 --> 00:55:54,922
Except me.

1105
00:55:56,224 --> 00:55:58,358
Why... Why... Why the chair?

1106
00:55:58,926 --> 00:56:00,962
I don't like needles, James.

1107
00:56:03,231 --> 00:56:04,265
Why do you think?

1108
00:56:05,032 --> 00:56:06,634
It's my parting gift
to Edward.

1109
00:56:07,335 --> 00:56:09,904
A tidal wave of voltage
coursing through his body,

1110
00:56:10,037 --> 00:56:11,371
so extreme that
his body will attempt

1111
00:56:11,505 --> 00:56:12,840
to arc out of the chair.

1112
00:56:13,373 --> 00:56:14,441
He'll urinate, defecate,

1113
00:56:14,575 --> 00:56:15,910
and vomit
all at the same time.

1114
00:56:16,043 --> 00:56:19,547
Sickly, sweet smell
of burning flesh

1115
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:21,182
will permeate the chamber.

1116
00:56:21,816 --> 00:56:23,150
His eyeballs will melt
when the blood

1117
00:56:23,284 --> 00:56:25,485
inside his cranium
reaches the boiling point.

1118
00:56:25,620 --> 00:56:27,221
And his head will just
burst into flames,

1119
00:56:27,355 --> 00:56:28,756
and the best part
about it, James,

1120
00:56:28,890 --> 00:56:30,457
is he won't die
on the first try.

1121
00:56:30,858 --> 00:56:33,493
So hit him again, and again.

1122
00:56:34,929 --> 00:56:36,964
I can't think
of a more fitting introduction

1123
00:56:37,098 --> 00:56:38,431
into damnation.

1124
00:56:39,667 --> 00:56:42,770
It's so horrible.
It's wonderful, James.

1125
00:56:43,738 --> 00:56:45,273
Only crucifixion is worse,

1126
00:56:45,405 --> 00:56:47,909
but that really wasn't
on the menu though, was it?

1127
00:56:53,114 --> 00:56:54,148
Edward.

1128
00:56:55,349 --> 00:56:56,984
Edward, listen to me.

1129
00:56:57,818 --> 00:56:59,220
You're making a mistake.

1130
00:56:59,620 --> 00:57:01,856
Okay, you're playing
a game that if you lose,

1131
00:57:02,290 --> 00:57:04,959
everything you just described
is going to happen.

1132
00:57:05,092 --> 00:57:07,028
No! No!

1133
00:57:08,262 --> 00:57:09,496
I didn't...

1134
00:57:11,832 --> 00:57:15,169
I didn't do anything!

1135
00:57:16,170 --> 00:57:19,173
Please! Please!

1136
00:57:19,874 --> 00:57:21,342
Help me!

1137
00:57:21,474 --> 00:57:22,677
Look, I'm trying to, Edward,

1138
00:57:22,810 --> 00:57:24,178
but you have
to answer my questions.

1139
00:57:24,312 --> 00:57:25,746
You have to tell me the truth.

1140
00:57:25,880 --> 00:57:30,685
They... won't let me enter!

1141
00:57:30,818 --> 00:57:32,653
Make him. Make him go away.

1142
00:57:32,787 --> 00:57:35,289
He doesn't want to go away!

1143
00:57:35,423 --> 00:57:36,891
Well, how can I make him
go away?

1144
00:57:37,024 --> 00:57:39,627
Is there anything I can do
to make him go away?

1145
00:57:40,828 --> 00:57:43,164
-Yeah.
-Yes?

1146
00:57:45,733 --> 00:57:47,168
Yeah.

1147
00:57:48,468 --> 00:57:49,737
Yeah.

1148
00:57:50,571 --> 00:57:52,006
Yeah.

1149
00:57:54,442 --> 00:57:55,676
Yeah.

1150
00:57:56,377 --> 00:57:59,914
But you have to...

1151
00:58:01,949 --> 00:58:02,984
get...

1152
00:58:03,784 --> 00:58:06,954
Very good, James.

1153
00:58:09,423 --> 00:58:10,524
Unfortunately for Edward,

1154
00:58:10,658 --> 00:58:12,660
he has broken
one of our rules.

1155
00:58:14,428 --> 00:58:16,097
What... what are you doing?

1156
00:58:17,298 --> 00:58:19,400
I wouldn't do that
if I was you.

1157
00:58:20,034 --> 00:58:21,702
They'll send me
to the infirmary.

1158
00:58:21,836 --> 00:58:23,871
Our session will be over.
Is that what you want, James?

1159
00:58:24,005 --> 00:58:27,675
I... I want you
to stop hurting yourself.

1160
00:58:27,808 --> 00:58:29,543
Okay, okay.

1161
00:58:30,277 --> 00:58:31,979
Watch this, James.

1162
00:58:47,595 --> 00:58:48,829
All better.

1163
00:59:15,122 --> 00:59:17,024
I see that you're,
you're sweating profusely.

1164
00:59:17,158 --> 00:59:19,794
Are you, um...

1165
00:59:19,927 --> 00:59:21,729
Are you trying
to hold back the pain?

1166
00:59:21,862 --> 00:59:23,597
I think you're misinterpreting

1167
00:59:23,731 --> 00:59:26,133
the involuntary reaction
of Edward's body.

1168
00:59:27,435 --> 00:59:28,736
Like him, I feel the pain.

1169
00:59:29,603 --> 00:59:30,871
But unlike him,

1170
00:59:31,405 --> 00:59:32,873
I enjoy it.

1171
00:59:36,744 --> 00:59:38,079
I think it's time

1172
00:59:38,913 --> 00:59:42,616
we tell you exactly what it is
that we'd like you to do.

1173
00:59:43,818 --> 00:59:45,986
You want me
to write your book, right?

1174
00:59:46,120 --> 00:59:48,422
Actually, James,
you've already written it.

1175
00:59:48,557 --> 00:59:50,091
You're not making any sense.

1176
00:59:50,858 --> 00:59:53,194
Everything will become
clear soon.

1177
00:59:55,696 --> 00:59:57,898
We just need you
to agree to help us.

1178
00:59:58,032 --> 00:59:59,834
Why would I do that?
What... What...

1179
01:00:00,701 --> 01:00:02,002
What's in it for me?

1180
01:00:02,703 --> 01:00:05,039
Whatever's my master's
is mine to give.

1181
01:00:05,574 --> 01:00:07,141
For those who serve us.

1182
01:00:09,210 --> 01:00:11,745
Okay, so, um,
let me get this straight.

1183
01:00:13,481 --> 01:00:15,416
An unknown psychiatrist

1184
01:00:15,550 --> 01:00:17,451
with, uh, no agents,

1185
01:00:17,586 --> 01:00:19,220
no connections, no publicity,

1186
01:00:19,353 --> 01:00:21,155
is going to somehow
put out a book

1187
01:00:21,288 --> 01:00:23,324
that... that
he doesn't remember writing,

1188
01:00:24,091 --> 01:00:27,094
that will change
the world as we know it?

1189
01:00:27,228 --> 01:00:31,600
This book will be
a worldwide phenomenon, James.

1190
01:00:31,732 --> 01:00:33,033
-Why?
-Because you'll be

1191
01:00:33,167 --> 01:00:34,902
telling people what they
already want to hear.

1192
01:00:35,469 --> 01:00:38,639
Because my death,
my execution will do for me

1193
01:00:38,772 --> 01:00:39,907
what the carpenter's death

1194
01:00:40,040 --> 01:00:41,576
and His resurrection
did for Him.

1195
01:00:42,376 --> 01:00:44,278
At my death,
you will be my witness,

1196
01:00:44,411 --> 01:00:47,114
and upon my return
you will be my apostle.

1197
01:00:47,582 --> 01:00:50,284
And your testimony will do
for our movement what that

1198
01:00:50,417 --> 01:00:53,154
wretched book did for His.

1199
01:00:53,287 --> 01:00:54,155
What kind of book

1200
01:00:54,288 --> 01:00:55,923
could possibly
have that effect?

1201
01:00:56,056 --> 01:00:58,659
The dark gospel, James.

1202
01:00:59,727 --> 01:01:01,962
Our story, our truth,

1203
01:01:02,296 --> 01:01:04,498
our <i>crie de couer</i> to mankind.

1204
01:01:05,032 --> 01:01:06,300
Our invitation to reject

1205
01:01:06,433 --> 01:01:08,869
the Mosaic Covenant
once and for all.

1206
01:01:09,270 --> 01:01:11,172
To throw
the chains off forever.

1207
01:01:11,506 --> 01:01:13,340
To reject the idea
of sin completely

1208
01:01:13,474 --> 01:01:16,677
so you're free
to reach your full potential.

1209
01:01:17,344 --> 01:01:19,079
And your enemy
would allow that?

1210
01:01:19,213 --> 01:01:20,247
Yes.

1211
01:01:20,881 --> 01:01:22,283
Because He has to.

1212
01:01:23,050 --> 01:01:24,218
He gave man free will

1213
01:01:24,351 --> 01:01:26,987
because He wanted
His creation's love.

1214
01:01:27,821 --> 01:01:29,023
But if man isn't free,

1215
01:01:29,156 --> 01:01:30,925
then the love has
no value, does it?

1216
01:01:31,859 --> 01:01:34,828
So, in His needy,
selfish, pathetic way,

1217
01:01:34,962 --> 01:01:37,031
well, He doomed Himself
from the start.

1218
01:01:37,164 --> 01:01:41,135
But if He's God,
shouldn't He have known that?

1219
01:01:41,268 --> 01:01:42,303
Yes.

1220
01:01:42,970 --> 01:01:44,673
That's why He had to cheat.

1221
01:01:45,607 --> 01:01:47,908
My master designed
every tool imaginable

1222
01:01:48,042 --> 01:01:50,744
to destroy every facet
of the enemy's creation.

1223
01:01:52,713 --> 01:01:55,449
We failed
because of the carpenter.

1224
01:01:56,217 --> 01:01:58,185
He was the thorn in our side.

1225
01:01:58,953 --> 01:02:01,021
Our greatest threat.

1226
01:02:02,223 --> 01:02:03,558
We thought
if we could eliminate Him

1227
01:02:03,692 --> 01:02:05,826
the world will be
ours forever.

1228
01:02:07,228 --> 01:02:09,830
We had no idea
of the consequences.

1229
01:02:11,432 --> 01:02:15,236
The cross was
our greatest mistake,

1230
01:02:16,671 --> 01:02:18,540
and we thought
we'd lost, James.

1231
01:02:19,240 --> 01:02:21,842
Until my master realized
that man still wants

1232
01:02:21,976 --> 01:02:23,712
to be his own God,

1233
01:02:23,844 --> 01:02:26,180
and to serve
no one but himself.

1234
01:02:27,114 --> 01:02:28,782
Whereas the carpenter demands

1235
01:02:28,916 --> 01:02:32,319
as the price
for His suffering routine,

1236
01:02:33,087 --> 01:02:34,623
well, that you fall
on your knees,

1237
01:02:34,755 --> 01:02:36,223
and you worship Him.

1238
01:02:37,458 --> 01:02:39,994
Just like His father?

1239
01:02:40,427 --> 01:02:41,462
Yeah.

1240
01:02:42,496 --> 01:02:43,598
But the dark gospel

1241
01:02:43,732 --> 01:02:45,667
will rectify
our past mistakes.

1242
01:02:46,200 --> 01:02:48,202
-By...
-By eliminating the enemy,

1243
01:02:48,469 --> 01:02:50,672
deifying man,
and elevating my master

1244
01:02:50,804 --> 01:02:52,373
to his rightful place.

1245
01:02:53,742 --> 01:02:54,942
And, James,

1246
01:02:55,644 --> 01:02:57,311
for serving as our messenger,

1247
01:02:58,279 --> 01:03:00,481
my master offers you the world

1248
01:03:00,615 --> 01:03:02,149
and everything in it.

1249
01:03:03,284 --> 01:03:05,520
Just like he offered
the carpenter.

1250
01:03:06,920 --> 01:03:09,390
But the carpenter said no.

1251
01:03:10,024 --> 01:03:11,760
But the carpenter
never claimed those things

1252
01:03:11,925 --> 01:03:13,794
weren't my master's to give.

1253
01:03:14,962 --> 01:03:16,864
He just turned down the offer.

1254
01:03:17,965 --> 01:03:19,833
And make no mistake, James.

1255
01:03:20,834 --> 01:03:22,303
You're no carpenter.

1256
01:03:32,313 --> 01:03:34,081
The warden wants to see you.

1257
01:03:35,215 --> 01:03:37,818
I'm... I'm not finished yet.

1258
01:03:37,951 --> 01:03:39,853
It's not a suggestion.

1259
01:03:59,006 --> 01:04:00,307
<i>I need you</i>
<i>to see something.</i>

1260
01:04:12,654 --> 01:04:15,422
We just found that during
the clear out of this cell.

1261
01:04:24,365 --> 01:04:26,367
Looks to me
like you got a fan.

1262
01:04:27,101 --> 01:04:28,402
How could he have done this?

1263
01:04:30,772 --> 01:04:33,173
There's stuff in here
even I don't know about me.

1264
01:04:33,608 --> 01:04:35,976
Did the same thing
with all his victims.

1265
01:04:38,112 --> 01:04:39,346
There's one more thing.

1266
01:04:48,889 --> 01:04:51,258
So you're telling me you had
nothing to do with this?

1267
01:04:51,659 --> 01:04:55,028
No. Of course not.
How... How could I...

1268
01:04:57,297 --> 01:04:59,701
He kept talking to me
about writing his book.

1269
01:05:00,367 --> 01:05:02,903
I said I wasn't a writer,
and he said not to worry.

1270
01:05:03,805 --> 01:05:05,272
It had already been written.

1271
01:05:07,908 --> 01:05:09,943
I thought it was
a bunch of nonsense.

1272
01:05:11,912 --> 01:05:14,616
Yeah, well, don't worry, doc.
It all ends when he does.

1273
01:05:16,651 --> 01:05:18,820
Personally,
I'm glad this happened.

1274
01:05:18,952 --> 01:05:20,655
Now you got skin in the game.

1275
01:05:23,023 --> 01:05:24,425
What do you mean?

1276
01:05:24,559 --> 01:05:27,094
Well, if you decide our boy
isn't fit for execution,

1277
01:05:27,227 --> 01:05:28,863
he's no longer
a condemned man.

1278
01:05:29,564 --> 01:05:31,932
I mean, sure, he'll spend some
time in psych lockdown,

1279
01:05:32,065 --> 01:05:34,134
but eventually
he'll make his way back

1280
01:05:34,268 --> 01:05:36,604
into the general
prison population.

1281
01:05:37,070 --> 01:05:39,973
Where he'll spend
every moment of every day

1282
01:05:40,107 --> 01:05:42,142
thinking about you.

1283
01:05:43,678 --> 01:05:45,145
And some night...

1284
01:05:46,113 --> 01:05:48,048
he's gonna be standing
at the foot of your bed,

1285
01:05:48,182 --> 01:05:49,584
looking down at you.

1286
01:05:50,552 --> 01:05:54,421
And my guess is,
it won't end well.

1287
01:06:00,394 --> 01:06:02,262
I need to ask him
one more question.

1288
01:06:03,631 --> 01:06:06,099
And after that,
your decision?

1289
01:06:06,768 --> 01:06:07,902
Yeah.

1290
01:06:08,035 --> 01:06:09,336
After that,

1291
01:06:10,471 --> 01:06:12,105
you'll have my final decision.

1292
01:06:27,421 --> 01:06:28,723
What the hell is this?

1293
01:06:32,560 --> 01:06:35,897
It's not nice to go through
other people's things, Jimmy.

1294
01:06:36,029 --> 01:06:38,332
You're a liar.
You've been studying me,

1295
01:06:38,465 --> 01:06:41,168
learning everything about me,
my relationships, my life.

1296
01:06:41,301 --> 01:06:42,737
How long has this
been going on?

1297
01:06:44,371 --> 01:06:46,574
-Since you were a child.
-Imp...

1298
01:06:46,708 --> 01:06:48,008
Impossible.

1299
01:06:49,677 --> 01:06:52,747
This is my first
photo of you, Jimmy.

1300
01:06:56,250 --> 01:06:58,285
I love it when we
have these moments.

1301
01:07:01,221 --> 01:07:02,389
You're insane.

1302
01:07:02,524 --> 01:07:04,391
That's the one thing
he can't be, doc.

1303
01:07:04,526 --> 01:07:05,560
Not today.

1304
01:07:09,597 --> 01:07:13,801
Is that your official
diagnosis, doctor?

1305
01:07:19,974 --> 01:07:21,576
I need to know.

1306
01:07:22,442 --> 01:07:24,311
Were you planning
on killing me?

1307
01:07:24,946 --> 01:07:26,014
Huh?

1308
01:07:26,313 --> 01:07:28,282
Was I supposed
to be your next victim?

1309
01:07:28,415 --> 01:07:30,585
Why would I do that, James?

1310
01:07:32,486 --> 01:07:34,154
You're my best friend.

1311
01:07:34,923 --> 01:07:36,323
You think that scares me?

1312
01:07:37,992 --> 01:07:40,828
-You get off on this?
-No.

1313
01:07:42,697 --> 01:07:44,131
I get off on this.

1314
01:07:47,769 --> 01:07:49,236
Back up! Back up!

1315
01:07:49,369 --> 01:07:50,470
I'll kill him.

1316
01:07:50,805 --> 01:07:53,575
Edward, easy. Let him go.
Nobody's gonna hurt you.

1317
01:07:53,708 --> 01:07:56,744
Thank you for that, Warden.
That is so comforting.

1318
01:07:57,545 --> 01:07:59,714
I got a question
for you, Jimmy.

1319
01:08:00,582 --> 01:08:03,585
What are you thinking
right now?

1320
01:08:04,986 --> 01:08:06,286
Answer me!

1321
01:08:08,322 --> 01:08:12,760
I'm thinking
that I'm gonna die.

1322
01:08:12,894 --> 01:08:16,330
It never gets old.
Strangulation.

1323
01:08:16,864 --> 01:08:19,499
You know, it's our favorite
method of work.

1324
01:08:19,634 --> 01:08:21,301
Do you realize that?

1325
01:08:21,435 --> 01:08:25,405
The intimate relationship
between killer and victim.

1326
01:08:26,440 --> 01:08:29,744
I can feel every ripple
coursing through your body.

1327
01:08:29,877 --> 01:08:33,146
I can feel your heart
throbbing through this chain.

1328
01:08:33,280 --> 01:08:34,916
You want to know
the best part, Jimmy?

1329
01:08:35,049 --> 01:08:37,986
The best part,
when I look in your eyes...

1330
01:08:38,118 --> 01:08:41,488
I can see the exact instant,

1331
01:08:41,623 --> 01:08:47,427
the tremulous moment
when the soul leaves the body!

1332
01:08:49,496 --> 01:08:50,732
Cry for me, Jimmy.

1333
01:08:50,865 --> 01:08:52,499
You beg for your life.

1334
01:08:52,634 --> 01:08:54,836
Beg me, Jimmy!

1335
01:08:57,237 --> 01:08:58,472
Edward...

1336
01:09:01,274 --> 01:09:04,112
I don't want to die.

1337
01:09:05,813 --> 01:09:06,848
Why?

1338
01:09:07,715 --> 01:09:09,717
Why would I kill you, James?

1339
01:09:10,518 --> 01:09:12,252
I feel like this brought us

1340
01:09:12,386 --> 01:09:15,757
so much closer together,
don't you?

1341
01:09:19,060 --> 01:09:20,528
Don't you just think?

1342
01:09:35,877 --> 01:09:38,345
- Okay, that's enough!
- No!

1343
01:09:39,013 --> 01:09:40,247
Get up.

1344
01:09:41,683 --> 01:09:44,952
Edward is crazy, James!
You know that!

1345
01:09:45,086 --> 01:09:48,321
You know that what you're
about to do is wrong.

1346
01:09:48,455 --> 01:09:50,457
It's wrong.
It's murder, James!

1347
01:09:51,458 --> 01:09:52,760
After all, James,

1348
01:09:52,894 --> 01:09:54,696
I'm just a figment of
his imagination.

1349
01:09:54,829 --> 01:09:57,397
Isn't that right?
Isn't that right, Jimmy?

1350
01:10:04,404 --> 01:10:07,909
I find the accused
Edward Wayne Brady

1351
01:10:08,676 --> 01:10:10,845
competent to stand execution.

1352
01:10:15,883 --> 01:10:18,218
And that's three, James.

1353
01:10:20,955 --> 01:10:22,156
Just like I said.

1354
01:10:22,890 --> 01:10:24,592
All right,
get him out of here.

1355
01:10:31,599 --> 01:10:33,201
I want you there, James.

1356
01:10:33,901 --> 01:10:36,637
I want you to see
what you've done!

1357
01:10:39,306 --> 01:10:41,743
I want you there, James!

1358
01:10:58,626 --> 01:10:59,861
You gonna stay?

1359
01:11:02,262 --> 01:11:03,497
You sure?

1360
01:11:05,298 --> 01:11:07,201
I need to see this to its end.

1361
01:11:07,334 --> 01:11:09,302
Well, you do what you want,

1362
01:11:09,436 --> 01:11:11,139
but I recommend
you just go home.

1363
01:11:11,271 --> 01:11:12,774
We can take it from here.

1364
01:11:13,741 --> 01:11:15,877
I need to know
if I made the right decision.

1365
01:11:20,982 --> 01:11:23,283
When a man sits in a cell
23 hours a day

1366
01:11:23,416 --> 01:11:25,285
with nothing to do
but reflect back

1367
01:11:25,418 --> 01:11:26,888
on all the evil
that he's done,

1368
01:11:28,256 --> 01:11:30,323
sometimes the man you execute

1369
01:11:30,457 --> 01:11:32,660
isn't the same man
who came in here.

1370
01:11:32,794 --> 01:11:35,663
And you feel bad about that.

1371
01:11:37,965 --> 01:11:40,067
But this is not
one of those times.

1372
01:11:53,748 --> 01:11:56,651
-What happens now?
-I do my job.

1373
01:11:58,052 --> 01:11:59,153
I meant...

1374
01:11:59,287 --> 01:12:01,522
Oh, he gets a haircut.

1375
01:12:02,290 --> 01:12:03,423
We take him to the barbershop

1376
01:12:03,558 --> 01:12:05,760
and shave his head
and his calf.

1377
01:12:06,661 --> 01:12:09,130
-Why?
-Connectivity.

1378
01:12:09,831 --> 01:12:11,632
That's where
the contact points will go

1379
01:12:11,766 --> 01:12:13,701
and human hair is a resistor,

1380
01:12:13,835 --> 01:12:16,737
and we need to provide
a clean clear connection.

1381
01:12:24,979 --> 01:12:26,881
You're gonna need these
more than me.

1382
01:12:47,969 --> 01:12:51,371
Just a little off the top.
And let's trim the sides.

1383
01:12:51,505 --> 01:12:54,575
I got a big evening planned.

1384
01:12:54,709 --> 01:12:56,544
Yeah, that's what I hear.

1385
01:12:58,411 --> 01:13:00,615
There's only one kind of cut
you're getting today.

1386
01:13:01,782 --> 01:13:04,552
Zero gap. All the way around.

1387
01:13:13,094 --> 01:13:17,098
You know, ain't nothing
you done can't be forgiven.

1388
01:13:19,800 --> 01:13:21,401
That's what you think.

1389
01:13:22,737 --> 01:13:25,172
"Each new morn,
new widows howl.

1390
01:13:25,306 --> 01:13:29,810
"New infants cry, new insults
slap the face of Heaven."

1391
01:13:31,411 --> 01:13:33,047
You trying to impress Styles?

1392
01:13:34,181 --> 01:13:37,518
Well, that ain't you, bruh.
That's Shakespeare.

1393
01:13:38,219 --> 01:13:39,587
Well, the words were his.

1394
01:13:41,589 --> 01:13:43,624
But the deeds were mine.

1395
01:13:46,661 --> 01:13:48,562
Well, even if it's so,

1396
01:13:49,697 --> 01:13:50,598
ain't nothing to be proud of.

1397
01:14:21,062 --> 01:14:22,563
All right, he's done.

1398
01:14:23,130 --> 01:14:25,666
-Get him outta here.
-Take it easy, buddy.

1399
01:14:27,001 --> 01:14:28,169
What's the rush?

1400
01:14:32,606 --> 01:14:34,008
Ain't nobody gonna miss you.

1401
01:14:39,914 --> 01:14:43,751
It'll be okay. It'll be okay.

1402
01:14:49,557 --> 01:14:50,891
It's going to be okay.

1403
01:14:57,631 --> 01:14:58,933
What...

1404
01:15:02,636 --> 01:15:06,107
What about my meal?

1405
01:15:09,910 --> 01:15:13,881
What about my meal?

1406
01:15:16,517 --> 01:15:19,253
You didn't want one. Remember?

1407
01:15:20,721 --> 01:15:21,956
What?

1408
01:15:22,556 --> 01:15:25,292
No, I didn't.
I didn't say that!

1409
01:15:26,627 --> 01:15:28,529
I didn't say that!

1410
01:15:28,662 --> 01:15:30,064
I want it!

1411
01:15:30,197 --> 01:15:31,232
I didn't say that!

1412
01:15:31,365 --> 01:15:33,667
I didn't...

1413
01:15:47,681 --> 01:15:49,150
Your attention, please.

1414
01:15:49,283 --> 01:15:52,053
All witnesses are reminded
that during an execution,

1415
01:15:52,186 --> 01:15:54,688
there must be
no emotional outbursts,

1416
01:15:54,822 --> 01:15:56,557
no obscenities uttered,

1417
01:15:56,690 --> 01:15:59,627
no taunting or celebration
of any kind.

1418
01:15:59,760 --> 01:16:01,929
You are hereby ordered
to display dignity

1419
01:16:02,063 --> 01:16:04,665
befitting the solemnity
of the occasion.

1420
01:16:04,799 --> 01:16:07,001
If you feel lightheaded
or about to be sick,

1421
01:16:07,134 --> 01:16:09,970
close your eyes and bow
your head towards your knees.

1422
01:16:10,104 --> 01:16:12,840
Once I secure this door,
it cannot and will not

1423
01:16:12,973 --> 01:16:15,376
be opened until
the procedure is complete.

1424
01:16:15,510 --> 01:16:18,379
So, if anyone has
any last-minute reservations

1425
01:16:18,513 --> 01:16:20,014
about what you're
about to witness,

1426
01:16:20,147 --> 01:16:22,683
now would be
the time to depart.

1427
01:16:27,455 --> 01:16:29,957
Edward Wayne Brady,
I have here your death warrant

1428
01:16:30,091 --> 01:16:32,093
which state law
compels me to read.

1429
01:16:32,226 --> 01:16:34,295
No! Can we just...

1430
01:16:34,428 --> 01:16:36,831
Can we just wait?

1431
01:16:38,833 --> 01:16:42,169
"On November 2nd of this year,
the Supreme Court of Oklahoma

1432
01:16:42,303 --> 01:16:46,006
"issued a stay of execution
for Edward Wayne Brady

1433
01:16:46,140 --> 01:16:47,542

"the mental competency

"Such review having taken
place and such competency

01:16:53,147 --> 01:16:54,882

"the stay is hereby lifted.

"of when and how
you have executed this writ."

1448
01:17:23,512 --> 01:17:25,446
And it's signed
by Governor Jennings.

1449
01:17:26,113 --> 01:17:28,315
Does the condemned
wish to review the warrant?

1450
01:17:35,456 --> 01:17:38,225
No. I trust you.

1451
01:17:56,744 --> 01:17:58,279
I wanted to thank you, doc.

1452
01:18:00,515 --> 01:18:02,216
I'm Detective John Russo.

1453
01:18:03,384 --> 01:18:06,787
I spent six miserable
years of my life

1454
01:18:07,488 --> 01:18:09,023
chasing this bastard.

1455
01:18:09,990 --> 01:18:13,928
Tonight at 11:00.
Waiting for this exact moment.

1456
01:18:14,962 --> 01:18:16,397
After tonight...

1457
01:18:19,466 --> 01:18:21,936
I can go back to worrying
about other things.

1458
01:18:25,674 --> 01:18:27,174
Stand-to, 30 seconds.

1459
01:18:27,308 --> 01:18:28,342
Open cell one.

1460
01:18:33,582 --> 01:18:34,583
Edward Wayne Brady,

1461
01:18:34,715 --> 01:18:36,317
stand to receive
your restraints.

1462
01:18:40,321 --> 01:18:41,789
You've been extended
the privilege of

1463
01:18:41,922 --> 01:18:43,791
walking under your own power.

1464
01:18:43,924 --> 01:18:45,392
Should you refuse,
you'll be carried.

1465
01:18:45,527 --> 01:18:47,696
Should you resist,
you'll be sprayed.

1466
01:18:47,828 --> 01:18:49,997
Am I made clear?

1467
01:18:54,401 --> 01:18:55,436
It's time.

1468
01:18:58,472 --> 01:18:59,507
We're moving.

1469
01:19:24,832 --> 01:19:26,800
No, no.

1470
01:19:26,934 --> 01:19:29,103
Can we just... Please, please!

1471
01:19:30,104 --> 01:19:33,708
Just...

1472
01:19:33,841 --> 01:19:35,409
Can we...

1473
01:19:48,757 --> 01:19:49,890
No, no!

1474
01:19:50,024 --> 01:19:52,059
Please! No!

1475
01:20:03,170 --> 01:20:06,574
Why are you doing this to me?

1476
01:20:06,708 --> 01:20:08,576
You tell them the truth!

1477
01:20:08,909 --> 01:20:11,011
Tell them the truth!

1478
01:20:11,145 --> 01:20:14,014
You tell them that
I didn't do this!

1479
01:20:14,148 --> 01:20:15,949
I didn't do this! I didn't!

1480
01:20:16,083 --> 01:20:18,018
Please! Help me!

1481
01:20:22,423 --> 01:20:24,925
Yes, sir, Mr. Governor.
I understand.

1482
01:20:26,528 --> 01:20:29,196
There will be no reprieve.
Make ready.

1483
01:20:59,627 --> 01:21:01,095
Edward Wayne Brady.

1484
01:21:01,228 --> 01:21:02,831
Before sentence is
carried out,

1485
01:21:02,963 --> 01:21:04,431
do you have any final words?

1486
01:21:13,073 --> 01:21:14,441
What's your answer, James?

1487
01:21:17,478 --> 01:21:19,647
Do you accept
my master's offer?

1488
01:21:24,952 --> 01:21:28,255
<i>Mene, mene, tekel, upharshin.</i>

1489
01:21:42,871 --> 01:21:44,371
What the hell
is he talking about?

1490
01:21:44,506 --> 01:21:45,673
Damned if I know.

1491
01:21:46,641 --> 01:21:48,976
Bring the generator
to full load.

1492
01:22:14,935 --> 01:22:15,969
Hit him.

1493
01:22:55,476 --> 01:22:56,845
I can still make out activity.

1494
01:22:56,977 --> 01:22:58,312
All right. Stand clear.

1495
01:23:01,716 --> 01:23:02,750
Hit him again.

1496
01:23:39,621 --> 01:23:40,655
This man is dead.

1497
01:23:41,956 --> 01:23:43,223
Cut the generator.

1498
01:23:44,391 --> 01:23:48,663
Log time of death
at 11:02 p.m.

1499
01:23:49,429 --> 01:23:52,165
Remand the body for autopsy.
Commence debrief.

1500
01:23:52,299 --> 01:23:54,268
Witnesses are hereby released.

1501
01:23:54,401 --> 01:23:57,271
Other posts return
to standard operation.

1502
01:24:04,411 --> 01:24:05,914
Looks like every
dirtbag on the planet

1503
01:24:06,046 --> 01:24:07,615
just moved up a notch.

1504
01:24:16,925 --> 01:24:18,125
You okay?

1505
01:24:20,728 --> 01:24:24,264
<i>You should</i>
<i>have accepted my offer, James.</i>

1506
01:24:30,638 --> 01:24:31,673
No.

1507
01:24:32,205 --> 01:24:33,473
No, no, no.

1508
01:24:33,608 --> 01:24:34,943
No, no.

1509
01:24:37,077 --> 01:24:38,278
Help me. Help me.

1510
01:24:38,412 --> 01:24:39,514
-Just calm down.
-Help me.

1511
01:24:39,647 --> 01:24:41,248
It's okay. It's over.

1512
01:24:44,786 --> 01:24:47,287
10-32 in the witness
viewing room.

1513
01:24:47,789 --> 01:24:48,823
Relax.

1514
01:24:49,489 --> 01:24:51,458
- Put the weapon down.
- He won't let me!

1515
01:24:51,593 --> 01:24:53,995
Put the weapon down,
doctor. Put it down.

1516
01:24:54,161 --> 01:24:55,262
He won't let me!

1517
01:24:55,395 --> 01:24:57,331
- Who won't let you?
- Him.

1518
01:24:59,266 --> 01:25:01,536
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Come on, doc.

1519
01:25:02,302 --> 01:25:03,503
It's been a long day.

1520
01:25:03,638 --> 01:25:05,073
Just give the detective
his gun back

1521
01:25:05,205 --> 01:25:07,474
-and we'll all go home.
-I was wrong.

1522
01:25:07,609 --> 01:25:09,911
Stay back. Stay back.
Give him room. Give him room.

1523
01:25:10,044 --> 01:25:12,212
I was wrong about everything.

1524
01:25:12,647 --> 01:25:15,516
-Take it easy.
-I was wrong about everything.

1525
01:25:16,784 --> 01:25:19,119
Stop. Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1526
01:25:19,554 --> 01:25:23,123
You don't want to do that,
doc. Come on. Doc.

1527
01:25:23,558 --> 01:25:24,659
God...

1528
01:25:27,194 --> 01:25:28,228
...help me.

1529
01:25:30,565 --> 01:25:31,599
Please...

1530
01:25:35,870 --> 01:25:37,404
Get him! Get him!

1531
01:25:37,538 --> 01:25:39,172
Grab the gun!

1532
01:25:39,306 --> 01:25:40,541
Grab the gun!

1533
01:25:41,408 --> 01:25:43,243
Secure it. Secure the gun.

1534
01:25:43,377 --> 01:25:44,679
I got the gun.
We got him.

1535
01:25:44,812 --> 01:25:47,915
Pin him down. Keep him down.
Keep him down!

1536
01:25:48,049 --> 01:25:48,983
Hold him down.

1537
01:25:54,454 --> 01:25:57,759
In five, four, three...

1538
01:25:59,159 --> 01:26:01,562
So, today a conversation

1539
01:26:01,696 --> 01:26:04,264
that I didn't think
would ever happen

1540
01:26:04,398 --> 01:26:06,333
especially with
our next guest.

1541
01:26:06,466 --> 01:26:09,236
-It is Dr. James Martin.
-Thanks, Glenn.

1542
01:26:09,369 --> 01:26:10,938
-Appreciate having me on.
-You're welcome.

1543
01:26:11,072 --> 01:26:13,373
So, you were the, the shrink,

1544
01:26:13,508 --> 01:26:16,443
you were the board-certified
psychiatrist

1545
01:26:16,577 --> 01:26:20,014
that actually
attended the execution

1546
01:26:20,148 --> 01:26:21,783
of Edward Wayne Brady.

1547
01:26:21,916 --> 01:26:23,651
-Yes. That's correct.
-You were there, um...

1548
01:26:23,785 --> 01:26:26,286
And it's because of
your determination

1549
01:26:26,420 --> 01:26:28,523
that he was finally executed.

1550
01:26:28,656 --> 01:26:31,693
My determination of his sanity
was the last step,

1551
01:26:31,826 --> 01:26:34,629
so to speak,
in the chain of events

1552
01:26:34,762 --> 01:26:37,031
that led to him
being executed.

1553
01:26:37,397 --> 01:26:38,833
Um, and now...

1554
01:26:40,101 --> 01:26:41,401
You've written a book.

1555
01:26:41,536 --> 01:26:42,770
Well, actually, um...

1556
01:26:43,771 --> 01:26:46,974
Actually, Mr. Brady,
or more correctly, the entity

1557
01:26:47,108 --> 01:26:50,210
claiming to inhabit Mr. Brady
wrote the initial manuscript.

1558
01:26:50,945 --> 01:26:54,481
I read that, and my first
thought was, "entity"?

1559
01:26:56,184 --> 01:26:58,786
Mr. Brady told me that
he was possessed by a demon.

1560
01:26:59,352 --> 01:27:00,487
You're a psychiatrist.

1561
01:27:00,621 --> 01:27:02,255
Did you believe him
at the time?

1562
01:27:02,389 --> 01:27:03,925
No.

1563
01:27:04,058 --> 01:27:05,392
But...

1564
01:27:06,928 --> 01:27:08,295
I believe him now.

1565
01:27:09,396 --> 01:27:10,631
So what changed?

1566
01:27:12,834 --> 01:27:14,367
The fact that
for a brief time,

1567
01:27:14,501 --> 01:27:17,805
the entity inhabited
me as well.

1568
01:27:18,673 --> 01:27:19,941
And again this "entity."

1569
01:27:20,074 --> 01:27:23,578
I mean, I can hear
Christians say, um, yeah.

1570
01:27:23,711 --> 01:27:27,615
"Entity. Fallen spirit.
Unclean spirit. Demon."

1571
01:27:28,616 --> 01:27:29,917
That's what he claimed to be.

1572
01:27:30,685 --> 01:27:32,019
Uh, so...

1573
01:27:33,955 --> 01:27:35,322
Let me go here.

1574
01:27:35,455 --> 01:27:38,593
You were in the witness room.

1575
01:27:38,726 --> 01:27:42,262
And you tried
to commit suicide.

1576
01:27:44,364 --> 01:27:45,666
It wasn't my choice.

1577
01:27:47,235 --> 01:27:50,437
See, uh, at that moment...

1578
01:27:54,341 --> 01:27:55,510
I was...

1579
01:27:56,210 --> 01:28:01,481
I was overtaken by an entity
so malevolent,

1580
01:28:01,616 --> 01:28:04,317
so powerful, so evil, that...

1581
01:28:05,887 --> 01:28:07,789
that words can't describe it.

1582
01:28:09,023 --> 01:28:10,658
I had control of my mind,

1583
01:28:10,792 --> 01:28:13,528
but the entity had
control of my body.

1584
01:28:14,327 --> 01:28:16,631
And so, against my will...

1585
01:28:17,532 --> 01:28:19,567
I grabbed
the detective's sidearm,

1586
01:28:20,400 --> 01:28:23,070
put the muzzle under my chin
and pulled the trigger.

1587
01:28:24,939 --> 01:28:25,973
But...

1588
01:28:27,675 --> 01:28:29,277
it didn't fire.

1589
01:28:29,409 --> 01:28:30,978
So, how do you explain that?

1590
01:28:34,481 --> 01:28:35,716
I... I can't.

1591
01:28:37,051 --> 01:28:38,052
Um...

1592
01:28:38,653 --> 01:28:39,787
According to
the ballistics team,

1593
01:28:39,921 --> 01:28:41,388
I pulled the trigger
three times.

1594
01:28:41,956 --> 01:28:44,391
And they could tell
because there were

1595
01:28:45,293 --> 01:28:47,862
three separate and distinct
strike imprints

1596
01:28:47,995 --> 01:28:50,131
from the firing pin on
the back of the shell casing.

1597
01:28:50,264 --> 01:28:54,769
And then when they attempted
in the ballistics lab later,

1598
01:28:54,902 --> 01:28:57,638
the fire, the same gun,
same cartridges...

1599
01:28:58,673 --> 01:29:00,107
It worked just fine.

1600
01:29:01,642 --> 01:29:02,877
A believer,

1601
01:29:03,544 --> 01:29:05,012
not a psychiatrist,
a man of science,

1602
01:29:05,146 --> 01:29:08,049
but a believer would say
you had an encounter.

1603
01:29:08,182 --> 01:29:10,818
Divine or demonic,
you had an encounter.

1604
01:29:11,686 --> 01:29:15,355
-Yeah.
-So why would this demonic

1605
01:29:16,524 --> 01:29:18,793
entity want you dead?

1606
01:29:20,127 --> 01:29:21,195
Punishment.

1607
01:29:21,329 --> 01:29:23,798
For not doing what he wanted.

1608
01:29:24,632 --> 01:29:25,867
So...

1609
01:29:27,902 --> 01:29:32,607
You are a complex kind of guy.

1610
01:29:32,740 --> 01:29:36,911
I mean, what happens
to an atheist,

1611
01:29:37,545 --> 01:29:40,948
uh, that is confronted
by demonic evil?

1612
01:29:42,283 --> 01:29:43,517
It shatters you.

1613
01:29:44,118 --> 01:29:48,656
And yet the same demon
that shatters you...

1614
01:29:50,324 --> 01:29:51,893
wrote a book, and you're here,

1615
01:29:52,026 --> 01:29:54,996
-and you wanted it published.
-Yes.

1616
01:29:56,264 --> 01:29:57,999
Well, no. I...

1617
01:30:01,002 --> 01:30:03,436
He wanted it written
as an invitation

1618
01:30:03,571 --> 01:30:07,308
to follow his master
into the darkness,

1619
01:30:07,440 --> 01:30:08,676
but I...

1620
01:30:10,077 --> 01:30:11,579
I rewrote it.

1621
01:30:12,780 --> 01:30:14,414
I rewrote it as a warning.

1622
01:30:15,716 --> 01:30:18,319
Revealing his plan
and begging people

1623
01:30:18,451 --> 01:30:19,854
not to go along with it.

1624
01:30:20,688 --> 01:30:23,991
So you're not
still doing his will?

1625
01:30:24,125 --> 01:30:25,726
No. Absolutely not.

1626
01:30:26,360 --> 01:30:28,696
Just logically, do you think
that's gonna work?

1627
01:30:28,829 --> 01:30:30,965
Do you think anybody
would believe you?

1628
01:30:32,400 --> 01:30:33,534
Only time will tell.

1629
01:30:33,668 --> 01:30:35,369
I mean, you,
do you believe you?

1630
01:30:35,502 --> 01:30:39,106
I mean, do you?
Are you a believer?

1631
01:30:40,908 --> 01:30:43,144
I don't know
if I'd go that far.

1632
01:30:44,845 --> 01:30:46,380
I mean, I suppose
I just have trouble

1633
01:30:46,514 --> 01:30:48,749
still accepting
the idea that, um...

1634
01:30:51,786 --> 01:30:53,020
I don't know.

1635
01:30:54,322 --> 01:30:56,223
You will. You'll get there.

1636
01:30:56,724 --> 01:30:58,359
You seem pretty sure of that.

1637
01:30:59,193 --> 01:31:04,699
Um, because you are
a logical person.

1638
01:31:04,832 --> 01:31:07,868
You're asking
logical questions.

1639
01:31:08,002 --> 01:31:09,704
Let me take you
a step further.

1640
01:31:09,837 --> 01:31:12,039
You are uniquely
qualified as somebody

1641
01:31:12,173 --> 01:31:17,578
who can delineate between
mental illness and possession.

1642
01:31:17,712 --> 01:31:18,679
I mean...

1643
01:31:18,813 --> 01:31:20,147
At least if you're any good.

1644
01:31:20,281 --> 01:31:22,016
I mean, assuming you're good.
Are you good?

1645
01:31:22,482 --> 01:31:23,818
I'd like to think so.

1646
01:31:24,585 --> 01:31:25,786
I'm guessing you are.

1647
01:31:26,354 --> 01:31:30,057
Despite the demon's
last words to you,

1648
01:31:30,191 --> 01:31:32,793
which I'm gonna butcher,
but they are...

1649
01:31:32,927 --> 01:31:36,130
<i>"Mene, mene, tekel, upharsin."</i>

1650
01:31:37,999 --> 01:31:39,633
"You've been
weighed in the balance

1651
01:31:39,767 --> 01:31:42,536
"and found wanting."

1652
01:31:47,708 --> 01:31:48,943
You know, um...

1653
01:31:50,778 --> 01:31:52,847
looking back, I, um...

1654
01:31:54,348 --> 01:31:55,883
I don't believe he was
just talking about me.

1655
01:31:56,017 --> 01:31:58,719
I think he was talking
about all of us.

1656
01:32:00,588 --> 01:32:03,257
There's a great battle
going on.

1657
01:32:03,391 --> 01:32:05,860
Whether we realize it or not.

1658
01:32:07,762 --> 01:32:09,563
The battle between
good and evil.

1659
01:32:09,697 --> 01:32:14,602
And... we're all participants.

1660
01:32:17,405 --> 01:32:18,507
Willing or not.

1661
01:32:19,340 --> 01:32:21,642
So I believe that,
but that is amazing

1662
01:32:22,443 --> 01:32:25,546
to hear from a non-believer.

1663
01:32:26,647 --> 01:32:28,149
Um... Thank you.

1664
01:32:28,282 --> 01:32:29,350
Thank you.

1665
01:32:30,317 --> 01:32:32,186
We've been talking
to Dr. James Martin.

1666
01:32:32,319 --> 01:32:34,355
He is the author of
the new book,

1667
01:32:34,488 --> 01:32:35,923
<i>A Nefarious Plot.</i>

1668
01:32:36,057 --> 01:32:38,826
You can find it wherever
books are sold.

1669
01:32:38,959 --> 01:32:40,861
-Thanks, doc.
-Thank you.

1670
01:32:44,999 --> 01:32:47,034
-Great interview, doc.
-Thanks so much.

1671
01:33:02,883 --> 01:33:04,118
Here you go.

1672
01:33:09,290 --> 01:33:10,324
Hello, James.

1673
01:33:13,528 --> 01:33:14,563
Miss me?
