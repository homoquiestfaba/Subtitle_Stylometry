What are you doing here?

7
00:01:19,512 --> 00:01:21,776
I just finished work
Want a ride?

00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:31,447

<i>As we heard earlier...</i>

15
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:28,409
What?

16
00:02:34,454 --> 00:02:35,785
What?

17
00:02:36,523 --> 00:02:37,649
Welcome back

18
00:02:37,757 --> 00:02:40,726
How'd you get back?

19
00:02:41,094 --> 00:02:42,493
What do you mean, how?

20
00:02:42,595 --> 00:02:46,122
Weren't you just at
Home lmprovements

21
00:02:46,232 --> 00:02:49,497
Home lmprovements?
Are you crazy?

22
00:02:49,802 --> 00:02:51,292
What?

23
00:02:52,672 --> 00:02:56,108
Oh, no, did I mistake
someone else for you?

24
00:02:57,777 --> 00:03:00,405
How embarrassing

25
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:12,817
Takashi, can you get the phone?

26
00:03:13,159 --> 00:03:15,491
I've got my hands full here.

27
00:03:25,972 --> 00:03:27,496
Yes, hello?

28
00:03:27,607 --> 00:03:31,873
<i>Nishimori Police here
ls this Nagai Takashi's residence?</i>

29
00:03:32,278 --> 00:03:33,267
Yes, it is

30
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:34,903
<i>And you are...</i>

31
00:03:35,315 --> 00:03:36,714
I'm Takashi's sister

32
00:03:36,816 --> 00:03:41,947
<i>I see. You'd better come
straight to the Chuo Hospital</i>

33
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:46,214
Um, um...
Did something happen to Takashi?

34
00:03:46,326 --> 00:03:48,317
<i>He just passed away</i>

35
00:03:49,362 --> 00:03:49,953

00:03:50,296 --> 00:03:53,197
<i>The investigating officer
believes it was a suicide</i>

37
00:03:53,299 --> 00:03:57,429
Oh, you have the wrong person
Takashi's here at home

38
00:03:58,605 --> 00:03:59,936
<i>But,</i>

39
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:04,137
<i>we got your number
from his student lD</i>

40
00:04:04,377 --> 00:04:07,175
Please wait a minute
I'll put him on the line

41
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:11,739
Takashi, will you come here?
There's a strange phone call

42
00:04:12,552 --> 00:04:13,951
Takashi?

43
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:49,554
Oh, no...

44
00:05:27,527 --> 00:05:28,858
Takashi?

45
00:05:38,538 --> 00:05:40,233
<i>At Medical Cytech Corp.,</i>

46
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:43,673

00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:16,069
Shut that damned thing off

55
00:06:16,175 --> 00:06:17,369
Yes

56
00:06:27,487 --> 00:06:28,818
I'm sorry

57
00:06:33,292 --> 00:06:34,486
Maybe my will's too weak

58
00:06:34,594 --> 00:06:36,118
Maybe so

59
00:06:36,996 --> 00:06:38,623
Takano, adjust the sensors

60
00:06:38,731 --> 00:06:39,720
Yes

61
00:06:48,641 --> 00:06:52,099
What are you doing. Aoki?
Record that data

62
00:06:52,211 --> 00:06:53,269
Yes

63
00:06:59,018 --> 00:07:02,419
Don't you think we should try
simplifying the information stream?

64
00:07:02,622 --> 00:07:03,680
What?

65
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:06,782
I mean, the human will
is fairly complex

66
00:07:07,326 --> 00:07:10,193
We've known that all along

67
00:07:10,396 --> 00:07:11,795
Well, yes

68
00:07:12,198 --> 00:07:15,395
The product's useless unless
it obeys commands universally

69
00:07:16,302 --> 00:07:20,204
That's why it makes sense
to try simplifying it

70
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:25,705
I thought the point was to rep icate
the complexity of human behavior

71
00:07:25,812 --> 00:07:28,576
Get with it

72
00:07:29,816 --> 00:07:30,976
Yes

73
00:07:32,585 --> 00:07:34,212
Say, Hayasaki

74
00:07:34,921 --> 00:07:39,358
Didn't you once say you wanted
to develop a new pacemaker?

75
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:41,786
Yeah

76
00:07:44,063 --> 00:07:47,260
Got any?
Good ideas?

77
00:07:48,935 --> 00:07:50,129
Nope

78
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:54,363
Oh, right

79
00:07:54,674 --> 00:07:56,301
Get to the point

80
00:07:56,709 --> 00:07:59,678
What?

81
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:03,378
That project would be easier
to allocate funds for

82
00:08:04,951 --> 00:08:07,613
Since when were you
my enemy?

83
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:08,914
What?

84
00:08:10,623 --> 00:08:13,251
We're all on your side

85
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:16,785
You have no enemies
in this corporation

86
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:20,363
We a l ive off that b ood pressure
instrument of yours

87
00:08:20,466 --> 00:08:22,798
Don't talk about the ancient past

88
00:08:22,902 --> 00:08:23,994
Sorry

89
00:08:24,437 --> 00:08:27,770
I'l get the funding
Keep on working

90
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:35,575
Try not to be such a perfectionist

91
00:09:46,352 --> 00:09:47,614
Do you need that data?

92
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:52,555
No, I don't!
Who needs a useless log of failures

93
00:09:53,092 --> 00:09:55,856
- Here you are
- Thanks

94
00:09:55,962 --> 00:09:58,624
We all work too hard

95
00:10:01,067 --> 00:10:02,432
You're right

96
00:10:05,137 --> 00:10:08,038
Can I ask you something?

97
00:10:08,207 --> 00:10:10,437
Sure, what?

98
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:15,770
Do you be ieve in paranormal
phenomenon, Hayasaki san?

99
00:10:16,549 --> 00:10:20,007
No, I don't
That stuff on TV, right?

100
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:24,455
The brother of a friend of mine,
ki led himself recent y

101
00:10:24,557 --> 00:10:25,581
Huh

102
00:10:25,691 --> 00:10:27,682
And according to his sister,

103
00:10:27,994 --> 00:10:33,022
he died because he'd
seen his doppelganger

104
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:34,925
Doppelganger?

105
00:10:35,034 --> 00:10:38,834
Like a double
They say if you see it, you die

106
00:10:39,572 --> 00:10:40,732
But,

107
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:45,174
some psychologists claim
to have similar cases

108
00:10:45,578 --> 00:10:48,638
When people see
their exact double

109
00:10:49,615 --> 00:10:52,914
I imagine her brother
was in denial

110
00:10:53,252 --> 00:10:57,348
That he was burdened
with some terrible pressure

111
00:10:58,090 --> 00:10:59,819
What's your opinion?

112
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:07,330
My opinion?
Sorry, I'm not interested

113
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:15,402
Hey there
Key please

114
00:11:19,278 --> 00:11:23,738
Hey, it's gone
Didn't you take it?

115
00:11:23,849 --> 00:11:26,249
- No, no, I didn't
- What?

116
00:14:15,621 --> 00:14:18,920
Yeah, I'm much better now

117
00:14:20,726 --> 00:14:21,920
What?

118
00:14:22,895 --> 00:14:26,160
I haven't touched his room

119
00:14:26,465 --> 00:14:29,866
I can't just throw away his things

120
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:33,604
Yeah, more or less

121
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:39,234
I'm fine
Don't worry

122
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:44,475
Yeah, yeah...
Thanks

123
00:14:57,363 --> 00:15:00,127
I'l call you

124
00:15:00,499 --> 00:15:05,334
Yeah, bye, now

125
00:15:43,509 --> 00:15:47,843
The President wants to
promote you to management

126
00:15:48,013 --> 00:15:49,378
What do you say?

127
00:15:51,583 --> 00:15:55,246
I think it's a nice way of
kicking you out of research

128
00:15:56,722 --> 00:16:01,716
Isn't it about time
you considered taking it easy?

129
00:16:02,695 --> 00:16:06,324
A management position
isn't so bad, you know

130
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:10,098
Murakami, I'll never work
for anyone but myself

131
00:16:10,202 --> 00:16:14,070
When you don't need me, fire me
Tell that to the President

132
00:16:14,907 --> 00:16:17,341
All right, I will

133
00:16:19,511 --> 00:16:21,001
It's just...

134
00:16:22,214 --> 00:16:26,878
For you to continue your research,
we need a little ritual. You understand

135
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:29,079
No, no way

136
00:16:29,188 --> 00:16:31,918
That machine isn't ready yet

137
00:16:32,224 --> 00:16:36,627
Don't be so stubborn
It's your duty to report on your work

138
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:40,193
I'll write up a report
But I won't unveil the machine

139
00:16:40,899 --> 00:16:44,835
I told you, it's just for the executives
A hoop to jump through

140
00:16:45,704 --> 00:16:50,698
lf you have to show it to them,
just take it! Leave me out of it

141
00:17:22,775 --> 00:17:24,072
I'll go make some coffee

142
00:17:24,176 --> 00:17:25,234
Yeah

143
00:17:33,285 --> 00:17:34,616
Are you OK?

144
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:36,414
Yeah

145
00:17:37,022 --> 00:17:38,751
Is it Murakami san?

146
00:17:39,758 --> 00:17:41,282
No, that's not it

147
00:17:42,594 --> 00:17:44,459
Recently I've been...

148
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:46,588
You've been what?

149
00:17:49,435 --> 00:17:51,596
Someone's been stalking me

150
00:17:52,137 --> 00:17:53,934
Sta king?

151
00:17:54,673 --> 00:17:57,699
Wow, that's a drag

152
00:17:58,243 --> 00:18:01,838
Is it a woman?
Or a man?

153
00:18:11,423 --> 00:18:14,859
- Oh, thanks
- Sure

154
00:18:22,468 --> 00:18:23,992
Listen, Takano

155
00:18:24,536 --> 00:18:27,801
Remember that...
Who was it?

156
00:18:28,607 --> 00:18:32,737
The person you know
whose brother killed himself?

157
00:18:32,845 --> 00:18:33,937
Yeah

158
00:18:35,047 --> 00:18:37,038
How's she been, since?

159
00:18:37,316 --> 00:18:40,513
She said things had settled down

160
00:18:40,819 --> 00:18:42,081
Huh...

161
00:18:45,424 --> 00:18:47,517
And her brother?

162
00:18:49,661 --> 00:18:52,630
I mean that, the...

163
00:18:53,232 --> 00:18:55,530
Doppel... ganger?

164
00:18:56,101 --> 00:18:59,332
But her brother's dead

165
00:19:01,406 --> 00:19:04,204
Oh, right, right, right

166
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:08,609
That's right
Silly me

167
00:19:37,576 --> 00:19:40,101
Maybe I'm cracking up...

168
00:19:44,983 --> 00:19:47,383
- Welcome
- Welcome

169
00:19:48,287 --> 00:19:50,653
- Anyone joining you?
- Oh, no

170
00:20:05,103 --> 00:20:08,004
Call me when you're ready

171
00:20:08,106 --> 00:20:09,471
The same

172
00:20:09,575 --> 00:20:10,633
What?

173
00:20:10,909 --> 00:20:13,434
Like I said, the same

174
00:20:15,781 --> 00:20:17,510
The same as what, sir?

175
00:20:18,483 --> 00:20:19,814
What's that?

176
00:20:20,819 --> 00:20:22,878
- Coffee
- That, then

177
00:20:23,322 --> 00:20:24,812
Right away

178
00:20:34,499 --> 00:20:35,966
Thank you

179
00:20:51,183 --> 00:20:54,152
You're really stuck, aren't you?

180
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:56,954
Get out
This is my house

181
00:20:57,289 --> 00:20:58,085
Huh?

182
00:20:58,190 --> 00:20:59,851
I'll call the police

183
00:21:04,129 --> 00:21:07,360
Like you're such a hotshot

184
00:21:25,384 --> 00:21:26,976
Who are you?

185
00:21:27,085 --> 00:21:30,384
Me? I'm you

186
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:33,590
I'm Hayasaki Michio

187
00:21:33,692 --> 00:21:36,126
I'm Hayasaki Michio, too

188
00:21:37,429 --> 00:21:39,659
What kind of nonsense is this?

189
00:21:40,499 --> 00:21:42,399
Just hurry up and disappear

190
00:21:43,001 --> 00:21:47,597
What do you mean? I turned up
here because fe t sorry for you

191
00:21:49,241 --> 00:21:52,233
I'm overworked
I'm losing my mind

192
00:21:56,848 --> 00:22:00,249
Hey, what are you doing?

193
00:22:00,352 --> 00:22:01,717
I'm hallucinating

194
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:09,993
Man, you're uptight

195
00:22:12,097 --> 00:22:15,191
I'm offering
to help you accomplish

196
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:17,564
what you can't do on your own

197
00:22:19,104 --> 00:22:23,564
Hard to dream up
a better partner

198
00:22:23,675 --> 00:22:26,337
I still hear him

199
00:22:29,848 --> 00:22:31,748
You all right?

200
00:22:32,651 --> 00:22:37,452
The figment's saying something
I can't listen

201
00:22:39,391 --> 00:22:41,018
That's just it

202
00:22:41,293 --> 00:22:44,558
This inflexibility of yours
has been dragging you down

203
00:22:44,663 --> 00:22:49,327
Why the hell do I have to
listen to me lecturing myself?

204
00:22:49,801 --> 00:22:53,237
You've got big plans, remember?

205
00:22:54,206 --> 00:22:57,175
I have no intention of
discussing them with you

206
00:22:57,275 --> 00:22:58,742
Neither do I

207
00:23:22,467 --> 00:23:23,832
Get out

208
00:23:32,911 --> 00:23:34,310
All right

209
00:23:47,426 --> 00:23:51,419
And...
stop driving around in my car

210
00:23:51,696 --> 00:23:54,563
I had to walk home
because of you

211
00:23:55,333 --> 00:23:57,233
And you.

212
00:23:58,470 --> 00:24:00,870
stop calling me a sta ker

213
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:10,610
Everything's ready.
Hayasaki san

214
00:24:12,651 --> 00:24:14,209
Right

215
00:24:24,095 --> 00:24:26,120
Let's begin

216
00:25:04,269 --> 00:25:05,566
Are you OK?

217
00:25:06,037 --> 00:25:07,231
Yeah

218
00:25:07,639 --> 00:25:09,504
We pulled it off

219
00:25:12,544 --> 00:25:14,444
Pulled what off?

220
00:25:16,114 --> 00:25:18,480
That's not an artificial body

221
00:25:19,618 --> 00:25:23,850
The way Murakami applauded
How tota ly humiliating

222
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:31,754
Can I say something,
Hayasaki san?

223
00:25:33,565 --> 00:25:36,693
I think you need to consider
Murakami san's fee ings

224
00:25:37,435 --> 00:25:39,528
You're a genius, Hayasaki san

225
00:25:39,905 --> 00:25:42,840
No one knows that better
than Murakami san

226
00:25:43,608 --> 00:25:47,567
In addition, you're
in a slump right now

227
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:49,904
Get to the point

228
00:25:56,388 --> 00:25:59,880
We're all hoping,
all us employees are

229
00:26:00,292 --> 00:26:03,261
That you'll come up with
another amazing invention

230
00:26:03,428 --> 00:26:04,292
That's why

231
00:26:04,396 --> 00:26:09,060
Murakami san and I are trying,
somehow, to pull you out of your slump

232
00:26:09,834 --> 00:26:14,066
I'm hardly much use,
so it's not for me to say

233
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:18,303
But I'm incredibly proud
to be working with you

234
00:26:19,477 --> 00:26:23,004
Let's work hard
And meet their expectations

235
00:26:26,718 --> 00:26:29,482
They only think of themse ves

236
00:26:32,891 --> 00:26:35,917
A heavy load, huh?
Their expectations

237
00:26:36,828 --> 00:26:38,056
Yeah...

238
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:51,099
What are you staring at?

239
00:26:53,211 --> 00:26:56,877
The budget's up 150%
No complaints, right ?

240
00:26:57,082 --> 00:26:58,174
Right

241
00:26:59,317 --> 00:27:03,617
Now you get to buy that
super computer you wanted

242
00:27:04,856 --> 00:27:07,450
OK, right?
Sign off on it

243
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:10,992
When we perform that ritual
for our President next month,

244
00:27:12,797 --> 00:27:16,824
let's give him a real nice shock

245
00:27:37,489 --> 00:27:39,582
Leave everything to me

246
00:29:45,383 --> 00:29:50,320
Hayasaki
You did this

247
00:29:51,055 --> 00:29:55,321
Do you hate my way of
doing things so much?

248
00:30:00,899 --> 00:30:02,560
You're incomprehensible

249
00:30:07,906 --> 00:30:09,373
Hi, Takano?

250
00:30:09,941 --> 00:30:13,035
No, no, forget it
I've been fired

251
00:30:13,745 --> 00:30:16,373
No, no, it's fine I've been fired

252
00:30:17,081 --> 00:30:19,242
Yeah, that's right

253
00:30:21,019 --> 00:30:23,886
It's strange
I'm kind of relieved

254
00:30:24,989 --> 00:30:29,221
Actually, I'd hit my limit

255
00:30:30,128 --> 00:30:32,858
I see, he's still here?

256
00:30:33,364 --> 00:30:34,592
He is

257
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:36,731
The doppelganger?

258
00:30:37,268 --> 00:30:40,135
I don't know
But he's there

259
00:30:40,538 --> 00:30:43,530
In my house
Even now

260
00:30:48,279 --> 00:30:52,079
And what's this other brother
of yours doing at home?

261
00:30:52,217 --> 00:30:53,741
Writing a novel

262
00:30:53,852 --> 00:30:55,183
A novel?

263
00:30:55,486 --> 00:30:59,650
Yes, the deadline for
the Newcomer's Award

264
00:31:00,091 --> 00:31:02,616
that magazine sponsors
is coming up

265
00:31:04,662 --> 00:31:08,154
Takashi always dreamed
of winning it

266
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:09,792
I see

267
00:31:11,002 --> 00:31:15,598
But the Takashi I knew
was never that way

268
00:31:17,508 --> 00:31:21,569
He was a slacker,
weak-willed.

269
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:24,007
totally dependent on me

270
00:31:27,752 --> 00:31:32,348
Frank y, I'm happier
with the new Takashi

271
00:31:33,758 --> 00:31:36,556
- But...
- My brother

272
00:31:36,794 --> 00:31:39,820
probably met his ideaI self

273
00:31:39,998 --> 00:31:42,626
and wound up facing
his own limitations

274
00:31:43,067 --> 00:31:47,470
That's why I think
he killed himself

275
00:31:50,375 --> 00:31:52,400
How are things with you?

276
00:31:57,582 --> 00:31:59,948
I'm sorry. I wasn't istening
What?

277
00:32:00,084 --> 00:32:03,451
Oh...
How are things with you?

278
00:32:03,588 --> 00:32:08,321
Oh, my situation
is hardly that serious

279
00:32:09,294 --> 00:32:11,125
I see

280
00:32:11,829 --> 00:32:15,287
In that case,
you'll get used to it

281
00:32:16,901 --> 00:32:18,198
You have no choice

282
00:33:17,328 --> 00:33:20,695
Hey, lazybones
Off we go

283
00:33:22,367 --> 00:33:25,859
This is hardly the time to
brood over the past

284
00:33:25,970 --> 00:33:30,771
That's exactly the thing
that's holding you back

285
00:33:30,875 --> 00:33:32,001
Hey!

286
00:33:33,878 --> 00:33:38,247
Hey, off we go!
Hey

287
00:33:39,450 --> 00:33:41,042
Off we go

288
00:33:41,586 --> 00:33:46,523
Hey, c'mon, we're going
Hey

289
00:33:53,965 --> 00:33:55,830
Hey, hey
Hold on now

290
00:34:27,832 --> 00:34:29,424
OK, here we go

291
00:34:31,269 --> 00:34:32,429
No

292
00:34:32,937 --> 00:34:34,336
Why not?

293
00:34:35,606 --> 00:34:39,372
I don't have a c ue
what's going on anymore

294
00:34:40,445 --> 00:34:45,382
What'll we do with you?
Stop whining

295
00:34:45,483 --> 00:34:47,849
No, no, no, no!

296
00:34:53,458 --> 00:34:54,789
I can't do it alone

297
00:34:54,892 --> 00:34:56,450
Leave me alone!

298
00:35:00,765 --> 00:35:01,754
Hey

299
00:35:02,567 --> 00:35:05,263
- Hayasaki san
- You still working?

300
00:35:05,369 --> 00:35:09,203
Yes
What brings you here?

301
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:11,401
Not to worry

302
00:35:27,558 --> 00:35:29,819
Shall I help you?

303
00:35:30,795 --> 00:35:31,819
Huh?

304
00:35:41,305 --> 00:35:42,567
Takano...

305
00:35:44,842 --> 00:35:49,176
I'm sorry
It's all my fault

306
00:35:50,281 --> 00:35:53,375
It's an honor to be of service

307
00:36:01,325 --> 00:36:05,785
OK, OK, OK, stop

308
00:36:22,313 --> 00:36:25,612
- Thanks
- Oh, no

309
00:36:26,217 --> 00:36:29,277
- Make up some story for Murakami
- Yes

310
00:36:30,321 --> 00:36:31,413
Here

311
00:36:34,926 --> 00:36:36,723
Excuse me

312
00:36:39,730 --> 00:36:41,425
I'll remember you...

313
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:47,394
for the rest of my life

314
00:36:48,806 --> 00:36:50,239
Me, too

315
00:36:57,215 --> 00:36:58,477
Takano

316
00:36:59,784 --> 00:37:00,910
Yes?

317
00:37:19,036 --> 00:37:20,594
What the hell have you done!

318
00:37:21,672 --> 00:37:22,764
What?

319
00:37:23,608 --> 00:37:26,975
To Takano,
by the door back there

320
00:37:27,111 --> 00:37:28,169
Nothing

321
00:37:28,479 --> 00:37:29,878
Liar!

322
00:37:31,115 --> 00:37:33,242
I only did what you wanted to

323
00:37:33,484 --> 00:37:35,679
I knew you did it

324
00:37:37,488 --> 00:37:38,682
Did what?

325
00:38:55,833 --> 00:38:58,301
I'll leave your lunch here

326
00:39:00,071 --> 00:39:01,436
Don't bother me

327
00:39:24,395 --> 00:39:26,625
My brother's gone

328
00:39:27,198 --> 00:39:28,392
Really?

329
00:39:30,801 --> 00:39:33,031
He's totally different

330
00:39:33,304 --> 00:39:37,263
<i>He doesn't seem
to need me anymore</i>

331
00:39:37,875 --> 00:39:39,399
Huh...

332
00:39:40,911 --> 00:39:44,813
He's someone else
He's not Takashi

333
00:39:45,416 --> 00:39:47,247
Even though he looks the same

334
00:39:47,852 --> 00:39:49,843
Of course he is

335
00:39:52,656 --> 00:39:55,625
What am I supposed to do?

336
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:59,188
ls Takashi finally, really dead?

337
00:39:59,296 --> 00:40:00,820
Or will have to keep dealing

338
00:40:00,931 --> 00:40:04,332
with that completely different,
other Takashi forever?

339
00:40:04,435 --> 00:40:07,404
That's a tough one

340
00:40:08,172 --> 00:40:10,037
Yes, it is

341
00:40:14,145 --> 00:40:15,772
But, you know

342
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:20,180
I think the doppe ganger and
the self are entirely distinct

343
00:40:20,518 --> 00:40:24,181
Oh, that's right, you said so, too
That he was a different person

344
00:40:24,455 --> 00:40:27,015
So...

345
00:40:27,391 --> 00:40:30,053
It's like having a twin,

346
00:40:31,028 --> 00:40:35,055
or a chance resemb ance, so...

347
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:37,131
So...

348
00:40:37,234 --> 00:40:39,759
So... right

349
00:40:39,870 --> 00:40:44,830
I think it means your brother's
finally really dead

350
00:40:47,711 --> 00:40:49,110
You think so?

351
00:40:49,213 --> 00:40:50,407
Yeah

352
00:40:55,219 --> 00:40:56,481
Awful

353
00:40:58,989 --> 00:41:00,047
It's too awful

354
00:41:00,157 --> 00:41:03,490
That's not what I meant

355
00:41:04,128 --> 00:41:08,292
What did I do to deserve this?

356
00:41:18,909 --> 00:41:23,972
I'm starting...
to not give a damn anymore

357
00:41:38,629 --> 00:41:39,823
Sorry

358
00:41:40,798 --> 00:41:45,462
Leave everything to me
OK?

359
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:13,586
What the fuck!
Hey! Get off!

360
00:43:16,226 --> 00:43:20,458
- Move!
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry, sorry

361
00:43:27,738 --> 00:43:28,966
Excuse me, I'm sorry

362
00:43:29,073 --> 00:43:31,564
I'm sorry, I'm sorry

363
00:44:12,116 --> 00:44:13,981
You, again

364
00:44:18,589 --> 00:44:20,750
This thing's pretty handy

365
00:44:20,858 --> 00:44:22,758
Don't touch my machine

366
00:44:38,509 --> 00:44:42,104
Hey. hey, hey
Don't eat that crap

367
00:44:42,346 --> 00:44:45,406
Look, I brought you
some yummy stuff

368
00:45:01,165 --> 00:45:03,190
Wow, looks good

369
00:45:19,883 --> 00:45:22,374
Did you do something bad?

370
00:45:22,486 --> 00:45:24,579
Don't be such a wimp

371
00:45:26,390 --> 00:45:29,416
I'm going to wind up
responsible for everything

372
00:45:30,127 --> 00:45:31,526
The cops?

373
00:45:32,229 --> 00:45:36,029
Why do you think like that?
It's just the opposite

374
00:45:37,234 --> 00:45:39,794
Whatever you do,

375
00:45:40,137 --> 00:45:44,198
as long as I get caught,
you're safe

376
00:45:46,643 --> 00:45:49,669
Can't you even figure that out?

377
00:45:51,515 --> 00:45:54,313
Not that I really care

378
00:46:01,125 --> 00:46:05,425
Just get out of here
I've got a ton to do

379
00:46:07,431 --> 00:46:10,832
AlI right, that's the way

380
00:46:13,637 --> 00:46:18,006
OK, then
I'll be off

381
00:46:27,251 --> 00:46:29,947
You are pleased, right?

382
00:46:53,210 --> 00:46:54,336
What are you?

383
00:46:55,078 --> 00:46:56,670
I was told to come here

384
00:46:56,980 --> 00:46:57,969
What?

385
00:46:58,182 --> 00:47:01,481
Your brother hired me

386
00:47:11,895 --> 00:47:15,524
Wow, so this is
the artificial whatever

387
00:47:15,666 --> 00:47:17,190
Pretty tacky

388
00:47:17,634 --> 00:47:21,126
Shut up
Put that stuff over here

389
00:47:27,377 --> 00:47:29,470
So, what do I do?

390
00:47:29,580 --> 00:47:31,172
Sit here

391
00:47:39,323 --> 00:47:40,585
For real?

392
00:47:40,691 --> 00:47:44,821
Yeah, it's for real, real
You're an emp oyee. No back-talk

393
00:48:00,711 --> 00:48:02,508
Try grabbing this

394
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:03,938
What?

395
00:48:04,882 --> 00:48:08,943
Here goes...

396
00:48:13,824 --> 00:48:14,984

00:48:21,531 --> 00:48:23,226
You fuckin' around?

398
00:48:23,734 --> 00:48:26,601
I am not
I can't grab it

399
00:48:30,073 --> 00:48:32,064
Your wil 's too weak

400
00:48:34,845 --> 00:48:38,906
Get out of there
Start over

401
00:48:40,317 --> 00:48:43,548
You look exact y like him
Your brother

402
00:48:45,088 --> 00:48:46,180
What?

403
00:48:47,724 --> 00:48:51,387
It creeps me out
Like you're his double

404
00:48:54,398 --> 00:48:58,926
Don't say that
Ever again, got that?

405
00:48:59,169 --> 00:49:00,761
Lift both arms

406
00:49:07,177 --> 00:49:08,610
Good

407
00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:12,640
That's good, good, good

408
00:49:13,784 --> 00:49:16,981
OK, now slowly try
raising them to your sides

409
00:49:25,362 --> 00:49:26,954
Good

410
00:49:28,332 --> 00:49:31,062
OK, lower them

Why'd you take 'em off
They're cool

416
00:50:38,035 --> 00:50:39,195
Shut up

417
00:50:39,369 --> 00:50:41,098
