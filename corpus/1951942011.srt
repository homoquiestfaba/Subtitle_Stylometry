Translated by Suurtje 
control: Suurtje and Teq -- 

25 
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:31,463 
Since the beginning of time, travel 
a space to dream. 

26 
00:00:31,563 --> 00:00:34,065 
The rocket made sure the 
reality was. 

27 
00:00:34,165 --> 00:00:38,098 
But before these people gigantic 
step were proud ... 

28 
00:00:38,198 --> 00:00:40,314 
the brave stepped into the rocket. 

29 
00:00:40,414 --> 00:00:43,631 
And the brave were chimpanzees. 

30 
00:00:46,638 --> 00:00:48,597 
Ham I was the first American ... 

31 
00:00:48,598 --> 00:00:52,415 
who was outspoken in which no man or 
chimpanzee had been previously. 

32 
00:00:52,481 --> 00:00:56,233 
And tonight his brave legacy lives on. 

33 
00:00:56,333 --> 00:01:03,888 
I suggest to you Ham III. 
Ham his only real grandson. 

34 
00:01:04,215 --> 00:01:06,587 
Thank you, no signatures. 
Give Photos. 

35 
00:01:06,687 --> 00:01:09,474 
Well, then do photos. 
Which I sign later. 

36 
00:01:10,045 --> 00:01:16,158 
Ladies and gentlemen, you make, if we 
on a mission to the stars go. 

37 
00:01:16,193 --> 00:01:19,899 
The space, stars, enough with the lessons, 
let's do something about this. 

38 
00:01:19,999 --> 00:01:22,919 
Do you have to wear seatbelts. 
- Kin down, "thumb claw" to the inside ... 

39 
00:01:23,019 --> 00:01:25,493 
if you make sure you do not include 
me, Houston. The area is in my veins. 

40 
00:01:25,593 --> 00:01:28,028 
And between your ears. 
- It is time for the show. 

41 
00:01:28,128 --> 00:01:32,855 
Come on. Make some noise. 
We are going crazy. 

42 
00:01:33,815 --> 00:01:36,408 
Let you be surprised. 

43 
00:01:36,508 --> 00:01:38,281 
Let this candle lighting. 

44 
00:01:39,131 --> 00:01:42,407 
Three, two, one ... 

45 
00:01:42,507 --> 00:01:44,273 
takeoff. 

46 
00:01:47,992 --> 00:01:50,692 
Ladies. 

47 
00:02:02,772 --> 00:02:04,799 
And back again. 

48 
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:08,269 
It seems like a dream. 

49 
00:02:08,369 --> 00:02:10,620 
Keep your eyes on 
the landing gear. 

50 
00:02:11,639 --> 00:02:15,979 
No nonsense. Stay focused on your goal. 

51 
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:18,330 
The grand finale is coming. 

52 
00:02:19,153 --> 00:02:21,216 
And a KOPROL. 

53 
00:02:21,217 --> 00:02:25,696 
And a 'Dipsy'. 
And a duke. " 

54 
00:02:40,744 --> 00:02:43,423 
Always steal the show. 

55 
00:02:45,761 --> 00:02:50,002 
It is okay people. 
Therefore, I have the helmet when the monkey gained. 

56 
00:03:01,662 --> 00:03:06,575 
The infinity probe 'is successful 
'Luna Orbit' passed. 

57 
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:09,311 
The status is unmanned and 
remotely operated. 

58 
00:03:09,731 --> 00:03:14,250 
Mission: "to look for life." 

59 
00:03:15,976 --> 00:03:19,499 
Discovered unidentified 
space details. 

60 
00:03:20,142 --> 00:03:23,106 
Warning: 'system works poorly. " 

61 
00:03:23,107 --> 00:03:25,474 
System works poorly. 

62 
00:03:43,058 --> 00:03:45,662 
Come here, little butterfly. 

63 
00:03:48,902 --> 00:03:51,453 
No, Zartog. 

64 
00:03:52,702 --> 00:03:56,416 
You can not read. 
Stay at my house away. 

65 
00:04:00,666 --> 00:04:03,598 
Sample. 

66 
00:04:04,913 --> 00:04:08,597 
If I could get you to tackle rogue, 
I would also yours in the 'Fresnar' stop. 

67 
00:04:08,598 --> 00:04:10,879 
I wonder why everyone 
in the city you hate. 

68 
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:13,163 
I also like to have. 

69 
00:04:14,937 --> 00:04:18,351 
Look, it comes closer. 
- It is a beast from the air. 

70 
00:04:22,223 --> 00:04:24,645 
My house. 

71 
00:04:28,768 --> 00:04:31,555 
A gift from the air. 

72 
00:04:43,206 --> 00:04:46,273 
I am the 'Infinity Probe' of 
the planet Earth. 

73 
00:04:46,274 --> 00:04:49,325 
We will now have a fully 
physical research. 

74 
00:04:49,326 --> 00:04:52,371 
Only for scientific 
purposes. 

75 
00:04:59,972 --> 00:05:03,022 
Since the beginning of the time 
the unbridled spirit of man ... 

76 
00:05:03,023 --> 00:05:05,745 
great achievements made 
in culture and civilization. 

77 
00:05:05,746 --> 00:05:10,884 
This creativity is reflected in architecture, 
art, music, design ... 

78 
00:05:10,885 --> 00:05:14,050 
but people do not always 
He would also like to play. 

79 
00:05:14,051 --> 00:05:16,501 
So let me live. 

80 
00:05:23,964 --> 00:05:26,927 
The audit of the information system 
in business. 

81 
00:05:29,641 --> 00:05:32,230 
Manual override takes place. 

82 
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:53,262 
A new day has come, and 
that day is Zartog. 

83 
00:06:05,306 --> 00:06:08,784 
A amphibians program 
began in the sixties. 

84 
00:06:09,218 --> 00:06:12,045 
And these chimpanzees are like those 
which are used in the first space travel. 

85 
00:06:12,145 --> 00:06:13,668 
Why, they go to space? 

86 
00:06:13,768 --> 00:06:17,069 
They do not. They let alone 
see the past. 

87 
00:06:21,952 --> 00:06:23,570 
What is it, Comet? 

88 
00:06:23,670 --> 00:06:26,416 
I do not know, but it is 
something big. 

89 
00:06:26,516 --> 00:06:28,098 
What do you mean, gone? 

90 
00:06:28,198 --> 00:06:31,351 
Senator, the Infinity from his stance 
waived by ... 

91 
00:06:31,451 --> 00:06:34,108 
a magnetic attraction 
one-dimensional deviation ... 

92 
00:06:34,208 --> 00:06:35,806 
in time, space continuum. 

93 
00:06:35,902 --> 00:06:37,953 
In English. 

94 
00:06:37,954 --> 00:06:39,766 
It is sucked into a wormhole. 

95 
00:06:39,767 --> 00:06:43,335 
My constituents care about holes 
no worm holes. 

96 
00:06:43,336 --> 00:06:46,692 
You know how many holes we can leave 
for five trillion dollars? 

97 
00:06:47,842 --> 00:06:50,042 
Strength three. 

98 
00:06:54,013 --> 00:06:57,850 
50,600,000, which depends on 
off the track. 

99 
00:06:57,947 --> 00:06:59,249 
Labor costs. 
- And overtime. 

100 
00:06:59,345 --> 00:07:01,781 
It was just a question, dab. 

101 
00:07:01,782 --> 00:07:05,694 
Our data show that the 'Infinity' is 
have emerged on the other side of the universe. 

102 
00:07:05,695 --> 00:07:07,727 
As you can see from this picture ... 

103 
00:07:07,728 --> 00:07:12,034 
is the 'Infinity' landed on a planet 
in a large field with H2O. 

104 
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:17,435 
That means water. 
- I know what it means. 

105 
00:07:17,436 --> 00:07:19,708 
Senator, as the atmosphere 
life is fruitful ... 

106 
00:07:19,709 --> 00:07:21,316 
would there be life on the planet. 

107 
00:07:21,317 --> 00:07:23,182 
Perhaps even more extensive form. 

108 
00:07:23,183 --> 00:07:25,466 
This could prove what we 
all the time had already suspected. 

109 
00:07:25,975 --> 00:07:27,736 
We are not alone. 

110 
00:07:27,737 --> 00:07:30,525 
Imagine what a mission 
Science could do. 

111 
00:07:30,526 --> 00:07:32,487 
Not to mention the sale of T shirts. 

112 
00:07:32,488 --> 00:07:35,665 
Political gold. I would immediately 
astronauts to have. 

113 
00:07:35,666 --> 00:07:37,702 
That does not happen. 
Too dangerous for humans. 

114 
00:07:37,703 --> 00:07:40,177 
We have no idea how effect 
the wormhole has on human tissue. 

115 
00:07:40,178 --> 00:07:42,272 
It would be the DNA can change. 

116 
00:07:42,273 --> 00:07:44,053 
You would be blind. 
- Heart problems. 

117 
00:07:44,054 --> 00:07:46,252 
Very likely, death. 

118 
00:07:46,705 --> 00:07:48,453 
Moving. 

119 
00:07:52,387 --> 00:07:54,310 
What are you doing? 

120 
00:07:54,311 --> 00:07:56,747 
Our mission delivery. 

121 
00:08:07,903 --> 00:08:10,225 
We were able to send the chimpanzees. 
- Chimpanzees? 

122 
00:08:10,226 --> 00:08:13,988 
Chimpanzees? No people, but 
not horrible. 

123 
00:08:13,989 --> 00:08:16,353 
Tell me what you got. 
- Guys, we have a mission. 

124 
00:08:16,453 --> 00:08:20,562 
Senator, Titan, Luna, and Comet are fully 
prepared for the mission. 

125 
00:08:20,563 --> 00:08:23,486 
They have their whole life 
trained for. 

126 
00:08:24,496 --> 00:08:27,146 
Training, worthless. 
Those chimpanzees are boring. 

127 
00:08:27,147 --> 00:08:29,099 
They are gawky chimpanzee. 

128 
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:31,740 
I can not believe it. 
There are no gawky in their world. 

129 
00:08:31,741 --> 00:08:34,552 
I know a Klungel when I see one. 

130 
00:08:34,553 --> 00:08:36,694 
Do you think he means that 
we are gawky? 

131 
00:08:36,695 --> 00:08:38,700 
No, we are super cool. 

132 
00:08:38,701 --> 00:08:41,234 
What this mission needs is what 
publicity. 

133 
00:08:41,235 --> 00:08:44,039 
What crackling, to the attention 
of the media to draw. 

134 
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:45,940 
There we have the right chimpanzee 
need. 

135 
00:08:46,341 --> 00:08:48,942 
We have someone like him if necessary. 

136 
00:08:49,206 --> 00:08:52,530 
A real hero. With dignity 
and nobility. 

137 
00:08:52,931 --> 00:08:55,007 
He has been dead thirty years. 

138 
00:08:55,008 --> 00:08:59,077 
But he does have a grandson. 

139 
00:09:15,978 --> 00:09:18,317 
What a pain. 

140 
00:09:18,318 --> 00:09:20,881 
When I was your grandfather had promised 
that I would fit on your ... 

141 
00:09:20,882 --> 00:09:24,038 
I had never thought that I every night 
'Mikado' would play with monkey bones. 

142 
00:09:24,138 --> 00:09:28,069 
What can I say, I am a doordouwer. 
I can do nothing but half. 

143 
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:31,916 
So if you steal the show continues, I 
you halfway opzetter animals. 

144 
00:09:31,917 --> 00:09:34,183 
You can not take him. 
He is mine. 

145 
00:09:34,184 --> 00:09:37,841 
Official government business. 
The national security ... 

146 
00:09:37,842 --> 00:09:41,441 
and a whole lot of other nonsense, where 
you do not want to make us their horns. 

147 
00:09:42,366 --> 00:09:44,391 
He is older than I had expected. 

148 
00:09:44,392 --> 00:09:46,155 
You're no spring chicken anymore. 

149 
00:09:47,821 --> 00:09:50,071 
And you're looking for ... 

150 
00:09:50,231 --> 00:09:53,907 
He is so cute. 

151 
00:09:53,908 --> 00:09:57,925 
I'm Dr. Smothers, and you 
goes to space. 

152 
00:09:57,926 --> 00:10:00,216 
Like your grandfather. 
- The space? 

153 
00:10:00,217 --> 00:10:03,351 
Wrong answer. You have the wrong 
Hamm, doctor. 

154 
00:10:03,352 --> 00:10:05,441 
Day lady from the area, 
who is attracted to me. 

155 
00:10:05,442 --> 00:10:08,347 
Good to see you. Take care, 
only at the door. 

156 
00:10:08,348 --> 00:10:12,113 
He seems very excited to go. 

157 
00:10:12,713 --> 00:10:15,860 
Child you throw away the only chance 
you have. 

158 
00:10:15,861 --> 00:10:19,753 
This is the chance to make up. 
To see your legacy to life. 

159 
00:10:19,754 --> 00:10:21,210 
I'm the star of my show. 

160 
00:10:21,211 --> 00:10:23,195 
Not as a work of art by one or other 
human astronaut. 

161 
00:10:23,295 --> 00:10:25,491 
Your grandfather was not one or 
other artwork. 

162 
00:10:25,591 --> 00:10:27,507 
He was a NASA astronaut. 

163 
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:30,469 
He was in magazines, newspapers, 
television ... 

164 
00:10:30,569 --> 00:10:32,908 
he has even met the president. 

165 
00:10:32,909 --> 00:10:35,065 
I have even met the chief of police. 

166 
00:10:36,672 --> 00:10:38,961 
He has done something to be proud of. 

167 
00:10:38,962 --> 00:10:40,856 
He had a dream and there is gone. 

168 
00:10:40,857 --> 00:10:43,872 
Did you dream? 
- I live my dream. 

169 
00:10:46,791 --> 00:10:48,609 
Houston, we have a problem. 

170 
00:10:50,684 --> 00:10:52,809 
Thank you your government supports. 

171 
00:10:52,810 --> 00:10:54,678 
I'm just before the court. 

172 
00:10:54,679 --> 00:10:58,562 
I want that back home. 

173 
00:11:00,584 --> 00:11:02,494 
It seems that we 
A new pill need. 

174 
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:05,154 
Keep you travel? 

175 
00:11:08,108 --> 00:11:10,580 
Here he comes. 
- Stand upright proud. 

176 
00:11:10,676 --> 00:11:13,857 
I can not believe we are going to fly 
with the grandson of the great Ham. 

177 
00:11:15,708 --> 00:11:17,621 
Are you sure this is the grandson? 

178 
00:11:18,170 --> 00:11:20,240 
I know my rights. I go 
the ASPCA 'call. 

179 
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:22,225 
I demand that my director of the circus 
get to speak. 

180 
00:11:22,226 --> 00:11:23,243 
Help, I'm kidnapped. 

181 
00:11:23,343 --> 00:11:26,874 
He is clearly excited to 
to a new environment. 

182 
00:11:27,925 --> 00:11:30,297 
Good glass. 

183 
00:11:31,277 --> 00:11:34,238 
Commander Titan, navigation 
and coordination. 

184 
00:11:34,239 --> 00:11:36,307 
Ham does not. 
And it may not care. 

185 
00:11:36,308 --> 00:11:39,272 
Lieutenant Luna, it's an honor. 

186 
00:11:42,807 --> 00:11:44,613 
Hello, ladies chimpanzee. 

187 
00:11:44,614 --> 00:11:49,366 
I hope you do not care, 
Luna means' Monday 'in Latin. 

188 
00:11:49,367 --> 00:11:51,073 
That's right, sir. 

189 
00:11:51,173 --> 00:11:53,201 
If you me. Two lovers of language. 

190 
00:11:53,301 --> 00:11:55,672 
The name is Comet. 
Computers and Electronics. 

191 
00:11:55,673 --> 00:11:58,592 
I am there to serve under you. 
- I am sorry kid, but I am not staying here. 

192 
00:11:58,593 --> 00:12:00,072 
I have to play Saturday for children. 

193 
00:12:00,073 --> 00:12:02,449 
Let's go, Houston. 
- With all due respect, sir ... 

194 
00:12:02,450 --> 00:12:05,112 
you are selected for a mission, 
of historic importance ... 

195 
00:12:05,212 --> 00:12:08,514 
and someone with great conviction ... 
- Yes, 'Land of the Free. Home of the Brave. " 

196 
00:12:08,614 --> 00:12:11,464 
Listen. The only mission that I have 
to entertain. 

197 
00:12:11,465 --> 00:12:13,281 
Watch and learn. 

198 
00:12:14,973 --> 00:12:17,008 
He is a joke. 

199 
00:12:18,624 --> 00:12:22,982 
Good luck. Success; inflammation, 
what you say. I gotta go. 

200 
00:12:27,752 --> 00:12:29,894 
What are they? 

201 
00:12:29,994 --> 00:12:33,067 
Space suits. We demonstrate that 
Saturday morning for the press. 

202 
00:12:35,315 --> 00:12:37,805 
My ticket home. 

203 
00:12:41,094 --> 00:12:45,382 
Flight from fear. 
Zartog Lord is near. 

204 
00:12:56,955 --> 00:12:59,465 
We are now aware of ... 

205 
00:12:59,466 --> 00:13:03,975 
the power of stupid, that I can call 
with my big shiny machine. 

206 
00:13:07,591 --> 00:13:11,156 
Is there anyone among you who are against 
My rule is? 

207 
00:13:11,256 --> 00:13:14,686 
So you say that you have the lead ... 

208 
00:13:14,687 --> 00:13:17,277 
because this thing has landed on your cabin? 

209 
00:13:17,278 --> 00:13:21,704 
Yes, and if you disobey me, 
I will be yours in the 'Fresnar' throw. 

210 
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:24,600 
That you do not. 
I will forever be frozen. 

211 
00:13:24,601 --> 00:13:27,519 
That's right. 

212 
00:13:40,822 --> 00:13:43,827 
Want someone else might 
just dive? 

213 
00:13:45,101 --> 00:13:48,105 
Well. Go all the work. 

214 
00:13:49,714 --> 00:13:54,423 
Let's start with this party. The "Infinity" 
has 10 Gs in the wormhole included. 

215 
00:13:54,424 --> 00:13:57,357 
If the internal pressure gravity 
can not resist ... 

216 
00:13:57,358 --> 00:14:00,172 
it will explode like a cup in 
the microwave. 

217 
00:14:00,173 --> 00:14:02,585 
Then their brains and their guts 
be crushed. 

218 
00:14:02,586 --> 00:14:05,106 
Your gravity works amazing. 

219 
00:14:05,107 --> 00:14:09,670 
Here comes force five. 
Here comes force six. 

220 
00:14:09,671 --> 00:14:12,166 
This thing goes so fast. 

221 
00:14:17,130 --> 00:14:19,954 
Seven G. 
Eight G. 

222 
00:14:22,094 --> 00:14:23,934 
This is perhaps a strange time 
to ask you ... 

223 
00:14:24,034 --> 00:14:26,523 
do you want me next week to help move? 

224 
00:14:26,524 --> 00:14:29,726 
I do not have much stuff, but 
we make it a fun day. 

225 
00:14:40,719 --> 00:14:43,076 
That was fun. 
Have you written? 

226 
00:14:43,077 --> 00:14:46,365 
My turn. 
- Poor little Comet ... 

227 
00:14:46,366 --> 00:14:47,940 
he thinks that he goes into space. 

228 
00:14:47,941 --> 00:14:50,566 
Three seats, three chimpanzees. 

229 
00:14:52,059 --> 00:14:53,646 
Where do we eat? 

230 
00:14:53,742 --> 00:14:55,424 
I eat no fat food. 

231 
00:14:55,425 --> 00:14:59,486 
We need you here, Comet. 
Our eyes and ears. 

232 
00:15:02,576 --> 00:15:04,722 
Child, I have you ever been the story 
told of ... 

233 
00:15:04,723 --> 00:15:07,942 
short circuit and planes 
the first Mercury rocket. 

234 
00:15:07,943 --> 00:15:10,880 
Was that you? 
- That was the day that his grandfather Ham ... 

235 
00:15:10,881 --> 00:15:14,533 
so easily went in the air, that 
a man could do. 

236 
00:15:14,534 --> 00:15:17,399 
I do not know what makes me happier ... 

237 
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:21,466 
Einstein's field theory, or to 
monkeys look on a treadmill. 

238 
00:15:31,954 --> 00:15:33,570 
What? 

239 
00:15:35,284 --> 00:15:39,134 
And to think I almost at Harvard 
left to start a software company. 

240 
00:15:39,135 --> 00:15:41,199 
Who's laughing now, Bill Gates? 

241 
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:44,908 
Order remember is a test 
for his chimpanzee brain capacity. 

242 
00:15:55,858 --> 00:15:58,357 
You want to jam? 

243 
00:16:10,096 --> 00:16:12,521 
When you gonna get right to 
, and fly well. 

244 
00:16:13,977 --> 00:16:16,197 
Saturday, for about ten hours. 

245 
00:16:16,198 --> 00:16:20,168 
I got these radios for the trip, I 
think that they can work through the wormhole. 

246 
00:16:20,169 --> 00:16:23,469 
Have you made? 
- I'm good with machines. 

247 
00:16:23,569 --> 00:16:26,115 
Listen kid, thank you for that banana 
but I did not need him. 

248 
00:16:26,116 --> 00:16:28,782 
I take the radio did. 

249 
00:16:30,373 --> 00:16:34,198 
Special Edition 'Simmion Space Shade. " 

250 
00:16:34,298 --> 00:16:37,388 
Thank you. Nice. 

251 
00:16:41,372 --> 00:16:42,920 
My fellow citizens. 

252 
00:16:42,921 --> 00:16:45,688 
This mission will be right by the cosmos 
go ... 

253 
00:16:45,689 --> 00:16:49,158 
where we finally answer 
the age-old questions hoping to get ... 

254 
00:16:49,159 --> 00:16:52,184 
there is intelligent life? 

255 
00:16:52,185 --> 00:16:54,210 
Check the steering of the rocket. 

256 
00:16:54,211 --> 00:16:57,067 
Judge Thumb is starting left thumb is stop. 
Up is right, down is left. 

257 
00:16:57,068 --> 00:16:59,825 
Judge Thumb is starting left thumb is stop. 

258 
00:16:59,826 --> 00:17:01,719 
Now you see it. Now you see it. 

259 
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:04,392 
Good. Here he is. 

260 
00:17:04,393 --> 00:17:07,734 
I had hidden. 
- You miss a schakeltje. 

261 
00:17:07,830 --> 00:17:10,182 
Come on, cannon ball. 
You are no longer with the circus. 

262 
00:17:10,183 --> 00:17:13,003 
This great leap by 
the wormhole to ... 

263 
00:17:13,004 --> 00:17:15,726 
involves much risk 
and danger. 

264 
00:17:15,727 --> 00:17:18,042 
Who will open this road for us? 

265 
00:17:18,043 --> 00:17:22,588 
The few, the proud, 
the monkeys. 

266 
00:17:31,543 --> 00:17:33,356 
Great. 

267 
00:17:33,357 --> 00:17:37,060 
A historic moment, and here he is ... 

268 
00:17:37,061 --> 00:17:40,243 
a symbol of our country and 
the greatness of our future ... 

269 
00:17:40,244 --> 00:17:43,341 
Ham III. 

270 
00:17:43,342 --> 00:17:44,703 
Thank you! 

271 
00:17:44,704 --> 00:17:50,338 
The circus, and beyond. 

272 
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,422 
That must hurt. 

273 
00:17:56,749 --> 00:17:59,351 
If he loses backpack. 

274 
00:18:01,636 --> 00:18:04,943 
Get out of the way. I am going on. 

275 
00:18:04,944 --> 00:18:06,902 
The game has become a chimpanzee. 

276 
00:18:08,644 --> 00:18:13,013 
Head up. 
- Run for your life, kids. 

277 
00:18:16,374 --> 00:18:18,381 
I'm on TV. 

278 
00:18:19,722 --> 00:18:22,312 
This is not good. 

279 
00:18:35,652 --> 00:18:37,624 
That is not good. 

280 
00:18:38,635 --> 00:18:41,070 
He is a joke. 

281 
00:18:50,544 --> 00:18:53,587 
Which way to the circus? 

282 
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:08,110 
Load them up. 

283 
00:19:16,572 --> 00:19:18,592 
What kind of simulator is this? 

284 
00:19:18,593 --> 00:19:22,320 
It looks very realistic off. 
- It is. 

285 
00:19:51,109 --> 00:19:53,250 
That I have thrown out. 

286 
00:19:55,036 --> 00:19:56,930 
Wait, just not. 

287 
00:20:03,684 --> 00:20:07,340 
Everything is good with me. 
Where are we now? 

288 
00:20:36,367 --> 00:20:39,564 
The simulator is getting smaller and smaller. 

289 
00:20:41,964 --> 00:20:44,238 
This is not a simulation, do you? 

290 
00:20:44,239 --> 00:20:46,944 
We are now officially "Space Chimps." 

291 
00:20:59,206 --> 00:21:02,165 
The 'Horizon', the first phase 
of the operation completed. 

292 
00:21:03,841 --> 00:21:05,628 
Great. 
- There they go. 

293 
00:21:05,728 --> 00:21:07,802 
Congratulations on ourselves. 

294 
00:21:26,690 --> 00:21:30,152 
That is too upright. 

295 
00:21:30,252 --> 00:21:32,485 
What a donkey. 

296 
00:21:32,486 --> 00:21:35,458 
You're doing it all wrong. 

297 
00:21:36,090 --> 00:21:38,215 
Move them higher. 

298 
00:21:38,216 --> 00:21:40,861 
Put them in a row. 

299 
00:21:40,862 --> 00:21:44,713 
Careful with that. 
It has cost me a day to throw. 

300 
00:21:44,876 --> 00:21:48,484 
Splork? 
- Yes, Lord Zartog.

301 
00:21:48,485 --> 00:21:51,767 
Kneel before Lord Zartog. 
- Yes, Lord Zartog. 

302 
00:21:51,768 --> 00:21:57,340 
Soon, the house of Zartog ready. 
It is great. 

303 
00:21:57,864 --> 00:22:00,121 
It is a shame that the volcano 
it will destroy ... 

304 
00:22:00,122 --> 00:22:02,060 
as the three suns in a row, 
on 'triple Sunday. " 

305 
00:22:02,061 --> 00:22:04,083 
I am a volcano that step. 

306 
00:22:04,084 --> 00:22:07,204 
I therefore construction. 

307 
00:22:07,205 --> 00:22:09,865 
These vibrations, the 'Fresnar' 
safe redirect. 

308 
00:22:09,866 --> 00:22:13,013 
Nothing will be the home of Zartog 
ever destroyed. 

309 
00:22:13,014 --> 00:22:16,829 
But if you 'Fresnar' 
of the volcano redirects ... 

310 
00:22:16,830 --> 00:22:19,058 
will be buried the entire village. 

311 
00:22:19,059 --> 00:22:23,080 
Exactly. An inglorious reflective pond, 
to my glory to reflect. 

312 
00:22:23,081 --> 00:22:25,895 
Resplendent. 
- Where should we all live? 

313 
00:22:25,896 --> 00:22:28,046 
With me, in my dungeon. 

314 
00:22:28,047 --> 00:22:30,835 
How nice of you, my Lord. 

315 
00:22:30,836 --> 00:22:34,195 
The logbook of the captain, 
begins now. 

316 
00:22:34,196 --> 00:22:37,427 
Space, the final frontier. 

317 
00:22:37,428 --> 00:22:41,248 
Do you have a pillow and blanket for me? 
- Stay in your chair. 

318 
00:22:41,249 --> 00:22:43,199 
That is a prescription. 
- I got brave ... 

319 
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,876 
Look, no hands, feet, 
no tail. 

320 
00:22:45,877 --> 00:22:49,657 
On earth would you disobedient behavior 
you bring the chimpanzee court. 

321 
00:22:49,658 --> 00:22:51,163 
That you do not go the whole journey do? 
- What? 

322 
00:22:51,164 --> 00:22:52,872 
Chimpanzee to use words 
to be replaced? 

323 
00:22:54,362 --> 00:22:56,299 
I'm going to murder him. 

324 
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:59,224 
Commander, violence is not allowed 
according to the Constitution of primates. 

325 
00:22:59,225 --> 00:23:00,836 
You're right, Lieutenant. 
- Is love permitted ... 

326 
00:23:00,837 --> 00:23:02,361 
according to the Constitution of primates? 

327 
00:23:03,151 --> 00:23:05,525 
Listen and learn, cannon ball. 
The approach sequence ... 

328 
00:23:05,526 --> 00:23:08,667 
should be activated. 
... Ignited engines 

329 
00:23:08,668 --> 00:23:10,364 
in the correct position and fast. 
The judge first ... 

330 
00:23:10,365 --> 00:23:15,488 
lower as the latest, meanwhile pressure 
365, if you want to stay alive. 

331 
00:23:15,489 --> 00:23:17,687 
Permission to speak, commander. 
- Allowed. 

332 
00:23:17,688 --> 00:23:19,882 
You're a dommerd. 
- I like you not. 

333 
00:23:19,883 --> 00:23:23,324 
Connect 3D Matrix. 
- Visual image is ready. 

334 
00:23:23,424 --> 00:23:24,764 
Fire 'Photon torpedoes' off. 

335 
00:23:24,765 --> 00:23:27,579 
It says' go 'on, cannon ball. 

336 
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:29,573 
Yes? Prove it. 

337 
00:23:29,625 --> 00:23:31,392 
Titan, do not. 

338 
00:23:31,393 --> 00:23:33,888 
Right at the mission. 

339 
00:23:33,890 --> 00:23:36,884 
I am sorry. 
How will we mention our children? 

340 
00:23:37,244 --> 00:23:40,094 
What? I go off. 
- You go countries. 

341 
00:23:40,095 --> 00:23:42,031 
Stabilizers, controlled. 

342 
00:23:42,032 --> 00:23:44,222 
Emergency propellers, monitored. 

343 
00:23:44,223 --> 00:23:46,147 
Collision detector checked. 

344 
00:23:46,148 --> 00:23:48,611 
Circus sample. 

345 
00:23:48,612 --> 00:23:51,706 
I can not 173 light years conventions. 

346 
00:23:51,707 --> 00:23:54,275 
I got you. 

347 
00:23:54,985 --> 00:23:57,507 
With the fur, bad George. 

348 
00:23:57,508 --> 00:23:59,521 
Disobey a crew member 
is caught. 

349 
00:23:59,522 --> 00:24:03,981 
And according to rule 815 ... 
- What is rule 815? 

350 
00:24:06,370 --> 00:24:09,775 
Guys, I have to pee. 

351 
00:24:11,819 --> 00:24:14,302 
If you have on suction. 

352 
00:24:14,303 --> 00:24:16,810 
We are indeed the toilet paper 
lost. 

353 
00:24:16,811 --> 00:24:18,752 
Not my fault. 

354 
00:24:19,652 --> 00:24:22,090 
And there is one rule for declaration. 

355 
00:24:22,825 --> 00:24:25,293 
I am pleased that we are not in that 
crazy-looking thing going. 

356 
00:24:25,294 --> 00:24:28,947 
Sorry if I'm on a mission, I 
only real astronauts heard. 

357 
00:24:28,948 --> 00:24:30,919 
Who told you then, 'Sorry'? 

358 
00:24:32,018 --> 00:24:34,342 
Someone else. 
- Why did you say than "someone else"? 

359 
00:24:35,344 --> 00:24:39,432 
Poop gym slip. 
- Maybe there is music on the radio. 

360 
00:24:46,387 --> 00:24:49,490 
Approaching different entrance. 
- We must have that threshold. 

361 
00:24:55,716 --> 00:24:59,059 
Approaching, 5G, 6G. 

362 
00:25:00,856 --> 00:25:02,916 
8G. 

363 
00:25:14,515 --> 00:25:16,685 
Come on. Where is this thing in reverse? 

364 
00:25:16,686 --> 00:25:18,985 
Welcome to The Star. 
- Thank God. 

365 
00:25:18,986 --> 00:25:21,339 
How can I help you? 

366 
00:25:36,906 --> 00:25:39,488 
The "Horizon" is the wormhole addressed. 
- Wonderful. 

367 
00:25:39,489 --> 00:25:41,798 
Did signal about 12 minutes and 
20 seconds needed. 

368 
00:25:41,799 --> 00:25:43,861 
This better work. 
- We have three chimpanzees ... 

369 
00:25:43,862 --> 00:25:47,025 
fastened in a spaceship 
of 3.7 trillion. What can go wrong? 

370 
00:25:51,379 --> 00:25:54,393 
Fun, a planet. 
We go there right away. 

371 
00:25:54,982 --> 00:25:57,501 
My God, we go there right away. 

372 
00:25:58,514 --> 00:26:01,358 
Wake up. 
You need this thing countries. 

373 
00:26:02,521 --> 00:26:04,621 
No reason for panic. You will only 
but through a wormhole ... 

374 
00:26:04,622 --> 00:26:07,030 
on the other side of the universe 
with nine thousand miles per hour ... 

375 
00:26:07,031 --> 00:26:09,418 
and no brakes. Come on. 

376 
00:26:10,292 --> 00:26:12,706 
Steering wheel? 

377 
00:26:13,690 --> 00:26:15,847 
Let one of these please 
are a force. 

378 
00:26:15,848 --> 00:26:18,062 
Please. 

379 
00:26:19,266 --> 00:26:21,622 
Airbags unfolded. 
- I did it. 

380 
00:26:21,623 --> 00:26:24,187 
I am the smartest chimpanzee 
of the universe. 

381 
00:26:48,091 --> 00:26:50,757 
That was not so bad. 
- Ship is stable. 

382 
00:27:03,966 --> 00:27:10,078 
Signal on, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. 

383 
00:27:12,974 --> 00:27:14,614 
Just wait, please. 

384 
00:27:15,060 --> 00:27:18,177 
I just go to 'Kinkoo's. 
If someone wants me to look at their list? 

385 
00:27:18,178 --> 00:27:22,608 
You lost the ship? 
- It must be a kind of technical problem. 

386 
00:27:22,708 --> 00:27:24,824 
Microwave popcorn to burn, 
is a technical problem. 

387 
00:27:24,825 --> 00:27:28,333 
This is a disaster of one trillion dollars. 

388 
00:27:28,334 --> 00:27:31,139 
3.7 to be exact. 
- Look at it from the sunny side. 

389 
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:33,876 
If they do not come back to save us 
5000 dollars to cake and balloons. 

390 
00:27:33,877 --> 00:27:37,389 
We can always count on the'24 hour 
failure / safety system. " 

391 
00:27:37,390 --> 00:27:39,278 
You have 24 hours to 
that chimpanzees back, or ... 

392 
00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:41,967 
I stop the funding, and make this 
space program to history. 

393 
00:27:41,968 --> 00:27:47,090 
I mean every penny. You can not yet 
once 'zakbeschermers' can buy. 

394 
00:27:48,515 --> 00:27:52,869 
Sample. 
- Remember, not dollars. Not Buck Rogers. 

395 
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:59,369 
I love Buck Rogers. 
- Who is Buck Rogers? 

396 
00:27:59,370 --> 00:28:02,422 
They have lost contact. 
Comet for Luna. 

397 
00:28:02,423 --> 00:28:04,321 
Answer me, Luna. 

398 
00:28:04,322 --> 00:28:07,114 
It must be a volcanic eruption to 
the surface of the sun. - What? 

399 
00:28:07,115 --> 00:28:09,247 
The central computer does not 
by the signal. 

400 
00:28:11,612 --> 00:28:14,777 
When I was younger, 
we just screamed louder. 

401 
00:28:16,095 --> 00:28:18,936 
Great, we landed at Barstow. 

402 
00:28:23,092 --> 00:28:26,344 
Take a look. Elephants are peanut chess. 
No, no. 

403 
00:28:26,444 --> 00:28:30,113 
The hall of the circus. The circus directors 
Hugo. Houston are bananas cabinet. 

404 
00:28:39,827 --> 00:28:42,449 
One small step for Ham ... 

405 
00:28:42,450 --> 00:28:45,559 
another small step for Ham ... 

406 
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:49,452 
and another small step. 
- What are you doing here? 

407 
00:28:51,413 --> 00:28:53,644 
Testing gravity. 
Yes, it works. 

408 
00:28:53,645 --> 00:28:55,539 
Who has given you permission 
in order to open the hatch? 

409 
00:28:55,540 --> 00:28:58,621 
Commander. 

410 
00:28:59,229 --> 00:29:01,001 
You are a risk for this mission. 

411 
00:29:01,447 --> 00:29:06,067 
A risk? I was sending when you and 
Commander Como were sleeping. 

412 
00:29:06,068 --> 00:29:09,768 
You stayed awake, and you have the landing gear 
not activated? 

413 
00:29:09,769 --> 00:29:11,911 
That you just had to do. 
- Not true. 

414 
00:29:11,912 --> 00:29:13,762 
I had my 'panic' 
to catch up. 

415 
00:29:13,763 --> 00:29:16,983 
Do not. 
- What? 

416 
00:29:16,984 --> 00:29:19,076 
The air may have been poisoned. 

417 
00:29:20,734 --> 00:29:23,763 
Poisoned air. 

418 
00:29:25,310 --> 00:29:27,506 
The log of the lieutenant ... 
- I stitching. 

419 
00:29:27,507 --> 00:29:29,234 
you can breathe the air. 
- I crave air. 

420 
00:29:29,235 --> 00:29:31,856 
The temperature is normal. 
- I'm dying. 

421 
00:29:33,498 --> 00:29:35,252 
Overwin the enemy of the day. 

422 
00:29:35,253 --> 00:29:38,546 
And there is no sign of intelligent life. 

423 
00:29:41,072 --> 00:29:43,607 
Look, the planet has three suns. 

424 
00:29:43,608 --> 00:29:47,491 
Amazing. Just as it is in 
a science fiction movie about another planet. 

425 
00:29:52,229 --> 00:29:56,321 
As you all know is tomorrow 
'triple Sunday. " 

426 
00:29:56,322 --> 00:30:01,133 
Our three suns together will be a 
and the volcano will explode. 

427 
00:30:01,276 --> 00:30:05,118 
In honor of this special day and 
More importantly, I do. 

428 
00:30:05,218 --> 00:30:08,314 
I give a party. A kind of 
'come to power' party. 

429 
00:30:08,315 --> 00:30:10,028 
Upper Lord. 
- What? 

430 
00:30:10,063 --> 00:30:11,768 
There is another metal beast 
from the air cases. 

431 
00:30:11,769 --> 00:30:14,287 
A metal beast? Like this? 

432 
00:30:14,288 --> 00:30:17,213 
Only bigger. 

433 
00:30:17,214 --> 00:30:20,286 
Bigger than mine? 
- It's not the size of the beast ... 

434 
00:30:20,287 --> 00:30:22,504 
what it does, because it is, my Lord. 

435 
00:30:22,981 --> 00:30:24,994 
Traitor. 
- I am not a traitor. 

436 
00:30:24,995 --> 00:30:27,648 
Take it back. 
- Well, I take it back. 

437 
00:30:27,649 --> 00:30:29,572 
You can not take back. 
You've said. 

438 
00:30:29,573 --> 00:30:32,027 
You have heard it all, right? 

439 
00:30:39,533 --> 00:30:41,910 
Me? 
- Congratulations, you are the leader. 

440 
00:30:41,911 --> 00:30:44,725 
Find a few soldiers at each other, 
and bring that beast from the air at me. 

441 
00:30:45,807 --> 00:30:48,990 
That guy with long red belly, 
that guy with the funny hat, and ... 

442 
00:30:48,991 --> 00:30:52,781 
who is behind them. 
- I will always be the last chosen. 

443 
00:30:52,889 --> 00:30:55,311 
Takeoff. 

444 
00:31:02,014 --> 00:31:04,441 
Take the 'Floofians. " 

445 
00:31:09,871 --> 00:31:14,251 
Imagine, we are the first astronauts 
who ever landed on this planet. 

446 
00:31:14,252 --> 00:31:16,679 
These photos will be front page news. 

447 
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:18,851 
The most important images of the century. 

448 
00:31:18,852 --> 00:31:20,829 
Can you take one of my good side? 

449 
00:31:20,830 --> 00:31:22,605 
Forget. All my sides are good. 

450 
00:31:22,606 --> 00:31:25,223 
Maybe take it as a heroic, 
with my chin like that. 

451 
00:31:25,224 --> 00:31:27,116 
And another, like this one. 

452 
00:31:27,117 --> 00:31:29,260 
Always alert. Brute. 

453 
00:31:29,261 --> 00:31:31,346 
Ready to attack. 

454 
00:31:31,347 --> 00:31:36,333 
Candid. I have been frank. 
I'm been naughty. 

455 
00:31:40,749 --> 00:31:42,953 
Wait, Luna. I would not 
do if I were you. 

456 
00:31:42,954 --> 00:31:46,075 
This is the first sign of life, 
on an alien planet. 

457 
00:31:46,175 --> 00:31:48,475 
Astronauts gather knowledge, 
that is what we do. 

458 
00:31:48,476 --> 00:31:51,065 
I would just be more cautious. 
- You, cautious? 

459 
00:31:51,066 --> 00:31:54,902 
I say only that this looks like 
a flower that 'Piddles "the clown used. 

460 
00:31:54,903 --> 00:31:58,387 
I must hear. 
- 'Piddles' is a really nice clown ... 

461 
00:31:58,388 --> 00:32:01,459 
which has a small fun box, 
covered with cute little flowers. 

462 
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:03,893 
The kids think this is the best 
thing is that they have ever seen. 

463 
00:32:03,894 --> 00:32:05,158 
Until ... 

464 
00:32:05,159 --> 00:32:07,494 
a giant snake comes out jumping. 

465 
00:32:07,495 --> 00:32:10,447 
Please, I am a trained astronaut. 
I know what I do. 

466 
00:32:10,448 --> 00:32:13,343 
Trained astronaut? 
'Space Chimps' are a joke. 

467 
00:32:13,344 --> 00:32:15,296 
If you think about your grandfather? 

468 
00:32:15,792 --> 00:32:18,307 
Picking your flower now, then we 
back to earth. 

469 
00:32:18,342 --> 00:32:22,076 
If there is no movement in the wormhole, I can 
the show of eight hours in the circus still out. 

470 
00:32:22,165 --> 00:32:26,150 
Nervous scientific 
book worm. 

471 
00:32:31,810 --> 00:32:33,602 
What does' Piddles' next? 

472 
00:32:33,636 --> 00:32:37,588 
He usually throws confetti in the audience and 
then throw pies in his face. 

473 
00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:42,435 
I do not think that will help us. 
- In my room manual ... 

474 
00:32:42,535 --> 00:32:44,493 
is there something solid, what we 
could do. 

475 
00:32:44,593 --> 00:32:48,058 
Alien capture, Alien uprising, 
Alien nothing about an investigation. 

476 
00:32:48,261 --> 00:32:50,757 
Manual is overwritten. 

477 
00:32:53,373 --> 00:32:56,059 
Confetti, I can not explain, 
it makes things just scared. 

478 
00:32:56,093 --> 00:32:59,044 
Are you sure they are not afraid 
for them. 

479 
00:33:00,617 --> 00:33:04,188 
I think that this sounds crazy, I think 
these guys are great. 

480 
00:33:04,767 --> 00:33:07,850 
Death to the foreigners. 
- Great name for a band. 

481 
00:33:10,135 --> 00:33:12,010 
Titan, wake up. 

482 
00:33:12,665 --> 00:33:16,014 
The beast is out of us. 
- Hurry, this way. 

483 
00:33:16,190 --> 00:33:20,409 
We can not leave the ship. Or Titan. 
- It seems that they leave us. 

484 
00:33:20,489 --> 00:33:23,261 
Return to Lord Zartog. 

485 
00:33:26,498 --> 00:33:29,621 
Grab them. Fire. 

486 
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:33,818 
You never had to leave the ship, 
it's all your fault. 

487 
00:33:33,918 --> 00:33:36,708 
I have not signed. 
I would now turn to the make up to sit ... 

488 
00:33:36,808 --> 00:33:38,715 
and not to sit on an extraterrestrial 
planet, and you must save. 

489 
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:43,388 
You, who saves me? I am the astronaut, 
you're just a publicity stunt. 

490 
00:33:46,344 --> 00:33:49,999 
You're really sunk low. 
- You've earned it. 

491 
00:33:50,099 --> 00:33:53,238 
No, I mean that you literally goes lower. 
We are at the sink. 

492 
00:33:53,378 --> 00:33:56,470 
I can not work out. 
- Come on. as we say in the circus ... 

493 
00:33:56,491 --> 00:33:58,855 
the show ends yet, until the woman 
with the beard has reached the coast. 

494 
00:33:59,009 --> 00:34:01,334 
It is just as disgusting as it sounds. 

495 
00:34:05,461 --> 00:34:07,733 
Climb on my shoulders and get that fixed. 

496 
00:34:12,129 --> 00:34:13,903 
Sorry, that's my leg. 

497 
00:34:15,261 --> 00:34:16,881 
They are in the swamp. 
- Val to. 

498 
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:20,955 
What now? 
- When the wind Slingeren. 

499 
00:34:21,055 --> 00:34:23,588 
Let your inner chimpanzee Friday. 

500 
00:34:23,623 --> 00:34:27,475 
Come on, Luna. As if you're on a trapeze. 
- I am not at the circus. 

501 
00:34:27,563 --> 00:34:30,413 
Life is a circus, Luna. 
Only the tents are better. 

502 
00:34:31,939 --> 00:34:34,685 
I come save you. 

503 
00:34:36,778 --> 00:34:40,762 
I can not. I'm going to fall. 

504 
00:34:40,862 --> 00:34:42,847 
You can do it, Luna. 

505 
00:34:42,881 --> 00:34:46,894 
I can not. 
- Use your shoulders, kick your legs ... 

506 
00:34:46,994 --> 00:34:52,038 
wave, and let go. 
- Shoulders, legs, swing, let go. 

507 
00:34:52,952 --> 00:34:56,333 
Shoulders, legs, swing, let go. 

508 
00:34:56,433 --> 00:35:00,637 
Good. 
- Shoulders, legs, swing, let go. 

509 
00:35:00,737 --> 00:35:05,707 
The chimpanzee is released. 
- Waving, let go. Look at this. 

510 
00:35:06,977 --> 00:35:09,837 
No. 

511 
00:35:12,083 --> 00:35:15,924 
There is nothing. Just a few monkeys 
by waving a jungle ... 

512 
00:35:16,024 --> 00:35:18,950 
with eyes and mouths. 
Eyes and mouths? 

513 
00:35:19,835 --> 00:35:22,346 
A snake, meet with hose two. 

514 
00:35:24,161 --> 00:35:27,145 
Grab him. 

515 
00:35:35,841 --> 00:35:37,965 
Time for a show. 

516 
00:35:38,668 --> 00:35:41,073 
Good afternoon, ladies. 

517 
00:35:44,438 --> 00:35:47,688 
What a first date, huh? 
- This is not a date. 

518 
00:35:47,699 --> 00:35:51,860 
That's it. And I hope you really 
another to see, because we ... 

519 
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:55,623 
will fall. 
- Ham, what do we do now? 

520 
00:35:55,923 --> 00:35:58,986 
Mik at the soft spot, do you 
arms wide apart ... 

521 
00:35:59,086 --> 00:36:02,123 
chin down, "thumb claw" 
inside. 

522 
00:36:02,223 --> 00:36:04,341 
I hope you know what you do. 
- Are you kidding? 

523 
00:36:04,441 --> 00:36:08,148 
I do this every day of the week. Except 
on Monday, that is my day off. 

524 
00:36:10,817 --> 00:36:13,320 
Luna, chin down. 

525 
00:36:23,264 --> 00:36:26,444 
Ham, everything is well with you? 

526 
00:36:26,689 --> 00:36:30,185 
Ham, get up. 
Come on, Ham. 

527 
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:33,159 
I am sorry that I was so hard against you. 

528 
00:36:33,259 --> 00:36:37,790 
Of course, you irresponsible, 
dangerous and undisciplined ... 

529 
00:36:38,339 --> 00:36:42,338 
but you saved my life, and you 
're a little funny ... 

530 
00:36:42,372 --> 00:36:44,649 
in an incredible way annoying. 

531 
00:36:44,684 --> 00:36:47,427 
And you were ... 
- Cute? - No. 

532 
00:36:47,527 --> 00:36:48,895 
Pretty? 
- No. 

533 
00:36:48,995 --> 00:36:50,910 
As Brad Pitt, but less than 
and with more hair? 

534 
00:36:51,010 --> 00:36:53,792 
What? 
- Luna, can you hear me? 

535 
00:36:53,803 --> 00:36:56,100 
Let me say one thing. 
- Luna lives. 

536 
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:59,673 
You're the most annoying, unpleasant, 
selfish creature that I've ever met. 

537 
00:36:59,807 --> 00:37:03,498 
Ham alive. 
- Luna, Ham, you hear me? Answer. 

538 
00:37:03,525 --> 00:37:06,342 
You are shameless. 
- We hear them, but they do not. 

539 
00:37:06,455 --> 00:37:08,553 
We need the Gregorian rate 
Customize ... 

540 
00:37:08,653 --> 00:37:11,435 
Helix move the mirror, 
and the staircase that goes around it crosses. 

541 
00:37:11,535 --> 00:37:14,149 
The only word that I verstond 
was' the '. 

542 
00:37:14,357 --> 00:37:17,668 
Mission log. We are stranded on 
a hostile alien planet. 

543 
00:37:17,701 --> 00:37:20,929 
Commander Titan is kidnapped. 
- And we are in love. 

544 
00:37:20,988 --> 00:37:23,848 
No, that we are not. 
Ignore that last part. Clear off. 

545 
00:37:23,881 --> 00:37:26,663 
Kidnapped? 
- Stranded? We have to go, kid. 

546 
00:37:26,747 --> 00:37:30,719 
We have only 22 hours before 
the autopilot is in force .. 

547 
00:37:30,819 --> 00:37:33,589 
and we stuck here forever. 
- What do you mean, stuck? 

548 
00:37:33,590 --> 00:37:35,813 
The ship has a built 
security to automatically ... 

549 
00:37:35,913 --> 00:37:39,976 
back to earth to fly 24 hours after 
we land. It was in your manual. 

550 
00:37:40,021 --> 00:37:43,987 
Was that before or after the chapter that 
a rescue fleet would save us? 

551 
00:37:44,022 --> 00:37:46,195 
Ham, but we have a chance at home 
to come. 

552 
00:37:46,228 --> 00:37:49,250 
I've had worse opportunities. 
Let's go. 

553 
00:37:59,527 --> 00:38:03,685 
'Sky Beast 2, the Sequil. " 

554 
00:38:03,686 --> 00:38:06,641 
Greetings, extraterrestrial beings. 

555 
00:38:08,187 --> 00:38:10,370 
Do not worry, you've 
I'm not wake up. 

556 
00:38:10,763 --> 00:38:14,358 
I was still standing. 
I'm commander, Titan. 

557 
00:38:14,492 --> 00:38:16,768 
I've traveled through space, 
Case for knowledge. 

558 
00:38:17,008 --> 00:38:19,335 
To the ends of the universe 
to investigate. 

559 
00:38:19,435 --> 00:38:22,352 
Voted for the first contact made 
with extraterrestrial beings like you. 

560 
00:38:22,452 --> 00:38:26,257 
Grab you and take you to 
my planet. In order to decompose. 

561 
00:38:26,357 --> 00:38:29,649 
Decompose? 
- We Then you lay down on ... 

562 
00:38:29,749 --> 00:38:32,832 
what with wax paper, cut you open 
with butter. 

563 
00:38:33,330 --> 00:38:38,640 
But first you must create a row, so 
I you can brands and cataloging. 

564 
00:38:40,279 --> 00:38:44,549 
Organism one, two, three. 

565 
00:38:44,626 --> 00:38:48,066 
I am Lord Zartog. 
Malgor ruler of the planet. 

566 
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:53,341 
Zartog? Have your birds as you mentioned? 
Because you are different. 

567 
00:38:53,441 --> 00:38:56,418 
I like you. 
With a 'g' or two? 

568 
00:38:56,881 --> 00:38:59,153 
I assume that this one is. 

569 
00:39:01,405 --> 00:39:06,182 
Number four, five. 
There are a lot of you. 

570 
00:39:06,664 --> 00:39:10,127 
Sir, this is the property of 
the space agency. 

571 
00:39:10,137 --> 00:39:12,875 
That is a direct violation 
of the interstellar protocol. 

572 
00:39:12,909 --> 00:39:17,556 
If you cooperate with me I will tribunal 
ask to see your soft tackle. 

573 
00:39:17,590 --> 00:39:20,292 
Work with you? 
I'm going to destroy you. 

574 
00:39:20,325 --> 00:39:24,587 
I appreciate your honesty, 
you're a good man, Zartig. 

575 
00:39:24,687 --> 00:39:27,092 
And a worthy opponent, 
Orphan pride. 

576 
00:39:27,192 --> 00:39:29,974 
Be prepared to forever 
to be frozen. 

577 
00:39:30,074 --> 00:39:34,537 
You do not even know how the tissue forming 
micro locomotor to use. 

578 
00:39:34,637 --> 00:39:37,220 
Even a freshman can do that. 

579 
00:39:40,483 --> 00:39:42,986 
Do you want me the secrets of the beast 
show? 

580 
00:39:43,448 --> 00:39:48,288 
Negative. You're not trained, 
not qualified, and not even insured. 

581 
00:39:48,292 --> 00:39:51,401 
Please. I do everything. 

582 
00:39:51,501 --> 00:39:53,071 
You can help me my crew 
to find. 

583 
00:39:53,209 --> 00:39:54,908 
Are there more? 
- Two others. 

584 
00:39:54,909 --> 00:39:57,232 
We are lost in the jungle 
of Gunglevick. 

585 
00:39:57,499 --> 00:39:59,497 
What idiot would go? 

586 
00:40:06,490 --> 00:40:11,245 
You gotta admit, to a strange 
alien planet, almost fun. 

587 
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:13,855 
My whole life I have dreamed of for 
a real astronaut to be ... 

588 
00:40:13,955 --> 00:40:16,470 
just like your grandfather. 
And here I am. 

589 
00:40:16,571 --> 00:40:18,920 
Real astronauts? 
Wake up, Luna ... 

590 
00:40:19,020 --> 00:40:21,418 
the only reason why we are here is to 
to see if we explode in space. 

591 
00:40:21,432 --> 00:40:24,040 
You got it wrong, 
we are real astronauts. 

592 
00:40:25,126 --> 00:40:27,155 
Is one of us lost our flashlight? 

593 
00:40:27,577 --> 00:40:30,809 
It moves very fast. 
Along rocks ... 

594 
00:40:30,853 --> 00:40:32,731 
and has a head? 

595 
00:40:33,227 --> 00:40:36,392 
Nice. 
- Please, I want you to do no harm. 

596 
00:40:36,575 --> 00:40:38,544 
Hello, I'm Lieutenant Luna. 

597 
00:40:38,641 --> 00:40:41,294 
I'm Hille Walle Wisa Seihua. 

598 
00:40:41,393 --> 00:40:42,916 
Great. It is drunk. 

599 
00:40:43,020 --> 00:40:46,797 
I am the last free from Lusian 
Kiloualawasahaui the village. 

600 
00:40:48,485 --> 00:40:50,610 
We come from the earth. 

601 
00:40:51,150 --> 00:40:55,043 
You know, the earth. ITunes, 
greenhouse effects, David Beckham ... 

602 
00:40:57,727 --> 00:41:00,023 
What is wrong with that 'glow in the dark' 
brainpan? 

603 
00:41:00,058 --> 00:41:02,013 
My head is light as I am afraid. 

604 
00:41:02,176 --> 00:41:04,698 
You need for us not to be afraid. 
We are your friends. 

605 
00:41:06,357 --> 00:41:08,287 
Friends. 

606 
00:41:15,629 --> 00:41:17,626 
Are you alone? 
- Yes ... 

607 
00:41:17,726 --> 00:41:20,600 
my village is captured 
by Zartog and a beast from the air ... 

608 
00:41:20,881 --> 00:41:24,537 
his metal claws gave him the power 
to make slaves on the planet. 

609 
00:41:24,803 --> 00:41:26,556 
Metal claws? 
The Roover. " 

610 
00:41:26,817 --> 00:41:30,372 
We were also the stars. 
- Yes, I see you crash. 

611 
00:41:30,522 --> 00:41:32,431 
Did you see that? 
That was me. 

612 
00:41:32,702 --> 00:41:35,513 
What? 
- Do you know where our ship is? 

613 
00:41:35,585 --> 00:41:37,819 
In the palace of Zartog. 
- Can you bring us go to that? 

614 
00:41:38,331 --> 00:41:41,583 
Do not worry. Us 
protect you, Killawallezalla ... 

615 
00:41:41,791 --> 00:41:47,369 
Let's say Kilowatt against her, otherwise 
we stand here all day. Or night. 

616 
00:41:47,655 --> 00:41:50,038 
We leave in the morning. 
The journey is dangerous. 

617 
00:41:50,138 --> 00:41:55,496 
We must reach the valley 
of very bad things go. 

618 
00:41:56,506 --> 00:41:59,461 
It is a country of unimaginable danger. 
torture pain and torture ... 

619 
00:41:59,742 --> 00:42:03,248 
not to mention alien flu, 
substance arches, flowers mad disease ... 

620 
00:42:03,283 --> 00:42:04,753 
the cave of the meat-consuming beast. 

621 
00:42:04,787 --> 00:42:09,450 
And the dark cloud of 'It' 
where none of escapes undamaged. 

622 
00:42:10,871 --> 00:42:13,865 
Sleep. You'll need your rest. 

623 
00:42:21,107 --> 00:42:24,355 
Stay on your side of the planet. 

624 
00:42:24,897 --> 00:42:27,832 
You have a rare earth 
way of love prove. 

625 
00:42:28,243 --> 00:42:30,004 
We have, or not? 

626 
00:42:30,601 --> 00:42:32,879 
Good night, sweetheart. 

627 
00:42:35,099 --> 00:42:36,926 
Wake up. 

628 
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:42,357 
That was refreshing. We have ... 
- Five seconds slept. 

629 
00:42:42,722 --> 00:42:46,327 
That's the benefit if you live in 
a planet with three suns. 

630 
00:42:46,765 --> 00:42:48,709 
Follow me. 

631 
00:42:50,057 --> 00:42:52,902 
Listen and learn. 

632 
00:42:53,172 --> 00:42:58,571 
The TR513I is a special vehicle, 
that is made to the area to investigate. 

633 
00:42:59,599 --> 00:43:02,374 
'Rocket and Ready "the designers, 
have equipped her ... 

634 
00:43:02,474 --> 00:43:05,382 
with a defense 
for every situation. 

635 
00:43:05,479 --> 00:43:09,210 
And the power station 
of 60 million kilowatts ... 

636 
00:43:09,310 --> 00:43:14,499 
ensures that it has enough energy 
until its work is done. 

637 
00:43:18,104 --> 00:43:21,128 
Ready to agree to run? 
- Just what I had in mind. 

638 
00:43:29,044 --> 00:43:32,502 
That wait is so mindless. 

639 
00:43:32,626 --> 00:43:35,707 
I really needed a Snickers, and you? 
- I'm allergic to peanuts. 

640 
00:43:43,892 --> 00:43:46,408 
This is even better than peanuts 
from the circus. 

641 
00:43:46,602 --> 00:43:49,673 
I still can not believe that 
the grandson of the great Ham is a clown. 

642 
00:43:49,897 --> 00:43:52,787 
I like what I do. 
- Would not you be a hero? 

643 
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:54,544 
You mean like a sandwich? 

644 
00:43:56,647 --> 00:43:59,172 
I wish I could welcome you 
called with fruit from our village, but ... 

645 
00:43:59,439 --> 00:44:02,222 
Zartog has destroyed all that. 

646 
00:44:03,736 --> 00:44:05,378 
We're sorry to hear that, Kilowatt. 

647 
00:44:05,478 --> 00:44:07,350 
Why would you build such a machine? 

648 
00:44:07,450 --> 00:44:09,323 
We have not done, but the people. 

649 
00:44:09,423 --> 00:44:13,929 
What are people? 
- They are just like us. For nearly 99.9%. 

650 
00:44:14,029 --> 00:44:17,005 
But it is 0.1% which makes 
that they all possess. 

651 
00:44:17,227 --> 00:44:19,127 
Do not. 
- But these are big sweets. 

652 
00:44:19,227 --> 00:44:22,000 
That is no food. 
That is a 'glophopper. " 

653 
00:44:31,801 --> 00:44:33,700 
Guys, I see this alone, 
or is that ... 

654 
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:36,564 
or is that a truly beautiful 
stack 'glophoppers'? 

655 
00:44:39,363 --> 00:44:41,130 
Just watch this again. 

656 
00:45:02,027 --> 00:45:04,174 
Why some form of life 
you would like to imitate ... 

657 
00:45:04,312 --> 00:45:06,867 
is one of the unsolved mysteries 
of the universe. 

658 
00:45:06,968 --> 00:45:09,924 
Grab the scissors. 
The rug itself is cut. 

659 
00:45:10,191 --> 00:45:12,171 
I have never danced before. 

660 
00:45:12,327 --> 00:45:15,675 
Well. Then we take baby steps. 
Give me your arm. 

661 
00:45:18,039 --> 00:45:21,164 
Please. Not so bad. 
You're a natural talent. 

662 
00:45:21,491 --> 00:45:23,787 
Am I? Really? 

663 
00:45:24,036 --> 00:45:25,926 
Take you kidding me? 
Absolutely. 

664 
00:45:28,596 --> 00:45:31,179 
I'm at the pops, 
and also to the conclusion ... 

665 
00:45:31,342 --> 00:45:33,706 
the next stop, robot. 

666 
00:45:35,007 --> 00:45:37,030 
Rumba spin. 

667 
00:45:37,496 --> 00:45:39,207 
We can better run away. 

668 
00:45:41,736 --> 00:45:43,813 
Ham, we can not run faster 
than theirs. 

669 
00:45:44,256 --> 00:45:46,148 
That is why I have this for those guys. 

670 
00:45:48,528 --> 00:45:50,497 
They call me for nothing 
'the Hamster'. 

671 
00:45:50,532 --> 00:45:53,930 
It is just like that my name is Ham. 
And I am really rolling. 

672 
00:45:54,341 --> 00:45:56,475 
And run. 

673 
00:46:14,305 --> 00:46:16,607 
We should really stop that 
still practicing. 

674 
00:46:17,132 --> 00:46:19,055 
Wait, not yet go away, 
sweets people. 

675 
00:46:19,155 --> 00:46:21,722 
You can really stop. 
- They are scared. 

676 
00:46:21,822 --> 00:46:24,693 
It is the cave 
the meat-consuming beast. 

677 
00:46:26,710 --> 00:46:28,584 
What is wrong with this planet? 

678 
00:46:28,871 --> 00:46:31,075 
You will die, if you have a cave 
with cute little chicks? 

679 
00:46:31,263 --> 00:46:33,285 
Ham, we have to finish this mission. 

680 
00:46:33,455 --> 00:46:35,703 
We have only twelve hours, 
before the ship departs. 

681 
00:46:35,904 --> 00:46:38,757 
By the cave. That is the only way 
to your ship. 

682 
00:46:39,784 --> 00:46:41,722 
Run. 
- Come on, Luna. 

683 
00:46:51,111 --> 00:46:53,815 
I want this party forever 
reminded ... 

684 
00:46:53,944 --> 00:46:56,660 
better than something that Malgor 
has ever seen. 

685 
00:46:56,769 --> 00:46:59,542 
Then you need serpentines. Nothing looks 
festive out there ... 

686 
00:46:59,642 --> 00:47:01,916 
than serpentines. I love it. 

687 
00:47:01,998 --> 00:47:04,983 
And then some more bags with goodies for 
if your guests leave. 

688 
00:47:05,135 --> 00:47:09,116 
It is a nice, simple way to 
to say 'thank you for coming. " 

689 
00:47:09,293 --> 00:47:11,610 
Splork, grab a pen. 

690 
00:47:12,452 --> 00:47:16,866 
Maybe we have luck, and devour 
that our beast meat only with his eyes. 

691 
00:47:25,467 --> 00:47:27,362 
We must find the exit. 

692 
00:47:33,972 --> 00:47:36,816 
This way. It's too narrow for him 
to come. 

693 
00:47:40,227 --> 00:47:42,488 
Faster. He pulls us. 

694 
00:47:44,533 --> 00:47:46,856 
It runs dead. 
- No. 

695 
00:47:54,236 --> 00:47:56,737 
Kilowatt, put yourself out. 
- Can not be afraid. 

696 
00:47:56,918 --> 00:47:58,933 
If we are not true, we are dead. 

697 
00:47:59,351 --> 00:48:01,939 
That does not help. 
- Here is a trick. 

698 
00:48:02,039 --> 00:48:04,158 
For your fear of restraint shall set you 
than where you are most afraid of. 

699 
00:48:04,339 --> 00:48:06,382 
And then imagine that you talk about wins. 

700 
00:48:10,245 --> 00:48:13,430 
Ham, it breaks loose. 
- Come on. You can do it, Kilowatt. 

701 
00:48:14,037 --> 00:48:16,027 
Be brave. 

702 
00:48:16,437 --> 00:48:19,019 
Keep your fear under control. 

703 
00:48:19,653 --> 00:48:23,642 
Keep your fear under control. 

704 
00:48:27,408 --> 00:48:30,747 
It works. 

705 
00:48:30,912 --> 00:48:33,067 
The output. 

706 
00:48:36,390 --> 00:48:38,184 
Let's go. 

707 
00:48:44,981 --> 00:48:47,518 
It blocks the exit. 
- We are in the fall. 

708 
00:48:47,851 --> 00:48:50,020 
I'm afraid my whole life ... 

709 
00:48:50,185 --> 00:48:52,704 
but you have shown me 
how I could get it under control. 

710 
00:48:52,766 --> 00:48:54,435 
Kilowatt, no. What are you doing? 

711 
00:48:54,528 --> 00:48:56,540 
What I should do. 

712 
00:49:06,678 --> 00:49:10,618 
If you devour me, I will only 
even stronger. 

713 
00:49:12,347 --> 00:49:15,501 
Kilowatt, no. 

714 
00:49:16,278 --> 00:49:18,148 
Why did she do that? 

715 
00:49:18,768 --> 00:49:21,412 
So stupid, and brave. 

716 
00:49:22,050 --> 00:49:24,228 
That was the most brave 
that I have ever seen. 

717 
00:49:25,362 --> 00:49:27,256 
Where are we? 

718 
00:49:29,512 --> 00:49:32,377 
This should be the dark cloud 
of 'It' are. 

719 
00:49:33,877 --> 00:49:37,652 
I feel weird and depressed by it. 

720 
00:49:37,974 --> 00:49:39,751 
I would not even be here. 

721 
00:49:39,939 --> 00:49:43,622 
I'm just a lousy circus monkey. 
- How do you feel there? 

722 
00:49:43,719 --> 00:49:46,484 
If a stupid animal trick. 
I'm just that. 

723 
00:49:46,671 --> 00:49:50,778 
A joke. I can replace 
by a cannon ball. 

724 
00:49:50,886 --> 00:49:55,068 
Crying and crying. 
They are trapped without oxygen. 

725 
00:49:55,126 --> 00:49:56,646 
Come on guy, we need their 
try to achieve. 

726 
00:49:56,873 --> 00:49:59,001 
I'm almost there. 

727 
00:49:59,159 --> 00:50:02,362 
I'm not even a good chimpanzee. 
I have not even once Houston thanks. 

728 
00:50:02,549 --> 00:50:05,522 
He is like a father to me. 

729 
00:50:06,236 --> 00:50:09,475 
I have my whole life in the shadow 
my famous grandfather lived. 

730 
00:50:10,769 --> 00:50:13,077 
How do you feel there? 

731 
00:50:13,412 --> 00:50:17,232 
You know how it is to 
the shadow to life? It is cold. 

732 
00:50:17,847 --> 00:50:21,802 
I knew I could never be a hero, 
So I was a clown. 

733 
00:50:22,700 --> 00:50:26,523 
I think you are broken through. 
I'm afraid that your time runs out. 

734 
00:50:29,693 --> 00:50:34,055 
There he goes then. With so much power 
told us they certainly did. 

735 
00:50:39,451 --> 00:50:41,398 
Dear Lord. 

736 
00:50:43,954 --> 00:50:46,752 
That there, that was just 
that cloud that was talking. 

737 
00:50:47,405 --> 00:50:51,357 
It is good. Sometimes a conflict between 
a super ego, and an 'It' ... 

738 
00:50:51,457 --> 00:50:54,686 
cast a long shadow 
in a soul. 

739 
00:50:54,955 --> 00:50:58,731 
I have no idea what you just said. 
I now walk this way. 

740 
00:51:00,887 --> 00:51:04,241 
Pathetic slaves of Malgore. 

741 
00:51:04,454 --> 00:51:08,682 
Welcome to the 'triple Sunday. " 

742 
00:51:10,907 --> 00:51:14,142 
Soon the sun will be on one line, 
and the volcano will explode ... 

743 
00:51:14,242 --> 00:51:16,832 
and a lot of you will 
not more than life. 

744 
00:51:18,587 --> 00:51:21,283 
That's your sign. 

745 
00:51:28,330 --> 00:51:31,583 
Now we do the party on my way. 

746 
00:51:37,192 --> 00:51:39,784 
Dance or you're thrown in there. 

747 
00:51:42,559 --> 00:51:43,937 
You. - Who? 

748 
00:51:44,049 --> 00:51:45,445 
You do not dance. 
- That I did. 

749 
00:51:45,545 --> 00:51:48,388 
No, that is more shuffle. 
- This is dancing. 

750 
00:51:48,488 --> 00:51:51,077 
Shuffle. 
- Dancing. 

751 
00:51:55,510 --> 00:51:58,227 
Shuffle. 
- Well, shuffle. 

752 
00:51:59,510 --> 00:52:02,586 
This is the third largest 
bad that I have ever seen. 

753 
00:52:02,819 --> 00:52:04,811 
And I've seen two. 

754 
00:52:04,850 --> 00:52:07,288 
That is the ship. 
- And there is the satellite. 

755 
00:52:07,388 --> 00:52:10,748 
Now it is my pleasure to 
the main atraktie to present ... 

756 
00:52:10,848 --> 00:52:14,118 
the monkey that has me the way out. 

757 
00:52:14,334 --> 00:52:18,585 
Here is Titan. 

758 
00:52:21,383 --> 00:52:22,918 
And he sleeps not. 

759 
00:52:23,087 --> 00:52:26,341 
If we had our missile deal, 
Titan, we could save. 

760 
00:52:28,376 --> 00:52:31,424 
Think you what I think? 
- We are not paid to think ... 

761 
00:52:31,524 --> 00:52:34,289 
we are not even paid. 
Think about it but once. 

762 
00:52:34,389 --> 00:52:37,244 
Wait. Chimpanzees have chimpanzees 
not behind. 

763 
00:52:38,382 --> 00:52:43,176 
Luna, I hear you. 
But I have to say. 

764 
00:52:43,473 --> 00:52:46,175 
We leave him here. 

765 
00:52:46,275 --> 00:52:48,196 
Well, we saved him. 

766 
00:52:48,296 --> 00:52:51,688 
Let it slowly discarding mechanism 
begin. 

767 
00:52:52,351 --> 00:52:55,816 
Zartig, now that I have you get to know you 
seems to me a reasonable alien ... 

768 
00:52:55,916 --> 00:52:59,302 
Therefore I offer you 
a pardon agreement. 

769 
00:52:59,402 --> 00:53:02,712 
No. 
- Let's go. 

770 
00:53:05,303 --> 00:53:06,625 
Here we go, ladies. 

771 
00:53:06,725 --> 00:53:11,610 
Go ahead. Throw me. But then you 
never learn how to use the 3D Radar. 

772 
00:53:12,725 --> 00:53:17,248 
The 3D Radar? 
- That's right. The 3D Radar. 

773 
00:53:17,560 --> 00:53:19,797 
Luna, follow me. 
- Roger. 

774 
00:53:19,897 --> 00:53:21,892 
Who is Roger? 
Is it serious? 

775 
00:53:22,612 --> 00:53:25,788 
Tell me, please. 

776 
00:53:27,198 --> 00:53:32,371 
Turn the star. Not too far, 
Radar to start. 

777 
00:53:33,985 --> 00:53:36,873 
You take the left, 
I take the right. 

778 
00:53:36,912 --> 00:53:39,734 
Alarm. Incoming chimpanzees. 

779 
00:53:43,050 --> 00:53:44,967 
But fire. 

780 
00:53:53,077 --> 00:53:55,207 
Luna, fun. 

781 
00:53:55,365 --> 00:53:58,445 
Let's go to the ship, 
so I can save you ... 

782 
00:53:58,545 --> 00:54:00,376 
and make sure we come home. 

783 
00:54:05,391 --> 00:54:09,044 
Where are the chimps go afterwards? 
- They have escaped. 

784 
00:54:09,396 --> 00:54:11,054 
Traitor. 

785 
00:54:16,954 --> 00:54:19,390 
Commander, the launch control 
not responding. 

786 
00:54:19,490 --> 00:54:21,484 
Check the diagnosis. 

787 
00:54:22,326 --> 00:54:24,571 
Nothing other than bells and whistles. 

788 
00:54:24,671 --> 00:54:27,256 
Why teach us all these things ... 

789 
00:54:27,418 --> 00:54:29,015 
as the steering 
not even connected. 

790 
00:54:29,115 --> 00:54:31,512 
I've already told you that this 
is all fake. 

791 
00:54:31,612 --> 00:54:34,745 
They wanted to know if our brains were working 
after we had gone through a wormhole. 

792 
00:54:34,845 --> 00:54:38,152 
We are canned ham. 
- And we could not even open the can. 

793 
00:54:38,471 --> 00:54:40,968 
Sorry, Luna. But we have nothing else 
than guinea pigs. 

794 
00:54:41,068 --> 00:54:44,469 
Actually, the guinea pigs 
on a mission to Mars. 

795 
00:54:46,493 --> 00:54:48,478 
The ship has all the time 
flown on automatic pilot. 

796 
00:54:48,578 --> 00:54:52,439 
We do not really self-governed. 
We were not real astronauts. 

797 
00:54:52,608 --> 00:54:55,187 
You have all the time right. 
- I did not want to have equal ... 

798 
00:54:55,287 --> 00:54:58,382 
that the way people think about us. 
That is not how we should think. 

799 
00:55:00,230 --> 00:55:02,458 
Why am I not born as a rabbit? 
Or a squirrel? 

800 
00:55:02,459 --> 00:55:04,229 
Or a major in 
art? 

801 
00:55:04,329 --> 00:55:06,678 
Nobody expects big things from them. 

802 
00:55:07,077 --> 00:55:08,878 
Another three minutes before takeoff. 

803 
00:55:09,161 --> 00:55:11,877 
We are at least safe and going home. 

804 
00:55:12,094 --> 00:55:16,855 
1600 "crunches" per day, 
five hundred times with each arm printing ... 

805 
00:55:27,345 --> 00:55:28,986 
I can not go. 
- What? 

806 
00:55:29,086 --> 00:55:31,181 
I know that we 'Probe' not 
built, but he came from the earth. 

807 
00:55:31,293 --> 00:55:33,378 
We have this to. 
I can not run away. 

808 
00:55:33,478 --> 00:55:35,476 
We owe it to be due Kilowatts 
and to this planet. 

809 
00:55:35,576 --> 00:55:37,780 
I have an oath, that I think this ship 
would bring to earth. 

810 
00:55:37,940 --> 00:55:39,569 
And that, I do. 

811 
00:55:44,008 --> 00:55:45,740 
Ham is right. 

812 
00:55:45,741 --> 00:55:49,456 
I prefer a hero here on Malgor, 
than a chimpanzee space on earth. 

813 
00:55:49,612 --> 00:55:52,502 
Lieutenant Luna, this is an order. 

814 
00:55:59,003 --> 00:56:01,743 
There goes our ride. 
- And Titan. 

815 
00:56:03,577 --> 00:56:05,554 
Commander. 
- And your oath then. 

816 
00:56:05,755 --> 00:56:07,961 
Chimpanzees do not chimpanzees behind. 

817 
00:56:08,075 --> 00:56:10,760 
You sir will make me cry. 

818 
00:56:10,795 --> 00:56:15,450 
Ham, we have a plan. 
- The commander of the mission consider a plan. 

819 
00:56:15,637 --> 00:56:17,558 
And your plan is? 

820 
00:56:17,658 --> 00:56:20,107 
Yes of course, the plan. 

821 
00:56:20,260 --> 00:56:23,848 
I am the commander of the plan, 
any plan whatsoever. It is my plan. 

822 
00:56:24,026 --> 00:56:25,514 
It is not your plan ... 

823 
00:56:26,911 --> 00:56:28,868 
Time to celebrate. 

824 
00:56:30,997 --> 00:56:32,601 
Horizon returns. 

825 
00:56:37,148 --> 00:56:40,333 
We have contact. 
The ship has come through the wormhole. 

826 
00:56:40,425 --> 00:56:42,208 
The landing is about fifteen seconds. 

827 
00:56:42,432 --> 00:56:45,767 
Here we go. History in the making. 
Turning to those cameras. 

828 
00:56:52,108 --> 00:56:53,450 
What ... 

829 
00:57:11,842 --> 00:57:15,044 
I'm afraid that the chimpanzees 
it does not have. 

830 
00:57:15,211 --> 00:57:17,519 
Do you? 
- That's enough. 

831 
00:57:17,619 --> 00:57:19,748 
The mission has been canceled. 
The space program has ended. 

832 
00:57:21,033 --> 00:57:22,869 
They remain stuck. 

833 
00:57:22,964 --> 00:57:24,727 
From tomorrow this whole agency ... 

834 
00:57:24,796 --> 00:57:27,450 
be converted into something useful ... 

835 
00:57:27,634 --> 00:57:31,669 
one of those places where your own 
signs designs, beschildert and bakes. 

836 
00:57:31,911 --> 00:57:34,384 
He has a point. 
That is useful. 

837 
00:57:34,478 --> 00:57:35,917 
And those two chimpanzees than 
who are still here? 

838 
00:57:36,056 --> 00:57:39,003 
Two chimpanzees, two words: 
'animals'. 

839 
00:57:39,173 --> 00:57:42,142 
We need to control the center. 
- We are their only chance. 

840 
00:57:44,876 --> 00:57:47,147 
Follow me. 
- Hold on. 

841 
00:57:47,922 --> 00:57:50,278 
For a chimpanzee from the twentieth century ... 

842 
00:57:50,378 --> 00:57:52,622 
you move very quickly 
to the twenty-first century. 

843 
00:58:01,650 --> 00:58:05,058 
Then maybe I'm old, 
but I'm aerodynamic. 

844 
00:58:05,721 --> 00:58:08,199 
You need to keep me, son. 

845 
00:58:17,827 --> 00:58:19,557 
Great plan. 

846 
00:58:19,657 --> 00:58:21,767 
Get ready to finally discarded 
to be. 

847 
00:58:22,191 --> 00:58:24,136 
Lieutenant Luna? 
- Yes, commander. 

848 
00:58:24,215 --> 00:58:27,189 
You had to plan Ham have questions. 

849 
00:58:27,190 --> 00:58:30,265 
Three chimpanzees, three codes. 
Who goes there first. 

850 
00:58:30,266 --> 00:58:32,284 
Are you? 

851 
00:58:32,861 --> 00:58:34,334 
The size. 

852 
00:58:34,434 --> 00:58:36,994 
Or are you? Those adorable. 

853 
00:58:37,283 --> 00:58:40,838 
Or all three at the same time? 

854 
00:58:40,839 --> 00:58:43,241 
As a commander I can at least 
for sure ... 

855 
00:58:43,322 --> 00:58:46,028 
that those bombs gym slip here 
you do not jump to throw. 

856 
00:58:47,278 --> 00:58:49,296 
How would you do that? 

857 
00:58:49,489 --> 00:58:54,486 
Because I you the secret of the 'Roover' are 
universal domination will learn. 

858 
00:58:54,583 --> 00:58:56,312 
The whole universe? 

859 
00:58:56,505 --> 00:58:58,139 
It is big, right? 

860 
00:58:58,140 --> 00:58:59,773 
But first let go of my crew. 

861 
00:58:59,870 --> 00:59:01,833 
What? 
- Tell me. 

862 
00:59:05,060 --> 00:59:07,397 
What does he. 
- Tell me, please. 

863 
00:59:07,497 --> 00:59:08,905 
Then I let you live. 

864 
00:59:08,906 --> 00:59:12,557 
In order to dominate the universe, press 
first on the yellow button. 

865 
00:59:12,558 --> 00:59:15,260 
Turn the blue button, 
and then the green. 

866 
00:59:16,580 --> 00:59:18,901 
And move the lever into reverse. 

867 
00:59:19,767 --> 00:59:22,212 
This one? 
- That's right. 

868 
00:59:26,948 --> 00:59:29,688 
You guys are really stupid. 
- Yes. 

869 
00:59:29,956 --> 00:59:31,743 
And a very bad poet. 

870 
00:59:38,797 --> 00:59:42,053 
I said 'backwards'? 

871 
00:59:42,835 --> 00:59:44,712 
That was a joke. 

872 
00:59:54,462 --> 00:59:56,046 
Kilowatt, you alive. 
- But how? 

873 
00:59:56,146 --> 00:59:58,979 
We saw that the flesh-consuming beast 
you swallowed by. 

874 
00:59:59,461 --> 01:00:00,902 
He was not yet begun to chew. 

875 
01:00:02,056 --> 01:00:04,072 
How did you come from there? 

876 
01:00:08,767 --> 01:00:10,512 
Let me not go back. 

877 
01:00:11,474 --> 01:00:13,962 
What? 
- Have you made a grab? 

878 
01:00:16,445 --> 01:00:19,758 
Someone wants the statue of Zartog? 
- I take it. 

879 
01:00:25,757 --> 01:00:28,808 
You have freed us from 
the tires of slavery. 

880 
01:00:28,908 --> 01:00:32,077 
We are eternally grateful to you. 
We are you owed our lives. 

881 
01:00:32,219 --> 01:00:34,051 
We have come. 
- We have crashed. 

882 
01:00:34,639 --> 01:00:37,040 
We got him a kick up 
given his ass. 

883 
01:00:37,618 --> 01:00:40,323 
What? Why had his ass do that? 

884 
01:00:40,597 --> 01:00:43,804 
That is a saying. That is that. 
- That is not how it goes. 

885 
01:00:44,058 --> 01:00:47,987 
I'm 99.9% sure that 
it goes. 

886 
01:00:48,094 --> 01:00:50,232 
You show your love earth 
in a weird way. 

887 
01:00:50,267 --> 01:00:52,419 
Luna, can you hear me? 

888 
01:00:52,708 --> 01:00:54,726 
Luna, is that a banana in your pocket? 

889 
01:00:55,303 --> 01:00:57,411 
Would you develop? 

890 
01:00:59,632 --> 01:01:01,201 
Comet? Thank God. 

891 
01:01:01,266 --> 01:01:03,974 
You will never believe what happened. 
- We have all heard. 

892 
01:01:04,151 --> 01:01:06,895 
We have heard you the whole time. 
- The whole time? 

893 
01:01:07,112 --> 01:01:09,629 
Yes, all the time, son. 

894 
01:01:09,726 --> 01:01:11,892 
I am sorry that I have so called 
that your legacy would comply. 

895 
01:01:11,992 --> 01:01:14,870 
It is good, Houston. 
Maybe it's time that I do. 

896 
01:01:14,970 --> 01:01:17,010 
What is your status? 
- Unmarried. 

897 
01:01:17,114 --> 01:01:19,243 
But there is someone I 
my view to have been dropped. 

898 
01:01:19,900 --> 01:01:21,931 
It is Luna. 
In the event that you you wonder. 

899 
01:01:22,833 --> 01:01:25,966 
We discussed the status of the mission? 
- Yes. 

900 
01:01:26,105 --> 01:01:28,282 
Everything is good, but we have nothing 
where we can leave. 

901 
01:01:28,589 --> 01:01:30,906 
You have the 'Probe' still? 
- The 'Probe'? 

902 
01:01:30,999 --> 01:01:32,664 
That is not designed for it 
back to earth to go. 

903 
01:01:32,764 --> 01:01:34,338 
We should just 'chimproviseren. " 

904 
01:01:34,438 --> 01:01:37,419 
I got your stupid word games 
a little missed - Thank you. 

905 
01:01:37,519 --> 01:01:39,917 
Titan is right. 
You have a whole new design is needed. 

906 
01:01:40,017 --> 01:01:41,495 
How do we do that? 

907 
01:01:41,591 --> 01:01:43,151 
I give you as Comet. 

908 
01:01:43,152 --> 01:01:46,404 
When we first need the aerodynamic 
skeletal structure redesign. 

909 
01:01:46,504 --> 01:01:48,161 
Understood. Let me give you just Luna. 

910 
01:01:48,339 --> 01:01:50,649 
Go ahead, Comet. 
- Secondly, you need coolant. 

911 
01:01:50,749 --> 01:01:54,212 
We have at least 7.7 million pounds 
coolant needed ... 

912 
01:01:54,312 --> 01:01:56,319 
to ensure that we escape 
from the gravity of the planet. 

913 
01:01:56,366 --> 01:01:58,932 
That never succeed without a 
two-stage rocket. 

914 
01:01:58,967 --> 01:02:00,825 
We can not do. 

915 
01:02:00,860 --> 01:02:04,467 
Even if we could build a ship, 
it would never get rid of this planet. 

916 
01:02:09,175 --> 01:02:11,394 
If you are a chimpanzee from a cannon may 
shoot ... 

917 
01:02:11,494 --> 01:02:13,004 
you can also a chimpanzee 
shoot from a volcano. 

918 
01:02:13,567 --> 01:02:17,006 
Of course. Geothermal energy. 

919 
01:02:17,222 --> 01:02:18,913 
We do not have much time. 

920 
01:02:19,014 --> 01:02:20,936 
Kilowatt, we will need some help 
if we ever want to come home. 

921 
01:02:21,036 --> 01:02:24,962 
Malgor planet at your service. 
- Let's ride 'chimp. " 

922 
01:02:25,959 --> 01:02:29,974 
I know I have the pun 
missed, but that was not acceptable. 

923 
01:02:34,506 --> 01:02:38,428 
I am ready and waiting for instructions. 
- I need water tape. Now. 

924 
01:02:38,837 --> 01:02:41,776 
There, that's right. 

925 
01:02:44,131 --> 01:02:46,167 
We must go quickly. 

926 
01:03:36,899 --> 01:03:41,770 
Kilowatt, we will never forget you. 
- I never you. 

927 
01:03:42,107 --> 01:03:44,774 
They will no beauty contest 
win, but they will fly. 

928 
01:03:44,875 --> 01:03:46,756 
Probably. - Maybe. 
- Hopefully. 

929 
01:03:48,044 --> 01:03:50,461 
Let's not be too much 
analyze. 

930 
01:03:50,639 --> 01:03:53,595 
The sun in a row, you should hurry. 
The volcano will erupt. 

931 
01:03:53,926 --> 01:03:56,271 
And then the new entrance? 

932 
01:03:56,371 --> 01:03:58,828 
You have a nose cone needed. 
- Nose Cone? 

933 
01:03:59,055 --> 01:04:01,328 
No time. How should we 
build a nose cone? 

934 
01:04:06,922 --> 01:04:09,240 
Control center, the Infinity 
will launch. 

935 
01:04:09,340 --> 01:04:11,274 
Five seconds. 
- I can not see. 

936 
01:04:11,374 --> 01:04:13,653 
It is louder than a gun. 
- I think I become sick. 

937 
01:04:49,093 --> 01:04:51,411 
We have the Fresnar stopped. 

938 
01:04:54,822 --> 01:04:56,597 
Time to go home. 

939 
01:04:58,185 --> 01:05:00,347 
Goodbye. 

940 
01:05:06,728 --> 01:05:11,497 
I can already see the headlines: 
'Commander Titan returns to earth. " 

941 
01:05:11,597 --> 01:05:14,421 
What will I wear? 
What fits on confetti? 

942 
01:05:17,978 --> 01:05:19,960 
We are approaching the entrance of the wormhole. 
- Here it comes. 

943 
01:05:20,060 --> 01:05:22,420 
Take this. 
- But I do not know how. 

944 
01:05:22,442 --> 01:05:24,847 
If we need you fainting 
our home. 

945 
01:05:25,089 --> 01:05:26,914 
Are you crazy? 
I'm no astronaut. 

946 
01:05:26,915 --> 01:05:29,374 
Wear clothing you astronauts? 
- Yes. 

947 
01:05:29,538 --> 01:05:31,430 
Are you in a missile? 
- Yes. 

948 
01:05:31,431 --> 01:05:33,063 
In space? 
- Yes. 

949 
01:05:33,064 --> 01:05:36,013 
Are you David Bowie? 
- No. 

950 
01:05:36,113 --> 01:05:37,578 
Then you are an astronaut. 

951 
01:05:37,678 --> 01:05:40,481 
Bring the bird home, smart guy. 

952 
01:05:48,421 --> 01:05:50,156 
I'm not here for. 

953 
01:05:51,895 --> 01:05:54,490 
I believe in you. 

954 
01:05:54,874 --> 01:05:57,134 
Luna Wait, no. 

955 
01:06:18,971 --> 01:06:21,393 
Believe in yourself, Ham. 

956 
01:06:22,162 --> 01:06:25,323 
Grandpa Ham, I can not do this. 
I'm not you. 

957 
01:06:25,423 --> 01:06:29,962 
Of course you are not me. 
You are yourself. You can do things, son. 

958 
01:06:30,062 --> 01:06:33,115 
Put them on your way. 

959 
01:06:38,864 --> 01:06:41,234 
That they are. They are from the wormhole. 

960 
01:06:41,235 --> 01:06:44,988 
Infinity, welcome back. 
Ham, you receive me? 

961 
01:06:44,995 --> 01:06:46,913 
The children were sleeping. 

962 
01:06:46,922 --> 01:06:49,511 
Ham, you should straighten your ship 
to come. 

963 
01:06:49,512 --> 01:06:53,563 
You come too fast inside. You must 
adjust your angle of 33 degrees. 

964 
01:06:53,869 --> 01:06:55,769 
Exactly 33 degrees. 

965 
01:06:55,791 --> 01:06:58,726 
Just a bit. 
Or precisely, exactly? 

966 
01:06:58,727 --> 01:07:03,321 
Exactly, exactly. If you input 
not touched, you will be space dust. 

967 
01:07:03,477 --> 01:07:05,831 
Activate the electrical power. 
- Checked. 

968 
01:07:05,832 --> 01:07:08,393 
Put the 'turbulence impetus' to. 
- Checked. 

969 
01:07:08,484 --> 01:07:12,314 
Set off the heat reflectors. 
And the move to gyroscopische stabilatoren. 

970 
01:07:12,605 --> 01:07:15,641 
I can not here. 

971 
01:07:16,641 --> 01:07:18,317 
Ham, you are going to run. 

972 
01:07:21,733 --> 01:07:23,775 
Completely lost control. 

973 
01:07:23,780 --> 01:07:26,066 
Do you need a copilot? 
- Lieutenant Luna. 

974 
01:07:26,153 --> 01:07:28,001 
Which I certainly needed. 

975 
01:07:29,035 --> 01:07:32,490 
Control Center, we appreciate 
our angle of 33 degrees at. 

976 
01:07:32,841 --> 01:07:34,853 
Yes. 
- Good grace. 

977 
01:07:38,067 --> 01:07:40,470 
We have done it. 
Gordo, we can see it. 

978 
01:07:40,839 --> 01:07:42,737 
And Commander Coma, we will 
make him awake? 

979 
01:07:42,738 --> 01:07:44,577 
We have no third wheel 
We need a date. 

980 
01:07:44,793 --> 01:07:48,512 
Luna, leave the landing gear down. 
- Checked. 

981 
01:07:49,789 --> 01:07:52,230 
Houston, our landing gear is broken. 

982 
01:07:52,576 --> 01:07:55,766 
I picked a bad week, 
to stop eating bananas. 

983 
01:07:55,767 --> 01:07:57,409 
And now? 
- Do not worry, son. 

984 
01:07:57,410 --> 01:07:59,878 
Low technology solutions 
are my specialty. 

985 
01:07:59,879 --> 01:08:02,238 
Ham, you remember the circus? 

986 
01:08:02,239 --> 01:08:04,839 
Well. You will crash. 
- Are we going to crash? 

987 
01:08:05,115 --> 01:08:08,319 
But this time directed you to your goal. 
- Roger, Houston. 

988 
01:08:08,526 --> 01:08:10,937 
Why you laugh, if we go crash? 

989 
01:08:10,938 --> 01:08:13,618 
Because crash which is 
what the best I can. 

990 
01:08:17,538 --> 01:08:19,585 
Come out with your feet up. 

991 
01:08:19,586 --> 01:08:22,289 
Legs? They are chimpanzees. 
They have hands. 

992 
01:08:22,290 --> 01:08:25,124 
With a thumb like a claw. 
- Come out with your thumbs up. 

993 
01:08:25,125 --> 01:08:27,214 
They mean no English. 

994 
01:08:31,393 --> 01:08:33,404 
Trap it. 

995 
01:08:37,239 --> 01:08:41,170 
My Wig. 
- That we all knew. 

996 
01:08:41,482 --> 01:08:43,029 
Everyone knew it. 

997 
01:08:43,030 --> 01:08:46,959 
Everyone knew it, when you did not swim 
at the party office. 

998 
01:08:49,722 --> 01:08:51,821 
We go. 

999 
01:08:57,816 --> 01:08:59,882 
What was that? 

1000 
01:09:01,204 --> 01:09:04,181 
I can not keep. 
We have lost the steering. 

1001 
01:09:10,307 --> 01:09:12,750 
Link. 

1002 
01:09:13,670 --> 01:09:16,531 
I said, 'link'. 
- You got it. 

1003 
01:09:22,498 --> 01:09:25,964 
I had never thought that I would say, 
but you leave the ship crash. 

1004 
01:09:26,833 --> 01:09:29,516 
What you gonna do? 
No Luna, do not. 

1005 
01:09:29,607 --> 01:09:32,103 
I see you on the ground. 

1006 
01:09:32,567 --> 01:09:35,817 
Now we have closed the chapter, 
about space travel ... 

1007 
01:09:35,818 --> 01:09:41,246 
we have opened a new chapter in 
the history of your own sign painting. 

1008 
01:09:48,809 --> 01:09:51,238 
Just a little further. 

1009 
01:09:57,660 --> 01:09:59,982 
You've done it. 
I got him back under control. 

1010 
01:10:03,910 --> 01:10:06,999 
The national space program 
is here to ... 

1011 
01:10:55,422 --> 01:10:58,690 
Luna, get up. 
Everything is good with you? 

1012 
01:11:01,225 --> 01:11:04,226 
This can not happen. 
Come on, Luna. 

1013 
01:11:04,646 --> 01:11:07,312 
I was this time focused on the goal. 

1014 
01:11:08,311 --> 01:11:10,426 
I tried to get more 
you seem to. 

1015 
01:11:10,507 --> 01:11:12,376 
You always had ... 

1016 
01:11:12,883 --> 01:11:15,217 
Right? 
- Yes, and you made me me ... 

1017 
01:11:15,504 --> 01:11:16,786 
Feel better? 
- Yes. 

1018 
01:11:17,372 --> 01:11:18,940 
And if I should carry on without you ... 

1019 
01:11:19,040 --> 01:11:21,299 
That you do not. 

1020 
01:11:23,751 --> 01:11:25,361 
How did you survive? 

1021 
01:11:25,362 --> 01:11:27,610 
Chin down. 
Thumb as a claw, inside. 

1022 
01:11:27,611 --> 01:11:30,833 
Lieutenant Luna, you're in style 
crashed. 

1023 
01:11:30,934 --> 01:11:33,759 
Cannon ball, I was wrong about you. 

1024 
01:11:33,855 --> 01:11:35,603 
You would have made your grandfather proud. 

1025 
01:11:35,703 --> 01:11:39,337 
Thank you. I think I have a chimpanzee 
'm from the old sex. 

1026 
01:11:39,338 --> 01:11:42,752 
That is a good one. 
That should I even use it. 

1027 
01:11:42,944 --> 01:11:47,115 
You've done that countries well. 
I knew you had it in you. 

1028 
01:11:47,116 --> 01:11:49,925 
What can I say, 
I am a doordouwer. 

1029 
01:11:49,926 --> 01:11:52,399 
Official Area Commander sunglasses. 

1030 
01:11:52,400 --> 01:11:54,657 
And here is your banana phone back. 

1031 
01:11:54,705 --> 01:11:56,949 
It was almost as good as 
that you had been with us. 

1032 
01:12:01,315 --> 01:12:03,026 
The Infinity? 

1033 
01:12:03,027 --> 01:12:04,550 
How? 
- Impossible. 

1034 
01:12:04,650 --> 01:12:06,920 
This ship was not designed 
to return. 

1035 
01:12:07,020 --> 01:12:08,808 
It is not even a ship. 
- It is a miracle. 

1036 
01:12:09,166 --> 01:12:11,367 
A major scientific achievement. 

1037 
01:12:11,467 --> 01:12:13,761 
But who has built it? 

1038 
01:12:30,244 --> 01:12:32,638 
We should perhaps I.Q. 
re-testing of the chimpanzees. 

1039 
01:12:32,738 --> 01:12:34,626 
Would you say that the chimpanzees 
have built this ship? 

1040 
01:12:34,726 --> 01:12:36,485 
We may never know 
who has built this ... 

1041 
01:12:36,585 --> 01:12:38,237 
but they are brought home. 

1042 
01:12:38,649 --> 01:12:40,325 
Senator. 

1043 
01:12:40,326 --> 01:12:43,093 
Would you close the space agency? 

1044 
01:12:44,957 --> 01:12:46,388 
I ... 

1045 
01:12:48,121 --> 01:12:52,576 
I want to announce the opening of 
a highly technical area ... 

1046 
01:12:52,577 --> 01:12:55,761 
dedicated to the research 
of space. 

1047 
01:12:55,917 --> 01:12:59,465 
With first class facilities for 
chimpanzees, and ... 

1048 
01:12:59,946 --> 01:13:04,231 
and a do-it-yourself 'sunday bar. " 

1049 
01:13:04,730 --> 01:13:10,073 
And personal 'zakbeschermers' 
for everyone. 

1050 
01:13:17,167 --> 01:13:20,027 
Do chimpanzees 
extraterrestrial life meet? 

1051 
01:13:22,062 --> 01:13:25,830 
We will have another mission 
be sure to get to know. 

1052 
01:13:25,888 --> 01:13:27,220 
Ready, Luna? 
- Ready, Captain. 

1053 
01:13:27,320 --> 01:13:30,337 
Big Boy? 
- Ready-born pill. 

1054 
01:13:31,637 --> 01:13:34,535 
Confetti, I love it. 

1055 
01:13:35,676 --> 01:13:43,977 
Fearless Teq Underground! B a r e w e! For The 
Unstoppable - Unbelievable - Unbeatable-Union
