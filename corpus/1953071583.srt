1
00:02:09,562 --> 00:02:10,859
Excellent!

2
00:02:13,566 --> 00:02:14,658
Full marks!

3
00:02:23,877 --> 00:02:25,674
Hello.

4
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:28,572
The three of you watch carefully now.

5
00:02:28,648 --> 00:02:31,879
Don't blame me for never cooking
these past 30 years.

6
00:02:32,252 --> 00:02:35,278
Blame your father.
He was such a great chef!

7
00:02:35,355 --> 00:02:38,415
-She cooks?!
-For keeping me out of the kitchen.

8
00:02:40,126 --> 00:02:41,559
Look.

9
00:02:41,628 --> 00:02:47,123
This... and that...
and those are all prepared by me.

10
00:02:47,233 --> 00:02:50,828
Your mom didn't order any take-out.

11
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:56,372
Do bless this meal, old man!

12
00:02:56,509 --> 00:02:59,876
True happiness is in fact quite simple.

13
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:04,048
When I was away, knowing that
your father was also thinking of me...

14
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:05,845
That's true happiness!

15
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:09,750
So, my three silly girls,

16
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:13,123
get out there and find your true happiness.

17
00:03:17,597 --> 00:03:20,293
No matter where you are in the world...

18
00:03:20,366 --> 00:03:21,765
No...

19
00:03:22,368 --> 00:03:26,304
I should say,
no matter which planet you are on.

20
00:03:26,406 --> 00:03:29,603
Mom will always be thinking of you!

21
00:03:29,776 --> 00:03:32,301
I miss you, my babies!

22
00:03:32,378 --> 00:03:33,743
I miss you too, Mom!

23
00:03:53,132 --> 00:03:56,295
First day, first meal, right on time!

24
00:03:56,936 --> 00:03:57,960
Bon appetit!

25
00:03:59,138 --> 00:04:01,129
The lss Command Center has advanced

26
00:04:01,207 --> 00:04:03,801
tomorrow's satellite launch to 08:30.

27
00:04:03,977 --> 00:04:05,205
We have to revise our rundown.

28
00:04:05,311 --> 00:04:06,835
Disruption test at 20:10.

29
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:09,006
21:10 clean up, you'll have only 20 minutes

30
00:04:09,148 --> 00:04:10,547
You'll adjust the solar panels
90 degrees by 21:30...

31
00:04:10,617 --> 00:04:14,109
You know, one in five astronauts

32
00:04:14,654 --> 00:04:17,714
has a strong reaction
to their first meal in space.

33
00:04:21,427 --> 00:04:22,917
We should focus on eating.

34
00:04:23,463 --> 00:04:27,194
Correction: It's one in 6.35 astronauts.

35
00:04:27,634 --> 00:04:30,228
Your information may not be reliable.

36
00:04:30,737 --> 00:04:32,568
Needs empirical knowledge.

37
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:44,344
I hear you broke up again?

38
00:04:49,022 --> 00:04:50,580
You don't have to be so nervous!

39
00:04:53,159 --> 00:04:55,218
I'm only worried about liquid
entering the equipment.

40
00:04:55,361 --> 00:04:57,090
A drop or two won't kill anything.

41
00:05:01,267 --> 00:05:02,359
Who told you?

42
00:05:02,602 --> 00:05:03,796
Best if it's not true.

43
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:06,397
Breaking up in December is so ruthless!

44
00:05:06,873 --> 00:05:08,864
Is there a rule?

45
00:05:08,941 --> 00:05:09,965
A Space Safety Provision?

46
00:05:10,043 --> 00:05:12,068
No, it's the Peace on Earth Regulation!

47
00:05:12,779 --> 00:05:15,680
What's your glorious theory? Tell me.

48
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:19,649
December, January and February
have the most holidays.

49
00:05:19,786 --> 00:05:23,278
Once separated,
you'll open presents alone at Christmas.

50
00:05:23,389 --> 00:05:25,857
Countdown to New Year's alone.

51
00:05:26,092 --> 00:05:30,222
Spend the Lunar New Year
tormented by friends and family,

52
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:32,025
asking when are you getting married.

53
00:05:32,131 --> 00:05:33,655
Finally, you'll spend

54
00:05:34,233 --> 00:05:36,497
Valentine's Day eating
a "lover's set" all by yourself

55
00:05:36,636 --> 00:05:41,073
because that's the only thing
on the restaurant menu.

56
00:05:41,674 --> 00:05:44,336
So don't you think this is really cruel?

57
00:05:44,444 --> 00:05:46,002
Then why did you break up
with me in December?

58
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:47,273
You broke up with me!

59
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:50,783
December 20th, 2001. 18:50 hours.

60
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:52,112
I got your e-mail.

61
00:05:52,218 --> 00:05:54,413
YOU wanted the break up.
YOU were so nasty!

62
00:05:54,487 --> 00:05:56,045
It was raining cats and dogs that day.

63
00:05:56,656 --> 00:05:59,250
I waited three hours for Miss Huang
and she never showed up!

64
00:05:59,325 --> 00:06:02,817
My! It was a sunny day, Mr. Chan!

65
00:06:03,062 --> 00:06:05,758
Would you mind re-checking
the weather report?

66
00:06:05,832 --> 00:06:07,163
Go ahead.

67
00:06:07,934 --> 00:06:09,731
-Honey?
-I'm not your honey!

68
00:06:10,703 --> 00:06:13,331
Don't get angry.
Your body will short-circuit.

69
00:06:14,841 --> 00:06:16,741
It was you who broke up with me.

70
00:06:18,277 --> 00:06:19,266
It was you! You!

71
00:06:19,345 --> 00:06:20,334
-You!
-You!

72
00:06:20,446 --> 00:06:22,243
Liar! You are!!!

73
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:32,282
Oh, I'm sorry, Miss Huang.

74
00:06:32,525 --> 00:06:34,356
Have you forgotten
that we're in outer space?!

75
00:06:36,295 --> 00:06:37,523
Calm down!

76
00:06:47,273 --> 00:06:48,399
Keep calm!

77
00:06:49,475 --> 00:06:50,567
Doesn't it hurt?

78
00:07:04,157 --> 00:07:05,624
How have you been?

79
00:07:07,393 --> 00:07:10,191
I was fired again.

80
00:07:11,364 --> 00:07:12,729
What for?

81
00:07:15,701 --> 00:07:19,398
The cash from that customer
was just too dirty.

82
00:07:19,505 --> 00:07:21,939
I really couldn't take it.

83
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:24,005
Still afraid of germs?

84
00:07:24,076 --> 00:07:25,873
I'm actually a lot better now.

85
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:36,554
You're still in denial.

86
00:07:36,656 --> 00:07:39,591
As part of the behavioral therapy,

87
00:07:39,826 --> 00:07:41,589
we set up cameras around your home.

88
00:07:41,727 --> 00:07:43,661
Here's the result. Look.

89
00:07:45,198 --> 00:07:46,688
You were wiping the windows...

90
00:07:46,766 --> 00:07:49,200
2:30 am, you were cleaning the table.

91
00:07:49,735 --> 00:07:52,602
3:00 am, vacuuming.

92
00:07:53,172 --> 00:07:55,470
Seems to me you're getting worse.

93
00:07:55,808 --> 00:07:57,742
Since 7 years ago, when your boyfriend...

94
00:07:58,144 --> 00:07:59,406
He conned me!

95
00:07:59,912 --> 00:08:01,709
He said he'd marry me,

96
00:08:01,781 --> 00:08:04,181
and then he took
all my money from the bank

97
00:08:04,851 --> 00:08:06,682
and ran away with another woman!

98
00:08:07,253 --> 00:08:09,221
I understand.

99
00:08:09,822 --> 00:08:10,914
That's just the first step.

100
00:08:12,358 --> 00:08:13,655
That's only the first step?

101
00:08:14,694 --> 00:08:15,718
I've already forgotten
everything about him,

102
00:08:15,795 --> 00:08:16,784
and it's only the first step?

103
00:08:16,863 --> 00:08:18,194
The problem isn't with him.

104
00:08:18,264 --> 00:08:19,492
-It's with you.
-Me?

105
00:08:19,799 --> 00:08:23,257
Molysmophobia is like
your safe house from love.

106
00:08:23,369 --> 00:08:25,837
If you don't open
the doors wide and step out,

107
00:08:26,272 --> 00:08:27,762
you'll never overcome your illness.

108
00:08:28,574 --> 00:08:29,802
How?

109
00:08:29,876 --> 00:08:33,368
L-O-V-E, love again.

110
00:08:35,815 --> 00:08:36,839
No, I don't want...

111
00:08:39,886 --> 00:08:43,014
How long has it been
since you said "l love you" to someone?

112
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:48,421
Say it after me.

113
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:50,655
"l love you."

114
00:08:54,433 --> 00:08:59,029
I... Iove... you.

115
00:08:59,805 --> 00:09:02,365
Brilliant! Say it loud!

116
00:09:03,643 --> 00:09:06,237
-I love you.
-Like you really mean it! "l love you! "

117
00:09:06,312 --> 00:09:08,610
-I love you!
-LOUDER! "l love you!"

118
00:09:09,115 --> 00:09:10,844
I love you!" I love you!"

119
00:09:10,917 --> 00:09:14,114
I love you!!!

120
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:22,493
See you next week.

121
00:09:27,633 --> 00:09:31,228
Holy moly! What's with all this trash?!

122
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:35,466
Whoa, it's heavy!

123
00:09:35,541 --> 00:09:37,372
Don't force yourself, Dad. Take it easy!

124
00:09:37,476 --> 00:09:38,738
No problem. Ever since the operation,

125
00:09:38,878 --> 00:09:40,311
I've been stronger than a tiger!

126
00:09:41,948 --> 00:09:43,677
You gotta take a break. Let me do it!

127
00:09:45,117 --> 00:09:46,345
Oh, no!

128
00:09:46,452 --> 00:09:47,441
What's wrong?

129
00:09:48,321 --> 00:09:50,380
That's your mom's favorite singer.

130
00:09:50,489 --> 00:09:52,150
She hasn't performed here
in over a decade,

131
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:53,657
and I forgot to book tickets.

132
00:09:54,293 --> 00:09:55,453
I'm so dead!

133
00:09:58,331 --> 00:09:59,491
Dad...

134
00:10:00,466 --> 00:10:02,934
did Mom ever resent you
for being a garbage man?

135
00:10:04,337 --> 00:10:07,829
Our first kiss was in the garbage truck!

136
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:09,129
Relationship problems?

137
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:13,973
Relationship problems are like toothaches.
They linger.

138
00:10:14,313 --> 00:10:16,304
So, okay, look.

139
00:10:16,682 --> 00:10:18,149
Next time,

140
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:21,109
before the date, the movie,
the holding of hands, the kissing,

141
00:10:21,187 --> 00:10:23,678
I'll just tell her that I'm a garbage man.

142
00:10:23,756 --> 00:10:25,883
Then we won't waste each other's time.

143
00:10:26,926 --> 00:10:29,258
Congratulations, you've got it!

144
00:10:41,173 --> 00:10:43,835
Excuse me. Table for one. Please.

145
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:45,899
Do you mind sharing?

146
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:47,036
-No.
-Yes.

147
00:10:50,349 --> 00:10:51,646
Hi, can I take your order?

148
00:10:51,784 --> 00:10:53,342
Fish and chips.

149
00:10:54,954 --> 00:10:57,388
And... anything to drink with that?

150
00:10:57,523 --> 00:10:58,649
Ice tea.

151
00:11:01,827 --> 00:11:03,317
No ice?

152
00:11:03,396 --> 00:11:04,624
Me too.

153
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:05,719
Okay.

154
00:11:05,798 --> 00:11:06,787
Thanks.

155
00:11:18,444 --> 00:11:20,002
So you're Chinese?

156
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,069
Me too.

157
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:33,683
Sorry,

158
00:11:35,661 --> 00:11:36,787
I'll get them to clean it up.

159
00:11:36,862 --> 00:11:38,625
No! Their towels are even dirtier!

160
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:39,722
International Health Regulations state that

161
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:40,959
a dishwasher's temperature
must be high enough

162
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:42,432
to effectively kill germs.

163
00:11:42,501 --> 00:11:43,991
Otherwise, there's no point to washing.

164
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:46,094
185 degrees!

165
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:47,396
You know it?

166
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:50,040
Otherwise, there'd be salmonella,

167
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:51,707
and you may get food poisoning.

168
00:11:58,818 --> 00:11:59,807
What's wrong?

169
00:11:59,885 --> 00:12:01,113
Food on my face?

170
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:14,291
Do you have time to go to
a movie with me tonight?

171
00:12:14,366 --> 00:12:15,663
Sounds good!

172
00:12:17,536 --> 00:12:19,868
Good idea... but we've just met.

173
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:22,703
Then let me introduce myself first.

174
00:12:22,842 --> 00:12:24,309
Wait! Sorry...

175
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:26,808
I promised myselfthat I'd tell a date

176
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:29,245
what I do for a living before we go out.

177
00:12:29,315 --> 00:12:31,112
Wait! Let me guess!

178
00:12:31,684 --> 00:12:33,151
You're in the art world?

179
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:35,686
A collector... Artwork collector?

180
00:12:35,821 --> 00:12:39,086
Old stuff that people don't want... I collect.

181
00:12:39,225 --> 00:12:40,556
Antiques?!

182
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:42,249
No...

183
00:12:42,561 --> 00:12:43,823
I got it!

184
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:45,859
Since you're so familiar
with the lnternational Health Regulations,

185
00:12:45,965 --> 00:12:47,728
you must be a specialist
collecting bioenvironmental data.

186
00:12:47,867 --> 00:12:49,129
Glad to know you!

187
00:12:52,338 --> 00:12:54,431
I'm... a garbage collector.

188
00:13:01,747 --> 00:13:02,873
Nice meeting you!

189
00:13:04,917 --> 00:13:05,906
Wait!

190
00:13:08,654 --> 00:13:09,848
Wait! Listen to me...

191
00:13:10,256 --> 00:13:12,588
Your body language speaks for you!

192
00:13:12,892 --> 00:13:14,291
But I'm very proud to be a garbage man!

193
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:16,123
-Listen to me. I...
-See you!

194
00:13:17,596 --> 00:13:19,791
No, never!

195
00:13:20,599 --> 00:13:21,657
Wait!

196
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:36,714
Nominations for the Worst Actress are:

197
00:13:36,782 --> 00:13:39,478
Zhang Qianqian, Yang Lifang,
and Peony Huang.

198
00:13:39,552 --> 00:13:41,747
Let's watch Peony Huang's performance.

199
00:13:45,191 --> 00:13:48,991
Seven Star Fists!

200
00:13:56,569 --> 00:13:58,560
Peony Huang is Worst Actress!

201
00:13:58,704 --> 00:13:59,830
Let's welcome Peony Huang.

202
00:13:59,939 --> 00:14:05,377
Peony Huang! We love you!

203
00:14:07,746 --> 00:14:08,735
Thank you.

204
00:14:09,648 --> 00:14:11,377
Thank you, everyone, for spurring me on.

205
00:14:15,187 --> 00:14:16,814
I, Peony Huang, promise that,

206
00:14:16,989 --> 00:14:19,253
I definitely won't receive
this award next year.

207
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:20,915
Absolutely not!

208
00:14:40,145 --> 00:14:41,737
"Full Moon in Paris"
starts shooting in two weeks.

209
00:14:41,847 --> 00:14:44,042
Uncle Hua, just drive.

210
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:46,681
I can't. We're boxed in!

211
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:49,752
I must work as a waitress in a cafe
for the next two weeks.

212
00:14:49,955 --> 00:14:50,944
What?

213
00:14:51,757 --> 00:14:53,748
What role do I play in "Full Moon in Paris"?

214
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:56,425
A cafe waitress.

215
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:59,190
Exactly. I have to experience
the feeling of being a waitress myself!

216
00:14:59,298 --> 00:15:02,597
Since I was 13,
my everyday schedule is make-up,

217
00:15:02,668 --> 00:15:05,364
photo shoots, film shoots,
plane rides, and ribbon cuttings.

218
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:06,938
I've never even taken a public bus ride.

219
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,868
I have no idea about the life
of a normal person,

220
00:15:11,176 --> 00:15:13,076
yet I have to play one.

221
00:15:16,315 --> 00:15:18,249
-I really do think I'm terrible!
-Peony...

222
00:15:18,317 --> 00:15:19,750
Anyway, I don't care.

223
00:15:19,818 --> 00:15:22,082
I'm going to go undercover
at a cafe for two weeks!

224
00:15:22,488 --> 00:15:23,785
Look.

225
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:27,791
Everyone in China knows you.

226
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:31,529
Can you really be
an ordinary cafe waitress?

227
00:15:32,898 --> 00:15:33,887
Can you?

228
00:15:37,403 --> 00:15:38,893
No one gets it!

229
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:41,701
None ofthem!

230
00:15:42,708 --> 00:15:44,266
All vulgar!

231
00:15:45,844 --> 00:15:46,936
I'm not writing anymore.

232
00:15:47,746 --> 00:15:49,304
Why should I write?

233
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:53,678
Hell! I'm not writing anymore!

234
00:16:00,693 --> 00:16:03,161
Are you crazy? Your manuscript!

235
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:05,256
Being a writer is your dream!

236
00:16:05,431 --> 00:16:07,422
What good is a dream?

237
00:16:07,533 --> 00:16:09,160
I've been writing for a year.

238
00:16:10,135 --> 00:16:11,693
Have you seen me collect a single cent?

239
00:16:11,837 --> 00:16:13,270
Have you seen anything published?

240
00:16:13,372 --> 00:16:16,671
Well... it's your dream.
You can't be frightened of poverty.

241
00:16:17,076 --> 00:16:21,274
The most important thing now
is to survive and be well-fed!

242
00:16:22,314 --> 00:16:24,874
Tell me, which is more important,

243
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:26,440
bread or your dream?

244
00:16:27,052 --> 00:16:28,644
Bread!

245
00:16:29,321 --> 00:16:32,119
It'd be even better to have it with yogurt.

246
00:16:39,732 --> 00:16:42,257
Our cafe needs help these days.

247
00:16:42,368 --> 00:16:43,733
Why don't you try it out?

248
00:16:46,071 --> 00:16:47,470
Okay...

249
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:56,645
Is this normal enough?

250
00:16:56,715 --> 00:16:57,704
Still a bit off.

251
00:16:59,752 --> 00:17:00,776
And now?

252
00:17:03,122 --> 00:17:04,111
I got it!

253
00:17:06,892 --> 00:17:09,190
This will do, right?

254
00:17:19,905 --> 00:17:21,202
Presbyopic glasses?

255
00:17:22,341 --> 00:17:23,330
So dizzy.

256
00:17:31,784 --> 00:17:33,012
What the...

257
00:17:33,819 --> 00:17:35,946
I'm sorry. Are you okay?

258
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:37,279
I'm fine.

259
00:17:39,758 --> 00:17:41,020
You are...

260
00:17:41,627 --> 00:17:42,958
I'm here for the interview.

261
00:17:43,362 --> 00:17:47,025
Two words describe our training method:

262
00:17:47,199 --> 00:17:48,632
Strict. Stricter.

263
00:17:48,801 --> 00:17:52,635
How you hold the tray must
meet international standards.

264
00:17:53,038 --> 00:17:55,472
Use three fingers and only your left hand.

265
00:17:55,607 --> 00:17:56,904
Understand?

266
00:17:57,042 --> 00:17:58,532
-Fatty, check the coffee.
-Okay!

267
00:17:59,845 --> 00:18:01,107
Hold up your head...

268
00:18:01,246 --> 00:18:02,611
Yes, stand straight.

269
00:18:02,681 --> 00:18:04,308
Give me some smiles.

270
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:07,483
Customer comes first. You should smile
when you greet a customer.

271
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:09,178
Smiles...

272
00:18:10,055 --> 00:18:11,784
You're alright. Okay.

273
00:18:12,024 --> 00:18:13,889
Follow me.

274
00:18:14,026 --> 00:18:16,517
Hold the trays with steady hands.

275
00:18:16,662 --> 00:18:19,062
Let's walk around the restaurant once.

276
00:18:19,131 --> 00:18:20,689
Move it!

277
00:18:23,268 --> 00:18:25,793
Ifthe coffee spills a drop,

278
00:18:25,871 --> 00:18:27,805
I'm not going to hire you.

279
00:18:34,913 --> 00:18:36,210
Stop!

280
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:37,873
What are you doing? A war?

281
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:40,009
Don't you know how expensive it is?

282
00:18:40,085 --> 00:18:41,950
What's going on with you?

283
00:18:42,087 --> 00:18:44,248
You, out...

284
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:49,560
This... isn't too bad.

285
00:18:52,831 --> 00:18:56,232
This... isn't exactly going to pass.

286
00:18:56,335 --> 00:18:59,133
Stand straight but not 90 degrees.
A slight slant goes a long way.

287
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:01,932
-Manager!
-What?

288
00:19:02,241 --> 00:19:06,575
Well said! And he looks like a poet.

289
00:19:06,712 --> 00:19:09,545
Say, if we hire him,

290
00:19:09,648 --> 00:19:14,176
our professional image will rise!

291
00:19:16,555 --> 00:19:19,991
Chest up, chin up, stand still.

292
00:19:20,359 --> 00:19:22,486
Fine, the two of you start tomorrow.

293
00:19:28,534 --> 00:19:30,058
Hey, your hand...

294
00:19:36,942 --> 00:19:38,307
I'm so dizzy...

295
00:19:40,479 --> 00:19:42,071
You look like that...

296
00:19:42,314 --> 00:19:43,474
Who?

297
00:19:43,549 --> 00:19:45,915
-That Worst Actress!
-What Worst Actress?

298
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:48,782
Why would she come work here?
That's crazy!

299
00:19:56,762 --> 00:19:58,957
I'm Wen Feng. What's your name?

300
00:19:59,131 --> 00:20:00,689
I'm... Xiao Huang.

301
00:20:02,768 --> 00:20:03,962
Xiao Huang!

302
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:07,038
My new co-worker, here's a watermelon.

303
00:20:09,174 --> 00:20:12,109
My watermelons are crispy and sweet!

304
00:20:17,249 --> 00:20:19,012
Such a dumb gift.

305
00:20:23,622 --> 00:20:24,646
-Good morning!
-Good morning!

306
00:20:24,756 --> 00:20:26,087
-You first!
-You first!

307
00:20:29,795 --> 00:20:31,194
Ladies first.

308
00:20:32,297 --> 00:20:33,662
Trying to be a gentleman?

309
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,199
Always!

310
00:21:15,741 --> 00:21:20,508
MATW, check. Normal.

311
00:21:20,812 --> 00:21:21,904
Honey,

312
00:21:22,881 --> 00:21:25,543
fancy a chocolate?

313
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:33,281
I've only got one, right?

314
00:21:34,893 --> 00:21:36,417
You might regret it.

315
00:21:43,335 --> 00:21:47,772
Don't want it, fine, I'll enjoy it!

316
00:21:50,942 --> 00:21:52,136
Where is it?

317
00:21:53,045 --> 00:21:56,845
My choco... choco?

318
00:22:01,486 --> 00:22:06,389
Wait...! Hold it in...! Take a deep breath!

319
00:22:08,593 --> 00:22:09,753
Think about something else...

320
00:22:13,498 --> 00:22:15,398
Say...!

321
00:22:15,701 --> 00:22:17,191
Feeling any better? Okay!

322
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:18,701
I swallowed it.

323
00:22:18,904 --> 00:22:20,201
Oh no... you swallowed it?!

324
00:22:25,811 --> 00:22:29,542
I told you, one in five astronauts

325
00:22:29,614 --> 00:22:31,707
would have a reaction.

326
00:22:32,384 --> 00:22:33,681
You're that "one".

327
00:22:34,553 --> 00:22:36,612
It's 6.35...

328
00:22:37,656 --> 00:22:38,680
35...

329
00:22:38,757 --> 00:22:40,156
You can't keep throwing up.

330
00:22:40,225 --> 00:22:42,216
-Let me give you a shot!
-No!

331
00:22:42,294 --> 00:22:43,761
Just relax, okay?

332
00:22:44,930 --> 00:22:46,420
If I take the injection, it'll be reported.

333
00:22:46,531 --> 00:22:48,192
How will I ever return to space
after this mission?

334
00:22:48,734 --> 00:22:51,202
If you keep throwing up,
you'll become dehydrated!

335
00:23:00,979 --> 00:23:03,243
About just now... I'm sorry.

336
00:23:04,549 --> 00:23:07,211
I'll report that I experienced the reaction,

337
00:23:08,453 --> 00:23:10,216
and that I took the injection. It will be fine.

338
00:23:10,355 --> 00:23:14,792
I threw up on my last trip, it's no big deal.

339
00:23:16,862 --> 00:23:18,329
Why are you covering for me?

340
00:23:19,598 --> 00:23:20,622
Rose,

341
00:23:21,633 --> 00:23:22,998
I read your mind,

342
00:23:24,269 --> 00:23:25,327
don't force yourself.

343
00:23:25,404 --> 00:23:26,735
I'm not.

344
00:23:27,672 --> 00:23:29,401
You're a real astronaut.

345
00:23:30,275 --> 00:23:32,971
Who cares if you're the first choice
or the backup?

346
00:23:36,948 --> 00:23:40,008
This is your achievement
from years of hard work and persistence.

347
00:23:40,886 --> 00:23:43,377
No one can take that away from you.

348
00:23:48,794 --> 00:23:50,819
How did we start the fight that year?

349
00:23:58,370 --> 00:24:00,031
I think it was over a cup of coffee.

350
00:24:00,505 --> 00:24:01,494
Right...

351
00:24:01,873 --> 00:24:03,363
We went from varieties of coffee

352
00:24:03,442 --> 00:24:05,307
to the subject of order in the universe.

353
00:24:06,077 --> 00:24:07,704
The philosophy of self.

354
00:24:08,613 --> 00:24:09,910
The fight was really stupid.

355
00:24:10,015 --> 00:24:13,382
Then we had a cold war for 3 months...

356
00:24:13,785 --> 00:24:14,911
We didn't see each other.

357
00:24:15,787 --> 00:24:18,051
Finally we agreed to meet...

358
00:24:19,591 --> 00:24:20,853
It was raining hard that day

359
00:24:21,793 --> 00:24:23,317
and I waited for you in
the ice cream shop for 3 hours.

360
00:24:23,395 --> 00:24:24,862
I was at the ice cream shop, too.

361
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:25,954
-Which one did you go to?
-Which one did you go to?

362
00:24:26,031 --> 00:24:27,589
-Florida.
-Los Angeles.

363
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:30,825
I thought we should meet at the one
where we'd spent Valentine's Day.

364
00:24:34,005 --> 00:24:35,632
We went to both...

365
00:24:37,509 --> 00:24:39,409
If I wasn't there, you should've called me.

366
00:24:39,478 --> 00:24:40,843
I sent you an e-mail.

367
00:24:40,946 --> 00:24:42,846
Right, two words in your e-mail:
"Good bye."

368
00:24:42,948 --> 00:24:45,143
You told me that if you didn't show up
then it means we're over.

369
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:46,274
If a man wants out,

370
00:24:46,351 --> 00:24:47,841
it's so uncool for a woman
to beg to go back!

371
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:49,113
Okay... Okay!

372
00:24:51,122 --> 00:24:52,146
Let's not talk about this anymore.

373
00:25:19,251 --> 00:25:20,775
Shut up!

374
00:25:25,891 --> 00:25:27,290
I have to get a job.

375
00:25:30,095 --> 00:25:31,119
One,

376
00:25:32,564 --> 00:25:33,553
two...

377
00:25:33,798 --> 00:25:37,290
Orchid, rose, lemon,
almond, jasmine, lavender

378
00:25:40,005 --> 00:25:41,097
Fifty-one,

379
00:25:42,007 --> 00:25:43,565
fifty-two,

380
00:25:44,309 --> 00:25:45,298
fifty-three...

381
00:25:59,691 --> 00:26:01,158
Fresh day!

382
00:26:02,894 --> 00:26:04,452
Mom, you're really cooking?!

383
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:08,393
Surprised you? People change.

384
00:26:10,535 --> 00:26:12,435
Come on, give me some praise!

385
00:26:13,705 --> 00:26:14,933
Mom, you're amazing!

386
00:26:15,006 --> 00:26:17,338
Once I've mastered cooking,

387
00:26:17,509 --> 00:26:19,272
you'll have an excuse to visit me.

388
00:26:19,844 --> 00:26:20,936
Agree?

389
00:26:22,547 --> 00:26:24,310
Do you need some money?

390
00:26:24,716 --> 00:26:25,705
No, I'm fine,

391
00:26:27,586 --> 00:26:29,850
I just got a raise and a promotion.

392
00:26:30,822 --> 00:26:31,982
Don't worry about me.

393
00:26:32,324 --> 00:26:34,519
My three babies,

394
00:26:35,126 --> 00:26:37,856
The big one, she's up in space,

395
00:26:37,963 --> 00:26:39,931
so I can't do anything for her.

396
00:26:40,532 --> 00:26:43,296
The little one, stays with me
but she is driving me crazy.

397
00:26:43,568 --> 00:26:45,968
But Mom worries about you the most.

398
00:26:47,372 --> 00:26:48,566
Baby...

399
00:26:49,874 --> 00:26:52,741
you always keep things to yourself,

400
00:26:52,978 --> 00:26:54,946
you never tell your mom a thing.

401
00:26:55,447 --> 00:26:57,540
Mom, I'm really fine.

402
00:26:58,583 --> 00:26:59,948
I have to get to work now...

403
00:27:00,018 --> 00:27:02,680
Bye bye, see you!

404
00:27:02,821 --> 00:27:03,810
Bye bye!

405
00:27:36,788 --> 00:27:39,222
Come, come on in!

406
00:27:41,292 --> 00:27:45,786
Hua, how's my little one doing at work?

407
00:27:45,997 --> 00:27:47,589
Not bad. She's a good kid.

408
00:27:47,699 --> 00:27:49,667
She's stubborn. No good!!

409
00:27:52,203 --> 00:27:53,727
I made some dumplings last night.

410
00:27:53,805 --> 00:27:55,864
But I couldn't finish them on my own,
so I brought you some.

411
00:27:56,307 --> 00:27:57,296
Sure. What's inside them?

412
00:27:57,409 --> 00:27:58,637
Chives and eggs.

413
00:27:58,810 --> 00:27:59,936
I love them.

414
00:28:00,245 --> 00:28:03,544
When we were overseas,
I used to make dumplings

415
00:28:03,682 --> 00:28:06,150
together with their father
after the restaurant closed for the night.

416
00:28:06,818 --> 00:28:10,310
They smell great.
Many foreigners love to eat dumplings.

417
00:28:10,455 --> 00:28:11,615
Dum... what?

418
00:28:11,890 --> 00:28:14,290
"Jiao Zi". Dumplings!

419
00:28:14,826 --> 00:28:19,320
We were so busy back then, so, so busy...

420
00:28:19,431 --> 00:28:21,661
that we almost forgot who we were.

421
00:28:21,733 --> 00:28:23,826
Oh no, I'm late!

422
00:28:24,135 --> 00:28:26,160
What're you in a rush for? Take it easy!

423
00:28:27,005 --> 00:28:28,165
Where are your manners?

424
00:28:28,239 --> 00:28:29,263
Morning, Mom.

425
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:30,830
-And?
-I'm really running late!

426
00:28:30,909 --> 00:28:32,774
Give me a hug...

427
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:36,343
Baby, how does Mom look today?

428
00:28:36,481 --> 00:28:38,142
Wow, gorgeous!

429
00:28:40,752 --> 00:28:42,083
Get running, Uncle Hua!

430
00:28:42,153 --> 00:28:43,142
Uncle Hua, I have the early shift
at the cafe today.

431
00:28:43,254 --> 00:28:44,346
Don't worry, we'll make it.

432
00:28:44,923 --> 00:28:46,447
Your mom seems to really like flowers.

433
00:28:46,591 --> 00:28:49,025
Flowers?
Yes, we're all named after flowers,

434
00:28:49,094 --> 00:28:50,561
didn't you realize...

435
00:28:51,329 --> 00:28:52,557
Poor Dad,

436
00:28:52,664 --> 00:28:54,689
he'd be given a flower shirt
every year for his birthday.

437
00:28:54,833 --> 00:28:55,822
Flower shirts...

438
00:28:56,735 --> 00:28:59,135
Hey, Uncle Hua, let's go.

439
00:29:03,174 --> 00:29:04,732
Thank you, please come again.

440
00:29:05,577 --> 00:29:06,839
Xiao Huang!

441
00:29:11,683 --> 00:29:13,310
A strawberry pudding, and a cup of latte.

442
00:29:13,752 --> 00:29:16,186
What is it? It looks terrible!

443
00:29:16,554 --> 00:29:18,283
Latte Art, it's poetic, got it?

444
00:29:18,456 --> 00:29:20,515
How is it poetic? I can't tell

445
00:29:20,592 --> 00:29:22,651
If your heart were like mine,

446
00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:24,456
I will bear all the pain it has to take.

447
00:29:24,896 --> 00:29:25,954
What're you talking about?

448
00:29:26,064 --> 00:29:27,190
What?

449
00:29:27,298 --> 00:29:29,459
It's a heart! Can't you tell?

450
00:29:30,201 --> 00:29:33,728
A broken heart? Are you...

451
00:29:38,409 --> 00:29:40,138
Sir, your latte...

452
00:29:44,415 --> 00:29:46,679
Flowers are blossoming on me today!

453
00:30:08,907 --> 00:30:10,841
You look so much younger!

454
00:30:11,943 --> 00:30:14,002
You look actually a lot younger today!

455
00:30:15,146 --> 00:30:16,340
Is the kid late again?

456
00:30:16,414 --> 00:30:18,439
No, I got here half an hour early.

457
00:30:18,550 --> 00:30:20,882
How did you prepare
the dumplings from yesterday?

458
00:30:20,952 --> 00:30:21,976
They were really delicious.

459
00:30:22,053 --> 00:30:23,213
Really?

460
00:30:23,755 --> 00:30:25,245
So much better than the ones

461
00:30:25,356 --> 00:30:27,722
at our old Chinatown restaurant.

462
00:30:27,792 --> 00:30:29,521
I was a cook when I was young.

463
00:30:29,661 --> 00:30:32,562
Then I injured my wrist,
and I couldn't even lift a spatula.

464
00:30:32,730 --> 00:30:35,858
I see. Can you teach me
how to cook sometime?

465
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,662
Sure, I can come
an hour early from now on.

466
00:30:38,837 --> 00:30:40,805
I'm kidding. You must be busy.

467
00:30:40,939 --> 00:30:42,167
Come, sit down. Want a drink?

468
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:44,367
It would be fine with me.
I've got spare time.

469
00:30:45,944 --> 00:30:49,436
Good morning everybody!
This is Zhu, your DJ today.

470
00:30:49,581 --> 00:30:52,141
To all old and new friends in Chinatown,

471
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:54,218
I would like to announce today

472
00:30:54,352 --> 00:30:58,083
the most exciting day of the year,

473
00:30:58,223 --> 00:31:00,214
we will award a very big prize.

474
00:31:00,291 --> 00:31:02,191
You got it right!

475
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:04,194
It's our annual
Mid-Autumn impersonation contest!

476
00:31:04,262 --> 00:31:05,786
If you're the first person to make it

477
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:07,456
to our radio station
with your great costume,

478
00:31:07,599 --> 00:31:08,657
then you will be the winner!

479
00:31:08,766 --> 00:31:13,533
Our prize today includes $10,000 in cash!
C-A-S-H, cash!

480
00:31:13,905 --> 00:31:15,839
And the most highly-anticipated
event in Chinatown...

481
00:31:15,907 --> 00:31:18,967
Already sold-out
Lady Siu-fung concert ticket for...

482
00:31:19,077 --> 00:31:20,510
Two! The tickets Dad wants!

483
00:31:20,578 --> 00:31:23,638
Worth getting?
Who would you impersonate today?

484
00:31:23,715 --> 00:31:25,615
The moon fairy? No...!

485
00:31:25,683 --> 00:31:27,048
This time, we want you all
to dress up as someone,

486
00:31:27,118 --> 00:31:29,086
that has nothing to do
with the Mid-Autumn Festival,

487
00:31:29,187 --> 00:31:31,246
and that someone is... Cupid!

488
00:31:31,789 --> 00:31:32,847
-Cupid?
-...Cupid...

489
00:31:32,924 --> 00:31:35,552
As Cupid
you must have two wings on your back

490
00:31:35,627 --> 00:31:37,788
and a bow and arrow in your hand!

491
00:31:38,930 --> 00:31:40,022
Okay, right now!

492
00:31:40,098 --> 00:31:41,463
The competition starts right now,

493
00:31:41,532 --> 00:31:44,057
and the first person
who arrives here will be the winner!

494
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:24,831
Cupid!

495
00:32:54,605 --> 00:32:59,542
Quick! $10,000 in cash.

496
00:33:05,516 --> 00:33:09,145
Yes... come on...!

497
00:33:10,021 --> 00:33:11,010
Hurry up!

498
00:33:11,723 --> 00:33:12,815
Wait!

499
00:33:15,126 --> 00:33:16,115
You!

500
00:33:19,897 --> 00:33:21,364
Isn't it the 10th floor?

501
00:33:26,738 --> 00:33:28,228
Come on.

502
00:34:10,348 --> 00:34:12,543
So today's winner is...

503
00:34:12,617 --> 00:34:14,175
-Johnny.
-Lily.

504
00:34:14,252 --> 00:34:15,947
-Come on, I got here first.
-I got here first.

505
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:17,078
I'm first...

506
00:34:17,155 --> 00:34:19,089
Well, who wins?

507
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:20,248
Lily.

508
00:34:20,358 --> 00:34:21,916
-Johnny.
-Yes!

509
00:34:21,993 --> 00:34:24,257
And Lily!

510
00:34:24,362 --> 00:34:26,694
Both are winners,
and the prizes belong to you both.

511
00:34:27,031 --> 00:34:28,555
The cash prize and the tickets...

512
00:34:32,770 --> 00:34:34,294
I was here first!

513
00:34:34,472 --> 00:34:36,872
-It's mine!
-I am the winner!

514
00:34:39,010 --> 00:34:41,274
We each get half, fair?

515
00:34:46,451 --> 00:34:48,180
-You have some problem.
-I don't!

516
00:34:52,256 --> 00:34:53,484
Sorry.

517
00:34:55,426 --> 00:34:58,054
Molysmophobia. Fear of bacteria.

518
00:34:58,796 --> 00:35:01,321
-That's why last time...
-You took me the wrong way.

519
00:35:01,666 --> 00:35:05,329
Sorry, I thought you're
just like those other girls,

520
00:35:05,436 --> 00:35:08,303
who avoid me because of my job.

521
00:35:08,406 --> 00:35:09,839
No, that's not my intention.

522
00:35:14,846 --> 00:35:16,143
Never mind.

523
00:35:16,314 --> 00:35:19,545
It won't make much of a difference,
as I can't get closer to you.

524
00:35:20,051 --> 00:35:21,518
-No, it's different.
-How?

525
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:24,145
At least you won't look down on me.

526
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:32,757
If someone said to you, "l love you."

527
00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:36,157
How would you answer back to win?

528
00:35:36,934 --> 00:35:37,958
To win?

529
00:35:39,070 --> 00:35:42,062
The quiz show on TV last night.

530
00:35:43,741 --> 00:35:44,935
I don't know.

531
00:35:45,042 --> 00:35:49,172
The answer is "l love you more! "

532
00:35:52,116 --> 00:35:53,515
This is a good one, right?

533
00:35:53,851 --> 00:35:55,318
Come on...

534
00:35:55,486 --> 00:35:56,783
What about the tickets?

535
00:35:56,888 --> 00:35:58,321
I'm not interested, they're all yours.

536
00:35:58,389 --> 00:35:59,378
Thank you.

537
00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:02,792
Thanks for the tickets.

538
00:36:05,329 --> 00:36:07,354
Sorry that I broke your wing.

539
00:36:07,498 --> 00:36:09,125
Now you won't be able to fly.

540
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:10,765
Same as you.

541
00:36:11,569 --> 00:36:13,730
But if we stick together,

542
00:36:13,871 --> 00:36:15,702
wouldn't we have a pair of wings then?

543
00:36:18,409 --> 00:36:20,138
Then we can fly.

544
00:36:20,978 --> 00:36:21,967
That's right!

545
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:24,513
Is that possible?

546
00:36:25,283 --> 00:36:26,307
Shall we try!

547
00:36:26,784 --> 00:36:28,081
How?

548
00:36:28,186 --> 00:36:29,278
Give me a moment...

549
00:36:51,008 --> 00:36:52,339
I failed miserably today.

550
00:36:52,443 --> 00:36:56,345
Starting tomorrow,
I must learn how to control myself.

551
00:36:57,048 --> 00:37:00,506
After 13 years of waiting,
finally I am up in space.

552
00:37:01,352 --> 00:37:03,582
But out of 127 other astronauts,

553
00:37:03,654 --> 00:37:06,282
why did they send us together?!

554
00:37:06,624 --> 00:37:07,716
Could this be...

555
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:10,450
fate?

556
00:37:13,764 --> 00:37:15,561
How could there be any misunderstanding?

557
00:37:21,939 --> 00:37:22,928
Michael,

558
00:37:29,046 --> 00:37:31,378
I really did go to look for you.

559
00:37:34,051 --> 00:37:36,815
But I saw you walking behind a hot babe,

560
00:37:37,688 --> 00:37:40,987
and I heard you calling
her "sweetie, sweetie",

561
00:37:42,226 --> 00:37:43,625
so full of affection...

562
00:37:50,701 --> 00:37:51,895
Misunderstanding?

563
00:38:03,848 --> 00:38:06,078
Where do you live, Huang?

564
00:38:06,183 --> 00:38:07,207
Need a ride?

565
00:38:07,285 --> 00:38:09,446
No thanks.
All those watermelons, aren't they heavy?

566
00:38:09,587 --> 00:38:11,111
What's up? Scared?

567
00:38:11,188 --> 00:38:12,212
Not at all!

568
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:13,450
Then come on up!

569
00:38:13,724 --> 00:38:14,850
No problem!

570
00:38:17,194 --> 00:38:18,957
Why do you sell watermelons after work?

571
00:38:21,666 --> 00:38:23,099
To make money.

572
00:38:23,501 --> 00:38:25,435
I need to go back to school next year.

573
00:38:25,870 --> 00:38:27,394
I must fulfill my dream.

574
00:38:27,471 --> 00:38:28,836
What's your dream?

575
00:38:31,008 --> 00:38:32,669
My dream is to make it big...

576
00:38:33,277 --> 00:38:35,336
to become a great writer.

577
00:38:35,946 --> 00:38:37,004
Not bad!

578
00:38:37,815 --> 00:38:38,941
How about you?

579
00:38:39,417 --> 00:38:41,942
I want to go rowing on Lake Houhai.

580
00:38:44,221 --> 00:38:45,552
That's considered a dream?

581
00:38:46,657 --> 00:38:48,488
To go with the one I love.

582
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:50,984
Let's go!

583
00:38:51,562 --> 00:38:52,551
Uncle Hua.

584
00:38:53,364 --> 00:38:56,265
Peony, I'm right behind you.

585
00:38:57,068 --> 00:38:58,660
What're you doing on the watermelon cart?

586
00:38:59,737 --> 00:39:01,432
Just follow me!

587
00:39:01,505 --> 00:39:03,029
That way!

588
00:39:13,851 --> 00:39:15,785
What do you think of
Peony Huang's acting?

589
00:39:16,053 --> 00:39:17,145
Peony Huang?

590
00:39:17,755 --> 00:39:19,916
Wooden delivery, emotionless face,

591
00:39:20,057 --> 00:39:22,457
empty eyes, terrible voice,

592
00:39:22,526 --> 00:39:25,188
physically awkward. seems to lack depth...

593
00:39:26,464 --> 00:39:27,556
What're you doing?!

594
00:39:27,665 --> 00:39:28,723
A mosquito.

595
00:39:31,702 --> 00:39:33,397
At least she's pretty.

596
00:39:35,339 --> 00:39:39,207
She's just so... so... I think you're prettier.

597
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:44,509
Which way is your place?

598
00:39:45,616 --> 00:39:47,413
-Over there!
-Here?

599
00:39:52,757 --> 00:39:56,215
Didn't you say you live very close-by?
Why aren't we there yet?

600
00:39:56,761 --> 00:39:57,750
-It's right here.
-Where?

601
00:39:57,828 --> 00:39:59,728
-Stop, stop!
-Okay.

602
00:40:03,901 --> 00:40:05,493
Do you want me to walk you in?

603
00:40:06,303 --> 00:40:08,965
No! My mom will ask a lot of questions.

604
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:10,630
Well, I'm running late anyway.

605
00:40:10,775 --> 00:40:12,766
I still have to get to the market.

606
00:40:14,078 --> 00:40:16,205
-Bye!
-Bye!

607
00:40:17,515 --> 00:40:18,504
Xiao Huang!

608
00:40:19,150 --> 00:40:22,244
I didn't bring anything for your family.

609
00:40:22,353 --> 00:40:24,787
Please give this watermelon to your mom.

610
00:40:26,624 --> 00:40:29,252
My watermelons are crispy and sweet!

611
00:40:32,263 --> 00:40:33,321
I'm taking off!

612
00:40:33,397 --> 00:40:35,262
-Bye!
-Bye!

613
00:41:01,792 --> 00:41:04,090
Since when do men like
to give watermelons to their dates?

614
00:41:05,429 --> 00:41:06,521
Does he like me?

615
00:41:08,065 --> 00:41:09,293
Who knows!

616
00:41:10,768 --> 00:41:12,895
It can't be. He's dorky!

617
00:41:32,223 --> 00:41:33,451
Honey...

618
00:41:36,193 --> 00:41:37,387
Come over...

619
00:41:53,444 --> 00:41:54,502
Michael.

620
00:42:05,389 --> 00:42:07,084
This is my biological clock,

621
00:42:07,892 --> 00:42:09,621
and it's almost stopped.

622
00:42:13,898 --> 00:42:16,264
I really want to have a child with you.

623
00:42:17,401 --> 00:42:18,800
I miss you,

624
00:42:20,404 --> 00:42:21,496
sweetie...

625
00:42:23,140 --> 00:42:24,334
Sweetie?

626
00:42:25,442 --> 00:42:26,841
You still miss that woman!!

627
00:42:26,911 --> 00:42:30,472
Rose, my sweetie...

628
00:42:31,849 --> 00:42:34,818
Rose, sweetie?

629
00:42:36,654 --> 00:42:38,019
I love you.

630
00:42:54,238 --> 00:42:55,865
Rose. That's me?

631
00:43:30,174 --> 00:43:31,539
Oh, no!

632
00:44:51,955 --> 00:44:52,979
How is it?

633
00:44:54,425 --> 00:44:55,585
Chocolate!

634
00:45:29,626 --> 00:45:33,289
Do you think the roses
will mutate because of how we grow them?

635
00:45:35,666 --> 00:45:36,690
Yes,

636
00:45:38,702 --> 00:45:40,192
they'll become...

637
00:45:40,404 --> 00:45:41,871
"Man-eating plants"!

638
00:45:48,145 --> 00:45:49,669
Listen!

639
00:45:54,284 --> 00:45:55,410
Stop right there!

640
00:46:04,161 --> 00:46:06,026
I couldn't hit you on Earth,

641
00:46:06,130 --> 00:46:08,894
but don't believe
that I can't hit you in space.

642
00:46:09,666 --> 00:46:11,293
Come on, get me!

643
00:46:11,368 --> 00:46:13,666
Slow down, let me get you!

644
00:47:34,318 --> 00:47:37,014
There's a brand-new toothbrush
and toothpaste in the bathroom.

645
00:47:37,387 --> 00:47:39,116
I'll make breakfast.

646
00:47:39,223 --> 00:47:40,212
Thanks.

647
00:47:41,058 --> 00:47:42,821
It's the green toothbrush.

648
00:47:43,460 --> 00:47:44,449
Got it.

649
00:47:52,870 --> 00:47:54,929
One, two, three!

650
00:47:59,476 --> 00:48:02,411
Good morning, Mr. Bear, how are you?

651
00:48:02,479 --> 00:48:06,472
You ask how much I love you...

652
00:48:06,583 --> 00:48:07,845
What's up!

653
00:48:08,552 --> 00:48:09,610
Oh, shit!

654
00:48:19,630 --> 00:48:21,962
Johnny, you okay?

655
00:48:22,199 --> 00:48:24,633
I'm okay! Just brushing my teeth!

656
00:48:35,479 --> 00:48:36,810
Johnny?

657
00:48:40,250 --> 00:48:41,774
Sorry, my friend!

658
00:48:43,287 --> 00:48:44,276
Bye.

659
00:48:44,421 --> 00:48:45,649
What're you doing?

660
00:48:46,890 --> 00:48:48,187
No problem.

661
00:48:53,730 --> 00:48:54,856
What are you doing?

662
00:48:56,900 --> 00:48:59,733
What's going on? Open the door.

663
00:49:00,003 --> 00:49:01,732
Hold on...

664
00:49:02,139 --> 00:49:03,936
Open the door, please!
What are you doing?

665
00:49:06,877 --> 00:49:07,901
Open up!

666
00:49:08,011 --> 00:49:10,002
-I'm still brushing my teeth!
-What's going on?

667
00:49:12,816 --> 00:49:13,805
Wait!

668
00:49:14,351 --> 00:49:15,750
Open the door! I'm coming in!

669
00:49:15,852 --> 00:49:16,876
One!

670
00:49:17,487 --> 00:49:18,545
Two!

671
00:49:19,856 --> 00:49:20,845
Three!!

672
00:49:36,106 --> 00:49:39,940
Excuse me, shall we have breakfast now?

673
00:49:43,914 --> 00:49:44,938
Lovely!

674
00:49:57,094 --> 00:49:58,083
Let's eat!

675
00:50:02,466 --> 00:50:05,867
"Downside up",
the world looks so much better!

676
00:50:25,121 --> 00:50:26,486
You like to draw?

677
00:50:27,623 --> 00:50:29,352
I came here to study art,

678
00:50:31,293 --> 00:50:32,453
but I gave up.

679
00:50:32,528 --> 00:50:33,620
Why?

680
00:50:33,696 --> 00:50:35,357
Because of my fear.

681
00:50:35,431 --> 00:50:39,925
I felt that the paint is very dirty, so l...

682
00:50:41,771 --> 00:50:42,760
Lily.

683
00:50:43,305 --> 00:50:44,863
Trust me, you'll finish it for sure.

684
00:50:46,642 --> 00:50:47,973
I wish you success.

685
00:50:48,577 --> 00:50:49,566
Cheers...

686
00:50:51,747 --> 00:50:53,237
What's that sound?

687
00:50:54,917 --> 00:50:55,941
There is no sound!

688
00:50:56,018 --> 00:50:57,212
I heard a sound!

689
00:50:57,319 --> 00:50:58,547
What sound?!

690
00:51:05,027 --> 00:51:06,187
What's that?

691
00:51:17,239 --> 00:51:18,365
Thank you.

692
00:51:20,176 --> 00:51:21,165
What're you doing here?

693
00:51:21,243 --> 00:51:23,370
The "Full Moon in Paris"
shoot has been advanced...

694
00:51:24,613 --> 00:51:26,342
We gotta get out of here,
there are paparazzi outside.

695
00:51:26,449 --> 00:51:27,882
-Paparazzi?
-Hurry!

696
00:51:27,983 --> 00:51:29,041
Go!

697
00:51:33,622 --> 00:51:34,680
Wen Feng.

698
00:51:35,257 --> 00:51:37,157
Something serious has happened at home,
I have to go now...

699
00:51:37,259 --> 00:51:38,248
Sure. Leave everything to me.

700
00:51:38,360 --> 00:51:39,349
Then I'll see you tomorrow.

701
00:51:39,428 --> 00:51:42,022
See you.

702
00:51:42,097 --> 00:51:43,428
I will never be back.

703
00:51:44,567 --> 00:51:45,659
A coffee for table number 6.

704
00:51:45,734 --> 00:51:46,928
Let's go!

705
00:52:21,804 --> 00:52:23,465
Cut! Switch the props!

706
00:52:25,341 --> 00:52:26,831
Let me!

707
00:52:45,127 --> 00:52:47,755
Xiao Huang, is your new job going well?

708
00:52:48,864 --> 00:52:50,889
I didn't come here
with the intention to wait.

709
00:52:51,100 --> 00:52:52,658
I was just passing by.

710
00:52:58,274 --> 00:53:01,334
Right, I did come here to wait for you.

711
00:53:03,379 --> 00:53:04,505
I miss you.

712
00:53:05,648 --> 00:53:07,479
Call time tomorrow is 3 am.

713
00:53:08,050 --> 00:53:09,312
Go home and get some rest.

714
00:53:13,689 --> 00:53:14,917
Stop the car, Uncle Hua!

715
00:53:17,560 --> 00:53:18,584
Watermelon boy!

716
00:53:21,664 --> 00:53:22,926
He's still waiting for me.

717
00:53:23,532 --> 00:53:25,261
How do you know he's waiting for you?

718
00:53:27,303 --> 00:53:28,793
I lied and said that I lived here.

719
00:53:30,205 --> 00:53:32,173
Peony...!

720
00:53:32,308 --> 00:53:34,003
Don't say I didn't warn you.

721
00:53:34,343 --> 00:53:36,607
Your contract with
the management clearly states

722
00:53:36,745 --> 00:53:38,303
that you cannot fall in love for five years.

723
00:53:38,380 --> 00:53:39,369
Let me go!

724
00:53:39,481 --> 00:53:40,539
You can't get out of this car!

725
00:53:40,683 --> 00:53:43,208
You are Peony right now, not Xiao Huang!

726
00:53:43,385 --> 00:53:45,683
Peony,

727
00:53:46,221 --> 00:53:47,745
be professional.

728
00:53:55,831 --> 00:53:57,355
Uncle Hua, let's go!

729
00:54:22,925 --> 00:54:24,449
Rose.

730
00:54:27,396 --> 00:54:30,661
Rose.

731
00:54:33,235 --> 00:54:35,203
Let's start again?

732
00:54:36,071 --> 00:54:37,470
Fine.

733
00:54:53,756 --> 00:54:56,350
Michael, some things...

734
00:54:57,860 --> 00:55:00,158
I wish you would say it again

735
00:55:00,763 --> 00:55:03,027
when you're wide awake.

736
00:55:24,186 --> 00:55:27,019
You were talking in your sleep all night.
It kept me awake.

737
00:55:29,191 --> 00:55:31,921
Really? What did I say?

738
00:55:33,195 --> 00:55:34,662
You asked me a question.

739
00:55:34,897 --> 00:55:36,330
What was your answer?

740
00:55:42,204 --> 00:55:43,193
What's wrong?

741
00:55:43,405 --> 00:55:45,737
Warning! System failure.

742
00:55:45,908 --> 00:55:47,307
Initiate the backup system.

743
00:55:48,744 --> 00:55:50,905
Unresponsive! Oxygen levels down.
Air pressure down!

744
00:55:51,013 --> 00:55:52,480
Switch to manual operation.

745
00:55:54,249 --> 00:55:56,911
Still unresponsive!
Oxygen levels still down.

746
00:55:57,052 --> 00:55:58,610
We only have 4 minutes
and 33 seconds left!

747
00:55:58,687 --> 00:56:00,552
Shut down the entire main system. Reboot.

748
00:56:00,656 --> 00:56:01,816
What if it doesn't work?

749
00:56:01,890 --> 00:56:03,221
That's dangerous! We can't risk it!

750
00:56:03,292 --> 00:56:04,281
You have any other solution?

751
00:56:04,359 --> 00:56:06,020
Evacuate from the main cabin
to the backup cabin.

752
00:56:06,095 --> 00:56:07,687
We must initiate
the return procedures to Earth.

753
00:56:07,763 --> 00:56:09,890
No! That would mean
abandoning the entire mission.

754
00:56:09,965 --> 00:56:11,592
What good is the mission if we're dead?

755
00:56:11,667 --> 00:56:12,656
Shut off the main system!

756
00:56:12,735 --> 00:56:14,225
-Evacuate the cabin!
-Shut it off!

757
00:56:14,303 --> 00:56:15,327
-Evacuate the cabin!
-Shut it off!

758
00:56:15,437 --> 00:56:17,428
-Evacuate!
-This is an order!

759
00:56:18,540 --> 00:56:20,440
It's the wrong order!

760
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:26,744
Backup system in operation.

761
00:56:30,352 --> 00:56:32,946
Oxygen normal, air pressure normal.

762
00:56:33,088 --> 00:56:35,113
Backup system fully activated.

763
00:56:43,365 --> 00:56:44,491
How is it?

764
00:56:45,601 --> 00:56:46,659
Not bad.

765
00:56:47,102 --> 00:56:49,297
You're getting close to
professional restaurant standards.

766
00:56:49,605 --> 00:56:51,368
That means I can cook for Peony.

767
00:56:51,473 --> 00:56:52,462
Of course!

768
00:56:52,608 --> 00:56:54,769
She has such picky tastes.

769
00:56:56,912 --> 00:57:01,576
Call it a celebration for my promotion
to the position of a chef.

770
00:57:01,683 --> 00:57:02,911
Cheers...

771
00:57:08,524 --> 00:57:09,684
Uncle Hua,

772
00:57:10,492 --> 00:57:13,928
why did you stay single all these years?

773
00:57:14,897 --> 00:57:18,230
Back then... I missed my chance...

774
00:57:23,839 --> 00:57:24,828
Have some more...

775
00:57:28,277 --> 00:57:29,642
Okay, take it easy.

776
00:57:30,779 --> 00:57:37,343
Love is like taking a train.

777
00:57:37,986 --> 00:57:42,047
You think that there will be
another one soon after,

778
00:57:42,558 --> 00:57:43,547
right?

779
00:57:44,059 --> 00:57:49,156
So you hang around on the platform.

780
00:57:49,331 --> 00:57:53,199
But you never expected that the last one

781
00:57:53,435 --> 00:57:55,630
was actually the very last train.

782
00:57:56,205 --> 00:57:58,036
Back then, their father

783
00:57:58,140 --> 00:58:00,836
wanted to build his business
from scratch abroad.

784
00:58:01,577 --> 00:58:03,807
I went to the airport to see him off

785
00:58:04,613 --> 00:58:06,945
and was planning to break up with him.

786
00:58:07,049 --> 00:58:10,644
But I never would think
that he would say those lines to me.

787
00:58:10,786 --> 00:58:12,981
It was critical

788
00:58:13,088 --> 00:58:16,819
and the right timing.

789
00:58:16,959 --> 00:58:20,588
I didn't think much
and left together with him.

790
00:58:25,801 --> 00:58:30,465
So I say, if you've met the love of your life,

791
00:58:30,672 --> 00:58:34,631
don't miss your chance. Understand?

792
00:58:35,677 --> 00:58:37,076
You get it?

793
00:58:51,026 --> 00:58:53,324
I didn't drink for a while;

794
00:58:54,029 --> 00:58:57,226
I feel that I'm drunk.
May I get you some rice?

795
00:58:57,399 --> 00:58:59,663
Actually, I've kept it
in my heart for quite a while.

796
00:59:01,003 --> 00:59:02,834
Are you crazy?

797
00:59:03,138 --> 00:59:05,538
Just now... didn't you say...
don't miss your chance?

798
00:59:07,709 --> 00:59:08,733
Sorry...

799
00:59:11,213 --> 00:59:12,202
Sorry...

800
00:59:15,851 --> 00:59:17,512
Where are you taking me?

801
00:59:17,753 --> 00:59:19,220
Let's just go for a ride.

802
00:59:20,055 --> 00:59:21,352
In this car?

803
00:59:25,894 --> 00:59:27,953
No... No you're kidding me!

804
00:59:28,063 --> 00:59:31,123
Lily, I've done some research online...

805
00:59:32,634 --> 00:59:38,129
You may be cured if you confront
your fear head on.

806
00:59:38,273 --> 00:59:41,970
Get in this truck,
and that'll be your first step to recovery.

807
00:59:42,511 --> 00:59:45,503
Johnny, did you ever think that

808
00:59:46,248 --> 00:59:47,647
many problems could be resolved

809
00:59:47,716 --> 00:59:49,843
if you quit your job?

810
00:59:51,920 --> 00:59:53,319
It's... Chen & son.

811
00:59:56,158 --> 00:59:59,389
"Chen" is my dad, and "Son" is me.

812
01:00:00,696 --> 01:00:02,664
There's no "s" at the end of "son".

813
01:00:03,165 --> 01:00:05,793
He's just had a heart operation.

814
01:00:06,301 --> 01:00:07,791
My dad only has me.

815
01:00:09,938 --> 01:00:13,203
Besides, since I was little
I've always wanted

816
01:00:13,308 --> 01:00:15,868
to take the family business
beyond Chinatown.

817
01:00:16,545 --> 01:00:19,708
Sorry. I'm too selfish.

818
01:00:19,881 --> 01:00:21,143
There's medication available
for your illness.

819
01:00:21,216 --> 01:00:22,683
I've tried it.

820
01:00:23,752 --> 01:00:24,946
After I take it,

821
01:00:25,020 --> 01:00:27,784
I want to jump whenever I stand
on a subway platform.

822
01:00:27,990 --> 01:00:29,924
The doctor said depression is a side effect,

823
01:00:30,759 --> 01:00:32,317
so I had to stop taking the medicine.

824
01:00:35,797 --> 01:00:40,166
No problem, I'll take a shower.

825
01:00:40,335 --> 01:00:41,996
Wait for me, I'll be quick!

826
01:00:42,604 --> 01:00:43,764
Johnny?

827
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:46,634
Don't come back!

828
01:00:47,242 --> 01:00:48,903
-What?
-Don't come back!

829
01:00:48,977 --> 01:00:50,911
Why? Wait.

830
01:00:51,013 --> 01:00:53,243
Lily, wait! Do we really have to give up?

831
01:00:57,185 --> 01:00:59,050
I don't want to be your burden.

832
01:01:00,255 --> 01:01:01,813
I'd be glad to carry it.

833
01:01:01,990 --> 01:01:03,821
But it'll just get heavier and heavier.

834
01:01:04,059 --> 01:01:05,048
Not a problem!

835
01:01:09,865 --> 01:01:10,854
How about this?

836
01:01:12,434 --> 01:01:15,733
We'll walk 100 steps away
from each other, back to back.

837
01:01:17,672 --> 01:01:21,130
If we turn around
and can still see each other,

838
01:01:22,010 --> 01:01:23,238
then I'll do whatever you say.

839
01:01:29,551 --> 01:01:30,540
It's a deal!

840
01:01:35,090 --> 01:01:42,053
One, two, three, four, five, six...

841
01:01:42,664 --> 01:01:45,690
Seven, eight, nine...

842
01:01:46,368 --> 01:01:51,203
Eleven, twelve, thirteen...

843
01:02:14,663 --> 01:02:17,791
Ninety-one, ninety-two,

844
01:02:19,468 --> 01:02:22,699
ninety-three, ninety-four...

845
01:02:23,605 --> 01:02:27,837
Ninety-five, ninety-six, ninety-seven,

846
01:02:28,210 --> 01:02:32,340
ninety-eight, ninety-nine, one hundred.

847
01:02:43,425 --> 01:02:44,449
Lily!

848
01:02:45,894 --> 01:02:47,088
Lily!

849
01:02:49,531 --> 01:02:50,964
Lily! I know you can hear me.

850
01:02:51,066 --> 01:02:53,660
You must believe me, Lily!
We'll definitely find a way.

851
01:02:53,735 --> 01:02:57,865
I love you! Give love a chance!

852
01:02:58,173 --> 01:03:00,573
I love you too but shut up!

853
01:03:05,480 --> 01:03:08,711
Lily!

854
01:03:09,184 --> 01:03:10,651
I love you!

855
01:03:11,119 --> 01:03:12,381
Lily!

856
01:03:31,506 --> 01:03:33,133
We're both Martians.

857
01:03:34,876 --> 01:03:36,207
Too competitive.

858
01:03:37,712 --> 01:03:39,270
Always wanting to win.

859
01:03:43,318 --> 01:03:45,684
Even if we didn't go to
the wrong meeting place that time,

860
01:03:46,755 --> 01:03:49,622
we'd still have broken up in the end.

861
01:03:52,327 --> 01:03:53,351
Good night.

862
01:05:39,234 --> 01:05:43,193
Feng, did you say that Xiao Huang

863
01:05:43,471 --> 01:05:47,430
got a new job and will not come back?

864
01:05:54,349 --> 01:05:55,611
Xiao Huang?

865
01:06:00,455 --> 01:06:04,323
Huang! You're off work this late?

866
01:06:05,827 --> 01:06:08,227
I came to ride home
on your watermelon cart.

867
01:06:11,433 --> 01:06:12,457
Thanks.

868
01:06:14,302 --> 01:06:15,291
No worries!

869
01:06:16,104 --> 01:06:18,072
Let's go, Xiao Huang!

870
01:06:22,711 --> 01:06:25,077
How have you been lately?

871
01:06:27,282 --> 01:06:28,271
Sit here.

872
01:06:35,557 --> 01:06:37,149
I recorded a song for you.

873
01:06:38,126 --> 01:06:39,957
You recorded a song for me?

874
01:06:40,528 --> 01:06:41,893
I recorded it at a karaoke.

875
01:06:42,797 --> 01:06:44,492
Great! I wanna listen to it.

876
01:07:05,286 --> 01:07:06,275
How do you like it?

877
01:07:06,721 --> 01:07:07,779
It's great!

878
01:07:08,623 --> 01:07:09,612
Let's go.

879
01:08:04,012 --> 01:08:05,001
It's beautiful!

880
01:08:07,015 --> 01:08:08,039
Here, it's for you.

881
01:08:10,084 --> 01:08:12,052
But you have to listen to it
all the way to the end.

882
01:08:15,857 --> 01:08:17,620
Is something troubling you,

883
01:08:17,959 --> 01:08:19,756
or are there problems at work?

884
01:08:19,894 --> 01:08:23,853
My new job is complicated.
You won't understand.

885
01:08:25,366 --> 01:08:27,266
I have to pretend to be happy
even if I'm not.

886
01:08:27,569 --> 01:08:29,434
Office work could be that complicated?

887
01:08:29,604 --> 01:08:30,901
Yes, sometimes I have to lie

888
01:08:31,639 --> 01:08:34,699
and have to say things
aren't true to how I feel...

889
01:08:35,176 --> 01:08:37,644
Then quit! No one likes liars!

890
01:08:40,215 --> 01:08:42,410
Sometimes you have to say
the opposite to what's on your mind.

891
01:08:42,517 --> 01:08:44,041
Why do you have to do that?

892
01:08:45,019 --> 01:08:48,648
Saying the opposite could be
our secret language.

893
01:08:48,790 --> 01:08:52,726
Like "l don't want to see you"
means "l miss you".

894
01:08:54,062 --> 01:08:56,462
"Go away" means "l need you".

895
01:08:58,833 --> 01:08:59,857
"l hate you" means...

896
01:09:01,336 --> 01:09:02,667
"l love you".

897
01:09:04,239 --> 01:09:08,471
Others may not understand,
but some will get it.

898
01:09:10,111 --> 01:09:11,100
Do you?

899
01:09:14,849 --> 01:09:16,146
Kind of!

900
01:09:17,418 --> 01:09:20,251
I will have my day off soon,
how about I take you out? Okay?

901
01:09:21,289 --> 01:09:22,483
I hate you!

902
01:09:23,758 --> 01:09:24,918
Hate me?

903
01:09:29,497 --> 01:09:31,158
Hating me means you love me!

904
01:09:38,973 --> 01:09:41,771
It's very late, so I'd better go.

905
01:09:46,481 --> 01:09:48,176
I know where to take you.

906
01:09:49,684 --> 01:09:52,152
We'll go to Lake Houhai and go rowing.

907
01:10:08,136 --> 01:10:09,467
Wen Feng!

908
01:10:11,272 --> 01:10:12,534
Wen Feng!

909
01:10:13,942 --> 01:10:15,170
Wen Feng!

910
01:10:15,977 --> 01:10:18,741
We won't see each other again!

911
01:10:21,282 --> 01:10:23,216
Forget about me!

912
01:10:34,529 --> 01:10:38,795
Wen Feng! I really hate you!

913
01:10:39,434 --> 01:10:42,835
I really hate you!

914
01:10:53,181 --> 01:10:55,911
You must believe me, Lily!
We'll definitely find a way.

915
01:10:55,984 --> 01:10:57,110
Give love a chance!

916
01:11:46,634 --> 01:11:48,158
I can do it!

917
01:11:57,311 --> 01:11:59,404
I can... I can...

918
01:12:01,449 --> 01:12:03,178
I can... I can...

919
01:13:05,313 --> 01:13:07,144
I know you just broke up,

920
01:13:07,348 --> 01:13:09,942
so I set up a date for you
with Dim Sum King's daughter.

921
01:13:10,051 --> 01:13:11,313
You can't be serious!

922
01:13:11,853 --> 01:13:15,050
God made a joke to have you meet
this OCD girl...

923
01:13:15,323 --> 01:13:16,688
Dad, stop it...

924
01:13:16,858 --> 01:13:19,156
Your mom and I met via matchmaking too.

925
01:13:21,629 --> 01:13:23,927
-Look, that's her.
-Barbecued Pork Bun...

926
01:13:23,998 --> 01:13:25,556
-Who?
-Go talk to her!

927
01:13:25,700 --> 01:13:27,065
Barbecued Pork Bun...

928
01:13:28,536 --> 01:13:31,164
-Uncle!
-Bunny, he's my son.

929
01:13:31,272 --> 01:13:32,796
I know!

930
01:13:33,341 --> 01:13:35,104
When we close up each night,

931
01:13:35,176 --> 01:13:37,371
I sometimes peep through the windows
and watch him collect garbage.

932
01:13:37,512 --> 01:13:38,809
Watch me?

933
01:13:40,314 --> 01:13:41,406
Want a bun?

934
01:13:43,751 --> 01:13:47,084
See! You will make a good couple!
Give me five!

935
01:13:52,493 --> 01:13:53,687
Johnny! I...

936
01:13:55,563 --> 01:13:56,552
Sorry...

937
01:14:02,837 --> 01:14:05,328
Johnny! I know you're here!

938
01:14:05,439 --> 01:14:07,339
I found you finally! I...

939
01:14:07,408 --> 01:14:08,397
-Lily.
-Johnny.

940
01:14:08,476 --> 01:14:09,943
I agree with you.

941
01:14:10,011 --> 01:14:12,605
We'll go to the movies instead of bowling.

942
01:14:12,747 --> 01:14:15,580
Let's go.

943
01:14:18,052 --> 01:14:22,182
Lily! Lily! Wait! Lily... Please wait!

944
01:14:25,960 --> 01:14:27,655
There's no need to explain,

945
01:14:28,129 --> 01:14:29,721
we're not together anymore.

946
01:14:32,133 --> 01:14:35,762
She's lovely. I wish you two the best.

947
01:14:35,937 --> 01:14:37,404
No, please wait! Wait!

948
01:14:40,741 --> 01:14:42,641
Were you looking for me for something?

949
01:15:08,035 --> 01:15:09,229
Uncle Hua.

950
01:15:09,470 --> 01:15:10,562
Good morning.

951
01:15:10,638 --> 01:15:11,627
Good morning.

952
01:15:11,706 --> 01:15:13,367
I made too many dumplings yesterday,

953
01:15:13,441 --> 01:15:16,205
and I couldn't finish them.
So I brought you some.

954
01:15:16,577 --> 01:15:19,011
Thanks... about that day...

955
01:15:19,714 --> 01:15:20,806
I don't remember a thing.

956
01:15:20,882 --> 01:15:22,110
Can I still teach you how to cook?

957
01:15:22,183 --> 01:15:25,050
Of course. I still have lots to learn.

958
01:15:30,057 --> 01:15:32,719
What's up? Still missing your Xiao Huang?

959
01:15:34,195 --> 01:15:36,288
No... just stressed about money.

960
01:15:36,497 --> 01:15:38,658
Look at you...

961
01:15:38,799 --> 01:15:40,391
Just Listen.

962
01:15:40,468 --> 01:15:43,062
There's a freelance job tomorrow.
$200 a day. Want to go?

963
01:15:44,906 --> 01:15:45,895
Yes, I'll go.

964
01:15:46,507 --> 01:15:49,476
"Full Moon in Paris"
Scene 100, shot 1, take 1.

965
01:15:51,712 --> 01:15:52,701
Action!

966
01:16:21,976 --> 01:16:23,170
Xiao Huang?

967
01:16:31,686 --> 01:16:32,744
You're Xiao Huang?!

968
01:16:33,287 --> 01:16:34,311
Cut!

969
01:16:34,388 --> 01:16:36,481
What is that extra doing?! Get out of here!

970
01:16:38,259 --> 01:16:39,317
I'm Xiao Huang,

971
01:16:41,195 --> 01:16:42,719
but I'm also Peony Huang.

972
01:16:44,465 --> 01:16:45,932
Who's that guy?

973
01:16:48,769 --> 01:16:50,168
Why did you lie to me?

974
01:16:50,338 --> 01:16:52,135
I wanted to tell you myself,

975
01:16:52,873 --> 01:16:54,670
but I didn't have the courage.

976
01:16:58,412 --> 01:17:00,676
You're not Xiao Huang,
you're Peony Huang.

977
01:17:02,216 --> 01:17:03,547
Who is that guy?

978
01:17:04,452 --> 01:17:05,476
I don't know.

979
01:17:05,553 --> 01:17:06,850
You lied to me!

980
01:17:12,326 --> 01:17:13,418
Wen Feng!

981
01:17:14,628 --> 01:17:16,186
Peony...

982
01:17:17,531 --> 01:17:19,522
Guys... Guys, stop...

983
01:17:32,413 --> 01:17:33,607
Wen Feng!

984
01:17:41,389 --> 01:17:43,220
SSD1. Check.

985
01:17:43,758 --> 01:17:45,589
SSD2. Check.

986
01:17:47,795 --> 01:17:50,389
I hope tomorrow's space mission
will go smoothly.

987
01:17:50,464 --> 01:17:53,729
I hope the command center can find
the problem very quickly.

988
01:17:54,802 --> 01:17:58,363
It's dangerous every time
we go out there, right?

989
01:17:59,840 --> 01:18:03,674
Don't worry,
only one out of seven astronauts die.

990
01:18:03,778 --> 01:18:07,179
We are less than 3.5 astronauts here,
so it should be okay.

991
01:18:16,824 --> 01:18:19,850
Look, they bloomed!

992
01:18:25,499 --> 01:18:26,864
Roses without thorns.

993
01:18:28,836 --> 01:18:31,999
A rose is not a rose without any thorns.

994
01:19:05,940 --> 01:19:07,066
Excuse me, mate.

995
01:19:07,141 --> 01:19:08,335
Yes?

996
01:19:08,476 --> 01:19:11,445
Sorry, but do you know
where Lily is please?

997
01:19:11,512 --> 01:19:14,845
Lily? She left, back to her family.

998
01:19:15,082 --> 01:19:16,549
Boss, you want that painting there?

999
01:19:16,650 --> 01:19:17,742
No, that's garbage.

1000
01:19:17,885 --> 01:19:18,874
Alright.

1001
01:19:19,520 --> 01:19:21,351
Hold on, do you mind if I take a look?

1002
01:19:21,455 --> 01:19:22,479
Sure, no problem.

1003
01:19:22,556 --> 01:19:23,545
Thanks.

1004
01:20:58,619 --> 01:21:01,452
Commencing reconnection.
Be careful. Confirm?

1005
01:21:01,589 --> 01:21:03,113
Copy that. Confirm.

1006
01:21:04,058 --> 01:21:07,050
It doesn't work, let me try again? Confirm?

1007
01:21:08,262 --> 01:21:09,422
Okay, confirm.

1008
01:21:14,535 --> 01:21:15,763
Rose!

1009
01:21:15,836 --> 01:21:17,133
Michael!

1010
01:21:19,940 --> 01:21:21,407
Michael!

1011
01:21:22,176 --> 01:21:23,643
Don't come over!

1012
01:21:26,981 --> 01:21:28,039
No!

1013
01:21:30,417 --> 01:21:31,441
Rose.

1014
01:21:32,386 --> 01:21:33,375
Michael.

1015
01:21:33,454 --> 01:21:34,443
Listen,

1016
01:21:35,990 --> 01:21:37,821
I'm sending you back.

1017
01:21:38,993 --> 01:21:39,982
No!

1018
01:21:41,061 --> 01:21:42,153
No!

1019
01:21:43,797 --> 01:21:45,788
No!

1020
01:21:51,672 --> 01:21:53,640
Michael!

1021
01:21:55,609 --> 01:21:57,474
Michael!

1022
01:22:00,080 --> 01:22:01,707
Michael!

1023
01:22:10,624 --> 01:22:12,524
Michael, can you hear me?

1024
01:22:13,093 --> 01:22:16,859
Michael, come back to me...

1025
01:22:17,064 --> 01:22:18,861
There must be a way...

1026
01:22:19,733 --> 01:22:20,893
No, there isn't.

1027
01:22:21,602 --> 01:22:22,830
Rose,

1028
01:22:23,804 --> 01:22:26,136
-listen to me...
-No, listen to me.

1029
01:22:26,607 --> 01:22:28,802
You get back here!

1030
01:22:28,909 --> 01:22:30,877
You have to fight with me...

1031
01:22:32,179 --> 01:22:33,703
even now?

1032
01:22:37,518 --> 01:22:39,349
I have to tell you...

1033
01:22:40,754 --> 01:22:42,779
I really want to get back with you.

1034
01:22:43,757 --> 01:22:46,453
Michael, what did you want to say?
Say it again.

1035
01:22:47,528 --> 01:22:49,792
I really want to get back with you.

1036
01:22:50,764 --> 01:22:52,391
I can't hear you!

1037
01:22:52,933 --> 01:22:55,697
Michael!

1038
01:22:56,103 --> 01:22:58,333
What did you say? Please say it again!

1039
01:22:59,940 --> 01:23:03,740
Michael, please repeat!

1040
01:23:04,745 --> 01:23:06,872
I don't want to lose you, Michael!

1041
01:23:06,980 --> 01:23:08,538
Michael!

1042
01:23:09,149 --> 01:23:14,712
Michael!
I don't want to lose you, Michael!

1043
01:23:19,493 --> 01:23:22,621
I have a solution! Michael, listen!

1044
01:23:23,364 --> 01:23:26,231
Pump all the oxygen into your suit,

1045
01:23:26,367 --> 01:23:27,959
and it'll give you three minutes to breathe.

1046
01:23:28,035 --> 01:23:30,094
Then unplug the oxygen tank
from the outside,

1047
01:23:30,204 --> 01:23:32,434
and the oxygen that flies out
should propel you back!

1048
01:23:33,307 --> 01:23:34,740
Do you copy?

1049
01:23:34,908 --> 01:23:36,500
Can you hear me?

1050
01:23:37,010 --> 01:23:40,173
Michael... answer me.

1051
01:23:41,448 --> 01:23:43,245
I don't want to lose you!

1052
01:23:43,350 --> 01:23:45,944
I don't want to be alone, Michael!

1053
01:23:46,854 --> 01:23:50,847
I want to cook for you, do laundry for you...

1054
01:23:52,226 --> 01:23:54,786
when the light bulb dies,
I need you to change it for me.

1055
01:23:54,862 --> 01:23:59,822
When I'm hungry at night,
I need you to cook me noodles.

1056
01:24:01,368 --> 01:24:06,533
I just want you to come back!

1057
01:24:08,075 --> 01:24:10,134
I need you...

1058
01:24:24,691 --> 01:24:28,491
Michael!

1059
01:24:38,038 --> 01:24:39,903
Michael, wake up!

1060
01:24:42,276 --> 01:24:43,709
Please, wake up!!!

1061
01:24:56,023 --> 01:25:00,460
I am here... Michael, I'm right here.

1062
01:25:01,995 --> 01:25:03,326
Rose.

1063
01:25:06,600 --> 01:25:10,297
You can't die; you need to take care of me.

1064
01:25:11,205 --> 01:25:12,604
Give me a chance...

1065
01:25:14,942 --> 01:25:15,966
For?

1066
01:25:17,711 --> 01:25:20,509
Give me a chance to change your light bulb,

1067
01:25:21,114 --> 01:25:24,948
to cook you instant noodles.

1068
01:25:25,552 --> 01:25:26,746
And with me around...

1069
01:25:28,422 --> 01:25:30,083
I won't let you cry anymore...

1070
01:25:39,833 --> 01:25:41,460
I will take you as my wife!

1071
01:25:46,907 --> 01:25:48,534
No, I mean please take me as your wife.

1072
01:25:52,980 --> 01:25:54,106
Excellent.

1073
01:26:53,707 --> 01:26:56,335
Hello, sir. Where are you going?

1074
01:26:58,145 --> 01:27:01,603
I'm not familiar with this place,
please take a look.

1075
01:27:01,782 --> 01:27:03,010
-Okay.
-Thanks!

1076
01:27:03,116 --> 01:27:04,640
Chianti, got it!

1077
01:27:14,995 --> 01:27:16,053
Pierre.

1078
01:27:17,164 --> 01:27:19,064
My longing for you is like a poison,

1079
01:27:19,533 --> 01:27:21,626
slowly eroding my heart away.

1080
01:27:36,216 --> 01:27:39,151
Cheer up! You're still missing Xiao Huang?

1081
01:27:39,753 --> 01:27:42,221
She's not Xiao Huang, she's Peony Huang.

1082
01:27:42,356 --> 01:27:45,484
On the pink cell phone
that Xiao Huang gave you...

1083
01:27:45,626 --> 01:27:50,086
she recorded a... confession.

1084
01:27:51,398 --> 01:27:52,831
It gave me goose bumps!

1085
01:27:52,899 --> 01:27:55,265
Come again? A confession?

1086
01:27:55,402 --> 01:27:57,370
Creepy!

1087
01:27:58,038 --> 01:27:59,096
It's beautiful.

1088
01:27:59,172 --> 01:28:00,196
Here, it's for you.

1089
01:28:02,275 --> 01:28:03,640
You have to listen to it
all the way to the end.

1090
01:28:03,710 --> 01:28:06,702
You're not Xiao Huang,
you're Peony Huang.

1091
01:28:06,880 --> 01:28:08,745
I've told you...
it's recorded at the end of the song.

1092
01:28:08,815 --> 01:28:09,839
Please, trust me...

1093
01:28:09,916 --> 01:28:11,383
You lied to me!

1094
01:28:11,585 --> 01:28:13,917
You didn't listen to the end, right?
Want to hear it now?

1095
01:28:16,523 --> 01:28:17,615
Give me back the phone?

1096
01:28:20,594 --> 01:28:22,858
Can I borrow your shoulder?

1097
01:28:41,081 --> 01:28:42,605
May l, too?

1098
01:28:50,090 --> 01:28:52,285
Wen Feng, go get her!

1099
01:29:02,335 --> 01:29:04,826
Pay attention, call up everyone.

1100
01:29:04,971 --> 01:29:07,439
Meeting outside Peony Huang's house,
get ready for live broadcast.

1101
01:29:11,244 --> 01:29:14,111
If I didn't have the courage
to tell you tonight,

1102
01:29:14,948 --> 01:29:17,178
then I hope you would listen
to this recording.

1103
01:29:17,751 --> 01:29:19,150
I am Xiao Huang,

1104
01:29:20,854 --> 01:29:22,446
but I am also Peony Huang.

1105
01:29:23,256 --> 01:29:27,056
I've been lying to you
since the day I met you.

1106
01:29:27,294 --> 01:29:29,455
To become a good actor,

1107
01:29:29,563 --> 01:29:31,656
I wanted to experience life in a cafe.

1108
01:29:31,732 --> 01:29:35,668
I thought a week or two
wouldn't hurt anybody,

1109
01:29:35,736 --> 01:29:38,466
but I didn't realize that my time with you

1110
01:29:39,506 --> 01:29:43,465
would be so real, so unforgettable.

1111
01:29:44,211 --> 01:29:45,269
Wen Feng,

1112
01:29:46,113 --> 01:29:47,205
I'm sorry.

1113
01:29:47,514 --> 01:29:48,538
Hell!

1114
01:29:50,484 --> 01:29:51,815
Can you forgive me?

1115
01:29:53,153 --> 01:29:54,347
I'm sorry.

1116
01:30:02,429 --> 01:30:03,794
Forgive me.

1117
01:30:05,832 --> 01:30:08,130
Hello, this is Henry from CEN.

1118
01:30:08,201 --> 01:30:09,395
I am going to bring you
some exclusive news.

1119
01:30:09,503 --> 01:30:11,368
Today, our "cafe hero", Wen Feng,

1120
01:30:11,438 --> 01:30:13,201
will put aside all worldly burdens

1121
01:30:13,306 --> 01:30:15,570
and will reveal his love
to movie star Peony Huang.

1122
01:30:15,709 --> 01:30:17,438
Will their fairytale love story

1123
01:30:17,544 --> 01:30:20,104
survive despite
their radically different social classes?

1124
01:30:20,180 --> 01:30:22,842
Will it have a happy ending?

1125
01:30:23,116 --> 01:30:26,449
Stay tuned, stay with CEN,
stay with Henry.

1126
01:30:36,496 --> 01:30:38,396
What are you two doing?

1127
01:31:10,030 --> 01:31:11,019
Sir, excuse me...

1128
01:31:12,699 --> 01:31:14,064
is this address here?

1129
01:31:16,603 --> 01:31:17,900
I'm going there too.

1130
01:31:18,905 --> 01:31:20,236
You are...

1131
01:31:23,376 --> 01:31:24,866
I'm looking for Peony Huang!

1132
01:31:26,847 --> 01:31:28,405
I'm looking for her older sister.

1133
01:31:32,118 --> 01:31:33,585
-Okay!
-Right!

1134
01:31:33,887 --> 01:31:35,684
Are you here to say something to Peony?

1135
01:31:35,789 --> 01:31:38,781
Tell us, just a bit...

1136
01:31:45,532 --> 01:31:47,932
Any good shows on TV?

1137
01:31:49,603 --> 01:31:51,935
Don't go... Just a bit...

1138
01:31:53,940 --> 01:31:55,635
Breaking news?

1139
01:31:59,546 --> 01:32:01,207
Isn't this outside our house?

1140
01:32:01,314 --> 01:32:02,872
Hello, this is reporter Henry.

1141
01:32:03,016 --> 01:32:04,074
You will witness with us

1142
01:32:04,150 --> 01:32:06,311
Mr. Coffee's declaration to Peony Huang.

1143
01:32:06,453 --> 01:32:07,818
Look, here's our Mr. Coffee!

1144
01:32:07,921 --> 01:32:09,218
Mr. Coffee, our cafe hero!

1145
01:32:09,289 --> 01:32:10,517
Come, tell us!

1146
01:32:15,829 --> 01:32:19,026
Just speak from your heart simply.
Come on!

1147
01:32:19,933 --> 01:32:21,161
You first!

1148
01:32:22,369 --> 01:32:23,666
-Johnny.
-Wen Feng.

1149
01:32:24,437 --> 01:32:25,426
Okay.

1150
01:32:26,773 --> 01:32:28,502
Who are they?

1151
01:32:29,242 --> 01:32:30,266
Lily.

1152
01:32:32,579 --> 01:32:34,137
I want to tell you that

1153
01:32:34,281 --> 01:32:38,308
I don't mind taking three showers
before each date,

1154
01:32:38,718 --> 01:32:40,913
brushing my teeth before kissing you,

1155
01:32:41,388 --> 01:32:43,720
and giving up my family business for you.

1156
01:32:43,990 --> 01:32:46,254
Ifthe distance between us is 100 steps,

1157
01:32:47,127 --> 01:32:49,220
I'm willing to walk 99 first,

1158
01:32:50,063 --> 01:32:52,657
and then wait for you to take that last step.

1159
01:32:52,766 --> 01:32:55,860
I'm willing to wait as long as it takes,

1160
01:32:58,338 --> 01:32:59,464
because I love you!

1161
01:33:03,576 --> 01:33:05,771
Oh dear... darling!

1162
01:33:08,915 --> 01:33:09,973
I got it!

1163
01:33:13,420 --> 01:33:14,512
Go get her!

1164
01:33:14,821 --> 01:33:15,810
What?

1165
01:33:16,957 --> 01:33:17,981
Go!

1166
01:33:23,630 --> 01:33:27,498
Huang, I've listened to your recording.

1167
01:33:28,568 --> 01:33:31,435
I was wrong for yelling at you that day.

1168
01:33:32,238 --> 01:33:33,637
I misunderstood you.

1169
01:33:35,342 --> 01:33:36,331
Look!

1170
01:33:36,843 --> 01:33:38,504
I've brought a nice sweet watermelon
for you.

1171
01:33:38,578 --> 01:33:41,411
Please accept my apology.

1172
01:33:44,617 --> 01:33:47,017
My thoughts are everywhere;

1173
01:33:47,921 --> 01:33:49,548
my love for you knows no bounds,

1174
01:33:51,191 --> 01:33:52,954
whether drunk or sober,

1175
01:33:53,126 --> 01:33:55,856
at home or elsewhere...

1176
01:33:56,529 --> 01:33:59,327
Keep it simple. We don't understand.

1177
01:34:04,804 --> 01:34:07,534
Huang, listen!

1178
01:34:09,943 --> 01:34:10,967
I really...

1179
01:34:12,846 --> 01:34:14,143
"Hate you"!

1180
01:34:21,788 --> 01:34:22,812
Here she is!

1181
01:34:22,889 --> 01:34:23,981
Peony is here!

1182
01:34:28,762 --> 01:34:29,751
Huang!

1183
01:34:31,898 --> 01:34:33,627
I hate you too!

1184
01:34:59,526 --> 01:35:00,891
I love you, Lily...

1185
01:35:13,706 --> 01:35:15,469
I love you more!

1186
01:35:33,460 --> 01:35:34,654
Sorry...

1187
01:36:35,388 --> 01:36:37,288
Go ahead, try!

1188
01:36:38,591 --> 01:36:41,822
Mom, we are grateful to have
this first ever meal by you.

1189
01:36:42,162 --> 01:36:43,288
Thanks, darling!

1190
01:36:43,496 --> 01:36:45,123
It must be better than Chinatown.

1191
01:36:45,231 --> 01:36:47,597
If you like my cooking,
I will cook every day from now on!

1192
01:36:47,667 --> 01:36:48,656
Super!

1193
01:36:48,735 --> 01:36:50,202
You are now a master.

1194
01:36:52,005 --> 01:36:53,632
After dinner, we can eat this watermelon.

1195
01:36:53,740 --> 01:36:54,934
It's crispy and sweet!

1196
01:36:55,041 --> 01:36:56,372
Fantastic!

1197
01:37:00,013 --> 01:37:02,243
Now we're only missing your big sis...

1198
01:37:09,622 --> 01:37:12,022
Big sis, come back soon for Mom's food.

1199
01:37:12,158 --> 01:37:14,319
We're all missing you!

1200
01:37:19,999 --> 01:37:24,629
My baby, come home soon, we miss you!

1201
01:38:08,715 --> 01:38:10,239
Mission accomplished!

1202
01:38:11,251 --> 01:38:12,775
Excellent!

1203
01:38:16,856 --> 01:38:18,448
Let's go home.

1204
01:38:20,226 --> 01:38:21,215
Confirmed!

1205
01:43:54,760 --> 01:43:55,749
