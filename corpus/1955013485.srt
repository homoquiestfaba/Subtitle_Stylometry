1
00:00:33,675 --> 00:00:36,086
Yes, it is actually confirmed.

2
00:00:36,421 --> 00:00:39,803
1.6 million dollar prize pool!

3
00:00:39,808 --> 00:00:42,206
I'm double-checking to make sure
they haven't changed any details

4
00:00:42,208 --> 00:00:43,303
since they told us last time.

5
00:00:43,308 --> 00:00:46,753
1 million in US dollars for First Prize.

6
00:00:46,769 --> 00:00:46,858
That is for the winner.

7
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:49,754
1 million dollars for winning Dota!

8
00:00:50,009 --> 00:00:51,450
It's going to be huge. Dota2.com

9
00:00:52,115 --> 00:00:54,120
The tournament tab is up, too.

10
00:00:54,166 --> 00:00:57,635
Our website will actually change
for the next 24 hours as well...

11
00:00:58,735 --> 00:01:02,392
The day I transformed into an adult was
the day I started playing Dota.

12
00:01:05,003 --> 00:01:07,842
It’s times like, when you
go up on the stage,

13
00:01:08,081 --> 00:01:10,323
you represent your country for something.

14
00:01:10,509 --> 00:01:11,530
You get the prize.

15
00:01:11,597 --> 00:01:14,663
It's the amount of satisfaction and
achievement that nothing else can give you.

16
00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:17,365
It's something I definitely
don't regret ever doing.

17
00:01:17,099 --> 00:01:20,104
Gaming is simply the proudest
thing in my life.

18
00:01:25,343 --> 00:01:29,397
It can be called "gamer," but for me,
it's something different.

19
00:01:30,432 --> 00:01:36,478
One way to forget about pain is to do
something that you will be in completely.

20
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:38,292
So

21
00:01:38,293 --> 00:01:39,980
computer games.

22
00:01:40,789 --> 00:01:43,008
For me, it was

23
00:01:43,008 --> 00:01:44,945
everything.

24
00:01:49,063 --> 00:01:50,288
This is my career.

25
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:52,804
I've chosen to do it for so long.

26
00:01:52,809 --> 00:01:56,851
Success in my eyes is always based
on how other people see you.

27
00:01:57,270 --> 00:01:58,611
In the eyes of the public,

28
00:01:58,066 --> 00:01:59,949
it's up to them.

29
00:02:05,548 --> 00:02:09,159
It's important to be doing things
that you love and you really appreciate.

30
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:10,084
Because that's your passion, man.

31
00:02:10,809 --> 00:02:13,948
You should really work for your passions.

32
00:02:14,353 --> 00:02:17,344
Ok, guys, you have 7 minutes
to set everything up

33
00:02:17,345 --> 00:02:18,350
and then we go.

34
00:02:18,011 --> 00:02:20,819
This is the first time I really
wanted to take something seriously

35
00:02:21,513 --> 00:02:24,004
and do something good for my life.

36
00:02:41,013 --> 00:02:45,015
10 years ago, competitive gaming
wasn't even really a thing.

37
00:02:46,010 --> 00:02:48,044
You would play for fun
against your friends.

38
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:51,831
Maybe you would play for a cup of coffee or
whatever you wanted.

39
00:02:52,209 --> 00:02:55,411
When I started playing,
we'd been fighting for

40
00:02:55,412 --> 00:02:57,686
24 bottles of beer as a first place.

41
00:02:58,173 --> 00:02:59,185
I'm not joking.

42
00:02:59,491 --> 00:03:02,005
From there, though, online happened.

43
00:03:02,006 --> 00:03:05,753
And, all of a sudden, you weren't
just trying to be the best on your block.

44
00:03:05,766 --> 00:03:07,587
Now you're trying to be the best
in the world.

45
00:03:07,588 --> 00:03:11,904
And that opened up competitive
gaming to a whole new landscape.

46
00:03:12,409 --> 00:03:15,434
And one of the games really
leading the way is Dota.

47
00:03:26,334 --> 00:03:30,627
Dota is sort of a combination of football
(or soccer for the Americans)

48
00:03:30,628 --> 00:03:31,662
and Chess.

49
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:35,005
This is probably how I would try
to explain Dota

50
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:37,405
to someone who's not familiar with it.

51
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:39,505
At least, that's what I did to my parents.

52
00:03:42,672 --> 00:03:44,651
Dota is a game of momentum.

53
00:03:44,746 --> 00:03:46,588
You as 5 players

54
00:03:46,589 --> 00:03:49,135
try and battle against the other
5 players for momentum.

55
00:03:49,822 --> 00:03:52,668
Every single player controls one unit.

56
00:03:52,684 --> 00:03:57,126
And the main objective of the game is
to destroy the final enemy building

57
00:03:57,131 --> 00:04:01,006
which is called the "Ancient."

58
00:04:03,845 --> 00:04:05,953
Everything else that happens
in the meantime

59
00:04:05,954 --> 00:04:07,960
is your amazing filler of a game.

60
00:04:10,353 --> 00:04:12,466
You could play 100 heroes

61
00:04:12,471 --> 00:04:14,567
in conjunction with 99 other heroes.

62
00:04:16,050 --> 00:04:18,081
It's just nonstop possibilities

63
00:04:18,761 --> 00:04:20,906
and it's so much fun.

64
00:04:21,011 --> 00:04:23,068
And you know, it's like the same
map every single time

65
00:04:23,452 --> 00:04:25,947
but it literally never gets boring.

66
00:04:27,189 --> 00:04:30,174
I would say Dota is a way of life.

67
00:04:33,011 --> 00:04:35,046
When the prizes started coming

68
00:04:35,857 --> 00:04:38,349
I was like, well we have tournaments

69
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:40,778
so obviously some people are going
to come and say,

70
00:04:40,779 --> 00:04:43,582
"This is a great game. Let's play it.
Like, let's put money in it."

71
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:46,106
And it started progressing each year.

72
00:04:46,010 --> 00:04:48,107
Those at the top level,

73
00:04:48,508 --> 00:04:52,106
they just do like lots of
calculations in their head.

74
00:04:52,111 --> 00:04:53,936
Something like "A Beautiful Mind"

75
00:04:53,941 --> 00:04:55,556
where you see like all kinds of things.

76
00:04:55,561 --> 00:04:57,970
And using all this information

77
00:04:57,971 --> 00:04:59,014
make your next move.

78
00:04:59,010 --> 00:05:01,018
I see it in a lot of ways
similar to basketball.

79
00:05:02,211 --> 00:05:03,806
Just like a 5 on 5 game

80
00:05:03,811 --> 00:05:05,214
where you kind of have to work together

81
00:05:05,215 --> 00:05:09,146
and utilize each other's strengths and
synergizing everything together.

82
00:05:09,024 --> 00:05:11,063
The teamwork, and the trust,
and the sacrifice

83
00:05:11,028 --> 00:05:14,595
those are all true for every
single team sport.

84
00:05:16,086 --> 00:05:18,777
Dota is a game that unites everybody.

85
00:05:19,007 --> 00:05:21,099
It doesn't matter what country
you're from or race you are.

86
00:05:21,928 --> 00:05:23,679
It's kind of like a bond that is shared

87
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:26,496
and when you're part of this
tight-knit group of people.

88
00:05:26,056 --> 00:05:28,352
It's like having a second family.

89
00:05:29,042 --> 00:05:31,705
That's something you never let go.

90
00:05:31,869 --> 00:05:34,002
Everyone's searching for something.

91
00:05:34,019 --> 00:05:35,063
Fulfillment.

92
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:36,369
Fame.

93
00:05:37,273 --> 00:05:38,779
Satisfaction.

94
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:41,789
It gives you the ability to
become someone else.

95
00:05:42,032 --> 00:05:44,126
A someone who is powerful.

96
00:05:44,352 --> 00:05:46,406
Who can take down 5 opponents.

97
00:05:46,923 --> 00:05:48,927
Express their creativity.

98
00:05:48,928 --> 00:05:52,484
Break the rules without actually
getting arrested.

99
00:05:52,929 --> 00:05:55,818
All of these reasons are
in there somewhere.

100
00:05:55,819 --> 00:05:58,207
The player himself might not even know.

101
00:05:58,264 --> 00:06:00,938
He might not even understand it himself.

102
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,469
But it's there.

103
00:06:08,616 --> 00:06:12,101
Medford, Oregon

104
00:06:14,359 --> 00:06:16,957
Gaming fulfills my competitive need.

105
00:06:16,962 --> 00:06:18,770
I'm a very competitive person.

106
00:06:18,776 --> 00:06:21,367
When it comes to sports,
I consider gaming a sport.

107
00:06:21,372 --> 00:06:23,507
So I use my competitiveness

108
00:06:23,512 --> 00:06:24,807
and I fuel it with Dota.

109
00:06:24,088 --> 00:06:27,107
So it fulfills that side of me completely.

110
00:06:28,201 --> 00:06:31,016
Fear's one of the best
in America, if not the best.

111
00:06:31,022 --> 00:06:32,528
He has a lot of experience.

112
00:06:32,533 --> 00:06:34,197
He's one of the old hogs, basically.

113
00:06:34,202 --> 00:06:36,098
And he's generally just a calm guy.

114
00:06:36,103 --> 00:06:38,208
So, in my opinion, that's his strength.

115
00:06:38,213 --> 00:06:39,512
Really good basketball player.

116
00:06:39,517 --> 00:06:41,603
I remember my coaches watch him playing

117
00:06:41,014 --> 00:06:43,445
and just talk about picking him up
the next year when he came in.

118
00:06:44,044 --> 00:06:45,433
Always had nothing but good things to say,

119
00:06:45,051 --> 00:06:46,145
but he wasn't picked on the team.

120
00:06:47,383 --> 00:06:49,296
The reason was, yeah, he just
wasn't tall enough, I guess.

121
00:06:49,297 --> 00:06:51,008
So, I know that, yeah, he found the game.

122
00:06:51,013 --> 00:06:52,950
He got really devoted in that and stuff

123
00:06:52,955 --> 00:06:54,988
and just found something else that worked.

124
00:06:55,453 --> 00:06:57,474
I was your typical parent.

125
00:06:57,732 --> 00:07:01,571
"Clinton, you're spending too
much time playing computer games."

126
00:07:01,572 --> 00:07:03,025
"You need to go to school."

127
00:07:03,026 --> 00:07:04,573
"You need to go to college."

128
00:07:04,845 --> 00:07:05,758
and he would tell me,

129
00:07:05,763 --> 00:07:08,840
"I want to be able to play
games and get paid for it."

130
00:07:09,061 --> 00:07:11,700
Now he said this at a very young age

131
00:07:12,025 --> 00:07:14,249
before Dota ever came along.

132
00:07:14,012 --> 00:07:16,018
And I thought, well, you know,
he's going to grow out of it.

133
00:07:17,013 --> 00:07:19,908
He's going to get sick and
tired of sitting there

134
00:07:19,913 --> 00:07:21,170
in front of that computer and playing.

135
00:07:21,175 --> 00:07:23,183
Never did. Never did.

136
00:07:27,137 --> 00:07:30,124
Singapore

137
00:07:30,010 --> 00:07:33,224
In Singapore the families actually
put a lot of stress on us

138
00:07:33,423 --> 00:07:35,595
in terms of our education.

139
00:07:35,999 --> 00:07:38,336
I would say it's been tough on me
trying to juggle

140
00:07:38,337 --> 00:07:41,208
both studies and gaming at the same time.

141
00:07:41,054 --> 00:07:43,926
My grades have dropped for
two years already.

142
00:07:44,341 --> 00:07:47,869
And my parents have treated
the gaming as the cause of it.

143
00:07:48,036 --> 00:07:51,054
I mean there was this phrase that
they used. They said,

144
00:07:51,055 --> 00:07:53,582
"Gaming will be the death of you one day."

145
00:07:55,074 --> 00:07:57,833
He's a great player and a great captain.

146
00:07:58,162 --> 00:08:00,873
I would say he's the top player
in Singapore.

147
00:08:01,334 --> 00:08:02,326
Easily.

148
00:08:03,094 --> 00:08:05,351
My parents and my family,

149
00:08:05,356 --> 00:08:07,810
they don't actually speak much
of my gaming career.

150
00:08:07,811 --> 00:08:10,474
They don't tell their friends
and my other relatives

151
00:08:10,475 --> 00:08:12,708
that I'm actually that good at my games.

152
00:08:12,736 --> 00:08:15,736
All along they have only been
bragging about my studies.

153
00:08:15,737 --> 00:08:17,320
Because I used to be an "A" student.

154
00:08:17,321 --> 00:08:19,727
Yeah, they go on and on. And

155
00:08:19,795 --> 00:08:23,839
And it seemed like that was the only thing
they could ever be proud of.

156
00:08:23,997 --> 00:08:26,014
Actually, there has only been one person

157
00:08:26,010 --> 00:08:28,152
that has always been very
supportive of me gaming.

158
00:08:28,166 --> 00:08:31,745
And that was my ex-girlfriend, Huayan.

159
00:08:31,088 --> 00:08:33,091
She's from the female Dota team
in Singapore.

160
00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:35,106
There are a lot of things
that we share in life.

161
00:08:36,074 --> 00:08:37,076
So many things.

162
00:08:37,134 --> 00:08:39,207
In my case, it felt really good,
you know, to have someone

163
00:08:39,095 --> 00:08:41,149
who truly appreciated what you did best.

164
00:08:42,414 --> 00:08:43,749
And loved you for it.

165
00:08:43,755 --> 00:08:47,747
She was aware of what I'm doing
and what I'm passionate about.

166
00:08:48,622 --> 00:08:52,499
The breakup was her decision
and I respected it.

167
00:08:52,504 --> 00:08:54,979
We'd been together for close to three years

168
00:08:54,984 --> 00:08:57,549
and ever since the breakup,
I haven't gotten over it.

169
00:08:57,564 --> 00:08:59,343
I recall the last time she spoke to me

170
00:08:59,344 --> 00:09:01,927
she named me as a bastard so

171
00:09:02,650 --> 00:09:03,604
*Laughter*

172
00:09:04,473 --> 00:09:07,561
We're not in contact anymore,
yeah, but

173
00:09:07,017 --> 00:09:09,172
life goes on.

174
00:09:11,487 --> 00:09:14,706
L'viv, Ukraine

175
00:09:20,015 --> 00:09:21,723
I'm from Ukraine.

176
00:09:22,223 --> 00:09:23,970
My nickname is Dendi.

177
00:09:23,975 --> 00:09:26,280
I finished my university, and

178
00:09:26,285 --> 00:09:29,381
I'm just playing computer games right now.

179
00:09:33,056 --> 00:09:34,290
He was doing music.

180
00:09:34,295 --> 00:09:36,260
He played the piano.

181
00:09:36,265 --> 00:09:38,569
He was doing dancing.

182
00:09:38,608 --> 00:09:43,429
At school, he had musical plays in
which he played the main role.

183
00:09:43,052 --> 00:09:47,374
Audiences were always
impressed by his artistic ability.

184
00:09:48,197 --> 00:09:50,445
When their kids' group was showing,

185
00:09:50,446 --> 00:09:52,430
Danil would always stand out.

186
00:09:54,212 --> 00:09:55,795
When we were growing up

187
00:09:55,796 --> 00:09:58,642
it wasn't a good time financially
for our family.

188
00:09:58,643 --> 00:10:04,435
But my grandma helped us
to get our first computer in 1997.

189
00:10:04,436 --> 00:10:08,022
Early, compared with other kids in Ukraine.

190
00:10:08,157 --> 00:10:10,290
We got visitors every day.

191
00:10:10,658 --> 00:10:13,949
The friends of my older brother
used to come to visit us

192
00:10:13,104 --> 00:10:15,067
and we were playing games.

193
00:10:15,914 --> 00:10:19,803
And Danil, every time looked at what we do.

194
00:10:19,804 --> 00:10:21,829
Every time we would try to push him away

195
00:10:21,092 --> 00:10:23,636
but he would come back and look again.

196
00:10:24,877 --> 00:10:30,752
It was more prominent with him
than with other kids.

197
00:10:31,087 --> 00:10:33,093
During all his conscious life

198
00:10:33,139 --> 00:10:35,623
we were trying to stop him from playing.

199
00:10:35,947 --> 00:10:39,686
We were hiding our computer cord
everywhere in our apartment

200
00:10:39,687 --> 00:10:41,585
but he always found it.

201
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:44,829
I always wanted to understand him better.

202
00:10:44,830 --> 00:10:48,322
Including that hobby, I wanted
to understand him better.

203
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:50,236
There were certain reasons.

204
00:10:50,237 --> 00:10:52,466
I'm not going to mention them now.

205
00:10:52,698 --> 00:10:57,181
I think somewhere deep
inside he's a little bit sad.

206
00:10:57,386 --> 00:11:00,447
She stopped preventing him
from playing Dota.

207
00:11:01,193 --> 00:11:04,506
She gave Dendi the freedom to choose

208
00:11:04,747 --> 00:11:06,805
what is the best for him and his life.

209
00:11:14,588 --> 00:11:17,871
Tournaments back then were
really low prizes.

210
00:11:17,876 --> 00:11:20,689
And a lot of prize money didn't
even get to the players.

211
00:11:20,690 --> 00:11:24,945
There's been a lot of scams with
the managers and stuff like that.

212
00:11:25,246 --> 00:11:29,803
There were, like, some rumors that
it's going to be $50,000 first place,

213
00:11:29,804 --> 00:11:33,573
and everyone was going, like,
"Nah, it's not going to be like that."

214
00:11:33,578 --> 00:11:36,065
August 10, 2011

215
00:11:36,527 --> 00:11:38,528
Watch the forums go nuts, guys.

216
00:11:38,628 --> 00:11:40,526
Watch the forums go nuts.

217
00:11:40,527 --> 00:11:42,233
It is actually confirmed.

218
00:11:42,234 --> 00:11:45,133
It is off the fricking hook.

219
00:11:45,134 --> 00:11:49,105
1.6 million dollar prize pool!

220
00:11:49,106 --> 00:11:50,110
That is for the winner,

221
00:11:50,012 --> 00:11:53,818
1 million dollars for winning Dota!

222
00:11:57,016 --> 00:11:59,612
Dota, the game I've played for 5 years now.

223
00:11:59,617 --> 00:12:01,482
Which I played for fun.

224
00:12:01,487 --> 00:12:03,512
For some food money or whatever, you know.

225
00:12:03,517 --> 00:12:05,102
Ok, it's actually getting big.

226
00:12:05,107 --> 00:12:09,870
It's the largest prize pool of any
gaming competition to date.

227
00:12:09,871 --> 00:12:13,570
It just felt like the start
of something big.

228
00:12:13,571 --> 00:12:14,578
Like a revolution.

229
00:12:15,374 --> 00:12:17,345
You know, we had everything we needed

230
00:12:17,346 --> 00:12:20,658
for the game to become big and
respected as an E Sport.

231
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:22,677
It would kind of like vindicate us.

232
00:12:23,958 --> 00:12:26,975
We're not just playing
because we're addicted.

233
00:12:26,976 --> 00:12:29,453
There's a goal, a motive.

234
00:12:29,836 --> 00:12:33,734
That we can actually reach out and
grab if we are good enough.

235
00:12:41,094 --> 00:12:45,106
Beijing, China

236
00:12:56,073 --> 00:12:59,774
Over in Asia, professional gamers
are treated like rock stars.

237
00:12:59,784 --> 00:13:03,280
It's a viable career opportunity.

238
00:13:03,298 --> 00:13:05,382
They actually live in gamer houses.

239
00:13:05,387 --> 00:13:07,872
So it's set up to be a thing all year long.

240
00:13:07,879 --> 00:13:12,234
I think their approach to practice
is that it's like a day job.

241
00:13:12,248 --> 00:13:14,044
The fan base is immense.

242
00:13:14,049 --> 00:13:18,145
It probably is as big as the
whole western audience together.

243
00:13:18,150 --> 00:13:19,173
Or even more than that.

244
00:13:19,178 --> 00:13:20,885
So now you really have to play good.

245
00:13:20,890 --> 00:13:22,505
You really have to try hard.

246
00:13:22,018 --> 00:13:24,812
It's first place. It's go big or go home.

247
00:13:25,308 --> 00:13:27,214
The big teams get big money.

248
00:13:27,215 --> 00:13:29,973
But the 9th to 16th place earn nothing.

249
00:13:29,978 --> 00:13:31,993
And their salaries are not
worth considering.

250
00:13:32,025 --> 00:13:35,312
While in sports, you have a salary
that you can live on.

251
00:13:35,429 --> 00:13:38,583
With pro gaming, I think that's
one of the toughest parts is

252
00:13:38,588 --> 00:13:39,803
living game to game.

253
00:13:39,808 --> 00:13:41,273
It's like living paycheck to paycheck.

254
00:13:41,278 --> 00:13:43,873
Like, I have to win.
If I don't win, I don't get paid.

255
00:13:43,878 --> 00:13:45,904
That's a tough living for anybody.

256
00:13:46,026 --> 00:13:47,499
It doesn't matter what you're doing.

257
00:13:48,065 --> 00:13:51,274
When your child wants
to be a professional gamer

258
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:53,527
you don't have any history to look back on

259
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:55,248
like other sports.

260
00:13:55,267 --> 00:13:58,471
I don't know anyone who's
made a living at gaming.

261
00:13:58,476 --> 00:14:00,485
So it's kind of a scary thing

262
00:14:00,486 --> 00:14:04,989
when you see your kid putting
their whole life into gaming

263
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:08,053
and not college and
not the traditional things.

264
00:14:08,474 --> 00:14:10,052
What if nothing comes of it?

265
00:14:11,042 --> 00:14:12,158
Regarding the age

266
00:14:12,159 --> 00:14:13,159
I think, yes,

267
00:14:13,654 --> 00:14:18,907
25, 26 years.
It's absolutely maximum for E Sports

268
00:14:18,908 --> 00:14:21,356
because 27, 28, 29, 30

269
00:14:21,357 --> 00:14:23,851
your reaction time is lowering

270
00:14:23,852 --> 00:14:26,749
and you can't click so much, you know,

271
00:14:27,045 --> 00:14:28,050
as the kids do.

272
00:14:28,104 --> 00:14:32,113
A lot of financial responsibilities
are laid upon me right now.

273
00:14:32,933 --> 00:14:37,946
Require me to be successful
in something or have a job.

274
00:14:37,951 --> 00:14:41,348
So it's pretty critical that
I am successful

275
00:14:41,353 --> 00:14:44,882
if I want to continue the gaming career.

276
00:14:46,296 --> 00:14:48,575
He's an "A-Star" student, you know?

277
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:52,168
Because of this gaming,
it pulled him right down.

278
00:14:52,173 --> 00:14:54,614
It's very sad for me.

279
00:14:54,831 --> 00:14:57,884
So here the bad one is Auntie.

280
00:14:57,892 --> 00:14:59,856
Auntie is the one that always
comes here and

281
00:14:59,862 --> 00:15:02,529
nag, nag, nag, nag, nag.

282
00:15:02,697 --> 00:15:05,023
- Am I right?
- It's tough being a gamer.

283
00:15:05,029 --> 00:15:06,243
Sorry?

284
00:15:06,037 --> 00:15:09,046
- Am I right?
- I said, it's tough being a gamer.

285
00:15:09,339 --> 00:15:13,352
Huh, hy? Multi-millionaire.

286
00:15:13,753 --> 00:15:13,756
*Laughter*

287
00:15:14,053 --> 00:15:15,944
For gaming, huh?

288
00:15:17,049 --> 00:15:19,924
Sorry, you are not.

289
00:15:20,069 --> 00:15:23,147
Huh? What is your view?
What is your plan?

290
00:15:24,349 --> 00:15:26,114
That is more important.

291
00:15:26,119 --> 00:15:27,584
I mean, we speak ourselves.

292
00:15:27,589 --> 00:15:30,542
We speak our frank opinion.

293
00:15:30,547 --> 00:15:32,278
This is your choice now.

294
00:15:32,288 --> 00:15:36,003
What do you want in life?
That is more important.

295
00:15:37,037 --> 00:15:39,134
If I'm going to win this tournament

296
00:15:39,135 --> 00:15:40,504
my first thought would be

297
00:15:40,509 --> 00:15:43,854
I will call my ex-girlfriend.

298
00:15:43,859 --> 00:15:45,518
Things got real bad between us and

299
00:15:45,523 --> 00:15:47,844
but right now, for me, if I'm going
to win this tournament,

300
00:15:47,849 --> 00:15:49,844
my first thought would be,
yeah, I would call her.

301
00:15:49,849 --> 00:15:51,316
I would tell her about it and

302
00:15:51,321 --> 00:15:53,486
I would want to share this moment with her

303
00:15:53,491 --> 00:15:54,815
yeah.

304
00:15:59,448 --> 00:16:03,045
This tournament is going to be
a moment in every gamer's life.

305
00:16:03,050 --> 00:16:06,045
Everything that you've been
doing has been building up

306
00:16:06,050 --> 00:16:07,923
and is going to happen over one week.

307
00:16:07,924 --> 00:16:10,018
And then it's not one week anymore.

308
00:16:10,019 --> 00:16:11,115
It's one game.

309
00:16:11,127 --> 00:16:12,515
And then it's not that one game.

310
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:14,092
it's that one moment in the game.

311
00:16:14,097 --> 00:16:17,316
And then that one moment in the
game is where it's going to finish.

312
00:16:17,321 --> 00:16:18,470
And how's it going to finish?

313
00:16:18,061 --> 00:16:20,119
Are you going to be holding up a trophy?

314
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:27,118
Or are you going to be the most
disappointed that you've ever been?

315
00:16:34,879 --> 00:16:37,635
Cologne, Germany

316
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:38,605
It's Tuesday.

317
00:16:38,610 --> 00:16:39,965
So one day before the event.

318
00:16:39,970 --> 00:16:41,595
We already have a lot of setup.

319
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,425
We have a lot of computer setup right here.

320
00:16:43,430 --> 00:16:46,508
The whole booth construction
pretty much finished.

321
00:16:46,531 --> 00:16:48,418
So five players per side.

322
00:16:48,423 --> 00:16:50,018
They can see each other through the glass.

323
00:16:50,023 --> 00:16:51,515
They can't hear each other.

324
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:53,016
This booth is soundproofed up.

325
00:16:53,021 --> 00:16:55,004
Plus, the whole setup here

326
00:16:55,009 --> 00:16:58,515
if you look from above looks
exactly like a Dota map.

327
00:16:58,520 --> 00:16:59,735
And this is the mid.

328
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:01,043
This is where it all happens.

329
00:17:01,112 --> 00:17:02,815
A few teams have already
arrived this morning.

330
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:03,985
We had a lot of teams

331
00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:04,885
from Singapore.

332
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:04,958
We have China.

333
00:17:05,071 --> 00:17:06,253
We had Malaysia coming in

334
00:17:06,762 --> 00:17:07,958
and Russia.

335
00:17:07,963 --> 00:17:11,376
And tomorrow it's finally happening.

336
00:17:18,162 --> 00:17:22,015
We're here live at Gamescom
2011 in beautiful Cologne.

337
00:17:22,016 --> 00:17:24,209
It's the first day of the event.

338
00:17:24,214 --> 00:17:26,642
We've got some of the world's
best teams here in Dota.

339
00:17:26,647 --> 00:17:31,015
And they're handing out a tournament
prize of 1.6 million dollars!

340
00:17:31,016 --> 00:17:33,016
It is massive here.

341
00:17:33,028 --> 00:17:35,016
A tournament of 1.6 million dollars.

342
00:17:35,021 --> 00:17:36,635
That's the future of gaming.

343
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,636
This is awesome!

344
00:17:43,408 --> 00:17:46,161
It's the first time we're
going to see teams

345
00:17:46,174 --> 00:17:48,816
of this caliber assembled
in one location.

346
00:17:48,841 --> 00:17:51,716
These guys are not just nameless faces.

347
00:17:51,723 --> 00:17:53,980
They're the best in the world.

348
00:17:58,524 --> 00:18:00,563
The bunch of teams we have here,

349
00:18:00,564 --> 00:18:04,210
there's a few teams that have individual
skill that's unbelievable.

350
00:18:04,211 --> 00:18:06,494
And then there's a big group of other teams

351
00:18:06,499 --> 00:18:08,426
that have good individual skill,
not top-notch,

352
00:18:08,431 --> 00:18:10,996
but who win through good
strategy and team play.

353
00:18:10,997 --> 00:18:12,065
Fear is a great player, for example,

354
00:18:12,678 --> 00:18:16,162
but he is not comparable
to good players in Asia.

355
00:18:16,163 --> 00:18:18,992
And that's nothing against Fear,
because he's still an excellent player

356
00:18:19,001 --> 00:18:20,790
but he's not them.

357
00:18:37,429 --> 00:18:40,663
Over in Asia, they take gaming
so much more seriously.

358
00:18:40,664 --> 00:18:42,278
Just to give you an example,

359
00:18:42,279 --> 00:18:46,262
the Korean soccer team were
playing in the World Cup.

360
00:18:46,263 --> 00:18:49,852
To motivate the Korean soccer
team to play better,

361
00:18:49,853 --> 00:18:54,799
they brought in Starcraft Brood War
professional gamers

362
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,509
into their locker room before they went out

363
00:18:57,510 --> 00:19:00,497
so that they got to meet
what were their heroes.

364
00:19:00,993 --> 00:19:02,445
Shanghai, China

365
00:19:02,446 --> 00:19:06,453
In China, Dota is to the people
there what Starcraft is to Korea.

366
00:19:06,951 --> 00:19:07,026
It's televised.

367
00:19:08,064 --> 00:19:11,027
The girls like their boyfriends
to be Dota players.

368
00:19:14,868 --> 00:19:17,040
After a game, when they're walking around

369
00:19:17,041 --> 00:19:18,669
you can see fans running up to them

370
00:19:18,670 --> 00:19:20,022
asking them to sign on their shirts.

371
00:19:20,405 --> 00:19:21,405
It's like a real sport.

372
00:19:24,006 --> 00:19:25,457
The third time I was in China,

373
00:19:25,458 --> 00:19:27,466
I was playing with fans for two days.

374
00:19:27,062 --> 00:19:28,249
They made a video of me,

375
00:19:28,655 --> 00:19:29,731
filming me walking in some mountains

376
00:19:30,021 --> 00:19:31,963
and I had to say some sentences and stuff.

377
00:19:34,104 --> 00:19:38,058
And I was like, yeah, "In Dota,
there's always a new mountain to climb."

378
00:19:38,864 --> 00:19:40,317
Stuff like this, you know.

379
00:19:41,592 --> 00:19:43,592
I walked up and down these stairs

380
00:19:43,593 --> 00:19:46,028
and started running and
lifting some weights,

381
00:19:46,029 --> 00:19:49,025
just to compare this with Dota
like some metaphor and stuff.

382
00:19:49,249 --> 00:19:51,254
Fuzhou, I am coming!

383
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:54,055
E Sports in China is already a sport

384
00:19:54,614 --> 00:19:58,581
that is recognized by the
General Administration of Sport.

385
00:19:58,582 --> 00:20:00,594
It is the same as tennis, ping pong, chess.

386
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:03,102
The only thing is that it is
not an Olympic sport.

387
00:20:03,469 --> 00:20:05,054
I will say that China teams are all great.

388
00:20:05,514 --> 00:20:07,519
Every player in the team is strong.

389
00:20:08,031 --> 00:20:10,046
You don't recognize China
players as a player.

390
00:20:10,182 --> 00:20:11,361
You just recognize them as a whole team.

391
00:20:11,362 --> 00:20:12,893
You just fear the whole team.

392
00:20:14,066 --> 00:20:17,087
The Chinese teams that have
come to this competition

393
00:20:17,872 --> 00:20:20,847
are scaring the shit out of everyone else.

394
00:20:24,507 --> 00:20:27,312
We had two of the top
Chinese teams in our group.

395
00:20:27,841 --> 00:20:31,376
Online Kingdom has not been
regarded as one of the favorites to win it.

396
00:20:31,377 --> 00:20:35,799
In fact, they were considered bottom four
or just bottom eight for sure.

397
00:20:36,166 --> 00:20:37,894
This is our first time on LAN together.

398
00:20:37,895 --> 00:20:40,911
The team together has only been
around for around 4-5 months

399
00:20:40,912 --> 00:20:42,530
so it's a relatively new team,

400
00:20:42,531 --> 00:20:45,679
and Pajkatt, our newest addition,
playing Carry for us,

401
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:48,667
he's only been on the team for
three weeks now actually.

402
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:52,067
We were really nervous going
against a Chinese team

403
00:20:52,023 --> 00:20:54,056
especially the top Chinese teams.

404
00:20:54,590 --> 00:20:55,934
There are going to be players that choke

405
00:20:55,935 --> 00:20:59,029
handling this kind of pressure
at such a young age.

406
00:20:59,030 --> 00:21:02,996
1437, this is the first time he's
ever been on LAN.

407
00:21:03,183 --> 00:21:05,435
It's not easy, like, this is a
million dollar tournament.

408
00:21:05,436 --> 00:21:06,055
First time he's been on LAN.

409
00:21:06,055 --> 00:21:08,163
LAN (LOCAL AREA NETWORK) A TOURNAMENT WHERE
ALL THE TEAMS COMPETE IN THE SAME LOCATION

410
00:21:08,164 --> 00:21:10,081
This stage. This prize money.
This prestige.

411
00:21:10,082 --> 00:21:11,051
This is real competition.

412
00:21:11,811 --> 00:21:13,085
We tried to keep our cool together

413
00:21:13,086 --> 00:21:14,640
and we just played our game.

414
00:21:43,165 --> 00:21:44,194
We were super hyped.

415
00:21:44,195 --> 00:21:46,490
Everyone was surprised
we were doing so good.

416
00:21:46,491 --> 00:21:47,812
Even we couldn't believe it.

417
00:21:48,019 --> 00:21:51,151
Online Kingdom dominating right now.

418
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:06,962
After the match against TyLoo,
everyone was very excited, you know.

419
00:22:06,114 --> 00:22:10,235
We just beat one of the teams that was
actually favored to win the competition.

420
00:22:11,091 --> 00:22:12,818
So everyone's spirits were, like,

421
00:22:12,027 --> 00:22:14,644
"Oh, we may be actually
able to do this, you know."

422
00:22:17,577 --> 00:22:18,828
Beating the Chinese teams,

423
00:22:19,241 --> 00:22:21,820
some people just, you know
for fun, they started,

424
00:22:21,821 --> 00:22:24,826
"Ok, hey, it's OK.Nirvana.Int.
They're the China slayers."

425
00:22:30,067 --> 00:22:32,345
A few little bit surprises that
we had yesterday.

426
00:22:32,769 --> 00:22:33,786
Quite a few upsets.

427
00:22:33,787 --> 00:22:37,444
OK.Nirvana.International managing
to beat two Chinese teams in a row,

428
00:22:37,445 --> 00:22:40,398
beating out TyLoo and OK.Nirvana.CN.

429
00:22:40,399 --> 00:22:42,026
They're currently on a roll now.

430
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:44,052
And Chinese teams are not unbeatable.

431
00:22:44,537 --> 00:22:45,865
But on the other hand,

432
00:22:45,866 --> 00:22:49,882
EHOME are just proving that they are
the strongest of the four Chinese teams

433
00:22:49,883 --> 00:22:51,838
having a clean 3-0 record.

434
00:22:51,839 --> 00:22:53,906
They are the favorites to win
the whole tournament.

435
00:22:53,907 --> 00:22:55,891
So they come in with the confidence

436
00:22:55,892 --> 00:22:57,879
that they've won so many
championships already.

437
00:22:57,106 --> 00:22:59,102
It's always a little bit of
national pride at stake.

438
00:22:59,877 --> 00:23:01,481
So, of course, they want
to prove that Chinese

439
00:23:01,494 --> 00:23:02,972
Dota is still a little
bit above the rest.

440
00:23:05,536 --> 00:23:09,490
EHOME is one of the oldest
Chinese Dota organizations.

441
00:23:09,491 --> 00:23:12,145
They've always been at the
top of competitive gaming.

442
00:23:12,146 --> 00:23:15,133
Most memorably at ESWC 2010.

443
00:23:16,144 --> 00:23:18,144
Before ESWC 2010,

444
00:23:18,145 --> 00:23:19,128
I thought, like, yeah ok,

445
00:23:19,129 --> 00:23:21,104
the Chinese, they're probably pretty good,

446
00:23:21,105 --> 00:23:23,046
but like how good can they be?

447
00:23:23,047 --> 00:23:27,005
And then we played EHOME who won that
tournament without losing a single match.

448
00:23:27,006 --> 00:23:28,053
Like, they just crushed every team.

449
00:23:28,898 --> 00:23:32,873
EHOME finished the year as
the best team in the history of Dota.

450
00:23:33,398 --> 00:23:34,406
They were just like on a
totally different level.

451
00:23:35,199 --> 00:23:37,447
Like, they had their manager
sitting behind them.

452
00:23:37,448 --> 00:23:38,444
He was making their calls.

453
00:23:38,445 --> 00:23:40,700
He was running around with this
little black book.

454
00:23:40,701 --> 00:23:43,684
And they were the first team
I heard of who did that.

455
00:23:44,133 --> 00:23:47,387
The EHOME manager copying down
the draft, doing the prep work.

456
00:23:47,388 --> 00:23:48,553
He was their coach.

457
00:23:48,964 --> 00:23:50,956
There was a great interview that was done.

458
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:54,056
And it lined up all the top European
captains who attended

459
00:23:54,228 --> 00:23:56,157
and the topic was EHOME.

460
00:23:56,158 --> 00:23:57,191
If you want to ever play good

461
00:23:57,192 --> 00:23:58,290
you don't need to invite Chinese teams

462
00:23:59,173 --> 00:24:00,189
because they are too strong.

463
00:24:01,143 --> 00:24:02,156
So EHOME won

464
00:24:03,032 --> 00:24:05,057
What do you think of the Chinese guys?

465
00:24:05,058 --> 00:24:08,079
I never felt this outplayed
in my entire life.

466
00:24:08,269 --> 00:24:10,265
It's unbelievable how good they are.

467
00:24:10,266 --> 00:24:11,813
Like, their timing, their discipline

468
00:24:11,814 --> 00:24:13,590
They're really in control
of the game, the whole game,

469
00:24:13,078 --> 00:24:14,479
and they keep this control all the time.

470
00:24:14,993 --> 00:24:16,935
This is really crazy to see, actually.

471
00:24:17,337 --> 00:24:20,262
It's because when we are at
any international tournament,

472
00:24:21,082 --> 00:24:25,045
when all of the foreign team managers
and team members see us,

473
00:24:25,046 --> 00:24:27,104
everyone will all yell out, "EHOME!"

474
00:24:27,105 --> 00:24:30,080
EHOME! EHOME!

475
00:24:30,027 --> 00:24:32,314
Do you know how spectacular that is?

476
00:24:32,369 --> 00:24:34,577
Actually, this is a story. It's a custom.

477
00:24:34,578 --> 00:24:37,322
Which is when everyone sees EHOME,

478
00:24:37,323 --> 00:24:40,799
they naturally think the king is entering.

479
00:24:45,482 --> 00:24:46,958
During this trip to The International,

480
00:24:47,228 --> 00:24:50,294
it's actually the same period
as my exam periods.

481
00:24:50,295 --> 00:24:54,376
So I treated it as a sacrifice
that I've made

482
00:24:54,377 --> 00:24:55,619
for the team and for myself.

483
00:24:56,208 --> 00:24:57,221
And I find that

484
00:24:57,528 --> 00:24:59,411
when it comes to pursuing your passions

485
00:24:59,412 --> 00:25:01,847
it's really up to you to decide
if it's worth the

486
00:25:02,032 --> 00:25:03,057
worth the sacrifice.

487
00:25:10,249 --> 00:25:14,261
When they're having exams,
they don't allow him to leave the school

488
00:25:15,074 --> 00:25:18,062
So I told him really I said,
"Mind yourself."

489
00:25:19,726 --> 00:25:23,023
Setting out on a career in gaming
is risky. It's very risky.

490
00:25:23,659 --> 00:25:25,694
Because the examinations actually
clash with the competition

491
00:25:26,010 --> 00:25:29,412
and missing the exams without
a proper explanation,

492
00:25:29,413 --> 00:25:32,945
the school didn't recognize the Dota
competition as a valid reason.

493
00:25:33,646 --> 00:25:35,209
It's kind of breaking school rules.

494
00:25:36,005 --> 00:25:38,580
The school is very determined
to stop him from pursuing

495
00:25:38,581 --> 00:25:41,577
his chance of going for this contest.

496
00:25:42,390 --> 00:25:47,348
So I think this has created
a big stress for the family.

497
00:25:49,290 --> 00:25:51,315
Gives his mother very headache, you know?

498
00:25:57,056 --> 00:26:00,525
It's quite difficult for us
to pull him out right now, I think.

499
00:26:00,526 --> 00:26:02,502
You know he's so adamant about it.

500
00:26:02,503 --> 00:26:05,260
So that's why when he told me
he's going in August,

501
00:26:05,261 --> 00:26:08,654
I said, "Then how about your school exams?"

502
00:26:08,655 --> 00:26:10,734
"What are you going to do?"

503
00:26:12,050 --> 00:26:14,071
I think my mother,
she was kind of at her limits,

504
00:26:14,557 --> 00:26:17,322
telling me about how much gaming
has been weighing me down.

505
00:26:17,323 --> 00:26:19,659
That was really the talk when I really
opened my heart and I

506
00:26:20,456 --> 00:26:21,829
shared with her my passion for the game

507
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:22,847
and how much I believed that

508
00:26:23,134 --> 00:26:25,696
my team actually has the potential to win,

509
00:26:25,705 --> 00:26:26,697
to be the best in the world.

510
00:26:27,064 --> 00:26:29,162
So we are stopping at nothing
less than first.

511
00:26:30,522 --> 00:26:32,335
This is how I tried to put it
across to my mom.

512
00:26:32,829 --> 00:26:34,173
By giving up so much to come here

513
00:26:34,174 --> 00:26:36,430
I have absolute confidence
in my team that we will win.

514
00:26:37,366 --> 00:26:39,207
Alright the draft is under way.

515
00:26:39,208 --> 00:26:41,216
EHOME, they will select up their heroes.

516
00:26:41,217 --> 00:26:42,781
Scythe will start selecting theirs.

517
00:26:43,062 --> 00:26:44,417
Looking now at both the teams,

518
00:26:44,418 --> 00:26:46,165
it looks like EHOME they're fairly relaxed

519
00:26:46,166 --> 00:26:47,773
while Scythe, you know they're eager.

520
00:26:47,774 --> 00:26:49,841
They're all gathering around hyhy to pick.

521
00:26:50,437 --> 00:26:52,416
If you have a losing draft,
you will lose the game.

522
00:26:52,828 --> 00:26:53,866
This is what I think of Dota.

523
00:26:55,290 --> 00:26:57,323
So it's really a lot on drafting.

524
00:26:57,427 --> 00:27:01,402
Drafting is where two captains will
select what they want to play with.

525
00:27:01,061 --> 00:27:04,040
What heroes are selected
and what heroes are taken out.

526
00:27:04,748 --> 00:27:07,740
You can select five heroes
out of a pool of over a hundred.

527
00:27:07,741 --> 00:27:09,741
And can also remove four of those heroes.

528
00:27:09,852 --> 00:27:12,827
So four heroes you think
your opponent will want to use,

529
00:27:12,828 --> 00:27:13,930
you can remove.

530
00:27:14,355 --> 00:27:16,538
Before any game, any match,

531
00:27:16,539 --> 00:27:18,106
we will decide our bans and picks

532
00:27:18,107 --> 00:27:20,115
according to which team we are fighting.

533
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:23,468
Usually we would come up with
a very impromptu strategy

534
00:27:23,469 --> 00:27:25,082
to try and fight their strat (strategy).

535
00:27:25,029 --> 00:27:27,467
You really have to spend a lot
of time thinking of the draft.

536
00:27:27,522 --> 00:27:30,489
The draft actually decides
a lot of the game itself.

537
00:27:31,805 --> 00:27:33,846
EHOME. They're a team
with so much experience.

538
00:27:34,244 --> 00:27:36,232
They already know the way
they want to roll this one out.

539
00:27:36,044 --> 00:27:37,138
The only thing that's really going to
make it or break it for them

540
00:27:38,174 --> 00:27:40,161
is if they can get their execution right.

541
00:27:41,538 --> 00:27:42,530
In that particular match-up

542
00:27:42,531 --> 00:27:45,626
we felt that we needed something
that could instill the fear in them.

543
00:27:47,113 --> 00:27:49,605
And Tiny looks to be the last pickup
here from Scythe.

544
00:27:49,981 --> 00:27:51,715
A bit of an interesting pickup
there by Scythe.

545
00:27:51,716 --> 00:27:54,435
It's going to start to change around
their lanes completely now.

546
00:27:54,436 --> 00:27:56,531
With Tiny, it is good as
a surprise strategy.

547
00:27:57,387 --> 00:28:00,878
If another team doesn't realize where
he fits into the whole lineup,

548
00:28:00,879 --> 00:28:03,333
then you can really throw
the opposition off balance.

549
00:28:03,033 --> 00:28:04,959
He's moving away, but no, hyhy,

550
00:28:05,876 --> 00:28:07,953
he'll just turn around and
just pops the Lina.

551
00:28:08,103 --> 00:28:09,972
I want to point out right now that EHOME,

552
00:28:10,090 --> 00:28:11,829
they are not noobs (new to the game).

553
00:28:12,028 --> 00:28:15,740
This is just Scythe playing
an amazing game.

554
00:28:16,301 --> 00:28:18,273
When you have such a huge audience and

555
00:28:18,049 --> 00:28:20,078
you know that everyone is at home
watching the game

556
00:28:20,052 --> 00:28:21,098
they have their hopes pinned on you and

557
00:28:22,326 --> 00:28:23,411
I feel that

558
00:28:23,522 --> 00:28:24,773
there's so much at stake.

559
00:28:26,001 --> 00:28:27,878
And they should be able to
clean it up right now.

560
00:28:27,955 --> 00:28:31,250
Tiny, he's gonna toss, he's gonna launch
and he definitely gets the kill.

561
00:28:31,407 --> 00:28:34,664
We got 357 getting nailed out there.

562
00:28:34,829 --> 00:28:37,290
Nature's Prophet going to get
the last hit in as well.

563
00:28:37,291 --> 00:28:39,585
It's the entire team down for EHOME.

564
00:28:39,829 --> 00:28:40,996
This is GG.

565
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:43,672
This is now a double-rax, at least.

566
00:28:43,673 --> 00:28:45,717
And EHOME, they're going to disconnect.

567
00:28:45,718 --> 00:28:48,515
We have our first
Winner's Bracket Finalist.

568
00:28:48,517 --> 00:28:49,538
Scythe will advance.

569
00:28:49,728 --> 00:28:53,055
EHOME will drop down into
the Loser's Bracket,

570
00:28:53,205 --> 00:28:55,320
and Scythe will now finish up this game.

571
00:29:00,582 --> 00:29:02,251
Yeah, the one million is

572
00:29:02,907 --> 00:29:04,409
yeah, one million.

573
00:29:05,491 --> 00:29:06,659
That's a lot.

574
00:29:08,038 --> 00:29:10,624
It's going to make my time
playing this game all worth it.

575
00:29:14,527 --> 00:29:17,614
Didn't think smoking would do me any good.

576
00:29:19,437 --> 00:29:20,396
When did you start smoking?

577
00:29:24,947 --> 00:29:26,448
Two years back.

578
00:29:26,449 --> 00:29:27,283
Two years back.

579
00:29:28,441 --> 00:29:29,400
Bad move.

580
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:34,914
That seems to coincide with when you
and your ex-girlfriend broke up.

581
00:29:43,908 --> 00:29:45,534
On bad terms

582
00:29:46,210 --> 00:29:47,795
Seems like she's moved on already.

583
00:29:48,636 --> 00:29:49,929
Back then when she was playing the game

584
00:29:49,930 --> 00:29:52,766
it felt like we had something we shared.

585
00:29:53,373 --> 00:29:54,499
Yeah, but right now, it's like

586
00:29:58,344 --> 00:30:01,806
I think she's following this event, but

587
00:30:02,894 --> 00:30:03,561
probably

588
00:30:03,562 --> 00:30:04,563
This event's big.

589
00:30:12,478 --> 00:30:15,147
I hope I will get to make that phone call.

590
00:30:17,230 --> 00:30:19,941
Finally I'll have something I'm proud of
to tell her about.

591
00:30:20,217 --> 00:30:21,093
Finally.

592
00:30:37,035 --> 00:30:39,163
When you played the Russians
and the Ukrainians,

593
00:30:39,311 --> 00:30:40,937
they were just the unpredictable teams.

594
00:30:41,385 --> 00:30:43,513
I had no idea what the Russians
were thinking.

595
00:30:43,831 --> 00:30:45,166
That was their best weapon.

596
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:47,161
Well, we're having fun.

597
00:30:47,085 --> 00:30:49,420
We're trying to relax.

598
00:30:50,225 --> 00:30:52,394
We're trying to scare our opponents.

599
00:30:52,735 --> 00:30:54,154
Mind games. Mind games.

600
00:30:55,689 --> 00:31:00,026
I turn off my brain in the way
of being scared of someone.

601
00:31:00,941 --> 00:31:03,736
One of the things I really
admire about him is how

602
00:31:04,337 --> 00:31:05,408
he hasn't really had an easy life

603
00:31:06,588 --> 00:31:09,216
but he's always so upbeat.

604
00:31:09,575 --> 00:31:10,868
He's always so cheerful.

605
00:31:11,305 --> 00:31:12,557
When he first came on the Dota scene,

606
00:31:12,558 --> 00:31:14,539
he looked like a 12-year-old boy.

607
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:17,251
Everyone was just, like, "Who is this kid?"

608
00:31:17,252 --> 00:31:18,323
There's no way you can
take this guy seriously.

609
00:31:19,173 --> 00:31:21,300
And then he would destroy you in games!

610
00:31:22,072 --> 00:31:24,164
I saw somewhere on the internet

611
00:31:25,603 --> 00:31:28,981
how he works with the keyboard.

612
00:31:28,982 --> 00:31:32,505
It really is mesmerizing.

613
00:31:44,637 --> 00:31:49,643
I think Danil benefited
from his piano playing

614
00:31:49,644 --> 00:31:52,647
because his hands are absolutely amazing.

615
00:31:54,443 --> 00:31:55,736
He can make really good moves.

616
00:31:55,888 --> 00:31:58,057
His moves, I think are unique,

617
00:31:58,041 --> 00:32:00,418
and they might win you the game.

618
00:32:01,030 --> 00:32:03,074
But he wants to rely completely on skill.

619
00:32:03,075 --> 00:32:04,994
He wants, like, an enemy against him

620
00:32:04,995 --> 00:32:07,789
and he wants to kill him through skill,
nothing more.

621
00:32:07,790 --> 00:32:09,221
He wants to win the game.

622
00:32:09,222 --> 00:32:11,840
His disadvantage is that
he doesn't have patience.

623
00:32:11,841 --> 00:32:12,912
He wants to make those moves.

624
00:32:13,749 --> 00:32:15,793
He can get a little bit too silly in games.

625
00:32:15,973 --> 00:32:18,267
He will try new and different things.

626
00:32:18,268 --> 00:32:20,437
He will overextend in team fights

627
00:32:20,438 --> 00:32:22,023
because he believes he can get the kill.

628
00:32:22,024 --> 00:32:23,948
And his impatience can go too far

629
00:32:23,949 --> 00:32:25,534
and he might lose the game for us.

630
00:32:33,056 --> 00:32:34,433
Oh, Nature's Prophet, he's going to go in.

631
00:32:34,695 --> 00:32:35,821
This should be the First Blood.

632
00:32:35,822 --> 00:32:37,615
They got the Sprout on Sansheng as well.

633
00:32:37,616 --> 00:32:38,867
There's probably going to be a double.

634
00:32:38,868 --> 00:32:40,912
Dendi's ulti, it hits!

635
00:32:41,913 --> 00:32:43,039
Dendi, Dendi, no, no.

636
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:44,751
He's not he cannot be.

637
00:32:44,752 --> 00:32:45,826
This is Dendi through and through.

638
00:32:46,493 --> 00:32:49,622
Starts with the Hex, goes to Cold
Snap, he locks him in place!

639
00:32:49,764 --> 00:32:51,682
Weaver really close to death!

640
00:32:51,683 --> 00:32:53,435
Manages to Timelapse back out again.

641
00:32:53,865 --> 00:32:56,326
Dendi will TP (teleport) back to safety.

642
00:32:56,999 --> 00:32:59,351
So GG being called by iG.

643
00:32:59,352 --> 00:33:01,380
Na'Vi, they will take the game.

644
00:33:01,612 --> 00:33:06,549
Our Winners Bracket Finalists are
going to be Na'Vi versus Scythe.

645
00:33:11,699 --> 00:33:16,383
Most teams that you see that have
the most fan bases are full nationality.

646
00:33:16,384 --> 00:33:18,930
Our team is all spread out
across the world.

647
00:33:20,035 --> 00:33:22,496
He does have it a little harder than us

648
00:33:23,847 --> 00:33:27,308
because he doesn't really have
this human support

649
00:33:27,929 --> 00:33:29,138
that we do.

650
00:33:34,610 --> 00:33:38,322
Medford, Oregon

651
00:33:43,176 --> 00:33:45,428
The hardest thing that I've had
to really deal with in my life

652
00:33:45,429 --> 00:33:49,267
is just trying to convince my family
about my gaming career.

653
00:33:49,683 --> 00:33:52,352
It's really, really difficult especially
when you start out slow

654
00:33:52,353 --> 00:33:54,814
but you know there's a future for something

655
00:33:54,815 --> 00:33:55,908
and you put a lot of time into it,

656
00:33:55,910 --> 00:33:58,003
and they keep telling you,
"You should probably get a real job."

657
00:34:05,746 --> 00:34:10,167
I was born in the Los Angeles district
in Lancaster, California.

658
00:34:10,042 --> 00:34:12,044
I lived there with my dad and my mom.

659
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:15,578
Around 2 years old, my dad left my mom.

660
00:34:16,711 --> 00:34:18,839
He didn't really say anything.
He just kind of

661
00:34:19,097 --> 00:34:20,168
He just packed up and left.

662
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:26,752
She's had to raise us both while
going to law school at the same time.

663
00:34:28,205 --> 00:34:31,247
It wasn't real easy as far as
just got out of law school,

664
00:34:31,626 --> 00:34:35,474
didn't have a job, had huge
student loans to pay back.

665
00:34:36,658 --> 00:34:39,725
This job came up and so
we moved here on our own.

666
00:34:40,032 --> 00:34:42,576
So I've been raising them by myself
ever since.

667
00:34:44,647 --> 00:34:50,195
So this is a photo album
that I made for Clinton.

668
00:34:50,196 --> 00:34:54,153
As he was growing up, I put pictures
in it as we went along.

669
00:34:54,154 --> 00:34:56,573
My sons were both really active into sports

670
00:34:56,574 --> 00:34:58,159
and they wanted to do a lot

671
00:34:58,160 --> 00:34:59,662
so I had to limit them.

672
00:34:59,663 --> 00:35:00,759
They could choose two per season.

673
00:35:01,998 --> 00:35:05,377
That was maximum for me being
able to get them to practice

674
00:35:05,627 --> 00:35:07,086
and go watch their games.

675
00:35:07,251 --> 00:35:08,544
That was tough.

676
00:35:09,263 --> 00:35:13,267
And Clinton sitting on Santa's lap
- his brother Santa.

677
00:35:15,512 --> 00:35:18,426
My brother's more angry at my father
for leaving than I am.

678
00:35:18,848 --> 00:35:19,849
He thinks about him.

679
00:35:20,292 --> 00:35:21,251
He gets upset.

680
00:35:21,707 --> 00:35:25,795
Compared to me, I just block him out
and pretend he doesn't exist.

681
00:35:27,274 --> 00:35:30,528
Clinton already starting video games here.

682
00:35:32,907 --> 00:35:34,742
He was sitting at his house,
you know, playing Dota.

683
00:35:34,743 --> 00:35:37,788
Doing it competitively, had a sponsored
team and everything like that.

684
00:35:38,365 --> 00:35:42,068
But I think that's when it started
getting on his mom's nerves.

685
00:35:43,258 --> 00:35:45,136
I have a crazy sleeping schedule.

686
00:35:45,756 --> 00:35:49,677
I'm on a European team so sometimes I
have to stay up pretty ridiculous hours

687
00:35:49,678 --> 00:35:51,513
or wake up at ridiculous hours.

688
00:35:51,686 --> 00:35:55,064
So the standard day for me is
not so standard.

689
00:35:55,754 --> 00:35:58,590
All the nights he'd be up and stuff,
the dog would be up too with him

690
00:35:58,591 --> 00:36:01,260
and that would keep her awake
most of the nights

691
00:36:01,261 --> 00:36:04,765
and this is kind of where
the tension got pretty high.

692
00:36:05,225 --> 00:36:06,944
You know, this went on for years

693
00:36:06,945 --> 00:36:09,531
and it came to the point
where I just told him

694
00:36:09,532 --> 00:36:12,910
I said, "You know what, you just
need to go somewhere else."

695
00:36:14,483 --> 00:36:19,029
So I got kicked out of my house because
of my gaming career, basically.

696
00:36:23,044 --> 00:36:25,421
When Clinton first moved in here,

697
00:36:25,422 --> 00:36:29,510
he was looking for a desk and
there wasn't anything in the room.

698
00:36:29,511 --> 00:36:33,598
And I had a lot of stuff we were
getting ready to take to the dump.

699
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:37,637
And Clinton went out there and he
came back in with this green desk.

700
00:36:37,125 --> 00:36:38,584
And he goes, "This is perfect!"

701
00:36:39,782 --> 00:36:41,868
So I didn't have a monitor,
so I went to my friend

702
00:36:41,869 --> 00:36:43,704
and he had a spare CRT monitor.

703
00:36:43,705 --> 00:36:48,043
So I got that, and then, obviously,
I have two books here to hunch that up

704
00:36:48,044 --> 00:36:49,545
so I can actually see the monitor.

705
00:36:49,546 --> 00:36:50,592
So it's kind of a ghetto setup.

706
00:36:51,239 --> 00:36:53,734
Even when I go to
competitions, I don't think

707
00:36:53,747 --> 00:36:56,035
I play any differently
on the nice setups

708
00:36:56,036 --> 00:36:57,705
compared to this one.

709
00:36:57,802 --> 00:37:00,805
Clinton's like the Rocky Balboa of Dota.

710
00:37:01,209 --> 00:37:04,004
He's definitely one of
the first big US players

711
00:37:04,005 --> 00:37:06,883
and honestly, I didn't even know
he was that big.

712
00:37:07,485 --> 00:37:11,947
In the North American scene, there weren't
many good American players known back then.

713
00:37:12,492 --> 00:37:14,119
Everybody respected Fear.

714
00:37:16,585 --> 00:37:19,421
A lot of the people I knew,
they quit the game.

715
00:37:19,422 --> 00:37:20,923
They moved on, stuff like that.

716
00:37:20,924 --> 00:37:24,386
But I stuck with it so I ended up
being like one of the oldest players.

717
00:37:24,677 --> 00:37:26,304
With all his years of experience,

718
00:37:26,305 --> 00:37:29,182
and all his constant commitment
to the game,

719
00:37:29,183 --> 00:37:31,311
he's really shown that he doesn't give up.

720
00:37:31,110 --> 00:37:32,361
Growing up without my father,

721
00:37:33,073 --> 00:37:38,594
I think in the end, not having someone
there and teach me the guy side

722
00:37:38,595 --> 00:37:40,430
and having a father to help you up,

723
00:37:40,035 --> 00:37:43,372
I think that it's actually probably made me
the person I am today.

724
00:37:44,234 --> 00:37:46,528
You know, I just make sure everything's
running smoothly on the team.

725
00:37:46,529 --> 00:37:48,990
I kind of play, like,
the father figure, I guess.

726
00:37:49,260 --> 00:37:52,799
As a captain, I guess he felt
he had that responsibility as well.

727
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:55,122
He was like pretty much my mentor.

728
00:37:55,123 --> 00:37:56,359
He did tell me one time,

729
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:58,779
"Hey if you need someone to talk to,"
he would be here.

730
00:37:58,780 --> 00:38:02,325
So I kind of see him as a Dota brother.

731
00:38:02,326 --> 00:38:05,167
I've never had an ego thinking that
I'm better than anyone else.

732
00:38:05,168 --> 00:38:08,505
I'm always there willing to help people
who are new to the scene.

733
00:38:08,772 --> 00:38:10,774
And that's always been kind of
my role in the game

734
00:38:10,775 --> 00:38:13,861
by just helping players get up
for the most part.

735
00:38:15,198 --> 00:38:18,410
Fear actually broke me
into the scene, you know.

736
00:38:18,069 --> 00:38:20,655
It's very hard to get yourself out there.

737
00:38:20,998 --> 00:38:24,066
I mean, back then, I was kind of
like a fan boy of him.

738
00:38:24,670 --> 00:38:26,505
You know, watching his games and what-not.

739
00:38:26,645 --> 00:38:30,441
And he gave me a shot to play
at a high level.

740
00:38:31,863 --> 00:38:34,282
I wouldn't be here today
if it wasn't for Fear.

741
00:38:34,283 --> 00:38:36,118
I can guarantee you that.

742
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:44,676
Going into the match, we were all thinking,

743
00:38:44,677 --> 00:38:46,744
MUFC didn't do so well earlier, but

744
00:38:47,411 --> 00:38:50,486
If we lost that game,
we wouldn't win anything so

745
00:38:50,487 --> 00:38:52,416
it was a high risk game.

746
00:38:52,417 --> 00:38:58,215
36 minutes in, almost a 7,000 gold
advantage in favor of MUFC

747
00:38:59,021 --> 00:39:00,689
Toward the end of the game,
we made a couple of mistakes

748
00:39:00,690 --> 00:39:02,905
that put two heroes on the sideline for us.

749
00:39:02,906 --> 00:39:04,922
And they had all five
still up and decided that

750
00:39:04,935 --> 00:39:06,961
they were going to go for
our Throne (Ancient).

751
00:39:06,125 --> 00:39:07,196
They're probably just going
to push for the base.

752
00:39:08,673 --> 00:39:10,216
They're going GG!

753
00:39:10,217 --> 00:39:11,586
They want to go for the GG!

754
00:39:11,587 --> 00:39:12,596
No Fortification anymore!

755
00:39:12,678 --> 00:39:14,979
We were really close to losing our Throne.

756
00:39:14,980 --> 00:39:17,006
It's below 20 percent HP

757
00:39:17,007 --> 00:39:21,999
And Online Kingdom, they are so close to
getting eliminated from this tournament!

758
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,585
We just needed to do something.

759
00:39:23,926 --> 00:39:25,899
Alright, I'm going to go on them!
I'm going to initiate on them!

760
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:28,038
So I ran in first and then
they all went on me

761
00:39:28,039 --> 00:39:30,405
instead of focusing on the Throne,
which is good.

762
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:32,304
Again by Silvercross.

763
00:39:32,423 --> 00:39:34,466
Fear, he's trying to retreat.

764
00:39:34,467 --> 00:39:36,344
He turns into a pig.

765
00:39:36,470 --> 00:39:38,889
How the hell is he still alive?!!

766
00:39:39,597 --> 00:39:41,816
Go, go, go! Go, go!

767
00:39:42,028 --> 00:39:44,824
They push MUFC back!

768
00:39:45,049 --> 00:39:49,053
We made this huge comeback where
we killed all of their heroes.

769
00:39:49,198 --> 00:39:50,366
You know, started pushing.

770
00:39:50,367 --> 00:39:52,202
Silvercross is down!

771
00:39:52,050 --> 00:39:53,802
Morphling! He's out of this!

772
00:39:54,129 --> 00:39:55,630
The Top Rax (barracks) will go!

773
00:39:55,806 --> 00:39:58,767
There is no way now that
MUFC can come back!

774
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:03,604
But it will be Online Kingdom
eliminating MUFC!

775
00:40:04,324 --> 00:40:06,910
Our whole team just went crazy.

776
00:40:06,911 --> 00:40:10,998
Fear leading Online Kingdom
to do the impossible.

777
00:40:11,468 --> 00:40:13,845
I've never seen anything like that.

778
00:40:13,846 --> 00:40:14,789
And stay tuned.

779
00:40:14,790 --> 00:40:18,266
We'll be back here with more
exciting gameplay coming up.

780
00:40:32,694 --> 00:40:33,612
Scythe.

781
00:40:33,807 --> 00:40:37,269
They are the 2008 ESWC winners.

782
00:40:37,379 --> 00:40:39,402
One of the best Asian teams

783
00:40:39,070 --> 00:40:40,999
but we aren't afraid of them.

784
00:40:41,036 --> 00:40:42,057
We're gonna fight them.

785
00:40:43,034 --> 00:40:44,411
I don't know about my teammates,

786
00:40:44,511 --> 00:40:47,347
but I don't feel scared at all.

787
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:51,346
I feel like I want to crush my enemy.

788
00:40:51,749 --> 00:40:53,042
That's how I feel.

789
00:40:53,527 --> 00:40:54,445
That's it.

790
00:40:56,095 --> 00:40:58,138
Welcome to the Winners Bracket Final

791
00:40:58,697 --> 00:41:00,790
where Scythe goes up against Na'Vi.

792
00:41:01,058 --> 00:41:04,336
The winner gets a slot in the Grand Final.

793
00:41:05,932 --> 00:41:07,767
The crowds were all cheering for them.

794
00:41:07,768 --> 00:41:09,187
And their draft was very scary.

795
00:41:09,188 --> 00:41:11,231
We were, like, caught off by surprise.

796
00:41:11,662 --> 00:41:13,414
But, we were like,
we've gotta win this, man.

797
00:41:13,415 --> 00:41:14,958
We've gotta win this and
show them who's boss.

798
00:41:16,943 --> 00:41:19,946
Scythe has managed to take all
the best players from Singapore

799
00:41:19,947 --> 00:41:21,240
and put them in their lineup.

800
00:41:21,576 --> 00:41:22,869
One million!

801
00:41:22,881 --> 00:41:24,902
Na'Vi, they look cool calm and collected.

802
00:41:25,092 --> 00:41:26,719
They know exactly what they gotta do.

803
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:28,722
It all comes down to gameplay right now

804
00:41:28,723 --> 00:41:31,536
and I gotta say like, Na'Vi's lineup,
it is not unbeatable.

805
00:41:33,373 --> 00:41:35,664
Now they're gonna look for the initiation
and possible kill.

806
00:41:35,665 --> 00:41:37,792
hy is gonna get caught.

807
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:40,035
Now bottom lane. Held in place.

808
00:41:40,036 --> 00:41:42,490
Sven stunned. Sven will go down.

809
00:41:42,491 --> 00:41:45,558
LighTofHeaveN, he helped out but
Ancient Apparition gets the last hit.

810
00:41:46,952 --> 00:41:49,330
Na'Vi are dominating this final.

811
00:41:50,230 --> 00:41:52,483
Now Na'Vi, they're gonna
take the chance here.

812
00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:53,622
They're gonna go in for the GG.

813
00:41:54,028 --> 00:41:57,281
And GG is the call from hy first.

814
00:41:57,282 --> 00:41:59,534
Na'Vi are already off their computers.

815
00:41:59,535 --> 00:42:00,581
They're not even sticking around.

816
00:42:00,996 --> 00:42:02,664
They've got the GG.

817
00:42:02,665 --> 00:42:07,451
Na'Vi are into the Grand Finals and
will play for the one million dollars.

818
00:42:07,486 --> 00:42:11,450
Scythe will go down. They will face
the winner of the Loser's Bracket.

819
00:42:12,712 --> 00:42:15,173
We had just lost our confidence match
against Na'Vi.

820
00:42:16,225 --> 00:42:17,476
It was actually quite a blow to us.

821
00:42:19,241 --> 00:42:21,035
The game was really
the turning point for me

822
00:42:21,861 --> 00:42:25,824
because I actually learned that in life
you can only trust in yourself, actually

823
00:42:25,114 --> 00:42:27,167
not in the sense that
you can't trust people

824
00:42:27,879 --> 00:42:30,921
but, yeah, like I said, the one who will
never let you down is yourself.

825
00:42:37,341 --> 00:42:39,509
Medford, Oregon

826
00:42:41,916 --> 00:42:42,959
Within the gaming world

827
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:46,002
You know, it's like I'm following behind
my mother's footsteps basically.

828
00:42:46,381 --> 00:42:48,633
She worked really hard to get where she is,

829
00:42:48,634 --> 00:42:49,927
and I kind of want to be the same way.

830
00:42:49,928 --> 00:42:51,805
I want to work hard for whatever I do.

831
00:42:53,337 --> 00:42:56,132
For me, I mean I've never really had a dad.

832
00:42:56,133 --> 00:42:59,011
So if I had any questions about anything

833
00:42:59,012 --> 00:43:01,514
the person I was most comfortable
talking to was my mom.

834
00:43:02,301 --> 00:43:04,679
She definitely had
the most influence on my life.

835
00:43:07,417 --> 00:43:08,960
When she comes home from work

836
00:43:08,961 --> 00:43:13,578
she's always anxious to bring up
the subject how she won a big case.

837
00:43:13,579 --> 00:43:15,600
And I'm always proud of her
when she wins these big cases

838
00:43:15,790 --> 00:43:17,417
because I know it means a lot to her.

839
00:43:19,153 --> 00:43:21,614
I mean, in the back of my head,
I'm always, like,

840
00:43:21,093 --> 00:43:23,137
If I do well and if I win this tournament,

841
00:43:24,011 --> 00:43:28,432
I'll finally be able to prove that
I'm getting something out of this.

842
00:43:32,247 --> 00:43:35,525
And whoever wins this match will be
facing up against EHOME,

843
00:43:35,526 --> 00:43:38,867
but whoever will lose it, is going
to be eliminated already.

844
00:43:38,868 --> 00:43:40,787
Like, EHOME, they're looking
really strong right now.

845
00:43:40,788 --> 00:43:43,491
We had the stronger late-game heroes,
the better team fight.

846
00:43:43,752 --> 00:43:46,780
Just all we had to do was just
control the pushes.

847
00:43:46,781 --> 00:43:48,324
Now, Online Kingdom, they're split!

848
00:43:48,325 --> 00:43:50,369
The stun on Santa! The splash as well.

849
00:43:50,370 --> 00:43:51,412
They're gonna claim a Windrunner.

850
00:43:51,413 --> 00:43:52,831
Will they? Yes they do!

851
00:43:52,832 --> 00:43:54,960
It's 2-0 for Online Kingdom.

852
00:43:54,961 --> 00:43:58,130
Moscow 5, not the start they wanted.

853
00:43:58,131 --> 00:44:00,092
But Online Kingdom having an amazing start

854
00:44:00,093 --> 00:44:05,106
We were so close to winning until some few
mistakes that occurred in the late game.

855
00:44:05,224 --> 00:44:06,433
They might go right now.

856
00:44:06,434 --> 00:44:08,770
There's four heroes standing
right next to each other.

857
00:44:08,771 --> 00:44:10,147
The timing is wrong!

858
00:44:10,672 --> 00:44:13,424
There's communication problems
because we're an international team.

859
00:44:13,425 --> 00:44:17,429
So I think full-nationality teams have
an advantage over most teams.

860
00:44:17,430 --> 00:44:19,599
Almost there! Big try!

861
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:20,878
Fear's in trouble though.

862
00:44:20,879 --> 00:44:22,714
He's shackled and Lacoste is in.

863
00:44:22,715 --> 00:44:24,510
He casts his ulti as well.

864
00:44:24,843 --> 00:44:26,678
And it just fell apart from there.

865
00:44:26,977 --> 00:44:28,603
They just slowly beat us down.

866
00:44:28,604 --> 00:44:30,512
Eventually they just
broke our base and took

867
00:44:30,525 --> 00:44:32,316
every single one of
our raxes (barracks).

868
00:44:32,950 --> 00:44:35,411
This is really hurting Online Kingdom.

869
00:44:35,412 --> 00:44:36,579
They've lost three.

870
00:44:36,580 --> 00:44:37,832
Enigma pops.

871
00:44:37,833 --> 00:44:40,627
The team is wiped for Online Kingdom.

872
00:44:40,628 --> 00:44:43,737
The base will be taken
and Moscow 5 will now

873
00:44:43,750 --> 00:44:46,662
play EHOME and advance
in the tournament.

874
00:44:46,969 --> 00:44:51,332
Now, Online Kingdom, they are out.
So much promise

875
00:44:51,333 --> 00:44:54,898
It didn't happen in the end for Fear
and the rest of Online Kingdom,

876
00:44:55,057 --> 00:44:58,351
and it will be Moscow 5 that will advance.

877
00:45:01,128 --> 00:45:04,756
I think everybody on the team
was very emotional.

878
00:45:07,186 --> 00:45:09,855
I could only imagine how he was feeling.

879
00:45:11,839 --> 00:45:15,718
Some people take it more personally
and they give everything to win.

880
00:45:16,631 --> 00:45:20,427
It was very satisfying knowing
that we reached that Top 8,

881
00:45:20,428 --> 00:45:23,664
but he had better expectations
for our team,

882
00:45:23,665 --> 00:45:25,757
and we'd come a long way
and it's all thanks to Fear.

883
00:45:27,130 --> 00:45:31,677
If you don't go as far as you
thought you were going to be,

884
00:45:33,265 --> 00:45:35,851
I guess you end up in tears or something.

885
00:45:42,288 --> 00:45:44,334
All of us are really disappointed, but

886
00:45:44,749 --> 00:45:46,418
I guess that's just how it goes.

887
00:45:48,790 --> 00:45:52,294
When I get back home, I need to
make a big decision in my life.

888
00:45:52,295 --> 00:45:54,631
Like, just the benefits of
playing Dota professionally,

889
00:45:54,632 --> 00:45:55,799
how much I can make from it,

890
00:45:56,620 --> 00:46:00,416
and how much time I really need to put
into it to be one hundred percent, so

891
00:46:00,075 --> 00:46:03,787
The only way I would ever do that is if
I move in with my teammates

892
00:46:04,130 --> 00:46:05,632
and have like a training house with them

893
00:46:05,852 --> 00:46:07,979
so I know for sure that
we're all dedicated.

894
00:46:09,320 --> 00:46:11,572
I think things happen for a reason,

895
00:46:11,573 --> 00:46:13,950
and when things happen,
you just do your best,

896
00:46:13,951 --> 00:46:15,912
and continue going forward with it.

897
00:46:16,639 --> 00:46:19,189
I mean, deep down inside,
I know this career

898
00:46:19,202 --> 00:46:21,478
is going to work out
for me in the end.

899
00:46:25,502 --> 00:46:27,403
As for the Chinese teams I
hope and know that they're

900
00:46:27,416 --> 00:46:29,010
capable of coming out
of the Losers Bracket.

901
00:46:29,011 --> 00:46:35,226
The top three teams are likely to be
Na'Vi, Scythe, and a Chinese team

902
00:46:35,227 --> 00:46:38,105
which I personally hope will be EHOME.

903
00:46:38,661 --> 00:46:44,875
Emotionally, I would hope
that EHOME would win.

904
00:46:44,876 --> 00:46:45,877
Turning him into a pig!

905
00:46:45,122 --> 00:46:46,456
They need to get this kill.

906
00:46:47,213 --> 00:46:50,341
The stun! The Weaver Wave!
It's a little piglet!

907
00:46:50,342 --> 00:46:52,261
And it's dead! Slardar!

908
00:46:52,262 --> 00:46:54,389
820, he's almost dead!

909
00:46:54,390 --> 00:46:57,018
Burrow Strike! Epicenter!

910
00:46:57,019 --> 00:47:01,023
357! It's a double-kill by the Weaver!

911
00:47:01,024 --> 00:47:04,152
EHOME, they'll lose FCB as well.

912
00:47:04,153 --> 00:47:07,170
Moscow 5, casualties of war.

913
00:47:07,497 --> 00:47:10,083
Holy Hell.

914
00:47:10,279 --> 00:47:13,263
In China, this game is
a professional career.

915
00:47:13,594 --> 00:47:15,221
We are stressed because we have to win.

916
00:47:15,222 --> 00:47:19,726
If we don't win or we lose
to foreign teams,

917
00:47:19,727 --> 00:47:22,395
Chinese fans will have doubt in us.

918
00:47:23,090 --> 00:47:25,134
Now Lion though is going to find him.
Hexes him up.

919
00:47:25,135 --> 00:47:26,636
Finger's already started. There's the stun.

920
00:47:26,637 --> 00:47:27,658
Maelk in a lot of trouble.

921
00:47:27,119 --> 00:47:27,911
Really caught out of position.

922
00:47:28,641 --> 00:47:30,435
AA ulti will fly in but hits on nothing.

923
00:47:30,436 --> 00:47:32,062
Mania with the SK ultimate

924
00:47:32,063 --> 00:47:33,815
The situation is China against the world.

925
00:47:36,232 --> 00:47:38,651
If we win the championship,
it is what we are supposed to do.

926
00:47:38,652 --> 00:47:42,272
I tell them, if you are coming here,
you are here for the first place.

927
00:47:42,273 --> 00:47:46,986
I will tell them every day, we must
accomplish this. We must achieve this.

928
00:47:48,543 --> 00:47:49,717
Our tradition is

929
00:47:49,718 --> 00:47:51,720
anything other than the champion trophy
we will not bring home.

930
00:47:51,721 --> 00:47:54,339
They will go ahead
and trash it at the airport.

931
00:47:54,558 --> 00:47:57,311
Now PLT. Support Teleporting in.
FCB gets the first stun.

932
00:47:57,547 --> 00:47:59,548
Misery over-commits on the top lane.

933
00:48:08,644 --> 00:48:10,437
GG!

934
00:48:11,395 --> 00:48:16,734
I can feel they really want to beat us,
the foreign teams.

935
00:48:17,384 --> 00:48:18,301
PLT, he's had enough of this.

936
00:48:18,532 --> 00:48:21,619
FCB! What a time for a Frog!

937
00:48:21,676 --> 00:48:23,135
Misery will pop!

938
00:48:25,310 --> 00:48:28,897
But when they watch us play, they feel

939
00:48:30,258 --> 00:48:31,304
that there is no way to beat us.

940
00:48:41,565 --> 00:48:44,526
Singapore

941
00:48:44,858 --> 00:48:46,401
This is where my dad works.

942
00:48:46,785 --> 00:48:47,786
For as long as I remember,

943
00:48:48,656 --> 00:48:51,201
he's doing the logistics
for the company here.

944
00:48:51,586 --> 00:48:56,591
So it involves the shipping of the
containers from one place to another.

945
00:48:58,572 --> 00:49:02,327
When I was younger, he used to work, like,
15 to 16 hours a day.

946
00:49:03,517 --> 00:49:06,145
He's pretty much given up
on everything else in his life.

947
00:49:09,546 --> 00:49:11,199
He's always made it
clear to me that I

948
00:49:11,212 --> 00:49:13,133
should focus on my life,
focus on my studies

949
00:49:13,134 --> 00:49:15,136
so as to not follow in his footsteps.

950
00:49:15,107 --> 00:49:19,419
He doesn't want me to be slogging
as hard as he is right now.

951
00:49:22,421 --> 00:49:26,898
But the chance to be the best
in the world at something

952
00:49:26,899 --> 00:49:28,150
you don't get it much in life.

953
00:49:42,759 --> 00:49:45,178
I heard my son say

954
00:49:45,272 --> 00:49:47,816
he's working at this, what, Dota.

955
00:49:48,355 --> 00:49:53,366
He spends a lot of time and he gets
nothing. For me, it's very disappointing.

956
00:49:54,052 --> 00:49:56,387
Never goes to school.
He wants to play computer.

957
00:49:56,388 --> 00:50:01,435
Then in the morning, sleep. Then computer
until the next day morning. Then he sleeps.

958
00:50:01,436 --> 00:50:04,478
The whole day at least 15 hours
at the computer a day.

959
00:50:04,989 --> 00:50:09,952
His life, my son's life is like that.

960
00:50:10,581 --> 00:50:16,898
For me, I hope for my son to study more.
Not like me. I never studied.

961
00:50:16,899 --> 00:50:19,383
When I was young, I was
also the same as Han

962
00:50:19,396 --> 00:50:22,001
Yong (hy), always spent
a lot of time to play.

963
00:50:22,002 --> 00:50:24,343
But now I also regret, why I don't study.

964
00:50:24,344 --> 00:50:26,430
But now I'm hoping my son
continues to study

965
00:50:26,080 --> 00:50:27,581
to get an education better than me.

966
00:50:29,974 --> 00:50:31,045
This is my hope.

967
00:50:34,048 --> 00:50:36,620
Having reached the final day
of the tournament,

968
00:50:36,709 --> 00:50:40,083
Benedict has missed two exams and
must repeat his last semester of school.

969
00:50:40,084 --> 00:50:43,635
His team is one win away
from the Grand Finals.

970
00:50:44,216 --> 00:50:46,552
I want to win this badly.

971
00:50:47,366 --> 00:50:49,618
Are you ready for EHOME?

972
00:50:51,978 --> 00:50:54,064
We'll do whatever we can.

973
00:50:54,939 --> 00:50:57,775
For hy, I feel it was a great choice
- a brilliant choice.

974
00:50:57,944 --> 00:50:59,570
Because he was considering
that we could have won.

975
00:51:00,585 --> 00:51:02,606
It's an opportunity that
you shouldn't miss out.

976
00:51:03,458 --> 00:51:07,420
So, get ready, sign in, log in,
play around, test a little bit,

977
00:51:07,079 --> 00:51:09,248
and then join the lobby in about 4 minutes.

978
00:51:11,775 --> 00:51:13,318
It's a once-in-a-lifetime chance.

979
00:51:14,732 --> 00:51:17,485
If you miss it, it might be gone forever.
You might not experience it again.

980
00:51:18,094 --> 00:51:20,112
And we have a rematch.

981
00:51:20,239 --> 00:51:21,866
EHOME versus Scythe.

982
00:51:21,867 --> 00:51:23,702
EHOME facing up against the team
that forced them into the lower bracket.

983
00:51:25,706 --> 00:51:30,252
The psychological pressure is immense,
especially upon the drafter.

984
00:51:30,590 --> 00:51:35,428
Because he is the one who is in the end
responsible for the team's picks.

985
00:51:41,087 --> 00:51:42,185
No, no, no, no, no.

986
00:51:42,186 --> 00:51:43,661
No, no. Don't say no!

987
00:51:43,104 --> 00:51:44,201
No, no. Trust me. No.

988
00:51:46,121 --> 00:51:46,854
Wait, wait, wait.

989
00:51:47,566 --> 00:51:49,192
Tell me this. You really want it?

990
00:51:49,193 --> 00:51:50,194
I really think

991
00:51:50,195 --> 00:51:53,673
It's the Antimage and SF (Shadow Fiend).

992
00:51:53,674 --> 00:51:54,675
That's what I think.

993
00:51:55,154 --> 00:52:00,493
Shadow Fiend? Alrighty then.
It's hyhy as SF.

994
00:52:00,494 --> 00:52:02,746
Everyone knows how to
counter a Shadow Fiend.

995
00:52:02,747 --> 00:52:05,875
It's a very bold pickup here by Scythe.

996
00:52:05,876 --> 00:52:10,214
The fact, if Scythe wins the early game,
they're going to gain so much momentum,

997
00:52:10,215 --> 00:52:12,419
but if they don't, then
EHOME will basically

998
00:52:12,432 --> 00:52:14,303
roll themselves into
the Grand Final.

999
00:52:15,606 --> 00:52:17,785
hyhy, BKB (Black King Bar) is going
to wear off pretty soon,

1000
00:52:17,786 --> 00:52:19,329
Venomancer, great strike!

1001
00:52:19,330 --> 00:52:20,331
hy's dead!

1002
00:52:20,637 --> 00:52:23,336
Stay in the trees now!

1003
00:52:23,337 --> 00:52:24,426
And he wants xy-, he catches up to him.

1004
00:52:25,228 --> 00:52:26,312
And he brings him down.

1005
00:52:26,459 --> 00:52:29,124
Hey! I told you to stay in the trees!

1006
00:52:29,785 --> 00:52:31,078
Why'd you come out?

1007
00:52:33,091 --> 00:52:35,950
Stay in the trees! I told you.

1008
00:52:36,077 --> 00:52:37,829
What an ulti! He Cogs!

1009
00:52:38,613 --> 00:52:41,949
Chawy, he wants to leap,
but there is just no Mana!

1010
00:52:42,443 --> 00:52:43,532
I already told you.

1011
00:52:50,625 --> 00:52:51,876
I told you. Do you understand?

1012
00:52:51,877 --> 00:52:53,321
It's ok. Take it easy.

1013
00:52:53,070 --> 00:52:54,855
If he can pop off an ulti
like that, he doesn't

1014
00:52:54,868 --> 00:52:56,364
have to reveal himself
to his opponent.

1015
00:52:56,617 --> 00:52:58,287
He can really just initiate.

1016
00:52:58,288 --> 00:53:00,552
Oh, there he goes! hyhy doesn't manage
to pop off an ultimate.

1017
00:53:00,094 --> 00:53:00,861
Nice!

1018
00:53:02,855 --> 00:53:03,876
Nice!

1019
00:53:06,174 --> 00:53:07,776
There are already three gone.

1020
00:53:07,777 --> 00:53:08,611
Make that four.

1021
00:53:08,612 --> 00:53:09,683
It's a double-kill for the Anti-mage.

1022
00:53:10,071 --> 00:53:11,142
And they're headed for the tower right now.

1023
00:53:12,034 --> 00:53:16,372
There is a GG Good Game called by hyhy.

1024
00:53:16,076 --> 00:53:17,133
Scythe have had enough now.

1025
00:53:17,944 --> 00:53:19,278
EHOME will advance.

1026
00:53:19,279 --> 00:53:21,211
The Chinese hopes will stay alive

1027
00:53:21,212 --> 00:53:25,557
as they will go up against Na'Vi
with a one game disadvantage.

1028
00:53:46,922 --> 00:53:48,594
The first-placing was very important to me.

1029
00:53:49,909 --> 00:53:54,247
And to add on to that, my studies were also
at the same time affected by everything.

1030
00:53:54,248 --> 00:53:55,810
So everything was related.

1031
00:53:56,115 --> 00:53:58,534
When everything comes falling down
at the same time

1032
00:53:59,932 --> 00:54:01,760
it's quite hard to handle.

1033
00:54:03,320 --> 00:54:04,238
Things are all changed.

1034
00:54:05,015 --> 00:54:06,111
So you gotta plan your life again.

1035
00:54:06,976 --> 00:54:07,727
All over again.

1036
00:54:10,050 --> 00:54:11,259
I've learned a lot.

1037
00:54:12,047 --> 00:54:13,674
You've gotta realize your flaws.

1038
00:54:14,418 --> 00:54:15,586
That's the toughest part, I feel.

1039
00:54:16,647 --> 00:54:18,441
I don't do things as well alone.

1040
00:54:18,568 --> 00:54:20,779
So if you try to do everything by yourself,

1041
00:54:20,780 --> 00:54:22,406
it's not going to be possible, you know.

1042
00:54:23,436 --> 00:54:25,438
I'm actually a believer of fate, and

1043
00:54:25,439 --> 00:54:27,942
I told myself that winning isn't necessary

1044
00:54:27,943 --> 00:54:29,695
because there are so many
more things in life.

1045
00:54:30,118 --> 00:54:31,745
How you take care of the people you love.

1046
00:54:33,565 --> 00:54:36,360
I think that's a very big thing.
That's a very important thing.

1047
00:54:37,773 --> 00:54:40,275
It's the most important thing ever.

1048
00:54:46,381 --> 00:54:47,382
Catch these guys.

1049
00:54:48,448 --> 00:54:49,366
It's not fair.

1050
00:54:49,851 --> 00:54:50,862
Catch these guys.

1051
00:54:51,332 --> 00:54:53,175
I just woke up. It's not fair.

1052
00:54:55,136 --> 00:54:56,929
My haircut

1053
00:54:56,930 --> 00:54:58,056
still

1054
00:54:58,057 --> 00:54:58,725
crazy.

1055
00:54:58,726 --> 00:54:59,351
No?

1056
00:55:00,915 --> 00:55:02,000
But I don't care.

1057
00:55:02,583 --> 00:55:04,126
Ok, I have everything with me.

1058
00:55:05,037 --> 00:55:06,163
Let's go.

1059
00:55:08,700 --> 00:55:10,694
We are now at the final day

1060
00:55:10,695 --> 00:55:13,323
of The International Dota 2 Championships.

1061
00:55:13,072 --> 00:55:14,073
It is Na'Vi.

1062
00:55:14,326 --> 00:55:15,452
They have a one game advantage.

1063
00:55:15,453 --> 00:55:18,748
Sitting very, very sweetly
in the Grand Final.

1064
00:55:18,749 --> 00:55:22,086
Who will get a shot
at the one million dollars?

1065
00:55:22,836 --> 00:55:25,719
Na'Vi was running the same strategy
the whole time

1066
00:55:25,720 --> 00:55:27,847
and no one seemed to be able to counter it.

1067
00:55:28,627 --> 00:55:31,505
Na'Vi loves pushing from minute 10

1068
00:55:31,506 --> 00:55:32,602
and trying to end the game at minute 15.

1069
00:55:34,092 --> 00:55:36,219
Those strategies are very sensitive

1070
00:55:36,220 --> 00:55:37,806
because if you fail even once

1071
00:55:37,807 --> 00:55:40,352
it can become a very
difficult game for you.

1072
00:55:40,693 --> 00:55:43,821
EHOME has been known for how well
they defend their base

1073
00:55:43,822 --> 00:55:46,889
So if there was a team that could stop
Na'Vi's push it would be EHOME.

1074
00:55:47,717 --> 00:55:48,763
And let's get this game underway.

1075
00:55:49,178 --> 00:55:50,274
The players will start to
pick up their heroes

1076
00:55:51,139 --> 00:55:53,058
with one million dollars at stake.

1077
00:55:53,534 --> 00:55:54,605
Na'Vi need to win two.

1078
00:55:55,122 --> 00:55:56,999
EHOME need to win three.

1079
00:56:01,694 --> 00:56:06,573
Running a very, very old school strategy
with three core heroes.

1080
00:56:06,574 --> 00:56:09,703
EHOME managed to survive
Na'Vi's onslaught early.

1081
00:56:09,906 --> 00:56:11,158
It's all on Dendi.

1082
00:56:11,159 --> 00:56:12,785
PLT TP's himself in.

1083
00:56:12,786 --> 00:56:14,464
Dendi on the retreat back out to the tower.

1084
00:56:14,087 --> 00:56:15,380
Will he get himself away?

1085
00:56:15,759 --> 00:56:16,677
X!! Yes, there it is.

1086
00:56:16,678 --> 00:56:20,835
Last hit, 357, the Venomancer
brings down Dendi in the middle.

1087
00:56:21,868 --> 00:56:24,659
Every time you see Dendi perform
he's always playing very well

1088
00:56:24,660 --> 00:56:26,552
and he usually doesn't lose his lanes.

1089
00:56:26,553 --> 00:56:29,107
So, Dendi, his impatience is that

1090
00:56:29,108 --> 00:56:31,319
Chinese teams, they are patient.

1091
00:56:31,320 --> 00:56:35,574
They look out for the fact that
you might cross a line

1092
00:56:35,098 --> 00:56:38,602
and they will take you and kill you
and win the game through those situations.

1093
00:56:39,333 --> 00:56:41,582
Trouble in the mid lane again.
There's already the Gush.

1094
00:56:41,583 --> 00:56:44,628
357, PLT, everyone is right
on top of Dendi.

1095
00:56:44,629 --> 00:56:45,675
He's in the wrong place.

1096
00:56:46,090 --> 00:56:49,378
And the way Na'Vi played,
they really gambled basically.

1097
00:56:51,590 --> 00:56:53,759
Dendi's really been ganked, just shut down.

1098
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:56,388
And not a single kill to his name as well.

1099
00:56:56,970 --> 00:56:59,848
Now Na'Vi going to assault inside the base

1100
00:56:59,849 --> 00:57:02,425
Watch Artstyle. Tier 3 tower. VS Swap!

1101
00:57:02,084 --> 00:57:03,252
Artstyle's in the wrong place!

1102
00:57:03,595 --> 00:57:05,354
Doom there as well!
BKB's both popping off!

1103
00:57:05,355 --> 00:57:07,744
Ravage will pop from LighTofHeaveN
unable to affect EHOME.

1104
00:57:07,745 --> 00:57:08,964
Pudge will go down.

1105
00:57:08,965 --> 00:57:09,924
They want to be initiated on.

1106
00:57:09,925 --> 00:57:12,684
Na'Vi, they need to fall back.

1107
00:57:12,685 --> 00:57:14,690
They take your little upsets

1108
00:57:14,115 --> 00:57:16,617
and just win the game
through those mistakes.

1109
00:57:17,945 --> 00:57:19,922
"GG" from Na'Vi!

1110
00:57:20,090 --> 00:57:25,608
EHOME are celebrating right now
inside the booth. Na'Vi cannot believe it!

1111
00:57:26,215 --> 00:57:28,651
They've dominated this
tournament up till now,

1112
00:57:28,664 --> 00:57:31,215
and EHOME takes the first
match so convincingly.

1113
00:57:31,089 --> 00:57:33,883
That was the first loss of Na'Vi
during the whole tournament.

1114
00:57:34,271 --> 00:57:36,607
They went undefeated until the Grand Final.

1115
00:57:36,608 --> 00:57:39,669
We're going to have a 15-minute break
and be right back here soon.

1116
00:57:39,670 --> 00:57:42,464
Na'Vi, they need to compose themselves.

1117
00:57:42,619 --> 00:57:45,455
EHOME, well, they just need to be awesome

1118
00:57:45,087 --> 00:57:46,820
What a play by them!

1119
00:57:47,113 --> 00:57:49,349
Any loss actually makes me pretty sad.

1120
00:58:00,904 --> 00:58:02,572
Dendi's Home

1121
00:58:02,573 --> 00:58:04,784
L'viv, Ukraine

1122
00:58:04,785 --> 00:58:08,038
We tried to put family pictures here.

1123
00:58:09,178 --> 00:58:11,139
This is our mom and dad.

1124
00:58:11,140 --> 00:58:14,601
And I think that this one
is our favorite actually.

1125
00:58:17,944 --> 00:58:21,031
My childhood, we lived a poor life

1126
00:58:21,032 --> 00:58:25,161
and Dad was working for all our lives.

1127
00:58:26,219 --> 00:58:29,222
But he helped us every time
and every problem.

1128
00:58:31,100 --> 00:58:33,018
I just ask him and he'll do everything

1129
00:58:33,019 --> 00:58:35,655
for me, for Katya, for Danil as well.

1130
00:58:37,333 --> 00:58:41,212
But Danil and Father were like friends.

1131
00:58:42,294 --> 00:58:44,213
Indeed my husband was

1132
00:58:44,585 --> 00:58:46,462
simply a fanatical fisherman.

1133
00:58:46,926 --> 00:58:53,975
Danil was, I would say, his best student.

1134
00:58:54,462 --> 00:59:00,986
Danil has the same patience
and control as his dad.

1135
00:59:00,141 --> 00:59:04,945
He could sit for hours and watch the bobber

1136
00:59:05,792 --> 00:59:07,669
that wouldn't even twitch.

1137
00:59:09,359 --> 00:59:12,654
They could sit with no speaking for hours.

1138
00:59:12,655 --> 00:59:15,449
And just enjoy each other's company.

1139
00:59:15,825 --> 00:59:18,452
They understood each other without words.

1140
00:59:21,746 --> 00:59:25,082
One day I was going fishing, but

1141
00:59:25,083 --> 00:59:27,711
Dad never showed up.

1142
00:59:27,712 --> 00:59:29,800
When I came home it was already super late.

1143
00:59:31,019 --> 00:59:33,605
He was feeling bad.

1144
00:59:33,606 --> 00:59:37,694
He went to the hospital. He decided to

1145
00:59:38,531 --> 00:59:43,544
stay for a few weeks, you know,
so we watch everything, stuff like this.

1146
00:59:44,264 --> 00:59:45,632
And

1147
00:59:46,267 --> 00:59:46,363
cancer.

1148
00:59:50,297 --> 00:59:52,258
It was a very big shock for me

1149
00:59:52,259 --> 00:59:54,135
because he was very thin.

1150
00:59:54,096 --> 00:59:56,163
I cannot understand that this is my father.

1151
00:59:57,696 --> 01:00:00,490
We were all sure that it must be okay.

1152
01:00:01,001 --> 01:00:04,129
But it was a very short time.

1153
01:00:05,861 --> 01:00:08,113
I was really sad and was

1154
01:00:08,456 --> 01:00:11,251
crying a lot.

1155
01:00:11,252 --> 01:00:12,621
I was upset about

1156
01:00:12,622 --> 01:00:17,251
I couldn't say to him, many times,
how much I loved him.

1157
01:00:20,021 --> 01:00:23,649
After his dad passed away,

1158
01:00:23,650 --> 01:00:25,611
he hasn't gone fishing once.

1159
01:00:25,144 --> 01:00:26,687
Not even once.

1160
01:00:27,552 --> 01:00:32,561
For now this is all in the past.

1161
01:00:35,506 --> 01:00:38,624
Actually I spent more time near
the computer because

1162
01:00:38,625 --> 01:00:40,656
I could not think about it.

1163
01:00:41,065 --> 01:00:42,942
It's like a distractor.

1164
01:00:43,096 --> 01:00:45,223
It was like a start time, actually.

1165
01:00:45,483 --> 01:00:47,818
The push to play more.

1166
01:00:48,601 --> 01:00:51,604
And that's maybe one of the reasons
why I'm playing now.

1167
01:00:52,266 --> 01:00:53,893
Maybe I wouldn't play at all.

1168
01:00:54,840 --> 01:00:59,679
The relationship of Danil and my mom
grew stronger these days.

1169
01:01:00,001 --> 01:01:01,836
They support each other.

1170
01:01:02,213 --> 01:01:04,590
and they are very good friends.

1171
01:01:04,591 --> 01:01:07,553
I think that this is very important
for Danil.

1172
01:01:09,083 --> 01:01:11,794
You know, five years ago,
I wouldn't care about many things.

1173
01:01:13,183 --> 01:01:15,686
Now, I'm thinking about it a lot.

1174
01:01:16,988 --> 01:01:19,240
Something knocks you down,

1175
01:01:19,241 --> 01:01:20,909
you need to learn to get up.

1176
01:01:21,074 --> 01:01:24,870
So I'm trying to research this.

1177
01:01:27,896 --> 01:01:29,355
To learn to get up.

1178
01:01:32,680 --> 01:01:34,609
This is the most important moment
in my life

1179
01:01:34,610 --> 01:01:37,655
because everything I worked on
wasn't useful.

1180
01:01:37,867 --> 01:01:42,831
And now I have a chance to win
this tournament for my family.

1181
01:01:44,610 --> 01:01:48,646
So we have currently EHOME and Na'Vi
playing the Grand Finals.

1182
01:01:49,411 --> 01:01:51,872
Na'Vi just lost one game versus EHOME

1183
01:01:52,030 --> 01:01:52,818
and it's 1-1.

1184
01:01:52,126 --> 01:01:56,908
So both teams have to win two matches
in order to win the one million dollars.

1185
01:01:59,158 --> 01:02:02,286
Because our picks looked completely
different, we were like passive and stuff.

1186
01:02:02,287 --> 01:02:04,085
People thought we lost the first game,

1187
01:02:04,086 --> 01:02:05,295
we're going to lose the second game.

1188
01:02:05,664 --> 01:02:07,833
We were maybe a little bit demoralized.

1189
01:02:07,834 --> 01:02:11,003
We really needed to change
to a different pick.

1190
01:02:11,004 --> 01:02:12,381
We were missing something.

1191
01:02:12,782 --> 01:02:14,149
We picked Enigma just

1192
01:02:14,150 --> 01:02:16,009
to have a strong teamfight

1193
01:02:15,146 --> 01:02:16,974
a five versus five combat.

1194
01:02:20,352 --> 01:02:21,770
It was, like, the last hero left

1195
01:02:21,771 --> 01:02:23,565
and I never played it before.

1196
01:02:24,089 --> 01:02:26,508
Then, we're, like, "Dendi, you go!"

1197
01:02:26,711 --> 01:02:29,103
And he's, like,
"Guys, I've never played it!"

1198
01:02:29,104 --> 01:02:30,481
"But, I can do it!"

1199
01:02:31,137 --> 01:02:32,685
So we took the risk of taking him

1200
01:02:32,686 --> 01:02:35,147
and risking maybe playing him badly.

1201
01:02:35,477 --> 01:02:39,022
So it looks like down on that bottom lane,
Dendi will be taking the Enigma.

1202
01:02:39,023 --> 01:02:41,567
It is going to be a very, very rough lane

1203
01:02:41,745 --> 01:02:42,773
Na'Vi lost the game.

1204
01:02:42,774 --> 01:02:44,838
And they're playing something now
that they're not as confident with.

1205
01:02:45,415 --> 01:02:48,086
EHOME figured out Na'Vi.
Figured out how to play against it.

1206
01:02:48,087 --> 01:02:51,058
And I'm going to stick to my word
and I'm going to say EHOME will win it.

1207
01:02:51,059 --> 01:02:53,640
It was incredibly ballsy from Dendi
to do that

1208
01:02:53,641 --> 01:02:56,978
on the verge of winning the million dollars
for your team.

1209
01:02:57,651 --> 01:03:06,065
That's very, very stupid. That's suicidal.

1210
01:03:07,092 --> 01:03:08,174
Dendi really now caught out.

1211
01:03:08,913 --> 01:03:09,831
He's in trouble.

1212
01:03:10,153 --> 01:03:10,904
Rockets to fly in.

1213
01:03:10,905 --> 01:03:13,783
FCB long way in on the tower,
lands the stun.

1214
01:03:13,784 --> 01:03:15,536
Tinker just lasers him to death.

1215
01:03:15,537 --> 01:03:17,300
It will cost FCB his life.

1216
01:03:17,326 --> 01:03:19,537
Then we made some little mistakes.

1217
01:03:19,538 --> 01:03:22,693
We played a really semi type of, like,
"turtle" strategy.

1218
01:03:22,694 --> 01:03:24,145
Really passive. Really passive.

1219
01:03:24,146 --> 01:03:25,217
We don't play like that.

1220
01:03:25,218 --> 01:03:26,257
Puppey and Dendi just want
to retreat back out.

1221
01:03:26,609 --> 01:03:29,112
820! What a Fissure!

1222
01:03:29,113 --> 01:03:30,322
PLT is there!

1223
01:03:30,323 --> 01:03:31,741
Echo Slam as well!

1224
01:03:31,742 --> 01:03:33,898
Beautiful play there by EHOME.

1225
01:03:34,159 --> 01:03:36,106
But I know if I die,

1226
01:03:36,107 --> 01:03:37,692
I die not for nothing.

1227
01:03:38,038 --> 01:03:38,997
X!! in the middle lane

1228
01:03:38,998 --> 01:03:40,917
Force, Rocket, Laser.

1229
01:03:40,918 --> 01:03:42,044
It's enough!

1230
01:03:42,045 --> 01:03:44,089
Dendi goes down in the middle lane.

1231
01:03:45,715 --> 01:03:48,051
Sometimes it can be like, you dying

1232
01:03:48,052 --> 01:03:50,221
but your teammates picking up more.

1233
01:03:50,097 --> 01:03:51,168
EHOME, they still want
to push out that mid

1234
01:03:52,222 --> 01:03:54,766
They weren't ready for Dendi Enigma.

1235
01:03:54,767 --> 01:03:56,694
It was a patient Enigma.

1236
01:03:56,695 --> 01:03:58,386
That was the most patient
Enigma in the world.

1237
01:03:58,387 --> 01:03:59,153
Puppey is here.

1238
01:03:59,154 --> 01:03:59,247
Dendi as well.

1239
01:03:59,885 --> 01:04:01,408
Going to look for the Hole.

1240
01:04:01,443 --> 01:04:03,140
BLACK HOLE!!!!

1241
01:04:05,128 --> 01:04:07,300
Three are going to go down for EHOME

1242
01:04:07,076 --> 01:04:10,043
Currently, Na'Vi, they have
the advantage now.

1243
01:04:10,269 --> 01:04:13,401
That really impresses me
how he's able to make that transition.

1244
01:04:13,402 --> 01:04:15,343
You just have to have the balls, basically.

1245
01:04:15,575 --> 01:04:16,826
He was scared of losing.

1246
01:04:16,827 --> 01:04:19,163
That's why he was so patient
and he did everything right.

1247
01:04:20,217 --> 01:04:23,220
Their strategy is kind of similar
to how EHOME won.

1248
01:04:24,073 --> 01:04:26,117
Na'Vi defeated them "Late Game."

1249
01:04:26,118 --> 01:04:28,210
And I think this really shattered
EHOME's confidence.

1250
01:04:29,844 --> 01:04:32,221
And "GG" is the call from EHOME.

1251
01:04:32,222 --> 01:04:34,391
Na'Vi, they take the game.

1252
01:04:34,392 --> 01:04:38,730
And they are only one win short
of taking home one million dollars.

1253
01:04:41,074 --> 01:04:43,577
We hardly won the second game.

1254
01:04:43,146 --> 01:04:45,238
Chinese teams generally are feared
for their "Late Game" potential.

1255
01:04:46,950 --> 01:04:48,143
So we hit the point now.

1256
01:04:48,144 --> 01:04:49,183
The gloves come off.

1257
01:04:49,184 --> 01:04:54,445
EHOME, they will master their knowledge,
their experience, their calls

1258
01:04:54,616 --> 01:04:56,675
up against Na'Vi.

1259
01:04:56,719 --> 01:04:58,857
And Puck will be the last hero for Na'Vi.

1260
01:04:58,858 --> 01:05:00,777
The nimble hero there already.

1261
01:05:00,778 --> 01:05:02,781
Once again a lot of aggressive heroes
for themselves.

1262
01:05:03,079 --> 01:05:05,741
Na'Vi LighTofHeaveN playing
as the Beastmaster again

1263
01:05:05,121 --> 01:05:06,956
with Dendi playing as the Puck this time.

1264
01:05:08,086 --> 01:05:09,824
If Na'Vi wins this,

1265
01:05:09,825 --> 01:05:12,114
they win the whole tournament.

1266
01:05:12,478 --> 01:05:14,897
This Clash of the Titans right here

1267
01:05:14,898 --> 01:05:15,969
is something we will not want to miss.

1268
01:05:16,875 --> 01:05:17,921
X!! will come in closer.

1269
01:05:18,336 --> 01:05:19,545
They will be able to get that kill.

1270
01:05:19,765 --> 01:05:20,786
Doom now on Dendi.

1271
01:05:20,976 --> 01:05:25,367
Pulled in by X!!
The entire EHOME team turns on him.

1272
01:05:25,515 --> 01:05:27,252
Lich will go down.

1273
01:05:27,253 --> 01:05:28,279
FCB is on the run.

1274
01:05:28,280 --> 01:05:30,048
XBOCT after the chase of him.

1275
01:05:30,049 --> 01:05:31,425
Might be enough. Needs some more damage.

1276
01:05:31,426 --> 01:05:33,493
Storm! X!! Long jump in.

1277
01:05:34,097 --> 01:05:35,515
Dendi Orbing up to the high ground.

1278
01:05:35,516 --> 01:05:37,601
FCB! Puts on the Rift.

1279
01:05:37,107 --> 01:05:38,776
Will he be able to get the kill?
He's on the retreat.

1280
01:05:39,074 --> 01:05:40,700
Yes, it is.
Dendi with the last right click.

1281
01:05:41,165 --> 01:05:43,459
EHOME now, they're gonna
rotate themselves down.

1282
01:05:43,460 --> 01:05:45,045
Na'Vi already in the pit.

1283
01:05:45,046 --> 01:05:47,715
They're trying to bring down Roshan
- all 5.

1284
01:05:47,716 --> 01:05:48,787
Dendi! He's gonna jump out!

1285
01:05:49,427 --> 01:05:51,179
He goes for the Dream Coil! He gets them!

1286
01:05:51,180 --> 01:05:53,933
He gets EHOME!
Holds them in the middle lane.

1287
01:05:53,934 --> 01:05:56,186
Na'Vi already on their way out of the pit.

1288
01:05:56,187 --> 01:05:58,272
They're coming in to help out Dendi.

1289
01:05:58,273 --> 01:06:01,235
Then we just went in and demolished them.

1290
01:06:03,166 --> 01:06:05,412
Now they're on top of the Tier 3 tower.

1291
01:06:05,413 --> 01:06:08,925
They're going to bring it down.
Yes, it does go down.

1292
01:06:08,926 --> 01:06:11,632
EHOME, they're trying desperately to defend

1293
01:06:11,633 --> 01:06:14,107
but Na'Vi, the onslaught will continue.

1294
01:06:14,108 --> 01:06:15,945
The mid tower's already being pushed.

1295
01:06:15,946 --> 01:06:17,883
The Tier 4 tower is going to go down.

1296
01:06:17,884 --> 01:06:20,472
And running in right now
is the rest of Na'Vi.

1297
01:06:20,095 --> 01:06:22,461
They are running forward
to one million dollars.

1298
01:06:22,840 --> 01:06:24,037
And they will get it!

1299
01:06:24,038 --> 01:06:26,583
The "GG" is the call from EHOME.

1300
01:06:26,646 --> 01:06:31,065
Na'Vi have just won one million dollars.

1301
01:06:31,376 --> 01:06:36,131
EHOME do take home $250,000
in second place.

1302
01:06:36,132 --> 01:06:38,844
But Na'Vi are the champions!

1303
01:06:40,522 --> 01:06:42,858
There's moments of E Sports
that are landmark,

1304
01:06:42,859 --> 01:06:45,187
and this is one of them. In Cologne.

1305
01:06:45,188 --> 01:06:47,232
And Na'Vi, the winners.

1306
01:06:47,071 --> 01:06:49,406
You guys have just made history.

1307
01:06:58,974 --> 01:07:01,287
I was jumping on the sofa.

1308
01:07:01,288 --> 01:07:04,750
And screaming like a crazy girl

1309
01:07:05,197 --> 01:07:07,283
because I was the happiest
girl in the world.

1310
01:07:07,284 --> 01:07:10,536
And my brother just won
one million dollars!

1311
01:07:20,421 --> 01:07:21,798
I think in 10 years time

1312
01:07:21,799 --> 01:07:24,726
all the gamers which we currently have
showing themselves,

1313
01:07:25,055 --> 01:07:26,890
they're going to be the guys
we will look back at and say

1314
01:07:26,909 --> 01:07:27,868
this was the beginning.

1315
01:07:27,869 --> 01:07:28,890
This is where it all started.

1316
01:07:29,558 --> 01:07:31,226
These are the guys that worked hard

1317
01:07:31,849 --> 01:07:32,870
and they took the risk.

1318
01:07:33,117 --> 01:07:34,767
They proved themselves.

1319
01:07:35,821 --> 01:07:38,198
And they forwarded the entire industry
to the point where

1320
01:07:38,199 --> 01:07:39,283
we could have a kick-start.

1321
01:07:39,077 --> 01:07:40,871
We could show the world what we do.

1322
01:07:41,415 --> 01:07:44,668
And then who knows how big
we could get at that point.

1323
01:07:47,061 --> 01:07:48,979
We've come far already.

1324
01:07:49,450 --> 01:07:50,888
When more and more people support it

1325
01:07:50,889 --> 01:07:52,387
and it becomes more and more normal,

1326
01:07:52,388 --> 01:07:56,696
it's going to go from a niche
to becoming accepted in societies.

1327
01:07:57,408 --> 01:08:00,995
I think in 15 years,
E Sports will be bigger than football.

1328
01:08:01,319 --> 01:08:02,654
Than basketball. Than everything.

1329
01:08:03,087 --> 01:08:06,238
That kid who you thought played
too many video games

1330
01:08:06,239 --> 01:08:08,700
is potentially going to be on a path

1331
01:08:08,701 --> 01:08:13,190
where he's earning $250,000 a year, salary.

1332
01:08:13,191 --> 01:08:14,609
He's flying the world.

1333
01:08:14,610 --> 01:08:16,404
He's going to be endorsed.

1334
01:08:16,893 --> 01:08:19,645
Gaming's the biggest entertainment
industry in the world.

1335
01:08:19,897 --> 01:08:20,968
So if you're a star,

1336
01:08:21,610 --> 01:08:24,946
you are potentially one of
the biggest stars in the world.

1337
01:08:25,775 --> 01:08:29,820
So, if that, like everything else with
computers grows exponentially or whatever

1338
01:08:29,821 --> 01:08:32,532
then 5 or 10 years could be
a big step actually.

1339
01:08:33,172 --> 01:08:35,007
Changing mindsets is never easy.

1340
01:08:35,277 --> 01:08:36,348
So it's going to take awhile.

1341
01:08:36,988 --> 01:08:39,866
When the gamers now become parents,

1342
01:08:40,055 --> 01:08:42,644
we will be supportive of our kids playing,

1343
01:08:42,123 --> 01:08:45,376
and I think that's really when
everything will boom.

1344
01:08:52,957 --> 01:08:56,192
"The only thing achieved in life
without effort is failure"

1345
01:08:59,683 --> 01:09:01,184
After weeks of training,

1346
01:09:01,068 --> 01:09:04,655
a local man has led his
online gaming team to the top,

1347
01:09:04,773 --> 01:09:08,277
placing seventh in an international
gaming competition held in Germany.

1348
01:09:09,473 --> 01:09:10,557
Yeah, she's definitely proud of me.

1349
01:09:10,558 --> 01:09:12,151
I mean just, she had her camera out

1350
01:09:12,152 --> 01:09:15,697
like, "Why are taking a photo
of the television?"

1351
01:09:16,894 --> 01:09:19,522
I know she's really smart.
She's a lawyer as well.

1352
01:09:20,072 --> 01:09:22,658
But in the end, I think
she'll be more understanding

1353
01:09:22,736 --> 01:09:24,488
and be willing to support me more

1354
01:09:24,489 --> 01:09:26,074
so it worked out.

1355
01:09:36,463 --> 01:09:37,808
We were disappointed with our loss.

1356
01:09:38,226 --> 01:09:40,133
And, yeah, it's a mixture of both,

1357
01:09:40,134 --> 01:09:41,552
we're happy and sad that we got third.

1358
01:09:42,219 --> 01:09:43,220
Because of all the emotions

1359
01:09:43,238 --> 01:09:45,407
I felt like she was the one
I wanted to share them with.

1360
01:09:45,439 --> 01:09:47,816
And it got pretty clear only then
that I had to get her back.

1361
01:09:48,037 --> 01:09:50,706
After the tournament I actually
went back to look for her,

1362
01:09:51,149 --> 01:09:52,400
and talk things out,

1363
01:09:52,401 --> 01:09:54,493
and we have actually begun dating again.

1364
01:09:55,727 --> 01:09:57,688
And things are actually going great.

1365
01:10:00,098 --> 01:10:01,265
I love her, you know.

1366
01:10:04,138 --> 01:10:06,974
She played a huge role, a very huge part

1367
01:10:07,972 --> 01:10:09,099
in

1368
01:10:09,100 --> 01:10:10,309
in the me today.

1369
01:10:16,975 --> 01:10:19,971
One week ago it was 3,000 followers.

1370
01:10:20,037 --> 01:10:21,128
I was happy.

1371
01:10:21,702 --> 01:10:24,008
Then it's boomed. 8,000 followers.

1372
01:10:24,619 --> 01:10:25,886
It's not about the number.

1373
01:10:26,548 --> 01:10:28,798
Even if it's one or two, I'm fine.

1374
01:10:29,681 --> 01:10:32,532
So you don't need to show numbers actually.

1375
01:10:32,997 --> 01:10:34,263
I think.

1376
01:10:34,757 --> 01:10:37,199
My father, I think,

1377
01:10:37,200 --> 01:10:41,559
didn't have time to understand
what Dendi's doing.

1378
01:10:46,093 --> 01:10:48,367
We lost him too early.

1379
01:10:49,505 --> 01:10:51,583
And if now he could see Dendi,

1380
01:10:52,079 --> 01:10:55,126
I'm sure that he's proud of his son.
