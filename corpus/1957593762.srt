00:00:02,060 --> 00:00:04,893
(MultiCom Jingle)

2
00:00:14,052 --> 00:00:17,052
(light jazzy music)

3
00:00:51,513 --> 00:00:52,346
- Keith?

4
00:00:56,916 --> 00:00:58,583
Keith, are you here?

5
00:01:08,086 --> 00:01:08,959
(answering machine beeping)

6
00:01:08,959 --> 00:01:10,348
- [Woman] Hi honey, it's Mom.

7
00:01:10,348 --> 00:01:12,602
You and Keith must still
be at the doctor's office

8
00:01:12,602 --> 00:01:14,598
but call me as soon as you get in, okay?

9
00:01:14,598 --> 00:01:16,431
I hope it's good news.

10
00:01:25,824 --> 00:01:27,324
- Down, send, hut!

11
00:01:33,223 --> 00:01:34,056
(guys cheering)

12
00:01:34,056 --> 00:01:35,988
Yup, that's all, thank you very much.

13
00:01:35,988 --> 00:01:37,284
Let go of me now.

14
00:01:37,284 --> 00:01:39,629
Yeah you always did like Jack Best.

15
00:01:39,629 --> 00:01:40,465
Good job, man.

16
00:01:40,465 --> 00:01:41,632
Nice job, pal.

17
00:02:01,183 --> 00:02:04,100
(crowd chattering)

18
00:02:18,274 --> 00:02:20,519
There, there, she's looking at me.

19
00:02:20,519 --> 00:02:21,352
- [Keith] Her?

20
00:02:21,352 --> 00:02:22,969
- [Jack] Don't point, man!

21
00:02:22,969 --> 00:02:23,952
Yeah, she's looking at me, there.

22
00:02:23,952 --> 00:02:25,553
- [Keith] I don't think
she's looking at you.

23
00:02:25,553 --> 00:02:26,386
- Yeah, right there.

24
00:02:26,386 --> 00:02:28,070
- [Waiter] Here we go, boys.

25
00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:28,970
- [Both] Wings.

26
00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:30,130
- [Waiter] Tuesday special.

27
00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:30,963
- Excellent.

28
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,130
- Today's not Tuesday.

29
00:02:33,130 --> 00:02:34,353
- All day, buddy, yeah.

30
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,044
- Today is Tuesday?

31
00:02:36,044 --> 00:02:36,877
- Mhmm.

32
00:02:36,877 --> 00:02:37,872
- We gotta go.

33
00:02:37,872 --> 00:02:39,038
- What's the matter?
- Right now,

34
00:02:39,038 --> 00:02:39,871
let's go.
- What?

35
00:02:39,871 --> 00:02:40,825
We just got here, what's the matter?

36
00:02:40,825 --> 00:02:41,994
Who you talking about?

37
00:02:41,994 --> 00:02:43,788
Hey what's going on?

38
00:02:43,788 --> 00:02:45,056
I got to see you next week, man.

39
00:02:45,056 --> 00:02:46,736
- [Waiter] You got it.

40
00:02:46,736 --> 00:02:47,964
(car revving)

41
00:02:47,964 --> 00:02:48,966
- Oh boy.

42
00:02:48,966 --> 00:02:51,808
Well, just be happy there's
no gun in the house.

43
00:02:51,808 --> 00:02:53,840
There's always my couch, buddy.

44
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:54,673
- I may need it.

45
00:02:54,673 --> 00:02:55,624
- Go get 'em!

46
00:02:56,836 --> 00:02:59,336
(car revving)

47
00:03:05,532 --> 00:03:08,615
(tense guitar music)

48
00:03:09,454 --> 00:03:12,204
(floor creaking)

49
00:03:21,691 --> 00:03:22,524
- Hi.

50
00:03:24,218 --> 00:03:25,135
Honey, I...

51
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,772
I'm so sorry.

52
00:03:27,772 --> 00:03:29,050
- You could have at
least called, you know.

53
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:31,300
- I know, I know, I just...

54
00:03:32,279 --> 00:03:33,980
I thought it was Monday.

55
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:34,813
Really, I did.

56
00:03:37,086 --> 00:03:39,180
(woman sighing)

57
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:40,013
So...

58
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:44,253
What happened, what'd this guy say?

59
00:03:45,210 --> 00:03:46,470
- Same thing Dr. Salomon said,

60
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:48,870
that we should start
thinking about adoption.

61
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:50,430
- So then we'll just,

62
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:52,350
we'll adopt, right?

63
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:53,183
No big deal.

64
00:03:54,350 --> 00:03:55,820
Like you said, I mean there's
a million kids out there

65
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:56,730
that need a home.

66
00:03:56,730 --> 00:03:57,880
We'll get the best one.

67
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:03,753
I'm sorry.

68
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:12,250
- You taste like chicken wings.

69
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:14,160
- I like when you talk like that.

70
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,479
- Get away from me, I'm still mad at you.

71
00:04:17,479 --> 00:04:18,633
- No you're not.

72
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:26,083
- Keith?

73
00:04:26,083 --> 00:04:27,443
- [Keith] Yeah, babe?

74
00:04:27,443 --> 00:04:28,542
- I wanna start looking now.

75
00:04:28,542 --> 00:04:29,375
- Okay.

76
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:36,109
Now now?

77
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:37,053
- Yes, now now.

78
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,273
What's wrong?

79
00:04:42,357 --> 00:04:43,190
- Nothing.

80
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:45,710
No, nothing, it just seems kind of sudden.

81
00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:47,220
- No it's not, we've
been trying for a year.

82
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:50,003
- I know, well trying, that's different.

83
00:04:51,169 --> 00:04:53,034
I'm real good at trying.

84
00:04:53,034 --> 00:04:53,970
- You'd be a real good dad

85
00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:55,728
too, Keith.
- Oh, I know, I know.

86
00:04:55,728 --> 00:04:57,648
- I really want a baby, sweety.

87
00:04:57,648 --> 00:04:59,840
You know that, and with
my job and maternity

88
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:00,673
leave now,
- I know.

89
00:05:00,673 --> 00:05:01,506
Let's just wait for you to,

90
00:05:01,506 --> 00:05:03,523
you know, come down off
the fertility pills, okay?

91
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:07,610
- It's not like this is some kind

92
00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:09,190
of irrational decision, Keith.

93
00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:10,100
- I know.

94
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:11,610
I know.

95
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:13,337
- So what do you think?

96
00:05:13,337 --> 00:05:14,737
- Hey where's the pot roast?

97
00:05:22,679 --> 00:05:24,250
(door creaking)

98
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:27,333
(somber piano music)

99
00:05:43,414 --> 00:05:45,010
Are you asleep?

100
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:45,843
- No.

101
00:05:49,321 --> 00:05:51,700
- Listen, I just had this flash

102
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:53,990
when I was down in the kitchen.

103
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:55,240
The pot roast was really good, by the way,

104
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:57,363
way better than my mom's.

105
00:05:58,470 --> 00:06:00,180
Wanna know what it was?

106
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:01,013
It was of me

107
00:06:02,073 --> 00:06:05,293
teaching a little kid
how to pitch a baseball.

108
00:06:06,481 --> 00:06:10,810
- And how did that feel?

109
00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:13,333
- It felt pretty good.

110
00:06:13,333 --> 00:06:16,290
I gotta say, it kind of lit
me up there for a while.

111
00:06:20,109 --> 00:06:21,026
- I'm glad.

112
00:06:31,381 --> 00:06:33,449
- [Jack] No, was she pissed off?

113
00:06:33,449 --> 00:06:35,000
- [Keith] Well, I did make
a good point back then.

114
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,450
- [Jack] Why didn't she beat you?

115
00:06:36,450 --> 00:06:38,160
- [Keith] I got to work.

116
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,010
- You're kidding.

117
00:06:40,102 --> 00:06:42,517
(laughing) Guess you're
not gonna do that again.

118
00:06:42,517 --> 00:06:43,875
- [Keith] Guess I'm not.

119
00:06:43,875 --> 00:06:46,190
- So what, you're gonna
actually look for a kid?

120
00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:47,260
Who's already looking?

121
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:48,093
- She is.

122
00:06:48,093 --> 00:06:50,390
We got a meeting with an
adoption agency next week.

123
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:51,223
- Wow.

124
00:06:51,223 --> 00:06:52,410
How long does that usually take?

125
00:06:52,410 --> 00:06:53,810
- Don't strain yourselves, girls.

126
00:06:53,810 --> 00:06:56,420
Wouldn't want any excuses when
we kick your asses Saturday.

127
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:58,220
- [Jack] Well thanks for
your concern, sweetheart.

128
00:06:58,220 --> 00:06:59,053
Yeah yes.

129
00:06:59,053 --> 00:07:01,057
- [Man] Can I have an aisle search please?

130
00:07:01,057 --> 00:07:02,300
- So you actually think you're ready

131
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:03,750
for this parenting thing huh?

132
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:06,813
- Yeah, I guess.

133
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:08,978
- Big change.

134
00:07:08,978 --> 00:07:10,160
You remember Callis.

135
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,840
He got pretty snowed under.

136
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,080
- Take a look at his wife.

137
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:14,110
- What about Barney?

138
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:15,670
I mean one week he's painting
himself green and yellow

139
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:17,220
for the Packers home opener then nothing.

140
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:18,170
- Will you shut up?

141
00:07:19,266 --> 00:07:20,430
You're starting to sound like my mom.

142
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:21,760
In the first place, Kim is gonna handle

143
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:22,593
all the kid stuff.

144
00:07:22,593 --> 00:07:23,810
It's like she was born to be a mom.

145
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:26,450
And the second, it's not
gonna happen right away.

146
00:07:26,450 --> 00:07:27,610
These things can take years sometimes.

147
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:29,399
- [Man] Hey, hey lady, look out!

148
00:07:29,399 --> 00:07:31,667
- Oh dear, oh, oh.

149
00:07:31,667 --> 00:07:32,668
- No, no.
- Well,

150
00:07:32,668 --> 00:07:34,068
let's hope so for your sake.

151
00:07:48,466 --> 00:07:49,466
- Oh, great.

152
00:07:50,409 --> 00:07:51,242
Oh, great.

153
00:07:51,242 --> 00:07:52,970
Dammit Keith, you better be on your way.

154
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:55,130
- Hey, you seen that new girl in dispatch?

155
00:07:55,130 --> 00:07:56,700
- Oh, here's your problem.

156
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:58,420
Here's why you're leaking oil anyway.

157
00:07:58,420 --> 00:08:00,350
Your drain plug is cross-threaded.

158
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:01,183
- Well you seen her?

159
00:08:01,183 --> 00:08:02,016
- Who?
- Judy?

160
00:08:02,016 --> 00:08:02,849
- Yeah, that's her.
(pager beeping)

161
00:08:02,849 --> 00:08:03,723
- [Keith] That my beeper?

162
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:07,403
- It's Kim.

163
00:08:07,403 --> 00:08:08,890
(oil squishing)

164
00:08:08,890 --> 00:08:11,043
- Just a bit more tea for you.

165
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:13,793
And let's see.

166
00:08:15,347 --> 00:08:18,240
- [Old Woman] Why don't
we just get started, okay?

167
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,750
- Okay, yeah, he's probably just tied up

168
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:20,770
in traffic, that's all.

169
00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:23,567
- I see by your application
that you're a speech therapist

170
00:08:23,567 --> 00:08:24,810
for the school district.

171
00:08:24,810 --> 00:08:25,779
- Yes, that's right.

172
00:08:25,779 --> 00:08:28,660
(tires screeching)
(car revving)

173
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:30,470
- I don't see any life
insurance listed here.

174
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:31,770
You're both gonna need some.

175
00:08:31,770 --> 00:08:33,300
- Yeah, my husband's definitely gonna need

176
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:35,230
life insurance after today.

177
00:08:35,230 --> 00:08:37,350
(car revving)

178
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:38,960
- Of course it's
important that the husband

179
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:41,147
be just as committed to the
adoption as the wife is.

180
00:08:41,147 --> 00:08:41,980
- Mhmm.

181
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:44,553
- That's why we don't allow
single parent adoptions.

182
00:08:44,553 --> 00:08:45,960
- Right.

183
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:49,200
(tires screeching)

184
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,340
- That must be him.

185
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:52,033
- Yes, it is, speak of the devil.

186
00:08:55,872 --> 00:08:57,305
(door slamming)

187
00:08:57,305 --> 00:09:02,163
- [Keith] Hi.

188
00:09:02,163 --> 00:09:05,249
(water splashing)

189
00:09:05,249 --> 00:09:08,082
(dishes clanking)

190
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:15,120
- Really not ready for
this, are you, Keith?

191
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,113
- Sure, I am.

192
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:20,000
I am.

193
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,268
- You've thought about it.

194
00:09:21,268 --> 00:09:23,660
- Yeah, I thought about it.

195
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:26,540
- Well so where does having
a baby rank with say,

196
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:28,160
playing football and playing golf

197
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,660
and hanging out with the guys?

198
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,410
- It's above football and
hanging out with the guys

199
00:09:32,410 --> 00:09:33,410
and just below golf.

200
00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:36,990
Honey, come on, I'm kidding, I am kidding.

201
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:39,070
- I'm not kidding, Keith.

202
00:09:39,070 --> 00:09:41,030
We're talking about having
a child here, you know,

203
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:42,400
being parents for the rest of our lives,

204
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:44,750
and I would really like to
know how you feel about it.

205
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:45,900
- I feel fine about it.

206
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:48,030
- You feel fine?

207
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:49,200
- [Keith] Yeah.

208
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,550
- So why'd you tell Edna
that this was my idea?

209
00:09:53,714 --> 00:09:54,547
- [Jack] So when do you find out

210
00:09:54,547 --> 00:09:55,919
if you totally screwed this thing up?

211
00:09:55,919 --> 00:09:56,990
- [Keith] The approval's on Saturday.

212
00:09:56,990 --> 00:09:57,904
- [Jack] The day of the game?

213
00:09:57,904 --> 00:09:59,270
- Yeah.

214
00:09:59,270 --> 00:10:01,140
The agency's still
checking us out, I guess,

215
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:02,810
driving Kim crazy.

216
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:03,890
She's already emotional as hell

217
00:10:03,890 --> 00:10:04,840
coming off her pills.

218
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:06,950
Her stomach's not bothering her.

219
00:10:06,950 --> 00:10:08,427
I'm beginning to wonder whether
the whole thing's worth it.

220
00:10:08,427 --> 00:10:10,060
- Oh, do not tell her that.

221
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:10,983
- No kidding.

222
00:10:10,983 --> 00:10:11,860
- You two getting along all right?

223
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:12,770
- Yeah, fine.

224
00:10:12,770 --> 00:10:15,266
I mean, then she thinks I'm an
insensitive pig and all, but,

225
00:10:15,266 --> 00:10:16,760
- Yeah, yeah, besides all that.

226
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:19,330
- You know I'll be fine
if we get approved.

227
00:10:19,330 --> 00:10:20,930
I just hope I didn't blow it.

228
00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:22,130
- Hey Loosh!

229
00:10:22,130 --> 00:10:23,460
Saturday, man.

230
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:25,000
Or if you want to save
yourself the trouble,

231
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,699
you can forfeit right now.

232
00:10:26,699 --> 00:10:27,881
(men laughing)

233
00:10:27,881 --> 00:10:29,699
- That guy's an idiot.

234
00:10:29,699 --> 00:10:31,260
- [Jack] We're gonna beat these guys.

235
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:33,518
(whistle blowing)

236
00:10:33,518 --> 00:10:36,685
(players chattering)

237
00:10:38,714 --> 00:10:41,381
- [Man] Get it on the next play!

238
00:10:43,593 --> 00:10:45,760
- [Woman] Way to go, guys.

239
00:10:48,059 --> 00:10:49,557
Come on, guys.

240
00:10:49,557 --> 00:10:52,057
- All right, down, check, git!

241
00:10:53,079 --> 00:10:55,215
- One speedball, two
speedball, three speedball,

242
00:10:55,215 --> 00:10:56,599
four speedball, five speedball.

243
00:10:56,599 --> 00:11:00,997
Ooh yes, ladies and
gentlemen, 14 zip, hah!

244
00:11:00,997 --> 00:11:03,130
And the chump can't even
get it over the line.

245
00:11:03,130 --> 00:11:03,963
- She beep?

246
00:11:06,330 --> 00:11:07,950
- [Friend] No, man, I told
you I'd tell you right away.

247
00:11:07,950 --> 00:11:09,320
- It's important, we're
supposed to find out today

248
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,153
about the kid.

249
00:11:10,153 --> 00:11:12,810
- Yeah I know, you told
me a hundred times.

250
00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:14,116
- Hey, Loosh!

251
00:11:14,116 --> 00:11:15,345
Come on, we don't have time for this,

252
00:11:15,345 --> 00:11:17,838
we're getting our asses kicked!

253
00:11:17,838 --> 00:11:19,588
- [Crowd] Yeah, yeah!

254
00:11:22,528 --> 00:11:23,361
- All right, guys,

255
00:11:23,361 --> 00:11:24,880
I gotta see this idiot
two days a week at work,

256
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,350
so let's get something going right now.

257
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:27,387
Okay, Rick and John, you go long.

258
00:11:27,387 --> 00:11:28,920
Keith, you do a button hook,

259
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:30,383
you'll blow right by 'em,
they won't see you okay?

260
00:11:30,383 --> 00:11:31,535
On one, let's go.

261
00:11:31,535 --> 00:11:32,785
- [Team] Break!

262
00:11:34,021 --> 00:11:35,162
- [Man] On defense!

263
00:11:35,162 --> 00:11:37,329
- You're dead meat, Loosh!

264
00:11:40,917 --> 00:11:42,477
- Down set!

265
00:11:42,477 --> 00:11:43,310
Hike!

266
00:11:43,310 --> 00:11:46,143
(energetic music)

267
00:11:51,616 --> 00:11:52,449
- Let go!

268
00:11:55,232 --> 00:11:57,899
(pager beeping)

269
00:11:59,261 --> 00:12:00,094
- Keith!

270
00:12:01,148 --> 00:12:02,481
You're approved!

271
00:12:03,897 --> 00:12:06,167
- [Man] Where they at, Keith?

272
00:12:06,167 --> 00:12:08,680
- [Kim] It is, it's true.

273
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:10,640
- [Keith] You are the best, you know that?

274
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:11,591
- [Kim] I know.

275
00:12:11,591 --> 00:12:13,750
- [Keith] (laughing) The
best girl I ever had.

276
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:17,657
- [Keith] The only girl
you ever had. (chuckling)

277
00:12:17,657 --> 00:12:20,280
- [Keith] Can you imagine if
Mrs. Sawyer could see us now?

278
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:21,230
- Oh.

279
00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:22,540
Keith Lussier, you come over here

280
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:23,630
and sit next to Kimberly.

281
00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:25,431
She'll be a good influence on you.

282
00:12:25,431 --> 00:12:26,598
- Yeah, right.

283
00:12:27,613 --> 00:12:30,473
- Well here's to Mrs.
Sawyer, third period English.

284
00:12:32,650 --> 00:12:34,665
- Here's to Kimberly Lussier.

285

Man, you're in there deep.

This is a legitimately cute kid, man.

It's just these stupid
hormones they had me on.

340
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:57,056
- [Mom] You shouldn't be
having any reactions to those

341
00:14:57,056 --> 00:14:58,469
after all this time.

342
00:14:58,469 --> 00:15:00,220
I want you to see a doctor.

343
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:02,350

00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:03,550
I'll be right out, okay?

345
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:11,520

- Careful, careful, please.

347
00:15:13,450 --> 00:15:14,520
- Amazing.

348
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:16,630
You're actually gonna be a father.

349
00:15:16,630 --> 00:15:17,930

350
00:15:19,451 --> 00:15:23,425

- [Kim] Watch the picture, Dad.

354
00:15:31,878 --> 00:15:32,970
- [Bob] Well it was his idea.

355
00:15:32,970 --> 00:15:34,321
- [Keith] No it wasn't my idea.

356
00:15:34,321 --> 00:15:36,405
- [Kim] Please be careful.

357
00:15:36,405 --> 00:15:37,238
- Jesus.

358
00:15:37,238 --> 00:15:38,688

359
00:15:38,688 --> 00:15:39,733
Watch the picture.

360
00:15:39,733 --> 00:15:41,290
- [Bob] Oh, it was his idea.

361
00:15:41,290 --> 00:15:42,738
He wanted to put it down,

362
00:15:42,738 --> 00:15:44,513
put it together downstairs.

363
00:15:44,513 --> 00:15:45,480
- Keith?

364
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:46,957
Did any instructions come with this

365
00:15:46,957 --> 00:15:48,067
changing table?
- Kim, where are the

366
00:15:48,067 --> 00:15:49,498
instructions to the changing table?

367
00:15:49,498 --> 00:15:50,698
- They're on the hall tabletop.

368
00:15:50,698 --> 00:15:52,570
- Watch the ceiling, watch the ceiling.

369
00:15:52,570 --> 00:15:53,993
Okay, where'd you want this, honey?

370
00:15:53,993 --> 00:15:55,877
- Here by the window,
right under the window.

371
00:15:55,877 --> 00:15:57,660
- I'll move out of the way.
- So this will have to go.

372
00:15:57,660 --> 00:16:00,450
- I really think it belongs in the corner.

373
00:16:00,450 --> 00:16:02,320
Who wants the baby in the direct sun?

374
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,507
- [Keith] Ma.

375
00:16:03,507 --> 00:16:04,360
- This is the last move.

376
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:06,779
- Got it?
- Sure. (laughing)

377
00:16:06,779 --> 00:16:07,612
- Here?

378
00:16:07,612 --> 00:16:08,820
- [Kim] No, center it
to the left a little.

379
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:09,690
To the left, to the left.

380
00:16:09,690 --> 00:16:11,070
Stop, oh back a little.

381
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:12,298
Okay, down.

382
00:16:12,298 --> 00:16:13,131
Right.

383
00:16:13,131 --> 00:16:14,033
- [Keith] Yeah?

384
00:16:14,033 --> 00:16:15,320
- Yeah.
- This is great.

385
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:16,220
- You know, on second thought,

386
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:17,370
I think that I'm gonna...

387
00:16:17,370 --> 00:16:19,020
Just kidding, it's perfect, it's perfect.

388
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:21,410
- I'll go see if Rob needs anything.

389
00:16:21,410 --> 00:16:22,410
- I'll go with you.

390
00:16:22,410 --> 00:16:23,799
Anybody want anything to eat?

391
00:16:23,799 --> 00:16:27,040
- [Kim And Keith] No thanks.

392
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:27,873
- Thanks, Dad.

393
00:16:27,873 --> 00:16:29,730
- You're welcome, ow.

394
00:16:29,730 --> 00:16:32,313
(Kim laughing)

395
00:16:34,444 --> 00:16:36,401
- (sighing) I think it looks great.

396
00:16:36,401 --> 00:16:37,234
- Yup.

397
00:16:37,234 --> 00:16:38,683
Just watch out for the sunburn.

398
00:16:41,616 --> 00:16:42,520
- I mean I'm beginning to believe

399
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:43,353
this is true, you know?

400
00:16:43,353 --> 00:16:44,900
There's gonna be a baby in here.

401
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:45,985
- Yup.

402
00:16:45,985 --> 00:16:47,150
- Just wait till I get those curtains up,

403
00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:48,610
those beautiful lace curtains.

404
00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:49,780
There's gonna be enough shade.

405
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:51,164
No sunburn for baby Brittany.

406
00:16:51,164 --> 00:16:51,997
- [Keith] Yeah.

407
00:16:51,997 --> 00:16:53,600
- And Keith, I'm really glad
we went with teddy bears.

408
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:54,600
They are so cute.

409
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,526
I mean I can't believe
this mobile we found.

410
00:16:56,526 --> 00:16:57,550
Look at all the teddy bears,

411
00:16:57,550 --> 00:16:59,450
it matches the border and
the sheets that we got,

412
00:16:59,450 --> 00:17:00,283
the changing table.

413
00:17:00,283 --> 00:17:01,116
- Yeah, it's nice.

414
00:17:01,116 --> 00:17:02,720
- Hey, families!
- Hi, Jack.

415
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:03,553
- [Jack] Where's my boy?

416
00:17:03,553 --> 00:17:04,870
- [Donna] Upstairs!

417
00:17:04,870 --> 00:17:07,270
- I told you about this
the other day, remember?

418
00:17:27,227 --> 00:17:28,983
- Don't worry about it, he'll come around.

419
00:17:28,983 --> 00:17:29,860
- Yeah?

420
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:30,860
- Yeah, I'm serious.

421
00:17:32,179 --> 00:17:33,012
He's a hell of a lot better than I was

422
00:17:33,012 --> 00:17:34,240
when I was his age.

423
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,450
- Oh, I doubt that.

424
00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:36,730
- No, I'm serious.

425
00:17:36,730 --> 00:17:37,650
Donna?

426
00:17:37,650 --> 00:17:38,483
- [Donna] What?

427
00:17:38,483 --> 00:17:41,630
- Tell her what kind of
prospective young father was I?

428
00:17:41,630 --> 00:17:42,580
- [Donna] Terrible.

429
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:43,763
- There, you see?

430
00:17:46,090 --> 00:17:48,350
I was into duck hunting in those days too.

431
00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:50,220
I used to come home smelling like

432
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:52,113
wet dogs and cigars.

433
00:17:53,602 --> 00:17:56,000
And then you came along.

434
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,010
And suddenly my golf
game started slipping,

435
00:17:58,010 --> 00:17:59,360
the beer started tasting flat.

436
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:01,093
- Oh, that'll be the day, dad.

437
00:18:01,093 --> 00:18:02,283
- Hey, I'm serious.

438
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,700
You know why, because suddenly,

439
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:06,830
I had this little girl

440
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:10,873
whose face would light up
when I walked into the room.

441
00:18:12,818 --> 00:18:14,520
And now you're gonna
have a baby of your own.

442
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:15,383
Oh, baby.

443
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:22,426
(gentle music)

444
00:18:22,426 --> 00:18:24,160
Listen, don't you worry about Keith.

445
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,260
He's got a good heart.

446
00:18:27,492 --> 00:18:29,342
And when this baby gets a piece of it

447
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:31,869
he's gonna be a goner for her

448
00:18:31,869 --> 00:18:33,693
just like I am for you.

449
00:18:38,033 --> 00:18:43,033
- [Kim] Thank you, daddy.

450
00:18:48,419 --> 00:18:51,252
(clubs whooshing)

451
00:18:55,355 --> 00:18:58,938
(baby babbling and crying)

452
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:05,746
- Hey Captain, we gonna do this?

453
00:19:05,746 --> 00:19:06,579
Hmm, good?

454
00:19:09,788 --> 00:19:11,788
This one's for you, kid.

455
00:19:15,490 --> 00:19:16,487
Oh yeah!

456
00:19:16,487 --> 00:19:18,520
- Not bad, Jacko, not bad.

457
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:22,643
Okay I'm off a bit.
(pager beeping)

458
00:19:24,667 --> 00:19:25,500
Be right back.

459
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:26,867
- [Jack] Aw, man.

460
00:19:26,867 --> 00:19:29,534
(phone ringing)

461
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:32,850
- This is Keith.

462
00:19:32,850 --> 00:19:33,803
Hi Bob, what's up?

463
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:37,643
The hospital, what happened?

464
00:19:38,969 --> 00:19:40,857
(tense music)

465
00:19:40,857 --> 00:19:42,740
Uh huh, well what did the doctors say?

466
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:44,140
I mean what are they saying?

467
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:48,330
Yeah, right away, of course.

468
00:19:48,330 --> 00:19:49,327
I'm on my way.

469
00:19:51,879 --> 00:19:54,379
(car revving)

470
00:19:59,304 --> 00:20:00,172
All right, thanks a lot.

471
00:20:00,172 --> 00:20:01,005
- [Jack] You sure you don't want me

472
00:20:01,005 --> 00:20:01,838
to go in with you?

473
00:20:01,838 --> 00:20:02,942
- [Keith] No, no, I'm fine, thanks.

474
00:20:02,942 --> 00:20:05,942
- [Jack] All right, call me at home!

475
00:20:18,070 --> 00:20:20,906
(tense music)

476
00:20:20,906 --> 00:20:22,984
- [Announcer] Dr. Park to the ICU.

477
00:20:22,984 --> 00:20:24,151
Dr. Park, ICU.

478
00:20:27,663 --> 00:20:32,663
(people chattering)
(equipment beeping)

479
00:20:51,498 --> 00:20:52,882
- Hi, baby.

480
00:20:52,882 --> 00:20:54,301
- Hi.

481
00:20:54,301 --> 00:20:55,821
- How you doing, sweety?

482
00:20:55,821 --> 00:20:57,297
- I'm not really sure yet.

483
00:20:59,748 --> 00:21:00,581
Is it cancer?

484
00:21:01,602 --> 00:21:03,990
- The doctor said so.

485
00:21:03,990 --> 00:21:04,823
- How bad is it?

486
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:08,193
- Well they're not really sure.

487
00:21:08,193 --> 00:21:10,260
They want to operate right away.

488
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:12,160
Do a complete hysterectomy.

489
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:14,870
- You're going to be all right.

490
00:21:14,870 --> 00:21:17,003
We'll be with you every step of the way.

491
00:21:21,982 --> 00:21:24,083
- Guess we're not going to
the movies tonight, huh dad?

492
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:26,563
- Well, not tonight.

493
00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:29,703
- Wow, a hysterectomy.

494
00:21:30,685 --> 00:21:31,763
Unbelievable.

495
00:21:35,230 --> 00:21:37,950
Oh well, it was lousy equipment anyway.

496
00:21:37,950 --> 00:21:39,850
Thank god for adoption huh?

497
00:21:43,642 --> 00:21:45,235
What?

498
00:21:45,235 --> 00:21:46,574
- Nothing.

499
00:21:46,574 --> 00:21:47,572
- Is there something wrong?

500
00:21:47,572 --> 00:21:49,155
Is there a problem?

501
00:21:50,650 --> 00:21:53,370
- No, the doctor just thinks
maybe we ought to just,

502
00:21:54,711 --> 00:21:55,593
put it on hold for a minute,

503
00:21:55,593 --> 00:21:58,878
just till we see what
we're dealing with here.

504
00:21:58,878 --> 00:22:00,670
- No, but that means.

505
00:22:00,670 --> 00:22:02,270
What, no Keith we can't,

506
00:22:02,270 --> 00:22:03,111
we could lose Brittany.

507
00:22:03,111 --> 00:22:03,944
- [Keith] I know.

508
00:22:03,944 --> 00:22:05,340
- I mean she's practically here!

509
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:06,173
- I know honey,

510
00:22:06,173 --> 00:22:07,756
let's just see what we're dealing with.

511
00:22:07,756 --> 00:22:11,589
Okay, I'm sure you'll
be up on your feet soon.

512
00:22:20,735 --> 00:22:23,902
(gentle somber music)

513
00:22:40,353 --> 00:22:42,017
Hi, Edna.

514
00:22:42,017 --> 00:22:43,302
It's Keith Lussier.

515
00:22:43,302 --> 00:22:44,663
- Hi, Keith.

516
00:22:44,663 --> 00:22:46,129
Look, I'm just on my way up

517
00:22:46,129 --> 00:22:47,670
but tell Kim that we still don't know

518
00:22:47,670 --> 00:22:49,640
when the baby's due in.

519
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:50,790
There's nothing wrong, though.

520
00:22:50,790 --> 00:22:53,770
It's just the same old
bureaucratic runaround.

521
00:22:53,770 --> 00:22:56,190
- No, no, I'm not really
calling about that.

522
00:22:56,190 --> 00:22:57,337
It's about Kim.

523
00:22:58,644 --> 00:22:59,811
- [Edna] Yeah?

524
00:23:03,288 --> 00:23:06,242
- Boy, it's hard to just
come right out and say.

525
00:23:06,242 --> 00:23:07,075
It turns out well,

526
00:23:07,075 --> 00:23:08,482
it turns out that she has cancer.

527
00:23:08,482 --> 00:23:09,315
- Oh no.

528
00:23:09,315 --> 00:23:10,240
Oh my god, no.
- Yeah, yeah.

529
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:12,140
We're all kind of in shock here.

530
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:13,340
We still don't know how bad it is yet,

531
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:15,660
but listen, what I was wondering,

532
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:17,697
was well, you know, if
it's not too serious

533
00:23:17,697 --> 00:23:20,560
and Kim gets back on her
feet fairly soon, see?

534
00:23:22,050 --> 00:23:23,617
And she's really got
her heart set on this.

535
00:23:23,617 --> 00:23:25,877
And I mean, we named her
Brittany and everything.

536
00:23:25,877 --> 00:23:27,590
Now I know we're gonna have

537
00:23:27,590 --> 00:23:29,000
to postpone this for a little while

538
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,790
but what I was wondering is if maybe

539
00:23:33,110 --> 00:23:35,740
she could just stay in Korea
for a little while longer,

540
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:37,780
just till we see what we're up against.

541
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:39,986
- Keith, we can't do that.

542
00:23:39,986 --> 00:23:42,520
But there are any number
of other children.

543
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:43,720
- I know, I know.

544
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:45,760
But see, after getting the
picture and everything,

545
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:47,463
I got it right here.

546
00:23:47,463 --> 00:23:49,660
Kim made copies of it for
all our friends and stuff.

547
00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:50,960
It's like she's already ours.

548
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:54,230
And now, after this, it's
gonna really devastate her

549
00:23:54,230 --> 00:23:55,467
to have to give her up.

550
00:23:56,450 --> 00:23:57,950
- [Edna] I'm really sorry but,

551
00:23:59,090 --> 00:24:00,410
there's nothing we can do.

552
00:24:00,410 --> 00:24:01,410
This is a baby girl,

553
00:24:01,410 --> 00:24:03,483
we can't just put her back on the shelf.

554
00:24:03,483 --> 00:24:05,310
- I know, I know.

555
00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:06,550
- [Edna] But you call me just as soon

556
00:24:06,550 --> 00:24:08,847
as Kim's out of the woods, okay?

557
00:24:08,847 --> 00:24:09,940
Okay, Keith?

558
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:10,773
- Yeah.

559
00:24:10,773 --> 00:24:11,847
Yeah, I will.

560
00:24:11,847 --> 00:24:14,590
- [Edna] And I'm really sorry about this.

561
00:24:14,590 --> 00:24:16,820
Tell Kim I'll be praying for her.

562
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:19,960
And Keith, you take care
of yourself too, okay?

563
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:20,793
- Okay.

564
00:24:20,793 --> 00:24:22,400
- [Edna] We'll find you
a wonderful child, Keith,

565
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:23,233
I promise you.

566
00:24:26,049 --> 00:24:27,100
Okay.

567
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:27,963
- Okay, thanks.

568
00:24:30,461 --> 00:24:31,294
Bye.

569
00:24:37,399 --> 00:24:39,899
(light music)

570
00:24:57,234 --> 00:25:02,234
Nice and slow.

571
00:25:04,540 --> 00:25:05,663
- Welcome home, dear.

572
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:09,650
- It'll just be a minute.

573
00:25:09,650 --> 00:25:10,590
We'll be right down.

574
00:25:12,579 --> 00:25:13,807
I don't know how we'll
get rid of everybody.

575
00:25:13,807 --> 00:25:14,640
I don't know what she was thinking.

576
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:15,662
- No, no it's fine, it's fine.

577
00:25:15,662 --> 00:25:18,826
I just need a minute to
get my breath is all.

578
00:25:18,826 --> 00:25:20,911
All right, you go tell the others.

579
00:25:20,911 --> 00:25:22,578
I'll be right there.

580
00:25:46,771 --> 00:25:49,354
(gentle music)

581
00:26:04,651 --> 00:26:06,530
(guests chattering)

582
00:26:06,530 --> 00:26:08,090
- Look out, look out, these are hot.

583
00:26:08,090 --> 00:26:09,490
Look out.
- Oh, here we go.

584
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:11,996
Wait, let me get another one.

585
00:26:11,996 --> 00:26:13,175
- [Marge] Put something
under here, will you?

586
00:26:13,175 --> 00:26:15,151
- Sorry I had to take all these.

587
00:26:15,151 --> 00:26:17,008
- [Marge] There you go.

588
00:26:17,008 --> 00:26:20,008
(guests chattering)

589
00:26:26,223 --> 00:26:27,226
- You okay?
- Ah!

590
00:26:27,226 --> 00:26:28,059
Here she is.
- I'm fine.

591
00:26:28,059 --> 00:26:29,073
I'm great.

592
00:26:29,073 --> 00:26:30,453
I have an announcement to make.

593
00:26:30,453 --> 00:26:32,303
I just talked to Edna and guess what?

594
00:26:33,173 --> 00:26:34,613
We're getting Brittany after all.

595
00:26:35,690 --> 00:26:37,570
- [Keith] What, what?

596
00:26:37,570 --> 00:26:38,403
- Yeah.

597
00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:41,703
- Oh, Kim.

598
00:26:43,580 --> 00:26:45,513
That's wonderful!

599
00:26:46,417 --> 00:26:48,981
- [Kim] Yeah, I thought so.

600
00:26:48,981 --> 00:26:50,520
- But how?

601
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:51,430
Now what happened?

602
00:26:51,430 --> 00:26:52,380
- Did you tell her what the doctor said?

603
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:54,140
- Yes, I told her exactly what he said,

604
00:26:54,140 --> 00:26:55,610
that they got 99% of the cancer

605
00:26:55,610 --> 00:26:57,420
and they're confident that
I'll make a full recovery.

606
00:26:57,420 --> 00:26:58,332
So.

607
00:26:58,332 --> 00:26:59,640
There you go.
- Wow!

608
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:00,856
- [Marge] Grandbaby!

609
00:27:00,856 --> 00:27:03,660
- We are!
- I'm so happy.

610
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:04,493
- There you go.

611
00:27:04,493 --> 00:27:05,460
- [Donna] Wonderful.

612
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:07,810
- Let's leave it.

613
00:27:11,090 --> 00:27:12,792
- Oh Keith, this is crazy.

614
00:27:12,792 --> 00:27:13,625
- What?

615
00:27:13,625 --> 00:27:15,170
- You heard what the doctor said.

616
00:27:15,170 --> 00:27:17,158
This is a very aggressive kind of cancer

617
00:27:17,158 --> 00:27:18,630
and they didn't even get all of it.

618
00:27:18,630 --> 00:27:20,860
I mean who's gonna look
after this little baby

619
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:22,110
when she's having chemotherapy?

620
00:27:22,110 --> 00:27:22,943
- Everybody's gonna help.

621
00:27:22,943 --> 00:27:24,655
- Her family knew about his, didn't they?

622
00:27:24,655 --> 00:27:26,000
- No.

623
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,120
- Nobody even thought
to talk to us about it.

624
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:28,953
- Marge!

625
00:27:28,953 --> 00:27:29,786
- Look.

626
00:27:29,786 --> 00:27:31,537
This is something that's
going to affect all of us.

627
00:27:31,537 --> 00:27:34,356
Now Kim is in for a long, hard fight.

628
00:27:34,356 --> 00:27:35,550
I don't think this is any time for them

629
00:27:35,550 --> 00:27:37,450
to bring a little baby into the house.

630
00:27:38,410 --> 00:27:39,890
Did you talk to Dr. Sorram about it?

631
00:27:39,890 --> 00:27:41,170
- No, but he's very optimistic.

632
00:27:41,170 --> 00:27:43,160
You heard him, she's young, she's strong.

633
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:43,993
- And she still has cancer.

634
00:27:43,993 --> 00:27:46,280
- And they got 99% of it, mom.

635
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:47,753
- Meaning they didn't get all of it.

636
00:27:47,753 --> 00:27:49,210
Look Keith, listen to me.

637
00:27:49,210 --> 00:27:50,550
I'm not saying that Kim isn't gonna come

638
00:27:50,550 --> 00:27:52,070
through this just fine.

639
00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:54,680
But with chemotherapy and everything,

640
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:55,820
Keith, she's gonna get a lot worse

641
00:27:55,820 --> 00:27:57,060
before she gets better.

642
00:27:57,060 --> 00:27:59,240
And with a little baby to raise,

643
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:00,490
this is not fair to the child, Keith.

644
00:28:00,490 --> 00:28:01,323
- What am I supposed to do,

645
00:28:01,323 --> 00:28:02,790
go in there and tell
her she can't have it?

646
00:28:02,790 --> 00:28:04,940
- Are you ready to start raising a baby?

647
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:07,150
Now I want you to think about that, Keith.

648
00:28:07,150 --> 00:28:09,470
And then you go and talk to Kim.

649
00:28:09,470 --> 00:28:10,670
- Marge, let's go.

650
00:28:10,670 --> 00:28:13,751
Keith.

651
00:28:13,751 --> 00:28:16,918
(somber guitar music)

652
00:28:25,476 --> 00:28:27,976
(light music)

653
00:28:34,538 --> 00:28:36,173
- Marge gave you an earful, huh?

654
00:28:37,153 --> 00:28:37,986
- Well.

655
00:28:39,030 --> 00:28:40,480
She's just concerned, is all.

656
00:28:43,643 --> 00:28:44,643
- Come here.

657
00:28:46,981 --> 00:28:47,814
Come here.

658
00:28:53,555 --> 00:28:55,460
I'm gonna promise you something, okay?

659
00:28:55,460 --> 00:28:56,800
- Yeah?

660
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:59,691
- I promise that this baby
is gonna be the best thing

661
00:28:59,691 --> 00:29:01,654
that ever happened to us.

662
00:29:01,654 --> 00:29:02,505
Okay?

663
00:29:02,505 --> 00:29:03,338
- Okay.

664
00:29:03,338 --> 00:29:04,338
- It's true.

665
00:29:05,345 --> 00:29:09,983
And you're gonna be the
greatest, greatest dad.

666
00:29:09,983 --> 00:29:11,182
- Can I still play a little golf?

667
00:29:11,182 --> 00:29:13,293
- Absolutely not.

668
00:29:13,293 --> 00:29:15,876
(Kim laughing)

669
00:29:33,317 --> 00:29:35,984
(phone ringing)

670
00:29:38,677 --> 00:29:40,587
- [Donna] Hello?

671
00:29:40,587 --> 00:29:42,504
No, this is her mother.

672
00:29:43,550 --> 00:29:45,330
Oh hi, Edna.

673
00:29:45,330 --> 00:29:46,163
Any news?

674
00:29:47,811 --> 00:29:50,478
(truck revving)

675
00:29:54,727 --> 00:29:57,080
I shouldn't have let Bob do the shopping!

676
00:29:57,080 --> 00:30:00,002
How are we ever gonna find what we need?

677
00:30:00,002 --> 00:30:02,575
Now we need formula, we need wet wipes.

678
00:30:02,575 --> 00:30:03,824
We need...

679
00:30:03,824 --> 00:30:05,010
- All right just give me a second.

680
00:30:05,010 --> 00:30:05,843
I want to get a shot.

681
00:30:05,843 --> 00:30:06,959
- How many kids are we getting?

682
00:30:06,959 --> 00:30:08,917
It's like Desert Storm in here.

683
00:30:08,917 --> 00:30:10,700
- Mom, don't forget Little Piggy.

684
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:12,240
I'm gonna wait up for you guys, okay?

685
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:13,690
And call me as soon as
you get to the airport.

686
00:30:13,690 --> 00:30:15,120
- Honey, we're not even
gonna be back till like

687
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:15,988
three in the morning.
- I don't care.

688
00:30:15,988 --> 00:30:17,366
I'm gonna wait, okay?
- Whoa, whoa.

689
00:30:17,366 --> 00:30:20,266
Hold it now, I wanna get a
before picture here, all right?

690
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:22,033
Everybody.

691
00:30:22,033 --> 00:30:22,910
(camera clicking)

692
00:30:22,910 --> 00:30:23,890
Haha, great!

693
00:30:23,890 --> 00:30:24,723
- Good bye.

694
00:30:24,723 --> 00:30:25,556
- Hurry home, Mr. Dad.

695
00:30:25,556 --> 00:30:26,389
- Good bye.

696
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:29,234
See you.
- Drive carefully, huh?

697
00:30:29,234 --> 00:30:30,266
Let me get a shot.

698
00:30:30,266 --> 00:30:31,099
- Dad, stop it.

699
00:30:31,099 --> 00:30:33,807
(camera clicking)

700
00:30:33,807 --> 00:30:36,357
(clock ticking)

701
00:30:36,357 --> 00:30:38,857
(Bob snoring)

702
00:30:46,156 --> 00:30:47,491
- Okay, here.

703
00:30:47,491 --> 00:30:48,885
(keys clinking)

704
00:30:48,885 --> 00:30:50,468
Watch it, watch it.

705
00:30:54,983 --> 00:30:55,816
Okay.

706
00:30:55,816 --> 00:30:56,649
Come on.

707
00:31:04,761 --> 00:31:05,594
Honey?

708
00:31:07,643 --> 00:31:08,476
Honey?

709
00:31:09,677 --> 00:31:11,094
Guess who's here?

710
00:31:14,776 --> 00:31:17,359
(gentle music)

711
00:31:20,438 --> 00:31:22,179
- Hi there.

712
00:31:22,179 --> 00:31:23,012
Hi.

713
00:31:24,859 --> 00:31:26,159
So pretty.

714
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:27,373
Look at you.

715
00:31:27,373 --> 00:31:28,206
Daddy, look.

716
00:31:28,206 --> 00:31:30,044
- I wanna see this kid.

717
00:31:30,044 --> 00:31:31,791
Oh, baby I'm so happy for you.

718
00:31:31,791 --> 00:31:34,080
Look at that hair on this kid!

719
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:36,304
I mean, kinda she takes
after her old man huh?

720
00:31:36,304 --> 00:31:37,951
- Yeah.

721
00:31:37,951 --> 00:31:38,948
- Take a picture, daddy.

722
00:31:38,948 --> 00:31:39,967
Take a picture.
- Yeah yeah yeah.

723
00:31:39,967 --> 00:31:41,970
- Look at you, baby girl.

724
00:31:41,970 --> 00:31:43,200
Keith, look.

725
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:45,010
- Yeah, she's beautiful.

726
00:31:45,010 --> 00:31:46,896
- Look at you sweet girl.
- Okay now.

727
00:31:46,896 --> 00:31:48,096
- Here, Keith.

728
00:31:48,096 --> 00:31:49,280
You come take her, okay?

729
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:50,257
- Oh, no, it's okay.
- Here we go, come on.

730
00:31:50,257 --> 00:31:51,943
Keith, you get in.
- It'll be okay.

731
00:31:51,943 --> 00:31:53,300
Really, come sit.

732
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:55,096
It's really okay.

733
00:31:55,096 --> 00:31:57,470
Just be careful of her head.

734
00:31:57,470 --> 00:31:58,353
Support it.

735
00:32:00,101 --> 00:32:01,101
There we go.

736
00:32:03,035 --> 00:32:04,769
- Hi.
- What do you think, mom?

737
00:32:04,769 --> 00:32:06,437
- Smile.
- She's wonderful.

738
00:32:06,437 --> 00:32:09,608
(camera clicking)

739
00:32:09,608 --> 00:32:10,858
- Keith, smile.

740
00:32:12,567 --> 00:32:13,400
Smile.

741
00:32:14,946 --> 00:32:17,529
(gentle music)

742
00:32:23,359 --> 00:32:25,109
That's it, that's it.

743
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:36,750
- [Keith] Kim, it's a trap.

744
00:32:36,750 --> 00:32:38,170
They're trying to trick
us, I'm telling you.

745
00:32:38,170 --> 00:32:40,390
- [Kim] Keith, will you relax?

746
00:32:40,390 --> 00:32:41,223
- See, this is what they do.

747
00:32:41,223 --> 00:32:42,960
They tell you at three o'clock

748
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:44,396
just to get you relaxed
and they come at two

749
00:32:44,396 --> 00:32:45,229
just to get you off guard.

750
00:32:45,229 --> 00:32:47,422
- She had a cancellation, sweetheart.

751
00:32:47,422 --> 00:32:48,780
- Huh?

752
00:32:48,780 --> 00:32:50,690
- She had a cancellation, honey.

753
00:32:50,690 --> 00:32:51,571
- Yeah, right.

754
00:32:51,571 --> 00:32:52,404
- Hello, pretty girl.

755
00:32:52,404 --> 00:32:54,600
There we go, all this free stuff.

756
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:57,310
Ah, pretty lady, little baby girl.

757
00:33:00,770 --> 00:33:02,486
Keith, could you come
here for a minute please?

758
00:33:02,486 --> 00:33:03,319
- What?

759
00:33:06,330 --> 00:33:08,140
- Could you finish dressing her, please?

760
00:33:08,140 --> 00:33:09,178
- [Keith] Yeah, are you okay?

761
00:33:09,178 --> 00:33:10,011
- Yeah, I'm fine.

762
00:33:10,011 --> 00:33:10,844
Just, I'll be right back.

763
00:33:10,844 --> 00:33:11,719
Here's her dress.

764
00:33:11,719 --> 00:33:13,302
Excuse me, bye bye.

765
00:33:15,249 --> 00:33:16,416
- Hello, baby.

766
00:33:17,572 --> 00:33:18,405
Okay.

767
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:37,253
Oh boy.

768
00:33:42,060 --> 00:33:42,893
Honey?

769
00:33:43,733 --> 00:33:45,138
She's here!

770
00:33:45,138 --> 00:33:45,971
Kim?

771
00:33:49,723 --> 00:33:51,640
Okay, give me your arm.

772
00:33:55,893 --> 00:33:58,560
(door knocking)

773
00:34:06,933 --> 00:34:07,766
Hi.

774
00:34:11,177 --> 00:34:12,094
Come on in.

775
00:34:14,707 --> 00:34:17,375
(baby crying)

776
00:34:17,375 --> 00:34:19,566
- Oh, sweety, it's okay.

777
00:34:19,566 --> 00:34:21,316
It's okay, it's okay.

778
00:34:25,217 --> 00:34:26,050
It's okay.

779
00:34:26,922 --> 00:34:27,755
It's okay.

780
00:34:28,794 --> 00:34:29,958
- Maybe she's hungry.

781
00:34:29,958 --> 00:34:31,886
- No, no, no, I just fed her.

782
00:34:31,886 --> 00:34:33,303
It's okay.
- Yeah.

783
00:34:34,331 --> 00:34:36,213
How's she doing then?

784
00:34:36,213 --> 00:34:38,963
- Hey, baby, you should try then.

785
00:34:40,030 --> 00:34:41,608
- Oh, come here, baby girl.

786
00:34:41,608 --> 00:34:42,608
Oh, oh baby!

787
00:34:44,588 --> 00:34:45,421
Oh!

788
00:34:46,307 --> 00:34:47,653
(baby shrieking)

789
00:34:47,653 --> 00:34:48,650
- [Kim] Maybe you should try

790
00:34:48,650 --> 00:34:50,598
the Sunday Speedway thing, you know?

791
00:34:50,598 --> 00:34:51,964
- Huh?
- It's really fun.

792
00:34:51,964 --> 00:34:52,859
- [Keith] Are you sure?

793
00:34:52,859 --> 00:34:55,109
- [Kim] Yes, please, honey.

794
00:34:57,964 --> 00:34:59,300
- Okay.

795
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:02,150
Vroom, Sunday ladies and gentlemen.

796
00:35:02,150 --> 00:35:03,655
Heat it up to the dragsters

797
00:35:03,655 --> 00:35:06,664
burning off the line, Brittany Lussier!

798
00:35:06,664 --> 00:35:09,247
(hectic music)

799
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:15,507
(baby giggling)

800
00:35:21,304 --> 00:35:23,566
(tires screeching)

801
00:35:23,566 --> 00:35:24,439
Turn, turn!

802
00:35:24,439 --> 00:35:26,189
Turn four, turn four!

803
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:28,373
Reverse!

804
00:35:34,556 --> 00:35:37,223
(Edna laughing)

805
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:42,596
Good as new.
- Here's my girl.

806
00:35:42,596 --> 00:35:45,457
Oh, I think Daddy and
Brittany came in first place.

807
00:35:45,457 --> 00:35:47,965
Yes it is, yes it is.

808
00:35:47,965 --> 00:35:49,318
What a good girl.

809
00:35:49,318 --> 00:35:51,401
Yes, who's a pretty girl?

810
00:35:54,460 --> 00:35:56,200
- Believe me, I see a
lot of adoptive fathers

811
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:58,556
who don't know how to get
down to a child's level.

812
00:35:58,556 --> 00:36:00,806
- Well that's never been
a problem for Keith.

813
00:36:03,570 --> 00:36:06,310
- Because the social
worker was a little worried

814
00:36:06,310 --> 00:36:07,410
when you weren't there at the airport.

815
00:36:07,410 --> 00:36:09,290
It's never happened before.

816
00:36:09,290 --> 00:36:10,760
It's the first time an adoptive mother

817
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:12,560
wasn't there for her baby's arrival.

818
00:36:13,950 --> 00:36:15,920
- Well you told me about
another woman who had cancer.

819
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:18,520
She must have been flat
on her back for a while.

820
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:19,993
- Yes she was, for a while.

821
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:22,073
So long.

822
00:36:23,860 --> 00:36:25,844
- Oh, don't worry about that, honey.

823
00:36:25,844 --> 00:36:29,127
I mean, who knows what
this other woman had?

824
00:36:29,127 --> 00:36:31,043
- Edna told me she had uterine cancer.

825
00:36:31,043 --> 00:36:32,683
- Well yeah well, so,

826
00:36:34,490 --> 00:36:36,607
maybe they caught it a little sooner.

827
00:36:38,710 --> 00:36:39,890
What's the matter?

828
00:36:39,890 --> 00:36:42,350
I thought we did really great today.

829
00:36:42,350 --> 00:36:43,803
- You had me scared
there for a while though.

830
00:36:43,803 --> 00:36:45,550
- I know, I almost gave Britt whiplash

831
00:36:45,550 --> 00:36:46,750
going through turn four.

832
00:36:49,150 --> 00:36:51,794
Oh, what is it, hmm, hmm?

833
00:36:51,794 --> 00:36:54,623
- Keith, would you quit?

834
00:36:54,623 --> 00:36:55,810
I just, it's nothing,

835
00:36:55,810 --> 00:36:57,280
I'm sure, it's just that I...

836
00:36:58,180 --> 00:37:00,903
Today, I think I felt a lump, another.

837
00:37:02,010 --> 00:37:02,860
Do you feel that?

838
00:37:04,348 --> 00:37:05,181
- Right there?

839
00:37:05,181 --> 00:37:06,383
- Yeah.

840
00:37:06,383 --> 00:37:08,464
- It's probably just a
reaction to the chemo.

841
00:37:08,464 --> 00:37:11,280
- Honey, chemo's supposed
to shrink tumors, you know?

842
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:14,641
- No baby, I don't think that's a tumor.

843
00:37:14,641 --> 00:37:16,423
(somber music)

844
00:37:16,423 --> 00:37:18,790
Look, we're gonna see
the doctor on Thursday.

845
00:37:18,790 --> 00:37:21,294
We'll ask him about it
then, but don't worry.

846
00:37:21,294 --> 00:37:22,127
- Yeah.

847
00:38:00,583 --> 00:38:03,830
- Okay now, as you can see right here,

848
00:38:03,830 --> 00:38:05,860
this dark spot.

849
00:38:05,860 --> 00:38:08,192
This is where the tumor's grown back.

850
00:38:08,192 --> 00:38:11,010
And we've also got one here.

851
00:38:11,010 --> 00:38:13,790
Now, I want to remind you
again that just because

852
00:38:13,790 --> 00:38:16,090
this particular kind of
chemo wasn't successful,

853
00:38:16,090 --> 00:38:18,090
doesn't mean that another kind won't be.

854
00:38:19,510 --> 00:38:20,660
- Okay, so what's next?

855
00:38:21,510 --> 00:38:23,530
- Well, I'm afraid we're
gonna have to operate again

856
00:38:23,530 --> 00:38:24,363
as soon as possible.
- Oh god.

857
00:38:24,363 --> 00:38:26,440
- [Doctor] In fact, I'm
already getting recommendations

858
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:27,840
from some of the best oncologists.

859
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:29,803
Literally, the best in the world.

860
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:33,289
- [Donna] Oh, she can't go

861
00:38:33,289 --> 00:38:36,365
through with that.
(Brittany crying)

862
00:38:36,365 --> 00:38:37,198
She can't.

863
00:38:37,198 --> 00:38:38,974
- [Bob] Well she's gonna
have to go through it.

864
00:38:38,974 --> 00:38:41,348
- [Donna] She can't.

865
00:38:41,348 --> 00:38:42,893
- [Bob] Come on now, come on.

866
00:38:42,893 --> 00:38:43,981
You know it's the best thing.

867
00:38:43,981 --> 00:38:46,048
The doctor says that we've got the best

868
00:38:46,048 --> 00:38:48,938
of the best doctors coming in, right?

869
00:38:48,938 --> 00:38:53,093
- [Donna] She can't go through this again.

870
00:38:53,093 --> 00:38:54,488
She can't.

871
00:38:54,488 --> 00:38:57,738
- [Bob] She's gonna have to go through.

872
00:39:00,510 --> 00:39:04,150
(thunder rumbling)
(somber music)

873
00:39:04,150 --> 00:39:05,650
- It's rain, yeah.

874
00:39:11,377 --> 00:39:13,933
Your mommy's sick, you know that, baby?

875
00:39:15,419 --> 00:39:16,919
Your mommy's sick.

876
00:39:21,710 --> 00:39:23,360
- So you pinch the skin,

877
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:25,730
hold the needle at a 45 degree angle,

878
00:39:25,730 --> 00:39:28,763
press in smoothly, depress the plunger,

879
00:39:29,620 --> 00:39:31,070
pull it out.

880
00:39:31,070 --> 00:39:32,730
It's that easy.

881
00:39:32,730 --> 00:39:33,594
- Now can I give her one if she starts

882
00:39:33,594 --> 00:39:35,298
being a pain in the ass?

883
00:39:35,298 --> 00:39:37,197
(nurse chuckling)

884
00:39:37,197 --> 00:39:39,697
(light music)

885
00:39:43,410 --> 00:39:44,472
- Oh, it's okay.

886
00:39:44,472 --> 00:39:46,552
Oh, daddy will be just a sec.

887
00:39:46,552 --> 00:39:48,053
It's okay.

888
00:39:48,053 --> 00:39:50,538
- Oh, what's the matter, Brittany?

889
00:39:50,538 --> 00:39:51,371
Oh!

890
00:39:52,734 --> 00:39:55,567
(Brittany crying)

891
00:40:02,939 --> 00:40:03,772
Okay.

892
00:41:20,003 --> 00:41:23,086
- (shrieking) Daddy.

893
00:41:25,037 --> 00:41:27,466
(Brittany giggling)

894
00:41:27,466 --> 00:41:28,299
Dada?

895
00:41:36,106 --> 00:41:39,106
(Brittany giggling)

896
00:41:58,595 --> 00:42:03,468
(Brittany shrieking and laughing)

897
00:42:03,468 --> 00:42:05,551
- [Keith] Snowball, yeah?

898
00:42:06,810 --> 00:42:07,643
Ow!

899
00:42:09,653 --> 00:42:12,653
(Brittany laughing)

900
00:42:18,897 --> 00:42:21,470
- And the baby bear looked around the room

901
00:42:21,470 --> 00:42:22,740
and saw the three chairs.

902
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:24,549
And then Papa Bear says,

903
00:42:24,549 --> 00:42:27,037
yeah, that's the Papa Bear.

904
00:42:27,037 --> 00:42:30,147
And the Papa Bear said
in his great big voice,

905
00:42:30,147 --> 00:42:33,029
"Somebody's been sitting in my chair."

906
00:42:33,029 --> 00:42:34,387
And then the Mama Bear looked at her chair

907
00:42:34,387 --> 00:42:36,317
and she said in a medium sized voice,

908
00:42:36,317 --> 00:42:38,630
"Someone's been sitting
in my chair as well."

909
00:42:38,630 --> 00:42:40,130
And then Baby Bear,

910
00:42:40,130 --> 00:42:41,600
yeah, that's the one like you.

911
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:44,747
Baby Bear said in this
really small little voice,

912
00:42:44,747 --> 00:42:46,650
"Someone's been sitting in my chair too

913
00:42:46,650 --> 00:42:48,500
and it's broke all to piece!

914
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:50,293
Oh man, it's terrible!"

915
00:42:50,293 --> 00:42:51,126
(gentle music)

916
00:42:51,126 --> 00:42:52,590
No that's not for baby standing on.

917
00:42:52,590 --> 00:42:54,173
Just turn the page.

918
00:42:55,703 --> 00:42:57,389
Oh, that's Mama Bear telling Baby Bear

919
00:42:57,389 --> 00:42:59,657
be quiet since Daddy Bear
was upstairs, you see that?

920
00:42:59,657 --> 00:43:01,780
And then the three bears thought

921
00:43:01,780 --> 00:43:02,830
they'd better search the house

922
00:43:02,830 --> 00:43:03,953
so they quickly went upstairs!

923
00:43:03,953 --> 00:43:05,330
See, see they're going to the stairs.

924
00:43:05,330 --> 00:43:07,859
And then Papa Bear, one look at the bed

925
00:43:07,859 --> 00:43:09,207
and he said in a great big voice,

926
00:43:09,207 --> 00:43:10,677
"Somebody's been sleeping in my bed!"

927
00:43:12,201 --> 00:43:13,966
Let's turn the page.

928
00:43:13,966 --> 00:43:15,972
Mama bear looked at her bed

929
00:43:15,972 --> 00:43:17,738
and she said in a medium sized voice

930
00:43:17,738 --> 00:43:21,488
"Somebody's been sleeping
in my bed as well."

931
00:43:31,482 --> 00:43:32,899
- What day is it?

932
00:43:34,256 --> 00:43:35,423
- It's Friday.

933
00:43:37,283 --> 00:43:38,783
- What's the date?

934
00:43:40,047 --> 00:43:42,214
- It's March the 6th, why?

935
00:43:43,856 --> 00:43:44,689
Hmm?

936
00:43:52,403 --> 00:43:54,736
- I love you so much, daddy.

937
00:44:00,017 --> 00:44:02,517
(Bob sighing)

938
00:44:05,969 --> 00:44:06,802
Daddy.

939
00:44:08,313 --> 00:44:09,146
- What?

940
00:44:10,397 --> 00:44:12,870
- I'm pretty much through fighting this.

941
00:44:16,723 --> 00:44:19,080
I think I can let it all go now.

942
00:44:22,475 --> 00:44:23,475
- Oh, Kimmy.

943
00:44:44,855 --> 00:44:46,188
- Where's Keith?

944
00:44:47,085 --> 00:44:49,417
- He went to get the baby.

945
00:44:49,417 --> 00:44:50,250
- Oh, no.

946
00:44:57,681 --> 00:44:59,177
- [Marge] Where's Brittany?

947
00:44:59,177 --> 00:45:01,094
- She's with Aunt Tess.

948
00:45:03,007 --> 00:45:04,379
How's she doing?

949
00:45:04,379 --> 00:45:06,296
- She wants to see you.

950
00:45:13,487 --> 00:45:14,404
- Hi, baby.

951
00:45:16,289 --> 00:45:17,203
(gentle music)

952
00:45:17,203 --> 00:45:18,708
I was gonna bring her, but...

953
00:45:18,708 --> 00:45:19,708
- It's okay.

954
00:45:20,661 --> 00:45:21,494
- [Keith] I just thought-

955
00:45:21,494 --> 00:45:22,744
- You're right.

956
00:45:29,162 --> 00:45:31,245
You're a good dad, Keith.

957
00:45:34,851 --> 00:45:36,351
You've done great.

958
00:45:39,676 --> 00:45:42,259
You take care of her now, okay?

959
00:45:50,098 --> 00:45:51,848
- I love you so much.

960
00:45:58,946 --> 00:45:59,946
- Don't cry.

961
00:46:01,036 --> 00:46:03,036
You stay strong for her.

962
00:46:15,318 --> 00:46:17,901
(somber music)

963
00:46:44,969 --> 00:46:47,469
(light music)

964
00:46:51,443 --> 00:46:54,110
(baby babbling)

965
00:47:03,294 --> 00:47:06,127
(mobile clacking)

966
00:47:08,090 --> 00:47:11,450
- In many ways, life
is like a river of time

967
00:47:11,450 --> 00:47:13,750
sweeping us down through the years.

968
00:47:13,750 --> 00:47:15,730
If we're lucky, we're swept along

969
00:47:15,730 --> 00:47:17,927
through the sunlight and shadows

970
00:47:17,927 --> 00:47:20,040
with someone we truly love.

971
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:22,570
So it was with Kim and Keith,

972
00:47:22,570 --> 00:47:24,210
sweethearts since high school.

973
00:47:24,210 --> 00:47:27,210
(Brittany giggling)

974
00:47:28,500 --> 00:47:32,433
Keith, spontaneous, free-spirited,

975
00:47:33,477 --> 00:47:34,940
and Kim, wise beyond her years.

976
00:47:38,413 --> 00:47:40,400
Even in her darkest moments

977
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:42,899
when the rest of us were reduced to tears,

978
00:47:42,899 --> 00:47:45,899
(Brittany babbling)

979
00:47:47,370 --> 00:47:49,194
Even in her darkest moments,

980
00:47:49,194 --> 00:47:52,110
when the rest of us were reduced to tears,

981
00:47:52,110 --> 00:47:54,020
Kim stayed strong,

982
00:47:54,020 --> 00:47:55,690
comforting us, insisting,

983
00:47:56,993 --> 00:47:58,650
(Brittany babbling)

984
00:47:58,650 --> 00:48:01,295
insisting that we stay positive,

985
00:48:01,295 --> 00:48:03,153
that we really mustn't cry for her.

986
00:48:05,480 --> 00:48:07,170
And although we all really must cry,

987
00:48:07,170 --> 00:48:09,954
sometimes it's part of
the healing process,

988
00:48:09,954 --> 00:48:11,040
I can see that little Brittany

989
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:12,823
has taken her mother's advice to heart.

990
00:48:14,621 --> 00:48:18,038
(congregation chuckling)

991
00:48:20,243 --> 00:48:22,743
(light music)

992
00:48:32,996 --> 00:48:34,665
- [Woman] Gosh, I'm so sorry.

993
00:48:34,665 --> 00:48:37,950
If there's anything we can do.

994
00:48:37,950 --> 00:48:40,862
- So we're doing fine, especially Britt.

995
00:48:40,862 --> 00:48:41,862
She's great.

996
00:48:42,700 --> 00:48:46,003
She's happy and she's
almost standing on her own.

997
00:48:46,003 --> 00:48:47,580
Listen, I just,

998
00:48:47,580 --> 00:48:49,184
I just wanted to let you know how much,

999
00:48:49,184 --> 00:48:52,360
how much Kim appreciated
everything that you did.

1000
00:48:52,360 --> 00:48:54,380
I know we got the finalization
coming up soon and everything

1001
00:48:54,380 --> 00:48:56,430
so give me a call when
you have the chance.

1002
00:48:56,430 --> 00:48:58,427
Okay, thanks, bye bye.

1003
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:00,413
Come on, babe.

1004
00:49:02,050 --> 00:49:03,400
- [Donna] So what'd she say?

1005
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:05,123
- I just left a message.

1006
00:49:06,550 --> 00:49:08,502
- Thank you for letting
us look after Brittany.

1007
00:49:08,502 --> 00:49:10,030
- Oh, it's the first time I've left her.

1008
00:49:10,030 --> 00:49:10,863
- Oh, she'll be fine.

1009
00:49:10,863 --> 00:49:12,900
Now you need some time to yourself.

1010
00:49:12,900 --> 00:49:14,090
- Okay now, there's a bottle in there

1011
00:49:14,090 --> 00:49:14,987
if she gets hungry, okay?

1012
00:49:14,987 --> 00:49:15,993
- Go, go.

1013
00:49:15,993 --> 00:49:16,826
- All right,

1014
00:49:16,826 --> 00:49:17,919
I've got my beeper, so
- Keith.

1015
00:49:17,919 --> 00:49:18,776
Relax.
- If you need me

1016
00:49:18,776 --> 00:49:19,609
I'm just a call away.

1017
00:49:19,609 --> 00:49:20,442
I'll be at my folks,
- Relax.

1018
00:49:20,442 --> 00:49:21,275
- And then down at the field.

1019
00:49:21,275 --> 00:49:22,210
My bag.
- The baby's gonna be fine.

1020
00:49:22,210 --> 00:49:23,043
Come on.

1021
00:49:25,727 --> 00:49:28,727
(Brittany babbling)

1022
00:49:50,396 --> 00:49:52,979
(gentle music)

1023
00:50:00,282 --> 00:50:01,819
(phone ringing)

1024
00:50:01,819 --> 00:50:03,223
- Bob?

1025
00:50:03,223 --> 00:50:05,056
Bob, can you get that?

1026
00:50:11,097 --> 00:50:11,930
Bob?

1027
00:50:15,668 --> 00:50:16,501
Hello?

1028
00:50:18,210 --> 00:50:19,590
No, no, I'm sorry he isn't.

1029
00:50:19,590 --> 00:50:20,940
Who shall I say is calling?

1030
00:50:22,210 --> 00:50:23,608
Oh, Edna.

1031
00:50:23,608 --> 00:50:25,398
This is Donna.

1032
00:50:25,398 --> 00:50:27,671
Sorry, Kim's mother?

1033
00:50:27,671 --> 00:50:28,504
Oh yes.

1034
00:50:29,365 --> 00:50:30,634
(breathing heavily)

1035
00:50:30,634 --> 00:50:32,717
I'll tell Keith it's you.

1036
00:50:36,954 --> 00:50:38,138
Bob?

1037
00:50:38,138 --> 00:50:39,514
Bob, come and take Brittany.

1038
00:50:39,514 --> 00:50:40,534
I need to call Keith

1039
00:50:40,534 --> 00:50:44,700
right away.
(Bob sobbing)

1040
00:50:44,700 --> 00:50:45,533
- [Robert] Your mom just thought

1041
00:50:45,533 --> 00:50:47,053
it'd make things easier on you.

1042
00:50:47,053 --> 00:50:48,717
- Right.

1043
00:50:48,717 --> 00:50:49,550
You know what I mean, right?

1044
00:50:49,550 --> 00:50:52,096
It's the only home that
Brittany's ever known.

1045
00:50:52,096 --> 00:50:53,670
I can't just move back here.

1046
00:50:53,670 --> 00:50:55,500
- She's worried about you, Keith.

1047
00:50:55,500 --> 00:50:56,920
Fair enough.

1048
00:50:56,920 --> 00:50:58,150
A thing like this can knock the pins out

1049
00:50:58,150 --> 00:50:59,420
from under anyone.

1050
00:50:59,420 --> 00:51:00,253
- Well I think I'm doing okay.

1051
00:51:00,253 --> 00:51:01,900
- Sure you are, you're doing just fine.

1052
00:51:01,900 --> 00:51:03,451
- It's not like I'm gonna
freak out or anything.

1053
00:51:03,451 --> 00:51:04,410
What's the point of that?

1054
00:51:04,410 --> 00:51:06,060
I just want to try and keep things

1055
00:51:06,060 --> 00:51:06,993
as normal as possible for Brittany.

1056
00:51:06,993 --> 00:51:09,307
It's all I care about.

1057
00:51:09,307 --> 00:51:10,494
- Do me a favor, okay?

1058
00:51:10,494 --> 00:51:11,430
- Mmm?

1059
00:51:11,430 --> 00:51:13,983
- You can let your guard down sometimes.

1060
00:51:13,983 --> 00:51:15,495
(phone ringing)

1061
00:51:15,495 --> 00:51:17,545
No good keeping it all bottled up inside.

1062
00:51:20,047 --> 00:51:21,327
- [Marge] Keith?

1063
00:51:21,327 --> 00:51:23,327
It's Donna on the phone.

1064
00:51:29,400 --> 00:51:30,500
- Hi, everything okay?

1065
00:51:32,910 --> 00:51:35,450
Oh well, that's just the
way she is sometimes.

1066
00:51:35,450 --> 00:51:36,340
Don't worry.

1067
00:51:36,340 --> 00:51:38,540
I'll call her back and
set it up for Friday.

1068
00:51:39,480 --> 00:51:41,413
Sure, sure, of course you can come.

1069
00:51:42,730 --> 00:51:43,563
No, no.

1070
00:51:43,563 --> 00:51:44,937
It's okay.
- So what did he say?

1071
00:51:44,937 --> 00:51:46,087
- Says he's doing fine.

1072
00:51:51,660 --> 00:51:52,493
- Everything okay?

1073
00:51:52,493 --> 00:51:53,430
- Yeah, fine.

1074
00:51:53,430 --> 00:51:55,113
Listen guys, I'm gonna head out.

1075
00:51:56,240 --> 00:51:57,600
- What was Donna calling about?

1076
00:51:57,600 --> 00:51:58,433
- Oh, Edna called.

1077
00:51:58,433 --> 00:52:01,650
We're gonna try and finalize
the adoption on Friday.

1078
00:52:01,650 --> 00:52:03,800
- Are the Mankowitzes going?

1079
00:52:03,800 --> 00:52:05,050
If they are, we should be going too.

1080
00:52:05,050 --> 00:52:07,007
We're your parents, after all.

1081
00:52:07,007 --> 00:52:09,118
- All right, let me call
you tomorrow, mom, okay?

1082
00:52:09,118 --> 00:52:09,951
Dad.

1083
00:52:09,951 --> 00:52:11,784
- [Robert] Bye, Keith.

1084
00:52:13,702 --> 00:52:16,202
(car revving)

1085
00:52:30,521 --> 00:52:33,688
(gentle somber music)

1086
00:53:08,440 --> 00:53:10,260
- [Marge] Anyway, you
could rent the house.

1087
00:53:10,260 --> 00:53:11,150
You don't have to sell it.

1088
00:53:11,150 --> 00:53:13,543
- Mom, I am not renting
the house, all right?

1089
00:53:15,190 --> 00:53:16,780
In the first place, I'm not
going back to work for a while.

1090
00:53:16,780 --> 00:53:18,440
And when I do, you can
come over to our house

1091
00:53:18,440 --> 00:53:21,150
and watch her there with
you know, Aunt Tess,

1092
00:53:21,150 --> 00:53:22,446
the Minks and everybody else.

1093
00:53:22,446 --> 00:53:25,330
- (chuckling) What are all gonna have

1094
00:53:25,330 --> 00:53:26,683
our own little schedules?

1095
00:53:27,660 --> 00:53:29,870
I can watch her most of the time.

1096
00:53:29,870 --> 00:53:32,320
That rent money might
come in pretty handy.

1097
00:53:32,320 --> 00:53:33,658
- Ma, I'm not renting the house.

1098
00:53:33,658 --> 00:53:36,257
Just let it go, will you?

1099
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:44,670
(birds chirping)

1100
00:53:50,719 --> 00:53:51,552
- [Bob] Robert.

1101
00:53:51,552 --> 00:53:52,385
- Bob.

1102
00:53:54,440 --> 00:53:55,602
- We got here a little early.

1103
00:53:55,602 --> 00:53:56,840
Anticipating.

1104
00:53:56,840 --> 00:53:58,680
- [Donna] Look who's here!

1105
00:53:58,680 --> 00:53:59,513
- Nice house.

1106
00:53:59,513 --> 00:54:01,440
- Yeah, tell me about it.

1107
00:54:04,067 --> 00:54:04,900
- Donna.

1108
00:54:04,900 --> 00:54:05,733
- Hello.

1109
00:54:07,230 --> 00:54:08,250
Beautiful home.

1110
00:54:08,250 --> 00:54:09,263
- Yeah, it sure is.

1111
00:54:10,793 --> 00:54:13,710
(doorbell ringing)

1112
00:54:14,620 --> 00:54:15,453
- Hey cutie.

1113
00:54:17,850 --> 00:54:19,110
- Hello.
- Oh my goodness.

1114
00:54:19,110 --> 00:54:20,503
- [Keith] Oh, these are
my in-laws and my folks.

1115
00:54:20,503 --> 00:54:21,623
- How do you do?

1116
00:54:21,623 --> 00:54:22,620
I'm Edna Humphries.

1117
00:54:22,620 --> 00:54:23,940
Come on in.
- I'm Donna.

1118
00:54:31,460 --> 00:54:33,320
- Can I offer anybody anything?

1119
00:54:33,320 --> 00:54:34,295
Something to drink?

1120
00:54:34,295 --> 00:54:35,128
- No thanks.
- Keith, Mrs. Lussier?

1121
00:54:35,128 --> 00:54:35,981
- No thank you.

1122
00:54:35,981 --> 00:54:36,814
- No?

1123
00:54:36,814 --> 00:54:37,647
Well okay.

1124
00:54:39,060 --> 00:54:41,840
Well, let's get started.

1125
00:54:41,840 --> 00:54:44,680
First of all, Mrs. Sergeant,

1126
00:54:44,680 --> 00:54:46,840
she's the founder of our agency,

1127
00:54:46,840 --> 00:54:48,200
wanted to be here today but

1128
00:54:49,150 --> 00:54:51,130
there was a small emergency
at the head office

1129
00:54:51,130 --> 00:54:53,040
so she couldn't make it.

1130
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:55,951
But she and I have talked
at great length and,

1131
00:54:55,951 --> 00:54:59,430
(Brittany babbling)

1132
00:54:59,430 --> 00:55:01,991
she certainly likes to read, doesn't she?

1133
00:55:01,991 --> 00:55:02,824
- Yeah.

1134
00:55:03,720 --> 00:55:05,020
Yeah, she hardly ever cries too,

1135
00:55:05,020 --> 00:55:06,971
she eats anything you put in front of her.

1136
00:55:06,971 --> 00:55:09,880
- I think she's the healthiest
baby I've ever seen.

1137
00:55:09,880 --> 00:55:10,713
- Yeah.

1138
00:55:10,713 --> 00:55:11,546
She's teething a bit now

1139
00:55:11,546 --> 00:55:13,300
so she's gets a little
fussy, but she's great.

1140
00:55:13,300 --> 00:55:15,400
- Keith is a wonderful father.

1141
00:55:15,400 --> 00:55:17,370
You should see him with her.

1142
00:55:17,370 --> 00:55:20,310
We can hardly get him out of the house.

1143
00:55:20,310 --> 00:55:22,270
Of course he has a
wonderful support system

1144
00:55:22,270 --> 00:55:25,910
if he would just let
Marge and me be grandmas

1145
00:55:25,910 --> 00:55:26,743
once in a while.

1146
00:55:26,743 --> 00:55:28,190
- So when is the adoption finalized?

1147
00:55:32,560 --> 00:55:33,393
- Well.

1148
00:55:34,580 --> 00:55:35,633
We have a problem.

1149
00:55:42,390 --> 00:55:44,773
We don't really allow
single parent adoptions.

1150
00:55:46,910 --> 00:55:47,743
- What do you mean?

1151
00:55:47,743 --> 00:55:50,090
- I went over and over
it with Mrs. Sergeant.

1152
00:55:50,090 --> 00:55:51,370
She won't even consider it.

1153
00:55:51,370 --> 00:55:52,203
- Wait, wait a minute, wait a minute.

1154
00:55:52,203 --> 00:55:54,630
- It has nothing to do with
you being a good parent,

1155
00:55:54,630 --> 00:55:55,647
I want you to understand that.

1156
00:55:55,647 --> 00:55:58,800
- Are you saying that you're
not gonna go through with this?

1157
00:55:58,800 --> 00:55:59,633
- I'm afraid so.

1158
00:55:59,633 --> 00:56:02,890
It's been the agency's
policy since the beginning.

1159
00:56:02,890 --> 00:56:04,300
No single parent adoption.

1160
00:56:04,300 --> 00:56:06,440
- No wait, there's got to
be something that we can do.

1161
00:56:06,440 --> 00:56:07,280
- There isn't.

1162
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:08,131
- Well how's this gonna work?

1163
00:56:08,131 --> 00:56:09,643
What'll happen to Brittany?

1164
00:56:13,950 --> 00:56:15,270
- I'm afraid I'm gonna have to place her

1165
00:56:15,270 --> 00:56:16,420
with another family.

1166
00:56:16,420 --> 00:56:18,550
- Oh no you won't!
- What?!

1167
00:56:18,550 --> 00:56:19,383
- [Marge] I knew it.

1168
00:56:19,383 --> 00:56:20,290
I knew something was wrong!

1169
00:56:20,290 --> 00:56:21,123
- Mom, please.

1170
00:56:21,123 --> 00:56:21,956
- They want to take

1171
00:56:21,956 --> 00:56:22,789
this child, Keith!
- Mom please!

1172
00:56:22,789 --> 00:56:24,020
Dad, will you help me out please?

1173
00:56:24,020 --> 00:56:26,461
Edna, come on, there's
something we could do here.

1174
00:56:26,461 --> 00:56:27,650
- Keith, listen, I've been pleading

1175
00:56:27,650 --> 00:56:29,140
with Mrs. Sergeant all week long.

1176
00:56:29,140 --> 00:56:30,200
It's all my fault.

1177
00:56:30,200 --> 00:56:32,260
- What if we can convince,

1178
00:56:32,260 --> 00:56:33,270
what if we can prove to her

1179
00:56:33,270 --> 00:56:34,820
that Keith has all the
support in the world?

1180
00:56:34,820 --> 00:56:36,170
We can bring in Aunts, Uncles, anybody.

1181
00:56:36,170 --> 00:56:37,650
- Wont' do any good.

1182
00:56:37,650 --> 00:56:38,483
- [Bob] How do you know?

1183
00:56:38,483 --> 00:56:39,316
You don't know.

1184
00:56:39,316 --> 00:56:40,380
We could set up a schedule,

1185
00:56:40,380 --> 00:56:41,690
have everybody's times laid out.

1186
00:56:41,690 --> 00:56:43,980
- Or we could adopt Brittany.

1187
00:56:43,980 --> 00:56:45,510
Me and Bob.

1188
00:56:45,510 --> 00:56:46,851
- [Edna] No.

1189
00:56:46,851 --> 00:56:47,684
- This isn't over yet.
- But she belongs.

1190
00:56:47,684 --> 00:56:48,750
- [Bob] This isn't over yet.

1191
00:56:48,750 --> 00:56:49,690
We'll work it out.
- Bob.

1192
00:56:49,690 --> 00:56:52,243
- I'm afraid you're gonna have
to leave the baby with me.

1193
00:56:53,223 --> 00:56:54,240
- What, now, today?

1194
00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:56,541
- This doesn't make any sense.
- Yes.

1195
00:56:56,541 --> 00:56:57,740
- [Marge] What's she talking about?

1196
00:56:57,740 --> 00:56:58,830
- [Robert] You haven't
heard the last of us.

1197
00:56:58,830 --> 00:56:59,663
- What if I don't?

1198
00:56:59,663 --> 00:57:02,200
What if we just walk
out the door with her?

1199
00:57:02,200 --> 00:57:03,610
- You can't.

1200
00:57:03,610 --> 00:57:04,730
You have to understand,

1201
00:57:04,730 --> 00:57:06,793
this baby is not legally yours.

1202
00:57:07,940 --> 00:57:08,986
I'm sorry,

1203
00:57:08,986 --> 00:57:10,897
I am so sorry.
- Doesn't make any sense.

1204
00:57:10,897 --> 00:57:12,202
- I'm sorry.
- Let's not make a scene.

1205
00:57:12,202 --> 00:57:13,346
- [Donna] Is she saying

1206
00:57:13,346 --> 00:57:15,404
that they're going to take her away?

1207
00:57:15,404 --> 00:57:16,283
- [Bob] They're saying-

1208
00:57:16,283 --> 00:57:17,793
- [Edna] I'm sorry, I am so sorry.

1209
00:57:17,793 --> 00:57:19,043
- [Robert] This is crazy!

1210
00:57:20,408 --> 00:57:22,991
(somber music)

1211
00:57:29,865 --> 00:57:31,935
- It's gonna be okay,
it's gonna be all right.

1212
00:57:31,935 --> 00:57:32,768
Listen, Keith.

1213
00:57:32,768 --> 00:57:34,670
Soon as we get back,
we'll call our lawyer.

1214
00:57:34,670 --> 00:57:35,503
You know there's gotta be something

1215
00:57:35,503 --> 00:57:37,520
that we can do to fight this thing.

1216
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:38,501
- [Robert] Let's go.

1217
00:57:38,501 --> 00:57:39,337
- [Bob] You know?

1218
00:57:39,337 --> 00:57:41,004
- [Robert] Let's go.

1219
00:57:42,313 --> 00:57:43,646
Let's go, Keith.

1220
00:57:58,147 --> 00:58:01,209
(tense music)

1221
00:58:01,209 --> 00:58:02,042
- Wait.

1222
00:58:03,426 --> 00:58:04,843
- [Robert] Keith.

1223
00:58:06,168 --> 00:58:09,567
(door knocking)

1224
00:58:09,567 --> 00:58:10,400
Keith?

1225
00:58:13,062 --> 00:58:15,105
(doorbell ringing)

1226
00:58:15,105 --> 00:58:16,410
- Edna!

1227
00:58:16,410 --> 00:58:17,623
I forgot Brittany's toy.

1228
00:58:19,675 --> 00:58:20,508
Edna!

1229
00:58:22,046 --> 00:58:25,516
Edna, Edna, she can't
sleep without Mr. Pig.

1230
00:58:25,516 --> 00:58:27,591
(door knocking)

1231
00:58:27,591 --> 00:58:28,424
Edna.

1232
00:58:32,773 --> 00:58:33,790
Edna!

1233
00:58:33,790 --> 00:58:36,064
(door knocking)

1234
00:58:36,064 --> 00:58:36,897
Edna.

1235
00:58:39,494 --> 00:58:42,661
Edna, she can't sleep without Mr. Pig.

1236
00:58:44,366 --> 00:58:46,949
(car starting)

1237
00:59:20,543 --> 00:59:21,918
- [Man] Is that the same problem?

1238
00:59:21,918 --> 00:59:22,751
- No.

1239
00:59:22,751 --> 00:59:24,447
- All right, have you
worked out their schedule?

1240
00:59:24,447 --> 00:59:25,280
- Not yet.

1241
00:59:26,196 --> 00:59:27,607
Do you want a high rate than..

1242
00:59:27,607 --> 00:59:28,440
- Yeah.

1243
00:59:44,500 --> 00:59:45,760
Keith, I gotta be honest with you.

1244
00:59:45,760 --> 00:59:48,120
This will be an uphill battle all the way.

1245
00:59:48,120 --> 00:59:51,540
First of all, this Edna
Humphries was right.

1246
00:59:51,540 --> 00:59:52,820
Your contract with the agency

1247
00:59:52,820 --> 00:59:55,000
specifically forbids any
single parent adoptions.

1248
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:56,960
It also rules out adoptions

1249
00:59:56,960 --> 00:59:58,290
to anyone with a life-threatening disease.

1250
00:59:58,290 --> 00:59:59,990
- She got sick after we signed it.

1251
01:00:01,330 --> 01:00:02,601
- Okay, let's move on to the question,

1252
01:00:02,601 --> 01:00:04,280
what's in the best interest of the child?

1253
01:00:04,280 --> 01:00:06,880
A life with you, a single
guy on an hourly wage

1254
01:00:06,880 --> 01:00:08,930
or a home with a well-to-do couple

1255
01:00:08,930 --> 01:00:09,763
who already have another adopted child?

1256
01:00:09,763 --> 01:00:11,410
- Is that who they have lined up?

1257
01:00:11,410 --> 01:00:12,608
- No, that's where she's been placed.

1258
01:00:12,608 --> 01:00:13,908
The couple with the Volvo?

1259
01:00:15,770 --> 01:00:16,911
- They didn't waste any time.

1260
01:00:16,911 --> 01:00:18,520
- No, no, they didn't.

1261
01:00:18,520 --> 01:00:19,940
And that's not all.

1262
01:00:19,940 --> 01:00:22,260
We haven't even talked
about the court's usual bias

1263
01:00:22,260 --> 01:00:24,110
against single fathers.

1264
01:00:24,110 --> 01:00:26,090
Let's move on to the
question of your commitment.

1265
01:00:26,090 --> 01:00:27,120
- My commitment?

1266
01:00:27,120 --> 01:00:29,300
- Kim first contacted the agency.

1267
01:00:29,300 --> 01:00:30,380
She made all the appointments,

1268
01:00:30,380 --> 01:00:31,510
she filled out all the forms.

1269
01:00:31,510 --> 01:00:32,530
She wrote out all the checks.

1270
01:00:32,530 --> 01:00:35,180
So if I'm their lawyer, I'm gonna say

1271
01:00:35,180 --> 01:00:38,460
where was Mr. Lussier
during all this and why?

1272
01:00:38,460 --> 01:00:41,970
Why was he late to that first
rather crucial appointment?

1273
01:00:41,970 --> 01:00:45,430
Well, he was out playing golf or football,

1274
01:00:45,430 --> 01:00:46,623
or he was bowling.

1275
01:00:49,960 --> 01:00:50,793
- You know...

1276
01:00:52,500 --> 01:00:56,143
It's true, I didn't get it at first.

1277
01:00:58,090 --> 01:00:59,260
But then when Brit showed up,

1278
01:00:59,260 --> 01:01:00,690
I held her in my arms and...

1279
01:01:07,120 --> 01:01:08,260
So what are you saying?

1280
01:01:08,260 --> 01:01:09,100
Are you saying that it's hopeless,

1281
01:01:09,100 --> 01:01:10,200
I'm never gonna get Britt back?

1282
01:01:10,200 --> 01:01:11,060
- No, no.

1283
01:01:11,060 --> 01:01:12,407
I'm not saying that at all.

1284
01:01:12,407 --> 01:01:14,250
But what I am saying is that the deck

1285
01:01:14,250 --> 01:01:16,630
is stacked against you, Keith.

1286
01:01:16,630 --> 01:01:18,150
You better think long and hard about that

1287
01:01:18,150 --> 01:01:20,720
before you decide to go ahead with this.

1288
01:01:20,720 --> 01:01:23,001
- [Marge] So how much is
this lawyer going to cost?

1289
01:01:23,001 --> 01:01:24,743
- 2500 for the retainer.

1290
01:01:24,743 --> 01:01:26,030
- Ooh.

1291
01:01:26,030 --> 01:01:27,900
- And then it depends on how hard

1292
01:01:27,900 --> 01:01:29,790
the adoption agency fights us in court.

1293
01:01:29,790 --> 01:01:32,010
- Which is probably pretty hard.

1294
01:01:32,010 --> 01:01:34,920
- And all this is gonna
take place in Milwaukee?

1295
01:01:34,920 --> 01:01:36,855
- Yeah, that's where the
agency's home office is.

1296
01:01:36,855 --> 01:01:38,380
- That's a four hour commute.

1297
01:01:38,380 --> 01:01:39,950
- Well.

1298
01:01:39,950 --> 01:01:41,810
At some point I think that
I would probably end up

1299
01:01:41,810 --> 01:01:43,670
staying down there with Sam.

1300
01:01:43,670 --> 01:01:45,420
That's his name, Sam Turturro.

1301
01:01:45,420 --> 01:01:46,350
That's where his office is.

1302
01:01:46,350 --> 01:01:48,340
He's supposed to be one
of the best there is.

1303
01:01:48,340 --> 01:01:51,860
- Look, Keith, I don't want you
to misunderstand this, okay?

1304
01:01:51,860 --> 01:01:54,960
But you got to remember
that you got your whole life

1305
01:01:54,960 --> 01:01:55,793
ahead of you,

1306
01:01:55,793 --> 01:01:58,263
and right now you are in
a pretty emotional state.

1307
01:01:59,940 --> 01:02:02,140
- I'm not in an emotional
state, mom, I'm fine.

1308
01:02:02,140 --> 01:02:03,150
- You're fine?

1309
01:02:03,150 --> 01:02:04,930
You've just lost your wife.

1310
01:02:04,930 --> 01:02:07,530
Keith, your whole world has
been turned upside down.

1311
01:02:09,340 --> 01:02:11,380
- I promised Kim I'd
take care of Brittany.

1312
01:02:11,380 --> 01:02:14,040
- Well, the lawyer says
Brittany is in a good home

1313
01:02:14,040 --> 01:02:14,873
with good people.

1314
01:02:14,873 --> 01:02:16,803
- Who are not her parents, I am.

1315
01:02:18,047 --> 01:02:20,430
I'm the only father she's ever known, Ma.

1316
01:02:20,430 --> 01:02:22,620
- Keith, she's a baby.

1317
01:02:22,620 --> 01:02:24,480
And all I'm saying is that you need time

1318
01:02:24,480 --> 01:02:25,517
for all of this to sink in.

1319
01:02:25,517 --> 01:02:26,750
- But I don't have time!

1320
01:02:26,750 --> 01:02:28,400
- Well you should find some time!

1321
01:02:29,280 --> 01:02:31,470
They're not gonna save
your job for you forever.

1322
01:02:31,470 --> 01:02:33,010
And you're talking
about spending thousands

1323
01:02:33,010 --> 01:02:34,270
and thousands of dollars on something

1324
01:02:34,270 --> 01:02:35,873
that really, we cannot afford!

1325
01:02:43,290 --> 01:02:44,386
- I have money of my own,

1326
01:02:44,386 --> 01:02:47,040
and the Minkowitzes were gonna help.

1327
01:02:47,040 --> 01:02:49,290
- Oh yes, of course, the Minkowitzes.

1328
01:02:49,290 --> 01:02:50,123
- Marge.

1329
01:02:50,123 --> 01:02:51,070
- What are you all gonna
do, just waltz in there

1330
01:02:51,070 --> 01:02:51,973
and give all this money to a lawyer

1331
01:02:51,973 --> 01:02:53,698
who doesn't even know if he can win it?

1332
01:02:53,698 --> 01:02:54,531
- That's not the point, mom.

1333
01:02:54,531 --> 01:02:55,940
- It is the point!

1334
01:02:55,940 --> 01:02:57,410
He already told you.

1335
01:02:57,410 --> 01:02:58,830
The court is not on your side.

1336
01:02:58,830 --> 01:03:00,480
They very seldom ever reward custody

1337
01:03:00,480 --> 01:03:01,530
to a single father!

1338
01:03:01,530 --> 01:03:02,363
- You think that's fair?

1339
01:03:02,363 --> 01:03:03,490
- No I don't think it's fair,

1340
01:03:03,490 --> 01:03:04,530
but that's the way it is, Keith

1341
01:03:04,530 --> 01:03:05,550
and you're not going to change it.

1342
01:03:05,550 --> 01:03:07,240
- Let me ask you something, ma.

1343
01:03:07,240 --> 01:03:08,440
How much would you spend to get me back

1344
01:03:08,440 --> 01:03:09,450
when I was eight months old?

1345
01:03:09,450 --> 01:03:10,390
- That's not the same thing.

1346
01:03:10,390 --> 01:03:11,670
- It is exactly the same thing,

1347
01:03:11,670 --> 01:03:13,270
you just don't want to see it.

1348
01:03:13,270 --> 01:03:14,190
In fact now that I think about it,

1349
01:03:14,190 --> 01:03:15,640
I'm just doing the same
thing you're doing.

1350
01:03:15,640 --> 01:03:17,470
I'm just trying to get my kid back.

1351
01:03:17,470 --> 01:03:19,183
- I'm not...

1352
01:03:19,183 --> 01:03:20,090
That's ridiculous.

1353
01:03:20,090 --> 01:03:21,660
- No, it's not ridiculous!

1354
01:03:21,660 --> 01:03:22,660
I'll tell you what's ridiculous, mom.

1355
01:03:22,660 --> 01:03:23,493
I'm a grown man,

1356
01:03:23,493 --> 01:03:24,970
you're treating me like
I'm in high school.

1357
01:03:24,970 --> 01:03:25,923
Just let me finish!

1358
01:03:27,610 --> 01:03:28,870
I am Brittany's dad.

1359
01:03:28,870 --> 01:03:31,390
And like any good dad, I
don't care what it costs.

1360
01:03:31,390 --> 01:03:32,640
Now I am going down to Milwaukee

1361
01:03:32,640 --> 01:03:33,860
and I am gonna do whatever it takes

1362
01:03:33,860 --> 01:03:34,933
to get my kid back!

1363
01:03:39,259 --> 01:03:40,810
All I got to say about this.

1364
01:03:43,141 --> 01:03:44,563
Let's just finish our dinner.

1365
01:03:48,150 --> 01:03:50,250
- Well we'll help you any way we can, son.

1366
01:03:51,731 --> 01:03:53,323
Can I have the salt please, Marge?

1367
01:03:58,658 --> 01:04:00,560
(men chattering)

1368
01:04:00,560 --> 01:04:02,420
- [Sam] Relax, you'll be fine.

1369
01:04:02,420 --> 01:04:04,855
- The whole thing, it just seems kind of,

1370
01:04:04,855 --> 01:04:06,153
I don't know, sleazy.

1371
01:04:09,020 --> 01:04:10,150
- Look, Keith.

1372
01:04:10,150 --> 01:04:11,850
Our best chance of getting her back

1373
01:04:11,850 --> 01:04:14,460
is to put pressure on the agency
and touch people's hearts.

1374
01:04:14,460 --> 01:04:15,730
Listen to me, listen to me.

1375
01:04:15,730 --> 01:04:16,890
If we pull this off,

1376
01:04:16,890 --> 01:04:19,640
we're gonna get a lot more
exposure down the line.

1377
01:04:19,640 --> 01:04:21,010
All right, now straighten your tie.

1378
01:04:21,010 --> 01:04:24,004
And smile for the camera.

1379
01:04:24,004 --> 01:04:27,254
(reporters chattering)

1380
01:04:28,939 --> 01:04:30,896
- Sam, are you satisfied
with this judge's decision

1381
01:04:30,896 --> 01:04:32,650
to hold a full adoption hearing?

1382
01:04:32,650 --> 01:04:33,483
- Yes, we are.

1383
01:04:33,483 --> 01:04:34,710
We're delighted with the decision.

1384
01:04:34,710 --> 01:04:37,355
It's all we wanted all along
is the chance to plead our case

1385
01:04:37,355 --> 01:04:38,188
in open court,

1386
01:04:38,188 --> 01:04:41,270
and prove that it was in
Brittany's best interest

1387
01:04:41,270 --> 01:04:43,020
to be reunited with Keith here.

1388
01:04:43,020 --> 01:04:44,330
- [Reporter] Keith,
have you seen Brittany?

1389
01:04:44,330 --> 01:04:46,016
Have you had any contact with her?

1390
01:04:46,016 --> 01:04:47,272
- Rob, hurry, he's on!
- No I haven't

1391
01:04:47,272 --> 01:04:48,393
but I'm sure she's being
well taken care of.

1392
01:04:48,393 --> 01:04:49,610
- Rob?
- If you lose the case,

1393
01:04:49,610 --> 01:04:51,053
will you appeal?
- He's on.

1394
01:04:51,053 --> 01:04:52,130
- No I won't.

1395
01:04:52,130 --> 01:04:53,310
- Why not?

1396
01:04:53,310 --> 01:04:54,240
- Well from what I understand

1397
01:04:54,240 --> 01:04:55,880
an appeal can take up to a year more

1398
01:04:55,880 --> 01:04:56,850
and I just don't think that would be

1399
01:04:56,850 --> 01:04:58,230
the best thing for Brittany.

1400
01:04:58,230 --> 01:05:00,230
- And so the stage is
set for a custody battle

1401
01:05:00,230 --> 01:05:01,210
that seems to have captured

1402
01:05:01,210 --> 01:05:03,690
the public's imagination and heart.

1403
01:05:03,690 --> 01:05:05,920
Since the story broke on a
Milwaukee television station

1404
01:05:05,920 --> 01:05:07,970
a week ago, Keith Lussier has been swamped

1405
01:05:07,970 --> 01:05:09,500
with letters of support,

1406
01:05:09,500 --> 01:05:11,820
and with requests to appear on talk shows

1407
01:05:11,820 --> 01:05:13,850
and newscasts all across the country.

1408
01:05:13,850 --> 01:05:15,440
There's even a petition being circulated

1409
01:05:15,440 --> 01:05:16,940
by other adoptive parents,

1410
01:05:16,940 --> 01:05:20,160
some of them clients of the
Good Home Adoption Agency itself

1411
01:05:20,160 --> 01:05:22,080
urging its founder Edith Sergeant

1412
01:05:22,080 --> 01:05:25,050
to let the little girl return to Lussier.

1413
01:05:25,050 --> 01:05:26,340
And on yet another front,

1414
01:05:26,340 --> 01:05:28,540
the case has also become
something of cause to live

1415
01:05:28,540 --> 01:05:29,940
for single fathers.

1416
01:05:29,940 --> 01:05:31,240
Especially when it was learned

1417
01:05:31,240 --> 01:05:32,800
that the Milwaukee based agency

1418
01:05:32,800 --> 01:05:35,590
had actually allowed some
single parent adoptions.

1419
01:05:35,590 --> 01:05:37,390
But in every one of those cases,

1420
01:05:37,390 --> 01:05:38,980
the parent was a mother.

1421
01:05:38,980 --> 01:05:40,470
- [Reporter] Keith,
how tough is this case?

1422
01:05:40,470 --> 01:05:41,613
- Oh, well.

1423
01:05:42,660 --> 01:05:44,391
Gosh, I don't know.

1424
01:05:44,391 --> 01:05:45,224
It's been tough.

1425
01:05:46,340 --> 01:05:47,673
I mean, since I lost Kim

1426
01:05:47,673 --> 01:05:49,273
I haven't really had a chance...

1427
01:05:50,350 --> 01:05:51,660
Anyway, it's pretty hard.

1428
01:05:51,660 --> 01:05:53,934
All I'm trying to do here
is get my daughter back.

1429
01:05:53,934 --> 01:05:56,174
- So you're gonna be making
the talk show circuit now?

1430
01:05:56,174 --> 01:05:57,414
- Oh, I don't know about that.

1431
01:05:57,414 --> 01:05:59,080
- [Sam] Just a few of them, maybe.

1432
01:05:59,080 --> 01:06:02,210
- So how long has it been
since you've been home?

1433
01:06:03,215 --> 01:06:04,565
- It's been a little while.

1434
01:06:05,920 --> 01:06:08,824
- I'm sorry that
everything is such a mess.

1435
01:06:08,824 --> 01:06:10,176
He hasn't had time.

1436
01:06:10,176 --> 01:06:12,013
Oh, excuse me, he did face all that.

1437
01:06:12,013 --> 01:06:14,540
(phone ringing)
- Bedroom is upstairs

1438
01:06:14,540 --> 01:06:15,373
for the baby.

1439
01:06:15,373 --> 01:06:16,595
I don't know where you wanna start.

1440
01:06:16,595 --> 01:06:19,345
(men chattering)

1441
01:06:22,151 --> 01:06:22,984
- Hello?

1442
01:06:22,984 --> 01:06:24,268
- Hi, Donna, it's me.

1443
01:06:24,268 --> 01:06:25,740
Did they get there all right?

1444
01:06:25,740 --> 01:06:27,210
- [Donna] Oh, yes, yes, they're here.

1445
01:06:27,210 --> 01:06:28,490
They're just starting now.

1446
01:06:28,490 --> 01:06:29,323
- Okay.

1447
01:06:30,600 --> 01:06:31,692
- Hold on a minute.

1448
01:06:31,692 --> 01:06:32,770
- Chuck.

1449
01:06:32,770 --> 01:06:34,690
What I wanna do is let's
start with a close up

1450
01:06:34,690 --> 01:06:35,523
of the high chair, okay?

1451
01:06:35,523 --> 01:06:38,160
And then we'll tilt up and
we'll pan around the room, okay?

1452
01:06:38,160 --> 01:06:40,397
- Sorry, I'm just trying to stay

1453
01:06:40,397 --> 01:06:42,120
out of the way here.

1454
01:06:42,120 --> 01:06:43,350
- I really appreciate it, Donna.

1455
01:06:43,350 --> 01:06:44,500
It shouldn't take them that long.

1456
01:06:44,500 --> 01:06:46,140
- Oh, that's okay.

1457
01:06:46,140 --> 01:06:47,840
We're glad to help.

1458
01:06:47,840 --> 01:06:49,510
So how's it going down there?

1459
01:06:49,510 --> 01:06:52,560
- Oh, it's kind of crazy, but you know,

1460
01:06:52,560 --> 01:06:53,393
the more support we get,

1461
01:06:53,393 --> 01:06:54,922
the better chance we have so,

1462
01:06:54,922 --> 01:06:57,141
- When are you coming home?

1463
01:06:57,141 --> 01:06:59,713
- Well, I'm not really sure, I mean,

1464
01:06:59,713 --> 01:07:02,036
I got the hearing coming
up and everything, so.

1465
01:07:02,036 --> 01:07:04,350
- Oh, we saw you on the news.

1466
01:07:04,350 --> 01:07:05,714
- Oh, I was nervous.

1467
01:07:05,714 --> 01:07:06,940
- [Donna] You looked very handsome.

1468
01:07:06,940 --> 01:07:09,620
- Thanks, you just speak as a mom.

1469
01:07:09,620 --> 01:07:10,550
- Yeah, yes I am.

1470
01:07:16,427 --> 01:07:17,700
I think it would be really good

1471
01:07:17,700 --> 01:07:20,080
if you could come home for a few days.

1472
01:07:20,080 --> 01:07:20,913
Or just,

1473
01:07:22,640 --> 01:07:24,033
just maybe in a day.

1474
01:07:31,250 --> 01:07:32,750
I'm sorry.

1475
01:07:32,750 --> 01:07:34,350
- Are you okay?

1476
01:07:34,350 --> 01:07:35,610
- I mean I know you're busy

1477
01:07:35,610 --> 01:07:37,863
and I don't mean to be a pest, but I just,

1478
01:07:39,870 --> 01:07:42,063
I just need to go through her things.

1479
01:07:44,878 --> 01:07:46,580
And you do too.

1480
01:07:46,580 --> 01:07:48,380
I mean, I know it's hard

1481
01:07:48,380 --> 01:07:50,925
but you can't keep avoiding it.

1482
01:07:50,925 --> 01:07:52,260
I don't mean, I don't mean...

1483
01:07:53,620 --> 01:07:54,573
I'm sorry, honey.

1484
01:08:00,280 --> 01:08:01,600
- Hey, buddy, how you holding up?

1485
01:08:01,600 --> 01:08:03,600
- Oh, fine, fine.

1486
01:08:03,600 --> 01:08:06,830
Listen, I'm sorry I
can't get home right now.

1487
01:08:06,830 --> 01:08:08,340
- Hey, listen, you do what you have to do.

1488
01:08:08,340 --> 01:08:09,340
Brittany comes first.

1489
01:08:09,340 --> 01:08:11,260
We're all behind you
on that, you know that.

1490
01:08:11,260 --> 01:08:13,060
Listen, there's an insurance guy

1491
01:08:13,060 --> 01:08:14,300
gonna be getting in touch
with you down there.

1492
01:08:14,300 --> 01:08:15,310
- Okay, what for?

1493
01:08:15,310 --> 01:08:16,143
- Excuse me folks.

1494
01:08:16,143 --> 01:08:17,140
We're about to start rolling.

1495
01:08:17,140 --> 01:08:18,123
- Okay, thanks.

1496
01:08:18,976 --> 01:08:20,160
Listen, don't worry about it.

1497
01:08:20,160 --> 01:08:21,500
It's just some paperwork.

1498
01:08:21,500 --> 01:08:23,230
I'll call you about it later, all right?

1499
01:08:23,230 --> 01:08:24,063
- [Keith] Okay.

1500
01:08:24,063 --> 01:08:25,610
- Give him my love.

1501
01:08:25,610 --> 01:08:26,443
- Did you hear?

1502
01:08:26,443 --> 01:08:27,620
- Yeah, yeah.

1503
01:08:27,620 --> 01:08:29,220
Send her my love too, all right?

1504
01:08:30,110 --> 01:08:31,300
Thanks, thanks a lot.

1505
01:08:31,300 --> 01:08:32,280
- You take care of yourself, huh?

1506
01:08:32,280 --> 01:08:33,113
- You too.

1507
01:08:33,113 --> 01:08:33,946
Bye.

1508
01:08:39,202 --> 01:08:40,260
(somber music)

1509
01:08:40,260 --> 01:08:43,320
- Brittany's high chair,
jars of baby food,

1510
01:08:43,320 --> 01:08:45,620
everything left just as it was.

1511
01:08:45,620 --> 01:08:48,620
So in this little house on
the outskirts of Madison,

1512
01:08:48,620 --> 01:08:50,300
far away from the reporters

1513
01:08:50,300 --> 01:08:52,320
and the need to appear calm and composed,

1514
01:08:52,320 --> 01:08:54,833
Keith Lussier mourns for his wife alone.

1515
01:08:56,660 --> 01:08:59,400
Sitting in this empty room
surrounded by old pictures

1516
01:08:59,400 --> 01:09:00,403
and photo albums,

1517
01:09:01,380 --> 01:09:03,370
all they can do now is try to get through

1518
01:09:03,370 --> 01:09:05,260
another day without her,

1519
01:09:05,260 --> 01:09:07,340
and fight for the little girl

1520
01:09:07,340 --> 01:09:09,477
that both of them thought was their own.

1521
01:09:11,203 --> 01:09:13,127
This is Paul Jacobs reporting.

1522
01:09:20,305 --> 01:09:21,210
(cars honking)

1523
01:09:21,210 --> 01:09:23,800
- The battle for Brittany
nears its climax today

1524
01:09:23,800 --> 01:09:26,110
here at Milwaukee's historic courthouse

1525
01:09:26,110 --> 01:09:28,038
in the courtroom of
Judge Harriot Richardson.

1526
01:09:28,038 --> 01:09:30,600
- [Reporter] A child would
have a mother and a father.

1527
01:09:30,600 --> 01:09:32,448
And that is the real issue here.

1528
01:09:32,448 --> 01:09:34,417
Lussier may be a good father,
- The court of public opinion

1529
01:09:34,417 --> 01:09:37,923
will carry over to the
Wisconsin Supreme Court.

1530
01:09:37,923 --> 01:09:40,102
- News today that this is the day

1531
01:09:40,102 --> 01:09:41,593
that Keith Lussier was waiting for

1532
01:09:41,593 --> 01:09:43,170
since his adopted daughter
was taken from him

1533
01:09:43,170 --> 01:09:44,380
two weeks ago.

1534
01:09:44,380 --> 01:09:47,000
Judge Richardson will very
shortly hear arguments

1535
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:48,170
and decide whether baby Brittany

1536
01:09:48,170 --> 01:09:49,910
should be returned to her adoptive father.

1537
01:09:49,910 --> 01:09:52,128
One person very interested
in that decision

1538
01:09:52,128 --> 01:09:54,870
is Edith Sergeant, founder and president

1539
01:09:54,870 --> 01:09:56,598
of the Good Home Adoption Agency.

1540
01:09:56,598 --> 01:09:58,820
Mrs. Sergeant, what do you
think of Mr. Lussier's claims

1541
01:09:58,820 --> 01:10:01,460
that your agency mishandled
baby Brittany's case?

1542
01:10:01,460 --> 01:10:03,390
- There is nothing wrong with the way

1543
01:10:03,390 --> 01:10:05,400
we handled the situation.

1544
01:10:05,400 --> 01:10:07,830
We promised the child's biological mother

1545
01:10:07,830 --> 01:10:11,300
that her baby would have a
loving father and mother.

1546
01:10:11,300 --> 01:10:14,020
- But all accounts, Mr.
Lussier is a good father.

1547
01:10:14,020 --> 01:10:15,690
- That is not the issue.

1548
01:10:15,690 --> 01:10:18,210
The issue is what's best for the child,

1549
01:10:18,210 --> 01:10:20,390
not what's best for Mr. Lussier.

1550
01:10:20,390 --> 01:10:22,630
- Your honor, let's be
clear about something.

1551
01:10:22,630 --> 01:10:24,330
This child was placed
in this couple's home

1552
01:10:24,330 --> 01:10:25,910
on a temporary basis,

1553
01:10:25,910 --> 01:10:28,240
with a written understanding
that their eligibility

1554
01:10:28,240 --> 01:10:30,683
would be reviewed six
months down the line.

1555
01:10:31,670 --> 01:10:34,390
Now, what the agency
did not know at the time

1556
01:10:34,390 --> 01:10:37,090
because it had not been fully informed

1557
01:10:37,090 --> 01:10:39,940
was that Kimberly Lussier had
a life-threatening disease.

1558
01:10:39,940 --> 01:10:41,040
If it had known this,

1559
01:10:41,040 --> 01:10:42,630
the agency would never have place a child

1560
01:10:42,630 --> 01:10:45,080
with this couple in the first place.

1561
01:10:45,080 --> 01:10:46,560
Only after Mrs. Lussier's death

1562
01:10:46,560 --> 01:10:48,277
did the agency learn of this tragedy.

1563
01:10:48,277 --> 01:10:50,270
And as difficult as it was,

1564
01:10:50,270 --> 01:10:51,690
the agency ultimately made a decision

1565
01:10:51,690 --> 01:10:54,140
that was in the best
interest of the child.

1566
01:10:54,140 --> 01:10:57,520
Namely, to remove it from what
was now a house of mourning,

1567
01:10:57,520 --> 01:10:58,670
place it in a more stable home

1568
01:10:58,670 --> 01:11:00,970
where there was already
another adopted child.

1569
01:11:02,160 --> 01:11:02,993
Thank you, you honor.

1570
01:11:02,993 --> 01:11:03,826
I kept my remarks brief,

1571
01:11:03,826 --> 01:11:04,930
we are anxious to proceed.

1572
01:11:10,450 --> 01:11:12,050
- First of all, your honor,

1573
01:11:12,050 --> 01:11:15,120
not only did Mr. Lussier
fully inform the agency

1574
01:11:15,120 --> 01:11:16,930
about the severity of
his wife's condition,

1575
01:11:16,930 --> 01:11:19,980
but this was well in advance
of the baby's arrival.

1576
01:11:19,980 --> 01:11:22,430
In fact, Kim was undergoing chemotherapy

1577
01:11:22,430 --> 01:11:24,230
when Edna Humphries called her

1578
01:11:24,230 --> 01:11:26,560
to tell her when the baby was coming in.

1579
01:11:26,560 --> 01:11:30,330
Secondly, in regards to this
house of mourning suggestion

1580
01:11:30,330 --> 01:11:31,890
by Mr. Schiller,

1581
01:11:31,890 --> 01:11:34,160
nothing could be farther from the truth.

1582
01:11:34,160 --> 01:11:36,230
It was at Kim's insistence herself

1583
01:11:36,230 --> 01:11:37,900
that no one even cry around the baby

1584
01:11:37,900 --> 01:11:39,050
so as not to upset her.

1585
01:11:40,007 --> 01:11:42,690
"We've all got to stay
positive for Brittany",

1586
01:11:42,690 --> 01:11:43,610
Kim was always saying,

1587
01:11:43,610 --> 01:11:46,693
and that attitude continues
to this day with Mr. Lussier.

1588
01:11:48,042 --> 01:11:48,875
Thank you.

1589
01:11:56,055 --> 01:11:57,580
But it was a week later
after the operation

1590
01:11:57,580 --> 01:11:59,660
that Kim called you herself, didn't she?

1591
01:11:59,660 --> 01:12:01,500
Soon as she got home from the hospital.

1592
01:12:01,500 --> 01:12:02,550
- [Edna] Yes, she did.

1593
01:12:02,550 --> 01:12:04,860
- [Sam] And what did
she say, Mrs. Humphries?

1594
01:12:04,860 --> 01:12:06,230
- [Edna] She said that
the doctors had gotten

1595
01:12:06,230 --> 01:12:07,790
99% of the cancer

1596
01:12:07,790 --> 01:12:10,190
and that they were
confident the chemotherapy

1597
01:12:10,190 --> 01:12:12,070
would take care of the rest.

1598
01:12:12,070 --> 01:12:13,872
- [Sam] And did you believe her?

1599
01:12:13,872 --> 01:12:16,490
- [Edna] I wanted to believe her.

1600
01:12:16,490 --> 01:12:17,848
- Why?

1601
01:12:17,848 --> 01:12:18,681
- Why?

1602
01:12:19,740 --> 01:12:22,510
Because she was a lovely
young woman full of life.

1603
01:12:22,510 --> 01:12:23,677
And because they had named the baby

1604
01:12:23,677 --> 01:12:25,860
and the nursery was all set up.

1605
01:12:25,860 --> 01:12:28,460
- [Sam] And so, why was it
that she was calling you?

1606
01:12:29,350 --> 01:12:31,040
- She wanted to know if
they could still adopt

1607
01:12:31,040 --> 01:12:32,293
this particular child.

1608
01:12:34,070 --> 01:12:36,400
- And as you said, you knew
she had cancer at that time.

1609
01:12:36,400 --> 01:12:38,900
Did you ask to see any medical reports

1610
01:12:38,900 --> 01:12:41,200
or tell her you wanted
to talk to her doctors?

1611
01:12:45,790 --> 01:12:46,623
- No.

1612
01:12:47,700 --> 01:12:49,123
- [Sam] Well what did you tell her?

1613
01:12:51,880 --> 01:12:52,880
- I told her that...

1614
01:12:57,410 --> 01:12:59,280
That we would just keep this to ourselves

1615
01:12:59,280 --> 01:13:01,330
because I was sure she was gonna be fine.

1616
01:13:02,713 --> 01:13:04,010
- And?

1617
01:13:04,010 --> 01:13:04,843
- And...

1618
01:13:06,292 --> 01:13:08,720
That the baby was still theirs.

1619
01:13:08,720 --> 01:13:10,779
I wouldn't say a word to anyone.

1620
01:13:10,779 --> 01:13:13,208
(cameras clicking)
(reporters chattering)

1621
01:13:13,208 --> 01:13:14,768
- [Reporter] Does this make
your case for you, Sam?

1622
01:13:14,768 --> 01:13:15,601
Is it all welcome?

1623
01:13:15,601 --> 01:13:17,520
- No, no, no, not by a long shot.

1624
01:13:17,520 --> 01:13:19,950
We still have the whole
single parent debate to go

1625
01:13:19,950 --> 01:13:21,620
and what's best for the child now.

1626
01:13:21,620 --> 01:13:23,020
We're not calling this one over

1627
01:13:23,020 --> 01:13:25,050
until Judge Richardson renders her verdict

1628
01:13:25,050 --> 01:13:27,620
and hopefully Baby Brittany
is returned to her father.

1629
01:13:27,620 --> 01:13:28,885
- [Reporter] And when do
you expect the verdict?

1630
01:13:28,885 --> 01:13:29,972
Do you expect the verdict today?

1631
01:13:29,972 --> 01:13:32,903
- Well we still have an awful
lot of testimony to go, so.

1632
01:13:32,903 --> 01:13:35,213
- [Reporter] Keith, are you
taking the stand this afternoon?

1633
01:13:35,213 --> 01:13:36,880
- I believe so, yes.

1634
01:13:41,213 --> 01:13:42,880
- Is that your signature at the bottom

1635
01:13:42,880 --> 01:13:43,910
of the contract, Mr. Lussier?

1636
01:13:43,910 --> 01:13:44,743
- Yes.

1637
01:13:45,907 --> 01:13:47,957
- Would you please read stipulation nine?

1638
01:13:50,420 --> 01:13:53,040
- No couple with a known
life-threatening health condition

1639
01:13:53,040 --> 01:13:53,873
shall be approved.

1640
01:13:53,873 --> 01:13:55,470
But the point is we didn't know.

1641
01:13:55,470 --> 01:13:57,343
- I'll ask the questions, Mr. Lussier.

1642
01:13:58,660 --> 01:13:59,890
Yeah, one that's been bothering me

1643
01:13:59,890 --> 01:14:01,423
since the beginning is this.

1644
01:14:04,030 --> 01:14:05,011
Why did you leave this
child with a stranger

1645
01:14:05,011 --> 01:14:06,520
in the first place?

1646
01:14:06,520 --> 01:14:07,810
- Objection, your honor.

1647
01:14:07,810 --> 01:14:09,870
Edna Humphries was not a stranger.

1648
01:14:09,870 --> 01:14:12,360
- She was to the child, Mr. Turturro.

1649
01:14:12,360 --> 01:14:13,310
Overruled.

1650
01:14:13,310 --> 01:14:16,160
- I mean, you maintain
that she was absolutely

1651
01:14:16,160 --> 01:14:17,302
like your very own daughter.

1652
01:14:17,302 --> 01:14:18,135
- [Keith] Yes.

1653
01:14:18,135 --> 01:14:19,960
- And yet you left her
in Madison that day,

1654
01:14:19,960 --> 01:14:22,040
a child crying as you walked away.

1655
01:14:22,040 --> 01:14:23,620
So tell me, Mr. Lussier.

1656
01:14:23,620 --> 01:14:25,290
What kind of a parent would
leave their child like that

1657
01:14:25,290 --> 01:14:26,650
regardless of the circumstances?

1658
01:14:26,650 --> 01:14:28,430
- Edna said that she was going to have

1659
01:14:28,430 --> 01:14:29,370
to call the police.

1660
01:14:29,370 --> 01:14:31,630
- Because the child wasn't legally yours

1661
01:14:31,630 --> 01:14:33,650
which is exactly why
you left her, isn't it?

1662
01:14:33,650 --> 01:14:34,890
You recognized that fact.

1663
01:14:34,890 --> 01:14:36,230
- No, that's not true.

1664
01:14:36,230 --> 01:14:37,800
- Then why?

1665
01:14:37,800 --> 01:14:38,770
Why would you leave a crying child

1666
01:14:38,770 --> 01:14:39,973
in someone else's arms?

1667
01:14:49,390 --> 01:14:50,800
- I left her because...

1668
01:14:52,600 --> 01:14:54,240
I left her because sometimes

1669
01:14:54,240 --> 01:14:55,730
even though it breaks your heart

1670
01:14:55,730 --> 01:14:58,133
you have to do what's right for the kid.

1671
01:14:59,650 --> 01:15:02,960
Of course I wanted to take
Brittany away with me that day

1672
01:15:02,960 --> 01:15:04,130
and then never let her go

1673
01:15:04,130 --> 01:15:06,390
but then at the same time Edna had said

1674
01:15:06,390 --> 01:15:07,390
that they were gonna call the police

1675
01:15:07,390 --> 01:15:08,790
and get a court order and...

1676
01:15:09,721 --> 01:15:11,530
You know, I had this image,
this picture in my head.

1677
01:15:11,530 --> 01:15:15,290
It's crazy, but of us just
racing down the highway

1678
01:15:15,290 --> 01:15:17,290
in this chase.

1679
01:15:17,290 --> 01:15:20,230
And the police pulling us
over, and Brittany crying,

1680
01:15:20,230 --> 01:15:23,570
and the trip was just taken away.

1681
01:15:23,570 --> 01:15:26,663
So yeah, I left her with Edna.

1682
01:15:28,310 --> 01:15:32,310
But I promised her that
I would be back for her

1683
01:15:32,310 --> 01:15:36,363
and that's what this is
all about, Mr. Schiller.

1684
01:15:38,383 --> 01:15:40,920
I'm just trying to keep the promise I made

1685
01:15:40,920 --> 01:15:41,753
to my daughter.

1686
01:15:43,710 --> 01:15:45,663
I'm just trying to get my daughter back.

1687
01:16:06,610 --> 01:16:07,950
- Excuse me, gentlemen.

1688
01:16:07,950 --> 01:16:09,490
Sorry to interrupt.

1689
01:16:09,490 --> 01:16:11,730
I'm Elliot Carver with
Superior Mutual Insurance.

1690
01:16:11,730 --> 01:16:12,563
I know you're busy,

1691
01:16:12,563 --> 01:16:13,660
but if I could have just a few minutes

1692
01:16:13,660 --> 01:16:14,493
with Mr. Lussier here-

1693
01:16:14,493 --> 01:16:15,326
- About what?

1694
01:16:15,326 --> 01:16:16,370
- About his wife's life insurance.

1695
01:16:16,370 --> 01:16:17,540
- It's all right, Sam.

1696
01:16:17,540 --> 01:16:19,380
You already talked with my
father-in-law, didn't you?

1697
01:16:19,380 --> 01:16:20,213
- [Elliot] That's right.

1698
01:16:20,213 --> 01:16:21,046
- About what exactly?

1699
01:16:21,046 --> 01:16:23,040
I'm sorry, but is there
some kind of problem here?

1700
01:16:23,040 --> 01:16:25,120
- Well that's what I'm
supposed to find out.

1701
01:16:25,120 --> 01:16:26,850
The adoption agency is obviously claiming

1702
01:16:26,850 --> 01:16:28,160
that Keith and his wife knew she was ill

1703
01:16:28,160 --> 01:16:29,600
before the adoption.

1704
01:16:29,600 --> 01:16:31,700
Which means they concealed
this on their information.

1705
01:16:31,700 --> 01:16:32,533
- We didn't know.

1706
01:16:32,533 --> 01:16:33,366
- You know, I think we're gonna have

1707
01:16:33,366 --> 01:16:34,199
to talk about this another time.

1708
01:16:34,199 --> 01:16:35,420
- No, no, no, don't misunderstand me.

1709
01:16:35,420 --> 01:16:37,670
I believe you, I really do.

1710
01:16:37,670 --> 01:16:40,000
That's what I've written in my report.

1711
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:43,010
In fact, off the record,

1712
01:16:43,010 --> 01:16:45,380
I want to tell you how
much I admire your wife

1713
01:16:45,380 --> 01:16:47,230
hanging on until the activation date.

1714
01:16:48,857 --> 01:16:49,690
- What do you mean?

1715
01:16:49,690 --> 01:16:51,290
- Well, for the six months, I mean.

1716
01:16:52,860 --> 01:16:53,693
You didn't know?

1717
01:16:55,070 --> 01:16:55,903
- Know what?

1718
01:16:56,950 --> 01:16:58,690
- Mr. Lussier, the policy you bought

1719
01:16:58,690 --> 01:17:00,240
didn't come into effect until six months

1720
01:17:00,240 --> 01:17:01,840
after the date of signing.

1721
01:17:01,840 --> 01:17:03,810
That was on March the 6th.

1722
01:17:03,810 --> 01:17:05,050
Kim had it marked on the calendar

1723
01:17:05,050 --> 01:17:06,250
according to her father.

1724
01:17:07,190 --> 01:17:09,510
She held on until the night before

1725
01:17:09,510 --> 01:17:11,620
and then went back to the
hospital the following day

1726
01:17:11,620 --> 01:17:13,670
knowing that by then
you and your little girl

1727
01:17:13,670 --> 01:17:14,770
would be provided for.

1728
01:17:18,121 --> 01:17:23,121
(rain pattering)
(light music)

1729
01:18:30,551 --> 01:18:33,718
(gentle somber music)

1730
01:18:39,558 --> 01:18:42,558
(thunder rumbling)

1731
01:18:50,807 --> 01:18:53,307
- It's good to see you, Keith.

1732
01:18:57,740 --> 01:18:58,573
- It's weird.

1733
01:19:00,120 --> 01:19:02,520
It's like I don't even
believe it yet, you know?

1734
01:19:05,745 --> 01:19:07,995
Sometimes, the phone rings.

1735
01:19:09,254 --> 01:19:11,087
And then oh, it's Kim!

1736
01:19:12,370 --> 01:19:15,350
Or I'll be driving down the street

1737
01:19:15,350 --> 01:19:17,049
and I'll see something

1738
01:19:17,049 --> 01:19:19,923
and I think, I can't wait to get home.

1739
01:19:24,820 --> 01:19:26,403
I guess I feel like

1740
01:19:27,303 --> 01:19:30,640
that if I get Brittany back

1741
01:19:30,640 --> 01:19:32,350
I'll be getting part of Kim too.

1742
01:19:37,832 --> 01:19:42,832
I miss her so bad. (sobbing)

1743
01:19:48,590 --> 01:19:51,507
(thunder rumbling)

1744
01:19:55,428 --> 01:19:58,227
(reporters chattering)

1745
01:19:58,227 --> 01:20:00,810
- And so this is it, decision day.

1746
01:20:00,810 --> 01:20:03,040
At nine o'clock this
morning in department 14

1747
01:20:03,040 --> 01:20:05,050
at Milwaukee's historic courthouse,

1748
01:20:05,050 --> 01:20:07,540
Judge Harriot Richardson
will render a decision

1749
01:20:07,540 --> 01:20:10,323
that will affect a little
girl's life forever.

1750
01:20:12,132 --> 01:20:15,049
(crowd chattering)

1751
01:20:21,790 --> 01:20:22,840
- [Bailiff] All rise.

1752
01:20:24,230 --> 01:20:26,750
Milwaukee County Circuit
Court, Children's Division.

1753
01:20:26,750 --> 01:20:29,120
Department 14 is now in session.

1754
01:20:29,120 --> 01:20:31,473
The Honorable Judge Harriot
Richardson presiding.

1755
01:20:33,892 --> 01:20:34,803
You may be seated.

1756
01:20:38,644 --> 01:20:39,680
- All right.

1757
01:20:39,680 --> 01:20:41,780
I am prepared to enter findings of fact

1758
01:20:41,780 --> 01:20:43,340
and conclusions of law.

1759
01:20:43,340 --> 01:20:44,280
In the matter of Keith Lussier

1760
01:20:44,280 --> 01:20:46,693
versus the Good Home Adoption Agency.

1761
01:20:47,900 --> 01:20:50,253
But first of all, I'd
like to make an aside.

1762
01:20:51,270 --> 01:20:53,020
The Adoption Act does not,

1763
01:20:53,020 --> 01:20:54,790
and I repeat, does not determine

1764
01:20:54,790 --> 01:20:57,070
what is in the child's best interest.

1765
01:20:57,070 --> 01:20:59,940
In truth, we have no way of knowing

1766
01:20:59,940 --> 01:21:01,250
what the future holds for anyone,

1767
01:21:01,250 --> 01:21:02,363
much less a child.

1768
01:21:04,010 --> 01:21:07,020
What truly is in their best interest?

1769
01:21:07,020 --> 01:21:10,320
And so we are left with
a more reasonable basis

1770
01:21:10,320 --> 01:21:12,850
for deciding whether or not an
adoption should be approved.

1771
01:21:12,850 --> 01:21:16,290
And that is, is it or was it benefiting

1772
01:21:16,290 --> 01:21:18,440
the needs and welfare
of the subject child?

1773
01:21:19,420 --> 01:21:22,483
It is with this in mind I
make the following ruling.

1774
01:21:25,410 --> 01:21:28,980
In the case of Lussier versus
the Good Home Adoption Agency,

1775
01:21:28,980 --> 01:21:30,950
I find that the refusal of the agency

1776
01:21:30,950 --> 01:21:32,540
to consent to this adoption

1777
01:21:32,540 --> 01:21:34,340
was based primarily on the fact

1778
01:21:34,340 --> 01:21:37,160
that this had become a
single parent adoption

1779
01:21:37,160 --> 01:21:40,920
due to the untimely death of Mrs. Lussier.

1780
01:21:40,920 --> 01:21:43,470
I further find that by
the time of her death,

1781
01:21:43,470 --> 01:21:45,460
the child had become an integral member

1782
01:21:45,460 --> 01:21:48,020
of the Lussier home and extended family.

1783
01:21:48,020 --> 01:21:50,410
And because of this,
it would have been best

1784
01:21:50,410 --> 01:21:52,510
for her to have remained with that family.

1785
01:21:53,360 --> 01:21:55,010
I therefore find that the agency's

1786
01:21:55,010 --> 01:21:57,963
married couple requirement,
though well-intentioned,

1787
01:21:58,800 --> 01:22:01,033
is inapplicable in this particular case.

1788
01:22:02,610 --> 01:22:05,610
The Good Home Adoption
Agency is therefore ordered

1789
01:22:05,610 --> 01:22:08,550
to return physical custody
of the child in question

1790
01:22:08,550 --> 01:22:11,734
to Mr. Keith Lussier with all due haste.

1791
01:22:11,734 --> 01:22:15,188
(uplifting music)
(Bob cheering)

1792
01:22:15,188 --> 01:22:18,105
(crowd applauding)

1793
01:22:22,603 --> 01:22:23,436
- Oh!

1794
01:22:51,149 --> 01:22:54,066
(crowd chattering)

1795
01:23:01,164 --> 01:23:03,664
(light music)

1796
01:23:17,194 --> 01:23:18,444
- [Edna] Keith!

1797
01:23:22,610 --> 01:23:24,600
- (sighing) Hi.

1798
01:23:24,600 --> 01:23:25,433
- Welcome.

1799
01:23:27,820 --> 01:23:29,460
Oh.

1800
01:23:29,460 --> 01:23:31,310
Come on in, she's in the living room.

1801
01:23:37,690 --> 01:23:38,810
She's in here.

1802
01:23:40,650 --> 01:23:41,483
- Maybe you should go first.

1803
01:23:41,483 --> 01:23:42,630
She might not remember me.

1804
01:23:42,630 --> 01:23:44,718
- Oh, she'll remember you.

1805
01:23:44,718 --> 01:23:45,551
- Oh.

1806
01:23:53,339 --> 01:23:55,922
(gentle music)

1807
01:24:06,849 --> 01:24:07,682
Brittany.

1808
01:24:12,363 --> 01:24:13,723
Hi, Brit.

1809
01:24:13,723 --> 01:24:14,556
Hi.

1810
01:24:17,326 --> 01:24:18,159
- Oh!

1811
01:24:22,328 --> 01:24:23,161
- Yeah.

1812
01:24:25,654 --> 01:24:27,306
I got something for you.

1813
01:24:27,306 --> 01:24:28,473
I got Mr. Pig!

1814
01:24:33,772 --> 01:24:35,338
Come on Britt, come on.

1815
01:24:35,338 --> 01:24:36,571
Let's go home.

1816
01:24:36,571 --> 01:24:37,821
That's my girl.

1817
01:24:39,576 --> 01:24:42,125
(Brittany crying)

1818
01:24:42,125 --> 01:24:44,983
(whooshing) Here we go.

1819
01:24:44,983 --> 01:24:46,400
Up, Brittany, up!

1820
01:24:52,209 --> 01:24:54,977
I missed you so much.

1821
01:24:54,977 --> 01:24:57,977
(Brittany babbling)

1822
01:25:02,522 --> 01:25:03,689
Let's go home.

1823
01:25:06,256 --> 01:25:11,256
Let's get Mr. Pig and go yeah! (chuckling)

1824
01:25:16,458 --> 01:25:17,291
Come on.

1825
01:25:20,727 --> 01:25:21,788
Ready to go home?

1826
01:25:21,788 --> 01:25:23,863
You wanna go home?

1827
01:25:23,863 --> 01:25:25,030
Let's go home.

1828
01:25:30,126 --> 01:25:32,186

1829

1830
