1
00:00:10,501 --> 00:00:14,262
Harry Potter 3

2
00:00:29,189 --> 00:00:31,360
Lumos Maxima.

3
00:00:33,541 --> 00:00:36,192
Lumos Maxima.

4
00:00:55,461 --> 00:00:57,021
Lumos Maxima.

5
00:00:59,205 --> 00:01:01,027
Lumos Maxima.

6
00:01:02,917 --> 00:01:04,739
Lumos Maxima!

7
00:01:32,965 --> 00:01:34,459
Harry. Harry.

8
00:01:34,629 --> 00:01:36,539
Harry, open the door.

9
00:01:43,141 --> 00:01:45,377
Marge. How lovely to see...

10
00:01:45,541 --> 00:01:48,770
Uncle Vernon,
I need you to sign this form.

11
00:01:48,933 --> 00:01:50,210
What is it?

12
00:01:50,373 --> 00:01:52,413
Nothing. School stuff.

13
00:01:52,581 --> 00:01:55,134
Later perhaps, if you behave.

14
00:01:55,301 --> 00:01:57,406
I will if she does.

15
00:01:57,573 --> 00:02:00,607
- Oh, you're still here, are you?
- Yes.

16
00:02:00,965 --> 00:02:03,486
Don't say yes
in that ungrateful way.

17
00:02:03,653 --> 00:02:05,540
Damn good of my brother
to keep you.

18
00:02:05,701 --> 00:02:09,858
He'd have been straight to an orphanage
if he'd been dumped on my doorstep.

19
00:02:10,021 --> 00:02:14,211
Is that my Dudders?
Is that my little neffy-pooh?

20
00:02:14,373 --> 00:02:16,096
Give us a kiss. Come on. Up, up.

21
00:02:16,261 --> 00:02:18,432
Take Marge's suitcase upstairs.

22
00:02:18,597 --> 00:02:20,539
Okay.

23
00:02:23,749 --> 00:02:26,531
Finish that off for Mommy.
Good boy, Rippy-pooh.

24
00:02:27,493 --> 00:02:30,341
- Can I tempt you, Marge?
- Just a small one.

25
00:02:30,501 --> 00:02:33,316
Excellent nosh, Petunia.

26
00:02:33,893 --> 00:02:35,802
A bit more.

27
00:02:36,325 --> 00:02:39,554
Usually just a fry-up for me,
what with 12 dogs.

28
00:02:39,717 --> 00:02:42,205
Just a bit more. That's a boy.

29
00:02:45,157 --> 00:02:47,066
You wanna try
a little drop of brandy?

30
00:02:47,237 --> 00:02:51,099
A little drop of brandy-brandy
windy-wandy for Rippy-pippy-pooh?

31
00:02:52,549 --> 00:02:54,273
What are you smirking at?

32
00:02:54,437 --> 00:02:56,225
Where did you send the boy,
Vernon?

33
00:02:56,389 --> 00:02:59,553
St. Brutus'. It's a fine
institution for hopeless cases.

34
00:02:59,717 --> 00:03:02,619
Do they use a cane
at St. Brutus', boy?

35
00:03:05,925 --> 00:03:07,103
Oh, yeah.

36
00:03:07,269 --> 00:03:09,952
Yeah. I've been beaten
loads of times.

37
00:03:10,117 --> 00:03:12,605
Excellent. I won't have this
namby-pamby...

38
00:03:12,772 --> 00:03:15,806
...wishy-washy nonsense about
not beating people who deserve it.

39
00:03:15,973 --> 00:03:18,940
You mustn't blame yourself
about how this one turned out.

40
00:03:19,109 --> 00:03:22,884
It's all to do with blood.
Bad blood will out.

41
00:03:23,045 --> 00:03:25,117
What is it the boy's father did,
Petunia?

42
00:03:25,285 --> 00:03:28,154
Nothing. He didn't work.
He was unemployed.

43
00:03:28,325 --> 00:03:31,042
- And a drunk too, no doubt?
- That's a lie.

44
00:03:31,205 --> 00:03:33,660
- What did you say?
- My dad wasn't a drunk.

45
00:03:36,516 --> 00:03:40,445
Don't worry. Don't fuss, Petunia.
I have a very firm grip.

46
00:03:40,612 --> 00:03:42,368
I think it's time you went to bed.

47
00:03:42,532 --> 00:03:45,631
Quiet, Vernon. You, clean it up.

48
00:03:46,757 --> 00:03:49,659
Actually, it's nothing to do
with the father.

49
00:03:49,829 --> 00:03:53,626
It's all to do with the mother.
You see it all the time with dogs.

50
00:03:53,796 --> 00:03:57,691
If something's wrong with the bitch,
then something's wrong with the pup.

51
00:03:57,861 --> 00:03:59,486
Shut up! Shut up!

52
00:04:04,293 --> 00:04:05,951
Right.

53
00:04:06,117 --> 00:04:08,157
Let me tell you...

54
00:04:28,741 --> 00:04:30,781
Vernon!

55
00:04:33,668 --> 00:04:35,424
Vernon! Vernon, do something!

56
00:05:17,061 --> 00:05:19,003
Stop!

57
00:05:21,477 --> 00:05:23,932
I've got you, Marge.
I've got you.

58
00:05:27,205 --> 00:05:29,147
- Hold on, hold on.
- Get off.

59
00:05:30,341 --> 00:05:32,097
- Don't you dare!
- Sorry.

60
00:05:33,221 --> 00:05:34,977
Oh, Vernon.

61
00:05:35,141 --> 00:05:36,799
Oh, God.

62
00:05:36,965 --> 00:05:38,688
Marge!

63
00:05:45,477 --> 00:05:47,615
Please!

64
00:05:48,196 --> 00:05:50,301
Marge!

65
00:05:51,365 --> 00:05:54,398
Come back!

66
00:06:17,413 --> 00:06:19,714
You bring her back!
You bring her back now.

67
00:06:19,876 --> 00:06:23,008
- You put her right!
- No. She deserved what she got.

68
00:06:23,429 --> 00:06:26,429
- Keep away from me.
- You can't do magic outside school.

69
00:06:26,629 --> 00:06:29,498
- Yeah? Try me.
- They won't let you back now.

70
00:06:29,669 --> 00:06:30,946
You've nowhere to go.

71
00:06:31,109 --> 00:06:33,345
I don't care.
Anywhere is better than here.

72
00:08:05,572 --> 00:08:07,328
"Welcome to the Knight Bus...

73
00:08:07,492 --> 00:08:10,721
...emergency transport
for the stranded witch or wizard.

74
00:08:10,884 --> 00:08:15,641
My name is Stan Shunpike, and I will be
your conductor for this evening."

75
00:08:19,237 --> 00:08:20,611
What you doing down there?

76
00:08:21,317 --> 00:08:23,389
- I fell over.
- What you fell over for?

77
00:08:23,589 --> 00:08:26,109
- I didn't do it on purpose.
- Well, come on, then.

78
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:28,413
Let's not wait for the grass to grow.

79
00:08:35,236 --> 00:08:38,171
- What you looking at?
- Nothing.

80
00:08:38,341 --> 00:08:39,999
Well, come on, then. In.

81
00:08:40,165 --> 00:08:42,882
No, no, no. I'll get this. You get in.

82
00:08:47,653 --> 00:08:49,758
Come on.

83
00:08:59,236 --> 00:09:01,887
Come on. Move on, move on.

84
00:09:16,037 --> 00:09:19,168
- Take her away, Ern.
- Yeah, take it away, Ernie.

85
00:09:19,333 --> 00:09:21,472
It's going to be a bumpy ride.

86
00:09:31,749 --> 00:09:34,880
- What did you say your name was?
- I didn't.

87
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:39,355
- Whereabouts are you headed?
- The Leaky Cauldron. That's in London.

88
00:09:39,589 --> 00:09:42,404
You hear that? "The Leaky Cauldron.
That's in London."

89
00:09:42,565 --> 00:09:44,801
The Leaky Cauldron.
If you have pea soup...

90
00:09:44,964 --> 00:09:47,648
...make sure you eat it
before it eats you.

91
00:09:50,916 --> 00:09:53,436
- But the Muggles. Can't they see us?
- Muggles?

92
00:09:53,604 --> 00:09:55,262
They don't see nothing, do they?

93
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:57,883
No, but if you jab them
with a fork, they feel.

94
00:09:59,556 --> 00:10:02,491
Ernie, little old lady at 12 o'clock!

95
00:10:10,853 --> 00:10:13,274
Ten, nine, eight...

96
00:10:13,508 --> 00:10:16,094
...seven, six, five...

97
00:10:16,292 --> 00:10:18,431
...four, three, three and a half...

98
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:20,351
...two, one and three quarters.

99
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:22,427
Yes!

100
00:10:26,596 --> 00:10:27,938
Who is that?

101
00:10:28,132 --> 00:10:30,402
That man.

102
00:10:32,004 --> 00:10:33,728
Who is that?

103
00:10:33,924 --> 00:10:35,353
Who is...?

104
00:10:35,588 --> 00:10:37,857
That is Sirius Black, that is.

105
00:10:38,405 --> 00:10:41,536
Don't tell me you've never
been hearing of Sirius Black.

106
00:10:42,789 --> 00:10:44,960
He's a murderer.

107
00:10:45,125 --> 00:10:47,645
Got himself locked up
in Azkaban for it.

108
00:10:48,292 --> 00:10:51,554
- How did he escape?
- Well, that's the question, isn't it?

109
00:10:51,716 --> 00:10:53,604
He's the first one that done it.

110
00:10:54,532 --> 00:10:57,052
He was a big supporter of...

111
00:10:57,540 --> 00:10:58,969
...You-Know-Who.

112
00:10:59,652 --> 00:11:01,441
I reckon you've heard of him.

113
00:11:01,604 --> 00:11:03,131
Yeah.

114
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:04,577
Him I've heard of.

115
00:11:07,172 --> 00:11:09,725
Ernie, two double-deckers
at 12 o'clock.

116
00:11:10,212 --> 00:11:11,805
They're getting closer, Ernie.

117
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:14,719
Ernie, they're right on top of us!

118
00:11:21,797 --> 00:11:24,131
Mind your head.

119
00:11:28,804 --> 00:11:30,692
Hey, guys? Guys?

120
00:11:30,884 --> 00:11:32,957
Why the long faces?

121
00:11:38,564 --> 00:11:40,899
Yeah, yeah.
Nearly there. Nearly there.

122
00:11:46,116 --> 00:11:49,345
- The Leaky Cauldron.
- Next stop, Knockturn Alley.

123
00:11:50,628 --> 00:11:53,181
Mr. Potter, at last.

124
00:11:56,069 --> 00:11:58,687
- Take it away, Ern.
- Yeah, take it away, Ernie!

125
00:12:20,932 --> 00:12:22,688
Room 11.

126
00:12:25,156 --> 00:12:26,433
Hedwig.

127
00:12:26,596 --> 00:12:29,313
Right smart bird
you got there, Mr. Potter.

128
00:12:29,476 --> 00:12:33,022
He arrived here just
five minutes before yourself.

129
00:12:34,852 --> 00:12:38,333
As Minister for Magic, it is my duty
to inform you, Mr. Potter...

130
00:12:38,501 --> 00:12:41,567
...earlier this evening
your uncle's sister was located...

131
00:12:41,733 --> 00:12:45,529
...a little south of Sheffield,
circling a chimney stack.

132
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:49,278
The Accidental Magic Reversal
Department was dispatched immediately.

133
00:12:49,444 --> 00:12:54,049
She has been properly punctured
and her memory modified.

134
00:12:54,276 --> 00:12:58,749
She will have no recollection
of the incident whatsoever.

135
00:12:58,917 --> 00:13:01,404
So that's that...

136
00:13:01,572 --> 00:13:04,322
...and no harm done.

137
00:13:04,964 --> 00:13:06,241
Pea soup?

138
00:13:06,404 --> 00:13:08,444
No, thank you.

139
00:13:08,612 --> 00:13:10,718
- Minister?
- Yes?

140
00:13:10,884 --> 00:13:12,575
- I don't understand.
- Understand?

141
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:16,123
I broke the law. Underage wizards
can't use magic at home.

142
00:13:16,356 --> 00:13:19,225
Come now. The Ministry
doesn't send people to Azkaban...

143
00:13:19,396 --> 00:13:21,818
...for blowing up their aunts.

144
00:13:25,636 --> 00:13:29,979
On the other hand, running away
like that, given the state of things...

145
00:13:30,149 --> 00:13:32,516
...was very, very irresponsible.

146
00:13:32,708 --> 00:13:36,320
- "The state of things," sir?
- We have a killer on the loose.

147
00:13:36,484 --> 00:13:38,240
Sirius Black, you mean?

148
00:13:38,404 --> 00:13:40,095
But what's he got to do with me?

149
00:13:42,308 --> 00:13:46,913
Nothing, of course. You're safe.
And that's what matters.

150
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:50,107
And tomorrow you'll be
on your way back to Hogwarts.

151
00:13:50,276 --> 00:13:53,123
These are your new schoolbooks.
I took the liberty...

152
00:13:53,285 --> 00:13:57,114
...of having them brought here.
Now Tom will show you to your room.

153
00:14:01,829 --> 00:14:03,073
Hedwig.

154
00:14:03,332 --> 00:14:08,035
Oh, by the way, Harry. Whilst you're
here, it would be best if you didn't...

155
00:14:08,324 --> 00:14:10,691
...wander.

156
00:14:12,196 --> 00:14:14,978
Right! You gonna move
that bus or what?

157
00:15:30,532 --> 00:15:32,474
Housekeeping.

158
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:37,919
I'll come back later.

159
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:46,562
I'm warning you, Hermione.

160
00:15:46,724 --> 00:15:50,269
Keep that beast away from Scabbers,
or I'll turn it into a tea cozy.

161
00:15:50,468 --> 00:15:52,442
It's a cat, Ronald.
What do you expect?

162
00:15:52,612 --> 00:15:55,482
- It's in his nature.
- A cat? Is that what they told you?

163
00:15:55,652 --> 00:15:58,074
- Looks like a pig with hair.
- That's rich...

164
00:15:58,244 --> 00:16:00,665
...coming from the owner
of that smelly old shoe brush.

165
00:16:00,836 --> 00:16:03,225
Crookshanks, just ignore
the mean little boy.

166
00:16:03,396 --> 00:16:04,890
Harry.

167
00:16:05,924 --> 00:16:07,298
Harry.

168
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:11,355
- Egypt. What's it like?
- Brilliant. Loads of old stuff...

169
00:16:11,588 --> 00:16:14,752
...like mummies, tombs,
even Scabbers enjoyed himself.

170
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:18,013
- Egyptians used to worship cats.
- Along with the dung beetle.

171
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:21,214
- Not flashing that clipping again?
- I haven't shown anyone.

172
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:23,682
No, not a soul.
Not unless you count Tom.

173
00:16:23,844 --> 00:16:25,219
- The day maid.
- Night maid.

174
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:27,387
- Cook.
- The bloke who fixed the toilet.

175
00:16:27,556 --> 00:16:28,930
- Harry.
- Mrs. Weasley.

176
00:16:29,092 --> 00:16:31,165
- Good to see you, dear.
- Good to see you.

177
00:16:31,332 --> 00:16:32,609
- Got everything?
- Yes.

178
00:16:32,772 --> 00:16:34,844
- Yes? All your books?
- It's all upstairs.

179
00:16:35,012 --> 00:16:36,354
- Your clothes?
- Everything.

180
00:16:36,548 --> 00:16:37,725
- Good boy.
- Thank you.

181
00:16:37,892 --> 00:16:39,834
- Harry Potter.
- Mr. Weasley.

182
00:16:40,004 --> 00:16:43,353
- Harry, wonder if I might have a word?
- Yeah, sure.

183
00:16:43,556 --> 00:16:46,077
- Hermione.
- Good morning, Mr. Weasley.

184
00:16:46,244 --> 00:16:49,724
- Looking forward to a new term?
- Yeah. It should be great.

185
00:16:52,676 --> 00:16:56,353
Harry, some within the Ministry
would strongly discourage me...

186
00:16:56,516 --> 00:16:59,069
...from divulging what I'm about
to reveal to you.

187
00:16:59,236 --> 00:17:02,432
But I think that you need
to know the facts.

188
00:17:02,596 --> 00:17:05,084
You are in danger.

189
00:17:05,732 --> 00:17:08,099
Grave danger.

190
00:17:08,580 --> 00:17:11,100
Has this anything to do
with Sirius Black, sir?

191
00:17:11,876 --> 00:17:14,178
What do you know
about Sirius Black, Harry?

192
00:17:14,340 --> 00:17:17,885
- Only that he's escaped from Azkaban.
- Do you know why?

193
00:17:18,564 --> 00:17:21,248
Thirteen years ago,
when you stopped...

194
00:17:21,412 --> 00:17:23,168
- Voldemort.
- Don't say his name.

195
00:17:23,332 --> 00:17:24,608
Sorry.

196
00:17:24,772 --> 00:17:27,554
When you stopped You-Know-Who...

197
00:17:27,716 --> 00:17:29,277
...Black lost everything.

198
00:17:29,444 --> 00:17:33,567
But to this day, he still remains
a faithful servant.

199
00:17:33,732 --> 00:17:35,805
And in his mind...

200
00:17:35,972 --> 00:17:38,841
...you are the only thing
that stands in the way...

201
00:17:39,012 --> 00:17:42,590
...of You-Know-Who
returning to power.

202
00:17:42,788 --> 00:17:44,828
And that is why...

203
00:17:44,996 --> 00:17:47,451
...he has escaped from Azkaban.

204
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:49,406
To find you.

205
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:52,380
And kill me.

206
00:17:53,284 --> 00:17:55,837
Harry, swear to me
that whatever you might hear...

207
00:17:56,004 --> 00:17:58,426
...you won't go looking for Black.

208
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:00,096
Mr. Weasley...

209
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:04,090
...why would I go looking
for someone who wants to kill me?

210
00:18:04,836 --> 00:18:06,527
Quick. Quick.

211
00:18:06,692 --> 00:18:08,448
Ron, Ron!

212
00:18:09,124 --> 00:18:11,131
Oh, for goodness' sake!

213
00:18:11,332 --> 00:18:13,698
Don't lose him!

214
00:18:14,692 --> 00:18:16,667
I didn't mean to blow her up. I just...

215
00:18:16,868 --> 00:18:19,202
- I lost control.
- Brilliant.

216
00:18:19,364 --> 00:18:22,811
Honestly, Ron, it's not funny.
Harry was lucky not to be expelled.

217
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:24,638
I was lucky not to be arrested.

218
00:18:24,804 --> 00:18:26,746
I still think it was brilliant.

219
00:18:27,332 --> 00:18:29,569
Come on. Everywhere else is full.

220
00:18:32,292 --> 00:18:33,601
Who do you think that is?

221
00:18:33,763 --> 00:18:36,513
- Professor R.J. Lupin.
- Do you know everything?

222
00:18:36,676 --> 00:18:38,716
How is it she knows everything?

223
00:18:38,884 --> 00:18:41,884
- It's on his suitcase, Ronald.
- Oh.

224
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:45,311
- Do you think he's really asleep?
- Seems to be. Why?

225
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:49,020
I gotta tell you something.

226
00:19:01,924 --> 00:19:05,022
Let me get this straight.
Sirius Black escaped from Azkaban...

227
00:19:05,188 --> 00:19:07,043
...to come after you?
- Yeah.

228
00:19:07,204 --> 00:19:09,026
But they'll catch Black, won't they?

229
00:19:09,188 --> 00:19:11,871
- I mean, everyone's looking for him.
- Sure.

230
00:19:12,036 --> 00:19:15,232
Except no one's ever broken out
of Azkaban before...

231
00:19:15,395 --> 00:19:19,072
...and he's a murderous, raving lunatic.
- Thanks, Ron.

232
00:19:20,484 --> 00:19:22,011
Why are we stopping?

233
00:19:23,044 --> 00:19:24,702
We can't be there yet.

234
00:19:28,739 --> 00:19:30,911
What's going on?

235
00:19:31,108 --> 00:19:33,661
I don't know.
Maybe we've broken down.

236
00:19:35,524 --> 00:19:37,760
Ouch, Ron. That was my foot.

237
00:19:38,596 --> 00:19:40,450
There's something moving out there.

238
00:19:53,476 --> 00:19:56,378
I think someone's coming aboard.

239
00:20:20,548 --> 00:20:23,297
Bloody hell! What's happening?

240
00:21:32,483 --> 00:21:33,825
Harry.

241
00:21:34,884 --> 00:21:36,640
Harry, are you all right?

242
00:21:42,564 --> 00:21:44,157
Thank you.

243
00:21:45,284 --> 00:21:47,618
Here, eat this. It'll help.

244
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:50,139
It's all right. It's chocolate.

245
00:21:56,196 --> 00:21:58,170
What was that thing that came?

246
00:21:58,340 --> 00:22:01,635
It was a dementor. One of the guards
of Azkaban. It's gone now.

247
00:22:01,796 --> 00:22:04,381
It was searching the train
for Sirius Black.

248
00:22:04,548 --> 00:22:08,028
If you'll excuse me, I need to have
a little word with the driver.

249
00:22:12,451 --> 00:22:15,234
Eat. You'll feel better.

250
00:22:20,804 --> 00:22:22,080
What happened to me?

251
00:22:22,243 --> 00:22:23,901
Well, you sort of went rigid.

252
00:22:24,067 --> 00:22:27,101
We thought maybe you were
having a fit or something.

253
00:22:28,804 --> 00:22:30,495
And did either of you two...

254
00:22:30,691 --> 00:22:31,935
...you know...

255
00:22:32,132 --> 00:22:35,067
...pass out?
- No.

256
00:22:35,235 --> 00:22:36,861
I felt weird, though.

257
00:22:37,028 --> 00:22:38,784
Like I'd never be cheerful again.

258
00:22:40,004 --> 00:22:42,109
But someone was screaming.

259
00:22:42,276 --> 00:22:43,585
A woman.

260
00:22:44,516 --> 00:22:46,425
No one was screaming, Harry.

261
00:23:43,204 --> 00:23:46,946
Welcome! Welcome to another year
at Hogwarts.

262
00:23:47,108 --> 00:23:49,050
Now, I'd like to say a few words...

263
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:53,376
...before we all become too befuddled
by our excellent feast.

264
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:56,704
First, I'm pleased to welcome
Professor R.J. Lupin...

265
00:23:56,868 --> 00:23:59,202
...who's kindly consented
to fill the post...

266
00:23:59,396 --> 00:24:01,763
...of Defense Against
the Dark Arts teacher.

267
00:24:01,924 --> 00:24:04,346
Good luck, professor.

268
00:24:08,772 --> 00:24:11,968
Of course. That's why he knew
to give you the chocolate, Harry.

269
00:24:12,132 --> 00:24:14,685
Potter. Is it true you fainted?

270
00:24:15,491 --> 00:24:18,361
- I mean, you actually fainted?
- Shove off, Malfoy.

271
00:24:18,532 --> 00:24:20,441
- How did he find out?
- Just forget it.

272
00:24:20,612 --> 00:24:22,881
Our Care of Magical Creatures
teacher...

273
00:24:23,076 --> 00:24:24,864
...has decided to retire...

274
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:28,638
...in order to spend more time
with his remaining limbs.

275
00:24:28,836 --> 00:24:31,421
Fortunately,
I'm delighted to announce...

276
00:24:31,588 --> 00:24:34,305
...that his place will be taken
by none other...

277
00:24:34,468 --> 00:24:38,625
...than our own Rubeus Hagrid.

278
00:24:49,443 --> 00:24:52,127
Finally, on a more disquieting note...

279
00:24:52,323 --> 00:24:54,712
...at the request
of the Ministry of Magic...

280
00:24:54,916 --> 00:24:59,869
...Hogwarts will, until further notice,
play host to the dementors of Azkaban...

281
00:25:00,516 --> 00:25:03,832
...until such a time
as Sirius Black is captured.

282
00:25:04,772 --> 00:25:08,285
The dementors will be stationed
at every entrance to the grounds.

283
00:25:08,452 --> 00:25:10,045
Now whilst I've been assured...

284
00:25:10,211 --> 00:25:13,724
...that their presence will not disrupt
our day-to-day activities...

285
00:25:13,891 --> 00:25:15,168
...a word of caution.

286
00:25:15,363 --> 00:25:18,397
Dementors are vicious creatures.
They'll not distinguish...

287
00:25:18,564 --> 00:25:21,825
...between the one they hunt
and the one who gets in their way.

288
00:25:21,987 --> 00:25:25,468
Therefore, I must warn
each and every one of you...

289
00:25:25,636 --> 00:25:29,116
...to give them no reason
to harm you.

290
00:25:29,859 --> 00:25:34,748
It is not in the nature
of a dementor to be forgiving.

291
00:25:36,804 --> 00:25:39,968
But you know,
happiness can be found...

292
00:25:40,132 --> 00:25:43,579
...even in the darkest of times...

293
00:25:44,771 --> 00:25:48,481
...if one only remembers
to turn on the light.

294
00:26:00,004 --> 00:26:01,913
Fortuna Major.

295
00:26:04,644 --> 00:26:07,197
Here, listen.
She just won't let me in.

296
00:26:07,395 --> 00:26:10,210
- Fortuna Major.
- No, no. Wait, wait.

297
00:26:10,371 --> 00:26:12,127
Watch this.

298
00:26:22,436 --> 00:26:27,193
- Amazing. Just with my voice.
- Fortuna Major.

299
00:26:27,395 --> 00:26:30,810
- Yes, all right. Go in.
- Thank you.

300
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:34,627
Still doing that after three years.

301
00:26:34,787 --> 00:26:36,860
- She can't even sing.
- Exactly.

302
00:26:38,052 --> 00:26:40,124
- Hey, man.
- Hey, man.

303
00:26:41,124 --> 00:26:42,433
- Oh, God.
- That's awful.

304
00:26:43,363 --> 00:26:45,435
Green. That's a monkey.

305
00:26:47,171 --> 00:26:49,724
- What is that?
- You call that a monkey?

306
00:26:49,891 --> 00:26:51,996
Do not give him one again.

307
00:26:52,163 --> 00:26:54,684
Hey, Neville, try an elephant.

308
00:27:01,475 --> 00:27:03,166
- Ron, catch.
- I will.

309
00:27:08,612 --> 00:27:10,172
I think we have a winner.

310
00:27:11,075 --> 00:27:13,312
- Oh, don't try one of them.
- Oh, no.

311
00:27:13,924 --> 00:27:16,313
Look at him. His face.

312
00:27:58,180 --> 00:28:00,318
Welcome, my children.

313
00:28:00,515 --> 00:28:05,403
In this room, you shall explore
the noble art of Divination.

314
00:28:05,571 --> 00:28:10,656
In this room, you shall discover
if you possess the Sight.

315
00:28:12,003 --> 00:28:15,800
Hello. I am Professor Trelawney.

316
00:28:15,972 --> 00:28:20,379
Together we shall cast ourselves
into the future.

317
00:28:20,612 --> 00:28:24,289
This term, we'll focus on Tasseomancy,
the art of reading tea leaves.

318
00:28:24,452 --> 00:28:27,867
So please, take the cup
of the person sitting opposite you.

319
00:28:28,355 --> 00:28:29,664
What do you see?

320
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:35,261
The truth lies buried like a sentence
deep within a book, waiting to be read.

321
00:28:35,491 --> 00:28:37,793
But first, you must broaden
your minds.

322
00:28:37,955 --> 00:28:42,297
- First, you must look beyond.
- What a load of rubbish.

323
00:28:42,467 --> 00:28:44,322
- Where did you come from?
- Me?

324
00:28:44,483 --> 00:28:47,036
- I've been here all this time.
- You, boy...

325
00:28:47,203 --> 00:28:49,407
Is your grandmother quite well?

326
00:28:50,051 --> 00:28:51,426
I think so.

327
00:28:51,588 --> 00:28:54,271
I wouldn't be so sure of that.
Give me the cup.

328
00:28:57,155 --> 00:28:58,464
Pity.

329
00:28:58,691 --> 00:29:01,179
Broaden your minds.

330
00:29:04,643 --> 00:29:07,839
Your aura is pulsing, dear.
Are you in the beyond?

331
00:29:08,003 --> 00:29:09,826
- I think you are.
- Sure.

332
00:29:10,051 --> 00:29:12,156
Look at the cup.
Tell me what you see.

333
00:29:12,323 --> 00:29:13,949
Yeah.

334
00:29:14,755 --> 00:29:19,010
Harry's got sort of a wonky cross.
That's trials and suffering.

335
00:29:19,428 --> 00:29:22,908
And that there could be the sun
and that's happiness.

336
00:29:23,139 --> 00:29:24,383
So...

337
00:29:24,580 --> 00:29:28,442
...you're gonna suffer,
but you're gonna be happy about it.

338
00:29:28,643 --> 00:29:29,919
Give me the cup.

339
00:29:32,387 --> 00:29:34,209
Oh, my dear boy.

340
00:29:36,195 --> 00:29:37,788
My dear...

341
00:29:39,395 --> 00:29:42,362
...you have the Grim.

342
00:29:43,171 --> 00:29:44,830
The Grin? What's the Grin?

343
00:29:44,996 --> 00:29:47,745
Not the Grin, you idiot. The Grim.

344
00:29:47,907 --> 00:29:50,012
"Taking form of a giant spectral dog.

345
00:29:50,211 --> 00:29:52,545
It's among the darkest omens
in our world.

346
00:29:53,091 --> 00:29:54,684
It's an omen...

347
00:29:54,852 --> 00:29:56,608
...of death."

348
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:04,638
You don't think that Grim thing's
got anything to do with Sirius Black?

349
00:30:04,804 --> 00:30:08,546
Oh, honestly, Ron. If you ask me,
Divination's a woolly discipline.

350
00:30:08,739 --> 00:30:12,220
Now, Ancient Runes,
that's a fascinating subject.

351
00:30:12,388 --> 00:30:15,388
Ancient Runes? Exactly how many
classes are you taking?

352
00:30:15,555 --> 00:30:17,148
A fair few.

353
00:30:17,315 --> 00:30:19,323
Hang on. That's not possible.

354
00:30:19,491 --> 00:30:22,142
Ancient Runes is in the
same time as Divination.

355
00:30:22,307 --> 00:30:24,216
You have to be in two
classes at once.

356
00:30:24,387 --> 00:30:27,649
Don't be silly. How could anyone
be in two classes at once?

357
00:30:27,811 --> 00:30:31,870
"Broaden your minds. Use your
Inner Eye to see the future."

358
00:30:32,996 --> 00:30:36,792
That's it. Come on, now. Come closer.
Less talking, if you don't mind.

359
00:30:36,963 --> 00:30:38,719
I got a real treat for you today.

360
00:30:38,883 --> 00:30:40,793
A great lesson. So follow me.

361
00:30:51,587 --> 00:30:54,555
Right, you lot. Less chattering.
Form a group over there.

362
00:30:54,724 --> 00:30:57,113
And open your books to page 49.

363
00:30:57,283 --> 00:30:58,844
Exactly how do we do that?

364
00:30:59,043 --> 00:31:02,753
Just stroke the spine, of course.
Goodness me.

365
00:31:11,747 --> 00:31:15,392
- Don't be such a wimp, Longbottom.
- I'm okay. Okay.

366
00:31:18,915 --> 00:31:21,981
- I think they're funny.
- Oh, yeah. Terribly funny.

367
00:31:22,212 --> 00:31:24,578
Witty. God, this place
has gone to the dogs.

368
00:31:24,771 --> 00:31:28,284
Wait until Father hears Dumbledore's
got this oaf teaching classes.

369
00:31:29,188 --> 00:31:30,464
Shut up, Malfoy.

370
00:31:44,387 --> 00:31:46,362
Dementor! Dementor!

371
00:31:54,019 --> 00:31:56,986
- Just ignore him.
- You're supposed to stroke it.

372
00:31:57,155 --> 00:31:58,562
Yeah.

373
00:32:08,355 --> 00:32:11,224
Isn't he beautiful?

374
00:32:11,395 --> 00:32:13,915
Say hello to Buckbeak.

375
00:32:14,499 --> 00:32:16,638
Hagrid, exactly what is that?

376
00:32:16,835 --> 00:32:18,777
That, Ron, is a hippogriff.

377
00:32:18,947 --> 00:32:22,296
First thing you wanna know
is they're very proud creatures.

378
00:32:22,531 --> 00:32:26,241
Very easily offended.
You do not want to insult a hippogriff.

379
00:32:26,403 --> 00:32:29,021
It may be the last thing you ever do.

380
00:32:29,187 --> 00:32:32,449
Now, who'd like to come
and say hello?

381
00:32:34,883 --> 00:32:36,857
Well done, Harry. Well done.

382
00:32:39,555 --> 00:32:40,897
Come on now.

383
00:32:41,411 --> 00:32:42,687
Now...

384
00:32:42,883 --> 00:32:46,429
...you have to let him make the first
move. It's only polite. So...

385
00:32:46,595 --> 00:32:48,383
...step up. Give him a nice bow.

386
00:32:48,611 --> 00:32:50,913
Then you wait
and see if he bows back.

387
00:32:51,075 --> 00:32:53,115
If he does, you can go and touch him.

388
00:32:53,283 --> 00:32:56,349
If not... Well,
we'll get to that later.

389
00:32:58,915 --> 00:33:00,857
Just make your bow.

390
00:33:02,403 --> 00:33:03,996
Nice and low.

391
00:33:09,123 --> 00:33:10,716
Back off, Harry. Back off.

392
00:33:12,515 --> 00:33:13,944
Keep still.

393
00:33:15,555 --> 00:33:17,464
Keep still.

394
00:33:25,315 --> 00:33:29,570
Well done, Harry. Well done.
Here, you big brute, you.

395
00:33:31,971 --> 00:33:34,392
Right. I think you can go
and pat him now.

396
00:33:34,595 --> 00:33:36,351
Go on. Don't be shy.

397
00:33:44,451 --> 00:33:46,785
Nice and slow, now.
Nice and slow. Slow.

398
00:33:50,019 --> 00:33:51,360
Not so fast, Harry.

399
00:33:56,259 --> 00:33:59,358
Slow down, Harry. That's it...

400
00:33:59,555 --> 00:34:02,588
Nice and slow.
Now let him come to you.

401
00:34:04,419 --> 00:34:06,623
Slowly, now, slowly, slowly...

402
00:34:06,851 --> 00:34:08,542
That's it...

403
00:34:09,155 --> 00:34:10,431
Yes!

404
00:34:11,011 --> 00:34:14,273
Well done! Well done, Harry,
well done!

405
00:34:14,435 --> 00:34:16,344
Does he get to fly?

406
00:34:16,547 --> 00:34:18,848
- I think he may let you ride him now.
- What?

407
00:34:19,043 --> 00:34:20,505
- Come on.
- Hey, hey, hey!

408
00:34:20,675 --> 00:34:23,708
Put you over here,
just behind the wing joint.

409
00:34:24,355 --> 00:34:28,545
Don't pull out any of his feathers,
because he won't thank you for that.

410
00:36:05,379 --> 00:36:08,728
Well done, Harry, and well done,
Buckbeak.

411
00:36:08,931 --> 00:36:10,753
That was wicked, Harry!

412
00:36:10,947 --> 00:36:12,289
Oh, please.

413
00:36:13,059 --> 00:36:15,263
Well done, well done.

414
00:36:15,939 --> 00:36:19,005
- How am I doing me first day?
- Brilliant, professor.

415
00:36:22,275 --> 00:36:26,301
You're not dangerous at all, are you,
you great ugly brute!

416
00:36:26,531 --> 00:36:27,840
Malfoy, no...

417
00:36:28,707 --> 00:36:30,114
No!

418
00:36:30,819 --> 00:36:32,346
Buckbeak!

419
00:36:32,547 --> 00:36:34,587
Whoa, whoa, whoa...

420
00:36:35,715 --> 00:36:37,438
Whoa! Buckbeak!

421
00:36:38,531 --> 00:36:40,767
Away, you silly creature...

422
00:36:40,963 --> 00:36:43,898
- It's killed me!
- Calm down. It's just a scratch!

423
00:36:44,131 --> 00:36:45,276
Hagrid!

424
00:36:45,443 --> 00:36:50,429
- He has to be taken to the hospital.
- I'm the teacher. I'll do it.

425
00:36:53,379 --> 00:36:56,128
- You're gonna regret this.
- Class dismissed!

426
00:36:56,291 --> 00:36:58,462
You and your bloody chicken!

427
00:37:20,995 --> 00:37:22,937
Does it hurt terribly, Draco?

428
00:37:23,171 --> 00:37:26,848
It comes and it goes.
Still, I consider myself lucky.

429
00:37:27,011 --> 00:37:30,208
Madam Pomfrey said another minute
and I could've lost my arm.

430
00:37:30,531 --> 00:37:33,280
- I can't do homework for weeks.
- Listen to the idiot.

431
00:37:33,507 --> 00:37:37,598
- He's really laying it on thick, isn't he?
- At least Hagrid didn't get fired.

432
00:37:37,795 --> 00:37:41,373
I hear Draco's father's furious.
We haven't heard the end of this.

433
00:37:41,570 --> 00:37:43,326
- He's been sighted!
- Who?

434
00:37:43,523 --> 00:37:45,149
Sirius Black!

435
00:37:46,179 --> 00:37:49,048
Dufftown? That's not far from here.

436
00:37:49,443 --> 00:37:51,963
You don't think he'd come
to Hogwarts, do you?

437
00:37:52,130 --> 00:37:54,519
- With dementors at every entrance?
- Dementors?

438
00:37:54,691 --> 00:37:57,887
He slipped past them once.
Who's to say he won't do it again?

439
00:37:58,083 --> 00:38:02,426
That's right. Black could be anywhere.
It's like trying to catch smoke.

440
00:38:03,202 --> 00:38:06,236
Like trying to catch smoke
with your bare hands.

441
00:38:31,299 --> 00:38:33,273
Intriguing, isn't it?

442
00:38:36,387 --> 00:38:39,038
Would anyone like to venture
a guess...

443
00:38:39,203 --> 00:38:40,926
...as to what is inside?

444
00:38:41,123 --> 00:38:44,952
- That's a boggart, that is.
- Very good, Mr. Thomas.

445
00:38:45,699 --> 00:38:48,481
Now, can anybody tell me
what a boggart looks like?

446
00:38:48,674 --> 00:38:50,616
- No one knows.
- When did she get here?

447
00:38:50,850 --> 00:38:52,279
Boggarts are shape-shifters.

448
00:38:52,483 --> 00:38:55,549
They take the shape of whatever
a person fears the most.

449
00:38:55,779 --> 00:39:00,002
- That's what makes them so...
- So terrifying, yes, yes, yes...

450
00:39:00,194 --> 00:39:05,432
Luckily, a very simple charm exists
to repel a boggart.

451
00:39:06,754 --> 00:39:10,366
Let's practice it now.
Without wands, please.

452
00:39:10,658 --> 00:39:13,047
After me. Riddikulus!

453
00:39:13,251 --> 00:39:15,258
- Riddikulus!
- Very good.

454
00:39:15,491 --> 00:39:17,880
A little louder and very clear.
00:39:18,332... > 00:39:20,437
- Riddikulus!
- Riddikulus!

455
00:39:20,387 --> 00:39:22,394
- This class is ridiculous.
- Very good.

456
00:39:22,595 --> 00:39:26,424
So much for the easy part. You see,
the incantation alone is not enough.

457
00:39:26,626 --> 00:39:30,205
What really finishes a boggart
is laughter.

458
00:39:30,402 --> 00:39:34,625
You need to force it to assume
a shape you find truly amusing.

459
00:39:34,787 --> 00:39:38,748
Let me explain. Neville,
would you join me, please?

460
00:39:38,979 --> 00:39:41,183
Come on, don't be shy. Come on.

461
00:39:42,147 --> 00:39:43,772
Come on.

462
00:39:44,194 --> 00:39:47,543
Hello. Neville, what frightens you
most of all?

463
00:39:47,746 --> 00:39:49,339
Professor Snape.

464
00:39:49,571 --> 00:39:51,327
- Sorry?
- Professor Snape.

465
00:39:51,491 --> 00:39:54,752
Professor Snape. Yes, frightens all.

466
00:39:54,914 --> 00:39:59,224
- You live with your grandmother.
- I don't want it to turn into her, either.

467
00:39:59,714 --> 00:40:01,241
No...

468
00:40:02,051 --> 00:40:04,701
...it won't. I want you
to picture her clothes.

469
00:40:04,962 --> 00:40:08,028
Only her clothes, very clearly,
in your mind.

470
00:40:08,258 --> 00:40:11,193
- She carries a red handbag...
- We don't need to hear.

471
00:40:11,363 --> 00:40:15,072
As long as you see it, we'll see it.
Now, when I open that wardrobe...

472
00:40:15,267 --> 00:40:18,431
...here's what I want
you to do. Excuse me.

473
00:40:18,883 --> 00:40:21,697
Imagine Professor Snape
in your grandmother's clothes.

474
00:40:21,890 --> 00:40:23,516
Can you do that?

475
00:40:24,099 --> 00:40:26,684
Yes. Wand at the ready.

476
00:40:27,011 --> 00:40:30,359
One, two, three.

477
00:40:39,747 --> 00:40:41,569
Think, Neville, think.

478
00:40:44,195 --> 00:40:46,169
Riddikulus!

479
00:40:50,531 --> 00:40:53,084
Wonderful, Neville, wonderful!
Incredible! Okay...

480
00:40:53,282 --> 00:40:56,065
...to the back, Neville.
Everyone, form a line...

481
00:41:02,051 --> 00:41:03,327
Form a line!

482
00:41:03,490 --> 00:41:06,752
I want everyone to picture the thing
they fear the very most...

483
00:41:06,947 --> 00:41:09,914
...and turn it into something funny.

484
00:41:10,115 --> 00:41:11,740
Next! Ron!

485
00:41:14,850 --> 00:41:18,233
Concentrate. Face your fear.
Be brave!

486
00:41:29,250 --> 00:41:30,712
Wand at the ready, Ron.

487
00:41:31,426 --> 00:41:33,182
Riddikulus!

488
00:41:33,346 --> 00:41:34,655
Yes!

489
00:41:35,235 --> 00:41:38,017
You see? Very good, very good!

490
00:41:38,498 --> 00:41:44,063
Marvelous! Absolutely, very, very
enjoyable! Parvati! Next!

491
00:41:45,795 --> 00:41:47,900
Show us what you see.

492
00:41:56,803 --> 00:42:00,064
Keep your nerve. Steady.

493
00:42:00,226 --> 00:42:02,114
Riddikulus!

494
00:42:03,106 --> 00:42:04,994
And next! Step up, step up!

495
00:42:06,051 --> 00:42:07,807
Wonderful, wonderful!

496
00:42:21,250 --> 00:42:23,258
Here!

497
00:42:28,899 --> 00:42:30,622
Riddikulus!

498
00:42:38,786 --> 00:42:41,601
Right. Sorry about that.
That's enough for today.

499
00:42:41,762 --> 00:42:43,672
Collect your books from the back.

500
00:42:43,843 --> 00:42:46,363
That's the end of the lesson.
Thank you! Sorry!

501
00:42:46,531 --> 00:42:49,433
Sorry, you can have too much
of a good thing.

502
00:42:51,362 --> 00:42:55,770
Remember, these visits to Hogsmeade
village are a privilege.

503
00:42:56,035 --> 00:42:58,752
Should your behavior reflect poorly
on the school...

504
00:42:58,915 --> 00:43:01,730
...that privilege shall not
be extended again.

505
00:43:02,147 --> 00:43:05,311
No permission form signed,
no visiting the village.

506
00:43:05,475 --> 00:43:06,936
That's the rule, Potter.

507
00:43:07,170 --> 00:43:10,236
Those with permission, follow me.
Those without, stay put.

508
00:43:10,402 --> 00:43:12,791
I thought if you signed it,
then I could...

509
00:43:12,963 --> 00:43:15,352
I can't. Only a parent
or a guardian can sign.

510
00:43:15,522 --> 00:43:18,589
Since I am neither,
it would be inappropriate.

511
00:43:20,802 --> 00:43:25,177
I'm sorry, Potter.
That's my final word.

512
00:43:26,370 --> 00:43:29,469
Forget about it, guys. See you later.

513
00:43:42,723 --> 00:43:44,665
Professor, can I ask you something?

514
00:43:44,866 --> 00:43:48,576
You want to know why I stopped you
facing that boggart, yes?

515
00:43:48,770 --> 00:43:50,112
I thought it'd be obvious.

516
00:43:50,274 --> 00:43:52,991
I assumed it would take the shape
of Lord Voldemort.

517
00:43:53,154 --> 00:43:56,503
I did think of Voldemort at first.

518
00:43:56,738 --> 00:43:59,226
But then I remembered that night
on the train...

519
00:43:59,395 --> 00:44:01,816
...and the dementor.
- I'm very impressed.

520
00:44:02,019 --> 00:44:04,768
That suggests what you fear the most
is fear itself.

521
00:44:04,930 --> 00:44:06,359
This is very wise.

522
00:44:06,530 --> 00:44:08,505
Before I fainted...

523
00:44:08,770 --> 00:44:10,680
...I heard something.

524
00:44:11,202 --> 00:44:12,763
A woman...

525
00:44:13,187 --> 00:44:14,496
...screaming.

526
00:44:14,690 --> 00:44:17,789
Dementors force us to relive
our very worst memories.

527
00:44:17,987 --> 00:44:20,801
Our pain becomes their power.

528
00:44:21,602 --> 00:44:23,707
I think it was my mother...

529
00:44:23,874 --> 00:44:26,013
...the night she was murdered.

530
00:44:27,554 --> 00:44:31,831
The very first time I saw you, Harry,
I recognized you immediately.

531
00:44:32,387 --> 00:44:35,136
Not by your scar, by your eyes.

532
00:44:35,523 --> 00:44:37,595
They're your mother, Lily's.

533
00:44:38,499 --> 00:44:39,873
Yes.

534
00:44:40,194 --> 00:44:43,064
Oh, yes. I knew her.

535
00:44:45,315 --> 00:44:48,991
Your mother was there for me
at a time when no one else was.

536
00:44:49,186 --> 00:44:52,285
Not only was she
a singularly gifted witch...

537
00:44:52,451 --> 00:44:55,647
...she was also
an uncommonly kind woman.

538
00:44:56,131 --> 00:44:59,065
She had a way of seeing
the beauty in others...

539
00:44:59,234 --> 00:45:05,147
...even, and most especially, when that
person could not see it in themselves.

540
00:45:06,562 --> 00:45:09,148
And your father, James,
on the other hand...

541
00:45:09,315 --> 00:45:10,776
...he...

542
00:45:11,266 --> 00:45:14,495
He had a certain, shall we say,
talent for trouble.

543
00:45:16,674 --> 00:45:21,944
A talent, rumor has it,
he passed on to you.

544
00:45:25,795 --> 00:45:28,642
You're more like them
than you know, Harry.

545
00:45:29,442 --> 00:45:32,442
In time, you'll come to see
just how much.

546
00:45:35,747 --> 00:45:39,969
Honeyduke's Sweetshop is brilliant,
but nothing beats Zonko's Joke Shop.

547
00:45:40,162 --> 00:45:42,584
We never got to go
to the Shrieking Shack.

548
00:45:42,754 --> 00:45:46,649
- You heard it's the most...
- Haunted building in Britain. I know.

549
00:45:47,971 --> 00:45:49,399
What's going on?

550
00:45:49,570 --> 00:45:51,905
Probably Neville forgot
the password again.

551
00:45:52,067 --> 00:45:54,401
- Hey.
- Oh, you're there.

552
00:45:54,562 --> 00:45:58,686
Let me through, please.
Excuse me! I'm Head Boy!

553
00:46:00,226 --> 00:46:01,819
Get back, all of you.

554
00:46:02,019 --> 00:46:05,018
No one is to enter this dormitory
until it's been searched.

555
00:46:05,186 --> 00:46:06,463
The Fat Lady! She's gone!

556
00:46:08,482 --> 00:46:10,849
Serves her right.
She was a terrible singer.

557
00:46:11,011 --> 00:46:12,833
It's not funny, Ron.

558
00:46:14,755 --> 00:46:18,683
Keep calm, everyone. Break into fours.
Back to your common room.

559
00:46:24,770 --> 00:46:25,718
- Be quiet.
- Make way.

560
00:46:25,890 --> 00:46:27,865
- The headmaster's here.
- Come on, move.

561
00:46:28,034 --> 00:46:29,857
You heard. Move!

562
00:46:43,490 --> 00:46:46,240
Mr. Filch? Round up the ghosts.

563
00:46:46,562 --> 00:46:50,490
Tell them to search every painting
in the castle to find the Fat Lady.

564
00:46:50,690 --> 00:46:53,624
There's no need for ghosts, professor.

565
00:46:54,434 --> 00:46:56,474
The Fat Lady's there.

566
00:46:57,282 --> 00:46:59,192
Mind where you're going! Slow down!

567
00:46:59,746 --> 00:47:02,299
You listen! I'm Head Boy!

568
00:47:02,498 --> 00:47:04,800
- Come back here!
- Keep moving!

569
00:47:08,258 --> 00:47:11,008
Dear lady, who did this to you?

570
00:47:12,834 --> 00:47:17,656
Eyes like the devil, he's got,
and a soul as dark as his name.

571
00:47:18,562 --> 00:47:21,432
It's him, headmaster.
The one they all talk about.

572
00:47:21,603 --> 00:47:23,969
He's here, somewhere in the castle!

573
00:47:24,194 --> 00:47:26,266
Sirius Black!

574
00:47:26,498 --> 00:47:31,387
Secure the castle, Mr. Filch.
The rest of you, to the Great Hall.

575
00:47:58,306 --> 00:48:03,041
I've searched the Astronomy Tower
and the Owlery. There's nothing there.

576
00:48:03,202 --> 00:48:05,657
- Thank you.
- The third floor's clear too, sir.

577
00:48:05,858 --> 00:48:07,713
- Very good.
- I've done the dungeons.

578
00:48:07,874 --> 00:48:10,427
No sign of Black, nor anywhere else
in the castle.

579
00:48:10,658 --> 00:48:13,047
I didn't really expect him to linger.

580
00:48:14,242 --> 00:48:16,479
Remarkable feat, don't you think?

581
00:48:16,642 --> 00:48:18,846
To enter Hogwarts Castle
on one's own...

582
00:48:19,010 --> 00:48:21,563
...completely undetected?
- Quite remarkable, yes.

583
00:48:21,762 --> 00:48:23,518
Any theories on how
he managed it?

584
00:48:23,714 --> 00:48:26,561
Many. Each as unlikely as the next.

585
00:48:26,787 --> 00:48:28,281
You may recall...

586
00:48:28,451 --> 00:48:31,167
...prior to the start of term
I expressed concerns...

587
00:48:31,331 --> 00:48:33,305
...about your appointment
of Professor...

588
00:48:33,474 --> 00:48:37,402
Not a single professor inside this castle
would help Sirius Black enter it.

589
00:48:37,570 --> 00:48:39,872
I'm quite convinced the castle is safe...

590
00:48:40,034 --> 00:48:43,514
...and I'm more than willing to send
the students to their houses.

591
00:48:43,682 --> 00:48:45,918
What about Potter?
Should he be warned?

592
00:48:46,114 --> 00:48:48,634
Perhaps. But for now, let him sleep.

593
00:48:49,474 --> 00:48:53,980
For in dreams, we enter a world
that's entirely our own.

594
00:48:54,274 --> 00:49:00,504
Let them swim in the deepest ocean
or glide over the highest cloud.

595
00:49:36,322 --> 00:49:39,518
Turn to page 394.

596
00:49:48,578 --> 00:49:51,993
Excuse me, sir.
Where's Professor Lupin?

597
00:49:52,674 --> 00:49:55,970
That's not really your concern,
is it, Potter?

598
00:49:56,130 --> 00:49:59,839
Suffice it to say your professor
finds himself incapable of teaching...

599
00:50:00,034 --> 00:50:04,890
...at the present time.
Turn to page 394.

600
00:50:09,506 --> 00:50:11,132
"Werewolves"?

601
00:50:11,426 --> 00:50:14,077
Sir, we just learned about red caps
and hinkypunks.

602
00:50:14,306 --> 00:50:17,306
- We're not meant to start that for weeks.
- Quiet.

603
00:50:17,506 --> 00:50:20,539
When did she come in?
Did you see her come in?

604
00:50:21,154 --> 00:50:24,503
Now, which one of you
can tell me the difference...

605
00:50:24,706 --> 00:50:27,041
...between an Animagus
and a werewolf?

606
00:50:27,714 --> 00:50:29,569
No one?

607
00:50:30,050 --> 00:50:32,832
- How disappointing.
- Please, sir.

608
00:50:33,026 --> 00:50:36,059
An Animagus is a wizard
who elects to turn into an animal.

609
00:50:36,226 --> 00:50:37,720
A werewolf has no choice.

610
00:50:38,114 --> 00:50:39,739
With each full moon...

611
00:50:39,938 --> 00:50:43,647
...he no longer remembers who he is.
He'd kill his best friend.

612
00:50:43,842 --> 00:50:47,257
The werewolf only responds
to the call of its own kind.

613
00:50:48,386 --> 00:50:51,037
Thank you, Mr. Malfoy.
That's the second time...

614
00:50:51,202 --> 00:50:53,438
...you've spoken out of turn,
Miss Granger.

615
00:50:53,602 --> 00:50:55,512
Are you incapable
of restraining yourself...

616
00:50:55,682 --> 00:50:58,879
...or do you take pride
in being an insufferable know-it-all?

617
00:50:59,170 --> 00:51:02,432
- He's got a point, you know.
- Five points from Gryffindor.

618
00:51:02,626 --> 00:51:07,034
As an antidote to your ignorance,
and on my desk, by Monday morning...

619
00:51:07,234 --> 00:51:10,780
...two rolls of parchment
on the werewolf, with emphasis...

620
00:51:10,946 --> 00:51:13,434
...on recognizing it.
- It's Quidditch tomorrow.

621
00:51:14,498 --> 00:51:17,662
Then I suggest you take extra care,
Mr. Potter.

622
00:51:17,890 --> 00:51:21,752
Loss of limb will not excuse you.

623
00:51:21,954 --> 00:51:25,566
Page 394.

624
00:51:27,490 --> 00:51:28,897
The term "werewolf"...

625
00:51:29,762 --> 00:51:34,072
...is a contraction
of the Anglo-Saxon word "wer"...

626
00:51:34,786 --> 00:51:39,042
...which means "man," and "wolf."
Werewolf, man-wolf.

627
00:51:39,682 --> 00:51:41,919
There are several ways
to become a werewolf.

628
00:51:42,114 --> 00:51:44,984
They include being given the power
of shape-shifting...

629
00:51:45,250 --> 00:51:47,073
...being bitten by a werewolf...

630
00:52:05,122 --> 00:52:08,602
Go, Harry! Go, Harry!

631
00:54:03,490 --> 00:54:06,207
Aresto momentum!

632
00:54:08,353 --> 00:54:11,353
- He looks a bit peaky, doesn't he?
- Peaky?

633
00:54:11,522 --> 00:54:13,726
What do you expect?
He fell over 100 feet.

634
00:54:13,890 --> 00:54:16,640
Let's walk you off a tower
and see what you look like.

635
00:54:16,833 --> 00:54:19,768
Probably a right sight better
than he normally does.

636
00:54:23,266 --> 00:54:26,113
- How are you feeling?
- Oh, brilliant.

637
00:54:26,306 --> 00:54:28,193
You gave us a right good scare.

638
00:54:28,450 --> 00:54:31,799
- What happened?
- Well, you fell off your broom.

639
00:54:32,066 --> 00:54:34,302
Really? I meant the match. Who won?

640
00:54:38,561 --> 00:54:40,187
No one blames you, Harry.

641
00:54:40,418 --> 00:54:44,062
Dementors aren't supposed to be
on the grounds. Dumbledore's furious.

642
00:54:44,290 --> 00:54:46,264
After he saved you,
he sent them off.

643
00:54:46,434 --> 00:54:49,947
There's something else
you should know too.

644
00:54:50,498 --> 00:54:56,542
When you fell, your broom sort of blew
into the Whomping Willow, and...

645
00:54:57,026 --> 00:54:58,455
Well...

646
00:54:59,681 --> 00:55:01,885
I'm sorry to hear
about your broomstick.

647
00:55:02,178 --> 00:55:04,698
Is there no chance of fixing it?

648
00:55:04,898 --> 00:55:06,207
No.

649
00:55:06,370 --> 00:55:09,566
Professor, why do the dementors
affect me so?

650
00:55:09,954 --> 00:55:12,921
- I mean, more than everyone else?
- Listen.

651
00:55:13,090 --> 00:55:16,123
Dementors are the foulest creatures
to walk this earth.

652
00:55:16,322 --> 00:55:20,380
They feed on every good feeling,
every happy memory...

653
00:55:20,930 --> 00:55:25,305
...until a person is left with absolutely
nothing but his worst experiences.

654
00:55:25,538 --> 00:55:29,564
You are not weak, Harry.

655
00:55:29,730 --> 00:55:33,625
Dementors affect you most because
there are true horrors in your past.

656
00:55:33,826 --> 00:55:36,793
Horrors your classmates
can scarcely imagine.

657
00:55:37,250 --> 00:55:39,454
You have nothing to be ashamed of.

658
00:55:39,649 --> 00:55:43,511
- I'm scared, professor.
- I'd consider you a fool if you weren't.

659
00:55:43,682 --> 00:55:47,031
I need to know how to fight them.
You could teach me.

660
00:55:47,202 --> 00:55:49,111
You made the one
on the train go away.

661
00:55:49,314 --> 00:55:51,004
There was only one that night.

662
00:55:51,266 --> 00:55:55,674
- But you made it go away.
- I don't pretend to be an expert, Harry.

663
00:55:56,002 --> 00:56:00,759
But as the dementors seem
to have developed an interest in you...

664
00:56:00,929 --> 00:56:04,442
...perhaps I should teach you.
But after the holidays.

665
00:56:04,609 --> 00:56:06,431
For now, I need to rest.

666
00:56:30,850 --> 00:56:34,941
Last call for Hogsmeade!
Come on, now!

667
00:56:49,922 --> 00:56:51,831
- Guys, let me go.
- Clever, Harry.

668
00:56:52,001 --> 00:56:54,783
- But not clever enough.
- We've got a better way.

669
00:56:54,945 --> 00:56:57,662
- I'm trying to get to Hogsmeade.
- We know.

670
00:56:57,825 --> 00:56:59,135
We'll get you there.

671
00:56:59,298 --> 00:57:01,753
- We'll show you a quicker way.
- If you pipe down.

672
00:57:01,922 --> 00:57:05,369
- Bless him.
- Let me go! Come on, guys. Don't...

673
00:57:05,953 --> 00:57:08,441
- Now, Harry.
- Come and join the big boys.

674
00:57:09,793 --> 00:57:11,833
What are you doing?!

675
00:57:12,098 --> 00:57:14,781
- What's this rubbish?
- "What's this rubbish?" he says.

676
00:57:14,978 --> 00:57:18,142
- It's the secret to our success.
- It's a wrench giving it to you...

677
00:57:18,337 --> 00:57:21,120
But we've decided
your needs are greater than ours.

678
00:57:21,282 --> 00:57:22,940
George, if you will.

679
00:57:23,137 --> 00:57:26,269
I solemnly swear
that I am up to no good.

680
00:57:29,761 --> 00:57:33,209
"Messrs. Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot
and Prongs...

681
00:57:33,601 --> 00:57:36,449
...are proud to present
the Marauder's Map."

682
00:57:36,673 --> 00:57:38,845
We owe them so much.

683
00:57:42,241 --> 00:57:45,918
Hang on. This is Hogwarts.
And that...

684
00:57:46,081 --> 00:57:48,700
- No. Is that really...?
- Dumbledore.

685
00:57:48,866 --> 00:57:49,814
- In his study.
- Pacing.

686
00:57:49,986 --> 00:57:51,928
Does that a lot.

687
00:57:52,129 --> 00:57:53,885
- So this map shows...?
- Everyone.

688
00:57:54,082 --> 00:57:55,991
- Where they are.
- What they're doing.

689
00:57:56,162 --> 00:57:57,242
- Every minute.
- Every day.

690
00:57:57,410 --> 00:58:00,279
- Brilliant! Where did you get it?
- From Filch's office.

691
00:58:00,450 --> 00:58:03,068
- First year.
- There are seven secret passageways...

692
00:58:03,234 --> 00:58:05,787
...out of the castle.
- We'd recommend this one.

693
00:58:05,954 --> 00:58:08,987
- The One-Eyed Witch passageway.
- Leads you to Honeyduke's.

694
00:58:09,153 --> 00:58:10,909
Hurry. Filch is heading this way.

695
00:58:11,073 --> 00:58:14,368
And don't forget. When you're done,
00:58:14,779... > 00:58:18,936
"Mischief managed."
Otherwise, anyone can read it.

696
00:58:52,546 --> 00:58:54,684
Now, how much do you want?

697
00:59:01,665 --> 00:59:03,520
Delicious.

698
00:59:11,201 --> 00:59:15,096
It's meant to be the most haunted
building in Britain. Did I mention that?

699
00:59:15,265 --> 00:59:16,891
Twice.

700
00:59:17,569 --> 00:59:19,806
Do you want to move a bit closer?

701
00:59:20,001 --> 00:59:21,627
To the Shrieking Shack?

702
00:59:21,921 --> 00:59:24,671
Actually, I'm fine here.

703
00:59:24,834 --> 00:59:26,590
Well, well. Look who's here.

704
00:59:26,977 --> 00:59:29,149
You two shopping for your new
dream home?

705
00:59:29,378 --> 00:59:33,469
Bit grand for you, isn't it, Weasle-Bee?
Don't your family sleep in one room?

706
00:59:33,697 --> 00:59:36,763
- Shut your mouth, Malfoy.
- Not very friendly.

707
00:59:37,058 --> 00:59:41,946
Boys, I think it's time we teach
Weasle-Bee how to respect his superiors.

708
00:59:42,145 --> 00:59:45,441
- Hope you don't mean yourself.
- How dare you talk to me!

709
00:59:45,602 --> 00:59:47,511
You filthy little mudblood!

710
00:59:51,554 --> 00:59:53,015
Who is that?

711
00:59:59,009 --> 01:00:01,278
- Don't stand there! Do something!
- What?

712
01:00:20,289 --> 01:00:22,461
What's up, Malfoy? Lost your skis?

713
01:00:26,274 --> 01:00:27,648
Get out of the way!

714
01:00:28,098 --> 01:00:29,625
Move!

715
01:00:29,793 --> 01:00:32,663
Malfoy! Wait! Wait!

716
01:00:36,289 --> 01:00:38,144
Harry!

717
01:00:38,306 --> 01:00:42,201
Bloody hell, Harry.
That was not funny.

718
01:00:43,329 --> 01:00:46,428
Those weasels! Never told me
about any Marauder's Map.

719
01:00:46,657 --> 01:00:49,919
He won't keep it. He'll turn it over
to Professor McGonagall.

720
01:00:50,145 --> 01:00:53,942
- Aren't you?
- Sure. Along with his Invisibility Cloak.

721
01:00:54,114 --> 01:00:56,503
Look who it is. Madam Rosmerta.

722
01:00:56,738 --> 01:00:58,909
- Ron fancies her.
- That's not true!

723
01:00:59,073 --> 01:01:00,862
- Professor McGonagall!
- Cornelius!

724
01:01:01,057 --> 01:01:02,366
Allow me, minister.

725
01:01:02,561 --> 01:01:04,317
- Oh, Hagrid...
- Sorry about that.

726
01:01:04,514 --> 01:01:07,328
Rosmerta, my dear.
I hope business is good.

727
01:01:07,521 --> 01:01:11,231
It'd be a lot better if the Ministry
wasn't sending dementors...
