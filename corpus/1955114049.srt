1
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,791
Meet George Jetson

2
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,792
His boy, Elroy

3
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:16,476
Daughter, Judy

4
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:22,277
Jane, his wife

5
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:36,476
[suctioning]

6
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,798
[humming]

7
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:34,637
Oh, good morning, Tweeter.

8
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:37,394
[whistling]

9
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,432
[coughing]

10
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:44,116
There's that cough again.
Polly want a gas mask? [dings]

11
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:47,557
- [whistles, coughs]
- I'll bet it's the smog.

12
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:50,117
Up we go.

13
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:59,115
[snoring]

14
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,351
[Roise whirring]

15
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:06,879
Well, now we've gotten rid of the smog,
let's get of the snoring.

16
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:24,155
[grumbling]

17
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:27,233
Up and at 'em, Mr J.

18
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:30,392
Oh! Ah! Ehh!

19
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:35,430
Oh, why did you have to wake me?
I was dreaming about sleeping.

20
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,194
- [beeping]
- [whirring]

21
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,189
[screaming]

22
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:48,360
[grunting]

23
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:02,279
[laughing]

24
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:07,512
[yawns, smacks lips]

25
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:10,991
[beeping]

26
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:13,595
Mornin', Rosie.
What's for breakfast?

27
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:17,390
Orange juice, eggs, bacon,
toast with marmalade and coffee.

28
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:20,791
- How do you want your eggs? [beeps]
- Skip the eggs.

29
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:24,840
[Rosie] Watching your cholesterol,
eh, Mr J? Say, "Ahh."

30
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,276
Ahh.

31
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,038
[gulps] Mm.

32
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:32,555
You burned the toast.

33
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:35,678
- Have a good day, Dad.
- You too, Elroy.

34
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,877
- Uh, Dad?
- Yeah, Son?

35
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:41,078
You're coming to my spaceball game
today, aren't you?

36
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:43,151
It's the tournament semi-finls.

37
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:46,711
Sure, Elroy.
I wouldn't miss it for the universe.

38
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:51,314
- Starts at 4.00.
- I'll be there.

39
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:54,279
- I love you, Dad.
- Love you, Judy.

40
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:58,718
Uh, Dad? Uh, there's a dance
at school this afternoon.

41
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:01,076
- That's nice, dear.
- Oh, thanks, Dad.

42
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,878
You're outergalactic.

43
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,678
Yeah, I'm out of money too.

44
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:07,480
- Bye, darling.
- [Astro blabbering]

45
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:10,390
Astro!

46
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,399
So I forgot to say goodbye.

47
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:20,709
[garbled dog-speak] I love you, George.

48
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:24,350
I know, I know. I love you too.

49
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,394
[beeping, whirring]

50
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:40,590
[screeching]

51
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,679
Oh, no, not again.

52
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,714
[honking]

53
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:53,032
This is Rocket Rick, your Dees
drive-time digital top-ten DJ.

54
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:56,955
And here's the morning traffic advisory
for all of you poor drones

55
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,918
who have to do this every day.

56
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:01,515
[both] Turn around, go home
and go back to bed.

57
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:05,560
Very funny. Now let's have it straight
or I'm gonna be late again.

58
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:08,394
OK, here it is straight,
just for you.

59
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:13,157
The skyway's backed up from the 101
to the 202 and the 303.

60
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:15,596
- Get off and head for the 404.
- [beeping]

61
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:18,434
404, right.

62
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,679
[Rocket Rick] Oh, too late.
The 404 is jammed.

63
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:29,674
I know. I know.
It's time for the Jetson traffic-beater.

64
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:32,434
Inflate-a-Cop.

65
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:36,878
[laughing] I hate to be this sneaky,
but my job's on the line.

66
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:40,556
[siren noise]

67
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:51,796
[laughs] My siren's
getting better every day.

68
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:54,474
[siren continues]

69
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,114
[siren slows]

70
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:03,114
Roo... roo-roo-roo...

71
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,112
Roo...

72
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:08,398
Rooh-oh. [chuckles nervously]

73
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:18,678
Too bad, George.
Traffic school begins next Saturday.

74
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:21,514
In the meantime,
here's one just for you.

75
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,877
[Steve McClintock and Garm Beall:
Gotcha]

76
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:40,677
[music pitch gets higher]

77
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:01,115
[humming, beeping]

78
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:02,998
[blows]

79
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:08,439
George Jetson reporting, to say whatever
it is I do, I just did it again.

80
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:11,513
[female computer voice]
You certainly did, George.

81
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:15,389
What's our old penny-pinching,
pea-headed president up to today?

82
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:20,680
Mr Spacely is meeting with the board
of directors for the entire day.

83
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:26,836
Thank you. This is George Jetson
signing off for the entire day. Ahh.

84
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:30,630
[Spacely] And so I guarantee
to reverse the... [clears throat]

85
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:34,509
...slight downside
of our profit picture...

86
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:38,476
...with the newest development
of sprockets and spindles.

87
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,631
It had better be good, Spacely.

88
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:45,749
- It's better than good. It's cheap.
- [all] Ahh!

89
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:49,151
And that means... higher profits.

90
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:54,196
More money for you
and, of course, for me.

91
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:58,359
Gentlemen and woman,
I present to you a holographic model

92
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:00,272
of our most top-secret project,

93
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:04,195
the Spacely Sprocket and Spindle
Orbiting ore Asteroid

94
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:07,432
Manufacturing Plant Unlimited.

95
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:10,718
This plant will produce Spacely
sprockets and spindles

96
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:13,110
at one-tenth
of what it costs dawn here.

97
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,873
Yeah, when it's working.

98
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,155
I, uh, beg your pardon?

99
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,709
According to my reports,
this space station

100
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:22,191
has worked a grand total
of theree days in the last six months.

101
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:24,636
- What?! Three days?
- This is an outrage!

102
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:27,679
- What's going on here?
- [stammers] That's because

103
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:29,717
we've had leadership probles.

104
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,837
Yeah, my feeling exactly.

105
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,230
I mean leadership on the asteroid.

106
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,471
But everything is  going smoothly now

107
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:40,952
with new Vice President
Alexander Throttlebottom in charge.

108
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:45,830
Soon, we will produce our one millionth
Spacely sprocket in outer space.

109
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,994
[all] Spacely! Spacely!
Spacely! Spacely!

110
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,549
Ooh, it's so nice to be loved.

111
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:55,758
Mr Spacely, you have a call.

112
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,230
I hate it when you
interrupt my ovations.

113
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:01,518
It's important.
[whispers] We've lost another one.

114
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:02,715
What?!

115
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:06,271
[beeping]

116
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:08,317
Rudy 2, how could this happen?

117
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,710
He ran away, sir,
same as the other three.

118
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:13,235
I think he got scared and just left.

119
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:16,677
That weasel, Throttlebottom,
I knew I couldn't rely on him.

120
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:19,275
At least the plant's
still running, right?

121
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:22,831
Wrong, it's been sabotaged again.

122
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,877
[fizzling]

123
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:29,159
And I can't tell who
or what's behind it.

124
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:33,234
Well, fix it! I can't make profits
if you're not making sprockets.

125
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:35,710
Fine, but I'm not pushing that button.

126
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:40,192
But the Orbiting Ore Asteroid can't work
without someone to push the button.

127
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:43,793
I'll make you a vice president, Rudy 2.

128
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:47,919
Forget it. We've lost
four vice presidents. It's not worth it.

129
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:51,914
I'll give you a ra... raise.

130
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:54,230
No button.

131
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:57,720
What'll I do? What'll I do?

132
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:00,190
I can lick this problem. But how?

133
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:01,714
Think, Spacely, think.

134
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:06,795
First, I need a replacement
for that Throttlebottom. But who?

135
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,359
Gertrude!

136
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:12,389
- Yes, Mr Spacely?
- Take a problem.

137
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:15,472
- Need, one...
- [beeping]

138
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:19,156
...a worker who's total loyalty
is to Spacely Sprockets.

139
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:25,157
And, of course, to me, president,
CEO and all-around sweetie pie.

140
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:27,516
Two, someone expendable.

141
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:28,909
[bell dings]

142
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,912
Very funny. Theree, someone

143
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:33,720
- who will work for peanuts.
- [elephant trumpets]

144
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:35,632
Four, not too bright.

145
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:38,679
And five, someone
who can push a button.

146
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:41,150
That's it.
OK, OK, what have you got?

147
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:42,993
It's thinking, Mr Cpacely.

148
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:45,674
- It's thinking.
- [zapping, beeping]

149
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,834
Jetson?!

150
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:51,995
I wouldn't use Jetson if Spacely
Sprockets were going bankrupt!

151
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:55,312
If I needed a transfusion!
If I lost my stockholders!

152
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:57,949
My home!
If I were penniless!

153
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:59,474
Penniless?

154
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:03,429
- He is expendable.
- Perfect.

155
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,516
- Jetson!
- [screams]

156
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:09,354
You. Here. Now.

157
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:21,275
Welcome aboard,
Vice President Jetson.

158
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,953
[stutters] Vice president?

159
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:27,273
Right, vice president in charge
of the Orbiting ore Asteroid.

160
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,795
Congratulations!

161
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:31,837
Me, vice president?

162
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,516
Don't slobber, George.
You and your family leave tomorrow.

163
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,034
Go home. Pack.

164
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,919
Vice president? Pack? Go?

165
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:42,833
Ah, how quickly you grasp things.

166
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,674
I knew you were the right man
for the job up there.

167
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:46,989
Up there?

168
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:49,754
George? What do you
do for us down here?

169
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:52,639
Well, I push the button
that gets things started.

170
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:58,159
Exactly, and now, with your faily
beside you, you face a new challenge.

171
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,833
Are you up to it, Jetson?

172
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,354
Yes, sir, Mr Spacely.

173
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:04,751
- It's going to be lot of work.
- Not too much for me, sir.

174
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:08,800
Good, then roll up your sleeves.
You'll be working overtime.

175
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:14,832
- [cuckooing]
- [band plays]

176
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:20,754
Gosh, the game's almost over.
I wonder what's keeping Dad.

177
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:23,394
Elroy!

178
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,279
[girl] Go, Elroy!

179
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:28,829
- Now, coach?
- Now, Elroy.

180
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,753
The last shot of the game
to win it for us.

181
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,433
You got the tall guy on you.

182
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:37,833
- Shall I give him the Elroy Elevator?
- What else? It's the only shot you got.

183
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,231
Get out there and sink it, or I'm sunk.

184
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:45,039
Here it comes, the Elroy Elevator.

185
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:48,716
Going up, going down.
Going up, going down.

186
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,234
Going in.

187
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:51,720
[crowd cheers, screams]

188
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,675
- All right!
- [girl] Great shot, Elroy!

189
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:58,317
Hey, where's Dad?

190
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:03,919
My big moment,
and he wasn't here to see it.

191
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:08,038
[man] Will you still be there?

192
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:14,196
It's so hard to reason
with a heart out of control

193
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:20,356
Why wait to hear an answer
when it's too soon to know

194
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:26,311
Maybe love
Maybe not

195
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:29,916
No, the chance is all we're given

196
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:32,833
The chance is all we've got

197
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:38,996
Maybe love
Maybe not

198
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:45,676
Still something in me
says this may be love

199
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:52,196
All I know for certain is
I've never felt like this

200
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:58,476
A love that lasts forever
could start with just a kiss

201
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:01,595
Hey, what's your name?

202
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:04,195
Uh, Ju... Ju... Judy.

203
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:09,230
Well, Ju-Ju-Judy,
we got a date Friday night.

204
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:16,113
Maybe love
Maybe not

205
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:20,956
[squealing] You've got
a real date with Cosmic Cosmo!

206
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,713
How nebular!

207
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:25,872
- [both screaming]
- Maybe love

208
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,632
And you can be sure your donation

209
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:33,679
will help the recycling programme,
Mrs Skypad.

210
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:35,717
Thank you.

211
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:37,350
[Elroy sighs]

212
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:41,115
What's the matter, Elroy?
Did your team lose the big game?

213
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:43,271
No, I made the winning shot.

214
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:44,953
Why so upset, then?

215
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,440
Dad never showed up.

216
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:48,591
- Why, that's not like him.
- [zipping]

217
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:53,436
Tomorrow, tomorrow.
I've got a date witn Cosmic Cosmo.

218
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,034
Tomorrow!

219
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,599
Ah, young love.

220
00:16:56,760 --> 00:17:01,038
I remember one time my date and I
tripped the light fantastic,

221
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:04,033
and we tripped a few
circuit breakers too.

222
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:07,318
Hello, I'm home,
and I've got great news!

223
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:09,232
They made me a vice president.

224
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,755
- Way to go, George!
- Yay, Dad!

225
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:13,274
[all] All right!

226
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:14,475
We gotta move.

227
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:15,835
[all] Move?

228
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,436
Yep, to Spacely's Orbiting Ore Asteroid.

229
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:22,638
[all] To Spacely's
Orbiting Ore Asteroid?

230
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:25,474
- Tomorrow.
- [all] Tomorrow?

231
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:28,029
But what about my spaceball playoffs?

232
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:30,840
And my date with Cosmic Cosmo.

233
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,638
And my recycling.

234
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,677
Hey, I thought you'd be happy.

235
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:37,719
You all know how long
I've wanted to get a promotion.

236
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:40,918
And besides,
I'm doing it all for you, my family.

237
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:44,310
[garbled dog-speak] Ah, George.

238
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:49,757
Your father's right, kids.
I'm sorry, honey.

239
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:51,718
I'm really thrilled for you.

240
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:53,678
Metacataclysmic.

241
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:57,549
- Her life is over.
- My life is over!

242
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:00,712
She just needs to get used to the idea.

243
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:05,113
She's not the only one.
Oh, well, maybe it won't be so bad.

244
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:09,194
How long can Mr J last
as a vice president anyways?

245
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:12,034
I'll start packing.

246
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:19,993
Don't be so glum, Elroy.
With my new job, I can set my own hours.

247
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,470
We'll have lost of extra time together.

248
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:25,519
Then you can help me perfect
my Elroy Elevator shot?

249
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:27,830
Son, we'll make you a spaceball star.

250
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,958
[Shane Sutton: Staying Together]

251
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:18,238
Thare it is.

252
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:24,839
It won't be long now.

253
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:27,549
Yeah, I can hardly wait.

254
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:32,156
[Jane] Look, Judy,
it's got a shopping mall.

255
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:34,072
A mall?

256
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:37,437
Oh, nothing matters without Cosmo.

257
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:47,438
[Jane] It doesn't look so bad at all.

258
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:51,037
[Rosie] I hope they have
a Quickie Lube Robot Repair.

259
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:56,036
My arm squeaks from all that packin'.

260
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:59,956
Look, there's the Orbiting Ore Asteroid.

261
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,957
And there's the new plant.

262
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:14,715
Your new plant, Mr Vice President.

263
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,110
[laughing] Well...

264
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:30,279
[George] Hey, take a look. Our new
hometown. Intergalactic Garden Estates.

265
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:34,877
[Rosie] It doesn't look like
anyplace I've ever seen before.

266
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:41,031
What's this, the garage?

267
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,157
It's very nice, George.

268
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:45,311
- [Rosie] Oh, brother!
- [sighs]

269
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:48,438
Oh, I guess I can do something with it.

270
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:50,591
You're gonna have to.
It's empty.

271
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:56,199
Well, uh, maybe the furniture and stuff
is just late being delivered, maybe.

272
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:58,590
- Where's my room?
- Where's the kitchen?

273
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:02,833
Where's the phone? I've gotta call
Francie and find out what I'm missing.

274
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,152
I wonder if this thing works up here.

275
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:12,271
[gasps] Say! Oh, how nice.

276
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,559
Yeow!

277
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:26,629
[zaps]

278
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:29,838
Whoo! Ahh!

279
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:34,874
Oh, wow! This is orbital!

280
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:39,435
Come on, boy!
Let's give this thing a whirl.

281
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,830
- All right!
- What'll it be, Astro?

282
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,673
Slow, medium of fast?

283
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:45,592
Slow!

284
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:51,837
Jane! Get me off this crazy thing!

285
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:04,957
Oh, boy! This is better than home!

286
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,356
Say, isn't this nice.
"Welcome Jetsons."

287
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:19,589
Hey! Whoa! Hold it!

288
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:21,159
[doorbell rings]

289
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:22,640
Now, who could that be?

290
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:26,953
Welcome wagon!
I'm your upstairs neighbour, Lucy 2!

291
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:29,999
Oh, thank you, Lucy.
How nice.

292
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:32,913
I'm Jane Jetson. George,

293
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:36,118
come meet one of our new neighbours.
That's my husband.

294
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:37,714
What breed is he?

295
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:42,033
No, not Astro.
Him, George.

296
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:44,589
Him George!

297
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:46,194
Now cut that out!

298
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:49,398
Hi, glad to...

299
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:52,951
See you guys!
Gotta check this place out!

300
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:58,149
I just found out Doris told Susie, and
Susie told Mary, and Mary and Francie,

301
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:02,712
and Francie told me,
Helen took my date with Cosmo!

302
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:05,872
And now my heart is
totally broken! [crying]

303
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:09,999
I'll never be happy again.
Never, never, never, never.

304
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:15,189
I hate this place! [sobbing]

305
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:18,239
Don't worry.
Kids are all the same.

306
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,710
- You have kids?
- Oh, yes!

307
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:23,599
In fact, your son might run into ny son,
Teddy 2.

308
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,114
Where's your husband?

309
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:28,557
You'll meet Ruby 2 at the plant.
He works there.

310
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:31,712
He does? Oh, great!
I'll see him in the morning.

311
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:34,633
- That's the big startup day.
- Again.

312
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:35,915
I beg your pardon?

313
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:38,435
Oh, nothing. Well, enjoy the goodies.

314
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:41,752
If you'd like me to show you
around the mall tomorrow...

315
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,479
That sounds like fun.

316
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:46,758
Judy, how'd you like to go shopping
at the mall tomorrow?

317
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:50,834
I can't. I can't.
What time does it open?

318
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:53,315
Shall I serve dinner?

319
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:56,040
Elroy's not back yet.
I'm getting worried.

320
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:57,759
[doorbell rings]

321
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:59,559
Hi. Sorry I'm late.

322
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:01,631
You should know better than...

323
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:03,473
Yikes!

324
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:08,760
Hold it! How many times
have I told you not to bring in pets?

325
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:11,230
I know, Dad, but he followed me home.

326
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:12,674
Can I keep him, please?

327
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:14,353
[growling]

328
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:16,431
Hmm. [sniffing]

329
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:19,638
[giggling]

330
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:21,393
[sniffing]

331
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:25,076
Huh? [chuckles]

332
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:27,151
Can I keep him, Dad? Can I?

333
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:30,756
- No, of course not!
- He's awfully cute.

334
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:33,389
Well, now, suppose he
belongs to somebody.

335
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:35,233
- Like who?
- Like us.

336
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:36,913
Sorry, but the door was open.

337
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:39,071
We've been looking
for the little one.

338
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:43,393
Fergie Furbelow! You know better
than to wander off like that.

339
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:45,836
Well, what have you got to
say for yourself?

340
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,991
[cooing] Mama.

341
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:53,231
We're the Furbelows.
Bertie Furbelow. Gertie Furbelow.

342
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:56,438
And that's our little Fergie.
She's a girl.

343
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:58,034
How can you tell?

344
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:59,235
Uh, we're...

345
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:02,119
The Jetsons.
George, Jane, Judy and Elroy.

346
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:04,112
We know. Been expectin' you.

347
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:06,749
We're all the way from
the outer rings of Krile.

348
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:08,831
Now we're your next door neighbours.

349
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,277
Oh! Well, we're pleased to meet you.

350
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:15,319
Come on. Let's give 'em
some peace their first day.

351
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:18,359
If you need anything,
we're right through the wall.

352
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:20,750
Hope you like Furbelow music, George.

353
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:24,276
Got super surround sound
sonic boomers in our place.

354
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:26,670
Uh, what is Furbelow music?

355
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:29,036
Mostly drums and chants, you know.

356
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,919
[singing drum beat]

357
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:33,957
Oh, you'll love it.

358
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:37,909
So welcome, all you Jetsons,
to Intergalactic Garden Estates.

359
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:40,959
[singing drum beat]

360
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:43,999
[blabbering]

361
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:55,391
[squealing]

362
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:57,918
- Weird, huh?
- [laughs]

363
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:01,152
I wonder what they're saying about us.

364
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:04,672
You know, George,
I've got the strangest feeling

365
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:07,798
something wonderful's going
to happen to us up here.

366
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:10,759
That's funny.
I feel the same way.

367
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:13,150
Good night, George.

368
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:14,833
Good night, dear.

369
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,877
[snaps fingers]

370
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:02,830
[pitter-patter]

371
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,116
[fizzling]

372
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:16,314
[George snoring]

373
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:20,714
[Jane] Wake up, George.

374
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:23,315
[groaning]

375
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:26,836
Come on, Mr Vice President, darling.
Up and at 'em.

376
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,389
[continues groaning]

377
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:32,632
Stand back, Mrs J.
Let's see what this does.

378
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:37,671
[George screams]

379
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:46,518
Ow! Hey, what the...?

380
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:50,116
Hey!

381
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:57,189
Good morning, Mr Jetson.
Sit back, relax.

382
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:59,112
I'm Mac, your transportation.

383
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:02,875
We're on your own personal skyway,
taking you right to the plant.

384
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:08,069
Huh? You mean no traffic?
No gridlock? No skyway patrol?

385
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:09,469
That's right, bub.

386
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:11,358
My dream come true.

387
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:14,672
Wait a minute.
I can't go to the office in my pyjamas.

388
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:19,038
Hey, no problem.
We groom you on the way.

389
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:22,272
Hey! Easy! Whoa! Watch it!

390
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:26,190
Not bad.

391
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:30,520
Goodbye, darling.

392
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:33,593
- Have a nice day, Dad.
- Thanks, son.

393
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:38,197
- Bye, Dad.
- Enjoy the mall, dear. Feel better.

394
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:40,829
I love you, George!

395
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:43,591
Yech.

396
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:49,511
Ah, this is the life.
To the office, Mac!

397
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:00,157
[George] Hi! You must be Rudy 2.

398
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:02,277
Pleased to meet you, Mr Jetson.

399
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:06,115
Call me George.
Wow, what a place.

400
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:09,750
Well, I guess we should
have a staff meeting.

401
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:11,877
I'd like to meet all the employees.

402
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:14,111
You just did. Ha-ha!

403
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:17,716
You mean, you and me?
That's it?

404
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:22,113
That's why it's so cheap to make
sprockets here. We're fully automated.

405
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:26,513
But it's still all in your hands,
George. Or should I say, your finger.

406
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:29,149
Thare's the drilling bore.
It brings up the ore.

407
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:31,152
[George] The bore brings up the ore.

408
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:33,118
- Got it.
- The ore makes the sprockets.

409
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:34,679
[George] The ore
makes the sprockets?

410
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:36,592
- Uh-huh
- Uh-huh

411
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:38,273
[Rudy 2] Pack the sprockets
into packets

412
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:41,558
- Sack the packets into brackets?
- [Ruby 2] For the lockers

413
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:44,109
Lock the key in the pocket
of your jacket

414
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:46,669
Got the locker key
in my outer jacket pocket

415
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:49,070
- Are you ready?
- I'm ready!

416
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:51,675
[Ruby 2] Take the bored ore packets
from the packet brackets

417
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:54,150
- And we rocket
- While we're rappin'

418
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:56,596
[both] Yes, we rocket
while we're rappin'

419
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:58,956
And we rocket
the sprockets to Spacely

420
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:00,599
Yeah!

421
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:02,433
Hey, you've done everything.

422
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:05,718
Everything but press the button
that gets it all going.

423
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:09,350
That's your job, George.
And Mr Spacely says you're the best!

424
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:13,309
Well, I wouldn't say that.
But well, yes, maybe I would.

425
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:15,630
I just have to make a few adjustments,

426
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:18,713
then we'll notify Mr Spacely
we're ready to start.

427
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:22,760
I love my job.
Tell me when you're ready, Rudy.

428
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:26,231
Yes, Mr Vice President.

429
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:30,512
Call me for lunch. [exhales]

430
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:32,876
[snoring]

431
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:37,398
Hmm. This is our fifth opening day
at the new plant.

432
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:40,871
Jetson better not mess this thing up.

433
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:47,512
[Lucy 2] George's button-pushing
ceremony begins at noon.

434
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:49,318
And we don't have too much time,

435
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:52,313
so we'lljust make this
a quick little look-around.

436
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:55,393
And here we are, the Galaxy Galleria.

437
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:07,918
[woman over PA]
Credit chips to the right, ladies.

438
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:13,709
[robotic barking]

439
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:17,589
I hope George's credit is good up here.

440
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:22,990
It's lunaristic!

441
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:27,479
- Except that Cosmic Cosmo isn't here.
- [giggling]

442
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:33,636
Mon, I'd sort of like to wander around
by myself, if you guys don't mind.

443
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:38,114
Sure, go ahead. Just back in time
for us to get to Dad's ceremony.

444
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:41,432
No problem. Thanks.

445
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:45,152
[sighs] Maybe I'll go
up to the nature zone.

446
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:57,518
No

447
00:31:57,680 --> 00:32:02,834
I'm not making that promise again

448
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:07,198
Nothing can change my mind

449
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:11,917
Nothing at all

450
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:14,515
'Cause love

451
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:19,516
Has a way of coming undone

452
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:25,312
Till I'm all alone with my heart

453
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:29,110
And here I'll stay

454
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:34,480
And I always thought I'd see you again

455
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:38,120
Oh, how it hurts every time

456
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:41,318
You've crossed my heart since then

457
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:43,835
God, I'd give it all it takes

458
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,310
To hold what might have been

459
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:51,270
'Cause I always thought
I'd see you again

460
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:58,039
Love doesn't come when you need love

461
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:03,832
It's not always there when you fall

462
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,832
Try as you may

463
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:09,880
You've got nothing to say

464
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:15,677
Nothing at all

465
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:28,277
I always thought I'd see you again

466
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:32,114
Oh, how it hurts every time

467
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:35,318
You've crossed my heart again

468
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:37,835
God, I'd give it all it takes

469
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,514
To hold what might have been

470
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:45,993
'Cause I always thought
I'd see you again

471
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:52,994
'Cause I always thought
I'd see you

472
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:58,277
Again

473
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:06,916
Ooh, that Cosmic Cosmo!
I'll never trust another boy ever again.

474
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:11,558
[both grunting]

475
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:16,630
Ooh, you dumb, dumb, duh...

476
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,518
- Dummy?
- Uh-huh

477
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:21,194
Uh-huh, right.

478
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:23,112
[both] It was all my fault.

479
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:27,399
[laughing] My name's Apollo Blue.

480
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:31,995
I'm Judy. [gasps] Oh, my gosh!

481
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:34,993
It's two minutes to 12.00!
I've gotta go!

482
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:40,439
Don't tell me you turn
into a pumpkin. Hey!

483
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:43,479
See you tomorrow, pumpkin?
Same time, same place?

484
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:47,998
Yeah! Cosmagoric City!

485
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:50,555
[chattering]

486
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:55,314
[whistling]

487
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:57,994
Elroy Jetson?

488
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:00,151
Here, coach.

489
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:03,239
You pair off with Teddy 2
for a little one-on-one.

490
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:06,074
- I wanna see your best shot.
- Sure, coach.

491
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:09,554
Hi. You any good?

492
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:13,156
My name may be Teddy 2,
but I'm number one.

493
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:14,913
You mean you were.

494
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:18,072
Back home they ysed to call this
the Elroy Elevator.

495
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:21,791
Going up.

496
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:29,393
Going down. Going in!

497
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:33,000
[Teddy 2] No way, Elray.

498
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:40,353
That's two for Teddy 2.

499
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:43,160
I think your elevator is out of order.

500
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:47,678
- Comin' to the ceremony?
- You bet.

501
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:51,069
[Spacely] It's D-Day,
gentlemen and woman.

502
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:55,552
Or as I prefer to call it, P-Day!
P for profits!

503
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:58,439
Today, the one millionth
Spacely Sprocket.

504
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:01,319
Tomorrow, the universe!

505
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:05,439
It gives me great pleasure

506
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:10,959
to introduce our new vice president
up at the Orbiting Ore Asteroid...

507
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:14,235
...George Jetson.

508
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:15,714
That's my George!

509
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:16,870
Way to do, Dad!

510
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:20,635
Elroy, I know you're father
hasn't had much time for you lately,

511
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:23,189
but couldn't you show him
a little support?

512
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:25,271
OK.

513
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:26,555
Jetson!

514
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:28,233
[gasps, chuckles]

515
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:32,553
Oh, there you are, Mr Spacely.
And... hi to you, Board.

516
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:33,869
- Hello, George!
- Hi!

517
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:37,237
Before this finger presses
the button to start the plant,

518
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:40,233
I'd like to say a few words
of thanks to Mr Spacely

519
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:43,153
for making this day possible
for my family and...

520
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:45,834
Cool it, Jetson.
Just push the stupid button.

521
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,513
Uh... yes, sir.

522
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:52,277
And now, the moment
we've all been waiting for!

523
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:57,392
[engines whirring, clattering]

524
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:01,873
[all] Spacely! Spacely! Spacely!

525
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:13,079
- Yay, Daddy!
- That's my George!

526
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:49,599
Here it comes.

527
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:53,034
All right, 999.

528
00:37:57,320 --> 00:38:02,394
One mil... 998, 997.

529
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:04,870
It's going backwards!

530
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:07,677
Yeow!

531
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:14,151
Oh, no! Not again!

532
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:17,989
[shrieking] Look out!

533
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:21,229
Ow!

534
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:25,519
Watch out, Teddy 2!
I'll save you!

535
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:28,194
Elroy! Whare's Elroy?

536
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:29,873
And Teddy 2.

537
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:32,714
Son! Son!

538
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:41,677
[yelping]

539
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:52,036
What the...? Jetson! [echoing]

540
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:55,875
- Mr Spa... Spa... Spa...
- What's going on up there?

541
00:38:56,040 --> 00:39:00,238
[stammering] A bricken bracken's broken
in the sproken locken!

542
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:04,359
I mean... new glitches
always have plants.

543
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:10,552
You're destroying my plant!
Turn the machines off! Turn them off!

544
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:13,758
Yes, sir! Right aways, sir!

545
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:18,839
[whirring stops]

546
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,594
- It's off, sir.
- [Spacely] Get it started soon.

547
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:23,637
Lost time means lost money.

548
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:27,953
And lost money means
lost vice president.

549
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:30,316
- Get it?
- [gulping]

550
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:33,074
So can I stay over
with Elroy tonight, Mom? huh?

551
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:37,791
Dear, I'm not sure that's a good idea
tonight, after what happened.

552
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:42,909
Aw, Mom, please? Elroy saved me,
he's my new best friend.

553
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:45,554
It's all right with me.

554
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:51,477
Oh, all right.
But first let me give you a hand.

555
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:54,200
Ah, that feels better.

556
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:58,638
Say thanks to Mrs Jetson,
be a good boy and stay well-oild.

557
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:00,393
[both] All right!

558
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:03,029
George, there's something
you should know.

559
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:07,512
Since the plant opened, there's
been an unusual amount of... of...

560
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:08,954
Glitches?

561
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:12,795
Uh-huh. I thought we cleared them
all up, but they keep happening.

562
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:15,395
It may be safer for you to just leave.

563
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:20,031
What? And lose my chance
to be a vice president? No way!

564
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:22,635
- But, George, there's...
- Not another word.

565
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:25,360
George Jetson
doesn't run away from a glitch.

566
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:27,875
We just need to make
a few repairs tomorrow,

567
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:31,271
and then the magic Jetson finger
will show just what it can do.

568
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:35,195
[groaning]

569
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:38,079
[yelping]

570
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:03,638
[zapping]

571
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:07,277
[zapping]

572
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:34,270
You're in early.

573
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:38,673
That's because today's the day
we're gonna lick these glitches, Rudy.

574
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:44,038
- Ready?
- Are you sure you want to do this?

575
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:47,795
Yes.
My first vice-presidential decision.

576
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:50,270
- Bingo!
- [whirring]

577
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:51,635
[rumbling]

578
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:56,590
Circuit breaker's broken in the sprocket
locker bracket. I'll get a new one.

579
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:04,840
[yelping]

580
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:25,274
- [George yelling]
- George? Jogging? This early?

581
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:32,673
Ahh! Stop this crazy thing!

582
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:35,593
I can't! I can't! It's stuck!

583
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:55,109
Now what, Jetson?
What is it this time?

584
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:58,318
[muffled] Just another little glitch,
Mr Spacely.

585
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:01,313
Another little glitch, eh?

586
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:05,269
- Yes, sir.
- I think I know what the glitch is.

587
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:08,398
- And I'm looking at him!
- [swallows]

588
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:12,030
Gertrude, this is an emergency.

589
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:15,477
Book me on the next cheap flight
to the asteroid.

590
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:27,757
May I get you anything?

591
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:30,309
Don't give those guys
any more doughnuts.

592
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:33,552
[puttering]

593
00:43:38,840 --> 00:43:43,118
[guitar strumming]

594
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:47,998
I didn't know the Galleria
had any place like this.

595
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:50,151
It's metagalactical!

596
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:52,197
No, don't!

597
00:43:52,360 --> 00:43:54,874
- You all right?
- Uh-huh, I think.

598
00:43:56,320 --> 00:43:58,516
[chuckling]

599
00:43:58,680 --> 00:44:00,876
- This as all a hologram.
- Wow.

600
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:02,314
It looks so real.

601
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:07,998
You can punch up all kinds
of make-believe scenery.

602
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:11,437
It's beautiful.

603
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:13,150
[strums guitar]

604
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:16,153
That song you're playing,
is that the one you sent to me?

605
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:18,550
Yeah, do you remember the words?

606
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:20,597
Uh, I think so.

607
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:24,833
[Tiffany: You and Me]

608
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:09,119
- That was great!
- Thanks.

609
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:12,159
My boyfriend back home
was a musician too.

610
00:46:12,320 --> 00:46:18,032
- Uh, my former boyfriend.
- Well, isn't this a small galaxy.

611
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:22,473
[doorbell rings]

612
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:26,954
Mr J!

613
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:29,954
Don't say a word.

614
00:46:31,120 --> 00:46:34,431
- Poor Mr J.
- All he needs is a good night's sleep.

615
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:36,034
Or a chiropractor.

616
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:40,398
oh, I had no idea being
a vice president could be so dangerous.

617
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:42,676
There's something going on, George.

618
00:46:42,840 --> 00:46:47,038
The two sprocket lockers were unscrewed
from the locked sprocket sockets.

619
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:49,077
- Say that again.
- [Rudy 2] I can't.

620
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:51,231
You mean these weren't accidents?

621
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:54,438
- No, they were a warning.
- A what?

622
00:46:54,600 --> 00:46:57,240
A warning. To close down the plant.

623
00:46:57,400 --> 00:46:59,073
I might as well tell you.

624
00:46:59,240 --> 00:47:01,914
We've been getting them
since the plant opened.

625
00:47:02,080 --> 00:47:05,152
it's why Spacely's gone
through four vice presidents.

626
00:47:05,320 --> 00:47:07,914
- Four?
- They all had accidents just like this

627
00:47:08,080 --> 00:47:10,151
- then left.
- Well, I'm not leaving.

628
00:47:10,320 --> 00:47:12,914
George Jetson
doesn't scare that easily.

629
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:16,038
Someone's sneaking in at night
and fouling things up.

630
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:19,556
So that means we've got to
go back tonight and keep watch.

631
00:47:19,720 --> 00:47:21,836
- Good luck, George.
- Huh?

632
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:25,709
I'm sorry, George. I like you,
but I've got to think about my family.

633
00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:29,236
- I've got three oil spouts to fill.
- I understand, Rudy.

634
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:31,994
This is a job
for a vice president, anyway.

635
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:36,154
George Jetson is mad,
and he's not gonna take it anymore.

636
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:39,549
Ohh!

637
00:47:39,720 --> 00:47:40,994
Dad needs help.

638
00:47:41,160 --> 00:47:44,596
Tonight, I'll help him sole
the mystery of those accidents.

639
00:47:44,760 --> 00:47:47,991
All I need is my detecto kit.

640
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:49,719
And me.

641
00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:52,840
No, Teddy 2.
I can't ask you to help.

642
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:54,274
Well, you helped me.

643
00:47:54,440 --> 00:47:58,274
Besides, you don't even know
the layout of the plant. I'm going.

644
00:47:58,440 --> 00:48:02,115
Great! Me too. [sniffing]

645
00:48:02,280 --> 00:48:07,036
No, Astro. Not you too.
And not you, either, Fergie.

646
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:08,838
Ohh!

647
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,640
- Why not?
- Yeah, why not?

648
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:14,599
Why not?
Because Mom needs you here.

649
00:48:14,760 --> 00:48:17,991
- You've got to look after her.
- Right!

650
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:21,118
OK. Then as soon as it gets dark,
we sneak out the back,

651
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:24,511
then we'll go down to the plant,
and we'll use my detecto kit.

652
00:48:36,920 --> 00:48:42,871
All right, vandals. Now you've got
George Jetson to deal with.

653
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:47,398
- [crashing]
- [gasps]

654
00:48:51,080 --> 00:48:53,594
[clattering]

655
00:48:59,800 --> 00:49:02,633
I'll be waitin' for 'em,
eyes and ears open,

656
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:07,158
coiled like a tiget, ready to spring.

657
00:49:08,200 --> 00:49:12,080
[snoring]

658
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:17,591
[gibbering]

659
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:27,755
[gibbering continues]

660
00:49:56,080 --> 00:49:58,310
All clear.

661
00:50:05,720 --> 00:50:09,509
George? George?

662
00:50:12,080 --> 00:50:14,640
I just wanted to make sure you were OK.

663
00:50:18,600 --> 00:50:20,511
Hmm.

664
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:24,638
[male voice on TV]
Oh, Galaxina, just because I'm a robot

665
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:26,837
doesn't mean we
can't have children.

666
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:28,115
[sobbing]

667
00:50:28,280 --> 00:50:31,318
[narrator on TV] Will Galaxina
pull the plug on her romance?

668
00:50:31,480 --> 00:50:35,439
[wailing]

669
00:50:37,080 --> 00:50:42,359
[narrator on TV] Tune in tomorrow
for another episode of All My Androids.

670
00:50:42,520 --> 00:50:46,036
Rosie, be careful.
You'll rust up again.

671
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:48,714
[doorbell rings]

672
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:53,477
- Mrs Jetson, did George come home?
- [weepily] No, he's at the plant.

673
00:50:53,640 --> 00:50:57,474
No, he's not. I was just there.
He's... he's disappeared.

674
00:50:57,640 --> 00:51:01,952
Disappeared? [gasps]
Oh, no! Elroy and Teddy 2!

675
00:51:02,120 --> 00:51:04,953
[gasps] Oh, on! Elroy!

676
00:51:06,520 --> 00:51:10,514
- Where could those kids have gone?
- [Astro] Elroy detective.

677
00:51:10,680 --> 00:51:13,479
Detective? Elroy's playing detective?

678
00:51:13,640 --> 00:51:14,630
Where?

679
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:19,671
Oh, on! The plant!
Is that where he's gone?

680
00:51:19,840 --> 00:51:22,832
- Right! With Teddy 2!
- With Teddy 2!

681
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:26,470
You sure? I didn't see them there,
and the plant's all locked up.

682
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:29,200
I don't know how they'd get in.

683
00:51:31,480 --> 00:51:35,075
I didn't remember the vent was so high.

684
00:51:36,840 --> 00:51:41,232
- My detecto kit has a rope.
- [laughing] Rope?

685
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:50,035
Grad my ankles.
I'll show you my elevator.

686
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:53,318
Wow!

687
00:51:55,160 --> 00:51:58,630
Going up! Going in!

[Shane Sutton: First Time in Love]

689
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:29,472
- [fake coughing on monitor] Excuse me.
- Mother?

690
00:52:29,640 --> 00:52:33,156
I'm sorry, but you know I wouldn't call
if it weren't important.

691
00:52:33,320 --> 00:52:36,836
- Is Elroy with you?
- Elroy? No.

692
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:40,470
He and Teddy have wandered off.
I need you to help me find them.

693
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:44,190
Search the mall, search the school.
They might be at the plant.

694
00:52:44,360 --> 00:52:46,271
- Now?
- Now.

695
00:52:46,440 --> 00:52:48,351
[groaning]

696
00:52:48,520 --> 00:52:51,353
I knew you'd understand.

697
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:56,310
[gibbering]

698
00:52:56,480 --> 00:52:59,438
[Teddy 2] The light switch
is over here somewhere.

[zapping]

701
00:53:05,080 --> 00:53:07,913
What was that noise?

702
00:53:27,640 --> 00:53:30,439
[Elroy] Here's the light switch.

703
00:53:30,600 --> 00:53:32,591
[rattling]

704
00:53:32,760 --> 00:53:35,752
- There's that noise.
- It came from over here.

705
00:53:37,720 --> 00:53:41,759
- There it is again.
- I'll get some fingerprint powder.

706
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:48,759
I wonder where Dad is.
Hey! Where's my kit?

707
00:53:48,920 --> 00:53:50,877
Huh? What's going on?

708
00:53:59,800 --> 00:54:02,997
Ready, set, go!

709
00:54:03,160 --> 00:54:05,151
- Fergie!
- Gotcha!

710
00:54:05,320 --> 00:54:06,913
Grungee!

711
00:54:07,080 --> 00:54:09,196
- Grungee?
- Ooh.

712
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:12,676
Aw, Grungee.

713
00:54:12,840 --> 00:54:16,356
How do you know what he is, Fergie?

714
00:54:16,520 --> 00:54:21,196
Fergie, Grungees play.
Squeep!

715
00:54:21,360 --> 00:54:24,990
- Squeep? And you play with them?
- Uh-huh.

716
00:54:25,160 --> 00:54:27,071
- Squeep.
- Squeep.

717
00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:31,393
So it's you little guys
causing the accidents.

[whimpering]

722
00:54:50,440 --> 00:54:54,798
I'm programmed for most languages
and I can tell you the Grungee community

723
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:57,520
is not very happy with
what we're doing here.

724
00:54:57,680 --> 00:54:59,000
What are we doing here?

725
00:54:59,160 --> 00:55:01,674
He says we've been
destroying their town.

726
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:05,959
My dad? No way!
I want to see for myself.

Well, well, look what we've got here.

731
00:55:18,720 --> 00:55:21,997
Elroy, you're coming home
with me right...

732
00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:24,515
hey, what's that cute little guy?

733
00:55:24,680 --> 00:55:27,957
- That's Squeep.
- I believe we've solved the mystery.

734
00:55:28,120 --> 00:55:30,919
He's the reason
the plant's being sabotaged.

735
00:55:31,080 --> 00:55:32,639
Come with us. Will you, guys?

736
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:37,078
I've got a feeling
we're gonna need your help.

737
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:44,272
Teddy, are you programmed to be scared?

738
00:55:44,440 --> 00:55:47,831
- No.
- [Elroy] I am.

739
00:56:02,240 --> 00:56:05,710
Come on, follow me.
Come on, come on.

740
00:56:05,880 --> 00:56:11,876
- Gee, I don't know about this.
- Yeah. Where are we anyway?

741
00:56:14,080 --> 00:56:16,515
Yike! Ahh!

742
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:18,714
[both scream]

743
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:20,279
Shh.

744
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:30,675

- Hello? Anyone, hello?

[all muttering]

746
00:56:40,640 --> 00:56:41,630
Hey!

747
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:48,039
- Look at these little guys.
- Yeah, they're great.

748
00:56:49,600 --> 00:56:51,238

750
00:56:56,880 --> 00:56:58,553
Oh, on.

751
00:56:58,720 --> 00:57:01,678
What are we doing?

752
00:57:05,120 --> 00:57:08,829
- We're desrtoying their homes.

[birping]

755
00:57:14,840 --> 00:57:17,036
Is everything all right back here?

756
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:20,479
Oh, what a way to fly.

757
00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:28,396
- Elroy!
- Teddy!

758
00:57:28,560 --> 00:57:30,836

Elroy! George!

761
00:57:39,960 --> 00:57:41,109
Are they down there?

762
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:43,992
There, down there.

763
00:57:44,520 --> 00:57:48,673
How awful, you poor thing.
We've got to do something.

764
00:57:48,840 --> 00:57:50,956
But what?

765
00:57:53,680 --> 00:57:56,957
Really don't like the looks of this.

766
00:57:57,120 --> 00:57:59,714
Are you sure they're down there, Astro?

767
00:57:59,880 --> 00:58:02,599
Right. [gulps] I hope so.

768
00:58:02,760 --> 00:58:05,070
We'll just get Dad
to shut down the plant.

769
00:58:05,240 --> 00:58:07,709
He can't do that. It's his job.

770
00:58:07,880 --> 00:58:09,439
And my dad's too.

771
00:58:09,600 --> 00:58:10,829

774
00:58:18,440 --> 00:58:21,637
But where's Mom? You're supposed
to be looking after mom.

775
00:58:21,800 --> 00:58:24,997
Right here, son. And you've got
a lot of explaining to do.

776
00:58:25,160 --> 00:58:27,436
Are you all right, Mrs J? [echoing]

777
00:58:29,480 --> 00:58:33,474
I'm fine. I found everybody. [echoing]

778
00:58:33,640 --> 00:58:37,076

[muffled yelling]

782
00:58:48,360 --> 00:58:49,350
George?

783
00:58:52,800 --> 00:58:55,872
Oh, George! I love you, George!

784

[grunting]

787
00:59:03,960 --> 00:59:06,839
- Are you all right, Dad?
- No! I'm not all right!

788
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,879
I was kidnapped
by these vicious little furballs

789
00:59:10,040 --> 00:59:12,270
with beady eyes and razor teeth.

790
00:59:12,440 --> 00:59:15,592
But, Dad, they were just
trying to save their homes.

791
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:19,310
- You're destroying their city.
- They didn't know what elsa to do.

792
00:59:19,480 --> 00:59:22,916

[screaming]

795
00:59:29,280 --> 00:59:31,749
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

796
00:59:32,680 --> 00:59:34,079
Ahh!

797
00:59:41,600 --> 00:59:43,079
[stammering] What's that?

798
00:59:43,240 --> 00:59:47,438
Darling, I'm afraid we
have to have a little talk.

799
00:59:47,600 --> 00:59:49,750
[whispering]

800
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:53,038
You want me to do what? [echoing]

801
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:55,589
I'm finally a vice president
after years of

802
00:59:55,760 --> 00:59:58,832
"yes, Mr Spacely,"
"absolutely, Mr Spacely,"

803
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:01,037
"oh, and by the way, Mr Spacely,

804
01:00:01,200 --> 01:00:05,114
now that I'm a vice president,
my family wants me to close your plant

805
01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:07,999
and lose my job,
just as I've reached the top."

806
01:00:08,160 --> 01:00:12,279
No! No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

807
01:00:12,440 --> 01:00:13,669
And that's final!

808
01:00:13,840 --> 01:00:16,753
Well, we'll just see about that.

809
01:00:16,920 --> 01:00:22,677
- Now, cloud someone please untie me?
- Not yet.

810
01:00:24,920 --> 01:00:27,196
First, we negotiate.

811
01:00:27,360 --> 01:00:31,831
What? Are you Jane Jetson?
Are you my wife?

812
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:35,959
- Do you love me?
- Yes, but do you love your family?

813
01:00:36,120 --> 01:00:38,430
'Course I do. You're all I think about.

814
01:00:38,600 --> 01:00:41,114
All you've thought about lately
is your job.

815
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:44,193
Yeah, Dad.
You've been so wrapped up in work,

816
01:00:44,360 --> 01:00:45,919
you haven't had time for us.

817
01:00:46,080 --> 01:00:48,390
OK, I'll put in for a long vacation,

818
01:00:48,560 --> 01:00:51,632
but it'll have to wait
until I get the plant going again.

819
01:00:51,800 --> 01:00:54,918
- That's no good, George.
- What else do you want?

820
01:00:55,080 --> 01:00:57,913
George, all I ask
is that you look around

821
01:00:58,080 --> 01:01:00,515
and see what your job is making you do.

822
01:01:00,680 --> 01:01:04,196
No job is worth destroying
the lives of innocent creatures.

823
01:01:04,360 --> 01:01:05,680
See for yourself.

824
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:12,994
[George] Oh, my gosh, it's a city.

825
01:01:13,160 --> 01:01:16,949
[Jane] It's more than a city.
It's their entire world,

826
01:01:17,120 --> 01:01:19,316
and you're destroying it...

827
01:01:19,480 --> 01:01:21,710
...and them.

828
01:01:21,880 --> 01:01:25,760
Mr Jetson, the Grungees really feel bad
about taking you down here.

829
01:01:25,920 --> 01:01:28,116
But as you can see, they were desperate.

830
01:01:28,280 --> 01:01:30,749
But... but what can I do?

831
01:01:31,080 --> 01:01:32,957
Jetson? Jetson!

832
01:01:33,320 --> 01:01:34,549
Mr Spacely.

833
01:01:34,720 --> 01:01:37,314
Where's Jetson?
And why is the plant shut down?

834
01:01:37,480 --> 01:01:41,235
- It's the middle of the night.
- Machines don't sleep! Start it up!

835
01:01:41,400 --> 01:01:43,391
Every second lost means money lost.

836
01:01:43,560 --> 01:01:45,995
And money lost means I scream a lot!

837
01:01:46,160 --> 01:01:47,878
But what about the Jetsons?

838
01:01:48,040 --> 01:01:49,394
Forget that idiot Jetson.

839
01:01:49,560 --> 01:01:52,871
I'm gonna get my millionth sprocket
if I have to do it myself.

840
01:01:59,400 --> 01:02:00,720
[grunts]

841
01:02:01,320 --> 01:02:04,597
How dare you, you pile of bolts.

842
01:02:04,760 --> 01:02:07,479
You don't understand, there's...

843
01:02:07,800 --> 01:02:11,236
There, that's better.
Nobody pushes Spacely.

844
01:02:21,400 --> 01:02:23,471
[all screaming]

845
01:02:31,360 --> 01:02:34,352
- What's happening?
- Someone's started the plant.

846
01:02:37,800 --> 01:02:39,871
[yelling]

847
01:02:43,680 --> 01:02:45,830
[screaming]

848
01:02:46,920 --> 01:02:49,673
We got to... to... get out of here!

849
01:03:02,080 --> 01:03:06,233
Come on! Come on! Come on!

850
01:03:06,400 --> 01:03:10,792
Oh, no! Squeep! Hang on!

851
01:03:13,520 --> 01:03:15,477
Elroy!

852
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:23,992

Elroy! Oh, thank God you're safe, son.

856
01:03:51,080 --> 01:03:53,276
Oh, Elroy, darling.

857
01:03:53,440 --> 01:03:56,114
I was afraid. I was so afraid.

858
01:03:56,280 --> 01:04:00,194
I'm OK, Mom. I'm OK.
Squeep's OK too.

859
01:04:00,960 --> 01:04:02,155
Thank all of you.

860
01:04:02,320 --> 01:04:05,199
[all] Yay!

861
01:04:05,360 --> 01:04:08,239
Come on, everyone.
We've got to stop the drilling.

862
01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:09,834
Come on!

863
01:04:10,080 --> 01:04:14,119
I never should've put that dummy in
charge of an operation this important.

864
01:04:14,280 --> 01:04:16,794
When I get home,
I'll get a new vice president.

865
01:04:16,960 --> 01:04:19,998
- You've already got a vice president.
- Jeston!

866
01:04:20,160 --> 01:04:23,437
Yes, sir, Mr Spacely.
That dummy, George Jeston.

867
01:04:23,600 --> 01:04:25,352
What do you think you're doing?

868
01:04:25,520 --> 01:04:28,558
Tuning off the plant
before you do any more damage.

869
01:04:28,720 --> 01:04:31,280
Stay away from this button,
that's an order!

870
01:04:31,440 --> 01:04:34,000
No, sir, Mr Spacely.

871
01:04:34,160 --> 01:04:37,596
- What?
- Isaid, no, sir, Mr Spacely.

872
01:04:37,760 --> 01:04:40,752
- Yay, Daddy!
- By gosh, that felt good.

873
01:04:42,400 --> 01:04:47,600
Mr Spacely, you can't stand in the way
of George Jetson!

874
01:04:47,760 --> 01:04:50,673
Geronimo!

875
01:04:56,880 --> 01:04:58,234
[squeaking]

876
01:05:35,240 --> 01:05:37,197
[belts squeaking]

877
01:05:42,600 --> 01:05:44,432
- That's my George!
- Oh, George!

878
01:05:44,600 --> 01:05:45,874
[Elroy] Yay, Dad!

879
01:05:48,640 --> 01:05:50,438
What's gotten into you, Jetson?

880
01:05:50,600 --> 01:05:52,796
There better be an explanation for this.

881
01:05:52,960 --> 01:05:54,758
Oh, there is, all right.

882
01:05:54,920 --> 01:05:58,629
Did you know about these
wonderful little creatures, Mr Spacely,

883
01:05:58,800 --> 01:06:01,076
when you decided to mine this asteroid?

884
01:06:01,800 --> 01:06:04,872
- What creatures, Jetson?
- These creatures.

885
01:06:05,040 --> 01:06:06,678
These wonderful creatures.

886
01:06:06,840 --> 01:06:09,878
You money-grabbing,
insensitive, lying old goat!

887
01:06:10,040 --> 01:06:12,077
You did, didn't you?

888
01:06:12,240 --> 01:06:15,312
Well, I may have heard
something about...

889
01:06:15,480 --> 01:06:18,836
You heard. All you care about is money.

890
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:20,957
- Yeah!
- But they're useless.

891
01:06:21,120 --> 01:06:23,999
And I'm here to tell you
they're not one bit useless.

892
01:06:24,160 --> 01:06:27,152
They just saved my boy's life
is what they did.

893
01:06:27,320 --> 01:06:29,311
The Grungees don't mean any harm.

894
01:06:29,480 --> 01:06:33,519
Mr Spacely, this whole planet
is about different kinds of life forms.

895
01:06:33,680 --> 01:06:35,910
Working together
for the good of everyone.

896
01:06:36,080 --> 01:06:39,710
What do you expect me to do?
I can't just close the plant.

897
01:06:39,880 --> 01:06:44,078
Then figure out a way to keep the plant
and let the Grungees have their homes.

898
01:06:44,240 --> 01:06:47,631
Can't you find it in your heart
to reach a compromise?

899
01:06:47,800 --> 01:06:50,314
Think about all the profits you've lost.

900
01:06:53,520 --> 01:06:57,718
But think of all the profits you'd make
if you warked with the Grungees.

901
01:06:57,880 --> 01:07:02,158
- You mean hire all of them?
- No, I mean become partners.

902
01:07:02,320 --> 01:07:06,279
They run the plant and sell you
the sprockets at a fair price.

903
01:07:06,440 --> 01:07:08,317
Fair?

904
01:07:08,480 --> 01:07:11,996
Otherwise, you'll never get
your millionth sprocket.

905
01:07:12,160 --> 01:07:16,870
Ahh! [grumbling]

906
01:07:45,240 --> 01:07:48,870
I don't believe it!
They've doubled production.

907
01:07:49,040 --> 01:07:52,078
[Jane] And they found a way
to recycle the old sprockets.

908
01:07:52,240 --> 01:07:56,029
Now, no one will ever
have to mine this asteroid again.

909
01:07:57,480 --> 01:08:00,632
Nine hundred and ninety-nine thousand,
nine hundred and ninety-nine.

910
01:08:00,800 --> 01:08:04,077
- [ringing, alarm blaring]
- One million.

911
01:08:04,240 --> 01:08:08,473
- Outergalactic?
- The outergalactic-est

912
01:08:08,640 --> 01:08:10,472
[all cheering]

913
01:08:10,640 --> 01:08:11,994
[both] Yeah!

914
01:08:12,160 --> 01:08:13,753
Oh, yeah!

915
01:08:13,920 --> 01:08:17,595
[speaking foreign language]

916
01:08:17,760 --> 01:08:21,116
- What did he say?
- Let's hear it for Mr Spacely.

917
01:08:21,280 --> 01:08:22,918
[all chattering]

918
01:08:23,080 --> 01:08:24,798
[all] Spacely!

919
01:08:24,960 --> 01:08:26,519
I think I'm gonna be sick.

920
01:08:26,680 --> 01:08:29,991
Jetson, I think you've done
quite enough here.

921
01:08:30,160 --> 01:08:33,437
Yes, sir, Mr Spacely.
Will I be getting a promotion?

922
01:08:33,600 --> 01:08:38,037
A promotion? Ha! You're lucky
I'm giving you your old job back.

923
01:08:38,200 --> 01:08:39,838
But what about vice president?

924
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,037
[all grumbling]

925
01:08:43,200 --> 01:08:48,798
All right, all right,
you're a vice president, but no raise!

926
01:08:48,960 --> 01:08:52,271
- Does this mean we have to leave?
- Well, yes, son.

927
01:08:52,440 --> 01:08:54,511
With the Grungees running the plant,

928
01:08:54,680 --> 01:08:57,911
Spacely Sprockets doesn't
need me here anymore.

929
01:09:04,320 --> 01:09:07,392
Well, I guess its good...
goodbye, Apollo.

930
01:09:07,560 --> 01:09:10,871
Hey, it's OK.
I'll come visit, I promise.

931
01:09:11,040 --> 01:09:14,237
In the meantime, here's the demo
of the song I wrote for us.

932
01:09:14,400 --> 01:09:18,359
- Oh, Apollo.
- Some dude might turn it into a hit.

933
01:09:18,520 --> 01:09:20,431
Maybe Cosmic Cosmo?

934
01:09:20,600 --> 01:09:25,800
Uh-uh. This is ours. Just ours. Always.

935
01:09:25,960 --> 01:09:28,270
[cheering]

936
01:09:31,680 --> 01:09:35,674
[Grungees chattering]

937
01:09:35,920 --> 01:09:39,959
Hey, your friends are calling.

938
01:09:40,840 --> 01:09:44,310
- Elroy.
- See you, Squeep.

939
01:09:44,480 --> 01:09:47,632
Can I use that move of yours,
the Elroy Elevator?

940
01:09:47,800 --> 01:09:52,715
Didn't do me much good,
but sure, if you want to.

941
01:09:52,880 --> 01:09:55,520
Maybe someday we'll
play on the same team.

942
01:09:55,680 --> 01:09:58,240
We already have. And we won.

943
01:09:59,760 --> 01:10:02,718
I'm gonna miss this place a lot.

944
01:10:02,880 --> 01:10:07,078
It shows that you can make friends and
prove yourself anywhere in the universe.

945
01:10:07,240 --> 01:10:10,471
I know, Dad. But leaving's still hard.

946
01:10:10,640 --> 01:10:14,315
Yeah, it is. I know.

947
01:10:14,480 --> 01:10:15,959
[all chattering]

948
01:10:16,120 --> 01:10:19,238
Goodbye! Thank you for everything.

949
01:10:19,400 --> 01:10:23,473
Goodbye, George. And lots of luck.

950
01:10:23,640 --> 01:10:25,916
Thanks. Goodbye.

951
01:10:26,880 --> 01:10:29,759
Lots of luck. See ya!

952
01:10:29,920 --> 01:10:32,753
- Bye!
- Bye-bye!

953
01:10:32,920 --> 01:10:36,709
- Where's Fergie?
- Here she is.

954
01:10:40,920 --> 01:10:43,833
- [cooing] Mama.
- Bye-bye.

955
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:47,118
[Tiffany: Home]

956
01:11:05,920 --> 01:11:10,835
Look. Look, Dad. It's the Grungees.

957
01:11:14,440 --> 01:11:17,717
Well, that sure was nice of 'em,
wasn't it?

958
01:11:36,400 --> 01:11:38,994
[XXL: We're the Jetsons
(Jetsons' Rap)]

959
01:18:28,680 --> 01:18:31,479
[Astro] I love you, George.
