00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:12,133
- * My sister's kid
is tattooed *

2
00:00:12,133 --> 00:00:15,200
* From his head
down to his toes *

3
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:17,633
* He claims trouble
follows him *

4
00:00:17,633 --> 00:00:19,633
* Everywhere he goes *

5
00:00:19,633 --> 00:00:21,767
* He's such a lazy,
loafin' *

6
00:00:21,767 --> 00:00:24,300
* Good-for-nothin'
drunken slob *

7
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:25,667
* But still he thinks *

8
00:00:25,667 --> 00:00:29,000
* I oughter give
his sorry ass a job *

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,500
* Yeah, people
and their problems *

10
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:34,067
* Are givin' me a pain *

11
00:00:34,067 --> 00:00:36,333
* People
and their problems *

12
00:00:36,333 --> 00:00:38,067
* Are messin'
with my brain *

13
00:00:38,067 --> 00:00:40,500
* I try to help them some *

14
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:43,067
* But they always
stay the same *

15
00:00:43,067 --> 00:00:45,167
* People and their
problems... *

16
00:00:45,167 --> 00:00:48,233
- Wow, you're all right,
okay?

17
00:00:48,233 --> 00:00:49,700
Thanks for coming out.

18
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:53,933
The great San Francisco,
greatest city, and, uh...

19
00:00:53,933 --> 00:00:56,633
The amazing, uh, Fillmore,

20
00:00:56,633 --> 00:00:59,600
And, uh, you know,
it's unbelievable...

21
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:03,233
It's good to be alive,
you know what I mean?

22
00:01:03,233 --> 00:01:05,500
Isn't it?
That's what I say.

23
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:08,233
That's what I like.

24
00:01:08,233 --> 00:01:11,200
That-- I find that

25
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:14,567
To be the goodest thing
there is,

26
00:01:14,567 --> 00:01:15,967
To be alive.

27
00:01:15,967 --> 00:01:18,233
And, uh, the reason
it's so good

28
00:01:18,233 --> 00:01:20,800
Is because it's so bad
to be dead.

29
00:01:23,433 --> 00:01:27,433
It's not like life's
so fucking great, but...

30
00:01:27,433 --> 00:01:31,200
Compared to being
smothered in Earth.

31
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:35,367
So I'm just--
Every day, I'm happy now.

32
00:01:35,367 --> 00:01:38,500
That's my goal in life
is not to die.

33
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:40,133
Everybody need a goal.

34
00:01:40,133 --> 00:01:43,267
And so that's my New Year's
resolution every year.

35
00:01:43,267 --> 00:01:45,467
I go,
"I'm not gonna die."

36
00:01:49,433 --> 00:01:51,533
I think, actually,
scientists

37
00:01:51,533 --> 00:01:55,200
Should kind of look
into that whole death thing,

38
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,100
Because, uh,

39
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:59,700
They seem to focus
on diseases,

40
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:01,167
And, uh, you know,

41
00:02:01,167 --> 00:02:02,367
I don't give a fuck
about them,

42
00:02:02,367 --> 00:02:04,100
Cause, you know,
the guy'll go,

43
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:05,100
"Hey, you got, uh...

44
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:06,900
"We fixed your,
uh, arthritis."

45
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:08,300
And then you go,
"I'm still gonna die?"

46
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:10,333
They go, "Yeah."

47
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,300
So that, I think,
is the biggest problem.

48
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:18,667
That's why I can't get
behind politicians, you know,

49
00:02:18,667 --> 00:02:19,867
Cause they're always like,

50
00:02:19,867 --> 00:02:22,233
"Our biggest problem today
is unemployment."

51
00:02:22,233 --> 00:02:23,800
And I'm like,
"What about getting old

52
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,400
And sick and dying?"

53
00:02:29,567 --> 00:02:34,067
Then they usher me out
the back way, you know, but...

54
00:02:34,067 --> 00:02:37,067
Seriously, if there was
a politician ever that said,

55
00:02:37,067 --> 00:02:39,333
"By my second term,
there will be no death."

56
00:02:39,333 --> 00:02:41,267
I'd go, "I'm voting
for that fucker."

57
00:02:41,267 --> 00:02:44,200
I'd just give that guy
all my money,

58
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,867
And I'd sit on a chair.

59
00:02:49,833 --> 00:02:52,900
Sometimes, I actually think
I won't die.

60
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:54,067
You ever think that?

61
00:02:54,067 --> 00:02:57,800
You go, "Fuck it,
I'm not dying."

62
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:00,633
But in your mind,
when, you know, you analy--

63
00:03:00,633 --> 00:03:02,700
You realize, you know,
like--

64
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:06,067
Like, you know, my dad died
and my grandfather died

65
00:03:06,067 --> 00:03:07,867
And my great-grandfather died,
you know.

66
00:03:07,867 --> 00:03:09,733
And the guy before him,
I don't know.

67
00:03:09,733 --> 00:03:10,733
Probably died.

68
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:16,700
I think he died.

69
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:20,300
Cause, otherwise,
he'd be on, uh, extra.

70
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:23,267
No, I...

71
00:03:23,267 --> 00:03:26,067
I come from a long line
of death.

72
00:03:26,067 --> 00:03:27,433
That's my point.

73
00:03:27,433 --> 00:03:30,300
That's my point.

74
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:31,767
And so I fear it,
you know.

75
00:03:31,767 --> 00:03:33,733
I fear it a lot.

76
00:03:33,733 --> 00:03:35,400
And I think most of us do,
you know,

77
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,700
But it's funny, like, how--

78
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:39,300
Like, what we fear,
how we're gonna die.

79
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:41,833
It's always the ways we don't
die, you know what I mean.

80
00:03:41,833 --> 00:03:42,967
Like we go, "God damn,

81
00:03:42,967 --> 00:03:45,133
I hope a polar bear
doesn't eat me,"

82
00:03:45,133 --> 00:03:47,467
Or some crazy shit,
you know.

83
00:03:47,467 --> 00:03:49,100
Or I hope a airplane.

84
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:50,833
You know,
I got on a airplane today.

85
00:03:50,833 --> 00:03:52,400
Every time you get
on an airplane, you go,

86
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,733
"I hope I don't die."

87
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:57,067
But you never die
on an airplane.

88
00:03:57,067 --> 00:04:00,200
Ridiculous.

89
00:04:02,067 --> 00:04:05,633
Or you go, "I hope a terrorist
does not attack and kill me.

90
00:04:05,633 --> 00:04:07,067
I hope
that doesn't happen."

91
00:04:07,067 --> 00:04:08,233
You know, you're
always afraid of that,

92
00:04:08,233 --> 00:04:09,833
But you think about it,
what's the odds

93
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:12,433
That a terrorist
will attack and kill you?

94
00:04:12,433 --> 00:04:14,100
You know,
almost zero, you know?

95
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:16,767
But what are the odds that you
will be attacked and killed

96
00:04:16,767 --> 00:04:18,500
By your own heart?

97
00:04:22,467 --> 00:04:26,100
It's probably 100%,
you know, I think.

98
00:04:31,733 --> 00:04:34,767
Heart's not good.

99
00:04:34,767 --> 00:04:37,800
People think it is,
but it isn't.

100
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,067
People like hearts.

101
00:04:39,067 --> 00:04:41,100
They go, "Here's
a valentine's-- A heart."

102
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:45,400
You go, oh.
[laughs weakly]

103
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,433
They go, "That guy's
got a big heart."

104
00:04:47,433 --> 00:04:49,200
I go, "He better
fuckin' watch it then,

105
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:51,900
"'Cause...

106
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:53,267
"Gonna attack and kill him.

107
00:04:53,267 --> 00:04:55,133
I don't know
if he knows that."

108
00:04:58,067 --> 00:05:00,067
That's what got my dad.

109
00:05:00,067 --> 00:05:01,800
His heart attacked
and killed him

110
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,500
When he was lying
on his bed,

111
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:05,700
And, boom,
dead on the floor.

112
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:07,400
You know, they said
it was instantly.

113
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:08,767
And my dad,
he wasn't expecting it.

114
00:05:08,767 --> 00:05:10,967
He was looking for
fuckin' arabs and shit,

115
00:05:10,967 --> 00:05:13,333
And his heart attacked
and killed him.

116
00:05:13,333 --> 00:05:15,833
And he was dead, like,
instantaneously.

117
00:05:15,833 --> 00:05:17,867
And, uh, sad.

118
00:05:17,867 --> 00:05:22,200
We were all sad.

119
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,767
When something
like that happens,

120
00:05:23,767 --> 00:05:25,533
People just try
and make you feel better.

121
00:05:25,533 --> 00:05:26,967
They'll say anything,
you know.

122
00:05:26,967 --> 00:05:28,633
One guy said to me,
"Don't worry, Norm,

123
00:05:28,633 --> 00:05:29,967
"He died in his sleep.

124
00:05:29,967 --> 00:05:31,767
He didn't feel a thing."

125
00:05:31,767 --> 00:05:33,067
And I was like,
"Really?

126
00:05:33,067 --> 00:05:34,633
"When his heart attacked
and killed him,

127
00:05:34,633 --> 00:05:35,967
He didn't--"

128
00:05:38,233 --> 00:05:41,200
Cause I wake up, like,
if my cat walks across my belly.

129
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,700
You know that.

130
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:50,100
I don't know if my dad
was that sound a sleeper.

131
00:05:54,767 --> 00:05:56,600
One guy said,
"He's in a better place."

132
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:59,800
I said,
"He's on the floor...

133
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:02,233
"Dead.

134
00:06:02,233 --> 00:06:04,600
"Earlier, he was alive
on the bed.

135
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:07,367
"Now, with
that tempur-pedic pillow

136
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:09,900
"I bought him
for Christmas, I'm...

137
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:11,267
"I'm no physician,

138
00:06:11,267 --> 00:06:14,100
"But I think that's
the better place over there.

139
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:16,100
On the, uh...
On the bed."

140
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:21,867
Your only chance
if you have a heart attack

141
00:06:21,867 --> 00:06:23,233
Is if they get there
early enough,

142
00:06:23,233 --> 00:06:25,300
They have these things
called defibrillators,

143
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:30,233
And what they do is,
they attack your heart.

144
00:06:30,233 --> 00:06:31,867
Cause that's all
the heart understands

145
00:06:31,867 --> 00:06:34,700
Is violence, you know.

146
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:36,400
And, uh, so they get
there early,

147
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,500
They go, "Aah!"

148
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:39,433
Then your heart's like,
"Aah! Wha--?!

149
00:06:39,433 --> 00:06:42,967
I wasn't gonna kill him."

150
00:06:42,967 --> 00:06:44,667
[laughs]

151
00:06:44,667 --> 00:06:49,867
"Uh, that's-- That's funny
that you thought that.

152
00:06:49,867 --> 00:06:52,700
"I was-- I was just worried
he was eating, uh,

153
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:54,567
Too much eggs and shit."

154
00:07:00,267 --> 00:07:02,600
You can actually get
defibrillators.

155
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,600
Like, I urge you
to get them, you know.

156
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,967
Cause you can get 'em--

157
00:07:05,967 --> 00:07:07,367
I order 'em--
You get 'em,

158
00:07:07,367 --> 00:07:08,800
And then you can teach
your loved ones

159
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,133
How to use them on you.

160
00:07:10,133 --> 00:07:13,067
And they even show how you
use them on yourself,

161
00:07:13,067 --> 00:07:14,800
And, uh, so I sent away
for 'em,

162
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,100
And I'm getting 'em,
and, uh...

163
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:18,367
I'll tell you
what I'm gonna do.

164
00:07:18,367 --> 00:07:19,500
As soon as I get the box,

165
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:24,333
I am going to preemptively
attack my heart.

166
00:07:24,333 --> 00:07:26,667
Like, before it does anything,
I'll just be like, "Aah!"

167
00:07:26,667 --> 00:07:28,267
My heart's like,
"I didn't do anything!"

168
00:07:28,267 --> 00:07:31,567
You go, "Fucking right, son,
and you're not going to.

169
00:07:31,567 --> 00:07:34,567
"On account of I'm carrying
around these fuckers with me

170
00:07:34,567 --> 00:07:37,300
"Wherever I go, so...

171
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:41,133
"I think I'll go
on a roller coaster now and...

172
00:07:41,133 --> 00:07:43,933
Eat a egg."

173
00:07:48,267 --> 00:07:51,867
But that's all
that'll get you-- A heart attack

174
00:07:51,867 --> 00:07:52,900
Or a cancer.

175
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:54,167
That's the other thing,
you know.

176
00:07:54,167 --> 00:07:55,833
My uncle Burt,
he's my great-uncle,

177
00:07:55,833 --> 00:07:57,067
But we call him uncle Burt.

178
00:07:57,067 --> 00:07:58,333
He got bowel cancer now.

179
00:07:58,333 --> 00:08:00,667
He's, uh... He's dying
of it, you know.

180
00:08:00,667 --> 00:08:02,533
And, uh--

181
00:08:02,533 --> 00:08:04,767
Or like, uh,
some people like to say...

182
00:08:04,767 --> 00:08:07,067
Now they--
See, in the old days,

183
00:08:07,067 --> 00:08:09,333
A man could just get sick
and die, you know?

184
00:08:09,333 --> 00:08:13,400
Now they have
to wage a battle,

185
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,100
[laughs] so...

186
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:18,133
So my uncle Burt
is waging a--

187
00:08:18,133 --> 00:08:21,800
A courageous battle,

188
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:24,300
Which I have seen,
cause I go and visit him,

189
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:25,667
And this is the battle.

190
00:08:25,667 --> 00:08:27,800
He's lying
in a hospital bed

191
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:30,700
With a thing in his arm,
watching Matlock on the TV.

192
00:08:32,867 --> 00:08:35,167
The state
of that battle, I--

193
00:08:35,167 --> 00:08:38,967
I got him the box set
of Matlock, and...

194
00:08:41,067 --> 00:08:42,300
But it's not his fault.

195
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:43,367
What the fuck
is he supposed to do?

196
00:08:43,367 --> 00:08:46,400
Go, "I got you!"

197
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:50,967
It's just a black thing
in his bowel.

198
00:08:50,967 --> 00:08:52,500
And the reason
I don't like it is

199
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:54,100
Cause in the old days,
they'd go, "Hey!

200
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:55,767
That old man died."

201
00:08:55,767 --> 00:08:57,733
Now they go, "Hey!

202
00:08:57,733 --> 00:09:02,067
He-- He lost his battle."

203
00:09:02,067 --> 00:09:03,967
That's no way
to end your life.

204
00:09:03,967 --> 00:09:07,867
You know, "What a loser
that guy was.

205
00:09:07,867 --> 00:09:11,133
Last thing he did
was lose."

206
00:09:14,067 --> 00:09:16,567
"He was waging
a brave battle,

207
00:09:16,567 --> 00:09:17,800
"But at the end,

208
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,833
"I guess he got kind of cowardly
was what happened.

209
00:09:19,833 --> 00:09:22,800
"And then, the bowel cancer,
it got brave.

210
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:25,067
"You gotta give it
to the bowel cancer.

211
00:09:25,067 --> 00:09:27,233
You know, they were
in a battle, and then--"

212
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:32,867
What the fuck?

213
00:09:32,867 --> 00:09:34,867
And I'm pretty sure--
I'm not a doctor,

214
00:09:34,867 --> 00:09:38,367
But I'm pretty sure
if the cancer dies--

215
00:09:38,367 --> 00:09:40,800
I mean, if you die,
the cancer also dies

216
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,500
At exactly
the same time.

217
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:44,233
So that, to me,
is not a loss.

218
00:09:44,233 --> 00:09:45,633
That's a draw.

219
00:09:45,633 --> 00:09:47,067
That's a--
You know what I mean?

220
00:09:47,067 --> 00:09:49,367
It's not like fucking

221
00:09:49,367 --> 00:09:50,833
The cancer's gonna jump up
and go,

222
00:09:50,833 --> 00:09:52,300
"Aah, I'm fucking
uncle Burt's wife.

223
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:54,267
"Where is he?

224
00:09:54,267 --> 00:09:56,733
"I won fair and square.

225
00:09:56,733 --> 00:10:00,267
"Is this where he works?

226
00:10:00,267 --> 00:10:03,167
"Hi. Name's Cancer.
Where do I--

227
00:10:03,167 --> 00:10:06,933
"You just show me
to my cubicle.

228
00:10:06,933 --> 00:10:08,467
Bowel.
First name's Bowel."

229
00:10:14,033 --> 00:10:16,467
No, man, I wouldn't have
no brave battle

230
00:10:16,467 --> 00:10:18,100
When I'm fuckin' dyin',
I'll tell you this,

231
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:20,900
Cause I'm not brave.

232
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:22,600
So when the fuckin'
sickle of death

233
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,233
Is over my goddamn neck,

234
00:10:24,233 --> 00:10:25,733
I'm gonna be so cowardly.

235
00:10:25,733 --> 00:10:27,433
I'm-- You know, I'm afraid

236
00:10:27,433 --> 00:10:30,567
Of going on ferris wheels
and shit.

237
00:10:30,567 --> 00:10:32,367
You know?

238
00:10:32,367 --> 00:10:33,833
I'm not gonna be brave.

239
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:35,267
I don't care
how old I am.

240
00:10:35,267 --> 00:10:36,367
I could be 94.

241
00:10:36,367 --> 00:10:39,733
I'll be like,
"Ooh, please, oh!

242
00:10:39,733 --> 00:10:42,967
Take my grandson."

243
00:10:44,667 --> 00:10:49,400
"Oh, he's young and fresh.

244
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:51,733
"I'd gladly make a deal
with the devil

245
00:10:51,733 --> 00:10:53,000
"If there's any--

246
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,600
"I've read that
in literature.

247
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:57,767
Oh, anything, please."

248
00:11:02,933 --> 00:11:06,100
Now, listen, man,
I like the news.

249
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:09,200
You guys like the news?

250
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,867
I always watch the news.

251
00:11:10,867 --> 00:11:12,567
And I'll tell you something
about the news.

252
00:11:12,567 --> 00:11:14,533
I don't understand it.

253
00:11:14,533 --> 00:11:16,800
But for some reason,
I watch it.

254
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,067
I don't even know why,

255
00:11:18,067 --> 00:11:20,433
But, uh, I think
I'm supposed to or something,

256
00:11:20,433 --> 00:11:22,567
So I'll watch it,
and then the guy'll come on,

257
00:11:22,567 --> 00:11:24,833
He'll go,
"Anyways, today, the deficit..."

258
00:11:24,833 --> 00:11:27,467
And I'll go, "Ah ha ha,
I've heard that word."

259
00:11:31,067 --> 00:11:32,467
And the guy goes,

260
00:11:32,467 --> 00:11:37,667
"Today, the Dow Jones/Nasdaq
composite index is, uh, down,"

261
00:11:37,667 --> 00:11:39,667
And then I go,
"Ah, that's not good."

262
00:11:42,333 --> 00:11:46,100
Down.

263
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:48,500
Up. I like when it's up.

264
00:11:49,767 --> 00:11:51,500
That's my opinion
on the...

265
00:11:58,100 --> 00:11:59,867
Seems like
there's too much news,

266
00:11:59,867 --> 00:12:02,567
Like, you know,
cause now they 24-hour news.

267
00:12:02,567 --> 00:12:04,200
Now, when I was
a young boy,

268
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,700
The news was
half a hour.

269
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:07,200
That was the whole news,
you know,

270
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,600
And a guy would come on,
and he'd have a tie,

271
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,267
You know, and shit,
and he would say the news,

272
00:12:12,267 --> 00:12:13,767
And it was
a half a hour long.

273
00:12:13,767 --> 00:12:16,400
Now it's 24 hours long.

274
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:19,467
Now, it turns out
that back in the old days

275
00:12:19,467 --> 00:12:20,733
When it was
only half a hour,

276
00:12:20,733 --> 00:12:22,067
They had it about right.

277
00:12:22,067 --> 00:12:23,900
That's about
all the news there is.

278
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:34,433
Even then, there would
always be, like, a story--

279
00:12:34,433 --> 00:12:36,200
Some fucking story
at the end

280
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,667
About a caribou
or some horseshit,

281
00:12:37,667 --> 00:12:42,067
So there wasn't even enough
to fill the half a hour.

282
00:12:42,067 --> 00:12:44,433
But 24 hours,
way too long.

283
00:12:44,433 --> 00:12:46,200
So they have to keep
repeating the stories

284
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,567
All the time
and everything,

285
00:12:47,567 --> 00:12:49,900
And, uh, you know,
make up stories, you know.

286
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:51,567
They do that a lot,
make up

287
00:12:51,567 --> 00:12:53,767
Things that aren't
really news stories,

288
00:12:53,767 --> 00:12:56,967
But they have to, you know,
fill the 24 hours, you know.

289
00:12:56,967 --> 00:12:59,133
And the one I notice
that they make up a lot,

290
00:12:59,133 --> 00:13:00,900
This is the latest one
I've seen.

291
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:02,767
I see this all the time
on the news.

292
00:13:02,767 --> 00:13:04,300
The newsman will come on,
he'll go...

293
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:06,133
He'll go,
"Good evening, everybody.

294
00:13:06,133 --> 00:13:07,333
This is the newsman."

295
00:13:07,333 --> 00:13:10,500
Whatever he says.
He's not gonna say that.

296
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:13,633
Then he goes,
"Our top story tonight,

297
00:13:13,633 --> 00:13:15,500
A lady has vanished."

298
00:13:19,067 --> 00:13:20,500
That's the story.

299
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,100
And then he goes,
"Let's go outside,

300
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:24,133
Where there's another guy."

301
00:13:24,133 --> 00:13:26,833
So then they cut
to outside.

302
00:13:26,833 --> 00:13:28,567
And then there's
a guy outside,

303
00:13:28,567 --> 00:13:33,233
And he's like, "Hey, listen,
how's it going inside?

304
00:13:33,233 --> 00:13:36,067
"We're outside, and, uh,

305
00:13:36,067 --> 00:13:38,200
"We found out about
this lady that vanished.

306
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,467
"Her name was Janice,

307
00:13:39,467 --> 00:13:41,067
"And they
found her car here

308
00:13:41,067 --> 00:13:42,767
"In the Taco Bell
parking lot,

309
00:13:42,767 --> 00:13:44,500
"And, uh, don't worry
about the car.

310
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:46,367
"It's fine, but, uh...

311
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:49,600
"Can't find
hide nor hair of the lady.

312
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,400
Well, back to you."

313
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:54,867
So then you're watching,

314
00:13:54,867 --> 00:13:56,667
You go, "Well,
I don't give a fuck

315
00:13:56,667 --> 00:13:59,200
On account of I never knew
Janice in the first place."

316
00:14:03,467 --> 00:14:05,900
"Matter of fact,
I'm kind of happy it's Janice

317
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:07,900
And not somebody I know."

318
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:13,467
But then what they do is,

319
00:14:13,467 --> 00:14:16,833
They start telling you
about Janice, you know?

320
00:14:16,833 --> 00:14:18,067
And they go, "Hey, we got--

321
00:14:18,067 --> 00:14:19,800
We found out some cool things
about Janice."

322
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,400
And you're like,
"No, that's cool.

323
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:22,500
I don't want to hear."

324
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,767
They go, "No, no,
you want to hear."

325
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:26,200
They can't help themselves,

326
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:28,067
So they go,
"Let's go back to Bill.

327
00:14:28,067 --> 00:14:30,333
"He's, uh-- He's, uh,
still outside.

328
00:14:30,333 --> 00:14:32,233
And, uh,
how's it going, Bill?"

329
00:14:32,233 --> 00:14:33,767
And Bill's like,
"It's all right.

330
00:14:33,767 --> 00:14:35,400
"It's no inside,
but it's cool.

331
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:37,867
"And, uh...

332
00:14:37,867 --> 00:14:40,400
"Anyways, we found out
about Janice.

333
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:43,433
"Turns out
she's a good lady,

334
00:14:43,433 --> 00:14:45,167
"And, uh, we found
some friends of hers,

335
00:14:45,167 --> 00:14:46,533
And here they are."

336
00:14:46,533 --> 00:14:48,433
And then, sure enough,
they show a lady

337
00:14:48,433 --> 00:14:50,233
And it says,
"Friend of Janice."

338
00:14:50,233 --> 00:14:51,733
And, uh, she says,

339
00:14:51,733 --> 00:14:53,067
"I'll tell you something
about Janice.

340
00:14:53,067 --> 00:14:54,733
"You want to hear
about Janice?

341
00:14:54,733 --> 00:14:56,067
"Janice is the type of lady

342
00:14:56,067 --> 00:14:57,500
"That you could
always turn to.

343
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,733
"You know, you ever
want to turn to somebody?

344
00:14:59,733 --> 00:15:02,100
"Like, if you got
a problem or something,

345
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:04,533
And you know how you feel
like you want to turn?"

346
00:15:05,867 --> 00:15:07,767
"You ever do that?

347
00:15:07,767 --> 00:15:09,400
"Or maybe
your neck just hurts

348
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:11,867
"And you want to anyways.
The point of it is

349
00:15:11,867 --> 00:15:14,667
"That once you swiveled
your head over this way,

350
00:15:14,667 --> 00:15:16,433
"The person you'd
most want to see

351
00:15:16,433 --> 00:15:19,600
In your eye line
would be Janice."

352
00:15:21,133 --> 00:15:23,567
And then they have
another friend of Janice

353
00:15:23,567 --> 00:15:25,067
That wasn't the first one,
and she'll go,

354
00:15:25,067 --> 00:15:27,333
"I'll tell you Janice,
oh, my God.

355
00:15:27,333 --> 00:15:28,900
"She was the type of lady

356
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:30,467
"That she could
walk into a room

357
00:15:30,467 --> 00:15:32,967
"And light up the whole room,
you know?

358
00:15:32,967 --> 00:15:35,367
"She didn't have a fucking light
or nothin' like that.

359
00:15:35,367 --> 00:15:39,067
"She would just somehow,

360
00:15:39,067 --> 00:15:44,067
"Through sheer tyranny of will,
she could somehow

361
00:15:44,067 --> 00:15:47,367
Illuminate a room.
I don't know how."

362
00:15:47,367 --> 00:15:49,667
And there'll be
Janice's third friend lady

363
00:15:49,667 --> 00:15:51,067
That's not
one of the earlier two,

364
00:15:51,067 --> 00:15:52,067
And then she goes,

365
00:15:52,067 --> 00:15:53,267
"I'll tell you
about Janice.

366
00:15:53,267 --> 00:15:56,200
"Is that who you're
asking me about, Janice?

367
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:58,100
"Janice was
the type of lady

368
00:15:58,100 --> 00:15:59,433
"That you could be talking

369
00:15:59,433 --> 00:16:01,267
"To your best friend
in the whole world,

370
00:16:01,267 --> 00:16:02,833
"And then Janice come in
and you go,

371
00:16:02,833 --> 00:16:05,600
Fuck you,
I'm talking to Janice.'"

372
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,533
"'Cause Janice
is better than you.

373
00:16:07,533 --> 00:16:09,200
"'Come on, let's face it.

374
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:12,133
She's better
than all of us.'"

375
00:16:12,133 --> 00:16:14,333
So anyways,
then you're at home,

376
00:16:14,333 --> 00:16:16,833
And you start liking Janice,
you know what I mean?

377
00:16:16,833 --> 00:16:18,100
You start getting
invested in her.

378
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:21,333
You go, "God damn, that Janice
is a cool lady.

379
00:16:21,333 --> 00:16:22,900
"I would like
to meet her one day.

380
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:24,067
"That would be a lot of--

381
00:16:24,067 --> 00:16:25,633
Fuck, I forgot
she vanished."

382
00:16:28,267 --> 00:16:29,967
"Ah, just my luck."

383
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:39,800
"They'll find her."

384
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,867
Then you get hope.

385
00:16:41,867 --> 00:16:42,967
That's not good.

386
00:16:42,967 --> 00:16:44,567
I don't give a fuck
what Obama says,

387
00:16:44,567 --> 00:16:47,433
Hope is never good.

388
00:16:47,433 --> 00:16:51,300
Don't try it.
Never works out.

389
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:52,900
So you go...

390
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:55,167
You go, "Oh, man,
they'll find Janice.

391
00:16:55,167 --> 00:16:57,967
"They're putting pictures up
of her on telephone poles.

392
00:16:57,967 --> 00:17:01,967
"I think that worked
once, and..."

393
00:17:01,967 --> 00:17:03,667
And then
the news keeps showing you

394
00:17:03,667 --> 00:17:05,267
More things about Janice,
you know.

395
00:17:05,267 --> 00:17:07,600
And they'll show you, like,
home videos of her.

396
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:09,100
You're like,
"God damn, look at that.

397
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:10,600
She's eating a pizza."

398
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,967
"I like her hair
like that."

399
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:19,600
"They'll find her."

400
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:21,733
And then you become
obsessed with Janice.

401
00:17:21,733 --> 00:17:23,267
It's all you can think of,
you know?

402
00:17:23,267 --> 00:17:25,333
You're at work,
fucking just can't wait

403
00:17:25,333 --> 00:17:28,233
To get home, agonizing
over Janice, you know,

404
00:17:28,233 --> 00:17:31,600
And thinking about her
eating pizza and shit.

405
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,533
And then you go home,

406
00:17:33,533 --> 00:17:36,333
And your nights
are just fevered dreams

407
00:17:36,333 --> 00:17:42,067
Of, you know, Janice
and bangs and shit like that.

408
00:17:42,067 --> 00:17:45,900
And all you can do
is turn on the TV and hope,

409
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:48,100
And, you know...
And then one day, you know,

410
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:49,800
They go, "Hey,
more news on Janice.

411
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:51,167
Here's Bill.
He still outside."

412
00:17:51,167 --> 00:17:52,833
And then Bill
is, like, outside,

413
00:17:52,833 --> 00:17:54,367
And he's like,
"Here we are.

414
00:17:54,367 --> 00:17:56,700
"Uh, as you can see
behind me,

415
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:58,400
"They are scouring
the woods.

416
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,667
They're still searching
for Janice," you know.

417
00:18:00,667 --> 00:18:03,067
And then, you go,
"Oh, fuck, not the woods.

418
00:18:03,067 --> 00:18:03,933
You know,
that's not--"

419
00:18:08,433 --> 00:18:12,067
Nothing good
ever happens in the woods.

420
00:18:12,067 --> 00:18:15,400
I've seen enough of
these fucking stories to know

421
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:18,267
That Janice ain't coming
bounding out of the woods

422
00:18:18,267 --> 00:18:21,100
Any time soon,
I'll tell you that.

423
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:23,667
She's like, "Hey!
What's going on, everybody?

424
00:18:23,667 --> 00:18:26,433
I-- I was just taking
a stroll through the woods."

425
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:30,300
"What are you taking
my picture for?

426
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:32,633
"I was just--

427
00:18:32,633 --> 00:18:35,700
Just decided to take a stroll
through the scraggly woods."

428
00:18:39,167 --> 00:18:41,633
No, if they find you
in the woods,

429
00:18:41,633 --> 00:18:44,067
They always find you
in the same place.

430
00:18:44,067 --> 00:18:46,500
Every time,
they will find you

431
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:49,167
In a, uh, shallow grave.

432
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:58,300
I don't know why they don't just
look there in the first place.

433
00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:00,633
That's--
If I was the police chief,

434
00:19:00,633 --> 00:19:03,100
I'd go, "Listen,
I want every shallow grave

435
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:05,667
"In the vicinity
checked out.

436
00:19:05,667 --> 00:19:07,767
"I want to clear up
this case by Tuesday

437
00:19:07,767 --> 00:19:09,567
"On account of

438
00:19:09,567 --> 00:19:12,267
I'm running for D.A.,
or whatever."

439
00:19:12,267 --> 00:19:13,800
But, uh...

440
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:19,400
Doesn't "Shallow grave"
Seem a might rash?

441
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:20,800
You know, if--

442
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:23,300
Like, these serial killers
are supposed to be so shrewd

443
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:25,100
And cunning and everything,
you know.

444
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:27,433
At least according
to the TV movies I've seen.

445
00:19:27,433 --> 00:19:30,067
And, uh, but
then when it comes time

446
00:19:30,067 --> 00:19:33,067
For the grave,

447
00:19:33,067 --> 00:19:35,567
They get a little hasty,
you know.

448
00:19:37,533 --> 00:19:39,233
"Here you go--
Three twigs and a leaf.

449
00:19:39,233 --> 00:19:41,067
"That ought to do it.

450
00:19:41,067 --> 00:19:44,633
"That doesn't look
like Janice anymore.

451
00:19:44,633 --> 00:19:46,233
"Don't recall
Janice ever wearing

452
00:19:46,233 --> 00:19:47,933
"Three leaves and a twig.

453
00:19:47,933 --> 00:19:50,233
"Oh, well,
guess I'll go home

454
00:19:50,233 --> 00:19:52,733
And await
the authorities now."

455
00:19:55,167 --> 00:19:57,467
You gotta prepare
these things, you know?

456
00:19:57,467 --> 00:19:59,700
You gotta be a little
smarter than that.

457
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:01,067
You know, what I would do,

458
00:20:01,067 --> 00:20:06,733
And I would never, ever
kill a lady in cold blood...

459
00:20:06,733 --> 00:20:08,433
[cheers and applause]

460
00:20:08,433 --> 00:20:09,800
I wouldn't!

461
00:20:11,233 --> 00:20:14,500
I know I say that now.
I don't really know.

462
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:15,700
I can't predict the future.

463
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:19,600
But I don't believe I...

464
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:22,333
I know there's
no river long enough

465
00:20:22,333 --> 00:20:23,400
Doesn't contain a bend.

466
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:26,267
But I believe that,
right now...

467
00:20:26,267 --> 00:20:27,467
And it might just
be vanity--

468
00:20:27,467 --> 00:20:28,733
I don't think I would, uh,

469
00:20:28,733 --> 00:20:31,000
I would kill a woman
in cold blood.

470
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:35,633
But if I did, I would plan it
out very carefully, you know?

471
00:20:35,633 --> 00:20:37,400
Cause there's a lot at stake.

472
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:39,733
You know, you think about it,
you probably, you know...

473
00:20:39,733 --> 00:20:41,933
Probably lose your job.
I don't know what happens.

474
00:20:44,333 --> 00:20:47,567
That's a blemish
on the old C.V., you know?

475
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,567
Even in today's
enlightened society,

476
00:20:54,567 --> 00:20:58,667
There remains a stigma
to being a psycho-sexual sadist.

477
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:04,833
But, uh...

478
00:21:04,833 --> 00:21:07,300
What I would do
is I would, like,

479
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:09,400
I would look at the la--
I would select a lady,

480
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:10,833
And then I would follow
her habits.

481
00:21:10,833 --> 00:21:13,167
You understand
what I'm saying?

482
00:21:13,167 --> 00:21:15,833
Like, I would watch her
very carefully, you know?

483
00:21:15,833 --> 00:21:18,633
And I'd go, "Hey!
I notice that every day,

484
00:21:18,633 --> 00:21:20,400
"She goes to that
cheese sandwich shop,

485
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:23,900
"And then she comes out
with a little paper bag.

486
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:26,133
I'll bet you anything there's
cheese sandwiches in there."

487
00:21:26,133 --> 00:21:27,433
You know?

488
00:21:27,433 --> 00:21:30,367
So then I keep that
in my head, you understand.

489
00:21:30,367 --> 00:21:31,733
Then I'd say, "Hey!

490
00:21:31,733 --> 00:21:34,433
"I notice every
Wednesday evening,

491
00:21:34,433 --> 00:21:37,233
"She goes with
her other lady friends,

492
00:21:37,233 --> 00:21:39,300
"And they go down
to the YWCA

493
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:41,167
And they play basketball
with each other."

494
00:21:41,167 --> 00:21:44,300
Which is fine nowadays.
You know?

495
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:47,467
So what I would do is,

496
00:21:47,467 --> 00:21:52,067
On Wednesday,
I would go down to the YWCA.

497
00:21:52,067 --> 00:21:55,167
And what would I be holding

498
00:21:55,167 --> 00:21:57,833
In my right hand
in the parking lot

499
00:21:57,833 --> 00:22:00,800
But a cheese sandwich?

500
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:04,433
So then she would eventually
come out of the YWCA,

501
00:22:04,433 --> 00:22:06,700
You know, all sweaty
with her, uh, you know,

502
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:09,333
Her ridiculous, three-colored
ball and everything there.

503
00:22:09,333 --> 00:22:11,967
You know, and...
I'd be standing there.

504
00:22:11,967 --> 00:22:13,467
[laughter and applause]

505
00:22:13,467 --> 00:22:15,900
And then she'd go, "Hey,
what's in your right hand?"

506
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:17,900
And I'd go, "Nothin'."
I'd be coy, you know.

507
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:19,700
And she'd go...

508
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:21,233
She'd go, "There's something
in your right hand."

509
00:22:21,233 --> 00:22:22,900
I'd go, "Listen, lady...

510
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:25,900
"Who knows more about
what's in their right hand,

511
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:27,633
"You or me?
I believe--

512
00:22:27,633 --> 00:22:29,900
"Oh, this!

513
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:32,367
"No, this is just
a cheese sandwich.

514
00:22:32,367 --> 00:22:36,200
"Why, you like 'em
or something? What's...

515
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:40,900
"I got a whole fucking van
full of 'em over there.

516
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:43,133
"Right over there.

517
00:22:43,133 --> 00:22:46,200
"Yeah. Yeah, that craziest-
lookin' fucking van

518
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:48,133
"You ever saw...

519
00:22:48,133 --> 00:22:49,833
That's filled
with cheese sandwiches."

520
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:58,900
You don't have to have
cheese sandwiches

521
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:01,967
In the van, by the way,
if you're...

522
00:23:01,967 --> 00:23:02,900
You know.

523
00:23:06,367 --> 00:23:08,967
Unless you want to be known
for your detailed work,

524
00:23:08,967 --> 00:23:09,967
It's not...

525
00:23:09,967 --> 00:23:11,667
It's not really necessary.

526
00:23:11,667 --> 00:23:13,967
Then I would get
the lady in the van,

527
00:23:13,967 --> 00:23:16,400
And I would drive her
to a remote area,

528
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,567
An area...

529
00:23:18,567 --> 00:23:20,533
Most known
for its remoteness.

530
00:23:20,533 --> 00:23:21,867
That's what
I would look for.

531
00:23:21,867 --> 00:23:24,467
And anyways, I'd take her
to the remote area,

532
00:23:24,467 --> 00:23:26,767
Where I'd constructed a shed,

533
00:23:26,767 --> 00:23:28,967
And then I would get her
in there,

534
00:23:28,967 --> 00:23:32,400
And I would do that thing
that makes me feel like God.

535
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:35,500
And, uh...

536
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:39,800
And then her screams would just
bounce off the walls

537
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:43,700
And echo out into nowhere
and never...

538
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:46,367
Touch the ear
of civilized man again.

539
00:23:46,367 --> 00:23:49,600
And then I would take
her body to the woods,

540
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:53,967
And bury her in a very,
very, very deep grave.

541
00:23:53,967 --> 00:23:56,767
[laughter and applause]

542
00:23:56,767 --> 00:23:57,900
That's...

543
00:24:00,133 --> 00:24:02,633
That would be
most of my preparation.

544
00:24:02,633 --> 00:24:04,200
I would start
digging the grave

545
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:06,067
Before I chose
the victim.

546
00:24:06,067 --> 00:24:07,167
Couple of years before,

547
00:24:07,167 --> 00:24:09,633
I'd be out
digging a grave.

548
00:24:15,367 --> 00:24:16,667
But, no, listen...

549
00:24:19,067 --> 00:24:23,800
Enough of this grimness.

550
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:25,567
Although my buddy--
I did want to say one thing

551
00:24:25,567 --> 00:24:28,233
About my buddy Richie,
who has a disease.

552
00:24:28,233 --> 00:24:30,233
And, uh, but it's--

553
00:24:30,233 --> 00:24:32,067
It's an interesting disease
he has.

554
00:24:32,067 --> 00:24:34,800
He has the disease
of alcoholism.

555
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:36,400
Alcoholism.

556
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,933
And, uh, he came to me,
you know,

557
00:24:37,933 --> 00:24:40,367
And he told me, and, uh,
I like to look--

558
00:24:40,367 --> 00:24:41,467
I'm the kind of guy
that likes to look

559
00:24:41,467 --> 00:24:42,967
At the bright side
of things, you know?

560
00:24:42,967 --> 00:24:45,367
So I told him, I said,
"Richie, it's true

561
00:24:45,367 --> 00:24:47,367
"That you have a disease
and everything.

562
00:24:47,367 --> 00:24:50,300
But... I think you got
the best one."

563
00:24:56,367 --> 00:24:57,933
It's the only disease
where you

564
00:24:57,933 --> 00:25:00,067
Get to drink booze
all the time.

565
00:25:00,067 --> 00:25:03,333
I-- I haven't looked
at every medical journal,

566
00:25:03,333 --> 00:25:05,867
But I believe...

567
00:25:05,867 --> 00:25:09,367
It's the only disease where
you can constantly drink booze.

568
00:25:11,433 --> 00:25:14,733
As a matter of fact,
that is the disease.

569
00:25:17,767 --> 00:25:19,300
You know, and I don't
think Richie

570
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:20,700
Would think if he had a--

571
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:22,433
Like, I don't think Richie
would go to my uncle Burt

572
00:25:22,433 --> 00:25:24,767
And go, "Hey, I understand
you got bowel cancer.

573
00:25:24,767 --> 00:25:26,733
"Yeah, man,
I know how you feel.

574
00:25:26,733 --> 00:25:28,833
"I gotta...
Drink a lot of booze.

575
00:25:28,833 --> 00:25:30,567
"Those diseases...

576
00:25:30,567 --> 00:25:34,867
"They're tough, those diseases,
huh, uncle Burt?

577
00:25:34,867 --> 00:25:36,867
Hey, what's your symptoms,
uncle Burt?"

578
00:25:36,867 --> 00:25:40,600
"Well, my bowel, I got blood
pouring out of it all the time.

579
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:44,867
"I got bowel blood pourin' out,
gushin' out of my bowel,

580
00:25:44,867 --> 00:25:46,333
"Almost nonstop.

581
00:25:46,333 --> 00:25:50,333
"And, uh, I got searing,
clawing pains,

582
00:25:50,333 --> 00:25:53,333
"Ripping, tearing, you know.

583
00:25:53,333 --> 00:25:58,333
"Uh... Mind-screeching...
Bowel pains.

584
00:25:58,333 --> 00:26:03,333
"And, uh, they're combined
with aching, dull,

585
00:26:03,333 --> 00:26:05,667
Soul-deadening bowel pain."

586
00:26:07,833 --> 00:26:09,933
"Those are basically
my symptoms. How about you?"

587
00:26:09,933 --> 00:26:11,333
"I get happy."

588
00:26:13,833 --> 00:26:15,833
"And, uh, you know.

589
00:26:15,833 --> 00:26:18,733
"I tend to be able to talk
to people easier, I find."

590
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:26,400
"Sometimes, I will
meet a lady at a bar,

591
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:29,167
"Got the same disease
as I do,

592
00:26:29,167 --> 00:26:31,700
"And I'll fuck her.

593
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:35,400
"But, uh...

594
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:38,300
"That's in the latter stages
of the disease,

595
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:42,067
"Uncle Burt.
You ought to realize that.

596
00:26:42,067 --> 00:26:43,633
You know
what I mean, uncle Burt?"

597
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:49,500
But, uh...
No, but, listen, man,

598
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:50,967
I don't minimize
what he does, though,

599
00:26:50,967 --> 00:26:52,467
Cause he's...
He, you know,

600
00:26:52,467 --> 00:26:54,133
He admits that he's
a alcoholic

601
00:26:54,133 --> 00:26:55,333
And that he's weaker
than a bottle,

602
00:26:55,333 --> 00:26:56,400
And that ain't easy
to do.

603
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,700
I couldn't do
any of that shit.

604
00:26:57,700 --> 00:26:59,233
I'm too proud,
you know what I mean.

605
00:26:59,233 --> 00:27:00,633
I got too much pride,
you know.

606
00:27:00,633 --> 00:27:02,400
Like they say
in the scriptures,

607
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:04,633
"Pride goeth
before the fall," you know.

608
00:27:04,633 --> 00:27:06,200
And he can somehow...

609
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:08,900
You know, it's
a very beautiful thing he does.

610
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:10,667
He goes to
alcoholics anonymous,

611
00:27:10,667 --> 00:27:13,167
And he says, right in front
of them, he says--

612
00:27:13,167 --> 00:27:15,067
You know, he goes in front
of a whole room full of people,

613
00:27:15,067 --> 00:27:17,167
And he says, "I am a alcoholic,"
You know?

614
00:27:17,167 --> 00:27:20,667
Which I know does not sound
that anonymous.

615
00:27:20,667 --> 00:27:22,300
But...

616
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:26,067
I didn't
name the group, but...

617
00:27:26,067 --> 00:27:29,300
Sounds like the exact opposite
of anonymous.

618
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:31,067
Whatever.

619
00:27:33,933 --> 00:27:36,067
Like, to me,
the alcoholics that--

620
00:27:36,067 --> 00:27:38,933
You know, the anonymous
alcoholics to me

621
00:27:38,933 --> 00:27:42,067
Would be like you guys.
I don't fucking know, I...

622
00:27:42,067 --> 00:27:44,667
I can't tell.
You know?

623
00:27:44,667 --> 00:27:48,300
But once you tell a whole
church basement full of people,

624
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:50,800
Your cover's
pretty well blown.

625
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:52,167
But, uh...

626
00:27:52,167 --> 00:27:54,833
Anyways, it still requires
a lot of...

627
00:27:54,833 --> 00:27:56,800
The only thing they seem
to be anonymous about,

628
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,233
From the way
I can gather it,

629
00:27:58,233 --> 00:28:00,667
Is they won't tell you
their last names.

630
00:28:00,667 --> 00:28:02,367
Anything else goes,
you know?

631
00:28:02,367 --> 00:28:05,167
But, uh, not the last name.
Oh, no.

632
00:28:05,167 --> 00:28:06,600
Sometimes,
they'll say the first--

633
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:08,433
Like they'll go, "I am Richie,
and I am a alcoholic."

634
00:28:08,433 --> 00:28:09,667
Or the first initial.

635
00:28:09,667 --> 00:28:12,067
They'll say, "Hi, my name
is Richie K.,

636
00:28:12,067 --> 00:28:13,233
And I am a alcoholic."

637
00:28:13,233 --> 00:28:14,367
Then anything goes.

638
00:28:14,367 --> 00:28:17,100
They're like, "Ah ha ha,
one time I, uh,

639
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:20,367
"I remember I was under the
influence of the demon rum,

640
00:28:20,367 --> 00:28:22,700
"And, uh...

641
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:28,367
"By God I started punching
my newborn in the face.

642
00:28:28,367 --> 00:28:32,100
"Ah ha, yeah, it was...

643
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:33,700
"Then I looked down
at my fist,

644
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:36,233
"And it was all bloody
with, uh...

645
00:28:36,233 --> 00:28:37,267
"I don't know what it was.

646
00:28:37,267 --> 00:28:38,767
"It was either
from my knuckles

647
00:28:38,767 --> 00:28:42,367
"Or my son's skull.

648
00:28:42,367 --> 00:28:45,067
"Yeah.

649
00:28:45,067 --> 00:28:46,900
"I'm not telling you
my last name.

650
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:49,233
"That's...

651
00:28:49,233 --> 00:28:51,367
"That's none
of your beeswax.

652
00:28:51,367 --> 00:28:53,367
"As far as I'm concerned,

653
00:28:53,367 --> 00:28:57,367
"A man should have a little,
you know...

654
00:28:57,367 --> 00:28:58,733
"Did I ever tell you
about the time

655
00:28:58,733 --> 00:29:00,967
"I blew a dog
for a pint of gin?

656
00:29:00,967 --> 00:29:02,833
"I ever tell you that story?

657
00:29:02,833 --> 00:29:04,967
Oh, yeah, I told--
I did tell you that one?"

658
00:29:07,267 --> 00:29:10,433
"First initial's 'K',
I'll give you that much.

659
00:29:10,433 --> 00:29:15,067
"Richie K., but I'm not gonna
tell you the last letters.

660
00:29:15,067 --> 00:29:16,333
"Plus, you can
memorize my face.

661
00:29:16,333 --> 00:29:18,767
"But other than that...

662
00:29:18,767 --> 00:29:22,167
"I would like to keep this
completely anonymous.

663
00:29:22,167 --> 00:29:23,900
If there was just a way
I could..."

664
00:29:28,733 --> 00:29:30,700
And what better way
to keep a secret,

665
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:31,900
When you think about it,

666
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:36,067
Than tell a room
full of drunks?

667
00:29:36,067 --> 00:29:37,867
That's not going anyplace,
you know.

668
00:29:40,633 --> 00:29:42,067
Soon as the guy
has a relapse,

669
00:29:42,067 --> 00:29:44,833
"Hey, Richie blew a dog
for a pint of gin.

670
00:29:44,833 --> 00:29:48,233
He told
a whole bunch of us."

671
00:29:48,233 --> 00:29:51,100
All right.

672
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:52,867
I mean, I understand,
the dog had some gin.

673
00:29:52,867 --> 00:29:54,500
What are you gonna do?

674
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:57,200
"Oh, yeah, Richie K.
You know Richie K.?"

675
00:30:03,433 --> 00:30:06,300
But I don't drink myself,
you know.

676
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:08,133
It's not 'cause I'm no big--
I'm just afraid.

677
00:30:08,133 --> 00:30:09,867
You know, I fear everything,
you know.

678
00:30:09,867 --> 00:30:12,533
And, uh, so I'm afraid to
and stuff.

679
00:30:12,533 --> 00:30:14,633
But, um... I used to.

680
00:30:14,633 --> 00:30:15,700
Now I don't drink,

681
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:17,433
And when you're
with people that drink,

682
00:30:17,433 --> 00:30:18,700
It doesn't work out.

683
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:20,700
That's why
that designated driver thing

684
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:22,100
I don't think
ever worked out.

685
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:23,700
I see ads
for it again,

686
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:25,767
Like, you know, trying
to resurrect that idea,

687
00:30:25,767 --> 00:30:30,867
But it's kind
of a flawed notion, you know?

688
00:30:30,867 --> 00:30:32,767
It's like,
"Hey, Bill, listen,

689
00:30:32,767 --> 00:30:35,167
"We were wondering
if you'd come out with us.

690
00:30:35,167 --> 00:30:36,900
Here's the idea."

691
00:30:39,333 --> 00:30:41,800
"We want to go out
and drink,

692
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:43,867
"And then we were hoping
you'd come with us

693
00:30:43,867 --> 00:30:46,067
"And not drink.

694
00:30:46,067 --> 00:30:47,933
"How's that sound to you?

695
00:30:47,933 --> 00:30:51,433
"We're gonna go to a bunch
of different bars and drink,

696
00:30:51,433 --> 00:30:55,400
"And then you'd come with us
and not drink.

697
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:58,000
"Also, we're
not gonna be driving.

698
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:02,333
"You're gonna pick us up
at our different houses,

699
00:31:02,333 --> 00:31:04,800
"Go to a bunch of bars,

700
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:06,900
"Not drink while we drink,

701
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:08,133
"And then drive us all home.

702
00:31:08,133 --> 00:31:10,067
"How's that sound to you?
How's--

703
00:31:10,067 --> 00:31:11,800
How's that catch you?"

704
00:31:13,567 --> 00:31:15,600
Guy's like, "I don't know,
what's the catch?

705
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:17,167
It sounds too good."

706
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:21,400
"Is there some sort of..."

707
00:31:26,067 --> 00:31:27,700
But I don't drink,
and if you don't drink,

708
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:29,967
I'll tell you something,
bars are not a lot of fun,

709
00:31:29,967 --> 00:31:32,600
Because, you know,
when you think about it,

710
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:34,700
Fuckin' all--
You know, all it is

711
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:37,767
Is you're just sitting at
a big oak table for four hours.

712
00:31:37,767 --> 00:31:39,133
It's not...

713
00:31:39,133 --> 00:31:41,667
That's not fun
unless you're drunk.

714
00:31:45,067 --> 00:31:47,067
And then everybody else'll
be drinking,

715
00:31:47,067 --> 00:31:48,333
You know what I mean,

716
00:31:48,333 --> 00:31:50,733
So their fun is going
up and up and up, you know.

717
00:31:50,733 --> 00:31:53,067
It's rising.
Their fun is escalating,

718
00:31:53,067 --> 00:31:56,933
While your fun
is staying exactly the same.

719
00:31:56,933 --> 00:31:58,467
And then by the end
of the night,

720
00:31:58,467 --> 00:32:00,633
You don't even know what
the fuck they're laughing about.

721
00:32:00,633 --> 00:32:03,900
Just everybody's laughing.

722
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:05,700
And then they start
resenting you for it.

723
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:07,100
I've seen that, man.

724
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:10,900
Drunk people do not want
a not-drunk guy there.

725
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:13,467
I know that.
I've been there so many times.

726
00:32:13,467 --> 00:32:14,933
It always ends the same.

727
00:32:14,933 --> 00:32:16,067
Guy comes up to you, goes,

728
00:32:16,067 --> 00:32:19,900
"Hey, what's the matter
with you?

729
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:22,467
"Cheer up.

730
00:32:22,467 --> 00:32:24,967
Ahh!"

731
00:32:27,667 --> 00:32:31,900
Then you're like, "Oh, now
I'm having a good time, too.

732
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:36,700
"Don't take a wild swing
at me when I'm not looking.

733
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:40,533
"I'll be driving you home
later.

734
00:32:40,533 --> 00:32:42,433
This is a lot of fun."

735
00:32:47,167 --> 00:32:50,067
Worst thing about
not drinking is, uh,

736
00:32:50,067 --> 00:32:51,500
Is-- Is sex.

737
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:52,900
Because if you're drinking,

738
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:54,600
You can meet a girl,
she'd be drunk,

739
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:57,600
And that very night you can
have sex with her,

740
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:01,067
Called a one-night stand.
Now...

741
00:33:01,067 --> 00:33:02,533
If you're not drinking--

742
00:33:02,533 --> 00:33:04,667
I don't know if you've ever
had a one-night stand

743
00:33:04,667 --> 00:33:08,233
Dead, clean sober...

744
00:33:08,233 --> 00:33:11,200
But I have.

745
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:14,267
And it's not a lot of fun.

746
00:33:15,867 --> 00:33:17,400
Get back to your apartment,
you're like,

747
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:21,267
"All right, I guess I'll take my
trousers off now, ma'am, and...

748
00:33:21,267 --> 00:33:23,067
"No, I won't.
Sorry about that.

749
00:33:23,067 --> 00:33:25,667
"Well, good-bye.
It was nice to meet you.

750
00:33:25,667 --> 00:33:26,767
"I don't know what
I was thinking.

751
00:33:26,767 --> 00:33:28,900
"We're human beings.

752
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:32,533
"Once again, I apologize
for the trousers incident.

753
00:33:32,533 --> 00:33:35,233
Very nice to meet you."

754
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:40,900
Because booze somehow--
I don't know how it works.

755
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:42,800
But it's some magic elixir

756
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:44,867
Where it takes away the--

757
00:33:44,867 --> 00:33:47,600
It makes you think that sex
is not a dirty,

758
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:50,367
Filthy, shameful thing.

759
00:33:50,367 --> 00:33:53,267
I don't know how it does it,
but it does it.

760
00:33:53,267 --> 00:33:55,333
And, uh, in regular life,

761
00:33:55,333 --> 00:33:57,367
That's why sex is so tough
to get going,

762
00:33:57,367 --> 00:34:01,767
Because it's so shameful
and filthy, and, uh...

763
00:34:01,767 --> 00:34:04,333
Obviously meant only
for procreation.

764
00:34:04,333 --> 00:34:06,967
So when you get--
When you get--

765
00:34:06,967 --> 00:34:09,067
When you do it,
you know--

766
00:34:09,067 --> 00:34:10,433
And my friend was like,
"Oh, there's nothing

767
00:34:10,433 --> 00:34:11,533
Shameful about sex."

768
00:34:11,533 --> 00:34:12,800
But I was like,
"Of course there is."

769
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,633
On account of I think about
what you do before sex,

770
00:34:14,633 --> 00:34:16,067
You know what I mean?
Like you--

771
00:34:16,067 --> 00:34:18,767
You take the phone off the hook
and everything like that.

772
00:34:18,767 --> 00:34:20,200
You make sure the kids
aren't around or whatever.

773
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:23,367
You know?
You pull the blinds down, right?

774
00:34:23,367 --> 00:34:27,367
What's that?
That's shame.

775
00:34:27,367 --> 00:34:30,667
That's what blinds
were made for.

776
00:34:30,667 --> 00:34:33,867
Pull down, shame.

777
00:34:33,867 --> 00:34:35,500
You don't
pull the blinds down

778
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:37,400
When you're making
a nice cherry pie

779
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:40,500
For old widow Hamilton, huh?

780
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:43,067
I notice they stay up
for that.

781
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:48,733
Poor old widow Hamilton.

782
00:34:52,067 --> 00:34:54,600
Her osteoarthritis now
has become so bad--

783
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:57,400
I don't know if you know
widow Hamilton, but, uh...

784
00:34:57,400 --> 00:35:02,100
Really, her only joy
in the later years

785
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:04,367
Has become her pies,
and, uh...

786
00:35:04,367 --> 00:35:06,500
Her osteoarthritis
has become so bad,

787
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:08,467
She can't knead anymore.

788
00:35:08,467 --> 00:35:10,900
You know, you have to knead.

789
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:14,167
She's now lost her ability
to knead.

790
00:35:14,167 --> 00:35:15,767
Anyways...

791
00:35:15,767 --> 00:35:19,100
No, I'm just saying, I don't
want to boast or anything,

792
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:20,367
But if it wasn't for me

793
00:35:20,367 --> 00:35:22,200
And some of the other members
of the community,

794
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:26,667
I don't know if the old bird
would still be with us.

795
00:35:26,667 --> 00:35:28,933
But that's not the point.
The point is,

796
00:35:28,933 --> 00:35:32,567
Sex is a filthy,
shameful thing.

797
00:35:32,567 --> 00:35:34,233
And...

798
00:35:34,233 --> 00:35:36,367
Like, all right,
one time, I read this.

799
00:35:36,367 --> 00:35:39,100
This is a thing I read,
uh, uh, by a scientist.

800
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:42,200
It was in one of those
big science books, you know?

801
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:44,200
Or else it was one line
in usa today.

802
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:47,067
I can't remember.
But...

803
00:35:47,067 --> 00:35:49,200
But it said this.
It said,

804
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:51,200
"Scientists now say

805
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:57,067
That a man thinks about sex
once every 7.3 seconds."

806
00:35:57,067 --> 00:35:58,267
Now...

807
00:35:58,267 --> 00:36:00,633
Now, of course,
that's horseshit.

808
00:36:00,633 --> 00:36:04,133
Like, how could that
possibly be, you know?

809
00:36:04,133 --> 00:36:05,333
You couldn't walk
down the street,

810
00:36:05,333 --> 00:36:09,833
"Uh, cock, pussy, ass."

811
00:36:09,833 --> 00:36:11,533
You know, you'd blow
your fucking head off

812
00:36:11,533 --> 00:36:13,600
By the second day.

813
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:15,700
And, also, I am a man.

814
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:18,400
I don't need no scientist
telling me nothin'.

815
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:22,267
I know what I think
once every 7.3 seconds.

816
00:36:22,267 --> 00:36:26,767
Plus, I don't like when
they use decimals like that.

817
00:36:26,767 --> 00:36:28,733
You know,
guy could have said

818
00:36:28,733 --> 00:36:30,367
Once every 10 or 15 seconds.

819
00:36:30,367 --> 00:36:33,300
You know, he had
to prove he was a scientist.

820
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:34,667
But anyways,

821
00:36:34,667 --> 00:36:37,600
I know what I think
once every 7.3 seconds.

822
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:39,300
I'll just be walking
down the street, you know.

823
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:40,467
You just, you know,
you're like,

824
00:36:40,467 --> 00:36:41,700
"Doodley do.
Hey, there's a building.

825
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:43,067
"Doo doo doo dee.

826
00:36:43,067 --> 00:36:44,167
"Hey, look at that.

827
00:36:44,167 --> 00:36:45,467
"Guy wearing cowboy boots
over there.

828
00:36:45,467 --> 00:36:48,067
"How 'bout that? Huh.

829
00:36:48,067 --> 00:36:52,233
"Doodley doo. Wonder if i
should wear cowboy boots.

830
00:36:52,233 --> 00:36:55,067
"Nah, I'm too old
for that stuff.

831
00:36:55,067 --> 00:36:57,600
"Oh, there's
that building again.

832
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:59,400
"Doodley doo.

833
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:03,300
"Hey, my ass is itchy
over here.

834
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:07,133
"I can't scratch my ass
out here in the street.

835
00:37:07,133 --> 00:37:10,167
"Hey, Willie Nnelson
still wears cowboy boots.

836
00:37:10,167 --> 00:37:12,100
"Billy Joe Shaver, too.

837
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:16,333
Those fellas must be
well nigh threescore and ten."

838
00:37:16,333 --> 00:37:18,933
Anyway, it's just a bunch
of meaningless gibberish.

839
00:37:18,933 --> 00:37:20,067
That's my point.

840
00:37:20,067 --> 00:37:22,533
But it's not sex.

841
00:37:22,533 --> 00:37:25,433
And then, the real time--

842
00:37:25,433 --> 00:37:27,533
This is the amount of time
that you think about sex.

843
00:37:27,533 --> 00:37:30,067
Every once in a while.

844
00:37:30,067 --> 00:37:32,133
Which is...
Not a scien--

845
00:37:32,133 --> 00:37:35,267
Scientists don't like
that term.

846
00:37:35,267 --> 00:37:37,500
But every once in a while
you think about it,

847
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:40,333
And, uh, you know,
like, I think about it

848
00:37:40,333 --> 00:37:41,367
Every couple days.

849
00:37:41,367 --> 00:37:42,367
Or if you're a younger man,

850
00:37:42,367 --> 00:37:43,467
You probably
think about it more.

851
00:37:43,467 --> 00:37:44,467
You know what I mean?

852
00:37:44,467 --> 00:37:45,767
But then
the problem becomes,

853
00:37:45,767 --> 00:37:47,067
When you think about it,

854
00:37:47,067 --> 00:37:48,100
It's all
you can think about.

855
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:49,200
You know what I mean?

856
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:51,233
It just encompasses
your whole brain.

857
00:37:51,233 --> 00:37:53,400
You know, you're just like,
"Aah!"

858
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:54,767
You're like a--

859
00:37:54,767 --> 00:37:58,333
Like a fucking werewolf
or something, like...

860
00:37:58,333 --> 00:38:00,767
Usually, you're a civilized
human being.

861
00:38:00,767 --> 00:38:03,233
But then every couple days,
you're like, "Ah hah...

862
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:06,767
Ah hah."

863
00:38:06,767 --> 00:38:09,400
And then you gotta
close the blinds, you know?

864
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:10,467
And then...

865
00:38:10,467 --> 00:38:13,567
[cheers and applause]
"Agh ahh...

866
00:38:13,567 --> 00:38:15,700
"Ahh, the bedroom.
Gotta go back to the bedroom.

867
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:18,567
Agh, take a lady
back there. Agh."

868
00:38:18,567 --> 00:38:20,267
And then you go
to your bedroom,

869
00:38:20,267 --> 00:38:22,267
Which normally,
I love the bedroom.

870
00:38:22,267 --> 00:38:24,867
It's the most beautiful place
where you can, you know,

871
00:38:24,867 --> 00:38:29,633
Finally escape this hellish joke
we call a life, and just...

872
00:38:29,633 --> 00:38:31,600
You know, lie on your
tempur-pedic pillow

873
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:33,167
And, uh...

874
00:38:33,167 --> 00:38:35,867
Dream of jelly rolls
and stuff like that.

875
00:38:35,867 --> 00:38:38,133
But not when you're in this
state, you know what I mean?

876
00:38:38,133 --> 00:38:39,633
Then you go in,
you're like, "Aaghh!"

877
00:38:39,633 --> 00:38:42,467
And the things that you do
in that bedroom...

878
00:38:42,467 --> 00:38:44,600
Good Lord God, it's--

879
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:47,067
It's beyond the imagination

880
00:38:47,067 --> 00:38:49,567
Of you as a civilized
human being most of the time.

881
00:38:49,567 --> 00:38:51,067
You know what I mean?
You're in there, you're like,

882
00:38:51,067 --> 00:38:52,733
"Aahh! Aagh!

883
00:38:52,733 --> 00:38:54,600
"Rahr ah hah!

884
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:58,200
Aghh!"
Your fucking mind's gone.

885
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:03,067
Your mind is gone.
That's all I know.

886
00:39:03,067 --> 00:39:06,233
You ever actually
say things that you're doing?

887
00:39:06,233 --> 00:39:07,767
Your mind's fucking so gone,
you're like,

888
00:39:07,767 --> 00:39:10,133
"I am fucking you!
Aaah!

889
00:39:10,133 --> 00:39:13,500
My cock is going--
Ahh hah!"

890
00:39:18,733 --> 00:39:22,700
And the lady's like,
"Yeah, I know, whatever."

891
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:24,167
"You don't have to say it."

892
00:39:27,733 --> 00:39:29,733
Ladies don't have
that "Aagh" thing.

893
00:39:29,733 --> 00:39:31,233
They're--
They're more elevated.

894
00:39:31,233 --> 00:39:33,800
I don't know what they--
I can't speak for ladies.

895
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:36,067
I don't know
what the fuck they do...

896
00:39:36,067 --> 00:39:37,933
In the bedroom.

897
00:39:37,933 --> 00:39:39,233
I think they just
try and make a noise

898
00:39:39,233 --> 00:39:40,633
They think you will like,
you know?

899
00:39:40,633 --> 00:39:42,267
That's about...

900
00:39:42,267 --> 00:39:43,967
They're like, uh,
"Whoo! How's that?"

901
00:39:43,967 --> 00:39:46,300
You're like,
"Yeah, that's fine. Aaagh!"

902
00:39:51,233 --> 00:39:55,933
But... Girls don't
have the same thing.

903
00:39:55,933 --> 00:39:59,100
You know how you can
really know that,

904
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:01,633
Is, you ever be having sex
with a lady, the phone rings?

905
00:40:01,633 --> 00:40:03,633
Lady can answer the phone.

906
00:40:03,633 --> 00:40:05,367
Whilst you're having sex.

907
00:40:05,367 --> 00:40:06,900
She's like,
"Ooh, yes, that's good.

908
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:08,433
Whatever that is.
Ahh."

909
00:40:08,433 --> 00:40:10,533
And then the phone rings.
She's like, "Hello?"

910
00:40:10,533 --> 00:40:13,167
And you're like, "Aagh."

911
00:40:13,167 --> 00:40:15,133
Just... She's like,
"Oh, hi, marcie.

912
00:40:15,133 --> 00:40:18,633
"What's going on?

913
00:40:18,633 --> 00:40:22,633
[scoffs] "Well, you're
not gonna get it back.

914
00:40:22,633 --> 00:40:26,633
"Because it's Shirley.

915
00:40:26,633 --> 00:40:29,167
"Well, don't--
No, it's not you, honey.

916
00:40:29,167 --> 00:40:34,367
"It's--
You're too good, it's...

917
00:40:34,367 --> 00:40:37,133
"Don't you remember
the blouse?

918
00:40:37,133 --> 00:40:39,367
"Look, sweetie,
I'm on your side.

919
00:40:39,367 --> 00:40:41,367
"I'll talk to you tomorrow.
We'll have a, uh,

920
00:40:41,367 --> 00:40:43,867
"We'll go to lunch,
have a, uh...

921
00:40:43,867 --> 00:40:46,300
Endive salad."
Whatever the fuck.

922
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:48,267
I don't know
what ladies eat.

923
00:40:48,267 --> 00:40:50,033
And then they can go back,
you know, and go, "Go ahead."

924
00:40:50,033 --> 00:40:51,200
You know,
and you're like, "Agh!"

925
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:54,533
But... The point is,
a guy could never--

926
00:40:54,533 --> 00:40:56,100
The guy would never
answer the phone.

927
00:40:56,100 --> 00:40:57,500
It would be impossible,
you know?

928
00:40:57,500 --> 00:40:58,667
You can be like, "Aah!"
The ding-ding.

929
00:40:58,667 --> 00:41:00,367
"Ahh! Hello?
Ahh!

930
00:41:00,367 --> 00:41:02,867
"Oh, yeah. Hey, Frank,
what's going on?

931
00:41:02,867 --> 00:41:04,867
"Yeah, I remember that shirt.
What? I'm about to--

932
00:41:04,867 --> 00:41:07,333
I gotta go!
Aagh!"

933
00:41:07,333 --> 00:41:09,700
You know.

934
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:13,867
Frank's clearly not getting
his shirt back, but...

935
00:41:13,867 --> 00:41:15,867
You got no time for it,
you know?

936
00:41:15,867 --> 00:41:17,633
You got--
Your head's gone.

937
00:41:21,333 --> 00:41:24,400
But I'll tell you when you
know sex is the most shameful,

938
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:26,067
When you feel it the most,

939
00:41:26,067 --> 00:41:30,067
Is a moment after sex...

940
00:41:30,067 --> 00:41:34,433
The moment, the smallest
amount of time in physics,

941
00:41:34,433 --> 00:41:37,067
The moment right after sex.

942
00:41:37,067 --> 00:41:39,667
That's when you're just
a vessel of shame, you know?

943
00:41:39,667 --> 00:41:41,300
It's like... You're just
lying there like,

944
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:43,967
[whimpers]

945
00:41:43,967 --> 00:41:47,267
"Well, that was odd, huh?"

946
00:41:47,267 --> 00:41:49,067
[chuckles]

947
00:41:49,067 --> 00:41:52,333
"I guess I'll go get some sour
cream and onion chips now if..."

948
00:41:55,133 --> 00:41:58,200
"I'd prefer if we never
spoke of this again.

949
00:41:58,200 --> 00:42:00,167
Would that be okay?"

950
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:05,900
That's why I never
understood guys

951
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:07,300
That add more shame to it.

952
00:42:07,300 --> 00:42:08,333
You know what I mean?

953
00:42:08,333 --> 00:42:09,900
As if it's not
shameful enough,

954
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:12,567
Some people will pile on more
shame, you know what I mean?

955
00:42:12,567 --> 00:42:14,700
Like you ever read about
those guys, like they'll...

956
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:16,567
Wear a rubber suit
of some fucking thing.

957
00:42:16,567 --> 00:42:18,500
And a lady'll
whip their balls,

958
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:19,900
Or I don't know
what the fuck.

959
00:42:19,900 --> 00:42:22,667
But... It all ends up
the same, you know.

960
00:42:22,667 --> 00:42:24,367
You're still like,
"Heh heh heh."

961
00:42:24,367 --> 00:42:26,700
But now you got
a crazy getup on.

962
00:42:28,533 --> 00:42:30,900
"All right, then.

963
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:35,133
"Why don't you go turn on
Matlock, and, uh...

964
00:42:35,133 --> 00:42:38,433
"I'll take these
rubber trousers off and...

965
00:42:38,433 --> 00:42:40,167
Put those in the hamper."

966
00:42:46,833 --> 00:42:50,533
So I'm very ashamed of sex
and everything.

967
00:42:50,533 --> 00:42:51,767
Some people
are proud of it, though.

968
00:42:51,767 --> 00:42:54,400
I have met guys that are
proud of their sexual,

969
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:55,900
Like, prowess.

970
00:42:55,900 --> 00:42:58,633
You ever hear that word?
I read that once.

971
00:42:58,633 --> 00:43:01,767
It's, uh, it means like,
how good they are at sex.

972
00:43:01,767 --> 00:43:03,600
They'll pra--
Brag about it.

973
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:05,533
They'll go, "I'll tell you,
man, what I'm good at

974
00:43:05,533 --> 00:43:07,767
Is, you know,
fuckin' and suckin'."

975
00:43:10,533 --> 00:43:13,200
Seems like the oddest
thing, you know.

976
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:15,567
Cause how hard is sex?

977
00:43:15,567 --> 00:43:17,567
You know, it's one
of the easiest things

978
00:43:17,567 --> 00:43:18,767
That you could--

979
00:43:18,767 --> 00:43:22,500
It's not like darts
or something, you know.

980
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:25,467
Have you ever played darts?
It's like, "Ah, what?

981
00:43:25,467 --> 00:43:27,933
"Triple? I can't--

982
00:43:27,933 --> 00:43:32,200
I keep getting four."

983
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:33,667
I don't know, but...

984
00:43:33,667 --> 00:43:36,867
Sex couldn't be simpler.

985
00:43:36,867 --> 00:43:39,200
Hey, there's only like
five things you can do

986
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:40,600
In the whole fucking thing.

987
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:42,400
You know?

988
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:43,867
You ever think
you invented a sixth?

989
00:43:43,867 --> 00:43:46,100
You're like,
"What about this? Aagh!"

990
00:43:48,067 --> 00:43:49,967
Then later, you go,
"Ah, in all humility,

991
00:43:49,967 --> 00:43:52,533
I guess that was
pretty close to number five."

992
00:43:58,533 --> 00:43:59,800
You know who's really--

993
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:02,067
You know who's really
proud of their sex?

994
00:44:02,067 --> 00:44:06,167
You ever hear guys with
small cocks talk about it?

995
00:44:06,167 --> 00:44:07,900
Small cock guys.
Them guys.

996
00:44:07,900 --> 00:44:11,067
Holy Lord.
Can't talk about it enough.

997
00:44:11,067 --> 00:44:13,200
They even got poems.
You know, they'll say,

998
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:15,767
"Ah, it's not the motion
of the ocean,

999
00:44:15,767 --> 00:44:17,700
It's the boat
of the lotion."

1000
00:44:17,700 --> 00:44:19,167
I don't know.

1001
00:44:19,167 --> 00:44:21,900
I don't know the-- I don't
memorize the poems.

1002
00:44:21,900 --> 00:44:23,433
But...

1003
00:44:23,433 --> 00:44:25,367
I've even heard variants
of the same poem.

1004
00:44:25,367 --> 00:44:27,467
It's like, "It's not the tree
or the size,

1005
00:44:27,467 --> 00:44:29,167
It's the ax
that you whacks."

1006
00:44:29,167 --> 00:44:31,067
I don't know.

1007
00:44:31,067 --> 00:44:33,167
But, uh, it's...

1008
00:44:33,167 --> 00:44:34,900
It's a little sub genre
of poetry now

1009
00:44:34,900 --> 00:44:40,067
That's taught in many
of our finer institutions.

1010
00:44:40,067 --> 00:44:42,433
Turns out guys
with small cocks,

1011
00:44:42,433 --> 00:44:43,700
Nothing they like more

1012
00:44:43,700 --> 00:44:45,933
Than just spoutin'
free verse at home

1013
00:44:45,933 --> 00:44:48,167
About their...

1014
00:44:48,167 --> 00:44:50,633
And the...
[chuckling]

1015
00:44:50,633 --> 00:44:54,167
The subtext of every one
of these beautiful poems

1016
00:44:54,167 --> 00:44:57,267
Is, uh, it doesn't matter
how big your cock is,

1017
00:44:57,267 --> 00:44:59,167
It's what you do with it.

1018
00:44:59,167 --> 00:45:02,633
You know?

1019
00:45:02,633 --> 00:45:05,233
Like the guy with the giant cock
would have no clue.

1020
00:45:05,233 --> 00:45:07,900
You know, how would...

1021
00:45:07,900 --> 00:45:11,500
How would he possibly know?

1022
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:14,067
It's like, "What do you do?
You put it in, and then you...

1023
00:45:14,067 --> 00:45:16,100
"I'm stumped.
I don't know."

1024
00:45:17,900 --> 00:45:20,067
"It's ironic-- Everyone
wants my giant cock,

1025
00:45:20,067 --> 00:45:22,533
"But...

1026
00:45:22,533 --> 00:45:25,067
"I don't think
I'll ever solve this...

1027
00:45:25,067 --> 00:45:28,567
"Rubric.
I don't know, I...

1028
00:45:28,567 --> 00:45:32,967
"If only it was smaller
and easier to maneuver, I...

1029
00:45:32,967 --> 00:45:34,500
"I can't--
I can't figure it.

1030
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:35,900
I don't know."

1031
00:45:41,633 --> 00:45:44,300
Oh, man.

1032
00:45:44,300 --> 00:45:47,667
The fucking camera
fucking taking a picture of...

1033
00:45:47,667 --> 00:45:49,933
What the fuck are you doing?
You just like that--

1034
00:45:49,933 --> 00:45:52,667
That guy just clearly
likes that lady.

1035
00:45:52,667 --> 00:45:57,933
He's like a half an inch
away from her vagina

1036
00:45:57,933 --> 00:46:00,533
With the camera.

1037
00:46:00,533 --> 00:46:02,767
What is that?

1038
00:46:02,767 --> 00:46:03,800
We got the TV here.

1039
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:06,400
The TV is with us.

1040
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:08,500
You guys are gonna be
on the TV.

1041
00:46:08,500 --> 00:46:10,133
Mostly, it's gonna be
me talking,

1042
00:46:10,133 --> 00:46:12,167
And then somehow,
it'll cut to a shot

1043
00:46:12,167 --> 00:46:13,833
Of this lady's vagina.

1044
00:46:13,833 --> 00:46:16,767
Don't quite understand.

1045
00:46:19,733 --> 00:46:21,867
Has he given you
his business card yet?

1046
00:46:24,667 --> 00:46:26,467
No, listen, um...

1047
00:46:26,467 --> 00:46:29,500
Hey, it's great
to be here in San Francisco.

1048
00:46:29,500 --> 00:46:33,067
Uh, this is the first week
of, uh, the golf, you know,

1049
00:46:33,067 --> 00:46:36,200
And Tiger is, uh, my
favorite golfer ever, you know.

1050
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:37,733
And, you know,
he went to Stanford.

1051
00:46:37,733 --> 00:46:39,733
If you guys don't know that,
which is awesome.

1052
00:46:39,733 --> 00:46:42,767
And, uh, I'm hoping
this is his year, man,

1053
00:46:42,767 --> 00:46:44,667
Cause I feel bad
for the guy, you know.

1054
00:46:44,667 --> 00:46:47,967
And, uh, God damn, it's too bad
that happened and everything.

1055
00:46:47,967 --> 00:46:52,800
And, uh, you know,
whatever.

1056
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:56,633
I just hope he does good,
that's all I'm saying.

1057
00:46:56,633 --> 00:46:58,467
It was funny,
at the time it happened,

1058
00:46:58,467 --> 00:47:01,633
I--you know,
you get so, like, naive

1059
00:47:01,633 --> 00:47:03,200
About things,
you know what I mean?

1060
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:06,167
Like I remember I was, like,
outraged and everything.

1061
00:47:06,167 --> 00:47:08,133
I don't know what the fuck
I was thinking, you know?

1062
00:47:08,133 --> 00:47:09,967
Like I don't know
what I thought his life was,

1063
00:47:09,967 --> 00:47:12,167
But I remember at the time
going, "What?!

1064
00:47:12,167 --> 00:47:13,400
"I don't believe you.

1065
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:15,800
"Are you telling me--
You tell--

1066
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:18,767
"Are you trying to tell me

1067
00:47:18,767 --> 00:47:21,067
"That that guy
is worth 6 billion.

1068
00:47:21,067 --> 00:47:22,767
"You're telling me

1069
00:47:22,767 --> 00:47:24,700
"That the world's greatest
athlete over there,

1070
00:47:24,700 --> 00:47:26,233
"Tiger Woods,
you're telling me

1071
00:47:26,233 --> 00:47:28,067
"That that guy,

1072
00:47:28,067 --> 00:47:31,800
"That super handsome,
charismatic dude

1073
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:34,567
"Likes to lie down with ladies?
I don't buy it.

1074
00:47:34,567 --> 00:47:36,067
"I...

1075
00:47:36,067 --> 00:47:39,767
"Don't buy that
for one second.

1076
00:47:39,767 --> 00:47:41,967
Doesn't make any sense."

1077
00:47:45,067 --> 00:47:47,300
And then when it turned out
to be true,

1078
00:47:47,300 --> 00:47:49,900
I was all, like, outraged
like an idiot, you know.

1079
00:47:49,900 --> 00:47:51,500
I was like, "Ahh!

1080
00:47:51,500 --> 00:47:55,733
"I don't like hypocrites.

1081
00:47:55,733 --> 00:47:57,933
"I don't care for that.
I--

1082
00:47:57,933 --> 00:48:00,700
"He always presented
himself in public

1083
00:48:00,700 --> 00:48:02,333
As a golfer."

1084
00:48:04,833 --> 00:48:06,067
"I would see him on TV.

1085
00:48:06,067 --> 00:48:07,533
"He'd be hitting
a golf ball and shit,

1086
00:48:07,533 --> 00:48:09,200
"And the golf ball
would get near the hole.

1087
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:12,267
"That's what I thought.

1088
00:48:12,267 --> 00:48:14,967
"I didn't know he was leading
some kind of double life

1089
00:48:14,967 --> 00:48:16,733
"Where he was golfing by day

1090
00:48:16,733 --> 00:48:20,267
"And laying down with ladies
at the night.

1091
00:48:20,267 --> 00:48:21,533
"If I'd known that,

1092
00:48:21,533 --> 00:48:23,300
"I never would have bought
the fucking buick

1093
00:48:23,300 --> 00:48:27,300
"In the first place,
you know.

1094
00:48:27,300 --> 00:48:29,933
"Now I'm driving
down the street in my buick,

1095
00:48:29,933 --> 00:48:32,100
People snickering at me."

1096
00:48:34,433 --> 00:48:36,933
I don't know.

1097
00:48:36,933 --> 00:48:38,567
I don't know what I thought
his life was.

1098
00:48:38,567 --> 00:48:39,900
I try to remember back,
you know?

1099
00:48:39,900 --> 00:48:41,067
Cause when you look at it,

1100
00:48:41,067 --> 00:48:42,833
Of course, it makes complete
sense, you know.

1101
00:48:42,833 --> 00:48:44,067
What do you think,
he's like,

1102
00:48:44,067 --> 00:48:45,767
"Hey, I'm Tiger Woods.

1103
00:48:45,767 --> 00:48:48,567
"I just won
the Tiger Slam last--

1104
00:48:48,567 --> 00:48:50,467
"I have sipped
from the claret jug,

1105
00:48:50,467 --> 00:48:52,067
"And I've hoisted
the Wanamaker Trophy.

1106
00:48:52,067 --> 00:48:54,567
"Here I am trying on
my second green jacket.

1107
00:48:54,567 --> 00:48:55,967
"What should I do tonight?

1108
00:48:55,967 --> 00:48:57,467
"I know, I'll go back
to my hotel room alone

1109
00:48:57,467 --> 00:48:59,333
"All by myself.

1110
00:48:59,333 --> 00:49:02,600
"That'll be fun.

1111
00:49:02,600 --> 00:49:05,133
"I understand
there's a card sharks marathon

1112
00:49:05,133 --> 00:49:08,067
"On GSN tonight.

1113
00:49:08,067 --> 00:49:10,733
"I'll invite
Mark Calcavecchia over,

1114
00:49:10,733 --> 00:49:11,933
"And we'll have a...

1115
00:49:11,933 --> 00:49:13,767
We'll have a grand old time
together."

1116
00:49:13,767 --> 00:49:16,567
What the fuck?

1117
00:49:16,567 --> 00:49:18,633
"I'll just get
some room service.

1118
00:49:18,633 --> 00:49:20,367
"Hello. Uh, yeah,
I'd like, to...

1119
00:49:20,367 --> 00:49:21,733
"Oh, hi.
What's your name?

1120
00:49:21,733 --> 00:49:23,233
"Christine. Christine.

1121
00:49:23,233 --> 00:49:25,967
"Yeah, listen, I'd like to get
a chicken breast sandwich.

1122
00:49:25,967 --> 00:49:28,533
"No, I don't want a blow job
to end all blow jobs.

1123
00:49:28,533 --> 00:49:31,267
"I want...

1124
00:49:31,267 --> 00:49:34,400
"A chicken breast sandwich...

1125
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:37,833
"With a pickle.
Can I get a pickle with it?

1126
00:49:37,833 --> 00:49:40,267
"Can I get an eighth
of a pickle?

1127
00:49:40,267 --> 00:49:43,933
"Like, lengthwise sliced
so I just have 1/8.

1128
00:49:43,933 --> 00:49:45,467
You have anything
like that down there?"

1129
00:49:49,767 --> 00:49:51,700
But, see, I don't think
that he's like a...

1130
00:49:51,700 --> 00:49:53,067
People all think of him

1131
00:49:53,067 --> 00:49:54,967
As a sexual predator
or something, you know, but--

1132
00:49:54,967 --> 00:49:56,900
Like in the-- Like the--
But I don't think that.

1133
00:49:56,900 --> 00:49:58,367
I think the girls
went after him.

1134
00:49:58,367 --> 00:50:00,533
You know, I don't think
he's trolling through Perkins

1135
00:50:00,533 --> 00:50:02,533
Trying to find
waitresses, you know?

1136
00:50:02,533 --> 00:50:04,500
I think...

1137
00:50:04,500 --> 00:50:06,833
It's like he's in Perkins
with his lovely wife,

1138
00:50:06,833 --> 00:50:08,433
Enjoying a piece of pie,
you know,

1139
00:50:08,433 --> 00:50:09,667
And then he leaves,

1140
00:50:09,667 --> 00:50:11,033
And then the waitress runs out
and she goes,

1141
00:50:11,033 --> 00:50:12,867
"Oh, wait,
you forgot this thing,

1142
00:50:12,867 --> 00:50:15,367
Plus I'll fuck you tomorrow
if you come back."

1143
00:50:15,367 --> 00:50:17,667
He's like,
"Okay, well, the..."

1144
00:50:19,700 --> 00:50:21,000
So he has the, you know,

1145
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:24,033
The temptations of the flesh
all the time, you know,

1146
00:50:24,033 --> 00:50:30,867
And so, you know, you gotta
take that into account.

1147
00:50:30,867 --> 00:50:33,400
And Tiger,
he's not like us.

1148
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:34,833
He's not
like a regular guy.

1149
00:50:34,833 --> 00:50:35,900
He's like a rock star.

1150
00:50:35,900 --> 00:50:37,733
A regular guy,
you know what I mean,

1151
00:50:37,733 --> 00:50:39,133
He doesn't have that much--
How...

1152
00:50:39,133 --> 00:50:40,467
Like a guy
like me and you,

1153
00:50:40,467 --> 00:50:41,800
How many times
would we have a chance

1154
00:50:41,800 --> 00:50:43,600
To commit adult--
In our whole lives,

1155
00:50:43,600 --> 00:50:45,633
We might have
ten opportunities, you know?

1156
00:50:45,633 --> 00:50:47,033
Probably think it's ten.

1157
00:50:47,033 --> 00:50:49,033
Probably only six.

1158
00:50:49,033 --> 00:50:51,333
But... So let's say it's ten,

1159
00:50:51,333 --> 00:50:53,800
So we stray once,
that's 10%.

1160
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:56,233
Twice, 20%.

1161
00:50:56,233 --> 00:50:58,367
Now, Tiger, maybe he had
60, 70 women.

1162
00:50:58,367 --> 00:51:00,633
What about the 3 million
that he didn't fuck

1163
00:51:00,633 --> 00:51:03,067
That he could have?

1164
00:51:03,067 --> 00:51:06,667
You gotta factor
those gals in, you know?

1165
00:51:06,667 --> 00:51:08,267
Now, when you do that...

1166
00:51:08,267 --> 00:51:10,867
I did it on a little, uh,
calculator.

1167
00:51:10,867 --> 00:51:14,067
It turns out that Tiger
only had sex

1168
00:51:14,067 --> 00:51:18,700
With 0.0000000002%

1169
00:51:18,700 --> 00:51:21,100
Of the women he could--

1170
00:51:21,100 --> 00:51:24,800
Now, statistically,
that's 0%.

1171
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:28,967
From-- From a strictly
mathematical point of view,

1172
00:51:28,967 --> 00:51:31,967
Tiger is the most faithful man
who ever lived.

1173
00:51:31,967 --> 00:51:34,500
That's my point.

1174
00:51:34,500 --> 00:51:37,067
[applause]
so...

1175
00:51:37,067 --> 00:51:38,300
God bless him,

1176
00:51:38,300 --> 00:51:40,600
And I hope he does well
at the masters,

1177
00:51:40,600 --> 00:51:42,067
Cause, you know,
he's got a, uh...

1178
00:51:42,067 --> 00:51:44,067
You know, he trying
to catch, uh...

1179
00:51:44,067 --> 00:51:45,500
Nicklaus and Snead
and so forth,

1180
00:51:45,500 --> 00:51:49,133
And, you know, I've wasted
16 years of my life

1181
00:51:49,133 --> 00:51:52,600
Watching the fucking guy,
and, uh...

1182
00:51:52,600 --> 00:51:54,300
He's got a date
with destiny,

1183
00:51:54,300 --> 00:51:56,767
And I'm not talking
about some lady

1184
00:51:56,767 --> 00:51:59,300
At the Spearmint Rhino.

1185
00:51:59,300 --> 00:52:04,767
Literal destiny
he has a date with.

1186
00:52:04,767 --> 00:52:07,633
But anyways.

1187
00:52:07,633 --> 00:52:11,233
Oh, so San Francisco, man.

1188
00:52:11,233 --> 00:52:15,100
What else-- What else
is San Francisco famous for?

1189
00:52:15,100 --> 00:52:17,767
Oh, guys sucking
and fucking each other.

1190
00:52:19,167 --> 00:52:21,433
Forgot about that.

1191
00:52:21,433 --> 00:52:23,167
[laughter]

1192
00:52:25,567 --> 00:52:27,633
They're equally proud,
by the way.

1193
00:52:27,633 --> 00:52:29,967
They're just as proud
as straight people

1194
00:52:29,967 --> 00:52:31,300
Of their sucking and fucking.

1195
00:52:31,300 --> 00:52:33,067
As a matter of fact,
every year,

1196
00:52:33,067 --> 00:52:36,267
They're so proud,
they have a parade for it.

1197
00:52:36,267 --> 00:52:38,600
It's called
the gay pride parade,

1198
00:52:38,600 --> 00:52:42,267
And, uh,
it's a odd thing to me,

1199
00:52:42,267 --> 00:52:43,800
Cause I'll tell you something,

1200
00:52:43,800 --> 00:52:45,133
When I was a boy,
you know,

1201
00:52:45,133 --> 00:52:48,100
And I'm older
than you fellers, but...

1202
00:52:48,100 --> 00:52:49,633
When I was--
When I was--

1203
00:52:49,633 --> 00:52:51,400
When I was
six years of age,

1204
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:54,067
I remember my dad
showing me on the television,

1205
00:52:54,067 --> 00:52:56,300
There was a parade because
Neil Armstrong and the boys,

1206
00:52:56,300 --> 00:52:58,200
Why, they had gone
to the Moon.

1207
00:53:02,133 --> 00:53:04,833
They-- Here,
man had touched the...

1208
00:53:04,833 --> 00:53:07,967
The satellite that...

1209
00:53:07,967 --> 00:53:10,633
That whirls around
our whirling cinder,

1210
00:53:10,633 --> 00:53:12,200
And then they came back.

1211
00:53:12,200 --> 00:53:14,367
Now, they had
a parade for them.

1212
00:53:14,367 --> 00:53:15,733
My dad had me watch it

1213
00:53:15,733 --> 00:53:18,400
On his little Philco TV
that he kept in the kitchen,

1214
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:20,233
And he said--
I remember he said,

1215
00:53:20,233 --> 00:53:21,533
"Watch this, son," you know.

1216
00:53:21,533 --> 00:53:23,667
And Neil Armstrong
and the boys were going down,

1217
00:53:23,667 --> 00:53:25,133
Ticker tape, Fifth Avenue.

1218
00:53:25,133 --> 00:53:27,133
It was like
a very majestic moment.

1219
00:53:27,133 --> 00:53:29,300
Now, this
is how parades have,

1220
00:53:29,300 --> 00:53:33,567
In my mind,
devolved a little.

1221
00:53:33,567 --> 00:53:35,067
Now it's a bunch of guys

1222
00:53:35,067 --> 00:53:38,100
Who like sucking and fucking
each other.

1223
00:53:43,333 --> 00:53:45,067
Am I supposed to bring
my kid on my shoulders?

1224
00:53:45,067 --> 00:53:46,700
"Hey, look at that!

1225
00:53:46,700 --> 00:53:48,400
"Enjoy your cotton candy.

1226
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:49,667
"There's some more guys

1227
00:53:49,667 --> 00:53:51,667
Who like sucking
and fucking each other."

1228
00:53:56,467 --> 00:53:58,067
And they like doing it.

1229
00:53:58,067 --> 00:53:59,467
I don't think you get
a parade

1230
00:53:59,467 --> 00:54:00,567
For something you like--

1231
00:54:00,567 --> 00:54:02,400
Like, if they didn't like,

1232
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:04,133
Maybe then I'd show up,
you know what I mean?

1233
00:54:04,133 --> 00:54:06,433
If they... If it was like,
"I don't like it,

1234
00:54:06,433 --> 00:54:08,067
"But God damn it,
I'll do it for my country.

1235
00:54:08,067 --> 00:54:09,200
Aah!"

1236
00:54:10,767 --> 00:54:15,567
Then I'd go,
"Son, that man's a patriot.

1237
00:54:15,567 --> 00:54:19,500
"He understands there's
greater than the individual.

1238
00:54:19,500 --> 00:54:21,100
There's..."

1239
00:54:25,767 --> 00:54:27,367
But there is
one very touching moment,

1240
00:54:27,367 --> 00:54:29,400
Cause a guy took me
to this gay pride parade.

1241
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:31,267
And the most touching moment--
Makes you cry--

1242
00:54:31,267 --> 00:54:35,400
Is there's the parents
of the adult gay children,

1243
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:38,600
And they're holding,
like, signs and stuff, you know,

1244
00:54:38,600 --> 00:54:41,567
And it's the most moving,
uh, part of it,

1245
00:54:41,567 --> 00:54:43,133
And, uh, first of all,

1246
00:54:43,133 --> 00:54:45,100
They're not dancing around
in leather and shit.

1247
00:54:45,100 --> 00:54:46,100
And, uh...

1248
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:49,700
But you see them,

1249
00:54:49,700 --> 00:54:51,733
And some of these guys
are old fellas,

1250
00:54:51,733 --> 00:54:53,933
You could tell, you know,
were in korea and stuff,

1251
00:54:53,933 --> 00:54:55,167
You know what I mean?

1252
00:54:55,167 --> 00:54:58,500
And so... And they carry signs
that say,

1253
00:54:58,500 --> 00:55:02,067
You know, "I am proud
that my son is gay," you know.

1254
00:55:02,067 --> 00:55:04,533
And it's so beautiful,
but I still...

1255
00:55:04,533 --> 00:55:06,267
I think they're choosing
the wrong words,

1256
00:55:06,267 --> 00:55:09,200
Cause pride, again...
I don't, you know...

1257
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:12,400
Like, there's a difference
between accepting

1258
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:14,467
And loving
and everything like that.

1259
00:55:14,467 --> 00:55:16,333
But, uh, you know,

1260
00:55:16,333 --> 00:55:18,500
I don't think anybody's
bragging about it

1261
00:55:18,500 --> 00:55:20,967
Down at work or anything,
you know?

1262
00:55:25,333 --> 00:55:28,067
Guy goes, "Hey, guys,
come over here, man,

1263
00:55:28,067 --> 00:55:32,067
"I want to tell you something
about my youngest son, Bill.

1264
00:55:32,067 --> 00:55:33,667
McCluskey,
get over here."

1265
00:55:36,867 --> 00:55:38,233
"I want to tell you
about Bill.

1266
00:55:38,233 --> 00:55:39,500
"We're so proud of him.

1267
00:55:39,500 --> 00:55:42,067
"He graduated Harvard this year,
top of his class.

1268
00:55:42,067 --> 00:55:43,967
"Gonna be a lawyer,
what do you think of that, huh?

1269
00:55:43,967 --> 00:55:46,867
"You can use him, McCluskey,
next time you get in trouble.

1270
00:55:46,867 --> 00:55:48,167
"Yeah, my son.

1271
00:55:48,167 --> 00:55:51,633
"None of us MacPhersons
ever graduated the fifth grade.

1272
00:55:51,633 --> 00:55:53,400
"We're all just a bunch
of chunks of coal,

1273
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:55,733
"But, aw, it's
all gonna change now.

1274
00:55:55,733 --> 00:55:57,933
"Our young son, Bill.

1275
00:55:57,933 --> 00:55:59,900
"Tell you something else
we're proud of him for.

1276
00:55:59,900 --> 00:56:01,067
He..."

1277
00:56:01,067 --> 00:56:03,833
[laughter]

1278
00:56:05,500 --> 00:56:08,067
"He was on the junior varsity
basketball team,

1279
00:56:08,067 --> 00:56:11,533
"And, uh,
in a span of seven games,

1280
00:56:11,533 --> 00:56:13,867
"He had four triple-doubles
to end the season.

1281
00:56:13,867 --> 00:56:15,200
"What do you think
of that, huh?

1282
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:17,267
"Unbelievable.
Also loves cock.

1283
00:56:17,267 --> 00:56:18,833
I don't know the--"

1284
00:56:20,200 --> 00:56:21,467
"In his mouth,
up his ass,

1285
00:56:21,467 --> 00:56:23,400
"This kid, he doesn't care.

1286
00:56:23,400 --> 00:56:24,633
"I don't know
how he does it.

1287
00:56:24,633 --> 00:56:27,800
"I can't do it myself.

1288
00:56:27,800 --> 00:56:28,767
Yeah."

1289
00:56:30,467 --> 00:56:32,867
"My son, Bill.

1290
00:56:32,867 --> 00:56:35,300
"Gonna be a lawyer.

1291
00:56:35,300 --> 00:56:36,633
"I got a picture of him.

1292
00:56:36,633 --> 00:56:38,467
"He's gonna be articling
in greenwich next year.

1293
00:56:38,467 --> 00:56:39,800
"There he is.
He's graduating.

1294
00:56:39,800 --> 00:56:42,367
"That's
his graduation picture.

1295
00:56:42,367 --> 00:56:44,467
"Look at that,
with his robes there,

1296
00:56:44,467 --> 00:56:46,367
"And the mortarboard,
you know, look at--

1297
00:56:46,367 --> 00:56:48,267
"It's the hat, McCluskey,
you ignorant bastard!

1298
00:56:48,267 --> 00:56:49,500
"They call it that.

1299
00:56:49,500 --> 00:56:51,100
"Look at him there, huh?

1300
00:56:51,100 --> 00:56:53,133
"What a picture.

1301
00:56:53,133 --> 00:56:54,500
"You can't see it
in the picture,

1302
00:56:54,500 --> 00:56:58,700
"But he's got eight cocks
wedged up his ass.

1303
00:56:58,700 --> 00:57:00,233
"And, of course,
you can see

1304
00:57:00,233 --> 00:57:02,300
"The fine spray of jizz

1305
00:57:02,300 --> 00:57:04,400
"Arcing over his tongue

1306
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:06,700
"As he greedily
laps it up.

1307
00:57:06,700 --> 00:57:08,067
Well, well..."

1308
00:57:10,700 --> 00:57:14,767
"I feel so much pride
when I see that picture.

1309
00:57:14,767 --> 00:57:18,767
Pride is the thing
that I most feel."

1310
00:57:20,367 --> 00:57:22,667
Anyway...

1311
00:57:22,667 --> 00:57:24,767
Listen, folks...

1312
00:57:24,767 --> 00:57:26,400
I just want to say, uh,

1313
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:28,100
San Francisco's,
uh, awesome.

1314
00:57:28,100 --> 00:57:30,467
And, uh, I'm from L.A.

1315
00:57:30,467 --> 00:57:33,833
And, uh, hey, we can't wait
to get your football team.

1316
00:57:38,233 --> 00:57:39,900
We're looking forward
to that.

1317
00:57:39,900 --> 00:57:40,933
And, um...

1318
00:57:40,933 --> 00:57:43,067
- How's O.J.?

1319
00:57:43,067 --> 00:57:45,733
- O.J.?

1320
00:57:45,733 --> 00:57:48,333
Well, I've changed my mind
on O.J.

1321
00:57:48,333 --> 00:57:50,967
No, I'll tell you what
I feel about O.J.

1322
00:57:52,733 --> 00:57:54,633
[cheers and applause]
it's...

1323
00:57:57,733 --> 00:58:02,067
I feel-- As much as I was
indignant about his acquittal,

1324
00:58:02,067 --> 00:58:05,367
I'm equally indignant
about his, uh,

1325
00:58:05,367 --> 00:58:10,667
His going to prison for stealing
his fucking own shirts.

1326
00:58:10,667 --> 00:58:12,367
I don't think that's fair.

1327
00:58:12,367 --> 00:58:14,633
I don't think,
if you steal your own shirts,

1328
00:58:14,633 --> 00:58:19,200
You should get
35 consecutive life sentences.

1329
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:23,800
That doesn't seem fair
to me at all.

1330
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:26,133
And now he's
probably saying,

1331
00:58:26,133 --> 00:58:27,800
"I wish I got fucking...

1332
00:58:27,800 --> 00:58:30,567
You know, I wish I was
put up for the other crime."

1333
00:58:30,567 --> 00:58:32,100
Because here's the thing.

1334
00:58:32,100 --> 00:58:34,233
In prison, they have
a pecking order.

1335
00:58:37,300 --> 00:58:38,733
Now...

1336
00:58:38,733 --> 00:58:40,433
In the pecking order,

1337
00:58:40,433 --> 00:58:42,800
One of the top people
on the pecking order

1338
00:58:42,800 --> 00:58:45,133
Are the double murderers.

1339
00:58:45,133 --> 00:58:47,200
They're way up high.

1340
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:51,800
Very well respected
members...

1341
00:58:51,800 --> 00:58:58,300
Of the, uh, old gray bar,
you know, community.

1342
00:58:58,300 --> 00:59:03,267
But... Guys who steal
their own shirts...

1343
00:59:03,267 --> 00:59:06,167
They're at the lowest
on the pecking order.

1344
00:59:06,167 --> 00:59:10,867
And the pecking order involves
a lot of ass fucking, basically.

1345
00:59:10,867 --> 00:59:14,600
And, uh, so I feel
sorry for O.J.,

1346
00:59:14,600 --> 00:59:15,967
Cause I'm sure he's going,

1347
00:59:15,967 --> 00:59:18,767
"Wait, I fucking killed
two fucking people.

1348
00:59:18,767 --> 00:59:21,300
I killed a waiter
and my wife, savagely."

1349
00:59:21,300 --> 00:59:23,767
And they're like,
"We saw the fucking trial.

1350
00:59:23,767 --> 00:59:26,933
"If the glove don't fit,
you can't acquit.

1351
00:59:26,933 --> 00:59:29,333
"You stole a jersey
and nothin' more.

1352
00:59:29,333 --> 00:59:31,867
"Now get your fucking ass
over here.

1353
00:59:31,867 --> 00:59:33,500
I have to fuck it."

1354
00:59:33,500 --> 00:59:35,433
No.

1355
00:59:35,433 --> 00:59:37,400
