1
00:00:02,414 --> 00:00:05,547
Remember how it looked the
last time we were here?

2
00:00:05,547 --> 00:00:07,140
What a difference
a year makes, huh?

3
00:00:08,285 --> 00:00:10,576
One year, two months
and twelve days.

4
00:00:12,110 --> 00:00:13,235
But who's counting?

5
00:00:13,235 --> 00:00:15,196
It'll be fine.
You'll see.

6
00:00:15,565 --> 00:00:19,360
After all that Kaleipus has done to
make this happen, I certainly hope so.

7
00:00:19,813 --> 00:00:23,388
-I'm not talking about the treaty, Xena.
- Shh.

8
00:00:34,797 --> 00:00:35,830
Solan.

9
00:00:37,096 --> 00:00:38,985
Solan, you dirty rat!

10
00:00:39,204 --> 00:00:41,331
I almost had you!
I've been practicing!

11
00:00:41,331 --> 00:00:43,071
Very impressive.
Don't you do it again.

12
00:00:43,986 --> 00:00:46,962
What do you think, Gabrielle?
Some tracker, huh?

13
00:00:47,197 --> 00:00:49,291
He's a natural.

14
00:00:50,694 --> 00:00:52,485
-Hi, Solan.
-Hi, Gabrielle!

15
00:00:52,864 --> 00:00:55,174
Wait till you see! I got a staff just like yours!

16
00:00:55,643 --> 00:00:57,912
Really. That's great!

17
00:00:59,269 --> 00:01:01,114
Sounds like you've been pretty
busy since we were here, huh?

18
00:01:01,114 --> 00:01:03,258
He's learned a lot.

19
00:01:04,831 --> 00:01:07,354
He's clearly had a good teacher.

20
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:11,297
-Hello, Kaleipus.
-Xena.

21
00:01:11,297 --> 00:01:13,054
It's been a long time.

22
00:01:13,978 --> 00:01:15,615
Forever.

23
00:01:17,431 --> 00:01:19,912
- Thank you both for coming.
- We should be thanking you.

24
00:01:20,541 --> 00:01:23,981
This treaty
-- it could be the start of reuniting the Centaur nation.

25
00:01:24,305 --> 00:01:26,086
That's why the delegates
brought their children,

26
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:28,774
so they can appreciate
the legacy we're leaving them--

27
00:01:29,015 --> 00:01:31,649
a legacy of peace...and hope.

28
00:01:34,213 --> 00:01:36,061
Hey, what are we waiting for, huh?

29
00:01:36,277 --> 00:01:38,204
Solan, I'll race you
to the edge of the village.

30
00:01:38,204 --> 00:01:40,027
On your mark, get set--

31
00:01:40,986 --> 00:01:42,556
-Go!
-No fair!

32
00:01:42,556 --> 00:01:44,090
-That's cheating!
-You'll never catch me!

33
00:01:47,595 --> 00:01:50,143
Kaleipus, you should know
that nothing's changed.

34
00:01:50,611 --> 00:01:52,831
I didn't come back here
to claim Solan.

35
00:01:53,675 --> 00:01:57,677
And besides, you're more a father
to him than if he was really yours.

36
00:01:59,019 --> 00:02:02,331
I just came back here to give
him a chance at a safer future.

37
00:02:03,581 --> 00:02:06,630
Thanks to you, the future's never looked better
-- for everyone.

38
00:02:58,524 --> 00:03:01,048
A child.

39
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,247
I've always wanted a child.

40
00:03:14,082 --> 00:03:16,784
In a time of ancient gods

41
00:03:18,504 --> 00:03:21,784
warlords and kings,

42
00:03:21,784 --> 00:03:25,254
a land in turmoil
cried out for a hero.

43
00:03:34,285 --> 00:03:36,116
She was Xena,

44
00:03:36,782 --> 00:03:40,784
a mighty princess
forged in the heat of battle.

45
00:03:44,287 --> 00:03:47,005
The power.

46
00:03:48,098 --> 00:03:50,456
The passion.

47
00:03:52,682 --> 00:03:55,224
-The danger.

48
00:03:59,487 --> 00:04:02,678
Her courage will change the world.

49
00:04:18,374 --> 00:04:20,487
Surprise!

50
00:04:21,621 --> 00:04:22,923
Ephiny!

51
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:29,887
I can't believe this.

52
00:04:33,251 --> 00:04:33,971
Xenon?

53
00:04:37,776 --> 00:04:39,702
Why didn't you send
word that you were coming?

54
00:04:39,702 --> 00:04:41,174
And spoil the surprise?

55
00:04:41,716 --> 00:04:45,279
Besides, as a Centaur prince, this
treaty's important for Xenon. Huh? Huh?

56
00:04:51,125 --> 00:04:53,002
Why don't you two go play?

57
00:04:53,002 --> 00:04:56,202
-Give Gabrielle and me a chance to catch up, huh?
-Okay.

58
00:04:57,254 --> 00:04:59,672
Nope. Sorry, Sweetie, but you might lose him.

59
00:04:59,672 --> 00:05:02,172
Lucas will be here
when you get back. Now scoot!

60
00:05:02,724 --> 00:05:03,888
Come on, Xenon.

61
00:05:10,476 --> 00:05:12,599
Gabrielle, what is it?
What's wrong?

62
00:05:29,099 --> 00:05:30,987
It's pathetic.

63
00:05:43,915 --> 00:05:45,646
Both the totems are on fire!

64
00:05:48,447 --> 00:05:50,135
What do you think you're doing?

65
00:05:50,135 --> 00:05:52,466
Just sending a message to an old friend.

66
00:05:57,126 --> 00:05:59,574
I can't believe it's only been a couple of months.

67
00:06:00,857 --> 00:06:03,945
Feels like a lifetime
since Xena and I were in Brittania.

68
00:06:05,429 --> 00:06:08,552
Word was Xena helped Boadicea
defeat Caesar.

69
00:06:09,448 --> 00:06:10,851
That's true.

70
00:06:14,046 --> 00:06:17,264
While we were there,
I, uh--

71
00:06:18,198 --> 00:06:21,047
I got into a,a very bad situation.

72
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:23,427
What do you mean?
What happened?

73
00:06:24,482 --> 00:06:26,587
I had a child.

74
00:06:29,101 --> 00:06:33,022
And, sh--
She died.

75
00:06:37,086 --> 00:06:38,771
I named her Hope.

76
00:06:40,013 --> 00:06:43,117
That's what she was.
She was my hope that, um,

77
00:06:43,355 --> 00:06:45,461
despite everything,that had happened,

78
00:06:46,819 --> 00:06:49,354
this child was,was worth it all.

79
00:06:50,732 --> 00:06:53,617
You can't blame yourself for her death.

80
00:06:54,726 --> 00:06:58,853
Only the Fates know why sleep
steals a child's life.

81
00:07:02,644 --> 00:07:04,331
I'm so sorry.

82
00:07:07,107 --> 00:07:09,582
Cut those men down.
Now!

83
00:07:12,145 --> 00:07:15,731
- I want the group responsible for this.
- It wasn't a group.

84
00:07:16,079 --> 00:07:19,560
Look. There's no footprints.
Nothing's been disturbed.

85
00:07:20,061 --> 00:07:21,623
It could be a god--

86
00:07:21,623 --> 00:07:23,001
Ares maybe--

87
00:07:23,249 --> 00:07:26,185
-angry over the treaty.
-No, it's not his style.

88
00:07:26,893 --> 00:07:29,394
There's only one who would
relish something like this.

89
00:07:29,953 --> 00:07:32,747
But unless the impossible's
happened, she's trapped for good.

90
00:07:33,931 --> 00:07:36,832
-You sure you'll be okay?
-I'll be fine.

91
00:07:36,832 --> 00:07:38,910
Now go, or you'll be late for your meeting.

92
00:07:39,694 --> 00:07:43,595
Ephiny...
- don't forget Lucas.

93
00:07:46,581 --> 00:07:49,067
This wolf
-- it's by Senticles, isn't it?

94
00:07:51,305 --> 00:07:53,724
Xena gave me a wooden
lamb last winter solstice.

95
00:07:54,410 --> 00:07:55,693
I gave it to Hope.

96
00:07:57,769 --> 00:08:01,074
-Why don't you get some rest?
- I will.

97
00:08:29,537 --> 00:08:31,575
Whoever you are,
I know you're there.

98
00:08:31,575 --> 00:08:33,802
So come out.

99
00:08:35,614 --> 00:08:36,614
Now!

100
00:08:45,366 --> 00:08:46,762
I'm sorry.

101
00:08:48,365 --> 00:08:50,864
I-I'm not gonna hurt you.

102
00:08:53,524 --> 00:08:56,075
What's your name?

103
00:08:58,575 --> 00:09:02,912
Fayla.
Are you Xena,the warrior princess?

104
00:09:03,181 --> 00:09:06,304
No, I'm not Xena.
I'm Gabrielle.

105
00:09:07,492 --> 00:09:09,401
Xena's a friend of mine.

106
00:09:09,743 --> 00:09:12,633
- Maybe I can help you.
- It has to be Xena.

107
00:09:13,133 --> 00:09:15,239
The monster lady made me promise.

108
00:09:15,929 --> 00:09:17,240
Monster lady?

109
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:20,639
She said she'd hurt me
if Itold anyone else. And she can.

110
00:09:21,242 --> 00:09:22,259
She's a god.

111
00:09:23,914 --> 00:09:26,890
Fayla, this monster lady,

112
00:09:28,288 --> 00:09:30,154
did she tell you her name?

113
00:09:30,154 --> 00:09:31,617
Callisto.

114
00:09:31,617 --> 00:09:34,431
I sensed it earlier.
But how could she escape?

115
00:09:37,244 --> 00:09:40,305
This message she told you
to give me, what is it?

116
00:09:40,511 --> 00:09:42,338
She told me to tell you that...

117
00:09:42,338 --> 00:09:46,337
she knows your little secret, and
she's gonna take it to the grave.

118
00:09:47,806 --> 00:09:51,184
That's all.
Now can I go?

119
00:09:52,869 --> 00:09:53,983
Wait.

120
00:10:02,258 --> 00:10:04,354
Callisto knows about Solan.

121
00:10:05,374 --> 00:10:08,071
-But how?
- Whoever freed her must've told her.

122
00:10:08,071 --> 00:10:10,374
But who that is, or how they know
-- Doesn't matter.

123
00:10:10,886 --> 00:10:12,467
Bottom line is protecting Solan.

124
00:10:13,842 --> 00:10:16,010
What about hiding Solan
in the Ixion caves?

125
00:10:16,010 --> 00:10:19,230
- Should be safe there.
- Maybe we should take Fayla too.

126
00:10:20,373 --> 00:10:22,368
How about it, Fay--

127
00:10:27,078 --> 00:10:29,307
Tell me again how Xena
looked when you told her...

128
00:10:29,307 --> 00:10:31,573
that I'd take her precious
little secret to the grave.

129
00:10:32,950 --> 00:10:35,950
Like she'd been stabbed through
the heart with her own sword.

130
00:10:37,826 --> 00:10:39,775
And that's
exactly how she'll feel too...

131
00:10:39,775 --> 00:10:43,793
when Solan dies
-- stabbed, stabbed through the heart.

132
00:10:44,199 --> 00:10:47,570
-Ow! That hurts.
- Pierced to the soul with such exquisite pain.

133
00:10:48,221 --> 00:10:50,346
-Don't!
-Oh, I wish I could've seen it.

134
00:10:50,632 --> 00:10:51,568
Stop!

135
00:10:56,269 --> 00:10:57,798
You'll get your chance.

136
00:10:58,910 --> 00:11:00,693
Why do you think I freed you?

137
00:11:01,506 --> 00:11:02,697
To make her suffer.

138
00:11:03,174 --> 00:11:04,662
To make her stop.

139
00:11:06,071 --> 00:11:07,985
My father's kingdom is at hand.

140
00:11:08,393 --> 00:11:11,612
The age of darkness, when Dahak will
snuff out the people Xena loves...

141
00:11:11,816 --> 00:11:13,548
till he's crushed her very soul.

142
00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:18,601
And as she goes,so goes the world.

143
00:11:24,397 --> 00:11:27,758
No way. I'm not a baby! None
of the other kids have to hide.

144
00:11:28,785 --> 00:11:30,487
You're not one of the other kids.

145
00:11:36,936 --> 00:11:40,811
Kaleipus, do you mind
if I talk to Solan alone?

146
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:51,156
What's with him anyway?

147
00:11:51,555 --> 00:11:53,970
-He's worried about you.
-Why?

148
00:11:54,498 --> 00:11:55,750
I can take care of myself.

149
00:11:57,775 --> 00:11:59,753
He is your father.

150
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,836
Maybe not by blood, but he couldn't
love you any more if he were.

151
00:12:04,178 --> 00:12:05,878
And when you are a parent...

152
00:12:05,878 --> 00:12:09,427
and your child is in danger, that is
the scariest feeling in all the world.

153
00:12:10,290 --> 00:12:13,603
-You're saying he's scared.
-I'm saying he loves you.

154
00:12:14,689 --> 00:12:16,074
And though you might not
understand the reason,

155
00:12:16,074 --> 00:12:18,197
you have to trust that someone
who loves you that much...

156
00:12:18,197 --> 00:12:20,088
is only trying to do
what's best for you.

157
00:12:20,450 --> 00:12:22,586
-Right?
-I guess so.

158
00:12:23,447 --> 00:12:24,603
So do me a favor.

159
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,294
Cut him some slack,all right?

160
00:12:29,593 --> 00:12:30,876
Deal?

161
00:12:34,689 --> 00:12:37,030
Deal.
But you owe me.

162
00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:38,592
Big time.

163
00:12:40,376 --> 00:12:41,246
Thanks.

164
00:12:52,204 --> 00:12:53,451
Where did you get this?

165
00:12:53,451 --> 00:12:57,001
I didn't steal it. It's mine.
It's always been mine.

166
00:12:57,388 --> 00:12:59,035
The people who found me said so.

167
00:13:00,379 --> 00:13:01,511
Found you?

168
00:13:02,983 --> 00:13:04,828
They said it was in the basket with me.

169
00:13:06,387 --> 00:13:08,386
All's I remember is
lots of water,

170
00:13:09,169 --> 00:13:10,545
me crying for my mom.

171
00:13:13,464 --> 00:13:17,342
-But she never came.
-Gabrielle! Gabrielle!

172
00:13:18,642 --> 00:13:20,295
Xena says to hurry.
They're ready to go.

173
00:13:24,125 --> 00:13:26,168
Is there something wrong?

174
00:13:28,169 --> 00:13:30,750
No.
No, I'll be right there.

175
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:40,544
Look, um, there's
something that I have to do here.

176
00:13:41,226 --> 00:13:44,762
So I want you to do
a favor for me. Okay?

177
00:13:45,037 --> 00:13:47,135
I want you to wait in my hut
till I get back.

178
00:13:47,524 --> 00:13:49,606
And this way,
I-I'll know you're safe.

179
00:13:50,051 --> 00:13:51,428
I don't see why you are.

180
00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:54,696
You will.

181
00:13:55,821 --> 00:13:57,227
Do you promise?

182
00:13:57,726 --> 00:13:59,039
I promise.

183
00:14:01,071 --> 00:14:01,780
Okay.

184
00:14:06,379 --> 00:14:07,504
Bye.

185
00:14:10,235 --> 00:14:11,627
Bye-bye,

186
00:14:12,078 --> 00:14:13,706
Mommy.

187
00:14:24,293 --> 00:14:27,070
Wait.
I smell burning.

188
00:14:51,916 --> 00:14:53,324
Really, Xena?

189
00:14:53,950 --> 00:14:55,888
Is that any way to greet an old friend?

190
00:14:57,220 --> 00:14:59,541
Especially considering the
warm welcome I just gave you.

191
00:15:00,124 --> 00:15:02,451
How'd you do it, Callisto?
Who helped you?

192
00:15:03,012 --> 00:15:05,167
That lava pit should have held you forever.

193
00:15:05,949 --> 00:15:08,191
Well, that's for me to know and you to find out.

194
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,314
But I didn't come here to talk about me.

195
00:15:10,314 --> 00:15:12,388
I came to meet your precious little son.

196
00:15:13,417 --> 00:15:14,532
Solan, isn't it?

197
00:15:15,421 --> 00:15:16,621
Flesh of your flesh.

198
00:15:17,495 --> 00:15:18,667
Bone of your bone.

199
00:15:19,638 --> 00:15:20,669
Blood of your blood.

200
00:15:21,887 --> 00:15:24,731
Can't wait to see all that.

201
00:15:25,262 --> 00:15:28,574
Hurt my son and I swear
by any god you name, I'll--

202
00:15:28,574 --> 00:15:29,732
You'll do what?

203
00:15:31,309 --> 00:15:33,042
You're gonna make my life
a living hell?

204
00:15:33,595 --> 00:15:34,794
Old hat, dear.

205
00:15:39,382 --> 00:15:42,539
You did that years ago, when you barbecued my family.

206
00:15:42,777 --> 00:15:45,071
But now it's my turn
to host the cookout!

207
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:48,445
And where is the guest of honor?

208
00:15:51,599 --> 00:15:52,840
Solan.

209
00:15:54,682 --> 00:15:55,857
Solan, dear.

210
00:15:57,022 --> 00:15:59,087
Come meet
your Auntie Callisto.

211
00:15:59,806 --> 00:16:00,647
No!

212
00:16:06,773 --> 00:16:08,045
Gabrielle.

213
00:16:12,244 --> 00:16:13,670
Clever you--

214
00:16:15,045 --> 00:16:17,180
fooling me with
the old "bait and switch."

215
00:16:18,138 --> 00:16:19,183
Good plan.

216
00:16:19,806 --> 00:16:21,087
After all,

217
00:16:21,815 --> 00:16:27,347
even I can't be at two places
at the same time now, can I?

218
00:16:42,068 --> 00:16:43,381
Solan?

219
00:16:44,195 --> 00:16:46,319
I thought I told you to wait back there!

220
00:17:01,626 --> 00:17:03,471
Zeus's child,
what are you doing here?

221
00:17:13,362 --> 00:17:16,463
I don't understand! Even Callisto
can't be in two places at once.

222
00:17:16,691 --> 00:17:19,181
She's not working alone.
She as good as said so.

223
00:17:19,466 --> 00:17:22,160
-What?
-Someone is helping her.

224
00:17:24,125 --> 00:17:25,553
I just don't know who.

225
00:17:29,838 --> 00:17:31,469
Kaleipus.

226
00:17:38,909 --> 00:17:41,260
Kaleipus,Kaleipus, what happened?

227
00:17:42,097 --> 00:17:43,106
Where is Solan?

228
00:17:43,574 --> 00:17:46,504
- Where's Solan?
- Safe.

229
00:17:47,045 --> 00:17:48,295
Went for help.

230
00:17:50,856 --> 00:17:51,767
Who did this?

231
00:17:52,858 --> 00:17:55,357
Th-The child.

232
00:17:55,357 --> 00:17:57,172
- What? I can't hear you.

233
00:18:01,266 --> 00:18:03,421
Raise him.

234
00:18:26,518 --> 00:18:28,038
I'm so sorry.

235
00:18:29,229 --> 00:18:33,092
Kaleipus was one of the
finest people I ever knew.

236
00:18:33,092 --> 00:18:36,188
Like my father,and my mom.

237
00:18:39,290 --> 00:18:41,500
Why does everyone I love die?

238
00:18:44,010 --> 00:18:45,918
-Is it me?
-No.

239
00:18:46,514 --> 00:18:49,636
-No, of course not.
-Then why are they dead?

240
00:18:49,636 --> 00:18:53,073
-Everyone who ever loved me.
-They're not. You still have m--

241
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:56,560
Many, many friends.

242
00:18:57,352 --> 00:19:00,399
And they've all said how much they love you
and want you to come and live with them.

243
00:19:01,515 --> 00:19:02,750
But I don't want to.

244
00:19:06,438 --> 00:19:09,529
-I want to live with you.
-What?

245
00:19:10,252 --> 00:19:12,513
I won't be any trouble.
I promise.

246
00:19:12,749 --> 00:19:15,879
I'll catch my own food and keep
up. And I'm hardly ever sick.

247
00:19:15,879 --> 00:19:17,631
-Solan, I don't think--
-Please.

248
00:19:19,048 --> 00:19:21,516
My uncle always said,
if anything happened to him,

249
00:19:21,516 --> 00:19:23,205
you'd be there for me.

250
00:19:23,592 --> 00:19:25,129
And he was right.

251
00:19:25,794 --> 00:19:28,512
But all your ties are here. Don't you
wanna be with someone that you know,

252
00:19:28,512 --> 00:19:32,214
-someone that you care about?
- Yes. You.

253
00:19:34,669 --> 00:19:38,911
You said we were friends. And real
friends are like family, right?

254
00:19:39,685 --> 00:19:44,716
-Like family.
-Then take me with you. Please?

255
00:19:45,668 --> 00:19:47,390
Don't leave me.

256
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:54,763
When all this is over, you
be packed and ready to go.

257
00:19:56,530 --> 00:19:59,233
We've got a lot to talk about. We
might as well do it on the road.

258
00:20:06,329 --> 00:20:07,099
Hope.

259
00:20:07,904 --> 00:20:10,344
Hope.
Are you here?

260
00:20:12,794 --> 00:20:14,982
Hope, what's happened?

261
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:18,777
That half-assed old man.

262
00:20:19,891 --> 00:20:21,736
He caught me coming for Solan.

263
00:20:22,342 --> 00:20:23,809
So you had to kill him.

264
00:20:24,497 --> 00:20:28,292
And look what it's done to you--
meek as a little kitten.

265
00:20:29,394 --> 00:20:31,652
Which means Solan is mine.

266
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:33,393
No.

267
00:20:36,453 --> 00:20:37,956
You have to get me out of here.

268
00:20:39,985 --> 00:20:42,882
Leave me now, and join the
rest of your puny gods...

269
00:20:42,882 --> 00:20:45,750
when Dahak
destroys them.

270
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:50,081
Lose everything I promised--
everything Dahak brings.

271
00:20:53,173 --> 00:20:56,172
Well, what is a little more time?

272
00:20:57,371 --> 00:20:59,027
And when you're well,

273
00:21:02,183 --> 00:21:04,434
-we'll obliterate them all.
-No.

274
00:21:05,722 --> 00:21:07,691
Better to crush their dreams.

275
00:21:07,691 --> 00:21:09,430
Destroy their future.

276
00:21:10,252 --> 00:21:12,594
We'll kill
what they love most--

277
00:21:14,210 --> 00:21:15,910
their children.

278
00:21:20,938 --> 00:21:24,083
Come on, boys! Quickly
now! Hurry! Quickly!

279
00:21:24,407 --> 00:21:25,722
Fayla!

280
00:21:40,617 --> 00:21:43,533
Where have you been? I have
been looking all over for you!

281
00:21:43,533 --> 00:21:45,444
You said that you would
wait here. Remember?

282
00:21:45,444 --> 00:21:47,432
I'm sorry,but she wouldn't let me!

283
00:21:47,432 --> 00:21:49,018
I tried to get away,but she--

284
00:21:51,313 --> 00:21:52,321
Who?

285
00:21:53,363 --> 00:21:54,893
Who, Callisto?

286
00:21:56,696 --> 00:21:57,987
I have this power...

287
00:21:58,802 --> 00:21:59,979
to move things.

288
00:22:01,821 --> 00:22:02,894
I don't know why.

289
00:22:03,695 --> 00:22:05,818
She says it's'cause I'm evil.

290
00:22:08,819 --> 00:22:10,070
That is a lie.

291
00:22:11,654 --> 00:22:13,041
You are not evil.

292
00:22:14,071 --> 00:22:15,373
Never believe that.

293
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:17,633
My mother thought so.

294
00:22:19,730 --> 00:22:21,249
She tried to drown me in a basket.

295
00:22:21,533 --> 00:22:22,873
She wanted me dead.

296
00:22:25,198 --> 00:22:27,313
She-- She wasn't trying to drown you.

297
00:22:27,313 --> 00:22:28,906
She was trying to save your life.

298
00:22:29,228 --> 00:22:31,217
You weren't there!
You don't know!

299
00:22:31,476 --> 00:22:32,494
I do.

300
00:22:37,061 --> 00:22:38,231
The basket is all there was.

301
00:22:38,231 --> 00:22:42,103
I-I had to put you in it
or I had to watch you be killed.

302
00:22:42,416 --> 00:22:43,906
I had no choice.

303
00:22:44,214 --> 00:22:45,400
I loved you.

304
00:22:46,887 --> 00:22:47,730
You?

305
00:22:48,948 --> 00:22:50,500
You loved me?

306
00:22:51,126 --> 00:22:54,076
I-- I prayed that the gods
would protect you,

307
00:22:54,375 --> 00:22:55,230
and they did.

308
00:22:57,942 --> 00:22:59,126
They brought you home.

309
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:08,192
We have to go. I'm
sorry, Mommy. It was me.

310
00:23:08,192 --> 00:23:11,079
I helped Callisto get out. And
now she's coming for the kids.

311
00:23:11,079 --> 00:23:13,599
We have to go! Come on.
Hurry! No, wait, wait, wait.

312
00:23:13,817 --> 00:23:14,920
Wait.

313
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:17,360
Xena has to know this.
No, Xena hates me!

314
00:23:17,950 --> 00:23:20,451
She doesn't hate you.
She just doesn't understand.

315
00:23:20,796 --> 00:23:24,318
Now she will see what I've
known all along--

316
00:23:25,485 --> 00:23:28,502
that you can fight your
dark side, just like her.

317
00:23:28,766 --> 00:23:30,016
But I'm scared.

318
00:23:30,329 --> 00:23:33,380
If Callisto finds out I told,
she'll kill me! She will!

319
00:23:33,641 --> 00:23:35,219
She will not find out.

320
00:23:35,452 --> 00:23:39,380
I will take you to the safest place
there is until we can go. Okay?

321
00:23:39,703 --> 00:23:40,639
The safest place?

322
00:23:43,047 --> 00:23:45,631
You promise?

323
00:23:46,643 --> 00:23:48,783
I cross my heart.

324
00:23:49,986 --> 00:23:51,609
Don't be afraid. Okay?

325
00:23:52,922 --> 00:23:56,831
Now come with me.
Let's go.

326
00:24:01,394 --> 00:24:03,758
-Almost ready.
-Solan?

327
00:24:09,963 --> 00:24:11,322
That's right.

328
00:24:14,051 --> 00:24:16,488
Safest place there is.

329
00:24:22,945 --> 00:24:24,071
The children?

330
00:24:24,288 --> 00:24:25,383
She's targeting the children?

331
00:24:26,808 --> 00:24:28,391
She's coming from the south.

332
00:24:28,391 --> 00:24:30,767
I'll round up the kids--
get 'em to the caverns.

333
00:24:34,525 --> 00:24:38,457
What makes you think
you can trust this child?

334
00:24:42,121 --> 00:24:44,342
What makes you think that we can't?

335
00:24:47,244 --> 00:24:49,184
Xena, she gave us
Callisto's plan.

336
00:24:49,184 --> 00:24:50,361
Exactly.

337
00:24:50,995 --> 00:24:53,698
Callisto wouldn't tell her anything
she didn't want us to hear.

338
00:24:53,698 --> 00:24:55,809
The child's probably
a pawn or worse!

339
00:24:55,809 --> 00:24:57,392
That is not true.

340
00:24:58,176 --> 00:25:00,804
Xena, you were always so quick
to blame her, weren't you?

341
00:25:00,804 --> 00:25:02,870
Well, she is not evil!
She's not!

342
00:25:04,122 --> 00:25:05,372
Hope?

343
00:25:06,966 --> 00:25:08,612
The child is Hope?

344
00:25:11,581 --> 00:25:14,168
I'm sorry.
I never meant to lie.

345
00:25:15,996 --> 00:25:17,656
Xena, I couldn't kill her.

346
00:25:17,656 --> 00:25:20,676
She's my daughter. You're
a mother. You know this!

347
00:25:21,143 --> 00:25:23,346
-I had to save her.
-Maybe it's not too late.

348
00:25:24,632 --> 00:25:27,269
She's young. Poison'll kill her
if her powers aren't mature.

349
00:25:27,269 --> 00:25:28,520
Poison?

350
00:25:29,197 --> 00:25:32,540
- Xena, she is my child!
- She is not a child!

351
00:25:33,324 --> 00:25:36,394
She is a body, a vessel,
an instrument for evil.

352
00:25:36,394 --> 00:25:38,885
- That is all!
- You are wrong!

353
00:25:39,175 --> 00:25:41,100
Xena, Hope is the victim here!

354
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:44,768
That is why I sent her to Kaleipus's
hut, so she would be safe from Callisto.

355
00:25:46,323 --> 00:25:48,162
You sent her to Kaleipus's hut?

356
00:25:52,043 --> 00:25:53,064
Solan?

357
00:25:59,112 --> 00:25:59,999
Solan?

358
00:26:01,926 --> 00:26:04,709
Hey-- Hey, Solan.

359
00:26:08,153 --> 00:26:09,001
Solan.

360
00:26:18,492 --> 00:26:19,301
Xena?

361
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:20,927
No.

362
00:26:24,063 --> 00:26:24,721
No.

363
00:26:26,843 --> 00:26:27,553
No.

364
00:26:29,392 --> 00:26:30,280
Get out.

365
00:26:32,657 --> 00:26:34,656
- Xena.
- Go!

366
00:26:39,367 --> 00:26:40,188
Solan.

367
00:26:43,502 --> 00:26:45,272
Solan, please.

368
00:26:46,094 --> 00:26:47,500
I'm here now.

369
00:26:49,284 --> 00:26:53,206
Your mom is here now,
just like you always wanted.

370
00:27:20,539 --> 00:27:22,180
Xena, it's Ephiny.

371
00:27:25,235 --> 00:27:26,728
Xena, please.

372
00:27:32,770 --> 00:27:34,354
Go away.

373
00:27:35,853 --> 00:27:38,613
Xena, Callisto's coming.
We need your help.

374
00:27:39,692 --> 00:27:41,706
Go away.

375
00:27:55,144 --> 00:27:56,867
I said get--

376
00:28:05,353 --> 00:28:06,491
Xenon.

377
00:28:50,577 --> 00:28:52,086
Mommy?

378
00:28:53,304 --> 00:28:54,794
What are you doing here?

379
00:28:55,151 --> 00:28:57,264
I thought I told you to wait
in Kaleipus's hut?

380
00:28:57,264 --> 00:29:00,368
I know. But it was awful.
I couldn't stay there!

381
00:29:00,682 --> 00:29:02,085
I was scared!

382
00:29:03,824 --> 00:29:05,008
Why?

383
00:29:06,075 --> 00:29:07,790
-What did you do?
-I ran.

384
00:29:08,661 --> 00:29:11,881
As soon as I got there and saw
that boy dead, I ran and hid.

385
00:29:14,227 --> 00:29:15,193
Hope,

386
00:29:16,051 --> 00:29:18,801
are you saying that he was already
dead when you entered the hut?

387
00:29:18,801 --> 00:29:21,895
I thought Callisto did it,
so I got scared and ran away.

388
00:29:28,942 --> 00:29:30,536
Of course.

389
00:29:31,463 --> 00:29:33,058
It had to be Callisto.

390
00:29:34,770 --> 00:29:36,557
You said that she's
after the children, right?

391
00:29:36,775 --> 00:29:37,845
She is.

392
00:29:39,037 --> 00:29:41,721
So, please,
can we go now?

393
00:29:42,839 --> 00:29:45,243
I don't wanna die like Solan.

394
00:29:47,127 --> 00:29:49,786
How did you know
his name was Solan?

395
00:29:50,379 --> 00:29:52,723
You said so.Remember?

396
00:29:54,006 --> 00:29:56,349
Now, please,can we go?

397
00:29:59,620 --> 00:30:00,873
Yes.

398
00:30:03,387 --> 00:30:05,842
Yes, we'll go.

399
00:30:51,388 --> 00:30:55,402
Hurts, doesn't it,losing your family?

400
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:58,736
Rips out your heart,and your guts.

401
00:30:59,158 --> 00:31:00,446
Your feelings.

402
00:31:01,737 --> 00:31:03,924
All that's left,is the pain, right?

403
00:31:09,415 --> 00:31:10,946
Welcome to the club.

404
00:31:26,793 --> 00:31:27,813
Now!

405
00:31:58,171 --> 00:31:59,263
Fall back!

406
00:32:14,189 --> 00:32:15,796
Go! Take cover!

407
00:32:16,108 --> 00:32:17,141
Retreat!

408
00:32:21,862 --> 00:32:22,494
Hurry!

409
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:31,683
Stupid fools.
I'm doing you a favor.

410
00:32:47,747 --> 00:32:49,292
You'd like to kill me.

411
00:32:51,279 --> 00:32:52,717
Wish you could.

412
00:33:06,843 --> 00:33:08,747
Why drag this out?

413
00:33:09,511 --> 00:33:12,404
Can't you see I bring you
the gift of oblivion?

414
00:33:19,751 --> 00:33:21,543
Come out, come out,
wherever you are.

415
00:33:22,801 --> 00:33:25,811
I promise
it won't hurt... much.

416
00:33:37,796 --> 00:33:39,327
Dead end.

417
00:33:40,151 --> 00:33:41,728
You got that right.

418
00:33:44,184 --> 00:33:46,079
It all ends here with me.

419
00:33:48,643 --> 00:33:50,747
You don't seem to get it,
do you?

420
00:33:54,464 --> 00:33:56,455
You've won.

421
00:33:57,089 --> 00:34:00,514
All these years I've spent
living to destroy you,

422
00:34:01,089 --> 00:34:05,435
thinking that only if I could give
you the same pain that you gave me,

423
00:34:06,248 --> 00:34:07,467
I'd be rid of it,

424
00:34:08,957 --> 00:34:10,872
and life would go on.

425
00:34:11,717 --> 00:34:13,801
And then I do,

426
00:34:13,801 --> 00:34:15,953
and nothing changes.

427
00:34:17,551 --> 00:34:19,301
I don't feel better,

428
00:34:21,593 --> 00:34:23,466
just empty.

429
00:34:26,092 --> 00:34:27,779
So you let me go, Xena.

430
00:34:28,527 --> 00:34:30,875
You can't win this battle.

431
00:34:33,281 --> 00:34:35,216
And you've already won the war.

432
00:34:35,216 --> 00:34:37,376
It's not that simple.
I won't let it be.

433
00:34:52,815 --> 00:34:54,126
I'm warning you, Xena.

434
00:34:54,856 --> 00:34:56,417
You're nothing to me now.

435
00:34:56,762 --> 00:34:58,385
You're breaking my heart.

436
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,230
Walk away.

437
00:35:06,683 --> 00:35:08,445
Go to Tartarus.

438
00:35:31,618 --> 00:35:32,739
Get down!

439
00:35:42,305 --> 00:35:43,388
Run!

440
00:36:16,390 --> 00:36:17,997
You'll trap us both!

441
00:36:19,264 --> 00:36:20,556
That's your plan.

442
00:36:20,837 --> 00:36:25,102
To trap me here while my pain keeps growing
and growing and you die and yours ends.

443
00:36:25,526 --> 00:36:27,120
You're wrong, Callisto.

444
00:36:27,339 --> 00:36:29,652
You let your pain kill you years ago.

445
00:36:29,930 --> 00:36:32,358
I'm gonna live with mine.

446
00:36:59,691 --> 00:37:00,881
Look out!

447
00:37:20,663 --> 00:37:21,602
It's okay.

448
00:39:46,229 --> 00:39:47,123
If--

449
00:39:47,809 --> 00:39:49,372
If I had just done
what you said...

450
00:39:51,462 --> 00:39:54,556
when you told me to do it,
then they would still be alive--

451
00:39:55,809 --> 00:39:57,685
Kaleipus and Solan.

452
00:39:57,892 --> 00:39:58,871
No.

453
00:40:00,812 --> 00:40:05,870
Don't you even
speak his name.

454
00:40:11,810 --> 00:40:13,328
Xena.

455
00:40:13,860 --> 00:40:15,155
No.

456
00:40:17,121 --> 00:40:21,369
No, you lied to me. I trusted
you, and you lied to me.

457
00:40:24,020 --> 00:40:25,653
And now Solan is dead.

458
00:40:29,048 --> 00:40:30,402
My son is dead...

459
00:40:32,236 --> 00:40:33,697
because of you.

460
00:40:46,841 --> 00:40:49,935
I love you, Xena.
