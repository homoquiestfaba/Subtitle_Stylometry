Yeah, man.

27
00:02:37,282 --> 00:02:38,116
Did you see my grades?

28
00:02:38,116 --> 00:02:39,116
You're telling me.

29
00:02:40,493 --> 00:02:42,035
I gotta make a speech in front
of the whole class tomorrow

30
00:02:42,036 --> 00:02:43,579
and I don't even know
what I'm gonna say.

31
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:44,746
That's what happens when
you're a goodie two-shoes

32
00:02:44,747 --> 00:02:46,206
and you wanna be
a valedictorian.

33
00:02:46,207 --> 00:02:47,416
You're just jealous, Eli.

34
00:02:47,417 --> 00:02:48,625
Jealous, I'm
walking with y'all.

35
00:02:48,626 --> 00:02:50,335
Yeah, just barely.

36
00:02:50,336 --> 00:02:51,171
Remember she used
to stay after class

37
00:02:51,172 --> 00:02:52,379
in Mr Wallace's class?

38
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:53,881
To do the extra credit?

39
00:02:53,882 --> 00:02:55,841
Extra credit, man, that
was a crush right there.

40
00:02:55,842 --> 00:02:57,050
A crush.

41
00:02:57,051 --> 00:02:58,302
I did not have
a crush on Mr Wallace.

42
00:02:58,303 --> 00:02:59,803
Well now that
I think about it,

43
00:02:59,804 --> 00:03:01,555
you can't talk,
remember Christie?

44
00:03:01,556 --> 00:03:03,348
The weirded out
girl that likes you?

45
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:04,600
Man, quit with that.

46
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:05,976
Hey, what about that
one girl you liked?

47
00:03:05,977 --> 00:03:06,895
The one with the eye
condition, what was her name?

48
00:03:06,895 --> 00:03:07,729
Oh what was her name?

49
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:08,896
Left eye Susie?

50
00:03:08,897 --> 00:03:10,397
- Yeah.
- Left eye Susie.

51
00:03:10,398 --> 00:03:11,690
She was always looking
in two different directions.

52
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:13,066
No, that's not,
that's not funny,

53
00:03:13,067 --> 00:03:15,235
she had a rare eye
condition, she got it fixed.

54
00:03:15,236 --> 00:03:16,445
Yeah, cause she
was staring at you

55
00:03:16,446 --> 00:03:17,238
and all the other
guys around you, huh.

56
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:18,489
You ain't special.

57
00:03:21,284 --> 00:03:22,702
Hey Blue, what time is it?

58
00:03:24,746 --> 00:03:25,871
Almost noon.

59
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:26,872
Wait, what?

60
00:03:27,749 --> 00:03:28,833
I gotta go guys.

61
00:03:30,418 --> 00:03:32,086
I'll see you guys later.

62
00:03:34,255 --> 00:03:35,173
By Che.

63
00:03:35,174 --> 00:03:37,300
Ayo, Cheo, what's up, man?

64
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:56,610
Hey, what's up young Chip.

65
00:03:56,611 --> 00:03:58,111
How are you, Jeff?

66
00:03:58,112 --> 00:03:59,279
Good, just getting ready
for the big day tomorrow.

67
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,156
Okay, what's new, what's new?

68
00:04:01,157 --> 00:04:05,160
Not much, you know,
just school, music.

69
00:04:05,161 --> 00:04:06,453
How's Christina and
the little homie?

70
00:04:06,454 --> 00:04:08,664
Oh you know,
they're good, man.

71
00:04:08,665 --> 00:04:11,541
Just taking up all my
money playing their sports.

72
00:04:11,542 --> 00:04:13,210
Running me amuck, man.

73
00:04:13,211 --> 00:04:15,379
Speaking of money, I
should charge you double

74
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:18,132
for this haircut, bro, with
that big ol' head of yours.

75
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:21,510
Wow, that is a
double priced head.

76
00:04:21,511 --> 00:04:23,596
Holy tomato, my god, wow.

77
00:04:26,307 --> 00:04:28,809
So any bites in the music
industry, bro, or what?

78
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:30,727
No, I haven't heard
anything back yet.

79
00:04:30,728 --> 00:04:31,979
But I'm starting to think that

80
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:33,313
I need make my own
sound, you know?

81
00:04:33,314 --> 00:04:35,149
Something different
that's just mine.

82
00:04:36,025 --> 00:04:37,943
Yeah man, I don't blame you.

83
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:39,528
Yeah, I'm done with mix tapes.

84
00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:41,405
I want a DJ sampling my music.

85
00:04:41,406 --> 00:04:44,116
Abuelita always said,
work at something you love

86
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:46,034
and you'll never have to
work a day in your life.

87
00:04:46,035 --> 00:04:47,203
Sounds like good advice.

88
00:05:06,681 --> 00:05:07,973
Hey bro, can I help you bro?

89
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:10,475
You get those sideburns
taken off or what bro?

90
00:05:10,476 --> 00:05:11,768
What is your
relationship with the Lord?

91
00:05:11,769 --> 00:05:14,646
Ah man, we don't got
time for that, bro.

92
00:05:14,647 --> 00:05:16,690
Mighty Lord Jesus
Christ says, unless one

93
00:05:16,691 --> 00:05:19,568
is born again, he cannot
see the kingdom of God.

94
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:21,194
Marvel not, I said unto you,

95
00:05:21,195 --> 00:05:23,196
you must be born again.

96
00:05:23,197 --> 00:05:24,865
Hey bro, no one
wants that here.

97
00:05:24,866 --> 00:05:27,117
This is a place of business,
man, get out of here.

98
00:05:27,118 --> 00:05:28,118
Jesus guy.

99
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:30,912
The message of the cross

100
00:05:30,913 --> 00:05:33,165
is foolishness to those
who are perishing,

101
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:34,875
but to us who are being saved,

102
00:05:34,876 --> 00:05:36,002
it is the power of God.

103
00:05:37,295 --> 00:05:38,420
Dude, there's
some bums out there

104
00:05:38,421 --> 00:05:39,380
that need to hear that, bro.

105
00:05:39,381 --> 00:05:41,340
Get out of here with that.

106
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:44,217
Hey Cheo, whatever you do,
don't be like that fool, man.

107
00:05:44,218 --> 00:05:45,218
He's nuts.

108
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:48,930
Okay, Jeff, you've
really outdone yourself.

109
00:05:48,931 --> 00:05:50,140
Yeah, man.

110
00:05:50,141 --> 00:05:51,183
I'm gonna be walking
in the auditorium

111
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:52,434
lookin' firme homes.

112
00:05:52,435 --> 00:05:54,644
Lookin' blessed, homes.

113
00:05:54,645 --> 00:05:56,147
There you go, man.

114
00:05:57,565 --> 00:05:59,024
Ah man, don't worry
about paying me bro.

115
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:00,484
That's your
graduation gift, bro.

116
00:06:00,485 --> 00:06:01,735
Really?

117
00:06:01,736 --> 00:06:02,903
Yeah, we're good
man, we're good.

118
00:06:02,904 --> 00:06:03,821
- Man.
- You know what I'm saying?

119
00:06:03,822 --> 00:06:05,030
Thanks for the love, yo.

120
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:05,698
All right man,
good luck out there.

121
00:06:05,698 --> 00:06:06,616
Orale.

122
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:07,616
All right man, be cool.

123
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:18,835
My head ain't that big, is it?

124
00:06:18,836 --> 00:06:19,836
Nah.

125
00:06:25,927 --> 00:06:26,927
What up, bro?

126
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:29,471
Hey, what's up
Cheo, how's it going?

127
00:06:29,472 --> 00:06:32,140
Not much, just got back
from the barber shop.

128
00:06:32,141 --> 00:06:33,101
Big day tomorrow, huh?

129
00:06:33,102 --> 00:06:34,351
Definitely.

130
00:06:34,352 --> 00:06:35,560
You ready?

131
00:06:35,561 --> 00:06:37,313
I don't know,
this beat is tight.

132
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:41,024
What you know about this song?

133
00:06:41,025 --> 00:06:44,111
Well when Rocky came out,
it really stuck with me.

134
00:06:44,112 --> 00:06:46,279
I was looking all over for it.

135
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,948
Kool and the Gang
released that song

136
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:49,533
a few years before Rocky,

137
00:06:49,534 --> 00:06:52,328
on Light of the World, now
that's a must have album.

138
00:06:53,621 --> 00:06:55,288
Yeah, I'll check it out.

139
00:06:55,289 --> 00:06:57,499
Hey, is this any good?

140
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:58,959
Haven't had a chance
to listen to it yet

141
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,794
but let's slap that bad boy on.

142
00:07:00,795 --> 00:07:01,795
Sweet.

143
00:07:20,815 --> 00:07:21,815
Yeah.

144
00:07:23,192 --> 00:07:24,777
He's got himself a nice hook.

145
00:07:25,987 --> 00:07:29,906
This is where
they get it from.

146
00:07:29,907 --> 00:07:30,992
Good call on this one.

147
00:07:32,368 --> 00:07:33,994
So I hear around
the neighborhood

148
00:07:33,995 --> 00:07:35,662
that you wanna get into music.

149
00:07:35,663 --> 00:07:37,790
Yeah, got any advice?

150
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:42,502
Well, what you know
about Miles Davis?

151
00:07:42,503 --> 00:07:43,503
Who?

152
00:07:43,504 --> 00:07:44,963
Duke Ellington?

153
00:07:44,964 --> 00:07:46,631
James Brown, godfather of soul?

154
00:07:46,632 --> 00:07:47,632
You know.

155
00:07:48,843 --> 00:07:50,302
No, bro.

156
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:52,179
Ah Cheo, come on kid.

157
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:53,930
You gotta know the past
before you can help create

158
00:07:53,931 --> 00:07:55,182
the future.

159
00:07:55,183 --> 00:07:56,349
How can you be the
best at what you do

160
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:58,311
if you're not familiar
with the greats?

161
00:08:00,771 --> 00:08:02,939
You got me there,
you're right, bro.

162
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:03,900
Hold on, wait
here, I got something

163
00:08:03,901 --> 00:08:05,485
for you, be right back.

164
00:08:15,036 --> 00:08:17,037
Take these records
home for a few days

165
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:19,372
and learn about some real music.

166
00:08:19,373 --> 00:08:20,624
Really?

167
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:21,542
Yeah, this here
is gonna take you

168
00:08:21,543 --> 00:08:23,168
to another level.

169
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:26,005
These are better than
any college music course.

170
00:08:27,298 --> 00:08:29,049
Sweet, thanks Roland,

171
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:30,926
they're in good
hands, I promise.

172
00:08:30,927 --> 00:08:32,844
Okay, get out of here, I
gotta get some work done.

173
00:08:32,845 --> 00:08:34,764
All right, Roland,
talk to you later.

174
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:56,786
Hey, Cheo, what's up?

175
00:08:59,747 --> 00:09:00,872
Comin' from school?

176
00:09:00,873 --> 00:09:03,250
Yeah, just got out of class.

177
00:09:03,251 --> 00:09:04,751
You been skippin'?

178
00:09:04,752 --> 00:09:07,754
Man, that counselor, Mr.
McCann, he be trippin' bro.

179
00:09:07,755 --> 00:09:09,631
Straight up cheating
off of credits.

180
00:09:09,632 --> 00:09:11,758
Talkin' about how I
gotta take summer school.

181
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:13,343
I didn't want to be
there to begin with,

182
00:09:13,344 --> 00:09:15,263
now he wants me to
take summer school?

183
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:17,430
Chale homes.

184
00:09:17,431 --> 00:09:18,765
Maybe if you weren't skipping,

185
00:09:18,766 --> 00:09:20,268
you'd be graduating tomorrow.

186
00:09:21,435 --> 00:09:23,353
School ain't for
everybody carnal,

187
00:09:23,354 --> 00:09:25,855
we'll be here workin'
the Low Low's for now.

188
00:09:25,856 --> 00:09:27,536
Let me see what records
you picked up, man.

189
00:09:29,777 --> 00:09:32,446
Hey, who is John Col-tran?

190
00:09:33,322 --> 00:09:34,573
I don't know, some jazz guy.

191
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:36,575
Roland gave me these
records to listen to.

192
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:38,493
Says I should study up on them.

193
00:09:38,494 --> 00:09:40,287
That same junk that
Beethoven was playing?

194
00:09:40,288 --> 00:09:41,788
Beethoven?

195
00:09:41,789 --> 00:09:44,833
Sad girl, he likes that
Beethoven music that you do.

196
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:47,128
It's not classical
music, stupid.

197
00:09:49,797 --> 00:09:51,172
That's jazz.

198
00:09:51,173 --> 00:09:52,799
Same junk, right?

199
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,552
Hey, you ain't got no
oldies or soul up in there.

200
00:09:55,553 --> 00:09:58,054
Nah, that's not the
style I'm kinda goin' for.

201
00:09:58,055 --> 00:10:01,516
But hey, I'll see you Chava,
I gotta run, all right.

202
00:10:01,517 --> 00:10:03,768
How come you don't like
to hang out with us anymore?

203
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:06,147
Big Happy, give Cheo
a sip of your 40.

204
00:10:09,358 --> 00:10:10,525
I'm good.

205
00:10:10,526 --> 00:10:11,860
Hey Sad Girl,
think Cheo might need

206
00:10:11,861 --> 00:10:13,820
a little tenderness.

207
00:10:13,821 --> 00:10:15,530
Bet you know who sang that song.

208
00:10:15,531 --> 00:10:16,990
Odis Redding, bro.

209
00:10:16,991 --> 00:10:20,744
And hey, I'm cool Julie,
I've got a big day tomorrow.

210
00:10:20,745 --> 00:10:22,287
It's Sad Girl, Cheo.

211
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:23,748
No disrespect Julie.

212
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:26,875
All right then bro, next time,

213
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:28,376
hang out for a little bit.

214
00:10:28,377 --> 00:10:30,420
Startin' to think you
don't like us, homes.

215
00:10:30,421 --> 00:10:32,464
Come on bro, we
grew up together.

216
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:35,216
I'm trying to get to bed
early tonight, all right.

217
00:10:35,217 --> 00:10:36,635
Hey, want one?

218
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:38,011
Nah, I'm cool.

219
00:10:38,012 --> 00:10:40,013
You always do
straight leg stuff.

220
00:10:40,014 --> 00:10:42,515
Enjoy your classical
music and Col-tran.

221
00:10:42,516 --> 00:10:45,936
Col-tran, Chava, you need
to expand your horizons, man.

222
00:10:56,405 --> 00:10:58,865
I hear you're gonna
graduate tomorrow, baby.

223
00:10:58,866 --> 00:10:59,866
Hi Ms. Mary.

224
00:11:02,787 --> 00:11:03,787
How's it going?

225
00:11:06,874 --> 00:11:10,126
I am so proud of you.

226
00:11:10,127 --> 00:11:12,796
I sure wish Mr. Reuben was
here to see you graduate.

227
00:11:12,797 --> 00:11:15,215
I wish he was here as well,

228
00:11:15,216 --> 00:11:17,008
I remember him telling
me all the stories.

229
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:18,885
Yeah, yeah.

230
00:11:18,886 --> 00:11:20,595
You got some new records there?

231
00:11:20,596 --> 00:11:21,596
Yeah.

232
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:24,475
Is that Duke Ellington
you're holding?

233
00:11:25,393 --> 00:11:27,435
Roland said he
was a must have.

234
00:11:27,436 --> 00:11:29,396
Well, make sure
you open your window

235
00:11:29,397 --> 00:11:31,314
when you playing the Duke.

236
00:11:31,315 --> 00:11:33,901
Reuben sure did
love Duke Ellington.

237
00:11:34,777 --> 00:11:35,777
Will do Ms. Mary.

238
00:11:36,904 --> 00:11:37,904
Yo Cheo?

239
00:11:40,241 --> 00:11:42,243
I gotta go, okay,
have a good day.

240
00:11:50,459 --> 00:11:51,543
My brother, my brother.

241
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:52,378
What up E?

242
00:11:52,379 --> 00:11:53,837
Sup man.

243
00:11:53,838 --> 00:11:55,088
Ay yo, what you got, you
always got the good with you.

244
00:11:55,089 --> 00:11:56,214
Bro, check this out.

245
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:57,215
So I went down to the shop today

246
00:11:57,216 --> 00:11:59,175
and Roland really hooked us up.

247
00:11:59,176 --> 00:12:02,011
Gave me a couple records to
listen to some new sound,

248
00:12:02,012 --> 00:12:03,179
he says if we really
wanna make it into

249
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:04,723
this music business,
we gotta know

250
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:05,974
where the music originated.

251
00:12:05,975 --> 00:12:07,183
Whoa hold up, man, Roland did?

252
00:12:07,184 --> 00:12:09,769
Man that guy never let's
me borrow anything.

253
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:12,272
Bro, chill out, there's
a first for everything.

254
00:12:12,273 --> 00:12:13,274
Let's go to my crib.

255
00:12:32,209 --> 00:12:33,585
Bro, you stink bro.

256
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:35,670
Man, dude, your room smells.

257
00:12:35,671 --> 00:12:39,007
Let's see, yo, think fast E.

258
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:41,510
Man, quit with that,
you're always playin' around.

259
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:47,932
Yo, you hungry?

260
00:12:47,933 --> 00:12:49,309
We got some nice
juicy tortillas.

261
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:51,395
Nah man, I'm
good, I already ate.

262
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:58,527
You know, actually
bring me some juice.

263
00:13:03,866 --> 00:13:04,991
Yo, E.

264
00:13:04,992 --> 00:13:06,159
- Sup man.
- Here you go bro.

265
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,119
- Thanks man.
- Yeah.

266
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,496
Yo this is fresh.

267
00:13:09,497 --> 00:13:10,456
Yeah.

268
00:13:10,457 --> 00:13:11,831
Man this is fresh.

269
00:13:11,832 --> 00:13:12,832
Yes.

270
00:13:15,586 --> 00:13:17,087
Yo bro, that's the breakdown.

271
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:20,089
Pretty cool.

272
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:22,009
Yeah that one.

273
00:13:23,177 --> 00:13:24,886
Come on, I need
the headphones too.

274
00:13:24,887 --> 00:13:26,013
Your old headphones?

275
00:13:26,931 --> 00:13:28,431
Just get the headphones.

276
00:13:28,432 --> 00:13:31,017
Man, I told you you should
get new ones already, man.

277
00:13:31,018 --> 00:13:33,102
You wanna buy 'em?

278
00:13:33,103 --> 00:13:34,897
Man, here, listen
to your music.

279
00:13:41,612 --> 00:13:42,863
Ah, check it.

280
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:53,289
Yo, man we gon'
definitely have a good night

281
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:54,541
full of something like this.

282
00:13:54,542 --> 00:13:56,376
Bro, I'm telling you,
this is gonna change

283
00:13:56,377 --> 00:13:58,127
the direction of
our lives in music.

284
00:13:58,128 --> 00:13:59,046
All right, let's
see, let's see.

285
00:13:59,047 --> 00:14:00,965
Hey throw the next one on.

286
00:14:05,469 --> 00:14:06,469
You got it?

287
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:07,470
Yep, play it.

288
00:14:10,057 --> 00:14:13,059
Oh okay, this is a
game changer, boy.

289
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:14,060
Give me that.

290
00:14:22,736 --> 00:14:23,736
Man what is this?

291
00:14:25,573 --> 00:14:27,907
Yo, Roland gave me this track.

292
00:14:27,908 --> 00:14:29,284
This is the game changer bro,

293
00:14:29,285 --> 00:14:32,078
listen to the arrangements,
something different.

294
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:34,289
The arrangements, the
pacing and the timing,

295
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:35,456
something new.

296
00:14:35,457 --> 00:14:36,958
Man, are we listening
to the same track?

297
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:38,751
We'll never get another
gig if we play this crap.

298
00:14:38,752 --> 00:14:40,295
What are you talking about?

299
00:14:40,296 --> 00:14:42,589
This is art, man,
clean out your ears.

300
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:45,091
Dude, how we gon'
use stuff like this?

301
00:14:45,092 --> 00:14:46,092
You gotta think
outside the box.

302
00:14:46,093 --> 00:14:47,844
We do pretty well DJing man.

303
00:14:47,845 --> 00:14:49,679
Yeah but, it's
already played out,

304
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:50,598
I'm trying to do my
own thing, don't you?

305
00:14:50,599 --> 00:14:52,015
What you mean your own thing?

306
00:14:52,016 --> 00:14:54,225
Oh think you're a hot
stuff without me, huh?

307
00:14:54,226 --> 00:14:56,477
Nah, man I'm just saying
I wanna do something new.

308
00:14:56,478 --> 00:14:58,104
Something that gets my
creative juices flowing.

309
00:14:58,105 --> 00:14:59,397
Well if we play
stuff like this,

310
00:14:59,398 --> 00:15:00,857
your fan base is gonna
be people who are like,

311
00:15:00,858 --> 00:15:02,400
people like Ms. Mary, man.

312
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:04,402
Oh you'll definitely be a
hit at the senior center.

313
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:05,612
Bro, you're taking

314
00:15:05,613 --> 00:15:06,863
this a little too
personally, man.

315
00:15:06,864 --> 00:15:08,072
I'm just trying
to mix things up.

316
00:15:08,073 --> 00:15:09,282
Well maybe we should
do our own thing.

317
00:15:09,283 --> 00:15:10,742
I do all the scratching
at the gigs anyway.

318
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:11,577
Hey man, back off.

319
00:15:11,578 --> 00:15:12,785
Hey man.

320
00:15:12,786 --> 00:15:14,245
Eli, whoa, why
you shoving me man,

321
00:15:14,246 --> 00:15:15,747
why you getting so mad?

322
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:16,956
Yeah bro, you made it
pretty clear you wanna do

323
00:15:16,957 --> 00:15:17,875
your own thing with
your own sound,

324
00:15:17,876 --> 00:15:19,083
you know, I'ma help you out,

325
00:15:19,084 --> 00:15:20,585
I'ma open up this
window, so you can play

326
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:23,004
this trash so Ms.
Mary can listen to it.

327
00:15:23,005 --> 00:15:24,255
Bro stop being like this.

328
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:25,465
Nah man, I thought
you were different

329
00:15:25,466 --> 00:15:27,050
but I guess you're on
Cloud 9 since graduation

330
00:15:27,051 --> 00:15:29,052
is tomorrow and you've already
decided to leave me behind

331
00:15:29,053 --> 00:15:30,136
when you're done with Jefferson.

332
00:15:30,137 --> 00:15:31,846
Bro, you're not even,

333
00:15:31,847 --> 00:15:33,514
what is going on?

334
00:15:33,515 --> 00:15:34,974
Nah bro, you've
done lost your mind.

335
00:15:34,975 --> 00:15:36,142
You don't have to
do this old music

336
00:15:36,143 --> 00:15:37,393
to be better than you.

337
00:15:37,394 --> 00:15:38,937
You had no talent
when we started

338
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:40,647
and this, this ain't gon'
help you out one bit, man.

339
00:15:40,648 --> 00:15:41,856
One bit.

340
00:15:41,857 --> 00:15:42,900
You know I'm out man.

341
00:15:43,817 --> 00:15:44,817
E, yo!

342
00:15:47,071 --> 00:15:48,279
You know what, that
wasn't my intention at all

343
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:49,322
but you want it to be that way

344
00:15:49,323 --> 00:15:50,782
then fine, E, go ahead,

345
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:51,991
do your own thing man,

346
00:15:51,992 --> 00:15:53,242
you're done with
this for some reason

347
00:15:53,243 --> 00:15:55,245
so I'll just stand
back and do mine.

348
00:16:30,572 --> 00:16:34,534
In all these years
I've known you and Eli,

349
00:16:34,535 --> 00:16:37,787
never once have I
ever, ever heard

350
00:16:37,788 --> 00:16:40,123
you guys exchange
words like that.

351
00:16:40,124 --> 00:16:43,626
Oh it hurts my heart
to hear you two argue.

352
00:16:43,627 --> 00:16:46,462
You know, Cheo, the
Lord says there's

353
00:16:46,463 --> 00:16:49,382
a friend who sticks
closer than a brother.

354
00:16:49,383 --> 00:16:52,176
And no matter life
throws at you,

355
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:54,804
you love that boy,
you love that boy

356
00:16:54,805 --> 00:16:56,807
like you do your
own blood brothers.

357
00:16:58,267 --> 00:17:01,436
Yes ma'am, I've gone through
most of my life with him,

358
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:03,563
I don't know what happened.

359
00:17:03,564 --> 00:17:04,523
I don't think he
was a huge fan of

360
00:17:04,524 --> 00:17:05,858
those records I brought home.

361
00:17:06,984 --> 00:17:08,568
I have a bunch of old
records just sitting

362
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:10,737
in the garage if you
wanna take them with you.

363
00:17:10,738 --> 00:17:12,405
Really?

364
00:17:12,406 --> 00:17:13,406
Yeah.

365
00:17:36,305 --> 00:17:38,474
Right through that door.

366
00:17:52,237 --> 00:17:53,781
Right on the shelf by the wall.

367
00:17:57,993 --> 00:18:00,120
Right on the top
shelf, sweetheart.

368
00:18:11,006 --> 00:18:14,384
Whoa, you got a great
collection Ms. Mary.

369
00:18:15,552 --> 00:18:17,136
You can take them
with you, sweetheart.

370
00:18:17,137 --> 00:18:20,307
Reuben would be happy that
you're listening to his music.

371
00:18:21,683 --> 00:18:25,478
I have my radio now so I
don't play records anymore.

372
00:18:25,479 --> 00:18:26,980
That was Reuben's thing.

373
00:18:28,315 --> 00:18:29,565
Are you sure?

374
00:18:29,566 --> 00:18:31,067
This is a lot of records.

375
00:18:31,068 --> 00:18:34,237
You could probably make some
good money off of these.

376
00:18:34,238 --> 00:18:36,990
Yeah, but I'd rather
keep them in the family.

377
00:18:41,161 --> 00:18:43,580
Thank you Ms. Mary,
I'll put them to good use.

378
00:18:45,874 --> 00:18:47,376
Oh and one last thing,

379
00:18:50,587 --> 00:18:52,548
you know sometimes in life,

380
00:18:53,757 --> 00:18:55,883
people aren't gonna
like what you like.

381
00:18:55,884 --> 00:18:57,927
And that's okay.

382
00:18:57,928 --> 00:19:00,388
But you have to
embrace the differences

383
00:19:00,389 --> 00:19:01,389
in people.

384
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:05,101
But don't compromise
your choices

385
00:19:05,102 --> 00:19:07,728
while embracing theirs baby.

386
00:19:07,729 --> 00:19:11,023
Now you go get some rest
for your graduation tomorrow

387
00:19:11,024 --> 00:19:12,568
and have a blessed day.

388
00:19:13,694 --> 00:19:15,279
Will do, Ms. Mary, thank you.

389
00:19:41,722 --> 00:19:46,685
Hey Cheo, Cheo!

390
00:19:50,147 --> 00:19:51,231
Hey can you come down?

391
00:19:52,649 --> 00:19:53,649
Yeah, hold up.

392
00:20:11,251 --> 00:20:12,335
Hey, what up Blue?

393
00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:13,336
Hey.

394
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:15,880
You okay, Che?

395
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:18,049
Yeah, I'm all right.

396
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:19,134
I've had better days.

397
00:20:20,093 --> 00:20:21,011
I also got some new records

398
00:20:21,012 --> 00:20:22,929
from Roland and Ms. Mary.

399
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:24,096
Yeah, I heard
you down the street

400
00:20:24,097 --> 00:20:25,932
with the East Side Boys
going over records.

401
00:20:25,933 --> 00:20:29,769
I also heard that Sad
Girl's all over you.

402
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:31,020
You got it for her now,

403
00:20:31,021 --> 00:20:33,356
cause I thought we
made a marriage pact.

404
00:20:33,357 --> 00:20:34,316
Me?

405
00:20:34,317 --> 00:20:35,816
I'm never getting married.

406
00:20:35,817 --> 00:20:37,611
Plus who marries
they're best friend?

407
00:20:39,947 --> 00:20:41,865
Well I'm holding up
my side of the deal.

408
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:46,535
Oh I finished that poem
that I told you about.

409
00:20:46,536 --> 00:20:47,871
Will you help me go over it?

410
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:51,540
Wait, what poem?

411
00:20:51,541 --> 00:20:53,459
The one I've been telling
you about for like two weeks.

412
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:54,460
Dude, what's wrong?

413
00:20:55,879 --> 00:20:57,838
I'm sorry Blue, it's
just that me and Eli

414
00:20:57,839 --> 00:21:01,676
had a huge fall out and I
don't understand what happened.

415
00:21:01,677 --> 00:21:02,552
I brought some records home

416
00:21:02,553 --> 00:21:04,387
and we just got into it.

417
00:21:04,388 --> 00:21:05,680
Yeah, I heard.

418
00:21:05,681 --> 00:21:07,390
Who told you about it?

419
00:21:07,391 --> 00:21:09,100
No one, these
walls are paper thin,

420
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:10,351
I can hear everything.

421
00:21:10,352 --> 00:21:11,937
Well what else did you hear?

422
00:21:13,647 --> 00:21:15,273
Just that Sad
Girl's all over you

423
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:17,733
like a cheap suit,
look like you liked it.

424
00:21:17,734 --> 00:21:20,653
She was just looking
at the records I got.

425
00:21:20,654 --> 00:21:21,654
Mhm.

426
00:21:23,156 --> 00:21:25,616
You know what Blue, I
don't know how you do it

427
00:21:25,617 --> 00:21:26,993
but you always make
it seem like you

428
00:21:26,994 --> 00:21:28,953
and I are in a relationship.

429
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:30,956
I don't have time for
no Sad Girl crush.

430
00:21:38,171 --> 00:21:39,506
What records did you get?

431
00:21:40,924 --> 00:21:42,466
Too many to list.

432
00:21:42,467 --> 00:21:44,343
I actually just got done
listening to a few tracks

433
00:21:44,344 --> 00:21:45,762
and I already feel inspired.

434
00:21:46,847 --> 00:21:47,847
It's crazy.

435
00:21:49,224 --> 00:21:51,600
You know you're really cute
when you talk about music.

436
00:21:51,601 --> 00:21:52,852
Oh gosh.

437
00:21:52,853 --> 00:21:53,853
I'm serious.

438
00:21:53,854 --> 00:21:55,272
I know, that's the problem.

439
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:05,823
You know, Che, you and
Eli are better friends

440
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:07,283
than that.

441
00:22:07,284 --> 00:22:09,035
Things will get better,
just give it time.

442
00:22:09,036 --> 00:22:10,036
Yeah.

443
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:16,043
Can you come out tonight?

444
00:22:16,044 --> 00:22:17,835
I wanna show you something.

445
00:22:17,836 --> 00:22:19,211
What do you wanna show me?

446
00:22:19,212 --> 00:22:20,212
It's a surprise.

447
00:22:22,174 --> 00:22:23,174
Go get your jacket.

448
00:22:24,718 --> 00:22:26,218
I think I can.

449
00:22:26,219 --> 00:22:27,511
Shouldn't be out
too long though,

450
00:22:27,512 --> 00:22:28,347
dinner's gonna be
ready soon, okay?

451
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:29,222
Okay.

452
00:22:29,223 --> 00:22:30,724
Be back.

453
00:22:34,478 --> 00:22:36,020
Okay so what's up with
these records you got.

454
00:22:36,021 --> 00:22:38,439
Which ones did you get, you
never told me the names?

455
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:40,775
Well I did get a
couple from Mr. Roland

456
00:22:40,776 --> 00:22:42,485
and from Ms. Mary.

457
00:22:42,486 --> 00:22:43,403
Yeah, yeah, you
said that, but what?

458
00:22:43,404 --> 00:22:46,238
What records, like what bands?

459
00:22:46,239 --> 00:22:47,323
Right, right.

460
00:22:47,324 --> 00:22:48,783
Duke Ellington.
Okay.

461
00:22:48,784 --> 00:22:50,242
Miles Davis.

462
00:22:50,243 --> 00:22:51,494
I recognize that one.

463
00:22:51,495 --> 00:22:53,788
And then, what
was the last one?

464
00:22:53,789 --> 00:22:56,041
I know, I know, what was it?

465
00:23:02,672 --> 00:23:04,508
Where'd you find this?

466
00:23:07,177 --> 00:23:08,720
I want a low rider one day.

467
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:11,556
How'd you find this?

468
00:23:12,933 --> 00:23:14,935
Will and his friends
did it, cool huh?

469
00:23:16,186 --> 00:23:17,186
This is tight.

470
00:23:18,355 --> 00:23:20,649
Is it a '65 Lincoln Continental?

471
00:23:22,275 --> 00:23:24,111
'64, look at the tail lights.

472
00:23:28,281 --> 00:23:30,826
Okay Blue, I see you
know your low riders.

473
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,622
I'm telling you, we're
rolling in one soon.

474
00:23:37,791 --> 00:23:39,834
All good things come
to those that wait.

475
00:23:39,835 --> 00:23:41,335
And have money.

476
00:23:41,336 --> 00:23:43,462
Remember, these cars
ain't cheap anymore.

477
00:23:43,463 --> 00:23:45,881
Especially when
they're all hooked up.

478
00:23:45,882 --> 00:23:47,217
You don't need hydraulic.

479
00:23:48,135 --> 00:23:49,469
But you want 'em, I guess.

480
00:23:51,138 --> 00:23:52,138
Yo, Cheo.

481
00:23:55,767 --> 00:23:57,017
Sup, dude.

482
00:23:57,018 --> 00:23:59,478
Happy to see you here.

483
00:23:59,479 --> 00:24:00,479
Yo, back off.

484
00:24:03,024 --> 00:24:05,025
You're in good hands here.

485
00:24:05,026 --> 00:24:07,821
She just makes it a little
nicer here, that's all, boy.

486
00:24:09,656 --> 00:24:12,533
All right man, we
were just leaving.

487
00:24:12,534 --> 00:24:16,162
Hey Cheo, tell you brother
Vinicio said what's up.

488
00:24:16,163 --> 00:24:18,080
You need to hang
out with us again.

489
00:24:18,081 --> 00:24:20,292
Us East Side Boys, you
know what I'm saying?

490
00:24:21,501 --> 00:24:23,128
All right man, let's go.

491
00:24:30,594 --> 00:24:32,512
Love watching
you walk away girl.

492
00:24:46,776 --> 00:24:47,943
What you guys do today?

493
00:24:47,944 --> 00:24:49,362
Some new music comps.

494
00:24:50,363 --> 00:24:52,032
Played some games.

495
00:24:55,035 --> 00:24:56,035
Here you go boys.

496
00:24:56,036 --> 00:24:57,412
Thank you mama.

497
00:25:05,504 --> 00:25:06,671
Thank you mom.

498
00:25:08,131 --> 00:25:09,633
Vini, put your phone down.

499
00:25:12,093 --> 00:25:13,093
This again?

500
00:25:14,137 --> 00:25:16,555
Everyone else eats
nice meals every night.

501
00:25:16,556 --> 00:25:17,849
Plus there's never enough.

502
00:25:18,975 --> 00:25:20,434
It's not enough?

503
00:25:20,435 --> 00:25:22,228
Not enough, Vinicio?

504
00:25:22,229 --> 00:25:24,897
I already work two jobs.

505
00:25:24,898 --> 00:25:27,107
Why don't you just
get another job, ma?

506
00:25:27,108 --> 00:25:28,692
Yo, Vinnie, shut up.

507
00:25:28,693 --> 00:25:30,070
Why you always complaining?

508
00:25:33,573 --> 00:25:35,616
If we were white,
we'd have more money

509
00:25:35,617 --> 00:25:36,910
and we'd have better food.

510
00:25:38,328 --> 00:25:40,079
If you don't like it then you
can get out of here Vinicio!

511
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,081
I've had enough.

512
00:25:42,207 --> 00:25:44,583
You should be thankful
I didn't hit you.

513
00:25:44,584 --> 00:25:45,960
You got anything else to say?

514
00:25:45,961 --> 00:25:47,545
I blame dad for
ruining this family.

515
00:25:47,546 --> 00:25:50,006
You never take responsibility
for your actions.

516
00:25:51,258 --> 00:25:52,466
Enough Jorge Emilio.

517
00:25:52,467 --> 00:25:53,926
It's true mama.

518
00:25:53,927 --> 00:25:55,427
Why is it that every
time you guys get into it,

519
00:25:55,428 --> 00:25:56,929
you always have to bring up dad.

520
00:25:56,930 --> 00:26:00,057
Quit defending him Cheo,
he doesn't care about you.

521
00:26:00,058 --> 00:26:01,267
What makes you think that?

522
00:26:01,268 --> 00:26:02,768
He's always happy to see me.

523
00:26:02,769 --> 00:26:05,104
It's a just front
Cheo, he doesn't love you

524
00:26:05,105 --> 00:26:07,690
and he didn't love mom and
he doesn't love any of us.

525
00:26:07,691 --> 00:26:09,108
That's not true.

526
00:26:09,109 --> 00:26:10,359
Oh yeah, then why
hasn't he come visited us

527
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:11,777
in years and he only
lives two blocks away.

528
00:26:11,778 --> 00:26:13,153
You see what you did,

529
00:26:13,154 --> 00:26:14,780
this is why we
don't bring him up.

530
00:26:14,781 --> 00:26:17,783
He's not a father figure,
he only cares about himself.

531
00:26:17,784 --> 00:26:19,326
He's just nothing but
an abusive piece of...

532
00:26:19,327 --> 00:26:20,327
Sit down!

533
00:26:26,668 --> 00:26:29,295
Well I'm thankful
for what we have.

534
00:26:29,296 --> 00:26:30,755
Thank you Cheo.

535
00:26:34,009 --> 00:26:35,676
Mama, tus frijoles
son los mejores.

536
00:26:35,677 --> 00:26:37,177
I can't get enough of 'em.

537
00:26:37,178 --> 00:26:38,597
We just had it last night.

538
00:26:54,487 --> 00:26:56,196
Cheo, mijo, there's
a package for you,

539
00:26:56,197 --> 00:26:57,991
please get it out
of the doorway.

540
00:27:11,713 --> 00:27:13,339
Who would bring you something?

541
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:14,633
I don't know.

542
00:27:17,802 --> 00:27:18,678
What does the box say?

543
00:27:18,678 --> 00:27:19,678
Where's it from?

544
00:27:20,764 --> 00:27:22,015
Okinawa, Japan.

545
00:27:23,391 --> 00:27:24,850
Okinawa, Japan?

546
00:27:24,851 --> 00:27:25,851
That's Jetty.

547
00:27:27,145 --> 00:27:29,689
Oh you know how expensive
that postage must've been?

548
00:27:32,567 --> 00:27:34,694
Mom, you're right,
it is from Jetty.

549
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:45,205
It was him.

550
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:50,209
Cheo, I'm sending you
this keyboard from Japan.

551
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:51,877
By the time you
receive this package,

552
00:27:51,878 --> 00:27:53,837
it'll be three
months later for me.

553
00:27:53,838 --> 00:27:56,256
Make your own music,
you have it in you,

554
00:27:56,257 --> 00:27:57,883
and this should
help you get there.

555
00:27:57,884 --> 00:28:00,469
I love you guys and
miss you all so much.

556
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:03,847
Take care of mom, I'll
be home soon, Jetty.

557
00:28:03,848 --> 00:28:06,226
P.S. happy graduation.

558
00:28:07,686 --> 00:28:10,062
Que regalo, Cheo!

559
00:28:10,063 --> 00:28:12,148
A keyboard, how did he know?

560
00:28:13,316 --> 00:28:14,817
It's definitely
no boxing glove

561
00:28:14,818 --> 00:28:16,361
but hey, it looks expensive.

562
00:28:17,445 --> 00:28:20,740
Man, so what the
hell did Jetty send us?

563
00:28:22,117 --> 00:28:24,284
Don't let your brothers
mess with this gift.

564
00:28:24,285 --> 00:28:26,370
Your brother Jetty worked
very hard to be able

565
00:28:26,371 --> 00:28:27,913
to send this to you.

566
00:28:27,914 --> 00:28:28,914
I will mama.

567
00:28:34,129 --> 00:28:35,463
I'm a free man, Roland.

568
00:28:36,923 --> 00:28:39,883
Hey look at this guy, all
graduatin' and everything.

569
00:28:39,884 --> 00:28:40,884
Good for you kid.

570
00:28:43,972 --> 00:28:46,223
Could've kept these records
for more than one night.

571
00:28:46,224 --> 00:28:48,058
Yeah, I know.

572
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:48,893
How'd you like 'em?

573
00:28:48,894 --> 00:28:50,644
Man these were sick.

574
00:28:50,645 --> 00:28:52,563
They changed everything.

575
00:28:52,564 --> 00:28:53,731
I feel like I can
really use these

576
00:28:53,732 --> 00:28:54,899
to make something dope.

577
00:28:56,067 --> 00:28:58,068
And what
stood out most to you?

578
00:28:58,069 --> 00:28:59,903
That's gotta be
a trick question.

579
00:28:59,904 --> 00:29:04,408
Well, Miles gave the
Duke a run for his money

580
00:29:04,409 --> 00:29:06,952
but the Duke dealt
with an entire Big Band

581
00:29:06,953 --> 00:29:08,538
so I gotta give it to the Duke.

582
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:11,749
Miles?

583
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:13,000
The Duke?

584
00:29:13,001 --> 00:29:15,836
We're on a first name
basis after one night?

585
00:29:15,837 --> 00:29:17,629
Well, Ms. Mary gave me a bunch

586
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:19,798
of Mr. Reuben's old records.

587
00:29:19,799 --> 00:29:23,135
Ah, Ms. Mary, of course.

588
00:29:23,136 --> 00:29:24,470
Tell me more.

589
00:29:24,471 --> 00:29:27,306
Well, Miles got this
straight up funk to it's sound,

590
00:29:27,307 --> 00:29:31,560
but James Brown, took that
funk to a whole 'nother level.

591
00:29:31,561 --> 00:29:34,605
I don't know, I guess
I just love it all.

592
00:29:34,606 --> 00:29:35,814
Damn boy, look at you here

593
00:29:35,815 --> 00:29:37,149
with your high school diploma

594
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:38,985
and your knowledge
for proper tunes.

595
00:29:40,403 --> 00:29:43,197
Welp, I couldn't have
done it without you, Roland.

596
00:29:43,198 --> 00:29:44,615
It ain't everyday
I find someone bit

597
00:29:44,616 --> 00:29:46,700
with the same music bug as me.

598
00:29:46,701 --> 00:29:49,495
Now, go do somethin'
big with it.

599
00:29:49,496 --> 00:29:50,497
That's my plan.

600
00:29:54,292 --> 00:29:55,501
Hey Roland.

601
00:29:55,502 --> 00:29:56,710
Hey what's up, Eli.

602
00:29:56,711 --> 00:29:58,170
Hey so what was up
with those records

603
00:29:58,171 --> 00:29:59,671
you let Cheo borrow, you
never let me borrow anything.

604
00:29:59,672 --> 00:30:00,714
How'd you like 'em?

605
00:30:00,715 --> 00:30:01,674
Want me to be honest?

606
00:30:01,674 --> 00:30:02,592
My dad would have liked them.

607
00:30:02,593 --> 00:30:03,713
But it wasn't my cup of tea.

608
00:30:05,136 --> 00:30:06,845
You gotta expand
your mind, boy.

609
00:30:06,846 --> 00:30:09,014
So where do you think most
of the sounds come from,

610
00:30:09,015 --> 00:30:10,432
from today?

611
00:30:10,433 --> 00:30:11,600
I don't know, man, artists
make them up, I guess.

612
00:30:11,601 --> 00:30:13,644
Oh no, no, no.

613
00:30:13,645 --> 00:30:14,937
See, you should've
listened closely

614
00:30:14,938 --> 00:30:17,189
to those records that
I sent home with Cheo,

615
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:18,607
you'd understand it
would've been in the vinyl.

616
00:30:18,608 --> 00:30:20,859
Man, that music,
that music was wack.

617
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:22,486
There ain't nothin'
there for me.

618
00:30:22,487 --> 00:30:23,530
Yeah, whatever kid.

619
00:30:26,115 --> 00:30:27,157
Hey man?

620
00:30:27,158 --> 00:30:28,367
No hard feelings or what.

621
00:30:28,368 --> 00:30:29,327
Come on man, don't
worry about that.

622
00:30:29,328 --> 00:30:30,869
You know we're still homies.

623
00:30:30,870 --> 00:30:31,704
I got your back.

624
00:30:31,704 --> 00:30:32,539
Trying to roll out?

625
00:30:32,539 --> 00:30:33,373
Let's go.

626
00:30:33,374 --> 00:30:34,374
Let's go, man.

627
00:30:34,375 --> 00:30:35,541
All right Rol, see you later.

628
00:30:35,542 --> 00:30:36,709
All right, peace out kid.

629
00:30:42,966 --> 00:30:45,176
Hey man, let's go get Blue
and get something to eat.

630
00:30:46,719 --> 00:30:48,262
What?

631
00:30:48,263 --> 00:30:50,264
So what man, you
love her yet or what?

632
00:30:50,265 --> 00:30:51,515
You're trippin' bro.

633
00:30:51,516 --> 00:30:53,809
We're just close
friends, it's Blue.

634
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:55,478
Yeah man but
does she know that?

635
00:30:57,438 --> 00:30:59,106
You know what,
just call her over.

636
00:30:59,107 --> 00:31:00,482
I will.

637
00:31:00,483 --> 00:31:01,984
But hey, now that
I think about it,

638
00:31:01,985 --> 00:31:04,236
I've never met someone
as creative as her.

639
00:31:04,237 --> 00:31:06,780
Especially when it comes
to writing and music.

640
00:31:06,781 --> 00:31:08,907
Plus Blue is way
out of your league.

641
00:31:08,908 --> 00:31:10,784
Bro I could recruit
her for my team anyway.

642
00:31:10,785 --> 00:31:11,869
What you talkin' about you?

643
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:13,579
She wants a hero, not a zero.

644
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:15,080
So what are you
calling me a zero now?

645
00:31:15,081 --> 00:31:17,291
Dude, relax, I'm just
messing with you, man.

646
00:31:17,292 --> 00:31:19,376
But anyway, about
the graduation party,

647
00:31:19,377 --> 00:31:20,919
you coming over or what?

648
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:22,713
Yeah man, if
I'm still invited.

649
00:31:22,714 --> 00:31:24,423
You were never uninvited.

650
00:31:24,424 --> 00:31:26,217
Plus we got a couple
hours to kill.

651
00:31:27,385 --> 00:31:28,635
All right man, let's do this.

652
00:31:28,636 --> 00:31:29,596
Let's grab a quick bite to eat,

653
00:31:29,597 --> 00:31:30,846
we'll pick up Blue

654
00:31:30,847 --> 00:31:32,431
and then I'll drop you
off back at the crib.

655
00:31:32,432 --> 00:31:33,765
I've gotta go to the store
to hit up some things

656
00:31:33,766 --> 00:31:35,768
for the party, you know.

657
00:32:12,555 --> 00:32:15,682
Good job Cheo, I love you.

658
00:32:15,683 --> 00:32:17,100
Sup man.

659
00:32:17,101 --> 00:32:17,894
Sup E.

660
00:32:17,894 --> 00:32:18,728
Finally did it.

661
00:32:18,729 --> 00:32:20,145
We heading to the top.

662
00:32:20,146 --> 00:32:21,521
Bro this is the beginning
of our lives in music.

663
00:32:21,522 --> 00:32:23,357
Speaking of music,
check this keyboard

664
00:32:23,358 --> 00:32:24,776
I got from Jetty, it's sick.

665
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:34,660
Dude?

666
00:32:36,454 --> 00:32:39,247
Yo, can we just get this
party started or what?

667
00:32:39,248 --> 00:32:40,666
All right everybody,

668
00:32:40,667 --> 00:32:42,334
just wanted to thank
you all for making

669
00:32:42,335 --> 00:32:44,044
it out to my graduation.

670
00:32:44,045 --> 00:32:45,921
I see a couple of
graduates out there.

671
00:32:45,922 --> 00:32:46,881
Just wanna let you guys know

672
00:32:46,882 --> 00:32:48,715
that this is a new beginning,

673
00:32:48,716 --> 00:32:51,177
not just for me
but for all of us.

674
00:33:30,383 --> 00:33:33,885
Hey play some
of that Col-tran.

675
00:33:33,886 --> 00:33:35,471
Come over here, Chava.

676
00:33:46,899 --> 00:33:48,359
All right everybody,
settle down.

677
00:33:49,318 --> 00:33:51,111
I got one quick announcement,

678
00:33:51,112 --> 00:33:53,613
this, my boy Chava,
we grew up together

679
00:33:53,614 --> 00:33:55,575
and today is his graduation too.

680
00:33:57,618 --> 00:33:59,245
Get that big 'ol head over here.

681
00:34:02,665 --> 00:34:04,416
It's a degree in
body shop repairs

682
00:34:04,417 --> 00:34:07,919
and rehab of the tightest
low riders in Daly City,

683
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:09,713
I hereby declare you a graduate

684
00:34:09,714 --> 00:34:11,631
of the school of hard knocks

685
00:34:11,632 --> 00:34:13,216
with a degree in life studies,

686
00:34:13,217 --> 00:34:14,677
give it up to my boy Chava.

687
00:34:18,097 --> 00:34:20,266
Now let's really get
this party started.

688
00:35:13,903 --> 00:35:15,655
Here, listen to this.

689
00:35:27,208 --> 00:35:29,126
See this sound
is like so bomb,

690
00:35:29,127 --> 00:35:30,837
it needs to be on
the radio today.

691
00:35:31,712 --> 00:35:32,712
You know,

692
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:35,966
appreciate you're
my biggest fan.

693
00:35:35,967 --> 00:35:38,260
Well, my only fan.

694
00:35:38,261 --> 00:35:40,012
Your encouragement
really keeps me going.

695
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:43,933
Hey Cheo, come here.

696
00:35:46,185 --> 00:35:47,228
I'll be right back.

697
00:35:57,822 --> 00:36:01,867
Why are you listening
to this lame stuff?

698
00:36:01,868 --> 00:36:03,952
What are you doing later?

699
00:36:03,953 --> 00:36:06,122
Later, isn't it already late?

700
00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:08,875
Yeah but there's
always a later.

701
00:36:13,379 --> 00:36:15,213
So why they call you Sad Girl?

702
00:36:15,214 --> 00:36:16,883
Should call you
Bad Girl instead.

703
00:36:18,259 --> 00:36:21,846
But I ain't bad, I'm sad.

704
00:36:23,681 --> 00:36:25,099
Who says you can't be both?

705
00:36:27,226 --> 00:36:29,061
How'd you get so
sad all of a sudden?

706
00:36:30,229 --> 00:36:31,606
You were always
happy growing up.

707
00:36:32,773 --> 00:36:33,733
That was before
guys took advantage

708
00:36:33,734 --> 00:36:35,026
of me and broke my heart.

709
00:36:38,446 --> 00:36:39,572
Who broke your heart?

710
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:41,740
No matter.

711
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:46,161
Don't seem sad to me, Julie.

712
00:36:46,162 --> 00:36:48,914
I told you to stop
with that Julie stuff.

713
00:36:48,915 --> 00:36:51,209
Hey, let's go to the liquor
store and get some drinks.

714
00:36:53,419 --> 00:36:55,503
I got Blue and the boys here,

715
00:36:55,504 --> 00:36:56,756
just kick back and chill.

716
00:36:57,757 --> 00:36:59,258
Okay, show me your room then.

717
00:37:16,609 --> 00:37:17,776
Let me go check on everybody

718
00:37:17,777 --> 00:37:20,028
just make sure
everyone is cool, okay?

719
00:37:20,029 --> 00:37:21,988
Don't keep me
waiting too long.

720
00:37:21,989 --> 00:37:26,743
Chale.

721
00:37:26,744 --> 00:37:27,911
You okay?

722
00:37:27,912 --> 00:37:28,955
Yeah I'm fine.

723
00:37:29,872 --> 00:37:32,249
Yo E, can you take Blue home?

724
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:33,250
I live next door.

725
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:36,962
Eli, can you walk
her home or what?

726
00:37:36,963 --> 00:37:39,714
Yeah, man, anything
for you, right.

727
00:37:39,715 --> 00:37:40,800
Mr. Big shot.

728
00:37:44,011 --> 00:37:45,011
All right E.

729
00:37:49,225 --> 00:37:52,144
Bro, you good?

730
00:38:03,698 --> 00:38:04,824
It's about time.

731
00:38:07,868 --> 00:38:09,661
What are you waiting for?

732
00:38:09,662 --> 00:38:10,830
Get over here.

733
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:32,643
Hey, I got you
those frozen burritos.

734
00:38:38,816 --> 00:38:39,816
Che?

735
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:46,197
Hey, you don't
answer your phone?

736
00:38:46,198 --> 00:38:47,866
I got you those frozen burritos.

737
00:38:47,867 --> 00:38:49,243
Yeah, thanks Blue.

738
00:38:53,539 --> 00:38:55,875
It smells flowery in here.

739
00:39:34,955 --> 00:39:36,206
Are you hungry yet?

740
00:39:36,207 --> 00:39:38,583
You've gotten three
full compositions out.

741
00:39:38,584 --> 00:39:39,876
Yeah, sorry,
let me just finish

742
00:39:39,877 --> 00:39:41,086
this last hook on here,

743
00:39:41,087 --> 00:39:44,589
and then we'll go
get something to eat.

744
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:46,424
How's patron sound to you?

745
00:39:46,425 --> 00:39:47,801
Sounds good.

746
00:39:47,802 --> 00:39:48,802
Sweet.

747
00:39:58,771 --> 00:40:02,357
This next performer,
I've known for many years,

748
00:40:02,358 --> 00:40:04,609
I've seen and heard
his growth in music,

749
00:40:04,610 --> 00:40:06,403
he has mastered the integration

750
00:40:06,404 --> 00:40:09,781
of today's popular hip hop
sound with the past generation

751
00:40:09,782 --> 00:40:12,158
in ways I've never heard before.

752
00:40:12,159 --> 00:40:14,911
But first, he has
written and composed

753
00:40:14,912 --> 00:40:17,497
a brand new song that
he's gonna preform

754
00:40:17,498 --> 00:40:18,665
for you guys tonight.

755
00:40:18,666 --> 00:40:22,293
With his lead
singer, Julie Torres

756
00:40:22,294 --> 00:40:24,003
and I want you to give it up big

757
00:40:24,004 --> 00:40:26,632
for my man, Cheo Colorado!

758
00:40:44,275 --> 00:40:48,486

him much credit ♪

759
00:40:48,487 --> 00:40:53,451

♪ And they call him the devil

768
00:41:21,854 --> 00:41:23,104
Michael, I'm glad
you were able to make

769
00:41:23,105 --> 00:41:24,105
it out today.

770
00:41:25,399 --> 00:41:27,692
This is the young guy I've
been talking to you about.

771
00:41:27,693 --> 00:41:30,028
I think he has the sound
that you've been looking

772
00:41:30,029 --> 00:41:31,405
for on your roster.

773
00:41:32,698 --> 00:41:34,324
I like it.

774
00:41:34,325 --> 00:41:36,034
How did you find the kid?

775
00:41:36,035 --> 00:41:37,953
I have never heard
anything like that.

776
00:41:38,913 --> 00:41:40,580
Ah, he's a boy from my hood.

777
00:41:40,581 --> 00:41:42,415
He's always had an ear for music

778
00:41:42,416 --> 00:41:44,250
and he's been teaching
himself arranging

779
00:41:44,251 --> 00:41:45,251
and composing.

780
00:41:46,504 --> 00:41:49,048
Introduce me to him
when he finishes his set.

781
00:41:50,257 --> 00:41:53,427
I think I may have found
what I am looking for.

782
00:41:59,308 --> 00:42:02,603
Give it up for him,
give it up for him.

783
00:42:06,815 --> 00:42:08,149
All right, I hope you
guys enjoyed yourself

784
00:42:08,150 --> 00:42:10,401
at Roland Record Summer Series,

785
00:42:10,402 --> 00:42:13,404
my showcase of new and
up and coming artists.

786
00:42:13,405 --> 00:42:14,572
It's been a wonderful
day of music,

787
00:42:14,573 --> 00:42:15,658
wouldn't you agree?

788
00:42:17,076 --> 00:42:20,913
Let's make some noise for
this lead singer, let's go.

789
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:35,593
♪ You, you think I'm
gonna fall so easily. ♪

790
00:42:35,594 --> 00:42:37,095

00:42:37,096 --> 00:42:39,847
Hi, may I have the
pleasure of introducing you

792
00:42:39,848 --> 00:42:43,434
to the sound of
tomorrow, this is Cheo,

793
00:42:43,435 --> 00:42:45,019
Cheo this is Michael Deville,

794
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:47,355
owner of Deville records.

795
00:42:47,356 --> 00:42:50,276
Son, you had a very
impressive set here today.

796
00:42:51,777 --> 00:42:53,528
Let me get right to the point.

797
00:42:53,529 --> 00:42:55,613
I want to sign you up.

798
00:42:55,614 --> 00:42:57,615
I think I can use you.

799
00:42:57,616 --> 00:43:01,244
And also I'd like to record
your last composition

800
00:43:01,245 --> 00:43:02,245
on vinyl.

801
00:43:03,289 --> 00:43:04,664
Why thank you so
much Mr. Deville,

802
00:43:04,665 --> 00:43:06,165
it's an honor to meet you.

803
00:43:06,166 --> 00:43:07,875
I really think that this music

804
00:43:07,876 --> 00:43:10,045
is gonna be the new
way for our generation.

805
00:43:11,297 --> 00:43:13,715
Roland was quite
right about you.

806
00:43:13,716 --> 00:43:16,802
You have got ear for
music and arranging.

807
00:43:17,678 --> 00:43:19,680
Do you have any representation?

808
00:43:21,098 --> 00:43:23,391
Do you have a manager, agent?

809
00:43:23,392 --> 00:43:26,978
Um, I kind of just
represent myself.

810
00:43:26,979 --> 00:43:30,065
Roland, he's like
my manager, I guess.

811
00:43:33,986 --> 00:43:34,986
Here's my card.

812
00:43:38,157 --> 00:43:40,450
Give me a call sometime soon,

813
00:43:40,451 --> 00:43:42,827
so that we can
schedule something.

814
00:43:42,828 --> 00:43:44,622
I want to do
everything official.

815
00:43:45,706 --> 00:43:47,958
You bet, Mr. Deville,
thank you so much.

816
00:43:49,752 --> 00:43:51,337
It was nice meeting you, Cheo.

817
00:43:52,296 --> 00:43:53,504
Roland, take care.

818
00:43:53,505 --> 00:43:55,007
All right, we'll be in touch.

819
00:43:59,136 --> 00:44:00,970
Thank you so much,
Roland, thank you.

820
00:44:00,971 --> 00:44:02,513
For everything
you've done for me.

821
00:44:02,514 --> 00:44:03,973
I told you.

822
00:44:03,974 --> 00:44:06,017
I didn't think everything
was gonna come so quick.

823
00:44:06,018 --> 00:44:09,187
Kid, I told you, you
did all the hard work.

824
00:44:09,188 --> 00:44:11,022
All I did was identify talent.

825
00:44:11,023 --> 00:44:12,690
People love working
with true talent.

826
00:44:12,691 --> 00:44:15,860
So, enjoy the rest of your day

827
00:44:15,861 --> 00:44:17,528
and get in contact
with me in the morning.

828
00:44:17,529 --> 00:44:18,738
All right?

829
00:44:18,739 --> 00:44:20,866
Will do, thank
you so much, man.

830
00:44:28,165 --> 00:44:30,249
So you wanna come out or?

831
00:44:30,250 --> 00:44:31,584
Come out where?

832
00:44:31,585 --> 00:44:33,878
We could go and
grab something to eat.

833
00:44:33,879 --> 00:44:35,254
Yeah, when Cheo
comes out, we can go.

834
00:44:35,255 --> 00:44:37,048
No, just me and you.

835
00:44:37,049 --> 00:44:38,257
What, Eli?

836
00:44:38,258 --> 00:44:40,677
Just me and you hang
out somewhere, you know?

837
00:44:40,678 --> 00:44:41,803
You don't want Cheo to come.

838
00:44:41,804 --> 00:44:42,887
Nah, just us, you know.

839
00:44:42,888 --> 00:44:44,390
Yo E, can you pop the trunk?

840
00:44:53,899 --> 00:44:56,317
Is it hella cool in there?

841
00:44:56,318 --> 00:44:58,111
- Yeah.
- You sure?

842
00:44:58,112 --> 00:45:01,572
Hey Eli, can you give Sad
Girl a ride up the block?

843
00:45:01,573 --> 00:45:02,408
Yeah, man.

844
00:45:02,408 --> 00:45:03,408
Sweet.

845
00:45:05,619 --> 00:45:07,912
Hey Blue, can you move over
and make some room, please?

846
00:45:07,913 --> 00:45:09,373
Yeah, whatever.

847
00:45:14,002 --> 00:45:16,045
Did you ever get
this door fixed?

848
00:45:16,046 --> 00:45:17,464
Man I'm broke, just get in.

849
00:46:12,728 --> 00:46:14,313
Hey, thanks for the ride, bro.

850
00:46:15,189 --> 00:46:16,647
I think today went really well.

851
00:46:16,648 --> 00:46:17,815
Yeah man, I'm surprised

852
00:46:17,816 --> 00:46:19,025
they actually liked
your old sound.

853
00:46:19,026 --> 00:46:21,068
Even that old man
from the record label.

854
00:46:21,069 --> 00:46:22,987
All right man,
let's get the trunk.

855
00:46:22,988 --> 00:46:23,822
Hey I thought we were
gonna have a bite and

856
00:46:23,823 --> 00:46:25,072
talk about the concert.

857
00:46:25,073 --> 00:46:26,115
Uh let's take a rain
check on that Blue,

858
00:46:26,116 --> 00:46:27,993
we'll talk about it tomorrow.

859
00:46:30,496 --> 00:46:31,496
Sweet.

860
00:46:38,170 --> 00:46:40,171
Hey Julie, why
don't you sleep with

861
00:46:40,172 --> 00:46:41,172
the guys on your own block, huh,

862
00:46:41,173 --> 00:46:43,007
Cheo's way out of your league.

863
00:46:43,008 --> 00:46:45,134
Whatever scrappa,
I could get any guy

864
00:46:45,135 --> 00:46:47,762
in this neighborhood
or any neighborhood.

865
00:46:47,763 --> 00:46:49,263
You're just jealous.

866
00:46:49,264 --> 00:46:51,015
Cheo's nothing like the
guy's in your neighborhood.

867
00:46:51,016 --> 00:46:52,058
He's actually gonna
get out of here

868
00:46:52,059 --> 00:46:53,392
and make something of himself.

869
00:46:53,393 --> 00:46:55,603
You're just some
trashy distraction.

870
00:46:55,604 --> 00:46:57,522
Why don't you let Cheo
decide what he wants?

871
00:46:57,523 --> 00:46:59,106
'Cause last night it
seemed like he wanted me.

872
00:46:59,107 --> 00:47:02,026
I don't see him inviting
you into his bed.

873
00:47:02,027 --> 00:47:04,111
You don't even know him.

874
00:47:04,112 --> 00:47:05,321
I know him enough to know

875
00:47:05,322 --> 00:47:06,864
he looks good with
his shirt off.

876
00:47:06,865 --> 00:47:09,034
That's more than you
know, isn't it, ninita?

877
00:47:13,205 --> 00:47:15,207
I'll see you tomorrow,
Blue, let's go.

878
00:47:22,923 --> 00:47:23,882
Hood rats these days.

879
00:47:23,883 --> 00:47:26,050
Compositions, compositions.

880
00:47:26,051 --> 00:47:27,969
This is starting
to feel like a job,

881
00:47:27,970 --> 00:47:31,055
this isn't fun anymore,
not with all the pressure.

882
00:47:31,056 --> 00:47:33,391
How are you doing,
mi sentimental?

883
00:47:33,392 --> 00:47:34,892
Isn't obvious?

884
00:47:34,893 --> 00:47:36,394
I feel horrible.

885
00:47:36,395 --> 00:47:39,188
My music sucks, Michael
Deville called last week,

886
00:47:39,189 --> 00:47:41,190
talking about he wants
to meet in five days

887
00:47:41,191 --> 00:47:42,401
to hear some new tracks.

888
00:47:45,571 --> 00:47:48,031
Don't say that,
you're just stuck.

889
00:47:49,199 --> 00:47:51,367
What do they call
it in the music biz?

890
00:47:51,368 --> 00:47:52,577
Writer's block.

891
00:47:52,578 --> 00:47:55,080
But it feels like it's
much more than that.

892
00:47:58,125 --> 00:47:59,918
Here, I'll help you relax.

893
00:48:02,796 --> 00:48:05,298
Am I gonna be all right?

894
00:48:05,299 --> 00:48:07,341
Baby, you know I
wouldn't be wasting

895
00:48:07,342 --> 00:48:08,593
my time with you
unless I thought

896
00:48:08,594 --> 00:48:10,345
you were gonna be
something, right?

897
00:48:27,571 --> 00:48:29,238
So what's up, did you do it?

898
00:48:29,239 --> 00:48:30,656
Yeah, he's all messed
up thanks to you.

899
00:48:30,657 --> 00:48:32,158
And you.

900
00:48:32,159 --> 00:48:33,118
Don't pretend you have nothing
to do with this, all right?

901
00:48:33,119 --> 00:48:34,577
Is he in there writing, though?

902
00:48:34,578 --> 00:48:35,745
He's wired, he could barely
string together a thought.

903
00:48:35,746 --> 00:48:37,246
You got my money?

904
00:48:37,247 --> 00:48:38,789
I'm a little short right now,

905
00:48:38,790 --> 00:48:39,957
I went down to Roland's and I
spent more than I should have.

906
00:48:39,958 --> 00:48:41,375
That's not gonna
work for me, homeboy.

907
00:48:41,376 --> 00:48:42,376
How about I go tell Cheo where

908
00:48:42,377 --> 00:48:43,586
I really get the
good stuff from?

909
00:48:43,587 --> 00:48:45,129
Nah, come here,
come here, come here.

910
00:48:45,130 --> 00:48:46,130
You know, here, just
take it, it's all I got.

911
00:48:46,131 --> 00:48:47,632
Just take it.

912
00:48:47,633 --> 00:48:48,717
That's more like it.

913
00:48:52,179 --> 00:48:53,596
So what's up, you
free tomorrow night?

914
00:48:53,597 --> 00:48:54,973
Yeah, have fun.

915
00:49:00,812 --> 00:49:02,313
Hey what's up man?

916
00:49:02,314 --> 00:49:03,649
How you doin'?

917
00:49:05,359 --> 00:49:06,526
You doin' good or what?

918
00:49:07,527 --> 00:49:08,819
Pretty good right about now.

919
00:49:08,820 --> 00:49:11,155
Are you ready for
your meeting or what?

920
00:49:11,156 --> 00:49:12,907
Come on, let's hear it.

921
00:49:12,908 --> 00:49:13,825
Come on.

922
00:49:13,826 --> 00:49:15,743
No, no, come on, come on.

923
00:49:15,744 --> 00:49:16,578
Come here.

924
00:49:16,578 --> 00:49:17,412
Hey Eli.

925
00:49:17,413 --> 00:49:18,621
Hey, what's up?

926
00:49:18,622 --> 00:49:20,873
Hey just sit down,
listen to some music.

927
00:49:20,874 --> 00:49:22,458
Fix it.

928
00:49:22,459 --> 00:49:23,918
What's going on?

929
00:49:23,919 --> 00:49:26,420
Nothing, he's just about
to get ready for his meeting.

930
00:49:26,421 --> 00:49:27,421
No, Cheo?

931
00:49:29,424 --> 00:49:30,675
Cheo, what's going on?

932
00:49:30,676 --> 00:49:32,510
Nah, it sounds good
man, keep it coming.

933
00:49:32,511 --> 00:49:33,345
It doesn't.

934
00:49:33,346 --> 00:49:34,346
It sounds good.

935
00:49:35,514 --> 00:49:37,056
Are you hearing the
same thing I'm hearing?

936
00:49:37,057 --> 00:49:38,349
This doesn't sound good.

937
00:49:38,350 --> 00:49:40,518
Cheo, your hooks are
completely off beat,

938
00:49:40,519 --> 00:49:42,520
your arrangements don't
even mix together.

939
00:49:42,521 --> 00:49:44,105
Where are your
full compensations?

940
00:49:44,106 --> 00:49:45,356
Just keep on playing man.

941
00:49:45,357 --> 00:49:47,149
You trippin', you
always be trippin'!

942
00:49:47,150 --> 00:49:48,317
I'm trippin'?

943
00:49:48,318 --> 00:49:50,236
Dude, he doesn't
even like your music,

944
00:49:50,237 --> 00:49:51,196
do you hear him?

945
00:49:51,197 --> 00:49:52,446
It sounds good,

946
00:49:52,447 --> 00:49:54,449
he's getting ready
for this meeting.

947
00:49:56,326 --> 00:49:57,827
You got something to say, what?

948
00:49:57,828 --> 00:50:00,246
I just saw you on the
street kissing Sad Girl

949
00:50:00,247 --> 00:50:01,081
and now you're in here,

950
00:50:01,082 --> 00:50:02,498
what are you up to?

951
00:50:02,499 --> 00:50:03,417
You're over here accusing
that he's on drugs,

952
00:50:03,418 --> 00:50:04,750
maybe you're the one on drugs.

953
00:50:04,751 --> 00:50:06,002
Saying that I'm with Sad Girl,

954
00:50:06,003 --> 00:50:06,795
I'm never with Sad
Girl, all right.

955
00:50:06,795 --> 00:50:07,587
I just saw you!

956
00:50:07,587 --> 00:50:08,547
That wasn't me.

957
00:50:08,548 --> 00:50:10,047
Oh really, that's weird

958
00:50:10,048 --> 00:50:12,049
because that person was
wearing your same outfit.

959
00:50:12,050 --> 00:50:13,509
You're tripping, like I said.

960
00:50:13,510 --> 00:50:15,928
Cheo, what is going on?

961
00:50:15,929 --> 00:50:17,806
Okay, are you okay?

962
00:50:20,726 --> 00:50:21,976
I think you need to leave.

963
00:50:21,977 --> 00:50:23,227
What did you do to him?

964
00:50:23,228 --> 00:50:24,895
Just go, you should
just go already, man.

965
00:50:24,896 --> 00:50:25,896
No!

966
00:50:25,897 --> 00:50:27,023
Just go.

967
00:50:27,024 --> 00:50:28,232
You go.

968
00:50:28,233 --> 00:50:29,900
Hey Cheo, just keep
playing that stuff.

969
00:50:29,901 --> 00:50:31,110
Keep doing it man.

970
00:50:31,111 --> 00:50:34,238
Cheo, you just need to
rest and stop playing.

971
00:50:34,239 --> 00:50:36,240
Just get out.

972
00:50:36,241 --> 00:50:38,659
Just get out.

973
00:50:38,660 --> 00:50:39,494
Why should I?

974
00:50:39,494 --> 00:50:40,494
Get out!

975
00:50:42,831 --> 00:50:44,081
You obviously don't
want to protect him

976
00:50:44,082 --> 00:50:45,708
and I actually care
about him, Eli.

977
00:50:45,709 --> 00:50:47,752
Did you not listen
to what he just said?

978
00:50:47,753 --> 00:50:48,753
I don't care
what he just said,

979
00:50:48,754 --> 00:50:49,920
he's obviously on something.

980
00:50:49,921 --> 00:50:50,756
He said get out!

981
00:50:50,756 --> 00:50:51,756
Just get out already!

982
00:50:53,216 --> 00:50:54,633
Leave!

983
00:50:54,634 --> 00:50:56,427
Nah man, just sit down, dude.

984
00:50:56,428 --> 00:50:58,763
You're doing good man,
you're doing good.

985
00:50:58,764 --> 00:51:01,682
Hey man, you need
some of this or what?

986
00:51:01,683 --> 00:51:02,851
Hey, you good?

987
00:52:01,618 --> 00:52:04,537
Hello, Cheo, how
are you doing today?

988
00:52:04,538 --> 00:52:06,330
Doing quite well, Mr. Deville,

989
00:52:06,331 --> 00:52:07,541
thank you for having me.

990
00:52:10,293 --> 00:52:11,669
So I wanted to let you know,

991
00:52:11,670 --> 00:52:13,588
I received your
file this morning.

992
00:52:16,258 --> 00:52:17,843
I listened to it and

993
00:52:19,010 --> 00:52:21,178
let me just cut to the chase,

994
00:52:21,179 --> 00:52:22,305
I'm not impressed.

995
00:52:24,057 --> 00:52:26,016
I didn't send you
anything by mail.

996
00:52:26,017 --> 00:52:28,478
I have my own stuff here, look.

997
00:52:29,688 --> 00:52:31,021
Well I received something,

998
00:52:31,022 --> 00:52:32,773
it had your name on it.

999
00:52:32,774 --> 00:52:36,318
But regardless, I'm not sure if

1000
00:52:36,319 --> 00:52:37,987
this is the right
timing of things,

1001
00:52:37,988 --> 00:52:40,156
if you understand what I mean.

1002
00:52:40,157 --> 00:52:41,867
No, I don't understand.

1003
00:52:43,577 --> 00:52:47,705
Well, Cheo, I might
have jumped the gun

1004
00:52:47,706 --> 00:52:49,874
a little bit too soon with you.

1005
00:52:49,875 --> 00:52:52,501
To be honest, I
don't even remember

1006
00:52:52,502 --> 00:52:54,378
what I listened to last month's

1007
00:52:54,379 --> 00:52:55,714
Back at the Summer Series.

1008
00:52:57,591 --> 00:53:00,176
Please, Mr. Deville, I've
been working really hard

1009
00:53:00,177 --> 00:53:02,219
and I'm ready to take
you up on my offer.

1010
00:53:02,220 --> 00:53:03,971
I'm not sure what you
received this morning

1011
00:53:03,972 --> 00:53:06,015
in the mail but I
promise I have something

1012
00:53:06,016 --> 00:53:07,474
you'll be interested in.

1013
00:53:07,475 --> 00:53:10,394
Please, if you would,
just listen to this track

1014
00:53:10,395 --> 00:53:12,189
and see if you
like what you hear.

1015
00:53:22,699 --> 00:53:23,699
Any minute now.

1016
00:53:49,559 --> 00:53:51,185
I'm sorry, Cheo.

1017
00:53:51,186 --> 00:53:53,103
The deal has been revoked.

1018
00:53:53,104 --> 00:53:55,232
We are moving forward
with a new artist.

1019
00:54:45,323 --> 00:54:46,532
Welcome, Eli.

1020
00:54:46,533 --> 00:54:48,033
Hi.

1021
00:54:48,034 --> 00:54:48,868
Nice to meet you.

1022
00:54:48,868 --> 00:54:49,868
Please have a seat.

1023
00:54:51,663 --> 00:54:53,330
We listened to your
tape and it's exactly

1024
00:54:53,331 --> 00:54:55,040
what the boss wanted to hear

1025
00:54:55,041 --> 00:54:57,251
and the direction this
label wants to be in.

1026
00:54:57,252 --> 00:54:59,545
So Mr. Eli Cole, we're hopeful

1027
00:54:59,546 --> 00:55:01,297
and thought if you could
start off by selling

1028
00:55:01,298 --> 00:55:03,465
a million units,
you'd be on track

1029
00:55:03,466 --> 00:55:05,718
to lock in a two album deal.

1030
00:55:05,719 --> 00:55:07,177
A million units
includes domestic

1031
00:55:07,178 --> 00:55:08,345
and foreign sales.

1032
00:55:08,346 --> 00:55:09,596
Just so we're clear.

1033
00:55:09,597 --> 00:55:10,764
Yeah, we're clear but

1034
00:55:10,765 --> 00:55:12,475
what do I receive up front?

1035
00:55:13,935 --> 00:55:15,644
It's not as black and white

1036
00:55:15,645 --> 00:55:16,855
as it normally would be.

1037
00:55:17,814 --> 00:55:19,189
Your sound has potential.

1038
00:55:19,190 --> 00:55:20,816
You had a great response
from our focus group

1039
00:55:20,817 --> 00:55:23,360
and our firm would like to
build around your sound.

1040
00:55:23,361 --> 00:55:26,822
So we're cutting you a
check for 250,000 dollars

1041
00:55:26,823 --> 00:55:30,535
with the deal that you product
one album to start with.

1042
00:55:31,703 --> 00:55:33,245
All studio expenses
and engineering time

1043
00:55:33,246 --> 00:55:35,122
will be covered, of course.

1044
00:55:35,123 --> 00:55:37,541
And any remaining profits
from potential units sold

1045
00:55:37,542 --> 00:55:39,752
will be added to that 250k.

1046
00:55:39,753 --> 00:55:42,379
But just think of this as sort
of an upfront signing bonus,

1047
00:55:42,380 --> 00:55:43,714
if you will.

1048
00:55:43,715 --> 00:55:45,884
Mr. Cole, Michael
loved your sound.

1049
00:55:47,177 --> 00:55:49,636
And he wants to move
forward with you.

1050
00:55:49,637 --> 00:55:51,555
We here at Deville Records know

1051
00:55:51,556 --> 00:55:53,807
that you have what it
takes to be the best.

1052
00:55:53,808 --> 00:55:54,851
Which is why,

1053
00:55:57,896 --> 00:55:59,564
we'd like you to
sign a contract.

1054
00:56:01,733 --> 00:56:03,150
What do you say Eli?

1055
00:56:03,151 --> 00:56:04,151
Do we have a deal?

1056
00:56:05,612 --> 00:56:06,862
An opportunity like

1057
00:56:06,863 --> 00:56:08,781
this only comes around
once in a lifetime.

1058
00:56:08,782 --> 00:56:09,782
I'm in.

1059
00:56:10,784 --> 00:56:12,451
Awesome, Eli.

1060
00:56:12,452 --> 00:56:13,328
Welcome to the team.

1061
00:56:13,328 --> 00:56:14,328
Thank you.

1062
00:56:54,786 --> 00:56:56,829
Your family has been
looking for you for months,

1063
00:56:56,830 --> 00:57:00,999
I had no way of knowing
what happened to you.

1064
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,002
Are you listening to me?

1065
00:57:06,131 --> 00:57:08,633
I once knew a girl name Blue

1066
00:57:10,135 --> 00:57:11,468
but you seem nice.

1067
00:57:11,469 --> 00:57:12,845
Let me take you out of here

1068
00:57:12,846 --> 00:57:14,888
and get you clean.

1069
00:57:14,889 --> 00:57:16,808
I can take care of you.

1070
00:57:17,976 --> 00:57:19,601
You have anything on you,

1071
00:57:19,602 --> 00:57:20,936
I could use a bump
right about now.

1072
00:57:20,937 --> 00:57:23,439
No, just let me
take you home now.

1073
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:24,857
I don't have a home.

1074
00:57:24,858 --> 00:57:25,858
I lost it.

1075
00:57:27,652 --> 00:57:29,069
I'm not Cheo.

1076
00:57:29,070 --> 00:57:30,988
I can't watch
you die like this.

1077
00:57:30,989 --> 00:57:31,989
I love you.

1078
00:57:38,538 --> 00:57:39,538
Really?

1079
00:57:40,373 --> 00:57:41,373
Yeah.

1080
00:57:42,876 --> 00:57:44,169
Crystal Blue.

1081
00:57:47,755 --> 00:57:49,840
Can I tell you something?

1082
00:57:49,841 --> 00:57:51,176
Yes, anything.

1083
00:57:54,512 --> 00:57:57,432
Go on and get
yourself a real man.

1084
00:57:58,641 --> 00:58:01,728
Forget about me, you
don't deserve this.

1085
00:58:04,772 --> 00:58:05,772
No.

1086
00:58:53,655 --> 00:58:56,990
I can't watch you die
like this, I love you.

1087
00:58:56,991 --> 00:58:59,660
Cheo, the Lord
says there's a friend

1088
00:58:59,661 --> 00:59:01,036
who sticks closer
than a brother.

1089
00:59:01,037 --> 00:59:03,038
Foolishness to those
who are perishing,

1090
00:59:03,039 --> 00:59:04,414
but to us who are being saved,

1091
00:59:04,415 --> 00:59:05,750
it is the power of God.

1092
00:59:08,253 --> 00:59:09,921
Lord, if you're real, help me.

1093
00:59:37,448 --> 00:59:40,660
Son, son, do you need help?

1094
00:59:41,953 --> 00:59:43,328
We don't want anything from you,

1095
00:59:43,329 --> 00:59:44,455
we just wanna help.

1096
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:50,961
Men, please help this young man.

1097
00:59:50,962 --> 00:59:51,963
Yes, we can.

1098
00:59:59,971 --> 01:00:01,179
Take him to the intake room

1099
01:00:01,180 --> 01:00:04,767
and get some clean
clothes and dinner.

1100
01:00:06,019 --> 01:00:08,103
Yes, let's get you
cleaned up, brother.

1101
01:00:08,104 --> 01:00:13,109
Warm food in your belly, get
you a clean bed to sleep in.

1102
01:00:13,693 --> 01:00:14,736
All right.

1103
01:00:35,757 --> 01:00:37,342
There's some
food here for you.

1104
01:01:44,742 --> 01:01:46,703
Lord we thank
you for this meal,

1105
01:01:47,787 --> 01:01:50,455
and for the nourishment
of our body.

1106
01:01:50,456 --> 01:01:52,416
And Father, we pray Lord,

1107
01:01:52,417 --> 01:01:55,878
for those Lord, that
are still in wilderness.

1108
01:01:57,088 --> 01:02:00,924
And are lost, that are homeless

1109
01:02:00,925 --> 01:02:03,093
and most of all, Father,

1110
01:02:03,094 --> 01:02:04,095
that are hungry.

1111
01:02:05,346 --> 01:02:07,889
Lord, we know you're
a merciful God,

1112
01:02:07,890 --> 01:02:09,099
and we thank you Lord,

1113
01:02:09,100 --> 01:02:11,393
in the name of Jesus, amen.

1114
01:02:11,394 --> 01:02:12,394
Amen.

1115
01:02:15,273 --> 01:02:18,860
Hey bro, I'm
glad you feel safe.

1116
01:02:20,778 --> 01:02:22,780
I heard them bringing
you in last night.

1117
01:02:23,906 --> 01:02:26,950
So, do you guys do
this every time you eat?

1118
01:02:26,951 --> 01:02:28,493
Well yeah, you know,

1119
01:02:28,494 --> 01:02:29,745
a little prayer, you know,

1120
01:02:29,746 --> 01:02:32,247
it keep us thankful.

1121
01:02:32,248 --> 01:02:33,624
By the way, where you from?

1122
01:02:35,293 --> 01:02:38,378
I used to live in Daly
City, up on the hill,

1123
01:02:38,379 --> 01:02:40,881
near the East Side.

1124
01:02:40,882 --> 01:02:42,257
East Side?

1125
01:02:42,258 --> 01:02:44,301
You know what,
you look familiar.

1126
01:02:44,302 --> 01:02:47,596
Do you have a
brother named Jetty?

1127
01:02:47,597 --> 01:02:48,972
Yeah, that's my older brother.

1128
01:02:48,973 --> 01:02:50,474
- Oh!
- He's out of the country.

1129
01:02:50,475 --> 01:02:51,892
He's actually in
the marine corp.

1130
01:02:51,893 --> 01:02:54,352
You know what, I was
there when he enlisted.

1131
01:02:54,353 --> 01:02:55,313
Really?

1132
01:02:55,314 --> 01:02:56,354
Yeah man, you know what?

1133
01:02:57,982 --> 01:02:59,776
He had way more guts than me.

1134
01:03:01,319 --> 01:03:04,821
So where am I?

1135
01:03:04,822 --> 01:03:06,364
What is this place?

1136
01:03:06,365 --> 01:03:07,657
You're at the New Hope Home

1137
01:03:07,658 --> 01:03:10,118
and Pastor Donna brought
you in last night.

1138
01:03:10,119 --> 01:03:13,205
It's by Christ that she
found you when she did.

1139
01:03:13,206 --> 01:03:16,166
Where is this
Jesus, can I meet him?

1140
01:03:16,167 --> 01:03:17,835
We're about to
have Bible study.

1141
01:03:19,337 --> 01:03:23,424
Today can be the first day
of the rest of your life.

1142
01:03:25,885 --> 01:03:27,427
Is Jesus gonna be there?

1143
01:03:27,428 --> 01:03:29,347
And what's a Bible study?

1144
01:03:30,223 --> 01:03:32,850
Well, he's already there.

1145
01:03:33,810 --> 01:03:35,227
And he's waiting for you.

1146
01:03:35,228 --> 01:03:37,522
And he's directly
down that hall.

1147
01:03:39,565 --> 01:03:43,527
Hello, Cheo, so glad
you could join us today.

1148
01:03:43,528 --> 01:03:45,111
Thank you Pastor
Jesus for allowing

1149
01:03:45,112 --> 01:03:47,155
me to stay here last night.

1150
01:03:47,156 --> 01:03:49,200
You called Pastor Donna Jesus.

1151
01:03:53,538 --> 01:03:55,288
I'm Pastor Donna.

1152
01:03:55,289 --> 01:03:56,998
Today we'll be
learning about Jesus

1153
01:03:56,999 --> 01:03:58,543
and how much he loves us.

1154
01:04:00,253 --> 01:04:02,171
No one would love
a failure like me.

1155
01:04:04,966 --> 01:04:06,551
People look at the outside

1156
01:04:07,552 --> 01:04:10,512
but Jesus looks at your heart.

1157
01:04:10,513 --> 01:04:12,055
Can I meet him?

1158
01:04:12,056 --> 01:04:13,557
You already have.

1159
01:04:13,558 --> 01:04:14,559
He brought you here.

1160
01:04:18,187 --> 01:04:22,649
Men, I trust you've all
met our new brother, Cheo.

1161
01:04:22,650 --> 01:04:24,485
Cheo will be staying
here for awhile.

1162
01:04:25,736 --> 01:04:27,296
- Great to meet you all.
- How you doin?

1163
01:04:28,739 --> 01:04:29,739
Welcome.

1164
01:04:31,242 --> 01:04:32,242
Hey there brother.

1165
01:04:35,079 --> 01:04:36,247
Great to meet you all.

1166
01:04:38,374 --> 01:04:39,876
This is a safe place, Cheo.

1167
01:04:41,085 --> 01:04:44,005
We've all made decisions
we regret, including me.

1168
01:04:45,923 --> 01:04:48,426
But our future doesn't
have to look like our past.

1169
01:04:50,344 --> 01:04:51,595
I know it's a lot to take in

1170
01:04:51,596 --> 01:04:54,306
but essentially we
have two choices.

1171
01:04:54,307 --> 01:04:56,601
We can keep doing things
the way we always have

1172
01:04:58,102 --> 01:05:00,604
or we can begin
to fill our hearts

1173
01:05:00,605 --> 01:05:03,733
with the immeasurable
love of Jesus.

1174
01:05:04,734 --> 01:05:05,734
Fill my heart?

1175
01:05:07,111 --> 01:05:10,114
Yes, Cheo, the
choice is yours.

1176
01:06:55,803 --> 01:06:58,054
Hi, Pastor Donna,
do you have a moment?

1177
01:06:58,055 --> 01:06:59,055
Sure, c'mon.

1178
01:07:03,602 --> 01:07:06,563
So I've been doing a lot
of thinking this past year.

1179
01:07:06,564 --> 01:07:08,064
I've come to realize
that I've taken

1180
01:07:08,065 --> 01:07:10,567
a lot of things in
life for granted.

1181
01:07:10,568 --> 01:07:12,235
I'm praying over a situation

1182
01:07:12,236 --> 01:07:14,112
and I was hoping you
could impart some wisdom,

1183
01:07:14,113 --> 01:07:15,822
on something important.

1184
01:07:15,823 --> 01:07:17,783
Of course, Cheo,
what's on your mind?

1185
01:07:19,744 --> 01:07:21,202
It's Blue.

1186
01:07:21,203 --> 01:07:23,413
I've taken her love for
granted since we were kids.

1187
01:07:23,414 --> 01:07:25,623
And she's always
been there for me.

1188
01:07:25,624 --> 01:07:26,875
I made right with the Lord

1189
01:07:26,876 --> 01:07:28,043
and I now I wanna
make right with her

1190
01:07:28,044 --> 01:07:29,253
and ask her to marry me.

1191
01:07:30,212 --> 01:07:32,715
Cheo I'm so happy for you.

1192
01:07:33,716 --> 01:07:36,176
I've seen how Blue looks at you.

1193
01:07:36,177 --> 01:07:38,887
You'll be the missing
puzzle piece to her heart.

1194
01:07:38,888 --> 01:07:40,722
You really think so?

1195
01:07:40,723 --> 01:07:43,349
Is there something
in particular I can do?

1196
01:07:43,350 --> 01:07:45,393
Yes, I was hoping
you could help me find

1197
01:07:45,394 --> 01:07:47,479
the perfect engagement
ring for her.

1198
01:07:47,480 --> 01:07:48,939
I would love to help you.

1199
01:07:49,940 --> 01:07:51,357
I'll tell you what, how about

1200
01:07:51,358 --> 01:07:53,902
we go first thing tomorrow
morning, will that work for you?

1201
01:07:53,903 --> 01:07:55,487
That's perfect.

1202
01:07:55,488 --> 01:07:58,114
Wait, are you sure
that's not too early?

1203
01:07:58,115 --> 01:08:00,075
It's not every day
I get to help someone

1204
01:08:00,076 --> 01:08:01,701
from our group get married.

1205
01:08:01,702 --> 01:08:03,745
Thank you so
much, Pastor Donna.

1206
01:08:03,746 --> 01:08:05,747
It means so much to me.

1207
01:08:05,748 --> 01:08:07,791
I must be a real slow learner,

1208
01:08:07,792 --> 01:08:09,501
here she was right
before my eyes,

1209
01:08:09,502 --> 01:08:11,127
this entire time.

1210
01:08:11,128 --> 01:08:13,129
Thank you for asking me, Cheo.

1211
01:08:13,130 --> 01:08:16,217
We will have a ball picking
out the perfect ring for her.

1212
01:08:20,262 --> 01:08:21,805
So yesterday
after Bible study,

1213
01:08:21,806 --> 01:08:23,807
I was talking to Pastor Donna.

1214
01:08:23,808 --> 01:08:25,183
Okay, what about?

1215
01:08:25,184 --> 01:08:26,184
And,

1216
01:08:28,979 --> 01:08:29,979
forget it.

1217
01:08:31,273 --> 01:08:33,274
Why'd you bring it up if
you weren't gonna tell me?

1218
01:08:33,275 --> 01:08:34,652
What'd you talk to her about?

1219
01:08:36,445 --> 01:08:38,029
Hey!

1220
01:08:38,030 --> 01:08:39,280
You hear that?

1221
01:08:39,281 --> 01:08:40,907
What did you talk
to Pastor Donna about?

1222
01:08:40,908 --> 01:08:42,575
Not right now,
Blue, come on, look.

1223
01:08:42,576 --> 01:08:44,244
You brought it up.

1224
01:08:44,245 --> 01:08:49,124
♪ They lean on hope

1225
01:08:49,125 --> 01:08:51,835

Hold on guys, say
hello to my manito, Che.

1231
01:09:16,443 --> 01:09:18,361
Hi Blue, how you doing?

1232
01:09:18,362 --> 01:09:19,238
Blessing to see you.

1233
01:09:19,239 --> 01:09:20,780
Always good to see you.

1234
01:09:20,781 --> 01:09:22,699
All right brother,
how you doing?

1235
01:09:22,700 --> 01:09:23,534
Always good.

1236
01:09:23,535 --> 01:09:25,034
Vic, how you doing?

1237
01:09:25,035 --> 01:09:27,537
Che, we're a little stuck
here, maybe you could help us.

1238
01:09:27,538 --> 01:09:30,916
Trying to come up with
a song, we're stuck.

1239
01:09:33,961 --> 01:09:36,546
Okay man, I feel
something coming.

1240
01:09:36,547 --> 01:09:37,839
May I make a suggestion?

1241
01:09:37,840 --> 01:09:39,716
Absolutely, please.

1242
01:09:39,717 --> 01:09:42,428
Tony, give me a mambo
beat on the bells.

1243
01:09:51,061 --> 01:09:52,938
Mike, on the congas.

1244
01:10:01,864 --> 01:10:04,575
Victor, let me hear
rock beat on the drums.

1245
01:10:10,289 --> 01:10:11,289
I like that.

1246
01:10:13,792 --> 01:10:15,711
Keep doing what you're doing.

1247
01:10:19,840 --> 01:10:23,593
Let's see, on my
cue guys, ready.

1248
01:10:23,594 --> 01:10:25,387
One, two, three.

1249
01:10:26,472 --> 01:10:31,477

01:12:42,983 --> 01:12:44,193

01:12:45,736 --> 01:12:46,736
Just kidding.

1265
01:12:49,406 --> 01:12:50,406
Hey Blue.

1266
01:12:54,036 --> 01:12:56,037
Hey Blue, it's me, Robbie.

1267
01:12:56,038 --> 01:12:57,538
We got Archie right here,
you don't remember us?

1268
01:12:57,539 --> 01:12:59,124
I guess you just startled me.

1269
01:13:00,376 --> 01:13:02,335
Didn't mean to
frighten you, beautiful.

1270
01:13:02,336 --> 01:13:04,420
I'm just running
late, so I gotta go.

1271
01:13:04,421 --> 01:13:06,757
No, ma, why you in
such a rush, stay.

1272
01:13:08,258 --> 01:13:09,258
Cheo's waiting.

1273
01:13:10,886 --> 01:13:13,596
Are you scared
of us or something?

1274
01:13:13,597 --> 01:13:15,014
I think she's scared
of us, Archie.

1275
01:13:15,015 --> 01:13:16,099
I think so too Robbie.

1276
01:13:16,100 --> 01:13:17,393
Girl, you look so good.

1277
01:13:18,602 --> 01:13:20,062
What perfume are you wearing?

1278
01:13:20,938 --> 01:13:22,730
You smell good, girl.

1279
01:13:22,731 --> 01:13:24,274
Hey, hey, not too fast, wait!

1280
01:13:25,359 --> 01:13:27,611
Okay Blue, okay, you wanna play?

1281
01:13:29,321 --> 01:13:30,280
Come here!

1282
01:13:30,281 --> 01:13:32,950
No, no, no, no, please.

1283
01:13:58,976 --> 01:14:00,185
Watch it.

1284
01:14:01,478 --> 01:14:02,812
Archie, Archie, let's
go, let's go, come on!

1285
01:14:02,813 --> 01:14:04,314
Come on, Archie!

1286
01:14:59,703 --> 01:15:02,497
From looks of it, it was
about 30, 40 minutes ago.

1287
01:15:02,498 --> 01:15:03,498
Okay.

1288
01:15:06,251 --> 01:15:07,251
No.

1289
01:15:11,381 --> 01:15:15,384
Sir, sir, can you
come this way please?

1290
01:15:15,385 --> 01:15:18,054
I heard the screaming
and I looked out

1291
01:15:18,055 --> 01:15:22,099
through my window and
I saw these two men

1292
01:15:22,100 --> 01:15:25,395
and they were brutalizing
this young woman.

1293
01:15:26,772 --> 01:15:28,692
Okay, did you get a good
look at the gentlemen?

1294
01:15:31,068 --> 01:15:35,738
Yeah, I see those punks
around here all the time.

1295
01:15:35,739 --> 01:15:39,201
A couple of losers,
total losers.

1296
01:15:40,077 --> 01:15:41,452
Wait, you said all the time?

1297
01:15:41,453 --> 01:15:42,912
Yeah.

1298
01:15:42,913 --> 01:15:45,331
You wouldn't happen to
know their names, would you?

1299
01:15:45,332 --> 01:15:46,332
Oh, um,

1300
01:15:47,834 --> 01:15:52,839
one's name is Ronnie and
the other one's name is,

1301
01:15:54,883 --> 01:15:58,928
let's see, Archie.

1302
01:15:58,929 --> 01:16:00,681
His name is Archie.

1303
01:16:04,268 --> 01:16:06,477
Can you remember
anything else?

1304
01:16:06,478 --> 01:16:09,605
No, it all happened
way too fast.

1305
01:16:09,606 --> 01:16:10,607
Okay, that's fine.

1306
01:16:12,526 --> 01:16:16,195
All right so, we're
gonna catch those guys.

1307
01:16:16,196 --> 01:16:19,615
If you remember else,
please give us a call.

1308
01:16:19,616 --> 01:16:20,950
- Right.
- Right.

1309
01:16:20,951 --> 01:16:21,951
Thank you sir.

1310
01:16:24,037 --> 01:16:27,665
You can go ahead,
I'll show you around.

1311
01:16:27,666 --> 01:16:28,666
Thank you.

1312
01:16:36,550 --> 01:16:39,802
Ma'am, last night a young
girl was found murdered.

1313
01:16:39,803 --> 01:16:41,053
Oh Lord.

1314
01:16:41,054 --> 01:16:43,764
We believe she
attended your church.

1315
01:16:43,765 --> 01:16:46,642
We found this brochure on her.

1316
01:16:46,643 --> 01:16:49,186
Also the library card
that was found on her body

1317
01:16:49,187 --> 01:16:51,356
stated her name was Blue Tahara.

1318
01:16:53,734 --> 01:16:54,901
Oh no.

1319
01:16:56,403 --> 01:17:00,615
Did you know her?

1320
01:17:00,616 --> 01:17:02,908
Yes, I know her.

1321
01:17:02,909 --> 01:17:07,581
She was about to be married
to Cheo, one of our ministers.

1322
01:17:10,417 --> 01:17:13,378
I'm sorry, does she have
any family in the area?

1323
01:17:16,340 --> 01:17:19,509
I know she has family
here but I don't know.

1324
01:17:20,594 --> 01:17:21,594
Cheo will know.

1325
01:17:24,056 --> 01:17:26,642
I'm just afraid this is
going to devastate him.

1326
01:17:29,102 --> 01:17:30,187
He'll relapse.

1327
01:17:32,939 --> 01:17:37,068
Would it be okay if I tell
Cheo what happened to Blue

1328
01:17:37,069 --> 01:17:41,490
and call you back later with
the contact information?

1329
01:17:43,992 --> 01:17:44,992
Yes, of course.

1330
01:17:46,411 --> 01:17:49,246
Here's my card, if
you think of anything,

1331
01:17:49,247 --> 01:17:50,415
please, give me a call.

1332
01:17:52,417 --> 01:17:53,417
Thank you.

1333
01:18:00,801 --> 01:18:01,801
Cheo?

1334
01:18:03,887 --> 01:18:06,848
Cheo, I need to
tell you something.

1335
01:18:08,809 --> 01:18:11,936
I don't know how to tell you.

1336
01:18:11,937 --> 01:18:14,106
The police were just here.

1337
01:18:16,400 --> 01:18:17,400
Blue's dead.

1338
01:18:20,696 --> 01:18:22,072
They found her in the park.

1339
01:18:25,659 --> 01:18:28,078
We're gonna get through this.

1340
01:18:29,371 --> 01:18:31,748
We're gonna get through this.

1341
01:18:33,875 --> 01:18:34,875
I know, I.

1342
01:18:53,145 --> 01:18:54,271
Why did this happen?

1343
01:19:07,826 --> 01:19:09,618
Hey, what's up Cheo?

1344
01:19:09,619 --> 01:19:11,705
You gonna come in and
let me buy you a drink?

1345
01:19:12,706 --> 01:19:13,706
Chava's up in here.

1346
01:19:20,464 --> 01:19:23,174
I heard about what those
punks did to your old lady.

1347
01:19:23,175 --> 01:19:25,968
They'll get theirs when
they get into the pen.

1348
01:19:25,969 --> 01:19:27,888
The pen'll take care
of that for you.

1349
01:19:28,972 --> 01:19:30,557
We live in a fallen world bro.

1350
01:19:32,017 --> 01:19:34,560
Punks about to live the rest
of their lives behind bars.

1351
01:19:34,561 --> 01:19:36,061
That's not living, Guillermo.

1352
01:19:36,062 --> 01:19:37,313
That's deep Cheo.

1353
01:19:37,314 --> 01:19:39,316
But a couple shanks to
the heart and lungs,

1354
01:19:40,484 --> 01:19:42,486
would feel good too, you
know what I'm saying.

1355
01:19:44,863 --> 01:19:46,405
It was good seeing you bro.

1356
01:19:46,406 --> 01:19:47,824
All right, bro.

1357
01:19:49,117 --> 01:19:51,786
Chava, can I talk
to you for a moment?

1358
01:19:51,787 --> 01:19:53,245
Yeah, I heard about Blue.

1359
01:19:53,246 --> 01:19:54,830
Sorry, man.

1360
01:19:54,831 --> 01:19:56,665
How are you holding up?

1361
01:19:56,666 --> 01:19:59,210
This has got to be one
of the hardest things.

1362
01:19:59,211 --> 01:20:01,213
And I thought fighting
addiction was tough.

1363
01:20:02,172 --> 01:20:03,964
Don't worry about it, Carnal.

1364
01:20:03,965 --> 01:20:06,259
We got your back with
whatever you might need.

1365
01:20:09,095 --> 01:20:10,735
There is one thing
you can help me with.

1366
01:20:11,348 --> 01:20:13,516
Tomorrow's Blue's funeral.

1367
01:20:13,517 --> 01:20:14,601
She loved low-lows.

1368
01:20:15,769 --> 01:20:17,813
I was hoping you could
get the horse together.

1369
01:20:19,773 --> 01:20:22,900
For you and for Blue,
let me know what time,

1370
01:20:22,901 --> 01:20:23,985
we'll be there, okay?

1371
01:20:25,487 --> 01:20:26,487
Thank you, bro.

1372
01:20:27,280 --> 01:20:28,281
Keep that head up.

1373
01:22:58,848 --> 01:23:00,642
This place hasn't
changed one bit.

1374
01:23:02,018 --> 01:23:03,019
Cheo, is that you?

1375
01:23:05,897 --> 01:23:08,482
Mama, Vinnie, look who I found!

1376
01:23:08,483 --> 01:23:11,485
Cheo, mijo, you're back!

1377
01:23:11,486 --> 01:23:13,946
I missed you so much,
welcome back home.

1378
01:23:13,947 --> 01:23:17,491
Man, I haven't seen
you since the funeral.

1379
01:23:17,492 --> 01:23:18,535
Why you so skinny?

1380
01:23:19,703 --> 01:23:21,079
Is that a cross
around your neck.

1381
01:23:22,080 --> 01:23:23,330
It's for the best,

1382
01:23:23,331 --> 01:23:25,499
but I missed you
guys all so much.

1383
01:23:25,500 --> 01:23:26,875
So did you bring us anything?

1384
01:23:26,876 --> 01:23:28,460
Yeah, me!

1385
01:23:28,461 --> 01:23:30,129
You ain't nothin' special.

1386
01:23:30,130 --> 01:23:31,463
Never said I was.

1387
01:23:31,464 --> 01:23:32,881
You asked if I
brought something and,

1388
01:23:32,882 --> 01:23:34,300
bada-bing, here I am.

1389
01:23:35,802 --> 01:23:38,303
So mom, are you still
working at the airport?

1390
01:23:38,304 --> 01:23:39,723
18 years now, mijo.

1391
01:23:41,016 --> 01:23:44,309
Getting ready to
retire, I wanna travel.

1392
01:23:44,310 --> 01:23:45,686
Why didn't you stop by?

1393
01:23:45,687 --> 01:23:47,604
All that matters
is that you're happy

1394
01:23:47,605 --> 01:23:49,231
and you're back home with us.

1395
01:23:49,232 --> 01:23:52,317
Thanks mom, and I was actually

1396
01:23:52,318 --> 01:23:54,111
at the New Hope Rescue Mission.

1397
01:23:54,112 --> 01:23:55,404
Why?

1398
01:23:55,405 --> 01:23:57,156
What was at the New
Hope Rescue Mission

1399
01:23:57,157 --> 01:23:58,950
that kept you from
coming back home?

1400
01:23:59,909 --> 01:24:00,909
Well, you see,

1401
01:24:02,037 --> 01:24:04,663
all the bad choices
took me to a dark place

1402
01:24:04,664 --> 01:24:06,249
and I wasn't happy.

1403
01:24:07,584 --> 01:24:08,834
I was living only for myself

1404
01:24:08,835 --> 01:24:10,462
and felt like I
was wasting away.

1405
01:24:11,671 --> 01:24:15,132
But I was finally able
to get what I needed.

1406
01:24:15,133 --> 01:24:17,760
I was able to find my
peace and joy in life.

1407
01:24:17,761 --> 01:24:19,344
He got sucked into
the dad syndrome

1408
01:24:19,345 --> 01:24:21,013
instead of focusing on himself

1409
01:24:21,014 --> 01:24:22,974
and getting into the
alcohol and women.

1410
01:24:26,936 --> 01:24:27,936
Sorry ma.

1411
01:24:30,106 --> 01:24:32,107
I will say that,
they took me in,

1412
01:24:32,108 --> 01:24:36,028
they fed me, they taught
me how to cook and clean,

1413
01:24:36,029 --> 01:24:37,530
and they got me back on track.

1414
01:24:38,531 --> 01:24:41,116
Cheo, I'm happy you're home.

1415
01:24:41,117 --> 01:24:43,994
I'm glad you found something
that works for you.

1416
01:24:43,995 --> 01:24:46,288
Bro, the white man
brain washed you.

1417
01:24:46,289 --> 01:24:48,248
They love volunteers.

1418
01:24:48,249 --> 01:24:50,584
Or you can call it
some slave labor.

1419
01:24:50,585 --> 01:24:52,086
You're just a sucka.

1420
01:24:52,087 --> 01:24:53,087
Vinnie, shut up.

1421
01:24:54,172 --> 01:24:56,632
Hey George, remember
when they used

1422
01:24:56,633 --> 01:24:58,384
to say that Jesus
died for our sins?

1423
01:24:59,469 --> 01:25:01,261
Yeah, I remember that.

1424
01:25:01,262 --> 01:25:04,182
Well I never understood
what that meant until now.

1425
01:25:05,517 --> 01:25:07,810
So are you clean now, Cheo?

1426
01:25:07,811 --> 01:25:10,813
Five years, one month,
17 days, to be exact.

1427
01:25:10,814 --> 01:25:12,482
I'm so proud of you, Cheo.

1428
01:25:13,525 --> 01:25:14,983
Thank you.

1429
01:25:14,984 --> 01:25:17,821
By the way, any of you
guys seen Eli lately?

1430
01:25:19,739 --> 01:25:21,865
I haven't seen him for years.

1431
01:25:21,866 --> 01:25:24,118
I heard that he moved.

1432
01:25:24,119 --> 01:25:26,161
Maybe you can go down
and talk to Teresa

1433
01:25:26,162 --> 01:25:28,039
and she might tell
you where he's at.

1434
01:25:29,499 --> 01:25:30,999
Yeah.

1435
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:35,630
Meanwhile, mama's gonna fix
my chacito his favorite dinner

1436
01:25:36,339 --> 01:25:38,340
so we can celebrate.

1437
01:25:38,341 --> 01:25:39,341
Vamos!

1438
01:25:44,139 --> 01:25:45,139
Hello Ms. Cole?

1439
01:25:49,477 --> 01:25:51,103
It's Cheo.

1440
01:25:51,104 --> 01:25:52,521
Cheo Colorado.

1441
01:25:52,522 --> 01:25:53,690
Cheo Colorado, wow.

1442
01:25:56,651 --> 01:25:59,362
I haven't heard that name in
such a long time, come in.

1443
01:26:00,697 --> 01:26:03,365
How have you been doing?

1444
01:26:03,366 --> 01:26:04,200
Good.

1445
01:26:04,201 --> 01:26:05,451
Goodness, come on in.

1446
01:26:06,452 --> 01:26:08,453
Don't mind the mess around here.

1447
01:26:08,454 --> 01:26:10,164
Don't worry
about it, Ms. Cole.

1448
01:26:10,165 --> 01:26:12,876
Come on in, let me get you
something in the kitchen.

1449
01:26:13,710 --> 01:26:14,878
So how have you been?

1450
01:26:16,379 --> 01:26:17,880
Oh I'm fine honey, I'm just,

1451
01:26:17,881 --> 01:26:20,215
I'm just enjoying my
glass of chardonnay,

1452
01:26:20,216 --> 01:26:22,593
waiting for Eli
to come visit me.

1453
01:26:22,594 --> 01:26:24,386
I'm sorry, is this a bad time?

1454
01:26:24,387 --> 01:26:26,221
No, silly, it's fine.

1455
01:26:26,222 --> 01:26:28,223
You know, I'm just
waiting on Eli,

1456
01:26:28,224 --> 01:26:30,143
he's gonna bring
me by some money.

1457
01:26:31,060 --> 01:26:33,103
Have you talked to him?

1458
01:26:33,104 --> 01:26:35,564
To be honest, I just
released myself from

1459
01:26:35,565 --> 01:26:38,066
a men's home, cleaned myself up.

1460
01:26:38,067 --> 01:26:40,778
I had a rough patch and needed
some spiritual guidance.

1461
01:26:41,738 --> 01:26:43,405
Well you look good.

1462
01:26:43,406 --> 01:26:46,491
You know, it's nice to see
a familiar face around here.

1463
01:26:46,492 --> 01:26:48,994
I can remember when you and Eli

1464
01:26:48,995 --> 01:26:51,205
were playing music
in your living room

1465
01:26:51,206 --> 01:26:54,333
and you kept all of
Peoria street up.

1466
01:26:54,334 --> 01:26:57,002
Yeah, those were
the good times.

1467
01:26:57,003 --> 01:27:00,797
You know, life can
be so severe, you know,

1468
01:27:00,798 --> 01:27:03,175
how things can change over time

1469
01:27:03,176 --> 01:27:04,969
and you know, it
can be really hard.

1470
01:27:05,970 --> 01:27:07,679
You're telling me.

1471
01:27:07,680 --> 01:27:09,264
It's been awhile
and I never expected

1472
01:27:09,265 --> 01:27:11,767
I would be out on
my own for so long.

1473
01:27:11,768 --> 01:27:15,270
But I guess that's what the
Lord had in store for me.

1474
01:27:15,271 --> 01:27:19,441
When Eli got big, it got
really hectic around here.

1475
01:27:19,442 --> 01:27:22,903
Between the money, fans, fame,

1476
01:27:22,904 --> 01:27:24,571
you know, it got really crazy

1477
01:27:24,572 --> 01:27:27,115
but we really needed the money.

1478
01:27:27,116 --> 01:27:28,283
Eli got big?

1479
01:27:28,284 --> 01:27:29,661
You didn't hear?

1480
01:27:30,870 --> 01:27:32,121
He got a record deal.

1481
01:27:33,289 --> 01:27:34,873
And they gave him
a big signing bonus

1482
01:27:34,874 --> 01:27:37,000
about five years ago.

1483
01:27:37,001 --> 01:27:38,377
Really?

1484
01:27:38,378 --> 01:27:39,379
I did not know that.

1485
01:27:42,173 --> 01:27:43,423
How's it going, man?

1486
01:27:43,424 --> 01:27:44,591
It's good to see you, brother.

1487
01:27:44,592 --> 01:27:46,260
How you been?

1488
01:27:46,261 --> 01:27:48,303
I'm doing much better lately.

1489
01:27:48,304 --> 01:27:50,430
After everything with
Blue, I just needed

1490
01:27:50,431 --> 01:27:52,808
some space to find
myself and whatnot.

1491
01:27:52,809 --> 01:27:54,309
I wasn't expecting
you to be here, man.

1492
01:27:54,310 --> 01:27:55,644
It's definitely a surprise,

1493
01:27:55,645 --> 01:27:56,604
I can tell you that much.

1494
01:27:56,605 --> 01:27:59,314
And Blue, man I miss her.

1495
01:27:59,315 --> 01:28:00,566
Yeah, I miss her too.

1496
01:28:01,818 --> 01:28:04,194
But I was in the
neighborhood visiting my mom

1497
01:28:04,195 --> 01:28:06,781
and I kinda wanted to
visit you and your mom.

1498
01:28:07,657 --> 01:28:08,824
You know, catch up.

1499
01:28:08,825 --> 01:28:09,659
I'm definitely glad
you're doing great, man.

1500
01:28:09,660 --> 01:28:11,535
Hey, you look good.

1501
01:28:11,536 --> 01:28:12,577
Hey mom, how you doing?

1502
01:28:12,578 --> 01:28:13,829
Hey, how you doing?

1503
01:28:13,830 --> 01:28:15,372
I'm just fixing some
drinks for everyone,

1504
01:28:15,373 --> 01:28:17,082
Cheo, would you like something?

1505
01:28:17,083 --> 01:28:18,750
I'm okay, Ms. Cole, thank you.

1506
01:28:18,751 --> 01:28:20,335
Hey mom, before I
forget, here's a check.

1507
01:28:20,336 --> 01:28:22,005
Thank you so much.

1508
01:28:25,508 --> 01:28:27,426
So, I heard you made it big.

1509
01:28:27,427 --> 01:28:28,802
Yeah, something like that man.

1510
01:28:28,803 --> 01:28:29,803
You know, I just get focused

1511
01:28:29,804 --> 01:28:31,346
and somehow somewhat.

1512
01:28:31,347 --> 01:28:33,307
So I got noticed along
the way, that's all.

1513
01:28:33,308 --> 01:28:34,808
That's good,
I'm happy for you.

1514
01:28:34,809 --> 01:28:35,851
Thanks man.

1515
01:28:35,852 --> 01:28:37,853
Hey so how long has it been?

1516
01:28:37,854 --> 01:28:40,731
About five years.

1517
01:28:40,732 --> 01:28:41,857
Has it been that long?

1518
01:28:41,858 --> 01:28:43,150
My god.

1519
01:28:43,151 --> 01:28:44,651
What's been going
on with you lately?

1520
01:28:44,652 --> 01:28:46,528
Well I'm about to get in the
studio with Deville Records

1521
01:28:46,529 --> 01:28:47,904
you know, I'm about
to do my 3rd album.

1522
01:28:47,905 --> 01:28:49,823
2nd one wasn't too great,

1523
01:28:49,824 --> 01:28:51,074
you know, I gotta
keep going at it

1524
01:28:51,075 --> 01:28:53,952
to keep my mom and
I going, you know?

1525
01:28:53,953 --> 01:28:56,121
Hey I actually just got
back the UK from a tour.

1526
01:28:56,122 --> 01:28:58,290
Nice, me and mom were
actually just talking

1527
01:28:58,291 --> 01:28:59,416
about how time flies.

1528
01:28:59,417 --> 01:29:00,876
Isn't it crazy?

1529
01:29:00,877 --> 01:29:02,085
Right man, one day we're
chilling in your room,

1530
01:29:02,086 --> 01:29:04,296
cranking up that music
mix, you know it.

1531
01:29:04,297 --> 01:29:06,548
Well everything happens
for a reason, Eli.

1532
01:29:06,549 --> 01:29:08,925
Just keep in mine, the
Lord is truly what matters

1533
01:29:08,926 --> 01:29:11,428
in life, Blue's here one day

1534
01:29:11,429 --> 01:29:12,889
and the next, she's with God.

1535
01:29:14,432 --> 01:29:15,932
So what happened
between us, man?

1536
01:29:15,933 --> 01:29:17,309
We used to be so tight.

1537
01:29:17,310 --> 01:29:19,936
The Lord just had a
different path for us, I guess.

1538
01:29:19,937 --> 01:29:22,898
You keep saying the Lord,
as in like, Jesus Christ?

1539
01:29:22,899 --> 01:29:23,899
Yeah man.

1540
01:29:24,984 --> 01:29:26,026
So what's up, is that

1541
01:29:26,027 --> 01:29:27,027
what you've been learning about

1542
01:29:27,028 --> 01:29:28,236
these five years
cause you've got

1543
01:29:28,237 --> 01:29:29,404
some type of peace
about you now.

1544
01:29:29,405 --> 01:29:31,656
I found Christ, I'm a new man.

1545
01:29:31,657 --> 01:29:32,575
Well I'm all messed up man,

1546
01:29:32,576 --> 01:29:33,784
I've gotta get my act together,

1547
01:29:33,785 --> 01:29:35,535
so much is going on right now.

1548
01:29:35,536 --> 01:29:36,578
Anything you wanna talk about?

1549
01:29:36,579 --> 01:29:37,746
Oh just label pressure,

1550
01:29:37,747 --> 01:29:40,040
and this whole money
thing, I guess.

1551
01:29:40,041 --> 01:29:42,751
Your mom said you
had a signing bonus.

1552
01:29:42,752 --> 01:29:44,252
Something like that, man.

1553
01:29:44,253 --> 01:29:46,296
But you know what, there's
so many damn expenses.

1554
01:29:46,297 --> 01:29:47,798
And you know, I'm starting
to have my mom slip away

1555
01:29:47,799 --> 01:29:49,091
with this drinking thing.

1556
01:29:49,092 --> 01:29:50,051
You know what,
think about getting

1557
01:29:50,052 --> 01:29:51,927
a call from the cops at 2am

1558
01:29:51,928 --> 01:29:53,136
telling you that
your mom is drunk

1559
01:29:53,137 --> 01:29:55,055
and out of control at
the Connection Bar.

1560
01:29:55,056 --> 01:29:57,724
You know, I'm dealing with
those type of distractions.

1561
01:29:57,725 --> 01:29:58,559
That's rough.

1562
01:29:58,559 --> 01:29:59,519
Yeah man.

1563
01:29:59,520 --> 01:30:01,103
I'll keep you in prayer.

1564
01:30:01,104 --> 01:30:04,064
But you do solo
work or group stuff?

1565
01:30:04,065 --> 01:30:06,233
I'm doing solo with
some temp musicians

1566
01:30:06,234 --> 01:30:08,694
in the studio, if it's not
one thing, it's the other.

1567
01:30:09,779 --> 01:30:10,780
Why don't we pray?

1568
01:30:12,698 --> 01:30:13,574
You know that's
not my thing man,

1569
01:30:13,575 --> 01:30:14,617
you should know that.

1570
01:30:15,743 --> 01:30:18,120
Just remember,
it's all because

1571
01:30:18,121 --> 01:30:20,163
of Jesus that you're
where you're at.

1572
01:30:20,164 --> 01:30:21,415
The gratitude is there bro,

1573
01:30:21,416 --> 01:30:23,625
but you know what, I'm
just so damn tired man,

1574
01:30:23,626 --> 01:30:24,626
I'm tired.

1575
01:30:25,962 --> 01:30:29,298
I wanna just go back to
18 or something, yeah.

1576
01:30:41,853 --> 01:30:46,148
Hey Eli, let's play
Cheo one of your singles.

1577
01:30:46,149 --> 01:30:47,816
You know, he could
use a good tune

1578
01:30:47,817 --> 01:30:49,359
after being out of
society for years.

1579
01:30:49,360 --> 01:30:51,862
Mom, mom, not right now.

1580
01:30:51,863 --> 01:30:53,071
We're going to grab
something to eat, all right?

1581
01:30:53,072 --> 01:30:54,489
I don't mind, let's
hear your stuff.

1582
01:30:54,490 --> 01:30:56,950
Don't be stingy Eli,

1583
01:30:56,951 --> 01:30:58,493
this is close to my heart now.

1584
01:30:58,494 --> 01:31:00,579
Now this tune, this is the one

1585
01:31:00,580 --> 01:31:03,957
that Deville Records was
really interested in.

1586
01:31:03,958 --> 01:31:05,667
And it rocketed
my son to stardom

1587
01:31:05,668 --> 01:31:08,503
and made him famous
and now we're rich.

1588
01:31:08,504 --> 01:31:10,755
Sounds familiar.

1589
01:31:10,756 --> 01:31:12,174
You got signed by
Deville Records?

1590
01:31:12,175 --> 01:31:13,175
Yeah man.

1591
01:31:14,385 --> 01:31:16,803
Sounds a little familiar,
that's for sure.

1592
01:31:16,804 --> 01:31:18,722
Turn it up, that's the keyboard.

1593
01:31:18,723 --> 01:31:20,056
Nah man, we don't
gotta listen to this man,

1594
01:31:20,057 --> 01:31:21,850
it's outdated and it's
old if you ask me.

1595
01:31:21,851 --> 01:31:24,186
So come on, let's get
those burgers, yeah?

1596
01:31:24,187 --> 01:31:25,520
I'm not really that hungry.

1597
01:31:25,521 --> 01:31:27,814
I just realized the
time, I gotta get going.

1598
01:31:27,815 --> 01:31:29,316
I promised my mom
I'd say bye to her

1599
01:31:29,317 --> 01:31:30,775
before she goes to work.

1600
01:31:30,776 --> 01:31:32,027
Are you sure, come on,
it'll be my treat, come on.

1601
01:31:32,028 --> 01:31:33,570
Yeah man, I didn't
mean to intrude.

1602
01:31:33,571 --> 01:31:34,779
Do you mind saying bye
to your mom for me?

1603
01:31:34,780 --> 01:31:36,490
Nah man, just stay,
chill with my mom,

1604
01:31:36,491 --> 01:31:37,616
you can do the whole
prayer stuff too

1605
01:31:37,617 --> 01:31:39,201
if you want to.

1606
01:31:39,202 --> 01:31:40,911
It was educational
to say the least.

1607
01:31:40,912 --> 01:31:43,539
But good luck with the
career, take care my brother.

1608
01:31:46,751 --> 01:31:47,751
Ay yo, Cheo.

1609
01:31:48,878 --> 01:31:50,171
Take care of yourself, man.

1610
01:32:09,398 --> 01:32:11,358
Mr. Cole, it's so
wonderful to see you,

1611
01:32:11,359 --> 01:32:12,400
how have you been?

1612
01:32:12,401 --> 01:32:13,652
Good, and yourself?

1613
01:32:13,653 --> 01:32:14,945
Oh very good, you
here to see Mr. West?

1614
01:32:14,946 --> 01:32:15,863
Yeah, can you call him up?

1615
01:32:15,864 --> 01:32:16,906
Yes I will.

1616
01:32:19,075 --> 01:32:20,367
You're already in
the conference room?

1617
01:32:20,368 --> 01:32:22,662
All right, I'll bring
him right in, thank you.

1618
01:32:24,789 --> 01:32:27,791
Eli, good to see
you, come on in.

1619
01:32:27,792 --> 01:32:30,210
Did it really take
us 12 voice messages

1620
01:32:30,211 --> 01:32:31,419
to get you down here?

1621
01:32:31,420 --> 01:32:32,420
Have a seat.

1622
01:32:35,007 --> 01:32:37,092
I'm glad you got back
to me when you did.

1623
01:32:37,093 --> 01:32:40,303
We, the label, have a few
things we wanna clear up

1624
01:32:40,304 --> 01:32:41,347
and discuss with you.

1625
01:32:42,557 --> 01:32:44,057
So again, thanks for coming in.

1626
01:32:44,058 --> 01:32:45,350
Wait, wait, hold
up, hold up, hold up,

1627
01:32:45,351 --> 01:32:46,643
what things?

1628
01:32:46,644 --> 01:32:49,229
Well, you got my
messages, right?

1629
01:32:49,230 --> 01:32:51,940
About the legal
issues and the hold up

1630
01:32:51,941 --> 01:32:53,858
on some of the tracks
on the new album?

1631
01:32:53,859 --> 01:32:55,151
So now they're
saying I stole it?

1632
01:32:55,152 --> 01:32:56,611
No, no, there's
just some samples

1633
01:32:56,612 --> 01:32:58,947
that our people
felt might be better

1634
01:32:58,948 --> 01:33:01,951
if we had certain channels
getting the rights to.

1635
01:33:03,369 --> 01:33:05,036
Unfortunately these channels
take a little more time

1636
01:33:05,037 --> 01:33:06,454
than usual.

1637
01:33:06,455 --> 01:33:10,083
Look Eli, you're becoming
a major artist here.

1638
01:33:10,084 --> 01:33:12,127
We just wanna make sure
that you're covered

1639
01:33:12,128 --> 01:33:15,589
and your work is
totally untouchable.

1640
01:33:15,590 --> 01:33:17,632
All right so what's
up, is that it?

1641
01:33:17,633 --> 01:33:19,467
No Eli, these legal checks

1642
01:33:19,468 --> 01:33:21,720
are just a minor
bump on our end.

1643
01:33:21,721 --> 01:33:23,638
To be honest, we'd like
you to submit more work

1644
01:33:23,639 --> 01:33:25,390
so that our people
can arrange it

1645
01:33:25,391 --> 01:33:26,600
and make a final product.

1646
01:33:26,601 --> 01:33:27,767
So you want more?

1647
01:33:27,768 --> 01:33:29,894
Yeah, we're
going to need more.

1648
01:33:29,895 --> 01:33:31,771
A lot more Eli.

1649
01:33:31,772 --> 01:33:33,398
That's what we do here.

1650
01:33:33,399 --> 01:33:36,110
We pay you, you produce for us.

1651
01:33:37,028 --> 01:33:38,403
It's not hard, is it?

1652
01:33:38,404 --> 01:33:39,821
At least it should not be.

1653
01:33:39,822 --> 01:33:41,865
It'd be best if
you just give us

1654
01:33:41,866 --> 01:33:43,450
as much finished
product as possible

1655
01:33:43,451 --> 01:33:45,493
so that you and the
record can get moving

1656
01:33:45,494 --> 01:33:46,620
on the next album which is due

1657
01:33:46,621 --> 01:33:47,913
by the end of the quarter.

1658
01:33:48,831 --> 01:33:50,081
You guys are serious?

1659
01:33:50,082 --> 01:33:52,167
The next quarter, no
freakin' way, man.

1660
01:33:52,168 --> 01:33:53,668
What's the problem?

1661
01:33:53,669 --> 01:33:55,128
The problem is I'm gonna
give you guys everything

1662
01:33:55,129 --> 01:33:57,172
so you guys can have some
two bit editor hack my music.

1663
01:33:57,173 --> 01:33:59,716
What about we terminate
your contract right here,

1664
01:33:59,717 --> 01:34:02,552
right now and stop your
payroll immediately?

1665
01:34:02,553 --> 01:34:03,554
How does that sound?

1666
01:34:05,681 --> 01:34:08,600
The time, the money
invested in you,

1667
01:34:08,601 --> 01:34:09,934
everything is going to waste.

1668
01:34:09,935 --> 01:34:11,186
Oh really?

1669
01:34:11,187 --> 01:34:13,647
Yes, there is no
way you are going

1670
01:34:13,648 --> 01:34:15,357
to meet this tight of deadline.

1671
01:34:15,358 --> 01:34:17,359
Especially since
we are seeing both

1672
01:34:17,360 --> 01:34:19,987
the quantity and quality
of your work already.

1673
01:34:21,238 --> 01:34:22,489
You don't work with us,

1674
01:34:22,490 --> 01:34:23,948
we do not work with you.

1675
01:34:23,949 --> 01:34:25,367
Simple as that.

1676
01:34:25,368 --> 01:34:26,786
No more dodging our calls.

1677
01:34:27,912 --> 01:34:30,705
Or I will request,
as per your contract,

1678
01:34:30,706 --> 01:34:32,874
this is a business, little man,

1679
01:34:32,875 --> 01:34:35,001
if you do not wish
to pick up the phone,

1680
01:34:35,002 --> 01:34:35,795
someone else will...

1681
01:34:35,796 --> 01:34:37,045
What the hell man?

1682
01:34:37,046 --> 01:34:38,463
The sweat and tears
that I put into this?

1683
01:34:38,464 --> 01:34:40,674
So not only are you guys
saying that my stuff is late,

1684
01:34:40,675 --> 01:34:41,675
you're saying that
my stuff is not good,

1685
01:34:41,676 --> 01:34:42,884
this is my art, man.

1686
01:34:42,885 --> 01:34:44,511
And I've made you guys
some damn good dough

1687
01:34:44,512 --> 01:34:45,679
if I say so myself.

1688
01:34:45,680 --> 01:34:47,138
You know what?

1689
01:34:47,139 --> 01:34:48,723
My new stuff, yeah my new
stuff's gonna be dope.

1690
01:34:48,724 --> 01:34:50,392
It's gonna be?

1691
01:34:50,393 --> 01:34:51,726
It has been watered down.

1692
01:34:51,727 --> 01:34:54,854
Your work really
speaks for itself.

1693
01:34:54,855 --> 01:34:56,564
I am not going to
allow this contract

1694
01:34:56,565 --> 01:34:58,733
to be taken advantage of.

1695
01:34:58,734 --> 01:35:01,194
I'm not going to
wait any longer.

1696
01:35:01,195 --> 01:35:05,365
Deal with nor should I put
any of your shortcomings.

1697
01:35:05,366 --> 01:35:06,658
You give me one good reason,

1698
01:35:06,659 --> 01:35:08,743
just one, why I
should not terminate

1699
01:35:08,744 --> 01:35:09,995
the contract right now.

1700
01:35:11,163 --> 01:35:14,249
Eli, we just wanna get
to the bottom of this.

1701
01:35:14,250 --> 01:35:16,001
Please sit, please.

1702
01:35:19,088 --> 01:35:21,298
We also have here, a
copy of your contract.

1703
01:35:23,092 --> 01:35:24,592
Just in case you need to review

1704
01:35:24,593 --> 01:35:25,886
your responsibilities.

1705
01:35:26,929 --> 01:35:28,513
Good doing business with you.

1706
01:35:28,514 --> 01:35:30,349
I knew you would see it my way.

1707
01:35:40,192 --> 01:35:45,197
I'm sorry for everything,
can you forgive me?

1708
01:35:48,242 --> 01:35:49,827
What if I need you?

1709
01:35:51,036 --> 01:35:53,329
Are you using me?

1710
01:35:53,330 --> 01:35:56,708
You don't love me,
you don't love me.

1711
01:35:56,709 --> 01:35:58,418
Anybody, anybody?

1712
01:35:58,419 --> 01:35:59,253
Everything to you is about Cheo,

1713
01:35:59,254 --> 01:36:01,212
what about me, huh?

1714
01:36:01,213 --> 01:36:02,505
What about me?

1715
01:36:02,506 --> 01:36:05,133
You helped Cheo, can you
help me back, please,

1716
01:36:05,134 --> 01:36:07,302
Jesus, give me a
rope, forgive me,

1717
01:36:07,303 --> 01:36:10,014
I'm sorry, I need
you to help me.

1718
01:36:13,267 --> 01:36:14,267
Eli!

1719
01:36:16,979 --> 01:36:18,731
He's gone, he's gone!

1720
01:36:20,065 --> 01:36:22,401
Eli, Eli stay with me, help!

1721
01:36:40,294 --> 01:36:43,296
Father God, you say
when we're at our weakest,

1722
01:36:43,297 --> 01:36:45,840
you're at your strongest.

1723
01:36:45,841 --> 01:36:47,759
Lord you also say that
you will never leave us

1724
01:36:47,760 --> 01:36:49,011
nor forsake us.

1725
01:36:50,179 --> 01:36:51,889
Please Lord, please.

1726
01:36:53,307 --> 01:36:56,017
I pray that you put a
hedge of angels protecting

1727
01:36:56,018 --> 01:36:57,852
and surrounding Eli.

1728
01:36:57,853 --> 01:36:59,103
And that the enemy be bound

1729
01:36:59,104 --> 01:37:01,023
and cast it back to
where it belongs.

1730
01:37:02,358 --> 01:37:05,152
In Jesus's holy and
powerful name, I pray, amen.

1731
01:37:12,159 --> 01:37:13,576
Welcome back, Eli.

1732
01:37:13,577 --> 01:37:14,411
How are you feeling?

1733
01:37:14,412 --> 01:37:15,870
Can you talk?

1734
01:37:15,871 --> 01:37:17,205
You know, you almost drowned?

1735
01:37:17,206 --> 01:37:18,206
Can you hear me?

1736
01:37:22,795 --> 01:37:25,214
Can I listen to your
heart and lungs?

1737
01:37:32,179 --> 01:37:33,931
Can you take some
deep breaths for me?

1738
01:37:41,063 --> 01:37:43,565
Can you tell me what
happened to you?

1739
01:37:43,566 --> 01:37:45,024
No.

1740
01:37:45,025 --> 01:37:46,609
Think I fell down.

1741
01:37:46,610 --> 01:37:48,403
Well you must have an
angel watching over you

1742
01:37:48,404 --> 01:37:49,738
because you survived.

1743
01:37:55,661 --> 01:37:58,162
I can see that
you're feeling well.

1744
01:37:58,163 --> 01:37:59,747
I'm gonna check on
you tomorrow and try

1745
01:37:59,748 --> 01:38:01,124
to get you home soon, okay.

1746
01:38:01,125 --> 01:38:03,042
In the meanwhile, you will get

1747
01:38:03,043 --> 01:38:05,795
a visit from one of our
mental health physicians.

1748
01:38:05,796 --> 01:38:07,756
All right, feel better.

1749
01:38:45,878 --> 01:38:46,878
Hey Cheo.

1750
01:38:51,926 --> 01:38:56,013
Eli, I'm glad you're
alive and awake.

1751
01:38:56,889 --> 01:38:58,556
He heard our prayer.

1752
01:38:58,557 --> 01:38:59,557
How you feeling?

1753
01:39:00,601 --> 01:39:02,393
I'm feeling good, man.

1754
01:39:02,394 --> 01:39:04,021
I got the music you left me.

1755
01:39:05,439 --> 01:39:08,775
I'm sorry man, I didn't
mean to burn you like that.

1756
01:39:08,776 --> 01:39:10,360
Don't worry about it.

1757
01:39:10,361 --> 01:39:12,987
Life always tries to
take us out sometimes.

1758
01:39:12,988 --> 01:39:14,781
The music's yours, bro.

1759
01:39:14,782 --> 01:39:16,032
Still got that
glow about you, man.

1760
01:39:16,033 --> 01:39:17,326
And that peace.

1761
01:39:19,370 --> 01:39:21,413
I want that man, I want that.

1762
01:39:23,499 --> 01:39:24,499
It's because I found the Lord

1763
01:39:24,500 --> 01:39:26,251
at my lowest point of life.

1764
01:39:27,419 --> 01:39:28,920
He had a different
path in life for me

1765
01:39:28,921 --> 01:39:30,255
than what I had.

1766
01:39:31,632 --> 01:39:33,841
But he helped me get
through the loss of Blue.

1767
01:39:33,842 --> 01:39:35,552
So is this Jesus
thing for real?

1768
01:39:36,679 --> 01:39:38,471
It's as real as it comes.

1769
01:39:38,472 --> 01:39:41,265
And look, he saved you,

1770
01:39:41,266 --> 01:39:42,266
and here we are.

1771
01:39:43,310 --> 01:39:45,521
Hey, get some rest brother.

1772
01:39:52,361 --> 01:39:53,361
Hey Cheo.

1773
01:39:58,617 --> 01:40:00,201
Man, I know I
already told you this

1774
01:40:00,202 --> 01:40:03,038
but I'm sorry man, I'm sorry
for stealing your music.

1775
01:40:04,206 --> 01:40:05,999
I knew we were gonna
talk about this one day.

1776
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:07,709
But I didn't know I
was gonna ask you,

1777
01:40:07,710 --> 01:40:08,877
can you forgive me, man?

1778
01:40:11,463 --> 01:40:13,381
Eli, you mean much more to me

1779
01:40:13,382 --> 01:40:15,009
than any music or fame.

1780
01:40:16,010 --> 01:40:18,344
God has given me peace and joy.

1781
01:40:18,345 --> 01:40:21,014
And he's forgiven me
for all my shortcomings.

1782
01:40:21,015 --> 01:40:22,307
How can I not forgive you?

1783
01:40:24,018 --> 01:40:26,395
I just wish I was a
better friend to you, man.

1784
01:40:27,730 --> 01:40:29,063
How about we leave
the past in the past

1785
01:40:29,064 --> 01:40:31,524
and we start thinking
about our future?

1786
01:40:31,525 --> 01:40:33,527
I think it's time we
start making music.

1787
01:40:34,403 --> 01:40:36,029
And I'm talking your music.

1788
01:40:36,030 --> 01:40:37,030
You up for it?

1789
01:40:37,740 --> 01:40:39,116
What did you have in mind?

1790
01:40:49,251 --> 01:40:50,502
That was clean, bro.

1791
01:40:54,465 --> 01:40:55,965
So I think when the
chorus comes around

1792
01:40:55,966 --> 01:40:56,925
the second time, that's when

1793
01:40:56,926 --> 01:40:59,135
we can have the mini bass solo.

1794
01:40:59,136 --> 01:41:01,179
Exactly right,
but after the solo,

1795
01:41:01,180 --> 01:41:02,555
let's go straight
back into the slow jam

1796
01:41:02,556 --> 01:41:04,265
and into the outro because when

1797
01:41:04,266 --> 01:41:06,435
we pull those notes
out, it'll sound dope.

1798
01:41:07,603 --> 01:41:09,228
A little more keyboard
work here and there

1799
01:41:09,229 --> 01:41:10,438
and it'll be so strong,

1800
01:41:10,439 --> 01:41:11,939
you can feel the
power from the song.

1801
01:41:11,940 --> 01:41:14,442
Ain't gon' lie man, I have
a good feeling about this one.

1802
01:41:14,443 --> 01:41:15,693
Amen.

1803
01:41:15,694 --> 01:41:17,404
Hey Jim, pick up the bass.

1804
01:41:20,824 --> 01:41:22,201
Maybe a little midi here.

1805
01:41:24,953 --> 01:41:25,953
Nice.

1806
01:41:27,456 --> 01:41:28,456
No break.

1807
01:41:29,792 --> 01:41:32,126
Eli and Cheo, back at it again

1808
01:41:32,127 --> 01:41:33,461
with East Side Daly City.

1809
01:41:33,462 --> 01:41:35,380
Top of the hill.

1810
01:41:36,298 --> 01:41:37,538
When it all comes down to it,

1811
01:41:38,926 --> 01:41:39,967
the one thing from
my journey I can say

1812
01:41:39,968 --> 01:41:41,762
that stood out, was this.

1813
01:41:42,930 --> 01:41:45,098
Life happens in the
blink of an eye.

1814
01:41:45,099 --> 01:41:46,974
You asked me what I've learned,

1815
01:41:46,975 --> 01:41:47,975
so I'll tell you.

1816
01:41:49,394 --> 01:41:51,604
I learned the source
of forgiveness.

1817
01:41:51,605 --> 01:41:55,025
The source of love and
the source of peace.

1818
01:41:56,443 --> 01:42:00,363
In the end, it wasn't
about my passion for music.

1819
01:42:00,364 --> 01:42:01,657
Or my issues with Eli.

1820
01:42:02,825 --> 01:42:06,286
No, it was something a
little deeper inside.

1821
01:42:07,204 --> 01:42:08,413
Something you can't see.

1822
01:42:09,998 --> 01:42:12,000
I know now more than I did then.

1823
01:42:13,794 --> 01:42:15,336
You have to be able
to fill your heart

1824
01:42:15,337 --> 01:42:16,337
with God's love

1825
01:42:17,464 --> 01:42:20,091
because love can't be measured.

1826
01:42:20,092 --> 01:42:23,594
Love is the most important
and powerful word there is.

1827
01:42:23,595 --> 01:42:27,181
Jesus is love, God is love.

1828
01:42:27,182 --> 01:42:29,308
And the Holy Spirit is love.

1829
01:42:29,309 --> 01:42:33,272
And always remember who
the source of love is.
