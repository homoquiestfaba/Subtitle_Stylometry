1
00:02:27,791 --> 00:02:29,501
How my Reds looking this year, Joe?

2
00:02:29,583 --> 00:02:30,753
Sucking hind teat.

3
00:02:31,208 --> 00:02:32,668
Yankees re-signed Ruth.

4
00:02:33,541 --> 00:02:35,381
Thirty five thousand dollars,
you believe that?

5
00:02:35,416 --> 00:02:38,126
A man can work ten lifetimes
and not earn that kind of dough.

6
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:39,559
I could grow old on that.

7
00:02:39,583 --> 00:02:40,583
Amen.

8
00:03:06,916 --> 00:03:08,236
Hamilton!

9
00:03:17,958 --> 00:03:19,958
Where you been? Get your ass over here!

10
00:03:22,041 --> 00:03:23,631
Crowson, Hamilton's out of group again.

11
00:03:23,708 --> 00:03:25,538
I'll take him back. Ray, come on!

12
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:29,375
Drop your rifle.
Drop it.

13
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:37,750
Joe!

14
00:04:18,208 --> 00:04:19,208
Wait!

15
00:04:25,458 --> 00:04:26,458
Wait!

16
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,250
Wait!

17
00:04:32,041 --> 00:04:33,081
Ah!

18
00:04:46,125 --> 00:04:47,725
Care to comment on the escape, Governor?

19
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:48,790
Morning, boys.

20
00:04:48,958 --> 00:04:50,958
Ma, no one's ever
broken out of your prison.

21
00:04:51,125 --> 00:04:52,575
Bonnie and Clyde break in?

22
00:04:52,666 --> 00:04:54,666
They've been on the run for two years, Ma.

23
00:04:54,791 --> 00:04:57,631
Never say die, boys.
Say damned, never say die.

24
00:04:57,708 --> 00:05:00,348
Some folks are saying that
Parker and Barrow are heroes,

25
00:05:00,416 --> 00:05:01,746
calling them Robin Hoods.

26
00:05:01,916 --> 00:05:03,376
Are they Robin Hoods, Ma?

27
00:05:05,375 --> 00:05:08,245
Did Robin Hood ever shoot
a gas station attendant

28
00:05:08,333 --> 00:05:11,503
point blank in the head for four dollars
and a tank of gas?

29
00:05:12,666 --> 00:05:14,916
We will capture Clyde Barrow
and his paramore.

30
00:05:15,666 --> 00:05:17,746
Write that down and underline it twice.

31
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:23,920
One more question?

32
00:05:40,041 --> 00:05:43,041
If today was a fish,
I'd throw the son-of-a-bitch back.

33
00:05:45,916 --> 00:05:48,416
- How did it happen?
- Clyde did a nickel at Eastham.

34
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:52,290
He knew the the system, planted guns,
ran it like a military operation.

35
00:05:52,375 --> 00:05:53,375
Where are we on this?

36
00:05:53,458 --> 00:05:55,328
Hoover and the FEDS are proceeding...

37
00:05:55,416 --> 00:05:56,876
Where are <i>we</i> on this?

38
00:05:57,166 --> 00:05:59,706
- Dallas Detectives, Highway Patrol...
- My Ferguson agents.

39
00:05:59,791 --> 00:06:02,461
Same as the past
six months with no end in sight.

40
00:06:02,541 --> 00:06:04,381
Busted into your facility, Lee.

41
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:06,460
You're right, they did.

42
00:06:07,291 --> 00:06:09,211
Wounded one of my guards, killed another,

43
00:06:09,291 --> 00:06:12,041
died in my arms apologizing
for letting me down.

44
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:17,165
I'd like a say and how we handle this.

45
00:06:17,958 --> 00:06:18,958
Fine.

46
00:06:19,291 --> 00:06:20,331
Let's hear it.

47
00:06:21,166 --> 00:06:25,496
Was a time, we'd put a pair of man killers
on the trail and let them do their job.

48
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:27,580
Texas Rangers.

49
00:06:27,666 --> 00:06:28,746
Was a time

50
00:06:29,666 --> 00:06:30,786
and that time's past.

51
00:06:30,875 --> 00:06:32,785
This is 1934 Lee,

52
00:06:33,125 --> 00:06:35,535
and you want to put Cowboys
on Bonnie and Clyde?

53
00:06:35,625 --> 00:06:36,875
Is that what you're selling?

54
00:06:36,958 --> 00:06:37,998
Frank Hamer.

55
00:06:39,125 --> 00:06:40,495
That's what I'm selling.

56
00:06:41,958 --> 00:06:44,878
Well, sure.
Why don't we just go dig up Wyatt Earp.

57
00:06:44,958 --> 00:06:46,038
Wild Bill Hickok.

58
00:06:46,125 --> 00:06:48,665
Legislature disbanded the Rangers, Lee.

59
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:50,934
And you're right proud of it,
aren't you, Mrs. Governor?

60
00:06:50,958 --> 00:06:52,998
Damn right I am!
They took orders from no one,

61
00:06:53,083 --> 00:06:55,253
and they left me to answer for the blood.

62
00:06:55,333 --> 00:06:57,583
Seems like you're answering for it again.

63
00:07:00,333 --> 00:07:01,333
Governor,

64
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:04,380
Bonnie and Clyde have been
on the road for two years.

65
00:07:04,958 --> 00:07:07,918
Cold-blooded killers who are
more adored than movie stars.

66
00:07:08,958 --> 00:07:10,078
This has to stop.

67
00:07:22,916 --> 00:07:23,916
Well.
Where is he?

68
00:08:13,416 --> 00:08:16,626
This sure don't look like
no famous gunfighter's house.

69
00:08:16,708 --> 00:08:19,498
Well, most gunfighters end up
living in a pine box,

70
00:08:19,583 --> 00:08:22,503
but Hamer married well
and did just fine

71
00:08:22,583 --> 00:08:25,003
in private security
with the oil companies.

72
00:08:29,375 --> 00:08:31,495
Doesn't sound like he needs a job, sir.

73
00:08:33,166 --> 00:08:34,826
No, Luther, I suppose it doesn't.

74
00:08:41,875 --> 00:08:43,245
What in the good holy hell?

75
00:08:43,333 --> 00:08:44,923
- Porky!
- No.

76
00:08:47,416 --> 00:08:48,666
He ain't going to bite.

77
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:49,790
Frank.

78
00:08:50,833 --> 00:08:51,833
Lee.

79
00:08:51,875 --> 00:08:53,995
That's quite the watchdog
you've got there.

80
00:08:54,083 --> 00:08:54,923
He's a gift.

81
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,420
Widow in Alpine, too tough to eat,
wouldn't run off,

82
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,000
Glady hates him, but

83
00:08:59,833 --> 00:09:01,173
he's my friend not hers.

84
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:02,670
Go on.

85
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:03,830
Back in the house.

86
00:09:05,833 --> 00:09:06,833
Speaking of...

87
00:09:07,291 --> 00:09:08,451
How's Gault?
Speaking of what?

88
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:12,250
Friends.

89
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:14,580
Don't know. No idea where he is.

90
00:09:14,666 --> 00:09:15,666
Lubbock.

91
00:09:15,791 --> 00:09:16,881
Maney’s in Lubbock.

92
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:19,250
What bring's you?

93
00:09:19,833 --> 00:09:22,833
You may have heard
there was a prison break. Huntsville?

94
00:09:22,916 --> 00:09:25,536
Well, Ma Ferguson pardons
a hundred convicts a month.

95
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:29,960
They could've signed her a check,
saved themselves a lot of trouble.

96
00:09:30,916 --> 00:09:32,166
It was the Barrow Gang.

97
00:09:33,541 --> 00:09:34,751
Bonnie and Clyde.

98
00:09:34,833 --> 00:09:38,583
Nobody can put a net over them.
A thousand men in the field right now.

99
00:09:38,666 --> 00:09:39,996
Must be good.

100
00:09:40,833 --> 00:09:42,883
Got the drop on six peace officers so far.

101
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:43,998
What can I do for you?

102
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:47,500
Put them on the spot.

103
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,420
Well, don't...

104
00:09:51,208 --> 00:09:53,878
Don't mention that idea
inside the governor's mansion,

105
00:09:54,291 --> 00:09:55,881
not unless you want to be laughed at.

106
00:09:55,958 --> 00:09:57,958
I did and they did,
but she'll back me up on this.

107
00:09:59,625 --> 00:10:01,535
She gonna bring back the Rangers?

108
00:10:01,625 --> 00:10:02,625
No, never.

109
00:10:03,625 --> 00:10:05,465
What capacity then?
Special highway assignment.

110
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,750
Special highway assignment.

111
00:10:09,916 --> 00:10:10,916
Highwaymen?

112
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:16,630
What's it pay these days,
$150 a month?

113
00:10:16,708 --> 00:10:19,748
A hundred and thirty. It don't matter
what badge you got, Frank.

114
00:10:19,833 --> 00:10:21,673
We just need you to
put them out of business.

115
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:23,380
I thought you and Maney.

116
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:26,500
He's killed six law?

117
00:10:29,208 --> 00:10:31,788
You know you're gonna
have to put this man down.

118
00:10:31,875 --> 00:10:34,745
The Governor says you'll have full
authority to do whatever's necessary.

119
00:10:34,833 --> 00:10:35,833
Those are her words.

120
00:10:35,875 --> 00:10:37,245
I'm sorry, Lee, but I...

121
00:10:38,083 --> 00:10:39,083
I made a promise.

122
00:10:43,375 --> 00:10:45,285
Well, Lee Simmons, as I live and breathe.

123
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:47,375
Live in the same town, never see you.

124
00:10:47,958 --> 00:10:49,458
Hello, Gladys.

125
00:10:49,541 --> 00:10:51,251
You look lovely as always.

126
00:10:53,916 --> 00:10:55,246
What, are you feeding an army?

127
00:10:55,333 --> 00:10:57,293
- Yeah.
- Ladies Auxiliary.

128
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:01,790
Look at my new Henry Ford, Lee.

129
00:11:02,333 --> 00:11:04,043
Eighty-five horses, ain't she fun?

130
00:11:04,125 --> 00:11:05,915
Yes, ma'am, she certainly is.

131
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
What brings you out?

132
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:08,673
Oh, come by say hello.

133
00:11:10,208 --> 00:11:13,288
Lady Governor's offering me
130 dollars a month, Glady.

134
00:11:13,625 --> 00:11:14,625
To do what?

135
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,380
Hunt down Bonnie and Clyde.

136
00:11:23,625 --> 00:11:24,875
I'd best get back to my office.

137
00:11:24,958 --> 00:11:26,598
I think you'd best, Lee.

138
00:11:45,291 --> 00:11:46,631
Something you want to say?

139
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:48,920
I'm gonna repaint the kitchen.

140
00:11:53,416 --> 00:11:55,536
- That's what's on your mind, huh?
- Mm-hm.

141
00:11:55,875 --> 00:11:57,455
Yellow, I think.

142
00:13:01,833 --> 00:13:03,293
Dear Lord.

143
00:13:06,666 --> 00:13:09,416
<i>How about your fried egg? Is it too small?</i>

144
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:10,880
<i>No. It's big enough.</i>

145
00:13:10,958 --> 00:13:13,668
<i>It's a hen's egg.
But if it's too small</i>

146
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:16,170
<i>I'll get the rooster over here
and squeeze one out of him.</i>

147
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:20,590
<i>We interrupt this broadcast
to bring you a CBS news report.</i>

148
00:13:20,625 --> 00:13:22,285
Told you it looked like tornado weather.

149
00:13:22,375 --> 00:13:25,035
<i>Police in Reed Springs Missouri
report a harrowing shootout</i>

150
00:13:25,125 --> 00:13:28,375
<i>between gangsters Bonnie and Clyde
and officers of the law.</i>

151
00:13:28,875 --> 00:13:31,165
<i>The lawless lovers fired hundreds
of machine gun rounds</i>

152
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:32,670
<i>at the out-numbered officers.</i>

153
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:34,880
<i>No report yet
on the number of a fatalities.</i>

154
00:13:34,958 --> 00:13:37,788
<i>We now return to your
regular scheduled program.</i>

155
00:14:16,333 --> 00:14:17,883
You boys work for Ol' Salazar?

156
00:14:17,958 --> 00:14:20,708
Yes, sir. Mend fence,
cut Johnson grass,

157
00:14:22,791 --> 00:14:24,541
I think I've seen you before.

158
00:14:26,041 --> 00:14:28,251
He sent me out here
to give you boys a break.

159
00:14:31,875 --> 00:14:32,875
Come on, fellas.

160
00:14:43,416 --> 00:14:44,746
Which one of you has an arm?

161
00:14:44,833 --> 00:14:45,833
I do.

162
00:14:46,083 --> 00:14:47,463
You take them bottles out of there

163
00:14:47,541 --> 00:14:49,631
and see if you can get a couple
up here high for me.

164
00:14:49,708 --> 00:14:50,708
All right, and just...

165
00:14:51,291 --> 00:14:53,001
How about every one I hit,

166
00:14:53,833 --> 00:14:54,833
you get a nickel?

167
00:14:57,625 --> 00:14:58,625
Let her rip.

168
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:08,170
Yeah, let's do another one.

169
00:15:25,583 --> 00:15:26,583
For pity's sake.

170
00:15:30,583 --> 00:15:31,713
I'm a goddamn old man!

171
00:15:44,125 --> 00:15:45,125
All right.

172
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:52,250
Let her go.

173
00:15:55,541 --> 00:15:56,711
You got a piece of that.

174
00:15:58,750 --> 00:15:59,920
Yes, I did.
Just a piece.

175
00:16:06,333 --> 00:16:07,333
Go ahead.

176
00:16:07,916 --> 00:16:08,916
Take it, boys.

177
00:16:12,541 --> 00:16:14,211
It's for keeping your mouth shut.

178
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:16,500
Yes, sir.

179
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:19,000
You bring me that bag there?

180
00:16:20,833 --> 00:16:21,833
Hey, mister.

181
00:16:23,041 --> 00:16:24,791
Was you really Frank Hamer?

182
00:16:28,916 --> 00:16:29,956
Yep.

183
00:16:30,041 --> 00:16:31,921
You boys best get back to work, okay?

184
00:16:32,208 --> 00:16:33,208
Go on.

185
00:16:34,958 --> 00:16:36,878
The look on his face.

186
00:16:39,791 --> 00:16:41,001
Gladys is lovely,

187
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,250
but Captain Hamer is such a grump.

188
00:16:45,375 --> 00:16:48,825
- Mrs. Hamer, may I help you with anything?
- Keep Leanne from spiking that punch.

189
00:16:56,125 --> 00:16:57,125
Nice turn out.

190
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:00,750
Where's Porky?

191
00:17:01,208 --> 00:17:02,828
Locked in the spare bedroom.

192
00:17:05,291 --> 00:17:08,081
I don't suppose there's any chance
you want to take him with you?

193
00:17:12,833 --> 00:17:15,423
Don't pretend
you didn't just hide this from me.

194
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:24,380
I suppose you're going to
want to take my new Ford.

195
00:17:27,708 --> 00:17:29,788
I could tell you you're too old for this,

196
00:17:30,666 --> 00:17:32,126
or that it's not your affair,

197
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:35,880
or that you hadn't held a gun
in quite a while.

198
00:17:38,041 --> 00:17:40,381
I know that's all a waste of time,
so I won't.

199
00:17:40,458 --> 00:17:43,998
And I appreciate you
not telling me any of that.

200
00:17:47,541 --> 00:17:48,581
I'm sorry, Glady.

201
00:17:51,583 --> 00:17:52,583
Don't be.

202
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:55,750
I knew what you were when I married you.

203
00:18:01,041 --> 00:18:03,921
Oh, I packed sandwiches.
They're in the icebox.

204
00:18:09,041 --> 00:18:10,041
Thank you.

205
00:18:38,291 --> 00:18:39,291
Something else.

206
00:18:41,083 --> 00:18:42,923
If you're covering miles, keep oil in her.

207
00:18:43,833 --> 00:18:44,833
Yes, ma'am.

208
00:18:51,333 --> 00:18:53,083
Those two scare me, Frank.

209
00:18:59,583 --> 00:19:00,673
You tell me.

210
00:19:05,916 --> 00:19:07,036
I'll come back.

211
00:19:40,125 --> 00:19:41,495
Too good to come to my office?

212
00:19:44,125 --> 00:19:46,165
All the same I'd rather
keep this low-key.

213
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:48,583
Files.

214
00:19:49,458 --> 00:19:51,578
Here's your authorization right there.

215
00:19:51,666 --> 00:19:55,206
Your jurisdiction technically ends
at the state line on the border.

216
00:19:55,833 --> 00:19:56,833
Technically.

217
00:19:59,083 --> 00:20:01,083
- I guess this is my badge?
- Yep.

218
00:20:02,333 --> 00:20:03,543
You will keep me posted.

219
00:20:04,708 --> 00:20:05,828
Call me from the road?

220
00:20:06,375 --> 00:20:07,375
I'll call you when.

221
00:20:13,125 --> 00:20:14,455
Where you headed to first?

222
00:20:14,541 --> 00:20:16,921
Texarkana? El Paso? Dallas?

223
00:20:17,708 --> 00:20:18,708
Lubbock?

224
00:22:24,833 --> 00:22:26,253
Wake up, Pop-pop.

225
00:22:28,791 --> 00:22:29,791
Yeah.

226
00:22:30,291 --> 00:22:33,961
Mama says you should get up for breakfast
even if you don't have a job.

227
00:22:36,041 --> 00:22:36,921
Yeah.

228
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,210
Yeah, you're right.

229
00:22:45,791 --> 00:22:48,541
I've got to take Dan over to see
a man about some work.

230
00:22:48,625 --> 00:22:51,125
Can you make sure Nate
gets off to school on time?

231
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:56,380
Thinking about adding another bay
down at the garage.

232
00:22:57,916 --> 00:22:59,826
Pete said to call him in a few weeks.

233
00:23:00,375 --> 00:23:01,375
We're okay, Daddy.

234
00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:03,250
Really.

235
00:23:03,708 --> 00:23:05,378
No, I aim to pull my weight.

236
00:23:05,625 --> 00:23:06,955
Thank you.

237
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:08,670
Coming!

238
00:23:32,791 --> 00:23:34,131
Thanks, Pop-pop.

239
00:23:35,625 --> 00:23:37,665
That's a dang good biscuit, right there.

240
00:24:08,208 --> 00:24:10,708
You fix cars, so you could fix Daddy's?

241
00:24:12,416 --> 00:24:14,456
I could if he'd ever let me near it.

242
00:24:15,250 --> 00:24:17,420
But you used to be famous, right?

243
00:24:21,041 --> 00:24:22,041
Who told you that?

244
00:24:22,375 --> 00:24:23,455
Timmy Hess,

245
00:24:23,541 --> 00:24:25,501
he said you shot lots of crooks.

246
00:24:26,333 --> 00:24:28,793
Oh, yeah, what else did Timmy have to say?

247
00:24:28,916 --> 00:24:31,666
Nothing, just that
you might go to hell for it

248
00:24:36,958 --> 00:24:37,958
Go on.

249
00:25:29,291 --> 00:25:30,451
Morning.
Can I help you?

250
00:25:36,166 --> 00:25:39,036
I'd like to have a look at that Thompson
sub-machine gun.

251
00:25:45,625 --> 00:25:47,495
And the Colt monitor machine rifle,

252
00:25:48,166 --> 00:25:49,876
one up top there
with a custom pistol grip.

253
00:25:49,958 --> 00:25:50,958
Carter.

254
00:25:56,541 --> 00:25:57,881
Colt automatic pistol

255
00:25:59,125 --> 00:26:01,245
and 1917 Smith right behind it.

256
00:26:03,875 --> 00:26:06,415
And I want to see that B-A-R 30 aught six.

257
00:26:08,625 --> 00:26:11,575
And the aught three Springfield
with the glass up top there.

258
00:26:12,916 --> 00:26:15,456
That Remington
Model 11 Right Gun over there.

259
00:26:15,541 --> 00:26:17,541
You want the 28 inch, or the 20 inch?

260
00:26:17,625 --> 00:26:20,125
No sir. I want the short barrel.

261
00:26:20,708 --> 00:26:22,328
- Is that the 12?
- Yes, sir.

262
00:26:22,458 --> 00:26:25,378
Let me see that older Winchester
you got there, that 30-30.

263
00:26:29,416 --> 00:26:30,416
No, I'll take it.

264
00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:42,880
I'll need one gun that won't jam.

265
00:26:42,958 --> 00:26:45,378
Would you be wanting the
stick or the drum for the tommy?

266
00:26:45,458 --> 00:26:47,288
- How may in the stick?
- Twenty rounds.

267
00:26:47,375 --> 00:26:48,785
I'll take a dozen,

268
00:26:48,875 --> 00:26:50,035
and two of them drums.

269
00:26:51,875 --> 00:26:54,875
And a handful of them half-moon clips for
this Smith if you've got them.

270
00:26:54,958 --> 00:26:56,958
Do you have this in black
instead of nickel?

271
00:26:57,041 --> 00:26:58,081
Too damn shiny.

272
00:26:58,166 --> 00:26:59,786
I believe I do, sir.

273
00:27:00,333 --> 00:27:01,833
Alright then that'll...

274
00:27:02,458 --> 00:27:03,538
that'll do it.

275
00:27:05,166 --> 00:27:06,036
Which will do it?

276
00:27:06,125 --> 00:27:07,125
All of 'em.

277
00:27:08,416 --> 00:27:09,246
All of 'em?

278
00:27:09,333 --> 00:27:10,333
Yes, sir.

279
00:27:10,916 --> 00:27:13,666
Along with four cases of 45 lead,

280
00:27:14,958 --> 00:27:17,758
same for the 30 aught six and, say,
an even hundred each of the others.

281
00:27:20,208 --> 00:27:23,248
What all you going after that you need
all this firepower?

282
00:27:23,750 --> 00:27:25,170
If you don't mind me asking?

283
00:27:25,583 --> 00:27:27,503
No, sir. I don't mind at all.

284
00:28:07,333 --> 00:28:08,383
How'd you know it was me?

285
00:28:08,458 --> 00:28:10,998
Between the suit and the car,

286
00:28:11,083 --> 00:28:14,463
I thought you was the bank
'til I saw how poorly you drove.

287
00:28:18,833 --> 00:28:21,083
All them guns have anything
to do with that

288
00:28:21,958 --> 00:28:23,918
jackass and his girlfriend?

289
00:28:25,250 --> 00:28:26,790
It as bad is the headlines?

290
00:28:29,041 --> 00:28:29,881
Yeah.

291
00:28:29,958 --> 00:28:31,828
You came all the way up to the house.

292
00:28:32,625 --> 00:28:33,915
What changed your mind?

293
00:28:35,375 --> 00:28:38,205
I don't know, maybe seeing you
move like you're 85.

294
00:28:40,416 --> 00:28:41,746
Well, that's honest.

295
00:28:42,333 --> 00:28:44,333
Maybe a little too honest.

296
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:47,790
You could've asked me, let me decide.

297
00:28:47,875 --> 00:28:49,995
That would have been
the polite thing to do.

298
00:28:50,083 --> 00:28:52,963
Like you said, I changed my mind.
Besides, what would your...

299
00:28:53,916 --> 00:28:56,166
What would your daughter say
if you ran off?

300
00:28:57,541 --> 00:28:59,001
That a weight's been lifted.

301
00:29:00,041 --> 00:29:02,601
Well, you know how it goes,
I got to live the way they do, Gault.

302
00:29:02,666 --> 00:29:05,746
This case, that means sleeping in the car,
driving thousands of miles a week.

303
00:29:06,333 --> 00:29:08,463
I don't sleep much anyway.

304
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:12,540
When I do,
I most always dream about dead Mexicans.

305
00:29:14,375 --> 00:29:15,915
I think I'll look up Ledbetter.

306
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,000
He's dead.

307
00:29:20,791 --> 00:29:21,631
Or Cuthbert.

308
00:29:21,708 --> 00:29:25,828
Dead too. So is Alvarez
and if you go any further down the roster,

309
00:29:26,458 --> 00:29:28,248
I'm gonna be gravely offended.

310
00:29:28,333 --> 00:29:30,543
Dammit, Pancho, I'm above ground

311
00:29:31,458 --> 00:29:32,618
and ready to go.
Unless you...

312
00:29:36,250 --> 00:29:37,630
think I'm useless.

313
00:29:40,125 --> 00:29:41,165
You in good spirits?

314
00:29:44,125 --> 00:29:46,995
Pretty polite way
of asking if I'm drinking.

315
00:29:47,916 --> 00:29:48,916
Well, are you?

316
00:29:50,875 --> 00:29:52,075
I'm not.

317
00:29:52,875 --> 00:29:53,875
Not...

318
00:29:54,541 --> 00:29:55,541
holding.

319
00:29:57,333 --> 00:29:58,963
I could help with the driving.

320
00:29:59,041 --> 00:29:59,881
No.

321
00:29:59,958 --> 00:30:00,958
Or not.

322
00:30:06,666 --> 00:30:07,956
Ah, Judas Priest. Get in.

323
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,000
But no singing.

324
00:30:13,125 --> 00:30:17,415
<i>I raised taxes to pay for my
new law enforcement program</i>

325
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:20,000
and the last thing
this administration needs

326
00:30:20,083 --> 00:30:22,713
is for a couple ofhas-been <i>vaqueros</i>

327
00:30:22,791 --> 00:30:25,381
make that program look anything less than

328
00:30:25,458 --> 00:30:27,458
stellar during this economic crisis.

329
00:30:28,666 --> 00:30:30,986
Nod if your ears are working.
We'll get your gangsters, Ma.

330
00:30:31,833 --> 00:30:36,354
You don't, John, you're gonna be on guard duty at Easham
Prison Farm. Get Barrow off the damn road before they do.

331
00:30:42,333 --> 00:30:43,333
There she is.

332
00:30:43,375 --> 00:30:46,625
Why, here you all are.
I'm so glad to see you.

333
00:30:46,708 --> 00:30:48,748
Get your checkbooks out!

338
00:31:04,291 --> 00:31:05,421
Huh.

339
00:31:09,125 --> 00:31:10,875
Hey, you're getting tired.
I could always...

340
00:31:11,458 --> 00:31:12,458
dr...

341
00:31:14,291 --> 00:31:15,291
Just saying.

342
00:31:17,333 --> 00:31:21,793
Hey, uh, you think it was them
robbed that Armory up there?

343
00:31:23,291 --> 00:31:25,041
Huh. It's a good chance.

344
00:31:25,125 --> 00:31:27,535
Stole a car in Illinois.
Shot their way out of a roadblock.

345
00:31:27,625 --> 00:31:30,665
They've been following the same loops now
for three years.

346
00:31:30,750 --> 00:31:32,290
North to Kansas or Iowa,

347
00:31:32,375 --> 00:31:34,205
east to Illinois or Indiana,

348
00:31:34,291 --> 00:31:35,461
South to Arkansas.

349
00:31:36,416 --> 00:31:38,916
Then right back to Texas
to start over again.

350
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,380
We've got no jurisdiction
north of Red River.

351
00:31:42,083 --> 00:31:44,583
Maybe Hoover will take them up there.

352
00:31:44,666 --> 00:31:45,666
Carthage,

353
00:31:46,666 --> 00:31:47,536
Carthage.

354
00:31:47,625 --> 00:31:49,285
Carthage, Missouri

355
00:31:49,375 --> 00:31:54,665
Hell, I don’t remember a saddle being
as hard on a man’s ass as these seats.

356
00:32:02,541 --> 00:32:05,291
I never shot a girl before, Pancho.

357
00:32:08,125 --> 00:32:10,205
If we can take Clyde long range she'll...

358
00:32:11,833 --> 00:32:12,833
she'll surrender.

359
00:32:15,458 --> 00:32:17,668
We’re gonna shoot a man
without fair warning?

360
00:32:17,750 --> 00:32:19,170
Well, Lord knows he does.

361
00:32:19,250 --> 00:32:22,290
Yeah, well, Lord knows that’s what
separates us from him.

362
00:32:27,125 --> 00:32:28,325
Clarksdale, Mississippi.

363
00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:32,580
- Where next?
- Where they're headed.

364
00:32:35,083 --> 00:32:36,083
Home.

365
00:33:00,625 --> 00:33:02,075
West Dallas viaduct.

366
00:33:07,583 --> 00:33:08,793
The Devils back porch.

367
00:33:11,458 --> 00:33:14,208
And I thought my circumstances were bad.

368
00:33:17,583 --> 00:33:18,943
Let me see the file.
Bernal street.

369
00:33:25,083 --> 00:33:26,923
That's her mamma's house right there.

370
00:33:29,833 --> 00:33:31,543
They're real close to one another.

371
00:33:35,708 --> 00:33:37,708
Should be the Barrow's up on the corner.

372
00:33:38,250 --> 00:33:39,290
Eagle Ford Road.

373
00:33:40,041 --> 00:33:41,041
Mm.

374
00:33:56,708 --> 00:34:00,248
Says here the two families
talked on the telephone once a day

375
00:34:00,333 --> 00:34:01,503
until about a week ago.

376
00:34:01,625 --> 00:34:03,325
How the hell they know that?

377
00:34:05,416 --> 00:34:06,496
Federal wiretaps.

378
00:34:06,583 --> 00:34:07,633
Huh?

379
00:34:07,708 --> 00:34:09,998
G-Men can hook up to the party lines

380
00:34:10,833 --> 00:34:12,043
and record conversation.

381
00:34:12,125 --> 00:34:13,125
No.

382
00:34:15,166 --> 00:34:16,536
I'll be goddamned.

383
00:34:19,333 --> 00:34:20,713
Poncho.

384
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,420
What's this kid up to?

385
00:34:55,791 --> 00:34:57,211
Whoa, Poncho!

386
00:35:59,875 --> 00:36:01,375
Got to grab him quick.

387
00:36:30,458 --> 00:36:32,668
Were youchasing someone?

388
00:36:33,666 --> 00:36:35,786
Jim Thorpe, who are you?

389
00:36:35,875 --> 00:36:38,955
John Quinn, State Ferguson Agent.
This is Kendale, US Bureau of Investigation.

390
00:36:41,833 --> 00:36:44,253
We heard you were on
special assignment, Sir.

391
00:36:44,333 --> 00:36:45,833
Director Hoover sends his regards.

392
00:36:45,916 --> 00:36:48,666
He also sends a tip
by way of his contacts down south.

393
00:36:52,083 --> 00:36:53,083
What's going on?

394
00:36:53,458 --> 00:36:54,458
Ask him.
You okay?

395
00:36:58,125 --> 00:36:59,325
Thought you had my back.

396
00:37:00,083 --> 00:37:01,633
I would have been dead by now.

397
00:37:01,708 --> 00:37:04,628
You ran one more block we'd both be dead.

398
00:37:04,708 --> 00:37:08,038
Our information tells us that Barrow
might be hiding out down in Brownsville.

399
00:37:08,416 --> 00:37:09,626
You probably weren't aware,

400
00:37:09,708 --> 00:37:11,878
but this is
a highly-coordinated operation.

401
00:37:11,958 --> 00:37:14,788
That said, we're happy
for any help you two might give us.

402
00:37:16,250 --> 00:37:17,380
Down in Brownsville.

403
00:37:17,875 --> 00:37:19,325
You ever hunt wild horses, Quinn?

404
00:37:21,041 --> 00:37:22,041
What?

405
00:37:22,666 --> 00:37:23,666
God!

406
00:37:24,125 --> 00:37:25,165
Jeez!

407
00:37:25,625 --> 00:37:27,125
They hunt a big range.

408
00:37:28,083 --> 00:37:29,423
But they always come home.

409
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:31,630
Got a thousand person dragnet
in full operation.

410
00:37:31,708 --> 00:37:33,208
Roadblocks, air surveillance.

411
00:37:33,291 --> 00:37:36,052
Don’t think the Barrow Gang’s
gonna be coming back to the neighborhood

412
00:37:36,083 --> 00:37:36,923
any time soon.

413
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,330
No, sir. Outlaws and mustangs

414
00:37:40,083 --> 00:37:41,633
they always come home.

415
00:37:41,708 --> 00:37:43,578
Maybe you gentlemen
should go home too.

416
00:37:44,333 --> 00:37:45,583
This isn't Llano County.

417
00:37:45,666 --> 00:37:48,626
Be a shame if either of you
got hurt in retirement.

418
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,040
Be a shame if anybody got hurt.

419
00:37:58,208 --> 00:37:59,668
Sir, if I could,

420
00:37:59,750 --> 00:38:03,080
I think what detective Quinn means is
the Barrow gang just hit an armory.

421
00:38:03,166 --> 00:38:04,286
They're armed to kill.

422
00:38:08,541 --> 00:38:10,291
That's called a double-band system.

423
00:38:11,875 --> 00:38:14,125
Didn't have one
in your saddlebags I imagine.

424
00:38:14,208 --> 00:38:15,998
It's essential in a dragnet.

425
00:38:16,791 --> 00:38:18,961
Without it you might as well be
in Timbuktu.

426
00:38:19,666 --> 00:38:21,996
Or down in Brownsville,

427
00:38:23,125 --> 00:38:24,825
following your bullshit tip.

428
00:38:28,875 --> 00:38:30,415
I hear ya, understood.

429
00:38:35,916 --> 00:38:37,126
I've felt more welcome.

430
00:38:37,416 --> 00:38:38,416
Yeah.

431
00:38:40,416 --> 00:38:42,036
Maybe we ought to make some new friends.

432
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,540
Smoot Schmid, gentlemen.

433
00:38:45,625 --> 00:38:47,745
No need to introduce yourselves,
I know who you are,

434
00:38:47,833 --> 00:38:49,923
but I’d be honored
to shake your hands anyway.

435
00:38:50,583 --> 00:38:51,423
Hey.

436
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:55,330
Bob Alcorn there, and deputy
Ted Hinton holding up the Cola machine.

437
00:38:56,625 --> 00:38:57,625
Have a seat.
Damn.

438
00:39:01,083 --> 00:39:02,383
Hamer and Gault.

439
00:39:03,041 --> 00:39:05,381
You know how many times
I have told my grandson

440
00:39:05,458 --> 00:39:06,378
the Candelaria story?

441
00:39:06,458 --> 00:39:07,828
Every night before he goes to bed.

442
00:39:07,916 --> 00:39:09,076
That's what he wants to hear.

443
00:39:09,166 --> 00:39:10,286
And I mean every night.

444
00:39:11,208 --> 00:39:12,208
How's he sleep?

445
00:39:14,166 --> 00:39:16,376
Sheriff, we're involved
in the Barrow Manhunt...

446
00:39:17,250 --> 00:39:18,750
in a very private way.

447
00:39:18,833 --> 00:39:20,793
Well, it's not too private.
Word gets around.

448
00:39:20,875 --> 00:39:21,705
Yes, it does.

449
00:39:21,791 --> 00:39:23,791
We heard that Clyde
put a price on your head.

450
00:39:23,875 --> 00:39:27,665
And I keep my front door unlocked in case
that son-of-a-bitch ever wants to stop by.

451
00:39:31,625 --> 00:39:33,125
We're going to take him down.

452
00:39:34,750 --> 00:39:35,750
But we need your help.

453
00:39:36,333 --> 00:39:37,673
I would be honored.

454
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:40,750
We're looking for a confidence
in the neighborhood.

455
00:39:40,833 --> 00:39:43,503
Someone who knows the families

456
00:39:43,583 --> 00:39:45,083
and willing to talk.

457
00:39:46,041 --> 00:39:48,751
Well, how about a boy
that grew up with him?

458
00:39:48,833 --> 00:39:50,423
That worked with Clyde

459
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:52,210
known Bonnie ever since you was girl.

460
00:39:52,291 --> 00:39:56,751
A boy that can give you a positive
identification on them from first sighting

461
00:39:58,041 --> 00:40:01,131
He's got the mental range
of a windshield wiper.

462
00:40:01,208 --> 00:40:02,538
But he's reliable.

463
00:40:04,083 --> 00:40:05,333
Where can we find him?

464
00:40:05,916 --> 00:40:07,126
Holding up the Cola machine.

465
00:40:10,541 --> 00:40:13,251
Tough place to grow up.
Clyde was always mischief.

466
00:40:13,916 --> 00:40:16,126
You know, me and him
used to play cops and robbers.

467
00:40:16,208 --> 00:40:17,208
Let me guess.

468
00:40:17,250 --> 00:40:18,330
You was the cop.

469
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,250
All I ever wanted to be.

470
00:40:20,666 --> 00:40:22,666
That, or short stop
for the Cleveland Indians.

471
00:40:23,791 --> 00:40:25,041
And Bonnie? You, uh...

472
00:40:26,291 --> 00:40:27,381
you know Miss Parker?

473
00:40:27,458 --> 00:40:29,458
She grew up on the backside of the porch.

474
00:40:29,541 --> 00:40:30,881
Near Cement City.

475
00:40:30,958 --> 00:40:31,788
No daddy.

476
00:40:31,875 --> 00:40:33,325
Must be one hard lady.

477
00:40:33,416 --> 00:40:35,496
To the contrary, Sir. Little-bitty thing.

478
00:40:35,583 --> 00:40:38,583
Can't weigh but 90 pounds.
Smartest girl in school.

479
00:40:38,666 --> 00:40:41,416
She was in all the plays.
Won the spelling bees.

480
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:42,880
- Yeah.
- Wrote poetry.

481
00:40:42,958 --> 00:40:43,958
Yeah.

482
00:40:44,041 --> 00:40:46,501
I mean, attractive girl.
Taffy-colored hair

483
00:40:46,583 --> 00:40:49,293
Sounds like the short-stop was
maybe a little sweet on her?

484
00:40:49,375 --> 00:40:52,325
Any boy she ever waited on
at the Courthouse Cafe was sweet on her.

485
00:40:52,416 --> 00:40:54,626
How'd she fall in with
an outlaw like Barrow?

486
00:40:55,666 --> 00:40:56,666
Bored to tears.

487
00:40:57,125 --> 00:40:58,745
Along come Clyde in a fine car.

488
00:40:58,833 --> 00:41:00,633
By the time she found out
the car was stolen,

489
00:41:00,708 --> 00:41:01,708
she was already in love.

490
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:03,000
Ain't that romantic.

491
00:41:03,083 --> 00:41:07,383
I met my wife she was milking
a prize Devon at the Oklahoma State Fair.

492
00:41:08,250 --> 00:41:10,750
I can't imagine anybody writing a ballad

493
00:41:10,833 --> 00:41:11,923
about that encounter.

494
00:41:15,375 --> 00:41:18,165
You know, the files say they ran
two of your roadblocks.

495
00:41:19,791 --> 00:41:22,131
Well, they ran roadblocks in Oklahoma too.

496
00:41:22,541 --> 00:41:24,171
Kansas, New Mexico.

497
00:41:25,541 --> 00:41:27,461
Also said you had a clear shot at 'em.

498
00:41:30,416 --> 00:41:33,206
They say Clyde is some sort
of Fu-Manchu

499
00:41:33,541 --> 00:41:34,631
You know, can't be touched.

500
00:41:35,791 --> 00:41:38,581
Time magazine called him superhuman.
Y'all see that?

501
00:41:38,666 --> 00:41:40,786
Maybe you weren't able
to pull on her, Ted.

502
00:41:41,750 --> 00:41:42,750
Sir?

503
00:41:43,666 --> 00:41:45,786
Couldn't pull the trigger on a nice girl

504
00:41:45,875 --> 00:41:49,745
who used to serve you pecan pie
at the Courthouse Cafe.

505
00:41:50,541 --> 00:41:52,131
You're not able to do it.

506
00:41:52,958 --> 00:41:54,208
Well, I won't have to.

507
00:41:54,791 --> 00:41:56,461
I'm stationed here in West Dallas.

508
00:41:56,541 --> 00:41:58,711
Be a cold day in hell
before they show their faces

509
00:41:58,791 --> 00:41:59,711
on the back porch.

510
00:41:59,791 --> 00:42:01,251
Well, they're on their way, Ted.

511
00:42:01,333 --> 00:42:02,633
According to the wiretaps,

512
00:42:02,708 --> 00:42:05,918
Mrs. Parker is cooking red beans
and cabbage Easter Sunday.

513
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,540
Sir, I don't understand what you mean.

514
00:42:08,541 --> 00:42:11,211
Ted, you don't know what wiretaps are?

515
00:42:11,291 --> 00:42:13,291
Of course I know what wiretaps are!

516
00:42:13,375 --> 00:42:16,101
I just don’t understand what
red beans and cabbage have to do with it.

517
00:42:16,125 --> 00:42:17,495
Whenever Bonnie’s mama says

518
00:42:17,583 --> 00:42:20,133
that she has red beans and cabbage
on the stove, those dates,

519
00:42:20,208 --> 00:42:23,878
they match up to sightings or shoot-outs
in the general Dallas area.

520
00:42:23,958 --> 00:42:25,498
Red beans and cabbage. That's code.

521
00:42:26,083 --> 00:42:27,323
Means the kids are coming home.

522
00:42:30,416 --> 00:42:31,736
So, do I just ride with you boys?

523
00:42:31,791 --> 00:42:34,711
No, sir. We'll meet you in two days,
Easter Sunday.

524
00:42:34,791 --> 00:42:37,541
You meet us first thing in the morning,
a block from Eagle Ford road.

525
00:42:37,625 --> 00:42:39,915
I'll need you to make
the ID on Barrow and Parker.

526
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,000
I'm your man.

527
00:42:44,041 --> 00:42:45,361
They're afraid to shoot the girl.

528
00:42:46,625 --> 00:42:49,325
Gives Clyde the one second
he needs to get the drop and

529
00:42:50,250 --> 00:42:51,670
Toothpick there knows it.

530
00:42:56,416 --> 00:42:58,496
You've read the story
of Jesse James,

531
00:42:58,583 --> 00:43:00,043
and how he lived and died.

532
00:43:00,125 --> 00:43:02,205
Still in the need of something to read,

533
00:43:02,291 --> 00:43:04,581
here's the story of Bonnie and Clyde.

534
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:09,380
Used to be you had to have talent
to get published.

535
00:43:09,500 --> 00:43:11,960
Now you just have to shoot people.

536
00:43:21,041 --> 00:43:22,251
What is this place?

537
00:43:27,125 --> 00:43:29,495
They were sighted
a month or two ago camping...

538
00:43:30,375 --> 00:43:31,745
camping somewhere out here.

539
00:43:36,958 --> 00:43:38,378
Somebody's a damn good eye.

540
00:43:39,916 --> 00:43:42,166
That or they just walk right up to it.

541
00:43:53,625 --> 00:43:54,625
Look at it.

542
00:43:55,750 --> 00:43:58,990
Every shot right through the same hole.
When's the last time you fired that thing?

543
00:43:59,875 --> 00:44:02,745
You know what we're up against?
Hm? Any idea?

544
00:44:03,250 --> 00:44:05,460
Ain't nothing we ain't seen before,
Pancho.

545
00:44:05,541 --> 00:44:06,961
It was a shootout in Joplin.

546
00:44:07,958 --> 00:44:09,668
Over a thousand rounds were fired.

547
00:44:14,916 --> 00:44:16,036
What the hell is that?

548
00:44:17,666 --> 00:44:19,536
It's a Colt monitor machine rifle.

549
00:44:20,208 --> 00:44:23,078
Fires a twenty-round volley
at 3,000 feet per second.

550
00:44:23,166 --> 00:44:26,916
Our boy Clyde, he prefers
a Browning automatic 30 cal.

551
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:30,000
Pretty much the same gun
except now the little shit uses a...

552
00:44:31,291 --> 00:44:32,921
...welded under clip

553
00:44:33,500 --> 00:44:35,040
that can fire 40.

554
00:44:36,583 --> 00:44:38,083
Well, he ain't met old lucky.

555
00:44:38,166 --> 00:44:39,496
Shit. I ain’t that lucky.

556
00:44:55,125 --> 00:44:56,785
Hey, got one of them for me?

557
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:40,160
You folks all right?

558
00:46:14,166 --> 00:46:15,076
Happy Easter.

559
00:46:15,166 --> 00:46:16,166
Gotta pee.

560
00:46:17,833 --> 00:46:19,333
Yeah, might be something left

561
00:46:19,416 --> 00:46:21,536
after the 40 times you were up all night.

562
00:46:21,625 --> 00:46:25,245
Yeah, well, there's a place in heaven
for Gladys, the way you saw wood.

563
00:46:25,333 --> 00:46:26,463
When did you start that?

564
00:46:26,541 --> 00:46:27,541
Hurry up.

565
00:46:47,875 --> 00:46:50,165
<i>Why don't you go inside and wait there?</i>

566
00:47:09,375 --> 00:47:12,665
Barrows and Parkers stayed put
and no one's really seen Clyde around.

567
00:47:12,750 --> 00:47:14,210
Don't be surprised, Ted.

568
00:47:14,291 --> 00:47:16,381
You wouldn’t think Clyde would’ve noticed

569
00:47:16,458 --> 00:47:19,708
a little metal man leading a circus
through his old neighborhood?

570
00:47:21,916 --> 00:47:25,286
I hear there's red beans and cabbage
over at the Parker house.

571
00:47:25,375 --> 00:47:27,035
If you’re hungry, Captain Hamer.

572
00:47:27,125 --> 00:47:30,665
Maybe they rode in on their mustangs
and then rode back out again.

573
00:47:30,875 --> 00:47:32,495
Shots fired over near Grapevine.

574
00:47:32,583 --> 00:47:33,583
Officers down.

575
00:47:41,125 --> 00:47:42,415
I didn't say anything.

576
00:47:47,458 --> 00:47:48,458
Get in the car, Ted.

577
00:47:54,583 --> 00:47:57,253
How's the view from up there, Mr. Hoover?

578
00:47:57,833 --> 00:47:59,423
You high flying sissy.

579
00:48:02,375 --> 00:48:04,205
The car was parked there all morning.

580
00:48:05,833 --> 00:48:08,173
The two officers pulled up...

581
00:48:24,791 --> 00:48:26,831
- Hold on.
- You explain it to him, Ted.

582
00:48:36,875 --> 00:48:38,325
What do you make of that?

583
00:48:38,666 --> 00:48:40,456
Kid didn't get 'em into the gun.

584
00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:55,040
Get that to field office, too,
for finger print analysis.

585
00:48:55,125 --> 00:48:57,915
Careful where you step, cowboy.
This is an active crime scene.

586
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,080
Kiss my ass.

587
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,540
You were right, came back.

588
00:49:04,666 --> 00:49:05,746
Came right back to Dallas.

589
00:49:07,041 --> 00:49:07,961
Hm.

590
00:49:08,041 --> 00:49:09,041
Lettuce.

591
00:49:37,208 --> 00:49:38,668
Check the goddamn fence line.

592
00:49:42,666 --> 00:49:44,576
- What the hell you doing?
- You still got two.

593
00:49:54,708 --> 00:49:57,668
Third gun who fired; we think it's either
Joe Palmer or Raymond Hamilton.

594
00:49:58,166 --> 00:50:00,406
We'll run ballistics
and then maybe we'll know something.

595
00:50:01,208 --> 00:50:03,578
No, tracks are too big
and deep for Palmer.

596
00:50:03,666 --> 00:50:05,536
These are driver side.

597
00:50:12,875 --> 00:50:15,035
It may have to be Raymond
who shot that B-A-R then.

598
00:50:15,541 --> 00:50:16,791
Yeah, heavy.

599
00:50:16,875 --> 00:50:19,285
I reckon' Clyde used
a ten-gauge scattergun.

600
00:50:19,375 --> 00:50:21,205
Little girl used a sawn-off twenty.

601
00:50:27,416 --> 00:50:28,666
You see that?

602
00:50:31,958 --> 00:50:33,328
She drags her left leg.

603
00:50:34,416 --> 00:50:35,496
She gimped?

604
00:50:36,500 --> 00:50:38,920
Well, Clyde missed a detour
a month or so back.

605
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:40,750
Got her leg burned up in the wreck.

606
00:50:44,125 --> 00:50:46,415
Why does Bonnie have a pet rabbit?

607
00:50:47,166 --> 00:50:49,576
Maybe a present. For Bonnie's mama.

608
00:50:50,250 --> 00:50:52,460
Or Billie Mace.
You know, she's generous like that.

609
00:50:52,541 --> 00:50:54,881
Yeah, she can light up a rainy day,
can’t she, Ted?

610
00:50:54,958 --> 00:50:56,628
Little-bitty ain’t but 90 pounds.

611
00:50:56,708 --> 00:51:00,128
But she could shoot a patrolman
in the face, point blank, while he's down.

612
00:51:00,625 --> 00:51:02,995
- You can tell that from her tracks?
- See that heel scrape?

613
00:51:04,708 --> 00:51:05,708
He was on his side.

614
00:51:05,750 --> 00:51:08,750
She used her foot to push him over
so he could see what was about to happen.

615
00:51:08,791 --> 00:51:11,251
Those kids you grew up with
aren’t human any more.<i> </i>Look at me!

616
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:16,750
You remember that at the next road block.

617
00:51:21,041 --> 00:51:22,291
You okay, son?

618
00:51:22,375 --> 00:51:23,375
Yeah.

619
00:51:24,208 --> 00:51:25,418
We'll be in touch.

620
00:52:03,250 --> 00:52:04,290
Red River.

621
00:52:08,791 --> 00:52:09,791
State line.

622
00:52:15,583 --> 00:52:17,003
Oklahoma.

623
00:52:21,375 --> 00:52:23,245
- Just thought I’d point that out.
- Thank you.

624
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:26,580
It's open range now.

625
00:52:29,333 --> 00:52:31,503
<i>Well, where the hell are they?</i>

626
00:52:32,041 --> 00:52:33,251
I'm not sure.

627
00:52:33,333 --> 00:52:34,333
Why not?

628
00:52:35,083 --> 00:52:36,213
They work for you.

629
00:52:36,291 --> 00:52:39,211
They were in Dallas three days ago.
That's as much as I know.

630
00:52:39,291 --> 00:52:42,251
You promised to keep
Hamer on a short leash.

631
00:52:42,416 --> 00:52:43,416
Didn't you?

632
00:52:45,208 --> 00:52:47,918
If they make a fool of me,
there's going to be hell to pay.

633
00:52:49,041 --> 00:52:51,671
Do we understand each other,
Marshall Lee Simmons?

634
00:52:51,750 --> 00:52:52,750
Yes, ma'am.

635
00:52:53,291 --> 00:52:54,381
Good.

636
00:53:01,208 --> 00:53:02,208
Never seen 'em.

637
00:53:02,791 --> 00:53:03,791
Never seen 'em?

638
00:53:13,500 --> 00:53:14,500
Well,

639
00:53:15,250 --> 00:53:17,420
there hasn't been
another filling station for...

640
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:19,790
a hundred and sixty miles, you know.

641
00:53:23,125 --> 00:53:25,825
You never saw blue sedan with black tires.

642
00:53:25,916 --> 00:53:26,786
Nope.

643
00:53:26,875 --> 00:53:28,165
Two men and a woman,

644
00:53:28,333 --> 00:53:29,503
headed northbound?

645
00:53:30,458 --> 00:53:32,778
If it's Bonnie and Clyde you looking for,
I didn't see 'em.

646
00:53:34,833 --> 00:53:35,963
And if I did,

647
00:53:36,625 --> 00:53:37,915
all the luck to 'em.

648
00:53:39,083 --> 00:53:42,463
They only taking from the banks
that are taking from the poor folk,

649
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:44,040
like me.

650
00:53:58,708 --> 00:53:59,708
Well?

651
00:54:11,416 --> 00:54:12,536
Oh, Lord.

652
00:54:13,916 --> 00:54:16,826
Now what? I done told you all I'm gonna
tell you about Bonnie and Clyde.

653
00:54:21,041 --> 00:54:22,541
There's a peace officer

654
00:54:22,875 --> 00:54:24,875
died in the puddle of himself
back in Dallas.

655
00:54:32,916 --> 00:54:35,536
He was trying to get the shells
out of his pockets

656
00:54:36,833 --> 00:54:40,713
when his head was blown off. Easter Sunday morning.
His family will be on the breadline next week.

657
00:54:44,541 --> 00:54:45,541
All luck to ‘em?
Huh?

658
00:54:47,625 --> 00:54:48,625
All luck to ‘em?

659
00:54:50,916 --> 00:54:51,916
Poncho!

660
00:54:52,500 --> 00:54:54,880
- Is that really all you have to say, son?
- Poncho!

661
00:55:06,291 --> 00:55:08,041
They come through here yesterday.

662
00:55:08,833 --> 00:55:10,753
Asked me
where the nearest migrant camp was.

663
00:55:12,041 --> 00:55:13,541
Showed 'em on state map.

664
00:55:16,916 --> 00:55:18,166
Black tires,

665
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:20,080
blue sedan,

666
00:55:21,166 --> 00:55:22,886
the woman was carrying
a white bunny rabbit.

667
00:55:30,041 --> 00:55:33,041
Gas prices these days
got everybody a little riled.

668
00:56:11,625 --> 00:56:14,415
- What?
- Well, you’re the more sociable type.

669
00:56:14,500 --> 00:56:16,250
Meaning, I’m more full of shit.

670
00:56:21,416 --> 00:56:22,456
You boys hiring?

671
00:56:22,541 --> 00:56:24,421
I was gonna ask you the same.

672
00:56:24,958 --> 00:56:26,208
My partner and I,

673
00:56:26,291 --> 00:56:29,751
been on the road a long while.
Business went under in Fort Worth.

674
00:56:29,833 --> 00:56:31,753
Foreclosed. Damn banks.

675
00:56:31,833 --> 00:56:32,883
It says so in the Bible.

676
00:56:32,958 --> 00:56:34,288
The banks is the Devil.

677
00:56:35,083 --> 00:56:36,253
Say, my daughter

678
00:56:36,333 --> 00:56:37,833
and her boyfriend been moving

679
00:56:37,916 --> 00:56:40,286
camp to camp, looking for work.

680
00:56:40,375 --> 00:56:43,375
Would've come through in a new Ford sedan.

681
00:56:43,458 --> 00:56:45,418
Wouldn’t have happen
to see them, would ya?

682
00:56:45,500 --> 00:56:47,920
Two boys and a red-haired girl.

683
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,000
Tiny thing.

684
00:56:50,958 --> 00:56:52,578
They didn't come through here.

685
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:55,170
Oh, uh...

686
00:56:56,375 --> 00:56:57,745
Trade for some pump water?

687
00:56:58,500 --> 00:56:59,830
Much obliged, Mister.

688
00:56:59,916 --> 00:57:01,246
Good luck to you.

689
00:57:05,166 --> 00:57:06,456
They like me.

690
00:57:15,875 --> 00:57:18,495
Well, those are some first-rate mud pies
right there.

691
00:57:30,208 --> 00:57:31,998
I had a little girl like you.

692
00:57:32,750 --> 00:57:34,420
She's all growed up now.

693
00:57:35,041 --> 00:57:37,831
Got a baby of her own. A boy.

694
00:57:53,291 --> 00:57:54,501
Hey.

695
00:57:55,916 --> 00:57:57,456
Can I ask you something?

696
00:58:00,166 --> 00:58:02,286
Have you see these two come around here?

697
00:58:02,375 --> 00:58:04,415
Dressed up real nice.

698
00:58:04,500 --> 00:58:05,790
Huh?

699
00:58:06,708 --> 00:58:08,628
These are bad folks,

700
00:58:08,708 --> 00:58:10,078
they hurt other people.

701
00:58:10,208 --> 00:58:12,748
And if we don't find them,
they're going to hurt more people.

702
00:58:16,791 --> 00:58:18,211
Have you seen 'em here?

703
00:58:25,250 --> 00:58:26,420
Okay.

704
00:58:39,708 --> 00:58:40,708
Masterful.

705
00:58:41,291 --> 00:58:43,971
Well, why don't you just get out
and beat the hell out of everybody?

706
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:48,290
The lady gave it to me.

707
00:59:29,250 --> 00:59:30,420
Still warm?

708
00:59:34,666 --> 00:59:36,746
Butts over here, spread out.

709
00:59:44,833 --> 00:59:46,213
Hand-rolled Durham.

710
00:59:47,500 --> 00:59:49,170
She puffs Camels, right?

711
00:59:50,458 --> 00:59:51,458
Yeah.

712
00:59:52,250 --> 00:59:53,540
Clyde smokes Luckys.

713
00:59:55,375 --> 00:59:57,375
Always has that third man on watch.

714
00:59:58,875 --> 01:00:00,705
Usually near the car, away from ‘em.

715
01:00:02,541 --> 01:00:03,881
Which one is he?

716
01:00:04,125 --> 01:00:05,575
Well, three broke out,

717
01:00:05,666 --> 01:00:08,626
only one still with ‘em.

718
01:00:09,041 --> 01:00:12,081
Hamilton maybe, like you said.

719
01:00:12,291 --> 01:00:13,831
Well, maybe I was wrong.

720
01:00:15,375 --> 01:00:17,915
I’m sorry, I didn’t catch that.
You were what?

721
01:00:18,458 --> 01:00:19,788
Hamilton, he’s a…

722
01:00:20,625 --> 01:00:22,495
he's a front-runner, a peacock.

723
01:00:23,541 --> 01:00:25,291
Old Durham over there, he’s a follower.

724
01:00:25,375 --> 01:00:27,205
I suppose you got all that
from their file?

725
01:00:27,291 --> 01:00:30,461
Well, you track a wolf, you track a dog,
pretty soon you know the difference.

726
01:00:31,375 --> 01:00:33,955
Our third man over there,
that’s Clyde’s watch dog.

727
01:00:39,291 --> 01:00:41,501
You know, he may not drink but...

728
01:00:42,916 --> 01:00:43,916
She sure does.

729
01:00:44,416 --> 01:00:46,996
Little girl’s in serious pain.

730
01:00:47,291 --> 01:00:48,581
Laudanum.

731
01:00:54,291 --> 01:00:55,751
I love Clara Bow.

732
01:01:26,125 --> 01:01:28,125
Stuck in the...

733
01:01:41,291 --> 01:01:42,501
You folks need some help?

734
01:02:02,625 --> 01:02:04,035
Oh, Lord, help me.

735
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:06,210
Hi, sweetie.

736
01:02:36,708 --> 01:02:38,668
Kansas or pan handle?

737
01:02:43,166 --> 01:02:44,916
Check the file, see if any...

738
01:02:45,458 --> 01:02:48,128
of the escapees have family nearby.

739
01:02:58,500 --> 01:03:00,580
You know you got a radio in this thing?

740
01:03:00,666 --> 01:03:02,246
That ain’t factory.

741
01:03:02,458 --> 01:03:03,918
How much that set you back?

742
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:05,580
You’d have to ask Glady.

743
01:03:06,625 --> 01:03:08,875
Just an intrusion
on a man’s peace and quiet.

744
01:03:08,958 --> 01:03:10,668
Not that I've had any since Lubbock.

745
01:03:18,166 --> 01:03:20,076
Oh, yeah, that's a good'n.

746
01:03:28,791 --> 01:03:30,461
<i>This is an emergency alert.</i>

747
01:03:30,541 --> 01:03:33,251
<i>Police are not yet releasing any details,
but it has been reported</i>

748
01:03:33,333 --> 01:03:36,293
<i>that two officers have been shot
on a country road in a rural area</i>

749
01:03:36,375 --> 01:03:37,875
<i>just north of Commerce, Oklahoma.</i>

750
01:03:37,958 --> 01:03:39,118
How far is that?
Twenty miles.

751
01:04:03,500 --> 01:04:04,880
This don’t look promising.

752
01:04:09,166 --> 01:04:10,166
How are we today?

753
01:04:10,250 --> 01:04:13,170
Well it's never good when
a peace officer goes down in the line.

754
01:04:15,500 --> 01:04:17,250
We need to get through, Sir.

755
01:04:17,625 --> 01:04:18,455
Now.

756
01:04:18,541 --> 01:04:20,461
Only the Bureau has
multi-state jurisdiction.

757
01:04:20,541 --> 01:04:22,001
We need to stay the trail.

758
01:04:22,083 --> 01:04:24,083
This paper is worthless up here.

759
01:04:24,416 --> 01:04:26,246
So, unless you’re government agents,

760
01:04:26,333 --> 01:04:28,963
or Oklahoma police officers,
you’re not passing this roadblock.

761
01:04:30,125 --> 01:04:31,665
Turn this vehicle around.

762
01:04:53,041 --> 01:04:54,041
Goddammit.

763
01:04:57,041 --> 01:04:59,631
Hey! What the hell do you
think you're doing?

764
01:05:03,208 --> 01:05:04,748
They need dope for the girl.

765
01:05:06,625 --> 01:05:08,165
What’s the closest large town?

766
01:05:08,875 --> 01:05:10,745
You know what, Poncho?
Maybe I should drive.

767
01:05:13,500 --> 01:05:14,710
What town?

768
01:05:29,208 --> 01:05:30,208
What's that?

769
01:05:31,333 --> 01:05:32,503
Expense report.

770
01:05:35,541 --> 01:05:36,541
It's how much we...

771
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:40,250
How much we cost.

772
01:05:42,541 --> 01:05:44,751
How many bullets you got in you?

773
01:05:44,833 --> 01:05:46,133
Hell, I don't know.

774
01:05:48,916 --> 01:05:50,126
Sixteen, I think.

775
01:05:50,208 --> 01:05:53,208
You know, a man can't

776
01:05:53,291 --> 01:05:57,411
pass bullets through him like he can kidney stones.
Might be good to have a doctor look at you sometime.

777
01:06:02,708 --> 01:06:04,828
Might be good to have a doctor
look at you sometime.

778
01:06:05,250 --> 01:06:06,830
I ain't got no bullets in me.

779
01:06:07,291 --> 01:06:09,381
Because I was covering you.

780
01:06:15,125 --> 01:06:17,205
Clyde’s ahead of us on the road.

781
01:06:17,291 --> 01:06:19,171
How long we gonna just sit here?

782
01:06:19,250 --> 01:06:21,080
I don't know. You got a better idea?

783
01:06:22,291 --> 01:06:23,711
I don’t know if it’s better.

784
01:06:24,666 --> 01:06:26,126
The file said

785
01:06:26,208 --> 01:06:29,498
there was one convict
tried to make that Eastham escape,

786
01:06:29,583 --> 01:06:31,003
but missed the bus.
Wade McNabb.

787
01:06:33,041 --> 01:06:34,041
Why?

788
01:06:34,791 --> 01:06:37,881
If you were a free man, wouldn't you
try to meet up with your friends?

789
01:06:38,458 --> 01:06:41,128
McNabb's only in for firearms,

790
01:06:41,208 --> 01:06:42,208
he's not a killer.

791
01:06:42,291 --> 01:06:44,171
Lee Simmons could get him furloughed.

792
01:06:44,250 --> 01:06:46,290
Lady Governor would have to sign for it.

793
01:06:46,958 --> 01:06:50,878
I’d wager she’s not too happy
about us expanding our jurisdiction.

794
01:06:51,083 --> 01:06:52,083
Just saying.
Maney.

795
01:06:58,666 --> 01:06:59,876
Bonnie Parker.

796
01:07:02,375 --> 01:07:03,915
I've seen ten of them today.

797
01:07:05,958 --> 01:07:07,458
Yeah, it's the...

798
01:07:08,625 --> 01:07:10,785
- It's the fashion.
- All the rage.

799
01:07:18,125 --> 01:07:19,125
Where you going?

800
01:07:19,791 --> 01:07:21,001
Nature calls.

801
01:07:21,583 --> 01:07:23,083
Jiminy Christmas. Ya just went!

802
01:08:51,541 --> 01:08:52,631
Is that Bonnie?

803
01:09:06,750 --> 01:09:08,210
Get in the picture now.

804
01:09:16,541 --> 01:09:17,921
Bonnie and Clyde!

805
01:09:21,166 --> 01:09:22,496
It's them, around the corner.

806
01:09:23,166 --> 01:09:24,246
Grab a shotgun.

807
01:09:30,791 --> 01:09:33,171
I’m gonna back us out of here. Come on.

808
01:09:43,625 --> 01:09:45,825
They parked in the back.
One of ‘em went in.

809
01:09:46,583 --> 01:09:49,003
Wasn’t Ray Hamilton either.
It was Henry Methvin.

810
01:09:49,083 --> 01:09:52,043
- The third man in the jailbreak.
- I know, I saw him. You let him go?

811
01:09:53,791 --> 01:09:55,671
Well, I had my eye on Clyde.

812
01:09:55,750 --> 01:09:58,670
Clyde? You had your...
You had your eye on Clyde?

813
01:09:59,416 --> 01:10:00,246
You had a shot?

814
01:10:00,333 --> 01:10:01,773
Why didn’t you take him?

815
01:10:04,958 --> 01:10:06,248
Too many people.

816
01:10:06,333 --> 01:10:07,923
God damn fan club.

817
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:35,830
Right there! Right there!

818
01:11:49,750 --> 01:11:51,000
I can’t see ‘em!

819
01:12:43,750 --> 01:12:44,750
Yeah.

820
01:12:51,875 --> 01:12:53,075
Damn.

821
01:13:17,166 --> 01:13:19,496
They stopped
for a nice breakfast this morning.

822
01:13:20,833 --> 01:13:22,833
French toast and coffee.

823
01:13:23,625 --> 01:13:27,125
Clyde ordered himself a soft boiled egg
off the a la carte menu.

824
01:13:28,875 --> 01:13:30,875
Cute little diner in Amarillo.

825
01:13:31,250 --> 01:13:33,710
- Amarillo?
- Yeah.

826
01:13:36,041 --> 01:13:37,961
Clyde drove 400 miles last night?

827
01:13:38,041 --> 01:13:39,791
Four hundred and fifty.

828
01:13:43,083 --> 01:13:44,503
Did you ever think, maybe...

829
01:13:46,416 --> 01:13:48,626
Maybe it ain't in us no more?

830
01:14:28,875 --> 01:14:29,995
Oh.

831
01:14:32,625 --> 01:14:35,955
He got through a thousand-man dragnet
to deliver a bunny to mama.

832
01:14:41,083 --> 01:14:42,253
What do we do now?

833
01:14:42,750 --> 01:14:44,540
I just had the one idea.

834
01:14:52,500 --> 01:14:53,790
Pancho!

835
01:15:40,833 --> 01:15:43,043
CLYDE SENDS LETTER TO HENRY FORD
"YOU MAKE A DANDY CAR"

836
01:15:51,083 --> 01:15:52,083
Thank you, sir.

837
01:15:58,750 --> 01:16:01,460
They tell me
you're from the highway department, but...

838
01:16:03,166 --> 01:16:04,496
I know who you really are.

839
01:16:08,666 --> 01:16:10,126
I know a killer when I see one.

840
01:16:10,208 --> 01:16:12,038
I’m sure you would, Mr. Barrow.

841
01:16:15,708 --> 01:16:17,498
Look, mister.

842
01:16:21,458 --> 01:16:23,748
I know y'all going to have to
kill my boy.

843
01:16:25,541 --> 01:16:26,791
It ain't your fault.

844
01:16:26,875 --> 01:16:29,915
He's gone past the point of redemption.

845
01:16:31,875 --> 01:16:33,155
There's something I want to say.

846
01:16:36,458 --> 01:16:37,458
Here.

847
01:16:39,458 --> 01:16:41,078
He wasn't born that way.

848
01:16:42,750 --> 01:16:45,500
He wasn’t born with no dark soul.

849
01:16:47,875 --> 01:16:49,125
My little Huck Finn.

850
01:16:50,208 --> 01:16:52,918
That’s what me and Cumie called him.

851
01:16:53,791 --> 01:16:55,171
He loved bicycles.

852
01:16:57,500 --> 01:16:59,330
What he really wanted to be
was a musician.

853
01:17:00,333 --> 01:17:04,793
I mean, sure, he liked to dress fine
and get the girls and all like that but...

854
01:17:05,583 --> 01:17:07,543
You know, he wasn't a bad boy.
I had high hopes.

855
01:17:10,916 --> 01:17:12,916
People don't always know who they are...

856
01:17:14,083 --> 01:17:15,253
...until it's too late.

857
01:17:15,333 --> 01:17:18,383
Oh, you mean one turn on the trail, huh?

858
01:17:18,458 --> 01:17:19,498
That what you mean?

859
01:17:20,833 --> 01:17:22,293
He stole a chicken.

860
01:17:23,541 --> 01:17:25,961
He stole a goddamned chicken, Mister.

861
01:17:26,041 --> 01:17:30,211
and the law took him for a bad seed
and from that day forward,

862
01:17:30,541 --> 01:17:32,501
he was dogged by the law.

863
01:17:32,583 --> 01:17:34,423
- Dogged him?
- Yes, sir!

864
01:17:36,041 --> 01:17:37,381
Dogged him or watched him?

865
01:17:37,458 --> 01:17:39,998
I guess it’s all the same to you.
You’re a cop.

866
01:17:40,583 --> 01:17:41,583
Yes, I am.

867
01:17:51,833 --> 01:17:53,003
Growing up all I ever…

868
01:17:54,541 --> 01:17:56,501
all I ever wanted to be was a preacher.

869
01:17:57,125 --> 01:17:58,125
Preacher?

870
01:17:59,125 --> 01:18:01,245
You expect me to believe that?

871
01:18:03,500 --> 01:18:05,210
I was saving up for the seminary.

872
01:18:06,625 --> 01:18:08,665
Working for a sharecropper in San Saba.

873
01:18:10,750 --> 01:18:13,250
Word got out
that I was pretty handy with a pistol.

874
01:18:14,041 --> 01:18:15,671
The owner, McSwain,

875
01:18:15,750 --> 01:18:18,580
called me up to the porch one day
and wanted to know if I

876
01:18:18,875 --> 01:18:21,035
wanted to make $150.

877
01:18:22,125 --> 01:18:25,035
I laughed and said,
“Who do I have to kill?”

878
01:18:28,125 --> 01:18:29,625
And he kept staring at me.

879
01:18:30,750 --> 01:18:31,750
That's when I knew

880
01:18:33,125 --> 01:18:34,875
he wasn't talking about killing

881
01:18:35,458 --> 01:18:37,038
a coyote or a polecat.

882
01:18:39,833 --> 01:18:42,673
He was talking about
his business partner he wanted dead.

883
01:18:45,333 --> 01:18:47,373
I told him I was going to
tell his business partner.

884
01:18:49,541 --> 01:18:50,881
That wasn't too smart.

885
01:18:50,958 --> 01:18:52,288
Well, I was 16!

886
01:18:53,833 --> 01:18:54,923
Like I said, I was

887
01:18:56,041 --> 01:18:57,501
saving up for the seminary.

888
01:18:59,458 --> 01:19:00,708
Couple weeks later, he...

889
01:19:01,541 --> 01:19:03,791
asked me to put some groceries
in his house.

890
01:19:05,041 --> 01:19:08,001
Before I could go in,
he pulled a scatter gun.

891
01:19:09,916 --> 01:19:11,286
Shot me in my head,

892
01:19:12,458 --> 01:19:13,538
my back,

893
01:19:14,750 --> 01:19:15,750
my leg.

894
01:19:17,416 --> 01:19:21,416
For whatever reason I still don't know,
he stepped right over me and went inside.

895
01:19:22,125 --> 01:19:23,125
Maybe to reload.

896
01:19:23,250 --> 01:19:24,380
I don't know, but I...

897
01:19:25,333 --> 01:19:29,133
I scrambled away.
Hid in an irrigation ditch.

898
01:19:29,583 --> 01:19:32,293
I would’ve died there
except for a colored field hand.

899
01:19:33,250 --> 01:19:34,290
Came along found me.

900
01:19:35,541 --> 01:19:36,541
Carried me home.

901
01:19:38,791 --> 01:19:40,631
My momma took care of me all summer.

902
01:19:41,833 --> 01:19:42,833
Come fall, I...

903
01:19:43,833 --> 01:19:45,503
I packed up for the seminary.

904
01:19:47,500 --> 01:19:49,170
At least that's what I told them.

905
01:19:50,833 --> 01:19:53,963
And on my way out of town,
I rode over to McSwain’s.

906
01:19:54,916 --> 01:19:56,786
Rang the yard bell. He come out.

907
01:19:57,583 --> 01:20:01,083
And I shot that son-of-a-bitch dead
right there on that same porch

908
01:20:02,916 --> 01:20:04,246
and there went my calling.

909
01:20:08,541 --> 01:20:10,881
Turned out
McSwain was a wanted man himself,

910
01:20:12,333 --> 01:20:13,503
and I became the law.

911
01:20:14,750 --> 01:20:16,330
One turn on the trail, huh?

912
01:20:16,416 --> 01:20:17,416
Yes, sir.

913
01:20:17,875 --> 01:20:18,875
One turn.

914
01:20:20,083 --> 01:20:21,753
How come you telling me all this?

915
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:27,960
You ever think maybe there was
something in Clyde

916
01:20:28,916 --> 01:20:31,246
made him steal that chicken
in the first place?

917
01:20:33,958 --> 01:20:35,078
Maybe he was hungry.

918
01:20:38,416 --> 01:20:39,956
Maybe we were all hungry.

919
01:20:45,083 --> 01:20:46,083
I won't argue that.

920
01:20:47,708 --> 01:20:49,168
He ain't going to surrender.

921
01:20:51,833 --> 01:20:53,673
You just going to hang him anyhow.

922
01:20:54,750 --> 01:20:57,960
Hmm. He'd rather be brought down
on the run.

923
01:21:00,125 --> 01:21:01,955
You know, your boy may not have been

924
01:21:02,750 --> 01:21:06,210
born with a dark soul, but he has one now.

925
01:21:06,750 --> 01:21:08,250
You're not hearing me, mister.

926
01:21:10,250 --> 01:21:11,710
I'm trying to say something.

927
01:21:12,125 --> 01:21:13,955
It ain't easy for me to say.

928
01:21:15,541 --> 01:21:19,211
I know there's only one way
that this thing is ever going to end.

929
01:21:20,833 --> 01:21:22,633
And I'm asking you, please

930
01:21:24,916 --> 01:21:26,916
just end it now, damn it.

931
01:21:28,333 --> 01:21:29,713
End it for my family.

932
01:21:47,750 --> 01:21:49,130
You call Lee Simmons.

933
01:21:50,083 --> 01:21:52,003
Get him to furlough Wade McNabb.

934
01:21:54,125 --> 01:21:55,285
What a fine idea.

935
01:22:26,125 --> 01:22:29,785
I couldn't believe it when
Billy Mays said he was letting you out.

936
01:22:30,250 --> 01:22:33,830
Sixty days. And if I get a job
and I do good behavior in that time,

937
01:22:33,916 --> 01:22:35,206
it could be full parole.

938
01:22:35,625 --> 01:22:38,025
But it ain’t good behavior
I got on my mind tonight, sweetie.

939
01:22:39,416 --> 01:22:40,626
My kind of place.

940
01:22:46,416 --> 01:22:47,496
How are you, darling?

941
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:54,210
So, is it true?
You really know Clyde Barrow?

942
01:22:54,291 --> 01:22:56,501
I knew his brother Buck, too,
before they shot him dead.

943
01:22:56,583 --> 01:22:57,783
What are we gonna do with you?

944
01:22:57,833 --> 01:22:59,833
- I can think of a few things, darling.
- Oh, yeah?

945
01:23:03,250 --> 01:23:04,750
Good to be off the farm, Wade?

946
01:23:14,833 --> 01:23:16,463
They wouldn't tell me your name.

947
01:23:16,666 --> 01:23:17,666
Don't need it.

948
01:23:18,250 --> 01:23:19,250
I dig.

949
01:23:22,125 --> 01:23:24,825
Say, you owe me a do-over, slick.

950
01:23:27,166 --> 01:23:28,166
Or not.

951
01:23:29,583 --> 01:23:31,783
Where's a water closet?
So, what do y'all need me to do?

952
01:24:09,125 --> 01:24:12,325
Say, you bringing the cattle market, dad?

953
01:24:15,916 --> 01:24:17,286
I swear, big man,

954
01:24:17,375 --> 01:24:19,375
they’re plannin’ to skin out for Mexico.

955
01:24:19,541 --> 01:24:20,541
That is the word.

956
01:24:20,833 --> 01:24:22,043
What do you know, Joe?

957
01:24:24,416 --> 01:24:27,746
Son, suppose you cut
the junior gangster act and get serious.

958
01:24:27,833 --> 01:24:29,673
Otherwise, there's
nothing you can do for me.

959
01:24:29,750 --> 01:24:32,750
I'll have Lee Simmons give you a ride
back to the farm tonight.

960
01:24:33,208 --> 01:24:34,078
Yes, sir.

961
01:24:34,166 --> 01:24:36,166
Let me tell you somethin’, Mister.

962
01:24:37,916 --> 01:24:40,666
You come to the wrong place
to dog Wade boy.

963
01:24:40,750 --> 01:24:41,750
That's right, old man.

964
01:24:42,250 --> 01:24:45,170
You see, Wade Boy runs with Clyde

965
01:24:46,416 --> 01:24:48,916
and around here, Clyde is king.

966
01:24:50,666 --> 01:24:52,206
Watch those fancy shoes.

967
01:24:58,916 --> 01:25:02,456
It’s a real mess, you get it point blank,
but I’m happy to do it for you.

968
01:25:02,541 --> 01:25:04,291
A lot of nerve you got tryin’ to...

969
01:25:05,291 --> 01:25:07,961
...rob a fella while he’s
havin’ himself a pleasant relief.

970
01:25:08,458 --> 01:25:09,628
Get yourselves in that stall.

971
01:25:13,541 --> 01:25:17,081
Stay in there till I come back
and tell you different.

972
01:25:21,166 --> 01:25:22,626
Clyde might be king,

973
01:25:23,041 --> 01:25:24,791
but I'm a Texas Ranger, you little shit.

974
01:25:28,166 --> 01:25:30,076
Billie Mace is set to fix Bonnie’s hair.

975
01:25:30,416 --> 01:25:31,826
- When?
- Tomorrow.

976
01:25:32,125 --> 01:25:33,125
Dinnertime.

977
01:25:33,416 --> 01:25:36,076
Might look like two girls.
Clyde sometimes wears a ladies wig.

978
01:25:38,375 --> 01:25:40,455
He done got y'all chasing
your own tails, don’t he?

979
01:25:40,541 --> 01:25:42,541
Son, if you're telling the truth,

980
01:25:43,041 --> 01:25:46,291
you’ll finish out your term
in a nice, civilized federal pen.

981
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:51,420
But you do wrong by me, you’ll be
back on the farm, breakin’ rocks,

982
01:25:51,958 --> 01:25:53,708
and getting your teeth stove in.

983
01:25:54,958 --> 01:25:56,128
What took you so long?

984
01:25:57,333 --> 01:25:58,923
There’s a fella in the toilet.

985
01:26:16,833 --> 01:26:18,043
Are you Billie Mace?

986
01:26:24,125 --> 01:26:25,285
Must be Billy Mace.

987
01:26:57,041 --> 01:26:58,171
Hey, grand-dad.

988
01:26:59,083 --> 01:27:00,133
Wanna race again?

989
01:27:13,458 --> 01:27:15,788
Didn’t your mama teach you
to tie your shoes?

990
01:27:19,541 --> 01:27:20,541
Uh-uh.

991
01:27:31,750 --> 01:27:33,830
- We gonna see each other again?
- No, sir.

992
01:27:38,416 --> 01:27:39,576
Git!

993
01:27:42,791 --> 01:27:44,751
"Git." Down right poetic.

994
01:27:48,958 --> 01:27:51,378
Uh, "headed for greener pastures,

995
01:27:51,916 --> 01:27:53,246
see you next time around."

996
01:27:59,958 --> 01:28:01,078
McNabb warned them.

997
01:28:38,833 --> 01:28:41,003
McNabb! Open up the goddamn door!

998
01:29:26,541 --> 01:29:28,001
Goddamn animals.

999
01:29:57,125 --> 01:29:58,665
Did I get that boy killed?

1000
01:29:59,541 --> 01:30:00,541
No, sir.

1001
01:30:01,416 --> 01:30:02,416
You did not.

1002
01:30:05,833 --> 01:30:08,883
He would have been out
in nine months on his own.

1003
01:30:11,750 --> 01:30:12,750
Fella did not

1004
01:30:13,916 --> 01:30:14,916
have to die.

1005
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:18,250
Maybe so, but that fella
made his own choices.

1006
01:30:22,541 --> 01:30:23,541
See, Frank,

1007
01:30:24,833 --> 01:30:27,793
that’s the difference
right there between you and me.

1008
01:30:29,916 --> 01:30:32,246
You could always hide

1009
01:30:32,958 --> 01:30:36,288
behind some notion
of right and wrong. Me,

1010
01:30:37,625 --> 01:30:40,205
I never particularly liked the weight

1011
01:30:41,166 --> 01:30:45,286
of the deciding
who gets to live and who doesn’t.

1012
01:30:46,333 --> 01:30:48,253
There’s differences between us, Maney.

1013
01:30:49,833 --> 01:30:52,043
But hiding behind something
ain’t one of ‘em.

1014
01:30:54,416 --> 01:30:55,786
You know, counting McNabb,

1015
01:30:56,375 --> 01:30:57,535
they’ve killed 13

1016
01:30:58,041 --> 01:30:59,501
and people call ‘em heroes.

1017
01:31:00,750 --> 01:31:02,790
- Who cares what they call...
- I care!

1018
01:31:04,375 --> 01:31:05,875
People idolize them.

1019
01:31:07,125 --> 01:31:08,535
We need to end this.

1020
01:31:10,833 --> 01:31:12,173
It's never easy,

1021
01:31:13,083 --> 01:31:14,133
it's never pretty.

1022
01:31:15,416 --> 01:31:16,666
But there's always blood

1023
01:31:17,333 --> 01:31:19,083
at the end of the road, you know that.

1024
01:31:19,583 --> 01:31:21,083
You know that the same as me.

1025
01:31:25,041 --> 01:31:26,131
I seen a lot a blood,

1026
01:31:27,875 --> 01:31:28,875
but it ain’t theirs.

1027
01:31:28,958 --> 01:31:30,628
Goddammit, Maney, why the hell…

1028
01:31:32,541 --> 01:31:34,001
Why the hell you even come?

1029
01:32:18,166 --> 01:32:19,286
I had to come.

1030
01:32:22,916 --> 01:32:25,786
Though I don't exactly know why.

1031
01:32:31,750 --> 01:32:34,750
It's going to look like
we set McNabb up to be killed.

1032
01:32:37,958 --> 01:32:39,078
Ma finds out,

1033
01:32:41,916 --> 01:32:44,376
I don't think
I can protect you or myself.

1034
01:32:46,166 --> 01:32:49,076
<i>You need to come back to Austin
so we can sort this out.</i>

1035
01:32:49,166 --> 01:32:50,166
I understand, Lee.

1036
01:33:20,458 --> 01:33:22,578
If you're ready to go home,
I'll drive you.

1037
01:33:24,291 --> 01:33:25,791
Take me to greener pastures.

1038
01:33:27,625 --> 01:33:29,785
I’ll just get a bottle and set there

1039
01:33:30,583 --> 01:33:32,213
and wait for Clyde to show up.

1040
01:33:34,666 --> 01:33:37,076
Does that mean anything, you think?
Headed for...

1041
01:33:37,791 --> 01:33:38,961
greener pastures.

1042
01:33:40,208 --> 01:33:42,288
Is he headed for a state
he hasn't hit yet?

1043
01:33:42,375 --> 01:33:43,375
Could be.

1044
01:33:44,916 --> 01:33:46,666
What states have warrants for him?

1045
01:33:47,125 --> 01:33:47,955
Mm.

1046
01:33:48,041 --> 01:33:49,381
No, better still.

1047
01:33:50,375 --> 01:33:51,455
What states don't.

1048
01:33:53,333 --> 01:33:54,583
New Mexico,

1049
01:33:55,208 --> 01:33:56,248
uh,

1050
01:33:56,333 --> 01:33:57,633
Colorado,

1051
01:33:58,375 --> 01:33:59,455
Louisiana.

1052
01:34:00,291 --> 01:34:02,001
Outlaws always go home.

1053
01:34:03,625 --> 01:34:05,825
Maybe we just been looking
at the wrong home.

1054
01:34:08,833 --> 01:34:10,253
Methvin, where’s he from?

1055
01:34:11,875 --> 01:34:12,785
Kansas.

1056
01:34:12,875 --> 01:34:14,205
He still have family there?

1057
01:34:15,625 --> 01:34:17,375
No, his dad

1058
01:34:18,625 --> 01:34:20,745
lives in Bienville Parish.

1059
01:34:20,833 --> 01:34:22,083
East of Shreveport.

1060
01:34:46,083 --> 01:34:49,673
Owner lets folk squat
in exchange for labor.

1061
01:34:50,625 --> 01:34:52,325
Henry’s daddy hauls wood for ‘em.

1062
01:34:57,000 --> 01:34:58,500
That's his truck right there.

1063
01:35:03,041 --> 01:35:04,171
Ivy Methvin.

1064
01:39:17,333 --> 01:39:18,503
They're playing house.

1065
01:39:19,083 --> 01:39:20,503
She’s a little bitty thing.

1066
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:29,170
So's he.

1067
01:39:31,166 --> 01:39:32,246
Huh.

1068
01:40:03,750 --> 01:40:04,750
You all right?

1069
01:40:06,791 --> 01:40:07,791
Yeah.

1070
01:40:09,250 --> 01:40:10,250
Fix the room back.

1071
01:40:32,750 --> 01:40:34,380
Probably best they weren't home.

1072
01:40:34,458 --> 01:40:37,078
We got no jurisdiction
to arrest in these parts.

1073
01:40:37,166 --> 01:40:39,326
Now, we weren’t there
to arrest them, Maney.

1074
01:40:40,125 --> 01:40:43,375
Well, then I suggest we bring in
a local sheriff next time.

1075
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:46,000
Okay, what if he's in on the hand?

1076
01:40:47,500 --> 01:40:50,460
A corrupt sheriff down this way
isn’t exactly remarkable.

1077
01:40:50,541 --> 01:40:52,081
One way to find out.

1078
01:40:56,666 --> 01:40:59,076
- You said you seen Clyde.
- Yes, sir.

1079
01:40:59,166 --> 01:41:01,166
Where? North highway?

1080
01:41:01,333 --> 01:41:03,923
- Most recently two miles from-<i>-</i>
- How you know it him?

1081
01:41:06,125 --> 01:41:08,825
My name is Flavius Kern.

1082
01:41:08,916 --> 01:41:12,246
I am the Barrow family parson. May I?

1083
01:41:12,708 --> 01:41:13,748
Thank you.

1084
01:41:14,541 --> 01:41:18,291
Now, nobody knows I’m here
and you never saw me.

1085
01:41:19,291 --> 01:41:24,001
But, the family is grateful to you

1086
01:41:24,125 --> 01:41:29,245
because the kids,
they’re good kids. They're...

1087
01:41:29,666 --> 01:41:32,076
They got in a little over their heads,

1088
01:41:32,166 --> 01:41:35,166
but word is there’s some heat on ‘em
down here

1089
01:41:35,250 --> 01:41:38,710
and I know you never saw 'em,
and you never heard they was

1090
01:41:38,791 --> 01:41:41,381
in your parish,
and we’d like to keep it that way.

1091
01:41:41,458 --> 01:41:46,538
Clyde will try to show
his appreciation to you, but the family

1092
01:41:49,250 --> 01:41:50,960
would like to show theirs.

1093
01:41:56,833 --> 01:42:00,423
Call it a contribution
to the Parish church.

1094
01:42:01,250 --> 01:42:03,460
Now, I won’t take up
any more of your time.

1095
01:42:10,291 --> 01:42:13,171
Your boy use a shotgun on that gator or...

1096
01:42:13,250 --> 01:42:15,790
No, we use a gig, like this here.

1097
01:42:15,875 --> 01:42:19,535
Listen to me, <i>papere.</i> I see these dogs
in Bienville, I shoot ‘em dead.

1098
01:42:20,708 --> 01:42:24,078
Take your bribe and go home,
or I shoot your ass, too.

1099
01:42:24,166 --> 01:42:25,666
We’re not crooks down here.

1100
01:42:25,750 --> 01:42:28,460
Well, then, you are just the gentleman
we're looking for.

1101
01:42:29,958 --> 01:42:30,958
<i>Timber!</i>

1102
01:42:35,708 --> 01:42:36,708
Mr. Ivy.

1103
01:42:37,125 --> 01:42:41,125
Some men over there lookin’ for somebody
to cut and haul wood.

1104
01:42:43,166 --> 01:42:44,286
Say they’ll pay fair.

1105
01:42:45,041 --> 01:42:48,631
You need some more hands,
me and my boy, we needs the work.

1106
01:42:50,375 --> 01:42:51,375
Work right here.

1107
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:53,000
Get to it.

1108
01:42:53,666 --> 01:42:54,666
Yes, sir.

1109
01:43:22,458 --> 01:43:23,578
What the hell is this?

1110
01:43:24,541 --> 01:43:27,291
I’m Sheriff Jordan.
This is my deputy, Mr. Oakley.

1111
01:43:27,375 --> 01:43:28,455
Well, who are you fellas?

1112
01:43:28,541 --> 01:43:29,751
Doesn’t concern you.

1113
01:43:31,250 --> 01:43:34,920
All you need to know is Bonnie and Clyde
are going down hard, Mr. Methvin.

1114
01:43:35,833 --> 01:43:37,713
If not by the gun, then by the chair.

1115
01:43:39,083 --> 01:43:42,083
- And your boy Henry is going with them.
- My boy didn’t kill nobody.

1116
01:43:42,166 --> 01:43:45,916
Killed a highway patrolman
near Grapevine, Texas.

1117
01:43:46,041 --> 01:43:47,381
We have a witness,

1118
01:43:47,458 --> 01:43:49,498
ballistics, the whole book.

1119
01:43:50,625 --> 01:43:52,205
Wiretaps.

1120
01:43:52,291 --> 01:43:54,684
We know sooner
or later they’ll be coming to see you.

1121
01:43:54,708 --> 01:43:56,458
We’re gonna give your son
a chance to live.

1122
01:43:56,541 --> 01:43:57,541
How?

1123
01:43:58,625 --> 01:44:00,495
Well, he’s gonna have to
put ‘em on the spot.

1124
01:44:01,416 --> 01:44:03,956
He does, we’ll put him
on the ground, instead of in it.

1125
01:44:04,500 --> 01:44:07,750
- Meaning you’ll let him go.
- As far as Texas is concerned, yes, sir.

1126
01:44:16,750 --> 01:44:18,500
They might be by in a day or two.

1127
01:44:23,416 --> 01:44:27,706
When you get your boy alone, you tell him
to get separated first chance he gets.

1128
01:44:28,250 --> 01:44:30,000
They'll come right back to see him.

1129
01:44:30,333 --> 01:44:31,423
We'll be waiting.

1130
01:44:31,500 --> 01:44:32,670
Why should I trust you?

1131
01:44:32,750 --> 01:44:34,130
Because I said.

1132
01:44:39,708 --> 01:44:41,708
That's just how he's built.

1133
01:44:42,791 --> 01:44:44,171
Well, they got a rule.

1134
01:44:45,166 --> 01:44:46,496
If they get separated,

1135
01:44:46,708 --> 01:44:48,918
they wait a couple days
for the air to clear

1136
01:44:49,000 --> 01:44:50,750
and then meet up back at my house.

1137
01:44:52,666 --> 01:44:54,166
Clyde won’t be taken alive.

1138
01:44:54,250 --> 01:44:59,290
Neither will your boy, sir.
Unless he takes his one chance now.

1139
01:45:00,125 --> 01:45:01,375
I like my house.

1140
01:45:01,583 --> 01:45:04,003
- Excuse me?
- I like my house!

1141
01:45:05,041 --> 01:45:07,831
Clyde bought it for me and I don’t want
y’all shootin’ it up none.

1142
01:45:07,916 --> 01:45:11,076
Now they’ll be around for Henry.
There ain't but one way in one way out.

1143
01:45:11,166 --> 01:45:12,166
That's Ringgold Road.

1144
01:45:13,041 --> 01:45:14,131
Ringgold Road.

1145
01:45:16,333 --> 01:45:17,883
Once my boy gets clear,

1146
01:45:19,041 --> 01:45:20,631
well, you can kill ‘em there.

1147
01:45:22,875 --> 01:45:23,875
All right.

1148
01:46:19,833 --> 01:46:21,003
<i>Take two.</i>

1149
01:46:26,250 --> 01:46:27,580
There you go.

1150
01:46:29,500 --> 01:46:32,130
Looks like we outnumbered
by a Texan, Sanderson.

1151
01:46:32,208 --> 01:46:34,418
Yeah, well, we need
these Dallas boys, the only ones

1152
01:46:34,500 --> 01:46:36,460
who can make a positive identification.

1153
01:46:36,916 --> 01:46:38,036
Mm.

1154
01:46:39,333 --> 01:46:41,713
Old Ivy said their car loaded
with fire power.

1155
01:46:41,791 --> 01:46:45,041
They got machine guns,
hand grenades, thousand round of shells.

1156
01:46:45,125 --> 01:46:46,745
Said it’s like an armory on four wheels.

1157
01:46:46,833 --> 01:46:49,003
- Well, we'll find out.
- Gonna have us a hunt.

1158
01:46:49,083 --> 01:46:50,633
Gonna skin us some deer.

1159
01:46:51,416 --> 01:46:53,826
Dang, If I don't have
an Arkansas Straight.

1160
01:46:57,541 --> 01:47:00,751
Dallas paper gave me a camera
to film it when it happens.

1161
01:47:01,625 --> 01:47:02,625
Said he’d pay me.

1162
01:47:03,125 --> 01:47:04,125
Y’all believe that?

1163
01:47:05,083 --> 01:47:06,963
What the hell is this world coming to?

1164
01:47:07,041 --> 01:47:08,961
Well, here we go.

1165
01:47:09,416 --> 01:47:10,916
- Three sevens?
- Mm-hmm.

1166
01:47:12,625 --> 01:47:15,705
Maybe we should put six bills in the pot,
Homme, make it more interestin’.

1167
01:47:15,791 --> 01:47:20,881
No. Cap says no money in a game,
nor drinking on Sundays.

1168
01:47:20,958 --> 01:47:22,078
Can't be much fun.

1169
01:47:22,166 --> 01:47:25,626
Yeah, well, there's a place
for me in heaven, I'll tell you that.

1170
01:47:28,041 --> 01:47:29,421
What's he doing out there?

1171
01:47:29,666 --> 01:47:31,576
He likes to be alone sometimes.

1172
01:47:38,125 --> 01:47:42,535
Sheriff Smoot said you and Hamer killed
more than fifty men between you.

1173
01:47:48,625 --> 01:47:50,325
Killed more than that one evenin’.

1174
01:47:51,750 --> 01:47:53,130
I didn't mean to pry.

1175
01:47:54,750 --> 01:47:57,380
It’s all right, kid. Ante-up, gents.

1176
01:48:15,541 --> 01:48:16,541
I was young.

1177
01:48:17,541 --> 01:48:18,631
Younger than you.

1178
01:48:20,125 --> 01:48:22,785
South Texas place called Candelario.

1179
01:48:25,333 --> 01:48:29,833
Ranger Company C. Had about sixty bandits
pinned down in a dry wash.

1180
01:48:29,958 --> 01:48:32,828
These fellas burned half a dozen ranches,

1181
01:48:32,916 --> 01:48:34,326
killed a dozen,

1182
01:48:34,791 --> 01:48:36,921
raped just about as many.

1183
01:48:39,250 --> 01:48:41,750
Anyway, every time we’d ride in there

1184
01:48:41,833 --> 01:48:44,923
to take ‘em,
we’d yell out, <i>manos arribas.</i>

1185
01:48:45,125 --> 01:48:47,035
You know, hands up.

1186
01:48:48,833 --> 01:48:51,883
Well, they'd fire on us

1187
01:48:51,958 --> 01:48:54,958
and we’d lose a man.
Went on like that for two days.

1188
01:48:55,833 --> 01:48:57,173
So, they sent down

1189
01:48:57,916 --> 01:48:59,166
young Captain Hamer.

1190
01:48:59,958 --> 01:49:01,458
My friend, Pancho.

1191
01:49:03,083 --> 01:49:04,133
Cap says,

1192
01:49:05,416 --> 01:49:06,956
"What's going on out here?"

1193
01:49:07,625 --> 01:49:12,075
Any time we yell out, <i>manos arribas</i>
like the Law tells us to,

1194
01:49:13,833 --> 01:49:15,133
they open up on us.

1195
01:49:15,916 --> 01:49:18,826
Cap says, “Well, we’re going in there
'afore dawn and, this time,

1196
01:49:18,916 --> 01:49:22,576
don’t no-damn-body yell out
<i>manos arribas.</i>

1197
01:49:23,250 --> 01:49:24,250
Just shoot ‘em

1198
01:49:30,958 --> 01:49:32,498
Well, that night

1199
01:49:33,541 --> 01:49:35,881
them bandits were celebrating. Drunk.

1200
01:49:37,416 --> 01:49:39,166
Most of them asleep by the fire.

1201
01:49:39,291 --> 01:49:40,291
We went in.

1202
01:49:42,333 --> 01:49:44,833
Some of the boys refused to go.

1203
01:49:44,916 --> 01:49:47,786
Refused to just start shooting men.

1204
01:49:50,541 --> 01:49:54,171
But I went with Frank,
like I said, he's my friend.

1205
01:49:56,750 --> 01:49:58,210
He gave me the nod.

1206
01:49:59,375 --> 01:50:00,875
We let 'em have it.

1207
01:50:00,958 --> 01:50:05,538
We shot that arroyo all to hell
before most of them fellas even woke up.

1208
01:50:10,291 --> 01:50:11,291
I was

1209
01:50:12,333 --> 01:50:13,333
jittery.

1210
01:50:17,000 --> 01:50:20,670
A mule come out
from behind a cactus and I,

1211
01:50:22,333 --> 01:50:25,503
uh, shot the man riding it
half dozen times.

1212
01:50:28,750 --> 01:50:29,880
Turned out to be a

1213
01:50:31,500 --> 01:50:33,380
thirteen-year old boy just

1214
01:50:34,750 --> 01:50:35,830
trying to run away.

1215
01:50:40,166 --> 01:50:41,876
I still see his face.

1216
01:50:48,250 --> 01:50:52,170
Whole thing was over in five minutes.
Counted 54 dead.

1217
01:50:53,416 --> 01:50:56,076
Counting was over, Cap sat on a rock,

1218
01:50:56,583 --> 01:50:58,083
holstered his gun and said,

1219
01:50:59,041 --> 01:51:01,461
<i>"manos arribas,</i> you sons-a-bitches."

1220
01:51:08,750 --> 01:51:09,750
Came back,

1221
01:51:11,125 --> 01:51:12,995
Governor gave us all medals.

1222
01:51:32,833 --> 01:51:33,883
My boy got loose.

1223
01:52:05,500 --> 01:52:08,170
When he comes,
he's going to be coming from the south.

1224
01:52:08,333 --> 01:52:09,693
Which will bring him right by you.

1225
01:52:10,375 --> 01:52:12,495
Well, I figure
you fellas got it from here.

1226
01:52:13,458 --> 01:52:14,458
Ivy.

1227
01:52:14,958 --> 01:52:17,378
Turn your truck around,
park at the wrong side.

1228
01:52:17,458 --> 01:52:18,458
What?

1229
01:52:19,625 --> 01:52:20,785
You're staying with us.

1230
01:52:20,916 --> 01:52:22,576
No, that wasn't part of the deal.

1231
01:52:22,666 --> 01:52:25,376
The deal ain’t done ‘til it’s done.
Now, park it.

1232
01:52:25,916 --> 01:52:28,576
Jack up the front right bumper
and take off your tire.

1233
01:52:32,416 --> 01:52:34,536
Clyde’ll slow down and help him change it.

1234
01:52:35,125 --> 01:52:37,805
- What?
- Stash these cars. How do I know I ain't going to get shot?

1235
01:53:28,875 --> 01:53:29,705
You okay?

1236
01:53:29,791 --> 01:53:30,791
Yeah. Yes, sir.

1237
01:53:32,833 --> 01:53:35,333
We need you to identify these two.

1238
01:53:35,750 --> 01:53:39,170
Nobody said nothing about
having to pull the trigger.

1239
01:53:39,958 --> 01:53:41,788
Which means, you don't have to.

1240
01:53:41,875 --> 01:53:43,035
I'll be all right.

1241
01:53:43,125 --> 01:53:44,125
Sure?

1242
01:53:45,750 --> 01:53:46,750
Yeah.

1243
01:54:10,625 --> 01:54:11,875
When they get here, y’all

1244
01:54:13,333 --> 01:54:14,543
stay behind the blind.

1245
01:54:15,791 --> 01:54:17,171
If I present myself,

1246
01:54:17,916 --> 01:54:19,376
you fire on my command.

1247
01:54:21,208 --> 01:54:22,878
We stay in the blind.

1248
01:54:22,958 --> 01:54:23,958
Yeah.

1249
01:54:27,125 --> 01:54:28,165
You walk out there?

1250
01:54:30,541 --> 01:54:31,711
That’s an order, Gault.

1251
01:55:06,958 --> 01:55:07,958
Maney,

1252
01:55:09,416 --> 01:55:10,626
for the record, you only

1253
01:55:11,916 --> 01:55:13,916
move like a 75.

1254
01:55:28,041 --> 01:55:30,631
The reason I passed your house
that day was 'cause I

1255
01:55:34,000 --> 01:55:36,040
I wanted to spare you this.

1256
01:55:39,541 --> 01:55:40,541
That said, I’m...

1257
01:55:42,833 --> 01:55:44,173
I’m real glad you’re here.

1258
01:55:48,250 --> 01:55:49,290
Me, too, Pancho.

1259
01:55:51,208 --> 01:55:52,208
Me, too.

1260
01:56:10,291 --> 01:56:11,751
Ivy!

1261
01:56:12,458 --> 01:56:13,498
Get out there!

1262
01:56:17,250 --> 01:56:18,250
Hurry up.

1263
01:56:21,166 --> 01:56:22,166
It's them.

1264
01:56:24,833 --> 01:56:25,833
Ford V8.

1265
01:56:31,791 --> 01:56:32,791
Ted?

1266
01:56:32,875 --> 01:56:34,495
- Yeah.
- You better look.

1267
01:56:39,875 --> 01:56:41,125
Yeah. It’s Clyde.

1268
01:56:41,958 --> 01:56:42,958
This is it.

1269
01:57:17,500 --> 01:57:20,040
- Hey, Ivy. Need some help with that?
- Yeah.

1270
01:57:26,333 --> 01:57:27,333
Stick 'em up.

1271
01:59:15,000 --> 01:59:16,250
<i>Manos arribas.</i>

1272
01:59:35,000 --> 01:59:37,920
H. J. SMITH'S SONS
GENERAL MERCHANDISE

1273
01:59:38,583 --> 01:59:43,963
ARCADIA, LOUISIANA

1274
02:01:16,416 --> 02:01:17,536
Mr. Hamer?

1275
02:01:18,333 --> 02:01:19,583
Excuse me, Mr. Hamer,

1276
02:01:19,666 --> 02:01:22,306
there’s a fella on the phone
from the Associated Press in New York.

1277
02:01:22,333 --> 02:01:25,423
He says he’ll give you $1000
for a phone interview right now.

1278
02:01:26,958 --> 02:01:28,578
Got him on the line in the back.

1279
02:01:33,250 --> 02:01:34,250
Mr. Hamer?

1280
02:01:37,416 --> 02:01:38,626
Shame on you.

1281
02:02:22,791 --> 02:02:26,921
<i>The nation has been freed
from the worst killing rampage in history.</i>

1282
02:02:27,416 --> 02:02:29,956
<i>Retribution has been served
and J. Edgar Hoover</i>

1283
02:02:30,041 --> 02:02:31,631
<i>has issued a formal announcement</i>

1284
02:02:31,708 --> 02:02:33,878
<i>that the crime spree
of Bonnie and Clyde...</i>

1285
02:02:40,625 --> 02:02:44,125
Would you care to comment on your role
in the apprehension of Bonnie and Clyde?

1286
02:02:44,208 --> 02:02:46,578
I knew Hamer and Gault
would get the job done.

1287
02:02:46,708 --> 02:02:48,208
That’s why I chose ‘em.

1288
02:02:48,291 --> 02:02:49,541
<i>Bottom line.</i>
