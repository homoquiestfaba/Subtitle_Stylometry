00:00:15,583 --> 00:00:17,282
<i> THEY SAY HAVING</i>
    <i> A SISTER IS LIKE HAVING</i>

2
00:00:17,284 --> 00:00:19,218
         <i> A BEST FRIEND</i>
     <i> YOU CAN'T GET RID OF.</i>

3
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:22,321
   <i> YOU KNOW, WHATEVER YOU DO</i>
    <i> THEY'LL STILL BE THERE.</i>

4
00:00:22,323 --> 00:00:24,723
<i> WELL THAT WAS NEVER OUR STORY.</i>

5
00:00:24,725 --> 00:00:30,329
    <i> OUR STORY IS ABOUT HOW</i>
 <i> SISTERS CAN SINK EACH OTHER--</i>
    <i> REALLY SINK EACH OTHER.</i>

6
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:35,127
        MORNING, MARTHA.

7
00:01:35,129 --> 00:01:36,462
           HI, ERIC.

8
00:01:36,464 --> 00:01:38,797
      - THAT YOUR SISTER?
      - OH, YEAH, SURE IS.

00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:40,299
              HI.

10
00:01:40,301 --> 00:01:41,767
        SMELLS LIKE PISS
           BACK HERE.

11
00:01:41,769 --> 00:01:43,735
         WOW. I THOUGHT
    YOUR SISTER WAS KIDDING

12
00:01:43,737 --> 00:01:44,837
         WHEN SHE SAID
     YOU WERE A BUZZ KILL.

13
00:01:54,481 --> 00:01:57,616
            SHANNON?
      HEY, SHANNON! SHAN!

14
00:01:57,618 --> 00:01:59,518
            SHANNON!

15
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:06,859
     GREAT. NOW WE'RE GOING
      TO HAVE TO CLEAN UP
         AFTER A BUNCH

16
00:02:06,861 --> 00:02:09,361
       OF SWEATY LEZZIES.

17
00:02:09,363 --> 00:02:11,196
          GOD, WHAT IS
        WITH YOU TODAY?

18
00:02:11,198 --> 00:02:12,798
    WHY DID YOU HAVE TO TELL
   THAT GUY I'M A BUZZ KILL?

19
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,633
  OH MY GOD! SHANNON JACKSON?

20
00:02:14,635 --> 00:02:16,802
            - WHAT?
      - IT'S ME! KRISTEN!

21
00:02:16,804 --> 00:02:18,403
   I WORK AT THE FRONT DESK.

22
00:02:18,405 --> 00:02:19,638
             OKAY.

23
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,540
         YOU REMEMBER,
         KRISTEN METZ?

24
00:02:21,542 --> 00:02:22,841
        WOW, OH MY GOD.

25
00:02:22,843 --> 00:02:24,143
     YOU DON'T REMEMBER ME?

26
00:02:24,145 --> 00:02:25,344
          NO? KRISTEN?

27
00:02:25,346 --> 00:02:26,678
     REMEMBER, I WAS, LIKE,

28
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,580
      "AH! MY ANKLE! OW!"

29
00:02:28,582 --> 00:02:29,882
         DID I KICK YOU
         IN THE ANKLE?

30
00:02:29,884 --> 00:02:32,151
THEN I WAS LIKE "SIGN MY CAST!"

31
00:02:32,153 --> 00:02:33,652
   AND THEN-- YOU COULDN'T--

32
00:02:33,654 --> 00:02:37,789
       YOU DIDN'T DO IT,
  BUT, GOD, I KNEW IT WAS YOU!

33
00:02:37,791 --> 00:02:39,258
         ARE WE TALKING
       ABOUT HIGH SCHOOL?

34
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:40,826
             - YES.
    - OKAY, I REMEMBER YOU.

35
00:02:40,828 --> 00:02:42,161
          OKAY, GREAT.

36
00:02:42,163 --> 00:02:43,195
  AND WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

37
00:02:43,197 --> 00:02:44,897
      I THOUGHT YOU WERE,

38
00:02:44,899 --> 00:02:47,566
     LIKE, TEACHING AT THAT
     FANCY PANTS SCHOOL IN
       CARMEL BY THE SEA?

39
00:02:47,568 --> 00:02:49,268
      YEAH, I WAS BUT THEN

00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:51,637

  I FUCKED A BUNCH OF PEOPLE.

41
00:02:51,639 --> 00:02:53,772
             - OH.
            - YEAH.

42
00:02:53,774 --> 00:02:55,707
             WOOPS.

43
00:02:55,709 --> 00:02:58,510
    JANITOR, LACROSSE COACH,
          COUPLE SUBS,

44
00:02:58,512 --> 00:03:01,246
        THE HEADMASTER--
    THAT WAS MY BIG MISTAKE

45
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:02,915
    ACTUALLY BECAUSE WE GOT
      CAUGHT BY SOME KIDS

46
00:03:02,917 --> 00:03:04,550
      UNDER THE BLEACHERS
         AT HOMECOMING.

47
00:03:04,552 --> 00:03:05,918
              OH.

48
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:08,587
           SO NOW I'M
   A REGISTERED SEX OFFENDER.

49
00:03:08,589 --> 00:03:10,322
              YAY!

50
00:03:10,324 --> 00:03:11,790
             YEAH.

51
00:03:11,792 --> 00:03:14,560
 OH, YOU CAN'T CLEAN ANY ROOMS
       WITH KIDS IN THEM.

52
00:03:14,562 --> 00:03:17,362
    BUT THAT'S FINE. THEY'RE
  ALWAYS REALLY DIRTY ANYWAY.

53
00:03:17,364 --> 00:03:20,933
    OH, BY THE WAY, I SUCKED
    YOUR BOYFRIEND'S DICK AT

54
00:03:20,935 --> 00:03:22,201
   CHRIS DELUCA'S PROM PARTY.

55
00:03:22,203 --> 00:03:23,468
I'M SORRY?

56
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:24,970
     YEAH. I THINK HE MUST
     ATE A LOT OF PINEAPPLE

57
00:03:24,972 --> 00:03:27,506
  BECAUSE HIS SPUNK IS TASTY.

58
00:03:27,508 --> 00:03:29,508
       YOU GUYS MARRIED?
       IS IT SCOTT METZ?

59
00:03:31,945 --> 00:03:33,745
   SO I GUESS WE MAY AS WELL
      JUST JUMP IN, RIGHT?

60
00:03:33,747 --> 00:03:35,447
     GET STARTED, BASICALLY

61
00:03:35,449 --> 00:03:37,583
   YOU JUST GET YOUR KEY OUT
      OF LANYARD LIKE THAT

62
00:03:37,585 --> 00:03:39,818
       AND THEN YOU KNOCK
       THREE TIMES, YEAH?

63
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:41,453
       AND THEN YOU SAY--

64
00:03:41,455 --> 00:03:44,323
FUCK OFF! I'M SLEEPING!

65
00:03:44,325 --> 00:03:45,924
  OKAY, LET'S NOT GO IN THERE.

66
00:03:45,926 --> 00:03:50,596
  UGH. PEOPLE ARE DISGUSTING.

67
00:03:50,598 --> 00:03:52,698
          CHECK THIS.
     THIS IS HOW YOU PUT ON
       A NEW PILLOW CASE.

68
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:55,234
      THEN WHAT YOU DO IS
   THE DOUBLE-FOLD MANEUVER.

69
00:03:55,236 --> 00:03:56,835
    THIS IS ALSO REALLY NICE

70
00:03:56,837 --> 00:04:00,739
    TO DO IN YOUR OWN HOME,
      AND THEN LIKE THAT,
         FLUFF, FLUFF.

71
00:04:00,741 --> 00:04:02,507
        PERFECT P-CASE.

72
00:04:02,509 --> 00:04:04,543
      WHY ARE YOU CHANGING
       THE PILLOW CASES?

73
00:04:04,545 --> 00:04:06,745
     IT'S THE SAME PEOPLE.
   THEY'RE NOT CHECKING OUT.

74
00:04:06,747 --> 00:04:08,814
  OKAY, HOW ABOUT WE JUST TRY
       TO KEEP THIS JOB,

75
00:04:08,816 --> 00:04:10,449
   SHAN, AND NOT BE SO LAZY?

76
00:04:10,451 --> 00:04:11,883
             FINE.

77
00:04:11,885 --> 00:04:14,853
 WHAT DO I DO WITH THEIR SHIT?
     DO I HAVE TO FOLD IT?

78
00:04:14,855 --> 00:04:18,323
      OKAY, IF I RAPED YOU
  RIGHT NOW WHAT WOULD YOU DO?

79
00:04:18,325 --> 00:04:19,925
      I DON'T WANT TO PLAY
      THIS GAME RIGHT NOW.

80
00:04:19,927 --> 00:04:21,560
    YOU NEVER WANT TO PLAY.

81
00:04:21,562 --> 00:04:23,562
         YEAH, I KNOW,
  THAT'S WHY I'M NOT PLAYING.

82
00:04:23,564 --> 00:04:26,431
  THIS WAS A STUPID GAME WHEN
 WE WERE KIDS AND IT STILL IS.

83
00:04:26,433 --> 00:04:27,799
         HEY, REMEMBER
   THAT OLD FRENCH PRESIDENT

84
00:04:27,801 --> 00:04:29,735
WHO ATTACKED THAT AFRICAN MAID?

85
00:04:29,737 --> 00:04:32,271
     HE WAS LIKE A GRANDPA
      AND SHE STILL HAD TO
         SPIT HIS JIZZ.

86
00:04:32,273 --> 00:04:35,374
         WELL, I'M NOT
    SPITTING ANYONE'S JIZZ.

87
00:04:35,376 --> 00:04:37,409
      OKAY, IF I RAPED YOU
      RIGHT NOW WHAT WOULD
            YOU DO?

88
00:04:37,411 --> 00:04:39,678
       NO ONE'S RAPING ME
        IN THIS UNIFORM.

89
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,480
   IT'S NOT REALLY MY COLOR.

90
00:04:41,482 --> 00:04:44,750
 WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IN A RAPE
   SITUATION IS YELL, "FIRE!"

91
00:04:44,752 --> 00:04:46,451
   WHY WOULDN'T I YELL RAPE?

92
00:04:46,453 --> 00:04:48,420
    NO ONE RESPONDS TO THAT.

93
00:04:48,422 --> 00:04:50,656
     WHO ARE YOUR FRIENDS?

94
00:04:50,658 --> 00:04:53,358
      SO BASICALLY YOU PUT
      YOUR LAUNDRY INSIDE
           THE UNIT.

95
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,826
 AND THEN YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE

96
00:04:54,828 --> 00:04:58,030
       YOU HAVE FULL LOAD
 BEFORE YOU START THE MACHINE.

97
00:04:58,032 --> 00:04:59,798
          HEY, MARTHA.

98
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,466
          HEY, JERRY.
     HOW WAS YOUR VACATION?

99
00:05:01,468 --> 00:05:04,036
     DOLLYWOOD WAS AWESOME.

100
00:05:04,038 --> 00:05:05,871
      YOU MUST BE SHANNON.

101
00:05:05,873 --> 00:05:07,639
     WELCOME TO THE FAMILY.

102
00:05:07,641 --> 00:05:11,410
        YOUR SISTER SAID
  THAT YOU'RE A GREAT SISTER.

103
00:05:11,412 --> 00:05:14,913
      I'VE GOT MY BUCKET.

104
00:05:14,915 --> 00:05:17,849
   AND THEN WHEN THAT'S DONE
  YOU CAN JUST MOVE OVER AND,

105
00:05:17,851 --> 00:05:19,384
     YOU KNOW, CLOSE IT UP.

106
00:05:19,386 --> 00:05:20,886
           HIT START.

107
00:05:20,888 --> 00:05:22,754
     THEN ONCE THAT'S GOING
     YOU CAN MOVE OVER HERE

108
00:05:22,756 --> 00:05:24,089
    AND START FOLDING STUFF.

109
00:05:24,091 --> 00:05:25,724
          WHO IS THAT?

110
00:05:25,726 --> 00:05:27,993
      WHO? JERRY? OH, HE'S
      THE EXECUTIVE MAID.

111
00:05:27,995 --> 00:05:29,594
        HE'S WORKED HERE
       FOR LIKE 15 YEARS.

112
00:05:29,596 --> 00:05:31,063
      SO HE'S THE TOP DOG.

113
00:05:31,065 --> 00:05:32,664
YOU'RE KIDDING. THAT'S OUR BOSS?

114
00:05:36,736 --> 00:05:38,403
           GOD, SHAN.

115
00:05:38,405 --> 00:05:39,638
     WHAT? I'M JUST SAYING.

116
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:41,506
    DON'T BE SO INSENSITIVE.

117
00:05:41,508 --> 00:05:43,975
  YOU'RE LUCKY THAT HE THINKS
SEX OFFENDERS FIGHT SEX CRIMES.

118
00:05:45,745 --> 00:05:48,914
       YOU KNOW THIS SPOT
     IS REALLY COMPETITIVE.

119
00:05:48,916 --> 00:05:50,882
       YOU WANT TO GO GET
      SOME HUMP DAY DRINKS

120
00:05:50,884 --> 00:05:54,820
  TO CELEBRATE YOUR FIRST DAY?

121
00:05:54,822 --> 00:05:56,722
          NOT REALLY.

122
00:06:06,733 --> 00:06:08,734
            COME ON.
     WHO'S A BETTER DANCER?

123
00:06:08,736 --> 00:06:10,869
       ME OR JODIE FOSTER
       IN "THE ACCUSED?"

124
00:06:10,871 --> 00:06:13,004
      THAT'S NOT A CONTEST
        YOU WANT TO WIN.

125
00:06:15,775 --> 00:06:17,943
       I LIKE THIS PLACE
      'CAUSE OF THE MUSIC.

126
00:06:17,945 --> 00:06:19,111
         THAT'S GREAT.

127
00:06:19,113 --> 00:06:21,446
         AND THE GIRLS.

128
00:06:21,448 --> 00:06:23,081
     I'M SO GLAD YOUR BACK.

129
00:06:23,083 --> 00:06:25,083
WHEN ARE YOU GOING TO TELL ABOUT
  THE LAST FEW WEEKS OF REHAB?

130
00:06:25,085 --> 00:06:26,685
            I'M NOT.

131
00:06:26,687 --> 00:06:28,420
   REHAB IS REHAB, YOU KNOW?

132
00:06:28,422 --> 00:06:31,556
IT'S MY RECOVERY. IT'S PRIVATE.
         IT'S MY THING.

133
00:06:31,558 --> 00:06:32,657
     WELL HOW DO YOU THINK
     YOU'RE DOING, THOUGH?

134
00:06:32,659 --> 00:06:33,825
  DO YOU THINK YOU'RE BETTER?

135
00:06:33,827 --> 00:06:35,761
         I DON'T KNOW.

136
00:06:35,763 --> 00:06:38,463
          I FEEL NUMB.

137
00:06:38,465 --> 00:06:43,702
          WELL, HEY,
       AT LEAST NUMBNESS
      IS A FEELING, RIGHT?

138
00:06:43,704 --> 00:06:45,604
          TO NUMBNESS.

139
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:52,577
         WHAT WAS THAT?

140
00:06:52,579 --> 00:06:54,012
         WHAT WAS WHAT?

141
00:06:54,014 --> 00:06:57,449
          THAT, SHAN.
     THAT DIDN'T SEEM NUMB.

142
00:06:57,451 --> 00:07:01,052
      I'M ALLOWED TO LOOK
     AT OTHER HUMAN BEINGS.

143
00:07:01,054 --> 00:07:04,022
     HOW'S THAT FREELOADING
     WEIRDO YOU'RE DATING?

144
00:07:04,024 --> 00:07:07,626
         WHO? ALICIA?
      SHE'S NOT A WEIRDO.

145
00:07:07,628 --> 00:07:09,060
     MAYBE YOU'RE THINKING
      ABOUT SOMEBODY ELSE.

146
00:07:09,062 --> 00:07:10,529
      I THINK I'M THINKING
           OF ALICIA.

147
00:07:10,531 --> 00:07:12,197
       UM, I DON'T KNOW.

148
00:07:12,199 --> 00:07:14,065
SHE'S JUST GOING THROUGH A HARD
TIME RIGHT NOW, SO WE SPLIT UP.

149
00:07:14,067 --> 00:07:15,700
      SHE WANTED TO LIKE--

150
00:07:15,702 --> 00:07:17,102
        SUCK SOME DICKS?

151
00:07:17,104 --> 00:07:19,004
    NO, SHE DIDN'T WANT TO--
         STOP, SHANNON.

152
00:07:19,006 --> 00:07:20,639
  SHE'S A LOSER STRAIGHT GIRL

153
00:07:20,641 --> 00:07:22,541
      WHO WAS NEVER GOING
    TO SETTLE DOWN WITH YOU.

154
00:07:22,543 --> 00:07:24,042
     I LIKE HELPING PEOPLE.

155
00:07:24,044 --> 00:07:25,744
 YEAH, YOU KNOW, WHO ELSE DID?

156
00:07:25,746 --> 00:07:27,846
      MOM, AND IT LEFT HER
  WITH TWO TITS FULL OF CANCER

157
00:07:27,848 --> 00:07:28,880
         SO ENJOY THAT.

158
00:07:32,218 --> 00:07:34,085
        I'M GONNA GO PAY
        FOR THESE BEERS.

159
00:07:34,087 --> 00:07:35,153
           AS USUAL.

160
00:07:45,097 --> 00:07:47,799
HEY, SHAN,
    YOU SURE YOU DON'T WANT
     TO GO WITH ME, RIGHT?

161
00:07:47,801 --> 00:07:49,901
       I HAVE A MEETING.

162
00:07:49,903 --> 00:07:51,903
      YOU WANT SOME FIDDLE
        FOR YOUR PADDLE?

163
00:07:51,905 --> 00:07:54,906
     NO, I'M GOOD. I'LL GET
     SOMETHING ON THE WAY.

164
00:07:54,908 --> 00:07:57,075
        OKAY, IF YOU GET
   HUNGRY THERE'S SOME STUFF
        IN THE FREEZER.

      THERE'S BAGEL BITES,
     THREE CHEESE, CHEESE,
     SAUSAGE AND PEPPERONI.

166
00:08:02,549 --> 00:08:04,716
     STOP TREATING ME LIKE
            I'M DAD.

167
00:08:04,718 --> 00:08:07,686
        WELL, YOU KNOW,
         SOMEONE HAD TO
       TAKE CARE OF HIM.

168
00:08:07,688 --> 00:08:09,788
LOOK, IF YOU WANT SOMETHING ELSE

00:08:14,928 --> 00:08:18,697
     AND THERE'S PINEAPPLE
       AND COUNTRY CROCK.

174
00:08:18,699 --> 00:08:20,131

       GOING TO BE OKAY?

175
00:08:20,133 --> 00:08:21,833
             YEAH.

00:08:21,835 --> 00:08:23,001
      PROMISE YOU'RE GOING
    TO EAT SOMETHING, RIGHT,

00:08:23,003 --> 00:08:24,002

         OKAY, SEE YOU,
    WOULDN'T WANT TO BE YOU.

00:08:48,128 --> 00:08:50,228

00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:52,898

00:09:18,191 --> 00:09:20,992
      THANKS FOR THE TEXT
     BUT YOU WERE SUPPOSED
    TO CALL, NOT COME OVER.

194
00:09:20,994 --> 00:09:22,627
              OH.

            COME ON.

198
00:09:27,734 --> 00:09:29,701
             UH...

199
00:09:29,703 --> 00:09:32,571
       YEAH, NO. I CAN'T
        BECAUSE I FORGOT
    TONIGHT WAS DATE NIGHT.

200
00:09:32,573 --> 00:09:34,739
      JULIE IS COMING HOME
    AND WE'RE GOING TO PLAY
          "SCRABBLE."

201
00:09:34,741 --> 00:09:36,341
           WHAT? GOD.

202
00:09:36,343 --> 00:09:38,276
       - YOUR WIFE SUCKS.
        - YEAH, I KNOW.

203
00:09:38,278 --> 00:09:40,679
   EVERYTHING BUT YOUR DICK.

204
00:09:40,681 --> 00:09:43,882
           I STAYED
       IN THAT HOTEL ROOM
         FOR TWO WEEKS

205
00:09:43,884 --> 00:09:45,317
   SO THAT MY SISTER WOULDN'T
     KNOW I GOT KICKED OUT

206
00:09:45,319 --> 00:09:47,152
       OF REHAB FOR YOU.

207
00:09:47,154 --> 00:09:48,820
             YEAH,
     I'M THE ONE WHO FORGED
       THE RELEASE PAPERS

208
00:09:48,822 --> 00:09:49,854
     SO THE COURT WOULDN'T
     BE ALL OVER YOUR ASS.

209
00:09:49,856 --> 00:09:51,256
        IT WAS THE LEAST
         YOU COULD DO.

210
00:09:51,258 --> 00:09:52,624
        I'M PRETTY SURE
   THERAPISTS AREN'T SUPPOSED

211
00:09:52,626 --> 00:09:54,225
 TO FUCK THEIR REHAB PATIENTS.

212
00:09:54,227 --> 00:09:56,294
   THERAPISTS ARE SCREWED UP
 PEOPLE. EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT.

213
00:09:56,296 --> 00:09:58,363
       YOU'RE THE ONE WHO
      SHARON STONED ME IN
     THE OFFICE, REMEMBER?

214
00:09:58,365 --> 00:10:00,231
         - THAT'S HOT.
       - IT WAS VERY HOT.

215
00:10:00,233 --> 00:10:01,833
        "BASIC INSTINCT"
        IS A GREAT MOVIE.

216
00:10:01,835 --> 00:10:03,134
          BUT I CAN'T.

217
00:10:03,136 --> 00:10:04,669
    YOU SAID WHEN I GET BACK
        TO MY SISTER'S,

218
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:06,905
          WE'D BE BACK
     ON A REGULAR SCHEDULE.

219
00:10:06,907 --> 00:10:08,306
      I NEED TO GET LAID.

220
00:10:08,308 --> 00:10:10,308
           YOU KNOW,
   I THINK AS YOUR THERAPIST

221
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:13,912
     YOU SHOULD PROBABLY GO
  TO A MEETING TONIGHT, OKAY?

222
00:10:13,914 --> 00:10:17,048
            I'M WET.

223
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:20,752
       FINE, MEETINGS ARE
   GREAT PLACES TO GET LAID.

224
00:10:20,754 --> 00:10:22,621
      OKAY, I CAN FUCK YOU
           IN THE CAR

225
00:10:22,623 --> 00:10:24,789
     BUT I HAVE 10 MINUTES
    AND THAT'S IT. LET'S GO.

226
00:10:30,863 --> 00:10:35,333
        FROM YOUR HIPS.
        FROM YOUR HIPS.

227
00:10:35,335 --> 00:10:37,235
      WATCH YOUR FOOTWORK.

228
00:10:43,876 --> 00:10:46,277
     I PROMISE I WON'T MAKE
          YOU DO MORE.

229
00:10:51,417 --> 00:10:53,985

00:10:53,987 --> 00:10:57,188
             OKAY.

00:10:57,190 --> 00:10:59,791
           KRAV MAGA.
WE HAVE ONE RULE, ONE RULE ONLY.

232
00:10:59,793 --> 00:11:01,660
      NEVER STOP FIGHTING!

00:11:01,662 --> 00:11:03,762
            - HIYA!
            - HIYA!

234
00:11:03,764 --> 00:11:05,296

       I'M HERE AT NOON.

237
00:11:10,737 --> 00:11:12,270
      THE REST OF THE TIME

238
00:11:12,272 --> 00:11:16,041
  I'M STUDYING TO BECOME A NUN
      SO DON'T BOTHER ME.

239
00:11:19,078 --> 00:11:21,680
            - HELLO.
   - HEY, KELLY. GREAT CLASS.

240
00:11:21,682 --> 00:11:24,249
    AMAZING FOCUS TONIGHT.
            REALLY.

241
00:11:24,251 --> 00:11:27,318
 I'M TOTALLY RETHINKING MY PLAN
  OF KNIFING YOU IN AN ALLEY.

242
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:29,821
         I DIDN'T KNOW
       YOU HAD THAT PLAN.

243
00:11:29,823 --> 00:11:32,190
       HEY HAVE YOU SEEN
         ALICIA AROUND?

244
00:11:32,192 --> 00:11:33,792
         I JUST THOUGHT
      THAT I WOULD SEE HER

245
00:11:33,794 --> 00:11:35,760
       'CAUSE SHE USUALLY
      WORKS OUT AT NIGHT.

246
00:11:35,762 --> 00:11:36,928
   I MEAN, THANK GOD I DIDN'T
       'CAUSE IT'S JUST--

247
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:38,163
      IT'S WEIRD BECAUSE,
           YOU KNOW,

248
00:11:38,165 --> 00:11:39,898
       SHE CAN'T WORK OUT
        IN THE MORNING.

249
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:40,899
    AND SHE DOESN'T GET DOWN
    WITH HER PARALEGAL STUFF

250
00:11:40,901 --> 00:11:42,834
        UNTIL LIKE 7:00.

251
00:11:42,836 --> 00:11:44,302
     AND THEN SHE CAN ONLY
        REALLY WORK OUT
     BETWEEN 7:30 AND 8:30

252
00:11:44,304 --> 00:11:45,904
    BECAUSE SHE HAS TO WATCH
    "THE GOOD WIFE" AT 9:00.

253
00:11:45,906 --> 00:11:47,906
      AND SHE'S NOT HERE.

254
00:11:47,908 --> 00:11:50,375
      I HAVEN'T SEEN HER.

255
00:11:50,377 --> 00:11:51,876
      I PROBABLY SHOULDN'T
         TELL YOU THIS

256
00:11:51,878 --> 00:11:53,344
       BUT I REALLY THINK
       I PULLED SOMETHING

257
00:11:53,346 --> 00:11:55,447
       LIKE, I MEAN GLUTS
          BACK THERE.

258
00:11:55,449 --> 00:11:58,983
   I PROBABLY SHOULDN'T HAVE
   HAD THOSE BEERS PRE-CLASS.

259
00:11:58,985 --> 00:12:01,219
          THAT'S OKAY.

260
00:12:01,221 --> 00:12:04,989
   WHY DON'T WE GO SOMEWHERE
   AND CONTINUE HAVING BEERS?

261
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:07,759
  AND THEN GET SOME THAI FOOD
         OR SOMETHING.

262
00:12:07,761 --> 00:12:08,960
    DO YOU WANT TO DO THAT?

263
00:12:08,962 --> 00:12:10,495
          I LOVE THAI.

264
00:12:10,497 --> 00:12:13,064
       IT'S JUST IT SUCKS
  BECAUSE I CAN'T TONIGHT SO,

265
00:12:13,066 --> 00:12:14,999
  YOU KNOW, MY SISTER IS BACK

266
00:12:15,001 --> 00:12:16,935
  AND I JUST-- I DON'T WANT TO
 LEAVE HER HOME ALONE TOO LONG.

267
00:12:16,937 --> 00:12:18,002
      SHE'S STILL FRAGILE.

268
00:12:18,004 --> 00:12:19,938
          OKAY, COOL.

269
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:22,974
      I MEAN NOT COOL THAT
        SHE'S FRAGILE OR
     WHATEVER. I'M SORRY--

270
00:12:22,976 --> 00:12:24,476
      WHAT'S UP, SHORTIES?

271
00:12:24,478 --> 00:12:26,077
             WHAT?

272
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:30,415
       I WAS JUST TRYING
    TO MAKE SOME SMALL TALK.

273
00:12:30,417 --> 00:12:31,783
              BYE.

274
00:12:31,785 --> 00:12:33,852
              BYE.

275
00:12:33,854 --> 00:12:39,257
      TODAY WE'RE TALKING
   ABOUT OUR BOTTOMS, SO P.S.
          ON THE TOPS.

276
00:12:39,259 --> 00:12:42,093
  WATCH THE TRIGGER MATERIAL,
            PLEASE.

277
00:12:42,095 --> 00:12:43,895
         SORRY, DENISE.

278
00:12:43,897 --> 00:12:46,998
TALKING ABOUT OUR ROCK BOTTOMS.

279
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,267
          I WAS LIVING
     A PRETTY AWESOME LIFE.

280
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:52,303
  I WORKED AT "THE OPRAH SHOW"
          IN CHICAGO.

281
00:12:52,305 --> 00:12:54,305
   I STARTED AS AN ASSISTANT,

282
00:12:54,307 --> 00:12:56,274
        WORKED MY WAY UP
     TO ASSOCIATE PRODUCER.

283
00:12:56,276 --> 00:12:58,276
  I WAS MAKING A LOT OF MONEY.

284
00:12:58,278 --> 00:13:02,781
 AND I WAS DOING A LOT OF BLOW,
      LIKE, A LOT OF BLOW.

285
00:13:02,783 --> 00:13:04,783
   AND YOU KNOW HOW BLOW IS.
      IT'S VERY SLIMMING.

286
00:13:04,785 --> 00:13:07,318
   I HAD LIKE ABS TO MY NECK.

287
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:10,889
    I LOOKED LIKE A FUCKING
 PAKISTANI MARK-PAUL GOSSELAAR.

288
00:13:10,891 --> 00:13:14,192
       THAT'S ZACK MORRIS
   FROM "SAVED BY THE BELL."

289
00:13:14,194 --> 00:13:15,560
  EVERYTHING WAS GOING GREAT.

290
00:13:15,562 --> 00:13:21,332
    I HAD THAT SHIT ON LOCK,
        OR SO I THOUGHT.

291
00:13:21,334 --> 00:13:23,334
     CUT TO TWO YEARS LATER

292
00:13:23,336 --> 00:13:26,805
    AND I WAKE UP COMPLETELY
     NAKED IN AN ABANDONED
       CONSTRUCTION SITE

293
00:13:26,807 --> 00:13:29,407
   OUTSIDE OF WRIGLEY FIELD.

294
00:13:29,409 --> 00:13:31,042
      HOW DID I GET THERE?

295
00:13:31,044 --> 00:13:34,212
         I DON'T KNOW.
  I DON'T EVEN LIKE BASEBALL.

296
00:13:34,214 --> 00:13:38,116
        ANYWAY WHEN I...

297
00:13:38,118 --> 00:13:42,020
         DID MAKE IT TO
  WORK THAT DAY, I GOT FIRED.

298
00:13:42,022 --> 00:13:44,956
     OPRAH WAS VERY STRICT
          ABOUT THAT.

299
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:49,460
   I WAS THIS CLOSE TO OPRAH,
     LITERALLY THIS CLOSE.

300
00:13:49,462 --> 00:13:52,063
  SHE WOULD WALK RIGHT BY ME.

301
00:13:52,065 --> 00:13:55,133
    AND I THREW IT ALL AWAY
      FOR DRUGS AND DICK--

302
00:13:55,135 --> 00:13:59,170
    MEDIOCRE, MEDIOCRE DICK.

303
00:13:59,172 --> 00:14:00,371
   PRETTY GOOD DRUGS THOUGH.

304
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:04,275
           THANK YOU.

305
00:14:04,277 --> 00:14:07,078
    I DON'T, LIKE, CONSIDER
     LOSING A JOB A BOTTOM.

306
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,112
    IT WASN'T JUST ANY JOB.

307
00:14:08,114 --> 00:14:09,547
IT WAS A JOB WITH OPRAH WINFREY.

308
00:14:09,549 --> 00:14:12,283
 WHO GIVES A SHIT ABOUT OPRAH?

309
00:14:12,285 --> 00:14:13,551
            AMERICA.

310
00:14:13,553 --> 00:14:14,986
         SHE'S A BITCH.

311
00:14:19,291 --> 00:14:21,559
SHAN, THE SMOG INDEX
            IS AT 2.

312
00:14:21,561 --> 00:14:23,962
   IT'S A GREAT DAY. GET UP.

313
00:14:23,964 --> 00:14:25,964
           HEY, SHAN,

314
00:14:25,966 --> 00:14:29,033
I LAID OUT YOUR UNIFORM AND THE
SHOWER'S HOT AND READY FOR YOU.

315
00:14:29,035 --> 00:14:30,168
I'M GOING TO MAKE US BREAKFAST.

316
00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:31,302
             OKAY.

317
00:14:31,304 --> 00:14:32,637
YOU NEED TO GET UP.

318
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:34,906
          I HEARD YOU.

319
00:14:34,908 --> 00:14:37,208
I'M EMPLOYEE
    OF THE MONTH SO I DON'T
        WANT TO BE LATE.

320
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:38,943
       I KNOW YOU DON'T.

321
00:14:41,981 --> 00:14:43,481
  YOU SHOULDN'T EAT THAT CRAP.

322
00:14:43,483 --> 00:14:47,285
     YOU KNOW, YOU'VE BEEN
    EDGY ALL MORNING, SHAN.

323
00:14:47,287 --> 00:14:49,520
 I THOUGHT THOSE MEETINGS WERE
SUPPOSED TO HELP MELLOW YOU OUT.

324
00:14:49,522 --> 00:14:52,957
      IT'S CALLED PROGRESS
        NOT PERFECTION.

325
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:56,060
       AND I DON'T CHANGE
     THE FACT THAT I STILL
    LIVE IN THIS SHIT BOWL.

326
00:14:56,062 --> 00:15:00,031
HEY, IF YOU HATE FRESNO SO MUCH
     WHY DID YOU COME BACK?

327
00:15:00,033 --> 00:15:03,067
     OBVIOUSLY BECAUSE I'VE
     MADE A SERIES OF POOR
        LIFE DECISIONS.

328
00:15:03,069 --> 00:15:05,536
LOOK, POSITIVE THINKING
    MEANS POSITIVE RESULTS.

329
00:15:05,538 --> 00:15:09,173
       HEY, I OWN A HOME.
   THAT'S MY AMERICAN DREAM.

330
00:15:09,175 --> 00:15:12,377
      LOCATION, LOCATION,
           LOCATION.

331
00:15:25,357 --> 00:15:28,359
          HEY, NANCY.

332
00:15:32,231 --> 00:15:33,498
         WE'RE ACTUALLY
          GOING DOWN.

333
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:34,599
           OH, YEAH?

334
00:15:34,601 --> 00:15:38,102
  I'LL TAKE THE RIDE WITH YOU.

335
00:15:38,104 --> 00:15:39,437
        YOU'RE NEW HERE.

336
00:15:39,439 --> 00:15:43,441
   I KNOW EVERYONE WHO WORKS
      IN THE HOTEL. SO...

337
00:15:43,443 --> 00:15:45,576
        HOW DO YOU LIKE
        THE JOB SO FAR?

338
00:15:45,578 --> 00:15:48,112
         I CLEAN ROOMS.
  HOW DO YOU THINK I LIKE IT?

339
00:15:48,114 --> 00:15:49,113
             RIGHT.

340
00:15:50,383 --> 00:15:52,016
      ENJOY YOUR BURRITO.

341
00:15:52,018 --> 00:15:53,685
   HAVE A GREAT DAY, LADIES.

342
00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:01,192
  I HATE THAT GUY. HE'S ALWAYS
     HERE WITH PROSTITUTES.

343
00:16:01,194 --> 00:16:03,261
  PROSTITUTES HAVE TO EAT TOO.

344
00:16:03,263 --> 00:16:05,096
       WELL, HE'S GROSS.

345
00:16:05,098 --> 00:16:07,598
           HE'S FINE.
    DON'T BE SO JUDGMENTAL.

346
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,300
 WE'RE STILL NOT CLEANING 400.

347
00:16:09,302 --> 00:16:12,337
HIS ROOM SMELLS LIKE BURNT HAIR
   AND HE REUSES OLD CONDOMS.

348
00:16:12,339 --> 00:16:13,638
       NOBODY DOES THAT.

349
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:15,073
            HE DOES.

350
00:16:15,075 --> 00:16:16,975
            - SHAN.
            - WHAT?

351
00:16:16,977 --> 00:16:19,677
       HE HANGS THEM OVER
      THE SHOWER ROD LIKE
         WIENER COZIES.

352
00:16:19,679 --> 00:16:21,646
       WELL, THAT'S FOUL.

353
00:16:21,648 --> 00:16:23,481
       I APPRECIATE YOUR
      CREATIVITY RIGHT NOW

354
00:16:23,483 --> 00:16:25,550
 BUT THIS ISN'T AN ART PROJECT.
  THIS IS A PROFESSIONAL JOB.

355
00:16:25,552 --> 00:16:27,185
 YOU TOLD ME TO STOCK MY CART.

356
00:16:27,187 --> 00:16:29,587
     I AM STOCKING MY CART.

357
00:16:29,589 --> 00:16:31,022
     YOU'RE OVER-STOCKING.

358
00:16:31,024 --> 00:16:32,457
        THAT IS WAY TOO
       MUCH TOILET PAPER.

359
00:16:32,459 --> 00:16:33,658
        NO ONE IS GOING
TO GO TO THE BATHROOM THAT MUCH.

360
00:16:45,471 --> 00:16:48,239
    UM, YOU KNOW, I'LL TAKE
       ROOMS 403 TO 408.

361
00:16:48,241 --> 00:16:49,674
        WELL, ALL RIGHT.

362
00:16:49,676 --> 00:16:51,409
   ARE YOU SURE YOU'RE GOING
    TO BE FINE ON YOUR OWN?

363
00:16:51,411 --> 00:16:53,478
         I THINK I CAN
      CLEAN PUBES OFF SOAP
           BY MYSELF.

364
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:55,346
           THANK YOU.

365
00:17:23,743 --> 00:17:25,476
     HEY, DID YOU GET THAT
      PICTURE I SENT YOU?

366
00:17:25,478 --> 00:17:27,378
          YES, I DID.
     YOU LOOK VERY HEALTHY.

367
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:29,247
  YOU LOOK VERY WELL HYDRATED.

368
00:17:29,249 --> 00:17:30,782
 I JUST POSTED IT ON INSTAGRAM.

369
00:17:30,784 --> 00:17:32,650
  I HAVE 10,000 NEW FOLLOWERS.

370
00:17:32,652 --> 00:17:37,555
         LISTEN, I HAVE
      SOME VERY BIG NEWS.

371
00:17:37,557 --> 00:17:38,756
          WHAT IS IT?

372
00:17:38,758 --> 00:17:40,691
    I GAVE JULIE THE LETTER.

373
00:17:40,693 --> 00:17:43,761
        I'M FINALLY OUT,
       LIKE, REALLY OUT.

374
00:17:43,763 --> 00:17:46,064
           WAIT, WHY?
        WHAT DID YOU DO?

375
00:17:46,066 --> 00:17:47,765
     I GAVE HER THE LETTER.
     I TOLD HER EVERYTHING.

376
00:17:47,767 --> 00:17:49,434
             <i> WHAT?</i>

377
00:17:49,436 --> 00:17:50,635
    YOU KNOW, I DIDN'T THINK
     I WAS GOING TO BE ABLE

378
00:17:50,637 --> 00:17:52,370
 TO DO IT BUT I SAW THE MOMENT.

379
00:17:52,372 --> 00:17:54,572
  IT SORT OF PRESENTED ITSELF,
 AND THEN I WAS PRESENT FOR IT.

380
00:17:54,574 --> 00:17:56,541
 AND IT JUST KIND OF HAPPENED.

381
00:17:56,543 --> 00:17:58,776
 <i> SHE DIDN'T TAKE IT VERY WELL.</i>

382
00:17:58,778 --> 00:18:01,079
         BUT, YOU KNOW,
 THAT'S GOING TO BE HER THING.

383
00:18:01,081 --> 00:18:03,381
  I WANT TO BE A REAL COUPLE,
             OKAY?

384
00:18:03,383 --> 00:18:05,183
I WANT TO GO TO MOVIES WITH YOU

385
00:18:05,185 --> 00:18:07,118
   AND SIT AT THE SAME TABLE
         IN RESTAURANTS

386
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,553
      AND NOT HAVE TO FUCK
          IN THE BUSH.

387
00:18:08,555 --> 00:18:12,523
      - WHAT DO YOU THINK?
    - WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?

388
00:18:12,525 --> 00:18:16,260
 WELL, BECAUSE YOU TOLD ME THAT
YOU WANTED ME TO LEAVE MY WIFE.

389
00:18:16,262 --> 00:18:18,663
    YEAH, BUT I DIDN'T THINK
     YOU'D ACTUALLY DO IT.

390
00:18:18,665 --> 00:18:21,399
      GOD! WHO DOES THAT?
            GO BACK.

391
00:18:21,401 --> 00:18:23,734
     WELL, I CAN'T GO BACK.
   I JUST TOLD HER AND I'D--

392
00:18:23,736 --> 00:18:25,536
        GO BACK, EDWIN.

393
00:18:25,538 --> 00:18:28,606
      SHANNON, I LOVE YOU,
           ALL RIGHT?

394
00:18:28,608 --> 00:18:30,808
          I'M IN THIS.
   YOU'RE IN THIS TOO, RIGHT?

395
00:18:30,810 --> 00:18:33,177
  LOOK, I CAN'T TAKE THIS KIND
     OF PRESSURE RIGHT NOW.

396
00:18:33,179 --> 00:18:34,846
     HUH? WHAT DO YOU MEAN
        YOU CAN'T TAKE--

397
00:18:34,848 --> 00:18:37,281
     <i> I'M NOT WHAT-- WHAT?</i>

398
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:05,510
     HEY, CAN YOU COME BACK
             IN 10?

399
00:19:05,512 --> 00:19:07,345
      DO YOU WANT TO FUCK?

400
00:19:07,347 --> 00:19:09,447
          HEY, ALICIA,
      IT'S MARTHA CALLING.

401
00:19:09,449 --> 00:19:12,283
       I WAS JUST CALLING

402
00:19:12,285 --> 00:19:14,552
    BECAUSE I DIDN'T SEE YOU
     AT THE GYM LAST NIGHT

403
00:19:14,554 --> 00:19:17,822
         AND THAT MAKES
       ME REALLY WORRIED.

404
00:19:18,925 --> 00:19:20,791
       YOU CALL ME CHAMP,

405
00:19:20,793 --> 00:19:22,527
   AND I'LL FUCK YOU SO HARD
   YOU'LL COME OUT YOUR BUTT.

406
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:28,666
 I THOUGHT ABOUT WHAT YOU SAID

407
00:19:28,668 --> 00:19:30,768
  AND I TOLD HER THAT YOU CAN
 ONLY STAY FOR TWO MORE WEEKS.

408
00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:35,406
 I MEAN, I HAVEN'T TOLD HER YET
BUT I'M GOING TO TELL HER, SO...

409
00:19:35,408 --> 00:19:37,441
  BUT IT WOULD BE REALLY GREAT
       TO YOU ABOUT THAT.

410
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:47,318
      GO-- GO TO THE BED.

411
00:19:51,790 --> 00:19:54,692
  UH, I MEAN, I KNOW YOU SAID
    YOU DIDN'T WANT TO TALK.

412
00:19:54,694 --> 00:19:58,863
 SO, IF YOU FEEL LIKE IT, OKAY?

413
00:19:58,865 --> 00:20:00,431
       SO, I DON'T KNOW,

414
00:20:00,433 --> 00:20:02,600
MAYBE WE CAN HANG OUT AGAIN SOON
          OR SOMETHING

415
00:20:02,602 --> 00:20:05,836
  OR JUST CALL ME OR TEXT ME.

416
00:20:09,441 --> 00:20:10,608
          - GET DOWN.
            - OKAY.

417
00:20:10,610 --> 00:20:12,376
             YEAH.

418
00:20:12,378 --> 00:20:14,212
         GONNA GET IT.

419
00:20:14,214 --> 00:20:15,913
           OKAY, BYE.

420
00:20:40,839 --> 00:20:42,740
            SHANNON?

421
00:20:54,721 --> 00:20:56,621
            SHANNON?

422
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:02,860
         HOUSEKEEPING.

423
00:21:17,777 --> 00:21:19,677
       FIRE! FIRE! FIRE!

424
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:20,945
    WHAT THE? WHAT THE FUCK?

425
00:21:20,947 --> 00:21:23,681
            - FIRE!
   - GET OFF--GET OFF OF HER.

426
00:21:23,683 --> 00:21:24,682
             SHAN!

427
00:21:24,684 --> 00:21:26,384
        YOU WERE RIGHT.

428
00:21:26,386 --> 00:21:29,687
          - TAG TEAM!
   - GET AWAY FROM MY LITTLE
            SISTER!

429
00:21:29,689 --> 00:21:31,489
   YOU STILL HAVE YOUR PUSSY,
             BABY.

430
00:21:31,491 --> 00:21:32,823
     JUMP BACK ON MY DICK.

431
00:21:32,825 --> 00:21:33,991
YOU'RE A DISGUSTING
         PIECE OF SHIT.

432
00:21:37,929 --> 00:21:39,730
             SHAN!

433
00:21:39,732 --> 00:21:40,998
       NO, NO, NO, SHAN.

434
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,533
  GOD, WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?

435
00:21:42,535 --> 00:21:44,902
    WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?

436
00:21:44,904 --> 00:21:47,738
WHAT THE FUCK WERE YOU THINKING?
      WHAT THE FUCK, SHAN?

437
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:48,806
             - GOD.
            - OKAY.

438
00:21:48,808 --> 00:21:49,807
         - OH, MY GOD.
         - OKAY. OKAY.

439
00:21:49,809 --> 00:21:53,744
      OKAY. OKAY. SHANNON.

440
00:21:53,746 --> 00:21:57,348
  IS HE DEAD? HOLY SHIT, SHIT.

441
00:21:57,350 --> 00:21:58,416
       HE'S DEAD SHANNON.

442
00:21:58,418 --> 00:22:00,017
    DID I JUST KILL SOMEONE?

443
00:22:00,019 --> 00:22:02,687
  I DON'T HEAR ANYTHING, SHAN.

444
00:22:02,689 --> 00:22:03,988
DID I JUST FUCKING KILL SOMEONE?

445
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:05,623
         CALM, BE CALM.

446
00:22:05,625 --> 00:22:07,625
         - OH, MY GOD.
 - OKAY. IT'S GOING TO BE OKAY.

447
00:22:07,627 --> 00:22:10,494
     WHAT AM I GOING TO DO?
    WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO?

448
00:22:10,496 --> 00:22:11,829
   HE WAS RAPING YOU, RIGHT?

449
00:22:11,831 --> 00:22:13,631
             - YES.
        - RIGHT? RAPING?

450
00:22:13,633 --> 00:22:15,633
           100% RAPE.

451
00:22:15,635 --> 00:22:17,435
       THAT'S WAS A RAPE.

452
00:22:17,437 --> 00:22:20,471
         HE WAS RAPING
      THE SHIT OUT OF ME.

453
00:22:20,473 --> 00:22:22,707
 OKAY, THEN HE WAS RAPING YOU.

454
00:22:22,709 --> 00:22:24,642
   WHAT ARE YOU DOING? WHAT?
  MARTHA! WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

     WHAT? ARE YOU CALLING
        THE FRONT DESK?

00:22:32,352 --> 00:22:33,484
        I'M TELLING THEM

460
00:22:33,486 --> 00:22:35,486
        NO, YOU'RE NOT.

00:22:35,488 --> 00:22:37,054
             HELLO?

463
00:22:40,526 --> 00:22:42,860
            - JERRY?
  - YEAH, HE WOULD LOVE JAIL.

464
00:22:42,862 --> 00:22:44,462
     IT'S VERY STRUCTURED.

465
00:22:44,464 --> 00:22:45,596
       HE'D MAKE FRIENDS.

466
00:22:45,598 --> 00:22:47,131
             HELLO?

467
00:22:47,133 --> 00:22:49,400
      DO YOU WANT ME TO GO
            TO JAIL?

468
00:22:49,402 --> 00:22:51,135
       NO, OF COURSE NOT.

469
00:22:51,137 --> 00:22:52,937
 IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT? 'CAUSE
   LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING,
            MARTHA.

470
00:22:52,939 --> 00:22:55,506
       I AM A REGISTERED
         SEX OFFENDER.

471
00:22:55,508 --> 00:22:56,574
    DO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT?

472
00:22:56,576 --> 00:22:58,609
      HOW DO I PROVE THAT
          HE RAPED ME?

473
00:22:58,611 --> 00:23:00,478
       I NEED YOUR HELP.

474
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,580
             FINE.

478
00:23:10,857 --> 00:23:12,690
             HELLO?

479
00:23:12,692 --> 00:23:15,126
     HELLO? THIS IS KRISTEN
      FROM THE FRONT DESK.

00:23:15,128 --> 00:23:17,094
  IS EVERYTHING OKAY IN THERE?

00:23:17,096 --> 00:23:18,763
    CAN YOU OPEN UP, PLEASE?

482
00:23:18,765 --> 00:23:23,100
         BY LAW I NEED
   TO CHECK WHAT IS GOING ON.

483
00:23:23,102 --> 00:23:24,668
CAN I HELP YOU?

484
00:23:24,670 --> 00:23:26,504
           LET ME IN.
   WHAT'S GOING ON IN THERE?

485
00:23:26,506 --> 00:23:28,005
  NOTHING. I'M JUST CLEANING.

486
00:23:28,007 --> 00:23:29,740
    OH REALLY? 'CAUSE I GOT
        A STRANGE CALL.

487
00:23:29,742 --> 00:23:31,108
    IT SOUNDED LIKE A FIGHT
         OR SOMETHING.

488
00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:33,544
      NO, I'M JUST REALLY
      INTENSELY CLEANING.

489
00:23:33,546 --> 00:23:34,912
   IT'S REALLY DIRTY IN HERE.

490
00:23:34,914 --> 00:23:37,047
      OKAY, LISTEN TO ME,
     IF YOU WERE CALLING ME

491
00:23:37,049 --> 00:23:39,150
   AND YOU WERE PRANKING ME,
      LIKE IN HIGH SCHOOL,

492
00:23:39,152 --> 00:23:40,951
        THAT IS GROUNDS
   FOR DISMISSAL HERE, MISSY.

493
00:23:40,953 --> 00:23:43,721
    AND I AM SURE THAT JERRY
  WOULD LOVE TO HEAR ABOUT IT.

494
00:23:43,723 --> 00:23:45,623
  WELL, THEN WHY DON'T YOU GO
     AND TELL HIM, KRISTEN?

495
00:23:45,625 --> 00:23:46,891
     GOOD, I'M TEXTING HIM
  RIGHT NOW WITH MY OTHER HAND

496
00:23:46,893 --> 00:23:48,058
      THAT YOU CAN'T SEE.

497
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:50,461
- WHATEVER.
        - NO.

498
00:23:55,667 --> 00:23:56,767
       WE NEED TO HURRY.
        JERRY'S COMING.

499
00:23:56,769 --> 00:23:58,569
            - OKAY.
       - WHAT DID YOU DO?

500
00:23:58,571 --> 00:23:59,804
   I'M JUST BEING RESPECTFUL.
   HE DESERVES SOME DIGNITY.

501
00:23:59,806 --> 00:24:01,071
       EVERYONE DESERVES
         SOME DIGNITY.

502
00:24:01,073 --> 00:24:03,941
        - EVEN RAPISTS?
      - YES, EVEN RAPISTS.

503
00:24:03,943 --> 00:24:05,709
             OKAY.

504
00:24:05,711 --> 00:24:06,877
          PULL HARDER.

505
00:24:16,955 --> 00:24:18,823
     HEADING TO 400, COPY.

506
00:24:18,825 --> 00:24:20,191
   OVER AND OUT, GOOD BUDDY.

507
00:24:35,073 --> 00:24:36,707
WHERE ARE WE TAKING HIM?

508
00:24:36,709 --> 00:24:38,476
THE PRESIDENTIAL
        SUITE IS EMPTY.

509
00:24:45,184 --> 00:24:47,084
          LUNCH TIME.

510
00:24:51,656 --> 00:24:52,790
     GOOD MORNING, LADIES.

511
00:24:58,630 --> 00:25:00,197
      SORRY. I DON'T KNOW
       WHY SHE'S BARKING.

512
00:25:00,199 --> 00:25:02,099
          SHIT SHEETS.

513
00:25:02,101 --> 00:25:04,535
     THE SHEETS ARE FILLED
        WITH SHIT. YEAH.

514
00:25:04,537 --> 00:25:05,669
    SOMEONE HAD AN ACCIDENT.

515
00:25:05,671 --> 00:25:06,904
       A BACHELOR PARTY.

516
00:25:06,906 --> 00:25:08,772
        HAVE A GOOD DAY.
     ENJOY YOUR STAY HERE.

517
00:25:14,145 --> 00:25:16,947
   SHIT. HE LIVES IN FRESNO.

518
00:25:16,949 --> 00:25:19,116
      HOPE HE DOESN'T HAVE
          FAMILY HERE

519
00:25:19,118 --> 00:25:21,118
      AND THEY DON'T COME
        LOOKING FOR HIM.

520
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:23,687
     MAYBE HE DOESN'T HAVE
    ANY FAMILY. OUR PARENTS
           ARE DEAD.

521
00:25:23,689 --> 00:25:26,757
  YOU ARE THE ONLY PERSON WHO
WOULD TURN THAT INTO A POSITIVE.

522
00:25:26,759 --> 00:25:28,225
         LOOK AT THIS.

523
00:25:28,227 --> 00:25:31,562
 DUDE WON A BRONZE IN BEIJING.

524
00:25:31,564 --> 00:25:33,197
    YOU KILLED AN OLYMPIAN.

525
00:25:33,199 --> 00:25:36,767
  ONLY IF YOU CONSIDER HAMMER
     THROW A SPORT WHICH--

526
00:25:37,837 --> 00:25:39,036
          OH NO. FUCK!

527
00:25:39,038 --> 00:25:40,704
WHO WOULD CALL HIM?

528
00:25:40,706 --> 00:25:42,139
     FUCK! IT'S HIS SISTER.

529
00:25:42,141 --> 00:25:43,807
   OKAY, JUST GIVE IT TO ME.

530
00:25:43,809 --> 00:25:45,943
     I'LL JUST LET IT GO TO
    VOICE MAIL, THEN WE'LL--

531
00:25:45,945 --> 00:25:47,912
<i> HELLO?</i>

532
00:25:47,914 --> 00:25:50,080
     -<i> I KNOW YOU'RE THERE.</i>
   - IT'S A REALLY OLD PHONE.

533
00:25:50,082 --> 00:25:52,116
       - I DIDN'T KNOW.
            -<i> HELLO?</i>

534
00:25:53,752 --> 00:25:59,223
 YOU HAVE REACHED THE VOICEMAIL
           BOX OF...

535
00:25:59,225 --> 00:26:04,995
         BORIS LIP-KA.

536
00:26:04,997 --> 00:26:08,165
  AT THE TONE LEAVE A MESSAGE.

537
00:26:08,167 --> 00:26:12,570
             BEEP!

538
00:26:12,572 --> 00:26:14,271
         <i> HEY. IT'S ME.</i>

539
00:26:14,273 --> 00:26:16,206
    <i> I KNOW YOU'RE PROBABLY</i>
<i> JERKING OFF IN YOUR HOTEL ROOM</i>

540
00:26:16,208 --> 00:26:18,342
     <i> LIKE A DISGUSTING PIG</i>
          <i> RIGHT NOW,</i>

541
00:26:18,344 --> 00:26:21,312
   <i> BUT YOU BETTER COME HOME</i>
<i>FOR DAD'S BIRTHDAY PARTY TODAY.</i>

542
00:26:21,314 --> 00:26:24,048
    <i> I'M SO FUCKING SICK OF</i>
    <i> DEALING WITH THESE TWO</i>
      <i> INVALIDS ON MY OWN!</i>

543
00:26:24,050 --> 00:26:26,250
  <i> YOU BETTER BE HERE BY 3:00</i>

544
00:26:26,252 --> 00:26:28,719
   <i> OR I SWEAR I'LL COME GET</i>
          <i> YOU MYSELF.</i>

545
00:26:28,721 --> 00:26:33,123
   OKAY, SO THEY'RE NOT CLOSE
 AND HIS PARENTS ARE INVALIDS.

546
00:26:33,125 --> 00:26:34,658
 I FEEL LIKE THIS IS GOOD NEWS.

547
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:35,993
    WHEN HE DOESN'T SHOW UP
            AT 3:00

548
00:26:35,995 --> 00:26:38,829
      HIS SISTER IS GOING
    TO COME LOOKING FOR HIM.

549
00:26:38,831 --> 00:26:41,966
    WHAT IF WE DUMP HIS BODY
       AT DRY CREEK CANAL

550
00:26:41,968 --> 00:26:43,233
  AND MAKE IT LOOK A SUICIDE?

551
00:26:43,235 --> 00:26:45,069
           ISN'T THAT
  WHERE EVERYONE DUMPS BODIES?

552
00:26:45,071 --> 00:26:46,971
  HOW ARE WE GOING TO DO THAT?

553
00:27:02,821 --> 00:27:04,722
           OF COURSE,
  THE RAPIST HAS A RAPIST VAN.

554
00:27:04,724 --> 00:27:05,923
         LET'S HURRY UP
     AND GET HIM IN THERE.

555
00:27:13,331 --> 00:27:16,300
   LOOK, SHAN, HE WAS TRYING
      TO BE A GOOD PERSON.

556
00:27:16,302 --> 00:27:17,735
       HE WAS IN TO YOGA.

557
00:27:17,737 --> 00:27:19,336
        WE CAN STILL GO
         TO THE POLICE.

558
00:27:19,338 --> 00:27:20,838
        WE'RE NOT GOING
      TO THE POLICE, OKAY?

559
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:23,273
     WE'RE DUMPING THE BODY
         AT DRY CREEK.

560
00:27:23,275 --> 00:27:25,876
UNLESS YOU CAN FIND HIS PARENTS'
     ADDRESS IN HIS PHONE.

561
00:27:25,878 --> 00:27:27,277
     AND THEN-- THEN WHAT?

562
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:29,847
 JUST PUT HIM ON THE DOORSTEP,
         RING THE BELL?

563
00:27:29,849 --> 00:27:32,049
        "HAPPY BIRTHDAY!
     HERE'S YOUR DEAD SON."

564
00:27:32,051 --> 00:27:34,118
     CALM DOWN, ALL RIGHT?

565
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:36,420
           CALM DOWN.

566
00:27:36,422 --> 00:27:39,423
JUST FIGURE OUT A DIFFERENT WAY
  TO MAKE HIS BODY DISAPPEAR.

567
00:27:39,425 --> 00:27:41,091
       GIVE ME THE PHONE.
      JUST GIVE IT TO ME.

568
00:27:44,696 --> 00:27:47,164
     ALL RIGHT, HERE IT IS.

569
00:27:47,166 --> 00:27:49,700
     MOM AND DAD'S ADDRESS,
         BOOM AND BOOM.

570
00:27:49,702 --> 00:27:51,969
       WHAT ARE WE GOING
    TO DO WHEN WE GET THERE?

571
00:27:51,971 --> 00:27:53,871
         I HAVE A PLAN.

572
00:28:05,884 --> 00:28:08,285
USE YOUR KEY!

573
00:28:09,287 --> 00:28:12,089
          WHO ARE YOU?

574
00:28:12,091 --> 00:28:13,991
    I'M A FRIEND OF BORIS'S,
   AS YOU MUST BE HIS SISTER.

575
00:28:13,993 --> 00:28:15,793
          - YES, I AM.
       - I'M HIS FRIEND.

576
00:28:15,795 --> 00:28:17,761
       BORIS DOESN'T HAVE
          ANY FRIENDS.

577
00:28:17,763 --> 00:28:20,731
         I'M HIS SISTER
  AND I'M NOT EVEN HIS FRIEND.

578
00:28:20,733 --> 00:28:22,099
             WELL--

579
00:28:29,974 --> 00:28:32,910
           - WELL--
         - WHERE IS HE?

580
00:28:32,912 --> 00:28:39,817
   UH...HE'S-- BORIS IS MORE
      THAN A FRIEND TO ME.
       I'M HIS LIFE GURU.

581
00:28:39,819 --> 00:28:42,352
       OH, THIS IS GOOD.
 SO HE'S GOT A LIFE COACH NOW?

582
00:28:42,354 --> 00:28:43,420
             GURU.

583
00:28:43,422 --> 00:28:44,822
           OH, GURU.

584
00:28:44,824 --> 00:28:46,290
            - YEAH.
         - INTERESTING.

585
00:28:46,292 --> 00:28:47,858
     SO WHAT KIND OF STUFF
     DO YOU ADVISE HIM ON?

586
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:49,326
      THE BEST PROSTITUTES
            TO FUCK?

587
00:28:49,328 --> 00:28:50,961
    I CAN SEE WHY YOU WOULD
            SAY THAT

588
00:28:50,963 --> 00:28:53,997
 AND THAT HAS BEEN HIS PAINFUL
     REALITY FOR SOME TIME,

589
00:28:53,999 --> 00:28:55,733
         BUT I'M HOPING
   WITH MY HELP AND GUIDANCE

590
00:28:55,735 --> 00:28:59,169
  WE CAN MOVE HIM THROUGH THAT
   AND I CAN HELP HIM CHANGE.

591
00:28:59,171 --> 00:29:01,004
       WELL, IT'S TOO BAD
      THAT HE WASN'T HERE

592
00:29:01,006 --> 00:29:03,507
          TO HELP ME
      WHEN I WAS CHANGING
      POP'S DIAPERS, HUH?

593
00:29:03,509 --> 00:29:05,109
       COULDN'T HELP HIM
   WITH THAT I GUESS, RIGHT?

594
00:29:05,111 --> 00:29:06,977
 ARE YOU FEELING A LOT OF PAIN?

595
00:29:06,979 --> 00:29:08,245
             - YES.
        - CAN I COME IN?

596
00:29:10,215 --> 00:29:13,083
         OKAY, COME IN.

597
00:29:16,255 --> 00:29:17,955
          GURU, GURU.

598
00:29:17,957 --> 00:29:18,956
YES, I'M A--

599
00:29:18,958 --> 00:29:21,892
          GURU, GURU.

600
00:29:21,894 --> 00:29:23,794
GURU.

601
00:29:25,897 --> 00:29:29,933
       GURU, GURU, GURU.

602
00:29:36,308 --> 00:29:38,976
         SO I'M HERE TO
        REPRESENT BORIS.

603
00:29:38,978 --> 00:29:42,980
            AND HE--
 HE HAS COME TO THE REALIZATION

604
00:29:42,982 --> 00:29:45,115
    THAT HE HAS BEEN LIVING
          IN THE PAST.

605
00:29:45,117 --> 00:29:48,118
      AND ALTHOUGH WINNING
    AN OLYMPIC BRONZE MEDAL

606
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:50,020
  IS A MAJOR LIFE ACHIEVEMENT,

607
00:29:50,022 --> 00:29:52,790
        HE'S NEVER BEEN
 ABLE TO REALLY MOVE PAST THIS.

608
00:29:52,792 --> 00:29:59,229
    SO WE'VE DECIDED THAT'S
  IT'S DUE TO FEAR OF FAILURE.

609
00:29:59,231 --> 00:30:00,831
    HE'S AFRAID OF FAILING!

610
00:30:04,469 --> 00:30:07,404
   SO WE'VE DECIDED THE BEST
        THING FOR BORIS

611
00:30:07,406 --> 00:30:12,209
 RIGHT NOW IN ORDER FOR HIM TO
 START OVER IS TO LEAVE FRESNO
            FOREVER.

612
00:30:12,211 --> 00:30:14,211
    TO NEVER EVER COME BACK,

613
00:30:14,213 --> 00:30:17,247
       TO SEVER ALL TIES
        WITH HIS FAMILY

614
00:30:17,249 --> 00:30:20,284
     AND TO NEVER EVER TALK
         TO YOU AGAIN.

615
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:30,561
  THIS IS WHAT I HAVE TO DEAL
       WITH ALL DAY LONG.

616
00:30:30,563 --> 00:30:35,265
          HE REQUESTED
 THAT I GIVE YOU HIS BACKPACK.

617
00:30:57,856 --> 00:31:01,491
  BORIS, DON'T LEAVE ME HERE!

618
00:31:01,493 --> 00:31:04,394
       BORIS IS SO SORRY
          THAT HE HAS
      TO LEAVE THE FAMILY,

619
00:31:04,396 --> 00:31:05,629
          BUT HE KNOWS
       IT'S THE ONLY WAY

620
00:31:05,631 --> 00:31:07,064
     HE'S GOING TO BE ABLE
          TO GROW UP.

621
00:31:08,567 --> 00:31:10,467
             POOPY!

622
00:31:11,936 --> 00:31:13,637
          YOU BETTER--

623
00:31:16,341 --> 00:31:17,541
    YOU THINK SHE BOUGHT IT?

624
00:31:17,543 --> 00:31:19,443
          I THINK SO.
      BUT THIS WILL HELP.

625
00:31:20,945 --> 00:31:22,512
           "SELL THIS
     AND GET OUT OF FRESNO.

626
00:31:22,514 --> 00:31:25,983
          I LOVE YOU.
       BUT I CAN'T CHANGE
        ANOTHER DIAPER."

627
00:31:25,985 --> 00:31:27,584
        X-O-X-O, BORIS.

628
00:31:27,586 --> 00:31:30,320
       YEAH, SOUNDS GOOD.

629
00:31:30,322 --> 00:31:32,456
  WHAT SHOULD WE DO WITH HIM?
 SHOULD WE JUST LEAVE HIM HERE?

630
00:31:32,458 --> 00:31:35,893
          NO, DUMBASS
       WE SHOULD ROLL HIM
       BACK TO THE HOTEL

631
00:31:35,895 --> 00:31:37,294
   AND FIGURE SOMETHING OUT.

632
00:31:37,296 --> 00:31:39,229
           GOD, SHAN,
        DO YOU JUST HAVE
     TO SMOKE ALL THE TIME?

633
00:31:39,231 --> 00:31:41,098
           YES, I DO.

634
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:42,299
           YOU KNOW,
     WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF
   A SERIOUS DROUGHT, RIGHT?

635
00:31:42,301 --> 00:31:44,101
              YES.

636
00:31:44,103 --> 00:31:46,336
      I MEAN, DO YOU JUST
      WANT THE WHOLE PLACE
      TO GO UP IN FLAMES?

637
00:31:46,338 --> 00:31:50,173
   ACTUALLY, YEAH. THAT WOULD
   KIND OF SOLVE OUR PROBLEM,
     IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT.

638
00:31:52,043 --> 00:31:54,177
    WE KNOW SOMEBODY WHO HAS
   A PLACE RIGHT AROUND HERE.

639
00:31:54,179 --> 00:31:56,179
             WE DO?

640
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:02,119
            GERALD?

641
00:32:02,121 --> 00:32:03,387
     WHAT THE FUCK, MARTHA.

642
00:32:03,389 --> 00:32:05,589
       BE QUIET AND ADMIT
       IT'S A GOOD IDEA.

643
00:32:05,591 --> 00:32:08,258
    ALL RIGHT. AND YOU WERE
  SAYING THE BREED WAS A DANE?

644
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:09,927
          GREAT DANE.

645
00:32:09,929 --> 00:32:11,695
         - A GREAT ONE?
- YEAH, THAT'S WHY HE'S SO BIG.

646
00:32:11,697 --> 00:32:12,963
          OKAY. SO...

647
00:32:17,635 --> 00:32:19,670
        YOU DO REMEMBER?

648
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:23,607
    COME ON, MAN. MY SISTER.

649
00:32:23,609 --> 00:32:25,008
           I'M SORRY.

650
00:32:25,010 --> 00:32:26,443
    - HEY, WHAT'S GOING ON?
             - HEY.

651
00:32:26,445 --> 00:32:28,078
              HEY.

652
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:29,680
 THESE ARE OLD FRIENDS OF MINE,
      SHANNON AND MARTHA.

653
00:32:29,682 --> 00:32:31,682
   IS THIS THE SCOOTER GIRL?

654
00:32:31,684 --> 00:32:33,383
     HOW DID YOU KNOW THAT?

655
00:32:33,385 --> 00:32:35,619
     YOU TOLD ME ABOUT HER
   ON ONE OF OUR FIRST DATES.

656
00:32:35,621 --> 00:32:37,087
        WOW. YOU REALLY
         LISTEN TO ME.

657
00:32:37,089 --> 00:32:38,488
        I LISTEN TO YOU
      WHEN YOU TALK, BABY.

658
00:32:38,490 --> 00:32:40,257
  BUT YOU LOOK THE OTHER WAY.
        IT'S INCREDIBLE.

659
00:32:40,259 --> 00:32:41,591
             YEAH.

660
00:32:41,593 --> 00:32:43,493
       WHAT'S IN THE BIN?

661
00:32:43,495 --> 00:32:46,330
  REALLY HOPE IT'S A DEAD DOG
 BECAUSE WE COULD USE THE CASH.

662
00:32:46,332 --> 00:32:48,198
  SENSITIVITY, HONEY, PLEASE.

663
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:50,667
   I'M SORRY. WE REALLY HOPE
  IT'S YOUR DEAD DOG. PLEASE?

664
00:32:50,669 --> 00:32:52,269
         THAT'S BORIS.
      HE JUST PASSED AWAY,

665
00:32:52,271 --> 00:32:54,204
        SO WE'RE HOPING
      TO GET HIM CREMATED.

666
00:32:54,206 --> 00:32:56,106
      GERALD WAS SAYING WE
     COULD HAVE THE FRIENDS
    AND MY FAMILY DISCOUNT.

667
00:32:56,108 --> 00:32:58,008
           I'M SORRY.

668
00:32:58,010 --> 00:33:01,278
           YOU KNOW,
       THIS IS THE REASON
     WHY WE'RE STUCK HERE.

669
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:03,747
     THIS, BULLSHIT FRIENDS
       AND FAMILY THING.

670
00:33:03,749 --> 00:33:07,384
      NOT EVERYONE IS YOUR
       FAMILY AND ALMOST
     NO ONE IS YOUR FRIEND.

671
00:33:07,386 --> 00:33:09,519
          CAN WE WALK
      AROUND THE CEMETERY
    AND DO THIS. IT'S JUST--

672
00:33:09,521 --> 00:33:13,757
       WE ALSO-- WE NEED
  TO GET THE BIN CREMATED TOO.

673
00:33:13,759 --> 00:33:16,760
     THERE ARE NO DISCOUNTS
     AND THE BIN IS EXTRA.

674
00:33:16,762 --> 00:33:19,062
          THAT'S FINE.

675
00:33:19,064 --> 00:33:20,731
          WE CAN PAY.

676
00:33:20,733 --> 00:33:22,532
             OKAY.
   HAND ME THE TAPE MEASURE.

677
00:33:22,534 --> 00:33:24,468
FOR WHAT? WHY DO YOU NEED THE--
 WHY DO NEED THE TAPE MEASURE?

678
00:33:24,470 --> 00:33:26,036
 - WE HAVE TO MEASURE FOR THE--
       - WE ALREADY KNOW.

679
00:33:26,038 --> 00:33:27,337
      NO, WE MEASURED HIM.

680
00:33:27,339 --> 00:33:28,638
     IT'S THE AVERAGE SIZE
        OF A GREAT DANE.

681
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:30,073
        IT'S FIVE FOOT,
     SOMETHING, SOMETHING.

682
00:33:30,075 --> 00:33:32,409
         JUST CHARGE US
      A GREAT DANE PRICE.

683
00:33:32,411 --> 00:33:34,144
    THE EXTRA, EXTRA LARGE.
           IT'S FINE.

684
00:33:34,146 --> 00:33:36,046
     - YOU GUYS CAN LEAVE.
- YOU DON'T HAVE TO MEASURE HIM.

685
00:33:36,048 --> 00:33:38,015
- YOU DON'T HAVE TO MEASURE HIM.
    - I HAVE TO MEASURE HIM.

686
00:33:39,018 --> 00:33:40,751
         WHAT THE FUCK?

687
00:33:40,753 --> 00:33:42,652
   WE SAID DON'T MEASURE IT!

688
00:33:48,726 --> 00:33:50,560
           I'M SORRY.
   WE NEED TO CALL THE COPS.

689
00:33:50,562 --> 00:33:51,795
           WHAT FOR?

690
00:33:51,797 --> 00:33:53,397
        - I'M WITH RUBY.
           - SHUT UP.

691
00:33:53,399 --> 00:33:55,265
       WE OWN A BUSINESS,
           ALL RIGHT?

692
00:33:55,267 --> 00:33:57,501
    WE CAN LOSE EVERYTHING!
 THERE'S A HUMAN BODY IN HERE.

693
00:33:57,503 --> 00:33:59,302
    I UNDERSTAND THAT, OKAY?
            LISTEN.

694
00:33:59,304 --> 00:34:01,304
   - DO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT?
          - YES, I DO.

695
00:34:01,306 --> 00:34:03,640
     WELL, I'M THE BUSINESS
       PERSON HERE, OKAY?

696
00:34:03,642 --> 00:34:05,776
          WE AGREED--
       WE AGREED ON THAT.

697
00:34:05,778 --> 00:34:08,145
    AND I SAY WE DON'T CALL
           THE COPS.

698
00:34:08,147 --> 00:34:09,780
  BECAUSE IF WE CALL THE COPS,
    WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN?

699
00:34:09,782 --> 00:34:11,715
      NOTHING'S GOING TO--
    THEY'RE GOING TO GO JAIL

700
00:34:11,717 --> 00:34:13,283
      AND WE'RE NOT GOING
        TO GET ANYTHING.

701
00:34:13,285 --> 00:34:14,451
           NO REWARD.

702
00:34:14,453 --> 00:34:15,652
            I MEAN,
     YOU THINK THAT THE GUY

703
00:34:15,654 --> 00:34:17,120
   WHO FOUND THE SLAVE GIRLS
            IN OHIO?

704
00:34:17,122 --> 00:34:18,221
            - OHIO?
        - ARIEL CASTRO.

705
00:34:18,223 --> 00:34:19,589
       YEAH. DO YOU THINK
        THAT THAT GUY--

706
00:34:19,591 --> 00:34:22,092
      DID HE GET ANYTHING?
       BECAUSE HE DIDN'T.

707
00:34:22,094 --> 00:34:23,727
           NO. UH-UH.

708
00:34:23,729 --> 00:34:25,829
      HE GOT, LIKE, A HUG
    FROM A LITTLE WHITE GIRL

709
00:34:25,831 --> 00:34:27,497
        AND THEN HE GOT,

710
00:34:27,499 --> 00:34:28,732
LIKE, AN EMBARRASSING INTERVIEW
      LIKE GOT AUTO-TUNED

711
00:34:28,734 --> 00:34:29,833
          AND, LIKE,
     PUT ALL OVER YOUTUBE.

712
00:34:29,835 --> 00:34:31,268
    THAT'S NOT WHAT WE WANT.

713
00:34:31,270 --> 00:34:32,602
        NO, NOT AT ALL.

714
00:34:32,604 --> 00:34:35,572
    WE'RE GOING TO BLACKMAIL
       THESE TWO BITCHES.

715
00:34:35,574 --> 00:34:37,107
        ARE YOU KIDDING?

716
00:34:37,109 --> 00:34:39,576
         WE WANT 25,000
 TO GET OUT OF THIS BUTT CRACK

717
00:34:39,578 --> 00:34:40,677
   AND WE WANT IT BY SUNDAY.

718
00:34:40,679 --> 00:34:42,546
WHAT?

719
00:34:42,548 --> 00:34:44,114
 THERE'S NO WAY WE CAN COME UP
    WITH 25K IN THREE DAYS.

720
00:34:44,116 --> 00:34:45,449
        WE'RE IN FRESNO.

721
00:34:45,451 --> 00:34:47,584
            - YEAH.
   - I'M PRETTY SURE YOU CAN.

722
00:34:47,586 --> 00:34:50,854
   YOU SEEM VERY RESOURCEFUL.
     SO THREE DAYS, 25,000.

723
00:34:50,856 --> 00:34:52,556
             - 25?
     - WE CAN GO TO DETROIT
           WITH THAT.

724
00:34:52,558 --> 00:34:54,124
     WE COULD DEFINITELY GO
          TO DETROIT.

725
00:34:54,126 --> 00:34:56,126
      WE COULD MOVE THERE
    AND WE SET UP SHOP AND--

726
00:34:56,128 --> 00:34:58,495
    AND GUESS WHAT, YOU GET
     A CREMATION OUT OF IT.

727
00:34:58,497 --> 00:34:59,696
    YOU KNOW HOW GOOD WE ARE
         AT CREMATION?

728
00:34:59,698 --> 00:35:01,331
   WE'RE REALLY GOOD AT THEM.

729
00:35:01,333 --> 00:35:03,233
       A FUNERAL SERVICE
   LIKE YOU WILL NOT BELIEVE.

730
00:35:03,235 --> 00:35:05,869
  BUT, YOU KNOW, IF YOU DON'T
       GET THE MONEY THEN

731
00:35:05,871 --> 00:35:10,240
 YOU'RE GOING TO BE CHARGED FOR
 MANSLAUGHTER, SO THERE'S THAT.

732
00:35:10,242 --> 00:35:11,541
   WHAT ABOUT A PAYMENT PLAN?

733
00:35:11,543 --> 00:35:12,609
     NOBODY EVEN HAS THAT.

734
00:35:12,611 --> 00:35:14,311
            LAYAWAY?

735
00:35:14,313 --> 00:35:16,513
  CAN I GIVE YOU A LITTLE BIT
  ADVICE AS FAR AS BODIES GO?

736
00:35:16,515 --> 00:35:20,484
    THAT GUY IS GOING TO ROT
  IF YOU DON'T GET HIM ON ICE.

737
00:35:20,486 --> 00:35:21,785
  THAT'S ALL. IT JUST HAPPENS.

738
00:35:21,787 --> 00:35:24,788
         IT'S BIOLOGY.

739
00:35:24,790 --> 00:35:27,290
    WHAT A STUPID ASS IDEA.

740
00:35:27,292 --> 00:35:28,592
            GERALD.

741
00:35:28,594 --> 00:35:30,460
    COME ON, HE BURNS THINGS
      FOR A LIVING, OKAY?

742
00:35:30,462 --> 00:35:33,363
    FOR $25,000! AND THEY'LL
   PROBABLY STILL TURN US IN.

743
00:35:33,365 --> 00:35:34,564
   THEY'RE NOT TURNING US IN.

744
00:35:34,566 --> 00:35:36,500
     SHE SAID SHE WANTS OUT
           OF FRESNO.

745
00:35:36,502 --> 00:35:39,870
      THE ONLY WAY TO GET
      25K IS DEALING DRUGS
        OR PROSTITUTION.

746
00:35:41,506 --> 00:35:43,673
     I JUST PAID THOUSANDS
      TO PUT YOU IN REHAB

747
00:35:43,675 --> 00:35:45,242
     AND I DOUBLE MORTGAGED
           MY HOUSE.

748
00:35:45,244 --> 00:35:47,577
      YOU'RE NOT BECOMING
         A PROSTITUTE.

749
00:35:47,579 --> 00:35:49,679
      I'M NOT HAVING SEX.
       I'LL BE YOUR PIMP.

750
00:35:49,681 --> 00:35:51,548
        I'M NOT TOUCHING
         SWEATY BALLS!

751
00:35:51,550 --> 00:35:53,650
   THEY'RE NOT ALWAYS SWEATY.

752
00:35:53,652 --> 00:35:56,520
      JUST PRETEND THEY'RE
       TINY LITTLE BOOBS.

753
00:35:56,522 --> 00:35:58,188
           OKAY FINE.
        WHAT ABOUT THIS?

754
00:35:58,190 --> 00:36:00,390
        WHAT IF WE PULL
         THE FIRE ALARM
          IN THE HOTEL

755
00:36:00,392 --> 00:36:01,725
          AND STEAL IT
      FROM THE FRONT DESK?

756
00:36:01,727 --> 00:36:03,527
   I WON'T JEOPARDIZE MY JOB.

757
00:36:03,529 --> 00:36:04,861
    LISTEN! IF WE DON'T GET
        RID OF THIS BODY

758
00:36:04,863 --> 00:36:06,463
     THAT WE'RE GOING TO GO
            TO JAIL

759
00:36:06,465 --> 00:36:07,831
    AND YOU WON'T EVEN HAVE
         A JOB, RIGHT?

760
00:36:07,833 --> 00:36:09,266
      YEAH, WELL, THANKS.
    THANKS TO YOUR SMOKING,

761
00:36:09,268 --> 00:36:10,834
   I FOR SURE LOST MY V.I.P.
         PARKING SPOT.

762
00:36:10,836 --> 00:36:12,802
             OKAY.

763
00:36:12,804 --> 00:36:15,839
   THIS IS GOOD. PEOPLE ONLY
   PAY IN CASH AT SEX SHOPS.

764
00:36:15,841 --> 00:36:17,941
         LET'S ROB IT.
            MM-HMM,
            MM-HMM.

765
00:36:17,943 --> 00:36:20,644
           IT'S GOOD.

766
00:36:23,415 --> 00:36:25,215
I CAN BARELY SEE.

767
00:36:25,217 --> 00:36:27,584
D.I.Y. TOILET PAPER,
          IT'S GENIUS.

768
00:36:27,586 --> 00:36:30,587
     I KNOW THIS PLACE AND
  THE WORKERS ARE ALWAYS HIGH.

769
00:36:30,589 --> 00:36:33,757
   IT'S EASY MONEY. COME ON.

770
00:36:33,759 --> 00:36:35,792
        THIS IS STUPID,
   SHAN, WE LOOK RIDICULOUS.

771
00:36:43,901 --> 00:36:45,602
DOES ANYBODY WORK
             HERE?

772
00:36:45,604 --> 00:36:47,537
     DOES ANYBODY WORK HERE?

773
00:36:47,539 --> 00:36:49,306
    YEAH, SORRY SMOKE BREAK.

774
00:36:51,275 --> 00:36:52,909
      OH, I LIKE THE T.P.
         ON YOUR HEAD.

775
00:36:52,911 --> 00:36:54,544
    IT'S ALL RAPEY AND SEXY.

776
00:36:54,546 --> 00:36:56,379
      I AM VERY INTO SCAT.

777
00:36:56,381 --> 00:36:58,348
    I NEED YOU TO COME OVER
         HERE RIGHT NOW

778
00:36:58,350 --> 00:37:00,750
  AND OPEN THIS CASH REGISTER
 AND I NEED ALL THE CASH, NOW.

779
00:37:00,752 --> 00:37:01,918
      YEAH, GET OVER HERE.

780
00:37:08,326 --> 00:37:10,927
    WHO KNEW SEX SHOPS WERE
   SUCH A CASH POOR BUSINESS.

781
00:37:10,929 --> 00:37:12,963
     THESE DILDOS HAVE GOT
     TO BE WORTH SOMETHING.

782
00:38:15,994 --> 00:38:17,894
       COME ON, LET'S GO.

783
00:38:21,666 --> 00:38:23,700
        I CAN'T BELIEVE
       WE ONLY MADE $400.

784
00:38:23,702 --> 00:38:26,436
        IT'S FAIR TO SAY
  WE OVERESTIMATED THE MARKET.

785
00:38:26,438 --> 00:38:27,871
        THAT'S A FUCKING
        UNDERSTATEMENT.

786
00:38:27,873 --> 00:38:29,506
       LESBIANS ARE POOR.

787
00:38:29,508 --> 00:38:31,474
        THEY ALWAYS ARE
    AND THEY ALWAYS WILL BE.

788
00:38:31,476 --> 00:38:33,576
   SHAN, DON'T BE HOMOPHOBIC
        RIGHT NOW, OKAY?

789
00:38:33,578 --> 00:38:34,911
     I ONLY TELL THE TRUTH.

790
00:38:34,913 --> 00:38:36,546
     WELL HERE'S THE TRUTH.

791
00:38:36,548 --> 00:38:39,349
        WHOSE GREAT IDEA
WAS IT TO ROB A SEX SHOP, OKAY?

792
00:38:39,351 --> 00:38:40,750
       IT'S WASN'T MINE.
        THAT WAS YOURS.

793
00:38:40,752 --> 00:38:42,519
       LET ME REMIND YOU.
    THAT WAS MY SECOND IDEA.

794
00:38:42,521 --> 00:38:43,953
MY FIRST WAS TO ROB HOTEL ROOMS,

795
00:38:43,955 --> 00:38:45,955
  BUT SOMEBODY WAS TOO SCARED
     OF GETTING IN TROUBLE.

796
00:38:45,957 --> 00:38:47,824
         YOU KNOW WHAT?

797
00:38:47,826 --> 00:38:49,592
WHY DON'T YOU TAKE THESE DILDOS
  AND SHOVE THEM UP YOUR ASS?

798
00:38:49,594 --> 00:38:50,794
      OH, THAT'S A REALLY
       NICE THING TO SAY

799
00:38:50,796 --> 00:38:53,530
  TO A RECOVERING SEX ADDICT.

800
00:38:53,532 --> 00:38:55,332
      COULD YOU NOT BE SO
      ANNOYING RIGHT NOW--

801
00:38:55,334 --> 00:38:56,800
  YOU STOP BEING SO ANNOYING!

802
00:38:56,802 --> 00:38:59,336
         STOP IT! STOP.

803
00:38:59,338 --> 00:39:00,370
 YOU WANT TO GET TITTY FUCKED?

804
00:39:00,372 --> 00:39:01,838
      I'LL TITTY FUCK YOU!

805
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:03,606
       - TITTY FUCK THIS!
 - NO! OKAY! YOU'RE GOING DOWN.

806
00:39:03,608 --> 00:39:06,042
       - OH, MY GOD. OW!
            - YEAH.

807
00:39:06,044 --> 00:39:07,877
      WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
          GET OFF ME!

808
00:39:07,879 --> 00:39:10,013
- NO, IT'S MY TURN TO HURT YOU.
  - WHAT DID I EVER DO TO YOU?

809
00:39:10,015 --> 00:39:11,981
      WE WOULDN'T BE HERE
     IF IT WASN'T FOR YOU.

810
00:39:11,983 --> 00:39:13,850
       OH, SURE. BLAME ME
         FOR EVERYTHING
      WHILE YOU'RE AT IT.

811
00:39:13,852 --> 00:39:15,919
     BLAME ME FOR MOM DYING
       OF CANCER AND DAD

812
00:39:15,921 --> 00:39:18,088
        DRINKING HIMSELF
         TO DEATH. OW!

813
00:39:18,090 --> 00:39:19,989
         I ALREADY DO!

814
00:39:26,497 --> 00:39:28,131
      WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

815
00:39:28,133 --> 00:39:30,834
      WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

816
00:39:30,836 --> 00:39:32,869
 WE STILL HAVE A ROTTING CORPSE
         TO DEAL WITH.

817
00:39:32,871 --> 00:39:34,704
         YOU KNOW WHAT?

818
00:39:34,706 --> 00:39:37,374
        JUST TURN ME IN
      BECAUSE I DON'T GIVE
        A SHIT ANYMORE.

819
00:39:37,376 --> 00:39:39,409
             FUCK!

820
00:40:13,110 --> 00:40:14,744
     GIVE ME ONE OF THOSE.

821
00:40:16,714 --> 00:40:17,914
        YOU'RE WELCOME.

822
00:40:17,916 --> 00:40:19,949
      AM I SUPPOSED TO SAY
           THANK YOU?

823
00:40:19,951 --> 00:40:21,785
       MOST PEOPLE WOULD.

824
00:40:21,787 --> 00:40:25,922
  FROM WHAT YOUR SISTER SAYS,
    YOU'RE NOT MOST PEOPLE.

825
00:40:25,924 --> 00:40:28,124
       WELL, MARTHA NEEDS
         TO LEARN HER
      FUCKING MOUTH SHUT.

826
00:40:28,126 --> 00:40:29,826
          WHOA! WHOA!

827
00:40:29,828 --> 00:40:31,161
           LANGUAGE.

828
00:40:32,463 --> 00:40:35,532
             LOOK,
  I KNOW IT CAN BE DIFFICULT,

829
00:40:35,534 --> 00:40:39,569
         BUT, YOU KNOW,
 YOUR SISTER'S PULLING FOR YOU.

830
00:40:39,571 --> 00:40:40,770
      SHE'S A GOOD PERSON.

831
00:40:40,772 --> 00:40:41,938
        HOW DO YOU KNOW?

832
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:43,540
       SHE HELPED ME QUIT
         SMOKING WEED.

833
00:40:43,542 --> 00:40:45,608
        IT DOESN'T LOOK
   LIKE SHE WAS VERY HELPFUL.

834
00:40:48,446 --> 00:40:50,013
      I USED TO SMOKE WEED
       LIKE ALL THE TIME.

835
00:40:50,015 --> 00:40:51,181
 I NEVER GET ANY WRITING DONE.

836
00:40:51,183 --> 00:40:54,083
        NOW I JUST SMOKE
     BEFORE AND AFTER WORK,

837
00:40:54,085 --> 00:40:56,085
     AND I GET STUFF DONE.

838
00:40:56,087 --> 00:41:00,023
      IN REHAB WE HAD MORE
 OF AN ALL-OR-NOTHING APPROACH

839
00:41:00,025 --> 00:41:03,226
       WITH A LITTLE BIT
        OF HIGHER POWERS

840
00:41:03,228 --> 00:41:06,162
       SURRENDER YOURSELF
     BULLSHIT PEPPERED IN.

841
00:41:06,164 --> 00:41:07,764
         DOES IT WORK?

842
00:41:07,766 --> 00:41:09,799
   IT SEEMS TO IF YOU BELIEVE
      YOU HAVE A PROBLEM.

843
00:41:12,570 --> 00:41:14,604
     SO WHAT DO YOU WRITE?

844
00:41:15,773 --> 00:41:19,108
      UH...I WRITE POETRY.

845
00:41:19,110 --> 00:41:21,044
            REALLY?

846
00:41:21,046 --> 00:41:23,513
  SO YOU'RE ALL DEEP AND SHIT?

847
00:41:23,515 --> 00:41:25,782
      I DON'T KNOW, MAYBE.

848
00:41:25,784 --> 00:41:28,785
     WELL, LET'S HEAR ONE.

849
00:41:28,787 --> 00:41:30,053
            FRESNO.

850
00:41:30,055 --> 00:41:31,688
    I DON'T LIKE IT ALREADY.

851
00:41:35,159 --> 00:41:36,893
            FRESNO.

852
00:41:36,895 --> 00:41:40,163
    LORD, WHY IS IT SO HOT?

853
00:41:40,165 --> 00:41:42,131
      DID YOU MEAN FOR IT
        TO BE THIS HOT?

854
00:41:42,133 --> 00:41:44,834
   OR DID YOU LEAVE THE HOUSE
     IN A HURRY AND FRESNO

855
00:41:44,836 --> 00:41:47,036
    WAS THE OVEN YOU FORGET
          TO TURN OFF?

856
00:41:47,038 --> 00:41:48,538
            FRESNO.

857
00:41:48,540 --> 00:41:51,140
YES, THAT SMELL IS DEAD ANIMAL.

858
00:41:51,142 --> 00:41:53,276
        DO YOU LIKE IT?

859
00:41:53,278 --> 00:41:54,944
            FRESNO.

860
00:41:54,946 --> 00:41:59,082
        WHERE IS STUFF,
        LIKE, ANYTHING?

861
00:41:59,084 --> 00:42:03,520
   FRESNO, WHERE THE BEST JOB
  I COULD GET IS THE WORSE JOB

862
00:42:03,522 --> 00:42:05,121
         I'VE EVER HAD.

863
00:42:05,123 --> 00:42:08,057
   NO, HOTEL GUEST, I CANNOT
  TELL YOU WHERE ANYTHING IS.

864
00:42:08,059 --> 00:42:13,229
IF KNEW WHERE ANYTHING ELSE WAS,
         I'D BE THERE.

865
00:42:13,231 --> 00:42:15,131
            FRESNO.

866
00:42:22,239 --> 00:42:25,909
            COME ON!

867
00:42:25,911 --> 00:42:28,578
        COME ON, MARTHA.
     MY DEAD GRANDMA COULD
     KICK HARDER THAN YOU.

868
00:42:36,854 --> 00:42:37,887
          THERE WE GO!

869
00:42:37,889 --> 00:42:39,789
            COME ON!

870
00:42:42,593 --> 00:42:47,130
         SO, LIKE SANDS
     THROUGH THE HOURGLASS,

871
00:42:47,132 --> 00:42:50,567
 SO ARE THE DAYS OF OUR LIVES.

872
00:42:50,569 --> 00:42:52,302
       THAT'S PLAGIARISM.

873
00:42:52,304 --> 00:42:53,636
    I LITERALLY WROTE THAT.

874
00:42:53,638 --> 00:42:54,971
          WHETHER YOU
       BELIEVE IT OR NOT.

875
00:42:54,973 --> 00:42:56,873
         - I THINK SO.
       - THAT'S SO LAME.

876
00:42:56,875 --> 00:42:58,141
       THAT'S PARTIALLY.

877
00:42:58,143 --> 00:43:00,043
     I THINK YOU DON'T KNOW
       ENOUGH ABOUT PROSE

878
00:43:00,045 --> 00:43:01,811
       TO REALLY GIVE ME
     AN ACCURATE CRITIQUE.

879
00:43:01,813 --> 00:43:03,313
   I KNOW ABOUT PROS. I KNOW
  ABOUT PRO BASEBALL PLAYERS.

880
00:43:03,315 --> 00:43:05,949
  I KNOW ABOUT PRO BASKETBALL
    PLAYERS. I KNOW ABOUT--

881
00:43:05,951 --> 00:43:08,651

00:43:08,653 --> 00:43:11,287
          DO YOU WANT
      TO GO DO SOMETHING?

883
00:43:11,289 --> 00:43:12,755
             I DO.

884
00:43:12,757 --> 00:43:14,157
OKAY, EVERYONE
          IN A CIRCLE.

885
00:43:14,159 --> 00:43:16,693
      YES. FASTER, FASTER,
        FASTER, FASTER!

886
00:43:22,266 --> 00:43:24,968
  KRAV MAGA. WE HAVE ONE RULE,
         ONE RULE ONLY.

887
00:43:24,970 --> 00:43:26,803
      NEVER STOP FIGHTING!

888
00:43:33,277 --> 00:43:35,011
- HIYAH.

00:48:56,166 --> 00:48:58,034
OW!
   - IT'S GOING TO LOOK GOOD.

1014
00:48:58,036 --> 00:48:59,936
      I'M GOING TO GET IT
       NICE AND STRAIGHT.

1015
00:48:59,938 --> 00:49:01,137
              OW!

1016
00:49:01,139 --> 00:49:02,138
         STOP YELLING.

1017
00:49:02,140 --> 00:49:03,539
        IT DOESN'T HURT.

1018
00:49:03,541 --> 00:49:05,508
        SORRY, I GUESS
       I'M JUST NERVOUS.

1019
00:49:05,510 --> 00:49:07,076
     ABOUT THE BAR MITZVAH?

1020
00:49:07,078 --> 00:49:08,477
    ERIC'S GOING TO HELP US.

1021
00:49:13,016 --> 00:49:14,150
       THINK YOU'VE EVER
         BEEN IN LOVE?

1022
00:49:14,152 --> 00:49:16,585
  I'M NOT GOOD WITH EMOTIONS.

1023
00:49:16,587 --> 00:49:18,654
       AS SOON AS I START
    TO GET CLOSE TO SOMEONE,

1024
00:49:18,656 --> 00:49:20,489
    I JUST-- I FEEL CROWDED

1025
00:49:20,491 --> 00:49:22,258
     AND I'M NOT ATTRACTED
        TO THEM ANYMORE.

1026
00:49:22,260 --> 00:49:23,993
    HOW MANY GUYS YOU THINK
       YOU'VE BEEN WITH?

1027
00:49:26,496 --> 00:49:29,165
        - I DON'T KNOW.
      - LIKE A BALL PARK.

1028
00:49:29,167 --> 00:49:30,533
        LIKE A HUNDRED?

1029
00:49:30,535 --> 00:49:32,501
           100 DICKS?

1030
00:49:32,503 --> 00:49:36,005
      STUPID THING IS MOST
      OF THE TIME I DON'T
       EVEN LIKE THE SEX.

1031
00:49:36,007 --> 00:49:37,406
     THEN WHY DO YOU DO IT?

1032
00:49:37,408 --> 00:49:39,241
         I DON'T KNOW.
   LIKE THE PAIN OF DOING IT

1033
00:49:39,243 --> 00:49:43,679
        IS NOT AS BAD AS
         THE EMPTINESS
        OF NOT DOING IT.

1034
00:49:43,681 --> 00:49:45,047
     DOES THAT MAKE SENSE?

1035
00:49:48,151 --> 00:49:49,251
            MARTHA.

1036
00:49:49,253 --> 00:49:52,021
             YEAH.

1037
00:49:52,023 --> 00:49:54,690
       I WAS A 100% WRONG
        ABOUT YOUR HAIR.

1038
00:49:54,692 --> 00:49:57,193
     - WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?
        - IT'S NOT GOOD.

1039
00:49:59,529 --> 00:50:00,696
         DO COUSIN IT.

1040
00:50:00,698 --> 00:50:02,398
           NO, SHAN,
    I'M NOT GOING TO DO IT.

1041
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:04,600
        - YES, YOU ARE.
  - SHANNON, I'M NOT DOING IT.

1042
00:50:04,602 --> 00:50:10,072
      DO I LOOK PRETTY FOR
     THE BAR MITZVAH PARTY?

1043
00:50:22,652 --> 00:50:26,322
    HEY, IF TONIGHT DOESN'T
  GO TOO LATE MAYBE YOU COULD

1044
00:50:26,324 --> 00:50:28,124
  COME OVER AND, I DON'T KNOW,

1045
00:50:28,126 --> 00:50:30,126
    WATCH "NAKED AND AFRAID"
          WITH ME OR--

1046
00:50:30,128 --> 00:50:31,527
          YEAH, MAYBE.
     WE'LL SEE HOW IT GOES.

00:50:31,529 --> 00:50:34,330
         HEY, LADIES,

00:50:38,302 --> 00:50:40,102
   OH, THANKS. THAT'S SWEET.

1051
00:50:40,104 --> 00:50:42,104
  I'LL PUT IT IN MY MONEY BOX
          OVER THERE.

1052
00:50:42,106 --> 00:50:43,272
        IT'S CASH ONLY.

1053
00:50:43,274 --> 00:50:45,141
        YEAH, WE HEARD.

1054
00:50:45,143 --> 00:50:47,743
             YEAH.
     IT'S ACTUALLY COUPONS
       FOR FREE PRIVATES.

1055
00:50:47,745 --> 00:50:49,745
     PRIVATES? YOU HITTING
           ON ME BOO?

1056
00:50:49,747 --> 00:50:51,080
         I'M A MAN NOW,
       SO IT'S COPASETIC.

1057
00:50:51,082 --> 00:50:53,082
     DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

1058
00:50:53,084 --> 00:50:54,316
     ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.
      TAKE IT EASY, NOT IN
       FRONT OF MY DATE.

1059
00:50:54,318 --> 00:50:55,384
      DON'T TALK TO KELLY
           LIKE THAT.

1060
00:50:55,386 --> 00:50:57,086
    IT'S REALLY RUDE, NOAH.

1061
00:50:57,088 --> 00:50:59,288
 DO YOU THINK YOU GUYS CAN MAKE
  OUT ON MY NEXT MUSIC VIDEO?

1062
00:50:59,290 --> 00:51:02,458
     GOOGLE GLORIA STEINEM
        AND THEN ASK US.

1063
00:51:02,460 --> 00:51:04,326
        SO HOW LONG WILL
       THESE THINGS LAST?

1064
00:51:04,328 --> 00:51:06,796
        ABOUT AS LONG AS
 A WEDDING RECEPTION, YOU KNOW.

1065
00:51:06,798 --> 00:51:08,697
           - REALLY?
            - YEAH.

1066
00:51:08,699 --> 00:51:10,232
      I DON'T REALLY KNOW
        HOW LONG THAT IS

1067
00:51:10,234 --> 00:51:11,634
    BECAUSE I'VE NEVER BEEN
         TO A WEDDING.

1068
00:51:11,636 --> 00:51:13,836
            REALLY?

1069
00:51:13,838 --> 00:51:16,772
         I WENT TO ONE,
     BUT IT DOESN'T REALLY
    COUNT BECAUSE WE ELOPED.

1070
00:51:16,774 --> 00:51:18,240
        YOU'RE MARRIED?

1071
00:51:18,242 --> 00:51:21,077
          YEAH. WHAT?

1072
00:51:21,079 --> 00:51:22,244
       I CAN BE MARRIED.

1073
00:51:22,246 --> 00:51:24,080
     I TOTALLY GOT MARRIED.

1074
00:51:24,082 --> 00:51:27,083
 AND NINE DAYS LATER I CHEATED
  ON HIM AND WE GOT DIVORCED.

1075
00:51:27,085 --> 00:51:31,520
  SUPER ROMANTIC LIKE I SAID,
   LIKE A FAIRYTALE ACTUALLY.

1076
00:51:31,522 --> 00:51:33,589
          I'D READ IT
        COVER TO COVER.

1077
00:51:33,591 --> 00:51:35,825
  I'M THINKING OF PITCHING IT
     AS A CHILDREN'S BOOK.

1078
00:51:35,827 --> 00:51:37,560
       - OH, YOU SHOULD.
           - OR Y.A.

1079
00:51:37,562 --> 00:51:38,561
        THAT'S PROBABLY
       THE BETTER CHOICE.

1080
00:51:38,563 --> 00:51:40,596
             YEAH.

1081
00:51:48,338 --> 00:51:50,706
     Y'ALL READY FOR THIS?

         DINNER WILL BE
     IN ABOUT FIVE MINUTES

1121
00:54:39,977 --> 00:54:43,545
 IF OUR VERY EXPENSIVE CATERING
COMPANY WOULD JUST DO THEIR JOB.

1128
00:55:01,932 --> 00:55:03,032
        AND NOW YOU WANT
       US TO GET MARRIED.

1129
00:55:03,034 --> 00:55:04,366
           NO, SHAN,

00:56:15,439 --> 00:56:17,072
             - GO.
    - ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.

1156
00:56:17,074 --> 00:56:19,575
    I THINK IT'S A SEIZURE.

1157
00:56:19,577 --> 00:56:20,809
    I THINK IT'S A SEIZURE.

1158
00:56:20,811 --> 00:56:22,511
       EVERYONE GET BACK,
           GET BACK.

1159
00:56:22,513 --> 00:56:23,979
  NOBODY PANIC, NOBODY PANIC.

00:56:23,981 --> 00:56:25,147
    SHE'S GOING TO BE FINE.
        WATCH HER ARMS.

1161
00:56:25,149 --> 00:56:26,715
        SHE'S SLAPPING--

1162
00:56:26,717 --> 00:56:27,716
GIVE HER SOME AIR!
        JUST STEP BACK!

1163
00:56:27,718 --> 00:56:30,052

00:56:33,624 --> 00:56:34,823
CALM DOWN.

1167
00:56:34,825 --> 00:56:37,559
         IT WILL STOP.
     JUST LET HER BE CALM.

          OH, PEANUT.

00:56:52,410 --> 00:56:53,976
THAT IS REALLY
    A BAD THING THESE DAYS.

1175
00:56:53,978 --> 00:56:55,010
        THERE'S PEANUTS
         IN EVERYTHING.

1176
00:56:55,012 --> 00:56:56,612
           ALL RIGHT.

1177
00:56:56,614 --> 00:56:58,480
    GIVE IT UP FOR THIS GUY.
      THIS GUY IS A HERO.

1178
00:56:58,482 --> 00:57:00,015
          HERO! HERO!

1179
00:57:06,022 --> 00:57:08,857
          - THANK YOU.

00:57:12,029 --> 00:57:14,663
      YEAH, I THINK I AM.
         IT WAS JUST A
       SEIZURE, I GUESS.

1183
00:57:14,665 --> 00:57:18,534
    OKAY. I THINK WE SHOULD
    JUST GO BACK TO MY PLACE

1184
00:57:18,536 --> 00:57:19,768
  SO I CAN KEEP AN EYE ON YOU.

1185
00:57:19,770 --> 00:57:20,869
        HOW ABOUT THAT?

1186
00:57:20,871 --> 00:57:22,638
 OH GOSH. I DON'T KNOW, KELLY.

1187
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:25,140
   I THINK I SHOULD PROBABLY
       JUST GO HOME ALONE

1188
00:57:25,142 --> 00:57:27,976
       'CAUSE, YOU KNOW,
       I NEARLY JUST DIED
          KIND OF SO.

1189
00:57:27,978 --> 00:57:29,745
       OKAY. WHAT IS IT?

1190
00:57:29,747 --> 00:57:33,482
    DO YOU NOT LIKE HANGING
   OUT WITH ME OR SOMETHING?

00:57:33,484 --> 00:57:37,619
       NO, IT'S NOT THAT.
     IT'S, LIKE, SHANNON--

1192
00:57:37,621 --> 00:57:40,589
   MY SISTER IS-- AT MY HOUSE
     SO I HAVE TO BE THERE.

1193
00:57:40,591 --> 00:57:42,724
         OKAY. YOU HAVE
         TO STOP USING
       YOUR ADULT SISTER

1194
00:57:42,726 --> 00:57:44,059
          AS AN EXCUSE
      FOR BLOWING ME OFF.

1195
00:57:44,061 --> 00:57:45,794
    I'M NOT BLOWING YOU OFF.

1196
00:57:45,796 --> 00:57:46,929
     I DON'T WANT YOU THINK
      I'M BLOWING YOU OFF.

      IF YOU NOTICED THAT.

  AM I SUPPOSED TO PLAY GAMES
          AND PRETEND

1205
00:58:06,250 --> 00:58:07,950
     LIKE I DON'T LIKE YOU
      AND BE MEAN TO YOU?

1206
00:58:07,952 --> 00:58:09,852
   IS THAT WHAT ALICIA DOES?

1207
00:58:09,854 --> 00:58:12,788
    SHOULD I BE LIKE ALICIA
   AND FLIRT WITH OTHER GUYS
           IN THE GYM

      I DON'T KNOW, KELLY.

1215
00:58:24,268 --> 00:58:26,134
         I DON'T THINK
       IT'S A GOOD IDEA.

1216
00:58:26,136 --> 00:58:28,203
       WAIT, WAIT, KELLY!

1217
00:58:28,205 --> 00:58:29,771
    HEY, AND YOU KNOW WHAT,

  I DON'T KNOW ANYONE WAS HERE
    SO I'M JUST GOING TO GO

1223
00:58:54,899 --> 00:58:56,698
      AND YOU CAN CONTINUE
       YOU'RE BLUBBERING.

1224
00:58:56,700 --> 00:58:58,834

    - YOU'RE SO INSENSITIVE.

1225
00:58:58,836 --> 00:59:00,202
     ARE YOU EVEN A WOMAN?

1226
00:59:00,204 --> 00:59:03,906
     HEY, I'M SORRY, OKAY?

1227
00:59:03,908 --> 00:59:05,207

00:59:05,209 --> 00:59:07,109
      OKAY FINE. I'M NOT!

1229
00:59:07,111 --> 00:59:10,045
   I SAW AN "OPRAH" ON THIS.

00:59:10,047 --> 00:59:12,581
   HEY WAIT-- NOW LISTEN I AM
      NOT SOCIOPATH, OKAY?

1231

         I FEEL STUFF.

1232
00:59:13,984 --> 00:59:15,851
          I EMPATHIZE
  AND I SYMPATHIZE WHICH MEANS

1233
00:59:15,853 --> 00:59:17,553
   THAT I'M NOT A SOCIOPATH!

1234
00:59:17,555 --> 00:59:19,021
   OKAY, WELL, IF THAT'S TRUE

1235
00:59:19,023 --> 00:59:20,656
         THEN WHY DON'T
   YOU ASK ME WHY I'M CRYING?

1236
00:59:26,162 --> 00:59:28,330
    ALL RIGHT, I CAN DO IT.

1237
00:59:28,332 --> 00:59:30,232
         WHAT'S WRONG?

1238
00:59:30,234 --> 00:59:32,968
  OKAY, WELL WHEN I CONFRONTED
       SCOTT ABOUT YOU--

1239
00:59:32,970 --> 00:59:34,102
          WHO'S SCOTT?

1240
00:59:34,104 --> 00:59:35,804
          MY HUSBAND,
     THE ONE THAT YOU BLEW.

1241
00:59:35,806 --> 00:59:38,273
    OH, YES, OKAY. AND SCOTT
   YOU TALKED TO HIM ABOUT...

1242
00:59:38,275 --> 00:59:39,808
    YEAH, HE DIDN'T DENY IT.

1243
00:59:39,810 --> 00:59:41,176
    HE ADMITTED IT WAS TRUE.

1244
00:59:41,178 --> 00:59:42,311
             OKAY.

1245
00:59:42,313 --> 00:59:44,046
      AND THEN I ASKED HIM
        IF IT WAS GOOD.

1246
00:59:44,048 --> 00:59:46,782
        AND I COULD TELL
      THAT HE DIDN'T WANT
        TO SAY ANYTHING

1247
00:59:46,784 --> 00:59:48,884
   BUT I FORCED IT OUT OF HIM

1248
00:59:48,886 --> 00:59:54,256
      AND HE SAID THAT IT
      WAS THE BEST BLOWJOB
          OF HIS LIFE.

1249
00:59:54,258 --> 00:59:56,091
        AND NOW WE JUST
      CAN'T STOP FIGHTING

1250
00:59:56,093 --> 00:59:57,693
      AND I CAN'T HAVE SEX
            WITH HIM

1251
00:59:57,695 --> 00:59:59,194
     AND I JUST DON'T KNOW
      WHAT I'M GOING TO DO

1252
00:59:59,196 --> 01:00:03,966
       BECAUSE I JUST--
         I CAN NEVER--
      I CAN NEVER DO THAT!

1253
01:00:03,968 --> 01:00:05,934
          YEAH, OKAY,
         YOU CAN DO IT,
         YOU CAN DO IT.

1254
01:00:05,936 --> 01:00:07,736
         YOU KNOW WHAT,
    I KNOW HOW TO FIX THIS.

1255
01:00:10,039 --> 01:00:12,140
        WE'LL USE THIS.

1256
01:00:12,142 --> 01:00:13,942
       I'M GOING TO TEACH
      HOW TO GIVE THE BEST
     BLOWJOB OF YOUR LIFE.

1257
01:00:13,944 --> 01:00:16,678
       OKAY, BUT HOLD ON,
        CAN WE USE THIS?

1258
01:00:20,116 --> 01:00:22,084
      DOESN'T SURPRISE ME
      PHIL TOOK THE CASH.

1259
01:00:22,086 --> 01:00:24,019
     HE WAS IN BUCHENWALD.

1260
01:00:24,021 --> 01:00:25,687
  BECAUSE YOU CAN'T GET FREAKY
   WHEN THERE'S A HOLOCAUST.

1261
01:00:25,689 --> 01:00:26,955
       IT WAS A GOOD RUN!

1262
01:00:26,957 --> 01:00:29,057
         "SUCKY, SUCKY
       MY BIG FAT COCK!"

1263
01:00:29,059 --> 01:00:30,292

  SO, WHAT DO YOU NORMALLY DO?

1265
01:00:32,863 --> 01:00:37,332
      I JUST CLOSE MY EYES
           AND THEN--

1266
01:00:37,334 --> 01:00:39,001
    LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE EATING
          A CORN COB.

1267
01:00:39,003 --> 01:00:40,268
        THAT'S NOT GOING
    TO FEEL GOOD TO ANYONE.

1268
01:00:40,270 --> 01:00:42,204
            - OKAY.
            - OKAY.

       WATCH A PORN ONCE
     IN A WHILE BY YOURSELF

1272
01:00:47,978 --> 01:00:49,745

      OH, I THOUGHT I SAW
       A "DATELINE" ABOUT
     THAT THEY WERE SLAVES.

1276
01:00:55,653 --> 01:00:56,952
              NO.

1277
01:00:56,954 --> 01:00:59,287
   NO, THEY PUT THEM IN A BOX
      AND SHIP THEM OVER--

            - OKAY?

1293
01:01:27,151 --> 01:01:28,784
     SO NOW IN ORDER TO GET
    OUT THE YOGURT YOU HAVE
         TO SQUEEZE IT.

1294
01:01:28,786 --> 01:01:30,118
             OKAY.

1295
01:01:30,120 --> 01:01:31,420
      AND YOU WANT TO PUT
     YOUR MOUTH ON THE TIP.

1296
01:01:31,422 --> 01:01:33,422
             OKAY.

1297
01:01:33,424 --> 01:01:34,923
   NOW YOU'RE GOING TO BRING
     YOUR HANDS UP TO MEET
          YOUR MOUTH.

1298
01:01:34,925 --> 01:01:36,191
  - AS YOUR MOUTH GOES DOWN--
            - OKAY.

1299
01:01:36,193 --> 01:01:38,260
       YOUR HAND GOES UP.

1300
01:01:38,262 --> 01:01:39,394
       AND IT'S LIKE THAT
     AND IT'S-- SO THEY'RE

             - YES!

1302
01:01:40,764 --> 01:01:41,763
   - MOUTH BENEATH THE HAND.
             - YES!

1303
01:01:41,765 --> 01:01:43,165
    MOUTH BENEATH THE HAND.

01:01:43,167 --> 01:01:45,100
 - YEAH! YOU'RE GOING TO GET--
           - MOUTH--

      YOU'RE GOING TO GET
    YOUR HAND UP TO THE TOP,

1306
01:01:46,837 --> 01:01:48,103
     HOLD IT REALLY TIGHT,
       SPIT IN YOUR PALM,

1307
01:01:48,105 --> 01:01:50,706
     RUB IT AROUND THE TOP,
         POINT IT AWAY,

1308
01:01:50,708 --> 01:01:51,907
        SHOOTS OUT INTO
        THE STARS, OKAY?

1309
01:01:51,909 --> 01:01:53,141
            - OKAY.
          - ALL RIGHT.

1310
01:01:53,143 --> 01:01:54,342
         YOU GOT THIS.
      NOW GO, GO, GO, GO!

1311
01:01:54,344 --> 01:01:55,811

1312
01:01:55,813 --> 01:01:56,978
       - YEAH, THAT'S IT.
          - THANK YOU!

1313
01:01:56,980 --> 01:01:58,480
             OKAY.

1314
01:02:05,788 --> 01:02:08,223
        WHAT DO YOU MEAN
       IT'S ONLY 12,000?

1315
01:02:08,225 --> 01:02:10,225
       COME ON, COME ON.
      IT'S A LOT OF MONEY,

1316
01:02:10,227 --> 01:02:11,993
          IT'S LIKE--
    THAT'S LIKE SIX DIGITS.

1317
01:02:11,995 --> 01:02:14,262
    I SAID I WANTED 25,000.

1318
01:02:14,264 --> 01:02:17,399
        WELL YOU CAN GET
       A HOUSE IN DETROIT
        FOR, LIKE, $800.

1319
01:02:17,401 --> 01:02:19,134
     I DIDN'T WANT A HOUSE!

1320
01:02:19,136 --> 01:02:20,368
      I WANTED A BUILDING.

1321
01:02:20,370 --> 01:02:22,304
     COME ON, RUBY, PLEASE?

1322
01:02:22,306 --> 01:02:23,472
         BUT IT'S CASH.

1323
01:02:23,474 --> 01:02:25,407
            I MEAN
      IT'S ALL RIGHT HERE.

1324
01:02:25,409 --> 01:02:28,009
       IT'S A GOOD START,
    GET EVERYTHING ROLLING,
           YOU KNOW?

1325
01:02:28,011 --> 01:02:30,746
IT'S A GREAT START.

1326
01:02:30,748 --> 01:02:32,447
   I'LL SELL THE THUNDERBIRD.

1327
01:02:32,449 --> 01:02:35,217
 - YOU'LL SELL THE THUNDERBIRD?
 - I PROMISE! I DON'T NEED IT.

1328
01:02:35,219 --> 01:02:37,052
          SUPER COOL.

1329
01:02:37,054 --> 01:02:39,287
             OKAY.

1330
01:02:39,289 --> 01:02:41,189
    WE'LL TURN THE OVEN ON.

1331
01:02:47,430 --> 01:02:49,197
      IT WAS REALLY SWEET
        OF YOU TO COME.

1332
01:02:49,199 --> 01:02:50,866
           OF COURSE!

1333
01:02:50,868 --> 01:02:52,501
   YOU COULD'VE JUST TOLD ME

1334
01:02:52,503 --> 01:02:55,771
    YOU'RE BEING BLACKMAILED
  FOR KILLING SOME GUY'S DOG.

1335
01:02:55,773 --> 01:02:59,941
      I FEEL BAD ABOUT IT.
          I STILL DO.

1336
01:02:59,943 --> 01:03:02,110
      THIS IS MY LAST DOG!

1337
01:03:02,112 --> 01:03:05,480
     SUCK MY DICK, FRESNO!

1338
01:03:05,482 --> 01:03:07,849
   WHAT'S UP WITH THAT CHICK?

1339
01:03:07,851 --> 01:03:11,286
  OH, SHE'S MOVING TO DETROIT.

1340
01:03:11,288 --> 01:03:14,356
          OKAY. UM...

1341
01:03:14,358 --> 01:03:20,529
         LET'S ALL BOW
       OUR HEADS AND HAVE
      A MOMENT OF SILENCE.

1342
01:03:22,498 --> 01:03:27,035
   BORIS, OH PRECIOUS BORIS.

1343
01:03:29,005 --> 01:03:34,009
       HE WAS A CHAMPION
  BUT HE WAS ALSO A DIRTY DOG.

1344
01:03:36,546 --> 01:03:42,350
 OH, GOD, PLEASE WATCH OVER HIM
AND TAKE HIM TO A BETTER PLACE.

1345
01:03:42,352 --> 01:03:45,020
EVERYONE DESERVES THEIR DIGNITY.

1346
01:03:45,022 --> 01:03:48,957
     WE'VE ALL DONE THINGS
      WE'RE NOT PROUD OF.

1347
01:03:48,959 --> 01:03:50,826
         THE LAST TIME
      I WAS AT A CEMETERY

1348
01:03:50,828 --> 01:03:53,295
  WAS FOR MY FATHER'S FUNERAL.

1349
01:03:53,297 --> 01:03:55,297
    IT WAS NOT AN EASY TIME
         FOR ANY OF US

1350
01:03:55,299 --> 01:03:58,400
BUT ESPECIALLY NOT FOR MY SISTER
SHANNON BECAUSE SHE DIDN'T SHOW.

1351
01:03:58,402 --> 01:04:00,135
 I KNOW SHE WANTED TO BE THERE

1352
01:04:00,137 --> 01:04:03,505
    BUT SHE COULDN'T BECAUSE
     SHE DIDN'T FEEL GOOD.

1353
01:04:03,507 --> 01:04:05,574
       I DON'T BLAME HER.

1354
01:04:05,576 --> 01:04:08,310
          IT'S JUST--
   SOMETIMES IT'S HARD FOR ME

1355
01:04:08,312 --> 01:04:10,145
  TO DO EVERYTHING ON MY OWN,

1356
01:04:10,147 --> 01:04:12,414
           SO I GUESS
    I'M JUST REALLY GRATEFUL

1357
01:04:12,416 --> 01:04:14,316
        THAT WE MADE IT
  THROUGH THIS TIME TOGETHER.

1358
01:04:16,085 --> 01:04:18,019
             YEAH.

1359
01:04:42,044 --> 01:04:43,211
          HI, MARTHA.

1360
01:04:56,459 --> 01:05:00,061
        MARTHA! MARTHA!

1361
01:05:03,232 --> 01:05:04,966
    WE SLEPT TOGETHER BEFORE

1362
01:05:04,968 --> 01:05:06,968
        SO THERE'S LIKE
A GRANDFATHER CLAUSE SITUATION,

1363
01:05:09,672 --> 01:05:11,506
    THEY STILL BUILD THESE.
       ISN'T THAT CRAZY?

1364
01:05:11,508 --> 01:05:14,042
         LITTLE SHEDS?

1365
01:05:14,044 --> 01:05:17,412
 MARTHA! MARTHA, STOP RUNNING!

1366
01:05:17,414 --> 01:05:19,180
        MARTHA, COME ON!

1367
01:05:19,182 --> 01:05:20,348
        WAIT, I'M SORRY!

1368
01:05:20,350 --> 01:05:22,150
 SORRY, YOU'RE NOT SORRY, SHAN!

1369
01:05:22,152 --> 01:05:23,585
       IT'S NOT MY FAULT!

1370
01:05:23,587 --> 01:05:25,420
        IT'S MY DISEASE!
        I CAN'T HELP IT!

1371
01:05:25,422 --> 01:05:27,923
       OF COURSE, RIGHT.
         YOU NEVER MEAN
        TO DO ANYTHING.

1372
01:05:27,925 --> 01:05:30,225
 YOU KNOW YOU'RE JUST LIKE DAD.

1373
01:05:30,227 --> 01:05:32,360
   JUST BLAME EVERYONE ELSE.

1374
01:05:32,362 --> 01:05:35,563
     IT'S NEVER YOU, RIGHT?

1375
01:05:35,565 --> 01:05:39,367
 WELL, I AM SO TIRED OF TRYING
          TO HELP YOU.

1376
01:05:43,039 --> 01:05:44,306
            MARTHA!

1377
01:05:44,308 --> 01:05:46,641
    YOU CAN'T LEAVE ME HERE!

1378
01:05:46,643 --> 01:05:48,176
  DON'T COME BACK TO MY PLACE!

1379
01:05:48,178 --> 01:05:50,078
           I'M DONE!

1380
01:05:56,185 --> 01:05:58,620
     IT'S HARD LETTING GO,
           ISN'T IT?

1381
01:06:01,257 --> 01:06:03,224
        IF ONLY POP TART
       COULD'VE SPOKEN UP

1382
01:06:03,226 --> 01:06:06,261
          AND TOLD ME
    WHAT WAS BOTHERING HER.

1383
01:06:06,263 --> 01:06:10,732
     BUT TURTLES CAN'T LET
YOU KNOW WHAT'S GOING, CAN THEY?

1384
01:06:10,734 --> 01:06:12,634
      ROBOTS CAN'T EITHER.

1385
01:06:39,362 --> 01:06:41,463
         BACK SO SOON?

1386
01:06:41,465 --> 01:06:44,265
 STAYING FOR A WHILE THIS TIME.

1387
01:06:44,267 --> 01:06:46,001
       YOU HIT THE LOTTO?

1388
01:06:46,003 --> 01:06:48,737
     THIS IS LEFT OVER FROM
       BAR MITZVAH MONEY.

1389
01:06:48,739 --> 01:06:50,672
           GOOD LUCK.

1390
01:06:50,674 --> 01:06:53,775
MY MOM DIED OF CANCER
  THEN MY DAD DIED OF ALCOHOL,

1391
01:06:53,777 --> 01:06:55,677
    AND MY LITTLE SISTER HAD
      NO ONE TO HELP HER.

1392
01:06:55,679 --> 01:06:59,748
  AND INSTEAD OF HELPING HER I
JUST BLEW OFF MY DAD'S FUNERAL.

1393
01:07:02,385 --> 01:07:06,521
   AND A FEW MONTHS AGO I DID
   SOME REALLY HORRIBLE SHIT

1394
01:07:06,523 --> 01:07:12,093
   WHICH IS WHY I'M HERE, AND
 MY SISTER BAILED ME OUT AGAIN.

1395
01:07:12,095 --> 01:07:14,329
   AND SO DID THIS-- THIS GUY

1396
01:07:14,331 --> 01:07:19,634
 THAT I MET WHO'S REALLY NICE,
    AND I REALLY LIKED HIM.

1397
01:07:19,636 --> 01:07:21,703
       INSTEAD OF DEALING
        WITH MY FEELINGS

1398
01:07:21,705 --> 01:07:25,106
      LIKE A MATURE ADULT,
        GROWN UP PERSON,

1399
01:07:25,108 --> 01:07:27,342
    I FUCKED A RANDOM DUDE.

1400
01:07:30,713 --> 01:07:34,115
       I JUST DON'T WANT
  TO LET ANYONE DOWN ANYMORE.

1401
01:07:34,117 --> 01:07:36,384
          I DON'T WANT
   TO LET MYSELF DOWN ANYMORE

1402
01:07:36,386 --> 01:07:38,119
      AND I WANT THIS PART
          OF MY LIFE--

1403
01:07:38,121 --> 01:07:40,288
  THIS WHOLE CHUNK TO BE OVER.

1404
01:07:40,290 --> 01:07:42,424
    AND THAT'S WHY I'M HERE
      BECAUSE I NEED HELP.

1405
01:07:46,295 --> 01:07:48,329
     I'M JUST FUCKING TIRED
          OF FUCKING.

1406
01:07:51,300 --> 01:07:54,135
             FUCK!

1407
01:07:54,137 --> 01:08:00,575
   SORRY, IT WASN'T MY TURN,
           I'M SORRY.

1408
01:08:00,577 --> 01:08:03,745
            YOU KNOW
    WHO WOULD'VE LOVED THAT?

1409
01:08:03,747 --> 01:08:06,381
             OPRAH.

1410
01:10:20,583 --> 01:10:22,250
       I HAVE PAYCHECKS!

1411
01:10:22,252 --> 01:10:23,618
    THIS ONE IS FOR MARTHA.

1412
01:10:23,620 --> 01:10:25,253
          THAT'S YOU?

1413
01:10:25,255 --> 01:10:29,257
    AND THIS IS FOR SHANNON,
        YOUR BIG SISTER.

1414
01:10:29,259 --> 01:10:32,727
      SHE'S GOING TO HAVE
   TO PICK HERS UP. SHE QUIT.

1415
01:10:32,729 --> 01:10:34,462
 AND WE'RE NOT TALKING ANYMORE.

1416
01:10:34,464 --> 01:10:36,631
            WHY NOT?

1417
01:10:36,633 --> 01:10:37,799
           LET'S SEE.

1418
01:10:37,801 --> 01:10:39,734
  SHE'S A LIAR, SHE'S SELFISH,

1419
01:10:39,736 --> 01:10:42,003
       SHE'S UNGRATEFUL,
         AND SHE CAN'T
     GET HER LIFE TOGETHER.

1420
01:10:42,005 --> 01:10:43,605
   IT'S ACTUALLY REALLY SAD.

1421
01:10:43,607 --> 01:10:44,706
        MY SISTER SUCKS.

1422
01:10:44,708 --> 01:10:46,541
       WHY DOES SHE SUCK?

1423
01:10:46,543 --> 01:10:49,477
 WERE YOU NOT LISTENING, JERRY?
I JUST TOLD YOU THE WHOLE THING.

1424
01:10:49,479 --> 01:10:51,579
    SHE'S A PAIN IN THE ASS!

1425
01:10:51,581 --> 01:10:53,014
              WHY?

1426
01:10:53,016 --> 01:10:55,683
     BECAUSE SHE JUST DOES
  WHATEVER THE HELL SHE WANTS,

1427
01:10:55,685 --> 01:11:00,488
      AND SHE DOESN'T CARE
  WHO SHE HURTS ALONG THE WAY.

1428
01:11:00,490 --> 01:11:04,392
    I MEAN, I DID EVERYTHING
        I COULD FOR HER.

1429
01:11:04,394 --> 01:11:07,729
      I GOT HER THIS JOB,
   LET HER STAY AT MY PLACE,

1430
01:11:07,731 --> 01:11:10,598
 AND IT'S LIKE SHE JUST DIDN'T
      EVEN WANT ANY OF IT.

1431
01:11:10,600 --> 01:11:13,768
 WELL, IF SHE DIDN'T WANT HELP,
     WHY DID YOU HELP HER?

1432
01:11:14,903 --> 01:11:16,471
         I DON'T KNOW.

1433
01:11:16,473 --> 01:11:18,573
   SOUNDS LIKE YOU NEED HELP.

1434
01:11:20,643 --> 01:11:24,379
             UH...
     I DON'T NEED ANY HELP.

1435
01:11:24,381 --> 01:11:28,416
    YOU WORRY TOO MUCH ABOUT
 YOUR SISTER AND NOT YOURSELF.

1436
01:11:28,418 --> 01:11:30,451
    MY LIFE IS PRETTY SWEET.

1437
01:11:30,453 --> 01:11:31,986
        IT'S NOT SWEET.

1438
01:11:31,988 --> 01:11:36,291
      YOU LIVE ALL ALONE.
  AND YOU'RE A MAID IN FRESNO.

1439
01:11:36,293 --> 01:11:37,825
       YOU'RE A MAID TOO,
           YOU KNOW.

1440
01:11:37,827 --> 01:11:39,861
      YES, BUT I'M BETTER
          THAN A MAID.

1441
01:11:39,863 --> 01:11:41,763
        EXECUTIVE MAID!

1442
01:11:41,765 --> 01:11:43,998
  AND I HAVE SEXY GIRLFRIEND.

1443
01:11:49,071 --> 01:11:52,340
YEAH,
      CAN YOU JUST, LIKE,
   PUT THEM BACK RIGHT AWAY.

1444
01:11:52,342 --> 01:11:54,542
     'CAUSE THEY'RE ALWAYS
      GETTING TANGLED UP.

1445
01:11:58,714 --> 01:12:00,648
     KELLY, YOU DON'T HAVE
        TO HIDE FROM ME.

1446
01:12:00,650 --> 01:12:03,651
   HEY, ALICIA IS WORKING OUT
      AT PRESTOWN CROSSFIT

1447
01:12:03,653 --> 01:12:05,987
     SO YOU SHOULD GO SIGN
           UP THERE.

1448
01:12:05,989 --> 01:12:08,623
    I DON'T WANT TO SAY "HI"
           TO ALICIA

1449
01:12:08,625 --> 01:12:11,526
   I WANT TO SAY "HI" TO YOU,
             KELLY.

1450
01:12:11,528 --> 01:12:12,694
              HI.

1451
01:12:19,768 --> 01:12:23,604
  I WANT TO APOLOGIZE TO YOU,
             OKAY?

1452
01:12:23,606 --> 01:12:26,541
           I'M SORRY.

1453
01:12:26,543 --> 01:12:29,010
        I WASN'T MYSELF.

1454
01:12:29,012 --> 01:12:32,714
YEAH, JUST A LOT OF WEIRD STUFF
    WAS GOING ON IN MY LIFE.

1455
01:12:32,716 --> 01:12:34,916
      YOU SAY YOUR SISTER
    OR YOUR EX ONE MORE TIME

1456
01:12:34,918 --> 01:12:37,018
    I WILL LITERALLY VOMIT,
           RIGHT NOW.

1457
01:12:37,020 --> 01:12:39,020
         WELL, I WON'T.

1458
01:12:39,022 --> 01:12:42,023
    OKAY? BECAUSE NEITHER OF
  THEM ARE IN MY LIFE ANYMORE.

1459
01:12:42,025 --> 01:12:43,891
       I MEAN IT'S GOOD!

1460
01:12:43,893 --> 01:12:46,361
    LIKE FOR THE FIRST TIME
           IN MY LIFE

1461
01:12:46,363 --> 01:12:47,929
      I'M DOING STUFF JUST
          FOR MYSELF.

1462
01:12:47,931 --> 01:12:50,865
     LIKE, I GOT A PEDICURE
           YESTERDAY

1463
01:12:50,867 --> 01:12:55,436
   AND I TOOK A BUBBLE BATH,
           YOU KNOW?

1464
01:12:55,438 --> 01:12:57,004
     WOW, YOU TOOK A BATH.

1465
01:12:57,006 --> 01:12:58,740
             YEAH.

1466
01:12:58,742 --> 01:13:03,678
  AND NOW I'M DOING THIS OTHER
  THING I REALLY WANTED TO DO,

1467
01:13:03,680 --> 01:13:05,580
       TALKING TO A GIRL
  WHO I THINK IS PRETTY COOL.

1468
01:13:08,150 --> 01:13:11,452
      I REALLY LIKED YOU.

1469
01:13:11,454 --> 01:13:12,653
       I STILL LIKE YOU.

1470
01:13:14,957 --> 01:13:17,158
             OKAY.

1471
01:13:17,160 --> 01:13:19,994
       BUT IF YOUR SISTER
        AND YOUR EX ARE,

1472
01:13:19,996 --> 01:13:22,563
         LIKE, TOTALLY
       OUT OF THE PICTURE
         FOR REAL THEN

1473
01:13:22,565 --> 01:13:24,632
  WHAT ARE YOU POSSIBLY GOING
      TO USE AS AN EXCUSE

1474
01:13:24,634 --> 01:13:26,834
     NOT TO GO OUT WITH ME
            TONIGHT?

1475
01:13:26,836 --> 01:13:28,870
            TONIGHT.

1476
01:13:28,872 --> 01:13:30,571
            NOTHING.

1477
01:13:30,573 --> 01:13:34,742
          NEWSFLASH--
         I'M AVAILABLE.

1478
01:13:34,744 --> 01:13:37,512
           - REALLY?
          - BIG TIME.

1479
01:13:46,189 --> 01:13:48,689
       YO, YO, YO! GURU!

1480
01:13:48,691 --> 01:13:50,691
      DO YOU REMEMBER ME?

1481
01:13:50,693 --> 01:13:52,460
        I THINK YOU HAVE
       THE WRONG PERSON.

1482
01:13:52,462 --> 01:13:54,162
            NO, NO.
     YOU DON'T REMEMBER ME?

1483
01:13:54,164 --> 01:13:56,798
        MY PARENTS HAD A
       HOUSE THAT SMELLED
      LIKE DIRTY DIAPERS?

1484
01:13:56,800 --> 01:13:58,032
     DOES THAT RING A BELL?

1485
01:13:58,034 --> 01:14:00,067
             - NO.
- YOU REMEMBER THIS PRETTY FACE?

1486
01:14:02,704 --> 01:14:04,172
           YEAH, HI!

1487
01:14:04,174 --> 01:14:06,140
 YOU GOT ANYMORE AWESOME WORDS
       OF WISDOM FOR ME?

1488
01:14:06,142 --> 01:14:07,608
          OH, I DON'T.

1489
01:14:07,610 --> 01:14:10,912
       I'M KIND OF OUT OF
       THE GURU BUSINESS.

1490
01:14:10,914 --> 01:14:12,046
             WHAT?

1491
01:14:12,048 --> 01:14:14,449
          I'M WORKING
      AT FOSTER FARMS NOW.

1492
01:14:14,451 --> 01:14:18,219
 OH WELL THAT'S GOOD FOR FOSTER
    FARMS BUT BAD FOR GURUS.

1493
01:14:18,221 --> 01:14:20,521
   YOU WERE SO GOOD AT THAT!

1494
01:14:20,523 --> 01:14:22,190
       I GOT TO TELL YOU
     MY WHOLE LIFE CHANGED

1495
01:14:22,192 --> 01:14:23,658
      BECAUSE OF THE STUFF
          YOU TOLD ME.

1496
01:14:23,660 --> 01:14:25,059
          REALLY, HOW?

1497
01:14:25,061 --> 01:14:26,627
        I SOLD THE VAN.

1498
01:14:26,629 --> 01:14:28,896
       I'M PAWNED BORIS'
         BRONZE MEDAL.

1499
01:14:28,898 --> 01:14:31,199
    I SOLD MY PARENTS' HOUSE
    FOR A SHITLOAD OF MONEY.

1500
01:14:31,201 --> 01:14:32,633
      I FIGURED THEY'D BE
       BETTER OFF ROTTING

1501
01:14:32,635 --> 01:14:34,001
      IN THE NURSING HOME,
           YOU KNOW.

1502
01:14:34,003 --> 01:14:35,570
     GOT A REAL GOOD PRICE
       ON A NURSING HOME,

1503
01:14:35,572 --> 01:14:37,605
   ONE OF THE CHEAPEST ONES.

1504
01:14:37,607 --> 01:14:40,575
      AND THAT WAS REALLY
      ALL BECAUSE OF YOU,
      I HAVE TO BE HONEST.

1505
01:14:40,577 --> 01:14:42,910
        AND I'M GETTING
        A CHIN IMPLANT.

1506
01:14:42,912 --> 01:14:45,112
          I NEVER SAID
       ANY OF THAT STUFF.

1507
01:14:45,114 --> 01:14:48,049
         LISTEN, GURU,
        I FELT YOUR VIBE
       AND I RAN WITH IT.

1508
01:14:48,051 --> 01:14:49,984
     IF YOU EVER SEE BORIS
          YOU TELL HIM

1509
01:14:49,986 --> 01:14:52,119
        WE'RE BETTER OFF
   WITHOUT EACH OTHER, OKAY?

1510
01:14:52,121 --> 01:14:54,622
    SIBLINGS CAN REALLY SINK
     EACH OTHER, YOU KNOW?

1511
01:14:54,624 --> 01:14:57,792
     TELL HIM I SAID THAT,
             OKAY?

1512
01:14:57,794 --> 01:15:00,495
     TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF!
            NAMASTE!

1513
01:16:33,822 --> 01:16:36,157
<i> 911, WHAT'S</i>
        <i> YOUR EMERGENCY?</i>

1514
01:16:36,159 --> 01:16:40,628
 IT'S NOT REALLY AN EMERGENCY.

1515
01:16:40,630 --> 01:16:44,966
        I KILLED A GUY,
       SO SOMEONE SHOULD
   PROBABLY COME AND GET ME.

1516
01:16:44,968 --> 01:16:47,935
         <i> PLEASE HOLD.</i>

1517
01:16:47,937 --> 01:16:50,304
     <i> NOW, I'LL CONNECT YOU</i>
     <i> TO THE FRESNO POLICE.</i>

1518

1519
01:16:52,342 --> 01:16:55,276

       <i> BEEN DISPATCHED.</i>

1520
01:16:55,278 --> 01:16:58,045
       NO, YOU DON'T HAVE
    TO SEND THE PARAMEDICS.

1521
01:16:58,047 --> 01:17:00,681
   IT WAS A LITTLE WHILE AGO.

1522
01:17:00,683 --> 01:17:02,783
      IT WAS AN ACCIDENT,

1523
01:17:02,785 --> 01:17:06,787
  I'M SURE EVERYONE SAYS THAT,
      BUT IT, LIKE REALLY
        WAS AN ACCIDENT.

1524
01:17:06,789 --> 01:17:08,656
       WELL, DO YOU THINK
    THAT MAYBE SOMEONE COULD

1525
01:17:08,658 --> 01:17:10,825
   JUST COME HERE AND GET ME
  BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE A CAR?

1526
01:17:13,629 --> 01:17:14,829
   THAT'S A REALLY FAR WALK.

1527
01:17:21,703 --> 01:17:24,739
<i> SO ANYWAY, SHAN, I'M</i>
<i>GLAD YOU'RE GETTING MY LETTERS.</i>

1528
01:17:24,741 --> 01:17:27,008
<i>I MISS YOU BUT I'M KIND OF GLAD</i>
        <i> YOU'RE IN JAIL.</i>

1529
01:17:27,010 --> 01:17:29,010
          <i> AND I MEAN</i>
    <i> THAT IN THE NICEST WAY.</i>

1530
01:17:29,012 --> 01:17:31,112
        <i> YOU BETTER LOOK</i>
  <i> LIKE LINDA HAMILTON IN "T2"</i>

1531
01:17:31,114 --> 01:17:33,881
       <i> WHEN YOU GET OUT.</i>
        <i> BABY GOT BACK!</i>

1532
01:17:33,883 --> 01:17:36,017

1533

   <i> AND STAY OUT OF TROUBLE.</i>

1535
01:17:44,894 --> 01:17:48,229
<i> MARTHA.</i>

1536

       <i> P.S., I HATE YOU</i>
   <i> WHICH IN CASE YOU FORGOT</i>

1537
01:17:54,103 --> 01:17:56,704
<i>MEANS I LOVE YOU LIKE A SISTER.</i>

1538
01:18:24,467 --> 01:18:28,069
   I DID LEARN THIS THIS FROM
       "HOT KNOCKERS 4."

1539
01:18:28,071 --> 01:18:29,437
           OH, BABY.

1540
01:18:29,439 --> 01:18:31,772
          SHAN! STOP,
        YOUR MY SISTER.

1541
01:18:31,774 --> 01:18:33,274
       HOLD STILL, BABY.

1542
01:18:33,276 --> 01:18:35,810
      THANK YOU. YOU ARE--
   YOU HAVE A TREASURE TROVE.

1543
01:18:35,812 --> 01:18:38,312
          YOU'RE LIKE
        THE MAYA ANGELOU
        OF DICK SUCKING,

1544
01:18:38,314 --> 01:18:39,346
        AND I MEAN THAT.

1545
01:18:39,348 --> 01:18:41,849
 IT WAS JUST A BIG URINE CAKE.

1546
01:18:45,487 --> 01:18:50,157
IT'S TRUE.
     - I GOT IT! I GOT IT!

1547
01:18:50,159 --> 01:18:53,027
          I WAS JUST--
 I WAS JUST A BIG URINAL CAKE.

1548
01:18:53,029 --> 01:18:58,399
     THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY--
           I'M SORRY.

1549
01:18:58,401 --> 01:19:00,267
     EVERYONE'S EXCITED BUT
 I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENING.

1550
01:19:00,269 --> 01:19:01,936
       LIKE, LIKE, LIKE!

1551
01:19:01,938 --> 01:19:04,772

1552
01:19:04,774 --> 01:19:07,942
         MAYBE IT'S ME,
    MAYBE IT'S JERRY GARCIA,

1553
01:19:07,944 --> 01:19:10,511
     MAYBE IT'S COUSIN IT.
         NOBODY KNOWS.

1554
01:19:10,513 --> 01:19:14,181
