News on Parade!

1953

4
00:00:36,689 --> 00:00:38,849
Magic comes to Tinseltown.

5
00:00:39,601 --> 00:00:41,236
Not since this year's sensation,

6
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:43,503
a frozen 4 course
meal on a tray,

7
00:00:43,527 --> 00:00:46,593
have people and the press been
caught up in such a frenzy.

8
00:00:47,379 --> 00:00:50,056
Everybody wants more
magic in their lives.

9
00:00:51,687 --> 00:00:55,961
Licensed practitioners of magic are
popping up like rabbits in a hat trick.

10
00:00:57,598 --> 00:00:59,265
Don't like the look
of your house?

11
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:03,587
This licensed practitioner
will transform every room.

12
00:01:05,424 --> 00:01:08,024
How's this for instant
interior decorating?

13
00:01:09,133 --> 00:01:11,533
There's even
do-it-yourself magic.

14
00:01:11,613 --> 00:01:14,653
Mr. and Mrs. America
are getting into the act.

15
00:01:15,258 --> 00:01:18,764
Say... looks like this
youngster's really moving up.

16
00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:23,209
Licensed magic practitioners and their
products may be on the up and up,

17
00:01:23,342 --> 00:01:27,146
but there are others who's use
of magic is down and dirty!

18
00:01:27,171 --> 00:01:32,033
Unlicensed, and underground.
They represent magic's dark side.

19
00:01:32,213 --> 00:01:35,639
That raised the suspicions of
dynamic Senator Larson Crockett.

20
00:01:35,927 --> 00:01:38,200
He's leading an
anti-magic crusade!

21
00:01:38,666 --> 00:01:41,032
His target: Tinseltown!

22
00:01:41,226 --> 00:01:45,146
Senator Crockett's convinced that
magic, licensed or unlicensed,

23
00:01:45,205 --> 00:01:50,104
is un-American, infiltrating our lives,
and undermining the American family.

24
00:01:50,275 --> 00:01:54,561
Why work, why worship, if there's
magic to make things easy?

25
00:01:55,032 --> 00:01:59,814
For some of Hollywood's biggest stars and
studio moguls, it's time to name names!

26
00:01:59,907 --> 00:02:02,573
Politicians and
prestidigitators at war.

27
00:02:02,598 --> 00:02:06,740
Senator Crockett's political muscle
verses magic in Hollywood.

28
00:02:06,892 --> 00:02:11,759
From Magic California,
this is News on Parade.

29
00:02:35,892 --> 00:02:36,919
Magic.

30
00:02:37,486 --> 00:02:38,512
Magic!

31
00:02:39,572 --> 00:02:42,379
The word conjures
images of sloth,

32
00:02:42,733 --> 00:02:45,406
degeneracy, and corruption.

33
00:02:46,019 --> 00:02:50,513
I brought my committee to Los
Angeles where this plague began

34
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:55,466
- and I will not rest...
- What's he getting so worked up about?

35
00:02:55,532 --> 00:02:57,941
Ah, some people have
a problem with magic.

36
00:02:57,966 --> 00:03:00,413
What's to worry, I mean, it just
makes things easier, right?

37
00:03:00,826 --> 00:03:02,925
Never touch the stuff myself.

38
00:03:05,533 --> 00:03:08,286
Humph...that's some
lifeline you got there.

39
00:03:09,261 --> 00:03:10,383
I got a good life.

40
00:03:10,508 --> 00:03:12,032
Oh yeah, what's ya do?

41
00:03:12,681 --> 00:03:14,328
I'm looking for somebody.

42
00:03:14,834 --> 00:03:18,041
Someone in particular, or just someone
with an interesting outlook on things?

43
00:03:18,126 --> 00:03:19,999
Na, somebody in particular.

44
00:03:20,152 --> 00:03:22,952
He owes his ex-wife
$7,000 bucks!

45
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:26,813
He moved and forgot
to drop the lady a card.

46
00:03:27,862 --> 00:03:30,153
So what, the little woman
hired you to find someone.

47
00:03:30,178 --> 00:03:32,762
- What are you, a detective, or something?
- Or something.

48
00:03:33,178 --> 00:03:35,682
When you find the guy,
you gonna break his legs?

49
00:03:38,146 --> 00:03:39,728
Thanks for the conversation.

50
00:03:39,885 --> 00:03:43,376
- Oh, thank you, and take a card.
- Don't mind if I do.

51
00:03:44,546 --> 00:03:46,146
Me, I'm old fashioned

52
00:03:46,171 --> 00:03:48,855
Man makes a promise, I
figure he should keep it.

53
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:50,271
You talking to me?

54
00:03:50,377 --> 00:03:53,466
There's a lady who'd like to have
a few words with you, Sidney!

55
00:03:53,559 --> 00:03:56,069
She got the last penny she's
ever gonna get from me.

56
00:03:57,615 --> 00:03:59,888
I don't think so.

57
00:04:26,732 --> 00:04:29,831
That's $7,000 bucks
back alimony to you!

58
00:04:34,158 --> 00:04:37,725
Sidney, your wife and
(??) wants to see you.

59
00:04:39,708 --> 00:04:41,230
It started off small,

60
00:04:41,355 --> 00:04:44,130
it wasn't a conspiracy or
anything, it was like a,

61
00:04:44,154 --> 00:04:45,722
it was just like a fad!

62
00:04:46,298 --> 00:04:47,885
Somebody bent a spoon,

63
00:04:48,038 --> 00:04:49,714
or levitated their dog.

64
00:04:49,818 --> 00:04:52,285
Next thing you knew, it
was starting to spread.

65
00:04:52,966 --> 00:04:55,098
Pretty soon the whole
neighborhood was doing it.

66
00:04:55,226 --> 00:04:56,574
And in a little while,

67
00:04:56,599 --> 00:04:58,239
it was all over the place,

68
00:04:58,539 --> 00:05:00,092
like a Tupperware party

69
00:05:00,566 --> 00:05:02,414
That's him, that's the louse!

70
00:05:02,438 --> 00:05:04,981
You're walking pretty straight
for a man with no backbone.

71
00:05:05,005 --> 00:05:08,156
I'm gonna let you two lovebirds
have some time alone.

72
00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:09,770
Get in! Now!

73
00:05:10,156 --> 00:05:11,543
Good luck, Sidney.

74
00:05:11,984 --> 00:05:13,731
Why didn't you just shoot me?

75
00:05:22,245 --> 00:05:24,433
Still, I never
thought it was evil.

76
00:05:24,457 --> 00:05:26,951
It was just natural.
It's human curiosity.

77
00:05:27,533 --> 00:05:29,708
At worst, I thought
it was a crutch.

78
00:05:29,733 --> 00:05:31,897
Magic can make people lazy,

79
00:05:31,921 --> 00:05:33,583
and if you're not careful,

80
00:05:33,667 --> 00:05:35,202
it can creep up on ya.

81
00:05:35,966 --> 00:05:38,132
Instead of taking out the trash,

82
00:05:38,133 --> 00:05:39,853
the trash takes out itself.

83
00:05:39,878 --> 00:05:42,986
Instead of washing the dishes,
you just encourage them.

84
00:05:43,225 --> 00:05:45,199
Nobody sees it happen to them,

85
00:05:45,286 --> 00:05:46,481
it just happens

86
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:49,058
So it makes my
job a little tougher,

87
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:51,833
but it's nothing to
get hysterical about.

88
00:05:52,466 --> 00:05:55,581
Last year, it was hula hoops,
and Senator Crockett

89
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:58,332
never held congressional
hearings about that.

90
00:05:58,678 --> 00:06:01,585
Sure, I get tempted to
use it, who doesn't?

91
00:06:02,005 --> 00:06:05,011
But in my business, it's
better just to work clean.

92
00:06:06,444 --> 00:06:08,271
I knew a private eye

93
00:06:08,543 --> 00:06:10,917
who hired a witch to
put a tail on a guy,

94
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:14,673
and the poor bastard had to
have it surgically removed.

95
00:06:15,913 --> 00:06:18,900
Some things just
aren't worth it.

96
00:06:19,493 --> 00:06:20,793
Mr. Lovecraft?

97
00:06:26,118 --> 00:06:27,499
I'm Kim Hudson.

98
00:06:29,606 --> 00:06:30,907
You're in the movies.

99
00:06:31,233 --> 00:06:33,887
Which one of my
efforts have you seen?

100
00:06:35,901 --> 00:06:37,317
I don't remember the title.

101
00:06:38,365 --> 00:06:40,166
You were in a bathtub
full of bubbles,

102
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,080
and you had your,

103
00:06:42,919 --> 00:06:44,478
big toe stuck in a faucet.

104
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,152
Let's do it.

105
00:06:49,379 --> 00:06:50,919
The name of the picture!

106
00:06:51,772 --> 00:06:52,813
Let's do it.

107
00:06:53,906 --> 00:06:56,306
It was a very
sophisticated comedy.

108
00:06:57,492 --> 00:06:59,306
You know the part I liked best,

109
00:07:00,239 --> 00:07:01,806
when the fat plumber came in.

110
00:07:05,219 --> 00:07:06,785
So...

111
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:09,240
What can I do you
for, Miss Hudson?

112
00:07:09,271 --> 00:07:11,613
Actually, it's Mrs. Gotlieb.

113
00:07:13,125 --> 00:07:16,277
I'm married to N.J. Gotlieb.

114
00:07:16,438 --> 00:07:17,631
The producer?

115
00:07:17,707 --> 00:07:19,238
There's only one.

116
00:07:20,266 --> 00:07:24,792
And, I have reason to believe
he's being unfaithful to me.

117
00:07:25,679 --> 00:07:27,131
What sort of reason?

118
00:07:28,566 --> 00:07:30,978
Nicky's producing my
new picture, Palisade.

119
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,906
He hired a girl for a walk-on,

120
00:07:34,832 --> 00:07:36,486
but her part keeps getting

121
00:07:37,059 --> 00:07:39,232
bigger and bigger.

122
00:07:40,299 --> 00:07:43,553
Now, you'd have to be as dumb
as I look, not to figure it out.

123
00:07:44,866 --> 00:07:47,832
Forty-five dollars a day,
plus gas and expenses.

124
00:07:51,133 --> 00:07:54,813
Just give me something solid
I can take to my lawyers.

125
00:07:55,946 --> 00:07:58,319
I'm sure, whatever he's up to,

126
00:08:00,033 --> 00:08:01,799
it'll be cheap,

127
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,168
tawdry,

128
00:08:04,407 --> 00:08:06,114
and decidedly third rate.

129
00:08:10,026 --> 00:08:11,052
Please.

130
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:39,166
We gather together and close this circle
to repute the whispers in the darkness.

131
00:08:39,812 --> 00:08:42,352
Cord stronger than a thread,

132
00:08:42,377 --> 00:08:45,017
rope stronger than a cord.

133
00:08:46,105 --> 00:08:47,230
A pledge,

134
00:08:47,825 --> 00:08:48,992
a bond,

135
00:08:50,033 --> 00:08:51,173
a sacrifice.

136
00:09:08,422 --> 00:09:10,629
- Hi, Phil.
- Trudy.

137
00:09:10,872 --> 00:09:12,449
Come to join the coven?

138
00:09:13,116 --> 00:09:14,502
Not today, angel.

139
00:09:14,672 --> 00:09:17,206
Anytime you want,
Phil. Anytime at all.

140
00:09:17,573 --> 00:09:19,359
You be careful
what you wish for.

141
00:09:23,226 --> 00:09:25,915
Who's that producer your
working for at Palisade?

142
00:09:26,026 --> 00:09:27,774
- N.J. Gotlieb.
- That's the right one.

143
00:09:27,798 --> 00:09:30,858
- I'm on my way there right now.
- You want a lift?

144
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:34,220
Thank you.

145
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:54,108
What's the story on Gotlieb?

146
00:09:55,059 --> 00:09:56,268
He's short.

147
00:09:57,033 --> 00:09:59,502
You have to be careful
with short men.

148
00:09:59,766 --> 00:10:01,967
Their auras are compressed.

149
00:10:03,845 --> 00:10:06,201
Is he the sort of man who
would cheat on his wife?

150
00:10:07,089 --> 00:10:09,002
Only if it occurred to him?

151
00:10:10,604 --> 00:10:11,801
What is that stuff?

152
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:15,953
You really don't want to know.

153
00:10:46,779 --> 00:10:48,119
Watch your step, sir.

154
00:10:56,734 --> 00:10:57,781
We all set?

155
00:10:58,266 --> 00:10:59,376
I'm ready.

156
00:10:59,530 --> 00:11:00,564
All right!

157
00:11:00,744 --> 00:11:01,764
Hit it!

158
00:11:02,133 --> 00:11:03,467
Mr. Gotlieb.

159
00:11:05,926 --> 00:11:08,594
Have you got any gold
fillings in your teeth?

160
00:11:10,172 --> 00:11:12,318
- What's it to you?
- Nothing,

161
00:11:12,966 --> 00:11:16,692
it's just that they tend to
melt if you stand too close.

162
00:11:50,685 --> 00:11:51,972
Mind your teeth.

163
00:12:06,175 --> 00:12:09,821
Fair is foul and foul is fair.

164
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:14,866
Hover through the
fog, and the filthy air!

165
00:12:37,989 --> 00:12:39,882
What place is this?

166
00:12:43,917 --> 00:12:46,377
Aw, it's a real pleasure, Bill.

167
00:12:46,477 --> 00:12:48,277
Welcome to Hollywood.

168
00:12:48,533 --> 00:12:49,541
Holly...wood?

169
00:12:49,565 --> 00:12:52,014
I got a couple of people
I'd like you to say hello to.

170
00:12:52,038 --> 00:12:54,946
I-I, am N.J. Gotlieb.

171
00:12:55,366 --> 00:12:59,854
This is Miss. Tracy Pinkem,
really something special.

172
00:12:59,879 --> 00:13:03,099
Absolutely love your stuff, when Nicky
said you'd be doing my additional dialogue

173
00:13:03,123 --> 00:13:04,779
Okay. Okay!

174
00:13:04,803 --> 00:13:06,916
This is Malcolm Purdy.

175
00:13:07,053 --> 00:13:09,098
- Head of production.
- Shakespeare, what an honor.

176
00:13:09,122 --> 00:13:12,846
- Armand Vacuole, business affairs.
- How do you do.

177
00:13:13,035 --> 00:13:16,348
- Ah, ah, Jim and Ted.
- Ted and Jim, actually.

178
00:13:16,441 --> 00:13:17,936
Yeah, whatever!

179
00:13:18,067 --> 00:13:20,502
Great writers. They'll
help you over the bumps.

180
00:13:20,832 --> 00:13:24,266
Ah! Trevor Bunt,
best director in town!

181
00:13:24,766 --> 00:13:30,032
And, Mr. Frank Krusnik, of
the William Morris agency.

182
00:13:32,786 --> 00:13:33,898
Who are you?

183
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,700
Oh! I'm-I'm with the witch.

184
00:13:38,793 --> 00:13:41,040
Ah, excuse me a
second, will you, Bill.

185
00:13:41,744 --> 00:13:44,526
Somebody get Bill
here a parking space.

186
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:47,918
Paint over whats-his-name,
that Nobel prize guy.

187
00:14:14,718 --> 00:14:16,450
Finn Macha.

188
00:14:16,474 --> 00:14:19,041
Moses on a pony, if
it isn't Phil Lovecraft.

189
00:14:19,122 --> 00:14:21,654
Well, how's the world
treating you, Dickface?

190
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:24,048
I thought you were in Chicago.

191
00:14:24,094 --> 00:14:25,999
I miss the friendly people,

192
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,300
and the orange groves.

193
00:14:27,365 --> 00:14:29,111
What are you doing for Gotlieb?

194
00:14:29,926 --> 00:14:31,392
Privileged information.

195
00:14:31,453 --> 00:14:33,413
But from one lodge
member to another,

196
00:14:33,733 --> 00:14:37,087
he called me in as a security
consultant and expeditor.

197
00:14:37,479 --> 00:14:39,199
I tie up loose ends.

198
00:14:39,612 --> 00:14:43,019
It seems to me they're still looking
for a couple of people you expedited.

199
00:14:44,019 --> 00:14:46,774
Are you still chasing naughty
husbands, Dickface?

200
00:14:46,798 --> 00:14:49,946
And drying the tears of those
poor lonely wifey-poos?

201
00:14:51,333 --> 00:14:52,441
Tell me something.

202
00:14:52,895 --> 00:14:54,002
Honestly.

203
00:14:55,546 --> 00:14:58,201
Do I look like I have
a dick on my face?

204
00:14:58,675 --> 00:15:00,396
That's why I like you, Phil.

205
00:15:03,333 --> 00:15:05,473
I like to take things apart.

206
00:15:06,031 --> 00:15:07,614
See how they work.

207
00:15:07,844 --> 00:15:10,838
Watches, phonographs, people.

208
00:15:11,458 --> 00:15:13,985
I like to see inside.

209
00:15:24,506 --> 00:15:25,527
Well,

210
00:15:25,732 --> 00:15:27,394
I'll see you around, Phil.

211
00:15:31,078 --> 00:15:32,629
I don't think so.

212
00:15:33,251 --> 00:15:34,829
Oh, there's no doubt about it.

213
00:15:34,854 --> 00:15:37,756
You and me, we've still
got business to settle.

214
00:15:54,926 --> 00:15:56,195
Who was that?

215
00:15:57,062 --> 00:15:58,502
It's somebody I know.

216
00:15:58,766 --> 00:16:00,502
He has a sour eye.

217
00:16:01,086 --> 00:16:04,619
The devil can put all manner
of mischief in an eye like that.

218
00:16:05,012 --> 00:16:07,365
If it were mine,
I'd pluck it out.

219
00:16:08,232 --> 00:16:09,740
Let's get outta here.

220
00:16:26,730 --> 00:16:29,317
I followed Gotlieb
up to Los Feliz

221
00:16:30,281 --> 00:16:32,814
I wish I had a rum punch
for every time somebody

222
00:16:32,839 --> 00:16:35,752
in my business followed
a car up to Los Feliz.

223
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:38,054
Look at the motion
picture industry, friends.

224
00:16:38,078 --> 00:16:39,967
Why do you think
everyone is beautiful?

225
00:16:40,057 --> 00:16:41,063
Magic!

226
00:16:41,087 --> 00:16:42,660
Why don't they ever get old?

227
00:16:42,738 --> 00:16:43,755
Magic!

228
00:16:43,779 --> 00:16:46,052
Why are their jokes
always funny?

229
00:16:46,666 --> 00:16:47,672
Magic!

230
00:16:55,379 --> 00:16:57,532
It was creepy up there.

231
00:16:58,890 --> 00:17:01,283
I cut my lights and stayed back.

232
00:17:03,239 --> 00:17:05,721
The last thing I needed
was to get turned to

233
00:17:05,746 --> 00:17:08,199
stone, or end up with
the body of a goat.

234
00:19:14,604 --> 00:19:15,611
Standing!

235
00:19:15,851 --> 00:19:17,224
In my dressing room.

236
00:19:17,414 --> 00:19:19,016
With my wardrobe lady.

237
00:19:19,146 --> 00:19:21,941
Being fitted into my costume!

238
00:19:22,653 --> 00:19:25,887
I'm a movie star,
she's a waitress.

239
00:19:26,566 --> 00:19:28,837
How do you think
that makes me feel?

240
00:19:29,226 --> 00:19:31,910
I gotta do what I think
is best for the picture.

241
00:19:32,126 --> 00:19:33,198
My picture.

242
00:19:33,495 --> 00:19:34,689
MY picture.

243
00:19:36,887 --> 00:19:38,554
You're replacing me

244
00:19:39,295 --> 00:19:41,335
with that skinny-ass car-hop!

245
00:19:41,933 --> 00:19:45,021
We're married, you crumb.
What will people think?

246
00:19:45,332 --> 00:19:47,518
Don't make a big
deal out of it, Kim!

247
00:19:48,259 --> 00:19:51,045
There are lots of other studios,
you'll land on your feet.

248
00:19:51,978 --> 00:19:53,731
You can't do this to me.

249
00:19:54,278 --> 00:19:55,593
What about our marriage?

250
00:19:55,617 --> 00:19:58,998
That wasn't a marriage,
that was a license to shop.

251
00:20:01,138 --> 00:20:03,144
What about my 3 year contract?!

252
00:20:03,367 --> 00:20:05,331
Have your people
talk to my people.

253
00:20:07,158 --> 00:20:09,638
The public won't stand for this!

254
00:20:11,126 --> 00:20:12,302
The public?

255
00:20:13,056 --> 00:20:16,951
What you fail to grasp is just
how replaceable you are!

256
00:20:16,975 --> 00:20:20,337
You're nothing but nice
tits, and a pleasant smile!

257
00:20:20,489 --> 00:20:23,789
You'll be forgotten before
you reach the gate!

258
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:31,527
This isn't the first time I've been
fucked in a producer's office.

259
00:20:48,699 --> 00:20:49,772
Just you.

260
00:20:49,797 --> 00:20:51,117
Not Dickens.

261
00:20:55,745 --> 00:20:56,964
N.J. Gotlieb.

262
00:20:57,751 --> 00:20:59,144
It's Harry Schrodinger.

263
00:21:00,219 --> 00:21:01,539
Five minutes!

264
00:21:06,091 --> 00:21:08,205
So, he won an Oscar.

265
00:21:08,418 --> 00:21:10,758
He hasn't had a
hit for five years!

266
00:21:11,366 --> 00:21:14,292
But I'm willing to give the rummy
another chance, because

267
00:21:14,533 --> 00:21:15,766
I'm sentimental.

268
00:21:16,266 --> 00:21:18,252
Tell him he's
got 'til 5 o'clock!

269
00:21:18,302 --> 00:21:20,017
Take it, or leave it!

270
00:22:23,041 --> 00:22:24,367
What do you want?

271
00:22:24,938 --> 00:22:26,331
I want to make my report.

272
00:22:26,603 --> 00:22:29,012
- Save it. You're fired.
- I am?

273
00:22:30,806 --> 00:22:33,091
You're fired. I'm fired.

274
00:22:33,139 --> 00:22:34,611
Everybody's fired.

275
00:22:34,879 --> 00:22:36,771
You want to know where
he went last night?

276
00:22:37,435 --> 00:22:39,442
I couldn't care less.

277
00:22:40,533 --> 00:22:43,362
He went to a big house in
the hills above Los Feliz.

278
00:22:45,473 --> 00:22:47,009
You said he went where?

279
00:22:47,593 --> 00:22:49,549
In a house on Glendower Avenue.

280
00:22:51,133 --> 00:22:53,973
- That cow.
- Now, what cow would that be?

281
00:22:54,596 --> 00:22:57,350
- Get that, will ya?
- No, you fired me, remember?

282
00:23:06,552 --> 00:23:07,862
Yeah, it's me.

283
00:23:19,908 --> 00:23:21,336
Am I in your way?

284
00:23:25,902 --> 00:23:27,509
Get them out of here.

285
00:23:28,673 --> 00:23:30,267
All right. Come on.

286
00:23:37,001 --> 00:23:38,015
Hi.

287
00:23:39,861 --> 00:23:41,223
What the hell are
you doing here?

288
00:23:41,247 --> 00:23:43,303
It's go to see you too,
Bradbury. What happened?

289
00:23:43,359 --> 00:23:44,494
Come on, give.

290
00:23:44,766 --> 00:23:46,746
I'm a friend of the
widows. What happened?

291
00:23:47,033 --> 00:23:49,766
Somebody put the big whammy on
Gotlieb and cut him down to size.

292
00:23:49,791 --> 00:23:50,806
Wow!

293
00:23:52,933 --> 00:23:53,745
And...

294
00:23:53,769 --> 00:23:56,527
Ever see two dogs play
tug-of-war with a bone?

295
00:23:57,982 --> 00:24:01,443
Forget the gurney, you can get
him out of here in a lunch pail.

296
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:07,414
Are you thinking of something?

297
00:24:07,528 --> 00:24:09,613
I'm thinking that, according
to this lady, the last

298
00:24:09,638 --> 00:24:11,914
person to see Gotlieb
before he got small

299
00:24:11,939 --> 00:24:13,614
was your friend the widow.

300
00:24:16,529 --> 00:24:20,596
Okay. Okay. Break it up. This is
a police investigation. Come on.

301
00:24:21,606 --> 00:24:22,899
Lt. Bradbury.

302
00:24:22,953 --> 00:24:24,421
Heard good things about you.

303
00:24:24,445 --> 00:24:25,866
Larson Crockett.

304
00:24:26,806 --> 00:24:29,204
What's being done about
this ghastly business?

305
00:24:29,433 --> 00:24:30,604
We're working on it.

306
00:24:30,985 --> 00:24:32,024
Good!

307
00:24:32,366 --> 00:24:35,472
This is just another example
of how magic has shot its

308
00:24:35,497 --> 00:24:38,463
sinister tentacles into the
motion picture industry.

309
00:24:38,506 --> 00:24:44,581
I give my personal pledge that soon a new
day will dawn on a witch free America.

310
00:24:44,866 --> 00:24:48,467
A more wholesome country,
as we proceed with our

311
00:24:48,492 --> 00:24:51,914
Los Angeles hearings and
prepare our patriotism rally...

312
00:24:51,938 --> 00:24:54,136
I thought the magic
was trouble, but now...

313
00:24:54,503 --> 00:24:56,504
Now that they're trying
to outlaw the stuff...

314
00:24:56,666 --> 00:24:58,055
How come I'm not so happy?

315
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:00,360
If God doesn't destroy Hollywood

316
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:04,311
He owes Sodom and
Gomorrah an apology.

317
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:11,506
As my dear friend Norman Desmond is so fond
of saying, maybe the pictures got small.

318
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:14,308
But Nicky Gotlieb
never got small.

319
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:16,286
Well, he did, actually.

320
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:18,055
But not until the very end.

321
00:25:18,079 --> 00:25:19,863
When he got really small.

322
00:25:20,032 --> 00:25:20,960
Onerous?

323
00:25:20,984 --> 00:25:22,785
You may be the head of a studio.

324
00:25:23,185 --> 00:25:25,219
You may be a big star.

325
00:25:25,251 --> 00:25:28,726
In heaven, we are
all just bit players.

326
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:32,102
Under contract to the
one who discovered us.

327
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:33,961
Cecil B. DeMille.

328
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:35,768
Fatty Arbuckle.

329
00:25:36,432 --> 00:25:37,617
Nicky Gotlieb.

330
00:25:37,675 --> 00:25:39,758
All just walk-ons.

331
00:25:39,915 --> 00:25:41,969
In the part we
were born to play.

332
00:25:42,986 --> 00:25:44,492
God's little extra.

333
00:25:44,792 --> 00:25:47,752
In Nicky's case,
God's very-little extra.

334
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:50,646
God's littlest extra.

335
00:25:50,966 --> 00:25:54,289
But no less dear to God,
as he was dear to us.

336
00:25:55,913 --> 00:25:58,537
So, farewell, N.J. Gotlieb.

337
00:25:58,933 --> 00:26:01,297
We have reached
the final fade-out.

338
00:26:02,233 --> 00:26:03,719
But, dear friends.

339
00:26:04,366 --> 00:26:06,614
Think of it not so
much as a fade-out,

340
00:26:06,638 --> 00:26:09,252
but as a dissolve
for a fair world.

341
00:26:09,277 --> 00:26:10,466
We have to talk.

342
00:26:12,233 --> 00:26:14,452
Awful nice, you showing
up for his funeral.

343
00:26:14,557 --> 00:26:15,992
I am the widow.

344
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:18,701
Besides, it'd look
funny if I didn't come.

345
00:26:18,725 --> 00:26:20,294
People might get the wrong idea.

346
00:26:20,319 --> 00:26:21,902
And what idea would that be?

347
00:26:22,025 --> 00:26:23,326
I wanna hire you.

348
00:26:23,919 --> 00:26:26,516
You hire me. You fire me. Now
you wanna hire me again.

349
00:26:26,585 --> 00:26:28,730
I think the police
think I killed Nicky.

350
00:26:28,873 --> 00:26:30,653
- I think you're right.
- I didn't.

351
00:26:30,678 --> 00:26:31,709
Uh-huh.

352
00:26:31,806 --> 00:26:33,048
You believe me, don't you?

353
00:26:33,073 --> 00:26:35,506
Doesn't matter what I believe,
matters what I can prove.

354
00:26:36,579 --> 00:26:37,781
Well, prove it.

355
00:26:37,999 --> 00:26:39,621
Oh! Well, you're
tough, aren't you?

356
00:26:39,645 --> 00:26:40,678
That's me.

357
00:26:40,703 --> 00:26:44,218
Are you tough enough to put your
husband in that parakeet coffin?

358
00:26:45,613 --> 00:26:48,193
Don't strain yourself trying
to figure me out, Lovecraft.

359
00:26:48,366 --> 00:26:50,793
Just find out who killed Nicky,
and get me off the hook.

360
00:26:50,818 --> 00:26:52,493
Can you get the keys to his car?

361
00:26:52,749 --> 00:26:53,624
His car?

362
00:26:53,649 --> 00:26:55,463
The Lincoln he was
driving the other night.

363
00:26:55,646 --> 00:26:57,020
Well, I can get them for you.

364
00:26:58,140 --> 00:27:00,507
I'll start with that, and the
house on Glendower.

365
00:27:00,741 --> 00:27:02,307
Forget about the
house on Glendower.

366
00:27:02,332 --> 00:27:04,035
There's nothing there
you have to know about.

367
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:07,046
- Well, I'll decide that for myself.
- Stay clear of that place.

368
00:27:07,071 --> 00:27:09,957
You know the cops are only going
to work as hard as they have to.

369
00:27:10,615 --> 00:27:13,451
If the frame fits,
you're gonna wear it.

370
00:27:16,299 --> 00:27:18,379
The keys to the Lincoln
will be at the house.

371
00:28:00,233 --> 00:28:02,469
Somebody slipped me a
Mickey the other night.

372
00:28:03,198 --> 00:28:04,795
What kind of a Mickey?

373
00:28:06,081 --> 00:28:08,408
A raven landed on
the hood of my car.

374
00:28:08,833 --> 00:28:10,961
And the next thing I
know, it's morning.

375
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:13,931
Ooh, nice touch!

376
00:28:13,955 --> 00:28:16,983
I man, you don't see that kind of
workmanship around these days.

377
00:28:17,008 --> 00:28:18,630
It's usually just frogs.

378
00:28:18,733 --> 00:28:20,874
Not even toads, just frogs.

379
00:28:21,238 --> 00:28:23,054
Oh, but yours...

380
00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:26,355
Anyway, what was the
purpose of this Mickey?

381
00:28:27,533 --> 00:28:29,179
I was following somebody.

382
00:28:29,850 --> 00:28:31,394
And when you woke up,

383
00:28:31,523 --> 00:28:32,550
he was gone.

384
00:28:32,730 --> 00:28:34,008
And now he's dead.

385
00:28:34,032 --> 00:28:35,861
- N.J. Gotlieb.
- The same.

386
00:28:36,131 --> 00:28:38,365
I'm going out to look
at his car, and...

387
00:28:40,166 --> 00:28:41,365
I was...

388
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:43,964
hoping that maybe
you might go with me.

389
00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:46,118
Are you asking me for help?

390
00:28:46,993 --> 00:28:50,459
Well, I'm asking you to
watch my back for ravens.

391
00:28:50,858 --> 00:28:51,920
Okay?

392
00:28:53,566 --> 00:28:55,477
I have to make a phone call.

393
00:28:59,533 --> 00:29:01,806
So! What are we looking for?

394
00:29:02,632 --> 00:29:03,786
I don't know.

395
00:29:03,979 --> 00:29:05,952
There's sand on
the drivers side.

396
00:29:06,139 --> 00:29:07,692
And none on the passengers.

397
00:29:08,812 --> 00:29:10,654
He went to the beach alone?

398
00:29:10,678 --> 00:29:13,072
Or he went with someone who
didn't come back with him.

399
00:29:14,565 --> 00:29:16,756
Is this what you do
when you detect?

400
00:29:16,879 --> 00:29:18,078
Yeah, basically.

401
00:29:18,478 --> 00:29:21,279
Well, it doesn't seem
very precise to me.

402
00:29:21,451 --> 00:29:23,713
What's buzzin', cousins?

403
00:29:25,592 --> 00:29:27,966
What is this, a field trip?

404
00:29:28,409 --> 00:29:31,969
I had to have somebody watching
my back while I was watching yours.

405
00:29:31,993 --> 00:29:34,752
Besides, Trudy might
be able to help.

406
00:29:35,022 --> 00:29:36,639
God knows I'm willing.

407
00:29:36,962 --> 00:29:38,348
What kinda help?

408
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:45,001
Events cling to objects, and Trudy is
very good at 'hearing' their memories.

409
00:29:45,104 --> 00:29:46,942
Very, very good.

410
00:29:49,293 --> 00:29:51,314
You want to know what
happened to Gotlieb,

411
00:29:51,339 --> 00:29:53,446
where he and his friend went?

412
00:29:55,433 --> 00:29:56,728
I don't use magic.

413
00:29:56,786 --> 00:29:57,872
Purist!

414
00:29:58,466 --> 00:30:00,347
Who said boo about magic?

415
00:30:00,492 --> 00:30:01,854
You drive the car.

416
00:30:01,991 --> 00:30:03,719
I read the map. That's all.

417
00:30:06,166 --> 00:30:08,448
And what are you, the chaperone?

418
00:30:12,373 --> 00:30:13,706
What about my car?

419
00:30:13,731 --> 00:30:15,806
We have to take this car.

420
00:30:15,938 --> 00:30:17,586
This holds the memories.

421
00:30:18,499 --> 00:30:20,345
It'll be our little secret.

422
00:30:23,552 --> 00:30:25,214
I get the front seat!

423
00:30:35,675 --> 00:30:36,755
Thanks.

424
00:31:06,449 --> 00:31:07,749
Here's where I lost them.

425
00:31:15,012 --> 00:31:17,387
It was raining when
they got back in the car.

426
00:31:18,286 --> 00:31:20,711
Gotlieb, and...

427
00:31:21,593 --> 00:31:22,984
another man.

428
00:31:24,825 --> 00:31:26,714
What am I, the chauffeur?

429
00:31:26,869 --> 00:31:29,962
Never mind. Keep Driving. You're
gonna have the time of your life.

430
00:31:31,313 --> 00:31:32,620
They drove down the hill.

431
00:31:34,270 --> 00:31:35,432
Where do I go?

432
00:31:36,016 --> 00:31:39,124
West on Sunset, all
the way to the beach.

433
00:31:46,386 --> 00:31:48,293
This is where they came.

434
00:32:05,806 --> 00:32:07,208
Now, you can wait here.

435
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:08,822
You forget, we can help.

436
00:32:08,972 --> 00:32:10,820
I found the house, didn't I?

437
00:32:11,399 --> 00:32:13,574
You want me to tell
you who owns it?

438
00:32:20,298 --> 00:32:21,324
Yes.

439
00:32:21,493 --> 00:32:22,897
I can almost feel it.

440
00:32:23,486 --> 00:32:24,766
It's definitely coming.

441
00:32:25,572 --> 00:32:26,992
Well, when it hits you

442
00:32:27,319 --> 00:32:28,755
would you let me know.

443
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:40,060
Want me to do that for you?

444
00:32:40,474 --> 00:32:41,540
Do you mind?

445
00:32:48,695 --> 00:32:49,788
All right.

446
00:33:13,239 --> 00:33:14,733
I don't understand.

447
00:33:14,979 --> 00:33:15,985
What?

448
00:33:16,165 --> 00:33:17,372
There's nothing.

449
00:33:19,245 --> 00:33:20,598
Nothing unusual?

450
00:33:20,732 --> 00:33:21,989
Nothing at all.

451
00:33:26,668 --> 00:33:29,632
This place has been
wiped clean, erased, its...

452
00:33:31,085 --> 00:33:32,628
I've never...

453
00:33:33,606 --> 00:33:35,737
It's so empty. What
happened here?

454
00:33:36,866 --> 00:33:39,237
- There was a girl.
- How do you know that?

455
00:33:39,845 --> 00:33:42,165
Doesn't take magic,
there's always a girl.

456
00:33:42,580 --> 00:33:44,748
Trudy, let's take a
look at the bedroom.

457
00:33:46,886 --> 00:33:48,266
Can I ask you something?

458
00:33:48,690 --> 00:33:49,695
No.

459
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:52,100
What exactly is your
problem with magic?

460
00:33:52,432 --> 00:33:54,198
I don't have a problem.

461
00:33:54,326 --> 00:33:56,063
- I just don't use it.
- Why?

462
00:33:57,261 --> 00:33:58,914
I've got personal reasons.

463
00:33:59,053 --> 00:34:00,243
It's a pity.

464
00:34:00,906 --> 00:34:03,614
Kropotkin says you have
the qualities of a Magus.

465
00:34:04,025 --> 00:34:05,038
To know.

466
00:34:05,278 --> 00:34:06,279
To dare.

467
00:34:06,304 --> 00:34:07,377
To will.

468
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:09,258
What?

469
00:34:09,639 --> 00:34:13,078
Somebody wiped the prints off the bottle
like they wiped the house of memories.

470
00:34:13,719 --> 00:34:15,812
So you wouldn't know
anyone was here.

471
00:34:15,837 --> 00:34:18,452
The easy thing would have been
to take the bottle and ditch it.

472
00:34:18,477 --> 00:34:19,695
Unless...

473
00:34:19,911 --> 00:34:20,920
Unless?

474
00:34:21,866 --> 00:34:22,979
Unless...

475
00:34:23,146 --> 00:34:25,385
Unless you wanted to make a show

476
00:34:25,719 --> 00:34:28,326
of wiping the prints because...

477
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:31,738
you want someone know
what you were doing

478
00:34:31,973 --> 00:34:33,549
Why would they do that?

479
00:34:33,846 --> 00:34:35,949
You're the one that
writes screenplays.

480
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:38,209
You tell me.

481
00:34:40,575 --> 00:34:42,800
Beverly Wilshire
Hotel, good morning.

482
00:34:43,066 --> 00:34:44,513
Room 1209.

483
00:34:44,766 --> 00:34:46,479
I'm sorry, those
calls are being held.

484
00:34:46,504 --> 00:34:48,786
Would you like to leave a
message for Senator Crockett?

485
00:34:49,066 --> 00:34:50,846
Oh, no, that's okay, thanks.

486
00:34:51,399 --> 00:34:52,532
What was that?

487
00:34:54,946 --> 00:34:56,339
Nobody's slept here.

488
00:34:56,713 --> 00:34:57,991
Look at that bed.

489
00:34:59,386 --> 00:35:00,890
There's not a ruffle on it.

490
00:35:01,566 --> 00:35:02,959
It's perfectly smooth.

491
00:35:03,853 --> 00:35:04,961
More show.

492
00:35:08,118 --> 00:35:09,237
Trudy,

493
00:35:09,261 --> 00:35:11,151
it's all right.

494
00:35:11,328 --> 00:35:12,828
No, it's not, it's
not all right!

495
00:35:12,853 --> 00:35:14,614
There's nothing here. Nothing!

496
00:35:15,666 --> 00:35:17,601
Somebody sucked the
life out of this place.

497
00:35:17,625 --> 00:35:19,326
It's so empty it
makes my head hurt.

498
00:35:19,619 --> 00:35:21,799
It's all right, kid.
You did your best.

499
00:35:22,471 --> 00:35:23,834
You don't understand.

500
00:35:24,074 --> 00:35:26,462
This place is dead,
as dead as the moon.

501
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:28,201
That's not right at all.

502
00:35:39,155 --> 00:35:41,303
Two rules you learn
in this business.

503
00:35:41,501 --> 00:35:42,808
Get paid up front

504
00:35:42,953 --> 00:35:44,975
and don't work with partners.

505
00:35:51,928 --> 00:35:54,221
The bathroom wasn't
empty after all.

506
00:35:55,672 --> 00:35:59,547
Someone had left a stem of
a martini glass from the bar.

507
00:36:00,765 --> 00:36:02,072
More show?

508
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:06,809
It took us three hours to
get home from Malibu.

509
00:36:07,025 --> 00:36:10,008
Then Trudy made us stop
to listen to a building.

510
00:36:33,132 --> 00:36:34,339
Jesus!

511
00:36:36,939 --> 00:36:39,025
You see that? You
see what he done?

512
00:36:39,050 --> 00:36:40,092
Frisk him.

513
00:36:53,012 --> 00:36:54,039
Move.

514
00:36:54,306 --> 00:36:55,322
Where?

515
00:36:55,585 --> 00:36:57,536
You're interested in
that house, aren't you?

516
00:37:12,333 --> 00:37:13,399
In.

517
00:37:16,119 --> 00:37:17,209
And sit.

518
00:37:18,506 --> 00:37:19,513
Thanks.

519
00:37:20,113 --> 00:37:21,713
- He polite.
- Shut up.

520
00:37:23,825 --> 00:37:24,899
Watch him.

521
00:37:26,099 --> 00:37:27,338
By which, I mean...

522
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:29,612
- Watch him!
- I'll watch him.

523
00:37:35,799 --> 00:37:38,430
Still using zombies. I
thought that went out.

524
00:37:39,866 --> 00:37:41,190
I just work here.

525
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:45,946
Don't they start to smell?

526
00:37:46,146 --> 00:37:48,733
Not for three months,
depending on the weather.

527
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:51,966
You coulda put out my eye
with that cigarette gag.

528
00:37:52,511 --> 00:37:53,526
Yeah.

529
00:37:55,786 --> 00:37:58,274
You think burning somebody's
face is a joke, huh, sailor?

530
00:37:58,299 --> 00:37:59,849
No, that's not a joke.

531
00:38:00,073 --> 00:38:02,313
Two cannibals are
eating a clown.

532
00:38:02,745 --> 00:38:04,119
One says

533
00:38:04,632 --> 00:38:06,299
does that taste funny to you?

534
00:38:06,966 --> 00:38:09,266
Now that-that-that's a joke.

535
00:38:14,094 --> 00:38:15,301
Stand up, sailor.

536
00:38:16,199 --> 00:38:18,341
Let's see how funny
it is with your face.

537
00:38:18,498 --> 00:38:19,699
What's your name. kid?

538
00:38:20,292 --> 00:38:21,297
Tyrone.

539
00:38:21,322 --> 00:38:22,522
Tyrone.

540
00:38:22,801 --> 00:38:25,045
You're not the sharpest
pencil in the box, are you?

541
00:38:58,982 --> 00:39:00,382
Once in a lifetime...

542
00:39:06,643 --> 00:39:09,823
If it ain't on the page,
it ain't on the stage.

543
00:39:13,266 --> 00:39:15,329
What do I care about television.

544
00:39:15,354 --> 00:39:17,655
If he's so hot for the
rights, let him have 'em.

545
00:39:21,512 --> 00:39:24,634

Mr. Brown, I'd like

560
00:40:59,739 --> 00:41:01,092
Good evening, sir.

561
00:41:02,666 --> 00:41:04,012
Perhaps a bit more

562
00:41:04,426 --> 00:41:05,732
sophistication.

563
00:41:06,595 --> 00:41:07,975
Of course.

564
00:41:32,259 --> 00:41:34,733
And a little more up top.

565
00:41:51,779 --> 00:41:53,834
Now you two run along.

566
00:42:15,585 --> 00:42:16,693
Hello.

567
00:42:16,895 --> 00:42:19,947
My name is Vivian Dart.
Welcome to my home.

568
00:42:20,104 --> 00:42:22,672
Are you looking for
anything particular tonight?

569
00:42:23,059 --> 00:42:25,551
Oh, I'm way past
being particular.

570
00:42:25,869 --> 00:42:27,869
Then I've got exactly
what you want.

571
00:42:28,070 --> 00:42:29,276
Right this way.

572
00:42:48,432 --> 00:42:50,408
I don't believe I
caught the name.

573
00:42:54,859 --> 00:42:56,605
Better nails today.

574
00:42:56,853 --> 00:42:58,639
You're a manicurist?

575
00:43:32,412 --> 00:43:34,114
Small world, isn't it?

576
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:40,391
You're getting too
old for this, Phil.

577
00:43:40,741 --> 00:43:42,054
Where's my wallet?

578
00:43:42,078 --> 00:43:43,654
You're leaving so soon?

579
00:43:43,679 --> 00:43:46,501
You and me have got such
a lot of catching up to do.

580
00:43:50,933 --> 00:43:53,008
He shouldn't be up here at all.

581
00:43:53,293 --> 00:43:55,799
Vivian, will you treat the man
with a little more respect?

582
00:43:55,903 --> 00:43:58,877
Phil and me are members of
the same noble profession.

583
00:44:01,275 --> 00:44:03,054
What are you doing here, Macha?

584
00:44:03,078 --> 00:44:04,290
Now, I've told ya,

585
00:44:04,314 --> 00:44:06,635
I'm a private
security consultant.

586
00:44:06,919 --> 00:44:10,978
I help Miss Dart make sure the
place runs nice and smooth.

587
00:44:11,953 --> 00:44:13,786
You're a bouncer
in a whore house?

588
00:44:13,811 --> 00:44:16,773
Cut the reunion, and
get him out of here.

589
00:44:19,808 --> 00:44:22,787
I think you upset her with
that whorehouse crack.

590
00:44:26,472 --> 00:44:27,958
Were you working for Dart,

591
00:44:28,633 --> 00:44:30,984
or Gotlieb, when he brought
the Senator up here?

592
00:44:32,493 --> 00:44:35,615
I'm not sure I know what
you're talking about, Phil.

593
00:44:36,395 --> 00:44:38,877
How come I don't
trust you, Macha?

594
00:44:38,901 --> 00:44:41,955
You don't trust yourself, how
do you trust anybody else?

595
00:44:43,166 --> 00:44:47,075
If you ever get tired of crawling around
in the bushes, Phillip, let me know.

596
00:44:47,099 --> 00:44:49,838
Always room for a man like
you in my organization.

597
00:44:49,993 --> 00:44:51,413
Here's your wallet.

598
00:44:51,786 --> 00:44:53,082
Who's got my gun?

599
00:44:53,106 --> 00:44:55,660
I'll keep it. You'll come
around, just you see.

600
00:44:55,972 --> 00:44:57,835
Well, you seem pretty sure.

601
00:44:58,246 --> 00:45:02,148
Ever wondered why it's the guy, not
the girl, that's nervous on prom night?

602
00:45:02,485 --> 00:45:05,540
That's because the girl knows
how it's going to come out.

603
00:45:05,571 --> 00:45:07,978
And that's the way it is
between you and me, Phillip.

604
00:45:08,051 --> 00:45:11,333
I'm the girl, I know how
it's going to come out.

605
00:45:12,172 --> 00:45:15,188
Call ahead next time, Vivian
will let you in the front door.

606
00:45:16,637 --> 00:45:19,251
What happened out at the
beach house, Macha?

607
00:45:19,999 --> 00:45:22,595
Which beach house
would that be, Phillip?

608
00:45:23,565 --> 00:45:25,035
You know the one.

609
00:45:25,706 --> 00:45:28,077
The one without
any fingerprints.

610
00:45:39,106 --> 00:45:42,153
Kim left the house,
in her pink car,

611
00:45:42,499 --> 00:45:45,253
with a pink dress,
and a purse to match.

612
00:45:46,213 --> 00:45:48,432
The lady knew how
to accessorize.

613
00:45:48,595 --> 00:45:51,279
I guess it was something
they taught you at the studio.

614
00:45:52,972 --> 00:45:57,186
I followed her out the new freeway,
past Rosemead, to El Monte.

615
00:45:57,612 --> 00:45:59,850
It was a long drive
to see a movie.

616
00:46:43,695 --> 00:46:46,831
Well, you have an interesting
way of mourning, Mrs. Gotlieb.

617
00:46:46,915 --> 00:46:48,722
I like to watch my pictures.

618
00:46:49,653 --> 00:46:50,733
You could

619
00:46:50,972 --> 00:46:52,553
run them in the screening room.

620
00:46:52,831 --> 00:46:54,424
I like to watch them

621
00:46:55,156 --> 00:46:56,156
big.

622
00:46:58,100 --> 00:47:00,082
No problem if I
just sit here and

623
00:47:00,213 --> 00:47:01,468
watch the show with you?

624
00:47:01,525 --> 00:47:04,006
Well, what can I do
about it, call an usher?

625
00:47:07,091 --> 00:47:08,117
Which

626
00:47:08,519 --> 00:47:09,527
picture you in?

627
00:47:10,267 --> 00:47:11,327
This one.

628
00:47:14,674 --> 00:47:16,074
You know, that big house

629
00:47:16,745 --> 00:47:19,653
on Glendower your husband
went to the night before he died?

630
00:47:20,515 --> 00:47:22,168
It's a high priced cat house.

631
00:47:22,192 --> 00:47:24,212
I told you to forget
about that house.

632
00:47:24,236 --> 00:47:27,134
He went there with a certain
gentleman, they picked up a girl,

633
00:47:27,706 --> 00:47:29,527
drove to a house
down at the beach,

634
00:47:29,900 --> 00:47:31,894
made sure I couldn't follow,

635
00:47:32,086 --> 00:47:34,019
after he left, something,

636
00:47:34,715 --> 00:47:35,775
somebody,

637
00:47:36,531 --> 00:47:38,984
made a big show of covering up.

638
00:47:40,043 --> 00:47:42,277
Now, what do you
suppose that might be?

639
00:47:43,163 --> 00:47:45,443
I told you once, I
don't know anything.

640
00:47:45,528 --> 00:47:48,259
You don't know it all.
You know something.

641
00:47:48,708 --> 00:47:50,261
You're part of this.

642
00:47:50,299 --> 00:47:52,220
I'm coming up in
this part, right here.

643
00:47:53,582 --> 00:47:57,515
I've kept that stupid pilot on the payroll
for years, just for a spot like this.

644
00:47:58,338 --> 00:47:59,771
Why doesn't he come?

645
00:48:03,830 --> 00:48:05,304
Don't try that again.

646
00:48:09,938 --> 00:48:11,365
I want to be seen.

647
00:48:11,573 --> 00:48:13,105
I want to be seen.

648
00:48:16,753 --> 00:48:18,473
You're very good in this.

649
00:48:31,740 --> 00:48:35,502
Jesus, Kim, I was going crazy.
I couldn’t find your car, and...

650
00:48:35,642 --> 00:48:36,828
Popcorn?

651
00:48:37,419 --> 00:48:39,048
It's okay, get in the car.

652
00:48:42,247 --> 00:48:44,628
This is nice and cozy, huh?

653
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:46,140
Who is this guy?

654
00:48:46,468 --> 00:48:48,349
I work for her. Who are you?

655
00:48:49,292 --> 00:48:51,432
She's a friend, and that's
all you have to know.

656
00:48:51,457 --> 00:48:52,986
Well, what's your name, friend?

657
00:48:53,011 --> 00:48:53,894
Marie.

658
00:48:53,918 --> 00:48:56,106
Marie! What a nice name.

659
00:48:57,198 --> 00:48:58,318
So, ah...

660
00:48:59,346 --> 00:49:00,758
tell me something, Marie,

661
00:49:01,500 --> 00:49:03,016
get out to the beach much?

662
00:49:03,261 --> 00:49:04,616
Shit!

663
00:49:04,826 --> 00:49:06,045
Easy.

664
00:49:19,345 --> 00:49:21,116
You can't get away,
drop the gun.

665
00:49:21,140 --> 00:49:22,364
Come and get it.

666
00:49:25,278 --> 00:49:26,659
- Stay down.
- He's shooting at us.

667
00:49:26,684 --> 00:49:29,705
Get out the car.
Slowly, slowly, stay down.

668
00:49:32,026 --> 00:49:33,959
Get ready. Okay, let's go.

669
00:49:45,220 --> 00:49:47,081
That's six. He's out of bullets.

670
00:49:47,679 --> 00:49:49,368
That was close.

671
00:49:50,358 --> 00:49:51,660
She's taking your car!

672
00:49:51,684 --> 00:49:52,698
Marie!

673
00:49:52,959 --> 00:49:54,064
Hey!

674
00:50:13,579 --> 00:50:14,759
Have a seat.

675
00:50:18,433 --> 00:50:19,800
Who you calling?

676
00:50:20,566 --> 00:50:22,599
I'm reporting a stolen car.

677
00:50:23,066 --> 00:50:24,347
The police?

678
00:50:24,591 --> 00:50:26,867
You're calling the police?
You can't do that.

679
00:50:27,157 --> 00:50:28,171
Why not?

680
00:50:28,700 --> 00:50:30,218
The car's not stolen.

681
00:50:31,056 --> 00:50:32,308
Not really.

682
00:50:32,748 --> 00:50:34,505
She just borrowed the car.

683
00:50:34,575 --> 00:50:36,355
And just who is she?

684
00:50:37,659 --> 00:50:38,901
A friend.

685
00:50:39,624 --> 00:50:40,541
Well,

686
00:50:40,566 --> 00:50:42,500
acquaintance,
more than a friend.

687
00:50:44,868 --> 00:50:47,900
And what does your
acquaintance, do for a living?

688
00:50:48,361 --> 00:50:49,555
I don't know.

689
00:50:51,049 --> 00:50:54,441
I mean, what difference does
it make where she works.

690
00:50:57,112 --> 00:50:58,853
You wanna know what I figure?

691
00:50:59,733 --> 00:51:01,867
I figure she works
for Vivian Dart.

692
00:51:01,891 --> 00:51:05,276
She's one of those girls from
that big house on Glendower.

693
00:51:05,740 --> 00:51:10,348
I figure she's the girl that your husband
dropped at the beach house with Crockett.

694
00:51:10,957 --> 00:51:13,997
Now, if that's so, why
is she so worried?

695
00:51:14,413 --> 00:51:17,691
And how come she came
running to you, of all people?

696
00:51:27,759 --> 00:51:30,497
You know somebody by
the name of Finn Mocha?

697
00:51:31,639 --> 00:51:33,074
Who's Finn Mocha?

698
00:51:33,506 --> 00:51:36,183
He was doing some consulting
work for your husband

699
00:51:36,208 --> 00:51:38,715
at the same time he was
working for Vivian Dart.

700
00:51:42,185 --> 00:51:43,488
I don't know him.

701
00:51:44,112 --> 00:51:47,422
Well, you don't know much of
anything, do you, Mrs. Gotlieb?

702
00:51:47,447 --> 00:51:48,563
Oh!

703
00:51:48,700 --> 00:51:50,819
I'm not the worst
person you ever met.

704
00:51:50,844 --> 00:51:52,452
Oh, I didn't say that.

705
00:51:53,472 --> 00:51:54,715
Fact is...

706
00:51:56,199 --> 00:51:57,493
I kind of like you.

707
00:51:59,226 --> 00:52:00,777
Most of the men I meet, well...

708
00:52:03,139 --> 00:52:05,366
You can pretty much
see right through them.

709
00:52:07,712 --> 00:52:08,880
You're different.

710
00:52:11,465 --> 00:52:12,532
Solid.

711
00:52:13,319 --> 00:52:15,109
In a mature sort of way.

712
00:52:16,111 --> 00:52:17,189
Yeah.

713
00:52:17,700 --> 00:52:19,941
There's too many
unanswered questions

714
00:52:19,966 --> 00:52:23,946
for you and me to start having
that particular conversation.

715
00:52:24,920 --> 00:52:26,105
Who says?

716
00:52:27,819 --> 00:52:28,920
I say.

717
00:52:37,728 --> 00:52:38,789
Yeah.

718
00:52:40,559 --> 00:52:41,642
Oh, yeah.

719
00:52:42,839 --> 00:52:44,168
Oh, I'm interested!

720
00:52:48,809 --> 00:52:50,889
Stay, here!

721
00:52:51,285 --> 00:52:52,422
Where you going?

722
00:52:54,146 --> 00:52:58,859
Oh, I don't answer your questions,
until you start answering mine.

723
00:53:14,866 --> 00:53:17,819
A few hours earlier she'd
been watching a movie,

724
00:53:18,226 --> 00:53:19,693
now she was a stiff.

725
00:53:20,833 --> 00:53:23,742
No matter how many times
I saw it, it always got to me.

726
00:53:24,319 --> 00:53:27,924
You know the story, girl
falls in with wrong crowd.

727
00:53:28,505 --> 00:53:30,977
One minute she's
a fresh faced gal,

728
00:53:31,302 --> 00:53:34,262
and the next, she's stuck
in the window of Saks.

729
00:53:49,713 --> 00:53:50,873
Bradbury.

730
00:53:51,798 --> 00:53:53,730
A couple of kids saw
her drive off the pier,

731
00:53:53,754 --> 00:53:55,800
and managed to get the
license number before it sank,

732
00:53:55,825 --> 00:53:57,368
I thought you might
be interested.

733
00:53:57,714 --> 00:53:58,989
Take a look inside.

734
00:53:59,074 --> 00:54:00,541
Foot's still on the accelerator.

735
00:54:00,806 --> 00:54:02,205
Look at her face!

736
00:54:02,519 --> 00:54:04,305
Suicides don't look like that.

737
00:54:04,498 --> 00:54:08,105
She didn't know she was driving off a
pier. Somebody put the whammy on her.

738
00:54:09,171 --> 00:54:11,598
She probably thought she
was at the Rose Parade!

739
00:54:12,393 --> 00:54:13,511
Who is she, Phil?

740
00:54:13,826 --> 00:54:16,508
It's your client's car, but that
ain't your client. Who is she?

741
00:54:16,571 --> 00:54:19,076
She lent the car to a friend.
I don't know her name.

742
00:54:35,163 --> 00:54:36,209
Come here.

743
00:54:37,864 --> 00:54:40,804
You wouldn't happen to know where
your client was this evening, would you?

744
00:54:40,828 --> 00:54:42,911
- I got a pretty good idea.
- Good.

745
00:54:43,035 --> 00:54:45,361
She hasn't been home since
she took this wagon out.

746
00:54:46,112 --> 00:54:47,794
Suppose I wanted to talk to her.

747
00:54:48,299 --> 00:54:50,528
You wouldn't get all coy all
of a sudden, would you?

748
00:54:50,993 --> 00:54:55,079
It's a free country, Bradbury. I mean, you
can talk to anybody that you want to.

749
00:54:55,752 --> 00:54:57,917
This Kim Hudson's a pretty
good-looking woman, if you

750
00:54:57,942 --> 00:54:59,895
go in for that movie
star sort of a thing.

751
00:55:00,148 --> 00:55:01,288
Uh-huh.

752
00:55:01,454 --> 00:55:05,052
And she's gotten herself involved
in two homicides in three days.

753
00:55:05,108 --> 00:55:06,864
Are you getting near the point?

754
00:55:07,632 --> 00:55:08,663
Just this...

755
00:55:09,912 --> 00:55:11,480
Don't get complicated, Phil.

756
00:55:12,326 --> 00:55:14,893
A man gets too complicated,
he starts to make mistakes.

757
00:55:15,632 --> 00:55:16,994
I'll keep that in mind.

758
00:55:18,224 --> 00:55:19,251
Good!

759
00:55:37,626 --> 00:55:38,899
She's gone.

760
00:55:43,986 --> 00:55:45,886
Your actress friend.

761
00:55:47,935 --> 00:55:49,661
The lady has secrets.

762
00:55:50,301 --> 00:55:52,048
Everybody has secrets.

763
00:55:54,812 --> 00:55:56,110
Drink your coffee.

764
00:55:58,046 --> 00:56:00,262
Everywhere I go in
this case is water.

765
00:56:02,033 --> 00:56:03,035
Rain.

766
00:56:03,059 --> 00:56:04,122
The ocean.

767
00:56:04,146 --> 00:56:05,460
Swimming pools.

768
00:56:06,145 --> 00:56:08,393
Water is very potent.

769
00:56:09,166 --> 00:56:10,672
Water makes me nervous.

770
00:56:19,466 --> 00:56:21,142
What kind of donuts are these?

771
00:56:22,112 --> 00:56:23,865
Two jellies and a bear claw.

772
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:27,697
- I'll take the bear claw.
- I want the bear claw.

773
00:56:28,633 --> 00:56:31,017
Then why did you
get the jelly donuts?

774
00:56:32,512 --> 00:56:34,485
Half the bear claw, all right?

775
00:56:37,646 --> 00:56:39,325
The raven is still with you,

776
00:56:39,846 --> 00:56:41,131
at your shoulder.

777
00:56:41,526 --> 00:56:43,715
I can't see it, but
I know it's there.

778
00:56:47,066 --> 00:56:48,906
The question is,
who's raven is it?

779
00:56:49,733 --> 00:56:51,074
Oh, it's yours.

780
00:56:51,098 --> 00:56:53,065
The raven belongs to you,

781
00:56:53,391 --> 00:56:56,117
as does the snake it
carries in it's beak.

782
00:56:57,213 --> 00:56:58,962
I didn't tell you
about the snake.

783
00:56:59,552 --> 00:57:00,586
No.

784
00:57:01,013 --> 00:57:02,185
You did not.

785
00:57:06,646 --> 00:57:08,814
We're looking for
Hypolyta Kropotkin.

786
00:57:09,752 --> 00:57:11,714
You've found Hypolyta Kropotkin.

787
00:57:12,188 --> 00:57:14,334
Hypolyta Kropotkin, I'm
here to serve you with

788
00:57:14,359 --> 00:57:16,574
this summons to appear
at the special senate

789
00:57:16,599 --> 00:57:20,817
subcommittee on unnatural activities,
as chaired by Senator Larson Crockett.

790
00:57:21,253 --> 00:57:22,413
Duly served.

791
00:57:24,232 --> 00:57:25,519
What's the big idea?

792
00:57:26,192 --> 00:57:27,426
Are you Lovecraft?

793
00:57:28,026 --> 00:57:29,295
Yeah, I'm Lovecraft!

794
00:57:30,112 --> 00:57:31,684
The senator would
like to meet you.

795
00:57:44,172 --> 00:57:48,565
I made my way up to the Pilgrimage Theater,
where Crockett was preparing his rallying.

796
00:57:49,425 --> 00:57:52,592
It's where the hold the Boy
Scout Jamboree every year.

797
00:57:53,176 --> 00:57:55,232
Crockett must have
felt right at home.

798
00:57:55,370 --> 00:57:58,283
He didn't drink, he didn't
smoke, he didn't lust.

799
00:57:58,442 --> 00:58:00,936
I couldn't figure out what
he wanted from me.

800
00:58:08,612 --> 00:58:11,332
Larson Crockett.
Pleased to meet you.

801
00:58:11,906 --> 00:58:12,934
Phil Lovecraft.

802
00:58:12,958 --> 00:58:16,073
Heard a lot about you, Phil. Heard
a considerable lot about you.

803
00:58:16,098 --> 00:58:19,841
Hope you don't mind meeting out here,
got a lot to do and precious little time.

804
00:58:19,865 --> 00:58:22,257
Our support grows
bigger every day.

805
00:58:22,652 --> 00:58:25,100
That's a little
premature, isn't it?

806
00:58:25,633 --> 00:58:26,705
The stake?

807
00:58:27,065 --> 00:58:28,772
You might say it's symbolic.

808
00:58:29,358 --> 00:58:31,210
Nice centerpiece for the rally.

809
00:58:31,633 --> 00:58:34,631
Of course, now that congress has
passed the capital punishment bill,

810
00:58:35,433 --> 00:58:37,572
well, then, it could be
something else, couldn't it?

811
00:58:37,642 --> 00:58:39,912
Why did you subpoena Kropotkin?

812
00:58:42,033 --> 00:58:44,606
I take it you know she's
a card-carrying witch!

813
00:58:44,903 --> 00:58:47,856
Having an office across from
her, you probably see things,

814
00:58:48,056 --> 00:58:49,296
hear things,

815
00:58:49,886 --> 00:58:51,138
smell things.

816
00:58:51,163 --> 00:58:53,283
I'm smelling
something right now.

817
00:58:55,433 --> 00:58:57,725
I thought you were the man
who didn't believe in magic?

818
00:58:58,004 --> 00:58:59,152
Oh, I believe in it,

819
00:58:59,899 --> 00:59:01,385
I just don't use it.

820
00:59:05,666 --> 00:59:07,685
Oh, it's a gift from a friend.

821
00:59:09,059 --> 00:59:12,118
Friends are a valuable commodity,
Phil, but you gotta be  careful.

822
00:59:12,633 --> 00:59:14,999
Don't let people get too
close. Things rub off.

823
00:59:15,281 --> 00:59:18,534
A man has to very careful
of the company he keeps.

824
00:59:18,747 --> 00:59:20,475
You must get very lonely.

825
00:59:23,079 --> 00:59:25,486
Would you give a loaded
gun to a child, Lovecraft?

826
00:59:25,966 --> 00:59:28,119
Would you let a baby
play with a blowtorch?

827
00:59:28,659 --> 00:59:30,065
Of course you wouldn't!

828
00:59:30,699 --> 00:59:32,533
I love the people
of this country.

829
00:59:32,777 --> 00:59:34,912
I love them enough to
protect them from sinister

830
00:59:34,937 --> 00:59:37,204
forces, out to exploit
their appetites.

831
00:59:37,294 --> 00:59:39,494
I want you to join
my personal staff.

832
00:59:39,804 --> 00:59:42,813
Come on-board as a
full-time paid investigator.

833
00:59:42,837 --> 00:59:45,210
Together, we could bring
about an end to this plague!

834
00:59:45,872 --> 00:59:48,781
Well, I appreciate your
offer, but I got clients.

835
00:59:49,153 --> 00:59:50,401
The Gotlieb killing?

836
00:59:50,679 --> 00:59:52,648
There are better
uses for your talents.

837
00:59:54,033 --> 00:59:56,433
How many times did
you and Gotlieb meet?

838
00:59:59,299 --> 01:00:00,433
Just once.

839
01:00:04,879 --> 01:00:07,437
He came by my hotel.
He wanted to talk in private,

840
01:00:07,462 --> 01:00:09,275
so we drove around
for a few hours.

841
01:00:09,833 --> 01:00:12,008
He told me many
disturbing things about the

842
01:00:12,033 --> 01:00:14,481
influence of magic in the
motion picture business.

843
01:00:14,506 --> 01:00:17,799
I tried to get him to testify
for my committee, but

844
01:00:18,346 --> 01:00:19,546
he was too afraid,

845
01:00:19,899 --> 01:00:21,859
not unjustifiably
as it turned out.

846
01:00:22,050 --> 01:00:23,328
Well, that's too bad.

847
01:00:23,352 --> 01:00:25,850
Yes, Gotlieb would have
made a very powerful witness,

848
01:00:25,875 --> 01:00:28,750
but under the circumstances,
his wife will be just as effective.

849
01:00:29,199 --> 01:00:31,744
As Gotlieb's widow, she
felt it was her duty to

850
01:00:31,769 --> 01:00:34,412
uncover the forces of magic
corrupting the movies.

851
01:00:34,632 --> 01:00:38,315
She's testifying tomorrow morning,
just before your friend Kropotkin.

852
01:00:39,733 --> 01:00:41,449
Hudson's your client, isn't she?

853
01:00:43,166 --> 01:00:44,667
State your name for the record.

854
01:00:45,059 --> 01:00:46,320
My name is

855
01:00:46,513 --> 01:00:48,318
Mrs. N.J. Gotlieb.

856
01:00:50,312 --> 01:00:51,527
Be seated.

857
01:00:54,686 --> 01:00:58,952
You are the widow of motion picture
producer N.J. Gotlieb, is that correct?

858
01:00:59,278 --> 01:01:00,390
Yes, sir.

859
01:01:01,233 --> 01:01:04,152
Did your husband ever express
to you his concern about the

860
01:01:04,177 --> 01:01:07,516
pernicious influence of magic
in the motion picture business?

861
01:01:07,803 --> 01:01:10,797
Oh, yes, my husband,
my late husband,

862
01:01:11,280 --> 01:01:13,407
often confided in me his

863
01:01:13,740 --> 01:01:16,140
growing sense of apprehension.

864
01:01:16,358 --> 01:01:20,818
He felt the practitioners of magic
had an agenda that was outside

865
01:01:21,559 --> 01:01:24,932
the needs and desires
of ordinary America.

866
01:01:26,052 --> 01:01:29,691
You are testifying in your
husband's place this morning?

867
01:01:30,593 --> 01:01:32,226
That is correct, senator.

868
01:01:33,519 --> 01:01:34,588
Why is that?

869
01:01:35,698 --> 01:01:36,829
Nicky,

870
01:01:37,440 --> 01:01:38,816
my husband,

871
01:01:41,425 --> 01:01:43,556
can no longer speak for himself.

872
01:01:46,712 --> 01:01:47,759
He was...

873
01:01:49,820 --> 01:01:50,869
killed.

874
01:01:52,553 --> 01:01:54,115
Murdered by magic!

875
01:02:01,398 --> 01:02:02,732
The woman is good!

876
01:02:03,066 --> 01:02:05,866
Ah, she's gotta be good, she
doesn't have a contract anymore.

877
01:02:06,365 --> 01:02:07,545
Mrs. Gotlieb.

878
01:02:11,066 --> 01:02:13,493
Do you recognize the
item in this envelope?

879
01:02:14,326 --> 01:02:15,460
Excuse me?

880
01:02:16,119 --> 01:02:18,479
The item in this envelope,
do you recognize it?

881
01:02:21,333 --> 01:02:24,253
That's Nicky's watch chain,
how did you get this?

882
01:02:24,933 --> 01:02:26,628
To your knowledge, was

883
01:02:26,652 --> 01:02:29,726
this chain in your husband’s
possession at the time of his death?

884
01:02:31,746 --> 01:02:33,015
I guess so.

885
01:02:35,160 --> 01:02:38,913
That's an interesting piece of metal at
the fob, did you give him that charm?

886
01:02:40,026 --> 01:02:41,059
No.

887
01:02:42,332 --> 01:02:44,973
But you know who did give it to
him, don't you, Mrs. Gotlieb?

888
01:02:47,518 --> 01:02:49,326
I think it was someone
at the studio.

889
01:02:51,598 --> 01:02:53,278
What was that person's name?

890
01:02:58,987 --> 01:03:00,707
We're waiting, Mrs. Gotlieb?

891
01:03:01,732 --> 01:03:03,505
What was the name
of that person?

892
01:03:04,826 --> 01:03:05,952
Senator...

893
01:03:07,373 --> 01:03:08,385
I...

894
01:03:08,586 --> 01:03:11,065
think this is sort
of outside what...

895
01:03:12,779 --> 01:03:15,188
I expected we would
be talking about.

896
01:03:17,300 --> 01:03:20,093
The name, Mrs. Gotlieb,
give us the name.

897
01:03:27,760 --> 01:03:29,462
I believe her name...

898
01:03:30,412 --> 01:03:31,448
is...

899
01:03:31,979 --> 01:03:33,021
Kropotkin.

900
01:03:33,919 --> 01:03:35,252
Hypolyta Kropotkin.

901
01:03:35,519 --> 01:03:38,328
This Kropotkin woman,
is she a practitioner?

902
01:03:42,946 --> 01:03:44,788
I believe so... yes.

903
01:03:44,971 --> 01:03:47,414
- But senator, I'm sure...
- The witness may step down.

904
01:03:47,438 --> 01:03:49,724
- Thank you very much for your time.
- But senator.

905
01:03:50,217 --> 01:03:51,888
Call the next witness.

906
01:03:53,607 --> 01:03:57,079
Hypolyta Kropotkin, come
forward and be heard.

907
01:04:17,666 --> 01:04:19,135
State your name for the record.

908
01:04:20,908 --> 01:04:23,041
Hypolyta Lavoe Kropotkin.

909
01:04:23,295 --> 01:04:25,361
Hypolyta Lavoe Kropotkin,

910
01:04:25,394 --> 01:04:28,300
are you now, or have
you ever been, a witch?

911
01:04:29,238 --> 01:04:31,314
Ice, cloud, river...

912
01:04:32,393 --> 01:04:34,193
water is always water.

913
01:04:35,039 --> 01:04:37,553
Is that a yes, or a no?

914
01:04:38,393 --> 01:04:39,672
That is a yes.

915
01:04:47,613 --> 01:04:49,262
Is that you in the photographs?

916
01:04:50,129 --> 01:04:51,184
Yes, it is.

917
01:04:51,523 --> 01:04:53,110
Who are the other
people with you?

918
01:04:54,340 --> 01:04:55,688
-Those are my friends.
- Better get outta here.

919
01:04:55,712 --> 01:04:56,726
Just go, go, go.

920
01:04:56,752 --> 01:04:59,333
Are they not, in fact,
members of your coven?

921
01:04:59,586 --> 01:05:01,892
There is nothing
shameful in a coven.

922
01:05:02,846 --> 01:05:06,479
What are the circumstances of
your participation in this coven?

923
01:05:06,557 --> 01:05:10,849
When, where, who else was
there? What are their names?

924
01:05:11,795 --> 01:05:17,010
The names of people whose souls are
laced with magic, that is what you want?

925
01:05:18,005 --> 01:05:19,301
That is what we want.

926
01:05:21,586 --> 01:05:24,505
Then give me the phone
book and I'll start with the A's.

927
01:05:24,682 --> 01:05:27,875
Magic is in every one of
us, it's as common as salt.

928
01:05:28,550 --> 01:05:33,436
What you want to do is to prevent
people from finding it and nurture it.

929
01:05:34,835 --> 01:05:36,479
Don't think you're
the first practitioner

930
01:05:36,504 --> 01:05:38,959
who's tried to excuse
their behavior with this

931
01:05:39,009 --> 01:05:42,231
cloudy reference
to natural magic.

932
01:05:43,144 --> 01:05:45,064
Now, I'll give you
one more chance

933
01:05:45,196 --> 01:05:47,284
to identify the other
members of your coven.

934
01:05:49,339 --> 01:05:50,953
I decline to do so,

935
01:05:52,313 --> 01:05:53,346
respectfully.

936
01:05:55,386 --> 01:05:58,088
Mrs. Kropotkin, do you recognize
the item in this envelope?

937
01:05:59,626 --> 01:06:01,068
It is familiar to me.

938
01:06:02,166 --> 01:06:04,522
Did you give this
item to N.J. Gotlieb?

939
01:06:06,220 --> 01:06:07,248
Yes.

940
01:06:07,733 --> 01:06:09,145
Let the record show

941
01:06:09,169 --> 01:06:13,071
that the unfortunate Mr. Gotlieb,
had this item, in his possession

942
01:06:13,095 --> 01:06:15,733
when he was diminished
by supernatural means.

943
01:06:16,480 --> 01:06:19,394
Did you do anything to this
stone before you gave it to him?

944
01:06:20,712 --> 01:06:22,337
There is an incantation

945
01:06:23,533 --> 01:06:24,543
for peace

946
01:06:25,080 --> 01:06:26,099
and wisdom

947
01:06:26,485 --> 01:06:28,491
and resolve in purpose.

948
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:31,523
You cast a spell on the stone.
Is that what you're saying?

949
01:06:31,810 --> 01:06:33,008
A benevolent one.

950
01:06:33,033 --> 01:06:34,764
A benevolent one!

951
01:06:34,952 --> 01:06:39,643
I have here the laboratory report
from the FBI on this particular stone.

952
01:06:39,667 --> 01:06:42,328
It concludes that there are
measurable levels of the most

953
01:06:42,353 --> 01:06:45,587
pernicious and toxic magic
they have ever encountered.

954
01:06:45,667 --> 01:06:48,967
More than enough to do what was
done to the unwitting Mr. Gotlieb.

955
01:06:51,259 --> 01:06:53,120
What are you
suggesting, senator?

956
01:06:53,299 --> 01:06:57,400
I am suggesting, my good
woman, that you are a witch,

957
01:06:57,912 --> 01:06:59,385
and a practitioner.

958
01:07:00,206 --> 01:07:03,519
That you gave this tainted item
to an innocent man, about

959
01:07:03,544 --> 01:07:07,084
to reveal your sinister cabal,
and that man is now dead!

960
01:07:08,565 --> 01:07:11,220
Hypolyta Kropotkin, we
have evidence of how

961
01:07:11,245 --> 01:07:14,027
you used your shameless
and unwholesome powers.

962
01:07:14,051 --> 01:07:15,976
I give you this opportunity

963
01:07:16,001 --> 01:07:17,909
to recant your belief in magic,

964
01:07:17,933 --> 01:07:20,967
renounce all supernatural
agents and activities,

965
01:07:20,992 --> 01:07:23,261
and purge yourself
of all affiliations

966
01:07:23,285 --> 01:07:25,210
with other witches, conjurers,

967
01:07:25,235 --> 01:07:27,413
- and similar practitioners.
- I recant nothing.

968
01:07:27,483 --> 01:07:31,186
I renounce no one.
And I need no purging!

969
01:07:31,423 --> 01:07:33,043
You leave me no alternative.

970
01:07:34,506 --> 01:07:36,430
Hypolyta Lavoe Kropotkin,

971
01:07:37,079 --> 01:07:39,762
the Congress of the United
States of America hereby

972
01:07:39,787 --> 01:07:42,692
brands you a murderer,
and consort of the devil.

973
01:07:42,716 --> 01:07:46,402
In keeping with the emergency
powers of the Unnatural Activity Act,

974
01:07:46,429 --> 01:07:48,950
I order you to be taken
to a public place,

975
01:07:48,974 --> 01:07:52,363
where you will be burned as
punishment for your crimes

976
01:07:52,387 --> 01:07:54,496
and for the enlightenment
of the general population.

977
01:07:55,072 --> 01:07:57,812
- Sgt. at arms, take her into custody.
- It's not right.

978
01:07:59,166 --> 01:08:00,471
Motion to adjourn.

979
01:08:00,831 --> 01:08:02,677
- Kropotkin!
- Lovecraft.

980
01:08:14,649 --> 01:08:15,662
Crockett!

981
01:08:17,265 --> 01:08:19,055
Hard ball, Mr. Lovecraft.

982
01:08:40,001 --> 01:08:41,068
Kim?

983
01:09:04,366 --> 01:09:06,769
You want to tell me why
you got in the pool?

984
01:09:10,012 --> 01:09:11,188
Crockett set me up.

985
01:09:13,020 --> 01:09:15,255
He said I'd be cleared and
everything would just go

986
01:09:15,280 --> 01:09:18,188
away if I made a little speech
about the evils of magic.

987
01:09:20,506 --> 01:09:24,652
I didn't know he was going to ask me
about the watch fob, or Kropotkin.

988
01:09:27,127 --> 01:09:28,511
I honestly didn't know.

989
01:09:30,512 --> 01:09:32,300
Now they're gonna burn her.

990
01:09:35,012 --> 01:09:36,521
I thought it was
the way to fix it.

991
01:09:37,045 --> 01:09:38,455
Oh, it's fixed all right.

992
01:09:39,833 --> 01:09:42,688
Did they tell you that your
friend Marie is dead?

993
01:09:43,593 --> 01:09:44,599
What?

994
01:09:45,306 --> 01:09:47,880
They fished her out
of the bay in your car.

995
01:09:49,559 --> 01:09:51,532
No, I didn't know.

996
01:09:54,266 --> 01:09:55,323
Who was she?

997
01:09:57,425 --> 01:09:59,230
She worked for Vivian Dart.

998
01:10:01,540 --> 01:10:04,341
Marie's the girl Nicky brought to
the beach house for Crockett.

999
01:10:06,012 --> 01:10:08,132
What's your
connection with Dart?

1000
01:10:11,346 --> 01:10:13,203
She did some work for me once.

1001
01:10:14,120 --> 01:10:15,349
What kind of work?

1002
01:10:33,106 --> 01:10:36,687
I worked in the steno pool
of that studio for six years,

1003
01:10:37,312 --> 01:10:38,986
saving every penny.

1004
01:10:40,399 --> 01:10:42,492
I went from typing scripts,

1005
01:10:43,033 --> 01:10:45,151
to being a star, overnight.

1006
01:10:46,230 --> 01:10:47,405
Vivian...

1007
01:10:49,097 --> 01:10:50,657
Dart, did the ah...

1008
01:10:50,933 --> 01:10:51,978
enchanting?

1009
01:10:52,002 --> 01:10:55,357
She gave me, whatever it
is, that movie stars have.

1010
01:10:55,599 --> 01:10:57,257
That thing we all want.

1011
01:10:58,557 --> 01:10:59,637
I got it!

1012
01:11:02,097 --> 01:11:04,350
Nobody at the studio
recognized you?

1013
01:11:06,433 --> 01:11:09,762
No one at the studio even
looked at me before the spell.

1014
01:11:10,099 --> 01:11:11,625
Gotleib didn't know?

1015
01:11:12,019 --> 01:11:13,065
Nobody knew.

1016
01:11:14,166 --> 01:11:15,476
Except Dart, and

1017
01:11:15,992 --> 01:11:18,112
that Irishman that
works for her.

1018
01:11:19,099 --> 01:11:20,145
Macha.

1019
01:11:20,505 --> 01:11:22,105
I had to pay him off regular.

1020
01:11:23,744 --> 01:11:24,752
I bet.

1021
01:11:27,372 --> 01:11:29,219
You met Marie...

1022
01:11:29,349 --> 01:11:30,477
at Darts?

1023
01:11:32,759 --> 01:11:35,588
She worked with Macha
and Dart on special dates.

1024
01:11:37,924 --> 01:11:39,504
And she does what?

1025
01:11:39,832 --> 01:11:40,857
Well,

1026
01:11:41,278 --> 01:11:43,212
when they wanted
to set someone up,

1027
01:11:43,501 --> 01:11:45,607
they let the sex
get a little rough.

1028
01:11:46,333 --> 01:11:50,181
Then Marie hits her head
or slips in the bathtub,

1029
01:11:51,178 --> 01:11:52,208
and drowns.

1030
01:11:52,813 --> 01:11:53,841
Macha shows up,

1031
01:11:54,633 --> 01:11:57,541
says everything can be
taken care of for a price.

1032
01:11:58,092 --> 01:11:59,578
The patsy pays, leaves.

1033
01:12:00,757 --> 01:12:03,130
Marie's free to
play another day.

1034
01:12:06,166 --> 01:12:08,506
So that's what happened
at the beach house.

1035
01:12:09,253 --> 01:12:11,026
They're shaking
down the senator,

1036
01:12:11,685 --> 01:12:13,098
Something goes wrong.

1037
01:12:24,858 --> 01:12:26,399
Presto change-o.

1038
01:12:27,512 --> 01:12:29,281
What's wrong with
having what you want?

1039
01:12:33,126 --> 01:12:34,619
I just wanted to be happy.

1040
01:12:35,418 --> 01:12:36,932
They got pills for that now.

1041
01:12:38,638 --> 01:12:39,802
Phew! Water!

1042
01:12:40,992 --> 01:12:42,182
Water everywhere.

1043
01:12:44,259 --> 01:12:45,826
You don't know everything.

1044
01:12:47,059 --> 01:12:48,865
You don't have the
magic in your blood.

1045
01:12:49,466 --> 01:12:51,899
You don't have it on your
skin every day of your life.

1046
01:12:53,279 --> 01:12:54,299
No,

1047
01:12:54,966 --> 01:12:57,966
but I used to once, a
long time ago, just once.

1048
01:13:00,633 --> 01:13:01,658
There were two men,

1049
01:13:02,333 --> 01:13:05,153
they're going out on a boat and
I needed to hear what they said.

1050
01:13:06,666 --> 01:13:08,750
So I hid an empty
bottle on board,

1051
01:13:10,033 --> 01:13:11,638
and when they came back,

1052
01:13:12,798 --> 01:13:14,028
I took the bottle,

1053
01:13:15,900 --> 01:13:17,880
and I poured the
conversation out,

1054
01:13:19,200 --> 01:13:20,650
and I had what I needed.

1055
01:13:21,633 --> 01:13:24,414
But they weren't alone on
the boat, there was a girl.

1056
01:13:25,086 --> 01:13:26,786
So when the cops came after 'em,

1057
01:13:27,245 --> 01:13:28,978
they figured the
girl had ratted.

1058
01:13:29,405 --> 01:13:30,558
Cops got 'em both,

1059
01:13:30,852 --> 01:13:32,318
but before they did,

1060
01:13:32,552 --> 01:13:33,585
one of 'em

1061
01:13:34,333 --> 01:13:35,376
had time

1062
01:13:36,015 --> 01:13:37,942
to take her back
out on that boat

1063
01:13:39,379 --> 01:13:40,676
strangle her,

1064
01:13:42,299 --> 01:13:44,317
and throw her body in the bay.

1065
01:13:48,519 --> 01:13:49,565
Am now,

1066
01:13:52,873 --> 01:13:54,225
the man and the bottle

1067
01:13:56,179 --> 01:13:57,461
has come back.

1068
01:14:09,259 --> 01:14:10,882
Busy, busy, busy.

1069
01:14:11,632 --> 01:14:13,566
Rush, rush, rush!

1070
01:14:15,045 --> 01:14:16,404
How'd you get up here?

1071
01:14:17,665 --> 01:14:20,359
You forget, somebody
showed me the back way.

1072
01:14:22,139 --> 01:14:23,452
Where's Mocha?

1073
01:14:26,118 --> 01:14:27,591
Was it your idea

1074
01:14:27,757 --> 01:14:30,008
or Mocha's, to set up Crockett
in the badger game?

1075
01:14:30,033 --> 01:14:31,111
I know it wasn't Gotlieb,

1076
01:14:31,136 --> 01:14:33,257
all he wanted to do was
show him a good time.

1077
01:14:33,596 --> 01:14:35,428
I don't know what
you're talking about.

1078
01:14:35,822 --> 01:14:37,288
I'm not interested in you.

1079
01:14:38,012 --> 01:14:39,147
Finn Mocha!

1080
01:14:39,710 --> 01:14:41,952
Oh, he's something
else again, isn't he?

1081
01:14:42,240 --> 01:14:45,139
I'm done with Macha, that
partnership is dissolved.

1082
01:14:45,164 --> 01:14:47,824
I'm taking a long,
long, vacation.

1083
01:14:48,939 --> 01:14:49,972
Where is he?

1084
01:14:56,127 --> 01:14:57,220
He's leaving.

1085
01:14:58,272 --> 01:14:59,640
I'm a lucky man.

1086
01:14:59,878 --> 01:15:03,156
I don't suppose you need any help
with your luggage, do you, Vivian?

1087
01:15:03,912 --> 01:15:04,916
Guess not.

1088
01:15:14,499 --> 01:15:16,365
Watch the noise, fellas.

1089
01:15:20,526 --> 01:15:22,213
You know what they
say about zombies?

1090
01:15:22,238 --> 01:15:23,061
What?

1091
01:15:23,086 --> 01:15:24,300
Strong as hell,

1092
01:15:24,826 --> 01:15:27,524
but very bad lateral movement.

1093
01:16:05,746 --> 01:16:06,746
Mint?

1094
01:16:21,413 --> 01:16:24,020
Let's try it one more
time. Where's Mocha?

1095
01:16:35,297 --> 01:16:36,804
Get your flags!

1096
01:16:57,440 --> 01:16:59,606
Evening, Lovecraft,
glad you could make it.

1097
01:17:00,279 --> 01:17:01,390
How much is in there?

1098
01:17:01,878 --> 01:17:05,396
Oh, not so much in the
grand scheme of things.

1099
01:17:05,839 --> 01:17:07,710
Expediting pays pretty good.

1100
01:17:07,970 --> 01:17:09,430
So does discretion.

1101
01:17:09,912 --> 01:17:13,259
You had Gotlieb killed. You thought he
was the one working the badger game.

1102
01:17:13,766 --> 01:17:15,819
I'm afraid I went off
a little half-cocked.

1103
01:17:15,980 --> 01:17:17,113
And the girl.

1104
01:17:17,203 --> 01:17:18,319
Loose ends, Phil.

1105
01:17:18,343 --> 01:17:20,429
You know how I am
about loose ends.

1106
01:17:22,166 --> 01:17:24,372
And, whose idea was it to

1107
01:17:24,485 --> 01:17:25,726
set up Kropotkin?

1108
01:17:25,938 --> 01:17:26,939
Mine.

1109
01:17:27,336 --> 01:17:30,313
The senator wanted to use
Kim, but I convinced him that

1110
01:17:30,337 --> 01:17:33,513
the frame would be a
better fit using the witch.

1111
01:17:33,731 --> 01:17:35,899
So,

1112
01:17:35,900 --> 01:17:37,493
this guy's

1113
01:17:38,033 --> 01:17:39,466
gonna blackmail you

1114
01:17:40,300 --> 01:17:42,720
and now you're acting
like long lost brothers.

1115
01:17:43,566 --> 01:17:46,425
Politics makes strange
bedfellows, I guess.

1116
01:17:46,503 --> 01:17:48,149
But he's a practitioner!

1117
01:17:50,572 --> 01:17:51,602
So?

1118
01:17:52,679 --> 01:17:54,092
It was all a show.

1119
01:17:59,018 --> 01:18:01,317
The hearings, the
press coverage.

1120
01:18:02,100 --> 01:18:05,886
Attacking magic. You could care
less about protecting the people.

1121
01:18:07,900 --> 01:18:12,166
Spend some time in congress, Phil.
You get up-to-here with the people.

1122
01:18:13,206 --> 01:18:15,579
Listening to their
petty complaints,

1123
01:18:15,604 --> 01:18:18,693
their demands, their
constant inane whining

1124
01:18:18,718 --> 01:18:22,265
about one thing after the next thing,
after the next thing, after the next thing!

1125
01:18:22,388 --> 01:18:25,366
Just because they vote for you,
they think you owe them something!

1126
01:18:25,632 --> 01:18:27,873
But why go after magic?

1127
01:18:29,519 --> 01:18:31,215
Who am I supposed to go after?

1128
01:18:31,665 --> 01:18:32,945
Big business?

1129
01:18:33,325 --> 01:18:36,218
You need something a little
different, a little outside.

1130
01:18:37,178 --> 01:18:40,061
Let me tell you something
about the people, Phil.

1131
01:18:40,933 --> 01:18:43,001
You lock any ten
of 'em in a room,

1132
01:18:43,566 --> 01:18:45,072
they may not elect a leader,

1133
01:18:45,473 --> 01:18:48,433
but I guarantee they'll
pick someone to hate.

1134
01:18:53,591 --> 01:18:56,464
Burn the witch,
burn the witch...

1135
01:18:56,728 --> 01:18:58,591
Back up! Back up!

1136
01:19:02,396 --> 01:19:03,996
Stay back!

1137
01:19:04,671 --> 01:19:06,051
Come on! Back off!

1138
01:19:06,828 --> 01:19:07,994
Stay back!

1139
01:19:13,019 --> 01:19:15,019
I'm not gonna let you burn her.

1140
01:19:15,158 --> 01:19:18,866
The witch will burn, and there's
nothing you can do about it.

1141
01:19:19,364 --> 01:19:21,344
You'd be surprised
what I can do.

1142
01:19:21,437 --> 01:19:22,484
Really?

1143
01:19:23,412 --> 01:19:24,570
Gentleman.

1144
01:19:26,165 --> 01:19:27,886
Did you hear everything?

1145
01:19:28,097 --> 01:19:29,165
Yes, sir.

1146
01:19:30,060 --> 01:19:32,185
What was the gist of
our conversation?

1147
01:19:32,772 --> 01:19:35,985
They brought money in that satchel,
they thought they could pay you off.

1148
01:19:38,099 --> 01:19:39,281
Well then,

1149
01:19:40,133 --> 01:19:41,369
you'd better arrest them.

1150
01:19:41,394 --> 01:19:43,207
What are you trying
to pull, Crockett?

1151
01:19:44,266 --> 01:19:45,879
I'd better take
that for evidence.

1152
01:19:46,766 --> 01:19:49,312
No one double
crosses Finn Macha!

1153
01:19:49,395 --> 01:19:51,216
I'm the one that sees inside.

1154
01:19:51,466 --> 01:19:53,905
If you don't believe
me, ask Lovecraft.

1155
01:19:54,592 --> 01:19:57,992
I see what's inside,
and I bring it out!

1156
01:19:58,276 --> 01:20:00,692
What you are is an
insignificant little Mick.

1157
01:20:02,945 --> 01:20:05,933
The crack of Solomon
on your heart.

1158
01:20:13,959 --> 01:20:15,099
Bring them both.

1159
01:20:15,364 --> 01:20:16,986
I don't want them
to miss the show.

1160
01:20:18,772 --> 01:20:20,492
What did you just do?

1161
01:21:45,839 --> 01:21:47,741
Someone just remarked...

1162
01:21:47,765 --> 01:21:51,733
This could make a great movie.
Wil, work on something, will ya?

1163
01:21:51,757 --> 01:21:55,512
Well, I think we have
something just as special.

1164
01:21:55,536 --> 01:22:00,869
Ladies and gentlemen, the next president
of the United States, Larson Crockett!

1165
01:22:12,477 --> 01:22:13,824
America,

1166
01:22:14,644 --> 01:22:16,377
is going to be...

1167
01:22:16,802 --> 01:22:17,956
all right!

1168
01:22:21,058 --> 01:22:24,584
And it's going to be all right
because of people like you!

1169
01:22:26,653 --> 01:22:27,695
God...

1170
01:22:29,988 --> 01:22:32,230
God, I love this country.

1171
01:22:39,286 --> 01:22:41,341
The fire we light tonight

1172
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:43,886
will burn across America.

1173
01:22:44,179 --> 01:22:45,992
It will set fires

1174
01:22:46,533 --> 01:22:48,019
in every city

1175
01:22:49,232 --> 01:22:50,645
and every town.

1176
01:22:52,071 --> 01:22:53,625
Can I count on you?

1177
01:22:59,159 --> 01:23:00,699
Can I depend on you?

1178
01:23:02,715 --> 01:23:04,668
Of course I can!

1179
01:23:33,303 --> 01:23:35,104
We know the difference

1180
01:23:37,536 --> 01:23:41,429
- Between right and wrong.
- No one double-crosses Finn Macha.

1181
01:23:41,654 --> 01:23:42,767
And we know

1182
01:23:44,264 --> 01:23:45,324
our cause...

1183
01:23:53,588 --> 01:23:55,388
The cameras, the cameras!

1184
01:23:55,413 --> 01:23:57,684
The cameras? Off, now!

1185
01:24:38,939 --> 01:24:41,400
That feels good!

1186
01:24:41,719 --> 01:24:44,234
Nothing like a little fresh air!

1187
01:24:45,899 --> 01:24:47,745
Looks like we're
having a little party!

1188
01:24:48,220 --> 01:24:50,272
Well, guess who just showed up?

1189
01:24:51,573 --> 01:24:52,602
Hey!

1190
01:24:53,260 --> 01:24:54,955
What the fuck you lookin' at?

1191
01:24:56,865 --> 01:24:57,929
Come on!

1192
01:24:58,246 --> 01:24:59,836
Time to burn the witch.

1193
01:25:00,396 --> 01:25:02,534
Come on, we're gonna burn her,

1194
01:25:02,559 --> 01:25:05,715
then we're gonna burn another one, and
another one, and another one after that.

1195
01:25:05,744 --> 01:25:08,137
We're gonna stack
'em up like firewood!

1196
01:25:08,597 --> 01:25:10,282
Come on, what's wrong
with you people?

1197
01:25:10,421 --> 01:25:12,742
You're pretty loud when
you want something!

1198
01:25:14,964 --> 01:25:17,111
Oh, Senator Crockett,

1199
01:25:17,209 --> 01:25:19,218
I-I deserve better.

1200
01:25:19,242 --> 01:25:22,629
Oh, Senator Crockett,
I deserve a better life!

1201
01:25:22,702 --> 01:25:27,948
Oh, Senator Crockett, I deserve TV
dinners, and T-birds, and lawns to cut!

1202
01:25:27,973 --> 01:25:29,304
And peace of mind.

1203
01:25:29,328 --> 01:25:32,299
Well, I got news for all of
you, you're not gonna get it!

1204
01:25:32,324 --> 01:25:34,178
I'll tell you what
you're gonna get,

1205
01:25:34,203 --> 01:25:39,043
porno video, and double-digit
inflation, and a designated hitter.

1206
01:25:39,089 --> 01:25:42,175
And wars in countries
you never even heard of!

1207
01:25:42,653 --> 01:25:45,826
Now that's what I call
a world without magic!

1208
01:25:46,030 --> 01:25:47,099
Hey!

1209
01:25:47,380 --> 01:25:48,880
Where you all going?!

1210
01:25:49,393 --> 01:25:51,259
The party just started.

1211
01:25:51,613 --> 01:25:53,886
I thought you wanted
me to help you out!

1212
01:25:54,665 --> 01:25:56,945
I thought you liked me!

1213
01:25:59,363 --> 01:26:00,750
Ah, fuck it!

1214
01:26:01,128 --> 01:26:03,121
I'll do it myself.

1215
01:26:05,388 --> 01:26:06,854
Go on, arrest him!

1216
01:26:06,879 --> 01:26:08,354
Arrest both of them.

1217
01:26:08,379 --> 01:26:10,635
Your names? I want
both your names!

1218
01:26:12,417 --> 01:26:13,830
Let go, you!

1219
01:26:14,969 --> 01:26:16,797
I have friends in high places!

1220
01:26:18,415 --> 01:26:19,589
Come on.

1221
01:26:27,139 --> 01:26:28,359
Where's Macha?

1222
01:26:28,458 --> 01:26:30,906
I don't know. He took off when
Crockett came out of his shell.

1223
01:26:30,931 --> 01:26:33,271
I gotta find him. We've got
some unfinished business.

1224
01:26:43,545 --> 01:26:46,233
It seems he feels
the same way too.

1225
01:27:22,566 --> 01:27:23,701
You stay here.

1226
01:27:23,725 --> 01:27:25,239
You shouldn't do this alone.

1227
01:27:25,851 --> 01:27:27,066
Yes, I should.

1228
01:27:27,882 --> 01:27:31,118
Some people use magic
for gain or revenge,

1229
01:27:31,142 --> 01:27:34,143
But Macha... Macha
uses it out of malice.

1230
01:27:34,168 --> 01:27:37,948
It's not just his eye
that's sour, it's his soul.

1231
01:27:38,938 --> 01:27:41,735
Then I guess you better
keep the motor running.

1232
01:28:04,075 --> 01:28:07,608
Lovely of you to come, Phillip,
and at such short notice.

1233
01:28:30,006 --> 01:28:32,600
So how'd things work out
with Senator Crockett?

1234
01:28:33,966 --> 01:28:35,640
They're trying to
put him together.

1235
01:28:36,086 --> 01:28:38,880
No one double-crosses
Finn Macha.

1236
01:28:40,546 --> 01:28:42,562
Too bad you left before the end.

1237
01:28:43,566 --> 01:28:45,422
But that wasn't
the end, Phillip.

1238
01:28:46,247 --> 01:28:48,427
This is it, right here.

1239
01:28:49,700 --> 01:28:50,780
Where is she?

1240
01:28:51,960 --> 01:28:53,153
Where's Kim?

1241
01:28:56,432 --> 01:28:58,931
I haven't forgotten that
business with the bottle.

1242
01:28:59,817 --> 01:29:00,992
I figure,

1243
01:29:01,016 --> 01:29:02,950
once a man uses magic,

1244
01:29:03,566 --> 01:29:04,877
he may use it again.

1245
01:29:05,412 --> 01:29:07,812
And I want that man on my team.

1246
01:29:09,242 --> 01:29:10,752
I don't use magic.

1247
01:29:11,326 --> 01:29:12,605
We'll see.

1248
01:29:13,148 --> 01:29:14,509
I ask you a question.

1249
01:29:14,533 --> 01:29:16,361
Well, where do you
think she might be?

1250
01:29:18,246 --> 01:29:20,360
I'm a fan of old movies.

1251
01:29:20,926 --> 01:29:23,887
I like to watch them
over, and over.

1252
01:29:24,646 --> 01:29:26,677
And there's one I'd
like to show you.

1253
01:29:28,553 --> 01:29:30,601
Except, it's not that old.

1254
01:29:31,971 --> 01:29:33,641
Just a couple of days.

1255
01:29:34,932 --> 01:29:36,271
Come along, Phillip.

1256
01:29:37,145 --> 01:29:38,867
Here's my screening room.

1257
01:29:45,840 --> 01:29:47,468
And this is my movie.

1258
01:29:49,959 --> 01:29:53,149
- Call me Mr. President again.
- Mr. President.

1259
01:29:59,846 --> 01:30:01,060
Take a seat.

1260
01:30:06,566 --> 01:30:10,203
A wonderful thing about old
movies is you get to recast them.

1261
01:30:10,519 --> 01:30:13,471
Take this one for instance,
it wasn't cast right.

1262
01:30:21,699 --> 01:30:23,335
That's much better.

1263
01:30:27,933 --> 01:30:29,675
I've also done a little rewrite.

1264
01:30:29,699 --> 01:30:31,452
In the original,
the girl didn't die,

1265
01:30:31,477 --> 01:30:34,139
but considering the
new cast, she will.

1266
01:30:36,566 --> 01:30:38,255
Well, aren't you
going to do anything?

1267
01:30:40,200 --> 01:30:41,724
Think of the little lady.

1268
01:30:49,138 --> 01:30:50,308
Let her go.

1269
01:30:50,485 --> 01:30:51,844
Well, you could make me.

1270
01:30:52,179 --> 01:30:54,787
You could whip up some
of the Mojo Hoodoo.

1271
01:30:54,899 --> 01:30:57,397
Conjure up a lightning
bolt and strike me down.

1272
01:30:57,421 --> 01:30:58,982
You want some incentive?

1273
01:31:01,672 --> 01:31:02,799
No!

1274
01:31:04,172 --> 01:31:05,782
You have the power!

1275
01:31:06,037 --> 01:31:08,521
You know the words!
You know the spells!

1276
01:31:08,685 --> 01:31:11,540
You let one girl die
because you used magic.

1277
01:31:11,564 --> 01:31:14,079
Are you going to let another
one die because you won't!

1278
01:31:14,445 --> 01:31:16,527
Work for me, Phil.

1279
01:31:22,100 --> 01:31:25,200
Darling, you're about
to die of principles.

1280
01:31:28,812 --> 01:31:30,865
I don't use magic.

1281
01:31:30,995 --> 01:31:32,738
Well, the pity is,

1282
01:31:33,035 --> 01:31:34,244
I do.

1283
01:31:36,933 --> 01:31:38,118
Help me.

1284
01:32:14,433 --> 01:32:17,141
Water, water, everywhere.

1285
01:32:43,302 --> 01:32:46,109
I'm sorry, Phil, I
couldn't let you do it.

1286
01:32:47,246 --> 01:32:48,969
I flipped the bird.

1287
01:32:57,172 --> 01:32:58,719
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

1288
01:33:00,252 --> 01:33:02,205
You sure this is what
you want to do?

1289
01:33:02,912 --> 01:33:04,118
Pretty sure.

1290
01:33:04,712 --> 01:33:07,312
Well, the public's gonna wonder
what happened to Kim Hudson.

1291
01:33:07,438 --> 01:33:09,572
Well, if they want
to wonder, let 'em.

1292
01:33:14,820 --> 01:33:16,623
Well, thanks.

1293
01:33:17,142 --> 01:33:18,286
Good luck.

1294
01:33:19,959 --> 01:33:20,972
Bye.

1295
01:33:24,039 --> 01:33:25,166
Wait a second.

1296
01:33:28,225 --> 01:33:29,655
There's something we forgot.

1297
01:33:29,795 --> 01:33:30,815
What?

1298
01:33:55,393 --> 01:33:56,490
Wow!

1299
01:33:57,020 --> 01:33:59,539
A girl could last the
winter on a kiss like that.

1300
01:34:08,547 --> 01:34:09,967
Don't forget to write.

1301
01:34:11,101 --> 01:34:12,541
Oh, I won't.

1302
01:34:24,806 --> 01:34:26,567
Kim Hudson disappeared.

1303
01:34:27,383 --> 01:34:29,650
But since she never
really existed,

1304
01:34:29,959 --> 01:34:31,823
I figured the score was even.

1305
01:34:32,929 --> 01:34:34,570
It didn't matter anyway,

1306
01:34:34,594 --> 01:34:38,040
pretty soon another girl would
be stepping off the Highland bus,

1307
01:34:38,328 --> 01:34:41,934
wishing herself into a
D-cup, and her big break.

1308
01:34:42,419 --> 01:34:43,760
Crockett, too.

1309
01:34:43,973 --> 01:34:45,600
He's the kind of guy

1310
01:34:45,624 --> 01:34:47,613
who says he hates magic

1311
01:34:47,637 --> 01:34:51,364
and then goes home and
levitates chicks in the basement.

1312
01:34:51,844 --> 01:34:55,857
Last I heard, he was sharing a
cell with himself in San Quentin.

1313
01:34:57,599 --> 01:34:59,030
And so it goes.

1314
01:34:59,991 --> 01:35:03,940
There was usually a one-to-one ratio
between dreams and disappointments,

1315
01:35:03,965 --> 01:35:06,124
and no amount of magic
could change that.

1316
01:35:06,289 --> 01:35:09,378
It's always gonna be there if
someone wants to believe in it.

1317
01:35:10,192 --> 01:35:11,349
Let's face it,

1318
01:35:11,846 --> 01:35:13,811
everybody's gotta
believe in something.
