No, no! Please, I beg you!

00:01:18,591 --> 00:01:20,200
I beg you, tell them the truth!

4
00:01:20,650 --> 00:01:23,170
Tell them you know me, I'm not a witch!

5
00:01:23,270 --> 00:01:25,176
My daughter! No...

<i>CITY OF VILLACH

00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:31,885
Let me go, please!

8
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:34,700
No! No!

9
00:01:35,125 --> 00:01:38,605
No! Please! No!

10
00:01:40,282 --> 00:01:44,401
You all have been found guilty of
witchcraft and consulting with the devil.

11
00:01:44,501 --> 00:01:47,033
If you would
save your souls from perdition...

12
00:01:47,133 --> 00:01:50,192
...repent now and confess your sins

13
00:01:50,292 --> 00:01:53,443
I confess! I confess! I confess!

14
00:01:53,618 --> 00:01:56,000
Please, I beg you, have mercy on me!

15
00:01:56,190 --> 00:01:57,020
I made ointments for a couple.

16
00:01:57,100 --> 00:02:00,322
But it was just pig's fat not witchcraft,
I swear it!

17
00:02:00,723 --> 00:02:02,368
Priest...

18
00:02:03,128 --> 00:02:06,442
You gonna burn in hell.

19
00:02:08,483 --> 00:02:09,838
Do it.

20
00:02:12,458 --> 00:02:15,334
No! Please!

21
00:02:18,622 --> 00:02:22,077
Wait! Wait!
You said that you're would spare me.

22
00:02:22,177 --> 00:02:24,221
Your Soul, child.

23
00:02:24,321 --> 00:02:26,550
Your Soul will be spared.

24
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:29,660
But the body must be
consigned to God for absolution.

25
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:33,096
No! No! Please, I beg you! No...

26
00:02:58,464 --> 00:02:59,535
Wait!

27
00:03:00,183 --> 00:03:02,461
Thier bodies must be pulled up.

28
00:03:02,561 --> 00:03:05,305
There are words wich must be spoken,
from the book of Solomon.

29
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:07,503
To unsure they not rise again.

30
00:03:07,603 --> 00:03:11,527
They've been hanged and drowned.
That's dead enough for me.

31
00:04:14,624 --> 00:04:15,815
Amen.

Today you are truly blessed.

35
00:05:57,781 --> 00:06:01,923
Today, you fight for God himself.

36
00:06:02,023 --> 00:06:07,354
Today, yoy're holy warriors ,
baptized in the blood of our unholy enemies!

37
00:06:07,454 --> 00:06:09,807
Look to the rabble down there, Behmen.

38
00:06:09,907 --> 00:06:12,016
Just waiting to meet the Lord.

39
00:06:12,116 --> 00:06:16,328
I pity anyman whose last face
they see is yours, Felson.

40
00:06:16,973 --> 00:06:22,145
The only sin you will face
this day is Faliure.

41
00:06:22,245 --> 00:06:24,827
Whom ever slays most men drinks for free.

42
00:06:24,927 --> 00:06:28,221
I'll take the 300 left,
you take the 300 on the right.

43
00:06:28,321 --> 00:06:31,603
But If we divide them evenlly
who will buy tonigts drinks?

44
00:06:31,703 --> 00:06:36,085
- Oh, you're buying tonight man.
- Prepare your battle.

45
00:06:36,185 --> 00:06:38,917
Fine. I'll kill all 600 my self.

46
00:06:40,061 --> 00:06:43,969
Draw your arms!

47
00:06:49,311 --> 00:06:51,519
Charge!

48
00:07:39,747 --> 00:07:42,336
I have nothing
but a powerfull thirst baby.

49
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:45,221
You're buying, my friend.

They are godless people! Infidels!

60
00:09:21,187 --> 00:09:25,979
They sinned against God
and against his only son, Jesus Christ!

61
00:09:26,079 --> 00:09:28,572
They must be punished.

62
00:09:29,395 --> 00:09:35,137

- For God. Not for this.

68
00:10:56,074 --> 00:10:58,919
I am a herald of God in this world.

69
00:10:59,019 --> 00:11:02,774
- His voice rings ever in my ears.
- Perhaps it's not his voice you hear.

70
00:11:02,874 --> 00:11:06,038
How dare you?
I am the voice of the church!

71
00:11:06,138 --> 00:11:09,090
Bathed in truth and blameless
in light of the Lord.

You're no more than
a drop of blood on his hands!

Who contorls your insolent tougne,
Behmen?

00:11:24,866 --> 00:11:27,668
Let's get the hell out of here.

75

- All of them?

80
00:12:20,283 --> 00:12:24,153
We have been walking all day

81
00:12:24,253 --> 00:12:27,583
Keep your souls And only find a chicken.

82

Hello?

83
00:12:52,866 --> 00:12:55,044

Hello?

What happened to them?

86
00:13:46,498 --> 00:13:48,289
I don't know.

87

We have seen so much death you and I.

Some deserved, some not.

89
00:14:20,707 --> 00:14:23,768
But What is one do,
to deserve a death like that?

90
00:14:23,868 --> 00:14:25,362
Nothing.

91
00:14:37,806 --> 00:14:40,648
Finally a town!

92
00:14:40,748 --> 00:14:43,123
We might be recognized.

93
00:14:43,963 --> 00:14:47,666

00:15:02,045 --> 00:15:04,784

- What madness is this?
- Plague.

100
00:15:34,908 --> 00:15:36,640
Plague?

101
00:15:37,232 --> 00:15:39,217
Like no other

102
00:15:39,317 --> 00:15:42,006
the pestilence over all the land.

103
00:15:42,106 --> 00:15:44,397
- is there no cure?
- None.

104
00:15:44,497 --> 00:15:46,598
How long is it been so?

105
00:15:46,853 --> 00:15:49,572
three years in a season.

106
00:15:49,672 --> 00:15:53,563
- How many died?
- Some says as many in three and four.

107
00:15:55,385 --> 00:16:00,090
But with my own hands I have buried
two children and the wife who born them

108
00:16:01,291 --> 00:16:02,731
But, How is it you you don't know this?

109
00:16:03,003 --> 00:16:06,729
We're travellers
We have only recently returned

Thank you

113
00:16:25,165 --> 00:16:26,466
Leave it!

114
00:16:35,819 --> 00:16:37,825
Felson, this way

115
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:40,218
What is it now?

116
00:16:40,717 --> 00:16:43,262
They saw my sword's Crest

117
00:16:44,095 --> 00:16:46,714
I told we should've gone around

118
00:16:46,950 --> 00:16:50,010
You two! Stand fast!

119
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:51,494
Shit!

120
00:17:08,989 --> 00:17:11,015
Fine

121
00:17:11,403 --> 00:17:13,174
Come with me

122
00:17:15,277 --> 00:17:17,092
Drop it!

123
00:17:25,412 --> 00:17:28,221
Remove the hood and the mask

124
00:17:32,008 --> 00:17:34,262
Arrest these deserters

125
00:17:37,429 --> 00:17:38,879
Wait!

126
00:17:40,551 --> 00:17:42,515
Let me see that

127
00:17:48,959 --> 00:17:50,763
this is yours?

128
00:17:52,262 --> 00:17:54,099
Follow me

129
00:17:58,928 --> 00:18:01,829
I hope we are on our way to dinner

130
00:18:01,829 --> 00:18:03,319
What you want with us, Priest?

131
00:18:04,183 --> 00:18:07,220
that's not up for me to say

132
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:17,930
Pardon me, your eminent

133
00:18:18,114 --> 00:18:20,251
What is it, Debelzaq?

134
00:18:20,415 --> 00:18:23,863
This the knight's sword

135
00:18:23,863 --> 00:18:26,363
Come closer

136
00:18:42,163 --> 00:18:44,949
Tell me your name

137
00:18:44,949 --> 00:18:47,509
I am Behmen of Blybrook.

138
00:18:47,509 --> 00:18:50,675
Behmen, yes ...

139
00:18:50,675 --> 00:18:53,543
And your comrade, Felson.

140
00:18:53,543 --> 00:18:57,245
Your names are known to me

141
00:18:57,245 --> 00:19:01,299
Your victories have become legends

142
00:19:02,718 --> 00:19:09,851
Yes, I'm stricken...
The Plague is everywhere

143
00:19:09,851 --> 00:19:12,228
It's a curse called up from Hell

144
00:19:12,273 --> 00:19:15,026
Brought upon us by
The Black Witch

145
00:19:15,026 --> 00:19:17,330
The Black Witch ?!

146
00:19:17,998 --> 00:19:20,904
I myself heard the confession

147
00:19:20,904 --> 00:19:26,265
The Witch must be taken
the abbey of Severak

148
00:19:26,265 --> 00:19:31,990
Where the Monks possess the last
copy of an ancient book

149
00:19:31,990 --> 00:19:36,017
rituals that will destroy
the Witch's powers,

150
00:19:36,923 --> 00:19:41,844
And End the plague

151
00:19:41,844 --> 00:19:44,118
What is this to do with us?

152
00:19:44,118 --> 00:19:49,595
Our ranks have been decimated

153
00:19:49,595 --> 00:19:53,065
You must deliver her

154
00:19:53,065 --> 00:19:57,618
My best knight, Eckhart
has already pledged his services

155
00:19:57,662 --> 00:20:01,380
As has our priest Debelzaq

156
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:04,178
I ask the same of you

157
00:20:04,178 --> 00:20:08,802
Will you serve the church, once more?

158
00:20:08,802 --> 00:20:11,374
- I can not
- you swear in front of God

159
00:20:11,773 --> 00:20:15,640
- Have you been released from this vow ?
- My vow is to god

160
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:18,775
Not the men how murder in his name.

161
00:20:18,775 --> 00:20:21,151
You know the penalty for desertion

162
00:20:21,151 --> 00:20:25,696
I ask again
Behmen of Blybrook,

163
00:20:26,713 --> 00:20:31,635
Do you serve God and the church ?

164
00:20:31,635 --> 00:20:34,370
I serve the church no more

165
00:20:39,292 --> 00:20:40,451
In there

166
00:20:41,887 --> 00:20:43,486
Both of you

167
00:20:52,252 --> 00:20:55,451
What do they do with deserters any way?

168
00:20:55,688 --> 00:20:57,671
Hang them?

169
00:20:58,405 --> 00:21:00,515
Burn them ?

170
00:21:00,515 --> 00:21:02,812
Probably both

171
00:21:02,812 --> 00:21:03,921
I know

172
00:21:04,315 --> 00:21:09,645
If I the one who say on the matter
I prefer to hanging

173
00:21:37,902 --> 00:21:40,008
Is that the Witch ?!

174
00:21:40,259 --> 00:21:43,684
That It is not what I see

175
00:21:43,684 --> 00:21:46,126
The priest said she confessed.

176
00:21:46,126 --> 00:21:49,702
We both know the church
can be Most ... Persuasive

177
00:21:49,702 --> 00:21:51,431
ahh

178
00:21:51,431 --> 00:21:53,175
I am Sorry, I Put you into this Felson

179
00:21:53,306 --> 00:21:59,963
Ah, These dungeons go
and this one is not so bad

180
00:21:59,963 --> 00:22:03,061
We spent nights in much worse places than this

181
00:22:03,061 --> 00:22:04,957
At least I have

182
00:22:04,957 --> 00:22:07,684
What's that smell?

183
00:22:08,002 --> 00:22:10,593
That would be you

184
00:22:28,172 --> 00:22:31,441
"I serve the church No more"

185
00:22:34,283 --> 00:22:37,001
Did you see the priest face?

186
00:22:37,001 --> 00:22:41,249
He looked like someone pissed in his holy water

187
00:23:01,351 --> 00:23:04,030
They are godless people! Infidels

188
00:23:04,031 --> 00:23:08,757
They sinned against God
and against his only son, Jesus Christ!

189
00:23:09,007 --> 00:23:11,354
They must be punished

190
00:23:47,435 --> 00:23:48,708
You want to speak with the Cardinal?

191
00:23:49,409 --> 00:23:52,554
Tell him we will deliver
the girl to Severak, on one condition

192
00:23:52,554 --> 00:23:54,662
That she is given a fair trail

193
00:23:55,302 --> 00:23:59,317
- You cann't bargain with the church.
- This is not for your church.

194
00:24:00,784 --> 00:24:03,390
And we want our weapons returned

195
00:24:04,194 --> 00:24:08,101
And all charges dismissed

196
00:24:11,499 --> 00:24:15,020
We're here.
The abbey is is here

197
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:19,210
The distance is nearly 400 leagues
That's roughly Six days travel

198
00:24:19,210 --> 00:24:21,068
As you can see,
We charted a course.

199
00:24:21,068 --> 00:24:23,270
You would lead us through here?

200
00:24:24,386 --> 00:24:25,554
That is the most direct route, yes.

201
00:24:25,554 --> 00:24:27,334
Across the river, through ...

202
00:24:28,334 --> 00:24:31,668
300 Leagues of heavy forest,
and a mountain pass?

203
00:24:32,068 --> 00:24:34,095
This forest is called Wormwood

204
00:24:34,427 --> 00:24:36,200
It's not a place to be trifled with.

205
00:24:36,309 --> 00:24:38,978
Men have lost their way there,
and were never to be seen again.

206
00:24:39,283 --> 00:24:42,352
Tell me, Priest,
have you ever made a journey yourself?

207
00:24:43,544 --> 00:24:45,600
- No.
- Naturally.

208
00:24:47,751 --> 00:24:49,632
these are the best maps in the land.

209
00:24:50,032 --> 00:24:51,858
But, We will do better to have a guide.

210
00:24:51,858 --> 00:24:56,053
You know, Someone who has travelled
from here to there.

211
00:24:56,443 --> 00:24:59,092
A tax collector, perhaps a merchant?

212
00:25:01,685 --> 00:25:04,848
There is someone, but ...

213
00:25:07,928 --> 00:25:09,761
Ahhh , ...Visitors!

214
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:11,194
What can I do for you gentlemen?

215
00:25:11,385 --> 00:25:14,190
Perhaps, you would like to  help me with fruit,
or kick me in the groin

216
00:25:14,519 --> 00:25:16,860
You're Hagamar? The swindler?

217
00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:17,707
Yes.

218
00:25:18,007 --> 00:25:19,197
I... I mean no!

219
00:25:19,497 --> 00:25:21,789
I am Hagamar,
but I never swindled anyone.

220
00:25:22,055 --> 00:25:24,998
I sold relics. Genuine Relics

221
00:25:25,098 --> 00:25:27,041
Where did sell your trinkets?

222
00:25:27,141 --> 00:25:30,526
Everywhere.
I have happy customers from here to Prague.

223
00:25:32,249 --> 00:25:34,068
And in Severak?

224
00:25:34,168 --> 00:25:36,556
Yes.  The monks.

225
00:25:36,656 --> 00:25:39,948
I sold them the tail of an asteroid
and a flag from Egypt

226
00:25:40,048 --> 00:25:44,886
- Quite a barging ,I am sure
- Then you know the way to the abbey.

227
00:25:44,986 --> 00:25:46,635
Like the back of my hand.

228
00:25:46,735 --> 00:25:49,433
I'd happy to draw  you a map, only ...

229
00:25:49,828 --> 00:25:52,574
The bailiff has prepared to pardon you

230
00:25:52,674 --> 00:25:55,077
On one condition.

231
00:25:55,177 --> 00:25:57,701
You serve as our guide to Severak.

232
00:25:57,801 --> 00:25:59,565
Condition accepted.

233
00:26:00,459 --> 00:26:03,941
If I were to release you however,
and you attempt to flee ...

234
00:26:04,041 --> 00:26:05,762
Such thoughts are beneath you sir

235
00:26:05,862 --> 00:26:09,297
I swear by all the saints,
me they struck me dead , were I to lie.

236
00:26:10,113 --> 00:26:12,937
and you will have to get in line behind me.

237
00:26:13,511 --> 00:26:15,212
Do we understand each other?

238
00:26:22,528 --> 00:26:27,093
the Witch is unconscious.
she was given a powerful sedative in her food last night

239
00:26:27,193 --> 00:26:28,864
Open the cell.

240
00:26:29,970 --> 00:26:32,695
We will be removing the witch for transport.

241
00:26:45,591 --> 00:26:47,133
she's just a girl.

242
00:26:47,733 --> 00:26:49,562
Do be deceived.

243
00:27:03,354 --> 00:27:04,855
Felson!

244
00:27:05,874 --> 00:27:08,897
Hold her! Hold her!

245
00:27:09,753 --> 00:27:12,184
The sooner we get her to
Severak, the better.

246
00:27:15,794 --> 00:27:18,043
Now she is sedated

247
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:36,993
Who is that ?

248
00:27:37,093 --> 00:27:39,411
-The Witch.
- Witch?

249
00:27:39,511 --> 00:27:41,694
Nobody said anything about a witch.

250
00:27:41,794 --> 00:27:44,963
What did you think we are going to Severak,
to sell trinkets?

251
00:27:45,063 --> 00:27:46,700
Kill the witch!

252
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:49,363
You gave us this infection!

253
00:27:49,588 --> 00:27:53,356
you brought the wrath of good upon us!
take the witch out of our land

254
00:27:54,316 --> 00:27:56,016
And take the plague with you!

255
00:28:00,177 --> 00:28:01,583
Demon!

256
00:28:43,189 --> 00:28:44,821
She is watching me

257
00:28:45,257 --> 00:28:48,559
put your mind on something else.
She is trying to frighten you.

258
00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:50,687
It's working.

259
00:28:52,785 --> 00:28:55,470
How did you come upon this girl?

260
00:28:55,570 --> 00:28:58,032
She was found
just outside of Maburn , wandering ...

261
00:28:58,132 --> 00:29:02,194
Muttering strange things words,
no one can understand

262
00:29:02,506 --> 00:29:06,337
- This makes her a witch?
- No, but it's a sign.

263
00:29:06,437 --> 00:29:10,172
And with in the fourth night of her arrival,
Plague has swept over us.

264
00:29:10,272 --> 00:29:13,392
It was the same for every town she passed

265
00:29:13,492 --> 00:29:17,831
there no take of such a girl
passing through my village ...

266
00:29:17,931 --> 00:29:20,986
yet, the plague came

267
00:29:33,663 --> 00:29:36,247
She is stronger than she looks.

268
00:29:38,354 --> 00:29:40,802
Do you believe she is a witch?

269
00:29:40,902 --> 00:29:44,296
But you felt her strength
would You say, it was that of a girl?

270
00:29:44,396 --> 00:29:47,992
I have seen girls destroy men
without lifting a finger.

271
00:29:48,092 --> 00:29:52,741
How many times do we need to go over this?
We were in France! for god sake.

272
00:29:53,825 --> 00:29:56,535
And things she did in the bed chamber.

273
00:29:56,635 --> 00:30:00,524
- She robbed you out of the year's wages.
- Yes, but ...

274
00:30:00,833 --> 00:30:03,786
gave me so much in return.

275
00:30:06,384 --> 00:30:07,999
Look at us.

276
00:30:08,099 --> 00:30:10,786
Barely a month out of service to the church
and here we are !

277
00:30:10,886 --> 00:30:14,326
deserters, in the service of the church.

278
00:30:17,572 --> 00:30:19,890
You know we are being followed.

279
00:30:23,867 --> 00:30:26,647
Let's give him a royal welcome

280
00:30:45,693 --> 00:30:47,801
Come of the horse.

281
00:30:56,064 --> 00:30:58,944
Who are you? Why you're following us?

282
00:31:00,420 --> 00:31:02,671
I asked you a question boy.

283
00:31:03,918 --> 00:31:06,469
He's an altar boy
and services to the Cardinal.

284
00:31:06,569 --> 00:31:08,266
My name is Kay.

285
00:31:08,366 --> 00:31:11,658
My father was a knight. Yuran Wolenbar.

286
00:31:11,758 --> 00:31:15,171
He also fought in "Ambrose"
Perhaps you have heard his name.

287
00:31:17,017 --> 00:31:20,842
- What do you want?
- I want to come with you to Severak.

288
00:31:20,942 --> 00:31:22,769
Easy, boy.

289
00:31:23,490 --> 00:31:27,836
To pledge myself to your service

290
00:31:27,936 --> 00:31:32,354
in exchange, for which I ask your word
that you will vouch for me upon our return...

291
00:31:32,454 --> 00:31:34,919
So I may be knighted.

292
00:31:39,981 --> 00:31:44,252
The services of an altar boy
I feel safer already

293
00:31:44,352 --> 00:31:48,134
I would have you know, I have been written in the lists twice
and I won flags for valour.

294
00:31:48,234 --> 00:31:50,911
That's not a tournament, kid.
Go back to your mother.

295
00:31:51,011 --> 00:31:53,535
This is a free road, old man

296
00:31:53,635 --> 00:31:55,721
And I don't need your permission
to travel it.

297
00:31:55,821 --> 00:31:58,790
Give the lad a chance
to retract the remark.

298
00:32:02,812 --> 00:32:05,488
My sincere apologies.

299
00:32:06,856 --> 00:32:11,396
- Not to me, to him
- That I can not. He insulted me first.

300
00:32:14,708 --> 00:32:17,112
I'm going to teach this one some manners.

301
00:32:17,212 --> 00:32:19,570
go easy, Felson. Use the other hand.

302
00:32:19,670 --> 00:32:22,448
I don't want him dead.
Just send him on his way.

303
00:32:23,257 --> 00:32:25,306
Be quick about it.

304
00:32:25,690 --> 00:32:27,468
With pleasure

305
00:32:54,347 --> 00:32:56,382
What the devil was that?

306
00:32:56,697 --> 00:32:59,379
Stand and fight like a man,
you little jackrabbit.

307
00:33:13,184 --> 00:33:14,607
Enough!

308
00:33:17,071 --> 00:33:19,359
Perhaps you can be of service.

309
00:33:32,535 --> 00:33:37,164
I heard what the cardinal said,
about your heroism in the Crusades.

310
00:33:37,264 --> 00:33:40,276
I'd have gone too, but I was too young.

311
00:33:40,557 --> 00:33:43,687
you're one of the lucky ones!

312
00:33:43,787 --> 00:33:46,921
Well, tell me about it,
where did you enlist?

313
00:33:49,104 --> 00:33:52,537
It was a priest
how came to Felson's village .

314
00:33:52,637 --> 00:33:56,059
He told us:
"whoever went on Crusade, would receive blessings

315
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:59,077
from the church".. "Remission from sin".

316
00:33:59,177 --> 00:34:02,652
It was the part about sin that
perk young Felson is interest.

317
00:34:02,834 --> 00:34:04,052
That's not true.

318
00:34:04,334 --> 00:34:08,214
So he asks the priest :
"what sins would be forgiven"...

319
00:34:08,314 --> 00:34:10,184
"Would they forgive adultery?"

320
00:34:10,784 --> 00:34:16,398
The priest says :
"Yes, for two year bledge".

321
00:34:17,492 --> 00:34:19,073
"What about theft?"

322
00:34:19,473 --> 00:34:23,396
"Yes, for a three year bledge."

323
00:34:23,496 --> 00:34:27,824
So Felson mulls it over
and says to the priest.

324
00:34:27,924 --> 00:34:30,485
"better Sign me up for ten."

325
00:34:45,858 --> 00:34:47,676
I brought you some food ...

326
00:34:48,516 --> 00:34:51,258
and warmth.

327
00:34:55,481 --> 00:34:57,677
You're not like the others.

328
00:35:00,695 --> 00:35:02,879
You're kind.

329
00:35:17,961 --> 00:35:20,500
Was it Debelzaq, who hurt you?

330
00:35:26,432 --> 00:35:28,309
This place you taking me  ...

331
00:35:29,459 --> 00:35:31,204
What will happen to me there?

332
00:35:31,704 --> 00:35:34,901
Your innocence or
guilt will be decided

333
00:35:35,901 --> 00:35:39,705
There was a girl in my village
who was suspected of being a witch.

334
00:35:41,672 --> 00:35:47,072
They put stones in her pockets
and cast her into the lake.

335
00:35:47,172 --> 00:35:51,533
If she drown,
they would have known she was human.

336
00:35:51,633 --> 00:35:56,720
But she didn't. She lived.

337
00:35:57,081 --> 00:36:01,305
They called it proof of magic,
and burned at the stake.

338
00:36:01,675 --> 00:36:04,768
Nothing of the kind will happen to you.

339
00:36:04,868 --> 00:36:07,245
You will be given a fair trial.

340
00:36:08,165 --> 00:36:10,444
You have my word on that

341
00:36:18,337 --> 00:36:20,837
Did she said anything?

342
00:36:22,638 --> 00:36:26,438
- Why do you ask?
- I only mean to caution you!

343
00:36:27,250 --> 00:36:31,271
The witch is a deceiver.
She will turn one man against another.

344
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:36,343
who is to guard the wagon?

345
00:36:37,030 --> 00:36:40,322
Guard the wagon? That girl is kid.

346
00:36:41,443 --> 00:36:44,043
- And I'm tired.
- I'll go.

347
00:36:45,504 --> 00:36:48,276
Perhaps someone else
should take the first watch.

348
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:50,022
I'll go.

349
00:36:50,743 --> 00:36:54,724
Don't worry that. There will be
plenty of time between here and severak.

350
00:36:54,902 --> 00:36:57,432
Eckhart, be watch.

351
00:37:17,527 --> 00:37:20,386
I came to relieve you.

352
00:37:23,516 --> 00:37:25,667
you're not tired?

353
00:37:26,151 --> 00:37:28,469
No. No.

354
00:37:28,930 --> 00:37:32,129
I don't sleep much these days.

355
00:37:33,336 --> 00:37:37,995
I was thinking how much
the girl reminds me of my daughter.

356
00:37:38,990 --> 00:37:40,803
I'm sorry for your loss.

357
00:37:41,506 --> 00:37:47,130
- What was her name?
- Mila. Her name was Mila.

358
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:52,595
Tell me, Father ...

359
00:37:53,531 --> 00:37:57,309
You say the Cardinal has given his word
that she will have a fair trial.

360
00:37:57,540 --> 00:38:00,118
But has he not also
given his word end to the plague?

361
00:38:01,464 --> 00:38:02,895
What do you suggesting?

362
00:38:03,019 --> 00:38:08,069
Can you imagine the reaction of the people
if she weren't to be found guilty of witchcraft

363
00:38:09,013 --> 00:38:09,994
No Father...

364
00:38:10,201 --> 00:38:15,311
you know as well as I the
church can't afford that ...not now.

365
00:38:15,306 --> 00:38:16,327
No.

366
00:38:16,806 --> 00:38:20,627
No, our responsibility is
to deliver her for trail.

367
00:38:20,339 --> 00:38:22,830
The monks will decide her fate.

368
00:38:24,503 --> 00:38:25,910
Exactly.

369
00:38:26,722 --> 00:38:30,500
The monks will decide her fate.
and I will not be a part of this.

370
00:38:30,650 --> 00:38:34,219
No will the others, hopefully
when they have heard what I have to say

371
00:38:34,749 --> 00:38:35,781
Wait!

372
00:38:35,795 --> 00:38:37,544
Please don't go.

373
00:38:37,904 --> 00:38:40,550
Please, don't leave me alone with him.

374
00:38:40,758 --> 00:38:41,908
are you afraid?

375
00:38:45,311 --> 00:38:47,652
- Listen to me.
- Eckhart.

376
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:48,781
I'm not leave ...

377
00:38:50,951 --> 00:38:54,239
Give me that key!

378
00:39:02,559 --> 00:39:03,630
How did she escape?

379
00:39:06,989 --> 00:39:09,787
she took the key from around my neck.

380
00:39:10,613 --> 00:39:12,946
which way did she go?

381
00:39:20,724 --> 00:39:23,502
Maybe she
followed this road to the village.

382
00:39:37,335 --> 00:39:39,582
Kay and Eckhart that way

383
00:40:44,084 --> 00:40:45,808
She's in the square!

384
00:42:14,204 --> 00:42:18,397
this is a grave... this is a mass grave.

385
00:42:21,508 --> 00:42:23,106
Father

386
00:42:24,671 --> 00:42:25,747
Wait here.

387
00:42:35,309 --> 00:42:36,563
Papa

388
00:42:36,563 --> 00:42:37,953
Mila?

389
00:42:37,953 --> 00:42:39,739
Papa

390
00:42:41,145 --> 00:42:42,553
I'm here.

391
00:42:50,984 --> 00:42:53,015
Eckhart!

392
00:42:53,267 --> 00:42:55,204
- Mila?
- Papa

393
00:42:55,204 --> 00:42:58,068
- Mila ...
- Papa, where are you?

394
00:42:58,068 --> 00:43:02,366
- Mila! My child.
- Papa? is that you

395
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:05,696
- Don't run away!
- Papa.

396
00:43:06,126 --> 00:43:07,409
Mila ?

397
00:43:10,162 --> 00:43:13,939
- Papa.
- ohhhh, Mila?

398
00:43:17,253 --> 00:43:20,945
Eckhart!

399
00:43:21,689 --> 00:43:24,068
Felson! Behmen!

400
00:43:24,068 --> 00:43:25,891
Where you are?

401
00:43:26,366 --> 00:43:28,435
He came running out of no where

402
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:31,879
Why didn't he stopped?
Why didn't he see me?

403
00:43:33,643 --> 00:43:36,898
what dear God? what have I done?

404
00:43:38,758 --> 00:43:41,417
He looked me in the eye, but he didn't see me.

405
00:43:43,409 --> 00:43:45,957
She called me Mila.

406
00:43:56,636 --> 00:43:57,980
Behmen.

407
00:44:11,412 --> 00:44:13,819
I had to Run, I had no choice.

408
00:44:13,854 --> 00:44:16,226
I couldn't let him touch me again.

409
00:44:16,261 --> 00:44:17,276
I'm so sorry.

410
00:44:17,311 --> 00:44:19,851
Please, please, don't take me back there.

411
00:44:20,070 --> 00:44:23,560
Please, I beg you, please ...

412
00:44:33,672 --> 00:44:36,131
Heavenly Father, we pray thee.

413
00:44:36,166 --> 00:44:39,507
take thy servant Johan Eckhart,
down to the Heavenly realm

414
00:44:40,165 --> 00:44:43,007
For he was a soldier of the cross
and fought in thy name

415
00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:45,945
And in the name of Thy only Son,
Jesus Christ.

416
00:44:48,199 --> 00:44:50,774
And Thus did he die
for the glory of God.

417
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:53,745
Amen.

418
00:44:55,294 --> 00:44:56,284
Amen.

419
00:45:02,158 --> 00:45:03,972
Would anyone care to offer some words?

420
00:45:06,098 --> 00:45:09,237
let his sacrifice, not be in vain.

421
00:45:16,011 --> 00:45:17,519
Behmen!

422
00:45:18,743 --> 00:45:20,348
Behmen, I must speak with you

423
00:45:23,481 --> 00:45:26,971
- What is it now, Priest?
- You must warn the others
be careful in her presence. Not to...

424
00:45:27,070 --> 00:45:30,482
not to discuss personal matters,
things she might use against ...Listen to me!

425
00:45:31,501 --> 00:45:34,471
It was the witch killed Eckhart.

426
00:45:34,506 --> 00:45:37,443
You ...you heard what Kay said.
his mind wasn't his own.

427
00:45:37,478 --> 00:45:39,891
She overheard us talking of his daughter.

428
00:45:40,502 --> 00:45:42,840
What exactly are you suggesting?

429
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:45,949
She sees the weakness that lies in our hearts

430
00:45:46,402 --> 00:45:49,372
And once she sees that,
She will use against us.

431
00:46:37,114 --> 00:46:38,305
Crusader!

432
00:46:40,392 --> 00:46:42,165
I am truly grateful
for your help.

433
00:46:43,425 --> 00:46:44,804
You're very brave.

434
00:46:46,545 --> 00:46:49,838
A man like you could never stand
to see young girl come to any harm

435
00:46:50,734 --> 00:46:53,136
Debelzaq believes ,
you are the blame for Eckhart death.

436
00:46:54,649 --> 00:46:58,806
And you believe him?
After what he did to me?

437
00:47:00,125 --> 00:47:03,400
I had no reason to harm Eckhart
He was nothing but kind to me.

438
00:47:04,008 --> 00:47:05,712
He told me , I look like his daughter.

439
00:47:09,211 --> 00:47:11,448
I can see his death weighs heavy on your mind

440
00:47:15,026 --> 00:47:17,404
Allow me to ease your pain.

441
00:47:23,846 --> 00:47:27,593
Some good deeds can done
even from behind bars.

442
00:47:39,103 --> 00:47:42,484
Kay, remember this, it wasn't your fault.

443
00:47:43,284 --> 00:47:46,044
It was the witch.
No one else.

444
00:47:46,124 --> 00:47:47,884
he died by my sword.

445
00:47:47,919 --> 00:47:50,459
-It Could just as easily have been another's
- But it wasn't.

446
00:47:51,114 --> 00:47:54,283
It was mine. I killed him.

447
00:48:11,273 --> 00:48:13,125
Why are we stopped?

448
00:48:14,635 --> 00:48:16,738
You call that a bridge?

449
00:48:16,773 --> 00:48:18,995
Last time I saw it
Was eight or nine years ago.

450
00:48:19,693 --> 00:48:21,510
I remember it differently.

451
00:48:21,693 --> 00:48:24,123
is that our reward for taking a swindler as our guide.

452
00:48:24,193 --> 00:48:26,524
I told you,
I am not a swindler

453
00:48:26,559 --> 00:48:28,856
You're not much of a guide either,
are you?!

454
00:48:30,762 --> 00:48:32,167
How we are supposed to get across this rotting temper
{ temper= The degree of rigidity and flexibility}

455
00:48:32,201 --> 00:48:33,585
Behmen!

456
00:48:34,737 --> 00:48:36,281
Behmen!

457
00:49:25,022 --> 00:49:29,064
Take everything of the wagon
bring the horses across. One by one.

458
00:49:42,123 --> 00:49:44,032
It will be on my count of three.

459
00:49:54,626 --> 00:49:58,033
One, two, three!

460
00:50:22,054 --> 00:50:24,310
My hands!

461
00:50:27,584 --> 00:50:28,602
ahhhhh...!

462
00:50:29,357 --> 00:50:31,531
Cann't hold out much longer!

463
00:50:49,531 --> 00:50:50,911
Help!

464
00:51:07,205 --> 00:51:11,455
Hagamar, hitch a rope to the horses,
that we will use them to pull the wagon.

465
00:51:57,839 --> 00:52:00,521
If you let me out,
it'll be lighter.

466
00:52:01,607 --> 00:52:03,386
Please, I can help.

467
00:52:04,864 --> 00:52:06,957
- It won't hold.
- It will

468
00:52:07,228 --> 00:52:08,301
Push.

469
00:52:15,484 --> 00:52:17,468
Push!

470
00:52:20,365 --> 00:52:24,465
You won't make it. Let me out.

471
00:52:31,784 --> 00:52:33,667
- Come on!
- Push!

472
00:52:52,443 --> 00:52:54,100
That was a little too close!

473
00:52:54,975 --> 00:52:58,573
I've saved your ass a hundred times.
Have a little faith!

474
00:53:02,500 --> 00:53:05,825
Kay, bring me a fresh wrap Priest hand.

475
00:53:06,139 --> 00:53:08,278
It would be a shame
if you bleed to death

476
00:53:15,525 --> 00:53:17,214
Thank you

477
00:53:35,322 --> 00:53:36,719
Felson

478
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:44,511
The flask!

479
00:53:46,002 --> 00:53:47,403
Really?

480
00:53:59,862 --> 00:54:01,210
What is this place?

481
00:54:04,687 --> 00:54:06,751
Hagamar, where are we?

482
00:54:08,781 --> 00:54:10,421
Wormwood forest.

483
00:54:37,450 --> 00:54:40,158
Damn fog. Like a veil before my eyes.

484
00:54:40,396 --> 00:54:41,904
We haven't strayed from the path,
have we?

485
00:54:41,939 --> 00:54:44,125
I can barely see my own hand
in front of my face.

486
00:54:44,771 --> 00:54:47,501
The only reason you're around
is because you claimed you knew the way.

487
00:54:47,975 --> 00:54:49,606
I know the way,
it's just I can't see the way.

488
00:54:51,192 --> 00:54:53,794
Maybe you would like to
try leading the way! Huh!

489
00:54:55,190 --> 00:54:56,370
Enough!

490
00:54:56,441 --> 00:54:57,703
Both of you.

491
00:54:58,300 --> 00:55:01,611
We camp here on the road.
Wait for the fog to pass.

492
00:55:27,573 --> 00:55:29,368
Kay told me
what happened on the bridge.

493
00:55:30,932 --> 00:55:32,274
He says , you saved his life.

494
00:55:33,588 --> 00:55:36,785
With one hand ... Hard to believe.

495
00:55:38,384 --> 00:55:41,156
We believe what we want to believe.

496
00:55:44,970 --> 00:55:46,792
Do you believe I am a witch,
Behmen?

497
00:55:50,071 --> 00:55:53,424
You are not afraid of me, are you?

498
00:56:27,387 --> 00:56:29,359
Trouble sleeping?

499
00:56:31,066 --> 00:56:32,333
Myself as well

500
00:56:36,207 --> 00:56:39,239
I'm not sure if it's the fog,  the altitude ...

501
00:56:40,167 --> 00:56:43,760
It's unsettling, even for a knight.

502
00:56:45,021 --> 00:56:47,521
Let alone with a spineless scoundral like myself!

503
00:56:47,879 --> 00:56:49,709
That's not what I meant.

504
00:56:51,638 --> 00:56:57,255
No! Behmen, how many more are
going to die before we reach a Severak?

505
00:56:57,479 --> 00:57:01,360
- None, if I can help it.
- And if you can't , what then what?

506
00:57:02,445 --> 00:57:05,373
Forgive me if I seem reluctant
to put my life in your hands

507
00:57:05,807 --> 00:57:08,604
But I have a better solution.
We kill the bitch!

508
00:57:08,639 --> 00:57:10,111
Here and now, be done with it

509
00:57:10,146 --> 00:57:12,272
We tell whose back in "Mol bow",
she tried to escape.

510
00:57:12,634 --> 00:57:15,271
She meant us harm ...
What can we do? we had no choice.

511
00:57:17,007 --> 00:57:19,583
And who will be the wiser?

512
00:57:23,100 --> 00:57:24,436
I, for one.

513
00:57:34,637 --> 00:57:35,836
Did you hear that?

514
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,002
- What it's it? What is happening?
- Listen.

515
00:57:38,300 --> 00:57:39,439
Quite.

516
00:57:55,834 --> 00:57:58,187
Wolfs

517
00:58:04,261 --> 00:58:05,249
What do we do?

518
00:58:09,374 --> 00:58:11,538
Kill as many as you can.

519
00:59:20,365 --> 00:59:24,468
-Oh no.
- Get the horses, I'll take the wagon.

520
01:00:24,643 --> 01:00:26,221
Behmen!

521
01:00:30,166 --> 01:00:32,543
It's too late. We cann't help him.

522
01:01:24,749 --> 01:01:26,898
Behmen! What are you doing?

523
01:01:28,806 --> 01:01:29,669
Behmen, what are you doing?

524
01:01:30,041 --> 01:01:34,078
- he's doing what comes naturally killing the innocent.
- You can not do this

525
01:01:34,300 --> 01:01:36,442
Step aside,
two lifes have already been lost.

526
01:01:36,869 --> 01:01:38,519
No one grieves for that
more than I.

527
01:01:38,554 --> 01:01:40,618
Step aside! or this arrow will be yours!

528
01:01:41,008 --> 01:01:43,190
If we fault her now,
those lives will have been lost in vain

529
01:01:43,393 --> 01:01:46,476
Or will not be lost!!
Four lifes will be spared.

530
01:01:46,511 --> 01:01:49,097
And what are four lives, compared
with the thousands more will be lost?

531
01:01:49,132 --> 01:01:50,394
if this plague is not ended.

532
01:01:50,453 --> 01:01:52,828
I know, there may be no room
in your heart for God, Behmen.

533
01:01:53,103 --> 01:01:55,490
But in my heart
I know he would not abandon us.

534
01:01:55,723 --> 01:01:57,133
I God's name ...

535
01:01:57,882 --> 01:02:03,506
No man has spilt more blood
in God's name than I

536
01:02:04,875 --> 01:02:07,813
benevolent God,
what are odds thus takes a man

537
01:02:09,321 --> 01:02:12,248
If you kill her,
you will not have God to blame

538
01:02:13,558 --> 01:02:14,947
only yourself.

539
01:02:27,508 --> 01:02:30,086
He ends the say

540
01:02:31,117 --> 01:02:34,544
Look. Severak ...

541
01:02:53,800 --> 01:02:55,777
We've come a long way, Behmen.

542
01:02:56,382 --> 01:03:00,727
Crossed oceans , deserts of ...
Seen things a few men have seen

543
01:03:04,652 --> 01:03:08,041
When this is over,
I think I like see the valley where I was born.

544
01:03:09,015 --> 01:03:10,541
And you?

545
01:03:10,887 --> 01:03:12,838
I have no such yearnings for home.

546
01:03:13,041 --> 01:03:14,605
Ohh ...Then come with me.

547
01:03:14,855 --> 01:03:21,122
I will show you my home and we will sit in the hall
where my forefathers sat and a drink ale .

548
01:03:22,038 --> 01:03:24,906
And tell tales, few men have lived to tell

549
01:03:25,401 --> 01:03:27,401
A fewer still will believe!

550
01:03:28,500 --> 01:03:32,606
Either we'll know the truth,
my friend. We'll know, ...

551
01:03:49,393 --> 01:03:51,403
Hello!

552
01:03:55,155 --> 01:03:56,754
Is anyone there?

553
01:04:44,975 --> 01:04:46,970
- Where are the monks?
- The chapel.

554
01:04:47,052 --> 01:04:48,565
At this time , they should be in vespers.

555
01:04:59,472 --> 01:05:01,955
My brothers, forgive the intrusion,
But we have travelled far.

556
01:05:27,762 --> 01:05:29,560
It cann't be!

557
01:05:32,641 --> 01:05:33,973
He would not abandon us.

558
01:05:36,353 --> 01:05:38,060
God would not abandon us.

559
01:05:49,761 --> 01:05:54,679
We must go,
There is no hope here. Only the plague ...

560
01:05:55,455 --> 01:05:56,434
Go where ?

561
01:05:58,636 --> 01:06:00,919
these men were our hope

562
01:06:02,293 --> 01:06:06,341
We are in God's hands now
Prayer is our only salvation.

563
01:06:07,746 --> 01:06:10,968
- Our Lord in heaven, Hallowed be thy name ...
- Debelzaq!

564
01:06:11,203 --> 01:06:14,152
- Thy kingdom come, They will be done ...
- Debelzaq!

565
01:06:14,187 --> 01:06:15,074
...as it is in heaven

566
01:06:15,209 --> 01:06:17,823
Give us this day, our daily bread
and forgive us our trespasses

567
01:06:18,076 --> 01:06:18,818
Get up!

568
01:06:18,903 --> 01:06:19,922
We forgive those how trespass against us

569
01:06:19,957 --> 01:06:20,622
Get up!

570
01:06:20,727 --> 01:06:22,336
And lead us nary to temptation

571
01:06:22,501 --> 01:06:25,045
But deliver us from evil ..

572
01:06:59,322 --> 01:07:00,300
Debelzaq ...

573
01:07:07,820 --> 01:07:10,206
.....

574
01:07:11,722 --> 01:07:14,729
the Key of Solomon
book of which the cardinal spoke.

575
01:07:16,104 --> 01:07:19,485
Within this pages is saved to be
all the rituals, prayers, and incantations

576
01:07:19,520 --> 01:07:22,157
Used by holy men ,
throughout the ages

577
01:07:22,192 --> 01:07:23,880
To defend against the forces of evil

578
01:07:25,380 --> 01:07:26,865
Can ...

579
01:07:27,745 --> 01:07:29,857
... You perform the ritual?

580
01:07:40,704 --> 01:07:42,365
What have we here?

581
01:07:42,726 --> 01:07:45,688
Is this the fair trial
you promised me, Behmen?

582
01:07:46,035 --> 01:07:48,664
you see with your own fate.

583
01:07:54,136 --> 01:07:57,035
Let it be known to all here present
And before God, himself

584
01:07:57,133 --> 01:08:00,256
That this woman
stands accused of witchcraft,

585
01:08:00,291 --> 01:08:03,386
That she is admitted to call up the plague
against all mankind.

586
01:08:03,760 --> 01:08:05,283
I'm flattered.

587
01:08:05,685 --> 01:08:07,328
But I must confess ...

588
01:08:08,969 --> 01:08:11,176
I have deceived you ...

589
01:08:11,211 --> 01:08:13,597
You think you can save yourself by recanting
But you're wrong

590
01:08:13,812 --> 01:08:15,440
Speak the truth now before God!

591
01:08:15,581 --> 01:08:16,560
The Truth?

592
01:08:17,552 --> 01:08:19,860
Do not talk to me of the truth,
you hypocrite

593
01:08:21,252 --> 01:08:25,720
For centuries you and your ilk
have been burning, hanging, crucifying

594
01:08:25,818 --> 01:08:27,896
Anyone who stood in their way.

595
01:08:31,703 --> 01:08:33,508
In truth, I shall thank you.

596
01:08:34,308 --> 01:08:36,258
The church has sent more souls
to Perdition

597
01:08:36,476 --> 01:08:40,319
than all of the wars, famines
and pestilences is put together.

598
01:08:41,101 --> 01:08:42,354
That's a lie, Witch!

599
01:08:42,389 --> 01:08:44,092
Debelzaq, the ritual!

600
01:09:00,790 --> 01:09:03,962
And you, Behmen?
All you needed was a child to save .

601
01:09:05,092 --> 01:09:08,307
Someone to ease your pitiful guilt

602
01:09:08,956 --> 01:09:12,365
Do you truly think that saving
one racked wave, would change anything?

603
01:09:13,823 --> 01:09:17,177
Come Behmen. Your sins are legend.

604
01:09:17,600 --> 01:09:20,855
How many innocent
have fallen beneath that very blade?

605
01:09:23,038 --> 01:09:26,234
They are godless people, Infidels

606
01:09:26,399 --> 01:09:30,431
They sinned against God and
against his only son, Jesus Christ!

607
01:09:30,466 --> 01:09:32,100
They must be punished

608
01:09:33,696 --> 01:09:35,074
How could you know?

609
01:09:38,978 --> 01:09:40,934
This no witch!

610
01:09:41,856 --> 01:09:43,484
This no witch!

611
01:09:53,457 --> 01:09:54,945
Do not utter those words!

612
01:11:17,161 --> 01:11:18,954
We're goanna need more
Holy water .

613
01:11:26,586 --> 01:11:27,809
Here!

614
01:11:31,462 --> 01:11:32,689
Tell me, Behmen ...

615
01:11:34,504 --> 01:11:39,162
Are we going in there to defeat
the demon or to save the girl?

616
01:11:41,304 --> 01:11:42,378
Both.

617
01:11:50,222 --> 01:11:51,814
I have found more holy water.

618
01:11:52,504 --> 01:11:53,942
You've done well.

619
01:11:56,380 --> 01:11:59,537
- This as far as you go, Kay.
- I don't understand ...

620
01:12:00,162 --> 01:12:01,684
This's not your battle.

621
01:12:02,099 --> 01:12:05,106
I took a vow to join your cause.

622
01:12:05,475 --> 01:12:08,976
I Release you from your vow
There's no shame in it.

623
01:12:09,804 --> 01:12:13,765
Honour is not as thing
to be dismissed or forgotten.

624
01:12:15,277 --> 01:12:18,584
A vow must be fulfilled ,
else, there is no vow at all.

625
01:12:19,078 --> 01:12:22,144
- Even are the cost of your life?
- Even then.

626
01:12:32,484 --> 01:12:34,060
Kneel, Kay.

627
01:12:36,872 --> 01:12:38,464
Speak after me.

628
01:12:39,301 --> 01:12:42,535
- Grant me courage Lord ...
- Grant me courage Lord ...

629
01:12:43,549 --> 01:12:46,887
- For I'm thy servant.
- For I'm thy servant.

630
01:12:48,366 --> 01:12:52,427
- And guard me with strength into battle...
- And guard me with strength into battle...

631
01:12:52,676 --> 01:12:55,521
- That I may destroy thin enemies ...
- That I may destroy thin enemies ...

632
01:12:56,213 --> 01:13:00,832
- As dust before the wind.
- As dust before the wind.

633
01:13:02,741 --> 01:13:04,570
- Amen.
- Amen.

634
01:13:04,866 --> 01:13:06,072
Amen.

635
01:13:09,377 --> 01:13:11,492
Rise a knight.

636
01:13:21,637 --> 01:13:25,366
- Felson.
- What is it?

637
01:13:26,492 --> 01:13:28,854
I know in my heart,
I haven't earned this.

638
01:13:33,414 --> 01:13:35,475
You will ...

639
01:13:46,838 --> 01:13:48,794
The demon could've escaped anytime.

640
01:13:49,152 --> 01:13:51,173
Why did it wait until we reach Severak?

641
01:13:51,208 --> 01:13:53,194
Perhaps escape wasn't it's purpose.

642
01:13:54,563 --> 01:13:56,230
It wants to be here.

643
01:13:56,916 --> 01:13:59,841
Debelzaq, You said
Eckhart tried to free her.

644
01:14:00,367 --> 01:14:01,944
and I will not be a part of this.

645
01:14:02,148 --> 01:14:03,227
- Papa!
- Mila?

646
01:14:04,900 --> 01:14:08,923
and it killed him, and Hagamar too.
He stood in it's way.

647
01:14:09,985 --> 01:14:12,397
We kill the bitch!
Here and now, be done with it

648
01:14:16,489 --> 01:14:19,129
It wanted to come here
from the very beginning.

649
01:14:19,532 --> 01:14:20,762
My God!

650
01:14:21,453 --> 01:14:23,121
The sooner we get her to
Severak, the better.

651
01:14:23,386 --> 01:14:25,978
He's right. Everything it's done,
has led us here.

652
01:14:48,075 --> 01:14:49,589
Over Here.

653
01:15:02,737 --> 01:15:05,143
Why would a dying monk
do this to himself?

654
01:15:06,067 --> 01:15:08,022
Why would he tie himself to a desk?

655
01:15:09,174 --> 01:15:10,878
It's a passage from Book of Solomon.

656
01:15:24,175 --> 01:15:25,539
Have more over here

657
01:15:31,299 --> 01:15:32,612
And more.

658
01:15:44,043 --> 01:15:45,158
They were copying it.

659
01:15:46,286 --> 01:15:48,954
To spread the wisdom of Solomon
to all the corners of the earth

660
01:15:48,989 --> 01:15:50,953
..... the bias might beyond

661
01:15:54,357 --> 01:15:55,481
It wants the book!

662
01:15:57,606 --> 01:16:00,659
That why the demon deceived us
into believe in the girl was witch.

663
01:16:01,941 --> 01:16:05,622
It knew that a witch will be brought to those
who possess the Book of Solomon.

664
01:16:07,254 --> 01:16:09,357
You've seen what this plague has done ...

665
01:16:10,606 --> 01:16:13,170
If the book would've fall
into the demon's hands,

666
01:16:13,453 --> 01:16:16,734
We would face an endless darkness.

667
01:16:17,732 --> 01:16:19,785
It's our last defence.

668
01:16:20,032 --> 01:16:22,232
I should thank all of you.

669
01:16:23,548 --> 01:16:27,549
You sacrificed so much
to deliver me here

670
01:16:28,140 --> 01:16:31,249
And now you've brought me the book.

671
01:16:35,629 --> 01:16:37,068
Debelzaq ...

672
01:16:43,062 --> 01:16:44,297
Silence!

673
01:16:46,171 --> 01:16:47,641
- Watch out!
- Behmen!

674
01:17:07,203 --> 01:17:08,204
Where are they?

675
01:17:09,107 --> 01:17:11,954
- Who?
- The Monks?

676
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:21,458
You can weaken it!
you have to keep reading.

677
01:18:08,793 --> 01:18:10,905
The head ...
Cut off their heads!

678
01:18:35,734 --> 01:18:37,410
They're like cockroaches.

679
01:18:42,260 --> 01:18:43,350
Felson

680
01:20:28,755 --> 01:20:32,693
You have no idea how bad cause of book
Cause to me till over the centuries

681
01:20:34,657 --> 01:20:37,766
I destroyed the others.
This is the last one.

682
01:20:47,677 --> 01:20:49,861
you'll be buying tonight my friend.

683
01:21:24,228 --> 01:21:25,833
Felson!

684
01:21:46,794 --> 01:21:48,802
Finish it!

685
01:23:16,029 --> 01:23:17,183
Behmen ...

686
01:23:28,712 --> 01:23:30,374
What can I do?

687
01:23:33,901 --> 01:23:35,613
Keep her safe.

688
01:24:21,051 --> 01:24:22,924
God be with you, Felson.

689
01:24:32,158 --> 01:24:33,468
It's strange ...

690
01:24:36,111 --> 01:24:38,982
To owe so much
to someone I've never even knew.

691
01:24:41,171 --> 01:24:42,906
I don't know what to say.

692
01:24:45,478 --> 01:24:47,627
Say what is within your heart.

693
01:24:52,304 --> 01:24:54,265
My name is Anna.

694
01:24:56,484 --> 01:24:58,108
I owe you my life.

695
01:25:00,277 --> 01:25:01,851
God keep you.

696
01:25:22,683 --> 01:25:25,001
will you tell me about them?

697
01:25:25,943 --> 01:25:27,760
I want to know them.

698
01:25:44,076 --> 01:25:47,572
So the plague past
and life returned to the land

699
01:25:49,205 --> 01:25:53,402
There are Many who Say the plague was nothing
but a pestilence that finally broke,

700
01:25:54,028 --> 01:25:56,317
Like the passing of a fever.

701
01:25:57,131 --> 01:26:00,381
They don't know the darkness
that almost was.

702
01:26:01,130 --> 01:26:03,302
The sacrifices made ...

703
01:26:03,756 --> 01:26:05,604
The heroes lost ...

704
01:26:06,819 --> 01:26:08,934
