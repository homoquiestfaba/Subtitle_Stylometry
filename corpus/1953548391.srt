1
00:01:17,093 --> 00:01:21,928
Sold to the gentleman
in the aisle for $25,000.

2
00:01:22,098 --> 00:01:23,622
Thank you.

3
00:01:23,867 --> 00:01:27,997
And now showing Lot 151,
another beautiful piece...

4
00:01:28,171 --> 00:01:30,731
...from our Imperial Russian collection.

5
00:01:30,907 --> 00:01:35,844
A very rare Fabergé ruby
and diamond-encrusted egg...

6
00:01:36,012 --> 00:01:41,609
...given to the Empress Maria Alexandrovna
circa 1865.

7
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:54,727
Thirty seconds.

8
00:03:09,639 --> 00:03:11,834
That job was a fucking joke.

9
00:03:12,008 --> 00:03:13,999
They were begging us
to nick those diamonds.

10
00:03:14,177 --> 00:03:17,271
What was with the countdown?
We had another two minutes.

11
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:20,143
The hotel stops serving breakfast at 11.

12
00:03:58,221 --> 00:03:59,950
Look out.

13
00:05:22,705 --> 00:05:24,832
Where are my diamonds?

14
00:05:26,876 --> 00:05:29,811
I'm sorry, Mr. Groznyi.
It wasn't my fault.

15
00:05:30,179 --> 00:05:32,340
Everything was going perfect.
This dog came...

16
00:05:32,515 --> 00:05:38,476
That is not what I asked you.
Where are my diamonds?

17
00:05:39,355 --> 00:05:40,788
Right.

18
00:05:42,692 --> 00:05:44,990
Look, it was an accident.
We were driving along...

19
00:05:45,161 --> 00:05:47,789
Do you or do you not
have my diamonds?

20
00:05:47,964 --> 00:05:51,422
And if you mention a dog one more time,
I swear I will fucking kill you.

21
00:05:52,802 --> 00:05:55,498
No. I don't have your diamonds.

22
00:05:58,174 --> 00:06:00,199
Oh, Ritchie.

23
00:06:03,479 --> 00:06:05,879
What are we going to do with you?

24
00:06:06,349 --> 00:06:10,376
I help your mother get out of Russia
and start a new life in America.

25
00:06:11,821 --> 00:06:15,279
I treat you like the family.
You, almost like a son.

26
00:06:15,591 --> 00:06:17,456
No, no, this cannot be.

27
00:06:17,627 --> 00:06:20,619
It was on the understanding
that I would get paid back in full.

28
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:24,426
That was 20 years ago
and still the bill has not been settled.

29
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:29,060
This job was for you
to square your family debt to me away.

30
00:06:29,238 --> 00:06:33,698
I know, Mr. Groznyi, and I'm sorry.
I mean, I've never let you down.

31
00:06:39,248 --> 00:06:40,738
So, uh...

32
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:42,874
...when's my flight back to L.A.?

33
00:06:43,052 --> 00:06:46,317
Shut up about Los Angeles, Ritchie,
you're not going back to L.A.

34
00:06:46,889 --> 00:06:51,519
I've decided to give you one more chance.
Open, please.

35
00:06:52,728 --> 00:06:55,196
This priceless artifact...

36
00:06:55,364 --> 00:07:01,735
...once belonged to the first czar of Russia,
Ivan IV.

37
00:07:01,904 --> 00:07:05,169
And soon, thanks to you,
it will belong to me.

38
00:07:05,541 --> 00:07:09,170
You see, the family who have it now,
they also own Eurals...

39
00:07:09,345 --> 00:07:10,972
...which is probably the biggest...

40
00:07:11,147 --> 00:07:14,310
...international multimedia company
in the world.

41
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:22,684
They live on the penthouse floor
of the company headquarters.

42
00:07:23,192 --> 00:07:27,094
That is where the cross is.

43
00:07:27,730 --> 00:07:29,459
I want that cross, Ritchie.

44
00:07:31,067 --> 00:07:34,764
This job is very important to me,
you understand?

45
00:07:35,905 --> 00:07:40,865
So don't fuck it up,
for your own sake. Okay?

46
00:07:41,944 --> 00:07:43,434
I understand.

47
00:07:46,149 --> 00:07:52,019
So good, it is agreed.

48
00:07:52,221 --> 00:07:56,157
You will meet my men
and you'll be in and out...

49
00:07:56,559 --> 00:07:58,322
...in one day.

50
00:08:06,269 --> 00:08:08,430
That wasn't so bad.

51
00:08:09,105 --> 00:08:11,630
- In and out of where?
- Moscow.

52
00:08:32,995 --> 00:08:35,987
Hello, my name is Peter.
This is my brother, Yuri.

53
00:08:36,165 --> 00:08:39,100
- Hey, how are you?
- Open the door. Open the door.

54
00:08:39,268 --> 00:08:42,101
- I'm doing.
- Thanks.

55
00:11:02,611 --> 00:11:04,135
You got that, didn't you?

56
00:11:40,449 --> 00:11:43,543
Get down and shut the fuck up!

57
00:11:49,792 --> 00:11:50,884
Yuri, Yuri, hurry up!

58
00:11:51,861 --> 00:11:53,988
Yuri!

59
00:11:59,902 --> 00:12:03,531
Hey, Ritchie, too easy, eh? Ha-ha-ha.

60
00:12:04,106 --> 00:12:05,767
Fucking crybaby.

61
00:12:05,941 --> 00:12:08,307
I cannot believe you are my brother.

62
00:12:09,812 --> 00:12:11,370
Get him up.

63
00:12:15,985 --> 00:12:20,388
Oh, ladies, ladies, please, this lift is full.
Get the next lift, please?

64
00:12:20,556 --> 00:12:25,323
Did you not hear what I said?
This lift is full. Please take...

65
00:12:26,429 --> 00:12:28,659
Take the next lift, please.

66
00:12:29,899 --> 00:12:35,030
Am I still here? Am I still here?
Hello, can anybody see me?

67
00:12:35,204 --> 00:12:37,399
- Leave it alone.
- No, no, no.

68
00:12:37,573 --> 00:12:40,701
Ladies, please. Get off the fucking lift!

69
00:12:42,545 --> 00:12:44,740
- Please, this way.
Thank you.

70
00:12:44,914 --> 00:12:48,077
- No, no, no.
- That was lucky.

71
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:50,013
Where did everybody come from?

72
00:12:50,186 --> 00:12:53,519
Please get the fuck out of the lift.
Please. Please.

73
00:12:53,689 --> 00:12:58,524
Hey, it's you. You, you fucking old bitch.

74
00:12:58,694 --> 00:13:01,185
- Hey, leave it alone, all right?
- You're...

75
00:13:23,686 --> 00:13:26,382
- Oh, God.
- Blasphemy is a sin.

76
00:13:28,290 --> 00:13:32,283
You've got a walkie-talkie.
Why don't you call someone?

77
00:13:32,461 --> 00:13:34,554
Let them know
there's been a breakdown.

78
00:13:36,532 --> 00:13:38,397
<i>Attention all security.</i>

79
00:13:38,567 --> 00:13:42,059
<i>A female member of staff has been killed
during a robbery on the penthouse.</i>

80
00:13:43,606 --> 00:13:45,540
<i>Report to central security
on the ground floor.</i>

81
00:13:45,708 --> 00:13:47,300
<i>- Hey, Yuri.
- Extreme caution is required.</i>

82
00:13:47,476 --> 00:13:50,707
<i>- I repeat. They have killed once already.
- It's my brother, he's okay.</i>

83
00:13:54,149 --> 00:13:55,241
He killed...

84
00:13:56,085 --> 00:14:01,455
Nobody fucking move!
Everybody stand still. Come on.

85
00:14:01,624 --> 00:14:06,891
- Hey, just get them all out! Get them out!
- Okay, okay, everybody nice and easy.

86
00:14:07,062 --> 00:14:10,498
Line up against the wall. And you, big guy.
Come on. Come on.

87
00:14:16,438 --> 00:14:20,636
Stand there
and don't make a fucking squeak.

88
00:14:25,514 --> 00:14:28,381
Who's the fucking big shot?

89
00:14:40,162 --> 00:14:41,493
Anyone else?

90
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,433
Hey.

91
00:14:46,869 --> 00:14:49,463
You run again and I'll hurt you.
Come on.

92
00:14:54,577 --> 00:14:56,511
Drop it.

93
00:14:57,513 --> 00:14:59,481
Stamp on it.

94
00:15:03,252 --> 00:15:04,583
Fucking hell!

95
00:15:07,690 --> 00:15:12,559
So if any of you fuckers
tries anything...

96
00:15:12,728 --> 00:15:17,665
...I will stamp on your heads
until your brains come out of your nose!

97
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:21,164
Let me make this perfectly clear.

98
00:15:21,337 --> 00:15:24,932
This is not Christmas,
I am not Santa Claus...

99
00:15:25,107 --> 00:15:30,977
...but on the other hand, if you are
looking for a bloodbath, ha-ha-ha...

100
00:15:31,547 --> 00:15:33,742
...then I am your man!

101
00:15:43,592 --> 00:15:45,184
Get over there.

102
00:15:47,763 --> 00:15:49,788
You took your time.
Did you see anyone else?

103
00:15:49,965 --> 00:15:53,059
No, I didn't. This floor looks like
it's still under construction.

104
00:15:53,235 --> 00:15:55,795
Just our luck, eh?
The fucking lift, it breaks down.

105
00:15:55,971 --> 00:15:59,202
It didn't break down. Security's onto us.

106
00:16:00,342 --> 00:16:02,003
Where's your brother?

107
00:16:05,781 --> 00:16:08,215
Get out of the damned lift, Yuri!

108
00:16:13,322 --> 00:16:16,917
Yuri, you gotta get up.
We can't stay here.

109
00:16:18,227 --> 00:16:19,717
Yuri.

110
00:16:20,129 --> 00:16:22,359
He didn't have to kill her.

111
00:16:23,565 --> 00:16:26,830
Look, I'm not too happy about that
either, okay?

112
00:16:27,002 --> 00:16:28,902
We gotta keep our heads
so we can get out.

113
00:16:29,071 --> 00:16:31,904
You'll tell them I had nothing to do with it
if we get caught?

114
00:16:32,074 --> 00:16:35,475
- We're not gonna get caught.
- Peter will blame me. He always does.

115
00:16:35,644 --> 00:16:37,805
Let's just try to forget about him
right now.

116
00:16:38,213 --> 00:16:41,080
Okay. Can I have my sandwich now?

117
00:16:41,483 --> 00:16:43,246
What sandwich?

118
00:16:44,553 --> 00:16:48,387
- I don't have any fucking sandwiches.
- I brought my own.

119
00:16:51,593 --> 00:16:52,958
Just get up.

120
00:16:56,565 --> 00:17:00,001
Yuri, don't stand there, you idiot,
you're one of...

121
00:17:00,803 --> 00:17:02,998
We gotta get the hell away from here.
Come on, let's go.

122
00:17:03,172 --> 00:17:05,834
Ah-ah-ah. I'll take that.

123
00:17:09,678 --> 00:17:12,647
- Come on. Keep moving.
- Aah!

124
00:17:12,815 --> 00:17:17,946
What the fuck you looking at?
No running away, okay?

125
00:17:22,858 --> 00:17:25,053
All right, everybody just wait.

126
00:17:35,771 --> 00:17:40,140
All right, everybody, in here. Come on.
Let's go.

127
00:17:41,009 --> 00:17:42,738
Just sit down and shut up.

128
00:17:52,287 --> 00:17:53,549
Let us get this straight.

129
00:17:53,722 --> 00:17:57,123
You are saying that the security,
the building security stopped the lift?

130
00:17:57,292 --> 00:17:58,589
We don't have time for this.

131
00:17:58,961 --> 00:18:02,260
You wanna get out of here, move fast.
The cops will be here any minute.

132
00:18:02,431 --> 00:18:05,491
No, no, no. Answer the question.

133
00:18:05,667 --> 00:18:09,763
Did you or did you not say
that security stopped the lift?

134
00:18:09,938 --> 00:18:11,269
Who else could it have been?

135
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:15,103
And it was your job to make sure
that the cameras were switched off.

136
00:18:15,444 --> 00:18:17,412
What are you trying to say to me?

137
00:18:18,614 --> 00:18:25,110
I am saying that if security stopped the lift,
it means that they saw us.

138
00:18:25,287 --> 00:18:29,189
If they saw us, it means the cameras
were up and running.

139
00:18:29,358 --> 00:18:33,192
If the cameras were up and running,
it means you fucked up!

140
00:18:33,362 --> 00:18:37,025
I didn't fuck anything up.
The cameras were down.

141
00:18:37,199 --> 00:18:40,635
- How did they know to stop the lift?
- I don't know. Maybe somebody saw us.

142
00:18:40,803 --> 00:18:46,036
- Maybe we missed something.
- Yes, yes, yes, very convenient.

143
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:49,507
Maybe they heard the screaming
from the woman that you killed.

144
00:18:49,812 --> 00:18:53,077
Why did you do it anyway?
That wasn't part of the goddamn plan.

145
00:18:53,248 --> 00:18:55,808
So what? I changed the plan.

146
00:18:56,418 --> 00:19:00,787
One less middle-aged bitch in this world.
Big wow.

147
00:19:05,961 --> 00:19:08,225
- Where's Yuri?
- What?

148
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:09,830
Ah...

149
00:19:20,075 --> 00:19:22,805
You are a fucking embarrassment.

150
00:19:25,414 --> 00:19:28,508
Stay there. Hmm?

151
00:19:30,252 --> 00:19:32,618
<i>Officer
Bogdanovich, are you receiving me?</i>

152
00:19:33,755 --> 00:19:35,814
- Hey, give it to me.
- Ah-ah-ah.

153
00:19:35,991 --> 00:19:38,289
- Peter.
- No, he isn't here...

154
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:40,428
...you fucking pig scum!
- Hey.

155
00:19:40,762 --> 00:19:44,198
<i>- Who is this?
- I am one of the men you are looking for.</i>

156
00:19:44,366 --> 00:19:46,857
And don't try any funny stuff.

157
00:19:47,035 --> 00:19:50,766
We have hostages,
and if I see even one of you pigs...

158
00:19:50,939 --> 00:19:53,464
...more bitches will get it
like the one upstairs.

159
00:19:53,942 --> 00:19:59,039
- This is not Christmas. I am not Santa...
- That was my sandwich.

160
00:20:00,148 --> 00:20:02,412
Yuri, Yuri, Yu...

161
00:20:02,584 --> 00:20:05,451
Listen to me. You stay where you are
and nobody will get hurt.

162
00:20:05,621 --> 00:20:08,146
<i>- What happened to the other man?
Not the hair.</i>

163
00:20:08,323 --> 00:20:10,848
He's indisposed.
From now on, you're talking to me.

164
00:20:11,026 --> 00:20:13,688
<i>If you give up the hostages,
we will make a deal with you.</i>

165
00:20:13,862 --> 00:20:16,262
You think I'm an idiot?
I give you the hostages...

166
00:20:16,431 --> 00:20:18,126
...and you'll come with a SWAT team.

167
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:19,597
Stay down. Stay down.
- No.

168
00:20:19,768 --> 00:20:21,633
This is what we're gonna do.

169
00:20:21,803 --> 00:20:25,239
I'll give you one hostage, you guarantee
not to make a move on the floor.

170
00:20:25,574 --> 00:20:27,565
- Say you're sorry.
- I'm sorry.

171
00:20:28,243 --> 00:20:31,576
- And you will not do it again.
- I promise. I promise, just get off.

172
00:20:31,747 --> 00:20:35,114
<i>- You'll leave the hostage at the elevator.
- Okay.</i>

173
00:20:36,818 --> 00:20:39,616
It was only a fucking sandwich, Yuri.

174
00:20:42,791 --> 00:20:44,588
All right, enough.

175
00:20:47,429 --> 00:20:51,456
If any of you fuckers touch him,
you're dead.

176
00:20:52,668 --> 00:20:55,501
So okay, what's happening?

177
00:20:55,671 --> 00:20:58,504
We're gonna give up a hostage.
It will buy us time to think.

178
00:20:58,674 --> 00:21:01,404
Okay. Maybe we should do some work
on them first?

179
00:21:01,576 --> 00:21:04,272
- Let them know we mean business.
- They know we're serious.

180
00:21:04,446 --> 00:21:08,075
- You killed that woman, remember?
- Oh, yes.

181
00:21:13,588 --> 00:21:16,216
Just talked to the police.
We're gonna let one of you go.

182
00:21:16,391 --> 00:21:18,120
Who's it gonna be?

183
00:21:19,695 --> 00:21:22,425
You, come on. Let's go.

184
00:21:25,233 --> 00:21:28,896
Ritchie, Ritchie, let me take him.

185
00:21:29,404 --> 00:21:32,532
Peter, you're just taking him
to the elevator, that's it.

186
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:36,235
Don't talk to him, don't touch him.
Deliver him and come right back.

187
00:21:36,411 --> 00:21:41,246
Yes, I know. I know, but if I see pigs,
I shoot them, yes?

188
00:21:41,416 --> 00:21:43,179
No. Don't shoot anybody, all right?

189
00:21:43,352 --> 00:21:46,617
- Just drop him off and come straight back.
- Yes, I know.

190
00:21:46,788 --> 00:21:50,383
If pigs come out the elevator and are
looking for trouble, I shoot them, yes?

191
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:52,049
You stay here, I'll take him.

192
00:21:52,227 --> 00:21:56,027
No, no, no. It's okay. It's okay.
I've got him. I've got him.

193
00:22:08,577 --> 00:22:09,908
Go.

194
00:22:33,635 --> 00:22:35,193
Now you go.

195
00:22:35,637 --> 00:22:41,803
But remember, if anything goes wrong,
you will be the first to die, hmm?

196
00:22:52,254 --> 00:22:54,347
Press the fucking button, you idiot.

197
00:23:11,106 --> 00:23:13,404
Lucky bastard.

198
00:23:16,912 --> 00:23:19,881
You know, I was going to volunteer
before he did.

199
00:23:20,048 --> 00:23:23,540
I swear to God, he was like
a split-second ahead of me.

200
00:23:24,052 --> 00:23:25,849
They should have let me out first.

201
00:23:26,288 --> 00:23:29,815
If there's anyone here more of a liability
than I am, I'd like to see it.

202
00:23:29,991 --> 00:23:33,757
- I am this close to cracking.
- Why are you telling me this?

203
00:23:33,929 --> 00:23:35,988
Are you trying to make me feel better?

204
00:23:36,898 --> 00:23:40,061
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sure it's going to be okay.

205
00:23:40,802 --> 00:23:43,066
Try to relax.

206
00:23:46,007 --> 00:23:49,204
- I'm Dmitry.
- Anna.

207
00:23:51,446 --> 00:23:52,674
So, what do you do?

208
00:23:53,915 --> 00:23:57,942
- I work for CKL.
- Oh, a secretary.

209
00:23:58,420 --> 00:24:00,081
Junior vice president.

210
00:24:01,156 --> 00:24:05,024
- I meant did you have secretary?
- I have two.

211
00:24:05,660 --> 00:24:07,457
That is nice.

212
00:24:13,969 --> 00:24:18,565
- Do you work here?
- No, I had a meeting with Eurals.

213
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:20,507
I am journalist.

214
00:24:20,675 --> 00:24:23,906
You know those funny stories
at the end of the news?

215
00:24:24,713 --> 00:24:26,943
Really? What channel?

216
00:24:27,782 --> 00:24:31,980
- Well, it's mostly radio so far.
- What station?

217
00:24:32,721 --> 00:24:36,213
Hospitals. Voluntary.

218
00:24:38,593 --> 00:24:39,992
Those three were ahead of me.

219
00:24:40,795 --> 00:24:44,162
Apparently, there is not enough
religious programs on television.

220
00:24:52,374 --> 00:24:54,706
Continue with your prayers.

221
00:25:05,387 --> 00:25:08,618
My name is Sonya. What's your name?

222
00:25:11,126 --> 00:25:12,787
Yuri.

223
00:25:14,829 --> 00:25:16,160
What's wrong, Yuri?

224
00:25:16,698 --> 00:25:20,031
It's Peter. He stole my sandwich.

225
00:25:20,202 --> 00:25:22,796
And he's always calling me
a fucking idiot.

226
00:25:23,238 --> 00:25:25,468
He's the idiot, he can't even read.

227
00:25:26,107 --> 00:25:28,041
Whose blood is that?

228
00:25:29,377 --> 00:25:34,371
It wasn't me.
Peter killed her, but I'll get the blame.

229
00:25:34,816 --> 00:25:40,186
- I don't want to go to prison.
- It's okay, Yuri. I believe you.

230
00:25:40,355 --> 00:25:42,152
God knows it wasn't you.

231
00:25:42,324 --> 00:25:44,656
But that woman, she died for a reason...

232
00:25:44,826 --> 00:25:48,227
...in the same way that we've been
brought together for a reason.

233
00:25:48,396 --> 00:25:52,696
If you let God into your life,
he will take away all your fears.

234
00:25:52,867 --> 00:25:55,529
- Do you want to be free?
- Yes.

235
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:21,887
- Where's the rest of him, Peter?
- It is back there where we came in.

236
00:26:22,764 --> 00:26:25,232
And don't fucking look at me like that.

237
00:26:26,868 --> 00:26:28,335
I did not do it.

238
00:26:28,503 --> 00:26:31,165
- Who did?
- It's obvious.

239
00:26:32,007 --> 00:26:33,907
Fucking pigs. Ha.

240
00:26:34,075 --> 00:26:37,670
- They must not have liked your demands.
- I didn't make any demands, all right?

241
00:26:37,846 --> 00:26:42,249
Do you think I'm fucking stupid?
The police don't kill hostages, you idiot.

242
00:26:42,550 --> 00:26:46,509
- Why? Why did you do it?
- Have you lost your mind?

243
00:26:46,688 --> 00:26:49,748
Listen, I take him to the lift.
The doors open.

244
00:26:49,924 --> 00:26:53,121
Big scissors. Head comes off. Here it is.

245
00:26:55,263 --> 00:26:56,958
Hey... Hey, hey, hey. That is my gun.

246
00:26:57,132 --> 00:27:00,624
You killed that woman upstairs
and now you turn up with a head.

247
00:27:01,069 --> 00:27:02,627
You tell me the truth now.

248
00:27:03,104 --> 00:27:06,904
Look at me. Eh? Look at my hands.

249
00:27:07,509 --> 00:27:11,206
If I'd have cut his head off,
I would have been covered in blood.

250
00:27:11,379 --> 00:27:15,611
If you cut one little nose off, trust me,
there is a hell of a mess.

251
00:27:15,784 --> 00:27:18,150
Ask them. Ask them!

252
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:21,585
And then I want an apology
and my gun back.

253
00:27:21,756 --> 00:27:24,384
You'll get your gun
when we make it out of here.

254
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:26,424
<i>- Can you hear me? Hello.
Yes.</i>

255
00:27:26,594 --> 00:27:29,654
<i>Sorry about what happened
to the man you sent. That was a mistake.</i>

256
00:27:29,831 --> 00:27:31,560
See? Huh. See?

257
00:27:31,733 --> 00:27:34,463
What do you mean a mistake?
You cut his fucking head off.

258
00:27:34,636 --> 00:27:35,796
<i>I know, it was a tragedy.</i>

259
00:27:35,970 --> 00:27:39,667
<i>Still, you do have other hostages,
don't you?</i>

260
00:27:40,008 --> 00:27:42,033
<i>- Yeah.
- Send another one along.</i>

261
00:27:42,210 --> 00:27:46,237
<i>This time a woman.
I'll give you 10 minutes.</i>

262
00:27:46,948 --> 00:27:48,347
So, what they say? Eh?

263
00:27:48,516 --> 00:27:50,609
They want another hostage.
They want a woman.

264
00:27:50,985 --> 00:27:54,148
- Well, you take her.
- No.

265
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:59,390
No. Nobody's taking anyone anywhere.
I wanna check something.

266
00:27:59,561 --> 00:28:01,961
Don't do anything until I come back.

267
00:28:02,697 --> 00:28:04,722
Sit here with my head.

268
00:28:27,489 --> 00:28:28,751
Ah...

269
00:29:54,008 --> 00:29:56,841
Hey. Ha-ha-ha.

270
00:30:15,463 --> 00:30:18,762
- You calmed down?
- As if you care.

271
00:30:26,741 --> 00:30:28,299
Fucking coward.

272
00:30:28,610 --> 00:30:30,635
When are you going to let
the rest of us go?

273
00:30:31,546 --> 00:30:34,071
I would not be in such a hurry to leave
if I was you.

274
00:30:34,916 --> 00:30:37,248
- What do you mean?
- Why shouldn't we be in a hurry?

275
00:30:37,585 --> 00:30:41,180
What is this? Fucking quiz show?

276
00:30:41,356 --> 00:30:44,189
- What happened, happened.
- What happened?

277
00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:48,026
Peter, we got a big problem.

278
00:30:48,196 --> 00:30:50,255
- What did you do to him?
- What?

279
00:30:50,431 --> 00:30:52,695
I'd like to volunteer as the next one
to get out.

280
00:30:52,867 --> 00:30:55,267
Just shut up.
Everybody just shut up, okay?

281
00:30:55,436 --> 00:30:58,928
- Hey, Ritchie, get a grip of yourself.
- Is he all right?

282
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:04,340
Okay, this is my fault.

283
00:31:04,512 --> 00:31:06,844
You want to know what happened
to the young man.

284
00:31:07,382 --> 00:31:08,940
The police, they picked him up.

285
00:31:09,751 --> 00:31:12,948
His last words to me were,
"Tell all of my new friends. "

286
00:31:13,121 --> 00:31:14,315
That's all of you.

287
00:31:14,489 --> 00:31:17,117
"I will meet you in the bar
for a drink later. "

288
00:31:17,292 --> 00:31:19,192
Peter, Peter, outside. Now.

289
00:31:23,031 --> 00:31:27,730
Was it just me or did anyone else
see the head?

290
00:31:33,074 --> 00:31:34,701
I've seen heads.

291
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:41,380
Christ.

292
00:31:43,351 --> 00:31:45,945
I've seen hundreds of them.

293
00:32:00,702 --> 00:32:05,935
Let me introduce myself.
Bogdanovich, Boris.

294
00:32:06,107 --> 00:32:10,168
Serial number 881967.

295
00:32:10,378 --> 00:32:13,108
Ex-Spetsnaz Special Forces.

296
00:32:13,348 --> 00:32:19,617
Combat experience:
Afghanistan, Kosovo, Chechnya.

297
00:32:20,188 --> 00:32:24,591
I am what psychologists would call
alpha male.

298
00:32:26,828 --> 00:32:28,591
I know how these people think.

299
00:32:32,967 --> 00:32:34,958
I am a trained killer myself.

300
00:32:36,871 --> 00:32:38,805
- What?
- I'm a trained killer.

301
00:32:40,108 --> 00:32:44,738
No, seriously, I am. Don't worry.

302
00:32:47,982 --> 00:32:49,813
I know what I am talking about.

303
00:32:50,351 --> 00:32:51,818
<i>Combat Weekly?</i>

304
00:32:51,986 --> 00:32:55,251
I will get us all out of here.

305
00:32:58,092 --> 00:33:01,755
- So this is what, a mummy?
- No, it is not a mummy.

306
00:33:01,929 --> 00:33:04,056
The skin's practically still warm.

307
00:33:04,232 --> 00:33:05,426
Oh.

308
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:09,969
- So who do you think did this?
- Whoever cut the kid's head off, obviously.

309
00:33:12,206 --> 00:33:15,869
God only knows who we been
talking to, but it wasn't the police.

310
00:33:16,044 --> 00:33:19,605
Listen. You hear anything?

311
00:33:19,781 --> 00:33:22,306
There's no sirens.
In a normal hostage situation...

312
00:33:22,483 --> 00:33:25,179
...the whole block would be packed
with emergency services.

313
00:33:25,353 --> 00:33:27,617
It would sound like the Fourth of July
out there.

314
00:33:28,122 --> 00:33:30,750
I don't think this robbery's
even been reported.

315
00:33:31,092 --> 00:33:33,424
So according to you,
the police, the real police...

316
00:33:33,594 --> 00:33:35,061
...they do not know we're here?

317
00:33:35,229 --> 00:33:37,789
No. Maybe. I don't know.

318
00:33:38,433 --> 00:33:40,424
What kind of floor is this anyway?

319
00:33:41,135 --> 00:33:42,830
So things are looking up.

320
00:33:43,004 --> 00:33:45,370
- Look at it, Peter.
- So?

321
00:33:45,540 --> 00:33:46,700
Jesus Christ.

322
00:33:46,874 --> 00:33:48,398
Okay, okay, okay. I understand...

323
00:33:48,576 --> 00:33:51,773
...but things could be a lot worse.

324
00:33:51,979 --> 00:33:55,380
If the police don't know we're here,
all we do is grab Yuri and leave.

325
00:33:55,550 --> 00:33:59,008
- It's that simple, is it?
- What could go wrong? Ha-ha.

326
00:33:59,187 --> 00:34:02,020
What are they going to do?

327
00:34:04,992 --> 00:34:06,289
Are you ready for war?

328
00:34:07,562 --> 00:34:10,895
Dmitry, they're harmless.

329
00:34:12,266 --> 00:34:15,895
Anna, it's possible you have anything
we can use as weapon?

330
00:34:28,916 --> 00:34:33,046
- You best keep hold of that for yourself.
- I will.

331
00:34:34,689 --> 00:34:38,352
The only other thing we could use
is that.

332
00:34:41,963 --> 00:34:43,760
That is enough.

333
00:34:45,767 --> 00:34:47,894
In trained hands...

334
00:34:49,003 --> 00:34:51,096
...a filing cabinet...

335
00:34:52,006 --> 00:34:54,531
...can be more effective than a tank.

336
00:34:54,709 --> 00:34:57,940
- What?
- Wait, Dmitry. Help me, beside door.

337
00:35:01,015 --> 00:35:02,448
On two, up.

338
00:35:05,453 --> 00:35:08,786
Up, Dmitry, up. Good.

339
00:35:10,591 --> 00:35:15,028
Turn round. Turn round, comrade.
Be strong. Be strong.

340
00:35:21,702 --> 00:35:23,329
Yes.

341
00:35:23,805 --> 00:35:24,897
This is plan.

342
00:35:25,306 --> 00:35:29,037
Anna, you bang the door:
Bang, bang, bang.

343
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:33,476
When they open the door, Dmitry and me,
we push filing cabinet on top of leader.

344
00:35:33,648 --> 00:35:38,642
He goes down, we jump second man.
You, you take gun from leader.

345
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:42,119
If you want, kick him in head.

346
00:35:43,157 --> 00:35:46,718
- This is suicide.
- Suicide?

347
00:35:47,195 --> 00:35:48,992
It's better than being murdered, no?

348
00:35:51,065 --> 00:35:53,966
- Yeah.
- The army taught me that.

349
00:35:55,570 --> 00:35:57,037
Good luck.

350
00:36:03,978 --> 00:36:05,502
No!

351
00:36:08,816 --> 00:36:10,078
What are you doing, man?

352
00:36:13,521 --> 00:36:18,083
You make a big mistake trying
to bite me, pal.

353
00:36:18,259 --> 00:36:21,820
Now it's time to pay the price.
Aah...

354
00:36:21,996 --> 00:36:23,258
That's it.

355
00:36:24,232 --> 00:36:25,859
Don't, Peter, don't.

356
00:36:26,033 --> 00:36:27,330
- Why not?
- Just don't.

357
00:36:27,501 --> 00:36:30,299
What, Ritchie, you're animal lover?

358
00:36:31,038 --> 00:36:34,439
- Get that thing away from me, all right?
- Ha-ha-ha.

359
00:36:34,609 --> 00:36:37,942
Aah! Bastard.

360
00:36:41,182 --> 00:36:43,116
Help.
- Yuri's in there.

361
00:36:43,284 --> 00:36:45,275
Open the door!

362
00:36:46,053 --> 00:36:48,749
- Help. Help us.
- Dmitry, don't worry. This is good plan.

363
00:36:48,923 --> 00:36:51,255
We'll probably get away
with 50 percent casualties.

364
00:36:51,425 --> 00:36:53,393
- Open the door.
- But there are three of us.

365
00:36:53,561 --> 00:36:56,553
Help! Please!

366
00:36:57,098 --> 00:36:59,828
Please help us! Help!

367
00:37:01,869 --> 00:37:05,236
Let us out of here, please.

368
00:37:06,741 --> 00:37:09,039
No more Mr. Nice Guy.

369
00:37:10,711 --> 00:37:15,205
Yuri, Yuri, what is all that banging?
I thought you were being cut up.

370
00:37:16,617 --> 00:37:19,484
- What the fuck are you up to?
- It was a trap.

371
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:22,812
They were going to push that on you
when you came in.

372
00:37:23,591 --> 00:37:25,923
You, come here.

373
00:37:32,733 --> 00:37:36,760
Yuri, take this. Change of plan.
We're leaving.

374
00:37:37,138 --> 00:37:39,732
Goodbye, everybody. It's been fun.

375
00:37:40,207 --> 00:37:41,834
- Come on.
Hey, we can't do this.

376
00:37:43,778 --> 00:37:46,042
- What?
- We can't leave.

377
00:37:46,213 --> 00:37:49,182
- Why the fuck not?
- You know why.

378
00:37:49,583 --> 00:37:52,074
What do you care
about these fucking idiots?

379
00:37:52,420 --> 00:37:53,785
What idiots?

380
00:37:53,955 --> 00:37:55,946
We're gonna figure something out,
all right?

381
00:37:56,123 --> 00:37:58,023
I'm a thief. I'm not a murderer.

382
00:37:58,192 --> 00:38:00,752
- Listen, you stay, I'm going.
- Can I see that?

383
00:38:00,928 --> 00:38:02,953
You're not going
until we figure this out.

384
00:38:03,130 --> 00:38:08,659
- You going to stop me, Ritchie? Huh?
- Lf I have to, yeah.

385
00:38:19,313 --> 00:38:20,712
Come on, come...

386
00:38:34,228 --> 00:38:36,958
What the fuck are you looking at?

387
00:38:38,399 --> 00:38:40,731
Fucking idiot, Yuri.

388
00:38:41,969 --> 00:38:43,561
Drop it.

389
00:38:44,472 --> 00:38:46,303
Drop it.

390
00:38:47,308 --> 00:38:51,745
Katerina, get the gun.
Helena, get the bag and the shotgun.

391
00:38:55,583 --> 00:38:57,050
Do not be afraid.

392
00:38:57,218 --> 00:38:59,812
This is all part of the Almighty's plan.

393
00:38:59,987 --> 00:39:01,614
- I'll call the police.
- Get back.

394
00:39:01,789 --> 00:39:03,484
- The Almighty's in charge now.
- But...

395
00:39:03,657 --> 00:39:06,182
- Get back in here, you whore.
- Okay, lady, listen...

396
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:08,328
Speak again
and I'll shoot you in the head.

397
00:39:08,496 --> 00:39:10,623
Yuri, get that walkie-talkie.

398
00:39:11,999 --> 00:39:15,628
Let us thank the Almighty
for delivering us from this evil.

399
00:39:15,803 --> 00:39:17,998
On your knees.

400
00:39:24,612 --> 00:39:25,704
YURl:
What was that?

401
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:29,145
That's what I was trying to tell...
Jesus Christ.

402
00:39:29,316 --> 00:39:30,977
I told you to be quiet.

403
00:39:32,286 --> 00:39:33,753
Let's go.

404
00:39:36,891 --> 00:39:38,825
Try anything
and you will be slaughtered.

405
00:39:41,062 --> 00:39:44,657
Can't believe this. Fucking Russia.

406
00:40:07,188 --> 00:40:09,622
- Sonya.
- Do not be afraid.

407
00:40:09,790 --> 00:40:12,850
- But it came from down there.
- Stay here.

408
00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:16,195
Don't go.
You don't know what's down there.

409
00:40:16,363 --> 00:40:20,959
I have no fear.
The Almighty will protect me.

410
00:40:51,198 --> 00:40:55,157
I was really impressed with the way
you performed our operation.

411
00:40:55,436 --> 00:40:59,566
Unlike some,
you acted with great courage.

412
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:02,201
If we make it out of here...

413
00:41:03,677 --> 00:41:05,702
...I'd really like to take you for drink.

414
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:06,904
What?

415
00:41:08,382 --> 00:41:11,874
No, I was just saying...

416
00:41:12,052 --> 00:41:14,612
...if we don't all end up dead...

417
00:41:14,855 --> 00:41:16,447
...maybe we could go for drink.

418
00:41:16,624 --> 00:41:20,219
- As a group?
- Just you and me.

419
00:41:22,763 --> 00:41:24,230
No.

420
00:41:30,404 --> 00:41:32,395
No, don't.

421
00:41:32,573 --> 00:41:35,872
From now on, I don't want nothing
to do with you, Dmitry.

422
00:41:36,043 --> 00:41:40,412
- You... You deserter, you.
- I'm sorry, okay?

423
00:41:41,248 --> 00:41:42,681
I was scared.

424
00:41:43,217 --> 00:41:46,584
I know you'll think I'm not a real man
for saying this...

425
00:41:46,754 --> 00:41:50,246
...but I don't like violence. I never have.

426
00:41:50,424 --> 00:41:52,187
I can't say I understand you.

427
00:41:53,561 --> 00:41:57,088
Fear, being frightened, afraidness...

428
00:41:57,264 --> 00:42:00,256
...these words are not part
of Boris' vocabulary.

429
00:42:00,434 --> 00:42:03,767
I am an alpha male,
but then I can't blame you.

430
00:42:03,938 --> 00:42:06,805
I suppose I did spend 15 years in army.

431
00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:11,908
It was the time of my life.

432
00:42:12,279 --> 00:42:15,146
It's not like you journalists say,
that it's just bullying...

433
00:42:15,316 --> 00:42:17,113
...cannibalism and homosexual rape.

434
00:42:18,919 --> 00:42:21,547
The sense of camaraderie
is unbelievable.

435
00:42:21,889 --> 00:42:25,325
Imagine being a part of the biggest family
in the whole world.

436
00:42:25,793 --> 00:42:28,421
That's what being in the army was like.

437
00:42:29,163 --> 00:42:33,896
I'm not ashamed to say that I loved every
single man in my regiment.

438
00:42:35,703 --> 00:42:37,568
And why did you leave?

439
00:42:38,239 --> 00:42:42,403
I was accused of bullying, cannibalism
and homosexual rape.

440
00:42:42,576 --> 00:42:44,407
I did not do it, of course, Dmitry.

441
00:42:44,578 --> 00:42:47,172
Them bastards in my regiment
set me up.

442
00:42:51,218 --> 00:42:52,685
Not so tough now, are we?

443
00:42:53,821 --> 00:42:55,379
What?

444
00:43:00,594 --> 00:43:03,586
One more step and I'll break you in two.

445
00:43:11,138 --> 00:43:13,129
He knows who's boss.

446
00:43:22,616 --> 00:43:25,551
- What was making that noise?
- There is nothing to fear.

447
00:43:25,719 --> 00:43:27,619
This is a sacred place.

448
00:43:28,589 --> 00:43:30,887
I know what the Almighty
wants us to do.

449
00:43:32,126 --> 00:43:36,961
- And that would be...?
- It's time to make a sacrifice.

450
00:43:43,137 --> 00:43:44,434
Well...

451
00:43:44,605 --> 00:43:47,506
...looks like we're all
in the same boat here.

452
00:43:48,542 --> 00:43:51,375
And if we wanna make it out of here,
we better make a truce.

453
00:43:51,545 --> 00:43:54,776
For what it's worth, it was never
part of the plan to take hostages.

454
00:43:54,948 --> 00:43:57,883
- I'm sorry.
- We know what you did.

455
00:43:58,052 --> 00:44:02,489
- Why did you cut his head off?
- I didn't cut anybody's head off.

456
00:44:02,656 --> 00:44:03,748
Neither did he.

457
00:44:04,558 --> 00:44:07,823
There's someone else here, guys, all right?
We're not alone here.

458
00:44:07,995 --> 00:44:11,658
I don't know who it is, but he's the guy
who cut the kid's head off.

459
00:44:11,999 --> 00:44:14,968
My advice is get good lawyer.
Because when the police come...

460
00:44:15,135 --> 00:44:18,730
The police aren't coming.
The police don't even know we're here.

461
00:44:18,906 --> 00:44:20,498
Frankly, I wish they did.

462
00:44:20,674 --> 00:44:24,667
Now, whoever killed that kid,
he stopped the lift as well.

463
00:44:24,845 --> 00:44:27,405
He pretended to be the police
so we'd send a hostage.

464
00:44:27,581 --> 00:44:29,913
And, well, you know what happened.

465
00:44:30,784 --> 00:44:32,479
You're a security guard, right?

466
00:44:33,087 --> 00:44:36,352
- Yes.
- You've seen this floor before?

467
00:44:42,496 --> 00:44:43,963
Who wants to be saved first?

468
00:44:44,131 --> 00:44:46,964
What exactly do you mean
by being saved?

469
00:44:47,134 --> 00:44:48,294
You, get up.

470
00:44:54,341 --> 00:44:55,501
Mm-mm.

471
00:45:13,660 --> 00:45:16,185
Katerina, get the chair.

472
00:45:25,873 --> 00:45:27,306
Sit.

473
00:45:31,311 --> 00:45:36,715
- Please. You don't have to do this.
- Yuri, tie him up.

474
00:46:12,052 --> 00:46:13,451
Get away from the door.

475
00:46:17,024 --> 00:46:21,290
There's only one of them.
She's scared, just talk to her.

476
00:46:29,736 --> 00:46:34,571
Look, I don't know what's going on
but I just want to go home.

477
00:46:35,576 --> 00:46:38,875
- Why don't you open the door?
- I can't.

478
00:46:39,746 --> 00:46:43,273
Sonya told me to stay here
and not let you escape.

479
00:46:46,954 --> 00:46:50,253
But you know I've not done
anything wrong.

480
00:46:51,658 --> 00:46:54,252
This whole thing is a job for the police.

481
00:46:54,428 --> 00:46:57,056
Let us out
and we can call them together.

482
00:46:58,131 --> 00:47:00,292
But I'm just so scared.

483
00:47:01,134 --> 00:47:04,900
I'm scared too,
but this can all be over soon.

484
00:47:05,772 --> 00:47:07,637
Open the door.

485
00:47:10,344 --> 00:47:12,744
You promise to call the police?

486
00:47:14,248 --> 00:47:15,613
I promise.

487
00:47:16,850 --> 00:47:19,341
Everything's going to be okay.

488
00:48:02,062 --> 00:48:03,461
What?

489
00:48:04,131 --> 00:48:07,066
You know how to use a shotgun?
Take it.

490
00:48:07,935 --> 00:48:08,959
No.

491
00:48:09,136 --> 00:48:11,900
The reason I've got it
is because I'm the only one who does.

492
00:48:12,072 --> 00:48:13,903
I know how to use it.

493
00:48:14,841 --> 00:48:17,309
Yeah. Come on.

494
00:48:59,720 --> 00:49:03,679
Dmitry, don't move.
I get the ropes off you.

495
00:49:04,491 --> 00:49:06,823
One, two...

496
00:49:11,365 --> 00:49:12,855
Dmitry?

497
00:49:14,568 --> 00:49:17,731
- What is it?
- There are no buttons.

498
00:49:18,972 --> 00:49:20,963
What was that?

499
00:49:22,709 --> 00:49:24,768
We can't call the lift.
There are no buttons.

500
00:49:24,945 --> 00:49:27,709
We're stuck here? Jesus Christ.
If we can't call the lift...

501
00:49:27,881 --> 00:49:30,213
...we're as good as dead.
- Just relax, relax.

502
00:49:30,384 --> 00:49:33,251
I can still get us out of here.
I gotta get this panel off.

503
00:49:33,420 --> 00:49:35,911
I'll short the system
and it will call the lift.

504
00:49:38,225 --> 00:49:39,715
That's it. We're all going to die.

505
00:49:39,893 --> 00:49:44,227
We're going to be hunted down like animals
and killed one by one.

506
00:49:44,398 --> 00:49:46,889
I mean, think about it.
What if he's a sex criminal?

507
00:49:47,067 --> 00:49:50,161
Dmitry, you are becoming hysterical.
I am now going to slap you.

508
00:49:50,337 --> 00:49:52,737
That's enough.
Nobody's getting slapped.

509
00:49:52,906 --> 00:49:55,500
We're all going to die
and he wants to slap me.

510
00:49:55,842 --> 00:49:59,869
- That's not fair.
- Where are you going?

511
00:50:00,047 --> 00:50:02,845
I'm gonna find a way to raise that thing
and get out of here.

512
00:50:03,016 --> 00:50:04,278
You coming?

513
00:50:12,225 --> 00:50:16,161
- Sonya?
- I didn't give you permission to speak.

514
00:50:20,267 --> 00:50:22,201
I need to see Helena.

515
00:50:43,990 --> 00:50:45,958
Room cleared and secured.

516
00:50:54,835 --> 00:50:57,030
No, Katerina. Stay.

517
00:50:57,904 --> 00:50:59,838
Helena, what happened?

518
00:51:03,310 --> 00:51:08,680
- Answer me. What happened?
- I'm sorry. I was going to let them out.

519
00:51:09,316 --> 00:51:11,045
Please.

520
00:51:11,485 --> 00:51:13,715
- I'm sorry.
- Come.

521
00:51:14,654 --> 00:51:16,918
Yuri. Aah...

522
00:51:31,338 --> 00:51:32,396
Get away from the door.

523
00:51:38,411 --> 00:51:40,538
Aah!
Come on.

524
00:51:41,815 --> 00:51:43,248
Aah!

525
00:51:45,385 --> 00:51:47,250
He's been shot. We've got to leave him.

526
00:51:47,454 --> 00:51:50,355
I haven't been shot, you idiot.
It's a cramp.

527
00:51:52,559 --> 00:51:55,255
- I'll stay.
- To hell with you.

528
00:52:20,020 --> 00:52:26,516
Boris, you have made fool of yourself.
Never leave man down.

529
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:29,622
I can't believe you forgot that.

530
00:52:33,099 --> 00:52:34,930
Shh.

531
00:52:35,535 --> 00:52:37,366
Do you have anything for a weapon?

532
00:52:37,537 --> 00:52:39,095
I have a nail file.

533
00:52:39,272 --> 00:52:40,933
Great.

534
00:52:46,313 --> 00:52:47,974
Don't worry. Boris is back.

535
00:52:48,148 --> 00:52:50,776
Shh. Shut up.
- No, no, no. I'm ready to fight.

536
00:52:50,951 --> 00:52:54,478
- Point me in dire... Mm...
Just shut it.

537
00:52:55,555 --> 00:53:00,185
Yeah. It's a dud. Shit.

538
00:53:00,360 --> 00:53:04,126
- There's one round between us all.
- Where's Dmitry?

539
00:53:05,632 --> 00:53:10,228
Can anybody hear me?
Can anybody hear me?

540
00:53:10,403 --> 00:53:12,928
<i>Greetings, comrade.
- Oh, thank God.</i>

541
00:53:13,773 --> 00:53:17,504
You have to get the police.
Various people are trying to kill me.

542
00:53:17,677 --> 00:53:19,941
<i>What is your handle?</i>

543
00:53:20,113 --> 00:53:21,137
Huh?

544
00:53:21,314 --> 00:53:25,182
<i>- I said, what is your handle?
- I don't have a handle.</i>

545
00:53:25,652 --> 00:53:28,849
<i>- I don't have a handle.
- Oh, you've got to have handle.</i>

546
00:53:29,222 --> 00:53:31,520
<i>- Mine is...
- I don't want to know your handle.</i>

547
00:53:31,691 --> 00:53:32,988
Just listen.

548
00:53:33,159 --> 00:53:35,684
I got on this lift,
and you're probably thinking:

549
00:53:35,862 --> 00:53:38,626
"Normal passengers.
Ground floor, please. " No.

550
00:53:38,965 --> 00:53:42,025
Three of them had done a robbery
and the rest of us were hostages.

551
00:53:42,202 --> 00:53:43,726
Things have changed since then.

552
00:53:43,904 --> 00:53:48,739
Some of the hostages have taken over.
Yeah, they tried to sacrifice me.

553
00:53:48,909 --> 00:53:50,740
Come back, robbers, all is forgiven.

554
00:53:50,911 --> 00:53:55,211
And before I forget, there's also this
psycho, definite-sex-criminal nut job...

555
00:53:55,382 --> 00:53:57,714
...running around
cutting people's heads off.

556
00:53:57,884 --> 00:54:01,650
I haven't had the chance to talk to him yet,
but I'm sure I will later.

557
00:54:02,989 --> 00:54:06,186
<i>- Do you want to know what my handle is?
- What?</i>

558
00:54:06,359 --> 00:54:08,190
Didn't you hear a word I just said?

559
00:54:08,862 --> 00:54:11,956
<i>Oh, if you don't want to know,
I'll tell you anyway.</i>

560
00:54:12,132 --> 00:54:16,068
<i>- My handle is "Ferret. "
- Oh...</i>

561
00:54:16,236 --> 00:54:19,672
Listen, you weirdo.
Just phone the police.

562
00:54:21,908 --> 00:54:23,500
Hello?

563
00:54:25,312 --> 00:54:26,939
Ferret?

564
00:54:59,646 --> 00:55:00,874
Are you okay?

565
00:55:01,915 --> 00:55:06,477
- Dmitry, where are your trousers?
- Where I left them.

566
00:55:17,998 --> 00:55:21,161
That was me.
Just give me a second.

567
00:55:54,734 --> 00:55:57,828
Anna, you look closely,
you see blood on hook.

568
00:55:58,004 --> 00:56:00,438
I'm really glad you told me that.

569
00:56:09,049 --> 00:56:11,540
Dmitry, you hungry?

570
00:56:16,623 --> 00:56:18,454
Look at that.

571
00:56:20,994 --> 00:56:22,985
Is that what I think it is?

572
00:56:29,436 --> 00:56:32,200
Dmitry, give me hand, please.

573
00:56:34,407 --> 00:56:36,307
"Chosen by God...

574
00:56:36,676 --> 00:56:40,737
...first czar of all the Russias,
defender of the one true faith...

575
00:56:41,014 --> 00:56:43,175
...and scourge of nonbelievers.

576
00:56:44,651 --> 00:56:46,812
Ivan the Terrible. "

577
00:57:06,706 --> 00:57:10,506
- And the Almighty can do anything?
- Yes. The Almighty is all-powerful.

578
00:57:10,677 --> 00:57:14,408
- And he can't die?
- Yes, Yuri, the Almighty is immortal.

579
00:57:14,581 --> 00:57:17,049
So that means he can't kill himself.

580
00:57:19,319 --> 00:57:21,844
Because if he can't kill himself...

581
00:57:22,021 --> 00:57:26,890
...then that means he's not all-powerful,
doesn't it?

582
00:57:30,130 --> 00:57:32,690
- Why don't we go and ask him?
- Oh.

583
00:57:34,567 --> 00:57:37,536
- I suppose we could.
- Yes. Let's do it now.

584
00:57:38,638 --> 00:57:42,130
- You stay and pray.
- But I want to meet the Almighty too.

585
00:57:42,308 --> 00:57:45,209
Be patient. Your time will come.

586
00:57:48,515 --> 00:57:50,210
Bye-bye.

587
00:57:51,117 --> 00:57:52,550
Look.

588
00:57:52,719 --> 00:57:56,052
"This cross is a symbol
of Ivan's almighty power...

589
00:57:56,222 --> 00:57:58,816
...and it will pass down
through the generations...

590
00:57:58,992 --> 00:58:02,519
...until there comes a time
when he will be made flesh again...

591
00:58:02,695 --> 00:58:05,095
...and save the souls of all.

592
00:58:05,465 --> 00:58:07,296
That time has come. "

593
00:58:10,403 --> 00:58:11,893
Hey.

594
00:58:12,505 --> 00:58:14,166
Remind you of anyone?

595
00:58:43,169 --> 00:58:46,627
Are you God?

596
00:58:48,775 --> 00:58:49,833
No.

597
00:58:51,144 --> 00:58:53,203
I am the devil!

598
00:59:48,268 --> 00:59:50,429
Peter!

599
00:59:58,144 --> 00:59:59,839
So let me get this straight.

600
01:00:00,013 --> 01:00:05,110
That witch with the Bible
is related to a wannabe Ivan the Terrible?

601
01:00:05,285 --> 01:00:08,777
- Yes.
- And they chop people up on this floor?

602
01:00:08,955 --> 01:00:10,582
You saw the fridge, right?

603
01:00:10,757 --> 01:00:14,420
They got a system here rigged above
and beyond what the normal security is.

604
01:00:14,861 --> 01:00:18,092
I mean, they must control the elevators,
the cameras, everything.

605
01:00:18,264 --> 01:00:22,223
- But how can they do this?
- Because they own the building.

606
01:00:25,605 --> 01:00:29,974
- They're the ones I ripped off.
- What did you steal?

607
01:00:31,611 --> 01:00:33,272
The cross.

608
01:00:34,480 --> 01:00:36,380
Ha-ha-ha. That's perfect.

609
01:00:36,549 --> 01:00:42,283
You stole a sacred relic from the insane
descendants of Ivan the Terrible.

610
01:00:42,922 --> 01:00:46,756
Give me the bag.
Give me the bag, I make drop-off.

611
01:00:46,926 --> 01:00:49,486
- What drop-off?
- It's simple.

612
01:00:49,662 --> 01:00:53,928
I return the cross, they let us go.
Therefore, the bag.

613
01:00:54,801 --> 01:00:56,393
Are you not hearing what we said?

614
01:00:56,569 --> 01:00:59,595
They're psycho twins.
They're not gonna let any of us leave...

615
01:00:59,772 --> 01:01:02,741
...with or without the cross.
- But I have negotiation skills.

616
01:01:02,909 --> 01:01:04,570
Now give me the bag.

617
01:01:13,419 --> 01:01:17,617
- It's beautiful.
- It's not the cross, you idiot.

618
01:01:18,658 --> 01:01:20,956
Peter, you stupid bastard.

619
01:01:21,561 --> 01:01:25,520
Bullshit. Bullshit. That's it.

620
01:01:25,698 --> 01:01:28,690
Enough is enough is enough.
I'm bloody sick of it.

621
01:01:29,035 --> 01:01:32,937
That fucker tried to put a 6-foot spear
through my scrotum...

622
01:01:33,473 --> 01:01:36,101
...and that is not something
I'm gonna forget in a hurry.

623
01:01:36,476 --> 01:01:37,841
Now come on, everybody.

624
01:01:38,311 --> 01:01:40,802
- Let's go do the bastard!
- You are right, Dmitry.

625
01:01:40,980 --> 01:01:44,677
It is time to make a stand and fight.
We are Russian.

626
01:02:01,100 --> 01:02:03,091
That's it. Quickly.

627
01:02:03,669 --> 01:02:05,569
Put him on the altar.

628
01:02:10,076 --> 01:02:13,102
Not like that. The other way.

629
01:02:26,192 --> 01:02:30,526
Almighty, accept this sacrifice
from your humble servant.

630
01:02:31,130 --> 01:02:35,760
Forgive my younger brother's foolishness.
He knows not what he does.

631
01:02:35,935 --> 01:02:38,096
What are you doing?

632
01:02:38,438 --> 01:02:41,737
To think I was speaking to the Almighty
on your behalf!

633
01:02:41,908 --> 01:02:46,106
You do too much speaking. I killed him.
I should be able to do whatever I like.

634
01:02:46,279 --> 01:02:48,713
If it was not for me,
you would be nothing.

635
01:02:48,881 --> 01:02:50,212
- But I skin...
- But nothing.

636
01:02:50,383 --> 01:02:52,044
- Apologize now!
- But I...

637
01:02:52,218 --> 01:02:53,549
Say you're sorry!

638
01:03:01,093 --> 01:03:02,788
Sorry.

639
01:03:05,631 --> 01:03:09,032
It doesn't matter anymore.
You ruined this one.

640
01:03:09,202 --> 01:03:10,794
Get me another one.

641
01:03:15,775 --> 01:03:18,403
So, Dmitry, you ever thought about
career in army?

642
01:03:18,578 --> 01:03:22,105
I don't know. Is there an accelerated
promotion scheme for graduates?

643
01:03:27,720 --> 01:03:29,620
Are we leaving?

644
01:03:32,558 --> 01:03:34,549
- Yeah. I gotta get that cross.
- Ritchie...

645
01:03:34,727 --> 01:03:38,754
Look. I'm not gonna argue with you
about it. I'm sorry.

646
01:03:40,132 --> 01:03:41,258
Are you coming?

647
01:03:41,801 --> 01:03:46,238
- It's better if we stick together.
- Me and Dmitry have our own plans.

648
01:03:46,405 --> 01:03:48,396
Time to make our declaration of war.

649
01:03:48,808 --> 01:03:51,936
And we shall start here with this room.

650
01:03:53,913 --> 01:03:55,676
Good luck, guys.

651
01:03:56,315 --> 01:03:57,873
Good luck, Anna.

652
01:04:01,954 --> 01:04:03,421
Wait.

653
01:04:03,689 --> 01:04:06,021
Just gotta figure out
which is the right way.

654
01:04:06,192 --> 01:04:09,787
- Oh, it's not cramp, then.
- No.

655
01:04:10,429 --> 01:04:11,919
Thanks for staying with me.

656
01:04:12,098 --> 01:04:14,623
What was I going to do?
Run away with Boris?

657
01:04:16,335 --> 01:04:19,793
Look, I'm sorry I got you involved
in all this.

658
01:04:20,473 --> 01:04:23,465
Since I came back to Russia,
things haven't gone exactly to plan.

659
01:04:23,643 --> 01:04:26,612
It's time for a new plan.
We stick together...

660
01:04:26,779 --> 01:04:30,340
...we get out of here alive. Deal?

661
01:04:30,683 --> 01:04:32,310
Deal.

662
01:04:32,485 --> 01:04:35,283
- This way.
- No, it's that way.

663
01:04:36,022 --> 01:04:38,081
No, we're going back
to where Peter was shot.

664
01:04:38,257 --> 01:04:41,283
I know, that's why we should
go this way.

665
01:04:42,361 --> 01:04:44,659
Are you sure?
I think that's doubling back around.

666
01:04:44,830 --> 01:04:46,695
No, it's not.

667
01:04:46,999 --> 01:04:50,332
Look, you've made enough
bad choices for one day.

668
01:04:51,304 --> 01:04:52,635
Okay.

669
01:05:37,116 --> 01:05:38,743
Ritchie.

670
01:05:42,188 --> 01:05:44,088
- It's stuck.
- All right. Hold on. Hold on.

671
01:05:44,256 --> 01:05:46,451
I can't pull it out.

672
01:05:48,861 --> 01:05:52,592
That son of a bitch. Okay.

673
01:05:54,500 --> 01:05:58,061
All right, it's gone through your ear
and it's opened up inside the wall.

674
01:05:58,237 --> 01:05:59,966
I'm not gonna be able to pull it out.

675
01:06:01,140 --> 01:06:02,402
What can we do?

676
01:06:04,644 --> 01:06:07,238
Okay, everything's gonna be okay.

677
01:06:07,413 --> 01:06:10,109
I'm not going anywhere,
but we can't stay here.

678
01:06:10,282 --> 01:06:12,842
You're gonna need to move your head
as quick as you can.

679
01:06:13,019 --> 01:06:15,283
- Get it over and done as fast as possible.
- What?

680
01:06:16,288 --> 01:06:19,451
- Do you understand me?
- You want me to tear half my ear off?

681
01:06:19,625 --> 01:06:22,560
- Oh, I can't.
- Yes, you can.

682
01:06:23,963 --> 01:06:25,760
Try for me.

683
01:06:29,669 --> 01:06:33,503
- I can't do it. I can't do it.
- Okay, fine. Shh, shh, shh.

684
01:06:33,806 --> 01:06:36,297
All right. Hey. Hey. Hey. Relax.

685
01:06:36,842 --> 01:06:38,935
Tell me about your favorite vacation.

686
01:06:39,111 --> 01:06:41,944
- What?
- Talk to me, okay?

687
01:06:44,016 --> 01:06:45,847
I don't know.

688
01:06:46,285 --> 01:06:51,313
- I suppose it would have to be Sochi.
- Sochi, yeah?

689
01:06:51,757 --> 01:06:57,024
- What's so good about that place?
- It's just really perfect.

690
01:06:58,497 --> 01:06:59,930
- I'm sorry.
- Aah!

691
01:07:03,903 --> 01:07:05,530
This will do.

692
01:07:54,019 --> 01:07:55,680
We didn't have much time.

693
01:07:58,124 --> 01:08:02,322
Considering everything, we did very well.

694
01:08:02,528 --> 01:08:06,089
- Think it will work?
- Of course, Dmitry.

695
01:08:06,265 --> 01:08:07,823
I mean...

696
01:08:08,634 --> 01:08:10,568
Do you think so?

697
01:08:11,203 --> 01:08:13,763
One hundred percent positive.

698
01:08:15,207 --> 01:08:16,697
Me too.

699
01:08:52,578 --> 01:08:54,239
Bastards!

700
01:09:06,759 --> 01:09:08,784
We're never going to get out of here.

701
01:09:08,961 --> 01:09:11,953
Nobody ever gets out of here.
Why should we be any different?

702
01:09:12,131 --> 01:09:16,261
Because we're different now.
Because we're together, we're a team.

703
01:09:16,468 --> 01:09:20,199
Come on, I need you to be as strong as
you already proved you were back there.

704
01:09:21,073 --> 01:09:24,304
Look, Anna, you gotta trust me.

705
01:09:24,476 --> 01:09:27,445
There's no way in hell
I'm letting either one of us die.

706
01:09:27,613 --> 01:09:30,741
We made a deal
to get out of here alive, right?

707
01:09:31,183 --> 01:09:33,310
I'm not in the business
of breaking my word.

708
01:09:45,097 --> 01:09:48,533
Did your mama never tell you
to keep your room tidy?

709
01:09:50,269 --> 01:09:53,363
I had him. Goddamn it.

710
01:09:55,441 --> 01:09:56,908
Fuck.

711
01:10:06,518 --> 01:10:08,918
He's been watching us the whole time.

712
01:10:11,323 --> 01:10:12,950
Hold this.

713
01:10:41,353 --> 01:10:42,820
Dmitry.

714
01:11:25,464 --> 01:11:27,022
Come on.

715
01:11:34,740 --> 01:11:36,537
Oh, no.

716
01:11:47,786 --> 01:11:49,583
Boris?

717
01:11:51,123 --> 01:11:52,249
Oh, fuck.

718
01:11:56,462 --> 01:11:58,293
Oh, fuck.

719
01:12:00,232 --> 01:12:02,496
I should have been an accountant.

720
01:12:04,136 --> 01:12:05,433
Oh, fuck.

721
01:12:34,967 --> 01:12:37,993
- My head.
- On your feet.

722
01:12:43,142 --> 01:12:45,804
Can't you do this any faster?

723
01:12:51,850 --> 01:12:52,874
Here we go.

724
01:12:55,087 --> 01:12:56,577
Yes.

725
01:13:01,527 --> 01:13:04,963
- What are we waiting for?
- Just give me one sec.

726
01:13:07,766 --> 01:13:11,327
Now we get the cross
and get the hell out of here.

727
01:13:30,956 --> 01:13:36,417
That's it. It's gone.
It's time to go.

728
01:13:36,628 --> 01:13:39,188
- I can't.
- It's gone, Ritchie.

729
01:13:39,364 --> 01:13:42,231
- It's time to go.
- I'm not leaving without it.

730
01:13:42,401 --> 01:13:44,665
If you stay here, you're going to die.

731
01:13:44,837 --> 01:13:48,068
And if I leave without the cross,
I'm dead anyway.

732
01:13:48,240 --> 01:13:52,609
Anna, you gotta understand
there's people outside waiting for me.

733
01:13:52,778 --> 01:13:56,714
If I don't give them what they want,
they're gonna kill me. I need that cross.

734
01:13:57,282 --> 01:13:59,182
So, what now?

735
01:14:00,786 --> 01:14:03,050
We go and we find it.

736
01:14:05,224 --> 01:14:06,657
Come on.

737
01:14:33,118 --> 01:14:35,882
<i>Where the fuck
do you think you're going?</i>

738
01:14:36,054 --> 01:14:38,545
<i>Get back in here now.</i>

739
01:14:44,229 --> 01:14:48,222
<i>I said get the fuck back in here now!</i>

740
01:14:53,438 --> 01:14:55,269
Tie him up.

741
01:15:01,747 --> 01:15:03,180
What's that for?

742
01:15:03,348 --> 01:15:07,182
This will freeze the muscles on your face.
It'll make it easier to skin you.

743
01:15:07,352 --> 01:15:09,650
I must warn you I have allergies.

744
01:15:09,821 --> 01:15:14,349
No one will be spared
for the glory of the Almighty.

745
01:15:15,694 --> 01:15:17,787
- This one's mine.
- No.

746
01:15:17,963 --> 01:15:20,864
That's not the way we do it. I kill them.
I always kill them.

747
01:15:21,033 --> 01:15:24,525
Stay where you are. I told you, he's mine.
Stay and watch if you want.

748
01:15:24,703 --> 01:15:27,934
You can have the next one,
just let me kill him.

749
01:15:28,106 --> 01:15:31,303
- No.
- But I did this for you.

750
01:15:31,710 --> 01:15:36,306
- Please, let me kill him.
- I don't want that. You disgust me.

751
01:15:38,383 --> 01:15:39,680
- Aah!
- Get out!

752
01:15:39,851 --> 01:15:42,251
- But I want...
- Get out!

753
01:15:44,456 --> 01:15:46,549
You are an animal! That is all you are.

754
01:15:46,725 --> 01:15:49,387
I am the eldest. You do what I say.
Now go!

755
01:15:49,561 --> 01:15:51,153
Ten seconds. That's all.

756
01:15:51,330 --> 01:15:54,197
If I was born 10 seconds before you,
then I'd be in charge.

757
01:15:54,366 --> 01:15:56,561
Well, you weren't, were you? I was.
Now get out!

758
01:15:59,238 --> 01:16:00,227
Ooh!

759
01:16:00,405 --> 01:16:02,373
- Sonya, what's going on?
- What?

760
01:16:03,041 --> 01:16:05,532
- Do you know him?
- Oh, shut up.

761
01:16:58,563 --> 01:17:00,929
<i>You're fucking dead!</i>

762
01:17:11,443 --> 01:17:14,776
<i>Get up. Get up.</i>

763
01:17:15,080 --> 01:17:18,811
<i>Pussy. Get up!</i>

764
01:17:32,064 --> 01:17:34,897
You're fucking dead!

765
01:17:43,942 --> 01:17:45,239
Shh.

766
01:18:02,461 --> 01:18:05,760
- Huh...
- Shh.

767
01:18:41,733 --> 01:18:43,428
Let's go.

768
01:18:52,811 --> 01:18:54,642
Where is it?

769
01:18:54,946 --> 01:18:58,473
You son of a bitch. If you weren't dead,
I'd fucking kill you myself.

770
01:18:59,317 --> 01:19:01,751
- This isn't helping.
- Fucking stabbed me.

771
01:19:05,724 --> 01:19:07,521
Jesus.

772
01:19:13,298 --> 01:19:15,994
Ritchie, what are you doing down there?

773
01:19:16,868 --> 01:19:18,836
I've been looking for that.

774
01:19:23,208 --> 01:19:24,971
Where's Yuri?

775
01:19:26,545 --> 01:19:29,571
- I said, where's Yuri?
- He's over there behind the curtain.

776
01:19:29,948 --> 01:19:33,349
- What's he doing behind there?
- He's dead.

777
01:19:36,087 --> 01:19:37,418
It's okay.

778
01:19:38,457 --> 01:19:40,652
Ritchie, keep still.

779
01:19:43,428 --> 01:19:46,226
Don't... Put pressure on this.
It's okay.

780
01:19:47,365 --> 01:19:51,495
- Who did this?
Ivan the Terrible killed him.

781
01:19:55,774 --> 01:19:58,868
- And where is he?
- I don't know. He just left.

782
01:19:59,211 --> 01:20:00,701
Okay.

783
01:20:05,417 --> 01:20:07,112
Where are you taking us?

784
01:20:09,154 --> 01:20:11,213
You're lost, aren't you?

785
01:20:11,423 --> 01:20:13,550
You realize you will die here,
you stupid im...

786
01:20:18,930 --> 01:20:20,158
You.

787
01:20:26,738 --> 01:20:30,765
Please, listen to me.
I don't know what's going on.

788
01:20:30,942 --> 01:20:35,003
I was lonely
and she said she would help me...

789
01:20:35,180 --> 01:20:39,048
...and I don't want to die here.
Please. Please.

790
01:20:42,254 --> 01:20:43,482
Close the door.

791
01:20:46,525 --> 01:20:49,255
There's a draft. Close the door.

792
01:20:50,762 --> 01:20:51,854
Please.

793
01:21:12,317 --> 01:21:15,286
Come back here
with my fucking hand, you bitch!

794
01:21:50,488 --> 01:21:52,183
You bastards.

795
01:22:09,641 --> 01:22:11,666
Spetsnaz.

796
01:22:24,189 --> 01:22:27,420
I'm a reasonable man,
but this is getting out of hand.

797
01:22:28,760 --> 01:22:30,625
I'm gonna get my cross...

798
01:22:30,795 --> 01:22:34,595
...I'm gonna get the hell out of this damn
country, and I'm never coming back.

799
01:22:45,477 --> 01:22:47,809
Where the hell are you?

800
01:22:47,979 --> 01:22:50,004
I'm alpha male.

801
01:22:53,885 --> 01:22:55,853
I'm alpha male.

802
01:22:56,021 --> 01:22:59,286
Alpha male. Alpha male.

803
01:23:18,510 --> 01:23:21,001
Hey. Ha-ha-ha.

804
01:23:21,179 --> 01:23:26,481
Over here. Come on.
Yes, I'm talking to you.

805
01:23:26,651 --> 01:23:29,779
- You motherfucker!
Hey.

806
01:23:30,155 --> 01:23:32,988
Give me the cross and I may let you live.

807
01:23:37,629 --> 01:23:40,063
You cut my friend in half, bast...

808
01:23:40,231 --> 01:23:43,325
- Come on. Come on.
What are you waiting for?

809
01:23:52,277 --> 01:23:55,508
Come on. Come here. Come here.

810
01:23:56,781 --> 01:23:57,839
Come on.

811
01:24:00,819 --> 01:24:01,945
Oh...

812
01:24:05,657 --> 01:24:07,625
Just wait. Just wait.

813
01:25:22,333 --> 01:25:24,665
All right, give me a second.

814
01:25:32,811 --> 01:25:35,780
- Aah! Jesus Christ.
- Are you okay?

815
01:25:35,947 --> 01:25:37,642
Yeah, it's an electric shock.

816
01:25:39,050 --> 01:25:40,642
Well, then.

817
01:25:47,959 --> 01:25:49,051
Come on.

818
01:25:49,928 --> 01:25:53,489
Come on. Yes.
It'll be here any second.

819
01:26:29,167 --> 01:26:30,964
Die, bitch.

820
01:26:44,349 --> 01:26:46,817
Tell me, what should I do?

821
01:26:49,320 --> 01:26:52,380
No!

822
01:26:53,157 --> 01:26:55,785
I'm going to kill you.

823
01:28:04,495 --> 01:28:06,053
Boris Bogdanovich.

824
01:28:06,230 --> 01:28:09,199
But please, don't call me B.B.

825
01:28:12,971 --> 01:28:14,063
Are you okay?

826
01:28:14,672 --> 01:28:16,071
You look terrible.

827
01:28:28,653 --> 01:28:32,111
There is bodies all over the shop.
This is one sick bastard.

828
01:28:41,332 --> 01:28:43,232
Wait, Ritchie.

829
01:28:57,582 --> 01:29:00,016
<i>- Mr. Groznyi, I have him.
- Bring him to me.</i>

830
01:29:01,019 --> 01:29:02,543
Come.

831
01:29:25,510 --> 01:29:26,807
Ritchie.

832
01:29:27,912 --> 01:29:29,140
Looking...

833
01:29:29,313 --> 01:29:30,678
...shit.

834
01:29:34,218 --> 01:29:35,480
Yeah.

835
01:29:39,157 --> 01:29:40,317
Oh, Ritchie.

836
01:29:42,126 --> 01:29:47,894
You have made me a very happy man.
Shake. We can be friends again. Shake.

837
01:29:48,066 --> 01:29:50,466
What did you know about the people
we robbed anyway?

838
01:29:51,235 --> 01:29:52,930
You tell me.

839
01:29:55,239 --> 01:29:58,572
- You got one hell of a family, Mr. Groznyi.
- Ha.

840
01:30:03,481 --> 01:30:04,971
I...

841
01:30:05,149 --> 01:30:08,084
...haven't seen my family
for the last 20 years.

842
01:30:08,252 --> 01:30:10,743
They make my life a misery
when I was growing up.

843
01:30:11,556 --> 01:30:13,854
You have any idea what they've
been getting up to?

844
01:30:14,025 --> 01:30:17,756
Who cares? You see, Ritchie,
I have now what I need.

845
01:30:19,097 --> 01:30:20,826
So you don't know anything?

846
01:30:20,998 --> 01:30:22,158
- No. Nothing.
- Nothing?

847
01:30:22,333 --> 01:30:24,801
- Didn't know a thing? Okay.
- Nothing.

848
01:30:24,969 --> 01:30:26,527
Forget it.

849
01:30:26,938 --> 01:30:29,668
Your whole family's pretty fucked up,
Mr. Groznyi.

850
01:30:30,374 --> 01:30:33,104
Hey, wait.
You actually have met my family?

851
01:30:33,277 --> 01:30:36,246
Oh, yeah. I killed them.

852
01:30:42,787 --> 01:30:44,482
Good boy.

853
01:30:45,423 --> 01:30:47,084
Here.

854
01:30:47,258 --> 01:30:50,386
Good boy. You take that beautiful girl,
you go on holiday.

855
01:30:50,561 --> 01:30:54,429
When you relax, you come back, you give
me a call and you work for me again.

856
01:30:54,599 --> 01:30:59,866
No. My debt's paid now.
That's it for me. I'm out.

857
01:31:00,037 --> 01:31:01,402
Hey, Ritchie.

858
01:31:02,740 --> 01:31:06,301
You are never out.

859
01:31:20,791 --> 01:31:22,622
What now?

860
01:31:23,928 --> 01:31:26,158
Do you think I'd like L.A.?
