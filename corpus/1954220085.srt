1
00:00:48,929 --> 00:00:51,609
Stop! God damn it!

2
00:00:53,074 --> 00:00:55,402
Dumb ass, you pulls up your
crime scene like that you're gonna

3
00:00:55,488 --> 00:00:57,250
contaminate the damn evidence.

4
00:01:00,296 --> 00:01:02,003
Oh my God!

5
00:01:05,394 --> 00:01:06,526
Oh yeah!

6
00:01:08,646 --> 00:01:11,870
Looks like the kid
is ripped ... apart.

7
00:01:20,863 --> 00:01:25,191
It's Casey Gotrea and his daddy.

8
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:30,942
You know what
did this, don't you?

9
00:01:30,943 --> 00:01:32,872
You don't want to hear
that ignorant shit, Mark.

10
00:01:33,117 --> 00:01:34,977
I mean you and me both of us
know what did this, Sheriff

11
00:01:35,478 --> 00:01:37,619
I'm out .....

12
00:01:40,288 --> 00:01:41,839
When you finished with
what you're doing there,

13
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,772
call the Coroner's office
and get him out here.

14
00:01:44,178 --> 00:01:45,386
I forgot to take, Sheriff.

15
00:01:47,428 --> 00:01:49,273
You still don't believe
how many dead bodies ...

16
00:01:49,274 --> 00:01:50,374
Now!

17
00:05:17,090 --> 00:05:20,546
We're all packed.  Do you want
to know where?  Here we come.

18
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:24,111
Let's go to my home.
I've got to shower.

19
00:05:33,674 --> 00:05:35,827
- Um Jen.
-Yeah.

20
00:05:36,881 --> 00:05:39,727
I have a little confession to make.

21
00:05:42,001 --> 00:05:44,033
What did you do this time?

22
00:05:44,878 --> 00:05:48,481
Remember when I told you my father's
godson was staying with us for a few weeks?

23
00:05:48,844 --> 00:05:52,117
Yeah, Dave or something ...
you said your dad was like

24
00:05:52,219 --> 00:05:54,647
helping him with career planning stuff.

25
00:05:54,648 --> 00:05:55,748
Right.

26
00:05:59,003 --> 00:06:01,510
I invited him to stay with us at
the cabin for a couple of nights.

27
00:06:01,511 --> 00:06:03,404
But only for a couple of nights.

28
00:06:03,405 --> 00:06:05,064
And then the rest of the
week, it'll just be me and you,

29
00:06:05,065 --> 00:06:06,561
and we'll just hang
and do girl's stuff.

30
00:06:06,562 --> 00:06:08,234
You know.
Have fun.

31
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:15,260
Maya.
This isn't supposed to be a party.

32
00:06:15,561 --> 00:06:18,866
I know.  And I know I
should have asked you first.

33
00:06:19,421 --> 00:06:21,744
But he really needs some time away.

34
00:06:22,308 --> 00:06:24,267
He's been through some shitty stuff.

35
00:06:25,744 --> 00:06:27,458
He's just as confused as you are,

36
00:06:28,259 --> 00:06:31,029
But he doesn't have a mom
like you, to attend to, you know.

37
00:06:31,330 --> 00:06:33,014
He's pretty lost.

38
00:06:33,015 --> 00:06:36,392
- You think I can talk to my mom.
- Yeah. Why not?

39
00:06:36,835 --> 00:06:40,686
Mom's great, Jen.  I don't
understand why you hate her so much.

40
00:06:43,048 --> 00:06:46,314
Are you mad?
Shit!  You're mad.

41
00:06:47,122 --> 00:06:48,076
Jen.

42
00:06:48,827 --> 00:06:52,199
I'm not mad.
You know I can't be mad at you.

43
00:06:53,009 --> 00:06:55,690
You're going to love him.
He's really cool.

44
00:06:55,691 --> 00:07:00,237
And he's smart like you, not
to mention he's smokin' hot.

45
00:07:00,321 --> 00:07:03,837
Maybe the two of you could,
you know ... hang out.

46
00:07:04,526 --> 00:07:05,961
I don't think so.

47
00:07:06,048 --> 00:07:07,267
Well, he is cute.

48
00:07:07,268 --> 00:07:10,574
If he wasn't in fact my brother,
I'll probably do him.

49
00:07:10,775 --> 00:07:12,809
I'm sure you will, Maya.

50
00:07:14,068 --> 00:07:16,867
- Bitch.
- Slut.

51
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:20,715
Hey ya, the way I see it ...
it will be good for you.

52
00:07:20,716 --> 00:07:22,565
You've always been such a loner.

53
00:07:22,666 --> 00:07:25,147
Plus, with me going away
to school next month.

54
00:07:25,748 --> 00:07:30,322
Anyway, being around someone besides me
might help draw you out of your funk.

55
00:07:32,121 --> 00:07:36,655
It's only a couple of days.
Cause you are cute.

56
00:08:08,986 --> 00:08:10,347
Who's that girl?

57
00:08:11,515 --> 00:08:13,144
I have no clue.

58
00:08:37,877 --> 00:08:40,667
- Hey sweetie. How you guys doing?
- Okay.

59
00:08:40,668 --> 00:08:43,295
- Guess we beat you here.
- Guess so.

60
00:08:43,530 --> 00:08:46,588
Jen, this is Dave.
Dave, this is Jennifer.

61
00:08:46,589 --> 00:08:49,588
- Hey Jen, how are you doing?
- Good. Okay.

62
00:08:49,623 --> 00:08:51,288
Nice to meet you.

63
00:08:52,901 --> 00:08:55,977
Yeah, and I brought
my friend, Brook.

64
00:08:56,925 --> 00:09:00,165
Who is she?
You never mentioned a girl.

65
00:09:00,535 --> 00:09:04,209
This is the girl I'm seeing.
You won't even know she is here.

66
00:09:05,582 --> 00:09:09,044
- It is okay, right?
- Oh, the more the merrier.

67
00:09:09,479 --> 00:09:12,337
So.
What is there to do around here?

68
00:09:13,873 --> 00:09:17,090
Uhh, there's canoeing,
we can rent a bike.

69
00:09:17,896 --> 00:09:21,140
Skinny dip,
You can bake in the sun.

70
00:09:42,783 --> 00:09:45,369
Just saying it's quicker.
Good work.

71
00:09:47,273 --> 00:09:50,653
Want to do it again?
Ok, to the tree and back.

72
00:09:50,851 --> 00:09:55,951
Okay, on your
mark, get set, go.

73
00:09:59,633 --> 00:10:03,030
Same time if you're tired.  We'll do
more once your breath pick up a bit.

74
00:10:04,029 --> 00:10:06,920
Jen, I have to be going.
You want to come say bye to me?

75
00:10:15,394 --> 00:10:18,754
Troy, just still take
good care of her.

76
00:10:20,979 --> 00:10:22,439
Yes, I will.

77
00:10:27,312 --> 00:10:28,900
I'll be back on Sunday, okay?

78
00:10:29,294 --> 00:10:32,554
I want you to call me every night
before you go to sleep, alright sweetie.

79
00:10:33,652 --> 00:10:34,943
Want to give me a hug?

80
00:10:36,390 --> 00:10:38,689
Jen, why don't you want
to give me a hug?  Come here.

81
00:10:42,424 --> 00:10:45,574
- You won't forget to call?
- No, I won't forget.

82
00:10:46,394 --> 00:10:48,874
- Have fun.
- I will.

83
00:10:48,875 --> 00:10:51,856
Be seeing you.
I love you, okay.

84
00:10:56,710 --> 00:10:58,938
Daddy!

85
00:10:59,163 --> 00:11:00,445
Yeah.  What was that for?

86
00:11:00,446 --> 00:11:02,787
I just missed you.
I just miss you so much.

87
00:11:02,788 --> 00:11:05,370
Oohh. Princess.

88
00:11:06,068 --> 00:11:09,200
Are you there Jen?
Hello.

89
00:11:10,054 --> 00:11:12,797
Jen, you okay?

90
00:11:12,798 --> 00:11:16,985
Oh, I'm great.
I'm not paying attention. Fine.

91
00:11:33,361 --> 00:11:36,092
Excuse me.

92
00:11:38,194 --> 00:11:41,326
- Home sweet home.
- Oh, my God.

93
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:43,597
Oh, Gods.

94
00:11:49,077 --> 00:11:51,677
It's nice.
Very nice.

95
00:11:55,910 --> 00:11:57,566
Is there a hotel around here?

96
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:01,918
Don't let the door hit
you in the ass, ok, Hon.

97
00:12:06,911 --> 00:12:08,072
She's kidding, right?

98
00:12:08,373 --> 00:12:12,562
Of course, she is ...duh.
Come on, let's go see the bedrooms.

99
00:12:15,456 --> 00:12:17,353
Let's go, pick out our room.

100
00:12:21,703 --> 00:12:25,029
- That one is a bedrooms?
- Yeah, you guys can have this one.

101
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:27,375
A twin bed?

102
00:12:27,732 --> 00:12:29,359
I'm sure you guys could figure it out.

103
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:32,334
Hell, there is always a porch
you can sleep in next.

104
00:12:36,535 --> 00:12:39,375
- It is cool, my gal.
- How?

105
00:13:26,218 --> 00:13:29,040
God, .. please make daddy and mommy

106
00:13:30,233 --> 00:13:33,753
in case I do make up for dad
to come back home again ...

107
00:13:33,754 --> 00:13:34,954
is that ......

108
00:13:43,946 --> 00:13:44,924
Jen.

109
00:13:55,567 --> 00:13:58,024
If we're staying late, maybe we should
go in town and get some supplies.

110
00:13:58,225 --> 00:14:01,030
I'll make a list for you and
Brenda to take to town.

111
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:04,149
- It's Brook.
- What?

112
00:14:04,702 --> 00:14:08,034
You just called me Brenda,
and my name is Brook.

113
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:13,119
Hey Maya, why don't
you just go with them.

114
00:14:14,503 --> 00:14:16,343
You know I'm going
to stay here with you?

115
00:14:16,887 --> 00:14:20,088
Actually, I'd rather be
alone with me, myself.

116
00:14:21,423 --> 00:14:24,955
Sure.  I mean, you are
okay being here, right?

117
00:14:26,629 --> 00:14:31,094
Yeah, I'm sure.
I'm fine really, sorry just...

118
00:14:31,421 --> 00:14:33,868
Really, it's cool.

119
00:14:35,598 --> 00:14:40,515
Okay.
All right guys, let's go.

120
00:15:07,133 --> 00:15:10,946
Welcome, all you in.
For whatever you want.

121
00:15:24,052 --> 00:15:26,007
You kids just passing through?

122
00:15:26,608 --> 00:15:29,984
No, we're staying at the
cabin on the lake, for a week.

123
00:15:32,516 --> 00:15:36,182
Ma'am I'm sorry but
there's something in this water.

124
00:15:36,183 --> 00:15:38,126
Oh dear!

125
00:15:41,570 --> 00:15:43,625
There you go, Hon.
All gone.

126
00:15:48,072 --> 00:15:52,825
Our dinner special tonight is fried
catfish, french fries and hash browns.

127
00:15:53,075 --> 00:15:57,924
And your choice of large beverage,
orange soda, iced tea and beer.

128
00:15:57,971 --> 00:16:01,923
Of course, if you all ask for beer,
I'm going have to see what I do.

129
00:16:02,324 --> 00:16:05,259
Um, I guess hush
puppies are like fries.

130
00:16:06,436 --> 00:16:12,379
You aren't from around here, are you?
-No, not even close.

131
00:16:13,165 --> 00:16:17,811
Of course they're fried, honey.
Did you ever hear of baked tush puppies?

132
00:16:22,182 --> 00:16:25,000
- I'll just have a cheeseburger and fries.
- Yeah, me too.

133
00:16:27,354 --> 00:16:29,882
Ahh, make it three
cheeseburgers and fries.

134
00:16:30,174 --> 00:16:32,188
All right.
Coming up.

135
00:16:37,301 --> 00:16:41,697
I mean, is it just me, or just
everyone here seem weird?

136
00:16:48,390 --> 00:16:49,609
No, it's not just you.

137
00:16:50,734 --> 00:16:53,823
Do you think that it's best
that we get out, quietly.

138
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:17,005
Hello, mum.

139
00:17:21,273 --> 00:17:22,334
Well, we're here

140
00:17:26,304 --> 00:17:27,851
I tried to, but ..here

141
00:17:31,166 --> 00:17:32,599
No, it's dead.

142
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:37,355
Yeah.

143
00:17:38,361 --> 00:17:40,196
Everything but the phone.

144
00:17:45,875 --> 00:17:48,111
That was supposed to be the idea.

145
00:17:51,019 --> 00:17:53,586
No, you don't.  You want
me to meet you, and I don't.

146
00:17:53,649 --> 00:17:55,544
And I am safe here.

147
00:17:57,100 --> 00:18:00,433
You know what. I have to go.
I'll call you when I get some ......

148
00:18:10,858 --> 00:18:14,853
Hello.
It's okay.

149
00:18:15,495 --> 00:18:18,971
I'm Dustin.  I live in the cabin
next door to where you're staying.

150
00:18:20,049 --> 00:18:23,228
- Well, you scared the shit out of me.
- That's right.

151
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:50,780
- Sure you don't want anything?
- No thank you.

152
00:18:52,629 --> 00:18:56,630
- You don't seem like a local.
- I'm not.

153
00:18:56,632 --> 00:19:00,812
- You live here now, though.
- For now.

154
00:19:04,528 --> 00:19:07,263
Did you realise you're over
10 miles from town, right?

155
00:19:07,764 --> 00:19:10,618
Yah, I remember that.
We drove here.

156
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:17,248
You carry that shotgun
with you, everywhere you go?

157
00:19:17,447 --> 00:19:19,613
If you've seen what I've
seen, you'd understand.

158
00:19:20,290 --> 00:19:21,745
And what have you seen?

159
00:19:28,139 --> 00:19:29,359
Long story.

160
00:19:30,815 --> 00:19:33,504
Well, I got time.
I'm gonna be here all week.

161
00:19:38,674 --> 00:19:41,078
I brought my wife Kay
out here, about a year ago.

162
00:20:20,258 --> 00:20:22,436
Dustin...

163
00:20:27,139 --> 00:20:29,345
That was the last time I saw her.

164
00:20:35,492 --> 00:20:36,947
Oh God.

165
00:20:38,686 --> 00:20:40,199
That's horrible.

166
00:20:43,378 --> 00:20:48,778
- Did they ever catch him?
- And it wasn't a man that took her.

167
00:20:49,371 --> 00:20:53,287
Well, if it wasn't a human,
then what was it?

168
00:20:55,878 --> 00:20:59,376
Your dad ...
never tell you about this place?

169
00:20:59,457 --> 00:21:03,541
You mean like, any other
American folklore, right?

170
00:21:05,689 --> 00:21:07,141
If you want to call it that.

171
00:21:09,561 --> 00:21:11,392
Well, I mean,
I read up on some of it

172
00:21:11,393 --> 00:21:13,889
when as was trying to
find out more about the place.

173
00:21:22,687 --> 00:21:24,521
You believe in all that, don't you?

174
00:21:25,338 --> 00:21:31,533
Like I said before Jeniffer,
this place isn't safe.

175
00:21:39,354 --> 00:21:44,537
I am really sorry about
what happened to your wife.

176
00:21:45,927 --> 00:21:47,286
I really am.

177
00:21:50,579 --> 00:21:54,510
Don't you think
... I don't know ...

178
00:21:54,804 --> 00:21:59,805
it's the kind of stuff that people make up
in small towns, cut through the bottom ..

179
00:22:00,306 --> 00:22:03,167
monsters and stuff.

180
00:22:04,110 --> 00:22:05,863
Let me put it to you like this.

181
00:22:07,264 --> 00:22:12,905
For about 30 years, people
in this town, pets, wild animals

182
00:22:12,906 --> 00:22:14,553
have been mutilated in these woods.

183
00:22:16,753 --> 00:22:18,905
That's your pattern.

184
00:22:21,318 --> 00:22:24,812
It seems that he mutilates
and kills the males and

185
00:22:26,216 --> 00:22:29,226
females, it seems he abducts.

186
00:22:33,022 --> 00:22:36,678
Every abduction, every
murder has gone unsolved ..

187
00:22:37,911 --> 00:22:39,378
And believe this.

188
00:22:40,414 --> 00:22:44,120
They will continue to go unsolved,
as long as it is still out there.

189
00:22:44,239 --> 00:22:46,863
But why just abduct the females?

190
00:22:49,744 --> 00:22:51,718
The creature is very human like us.

191
00:22:53,756 --> 00:22:57,781
Anatomy is very similar
to that of a male human.

192
00:22:59,345 --> 00:23:00,785
Very similar.

193
00:23:03,715 --> 00:23:08,166
Close enough that it can
breed with the human female.

194
00:23:14,228 --> 00:23:15,219
So yer

195
00:23:16,051 --> 00:23:19,771
maybe this small town
folks could do even this.

196
00:23:23,216 --> 00:23:26,341
But no one's gonna
do anything about that.

197
00:23:27,948 --> 00:23:30,450
There's something in these woods ...

198
00:23:31,826 --> 00:23:34,442
that's pure evil.

199
00:23:35,582 --> 00:23:38,027
How do you even want to say that.

200
00:23:39,157 --> 00:23:44,013
All I'm trying to say is ...
maybe you should leave, Jennifer.

201
00:23:58,714 --> 00:24:03,874
Okay, it's official.  Boggy Creek
is a 10.0 on a Creepy Scale.

202
00:24:03,875 --> 00:24:05,521
This place is weird.

203
00:24:18,269 --> 00:24:21,926
That Dustin guy sounds just as weird
as those freaks we saw in town today.

204
00:24:21,927 --> 00:24:24,707
Who isn't weird, Bud?

205
00:24:25,265 --> 00:24:28,113
He does think there's
something out there in the woods.

206
00:24:28,114 --> 00:24:30,969
Oooohh.
Is he hot?

207
00:24:31,876 --> 00:24:33,221
What?

208
00:24:33,422 --> 00:24:36,008
This mysterious cabin guy, Dustin.

209
00:24:36,343 --> 00:24:39,917
I don't know, I have no idea.

210
00:24:39,918 --> 00:24:40,821
He is.

211
00:24:42,425 --> 00:24:45,539
I knew it.  Oh, Jen.
You have a crush.

212
00:24:45,540 --> 00:24:47,522
He's okay.
He's so, so.

213
00:24:47,723 --> 00:24:49,212
You should hook up with him.

214
00:24:49,491 --> 00:24:52,633
If that ... guys I will march
right out there and do that.

215
00:24:52,634 --> 00:24:54,130
What?
You my pimp?

216
00:24:55,350 --> 00:24:59,297
Jen, I just want you to have some fun.
You know ... smile more.

217
00:25:02,429 --> 00:25:04,125
Alright, you guys
brought the tent, right?

218
00:25:04,126 --> 00:25:05,226
Mmm hmm.

219
00:25:05,227 --> 00:25:05,905
Excellent.

220
00:25:05,906 --> 00:25:09,395
Look, I got a portable stove,
propane, matches. I got everything.

221
00:25:09,396 --> 00:25:10,521
So I think we're good.

222
00:25:10,846 --> 00:25:13,739
You guys aren't going to be all scared
and shit out on the woods, will you.

223
00:25:14,427 --> 00:25:17,129
- Please
- I'm just saying, you know ...

224
00:25:18,065 --> 00:25:19,773
I don't want to be
the one doing all the work.

225
00:25:19,774 --> 00:25:21,737
We do for an all rough
and rough a bit, right?

226
00:25:21,838 --> 00:25:23,445
I like it scared.

227
00:25:23,746 --> 00:25:26,448
But if were up to me,
I would just stay here,

228
00:25:26,449 --> 00:25:31,003
where there is running water,
bath, nice comfortable bed.

229
00:25:42,867 --> 00:25:46,609
How could driving be so
damn tiring. I'm exhausted.

230
00:25:46,710 --> 00:25:47,976
I hear that.

231
00:25:49,094 --> 00:25:54,342
Well, you'll sleep like a baby tonight.
It is so peaceful out here.

232
00:26:37,022 --> 00:26:38,198
You've got to be kidding me.

233
00:26:40,046 --> 00:26:42,883
You guys mind?
We're trying to sleep in here.

234
00:26:47,898 --> 00:26:54,627
- Hey, what are you doing?
- Oh, nothing. Just writing.

235
00:26:58,941 --> 00:27:01,012
So is it sad being here?

236
00:27:02,616 --> 00:27:05,891
Ummm ... yeah.

237
00:27:07,349 --> 00:27:08,617
But it's a good sign.

238
00:27:10,053 --> 00:27:11,454
Good sign?

239
00:27:12,584 --> 00:27:19,381
Yeah like ... I don't know.
I missed him so much and

240
00:27:19,882 --> 00:27:23,537
while I'm here eventhough
he is not here anymore

241
00:27:23,691 --> 00:27:28,386
I feel like I'm more near him
than I have been in along time...

242
00:27:31,126 --> 00:27:34,464
like that I could ever be.
I don't know.  It's weird.

243
00:27:40,286 --> 00:27:43,069
Surrounded by his stuff.

244
00:27:47,522 --> 00:27:49,014
I feel like I'm home.

245
00:27:51,392 --> 00:27:53,300
Isn't that crazy?

246
00:28:00,542 --> 00:28:02,289
I feel a little crazy,
do you know?

247
00:28:03,332 --> 00:28:05,118
You're not crazy.

248
00:28:05,519 --> 00:28:10,882
You know Jen, I kind of envy
what you have with your dad.

249
00:28:12,452 --> 00:28:19,329
I mean, I know he died and all, but
you guys were really connected.

250
00:28:21,045 --> 00:28:26,591
That's something I never will
and never have with my parents.

251
00:28:29,545 --> 00:28:33,772
We're just, we're just so different.

252
00:28:36,991 --> 00:28:38,057
Yeah.

253
00:28:39,353 --> 00:28:42,633
You know.
In a way you're lucky.

254
00:28:47,287 --> 00:28:48,775
Yeah.  Maybe.

255
00:28:52,456 --> 00:28:57,217
You know, I don't know how your rotten
parents got such a wonderful daughter.

256
00:28:57,843 --> 00:29:01,506
- They are crazy.
- I know, that's why I have you.

257
00:29:01,507 --> 00:29:04,282
That's right.
You know that's true.

258
00:29:04,470 --> 00:29:06,920
- I love you, girl.
-I love you too, Maya.

259
00:29:08,102 --> 00:29:10,061
- Thanks for coming with me.
- Of course.

260
00:29:10,062 --> 00:29:13,429
- Even if you had to bring a circus.
- I'm sorry.

261
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:17,599
It'll get better, I promise.

262
00:29:17,459 --> 00:29:19,415
You always got to bring a party with you ....

263
00:29:19,416 --> 00:29:24,023
I know right. Hey it's all your ....
Good night.

264
00:29:24,224 --> 00:29:25,161
Good night.

265
00:30:13,685 --> 00:30:15,043
Were you just in the woods?

266
00:30:15,844 --> 00:30:19,546
I don't want you in the woods, ever.
You understand me young lady?

267
00:30:19,547 --> 00:30:21,800
Cause the woods are
very dangerous, sweetie.

268
00:30:22,501 --> 00:30:24,337
No one should go in there.

269
00:30:25,506 --> 00:30:28,562
It's best you don't
... don't go.

270
00:30:36,038 --> 00:30:37,935
- What's wrong?
- I just ... I thought ...

271
00:30:37,928 --> 00:30:39,996
I thought I heard something.
I guess ...

272
00:30:40,397 --> 00:30:44,665
- You didn't hear anything?
- No, I didn't hear anything.

273
00:30:48,566 --> 00:30:50,306
Well, I'll just go back to sleep.

274
00:30:57,653 --> 00:30:59,709
Yah ... Just look at their faces.

275
00:31:00,110 --> 00:31:03,255
That was like "Aaahh, Aaahh"

276
00:31:03,274 --> 00:31:05,474
That was a shitty
thing to do, Tommy.

277
00:31:06,599 --> 00:31:12,169
Oh, come on, man.  Hey, we're
on vaca... Remember?  Chill!

278
00:31:12,257 --> 00:31:15,616
Now look, if everything is okay,
we will go back to bed.

279
00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:19,828
Yah, everything's fine. My boyfriend
just has a sick sense of humour.

280
00:31:20,029 --> 00:31:22,754
He is a bit challenged in
the maturity department.

281
00:31:24,791 --> 00:31:29,773
Come on, hey. What?
Oh, come on babe.

282
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:33,788
Look, it was just a joke,
all right.   That's all it was.

283
00:31:34,616 --> 00:31:36,053
You all, two just make the ...

284
00:31:36,054 --> 00:31:39,091
have some fun, and loosen up
a little bit man, for real.

285
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:45,073
But you should have seen your faces,
Blehhh, Aaahhh.

286
00:31:46,945 --> 00:31:49,814
Behave!
I'll be right back.

287
00:31:54,422 --> 00:31:59,296
I'm just getting started.  What I need
to do is just live a little bit. That's all.

288
00:32:01,515 --> 00:32:02,405
Come on.

289
00:32:02,897 --> 00:32:04,229
Life's too short.

290
00:32:12,344 --> 00:32:15,648
Jen. I am so sorry he did that.

291
00:32:15,649 --> 00:32:17,489
Why, oh, why is he even here?

292
00:32:17,842 --> 00:32:20,689
I wasn't sure he'd come,
or else I would have told you.

293
00:32:21,099 --> 00:32:23,893
He had a job just a couple of hours
away, and is off work tomorrow,

294
00:32:23,894 --> 00:32:25,461
so he want to come and hang out.

295
00:32:25,707 --> 00:32:28,775
But I promise, he's
gone by Monday morning.

296
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:32,939
Cross my heart. Hope to die.
Stick a needle in my eye.

297
00:32:34,863 --> 00:32:35,882
Sorry.

298
00:32:37,608 --> 00:32:41,492
Just don't wake me with
anymore of your surprises, Maya.

299
00:32:43,249 --> 00:32:46,418
Okay.
Good night.

300
00:33:44,547 --> 00:33:45,777
Hello?

301
00:33:47,818 --> 00:33:51,518
- Somebody there?
- Who is it?

302
00:33:54,491 --> 00:33:56,004
If I could see somebody out there,

303
00:33:56,005 --> 00:33:57,846
you think I'll be asking if
there's anybody out there.

304
00:33:57,847 --> 00:33:58,979
Don't talk to me like that.

305
00:33:58,980 --> 00:34:01,591
- Like what?
- Like an asshole.

306
00:34:28,032 --> 00:34:30,069
Baby...

307
00:36:37,926 --> 00:36:39,946
You know, I didn't
realize that my fantasy

308
00:36:39,947 --> 00:36:42,568
of sleeping with 2 beautiful
women will end up like this.

309
00:36:43,478 --> 00:36:44,613
Shit...

310
00:36:45,314 --> 00:36:47,738
I mean that floor
is hard as hell.

311
00:36:49,372 --> 00:36:50,447
Where's  Jennifer?

312
00:36:50,948 --> 00:36:54,367
She's probably out running.
She does it every morning.

313
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:09,566
Doesn't she know that leaving
us alone like this is dangerous?

314
00:37:11,594 --> 00:37:12,831
Whatever.

315
00:37:13,068 --> 00:37:14,448
Come here, girl.

316
00:37:47,825 --> 00:37:52,582
Klein, call the coroner.
Tell him you got another one.

317
00:37:54,021 --> 00:37:58,110
When you're done, just get your
pussy ass over here and help me.

318
00:38:22,655 --> 00:38:25,016
Don't be such a scaredy-cat.
Get in.

319
00:38:25,017 --> 00:38:26,221
Hey, hey.
Stop playing.

320
00:38:26,222 --> 00:38:27,894
I'm not getting in there.
Look at it.

321
00:38:27,895 --> 00:38:29,693
Look at all the green
stuff floating around.

322
00:38:30,065 --> 00:38:31,832
Like fish poop or something.

323
00:38:32,133 --> 00:38:33,852
Far as I know it
can be some green,

324
00:38:33,853 --> 00:38:36,281
flesh eating bacterial
disease or something like that.

325
00:38:36,516 --> 00:38:40,210
Like you even know what bacteria is.
It's just dousy, dumb-ass.

326
00:38:40,237 --> 00:38:41,222
Come on.
Jump in.

327
00:38:41,266 --> 00:38:44,200
No, I don't look like I'll ... You can
chill black ass ...You gonna jump.

328
00:38:44,350 --> 00:38:47,938
- Fine Tommy. ...get even worse.
- Whatever.

329
00:38:51,019 --> 00:38:52,736
Well, I guess I better
just get it over with.

330
00:38:52,737 --> 00:38:53,837
Get it over with.

331
00:38:54,838 --> 00:38:56,211
I can't do it.

332
00:38:56,212 --> 00:38:58,509
I can't. I told you ...
It's nasty, huh.

333
00:38:58,510 --> 00:39:00,067
Yeah ....
Could not do it.

334
00:39:06,245 --> 00:39:07,695
Watch out.

335
00:39:08,315 --> 00:39:09,710
Do you mind?
What's up, baby?

336
00:39:09,816 --> 00:39:11,467
Morning
-Morning

337
00:39:11,468 --> 00:39:12,477
What you guy's doing, man.

338
00:39:12,773 --> 00:39:15,469
Oh, she thought she was about to
get me in that nasty ass water, man.

339
00:39:15,470 --> 00:39:16,821
No, she didn't get it neither, though.

340
00:39:16,822 --> 00:39:17,922
No, it was .....

341
00:39:18,021 --> 00:39:21,529
No, we are not at the beach, guys.
I'm not getting in.

342
00:39:21,530 --> 00:39:24,317
Hey, so did she tell to you about that
interesting experience at the diner?

343
00:39:24,352 --> 00:39:27,575
- Yah, yah.
- She told me that. That was classic.

344
00:39:27,990 --> 00:39:31,361
Yeah, oh my God.
The people in this town are so spooky.

345
00:39:31,362 --> 00:39:33,988
I mean, we walk in the diner,
from the moment we walked in,

346
00:39:33,989 --> 00:39:35,984
they just stared at
us, the whole time.

347
00:39:35,985 --> 00:39:36,900
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

348
00:39:36,901 --> 00:39:38,459
And this old guy
was on the porch,

349
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:42,054
I expected him to take out his banjo
and just go to work when we walked out.

350
00:41:03,516 --> 00:41:05,778
Hey, I can't do this anymore, Troy.

351
00:41:06,906 --> 00:41:08,545
I can't be doing this.

352
00:41:08,546 --> 00:41:12,733
Remember I said
I got to discuss my .....

353
00:41:14,594 --> 00:41:16,654
You made that painfully obvious, girl.

354
00:41:17,670 --> 00:41:23,983
Well, I'm done. I'm finished and
mean at this time, I'm going back.

355
00:41:27,012 --> 00:41:28,656
Do you have anything to say?

356
00:41:34,530 --> 00:41:35,962
Well, goodbye baby.

357
00:41:48,042 --> 00:41:50,750
So Jen is pretty bent out of shape
about us being here, huh?

358
00:41:50,751 --> 00:41:52,011
No, she's fine.

359
00:41:52,695 --> 00:41:54,098
She doesn't seem fine.

360
00:41:54,685 --> 00:41:58,568
Well, it's kind of my fault.
I kind of put her on the spot.

361
00:41:58,753 --> 00:42:01,365
She's just really been a mess
after her father dying and all,

362
00:42:01,366 --> 00:42:03,513
and I didn't realize she
wanted to be here alone.

363
00:42:04,108 --> 00:42:05,929
Now look.
Jen is a sweet girl.

364
00:42:05,930 --> 00:42:08,443
She's just got a lot of things
she's gonna do right now, that's all.

365
00:42:08,544 --> 00:42:09,839
She'll be all right.

366
00:42:09,850 --> 00:42:11,224
Well, maybe but ...

367
00:42:11,025 --> 00:42:14,057
I'm sorry. That doesn't give
you the excuse to be just so bad.

368
00:42:14,058 --> 00:42:17,351
Hey! Watch it girl.  That's my
best friend you're talking about.

369
00:42:18,785 --> 00:42:19,875
Now you know what?

370
00:42:19,876 --> 00:42:24,026
I actually think it's great that she's
actually around people, you know.

371
00:42:24,227 --> 00:42:27,409
I mean, being alone by yourself,
being a hermit like that.

372
00:42:27,410 --> 00:42:29,530
That can't be good for nobody.

373
00:42:30,774 --> 00:42:32,794
What happened to her dad, anyway?

374
00:42:35,884 --> 00:42:39,695
He was found on the side of the
highway up there. In his running clothes.

375
00:42:42,330 --> 00:42:46,343
They think it was a hit-and-run.
Some sort of large vehicle.

376
00:42:48,209 --> 00:42:52,445
When they found him,
he was almost unrecognizable.

377
00:42:53,387 --> 00:42:55,194
Shit, that's awful.

378
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:59,966
I've heard worse.  I mean,
at least he didn't suffer, right?

379
00:43:02,395 --> 00:43:03,437
What?

380
00:43:03,638 --> 00:43:06,183
All I meant was that
some people suffered.

381
00:43:06,184 --> 00:43:09,743
He was lucky in like
a weird sort of way.

382
00:43:19,631 --> 00:43:22,328
- Hey.
- Hey.

383
00:43:26,942 --> 00:43:29,026
So you all want to take
the boat out or something?

384
00:44:41,773 --> 00:44:44,957
I'm so hungry.
I'll go make sandwiches.

385
00:44:45,058 --> 00:44:46,796
You know,
actually I'll go with you.

386
00:44:46,797 --> 00:44:49,370
No, no.  Stay here.
It'll only take me a few minutes.

387
00:44:52,695 --> 00:44:54,079
All right.

388
00:44:56,678 --> 00:44:59,131
- I got you.
- Only landing bush.

389
00:44:59,713 --> 00:45:02,331
- Here you go.
- Now, work Buddy.

390
00:45:12,440 --> 00:45:15,617
- Hey.
- So what are you writing about?

391
00:45:17,002 --> 00:45:20,517
- Nothing.
- Nothing, huh.

392
00:45:21,615 --> 00:45:23,935
Hey look, I'm sorry for
imposing by being out here.

393
00:45:23,936 --> 00:45:25,334
It's okay.

394
00:45:29,478 --> 00:45:32,122
- It's a great place.
- Yeah, I like it.

395
00:45:35,366 --> 00:45:38,402
Dave .. can you come
here for a second?

396
00:45:38,403 --> 00:45:40,078
Just hold on.
Give me a minute.

397
00:45:42,949 --> 00:45:46,341
- So how long did your dad live out here?
- 11 years.

398
00:45:48,235 --> 00:45:50,964
And this is the first time
that I've been back in a while.

399
00:45:51,798 --> 00:45:54,447
- Aren't you guys in a fight or something?
- No.

400
00:45:56,713 --> 00:46:02,701
No fight.  My dad he just
had some issues with people.

401
00:46:03,949 --> 00:46:07,954
- That sucks.
- Yeah.

402
00:46:08,387 --> 00:46:09,470
Dave.

403
00:46:10,971 --> 00:46:14,110
Can you put some
sunscreen on my back?

404
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:16,420
Oh, damn.

405
00:46:26,678 --> 00:46:28,041
Don't leave me out here.

406
00:46:33,733 --> 00:46:35,824
Nolan, what the hell!
My car!

407
00:46:36,770 --> 00:46:38,648
Don't act like you didn't do that.

408
00:46:44,847 --> 00:46:46,529
How the hell did you
get that on the car?

409
00:46:47,043 --> 00:46:51,660
Dude, why in the heat hell, would
I drive all the way out here

410
00:46:51,661 --> 00:46:54,302
from butt fucked Egypt,
to decapitate piggy

411
00:46:54,303 --> 00:46:57,561
and then sit around and just look
this nasty ass shit on my car, huh?

412
00:46:57,562 --> 00:46:59,050
Why would I do
something like that, Dave?

413
00:46:59,485 --> 00:47:00,892
We should call the cops.

414
00:47:01,719 --> 00:47:04,519
- There are cops around here, right?
-No.

415
00:47:05,746 --> 00:47:07,905
Right.  Just hold off
on calling the cops.

416
00:47:07,906 --> 00:47:09,852
You two try not
to kill each other.

417
00:47:09,903 --> 00:47:13,363
- I'm going to handle this.
I'll be right back.
- Wait. Jen, where are you going?

418
00:47:14,064 --> 00:47:15,581
We'll be right back.

419
00:47:16,779 --> 00:47:19,878
- I'm not the only one to
be digging this grave.
- You gotta to digging that.

420
00:47:19,879 --> 00:47:21,473
You're gonna be
helping to dig this, too.

421
00:47:25,392 --> 00:47:26,845
Shut up, white boy!

422
00:47:39,574 --> 00:47:41,937
Dustin, it's Jennifer from next door.

423
00:47:43,482 --> 00:47:45,679
If you're in there,
please open up.

424
00:47:52,091 --> 00:47:53,458
I'm not in there.

425
00:47:54,734 --> 00:47:57,377
Someone threw a mutilated hog
on the hood of my friend's car,

426
00:47:57,378 --> 00:47:59,085
and I want to know if it was you.

427
00:47:59,486 --> 00:48:00,743
It wasn't me.

428
00:48:02,643 --> 00:48:04,597
By the way, I'm Maya.

429
00:48:06,811 --> 00:48:09,922
So wait. We're suppose to just
believe that it magically appeared there.

430
00:48:10,123 --> 00:48:12,844
I don't care what you believe.
I told you I didn't do it.

431
00:48:14,095 --> 00:48:16,988
Look, you're in a swamp
surrounded by deep woods,

432
00:48:16,989 --> 00:48:18,506
there are dead
animals everywhere.

433
00:48:18,807 --> 00:48:23,022
Just like I told you last night,
there's something out there.

434
00:48:23,423 --> 00:48:25,715
It's been mutilating
animals for years,

435
00:48:26,475 --> 00:48:31,234
even worse,
sometimes it mutilates people ...

436
00:48:31,635 --> 00:48:35,647
who happen to be in the
wrong place, at the wrong time.

437
00:48:36,199 --> 00:48:41,224
Aw come on, you're not talking
about the bigfoot.  Shit .. again.

438
00:48:45,129 --> 00:48:48,674
I'm really sorry about
what happened to your wife,

439
00:48:49,170 --> 00:48:50,754
and I think that you know that.

440
00:48:52,218 --> 00:48:54,384
But I'm not going to be scared off.

441
00:48:55,626 --> 00:49:01,919
My father, he left me that cabin and
I intend to stay there as long as I want.

442
00:49:02,583 --> 00:49:06,361
Hey look, if you're so convinced
that there is something out here.

443
00:49:06,362 --> 00:49:07,726
Why are you here?

444
00:49:17,079 --> 00:49:21,434
Did you here anything about
these girls getting out of here?

445
00:49:26,928 --> 00:49:30,073
Well. Was that supposed to
be a threat or something?  Huh.

446
00:49:30,615 --> 00:49:32,011
You two, chill.

447
00:49:32,303 --> 00:49:33,911
You I'm just saying,
he's got a gun.

448
00:49:33,912 --> 00:49:35,722
Well I just saying, if he
was a threat or something,

449
00:49:35,723 --> 00:49:37,597
then maybe we should do
something about it, you know.

450
00:49:37,619 --> 00:49:38,895
Well, that's just great!

451
00:49:38,896 --> 00:49:43,997
We've got dead pigs, man with a gun,
Bigfoot.  You 2 morons, in your car.

452
00:49:47,517 --> 00:49:50,345
- Hey.
- Hey.

453
00:49:54,525 --> 00:49:57,733
Damn. Well, that's done with.

454
00:50:00,549 --> 00:50:05,826
- I love Texas thunderstorms.
- Yeah, me too.

455
00:50:06,388 --> 00:50:09,091
I love it, like, just like this
white one I saw at the pool.

456
00:50:11,697 --> 00:50:12,817
Where's Brook?

457
00:50:13,318 --> 00:50:16,938
She had to sleep for a little bit.
Said she feels nauseous.

458
00:50:17,762 --> 00:50:19,186
She's pregnant.

459
00:50:21,849 --> 00:50:23,237
She got an IV.

460
00:50:29,025 --> 00:50:31,687
- So what was that all about earlier.
- What do you mean?

461
00:50:31,705 --> 00:50:33,421
The conversation
with your neighbour.

462
00:50:33,722 --> 00:50:37,268
Think he's the one that
threw the pig on Tommy's car?

463
00:50:37,588 --> 00:50:39,796
I think he really doesn't
want us to be here

464
00:50:40,306 --> 00:50:43,461
and it make sense
that it would be him.

465
00:50:43,583 --> 00:50:47,336
Right, Tommy's afraid of aussie,
I don't see him killing a pig,

466
00:50:47,337 --> 00:50:49,230
dragging it through the woods.
You know what I mean?

467
00:50:49,276 --> 00:50:50,476
I guess you're right.

468
00:50:50,477 --> 00:50:54,578
Like if it's him, our neighbour and us out
here. You know what I'm saying like ...

469
00:50:54,979 --> 00:50:56,353
Yah, I think it's him.

470
00:50:57,576 --> 00:51:01,695
What do you think about this whole
Bigfoot thing? Do you think that's real?

471
00:51:03,150 --> 00:51:04,832
Where are you offing toward that?

472
00:51:07,453 --> 00:51:12,520
I have never been one for fantasy.
No.

473
00:51:13,984 --> 00:51:19,369
Even if I was, I would be a lot more
terrified with some psychotic human being,

474
00:51:19,370 --> 00:51:22,484
like, going after
people with a machete.

475
00:51:22,519 --> 00:51:26,892
You know what I mean, like
not some big scary ape, please.

476
00:51:43,666 --> 00:51:44,874
Hit!

477
00:51:45,675 --> 00:51:47,045
What the hell!
What you doing?

478
00:51:47,049 --> 00:51:48,825
Babe, do this.
Come here and do it.

479
00:51:48,826 --> 00:51:52,432
Let me show you how you do it.
Watch the man how he did...

480
00:51:55,749 --> 00:51:58,139
Ahh, you suck.
Let me show you.

481
00:51:58,140 --> 00:52:00,625
No, no, no.  I was going to do that
...in high school though.

482
00:52:00,694 --> 00:52:03,847
- Where's Dave?
- He's out on the porch with Jennifer.

483
00:52:12,265 --> 00:52:13,358
Dave!

484
00:52:14,635 --> 00:52:16,455
Can you come inside?
I'm scared.

485
00:52:17,279 --> 00:52:18,471
One second.

486
00:52:23,070 --> 00:52:25,199
No. Now.

487
00:52:25,502 --> 00:52:27,406
Look. Just give me a minute.

488
00:52:27,736 --> 00:52:30,924
You know ....
getting a little sick of this shit.

489
00:52:32,340 --> 00:52:35,028
- What shit?
- You two flirting.

490
00:52:35,415 --> 00:52:36,578
What the hell!

491
00:52:41,562 --> 00:52:46,325
I get it.  Do you want to
bang her or something?

492
00:52:47,047 --> 00:52:50,252
Do you Dave?
Huh?

493
00:53:13,540 --> 00:53:14,576
What?

494
00:53:15,177 --> 00:53:18,944
Nothing man. Nothing
at all.  I'm just saying.

495
00:53:20,547 --> 00:53:21,795
Hey, you know what?

496
00:53:23,093 --> 00:53:28,303
Why don't you come on over here
by our side. Come here. Come on girl.

497
00:53:34,561 --> 00:53:38,070
Alright.
Let me help you out.

498
00:53:40,174 --> 00:53:41,238
Fine, sorts.

499
00:53:44,911 --> 00:53:47,063
That's a double for ...
you drink it kind of real slow.

500
00:53:49,281 --> 00:53:50,406
That's done it.

501
00:53:55,455 --> 00:53:58,939
Can you help her,
I got something for you ...

502
00:54:07,861 --> 00:54:10,843
I just ...
You know what ...just

503
00:54:16,830 --> 00:54:21,340
You guys are so great.
I love you so much.

504
00:54:34,186 --> 00:54:35,302
It's good.

505
00:54:41,548 --> 00:54:43,467
Maybe I'd better ...

506
00:54:44,868 --> 00:54:46,970
That's fine.
I'll catch you later.

507
00:55:04,570 --> 00:55:09,041
What exactly do you find
so interesting about her?

508
00:55:09,581 --> 00:55:11,021
What?

509
00:55:11,340 --> 00:55:14,641
- I see the way you look at her.
- What are you talking about, Brook?

510
00:55:14,991 --> 00:55:18,591
I can get any guy I want,
and I chose to be with you.

511
00:55:18,592 --> 00:55:20,531
So don't pull
this shit on me now.

512
00:55:20,532 --> 00:55:22,495
- Anyone?
- Yeah, anyone.

513
00:55:22,594 --> 00:55:25,303
Okay, then be with anyone.

514
00:55:35,032 --> 00:55:36,265
Thanks, bitch.

515
00:55:44,676 --> 00:55:47,757
Hey, maybe you can
hook up with Dave now.

516
00:55:54,904 --> 00:55:58,206
- Guys, I'm sorry.
- Don't be. It's not your fault.

517
00:55:58,627 --> 00:56:01,728
Hey, you you not going to ...
chase your girl, man?

518
00:56:01,729 --> 00:56:05,757
No, that's what she expects me to do.
She's not going anywhere.

519
00:56:05,758 --> 00:56:08,627
She's just a little bit
high maintenance, huh?

520
00:56:08,628 --> 00:56:10,250
Uh, no. She thinks...

521
00:56:10,251 --> 00:56:11,988
Yeah, a little.

522
00:56:13,449 --> 00:56:15,508
So how many drinks did
you make for her, anyway?

523
00:56:15,663 --> 00:56:17,504
Oh, I only gave
her two of mine.

524
00:56:18,966 --> 00:56:19,718
Don't.

525
00:56:23,094 --> 00:56:26,191
- Then she took the whole bottle.
- Oh, shit.

526
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:29,347
Alright, time I boo-boo.
I know.

527
00:56:34,266 --> 00:56:37,458
I'm pretty tired, lady.

528
00:56:41,192 --> 00:56:43,296
I hear you all.
I'm exhausted myself.

529
00:56:45,409 --> 00:56:47,907
You know, you all can actually
take the bed if you want.

530
00:56:47,908 --> 00:56:49,866
No, Jen. It's alright.

531
00:56:49,867 --> 00:56:51,105
No, seriously.
It's fine.

532
00:56:51,139 --> 00:56:53,691
I don't even have the
energy to get off this couch.

533
00:56:54,107 --> 00:56:55,140
So go right ahead.

534
00:56:56,016 --> 00:56:57,372
Yeah, you sure about that?

535
00:56:57,373 --> 00:57:00,434
I'm sure.
You have to change the sheets.

536
00:57:02,007 --> 00:57:03,261
Thanks, girl.

537
00:57:05,020 --> 00:57:06,263
Sorry about the mess.

538
00:57:19,221 --> 00:57:21,051
Are you sure you don't
want to go after her?

539
00:57:21,052 --> 00:57:26,205
No, she's done this before.
Trust me.

540
00:57:26,506 --> 00:57:28,697
She'll be back once she calms down.

541
00:57:29,168 --> 00:57:30,396
Fucking asshole.

542
00:57:31,089 --> 00:57:32,649
Should have never come
here with him anyway.

543
00:57:32,650 --> 00:57:34,333
I mean, who does
he think he is, right?

544
00:57:34,534 --> 00:57:36,036
What a prick.

545
00:57:43,804 --> 00:57:44,511
Hello?

546
00:57:46,855 --> 00:57:47,976
Hello?

547
00:57:51,220 --> 00:57:55,051
Where am I?
Please, just me.

548
00:57:55,752 --> 00:57:56,775
Shit!

549
00:58:39,652 --> 00:58:40,946
Jesus Christ!

550
00:58:41,047 --> 00:58:45,247
Thanks for looking for me, asshole.
I could have been killed out there.

551
00:58:59,120 --> 00:59:01,287
...tried to pull this crap on me.

552
00:59:15,806 --> 00:59:20,082
... fucking asshole. You think you
can get back at me. I don't think so.

553
00:59:34,456 --> 00:59:35,694
Shit!

554
00:59:40,241 --> 00:59:41,226
Somebody's there.

555
00:59:43,690 --> 00:59:45,531
..enough of this car being shit!

556
00:59:48,826 --> 00:59:51,648
Bloody Jen.
I can't take this lying down.

557
00:59:51,949 --> 00:59:53,138
Jones!

558
01:00:26,913 --> 01:00:29,857
Good morning, sunshine.
How are you?

559
01:00:29,958 --> 01:00:32,913
Damn.
Do you have to be so loud?

560
01:00:34,976 --> 01:00:35,896
Sorry.

561
01:00:35,897 --> 01:00:36,818
I got this.
I got it.

562
01:00:40,789 --> 01:00:42,602
Hey also.
Where's your girl, man?

563
01:00:43,803 --> 01:00:45,102
I don't know.

564
01:00:45,103 --> 01:00:47,282
She up yet?
Is she coming, or?

565
01:00:47,783 --> 01:00:50,188
You see, dude.
She jacked my truck last night.

566
01:00:50,389 --> 01:00:51,822
Went to some motel.

567
01:00:52,423 --> 01:00:54,105
Yeah, stupid.

568
01:00:54,106 --> 01:00:57,255
I guess the way she was acting, she felt,
hey I don't want to show my face again.

569
01:00:57,256 --> 01:00:58,134
Whatever.

570
01:00:58,235 --> 01:01:00,031
I'm gonna check on
her tomorrow afternoon.

571
01:01:00,532 --> 01:01:03,547
Okay guys,
I got the waters.  Here.

572
01:01:07,191 --> 01:01:09,875
Hey, bro.
Are these yours?

573
01:01:12,358 --> 01:01:14,684
Yah, alright man.
Very funny

574
01:03:26,647 --> 01:03:29,275
Why so much food?  You'd think we
won't be coming back or something.

575
01:03:29,457 --> 01:03:31,093
Well, that's because
my girl's on her ass.

576
01:03:31,094 --> 01:03:34,190
You see, when she is on a rag
like that, she gets very hungry.

577
01:03:34,191 --> 01:03:36,833
- Ah, asshole.
- I'm just saying it.

578
01:03:38,229 --> 01:03:41,801
Did you know that it's not such a good
idea to be out in the woods with a bleeder.

579
01:03:41,902 --> 01:03:43,925
- What?
- Yeah.

580
01:03:44,526 --> 01:03:45,488
Why?

581
01:03:45,600 --> 01:03:51,223
It just, attracts the wild animals, they can
smell the blood from miles away.

582
01:03:52,471 --> 01:03:53,214
Haaa!

583
01:05:03,693 --> 01:05:06,107
Aw, what's wrong man.
Does this make you miss your girl?

584
01:05:06,208 --> 01:05:12,101
Well, hell no, man. As soon as we
get back, it's over. That was a mistake.

585
01:05:12,102 --> 01:05:16,406
Really. So what do you think she is
doing all alone by herself in the hotel?

586
01:05:16,507 --> 01:05:20,226
Probably sticking little needles in a
Voodoo doll that looks just like me.

587
01:05:22,772 --> 01:05:26,001
Wow.  This is
lovers lane, huh, Jen?

588
01:05:26,505 --> 01:05:31,273
You know what. Your dad can
definitely pick up till midnight..

589
01:06:05,328 --> 01:06:08,170
Listen. I'm going to finish up.
So as I was saying.

590
01:06:08,180 --> 01:06:11,750
So tell us like, this guy
with a hockey mask on, right.

591
01:06:11,863 --> 01:06:15,112
He comes over to the cabin,
he just starts, going at him,

592
01:06:15,113 --> 01:06:17,315
and slashing this guy,
just picking him up

593
01:06:17,316 --> 01:06:19,998
and put him in the back pack
and store him just to choose him,

594
01:06:19,999 --> 01:06:20,906
everything like that.

595
01:06:22,207 --> 01:06:23,799
Dude, we heard that one before.

596
01:06:26,760 --> 01:06:29,688
Fine, why, you got a
better one you can tell?

597
01:06:30,611 --> 01:06:32,867
Campfire stories are lame.

598
01:06:34,051 --> 01:06:36,931
Well, this sucks right, man, whatever.
You got one better?

599
01:06:38,973 --> 01:06:41,650
- Okay, baby.
- Thank you.

600
01:06:42,511 --> 01:06:46,145
So when you get back, how long
are you going to be staying in .....?

601
01:06:46,648 --> 01:06:51,089
Well, actually, that was
supposed to be a surprise.

602
01:06:51,790 --> 01:06:52,739
What surprise?

603
01:06:53,873 --> 01:06:57,268
In two weeks,
I'm off to boot camp.

604
01:06:57,669 --> 01:07:01,330
- Are you serious?
- Yup. Time to cut the hair.

605
01:07:02,046 --> 01:07:03,188
Does my dad know?

606
01:07:04,089 --> 01:07:05,967
He's actually the one that got me in.

607
01:07:05,968 --> 01:07:08,511
Now, we don't want to say
anything till we knew for sure.

608
01:07:09,578 --> 01:07:12,468
But I didn't think
I had a chance till now.

609
01:07:13,835 --> 01:07:17,766
If I play my cards right, in a few
years, I can apply to become an officer.

610
01:07:18,533 --> 01:07:21,473
Maybe fly helicopters or shit.
How cool would that be?

611
01:07:21,553 --> 01:07:22,722
That'll be cool man.

612
01:07:23,446 --> 01:07:26,511
Oh, that's great Dave.
I'm so glad of you.

613
01:07:26,512 --> 01:07:27,612
Thanks.

614
01:07:27,613 --> 01:07:28,675
Well, congratulations.

615
01:07:30,313 --> 01:07:31,589
Thanks.

616
01:07:34,443 --> 01:07:38,615
I'm gonna go to bed, guys.
We got a long hike tomorrow.

617
01:07:38,640 --> 01:07:41,123
Yeah, me too.
I'm getting pretty sleepy.

618
01:07:42,134 --> 01:07:44,130
All right.
I'll put out the fire.

619
01:07:51,159 --> 01:07:53,827
- You having fun.
- I am.

620
01:07:54,893 --> 01:07:59,468
- You forgive now for inviting Davies?
- I guess I have to ...

621
01:08:00,333 --> 01:08:04,535
I'm glad Tommy and Dave
were here .... not so much Brook.

622
01:08:05,036 --> 01:08:06,939
Yeah, I know.
Tell me about it.

623
01:08:06,940 --> 01:08:11,206
I'm so happy she didn't come. That
girl has a couple of screws loose.

624
01:08:13,207 --> 01:08:14,717
Are you girls decent?

625
01:08:14,831 --> 01:08:17,847
Aren't you suppose to ask that
question before you poke your head in?

626
01:08:17,848 --> 01:08:18,748
No, what would be the fun in that?

627
01:08:20,017 --> 01:08:23,233
- Hey, where's Tommy?
- Using the boy's room.

628
01:08:26,791 --> 01:08:28,071
So, where is it going to sleep?

629
01:08:29,734 --> 01:08:33,369
Well I'm here, and the 2
lovebirds are over there,

630
01:08:33,440 --> 01:08:35,303
and you are here.

631
01:08:36,104 --> 01:08:36,963
Cool.

632
01:08:39,819 --> 01:08:42,685
Ten kids. Hey what you
think my battles are doing?

633
01:08:42,686 --> 01:08:45,293
Ten.
Maybe one or two, but ten, no.

634
01:08:48,429 --> 01:08:49,269
Hello?

635
01:08:51,337 --> 01:08:53,203
Come on man,
this shit ain't funny.

636
01:08:54,958 --> 01:08:56,479
What the hell is going on?

637
01:08:56,480 --> 01:08:57,637
I'm tripping man.

638
01:08:57,638 --> 01:08:59,682
It's probably some small ...  animal.

639
01:09:00,276 --> 01:09:02,713
A teenie tiny, squirrel, aren't you?

640
01:09:07,308 --> 01:09:08,688
Come on, Tommy man.

641
01:09:10,766 --> 01:09:13,560
Oh me, a grown man from Texas.
Get it together.

642
01:09:30,193 --> 01:09:33,226
Alright, Okay, I'm scared okay.
You win.

643
01:10:36,982 --> 01:10:39,859
Hey guys, Tommy's
been gone for a while.

644
01:10:39,860 --> 01:10:42,873
I'm going to go see if I could
find him.   I'll be right back.

645
01:10:45,231 --> 01:10:46,313
Tommy!

646
01:10:52,316 --> 01:10:53,016
Tommy!

647
01:11:03,647 --> 01:11:07,072
Tommy, if this is another
one of your jokes, stop now.

648
01:11:07,073 --> 01:11:08,674
I'm not in the mood.

649
01:11:10,717 --> 01:11:12,830
Tommy, I mean it, stop.

650
01:11:21,643 --> 01:11:26,279
Hey guys. He's not answering.
I'm getting really worried.

651
01:11:26,280 --> 01:11:31,261
I'm sure his fine, Maya. It's probably
just another one of his jokey jokes.

652
01:11:31,868 --> 01:11:36,378
And look, we're camping in
this farm under the full moon,

653
01:11:36,379 --> 01:11:37,963
this is perfect material for him.

654
01:11:38,416 --> 01:11:43,209
Yeah, he's right. He's fine.  Just
lay down. He'll be here in a second.

655
01:11:43,710 --> 01:11:47,251
Yeah, you're right.
He surprises being a critic.

656
01:11:54,508 --> 01:11:55,991
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

657
01:12:01,080 --> 01:12:02,145
Sorry.

658
01:12:04,429 --> 01:12:06,268
I don't know why you apologized?

659
01:12:06,969 --> 01:12:12,113
If it was up to me,
I'd be sleeping right here.

660
01:12:28,679 --> 01:12:30,266
Hey, I'm really worried.

661
01:12:30,267 --> 01:12:32,587
Something just
doesn't feel right.

662
01:12:34,237 --> 01:12:36,333
I'm going to see if
I could find him again.

663
01:12:36,334 --> 01:12:38,117
No.., I got him.

664
01:12:39,179 --> 01:12:43,429
I'll find him. Probably
constipating or something.

665
01:12:50,800 --> 01:12:51,871
Tommy!

666
01:12:53,489 --> 01:12:56,470
Come on Tommy, enough
is enough already, man.

667
01:13:00,704 --> 01:13:02,299
You gonna make
me come find you.

668
01:13:05,539 --> 01:13:07,225
That's a long shit, Tommy.

669
01:13:08,720 --> 01:13:12,287
I just wish sometimes he'll grow
the hell up. You know what I mean?

670
01:13:13,235 --> 01:13:19,099
Tommy is Tommy. He is always
been this way. You always love him.

671
01:13:19,200 --> 01:13:23,529
Love him, yes. But love
him right now? Hell no.

672
01:13:26,367 --> 01:13:29,243
Tommy, come on, man.
This is stupid.

673
01:13:31,902 --> 01:13:33,085
I hate you, Tom.

674
01:13:40,242 --> 01:13:41,170
Tommy!

675
01:14:00,986 --> 01:14:04,406
Tommy! Tommy!
Fuck!

676
01:14:21,561 --> 01:14:22,873
What was that?
Was it Dave?

677
01:14:23,674 --> 01:14:25,814
He's been gone now for 20 minutes.

678
01:14:26,621 --> 01:14:27,914
I'm gonna see him.

679
01:14:27,915 --> 01:14:32,321
No. You're not leaving me in
here alone. I'm not going out there.

680
01:14:32,355 --> 01:14:37,699
Well seriously, I'm sure
that everything is fine, I mean,

681
01:14:37,734 --> 01:14:41,398
Tommy probably just talked Dave into
one of his little pranks or something.

682
01:14:41,499 --> 01:14:45,709
No. Something is wrong, Jen.
Very, very wrong.

683
01:14:45,910 --> 01:14:50,537
- I'm scared.
- Okay, just take a deep breath.

684
01:14:51,238 --> 01:14:55,247
And, I'm sure everything gonna be fine.

685
01:14:55,748 --> 01:14:59,327
And I'll go out there and I'll
check and I'll be right back.

686
01:14:59,328 --> 01:15:04,274
I know. It's no.
Don't go out there. Please.

687
01:15:06,864 --> 01:15:08,224
What are you doing?

688
01:15:08,225 --> 01:15:13,030
Looking for something to use as a weapon.
Shit, we don't have anything.

689
01:15:16,983 --> 01:15:18,282
What is that?

690
01:15:19,192 --> 01:15:20,411
Shhh.

691
01:15:22,853 --> 01:15:26,251
- Oh my God!
- Shhhh.

692
01:15:28,056 --> 01:15:31,055
Don't move, ......

693
01:15:34,596 --> 01:15:35,805
What do you mean?

694
01:15:38,563 --> 01:15:43,385
I think it's a bear.
We have to stay quite still.

695
01:15:43,640 --> 01:15:46,194
After a while it
would just go away ...

696
01:15:46,913 --> 01:15:49,918
Well, it came looking
for me, remember?

697
01:15:55,313 --> 01:15:56,960
Oh my God!
I'm scared.

698
01:15:57,348 --> 01:16:00,678
Shhhh..
You gotta stay quiet.

699
01:16:02,221 --> 01:16:04,836
Okay.
Shhhh.

700
01:16:48,394 --> 01:16:52,118
Where the hell is the boat?
Where's the boat?

701
01:16:56,451 --> 01:16:57,667
Maya, run.

702
01:16:58,898 --> 01:17:00,062
Run!

703
01:17:34,216 --> 01:17:36,209
Tommy!

704
01:17:48,415 --> 01:17:51,234
Maya, we have to go now.
We can't stay here.

705
01:17:51,235 --> 01:17:52,965
No, I can't leave.

706
01:17:56,133 --> 01:17:58,637
I know.  Listen to me,
you can't help him now.

707
01:17:59,238 --> 01:18:03,128
We can't help him now. We have to go.
We have to save ourselves.

708
01:18:05,158 --> 01:18:07,565
No, I can't.

709
01:18:08,055 --> 01:18:11,417
I'll help you away.
We can't stay here.

710
01:18:35,672 --> 01:18:40,708
Listen .. I need you to stay here.

711
01:18:40,709 --> 01:18:42,924
Whatever happens, you're
gonna be safe here, okay.

712
01:18:42,925 --> 01:18:45,170
We have to fix this ....

713
01:18:46,149 --> 01:18:48,260
Maya, look at me.

714
01:18:48,903 --> 01:18:49,804
Trust me.

715
01:19:38,961 --> 01:19:42,653
Come on Jen!
Help! No, no....

716
01:19:43,836 --> 01:19:46,879
Listen, listen to me.
You can't help her now.

717
01:19:47,739 --> 01:19:50,169
You gotta run to the highway.

718
01:19:50,370 --> 01:19:54,792
Listen. Damn it.
Jen, you run!

719
01:19:55,927 --> 01:19:58,420
Now.
Get moving.

720
01:20:38,603 --> 01:20:41,974
Come on...
Come on ...

721
01:20:43,518 --> 01:20:45,462
I need help, I need
you to call somebody.

722
01:20:45,463 --> 01:20:48,085
I need help. Something ...
Something is chasing me.

723
01:20:49,587 --> 01:20:50,486
Mom?

724
01:20:51,900 --> 01:20:52,952
Mom.

725
01:21:03,602 --> 01:21:08,138
Come on. Come on...
No...
