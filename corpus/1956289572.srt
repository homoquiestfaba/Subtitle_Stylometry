happen to me once.

I think everyone
gets to have one,

mine for anything.

No, of course I'm sure.

more after surgery.

know what they're doing.

because I work in a hospital,

170

doctors don't know what they're

doing, so I'm just
gonna go talk to them.

some information.

will be right back.

00:12:49,336 --> 00:12:50,970
I don't date GIs.

187
00:12:50,971 --> 00:12:51,837
Yet.

188
00:12:51,838 --> 00:12:52,471
Ever.

189
00:12:52,472 --> 00:12:53,305
Until.

190
00:12:53,306 --> 00:12:54,240
It's not gonna happen.

191
00:12:54,241 --> 00:12:55,841
You say that now.

192
00:12:55,842 --> 00:12:58,276
Do you want the corn or not.

193
00:12:59,412 --> 00:13:00,513
Yes.

194
00:13:00,514 --> 00:13:02,080
Yes I do.

195
00:13:09,523 --> 00:13:11,157
[giggles] What?

196
00:13:11,158 --> 00:13:13,525
Oh, he wants a hair net.

197
00:13:23,570 --> 00:13:25,203
JULIE: We're breaking for lunch.

198
00:13:27,474 --> 00:13:30,141
So I'm going out with
that guy Robbie on Friday.

199
00:13:30,377 --> 00:13:32,011
The tall one?
The air man?

200
00:13:32,012 --> 00:13:33,278
Yes.

201
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:35,514
Speaking of airmen.

202
00:13:35,515 --> 00:13:37,249
Don't start with that.

203
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:39,185
He's so cute,
and Robbie knows him.

204
00:13:39,186 --> 00:13:40,853
He says he's a good guy.

205
00:13:40,854 --> 00:13:42,988
Seriously, what's your problem.

206
00:13:42,989 --> 00:13:44,857
My father won't approve.

207
00:13:44,858 --> 00:13:46,926
I'm not asking
you to marry him.

208
00:13:46,927 --> 00:13:48,393
Do you think he's cute.

209
00:13:49,129 --> 00:13:50,429
I think he's trouble.

210
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:51,597
Yes or no.

211
00:13:51,598 --> 00:13:57,236
Some people might say he's
handsome in the right light

212
00:13:57,237 --> 00:13:58,838
when he's in uniform.

213
00:13:58,839 --> 00:14:00,206
So you do
think he's cute.

214
00:14:00,207 --> 00:14:03,909
Okay, fine yes, I think
he's somewhat cute, Okay?

215
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:05,945
So then your father
doesn't have to know.

216
00:14:05,946 --> 00:14:07,179
You don't get it.

217
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:08,948
He said if he
catches me dating a GI,

218
00:14:08,949 --> 00:14:11,150
he'll send me to live
with my grandma in Nebraska.

219
00:14:11,151 --> 00:14:13,918
Well, do you want
to go to Nebraska?

220
00:14:14,354 --> 00:14:15,621
No.

221
00:14:15,622 --> 00:14:18,023
Then I guess we'll
have to keep it a secret.

222
00:14:18,024 --> 00:14:20,458
I guess I can
always meet another boy.

223
00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:25,230
Hey, I found your doctor.

224
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,066
And?

225
00:14:29,135 --> 00:14:32,438
And, dad's still in surgery.

226
00:14:32,439 --> 00:14:34,106
Still.

227
00:14:34,107 --> 00:14:36,008
Is that a bad thing?

228
00:14:36,009 --> 00:14:38,042
MICHELE: It's not a good thing.

229
00:14:51,524 --> 00:14:53,391
I heard you wanted
to go out with me.

230
00:14:59,266 --> 00:15:01,133
Oh look at that.

231
00:15:01,134 --> 00:15:03,268
We need more baked beans.

232
00:15:07,641 --> 00:15:09,073
I really
like your hair.

233
00:15:11,444 --> 00:15:13,044
Will you go out with me?

234
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:14,546
Squash?

235
00:15:14,547 --> 00:15:16,080
Sure.

236
00:15:16,683 --> 00:15:18,050
Apple sauce?

237
00:15:18,051 --> 00:15:20,119
Can I serve you some food?

238
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:21,253
No.

239
00:15:21,254 --> 00:15:24,355
Okay then,
I'll see you Monday.

240
00:15:33,333 --> 00:15:34,999
You can see him now.

241
00:15:35,502 --> 00:15:38,369
He's still sedated from surgery.

242
00:15:39,139 --> 00:15:40,271
Just...

243
00:15:41,408 --> 00:15:42,941
Just what?

244
00:15:43,476 --> 00:15:45,277
Just be prepared.

245
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:47,512
[machines beeping]

246
00:15:49,015 --> 00:15:51,249
[sobbing]

247
00:15:59,159 --> 00:16:01,392
You know, it's very likely
that he can hear you.

248
00:16:02,295 --> 00:16:05,029
Is he okay?
What's gonna happen?

249
00:16:05,398 --> 00:16:07,399
DOCTOR: I'll give you
a few more moments,

250
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:09,000
then we should
just let him rest.

251
00:16:17,344 --> 00:16:19,143
You're gonna be okay.

252
00:16:29,222 --> 00:16:32,190
[upbeat music]

253
00:16:36,296 --> 00:16:38,096
Can I take
you to the movies?

254
00:16:38,365 --> 00:16:39,597
No.

255
00:16:45,405 --> 00:16:46,739
What are you doing Monday?

256
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:48,006
Washing my hair.

257
00:16:52,145 --> 00:16:52,745
Go for a walk?

258
00:16:52,746 --> 00:16:53,778
No.

259
00:16:55,448 --> 00:16:56,548
Your eyes are beautiful.

260
00:16:56,549 --> 00:16:57,715
Not a chance.

261
00:16:59,686 --> 00:17:00,586
Thursday?

262
00:17:00,587 --> 00:17:02,286
Washing my hair again.

263
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:04,423
Friday?

264
00:17:04,424 --> 00:17:05,723
Doing laundry.

265
00:17:11,798 --> 00:17:12,798
Do you like me?

266
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:13,799
Nope.

267
00:17:17,037 --> 00:17:18,669
Sunday.

268
00:17:20,673 --> 00:17:21,706
Maybe.

269
00:17:22,542 --> 00:17:24,575
Maybe is better than a no.

270
00:17:29,416 --> 00:17:32,117
MICHELE: So where are
we at post-surgery?

271
00:17:32,118 --> 00:17:35,120
Well, the medication is
keeping his heart going.

272
00:17:35,121 --> 00:17:37,121
Breathing on a respirator.

273
00:17:38,391 --> 00:17:40,359
I mean, his mind is still there.

274
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:41,760
He's conscious.

275
00:17:41,761 --> 00:17:47,732
But he's paralyzed, and his
body's failing him everywhere.

276
00:17:49,769 --> 00:17:52,303
So, what happens next?

277
00:17:54,307 --> 00:17:56,575
We have some
tough decisions to make

278
00:17:56,576 --> 00:17:58,743
and he's only getting worse.

279
00:18:02,148 --> 00:18:04,450
Could you just give
us a few minutes to talk

280
00:18:04,451 --> 00:18:05,751
about it privately?

281
00:18:05,752 --> 00:18:07,618
Of course, of course.

282
00:18:13,827 --> 00:18:15,828
So he's gonna be
in a wheelchair, right?

283
00:18:15,829 --> 00:18:17,612
Mom.

284
00:18:17,613 --> 00:18:19,396
JAN: I'll learn to
take care of him.

285
00:18:20,433 --> 00:18:22,334
We have a one-story house.

286
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:24,870
There are no stairs, we have a
walk-in shower already, we can

287
00:18:24,871 --> 00:18:27,639
make the whole place wheelchair
accessible, we can put a ramp.

288
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:29,341
Thought I'd just-

289
00:18:29,342 --> 00:18:30,475
Mom.
Mom.

290
00:18:30,844 --> 00:18:32,211
What?

291
00:18:32,212 --> 00:18:34,580
I don't think you're
understanding.

292
00:18:34,581 --> 00:18:36,414
What am I not
understanding?

293
00:18:38,218 --> 00:18:39,817
You're scaring her.

294
00:18:40,854 --> 00:18:44,389
Okay, I just don't
think that you're hearing

295
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:47,492
maybe what's actually happening.

296
00:18:49,696 --> 00:18:51,829
Dad isn't breathing on his own.

297
00:18:54,167 --> 00:18:57,269
His heart isn't
beating on its own, Okay?

298
00:18:57,270 --> 00:19:01,673
And so this is not just take
him home and buy a wheelchair.

299
00:19:01,674 --> 00:19:04,375
This is much more
serious than that.

300
00:19:05,178 --> 00:19:07,712
I heard what the doctor
said, I was listening.

301
00:19:08,448 --> 00:19:10,149
But he could improve.

302
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:12,450
It's just not likely.

303
00:19:14,154 --> 00:19:16,755
Miracles can happen.
I should be in a hospital

304
00:19:16,756 --> 00:19:19,891
bed myself right now,
I should be, and I'm not.

305
00:19:20,894 --> 00:19:23,529
God kept me alive for a reason.

306
00:19:23,530 --> 00:19:26,197
We need to be praying for
your father right now.

307
00:19:27,433 --> 00:19:28,567
Mom, I'll pray with you.

308
00:19:28,568 --> 00:19:30,301
Okay, you're not helping her.

309
00:19:31,504 --> 00:19:34,605
I'm sorry, but a miracle
is not going to happen.

310
00:19:35,175 --> 00:19:36,375
Okay?

311
00:19:36,376 --> 00:19:39,311
He's just, he's not
going to get better.

312
00:19:39,312 --> 00:19:40,846
What happened to you?

313
00:19:40,847 --> 00:19:45,517
I'm just-I'm just trying to
be the grown-up at the table.

314
00:19:45,518 --> 00:19:47,419
Okay?

315
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:51,590
Look, you can pray, and you
should, but all I want you to

316
00:19:51,591 --> 00:19:54,193
know is that praying
is not going to change a

317
00:19:54,194 --> 00:19:56,862
medical diagnosis, Okay?

318
00:19:56,863 --> 00:19:59,198
And I'd think a lawyer
should understand that!

319
00:19:59,199 --> 00:20:01,866
And I would expect you to
remember where we came from.

320
00:20:02,702 --> 00:20:04,735
JAN: Okay, girls.

321
00:20:09,542 --> 00:20:10,776
Sweetie.

322
00:20:10,777 --> 00:20:12,544
I know you're scared.

323
00:20:12,545 --> 00:20:13,878
It's okay.

324
00:20:15,748 --> 00:20:19,250
We have to place our faith in
God to watch over your father.

325
00:20:21,988 --> 00:20:23,554
You know that.

326
00:20:36,569 --> 00:20:38,470
Where are you going, young lady?

327
00:20:38,471 --> 00:20:40,339
I'm going to the
movies with Julie.

328
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:41,373
I told mom.

329
00:20:41,374 --> 00:20:42,374
Mm-hmm.

330
00:20:43,243 --> 00:20:45,243
Alright, back before 10:00.

331
00:20:46,312 --> 00:20:47,379
I will.

332
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:48,714
Just you and Julie, hm?

333
00:20:48,715 --> 00:20:49,915
JAN: Yes.

334
00:20:49,916 --> 00:20:52,317
You don't have to
interrogate her, honey.

335
00:20:52,318 --> 00:20:53,652
You sure?

336
00:20:53,653 --> 00:20:55,853
MARION: She wouldn't lie to us.

337
00:20:57,357 --> 00:20:58,956
I'll be back before 10:00.

338
00:21:00,326 --> 00:21:01,559
Alright.

339
00:21:03,463 --> 00:21:04,663
[door closes]

340
00:21:04,664 --> 00:21:06,030
Relax.

341
00:21:09,736 --> 00:21:11,436
What if he
tries to kiss you?

342
00:21:11,437 --> 00:21:12,904
I'm not gonna let him.

343
00:21:12,905 --> 00:21:15,340
Robbie kissed me
on our first date.

344
00:21:15,341 --> 00:21:16,741
That's because you're easy.

345
00:21:18,811 --> 00:21:21,446
I'm only doing this because
you pushed me into it.

346
00:21:21,447 --> 00:21:23,982
That's what you
need to tell yourself.

347
00:21:23,983 --> 00:21:26,652
By the end of the night I'm
gonna have to pull you off him.

348
00:21:26,653 --> 00:21:27,653
Not a chance.

349
00:21:27,654 --> 00:21:28,720
[chuckling]

350
00:21:28,721 --> 00:21:30,488
[music playing]

351
00:21:31,491 --> 00:21:32,590
Hi boys.

352
00:21:32,825 --> 00:21:34,058
Hey, girls.

353
00:21:48,841 --> 00:21:50,041
Should we go?

354
00:21:51,811 --> 00:21:53,979
I actually really
don't wanna see a movie.

355
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:56,447
I'd rather just hang and talk.

356
00:21:57,950 --> 00:21:59,483
If that's okay.

357
00:22:00,053 --> 00:22:02,086
I'd love to
just sit and talk.

358
00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:05,390
Okay then.

359
00:22:05,391 --> 00:22:06,590
You two coming?

360
00:22:08,528 --> 00:22:09,795
You go ahead.

361
00:22:09,796 --> 00:22:11,763
Alright, you two have fun.

362
00:22:11,764 --> 00:22:13,030
[laughs]

363
00:22:17,003 --> 00:22:18,903
There's a little
park down this way.

364
00:22:28,681 --> 00:22:29,715
So.
You...

365
00:22:29,716 --> 00:22:31,382
I'm not making out with you.

366
00:22:33,453 --> 00:22:35,487
Who said you were?

367
00:22:35,488 --> 00:22:37,756
I know what "just sit
and talk," means to boys.

368
00:22:37,757 --> 00:22:39,791
No, not me.

369
00:22:39,792 --> 00:22:41,926
I just wanna get to know you.

370
00:22:45,098 --> 00:22:46,898
I hope you don't get into
trouble for sneaking

371
00:22:46,899 --> 00:22:48,733
out to see me like this.

372
00:22:49,102 --> 00:22:50,635
Robbie told me.

373
00:22:50,636 --> 00:22:52,036
It'll be fine.

374
00:22:54,507 --> 00:22:55,741
Look.

375
00:22:55,742 --> 00:22:58,410
I just think you're
beautiful, and cute.

376
00:22:58,411 --> 00:23:00,779
And I just wanna
spend time with you.

377
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:02,012
Is that so awful?

378
00:23:03,116 --> 00:23:04,615
No, it's not.

379
00:23:08,988 --> 00:23:11,005
Good.

380
00:23:11,006 --> 00:23:13,023
It's just that my dad
used to train recruits.

381
00:23:14,127 --> 00:23:17,094
He told me what GIs were like.

382
00:23:17,797 --> 00:23:20,114
He's not wrong.

383
00:23:20,115 --> 00:23:22,435
There are a lot of guys who
don't know how to treat a lady.

384
00:23:23,736 --> 00:23:26,670
But I'm not one of those guys.

385
00:23:35,782 --> 00:23:37,716
So, Jan.

386
00:23:37,717 --> 00:23:39,150
What's your story?

387
00:23:39,886 --> 00:23:41,887
Unless you plan on being
a career lunch lady.

388
00:23:41,888 --> 00:23:43,655
No.

389
00:23:43,656 --> 00:23:45,824
I wanna go to college.

390
00:23:45,825 --> 00:23:47,758
I want a real career.

391
00:23:48,561 --> 00:23:50,828
But my parents always
say I'm just a girl.

392
00:23:51,731 --> 00:23:53,497
They actually say that?

393
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,534
Yeah.

394
00:23:55,535 --> 00:23:56,901
My mom says it a lot.

395
00:23:58,037 --> 00:24:00,938
Well, you're
not just a girl to me.

396
00:24:05,812 --> 00:24:09,079
My mom, we have some
things we disagree on, too.

397
00:24:10,550 --> 00:24:12,784
That's sort of why I
joined the Air Force.

398
00:24:12,785 --> 00:24:14,151
To get away?

399
00:24:15,021 --> 00:24:16,620
Maybe.

400
00:24:17,757 --> 00:24:19,124
Do you like it?

401
00:24:19,125 --> 00:24:20,992
I do.

402
00:24:20,993 --> 00:24:22,994
It's not like back home.

403
00:24:22,995 --> 00:24:25,831
If you say you're gonna
do something, you do it.

404
00:24:25,832 --> 00:24:29,034
People are responsible for
their actions, no accountable.

405
00:24:29,035 --> 00:24:31,202
That's why I like it.

406
00:24:32,171 --> 00:24:33,838
You sound like my dad.

407
00:24:35,208 --> 00:24:36,608
Sorry?

408
00:24:36,609 --> 00:24:38,242
That's not always a bad thing.

409
00:24:40,646 --> 00:24:41,947
Oh, shoot, what time is it?

410
00:24:41,948 --> 00:24:43,548
Why?

411
00:24:43,549 --> 00:24:46,951
I promised my
dad I'd be home early.

412
00:24:49,188 --> 00:24:50,855
I have a question.

413
00:24:51,991 --> 00:24:53,724
Please don't lie to me.

414
00:24:54,494 --> 00:24:55,759
Okay.

415
00:24:57,797 --> 00:24:59,231
Do you have a girlfriend?

416
00:24:59,232 --> 00:25:00,799
What?

417
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:03,201
Where did that come from?

418
00:25:03,202 --> 00:25:05,837
Some guys think it's okay
to talk to more than one girl

419
00:25:05,838 --> 00:25:07,104
at a time.

420
00:25:08,274 --> 00:25:10,174
I'm not one of those guys.

421
00:25:11,878 --> 00:25:14,812
You are the only girl
I wanna be talking to.

422
00:25:19,952 --> 00:25:21,653
ROBBIE: Last call, Romeo.

423
00:25:21,654 --> 00:25:23,021
Robbie!

424
00:25:23,022 --> 00:25:24,522
[Robbie laughs]

425
00:25:25,191 --> 00:25:26,658
JULIE: Sorry.

426
00:25:26,659 --> 00:25:28,894
We really do have
to go though, Jan.

427
00:25:28,895 --> 00:25:30,962
We're already late, my mom
will be waiting up for me.

428
00:25:30,963 --> 00:25:33,031
JAN: Why didn't you
come get me sooner?

429
00:25:33,032 --> 00:25:36,034
Robbie and I-talked-a
little in the theater after

430
00:25:36,035 --> 00:25:37,568
the movie finished.

431
00:25:39,605 --> 00:25:41,705
Yeah, we had a really
nice-talk in there.

432
00:25:42,975 --> 00:25:45,776
Seems like you two were
about to talk, too.

433
00:25:46,312 --> 00:25:47,645
Bye.

434
00:25:48,314 --> 00:25:49,847
Can I call you sometime?

435
00:25:50,983 --> 00:25:52,116
Okay.

436
00:25:52,852 --> 00:25:54,051
ROBBIE: Later, babe.

437
00:25:59,025 --> 00:26:00,324
JULIE: Come on.

438
00:26:01,861 --> 00:26:04,061
Sorry man, I tried
to stall her for you.

439
00:26:05,565 --> 00:26:07,331
Jan, wait a second.
Wait a second.

440
00:26:12,838 --> 00:26:14,071
[kiss]

441
00:26:16,342 --> 00:26:17,841
Bye.

442
00:26:18,010 --> 00:26:19,076
Bye.

443
00:26:20,813 --> 00:26:22,780
[giggling]

444
00:26:23,049 --> 00:26:24,950
Yeah! Good one.

445
00:26:24,951 --> 00:26:26,318
Yeah.

446
00:26:26,319 --> 00:26:27,785
Come on.

447
00:26:29,589 --> 00:26:31,689
Nice one, dude! You did it!

448
00:26:32,224 --> 00:26:33,791
STEVE: Get out of here.

449
00:26:40,766 --> 00:26:43,134
DOCTOR: He's awake,
and responsive.

450
00:26:43,135 --> 00:26:44,703
That's great!

451
00:26:44,704 --> 00:26:47,038
I told you God
was watching after him.

452
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:49,074
The sedative wore off, mom.

453
00:26:49,075 --> 00:26:51,910
Can you please just try
to be a little upbeat?

454
00:26:51,911 --> 00:26:53,677
I'm just saying,
that's why he's awake.

455
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:56,114
Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey,
what are you doing?

456
00:26:56,115 --> 00:26:57,882
No, no, no.

457
00:26:57,883 --> 00:26:59,767
You have a strained shoulder,
you have to put that back on.

458
00:26:59,768 --> 00:27:01,653
I don't want your
father worrying about me.

459
00:27:01,654 --> 00:27:03,755
There's a reason they told you
to wear it in the first place,

460
00:27:03,756 --> 00:27:05,623
I mean he's not...
Okay.

461
00:27:06,692 --> 00:27:08,412
Come on, let's go see
him. Here, I got this.

462
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:16,166
Hey there.

463
00:27:21,107 --> 00:27:22,272
TERRI: Dad.

464
00:27:25,778 --> 00:27:27,044
Daddy.

465
00:27:30,716 --> 00:27:32,850
MICHELE: Mom, he
can't feel his arms.

466
00:27:34,253 --> 00:27:37,655
But if you wanted
to touch him on his face,

467
00:27:39,058 --> 00:27:41,258
above his chin,
he can feel there.

468
00:27:48,034 --> 00:27:49,233
I'm here.

469
00:27:53,205 --> 00:27:54,371
TERRI: You look good.

470
00:27:55,708 --> 00:27:58,109
We have been
praying for you non-stop.

471
00:27:58,110 --> 00:28:00,244
God is protecting you.

472
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:10,120
Sweetheart, I love you.

473
00:28:16,128 --> 00:28:17,395
Now who's easy?

474
00:28:17,396 --> 00:28:19,164
Stop it.

475
00:28:19,165 --> 00:28:20,605
I thought you
weren't gonna kiss him.

476
00:28:21,367 --> 00:28:23,001
He's not like the others.

477
00:28:23,002 --> 00:28:24,936
Why, because
he told you so?

478
00:28:24,937 --> 00:28:27,205
It's not that he told me,

479
00:28:27,206 --> 00:28:29,473
it's how he looked
at me when he said it.

480
00:28:31,444 --> 00:28:33,410
I don't know, I
can't explain it.

481
00:28:34,413 --> 00:28:39,016
Something about the way he
looks at me, I understand him.

482
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:43,353
I think you're
gonna see him again.

483
00:28:44,056 --> 00:28:45,789
I might.

484
00:28:57,303 --> 00:28:59,170
We had a really good
time at the movies.

485
00:28:59,171 --> 00:29:01,172
We got ice cream after.

486
00:29:01,173 --> 00:29:02,907
Well it's almost 11:00.

487
00:29:02,908 --> 00:29:04,908
It was really
good ice cream.

488
00:29:05,277 --> 00:29:06,477
Really good.

489
00:29:07,012 --> 00:29:08,146
Okay.

490
00:29:08,147 --> 00:29:09,480
Good night.

491
00:29:13,319 --> 00:29:15,920
I looked like that
after our first date.

492
00:29:15,921 --> 00:29:17,054
Yeah.

493
00:29:17,456 --> 00:29:19,256
That's what worries me.

494
00:29:19,792 --> 00:29:21,225
[laughs]

495
00:29:22,261 --> 00:29:23,994
Relax.

496
00:29:31,871 --> 00:29:33,170
Delicious.

497
00:29:33,539 --> 00:29:34,938
Thank you, darling.

498
00:29:36,976 --> 00:29:39,977
I wanna have a friend
come eat with us sometime.

499
00:29:40,513 --> 00:29:41,780
Of course.

500
00:29:41,781 --> 00:29:42,980
Which friend?

501
00:29:44,283 --> 00:29:45,849
He's a college student.

502
00:29:48,053 --> 00:29:49,820
A college student you're dating?

503
00:29:49,989 --> 00:29:51,022
No.

504
00:29:51,023 --> 00:29:53,090
No, he's just a good friend.

505
00:29:55,027 --> 00:29:57,044
Right.

506
00:29:57,045 --> 00:29:59,063
We think it's great you want
your friends to come meet us

507
00:29:59,064 --> 00:30:01,465
honey, he's welcome anytime.

508
00:30:04,069 --> 00:30:05,202
Great.

509
00:30:07,473 --> 00:30:08,539
Great.

510
00:30:12,845 --> 00:30:15,847
Thank you Lord for these
gifts we are about to receive

511
00:30:15,848 --> 00:30:17,081
from your bounty.

512
00:30:17,082 --> 00:30:19,383
In Jesus' name, amen.

513
00:30:19,552 --> 00:30:20,185
MARION: Amen.

514
00:30:20,186 --> 00:30:20,885
JIM: Amen.

515
00:30:20,886 --> 00:30:22,019
Amen.

516
00:30:23,189 --> 00:30:25,289
JIM: Alright, Steve.

517
00:30:26,425 --> 00:30:29,026
Couldn't help but
notice your haircut.

518
00:30:29,829 --> 00:30:31,094
High and tight.

519
00:30:31,463 --> 00:30:32,896
I like keeping it short.

520
00:30:34,099 --> 00:30:35,199
Right.

521
00:30:38,304 --> 00:30:40,470
So, Steve,
where are you from?

522
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:41,940
Los Angeles.

523
00:30:42,141 --> 00:30:43,942
Oh, we know lots
of people there.

524
00:30:43,943 --> 00:30:45,175
Where did you live?

525
00:30:45,911 --> 00:30:46,944
Brentwood.

526
00:30:47,379 --> 00:30:49,180
Mm-hmm. You a rich kid?

527
00:30:49,181 --> 00:30:51,148
STEVE: No, uhm,

528
00:30:51,550 --> 00:30:53,450
everything there
was my dad's, not mine.

529
00:30:54,553 --> 00:30:56,386
It's all gone now anyway.

530
00:30:57,423 --> 00:30:59,122
What, he blow it all?

531
00:31:00,192 --> 00:31:01,525
It's a long story.

532
00:31:03,462 --> 00:31:05,096
What about you?

533
00:31:05,097 --> 00:31:06,364
You have a job?

534
00:31:06,365 --> 00:31:07,899
Uhh...

535
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:09,267
He's a college student.

536
00:31:09,268 --> 00:31:10,535
I told you that.

537
00:31:10,536 --> 00:31:12,035
Yes you did.

538
00:31:13,138 --> 00:31:15,173
And how did you two meet?

539
00:31:15,174 --> 00:31:16,307
STEVE: Well, we...

540
00:31:16,308 --> 00:31:18,208
He hangs out at
the ice cream parlor.

541
00:31:19,144 --> 00:31:21,045
JIM: Well, Steve,
I guess you can go home.

542
00:31:21,046 --> 00:31:23,146
Seems like Jan has all
the answers for you.

543
00:31:24,550 --> 00:31:26,016
She's a good listener.

544
00:31:30,322 --> 00:31:32,122
Steve might
tutor me in math.

545
00:31:33,325 --> 00:31:35,126
Why would he do that?

546
00:31:35,127 --> 00:31:37,095
So I can be
ready for college math.

547
00:31:37,096 --> 00:31:38,563
Oh, honey.

548
00:31:38,564 --> 00:31:40,564
Secretaries don't need math.

549
00:31:41,667 --> 00:31:45,035
Well maybe I don't
wanna be just a secretary.

550
00:31:45,604 --> 00:31:47,005
I see.

551
00:31:47,006 --> 00:31:50,575
So your mommy's job isn't
good enough for you,

552
00:31:50,576 --> 00:31:52,175
is that what you're saying?

553
00:31:52,444 --> 00:31:53,611
Never mind.

554
00:31:53,612 --> 00:31:55,646
This pot roast is
excellent, Mrs. Nichols.

555
00:31:58,183 --> 00:31:59,684
Thank you Steve.

556
00:31:59,685 --> 00:32:01,084
You're welcome.

557
00:32:11,196 --> 00:32:12,563
STEVE: Thank you so much.

558
00:32:12,564 --> 00:32:13,965
I'd be happy to clean up.

559
00:32:13,966 --> 00:32:15,233
Oh, don't be silly.

560
00:32:15,234 --> 00:32:17,068
No, that's
very kind of him.

561
00:32:17,069 --> 00:32:17,702
Go on, then.

562
00:32:17,703 --> 00:32:19,537
Jim!

563
00:32:19,538 --> 00:32:22,018
Well boy just got a free meal,
least he could do is the dishes.

564
00:32:23,075 --> 00:32:24,441
STEVE: I'd be happy to.

565
00:32:25,010 --> 00:32:26,410
JIM: Hop on it son.
Here you go.

566
00:32:29,381 --> 00:32:32,349
Hey, while you're at it, you
wanna give her a fill up there?

567
00:32:33,052 --> 00:32:34,052
Dad.

568
00:32:35,054 --> 00:32:35,954
Sure.

569
00:32:35,955 --> 00:32:37,120
Thank you.

570
00:32:41,427 --> 00:32:42,592
Too much.

571
00:32:48,233 --> 00:32:50,601
He seemed in
good spirits today.

572
00:32:50,602 --> 00:32:54,304
That's great, but unfortunately
medically, he's not improving.

573
00:32:56,375 --> 00:32:58,275
Does Steve have a living will?

574
00:33:01,347 --> 00:33:04,015
Why do they call it living
when it's only about dying?

575
00:33:04,016 --> 00:33:05,083
DOCTOR: But does he have one?

576
00:33:05,084 --> 00:33:06,184
JAN: Yeah.

577
00:33:06,185 --> 00:33:07,651
Who has power of attorney?

578
00:33:08,454 --> 00:33:09,987
JAN: I do.

579
00:33:10,422 --> 00:33:12,289
What would he want you to do?

580
00:33:13,425 --> 00:33:16,560
He'd wanna be given
every chance to live.

581
00:33:18,697 --> 00:33:20,731
To be here for his girls.

582
00:33:22,267 --> 00:33:24,769
He can react to us, I mean
that has to mean something,

583
00:33:24,770 --> 00:33:26,137
surely, doesn't it?

584
00:33:26,138 --> 00:33:27,771
Unfortunately it doesn't.

585
00:33:28,374 --> 00:33:31,274
But what if
there is any chance?

586
00:33:35,547 --> 00:33:37,331
And if there's not?

587
00:33:37,332 --> 00:33:39,417
The hospital would recommend
moving him to hospice.

588
00:33:39,418 --> 00:33:40,752
Why do we have to move him?

589
00:33:40,753 --> 00:33:42,473
He's been through enough
already, hasn't he?

590
00:33:43,188 --> 00:33:45,256
Ma'am, hospice is for...

591
00:33:45,257 --> 00:33:46,424
I know.
I know.

592
00:33:46,425 --> 00:33:48,059
I know what hospice is.

593
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:49,694
My husband is not a
piece of furniture.

594
00:33:49,695 --> 00:33:51,229
Of course not.

595
00:33:51,230 --> 00:33:53,264
JAN: I feel like you
just want me to kill him...

596
00:33:53,265 --> 00:33:54,565
No, mom, no.

597
00:33:54,566 --> 00:33:55,533
JAN: Like you want me to
shut off the machines

598
00:33:55,534 --> 00:33:56,467
and the medicine.

599
00:33:56,468 --> 00:33:58,236
Mom.

600
00:33:58,237 --> 00:34:00,304
DOCTOR: I don't want you to
do anything you don't want to.

601
00:34:00,305 --> 00:34:02,373
But the fact of the matter is no
matter how well we take care of

602
00:34:02,374 --> 00:34:05,609
him, he'll never be able
to function on his own.

603
00:34:06,678 --> 00:34:08,478
He hates hospitals.

604
00:34:09,381 --> 00:34:11,048
He always has.

605
00:34:12,785 --> 00:34:15,520
We don't have to
discuss this now,

606
00:34:15,521 --> 00:34:18,089
but we do have to
make a decision.

607
00:34:18,090 --> 00:34:19,557
JAN: You can talk to me doctor.

608
00:34:19,558 --> 00:34:22,293
As I said, I have power of
attorney, and I will decide

609
00:34:22,294 --> 00:34:23,795
what happens to my husband.

610
00:34:23,796 --> 00:34:24,828
Of course.

611
00:34:26,198 --> 00:34:27,798
I think we
need to be alone.

612
00:34:28,534 --> 00:34:31,234
DOCTOR: You know about a
year ago, I lost my wife.

613
00:34:33,172 --> 00:34:36,773
And I didn't listen when the
hospital recommended hospice.

614
00:34:38,410 --> 00:34:42,813
But if I could do it all over
again, I know what I would do.

615
00:34:49,721 --> 00:34:52,657
Look, we can explore a lot
of different options on

616
00:34:52,658 --> 00:34:54,792
how to do this transition.

617
00:34:54,793 --> 00:34:57,494
I think maybe you
were right, sweetheart.

618
00:35:00,232 --> 00:35:01,732
I've been fooling myself.

619
00:35:01,733 --> 00:35:03,800
God's not helping
us on this one.

620
00:35:05,404 --> 00:35:07,370
Good job, Michele.

621
00:35:08,707 --> 00:35:10,674
Well-I-Mom.

622
00:35:11,510 --> 00:35:14,277
Hey, I didn't mean to-

623
00:35:15,247 --> 00:35:16,513
I'm sorry.

624
00:35:23,255 --> 00:35:26,124
JAN: He's taking
one night class,

625
00:35:26,125 --> 00:35:27,724
so technically I'm not lying.

626
00:35:29,595 --> 00:35:32,363
You don't see the way
that he looks at him.

627
00:35:32,364 --> 00:35:34,198
It's like he hates him.

628
00:35:34,199 --> 00:35:35,366
PASTOR ROBERT: But you love him.

629
00:35:35,367 --> 00:35:39,270
I... Well, we've only
been dating for six months.

630
00:35:39,271 --> 00:35:41,505
Why, did I say that I love him?

631
00:35:41,907 --> 00:35:43,340
You didn't have to.

632
00:35:45,611 --> 00:35:47,244
I just-

633
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:50,648
I just want my
father to see him.

634
00:35:50,649 --> 00:35:54,618
Not the way that he thinks he
is, but the way that I see him.

635
00:35:57,923 --> 00:36:00,390
How long are you willing
to wait for that to happen?

636
00:36:01,293 --> 00:36:03,193
For as long as it takes.

637
00:36:05,764 --> 00:36:06,864
Then it will.

638
00:36:06,865 --> 00:36:10,600
But you'll struggle,
and you'll doubt it.

639
00:36:12,404 --> 00:36:15,205
Stay patient and eventually
you'll get there.

640
00:36:16,441 --> 00:36:17,707
How do you know that?

641
00:36:19,311 --> 00:36:20,711
I don't.

642
00:36:20,712 --> 00:36:22,746
I just have faith that it will.

643
00:36:27,853 --> 00:36:29,352
Let's pray.

644
00:36:32,624 --> 00:36:36,326
Heavenly Father, please be with
Jan in her time of trouble.

645
00:36:41,967 --> 00:36:43,501
Ehm-Mom?

646
00:36:43,502 --> 00:36:44,801
Someone's here to see you.

647
00:36:46,505 --> 00:36:49,206
PASTOR ROBERT: Well I guess I'll
just go back to California then.

648
00:36:50,475 --> 00:36:51,742
Who told you?

649
00:36:51,743 --> 00:36:52,877
Your daughter.

650
00:36:52,878 --> 00:36:53,945
JAN: Terri?

651
00:36:53,946 --> 00:36:54,978
No.

652
00:36:56,415 --> 00:36:58,216
MICHELE: Don't give
me too much credit,

653
00:36:58,217 --> 00:36:59,716
it was Terri's idea.

654
00:37:00,452 --> 00:37:02,586
I'm here to pray with you.

655
00:37:03,589 --> 00:37:06,289
I am sorry you traveled
so far to be with us.

656
00:37:06,658 --> 00:37:08,259
But God's not listening.

657
00:37:08,260 --> 00:37:09,793
God is always listening.

658
00:37:10,429 --> 00:37:11,796
No, He isn't.

659
00:37:11,797 --> 00:37:13,331
He isn't.

660
00:37:13,332 --> 00:37:14,932
I thought He did.

661
00:37:14,933 --> 00:37:17,634
But right now when we need
Him the most, He's not here.

662
00:37:18,270 --> 00:37:19,937
He's not listening to
what I have to say,

663
00:37:19,938 --> 00:37:21,504
He's stopped listening.

664
00:37:34,653 --> 00:37:36,519
Sorry I wasted your time.

665
00:37:36,989 --> 00:37:39,422
It's not a waste
for me to be here.

666
00:37:41,526 --> 00:37:43,960
Is there any reason you
chose to come in here?

667
00:37:48,367 --> 00:37:50,835
Just wanted to be
alone, I guess.

668
00:37:50,836 --> 00:37:53,004
Oh, well, I'll leave
you to it then.

669
00:37:53,005 --> 00:37:53,938
[sighs]

670
00:37:53,939 --> 00:37:56,406
No, sorry.

671
00:37:58,377 --> 00:37:59,743
Please stay.

672
00:38:00,345 --> 00:38:02,647
I got the feeling you're
not spending much time in

673
00:38:02,648 --> 00:38:03,847
chapels these days.

674
00:38:05,350 --> 00:38:07,384
MICHELE: No, I guess not.

675
00:38:07,753 --> 00:38:10,954
I'm not preaching to you,
it's just an observation.

676
00:38:13,325 --> 00:38:15,559
But it is a bit funny
though, you called me

677
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:17,360
and you coming here.

678
00:38:17,929 --> 00:38:20,330
There are other places
you could go to be alone.

679
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:23,600
It's just a
coincidence I suppose.

680
00:38:25,671 --> 00:38:27,070
Yeah, it is.

681
00:38:27,773 --> 00:38:30,308
You know, your mother's
been praying with me

682
00:38:30,309 --> 00:38:31,876
since she was young.

683
00:38:31,877 --> 00:38:34,344
I saw you when you were
just a little girl.

684
00:38:34,913 --> 00:38:36,946
I know you were
raised in church.

685
00:38:37,883 --> 00:38:41,452
And I also know you seem
to have a mind of your own,

686
00:38:41,453 --> 00:38:42,652
and that's a good thing.

687
00:38:44,656 --> 00:38:45,589
Yeah?

688
00:38:45,590 --> 00:38:46,857
Definitely.

689
00:38:46,858 --> 00:38:48,526
She does, too.

690
00:38:48,527 --> 00:38:50,461
Always did.

691
00:38:50,462 --> 00:38:52,429
You got that from her.

692
00:38:54,933 --> 00:38:58,469
But sometimes you get
preached something so much

693
00:38:58,470 --> 00:39:02,372
it feels good to make your
own decisions, and you should.

694
00:39:04,976 --> 00:39:06,776
I have.

695
00:39:07,913 --> 00:39:10,647
And it just feels safer to shut
out what you can't control.

696
00:39:11,483 --> 00:39:13,616
But that makes for a cold world.

697
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:17,821
And I think the world is
warm, and full of love.

698
00:39:18,857 --> 00:39:21,691
If we just open
ourselves up to it.

699
00:39:22,861 --> 00:39:25,529
I'm gonna pray for
your father now.

700
00:39:25,530 --> 00:39:27,965
You can just listen if you like.

701
00:39:27,966 --> 00:39:31,502
Father God, we ask
you in the name of Jesus,

702
00:39:31,503 --> 00:39:33,937
we ask you right now
Father, for a miracle.

703
00:39:35,407 --> 00:39:38,676
The Bible says that where two or
more are gathered in agreement

704
00:39:38,677 --> 00:39:41,111
on a thing, that thing
shall take place.

705
00:39:41,980 --> 00:39:44,582
So we ask you Father
right now for a miracle for

706
00:39:44,583 --> 00:39:46,549
our brother Steve.

707
00:39:47,052 --> 00:39:49,487
We ask that you bring comfort to
this family, to the hearts of

708
00:39:49,488 --> 00:39:51,689
those that love him.

709
00:39:51,690 --> 00:39:55,626
We ask, God, that you reveal
yourself to be God to those who

710
00:39:55,627 --> 00:39:59,463
doubt, and give strength
to those who feel weak.

711
00:39:59,464 --> 00:40:02,066
We know you are able, God.

712
00:40:02,067 --> 00:40:04,702
We know that you've made us
those promises, and God you are

713
00:40:04,703 --> 00:40:07,671
good at keeping your promises.

714
00:40:07,672 --> 00:40:10,975
I ask you God to put a
special hand of a blessing

715
00:40:10,976 --> 00:40:12,476
on this family.

716
00:40:12,477 --> 00:40:14,545
Give them comfort today, God.

717
00:40:14,546 --> 00:40:17,515
Give them freedom today, God.

718
00:40:17,516 --> 00:40:21,185
Give them the joy of knowing
that you have your hands around

719
00:40:21,186 --> 00:40:25,156
them dear Father, and that
you will not let them sink

720
00:40:25,157 --> 00:40:27,090
into despair.

721
00:40:27,793 --> 00:40:31,095
Today, God, we rejoice because
we will see a miracle.

722
00:40:31,096 --> 00:40:35,833
Today we rejoice because you
will manifest yourself as God.

723
00:40:35,834 --> 00:40:38,836
I thank you God for
leading me here.

724
00:40:38,837 --> 00:40:41,105
I thank you for this family.

725
00:40:41,106 --> 00:40:45,708
I thank you for faith, but most
of all, I thank you for you.

726
00:40:46,645 --> 00:40:50,014
In the name of our Lord
and Savior Jesus Christ,

727
00:40:50,015 --> 00:40:53,451
I receive it,
and I rejoice in it.

728
00:40:53,452 --> 00:40:54,819
Amen.

729
00:40:54,820 --> 00:40:56,586
And amen.

730
00:40:59,591 --> 00:41:01,090
Thanks.

731
00:41:04,529 --> 00:41:06,864
STEVE: Okay, well, thank
you for another great meal,

732
00:41:06,865 --> 00:41:07,832
Mrs. Nichols.

733
00:41:07,833 --> 00:41:08,799
You're welcome.

734
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:11,869
And I'll see you for a
tutoring session at the

735
00:41:11,870 --> 00:41:12,969
library on Thursday.

736
00:41:13,638 --> 00:41:15,072
Sir?

737
00:41:15,073 --> 00:41:17,741
Yeah. Hey, thanks for
doing the dishes again, Steve.

738
00:41:17,742 --> 00:41:18,776
I appreciate it.

739
00:41:18,777 --> 00:41:19,844
Pleasure.

740
00:41:19,845 --> 00:41:21,045
You know, while
you're still here,

741
00:41:21,046 --> 00:41:22,713
I could use some
help out in the garage.

742
00:41:22,714 --> 00:41:24,482
No, he can't.

743
00:41:24,483 --> 00:41:26,116
JIM: I could use a pair
of second, strong hands.

744
00:41:26,117 --> 00:41:28,853
Being in the military like I am,
we tend to move around a lot,

745
00:41:28,854 --> 00:41:30,554
and basically I just throw
everything in my truck and dump

746
00:41:30,555 --> 00:41:31,789
it in the garage.

747
00:41:31,790 --> 00:41:33,557
I could use some
help sorting it out.

748
00:41:33,558 --> 00:41:35,693
MARION: Jim.
He's not your employee.

749
00:41:35,694 --> 00:41:38,963
I'm sure Steve has his
own life to get back to.

750
00:41:38,964 --> 00:41:42,032
I'm sure he does, but two
of us working together,

751
00:41:42,033 --> 00:41:44,168
get it done in
less than an hour.

752
00:41:44,169 --> 00:41:46,503
Besides, I don't think
Steve minds, do you Steve?

753
00:41:47,672 --> 00:41:50,206
Okay. Sure.
Yeah, of course, no problem.

754
00:41:50,976 --> 00:41:51,775
Yeah.

755
00:41:51,776 --> 00:41:52,809
I'll meet you out there.

756
00:41:53,512 --> 00:41:54,512
Sure.

757
00:41:59,050 --> 00:42:00,884
Don't you have
some homework to do?

758
00:42:17,002 --> 00:42:18,936
JIM: My wife's the
sentimental type.

759
00:42:18,937 --> 00:42:20,804
She likes to keep things.

760
00:42:20,805 --> 00:42:23,007
This is all the stuff she's
kept over all our moves.

761
00:42:23,008 --> 00:42:25,109
Looks like we've been
here for 30 years.

762
00:42:25,110 --> 00:42:26,777
Fact is, it's only
been a couple.

763
00:42:26,778 --> 00:42:29,547
Yeah, I'd like to see
the garage floor again.

764
00:42:29,548 --> 00:42:32,683
Far as I'm concerned,
you can junk all of this.

765
00:42:32,684 --> 00:42:36,020
I'll get you some trash bags,
you can put it all together,

766
00:42:36,021 --> 00:42:38,789
take it out front, and I'll haul
it off to the dump in my truck.

767
00:42:38,790 --> 00:42:41,091
This is a lot of stuff.

768
00:42:41,092 --> 00:42:42,859
Well you're a strong boy.

769
00:42:43,628 --> 00:42:45,161
You got some place
you need to be?

770
00:42:47,566 --> 00:42:50,233
Uhm-I have an
early morning class.

771
00:42:51,770 --> 00:42:52,836
Oh.

772
00:42:52,837 --> 00:42:54,737
Well, then you better get to it.

773
00:42:55,140 --> 00:42:56,839
Mr. Smartypants.

774
00:43:22,167 --> 00:43:24,300
You have roll call at 06:00.

775
00:43:25,937 --> 00:43:27,237
I know that.

776
00:43:27,238 --> 00:43:29,740
Just leave.
You don't owe him anything.

777
00:43:29,741 --> 00:43:31,208
He's testing me.

778
00:43:31,209 --> 00:43:33,776
He's crazy, you don't
have to put up with this.

779
00:43:34,245 --> 00:43:35,946
You're worth it.

780
00:43:35,947 --> 00:43:38,181
Please, go home.

781
00:43:38,984 --> 00:43:40,283
I'm not done yet.

782
00:43:40,819 --> 00:43:41,986
JIM: Hey!

783
00:43:41,987 --> 00:43:43,821
You're not properly
dressed, young lady!

784
00:43:43,822 --> 00:43:46,790
And you, you better
pick up the pace.

785
00:43:46,791 --> 00:43:48,691
Sun's gonna be up soon!

786
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:56,967
You wanna help him?

787
00:43:56,968 --> 00:43:58,936
You put on some proper clothes.

788
00:43:58,937 --> 00:44:02,939
[music playing]

789
00:44:11,282 --> 00:44:13,817
I know he's just
trying to break me.

790
00:44:13,818 --> 00:44:17,855
Ephesians tells us, "Husbands
should love their wives as

791
00:44:17,856 --> 00:44:20,724
Christ loved the Church and
gave himself up for her."

792
00:44:20,725 --> 00:44:22,359
So what, I
should just take it?

793
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:23,427
Whatever he throws at me?

794
00:44:23,428 --> 00:44:25,095
Yes.

795
00:44:25,096 --> 00:44:28,164
It'll be painful, you'll
wanna scream at him.

796
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:30,867
To stand up for yourself.

797
00:44:31,369 --> 00:44:33,871
But if you take it,
eventually you will overcome.

798
00:44:33,872 --> 00:44:35,672
He's just trying to
test you to make sure your

799
00:44:38,443 --> 00:44:39,559
intentions are pure.

800
00:44:39,560 --> 00:44:41,760
What do you think would happen
if you lashed out at him?

801
00:44:43,715 --> 00:44:45,448
I'd be proving him right?

802
00:44:46,217 --> 00:44:48,017
Exactly.

803
00:44:48,453 --> 00:44:51,088
STEVE: Okay, it's a six.
But this is a Y, it's an N,

804
00:44:51,089 --> 00:44:55,191
close bracket, plus open bracket
Y, plus three, equals what?

805
00:44:55,727 --> 00:44:56,894
Four.

806
00:44:56,895 --> 00:44:58,762
STEVE: No, you
actually wrote three.

807
00:44:58,763 --> 00:44:59,862
Negative four.

808
00:45:00,699 --> 00:45:03,266
It's a great try,
but it's wrong.

809
00:45:04,402 --> 00:45:05,703
I don't think it's wrong.

810
00:45:05,704 --> 00:45:07,270
It's wrong.
I don't think so.

811
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:11,007
So here,
ten questions right.

812
00:45:11,810 --> 00:45:12,810
[laughs]

813
00:45:12,811 --> 00:45:13,876
You got them.

814
00:45:14,245 --> 00:45:15,411
Steve.

815
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:17,114
Great, you're here.

816
00:45:17,115 --> 00:45:18,981
Nice to see you, sir.

817
00:45:19,317 --> 00:45:21,251
I got a serious weed
problem out in the garden,

818
00:45:21,252 --> 00:45:22,418
wanna give me a hand?

819
00:45:23,121 --> 00:45:24,888
STEVE: Weeds?

820
00:45:24,889 --> 00:45:27,056
JIM: Out of control,
like they do.

821
00:45:30,261 --> 00:45:31,394
Sure.

822
00:45:58,156 --> 00:45:59,389
Can I get some water?

823
00:45:59,390 --> 00:46:01,357
You're almost done,
just push on through.

824
00:46:06,898 --> 00:46:07,898
Argh!

825
00:46:08,933 --> 00:46:10,868
I think these gloves
have holes in them.

826
00:46:10,869 --> 00:46:12,836
It's the only ones we have.

827
00:46:12,837 --> 00:46:15,539
I- I-actually,
there are some in the garage.

828
00:46:15,540 --> 00:46:17,173
No, I got rid of those.

829
00:46:24,315 --> 00:46:25,381
Aargh!!

830
00:46:25,984 --> 00:46:26,984
All right.

831
00:46:28,887 --> 00:46:31,354
That's gonna hurt a whole
lot worse without them.

832
00:46:32,157 --> 00:46:34,057
What do I have to do?

833
00:46:34,058 --> 00:46:35,459
I don't know, what can you do?

834
00:46:35,460 --> 00:46:36,993
What is your
problem with me?

835
00:46:37,829 --> 00:46:39,929
I don't know, I just
don't trust you.

836
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:43,267
Something not right about you.

837
00:46:43,268 --> 00:46:44,935
I don't even
know what I've done.

838
00:46:44,936 --> 00:46:46,970
You don't think I see the way
you two look at each other?

839
00:46:46,971 --> 00:46:48,405
And would
that be so bad?

840
00:46:48,406 --> 00:46:50,107
Must be, or you two
wouldn't keep telling me

841
00:46:50,108 --> 00:46:52,074
that you're just friends.

842
00:46:54,279 --> 00:46:55,845
I'm not one
of your recruits.

843
00:46:57,415 --> 00:46:59,583
I knew what you were
the moment I saw you.

844
00:46:59,584 --> 00:47:00,584
And what's that?

845
00:47:00,585 --> 00:47:01,851
Soft.

846
00:47:02,854 --> 00:47:03,953
MARION: What's going on?

847
00:47:05,590 --> 00:47:07,256
Oh, nothing.

848
00:47:07,892 --> 00:47:09,926
Me and Steve were just
joking around, huh?

849
00:47:16,234 --> 00:47:17,500
You okay?

850
00:47:37,355 --> 00:47:39,223
I can't believe him.

851
00:47:39,224 --> 00:47:41,525
I shouldn't of lost
it at him like that.

852
00:47:41,526 --> 00:47:44,528
Pastor Roberts was right, I
gave him exactly what he wanted.

853
00:47:44,529 --> 00:47:45,995
This isn't your fault.

854
00:47:47,098 --> 00:47:48,865
He knows something's up.

855
00:47:49,234 --> 00:47:52,603
We'll tell him eventually,
when he comes around to it.

856
00:47:52,604 --> 00:47:56,039
I'm in the Air Police,
he's a Chief Master Sargent.

857
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:57,574
We work on the same base,

858
00:47:57,575 --> 00:47:59,376
we're just lucky
he hasn't seen me yet.

859
00:47:59,377 --> 00:48:01,378
But he's never here,
he's always off on temp duty

860
00:48:01,379 --> 00:48:04,014
at some other base.
He's got another trip coming up.

861
00:48:04,015 --> 00:48:05,581
We're fine.

862
00:48:10,154 --> 00:48:11,454
I don't know.

863
00:48:17,929 --> 00:48:20,063
Just cover for me on guard duty.

864
00:48:20,064 --> 00:48:21,431
ROBBIE: I covered
for you last time,

865
00:48:21,432 --> 00:48:23,100
the watch commander caught me.

866
00:48:23,101 --> 00:48:25,968
I spent hours,
hours cleaning toilets.

867
00:48:26,671 --> 00:48:28,631
You know I can't pee in a
public bathroom anymore?

868
00:48:29,340 --> 00:48:32,109
You know how long it
takes to scrub a toilet

869
00:48:32,110 --> 00:48:33,210
with a toothbrush?

870
00:48:33,211 --> 00:48:35,646
You know how long it
takes to scrub fifteen?

871
00:48:35,647 --> 00:48:37,381
Fifteen of them.

872
00:48:37,382 --> 00:48:39,622
Yeah, because I did it when
I covered for you with Julie.

873
00:48:40,285 --> 00:48:41,952
You mean my wife?

874
00:48:41,953 --> 00:48:43,519
You haven't proposed yet.

875
00:48:44,222 --> 00:48:47,023
Not yet, but I might do, maybe.

876
00:48:47,659 --> 00:48:48,959
Maybe not.

877
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:50,426
She keeps me on my toes.

878
00:48:51,129 --> 00:48:52,262
And she's cute.

879
00:48:52,263 --> 00:48:53,329
Are you done yet?

880
00:48:54,065 --> 00:48:55,231
Maybe.

881
00:48:56,267 --> 00:48:57,667
Maybe not.

882
00:48:59,203 --> 00:49:00,570
You owe me.

883
00:49:00,571 --> 00:49:01,939
I don't owe you.

884
00:49:01,940 --> 00:49:03,572
I paid you back, we're square.

885
00:49:05,176 --> 00:49:06,976
Look, they haven't
seen this guy in weeks.

886
00:49:07,278 --> 00:49:08,711
Or the-

887
00:49:13,618 --> 00:49:14,717
JIM: At ease.

888
00:49:17,288 --> 00:49:18,487
Whoops.

889
00:49:22,260 --> 00:49:23,592
Your friend here-

890
00:49:24,729 --> 00:49:26,128
liar.

891
00:49:36,307 --> 00:49:37,506
Are you okay?

892
00:49:39,644 --> 00:49:41,644
I won't be soon.

893
00:49:47,986 --> 00:49:49,452
JIM: Marion?

894
00:49:49,654 --> 00:49:51,387
Jan?
Jan?

895
00:49:53,224 --> 00:49:55,292
You know that young man
who comes into our house,

896
00:49:55,293 --> 00:49:57,094
eats our food, your friend.

897
00:49:57,095 --> 00:49:58,762
The one you insulted?

898
00:49:58,763 --> 00:50:01,031
Didn't think I knew
about that, did you?

899
00:50:01,032 --> 00:50:04,101
I should've done worse
considering the-student

900
00:50:04,102 --> 00:50:06,602
just waved me through
the gate on base.

901
00:50:07,705 --> 00:50:08,739
Well?

902
00:50:08,740 --> 00:50:10,640
I wasn't lying.

903
00:50:10,641 --> 00:50:14,344
He is a student, he's just
also in the Air Force.

904
00:50:14,345 --> 00:50:16,580
You don't think that was
important for me to know?

905
00:50:16,581 --> 00:50:18,548
I knew that you wouldn't
like it, and I like him,

906
00:50:18,549 --> 00:50:20,050
so I didn't tell you.

907
00:50:20,051 --> 00:50:21,584
You're dating a GI?

908
00:50:22,487 --> 00:50:24,020
I guess I am.

909
00:50:26,457 --> 00:50:27,758
Not anymore you're not.

910
00:50:27,759 --> 00:50:30,093
You can't stop me
from seeing him.

911
00:50:30,094 --> 00:50:31,595
What? You don't
think I can find a way to get

912
00:50:31,596 --> 00:50:33,330
him dishonorably discharged?

913
00:50:33,331 --> 00:50:35,432
I got a half a dozen officers
on that base who would find a

914
00:50:35,433 --> 00:50:36,733
reason for me in a heartbeat.

915
00:50:36,734 --> 00:50:38,068
You wouldn't do that.

916
00:50:38,069 --> 00:50:38,668
Of course I would.

917
00:50:38,669 --> 00:50:40,237
No, he's a good man.

918
00:50:40,238 --> 00:50:42,072
He's a liar.

919
00:50:42,073 --> 00:50:47,277
He came in to my house and lied
to my face night after night.

920
00:50:47,278 --> 00:50:48,711
I asked him to.

921
00:50:49,714 --> 00:50:52,549
Sweetheart, he's not
good enough for you.

922
00:50:52,550 --> 00:50:54,583
Well shouldn't I
get to decide that?

923
00:50:55,586 --> 00:50:57,653
This is for the best.

924
00:50:58,656 --> 00:50:59,556
No.

925
00:50:59,557 --> 00:51:01,123
No!

926
00:51:01,659 --> 00:51:02,826
That's it.

927
00:51:02,827 --> 00:51:04,561
It's done.

928
00:51:04,562 --> 00:51:07,430
[music playing]

929
00:51:12,203 --> 00:51:13,803
I'll talk to him.

930
00:51:23,448 --> 00:51:25,081
Sweetheart.

931
00:51:26,250 --> 00:51:28,617
Steve, blink if you can hear me.

932
00:51:33,658 --> 00:51:35,724
Give us a little blink, dad.

933
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:37,526
Please.

934
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:48,437
[music playing]

935
00:52:00,384 --> 00:52:01,784
Are we being punished?

936
00:52:04,422 --> 00:52:05,488
No.

937
00:52:08,292 --> 00:52:09,525
Hey mom,

938
00:52:11,762 --> 00:52:13,562
I know you
don't wanna move dad.

939
00:52:14,599 --> 00:52:15,698
Okay?

940
00:52:17,435 --> 00:52:21,670
But I do think we probably have
some decisions to make though.

941
00:52:22,707 --> 00:52:24,607
What should we do?

942
00:52:25,510 --> 00:52:30,147
I talked to the staff here
and they have an end-of-life

943
00:52:30,148 --> 00:52:36,519
physician, and maybe just
tomorrow we go talk to him,

944
00:52:37,688 --> 00:52:39,855
figure out what our options are.

945
00:52:41,392 --> 00:52:44,326
TERRI: Can we just
hold on a little longer?

946
00:52:45,196 --> 00:52:46,695
It's just to get information.

947
00:52:47,331 --> 00:52:49,498
Okay?
That's all it is.

948
00:52:50,268 --> 00:52:51,734
I understand.

949
00:52:55,439 --> 00:52:57,641
DR. RUSSO: Your daughter
has brought me up to speed

950
00:52:57,642 --> 00:53:00,293
on your situation,

951
00:53:00,294 --> 00:53:02,946
and obviously there's no problem
leaving Steve right where he is.

952
00:53:02,947 --> 00:53:05,581
Our trauma center staff can
handle everything you need.

953
00:53:05,917 --> 00:53:07,383
Thank you.

954
00:53:08,586 --> 00:53:10,387
I have a question.

955
00:53:10,388 --> 00:53:12,522
Absolutely, that's
what I'm here for.

956
00:53:12,523 --> 00:53:16,959
Everyone keeps telling
me that there's no hope.

957
00:53:17,695 --> 00:53:18,762
Why?

958
00:53:18,763 --> 00:53:23,299
I am useless to you if I
don't tell you the truth.

959
00:53:23,901 --> 00:53:27,437
The reason that everyone is
telling you there's no hope

960
00:53:27,438 --> 00:53:29,705
is because there is none.

961
00:53:30,942 --> 00:53:32,976
Steve's lungs started to
collapse before he arrived at

962
00:53:32,977 --> 00:53:34,543
the hospital.

963
00:53:35,379 --> 00:53:38,747
Along with that and the
paralysis as one thing,

964
00:53:39,684 --> 00:53:42,352
there's just too many
things to deal with.

965
00:53:42,353 --> 00:53:45,722
But people just don't die
because they're paralyzed.

966
00:53:45,723 --> 00:53:47,591
It's more than that.

967
00:53:47,592 --> 00:53:49,326
DR. RUSSO: You're right.

968
00:53:49,327 --> 00:53:52,662
In Steve's case, if he recovered
the ability to breathe on his

969
00:53:52,663 --> 00:53:57,234
own, or if his heart could beat
without the extreme medical

970
00:53:57,235 --> 00:54:02,272
interventions he's currently on,
then yes he would have some sort

971
00:54:02,273 --> 00:54:06,476
of opportunity for a functional
life outside of the hospital

972
00:54:06,477 --> 00:54:08,245
as a quadriplegic.

973
00:54:08,246 --> 00:54:09,613
Okay.

974
00:54:09,614 --> 00:54:12,249
Some people in these
situations have recovered.

975
00:54:12,250 --> 00:54:14,017
We researched it.

976
00:54:14,018 --> 00:54:16,419
I understand.

977
00:54:16,420 --> 00:54:18,822
But, if that were going to
happen we would've seen some

978
00:54:18,823 --> 00:54:21,023
sign of it by now.

979
00:54:22,526 --> 00:54:24,394
Your accident was
Friday morning?

980
00:54:24,395 --> 00:54:25,996
Mm-hmm.

981
00:54:25,997 --> 00:54:28,665
DR. RUSSO: By Sunday evening
Steve's heart still showed no

982
00:54:28,666 --> 00:54:31,600
ability to
tolerate reduced drugs.

983
00:54:32,570 --> 00:54:37,406
His lungs clearly still showed
no ability to work on their own.

984
00:54:38,776 --> 00:54:43,980
And since then, every test
consistently shows that he's not

985
00:54:43,981 --> 00:54:47,316
only not improving,
he's getting worse.

986
00:54:49,320 --> 00:54:53,622
Today is Tuesday, soon he won't
be responsive in any way.

987
00:54:55,926 --> 00:54:59,929
I'm sure we can prolong
his life artificially but

988
00:54:59,930 --> 00:55:01,930
would he want that?

989
00:55:03,501 --> 00:55:05,734
I can't answer that for you.

990
00:55:06,771 --> 00:55:10,306
You have to decide that
together as a family.

991
00:55:12,410 --> 00:55:14,711
I have prayed and prayed.

992
00:55:14,712 --> 00:55:17,012
How does God decide
when to make a miracle?

993
00:55:19,317 --> 00:55:20,883
And why your dad?

994
00:55:21,786 --> 00:55:23,320
We've had faith.

995
00:55:23,321 --> 00:55:26,088
Mom, it's in His hands.

996
00:55:27,558 --> 00:55:31,527
We don't know when
God does what he does.

997
00:55:32,897 --> 00:55:34,963
But we have to keep our faith.

998
00:55:36,434 --> 00:55:38,801
I don't think that's
possible for me right now.

999
00:55:39,403 --> 00:55:43,772
Bad things happen to
good people all the time.

1000
00:55:46,510 --> 00:55:48,677
Mom, we have got
to keep believing.

1001
00:55:49,880 --> 00:55:51,980
Do you think he knows?

1002
00:55:54,051 --> 00:55:55,585
What?

1003
00:55:55,586 --> 00:55:57,086
That's he's dying?

1004
00:56:00,758 --> 00:56:03,827
JAN: He was always the careful
one, he was always careful.

1005
00:56:03,828 --> 00:56:05,895
I am the one who
should not be here.

1006
00:56:05,896 --> 00:56:07,364
MICHELE: Hey.

1007
00:56:07,365 --> 00:56:10,132
Mom hey, you cannot feel
guilty for surviving.

1008
00:56:11,402 --> 00:56:13,702
If I could trade places
with him I would.

STEVE: Your dad's
gonna go nuclear.

1012
00:57:06,590 --> 00:57:09,559
That won't change
if we go back now.

1013
00:57:09,560 --> 00:57:10,960
Something's happened.

1014
00:57:10,961 --> 00:57:12,161
What?

1015
00:57:13,063 --> 00:57:14,630
They're transferring me.

1016
00:57:15,766 --> 00:57:16,999
To where?

1017
00:57:17,701 --> 00:57:19,669
Omaha, Nebraska.

1018
00:57:19,670 --> 00:57:21,004
Nebraska?

1019
00:57:21,005 --> 00:57:22,705
Why?

1020
00:57:22,706 --> 00:57:26,041
I'll be part of the Elite
Guard at Strategic Air Command.

1021
00:57:28,045 --> 00:57:29,645
I'll be guarding generals.

1022
00:57:31,949 --> 00:57:33,483
I'm proud of you.

I might be gone
for a long time.

That's why I wanted
to talk to you.

1027

Are you really gonna
do this right now?

1028

How did you know?

1029
00:57:52,837 --> 00:57:54,771
I'm not stupid, Steve.

1030

No.

don't you think we should?

Yes that's exactly why.

1035

with me because I love you?

Don't people usually get a ring
in these kind of situation?

You know-I-

I make like $250 a month, I
can't afford what you deserve.

1045
00:58:42,620 --> 00:58:45,889
That's okay, you'd probably
pick the wrong one anyway,

1046
00:58:45,890 --> 00:58:47,856
I can pick my own.

What?

1052

My dad always said that
if he caught me dating a GI

1053
00:59:09,880 --> 00:59:12,015
he'd ship me off to Nebraska.

father's blessing.

I know what he's been like,
but he's still my dad.

1057

What if he
doesn't give it to me?

1058
00:59:28,198 --> 00:59:30,767
I don't see how we can
be married if he doesn't.

1059
00:59:30,768 --> 00:59:32,301
He'll always be my father.

1060
00:59:33,070 --> 00:59:34,804
I don't want us to
spend the rest of our

1061

lives sneaking around.

1062
00:59:36,040 --> 00:59:38,840
So you won't
marry me if he doesn't?

1063
00:59:40,744 --> 00:59:42,645
It's important to me.

1064

Okay.

have to do to get it.

have to talk to him some time.

01:00:39,303 --> 01:00:41,637
[Jeep drives off]

1080
01:00:45,909 --> 01:00:47,042
Chief?

1081
01:00:56,754 --> 01:00:59,188
Liar who takes my
daughter to make out in

1082
01:00:59,189 --> 01:01:00,656
the middle of the night.

1083
01:01:01,225 --> 01:01:02,358
[clears throat]

1084
01:01:02,359 --> 01:01:05,127
There is something
I want to ask you.

1085
01:01:05,996 --> 01:01:09,931
Well I'm going to do a
little target practice later on,

1086
01:01:11,035 --> 01:01:13,101
we can talk then.

1087
01:01:13,671 --> 01:01:14,903
Okay.

1088
01:01:31,889 --> 01:01:33,690
JIM: So tell me something
Steve, you a shooter?

1089
01:01:33,691 --> 01:01:34,691
STEVE: Yes sir.

1090
01:01:34,692 --> 01:01:35,692
You any good?

1091
01:01:35,693 --> 01:01:36,993
I'm okay.

1092
01:01:36,994 --> 01:01:39,328
Have some pride son,
come on let's go.

1093
01:01:39,329 --> 01:01:40,362
This way.

1094
01:01:47,838 --> 01:01:49,371
Shouldn't
you lead the way?

1095
01:01:50,174 --> 01:01:53,109
You're doing just fine,
it's about 100 yards up here.

1096
01:01:53,110 --> 01:01:54,376
We'll be good.

1097
01:02:04,388 --> 01:02:05,487
Keep going?

1098
01:02:06,356 --> 01:02:08,190
50 yards.

1099
01:02:09,326 --> 01:02:10,726
[gun shot]

1100
01:02:11,195 --> 01:02:12,462
Good shot, chief.

1101
01:02:12,463 --> 01:02:14,463
Nobody likes a
suck-up Steve, your turn.

1102
01:02:21,205 --> 01:02:22,205
[gun shot]

1103
01:02:23,307 --> 01:02:25,007
You sure you qualified
on the range?

1104
01:02:25,008 --> 01:02:26,375
I did.

1105
01:02:26,376 --> 01:02:27,943
You say so.

1106
01:02:29,847 --> 01:02:33,449
Set me up a bottle, I'm going to
move back here about 30 feet,

1107
01:02:33,450 --> 01:02:35,250
challenge myself.

1108
01:02:44,361 --> 01:02:45,761
[gun shot]

1109
01:02:47,498 --> 01:02:49,832
Are you insane?

1110
01:02:49,833 --> 01:02:52,168
Oh man calm down I could
shoot a pimple off your face.

1111
01:02:52,169 --> 01:02:54,002
STEVE: You're crazy.

1112
01:02:54,003 --> 01:02:55,838
Don't be so touchy
Steve, you're fine.

1113
01:02:55,839 --> 01:02:56,539
Chief Nichols.

1114
01:02:56,540 --> 01:02:58,241
What?

1115
01:02:58,242 --> 01:03:00,523
I am here to ask for your
blessing to marry your daughter.

1116
01:03:02,279 --> 01:03:03,913
Oh.
Is that right?

1117
01:03:03,914 --> 01:03:04,947
Yes sir.

1118
01:03:04,948 --> 01:03:08,417
Well I'll tell you what.
You see that brown bottle

1119
01:03:08,418 --> 01:03:10,920
back there,
that's about 15 metres away.

1120
01:03:10,921 --> 01:03:13,422
That's far less than you
need to qualify on the range.

1121
01:03:13,423 --> 01:03:16,559
I'm going to give you two shots.
You hit one of them,

1122
01:03:16,560 --> 01:03:19,795
you'll have my blessing
to marry my daughter.

1123
01:03:21,198 --> 01:03:22,330
You're on.

1124
01:03:23,333 --> 01:03:24,967
Why do you want
to marry her now anyway?

1125
01:03:24,968 --> 01:03:26,035
What's the hurry?

1126
01:03:26,036 --> 01:03:27,804
I'm being transferred.

1127
01:03:27,805 --> 01:03:28,938
Is that right?

1128
01:03:28,939 --> 01:03:29,906
Out of state?

1129
01:03:29,907 --> 01:03:31,474
Yes, can
you stop talking.

1130
01:03:31,475 --> 01:03:32,475
Where to?

1131
01:03:33,110 --> 01:03:35,310
Omaha.
Can I shoot now?

1132
01:03:35,512 --> 01:03:37,279
Yeah, sure.
Go ahead.

1133
01:03:39,416 --> 01:03:40,850
[gun shot]

1134
01:03:40,851 --> 01:03:44,253
Steve, it's a lot easier to fall
in love with a girl that you can

1135
01:03:44,254 --> 01:03:48,257
see, but you're going to be on
a new base and your air force

1136
01:03:48,258 --> 01:03:51,027
buddies, they're going to be
telling you that she's already

1137
01:03:51,028 --> 01:03:52,962
forgotten about you and you're
going to be sitting there

1138
01:03:52,963 --> 01:03:54,530
waiting for your
Dear John letter.

1139
01:03:54,531 --> 01:03:56,399
It won't be
like that for us.

1140
01:03:56,400 --> 01:03:59,368
You're going to be out on leave,
out in the world socializing.

1141
01:03:59,369 --> 01:04:01,436
There's going to be all
sorts of other women.

1142
01:04:01,437 --> 01:04:03,506
Women that you can see and you
can smell that are a lot more

1143
01:04:03,507 --> 01:04:05,474
real than anything you can write
down on a piece of paper or

1144
01:04:05,475 --> 01:04:07,243
what's in a photograph.

1145
01:04:07,244 --> 01:04:08,244
That's not true.

1146
01:04:08,912 --> 01:04:10,879
You're still human, Steve.

1147
01:04:11,915 --> 01:04:15,383
Everything you're about to do
is to push you away from her.

1148
01:04:16,353 --> 01:04:18,621
The only thing pushing
me away from your daughter

1149
01:04:18,622 --> 01:04:21,022
is you, Mr. Nichols.

1150
01:04:22,359 --> 01:04:25,260
But guess what, I qualified
as an expert marksman too.

1151
01:04:26,396 --> 01:04:27,430
Go on.

1152
01:04:27,431 --> 01:04:29,364
[exhales]

1153
01:04:43,080 --> 01:04:44,412
[gun shot]

1154
01:04:47,451 --> 01:04:49,384
Yeah well that was close.

1155
01:04:50,254 --> 01:04:52,654
Go ahead and do me a favour
son, let her down easy.

1156
01:04:55,225 --> 01:05:00,962
[music playing]

1157
01:05:08,572 --> 01:05:10,472
If you're ready to leave-

1158
01:05:12,509 --> 01:05:14,910
I need you to say goodbye.

1159
01:05:17,247 --> 01:05:20,148
They think I
should let you go,

1160
01:05:22,352 --> 01:05:24,319
but it still feels wrong.

1161
01:05:26,290 --> 01:05:28,990
I need you to tell
me what to do.

1162
01:05:33,130 --> 01:05:36,498
Please, please
tell me what to do.

1163
01:05:38,035 --> 01:05:39,401
Please.

1164
01:05:56,119 --> 01:05:57,185
Okay.

1165
01:06:01,124 --> 01:06:02,223
Okay.

1166
01:06:05,095 --> 01:06:06,294
I love you.

1167
01:06:17,140 --> 01:06:18,707
Your dad told me what he wants.

1168
01:06:24,614 --> 01:06:26,114
How?

1169
01:06:28,418 --> 01:06:30,552
We've been together 46 years.

1170
01:06:32,456 --> 01:06:37,025
I asked and God let
him tell me in his way.

1171
01:06:39,596 --> 01:06:41,463
What did he say?

1172
01:06:42,699 --> 01:06:44,199
He's ready to go.

1173
01:06:50,140 --> 01:06:53,742
If God's up there he's ready
to welcome Dad in to Heaven.

1174
01:06:57,414 --> 01:06:59,247
Look at you.

1175
01:07:02,085 --> 01:07:03,485
I said if.

1176
01:07:04,721 --> 01:07:06,221
He is-

1177
01:07:08,792 --> 01:07:10,759
and he will.

1178
01:07:12,362 --> 01:07:14,629
You think Pastor Roberts
is still in town?

1179
01:07:17,300 --> 01:07:19,467
Another half hour and
I'd have been on my flight.

1180
01:07:21,772 --> 01:07:23,538
I didn't think I
would see you again.

1181
01:07:24,441 --> 01:07:26,508
You're no more
surprised than me.

1182
01:07:34,284 --> 01:07:36,151
[sniffles]

1183
01:07:39,489 --> 01:07:40,922
How does it happen?

1184
01:07:40,923 --> 01:07:42,358
Without medication his heart
rate will drop to critical

1185
01:07:42,359 --> 01:07:45,594
levels, and he won't
be able to breathe.

1186
01:07:45,595 --> 01:07:47,196
Will he be in pain?

1187
01:07:47,197 --> 01:07:49,331
No, he'll be sedated.

1188
01:07:49,332 --> 01:07:51,300
He'll be comfortable.

1189
01:07:51,301 --> 01:07:55,603
And then he'll pass peacefully
when we turn off support.

1190
01:07:57,441 --> 01:08:00,275
Is there a time you prefer?

1191
01:08:04,381 --> 01:08:07,615
You-you want me to choose
what time my husband dies?

1192
01:08:09,820 --> 01:08:11,152
Yes.

1193
01:08:12,522 --> 01:08:15,191
I'd suggest 11 a.m.

1194
01:08:15,192 --> 01:08:18,760
It's between visiting
hours and it'll be quiet.

1195
01:08:19,329 --> 01:08:20,729
Can they stay with him?

1196
01:08:20,730 --> 01:08:22,798
Absolutely.

1197
01:08:22,799 --> 01:08:24,866
You can stay as
long as you need.

1198
01:08:27,404 --> 01:08:29,872
Heavenly Father,
we come to you at a time

1199
01:08:29,873 --> 01:08:33,241
of sadness,
asking you for peace.

1200
01:08:34,611 --> 01:08:40,416
Almighty God, we are here today
because Steve is ready to depart

1201
01:08:40,417 --> 01:08:45,221
this world and we ask you, oh
Lord that you allow him to pass

1202
01:08:45,222 --> 01:08:47,422
as he desired to live.

1203
01:08:48,558 --> 01:08:52,827
In your church, in your
faith, and in your love.

1204
01:08:54,297 --> 01:08:56,832
We ask you oh Lord that
you take him into eternity

1205
01:08:56,833 --> 01:08:58,666
to go home with you.

1206
01:09:02,172 --> 01:09:03,371
Can I say something?

1207
01:09:05,475 --> 01:09:06,875
Of course.

1208
01:09:10,714 --> 01:09:15,350
MICHELE: God, my dad
devoted his entire life to you.

1209
01:09:16,920 --> 01:09:20,355
So I just ask that you
please take care of him

1210
01:09:22,225 --> 01:09:23,925
on the other side.

1211
01:09:25,896 --> 01:09:28,663
Will you please tell him
that he will always be-

1212
01:09:29,566 --> 01:09:31,499
so loved-

1213
01:09:34,171 --> 01:09:35,503
and remembered.

1214
01:09:41,211 --> 01:09:44,547
[sobbing]

1215
01:09:44,548 --> 01:09:46,214
And that we love him.

1216
01:09:47,584 --> 01:09:50,219
And that he's in Jesus' hands.

1217
01:09:50,220 --> 01:09:51,787
Lord we-

1218
01:09:51,788 --> 01:09:54,422
we let him go in
to your hands now.

1219
01:09:55,892 --> 01:09:57,892
[sobbing]

1220
01:09:59,262 --> 01:10:01,196
In Jesus' name,

1221
01:10:04,434 --> 01:10:05,434
amen.

1222
01:10:05,969 --> 01:10:07,603
PASTOR ROBERTS: And amen.

1223
01:10:07,604 --> 01:10:09,054
[music playing]

1224
01:10:09,055 --> 01:10:10,506
STEVE: No that's it then.

1225
01:10:10,507 --> 01:10:12,575
We're never getting married.

1226
01:10:12,576 --> 01:10:15,511
You can try again, he'll
warm up to you eventually.

1227
01:10:15,512 --> 01:10:17,780
No he won't,
okay you weren't there.

1228
01:10:17,781 --> 01:10:19,515
You didn't see his face.

1229
01:10:19,516 --> 01:10:21,683
And we don't have
time for eventually.

1230
01:10:22,752 --> 01:10:25,521
We-we just,
we can't give up.

1231
01:10:25,522 --> 01:10:28,957
He'll never accept
me, okay you're right.

1232
01:10:29,693 --> 01:10:31,627
It's not going to be any kind
of life if we're sneaking

1233
01:10:31,628 --> 01:10:34,930
around forever, Okay?
That's your family.

1234
01:10:34,931 --> 01:10:36,765
I'm not going to come
between him and you.

1235
01:10:36,766 --> 01:10:38,000
Well you shouldn't have to.

1236
01:10:38,001 --> 01:10:39,567
You're not listening to me.

1237
01:10:40,003 --> 01:10:41,402
Hey!

1238
01:10:42,405 --> 01:10:43,972
I'm saying I won't.

1239
01:10:46,376 --> 01:10:47,942
You're saying that this is over?

1240
01:10:49,012 --> 01:10:50,478
It has to be.

1241
01:10:54,517 --> 01:10:56,384
[knocks on door]

1242
01:11:01,258 --> 01:11:03,491
Now we couldn't have discussed
this in the morning?

1243
01:11:04,527 --> 01:11:06,528
I'm sorry, I just
didn't know where to go,

1244
01:11:06,529 --> 01:11:08,496
and Steve's going to
get transferred soon.

1245
01:11:09,266 --> 01:11:10,398
It's alright.

1246
01:11:13,603 --> 01:11:17,739
Love is patient and kind,
it does not envy or boast.

1247
01:11:19,609 --> 01:11:22,310
It is not arrogant or rude.

1248
01:11:23,313 --> 01:11:25,647
It does not insist
on its own way.

1249
01:11:26,816 --> 01:11:29,717
It is not irritable

1250
01:11:32,922 --> 01:11:35,824
and it never
rejoices at wrongdoing.

1251
01:11:35,825 --> 01:11:38,559
It rejoices with truth.

1252
01:11:39,663 --> 01:11:41,529
That's Corinthians.

1253
01:11:42,365 --> 01:11:43,531
[sniffles]

1254
01:11:44,834 --> 01:11:47,903
That's Steve, he's taken
everything my dad's thrown at

1255
01:11:47,904 --> 01:11:50,471
him and he's done it with
patience and kindness.

1256
01:11:53,310 --> 01:11:58,447
Imagine that Steve did leave
and never returned and you never

1257
01:11:58,448 --> 01:12:02,718
got back together, imagine
yourself two years from now.

1258
01:12:02,719 --> 01:12:03,851
What do you see?

1259
01:12:04,988 --> 01:12:06,554
Nothing.

1260
01:12:07,924 --> 01:12:10,425
How does that make you
feel to think about it?

1261
01:12:12,796 --> 01:12:15,763
Like trying to imagine
walking on the moon.

1262
01:12:19,669 --> 01:12:20,802
Alright.

1263
01:12:21,604 --> 01:12:22,970
Well?

1264
01:12:24,741 --> 01:12:26,709
You know what you have to do.

1265
01:12:26,710 --> 01:12:29,078
Now let me get some sleep,
I still have to conduct

1266
01:12:29,079 --> 01:12:30,646
morning services.

1267
01:12:30,647 --> 01:12:32,648
But I don't know what to
do, that's why I came here.

1268
01:12:32,649 --> 01:12:34,982
I... tell me what to do?

1269
01:12:35,385 --> 01:12:36,851
You need to me say it for you?

1270
01:12:37,921 --> 01:12:41,723
You obviously love him,
if you want him,

1271
01:12:42,792 --> 01:12:44,359
then go fight for him.

1272
01:13:04,414 --> 01:13:05,480
[exhales]

1273
01:13:08,017 --> 01:13:09,450
I love him.

1274
01:13:10,453 --> 01:13:12,721
You're still a teenager,
you think you love him.

1275
01:13:12,722 --> 01:13:14,689
Once he's gone,
you'll forget about him.

1276
01:13:15,058 --> 01:13:17,058
I will never forget him.

1277
01:13:19,929 --> 01:13:21,796
Jan, I've said my piece.

1278
01:13:23,166 --> 01:13:24,533
You can't do this.

1279
01:13:24,534 --> 01:13:25,800
Oh yeah? Try me!

1280
01:13:26,503 --> 01:13:27,903
You can't do this.

1281
01:13:27,904 --> 01:13:30,506
Dad, you can't...

1282
01:13:30,507 --> 01:13:32,841
This conversation
is over, young lady.

1283
01:13:32,842 --> 01:13:34,643
It will never be over.

1284
01:13:34,644 --> 01:13:37,078
He left me, he's gone.

1285
01:13:37,947 --> 01:13:40,182
Because of you, you won.

1286
01:13:40,183 --> 01:13:41,817
Does that make you happy?

1287
01:13:41,818 --> 01:13:42,985
Does that bring you joy?

1288
01:13:42,986 --> 01:13:46,554
I hope so, I hope so.

1289
01:13:47,157 --> 01:13:50,993
I hope so because you
did lose one thing.

1290
01:13:50,994 --> 01:13:52,994
Do you know what that is?

1291
01:13:54,531 --> 01:13:55,696
You lost me.

1292
01:13:57,066 --> 01:14:01,169
I will never forgive you,
I'm never going to forget this,

1293
01:14:02,105 --> 01:14:03,605
ever.

1294
01:14:03,606 --> 01:14:06,608
Well then there's no point in
talking about this anymore,

1295
01:14:06,609 --> 01:14:07,775
is there?

1296
01:14:08,578 --> 01:14:09,677
We're done.

1297
01:14:37,607 --> 01:14:39,640
You're just like him, you know.

1298
01:14:40,977 --> 01:14:42,910
That why you're so scared?

1299
01:14:45,682 --> 01:14:48,583
We were younger than they
are when we got married.

1300
01:14:49,886 --> 01:14:52,753
You think my friends didn't
try to warn me about you?

1301
01:14:53,957 --> 01:14:56,124
You think they didn't
say exactly what you're

1302
01:14:56,125 --> 01:14:57,792
saying about Steve?

1303
01:14:59,996 --> 01:15:03,732
But I didn't judge
you on what other people

1304
01:15:03,733 --> 01:15:05,500
thought you might be.

1305
01:15:06,803 --> 01:15:08,769
I judged you on your actions.

1306
01:15:09,873 --> 01:15:11,072
He lied to us.

1307
01:15:12,175 --> 01:15:14,208
Because he was afraid.

1308
01:15:15,578 --> 01:15:16,979
You do know that they've
been seeing each other

1309
01:15:16,980 --> 01:15:18,146
behind our backs?

1310
01:15:18,147 --> 01:15:20,214
You hear her creeping
out late at night.

1311
01:15:20,750 --> 01:15:23,685
Is that how you want our
future son-in-law to behave?

1312
01:15:23,686 --> 01:15:25,720
What other choice
did you give them?

1313
01:15:26,089 --> 01:15:28,856
Well he's transferring.

1314
01:15:30,026 --> 01:15:33,595
And if he wasn't serious about
our daughter it would be a

1315
01:15:33,596 --> 01:15:36,598
perfect opportunity
for him to end it.

1316
01:15:36,599 --> 01:15:37,865
It is.

1317
01:15:46,075 --> 01:15:49,243
You remember when I was nine
months pregnant with Jan

1318
01:15:50,213 --> 01:15:53,581
and we thought I would go
in to labor at any moment?

1319
01:15:57,820 --> 01:15:59,954
You would do this all night.

1320
01:16:01,190 --> 01:16:03,324
I have a meeting with
General Robinson tomorrow.

1321
01:16:10,567 --> 01:16:12,333
Your shoes are clean, honey,

1322
01:16:12,702 --> 01:16:14,702
it's your conscience
that isn't.

1323
01:16:24,847 --> 01:16:25,948
You're right.

1324
01:16:25,949 --> 01:16:27,115
I am.

1325
01:16:27,116 --> 01:16:28,683
Yes you are.

1326
01:16:29,919 --> 01:16:32,186
I need to make the
choice for them.

1327
01:16:35,625 --> 01:16:36,691
[sigh]

1328
01:16:42,365 --> 01:16:43,998
What are you going to do?

1329
01:16:44,300 --> 01:16:45,634
STEVE: What can I do?

1330
01:16:45,635 --> 01:16:47,268
I don't have a choice.

1331
01:16:49,205 --> 01:16:50,338
It's over.

1332
01:16:52,709 --> 01:16:53,774
Might want to take a walk.

1333
01:17:01,851 --> 01:17:03,084
What do you want?

1334
01:17:03,753 --> 01:17:05,786
You'll address me as Chief, son.

1335
01:17:06,656 --> 01:17:08,824
Okay, what do
you want-Chief?

1336
01:17:08,825 --> 01:17:10,926
I can have you written
up for insubordination.

1337
01:17:10,927 --> 01:17:12,060
Yes sir,
if that's all sir.

1338
01:17:12,061 --> 01:17:13,227
I have nothing to say to you.

1339
01:17:15,031 --> 01:17:17,132
I just have one
question for you.

1340
01:17:17,133 --> 01:17:18,834
What's that?

1341
01:17:18,835 --> 01:17:20,135
Why are you in the service?

1342
01:17:20,136 --> 01:17:21,969
I am here to
serve my country, sir.

1343
01:17:22,372 --> 01:17:23,838
No, no.

1344
01:17:25,074 --> 01:17:27,643
I want to know what
it means to you.

1345
01:17:27,644 --> 01:17:30,745
What does it mean to you
to be in the military?

1346
01:17:31,381 --> 01:17:32,713
[breaking voice]
Everything.

1347
01:17:34,817 --> 01:17:36,851
It hasn't just
given my life purpose-

1348
01:17:39,055 --> 01:17:40,921
it's given me a family.

1349
01:17:53,403 --> 01:17:56,371
I've never seen
anything like this happen,

1350
01:17:56,372 --> 01:17:58,739
this bottle should
have broke but it didn't.

1351
01:17:59,409 --> 01:18:04,445
It got me thinking, maybe
God is leaving this to me.

1352
01:18:05,415 --> 01:18:07,816
Now, I didn't have
to tell you about that,

1353
01:18:07,817 --> 01:18:09,818
but I would have always known.

1354
01:18:09,819 --> 01:18:11,118
And I'm a man of my word.

1355
01:18:13,756 --> 01:18:16,091
So I think you're going
to marry my daughter,

1356
01:18:16,092 --> 01:18:18,926
unless you've changed
your mind of course.

1357
01:18:21,431 --> 01:18:22,831
Are you serious?

1358
01:18:22,832 --> 01:18:24,099
Yes sir.

1359
01:18:24,100 --> 01:18:25,267
Thank you.

1360
01:18:25,268 --> 01:18:27,369
Hey, hey, hey show some dignity.

1361
01:18:27,370 --> 01:18:29,337
You're still on duty.

1362
01:18:29,338 --> 01:18:30,472
Sorry sir.

1363
01:18:30,473 --> 01:18:32,239
As you were.

1364
01:18:33,209 --> 01:18:36,945
Now it's my understanding that
you don't have a lot of time to

1365
01:18:36,946 --> 01:18:39,147
marry her before you
transfer, is that right?

1366
01:18:39,148 --> 01:18:40,414
Mm-hmm.

1367
01:18:41,217 --> 01:18:44,485
Well then, we better get to it.

1368
01:18:49,158 --> 01:18:50,792
God bless you, son.

1369

1371
01:19:20,189 --> 01:19:23,191
You, somebody
could have told me.

1373
01:19:34,270 --> 01:19:37,239

worse, for richer, for poorer.

In sickness and in health.

For better or worse,
for richer or poorer,

in sickness and health.

1385

are parted by death.

1389
01:20:10,506 --> 01:20:11,940

1390
01:20:11,941 --> 01:20:13,475

I, Jan Nichols.

1392
01:20:15,444 --> 01:20:16,978
Take you Steve Hearst.

1393
01:20:16,979 --> 01:20:18,947
Take you, Steve Hearst.

1394
01:20:18,948 --> 01:20:19,981
PASTOR ROBERTS: To be my husband.

1395
01:20:19,982 --> 01:20:21,817
JAN: To be my husband.

1396

PASTOR ROBERTS: To have and
to hold from this day forward.

1397

Woo!

1409
01:21:12,501 --> 01:21:16,204
It is my honor to introduce
Jan and Steven Hearst.

What's happening?

1415
01:21:44,533 --> 01:21:47,067
I don't know, doctor,
he's still breathing.

1416
01:21:48,437 --> 01:21:50,205
DOCTOR: This is not unusual,

1417
01:21:50,206 --> 01:21:52,139
he still has
some air in his lungs.

1418
01:21:53,175 --> 01:21:55,342
He can't really breathe
without the machine.

1419
01:21:56,112 --> 01:21:57,945
He'll stop soon.

1420
01:21:58,948 --> 01:22:00,948
He wants to stay a
little longer with you.

1421
01:22:04,453 --> 01:22:06,054
I love you.

It's okay to go.

1424
01:22:12,295 --> 01:22:13,961
He's with God now.

1425
01:22:16,265 --> 01:22:17,431
Okay.
