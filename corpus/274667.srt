1
00:01:31,304 --> 00:01:32,532
Over here!

2
00:01:40,814 --> 00:01:42,748
Hurry up, Billy!

3
00:02:18,652 --> 00:02:21,644
Don't you love New Orleans?

4
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:38,093
Come on over here
and dance with me.

5
00:03:08,768 --> 00:03:10,770
Look what she ordered.

6
00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:12,806
Come here, honey.

7
00:03:12,806 --> 00:03:16,776
Darling, 11 months is
a little young for jambalaya.

8
00:03:16,776 --> 00:03:19,412
The doctor said we should
start her on solids.

9
00:03:19,412 --> 00:03:20,814
Jambalaya's not solids.

10
00:03:20,814 --> 00:03:23,216
He meant mushed-up
carrots and beets.

11
00:03:23,216 --> 00:03:24,484
That's for average kids.

12
00:03:24,484 --> 00:03:26,720
Look, sweetheart. See?

13
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,355
That's delicious.

14
00:03:28,355 --> 00:03:30,690
It's not spicy at all.

15
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:32,092
Jeff...

16
00:03:32,092 --> 00:03:35,195
Come on. I rest my case.

17
00:03:35,195 --> 00:03:36,930
Isn't she great?

18
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:39,899
She's great. You're great.

19
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:45,272
They said
their name was Truman?

20
00:03:45,272 --> 00:03:47,274
-Newman.
-Ah, Newman.

21
00:03:47,274 --> 00:03:49,776
You better get out of there.

22
00:03:49,776 --> 00:03:52,379
Hey, Newman.

23
00:03:52,379 --> 00:03:54,147
Isn't New Orleans great?

24
00:03:54,147 --> 00:03:56,016
Great.
Would you like a beer?

25
00:03:56,016 --> 00:03:57,651
-Sure.
-Two, please.

26
00:03:57,651 --> 00:04:00,086
-Do you folks travel much?
-A lot. Yeah.

27
00:04:00,086 --> 00:04:03,189
We've cut down
ever since the baby.

28
00:04:03,189 --> 00:04:05,292
What line are you in?

29
00:04:05,292 --> 00:04:09,396
Brain surgery.
Professional brain surgery.

30
00:04:09,396 --> 00:04:11,364
That's a hell of a field.
Challenging.

31
00:04:11,364 --> 00:04:14,634
Actually, I'm thinking
about giving it up.

32
00:04:14,634 --> 00:04:16,703
The racket's getting to me.

33
00:04:16,703 --> 00:04:19,372
I was working with patients
who'd undergone severe trauma...

34
00:04:19,372 --> 00:04:22,976
to the patella,
here in the front of the brain.

35
00:04:22,976 --> 00:04:26,780
You get whacked there,
you start going in circles...

36
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:28,682
lose all sense of direction.

37
00:04:28,682 --> 00:04:30,517
I read about that
in ''People'' magazine.

38
00:04:30,517 --> 00:04:34,487
You did? The pressure
started getting to me.

39
00:04:34,487 --> 00:04:37,924
My hands started shaking.
Dropping scalpels everywhere.

40
00:04:37,924 --> 00:04:40,560
Somebody's pulling our leg.

41
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,663
-Almost had you.
-Not me.

42
00:04:43,663 --> 00:04:47,334
-What do you really do?
-We're in espionage.

43
00:04:47,334 --> 00:04:52,906
-Were. We're retired.
-And that's the truth.

44
00:04:52,906 --> 00:04:56,109
I love crashing parties.

45
00:04:56,109 --> 00:04:57,911
You didn't know those people?

46
00:04:57,911 --> 00:05:00,847
-They didn't know us, either.
-You guys are too much.

47
00:05:00,847 --> 00:05:05,443
-You ain't seen nothing yet.
-Oh, yeah, Mr. Spy?

48
00:05:06,853 --> 00:05:09,723
You're not planning on
smoking that in the room?

49
00:05:09,723 --> 00:05:11,658
I certainly am...

50
00:05:11,658 --> 00:05:14,027
not planning on smoking
this in the room.

51
00:05:14,027 --> 00:05:17,631
-I'll Jane for a walk.
-Louise.

52
00:05:17,631 --> 00:05:19,466
Get some formula
while you're out?

53
00:05:19,466 --> 00:05:21,368
Sure. Night, folks.

54
00:05:21,368 --> 00:05:23,103
Bye-bye.
I'm with you.

55
00:05:23,103 --> 00:05:25,405
I'd never let Vern smoke
a cigar in the room.

56
00:05:25,405 --> 00:05:26,906
Jane Louise!

57
00:05:26,906 --> 00:05:29,909
Is her name Jane Louise
or Louise Jane?

58
00:05:29,909 --> 00:05:31,411
We can't agree.

59
00:05:31,411 --> 00:05:36,916
I think it's strange to name
a girl after her mother.

60
00:05:36,916 --> 00:05:40,320
Men do it all the time,
name the boys after themselves.

61
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,821
Why not the women?

62
00:05:41,821 --> 00:05:45,492
Sweetheart,
why don't we let them decide?

63
00:05:45,492 --> 00:05:47,994
By the time I finish this...

64
00:05:47,994 --> 00:05:50,519
it'll be ready
for my child's child.

65
00:05:58,171 --> 00:06:00,874
What are you doing?

66
00:06:00,874 --> 00:06:03,570
Help! Don't hurt me!

67
00:06:04,678 --> 00:06:08,079
Don't forget the watch.
Shut up, fat boy.

68
00:06:11,317 --> 00:06:15,955
My name is Muerte!
Don't you forget that.

69
00:06:15,955 --> 00:06:17,388
Can we go?

70
00:06:25,098 --> 00:06:27,567
Come on, man!

71
00:06:27,567 --> 00:06:30,203
-l want to go home.
-No, no, no.

72
00:06:30,203 --> 00:06:32,739
That's three.
Let's call it a night.

73
00:06:32,739 --> 00:06:34,974
-Not yet!
-There's going to be cops.

74
00:06:34,974 --> 00:06:39,312
No! I want one more.

75
00:06:39,312 --> 00:06:41,481
Damn.

76
00:06:41,481 --> 00:06:43,540
And here he comes.

77
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:50,223
Relax, guys,
the baby won't hurt you.

78
00:06:50,223 --> 00:06:53,193
Give me the wallet
and the watch.

79
00:06:53,193 --> 00:06:55,995
Look, this is a real baby.

80
00:06:55,995 --> 00:06:57,497
I don't want any trouble.

81
00:06:57,497 --> 00:06:58,987
Then hand it over.

82
00:07:06,272 --> 00:07:07,907
Let's go. The watch.

83
00:07:07,907 --> 00:07:09,602
It's a Swatch.

84
00:07:13,847 --> 00:07:16,509
Are we finished? Can I go?

85
00:07:19,786 --> 00:07:21,621
We had a deal.

86
00:07:21,621 --> 00:07:23,816
You commit a felony.
I go.

87
00:07:30,063 --> 00:07:34,734
My name is Muerte.

88
00:07:34,734 --> 00:07:38,304
Pleased to meet you, Morty.
My name is Jeff.

89
00:07:38,304 --> 00:07:40,465
Ozzie! Cut him!

90
00:07:49,816 --> 00:07:52,341
This is a really bad idea,
Morty.

91
00:08:00,693 --> 00:08:04,288
You sleep through anything,
don't you, honey?

92
00:08:05,298 --> 00:08:07,357
I'll kill you, asshole.

93
00:08:13,873 --> 00:08:16,142
You sucker.

94
00:08:16,142 --> 00:08:18,702
En garde. Parry. Thrust!

95
00:08:22,448 --> 00:08:26,942
It's a very fortunate thing
for you my wife wasn't here.

96
00:08:29,255 --> 00:08:32,959
My good girl, isn't she?

97
00:08:32,959 --> 00:08:34,460
Yeah.

98
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:35,950
Lovely evening, isn't it?

99
00:08:43,603 --> 00:08:46,973
Hi, honey.
Did you get the formula?

100
00:08:46,973 --> 00:08:48,608
I completely forgot.

101
00:08:48,608 --> 00:08:51,711
-Daydreaming?
-Obviously.

102
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:54,874
Jeff?
What happened to the stroller?

103
00:08:59,219 --> 00:09:02,488
It's a bad world,
isn't it, sweetheart?

104
00:09:02,488 --> 00:09:06,424
You and me and Mom
are going to make it better.

105
00:09:30,984 --> 00:09:32,719
New Orleans Police Department.

106
00:09:32,719 --> 00:09:36,422
Did you see a gentleman
with a baby stroller?

107
00:09:36,422 --> 00:09:40,026
That's Mr. Blue.
He's upstairs in his room.

108
00:09:40,026 --> 00:09:41,357
Thank you very much.

109
00:09:43,796 --> 00:09:45,398
What did happen
to that stroller?

110
00:09:45,398 --> 00:09:47,467
Put something on.
The cops are coming.

111
00:09:47,467 --> 00:09:51,437
-The cops are coming?
-Big badges, blue uniforms.

112
00:09:51,437 --> 00:09:52,631
Why?

113
00:09:58,177 --> 00:09:59,712
Officers.

114
00:09:59,712 --> 00:10:02,582
-Jeff Blue?
-That's me.

115
00:10:02,582 --> 00:10:05,118
Lieutenant Theodore Sawyer,
New Orleans Police Department.

116
00:10:05,118 --> 00:10:07,120
This is
Detective Sergeant Halsey.

117
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:10,089
That's Halsey.
S-e-y, not s-y.

118
00:10:10,089 --> 00:10:11,591
May we come in?

119
00:10:11,591 --> 00:10:13,786
Sure thing, Ted.
You bet. My pleasure.

120
00:10:16,296 --> 00:10:20,033
I'm a great admirer
of the New Orleans Police.

121
00:10:20,033 --> 00:10:23,002
How's Clay Shaw?

122
00:10:23,002 --> 00:10:25,738
That's really hilarious.

123
00:10:25,738 --> 00:10:28,508
-This is my wife Jane.
-Evening.

124
00:10:28,508 --> 00:10:30,510
This is Lieutenant Sawyer.

125
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:32,512
-Lieutenant.
-Sergeant Halsey.

126
00:10:32,512 --> 00:10:33,713
-Sergeant.
-Ma'am.

127
00:10:33,713 --> 00:10:35,515
Please excuse the robe,
gentlemen.

128
00:10:35,515 --> 00:10:38,651
I wasn't expecting the police
at this hour.

129
00:10:38,651 --> 00:10:40,720
Please, sit.

130
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:44,023
Excuse us, ma'am.
We're working undercover--

131
00:10:44,023 --> 00:10:46,726
A lieutenant undercover?
I would have thought...

132
00:10:46,726 --> 00:10:49,963
they'd have something
more important for you.

133
00:10:49,963 --> 00:10:51,597
With oil gone belly-up...

134
00:10:51,597 --> 00:10:53,499
tourism is
the biggest stuff there is.

135
00:10:53,499 --> 00:10:56,736
Folks getting knifed
in the French Quarter...

136
00:10:56,736 --> 00:11:01,341
annoys the hell out of
the Tourist Commission.

137
00:11:01,341 --> 00:11:05,078
There was an attempted
mugging this evening.

138
00:11:05,078 --> 00:11:06,312
Really?

139
00:11:06,312 --> 00:11:08,781
-The victim got away.
-Oh, good.

140
00:11:08,781 --> 00:11:11,951
-You know nothing about that?
-No.

141
00:11:11,951 --> 00:11:13,987
You match the description
of the intended victim--

142
00:11:13,987 --> 00:11:16,089
a man with a baby stroller.

143
00:11:16,089 --> 00:11:20,360
A bag lady says she saw
the man enter this hotel.

144
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:22,528
The desk clerk
says that man was you.

145
00:11:22,528 --> 00:11:25,465
Certainly narrows it down,
doesn't it?

146
00:11:25,465 --> 00:11:29,736
Mr. Blue, were you involved
in an attempted mugging?

147
00:11:29,736 --> 00:11:32,405
No, Ted, I don't think so.

148
00:11:32,405 --> 00:11:34,307
Would you mind
calling me Lieutenant?

149
00:11:34,307 --> 00:11:37,710
Ms. Blue...

150
00:11:37,710 --> 00:11:40,235
would you care
to make any comment?

151
00:11:42,015 --> 00:11:44,313
Not at this precise time.

152
00:11:48,154 --> 00:11:50,523
Mr. Blue,
can I see some ID, please?

153
00:11:50,523 --> 00:11:53,860
-You bet.
-One with a picture?

154
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:55,995
Thank you.

155
00:11:55,995 --> 00:11:58,031
That's a good picture.

156
00:11:58,031 --> 00:11:59,766
What do you do for a living?

157
00:11:59,766 --> 00:12:01,534
I'm an Electrolux salesman.

158
00:12:01,534 --> 00:12:04,804
I don't know what brand
of vacuum cleaner you use...

159
00:12:04,804 --> 00:12:07,974
but the Electrolux
is the biggest sucker of all.

160
00:12:07,974 --> 00:12:10,877
Are you in New Orleans
on business?

161
00:12:10,877 --> 00:12:13,646
-Vacation.
-How long will you stay?

162
00:12:13,646 --> 00:12:16,916
Month, month and a half.

163
00:12:16,916 --> 00:12:18,684
Isn't that long for a vacation?

164
00:12:18,684 --> 00:12:20,887
Is it?

165
00:12:20,887 --> 00:12:24,223
Mr. Blue, if...

166
00:12:24,223 --> 00:12:25,625
If you know something...

167
00:12:25,625 --> 00:12:27,560
but you're afraid
to talk about it...

168
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:29,829
we can give you
full protection.

169
00:12:29,829 --> 00:12:33,599
Thanks, but I really
don't know anything.

170
00:12:33,599 --> 00:12:35,568
Well, thank you, sir.

171
00:12:35,568 --> 00:12:38,704
Here's your ID,
and here's my card.

172
00:12:38,704 --> 00:12:41,240
If you change your mind,
please give us a call.

173
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:43,910
-Will do.
-Bye, ma'am.

174
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:47,080
That baby stroller's
taken quite a beating.

175
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:49,982
Baggage handlers.

176
00:12:49,982 --> 00:12:52,007
-Good night.
-Good night.

177
00:12:56,622 --> 00:13:00,026
Let me see if
I understand this correctly.

178
00:13:00,026 --> 00:13:02,428
You took our child
into a knife fight?

179
00:13:02,428 --> 00:13:05,531
It was a fair fight--
two of them, two of us.

180
00:13:05,531 --> 00:13:07,467
Jeff, how could you?

181
00:13:07,467 --> 00:13:09,235
It wasn't my idea.

182
00:13:09,235 --> 00:13:11,471
You should have seen them,
complete amateurs.

183
00:13:11,471 --> 00:13:14,841
Biggest risk was I'd fall down
laughing and hurt myself.

184
00:13:14,841 --> 00:13:17,977
I won't do it again.

185
00:13:17,977 --> 00:13:20,480
This is Chapter Two
in which Jeff and Jane...

186
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:23,983
have a child
and lead a normal life.

187
00:13:23,983 --> 00:13:25,507
You forgot the formula.

188
00:13:30,957 --> 00:13:32,982
That's my boy, Metre.

189
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:38,491
I'm going to fuck him up.
Watch this. Hold my stick.

190
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:42,568
Boy, this is gonna be good.

191
00:13:42,568 --> 00:13:45,505
-Red.
-What can I do you?

192
00:13:45,505 --> 00:13:49,008
-Creme de menthe.
-Coming up.

193
00:13:49,008 --> 00:13:54,080
Hey, Muerte,
I heard you had some trouble.

194
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:56,516
Yeah. You should
see the other guys--

195
00:13:56,516 --> 00:14:00,119
fifteen guys
with chains and dogs.

196
00:14:00,119 --> 00:14:02,952
You should see
what they look like.

197
00:14:03,956 --> 00:14:05,992
I mean...

198
00:14:05,992 --> 00:14:08,327
That ain't what I heard.

199
00:14:08,327 --> 00:14:11,464
I heard it was one guy...

200
00:14:11,464 --> 00:14:13,966
with a cute little tiny baby!

201
00:14:13,966 --> 00:14:16,869
Which one of them
done it to you, Muerte?

202
00:14:16,869 --> 00:14:18,471
Was it the guy...

203
00:14:18,471 --> 00:14:21,201
or that cute little tiny baby?

204
00:14:23,943 --> 00:14:25,978
My name is Muerte!

205
00:14:25,978 --> 00:14:27,605
My name is Death!

206
00:14:32,818 --> 00:14:35,488
Don't you forget that!

207
00:14:35,488 --> 00:14:38,224
Scumhooks!

208
00:14:38,224 --> 00:14:40,493
So now he's looking for Blue.

209
00:14:40,493 --> 00:14:44,096
Great. Muerte's going
to be out for blood.

210
00:14:44,096 --> 00:14:45,998
He's a vindictive
little shit, Captain.

211
00:14:45,998 --> 00:14:48,000
Then you find him first.

212
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,869
That's not all.

213
00:14:49,869 --> 00:14:52,004
There's something strange
about this guy Blue...

214
00:14:52,004 --> 00:14:53,906
what he did to
Muerte and Ozzie.

215
00:14:53,906 --> 00:14:56,876
He was holding a baby,
so he did it one-handed.

216
00:14:56,876 --> 00:14:58,878
What are you saying?

217
00:14:58,878 --> 00:15:01,013
It takes special training.

218
00:15:01,013 --> 00:15:04,951
What I'm wondering is,
who is this guy? FBI?

219
00:15:04,951 --> 00:15:07,353
I don't think the FBI
is running anything...

220
00:15:07,353 --> 00:15:09,455
but you know how much
they tell us.

221
00:15:09,455 --> 00:15:11,457
There's a guy
I knew in the service...

222
00:15:11,457 --> 00:15:13,459
works with the Bureau in D.C.

223
00:15:13,459 --> 00:15:15,361
Maybe I should check it out.

224
00:15:15,361 --> 00:15:17,797
Stop wondering
and check it out.

225
00:15:17,797 --> 00:15:18,991
Right.

226
00:15:25,238 --> 00:15:28,441
FBI?
Dan Chesler, please.

227
00:15:28,441 --> 00:15:30,739
-His line is busy.
-I'll wait.

228
00:15:33,813 --> 00:15:35,648
Come on!

229
00:15:35,648 --> 00:15:37,850
-Chesler.
-Hey, Danny.

230
00:15:37,850 --> 00:15:40,486
Ted Sawyer here.
How you doing?

231
00:15:40,486 --> 00:15:43,489
Listen, ran into somebody
unusual down here.

232
00:15:43,489 --> 00:15:45,191
Was wondering if
he could be one of yours?

233
00:15:45,191 --> 00:15:47,489
Calls himself Jefferson Blue.

234
00:15:49,662 --> 00:15:52,028
Did I say something funny?

235
00:15:52,064 --> 00:15:55,001
-I'm dying.
-It wasn't that far.

236
00:15:55,001 --> 00:15:57,663
-20 miles.
-That's far.

237
00:16:00,006 --> 00:16:01,735
Hold it.

238
00:16:23,796 --> 00:16:25,286
Stay put, pumpkin.

239
00:16:31,971 --> 00:16:36,309
One man on
the couch...reading.

240
00:16:36,309 --> 00:16:37,977
A literate burglar?

241
00:16:37,977 --> 00:16:42,014
How refreshing.
Reading what?

242
00:16:42,014 --> 00:16:44,983
Go for the far wall.
I'll cover you from here.

243
00:16:53,159 --> 00:16:55,928
One...

244
00:16:55,928 --> 00:16:59,298
Two...

245
00:16:59,298 --> 00:17:01,357
Three.

246
00:17:03,569 --> 00:17:06,439
Jeff! Jeff!

247
00:17:06,439 --> 00:17:10,170
Frank! How are you doing?

248
00:17:15,014 --> 00:17:17,483
Did we ever thank you
for the crib blanket?

249
00:17:17,483 --> 00:17:20,453
No, honey. The White House
sent the crib blanket.

250
00:17:20,453 --> 00:17:22,722
Frank sent
the Fisher-Price barnyard.

251
00:17:22,722 --> 00:17:24,323
You sent that?

252
00:17:24,323 --> 00:17:26,892
Do you know those
little cows really moo?

253
00:17:26,892 --> 00:17:28,894
Jeff always plays with it
day and night.

254
00:17:28,894 --> 00:17:31,130
I'd like you
to consider something.

255
00:17:31,130 --> 00:17:33,532
-The answer is no.
-You haven't heard the question.

256
00:17:33,532 --> 00:17:34,734
The answer is still no.

257
00:17:34,734 --> 00:17:37,169
Whatever you want,
we're not interested.

258
00:17:37,169 --> 00:17:38,938
We're off
the field assignment list.

259
00:17:38,938 --> 00:17:43,042
Maternity leave.
You gave us a very nice party.

260
00:17:43,042 --> 00:17:47,713
You said if we were in
a critical situation--

261
00:17:47,713 --> 00:17:49,515
Not during
the first 18 months.

262
00:17:49,515 --> 00:17:54,019
The books all show the first
18 months are essential--

263
00:17:54,019 --> 00:17:56,010
Jesus.

264
00:17:57,990 --> 00:18:00,326
-Tactical nuke?
-C-22.

265
00:18:00,326 --> 00:18:02,762
-We are not interested.
-''C'' what?

266
00:18:02,762 --> 00:18:04,397
Experimental
plastic explosive...

267
00:18:04,397 --> 00:18:06,332
the most powerful plastic
ever developed.

268
00:18:06,332 --> 00:18:08,934
So unstable even the Army
won't use it.

269
00:18:08,934 --> 00:18:10,436
That C-22.

270
00:18:10,436 --> 00:18:11,771
I thought
they stopped making it.

271
00:18:11,771 --> 00:18:13,372
They did.
The remaining stock was stolen.

272
00:18:13,372 --> 00:18:16,876
-Sell it to someone else.
-Please.

273
00:18:16,876 --> 00:18:18,944
FBI thinks
it's organized crime.

274
00:18:18,944 --> 00:18:20,946
FBI thinks everything's
organized crime.

275
00:18:20,946 --> 00:18:22,448
We think it's Novacek.

276
00:18:22,448 --> 00:18:24,950
Novacek?
We're incredibly not interested.

277
00:18:24,950 --> 00:18:27,453
She hates me.
Remember Budapest?

278
00:18:27,453 --> 00:18:28,788
You said
you'd help out a little.

279
00:18:28,788 --> 00:18:32,992
Novacek is not a little.
She's a psycho.

280
00:18:32,992 --> 00:18:35,027
Novacek's customers
make their points...

281
00:18:35,027 --> 00:18:37,930
by blowing up innocent people,
including children.

282
00:18:37,930 --> 00:18:39,932
That's a low blow.

283
00:18:39,932 --> 00:18:44,136
Just find her.
We'll do the rest.

284
00:18:44,136 --> 00:18:46,472
You get six months paid leave
when you finish.

285
00:18:46,472 --> 00:18:48,641
That ought to help
the postnatal bonding.

286
00:18:48,641 --> 00:18:51,744
Uh-uh. Just going to have
to find somebody else.

287
00:18:51,744 --> 00:18:55,481
We'll throw in a bonus.
20% of annual pay.

288
00:18:55,481 --> 00:18:57,483
I made a solemn promise
to Jane--

289
00:18:57,483 --> 00:18:59,618
-Fifty percent.
-Don't push it.

290
00:18:59,618 --> 00:19:00,886
I'm a mother now.

291
00:19:00,886 --> 00:19:03,422
Know what a decent college
will cost in 20 years?

292
00:19:03,422 --> 00:19:05,524
Thirty. I'm already
way over budget.

293
00:19:05,524 --> 00:19:07,092
Fifty, going once.

294
00:19:07,092 --> 00:19:08,828
You mercenary thing, you.

295
00:19:08,828 --> 00:19:10,729
Going twice.

296
00:19:10,729 --> 00:19:13,232
I want a low-profile operation.

297
00:19:13,232 --> 00:19:16,735
You want low-profile,
you got low-profile.

298
00:19:16,735 --> 00:19:19,829
-We'll need the usual toys.
-They're on the way.

299
00:19:19,939 --> 00:19:22,741
You got one lead--
this guy Foster.

300
00:19:22,741 --> 00:19:26,278
He works at Dynagon.
They developed C-22.

301
00:19:26,278 --> 00:19:29,849
-Can you say plastic explosive?
-Pay attention.

302
00:19:29,849 --> 00:19:33,285
I'm paying attention.
Go on.

303
00:19:33,285 --> 00:19:35,921
Novacek's base
is somewhere in the delta.

304
00:19:35,921 --> 00:19:38,958
She's got her people spotted
in local defence industries...

305
00:19:38,958 --> 00:19:40,459
even the military.

306
00:19:40,459 --> 00:19:41,961
More good news.

307
00:19:41,961 --> 00:19:44,463
Near as we can tell,
she bribed a full colonel...

308
00:19:44,463 --> 00:19:46,999
into stealing the last batch
of C-22 canisters.

309
00:19:46,999 --> 00:19:49,935
He got spooked
and used one getting away.

310
00:19:49,935 --> 00:19:53,506
Blew up half of Oklahoma.
Be careful, guys.

311
00:19:53,506 --> 00:19:55,574
Novacek's more dangerous
than she looks.

312
00:19:55,574 --> 00:19:57,309
Colonel!

313
00:19:57,309 --> 00:20:00,244
How happy I am to see you.

314
00:20:03,816 --> 00:20:06,085
You're limping.
Did you have some problems?

315
00:20:06,085 --> 00:20:09,522
-Nothing I couldn't handle.
-What happened?

316
00:20:09,522 --> 00:20:12,191
There was a last-minute change
in checkpoint security.

317
00:20:12,191 --> 00:20:15,594
-What?
-There's one missing.

318
00:20:15,594 --> 00:20:18,597
-Missing?
-That's what I'm saying.

319
00:20:18,597 --> 00:20:21,667
They were bringing in
tanks and artillery.

320
00:20:21,667 --> 00:20:24,003
You used
1/5 of our shipment...

321
00:20:24,003 --> 00:20:28,140
just to--Oh, God--
to blast yourself out?

322
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:31,877
It was the only way out.
I know they're valuable.

323
00:20:31,877 --> 00:20:33,879
Colonel...

324
00:20:33,879 --> 00:20:37,049
Big, strong, colonel man.

325
00:20:37,049 --> 00:20:39,585
I know you're the only one
I can trust.

326
00:20:39,585 --> 00:20:42,555
Don't ma'am me.
Just call me Paulina.

327
00:20:42,555 --> 00:20:44,123
Paulina, ma'am.

328
00:20:44,123 --> 00:20:46,725
You just call me--Oops.

329
00:20:46,725 --> 00:20:49,159
-I'll get that.
-Unforgettable.

330
00:20:52,364 --> 00:20:55,856
The colonel will no longer
be working with us.

331
00:20:57,036 --> 00:20:59,038
The FBI fired Blue twice?

332
00:20:59,038 --> 00:21:01,974
Fired him in '81.
Rehired him in '84.

333
00:21:01,974 --> 00:21:04,476
-Fired him again in '85.
-Why?

334
00:21:04,476 --> 00:21:05,978
There's all kinds of rumours.

335
00:21:05,978 --> 00:21:08,080
Tell him what he did
in-between.

336
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:09,982
I'm going to hate this,
ain't I?

337
00:21:09,982 --> 00:21:11,984
-CIA.
-Perfect.

338
00:21:11,984 --> 00:21:14,987
Till they got on the bandwagon
and fired him, too.

339
00:21:14,987 --> 00:21:17,489
-Who's he with now?
-Very good question.

340
00:21:17,489 --> 00:21:19,480
-Go find out!
-Yes, sir.

341
00:21:23,495 --> 00:21:25,486
Mr. Foster?

342
00:21:27,099 --> 00:21:30,002
You. What do you want?

343
00:21:30,002 --> 00:21:33,505
Frau Novacek shall require
your services again.

344
00:21:33,505 --> 00:21:36,508
No, no. I can't be
involved with that anymore.

345
00:21:36,508 --> 00:21:38,510
I mean...you know.

346
00:21:38,510 --> 00:21:40,613
You got no choice, little man.

347
00:21:40,613 --> 00:21:43,515
Please deliver the merchandise
at the usual place.

348
00:21:43,515 --> 00:21:46,848
Oh, God! When?

349
00:21:46,885 --> 00:21:50,522
''Gilbert Foster,
2616 Magazine Street.

350
00:21:50,522 --> 00:21:54,526
''Occupation--research scientist

351
00:21:54,526 --> 00:21:59,231
"Dishonorable discharge.
Marital status--divorced.''

352
00:21:59,231 --> 00:22:00,466
Yoo-hoo, Ms. Blue!

353
00:22:00,466 --> 00:22:02,525
Heads up.

354
00:22:04,937 --> 00:22:06,495
Laurel and Hardy.

355
00:22:07,973 --> 00:22:10,342
Well, the Blues.

356
00:22:10,342 --> 00:22:13,178
I got a right
to sing the blues

357
00:22:13,178 --> 00:22:14,813
Charming.

358
00:22:14,813 --> 00:22:18,017
Cute baby. Boy or girl?

359
00:22:18,017 --> 00:22:19,318
Gosh, I hope so.

360
00:22:19,318 --> 00:22:20,819
She's a girl, Lieutenant.

361
00:22:20,819 --> 00:22:22,154
I got two girls.

362
00:22:22,154 --> 00:22:24,990
-Really? Two whole girls.
-We tried for a boy.

363
00:22:24,990 --> 00:22:27,493
-Coffee?
-I'd love some cafe au lait.

364
00:22:27,493 --> 00:22:28,994
Great.

365
00:22:28,994 --> 00:22:31,497
Mr. Blue,
could we talk frankly?

366
00:22:31,497 --> 00:22:33,399
Sure, Ted.

367
00:22:33,399 --> 00:22:35,834
What you did
to those two guys--

368
00:22:35,834 --> 00:22:38,103
What did you say you did
for a living?

369
00:22:38,103 --> 00:22:39,638
I'm an airline pilot.

370
00:22:39,638 --> 00:22:41,507
You said you're
a vacuum cleaner salesman.

371
00:22:41,507 --> 00:22:44,408
If you knew, why'd you ask?

372
00:22:47,012 --> 00:22:51,016
What you did to those guys
was on a professional level.

373
00:22:51,016 --> 00:22:53,519
Growing up
in the mean streets--

374
00:22:53,519 --> 00:22:55,554
Mean streets?
You're from Nebraska.

375
00:22:55,554 --> 00:22:57,556
How did you know
where Jeff was from?

376
00:22:57,556 --> 00:23:00,959
Had a little chat with
somebody from the FBI.

377
00:23:00,959 --> 00:23:04,229
The man has unexpected depths.

378
00:23:04,229 --> 00:23:05,664
What else did you find out?

379
00:23:05,664 --> 00:23:07,633
Nothing about our sex life,
I hope.

380
00:23:07,633 --> 00:23:08,967
I'm going to blush.

381
00:23:08,967 --> 00:23:10,969
You weren't blushing last night.

382
00:23:10,969 --> 00:23:12,304
I was blushing all over.

383
00:23:12,304 --> 00:23:15,407
-Oh, yeah.
-Everywhere.

384
00:23:15,407 --> 00:23:19,745
My source at the FBI says
they didn't think you were...

385
00:23:19,745 --> 00:23:23,182
and I quote,
''Bureau material.''

386
00:23:23,182 --> 00:23:26,785
That's true.
I'm more of an end table.

387
00:23:26,785 --> 00:23:29,054
I always think of you
as a dining room chair.

388
00:23:29,054 --> 00:23:31,757
Really? I see you as
a rosewood armoire...

389
00:23:31,757 --> 00:23:34,658
with really nice drawers.

390
00:23:36,161 --> 00:23:38,664
-Blue!
-What?

391
00:23:38,664 --> 00:23:42,334
Who are you working for?
Are you a spy?

392
00:23:42,334 --> 00:23:45,871
It don't have to go beyond me.

393
00:23:45,871 --> 00:23:48,373
I can help you. Trust me.

394
00:23:48,373 --> 00:23:50,642
-Know what's funny?
-What?

395
00:23:50,642 --> 00:23:53,112
That gray van over there.

396
00:23:53,112 --> 00:23:55,414
Funny ha-ha
or funny interesting?

397
00:23:55,414 --> 00:23:57,850
Have you been listening to me?

398
00:23:57,850 --> 00:24:00,819
It's been there seven minutes
with the motor running.

399
00:24:00,819 --> 00:24:03,655
-So what?
-It's in front of a bank.

400
00:24:03,655 --> 00:24:06,425
I repeat--so what?

401
00:24:06,425 --> 00:24:07,915
Order me another coffee.

402
00:24:09,461 --> 00:24:11,396
He's so rude sometimes.

403
00:24:11,396 --> 00:24:13,330
I'm sorry.
I just have to apologize.

404
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:36,387
Excuse me.

405
00:24:37,456 --> 00:24:39,625
Honey, you got to see this.

406
00:24:39,625 --> 00:24:41,593
Come see what Daddy's doing.

407
00:24:45,330 --> 00:24:47,332
Let's go! Go, man!

408
00:24:47,332 --> 00:24:50,028
Go, God damn it! Go!

409
00:25:00,012 --> 00:25:01,914
Oh, wow!

410
00:25:01,914 --> 00:25:04,940
Next time, buy American.

411
00:25:07,252 --> 00:25:11,657
Mrs. Blue, can we stop
with the fun and games?

412
00:25:11,657 --> 00:25:14,459
First try.

413
00:25:14,459 --> 00:25:16,829
Give me five.

414
00:25:16,829 --> 00:25:19,464
Who is your husband
working for now?

415
00:25:19,464 --> 00:25:21,900
If you'd like to know
who my husband is working for...

416
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:23,669
I suggest you ask him.

417
00:25:23,669 --> 00:25:26,972
I am outraged
that he single-handedly...

418
00:25:26,972 --> 00:25:30,475
foils a bank robbery
and you arrest him.

419
00:25:30,475 --> 00:25:32,477
You got a lot of goddamn gall.

420
00:25:32,477 --> 00:25:34,379
We got your husband
behind bars...

421
00:25:34,379 --> 00:25:36,648
and he'll stay there
until somebody tells me...

422
00:25:36,648 --> 00:25:38,917
exactly what
he's doing in my city!

423
00:25:38,917 --> 00:25:41,887
You are overreacting.
Isn't he, honey?

424
00:25:41,887 --> 00:25:43,488
Men are like that.

425
00:25:43,488 --> 00:25:45,991
They get threatened,
then they get defensive...

426
00:25:45,991 --> 00:25:47,993
and then
they get aggressive--

427
00:25:47,993 --> 00:25:49,995
Ma'am, if you don't watch it...

428
00:25:49,995 --> 00:25:54,333
you'll find yourself in a cell,
baby or no baby.

429
00:25:54,333 --> 00:25:56,001
Excuse me, sir.
Phone call for you.

430
00:25:56,001 --> 00:25:58,170
-I'm busy.
-OK.

431
00:25:58,170 --> 00:26:00,873
I'm going to ask you
one more time very nicely--

432
00:26:00,873 --> 00:26:02,674
It's about Blue, sir.

433
00:26:02,674 --> 00:26:05,510
Who is it, the president?

434
00:26:05,510 --> 00:26:07,613
No.

435
00:26:07,613 --> 00:26:09,478
It's the governor.

436
00:26:11,216 --> 00:26:15,053
About that stunt you pulled
with the car just now...

437
00:26:15,053 --> 00:26:17,456
is that part
of Chapter Two...

438
00:26:17,456 --> 00:26:20,459
in which Jeff and Jane
lead a sane life?

439
00:26:20,459 --> 00:26:22,461
I don't think
it's fair or nice of you...

440
00:26:22,461 --> 00:26:24,463
to complain about me
having a little fun.

441
00:26:24,463 --> 00:26:25,831
There was a zero risk factor.

442
00:26:25,831 --> 00:26:27,532
Three guys
running out of a bank...

443
00:26:27,532 --> 00:26:29,167
packing heat,
probably stoned.

444
00:26:29,167 --> 00:26:31,436
People in a hurry
never look at the driver.

445
00:26:31,436 --> 00:26:33,038
I've never
heard that rule before.

446
00:26:33,038 --> 00:26:35,974
I made it up,
but it's still true.

447
00:26:35,974 --> 00:26:38,110
And it's all part of
my brilliant plan.

448
00:26:38,110 --> 00:26:39,478
Which brilliant plan?

449
00:26:39,478 --> 00:26:40,979
Take a look at this.

450
00:26:40,979 --> 00:26:42,981
This guy at Dynagon,
Foster...

451
00:26:42,981 --> 00:26:45,347
he's worth spooking,
so tomorrow, what we do...

452
00:26:52,991 --> 00:26:55,994
Would you get that?
My hands are all gooey.

453
00:26:55,994 --> 00:26:58,330
Yeah.

454
00:26:58,330 --> 00:27:02,034
-Hello. Speaking.
-This Blue?

455
00:27:02,034 --> 00:27:04,703
Do you remember me?

456
00:27:04,703 --> 00:27:06,939
You have a really sexy voice...

457
00:27:06,939 --> 00:27:08,941
but, hey,
I'm a happily married man.

458
00:27:08,941 --> 00:27:11,443
You'll be a dead man soon.

459
00:27:11,443 --> 00:27:14,379
Who is this again?

460
00:27:14,379 --> 00:27:16,815
This is Muerte.

461
00:27:16,815 --> 00:27:18,250
Morty!

462
00:27:18,250 --> 00:27:21,620
No! No Morty!
Muerte! Death!

463
00:27:21,620 --> 00:27:24,256
Yeah, right. Death.

464
00:27:24,256 --> 00:27:26,959
That's right.
I'm coming for you, man...

465
00:27:26,959 --> 00:27:29,728
and I'm going to kill you.

466
00:27:29,728 --> 00:27:33,198
Morty, it's late.
What's the bottom line?

467
00:27:33,198 --> 00:27:37,669
The bottom line is
you're gonna die, man...ugly.

468
00:27:37,669 --> 00:27:42,941
Morty, do me a favour.
Don't call here anymore...

469
00:27:42,941 --> 00:27:46,445
unless you want to have
a serious conversation.

470
00:27:46,445 --> 00:27:49,314
Excuse me! No! Hello?

471
00:27:49,314 --> 00:27:51,316
-Who was that?
-That was Morty.

472
00:27:51,316 --> 00:27:53,085
Muerte. How nice.

473
00:27:53,085 --> 00:27:55,815
-He'll be very useful.
-Boy, are you optimistic.

474
00:28:26,985 --> 00:28:29,180
Dynagon Industries.

475
00:28:33,392 --> 00:28:35,394
You wanted to see me?

476
00:28:35,394 --> 00:28:39,564
Yes, Mr. Foster.
My name is Hildy Johnson.

477
00:28:39,564 --> 00:28:40,899
I'm with
the ''Chicago Herald.''

478
00:28:40,899 --> 00:28:44,269
I'm working on a story about
the theft of defence secrets.

479
00:28:44,269 --> 00:28:50,242
I have absolutely no comment
to make on this matter.

480
00:28:50,242 --> 00:28:54,179
Really? How about
a big front-page photo?

481
00:28:54,179 --> 00:28:55,380
Oh, God!

482
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:59,111
I think you should leave,
sir, right now.

483
00:29:04,589 --> 00:29:07,456
Run back the tape
from reception.

484
00:29:16,034 --> 00:29:17,501
Stop it right there.

485
00:29:20,238 --> 00:29:22,331
Print.

486
00:29:33,852 --> 00:29:35,954
Mr. Ferderber, please.

487
00:29:35,954 --> 00:29:37,956
Yes, I'll wait.

488
00:29:37,956 --> 00:29:40,447
Yeah, right. Yes.

489
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:42,825
Oh, God.

490
00:30:53,598 --> 00:30:56,334
-Jefferson Blue.
-You know him?

491
00:30:56,334 --> 00:31:01,506
Yes. He ruined
the operation in Budapest.

492
00:31:01,506 --> 00:31:04,509
This means everything will
have to be accelerated.

493
00:31:04,509 --> 00:31:07,979
You must make copies of this
and distribute them.

494
00:31:07,979 --> 00:31:09,481
We must get Blue.

495
00:31:09,481 --> 00:31:11,483
Yes, Frau Novacek.

496
00:31:11,483 --> 00:31:13,985
Yeah. Thank you.

497
00:31:13,985 --> 00:31:16,855
Thank you very much.
Here you go, honey.

498
00:31:16,855 --> 00:31:22,160
I told you B.B. King
recorded children's records.

499
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:25,430
There you go.
Let's go find Mommy.

500
00:31:25,430 --> 00:31:27,866
Maybe she'll give us
something to eat.

501
00:31:27,866 --> 00:31:31,503
Hi, Morty. How's it going?

502
00:31:31,503 --> 00:31:34,506
Muerte! For Death!

503
00:31:34,506 --> 00:31:36,141
You die today!

504
00:31:36,141 --> 00:31:41,813
Right. That looks
really great on TV...

505
00:31:41,813 --> 00:31:45,317
but you get better results
if you hold it like--

506
00:31:45,317 --> 00:31:47,085
Shut up!

507
00:31:47,085 --> 00:31:48,520
Do you always have
this much problem...

508
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:51,182
with a little
constructive criticism?

509
00:31:54,826 --> 00:31:56,695
Now what?

510
00:31:56,695 --> 00:31:59,531
Hi, hon.
I told you about Morty.

511
00:31:59,531 --> 00:32:03,468
-Morty, this is Jane.
-Hi, Morty.

512
00:32:03,468 --> 00:32:05,971
I'm sorry, but we've got
so much shopping to do--

513
00:32:05,971 --> 00:32:08,707
Shut up! You die, too!

514
00:32:08,707 --> 00:32:10,038
Oh, for God's sakes.

515
00:32:18,483 --> 00:32:20,075
Oh, no.

516
00:32:22,487 --> 00:32:23,955
Honey.

517
00:32:23,955 --> 00:32:26,253
Come here, Morty.

518
00:32:28,994 --> 00:32:31,529
I can't leave you alone
for a minute.

519
00:32:31,529 --> 00:32:33,365
This wasn't my fault.

520
00:32:33,365 --> 00:32:34,866
Nothing's ever your fault.

521
00:32:34,866 --> 00:32:37,002
You going to kill him?

522
00:32:37,002 --> 00:32:39,004
Aren't we bloodthirsty?

523
00:32:39,004 --> 00:32:42,440
I told you not to drink
all that coffee.

524
00:32:45,577 --> 00:32:47,078
Where are we going to eat?

525
00:32:47,078 --> 00:32:48,847
I heard about this great place
from the Newmans.

526
00:32:48,847 --> 00:32:50,906
They say
the oysters are terrific.

527
00:32:52,017 --> 00:32:54,019
Here we go.

528
00:32:54,019 --> 00:32:56,521
You want to sit here
or in the garden?

529
00:32:56,521 --> 00:32:58,023
-Garden?
-Sure.

530
00:32:58,023 --> 00:32:59,524
That way, please.

531
00:32:59,524 --> 00:33:01,459
Do you think
we'll find Novacek?

532
00:33:01,459 --> 00:33:03,461
Absolutely.
We spooked Foster.

533
00:33:03,461 --> 00:33:05,463
Word gets to Novacek.
Novacek gets worried.

534
00:33:05,463 --> 00:33:07,465
She doesn't know
what move to make.

535
00:33:07,465 --> 00:33:09,467
She's fretful.
She's nervous.

536
00:33:09,467 --> 00:33:11,799
You're describing
a baby with colic.

537
00:33:16,474 --> 00:33:19,978
All right.
What can I get for you folks?

538
00:33:19,978 --> 00:33:22,981
A new acquaintance told me
this was the place for oysters.

539
00:33:22,981 --> 00:33:24,983
Yes, ma'am, it is.

540
00:33:24,983 --> 00:33:28,653
We'll have six dozen oysters
and two beers.

541
00:33:28,653 --> 00:33:30,655
All right, sir. Right away.

542
00:33:30,655 --> 00:33:32,157
You like them, too?

543
00:33:32,157 --> 00:33:33,522
This place is great.

544
00:33:39,931 --> 00:33:42,957
Darling, do the oysters
come with guns?

545
00:33:44,102 --> 00:33:46,771
Don't make any sudden moves.

546
00:33:46,771 --> 00:33:50,008
-Is there a bee on me?
-l don't see one.

547
00:33:50,008 --> 00:33:53,278
What's a sudden move?
I never understood that.

548
00:33:53,278 --> 00:33:56,414
I don't either.
They watch too many cop shows.

549
00:33:56,414 --> 00:34:01,453
Get up from the table
very, very slowly.

550
00:34:01,453 --> 00:34:04,989
Very, very? Not just very?

551
00:34:04,989 --> 00:34:06,558
Start moving.

552
00:34:06,558 --> 00:34:09,561
You remember Marseilles
three, four years ago?

553
00:34:09,561 --> 00:34:10,795
Uh-huh.

554
00:34:10,795 --> 00:34:12,664
Don't try anything stupid.

555
00:34:12,664 --> 00:34:15,967
-Sure you remember?
-l think so.

556
00:34:15,967 --> 00:34:18,002
All right.
On the count of three--

557
00:34:18,002 --> 00:34:21,062
-One...two...three.
-Don't!

558
00:34:23,975 --> 00:34:27,045
All right.

559
00:34:27,045 --> 00:34:28,979
The comedy's over.

560
00:34:41,493 --> 00:34:43,484
After them, you fools!

561
00:34:50,168 --> 00:34:51,770
Why didn't you shoot him
under the table?

562
00:34:51,770 --> 00:34:53,838
You said Marseilles.
That was East Berlin.

563
00:34:53,838 --> 00:34:55,806
Oops.

564
00:35:13,458 --> 00:35:15,960
They just closed for lunch.

565
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:18,963
Anything you care to tell me?

566
00:35:18,963 --> 00:35:21,366
The oysters look terrific.

567
00:35:21,366 --> 00:35:23,468
I mean about
what just happened here.

568
00:35:23,468 --> 00:35:26,471
I'd say it was
a domestic disturbance.

569
00:35:26,471 --> 00:35:29,474
-Domestic disturbance?
-Like ''The Honeymooners.''

570
00:35:29,474 --> 00:35:31,976
Remember how
Ralph fought with Alice?

571
00:35:31,976 --> 00:35:34,979
I don't recollect Ralph
using semiautomatic weapons.

572
00:35:34,979 --> 00:35:36,481
Norton sometimes did.

573
00:35:36,481 --> 00:35:37,982
And Mrs. Manicotti
on the second floor.

574
00:35:37,982 --> 00:35:39,484
Wow, what a temper she had.

575
00:35:39,484 --> 00:35:41,453
You got a gun?
Give it to me.

576
00:35:41,453 --> 00:35:42,954
I don't carry a gun.

577
00:35:42,954 --> 00:35:44,989
Jeff's a lousy shot.

578
00:35:44,989 --> 00:35:47,058
He bribed the examiner
at the FBI.

579
00:35:47,058 --> 00:35:49,494
That's a lie.
I bribed the guy at the CIA.

580
00:35:49,494 --> 00:35:51,996
I blackmailed
the guy at the FBI.

581
00:35:51,996 --> 00:35:53,398
You think you're smarter
than we are.

582
00:35:53,398 --> 00:35:58,169
Not much.
I just have more training.

583
00:35:58,169 --> 00:36:01,798
I thought you were
a vacuum cleaner salesman.

584
00:36:12,283 --> 00:36:14,843
What's he doing,
joining the band?

585
00:36:18,289 --> 00:36:20,959
-That's your husband.
-l know.

586
00:36:20,959 --> 00:36:23,826
-Does he play the trumpet?
-Apparently.

587
00:36:28,433 --> 00:36:30,468
I hate him.

588
00:36:30,468 --> 00:36:32,663
I really hate him.

589
00:36:43,648 --> 00:36:46,985
-Is she asleep?
-Like an angel.

590
00:36:46,985 --> 00:36:50,922
I will be having hideous
nightmares about shoot-outs.

591
00:36:50,922 --> 00:36:53,491
Don't blame me.
You picked the restaurant.

592
00:36:53,491 --> 00:36:55,994
Here's what I think.
Tomorrow morning...

593
00:36:55,994 --> 00:36:57,996
you and the pumpkin
get on a plane...

594
00:36:57,996 --> 00:37:00,431
and I'll call you
when it's over.

595
00:37:00,431 --> 00:37:01,933
Please.

596
00:37:01,933 --> 00:37:03,935
Isn't that what you want?

597
00:37:03,935 --> 00:37:07,939
We are a team.
End of story.

598
00:37:07,939 --> 00:37:12,433
God knows what would happen
to you if I wasn't around.

599
00:37:17,448 --> 00:37:18,950
I might get hurt.

600
00:37:18,950 --> 00:37:20,975
Or worse than that.

601
00:37:25,089 --> 00:37:29,253
Don't start.
I have to make a phone call.

602
00:37:31,195 --> 00:37:34,966
Who do you want to be,
good cop or bad cop?

603
00:37:34,966 --> 00:37:38,303
Bad cop.
Who are you calling?

604
00:37:38,303 --> 00:37:40,471
I never get to be the bad cop.

605
00:37:40,471 --> 00:37:42,807
You can never keep
a straight face.

606
00:37:42,807 --> 00:37:44,240
Who are you calling?

607
00:37:52,083 --> 00:37:54,986
-Yes?
-Mr. Foster?

608
00:37:54,986 --> 00:37:56,788
Who is this?

609
00:37:56,788 --> 00:37:58,990
Our organization
has been penetrated...

610
00:37:58,990 --> 00:38:04,262
by a brilliant American agent
and his beautiful wife.

611
00:38:04,262 --> 00:38:05,930
Meet me--

612
00:38:05,930 --> 00:38:08,633
At the cemetery
where we always meet.

613
00:38:08,633 --> 00:38:10,134
But of course.

614
00:38:10,134 --> 00:38:13,137
2:00 tomorrow afternoon.
Do not be late.

615
00:38:13,137 --> 00:38:15,940
So, tomorrow
we gang up on Mr. Foster.

616
00:38:15,940 --> 00:38:17,942
Do you think he'll come?

617
00:38:17,942 --> 00:38:21,446
Absolutely. If he doesn't,
we still get some sightseeing.

618
00:38:21,446 --> 00:38:24,983
So you were saying
if you weren't around...

619
00:38:24,983 --> 00:38:27,383
You might get hurt.

620
00:38:28,453 --> 00:38:30,455
Badly hurt.

621
00:38:30,455 --> 00:38:32,457
Maimed, maybe.

622
00:38:32,457 --> 00:38:34,459
Maybe...

623
00:38:34,459 --> 00:38:36,461
Maybe worse.

624
00:38:36,461 --> 00:38:40,465
Decapitated...lose my head.

625
00:38:40,465 --> 00:38:43,468
I know what decapitated means.

626
00:38:43,468 --> 00:38:44,958
Kill the light.

627
00:38:48,373 --> 00:38:50,466
I meant turn it off.

628
00:38:55,446 --> 00:38:58,182
-Honey.
-Look who's here.

629
00:38:58,182 --> 00:39:00,485
Ding, ding, ding,
went the trolley

630
00:39:00,485 --> 00:39:03,287
-Clang, sir.
-What?

631
00:39:03,287 --> 00:39:07,992
Clang went the trolley,
ding went the bell.

632
00:39:07,992 --> 00:39:10,628
So, you've been assigned
to follow us.

633
00:39:10,628 --> 00:39:12,063
Who says we're following you?

634
00:39:12,063 --> 00:39:14,666
I get it.
You have a day off...

635
00:39:14,666 --> 00:39:16,267
and you're
spending it together.

636
00:39:16,267 --> 00:39:17,969
No. Here's what
you're doing--

637
00:39:17,969 --> 00:39:19,804
pissing away
the taxpayers' money.

638
00:39:19,804 --> 00:39:21,806
That's what we're paid for.

639
00:39:21,806 --> 00:39:25,610
And following around
CIA agents in New Orleans.

640
00:39:25,610 --> 00:39:27,979
Will you get off that already?

641
00:39:27,979 --> 00:39:29,681
I say you're CIA.

642
00:39:29,681 --> 00:39:32,445
Good. Say it.

643
00:39:49,867 --> 00:39:51,969
Tell me,
what are you doing here?

644
00:39:51,969 --> 00:39:53,971
This is a cemetery.

645
00:39:53,971 --> 00:39:56,140
Are you here
on company business?

646
00:39:56,140 --> 00:39:58,476
Lieutenant, will you
get off this CIA kick?

647
00:39:58,476 --> 00:40:01,479
I'm a regular guy,
almost a regular guy.

648
00:40:01,479 --> 00:40:03,481
I got a wife, a baby.

649
00:40:03,481 --> 00:40:05,983
Enjoy yourself
and watch the funeral.

650
00:40:05,983 --> 00:40:07,719
I've seen plenty of funerals.

651
00:40:07,719 --> 00:40:10,187
I'm here to keep an eye on you.

652
00:40:14,025 --> 00:40:15,652
Lord have mercy.

653
00:40:17,261 --> 00:40:18,996
Jesus Christ!

654
00:40:18,996 --> 00:40:20,827
I guess he got here early.

655
00:40:46,524 --> 00:40:48,493
Hi. How are you?

656
00:40:48,493 --> 00:40:51,529
How was my Jonathan?
Was he any trouble?

657
00:40:51,529 --> 00:40:53,297
Oh, no. He's a good baby.

658
00:40:53,297 --> 00:40:55,199
Did you enjoy the jazz cruise?

659
00:40:55,199 --> 00:40:58,369
We missed the boat.

660
00:40:58,369 --> 00:41:00,438
Too bad.
When we did that--

661
00:41:00,438 --> 00:41:02,740
When was it, Vern?
Two years ago.

662
00:41:02,740 --> 00:41:05,743
-Three years ago.
-No, honey, it was not.

663
00:41:05,743 --> 00:41:07,545
It was right after
my haemorrhoid surgery.

664
00:41:07,545 --> 00:41:08,913
You told me about that.

665
00:41:08,913 --> 00:41:10,982
He doesn't want to hear
about your haemorrhoids.

666
00:41:10,982 --> 00:41:13,317
Come to Daddy!

667
00:41:13,317 --> 00:41:14,819
Thank you so much.

668
00:41:14,819 --> 00:41:17,488
If you ever want us
to watch Louise Jane...

669
00:41:17,488 --> 00:41:18,956
just let us know.

670
00:41:18,956 --> 00:41:20,158
Jane Louise, honey.

671
00:41:20,158 --> 00:41:22,660
No, Louise Jane.
We'd be more than happy.

672
00:41:22,660 --> 00:41:25,029
Thank you.
We'll take you up on that.

673
00:41:25,029 --> 00:41:27,520
Good night. Sleep tight.

674
00:41:30,401 --> 00:41:33,671
-You tired?
-Very.

675
00:41:33,671 --> 00:41:35,306
Oh, really?

676
00:41:35,306 --> 00:41:38,509
That's just too bad, honey.

677
00:41:38,509 --> 00:41:40,511
Because you know why?

678
00:41:40,511 --> 00:41:45,516
Because I had
some real fun in mind.

679
00:41:45,516 --> 00:41:48,508
Like what, for instance?

680
00:41:56,527 --> 00:42:00,031
Breaking and entering
into the house of a dead man...

681
00:42:00,031 --> 00:42:03,267
is not my idea
of a lot of fun.

682
00:42:03,267 --> 00:42:06,971
It would be if you didn't take
all night to open the door.

683
00:42:06,971 --> 00:42:08,806
Madam needs to be changed.

684
00:42:08,806 --> 00:42:12,176
Change her yourself.
This is a five-pin Chubb.

685
00:42:12,176 --> 00:42:14,212
See Mommy picking the big lock?

686
00:42:14,212 --> 00:42:17,982
When you're a big girl,
she'll teach you to pick locks.

687
00:42:17,982 --> 00:42:20,885
Of course, she still
may be picking this one.

688
00:42:20,885 --> 00:42:23,487
One minute even.
Pretty slick.

689
00:42:23,487 --> 00:42:25,546
Thank you.

690
00:42:26,858 --> 00:42:29,360
OK...

691
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:33,598
We can assume the cops tossed
the place pretty thoroughly.

692
00:42:33,598 --> 00:42:36,500
At least
all the obvious places.

693
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:39,503
So we'll start with
the refrigerator.

694
00:42:39,503 --> 00:42:42,006
That's funny.

695
00:42:42,006 --> 00:42:44,008
-What?
-A shoe.

696
00:42:44,008 --> 00:42:47,500
-And?
-It's got a foot in it.

697
00:42:48,946 --> 00:42:50,504
Evening.

698
00:42:51,983 --> 00:42:54,585
All right.

699
00:42:54,585 --> 00:42:56,420
You going to tell us
the whole story?

700
00:42:56,420 --> 00:42:57,788
We can tell you
part of the story.

701
00:42:57,788 --> 00:43:00,491
-Tell me all of it.
-Part or nothing.

702
00:43:00,491 --> 00:43:03,227
How about we bust your ass
for B-and-E?

703
00:43:03,227 --> 00:43:05,763
How about we talk to
your nice governor?

704
00:43:05,763 --> 00:43:09,800
All right.
Tell me part of the story.

705
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:12,937
It's hard to know
where to begin.

706
00:43:12,937 --> 00:43:15,072
My parents were
really simple folks.

707
00:43:15,072 --> 00:43:17,041
My father was a steam fitter.

708
00:43:17,041 --> 00:43:18,442
The relevant part.

709
00:43:18,442 --> 00:43:22,513
What do you know about recent
Czechoslovakian politics?

710
00:43:22,513 --> 00:43:26,050
No more Commie threat
and a bloodless revolution.

711
00:43:26,050 --> 00:43:29,186
-Very good.
-l saw it on PBS.

712
00:43:29,186 --> 00:43:31,555
File.

713
00:43:31,555 --> 00:43:33,057
Who is this?

714
00:43:33,057 --> 00:43:35,059
Paulina Novacek,
head of the Czech secret police.

715
00:43:35,059 --> 00:43:37,295
She left Prague two jumps
ahead of the firing squad.

716
00:43:37,295 --> 00:43:40,064
-She's in New Orleans?
-We think so.

717
00:43:40,064 --> 00:43:41,966
She's got men planted
in labs and factories...

718
00:43:41,966 --> 00:43:44,402
all over the south.
Industrial theft.

719
00:43:44,402 --> 00:43:46,003
Steals weapons,
chemicals, sells them.

720
00:43:46,003 --> 00:43:49,307
So you got to find her
and send her back?

721
00:43:49,307 --> 00:43:51,776
-There's no extradition.
-Has to go voluntarily.

722
00:43:51,776 --> 00:43:55,112
And you think
Foster worked for Novacek.

723
00:43:55,112 --> 00:43:57,615
He was the middleman
that funnelled stuff to her...

724
00:43:57,615 --> 00:43:59,750
and through him
we'll find the big guys.

725
00:43:59,750 --> 00:44:02,787
So we have
to find the middleman.

726
00:44:02,787 --> 00:44:05,790
There you go, Janie.
Don't squirt Daddy.

727
00:44:05,790 --> 00:44:07,058
Honey?

728
00:44:07,058 --> 00:44:09,961
Come here.

729
00:44:09,961 --> 00:44:11,429
I think I got it.

730
00:44:11,429 --> 00:44:15,132
-Come here, baby.
-Gentlemen.

731
00:44:15,132 --> 00:44:16,867
Will you give me a hand,
Lieutenant?

732
00:44:16,867 --> 00:44:19,437
Pick it up. Easy, easy.

733
00:44:19,437 --> 00:44:22,540
-Holy mackerel!
-Look at that.

734
00:44:22,540 --> 00:44:25,309
-Look at that.
-Careful.

735
00:44:25,309 --> 00:44:26,970
Allow me.

736
00:44:32,984 --> 00:44:35,486
Damn. Nothing but money.

737
00:44:35,486 --> 00:44:36,988
What's wrong with money?

738
00:44:36,988 --> 00:44:38,889
We were hoping for a name.

739
00:44:38,889 --> 00:44:40,124
Allow me.

740
00:44:40,124 --> 00:44:42,994
Come on, baby.
We'll put you to bed.

741
00:44:42,994 --> 00:44:44,562
Thank you.

742
00:44:44,562 --> 00:44:46,864
-That's interesting.
-What?

743
00:44:46,864 --> 00:44:50,768
There's a Rampart Savings
and Loan with an ATM.

744
00:44:50,768 --> 00:44:55,501
Why would Foster go across town
to use another branch?

745
00:44:59,510 --> 00:45:00,943
That is interesting.

746
00:45:02,947 --> 00:45:04,312
Come on.

747
00:45:05,316 --> 00:45:07,318
Weight on the left leg.

748
00:45:07,318 --> 00:45:09,954
Swing the right leg
from the hip.

749
00:45:09,954 --> 00:45:12,957
Come on. That's good.

750
00:45:12,957 --> 00:45:16,227
There we go.
Good. Oh, well.

751
00:45:16,227 --> 00:45:19,463
-When I was her age--
-She is right on schedule.

752
00:45:19,463 --> 00:45:21,465
I was walking at eight months.

753
00:45:21,465 --> 00:45:23,467
You walked
at a year and a half.

754
00:45:23,467 --> 00:45:25,269
Your mother was ready
to call in specialists.

755
00:45:25,269 --> 00:45:26,537
Take this.

756
00:45:26,537 --> 00:45:30,474
You think Sawyer can handle
this thing at the bank?

757
00:45:30,474 --> 00:45:32,977
Sure. He's OK.
He really is.

758
00:45:32,977 --> 00:45:34,478
Ready?

759
00:45:34,478 --> 00:45:36,810
This is
an incredible alligator.

760
00:45:39,383 --> 00:45:40,645
Ready?

761
00:45:42,486 --> 00:45:44,477
Let's try it.

762
00:45:45,990 --> 00:45:50,394
I figure the range is about
15 miles, plus or minus one.

763
00:45:50,394 --> 00:45:51,862
Think that'll do it?

764
00:45:51,862 --> 00:45:54,865
-Should be fine.
-It better be.

765
00:45:54,865 --> 00:45:56,534
That's a beautiful alligator.

766
00:45:56,534 --> 00:46:00,265
Look at that alligator go.

767
00:46:01,705 --> 00:46:04,141
I really appreciate this help,
Lieutenant.

768
00:46:04,141 --> 00:46:06,944
It's easy.
March right up to him...

769
00:46:06,944 --> 00:46:08,946
and start talking
as loud as possible.

770
00:46:08,946 --> 00:46:11,949
-Loud?
-Loud and obnoxious.

771
00:46:11,949 --> 00:46:15,853
Just act natural.

772
00:46:15,853 --> 00:46:17,955
You got to laugh
at yourself more, sir.

773
00:46:17,955 --> 00:46:20,389
-Let me help you out.
-Stop it!

774
00:46:21,892 --> 00:46:23,394
Cut it out.

775
00:46:23,394 --> 00:46:25,396
Loud.

776
00:46:25,396 --> 00:46:28,388
Loud and proud, sir.
Just you wait.

777
00:46:30,935 --> 00:46:32,937
I'd like some assistance,
please!

778
00:46:32,937 --> 00:46:34,472
We're police officers!

779
00:46:34,472 --> 00:46:36,907
Is there anyone in here
that can help me?

780
00:46:36,907 --> 00:46:38,109
Now!

781
00:46:38,109 --> 00:46:41,445
Hear what I just said?
I need some information!

782
00:46:41,445 --> 00:46:43,848
Who's in charge of
the automatic teller machine?

783
00:46:43,848 --> 00:46:45,983
I want to talk to them now!

784
00:46:45,983 --> 00:46:48,319
Excuse me.
Is there a problem?

785
00:46:48,319 --> 00:46:50,254
Can I help you in some way?

786
00:46:50,254 --> 00:46:54,725
Mr. Ferderber?
New Orleans Police Department.

787
00:46:54,725 --> 00:46:56,961
How many times
do I have to say this?

788
00:46:56,961 --> 00:46:58,462
How many times?

789
00:46:58,462 --> 00:47:02,633
Who's in charge of
the automatic teller machine?

790
00:47:02,633 --> 00:47:05,002
Must be hard of hearing.

791
00:47:05,002 --> 00:47:06,504
That's all right.
I understand.

792
00:47:06,504 --> 00:47:09,306
I can help you.
Would you come with me?

793
00:47:09,306 --> 00:47:11,342
Just have a seat
in my office here.

794
00:47:11,342 --> 00:47:13,944
I'll make sure someone
assists you immediately.

795
00:47:13,944 --> 00:47:15,546
-Thanks.
-All right?

796
00:47:15,546 --> 00:47:16,945
Better be quick, too.

797
00:47:18,115 --> 00:47:19,817
Hi, hon.
What's happening?

798
00:47:19,817 --> 00:47:23,087
I just got Louise down
for her nap.

799
00:47:23,087 --> 00:47:24,455
Scare up a white lab coat.

800
00:47:24,455 --> 00:47:28,626
Does it have to be white?
I feel very pale today.

801
00:47:28,626 --> 00:47:31,959
Just make it fast.
Got to go.

802
00:47:32,963 --> 00:47:34,465
FBI! You're under arrest!

803
00:47:34,465 --> 00:47:35,966
You have the right
to remain silent.

804
00:47:35,966 --> 00:47:37,468
If you give up that right...

805
00:47:37,468 --> 00:47:40,004
you may talk, sing, dance,
or impersonate Elvis.

806
00:47:40,004 --> 00:47:41,505
You also have
the right to an attorney.

807
00:47:41,505 --> 00:47:43,440
If you're broke and can't afford
an attorney, tough shit!

808
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:45,176
Get in the car,
you suspected felon!

809
00:47:45,176 --> 00:47:46,577
What am I being charged with?

810
00:47:46,577 --> 00:47:48,977
That's for me to know
and you to find out.

811
00:48:02,426 --> 00:48:04,195
Who's she?

812
00:48:04,195 --> 00:48:06,664
Allow me to introduce
Dr. Natasha Lottelenya...

813
00:48:06,664 --> 00:48:09,433
of the Rosa Klebb
Institute, Leningrad.

814
00:48:09,433 --> 00:48:12,436
Hello. This lunatic
has kidnapped me.

815
00:48:12,436 --> 00:48:15,806
I'm afraid Dr. Lottelenya
doesn't speak any English...

816
00:48:15,806 --> 00:48:18,375
but I'll be happy
to translate.

817
00:48:18,375 --> 00:48:20,511
What is that?

818
00:48:20,511 --> 00:48:22,446
What is that thing?
What is she doing?

819
00:48:22,446 --> 00:48:25,449
Dr. Lottelenya is one of
the world's leading experts...

820
00:48:25,449 --> 00:48:28,852
on the prevention
and control of extreme pain.

821
00:48:28,852 --> 00:48:31,889
Interestingly enough,
she's also an authority...

822
00:48:31,889 --> 00:48:33,948
on the causation
of extreme pain.

823
00:48:45,469 --> 00:48:46,971
What are you saying?

824
00:48:46,971 --> 00:48:49,373
Is she going to do something?

825
00:48:49,373 --> 00:48:50,874
That depends on you...

826
00:48:50,874 --> 00:48:53,177
on how much
you're willing to tell us.

827
00:48:53,177 --> 00:48:55,980
Oh, God.
I can't tell you anything.

828
00:48:55,980 --> 00:48:59,483
Honest, honest.
I don't know anything.

829
00:48:59,483 --> 00:49:00,918
I understand...

830
00:49:00,918 --> 00:49:04,911
and believe me,
I respect that.

831
00:49:13,597 --> 00:49:16,033
What needles?

832
00:49:16,033 --> 00:49:17,935
This is state of the art.

833
00:49:17,935 --> 00:49:22,139
In the old days, we used
Zippo lighters and rats...

834
00:49:22,139 --> 00:49:23,941
but this...

835
00:49:23,941 --> 00:49:27,945
this is called Jane's Probe.

836
00:49:27,945 --> 00:49:33,417
Now, when introduced
past the left eyeball...

837
00:49:33,417 --> 00:49:36,954
you can insert it right into
the pain centre of the brain.

838
00:49:36,954 --> 00:49:38,888
Then a little electric current--

839
00:49:40,457 --> 00:49:42,459
God, what is that? Don't!

840
00:49:42,459 --> 00:49:43,949
It's not necessary!

841
00:49:54,238 --> 00:49:55,739
Who's that?

842
00:49:55,739 --> 00:49:58,075
That's Professor Lancaster.

843
00:49:58,075 --> 00:50:01,306
He was really a tough one
when he came in here.

844
00:50:02,980 --> 00:50:04,481
Now listen to him.

845
00:50:04,481 --> 00:50:07,780
If I say anything,
how do I know you'll let me go?

846
00:50:18,862 --> 00:50:20,796
You just have to trust us.

847
00:50:31,075 --> 00:50:33,243
Tell me who you report to.

848
00:50:33,243 --> 00:50:34,978
A woman.

849
00:50:34,978 --> 00:50:36,714
A very tall woman.
I only saw her once.

850
00:50:36,714 --> 00:50:38,716
Where do I find her?

851
00:50:38,716 --> 00:50:40,517
Honest to God,
I don't know.

852
00:50:40,517 --> 00:50:43,213
Dr. Lottelenya.

853
00:50:44,221 --> 00:50:47,524
Wait.
I don't know where she is...

854
00:50:47,524 --> 00:50:49,526
but I do know
her telephone number.

855
00:50:49,526 --> 00:50:52,893
There's a piece of paper
in my shirt pocket.

856
00:51:03,974 --> 00:51:07,678
Mr. Ferderber,
I would advise you to disappear.

857
00:51:07,678 --> 00:51:10,848
Vanish. Change your name,
your job...

858
00:51:10,848 --> 00:51:14,418
and if possible, your face.

859
00:51:14,418 --> 00:51:16,887
-Who's that?
-Open up in there!

860
00:51:16,887 --> 00:51:18,889
-Come on.
-Open up!

861
00:51:18,889 --> 00:51:22,620
-Come this way.
-My name...

862
00:51:25,262 --> 00:51:28,565
Where is my goddamn car?

863
00:51:28,565 --> 00:51:30,033
Hey, Ted.

864
00:51:30,033 --> 00:51:34,663
We were getting ready
to take the kid to the zoo.

865
00:51:35,672 --> 00:51:37,174
Look at him.

866
00:51:37,174 --> 00:51:40,177
"It is believed
that as recently as 1979...

867
00:51:40,177 --> 00:51:42,579
''eight subspecies of tigers
were living.

868
00:51:42,579 --> 00:51:44,081
''Today only five remain.''

869
00:51:44,081 --> 00:51:46,583
-Oh, no.
-How about that?

870
00:51:46,583 --> 00:51:48,085
Right. Isn't he gorgeous?

871
00:51:48,085 --> 00:51:50,587
There he is.
Don't worry, baby.

872
00:51:50,587 --> 00:51:52,756
Mommy and Daddy will save him.

873
00:51:52,756 --> 00:51:54,658
Yes, we will.
We'll see to it.

874
00:51:54,658 --> 00:51:57,889
There'll be lots of tigers
when you grow up.

875
00:51:59,329 --> 00:52:01,765
Let's check out the elephants.

876
00:52:01,765 --> 00:52:03,665
Here we go.

877
00:52:09,206 --> 00:52:11,572
This is like a parade.

878
00:52:13,410 --> 00:52:15,512
You have to talk to
our little friend.

879
00:52:15,512 --> 00:52:17,080
Which one?

880
00:52:17,080 --> 00:52:20,484
The big ''M.''
I'll take care of him.

881
00:52:20,484 --> 00:52:21,746
Do it fast. I'm hungry.

882
00:52:22,986 --> 00:52:26,490
If you're in a hurry,
why don't we create a diversion?

883
00:52:26,490 --> 00:52:28,492
Like what, for instance?

884
00:52:28,492 --> 00:52:30,894
Remember what worked in Toronto?

885
00:52:30,894 --> 00:52:32,496
No. Please. Not that.

886
00:52:32,496 --> 00:52:34,898
Help!
My wife is having a fit!

887
00:52:34,898 --> 00:52:36,500
Jeff, don't do this to me!

888
00:52:36,500 --> 00:52:39,369
-Help!
-l really hate you.

889
00:52:39,369 --> 00:52:43,874
Come on. Help!

890
00:52:43,874 --> 00:52:47,867
Oh, God! Don't let her
swallow her tongue!

891
00:52:51,515 --> 00:52:54,117
Police! Police!

892
00:52:54,117 --> 00:52:56,620
Stand back.
We trained for this.

893
00:52:56,620 --> 00:52:58,952
Somebody hold my popcorn.

894
00:53:05,829 --> 00:53:09,766
And they say,
ain't you glad you're single?

895
00:53:09,766 --> 00:53:10,968
Hey, honey,
there's the alligators.

896
00:53:10,968 --> 00:53:14,471
Look at that. Wow!

897
00:53:14,471 --> 00:53:17,998
Look at those alligators.

898
00:53:20,844 --> 00:53:22,641
See them?

899
00:53:25,749 --> 00:53:28,513
They look mean, don't they?

900
00:53:43,133 --> 00:53:45,302
Morty!
How's it going, champ?

901
00:53:45,302 --> 00:53:47,871
Blue! No!
It's an alligator pit!

902
00:53:47,871 --> 00:53:49,506
Get me out of here!

903
00:53:49,506 --> 00:53:52,009
Relax.
They've been fed already.

904
00:53:52,009 --> 00:53:53,911
Stay! Stay back!

905
00:53:53,911 --> 00:53:57,414
It says here that
these are American alligators.

906
00:53:57,414 --> 00:54:00,817
Know how you can tell?
This is fascinating.

907
00:54:00,817 --> 00:54:04,955
They have a broader snout and
you can't see the fourth tooth.

908
00:54:04,955 --> 00:54:07,457
Don't leave!
Get me out of here!

909
00:54:07,457 --> 00:54:09,793
Give me your wallet.

910
00:54:09,793 --> 00:54:11,128
What?

911
00:54:11,128 --> 00:54:13,530
You owe me $57.50
for a new stroller.

912
00:54:13,530 --> 00:54:15,966
Give me your wallet.

913
00:54:15,966 --> 00:54:20,871
OK. Sure.
Just one second.

914
00:54:20,871 --> 00:54:24,568
-Come on.
-I'm coming! All right?

915
00:54:25,576 --> 00:54:29,046
-OK. OK.
-Come on.

916
00:54:29,046 --> 00:54:30,247
Hey. Whoa.

917
00:54:30,247 --> 00:54:33,150
I paid you back.
There. Even Steven.

918
00:54:33,150 --> 00:54:35,485
Just a second.

919
00:54:35,485 --> 00:54:37,654
Hurry up! Please!

920
00:54:37,654 --> 00:54:41,858
Listen,
I don't have any change.

921
00:54:41,858 --> 00:54:43,460
Can I owe you $2.50?

922
00:54:43,460 --> 00:54:46,296
OK! Just get me
the fuck out of here!

923
00:54:46,296 --> 00:54:49,566
Watch your language.

924
00:54:49,566 --> 00:54:52,035
I need something
I can use for a rope.

925
00:54:52,035 --> 00:54:54,526
A rope?

926
00:54:55,906 --> 00:54:57,207
Give me your jacket.

927
00:54:57,207 --> 00:54:59,509
Good idea.

928
00:54:59,509 --> 00:55:02,412
You're OK, Blue. Really.

929
00:55:02,412 --> 00:55:03,914
You're an OK guy.

930
00:55:03,914 --> 00:55:06,450
Please, Morty. God.

931
00:55:06,450 --> 00:55:09,044
Come on, Blue. Let's go.
Hurry up! Chop chop!

932
00:55:10,053 --> 00:55:11,655
OK.

933
00:55:11,655 --> 00:55:14,257
No, no, no.
It's not long enough.

934
00:55:14,257 --> 00:55:16,960
Tell you what...

935
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:19,129
give me your pants.

936
00:55:19,129 --> 00:55:20,687
My pants?

937
00:55:22,132 --> 00:55:24,600
No way. No.

938
00:55:26,770 --> 00:55:28,965
OK. OK. OK.

939
00:55:30,474 --> 00:55:31,941
OK!

940
00:55:33,744 --> 00:55:35,912
They sense fear.

941
00:55:35,912 --> 00:55:37,914
I know they do, Blue.
I can see that.

942
00:55:37,914 --> 00:55:41,752
I know what fear is.
You're driving me crazy.

943
00:55:41,752 --> 00:55:44,254
See the big monkey, honey?

944
00:55:44,254 --> 00:55:45,744
See the big monkey?

945
00:55:46,757 --> 00:55:49,326
I'm so sorry about everything.

946
00:55:49,326 --> 00:55:53,490
So sorry.
It just became like--

947
00:55:55,298 --> 00:55:57,095
Oh, my God.
It's eating my shoe.

948
00:55:59,002 --> 00:56:02,005
Stay back.
Give her some room.

949
00:56:02,005 --> 00:56:03,940
Put your hand in her mouth...

950
00:56:03,940 --> 00:56:06,738
or she'll swallow her tongue
like my cousin Albert!

951
00:56:08,478 --> 00:56:10,139
OK, Blue, here we go.

952
00:56:11,948 --> 00:56:13,643
Make the rope!

953
00:56:16,820 --> 00:56:18,021
OK.

954
00:56:18,021 --> 00:56:20,624
Here we go. Make the rope.

955
00:56:20,624 --> 00:56:22,926
Oh, no.
It's not going to work.

956
00:56:22,926 --> 00:56:26,463
It's just not long enough.
I'll go for help.

957
00:56:26,463 --> 00:56:29,499
Blue, please, no.
Don't leave me.

958
00:56:29,499 --> 00:56:31,501
Please don't leave me!

959
00:56:31,501 --> 00:56:33,670
Can I get you anything?
Coffee?

960
00:56:33,670 --> 00:56:36,173
I'm fine. No coffee.

961
00:56:36,173 --> 00:56:39,676
Just hurry up, please!
Bye! Thank you!

962
00:56:39,676 --> 00:56:41,178
-Ta-ta.
-Ta-ta!

963
00:56:41,178 --> 00:56:42,702
Come on, honey.

964
00:56:43,814 --> 00:56:46,983
Mary, look at the cypress.

965
00:56:46,983 --> 00:56:50,887
Hi, girls.
Afternoon, Sister.

966
00:56:50,887 --> 00:56:52,889
-Good afternoon.
-Don't miss the gators.

967
00:56:52,889 --> 00:56:56,256
Thank you. We're going
to see the gators, girls.

968
00:56:57,327 --> 00:57:00,764
Stand back, everybody.
I've got her medication.

969
00:57:00,764 --> 00:57:04,267
Here it is, darling.
It was in the car.

970
00:57:04,267 --> 00:57:07,270
Under the tongue.
Are you all right?

971
00:57:07,270 --> 00:57:09,773
Thank God.

972
00:57:09,773 --> 00:57:11,274
Thank you, Lieutenant.

973
00:57:11,274 --> 00:57:14,711
I want to thank everybody.
You've been great.

974
00:57:14,711 --> 00:57:19,148
-Thank you.
-Sweetheart, can you walk?

975
00:57:20,784 --> 00:57:22,786
I thought your performance
was excellent.

976
00:57:22,786 --> 00:57:25,222
Let's not do that anymore.

977
00:57:25,222 --> 00:57:28,291
Why not? It always works.

978
00:57:28,291 --> 00:57:30,293
I have to wash my hair again.

979
00:57:30,293 --> 00:57:33,797
Honey, it's that windblown look.
It so becomes you.

980
00:57:33,797 --> 00:57:35,799
Thank you so much.

981
00:57:35,799 --> 00:57:38,535
Come here, sweetheart.

982
00:57:38,535 --> 00:57:41,138
Want to have
some real fun tonight?

983
00:57:41,138 --> 00:57:42,639
Like last night?

984
00:57:42,639 --> 00:57:45,142
Only better.
A real fantasy.

985
00:57:45,142 --> 00:57:47,508
What'd you have in mind?

986
00:57:57,754 --> 00:57:59,779
I know you.

987
00:58:01,124 --> 00:58:04,560
Everybody know me.
I am Muerte.

988
00:58:06,363 --> 00:58:11,528
You're the guy got stomped
by that feller with the baby.

989
00:58:12,769 --> 00:58:15,237
Don't provoke me, OK?

990
00:58:19,476 --> 00:58:21,778
You want to get back at him?

991
00:58:21,778 --> 00:58:22,979
What?

992
00:58:22,979 --> 00:58:24,781
I know somebody who'd pay big.

993
00:58:24,781 --> 00:58:26,550
You don't know nada.

994
00:58:26,550 --> 00:58:30,281
OK. I don't know nada.

995
00:58:31,621 --> 00:58:37,059
But this guy said Muerte's
the guy for the job.

996
00:58:40,263 --> 00:58:42,299
Who said that?

997
00:58:42,299 --> 00:58:44,324
About Muerte.

998
00:58:47,270 --> 00:58:50,807
You got to buy me a drink first.

999
00:58:50,807 --> 00:58:52,968
What would you like?

1000
00:59:17,434 --> 00:59:20,337
I don't believe men.

1001
00:59:20,337 --> 00:59:25,242
Three guys tried
to pick me up tonight.

1002
00:59:25,242 --> 00:59:27,277
I can understand that.

1003
00:59:27,277 --> 00:59:29,279
-You can?
-Yeah.

1004
00:59:29,279 --> 00:59:31,770
My mother was right about you.

1005
00:59:33,283 --> 00:59:37,287
-Did she wake up?
-Just once around midnight.

1006
00:59:37,287 --> 00:59:39,289
Just wanted to be held.

1007
00:59:39,289 --> 00:59:41,791
How did it go?
Did Morty go for it?

1008
00:59:41,791 --> 00:59:43,793
Of course he went for it.

1009
00:59:43,793 --> 00:59:46,284
God, I am so tired.

1010
00:59:49,299 --> 00:59:51,401
Keep the makeup on.

1011
00:59:51,401 --> 00:59:55,805
-Why?
-It's kind of a turn-on.

1012
00:59:55,805 --> 00:59:59,866
Yecch! You disgust me.

1013
01:00:02,145 --> 01:00:04,347
Hello?

1014
01:00:04,347 --> 01:00:06,182
Your name is what?

1015
01:00:06,182 --> 01:00:09,152
What? Death?

1016
01:00:09,152 --> 01:00:10,813
Yeah, I see.

1017
01:00:12,255 --> 01:00:13,745
It's about Blue.

1018
01:00:16,259 --> 01:00:18,659
It's the opening gambit.

1019
01:00:22,132 --> 01:00:25,402
No, no, no.
You can't find us.

1020
01:00:25,402 --> 01:00:29,566
We'll send a man to pick you up
at Bayou St. John.

1021
01:00:49,159 --> 01:00:52,862
Come along.
We are wasting time.

1022
01:00:52,862 --> 01:00:55,298
Oh, my God.
It was horrible.

1023
01:00:55,298 --> 01:00:56,733
It was a nightmare.

1024
01:00:56,733 --> 01:00:59,235
Why'd you have
to make it so bumpy?

1025
01:00:59,235 --> 01:01:00,737
Would you prefer to walk?

1026
01:01:00,737 --> 01:01:04,240
I'm all nauseous.
I'm white as a sheet.

1027
01:01:04,240 --> 01:01:07,577
It was a nightmare.
I'm a land creature.

1028
01:01:07,577 --> 01:01:10,246
After you, sir.
Frau Novacek is waiting.

1029
01:01:10,246 --> 01:01:13,116
I'm driving back, OK?

1030
01:01:13,116 --> 01:01:17,087
It's very good of you
to pay us a visit.

1031
01:01:17,087 --> 01:01:18,588
I am Paulina Novacek.

1032
01:01:18,588 --> 01:01:20,557
Your name?

1033
01:01:20,557 --> 01:01:24,027
My name is Muerte.

1034
01:01:24,027 --> 01:01:27,097
As in Death?

1035
01:01:27,097 --> 01:01:29,998
Yes. You speak Spanish?

1036
01:01:32,902 --> 01:01:35,038
I trust you.

1037
01:01:35,038 --> 01:01:38,341
Good.
Perhaps I'll trust you.

1038
01:01:38,341 --> 01:01:39,535
Come.

1039
01:01:43,513 --> 01:01:46,277
Excuse me. Paulina?

1040
01:01:59,195 --> 01:02:00,719
Thank you so much.

1041
01:02:05,835 --> 01:02:07,337
Hi, guys.

1042
01:02:07,337 --> 01:02:09,239
You can go to a strip joint.

1043
01:02:09,239 --> 01:02:11,741
We're spending
a quiet evening at home.

1044
01:02:11,741 --> 01:02:13,743
Thanks. We appreciate that.

1045
01:02:13,743 --> 01:02:16,246
Anything we can do
to make your lives easier.

1046
01:02:16,246 --> 01:02:18,748
Isn't the baby
a little young for dolls?

1047
01:02:18,748 --> 01:02:21,751
It's for me.
It's a post-feminist doll.

1048
01:02:21,751 --> 01:02:24,554
Goes to work with little
sneakers on, but resents it.

1049
01:02:24,554 --> 01:02:27,757
-Night.
-Bye.

1050
01:02:27,757 --> 01:02:32,262
They're really
very interesting people.

1051
01:02:32,262 --> 01:02:34,389
Come on.

1052
01:02:36,132 --> 01:02:38,635
I no working with him!

1053
01:02:38,635 --> 01:02:40,770
I no working with him,
you bitch!

1054
01:02:40,770 --> 01:02:44,040
No, no!
Please! Paulina!

1055
01:02:44,040 --> 01:02:47,243
You expect me to believe
some bum approached you...

1056
01:02:47,243 --> 01:02:51,881
with information that Mr. Blue
is coming here tonight?

1057
01:02:51,881 --> 01:02:53,983
He's coming here tonight!

1058
01:02:53,983 --> 01:02:55,485
What if he's telling the truth?

1059
01:02:55,485 --> 01:02:57,487
Thank you very much.
What is your name?

1060
01:02:57,487 --> 01:02:59,456
So, Mr. Muerte--

1061
01:02:59,456 --> 01:03:02,992
Excuse me, please.
No mister. It's Muerte.

1062
01:03:02,992 --> 01:03:05,728
You come here pretending
to sell information.

1063
01:03:05,728 --> 01:03:11,462
You are so obviously
a confederate of Mr. Blue.

1064
01:03:19,375 --> 01:03:20,740
My family.

1065
01:03:22,445 --> 01:03:24,572
Do me a favor.

1066
01:03:25,748 --> 01:03:27,841
Be careful tonight,
all right?

1067
01:03:35,358 --> 01:03:37,360
-Jeff.
-Yeah?

1068
01:03:37,360 --> 01:03:40,864
I really mean that.
I got a funny feeling.

1069
01:03:40,864 --> 01:03:42,365
Maybe it's your allergies.

1070
01:03:42,365 --> 01:03:44,367
It is not my allergies.

1071
01:03:44,367 --> 01:03:47,370
Promise me you'll be
extra careful tonight.

1072
01:03:47,370 --> 01:03:48,667
I will.

1073
01:03:50,807 --> 01:03:53,877
I love you very much.

1074
01:03:53,877 --> 01:03:56,446
You really do?

1075
01:03:56,446 --> 01:03:59,382
More and more and more
every day.

1076
01:03:59,382 --> 01:04:01,384
You know what's funny?

1077
01:04:01,384 --> 01:04:02,817
What?

1078
01:04:06,356 --> 01:04:09,621
That's exactly how I feel.

1079
01:04:34,751 --> 01:04:36,343
I'm starving.

1080
01:04:39,589 --> 01:04:42,456
-Hold down the fort.
-Yes, sir.

1081
01:04:46,863 --> 01:04:49,866
He don't listen to me.
I try telling him.

1082
01:04:49,866 --> 01:04:51,367
See what I'm saying?

1083
01:04:51,367 --> 01:04:54,270
Pay no attention
to what I'm saying.

1084
01:04:54,270 --> 01:04:55,939
Taxi!

1085
01:04:55,939 --> 01:04:58,931
Shit! Damn!

1086
01:05:08,318 --> 01:05:09,785
Damn!

1087
01:05:13,690 --> 01:05:15,391
Police! Follow that cab!

1088
01:05:15,391 --> 01:05:19,229
I haven't heard anybody
say that in a long time.

1089
01:05:19,229 --> 01:05:24,531
-Come on! Just drive!
-Hold your horses.

1090
01:05:27,237 --> 01:05:28,568
Yes.

1091
01:05:31,174 --> 01:05:33,243
Yes, yes, yes.

1092
01:05:33,243 --> 01:05:36,212
Frank, I think
I'm getting the hang of this.

1093
01:05:36,212 --> 01:05:39,249
It's just like
the old plastique bomb...

1094
01:05:39,249 --> 01:05:41,308
only a zillion times
more powerful.

1095
01:05:45,888 --> 01:05:48,758
We will do our best, Frank.

1096
01:05:48,758 --> 01:05:51,661
Oh, my God. She walked!

1097
01:05:51,661 --> 01:05:54,264
Louise just walked.
I got to go.

1098
01:05:54,264 --> 01:05:56,699
Do you see what you just did?

1099
01:05:56,699 --> 01:05:58,201
You wonderful thing, you.

1100
01:05:58,201 --> 01:05:59,769
Wait a minute.
Now don't move.

1101
01:05:59,769 --> 01:06:01,304
Hold it. Oops!

1102
01:06:01,304 --> 01:06:03,473
Come here.

1103
01:06:03,473 --> 01:06:06,476
Do it again for Daddy.

1104
01:06:06,476 --> 01:06:08,478
Great!

1105
01:06:08,478 --> 01:06:09,979
You are amazing!

1106
01:06:09,979 --> 01:06:11,748
Come on.

1107
01:06:11,748 --> 01:06:13,249
Come on, honey.

1108
01:06:13,249 --> 01:06:14,617
Come over to Mom--

1109
01:06:14,617 --> 01:06:16,486
Come to Mommy.

1110
01:06:16,486 --> 01:06:19,489
Honey, you can make it.

1111
01:06:19,489 --> 01:06:20,990
Oh, baby!

1112
01:06:20,990 --> 01:06:24,727
I can't believe you.
You are amazing.

1113
01:06:24,727 --> 01:06:27,630
Come on now.
Isn't Daddy--Oh, honey.

1114
01:06:27,630 --> 01:06:30,466
Can you come to Mommy?

1115
01:06:30,466 --> 01:06:33,102
Daddy's going to be
so surprised.

1116
01:06:33,102 --> 01:06:36,435
I am so proud of you.
You are just terrific.

1117
01:06:40,209 --> 01:06:42,512
-Hi there.
-Hi.

1118
01:06:42,512 --> 01:06:45,248
-Stop here.
-l can't stop on no bridge.

1119
01:06:45,248 --> 01:06:48,751
-l don't want no ticket.
-I'm a cop.

1120
01:06:48,751 --> 01:06:51,754
You'll give me a ticket.
Entrapment.

1121
01:06:51,754 --> 01:06:55,622
Goddamn it! Stop here!
Not going to entrap you.

1122
01:06:59,962 --> 01:07:02,598
I need you to wait here.

1123
01:07:02,598 --> 01:07:05,101
I can't wait
outside the city limits.

1124
01:07:05,101 --> 01:07:08,638
-That's the law.
-Just wait here!

1125
01:07:08,638 --> 01:07:10,572
I don't think so.

1126
01:07:11,741 --> 01:07:13,174
Damn it!

1127
01:07:16,713 --> 01:07:18,348
You going to cast off for me?

1128
01:07:18,348 --> 01:07:20,616
-Sure will.
-All right.

1129
01:07:20,616 --> 01:07:23,119
How long do you think
it'll take me?

1130
01:07:23,119 --> 01:07:25,144
You'll be there by dawn.

1131
01:07:27,156 --> 01:07:29,359
-Got it?
-Got it.

1132
01:07:29,359 --> 01:07:30,690
Thanks.

1133
01:08:06,763 --> 01:08:09,766
You lost your parade.

1134
01:08:09,766 --> 01:08:12,769
Have a seat. Come on.

1135
01:08:12,769 --> 01:08:14,293
Play something else.

1136
01:08:39,328 --> 01:08:42,320
Honey. It's OK.

1137
01:09:00,183 --> 01:09:03,453
This her?
This pretty little thing?

1138
01:09:03,453 --> 01:09:05,955
She's more dangerous
than she looks...

1139
01:09:05,955 --> 01:09:07,957
but you can handle her.

1140
01:09:07,957 --> 01:09:10,960
She don't look dangerous
at all to me.

1141
01:09:10,960 --> 01:09:14,088
Come on, sugar. Come to Papa.

1142
01:09:15,832 --> 01:09:18,601
Careful, Sikes.
I don't want her hurt.

1143
01:09:18,601 --> 01:09:22,338
Sure thing. She'll be
lots more fun later on...

1144
01:09:22,338 --> 01:09:24,774
if she ain't all banged up.

1145
01:09:24,774 --> 01:09:26,776
Ain't you the clever one?

1146
01:09:26,776 --> 01:09:28,744
You bet I'm clever.

1147
01:09:28,744 --> 01:09:32,544
Wait till you see what
I got for you.

1148
01:09:36,786 --> 01:09:39,355
So far,
I'm not very impressed.

1149
01:09:39,355 --> 01:09:42,153
I'm going to get you.

1150
01:09:45,027 --> 01:09:46,255
Gotcha!

1151
01:09:47,330 --> 01:09:49,161
Damn!

1152
01:09:56,639 --> 01:09:59,164
Sikes...

1153
01:10:01,177 --> 01:10:03,168
Put it away.

1154
01:10:11,320 --> 01:10:14,357
It's a taser.

1155
01:10:14,357 --> 01:10:17,258
You're not going to give me
any more trouble, are you?

1156
01:10:42,785 --> 01:10:44,787
Having fun?

1157
01:10:44,787 --> 01:10:47,790
What in the hell
are you doing here?

1158
01:10:47,790 --> 01:10:50,793
I'm not here.
I'm at home, like you.

1159
01:10:50,793 --> 01:10:53,796
Ted, you're in way over
your head.

1160
01:10:53,796 --> 01:10:55,298
Just wait on the boat.

1161
01:10:55,298 --> 01:10:58,734
Not a chance.
And call me Lieutenant.

1162
01:10:58,734 --> 01:11:00,770
Lieutenant, believe me--

1163
01:11:00,770 --> 01:11:02,872
-No.
-Why not?

1164
01:11:02,872 --> 01:11:06,638
My orders are not to let you
out of my sight.

1165
01:11:07,977 --> 01:11:11,504
OK. Just stay close.

1166
01:11:14,150 --> 01:11:17,687
Whatever happens,
do exactly what I say...

1167
01:11:17,687 --> 01:11:19,755
no matter
how nuts it may sound.

1168
01:11:19,755 --> 01:11:21,347
Absolutely.

1169
01:11:22,558 --> 01:11:23,759
Where's your gun?

1170
01:11:23,759 --> 01:11:28,253
I don't carry a gun.
Pay attention.

1171
01:11:30,232 --> 01:11:34,396
Careful.
Things could get very sticky.

1172
01:11:37,373 --> 01:11:39,675
Good morning, Mr. Blue.

1173
01:11:39,675 --> 01:11:42,378
This is amazing.

1174
01:11:42,378 --> 01:11:45,681
I was just saying
things could get very sticky.

1175
01:11:45,681 --> 01:11:49,785
It's good to see you again.

1176
01:11:49,785 --> 01:11:52,488
You haven't changed. Have l?

1177
01:11:52,488 --> 01:11:53,990
Only your men.

1178
01:11:53,990 --> 01:11:58,728
Thank you.
It's these American accessories.

1179
01:11:58,728 --> 01:12:01,964
They're very good.

1180
01:12:01,964 --> 01:12:05,627
Come. We must have some tea.

1181
01:12:07,737 --> 01:12:11,741
You are still having
such a wonderful body, Mr. Blue.

1182
01:12:11,741 --> 01:12:13,075
Well, thank you.

1183
01:12:13,075 --> 01:12:14,744
What do you think
of the lieutenant?

1184
01:12:14,744 --> 01:12:16,412
Will you shut up?

1185
01:12:16,412 --> 01:12:20,750
You're so...
How you say the word? Foxy.

1186
01:12:20,750 --> 01:12:21,951
Shall we?

1187
01:12:21,951 --> 01:12:24,987
Also you're
a very valuable commodity.

1188
01:12:24,987 --> 01:12:27,223
Think what the Libyans
would pay...

1189
01:12:27,223 --> 01:12:29,592
for your knowledge
of American intelligence.

1190
01:12:29,592 --> 01:12:32,261
Or the Chinese.
Or the Colombians.

1191
01:12:32,261 --> 01:12:34,764
I think quite
a lot of money, Mr. Blue.

1192
01:12:34,764 --> 01:12:37,756
See?
Most people do like me.

1193
01:12:46,642 --> 01:12:48,132
Surprise.

1194
01:12:49,311 --> 01:12:51,714
I'm sorry, Jeff.

1195
01:12:51,714 --> 01:12:54,684
This is between you and me.

1196
01:12:54,684 --> 01:12:56,585
To involve Jane or my child--

1197
01:12:56,585 --> 01:13:00,589
I know. It was in
the worst possible taste.

1198
01:13:00,589 --> 01:13:03,893
You see,
in just half an hour...

1199
01:13:03,893 --> 01:13:06,228
a helicopter and
Comrade Zubic will arrive...

1200
01:13:06,228 --> 01:13:10,232
to transfer the C-22
to a cargo vessel.

1201
01:13:10,232 --> 01:13:12,835
You and I will travel with it.

1202
01:13:12,835 --> 01:13:14,837
What's C-22?

1203
01:13:14,837 --> 01:13:17,940
I was meaning
to tell you about that.

1204
01:13:17,940 --> 01:13:19,703
Bring him in.

1205
01:13:23,579 --> 01:13:27,950
So...you see, Mr. Blue?

1206
01:13:27,950 --> 01:13:32,254
I have captured
all your confederates.

1207
01:13:32,254 --> 01:13:34,724
Paulina, Paulina, Paulina...

1208
01:13:34,724 --> 01:13:36,659
my hat's off to you.

1209
01:13:36,659 --> 01:13:38,461
Why not your pants?

1210
01:13:38,461 --> 01:13:40,396
I could figure you getting me.

1211
01:13:40,396 --> 01:13:42,932
I could figure
you grabbing Jane.

1212
01:13:42,932 --> 01:13:46,368
But to get your hands on
the boss man himself...

1213
01:13:46,368 --> 01:13:47,892
the big ''M''.

1214
01:13:49,138 --> 01:13:51,774
You're saying this man
is your superior?

1215
01:13:51,774 --> 01:13:54,777
I said to him,
''Sir, the risk is too great.

1216
01:13:54,777 --> 01:13:56,712
''You stay here
in the Hollow Mountain...

1217
01:13:56,712 --> 01:13:58,714
''where it's safe,
and I shall go forth--''

1218
01:13:58,714 --> 01:14:00,216
Take his gag off.

1219
01:14:00,216 --> 01:14:03,786
No! No! No!
My name is Morty.

1220
01:14:03,786 --> 01:14:05,054
Muerte.

1221
01:14:05,054 --> 01:14:07,656
I kill you.

1222
01:14:07,656 --> 01:14:09,458
Shut up!

1223
01:14:09,458 --> 01:14:12,995
Someone find out who this man is
and then kill him.

1224
01:14:12,995 --> 01:14:14,997
I've got no time for this.

1225
01:14:14,997 --> 01:14:17,466
Mrs. Blue,
passing your child over.

1226
01:14:17,466 --> 01:14:19,058
No! Don't do it!

1227
01:14:21,337 --> 01:14:24,406
How heroic.

1228
01:14:24,406 --> 01:14:30,279
Mrs. Blue, you are of
absolutely no value to me...

1229
01:14:30,279 --> 01:14:33,282
except as an example
to your husband.

1230
01:14:33,282 --> 01:14:37,082
Jane, you know what to do.

1231
01:16:02,538 --> 01:16:05,007
Would you please hold still?

1232
01:16:05,007 --> 01:16:06,208
Those are police cuffs.

1233
01:16:06,208 --> 01:16:08,711
You can't get them off
with a bobby pin.

1234
01:16:08,711 --> 01:16:10,946
-Absolutely right.
-Thanks, hon.

1235
01:16:10,946 --> 01:16:13,949
-Want me to work on yours?
-Yeah, please.

1236
01:16:13,949 --> 01:16:15,451
Guess who walked today.

1237
01:16:15,451 --> 01:16:17,453
You're kidding?
And I missed it?

1238
01:16:17,453 --> 01:16:19,455
I'm really mad at you, too.

1239
01:16:19,455 --> 01:16:22,424
Whose idea was it to take
this job anyway?

1240
01:16:22,424 --> 01:16:25,828
We got to get out of here.
Follow me!

1241
01:16:25,828 --> 01:16:27,029
''Follow me''?

1242
01:16:27,029 --> 01:16:28,464
Give him his moment in the sun.

1243
01:16:28,464 --> 01:16:30,489
What sun?

1244
01:16:48,350 --> 01:16:51,620
Son of a bitch! Damn it!

1245
01:16:51,620 --> 01:16:52,855
How badly are you hit?

1246
01:16:52,855 --> 01:16:55,024
I'm not hit.
I just smashed my knee.

1247
01:16:55,024 --> 01:16:57,720
This is why I hate
working with amateurs.

1248
01:17:10,239 --> 01:17:11,740
Where the hell are you from?

1249
01:17:11,740 --> 01:17:13,742
North Adams, Massachusetts.
Why?

1250
01:17:13,742 --> 01:17:15,232
Just asking.

1251
01:17:19,648 --> 01:17:20,876
Damn!

1252
01:17:38,567 --> 01:17:40,057
Where is it?

1253
01:17:46,608 --> 01:17:49,111
-You wait here!
-No way.

1254
01:17:49,111 --> 01:17:52,614
Jane's an expert in martial arts
I can't pronounce.

1255
01:17:52,614 --> 01:17:55,617
She can kill you three ways
without using her hands.

1256
01:17:55,617 --> 01:17:57,050
Do what she says.

1257
01:17:59,755 --> 01:18:01,780
Maybe I'll wait here.

1258
01:18:39,294 --> 01:18:40,659
Czech-mate.

1259
01:18:44,967 --> 01:18:47,469
Daylight.

1260
01:18:47,469 --> 01:18:50,404
Zubic! Zubic!

1261
01:19:01,417 --> 01:19:03,419
Bring it over, you idiot.

1262
01:19:03,419 --> 01:19:05,546
I am surrounded by fools.

1263
01:19:06,555 --> 01:19:09,758
Climb up, Paulina! Climb up!

1264
01:19:09,758 --> 01:19:13,888
I can't!
This case is too heavy!

1265
01:19:18,801 --> 01:19:20,826
Improvise!

1266
01:19:26,375 --> 01:19:28,935
Down! We must go down!

1267
01:19:37,352 --> 01:19:40,956
Easy. Don't...let me fall.

1268
01:19:40,956 --> 01:19:43,025
Zubic, get this thing up!

1269
01:19:43,025 --> 01:19:44,526
This is good!

1270
01:19:44,526 --> 01:19:47,029
Remember!
Make it look real!

1271
01:19:47,029 --> 01:19:48,394
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1272
01:20:02,344 --> 01:20:05,211
Hey! Remember Helsinki!

1273
01:20:12,154 --> 01:20:14,281
Gotcha, lady!

1274
01:20:15,524 --> 01:20:17,059
Good wrist lock, hon.

1275
01:20:17,059 --> 01:20:18,993
Thank you.

1276
01:20:20,696 --> 01:20:22,027
Come here!

1277
01:20:23,565 --> 01:20:25,601
Come on!

1278
01:20:25,601 --> 01:20:28,092
Be careful where you shoot.

1279
01:20:32,374 --> 01:20:34,409
Mr. Blue.

1280
01:20:34,409 --> 01:20:37,742
Have you come to watch
your wife die?

1281
01:20:39,414 --> 01:20:42,651
No! Don't do that!
You'll kill us all!

1282
01:20:42,651 --> 01:20:44,419
If Jane goes, we all go.

1283
01:20:44,419 --> 01:20:47,756
Just a minute.
Think about it.

1284
01:20:47,756 --> 01:20:49,758
Don't be such a jerk, Jeff.

1285
01:20:49,758 --> 01:20:54,062
This is your chance.
Let her go and you can have...

1286
01:20:54,062 --> 01:20:56,465
You can have everything.

1287
01:20:56,465 --> 01:20:59,468
I'm getting seriously pissed.

1288
01:20:59,468 --> 01:21:01,203
No!

1289
01:21:01,203 --> 01:21:03,296
So am l!

1290
01:21:07,910 --> 01:21:11,903
We're naming the kid
Jane Louise. Period.

1291
01:21:13,515 --> 01:21:14,743
OK.

1292
01:21:17,452 --> 01:21:18,954
Dropping your weapons...

1293
01:21:18,954 --> 01:21:21,456
or you'll be
shooted from the air!

1294
01:21:21,456 --> 01:21:23,892
Zubic! Zubic!

1295
01:21:23,892 --> 01:21:26,828
Face down in the mud,
everybody.

1296
01:21:26,828 --> 01:21:29,331
Hurry, Paulina!
You're not safe!

1297
01:21:29,331 --> 01:21:33,235
-I'm coming!
-We've got to get you out!

1298
01:21:33,235 --> 01:21:36,238
Hurry, Paulina!
We've got to get you out!

1299
01:21:36,238 --> 01:21:40,175
You are not safe! Get in!

1300
01:21:40,175 --> 01:21:42,234
Thank you. Thank you.

1301
01:21:45,314 --> 01:21:47,942
We did it!

1302
01:21:49,818 --> 01:21:54,022
I had begun to think
you had forgotten me.

1303
01:21:54,022 --> 01:21:57,092
Oh, Paulina.
We have never forgotten.

1304
01:21:57,092 --> 01:21:58,559
Oh, Zubic.

1305
01:21:59,661 --> 01:22:01,263
What?

1306
01:22:01,263 --> 01:22:04,994
And thank you for flying
Air Czechoslovakia.

1307
01:22:07,369 --> 01:22:09,805
Like I said, no one
ever looks at the driver.

1308
01:22:09,805 --> 01:22:12,441
You going to tell me
the rest of the story?

1309
01:22:12,441 --> 01:22:15,444
-Sure. Where was l?
-Czech police.

1310
01:22:15,444 --> 01:22:17,746
The Czechs had permission
to come in...

1311
01:22:17,746 --> 01:22:19,548
but they couldn't
just snatch Novacek.

1312
01:22:19,548 --> 01:22:22,384
We had to create a situation
where she'd leave willingly.

1313
01:22:22,384 --> 01:22:23,919
You saw her
get in the chopper.

1314
01:22:23,919 --> 01:22:26,288
She went of
her own free will.

1315
01:22:26,288 --> 01:22:27,789
No kidnapping, no coercion.

1316
01:22:27,789 --> 01:22:29,791
You going to wake him up?

1317
01:22:29,791 --> 01:22:31,226
What for?

1318
01:22:31,226 --> 01:22:33,456
-Janie!
-There's our baby!

1319
01:22:34,863 --> 01:22:37,032
Hi, honey.

1320
01:22:37,032 --> 01:22:38,226
Hi, sweetie.

1321
01:22:42,804 --> 01:22:44,406
Thank you so much.

1322
01:22:44,406 --> 01:22:47,542
What have you two lovebirds
been up to all night?

1323
01:22:47,542 --> 01:22:51,046
There's a new mud wrestling
place on Bourbon Street.

1324
01:22:51,046 --> 01:22:53,037
Food's not bad, either.

1325
01:22:54,483 --> 01:22:56,718
You guys have so much fun.

1326
01:22:56,718 --> 01:22:58,987
We have a lot of fun, too.

1327
01:22:58,987 --> 01:23:01,123
-l could tell.
-Thank you again.

1328
01:23:01,123 --> 01:23:04,893
-I'm so jealous.
-See you later.

1329
01:23:04,893 --> 01:23:08,063
Yeah. You can go home
and clean up, Lieutenant.

1330
01:23:08,063 --> 01:23:11,066
-What?
-It's over. Finished.

1331
01:23:11,066 --> 01:23:15,237
No plans to invade Cuba while
you're in the neighbourhood?

1332
01:23:15,237 --> 01:23:17,739
No. We're shipping out today.

1333
01:23:17,739 --> 01:23:20,299
I have your word on that?

1334
01:23:45,100 --> 01:23:46,761
Please, please, please.

1335
01:24:01,550 --> 01:24:03,984
Sleeping like a baby.

1336
01:24:12,294 --> 01:24:14,663
Hi, Morty.

1337
01:24:14,663 --> 01:24:16,398
Morty?

1338
01:24:16,398 --> 01:24:21,461
OK. No more Mr. Nice Guy.

1339
01:24:26,675 --> 01:24:31,246
Blue, help me! I can't swim!

1340
01:24:31,246 --> 01:24:33,815
What do you think?

1341
01:24:33,815 --> 01:24:35,817
I'm going down!
I can't swim! Please!

1342
01:24:35,817 --> 01:24:38,353
Mr. and Mrs. Blue!
S.O.S.! Help!

1343
01:24:38,353 --> 01:24:39,888
Yeah.

1344
01:24:39,888 --> 01:24:42,958
My God! Oh, Jesus!
The ocean is so deep!

1345
01:24:42,958 --> 01:24:45,188
Catch!

1346
01:24:47,596 --> 01:24:49,097
Oh, my God!

1347
01:24:49,097 --> 01:24:52,601
Oh, God!
Thank you, Mrs. Blue!

1348
01:24:52,601 --> 01:24:55,804
You are a great woman!
The woman of the Nineties!

1349
01:24:55,804 --> 01:24:59,274
Mrs. Blue, throw me
a piece of rope, please!

1350
01:24:59,274 --> 01:25:02,544
I tell you what. Wait here.
We'll go for help.

1351
01:25:02,544 --> 01:25:04,880
No, no, no!
Don't leave me!

1352
01:25:04,880 --> 01:25:06,782
Anything you want?
Coffee, tea?

1353
01:25:06,782 --> 01:25:09,684
Coffee, tea? No, I'm fine.
Thank you very much.

1354
01:25:09,684 --> 01:25:11,653
Just get me the hell
out of here, please!

1355
01:25:11,653 --> 01:25:13,388
-Morty.
-What?

1356
01:25:13,388 --> 01:25:14,582
Ta-ta.

1357
01:25:15,724 --> 01:25:16,918
Ta-ta.

1358
01:25:20,028 --> 01:25:22,230
Now...

1359
01:25:22,230 --> 01:25:23,891
which way is Cuba?

1360
01:25:29,571 --> 01:25:33,575
No! That's the wrong way!
Please! Come back!

1361
01:25:33,575 --> 01:25:35,844
No! The land
is back there behind you!

1362
01:25:35,844 --> 01:25:38,836
Where you going? Blue, no!
