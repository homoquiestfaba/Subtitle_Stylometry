when it hasn't been
raining for a few days,

444
00:40:15,045 --> 00:40:18,463
and the two of us can get up on
that roof and see what's what.

445
00:40:18,532 --> 00:40:19,648
That way, once
the situation's been

446
00:40:19,717 --> 00:40:21,117
thoroughly and
properly assessed,

447
00:40:21,185 --> 00:40:23,986
then we can talk
about hours and materials

448
00:40:24,055 --> 00:40:26,155
and scope of work
in a manner that's

449
00:40:26,223 --> 00:40:28,557
not been pulled
directly out of our asses.

450
00:40:28,626 --> 00:40:31,677
And what I'd also like
is to agree on a deadline,

451
00:40:31,746 --> 00:40:34,180
which if not met, means revisiting
the terms of our contract

452
00:40:34,248 --> 00:40:37,399
with the probability of
penalties paid to us by you

453
00:40:37,468 --> 00:40:40,486
for each day of work exceeding
the original agreement.

454
00:40:40,555 --> 00:40:41,920
Now, if that all
sounds acceptable,

455
00:40:41,989 --> 00:40:43,256
I'll be happy to resume
this conversation

456
00:40:43,324 --> 00:40:45,858
at a later date,
but in the meantime,

457
00:40:45,926 --> 00:40:47,993
it was a pleasure
meeting you, Mr. Philips.

458
00:40:48,062 --> 00:40:51,230
And, um, my husband,
David, will show you out.

wouldn't mind.

00:42:06,656 --> 00:42:08,405

that's not a coincidence!

479

in this house.

480
00:42:39,822 --> 00:42:41,655

482
00:42:45,745 --> 00:42:47,828

your medication?

483
00:42:47,897 --> 00:42:49,897
Yes, I'm taking it.
I don't want to stay here.

484
00:42:49,966 --> 00:42:52,666
We agreed to give it a year
of our time in this house.

485
00:42:53,970 --> 00:42:56,003

how important it was

486
00:42:56,071 --> 00:42:58,238
for Lucas to have
stability right now.

at a normal life.

490
00:43:10,619 --> 00:43:12,119

gonna look back at this

491

was the right thing to do.

don't want you to do that.

and, um, a door that just
only locks from the outside.

525
00:45:19,047 --> 00:45:21,681
Um, and it really...

526
00:45:21,750 --> 00:45:24,818
It frightens me and it wasn't
on any of the plans and I...

527
00:45:24,886 --> 00:45:26,286
You know, I don't know
what to make of it.

528
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:30,974
But it's ridiculous.
Maybe.

529
00:45:32,928 --> 00:45:34,444
Maybe not.

530
00:45:36,332 --> 00:45:38,248
What do you mean?

531
00:45:38,317 --> 00:45:42,670
Dana, it sounds like you
have a disappointments room.

532
00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:47,775
A what?
A disappointments room.

533
00:45:48,727 --> 00:45:50,744
Well, what does that mean?

534
00:45:52,798 --> 00:45:55,882
There was a time,
not so long ago,

535
00:45:55,884 --> 00:45:58,718
when children who were born
with certain difficulties

536
00:45:58,871 --> 00:46:00,136
were considered
embarrassing.

537
00:46:02,775 --> 00:46:06,327
Especially if the family was well-to-do.
Prominent socially.

538
00:46:08,881 --> 00:46:10,647
Sometimes a decision
would be made

539
00:46:10,716 --> 00:46:13,584
to keep that child's
very existence a secret.

540
00:46:15,838 --> 00:46:17,187
Go on.

541
00:46:17,256 --> 00:46:20,307
So, confined to a room much
like the one you described,

542
00:46:20,376 --> 00:46:24,411
tended to only by the parents
or perhaps a trusted servant,

543
00:46:24,413 --> 00:46:29,316
that boy or girl would spend their
lives, however long those might be.

544
00:46:29,384 --> 00:46:32,453
No one to talk to.
No one to play with.

545
00:46:32,522 --> 00:46:35,589
Never feeling the sun or the
rain on their little faces.

546
00:46:36,425 --> 00:46:38,259
These children were...

547
00:46:40,463 --> 00:46:42,796
Disappointments.

548
00:46:42,798 --> 00:46:46,717
Their time on this Earth was
frequently brief, God willing.

549
00:46:46,785 --> 00:46:50,520
Then when it was over, they were buried.
Discreetly.

550
00:46:50,590 --> 00:46:53,507
Some say their spirits
could remain behind.

551
00:46:55,478 --> 00:46:57,845
So, I've been
researching the presence

552
00:46:57,913 --> 00:47:00,447
of disturbed spirits
in these old homes.

553
00:47:01,750 --> 00:47:04,684
And?
And...

554
00:47:06,355 --> 00:47:08,989
I think I've watched
Poltergeist too many times.

555
00:47:09,058 --> 00:47:12,742
(CHUCKLES) People say
I'm full of shit and whiskey.

556
00:47:38,604 --> 00:47:39,736
Hello?

557
00:47:40,956 --> 00:47:42,756
Hello yourself!

558
00:47:42,825 --> 00:47:44,091
What are you doing
up there?

559
00:47:45,478 --> 00:47:47,494
Thought you said to come
back in a few days.

560
00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:01,958
So, what are you thinking? DANA:
I think all this needs to go.

561
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:05,129
I say we demo the existing and
build a new one with pitch.

562
00:48:05,198 --> 00:48:06,596
Better drainage.

563
00:48:06,666 --> 00:48:09,299
Standard per foot?
Quarter inch.

564
00:48:09,368 --> 00:48:12,603
Fir strips, plywood, new
flashing, new tar paper.

565
00:48:12,705 --> 00:48:14,404
Top of my head, I'd say
it's a four-day job.

566
00:48:14,473 --> 00:48:16,790
I'd say a two-day job max.

567
00:48:16,859 --> 00:48:18,108
Well, I bill 80 bucks
an hour.

568
00:48:18,177 --> 00:48:19,677
Well, you'll get 60.

569
00:48:19,745 --> 00:48:23,747
So, two days,
60, 500 for materials,

570
00:48:23,815 --> 00:48:26,767
that's $1,460 max.

571
00:48:26,836 --> 00:48:28,568
You don't talk
like an architect.

572
00:48:28,637 --> 00:48:31,638
My father worked as a general
contractor for over 40 years.

573
00:48:31,706 --> 00:48:33,206
Is that right?
That's right.

574
00:48:33,275 --> 00:48:35,108
And he didn't like leaving
me with babysitters,

575
00:48:35,177 --> 00:48:36,876
so, I've spent
a lot of time on-site,

576
00:48:36,946 --> 00:48:39,579
and a lot of time
around young men like you.

577
00:48:41,450 --> 00:48:43,484
So then you're used to seeing
people smoke on the job site.

578
00:48:47,422 --> 00:48:49,289
When did you start
working for your daddy?

579
00:48:49,358 --> 00:48:52,392
DANA: When I was old enough.
Doing what?

580
00:48:52,461 --> 00:48:54,277
Whatever he'd let me do.

581
00:48:54,346 --> 00:48:55,345
He must have been proud.

582
00:48:55,981 --> 00:48:57,314
Of?

583
00:48:57,383 --> 00:49:00,667
Of you, getting a degree,
becoming an architect.

584
00:49:00,736 --> 00:49:03,603
Actually, he had
a heart attack on the job

585
00:49:03,672 --> 00:49:06,173
a few months after
I graduated, so...

586
00:49:06,241 --> 00:49:08,008
Sorry to hear
about that.

587
00:49:09,878 --> 00:49:11,544
He died getting
his hands dirty.

588
00:49:13,966 --> 00:49:15,382
Just like he wanted?

589
00:49:16,235 --> 00:49:17,684
I guess so.

590
00:49:19,855 --> 00:49:21,972

lost track of time.

699
00:58:22,564 --> 00:58:25,731
I mean, she thinks that odd
things are going on in the house.

700
00:58:27,402 --> 00:58:28,968
PSYCHIATRIST:
Odd in what way?

701
00:58:31,573 --> 00:58:35,175
She started to imagine things that
aren't really happening again.

702
00:58:41,650 --> 00:58:44,450
Catherine's birthday would
have been Sunday, right?

703
00:58:49,490 --> 00:58:50,790
Yeah.

704
00:58:54,713 --> 00:58:56,847
We both know that
you tend to bury

705
00:58:56,915 --> 00:58:58,348
your feelings for
the greater good,

706
00:58:58,416 --> 00:59:01,718
and that is not
good for you, either.

707
00:59:01,787 --> 00:59:07,390
Being out in that big house way outside
of the city is very isolating.

708
00:59:07,459 --> 00:59:11,477
Why don't you have
people over on Sunday?

709
00:59:11,546 --> 00:59:14,364
She doesn't need advice.
She needs friends.

710
00:59:19,104 --> 00:59:20,303
Okay.

711
00:59:38,290 --> 00:59:40,307
Um...

712
00:59:40,375 --> 00:59:43,142
There's a gravestone
out back.

713
00:59:43,211 --> 00:59:45,829
It's probably an old dog's,
but it scares Lucas.

714
00:59:45,897 --> 00:59:47,964
Would you dig it up
and make sure it's nothing?

715
00:59:49,550 --> 00:59:51,901
I don't want David to know.

716
00:59:54,840 --> 00:59:56,806
Yeah. Then I'll do that.

717
00:59:59,011 --> 01:00:00,810
Sure hope he
appreciates all this.

718
01:00:07,485 --> 01:00:10,486
I said I sure hope
he appreciates all this.

719
01:00:10,555 --> 01:00:12,555
I hope he appreciates all
that you're doing for him.

720
01:00:12,624 --> 01:00:14,374
What am I doing?

721
01:00:14,443 --> 01:00:17,760
Leaving the city, buying the
old house in the country,

722
01:00:17,829 --> 01:00:20,297
fixing it up so you can
throw some big dinners.

723
01:00:20,365 --> 01:00:22,865

beautiful Stickley table.

725
01:00:24,219 --> 01:00:27,586
or bought at the corner
at the farmer stand.

726
01:00:27,655 --> 01:00:29,255
Wasn't that the plan?

727
01:00:31,877 --> 01:00:33,843
Yeah, or something.

728
01:00:38,583 --> 01:00:41,684
How would your girlfriend feel
about us sharing a smoke?

729
01:00:42,587 --> 01:00:44,220
I don't have one.

730
01:00:44,373 --> 01:00:46,673
If I did, I probably wouldn't
care what she thought.

731
01:00:46,742 --> 01:00:49,476
Why not?

732
01:00:49,544 --> 01:00:52,111
I don't live my life worrying
about things I can't control.

733
01:00:53,214 --> 01:00:55,381

working out for you?

enough, you might get to see or

I was.

743
01:01:49,737 --> 01:01:53,406
Then I thought I should be home
with my wife and my son. Hmm?

744
01:01:54,726 --> 01:01:56,325
How did you get home
from the station?

745
01:01:57,362 --> 01:01:59,195
Oh, I got a cab.

746
01:01:59,264 --> 01:02:03,332
You know, I think the driver doubles up
as the town's dentist in his spare time.

747
01:02:05,620 --> 01:02:07,120

748

Yeah. Yeah, I guess it was.

Was it productive?

750
01:02:15,997 --> 01:02:18,381
Yes. It was productive.

751
01:02:20,185 --> 01:02:24,086

huh, don't you think?

752

would want to cover them up.

No. No, I'm not.

not the best idea.
