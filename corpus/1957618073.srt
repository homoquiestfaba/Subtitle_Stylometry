1
00:00:01,871 --> 00:00:05,351
(upbeat hip hop music)

2
00:00:20,744 --> 00:00:22,136
- Last summer,

3
00:00:23,268 --> 00:00:25,181
last summer was low, man.

4
00:00:25,181 --> 00:00:27,311
I mean, I can't think of no
other way to describe it,

5
00:00:27,311 --> 00:00:29,268
except it was just
straight up crazy, man.

6
00:00:29,268 --> 00:00:32,443
My mind still has
trouble comprehending

7
00:00:32,443 --> 00:00:35,966
what all went down in
like a three month period.

8
00:00:35,966 --> 00:00:36,924
- Last summer?

9
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:42,576
Last summer was an
emotional rollercoaster.

10
00:00:42,576 --> 00:00:45,491
My feelings felt like
they were on a Pogo stick.

11
00:00:45,491 --> 00:00:49,318
Up, down, up, down, up, down

12
00:00:49,318 --> 00:00:52,187
- It all started back in June
on the day my boy Scooter

13
00:00:52,187 --> 00:00:55,449
was about to begin
serving his life sentence.

14
00:00:55,449 --> 00:00:56,971
It was his wedding day.

15
00:00:56,971 --> 00:00:59,102
I don't know what it is, man
but something about weddings

16
00:00:59,102 --> 00:01:01,277
seemed to strike a chord
in my girl, Yasmine.

17
00:01:01,277 --> 00:01:05,974
- I love weddings anyway, but
Tymkia was getting married.

18
00:01:05,974 --> 00:01:09,061
I mean, that's my
girl, we are like this.

19
00:01:09,061 --> 00:01:11,149
- Dearly beloved.

20
00:01:11,149 --> 00:01:15,890
We are gathered here
today before God

21
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:21,109
to join these young blacks
together in holy matrimony.

22
00:01:23,632 --> 00:01:28,502
If there is anyone
who feels these two

23
00:01:28,502 --> 00:01:33,372
should not be joined
together may they speak now

24
00:01:34,591 --> 00:01:39,201
or forever hold their peace.

25
00:01:46,377 --> 00:01:49,507
I says, may they speak now.

26
00:01:58,118 --> 00:02:00,858
Ms. Johnson was a good woman.

27
00:02:00,858 --> 00:02:04,381
She never did nothing to nobody,

28
00:02:04,381 --> 00:02:07,252
but don't y'all feel
sorry for her Saints

29
00:02:07,252 --> 00:02:10,557
because she's with the lord now.

30
00:02:12,254 --> 00:02:14,210
Would anybody like to come
up and say a few words

31
00:02:14,210 --> 00:02:15,470
on her behalf?

32
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:17,296
- This fool's
ruining my wedding.

33
00:02:17,296 --> 00:02:18,645
- No, no, no baby.

34
00:02:21,125 --> 00:02:24,037
- Reverend, Ms. Johnson
funeral was last week.

35
00:02:24,037 --> 00:02:25,256
- Say what?

36
00:02:25,256 --> 00:02:26,518
- This is a wedding, man.

37
00:02:29,083 --> 00:02:30,778
- I know what this is boy.

38
00:02:39,042 --> 00:02:39,998
We shall proceed.

39
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:45,261
Tammy Kia.

40
00:02:45,261 --> 00:02:46,695
- That's Tymkia.

41
00:02:46,695 --> 00:02:49,740
- Whatever, do you
take this brother

42
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:52,002
to be your lawfully
wedded husband?

43
00:02:52,002 --> 00:02:57,220
For richer, for poorer,
in sickness and in health

44
00:02:57,220 --> 00:03:01,092
for as long as you
both shall live?

45
00:03:01,092 --> 00:03:02,656
- I do.

46
00:03:02,656 --> 00:03:05,440
(sobbing loudly)

47
00:03:08,485 --> 00:03:10,745
- Scoop hair Jones.

48
00:03:10,745 --> 00:03:12,095
- That's Scooter.

49
00:03:12,095 --> 00:03:15,182
- Whatever, do you
take this sister

50
00:03:15,182 --> 00:03:17,965
to be your lawfully wedded wife

51
00:03:17,965 --> 00:03:23,140
for richer, for poorer,
in sickness and in health

52
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:27,447
for long as you both
shall stay black?

53
00:03:31,056 --> 00:03:31,881
- He does.

54
00:03:33,056 --> 00:03:35,144
- It's got to come
out of his mouth.

55
00:03:42,406 --> 00:03:43,624
- I do.

56
00:03:43,624 --> 00:03:46,713
(sobbing loudly)

57
00:03:48,365 --> 00:03:52,930
- By the almighty
power vested up in me,

58
00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:57,802
I now pronounce
you man and wife.

59
00:03:57,802 --> 00:04:00,238
You may tongue your bride.

60
00:04:15,632 --> 00:04:18,547

with some hot water cornbread.

75
00:04:55,078 --> 00:04:57,295
- Do you want to make love to
me or do you want to eat me?

76
00:04:57,295 --> 00:04:58,644
- Both.

77
00:04:58,644 --> 00:05:01,080
- You got issues
and you tripping.

78
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:02,210
- That's why you love me.

79
00:05:07,255 --> 00:05:09,559
- This is so beautiful.

80
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:11,168
I wish it was us.

81
00:05:11,168 --> 00:05:12,734
- It is us, shorty.

82
00:05:12,734 --> 00:05:15,301
- I'm talking about the
reception, the ceremony,

83
00:05:15,301 --> 00:05:16,997
the whole wedding thing.

84
00:05:18,563 --> 00:05:22,564
Kwame, we've been dating
for two years now.

85
00:05:22,564 --> 00:05:23,912
Don't you think it's time

86
00:05:23,912 --> 00:05:26,694
we start making some
wedding plans of our own?

87
00:05:26,694 --> 00:05:30,043
(coughing loudly)

88
00:05:30,043 --> 00:05:33,088
- My throat feels
a little drizzy.

89
00:05:33,088 --> 00:05:35,175
I'm gonna go get a little
something something to drink.

90
00:05:35,175 --> 00:05:38,393
Want something,
champagne, wine, floatie?

91
00:05:38,393 --> 00:05:40,481
- No, I'm straight.

92
00:05:40,481 --> 00:05:41,525
- All right.

93
00:05:45,743 --> 00:05:46,787
Hey girl.

94
00:05:46,787 --> 00:05:48,267
- Hey.

95
00:05:48,267 --> 00:05:50,832
- We've been friends
for a long time,

96
00:05:50,832 --> 00:05:52,875
I need to call in a huge favor.

97
00:05:52,875 --> 00:05:54,180
- What's that?

98
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:56,921
- This whole bouquet toss thing?

99
00:05:56,921 --> 00:06:01,225
Now I'm thinking if I
break it to the left,

100
00:06:01,225 --> 00:06:03,313
you could throw
it in such a way.

101
00:06:03,313 --> 00:06:07,966
- No, the fix is not gonna
be in my bouquet toss.

102
00:06:09,575 --> 00:06:11,924
Stop acting so desperate girl.

103
00:06:11,924 --> 00:06:13,923
If you really want it
and it's meant to be

104
00:06:13,923 --> 00:06:14,838
it's gonna happen.

105
00:06:15,969 --> 00:06:17,012
Kiss kiss.

106
00:06:17,969 --> 00:06:19,275
- Don't kiss me.

107
00:06:20,882 --> 00:06:23,406
You about to get your butt
kicked on your wedding day.

108
00:06:23,406 --> 00:06:24,231

117
00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:09,984
- Damn, looks like we retire
your jersey next, playboy.

118
00:07:09,984 --> 00:07:12,288
- Hell no, man
that's superstition.

119
00:07:12,288 --> 00:07:14,375
It ain't got nothing
to do with real life.

120
00:07:14,375 --> 00:07:16,506
- Look what I got.

121
00:07:16,506 --> 00:07:17,854
- Congratulations
baby, I saw that.

122
00:07:17,854 --> 00:07:19,246
It was sort of fake

123
00:07:19,246 --> 00:07:20,552
the way it just fell
right in your hands.

124
00:07:20,552 --> 00:07:21,986
- I'm gonna put it in the house

125
00:07:21,986 --> 00:07:24,204
before one of them hood rats
tries to take it away from me.

126
00:07:24,204 --> 00:07:26,552
A couple of them were looking
at me kind of sideways

127
00:07:26,552 --> 00:07:29,032
after the bouquet happened
to land in my hands.

128
00:07:29,032 --> 00:07:32,074
- All right shorty, will
you get me a piece of that

129
00:07:32,074 --> 00:07:33,033
wedding cake while
you're in there?

130
00:07:33,033 --> 00:07:34,120
- Okay baby.

131
00:07:37,511 --> 00:07:39,774
- Yo, check this out Kwame.

132
00:07:39,774 --> 00:07:42,949
Two former members of
the Boogaloo posse.

133
00:07:42,949 --> 00:07:44,209
- Just 'cause I'm married,

134
00:07:44,209 --> 00:07:45,644
don't take my
status away from me.

135
00:07:45,644 --> 00:07:48,819
Hey, I'm a member for life
dog, a member for life.

136
00:07:48,819 --> 00:07:50,775
- Your is honorary.

137
00:07:50,775 --> 00:07:53,386
- Honorary my, look
I'm still gonna be

138
00:07:53,386 --> 00:07:54,690
hanging with the homies.

139
00:07:54,690 --> 00:07:57,213
I even pushed back my honeymoon

140
00:07:57,213 --> 00:08:00,258
so I can play in that basketball
game with y'all tomorrow.

141
00:08:00,258 --> 00:08:03,344
- I hear you talking,
but you like Lance.

142
00:08:03,344 --> 00:08:06,215
See, before today
we ain't even seen

143
00:08:06,215 --> 00:08:08,475
or heard from him in months.

144
00:08:08,475 --> 00:08:11,347
Talk to this boy Lance,
tell him, talk to him.

145
00:08:11,347 --> 00:08:14,913
(mumbling incoherently)

146
00:08:17,348 --> 00:08:18,913
- Baby, accept it man.

147
00:08:18,913 --> 00:08:21,610
Your ripping and running days,
like the million man march

148
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:23,959
and Shaft, are
black history baby.

149
00:08:23,959 --> 00:08:25,915
- Kwame you're talking
all that trash,

150
00:08:25,915 --> 00:08:29,611
but you need to do what it
takes to make Yasmine happy.

151
00:08:29,611 --> 00:08:32,483
'Cause you ain't pulling
them like you used to, bro.

152
00:08:33,875 --> 00:08:37,267
- I'm with my girl right now
because I choose to be man.

153
00:08:37,267 --> 00:08:40,225
But anytime I wanted to get
back in the game, I could.

154
00:08:40,225 --> 00:08:42,225
And would wreck
shop like I used to,

155
00:08:42,225 --> 00:08:45,007
pulling the finest
biddies on the East coast,

156
00:08:45,007 --> 00:08:48,182
West coast and the dirty south.

157
00:08:48,182 --> 00:08:50,836
My game is nationwide baby.

158
00:08:50,836 --> 00:08:52,445
- What game?

159
00:08:52,445 --> 00:08:55,618
- I think Scoot is right, Kwame.

160
00:08:55,618 --> 00:09:00,142
You know you've been with
Yasmine for a minute, player.

161
00:09:00,142 --> 00:09:01,794
See these hoochies today,

162
00:09:01,794 --> 00:09:05,752
well all they're worried
about is bills bills bills.

163
00:09:05,752 --> 00:09:08,970
Frankly your, is
broke broke broke.

164
00:09:11,058 --> 00:09:14,276
- Allow me to tell y'all about
the elephant and the mouse.

165
00:09:14,276 --> 00:09:17,060
One day they was just chilling,
walking through the jungle

166
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:18,756
and the elephant
fell in the ditch.

167
00:09:18,756 --> 00:09:21,452
So the mouse said don't even
trip man I'm gonna get you out.

168
00:09:21,452 --> 00:09:24,670
So he runs off and he comes
back with a brand spanking new

169
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:27,932
BMW, tells him to wrap his
trunk around the bumper,

170
00:09:27,932 --> 00:09:30,933
revs up the engine, takes
off and pulls him to safety.

171
00:09:30,933 --> 00:09:32,760
The elephant's grateful man.

172
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:36,717
Two weeks later, they walking
through the same jungle

173
00:09:36,717 --> 00:09:38,674
and the mouse
falls in the ditch.

174
00:09:38,674 --> 00:09:40,544
So the elephant
leans over the ditch

175
00:09:40,544 --> 00:09:44,633
and lets his hang in the
ditch, tells him to grab on.

176
00:09:44,633 --> 00:09:47,285
The mouse does and he
pulls them out to safety.

177
00:09:50,155 --> 00:09:53,111
- So the moral of
the story is what?

178
00:09:53,111 --> 00:09:58,244
- Point being, when you have
a big, you don't need no BMW.

179
00:09:58,244 --> 00:09:59,810
(all laughing)

180
00:09:59,810 --> 00:10:01,853
- I'm feeling that,
I'm feeling that.

181
00:10:03,288 --> 00:10:05,855
(upbeat music)

182
00:10:45,518 --> 00:10:47,171
- There's your cake.

183
00:10:54,868 --> 00:10:58,434
- My man you gonna
eat the rest of that?

184
00:11:04,174 --> 00:11:06,741
(laughing loudly)

185
00:11:06,741 --> 00:11:10,220
- I can pull them
like I used to.

186
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:15,396
- You're still the man you know.

187
00:11:16,438 --> 00:11:18,047
- Those look tasty,
can I get a grape?

188
00:11:22,137 --> 00:11:23,657
I'll interpret that as a no.

189
00:11:26,876 --> 00:11:29,703
Look Yas, I know me
acting really silly

190
00:11:29,703 --> 00:11:31,834
and stupid tonight
embarrassed you.

191
00:11:31,834 --> 00:11:33,269
It shouldn't have happened.

192
00:11:33,269 --> 00:11:35,052
- What was that
tack head anyway,

193
00:11:35,052 --> 00:11:36,965
are you fooling around with her?

194
00:11:36,965 --> 00:11:39,313
- No, last time I
messed with girls

195
00:11:39,313 --> 00:11:40,662
was back when MC
hammer had money

196
00:11:40,662 --> 00:11:42,968
and you know that
was a long time ago.

197
00:11:42,968 --> 00:11:44,795
- Are you sexually
attracted to her?

198
00:11:46,448 --> 00:11:49,751
Be honest with me, it's okay
if you are, it's human nature.

199
00:11:49,751 --> 00:11:52,839
It only becomes a problem
when you act on it.

200
00:11:52,839 --> 00:11:53,666
Tell the truth.

201
00:11:56,362 --> 00:11:58,929
- Well her booty is ghetto
fabulous, you know what I mean?

202
00:11:58,929 --> 00:12:01,320
Not that I be looking, but
from what I can remember,

203
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:06,364
baby could clap her louder than
most could clap their hands.

204
00:12:06,364 --> 00:12:08,626
Wait wait wait, baby
I'm playing I'm playing.

205
00:12:08,626 --> 00:12:11,019
I'm just messing with you girl.

206
00:12:11,019 --> 00:12:13,845
She is too hoochie-fied
to pique my interest

207
00:12:13,845 --> 00:12:16,064
sexually or intellectually.

208
00:12:16,064 --> 00:12:18,976
You're the only one for
me girl, I love you.

209
00:12:18,976 --> 00:12:22,151
Nobody could ever
take your place.

210
00:12:22,151 --> 00:12:23,282
So quit tripping.

211
00:12:24,282 --> 00:12:27,500
- I love you too Kwame
with all my heart

212
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:29,022
but you got to learn
to be more sensitive

213
00:12:29,022 --> 00:12:31,501
and think about my
feelings sometimes

214
00:12:31,501 --> 00:12:33,023
before you do some
of the stuff you do.

215
00:12:33,023 --> 00:12:35,807
- Okay I'll concentrate
on getting in touch

216
00:12:35,807 --> 00:12:37,286
with my feminine side.

217
00:12:37,286 --> 00:12:39,243
- I didn't say all that.

218
00:12:39,243 --> 00:12:40,591
That sounded too much like

219
00:12:40,591 --> 00:12:42,549
you going to be wearing
my panties next week.

220
00:12:42,549 --> 00:12:44,418
- Come here, kiss me.

221
00:12:53,507 --> 00:12:56,205
- Wasn't Tymkia's wedding fat?

222
00:12:56,205 --> 00:12:57,770
- It was cool, if you
like to see a brother

223
00:12:57,770 --> 00:12:59,771
walk down the aisle
to the gas chamber.

224
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:03,380
- Tymkia looked so beautiful.

225
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:06,205
And she was so happy.

226
00:13:06,205 --> 00:13:08,990
I want my wedding to
be just like that,

227
00:13:08,990 --> 00:13:10,339
but maybe in a church though.

228
00:13:11,687 --> 00:13:16,165
Kwame, when are we
going to get married?

229
00:13:16,165 --> 00:13:17,427
- 2010.

230
00:13:17,427 --> 00:13:19,862
- Stop playing
boy, I'm for reals.

231
00:13:19,862 --> 00:13:22,255
When are you going
to pop the question?

232
00:13:22,255 --> 00:13:23,864
- Well, I can pop it tonight,

233
00:13:23,864 --> 00:13:26,256
but we still ain't
getting married 'til 2010.

234
00:13:26,256 --> 00:13:29,083
That's the soonest I see
myself getting out the game.

235
00:13:29,083 --> 00:13:30,213
- Getting out of what game?

236
00:13:30,213 --> 00:13:31,822
- You know, retire.

237
00:13:31,822 --> 00:13:33,952
Hang up the jersey,
put the sneakers away.

238
00:13:35,214 --> 00:13:37,345
Metaphors baby, now
come on back to bed

239
00:13:37,345 --> 00:13:39,825
so I can enjoy the ride.

240
00:13:39,825 --> 00:13:41,651
- No Kwame.

241
00:13:41,651 --> 00:13:43,565
- Okay, then you
can enjoy the ride.

242
00:13:43,565 --> 00:13:46,740
I don't mind being
on the bottoms.

243
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:48,740
- I think it's time
we discussed this.

244
00:13:50,001 --> 00:13:52,653
- Look, can we talk about
this nonsense later?

245
00:13:52,653 --> 00:13:54,827
- That's all this is
to you, is nonsense?

246
00:13:54,827 --> 00:13:56,917
- At this moment, hell yeah.

247
00:13:56,917 --> 00:13:58,263
Now come on back to bed.

248
00:13:58,263 --> 00:14:00,309
- I think you need to raise
up and get to stepping

249
00:14:00,309 --> 00:14:02,005
'cause I'm going to
be sleeping by myself.

250
00:14:02,005 --> 00:14:04,961
- Oh hell no, you gonna get
a brother all hot and horny

251
00:14:04,961 --> 00:14:07,310
then tell him you're going
to be sleeping by yourself?

252
00:14:07,310 --> 00:14:09,832
What you trying to
do, give blue balls?

253
00:14:09,832 --> 00:14:11,267
- Handle it.

254
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:13,832
- Yas, don't front, you know
you all hot and horny too.

255
00:14:13,832 --> 00:14:16,833
Let's just get a quickie,
bang, bang, smack, smack, bang,

256
00:14:16,833 --> 00:14:19,444
go to sleep and talk
about it in the morning.

257
00:14:19,444 --> 00:14:21,227
- I'm going to be okay.

258
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:23,923
- A vibrator?

259
00:14:23,923 --> 00:14:25,706
What the hell is that for?

260
00:14:25,706 --> 00:14:27,098
- You don't know?

261
00:14:27,098 --> 00:14:29,445
And what part of step
don't you comprehend?

262
00:14:48,407 --> 00:14:51,451
(snoring softly)

263
00:15:00,801 --> 00:15:03,846
- Kwame, wake up fool.

264
00:15:03,846 --> 00:15:05,368
You were supposed to
be coming to pick me up

265
00:15:05,368 --> 00:15:07,629
so we can be at the
courts by nine o'clock.

266
00:15:07,629 --> 00:15:09,195
- What time is it?

267
00:15:09,195 --> 00:15:10,631
- 9:30.

268
00:15:10,631 --> 00:15:12,501
- Why you didn't
call and wake me up?

269
00:15:13,502 --> 00:15:14,370
- Look fool.

270
00:15:16,544 --> 00:15:17,633
- I'm gonna go hop
in the shower man.

271
00:15:17,633 --> 00:15:19,328
- Man damn that,
we ain't got time.

272
00:15:19,328 --> 00:15:22,547
Look, we gotta go right
now, we gotta be out.

273
00:15:23,765 --> 00:15:27,069
- Man this couch
whooped my, playboy.

274
00:15:27,983 --> 00:15:30,026
- Stop whining like a punk.

275
00:15:30,026 --> 00:15:31,071
You know what?

276
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:32,724
You better be glad that
she didn't make your

277
00:15:32,724 --> 00:15:35,810
sleep on the porch like a
dog, you know what I'm saying?

278
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:38,638
Hey, what'd you do anyway?

279
00:15:38,638 --> 00:15:41,683
- Man Yasmine starts squawking
about this marriage thing.

280
00:15:41,683 --> 00:15:44,291
When we're gonna get married?

281
00:15:46,858 --> 00:15:49,249
Right before we's about
to do the naked tango.

282
00:15:49,249 --> 00:15:50,945
- What?

283
00:15:50,945 --> 00:15:52,859
Yo, females be tripping
you know what I'm saying?

284
00:15:52,859 --> 00:15:54,337
After they've been to a wedding,

285
00:15:54,337 --> 00:15:57,903
especially when it's one of
their girls getting married.

286
00:15:57,903 --> 00:16:02,861
She might be nagging yo
for months, maybe years.

287
00:16:02,861 --> 00:16:04,211
- Damn that.

288
00:16:04,211 --> 00:16:06,124
I allowed her to have
a moment last night.

289
00:16:06,124 --> 00:16:09,733
She bring that again, it can
get ugly up in this camp.

290
00:16:09,733 --> 00:16:12,081
I don't want to hear
about it no more.

291
00:16:12,081 --> 00:16:15,560
We get married in 2010, 2015.

292
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:16,995
And that's that.

293
00:16:16,995 --> 00:16:18,736
- Player player.

294
00:16:18,736 --> 00:16:20,128
- I'm the King of this castle.

295
00:16:20,128 --> 00:16:21,476
- Preach on brother.

296
00:16:21,476 --> 00:16:22,866
- There's only shack bully

297
00:16:22,866 --> 00:16:24,868
wearing the pants
in this hiz-house.

298
00:16:24,868 --> 00:16:26,434
I'm running things in this crib.

299
00:16:26,434 --> 00:16:28,434
And you can quote me on that.

300
00:16:28,434 --> 00:16:29,913
- Is that right?

301
00:16:32,565 --> 00:16:35,827
- Hey baby I thought
that you had,

302
00:16:35,827 --> 00:16:37,437
had already left for church.

303
00:16:37,437 --> 00:16:40,088
Did the alarm not go off?

304
00:16:40,088 --> 00:16:42,134
I'm just, I've been meaning
to get that thing fixed.

305
00:16:42,134 --> 00:16:44,178
I got to get it,
I'm gonna fix it,

306
00:16:44,178 --> 00:16:46,394
but you want some
breakfast or something?

307
00:16:46,394 --> 00:16:48,699
I can make you something,
some cream of wheat,

308
00:16:48,699 --> 00:16:50,656
grits, spamwich.

309
00:16:50,656 --> 00:16:52,528
- I heard your
conversation, Kwame.

310
00:16:52,528 --> 00:16:54,485
- What conversation?

311
00:16:54,485 --> 00:16:56,615
- Don't punk out
now, shack bully.

312
00:16:58,745 --> 00:16:59,704
- Yeah so check it--

313
00:16:59,704 --> 00:17:01,094
- No Kwame, you check it.

314
00:17:01,094 --> 00:17:03,139
You have played me
for the last time.

315
00:17:03,139 --> 00:17:04,748
All this talk about
we getting married

316
00:17:04,748 --> 00:17:07,530
when you say we get married
is dead and stinking.

317
00:17:07,530 --> 00:17:10,575
Newsflash king of the castle.

318
00:17:10,575 --> 00:17:13,228
We get married in
30 days or else.

319
00:17:13,228 --> 00:17:14,662
- Or else what?

320
00:17:14,662 --> 00:17:17,316
- Or else you can kiss the
fattest part of my black

321
00:17:17,316 --> 00:17:19,795
'cause love won't
live here anymore.

322
00:17:28,145 --> 00:17:31,146
- Damn Kwame, you think she mad?

323
00:17:41,627 --> 00:17:43,019
- Scoot.

324
00:17:43,019 --> 00:17:45,497
Where the hell is
your homeboys man?

325
00:17:45,497 --> 00:17:48,368
- Man, they'll be here
just hold on, all right?

326
00:17:48,368 --> 00:17:50,064
- Hey, we ain't got all day.

327
00:17:50,064 --> 00:17:53,020
Either they're coming or
they're not, so what's up?

328
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:55,891
- Damn Mookie, I said
they'd be here chill.

329
00:17:59,675 --> 00:18:02,459
- What's up Scoot, baby?

330
00:18:02,459 --> 00:18:03,807
Sorry about discarding you dog.

331
00:18:03,807 --> 00:18:05,721
- In case you forgot,
I'm boarding a plane

332
00:18:05,721 --> 00:18:07,808
to Jamaica today
for my honeymoon.

333
00:18:07,808 --> 00:18:09,764
I gotta be at the airport
in a couple of hours.

334
00:18:09,764 --> 00:18:11,200
Now where the hell
have y'all been?

335
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,635
- Let's just call it
domestic discourse dog.

336
00:18:13,635 --> 00:18:15,071
But chill, don't even trip.

337
00:18:15,071 --> 00:18:16,288
This ain't gonna take long.

338
00:18:17,767 --> 00:18:18,810
- It's late.

339
00:18:24,333 --> 00:18:26,987
- I know Mookie, but
your mama was in the mood

340
00:18:26,987 --> 00:18:28,509
to barf up balls this morning

341
00:18:28,509 --> 00:18:30,727
so I had to let her
get her gobble on

342
00:18:30,727 --> 00:18:32,292
before I left the rack.

343
00:18:32,292 --> 00:18:33,858
(all laughing)

344
00:18:33,858 --> 00:18:35,597
Shall I shoot for outs?

345
00:18:35,597 --> 00:18:38,162
- Yeah Kwame shoot for outs

346
00:18:38,162 --> 00:18:41,425
'cause we bought to beat you
like you stole something.

347
00:18:41,425 --> 00:18:42,817
- Mook, I done told you.

348
00:18:42,817 --> 00:18:45,338
The only person that
beats me is your mama.

349
00:18:45,338 --> 00:18:49,340
And I wish the crusty would
stop because my, is sore.

350
00:18:58,777 --> 00:19:03,257
- You know, since you so
confident and arrogant,

351
00:19:03,257 --> 00:19:05,475
what do you say we
raise the stakes?

352
00:19:05,475 --> 00:19:06,737
- What you want to do?

353
00:19:06,737 --> 00:19:08,172
- A G.

354
00:19:08,172 --> 00:19:10,606
- Oh man, I thought you was
talking about some real money.

355
00:19:10,606 --> 00:19:15,652
What do you say we up
the ante to 2G, you game?

356
00:19:15,652 --> 00:19:17,391
- Oh, hell yeah.

357
00:19:17,391 --> 00:19:20,392
It'd be like taking
candy from a baby.

358
00:19:20,392 --> 00:19:23,306
- Not when that
baby's a bad thug.

359
00:19:23,306 --> 00:19:24,914
- Show the money.

360
00:19:24,914 --> 00:19:28,089
- Mookie, you know
we good for it.

361
00:19:31,308 --> 00:19:33,569
- No, no, no.

362
00:19:33,569 --> 00:19:36,397
We'll play for what you
got on you right now.

363
00:19:39,135 --> 00:19:40,614
- All right then, hold up.

364
00:19:43,355 --> 00:19:44,181
Scoot.

365
00:19:48,487 --> 00:19:49,269
- What?

366
00:19:50,661 --> 00:19:52,053
- I need you to flash
a couple of grand

367
00:19:52,053 --> 00:19:53,138
of your honeymoon money.

368
00:19:53,138 --> 00:19:54,922
- Kwame is you crazy?

369
00:19:54,922 --> 00:19:57,315
A couple of grand is
my honeymoon money.

370
00:19:57,315 --> 00:19:59,967
- Come on, stop
being a punk man.

371
00:19:59,967 --> 00:20:01,576
We ain't gonna lose this game.

372
00:20:01,576 --> 00:20:04,707
Look, when was the last time
we lost on the blacktop anyway?

373
00:20:04,707 --> 00:20:06,404
- It's just for show, man.

374
00:20:06,404 --> 00:20:08,664
And if by some stretch of
the imagination we lose,

375
00:20:08,664 --> 00:20:10,927
I'll go straight to the bank
and get your money back.

376
00:20:10,927 --> 00:20:14,667
And if we win, when we
win, Iggy and I get $600,

377
00:20:14,667 --> 00:20:15,493
you'll get eight.

378
00:20:18,885 --> 00:20:20,321
Come on man.

379
00:20:20,321 --> 00:20:21,539
- All right it sounds cool

380
00:20:21,539 --> 00:20:23,452
but I don't have time
to go to the bank

381
00:20:23,452 --> 00:20:24,974
in case we lose, man.

382
00:20:24,974 --> 00:20:26,497
I'm already cutting
it close as it is

383
00:20:26,497 --> 00:20:27,844
'cause y'all was late.

384
00:20:27,844 --> 00:20:29,757
- Look man I'll wire
you the duckets.

385
00:20:29,757 --> 00:20:31,019
It'll be there before you land.

386
00:20:31,019 --> 00:20:33,846
- I don't know man,
Tymkia will kick my

387
00:20:33,846 --> 00:20:35,586
if I lose this money.

388
00:20:35,586 --> 00:20:37,456
- Tymkia Tymkia Tymkia man,
what you got, one testicle?

389
00:20:37,456 --> 00:20:39,108
- I got two balls.

390
00:20:39,108 --> 00:20:41,499
- Well how big is
your balls, this big?

391
00:20:43,936 --> 00:20:46,066
- All right, damn.

392
00:20:46,066 --> 00:20:48,458
(laughing)

393
00:20:53,286 --> 00:20:56,722
- Kwame, you really got 2G's
if we lose this game right?

394
00:20:56,722 --> 00:20:57,547
- Nope.

395
00:20:59,809 --> 00:21:05,028
- That's jacked up, I'm
proud of you man, I'm proud.

396
00:21:06,071 --> 00:21:08,508
- Yo, 15 by ones.

397
00:21:08,508 --> 00:21:11,683
Winner take out,
gotta win by two.

398
00:21:11,683 --> 00:21:13,552
- I know the rules, punk.

399
00:21:13,552 --> 00:21:14,422
- Shoot for outs.

400
00:21:17,770 --> 00:21:21,857
- I'm like the spa baby, I'll
be giving you facials all day.

401
00:21:25,467 --> 00:21:28,903
(upbeat hip hop music)

402
00:21:32,862 --> 00:21:36,471
(speaking over each other)

403
00:22:28,702 --> 00:22:31,703
(whooping quietly)

404
00:23:30,501 --> 00:23:32,284
(laughing)

405
00:23:32,284 --> 00:23:37,154
- We're done with these punks,
so who's next, who's next?

406
00:23:42,026 --> 00:23:43,765
- I thought we weren't
gonna lose, man.

407
00:23:55,943 --> 00:23:57,204
- What's this?

408
00:23:57,204 --> 00:23:58,508
- That's my itinerary

409
00:23:58,508 --> 00:24:01,248
so you know which hotel
to wire the money to.

410
00:24:01,248 --> 00:24:02,596
- Scoot, baby, man.

411
00:24:02,596 --> 00:24:05,335
I sort of exaggerated
about having all the money,

412
00:24:05,335 --> 00:24:07,554
but man I'll wire
you what I got.

413
00:24:07,554 --> 00:24:08,815
- Well, how much you got?

414
00:24:08,815 --> 00:24:10,207
- Oh, I got about 15.

415
00:24:10,207 --> 00:24:12,381
- Oh what, $1,500?

416
00:24:12,381 --> 00:24:14,120
- No, $15.

417
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:16,513
- Damn you promised me we
wasn't gonna lose, man.

418
00:24:16,513 --> 00:24:18,687
- Yo man who knew we
was gonna lose man?

419
00:24:18,687 --> 00:24:20,731
We never lost before.

420
00:24:20,731 --> 00:24:25,081
- Damn, damn man, what am I
going to tell Tymkia, man?

421
00:24:25,081 --> 00:24:26,995
- Look dog, I got about
four or five labels

422
00:24:26,995 --> 00:24:28,734
looking to sign my
artist Chantal man.

423
00:24:28,734 --> 00:24:29,907
I'm feeling like I'm
going to have a deal

424
00:24:29,907 --> 00:24:30,864
by the end of this week.

425
00:24:30,864 --> 00:24:32,126
- Well, that doesn't exactly

426
00:24:32,126 --> 00:24:34,604
help me today
Kwame, now does it?

427
00:24:34,604 --> 00:24:38,084
- Yo man, yo can I
borrow some money?

428
00:24:38,084 --> 00:24:40,344
- I can't help you Scooter.

429
00:24:41,606 --> 00:24:43,172
My rent's due this week man.

430
00:24:44,998 --> 00:24:47,521
- Iggy, you're with your mama.

431
00:24:47,521 --> 00:24:51,392
- You know that she be
charging me $200 a month.

432
00:24:51,392 --> 00:24:53,783
If I don't pay, or
even if I'm a day late,

433
00:24:53,783 --> 00:24:55,436
then I'm gonna be homeless.

434
00:24:57,784 --> 00:24:58,829
- Damn.

435
00:25:00,046 --> 00:25:02,872
- Scoot, you don't want the $15?

436
00:25:04,220 --> 00:25:06,352
- Well at least tell Tymkia
that we say hi, all right?

437
00:25:06,352 --> 00:25:08,962
- [Tymika] You lost our
honeymoon money on a stupid

438
00:25:08,962 --> 00:25:11,049
basketball game with
your crusty homies?

439
00:25:12,614 --> 00:25:13,485
Oh hell no.

440
00:25:13,485 --> 00:25:14,962
- Baby please, come on.

441
00:25:16,354 --> 00:25:17,530
Baby please, no no.

442
00:25:18,878 --> 00:25:21,443
Come on now, damn baby.

443
00:25:23,878 --> 00:25:24,704

- Look, it's been
like three weeks

458
00:26:22,024 --> 00:26:24,633
since she gave you
that ultimatum player.

459
00:26:24,633 --> 00:26:27,764
- Man she just
trying to scare me,

460
00:26:27,764 --> 00:26:29,070
Yasmine ain't going nowhere.

461
00:26:30,331 --> 00:26:31,156
- I heard that.

462
00:26:40,289 --> 00:26:42,334
(laughing)

463
00:26:42,334 --> 00:26:43,334
- What the hell?

464
00:26:45,378 --> 00:26:47,334
- What is it Kwame? I
got a lot of work to do.

465
00:26:47,334 --> 00:26:49,554
- What's up with the
packed boxes at the house?

466
00:26:49,554 --> 00:26:51,640
Is our lease up, are we moving?

467
00:26:54,815 --> 00:26:57,468
- Well, since it's been 23 days

468
00:26:57,468 --> 00:26:59,861
and you haven't
reached a decision,

469
00:26:59,861 --> 00:27:02,035
I don't want to influence
it either way so

470
00:27:02,035 --> 00:27:03,253
I'm going to go away
for a little while

471
00:27:03,253 --> 00:27:04,643
and give you some space.

472
00:27:04,643 --> 00:27:06,819
- Okay okay all right Yasmine.

473
00:27:06,819 --> 00:27:10,472
This little ultimatum thing
has gone on long enough.

474
00:27:10,472 --> 00:27:11,428
What do you want?

475
00:27:11,428 --> 00:27:13,604
- What do I want?

476
00:27:13,604 --> 00:27:14,689
- Excuse me, Yasmine.

477
00:27:15,734 --> 00:27:17,040
The meeting's in 20 minutes.

478
00:27:19,647 --> 00:27:20,953
- What is this about?

479
00:27:20,953 --> 00:27:23,257
A new dinette set, a
sexy piece of lingerie,

480
00:27:23,257 --> 00:27:25,388
a shopping spree at
the swap meet, what?

481
00:27:25,388 --> 00:27:27,911
- Dinette set? Lingerie?

482
00:27:27,911 --> 00:27:31,390
Shopping spree at the swap
meet, you don't get it do you?

483
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:33,869
You're right.

484
00:27:33,869 --> 00:27:36,696
This ultimatum thing
has gone too far.

485
00:27:36,696 --> 00:27:40,001
Kwame, I don't want to be
someone's girlfriend forever.

486
00:27:40,001 --> 00:27:41,611
I want to be a bride.

487
00:27:41,611 --> 00:27:43,567
Have a family, I deserve that.

488
00:27:45,524 --> 00:27:48,352
I just don't see that
happening with us.

489
00:27:48,352 --> 00:27:50,439
- So what you saying?

490
00:27:50,439 --> 00:27:51,875
- [Coworker] Pardon me,

491
00:27:51,875 --> 00:27:54,526
the meeting's been moved
to the conference room.

492
00:27:54,526 --> 00:27:55,354
- Thank you.

493
00:27:58,223 --> 00:28:03,268
Kwame, we seem to be headed
in opposite directions.

494
00:28:03,268 --> 00:28:04,616
I think maybe it's best

495
00:28:04,616 --> 00:28:07,531
if we cut our losses
and do our own thing.

496
00:28:09,051 --> 00:28:11,835
- So what, just
like that it's over?

497
00:28:15,706 --> 00:28:16,532
Cool.

498
00:28:18,881 --> 00:28:20,273
You know, if that's
what you want

499
00:28:20,273 --> 00:28:21,925
but don't come
crawling back to me

500
00:28:21,925 --> 00:28:24,490
begging for no second chance
'cause I don't go there,

501
00:28:24,490 --> 00:28:26,753
the train don't back up.

502
00:28:26,753 --> 00:28:27,752
- I understand.

503
00:28:29,318 --> 00:28:31,362
I have a meeting to prepare
for, I'll see you later.

504
00:28:31,362 --> 00:28:32,449
- Peace you know?

505
00:28:33,492 --> 00:28:34,884
Shoot, not like you'd be out

506
00:28:34,884 --> 00:28:36,581
gang banging or
nothing like that.

507
00:28:36,581 --> 00:28:39,973
I just mean peace like
you know, be cool.

508
00:28:39,973 --> 00:28:41,322
'Cause I'm gonna be cool.

509
00:28:47,628 --> 00:28:50,845
- I truly believed
he still loved me

510
00:28:50,845 --> 00:28:54,367
and God knows I was
still cuckoo for Kwame.

511
00:28:54,367 --> 00:28:58,022
I mean he was all that and
a bucket of spicy hot wings.

512
00:28:58,022 --> 00:28:58,934
Cute,

513
00:28:58,934 --> 00:29:00,240
charming,

514
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:01,892
sexy.

515
00:29:01,892 --> 00:29:03,892
- With Yasmine gone, I can
work on my music at the house

516
00:29:03,892 --> 00:29:06,545
to all hours of the night.

517
00:29:06,545 --> 00:29:08,677
The homies could kick
it 'til the sun came up.

518
00:29:08,677 --> 00:29:11,242
That was cool for
the first few nights.

519
00:29:11,242 --> 00:29:13,373
But after that, I can't front.

520
00:29:13,373 --> 00:29:15,635
I missed the hell
out of that girl.

521
00:29:15,635 --> 00:29:20,418
Her touch, her smell, her smile.

522
00:29:20,418 --> 00:29:22,637
One night, I must've stayed
up to the crack of dawn,

523
00:29:22,637 --> 00:29:24,942
not chilling with the
homies, not making music,

524
00:29:24,942 --> 00:29:27,290
but just reminiscing.

525
00:29:27,290 --> 00:29:29,029
Looking at pictures,

526
00:29:29,029 --> 00:29:32,030
reading old letters and
listening to old songs

527
00:29:32,030 --> 00:29:33,509
that had special meaning to it.

528
00:29:33,509 --> 00:29:37,553
- When I initially made the
ultimatum, it was in anger.

529
00:29:37,553 --> 00:29:39,250
But the more I thought about it,

530
00:29:39,250 --> 00:29:41,119
the stronger I felt about it.

531
00:29:41,119 --> 00:29:43,599
I mean he had gotten
complacent in our relationship,

532
00:29:43,599 --> 00:29:44,948
took me for granted,

533
00:29:44,948 --> 00:29:47,383
putting all his time and
money into his music,

534
00:29:47,383 --> 00:29:49,383
contributed little or
nothing to the household.

535
00:29:49,383 --> 00:29:52,341
I was practically
taking care of him.

536
00:29:52,341 --> 00:29:55,167
Excuse my French but it was
time for Kwame to either

537
00:29:55,167 --> 00:29:57,863
or get off the pot 'cause
he had been constipated

538
00:29:57,863 --> 00:29:59,646
for much too long.

539
00:29:59,646 --> 00:30:01,603
- [Kwame] That's when I
decided to seek advice

540
00:30:01,603 --> 00:30:02,909
from the fellows.

541
00:30:06,822 --> 00:30:07,909
- Marriage?

542
00:30:10,344 --> 00:30:11,910
Marriage is cool, man.

543
00:30:14,041 --> 00:30:16,955
It's the best decision
I've ever made in life.

544
00:30:18,651 --> 00:30:21,130
Yo I think you ought to do it.

545
00:30:22,913 --> 00:30:24,044
It's time, it's time.

546
00:30:31,654 --> 00:30:34,003
- Oh hell no.

547
00:30:34,003 --> 00:30:35,613
Look, if you give in to this,

548
00:30:35,613 --> 00:30:37,700
she will be pimping
you with ultimatums

549
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:39,440
for the rest of your life.

550
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:40,962
Take out the trash

551
00:30:40,962 --> 00:30:43,179
or I ain't going to
give you none of this.

552
00:30:50,746 --> 00:30:52,704
- Marriage is a nightmare.

553
00:30:52,704 --> 00:30:54,095
Well, it starts off good

554
00:30:54,095 --> 00:30:56,836
but ask any married sucker after
a few months what it's like

555
00:30:56,836 --> 00:30:59,140
he'll tell you it feels like
living with the grim reaper

556
00:30:59,140 --> 00:31:01,227
and being held
hostage up in hell.

557
00:31:01,227 --> 00:31:05,143
Nags me all the time,
done ballooned up 14 sizes

558
00:31:05,143 --> 00:31:07,403
since the last time
we've been together.

559
00:31:07,403 --> 00:31:09,968
Sweats a brother 24/7 Kwame.

560
00:31:09,968 --> 00:31:12,666
Hell I'd have more
freedom up in the pen.

561
00:31:12,666 --> 00:31:14,319
- [Wife] You been out
there way too long.

562
00:31:14,319 --> 00:31:15,797
Get your butt in the house.

563
00:31:15,797 --> 00:31:19,363
(mumbling incoherently)

564
00:31:20,929 --> 00:31:23,320
- I got to go but remember this,

565
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:26,321
walking down that altar is
like walking down the plank.

566
00:31:26,321 --> 00:31:29,060
If you ain't got a gun to
your head, don't do it.

567
00:31:29,060 --> 00:31:31,758
Okay Kwame? Never get married.

568
00:31:31,758 --> 00:31:32,976
Coming, my queen.

569
00:31:36,498 --> 00:31:38,238
- My momma's collard greens

570
00:31:38,238 --> 00:31:41,107
with a ham hock in
the middle for flavor.

571
00:31:41,107 --> 00:31:43,935
Ain't nothing like
it boy, I tell you.

572
00:31:43,935 --> 00:31:46,979
- Kwame, I can't cook with you
moving around in the kitchen.

573
00:31:46,979 --> 00:31:48,239
Go over there and sit down.

574
00:31:48,239 --> 00:31:49,935
- All right all right,

575
00:31:49,935 --> 00:31:51,851
but if you need anybody
to sample something,

576
00:31:51,851 --> 00:31:55,110
say the greens or the
corn bread, I'm your man.

577
00:31:57,634 --> 00:32:00,460
Oh mama, I seen
uncle Coop today.

578
00:32:01,635 --> 00:32:03,287
What's been up?

579
00:32:03,287 --> 00:32:05,114
I heard you had a little
brush with the law last week.

580
00:32:05,114 --> 00:32:08,115
- Yeah, I spent a
few nights in jail.

581
00:32:08,115 --> 00:32:11,290
Got arrested for being a
black man on a sunny day.

582
00:32:11,290 --> 00:32:13,204
And it was sunny so
what you could do?

583
00:32:15,594 --> 00:32:17,552
So where's miss missy at?

584
00:32:17,552 --> 00:32:19,465
What's her name, Jasmine.

585
00:32:19,465 --> 00:32:20,510
- Yasmine.

586
00:32:20,510 --> 00:32:23,031
- Spasmin, Yasmine,
whatever where's she at?

587
00:32:24,206 --> 00:32:26,380
- We're not together
no more, Coop.

588
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:27,859
- You're not together no more?

589
00:32:28,729 --> 00:32:29,816
Let me guess.

590
00:32:30,990 --> 00:32:33,555
Some pigeon head gal stumbled,

591
00:32:33,555 --> 00:32:37,862
fell on your, Rasman
found out about it, no?

592
00:32:37,862 --> 00:32:41,602
Oh well she wants you to get
married and you ain't ready.

593
00:32:41,602 --> 00:32:43,341
- Yeah, how you know?

594
00:32:43,341 --> 00:32:45,689
- Oh man your uncle Coop been
in the love game a long time.

595
00:32:45,689 --> 00:32:46,734
It's written all over your face

596
00:32:46,734 --> 00:32:49,865
like stank on a bathroom wall.

597
00:32:49,865 --> 00:32:52,691
- So what you think I should do.

598
00:32:52,691 --> 00:32:54,779
- Well what you should do
is do what you want to do,

599
00:32:54,779 --> 00:32:56,780
do how you feel, see?

600
00:32:56,780 --> 00:32:58,085
Now I know for me,

601
00:32:58,085 --> 00:33:02,346
I tried that six times
and don't work for me.

602
00:33:02,346 --> 00:33:04,043
You understand what I'm saying?

603
00:33:04,043 --> 00:33:06,217
Worse than a damn job.

604
00:33:06,217 --> 00:33:09,218
Can't take a time off,
can't call in sick.

605
00:33:09,218 --> 00:33:10,566
And the worst thing is,

606
00:33:10,566 --> 00:33:12,437
it don't go over
well with the other.

607
00:33:13,655 --> 00:33:14,654
Stay single.

608
00:33:18,917 --> 00:33:20,437
Some hot sauce on it, it's good.

609
00:33:22,309 --> 00:33:24,657
- So what's going on
with you and Yasmine?

610
00:33:24,657 --> 00:33:27,092
- She gone mama, she gone.

611
00:33:29,355 --> 00:33:32,441
- It's all right baby, tell
mama why, what happened?

612
00:33:32,441 --> 00:33:33,833
- She said some junk

613
00:33:33,833 --> 00:33:35,703
about being tired of
being a bridesmaid.

614
00:33:35,703 --> 00:33:37,746
So marry me or else.

615
00:33:37,746 --> 00:33:40,661
- Well see that's
not junk to her,

616
00:33:40,661 --> 00:33:42,921
just like your music
is not junk to you,

617
00:33:42,921 --> 00:33:45,705
you got to respect her feelings.

618
00:33:45,705 --> 00:33:47,663
I love you boy, but
I'm not mad at the girl

619
00:33:47,663 --> 00:33:48,838
for looking out for her future.

620
00:33:48,838 --> 00:33:50,316
- I am,

621
00:33:50,316 --> 00:33:53,403
I mean, I was her future.

622
00:33:54,881 --> 00:33:56,491
- The older you get
the harder it is

623
00:33:56,491 --> 00:33:59,231
to find that special somebody.

624
00:33:59,231 --> 00:34:00,798
I haven't found anybody

625
00:34:00,798 --> 00:34:03,275
since your father and I
fell out 20 years ago.

626
00:34:04,841 --> 00:34:09,015
Well let's just say she waits
three, five years for you.

627
00:34:09,015 --> 00:34:11,843
And then you don't marry her.

628
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:16,627
I'm not saying for
you to be pressured

629
00:34:16,627 --> 00:34:19,453
into doing anything
you don't want to do,

630
00:34:19,453 --> 00:34:22,237
but this is a defining
moment in your life.

631
00:34:23,629 --> 00:34:27,325
And it may end up being
defined in two parts.

632
00:34:28,544 --> 00:34:30,848
Before the ultimatum
and after the ultimatum.

633
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:32,979
So you be sure

634
00:34:34,675 --> 00:34:37,546
that you can live with the
consequences of your decision.

635
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:44,808
- Damn pimping.

636
00:34:44,808 --> 00:34:47,287
I can't believe you got me
waiting outside of a booty club

637
00:34:47,287 --> 00:34:49,243
to go on a blind
date with a stripper.

638
00:34:50,723 --> 00:34:51,810
Don't it bother you dude

639
00:34:51,810 --> 00:34:53,549
that Cassandra is a
hairdresser by day

640
00:34:53,549 --> 00:34:54,941
and a stripper by night?

641
00:34:56,768 --> 00:34:57,594
- No.

642
00:34:59,943 --> 00:35:03,379
- Kind of feel guilty dog,
like I shouldn't be doing this.

643
00:35:04,813 --> 00:35:06,422
- What?

644
00:35:06,422 --> 00:35:09,119
She quit yo man.

645
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:11,858
Look, we just out here
trying to have a good time

646
00:35:11,858 --> 00:35:13,903
trying to take your
mind off of that.

647
00:35:14,989 --> 00:35:17,469
It's just a date player.

648
00:35:17,469 --> 00:35:18,991
- Yeah yeah yeah yeah you right.

649
00:35:18,991 --> 00:35:20,513
What'd you say she
looked like again?

650
00:35:20,513 --> 00:35:22,078
- I don't really know.

651
00:35:22,078 --> 00:35:24,341
- I thought you
said she was fine.

652
00:35:24,341 --> 00:35:26,298
- I said that's what I heard.

653
00:35:26,298 --> 00:35:28,776
I also heard that, you
know, the brothers,

654
00:35:28,776 --> 00:35:31,212
well they really just be
like dating her one time

655
00:35:31,212 --> 00:35:32,952
because of the problem
that she used to have.

656
00:35:32,952 --> 00:35:34,212
But it's cool.

657
00:35:34,212 --> 00:35:35,690
- What you talking
about, man what problem?

658
00:35:35,690 --> 00:35:37,300
- Here she comes.

659
00:35:49,086 --> 00:35:52,305
- All right, let's go.

660
00:35:52,305 --> 00:35:53,174
Let's go.

661
00:35:54,479 --> 00:35:56,435
- Girl you are
wearing my carpet out

662
00:35:56,435 --> 00:35:59,480
with all that pacing back
and forth, look at you.

663
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:01,393
- Please, them six
crumb snatchers

664
00:36:01,393 --> 00:36:04,699
you got running around here
wore this carpet out years ago.

665
00:36:04,699 --> 00:36:07,657
- I miss Kwame and I
feel guilty as hell

666
00:36:07,657 --> 00:36:09,090
like I shouldn't be doing this.

667
00:36:09,090 --> 00:36:11,309
- Look, what you
need to do is go out

668
00:36:11,309 --> 00:36:14,179
and have yourself
some fun for real.

669
00:36:14,179 --> 00:36:16,136
And maybe you and little Junebug

670
00:36:16,136 --> 00:36:19,311
might develop a booty
job for each other.

671
00:36:19,311 --> 00:36:20,790
- Little Junebug?

672
00:36:20,790 --> 00:36:21,617
- Yeah.

673
00:36:21,617 --> 00:36:22,703
- How little is he?

674
00:36:23,965 --> 00:36:26,966
(doorbell ringing)

675
00:36:29,183 --> 00:36:30,532
- What's up cous?

676
00:36:31,879 --> 00:36:34,837
- Which one of you high
class hoochies is Yasmine?

677
00:36:46,188 --> 00:36:47,754
- So what do you like to do?

678
00:36:49,798 --> 00:36:52,973
(farting quietly)

679
00:36:56,930 --> 00:36:57,842
You like to dance?

680
00:36:59,060 --> 00:37:00,235
I like to dance.

681
00:37:02,105 --> 00:37:03,454
I like to go out to the club.

682
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:08,366
(farting louder)

683
00:37:14,717 --> 00:37:18,196
And then afterwards, I want
to get something to eat?

684
00:37:18,196 --> 00:37:20,240
So I think I'm
getting hungry now.

685
00:37:22,807 --> 00:37:25,589
Maybe some breakfast
food or something.

686
00:37:25,589 --> 00:37:29,025
Maybe like some
pancakes, some eggs.

687
00:37:29,025 --> 00:37:31,809
(farting loudly)

688
00:37:37,940 --> 00:37:39,506
- I wanna get an
advertisement secretary job

689
00:37:39,506 --> 00:37:41,855
so I can get my shop
on like that girl.

690
00:37:41,855 --> 00:37:44,986
You've got a week's wardrobe
in them bags and look.

691
00:37:44,986 --> 00:37:47,160
I got a damn sock.

692
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:48,333
- Where's the other one?

693
00:37:48,333 --> 00:37:49,683
- I couldn't afford it.

694
00:37:49,683 --> 00:37:52,553
- Girl please, I shop
when I'm depressed.

695
00:37:52,553 --> 00:37:54,814
You better lucky you have a BMW.

696
00:37:54,814 --> 00:37:55,642
- What?

697
00:37:55,642 --> 00:37:57,251
- Black man working.

698
00:37:57,251 --> 00:37:59,816
You're not waiting to exhale
like some of us, okay?

699
00:38:02,294 --> 00:38:03,208
Is that Lance?

700
00:38:05,861 --> 00:38:07,339
- They are so trifling.

701
00:38:08,644 --> 00:38:11,385
Anyway, don't keep me
in suspense, tell me.

702
00:38:11,385 --> 00:38:13,776
How was your date with tattoo?

703
00:38:17,081 --> 00:38:18,734
- He spent half
the night talking

704
00:38:18,734 --> 00:38:21,473
and the other half trying
to get in my panties.

705
00:38:21,473 --> 00:38:25,562
Yo yo baby, back that up so
little Junebug can whack.

706
00:38:27,127 --> 00:38:28,084
- He got any money girl?

707
00:38:28,084 --> 00:38:29,519
- Hell no, I had to put in $2

708
00:38:29,519 --> 00:38:32,390
so I could supersize
my kid's meal.

709
00:38:32,390 --> 00:38:34,478
- What, why you
get a kid's meal?

710
00:38:34,478 --> 00:38:36,261
- Because when we were at
the drive through window,

711
00:38:36,261 --> 00:38:39,392
he made it clear that if I
ordered anything over $5,

712
00:38:39,392 --> 00:38:41,045
I will have to give
him some booty.

713
00:38:41,045 --> 00:38:43,523
I was hungry, but
not that hungry.

714
00:38:43,523 --> 00:38:44,611
- I know that girl.

715
00:38:49,916 --> 00:38:53,309
- Hold up Yasmine, hold up
I just want to rap to you.

716
00:38:53,309 --> 00:38:54,177
Two minutes.

717
00:38:55,092 --> 00:38:57,136
- You got one minute.

718
00:38:57,136 --> 00:38:59,179
- Well, I guess I better
get right to the point

719
00:38:59,179 --> 00:39:00,919
since you cut my time all short.

720
00:39:02,267 --> 00:39:03,703
I want you back Yasmine.

721
00:39:04,919 --> 00:39:08,181
Baby what we had was special.

722
00:39:08,181 --> 00:39:12,487
I want us to recapture that
and rekindle that magic.

723
00:39:12,487 --> 00:39:14,445
If you would just give
me another chance.

724
00:39:14,445 --> 00:39:15,837
- Why?

725
00:39:15,837 --> 00:39:17,489
So you can cheat on me again
with another white girl?

726
00:39:17,489 --> 00:39:20,271
- Baby that was a long time ago.

727
00:39:20,271 --> 00:39:22,708
I've matured since then.

728
00:39:22,708 --> 00:39:24,143
I'm a one woman, man.

729
00:39:24,143 --> 00:39:25,534
- I don't know Mookie.

730
00:39:25,534 --> 00:39:29,666
My mama always told me if
barks like a dog, it's a dog.

731
00:39:29,666 --> 00:39:31,710
- You leaving me, that
was the best thing

732
00:39:31,710 --> 00:39:33,406
that ever happened to me.

733
00:39:33,406 --> 00:39:36,754
It forced me to grow up
and be a man about myself.

734
00:39:36,754 --> 00:39:39,973
- I'm glad something positive
came out of my broken heart.

735
00:39:39,973 --> 00:39:42,278
- I want the same thing Yasmine.

736
00:39:42,278 --> 00:39:46,148
To settle down and
raise a family.

737
00:39:46,148 --> 00:39:48,497
Now I've got the dollars.

738
00:39:48,497 --> 00:39:50,455
I've got the clothes.

739
00:39:50,455 --> 00:39:54,412
I've got the car and
I've got the house.

740
00:39:54,412 --> 00:39:57,717
The only thing that's
missing is you, Yasmine.

741
00:39:59,673 --> 00:40:01,804
- I don't think so Mookie.

742
00:40:01,804 --> 00:40:02,718
- It's Kwame huh?

743
00:40:04,109 --> 00:40:06,893
You are going to waste your
whole life waiting for Kwame

744
00:40:06,893 --> 00:40:09,153
because he is not
going to marry you.

745
00:40:10,415 --> 00:40:12,852
His mentality is,
why pay for the cow

746
00:40:12,852 --> 00:40:15,199
when I can get
the milk for free.

747
00:40:15,199 --> 00:40:17,417
I don't know why you want to
marry that brother anyway,

748
00:40:17,417 --> 00:40:19,113
the brother is a scrub.

749
00:40:19,113 --> 00:40:20,462
If you didn't pay his bills,

750
00:40:20,462 --> 00:40:22,375
he'd be at home
living with his mom.

751
00:40:22,375 --> 00:40:23,723
That's appealing to you?

752
00:40:23,723 --> 00:40:24,854
- One minute is up.

753
00:40:27,941 --> 00:40:29,551
- Well you know the number boo,

754
00:40:29,551 --> 00:40:33,160
when you want the
company of a real man.

755
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:35,466
- Yas, does Mookie
still have that Porsche?

756
00:40:38,031 --> 00:40:39,423
What's that?

757
00:40:39,423 --> 00:40:42,555
He drives a Porsche
and he's romantic?

758
00:40:42,555 --> 00:40:44,686
Mookie kind of got it going on.

759
00:40:44,686 --> 00:40:45,990
You might want to reconsider

760
00:40:45,990 --> 00:40:47,731
giving that brother
another chance.

761
00:40:49,034 --> 00:40:50,817
- This isn't from Mookie.

762
00:40:59,951 --> 00:41:01,951
- Look who it is madam.

763
00:41:03,690 --> 00:41:07,083
- Hi, it's good to see you.

764
00:41:07,083 --> 00:41:11,431
- It's good to see you
too, you look beautiful.

765
00:41:11,431 --> 00:41:14,519
- Thank you, you look
very handsome yourself.

766
00:41:14,519 --> 00:41:16,302
- It's just a little
something I picked up

767
00:41:16,302 --> 00:41:17,390
back at the dumpster.

768
00:41:27,479 --> 00:41:30,827
- So what is it you brought
me here to talk about

769
00:41:30,827 --> 00:41:34,046
that requires me to
dress to impress?

770
00:41:34,046 --> 00:41:36,656
- Well, I just thought
we'd have a little dinner.

771
00:41:36,656 --> 00:41:38,830
Discuss important issues.

772
00:41:38,830 --> 00:41:43,657
Inflation, why gangsters
don't dance, they boogy, us.

773
00:41:43,657 --> 00:41:45,137
- I would like that.

774
00:41:49,528 --> 00:41:50,877
- That's not all.

775
00:41:53,748 --> 00:41:54,573
Mac and chizzies.

776
00:41:55,835 --> 00:41:56,878
- You made me mac
and cheese boy?

777
00:41:56,878 --> 00:41:58,704
You know that's my favorite.

778
00:42:00,356 --> 00:42:01,662
I know you're trying
to break a sister off

779
00:42:01,662 --> 00:42:02,967
with more than that,

780
00:42:02,967 --> 00:42:04,140
that ain't even gonna
take the edge off.

781
00:42:04,140 --> 00:42:07,488
- My bad my bad my bad, dang.

782
00:42:07,488 --> 00:42:09,839
(moaning)

783
00:42:09,839 --> 00:42:11,273
- Damn baby, slow down.

784
00:42:11,273 --> 00:42:13,839
Ain't nobody going to take
it from you, I promise.

785
00:42:14,753 --> 00:42:16,013
- What's that?

786
00:42:16,013 --> 00:42:17,448
- What?

787
00:42:17,448 --> 00:42:18,275
- That.

788
00:42:24,841 --> 00:42:25,842
Oh how cute.

789
00:42:33,322 --> 00:42:36,193
- Yas, you are the
most beautifulest

790
00:42:36,193 --> 00:42:39,064
and intelligent woman I know.

791
00:42:39,064 --> 00:42:43,021
You mean the world to me and
I don't ever want to lose you.

792
00:42:43,021 --> 00:42:46,326
I will never ever meet
another woman like you.

793
00:42:46,326 --> 00:42:49,196
You are the woman of my dreams.

794
00:42:49,196 --> 00:42:54,415
Yasmine Denise Brooks, I
want you to be my wife.

795
00:42:55,111 --> 00:42:56,590
Will you marry me?

796
00:42:56,590 --> 00:42:57,459
- Yes Kwame,

797
00:42:58,591 --> 00:42:59,415
yes.

798
00:43:05,592 --> 00:43:09,462
Hold up, exactly what decade
are you talking about?

799
00:43:09,462 --> 00:43:11,724

of all people is
going out like this.

818
00:44:17,871 --> 00:44:19,740
- I'm getting out the game dog.

819
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:21,873
Ain't nothing in them
streets, but trouble.

820
00:44:21,873 --> 00:44:24,742
Three weeks from now,
I'll be a married man.

821
00:44:24,742 --> 00:44:26,134
- All right player look,

822
00:44:26,134 --> 00:44:29,570
before you make that drastic
move into everlasting lockdown,

823
00:44:29,570 --> 00:44:33,571
you need to let me hook
you up with my friend Liza.

824
00:44:33,571 --> 00:44:36,137
- Big booty Liza
from 112th street?

825
00:44:36,137 --> 00:44:38,399
- Hell yeah, y'all
make a good couple.

826
00:44:38,399 --> 00:44:41,356
- Man that broad is a hoe.

827
00:44:41,356 --> 00:44:42,922
- No pimping.

828
00:44:42,922 --> 00:44:47,531
- Dude, if she had as many
on her as she had in her,

829
00:44:47,531 --> 00:44:49,880
she'd look like
a damn porcupine.

830
00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:52,880
- Why do you think she
won't give me nothing?

831
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:55,273
(laughing)

832
00:45:05,710 --> 00:45:10,015
- Well well well, if it
isn't the non ball playing,

833
00:45:10,015 --> 00:45:13,844
no game having, can't
shoot brother named Kwame.

834
00:45:13,844 --> 00:45:16,104
- Mook, I'm not tripping
off one loss, man.

835
00:45:16,104 --> 00:45:18,583
Everybody loses once or twice.

836
00:45:18,583 --> 00:45:19,714
- Really?

837
00:45:19,714 --> 00:45:21,106
I don't.

838
00:45:21,106 --> 00:45:23,150
- Just be talking
about basketball.

839
00:45:23,150 --> 00:45:25,978
'Cause if I can remember
right, about two years ago,

840
00:45:25,978 --> 00:45:29,544
you lost a pretty little
thing named Yasmine to me.

841
00:45:30,759 --> 00:45:33,240
And our wedding's right
around the corner.

842
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:35,848
- Well that game isn't
over yet playboy.

843
00:45:35,848 --> 00:45:38,241
And remember, I never lose.

844
00:45:40,763 --> 00:45:43,198
- Your mama lost when
she had your black.

845
00:45:58,767 --> 00:46:02,552
- Yo man, I was busting the
house party the other night,

846
00:46:02,552 --> 00:46:05,291
place went crazy dude.

847
00:46:05,291 --> 00:46:09,292
$25 for your CD, 25 baby.

848
00:46:09,292 --> 00:46:12,684
So hook me up, let
me get a couple more.

849
00:46:12,684 --> 00:46:14,510
- That's $20 homie.

850
00:46:16,294 --> 00:46:17,555
- So what's up, y'all performing

851
00:46:17,555 --> 00:46:18,729
at the platinum
club tomorrow night?

852
00:46:18,729 --> 00:46:20,079
- Oh for sure little homie.

853
00:46:20,079 --> 00:46:21,818
- All right me and my
boys will be there.

854
00:46:21,818 --> 00:46:22,644
Peace out dog.

855
00:46:22,644 --> 00:46:24,818
- All right, I hate that.

856
00:46:27,775 --> 00:46:31,080
- Excuse me, can I
get one of those CDs?

857
00:46:33,428 --> 00:46:35,428
- This might be a
little too explicit

858
00:46:35,428 --> 00:46:36,778
and funky for you pops.

859
00:46:36,778 --> 00:46:38,343
But I got some Isley
Brothers in the truck

860
00:46:38,343 --> 00:46:39,387
if you want to buy that.

861
00:46:39,387 --> 00:46:41,648
- I think I can handle it.

862
00:46:41,648 --> 00:46:44,780
- I'm gonna hook you up
but I got to warn you.

863
00:46:44,780 --> 00:46:47,302
These beats are off
the funk richter scale.

864
00:46:47,302 --> 00:46:49,869
So turn it down real low
when you listen to it

865
00:46:49,869 --> 00:46:51,999
so that you don't blow
your hearing aids.

866
00:46:54,043 --> 00:46:54,870
$10.

867
00:47:11,829 --> 00:47:14,440
♪ Sometimes I hurt so bad ♪

868
00:47:14,440 --> 00:47:17,658

(Kwame yelling loudly)

886
00:48:33,590 --> 00:48:37,506
(Yasmine screaming loudly)

887
00:48:44,768 --> 00:48:48,899
(Kwame screaming playfully)

888
00:48:48,899 --> 00:48:50,986
- The phone, the
phone, the phone.

889
00:48:50,986 --> 00:48:53,336
I got to get the phone,
it might be your mom.

890
00:48:53,336 --> 00:48:55,466
- Okay but no funny
stuff colored boy.

891
00:48:55,466 --> 00:48:58,031
- No funny stuff, I'm
picking up the phone.

892
00:49:01,554 --> 00:49:03,337
Who this?

893
00:49:03,337 --> 00:49:04,164
Yeah this is him.

894
00:49:05,904 --> 00:49:07,426
For real?

895
00:49:07,426 --> 00:49:09,774
Yeah yeah yeah that's
cool, that's cool.

896
00:49:09,774 --> 00:49:11,644
All right, I'll be there.

897
00:49:12,819 --> 00:49:16,949
That was Sy Jackson,
executive at Sky High Records.

898
00:49:16,949 --> 00:49:18,732
He said somehow, the
tape that I produced

899
00:49:18,732 --> 00:49:22,561
came across his desk and he
wants me in his office tomorrow.

900
00:49:22,561 --> 00:49:24,431
- That's great baby,
congratulations.

901
00:49:27,170 --> 00:49:28,518
- This calls for a celebration.

902
00:49:28,518 --> 00:49:30,040
Let's go in the room
and play wrestlers

903
00:49:30,040 --> 00:49:33,215
so I can put the smack down.

904
00:49:33,215 --> 00:49:34,825
- And we can get to that after

905
00:49:34,825 --> 00:49:37,824
this diva soaks you
from head to toe.

906
00:49:37,824 --> 00:49:39,957
- Baby whoa whoa
that was an accident.

907
00:49:39,957 --> 00:49:42,956
I didn't mean to get you all
wet, besides you look good.

908
00:49:44,174 --> 00:49:47,002
All right maybe you
don't look exactly good,

909
00:49:47,002 --> 00:49:48,306
and your hair is nappy

910
00:49:48,306 --> 00:49:50,438
and your face is all
smeared up to be damned.

911
00:49:50,438 --> 00:49:53,655
But that ain't no reason
for no spray down.

912
00:49:53,655 --> 00:49:57,614
Yasmine, this black on
black crime has got to stop.

913
00:49:57,614 --> 00:50:00,613
Put the gun down.

914
00:50:02,745 --> 00:50:03,701
Damn.

915
00:50:03,701 --> 00:50:05,831
(Kwame screaming playfully)

916
00:50:05,831 --> 00:50:08,051
- Tell Mr. B Love
that the soundtrack

917
00:50:08,051 --> 00:50:10,268
will be completed in
the next few weeks

918
00:50:10,268 --> 00:50:12,964
and will not hold up
the release of the film.

919
00:50:16,662 --> 00:50:18,966
- Mr. Jackson, I'm sorry.

920
00:50:18,966 --> 00:50:20,489
I didn't realize in
the parking lot--

921
00:50:20,489 --> 00:50:21,967
- Save your breath kid.

922
00:50:26,055 --> 00:50:28,403
That's the script to
B Love's new movie.

923
00:50:28,403 --> 00:50:30,230
He's a hot new filmmaker.

924
00:50:30,230 --> 00:50:34,232
Produce and write a song
for page 47, scene 21.

925
00:50:34,232 --> 00:50:37,363
Use the female artist
featured in your demo.

926
00:50:37,363 --> 00:50:39,537
You have two weeks
to submit it to me.

927
00:50:39,537 --> 00:50:42,190
If I like it, we talk contracts.

928
00:50:42,190 --> 00:50:44,103
If not, no luck.

929
00:50:44,103 --> 00:50:45,321
Any questions?

930
00:50:45,321 --> 00:50:46,669
- No sir.

931
00:50:46,669 --> 00:50:48,931
- Good, now get the
hell out of here.

932
00:50:58,326 --> 00:51:00,239
(all cooing softly)

933
00:51:00,239 --> 00:51:02,325
- Kwame gonna like that.

934
00:51:04,978 --> 00:51:07,805
(laughing loudly)

935
00:52:02,646 --> 00:52:05,342
- I'm laid all out
and you laughing?

936
00:52:06,560 --> 00:52:10,213
I'm taking my black
home, I'm tired.

937
00:52:10,213 --> 00:52:12,474
- Kwame, you play
basketball for hours.

938
00:52:12,474 --> 00:52:15,041
We've been here all of 10
minutes and you're tired?

939
00:52:15,041 --> 00:52:16,693
That must've been a
hell of a bachelor party

940
00:52:16,693 --> 00:52:18,127
you had last night.

941
00:52:18,127 --> 00:52:20,520
I'm sure you had four or five
naked skanks running around.

942
00:52:20,520 --> 00:52:23,216
- No baby, it was civilized.

943
00:52:23,216 --> 00:52:26,477
Just a bunch of fellas
chilling, playing dominoes.

944
00:52:29,175 --> 00:52:31,653
What are you asking some
like that for anyway?

945
00:52:31,653 --> 00:52:33,783
What, you got a
guilty conscience?

946
00:52:33,783 --> 00:52:35,262
What y'all have some
male Chippendales

947
00:52:35,262 --> 00:52:36,611
dancers at the party?

948
00:52:36,611 --> 00:52:39,135
- Please, it was just
the girls sitting around

949
00:52:39,135 --> 00:52:40,525
playing bid wiz.

950
00:52:42,787 --> 00:52:44,221
Hey isn't that Lance?

951
00:52:46,353 --> 00:52:48,875
Damn, she be pimping him.

952
00:52:50,571 --> 00:52:53,572
- [Cooper] Worse than a damn
job, can't take a time off.

953
00:52:53,572 --> 00:52:55,312
Can't call in sick.

954
00:52:55,312 --> 00:52:57,182
- [Iggy] She will be
pimping you with ultimatums

955
00:52:57,182 --> 00:52:58,574
for the rest of your life.

956
00:53:02,401 --> 00:53:05,706
- Look at you, about
to be a husband.

957
00:53:05,706 --> 00:53:07,663
And you still need your--

958
00:53:07,663 --> 00:53:09,750
- Mama.

959
00:53:09,750 --> 00:53:12,838
- Please, I used to wipe
your butt, quit tripping.

960
00:53:12,838 --> 00:53:16,057
- [Reverend] Places everyone,
showtime's in 10 minutes.

961
00:53:17,142 --> 00:53:19,275
- Congratulations, son.

962
00:53:30,929 --> 00:53:33,278
- I want you to
remember one thing.

963
00:53:33,278 --> 00:53:36,802
When that reverend tells
you, you may kiss the bride,

964
00:53:36,802 --> 00:53:38,671
I want you to do it like a man.

965
00:53:38,671 --> 00:53:41,019
I want you to grab that, that--

966
00:53:42,194 --> 00:53:43,019
- Yasmine?

967
00:53:43,019 --> 00:53:44,107
- That Scrasmine.

968
00:53:44,107 --> 00:53:44,933
- Yasmine.

969
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:47,195
- Whatever.

970
00:53:47,195 --> 00:53:50,326
I want you to grab
that Scrasmine,

971
00:53:50,326 --> 00:53:51,804
I want you to
slobber up and down,

972
00:53:51,804 --> 00:53:54,979
I want you to stick your
tongue so far down her throat

973
00:53:54,979 --> 00:53:56,415
you touch her tonsils.

974
00:53:57,677 --> 00:53:59,372
She can feel that way down here.

975
00:53:59,372 --> 00:54:02,025
Way down here, you understand?

976
00:54:02,025 --> 00:54:04,721
See that way, you get
control of the marriage

977
00:54:04,721 --> 00:54:06,678
right from the get go.

978
00:54:06,678 --> 00:54:08,896
From the beginning, right
down here to the end,

979
00:54:08,896 --> 00:54:11,070
you got control here here here.

980
00:54:12,679 --> 00:54:14,723
Stay strong little one.

981
00:54:14,723 --> 00:54:15,550
Give me some love.

982
00:54:15,550 --> 00:54:17,854
(yelling)

983
00:54:21,944 --> 00:54:24,595
- Honey you look more
beautiful as a bride

984
00:54:24,595 --> 00:54:27,032
than I did 27 years ago.

985
00:54:27,032 --> 00:54:29,206
- She also 200 pound lighter
than you were then too.

986
00:54:29,206 --> 00:54:31,163
That's a fact.
- Okay okay,

987
00:54:31,163 --> 00:54:33,902
I hate to cut this
sentimental moment short,

988
00:54:33,902 --> 00:54:35,817
but it's time to get started.

989
00:54:43,384 --> 00:54:44,339
- Love you.

990
00:54:50,994 --> 00:54:53,082
- You look so beautiful.

991
00:54:55,474 --> 00:54:58,212
- May god strike you
dead before you say I do.

992
00:54:59,344 --> 00:55:01,214
- Thanks for your support.

993
00:55:01,214 --> 00:55:02,171
- Don't mention it.

994
00:55:20,610 --> 00:55:23,003
- All right, you
ready to do this dog?

995
00:55:23,003 --> 00:55:24,439
- I don't know dog.

996
00:55:25,698 --> 00:55:27,525
- What do you mean
you don't know man?

997
00:55:27,525 --> 00:55:29,831
Half of Yasmine's family
flown in from Chinatown

998
00:55:29,831 --> 00:55:31,657
and you talking
about, you don't know?

999
00:55:31,657 --> 00:55:33,484
Come on.
- My bad, my bad man.

1000
00:55:33,484 --> 00:55:35,572
I'm just, the butterflies
got me tripping, man.

1001
00:55:35,572 --> 00:55:36,396
Let's do this.

1002
00:55:36,396 --> 00:55:37,224
- Let's do it.

1003
00:55:38,572 --> 00:55:40,530
Yeah, come on baby let's do it.

1004
00:55:43,355 --> 00:55:44,182
Come on man.

1005
00:55:45,879 --> 00:55:48,313
(knocking)

1006
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:51,575
- Who is it?

1007
00:55:51,575 --> 00:55:53,836
- [Kwame] It's Kwame.

1008
00:55:53,836 --> 00:55:55,968
- Kwame, what are
you doing here?

1009
00:55:55,968 --> 00:55:57,969
Now you know you're not
supposed to see the bride

1010
00:55:57,969 --> 00:55:58,968
before the wedding.

1011
00:55:58,968 --> 00:56:00,099
- I need to speak to Yasmine.

1012
00:56:00,099 --> 00:56:01,838
- [Tymika] Kwame.

1013
00:56:01,838 --> 00:56:04,406
- [Yasmine] It's okay girl,
we'll talk through the door.

1014
00:56:04,406 --> 00:56:06,623
- All right but if
y'all have bad luck,

1015
00:56:06,623 --> 00:56:08,754
don't say I didn't
try to prevent that.

1016
00:56:12,841 --> 00:56:16,321
- Can't believe we're
finally getting married,

1017
00:56:16,321 --> 00:56:17,799
aren't you excited?

1018
00:56:18,800 --> 00:56:20,236
- Yeah?

1019
00:56:20,236 --> 00:56:21,582
- Well what is it Kwame

1020
00:56:21,582 --> 00:56:24,019
that it couldn't wait
until after the wedding?

1021
00:56:24,019 --> 00:56:26,237
- I just wanted to
say that I love you,

1022
00:56:27,368 --> 00:56:31,325
Yasmine Denise
Brooks, one more time.

1023
00:56:33,586 --> 00:56:34,673
- I love you too.

1024
00:56:46,286 --> 00:56:50,069
(guests chatting quietly)

1025
00:57:45,823 --> 00:57:47,649
- Let's do this baby.

1026
00:57:47,649 --> 00:57:49,432
Come on man, it's showtime.

1027
00:57:53,781 --> 00:57:58,217
"Yas, I can't do it,
please forgive me, Kwame."

1028
00:58:00,305 --> 00:58:01,132
Damn.

1029
00:58:12,307 --> 00:58:15,613
- You see what had happened
was, the timing wasn't right.

1030
00:58:15,613 --> 00:58:19,179
I mean, I ain't no
astrologer or nothing,

1031
00:58:19,179 --> 00:58:22,875
but the stars wasn't aligned
properly on that day.

1032
00:58:22,875 --> 00:58:23,703

I know what I did was
wrong and I'm sorry.

1040
00:59:24,152 --> 00:59:25,588

00:59:28,675 --> 00:59:30,416
- Why are you here?

1044
00:59:30,416 --> 00:59:32,937
- Because I love
you, I miss you.

1045
00:59:32,937 --> 00:59:34,112
- Save it all right?

1046
00:59:34,112 --> 00:59:36,199
- Look Yas, I want
us to be together.

1047
00:59:36,199 --> 00:59:39,157
But marriage is a
giant step right now,

1048
00:59:39,157 --> 00:59:41,897
a step that I'm just
not ready to take.

1049
00:59:41,897 --> 00:59:43,505
So how come we can't
go back to kicking it

1050
00:59:43,505 --> 00:59:45,244
like we used to with
you being my woman

1051
00:59:45,244 --> 00:59:46,636
and me being your man?

1052
00:59:46,636 --> 00:59:49,594
- I can't believe you
could even come up in here

1053
00:59:49,594 --> 00:59:52,422
and say something like
that after what you did.

1054
00:59:54,552 --> 00:59:59,075
- I know what went down
was wrong, I messed up.

1055
00:59:59,075 --> 01:00:02,860
- Messed up? No,
what you did was, up.

1056
01:00:03,728 --> 01:00:05,251
You hurt me Kwame.

1057
01:00:05,251 --> 01:00:06,947
- I'm sorry Yas--

1058
01:00:06,947 --> 01:00:09,818
- What was supposed to be
happiest day of my life

1059
01:00:09,818 --> 01:00:12,643
turned out to be the most
humiliating and embarrassing.

1060
01:00:14,079 --> 01:00:16,209
And your trifling didn't
even have the balls

1061
01:00:16,209 --> 01:00:18,209
to tell me to my
face like a man.

1062
01:00:18,209 --> 01:00:19,992
- Baby I blew it, okay?

1063
01:00:20,820 --> 01:00:22,299
I messed up big time.

1064
01:00:22,299 --> 01:00:25,125
My actions were those
of a punk coward.

1065
01:00:25,125 --> 01:00:26,777
- I don't want to hear this.

1066
01:00:26,777 --> 01:00:29,214
Your whole program is tired.

1067
01:00:29,214 --> 01:00:31,258
- I'm sorry Yasmine.

1068
01:00:31,258 --> 01:00:34,433
- Yes you are, you're one sorry.

1069
01:00:37,520 --> 01:00:39,434
- I bet he trifling too.

1070
01:00:53,351 --> 01:00:57,264
- It's going to take some
time and a lot of hard work,

1071
01:00:57,264 --> 01:01:01,135
but we can overcome this
baby, I know we can.

1072
01:01:02,179 --> 01:01:03,875
- Let me break it down for you.

1073
01:01:04,787 --> 01:01:06,744
There is no we.

1074
01:01:08,050 --> 01:01:12,137
It's over, kaput, done,
finished, finito, comprende?

1075
01:01:12,137 --> 01:01:15,094
I have outgrown you and
this whole situation.

1076
01:01:16,704 --> 01:01:18,660
- So what I mean, what you're,

1077
01:01:18,660 --> 01:01:21,011
you're not trying
to talk about this?

1078
01:01:21,011 --> 01:01:22,401
- No.

1079
01:01:22,401 --> 01:01:26,097
Now if you'll excuse me,
I'm in the middle of moving.

1080
01:01:26,097 --> 01:01:27,619
- Look, Yasmine--

1081
01:01:27,619 --> 01:01:28,707
- Bye.

1082
01:01:56,932 --> 01:01:59,542
(TV blaring)

1083
01:02:03,282 --> 01:02:05,238
- Oh, snap.

1084
01:02:05,238 --> 01:02:09,369
Confirmation to the Kwame
site, brother is back in town.

1085
01:02:11,066 --> 01:02:15,024
- I didn't hear a knock at the
door nor me saying come in.

1086
01:02:15,024 --> 01:02:17,416
- It's probably cause
you didn't say it fool.

1087
01:02:19,112 --> 01:02:22,374
Damn home boy, looks like
you've been burglarized

1088
01:02:22,374 --> 01:02:23,679
or something up in here.

1089
01:02:27,593 --> 01:02:29,028
- What you doing?

1090
01:02:29,028 --> 01:02:30,201
- My hands is clean.

1091
01:02:32,724 --> 01:02:34,551
Yo you missed it.

1092
01:02:34,551 --> 01:02:37,420
Yasmine left the church
on y'all's wedding day,

1093
01:02:37,420 --> 01:02:38,725
she flipped out.

1094
01:02:44,162 --> 01:02:47,162
Scooping up your gear so quick.

1095
01:02:47,162 --> 01:02:49,860
Make your head spin
worse than the exorcist.

1096
01:02:49,860 --> 01:02:51,513
- Is those my boots?

1097
01:02:51,513 --> 01:02:54,078
- Oh look at the time.

1098
01:02:54,078 --> 01:02:55,382
I got to get out of here now

1099
01:02:55,382 --> 01:02:57,209
and finish delivering
yesterday's mail.

1100
01:02:57,209 --> 01:02:59,644
You know what I'm
saying, all right peace.

1101
01:03:02,428 --> 01:03:03,820
Mookie and them challenged us

1102
01:03:03,820 --> 01:03:06,429
to another basketball
game tomorrow.

1103
01:03:06,429 --> 01:03:09,995
11 o'clock for two grand.

1104
01:03:09,995 --> 01:03:11,429
You trying to be down or what?

1105
01:03:11,429 --> 01:03:13,604
- Man where are we going
to get that kind of money?

1106
01:03:13,604 --> 01:03:16,431
- Look, we ain't never
lost two games in a row.

1107
01:03:16,431 --> 01:03:18,301
The fools can't beat us again.

1108
01:03:18,301 --> 01:03:20,649
You just had an off day.

1109
01:03:20,649 --> 01:03:22,519
- Man I know that
but I'm saying,

1110
01:03:22,519 --> 01:03:25,216
Mookie like you to show
the skrilla up front.

1111
01:03:26,391 --> 01:03:28,478
- Player player player,

1112
01:03:28,478 --> 01:03:31,347
I got it covered, baby, covered.

1113
01:03:31,347 --> 01:03:33,263
- Is that somebody's
money out the mail?

1114
01:03:33,263 --> 01:03:35,349
- Look, we be telling
these fools all the time,

1115
01:03:35,349 --> 01:03:38,219
do not send cash in the mail.

1116
01:03:38,219 --> 01:03:40,829
It got a tendency to get lost.

1117
01:03:42,351 --> 01:03:44,830
So you're trying
to be down or what?

1118
01:03:44,830 --> 01:03:46,308
- I'll be there.

1119
01:03:47,439 --> 01:03:49,483
- [Iggy] Can you
really try to be there?

1120
01:03:49,483 --> 01:03:51,571
- Damn man I said I'll be there.

1121
01:03:51,571 --> 01:03:54,702
- All right but you
better not be late either.

1122
01:04:05,270 --> 01:04:08,836
- Fellas fellas, it's 11:45 man.

1123
01:04:10,793 --> 01:04:13,838
Might as well forfeit
and come out of pocket.

1124
01:04:13,838 --> 01:04:15,490
Come on,

1125
01:04:15,490 --> 01:04:16,316
come on.

1126
01:04:17,839 --> 01:04:19,361
Don't make this any harder
than it needs to be,

1127
01:04:19,361 --> 01:04:20,448
let's do this.

1128
01:04:24,058 --> 01:04:25,188
Come on Iggy.

1129
01:04:31,407 --> 01:04:34,105
That's what I'm talking about.

1130
01:04:40,800 --> 01:04:42,192
- [TV Host] On the
next Terry Ringer Show,

1131
01:04:42,192 --> 01:04:45,194
transvestites and
midgets who live alone.

1132
01:04:53,283 --> 01:04:55,979
- Hey mama, how you doing?

1133
01:04:55,979 --> 01:04:59,198
- Oh I'm fine, question
is how are you?

1134
01:04:59,198 --> 01:05:00,502
- Oh, I'm cool.

1135
01:05:00,502 --> 01:05:02,850
I mean, I've had better
days but you know.

1136
01:05:04,807 --> 01:05:06,199
- I spoke to Iggy,

1137
01:05:06,199 --> 01:05:09,505
he said you stood him
and Scooter up today.

1138
01:05:09,505 --> 01:05:10,767
- I forgot.

1139
01:05:10,767 --> 01:05:14,202
- Kwame I raised a
stronger man than this.

1140
01:05:14,202 --> 01:05:16,898
You can't run from fear.

1141
01:05:16,898 --> 01:05:19,724
You have to face it head on.

1142
01:05:19,724 --> 01:05:23,204
You can't sit around here
wallowing in self pity.

1143
01:05:23,204 --> 01:05:25,552
- Me and my TV is
having a good day.

1144
01:05:25,552 --> 01:05:28,379
Don't rock our world,
Mama, we is comfortable.

1145
01:05:28,379 --> 01:05:30,553
- Well, you need to come
out of your comfort zone.

1146
01:05:30,553 --> 01:05:32,815
'Cause right now you're
acting like a punk.

1147
01:05:33,946 --> 01:05:36,163
You act like you lost
your best friend.

1148
01:05:36,163 --> 01:05:37,512
- I did mama.

1149
01:05:37,512 --> 01:05:39,207
Yasmine quit me,

1150
01:05:39,207 --> 01:05:41,773
I missed the deadline to submit
my tape to Sky High Records.

1151
01:05:41,773 --> 01:05:43,469
Everything is
jacked up right now.

1152
01:05:43,469 --> 01:05:45,252
- So the chips are
down right now.

1153
01:05:45,252 --> 01:05:50,340
But you let your obstacles be
a detour, not a derailment.

1154
01:05:50,340 --> 01:05:52,037
If you want to be a producer,

1155
01:05:52,037 --> 01:05:54,821
then you get up and you produce.

1156
01:05:54,821 --> 01:05:56,734
If you want Yasmine back,

1157
01:05:56,734 --> 01:05:58,908
go win the woman
back or get over it

1158
01:05:58,908 --> 01:06:01,258
because nothing's
going to happen

1159
01:06:01,258 --> 01:06:05,301
as long as you sit on your and
watch that Terry Ringer show.

1160
01:06:05,301 --> 01:06:09,519
Kwame, it is time for you
to grow up and be a man.

1161
01:06:28,003 --> 01:06:29,351
- Mr. Jackson.

1162
01:06:29,351 --> 01:06:31,352
- Don't be running up
on me like that boy,

1163
01:06:31,352 --> 01:06:33,743
unless you trying
to get cold cut.

1164
01:06:33,743 --> 01:06:35,743
- I'm sorry, I didn't mean
to startle you or nothing.

1165
01:06:35,743 --> 01:06:37,659
- This is the executive floor,

1166
01:06:37,659 --> 01:06:39,266
how the hell did
you get up here?

1167
01:06:39,266 --> 01:06:41,442
- I slipped your
secretary my last fifty.

1168
01:06:44,050 --> 01:06:45,356
- Give me security please.

1169
01:06:45,356 --> 01:06:47,139
- Mr. Jackson, please, please

1170
01:06:47,139 --> 01:06:49,095
just give me 30
seconds of your time.

1171
01:06:49,095 --> 01:06:50,444
- What do you want boy?

1172
01:06:50,444 --> 01:06:52,097
I'm about to have an
important meeting.

1173
01:06:52,097 --> 01:06:53,271
- I know I missed the deadline

1174
01:06:53,271 --> 01:06:54,879
to submit my songs
for the movie,

1175
01:06:54,879 --> 01:06:57,228
but if I can get it to you
within the next couple of weeks,

1176
01:06:57,228 --> 01:06:59,316
is there any way that you
would even consider it?

1177
01:06:59,316 --> 01:07:01,664
- I'm submitting the
package of songs tomorrow

1178
01:07:01,664 --> 01:07:03,533
to the executive producer
of the soundtrack,

1179
01:07:03,533 --> 01:07:04,969
Mr. B Love himself

1180
01:07:04,969 --> 01:07:07,275
who's going to choose the
songs he likes for the film.

1181
01:07:07,275 --> 01:07:10,231
- Mr. Jackson, please, I've
had some really rocky times.

1182
01:07:10,231 --> 01:07:11,971
Me and the missus
to be fell out.

1183
01:07:11,971 --> 01:07:15,102
- Get it on my desk by
tomorrow morning at 9:00 a.m.

1184
01:07:15,102 --> 01:07:17,800
If I like it, I'll submit
it with the package

1185
01:07:17,800 --> 01:07:19,886
just because I like your work.

1186
01:07:19,886 --> 01:07:22,582
But if it arrives at nine
oh one, it's too late.

1187
01:07:22,582 --> 01:07:23,670
Now, get out.

1188
01:07:23,670 --> 01:07:24,802
- Thanks Mr. Jackson.

1189
01:07:36,848 --> 01:07:38,195
- Can I come in?

1190
01:07:38,195 --> 01:07:41,934
- Oh yeah yeah yeah,
come on in Chantal.

1191
01:07:41,934 --> 01:07:45,633
Yo, I appreciate you coming
over here on such short notice.

1192
01:07:45,633 --> 01:07:47,677
- Oh, no problem you know
I'd drive the world for you,

1193
01:07:47,677 --> 01:07:48,719
but I mean you okay?

1194
01:07:48,719 --> 01:07:50,067
I heard about your
disappearance.

1195
01:07:50,067 --> 01:07:52,155
- Yeah I was just
on a DL for a minute

1196
01:07:52,155 --> 01:07:53,808
building those mind muscles,

1197
01:07:53,808 --> 01:07:55,591
but I'm cool thanks for asking.

1198
01:07:55,591 --> 01:07:56,418
- No problem.

1199
01:07:58,896 --> 01:08:02,898
- Yeah, so yeah, let's
just jump right into this

1200
01:08:02,898 --> 01:08:04,942
and let's just do it.

1201
01:08:06,552 --> 01:08:11,770
♪ Why can't it be
a little easier ♪

1202
01:08:12,769 --> 01:08:14,509
♪ Some days I laugh ♪

1203
01:08:14,509 --> 01:08:17,944

1205
01:08:26,035 --> 01:08:28,556
(clapping loudly)

1206
01:08:28,556 --> 01:08:29,383
- Yeah,

1207
01:08:31,036 --> 01:08:31,861
yeah,

1208
01:08:32,906 --> 01:08:34,602
that was tight.

1209
01:08:34,602 --> 01:08:36,559
Girl, you got sick with it,
that's what I'm talking about.

1210
01:08:36,559 --> 01:08:39,647
- Only 'cause I had a dope
producer to bring it out of me.

1211
01:08:43,821 --> 01:08:45,430
What was that for?

1212
01:08:45,430 --> 01:08:46,256

hold up, hold up.

1225
01:09:27,702 --> 01:09:30,052
- What's the matter,
that didn't feel good?

1226
01:09:30,052 --> 01:09:31,398
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1227
01:09:31,398 --> 01:09:32,920
It felt real good,
it felt incredible.

1228
01:09:32,920 --> 01:09:36,183
But I mean, I just
can't do this you know?

1229
01:09:36,183 --> 01:09:38,227
Nothing to do with you
'cause you got it going on

1230
01:09:38,227 --> 01:09:40,967
three or four times
over with the law loud.

1231
01:09:40,967 --> 01:09:42,620
It's just me.

1232
01:09:43,488 --> 01:09:45,402
- It's you or Yasmine?

1233
01:09:46,403 --> 01:09:48,055
- I love that woman.

1234
01:09:49,665 --> 01:09:53,101
That's what my heart is
and that's where I belong.

1235
01:09:55,753 --> 01:09:57,014
- I can respect that
Kwame, but I mean

1236
01:09:57,014 --> 01:10:00,103
if you ever change
your mind, I mean.

1237
01:10:01,668 --> 01:10:02,494
Friends?

1238
01:10:02,494 --> 01:10:03,321
- For sure.

1239
01:10:06,887 --> 01:10:07,712
- All right.

1240
01:10:09,279 --> 01:10:11,453
- Yo, I'll let you
know what the haps is

1241
01:10:11,453 --> 01:10:12,627
when I hear from Sky High.

1242
01:10:23,892 --> 01:10:24,717
Damn.

1243
01:10:33,459 --> 01:10:35,763
(snoring)

1244
01:10:36,807 --> 01:10:39,765
(phone ringing)

1245
01:10:43,462 --> 01:10:44,288
Who this?

1246
01:10:45,896 --> 01:10:47,723
Yeah yeah yeah that's cool.

1247
01:10:49,332 --> 01:10:52,768
Thanks Mr. Jackson, okay,
all right I'll see you then.

1248
01:10:54,464 --> 01:10:55,682
Yes.

1249
01:10:58,857 --> 01:11:01,336
- So then I just got real
ugly with that trick.

1250
01:11:01,336 --> 01:11:02,728
You know what I'm saying?

1251
01:11:02,728 --> 01:11:04,814
I told her, look, if
we are in the night,

1252
01:11:04,814 --> 01:11:07,076
then you going to
have to regurgitate

1253
01:11:07,076 --> 01:11:09,860
all I just bought you
and I mean everything.

1254
01:11:09,860 --> 01:11:12,164
I'm talking about the
fries, the hamburger,

1255
01:11:12,164 --> 01:11:13,860
the shake, all of that.

1256
01:11:13,860 --> 01:11:16,340
She said, I can't do that
what are you talking about?

1257
01:11:16,340 --> 01:11:18,514
I say, the hell you can't.

1258
01:11:18,514 --> 01:11:21,559
Then I slipped three or
four x-lax up in her b pod.

1259
01:11:21,559 --> 01:11:22,907
- No.

1260
01:11:22,907 --> 01:11:25,081
- She gonna be,
'til Tuesday kid.

1261
01:11:26,517 --> 01:11:28,604
- Yo fellas man,
hold up, hold up.

1262
01:11:28,604 --> 01:11:31,126
I want to apologize for missing
that game the other day dog,

1263
01:11:31,126 --> 01:11:33,562
I feel responsible that
y'all lost that money.

1264
01:11:33,562 --> 01:11:35,389
So I set up another game
with Mookie and them

1265
01:11:35,389 --> 01:11:37,085
tomorrow for 10 G.

1266
01:11:37,085 --> 01:11:38,389
- Now where are we supposed to
get that kind of money from?

1267
01:11:38,389 --> 01:11:39,693
- Hey, hey, hey,

1268
01:11:39,693 --> 01:11:41,129
I can go through the
mail like I usually do,

1269
01:11:41,129 --> 01:11:42,565
you know what I'm saying?

1270
01:11:42,565 --> 01:11:44,217
See what I come up with.

1271
01:11:44,217 --> 01:11:47,392
- Sky High Records optioned
one of my songs for five grand.

1272
01:11:47,392 --> 01:11:49,045
And I put up all
my music equipment

1273
01:11:49,045 --> 01:11:50,000
to represent the rest.

1274
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:51,566
- Kwame, you can't do that, man.

1275
01:11:51,566 --> 01:11:54,088
Your equipment is worth
way more than that.

1276
01:11:54,088 --> 01:11:57,176
- I know, man but that's all
that Mook would give me for it.

1277
01:11:59,874 --> 01:12:02,395
- Cool man, cool we'll be there.

1278
01:12:02,395 --> 01:12:05,049
- No, no, no, no, no I
can't let you do that Kwame.

1279
01:12:05,049 --> 01:12:07,657
We know that music is the
most important thing to you.

1280
01:12:07,657 --> 01:12:09,483
Next to Yasmine, that's
the most important thing

1281
01:12:09,483 --> 01:12:11,180
in the world to you.

1282
01:12:11,180 --> 01:12:13,529
- Yeah man but it's on me that
y'all lost y'all money dog.

1283
01:12:13,529 --> 01:12:15,877
It's time I stood up and
started taking responsibility

1284
01:12:15,877 --> 01:12:17,486
for my own man.

1285
01:12:17,486 --> 01:12:19,052
You got a wife
and a house Scoot.

1286
01:12:19,052 --> 01:12:20,749
I still never really
made it up to you

1287
01:12:20,749 --> 01:12:22,618
for y'all's honeymoon.

1288
01:12:22,618 --> 01:12:24,097
You need your money.

1289
01:12:24,097 --> 01:12:26,140
- Yo and I need my money,
you know what I'm saying?

1290
01:12:26,140 --> 01:12:28,663
All of them hoochies
and hood rats.

1291
01:12:28,663 --> 01:12:29,706
- Yo, what time?

1292
01:12:29,706 --> 01:12:30,489
- Nine o'clock.

1293
01:12:33,142 --> 01:12:34,098
- It's on.

1294
01:12:34,098 --> 01:12:35,577
- Yeah.

1295
01:12:35,577 --> 01:12:37,404
- Hey yo Scoot though, man.

1296
01:12:37,404 --> 01:12:39,623
I need a place to crash
for a few days, man.

1297
01:12:39,623 --> 01:12:41,189
A brother done been evicted.

1298
01:12:41,189 --> 01:12:46,408
- No problem bro I got you,
but I gotta warn you man.

1299
01:12:47,276 --> 01:12:48,973
Yasmine staying at the house

1300
01:12:48,973 --> 01:12:50,278
while she's waiting on her
new place to get ready.

1301
01:12:52,017 --> 01:12:53,496
- How are you doing ladies?

1302
01:12:54,626 --> 01:12:56,540
How you doing Yasmine?

1303
01:12:56,540 --> 01:12:57,627
- Fine, thank you.

1304
01:13:01,671 --> 01:13:03,454
- I guess you heard I'm gonna
be sleeping on the couch

1305
01:13:03,454 --> 01:13:05,977
for a few days since
you took Scooter's

1306
01:13:05,977 --> 01:13:07,020
last vacant guest room.

1307
01:13:12,892 --> 01:13:14,850
I was going to see if you
wanted to kick it tonight.

1308
01:13:14,850 --> 01:13:16,980
Maybe rent some
movies or something

1309
01:13:16,980 --> 01:13:20,590
but it looks like you getting
ready to go somewhere.

1310
01:13:20,590 --> 01:13:21,503
- I got plans.

1311
01:13:23,243 --> 01:13:24,068
- That's cool.

1312
01:13:25,287 --> 01:13:26,418
I got these for you.

1313
01:13:27,591 --> 01:13:28,809
Hey Yasmine, you little
chocolate wonder.

1314
01:13:36,463 --> 01:13:39,724
I'll set it on the bed.

1315
01:13:40,595 --> 01:13:42,335
- Congratulations.

1316
01:13:42,335 --> 01:13:44,943
I heard about Sky High Records
optioning one of your songs.

1317
01:13:44,943 --> 01:13:46,596
I'm happy for you.

1318
01:13:46,596 --> 01:13:47,641
- Thanks shorty.

1319
01:13:49,380 --> 01:13:50,162
Yasmine.

1320
01:13:56,686 --> 01:14:01,253
- Girl I feel terrible, like
I shouldn't be doing this.

1321
01:14:01,253 --> 01:14:03,036
- Think about how
terrible you felt

1322
01:14:03,036 --> 01:14:05,601
being stood up at the altar.

1323
01:14:05,601 --> 01:14:06,950
Kwame.

1324
01:14:06,950 --> 01:14:09,558
- And I told Scooter,
you got here first.

1325
01:14:09,558 --> 01:14:11,037
Kwame needs to go
stay with his mom.

1326
01:14:11,037 --> 01:14:12,473
- She's in a hotel.

1327
01:14:12,473 --> 01:14:14,691
Her house is being painted.

1328
01:14:14,691 --> 01:14:15,518
- Whatever.

1329
01:14:16,777 --> 01:14:18,126
- I'm so nervous.

1330
01:14:18,126 --> 01:14:21,388
- Look, it's not like
you don't know the man.

1331
01:14:21,388 --> 01:14:22,910
Just be yourself

1332
01:14:22,910 --> 01:14:25,215
and order the most
expensive thing on the menu.

1333
01:14:26,824 --> 01:14:28,825
- What kind of
perfume should I wear?

1334
01:14:28,825 --> 01:14:33,131
- Well, I read in
Sister Girl magazine,

1335
01:14:33,131 --> 01:14:34,914
that the best perfume
for a woman to wear

1336
01:14:34,914 --> 01:14:37,349
is her own natural juices.

1337
01:14:37,349 --> 01:14:38,827
- Juices?

1338
01:14:38,827 --> 01:14:41,828
How many long Island iced
teas had you had that day?

1339
01:14:41,828 --> 01:14:42,698
- None girl.

1340
01:14:50,831 --> 01:14:55,005
- See right here, here
it is in black and white.

1341
01:14:55,005 --> 01:14:58,877
Though men often joke about
the smell of the vaginal area

1342
01:14:58,877 --> 01:15:02,530
and its juices, it
actually turns men on

1343
01:15:02,530 --> 01:15:04,921
and reminds them of
a romantic interlude.

1344
01:15:05,922 --> 01:15:09,358
If a woman wants to dab
her own natural juices

1345
01:15:09,358 --> 01:15:12,358
on her neck and behind her ears,

1346
01:15:12,358 --> 01:15:15,880
it is sure to drive a man crazy.

1347
01:15:20,794 --> 01:15:22,577
I'm gonna try it.

1348
01:15:22,577 --> 01:15:24,797
- You and this
magazine is trifling.

1349
01:15:43,583 --> 01:15:46,585
(doorbell ringing)

1350
01:15:53,326 --> 01:15:55,847
- I guess I'll get the door.

1351
01:16:00,328 --> 01:16:01,415
- What's up Kwame?

1352
01:16:02,675 --> 01:16:04,720
- The game ain't
'til tomorrow, bro.

1353
01:16:04,720 --> 01:16:06,241
And even then, you
don't need to be

1354
01:16:06,241 --> 01:16:07,981
trying to break a
brother off with roses.

1355
01:16:07,981 --> 01:16:10,026
'Cause I don't get
down like that.

1356
01:16:12,809 --> 01:16:14,939
- I didn't come here
to see you, man.

1357
01:16:14,939 --> 01:16:16,722
I came here to pick up my date.

1358
01:16:23,419 --> 01:16:25,943
- You with my boy's wife Tymkia?

1359
01:16:25,943 --> 01:16:30,945
Man I will whoop your.

1360
01:16:30,945 --> 01:16:32,771
- [Yasmine] He's
here to pick me up.

1361
01:16:46,208 --> 01:16:48,297
- Hey snuggles,
you look beautiful.

1362
01:16:50,080 --> 01:16:52,254
- You look very
handsome yourself.

1363
01:16:52,254 --> 01:16:53,340
- Thank you.

1364
01:16:53,340 --> 01:16:54,515
- Snuggles.

1365
01:16:56,081 --> 01:16:59,864
- Is that a tailor
made Italian cut suit?

1366
01:16:59,864 --> 01:17:01,561
- Why yes it is.

1367
01:17:02,909 --> 01:17:06,214
- Now remember, order the most
expensive thing on the menu

1368
01:17:06,214 --> 01:17:07,997
and bring me back a plate
of whatever you get.

1369
01:17:07,997 --> 01:17:10,345
Although I kinda got
a taste for chicken.

1370
01:17:10,345 --> 01:17:12,608
- I'm not bringing you no
plate girl, that is so ghetto.

1371
01:17:12,608 --> 01:17:15,304
- Come on Yas, you know black
folks do it all the time.

1372
01:17:15,304 --> 01:17:18,521
- I kind of got a taste
for some big pig feet.

1373
01:17:23,088 --> 01:17:24,696
- Yas we gotta get going, baby.

1374
01:17:24,696 --> 01:17:28,395
Our reservations at the
Chanderelle are in 30 minutes.

1375
01:17:31,090 --> 01:17:33,700
- Yas, can I holler at you
quick minute over here?

1376
01:17:33,700 --> 01:17:36,395
- No Kwame, we're late
for our reservation.

1377
01:17:36,395 --> 01:17:37,918
- It'll only take a second.

1378
01:17:37,918 --> 01:17:38,745
- Bye bye.

1379
01:17:47,050 --> 01:17:49,270
- Hey don't forget
my plate girl.

1380
01:17:49,270 --> 01:17:52,008
- Tymkia, what the hell
was that all about?

1381
01:17:52,008 --> 01:17:54,445
- I'm just trying to get
my eat on, I'm hungry.

1382
01:17:54,445 --> 01:17:57,748
- I'm talking about
Yasmine and Mookie.

1383
01:17:58,663 --> 01:18:01,663
- Well, to be honest, Kwame,

1384
01:18:01,663 --> 01:18:03,925
if I was her I would
do the same thing.

1385
01:18:03,925 --> 01:18:06,665
I lost a gang of respect for you

1386
01:18:06,665 --> 01:18:09,447
when you stood my
girl up at the altar.

1387
01:18:09,447 --> 01:18:11,230
When I heard you
was back in town,

1388
01:18:11,230 --> 01:18:13,101
I wanted to cut you.

1389
01:18:13,101 --> 01:18:15,145
Scooter wouldn't let me.

1390
01:18:15,145 --> 01:18:17,103
He saved your life, black.

1391
01:18:17,103 --> 01:18:19,016
- I know I screwed up all right?

1392
01:18:19,016 --> 01:18:22,059
- You can't blame her for
getting on with her life.

1393
01:18:22,059 --> 01:18:23,364
You made it perfectly clear

1394
01:18:23,364 --> 01:18:24,713
that you didn't
want to be with her.

1395
01:18:24,713 --> 01:18:27,366
So now she's going to
find somebody who does.

1396
01:18:28,583 --> 01:18:31,150
Oh, if you could
please tell old girl

1397
01:18:31,150 --> 01:18:32,673
to leave my plate on the table.

1398
01:18:35,759 --> 01:18:39,281
Kwam, you like my new perfume?

1399
01:18:40,847 --> 01:18:43,544
- Girl you smell
like a dead fish.

1400
01:18:43,544 --> 01:18:46,022
- See, that's why you
all by yourself tonight.

1401
01:18:50,024 --> 01:18:53,155
(soft upbeat music)

1402
01:19:07,028 --> 01:19:10,464
- Bye Mookie, I had a good time.

1403
01:19:10,464 --> 01:19:11,725
I'll see you later boo.

1404
01:19:18,510 --> 01:19:22,119
Kwame, what are
you still doing up?

1405
01:19:22,119 --> 01:19:23,077
- Watching TV.

1406
01:19:27,512 --> 01:19:29,034
- Okay, good night.

1407
01:19:30,904 --> 01:19:32,123
- Where have you been?

1408
01:19:33,862 --> 01:19:35,298
- Excuse me?

1409
01:19:35,298 --> 01:19:36,601
- You need to wipe that
joker smile off your face.

1410
01:19:36,601 --> 01:19:38,514
'Cause ain't nobody
making jokes.

1411
01:19:38,514 --> 01:19:40,210
Where have you been?

1412
01:19:40,210 --> 01:19:42,647
- Nonya, as in none
of your business.

1413
01:19:42,647 --> 01:19:44,343
- Ain't nobody playing
with you Yasmine.

1414
01:19:44,343 --> 01:19:47,561
- And I'm not playing with
you either Kwame Getman.

1415
01:19:47,561 --> 01:19:50,170
- You come walking
in here at dawn

1416
01:19:50,170 --> 01:19:52,867
with the sun hitting
you in the crack of your

1417
01:19:52,867 --> 01:19:56,564
talking about none of
my business, ain't cool.

1418
01:19:56,564 --> 01:19:58,129
- On the real Kwame,

1419
01:19:58,129 --> 01:20:00,998
you need to get some business
and stay out of mine.

1420
01:20:00,998 --> 01:20:03,217
- Was he playing
with my kitty cat?

1421
01:20:03,217 --> 01:20:04,087
- What?

1422
01:20:04,087 --> 01:20:05,522
- Did I stutter?

1423
01:20:05,522 --> 01:20:07,523
- First of all, it's not
your kitty cat, it's mine.

1424
01:20:07,523 --> 01:20:09,088
Second, let's not go there son

1425
01:20:09,088 --> 01:20:11,045
'cause you might get
your feelings hurt.

1426
01:20:11,045 --> 01:20:12,002
Now I'm going to bed

1427
01:20:12,002 --> 01:20:14,046
'cause you getting on my nerves.

1428
01:20:14,046 --> 01:20:15,351
- I'm not done talking to you,

1429
01:20:15,351 --> 01:20:17,004
don't walk away from me girl.

1430
01:20:56,752 --> 01:20:59,753
- Hey I just came to
wish you good luck.

1431
01:20:59,753 --> 01:21:01,363
- Thanks Chantal.

1432
01:21:05,146 --> 01:21:08,973
- Girl you gonna hook me up
with some of that punani, right?

1433
01:21:08,973 --> 01:21:10,799
Well how about, can
I just smell it?

1434
01:21:12,452 --> 01:21:14,367
- Yo, let's do this.

1435
01:21:18,281 --> 01:21:19,106
Come on.

1436
01:21:21,280 --> 01:21:24,282
(players shouting)

1437
01:21:39,677 --> 01:21:42,634
- That's what I'm talking about.

1438
01:22:08,118 --> 01:22:09,901
- Now that was a
killer crossover dog

1439
01:22:09,901 --> 01:22:11,251
but you don't know
nothing about that.

1440
01:22:11,251 --> 01:22:16,469
You know, my game is as
smooth as butter, boy.

1441
01:22:16,992 --> 01:22:17,992
Six nothing.

1442
01:22:17,992 --> 01:22:19,079
- Mookie.

1443
01:22:22,254 --> 01:22:24,819
- That's what I told
Yasmine last night.

1444
01:22:24,819 --> 01:22:27,864
And not only did she
do it, she loved it.

1445
01:22:31,213 --> 01:22:33,821
She tossed my salad too, boy.

1446
01:22:33,821 --> 01:22:37,344
(talking over each other)

1447
01:22:38,215 --> 01:22:39,910
- You take JD, I got Mookie.

1448
01:22:39,910 --> 01:22:43,346
No no no Kwame, come on.

1449
01:22:43,346 --> 01:22:45,086
Yo man.

1450
01:22:45,086 --> 01:22:48,869
You gotta get this
Yasmine your mind man,

1451
01:22:48,869 --> 01:22:50,392
just for a minute.

1452
01:22:50,392 --> 01:22:51,958
Yo, she still loves you man

1453
01:22:51,958 --> 01:22:53,348
but she's so hurt
by what you did

1454
01:22:53,348 --> 01:22:55,087
that she's trying
to hurt you back.

1455
01:22:56,349 --> 01:22:58,786
You need the weather
the storm brother.

1456
01:22:58,786 --> 01:23:03,872
Weather the storm and
she'll be back, you feel me?

1457
01:23:03,872 --> 01:23:06,135
All right, let's
get our hoops on.

1458
01:23:07,831 --> 01:23:09,091
Let's do this.

1459
01:23:20,269 --> 01:23:23,878
(shouting over each other)

1460
01:23:32,272 --> 01:23:34,663
(cheering)

1461
01:24:00,193 --> 01:24:03,107
(cheering loudly)

1462
01:24:11,325 --> 01:24:12,674
- You really mean what you said

1463
01:24:12,674 --> 01:24:14,022
about Yasmine coming
back to me, man?

1464
01:24:14,022 --> 01:24:15,109
I mean, did Tymkia
tell you that?

1465
01:24:15,109 --> 01:24:16,501
- Tymkia didn't tell me that,

1466
01:24:16,501 --> 01:24:18,980
that's just what
my gut says, man.

1467
01:24:18,980 --> 01:24:20,284
Look, the sooner
that you put this

1468
01:24:20,284 --> 01:24:21,371
Mookie thing outta your mind,

1469
01:24:21,371 --> 01:24:24,373
the sooner man that
y'all get back together.

1470
01:24:24,373 --> 01:24:26,329
But as long as she thinks
she's got your guard,

1471
01:24:26,329 --> 01:24:27,809
as long as she thinks that

1472
01:24:27,809 --> 01:24:30,635
is as long as she's going
to run the table on you man.

1473
01:24:30,635 --> 01:24:32,374
Good game, good game.

1474
01:24:33,810 --> 01:24:37,376
(whooping loudly)

1475
01:24:37,376 --> 01:24:39,071
- You the man.

1476
01:24:39,071 --> 01:24:41,115
- I gotta go handle
something real quick.

1477
01:24:42,160 --> 01:24:44,334
(cheering)

1478
01:24:46,378 --> 01:24:47,986
Can I holler at
you for a minute?

1479
01:24:52,120 --> 01:24:53,075
- What's up?

1480
01:24:53,075 --> 01:24:54,380
- I just want to apologize

1481
01:24:54,380 --> 01:24:55,903
for the way I've
been acting lately.

1482
01:24:55,903 --> 01:24:57,903
You know, what you
do is your business.

1483
01:24:57,903 --> 01:25:01,121
You know, if Mookie makes
you happy, then I'm happy.

1484
01:25:01,121 --> 01:25:02,427
We're just going to
kick back in the cut

1485
01:25:02,427 --> 01:25:04,166
and let you do your own thing.

1486
01:25:04,166 --> 01:25:05,556
- Excuse me, come again?

1487
01:25:05,556 --> 01:25:08,167
- I did not stutter
or stammer girl.

1488
01:25:08,167 --> 01:25:09,820
I'm happy to see you
moving on with your life.

1489
01:25:09,820 --> 01:25:13,516
And I'm realizing that it's
time for me to do the same.

1490
01:25:13,516 --> 01:25:14,341
- I see.

1491
01:25:15,516 --> 01:25:17,213
- Homies?

1492
01:25:17,213 --> 01:25:17,996
- Yeah.

1493
01:25:21,996 --> 01:25:23,605
- So we about to go
get something to eat,

1494
01:25:23,605 --> 01:25:25,128
you wanna roll?

1495
01:25:25,128 --> 01:25:28,171
- Thank you but no, Mookie
and I are going to brunch.

1496
01:25:30,998 --> 01:25:32,695
You played great out there.

1497
01:25:32,695 --> 01:25:35,392
I'm just sorry it was at
the expense of my man.

1498
01:25:35,392 --> 01:25:37,392
- Oh, he's your man now?

1499
01:25:37,392 --> 01:25:38,479
- Sort of.

1500
01:25:40,479 --> 01:25:42,524
- Well that's cool, that's cool.

1501
01:25:42,524 --> 01:25:45,523
You know, like I said, your
happiness is what's important.

1502
01:25:50,264 --> 01:25:51,743
- I better go.

1503
01:25:51,743 --> 01:25:53,135
- Yeah yeah yeah.

1504
01:25:53,135 --> 01:25:54,701
You don't want to
keep the Mookster

1505
01:25:54,701 --> 01:25:57,310
waiting or nothing like that.

1506
01:26:09,573 --> 01:26:12,922
(upbeat guitar music)

1507
01:26:26,709 --> 01:26:28,665
- [Yasmine] You can
do it, come on Mookie.

1508
01:26:28,665 --> 01:26:31,363
- [Mookie] Slow down.

1509
01:26:31,363 --> 01:26:34,712

Since we won some
of that money back,

1521
01:27:24,810 --> 01:27:27,724
well all of that money
back and then some,

1522
01:27:28,986 --> 01:27:32,640
I see a trip to
Jamaica, you know?

1523
01:27:32,640 --> 01:27:35,031
(laughing)

1524
01:27:48,122 --> 01:27:49,427
- What's up pimping?

1525
01:27:49,427 --> 01:27:51,644
Never known you to
be late for no party.

1526
01:27:55,254 --> 01:27:56,080
Oh,

1527
01:27:57,211 --> 01:27:58,603
what happened?

1528
01:27:58,603 --> 01:28:01,385
- Man me and Cassandra
fell out, all the way out.

1529
01:28:01,385 --> 01:28:02,603
I didn't even know
that she knew about

1530
01:28:02,603 --> 01:28:04,299
Roxanne, and Yvonne and LaToya

1531
01:28:04,299 --> 01:28:06,560
'til my black god
about the chair.

1532
01:28:08,389 --> 01:28:10,954
I knew that I should never
been talking to no barber.

1533
01:28:10,954 --> 01:28:12,346
You know what I'm saying?

1534
01:28:14,346 --> 01:28:16,303
Yo player, you're
taking this stuff

1535
01:28:16,303 --> 01:28:18,347
with Yasmine and
Mookie pretty cool.

1536
01:28:18,347 --> 01:28:22,260
- Man I just know our break
up's a temporary situation.

1537
01:28:22,260 --> 01:28:25,915
- Kwame, I need to talk to you.

1538
01:28:25,915 --> 01:28:28,480
- Girl, can't you see I'm
trying to get my grub on?

1539
01:28:28,480 --> 01:28:32,002
- Party people hold up,
I got an announcement.

1540
01:28:33,438 --> 01:28:35,308
What started off as a barbecue

1541
01:28:35,308 --> 01:28:38,049
has now turned into
an engagement party.

1542
01:28:38,049 --> 01:28:41,178
My mans right here,
Mookie Jenkins

1543
01:28:41,178 --> 01:28:44,832
will wed the lovely
Yasmine Brooks next week.

1544
01:28:44,832 --> 01:28:47,181
And everybody's invited.

1545
01:28:48,529 --> 01:28:52,616
So DJ, play a song for the
mister and missus to be.

1546
01:28:52,616 --> 01:28:54,617
(guests clapping)

1547
01:28:54,617 --> 01:28:55,531
- Congratulations.

1548
01:28:58,226 --> 01:28:59,227
- Kwame wait.

1549
01:29:03,489 --> 01:29:05,838
- We gotta dance baby,
this song's for us.

1550
01:29:10,751 --> 01:29:12,360
- Can I come in?

1551
01:29:12,360 --> 01:29:13,449
- Sure.

1552
01:29:21,799 --> 01:29:23,146
- Where are you going?

1553
01:29:23,146 --> 01:29:25,409
- I got me a little
spot in old town.

1554
01:29:28,191 --> 01:29:29,887
- You don't have to go.

1555
01:29:29,887 --> 01:29:34,497
- I was leaving anyway even
before the big announcement.

1556
01:29:34,497 --> 01:29:36,368
Just hadn't had a
chance to tell you.

1557
01:29:36,368 --> 01:29:37,455
- You were?

1558
01:29:37,455 --> 01:29:39,282
- Yeah you know after
the basketball game

1559
01:29:39,282 --> 01:29:41,803
and Sky High Records
breaking me off,

1560
01:29:41,803 --> 01:29:44,501
I'm cool on dough so
I'm gonna skedaddle.

1561
01:29:45,674 --> 01:29:47,196
- Can I have a hug?

1562
01:29:51,589 --> 01:29:56,808
♪ How can I be sure
the way I feel ♪

1563
01:29:58,808 --> 01:30:03,375
♪ If you say that you
don't know how I feel ♪

1564
01:30:03,375 --> 01:30:04,592
- Thanks Yasmine

1565
01:30:06,418 --> 01:30:09,941
for teaching me about life,

1566
01:30:09,941 --> 01:30:11,028
living,

1567
01:30:12,855 --> 01:30:13,682
myself,

1568
01:30:15,203 --> 01:30:17,161
and how to love somebody.

1569
01:30:20,074 --> 01:30:22,467
Be good to yourself shorty.

1570
01:30:35,948 --> 01:30:38,384
- I'm gonna miss you Kwame.

1571
01:30:40,993 --> 01:30:44,211
(wedding bells ringing)

1572
01:30:57,911 --> 01:31:00,911
- Oh you look beautiful Yasmine.

1573
01:31:00,911 --> 01:31:02,128
- Thanks girl.

1574
01:31:02,128 --> 01:31:04,130
- I remember when I
was in your position

1575
01:31:04,130 --> 01:31:06,348
just a few short months ago and,

1576
01:31:07,303 --> 01:31:09,349
now it's finally your turn.

1577
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:12,959
- Who knew how much drama
it would take to get here?

1578
01:31:12,959 --> 01:31:15,915
- Oh, it was the
best day of my life

1579
01:31:15,915 --> 01:31:17,263
and I hope it's all that

1580
01:31:17,263 --> 01:31:19,568
and a bucket of pigs
feet for you too, boo.

1581
01:31:21,570 --> 01:31:26,395
- Tymkia, you have
always looked out for me

1582
01:31:26,395 --> 01:31:27,787
and no matter what,

1583
01:31:27,787 --> 01:31:30,268
you have always had my
best interest in mind.

1584
01:31:31,397 --> 01:31:32,615
I love you for that.

1585
01:31:33,571 --> 01:31:34,398
- Oh, I love you too girl.

1586
01:31:55,230 --> 01:31:58,970
- Kwame, I'm surprised
to see you here, man.

1587
01:32:00,579 --> 01:32:04,276
- You know, Yasmine and I've
been friends for a long time.

1588
01:32:04,276 --> 01:32:06,886
So I had to come and represent.

1589
01:32:11,017 --> 01:32:14,235
- I'm sorry man, that
this is going down.

1590
01:32:17,104 --> 01:32:19,280
How you holding up, you cool?

1591
01:32:21,411 --> 01:32:23,020
- All right.

1592
01:32:23,020 --> 01:32:24,412
- Well keep your head up.

1593
01:32:37,632 --> 01:32:39,371
- I'm glad you
could make it Kwame.

1594
01:32:41,285 --> 01:32:45,547
And look, I just wanted
to thank you brother

1595
01:32:46,853 --> 01:32:48,897
for keeping the cobwebs
out of Yasmin's coochie

1596
01:32:48,897 --> 01:32:51,896
while she and I were
on hiatus all right?

1597
01:32:51,896 --> 01:32:54,332
(laughing)

1598
01:33:02,856 --> 01:33:04,813
- Mommy, daddy.

1599
01:33:04,813 --> 01:33:06,205
- Hey baby.

1600
01:33:11,164 --> 01:33:12,554
- Now we know we
only have 10 minutes.

1601
01:33:12,554 --> 01:33:14,904
So I'll make this brief.

1602
01:33:14,904 --> 01:33:17,903
Sweetie, destiny has
been good to you.

1603
01:33:17,903 --> 01:33:20,774
I do believe Mookie
is the one for you.

1604
01:33:20,774 --> 01:33:23,165
Y'all going to have a
beautiful life together

1605
01:33:23,165 --> 01:33:27,037
and just remember anything
you need, anything you want,

1606
01:33:27,037 --> 01:33:28,820
you just know that
your mom and daddy

1607
01:33:28,820 --> 01:33:31,298
have your love and support.

1608
01:33:31,298 --> 01:33:32,734
- Yeah baby girl.

1609
01:33:32,734 --> 01:33:34,430
- Thanks mommy and daddy.

1610
01:33:34,430 --> 01:33:37,344
- You know that lowdown
trifling ex boyfriend

1611
01:33:37,344 --> 01:33:38,517
had the nerve to
show up here today.

1612
01:33:38,517 --> 01:33:40,170
- Kwame's here?

1613
01:33:40,170 --> 01:33:41,519
- Yes he's here

1614
01:33:41,519 --> 01:33:42,867
and I don't know who in
the hell invited him.

1615
01:33:42,867 --> 01:33:44,781
- I did mommy,
we're still friends.

1616
01:33:44,781 --> 01:33:46,955
- Oh honey, you're more
of a woman than I am.

1617
01:33:46,955 --> 01:33:50,651
'Cause every time I saw his
black, I throw rocks at him.

1618
01:33:50,651 --> 01:33:53,305
Standing my baby
girl up at the altar?

1619
01:33:53,305 --> 01:33:55,392
The girl I gave life to?

1620
01:33:55,392 --> 01:33:57,870
What the hell is
wrong with him anyway?

1621
01:33:57,870 --> 01:34:01,132
- Your mother's not the only
one upset with his presence.

1622
01:34:01,132 --> 01:34:03,568
I don't know if I
can restrain myself.

1623
01:34:03,568 --> 01:34:04,959
'Cause I might just snap

1624
01:34:04,959 --> 01:34:08,614
and give him the old
fashioned beat down.

1625
01:34:08,614 --> 01:34:12,657
- Please, your little butt
ain't big as a minute.

1626
01:34:12,657 --> 01:34:14,962
You couldn't even kick your own.

1627
01:34:14,962 --> 01:34:17,136
- I can whoop your,
that much I do know.

1628
01:34:17,136 --> 01:34:19,094
- Mom, Dad, please.

1629
01:34:19,094 --> 01:34:22,748
- Now see there, you upset
Yasmine on her wedding day.

1630
01:34:22,748 --> 01:34:26,270
Look baby, I apologize for him.

1631
01:34:26,270 --> 01:34:29,445
Now I'll see you outside

1632
01:34:29,445 --> 01:34:31,924
as Mrs. Jenkins.

1633
01:34:43,274 --> 01:34:47,406
- Yas, your face lit up
like a Christmas tree

1634
01:34:47,406 --> 01:34:49,666
when you heard Kwame's name.

1635
01:34:49,666 --> 01:34:51,667
Are you sure you're
doing the right thing?

1636
01:34:51,667 --> 01:34:54,147
- Yes, this is
something I have to do.

1637
01:34:54,147 --> 01:34:57,582
- No, the only thing you have
to do is stay black and die.

1638
01:34:57,582 --> 01:35:00,017
- A woman only gets
so many proposals.

1639
01:35:00,017 --> 01:35:01,844
One has to seize the moment.

1640
01:35:01,844 --> 01:35:04,801
This could be the last
ship leaving the harbor.

1641
01:35:04,801 --> 01:35:10,020
- This may be the last boat,
but it may be the wrong boat.

1642
01:35:10,890 --> 01:35:12,107
Ask our ancestors about that.

1643
01:35:21,676 --> 01:35:22,501
- What's up dog?

1644
01:35:25,285 --> 01:35:28,459
Cassandra and me, we decided
to get back together.

1645
01:35:30,068 --> 01:35:33,723
Try to work things out,
you know what I'm saying?

1646
01:35:33,723 --> 01:35:36,635
I finally realized you know
that she the only one for me.

1647
01:35:43,116 --> 01:35:43,941
You all right?

1648
01:35:54,815 --> 01:35:58,250
(wedding march playing)

1649
01:36:34,609 --> 01:36:38,957
- Dearly beloved, we
are gathered here today

1650
01:36:38,957 --> 01:36:44,176
to baptize this brother and
sister in the name of the...

1651
01:36:50,786 --> 01:36:53,091
We are gathered here today

1652
01:36:53,091 --> 01:36:58,266
to join these two
in holy matrimony.

1653
01:36:59,527 --> 01:37:04,136
If there is anyone
who feels these two

1654
01:37:04,136 --> 01:37:06,920
should not be joined together,

1655
01:37:06,920 --> 01:37:11,574
let them speak now or
forever hold their peace.

1656
01:37:21,359 --> 01:37:25,535
Mookie Jenkins, do
you take this woman

1657
01:37:25,535 --> 01:37:30,579
to be your lawfully wedded
wife to have and to hold

1658
01:37:30,579 --> 01:37:35,798
from this day forward for as
long as you both shall live?

1659
01:37:37,407 --> 01:37:38,754
- I do.

1660
01:37:38,754 --> 01:37:43,408
- Yasmine Brooks,
do you take this man

1661
01:37:43,408 --> 01:37:46,236
to be your lawfully
wedded husband

1662
01:37:46,236 --> 01:37:50,409
to have and to hold
from this day forward,

1663
01:37:50,409 --> 01:37:54,541
for as long as you
both shall live?

1664
01:37:57,238 --> 01:37:58,803
- Yasmine, would you be my wife?

1665
01:38:02,674 --> 01:38:04,804
- Would you marry me Yasmine?

1666
01:38:12,329 --> 01:38:14,503
- What the hell are you doing?

1667
01:38:14,503 --> 01:38:19,331
- Shorty, I love you, I
am miserable without you.

1668
01:38:19,331 --> 01:38:22,637
I can't even think
half the time.

1669
01:38:22,637 --> 01:38:25,332
You are the most beautiful
woman on the planet.

1670
01:38:29,595 --> 01:38:33,335
Yas, say that you
will be my wife

1671
01:38:33,335 --> 01:38:35,335
today, right here, right now.

1672
01:38:36,901 --> 01:38:40,511
I want you, I want you
and I need you in my life

1673
01:38:40,511 --> 01:38:45,032
for richer or broker in
sickness and in health

1674
01:38:45,032 --> 01:38:48,904
'til death do us
part, Yas please.

1675
01:38:48,904 --> 01:38:50,644
- Yes Kwame, yes.

1676
01:38:52,340 --> 01:38:54,340
- Yasmine, baby.

1677
01:38:55,906 --> 01:38:58,994
I got the cash, I got
the car, I got the house.

1678
01:38:58,994 --> 01:39:02,560
What could this fool possibly
have that I ain't got?

1679
01:39:02,560 --> 01:39:03,777
- My heart.

1680
01:39:04,994 --> 01:39:05,907
- Please man.

1681
01:39:07,866 --> 01:39:11,302
- Yasmine, I love you.

1682
01:39:11,302 --> 01:39:14,170
- I'm sorry, Mookie
but I don't love you.

1683
01:39:14,170 --> 01:39:14,998
I love Kwame.

1684
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:25,566
- Look is anybody
getting married?

1685
01:39:25,566 --> 01:39:27,349
'Cause I got to be at a funeral

1686
01:39:27,349 --> 01:39:30,350
for a damned dog in 20 minutes.

1687
01:39:30,350 --> 01:39:32,047
- Yeah yeah yeah
right here homey.

1688
01:39:37,613 --> 01:39:41,874
- Dearly beloved, we are
now gathered here today

1689
01:39:41,874 --> 01:39:47,093
to unite Kwame Getman
and Yasmine Brooks
in holy matrimony.

1690
01:39:47,964 --> 01:39:50,050
If there is anyone here today

1691
01:39:50,050 --> 01:39:53,443
who feels these two
should not be together,

1692
01:39:53,443 --> 01:39:58,662
let them speak now, right now,
or forever hold their peace.

1693
01:40:07,663 --> 01:40:11,925
Yasmine Brooks, do
you take this man

1694
01:40:11,925 --> 01:40:14,882
to be your lawfully
wedded husband

1695
01:40:14,882 --> 01:40:18,927
to have and to hold
from this day forward

1696
01:40:18,927 --> 01:40:23,667
for as long as you
both shall live?

1697
01:40:25,494 --> 01:40:26,321
- I do.

1698
01:40:28,147 --> 01:40:32,800
- And Kwame Getman,
do you take this woman

1699
01:40:32,800 --> 01:40:38,019
to be your lawfully wedded
wife to have and to hold

1700
01:40:39,411 --> 01:40:43,587
from this day forward for as
long as you both shall live?

1701
01:40:55,197 --> 01:40:55,980
- I do.

1702
01:40:58,720 --> 01:41:03,156
- By the power vested in
me, I now pronounce you

1703
01:41:04,418 --> 01:41:06,071
man and wife.

1704
01:41:07,461 --> 01:41:10,593
Kwame, you may kiss the bride.

1705
01:41:17,421 --> 01:41:20,552
(guests applauding)

1706
01:41:27,641 --> 01:41:29,685
- [Yasmine] Love you boo.

1707
01:41:29,685 --> 01:41:31,685
- [Kwame] I love you too Yas.

1708
01:41:33,251 --> 01:41:35,817
(upbeat music)

1709
01:41:51,604 --> 01:41:53,952
- I still can't believe
Iggy and Cassandra

1710
01:41:53,952 --> 01:41:55,431
finally got married.

1711
01:41:55,431 --> 01:41:58,563
- Yeah who would've thunk
Iggy would ever retire?

1712
01:41:58,563 --> 01:42:00,389
- Wasn't their wedding fat?

1713
01:42:00,389 --> 01:42:02,041
- No, but Tymkia is.

1714
01:42:06,347 --> 01:42:09,434
- Don't be making
cracks about my friends.

1715
01:42:09,434 --> 01:42:11,000
I think she looks beautiful.

1716
01:42:12,306 --> 01:42:16,133
Besides I think it's time
we start making plans

1717
01:42:16,133 --> 01:42:19,133
for a little one of our own.

1718
01:42:19,133 --> 01:42:23,307
