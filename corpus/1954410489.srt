1
00:01:04,288 --> 00:01:05,232
Molly.

2
00:01:06,211 --> 00:01:07,020
Molly.

3
00:01:07,344 --> 00:01:08,312
Molly!

4
00:01:10,274 --> 00:01:11,068
Molly.

5
00:01:21,878 --> 00:01:23,622
Ahh, Molly.

6
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:29,292
Molly.

7
00:01:29,477 --> 00:01:30,287
Hay.

8
00:01:30,622 --> 00:01:31,796
There you are.

9
00:01:33,045 --> 00:01:34,144
Where were you?

10
00:01:34,145 --> 00:01:35,010
Bad dog!

11
00:01:38,288 --> 00:01:40,454
All right, this is it.

12
00:01:50,655 --> 00:01:53,290
Don't worry, this is just in case
something goes terribly wrong.

13
00:02:54,887 --> 00:02:56,867
I'm actually coming over.
I'll just talk to you...

14
00:02:56,868 --> 00:02:58,231
<i>No, no.  Listen to me</i>

15
00:02:58,232 --> 00:02:59,730
<i>- You have to stop me!</i>
- I'm hanging up now.

16
00:03:00,229 --> 00:03:01,166
<i>No!</i>

17
00:03:29,570 --> 00:03:30,673
Molly?

18
00:03:31,327 --> 00:03:32,303
Molly.

19
00:03:33,253 --> 00:03:34,936
- Molly?
- She's on the couch.

20
00:03:34,937 --> 00:03:36,861
What?  James!

21
00:03:37,116 --> 00:03:38,243
What are you doing here?

22
00:03:38,244 --> 00:03:40,531
What was that crazy phone
call about Howard?

23
00:03:41,446 --> 00:03:42,271
What?

24
00:03:43,374 --> 00:03:46,750
Your call, you were screening about
stopping you from doing something.

25
00:03:46,751 --> 00:03:48,713
Listen, I don't know what
you're talking about.

26
00:03:48,777 --> 00:03:51,666
But you have to leave, I'm working
on something extremely important.

27
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:53,830
This your new invention to show the board?

28
00:03:54,645 --> 00:03:55,668
That's right.

29
00:03:56,574 --> 00:03:57,749
Oh, it's cute.

30
00:03:58,389 --> 00:03:59,428
They would have liked it.

31
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,153
What do you mean?

32
00:04:02,205 --> 00:04:04,236
They've already selected mine to be funded.

33
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:07,319
What?

34
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,528
It's over.

35
00:04:09,266 --> 00:04:12,686
Sorry champ, you're finished.

36
00:04:12,941 --> 00:04:16,076
No, no!  No not yet.

37
00:04:17,102 --> 00:04:19,229
I'm sorry Howard, but what's done is done.

38
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:20,446
You can't change it.

39
00:04:20,512 --> 00:04:22,036
That's what you think.

40
00:04:22,785 --> 00:04:23,833
Were you doing?

41
00:04:23,864 --> 00:04:25,436
I know what you've been working on

42
00:04:25,437 --> 00:04:26,861
but it's irrelevant now

43
00:04:26,862 --> 00:04:30,048
because my invention is going
to blow yours of the water

44
00:04:30,049 --> 00:04:31,161
and I'm about to prove it.

45
00:04:32,073 --> 00:04:33,430
Are you going somewhere?

46
00:04:33,496 --> 00:04:36,107
Yeah, see you soon old friend.

47
00:04:36,302 --> 00:04:38,722
The time is 12:04 PM.

48
00:04:39,559 --> 00:04:40,963
and I embark.

49
00:05:06,289 --> 00:05:07,376
Ahh.

50
00:05:16,012 --> 00:05:16,671
Uh!

51
00:05:19,253 --> 00:05:20,190
Hello?

52
00:05:20,622 --> 00:05:21,701
<i>Hello.</i>

53
00:05:23,739 --> 00:05:26,477
You! What is the time?
What is the exact time?

54
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:30,142
Ahhh!

55
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:33,019
Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god.

56
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,592
It works.

57
00:05:38,092 --> 00:05:39,108
July 1.

58
00:05:42,484 --> 00:05:43,913
11:59 AM

59
00:05:44,189 --> 00:05:45,642
This is 5 minutes in the past.

60
00:05:45,755 --> 00:05:46,882
Oh, it's perfect.

61
00:05:48,255 --> 00:05:49,574
Why am I not in the garage?

62
00:05:49,575 --> 00:05:50,757
What am I doing here?

63
00:05:58,875 --> 00:05:59,796
No!

64
00:06:00,231 --> 00:06:03,009
That makes sense... The
rotation of the earth.

65
00:06:03,129 --> 00:06:05,653
I'd travels through time not space.

66
00:06:07,825 --> 00:06:11,262
I did it!  I'm the world's
first time traveler.

67
00:06:11,263 --> 00:06:13,615
<i>911 please state your emergency.</i>

68
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:17,120
You'll have to excuse me Miss.
I have some gloating to do.

69
00:06:17,351 --> 00:06:20,097
<i>Hello?  Hello is someone there?</i>

70
00:06:20,466 --> 00:06:21,633
This is my neighborhood!

71
00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:24,110
<i>Hello?</i>

72
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:44,680
Ha!

73
00:06:55,045 --> 00:06:56,109
What happened?

74
00:06:58,769 --> 00:06:59,888
What did you do?

75
00:06:59,889 --> 00:07:01,317
I didn't do anything.

76
00:07:01,439 --> 00:07:03,812
You disappeared two more of you burst in

77
00:07:03,813 --> 00:07:05,587
one of you shot the other one

78
00:07:05,588 --> 00:07:07,674
then you jumped in the box
and disappeared again.

79
00:07:08,244 --> 00:07:10,411
Wait, I killed myself?

80
00:07:11,602 --> 00:07:12,514
Yes.

81
00:07:13,088 --> 00:07:15,501
Oh god, no no no.

82
00:07:15,502 --> 00:07:17,439
The moment I got into the machine

83
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,924
I must've started a chain reaction...

84
00:07:18,925 --> 00:07:22,042
Howard this is incredible! You've
created a working time machine!

85
00:07:22,043 --> 00:07:23,977
No, no no no.  I have to turn it off.

86
00:07:24,146 --> 00:07:26,091
I-I-I I have to destroy it

87
00:07:26,502 --> 00:07:28,082
- Howard, stop!
- What!

88
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:29,566
You can't do that.

89
00:07:29,921 --> 00:07:31,850
This machine is revolutionary.

90
00:07:32,357 --> 00:07:34,388
It's better than anything
I could ever create

91
00:07:35,106 --> 00:07:37,653
You can use it.  To save yourself.

92
00:07:38,252 --> 00:07:39,871
Oh you mean, go back again.

93
00:07:39,893 --> 00:07:42,663
And stop herself from ever killing
yourself in the first place.

94
00:07:42,796 --> 00:07:44,772
None of this has to happen.
You can change it.

95
00:07:45,053 --> 00:07:46,807
You know, maybe you're right.
I can fix this.

96
00:07:46,808 --> 00:07:48,500
- What time is it?
- Twel...

97
00:07:48,501 --> 00:07:49,909
12:07

98
00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:51,555
I got in at 12:04

99
00:07:52,656 --> 00:07:53,965
I may just have enough time.

100
00:07:54,901 --> 00:07:55,750
OK.

101
00:07:56,101 --> 00:07:57,283
- Thanks James.
- You're welcome.

102
00:08:01,432 --> 00:08:02,495
Wish me luck.

103
00:08:02,757 --> 00:08:03,837
Good luck.

104
00:08:21,215 --> 00:08:22,755
Oh my god are you OK?

105
00:08:23,665 --> 00:08:24,779
What time is it?

106
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:25,565
Huh?

107
00:08:25,566 --> 00:08:27,042
I need to know the exact time.

108
00:08:27,565 --> 00:08:28,525
Quickly.

109
00:08:28,526 --> 00:08:30,007
It's, 12:02.

110
00:08:31,941 --> 00:08:34,322
OK, 5 minutes again.

111
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:36,266
I only have a couple of
minutes to get back.

112
00:08:36,464 --> 00:08:37,679
What are you doing?

113
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:39,110
No time to explain.  I've got to go.

114
00:08:49,343 --> 00:08:50,051
Close.

115
00:08:50,201 --> 00:08:51,432
I can make it!

116
00:08:56,743 --> 00:08:58,394
Unless I'm the one to get shot.

117
00:09:02,528 --> 00:09:04,139
What if I'm the one to get shot!?!

118
00:09:04,505 --> 00:09:05,711
?

119
00:09:08,083 --> 00:09:09,956
Jeff, am I the one that gets shot?

120
00:09:12,607 --> 00:09:14,271
No!  Don't kill me!

121
00:09:14,272 --> 00:09:15,764
I'm such an idiot.

122
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,565
No-no-no-no-no-no-no.

123
00:09:23,566 --> 00:09:25,022
What is going on?

124
00:09:25,023 --> 00:09:26,830
I have to stop myself from starting this.

125
00:09:26,831 --> 00:09:28,590
From ever time traveling at all.

126
00:09:28,886 --> 00:09:31,585
Time traveling?  Howard, what's happening?

127
00:09:32,193 --> 00:09:33,361
There's no time!

128
00:09:33,362 --> 00:09:34,746
Howard stop!

129
00:09:35,069 --> 00:09:38,188
I was lying. I didn't get the grant.
This letter is fake.

130
00:09:38,189 --> 00:09:39,469
I came here because...

131
00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:42,307
Well, it doesn't matter. I have to
go back and fix this, remember?

132
00:09:42,308 --> 00:09:44,149
What are you talking about?

133
00:09:45,071 --> 00:09:46,714
I'll do better this time.

134
00:09:47,877 --> 00:09:49,131
I can change what happened.

135
00:10:16,789 --> 00:10:18,844
<i>Hi, this is Howard, leave me a message.</i>

136
00:10:19,210 --> 00:10:20,471
GodDamnIt, pick up!

137
00:10:26,658 --> 00:10:28,762
<i>- Howard?</i>
- Jim!  Jim.

138
00:10:28,763 --> 00:10:31,148
You have to stop me... from
doing what I'm about to do.

139
00:10:31,956 --> 00:10:33,035
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

140
00:10:34,551 --> 00:10:35,448
Howard?

141
00:10:36,098 --> 00:10:37,130
Damn it!

142
00:10:38,130 --> 00:10:39,265
<i>Howard?</i>

143
00:10:39,698 --> 00:10:40,944
<i>Hello?</i>

144
00:10:42,608 --> 00:10:44,650
<i>Yeah, I'm actually coming over.
I'll just...</i>

145
00:10:44,651 --> 00:10:45,825
No no listened.

146
00:10:45,826 --> 00:10:47,665
- You have to stop me from...  Jim!
- <i>I'm hanging up now.</i>

147
00:10:47,894 --> 00:10:49,109
No!

148
00:10:51,215 --> 00:10:53,056
Well, there's still time.

149
00:10:59,373 --> 00:11:00,595
No!

150
00:11:13,021 --> 00:11:14,902
No!  Don't kill me!

151
00:11:14,903 --> 00:11:16,312
I'm such an idiot!

152
00:11:23,812 --> 00:11:25,574
No-no-no-no-no-no-no.

153
00:11:25,575 --> 00:11:27,114
What is going on?

154
00:11:27,155 --> 00:11:29,083
I have to stop myself from starting this.

155
00:11:29,117 --> 00:11:30,863
From ever time traveling at all.

156
00:11:30,966 --> 00:11:33,657
Time traveling?  Howard what's happening?

157
00:11:34,191 --> 00:11:35,437
No there's no time.

158
00:11:35,499 --> 00:11:37,015
Howard stop.

159
00:11:37,472 --> 00:11:38,520
I was lying,

160
00:11:38,530 --> 00:11:40,839
I didn't get the grant.
This letter is fake.

161
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:41,813
I came here because...

162
00:11:41,814 --> 00:11:42,519
Well, it doesn't matter.

163
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:44,400
I have to go back and fix this, remember?

164
00:11:44,401 --> 00:11:46,085
What are you talking about?

165
00:11:47,725 --> 00:11:49,233
I'll do better this time.

166
00:11:50,321 --> 00:11:51,623
I can change what happened.

167
00:13:06,818 --> 00:13:07,984
Can't leave yet.

168
00:13:08,565 --> 00:13:09,470
OK?

169
00:13:09,471 --> 00:13:11,392
We have to put this thing back in.  C'mon.

170
00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:28,099
What is happening?

171
00:13:28,319 --> 00:13:30,882
Howard will be here soon,
and when he gets here

172
00:13:31,265 --> 00:13:32,757
he'll know you stole this.

173
00:13:32,855 --> 00:13:34,387
Howard's dead.

174
00:13:34,641 --> 00:13:36,744
No he's not.

175
00:13:37,402 --> 00:13:38,410
Not yet.

176
00:13:42,281 --> 00:13:43,591
There's still one more.

177
00:13:45,495 --> 00:13:46,988
Quick, over hear.

178
00:13:49,169 --> 00:13:50,304
Get down.  Hide.

179
00:13:51,528 --> 00:13:52,806
Listen carefully.

180
00:13:53,171 --> 00:13:56,433
You have to do this exactly the
same way, if this is going to work.

181
00:13:57,592 --> 00:13:58,846
Gimme that.

182
00:14:17,674 --> 00:14:18,373
Ha!

183
00:14:22,804 --> 00:14:24,154
What happened?

184
00:14:24,229 --> 00:14:25,491
What did you do?

185
00:14:25,492 --> 00:14:26,815
I didn't do anything.

186
00:14:26,882 --> 00:14:29,390
You disappeared two more of you burst in

187
00:14:29,391 --> 00:14:30,955
one of you shot the other one

188
00:14:31,081 --> 00:14:33,073
then you jumped in the box
and disappeared again.

189
00:14:33,558 --> 00:14:34,407
Wait,

190
00:14:35,093 --> 00:14:36,315
I killed myself?

191
00:14:36,993 --> 00:14:37,898
Yes.

192
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:40,009
Oh god!

193
00:14:40,510 --> 00:14:41,272
No-no-no

194
00:14:41,273 --> 00:14:42,987
The moment that I got into the machine

195
00:14:42,988 --> 00:14:44,404
I must have started a chain of events...

196
00:14:44,411 --> 00:14:47,617
Howard this is incredible, you've
created a working time machine.

197
00:14:47,618 --> 00:14:48,429
No, no no no

198
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:49,517
I have to turn it off.

199
00:14:49,642 --> 00:14:51,515
I-I-I-I have to destroy it

200
00:14:51,516 --> 00:14:52,222
I have to...

201
00:14:52,223 --> 00:14:53,826
- Howard stop!
- What!

202
00:14:53,827 --> 00:14:54,938
You can't do that.

203
00:14:55,253 --> 00:14:57,507
This machine is revolutionary.

204
00:14:57,716 --> 00:14:59,827
It's better than anything
I could ever create

205
00:15:00,585 --> 00:15:03,017
You can use it, to save yourself.

206
00:15:03,657 --> 00:15:05,554
Oh, you mean go back again.

207
00:15:05,656 --> 00:15:08,204
And stop yourself from ever killing
yourself in the first place.

208
00:15:08,205 --> 00:15:10,586
None of this has to happen.
You can change it.

209
00:15:10,587 --> 00:15:12,285
You know, maybe you're right.
I can fix this.

210
00:15:12,617 --> 00:15:14,038
- What time is it?
- Twel...

211
00:15:14,218 --> 00:15:15,385
12:07

212
00:15:15,544 --> 00:15:17,266
And I got in at 12:04

213
00:15:17,869 --> 00:15:19,290
I may just have enough time.

214
00:15:20,307 --> 00:15:21,315
OK.

215
00:15:21,676 --> 00:15:23,271
- Thanks James.
- You're welcome.

216
00:15:26,889 --> 00:15:28,326
Wish me luck.

217
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,574
Good luck.

218
00:15:38,826 --> 00:15:41,802
OK.  Do you understand what's going on?

219
00:15:42,462 --> 00:15:44,137
You know what you have to do?

220
00:15:44,865 --> 00:15:46,111
Yes.

221
00:15:47,238 --> 00:15:48,547
Get in there.

222
00:15:56,623 --> 00:15:58,433
You sure this is going to work?

223
00:15:59,502 --> 00:16:00,811
It already has.

224
00:16:42,659 --> 00:16:43,977
Perfect.
