that's Lou Reed.

731
00:43:02,714 --> 00:43:04,794
We have to interview him.
Yeah.

732
00:43:08,852 --> 00:43:10,520
Hi, Lou.

733
00:43:10,522 --> 00:43:12,188
Um, we would like
to interview you

734
00:43:12,190 --> 00:43:15,191
<i>for the first issue
of Pun magazine.</i>

735
00:43:15,193 --> 00:43:19,062
We'd like to put you
on the cover.

736
00:43:19,064 --> 00:43:22,098
Cover of the first issue.

737
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:27,003
If you agree
to do an interview.

738
00:43:27,005 --> 00:43:30,773
Your circulation
must be enormous.

739
00:43:30,775 --> 00:43:33,276
Do you like Patti Smith?

740
00:43:33,278 --> 00:43:37,747
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, yeah.

741
00:43:37,749 --> 00:43:40,216
What about Bruce Springsteen?

742
00:43:40,218 --> 00:43:41,851
Oh, I love him.

743
00:43:41,853 --> 00:43:43,219
Y- you do?

744
00:43:43,221 --> 00:43:44,921
Oh, yeah.
He's one of us.

745
00:43:44,923 --> 00:43:47,924
Thank you.

746
00:43:47,926 --> 00:43:49,926
He's a shit.

747
00:43:49,928 --> 00:43:52,261
What are you talking about?

748
00:43:52,263 --> 00:43:54,530
What kind of stupid
question is that?

749
00:43:54,532 --> 00:43:57,734
Okay- do I ask you
what you like?

750
00:43:57,736 --> 00:43:59,435
Who gives a fuck what I like?

751
00:43:59,437 --> 00:44:01,204
I don't even
give a fuck what I like.

752
00:44:01,206 --> 00:44:03,272
Well, you're a rock star, man.

753
00:44:03,274 --> 00:44:07,710
Oh, yeah.
I keep forgetting.

754
00:44:07,712 --> 00:44:12,181
Sontag called it the sensibility
of failed seriousness.

755
00:44:24,995 --> 00:44:26,963
What's their name?

756
00:44:26,965 --> 00:44:30,166
The Ramones.

757
00:44:30,168 --> 00:44:33,736
Look like they were raised
under police lamps.

758
00:44:38,809 --> 00:44:42,129
[Hilly] What do you
guys have for me?

759
00:44:44,982 --> 00:44:47,650
We got four songs:

760
00:44:47,652 --> 00:44:50,186
<i>I don't wanna
walk around with you,</i>

761
00:44:50,188 --> 00:44:51,621
<i>I don't wanna be learned,</i>

762
00:44:51,623 --> 00:44:53,356
<i>I don't wanna be tamed,</i>

763
00:44:53,358 --> 00:44:57,727
<i>and I don't wanna go
down to the basement.</i>

764
00:44:57,729 --> 00:44:59,195
Lot of things
you don't wanna do.

765
00:44:59,197 --> 00:45:00,596
Yeah.

766
00:45:00,598 --> 00:45:03,299
Anything you wanna do?

767
00:45:03,301 --> 00:45:06,202
We're working on something now.

768
00:45:06,204 --> 00:45:08,071
Something positive?

769
00:45:08,073 --> 00:45:13,009
<i>Yeah. It's-it's called
I wanna sniff some glue.</i>

770
00:45:13,011 --> 00:45:15,945
Good to have a point of view.

771
00:45:19,149 --> 00:45:21,184
One, two, three, four!

772
00:45:21,186 --> 00:45:23,119
[Dischordant music]

773
00:45:26,790 --> 00:45:28,057
What the fuck are you playing?

774
00:45:28,059 --> 00:45:31,794
Ah, fuck!

775
00:45:31,796 --> 00:45:35,364
You guys wanna try it again?
Yeah.

776
00:45:35,366 --> 00:45:37,533
Is Johnny coming back?
[Glass breaks]

777
00:45:37,535 --> 00:45:39,202
What are we playing?
Johnny!

778
00:45:39,204 --> 00:45:41,104
Johnny?

779
00:45:41,106 --> 00:45:44,407
[Johnny] Fuck!

780
00:45:44,409 --> 00:45:45,641
Lively!

781
00:45:45,643 --> 00:45:46,909
One, two, three, four!

Sittin' in a hospital bed

783
00:45:50,682 --> 00:45:54,350
Sittin' in a hospital bed

784
00:45:54,352 --> 00:45:58,254
sittin' in a hospital bed

785
00:45:58,256 --> 00:46:01,791
I- I want life

786
00:46:01,793 --> 00:46:05,461
I want my life

787
00:46:05,463 --> 00:46:08,631
I want my life

788
00:46:08,633 --> 00:46:13,136
I got knocked down,
but I'll get up

789
00:46:21,812 --> 00:46:25,148
Nobody is gonna like you guys.

790
00:46:30,020 --> 00:46:32,789
But I'll have you back.

791
00:46:40,664 --> 00:46:44,167
The city's going bankrupt.

792
00:46:44,169 --> 00:46:46,435
It's like a disease.

793
00:46:46,437 --> 00:46:49,372
Which I would prefer
not to catch.

794
00:46:49,374 --> 00:46:51,374
Meaning?

795
00:46:51,376 --> 00:46:54,343
We have to get
our affairs in order.

796
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:58,681
I'm working on it.

797
00:46:58,683 --> 00:47:01,818
Your working
isn't working, hilly.

798
00:47:05,989 --> 00:47:07,390
[Hilly] Coming to you

799
00:47:07,392 --> 00:47:10,960
from the bowery
of New York City,

Wayne county.

801
00:47:15,332 --> 00:47:17,834
Hello, sex kittens!

802
00:47:17,836 --> 00:47:19,702
Eat my pussy!

803
00:47:19,704 --> 00:47:22,171
Wish I had one.
Oh!

804

[Cheers, whistling]

805
00:47:23,641 --> 00:47:25,141
Here we go!
Here we go.

806

Ready, ready, ready,
ready, ready!

807
00:47:27,145 --> 00:47:31,414
One, two, three, I'Chaim!

808
00:47:31,416 --> 00:47:33,950
Wanted nothing more

809
00:47:33,952 --> 00:47:37,286
I know you wouldn't go...

810
00:47:37,288 --> 00:47:38,955
No, no, no, no, no!

811
00:47:38,957 --> 00:47:41,924
C'mere.

812
00:47:41,926 --> 00:47:44,160
I'm Nicky Gant!

813
00:47:44,162 --> 00:47:45,695
Nicky fuckin' Gant!

814
00:47:45,697 --> 00:47:46,963
I produce records!

815
00:47:46,965 --> 00:47:49,432
Hilly told me
this was on the house!

816
00:47:49,434 --> 00:47:52,134
No money.

817
00:47:52,136 --> 00:47:53,836
We cool?

818
00:47:53,838 --> 00:47:55,471
You were a marksman

819
00:47:55,473 --> 00:47:57,974
told me that law,
like wine, is ageless

820
00:47:57,976 --> 00:48:00,576
You got any-any chips
or something?

821
00:48:06,617 --> 00:48:10,052
Gonna have to do something
about that stage.

822
00:48:12,923 --> 00:48:14,690
Well, you might want
to think about having fewer

823
00:48:14,692 --> 00:48:16,425
"guests of hilly"
and more paying customers

824
00:48:16,427 --> 00:48:17,660
if you want to pay for it.

825
00:48:17,662 --> 00:48:18,995
I'm with Lisa on this one.

826
00:48:18,997 --> 00:48:21,330
You gotta spend money
to make money.

827
00:48:21,332 --> 00:48:23,933
You gotta have money
to spend money to make money.

828
00:48:23,935 --> 00:48:25,201
And since you spend
all the money you make,

829
00:48:25,203 --> 00:48:26,502
you don't have
any money to spend.

830
00:48:26,504 --> 00:48:27,737
So you might want to think

831
00:48:27,739 --> 00:48:29,005
about saving the money you make

832
00:48:29,007 --> 00:48:31,207
instead of spending
the money you make!

833
00:48:34,311 --> 00:48:36,913
All right. We're gonna
try that one again.

834
00:48:36,915 --> 00:48:39,515
[Audience cheering]

835
00:48:47,257 --> 00:48:49,926
What are you doing?

836
00:48:49,928 --> 00:48:51,560
Damn it, dad.

837
00:48:51,562 --> 00:48:53,162
What, two bankruptcies
wasn't enough for you?

838
00:48:53,164 --> 00:48:54,830
Why not go for three?
Stop.

839
00:48:54,832 --> 00:48:56,332
No, I'm taking over
the finances.

840
00:48:56,334 --> 00:48:57,867
No, you're not.
You're fired.

841
00:48:57,869 --> 00:49:00,102
You're firing me?

842
00:49:00,104 --> 00:49:03,673
Yeah.
Get the hell out.

843
00:49:03,675 --> 00:49:07,276
I want my life

844
00:49:07,278 --> 00:49:10,513
I want my life

845
00:49:12,649 --> 00:49:16,852
things are not
gonna work out with her.

846
00:49:16,854 --> 00:49:18,921
Everything all right, hilly?

847
00:49:18,923 --> 00:49:20,723
[Man] Hey, so, Debbie,

848
00:49:20,725 --> 00:49:23,526
who were the people you,
you know, idolized as an artist?

849
00:49:23,528 --> 00:49:26,095
Fuck, you know, I always
really liked Brigitte Bardot.

850
00:49:26,097 --> 00:49:28,130
Uh-huh.

851
00:49:28,132 --> 00:49:30,333
I thought she was sort of a
continental punk, you knowYeah.

852
00:49:30,335 --> 00:49:33,669
I always thought sex
was a cool thing to sell.

853
00:49:33,671 --> 00:49:35,304
A sure thing.

854
00:49:35,306 --> 00:49:38,674
I wish I'd invented sex.

855
00:49:38,676 --> 00:49:40,543
You like sex?

856
00:49:45,615 --> 00:49:47,883
God, look at this!

857
00:49:47,885 --> 00:49:49,986
I'm sick of the goddamn fleas
from hilly's dog.

858
00:49:49,988 --> 00:49:52,121
Have you considered boots?

859
00:49:52,123 --> 00:49:54,623
Boots?

860
00:50:03,266 --> 00:50:05,501
Can I describe
what it's like

861
00:50:05,503 --> 00:50:10,506
To have sex
with the light on?

862
00:50:10,508 --> 00:50:12,608
And would you feel right

863
00:50:12,610 --> 00:50:16,479
if I did you tonight
and put the bite on?

Look out!

884
00:51:25,083 --> 00:51:28,284
Don't tell me.
"There's something there."

885
00:51:30,654 --> 00:51:34,590
There is definitely
something there.

886
00:51:34,592 --> 00:51:37,460
The dead boys.

887
00:51:37,462 --> 00:51:40,629
As long as they don't
take their name too seriously.

888

890
00:51:51,943 --> 00:51:55,377
That was good.
It was really good.

891

Thank you, sir.
That means a lot, you know?

892
00:51:57,515 --> 00:52:00,216
Your dog is crapping
on the floor, sir.

893
00:52:00,218 --> 00:52:02,718
Yeah, he does that.

894
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:04,587
I piss in ice machines.

895
00:52:04,589 --> 00:52:06,388
Where you guys from?

896
00:52:06,390 --> 00:52:07,857
Cleveland, sir.

897
00:52:07,859 --> 00:52:11,093
Well, I'm impressed
with the youth of Cleveland.

898
00:52:11,095 --> 00:52:13,095
Oh, you shouldn't be.
Why not?

899
00:52:13,097 --> 00:52:15,197
Lotta losers.

900
00:52:15,199 --> 00:52:19,268
Well, you seem awfully polite.

901
00:52:19,270 --> 00:52:21,804
Yeah, well, we were altar boys.

902
00:52:21,806 --> 00:52:23,606
That was a while ago.

903

Look, Mr. Kristal,
do we get the gig here or not?

904
00:52:25,610 --> 00:52:27,309
Yeah.
No shit!

905
00:52:27,311 --> 00:52:28,744
Holy fuck.

906
00:52:28,746 --> 00:52:31,313
Spoken like a true altar boy.

907
00:52:43,660 --> 00:52:46,595
[Woman] Some say punk promotes
a message of violence.

908
00:52:46,597 --> 00:52:49,665
I mean, what we're doing is not
really destructive, you know?

909
00:52:49,667 --> 00:52:53,002
So it's not a statement
of aggression?

910
00:52:53,004 --> 00:52:57,206
We're just letting out
a little energy and frustration.

911
00:52:57,208 --> 00:52:58,741
And where better to do that?

912
00:52:58,743 --> 00:53:00,709
Here or on the streets?

913
00:53:00,711 --> 00:53:03,145
Good point.
Hi, mom!

914
00:53:03,147 --> 00:53:05,814
Uh, yeah.

915
00:53:05,816 --> 00:53:07,383
It's actually really healthy.

916
00:53:07,385 --> 00:53:09,652
So what kind of girls
do you like?

917
00:53:09,654 --> 00:53:11,654
All kinds.

918
00:53:15,559 --> 00:53:17,493
I like the ones that like to
fuck and leave in the morning.

919
00:53:17,495 --> 00:53:21,163
Stiv, she just wants
to give you a blowjob.

920
00:53:23,166 --> 00:53:26,068
Cut.

921
00:53:26,070 --> 00:53:29,939
I dare you.

922
00:53:29,941 --> 00:53:32,741
You know better
than to dare me.

923
00:53:45,188 --> 00:53:47,923
Hot flashes
burning my brain

924
00:53:47,925 --> 00:53:49,925
Your tongue lashes
drive me insane

925
00:53:49,927 --> 00:53:52,828
From New York City to LA

926
00:53:52,830 --> 00:53:55,164
You're known
as the hottest lay

927
00:53:55,166 --> 00:53:57,866
And ya pink canopy
gonna shackle ya down

928
00:53:57,868 --> 00:54:00,402
You crossed
every back in town

929
00:54:00,404 --> 00:54:03,239
From a cherry runaway
to a bowery queen

930
00:54:03,241 --> 00:54:05,874
Used up before
your sweet sixteen

931
00:54:05,876 --> 00:54:07,576
Everyone knows
you were caught

932
00:54:07,578 --> 00:54:10,379
With the meat in your mouth

933
00:54:10,381 --> 00:54:12,281
Said everyone knows

934
00:54:12,283 --> 00:54:15,484
you been caught with
the meat in your mouth

935
00:54:24,361 --> 00:54:26,395
Whoo!

936
00:54:26,397 --> 00:54:28,731
Look for love
on a one-way street

937
00:54:28,733 --> 00:54:31,734
Bedding down with every-

938
00:54:31,736 --> 00:54:33,969
a- stripping and a-dancing
and a-buying some downs

939
00:54:33,971 --> 00:54:36,805
See?
It's not all about violence!

940
00:54:36,807 --> 00:54:39,975
Cut! Cut!

941
00:54:42,279 --> 00:54:44,146
Yeah, stiv!

942
00:54:44,148 --> 00:54:46,108
Gettin' his dick sucked.
Oh, shit.

943
00:55:04,601 --> 00:55:06,568
Fresca.

944
00:55:06,570 --> 00:55:09,438
On the house.

945
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:11,573
Stan.

946
00:55:14,344 --> 00:55:17,913
You know I got nothing
against you, right?

947
00:55:17,915 --> 00:55:19,415
I like to think anyone

948
00:55:19,417 --> 00:55:24,053
who shares a drink in my club
is my friend.

949
00:55:24,055 --> 00:55:27,690
Well, as your friend,

950
00:55:27,692 --> 00:55:29,224
we've had some complaints.

951
00:55:30,660 --> 00:55:33,929
About what?

952
00:55:33,931 --> 00:55:36,598
Hey, hilly.

953
00:55:41,304 --> 00:55:43,806
Uh, excuse me.

954
00:55:46,476 --> 00:55:50,412
Now, I'm just
the messenger here, all right?

955
00:55:50,414 --> 00:55:52,414
But I understand the complaints

956
00:55:52,416 --> 00:55:54,383
are about the...

957
00:55:54,385 --> 00:55:58,487
Element your club attracts.

958
00:55:58,489 --> 00:55:59,988
Are you kidding me?

959
00:55:59,990 --> 00:56:03,592
If anything,
I'm cleaning the street up.

960
00:56:03,594 --> 00:56:06,261
I am just the messenger here.

961
00:56:06,263 --> 00:56:07,796
I mean,
people bigger than you and I

962
00:56:07,798 --> 00:56:12,601
are tugging the strings
and stirring the shit.

963
00:56:12,603 --> 00:56:14,470
And I also understand

964
00:56:14,472 --> 00:56:18,807
that you're three months
behind on your rent.

965
00:56:18,809 --> 00:56:21,577
Now that kind of thing
just doesn't help.

966
00:56:21,579 --> 00:56:24,113
Pay your bills, Kristal.

967
00:56:24,115 --> 00:56:26,582
Pay your fuckin' bills.

968
00:56:45,902 --> 00:56:48,904
I don't like that guy.

969
00:56:56,079 --> 00:56:58,247
I got a spirit in my house

970
00:56:58,249 --> 00:56:59,481
and I know
it ain't no...

971
00:56:59,483 --> 00:57:01,016
I know you got more junk, man.

972
00:57:01,018 --> 00:57:02,484
Come on.
Give me the fuckin' drug.

973
00:57:02,486 --> 00:57:04,087
Come on, Idaho.
Give me the fuckin' drug.

974
00:57:09,959 --> 00:57:13,429
Not in... my club!

975
00:57:19,169 --> 00:57:23,038
[Idaho] Come on, hilly.
Be cool, man.

976
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:24,807
Like I was saying
previously, Stan,

977
00:57:24,809 --> 00:57:26,575
these two gentlemen

978
00:57:26,577 --> 00:57:29,978
were not abiding by
the rigorous code of ethics

979
00:57:29,980 --> 00:57:34,249
I strive to maintain
in my establishment.

980
00:57:37,420 --> 00:57:41,590
Well, that's not very
good, now, is it, boys?

981
00:57:41,592 --> 00:57:44,059
In my house, in my house

982
00:57:46,996 --> 00:57:48,464
What are we stopping for?

983
00:57:48,466 --> 00:57:50,265
Joey fell off the stage, John.

984
00:57:50,267 --> 00:57:52,234
Fuckin' think
I didn't fuckin' notice?!

985
00:57:52,236 --> 00:57:54,570
Ah, fuck!

986
00:57:57,875 --> 00:58:02,578
I know a girl
from a lonely street

987
00:58:02,580 --> 00:58:05,814
Cold as ice cream
but still as sweet

988
00:58:05,816 --> 00:58:10,786
Dry your eyes Sunday girl

989
00:58:10,788 --> 00:58:13,555
Hey I saw your guy

990
00:58:13,557 --> 00:58:15,991
with a different girl

991
00:58:15,993 --> 00:58:19,628
looks like he's
in another world

992
00:58:19,630 --> 00:58:21,430
Run and hide Sunday girl

994

Hey, all you wannabes,
I'm fuckin' Iggy pop!

995
00:58:26,470 --> 00:58:29,905
Let's play
some real fuckin' music!

996
00:58:29,907 --> 00:58:32,441
"I wanna be your dog."
Fuck you, Iggy!

997
00:58:32,443 --> 00:58:34,510
One, two, three, four!

998
00:58:57,667 --> 00:58:59,768
So messed up

999
00:58:59,770 --> 00:59:01,737
I want you here

in my room

1001
00:59:07,645 --> 00:59:09,945
I want you here

1002
00:59:13,783 --> 00:59:16,218
now we're gonna be

1003
00:59:16,220 --> 00:59:18,053
face to face

1004
00:59:21,424 --> 00:59:23,692
and I'll lay right down

1005
00:59:23,694 --> 00:59:25,861
in my favorite place

1006
00:59:30,099 --> 00:59:32,000
now I wanna

1007
00:59:32,002 --> 00:59:33,869
be your dog

1008

now I wanna

fuck the bogus claims.

1013
00:59:47,585 --> 00:59:49,284
I'm the pioneer of punk.

1014

Stage dive.
I was the first.

1015
00:59:57,460 --> 01:00:01,496
See the bands are not political,
but their disavowing of politics

1016
01:00:01,498 --> 01:00:03,765
in and of itself,
it is political.

1017
01:00:03,767 --> 01:00:06,268
I belong to the blank
generation.

1018
01:00:08,571 --> 01:00:11,306
And relevant!
And timely!

1019
01:00:11,308 --> 01:00:15,410
John, hilly is a modern-day
salonist!

1020
01:00:15,412 --> 01:00:17,846
Like a drug I never did before.

1021
01:00:17,848 --> 01:00:19,181
Ooh, no no no, I like that!

1022
01:00:19,183 --> 01:00:20,549

01:00:33,864 --> 01:00:35,998

"you have to listen
to hear."

then dictators.

1037
01:01:20,643 --> 01:01:22,144
You scare them.

1038
01:01:22,146 --> 01:01:24,746
Yeah, probably.

1039
01:01:29,452 --> 01:01:31,920
This place is starting
to happen.

1040
01:01:33,389 --> 01:01:34,756
It's still shit-ass music,

1041
01:01:34,758 --> 01:01:36,558
you ask me.

1042
01:01:36,560 --> 01:01:38,427
It's not the Grand Ole Opry.

1043
01:01:38,429 --> 01:01:41,697
It's hard to get Conway Twitty
down to the bowery.

1044
01:01:43,599 --> 01:01:46,068
One day.

1045
01:01:46,070 --> 01:01:49,771
Maybe me and the boys'll
hang back till then.

1046
01:01:49,773 --> 01:01:51,273
Stop scaring the kids.

1047
01:01:51,275 --> 01:01:55,210
Let you grow
this place into a, uh,

1048
01:01:55,212 --> 01:01:57,079
something.

1049
01:01:57,081 --> 01:02:01,283
Then when you're famous,
and old Twitty shows up,

1050
01:02:01,285 --> 01:02:04,820
I'll be back and I'm
bringing all my friends.

Don't forget, we're
right down the block.

1053
01:02:14,732 --> 01:02:17,365
Thanks, Leslie.

1054
01:02:17,367 --> 01:02:21,770
Nobody calls me that.

Except my grandma.

01:02:24,808 --> 01:02:26,675
All right, boys,
let's get the hell out

1057
01:02:26,677 --> 01:02:29,544

excuse for a bar.

01:04:58,527 --> 01:05:00,128
CBGB.

1092
01:05:00,130 --> 01:05:02,430
<i>...what time we're
going on tonight.</i>

1093
01:05:02,432 --> 01:05:04,199
Zeke wants to know what time
they're going on tonight.

1094
01:05:04,201 --> 01:05:05,600
I don't know yet.

1095
01:05:05,602 --> 01:05:08,937
Bastard won't tell me.

1096
01:05:08,939 --> 01:05:11,006
Yep, see you tonight.

1097
01:05:14,443 --> 01:05:16,811
This is good for you.

1098
01:05:16,813 --> 01:05:19,881
"The Ramones are
the apotheosis of punk."

1099
01:05:22,051 --> 01:05:23,818
Frank rose again.

1100
01:05:23,820 --> 01:05:26,955
"They are an acknowledgement
of the failure of glitter."

1101
01:05:26,957 --> 01:05:28,523
That they are.

1102
01:05:28,525 --> 01:05:30,458
"Brevity is the soul of wit,

1103
01:05:30,460 --> 01:05:32,560
"and it is right at the heart
of the Ramones' music.

1104
01:05:32,562 --> 01:05:35,597
They cannot be accused
of dragging out a number."

1105
01:05:35,599 --> 01:05:38,079
You just gotta hope they
don't kill each other.

1106
01:05:40,903 --> 01:05:43,838
Call Leslie.

1107
01:05:43,840 --> 01:05:46,041
Number is on the wall.

1108
01:05:51,914 --> 01:05:53,782
Hilly Kristal?

1109
01:05:53,784 --> 01:05:55,951
My understanding is that
there is a, uh,

1110
01:05:55,953 --> 01:05:58,286
problem with the rent.

1111
01:05:58,288 --> 01:06:00,889
And when the rent doesn't get
paid, it comes to me to collect.

1112
01:06:00,891 --> 01:06:02,724
But, you see,
I'm forced to double it

1113
01:06:02,726 --> 01:06:04,159
to cover my overhead.

1114
01:06:04,161 --> 01:06:06,861
So now we have
a compounded problem...

1115
01:06:06,863 --> 01:06:08,463
<i>How many are there?
Three.</i>

1116
01:06:08,465 --> 01:06:10,832
<i>They packin'
Yeah.</i>

1117
01:06:10,834 --> 01:06:12,267
The rent check's on its way,

1118
01:06:12,269 --> 01:06:14,302
but I'll just...

1119
01:06:14,304 --> 01:06:16,338
Need to think about
the doubling part.

1120
01:06:16,340 --> 01:06:18,006
There's nothing
to think about, Mr. Kristal.

1121
01:06:18,008 --> 01:06:19,841
You guys thirsty?
Cut the shit!

1122
01:06:19,843 --> 01:06:21,376
You have a strong
business that operates

1123
01:06:21,378 --> 01:06:22,978
to full capacity
almost every night.

1124
01:06:22,980 --> 01:06:25,213
So let me explain
something to you.

1125
01:06:25,215 --> 01:06:27,482
I'm not a very patient man.

1126
01:06:27,484 --> 01:06:29,924
So I suggest you give me
what I came here for.

1127
01:06:40,997 --> 01:06:42,497
How you been, Leslie?

1128
01:06:42,499 --> 01:06:43,832
I haven't been feeling so good.

1129
01:06:43,834 --> 01:06:46,434
Think I got a tapeworm.

1130
01:06:46,436 --> 01:06:48,937
Quit calling me that.

1131
01:06:48,939 --> 01:06:50,905
Do you guys know who
you're dealing with?

1132
01:06:50,907 --> 01:06:54,843
Get in the fucking car!

1133
01:06:54,845 --> 01:06:57,112
Go, let's go!
Scooch over.

1134
01:07:06,355 --> 01:07:09,090
What was that?!
A shakedown.

1135
01:07:09,092 --> 01:07:11,326
New York style.

1136
01:07:11,328 --> 01:07:14,462
I don't understand.

1137
01:07:14,464 --> 01:07:16,364
You paid the rent, right?

1138
01:07:20,036 --> 01:07:21,503
Everything all right?

1139
01:07:21,505 --> 01:07:23,872
Why wouldn't it be?

1140
01:07:23,874 --> 01:07:26,841
I wrote a rent check last week.

1141
01:07:26,843 --> 01:07:28,610
So it was a misunderstanding?

1142
01:07:28,612 --> 01:07:31,780
Well, I didn't send it.

1143
01:07:31,782 --> 01:07:33,114
What?!

1144
01:07:33,116 --> 01:07:36,718
Why not?!
I forgot.

1145
01:07:36,720 --> 01:07:38,253
Dad!
What?

1146
01:07:38,255 --> 01:07:40,755
I am taking over the books
whether you like it or not!

1147
01:07:40,757 --> 01:07:42,757
Because if I don't,
someone is going

1148
01:07:42,759 --> 01:07:45,226
to come here and kill you!

1149
01:07:45,228 --> 01:07:46,895
Okay.
Okay?

1150
01:07:46,897 --> 01:07:48,563
Yeah.

1151
01:07:48,565 --> 01:07:51,566
Okay.

1152
01:08:00,876 --> 01:08:03,912
Hello there!

1153
01:08:03,914 --> 01:08:05,780
Kristal, this your truck?

1154
01:08:05,782 --> 01:08:07,182
You know it is.

1155
01:08:07,184 --> 01:08:08,817
I'm gonna have to write you up.

1156
01:08:08,819 --> 01:08:11,586
Why?
Did you read the sign?

1157
01:08:15,458 --> 01:08:17,725
You and I both know

1158
01:08:17,727 --> 01:08:20,428
how long this truck
has been parked here

1159
01:08:20,430 --> 01:08:22,931
in this exact spot

1160
01:08:22,933 --> 01:08:24,732
without getting a ticket.

1161
01:08:24,734 --> 01:08:27,035
Well, New York
is going bankrupt.

1162
01:08:27,037 --> 01:08:28,770
There's pressure
to bring in some revenue.

1163
01:08:28,772 --> 01:08:31,506
Well,

1164
01:08:31,508 --> 01:08:35,743
this car has been here all day.

1165
01:08:47,990 --> 01:08:51,259
Move the truck.

1166
01:08:51,261 --> 01:08:53,962
City's cracking down.

1167
01:09:05,307 --> 01:09:06,774
You're not telling me
the whole story.

1168
01:09:06,776 --> 01:09:09,544
What's that supposed to mean?

1169
01:09:09,546 --> 01:09:13,314
Where does the cash go
at the end of the night?

1170
01:09:13,316 --> 01:09:14,816
After I count it?

1171
01:09:14,818 --> 01:09:16,317
Stop it.
What?

1172
01:09:16,319 --> 01:09:19,354
What happens to the cash
at the end of the night?

1173
01:09:19,356 --> 01:09:21,923
I put it in the freezer.

1174
01:09:21,925 --> 01:09:24,392
What?

1175
01:09:24,394 --> 01:09:26,728
In my apartment.
You got an apartment?

1176
01:09:26,730 --> 01:09:29,164
I can't sleep on a mattress

1177
01:09:29,166 --> 01:09:32,033

signed right and left.

where we're at.

01:09:35,872 --> 01:09:38,306

You go to the freezer

1181
01:09:38,308 --> 01:09:40,775
in your apartment
and get the money now.

1182
01:09:40,777 --> 01:09:42,944
Pay the rent, now,

1183
01:09:42,946 --> 01:09:45,280
and take the rest
to the bank, now.

1184

I don't know how this is
going to work out with you

1185

1186
01:09:48,318 --> 01:09:52,487

Okay.

1194
01:10:55,318 --> 01:10:56,784
You know, Bert,
I've been thinking

1195
01:10:56,786 --> 01:10:59,621
I should start managing
some of those bands.

1196

in the front room here!

The shirts.

1199
01:11:37,226 --> 01:11:39,294
Punk isn't about decay,

1200
01:11:39,296 --> 01:11:42,330
it's about the apocalypse.
It's about annihilation.

Nothing works, so let's
skip right to armageddon.

If the world is ending,

1203
01:11:49,072 --> 01:11:51,339
you might as well
do away with pretense

1204
01:11:51,341 --> 01:11:52,940

Uh, listen, I need a drink.

Glenlivet with a twist.

Coming right up.
Okay.

1236
01:13:25,935 --> 01:13:27,468
We don't have any glenlivet.

1237
01:13:27,470 --> 01:13:29,137
We'll take care of it,
go talk to Lisa.

1238
01:13:29,139 --> 01:13:30,938
Come this way, Mrs. Kristal.

1239
01:13:30,940 --> 01:13:32,940
I have a special spot
for you right over here.

1240
01:13:32,942 --> 01:13:37,345
Excuse me!
Watch your backs!

1241
01:13:37,347 --> 01:13:39,113
This is what you're spending.

1242
01:13:39,115 --> 01:13:40,548
This is what you're making.

1243
01:13:40,550 --> 01:13:41,916
I have to get back out there.

1244
01:13:41,918 --> 01:13:45,753
Give her a minute, hilly.

1245
01:13:45,755 --> 01:13:47,288
You're spending too much.

1246
01:13:47,290 --> 01:13:49,957
You cannot afford
to personally take on a band.

1247
01:13:49,959 --> 01:13:51,692
I agree with Lisa on this.

1248
01:13:51,694 --> 01:13:54,629
Oh, this is about
the dead boys.

1249
01:13:54,631 --> 01:13:56,164
Ye- before we branch out,

1250
01:13:56,166 --> 01:13:57,999
we need to get our
primary business in order.

1251
01:13:58,001 --> 01:14:00,668
And we need to put proper
vendor agreements in place.

1252
01:14:00,670 --> 01:14:02,804
We need to have billing cycles.

1253
01:14:02,806 --> 01:14:04,772
Look here, okay?

1254
01:14:04,774 --> 01:14:08,276
This is what you're
spending on toilet paper.

1255
01:14:08,278 --> 01:14:09,777
I don't believe that.

1256
01:14:09,779 --> 01:14:11,879
You're getting it from
the deli, a lot of it!

1257
01:14:11,881 --> 01:14:14,048
If you buy it in bulk, you can get
it for a fraction of the price.

1258
01:14:14,050 --> 01:14:17,051
This is what you're
spending on beer.

1259
01:14:17,053 --> 01:14:19,954
This is what you are bringing in
on the bar in general.

1260
01:14:19,956 --> 01:14:22,223
Hey, too many customers
are drinking for free!

1261
01:14:22,225 --> 01:14:23,791
This is bullshit.
Hilly, cut it out!

1262
01:14:23,793 --> 01:14:25,593
Why are we talking
about toilet paper?!

1263
01:14:25,595 --> 01:14:27,328
I have Genya Ravan out there

1264
01:14:27,330 --> 01:14:29,330
ready to produce
the dead boys album!

1265
01:14:29,332 --> 01:14:31,032
You're wasting my time!

1266
01:14:31,034 --> 01:14:32,433
Fine.

1267
01:14:32,435 --> 01:14:34,068
Goddamn it, hilly.

1268
01:14:36,538 --> 01:14:39,207
This is quite good!

1269
01:14:40,709 --> 01:14:43,945
Hilly's chili, huh?

1270
01:14:47,216 --> 01:14:49,016
Word is, Stiv Bators

1271
01:14:49,018 --> 01:14:52,520
jerks off in that chili.

1272
01:14:52,522 --> 01:14:54,989
I've had worse in my mouth.

1273
01:14:57,893 --> 01:14:59,760
Everything okay, mother?

1274
01:14:59,762 --> 01:15:01,996
Delicious!

1275
01:15:08,103 --> 01:15:09,704
What are you doing?

1276
01:15:09,706 --> 01:15:12,206
Trying to light a cigarette.

1277
01:15:26,121 --> 01:15:29,190
You shouldn't smoke.

1278
01:15:29,192 --> 01:15:32,527
That shit'll kill ya.

1279
01:15:32,529 --> 01:15:35,997
I don't smoke.

1280
01:15:35,999 --> 01:15:39,600
You know, your old man

1281
01:15:39,602 --> 01:15:41,168
is really not such a bad guy.

1282
01:15:41,170 --> 01:15:45,039
Well, you obviously
don't know him very well.

1283
01:15:45,041 --> 01:15:49,143
Oh God, zip, Idaho!
Please!

1284
01:15:49,145 --> 01:15:51,045
Excuse me.

1285
01:15:51,047 --> 01:15:53,481
Sometimes you hurt

1286
01:15:53,483 --> 01:15:57,518
the ones you love the most.

1287
01:15:57,520 --> 01:16:00,154
What fortune cookie
did you read that in?

1288
01:16:00,156 --> 01:16:02,256
Nah.

1289
01:16:02,258 --> 01:16:06,661
I got it from a poster
in the subway

1290
01:16:06,663 --> 01:16:10,598
across from this bench
I kinda like.

1291
01:16:10,600 --> 01:16:13,568
I prefer rachmaninoff, hillel.

1292
01:16:13,570 --> 01:16:15,536
Yeah, I prefer Beethoven
myself.

1293
01:16:15,538 --> 01:16:17,538
That punk rock shit
gives me a headache.

1294
01:16:17,540 --> 01:16:19,473
No shit.

1295
01:16:34,990 --> 01:16:37,358
Mom was right to leave you.

1296
01:16:37,360 --> 01:16:38,893
You're an asshole.

1297
01:16:38,895 --> 01:16:40,561
Lisa what?

1298
01:16:40,563 --> 01:16:44,966
In my capacity as asshole,

1299
01:16:44,968 --> 01:16:48,836
I am promoting you to vice
president of business affairs.

1300
01:16:48,838 --> 01:16:51,472
Is that supposed to be
some kind of apology?

1301
01:16:51,474 --> 01:16:55,076
The dead boys are gonna
change things for me, Lisa.

1302
01:16:55,078 --> 01:16:56,577
I am gonna get them
a record deal,

1303
01:16:56,579 --> 01:16:58,913
and they are gonna be big!

1304
01:17:10,826 --> 01:17:13,394
I'm so sick of TV

1305
01:17:13,396 --> 01:17:17,031
you know I'm getting
bored of the tubes

1306
01:17:17,033 --> 01:17:19,033
And I'm so sick of romance

1307
01:17:19,035 --> 01:17:21,535
I refuse to chase you, Lisa!

1308
01:17:24,006 --> 01:17:25,606
I've had it, hilly.

1309
01:17:25,608 --> 01:17:27,975
I can't take it anymore!
The fleas and the shit!

1310
01:17:27,977 --> 01:17:29,744
Your dog is crapping
everywhere!

1311
01:17:29,746 --> 01:17:31,345
It's disgusting,
this is not a kennel!

1312
01:17:31,347 --> 01:17:33,681
Either Jonathan goes, or I go!

1313
01:17:36,551 --> 01:17:40,021
Taxi, you don't like it,

1314
01:17:40,023 --> 01:17:42,857
you don't have to work here!

1315
01:17:42,859 --> 01:17:45,926
I don't play my stereo too

1316
01:17:45,928 --> 01:17:49,597
Just wanna get out
on the street fights

1317
01:17:49,599 --> 01:17:52,133
Just ain't nothin' to do

1318
01:17:52,135 --> 01:17:54,301
I get on out of here

1319
01:17:54,303 --> 01:17:57,772
find somethin' to do

1320
01:17:57,774 --> 01:17:59,774
yeah get on out of here

1321
01:17:59,776 --> 01:18:01,442
just ain't nothin' to do

1322
01:18:12,788 --> 01:18:14,755
so, is that your
real hair color,

1323
01:18:14,757 --> 01:18:17,391
or do you just dye it that way?

1324
01:18:17,393 --> 01:18:19,160
Who wants to know?

1325
01:18:19,162 --> 01:18:20,628
Me.

1326
01:18:20,630 --> 01:18:22,763
It's real.

1327
01:18:34,209 --> 01:18:36,911
So, now you know.

1328
01:18:36,913 --> 01:18:39,847
Yeah, we're good.

1329
01:18:57,399 --> 01:19:01,001
So, they vomit, they drop trow,

1330
01:19:01,003 --> 01:19:02,803
they slash themselves,
they bleed,

1331
01:19:02,805 --> 01:19:05,473
they hang themselves,
and that's just on stage.

1332
01:19:05,475 --> 01:19:07,041
I think their on-stage antics

1333
01:19:07,043 --> 01:19:09,610
are evidence of commitment.

1334
01:19:11,947 --> 01:19:13,414
Hilly, I don't want to produce

1335
01:19:13,416 --> 01:19:15,916
a shit album for
a flash-in-the-pan band.

1336
01:19:15,918 --> 01:19:19,453
Fine, I'll find somebody else.

1337
01:19:30,298 --> 01:19:33,667
We're gonna need money.
Yep.

1338
01:19:33,669 --> 01:19:35,636
And we're gonna need
to take them out on the road.

1339
01:19:35,638 --> 01:19:37,872
Yep.

1340
01:19:37,874 --> 01:19:39,740
Cheetah doesn't trust me.

1341
01:19:39,742 --> 01:19:41,575
Cheetah takes too many drugs.

1342
01:19:41,577 --> 01:19:43,911
Sire is interested
in signing you if we

1343
01:19:43,913 --> 01:19:45,613
can show the band is reliable

1344
01:19:45,615 --> 01:19:47,281
and people will pay to see you.

1345
01:19:47,283 --> 01:19:51,752
We are the definition
of reliable.

1346
01:19:55,991 --> 01:20:00,327
What'd I miss?

1347
01:20:00,329 --> 01:20:04,398
Let's make a demo
and get out on the road.

1348
01:20:04,400 --> 01:20:06,467
Hilly, how much money is this?

1349
01:20:06,469 --> 01:20:08,302
We are gonna rock and shock.

1350
01:20:08,304 --> 01:20:10,404
Don't screw this up.

1351
01:20:10,406 --> 01:20:12,406
Scouts honor.

1352
01:20:12,408 --> 01:20:15,442
Yeah, I heard she fucked bowie

1353
01:20:15,444 --> 01:20:18,412
at... at CB's.

1354
01:20:18,414 --> 01:20:20,181
In the bathroom.

1355
01:20:20,183 --> 01:20:23,217
Fuck in a bathroom at CB's,
that's not sanitary.

1356
01:20:27,088 --> 01:20:28,789
What the fuck is that?

1357
01:20:28,791 --> 01:20:30,724
What?

1358
01:20:30,726 --> 01:20:33,294
Get rid of those
fucking things.

1359
01:20:33,296 --> 01:20:36,864
They're just stickers.

1360
01:20:36,866 --> 01:20:39,834
Hilly, your manager- hey!

1361
01:20:39,836 --> 01:20:41,335
Hilly, your manager,

1362
01:20:41,337 --> 01:20:43,571
the guy who is footing the bill

1363
01:20:43,573 --> 01:20:45,406
for all of this, he's Jewish.

1364
01:20:45,408 --> 01:20:47,741
Me, your producer, I'm Jewish.

1365
01:20:47,743 --> 01:20:49,210
And the guy who
owns this studio,

1366
01:20:49,212 --> 01:20:50,644
who is doing us a favor

1367
01:20:50,646 --> 01:20:53,747
by letting us record at
these ridiculous prices,

1368
01:20:53,749 --> 01:20:57,084
he's got numbers
tattooed on his arm.

1369
01:20:57,086 --> 01:20:59,820
Do you know what that means?

1370
01:20:59,822 --> 01:21:01,121
Not really.

1371
01:21:01,123 --> 01:21:03,224
Auschwitz!

1372
01:21:03,226 --> 01:21:06,193
Hitler!
Nazis!

1373
01:21:06,195 --> 01:21:09,864
Now get rid of
the fucking swastikas!

1374
01:21:09,866 --> 01:21:11,465
Okay, fucking lighten up.

1375
01:21:11,467 --> 01:21:14,501
I'll get rid of them.

1376
01:21:14,503 --> 01:21:17,838
Look, you guys,
you're not Nazis, okay?

1377
01:21:17,840 --> 01:21:19,640
You're punks.

1378
01:21:19,642 --> 01:21:22,076
And anything bad,
anything wrong,

1379
01:21:22,078 --> 01:21:25,880
you wanna do it.
I get it.

1380
01:21:25,882 --> 01:21:27,948
Now let's go have a bagel.

1381
01:21:27,950 --> 01:21:30,184
What's a bagel?
What's- what's a bagel?

1382
01:21:30,186 --> 01:21:31,652
What part of Cleveland
are you from?

1383
01:21:31,654 --> 01:21:33,153
Cleveland, Germany?

1384
01:21:33,155 --> 01:21:35,990
[Hilly] What is punk rock?

1385
01:21:35,992 --> 01:21:38,726
Well, call it street music.

1386
01:21:38,728 --> 01:21:42,162
Look, all I care about
is originality.

1387
01:21:42,164 --> 01:21:46,333
These kids have
something to say.

1388
01:21:46,335 --> 01:21:50,404
We really should listen.

1389
01:21:56,945 --> 01:22:01,582
We're the dead boys!

1390
01:22:01,584 --> 01:22:04,184
I- I don't want you

1391
01:22:04,186 --> 01:22:06,854
to hang around

1392
01:22:09,057 --> 01:22:11,592
yeah, I don't need you

1393
01:22:11,594 --> 01:22:15,930
to drag me down

1394
01:22:15,932 --> 01:22:18,866
I- I don't really

1395
01:22:18,868 --> 01:22:23,103
wanna dance

1396
01:22:23,105 --> 01:22:24,905
hello, Poughkeepsie!

1397
01:22:24,907 --> 01:22:29,176
I just wanna
get in your pants

1398
01:22:29,178 --> 01:22:31,845
What's up, Cleveland?

1399
01:22:36,351 --> 01:22:37,851
Fuck you, new haven!

1400
01:22:37,853 --> 01:22:39,153
Fuck off, Boston!

1401
01:22:39,155 --> 01:22:40,854
Suck my balls, bridgeport!

1402
01:22:40,856 --> 01:22:42,756
You cry and cry

1403
01:22:42,758 --> 01:22:45,926
you know I'll
prick you in the end

1404
01:22:48,096 --> 01:22:50,497
Ya look at me
that way, bitch

1405
01:22:50,499 --> 01:22:55,135
Your face is gonna
get a punch

1406
01:22:55,137 --> 01:22:56,804
Hello, white plains!

1407
01:23:17,792 --> 01:23:19,760
We're the dead boys!

1408
01:23:34,976 --> 01:23:38,278
I swallowed my gum.

1409
01:23:38,280 --> 01:23:39,813
What the h-

1410
01:23:39,815 --> 01:23:42,416
I mean- what the h-

1411
01:23:42,418 --> 01:23:43,884
do you want a record deal?!

1412
01:23:43,886 --> 01:23:45,719
Said sorry, you know?

1413
01:23:50,158 --> 01:23:52,626
Go!

1414
01:23:54,562 --> 01:23:56,930
Go!

1415
01:24:20,622 --> 01:24:23,123
Have a nice day.

1416
01:24:27,095 --> 01:24:29,096
May I help you?

1417
01:24:35,537 --> 01:24:38,038
Why would you save

1418
01:24:38,040 --> 01:24:41,642
for your dreams?

1419
01:24:41,644 --> 01:24:43,343
Why not live your dreams?

1420
01:24:43,345 --> 01:24:44,745
Absolutely.

1421
01:24:44,747 --> 01:24:47,314
Hilly Kristal.

1422
01:24:47,316 --> 01:24:49,183
How much do I have
in my account?

1423
01:24:52,353 --> 01:24:54,688
$312.17.

1424
01:24:54,690 --> 01:24:58,092
Keep the 17 cents.

1425
01:24:58,094 --> 01:25:02,796
I'll take the rest.

1426
01:25:02,798 --> 01:25:05,032
What are you doing, hilly?

1427
01:25:05,034 --> 01:25:06,667
Were you following me?
Me?

1428
01:25:06,669 --> 01:25:08,302
Follow you, no,
why would I follow you?

1429
01:25:08,304 --> 01:25:10,704
Yes, I'm following you!

1430
01:25:10,706 --> 01:25:12,506
What are you doing?

1431
01:25:12,508 --> 01:25:13,774
Investing.

1432
01:25:13,776 --> 01:25:17,511
In what?
Treasury bills?

1433
01:25:17,513 --> 01:25:19,546
I'm taking the money
out of the CBGB account

1434
01:25:19,548 --> 01:25:21,582
to float the dead boys
development fund.

1435
01:25:21,584 --> 01:25:23,283
That's the stupidest thing
I've ever heard.

1436
01:25:23,285 --> 01:25:24,718
You can't.
You watch me.

1437
01:25:24,720 --> 01:25:26,720
We got bills to pay!

1438
01:25:26,722 --> 01:25:29,156
You have no vision, Merv.

1439
01:25:29,158 --> 01:25:30,591
Well, I quit!

1440
01:25:30,593 --> 01:25:32,559
I'll call you later!
I won't answer!

1441
01:25:32,561 --> 01:25:34,795
Oh, yes you will!
No, I won't!

1442
01:25:56,518 --> 01:25:58,652
I went to a pawnshop.

1443
01:26:03,725 --> 01:26:06,293
Sold everything.

1444
01:26:08,129 --> 01:26:10,764
My father's watch.

1445
01:26:14,903 --> 01:26:16,670
They destroyed your truck.

1446
01:26:16,672 --> 01:26:18,005
And their equipment.

1447
01:26:18,007 --> 01:26:20,207
They're gonna need equipment.

1448
01:26:26,748 --> 01:26:29,283
Why are you doing this?
I believe in them.

1449
01:26:34,222 --> 01:26:36,823
Hey.

1450
01:26:36,825 --> 01:26:38,525
Thank you.

1451
01:26:38,527 --> 01:26:41,361
Why are you thanking me?

1452
01:26:41,363 --> 01:26:44,965
Somebody should.

1453
01:26:49,837 --> 01:26:53,040
This is not the end
of the world.

1454
01:26:53,042 --> 01:26:56,076
I mean, this could be good
for us if we manage it right.

1455
01:26:56,078 --> 01:26:58,879
We are punks, after all.

1456
01:26:58,881 --> 01:27:00,347
Blitz might be dead.

1457
01:27:00,349 --> 01:27:02,816
The last thing I care about
is publicity for a band

1458
01:27:02,818 --> 01:27:05,352
who's about to cost me my club.

1459
01:27:13,661 --> 01:27:15,362
How is he?

1460
01:27:15,364 --> 01:27:19,099
He's, um- he's critical.

1461
01:27:19,101 --> 01:27:20,968
Fuck.

1462
01:27:26,641 --> 01:27:30,644
Do you still have the money?

1463
01:27:30,646 --> 01:27:32,946
Yeah.

1464
01:27:32,948 --> 01:27:34,348
Blitz is gonna need it.

1465
01:27:34,350 --> 01:27:37,084
Make sure he gets
good medical care.

1466
01:27:37,086 --> 01:27:38,385
Where you going?

1467
01:27:38,387 --> 01:27:41,288
I'm not your father!

1468
01:27:41,290 --> 01:27:43,757
I'm just your manager.

1469
01:27:45,593 --> 01:27:48,595
I can't do this anymore.

1470
01:27:51,966 --> 01:27:54,434
<i>[The Velvet Underground's

1471
01:27:57,773 --> 01:27:59,106
Jersey.

1472
01:27:59,108 --> 01:28:01,508
Hightstown.

1473
01:28:19,794 --> 01:28:24,464
Say a word for Jimmy brown

1474
01:28:25,700 --> 01:28:28,902
he ain't got nothin' at all

1475
01:28:33,041 --> 01:28:37,611
Not the shirt
right off his back

1476
01:28:38,913 --> 01:28:41,915
He ain't got nothin' at all

1477
01:28:45,053 --> 01:28:49,656
And say a word
for ginger brown

1478
01:28:52,193 --> 01:28:56,897
Walks with his head down
to the ground

1479
01:28:58,566 --> 01:29:00,400
Took the shoes

1480
01:29:00,402 --> 01:29:04,371
right off his feet

1481
01:29:04,373 --> 01:29:07,708
threw the poor boy
right out in the street

1482
01:29:07,710 --> 01:29:11,111
And this is what he said

1483
01:29:11,113 --> 01:29:13,980
oh sweet nothing...

1484
01:29:13,982 --> 01:29:17,384
Can I help you?

1485
01:29:17,386 --> 01:29:20,053
I'm sorry.

1486
01:29:20,055 --> 01:29:21,855
I grew up here.

1487
01:29:21,857 --> 01:29:23,457
Uh-huh.

1488
01:29:23,459 --> 01:29:27,094
Hilly Kristal.

1489
01:29:27,096 --> 01:29:29,596
Hilly Kristal.

1490
01:29:29,598 --> 01:29:32,833
Hilly.

1491
01:29:32,835 --> 01:29:36,370
Are you the kid that started
that rock 'n roll club?

1492
01:29:36,372 --> 01:29:38,839
Unfortunately, that's me.

1493
01:29:38,841 --> 01:29:41,475
My nephew's band
played there once.

1494
01:29:41,477 --> 01:29:45,278
Teenage Jesus and the jerks.

1495
01:29:48,015 --> 01:29:50,417
Coffee's inside, come on.

1496
01:29:55,223 --> 01:29:57,591
I saw a little bird

1497
01:29:57,593 --> 01:29:59,793
sitting in a tree

1498
01:29:59,795 --> 01:30:03,430
who wanted
to start a family

1499
01:30:03,432 --> 01:30:07,534
He went tweet,
tweet, tweet tweet

1500
01:30:07,536 --> 01:30:12,038
He were looking for a she

1501
01:30:12,040 --> 01:30:16,243
He couldn't wait
to find a mate

1502
01:30:16,245 --> 01:30:19,579
Sat in a tree
and sang a plea

1503
01:30:19,581 --> 01:30:23,517
He went tweet,
tweet, tweet tweet

1504
01:30:23,519 --> 01:30:26,520
He were looking for a she

1505
01:30:29,690 --> 01:30:31,024
Where the hell are you?!

1506
01:30:31,026 --> 01:30:32,893
Everybody is worried about you!

01:30:32,895 --> 01:30:35,295
<i>I'm done. It's over.</i>

1508
01:30:35,297 --> 01:30:38,298
No, no way.
I won't let you.

1509
01:30:38,300 --> 01:30:40,133
I can't even pay the rent.

1510
01:30:40,135 --> 01:30:41,802
Yeah, you can.

1511
01:30:41,804 --> 01:30:44,504
And yes, you will.

1512
01:30:44,506 --> 01:30:47,307
Look, you may be a lousy
businessman, dad,

1513
01:30:47,309 --> 01:30:49,976
but, damn it, you are
the father of underground rock

1514
01:30:49,978 --> 01:30:52,179
and OMFUG, whatever
the hell that is.

1515
01:30:52,181 --> 01:30:54,514
And it's not all about you.

1516
01:30:54,516 --> 01:30:55,949
<i>Okay, there are kids

1517
01:30:55,951 --> 01:31:00,120

to play at CBGB one day.

1518
01:31:00,122 --> 01:31:04,458
<i>So stop feeling sorry for yourself
right now and get over here.</i>

1519
01:31:04,460 --> 01:31:08,762

and feed Jonathan.

1521
01:31:10,032 --> 01:31:11,565

1522
01:31:11,567 --> 01:31:13,433
No. I don't have
the lineup for tonight.

1523
01:31:13,435 --> 01:31:16,937

Hey, hilly!

1527
01:31:21,710 --> 01:31:23,777
Hilly.

1528
01:31:35,089 --> 01:31:37,958
I just don't get it.

1529
01:31:37,960 --> 01:31:42,128
Why did you risk everything
on the dead boys?

1530
01:31:42,130 --> 01:31:45,932
Was it the auto-asphyxiation
or the self-mutilation?

1531
01:31:47,168 --> 01:31:48,835
They could've been
a bellwether.

1532
01:31:48,837 --> 01:31:51,438
That's debatable.

1533
01:31:54,642 --> 01:31:57,711
I'm going to law school.

1534
01:31:57,713 --> 01:32:01,381
Really?

1535
01:32:01,383 --> 01:32:03,183
How come?

1536
01:32:03,185 --> 01:32:05,785
Cause I know you're
gonna need me to.

1537
01:32:05,787 --> 01:32:09,556
Even though I know
you'll never admit it.

1538
01:32:09,558 --> 01:32:13,760
Your friends have been waiting out
there for you all fucking day.

1539
01:32:13,762 --> 01:32:15,362
Get your ass out there!

1540
01:32:15,364 --> 01:32:19,733
I really don't appreciate
all the swearing.

1541
01:32:29,877 --> 01:32:30,377
Um...

1542
01:32:34,149 --> 01:32:38,318
I know you all counted on me,
but the thing is, I'm broke,

1543
01:32:38,320 --> 01:32:40,520
and I think we're gonna have
to close the club.

1544
01:32:40,522 --> 01:32:43,723
Oh, God!

1545
01:32:43,725 --> 01:32:47,360
How many years have
we listened to your shit?

1546
01:32:47,362 --> 01:32:51,631
Lisa and I made a few calls.

1547
01:32:51,633 --> 01:32:53,333
A lot of calls.

1548
01:32:53,335 --> 01:32:55,435
And people wanted to help.

1549
01:32:55,437 --> 01:32:57,604
Yeah, like people
that you helped

1550
01:32:57,606 --> 01:33:00,240
even when you
didn't have the money.

1551
01:33:00,242 --> 01:33:03,143
But, uh...

1552
01:33:03,145 --> 01:33:05,211
Lisa's gonna take care of this.

1553
01:33:05,213 --> 01:33:06,580
She's gonna pay the bills.

1554
01:33:06,582 --> 01:33:11,451
She's gonna get the place
back on track.

1555
01:33:11,453 --> 01:33:12,919
I want you to have this.

1556
01:33:12,921 --> 01:33:16,957
It's all I got.

I have a...

1558
01:33:19,494 --> 01:33:20,994
Don't tell anybody.

1559
01:33:20,996 --> 01:33:24,631
I have a gold filling
in my tooth, in the back.

1560
01:33:24,633 --> 01:33:26,166
You could probably
take it out like this.

1561
01:33:26,168 --> 01:33:30,637
Thanks, Idaho.

1562
01:33:30,639 --> 01:33:34,674
Looks like I'm not gonna
need either of those.

1563
01:33:48,055 --> 01:33:50,223
Okay.

1564
01:33:50,225 --> 01:33:55,195

Well, there is something there.

There is definitely
something there.

CBGB because...

1592
01:35:35,263 --> 01:35:40,166
I thought country music was
gonna become the next big thing.

1593
01:35:43,471 --> 01:35:47,273
And it did.

1594
01:35:47,275 --> 01:35:49,709
In Nashville.

1595
01:35:49,711 --> 01:35:53,079
Know my mind is made up

1596
01:35:53,081 --> 01:35:56,750
so put away your makeup

1597
01:35:56,752 --> 01:35:59,986
told you once,
I won't tell you again

1598
01:35:59,988 --> 01:36:03,089

Heard of some grave sites

out by the highway

1605
01:36:28,383 --> 01:36:31,718
a place where nobody knows

1606
01:36:31,720 --> 01:36:33,653
The sound of gunfire

off in the distance

1608
01:36:35,524 --> 01:36:39,058

you don't even
know my real name

1624
01:37:14,763 --> 01:37:16,763
High on a hillside

1625
01:37:16,765 --> 01:37:18,598
the trucks are loading

1626
01:37:18,600 --> 01:37:22,001
everything's ready to roll

1627
01:37:22,003 --> 01:37:23,469
I sleep in the daytime

1628
01:37:23,471 --> 01:37:25,972
I work in the nighttime

1629
01:37:25,974 --> 01:37:29,542
I might not ever get home

1630
01:37:29,544 --> 01:37:31,311
this ain't no party

1631
01:37:31,313 --> 01:37:33,112
this ain't no disco

1632
01:37:33,114 --> 01:37:36,649
this ain't
no fooling around

1633
01:37:36,651 --> 01:37:38,484
This ain't no mudd club

1634
01:37:38,486 --> 01:37:40,420
or CBGB

1635
01:37:40,422 --> 01:37:43,857
I ain't got time
for that now

1636
01:37:55,035 --> 01:37:58,037
Talking heads,
get the hell up here please.

1637
01:38:05,079 --> 01:38:09,749
We wanna start
by thanking hilly Kristal.

1638
01:38:09,751 --> 01:38:12,151
We'd to invite hilly up here.

1639
01:38:12,153 --> 01:38:14,487
Hilly is the reason
that we're here,

1640
01:38:14,489 --> 01:38:15,755
that the Ramones are here,

1641
01:38:15,757 --> 01:38:17,123
that blondie are here.

1642
01:38:17,125 --> 01:38:20,994
He kept us alive.

1643
01:38:20,996 --> 01:38:23,396
He fed us and he supported us

1644
01:38:23,398 --> 01:38:26,132
in every way possible.

1645
01:38:26,134 --> 01:38:30,336
He told us we needed
to expand our sound,

1646
01:38:30,338 --> 01:38:33,506
and he taught us
a lot about ethics,

1647
01:38:33,508 --> 01:38:35,341
about how to treat people.

1648
01:38:35,343 --> 01:38:37,243
I'd like to thank hilly again.

1649
01:38:37,245 --> 01:38:38,478
When we were starting out,

1650
01:38:38,480 --> 01:38:39,746
there really weren't clubs

1651
01:38:39,748 --> 01:38:42,382
where bands could play
their own material,

1652
01:38:42,384 --> 01:38:44,584
and, uh, poor hilly wanted

1653
01:38:44,586 --> 01:38:47,220
to have a bluegrass bar
on the bowery,

1654
01:38:47,222 --> 01:38:49,656
and to have some
other music as well.

1655
01:38:49,658 --> 01:38:53,059
I guess the road
didn't go that way.

1656
01:38:53,061 --> 01:38:54,627
The road took another turn.

1657
01:38:54,629 --> 01:38:57,764
And, uh, thanks to-

1658
01:38:57,766 --> 01:39:00,533
I mean, we thank him,

1659
01:39:00,535 --> 01:39:02,769
because he went that
direction and didn't mind.

1660
01:39:02,771 --> 01:39:04,404
It was just extraordinary,

1661
01:39:04,406 --> 01:39:07,106
the fact that bands
came out of the woodwork.

1662
01:39:07,108 --> 01:39:08,942
They were everywhere.

1663
01:39:08,944 --> 01:39:10,276
They were coming
from out of state.

1664
01:39:10,278 --> 01:39:12,078
Nobody knew they were there.

1665
01:39:12,080 --> 01:39:14,280
They came out because
there was somewhere to play.

1666
01:39:14,282 --> 01:39:17,517
Hilly brought the music
into existence in many ways.

1667
01:39:17,519 --> 01:39:21,220
[Applause]

1668
01:40:26,587 --> 01:40:28,721
I saw a little bird

1669
01:40:28,723 --> 01:40:30,757
sittin' in a tree

1670
01:40:30,759 --> 01:40:33,893
who wanted to start
a family

1671
01:40:33,895 --> 01:40:36,896
Who went tweet, tweet

1672
01:40:36,898 --> 01:40:38,264
tweet, tweet

1673
01:40:38,266 --> 01:40:41,968
he went lookin' for a she

1674
01:40:41,970 --> 01:40:46,305
He couldn't wait
to find a mate

1675
01:40:46,307 --> 01:40:49,542
Sat in a tree
and sang a plea

1676
01:40:49,544 --> 01:40:51,978
He went tweet, tweet

1677
01:40:51,980 --> 01:40:53,346
tweet, tweet

1678
01:40:53,348 --> 01:40:56,516
he went looking for a she

1679
01:40:56,518 --> 01:40:58,484
There was a little bee

1680
01:40:58,486 --> 01:41:00,286
a- feelin' mighty free

1681
01:41:00,288 --> 01:41:03,723
some honey, he said
is good for me

1682
01:41:03,725 --> 01:41:06,492
He went a-buzz, buzz

1683
01:41:06,494 --> 01:41:07,794
a- buzz, buzz

1684
01:41:07,796 --> 01:41:11,130
he went looking for a she

1685
01:41:11,132 --> 01:41:14,734
you love me, I love you

1686
01:41:14,736 --> 01:41:18,704
Let's both do
what the birds and bees do

1687
01:41:18,706 --> 01:41:20,440
Buzz, buzz, buzz

1688
01:41:20,442 --> 01:41:21,974
tweet, tweet, tweet

1689
01:41:21,976 --> 01:41:24,544
that means I love you,
love you, love you

1690
01:41:24,546 --> 01:41:28,281
I love you all the time

1691
01:41:34,121 --> 01:41:37,623
isn't it a pity
that the lady from the city

1692
01:41:37,625 --> 01:41:41,160
Went inside a pen
and was taken for a hen

1693
01:41:41,162 --> 01:41:43,529
Turned her back
on a rooster

1694
01:41:43,531 --> 01:41:45,331
And when he promptly
goosed her

1695
01:41:45,333 --> 01:41:47,266
She received such
a bruise to her

1696
01:41:47,268 --> 01:41:49,135
More than she was used to

1697
01:41:49,137 --> 01:41:51,170
that she went back
to the city

1698
01:41:51,172 --> 01:41:52,972
And never came here again

1699
01:41:52,974 --> 01:41:55,141
isn't that a pity

1700
01:41:55,143 --> 01:41:56,642
isn't that a pity

1701
01:41:56,644 --> 01:41:59,245
that means I love you,
love you, love you

1702
01:41:59,247 --> 01:42:04,250
I love you all the time

1703
01:42:04,252 --> 01:42:07,587
that means I love you,
love you, love you, love you

1704
01:42:07,589 --> 01:42:11,991
All the time

1705
01:42:11,993 --> 01:42:14,827
that means I love you,
love you, love you

1706
01:42:14,829 --> 01:42:19,532
I love you all the time
