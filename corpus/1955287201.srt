[horses galloping and neighing]

5
00:00:31,799 --> 00:00:35,234
<i>Crime and aggression
became a way of life.</i>

6
00:00:35,236 --> 00:00:38,371
<i>Day to day existence
was difficult.</i>

7
00:00:38,373 --> 00:00:42,074
<i>Entire populations
were starving.</i>

8
00:00:42,076 --> 00:00:46,178

00:01:36,264 --> 00:01:40,466
Hey! Think you're
a great fighter?

15
00:01:40,468 --> 00:01:41,801
Uh-uh.

16
00:01:41,803 --> 00:01:43,803
- You wanna get hurt?
- Uh-uh.

17
00:01:43,805 --> 00:01:45,104
Then why are you asleep

18
00:01:45,106 --> 00:01:47,306
right in the middle
of my training?

19
00:01:47,308 --> 00:01:48,741
Huh?

20
00:01:48,743 --> 00:01:51,343
Captain, sir.
No, I wasn't really sleeping.

21
00:01:51,345 --> 00:01:52,845
I was just closing my eyes,

22
00:01:52,847 --> 00:01:54,880
that I could gain
more insight, you see.

23
00:01:54,882 --> 00:01:56,749
Oh, is that true?

24
00:01:56,751 --> 00:01:57,983
You gain more insight?

25
00:01:57,985 --> 00:01:59,218
Absolutely.

26
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:01,120
OK. Then go ahead.

27
00:02:01,122 --> 00:02:03,389
Uh. Sorry, sir.
I mean, yes, sir.

28
00:02:03,391 --> 00:02:05,791
- [soldiers laughing]
- All right. Show me.

29
00:02:05,793 --> 00:02:08,260
I want you to attack
me with your insight.

30
00:02:08,262 --> 00:02:09,295
Hyah!

31
00:02:09,297 --> 00:02:11,464
[soldiers laughing]

32
00:02:11,466 --> 00:02:14,266
Hyah!

[soldiers laughing]

34
00:02:15,803 --> 00:02:17,503
[captain] What are you doing?

35
00:02:17,505 --> 00:02:19,038
I'm warming up.

[grunting]

37
00:02:21,342 --> 00:02:23,409
- You warmed up now?
- Not yet. [grunting]

38
00:02:23,411 --> 00:02:25,778
Let's go!
If you don't come at me soon,

39
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:27,279
then I'll just have
to hit you first!

40
00:02:27,281 --> 00:02:29,148
Huh?
[grunts]

41
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:30,216
[blowing raspberry]

42
00:02:30,218 --> 00:02:31,851
Ridiculous.

43
00:02:31,853 --> 00:02:34,453
How do you plan to fight the
enemy and protect your country?

44
00:02:34,455 --> 00:02:37,423
Uh, why must we
fight each other?

45
00:02:37,425 --> 00:02:39,825
If we can live
together in harmony,

46
00:02:39,827 --> 00:02:41,260
then there's no reason to fight.

47
00:02:41,262 --> 00:02:43,763
- We can live in peace.
- Not true.

48
00:02:43,765 --> 00:02:46,365
There is no peace here.
Peace doesn't exist.

49
00:02:46,367 --> 00:02:48,334
The world as we know it is hard!

50
00:02:48,336 --> 00:02:50,069
[soldiers agreeing]

51
00:02:50,071 --> 00:02:53,105
You're wrong. There is a place
without any war.

52
00:02:53,107 --> 00:02:56,809
A peaceful place where
people live in harmony,

53
00:02:56,811 --> 00:02:58,978
and it's called Merryland.

54
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:01,180
[soldiers disagreeing]

55
00:03:06,053 --> 00:03:08,220

<i>[in head] Grandpa, I'll prove
that Merryland really does exist.</i>

00:03:21,936 --> 00:03:26,405
<i>And I'll prove that my
grandpa never lied to me.</i>

58

[whooshing noises]

59
00:03:29,443 --> 00:03:33,846
Ah. What a beautiful
meteor shower.

[wind rushing]

61
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:38,284
Wait a minute!

62
00:03:38,286 --> 00:03:39,585
Ahhh!

63
00:03:39,587 --> 00:03:42,454
[arrows whooshing
and hitting targets]

[galloping]

67
00:03:48,563 --> 00:03:50,896
Hurry, men! Go!

68
00:03:50,898 --> 00:03:52,097
The enemy is near!

69
00:03:52,099 --> 00:03:53,265
[captain] Get ready!

70
00:03:53,267 --> 00:03:56,268
But, sir, it's the enemy! Run!

71
00:03:56,270 --> 00:03:59,972
You coward! How can you retreat
at a time like this?

72
00:04:02,109 --> 00:04:03,275
[yelling]

73
00:04:03,277 --> 00:04:05,010
Ah!

74
00:04:07,615 --> 00:04:12,384
Don't chase me!
Somebody, somebody help!

75
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:09,041
[screaming]

76
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:11,577
[gasping for air]

77
00:05:11,579 --> 00:05:15,381
Grandpa, it won't be long now.
I'll see you soon.

78
00:05:15,383 --> 00:05:17,917
Ah, ah, ah!

79
00:05:22,356 --> 00:05:24,590
[splashing]

80
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:29,595
Ah, ah, ah!

81
00:05:29,597 --> 00:05:32,998
Ah, this must be heaven.
It's so beautiful here.

82
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,468
- Aggh! Pig?
- Uh-huh. That's right.

83
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:38,404
[boy] Wait. A talking pig?

84
00:05:38,406 --> 00:05:42,041
Why not? Well, if a panda
can talk, then why can't I?

85
00:05:42,043 --> 00:05:43,342
Huh?

86
00:05:43,344 --> 00:05:45,144
[boy] Wait.
A talking panda?

87
00:05:45,146 --> 00:05:48,647
Where? What panda?
I don't see any pandas here.

88
00:05:48,649 --> 00:05:50,282
[pig] How 'bout now?

89
00:05:50,284 --> 00:05:52,117
Oh, wow. It's a panda.

90
00:05:52,119 --> 00:05:54,286
What's a panda bear
doin' in that thing?

91
00:05:54,288 --> 00:05:56,121
[pig] It's called a mirror.

92
00:05:56,123 --> 00:05:59,425
A mirror?
Mirrors are made of glass.

93
00:05:59,427 --> 00:06:01,627
[pig] Hmm. Well,
this one's special.

94
00:06:01,629 --> 00:06:03,295
Oh.

95
00:06:03,297 --> 00:06:05,164
[gasping]

96
00:06:05,166 --> 00:06:07,366
Oh, no! You sure it's a mirror?

97
00:06:07,368 --> 00:06:10,669
- Yep.
- No, that can't be me!

98
00:06:10,671 --> 00:06:12,071
Mmm-hmm.

99
00:06:12,073 --> 00:06:14,273
This makes no sense.
I'm not a panda,

100
00:06:14,275 --> 00:06:16,709
and there's no such thing
as pigs who can talk.

101
00:06:16,711 --> 00:06:19,411
Impossible!

102
00:06:20,314 --> 00:06:24,049
Huh. He really
doesn't know how to fly?

103
00:06:24,051 --> 00:06:27,586
Hi-yah!

104
00:06:28,456 --> 00:06:32,358
[grunting]

105
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,727
Hey! You bumped into me.

106
00:06:34,729 --> 00:06:37,363
Sorry. I didn't
know you were there.

107
00:06:37,365 --> 00:06:39,298
[plant] Help!

108
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:41,533
[gasping for air]

109
00:06:46,307 --> 00:06:48,407
Wait a minute.

110
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:51,577
Where am I?

111
00:06:54,749 --> 00:06:57,182
Wow. Is this place for real?

112
00:06:57,184 --> 00:06:59,084
Whoa.

113
00:06:59,086 --> 00:07:01,353
Ahh! What a weird dream!

114
00:07:01,355 --> 00:07:02,788
Where'd I get these mittens?

115
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:05,290
And what's with this
black and white fur suit?

116
00:07:05,292 --> 00:07:07,626
Don't tell me I really
turned into a panda?

117
00:07:07,628 --> 00:07:10,095
Can you see my tail?
Is it back there?

118
00:07:10,097 --> 00:07:11,163
We're wasting a
lot of time here.

119
00:07:11,165 --> 00:07:12,231
I have things to do.

120
00:07:12,233 --> 00:07:13,265
Noooo! What do I do now?

121
00:07:13,267 --> 00:07:14,266
I don't want to be a panda.

122
00:07:14,268 --> 00:07:16,035
Put me back the way I was.

123
00:07:16,037 --> 00:07:18,203
Chill. Everything
will be fine.

124
00:07:18,205 --> 00:07:20,506
Now that I saved you.
[snorting]

125
00:07:20,508 --> 00:07:23,509
I've never seen a place like this before.
Where am I?

126
00:07:23,511 --> 00:07:25,611
This is Merryland.

127
00:07:26,781 --> 00:07:29,782
Huh?
Did you say Merryland?

128
00:07:29,784 --> 00:07:32,034
What, are you deaf?

129
00:07:32,035 --> 00:07:34,285
Of course. Where else
did you think we were? Hmm?

130
00:07:34,288 --> 00:07:36,121
Merryland really exists.

131
00:07:36,123 --> 00:07:37,589
Grandpa told me the truth.

132
00:07:37,591 --> 00:07:39,625
All right, it's true! Ha ha!

133
00:07:39,627 --> 00:07:41,827
[groaning]

134
00:07:41,829 --> 00:07:44,129
Hey, is something
wrong with your butt?

135
00:07:44,131 --> 00:07:45,664
You gonna be all right?

136
00:07:45,666 --> 00:07:48,700
Yeah, sure.
Uh-huh.

137
00:07:48,702 --> 00:07:51,503
Thanks. I guess I should
introduce myself.

138
00:07:51,505 --> 00:07:53,272
I'm Patrick.
Who are you?

139
00:07:53,274 --> 00:07:55,741
- Peggy Skyflyer.
- Peggy Skyflyer?

140
00:07:55,743 --> 00:07:58,677
- Yep.
- So you can really fly?

141
00:07:58,679 --> 00:08:00,245
Why is that so surprising?

142
00:08:00,247 --> 00:08:02,548
Hmm. Yeah, right.

143
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:05,551
I guess nothing should be
surprising at this point.

144
00:08:05,553 --> 00:08:08,487
Exactly. You're a
talking panda after all.

145
00:08:08,489 --> 00:08:11,457
[scoffs]
But I wasn't a panda before.

146
00:08:11,459 --> 00:08:13,592
I have no idea why I
turned into a panda

147
00:08:13,594 --> 00:08:15,127
all of the sudden.

148
00:08:15,129 --> 00:08:17,429
Oh, I see. So maybe
you're not a real panda.

149
00:08:17,431 --> 00:08:19,498
Huh? Looks real to me.

150
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,733
What else do you call
a black-and-white bear?

151
00:08:21,735 --> 00:08:24,703
But are you the
legendary Panda Warrior?

152
00:08:24,705 --> 00:08:28,373
Huh? Panda Warrior?

153
00:08:28,375 --> 00:08:30,442
Hmm. Well, it's pretty
hard to imagine you

154
00:08:30,444 --> 00:08:31,877
as much of a warrior.

155
00:08:31,879 --> 00:08:33,846
Yeah, yeah. Not so much.

156
00:08:33,848 --> 00:08:37,282
Ha ha. You got yourself
the wrong panda.

157
00:08:38,252 --> 00:08:40,152
Now! Whaaa!

158
00:08:40,154 --> 00:08:41,720
Oooh, whaaa!

159
00:08:41,722 --> 00:08:42,855
[vibrating lips]

160
00:08:42,857 --> 00:08:45,691
And, launch!
[farting]

161
00:08:45,693 --> 00:08:48,527
Gross! That is so stinky!

162
00:08:50,364 --> 00:08:53,265
Ah! Whoo!

163
00:08:53,267 --> 00:08:56,335
Well, would you look at that?
Who knew?

164
00:08:56,337 --> 00:08:58,270
Pigs really can fly!

165
00:08:58,272 --> 00:08:59,404
Well, of course.

166
00:08:59,406 --> 00:09:02,207
See ya, panda!
I'm on a mission.

167
00:09:02,209 --> 00:09:04,543
Got a lot to do.
[chuckling]

168
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:09,548
Wowee!
It's beautiful here.

169
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:12,784
Merryland is such
a wonderful place.

170
00:09:12,786 --> 00:09:14,419
[laughing]

171
00:09:14,421 --> 00:09:16,188
Hey, there.

172
00:09:16,757 --> 00:09:18,724
Huh?

173
00:09:22,263 --> 00:09:25,364
Oh, well, hi.

174
00:09:25,366 --> 00:09:26,832
[heavy footsteps approaching]

175
00:09:26,834 --> 00:09:29,434
What's that?
Oh, hey.

176
00:09:32,206 --> 00:09:34,907
How's it goin', guys?
Hey, ah...

177
00:09:34,909 --> 00:09:38,410
- [swords swinging]
- [Patrick groaning]

178
00:09:45,819 --> 00:09:48,921
[bouncing sounds mixed
with sword sounds]

179
00:09:52,927 --> 00:09:54,893
- [cats] Hee-ya!
- Not again!

180
00:09:54,895 --> 00:09:57,262
Help!

181
00:09:57,264 --> 00:10:00,799
Hiyah!

182
00:10:00,801 --> 00:10:02,901
[Patrick] Wow.
That was amazing,

183
00:10:02,903 --> 00:10:04,937
but why were they attacking me?

184
00:10:04,939 --> 00:10:08,240
The Phantom Army Cats
are all mind-controlled.

185
00:10:08,242 --> 00:10:10,442
- Phantom Army?
- Mmm-hmm.

186
00:10:10,444 --> 00:10:12,578
By the Evil Master.

187
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:14,246
What? But wait.

188
00:10:14,248 --> 00:10:16,215
I thought Merryland was
supposed to be a place

189
00:10:16,217 --> 00:10:17,716
of peace and harmony.

190
00:10:17,718 --> 00:10:19,952
It was many years ago.

191
00:10:19,954 --> 00:10:21,954
Why isn't it anymore?

192
00:10:21,956 --> 00:10:23,855
Unfortunately, most of Merryland

193
00:10:23,857 --> 00:10:25,824
is under the control
of the Evil Master.

194
00:10:25,826 --> 00:10:28,961
It's no longer the
paradise it once was.

195
00:10:28,963 --> 00:10:31,663
Isn't there anyone who
can defeat the Evil Master?

196
00:10:31,665 --> 00:10:33,565
No. No one has been able to.

197
00:10:33,567 --> 00:10:35,701
The only one who
can is a true hero.

198
00:10:35,703 --> 00:10:37,302
And who's that?

199
00:10:37,304 --> 00:10:39,972
The legendary Panda Warrior.

200
00:10:39,974 --> 00:10:41,907
Oh. Hmm.

201
00:10:41,909 --> 00:10:45,444
You may be a panda,
but you're certainly no warrior.

202
00:10:45,446 --> 00:10:46,778
Hmm.

203
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:49,281
That's what I've
been tryin' to tell ya.

204
00:10:49,283 --> 00:10:51,850
Hey! Not so fast!

205
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:55,287
Hey, where you goin'?

206
00:10:55,289 --> 00:10:57,656
Ah, oh, oh!

207
00:10:57,658 --> 00:11:00,859
[sighing] All right.
Why are you following me?

208
00:11:00,861 --> 00:11:02,894
Uh, well.

209
00:11:02,896 --> 00:11:04,896
I'm afraid the Phantom
Army will come back

210
00:11:04,898 --> 00:11:08,467
and you don't want me
joining up with them, do ya?

211
00:11:08,469 --> 00:11:09,635
[Peggy snorting]

212
00:11:09,637 --> 00:11:11,703
[Patrick chortling]

213
00:11:11,705 --> 00:11:13,505
I can tell you're a
really nice person.

214
00:11:13,507 --> 00:11:15,007
Otherwise, you wouldn't
have saved me, would ya?

215
00:11:15,009 --> 00:11:16,541
Huh? What else could I do?

216
00:11:16,543 --> 00:11:17,743
And I'm truly grateful for it.

217
00:11:17,745 --> 00:11:19,011
I mean, I don't know
what I would have done

218
00:11:19,013 --> 00:11:20,412
if you hadn't come along.

219
00:11:20,414 --> 00:11:22,481
Hey, knock it off, all right?

220
00:11:22,483 --> 00:11:23,582
And don't follow me.

221
00:11:23,584 --> 00:11:24,950
But...

222
00:11:28,022 --> 00:11:30,322
That's the Evil
Master's dark forest.

223
00:11:30,323 --> 00:11:32,623
Set one foot inside and his
army could easily find you.

224
00:11:32,626 --> 00:11:34,893
[shuddering]

225
00:11:35,996 --> 00:11:39,631
Hey, so we're not
goin' in there, right?

226
00:11:39,633 --> 00:11:41,833
When night falls, there'll
be many army patrols.

227
00:11:41,835 --> 00:11:44,636
It's a dangerous place,
especially for you.

228
00:11:44,638 --> 00:11:46,805
Just stay out here if
you want to be caught.

229
00:11:46,807 --> 00:11:48,540
Heeeyah!

230
00:11:48,542 --> 00:11:51,376
[Patrick] Hey, wait for me!

231
00:11:57,051 --> 00:11:59,851
[Patrick panting]

232
00:12:04,992 --> 00:12:08,894
- Hey, calm down, will ya?
- Who can be calm?

233
00:12:08,896 --> 00:12:11,596
Shhh! You have to be quiet.

234
00:12:11,598 --> 00:12:13,532
If you aren't careful,
the big monster,

235
00:12:13,534 --> 00:12:16,702
who lives here,
will find us, all right?

236
00:12:16,704 --> 00:12:18,070
There's a monster in here?

237
00:12:18,072 --> 00:12:19,805
[Peggy snorting]

238
00:12:19,807 --> 00:12:24,409
A big one, but you see,
no one who's ever seen it

239
00:12:24,411 --> 00:12:26,111
has ever returned alive.

240
00:12:26,113 --> 00:12:29,348
No survivors have ever returned
from the monster's clutches.

241
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:30,716
Now I'm really scared!

242
00:12:30,718 --> 00:12:31,850
[Peggy laughing]

243
00:12:31,852 --> 00:12:33,785
- Hey!
- Just kidding.

244
00:12:33,787 --> 00:12:35,120
You're pretty
gullible, aren't you?

245
00:12:35,122 --> 00:12:37,889
[Peggy laughing]

246
00:12:37,891 --> 00:12:42,027
Whoaaah!
Oh, no! Help!

247
00:12:42,029 --> 00:12:43,795
[spider growling]

248
00:12:43,797 --> 00:12:46,098
What is that scary thing?
That's a lot of teeth!

249
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:49,735
You think he's mad at
us for some reason?

250
00:12:52,439 --> 00:12:55,140
[spider growling]

251
00:12:55,142 --> 00:12:56,975
Oh, yeah? Ha!

252
00:12:56,977 --> 00:12:58,410
Yah!

253
00:12:58,412 --> 00:12:59,845
Hey, hey.

254
00:12:59,847 --> 00:13:02,114
Help! What's going on?

255
00:13:05,452 --> 00:13:08,687
Watch out, spider, here I come!

256
00:13:08,689 --> 00:13:11,523
Yah! Yah!

257
00:13:12,659 --> 00:13:14,960
Take that!

258
00:13:16,063 --> 00:13:18,397
Hey, wait.

259
00:13:23,437 --> 00:13:25,570
- Oh, no.
- Help!

260
00:13:25,572 --> 00:13:26,705
What're we going to do?

261
00:13:26,707 --> 00:13:28,140
I thought you had
this figured out.

262
00:13:28,142 --> 00:13:31,676
Be quiet! Unless you want
to be spider bait.

263
00:13:31,678 --> 00:13:33,145
We gotta get out of here.

264
00:13:33,147 --> 00:13:34,846
[Patrick] This is it!

265
00:13:34,848 --> 00:13:37,082
[Peggy farting]

266
00:13:38,852 --> 00:13:40,952
Huh?

267
00:13:44,625 --> 00:13:48,727
[Peggy making karate sounds]

268
00:13:48,729 --> 00:13:52,464
[wood clattering]

269
00:13:54,635 --> 00:13:56,168
Wow. That was amazing!

270
00:13:56,170 --> 00:13:57,736
You're awesome!

271
00:13:57,738 --> 00:13:59,604
Oh, hey, wait. Let me
help you with that.

272
00:13:59,606 --> 00:14:01,039
Starting a fire is
harder than it looks.

273
00:14:01,041 --> 00:14:01,973
Fine.

274
00:14:01,975 --> 00:14:03,875
[Patrick humming]

275
00:14:03,877 --> 00:14:06,845
- Need some help?
- I got this.

276
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:08,513
[Peggy sighing]

277
00:14:08,515 --> 00:14:10,949
- Here.
- I'm almost done.

278
00:14:10,951 --> 00:14:13,985
I think I got it.
I almost saw an ember.

279
00:14:16,924 --> 00:14:19,958
[Peggy laughing]

280
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,626
[click, then flames whooshing]

281
00:14:21,628 --> 00:14:23,228
Hey!

282
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:24,629
Wait, how'd you do that?

283
00:14:24,631 --> 00:14:25,797
[Peggy laughing]

284
00:14:25,799 --> 00:14:28,500
It's an invention
called a lighter.

285
00:14:28,502 --> 00:14:31,203
Amazing! You can make a fire
without hurting your paws.

286
00:14:31,205 --> 00:14:32,504
Mmm-hmm.

287
00:14:32,506 --> 00:14:34,072
Hey, let me take
a closer look at it.

288
00:14:34,074 --> 00:14:37,876
- Mmm-hmm.
- Cool, thanks.

289
00:14:38,846 --> 00:14:41,213
Whatever.

290
00:14:41,215 --> 00:14:43,515
Uh, how exactly
does this thing work?

291
00:14:43,517 --> 00:14:45,617
Here. Let me show you.

292
00:14:45,619 --> 00:14:47,752
[lighter sparking and exploding]

293
00:14:47,754 --> 00:14:49,087
I can't breathe.

294
00:14:49,089 --> 00:14:51,256
- [Patrick yelling]
- [Peggy coughing]

295
00:14:51,258 --> 00:14:54,159
[Patrick] It's dangerous to
play with fire. You OK?

296
00:14:54,161 --> 00:14:56,728
Yeah.

297
00:14:58,098 --> 00:15:00,832
It's pretty obvious you need to
take me with you on your journey.

298
00:15:00,834 --> 00:15:02,200
I'll fight the Evil Master, too.

299
00:15:02,202 --> 00:15:03,235
No!

300
00:15:03,237 --> 00:15:05,971
But you need some
help, don't you?

301
00:15:05,973 --> 00:15:08,273
- No way!
- Why not?

302
00:15:08,275 --> 00:15:09,708
I'll do whatever you want me to.

303
00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:10,942
Really?

304
00:15:10,944 --> 00:15:12,010
Sure, just ask.

305
00:15:12,012 --> 00:15:13,612
I'll do whatever you say.

306
00:15:13,614 --> 00:15:15,847
Hmm. All right.
Fine, then.

307
00:15:15,849 --> 00:15:17,983
In that case, go join
the Evil Master's side.

308
00:15:17,985 --> 00:15:20,619
- That'll help us out a lot.
- OK, got it.

309
00:15:20,621 --> 00:15:25,056
Uh... am I that useless?

310
00:15:25,058 --> 00:15:26,157
Yes!

311
00:15:26,159 --> 00:15:28,560
[Patrick sighing]

312
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:43,975
Hey.
Why do you wanna help?

313
00:15:43,977 --> 00:15:47,178
I wanna help because the
world's in chaos right now.

314
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:50,582
And I don't want
Merryland to be that way.

315
00:15:50,584 --> 00:15:53,985
The Merryland that I've heard of is
supposed to be a peaceful place.

316
00:15:53,987 --> 00:15:57,289
A place where everyone can
live in peace and harmony,

317
00:15:57,291 --> 00:16:00,759
and I wanna protect that peace.

318
00:16:00,761 --> 00:16:03,061
I'm on a mission.
I have to go.

319
00:16:03,063 --> 00:16:04,729
To spy on the Phantom Army.

320
00:16:04,731 --> 00:16:06,998
But I've no time to
take care of you.

321
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,634
I can take care of myself.
Don't you worry.

322
00:16:09,636 --> 00:16:12,304
I hope so. I can't be
responsible for your safety.

323
00:16:12,306 --> 00:16:15,106
Are you kidding? I'm a real
expert at being careful.

324
00:16:15,108 --> 00:16:17,008
I can take care of you, too.

325
00:16:17,010 --> 00:16:20,078
I'm good on my own. Taking care
of yourself is enough.

326
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:22,347
Really?
Then you'll let me come along?

327
00:16:22,349 --> 00:16:24,182
Mmm. It's not up to me.

328
00:16:24,184 --> 00:16:26,184
King Leo will make
the final decision.

329
00:16:26,186 --> 00:16:28,320
Oh, I love it.
I give you my word.

330
00:16:28,322 --> 00:16:29,621
I won't let you down.

331
00:16:29,623 --> 00:16:31,089
I won't ever let you...

332
00:16:31,091 --> 00:16:33,725
Whoa!

333
00:16:34,661 --> 00:16:36,061
[Peggy and Patrick groaning]

334
00:16:36,063 --> 00:16:41,933
- Sorry.
- Oh, man, I totally regret it already.

335
00:16:41,935 --> 00:16:45,070
Uh, you can't go
through life with regrets,

336
00:16:45,072 --> 00:16:47,772
but no more green gas!

337
00:16:50,377 --> 00:16:52,043
Hey, it's not fair.

338
00:16:52,045 --> 00:16:53,244
Pigs can eat whatever they want.

339
00:16:53,246 --> 00:16:54,913
I can only eat bamboo shoots.

340
00:16:54,915 --> 00:16:57,983
- Whatever.
- Boring, right?

341
00:16:57,985 --> 00:16:59,684
I'll tell you, Skyflyer...

342
00:16:59,686 --> 00:17:00,952
It's not safe here.

343
00:17:00,954 --> 00:17:02,887
- Run while you can.
- What's that?

344
00:17:02,889 --> 00:17:04,255
Are you talking in your sleep?

345
00:17:04,257 --> 00:17:06,958
Bet you're dreaming about
that spider fight, huh?

346
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:09,094
[whispering]
Run! Now!

347
00:17:09,096 --> 00:17:10,829
Once again,
you totally saved us.

348
00:17:10,831 --> 00:17:12,097
[whispering]
Quiet down.

349
00:17:12,099 --> 00:17:14,065
Well, I can't blame
you for resting.

350
00:17:14,067 --> 00:17:16,201
I'd take a break,
too, if I were you.

351
00:17:16,203 --> 00:17:17,902
[whispering]
I said, "Run."

352
00:17:17,904 --> 00:17:20,405
"Run?" What was that?
What d'you say? Hmm?

353
00:17:20,407 --> 00:17:22,974
I said, "Run,"
before it's too late.

354
00:17:22,976 --> 00:17:26,745
- [loud crashing noise]
- [yelling]

355
00:17:27,981 --> 00:17:31,316
Ah? The Dragon Necklace.

356
00:17:32,953 --> 00:17:34,719
Where did you get that necklace?

357
00:17:34,721 --> 00:17:36,688
- Huh?
- You heard me.

358
00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:39,124
- Start talking.
- It was my grandfather's.

359
00:17:39,126 --> 00:17:40,992
- A family heirloom.
- Stop talking!

360
00:17:40,994 --> 00:17:43,161
That is Princess
Angelica's necklace,

361
00:17:43,163 --> 00:17:44,729
your grandfather stole it.

362
00:17:44,731 --> 00:17:46,731
No, he didn't.
My grandpa's not a thief.

363
00:17:46,733 --> 00:17:49,434
He was. A thief never
admits his true nature.

364
00:17:49,436 --> 00:17:52,237
Your grandfather was a
slimy, stinking crook!

365
00:17:52,239 --> 00:17:54,873
How dare you insult my grandpa!

366
00:17:54,875 --> 00:17:56,141
[grunts]

367
00:17:56,143 --> 00:17:59,077
Now you will pay for
your grandfather's crime!

368
00:17:59,079 --> 00:18:03,248
[pincers singing like swords]

369
00:18:04,818 --> 00:18:06,985
No one insults my grandpa!

370
00:18:06,987 --> 00:18:08,319
Grrrr!

371
00:18:08,321 --> 00:18:12,090
[fighting]

372
00:18:28,775 --> 00:18:30,308
Take it back, right now.

373
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:34,079
No. I refuse to take
back a single word, panda.

374
00:18:34,081 --> 00:18:36,414
- Yah!
- Too slow!

375
00:18:36,416 --> 00:18:40,285
[fighting and yelling]

[pincer swords clanging]

378
00:18:49,396 --> 00:18:52,263
Hey, enough!

[grunting]

380
00:18:57,904 --> 00:19:00,205
I win!

381
00:19:00,207 --> 00:19:03,141
[heavy panting]

382
00:19:04,311 --> 00:19:08,146
[struggling noises]

383
00:19:08,148 --> 00:19:11,116
Now, why did you attack us?

384
00:19:11,118 --> 00:19:14,219
A real Kung Fu Master
refuses to be ambushed.

385
00:19:14,221 --> 00:19:16,221
Huh. Guess that
didn't work out for ya.

386
00:19:16,223 --> 00:19:17,956
You just wait, pig.

387
00:19:17,958 --> 00:19:19,491
I will defeat both of you.

388
00:19:19,493 --> 00:19:21,226
I demand that you untie me.

389
00:19:21,228 --> 00:19:23,795
Not a chance.
I don't trust ya.

390
00:19:23,797 --> 00:19:25,363
And you haven't apologized.

391
00:19:25,365 --> 00:19:27,432
You can leave me
here for an eternity,

392
00:19:27,434 --> 00:19:29,801
but I refuse to apologize.

393
00:19:29,803 --> 00:19:31,102
Now you did it.

394
00:19:31,104 --> 00:19:33,037
[Patrick huffing]

395
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:36,307
Just because you're big
doesn't mean you are mighty.

396
00:19:36,309 --> 00:19:41,212
Huh. Wha. Ohhh.

397
00:19:41,214 --> 00:19:43,014
Thank you.

398
00:19:43,016 --> 00:19:44,182
You can go.

399
00:19:44,184 --> 00:19:46,050
Uh, huh?

400
00:19:46,052 --> 00:19:48,219
You mean, you're releasing me?

401
00:19:48,221 --> 00:19:51,422
You know nothing
about my grandpa.

402
00:19:52,859 --> 00:19:54,159
Oh, all right.

403
00:19:54,161 --> 00:19:57,929
I apologize.
You happy?

404
00:20:00,467 --> 00:20:02,433
[Peggy snorting]

Hey!

409
00:20:13,313 --> 00:20:15,980
What's going on?
What'd you do that for?

410
00:20:15,982 --> 00:20:17,582
You're sure you're
not the Panda Warrior?

411
00:20:17,584 --> 00:20:20,885
Of course not. What did I do now
to make you think otherwise?

412
00:20:20,887 --> 00:20:22,487
Huh?

413
00:20:22,489 --> 00:20:24,289
- What are you doing?
- Shhhh.

414
00:20:24,291 --> 00:20:26,257

[creature whimpering]

417
00:20:48,315 --> 00:20:50,181
We're pretty close
to the onion village.

418
00:20:50,183 --> 00:20:53,284
It must have been taken
over by those soldiers.

419
00:20:53,286 --> 00:20:55,587
Wait! Try to stay calm.

420
00:20:55,589 --> 00:20:57,322
Let's see what we
can find out first.

421
00:20:57,324 --> 00:20:58,890
Right.

422
00:21:06,066 --> 00:21:11,236
[onions whimpering]

423
00:21:20,914 --> 00:21:24,148
Show him what happens
when you disobey.

424
00:21:28,521 --> 00:21:32,590
If you try to escape,
then you, too, will be punished.

425
00:21:32,592 --> 00:21:34,259
Enough. I can't just sit here

426
00:21:34,261 --> 00:21:36,327
while he bullies
those onion things.

427
00:21:36,329 --> 00:21:39,163
Don't risk it.
We're completely outnumbered.

428
00:21:39,165 --> 00:21:42,066
Weird onion animals or not,
it's inhuman.

429
00:21:42,068 --> 00:21:44,168
Who's human? I'm a pig.

430
00:21:44,170 --> 00:21:46,337
Hey.

431
00:21:50,510 --> 00:21:53,678
Here I come!

432
00:21:55,682 --> 00:21:58,583
That's my pig.

00:22:19,673 --> 00:22:21,272
Run, Patrick!

Whoa!

[laughing]

439
00:22:26,012 --> 00:22:28,513
He knows magic.
He must be a tree spirit.

440
00:22:28,515 --> 00:22:31,716
I am the one and
only Phantom Warrior.

441
00:22:31,718 --> 00:22:33,551
[Peggy snorts]
Yeah, big deal.

442
00:22:33,553 --> 00:22:35,954
I'm here to destroy
all evil forces.

443
00:22:35,956 --> 00:22:39,023

Well, we'll see about that.

Whoa! Ahhhh!

Take that! And that!

[grunting]

450
00:23:01,448 --> 00:23:03,047
It's the Mantis.

451
00:23:03,049 --> 00:23:06,284
What, does this little pipsqueak
want a piece of me, too?

452
00:23:06,286 --> 00:23:09,120
Hah. I may be
green, but I'm mean.

453
00:23:09,122 --> 00:23:11,289
I am a force to
be reckoned with.

Hmm. Course not.

463
00:23:38,485 --> 00:23:40,518
We all know who
the real fool is.

Now apologize to my grandpa!

You hear that, you mean tree?

470
00:23:58,104 --> 00:23:59,670

[Patrick] Sorry, I lost a little
bit there with the,

00:24:07,514 --> 00:24:09,781
you know, he was talkin'
smack about my grandpa.

[onion dogs yipping]

476
00:24:11,384 --> 00:24:13,418
So, what should we
do with him now?

477
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:14,752
Let's see.

478
00:24:14,754 --> 00:24:18,289
- Allow me to help you.
- Wow.

479
00:24:18,291 --> 00:24:20,558
Are you the legendary
Maestro Ginseng,

480
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:22,260
the Master of Sonic Arts?

481
00:24:22,262 --> 00:24:24,762
Yes, and I have
come here to help you.

482
00:24:24,764 --> 00:24:26,564
But you can just call me Jimmy.

483
00:24:26,566 --> 00:24:28,399
Oh, just Jimmy, huh?

484
00:24:28,401 --> 00:24:30,835
Sure. I thought you
always worked on your own.

485
00:24:30,837 --> 00:24:32,670
So, why would you
want to help us?

486
00:24:32,672 --> 00:24:34,505
Because from the
moment I saw you,

487
00:24:34,507 --> 00:24:35,840
I knew you were different.

488
00:24:35,842 --> 00:24:38,076
I think you could
save Merryland.

489
00:24:38,078 --> 00:24:41,813
That's why I've
decided to help you.

492
00:25:02,168 --> 00:25:04,635
Weird.

493
00:25:08,508 --> 00:25:10,541
Better.

494
00:25:10,543 --> 00:25:13,277
He is now cured.

495
00:25:18,718 --> 00:25:22,153
What is the meaning of this?
How did I end up here?

496
00:25:22,155 --> 00:25:23,888
You were taken over
by the Evil Master.

497
00:25:23,890 --> 00:25:25,690
But that root saved you.

498
00:25:25,692 --> 00:25:29,193
Rubbish! I am the one
and only Phantom Warrior.

499
00:25:29,195 --> 00:25:31,195
I can't be mind controlled.

500
00:25:31,197 --> 00:25:35,433
Oh, really?
I see. Interesting.

501
00:25:35,435 --> 00:25:38,436
So you meant to attack
the onion village, huh?

502
00:25:38,438 --> 00:25:39,871
No way!

503
00:25:39,873 --> 00:25:43,141
How dare the Evil Master take
control of my mind like that!

504
00:25:43,143 --> 00:25:46,210
I'm going to go find him
right now and take him down.

505
00:25:46,212 --> 00:25:48,813
Hold on!
If you could beat him,

506
00:25:48,815 --> 00:25:50,381
you wouldn't have
been mind-controlled.

507
00:25:50,383 --> 00:25:52,416
Enough. No insect bosses me.

508
00:25:52,418 --> 00:25:54,685
Jimmy, you freed
the crazy tree from

509
00:25:54,687 --> 00:25:56,654
the Evil Master's control.

510
00:25:56,656 --> 00:26:00,224
Could you free the
entire Phantom Army, too?

The Song of Peace.

513
00:26:04,497 --> 00:26:06,364
I need time to recover.

514
00:26:06,366 --> 00:26:07,899
I can't free them all.

515
00:26:07,901 --> 00:26:09,767
Well, that's weird,
but I understand.

516
00:26:09,769 --> 00:26:12,670
You've helped us
out a lot already.

517
00:26:12,672 --> 00:26:15,373
The Phantom Army will
eventually return here.

518
00:26:15,375 --> 00:26:19,343
You should go now.
Farewell, panda.

519
00:26:19,345 --> 00:26:23,381
Goodbye.
And thank you, Jimmy.

Thanks, Jimmy, for your magic.

Come on.

523
00:26:33,326 --> 00:26:35,259
Hey, how long will
it take to get

524
00:26:35,261 --> 00:26:36,661
to the Rainbow Hole?

525
00:26:36,663 --> 00:26:38,930
Long.

526
00:26:38,932 --> 00:26:40,932
I guess we better
move our onions.

527
00:26:40,934 --> 00:26:43,401
- Hey.
- What now?

528
00:26:43,403 --> 00:26:44,969
Company.

529
00:26:44,971 --> 00:26:46,938
Huh?

530
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:48,839
Uh-oh.

531
00:26:50,677 --> 00:26:52,944
Onions, take cover!

[bull snorting]

533
00:26:58,251 --> 00:26:59,450
Perfect timing.

534
00:26:59,452 --> 00:27:02,587
Saves us the trouble
of finding you.

535
00:27:02,589 --> 00:27:05,423
You guys somehow managed
to break the spell,

536
00:27:05,425 --> 00:27:07,992
which means that you must
be part of the rebellion.

537
00:27:07,994 --> 00:27:10,761
Enough threats.
How about a little fire?

538
00:27:10,763 --> 00:27:13,631
[fire whooshing]

539
00:27:17,303 --> 00:27:21,005
Patrick. That big ox just
insulted your grandpa.

540
00:27:21,007 --> 00:27:22,740
I didn't hear him say anything.

541
00:27:22,742 --> 00:27:24,442
Well, he was thinking it.

542
00:27:24,444 --> 00:27:26,444
How could you possibly
know what he's thinking?

543
00:27:26,446 --> 00:27:28,879
Hmm. I just know.

544
00:27:28,881 --> 00:27:30,815
Do you know what I'm
thinking right now?

545
00:27:30,817 --> 00:27:33,017
Hmm. How to escape?

546
00:27:33,019 --> 00:27:34,452
Well, I know where I'm going.

547
00:27:34,454 --> 00:27:35,886
Behind this bush over here.

548
00:27:35,888 --> 00:27:37,655
[Peggy growling]

549
00:27:37,657 --> 00:27:40,258
Let's attack together
and we'll overwhelm him.

550
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:42,593
Together? I'll do
just fine on my own.

551
00:27:42,595 --> 00:27:44,395
Huh?

552
00:27:44,397 --> 00:27:47,365
[Mantis shouting]

553
00:27:47,367 --> 00:27:49,533
Hiyah!

554
00:27:54,607 --> 00:27:57,675
Whaa!

555
00:27:57,677 --> 00:28:00,478
I am the Master!

556
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:02,980
Oh, look. What an
incredible insect he is.

557
00:28:02,982 --> 00:28:04,715
He's pretty cool.

558
00:28:04,717 --> 00:28:06,751
Ready? Bernie, Manny?

559
00:28:06,753 --> 00:28:08,019
Let's get him.

560
00:28:08,021 --> 00:28:10,354
Come on.

561
00:28:10,356 --> 00:28:12,556
[all yelling]

562
00:28:12,558 --> 00:28:15,826
Well, guys, let me know
how it all turns out.

563
00:28:21,801 --> 00:28:23,334
[rock shatters]

564
00:28:23,336 --> 00:28:25,036
[bull laughing]

565
00:28:25,038 --> 00:28:27,705
[bull straining]

566
00:28:28,875 --> 00:28:31,042
Metal beak to the rescue!

567
00:28:31,044 --> 00:28:32,643
Whaa-haa!

568
00:28:32,645 --> 00:28:34,912
[bird pecking rock]

569
00:28:34,914 --> 00:28:37,381
Ya-haa!

570
00:28:37,383 --> 00:28:39,517
Now, Billy!

571
00:28:39,519 --> 00:28:40,951
[grunts]

572
00:28:41,788 --> 00:28:44,555
[karate chopping sounds]

573
00:28:45,391 --> 00:28:46,891
Take that!

574
00:28:46,893 --> 00:28:48,592
[makes karate sounds]

575
00:28:49,796 --> 00:28:54,065
Here I come! High flyin'
Bobby Bunny at your service.

576
00:28:54,067 --> 00:28:55,533
Whoo hoo!

577
00:28:55,535 --> 00:28:56,667
Let's do this!

578
00:28:56,669 --> 00:28:58,102
And don't forget me.

579
00:28:58,104 --> 00:28:59,904
Yours truly, Shadowfeet.

580
00:28:59,906 --> 00:29:02,606
Great footwork,
but what the heck is he?

581
00:29:02,608 --> 00:29:06,844
I'm a river horse,
here to fight.

582
00:29:06,846 --> 00:29:09,980
- A hippo?
- Shadowfeet. You came, too?

583
00:29:09,982 --> 00:29:11,949
[Shadowfeet] Yes, indeed.

584
00:29:11,951 --> 00:29:14,685
Hey, look. It's GoGo Goat.

585
00:29:14,687 --> 00:29:16,654
[all gasping]

586
00:29:16,656 --> 00:29:18,656
Spinny the Monkey and GoGo Goat,

587
00:29:18,658 --> 00:29:19,857
you're all here!

588
00:29:19,859 --> 00:29:22,126
We're all together
again, at last.

589
00:29:22,128 --> 00:29:24,795
I'll destroy all of you!

590
00:29:24,797 --> 00:29:25,930
Ready?

591
00:29:25,932 --> 00:29:30,368
[all] Wonder
Seven battle array now!

592
00:29:30,370 --> 00:29:31,469
Bobby Bunny.

593
00:29:31,471 --> 00:29:32,937
I'm on it.

594
00:29:32,939 --> 00:29:35,673
[all yelling]

595
00:30:10,510 --> 00:30:13,944
[bull roaring]

596
00:30:13,946 --> 00:30:17,081
[explosion]

597
00:30:17,083 --> 00:30:19,784
Spinny's blaster does it again.

598
00:30:24,690 --> 00:30:26,624
- Out of my way!
- Oh, no.

599
00:30:26,626 --> 00:30:30,428
The Wonder Seven battle
array isn't powerful enough.

600
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:36,801
[all] Uh-oh.

601
00:30:36,803 --> 00:30:40,671
[bull groaning]

602
00:30:42,575 --> 00:30:44,708
You're goin' down, panda.

603
00:30:44,710 --> 00:30:46,710
Ole.

604
00:30:49,782 --> 00:30:51,916
O-later.

605
00:30:51,918 --> 00:30:54,718
[bull screaming]

606
00:31:02,662 --> 00:31:04,795
I'm Billy Beakman,
a trained metal beak.

607
00:31:04,797 --> 00:31:06,897
You saw how I broke
that huge rock, right?

608
00:31:06,899 --> 00:31:09,166
Yeah. That's a
pretty amazing skill.

609
00:31:09,168 --> 00:31:11,969
His biggest skill is talking
non-stop for three days.

610
00:31:11,971 --> 00:31:15,072
Ah, that's an old record.
I can manage five days now.

611
00:31:15,074 --> 00:31:18,209
Want me to share with you everything's
that's happened in those five days?

612
00:31:18,211 --> 00:31:20,578
Here. Fetch.

613
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:22,646
Yum.

614
00:31:22,648 --> 00:31:24,615
That's the only
way to shut him up.

615
00:31:24,617 --> 00:31:26,817
Come on.

616
00:31:26,819 --> 00:31:29,487
I'm high-flyin' Bobby
Bunny, at your service.

617
00:31:29,489 --> 00:31:30,554
Need to cool off?

618
00:31:30,556 --> 00:31:32,857
No, I'm fine. I'm fine!

619
00:31:32,859 --> 00:31:34,892
I'm fine.

620
00:31:37,163 --> 00:31:39,897
Hello, there.

621
00:31:40,867 --> 00:31:44,602
I'm Shadowfeet, a river horse.

622
00:31:45,271 --> 00:31:46,971
But, you're a hippo.

623
00:31:46,973 --> 00:31:50,140
Uh-uh.
No, I'm not.

624
00:31:50,142 --> 00:31:52,276
I am a river horse.

625
00:31:52,278 --> 00:31:54,979
You are a hippo.

626
00:31:54,981 --> 00:31:57,081
He just said that
he's a river horse.

627
00:31:57,083 --> 00:31:59,683
That's right.
I am a river horse,

628
00:31:59,685 --> 00:32:01,819
just like she said.

629
00:32:01,821 --> 00:32:03,854
Look, you say
you're a river horse

630
00:32:03,856 --> 00:32:05,723
and I wanna believe you,
but my eyes say...

631
00:32:05,725 --> 00:32:07,024
I think he's made
it quite clear that

632
00:32:07,026 --> 00:32:09,293
- he's a river horse.
- Yes, I have.

633
00:32:09,295 --> 00:32:11,862
Despite what you think you see,
I'm a river horse.

634
00:32:11,864 --> 00:32:14,031
Then I'm a bumblebee.
You're a hippo!

635
00:32:14,033 --> 00:32:15,866
I am not a hippo.

636
00:32:15,868 --> 00:32:18,969
I'm Shadowfeet,
the river horse, I tell ya.

637
00:32:18,971 --> 00:32:21,805
At least admit
you're a hippo horse.

638
00:32:21,807 --> 00:32:24,074
No. I am a river horse.

639
00:32:24,076 --> 00:32:27,545
I am not a hippo.
I am a river horse!

640
00:32:27,547 --> 00:32:28,779
Get it straight!

641
00:32:28,781 --> 00:32:30,214
All right, all right, whatever.

642
00:32:30,216 --> 00:32:32,917
You're a river horse, OK?
You crazy hippo.

643
00:32:32,919 --> 00:32:34,051
Are you happy now?

644
00:32:34,053 --> 00:32:35,886
[Shadowfeet]
Yes. That's better.

645
00:32:35,888 --> 00:32:39,023
[martial arts noises] I'm Bruce
Barkley, the canine crusader.

646
00:32:39,025 --> 00:32:40,190
Hello.

647
00:32:40,192 --> 00:32:42,259
[martial arts yelling]

648
00:32:44,163 --> 00:32:46,163
Ooh, that one hurt me.

649
00:32:46,165 --> 00:32:47,798
Below the belt.

650
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:50,634
Hmm. He'll feel that later.

651
00:32:50,636 --> 00:32:53,971
Hi. Mwah.

652
00:32:53,973 --> 00:32:56,974

[Patrick and GoGo Goat laughing]

654
00:32:59,979 --> 00:33:03,113
Hello, Patrick, how are you?

655
00:33:03,115 --> 00:33:06,016
Nice to meet you, GoGo Goat.

656
00:33:07,219 --> 00:33:10,154
You should try sleeping with
cucumber slices on your eyes.

657
00:33:10,156 --> 00:33:12,990
Really. Your patches
will vanish overnight.

658
00:33:12,992 --> 00:33:16,660
Trust me. It really works.

659
00:33:16,662 --> 00:33:18,362
Oh, thank you.

660
00:33:18,364 --> 00:33:20,631
[both giggle]

661
00:33:20,633 --> 00:33:22,866
This is Spinny,
the genius monkey.

662
00:33:22,868 --> 00:33:24,735
He's a brainiac from Merryland.

663
00:33:24,737 --> 00:33:27,071
He invented every one
of the weapons I use.

664
00:33:27,073 --> 00:33:29,056
- Hello.
- Hello.

665
00:33:29,057 --> 00:33:31,040
I just got to say I really
admire all your work.

666
00:33:31,043 --> 00:33:34,144
- [electrical buzzing]
- [yelling]

667
00:33:36,215 --> 00:33:39,016
Hmm. The power
isn't strong enough.

668
00:33:39,018 --> 00:33:41,952
I'll have to go back to
my lab and increase it.

669
00:33:41,954 --> 00:33:45,289
I take everything
I said about him back.

670
00:33:45,291 --> 00:33:47,725
Together, we're
known as the Rebellion.

671
00:33:47,727 --> 00:33:52,296
[all] The Rebellion
of the Seven Wonders!

672
00:33:52,298 --> 00:33:55,099
Even if we all
can't be geniuses, we're strong.

673
00:33:55,101 --> 00:33:57,234
[all] Hmm? Mm...

674
00:33:58,371 --> 00:34:00,838
[Peggy]
Hello, everyone. We're back.

675
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:03,974
I brought my friends,
and Patrick the Panda.

676
00:34:03,976 --> 00:34:06,744
[overlapping voices saying "Hi"]

677
00:34:06,746 --> 00:34:08,846
We can find out if he's
the Panda Warrior or not

678
00:34:08,848 --> 00:34:11,715
when we bring him
to meet King Leo.

679
00:34:11,717 --> 00:34:14,385
He'll know for sure
if he's the one.

680
00:34:14,387 --> 00:34:17,154
So, I take it you
have roots here?

681
00:34:17,156 --> 00:34:18,288
Mmm-hmm.

682
00:34:18,290 --> 00:34:19,723
Where are your defense forces?

683
00:34:19,725 --> 00:34:20,858
They're all here.

684
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:22,726
- Just the seven of you?
- Mmm-hmm.

685
00:34:22,728 --> 00:34:24,728
Well, that's more
than sufficient.

686
00:34:24,730 --> 00:34:27,731
We are the best seven wonders.
Never mind the others.

687
00:34:27,733 --> 00:34:30,167
No matter who the enemy is,
whether they're the Phantom Army

688
00:34:30,169 --> 00:34:32,936
or their Evil Master,
I can K.O. them in round one

689
00:34:32,938 --> 00:34:35,272
with one talon tied
behind my tail.

690
00:34:35,274 --> 00:34:36,807
- Mm.
- Mm-hmm.

691
00:34:36,809 --> 00:34:38,809
Fetch.

692
00:34:38,811 --> 00:34:42,279
He is big and round
and black and white.

693
00:34:42,281 --> 00:34:45,049
You're the Panda
Warrior, aren't you?

694
00:34:45,051 --> 00:34:47,384
Oh, no. That's not me.

695
00:34:47,386 --> 00:34:48,686
I'm very flattered, though.

696
00:34:48,688 --> 00:34:50,120
It's just like the legend said.

697
00:34:50,122 --> 00:34:52,756
He's big, fat, black and white.

698
00:34:52,758 --> 00:34:56,860
[bleating] It's real nice
to meet you, Panda Warrior.

699
00:34:56,862 --> 00:34:58,228
But you see, I'm not.

700
00:34:58,230 --> 00:35:00,431
Got to hurry.

701
00:35:00,433 --> 00:35:05,002
I need to report to King Leo.

702
00:35:05,905 --> 00:35:07,871
[all] Your majesty.

703
00:35:07,873 --> 00:35:10,774
Greetings.

704
00:35:12,278 --> 00:35:15,946
King Leo, we're back, and these are my
brave friends who have come here with me

705
00:35:15,948 --> 00:35:17,481
because they want
to join our team,

706
00:35:17,483 --> 00:35:19,917
and this is Patrick Panda.

707
00:35:19,919 --> 00:35:22,352
He's wearing the
ancient Dragon Necklace.

708
00:35:22,354 --> 00:35:25,055
Maybe he is the
legendary Panda Warrior,

709
00:35:25,057 --> 00:35:27,091
but that remains to be seen.

710
00:35:27,093 --> 00:35:30,327
[Shadowfeet] Look, the
necklace is glowing!

711
00:35:30,329 --> 00:35:33,497
[all murmuring]

712
00:35:33,499 --> 00:35:37,267
[Necklace shimmering
and ringing]

713
00:35:37,269 --> 00:35:40,337
This is indeed
the Dragon Necklace.

714
00:35:40,339 --> 00:35:42,840
[voices overlapping
with "Hooray"]

715
00:35:42,842 --> 00:35:47,111
Like I told you,
he is the Panda Warrior.

716
00:35:47,113 --> 00:35:50,848
[sighs] He is not the
legendary Panda Warrior.

717
00:35:50,850 --> 00:35:53,016
- [everyone sighing]
- Oh, dear.

718
00:35:53,018 --> 00:35:54,284
That's what I said.

719
00:35:54,286 --> 00:35:56,954
How could a coward
be the Panda Warrior?

720
00:35:56,956 --> 00:35:58,989
The Panda Warrior should
be strong and brave,

721
00:35:58,991 --> 00:36:00,290
just like me.

722
00:36:00,292 --> 00:36:01,925
Here, fetch!

723
00:36:01,927 --> 00:36:02,993
Go, go, go, go, go!

724
00:36:02,995 --> 00:36:05,496
[everyone sighing]

725
00:36:05,498 --> 00:36:08,031
[King Leo] You're all tired
after your long journey.

726
00:36:08,033 --> 00:36:10,234
Let us rest first.

727
00:36:24,984 --> 00:36:27,501
[Patrick]
<i>Ah, Grandpa.</i>

728
00:36:27,502 --> 00:36:30,019
<i>Why isn't Merryland the
way you described it?</i>

729
00:36:30,022 --> 00:36:32,289
The world changes
every single day

730
00:36:32,291 --> 00:36:35,392
and Merryland is no exception
to that rule, Patrick.

731
00:36:35,394 --> 00:36:36,794
Is that true?

732
00:36:36,796 --> 00:36:37,828
Mmm-hmm.

733
00:36:37,830 --> 00:36:38,929
Five years ago,

734
00:36:38,931 --> 00:36:41,532
a terrible disaster
befell Merryland.

735
00:36:41,534 --> 00:36:43,801
First, an animal that
I had never seen before

736
00:36:43,803 --> 00:36:46,136
suddenly appeared
here to rescue us.

737
00:36:46,138 --> 00:36:48,138
The legendary Panda Warrior?

738
00:36:48,140 --> 00:36:50,207
[King Leo] Yes.

739
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:52,275
<i>You see, the Dragon Ball
of Light powers Merryland</i>

740
00:36:52,278 --> 00:36:55,112
<i>and it used to also
maintain the peace.</i>

741
00:36:55,114 --> 00:36:58,048
<i>It was guarded by
Hope and Faith,</i>

742
00:36:58,050 --> 00:36:59,883
<i>the two heavenly whales,</i>

743
00:36:59,885 --> 00:37:03,020
<i>until one day when Hope
absorbed far too much power</i>

744
00:37:03,022 --> 00:37:04,822
<i>from the Dragon Ball.</i>

745
00:37:04,824 --> 00:37:06,557
The poor creature lost its mind

746
00:37:06,559 --> 00:37:09,560
<i>and suddenly began
destroying Merryland.</i>

747
00:37:09,562 --> 00:37:11,995
<i>It was then that the
legendary Panda Warrior</i>

748
00:37:11,997 --> 00:37:14,131
<i>came down from the heavens.</i>

749
00:37:14,133 --> 00:37:15,532
<i>He quickly defeated Hope,</i>

750
00:37:15,534 --> 00:37:18,202
<i>turning her back
to her normal self,</i>

751
00:37:18,204 --> 00:37:20,404
<i>restoring peace to Merryland.</i>

752
00:37:20,406 --> 00:37:23,173
<i>To show her appreciation
for his bravery,</i>

753
00:37:23,175 --> 00:37:26,910
<i>Princess Angelica presented
him with the Dragon Necklace.</i>

754
00:37:26,912 --> 00:37:30,113
<i>Then the Panda Warrior
returned to his own world,</i>

755
00:37:30,115 --> 00:37:33,317
<i>with the magical
Dragon Necklace,</i>

756
00:37:33,319 --> 00:37:34,985
<i>but during the ceremony,</i>

757
00:37:34,987 --> 00:37:37,454
<i>a despicable rat
with a despicable plan</i>

758
00:37:37,456 --> 00:37:38,856
<i>snuck into Merryland</i>

759
00:37:38,858 --> 00:37:41,024
<i>from an evil parallel dimension.</i>

760
00:37:41,026 --> 00:37:42,292
<i>Using</i> his dark magic,

761
00:37:42,294 --> 00:37:44,494
<i>he merged Hope and
himself into one,</i>

762
00:37:44,496 --> 00:37:47,431
<i>declaring himself the Evil
Master of all Merryland,</i>

763
00:37:47,433 --> 00:37:51,468
<i>transforming himself into a
terrifying nine-headed snake.</i>

764
00:37:51,470 --> 00:37:54,638
<i>He was too powerful
for anyone to resist.</i>

765
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:56,607
<i>He destroyed everyone
who disobeyed him</i>

766
00:37:56,609 --> 00:38:00,110
<i>and then, he took Princess
Angelica prisoner.</i>

767
00:38:00,112 --> 00:38:02,446
<i>Most of Merryland's
citizens were bewitched</i>

768
00:38:02,448 --> 00:38:05,549
<i>and forced to form
his Phantom Army.</i>

769
00:38:05,551 --> 00:38:09,653
So, you can see how
desperate everyone of us are,

770
00:38:09,655 --> 00:38:12,289
for the Panda Warrior
to come back

771
00:38:12,291 --> 00:38:15,325
and rescue us, as he did before.

772
00:38:15,327 --> 00:38:19,630
I'm sorry. I wish I was the
Panda Warrior, but I'm not.

773
00:38:19,632 --> 00:38:23,400
Patrick, Panda Warrior is nothing
more than a mythical name.

774
00:38:23,402 --> 00:38:25,636
Whoever has faith and courage

775
00:38:25,638 --> 00:38:28,305
is the true
Panda Warrior of legend.

776
00:38:28,307 --> 00:38:33,243
But sir, I'm nothing
more than a useless coward.

777
00:38:33,245 --> 00:38:35,078
Don't you know there's
no one in the world

778
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:38,115
who could look down
upon you than yourself.

779
00:38:38,117 --> 00:38:41,251
Our only hope lies in the
return of the long-awaited

780
00:38:41,253 --> 00:38:43,453
Panda Warrior, Jin Long.

781
00:38:43,455 --> 00:38:44,688
Grandpa?

782
00:38:44,690 --> 00:38:46,189
[King Leo laughing]

783
00:38:46,191 --> 00:38:47,524
You are his descendant?

784
00:38:47,526 --> 00:38:51,228
- I see.
- Huh? Wait a minute.

785
00:38:51,230 --> 00:38:53,230
The Panda Warrior
came and rescued you

786
00:38:53,232 --> 00:38:54,998
five years ago, right?

787
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:58,402
But by then, my grandpa
had already passed away.

788
00:38:58,404 --> 00:39:00,437
He can't be your Panda Warrior.

789
00:39:00,439 --> 00:39:02,139
I heard from Princess Angelica

790
00:39:02,141 --> 00:39:04,274
the time in Merryland
moves differently

791
00:39:04,276 --> 00:39:05,409
than the outside world,

792
00:39:05,411 --> 00:39:07,544
so the timing makes
perfect sense.

793
00:39:07,546 --> 00:39:10,647
It appears to me that
your Dragon Necklace

794
00:39:10,649 --> 00:39:14,017
is the strongest
evidence of that.

795
00:39:14,987 --> 00:39:17,187
Your grandfather
giving you the necklace

796
00:39:17,189 --> 00:39:20,324
and your arrival
here at this time

797
00:39:20,326 --> 00:39:23,126
is more than a coincidence.

798
00:39:26,131 --> 00:39:29,499
That is something to
consider, Patrick.

799
00:39:38,077 --> 00:39:42,179
Well, I'm convinced my grandfather
was the Panda Warrior

800
00:39:42,181 --> 00:39:44,081
And I must keep his reputation,

801
00:39:44,083 --> 00:39:45,716
and so I will help
you save Merryland

802
00:39:45,718 --> 00:39:47,250
from the Evil Master.

803
00:39:47,252 --> 00:39:49,286
Huh? What do you mean,
you'll help?

804
00:39:49,288 --> 00:39:50,754
Is this some kind of a joke?

805
00:39:50,756 --> 00:39:52,723
And how is it that you suddenly

806
00:39:52,725 --> 00:39:55,192
believe that you
can save Merryland?

807
00:39:55,194 --> 00:39:58,128
I found my courage and passion.

808
00:39:59,999 --> 00:40:02,199
All right, then, prove it to me.

809
00:40:03,202 --> 00:40:06,103
[grunting]

810
00:40:06,105 --> 00:40:08,572
[Patrick groaning]

811
00:40:13,245 --> 00:40:14,411
Why, I oughta...

812
00:40:14,413 --> 00:40:17,014
[groaning]

813
00:40:19,518 --> 00:40:21,618
OK.

814
00:40:21,620 --> 00:40:24,388
So, that is your
courage and passion?

815
00:40:24,390 --> 00:40:27,758
Hiiiiiyaaaa...

816
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:30,260
[roaring]

817
00:40:30,262 --> 00:40:33,263
[Patrick groaning]

818
00:40:33,265 --> 00:40:35,632
I'll never give up.

819
00:40:35,634 --> 00:40:40,137
[Patrick groaning]

820
00:40:42,374 --> 00:40:46,476
Ah. Give up now.

821
00:40:47,413 --> 00:40:50,347
I'll never, ever give up.

822
00:40:50,349 --> 00:40:52,115
Then catch me.

823
00:40:52,117 --> 00:40:54,785
[King Leo chortling, groaning]

824
00:40:54,787 --> 00:41:00,223
If you can't even beat me, how is it
that you expect to beat the Evil Master?

825
00:41:00,225 --> 00:41:03,593
I understand, so please, King
Leo, train me to defeat him.

826
00:41:03,595 --> 00:41:05,262
You think you have
the courage it takes

827
00:41:05,264 --> 00:41:06,530
to become a warrior?

828
00:41:06,532 --> 00:41:09,499
- I do.
- Very well.

829
00:41:09,501 --> 00:41:12,836
In that case,
I will train you, Patrick.

830
00:41:12,838 --> 00:41:15,572
- Yes!
- You all train yourselves, understood?

831
00:41:15,574 --> 00:41:18,141
[all] Yes, sir.

832
00:41:24,683 --> 00:41:28,618
[birds chirping]

833
00:41:30,422 --> 00:41:34,691
[fish jumping out of water]

834
00:41:34,693 --> 00:41:37,494
Wow, what a wonderful place.

835
00:41:37,496 --> 00:41:39,696
Doubt you'll be
saying that later.

836
00:41:39,698 --> 00:41:40,831
[King Leo laughing]

837
00:41:40,833 --> 00:41:43,100
Oh. I should have figured.

838
00:41:43,102 --> 00:41:45,769
Your first training task
is to use these lilies

839
00:41:45,771 --> 00:41:47,471
to jump across the river.

840
00:41:47,473 --> 00:41:49,172
Sounds simple enough.

841
00:41:49,174 --> 00:41:52,809
- You really think so?
- Haha. Yeah, sure.

842
00:41:52,811 --> 00:41:55,345
[stretching]

843
00:41:57,716 --> 00:42:01,585
[Patrick humming]

844
00:42:01,587 --> 00:42:04,754
I hope your other tasks
are tougher than this!

845
00:42:05,657 --> 00:42:08,158
[Patrick groaning]

846
00:42:10,529 --> 00:42:13,497
Whoa. Whoa!

847
00:42:13,499 --> 00:42:14,865
These flowers have teeth!

848
00:42:14,867 --> 00:42:17,734
Oh, didn't I warn you?
Sorry. My bad.

849
00:42:17,736 --> 00:42:20,403
They're piranha flowers
and they're hungry,

850
00:42:20,405 --> 00:42:21,905
so be careful to not
become their lunch.

851
00:42:21,907 --> 00:42:23,907
Hey, what kind of
training is this?

852
00:42:23,909 --> 00:42:25,475
Trying to get me eaten alive?

853
00:42:25,477 --> 00:42:27,244
You'll have to
manage on your own,

854
00:42:27,246 --> 00:42:29,579
or it wouldn't be
training, now would it?

855
00:42:29,581 --> 00:42:30,881
And one more thing.

856
00:42:30,883 --> 00:42:32,916
These lilies have
a surprise inside.

857
00:42:32,918 --> 00:42:34,818
What are you talking about?

858
00:42:35,354 --> 00:42:37,821
[all gasping]

859
00:42:40,259 --> 00:42:41,291
Uh-oh.

860
00:42:41,293 --> 00:42:43,793
Don't look, GoGo.

861
00:42:44,830 --> 00:42:47,230
Ah, my tail!

862
00:42:47,232 --> 00:42:50,634
Let go of my tail!

863
00:42:55,507 --> 00:42:57,507
[yells]

864
00:42:57,509 --> 00:43:00,210
Huh?
The lake is so shallow.

865
00:43:00,212 --> 00:43:01,611
I don't need to
jump to get across.

866
00:43:01,613 --> 00:43:02,879
I can just walk.

867
00:43:02,881 --> 00:43:04,781
Yeah, well,
if I were you, I'd run!

868
00:43:04,783 --> 00:43:06,650
Give me one good reason.

869
00:43:06,652 --> 00:43:09,386
Uh, this lake is
full of piranha fish.

870
00:43:09,388 --> 00:43:10,720
That's one.

871
00:43:10,722 --> 00:43:13,657
[Peggy] I said,
"Run." Go Panda, go!

872
00:43:13,659 --> 00:43:14,958
I finished. I passed.

873
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:16,893
Sorry, you failed the test,

874
00:43:16,895 --> 00:43:19,196
unless you complete it
without getting wet.

875
00:43:19,198 --> 00:43:20,363
Huh?

876
00:43:20,365 --> 00:43:21,331
Again!

877
00:43:21,333 --> 00:43:22,799
[splashing]

878
00:43:22,801 --> 00:43:24,334
Ooh, ooh, aah!

879
00:43:24,336 --> 00:43:26,536
This water hurts!

880
00:43:26,538 --> 00:43:29,873
[waterfall sounds]

881
00:43:33,545 --> 00:43:36,546
So, your majesty, what exactly do
you have in store for me next?

882
00:43:36,548 --> 00:43:38,748
- [King Leo] Look there.
- Yah!

883
00:43:38,750 --> 00:43:40,884
What, more water?

884
00:43:40,886 --> 00:43:43,253
A piranha lake and
now a piranha river?

885
00:43:43,255 --> 00:43:47,991
Don't worry, there are no fish
to be afraid of in this river.

886
00:43:47,993 --> 00:43:50,227
This time it's extremely simple.

887
00:43:50,229 --> 00:43:53,763
All you need to do is fill
the two buckets with water.

888
00:43:53,765 --> 00:43:55,465
And that's all there is to it?

889
00:43:55,467 --> 00:43:57,801
Well, not exactly.

890
00:43:57,803 --> 00:43:59,569
[Patrick groaning]

891
00:43:59,571 --> 00:44:02,505
I knew it couldn't be that easy.

892
00:44:07,813 --> 00:44:11,514
[Patrick groaning]

893
00:44:21,393 --> 00:44:23,560
I got this one.

894
00:44:24,863 --> 00:44:26,663
[splashing]

895
00:44:26,665 --> 00:44:28,598
No! Not again!

896
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:30,600
This one is a
bit more dangerous.

897
00:44:30,602 --> 00:44:32,269
- Peggy Skyflyer?
- Huh?

898
00:44:32,271 --> 00:44:33,670
[King Leo] Please demonstrate.

899
00:44:33,672 --> 00:44:36,740
Uh, yes, sire.

900
00:44:37,609 --> 00:44:41,011
[bamboo whizzing by]

901
00:44:41,013 --> 00:44:45,882
[Peggy grunting]

902
00:44:45,884 --> 00:44:47,684
Whaaaa!

903
00:44:50,522 --> 00:44:51,621
Huh?

904
00:44:51,623 --> 00:44:52,856
[Peggy farting]

905
00:44:52,858 --> 00:44:57,694
[Peggy yelling]

906
00:44:57,696 --> 00:45:00,530
[all cheering]

907
00:45:01,300 --> 00:45:03,667
Now, it's your turn.

908
00:45:03,669 --> 00:45:05,435
OK.

909
00:45:07,673 --> 00:45:10,707
[chomping loudly]

910
00:45:14,046 --> 00:45:17,414
[King Leo] The world
certainly is full of surprises.

911
00:45:17,416 --> 00:45:21,318
Patrick, you truly
are the chosen one.

912
00:45:23,388 --> 00:45:28,591
[groaning and hissing]

913
00:45:31,029 --> 00:45:33,963
You can keep me here,
but the citizens of Merryland

914
00:45:33,965 --> 00:45:35,665
must not be hurt.

915
00:45:35,667 --> 00:45:38,802
You are a creature
born of the Dragon Ball

916
00:45:38,804 --> 00:45:40,403
and when you are gone,

917
00:45:40,405 --> 00:45:42,672
the Dragon Ball will disappear.

918
00:45:42,674 --> 00:45:45,575
I will not be tricked by you.

919
00:45:46,611 --> 00:45:48,011
What do you want?

920
00:45:48,013 --> 00:45:49,779
You shall see.

921
00:45:49,781 --> 00:45:54,517
The poison water will drain away
the goodness in your heart.

922
00:45:54,519 --> 00:45:57,020
When the Dragon Ball is
drained of its goodness

923
00:45:57,022 --> 00:46:01,458
and finally turns dark and evil,
I will absorb its energy

924
00:46:01,460 --> 00:46:04,961
and become more powerful
than you can imagine.

925
00:46:04,963 --> 00:46:08,698
When that day arrives,
nothing will be able to stop me.

926
00:46:08,700 --> 00:46:13,370
I'll conquer Merryland first and
move on to the rest of your world.

927
00:46:13,372 --> 00:46:15,739
The Panda Warrior's
coming back for you.

928
00:46:15,741 --> 00:46:19,476
I think not, Princess Angelica.

929
00:46:19,478 --> 00:46:21,978
Even your previous
Panda Warrior would find it

930
00:46:21,980 --> 00:46:25,448
next to impossible
to defeat me now.

931
00:46:25,450 --> 00:46:28,785
I still have faith that the panda
will come and save us all.

932
00:46:28,787 --> 00:46:30,553
That's because you have no idea

933
00:46:30,555 --> 00:46:32,389
of the ways of the world.

934
00:46:32,391 --> 00:46:35,925
Your fate lies here, Princess.

935
00:46:40,899 --> 00:46:45,068
[King Leo] <i>Patrick, now you understand
the challenges of the world.</i>

936
00:46:45,070 --> 00:46:48,104
Always treasure
your Dragon Necklace.

937
00:46:48,106 --> 00:46:49,606
Hold on to it.

938
00:46:49,608 --> 00:46:52,675
In your most desperate moment,
call upon its power,

939
00:46:52,677 --> 00:46:54,611
and use it to save yourself.

940
00:46:54,613 --> 00:46:56,646
You have earned
your magical sword.

941
00:46:56,648 --> 00:47:01,418
I sincerely hope you can help us defeat
the Evil Master and save Merryland.

942
00:47:01,420 --> 00:47:03,119
I will do my best.

943
00:47:05,891 --> 00:47:07,524
Wait just a minute.

944
00:47:07,526 --> 00:47:10,693
We can't let him be the leader
just because of his grandpa.

945
00:47:10,695 --> 00:47:12,695
I object!
[grunts]

946
00:47:12,697 --> 00:47:14,497
What do you suggest we do then?

947
00:47:14,499 --> 00:47:17,534
I challenge him
to be the leader.

948
00:47:17,536 --> 00:47:20,170
Patrick, do you
accept the challenge?

949
00:47:20,172 --> 00:47:22,539
We should unite to
fight the Evil Master,

950
00:47:22,541 --> 00:47:23,773
not fight each other.

951
00:47:23,775 --> 00:47:25,475
What if I lose or get
hurt or something?

952
00:47:25,477 --> 00:47:28,077
Hah. That's because
you know I'll defeat you.

953
00:47:28,079 --> 00:47:30,914
Maybe so, but if you really
want a challenge,

954
00:47:30,916 --> 00:47:33,450
let's see who can defeat
the Evil Master first?

955
00:47:33,452 --> 00:47:34,684
Right. You're on!

956
00:47:34,686 --> 00:47:36,920
But you're gonna lose.

957
00:47:42,527 --> 00:47:45,094
[all cheering]

958
00:47:47,065 --> 00:47:51,668
The Evil Master lives
in a floating castle.

959
00:47:51,670 --> 00:47:54,170
Unfortunately, it has
no fixed location,

960
00:47:54,172 --> 00:47:55,939
so it's impossible
to know where it is

961
00:47:55,941 --> 00:47:57,674
at any given time.

962
00:47:57,676 --> 00:47:59,075
Oh, dear.
I don't want to spend

963
00:47:59,077 --> 00:48:02,245
the rest of my life searching
for some floating castle.

964
00:48:02,247 --> 00:48:04,814
What should we do, Patrick?

965
00:48:04,816 --> 00:48:07,717
My master, the Fox
Elder, is a magician.

966
00:48:07,719 --> 00:48:09,919
She might be able
to help us out.

967
00:48:09,921 --> 00:48:11,754
Then we should go and
find her right away.

968
00:48:11,756 --> 00:48:12,856
- [Peggy] Right. Huh?
- No!

969
00:48:12,858 --> 00:48:14,257
She doesn't trust anyone.

970
00:48:14,259 --> 00:48:18,027
Except for maybe
the Panda Warrior.

971
00:48:18,029 --> 00:48:21,164
Huh?

972
00:48:24,536 --> 00:48:26,236
Listen carefully.

973
00:48:26,238 --> 00:48:29,105
This is a piece of the floating
castle's foundation stone.

974
00:48:29,107 --> 00:48:32,809
It's very rare and contains
mysterious magical powers.

975
00:48:32,811 --> 00:48:36,145
Take it with you and it will lead
you to the castle's location.

976
00:48:36,147 --> 00:48:39,916
Yeah! This is going to be
lights-out for the Evil Master.

977
00:48:39,918 --> 00:48:41,751
[grunts]

978
00:48:41,752 --> 00:48:43,585
And take this. It has
a special note inside.

979
00:48:43,588 --> 00:48:45,755
Open it if you should
ever find yourself

980
00:48:45,757 --> 00:48:47,757
in terrible danger.

981
00:48:47,759 --> 00:48:49,792
Understand?

982
00:48:52,998 --> 00:48:54,731
Yes, Fox Elder.

983
00:48:54,733 --> 00:48:56,599
[Patrick] Thank you
for your guidance, ma'am.

984
00:48:56,601 --> 00:48:57,967
[Fox Elder] You're welcome.

985
00:48:57,969 --> 00:49:00,837
Where are the Seven Wonders?
They should be here.

986
00:49:00,839 --> 00:49:02,005
[groans]

987
00:49:02,007 --> 00:49:03,273
Huh?

988
00:49:03,275 --> 00:49:05,542
I sure hope they're
not in danger.

989
00:49:05,544 --> 00:49:07,043
[GoGo Goat] Help me.

990
00:49:07,045 --> 00:49:09,212
Hi, GoGo Goat.
No, I wasn't scared.

991
00:49:09,214 --> 00:49:10,880
Are you all right?
Everything OK?

992
00:49:10,882 --> 00:49:12,181
[Bernie swatting reeds]

993
00:49:12,183 --> 00:49:15,018
I'm fine, but...
[crying]

994
00:49:15,020 --> 00:49:17,153
GoGo, what happened to everyone?

995
00:49:17,155 --> 00:49:21,624
It was awful.
The Phantom Army attacked us.

996
00:49:21,626 --> 00:49:23,660
Where's everyone else?

997
00:49:23,662 --> 00:49:25,094
I don't know.

998
00:49:25,096 --> 00:49:27,664
Bruce Barkley dug a
hole and hid me in it,

999
00:49:27,666 --> 00:49:30,600
but I'm afraid everyone
else may have been captured.

1000
00:49:30,602 --> 00:49:31,834
Oh, no.

1001
00:49:31,836 --> 00:49:34,637
Forget about finding
the Evil Master.

1002
00:49:34,639 --> 00:49:37,974
The others may be part
of the Phantom Army now.

1003
00:49:37,976 --> 00:49:39,909
GoGo, please don't give up.

1004
00:49:39,911 --> 00:49:41,678
Who else can save them, but us?

1005
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:43,112
We have to do it.

1006
00:49:43,114 --> 00:49:45,582
But first, we need to
find out where they are.

1007
00:49:45,584 --> 00:49:48,318
- I can't right now.
- But why?

1008
00:49:48,320 --> 00:49:50,653
Because I need to take a shower.

1009
00:49:50,655 --> 00:49:52,221
I'm all dirty from hiding.

1010
00:49:52,223 --> 00:49:55,592
I need to freshen up
before I can help out.

1011
00:49:55,594 --> 00:49:57,260
Uhh.

1012
00:50:05,003 --> 00:50:07,103
This way, guys.

1013
00:50:22,120 --> 00:50:24,253
Why don't you just
let me take them?

1014
00:50:24,255 --> 00:50:25,989
You can't.

1015
00:50:27,058 --> 00:50:28,791
Look over there.

1016
00:50:28,793 --> 00:50:30,893
[Bernie] Whoa!

1017
00:50:31,296 --> 00:50:33,062
[gasps]

1018
00:50:34,065 --> 00:50:36,966
All right, finally.

1019
00:50:44,709 --> 00:50:46,776
So how do we get all
the way up there?

1020
00:50:46,778 --> 00:50:50,313
If Peggy Skyflyer
was here, she'd know.

1021
00:50:50,315 --> 00:50:52,281
I have a plan.

1022
00:50:56,054 --> 00:50:57,420
Huh?

1023
00:50:57,422 --> 00:50:59,389
Your horn is nothing but a fake.

1024
00:50:59,391 --> 00:51:01,057
Fake is such a strong word.

1025
00:51:01,059 --> 00:51:03,926
Can't a girl have a
few beauty secrets?

1026
00:51:03,928 --> 00:51:05,795
Hah!

1027
00:51:07,399 --> 00:51:11,401
[all grunting]

1028
00:51:21,946 --> 00:51:25,715
- [knives flying]
- [yelping]

1029
00:51:26,785 --> 00:51:28,184
There she is!

1030
00:51:28,186 --> 00:51:29,919
Peggy Skyflyer, it's us!

1031
00:51:29,921 --> 00:51:33,756
Looks like she's been turned
into a Phantom Army soldier.

1032
00:51:33,758 --> 00:51:36,759
You dare to enter the
castle without permission?

1033
00:51:36,761 --> 00:51:38,895
You are all doomed!

1034
00:51:38,897 --> 00:51:42,999
[grunting]

1035
00:51:43,001 --> 00:51:47,704
[Bernie groaning]

1036
00:51:52,477 --> 00:51:56,212
Nice try, but your
little darts won't hurt me.

1037
00:51:56,214 --> 00:51:58,181
Huh. We'll see about that.

1038
00:51:58,183 --> 00:52:00,249
I'll inform the Phantom
General you're here

1039
00:52:00,251 --> 00:52:02,452
and we'll destroy you all!

1040
00:52:02,454 --> 00:52:04,821
[Peggy laughing]

1041
00:52:04,823 --> 00:52:06,756
Even when she's
under mind control,

1042
00:52:06,758 --> 00:52:08,725
she has no sense of direction.

1043
00:52:08,727 --> 00:52:09,892
Don't let her go.

1044
00:52:09,894 --> 00:52:11,027
We gotta capture her.

1045
00:52:11,029 --> 00:52:13,262
You got it.
How you want her cooked?

1046
00:52:13,264 --> 00:52:14,263
[Patrick] Don't hurt her.

1047
00:52:14,265 --> 00:52:15,932
Ah, you're no fun.

1048
00:52:15,934 --> 00:52:18,367
- [Bernie shouting]
- [Peggy groaning]

1049
00:52:18,369 --> 00:52:21,971
[yelps]
I gotcha.

1050
00:52:24,209 --> 00:52:26,342
This is going to hurt
me more than it hurts you.

1051
00:52:26,344 --> 00:52:27,777
[Patrick kicking Peggy]

1052
00:52:27,779 --> 00:52:30,046
[Peggy groaning]

1053
00:52:31,249 --> 00:52:32,982
I bet Manny Mantis
and the others

1054
00:52:32,984 --> 00:52:35,752
are bewitched and part of
the Phantom Army now, too.

1055
00:52:35,754 --> 00:52:38,354
Oh, no. I really don't
want to have to fight them.

1056
00:52:38,356 --> 00:52:42,191
The only way to save them is to
take down that nine-headed snake.

1057
00:52:42,193 --> 00:52:43,893
Yeah!

1058
00:52:44,929 --> 00:52:46,763
Let's go.

1059
00:52:54,239 --> 00:52:57,306
This castle is like a maze.
Which way should we go?

1060
00:52:57,308 --> 00:53:00,843
Just be sure to keep an eye out
for the nine-headed snake.

1061
00:53:00,845 --> 00:53:03,246
Follow me, guys. Though I have
not been here long,

1062
00:53:03,248 --> 00:53:04,981
I do know every
corner of the castle.

1063
00:53:04,983 --> 00:53:06,249
[all] Billy Beakman.

1064
00:53:06,251 --> 00:53:07,383
[Billy] At your service.

1065
00:53:07,385 --> 00:53:09,085
[all] Stay where you are.

1066
00:53:09,087 --> 00:53:11,087
What's happened to you all?

1067
00:53:11,089 --> 00:53:14,056
- Run!
- They're bewitched!

1068
00:53:16,461 --> 00:53:18,094
What do we do now?

1069
00:53:18,096 --> 00:53:21,063
[all yelling]

1070
00:53:21,866 --> 00:53:23,533
[gasps]
It's a dead end.

1071
00:53:23,535 --> 00:53:26,569
That's right.
We gotcha now.

1072
00:53:26,571 --> 00:53:29,472
Come on, Bruce.
Don't you remember us?

1073
00:53:29,474 --> 00:53:32,208
GoGo, you can join us, too.

1074
00:53:32,210 --> 00:53:35,845
I can't. You know I don't
like it when things get dirty.

1075
00:53:35,847 --> 00:53:38,881
I calculate we'll have
to do this the hard way.

1076
00:53:38,883 --> 00:53:41,284
[all grunting]

1077
00:53:42,287 --> 00:53:44,287
Looks like we're
gonna have to fight 'em.

1078
00:53:44,289 --> 00:53:46,589
We can't do that. Your magical
flames will harm them.

1079
00:53:46,591 --> 00:53:49,158
- We got no choice.
- They're mind-controlled.

1080
00:53:49,160 --> 00:53:51,027
- We can't hurt our friends.
- Watch out!

1081
00:53:51,029 --> 00:53:52,195
[Patrick groaning]

1082
00:53:52,197 --> 00:53:54,564
[thumps to the ground]

1083
00:53:54,566 --> 00:53:57,433
[Bull laughing]

1084
00:53:57,435 --> 00:54:01,103
Well, well, well.
I have you now.

1085
00:54:01,105 --> 00:54:03,072
And you're all mine.

1086
00:54:03,074 --> 00:54:05,241
I'm gonna barbecue
you, you big rump roast.

1087
00:54:05,243 --> 00:54:07,143
How dare you! Quiet!

1088
00:54:07,145 --> 00:54:09,912
If you aren't careful,
I'll chop you into firewood.

1089
00:54:09,914 --> 00:54:11,314
No, you won't.

1090
00:54:11,316 --> 00:54:14,016
Hiyah!

1091
00:54:15,420 --> 00:54:16,619
Are you trying to rebel?

1092
00:54:16,621 --> 00:54:20,323
No, not rebel. Return!

1093
00:54:20,325 --> 00:54:24,160
Wait. But I thought that...
you were bewitched.

1094
00:54:24,162 --> 00:54:27,597
[laughing] Well, you thought
wrong, didn't you, Crusher?

1095
00:54:27,599 --> 00:54:29,465
Let's get you back
to your old self.

1096
00:54:29,467 --> 00:54:33,169
Patrick, grab the
bull by the horns! Ha-ha!

1097
00:54:33,171 --> 00:54:37,139
[both grunting]

1098
00:54:39,344 --> 00:54:41,010
[blows landing]

1099
00:54:41,012 --> 00:54:45,014
[all grunting and fighting]

1100
00:54:56,361 --> 00:54:57,526
I gotcha.

1101
00:54:57,528 --> 00:54:58,895
[yelps]

1102
00:55:00,164 --> 00:55:01,998
[all panting]

1103
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:05,401
Hey, we could use
a little help here.

1104
00:55:07,338 --> 00:55:08,304
Thanks.

1105
00:55:08,306 --> 00:55:09,972
Going up.

1106
00:55:09,974 --> 00:55:13,175
[Crusher groaning]

1107
00:55:15,013 --> 00:55:18,381
[swirling]

1108
00:55:20,184 --> 00:55:21,517
How are you?

1109
00:55:21,519 --> 00:55:23,686
How do you think I am?
Awful.

1110
00:55:23,688 --> 00:55:26,589
Right. If Jimmy Ginseng
hadn't arrived in time,

1111
00:55:26,591 --> 00:55:29,592
we really would have
become your victims.

1112
00:55:29,594 --> 00:55:33,195
You're ruining everything now.

1113
00:55:33,197 --> 00:55:35,631
Play your song.

1114
00:55:35,633 --> 00:55:39,201
[ethereal rocking music]

1115
00:55:40,672 --> 00:55:42,638
Make it stop!

1116
00:55:45,944 --> 00:55:48,978
I must resist.

1117
00:55:52,717 --> 00:55:54,283
Yes!

1118
00:55:54,285 --> 00:55:57,687
You've freed me from the
Evil Master's mind-control.

1119
00:55:57,689 --> 00:56:00,456
Ah, much better.

1120
00:56:00,458 --> 00:56:02,024
Are you OK?

1121
00:56:02,026 --> 00:56:03,592
I just need to rest.

1122
00:56:03,594 --> 00:56:05,227
It's up to you now.

1123
00:56:05,229 --> 00:56:07,964
Don't worry. We'll
take care of everything.

1124
00:56:09,167 --> 00:56:10,566
- Take care.
- Thank you.

1125
00:56:10,568 --> 00:56:12,568
What do you think
we should do next?

1126
00:56:12,570 --> 00:56:15,338
Well, first, we should ask them
where the Evil Master is.

1127
00:56:15,340 --> 00:56:19,175
No. I think we should
rescue the princess first.

1128
00:56:19,177 --> 00:56:21,110
Mmm. She's right.

1129
00:56:21,112 --> 00:56:22,712
The poor princess
has been locked away

1130
00:56:22,714 --> 00:56:26,315
in an awful place
and needs to be rescued now.

1131
00:56:26,317 --> 00:56:28,284
Yeah.

1132
00:56:28,285 --> 00:56:30,252
Can you take us right
to her, Crusher the Ox?

1133
00:56:30,254 --> 00:56:33,289
Yes, of course, I can.
It would be an honor.

1134
00:56:35,493 --> 00:56:38,027
Uh. General, sir.

1135
00:56:38,029 --> 00:56:40,262
Step aside. Move it!

1136
00:56:40,264 --> 00:56:42,665
Yes, sir. Sorry, General.

1137
00:56:45,203 --> 00:56:48,471
- How much further?
- Not too far.

1138
00:56:55,747 --> 00:57:00,149
[groans] This place smells worse
than Peggy's gas bombs.

1139
00:57:01,352 --> 00:57:03,719
It's enough to make me
wanna cock-a-doodle croak.

1140
00:57:03,721 --> 00:57:05,187
I can't take any more.

1141
00:57:05,189 --> 00:57:08,424
Hey, we're all in the
same stinky boat for now.

1142
00:57:12,096 --> 00:57:16,132
Princess Angelica,
we're here to rescue you.

1143
00:57:16,134 --> 00:57:19,769
I have been waiting for
all of you to come here.

1144
00:57:19,771 --> 00:57:23,339
[evil laughter]

1145
00:57:23,341 --> 00:57:26,108
[all gasping in surprise]

1146
00:57:26,110 --> 00:57:27,710
We've been tricked.

1147
00:57:27,712 --> 00:57:30,379
Crusher the Ox,
why'd you sell us out?

1148
00:57:30,381 --> 00:57:32,515
I wouldn't trick
my own rescuers.

1149
00:57:32,517 --> 00:57:34,617
Ah-hah! I'm the one
who fooled you, suckers!

1150
00:57:34,619 --> 00:57:37,086
- Why you...
- Hey. I want to know what you've done

1151
00:57:37,088 --> 00:57:38,554
with Princess Angelica.

1152
00:57:38,556 --> 00:57:40,256
I bet you do.

1153
00:57:40,258 --> 00:57:45,294
You will find her locked
away in the cave behind me.

1154
00:57:45,296 --> 00:57:50,099
However, I will never
allow you to pass.

1155
00:57:50,101 --> 00:57:53,369
Oh, yeah? Well, we'll just have
to see about that, won't we?

1156
00:57:53,371 --> 00:57:55,404
All right. Let's charge him.

1157
00:57:55,406 --> 00:57:59,708
[all yelling]

1158
00:58:14,425 --> 00:58:17,293
[Bernie] Snake eyes!

1159
00:58:17,295 --> 00:58:19,295
- [GoGo] He got him!
- All right.

1160
00:58:19,297 --> 00:58:21,530
Good job, Bunny.

1161
00:58:21,532 --> 00:58:24,467
Old nine heads isn't
so powerful after all!

1162
00:58:24,469 --> 00:58:26,702
We got this.

1163
00:58:27,772 --> 00:58:29,572
[growls]

1164
00:58:29,574 --> 00:58:32,174
[all whimpering]

1165
00:58:33,411 --> 00:58:36,812
[laughing]
You lose.

1166
00:58:36,814 --> 00:58:39,849
The Rebellion of the
Seven Wonders ends here.

1167
00:58:39,851 --> 00:58:41,584
[Peggy] Bring it, ugly.

1168
00:58:41,586 --> 00:58:44,520
[Peggy shouting]

1169
00:58:57,468 --> 00:58:59,435
[shrieks]

1170
00:58:59,437 --> 00:59:03,172
Huh? You regenerated?
But that's against the rules!

1171
00:59:03,174 --> 00:59:04,440
[screams]

1172
00:59:04,442 --> 00:59:06,275
Everyone, together.

1173
00:59:06,277 --> 00:59:07,910
Unless we attack all
nine heads at once,

1174
00:59:07,912 --> 00:59:09,612
we won't be able to stop it.

1175
00:59:09,614 --> 00:59:14,817
There's nothing I despise
more than filthy traitors.

1176
00:59:19,924 --> 00:59:23,559
[whooping]

1177
00:59:23,561 --> 00:59:26,562
Hah. Hiyah!

1178
00:59:27,632 --> 00:59:31,233
[GoGo moaning]

1179
00:59:31,235 --> 00:59:33,702
My hair.
How dare you!

1180
00:59:33,704 --> 00:59:35,838
[groaning]

1181
00:59:36,774 --> 00:59:39,542
[crowing painfully]

1182
00:59:44,382 --> 00:59:49,285
- [growls]
- [Patrick groaning]

1183
00:59:49,287 --> 00:59:51,787
[Bernie groaning]

1184
00:59:54,325 --> 00:59:56,592
[Patrick] Bernie. The notes.

1185
00:59:56,594 --> 00:59:59,261
Yes. I'll use the note.

1186
00:59:59,263 --> 01:00:00,796
Careful.

1187
01:00:00,798 --> 01:00:04,333
[Bernie straining]

1188
01:00:04,335 --> 01:00:07,836
Step aside.
I'm burnin' mad, now.

1189
01:00:10,341 --> 01:00:13,275
I'm gonna break this snake.

1190
01:00:13,277 --> 01:00:14,510
Let's do this!

1191
01:00:14,512 --> 01:00:15,911
No, wait!

1192
01:00:15,913 --> 01:00:17,279
[all] Stop!

1193
01:00:17,281 --> 01:00:19,848
There's no stopping me now.

1194
01:00:21,219 --> 01:00:23,586
Feel the burn!

1195
01:00:23,588 --> 01:00:27,289
Patrick, run! Or we're all
going to be turned to ash.

1196
01:00:27,291 --> 01:00:28,424
Ah, see that?

1197
01:00:28,426 --> 01:00:31,227
That's how you do it.

1198
01:00:31,229 --> 01:00:34,897
[Bernie laughing]

1199
01:00:40,938 --> 01:00:43,372
I can't believe
we finally made it.

1200
01:00:43,374 --> 01:00:46,408
[all groaning]

1201
01:00:46,410 --> 01:00:47,710
I'm exhausted.

1202
01:00:47,712 --> 01:00:49,745
I found this burnt
piece of paper.

1203
01:00:49,747 --> 01:00:52,314
- What is it?
- It's from the Fox Elder.

1204
01:00:52,316 --> 01:00:55,251
She told him to open it,
when in desperate danger.

1205
01:00:55,253 --> 01:00:56,952
So, what does it say?

1206
01:00:56,954 --> 01:01:00,322
We must sacrifice one
for the sake of all.

1207
01:01:00,324 --> 01:01:03,626
[all whimpering]

1208
01:01:03,628 --> 01:01:05,361
We should honor his sacrifice.

1209
01:01:05,363 --> 01:01:07,863
Let's go rescue
Princess Angelica.

1210
01:01:07,865 --> 01:01:09,798
[all grunting assent]

1211
01:01:16,641 --> 01:01:19,875
[Crusher] This is where the nine-headed
snake has been keeping her.

1212
01:01:19,877 --> 01:01:23,946
- This is terrible.
- She's in a trance.

1213
01:01:23,948 --> 01:01:26,582
- Princess Angelica.
- Is she alright?

1214
01:01:26,584 --> 01:01:28,017
She can't hear us.

1215
01:01:28,019 --> 01:01:29,752
We have to hurry and save her.

1216
01:01:29,754 --> 01:01:33,022
Princess Angelica, I'll come
over there and save you.

1217
01:01:33,024 --> 01:01:34,490
No, wait.

1218
01:01:34,492 --> 01:01:35,991
Stop. You can't.

1219
01:01:35,993 --> 01:01:37,626
It's not safe.

1220
01:01:37,628 --> 01:01:40,329
The water is contaminated.

1221
01:01:40,331 --> 01:01:43,799
It's filled with evil poison.
Don't touch it.

1222
01:01:43,801 --> 01:01:46,969
GoGo Goat, use your whip
and pull the princess clear.

1223
01:01:46,971 --> 01:01:49,338
- OK.
- No, that won't be sufficient.

1224
01:01:49,340 --> 01:01:52,775
I calculate your whip won't stand
a chance against those chains.

1225
01:01:52,777 --> 01:01:54,643
Someone is gonna
have to cross the water

1226
01:01:54,645 --> 01:01:56,879
and undo those
chains to free her.

1227
01:01:56,881 --> 01:02:00,382
- Let me be the one.
- Huh?

1228
01:02:00,384 --> 01:02:03,652
If I'd have taken down that
snake when this all started,

1229
01:02:03,654 --> 01:02:06,789
Bernie Hothead wouldn't have
had to finish him by himself.

1230
01:02:06,791 --> 01:02:08,824
It's the least I could do.

1231
01:02:08,826 --> 01:02:10,459
[Crusher groaning]

1232
01:02:10,461 --> 01:02:11,994
Ox, no!

1233
01:02:13,064 --> 01:02:15,464
I'm the one to blame.

1234
01:02:15,466 --> 01:02:17,733
When I was bewitched
by the Evil Master,

1235
01:02:17,735 --> 01:02:21,036
I almost destroyed
Merryland with my rage.

1236
01:02:21,038 --> 01:02:23,672
A sword cannot
break these chains.

1237
01:02:23,674 --> 01:02:26,442
Only I have the
strength that can do it.

1238
01:02:26,444 --> 01:02:29,511
[groaning]

1239
01:02:40,691 --> 01:02:43,092
Almost there.

1240
01:02:45,096 --> 01:02:46,962
Your highness.

1241
01:02:46,964 --> 01:02:49,698
[Patrick] It was
too much for him.

1242
01:02:49,700 --> 01:02:51,100
[Spinny] That poor bovine.

1243
01:02:51,102 --> 01:02:52,768
He'll be all right.

1244
01:02:52,770 --> 01:02:54,103
So, how is she doing?

1245
01:02:54,105 --> 01:02:56,872
The power of the
Dragon Ball will protect her.

1246
01:02:56,874 --> 01:02:59,108
Eventually, she will be fine.

1247
01:02:59,110 --> 01:03:02,878
But as for Crusher,
I cannot say.

1248
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:04,813
You gonna be OK, there, buddy?

1249
01:03:04,815 --> 01:03:06,982
Don't worry about me.

1250
01:03:06,984 --> 01:03:09,585
I finally did
something really good.

1251
01:03:09,587 --> 01:03:10,819
Don't give up.

1252
01:03:10,821 --> 01:03:12,588
We'll find a way to cure you.

1253
01:03:12,590 --> 01:03:14,857
Eventually, I'll be fine.

1254
01:03:15,860 --> 01:03:18,460
But you need to save
Princess Angelica.

1255
01:03:18,462 --> 01:03:21,096
[everyone agreeing]

1256
01:03:21,098 --> 01:03:23,399
Wait. I still smell the snake.

1257
01:03:23,401 --> 01:03:25,734
[Billy] The snake? Where?

1258
01:03:26,670 --> 01:03:28,504
I thought he was gone for good.

1259
01:03:28,506 --> 01:03:30,606
So, what are we gonna do now?

1260
01:03:30,608 --> 01:03:33,175
We've got to get the
princess and get outta here.

1261
01:03:33,177 --> 01:03:35,744
There's only one way
out of this chamber,

1262
01:03:35,746 --> 01:03:37,913
but it's blocked by the snake.

1263
01:03:37,915 --> 01:03:39,148
We can't get out.

1264
01:03:39,150 --> 01:03:42,017
Then why don't we
dig a new passage?

1265
01:03:42,019 --> 01:03:44,753
[all] Huh?

1266
01:03:44,755 --> 01:03:45,954
[all gasping]

1267
01:03:45,956 --> 01:03:48,157
Together again.
Hello, friends.

1268
01:03:48,159 --> 01:03:49,525
[all] Manny Mantis.

1269
01:03:49,527 --> 01:03:51,760
- Nice to see you.
- How'd you find us?

1270
01:03:51,762 --> 01:03:53,629
I am a master of many skills.

1271
01:03:53,631 --> 01:03:55,898
We'll talk later, but for now,
you must follow me.

1272
01:03:55,900 --> 01:03:59,968
Manny's right. We can talk about
all that once we've escaped.

1273
01:03:59,970 --> 01:04:02,971
But first we must
get the princess.

1274
01:04:02,973 --> 01:04:05,641
[roaring]

1275
01:04:10,781 --> 01:04:13,115
Not so fast!

1276
01:04:15,686 --> 01:04:17,186
I can't hold it much longer.

1277
01:04:17,188 --> 01:04:18,587
Try!

1278
01:04:18,589 --> 01:04:20,522
Wait. I'm stuck.

1279
01:04:20,524 --> 01:04:23,459
You're right. I'm afraid the
opening isn't quite big enough.

1280
01:04:23,461 --> 01:04:26,662
- Allow me to...
- [screaming]

1281
01:04:26,664 --> 01:04:29,097
Peggy, go next.
Take Ox with you.

1282
01:04:29,099 --> 01:04:30,966
- I can hold the door.
- No, I can hold it.

1283
01:04:30,968 --> 01:04:34,036
- You get out with Ox.
- No. You leave first.

1284
01:04:34,038 --> 01:04:35,237
[Peggy] Wait. Get out of here.

1285
01:04:35,239 --> 01:04:37,039
- [Patrick] You first.
- [Peggy] You go.

1286
01:04:37,041 --> 01:04:38,207
[Patrick] No, you first.

1287
01:04:38,209 --> 01:04:40,876
I can hold back the snake.
You two, go!

1288
01:04:40,878 --> 01:04:43,946
No, Crusher.

1289
01:04:43,948 --> 01:04:46,548
I've got this.
Escape while you still can.

1290
01:04:46,550 --> 01:04:48,150
Hurry, before it's too late!

1291
01:04:48,152 --> 01:04:50,819
I'll stay here,
but you have to save Merryland.

1292
01:04:50,821 --> 01:04:52,020
Crusher!

1293
01:04:52,022 --> 01:04:53,822
You found your courage, Patrick.

1294
01:04:53,824 --> 01:04:55,591
Now's the time to use it.

1295
01:04:55,593 --> 01:04:57,559
Go now. Have faith in yourself.

1296
01:04:57,561 --> 01:05:00,829
Thank you, Crusher.
Come on.

1297
01:05:00,831 --> 01:05:03,765
[Crusher groaning]

1298
01:05:03,767 --> 01:05:07,102
[Patrick and Peggy yelling]

1299
01:05:07,104 --> 01:05:11,607
[all yelling]

1300
01:05:19,850 --> 01:05:23,051
[yelling]

1301
01:05:25,189 --> 01:05:26,555
Is everyone OK?

1302
01:05:26,557 --> 01:05:28,757
No, it's filthy here.
How can it be OK?

1303
01:05:28,759 --> 01:05:32,561
This place is disgusting.
I can't wait to take a bath.

1304
01:05:32,563 --> 01:05:34,663
[Crusher groaning]

1305
01:05:34,665 --> 01:05:35,964
[Crusher] No, you don't.

1306
01:05:35,966 --> 01:05:38,000
Stay back!

1307
01:05:38,002 --> 01:05:41,670
[roaring]

1308
01:05:41,672 --> 01:05:47,543
[Evil Master] You thought you
could contain me! Never!

1309
01:05:50,614 --> 01:05:53,882
[roaring]

1310
01:05:53,884 --> 01:05:57,019
[ground shattering]

1311
01:05:57,021 --> 01:05:59,721
You will never escape!

1312
01:05:59,723 --> 01:06:02,925
[rocks breaking]

1313
01:06:05,229 --> 01:06:07,329
Did Crusher the Ox
make it out OK?

1314
01:06:07,331 --> 01:06:09,598
Well...

1315
01:06:13,671 --> 01:06:16,905
[rocks breaking]

1316
01:06:19,176 --> 01:06:22,344
[all gasping]

1317
01:06:23,681 --> 01:06:26,214
[rocks breaking]

1318
01:06:30,988 --> 01:06:32,854
[all yelping]

1319
01:06:48,806 --> 01:06:50,839
What are we gonna do?

1320
01:06:50,841 --> 01:06:52,674
There's a cave.
Let's hide in there.

1321
01:06:52,676 --> 01:06:56,378
- Yeah!
- Come on. Hurry!

1322
01:07:09,360 --> 01:07:11,760
- [growling]
- [whimpering]

1323
01:07:11,762 --> 01:07:14,029
Shh. Quiet.

1324
01:07:16,300 --> 01:07:18,133
No!

1325
01:07:19,303 --> 01:07:21,103
[Patrick] We've been
hiding here all night.

1326
01:07:21,105 --> 01:07:23,772
That nine-headed snake's
gotta leave at some point.

1327
01:07:23,774 --> 01:07:26,174
[rooster crowing]

1328
01:07:27,778 --> 01:07:29,144
[all shushing]

1329
01:07:29,146 --> 01:07:31,146
I can't help it.
It's in my nature.

1330
01:07:31,148 --> 01:07:33,348
Roosters crow at
the crack of dawn.

1331
01:07:33,350 --> 01:07:35,217
[growling]

1332
01:07:35,219 --> 01:07:37,853
I've got you now.

1333
01:07:38,722 --> 01:07:41,223
All right, ugly.
I've had enough.

1334
01:07:41,225 --> 01:07:42,958
Hey, 18-eyes.

1335
01:07:42,960 --> 01:07:45,127
I'm gonna give your thousand
teeth just one chance

1336
01:07:45,129 --> 01:07:48,730
to give yourself up,
right now, or I'm... What?

1337
01:07:48,732 --> 01:07:50,065
[yells]

1338
01:07:52,169 --> 01:07:54,436
Let's get Princess Angelica
out of here.

1339
01:07:54,438 --> 01:07:57,839
[panting]

1340
01:08:01,211 --> 01:08:04,880
- A little help, guys!
- I need to go help Patrick.

1341
01:08:04,882 --> 01:08:07,749
Huh? Hey, you don't get
to be the only hero.

1342
01:08:07,751 --> 01:08:09,217
[barks]
I'll stay, too.

1343
01:08:09,219 --> 01:08:10,686
Me, too.

1344
01:08:10,688 --> 01:08:12,287
I suppose that means me, too.

1345
01:08:12,289 --> 01:08:14,856
But then I really
have to shower.

1346
01:08:14,858 --> 01:08:16,992
You are obviously going
to need my expertise.

1347
01:08:16,994 --> 01:08:20,462
- And I'll stay, too.
- Hey, don't leave me out!

1348
01:08:20,464 --> 01:08:23,298
If you all stay, then who's
gonna help the princess escape?

1349
01:08:23,300 --> 01:08:26,802
No, I'm fine.
The sun will be coming out soon.

1350
01:08:26,804 --> 01:08:29,204
The power of the snake is
at its weakest right now.

1351
01:08:29,206 --> 01:08:31,173
It's the best time
to destroy it.

1352
01:08:31,175 --> 01:08:32,974
[everyone agreeing]

1353
01:08:32,976 --> 01:08:35,377

1355
01:08:47,991 --> 01:08:52,060

- Yes. Hurry faster!

[groaning]

1360
01:09:17,821 --> 01:09:20,489
Look. It's our best chance.
Attack!

1361
01:09:20,491 --> 01:09:22,758
[making martial arts noises]

1362
01:09:28,966 --> 01:09:32,033
[Peggy shouting]

1363
01:09:39,510 --> 01:09:41,977
Make it stop!

1364
01:09:41,979 --> 01:09:46,181
[groaning]

1365
01:09:54,858 --> 01:09:58,193
[Dragon Necklace humming]

1366
01:09:58,195 --> 01:10:00,028
I have faith.

1367
01:10:00,030 --> 01:10:02,998
I won't give up until
the last bear falls.

1368
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:04,466
Whoa!

1369
01:10:04,468 --> 01:10:07,102
[Dragon Necklace humming]

1370
01:10:10,274 --> 01:10:12,474

[screaming]

1373
01:10:34,164 --> 01:10:36,431
[Patrick]
Oh. Look at that.

1374
01:10:36,433 --> 01:10:38,333
[all gasping]

1375
01:10:38,335 --> 01:10:41,036
Wow.

1376
01:10:41,038 --> 01:10:44,039
Great Panda Warrior,
you have finally arrived.

1377
01:10:44,041 --> 01:10:47,042
Help us to defeat
the nine-headed snake.

1378
01:10:47,044 --> 01:10:49,244
I'm afraid you're
too late, Faith.

1379
01:10:49,246 --> 01:10:51,580
You'll never have enough
power to defeat me.

1380
01:10:51,582 --> 01:10:55,083
I will, with the power
of the Panda Warrior.

1381
01:10:55,085 --> 01:10:58,320
Together, we are invincible.

1382
01:10:58,322 --> 01:11:00,422
[Patrick]
Who is that great whale?

1383
01:11:00,424 --> 01:11:05,427
[Bobby] That's Faith. One of the heavenly
whales and guardians of Merryland.

1384
01:11:05,429 --> 01:11:07,362
[Patrick]
Wow, she's beautiful.

1385
01:11:07,364 --> 01:11:09,965
[Bobby] She protects
the Dragon Ball of Light.

1386
01:11:09,967 --> 01:11:13,468
Along with Hope,
the other heavenly whale.

1387
01:11:31,421 --> 01:11:34,189
[all murmuring]

1388
01:12:04,121 --> 01:12:08,056
That infernal Faith
has ruined all of my plans.

1389
01:12:11,028 --> 01:12:13,161
This is not possible.

1390
01:12:16,199 --> 01:12:18,099
[hissing]

1391
01:12:18,101 --> 01:12:20,368
I will destroy you all.

1392
01:12:28,145 --> 01:12:31,446
[cheering]

1393
01:12:31,448 --> 01:12:35,083
[screaming]
It burns!

1394
01:12:37,688 --> 01:12:39,354
Now!

1395
01:12:39,356 --> 01:12:40,689

[all yelling]

1405
01:13:07,050 --> 01:13:09,351
I'm all tangled up!

1406
01:13:10,253 --> 01:13:13,121
No, you can't!

1407
01:13:13,123 --> 01:13:15,991
- [Patrick] Formation.
- [all] Battle array.

1408
01:13:15,993 --> 01:13:17,459
Hiyah!

[Evil Master screaming]

1410
01:13:22,232 --> 01:13:24,232
Bye-bye!

[rat crying]

1412
01:13:31,241 --> 01:13:32,607
That was terrifying.

1413
01:13:32,609 --> 01:13:35,076
No more nine-headed
snake for me.

1414
01:13:35,078 --> 01:13:38,680
That's it! I don't want to
be the Evil Master anymore.
