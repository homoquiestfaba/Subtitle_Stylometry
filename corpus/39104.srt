1
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:50,273
Come on!

2
00:00:54,621 --> 00:00:56,316
Hurry up!

3
00:01:25,618 --> 00:01:28,587
These are the headdresses...

4
00:01:28,788 --> 00:01:31,916
...of the queens that have gone
before us.

5
00:01:32,125 --> 00:01:36,357
They come from Indian holy ground...

6
00:01:36,563 --> 00:01:39,896
...the jungles of the ancients...

7
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:42,295
...prairies of the Norwegians...

8
00:01:42,502 --> 00:01:45,528
...and the forests
of the mighty Amazons.

9
00:01:45,738 --> 00:01:49,674
The royal crowns of our people.

10
00:01:53,146 --> 00:01:57,549
This is the blood of our people.

11
00:01:57,851 --> 00:02:00,183
The wolf people...

12
00:02:00,386 --> 00:02:02,581
...the alligator people...

13
00:02:02,755 --> 00:02:04,950
...and the moon women...

14
00:02:05,191 --> 00:02:09,855
...from which we gain our strengths
to rule all worlds.

15
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:13,398
Its okay, its just chocolate.

16
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:16,967
Teensy Melissa Whitman,
I declare you...

17
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:21,630
...Princess Naked As a Jaybird.

18
00:02:22,642 --> 00:02:28,171
Caro Eliza Bennett,
I crown you Duchess Soaring Hawk.

19
00:02:28,414 --> 00:02:33,545
Necie Rose Kelleher,
I crown you Countess Singing Cloud.

20
00:02:33,786 --> 00:02:39,281
And l, Viviane Joan Abbott,
am hereby and forever...

21
00:02:39,559 --> 00:02:43,359
...Queen Dancing Creek.

22
00:02:49,502 --> 00:02:53,905
Wait. I dont think we should
cut ourselves with that knife.

23
00:02:54,107 --> 00:02:55,574
Silence!

24
00:03:04,951 --> 00:03:10,719
We are the flames of the fires,
the whirling of the winds.

25
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:15,657
We are the waters of the rains
and the rivers and the oceans.

26
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:18,831
We are the rocks and the stones.

27
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:23,731
And now, by the power
invested in me, I declare...

28
00:03:23,937 --> 00:03:27,338
...we are the mighty
Ya-Ya priestesses.

29
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:29,531
Let no man put us under.

30
00:03:29,742 --> 00:03:34,736
Now our blood flows through each other
as its done for all eternity.

31
00:03:34,981 --> 00:03:36,972
Loyal forever.

32
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:43,315
We raise our voices
in the words of mumbo gumbo.

33
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:46,753
-Ya-Ya!
-Ya-Ya!

34
00:04:16,456 --> 00:04:18,754
My mother.

35
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:22,053
What can I say about my mother?

36
00:04:22,328 --> 00:04:25,297
Theres nobody
like Vivi Abbott Walker.

37
00:04:25,498 --> 00:04:28,126
Shell be the first one
to tell you that.

38
00:04:28,568 --> 00:04:33,301
Mom was loaded with charm,
looks, the whole package.

39
00:04:33,573 --> 00:04:37,031
-But damaged.
-Wounded.

40
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:41,613
-The most charming wounded person ever.
-Wounded? How?

41
00:04:41,814 --> 00:04:46,046
By the times as much as anything.
She had star quality.

42
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:51,815
She wanted a bigger life than being
a cotton farmers wife with four kids.

43
00:04:52,058 --> 00:04:53,616
I dont know.

44
00:04:53,826 --> 00:04:56,556
Shes just too complex.

45
00:04:57,263 --> 00:04:59,993
She can be alarmingly simple...

46
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:04,797
...and then, suddenly dark
and complicated.

47
00:05:08,274 --> 00:05:10,265
Sidda, is that it?

48
00:05:14,781 --> 00:05:18,080
We dont want to burn the place down.
Is that it?

49
00:05:18,284 --> 00:05:20,752
Thats exactly it.

50
00:05:23,089 --> 00:05:26,058
But she danced her way through it.

51
00:05:26,859 --> 00:05:31,125
Everybody smoked too much,
drank too much, fought too much.

52
00:05:32,932 --> 00:05:38,598
The women manipulated, the men hid out,
huddled in their duck camps...

53
00:05:38,771 --> 00:05:42,070
...waiting for the storm to pass.

54
00:05:42,241 --> 00:05:46,075
And yet, it seems like
theyre mostly having fun.

55
00:05:46,245 --> 00:05:49,806
When you saydark,
you mean angry? Violent?

56
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:52,211
No.

57
00:05:52,452 --> 00:05:55,979
Even though she knew how
to handle a switch or a belt.

58
00:05:56,222 --> 00:05:57,211
Oh, no!

59
00:05:57,423 --> 00:06:01,985
They came from thespare the rod,
spoil the childphilosophy.

60
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:03,162
What?

61
00:06:03,396 --> 00:06:05,864
I owe all my creativity to her.

62
00:06:06,065 --> 00:06:10,126
If my childhood was easy,
Id have nothing to write about.

63
00:06:22,248 --> 00:06:26,207
The daughter of a tap-dancing,
child-abuser of a mother...

64
00:06:26,452 --> 00:06:29,182
...and a distant,
emotionally absent fath...

65
00:06:29,422 --> 00:06:32,585
Oh, shit! Oh, shit, Connor!

66
00:06:32,792 --> 00:06:35,852
-God, this is a disaster.
-Its a little harsh.

67
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:38,360
-I didnt mean it that way!
-Calm down.

68
00:06:38,531 --> 00:06:41,466
You dont understand.
Give me a Xanax. Please.

69
00:06:41,667 --> 00:06:45,899
Opening nights only, babe.
And thats your rule.

70
00:06:46,472 --> 00:06:50,568
All I can say is, I hope
this is not a real emergency...

71
00:06:50,777 --> 00:06:54,770
...because I only brought
one bottle of vodka.

72
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:02,544
Vivi?

73
00:07:03,489 --> 00:07:05,218
Were here!

74
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:07,791
I got this.

75
00:07:08,394 --> 00:07:10,692
That ungrateful bitch!

76
00:07:10,897 --> 00:07:14,492
Whod have thought
shed be the one to do me in?

77
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:18,136
Here, bebe, take a swallow.

78
00:07:19,405 --> 00:07:21,566
It needs Tabasco.

79
00:07:22,675 --> 00:07:25,610
Oh, my God. How?!

80
00:07:25,812 --> 00:07:30,010
How could she do it?
She was supposed to be the good one!

81
00:07:30,249 --> 00:07:32,774
You know how long
I was in labor with her?

82
00:07:33,019 --> 00:07:35,988
-Two hours, not even.
-Well, it felt longer!

83
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:41,758
-Never speak to Time magazine.
-That writer probably trumped that up.

84
00:07:41,961 --> 00:07:46,625
Those Yankees like to make us out
to be alligator-wrestling bigots.

85
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:49,301
You should call Sidda, get the facts.

86
00:07:49,502 --> 00:07:53,029
Teensy, since you quit drinking,
you dont think.

87
00:07:53,239 --> 00:07:57,505
How can I possibly call somebody
who no longer exists?

88
00:07:58,044 --> 00:07:59,204
Get the phone.

89
00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:03,510
Oh, my God, thats her.
Do not pick up the phone.

90
00:08:03,749 --> 00:08:06,479
Connor, dont pick up the phone!

91
00:08:06,719 --> 00:08:09,347
Connor, dont! Dont do it.

92
00:08:09,589 --> 00:08:11,147
Hello?

93
00:08:11,357 --> 00:08:14,349
-Hello, Connor.
-Hello, Vivi, how are you?

94
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:18,462
Well, just lovely.
Thank you for asking. Is she there?

95
00:08:19,265 --> 00:08:23,031
-Why did you do that?
-Shes fine.

96
00:08:23,236 --> 00:08:25,363
Talk to her.

97
00:08:33,079 --> 00:08:34,706
Mama?

98
00:08:37,583 --> 00:08:39,881
Give it to me! Give it to me!

99
00:08:40,119 --> 00:08:43,111
Sidda, shell have to call you back.

100
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:47,759
Tell her shes dead!
Shes dead to me!

101
00:08:50,396 --> 00:08:52,728
Well, what did she say?

102
00:08:57,103 --> 00:09:00,561
Im sick and tired of her tantrums
and drunken rages!

103
00:09:00,773 --> 00:09:05,301
I heard the ice in the glass, Mama!
Sounds of my happy childhood!

104
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:07,877
Why do you let her get to you?

105
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:13,848
Whats wrong with a nice simple:
Hi, Mom, love you too, see you later?

106
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:18,387
-Whats wrong with that?
-With normal people, youd be right!

107
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:20,991
-But Vivi Walker...
-Whos a grown woman...

108
00:09:21,193 --> 00:09:26,153
Has never gotten over anything
in her privileged, booze-soaked life!

109
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:37,830
Shep!

110
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:40,033
Shep, come here!

111
00:10:40,239 --> 00:10:43,504
-Oh, my God, shes gonna do it.
-What?

112
00:10:43,676 --> 00:10:48,875
Look, shes gonna marry that boy.
I mean, that man.

113
00:10:49,115 --> 00:10:51,845
One: does that mean
you two are speaking?

114
00:10:52,018 --> 00:10:55,886
And two: how much
is it gonna cost me?

115
00:10:58,724 --> 00:11:00,919
When is it?

116
00:11:01,827 --> 00:11:04,193
And where is it?

117
00:11:05,698 --> 00:11:08,690
Dont answer it, its her. Dont!

118
00:11:09,168 --> 00:11:11,363
Hello, Vivi!

119
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:13,367
Well, hello, Connor.

120
00:11:13,572 --> 00:11:16,632
Did you call to talk to Sidda
or to hang up?

121
00:11:16,842 --> 00:11:19,743
Tell her I received the invitation...

122
00:11:19,945 --> 00:11:23,540
...and all III be sending
is my condolences to you.

123
00:11:23,783 --> 00:11:28,117
Ill say to you exactly what Id say
to my own mother: grow up.

124
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:33,815
Same thing goes for you.
Both of you are acting like children.

125
00:11:34,927 --> 00:11:37,589
Did she just hang up on me?

126
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:40,931
She hung up on me.

127
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:45,963
How has your old man hung in there
for forty-odd years?

128
00:11:46,172 --> 00:11:50,734
For one thing, she moved out
of the bedroom sometime in the60s...

129
00:11:50,943 --> 00:11:54,071
...so hes had a lot
of time to himself.

130
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:57,908
-What, he snores?
-He breathes.

131
00:11:58,217 --> 00:12:02,051
There are some things
that are none of our business...

132
00:12:02,254 --> 00:12:05,155
...and we should stay out of it.

133
00:12:05,357 --> 00:12:07,052
But I didnt mean this.

134
00:12:07,259 --> 00:12:12,788
-We have an extreme situation here.
-And that requires extreme measures.

135
00:12:12,998 --> 00:12:16,559
We cant be afraid to do
what we know we have to do.

136
00:12:16,769 --> 00:12:18,566
Ya-Ya.

137
00:12:24,844 --> 00:12:26,641
Ya-Ya!

138
00:12:26,912 --> 00:12:30,313
Surprise, surprise. Mamas henchmen.

139
00:12:30,516 --> 00:12:33,451
Connor! Come here and meet the Ya-Yas.

140
00:12:33,652 --> 00:12:36,416
-You dont seem surprised.
-Of course not.

141
00:12:36,622 --> 00:12:40,615
Whenever Mama cant handle something,
yall swoop in.

142
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:43,954
Im Connor McGill.
Im pleased to meet you.

143
00:12:44,163 --> 00:12:47,929
-Im Caro. This is Teensy.
-Hello.

144
00:12:48,134 --> 00:12:50,102
-And I am Necie.
-Necie.

145
00:12:50,302 --> 00:12:54,398
-Youre a very nice-Iooking young man.
-Thank you.

146
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:59,840
Of course Im just talking about
looks here, but you look just fine.

147
00:13:00,179 --> 00:13:02,739
Thank you. Please.

148
00:13:05,484 --> 00:13:09,648
Now, before yall start,
I have just one thing to say.

149
00:13:09,855 --> 00:13:11,948
Its not gonna work.

150
00:13:12,391 --> 00:13:13,858
Listen, petit bebe...

151
00:13:14,059 --> 00:13:18,962
...no one on earth understands better
than us how crazy your mama is.

152
00:13:19,165 --> 00:13:23,602
We wont dispute that. Shes mad
as a hatter. That wont change.

153
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:26,863
-Preaching to the choir.
-Shes been like that.

154
00:13:27,072 --> 00:13:33,705
Sidda, the very fact that your mama is
the way she is, if you really knew...

155
00:13:33,913 --> 00:13:37,076
...its nothing less
than a triumph of the will.

156
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:39,614
Did you saywillorpill?

157
00:13:39,852 --> 00:13:44,255
Dont take that tone. You want
to get all scrappy, deal with me.

158
00:13:44,456 --> 00:13:48,358
That is just it!
I dont want to getall scrappy.

159
00:13:48,561 --> 00:13:50,188
Im sick of fighting.

160
00:13:50,396 --> 00:13:55,197
Im sick to death of thiscenter
of the universe, holier than thou...

161
00:13:55,401 --> 00:13:59,633
...nothing is ever enough,
Oh, how Ive suffered...

162
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:04,867
...fix me a drink, hand me a Nembutal,
worn-out Scarlett OHarathing!

163
00:14:05,144 --> 00:14:09,205
-Shes got her pegged all right.
-I am finished! Done!

164
00:14:09,448 --> 00:14:12,042
That is gone with a D!

165
00:14:13,786 --> 00:14:17,278
-Wait. Did Mama send you?
-Are you out of your mind?

166
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:20,686
Shed skin us alive
if she knew we were here.

167
00:14:20,893 --> 00:14:24,124
We said we were going to a spa
with no alcohol.

168
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:27,663
Teensy joined the triple-A.

169
00:14:27,833 --> 00:14:30,996
The point is, Sidda...

170
00:14:34,673 --> 00:14:38,234
Im starving.
We know when were licked.

171
00:14:38,611 --> 00:14:43,412
Let us take you to dinner. Well get
on the first plane in the morning.

172
00:14:43,616 --> 00:14:46,608
No questions asked.

173
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:57,787
Broadway!

174
00:14:57,997 --> 00:15:02,593
I just cant get over it.
Your mama is so proud!

175
00:15:02,801 --> 00:15:06,464
For Gods sake, we said
we wouldnt talk about Vivi.

176
00:15:06,672 --> 00:15:09,402
We took a solemn oath,
and there you go!

177
00:15:09,608 --> 00:15:11,098
It was an accident.

178
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:14,102
Why dont somebody go to the bathroom?

179
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:18,873
That always makes the food come.

180
00:15:24,523 --> 00:15:28,823
Ill go.
I need to call Connor anyway.

181
00:15:31,664 --> 00:15:33,222
Wait, what is it?

182
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:38,062
I got it from a caddy at the club.
Its aRoofieor something.

183
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:41,637
-He said itd knock her on her ass!
-No! Roofies!

184
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:44,400
Thats the date rape drug! We cant!

185
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:47,773
Shes a teetotaler
with these little drinks!

186
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:50,608
Then what?
We cant conk her on the head!

187
00:15:50,816 --> 00:15:53,808
Give her half.
Shes a Walker, she can take it!

188
00:15:54,053 --> 00:15:56,453
Here she comes!

189
00:16:05,664 --> 00:16:08,428
I had to taste it.

190
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:11,194
Its delish!

191
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:17,571
Didnt work.

192
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:23,981
The food, it didnt come.

193
00:16:26,185 --> 00:16:28,483
It didnt, did it?

194
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:30,884
Guess not.

195
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:33,023
Well...

196
00:16:33,625 --> 00:16:35,684
...heres to Mama.

197
00:16:35,894 --> 00:16:37,953
Long may she rave.

198
00:16:38,197 --> 00:16:40,131
Ya-Ya!

199
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:20,728
No!

200
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:24,699
No! What is wrong with you women?!

201
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:29,040
-Sleeping Beauty is up.
-Sleeping tiger. Ill make coffee.

202
00:17:29,281 --> 00:17:30,748
Ill get the whip.

203
00:17:30,949 --> 00:17:34,510
I have a play in rehearsal,
a fiance and a headache!

204
00:17:34,753 --> 00:17:38,553
We flew you first class.
Doesnt that count for anything?

205
00:17:38,757 --> 00:17:40,384
No!

206
00:17:40,592 --> 00:17:43,686
I dont get those underwear
up your ass crack.

207
00:17:43,862 --> 00:17:47,127
-They dont cover a thing.
-I dont get it either.

208
00:17:47,332 --> 00:17:49,857
Listen up this minute.
Im not a child.

209
00:17:50,035 --> 00:17:54,495
Im a grown woman with a life
a thousand miles away. Im going back.

210
00:17:54,673 --> 00:17:57,471
I got coffee.
Good old Louisiana chicory.

211
00:17:57,676 --> 00:18:01,009
-What are yall doing?
-A Ya-Ya mission of mercy.

212
00:18:01,246 --> 00:18:02,645
An intervention.

213
00:18:02,848 --> 00:18:05,749
Why me?
Ive been in therapy for 15 years.

214
00:18:05,984 --> 00:18:09,078
With a professional!
Shes the one that needs help.

215
00:18:09,321 --> 00:18:14,623
Youre right. But shes getting old,
like all of us. She is what she is.

216
00:18:14,827 --> 00:18:17,819
But you have a long life ahead of you.

217
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:21,363
You shouldnt have to spend it
angry and resentful.

218
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:24,934
Im not angry!
And my only resentment is yall...

219
00:18:25,137 --> 00:18:28,106
...disrupting my life
because Mamas pissed!

220
00:18:28,307 --> 00:18:32,266
All I did was tell the truth!
Hold on, Im spinning.

221
00:18:51,096 --> 00:18:54,259
-Whats that doing here?
-More will be revealed.

222
00:18:54,433 --> 00:18:56,697
Dont you dare tell her we have it.

223
00:18:56,869 --> 00:19:01,829
Theyre not talking, Necie.
Thats why were all out here.

224
00:19:03,942 --> 00:19:06,809
Siddo, kiddo,
she doesnt know youre here.

225
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:10,540
Or that we have the book.
Thats how it should stay.

226
00:19:10,749 --> 00:19:13,843
But there are some things
in there that might...

227
00:19:14,052 --> 00:19:18,648
...make a difference in how you feel
about Viviane Joan Abbott Walker.

228
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:23,386
I dont care if she was whacked
over the head by leprechauns.

229
00:19:23,562 --> 00:19:26,588
-I just want to get out of here!
-You want out?

230
00:19:26,765 --> 00:19:31,702
That book minus the chip on
your shoulder is your ticket back.

231
00:19:38,677 --> 00:19:40,406
Thief.

232
00:20:04,403 --> 00:20:07,201
-Cheers, darling.
-Cheers.

233
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:20,116
All right. Who wants to drown?

234
00:20:25,157 --> 00:20:30,026
You, Sidda.
You show them how its done!

235
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:41,068
Whos in trouble?

236
00:21:00,959 --> 00:21:04,952
S-l-D-D-A!

237
00:21:05,464 --> 00:21:07,898
Flail, darling. Make it look good!

238
00:21:08,066 --> 00:21:09,363
Say a prayer.

239
00:21:09,534 --> 00:21:12,799
Dear Jesus, we ask
that you help Miss Sidda.

240
00:21:12,971 --> 00:21:15,496
Shes going to die!

241
00:21:20,045 --> 00:21:25,574
Petit darling, you were almost
a goner, but I think youll make it!

242
00:21:26,151 --> 00:21:30,884
That was stellar. You had me
believing there for a minute.

243
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:35,453
I knew I hadnt lost my touch.

244
00:21:53,345 --> 00:21:56,746
You look good, Willetta.
Look like your old self again.

245
00:21:56,948 --> 00:22:01,976
Dont be talking about old! You the one
with the birthday around the corner.

246
00:22:02,187 --> 00:22:05,554
Dont be talking about birthdays.

247
00:22:07,893 --> 00:22:09,952
You gonna tell me whats wrong?

248
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:14,098
Or do I have to use what brain cells
I got left to figure it out?

249
00:22:14,266 --> 00:22:17,531
Theres nothing wrong. Really.

250
00:22:20,739 --> 00:22:22,730
Except...

251
00:22:23,775 --> 00:22:26,175
...well, Sidda.

252
00:22:27,212 --> 00:22:29,874
I wasnt a horrible mother, was I?

253
00:22:30,082 --> 00:22:32,642
This about that Time magazine thing?

254
00:22:32,851 --> 00:22:36,685
-Howd you know about that?
-Mr. Shep tell Chaney everything.

255
00:22:36,855 --> 00:22:41,485
And Chaney tell me everything.
And I dont tell nobody nothing.

256
00:22:41,993 --> 00:22:44,860
But Im going to tell you
something right now.

257
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:47,521
Sooner or later...

258
00:22:47,699 --> 00:22:52,102
...everybodys bill comes due.

259
00:22:53,171 --> 00:22:56,607
You just got to let the child
feel the way she feel.

260
00:22:57,042 --> 00:23:00,773
-There aint nothing else to do.
-Shit.

261
00:23:02,481 --> 00:23:07,942
Clubs are trump. Its all trumps.

262
00:23:33,912 --> 00:23:38,713
Oh, my God.
Look at how young yall are.

263
00:23:42,721 --> 00:23:44,746
Oh, my God!

264
00:23:47,192 --> 00:23:50,753
I would give anything
to know then what I know now.

265
00:23:50,929 --> 00:23:52,920
And to still have those thighs.

266
00:23:53,098 --> 00:23:56,659
Im sure theyre still buried
in there somewhere.

267
00:23:56,835 --> 00:23:58,496
What in the hell?

268
00:24:00,138 --> 00:24:05,440
That was when we went to Atlanta for
the premiere of Gone With the Wind.

269
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:09,808
-Youre joking.
-No. My Uncle James invited us.

270
00:24:09,981 --> 00:24:14,384
Aunt Louise was a big society
hoity-toity in Atlanta.

271
00:24:14,553 --> 00:24:16,180
Oh, Necie.

272
00:24:17,722 --> 00:24:20,520
-Oh, my letter.
-Necie, where were you?

273
00:24:20,692 --> 00:24:24,526
My parents didnt think Willetta
was a suitable chaperone...

274
00:24:24,696 --> 00:24:26,687
...so I missed the big scene.

275
00:24:26,865 --> 00:24:31,427
But your mama, the budding journalist,
wrote to me every day.

276
00:24:31,603 --> 00:24:33,127
All two of them.

277
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:37,605
Dearest Countess Singing Cloud...

278
00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:42,840
...we arrived in Atlanta after
an eternity on the Southern Crescent.

279
00:24:43,014 --> 00:24:45,676
They made Willetta ride
in the colored car...

280
00:24:45,884 --> 00:24:48,717
...so we were on our own
almost the whole way. "

281
00:24:48,887 --> 00:24:51,321
Girls, get yourselves on upstairs now.

282
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:55,358
And for heavens sake, get that maid
in a uniform right away.

283
00:24:55,527 --> 00:24:58,189
And get that ugly luggage
into the house...

284
00:24:58,363 --> 00:25:02,629
...before somebody thinks we got
a bunch of hobos coming to stay.

285
00:25:05,871 --> 00:25:11,207
Know what Mama says? She says Uncle
James and Aunt Lou are nouveaux riches.

286
00:25:11,376 --> 00:25:16,370
-Whats that?
-I dont know. But its not good.

287
00:25:16,581 --> 00:25:17,878
"But, sugaroo...

288
00:25:18,083 --> 00:25:24,181
...from the looks of this place,
nouveau riche is better than no riche.

289
00:25:25,323 --> 00:25:29,419
You never saw so many
beautiful things in all your life.

290
00:25:29,594 --> 00:25:32,791
Its like a museum, or even a palace.

291
00:25:32,964 --> 00:25:35,262
Just think. All this...

292
00:25:35,433 --> 00:25:41,269
...and Im gonna meet Miss Margaret
Mitchell and Clark Gable too. "

293
00:25:50,615 --> 00:25:52,742
I feel like a Paris princess.

294
00:25:52,951 --> 00:25:57,217
What yall doing in that tub?
How are yall supposed to get clean?

295
00:25:57,389 --> 00:25:59,482
Get on out of there!

296
00:25:59,658 --> 00:26:01,990
Look at you, all done up
in that uniform.

297
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:04,924
Ill take a picture
and show everyone at home!

298
00:26:05,096 --> 00:26:09,294
No, you aint. Now, get your
clothes on for fancy dinner.

299
00:26:09,467 --> 00:26:13,062
They got it all done up
like theys the king of England.

300
00:26:13,238 --> 00:26:16,230
Isnt this the most magnificent thing?

301
00:26:16,408 --> 00:26:21,368
I suppose thats what Id be thinking
if I was you. Come on.

302
00:26:35,393 --> 00:26:39,557
Lord, I done died and gone to hell.

303
00:26:41,166 --> 00:26:44,397
"When we went upstairs,
our beds were turned down...

304
00:26:44,569 --> 00:26:47,697
...just like in a fancy hotel.

305
00:26:47,872 --> 00:26:52,138
But even though it was the most
exciting night of my life...

306
00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:57,338
...I had a feeling things werent
going so well for Willetta. "

307
00:27:03,722 --> 00:27:05,121
Willetta?

308
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:10,387
What you doing down here?
Get yourself back up in that bed.

309
00:27:10,895 --> 00:27:12,226
Why are you crying?

310
00:27:12,397 --> 00:27:17,334
-Because I misses my family.
-You miss Maman Delia?

311
00:27:17,502 --> 00:27:21,029
Child, your gran aint my family.

312
00:27:21,206 --> 00:27:26,166
I got my own gran.
And my own mama and daddy too.

313
00:27:28,413 --> 00:27:31,177
You want to play cards? Like at home?

314
00:27:31,383 --> 00:27:35,581
No, child,
I dont want to play no cards.

315
00:27:36,621 --> 00:27:41,581
Then how about some hot chocolate?
Will you make me some, Willetta?

316
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:46,527
Child, if you want hot chocolate,
go fix it yourself.

317
00:27:59,077 --> 00:28:03,639
James! Why in the world are you
wearing that hat in the house?

318
00:28:06,117 --> 00:28:09,553
-Will Miss Mitchell be at the premiere?
-Who knows?

319
00:28:09,721 --> 00:28:14,124
After the Junior League denied her
membership, shes been unpredictable.

320
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:18,723
Of course, she left us no choice,
and shes still steaming.

321
00:28:18,897 --> 00:28:21,923
She brought it on herself
with that Apache dance.

322
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:25,126
Heres your hot chocolate,
just like you likes it.

323
00:28:25,303 --> 00:28:31,503
Who told you you could walk your black
Louisiana ass into our dining room?

324
00:28:32,310 --> 00:28:36,872
You got ears, nigger?
Get on out of here.

325
00:28:38,883 --> 00:28:41,681
-Did I hear you right?
-What, yall deaf?

326
00:28:41,853 --> 00:28:44,583
-I heard him loud and clear.
-Me too.

327
00:28:44,756 --> 00:28:48,624
Shut your mouth,
you prissy-ass little mamas boy!

328
00:28:50,695 --> 00:28:53,664
-Apologize before I send you back to...
-Aunt Lou!

329
00:28:54,165 --> 00:28:59,364
Let go of her, or III let that ugly
halfwit you call Junior have it again!

330
00:28:59,537 --> 00:29:02,062
Dont you dare!

331
00:29:03,408 --> 00:29:04,898
Oops, slipped.

332
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:09,469
Im sorry, Mrs. Whitman.
Im sorry your son is a baboons ass.

333
00:29:09,647 --> 00:29:12,047
Ya-Ya!

334
00:29:14,719 --> 00:29:16,584
What a wretched woman!

335
00:29:16,755 --> 00:29:20,691
Shes dead now, Im happy to say.

336
00:29:20,859 --> 00:29:24,818
I never saw my mama so proud
as when we stepped off that train.

337
00:29:24,996 --> 00:29:29,023
Buggy, on the other hand,
made Vivi do penance for a month.

338
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:32,761
She thought for sure
shed lost her place in heaven.

339
00:29:32,937 --> 00:29:36,896
Worrying about the afterlife is
no way to live through this one.

340
00:29:37,075 --> 00:29:40,169
Honey, your Grandma Buggy was about...

341
00:29:40,378 --> 00:29:43,677
...the unhappiest person
I think I have ever seen.

342
00:29:43,882 --> 00:29:46,976
And there was something
in Vivis very nature that...

343
00:29:47,185 --> 00:29:49,813
Scared the shit out of her.

344
00:29:50,021 --> 00:29:53,957
She was overwhelmed by Vivis
life force. Nothings changed.

345
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:56,753
Since your mama came
into this world...

346
00:29:56,928 --> 00:29:59,795
...she took up all the space
in the room.

347
00:30:06,337 --> 00:30:09,704
-Thats my brother, Jack.
-I didnt know you had one.

348
00:30:09,874 --> 00:30:13,776
Thats why youre here, bebe,
to know what you didnt know.

349
00:30:40,371 --> 00:30:43,204
May I tell you a secret?

350
00:30:43,541 --> 00:30:45,406
In my prayers...

351
00:30:45,577 --> 00:30:50,674
...I thank God for granting my son
his true love at an early age.

352
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:47,196
Sunflower, will you come
and take a walk with me?

353
00:31:47,372 --> 00:31:48,430
Of course.

354
00:31:57,348 --> 00:32:01,546
You dont wanna be a pilot,
you want to impress your father.

355
00:32:01,686 --> 00:32:05,452
Come on, Vivi,
I aint doing this just for him.

356
00:32:07,425 --> 00:32:10,189
Theres a war on.
Itd be wrong not to go.

357
00:32:10,361 --> 00:32:13,421
Itd be wrong to leave me here.
You said...

358
00:32:13,598 --> 00:32:16,999
Im sorry, bebe. Its already done.

359
00:32:17,235 --> 00:32:20,636
Besides, I gotta do
something right for the old man.

360
00:32:20,805 --> 00:32:23,467
-Will you come back?
-Of course.

361
00:32:23,641 --> 00:32:26,109
-Swear on the Virgin.
-I swear.

362
00:32:26,311 --> 00:32:30,839
-Swear on your mothers life.
-I swear.

363
00:32:31,015 --> 00:32:33,711
Now I want you to make me a promise.

364
00:32:33,918 --> 00:32:36,443
Promise me that when I come home...

365
00:32:36,821 --> 00:32:40,313
...youll be the one I come home to,
you understand?

366
00:32:41,993 --> 00:32:46,362
What if Im away being
a big city newspaper woman...?

367
00:32:54,238 --> 00:33:00,040
You can do anything you set your
mind to. You know that, dont you?

368
00:33:01,946 --> 00:33:04,642
Im going to miss you.

369
00:33:07,552 --> 00:33:10,521
He made me swear not to
till he told you.

370
00:33:10,722 --> 00:33:13,953
You should have warned me.
What did Genevieve say?

371
00:33:14,125 --> 00:33:16,719
She cried and begged him
to change his mind.

372
00:33:16,894 --> 00:33:21,331
Daddy called her unpatriotic.
He gave a speech and made a toast.

373
00:33:21,499 --> 00:33:25,060
Mama swore shed never drink
to a son going to war...

374
00:33:25,236 --> 00:33:27,636
...so now Daddys in the doghouse.

375
00:33:27,805 --> 00:33:28,794
Amen.

376
00:33:28,973 --> 00:33:31,771
Theres not a goddamn breeze
in Louisiana.

377
00:33:32,410 --> 00:33:35,072
Will someone please wring me out?

378
00:33:35,246 --> 00:33:38,613
We cannot just sit here and puddle.

379
00:33:39,117 --> 00:33:41,585
Well have to make our own breeze!

380
00:33:58,536 --> 00:34:02,973
No! Dont you do that!

381
00:34:05,810 --> 00:34:07,209
Oh, my God!

382
00:34:17,422 --> 00:34:20,118
Do not pull over, Teensy. I mean it!

383
00:34:22,593 --> 00:34:27,792
If you cant talk your way out
of this one, then I dont know what!

384
00:34:30,435 --> 00:34:33,598
We are going straight to hell.

385
00:34:35,173 --> 00:34:39,041
Yeah, we went to jail. I was so proud.

386
00:34:39,210 --> 00:34:41,838
Your mama was a bad influence.

387
00:34:42,013 --> 00:34:46,609
If not for you, our moral fiber
wouldve been shredded to rags.

388
00:34:46,818 --> 00:34:49,810
Teensy, smack her for me!

389
00:34:50,521 --> 00:34:53,922
Kids, am I gonna have
to give you a time-out?

390
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:10,830
Vivi?

391
00:35:11,008 --> 00:35:12,270
Yes?

392
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:14,603
You all right?

393
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:17,140
Im fine.

394
00:35:20,318 --> 00:35:23,583
-You need anything?
-No.

395
00:35:25,990 --> 00:35:27,389
All right, then.

396
00:35:43,007 --> 00:35:46,170
I owe all my creativity to her.

397
00:35:46,344 --> 00:35:50,542
If Id had an easy childhood,
Id have nothing to write about.

398
00:35:50,715 --> 00:35:52,546
That is the truth, honey.

399
00:35:55,486 --> 00:35:58,853
Why isnt Grandma Buggys name
on this invitation?

400
00:35:59,023 --> 00:36:02,459
Well, that birthday business was ugly.

401
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:05,652
Your granddaddy had
just settled a big case...

402
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:08,663
...and he wanted to strut his money.

403
00:36:11,469 --> 00:36:14,267
Buggy didnt want to have that dance.

404
00:36:14,438 --> 00:36:16,497
She didnt believe in parties.

405
00:36:16,674 --> 00:36:20,405
And sure as hell didnt believe
in celebrating your mama.

406
00:36:20,578 --> 00:36:22,569
He did it just to spite her.

407
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:27,613
Taylor Abbott treated his horses
better than he treated his wife.

408
00:36:28,486 --> 00:36:31,819
And your mama got caught
in the crossfire.

409
00:36:32,757 --> 00:36:35,089
Boy, did she ever.

410
00:36:57,415 --> 00:36:59,383
Daddy, is it real?

411
00:36:59,517 --> 00:37:01,644
-Of course its real.
-It is?

412
00:37:02,153 --> 00:37:06,317
I think its the most beautiful thing
Ive ever seen in my life.

413
00:37:06,490 --> 00:37:08,958
Mama, its gorgeous.

414
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:11,585
Did you pick it out?

415
00:37:17,068 --> 00:37:20,367
Mr. Abbott, that is not a proper
gift for a girl.

416
00:37:20,538 --> 00:37:24,872
Thats right. But its a perfect gift
for a young woman.

417
00:37:25,042 --> 00:37:27,169
A beautiful young woman.

418
00:37:34,151 --> 00:37:39,020
Arent you just the luckiest
little girl God ever made?

419
00:37:44,295 --> 00:37:46,786
Why dont you come with me, bebe?

420
00:37:51,102 --> 00:37:52,694
Hey, good-Iooking.

421
00:37:54,472 --> 00:37:57,498
This ring doesnt compare
to the one III get you.

422
00:37:57,642 --> 00:37:58,631
Everybody saw.

423
00:37:58,809 --> 00:38:02,245
The only thing anybody saw
is how beautiful you are.

424
00:38:04,148 --> 00:38:06,548
And were not gonna be like them.

425
00:38:07,918 --> 00:38:10,716
All right? I swear, honey.
Dont you worry.

426
00:38:10,888 --> 00:38:12,446
Dont you worry.

427
00:39:00,438 --> 00:39:01,564
No!

428
00:39:02,073 --> 00:39:07,807
Whatever you did to make your father
give you this ring is a mortal sin.

429
00:39:08,679 --> 00:39:11,079
May God forgive you.

430
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:14,545
I didnt do anything!

431
00:39:15,553 --> 00:39:18,647
He just gave it to me.
I didnt do anything!

432
00:39:18,823 --> 00:39:21,348
She is sick. Dont let her get to you.

433
00:39:21,525 --> 00:39:24,961
Dont worry.
Ill steal it back if I have to.

434
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:27,793
Now do it, Buggy! Do it!

435
00:39:27,965 --> 00:39:33,062
Give the girl the goddamn ring,
you pathetic Catholic idiot.

436
00:39:38,342 --> 00:39:39,832
Pick it up.

437
00:39:41,078 --> 00:39:42,409
Daddy!

438
00:39:43,381 --> 00:39:47,442
You bend down, and you pick up
that goddamn ring.

439
00:40:01,332 --> 00:40:03,163
Give me your hand.

440
00:40:07,938 --> 00:40:11,032
Viviane, I gave this ring to you.

441
00:40:11,208 --> 00:40:12,539
Its yours.

442
00:40:13,210 --> 00:40:15,610
Its from me to you.

443
00:40:16,947 --> 00:40:18,437
You understand?

444
00:40:27,358 --> 00:40:28,985
What do you have to say?

445
00:40:29,193 --> 00:40:33,061
Making a fool of yourself
in front of Vivianes friends?

446
00:40:38,769 --> 00:40:41,033
You go to sleep, girls.

447
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:51,445
You okay?

448
00:40:52,616 --> 00:40:54,914
Yeah, but wow.

449
00:40:55,419 --> 00:40:59,219
How horrible to be so hated
by your own mother.

450
00:40:59,390 --> 00:41:03,759
Mamas jealous, competitive and
judgmental, but she doesnt hate me.

451
00:41:03,928 --> 00:41:05,327
Not like that.

452
00:41:06,063 --> 00:41:07,462
Oh, wait a minute.

453
00:41:07,631 --> 00:41:09,826
Yes, she does. Forgot.

454
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,264
Shes trying to hate you, honey.

455
00:41:12,436 --> 00:41:17,669
You delivered her a swift kick
in the ego. Shes just smarting.

456
00:41:19,243 --> 00:41:21,507
I have dreams about this.

457
00:41:26,517 --> 00:41:28,314
-Could be Chick.
-Its her.

458
00:41:28,519 --> 00:41:30,419
Could be Chick, but its her.

459
00:41:30,921 --> 00:41:32,912
-Dont answer it.
-Right.

460
00:41:38,496 --> 00:41:39,758
-Hello?
-Caught you.

461
00:41:39,930 --> 00:41:44,594
You think you can get away with this?
I know what youre up to.

462
00:41:44,768 --> 00:41:47,293
Up to? Whats that supposed to mean?

463
00:41:47,471 --> 00:41:50,031
-You dont fool me.
-Well...

464
00:41:51,275 --> 00:41:55,974
Were not up to anything. If we were,
it would be none of your business.

465
00:41:56,146 --> 00:41:58,671
Dont poke around.
Youll spoil things.

466
00:41:58,849 --> 00:42:03,582
I dont want a big fuss, thats all.
I dont want candles on my cake.

467
00:42:03,787 --> 00:42:06,278
Itll look like the burning
of Atlanta.

468
00:42:06,490 --> 00:42:10,119
When we want your advice,
well ask for it. Got it?

469
00:42:10,294 --> 00:42:11,625
Big kiss.

470
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:20,097
She thinks its about her birthday.
Can you believe it?

471
00:42:20,271 --> 00:42:23,763
-Its coming up real soon too.
-Couple of days.

472
00:42:23,941 --> 00:42:26,273
No numbers, everybody.

473
00:42:26,443 --> 00:42:30,777
Thats one thing Mom always
did real well, the birthday thing.

474
00:42:31,115 --> 00:42:33,982
In the morning,
wed have a party, just us.

475
00:42:34,218 --> 00:42:36,686
When Daddy got home,
wed do it again.

476
00:42:36,887 --> 00:42:41,324
He could never know about that
morning cake, so she always got two.

477
00:42:41,492 --> 00:42:43,289
It was our secret.

478
00:42:44,628 --> 00:42:46,926
Im so glad I had you.

479
00:42:55,639 --> 00:42:57,539
Im gonna call Connor.

480
00:42:58,042 --> 00:43:01,239
You go right ahead.
Well leave you alone.

481
00:43:04,048 --> 00:43:08,041
But well be listening from
the kitchen, so talk loud.

482
00:43:12,957 --> 00:43:13,924
Hi.

483
00:43:14,291 --> 00:43:16,782
-How did you know it was me?
-Who else?

484
00:43:17,061 --> 00:43:19,996
-How are you feeling?
-A little disoriented.

485
00:43:20,164 --> 00:43:23,156
Horse tranquilizers
will do that for you.

486
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:26,663
-I cant believe you let them do this.
-They didnt ask.

487
00:43:26,837 --> 00:43:30,637
They called on the way, told me
their plan. I saw you off.

488
00:43:30,808 --> 00:43:31,797
From where?

489
00:43:31,976 --> 00:43:35,776
I helped them get you on the plane.
Theyre organized.

490
00:43:35,946 --> 00:43:40,576
They even had a note from a doctor.
Your pills are in your bag.

491
00:43:41,518 --> 00:43:43,543
-I have a bag?
-In the closet.

492
00:43:44,221 --> 00:43:47,281
-Tell Connor we say hello.
-Did you hear that?

493
00:43:47,458 --> 00:43:51,588
Ill tell you one thing, meeting
them explains a lot about you.

494
00:43:51,762 --> 00:43:54,424
-Such as?
-Let me put it this way.

495
00:43:54,598 --> 00:43:57,863
Youre more normal than
you have any right to be.

496
00:44:11,181 --> 00:44:13,206
Whyd you do that?

497
00:44:14,018 --> 00:44:17,454
Theyll explain it all to you
at the Betty.

498
00:44:22,893 --> 00:44:27,592
Im gonna try and bust out tomorrow.
I gotta get back for work.

499
00:44:27,765 --> 00:44:30,290
Dont rush back on my account.

500
00:44:30,467 --> 00:44:32,367
I just said it was for work.

501
00:44:32,536 --> 00:44:37,564
Maybe you ought to fix this thing
with your mother once and for all.

502
00:44:38,375 --> 00:44:41,003
Why are you so worried about this?

503
00:44:41,211 --> 00:44:45,944
Because Im afraid that one day our kids
may feel that way about you.

504
00:44:47,885 --> 00:44:52,322
These women may be nuts, but
they might know something you dont.

505
00:44:52,523 --> 00:44:57,324
Its not fair bringing kids we dont
have into this. Thats a low blow.

506
00:44:57,494 --> 00:44:59,291
Thats the way I feel.

507
00:44:59,463 --> 00:45:01,761
Stay there. Deal with it.

508
00:45:04,835 --> 00:45:06,097
You deal with it.

509
00:45:09,239 --> 00:45:11,264
Dont New Yorkers say goodbye?

510
00:45:11,442 --> 00:45:15,003
Not when theyre on their high horse
thinking they know so much.

511
00:45:15,179 --> 00:45:17,977
I hate that.
Especially when theyre right.

512
00:45:18,882 --> 00:45:21,749
Whenever Charlies right,
I just ignore him.

513
00:45:21,919 --> 00:45:25,150
-Yall ignored him, right or wrong.
-Not really.

514
00:45:25,322 --> 00:45:29,759
Like hell we didnt. Took me 25 years
to notice my husband was gay.

515
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:32,988
They just couldnt keep up with us.

516
00:45:33,163 --> 00:45:35,597
I think we created our own world...

517
00:45:35,766 --> 00:45:38,599
...where we still live happily
to this day.

518
00:45:38,769 --> 00:45:40,361
Ya-Ya.

519
00:45:40,537 --> 00:45:43,904
I wonder if Mama would have
ignored Jack like Daddy.

520
00:45:44,074 --> 00:45:47,771
No way, pal.
Jack was the love of her life.

521
00:45:47,945 --> 00:45:50,914
-The kind you only get once.
-What happened?

522
00:45:51,115 --> 00:45:53,777
How did Daddy wind up in the hot seat?

523
00:46:04,795 --> 00:46:06,092
Viv.

524
00:46:06,463 --> 00:46:07,452
Vivo.

525
00:46:11,535 --> 00:46:14,663
Come on, we have to go
to Teensys house.

526
00:46:16,673 --> 00:46:18,834
-No.
-Come on.

527
00:46:21,678 --> 00:46:24,704
I knowed something bad was coming.

528
00:46:24,882 --> 00:46:28,477
Just yesterday,
I done heared that screech owl.

529
00:46:32,556 --> 00:46:36,253
You killed my baby!
You killed my baby!

530
00:46:38,061 --> 00:46:40,222
You drink champagne to his death.

531
00:46:40,798 --> 00:46:45,064
You killed him, sure enough,
you killed my baby!

532
00:47:22,272 --> 00:47:25,639
I dont think I can take any more.

533
00:47:25,809 --> 00:47:27,299
Me neither.

534
00:47:28,779 --> 00:47:31,304
I think I need to go home.

535
00:47:31,481 --> 00:47:34,006
Are you all right to drive?

536
00:47:35,953 --> 00:47:38,513
-Of course I am.
-Habit.

537
00:47:39,723 --> 00:47:41,691
See yall tomorrow.

538
00:47:44,494 --> 00:47:47,258
Wasnt all just fun and games.

539
00:47:47,431 --> 00:47:50,366
-So I see.
-Shall I make a long story short?

540
00:47:50,534 --> 00:47:54,300
They never found his body.
Not a dog tag, a shoe, nothing.

541
00:47:54,471 --> 00:47:58,567
Genevieve got herself believing
for a while...

542
00:47:58,742 --> 00:48:03,179
...that it was all a mistake.
He was still alive, somewhere.

543
00:48:03,347 --> 00:48:06,578
Then she stopped believing,
and then...

544
00:48:07,918 --> 00:48:10,409
...the good French lady...

545
00:48:11,121 --> 00:48:13,089
...took her leave.

546
00:48:14,958 --> 00:48:18,519
I knew I shouldve stopped
while I was behind.

547
00:48:24,167 --> 00:48:25,429
Poor Teens.

548
00:48:25,602 --> 00:48:29,504
Your mama rallied for her,
but the two of them...

549
00:48:29,673 --> 00:48:33,131
...neither of them was ever the same.

550
00:48:33,310 --> 00:48:37,508
I wish you could have known
what your mother was like as a girl.

551
00:48:37,681 --> 00:48:42,482
-You wouldve loved her.
-Not loving her was never the problem.

552
00:48:42,653 --> 00:48:45,850
Her not loving you
was never the problem either.

553
00:48:46,023 --> 00:48:48,082
Well, what about Daddy?

554
00:48:48,258 --> 00:48:51,989
Was she ever in love?
Or was he around for heavy lifting?

555
00:48:52,162 --> 00:48:54,130
Your daddy knew Jack.

556
00:48:54,298 --> 00:49:00,032
He said hed rather play second fiddle
than not play in the band at all.

557
00:49:00,203 --> 00:49:04,230
He thought he loved her enough
for both of them. Maybe he did.

558
00:49:04,408 --> 00:49:05,739
Does.

559
00:49:08,645 --> 00:49:09,634
Well...

560
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:14,177
...I gots some work to do
at the woodpile, honey.

561
00:49:14,384 --> 00:49:17,148
Lets call it a night, shall we?

562
00:49:20,290 --> 00:49:21,484
Night.

563
00:50:46,209 --> 00:50:47,870
Smells good.

564
00:51:03,994 --> 00:51:06,189
Now whats wrong, Vivi?

565
00:51:08,165 --> 00:51:09,826
Im still not Jack?

566
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:11,262
Shut up, Shep.

567
00:51:11,435 --> 00:51:15,462
How long you gonna make us
suffer something that cant change?

568
00:51:18,542 --> 00:51:19,873
Fine!

569
00:51:27,317 --> 00:51:30,912
-Gonna feed your children?
-I dont care if you starve.

570
00:51:39,396 --> 00:51:40,727
Hey, kid.

571
00:51:41,498 --> 00:51:44,592
-III make dinner, Daddy, okay?
-Thank you.

572
00:51:46,736 --> 00:51:49,296
Ill get the skillet. Dont touch it.

573
00:51:50,340 --> 00:51:53,537
...one: its quiet,
two: theres any room for me!

574
00:51:53,710 --> 00:51:57,043
What? You go out there
and drink yourself to sleep!

575
00:51:57,247 --> 00:52:00,148
You dont lift one finger
to help this family!

576
00:52:00,283 --> 00:52:02,683
I dont? Look at my hands!

577
00:52:02,886 --> 00:52:07,880
I dont want to look at your ugly
hands, or you to put them on me!

578
00:52:08,091 --> 00:52:13,051
Dont worry! Drunk as you are all the
time, I dont want to be in the house.

579
00:52:13,230 --> 00:52:17,758
Youre disgusting!
God, I hate you, Shep! I hate you!

580
00:52:17,934 --> 00:52:21,927
-Is Daddy gonna kill her?
-Shell kill him first.

581
00:52:44,961 --> 00:52:45,928
Hi.

582
00:52:46,163 --> 00:52:48,996
-Why do you answer like that?
-Like what?

583
00:52:49,166 --> 00:52:52,158
-Like you know its me.
-But it is you.

584
00:52:52,335 --> 00:52:55,793
I thought about what you said.
I know what you mean.

585
00:52:55,972 --> 00:52:58,497
Your tone makes me think you dont.

586
00:52:58,675 --> 00:53:01,473
Why would my kids feel that way
if I wasnt unfit?

587
00:53:01,678 --> 00:53:04,374
-Our kids.
-lf I wasnt in some way damaged?

588
00:53:04,581 --> 00:53:07,948
-Thats what youre saying!
-Not even close.

589
00:53:08,118 --> 00:53:11,178
Theres no logic?
You simply said it to hurt me?

590
00:53:11,388 --> 00:53:13,288
Youre right. How can I know?

591
00:53:13,456 --> 00:53:16,220
-So why risk it? Know what I mean?
-No.

592
00:53:16,393 --> 00:53:21,126
Why risk doing to my children and you
what Mama did to me and Daddy?

593
00:53:21,298 --> 00:53:23,823
Ask him about his life
while youre at it.

594
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:25,126
At what?

595
00:53:25,302 --> 00:53:29,602
Figuring out if III ruin the lives
of our hypothetical children.

596
00:53:29,773 --> 00:53:33,709
Okay, Sidda? No shit?
Youre scaring me. Calm down.

597
00:53:33,877 --> 00:53:37,176
Do not start that patronizing
Youre crazy now...

598
00:53:37,347 --> 00:53:41,613
...so I wont make any sudden
moves till youre finishedthing.

599
00:53:45,589 --> 00:53:47,921
-See? Youre doing it!
-Okay! Uncle!

600
00:53:48,091 --> 00:53:52,824
Im painted into a corner where
nothing I say could be right.

601
00:53:52,996 --> 00:53:56,762
You want to live painted
into a corner by an unfit mother?

602
00:53:56,933 --> 00:53:59,458
No, no, no!
I never said I wanted that.

603
00:53:59,636 --> 00:54:02,935
Ill make this easy.
Put this whole thing on hold...

604
00:54:03,106 --> 00:54:06,940
...while you figure out how badly
III fuck up everybodys life.

605
00:54:07,110 --> 00:54:09,135
Do not send those invitations!

606
00:54:09,312 --> 00:54:15,774
Siddalee Walker? You are on the verge
of making a big mistake right now.

607
00:54:15,952 --> 00:54:19,786
Well, so are you.
Only Im not gonna let you.

608
00:54:31,134 --> 00:54:33,602
Did she just call off our god...?

609
00:54:35,605 --> 00:54:37,436
I dont have the number!

610
00:54:37,607 --> 00:54:40,474
I dont have the goddamn number!

611
00:54:42,912 --> 00:54:44,573
Okay. Vivi.

612
00:54:49,653 --> 00:54:51,143
-Hello?
-Vivi?

613
00:54:51,354 --> 00:54:53,345
This is Connor.

614
00:54:56,126 --> 00:54:57,593
I dont...

615
00:55:02,299 --> 00:55:04,859
-What?
-Emergency, Vivi! Do not hang up!

616
00:55:05,035 --> 00:55:06,502
Oh, my God! Oh, no!

617
00:55:06,670 --> 00:55:10,128
No! Not that. I just need
a phone number from you.

618
00:55:10,774 --> 00:55:12,207
My God!

619
00:55:12,375 --> 00:55:15,503
Dont you ever, ever, ever
do that to me again!

620
00:55:15,679 --> 00:55:21,049
Sorry, I think she just called off our
goddamn life. I dont have the number!

621
00:55:21,184 --> 00:55:22,981
What are you talking about?

622
00:55:23,186 --> 00:55:27,623
Shes with those friends of yours,
the Yo-yos, or Yee-haws...

623
00:55:27,791 --> 00:55:30,726
The Ya-Yas?
Why would she run off with them?

624
00:55:30,894 --> 00:55:34,125
She didnt run off.
They came here and took her!

625
00:55:34,297 --> 00:55:37,664
Oh, for Petes sake. I gotta go.

626
00:55:42,939 --> 00:55:43,928
Yes?

627
00:55:44,107 --> 00:55:46,667
I dont know
if you ruined Siddas life.

628
00:55:46,843 --> 00:55:49,676
But I do know that now
youre ruining mine!

629
00:55:49,846 --> 00:55:52,246
And your phone etiquette sucks!

630
00:55:53,917 --> 00:55:55,441
He hung up on me.

631
00:56:08,398 --> 00:56:10,696
Oh, what a surprise!

632
00:56:11,167 --> 00:56:16,230
Look what the backstabbing,
traitorous cats dragged in!

633
00:56:17,140 --> 00:56:19,108
Oh, look who it is!

634
00:56:19,509 --> 00:56:22,569
All my old ex-friends!

635
00:56:22,779 --> 00:56:26,078
And the biological fruit
of my womb that rotted!

636
00:56:38,728 --> 00:56:40,218
Oh, shit.

637
00:56:45,135 --> 00:56:46,124
What?

638
00:56:47,837 --> 00:56:49,896
-Hi, honey!
-Hi!

639
00:56:50,440 --> 00:56:52,067
Pull over!

640
00:56:52,275 --> 00:56:53,936
I cant hear you!

641
00:56:54,444 --> 00:56:55,433
Pull over!

642
00:57:06,089 --> 00:57:07,989
-Pull over, Vivi.
-No!

643
00:57:08,158 --> 00:57:10,092
Pull over, Vivi!

644
00:57:10,260 --> 00:57:11,318
Fuck off!

645
00:57:24,841 --> 00:57:27,241
Go ahead, warn them.

646
00:57:27,877 --> 00:57:30,368
Give them time to scatter like rats!

647
00:57:32,148 --> 00:57:33,137
Oh, my God!

648
00:57:41,391 --> 00:57:42,949
You are so lucky.

649
00:57:43,126 --> 00:57:46,584
If you put one scratch on my baby,
Id have your ass.

650
00:57:46,763 --> 00:57:51,063
I demand that you move
this piece of shit out of my way...

651
00:57:51,234 --> 00:57:53,361
...this very instant!

652
00:57:53,837 --> 00:57:57,568
-Who do you think youre talking to?
-I know shes there.

653
00:57:57,740 --> 00:58:01,608
Now what is going on?
Is betrayal absolutely everywhere?

654
00:58:01,778 --> 00:58:02,767
Yes.

655
00:58:02,946 --> 00:58:07,542
Your lifelong friends are programming
your daughter to destroy you.

656
00:58:07,750 --> 00:58:10,651
Somebody better tell me
whats going on.

657
00:58:10,820 --> 00:58:12,845
Vivi, calm down.

658
00:58:13,089 --> 00:58:15,922
Youre just gonna have to trust us!

659
00:58:16,092 --> 00:58:20,859
If you go there now,
youre gonna ruin everybodys life.

660
00:58:21,030 --> 00:58:24,898
What is it with me
ruining everybodys life?

661
00:58:25,068 --> 00:58:28,367
Everybody, Teensy?
Strangers are saying it now.

662
00:58:28,805 --> 00:58:32,206
-What strangers?
-Connor. He yelled at me.

663
00:58:32,375 --> 00:58:35,742
Shes walked out on their life,
whatever that means.

664
00:58:35,912 --> 00:58:37,812
Go! Go home. Now.

665
00:58:37,981 --> 00:58:41,439
Ill knock you into the middle
of next week.

666
00:58:41,618 --> 00:58:44,280
Then III kick your sorry ass
on Thursday.

667
00:58:44,487 --> 00:58:47,513
Now get in the goddamn car
and go home!

668
00:58:59,802 --> 00:59:01,463
Piece of shit.

669
00:59:02,572 --> 00:59:06,269
Thats ridiculous!
I dont think thats what he meant.

670
00:59:06,442 --> 00:59:09,969
Listen, kids, we got to slow down
or III pop a lung.

671
00:59:10,146 --> 00:59:13,343
Siddo, you come by your flair
for drama honestly...

672
00:59:13,550 --> 00:59:15,848
...but you dont call off a wedding...

673
00:59:16,052 --> 00:59:19,385
...and a 7-year relationship
based on a phone call.

674
00:59:19,556 --> 00:59:22,992
Especially after the goofballs
we had you hopped up on.

675
00:59:23,192 --> 00:59:24,591
Stop! I got to rest.

676
00:59:24,761 --> 00:59:26,991
I didnt. That wasnt why.

677
00:59:27,163 --> 00:59:30,360
Dont you think its fishy
were not married yet?

678
00:59:30,533 --> 00:59:33,991
He started asking the first year.
I always resisted.

679
00:59:34,170 --> 00:59:36,900
-Why is that fishy?
-Because!

680
00:59:37,073 --> 00:59:39,098
Something must be wrong.

681
00:59:39,275 --> 00:59:43,302
Ive hit the snooze button
on my biological clock a long time!

682
00:59:43,479 --> 00:59:45,743
On paper it works out.
You saw him.

683
00:59:45,949 --> 00:59:48,179
Who wouldnt want babies with him?

684
00:59:48,384 --> 00:59:51,842
Every time I get right down to it,
something stops me.

685
00:59:52,055 --> 00:59:55,081
-Just stops.
-And you dont have any idea why?

686
00:59:55,258 --> 00:59:58,125
Well, I have an idea why.

687
00:59:58,928 --> 01:00:02,295
What if Im like her,
and I get into it, and just...

688
01:00:03,533 --> 01:00:04,693
What?

689
01:00:07,136 --> 01:00:09,798
Beat everybody and then run away.

690
01:00:09,973 --> 01:00:13,875
-Thats what you think happened?
-What do you mean,think?

691
01:00:14,043 --> 01:00:17,774
This isnt some recovered memory.
I wish I could forget.

692
01:00:17,947 --> 01:00:21,439
You have Ya-Ya scars.
Thats nothing compared to mine.

693
01:00:21,651 --> 01:00:24,984
If theres one drop of that in me,
Im better off alone.

694
01:00:25,154 --> 01:00:29,454
No child should find that out the
hard way. Neither should Connor.

695
01:00:29,626 --> 01:00:33,494
Fine, she didnt want us.
She shouldve stayed gone.

696
01:00:33,663 --> 01:00:37,963
But yall dragged her back here,
and she drank until we went away.

697
01:00:38,134 --> 01:00:41,968
Yall should know,
since you were mixing the drinks!

698
01:00:43,473 --> 01:00:47,933
My God, she doesnt know anything,
does she?

699
01:00:57,220 --> 01:01:01,247
Sidda! Go get Lulu.
Baylor, get in the car.

700
01:01:01,424 --> 01:01:05,451
We are leaving. I cant stay
in this house one more second!

701
01:01:05,628 --> 01:01:08,893
I cant stand it! I cant!

702
01:01:59,682 --> 01:02:03,311
Mary! Mother of the motherless.

703
01:02:05,455 --> 01:02:06,786
Can you see me?

704
01:02:07,223 --> 01:02:08,588
Im here!

705
01:02:10,393 --> 01:02:12,088
Its me again.

706
01:02:12,628 --> 01:02:16,086
I need divine intervention once again.

707
01:02:20,103 --> 01:02:21,832
And here it is.

708
01:02:22,538 --> 01:02:27,407
My oldest daughter, Siddalee,
the one Ive been complaining about?

709
01:02:27,577 --> 01:02:29,101
The loudmouth?

710
01:02:30,747 --> 01:02:34,046
She may be walking away
from true love.

711
01:02:34,217 --> 01:02:36,549
Please stop her.

712
01:02:37,153 --> 01:02:39,144
Dont let her run away.

713
01:02:40,223 --> 01:02:41,690
This is because of me.

714
01:02:42,358 --> 01:02:45,384
She never said it, but I know.

715
01:02:46,062 --> 01:02:49,122
Shes only seen me holding back.

716
01:02:51,734 --> 01:02:53,861
I take full responsibility.

717
01:02:55,138 --> 01:02:58,437
But Id appreciate you
keeping that to yourself.

718
01:02:58,608 --> 01:03:02,339
Please pass this on
to your Son and his Father.

719
01:03:03,379 --> 01:03:07,213
I will only smoke once...

720
01:03:08,017 --> 01:03:09,382
...a day.

721
01:03:10,453 --> 01:03:14,150
And III only have a drink
once a week, I mean, a day.

722
01:03:14,891 --> 01:03:17,257
Ill do the best I can.

723
01:03:18,294 --> 01:03:22,663
If you will just help her out
with this one thing...

724
01:03:22,832 --> 01:03:25,699
...III make it up to you somehow.

725
01:05:50,112 --> 01:05:52,376
-Daddy.
-Hey, butterbean.

726
01:05:52,548 --> 01:05:56,314
Look at you.
You look pretty good for a hostage.

727
01:05:56,485 --> 01:05:59,181
Well, my captors are humane.

728
01:06:00,022 --> 01:06:02,855
Youre holding up
pretty well yourself.

729
01:06:03,025 --> 01:06:06,017
Well. Another fine mess.

730
01:06:06,195 --> 01:06:07,423
Yeah.

731
01:06:08,164 --> 01:06:12,066
The best lesson I ever learned
from you was to lay low.

732
01:06:12,201 --> 01:06:13,429
What happened?

733
01:06:13,636 --> 01:06:18,471
Security has been breached,
backups have been called in.

734
01:06:18,641 --> 01:06:20,768
Full-scale Ya-Ya alert.

735
01:06:20,943 --> 01:06:25,073
But the prisoner
has been left unattended.

736
01:06:25,247 --> 01:06:28,011
-You could bust me out.
-I could.

737
01:06:28,184 --> 01:06:31,551
But then wherever we go,
wed still be there.

738
01:06:31,921 --> 01:06:35,584
-No escape.
-More like Stockholm syndrome.

739
01:06:35,758 --> 01:06:38,693
That is you. What about me?

740
01:06:39,762 --> 01:06:42,322
Youll end up as the leader.

741
01:06:42,832 --> 01:06:46,097
The inmate takes over the asylum.

742
01:06:50,172 --> 01:06:51,469
What?

743
01:06:53,142 --> 01:06:56,543
Never mind. Never mind.

744
01:06:59,281 --> 01:07:02,876
What? Why am I
being hauled into court?

745
01:07:03,219 --> 01:07:06,313
Im not the one engaging
in acts of treachery.

746
01:07:06,489 --> 01:07:09,890
Thats a matter for some debate.

747
01:07:10,059 --> 01:07:12,527
The jurys still out, pal.

748
01:07:12,895 --> 01:07:14,760
Your kids arent writers.

749
01:07:14,930 --> 01:07:17,922
Theyre not exposing
your darkest secrets...

750
01:07:18,100 --> 01:07:20,466
...as entertainment for the masses.

751
01:07:20,636 --> 01:07:24,072
If I knew she would be a writer,
I never would have...

752
01:07:24,273 --> 01:07:26,173
-What?
-Goddamn it!

753
01:07:26,342 --> 01:07:29,800
Will you stop thinking
about how itll make you look?

754
01:07:30,012 --> 01:07:32,378
Think what youre saying.
She has no idea.

755
01:07:32,548 --> 01:07:35,381
I cant believe yall
are doing this to me.

756
01:07:35,551 --> 01:07:39,043
-She knows too much as it is.
-She doesnt know shit.

757
01:07:39,221 --> 01:07:42,019
What she knows,
shes made the worst of it.

758
01:07:42,191 --> 01:07:46,821
Its like this, pal. If you dont
tell her, we will. Case closed.

759
01:07:46,996 --> 01:07:49,521
-This is not the Ya-Ya way.
-It is now.

760
01:07:49,965 --> 01:07:51,227
Ya-Ya.

761
01:07:51,400 --> 01:07:53,197
Now, lets eat.

762
01:07:55,871 --> 01:07:57,862
We were ill-equipped.

763
01:07:58,774 --> 01:08:03,973
It can be summed up in,The road
to hell is paved with good intentions.

764
01:08:06,315 --> 01:08:09,512
What about the road back?
Whats that paved with?

765
01:08:09,685 --> 01:08:10,982
Humility.

766
01:08:11,153 --> 01:08:12,279
Really?

767
01:08:12,555 --> 01:08:15,353
Does she even have that
in her repertoire?

768
01:08:15,524 --> 01:08:18,152
Not that shed care to admit.

769
01:08:18,461 --> 01:08:21,123
Pride covers a multitude of sins.

770
01:08:22,364 --> 01:08:25,265
But you live with someone
long enough...

771
01:08:25,468 --> 01:08:28,665
...you can see
what theyre trying to hide...

772
01:08:28,838 --> 01:08:31,466
...by the way they try to hide it.

773
01:08:34,243 --> 01:08:37,041
Shes hurting too, baby girl.

774
01:08:43,419 --> 01:08:44,681
Daddy?

775
01:08:45,821 --> 01:08:48,187
Did you get loved enough?

776
01:08:51,127 --> 01:08:52,788
Whats enough?

777
01:08:55,364 --> 01:08:56,991
My question is...

778
01:08:57,933 --> 01:08:59,264
...did you?

779
01:09:06,175 --> 01:09:08,439
Its never too late.

780
01:09:24,894 --> 01:09:27,089
Youve reached Connor and Sidda.

781
01:09:27,263 --> 01:09:30,130
Leave a message
and we will call you back.

782
01:09:31,100 --> 01:09:32,362
Hi.

783
01:11:09,598 --> 01:11:13,557
Im very sorry to bother you so late.
Are you Mr. Walker?

784
01:11:13,802 --> 01:11:16,430
-Depends.
-Im Connor McGill.

785
01:11:16,672 --> 01:11:19,698
Im supposed to marry Sidda?
But she was...

786
01:11:19,942 --> 01:11:23,503
-...abducted by some friends of yours...
-Save your breath.

787
01:11:23,979 --> 01:11:25,970
Its not my department.

788
01:11:26,215 --> 01:11:32,620
Come on in. Vivi Walker, Connor
McGill. Shell take over from here.

789
01:11:33,489 --> 01:11:34,888
Good luck.

790
01:11:37,192 --> 01:11:39,023
Night-night.

791
01:11:40,129 --> 01:11:45,465
Why am I just meeting you now, Connor?
Is that her doing or yours?

792
01:11:45,668 --> 01:11:48,603
You know the answer to that.

793
01:11:49,872 --> 01:11:53,308
Did she say she was
calling the whole thing off?

794
01:11:53,509 --> 01:11:58,947
Did she use those exact words? No, she
said,Dont mail out the invitations.

795
01:11:59,181 --> 01:12:02,412
But she didnt say burn them
or throw them out.

796
01:12:02,618 --> 01:12:05,246
Its taken years to nail down a date.

797
01:12:05,454 --> 01:12:08,946
She saysWhy rush?, or
Things are good, why change?

798
01:12:09,158 --> 01:12:15,222
I dont know what shes afraid of.
She thinks the bottom will drop out.

799
01:12:16,432 --> 01:12:20,869
You know why she thinks that,
dont you, honey?

800
01:12:22,504 --> 01:12:24,369
Because it did.

801
01:12:26,408 --> 01:12:28,103
It always did.

802
01:12:32,781 --> 01:12:34,646
What? What is it?

803
01:12:38,487 --> 01:12:39,886
Put your arms up.

804
01:12:40,989 --> 01:12:42,149
Take a sip.

805
01:12:46,862 --> 01:12:49,729
Sorry. I thought it was water.

806
01:12:50,332 --> 01:12:53,665
Lulu and Baylor are sick.
Baylor pooped in bed.

807
01:12:55,137 --> 01:12:58,732
Baylor, God! Come on!
Get in the bathtub.

808
01:12:58,974 --> 01:13:02,637
-Get out of those pants!
-Im sorry. I didnt mean to!

809
01:13:02,845 --> 01:13:05,609
Dont cough and help
with your brother!

810
01:13:05,814 --> 01:13:09,147
-Baylor, we have to be a good boy.
-My tummy hurts.

811
01:13:09,351 --> 01:13:12,047
We have to take your temperature.

812
01:13:12,254 --> 01:13:14,745
-God, Lulu!
-Im sorry, Mommy.

813
01:13:14,957 --> 01:13:16,618
Throw up in the toilet!

814
01:13:16,825 --> 01:13:21,057
Wheres your father?
Why do I have to do everything myself?

815
01:13:21,663 --> 01:13:22,960
Stop!

816
01:13:24,900 --> 01:13:26,128
God!

817
01:13:28,070 --> 01:13:29,230
Mama.

818
01:13:31,640 --> 01:13:33,301
-Pick me up.
-Mama.

819
01:13:33,942 --> 01:13:35,375
Shut up!

820
01:13:39,148 --> 01:13:40,945
Mama, come here.

821
01:14:23,425 --> 01:14:24,687
Willetta.

822
01:14:25,594 --> 01:14:28,893
-Do you have any money?
-No, maam, I dont.

823
01:14:31,033 --> 01:14:34,525
Make Little Shep eat oatmeal,
or hell be in the cookies.

824
01:14:34,770 --> 01:14:37,238
Where you going in your fancy coat?

825
01:14:37,473 --> 01:14:42,410
-Confession. Im going for absolution.
-Watch out for cat-eyed priests.

826
01:14:42,611 --> 01:14:43,839
Be back in an hour.

827
01:14:51,453 --> 01:14:56,015
Bless me, Father, Ive sinned.
My last confession was two weeks ago.

828
01:14:56,258 --> 01:14:57,350
Go ahead.

829
01:14:57,559 --> 01:15:02,895
Father, I accuse myself of bad
thoughts toward my family.

830
01:15:03,098 --> 01:15:06,465
-Youve hated your husband?
-Yes, and my children.

831
01:15:06,668 --> 01:15:10,229
How many times have you borne
these thoughts?

832
01:15:10,472 --> 01:15:14,067
-Too many to count.
-What are these bad thoughts?

833
01:15:14,276 --> 01:15:16,039
In my thoughts...

834
01:15:16,245 --> 01:15:18,770
...I want to abandon my children.

835
01:15:19,882 --> 01:15:22,112
I want to injure my husband.

836
01:15:24,920 --> 01:15:27,184
I want to run away.

837
01:15:28,190 --> 01:15:31,057
I want to be unattached.

838
01:15:33,428 --> 01:15:35,396
I want to be famous.

839
01:15:36,298 --> 01:15:41,258
-You must banish these bad thoughts.
-What if I cant make them stop?

840
01:15:42,070 --> 01:15:45,801
Well then, ask Mary, the mother
of our blessed Lord...

841
01:15:46,575 --> 01:15:49,442
...to teach you to bear your
cross silently...

842
01:15:49,645 --> 01:15:53,081
...patiently, and in perfect
submission to the will of God.

843
01:18:02,444 --> 01:18:05,902
Good morning.
May I have some coffee, please?

844
01:18:06,148 --> 01:18:11,677
Yes. Thank... Wait.
Is today Thursday?

845
01:18:14,656 --> 01:18:15,850
Friday?

846
01:18:41,616 --> 01:18:44,710
Hi, darling. You okay?

847
01:18:46,621 --> 01:18:48,612
Im fine, honey.

848
01:18:51,259 --> 01:18:53,693
Sidda, honey, dont cry.

849
01:18:54,730 --> 01:18:56,891
How is everybody?

850
01:18:58,500 --> 01:19:00,627
All by yourself?

851
01:19:01,336 --> 01:19:04,464
Im very proud of you, honey.
Thats good.

852
01:19:08,210 --> 01:19:09,905
Im coming home.

853
01:19:10,779 --> 01:19:11,837
Today.

854
01:19:14,950 --> 01:19:18,113
How about we have shrimp for supper?

855
01:19:21,189 --> 01:19:22,850
I love you too.

856
01:19:24,659 --> 01:19:25,921
Bye-bye.

857
01:19:36,671 --> 01:19:39,538
Does she know about all this?

858
01:19:39,941 --> 01:19:42,375
She knew I was gone.

859
01:19:42,978 --> 01:19:47,039
Wasnt the first time.
I know she blames me.

860
01:19:47,249 --> 01:19:50,480
Of course she does,
just like I blame my mother.

861
01:19:50,685 --> 01:19:55,281
I didnt screw up her life any more
than my mother screwed up mine.

862
01:19:55,490 --> 01:19:58,015
She almost did.

863
01:19:59,127 --> 01:20:01,027
But all the real...

864
01:20:02,297 --> 01:20:04,925
...Iong-term damage...

865
01:20:06,334 --> 01:20:08,302
...I did to myself.

866
01:20:26,555 --> 01:20:27,783
Vivi.

867
01:20:29,024 --> 01:20:31,822
I just want the woman to marry me.

868
01:20:56,084 --> 01:20:57,346
Vivi?

869
01:20:58,753 --> 01:21:00,618
Did you knock?

870
01:21:02,958 --> 01:21:04,926
What is it, honey?

871
01:21:09,931 --> 01:21:12,661
-I had a question.
-Well...

872
01:21:22,377 --> 01:21:25,244
Well, whats the question, honey?

873
01:21:26,481 --> 01:21:28,847
Did I ruin your life?

874
01:21:30,518 --> 01:21:35,319
I always thought the story
was Id ruined yours.

875
01:21:37,392 --> 01:21:42,159
That may be another of the many lies
Ive told myself along the way.

876
01:21:42,364 --> 01:21:45,162
Vivi, youve made it interesting.

877
01:21:46,534 --> 01:21:51,938
I tried to keep up.
Then I tried to stay out of your way.

878
01:21:52,140 --> 01:21:58,409
But I knew the first time I saw you,
there was no one like you in the world.

879
01:22:00,282 --> 01:22:03,581
When I saidfor better or worse...

880
01:22:04,519 --> 01:22:07,511
...I knew it was a coin toss.

881
01:22:31,780 --> 01:22:33,213
Shep?

882
01:22:34,883 --> 01:22:36,851
Heads or tails?

883
01:22:38,787 --> 01:22:40,118
Your call.

884
01:22:54,602 --> 01:22:56,536
Is that Connor?

885
01:22:57,238 --> 01:23:00,105
-I believe it is.
-Lets stick to the plan.

886
01:23:00,709 --> 01:23:03,678
Youre just in time.
I made beignets.

887
01:23:03,878 --> 01:23:05,607
-Hi, Vivi.
-Look whos here.

888
01:23:05,814 --> 01:23:08,214
-Hello, Connor.
-Good morning, ladies.

889
01:23:08,516 --> 01:23:12,213
-Connor, why are you here?
-Ive come to get my bride.

890
01:23:12,420 --> 01:23:16,288
-Shell hate it if you call her that.
-Itll be our secret.

891
01:23:16,491 --> 01:23:21,519
-I understand secrets are Ya-Ya forte.
-Thats what we came to talk about.

892
01:23:22,297 --> 01:23:25,289
Vivi, I think you know what
were here for.

893
01:23:25,500 --> 01:23:27,695
Weve had this discussion.

894
01:23:27,969 --> 01:23:32,668
-I think I was perfectly clear.
-Perfectly clear and perfectly wrong.

895
01:23:33,541 --> 01:23:35,975
This is violently unfair.

896
01:23:36,177 --> 01:23:40,773
I have not ceded control of my private
life to you or anyone else.

897
01:23:40,982 --> 01:23:42,210
Honey.

898
01:23:42,584 --> 01:23:45,178
There is no shame in what happened.

899
01:23:45,387 --> 01:23:49,847
That was a different time, and you
were different. Theyre right.

900
01:23:50,058 --> 01:23:51,992
You can trust Sidda, honey.

901
01:23:52,193 --> 01:23:53,626
Come on, honey.

902
01:23:56,231 --> 01:23:57,960
Come with us.

903
01:23:59,467 --> 01:24:02,959
I cant. I cant be the one.

904
01:24:03,171 --> 01:24:07,039
I dont even remember most of it.

905
01:24:07,242 --> 01:24:09,767
I dont want to be the one.

906
01:24:13,782 --> 01:24:15,443
Okay, darling.

907
01:24:20,288 --> 01:24:24,384
Youll be glad, honey,
when this is over.

908
01:24:25,326 --> 01:24:28,420
-Im coming with you.
-Wait, you cant all go.

909
01:24:28,830 --> 01:24:30,821
Ill stay with you.

910
01:24:47,582 --> 01:24:48,879
Once...

911
01:24:50,151 --> 01:24:51,846
...a long time ago...

912
01:24:58,293 --> 01:25:00,318
...I dropped my basket.

913
01:25:08,336 --> 01:25:10,270
Hey, butterbean.

914
01:25:10,572 --> 01:25:12,540
Whats the problem?

915
01:25:12,774 --> 01:25:15,800
Nothing. Connors just not picking up.

916
01:25:20,648 --> 01:25:26,052
-What?
-Get comfortable. I got a full tank.

917
01:25:27,122 --> 01:25:31,525
When I got back, I quit drinking.

918
01:25:31,726 --> 01:25:35,423
-I tried to be the best mother I could.
-Howd that go?

919
01:25:36,764 --> 01:25:38,322
-Not so hot.
-Willetta!

920
01:25:38,533 --> 01:25:43,698
Get this monster! I cant stand him!
Dont look at me in that tone.

921
01:25:43,938 --> 01:25:45,599
-I wasnt.
-Well, dont!

922
01:25:50,245 --> 01:25:51,906
Hurry up. Get in there!

923
01:25:52,113 --> 01:25:55,173
I saw a priest, who sent
me to a doctor...

924
01:25:55,383 --> 01:25:58,944
...whos supposed to cure me
of the demon alcohol.

925
01:25:59,154 --> 01:26:00,416
Did it work?

926
01:26:07,595 --> 01:26:08,926
Shut up!

927
01:26:09,430 --> 01:26:12,365
Quit making all that goddamn noise!

928
01:26:15,069 --> 01:26:16,366
Monday.

929
01:26:17,005 --> 01:26:20,270
Wednesday, beggar man, thief.

930
01:26:20,842 --> 01:26:23,242
How many doctors will it...

931
01:26:23,878 --> 01:26:28,508
Im sure there are things you remember
that youd rather forget.

932
01:26:28,716 --> 01:26:31,446
We know you bore the brunt of it.

933
01:26:32,153 --> 01:26:33,381
Bear the brunt.

934
01:26:37,892 --> 01:26:40,952
I done a bad thing.

935
01:26:41,162 --> 01:26:45,861
-Heathcliff, I got a surprise for you.
-A surprise, Louie?

936
01:26:46,100 --> 01:26:49,331
Yeah. Close your eyes. Come on.

937
01:26:51,873 --> 01:26:55,570
-I didnt do anything.
-Outside, everybody.

938
01:26:55,710 --> 01:26:58,838
-Get out of those filthy rags!
-Its raining.

939
01:26:59,214 --> 01:27:01,910
Ill clean you up before he has a go.

940
01:27:02,116 --> 01:27:04,949
-I didnt do anything!
-I have to save you!

941
01:27:05,153 --> 01:27:08,611
-Oh, my God, Mama!
-God, help me!

942
01:27:08,823 --> 01:27:11,553
-Mama, wait!
-Its not time yet!

943
01:27:23,338 --> 01:27:24,965
Mama, let me find Daddy!

944
01:27:25,206 --> 01:27:26,195
Stop it!

945
01:27:28,243 --> 01:27:31,269
I see the moon and the moon sees me.

946
01:27:32,013 --> 01:27:34,481
-Get away from her!
-Im sorry, Mommy.

947
01:27:34,682 --> 01:27:37,116
-Come on, Lulu! Run!
-Im sorry.

948
01:27:42,991 --> 01:27:47,951
-Please, stop it, Mama!
-Hail Mary, full of face.

949
01:27:49,464 --> 01:27:51,022
No, Miss Vivi!

950
01:27:56,070 --> 01:28:00,734
-They need cleaning!
-They are clean. Clean as angels.

951
01:28:01,743 --> 01:28:05,338
-Get them in the truck, Willetta.
-Chaney, come on!

952
01:28:05,546 --> 01:28:09,312
We gotta try to find Mr. Shep!
She done lost her mind!

953
01:28:11,052 --> 01:28:14,351
Oh, my God, youre bleeding!
Get in the truck!

954
01:28:14,622 --> 01:28:18,490
Vivi, can you hear me? Come on. Vivi.

955
01:28:18,693 --> 01:28:20,558
Do you know what she took?

956
01:28:22,096 --> 01:28:25,657
-How many?
-No idea. She eats them like M&Ms.

957
01:28:25,867 --> 01:28:30,827
Dr. Lowell. That man ought to be
run out of town on a rail.

958
01:28:31,072 --> 01:28:33,563
Ill give her a mild tranquilizer.

959
01:28:35,643 --> 01:28:40,706
Shep, Vivis sick. She has cracked up.
We need to get her some real help.

960
01:28:51,659 --> 01:28:55,356
I can tell you what the problem is.
She doesnt eat.

961
01:29:01,235 --> 01:29:02,634
Shep?

962
01:29:02,904 --> 01:29:06,340
She wont eat now.
She doesnt know where she is.

963
01:29:06,541 --> 01:29:11,137
Its not gonna hurt to have something
in her stomach, now is it?

964
01:29:12,113 --> 01:29:13,410
Hey, baby.

965
01:29:25,626 --> 01:29:28,754
Its a B.L.T.
You got to take a bite, honey.

966
01:29:28,996 --> 01:29:31,931
Good, good. Chew, baby, yeah.

967
01:29:36,838 --> 01:29:38,066
Beau?

968
01:29:38,473 --> 01:29:42,466
Why dont you go on over
and see about the kids.

969
01:29:50,752 --> 01:29:52,014
Oh, baby.

970
01:29:59,627 --> 01:30:00,855
Vivi?

971
01:30:02,397 --> 01:30:03,591
Baby.

972
01:30:05,099 --> 01:30:06,464
Come on.

973
01:30:08,202 --> 01:30:09,726
Come here.

974
01:30:52,847 --> 01:30:54,542
Yeah? So?

975
01:30:55,817 --> 01:30:58,411
She didnt leave you, Siddo.

976
01:31:01,322 --> 01:31:03,347
She was sure as hell gone.

977
01:31:03,925 --> 01:31:06,325
She sure as hell was.

978
01:31:07,528 --> 01:31:11,862
"Dear Mama, I hope youre having a
nice time, wherever you are.

979
01:31:12,099 --> 01:31:15,899
We are being good, and I can
make Baylor be quiet now.

980
01:31:16,103 --> 01:31:19,095
So he wont get on your nerves.
I promise.

981
01:31:19,340 --> 01:31:21,968
So you can come home any time.

982
01:31:22,477 --> 01:31:25,344
Im sorry if we made you mad.

983
01:31:25,980 --> 01:31:29,541
I pray for you every night,
and every morning too.

984
01:31:29,750 --> 01:31:34,016
I miss you so very much.
And Daddy does too.

985
01:31:34,222 --> 01:31:39,421
Maybe I could come see you, and we
could go swimming, like old times. "

986
01:31:39,660 --> 01:31:40,922
Lulu, dont bite.

987
01:31:41,128 --> 01:31:44,359
"I love you,
and I will write again tomorrow. "

988
01:31:44,565 --> 01:31:46,226
Sit down, Daddy.

989
01:31:46,434 --> 01:31:49,232
"Yours truly, Siddalee. "

990
01:32:06,187 --> 01:32:10,487
It was six monthsinvoluntary
commitment, Sidda.

991
01:32:10,691 --> 01:32:15,754
And when she got back, we tried to get
her to talk about her breakdown.

992
01:32:15,963 --> 01:32:20,400
She refused and refuses to this day.

993
01:32:20,601 --> 01:32:26,471
Only once she made me tell her
how I found you and the kids.

994
01:32:27,575 --> 01:32:32,478
Every single mark on your bodies.
She was twisted with guilt.

995
01:32:32,680 --> 01:32:37,083
Honey, I think the reason she
stayed distant is...

996
01:32:37,285 --> 01:32:40,186
...she never trusted herself again.

997
01:32:40,655 --> 01:32:45,285
She didnt think she deserved you.
Everything else is an act, bebe.

998
01:32:45,560 --> 01:32:47,687
And those pills.

999
01:32:47,895 --> 01:32:52,389
Dexamyl. Half Dexedrine,
half Milltown.

1000
01:32:52,633 --> 01:32:56,228
It was supposed to cure drinking.
Nobody knew shit.

1001
01:32:56,737 --> 01:33:00,264
The thing I regret most...

1002
01:33:00,908 --> 01:33:06,175
...is that we didnt talk to you, or
Baylor, or Lulu, or Shep.

1003
01:33:06,981 --> 01:33:13,352
It was the belief that you dont
interfere with other peoples kids.

1004
01:33:16,657 --> 01:33:21,117
I wanted to tell you, honey.
A million times.

1005
01:33:21,329 --> 01:33:25,163
She made me swear
I would never tell a soul.

1006
01:33:29,003 --> 01:33:30,834
Speak, bebe.

1007
01:33:37,645 --> 01:33:38,976
Im just...

1008
01:33:39,747 --> 01:33:41,772
...adding up in my head the...

1009
01:33:42,083 --> 01:33:48,044
...thousands of dollars I spent on
therapy figuring out what I did wrong.

1010
01:33:49,690 --> 01:33:50,987
Shep?

1011
01:33:52,793 --> 01:33:54,988
Write her a check.

1012
01:34:02,670 --> 01:34:07,437
Well be cooking. We have your
mothers birthday party to throw.

1013
01:34:07,642 --> 01:34:08,768
Bye now, bebe.

1014
01:34:08,976 --> 01:34:11,171
-Bye, honey.
-Bye-bye, yall.

1015
01:34:16,150 --> 01:34:18,448
-You okay?
-Yeah.

1016
01:34:19,286 --> 01:34:22,380
It wasnt always bad, honey.
Do what I do.

1017
01:34:22,590 --> 01:34:26,856
Think about the good times.
Let that be what sticks with you.

1018
01:34:27,061 --> 01:34:30,121
-What are you, some kind of saint?
-Thats me.

1019
01:34:30,331 --> 01:34:35,064
Saint Shep of the fields.
Patron saint of sunflowers.

1020
01:34:36,270 --> 01:34:37,498
Bye.

1021
01:35:11,772 --> 01:35:14,605
-Sit down!
-Sit down!

1022
01:35:18,546 --> 01:35:21,947
All right, Sidda honey,
were gonna need tickets.

1023
01:35:22,149 --> 01:35:24,617
Go over there and stand in line.

1024
01:35:24,819 --> 01:35:28,812
Get 12 children and two adults.
I need a strong man!

1025
01:35:29,356 --> 01:35:31,950
-Necie, youre not going up, right?
-No.

1026
01:35:32,159 --> 01:35:34,491
Teensy, youre high enough.

1027
01:35:34,695 --> 01:35:35,684
One more.

1028
01:35:35,896 --> 01:35:40,299
This little one is staying, and this
one is going. This is safe?

1029
01:35:40,501 --> 01:35:42,833
Safe as a baby carriage.

1030
01:35:43,070 --> 01:35:46,403
-Dont get saucy. Theyre my angels.
-Dont worry.

1031
01:35:46,607 --> 01:35:50,202
Its your turn, climb on in!
Come on, bebe, lets go!

1032
01:35:50,444 --> 01:35:51,604
I cant.

1033
01:35:52,513 --> 01:35:54,743
-Scared?
-Why dont you hop in?

1034
01:35:58,819 --> 01:36:00,480
You go if I go?

1035
01:36:01,689 --> 01:36:04,385
All right. Keep your eye on Baylor.

1036
01:36:21,208 --> 01:36:23,073
Dont try my patience.

1037
01:36:23,277 --> 01:36:26,440
Either tell me whats wrong
or forget it.

1038
01:36:26,647 --> 01:36:30,048
-I want to ride in the airplane.
-Why didnt you?

1039
01:36:31,185 --> 01:36:32,709
I dont know.

1040
01:36:33,087 --> 01:36:34,281
Sidda.

1041
01:36:35,156 --> 01:36:37,090
I understand being afraid.

1042
01:36:37,291 --> 01:36:41,921
But nobody ever got anywhere
by being frightened all the time.

1043
01:36:42,129 --> 01:36:45,360
When I think
of all the stuff I never...

1044
01:36:52,473 --> 01:36:57,775
Want to ride in that airplane? And you
cant live with yourself if you dont?

1045
01:36:57,978 --> 01:36:59,969
Thats exactly it.

1046
01:37:02,016 --> 01:37:03,984
All right then.

1047
01:37:05,586 --> 01:37:07,747
Whos honking that horn?

1048
01:37:08,122 --> 01:37:11,819
Sidda and I are going to see a man
about an airplane.

1049
01:37:12,059 --> 01:37:13,424
Hi there.

1050
01:37:15,062 --> 01:37:19,590
I know you must be utterly exhausted
after such a long day...

1051
01:37:19,800 --> 01:37:23,759
...but could you consider one
more ride, for my daughter?

1052
01:37:23,871 --> 01:37:26,271
-No. Sorry.
-Please?

1053
01:37:26,507 --> 01:37:31,206
She panicked before, and now
shes dying to go up. Ill pay you.

1054
01:37:31,512 --> 01:37:33,980
Maam, I have to go to Baton Rouge.

1055
01:37:34,181 --> 01:37:39,710
Then fly to Macon, Georgia, in the
morning. Ive been here since 7:00 a.m.

1056
01:37:39,920 --> 01:37:42,787
But I can pay you a whole $1 .18.

1057
01:37:42,990 --> 01:37:47,984
Lady, $1 .18 wont cover the gas
to get us off the ground.

1058
01:37:49,563 --> 01:37:55,524
Well be back. With money. You just
stay right there. Please, dont go.

1059
01:37:56,570 --> 01:37:57,730
Christ.

1060
01:38:02,309 --> 01:38:04,777
I need some cash, Lyle.

1061
01:38:05,846 --> 01:38:09,839
Charge $15 to Sheps account.
Actually, make it $20.

1062
01:38:10,050 --> 01:38:11,711
Sorry, I cant do that.

1063
01:38:11,919 --> 01:38:15,286
Why not?
Youve done it 84,000 times before.

1064
01:38:15,489 --> 01:38:19,789
Shep told me I can give you all
the gas and service you want...

1065
01:38:19,994 --> 01:38:23,293
...but no more cash.
Due to all the times before.

1066
01:38:23,497 --> 01:38:28,457
Its not what you think. Be a
sweetheart, and itll stay between us.

1067
01:38:28,669 --> 01:38:31,968
He said just gas, no cash.
He pays the bills.

1068
01:38:32,206 --> 01:38:36,575
Its okay, Mama, never mind.
Lets give up and go on home.

1069
01:38:37,678 --> 01:38:39,441
Siddalee Walker.

1070
01:38:40,080 --> 01:38:45,484
Dont you ever let me hear you utter
those words again! Do you understand?

1071
01:38:45,786 --> 01:38:47,777
Come on, get out of the car.

1072
01:38:51,025 --> 01:38:55,985
I have a proposition for you. How much
gas are you buying this afternoon?

1073
01:38:56,196 --> 01:38:57,925
Im filling up.

1074
01:38:58,232 --> 01:39:02,635
Let me put it on my husbands charge
account, and pay me cash.

1075
01:39:02,836 --> 01:39:04,133
What do you say?

1076
01:39:04,905 --> 01:39:07,533
Okay. I see what youre saying.

1077
01:39:07,775 --> 01:39:11,905
Cause Im married to a tight-fisted
son of a bitch myself.

1078
01:39:12,146 --> 01:39:13,704
Have a wonderful day.

1079
01:39:13,914 --> 01:39:17,475
Lyle! Youve been outsmarted
once again!

1080
01:39:17,718 --> 01:39:24,089
Get your homely ass out of that chair
and pump this lovely woman a tankful.

1081
01:40:10,070 --> 01:40:12,095
Which way is your house?

1082
01:40:15,009 --> 01:40:16,169
That way.

1083
01:40:23,350 --> 01:40:25,113
There it is. See it?

1084
01:40:45,539 --> 01:40:47,507
Isnt it like a fairyland?

1085
01:40:48,409 --> 01:40:51,537
Dont we live in the
most magical place?

1086
01:40:51,879 --> 01:40:57,112
Were like two angels, up in the sky,
smiling down on all our friends.

1087
01:41:09,430 --> 01:41:10,624
Hi.

1088
01:41:11,198 --> 01:41:13,996
You say that like you know its me.

1089
01:41:18,372 --> 01:41:19,532
It is you.

1090
01:41:36,423 --> 01:41:39,654
Maybe its good theres
a lot of people here.

1091
01:41:39,860 --> 01:41:44,024
-Stick by me. Shes putty in my hands.
-Watch your driving.

1092
01:41:44,965 --> 01:41:48,560
-Chaney.
-Siddalee Walker. Free at last.

1093
01:41:48,802 --> 01:41:50,736
Thank God Almighty.

1094
01:41:51,805 --> 01:41:53,136
Meet Connor.

1095
01:41:53,407 --> 01:41:55,705
-Willetta.
-Hello.

1096
01:42:01,448 --> 01:42:03,712
-You know Connor.
-Hi, Connor.

1097
01:42:04,718 --> 01:42:08,518
Come on, son, come with me.
Well meet the Walker men.

1098
01:42:33,347 --> 01:42:36,407
-Mama, that reporter...
-Nope.

1099
01:42:38,352 --> 01:42:40,786
Truth hurts, kiddo. Thats all.

1100
01:42:41,855 --> 01:42:44,346
Im sure I had it coming.

1101
01:42:44,558 --> 01:42:49,621
-Mama, l...
-There are some things for which...

1102
01:42:50,097 --> 01:42:53,032
...I dont expect to be forgiven.

1103
01:42:53,233 --> 01:42:55,224
Not by my children.

1104
01:42:57,404 --> 01:42:59,372
Not even by God.

1105
01:43:00,507 --> 01:43:04,841
There are some things for which
it would be ludicrous to say...

1106
01:43:05,145 --> 01:43:06,544
...Im sorry.

1107
01:43:08,682 --> 01:43:10,240
Itd be so...

1108
01:43:11,251 --> 01:43:12,684
So pale.

1109
01:43:13,720 --> 01:43:16,951
-I guess I owe you an apology...
-No, you dont.

1110
01:43:17,224 --> 01:43:18,714
Dont say it.

1111
01:43:19,193 --> 01:43:24,221
Ive been thinking about what Id say
to you, should we ever speak again.

1112
01:43:24,431 --> 01:43:30,563
I thought of all the mean things thatd
make you feel guilty. You know me.

1113
01:43:30,804 --> 01:43:34,968
I take a problem and chew on it until
all the flavors gone...

1114
01:43:35,209 --> 01:43:37,803
...and then I stick it in my hair.

1115
01:43:39,846 --> 01:43:42,542
And then it dawned on me.

1116
01:43:43,650 --> 01:43:45,709
All those years...

1117
01:43:46,753 --> 01:43:48,380
...that I prayed...

1118
01:43:48,689 --> 01:43:51,624
...that I begged on my hands
and knees...

1119
01:43:51,858 --> 01:43:55,555
...for God to make me more,
give me more...

1120
01:43:56,230 --> 01:43:57,959
...make me better...

1121
01:43:58,532 --> 01:44:00,397
...make me stronger...

1122
01:44:01,468 --> 01:44:03,163
...make me saner...

1123
01:44:05,439 --> 01:44:08,169
...make all my dreams come true...

1124
01:44:09,810 --> 01:44:11,869
I finally got an answer.

1125
01:44:14,414 --> 01:44:15,711
What?

1126
01:44:17,851 --> 01:44:19,045
You.

1127
01:44:23,557 --> 01:44:29,723
Right there in one person,
all Id ever wanted to be or do.

1128
01:44:30,197 --> 01:44:31,824
And there you are.

1129
01:44:32,332 --> 01:44:34,630
You came right through me...

1130
01:44:35,569 --> 01:44:37,833
...and I never even realized.

1131
01:44:38,071 --> 01:44:43,532
I hate it when its right in front of
your face and you miss it. Dont you?

1132
01:44:50,150 --> 01:44:53,642
-You goddamn marry that boy.
-I will.

1133
01:44:55,889 --> 01:45:01,828
I know I have theworst mother in the
worldprize sewed up and in the bag...

1134
01:45:02,029 --> 01:45:05,089
...but Id still like to be there.

1135
01:45:05,465 --> 01:45:06,727
Well.

1136
01:45:08,068 --> 01:45:10,263
Maybe we could have it here?

1137
01:45:13,073 --> 01:45:14,938
That would just be...

1138
01:45:16,476 --> 01:45:19,240
...convenient. I could walk to it.

1139
01:45:19,613 --> 01:45:20,910
You could.

1140
01:45:36,730 --> 01:45:40,257
Here.
Ive been waiting to give you that.

1141
01:45:40,801 --> 01:45:44,100
I almost lost it once,
but I got it back.

1142
01:45:50,877 --> 01:45:53,812
Its so beautiful, Mama. Thank you.

1143
01:45:55,782 --> 01:45:58,580
Theres one more thing I want to ask.

1144
01:45:58,785 --> 01:46:01,549
Then you go dance until
your socks melt.

1145
01:46:01,755 --> 01:46:03,017
Okay.

1146
01:46:03,623 --> 01:46:07,423
But I want you to be totally honest.

1147
01:46:08,562 --> 01:46:10,189
Are you sure?

1148
01:46:11,298 --> 01:46:13,198
-Yes.
-Okay.

1149
01:46:16,069 --> 01:46:19,197
Do I look like Ive gained weight?

1150
01:46:22,709 --> 01:46:26,839
No. Actually,
I think you may be too thin.

1151
01:46:27,047 --> 01:46:30,107
God love you, darling.

1152
01:46:31,651 --> 01:46:35,587
-Now you can go have some fun.
-Okay.

1153
01:46:45,031 --> 01:46:47,090
Shell love it.

1154
01:47:26,106 --> 01:47:29,200
Make a wish. Make a wish.

1155
01:47:40,320 --> 01:47:42,379
This way.

1156
01:47:44,057 --> 01:47:47,083
Put your game face on.

1157
01:47:52,332 --> 01:47:58,293
You are now in the inner sanctum
of the temple of the Ya-Ya. Enter.

1158
01:48:01,208 --> 01:48:04,143
Bring forth the petit.

1159
01:48:07,848 --> 01:48:11,215
As you have seen
the secret Ya-Ya documents...

1160
01:48:11,418 --> 01:48:14,785
...and heard secret Ya-Ya secrets...

1161
01:48:14,988 --> 01:48:19,891
...it is now time for you to give
yourself to nature...

1162
01:48:20,093 --> 01:48:22,391
...and heed the Ya-Ya call.

1163
01:48:22,562 --> 01:48:24,291
-Silence.
-Sorry.

1164
01:48:24,498 --> 01:48:30,266
You are about to be initiated
as an intimate of the secret order.

1165
01:48:30,871 --> 01:48:35,399
We wear headdresses of the queens
who have gone before us...

1166
01:48:35,642 --> 01:48:38,110
...who ask us to carry on their magic.

1167
01:48:38,311 --> 01:48:43,374
They come from Indian holy grounds,
the jungles of the ancients...

1168
01:48:43,583 --> 01:48:48,282
...the prairies of the Norwegians
and the shores of Gitchegoomi.

1169
01:48:48,488 --> 01:48:51,286
Gitchegoomi. Gitchegoomi.

1170
01:48:51,491 --> 01:48:56,224
Countess Singing Cloud,
bring forth the chalice.

1171
01:49:01,801 --> 01:49:05,737
-What the hell is this?
-This is the blood of our people.

1172
01:49:05,972 --> 01:49:10,432
The wolf people, the alligator people
and the crazy people...

1173
01:49:10,644 --> 01:49:15,411
...from whom we gain our strength
to rule all worlds.

1174
01:49:17,317 --> 01:49:20,684
-Are we gonna do that again?
-Hell, yes.

1175
01:49:20,887 --> 01:49:24,084
-Of course we are.
-Thats how diseases spread.

1176
01:49:24,291 --> 01:49:29,786
Honey, the only disease that could
survive our bloodstream is alcoholism.

1177
01:49:29,996 --> 01:49:33,625
Is that it? I cant tell
if thats a scar or wrinkle.

1178
01:49:33,867 --> 01:49:35,334
Thats a wrinkle.

1179
01:49:35,569 --> 01:49:38,538
-Theres some scars behind your ears.
-Shut up.

1180
01:49:38,772 --> 01:49:44,210
-Youre opening up old wounds for me?
-Old wounds heal, pal.

1181
01:49:46,813 --> 01:49:52,308
There are people in the world
to save you when you need saving...

1182
01:49:52,519 --> 01:49:55,249
...cover your ass
when it needs covering...

1183
01:49:55,455 --> 01:50:00,358
...and are always there
when you need someone to lean on.

1184
01:50:02,629 --> 01:50:05,894
We are the mighty Ya-Ya priestesses.

1185
01:50:06,099 --> 01:50:08,966
Let no man put us under.

1186
01:50:09,202 --> 01:50:15,198
Now our blood flows through each other
as it has for all eternity.

1187
01:50:15,408 --> 01:50:21,142
Loyal forever, we raise our voices
in the words of mumbo gumbo:

1188
01:50:21,348 --> 01:50:23,009
Ya-Ya!

1189
01:50:27,087 --> 01:50:30,955
-Nice here on the porch, isnt it?
-Love it.

1190
01:50:44,537 --> 01:50:49,338
-I love you, Mama.
-I love you too, sunflower.
