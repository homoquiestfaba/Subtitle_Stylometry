The thing is today it
was you, but tomorrow

it's going to be one of us.

142
00:05:48,381 --> 00:05:49,882
I mean, it's all part of them
establishing the dominant role

She needs this
more than any of us.

You make it sound
like a party plan.

163
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:30,189
Well, who says it can't be?

164
00:06:30,289 --> 00:06:31,324
Partly.

165

Life's what you make it.

Yeah, well, that's
not why I'm going.

Oh.

00:06:34,694 --> 00:06:35,728
We know, Jill.

to mean exactly?

Forget it.

00:06:44,103 --> 00:06:45,271

what are you saying?

I don't know how to have fun?

Hey.

176
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:49,409
It means an afternoon on a beach
wouldn't kill any of us, OK?

177
00:06:49,509 --> 00:06:50,343
Give it a rest already.

00:06:53,212 --> 00:06:55,782
Maybe I should go alone.

181
00:06:55,882 --> 00:06:59,652
I know why Elizabeth thinks
everyone's watching her.

182
00:06:59,752 --> 00:07:01,988
Her ex is a doctor.

Some bigwig surgeon.

184
00:07:04,557 --> 00:07:06,459

talking about it.

00:07:12,565 --> 00:07:13,566
You've heard of him?

190
00:07:13,666 --> 00:07:14,467
Yes.

191
00:07:14,567 --> 00:07:17,136
Very, very big deal.

192
00:07:17,236 --> 00:07:19,105
No wonder she's so jumpy.

193
00:07:19,205 --> 00:07:20,506
[plane starting]

194
00:07:20,606 --> 00:07:21,908
RULON BEESLEY: All right.

195
00:07:22,008 --> 00:07:24,043
I'm going to try and get this
on Daniel's plane, and LiAnne,

196
00:07:24,143 --> 00:07:27,580
ask Graham if he packed those
larger boxes in my cargo.

197
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,582
OK, Ru.

198
00:07:29,682 --> 00:07:31,717
Uh, Daniel?

199
00:07:31,818 --> 00:07:33,486
No more working in the dark.

200
00:07:33,586 --> 00:07:34,420
Good.

201
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,122
You're going to
destroy your back.

202
00:07:43,396 --> 00:07:44,297
Look here.

203
00:07:48,601 --> 00:07:50,303
Len shaved off his beard.

204
00:07:50,403 --> 00:07:51,270
You be good.

205
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:52,538
You keep the home fires burning.

206
00:07:52,638 --> 00:07:54,240
[kiss] And everything
else as well.

207
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:56,008
And I'll put out the fire
when I get home, all right?

208
00:07:56,108 --> 00:07:59,979
[chuckle]

209
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:03,015
Hey!

210
00:08:03,115 --> 00:08:04,450
JILL HOUSTON: Now
Dennis, I want you to be

211
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:05,885
a big boy while I'm gone, OK?

212
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:07,320
You gonna help Grandma?

213
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:11,224
Be mommy's big boy.

214
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:14,260
Look who's here.

215
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:17,630
FRAN MARKOE: That's what
she calls an overnight bag?

216
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:18,898
Hello!

217
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:19,799
Hi.

218
00:08:19,899 --> 00:08:20,867
We weren't sure you were coming.

219
00:08:20,967 --> 00:08:22,301
I wasn't either.

220
00:08:22,401 --> 00:08:24,270
This is my daughter, Danae.

221
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:25,571
This is Rosie and Fran.

222
00:08:25,671 --> 00:08:26,506
Hi.

223
00:08:26,606 --> 00:08:27,707
I've heard a lot
about both of you.

224
00:08:27,807 --> 00:08:29,375
You have?

225
00:08:29,475 --> 00:08:30,409
Danae's coming with us.

226
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:31,844
She has 15 hours of
community service

227
00:08:31,944 --> 00:08:34,914
too, so I thought it'd be nice
if we could do it together.

228
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:37,283
Are you RN or LVN?

229
00:08:37,383 --> 00:08:38,885
Oh, actually,
I'm in med school.

230
00:08:38,985 --> 00:08:40,219
She's going to be a doctor.

231
00:08:40,319 --> 00:08:41,120
ROSIE ROMERO: Mm-hmm.

232
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:42,488
[giggle]

233
00:08:42,588 --> 00:08:44,223
Like father,
like daughter, huh?

234
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,329
What?

235
00:08:50,429 --> 00:08:52,331
DANIEL PERRIN: Where's Eddie?

236
00:08:52,431 --> 00:08:53,900
He'll be here.

237
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,069
You know his flair for
last minute entrances.

238
00:08:57,169 --> 00:08:58,104
Heads up.

239
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:03,109
RULON BEESLEY: Uh, Daniel?

240
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:07,113
I've got maybe 20
operations tomorrow.

241
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:09,782
They won't be any trouble.

242
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:11,350
Oh, no.

243
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:12,618
Student nurses.

244
00:09:12,718 --> 00:09:14,220
They're talking about us.

245
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,888
Of course they are.

246
00:09:15,988 --> 00:09:17,223
So what do you
think they're saying?

247
00:09:17,323 --> 00:09:18,124
Oh, no.

248
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:20,026
Student nurses.

249
00:09:20,126 --> 00:09:21,594
Keep it down, Sparky.

250
00:09:21,694 --> 00:09:23,229
You are awful, Mark!

251
00:09:23,329 --> 00:09:24,263
I know, honey.

252
00:09:24,363 --> 00:09:25,264
I know.

253
00:09:30,369 --> 00:09:32,104
Ladies, ladies, ladies.

254
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:36,776
Welcome.

255
00:09:36,876 --> 00:09:38,177
[plane taking off]

256
00:09:38,277 --> 00:09:39,812
LEN: Well, there they go.

257
00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:42,448
You know, we're losing
precious beach time here.

258
00:09:42,548 --> 00:09:43,349
Here he is.

259
00:09:43,449 --> 00:09:46,152
Eh, Mr. Punctual.

260
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:47,420
Eddie!

261
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:48,654
It's about time.

262
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:50,289
Me?

263
00:09:50,389 --> 00:09:51,457
This the nightcar to Paris?

264
00:09:51,557 --> 00:09:52,525
Yes.

265
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:53,793
We check the tires,
get the windshield,

266
00:09:53,893 --> 00:09:54,694
and we'll be on our way.

267
00:09:54,794 --> 00:09:59,498
[upbeat guitar music]

268
00:10:01,367 --> 00:10:03,669
JILL HOUSTON: So is it going to
take all day to get to Mexico?

269
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:06,639
DANIEL PERRIN: No, you'll have
time for a late afternoon swim

270
00:10:06,739 --> 00:10:09,008
or you can shop at Catamaco.

271
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:13,112
First thing in the morning,
we fly upriver to the clinic.

272
00:10:13,212 --> 00:10:14,246
LEN: Eddie, do you
want me to fly?

273
00:10:14,347 --> 00:10:15,448
Do you want me to take over?

274
00:10:15,548 --> 00:10:16,349
I've got it.

275
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:17,583
I've got it.

276
00:10:17,683 --> 00:10:19,418
You haven't let me take
over once since we started.

277
00:10:19,518 --> 00:10:20,553
Stop being a pest.

278
00:10:20,653 --> 00:10:22,121
LEN: I didn't know you
felt that way about me.

279
00:10:22,221 --> 00:10:23,122
EDDIE: All right.

280
00:10:46,045 --> 00:10:47,780
Oh, wow!

281
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:48,781
Look at that!

282
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:04,463
DANIEL PERRIN: OK, ladies.

283
00:11:04,563 --> 00:11:05,665
We have arrived.

284
00:11:05,765 --> 00:11:07,266
This is Catamaco.

285
00:11:21,947 --> 00:11:26,352
[laughter]

286
00:11:29,789 --> 00:11:31,057
No, you splashed me!

287
00:11:31,157 --> 00:11:34,860
[giggle] You can
say that again!

288
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,796
Oh, man!

289
00:11:36,896 --> 00:11:38,164
Who do we speak about
getting our classes

290
00:11:38,264 --> 00:11:39,065
scheduled right here.

291
00:11:39,165 --> 00:11:40,299
Here we go.

292
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:41,600
Ah, ladies.

293
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:42,501
Ladies!

294
00:11:42,601 --> 00:11:43,436
All right!

295
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:45,171
In our capacity
as full-fledged

296
00:11:45,271 --> 00:11:49,008
members of the airborne--

297
00:11:49,108 --> 00:11:51,377
airborne relief medicine
team, we would like

298
00:11:51,477 --> 00:11:53,079
to welcome you with this toast.

299
00:11:53,179 --> 00:11:54,680
Indeed.
- Here, here.

300
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:55,581
To Mexico!

301
00:11:55,681 --> 00:11:56,482
To Mexico!

302
00:11:56,582 --> 00:11:58,017
We play hard and we work hard!

303
00:11:58,117 --> 00:12:00,720
We don't get paid, but it's
perhaps the best work we do!

304
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:01,721
[giggles]
Salud!

305
00:12:01,821 --> 00:12:02,688
All right.
- Salud!

306
00:12:02,788 --> 00:12:03,589
Salud!

307
00:12:03,689 --> 00:12:04,757
Bottoms up.

308
00:12:04,857 --> 00:12:05,658
Turnover.

309
00:12:05,758 --> 00:12:09,662
[traffic]

310
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:23,142
OK, Elizabeth.

311
00:12:26,979 --> 00:12:29,281
Mexican government declared
war on the drug trade.

312
00:12:33,152 --> 00:12:34,553
And you think our
work is endless.

313
00:12:37,223 --> 00:12:40,593
That's the reason we can't
fly straight to the clinic.

314
00:12:40,693 --> 00:12:44,697
Anyone who flies after
dark gets shot down.

315
00:12:44,797 --> 00:12:46,932
It's my business here
regarding our whereabouts,

316
00:12:47,032 --> 00:12:49,401
and it pays to be prepared.

317
00:12:49,502 --> 00:12:50,870
I can still take
you to the beach.

318
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:51,904
Oh, no.
No.

319
00:12:52,004 --> 00:12:52,805
It's fine.

320
00:12:52,905 --> 00:12:53,939
I'm happy to help.

321
00:12:54,039 --> 00:12:54,840
Really?

322
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:55,741
You sure?

323
00:12:55,841 --> 00:12:57,910
Yes.

324
00:12:58,010 --> 00:12:58,811
OK, then.

325
00:12:58,911 --> 00:13:00,479
It's back to customs.

326
00:13:00,579 --> 00:13:01,480
Aeropuerto, por favor.

327
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:02,481
DRIVER: Sí, senor.

00:13:05,818 --> 00:13:10,156
[chatter]

329
00:13:13,559 --> 00:13:18,464
Life here sweeps you
along if you let it.

330
00:13:18,564 --> 00:13:21,333
Some people call it
chaos, but they're wrong.

331
00:13:21,433 --> 00:13:24,770
They just haven't
been here long enough.

332
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:25,671
[cattle mooing]

333
00:13:25,771 --> 00:13:26,839
Look at these people.

334
00:13:26,939 --> 00:13:30,576
They accept life as it is.

335
00:13:30,676 --> 00:13:33,512
They live the present
each and every day.

336
00:13:37,383 --> 00:13:40,419
They seem to find a peace
that's completely alien to us.

337
00:13:43,889 --> 00:13:47,226
Did I ever mention to you
that I know your husband?

338
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:48,694
No.

339
00:13:48,794 --> 00:13:51,497
My condolences on the divorce.

340
00:13:51,597 --> 00:13:54,033
Well, I'm not sure condolences
are the right sentiments,

341
00:13:54,133 --> 00:13:55,968
but thank you.

342
00:13:56,068 --> 00:13:58,704
You know, this used
to be a profession where

343
00:13:58,804 --> 00:14:01,407
a couple could age gracefully.

344
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:02,675
Yeah.

345
00:14:02,775 --> 00:14:06,278
I think I was born
a little too late.

00:14:19,024 --> 00:14:22,394
Well, what we got here?

350
00:14:22,494 --> 00:14:24,630
Oh!

351
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:26,765
I hate to tell you, but
I am all grown up now

352
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:28,567
and I bring my own
band-aids with me.

353
00:14:28,667 --> 00:14:32,538
This bag has saved your behind
more times than I can remember.

354
00:14:32,638 --> 00:14:35,574
So this is a permanent
move then, huh?

355
00:14:35,674 --> 00:14:36,709
I mean, you brought
enough clothes

356
00:14:36,809 --> 00:14:38,210
here to open up your own store.

357
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:40,112
I like choices.

358
00:14:40,212 --> 00:14:41,013
This.

359
00:14:41,113 --> 00:14:42,648
This is perfect.

360
00:14:42,748 --> 00:14:45,117
And this is exactly
how I always see you.

361
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:47,286
Roses and poetry and
beautiful clothes

362
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:50,356
and moonlit nights
and the Riviera.

363
00:14:50,456 --> 00:14:53,525
If that is a
compliment, I thank you.

364
00:14:57,997 --> 00:14:59,732
What is it that you're doing?

365
00:14:59,832 --> 00:15:02,001
I mean, you've never
worked a day in your life,

366
00:15:02,101 --> 00:15:04,803
and all of a sudden, you're
going out into the jungle

367
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:06,639
and you're going to be a nurse.

368
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:09,275
Haven't we mutilated and
buried this subject, Danae?

369
00:15:09,375 --> 00:15:11,944
DANAE HAHN: No, not as
far as I'm concerned.

370
00:15:12,044 --> 00:15:14,280
This is not like doing

Neither is-- is putting
myself through college.

375
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:23,555
Or leaving your father,
for that matter.

376
00:15:23,656 --> 00:15:26,058
Just because I lived one way
for 22 years doesn't mean

377
00:15:26,158 --> 00:15:27,893
I am not capable of
doing something else.

378
00:15:27,993 --> 00:15:29,028
DANAE HAHN: Well, I know.

379
00:15:29,128 --> 00:15:30,462
All I was saying is that
you might have no idea

380
00:15:30,562 --> 00:15:31,363
what you're getting into.

381
00:15:31,463 --> 00:15:32,298
What is the big deal?

382
00:15:32,398 --> 00:15:33,699
I'm doing the same
thing you are!

383
00:15:33,799 --> 00:15:35,100
- No, you're not!
- Why?

384
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,368
I'm going to be a doctor!

Bedpans and spoiled linens,
they're not going to be

387
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:42,574
I can't believe this.

388
00:15:42,675 --> 00:15:44,476
Danae, you have become a snob.

389
00:15:44,576 --> 00:15:45,744
Do you realize that?

390
00:15:45,844 --> 00:15:46,712
And you know what?

391
00:15:46,812 --> 00:15:50,382
They make the worst
kind of doctors.

[exhale] What do you
think your father

393
00:15:53,118 --> 00:15:54,253
and I used to talk about?

Probably.

397
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:01,694
We talked about medicine.

398
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:06,298
22 years, we talked
about medicine.

399
00:16:06,398 --> 00:16:11,503
[sigh] And yes, what I
am doing is different,

400
00:16:11,603 --> 00:16:16,075
and it scares the hell out of
me, but it feels right, Danae.

401
00:16:16,175 --> 00:16:19,311
And it's really been a
long time in coming for me.

402
00:16:19,411 --> 00:16:22,114
I guess what I'm trying to
say is that I don't want to see

403
00:16:22,214 --> 00:16:24,917
you make a fool of yourself.

404
00:16:25,017 --> 00:16:27,419

I'm embarrassing you.

I'm trying to say that--

407
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:32,157
Is this a discussion
you had with your father?

408
00:16:32,257 --> 00:16:33,826
DANAE HAHN: No, of course not.

409
00:16:33,926 --> 00:16:35,961
Mom, I'm sorry, all right?

410
00:16:36,061 --> 00:16:37,396

00:34:19,223 --> 00:34:20,391
All right.
Maybe we can get it back.

743
00:34:20,491 --> 00:34:21,492
Some of it, huh?

744
00:34:21,592 --> 00:34:23,361
People would pay
a lot for medicine.

745
00:34:23,461 --> 00:34:25,763
Even more than marijuana.

746
00:34:25,863 --> 00:34:27,465
They let their
own doctors die?

747
00:34:27,565 --> 00:34:29,667
What about the things
in the other two planes?

748
00:34:29,767 --> 00:34:31,436
All the medical supplies
were on Eddie's plane.

749
00:34:31,536 --> 00:34:35,339
You're saying we have
absolutely no medicine?

750
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:36,240
All right.

751
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:38,876
What do we do?

752
00:34:38,976 --> 00:34:41,079
We get them to the clinic.

753
00:34:41,179 --> 00:34:43,481
Call Catamaco, medivac
them out of here.

754
00:34:43,581 --> 00:34:45,650
A lot of time, a lot
of daylight left.

755
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:46,617
All right.

756
00:34:46,717 --> 00:34:49,520
Hey, Ru.

757
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:50,621
Keep an eye on Eddie.

758
00:34:50,721 --> 00:34:52,123
He's the one I'm
really worried about.

759
00:34:55,993 --> 00:34:56,794
All right.

760
00:34:56,894 --> 00:34:58,496
Edward?

761
00:34:58,596 --> 00:35:00,731
Edward, you got a couple
of broken ribs poking

762
00:35:00,832 --> 00:35:02,967
into your lung
here, so we're going

763
00:35:03,067 --> 00:35:07,004
to take my back brace
and wrap it around you

764
00:35:07,105 --> 00:35:09,841
and try and stabilize
those ribs, OK?

765
00:35:09,941 --> 00:35:12,610
Rosie, I need you to
stabilize him here,

766
00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:14,545
we'll go under his
shoulders and you

767
00:35:14,645 --> 00:35:15,847
get yourself on either side.

768
00:35:15,947 --> 00:35:16,981
We only got one
bag, and they're

769
00:35:17,081 --> 00:35:18,616
both losing a lot of blood.

770
00:35:18,716 --> 00:35:19,917
BP's 80 over 60.

771
00:35:20,017 --> 00:35:21,986
He's lost more blood
than I thought.

772
00:35:22,086 --> 00:35:25,056
I hope he doesn't go into shock.

773
00:35:25,156 --> 00:35:26,757
Maybe we could give
it to both of them.

774
00:35:26,858 --> 00:35:30,461
We could stabilize Len
and then give it to Ed.

775
00:35:30,561 --> 00:35:31,462
We trade them off.

776
00:35:34,499 --> 00:35:35,399
Do it.

777
00:35:38,569 --> 00:35:39,403
ELIZABETH HAHN: OK.

778
00:35:39,504 --> 00:35:40,505
Here we go.

779
00:35:40,605 --> 00:35:41,405
No.

780
00:35:41,506 --> 00:35:43,608
[cough] No, no.

781
00:35:43,708 --> 00:35:46,644
[coughing] Eddie first.

782
00:35:46,744 --> 00:35:47,545
No, no, no, no.

783
00:35:47,645 --> 00:35:49,147
Doctor's orders.

784
00:35:49,247 --> 00:35:50,148
What's my BP?

785
00:35:53,451 --> 00:35:55,853
I said, what's my
blood pressure?

786
00:35:55,953 --> 00:35:57,355
80 over 60.

787
00:35:57,455 --> 00:36:00,925
[groan] Oh, God.

788
00:36:01,025 --> 00:36:02,026
I'm dying.

789
00:36:02,126 --> 00:36:05,163
Hey, nobody's dying
here, least of all you.

790
00:36:05,263 --> 00:36:07,198
Besides, listen, if you die,
I'm pretty sure that program

791
00:36:07,298 --> 00:36:09,233
is not going to give us credit.

792
00:36:09,333 --> 00:36:15,072
You see me through this, and
I'll make sure that you pass.

793
00:36:15,173 --> 00:36:16,240
OK.

794
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:18,276
This might hurt a little, Doc.

795
00:36:18,376 --> 00:36:19,277
Ow!

796
00:36:19,377 --> 00:36:20,711
Joe, vamanos!

797
00:36:20,811 --> 00:36:21,712
OK.

798
00:36:30,121 --> 00:36:34,559
[ominous music]

799
00:36:43,501 --> 00:36:45,836
Cuantos hombres?

800
00:36:45,937 --> 00:36:46,737
Un hombre.

801
00:36:46,837 --> 00:36:48,606
Un hombre, tres senoritas.

802
00:36:54,212 --> 00:36:57,782
[speaking spanish]

803
00:37:07,058 --> 00:37:11,262
[speaking spanish]

804
00:37:11,362 --> 00:37:12,730
It's OK now.

805
00:37:12,830 --> 00:37:13,698
It's OK.

806
00:37:13,798 --> 00:37:18,402
[speaking spanish]

807
00:37:20,271 --> 00:37:21,172
Rapido.

808
00:37:23,774 --> 00:37:24,675
Gracias.

809
00:37:24,775 --> 00:37:25,676
OK.

810
00:37:25,776 --> 00:37:27,144
OK, OK.

811
00:37:27,245 --> 00:37:28,312
[speaking spanish]

812
00:37:28,412 --> 00:37:29,914
Oh, gracias.

813
00:37:30,014 --> 00:37:31,148
Where'd you learn Spanish?

814
00:37:31,249 --> 00:37:32,850
In the kitchen.

815
00:37:32,950 --> 00:37:36,354
I did learn a few things
as an affluent housewife.

816
00:37:36,454 --> 00:37:40,458
[groans]

817
00:37:48,199 --> 00:37:49,000
Ay!

818
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:50,134
Ah!

819
00:37:50,234 --> 00:37:52,837
Thought you said your
back was just tricky.

820
00:37:52,937 --> 00:37:55,373
Oh, I said that?

821
00:37:55,473 --> 00:37:56,607
I must have been lying.

822
00:37:56,707 --> 00:37:57,742
You must have.

823
00:37:57,842 --> 00:37:59,043
Don't let him fall asleep.

824
00:37:59,143 --> 00:38:00,845
ELIZABETH HAHN: OK.

825
00:38:00,945 --> 00:38:02,380
OK, I need some new splints.

826
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:03,281
Yeah, I'll do it.

827
00:38:03,381 --> 00:38:05,416
ELIZABETH HAHN: OK, thanks.

828
00:38:05,516 --> 00:38:06,417
I got this one.

829
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:12,290
DANIEL PERRIN:
[speaking spanish]

830
00:38:12,390 --> 00:38:13,524
First thing we've
got to do is reduce

831
00:38:13,624 --> 00:38:14,659
the swelling in Ed's leg.

832
00:38:14,759 --> 00:38:15,793
All right, I'll
take care of it.

833
00:38:15,893 --> 00:38:19,430
Listen, Daniel,
without my back brace,

834
00:38:19,530 --> 00:38:22,366
I'm going to be at a bit
of a disadvantage here.

835
00:38:22,466 --> 00:38:24,335
For one thing, I
can't stand up very

836
00:38:24,435 --> 00:38:26,304
long without going into spasm.

837
00:38:26,404 --> 00:38:28,506
I know it's horrible timing.

838
00:38:28,606 --> 00:38:31,609
I'm sorry, but I'll
give you the best I can.

839
00:38:31,709 --> 00:38:34,779
Meanwhile, you should call that
friend of yours in Catamaco

840
00:38:34,879 --> 00:38:36,247
and try to get us out of here.

841
00:38:36,347 --> 00:38:39,317
12 years, first time
I've had to call for help.

842
00:38:44,288 --> 00:38:45,656
All right.

843
00:38:45,756 --> 00:38:49,260
First step, we need to
reset this man's legs.

844
00:38:51,929 --> 00:38:53,197
And Edward, I don't
need to tell you

845
00:38:53,297 --> 00:38:55,232
this is going to hurt
like the dickens,

846
00:38:55,333 --> 00:38:57,034
but it's going to be
over in two minutes.

847
00:38:57,134 --> 00:39:00,905
[heavy breathing]

848
00:39:01,005 --> 00:39:01,906
All right.

849
00:39:02,006 --> 00:39:03,708
Elizabeth, you'll
do the resetting.

850
00:39:08,846 --> 00:39:11,615
Just listen to me, do exactly
what I say, and you'll be fine.

851
00:39:23,127 --> 00:39:27,498
EDDIE: [screaming]

852
00:39:28,599 --> 00:39:29,400
Almost.

853
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:30,301
Almost.

854
00:39:30,401 --> 00:39:31,402
We're almost there.

855
00:39:31,502 --> 00:39:32,703
Lean in a little more.

856
00:39:32,803 --> 00:39:35,373
EDDIE: [screaming]

857
00:39:35,473 --> 00:39:36,607
And a sharp one.

858
00:39:36,707 --> 00:39:37,575
[crack]

859
00:39:37,675 --> 00:39:38,476
[screaming]

860
00:39:38,576 --> 00:39:39,377
That's it!

861
00:39:39,477 --> 00:39:40,311
That's it!

862
00:39:40,411 --> 00:39:41,779
OK, maintain the tension.

863
00:39:41,879 --> 00:39:43,080
Wrap it up.

864
00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:44,548
Hang in there, Edward.

865
00:39:44,648 --> 00:39:46,150
Daniel's getting us
out of here soon.

866
00:39:46,250 --> 00:39:47,184
You're going to be all right.

867
00:39:47,284 --> 00:39:48,652
I need to lie down,
so I'm going to be

868
00:39:48,753 --> 00:39:50,688
in the next room on the floor.

869
00:39:50,788 --> 00:39:51,756
You'll be fine here.

870
00:39:51,856 --> 00:39:53,758
If you need me, you can call me.

871
00:39:56,594 --> 00:39:58,496
Well, what are we
supposed to do now?

872
00:39:58,596 --> 00:39:59,830
Keep them stable.

873
00:39:59,930 --> 00:40:00,931
With what?

874
00:40:01,031 --> 00:40:03,134
Whatever we have.

875
00:40:03,234 --> 00:40:06,170
Yeah, well, I got a problem.

876
00:40:06,270 --> 00:40:08,639
I just realized I'm
in the wrong class.

877
00:40:08,739 --> 00:40:11,342
We don't have a lot of
choice about that now.

878
00:40:11,442 --> 00:40:16,947
What we have, ladies, is a
job, whether we like it or not.

879
00:40:22,086 --> 00:40:23,654
DANIEL PERRIN: What I'm
telling you is that I have

880
00:40:23,754 --> 00:40:26,290
seriously injured people here.

881
00:40:26,390 --> 00:40:28,092
Right.

882
00:40:28,192 --> 00:40:32,463
You mean there's not one
plane in all of Catamaco?

883
00:40:32,563 --> 00:40:33,364
I'm sorry.

884
00:40:33,464 --> 00:40:34,331
Yes, I understand.

885
00:40:34,432 --> 00:40:35,232
I understand.

886
00:40:35,332 --> 00:40:37,568
Right.

887
00:40:37,668 --> 00:40:39,170
Please!
Please, yes.

888
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:40,104
That's a good idea.

889
00:40:40,204 --> 00:40:41,071
Thank you very much.

890
00:40:41,172 --> 00:40:42,072
Thank you.

891
00:40:47,411 --> 00:40:48,779
WOMAN (ON PHONE):
[speaking spanish]

892
00:40:48,879 --> 00:40:55,052
Hello, I'd like the number-
por favor, yo quiero hablar

893
00:40:55,152 --> 00:40:57,655
con la policia in Catamaco.

894
00:40:57,755 --> 00:41:00,591
[gasp] My purse.

895
00:41:04,995 --> 00:41:05,796
LiAnne?

896
00:41:05,896 --> 00:41:06,797
You all right?

897
00:41:06,897 --> 00:41:08,766
Li-- ah!

898
00:41:08,866 --> 00:41:11,335
Oh!

899
00:41:11,435 --> 00:41:12,503
LiAnne?

900
00:41:12,603 --> 00:41:15,005
Where are you going?

901
00:41:15,105 --> 00:41:18,108
I lost my purse.

902
00:41:18,209 --> 00:41:19,343
Um, OK, uh--

903
00:41:19,443 --> 00:41:20,411
I know where it is.

904
00:41:20,511 --> 00:41:21,545
I'm going to get it
for you, all right?

905
00:41:21,645 --> 00:41:22,813
I want you to come
in and lie down.

906
00:41:22,913 --> 00:41:24,281
I need my lipstick.

907
00:41:24,381 --> 00:41:25,716
OK, I understand.

908
00:41:25,816 --> 00:41:27,618
I'll get it for you, OK?

909
00:41:27,718 --> 00:41:30,287
Oh, God!

910
00:41:30,387 --> 00:41:31,889
What is it?

911
00:41:31,989 --> 00:41:32,890
I'm bleeding.

912
00:41:39,029 --> 00:41:40,364
Graham's bleeding.
What do I do?

913
00:41:40,464 --> 00:41:41,165
Shh, shh, shh, shh.
Come on.

914
00:41:41,265 --> 00:41:42,533
Calm down.
Calm down.

915
00:41:42,633 --> 00:41:43,534
It's OK.
Let's go see.

916
00:41:43,634 --> 00:41:44,535
Come on.

917
00:41:51,509 --> 00:41:55,012
Well, I think it stopped.

918
00:41:55,112 --> 00:41:56,480
GRAHAM: [groan]

919
00:41:56,580 --> 00:41:57,448
Feel better?
GRAHAM: Yeah.

920
00:41:57,548 --> 00:41:58,449
Thank you.

921
00:42:17,067 --> 00:42:21,505
JILL HOUSTON: [sigh]

922
00:42:24,942 --> 00:42:28,712
Here I thought Fran
was the screw up.

923
00:42:28,812 --> 00:42:30,881
And I'm dragging
Eddie on the ground.

924
00:42:33,517 --> 00:42:35,085
Jill, I don't care
what he said to you.

925
00:42:35,185 --> 00:42:38,222
You had to move him and you did.

926
00:42:38,322 --> 00:42:41,058
You're doing fine.

927
00:42:41,158 --> 00:42:46,397
I have a job at the VA
IN the psychiatric unit.

928
00:42:46,497 --> 00:42:54,104
I have been spit on,
punched, bitten, tackled.

929
00:42:54,204 --> 00:42:57,775
I thought a job like that,
I could handle anything.

930
00:42:57,875 --> 00:43:01,512
[scoff] Well, I'm not sure
any of us were ready for this.

931
00:43:01,612 --> 00:43:03,247
I wanted to impress him.

932
00:43:05,783 --> 00:43:09,987
Dr. Perrin is the
only reason I am here.

933
00:43:10,087 --> 00:43:15,159
I could get community service
credit anywhere, but I mean,

934
00:43:15,259 --> 00:43:23,500
being here, doing
this, working with him,

935
00:43:23,601 --> 00:43:25,703
it's an opportunity of a
lifetime and I blew it.

936
00:43:31,742 --> 00:43:33,877
What did you do with the VA?

937
00:43:33,978 --> 00:43:35,980
Nothing special.

938
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:37,247
Mostly, I just talk to them.

939
00:43:40,818 --> 00:43:41,919
You feel like talking now?

940
00:43:51,228 --> 00:43:54,832
Hey, gorgeous.

941
00:43:54,932 --> 00:43:56,900
You want to dance?

942
00:43:57,001 --> 00:44:00,337
[coughing]

943
00:44:00,437 --> 00:44:05,309
Um, do you have--
do you have any kids?

944
00:44:05,409 --> 00:44:06,210
Two.

945
00:44:06,310 --> 00:44:07,211
Two.

946
00:44:09,213 --> 00:44:10,347
I have one little boy.

947
00:44:10,447 --> 00:44:11,248
Yeah?

948
00:44:11,348 --> 00:44:12,182
Yeah.

949
00:44:12,282 --> 00:44:13,250
How old?

950
00:44:13,350 --> 00:44:14,251
Three.

951
00:44:20,224 --> 00:44:24,962
I have been on the phone with
every official in Catamaco.

952
00:44:25,062 --> 00:44:26,430
No one has a big enough plane.

953
00:44:30,501 --> 00:44:32,336
Are you sure we shouldn't
just rip out the seats

954
00:44:32,436 --> 00:44:33,837
in our own planes and make do?

955
00:44:33,937 --> 00:44:35,439
There still wouldn't
be enough room.

956
00:44:35,539 --> 00:44:37,007
We need recumbent transport.

957
00:44:37,107 --> 00:44:40,644
If we sit them up, how do we
sustain their blood pressure?

958
00:44:40,744 --> 00:44:41,545
We can't.

959
00:44:41,645 --> 00:44:44,014
We'll kill them.

960
00:44:44,114 --> 00:44:45,716
Right.

961
00:44:45,816 --> 00:44:46,717
They've got to be flat.

962
00:44:49,420 --> 00:44:50,654
Well, I'm going
to check on Graham.

963
00:44:53,323 --> 00:44:55,559
DANIEL PERRIN: Maybe we could
try San Diego Air Rescue.

964
00:44:58,896 --> 00:45:03,300
[ominous music]

965
00:45:04,268 --> 00:45:06,704
We'll be losing the light soon.

966
00:45:06,804 --> 00:45:08,105
There's got to be something.

967
00:45:11,108 --> 00:45:14,144
My husband used to say there's
always some little thing

968
00:45:14,244 --> 00:45:16,380
you can do for a patient.

969
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:17,815
DANIEL PERRIN: Was he
in the Mexican jungle

970
00:45:17,915 --> 00:45:18,716
when he said that?

971
00:45:18,816 --> 00:45:19,850
We can't dial 911.
- I know.

972
00:45:19,950 --> 00:45:20,851
I know.

973
00:45:25,923 --> 00:45:29,059
You're the only hope
they have, Daniel.

974
00:45:29,159 --> 00:45:30,494
So how do we get them out?

975
00:45:33,764 --> 00:45:34,998
At this rate, we don't.

976
00:45:40,604 --> 00:45:41,438
[troubled jungle music]

977
00:45:41,538 --> 00:45:43,607
Senores y senoras, por favor.

978
00:45:43,707 --> 00:45:45,409
Escuchame.

979
00:45:45,509 --> 00:45:48,746
Lo siento, mucho.

980
00:45:48,846 --> 00:45:52,649
Por que hoy, no clinic.

981
00:45:52,750 --> 00:45:55,252
No-- no-- no tenemos la clinica.

982
00:45:55,352 --> 00:45:59,523
[murmuring]

983
00:46:01,325 --> 00:46:02,559
They understood what
I said, did they?

984
00:46:02,659 --> 00:46:06,029
Yes, they understand.

985
00:46:06,130 --> 00:46:07,698
We stay, por favor.

986
00:46:11,869 --> 00:46:14,004
You can stay, but--

987
00:46:14,104 --> 00:46:17,708
pero no tenemos medicina.

988
00:46:17,808 --> 00:46:19,510
Podemos hacer nada.

989
00:46:19,610 --> 00:46:21,245
We can do nothing.

990
00:46:21,345 --> 00:46:24,314
[speaking spanish]

991
00:46:32,022 --> 00:46:32,823
What did she say?

992
00:46:32,923 --> 00:46:34,258
I didn't get all of that.

993
00:46:34,358 --> 00:46:38,629
She said, God brought
the doctors to help us.

994
00:46:38,729 --> 00:46:42,232
Now, they will stay
so God will come

995
00:46:42,332 --> 00:46:46,703
again and help the doctors.

996
00:46:46,804 --> 00:46:48,338
They're right.

997
00:46:48,438 --> 00:46:49,640
It's in God's hands now.

998
00:46:51,742 --> 00:46:52,643
Gracias.

999
00:46:55,913 --> 00:46:56,880
LOIS: What?

1000
00:46:56,980 --> 00:46:58,048
They can't get air
transport into Mexico?

1001
00:46:58,148 --> 00:46:59,116
No, apparently not.

1002
00:46:59,216 --> 00:47:00,651
I'm arranging clearance
for us right now.

1003
00:47:00,751 --> 00:47:02,152
They crashed--
they crashed right

1004
00:47:02,252 --> 00:47:04,354
here in the Sinaloa jungle.

1005
00:47:04,454 --> 00:47:05,255
I've never heard of it.

1006
00:47:05,355 --> 00:47:06,523
We'll know soon enough.

1007
00:47:06,623 --> 00:47:08,625
They got four critical
injuries, all stretcher cases.

1008
00:47:08,725 --> 00:47:10,394
So we're going to
need four planes.

1009
00:47:10,494 --> 00:47:12,296
LOIS: We only have three
planes flight ready.

1010
00:47:12,396 --> 00:47:13,430
Great.
OK.

1011
00:47:13,530 --> 00:47:15,098
Chris will take the jet,
bring out the first one,

1012
00:47:15,199 --> 00:47:16,466
then go back for the last one.

1013
00:47:16,567 --> 00:47:18,869
You and Pete and the Cessnas
will take out numbers 2 and 3.

1014
00:47:18,969 --> 00:47:20,504
Mexico it is.

1015
00:47:20,604 --> 00:47:21,872
You got a problem.

1016
00:47:21,972 --> 00:47:23,540
Doc Wilson is in surgery.

1017
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:26,510
They say he won't be free
for another two hours.

1018
00:47:26,610 --> 00:47:27,878
What about Reed?

1019
00:47:27,978 --> 00:47:29,046
Halfway up Mount Shasta.

1020
00:47:29,146 --> 00:47:30,414
Some climbers ran into trouble.

1021
00:47:30,514 --> 00:47:31,381
And Wiley is on vacation.

1022
00:47:31,481 --> 00:47:32,549
Yeah.
Damn.

1023
00:47:32,649 --> 00:47:33,851
OK, call St. Catherine.

1024
00:47:33,951 --> 00:47:35,853
See if they have someone on
call that they can spare?

1025
00:47:35,953 --> 00:47:36,854
OK.

1026
00:47:36,954 --> 00:47:39,289
[phone ringing]

1027
00:47:39,389 --> 00:47:40,324
Air Rescue?

1028
00:47:42,826 --> 00:47:44,595
I want that confirmed.

1029
00:47:44,695 --> 00:47:46,563
Yes, now.

1030
00:47:46,663 --> 00:47:49,366
Mexican authorities won't
issue us a clearance.

1031
00:47:49,466 --> 00:47:50,467
You're kidding.

1032
00:47:50,567 --> 00:47:52,736
No flights permitted
over Sinaloa after 5:00.

1033
00:47:52,836 --> 00:47:53,770
There's no exception.

1034
00:47:53,871 --> 00:47:56,206
There's some drug
interdiction thing.

1035
00:47:56,306 --> 00:48:01,245
OK, that's four hours
flying time in the Cessna's?

1036
00:48:01,345 --> 00:48:02,246
Grounded.

1037
00:48:08,952 --> 00:48:10,888
LiAnne's right
pupil is dilated

1038
00:48:10,988 --> 00:48:14,825
and she's very disoriented.

1039
00:48:14,925 --> 00:48:16,927
Are you sure?

1040
00:48:17,027 --> 00:48:19,296
Well, she just told me
she was late for the opera.

1041
00:48:19,396 --> 00:48:21,265
I think there are
significant indications

1042
00:48:21,365 --> 00:48:23,033
of intracranial swelling
due to bleeding.

1043
00:48:26,637 --> 00:48:29,006
Leave the diagnosing to
us, Elizabeth, all right?

1044
00:48:33,510 --> 00:48:35,279
I'll take a look at it--

1045
00:48:35,379 --> 00:48:36,313
I can manage myself.

1046
00:48:40,050 --> 00:48:42,386
[groan]

1047
00:48:42,486 --> 00:48:44,421
OK, look this way.

1048
00:48:44,521 --> 00:48:45,322
All right.

1049
00:48:45,422 --> 00:48:47,424
Once again, this way.

1050
00:48:47,524 --> 00:48:48,358
Good.

1051
00:48:48,458 --> 00:48:49,426
OK.

1052
00:48:49,526 --> 00:48:52,596
I'm going to check
back here for swelling.

1053
00:48:52,696 --> 00:48:53,563
OK?

1054
00:48:53,664 --> 00:48:54,464
Yeah.

1055
00:48:54,564 --> 00:48:56,166
Yeah.

1056
00:48:56,266 --> 00:48:57,668
OK.
All right, LiAnne.

1057
00:48:57,768 --> 00:48:58,669
Thank you.

1058
00:49:03,006 --> 00:49:07,311
Well, not a bad
diagnosis, I'd say.

1059
00:49:07,411 --> 00:49:11,214
Unfortunately, the bleeding is
causing pressure on her brain

1060
00:49:11,315 --> 00:49:12,849
and we have to
remove that pressure.

1061
00:49:12,950 --> 00:49:14,451
How?

1062
00:49:14,551 --> 00:49:17,187
Keep her still,
keep her head elevated

1063
00:49:17,287 --> 00:49:19,423
no more than 30 degrees.

1064
00:49:19,523 --> 00:49:22,492
Minimum fluids.

1065
00:49:22,592 --> 00:49:25,062
I want to dehydrate her
as much as possible.

1066
00:49:25,162 --> 00:49:27,998
Dry as we can keep her.

1067
00:49:28,098 --> 00:49:31,268
I'd put her on
Lasix if we had any.

1068
00:49:31,368 --> 00:49:34,171
I actually might have a
couple of diuretic pills.

1069
00:49:34,271 --> 00:49:36,840
In your bag?

1070
00:49:36,940 --> 00:49:39,977
You should acquire a
patent on that bag.

1071
00:49:40,077 --> 00:49:40,877
FRAN MARKOE: Doctor?

1072
00:49:40,978 --> 00:49:42,479
What now?

1073
00:49:42,579 --> 00:49:43,814
Len's having
trouble breathing.

1074
00:49:43,914 --> 00:49:44,815
OK.

1075
00:49:48,452 --> 00:49:50,687
DANIEL PERRIN: What do you
mean they won't let you fly?

1076
00:49:50,787 --> 00:49:52,489
You're an air rescue
team, aren't you?

1077
00:49:52,589 --> 00:49:53,824
Yes, sir.

1078
00:49:53,924 --> 00:49:56,159
Here in Southern California,
that's exactly what we are.

1079
00:49:56,259 --> 00:49:58,929
But you're in Mexico, and
Mexican authorities do not want

1080
00:49:59,029 --> 00:50:00,697
us flying in there after dark.

1081
00:50:00,797 --> 00:50:03,166
Now, we're still working on it.

1082
00:50:03,266 --> 00:50:06,036
I'm afraid you and your people
may have to last out the night.

1083
00:50:06,136 --> 00:50:08,638
Sir, I will have
casualties here if we are

1084
00:50:08,739 --> 00:50:10,073
forced to wait for daybreak.

1085
00:50:10,173 --> 00:50:11,641
I want to make that
perfectly clear.

1086
00:50:15,846 --> 00:50:17,347
I understand.

1087
00:50:17,447 --> 00:50:18,348
[slams phone]

1088
00:50:18,448 --> 00:50:19,516
Not now, Elizabeth!
- No, I know.

1089
00:50:19,616 --> 00:50:20,417
I'm sorry.

1090
00:50:20,517 --> 00:50:21,418
It's Len.

1091
00:50:25,455 --> 00:50:27,958
His lungs are
filling with fluid.

1092
00:50:28,058 --> 00:50:29,359
He's going into shock.

1093
00:50:29,459 --> 00:50:34,131
He needs oxygen and blood, and
I don't have oxygen and blood!

1094
00:50:34,231 --> 00:50:36,633
There's not one
thing that I can do.

1095
00:50:36,733 --> 00:50:38,435
I am not a miracle worker!

1096
00:50:43,273 --> 00:50:45,208
The only thing we can offer
them now is compassion,

1097
00:50:45,308 --> 00:50:51,048
and you're probably a hell of
a lot better at that than I am.

1098
00:50:51,148 --> 00:50:55,419
So why don't you do what you can
and I'll sit here by the phone,

1099
00:50:55,519 --> 00:50:56,420
do what I can.

1100
00:50:59,056 --> 00:51:01,091
I hope you understand.

1101
00:51:01,191 --> 00:51:02,092

Just a little water.

00:52:09,726 --> 00:52:15,332
You know, I used to be afraid
of just about everything?

1106
00:52:15,432 --> 00:52:17,300
I think that's why I try
so hard to be perfect.

You are perfect.

00:52:29,112 --> 00:52:32,282
Well, not according to my ex.

1111
00:52:32,382 --> 00:52:37,087
Well, honey, he just
wasn't good enough for you.

1112
00:52:39,990 --> 00:52:41,158
Yeah.

1113
00:52:41,258 --> 00:52:43,093
Sometimes I wonder how
something as wonderful as my son

1114
00:52:43,193 --> 00:52:44,995
could come out something
as wrong as my marriage.

This man found
this in the jungle.

00:53:05,048 --> 00:53:06,483
He says an angel
spoke to him and told

1120
00:53:06,583 --> 00:53:09,419
him it would cure the sick
doctors, so he brought it here.

1121
00:53:16,726 --> 00:53:19,462
Atropine.

1122
00:53:19,563 --> 00:53:20,363
Thank you.

1123
00:53:20,463 --> 00:53:22,999
Make sure you thank him.

Muchas gracias, senor!

1125
00:53:24,568 --> 00:53:26,937
De nada, senorita.

1126
00:53:27,037 --> 00:53:28,471
Atropine could just
as easily kill him, Dan.

1127
00:53:28,572 --> 00:53:29,372
Come on, Ru.

1128
00:53:29,472 --> 00:53:30,373
He's going into shock.

1129
00:53:30,473 --> 00:53:31,708
He's drowning in his own fluid.

If his heart can't take the
atropine, he'll die anyway!

00:55:42,072 --> 00:55:44,174
Just let him go.

Well, my father was from Oaxaca.

00:57:17,634 --> 00:57:18,968
He's a car dealer now.

1195
00:57:19,068 --> 00:57:22,705
And my mother was
born in America.

1196
00:57:22,806 --> 00:57:24,507
I want to show you something.

1197
00:57:38,254 --> 00:57:40,256
People who leave their
homes and headed North.

ROSIE ROMERO: All these
people were from here?

1199
00:57:45,862 --> 00:57:48,932
Here, from the South,
from the mountains.

1200
00:57:49,032 --> 00:57:53,036
All went through this
town headed to El Norte.

1201
00:57:53,136 --> 00:57:56,973
Even if they didn't survive the
trip, they knew there was this.

1202
00:58:00,477 --> 00:58:02,212
My father never talks
about his childhood

in Mexico or Mother.

1204
00:58:06,850 --> 00:58:09,752

about hardship to his daughter?

00:58:35,879 --> 00:58:38,615
Never leave home without it.

1211
00:58:38,715 --> 00:58:41,317
Actually, that
was meant to be an--

1212
00:58:41,417 --> 00:58:44,854
that was your daughter's
attempt at an apology.

1213
00:58:44,954 --> 00:58:46,289
I don't know.

1214
00:58:46,389 --> 00:58:48,024
Sometimes I think
one thing in my mouth

1215
00:58:48,124 --> 00:58:49,993

1216
00:58:50,093 --> 00:58:50,894
like last night.

1217
00:58:50,994 --> 00:58:53,363
I mean, it's a perfect example.

1218
00:58:53,463 --> 00:58:56,499
I didn't mean to imply
that you couldn't do this.

1219
00:58:56,599 --> 00:58:59,469
But that's how it came out.

1220
00:58:59,569 --> 00:59:02,605
And I hear myself saying it
when I say it, but I just--

1221
00:59:02,705 --> 00:59:03,506
I don't know.

1222
00:59:03,606 --> 00:59:04,941
It's like, it's a problem.

1223
00:59:05,041 --> 00:59:07,610
And maybe it's just my
neurons or something

1224
00:59:07,710 --> 00:59:10,146
just don't synapse properly.

1225
00:59:10,246 --> 00:59:12,782
You get that from your father.

1226
00:59:12,882 --> 00:59:13,683
Why not?

1227
00:59:13,783 --> 00:59:14,717
I got everything else.

1228
00:59:14,817 --> 00:59:15,618
Not everything.

you this this morning.

I kind of wished that dad was
here, and then I felt bad--

00:59:30,567 --> 00:59:31,367
Don't.

1235
00:59:31,467 --> 00:59:33,036
I felt the same way.

00:59:33,136 --> 00:59:34,103
You did?

Honey, your father's
a hell of a doctor.

I got a problem with.

Yeah.

Well, I don't feel
like that now.

My advisor told me, just
before we came down here,

1250

they're thinking about
washing me out of the program.

I'm not nurse-like
enough or something.

It's been a problem all my life.

them wrong, though, huh?

my mom kept bugging me.

01:03:41,984 --> 01:03:43,853
LiAnne!

1282
01:03:43,953 --> 01:03:46,455
[animal noises]

1283
01:04:06,709 --> 01:04:09,111
LiAnne?

1284
01:04:09,212 --> 01:04:10,613
It's beautiful, isn't it?

1285
01:04:14,517 --> 01:04:15,985
Do I know you?

1286
01:04:18,921 --> 01:04:20,389
LiAnne, it's Jill.

1287
01:04:23,025 --> 01:04:28,130
[giggle] I'm thirsty.

1288
01:04:28,231 --> 01:04:29,398
I-- I know.

1289
01:04:29,498 --> 01:04:30,299
I know.

1290
01:04:30,399 --> 01:04:31,934
You had a head.

1291
01:04:32,034 --> 01:04:32,902
Do you remember?

1292
01:04:33,002 --> 01:04:33,903
You can't drink.

1293
01:04:34,003 --> 01:04:34,904
Remember?

1294
01:04:37,473 --> 01:04:39,342
I don't know what
I'm doing here.

1295
01:04:39,442 --> 01:04:40,810
[crying]

1296
01:04:40,910 --> 01:04:42,311
Oh.

1297
01:04:42,411 --> 01:04:43,880
It's OK.

1298
01:04:43,980 --> 01:04:44,780
OK.

1299
01:04:44,881 --> 01:04:45,748
Oh.

1300
01:04:45,848 --> 01:04:47,717
Oh.

1301
01:04:47,817 --> 01:04:50,686
It's OK.

1302
01:04:50,786 --> 01:04:51,787
Here we go.

1303
01:04:56,993 --> 01:04:58,661
DANIEL PERRIN: You leave
the Mexican clearance to me.

1304
01:04:58,761 --> 01:05:01,130
I'll fly to Catamaco and
talk to them in person.

1305
01:05:01,230 --> 01:05:02,832
Just get the planes down here.

1306
01:05:02,932 --> 01:05:04,133
Doctor, it's not that simple.

1307
01:05:04,233 --> 01:05:06,402
Even if you could get
clearance, I just found out

1308
01:05:06,502 --> 01:05:08,404
that we can't land in Montepio.

1309
01:05:08,504 --> 01:05:09,906
What do you mean
you can't land here?

1310
01:05:10,006 --> 01:05:11,407
You've landed here for years.

1311
01:05:11,507 --> 01:05:13,476
PILOT (ON PHONE): Not
in the jet, you haven't.

1312
01:05:13,576 --> 01:05:16,279
Look, we need at least 5,000
feet of runway for the jet,

1313
01:05:16,379 --> 01:05:19,215
and as far as I can make
out, you barely have 2,000.

1314
01:05:19,315 --> 01:05:20,516
Well, what about the Cessnas?

1315
01:05:20,616 --> 01:05:21,884
PILOT (ON PHONE):
Doctor, that would mean

1316
01:05:21,984 --> 01:05:23,452
a night landing in Montepio.

1317
01:05:23,552 --> 01:05:25,288
Now, if my people knew
the field, I'd chance it.

1318
01:05:25,388 --> 01:05:26,188
Yeah.

1319
01:05:26,289 --> 01:05:27,523
But no.

1320
01:05:27,623 --> 01:05:28,591
So now what?

1321
01:05:28,691 --> 01:05:30,693
So you need to
find me a runway.

1322
01:05:34,030 --> 01:05:34,931
I'll get back to you.

1323
01:05:37,767 --> 01:05:39,335
Oh, wonderful.

1324
01:05:39,435 --> 01:05:40,736
ELIZABETH HAHN: It's OK.

1325
01:05:40,836 --> 01:05:42,772
It's OK.

1326
01:05:42,872 --> 01:05:44,440
It's OK, honey.
Come on.

1327
01:05:44,540 --> 01:05:45,341
Sit down.

1328
01:05:45,441 --> 01:05:46,242
Yeah.

1329
01:05:46,342 --> 01:05:47,143
Look at me.

1330
01:05:47,243 --> 01:05:49,845
Look right at my face.

1331
01:05:49,946 --> 01:05:52,048
The important thing
is we got her back.

1332
01:05:52,148 --> 01:05:52,949
Honey?

1333
01:05:53,049 --> 01:05:53,950
LiAnne?

1334
01:05:57,653 --> 01:05:58,454
Graham?

1335
01:05:58,554 --> 01:05:59,989
Oh, good!

1336
01:06:00,022 --> 01:06:01,757
She recognizes you.

1337
01:06:01,857 --> 01:06:03,059
Graham, you think
you can hold her?

1338
01:06:03,159 --> 01:06:04,860
Maybe we can keep
her still that way.

1339
01:06:04,961 --> 01:06:06,362
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

1340
01:06:06,462 --> 01:06:07,330
Good.

1341
01:06:07,430 --> 01:06:08,798
Come on.
[soft music]

1342
01:06:08,898 --> 01:06:09,699
Come on.

1343
01:06:09,799 --> 01:06:12,268
You go right over here.

1344
01:06:12,368 --> 01:06:13,469
Here you go.

1345
01:06:13,569 --> 01:06:14,370
Come on.

1346
01:06:14,470 --> 01:06:15,271
Lay down.

1347
01:06:15,371 --> 01:06:16,939
Down you go.

1348
01:06:17,039 --> 01:06:19,308
That's it, sweetheart.

1349
01:06:19,408 --> 01:06:20,843
That's it.

1350
01:06:20,943 --> 01:06:21,777
OK?

1351
01:06:21,877 --> 01:06:23,713
Everything's going
to be all right.

1352
01:06:23,813 --> 01:06:26,682
[shaky breathing]

1353
01:06:26,782 --> 01:06:28,317
Everything's going
to be all right.

1354
01:06:32,321 --> 01:06:33,589
El Fuerte.

1355
01:06:33,689 --> 01:06:35,057
Never heard of it.

1356
01:06:35,157 --> 01:06:37,793
They have a
runway long enough.

1357
01:06:37,893 --> 01:06:40,162
I have seen jets land there.

1358
01:06:40,262 --> 01:06:42,298
How long does it
take to get there?

1359
01:06:42,398 --> 01:06:43,265
JOSE: Two hours.

1360
01:06:43,366 --> 01:06:44,166
Two hours.

1361
01:06:44,266 --> 01:06:45,968
If the road is clear.

1362
01:06:46,068 --> 01:06:47,937
Two hours through the jungle.

1363
01:06:48,037 --> 01:06:51,173
And the mountains.

1364
01:06:51,273 --> 01:06:54,343
Edward and Len barely
survived the first ride.

1365
01:06:54,443 --> 01:06:55,544
I know that, Ru.

1366
01:06:59,181 --> 01:07:00,049
3:30.

1367
01:07:00,149 --> 01:07:02,985
Got three hours of light left.

1368
01:07:03,085 --> 01:07:04,987
What if the road is as bad
as I think it's going to be?

1369
01:07:05,087 --> 01:07:08,591
If we get a flat tire--

1370
01:07:08,691 --> 01:07:10,860
Ru, what are the odds?

1371
01:07:10,960 --> 01:07:11,794
Not good.

1372
01:07:11,894 --> 01:07:12,695
Come on, Ru!

1373
01:07:12,795 --> 01:07:14,697
I need an opinion.

1374
01:07:14,797 --> 01:07:15,598
All right.

1375
01:07:15,698 --> 01:07:16,932
Leonard is in shock.

1376
01:07:17,033 --> 01:07:17,867
He's critical.

1377
01:07:17,967 --> 01:07:19,969
We move him, I
think we lose him.

1378
01:07:20,069 --> 01:07:23,139
Edward-- Edward is
stable for the moment.

1379
01:07:23,239 --> 01:07:24,340
We've got his BP up.

1380
01:07:24,440 --> 01:07:26,375
But Graham?

1381
01:07:26,475 --> 01:07:27,376
I don't know.

1382
01:07:27,476 --> 01:07:29,011
Fractured pelvis
loses a lot of blood.

1383
01:07:29,111 --> 01:07:30,012
Maybe a torn urethra.

1384
01:07:30,112 --> 01:07:31,680
I'm surprised he's
not in shock too.

1385
01:07:31,781 --> 01:07:33,482
LiAnne, no way.

1386
01:07:33,582 --> 01:07:36,252
There's major intracranial
bleeding there.

1387
01:07:36,352 --> 01:07:38,921
I wouldn't like her chances
if there was a trauma

1388
01:07:39,021 --> 01:07:42,591
center waiting in El Fuerte.

1389
01:07:42,691 --> 01:07:43,926
What are you saying?

1390
01:07:44,026 --> 01:07:45,594
That we shouldn't try El Fuerte?

1391
01:07:45,694 --> 01:07:48,464
I'm saying you move
Leonard and LiAnne,

1392
01:07:48,564 --> 01:07:50,399
we may well lose them.

1393
01:07:50,499 --> 01:07:51,834
You want me to make a decision?

1394
01:07:51,934 --> 01:07:56,739
I say-- [sigh]

1395
01:08:02,578 --> 01:08:04,780
Whatever gets them
medical attention first!

1396
01:08:10,920 --> 01:08:14,657
Daniel, look!

1397
01:08:14,757 --> 01:08:15,758
We're only doctors.

1398
01:08:20,396 --> 01:08:23,799
PILOT: So this El Fuerte
seems long enough.

1399
01:08:23,899 --> 01:08:27,670
I think we can make it
before dark, or close to it.

1400
01:08:27,770 --> 01:08:29,738
So should we do it?

1401
01:08:32,541 --> 01:08:35,077
I haven't decided yet.

1402
01:08:35,177 --> 01:08:39,582
[soft music]

1403
01:08:48,891 --> 01:08:51,026
Well, I'd say life
certainly has swept us along.

1404
01:08:54,864 --> 01:08:58,534
This bougainvillea is
supposed to grow like a weed.

1405
01:08:58,634 --> 01:09:00,102
Maybe it's trying to
tell me something.

1406
01:09:04,206 --> 01:09:05,875
Wife and I were on
vacation in this part

1407
01:09:05,975 --> 01:09:07,977
of Mexico 14 years
ago, and we decided

1408
01:09:08,077 --> 01:09:11,347
to create a clinic here.

1409
01:09:11,447 --> 01:09:16,252
It was closer than
Africa and less hostile

1410
01:09:16,352 --> 01:09:17,586
than Central America.

1411
01:09:21,157 --> 01:09:24,994
She would come down with me all
the time until it became too

1412
01:09:25,094 --> 01:09:26,028
difficult for her to travel.

1413
01:09:30,599 --> 01:09:31,934
We worked together side by side.

1414
01:09:32,034 --> 01:09:35,738
We were a really good team.

1415
01:09:35,838 --> 01:09:38,107
I miss her.

1416
01:09:38,207 --> 01:09:41,544
Walt preferred Europe.

1417
01:09:41,644 --> 01:09:45,948
[chuckle] I didn't know
your husband very well.

1418
01:09:46,048 --> 01:09:46,949
I didn't either.

1419
01:09:54,757 --> 01:09:57,126
Well, I'm getting to know you.

1420
01:09:57,226 --> 01:09:59,795
And I got to tell you,
I'm really impressed.

1421
01:10:02,665 --> 01:10:04,700
Thank you.

1422
01:10:04,800 --> 01:10:07,169
Coming from someone like
you, it means a lot to me.

1423
01:10:10,539 --> 01:10:18,280
This trip to El Fuerte,
it's not going to be easy.

1424
01:10:18,380 --> 01:10:19,615
You just do what
you have to do.

1425
01:10:19,715 --> 01:10:23,619
And we'll do what we have to do.

1426
01:10:27,556 --> 01:10:28,624
DANIEL PERRIN: All right.

1427
01:10:28,724 --> 01:10:31,093
You'll all travel in
Joe's truck to El Fuerte.

1428
01:10:31,193 --> 01:10:34,530
He says he can make it
in a couple of hours.

1429
01:10:34,630 --> 01:10:37,266
I'll be flying to Catamaco
on one of the pipers.

1430
01:10:37,366 --> 01:10:39,201
Why are you going to Catamaco?

1431
01:10:39,301 --> 01:10:43,706
The Mexican authorities will
not clear a rescue flight.

1432
01:10:43,806 --> 01:10:45,374
I'll try to change
their minds, but if I

1433
01:10:45,474 --> 01:10:48,043
can't, I'll fly to El Fuerte
with whatever provisions

1434
01:10:48,143 --> 01:10:49,311
I can carry.

1435
01:10:49,411 --> 01:10:52,214
At night?

1436
01:10:52,314 --> 01:10:53,315
No.

1437
01:10:53,415 --> 01:10:54,316
Tomorrow morning.

1438
01:10:58,420 --> 01:11:01,991
[sigh]

1439
01:11:02,091 --> 01:11:03,125
- Rosie.
- Yeah?

1440
01:11:03,225 --> 01:11:04,126
What's going on?

1441
01:11:09,231 --> 01:11:12,735
I thought the brochure
said sun, sea, and sex.

1442
01:11:12,835 --> 01:11:15,838
Well, I guess we missed
the fine print, huh?

1443
01:11:15,938 --> 01:11:16,939
Listen to you.

1444
01:11:17,039 --> 01:11:21,243
[laughter]

1445
01:11:22,211 --> 01:11:23,579
Get it done, girl, huh?

1446
01:11:23,679 --> 01:11:25,414
I will.

1447
01:11:25,514 --> 01:11:27,583
They don't know what's
about to hit them.

1448
01:11:27,683 --> 01:11:28,884
[car starts]

1449
01:11:28,984 --> 01:11:29,785
OK.

1450
01:11:29,885 --> 01:11:32,721
So we'll see you soon.

1451
01:11:32,821 --> 01:11:33,722
Party on, girls!

1452
01:11:36,592 --> 01:11:37,493
Bye!

1453
01:11:49,271 --> 01:11:50,172
We should hurry.

1454
01:11:50,272 --> 01:11:51,640
Why?
[thunder]

1455
01:11:51,740 --> 01:11:52,641
It's going to rain.

1456
01:11:56,345 --> 01:11:57,513
[sigh] Good.

1457
01:12:01,216 --> 01:12:05,688
[determined music]

1458
01:12:11,727 --> 01:12:12,528
[rainfall]

1459
01:12:12,628 --> 01:12:13,696
Here it comes, guys.

1460
01:12:13,796 --> 01:12:14,630
ELIZABETH HAHN: We got
to get her covered up.

1461
01:12:14,730 --> 01:12:15,564
Here.

1462
01:12:15,664 --> 01:12:16,298
ELIZABETH HAHN:
Here, put this on.

1463
01:12:16,398 --> 01:12:17,199
Cover her head.

1464
01:12:17,299 --> 01:12:18,834
I need a poncho or something.

1465
01:12:18,934 --> 01:12:19,735
Quick, quick.

1466
01:12:19,835 --> 01:12:20,636
I'm coming.

1467
01:12:20,736 --> 01:12:21,737
I'm coming.

1468
01:12:21,837 --> 01:12:22,638
Here.

1469
01:12:22,738 --> 01:12:26,041
JILL HOUSTON: That's fine.

1470
01:12:26,141 --> 01:12:27,109
Right here.

1471
01:12:27,209 --> 01:12:27,976
JILL HOUSTON: Thanks.

1472
01:12:28,077 --> 01:12:28,977
Thanks.

1473
01:12:29,078 --> 01:12:30,546
OK.

1474
01:12:30,646 --> 01:12:33,515
Your mom's really something.

1475
01:12:33,615 --> 01:12:36,785
ELIZABETH HAHN:
Here you go, babe.

1476
01:12:36,885 --> 01:12:37,953
Yeah, I know.

1477
01:12:38,053 --> 01:12:38,954
She is.

1478
01:12:51,934 --> 01:12:54,636
What are you reading?

1479
01:12:54,737 --> 01:12:56,572
The Bible.

1480
01:12:56,672 --> 01:12:57,473
Oh, yeah.

1481
01:12:57,573 --> 01:13:01,977
[tire turning]

1482
01:13:08,951 --> 01:13:13,422
[trouble music]

1483
01:13:25,367 --> 01:13:27,336
RULON BEESLEY: Ye, though
I walk through the valley

1484
01:13:27,436 --> 01:13:30,873
of the shadow of death,
I will fear no evil.

1485
01:13:30,973 --> 01:13:33,409
I will fear no evil.

1486
01:13:33,509 --> 01:13:36,912
I will fear no evil,
for thou art with me.

1487
01:13:37,012 --> 01:13:39,081
Thou art with me.

1488
01:13:39,181 --> 01:13:40,315
Thou art with me.

1489
01:13:40,416 --> 01:13:42,584
[gunshot]

1490
01:13:42,684 --> 01:13:45,788
We must be traveling
towards the storm.

1491
01:13:45,888 --> 01:13:47,556
That's not thunder.

1492
01:13:47,656 --> 01:13:48,657
What is it?

1493
01:13:48,757 --> 01:13:49,558
Gunfire.

1494
01:13:49,658 --> 01:13:53,962
[trouble music]

1495
01:13:54,062 --> 01:13:58,333
MAN: [speaking spanish]

1496
01:14:08,677 --> 01:14:13,148
[heavy breathing]

1497
01:14:19,121 --> 01:14:20,689
If it were up to me,
I would send whatever

1498
01:14:20,789 --> 01:14:23,292
aid I had at my disposal.

1499
01:14:23,392 --> 01:14:27,863
I am a man who knows how to
treat my country's friends.

1500
01:14:27,963 --> 01:14:31,033
But, I am in a predicament.

1501
01:14:31,133 --> 01:14:34,036
Los gusanos, the drug
merchants make it so.

1502
01:14:36,738 --> 01:14:41,477
Senor, I am truly sorry.

1503
01:14:41,577 --> 01:14:42,978
I have got to talk to someone.

1504
01:14:43,078 --> 01:14:44,379
Who would that be?

1505
01:14:44,480 --> 01:14:45,781
MAN: Excuse me?

1506
01:14:45,881 --> 01:14:49,418
I went to Mexican air traffic
control and they sent me here.

1507
01:14:49,518 --> 01:14:51,453
They said that you would be
able to give me clearance

1508
01:14:51,553 --> 01:14:53,121
for an air rescue team.

1509
01:14:53,222 --> 01:14:55,524
They were mistaken.

1510
01:14:55,624 --> 01:14:57,459
Then who can get me clearance!

1511
01:15:00,362 --> 01:15:05,334
[ominous music]

1512
01:15:22,784 --> 01:15:27,756
[car struggling]

1513
01:15:43,705 --> 01:15:46,575
You have driven this road
before, haven't you, Joe?

1514
01:15:46,675 --> 01:15:47,476
No.

1515
01:15:47,576 --> 01:15:48,377
Never.

1516
01:15:48,477 --> 01:15:50,846
But my brother has many times.

1517
01:15:50,946 --> 01:15:51,847
Uh-huh.

1518
01:16:06,762 --> 01:16:10,165
You ever flown
through Triple-A before?

1519
01:16:10,265 --> 01:16:11,934
Yep.

1520
01:16:12,034 --> 01:16:13,235
Small arms.

1521
01:16:13,335 --> 01:16:15,070
50 caliber quads.

1522
01:16:15,170 --> 01:16:16,505
Ground artillery.

1523
01:16:16,605 --> 01:16:18,407
Sams missiles.

1524
01:16:18,507 --> 01:16:20,409
I've flown through it.

1525
01:16:20,509 --> 01:16:21,410
Didn't like it much.

1526
01:16:30,085 --> 01:16:32,654
Just hope we get
that clearance.

1527
01:16:32,754 --> 01:16:35,724
I'm going.

1528
01:16:35,824 --> 01:16:38,260
If we don't, they may die.

1529
01:16:38,360 --> 01:16:39,161
I'm taking Lois.

1530
01:16:39,261 --> 01:16:41,129
Martin, we are on deck.

1531
01:16:45,067 --> 01:16:50,472
[ominous music]

1532
01:16:56,378 --> 01:16:59,181
[groaning] Oh, great.

1533
01:16:59,281 --> 01:17:01,049
JILL HOUSTON: It's
not a problem.

1534
01:17:01,149 --> 01:17:04,519
We have more.

1535
01:17:04,620 --> 01:17:09,524
It's-- we probably used
most of it on Eddie, though.

1536
01:17:09,625 --> 01:17:11,059
He's a lot worse
off than you are.

1537
01:17:16,531 --> 01:17:17,432
OK.

1538
01:17:20,335 --> 01:17:23,205
DANAE HAHN: Mom!

1539
01:17:23,305 --> 01:17:24,806
The sun's going down.

1540
01:17:50,599 --> 01:17:51,800
Lay down beside them!

1541
01:17:51,900 --> 01:17:53,101
We have to keep them warm!

1542
01:18:11,153 --> 01:18:13,522
How are you doing?

1543
01:18:13,622 --> 01:18:14,923
Was it my fault?

1544
01:18:15,023 --> 01:18:16,825
Was what your fault--
oh, you mean the crash?

1545
01:18:16,925 --> 01:18:17,859
Uh-huh.

1546
01:18:17,959 --> 01:18:19,294
Oh, I'm not a pilot.

1547
01:18:19,394 --> 01:18:20,295
I'm not.

1548
01:18:20,395 --> 01:18:22,230
You're asking the wrong person.

1549
01:18:22,330 --> 01:18:25,100
I'm not a good pilot.

1550
01:18:25,200 --> 01:18:26,802
My wife is always after me.

1551
01:18:26,902 --> 01:18:29,905
She would like me to do
a little less flying.

1552
01:18:30,005 --> 01:18:31,339
Doctors need getting after.

1553
01:18:31,440 --> 01:18:36,478
[coughing] That
sounds just like her.

1554
01:18:36,578 --> 01:18:39,848
You know, I'm out
at work, or I'm just

1555
01:18:39,948 --> 01:18:45,687
lying down here,
or off somewhere,

1556
01:18:45,787 --> 01:18:50,525
and I realize my wife and I
don't see much of each other.

1557
01:18:50,625 --> 01:18:51,660
Do you still love her?

1558
01:18:54,896 --> 01:18:55,931
Yeah.

1559
01:18:56,031 --> 01:18:58,533
Yeah, I love her very much.

1560
01:18:58,633 --> 01:19:02,204
Well, then I suggest you do
something about this not seeing

1561
01:19:02,304 --> 01:19:04,372
each other stuff at home.

1562
01:19:04,473 --> 01:19:05,574
Yeah.

1563
01:19:05,674 --> 01:19:15,217
Well, I was wondering
if-- if I don't, would you

1564
01:19:15,317 --> 01:19:16,685
call my wife for me?

1565
01:19:16,785 --> 01:19:17,886
I would.

1566
01:19:17,986 --> 01:19:18,754
Yes.

1567
01:19:18,854 --> 01:19:21,356
But I'm not going to need to.

1568
01:19:21,456 --> 01:19:22,324
OK?

1569
01:19:38,573 --> 01:19:39,641
Sí.

1570
01:19:39,741 --> 01:19:46,148
[speaking spanish] Gracias.

1571
01:19:46,248 --> 01:19:48,083
Where's your friend?

1572
01:19:48,183 --> 01:19:50,218
She's getting
medical supplies.

1573
01:19:50,318 --> 01:19:51,820
There's been a development.

1574
01:19:51,920 --> 01:19:53,155
What's that?

1575
01:19:53,255 --> 01:19:54,923
We've been informed that an
American plane is on its way

1576
01:19:55,023 --> 01:19:58,560
to El Fuerte.

1577
01:19:58,660 --> 01:19:59,828
Thank God.

1578
01:20:02,364 --> 01:20:04,266
I'm afraid nothing
has changed, however.

1579
01:20:04,366 --> 01:20:06,401
I must request that you
have them called back.

1580
01:20:09,704 --> 01:20:10,705
Are you serious?

1581
01:20:10,806 --> 01:20:13,141
MAN: Yes, I am.

1582
01:20:13,241 --> 01:20:17,312
We have reports of a gun battle
not far from your people.

1583
01:20:17,412 --> 01:20:19,314
I didn't want to worry you.

1584
01:20:19,414 --> 01:20:20,582
[intense soft music]

1585
01:20:20,682 --> 01:20:23,185
You didn't want to worry me?

1586
01:20:23,285 --> 01:20:30,125
[chuckle] Comandante,
you've got to be

1587
01:20:30,225 --> 01:20:34,396
a man who lives in a big house
behind some very high walls.

1588
01:20:34,496 --> 01:20:38,266
You see my-- my friends
have put their trust in me.

1589
01:20:38,366 --> 01:20:42,637
And above all else, I know
how to treat my friends.

1590
01:20:42,737 --> 01:20:45,707
Just the same, I cannot
take responsibility

1591
01:20:45,807 --> 01:20:47,008
for the safety of this plane!

1592
01:20:47,108 --> 01:20:48,810
Are you willing to take
responsibility for the plane

1593
01:20:48,910 --> 01:20:49,911
if it's shot down?

1594
01:20:50,011 --> 01:20:52,581
Because believe me,
sir, I will see to it

1595
01:20:52,681 --> 01:20:54,416
that you are held responsible!

1596
01:20:59,154 --> 01:21:06,127
Now surely, surely there is
someone that you can call.

1597
01:21:09,364 --> 01:21:11,833
Some way to avoid a
senseless tragedy.

1598
01:21:31,620 --> 01:21:33,221
[speaking spanish]

1599
01:21:33,321 --> 01:21:34,189
Thank you.

1600
01:21:36,892 --> 01:21:37,792
Thank you very much.

1601
01:21:41,997 --> 01:21:45,867

[chuckle]

1604
01:22:18,033 --> 01:22:20,302
Why are we stopping?

1605
01:22:20,402 --> 01:22:22,537
El Fuerte.

1606
01:22:22,637 --> 01:22:23,471
That's El Fuerte?

1607
01:22:23,571 --> 01:22:24,372
Yes.

1608
01:22:24,472 --> 01:22:25,607
The runway.

1609
01:22:25,707 --> 01:22:30,111
[intense music]

1610
01:22:33,581 --> 01:22:35,850
Joe, if somebody is
actually coming down here,

1611
01:22:35,951 --> 01:22:37,118
how are they going to land?

1612
01:22:37,218 --> 01:22:39,387
What do you mean, Elizabeth?

1613
01:22:39,487 --> 01:22:41,222
Well, there's no lights.

1614
01:22:41,323 --> 01:22:43,158
It's going to be dark
here in 10 minutes.

1615
01:22:48,596 --> 01:22:49,664
That could be a problem.

1616
01:22:57,973 --> 01:23:02,310
[night sounds]

1617
01:23:05,747 --> 01:23:09,517
Would anybody happen to
know how to drive this thing?

1618
01:23:09,617 --> 01:23:11,653
Say, uh, say we had to?

1619
01:23:11,753 --> 01:23:12,654
Joe will be back.

1620
01:23:19,361 --> 01:23:20,595
He's barely breathing.

1621
01:23:25,433 --> 01:23:29,471
Jill, you are
the only-- the only

1622
01:23:29,571 --> 01:23:31,940
reason he's alive right now.

1623
01:23:32,040 --> 01:23:33,008
Don't you dare give up.

1624
01:23:41,850 --> 01:23:45,420
[plane radio]

1625
01:23:47,589 --> 01:23:49,791
Roger that, San Diego.

1626
01:23:49,891 --> 01:23:51,493
Just been assured the
army will do their best

1627
01:23:51,593 --> 01:23:53,795
not to shoot us down.

1628
01:23:53,895 --> 01:23:56,998
That's reassuring.

1629
01:23:57,098 --> 01:23:58,733
Well, we should be seeing
the lights of their runway

1630
01:23:58,833 --> 01:24:00,035
any second now.

1631
01:24:00,135 --> 01:24:02,237
According to this, we should
be flying over them right now.

1632
01:24:04,806 --> 01:24:06,908
All I see is black.

1633
01:24:07,008 --> 01:24:11,846
[plane overhead]

1634
01:24:15,216 --> 01:24:16,584
That's got to be them.

1635
01:24:16,684 --> 01:24:18,753
Hey!

1636
01:24:18,853 --> 01:24:19,754
Hey!

1637
01:24:34,502 --> 01:24:36,571
No way anybody's
landing in this darkness.

1638
01:24:39,207 --> 01:24:40,208
- What's that?
- Where?

1639
01:24:40,308 --> 01:24:41,209
There.

1640
01:24:46,614 --> 01:24:48,483
What the?

1641
01:24:48,583 --> 01:24:53,588
[mysterious music]

1642
01:25:01,029 --> 01:25:02,697
What is that?

1643
01:25:02,797 --> 01:25:04,265
ELIZABETH HAHN: I haven't
the faintest idea.

1644
01:25:07,735 --> 01:25:08,636
Look at that.

1645
01:25:43,071 --> 01:25:45,039
Woo-hoo!

1646
01:25:45,140 --> 01:25:46,040
Faster!

1647
01:25:55,016 --> 01:25:59,521
[hopeful music]

1648
01:26:41,029 --> 01:26:42,397
That must be them.

1649
01:26:42,497 --> 01:26:46,801
[chuckle]

1650
01:26:46,901 --> 01:26:47,769
JILL HOUSTON: All right, Joe!

1651
01:26:47,869 --> 01:26:51,272
Yeah

1652
01:27:01,449 --> 01:27:04,252
Strap in for a landing, folks.

1653
01:27:04,352 --> 01:27:05,253
LOIS: Torchlight.

1654
01:27:05,353 --> 01:27:06,421
Middle of the jungle.

1655
01:27:06,521 --> 01:27:08,389
Terrific.

1656
01:27:08,489 --> 01:27:10,658
That's not the half of it.

1657
01:27:10,758 --> 01:27:12,427
That runway looks too short.

1658
01:27:12,527 --> 01:27:17,532
[determined music]

1659
01:27:17,632 --> 01:27:20,001
He's coming in too high.

1660
01:27:20,101 --> 01:27:21,002
Too high.

1661
01:27:30,445 --> 01:27:31,346
Uh-oh!

1662
01:27:37,118 --> 01:27:38,386
What's wrong?
What--

1663
01:27:38,486 --> 01:27:39,587
Runway's too short.

1664
01:27:39,687 --> 01:27:41,923
Oh, my God.

1665
01:27:42,023 --> 01:27:43,558
Let's go around again.

1666
01:27:43,658 --> 01:27:44,726
I think I can make it.

1667
01:28:07,382 --> 01:28:10,285
I'm going to drag her in at
80 knots and plop her down.

1668
01:28:10,385 --> 01:28:11,986
Warn me when we get below 80.

1669
01:28:12,086 --> 01:28:13,521
That doesn't give us
much room for error.

1670
01:28:20,428 --> 01:28:21,863
83.

1671
01:28:21,963 --> 01:28:22,864
82.

1672
01:28:25,833 --> 01:28:27,402
He will make it.

1673
01:28:27,502 --> 01:28:28,770
100 feet.

1674
01:28:28,870 --> 01:28:29,704
79 knots.

1675
01:28:29,804 --> 01:28:30,705
Here we go.

1676
01:28:37,245 --> 01:28:38,046
Come on.

1677
01:28:38,146 --> 01:28:39,147
Come on, come on.

1678
01:29:00,902 --> 01:29:01,903
Oh, yes.

1679
01:29:02,003 --> 01:29:02,804
[soft music]

1680
01:29:02,904 --> 01:29:05,740
[laughing]

1681
01:29:05,840 --> 01:29:07,075
ELIZABETH HAHN:
Let's get them ready.

1682
01:29:19,220 --> 01:29:20,288
Who's in charge here?

1683
01:29:20,388 --> 01:29:21,189
She is.

1684
01:29:21,289 --> 01:29:23,558
She's in charge.

1685
01:29:23,658 --> 01:29:25,860
You know what
to do, Elizabeth.

1686
01:29:25,960 --> 01:29:27,095
OK.

1687
01:29:27,195 --> 01:29:28,663
Yeah, this is LiAnne.

1688
01:29:28,763 --> 01:29:29,897
Head trauma.
You have mannitol?

1689
01:29:29,997 --> 01:29:30,798
Yeah.

1690
01:29:30,898 --> 01:29:32,467
Of course.

1691
01:29:32,567 --> 01:29:33,368
Len's next.

1692
01:29:33,468 --> 01:29:34,369
Jill?

1693
01:29:34,469 --> 01:29:35,269
Yeah.

1694
01:29:35,370 --> 01:29:36,237
His BP is 90 over 60.

1695
01:29:36,337 --> 01:29:37,572
His pulse is thready.

1696
01:29:37,672 --> 01:29:40,842
I need plasmanate and oxygen.
And be careful moving him.

1697
01:29:40,942 --> 01:29:42,176
You're going to
be all right now.

1698
01:29:44,779 --> 01:29:45,580
Watch his head.

1699
01:29:45,680 --> 01:29:46,814
Give me hand, would you?

1700
01:29:46,914 --> 01:29:47,715
OK.

1701
01:29:47,815 --> 01:29:52,086
[chatter]

1702
01:29:55,423 --> 01:29:58,393
[plane takeoff]

1703
01:30:03,498 --> 01:30:07,468
[soft music]
