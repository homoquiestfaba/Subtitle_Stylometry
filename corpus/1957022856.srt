00:00:20,611 --> 00:00:22,405
<i>Oh, God, there must be a better way.</i>

3
00:00:22,572 --> 00:00:26,033
<i>There must be a better way</i>
<i>to describe things,</i>

4
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:30,371
<i>to arrange words in a new way,</i>
<i>to use words,</i>

5
00:00:30,538 --> 00:00:33,958
<i>to take you to a place beyond words.</i>

6
00:00:34,125 --> 00:00:35,501
<i>There must be.</i>

7
00:00:35,668 --> 00:00:38,170
I'm so glad that we could finally
sit down together.

8
00:00:38,337 --> 00:00:42,675
<i>I know we haven't had a chance</i>
<i>to do that since Sonia retired.</i>

9
00:00:42,842 --> 00:00:45,970
I know that she is...
She is very sad to go.

10
00:00:46,137 --> 00:00:49,807
-Understandably, but...
-It's just such a shame.

11
00:00:49,974 --> 00:00:53,769
Retiring at, what, 70? Why?

12
00:00:53,936 --> 00:00:57,398
-Well--
-It doesn't make any sense to me.

13
00:00:57,565 --> 00:01:01,277
Well, I know that...
That her husband obviously hasn't been--

14
00:01:01,444 --> 00:01:05,907
The husband is ill. The children
are needy. The children are 40.

15
00:01:06,073 --> 00:01:10,912
But are more needy than ever.
So that's confusing.

16
00:01:11,078 --> 00:01:14,665
And how long have you been
at the agency?

17
00:01:14,832 --> 00:01:17,251
I know we've spoken on the phone...

18
00:01:17,418 --> 00:01:20,087
...for a couple of years.

19
00:01:20,254 --> 00:01:22,465
Well, I've been...

20
00:01:22,632 --> 00:01:26,427
I think it's been eight years
I've been at the agency now,

21
00:01:26,594 --> 00:01:29,472
and I've been assisting Sonia
for the last seven.

22
00:01:29,639 --> 00:01:33,684
So, actually, I know it may seem
that I'm new, but I've been...

23
00:01:33,851 --> 00:01:35,603
-Gosh.
-...working on your account

24
00:01:35,770 --> 00:01:37,688
and working on your sales,

25
00:01:37,855 --> 00:01:42,485
and I should say that there is
a lot of excitement at the agency

26
00:01:42,652 --> 00:01:45,196
regarding your new manuscript,

27
00:01:45,363 --> 00:01:49,617
and without wanting to pry too much,
is there anything you might be able...

28
00:01:49,784 --> 00:01:53,955
-...to share with us?
-Not really. Not at this point, no.

29
00:01:54,121 --> 00:01:57,959
I'm sorry to be so blunt, but...

30
00:01:58,125 --> 00:02:01,837
Sonia never invaded my process
in any way,

31
00:02:02,004 --> 00:02:03,965
and she always gave me free rein.

32
00:02:04,131 --> 00:02:10,638
She gave me the dignity
and the respect of complete autonomy.

33
00:02:14,141 --> 00:02:17,687
-Everyone's very excited. Um...
-Great.

34
00:02:17,853 --> 00:02:19,981
What do you like about my writing?

35
00:02:20,147 --> 00:02:23,985
I mean, what pulls you to the material?

36
00:02:24,151 --> 00:02:26,612
Well, um...

37
00:02:27,655 --> 00:02:29,365
I have to say, I...

38
00:02:29,532 --> 00:02:34,579
The first book of yours that I read was
<i>You Always, You Never.</i>

39
00:02:34,745 --> 00:02:38,666
-And I was--
-Did you read <i>A Function of the Body?</i>

40
00:02:38,833 --> 00:02:42,378
Was that one of the ones
that you liked?

41
00:02:42,545 --> 00:02:47,091
That was a much, much better book...
Quite frankly.

42
00:02:47,258 --> 00:02:51,220
<i>You Always, You Never,</i>
yes, it has a residual impact.

43
00:02:51,387 --> 00:02:54,390
Uh, it won the Pulitzer, but it's...

44
00:02:54,557 --> 00:02:59,312
It's a completely different thing
than the Footling Prize.

45
00:02:59,478 --> 00:03:02,773
Oh, yes, I meant to bring that up,
actually. They are...

46
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:06,319
They are asking for an answer.
They're... they're...

47
00:03:06,485 --> 00:03:08,988
Obviously, they're hoping
that you'll be able to make it, and...

48
00:03:09,155 --> 00:03:14,493
Do you realize that they don't give the
Footling Prize in fiction every year?

49
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:19,498
It's something that other
writers confer on writers.

50
00:03:19,665 --> 00:03:24,795
-Well--
-I'm so proud, but I just, uh...

51
00:03:24,962 --> 00:03:28,799
I can't attend. I can't attend.

52
00:03:29,842 --> 00:03:32,345
It's killing me.

53
00:03:32,511 --> 00:03:34,805
-But...
-Well--

54
00:03:34,972 --> 00:03:38,142
I can't fly, you see, so...

55
00:03:38,309 --> 00:03:41,062
-I can't fly.
-Do--

56
00:03:41,229 --> 00:03:45,149
-And along with the other things--
-Would you consider...

57
00:03:45,316 --> 00:03:48,945
I mean, there may be a way for you
to get to the UK without having to fly.

58
00:03:49,111 --> 00:03:51,697
I mean, there's a crossing.

59
00:03:51,864 --> 00:03:55,618
There's a ship, the <i>Queen Mary 2,</i>
that goes from New York to Southampton.

60
00:03:55,785 --> 00:03:59,163
I happen to know the
director of the Cunard Line.

61
00:03:59,330 --> 00:04:01,749
You know, they have regular crossings
between--

62
00:04:01,916 --> 00:04:05,044
Transatlantic crossings, and I'm sure...

63
00:04:05,211 --> 00:04:09,257
I'm sure if I spoke to him, they'd be
willing to to give you a state room

64
00:04:09,423 --> 00:04:13,094
and whatever you needed.
I mean, in exchange for...

65
00:04:13,261 --> 00:04:16,681
Perhaps if you did a little talk
on the boat, then...

66
00:04:16,847 --> 00:04:20,518
-Oh, well, I don't think...
-Then something could be arranged.

67
00:04:20,685 --> 00:04:23,354
Just hear me out. I think...

68
00:04:23,521 --> 00:04:26,941
Yes, I think that might be the solution
to be able to get you there,

69
00:04:27,108 --> 00:04:31,195
because, obviously, this prize
means so much to you, as it should,

70
00:04:31,362 --> 00:04:34,323
and I know that they'd be thrilled
if you were able to make it.

71
00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:39,078
And it really is a lovely way to travel.
It's a beautiful ship.

72
00:04:39,245 --> 00:04:40,913
Could I bring guests?

73
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,873
-Yes, of course.
-How many?

74
00:04:45,876 --> 00:04:50,339
And my main feeling is just feeling
like I'm a burden on you, and...

75
00:04:50,506 --> 00:04:53,384
Just, like, shoving myself
in here when, you know...

76
00:04:53,551 --> 00:04:55,511
And I appreciate it.
Mika appreciates it.

77
00:04:55,678 --> 00:04:59,932
You know, I invited you--
May I just remind you?

78
00:05:00,099 --> 00:05:03,978
I invited you.
I'm your mom. I'm your family.

79
00:05:04,145 --> 00:05:07,940
What's that for if not to...

80
00:05:10,192 --> 00:05:12,987
I still don't understand it.

81
00:05:13,154 --> 00:05:17,575
What... How could...
You did this company together.

82
00:05:17,742 --> 00:05:20,036
And I don't understand
how he...

83
00:05:20,202 --> 00:05:23,873
-I think he thinks that I--
-...cut you out. Why he would do that?

84
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:27,293
He used the program
that I had developed or I...

85
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:31,297
It was my idea. He actually did the...
He was the engineer on it.

86
00:05:31,464 --> 00:05:33,215
I don't know, honey.
I really don't know.

87
00:05:33,382 --> 00:05:37,261
I'm clueless, actually, about
what you're going through with this.

88
00:05:37,428 --> 00:05:42,183
That a friend should do this to you is
kind of outrageous.

89
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:45,561
-It's shock... It's...
-It makes me feel violent.

90
00:05:45,728 --> 00:05:49,232
-Mom.
-It does. Easily.

91
00:05:50,358 --> 00:05:53,319
Don't let that motherfucker near me.

92
00:05:53,486 --> 00:05:57,657
Why wouldn't you go on this trip?
I mean, it sounds fascinating.

93
00:05:57,823 --> 00:06:01,577
Well, Cheryl needs more prep time
before her parole hearing.

94
00:06:01,744 --> 00:06:05,581
Mom, the hearing
is six months from now.

95
00:06:05,748 --> 00:06:09,669
-Roberta's going, right?
-Yes, Roberta's definitely going.

96
00:06:10,711 --> 00:06:14,257
And you haven't heard from Alice
since Dad died.

97
00:06:14,423 --> 00:06:16,884
And when did you last see
her and Roberta?

98
00:06:17,051 --> 00:06:21,973
Wow, I don't think we've seen each other
since... Whoa...

99
00:06:22,139 --> 00:06:24,767
Since we all got together
in San Francisco.

100
00:06:24,934 --> 00:06:31,399
-That was, like, when was that?
-That was...that was over 30 years ago.

101
00:06:33,943 --> 00:06:35,945
Well, you got to go.

102
00:06:36,988 --> 00:06:41,075
You have... I think you have to go,
just to find out why she's reaching out.

103
00:06:41,242 --> 00:06:43,452
And why you two? Why now?

104
00:06:46,205 --> 00:06:47,832
-How are you?
-Fine.

105
00:06:47,999 --> 00:06:52,128
So I am very frustrated right now.

106
00:06:52,295 --> 00:06:54,046
-Oh, dear.
-I know.

107
00:06:54,213 --> 00:06:57,717
-I called ahead... Are you Carol?
-No, I am Roberta, as you can see...

108
00:06:57,884 --> 00:06:59,760
-I do see it now.
-If you have eyeballs.

109
00:06:59,927 --> 00:07:03,347
I do. Okay, I called ahead
and spoke to someone named Carol.

110
00:07:03,514 --> 00:07:07,059
Perhaps was your manager, I don't know.
And I don't want to get you in trouble.

111
00:07:07,226 --> 00:07:13,816
But she did tell me that you have
a peacock blue panty and bra set.

112
00:07:13,983 --> 00:07:19,322
And that is what I'm here for,
and all I am seeing is teal.

113
00:07:19,488 --> 00:07:22,074
-So...
-Can I just point out

114
00:07:22,241 --> 00:07:28,581
that the difference between teal
and peacock is as fine as a hair.

115
00:07:28,748 --> 00:07:32,376
Maybe to you. I have a highly developed
sense of color. I'm a designer.

116
00:07:32,543 --> 00:07:36,088
There's too much yellow in this.
Now, let me help you understand.

117
00:07:41,761 --> 00:07:45,056
Clovis, remember,
I am leaving today for two weeks,

118
00:07:45,223 --> 00:07:47,433
and I'll be back on the 16th, okay?

119
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:50,228
-Wait, you're going away?
-Yeah.

120
00:07:50,394 --> 00:07:53,147
I told you all this in the email
about three weeks ago.

121
00:07:53,314 --> 00:07:56,984
-I gave you the whole itinerary.
-I didn't get your email.

122
00:07:57,151 --> 00:07:59,278
-I think you did.
-I didn't get an email from you.

123
00:07:59,445 --> 00:08:02,740
-Because I sent it.
-Okay, can you get someone to cover you?

124
00:08:02,907 --> 00:08:06,661
-'Cause I have you five days next week.
-No, but I think you can.

125
00:08:06,827 --> 00:08:10,248
Because that's your job as manager.
Bye-bye.

126
00:08:15,544 --> 00:08:19,006
<i>Who are the other two people</i>
<i>she invited?</i>

127
00:08:19,173 --> 00:08:22,260
They're her... like, her two
oldest friends from college.

128
00:08:22,426 --> 00:08:25,555
-Really?
-They've been friends for 50 years.

129
00:08:25,721 --> 00:08:28,015
-Jesus.
-Just been chillin'.

130
00:08:28,182 --> 00:08:30,142
Or I guess they haven't seen
each other in a while, I'm not sure.

131
00:08:30,309 --> 00:08:32,436
I don't know, for our generation,

132
00:08:32,603 --> 00:08:35,106
what friendship will look like
over a long period of time.

133
00:08:35,273 --> 00:08:37,316
At least, I've only had friends
for four years at a time,

134
00:08:37,483 --> 00:08:40,069
and these women have been
friends for 50 years, so--

135
00:08:40,236 --> 00:08:44,907
Trying to study them and learn. Maybe
I can learn something from it, you know?

136
00:08:46,909 --> 00:08:51,747
-And, what, she's, like, a TV person?
-No, she's a writer. She's... An author.

137
00:08:51,914 --> 00:08:53,958
-Do you not know this?
-You didn't tell us anything about this.

138
00:08:54,125 --> 00:08:59,088
What do you mean? You don't know
who my aunt is? You don't?

139
00:08:59,255 --> 00:09:02,091
Alice Hughes, <i>You Always, You Never.</i>

140
00:09:02,258 --> 00:09:05,845
It won the Pulitzer Prize. It's been
turned into a movie and a miniseries

141
00:09:06,012 --> 00:09:09,432
in the last, I don't know,
15, 20 years or something.

142
00:09:09,599 --> 00:09:13,895
-You haven't seen it?
-This was years ago? Or this was recent?

143
00:09:14,061 --> 00:09:17,189
I'm really surprised. It's, like...
Well, you should read it.

144
00:09:17,356 --> 00:09:19,525
It's an unbelievable book
and a great movie.

145
00:09:19,692 --> 00:09:22,403
Can you not go? Why would you go?

146
00:09:22,570 --> 00:09:23,988
-Yeah.
-Aw, thanks.

147
00:09:24,155 --> 00:09:26,032
No, it's not a "thanks" moment.

148
00:09:26,198 --> 00:09:29,869
I felt so much love from you
in that moment, so I had to say thanks.

149
00:09:30,036 --> 00:09:33,456
No, I got to go.
I got to go do, um...

150
00:09:33,623 --> 00:09:39,045
I just got to go do my thing, you know?
Take care of these lovely old women.

151
00:09:39,211 --> 00:09:42,381
She desperately wants to accept
the Footling Prize, but she can't fly,

152
00:09:42,548 --> 00:09:45,676
so I've booked her on the <i>Queen Mary 2</i>
with her two friends and her nephew.

153
00:09:45,843 --> 00:09:49,472
I'm not... She gets on the boat,
she takes the boat,

154
00:09:49,639 --> 00:09:54,393
and then you take the boat, too,
for what purpose, exactly?

155
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:59,440
For years, she's been hinting to Sonia
she's revisiting one of her characters.

156
00:09:59,607 --> 00:10:02,652
And we're hoping it's Rowena
from <i>You Always, You Never.</i>

157
00:10:02,818 --> 00:10:05,112
Then again, whenever anyone mentions
<i>You Always, You Never, </i>she slags it off.

158
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:07,698
If she hated that book so much,
why'd she put it out in the first place?

159
00:10:07,865 --> 00:10:09,867
-It was a long time ago, I understand...
-Know what we're gonna get?

160
00:10:10,034 --> 00:10:12,912
Our luck, we're gonna get a sequel
to <i>A Function of the Body.</i>

161
00:10:13,079 --> 00:10:15,248
Well, she did mention she considers
that to be a much better book.

162
00:10:15,414 --> 00:10:18,209
Oh, my God. Of course she did.
Here's a thought.

163
00:10:18,376 --> 00:10:20,211
How about a sequel
to <i>You Always, You Never,</i>

164
00:10:20,378 --> 00:10:24,298
and maybe make it better than the
original? How's that for a bold idea?

165
00:10:24,465 --> 00:10:27,343
I completely agree, which is why
I think I need to be on that ship.

166
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:30,721
It's a big ask. It's not just the cost
of the trip. You'll be out of office.

167
00:10:30,888 --> 00:10:34,600
-I don't see that there's any other way.
-All right.

168
00:10:34,767 --> 00:10:37,645
But if this doesn't work out,
you're gonna wear it.

169
00:10:40,314 --> 00:10:41,691
All right.

170
00:13:48,419 --> 00:13:51,464
-I feel useful. I feel useful.
-Yeah.

171
00:13:51,631 --> 00:13:53,841
-It's a wonderful feeling.
-That's a good feeling.

172
00:13:54,008 --> 00:13:57,303
Sometimes it's a heartbreaking thing
'cause, you know, they won't get parole.

173
00:13:57,470 --> 00:13:59,889
You've been preparing,
and the parole board just...

174
00:14:00,056 --> 00:14:02,558
Yes, yes.

175
00:14:02,725 --> 00:14:05,937
-Anyway, anyway...
-You're fighting the good fight.

176
00:14:06,103 --> 00:14:08,522
I don't know. I'm trying. I'm trying.

177
00:14:08,689 --> 00:14:12,902
The main thing is the connection
with the women...

178
00:14:13,069 --> 00:14:15,321
-Is just such a gift.
-It's everything.

179
00:14:15,488 --> 00:14:16,864
It's a gift.

180
00:14:17,031 --> 00:14:20,493
What about you, Bert?
What have you been up to?

181
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:24,747
Oh, well...
Not much, really, not much.

182
00:14:24,914 --> 00:14:27,708
I don't advocate for anybody except...

183
00:14:27,875 --> 00:14:31,712
I advocate for women's brassieres,
basically. Just...

184
00:14:31,879 --> 00:14:35,424
-For what, hon?
-I sell lingerie.

185
00:14:35,591 --> 00:14:40,012
-Your what, honey? You're in what?
-I sell lingerie.

186
00:14:40,179 --> 00:14:43,307
Tyler, you brought the books.
I've brought you books.

187
00:14:43,474 --> 00:14:45,142
-Oh, how wonderful.
-So that I hope...

188
00:14:45,309 --> 00:14:50,481
I hope you'll look at the <i>Realm</i>
<i>of the Owl, </i>which is her seminal work.

189
00:14:50,648 --> 00:14:56,112
She didn't write very much,
but the work that she did write is...

190
00:14:57,905 --> 00:15:03,369
Groundbreaking, and I think
it's important that we all somehow...

191
00:15:03,536 --> 00:15:09,917
share the work before we go
and stand at her... at her grave.

192
00:15:10,084 --> 00:15:12,753
Thank you.

193
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:19,093
So... speaking of writing, I'm just...
I'm just not going to be available.

194
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:22,305
I've got a draft of a novel
I'm trying to finish.

195
00:15:22,471 --> 00:15:25,016
I have, uh...

196
00:15:25,182 --> 00:15:27,351
This address that's...

197
00:15:27,518 --> 00:15:30,605
You know, they don't give
this prize every year.

198
00:15:30,771 --> 00:15:34,400
-But we'll have supper together and--
-Good. Yes.

199
00:15:34,567 --> 00:15:39,113
You can tell me all the things
that I'm missing out on.

200
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:43,200
Here's to picking up the conversation
where we left off.

201
00:15:43,367 --> 00:15:47,705
You know? And here's to, maybe,

202
00:15:47,872 --> 00:15:52,877
reconnecting the gang
of three we used to be.

203
00:15:53,044 --> 00:15:56,088
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

204
00:15:56,255 --> 00:16:00,718
-Yeah, thank you. Have a good one.
-Good night. Thank you. Good night.

205
00:16:03,054 --> 00:16:06,474
Hey, Bert, want to go
have a drink later?

206
00:16:06,641 --> 00:16:09,268
No, I can't.

207
00:16:32,208 --> 00:16:35,753
<i>Hey, don't freak out.</i>
<i>This is Karen, Alice's agent.</i>

208
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:40,383
<i>I'm actually on this ship. Can you meet</i>
<i>me in the Verandah bar in 15 minutes?</i>

209
00:16:40,549 --> 00:16:41,926
What?

210
00:16:42,927 --> 00:16:46,180
-Hi. Karen?
-Yeah, hi.

211
00:16:46,347 --> 00:16:47,765
-Tyler.
-Nice to meet you.

212
00:16:47,932 --> 00:16:51,060
-Yeah, nice to meet you, too.
-Heard so much about you from Alice.

213
00:16:51,227 --> 00:16:53,271
-Really?
-Yeah.

214
00:16:53,437 --> 00:16:55,815
-Cool.
-Would you like a drink?

215
00:16:55,982 --> 00:17:00,403
-Sure, yeah. What'd you have?
-Vodka soda.

216
00:17:00,570 --> 00:17:05,032
Okay, so can I have a Margarita?

217
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:06,701
-Can you do margarita?
-Yeah, sure.

218
00:17:06,867 --> 00:17:10,913
Oh, it's amazing. I'm a guest
of a friend who's speaking,

219
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:15,710
so I'm very lucky
to get to be on this ship.

220
00:17:15,876 --> 00:17:19,088
I wouldn't have been able to otherwise,
and it's magnificent.

221
00:17:19,255 --> 00:17:22,842
Yeah. You know, I was only in the pub.
They have a pub on here.

222
00:17:23,009 --> 00:17:27,138
I was in the pub, and I actually...
I actually managed to sell...

223
00:17:27,305 --> 00:17:31,142
You're not supposed to do it,
but I actually managed to sell

224
00:17:31,309 --> 00:17:35,730
a big quantity of my shoelaces
to a guy in the pub.

225
00:17:35,897 --> 00:17:39,317
-Yeah, yeah.
-Turned a profit on the ship.

226
00:17:39,483 --> 00:17:43,738
I have already, yeah. I've done that.
I know.

227
00:17:43,905 --> 00:17:46,782
We're turning over a lot of money in it.

228
00:17:46,949 --> 00:17:49,577
How much money would that be?

229
00:17:49,744 --> 00:17:51,579
-Do you want to know?
-Yeah.

230
00:17:51,746 --> 00:17:54,248
-I've just met you. I mean...
-I want to know.

231
00:17:54,415 --> 00:17:56,250
Let me start at the beginning.

232
00:17:56,417 --> 00:18:00,004
Alice has a manuscript
that's due really soon,

233
00:18:00,171 --> 00:18:02,798
and everyone at the agency
is getting a bit nervous

234
00:18:02,965 --> 00:18:05,176
and wondering whether
it's gonna be finished on time,

235
00:18:05,343 --> 00:18:08,596
whether it's gonna be a sequel
to <i>You Always, You Never, and...</i>

236
00:18:08,763 --> 00:18:12,516
The problem is nobody there
has seen a manuscript.

237
00:18:12,683 --> 00:18:16,687
I mean, I haven't seen a manuscript.
Have you seen a manuscript?

238
00:18:16,854 --> 00:18:19,732
No, I have not seen a manuscript.

239
00:18:19,899 --> 00:18:22,818
Okay, the thing is...

240
00:18:22,985 --> 00:18:25,363
I was meant to get some answers
the other day,

241
00:18:25,529 --> 00:18:32,828
and I didn't get any answers, and
if I don't get any information soon...

242
00:18:32,995 --> 00:18:37,667
I'm gonna be in deep shit.
So this is... this is really important.

243
00:18:37,833 --> 00:18:42,296
And I'd really appreciate
it if you could help me out.

244
00:18:42,463 --> 00:18:45,549
I need... It's a really
delicate situation, and...

245
00:18:45,716 --> 00:18:48,344
You know, I don't want to approach her
at the wrong time,

246
00:18:48,511 --> 00:18:52,014
and I can't really get close enough
to see what her frame of mind is.

247
00:18:52,181 --> 00:18:57,228
And I thought maybe you
could maybe give me a heads-up as to...

248
00:18:57,395 --> 00:19:03,192
how she is, whether she's okay,
how's she's feeling and, and then...

249
00:19:03,359 --> 00:19:04,944
-Right.
-Yeah.

250
00:19:29,677 --> 00:19:31,888
Today won't be any different
than any other day.

251
00:19:32,054 --> 00:19:33,431
-Okay.
-And that will be...

252
00:19:33,598 --> 00:19:40,187
I'm going to start work on my manuscript
and then I'm going to swim at 3:00.

253
00:19:40,354 --> 00:19:45,651
Butler will bring-- Pierre will bring me
some sort of lunch, I suppose, at 1:00.

254
00:19:45,818 --> 00:19:50,907
Then I'll swim, and then I'll come back
and work for two more hours.

255
00:19:51,073 --> 00:19:52,909
Six o'clock,
I'll start to get ready for dinner.

256
00:19:53,075 --> 00:19:59,123
Dinner at 7:00 and then back
to work or bed or both.

257
00:20:00,166 --> 00:20:02,209
I'll probably work in bed.

258
00:20:02,376 --> 00:20:07,173
And is there anything
you need from me within...

259
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:09,759
Working before lunch...

260
00:20:09,926 --> 00:20:14,013
No, most of what I want you to do
is I just want you to...

261
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:17,683
Take care of them.
And make sure that they're happy.

262
00:20:17,850 --> 00:20:20,978
I just don't know
what's going on with them.

263
00:20:21,145 --> 00:20:24,649
You know, I tried last night to...
What happened after I left?

264
00:20:24,815 --> 00:20:27,568
-Did you go out with Roberta and Susan?
-Um, no.

265
00:20:27,735 --> 00:20:31,155
Did they go out together? Did they
speak to each other? Did they...

266
00:20:31,322 --> 00:20:35,451
I don't... I don't know.
I was... I just went home.

267
00:20:35,618 --> 00:20:37,995
-And started writing some stuff down.
-You just went home?

268
00:20:38,162 --> 00:20:41,499
-Yeah.
-But, Ty...

269
00:20:43,167 --> 00:20:48,005
Part of what I... I really do want you
to watch out over them.

270
00:20:48,172 --> 00:20:50,841
'Cause I'm not able to be with them,
and I don't know what they're thinking.

271
00:20:51,008 --> 00:20:54,720
I don't know what they're saying.
I don't know... I really...

272
00:20:54,887 --> 00:20:58,933
It's very important to me that I know
something of their state of mind.

273
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:03,729
-Okay. Yeah. Absolutely, I'll, um...
-All right?

274
00:21:03,896 --> 00:21:07,441
-But I just want to...
-That makes me think of something.

275
00:21:07,608 --> 00:21:11,529
Can you hand me the manuscript
that's over there, on the couch?

276
00:21:16,951 --> 00:21:20,246
-And a pen. The red pen.
-Yeah.

277
00:21:20,413 --> 00:21:22,582
Got two pens.

278
00:21:22,748 --> 00:21:24,792
-Thank you, darling.
-Here you go.

279
00:21:24,959 --> 00:21:28,921
Is... is this your new book?

280
00:21:30,464 --> 00:21:33,342
Yeah. This is it.

281
00:21:34,802 --> 00:21:37,346
What's it about?

282
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:44,562
it is about trying to catch
lightning in a bottle

283
00:21:44,729 --> 00:21:47,398
for a second time.

284
00:21:50,067 --> 00:21:51,611
Nice.

285
00:22:05,166 --> 00:22:07,835
<i>She's in her room till 3:00,</i>
<i>then she swims,</i>

286
00:22:08,002 --> 00:22:12,256
<i>then back in her room,</i>
<i>then dinner at 7:00, then bed.</i>

287
00:22:13,716 --> 00:22:15,968
<i>Thanks.</i>

288
00:22:25,603 --> 00:22:28,356
<i>What are you doing after dinner?</i>

289
00:23:09,814 --> 00:23:12,483
Five. Dealer, 21. Sorry.

290
00:23:22,952 --> 00:23:28,165
And I'm so curious to talk to you,
Alice and Roberta,

291
00:23:28,332 --> 00:23:32,003
about what it was like
to come up together

292
00:23:32,169 --> 00:23:37,383
without any technology,
without... to...

293
00:23:37,550 --> 00:23:41,262
I can't help but feel like
you have a glimpse

294
00:23:41,429 --> 00:23:47,143
into the experience
of what it's like to not...

295
00:23:47,310 --> 00:23:52,064
be obscured by any sort
of false selves

296
00:23:52,231 --> 00:23:56,319
or to really be intimate
with each other in moments of...

297
00:23:56,485 --> 00:24:02,617
So I kind of feel like I'm spending time
with three...

298
00:24:02,783 --> 00:24:06,037
-Almost, like...
-Dinosaurs.

299
00:24:06,203 --> 00:24:08,456
-No. I was gonna say...
-I'm teasing you.

300
00:24:08,623 --> 00:24:10,583
-Well, I know...
-I'm teasing you.

301
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:15,254
I just think that there's...
It is true that after your generation,

302
00:24:15,421 --> 00:24:20,509
I don't know who will carry the torch
for...

303
00:24:20,676 --> 00:24:25,348
What really...
What humanity really is.

304
00:24:25,514 --> 00:24:28,476
I don't think it's that different,
you know?

305
00:24:28,643 --> 00:24:34,190
I know it's vastly different
when you look at it from the outside.

306
00:24:34,357 --> 00:24:37,193
And what's happened
to your generation...

307
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:40,655
I mean, since you were two,
you've been typing away,

308
00:24:40,821 --> 00:24:45,243
and so you've grown up with this thing
like an appendage on you, you know?

309
00:24:45,409 --> 00:24:47,912
But I think that...

310
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:54,126
Depending on what you join up with
on, you know, the computer...

311
00:24:54,293 --> 00:24:58,339
Facebook or Instagram
or whatever you're joining up with...

312
00:24:58,506 --> 00:25:00,591
Or not...

313
00:25:00,758 --> 00:25:05,930
That human communication
is basically the same because

314
00:25:06,097 --> 00:25:07,974
humans are basically the same.

315
00:25:42,341 --> 00:25:44,427
So, who should I sign this to?

316
00:25:44,594 --> 00:25:47,638
Arabella. It'd be very nice.

317
00:25:47,805 --> 00:25:51,392
-That's my granddaughter.
-Granddaughter?

318
00:25:51,559 --> 00:25:56,397
-Yeah, she's only about, 15 years old?
-She's seven today. It's her birthday.

319
00:25:56,564 --> 00:25:58,357
-It's her birthday?
-She's on board, yeah.

320
00:25:58,524 --> 00:26:01,193
-She's on board? Where is she?
-Oh, yeah, she's by the pool.

321
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:03,905
-By the pool?
-Naturally.

322
00:26:04,071 --> 00:26:08,159
Well, that's... Can she swim?

323
00:26:14,749 --> 00:26:18,127
Okay, so don't look all
at the same time,

324
00:26:18,294 --> 00:26:21,672
but does anybody know who that guy is,
sitting behind me to the right?

325
00:26:21,839 --> 00:26:26,052
He was surrounded by a group
of fans earlier today.

326
00:26:26,219 --> 00:26:29,513
Oh, I think that's him.

327
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:31,474
-I know that's him.
-Who?

328
00:26:31,641 --> 00:26:35,186
-Who?
-Kelvin Kranz!

329
00:26:35,353 --> 00:26:37,271
-Who?
-Who is he?

330
00:26:37,438 --> 00:26:39,982
-He's a writer.
-He's a huge mystery writer.

331
00:26:40,149 --> 00:26:43,819
-He's written hundreds of books.
-Have you read any of them?

332
00:26:43,986 --> 00:26:45,655
-Oh, all of them.
-Almost all of them.

333
00:26:45,821 --> 00:26:50,660
-Every one of them. Some twice.
-Good Lord. How is that possible?

334
00:26:50,826 --> 00:26:54,664
-How is that possible...
-It's a thrill... He's not like you.

335
00:26:54,830 --> 00:26:58,501
Nothing like you at all.
He's a thriller, a mystery writer.

336
00:26:58,668 --> 00:27:01,045
-A thriller writer.
-Yes, I understand.

337
00:27:01,212 --> 00:27:04,507
What I don't understand...

338
00:27:04,674 --> 00:27:06,717
is how people...

339
00:27:06,884 --> 00:27:11,639
How you can read the...
The prose just...

340
00:27:11,806 --> 00:27:14,517
That kind of writing seems to me like...

341
00:27:14,684 --> 00:27:17,228
The prose seems like Styrofoam
or something.

342
00:27:17,395 --> 00:27:21,607
-But it's plot-driven.
-Yes, but the plots are so simplified.

343
00:27:21,774 --> 00:27:24,402
It's like a jigsaw puzzle. You know,
you match the color and the shape,

344
00:27:24,569 --> 00:27:27,697
and then you put it all together.
It's all very pat and neat and done.

345
00:27:27,863 --> 00:27:32,159
And then, you know, it's a picture
that's completely unrelated to life.

346
00:27:32,326 --> 00:27:34,662
Life is a mystery, a true mystery.

347
00:27:34,829 --> 00:27:39,333
-It's true.
-Yes. I can't wait for the next one.

348
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:42,878
And also, it's like a puzzle
you get to solve.

349
00:27:43,045 --> 00:27:46,048
-Maybe I'll go over there.
-No, no, don't.

350
00:27:46,215 --> 00:27:49,010
No, not yet. Don't...

351
00:27:49,176 --> 00:27:50,887
Wait until later.

352
00:27:52,555 --> 00:27:54,056
-Thank you.
-Ma'am, pleasure.

353
00:27:54,223 --> 00:27:57,810
-Why don't we go get a drink tonight?
-Oh, I can't.

354
00:27:57,977 --> 00:27:59,729
I'm going to the masquerade ball.

355
00:28:02,690 --> 00:28:05,610
Sounds like fun.

356
00:28:23,586 --> 00:28:25,880
<i>Can you hang out?</i>

357
00:28:27,548 --> 00:28:28,925
Fuck, yeah.

358
00:28:47,026 --> 00:28:50,029
I saw the manuscript.

359
00:28:50,196 --> 00:28:52,949
Just saw it. I didn't...
I asked her what it was about.

360
00:28:53,115 --> 00:28:58,704
She was not really interested
in sharing, but she did say that

361
00:28:58,871 --> 00:29:05,461
it's about... trying to catch lightning
in a bottle for the second time.

362
00:29:10,841 --> 00:29:14,637
Lightning in a bottle
for the second time, that...

363
00:29:14,804 --> 00:29:17,890
That could mean a sequel. Right?

364
00:29:20,977 --> 00:29:24,855
Yeah, I suppose it could.
I think it could mean a lot of things.

365
00:29:25,022 --> 00:29:27,233
Well, that's pretty exciting.

366
00:29:51,716 --> 00:29:55,011
I thought that was the direction
I was gonna take my life in,

367
00:29:55,177 --> 00:30:00,141
and I went to college,
and I sort of... I don't know.

368
00:30:00,308 --> 00:30:02,101
The more I separated from my dad,

369
00:30:02,268 --> 00:30:05,897
the more I saw actually
how sketchy of a guy he was.

370
00:30:06,063 --> 00:30:10,151
He was, like...
kind of an ignorant human being

371
00:30:10,318 --> 00:30:13,905
in his politics and his...

372
00:30:14,071 --> 00:30:18,034
Just kind of the way he treated...

373
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:22,288
people and specifically,
I think, women.

374
00:30:22,455 --> 00:30:25,166
And...

375
00:30:25,333 --> 00:30:28,961
And... Yeah, and then...

376
00:30:29,128 --> 00:30:35,468
He actually got sent to jail
because he...

377
00:30:35,635 --> 00:30:41,140
blackmailed some very important people
at the top of these companies

378
00:30:41,307 --> 00:30:44,518
that... that that he worked for.

379
00:30:44,685 --> 00:30:48,689
-Yeah.
-I don't know if you heard about that.

380
00:30:48,856 --> 00:30:52,485
-Yeah, I heard something about that.
-Yeah, that's my dad.

381
00:30:52,652 --> 00:30:56,030
-Anyway...
-It's okay.

382
00:30:56,197 --> 00:31:01,702
So... Are you even or odd?
I'm odd.

383
00:31:01,869 --> 00:31:04,997
-I'm even.
-Okay.

384
00:31:05,164 --> 00:31:06,666
-All right.
-Good night.

385
00:31:06,832 --> 00:31:11,337
-Good night. See you tomorrow?
-Yeah, definitely.

386
00:31:11,504 --> 00:31:13,673
-Okay.
-Okay.

387
00:31:41,492 --> 00:31:47,999
So it's strange to me the idea
that she would come here and avoid you.

388
00:31:48,165 --> 00:31:52,295
It's very strange to me. It's strange
because she jumped at the opportunity.

389
00:31:52,461 --> 00:31:54,755
You know, she jumped at the invitation.

390
00:31:54,922 --> 00:32:00,761
Susan, it took two weeks for her to make
the arrangements to be able to leave.

391
00:32:00,928 --> 00:32:05,725
Then maybe she's trying...
She wanted to come here to...

392
00:32:05,892 --> 00:32:07,935
To make you uneasy.

393
00:32:09,186 --> 00:32:11,439
Oh, I don't...

394
00:32:11,606 --> 00:32:13,482
-Or she wanted--
-Do you think she did?

395
00:32:13,649 --> 00:32:15,318
Well, maybe not as a whole,
but, you know, some...

396
00:32:15,484 --> 00:32:21,991
Like, when I was a kid, I would get mad
at my parents and yell at them

397
00:32:22,158 --> 00:32:24,493
to see that they loved me.

398
00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:26,537
Do you know what I mean?
I would hurt them.

399
00:32:26,704 --> 00:32:30,374
And when I saw the hurt in their eyes,
that told me they loved me.

400
00:32:30,541 --> 00:32:33,169
And that was a way
of comforting myself.

401
00:32:33,336 --> 00:32:36,422
Oh, gosh, well, that's a horrible,
horrible thought.

402
00:32:36,589 --> 00:32:40,092
I hope that's not... That's true,
and I'm sorry that happened to you.

403
00:32:40,259 --> 00:32:42,845
Well, I did it, so...

404
00:32:43,012 --> 00:32:45,431
Yes, but I don't think you...

405
00:32:45,598 --> 00:32:51,187
I'm sure your mother came through for
you, but I can't imagine that Bud did.

406
00:32:51,354 --> 00:32:52,730
Right.

407
00:32:52,897 --> 00:32:58,945
Okay, this is the closest that I've been
able to come to a viable candidate,

408
00:32:59,111 --> 00:33:01,572
Murray Dix.
He makes shoelaces.

409
00:33:01,739 --> 00:33:05,826
I wish it were a little more glamorous,
but I think he's got dough.

410
00:33:05,993 --> 00:33:10,373
I need you to find out
how much dough he really has.

411
00:33:10,539 --> 00:33:16,295
Is it liquid?
What's his marital history? Was...

412
00:33:16,462 --> 00:33:22,385
Did he abuse a wife? Did he...
I mean, am I gonna survive if I...

413
00:33:23,803 --> 00:33:26,681
Are there any red flags?
Did he do time?

414
00:33:26,847 --> 00:33:31,269
That would not be good
for my reputation, among other things.

415
00:33:31,435 --> 00:33:34,105
Right. Right.

416
00:33:34,272 --> 00:33:38,109
-So can you--
-You want me to do a forensic deep dive.

417
00:33:38,276 --> 00:33:41,153
-Yes, I know you can do that.
-If you will... Yeah, I got you.

418
00:34:04,468 --> 00:34:06,846
Where is it?

419
00:34:36,167 --> 00:34:38,586
Oh, my God.

420
00:34:54,769 --> 00:34:56,687
What?

421
00:35:02,985 --> 00:35:06,113
Okay, that's a blemish.

422
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:10,660
But he was acquitted.
Isn't that the important thing?

423
00:35:41,148 --> 00:35:43,776
-Hey.
-Hey.

424
00:35:44,986 --> 00:35:47,572
-How's it going?
-Yeah, good. How are you?

425
00:35:47,738 --> 00:35:50,366
I'm doing well.

426
00:35:50,533 --> 00:35:51,993
How you feeling today?

427
00:35:52,159 --> 00:35:56,956
I hate my life. I loathe my job.

428
00:35:57,123 --> 00:35:59,083
I...

429
00:35:59,250 --> 00:36:02,628
I desperately want money.

430
00:36:02,795 --> 00:36:07,842
I really want money, and I'm not
in a position to meet a guy who has any.

431
00:36:08,009 --> 00:36:11,721
I mean, I get these old codgers
who come into the store,

432
00:36:11,888 --> 00:36:14,557
and they want to buy a thong
for their teenage girlfriends,

433
00:36:14,724 --> 00:36:17,810
while I'm old, rotten meat for them.

434
00:36:17,977 --> 00:36:19,604
-They're not interested.
-Oh, honey.

435
00:36:19,770 --> 00:36:21,355
But, um...

436
00:36:21,522 --> 00:36:27,987
You really do believe that Alice and her
book just determined your whole life?

437
00:36:29,363 --> 00:36:31,699
Don't you?

438
00:36:31,866 --> 00:36:38,331
I know I'm not the quickest person
around the place, but...

439
00:36:38,497 --> 00:36:45,254
I read Alice's book. It never
crossed my mind that it was you.

440
00:36:45,421 --> 00:36:49,550
It never crossed my mind
that it was Crawford.

441
00:36:49,717 --> 00:36:55,139
It never crossed my mind
that that mechanic guy...

442
00:36:55,306 --> 00:36:59,518
had anything to do with Roberta.

443
00:36:59,685 --> 00:37:02,063
Nothing.
It never crossed my mind.

444
00:37:02,230 --> 00:37:05,399
Even though the character's
name was Rowena?

445
00:37:05,566 --> 00:37:07,818
Why would I put that with you?

446
00:37:07,985 --> 00:37:11,822
Well, it crossed everyone else's mind,
Susan.

447
00:37:11,989 --> 00:37:14,867
It certainly crossed Crawford's.

448
00:37:16,494 --> 00:37:20,873
And the judge agreed with him,
so, you know, what...

449
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:24,460
-I got nothing.
-Oh, God, that's so awful.

450
00:37:24,627 --> 00:37:26,712
-Look, he was...
-That's so awful.

451
00:37:26,879 --> 00:37:31,551
He was a nice man. He was very wealthy.
He took very good care of me.

452
00:37:32,718 --> 00:37:34,554
-Until...
-He didn't.

453
00:37:36,931 --> 00:37:39,892
So are you seeing anyone
at the moment?

454
00:37:40,059 --> 00:37:43,896
No, no one right now.

455
00:37:44,063 --> 00:37:46,315
I, um...

456
00:37:46,482 --> 00:37:51,946
Okay, so the weirdest thing happened
this morning. That guy...

457
00:37:52,113 --> 00:37:56,242
I think, was coming out of Alice's room

458
00:37:56,409 --> 00:37:59,787
when I went to go see her for breakfast.

459
00:37:59,954 --> 00:38:01,831
-What?
-Yeah.

460
00:38:01,998 --> 00:38:04,375
Like, like, he'd stayed the night?

461
00:38:04,542 --> 00:38:09,338
-Maybe. I don't know. Does that--
-Do you think they're having an affair?

462
00:38:09,505 --> 00:38:14,010
Again, yeah, I don't know, but it...
I don't know why else...

463
00:38:14,176 --> 00:38:18,931
he'd be leaving her room
or why she wouldn't tell me, but...

464
00:38:19,098 --> 00:38:21,559
Maybe she's having a secret affair.
Good for her.

465
00:38:21,726 --> 00:38:25,438
I know, yeah. Oh, God.

466
00:38:25,605 --> 00:38:28,399
So I moved out,
and I lived on my own for a bit,

467
00:38:28,566 --> 00:38:32,528
and then I got introduced
to this guy called Jan,

468
00:38:32,695 --> 00:38:38,451
who is a hedge fund manager, and he
works between New York and Zurich.

469
00:38:38,618 --> 00:38:41,370
So we started seeing each other.

470
00:38:41,537 --> 00:38:44,040
And things seemed
to be going pretty well.

471
00:38:44,206 --> 00:38:47,043
We moved in together.

472
00:38:47,209 --> 00:38:51,088
I really felt like I was in a grown-up
relationship for the first time.

473
00:38:51,255 --> 00:38:54,383
Like, he's quite serious.

474
00:38:54,550 --> 00:38:57,386
Like, I felt like it was time that I...
that I calmed down.

475
00:38:57,553 --> 00:39:01,307
Like, I don't know why I thought that,
but in my mind I was like, you know,

476
00:39:01,474 --> 00:39:04,644
"It's time to grow up."
Like, "This is it. He's the guy."

477
00:39:04,810 --> 00:39:09,023
"I'm gonna get married.
I'm gonna have kids with him."

478
00:39:09,190 --> 00:39:14,904
And I'm just... "This is the next phase
of my life." That's what I thought.

479
00:39:15,071 --> 00:39:17,240
We talked about children,
but he said he wasn't sure

480
00:39:17,406 --> 00:39:20,034
and he didn't know when he'd be ready,
so, you know...

481
00:39:20,201 --> 00:39:25,790
He said, why don't I freeze my eggs?
So last year I... I did that.

482
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:31,254
Even though, like, I thought
that I'd be ready, like, now.

483
00:39:31,420 --> 00:39:33,297
I mean, most of my friends
have had kids and...

484
00:39:33,464 --> 00:39:37,802
-Right.
-You know, they've got families and...

485
00:39:37,969 --> 00:39:40,429
I don't know, it's funny when
you get to this age as a woman.

486
00:39:40,596 --> 00:39:44,850
You feel a bit like if you're
not doing that, you're gonna be...

487
00:39:45,017 --> 00:39:48,479
Well, you're gonna miss your chance
or you're gonna be, like...

488
00:39:48,646 --> 00:39:50,773
...left behind.

489
00:39:50,940 --> 00:39:53,359
-Sorry, it's just...
-No, it's all right. Are you all right?

490
00:39:53,526 --> 00:39:58,614
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine.
I just haven't really talked about this.

491
00:39:59,657 --> 00:40:02,034
Sorry.

492
00:40:02,201 --> 00:40:04,870
It's ridiculous, really.

493
00:40:05,037 --> 00:40:08,291
I don't know.

494
00:40:08,457 --> 00:40:10,668
It's so crazy, you go through your 20s,
and you're, like,

495
00:40:10,835 --> 00:40:12,753
"I better not fucking get pregnant
'cause that would be a disaster."

496
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:16,173
And then when you hit 35, everyone's
like, "Are you thinking about it?"

497
00:40:16,340 --> 00:40:18,259
Like, should you...
"Are you gonna have kids?"

498
00:40:18,426 --> 00:40:21,888
So it all kind of changes so quickly,

499
00:40:22,054 --> 00:40:25,516
I thought that that was gonna happen,
that Jan and I were gonna get married.

500
00:40:25,683 --> 00:40:30,521
So it just, like, threw me when,
like two months ago, he...

501
00:40:30,688 --> 00:40:33,649
Well, he just ended it. And...

502
00:40:33,816 --> 00:40:38,863
Like, I was basically homeless
'cause it was his place. And...

503
00:40:40,573 --> 00:40:46,078
Yeah, I'm just... Guess I'm just
still working through all of that.

504
00:41:01,719 --> 00:41:03,095
-Good afternoon.
-Hello.

505
00:41:03,262 --> 00:41:09,060
Uh, I was given this gift certificate
for a supreme manicure and pedicure,

506
00:41:09,227 --> 00:41:12,605
which is very nice, but I don't like
people touching my hands or feet,

507
00:41:12,772 --> 00:41:15,066
so I would like to redeem it
for cash, please.

508
00:41:15,233 --> 00:41:19,862
We can't do that, madam, but we can
offer you another treatment instead.

509
00:41:20,029 --> 00:41:22,990
Uh, could I redeem it...

510
00:41:23,157 --> 00:41:25,159
Could you put it on my credit card?

511
00:41:25,326 --> 00:41:27,787
Unfortunately, no,
because it is a complimentary one,

512
00:41:27,954 --> 00:41:30,706
so we would be able to just transfer it
to a different treatment.

513
00:41:30,873 --> 00:41:33,042
Let me show you
what we have available.

514
00:41:33,209 --> 00:41:37,380
For the money that you have,
you can have any of these.

515
00:41:37,546 --> 00:41:40,591
Do men get massages here, too?

516
00:41:40,758 --> 00:41:42,802
We do. We do do massages
for everyone, yes.

517
00:41:42,969 --> 00:41:45,638
Do you have any men getting
a massage at the moment?

518
00:41:45,805 --> 00:41:49,058
-We do at the moment, yes, madam.
-What kind of massage are they getting?

519
00:41:49,225 --> 00:41:51,686
They have all sorts of...
All the different types we do.

520
00:41:51,852 --> 00:41:55,106
At the moment, we have got a gentleman
in. He's having a sports massage.

521
00:41:55,273 --> 00:41:57,483
Ah, well, I would like
to have the sports massage.

522
00:41:57,650 --> 00:41:59,068
-The sports massage? Okay.
-Yes, please.

523
00:42:09,036 --> 00:42:12,081
-They're the same price?
-Same price, yes.

524
00:42:12,248 --> 00:42:16,043
Let's say we went to the Bordeaux,
just in case.

525
00:42:16,210 --> 00:42:20,381
He went like this.
Now he's going like this.

526
00:42:20,548 --> 00:42:24,385
Why don't you go up to him
and, and talk to him?

527
00:42:24,552 --> 00:42:28,097
-Tyler, I would never do that.
-He really seems...

528
00:42:28,264 --> 00:42:32,059
Oh, my God. You can't be intimidated
by Kelvin Kra...

529
00:42:32,226 --> 00:42:34,103
-Kelvin--
-Oh, my God.

530
00:42:34,270 --> 00:42:38,149
He seemed really nice to all the people
who were going up to him yesterday.

531
00:42:38,316 --> 00:42:42,111
Really? Oh, I'm not surprised.

532
00:42:42,278 --> 00:42:44,488
I think he's probably a lovely man.

533
00:42:44,655 --> 00:42:48,326
Speaking of writing,
how is yours going?

534
00:42:51,621 --> 00:42:54,916
Thank you for asking me that.

535
00:42:59,128 --> 00:43:02,882
Well, it's... it's not going, actually.

536
00:43:03,049 --> 00:43:08,137
It's not going.
I've been whining to Tyler about it.

537
00:43:08,304 --> 00:43:11,432
I'm sorry for doing that, but I just...

538
00:43:11,599 --> 00:43:15,144
I've hit a... I've hit a wall.
Sometimes it happens.

539
00:43:15,311 --> 00:43:19,273
Sometimes you hit... You're blocked.

540
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:22,026
Well, maybe you should take
a breather.

541
00:43:22,193 --> 00:43:25,655
You want to have tea tomorrow?
We could go to the...

542
00:43:25,821 --> 00:43:27,657
The Chart Room has a nice tea.

543
00:43:30,910 --> 00:43:32,620
I would love to.

544
00:43:36,540 --> 00:43:39,293
I didn't know
whether you'd be up for it,

545
00:43:39,460 --> 00:43:41,128
but have you been
to a planetarium before?

546
00:43:41,295 --> 00:43:43,673
No. Never.
Or maybe when I was a kid.

547
00:43:43,839 --> 00:43:48,261
Okay. Do you like stars,
planets, the universe?

548
00:43:48,427 --> 00:43:54,058
-Yeah, I love the universe.
-Okay. Hopefully, you should enjoy this.

549
00:43:54,225 --> 00:43:58,854
<i>The night sky,</i>
<i>both beautiful and mysterious.</i>

550
00:43:59,021 --> 00:44:01,941
<i>The subject of campfire stories,</i>

551
00:44:02,108 --> 00:44:04,402
<i>ancient myths, and awe</i>

552
00:44:04,569 --> 00:44:07,196
<i>for as long as there have been people.</i>

553
00:44:07,363 --> 00:44:09,657
<i>Living beneath the open, dark sky,</i>

554
00:44:09,824 --> 00:44:13,619
<i>the earliest humans</i>
<i>were aware of nightly changes</i>

555
00:44:13,786 --> 00:44:16,330
<i>as planets marched across the sky.</i>

556
00:44:16,497 --> 00:44:18,374
<i>The moon waxed and waned,</i>

557
00:44:18,541 --> 00:44:22,587
<i>and occasional meteors flared</i>
<i>across the horizon.</i>

558
00:44:22,753 --> 00:44:26,048
<i>Slowly, the simple early observations</i>

559
00:44:26,215 --> 00:44:28,968
<i>revealed patterns</i>
<i>that could be depended upon,</i>

560
00:44:29,135 --> 00:44:31,804
<i>leading to the first calendars.</i>

561
00:44:31,971 --> 00:44:34,265
<i>With the yearly cycle mapped out,</i>

562
00:44:34,432 --> 00:44:37,101
<i>settlements in agriculture</i>
<i>could develop,</i>

563
00:44:37,268 --> 00:44:40,229
<i>and early civilizations thrived.</i>

564
00:44:40,396 --> 00:44:43,190
<i>At the same time,</i>
<i>the first maps of the sky</i>

565
00:44:43,357 --> 00:44:47,278
<i>grouped the brightest stars</i>
<i>into familiar constellations,</i>

566
00:44:47,445 --> 00:44:51,115
<i>helping to develop</i>
<i>navigational schemes...</i>

567
00:45:25,191 --> 00:45:27,235
-Good evening, madam.
-Hello.

568
00:45:27,401 --> 00:45:30,363
How can I help you?
I think you seem to be lost.

569
00:45:30,529 --> 00:45:32,156
No, I'm not lost. I'm just wandering.

570
00:45:32,323 --> 00:45:36,077
You're not actually allowed in this
area, this is part of the crew area.

571
00:45:36,244 --> 00:45:37,954
-Oh, okay.
-And you're not insured.

572
00:45:38,120 --> 00:45:40,915
-So, if anything does happen...
-Okay, where shall I go?

573
00:45:41,082 --> 00:45:44,001
So where would you like to go,
and I can escort you, please?

574
00:45:44,168 --> 00:45:45,544
Okay, no problem.

575
00:46:37,805 --> 00:46:40,641
Kelvin Kranz is on this ship?

576
00:46:41,851 --> 00:46:44,645
<i>Wait, is he...</i>
<i>Is that a really big deal?</i>

577
00:46:44,812 --> 00:46:47,690
-Come on, you have to have heard of him.
-No, I've never heard of him.

578
00:46:47,857 --> 00:46:50,067
I mean, he's huge.

579
00:46:50,234 --> 00:46:52,778
Like, the guy's a one-man
publishing industry.

580
00:46:52,945 --> 00:46:56,949
Every single one of his books gets
adapted into a film, in every language.

581
00:46:57,116 --> 00:46:59,535
-His books have been translated into.
-Okay, Kelvin.

582
00:46:59,702 --> 00:47:03,581
He's massive. Like, bigger
than all of them combined, like...

583
00:47:03,748 --> 00:47:06,042
-Good for... good for Kelvin.
-Yeah.

584
00:47:06,208 --> 00:47:08,294
Good for that guy.

585
00:47:08,461 --> 00:47:12,131
So I had a thought that I was...

586
00:47:12,298 --> 00:47:14,967
Do you... Do you like dancing?

587
00:47:15,134 --> 00:47:16,719
-Dancing?
-Yeah.

588
00:47:16,886 --> 00:47:21,349
-Like, just for fun?
-No, there's a dance club on the boat.

589
00:47:21,515 --> 00:47:23,517
I think it's like a disco-type spot,

590
00:47:23,684 --> 00:47:27,355
and I figured maybe we could go,
if you were interested.

591
00:47:28,439 --> 00:47:29,815
Okay.

592
00:47:47,250 --> 00:47:50,253
Yeah. Thanks for doing that with me.

593
00:47:50,419 --> 00:47:51,796
-It was fun.
-It was fun. Yeah.

594
00:47:51,963 --> 00:47:54,257
-Good night.
-Good seeing you.

595
00:47:54,423 --> 00:47:56,801
-See you.
-All right, have a good one.

596
00:48:19,782 --> 00:48:22,034
Gosh, I just realized.

597
00:48:22,201 --> 00:48:25,454
Last night I had a dream.

598
00:48:25,621 --> 00:48:27,665
I guess...

599
00:48:29,292 --> 00:48:34,005
Maybe that's why I thought about not...
not losing touch.

600
00:48:34,171 --> 00:48:40,052
I had a dream that a friend of mine
that is no longer alive

601
00:48:40,219 --> 00:48:42,305
came to me.

602
00:48:43,931 --> 00:48:47,435
I was aware that I was dreaming.

603
00:48:47,602 --> 00:48:50,062
I was aware that...

604
00:48:52,356 --> 00:48:56,569
This person was saying to me,
"This is how we'll communicate now."

605
00:48:56,736 --> 00:48:59,906
Oh, no way.

606
00:49:00,072 --> 00:49:02,658
Oh, my God.

607
00:49:02,825 --> 00:49:05,703
Yeah.

608
00:49:05,870 --> 00:49:09,749
Yeah. We never lose...

609
00:49:09,916 --> 00:49:12,168
Never lose people.

610
00:49:13,210 --> 00:49:14,587
Gosh.

611
00:49:20,384 --> 00:49:23,512
-Hey, gorgeous.
-Hey.

612
00:49:23,679 --> 00:49:26,641
Do you understand this thing?

613
00:49:28,226 --> 00:49:30,394
Do you know what you're gonna say?

614
00:49:30,561 --> 00:49:34,440
I'm gonna say that
actions have consequences,

615
00:49:34,607 --> 00:49:41,405
and the consequences on my life
of her actions were unacceptable.

616
00:49:41,572 --> 00:49:44,951
And the least she could do
is apologize.

617
00:49:47,662 --> 00:49:51,374
How do you think she's gonna take that?

618
00:49:51,540 --> 00:49:53,960
She'll go...

619
00:49:54,126 --> 00:49:59,257
Well, I... She'll, she'll deny it.
She'll say that... She'll deny it.

620
00:49:59,423 --> 00:50:04,470
She'll say it was based
on someone entirely different.

621
00:50:06,973 --> 00:50:09,976
Doesn't that look
like Professor Osbourne?

622
00:50:10,142 --> 00:50:14,730
-I didn't see him.
-It's a dead ringer for Prof. Osbourne.

623
00:50:14,897 --> 00:50:17,900
-Remember him?
-I... How...

624
00:50:18,067 --> 00:50:21,195
If I'd seen him, I wouldn't have reacted
like you are.

625
00:50:21,362 --> 00:50:24,949
-Oh, my God.
-What went on?

626
00:50:25,116 --> 00:50:27,910
Nothing, nothing. I'm just...

627
00:50:28,077 --> 00:50:30,538
I don't think so.

628
00:50:30,705 --> 00:50:32,623
I had a threesome
with him and his wife.

629
00:50:32,790 --> 00:50:35,001
Well...

630
00:50:36,210 --> 00:50:38,546
Well, well, well...

631
00:50:41,591 --> 00:50:44,886
-Is that all?
-Yeah. It was just a threesome.

632
00:50:45,052 --> 00:50:48,097
It wasn't a foursome or a fivesome...

633
00:50:48,264 --> 00:50:50,433
It wasn't an orgy.

634
00:51:33,559 --> 00:51:36,729
That can't really be your first time...

635
00:51:37,730 --> 00:51:39,774
Karen.

636
00:51:42,235 --> 00:51:44,654
Heard a rumor you were on the ship.

637
00:51:44,820 --> 00:51:46,864
Well, it's no rumor.

638
00:52:02,088 --> 00:52:05,132
There's a big majority.
I mean, we've got ex-service people.

639
00:52:05,299 --> 00:52:09,971
We've got guys that have come up
through the self-improvement.

640
00:52:10,137 --> 00:52:13,140
You know, and those guys are generally
very, very enthusiastic

641
00:52:13,307 --> 00:52:17,937
'cause they've spent a lot of money
to get to where they are.

642
00:52:18,104 --> 00:52:21,399
So, you tend to look after them
a little bit more. You know, they'll...

643
00:52:21,566 --> 00:52:25,444
They tend to want to understand
the market.

644
00:52:25,611 --> 00:52:28,614
With the ex-service guys,
they're independent.

645
00:52:28,781 --> 00:52:33,786
You can get them to go out and do a job.
They don't need any support

646
00:52:33,953 --> 00:52:35,997
from within the company.

647
00:52:36,163 --> 00:52:39,959
But, you know, my job is
to sort of oversee what's going on

648
00:52:40,126 --> 00:52:42,670
and count the money as it comes in.

649
00:52:42,837 --> 00:52:44,672
-That's probably fun.
-Yeah.

650
00:52:44,839 --> 00:52:48,467
Would you mind if we moved
into the room next door?

651
00:52:48,634 --> 00:52:50,678
-Not at all, not at all.
-Great. Let's do that.

652
00:52:50,845 --> 00:52:52,680
-Love to follow you in.
-I'm meeting someone.

653
00:52:52,847 --> 00:52:57,685
I mean, I like the ambition, truly.
But what is your plan?

654
00:52:57,852 --> 00:53:03,232
My plan was to approach her
at the right point.

655
00:53:03,399 --> 00:53:06,527
-You think that's a bad idea?
-I think it's a terrible idea.

656
00:53:06,694 --> 00:53:09,196
I don't think you can approach her
at all on this boat.

657
00:53:09,363 --> 00:53:12,575
I think you will scare her away.

658
00:53:12,742 --> 00:53:19,540
I think that she might appreciate
your tenacity, but really...

659
00:53:20,625 --> 00:53:25,004
She's gonna decide what she does,
and it's really out of your control.

660
00:53:25,171 --> 00:53:29,300
-Right, it's what...
-Absolutely. The shine on the tables.

661
00:53:29,467 --> 00:53:33,721
-The decor is so...
-Yeah. Alice, Alice.

662
00:53:33,888 --> 00:53:35,848
Oh. Hi.

663
00:53:36,015 --> 00:53:41,103
Alice... Sorry, this is Alice Hughes.
This is Vernon.

664
00:53:41,270 --> 00:53:43,314
-Vernon, hello.
-Vernon. Pleased to meet you.

665
00:53:43,481 --> 00:53:46,359
-Pleasure.
-He's in aviation.

666
00:53:46,525 --> 00:53:48,819
-Well...
-Would you like to join us?

667
00:53:48,986 --> 00:53:50,613
Please.

668
00:53:50,780 --> 00:53:52,865
Oh. No, it's all right.

669
00:53:53,032 --> 00:54:00,039
I was just wandering around the ship
and passed the florist and thought,

670
00:54:00,206 --> 00:54:03,251
"Why am I carrying this around
like a fool?"

671
00:54:03,417 --> 00:54:05,962
Let me, um, set it here.

672
00:54:06,128 --> 00:54:08,005
Maybe I'll see you at dinner.

673
00:54:08,172 --> 00:54:10,216
-You... Definitely.
-Nice to meet you.

674
00:54:10,383 --> 00:54:11,759
-Look forward to it.
-Pleasure.

675
00:54:11,926 --> 00:54:14,345
-Take care.
-Bye.

676
00:54:16,931 --> 00:54:20,434
-She seems nice.
-Yeah, she's a very fine writer.

677
00:54:20,601 --> 00:54:23,271
We went to university together.

678
00:54:23,437 --> 00:54:28,234
I mean, it's madness, really.
What, you want her to write a...

679
00:54:28,401 --> 00:54:31,362
-A sequel to... Yeah.
-A sequel to this?

680
00:54:31,529 --> 00:54:33,322
I mean, everyone wants her
to write a sequel to this.

681
00:54:33,489 --> 00:54:38,119
Yeah, but she's never gonna do that.
The book's her antichrist.

682
00:54:38,286 --> 00:54:39,787
Don't you think?

683
00:54:48,546 --> 00:54:51,173
<i>Tyler, it's Roberta. I need your help.</i>

684
00:54:55,052 --> 00:54:57,763
Sorry, sometimes it takes a little while
'cause she could be...

685
00:54:57,930 --> 00:55:00,057
There are two floors,
so she could be upstairs.

686
00:55:00,224 --> 00:55:03,477
-There... there's two floors?
-Yeah.

687
00:55:04,520 --> 00:55:07,273
It's a big one. Yeah.

688
00:55:10,568 --> 00:55:14,113
So, here's the pen and paper.

689
00:55:14,280 --> 00:55:16,616
Oh, thank you.

690
00:55:16,782 --> 00:55:18,993
Okay.

691
00:55:35,259 --> 00:55:38,387
Someday, that book's gonna end.

692
00:55:49,398 --> 00:55:52,485
I want to lead you today

693
00:55:52,652 --> 00:55:55,571
on a... on a tour

694
00:55:55,738 --> 00:56:00,159
through the landscape
of my inspiration.

695
00:56:00,326 --> 00:56:04,080
Sometimes the sources
that a writer uses

696
00:56:04,247 --> 00:56:07,625
are very close to home...

697
00:56:07,792 --> 00:56:12,463
Family, friends, enemies.

698
00:56:14,131 --> 00:56:17,176
And sometimes
our source is a visitor

699
00:56:17,343 --> 00:56:21,597
from another time, another universe.

700
00:56:21,764 --> 00:56:26,519
Blodwen Pugh... was a Welsh writer

701
00:56:26,686 --> 00:56:30,648
at the turn of the last century,
the end of the 19th century.

702
00:56:30,815 --> 00:56:34,986
She worked in obscurity,
she was completely unrecognized

703
00:56:35,152 --> 00:56:37,905
until well after her death.

704
00:56:38,072 --> 00:56:40,992
And even now,
she's quite unfamiliar,

705
00:56:41,158 --> 00:56:46,414
even to many in the most
rarefied literary circles. She's...

706
00:56:46,581 --> 00:56:51,294
She's lost to us, except for those
who stand still enough to listen.

707
00:56:52,253 --> 00:56:55,631
The writings, her one remain...
her one novel,

708
00:56:55,798 --> 00:57:01,971
which is called, I think it's
the masterpiece of that... of that era

709
00:57:02,138 --> 00:57:04,765
is called "Realm of the Owl."

710
00:57:04,932 --> 00:57:07,518
When I read this novel,

711
00:57:07,685 --> 00:57:11,063
it's... it's impossible for me

712
00:57:11,230 --> 00:57:15,526
not to think what a miracle it is
that this universe emerged.

713
00:57:15,693 --> 00:57:21,866
What a miracle it is
that consciousness emerged.

714
00:57:22,033 --> 00:57:24,118
You know?

715
00:57:26,495 --> 00:57:30,833
And what a miracle it is
that Blodwyn Pugh...

716
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:34,420
her thoughts and experiences...

717
00:57:34,587 --> 00:57:38,549
that they could reach across time...

718
00:57:40,593 --> 00:57:45,097
and reach into my consciousness.

719
00:57:46,307 --> 00:57:48,726
That's a miracle.

720
00:57:48,893 --> 00:57:51,103
Any questions?

721
00:57:53,231 --> 00:57:55,942
Well, I have a question.

722
00:57:56,108 --> 00:58:00,529
I mean, I don't know, it certainly raise
to Blodwyn Pugh's "Realm of the Owl,"

723
00:58:00,696 --> 00:58:05,576
but I have a question
about "A Function of the Body",

724
00:58:05,743 --> 00:58:09,622
and specifically when you
were inspired to write it,

725
00:58:09,789 --> 00:58:15,670
did you always know you'll gonna insert
Georgia's diaries through the book?

726
00:58:17,213 --> 00:58:21,217
I thought it was
exquisitely crafted in that way.

727
00:58:22,260 --> 00:58:25,179
And, I mean, everyone knows
it's a very personal book.

728
00:58:25,346 --> 00:58:29,058
It's known, so I don't feel
badly saying that.

729
00:58:29,225 --> 00:58:34,188
I mean, the way you did that with her...
With the loss of her sister,

730
00:58:34,355 --> 00:58:38,818
the ne'er-do-well brother
who's sort of a psychopath,

731
00:58:38,985 --> 00:58:44,824
whom you need, you know, whom you need,
and who you're terrified of.

732
00:58:44,991 --> 00:58:47,493
It... The way those diaries worked

733
00:58:47,660 --> 00:58:52,790
just raised it to the highest level
of... of literature for me.

734
00:58:52,957 --> 00:58:56,794
I'm wondering how you...
how you... how you did that.

735
00:58:56,961 --> 00:58:59,505
-Did you know you were gonna do it or--
-Oh, thank you.

736
00:58:59,672 --> 00:59:02,216
Thank you very much for that question.

737
00:59:11,350 --> 00:59:14,145
-My dad, at least.
-Oh, my.

738
00:59:14,312 --> 00:59:16,564
Oh, my. Oh.

739
00:59:16,731 --> 00:59:20,443
-Your friends have come.
-My friends, I want you to meet Roberta.

740
00:59:20,610 --> 00:59:22,111
-Hello.
-What a great pleasure.

741
00:59:22,278 --> 00:59:24,488
-And Susan.
-What a good pleasure.

742
00:59:24,655 --> 00:59:27,783
Kelvin Kranz. And my nephew Tyler.

743
00:59:27,950 --> 00:59:30,328
-Hey, Tyler. Handsome young man.
-Oh, nice to meet you.

744
00:59:30,494 --> 00:59:33,748
Nice to meet you.
So you all, you're traveling together.

745
00:59:33,915 --> 00:59:37,418
Yes. You have a table
full of fans here, you know?

746
00:59:37,585 --> 00:59:43,090
Really? Well, that's fantastic,
you know. Thank you.

747
00:59:43,257 --> 00:59:47,178
So you must be all going
to "The Toad and the Harrow"...

748
00:59:47,345 --> 00:59:49,972
-Oh, well, yes...
-Are you taking your friends over?

749
00:59:50,139 --> 00:59:51,557
-Is that what's happening here?
-Yes.

750
00:59:51,724 --> 00:59:54,727
But first, we're gonna make
a little pilgrimage

751
00:59:54,894 --> 00:59:59,148
to Blodwyn Pugh's gravesite
outside Cardiff. The convent.

752
00:59:59,315 --> 01:00:02,026
-How wonderful. That's special.
-Yeah, yeah, I think...

753
01:00:02,193 --> 01:00:06,697
I think it'll be sort of special, but...

754
01:00:06,864 --> 01:00:11,702
I wanted to ask you, how long
does it take you to write one of your...

755
01:00:11,869 --> 01:00:15,581
-one of your books?
-To write one?

756
01:00:15,748 --> 01:00:18,751
Well, I spend about, maybe,

757
01:00:18,918 --> 01:00:25,800
a month outlining it, and then, maybe,
three months writing it,

758
01:00:25,967 --> 01:00:27,677
so maybe four months...

759
01:00:27,843 --> 01:00:30,805
At the outside, some of them
maybe four and a half.

760
01:00:30,972 --> 01:00:34,517
I try to... I've never done
anything faster than three months.

761
01:00:34,684 --> 01:00:37,478
That's longer than I thought.

762
01:00:37,645 --> 01:00:39,564
Well...

763
01:00:39,730 --> 01:00:44,151
That's interesting.
It's a process, isn't it?

764
01:00:44,318 --> 01:00:48,573
Well, I have a certain process.
It's pretty specific, you know?

765
01:00:48,739 --> 01:00:51,158
Well, anyway...

766
01:00:51,325 --> 01:00:54,870
-Congratulations on getting the prize.
-Oh, thank you so much.

767
01:00:55,037 --> 01:00:57,164
It's a great honor.
I think it's very special.

768
01:00:57,331 --> 01:01:00,459
-And what a pleasure to meet you all.
-Thank you. You too.

769
01:01:00,626 --> 01:01:02,795
-Thank you. Thank you.
-I'll see you again, yeah.

770
01:01:02,962 --> 01:01:05,715
And you. I'll see you again.
Take care, bye-bye.

771
01:01:05,881 --> 01:01:07,884
-Bye-bye.
-Have a nice supper.

772
01:01:08,050 --> 01:01:10,052
Thank you. You too.

773
01:01:12,305 --> 01:01:13,973
What a nice man.

774
01:01:16,309 --> 01:01:19,979
-What a gent, isn't he?
-What a gentleman. Classy.

775
01:01:23,608 --> 01:01:26,819
-Missed you today.
-Yes, I know. I'm sorry.

776
01:01:26,986 --> 01:01:29,363
-Why don't we go now? Have a drink?
-I can't.

777
01:01:29,530 --> 01:01:31,532
-Why?
-'Cause I'm going to the gala.

778
01:01:31,699 --> 01:01:33,659
Oh, the gala.

779
01:01:33,826 --> 01:01:35,912
Okay.

780
01:01:47,381 --> 01:01:49,425
They're such iconic characters.

781
01:01:49,592 --> 01:01:53,346
It is perfect for American characters
right now because the border of...

782
01:01:53,512 --> 01:01:55,473
-Hey.
-Hi.

783
01:01:55,640 --> 01:01:57,058
-You're here. Great.
-You guys have met, haven't you?

784
01:01:57,225 --> 01:01:58,809
Yeah.

785
01:01:58,976 --> 01:02:02,021
-How's it going? Sorry to interrupt.
-No, you're not interrupting at all.

786
01:02:02,188 --> 01:02:05,441
-We're just finishing. Good to see you.
-Good to see you, man.

787
01:02:05,608 --> 01:02:08,444
-Leave you to it. To be continued?
-Yes.

788
01:02:08,611 --> 01:02:11,656
-We'll see each other again soon.
-Yeah.

789
01:02:11,822 --> 01:02:15,159
-Sorry to run you out of town.
-No, are you kidding?

790
01:02:15,326 --> 01:02:17,745
Have a good one.

791
01:02:17,912 --> 01:02:22,375
-How's it going?
-Does he know who you are?

792
01:02:22,541 --> 01:02:25,461
Oh, yeah. Yeah, he knows, he knows.

793
01:02:25,628 --> 01:02:27,672
-And that doesn't bother you?
-He's cool. Don't worry.

794
01:02:27,838 --> 01:02:31,551
No, he... He's not gonna say anything.
Don't worry.

795
01:02:31,717 --> 01:02:35,179
So you know that him and Alice
are now friends, they're talking.

796
01:02:35,346 --> 01:02:37,890
Yeah. Yeah, no, I, um...

797
01:02:38,057 --> 01:02:41,185
Actually, I told him everything and...

798
01:02:41,352 --> 01:02:45,815
He found the whole thing
quite amusing, actually.

799
01:02:45,982 --> 01:02:48,359
And he gave me some good advice.
He, uh...

800
01:02:48,526 --> 01:02:51,237
He told me he thinks it's probably
not gonna be a good idea

801
01:02:51,404 --> 01:02:57,076
for me to approach Alice on this trip,
so I'm gonna back off, and...

802
01:02:57,243 --> 01:02:59,203
-Yeah, I think he's right.
-Great.

803
01:03:42,747 --> 01:03:46,417
Did you get that note, by the way,
that we left in your room?

804
01:03:46,584 --> 01:03:48,753
What... A note is nothing.

805
01:03:48,920 --> 01:03:53,466
I mean, she made a date with me,
and, for tea.

806
01:03:53,633 --> 01:03:56,260
And I went,
and I interrupted my work.

807
01:03:56,427 --> 01:04:00,223
It's not like I have hours
and hours to wander the ship...

808
01:04:00,389 --> 01:04:02,266
-Right.
-And, you know, meet men.

809
01:04:02,433 --> 01:04:05,519
-This is not what I'm here for.
-So you went, and then what happened?

810
01:04:05,686 --> 01:04:08,814
I went to tea at two o'clock sharp,
and there she was,

811
01:04:08,981 --> 01:04:13,986
sitting there like a beanbag
next to this dodo who was her date.

812
01:04:14,153 --> 01:04:17,657
And, clearly, I wasn't, you know...

813
01:04:17,823 --> 01:04:21,160
So she canceled it? It was canceled.
You didn't meet with her.

814
01:04:21,327 --> 01:04:25,957
Well, I don't know what we were supposed
to do, have a meeting with a...

815
01:04:26,123 --> 01:04:29,126
-A dodo?
-A person that... Yes.

816
01:04:29,293 --> 01:04:34,507
I shouldn't say that. He's probably
a perfectly nice, unsuspecting man,

817
01:04:34,674 --> 01:04:40,888
who didn't know that he was, you know,
in the talons of a carrion bird.

818
01:04:41,055 --> 01:04:43,349
But I don't know what...
I don't know what she's...

819
01:04:43,516 --> 01:04:47,144
I don't know what she wants,
because I just want to reach her.

820
01:04:47,311 --> 01:04:48,729
Right.

821
01:04:48,896 --> 01:04:51,691
Do you remember when you and Alice and I
met in San Francisco

822
01:04:51,857 --> 01:04:53,693
all those years ago?

823
01:04:53,859 --> 01:04:57,405
That's when it all hit the fan.

824
01:04:58,573 --> 01:05:03,494
I just was desperate
to confide in someone,

825
01:05:03,661 --> 01:05:08,541
and the two of you were the closest
I've ever been with, so...

826
01:05:11,043 --> 01:05:15,047
When we had dinner at the bar afterward,
you went upstairs and went to bed,

827
01:05:15,214 --> 01:05:18,509
and it was just me and Alice,
and I thought...

828
01:05:18,676 --> 01:05:23,431
"Well, Alice has always been interested
in other people's lives."

829
01:05:25,433 --> 01:05:29,520
And then I made the fatal mistake
of telling Alice everything.

830
01:05:33,482 --> 01:05:36,193
What I realize is...

831
01:05:36,360 --> 01:05:40,740
if you can't keep a secret yourself...

832
01:05:40,907 --> 01:05:44,118
You can't ask anyone else
to keep a secret.

833
01:05:45,494 --> 01:05:47,747
It's true.

834
01:05:49,373 --> 01:05:51,375
It's true.

835
01:06:08,601 --> 01:06:12,063
What I'm gonna tell you is this.

836
01:06:14,273 --> 01:06:18,194
I didn't go upstairs
to sleep that night.

837
01:06:20,947 --> 01:06:25,201
There was a really...
a really cute waiter,

838
01:06:25,368 --> 01:06:27,662
and...

839
01:06:30,289 --> 01:06:32,792
This is a...

840
01:06:34,293 --> 01:06:37,463
Double letter, triple word.

841
01:06:38,464 --> 01:06:40,967
-Baby.
-I hate you.

842
01:06:41,133 --> 01:06:43,970
Bow down, bitch. Bow down.

843
01:06:44,136 --> 01:06:47,014
They have this incredible night
together. They get really drunk.

844
01:06:47,181 --> 01:06:49,725
They drink loads of cocktails.

845
01:06:49,892 --> 01:06:53,271
And, yeah, they just get on really well.
They hook up.

846
01:06:53,437 --> 01:06:57,775
And she doesn't know that this guy
is actually just a bartender.

847
01:06:57,942 --> 01:07:01,696
Like, he's not a rich guy
or anything, like...

848
01:07:01,862 --> 01:07:06,409
But they fall for each other,
and it's this comedy of errors.

849
01:07:06,576 --> 01:07:10,371
It's kind of a farce. But they end up
falling for each other,

850
01:07:10,538 --> 01:07:13,916
despite the fact that they both pretend
to be something that they're not.

851
01:07:14,083 --> 01:07:16,460
Which is kind of the...
yeah, the whole thing.

852
01:07:16,627 --> 01:07:20,423
-And do you know who plays the guy?
-He's this... He's this comedian.

853
01:07:20,590 --> 01:07:25,636
He's funny. He's got this amazing face.
But it's just such a charming film.

854
01:07:25,803 --> 01:07:28,431
-You have to see it. It's brilliant.
-I want to see it.

855
01:07:28,598 --> 01:07:31,976
I'm trying to think of, like...
I was actually in a comedy of errors

856
01:07:32,143 --> 01:07:35,563
when I was in sixth grade,
so when you brought that up...

857
01:07:40,109 --> 01:07:42,612
Karen?

858
01:07:42,778 --> 01:07:44,739
Hi.

859
01:07:45,740 --> 01:07:48,659
And Tyler?

860
01:07:48,826 --> 01:07:50,995
Hi.

861
01:07:52,455 --> 01:07:53,831
Wait.

862
01:08:03,382 --> 01:08:06,761
So you lied for her because...

863
01:08:08,679 --> 01:08:10,723
you like her.

864
01:08:18,314 --> 01:08:23,903
That's... that's as good a reason
to lie as any I can think of.

865
01:08:29,951 --> 01:08:31,994
So...

866
01:08:38,626 --> 01:08:41,420
You're gonna see her tonight?

867
01:08:42,505 --> 01:08:44,382
I don't know.

868
01:08:53,307 --> 01:08:56,936
Who's that man I keep seeing
coming out of your room in the morning?

869
01:09:02,191 --> 01:09:04,986
Oh, that man.

870
01:09:11,450 --> 01:09:14,495
That man is...

871
01:09:14,662 --> 01:09:18,749
probably the one thing
that keeps me going.

872
01:09:21,586 --> 01:09:24,088
Besides you.

873
01:09:24,255 --> 01:09:25,631
Thanks.

874
01:09:25,798 --> 01:09:30,636
They all take ballroom-dancing classes
on this ship.

875
01:09:30,803 --> 01:09:32,805
So, when they go to the gala,

876
01:09:32,972 --> 01:09:36,475
they want to show off what they've
learned, and they take it very...

877
01:09:36,642 --> 01:09:39,729
-Hi.
-Hey. How are you? What a surprise.

878
01:09:39,896 --> 01:09:42,773
-Fine, fine.
-Very breezy day to have...

879
01:09:42,940 --> 01:09:46,736
-Yeah, I love the fog.
-...an intimate little discussion.

880
01:09:46,903 --> 01:09:50,364
-You know, I've been thinking about you.
-Really?

881
01:09:50,531 --> 01:09:54,952
Well, one of the women that I work with

882
01:09:55,119 --> 01:09:59,290
poisoned her husband,
who was a batterer,

883
01:09:59,457 --> 01:10:02,835
and guess where
she got the idea.

884
01:10:03,002 --> 01:10:05,755
From my first wife, of course.

885
01:10:05,922 --> 01:10:09,508
-Or maybe my second wife.
-Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh.

886
01:10:09,675 --> 01:10:12,803
-No, no, but now I know a lot about you.
-Yes.

887
01:10:12,970 --> 01:10:16,891
No. From an early
Agatha Christie book.

888
01:10:17,058 --> 01:10:21,562
<i>-The Murder of Roger Ackroyd.</i>
-Exactly. <i>The Murder of Roger Ackroyd.</i>

889
01:10:21,729 --> 01:10:24,941
Well, I kept that away from her.

890
01:10:25,107 --> 01:10:27,026
And that's why you still stand.

891
01:10:27,193 --> 01:10:31,530
So you've been thinking about poisoning,
but why? I mean, just because...

892
01:10:31,697 --> 01:10:33,532
Oh, no, because I...

893
01:10:33,699 --> 01:10:38,496
This woman was incarcerated for trying
to save her child and herself.

894
01:10:38,663 --> 01:10:41,582
And she didn't want to kill him,
she just wanted to disable him

895
01:10:41,749 --> 01:10:44,085
so she could stop the violence.

896
01:10:44,252 --> 01:10:46,629
But he died.

897
01:10:46,796 --> 01:10:49,840
-I'm so sorry. That's awful.
-Yes, it is awful.

898
01:10:50,007 --> 01:10:51,384
Do you deal with a lot of people
who poison?

899
01:10:51,551 --> 01:10:54,762
I do. Oh, no, no. Not so many...

900
01:10:54,929 --> 01:11:01,352
I mean, they take whatever weapon...
the domes-- Is in the person's hand.

901
01:11:01,519 --> 01:11:03,896
-And...
-Can I join? Do you mind if I sit down?

902
01:11:04,063 --> 01:11:05,648
-Of course, sit down.
-No, join us.

903
01:11:05,815 --> 01:11:08,234
-I've been fascinated by poison lately.
-Why?

904
01:11:08,401 --> 01:11:12,905
I'm thinking about writing something
about someone who poisons people.

905
01:11:13,072 --> 01:11:18,452
I think it's... I think,
philosophically, poisoning is a...

906
01:11:18,619 --> 01:11:22,832
a very intimate way to kill someone,
and it's also very cruel.

907
01:12:43,788 --> 01:12:45,456
How is that?

908
01:12:47,917 --> 01:12:50,127
Very compelling.

909
01:13:10,481 --> 01:13:12,608
-Hey.
-Sorry.

910
01:13:12,775 --> 01:13:16,028
-Sorry I'm late. Thank you.
-Hello.

911
01:13:18,114 --> 01:13:20,533
-Everybody well?
-Everybody's well.

912
01:13:20,700 --> 01:13:25,496
-How is work going?
-Oh, well, not as...

913
01:13:25,663 --> 01:13:28,165
Not as well as I'd like.

914
01:13:28,332 --> 01:13:31,711
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

915
01:13:32,878 --> 01:13:35,715
Where's Tyler?

916
01:13:35,881 --> 01:13:37,884
Not coming.

917
01:13:38,050 --> 01:13:41,095
-No?
-He has a date.

918
01:13:42,847 --> 01:13:48,603
-Who with?
-Uh, someone he met on the ship.

919
01:13:49,937 --> 01:13:52,273
So...

920
01:13:52,440 --> 01:13:55,401
An older woman... Apparently.

921
01:13:55,568 --> 01:14:00,114
-An older woman? How much older?
-Like, in her 80s?

922
01:14:02,950 --> 01:14:05,536
I would be surprised
if that were the case.

923
01:14:05,703 --> 01:14:09,248
-But he probably means 26 or...
-Oh. Oh, right.

924
01:14:09,415 --> 01:14:11,000
Thirty-six.

925
01:14:11,167 --> 01:14:15,129
Thirty-six would be
a significant difference.

926
01:14:15,296 --> 01:14:18,424
-Or more. Who knows?
-Really?

927
01:14:18,591 --> 01:14:20,718
I can't tell people's ages anymore.

928
01:14:20,885 --> 01:14:23,471
-No, I can't either.
-I really can't.

929
01:14:24,972 --> 01:14:27,183
Alice, I don't know
what your schedule is,

930
01:14:27,350 --> 01:14:30,519
but if you're free tomorrow
before or after you swim,

931
01:14:30,686 --> 01:14:34,357
maybe we could have a tea
or a drink.

932
01:14:35,524 --> 01:14:37,693
Well, I...

933
01:14:39,028 --> 01:14:42,865
I would love to do that, but I actually
have a business meeting tomorrow.

934
01:14:43,032 --> 01:14:46,661
-Oh, sorry.
-I don't know if I'll get my swim in.

935
01:14:46,827 --> 01:14:50,790
Who knows how long it'll go on
or what will happen in it?

936
01:14:50,957 --> 01:14:55,127
-But let's do it another time. Promise?
-Yeah, I'd love to. Great.

937
01:14:58,589 --> 01:15:02,260
-Quite a day.
-Yeah.

938
01:15:02,426 --> 01:15:04,387
Shocking.

939
01:15:05,596 --> 01:15:07,473
Yeah.

940
01:15:09,100 --> 01:15:10,643
How you feeling?

941
01:15:12,728 --> 01:15:15,690
I'm feeling okay, actually.
Kind of...

942
01:15:16,732 --> 01:15:20,152
-A bit relieved, to be honest.
-Yeah.

943
01:15:21,946 --> 01:15:23,864
I should actually say to you, like...

944
01:15:28,160 --> 01:15:29,996
Yeah, I feel like
I should apologize a bit.

945
01:15:30,162 --> 01:15:32,164
I feel bad for dragging you
into this whole thing.

946
01:15:32,331 --> 01:15:36,877
I know you didn't want to lie to your
aunt, and I slightly twisted your arm

947
01:15:37,044 --> 01:15:39,255
and I feel bad about that,

948
01:15:39,422 --> 01:15:42,508
and she clearly thinks
so highly of you.

949
01:15:42,675 --> 01:15:45,261
She loves you. She thinks,
you know, she thinks the world of you,

950
01:15:45,428 --> 01:15:50,433
and that was obvious when
I spoke to her today. And I think...

951
01:15:50,600 --> 01:15:55,605
That was probably part of the reason why
she was so forgiving towards me. So...

952
01:15:55,771 --> 01:15:59,775
Thank you for... Yeah,
thanks for everything this, this week.

953
01:15:59,942 --> 01:16:01,736
-Oh, well...
-You've been amazing.

954
01:16:01,903 --> 01:16:07,325
I know I've completely inappropriately
unloaded a whole load of stuff onto you

955
01:16:07,491 --> 01:16:11,203
that I probably shouldn't have done,
so I'm sorry about that, and...

956
01:16:11,370 --> 01:16:14,749
-Yeah, thank you.
-Well, that's... That's sweet of you.

957
01:16:14,916 --> 01:16:20,296
I appreciate that acknowledgement,
and I...

958
01:16:21,380 --> 01:16:25,343
It's been... It's so been my
pleasure getting to know you, and...

959
01:16:25,509 --> 01:16:30,139
I was skeptical at first about
what our relationship would look like.

960
01:16:30,306 --> 01:16:33,351
And I just felt like...

961
01:16:33,517 --> 01:16:36,020
I don't know. I just really
wanted to get to know you,

962
01:16:36,187 --> 01:16:40,566
and I'm excited to hopefully
continue to get to know you. And...

963
01:16:42,485 --> 01:16:45,071
I don't know, maybe, you know,
what our... what...

964
01:16:45,238 --> 01:16:50,743
What our life can look like...
moving forward.

965
01:16:50,910 --> 01:16:53,537
Like, I don't know. There's just...

966
01:16:53,704 --> 01:16:56,666
Maybe, um...

967
01:16:56,832 --> 01:17:00,836
It's just been probably
one of the biggest gifts

968
01:17:01,003 --> 01:17:05,132
of the... the ship for me
has been...

969
01:17:06,634 --> 01:17:09,470
Getting to know you, so...

970
01:17:18,312 --> 01:17:22,858
I was, uh, wondering if...

971
01:17:27,113 --> 01:17:31,075
I know this is kind
of a crazy question, but...

972
01:17:34,954 --> 01:17:38,124
If maybe you wanted to...

973
01:17:41,419 --> 01:17:43,212
If...

974
01:17:43,379 --> 01:17:46,465
You're not gonna ask me out,
are you?

975
01:17:46,632 --> 01:17:49,010
I'm joking, I'm joking.
You just suddenly looked so awkward.

976
01:17:49,176 --> 01:17:51,721
Right. Right. I did. I was...

977
01:17:51,888 --> 01:17:57,685
I was wondering if maybe I could
kiss you at some point soon.

978
01:18:11,115 --> 01:18:13,409
Fuck.

979
01:18:17,496 --> 01:18:19,624
Oh, shit.

980
01:18:43,648 --> 01:18:47,318
I think I...

981
01:18:47,485 --> 01:18:49,820
made a...

982
01:18:49,987 --> 01:18:53,366
a bit of a fool of myself.

983
01:18:58,162 --> 01:19:00,248
In what way?

984
01:19:00,414 --> 01:19:07,672
I just... I made some kind of an advance
that didn't... That went un...

985
01:19:07,838 --> 01:19:10,758
Unreciprocated.

986
01:19:15,763 --> 01:19:17,932
Well, you can't...

987
01:19:19,350 --> 01:19:22,436
I hope you don't regret that.

988
01:19:22,603 --> 01:19:27,608
That's... that's... The trying is all.
You know?

989
01:19:28,901 --> 01:19:32,405
If you don't try, if you don't risk...

990
01:19:32,572 --> 01:19:34,699
That's good to know.

991
01:19:37,618 --> 01:19:41,706
I mean, it's... you shouldn't be shy
with this kind of thing,

992
01:19:41,872 --> 01:19:46,252
this... this attraction to someone.

993
01:19:46,419 --> 01:19:48,754
I think attraction is...

994
01:19:48,921 --> 01:19:53,009
It's the animating force
in the universe, really.

995
01:19:54,051 --> 01:19:56,888
-That's a fact.
-Well, like...

996
01:19:58,472 --> 01:20:01,893
Gravity or the pull of the poles,

997
01:20:02,059 --> 01:20:05,730
what pulls
the monarch butterflies...

998
01:20:07,064 --> 01:20:09,442
to fly across the world.

999
01:20:09,609 --> 01:20:13,696
If you feel attracted to someone
from your heart,

1000
01:20:13,863 --> 01:20:19,160
you know... and you look at them and
you feel and you can see their soul...

1001
01:20:20,870 --> 01:20:22,580
That's...

1002
01:20:23,789 --> 01:20:25,791
There is...

1003
01:20:27,001 --> 01:20:31,005
There's no bad version of that,

1004
01:20:31,172 --> 01:20:34,175
to want to be a part of that.

1005
01:20:34,342 --> 01:20:37,595
And we should...

1006
01:20:37,762 --> 01:20:41,891
Oh, God... treasure it.
It's, it's...

1007
01:20:42,058 --> 01:20:44,810
We're lucky to have that feeling.

1008
01:20:44,977 --> 01:20:51,359
It's the greatest, it's the fullest...
expression of what it is to be alive.

1009
01:20:51,525 --> 01:20:53,444
So...

1010
01:20:54,779 --> 01:20:57,323
Do you think you'll, you'll...

1011
01:20:57,490 --> 01:21:01,494
How did it end?
I mean, do you think you'll try again?

1012
01:21:01,661 --> 01:21:03,371
-No.
-No?

1013
01:21:03,537 --> 01:21:06,707
No. No.

1014
01:21:08,376 --> 01:21:12,129
You know, Suze, I am convinced

1015
01:21:12,296 --> 01:21:17,802
she asked me on this trip to find out
what happened to me after my divorce.

1016
01:21:17,969 --> 01:21:23,266
She wants to write about it
as a sequel to her fucking book.

1017
01:21:23,432 --> 01:21:24,934
-I know it.
-No.

1018
01:21:25,101 --> 01:21:27,603
-I know it.
-No. You've got to ask her.

1019
01:21:27,770 --> 01:21:31,023
-No.
-You have to be direct and ask her.

1020
01:21:31,190 --> 01:21:34,777
You know, you heard those things
she said during that talk.

1021
01:21:34,944 --> 01:21:38,823
She uses things
and people from her life.

1022
01:21:38,990 --> 01:21:43,077
-Well, I'm... I'm one of those people.
-I know you are. I know you are.

1023
01:21:43,244 --> 01:21:47,790
But that's what writers do, and she
never meant to hurt you, I promise you.

1024
01:21:47,957 --> 01:21:49,959
-She never meant to hurt you.
-She doesn't care, Susan.

1025
01:21:50,126 --> 01:21:52,962
I think she does care.
She cares about you.

1026
01:21:53,129 --> 01:21:55,423
And why would she be writing
about you again?

1027
01:21:55,590 --> 01:21:58,050
She loves you.
She's obsessed with you.

1028
01:21:58,217 --> 01:22:01,762
She said she uses people
from her life,

1029
01:22:01,929 --> 01:22:04,765
and she is going to use me
in this sequel.

1030
01:22:04,932 --> 01:22:07,310
I don't believe that, dear.
I really don't.

1031
01:22:07,476 --> 01:22:11,314
I know it could seem that way
if you twist it.

1032
01:22:11,480 --> 01:22:14,191
If you twist it the other way,

1033
01:22:14,358 --> 01:22:18,654
you know, she has the same memories
we do of our days together.

1034
01:22:18,821 --> 01:22:20,740
-They're sacred.
-Yeah.

1035
01:22:20,907 --> 01:22:25,161
Maybe not sacred.
That's a little pompous.

1036
01:22:25,328 --> 01:22:28,706
But you know what I mean, what we
were talking about the other day.

1037
01:22:28,873 --> 01:22:32,418
-She has those, too.
-Yeah, but she's very different now.

1038
01:22:32,585 --> 01:22:35,129
I know she is.
She really has changed.

1039
01:22:35,296 --> 01:22:37,298
She's changed so much.

1040
01:22:37,465 --> 01:22:39,675
-Did she always talk like that?
-No.

1041
01:22:39,842 --> 01:22:41,552
-She didn't?
-Did not.

1042
01:22:41,719 --> 01:22:46,057
-I wonder why she talks like that.
-I know.

1043
01:22:56,275 --> 01:23:00,154
Just so you know, she's invited me
to dinner with all of you.

1044
01:23:01,280 --> 01:23:03,574
Oh, fuck.

1045
01:23:03,741 --> 01:23:07,036
Karen's very hopeful about
the publishing business, actually.

1046
01:23:07,203 --> 01:23:12,416
I mean, against all reason, in my
opinion, but if you could talk a little

1047
01:23:12,583 --> 01:23:16,504
about what the agency
is going to do now and in the future.

1048
01:23:16,671 --> 01:23:19,882
The old dead wood
has been moved aside.

1049
01:23:20,049 --> 01:23:21,926
It's been an interesting time.

1050
01:23:22,093 --> 01:23:23,678
There have been quite
a few changes at the agency,

1051
01:23:23,844 --> 01:23:28,224
but I feel very optimistic about what
we're going to be doing going forward.

1052
01:23:28,391 --> 01:23:31,602
And I... We've got
exciting plans for Alice.

1053
01:23:31,769 --> 01:23:35,565
You know, Sonia did tell me that Alice
was quite secretive about her work.

1054
01:23:35,731 --> 01:23:39,777
-But I had no idea how secretive.
-Well, I...

1055
01:23:39,944 --> 01:23:42,154
I mean, I still haven't been able
to deduce

1056
01:23:42,321 --> 01:23:47,159
which of your literary characters
that you are reviving.

1057
01:23:47,326 --> 01:23:49,954
I do hope it's Rowena
from <i>You Always, You Never.</i>

1058
01:23:50,121 --> 01:23:56,210
Yes, I would love to know what Rowena
has been up to the last 35 years.

1059
01:23:56,377 --> 01:23:58,713
Oh, dear, you know...

1060
01:23:58,879 --> 01:24:00,381
Let me just say.

1061
01:24:00,548 --> 01:24:04,218
-On this subject...
-I think everyone cares. Rowena...

1062
01:24:04,385 --> 01:24:06,012
I don't think anybody really cares.

1063
01:24:06,178 --> 01:24:09,724
What became of Rowena
after her disastrous marriage?

1064
01:24:09,891 --> 01:24:13,603
Did she find love again?
Did she get another career?

1065
01:24:13,769 --> 01:24:15,479
Did she have a child?

1066
01:24:15,646 --> 01:24:19,859
Rowena is a beloved literary character.
What, what...

1067
01:24:20,026 --> 01:24:22,153
-She is. She is.
-Bert, Bert.

1068
01:24:22,320 --> 01:24:25,781
What I want to say about this... And...

1069
01:24:25,948 --> 01:24:28,492
I should clarify for you

1070
01:24:28,659 --> 01:24:32,663
that whatever character I write about,
is essentially about me.

1071
01:24:32,830 --> 01:24:35,708
I mean, honestly,
that's what authors do. Don't they?

1072
01:24:35,875 --> 01:24:39,045
-Let me... Just... I don't think...
-And another thing...

1073
01:24:39,211 --> 01:24:45,218
...I have ever been at a table
with two more self-obsessed people.

1074
01:24:45,384 --> 01:24:49,597
I don't think I ever have.
This is a first. This is a first.

1075
01:24:52,099 --> 01:24:55,311
We care for each other. Do we?

1076
01:24:55,478 --> 01:24:58,314
-Do we care for each other?
-Yes, of course.

1077
01:24:58,481 --> 01:25:03,569
Yes. We do care for each other.
This happened in your youth.

1078
01:25:03,736 --> 01:25:07,365
This happened so long...
In your youth.

1079
01:25:07,531 --> 01:25:14,038
And today, this very day,
we have lived most of our lives.

1080
01:25:14,205 --> 01:25:20,378
Right? Are you gonna continue
this ancient battle

1081
01:25:20,544 --> 01:25:24,423
for the little time that remains to us?

1082
01:25:24,590 --> 01:25:27,051
Do you even know
what happened yesterday

1083
01:25:27,218 --> 01:25:30,054
when we were out of communication
with the world?

1084
01:25:30,221 --> 01:25:32,056
Do you know what happened?

1085
01:25:32,223 --> 01:25:34,058
You don't know what happened.
Do you know what happened?

1086
01:25:34,225 --> 01:25:36,269
-Does anyone know what happened?
-I was working, so I wasn't...

1087
01:25:36,435 --> 01:25:38,980
Well, of course you were working.
You're always working.

1088
01:25:39,146 --> 01:25:40,565
Yes.

1089
01:25:41,691 --> 01:25:44,110
Elon Musk...

1090
01:25:45,319 --> 01:25:50,408
sent many, many telecom satellites
into the sky

1091
01:25:51,701 --> 01:25:54,996
that look exactly like stars,

1092
01:25:55,162 --> 01:25:56,664
exactly like stars.

1093
01:25:56,831 --> 01:26:00,876
So now when humans gaze
at the night sky,

1094
01:26:01,043 --> 01:26:06,966
they won't know if they're gazing
at a star or at a machine.

1095
01:26:08,467 --> 01:26:14,098
And we at this table,
at this little table,

1096
01:26:14,265 --> 01:26:19,103
we are among the last, the very last,

1097
01:26:19,270 --> 01:26:21,772
ever, ever,

1098
01:26:21,939 --> 01:26:26,068
to have seen the actual, real,

1099
01:26:26,235 --> 01:26:31,824
the honest, truthful night sky
from the ocean.

1100
01:26:31,991 --> 01:26:35,036
We saw stars...

1101
01:26:35,202 --> 01:26:37,788
Just stars.

1102
01:27:13,366 --> 01:27:17,036
-Are you packed?
-I'm killing it.

1103
01:27:17,203 --> 01:27:21,249
-Yeah? Killing it with the bags?
-No.

1104
01:27:24,794 --> 01:27:27,755
No, my book.

1105
01:27:32,635 --> 01:27:36,639
I deleted it...
from my computer.

1106
01:27:36,806 --> 01:27:39,141
I deleted it all.

1107
01:27:40,726 --> 01:27:44,480
And I threw the hard copy
in the recycling.

1108
01:27:44,647 --> 01:27:46,816
Why?

1109
01:27:46,983 --> 01:27:49,026
It's...

1110
01:27:54,073 --> 01:27:59,036
You know what? It's like polishing
the vase when the house is falling down.

1111
01:28:05,167 --> 01:28:07,628
You don't know.

1112
01:28:07,795 --> 01:28:09,755
You don't know
what I'm talking about.

1113
01:28:11,340 --> 01:28:14,135
Anyway, I'm gonna...

1114
01:28:14,302 --> 01:28:18,639
ask you to bring the bigger bags
down for me, okay?

1115
01:30:40,573 --> 01:30:44,201
I think the words matter.
I do think they matter.

1116
01:30:45,244 --> 01:30:50,625
Which ones you choose to describe
something or to express something.

1117
01:30:50,791 --> 01:30:55,504
It takes time to worry those
into existence,

1118
01:30:55,671 --> 01:30:59,884
the right one, the right one.
There's only one that's right.

1119
01:31:01,886 --> 01:31:05,932
I lament... You know, sometimes I wait,
I wait for a word to come to me.

1120
01:31:06,098 --> 01:31:09,143
I wait... I'll wait a week.

1121
01:31:09,310 --> 01:31:12,772
No, but it amused me on the ship

1122
01:31:12,939 --> 01:31:18,653
how they were so eager that we not use
the word "boat" to describe the ship

1123
01:31:18,819 --> 01:31:22,615
because "boat" is
sort of a diminutive...

1124
01:31:22,782 --> 01:31:26,661
Or when they would say
don't call it "a cruise."

1125
01:31:26,827 --> 01:31:29,956
It's not a cruise. It's a crossing.

1126
01:31:34,001 --> 01:31:39,590
And it is a crossing. You're crossing
time zones. You feel them.

1127
01:31:39,757 --> 01:31:43,928
-Yes, you do.
-Crossing into something unknown.

1128
01:31:44,095 --> 01:31:48,099
I mean, it's... The cruise
just seems meandering and...

1129
01:31:48,266 --> 01:31:50,059
And silly.

1130
01:31:53,854 --> 01:31:55,523
Alice...

1131
01:31:56,649 --> 01:31:59,944
What I'm trying to reconcile is

1132
01:32:00,111 --> 01:32:03,281
who is the real you?

1133
01:32:05,491 --> 01:32:08,286
I just...

1134
01:32:09,412 --> 01:32:12,540
I just don't know
who you are anymore.

1135
01:32:12,707 --> 01:32:16,961
I mean, does...
Does anybody trust you anymore?

1136
01:32:17,128 --> 01:32:20,298
And is that hard for you? I mean...

1137
01:32:20,464 --> 01:32:24,093
Are you okay with that?
You seem to be okay with that.

1138
01:32:26,178 --> 01:32:30,600
What do you mean?
Because I write from my life and from...

1139
01:32:30,766 --> 01:32:34,604
Oh, yeah, you write from your life,
but you write from others,

1140
01:32:34,770 --> 01:32:41,319
and those others experience it
as a kind of betrayal.

1141
01:32:42,361 --> 01:32:45,197
-You obviously...
-Well, you know, you...

1142
01:32:46,616 --> 01:32:48,492
Betrayal.

1143
01:32:48,659 --> 01:32:54,540
I think that you perhaps betray
the people that you love the most...

1144
01:32:54,707 --> 01:33:00,087
Because you know that you have
the expectation of forgiveness.

1145
01:33:00,254 --> 01:33:03,049
The people that you don't know
very well,

1146
01:33:03,215 --> 01:33:05,843
trying to seduce or impress,

1147
01:33:06,010 --> 01:33:09,889
you treat them much more tenderly.
That's my experience.

1148
01:33:10,056 --> 01:33:13,976
But it's harder to forgive

1149
01:33:14,143 --> 01:33:18,105
when you're wallowing

1150
01:33:18,272 --> 01:33:21,609
in the middle of the debris
of what your life used to be.

1151
01:33:22,693 --> 01:33:27,698
It requires a greater expanse of spirit

1152
01:33:27,865 --> 01:33:31,452
than I think most people have.

1153
01:33:31,619 --> 01:33:35,831
Did you come on this trip to, to...

1154
01:33:38,876 --> 01:33:43,256
berate me or to forgive me or to...

1155
01:33:45,216 --> 01:33:47,593
extract something else?

1156
01:33:47,760 --> 01:33:49,929
An apology or...

1157
01:33:50,096 --> 01:33:55,560
to reconnect, maybe, our friendship?

1158
01:33:55,726 --> 01:33:59,021
Why did you say yes?

1159
01:34:01,941 --> 01:34:04,902
I wanted an apology.

1160
01:34:05,069 --> 01:34:09,782
I wanted you to at least acknowledge

1161
01:34:09,949 --> 01:34:12,618
the damage that you caused in my life.

1162
01:34:16,247 --> 01:34:18,749
And...

1163
01:34:18,916 --> 01:34:22,878
And I wanted to extract...

1164
01:34:25,047 --> 01:34:28,092
a little compensation for it.

1165
01:34:31,679 --> 01:34:37,602
Because if you
were going to write a sequel,

1166
01:34:38,895 --> 01:34:43,691
I would tell you everything
about the last 35 years.

1167
01:34:43,858 --> 01:34:48,154
I would give you all the sordid,
squalid details.

1168
01:34:48,321 --> 01:34:50,781
You would have...

1169
01:34:50,948 --> 01:34:54,911
You would have a great book.

1170
01:34:55,077 --> 01:34:57,580
And all I want...

1171
01:34:59,123 --> 01:35:01,792
is 30% of the profits.

1172
01:35:01,959 --> 01:35:06,756
Wait. What did you...
What did you just say?

1173
01:35:06,923 --> 01:35:10,009
Well, I think you heard me.

1174
01:35:10,176 --> 01:35:13,054
And I think it's fair.

1175
01:35:15,223 --> 01:35:17,600
Oh, my God.

1176
01:35:21,270 --> 01:35:24,106
Oh, my God. I just...

1177
01:35:26,567 --> 01:35:30,988
I realize what this is about.
This is not about...

1178
01:35:31,155 --> 01:35:34,492
This is not about love.
This is about money.

1179
01:35:34,659 --> 01:35:37,954
I'm so sorry. I didn't realize that.

1180
01:35:40,581 --> 01:35:42,833
I'll give you a check.

1181
01:35:49,298 --> 01:35:53,094
-We really lost each other, you know?
-Yeah, we did.

1182
01:35:55,763 --> 01:35:58,724
I loved you when you were Al.

1183
01:36:09,360 --> 01:36:12,321
Well, I'll see you tomorrow.

1184
01:38:02,765 --> 01:38:05,184
-Excuse me, Tyler...
-Hey.

1185
01:38:05,351 --> 01:38:09,397
I'm Dr. Mitchell. I'm Alice's physician.
Come in, please.

1186
01:38:09,564 --> 01:38:13,150
What's happening? Is she sleeping?

1187
01:38:13,317 --> 01:38:16,612
I'm very sorry to inform you,

1188
01:38:16,779 --> 01:38:21,117
but your aunt passed away
in the middle of the night.

1189
01:38:21,284 --> 01:38:23,578
Oh, no.

1190
01:38:24,662 --> 01:38:28,624
-Alice had a serious condition called...
-Fuck.

1191
01:38:28,791 --> 01:38:32,003
...deep vein thrombosis,
and it's a blood clot

1192
01:38:32,169 --> 01:38:36,048
which can travel up to the lungs,
the heart, or the brain.

1193
01:38:36,215 --> 01:38:40,803
Right now we're not sure which
until we get a coroner's report.

1194
01:38:40,970 --> 01:38:43,222
I'm very sorry.

1195
01:38:44,891 --> 01:38:49,478
The coroner as well as the police
are headed here.

1196
01:38:49,645 --> 01:38:52,940
If you'd like some time
to spend with her before they get here.

1197
01:38:53,107 --> 01:38:56,193
-Yeah. That would be great.
-Okay, I'll be right outside.

1198
01:38:56,360 --> 01:38:58,029
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

1199
01:38:58,195 --> 01:39:00,072
Yeah.

1200
01:39:41,113 --> 01:39:44,951
She had told me of her
wanting to go to England

1201
01:39:45,117 --> 01:39:48,120
to pick up the Footling Prize,

1202
01:39:48,287 --> 01:39:50,957
see Blodwyn Pugh's gravesite,

1203
01:39:51,123 --> 01:39:54,710
and also discuss her
at the awards ceremony.

1204
01:39:54,877 --> 01:39:58,339
She had at one point intended to fly.

1205
01:39:58,506 --> 01:40:02,593
I certainly said that that would not be
a good idea to travel by plane.

1206
01:40:02,760 --> 01:40:04,512
It wouldn't be a good idea
to travel at all.

1207
01:40:04,679 --> 01:40:06,973
I strongly advised her
to stay in New York,

1208
01:40:07,139 --> 01:40:11,435
but as you all know, Alice is Alice.

1209
01:40:11,602 --> 01:40:16,440
And she's very strong-willed,
and, ultimately, she wanted to go.

1210
01:40:16,607 --> 01:40:20,736
So, I then discussed with her perhaps
I should come along with her

1211
01:40:20,903 --> 01:40:22,863
to help her with the medication.

1212
01:40:23,030 --> 01:40:26,117
The medication that we typically use
in this situation is a blood thinner,

1213
01:40:26,284 --> 01:40:28,494
but it needed to be injected.

1214
01:40:28,661 --> 01:40:31,289
I would give the injections
in the morning and in the evening.

1215
01:40:31,455 --> 01:40:35,668
Could I just interrupt to ask
if it could have been brought on

1216
01:40:35,835 --> 01:40:39,422
by an emotional discussion,

1217
01:40:39,589 --> 01:40:43,259
an emotional encounter?

1218
01:40:43,426 --> 01:40:49,181
Most likely not. These things are,
as I said, unpredictable in nature,

1219
01:40:49,348 --> 01:40:52,727
and they can happen
and it doesn't have anything to do

1220
01:40:52,894 --> 01:40:55,980
with what's going on
in someone's personal life.

1221
01:40:56,147 --> 01:40:57,565
So, no.

1222
01:41:03,988 --> 01:41:08,034
Shall I go rebook our flights now?

1223
01:41:08,200 --> 01:41:11,662
-Oh, my goodness sake.
<i>-Well...</i>

1224
01:41:11,829 --> 01:41:14,081
-We've got to...
-To when?

1225
01:41:14,248 --> 01:41:17,209
-Tomorrow?
-Maybe the next day.

1226
01:41:17,376 --> 01:41:22,214
We've got to pack Alice's stuff
and then pack all our stuff.

1227
01:41:24,717 --> 01:41:27,887
I don't know.
I was... I was sort of...

1228
01:41:28,054 --> 01:41:31,807
It doesn't feel right to me to leave

1229
01:41:31,974 --> 01:41:35,937
or to book the flight right now.
I feel like we got to...

1230
01:41:36,103 --> 01:41:38,648
The trip isn't over. Like, the...

1231
01:41:38,814 --> 01:41:44,153
We should visit Blodwyn's grave,
like Alice wanted us to.

1232
01:41:45,238 --> 01:41:49,075
She brought us here. She chose us.

1233
01:41:49,242 --> 01:41:51,827
The three... Just us three.

1234
01:41:51,994 --> 01:41:56,123
Personally, for me, I... My life...

1235
01:41:57,333 --> 01:42:03,673
I... Everything that's good in my life
feels related to Alice in so many ways.

1236
01:42:03,839 --> 01:42:08,302
I've been so ashamed
of the family that I come from,

1237
01:42:08,469 --> 01:42:12,098
for so long, until I met Alice.

1238
01:42:13,599 --> 01:42:16,018
And...

1239
01:42:16,185 --> 01:42:21,232
I can't leave here without going
to that gravesite. I'm just...

1240
01:42:21,399 --> 01:42:24,569
It would feel like...
It would make me sick.

1241
01:43:41,979 --> 01:43:45,399
Does anybody want to say anything?

1242
01:43:45,566 --> 01:43:48,236
Tyler, I don't even know the woman.

1243
01:43:48,402 --> 01:43:51,322
I don't even like her writing.

1244
01:43:52,907 --> 01:43:55,660
This is for Alice.

1245
01:44:07,046 --> 01:44:09,298
I guess we should go, then.

1246
01:44:13,094 --> 01:44:14,762
I need a drink.

1247
01:44:32,321 --> 01:44:35,533
Isn't there an editor
or a fellow writer,

1248
01:44:35,700 --> 01:44:38,077
someone who could do
something with it?

1249
01:44:38,244 --> 01:44:40,037
<i>Honestly, it's...</i>

1250
01:44:40,204 --> 01:44:43,291
I don't know what it is
or what could be done with it.

1251
01:44:43,457 --> 01:44:46,460
I guess you could call it
experimental.

1252
01:44:46,627 --> 01:44:50,673
We could post it online
and charge people to read it.

1253
01:44:50,840 --> 01:44:54,886
I personally wouldn't feel
comfortable doing that.

1254
01:44:55,052 --> 01:44:59,432
Look, whatever this is, it's clearly
in a very embryonic stage,

1255
01:44:59,599 --> 01:45:01,601
and it's not meant to be published.

1256
01:45:01,767 --> 01:45:04,270
She was trying something out,
and she didn't get to see it through.

1257
01:45:04,437 --> 01:45:06,981
<i>Yeah, but people</i>
<i>might find that interesting.</i>

1258
01:45:07,148 --> 01:45:10,902
Her readers, literary scholars.

1259
01:45:11,068 --> 01:45:14,322
Look, maybe someone else
can help you.

1260
01:45:14,488 --> 01:45:17,783
You said she gave it to you.
You can take it wherever you want.

1261
01:45:17,950 --> 01:45:20,703
<i>You don't need me, not for that.</i>

1262
01:45:20,870 --> 01:45:25,291
-Roberta, we need you on the floor.
-Yeah, I'm coming, Clovis.

1263
01:45:25,458 --> 01:45:29,378
I'll be right there. I'm coming.

1264
01:45:29,545 --> 01:45:32,632
-Yeah, Mom...
<i>-Should I send it back to you?</i>

1265
01:45:32,798 --> 01:45:35,301
I'm coming. What?

1266
01:45:35,468 --> 01:45:38,512
No, no, no. Keep it.

1267
01:45:38,679 --> 01:45:41,432
Give it to Tyler.

1268
01:45:41,599 --> 01:45:46,437
How about... how about this?
How about a sequel?

1269
01:45:46,604 --> 01:45:50,191
A sequel with real people,
real people's names,

1270
01:45:50,358 --> 01:45:53,903
<i>places, about what happened</i>
<i>in my life</i>

1271
01:45:54,070 --> 01:45:57,823
<i>after the publication</i>
of You Always, You Never?

1272
01:45:57,990 --> 01:46:00,076
<i>How about that?</i>

1273
01:46:00,243 --> 01:46:04,121
Roberta, if you were ever
to write that book,

1274
01:46:04,288 --> 01:46:06,123
I'd love to see it.

1275
01:46:06,290 --> 01:46:10,461
I just don't understand
the whole agent thing,

1276
01:46:10,628 --> 01:46:13,089
but I spoke to Karen

1277
01:46:13,256 --> 01:46:16,717
and she said that, because
she represents you now,

1278
01:46:16,884 --> 01:46:18,719
she couldn't represent me.

1279
01:46:18,886 --> 01:46:20,888
-No, no, no, no.
-Yeah.

1280
01:46:21,055 --> 01:46:23,558
-Okay, but she can find you an--
-It's a conflict.

1281
01:46:23,724 --> 01:46:27,895
Okay, but she can find you
an agent and a lawyer, but...

1282
01:46:28,062 --> 01:46:31,691
You should use my old agent. That's
perfect. He'd love to represent you.

1283
01:46:31,857 --> 01:46:33,985
-Okay.
-He should be so lucky.

1284
01:46:34,151 --> 01:46:37,113
Because the deal's 50-50.
We're just gonna split it 50-50, right?

1285
01:46:37,280 --> 01:46:39,490
-That doesn't make any sense at all.
-Why?

1286
01:46:39,657 --> 01:46:43,661
-You are the writer. It's not 50-50.
-Well, yes, it is.

1287
01:46:43,828 --> 01:46:45,913
I mean, unless you want more.
I mean...

1288
01:46:46,080 --> 01:46:48,791
-Don't be absurd.
-You don't need an agent.

1289
01:46:50,334 --> 01:46:54,880
You're better than your agent.
Look, I am so happy to be doing this.

1290
01:46:55,047 --> 01:46:59,468
This is my idea.
We're splitting it 50-50. That's done.

1291
01:46:59,635 --> 01:47:02,471
Forget it.
Let's just move on and try to start.

1292
01:47:02,638 --> 01:47:05,641
-Do you have some--
-This might be interesting.

1293
01:47:05,808 --> 01:47:12,064
But it turns out the main ingredient
in antifreeze is ethylene glycol.

1294
01:47:12,231 --> 01:47:15,067
-In antifreeze?
-In antifreeze. Wait, now...

1295
01:47:15,234 --> 01:47:19,989
Which is not only incredibly toxic
but also very sweet.

1296
01:47:21,240 --> 01:47:26,203
So that, people, when they want
to poison someone, have used it a lot.

1297
01:47:26,370 --> 01:47:31,626
And now 17 states require
the manufacturer

1298
01:47:31,792 --> 01:47:35,129
to add something
to make it taste very bitter.

1299
01:47:36,422 --> 01:47:39,008
Which leaves 33 states
where they don't.

1300
01:47:39,175 --> 01:47:40,551
-Exactly.
-If my math...

1301
01:47:40,718 --> 01:47:43,804
So I was thinking maybe
as part of her plan,

1302
01:47:43,971 --> 01:47:47,600
she either lives in a state
that doesn't have the law...

1303
01:47:47,767 --> 01:47:50,436
-Or moves to one.
-And then moves to one.

1304
01:47:50,603 --> 01:47:53,022
And then moves to one.

1305

<i>When I read this novel,</i>

1306
01:49:25,865 --> 01:49:29,076
<i>it's... it's impossible for me</i>

1307
01:49:29,243 --> 01:49:33,623
<i>not to think what a miracle it is</i>
<i>that this universe emerged,</i>

1308
01:49:33,789 --> 01:49:39,921
<i>what a miracle it is</i>
<i>that consciousness emerged...</i>

1309
01:49:40,796 --> 01:49:44,550
<i>And what a miracle it is</i>
<i>that Blodwyn Pugh,</i>

1310
01:49:44,717 --> 01:49:47,720
<i>her thoughts and experiences,</i>

1311
01:49:47,887 --> 01:49:52,350
<i>that they could reach across time</i>

1312
01:49:52,516 --> 01:49:56,604
<i>and reach into my consciousness.</i>

1313
01:49:57,563 --> 01:49:58,940
<i>That's a miracle.</i>
