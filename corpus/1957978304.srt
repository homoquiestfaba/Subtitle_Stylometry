00:01:01,148 --> 00:01:02,584
[boat engine idles]

2
00:01:07,676 --> 00:01:09,591
All right.
Well, the water looks good.

3
00:01:09,678 --> 00:01:10,679
I think we're all set.

4
00:01:10,766 --> 00:01:12,159
It hasn't rained in a while,

5
00:01:12,246 --> 00:01:13,595
so there should
be maximum visibility.

6
00:01:29,828 --> 00:01:30,829
Just follow my lead.

7
00:01:30,916 --> 00:01:32,527
Yeah, right.

8
00:01:32,614 --> 00:01:33,441
I'm not the one who wanted
to quit early last time.

9
00:01:33,528 --> 00:01:35,660
You follow my lead.

10
00:01:35,747 --> 00:01:38,185
Oh, I see how it is.

11
00:01:38,272 --> 00:01:40,187
First person out of the water
buys drinks tonight.

12
00:01:40,274 --> 00:01:41,144
Oh, you are on.

13
00:01:41,231 --> 00:01:43,364
[splashes]

14
00:01:58,727 --> 00:02:00,555
Got you!

15
00:02:01,686 --> 00:02:03,210
Just dive, you goofball.

16
00:03:19,286 --> 00:03:20,417
[shrieking]

17
00:03:30,514 --> 00:03:33,952
Mike! Mike!

18
00:03:41,917 --> 00:03:43,658
[muffled shouting]

19
00:03:49,446 --> 00:03:51,274
Ah!

20
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,673
[shrieks]

21
00:04:19,389 --> 00:04:20,695
Are you sure this
is the right pier?

22
00:04:20,782 --> 00:04:23,219
That's what the directions said.

23
00:04:23,306 --> 00:04:24,742
Do you have all your gear?

24
00:04:24,829 --> 00:04:27,397
Yes, Dad. I double checked
this morning.

25
00:04:27,484 --> 00:04:29,443
All right, let's go.

26
00:04:34,839 --> 00:04:36,972
It's supposed to be
around here somewhere.

27
00:04:37,059 --> 00:04:39,366
With a name like the Jubilation,

28
00:04:39,453 --> 00:04:41,150
it shouldn't be
that hard to find.

29
00:04:41,237 --> 00:04:43,761
Well, you could just starting
screaming, "Jubilation!

30
00:04:43,848 --> 00:04:44,849
Jubilation!"

31
00:04:44,936 --> 00:04:46,634
That should get their attention.

32
00:04:46,721 --> 00:04:47,722
I don't know if that's the
attention I want, Dad.

33
00:04:50,725 --> 00:04:52,683
You know, I really wish you
were coming on this one with me.

34
00:04:52,770 --> 00:04:55,382
One of my sea legs is faulty.

35
00:04:55,469 --> 00:04:58,863
But as soon as I get my bum leg
out of this stinky cast,

36
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:01,649
we'll hit
the high seas again, okay?

37
00:05:03,651 --> 00:05:05,000
On this one, you need to scout

38
00:05:05,087 --> 00:05:08,003
this new charter boat
and the captain.

39
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:10,222
Make sure they are
both up to snuff, okay?

40
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:12,399
Sir, yes, sir.

41
00:05:12,486 --> 00:05:14,052
On a very important
scouting mission.

42
00:05:14,139 --> 00:05:16,490
What's the name
of this captain again? Banning?

43
00:05:16,577 --> 00:05:18,318
Captain Banning.

44
00:05:18,405 --> 00:05:21,016
And remember, be respectful
of her and her boat, okay,

45
00:05:21,103 --> 00:05:23,714
just like Papi taught you.

46
00:05:25,107 --> 00:05:28,502
Hey, can you slow down
just a little bit?

47
00:05:28,589 --> 00:05:29,633
They won't
leave without you, I promise.

48
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,679
I paid a lot for this charter.

49
00:05:32,897 --> 00:05:33,942
Are you okay?

50
00:05:38,903 --> 00:05:40,078
Si.

51
00:05:40,165 --> 00:05:41,863
I just wanted to show you this.

52
00:05:44,779 --> 00:05:46,694
You did not bring this picture!

53
00:05:46,781 --> 00:05:50,045
I did bring this picture.

54
00:05:50,132 --> 00:05:51,829
It's so embarrassing.

55
00:05:51,916 --> 00:05:53,614
You know, I'm glad you're
not coming on this trip.

56
00:05:53,701 --> 00:05:55,267
- You're way too embarrassing.
- You take that back!

57
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:58,488
Okay, fine. I wish you were
coming on this trip.

58
00:05:58,575 --> 00:05:59,794
But enough with
the picture already.

59
00:05:59,881 --> 00:06:01,012
I love this picture!
Look at you.

60
00:06:01,099 --> 00:06:02,623
So determined.

61
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:04,581
Eight years old, out
in the pouring rain

62
00:06:04,668 --> 00:06:07,367
at the break of dawn
tossing that reel over and over

63
00:06:07,454 --> 00:06:09,717
again trying to nab
the big one, huh?

64
00:06:09,804 --> 00:06:11,632
Just like Papi?

65
00:06:11,719 --> 00:06:14,939
Yeah, well, I hope I get to reel
in some big yellowfin soon.

66
00:06:16,114 --> 00:06:18,029
Oh, wait.

67
00:06:18,116 --> 00:06:19,814
I think I see it.

68
00:06:21,642 --> 00:06:26,734
Yeah, that's it, the Jubilation.

69
00:06:26,821 --> 00:06:28,779
Kind of looks like an old boat.

70
00:06:28,866 --> 00:06:29,998
Uh-huh.

71
00:06:31,739 --> 00:06:33,567
So you want me
to walk you out on the boat?

72
00:06:33,654 --> 00:06:35,873
No, Dad. I'm a big girl.

73
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:37,397
I think I can handle
this on my own.

74
00:06:37,484 --> 00:06:38,920
Okay, good.

75
00:06:39,007 --> 00:06:40,487
'Cause I don't think this cast

76
00:06:40,574 --> 00:06:41,923
will make it out
on that rickety dock.

77
00:06:44,752 --> 00:06:46,101
Dad...

78
00:06:48,233 --> 00:06:51,846
Okay, remember, be respectful of
the captain and her boat, okay?

79
00:06:51,933 --> 00:06:55,110
Oh, and if you need
any tips, you call me?

80
00:06:55,197 --> 00:06:56,677
- Yeah.
- Okay.

81
00:06:56,764 --> 00:06:58,940
Oh, and photos.
Take lots of photos.

82
00:06:59,027 --> 00:07:00,028
Okay, lot of pics,
yeah, okay, I got it.

83
00:07:00,115 --> 00:07:01,725
I gotta go. I'm late.

84
00:07:01,812 --> 00:07:03,988
- Bye, I love you.
- Okay. I love you too, Lucia.

85
00:07:09,951 --> 00:07:11,169
My little angler.

86
00:07:13,084 --> 00:07:14,869
Okay, then.

87
00:07:22,964 --> 00:07:25,445
Captain Banning?

88
00:07:25,532 --> 00:07:27,621
Yep, that's me.

89
00:07:27,708 --> 00:07:29,753
Oh, I thought...

90
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,799
You thought you'd
see a woman, right?

91
00:07:31,886 --> 00:07:35,672
N-n-no, I didn't think...

92
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:38,458
I wanna captain
my own boat one day.

93
00:07:38,545 --> 00:07:39,894
My dad just...

94
00:07:39,981 --> 00:07:41,896
It's okay, it's okay.

95
00:07:41,983 --> 00:07:44,115
I guess with a name like
Shelly you can't help it.

96
00:07:44,202 --> 00:07:47,510
People see the paperwork before
they get here all the time,

97
00:07:47,597 --> 00:07:50,078
they think they're gonna
see some old salty sea hag.

98
00:07:50,165 --> 00:07:53,603
Then they see me and you have
that same look on your face

99
00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:58,652
that you have when they see
this salty old sea dog instead.

100
00:07:58,739 --> 00:08:00,567
You must be Lucia.

101
00:08:00,654 --> 00:08:02,133
That's me.

102
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:03,874
Jump on aboard, Lucia.

103
00:08:03,961 --> 00:08:05,528
Thanks.

104
00:08:05,615 --> 00:08:07,922
I'm looking forward to
catching some yellowfins.

105
00:08:08,009 --> 00:08:09,532
My dad and I, we caught some

106
00:08:09,619 --> 00:08:11,186
a few years back up north
in San Diego.

107
00:08:11,273 --> 00:08:13,884
Yeah. Fish is good up there,

108
00:08:13,971 --> 00:08:16,844
especially this time of the
year, but we have bigger ones.

109
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:22,806
Your fellow anglers
have arrived.

110
00:08:22,893 --> 00:08:24,591
Oh, I can't wait
to get out there, D.

111
00:08:24,678 --> 00:08:26,854
I haven't gone fishing in
I don't know how long.

112
00:08:26,941 --> 00:08:28,986
And the horseback riding
on the beach tomorrow...

113
00:08:29,073 --> 00:08:31,511
one for the bucket list.

114
00:08:31,598 --> 00:08:32,903
And today I get to take off

115
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:34,601
deep sea fishing
off my bucket list.

116
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:38,039
Me too.

117
00:08:38,126 --> 00:08:40,215
Who knows?
Maybe I'm secretly an expert.

118
00:08:40,302 --> 00:08:43,914
Well, there's
only way to find out.

119
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:52,662
Hey, I'm Wyatt.
This is my fiancé, Donna.

120
00:08:52,749 --> 00:08:54,925
Hi.

121
00:08:55,012 --> 00:08:56,013
This is Lucia.

122
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:57,580
Hey.

123
00:08:57,667 --> 00:08:59,060
And I'm your captain
for the day.

124
00:08:59,147 --> 00:09:00,714
Call me Banning,
Captain Banning,

125
00:09:00,801 --> 00:09:01,802
whatever you want.

126
00:09:01,889 --> 00:09:03,455
Just don't call me Shelly.

127
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:05,240
[laughing]

128
00:09:05,327 --> 00:09:08,722
Got the new radio, Captain.

129
00:09:08,809 --> 00:09:10,898
And this here's Shatto.

130
00:09:10,985 --> 00:09:13,770
He really doesn't talk much.

131
00:09:13,857 --> 00:09:15,250
He talks enough for both of us.

132
00:09:17,339 --> 00:09:19,210
Shatto's my first mate.

133
00:09:19,297 --> 00:09:21,038
You been mate
for how long, Shatto?

134
00:09:21,125 --> 00:09:22,605
Uh, too long.

135
00:09:24,999 --> 00:09:27,436
Too long, yep.
That's about right.

136
00:09:27,523 --> 00:09:29,656
We got a few life vests for you.

137
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:34,791
Do we have to wear these?

138
00:09:34,878 --> 00:09:36,880
I'm just concerned... I'm really
trying to get like a tan.

139
00:09:36,967 --> 00:09:38,795
And I don't want to mess
up a tan line, you know.

140
00:09:38,882 --> 00:09:41,493
Uh, if you're
on this ship, you do.

141
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:42,886
It's regulations.

142
00:09:42,973 --> 00:09:45,106
No exceptions, no excuses.

143
00:09:45,193 --> 00:09:46,934
You can probably
take it off later on

144
00:09:47,021 --> 00:09:48,283
when we get past
the Coast Guard.

145
00:09:50,024 --> 00:09:51,895
I can make this work.

146
00:09:51,982 --> 00:09:53,984
We're gonna have to
make helmets work tomorrow

147
00:09:54,071 --> 00:09:54,985
for horseback riding.

148
00:09:55,072 --> 00:09:57,771
I guess you're right, D.

149
00:09:57,858 --> 00:09:59,642
So there's a little something

150
00:09:59,729 --> 00:10:02,863
that I like to do
before we go on a voyage.

151
00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:06,344
Not that I believe in luck, but
it's supposed to bring us some.

152
00:10:08,216 --> 00:10:09,957
So here goes.

153
00:10:10,044 --> 00:10:11,741
It's a fisherman's poem.

154
00:10:13,830 --> 00:10:17,094
"Give me luck to
catch a fish so big

155
00:10:17,181 --> 00:10:20,750
"so that even I, when
talking about it afterwards,

156
00:10:20,837 --> 00:10:22,360
may not ever have to lie."

157
00:10:27,757 --> 00:10:29,890
Shatto, let's get this
"before" pic out the way.

158
00:10:29,977 --> 00:10:32,588
And maybe the "after" pic,

159
00:10:32,675 --> 00:10:35,199
the boat will be filled with
fish bigger than your dreams.

160
00:10:35,286 --> 00:10:36,592
- [chuckles]
- Yeah.

161
00:10:36,679 --> 00:10:38,159
Hey, my dad used
to have a camera

162
00:10:38,246 --> 00:10:39,856
like that when I was a kid.

163
00:10:39,943 --> 00:10:43,730
You hear that, Shatto?
We're older than dirt.

164
00:10:44,992 --> 00:10:47,429
Come on.
Huddle up together, y'all.

165
00:10:49,866 --> 00:10:51,999
- Say "feesh"!
- Feesh!

166
00:11:08,798 --> 00:11:10,234
Hey, you know, my pop taught me

167
00:11:10,321 --> 00:11:11,888
how to drive a boat like
this when I was a kid.

168
00:11:11,975 --> 00:11:13,760
- Oh, is that right?
- Yeah.

169
00:11:13,847 --> 00:11:15,892
What do you think about me
taking it for a joy ride

170
00:11:15,979 --> 00:11:17,677
once we're on the open water?

171
00:11:17,764 --> 00:11:18,765
[laughs]

172
00:11:18,852 --> 00:11:21,071
Not on your life, kid.

173
00:11:21,158 --> 00:11:25,249
Besides, you're gonna be too
busy pulling in a lot of fish.

174
00:11:25,336 --> 00:11:26,903
So you won't be able
to steer this vessel.

175
00:11:28,339 --> 00:11:29,427
Worth a shot.

176
00:11:30,951 --> 00:11:32,779
Now you all have your
licenses intact,

177
00:11:32,866 --> 00:11:34,084
which means you're gonna be on

178
00:11:34,171 --> 00:11:36,304
the Jubilation for
like five hours.

179
00:11:36,391 --> 00:11:40,047
Now the Jubilation
may not look like much,

180
00:11:40,134 --> 00:11:44,704
but she's a tough old broad,
kind of like my ex-wife.

181
00:11:44,791 --> 00:11:47,707
Now I won her
in a high-stakes poker game

182
00:11:47,794 --> 00:11:51,188
in Chicago playing against
a Lake Michigan pirate.

183
00:11:51,275 --> 00:11:54,061
He could barely hold his hand.

184
00:11:54,148 --> 00:11:59,283
So I skunked him and he followed
me all throughout Lake Michigan,

185
00:11:59,370 --> 00:12:03,984
Erie and Superior
trying to get his boat back.

186
00:12:04,071 --> 00:12:05,681
So I had to come all the way
to Cabo

187
00:12:05,768 --> 00:12:07,248
just to get him off my tail.

188
00:12:07,335 --> 00:12:09,250
True story.

189
00:12:09,337 --> 00:12:11,426
We're gonna go out
a little bit further.

190
00:12:11,513 --> 00:12:15,560
You can blame it on
global warming, the Illuminati,

191
00:12:15,647 --> 00:12:17,867
Big Foot, I don't care.

192
00:12:17,954 --> 00:12:22,742
It's just that fishing's
been a little light this season,

193
00:12:22,829 --> 00:12:24,308
but I know a place.

194
00:12:24,395 --> 00:12:27,224
We go out further where
you're gonna catch

195
00:12:27,311 --> 00:12:30,924
a certain amount of
divine yellowfish tuna

196
00:12:31,011 --> 00:12:32,839
that you've ever seen.

197
00:12:32,926 --> 00:12:37,060
So just sit your butts
in your seat and enjoy the ride.

198
00:13:17,884 --> 00:13:19,276
He's a character.

199
00:13:19,363 --> 00:13:20,364
That he is, bro.

200
00:13:21,539 --> 00:13:23,890
How long you been
doing this for?

201
00:13:23,977 --> 00:13:26,240
A few years.

202
00:13:26,327 --> 00:13:30,113
Captain took me in when I was
caught up in some bad stuff.

203
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:33,987
Taught me everything I need
to know about this boat.

204
00:13:34,074 --> 00:13:35,858
Gave me some purpose, you know.

205
00:13:37,904 --> 00:13:38,948
He knows what
he's doing, though.

206
00:13:41,255 --> 00:13:42,996
That story about
him winning the boat

207
00:13:43,083 --> 00:13:45,737
in a poker game, is that true?

208
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:49,045
No clue, and I've asked.

209
00:13:49,132 --> 00:13:51,221
I can never get a
straight answer out of him.

210
00:13:53,006 --> 00:13:55,530
Details change from one
charter to the next, though.

211
00:13:55,617 --> 00:13:58,272
[engine revs]

212
00:14:05,932 --> 00:14:07,411
You know, you really
shouldn't text on a boat.

213
00:14:09,109 --> 00:14:10,153
It'll make you puke.

214
00:14:12,547 --> 00:14:14,201
Not me.

215
00:14:14,288 --> 00:14:16,856
I've never gotten seasick once.

216
00:14:16,943 --> 00:14:19,162
Lucky you.

217
00:14:19,249 --> 00:14:20,381
Texting your boyfriend?

218
00:14:22,339 --> 00:14:24,037
My dad.

219
00:14:24,124 --> 00:14:25,255
He worries.

220
00:14:25,342 --> 00:14:27,083
Only child?

221
00:14:27,170 --> 00:14:28,302
Yeah.

222
00:14:28,389 --> 00:14:30,043
Me too.

223
00:14:30,130 --> 00:14:33,089
Sometimes
you love the smothering.

224
00:14:33,176 --> 00:14:36,310
Sometimes the smothering
is just so... smothering.

225
00:14:36,397 --> 00:14:38,094
Yeah, sometimes.

226
00:14:40,009 --> 00:14:41,663
It's just been him
and I for so long.

227
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:45,449
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that,
but I know the feeling.

228
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:48,975
I'm lucky to have found Wyatt.

229
00:14:49,062 --> 00:14:50,890
He has four brothers.

230
00:14:50,977 --> 00:14:53,588
Family gatherings will
never be boring again.

231
00:14:55,982 --> 00:14:57,244
That's beautiful.

232
00:14:57,331 --> 00:14:59,202
Oh, thank you.

233
00:14:59,289 --> 00:15:02,162
Yeah, he's got good taste.

234
00:15:02,249 --> 00:15:03,946
Think I'll keep him.

235
00:15:05,165 --> 00:15:06,906
It seems like he
really loves you.

236
00:15:06,993 --> 00:15:09,517
Like I said,
he's got good taste.

237
00:15:29,276 --> 00:15:30,668
Woo-hoo!

238
00:15:41,201 --> 00:15:42,854
This is it, y'all!

239
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:47,468
Water's a bit choppy,
but this is my secret spot.

240
00:15:47,555 --> 00:15:49,209
You can't see it right now,

241
00:15:49,296 --> 00:15:53,953
but you look right over there,
that's a sandbar.

242
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:55,955
Kinda acts as a barrier,

243
00:15:56,042 --> 00:16:00,437
sort of funnels
the bigger fish this way.

244
00:16:00,524 --> 00:16:03,527
Later on this evening
when the tide recedes,

245
00:16:03,614 --> 00:16:06,617
those beautiful yellowfin tuna

246
00:16:06,704 --> 00:16:09,446
will have no place to go but
jump on our hooks.

247
00:16:22,372 --> 00:16:25,288
Nice setup you got there.

248
00:16:25,375 --> 00:16:26,681
Thanks.

249
00:16:26,768 --> 00:16:29,989
My dad and I kinda
collect lures.

250
00:16:30,076 --> 00:16:32,469
When I was a kid,
I would beg my dad

251
00:16:32,556 --> 00:16:35,037
to bring me to the sport shop
whenever I had enough money

252
00:16:35,124 --> 00:16:38,649
in my allowance
or birthday card.

253
00:16:38,736 --> 00:16:40,695
I'd run right to
the fishing section

254
00:16:40,782 --> 00:16:44,742
and I'd spend hours picking out
a rainbow jig or fly spinner.

255
00:16:46,179 --> 00:16:49,312
Well, I see you
got one of these.

256
00:16:49,399 --> 00:16:53,055
I got one of these, but never
had to use it, though.

257
00:16:54,056 --> 00:16:56,102
Gotta be prepared.

258
00:16:56,189 --> 00:16:57,277
I see you are.

259
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:01,716
Sure you don't wanna
use live bait?

260
00:17:01,803 --> 00:17:05,981
I mean, those yellowfins
sure do love some mackerel.

261
00:17:06,068 --> 00:17:09,245
Thanks. I prefer the jig.

262
00:17:09,332 --> 00:17:11,334
Less chance of the bait
coming off the hook.

263
00:17:11,421 --> 00:17:16,731
But I will give the mackerel
a shot if my jigs don't hold up.

264
00:17:18,298 --> 00:17:20,648
Spoken like a true angler.

265
00:17:20,735 --> 00:17:23,477
I'm gonna let you get to it.

266
00:17:23,564 --> 00:17:25,261
Think I'm gonna check
on our happy couple.

267
00:17:39,232 --> 00:17:40,755
You two better get
some bait on your hooks.

268
00:17:46,152 --> 00:17:48,719
Oh, those are definitely
not beers.

269
00:17:48,806 --> 00:17:51,113
Nope. Frozen mackerel.

270
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:54,899
Those yellowfins will gobble
them bad boys up, I guarantee.

271
00:17:54,986 --> 00:17:58,338
Shatto, help this fine couple
bait their hooks up, will you?

272
00:17:58,425 --> 00:18:00,122
Aye, Cap.

273
00:18:00,209 --> 00:18:01,297
You wanna give it a try?

274
00:18:01,384 --> 00:18:02,777
Why don't you do the first one

275
00:18:02,864 --> 00:18:05,258
so we'll know how
to do it properly?

276
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:10,611
You're gonna want to get it
right through the eyes.

277
00:18:10,698 --> 00:18:13,614
Right through there
so they can't turn around

278
00:18:13,701 --> 00:18:15,529
and bite the hook. See?

279
00:18:15,616 --> 00:18:16,747
I see.

280
00:18:18,575 --> 00:18:20,751
Right through there. All right.
You can try the next one.

281
00:18:20,838 --> 00:18:23,798
You're all ready to reel in a
real prize catch there, D.

282
00:18:23,885 --> 00:18:25,974
I already got
a prize catch, babe.

283
00:18:26,061 --> 00:18:27,715
Ooh.

284
00:18:42,904 --> 00:18:46,168
How about we up-anchor
and move a bit further out?

285
00:18:50,477 --> 00:18:51,782
Whatever you say, Captain.

286
00:19:07,407 --> 00:19:09,626
Sure about this, Cap?

287
00:19:09,713 --> 00:19:12,455
We never been this far
out on the charter before.

288
00:19:12,542 --> 00:19:14,501
You know, there's a lot more
dangerous things than yellowfin

289
00:19:14,588 --> 00:19:16,111
in the deep water.

290
00:19:16,198 --> 00:19:18,635
Shatto, they came to catch fish.

291
00:19:18,722 --> 00:19:20,333
They don't wanna waste
their time and money.

292
00:19:21,334 --> 00:19:22,465
We'll be fine.

293
00:19:30,473 --> 00:19:31,605
[typing]

294
00:19:34,869 --> 00:19:36,697
[computers beeping]

295
00:19:45,314 --> 00:19:46,837
Yeah.

296
00:19:46,924 --> 00:19:48,448
Yeah, understood.

297
00:19:48,535 --> 00:19:50,319
I'll have him in the sky ASAP.

298
00:20:00,286 --> 00:20:02,810
Davila, we need you
in the air now.

299
00:20:02,897 --> 00:20:04,768
We just got a report
of a jet ski attack

300
00:20:04,855 --> 00:20:06,553
involving sharks.

301
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,816
We need to make
sure these shivers

302
00:20:08,903 --> 00:20:10,818
aren't moving closer to shore.

303
00:20:10,905 --> 00:20:11,819
On my way, Officer Fuentes.

304
00:20:38,411 --> 00:20:39,673
Do you see anything?

305
00:20:42,893 --> 00:20:44,634
Nothing yet.
Just some jet ski debris.

306
00:20:46,767 --> 00:20:49,248
Wait, wait.

307
00:20:49,335 --> 00:20:50,336
I see a whole shiver.

308
00:20:53,295 --> 00:20:55,602
They're attacking the
jet ski debris.

309
00:20:55,689 --> 00:20:56,820
But it makes no sense.

310
00:20:56,907 --> 00:20:58,735
There's nothing for them to eat.

311
00:21:00,737 --> 00:21:02,565
[sighs]

312
00:21:02,652 --> 00:21:05,394
These sharks have gotten more
aggressive in recent years.

313
00:21:05,481 --> 00:21:09,616
My brother just had a run-in,
I don't know, a few months ago.

314
00:21:09,703 --> 00:21:12,445
Yeah, it looks like they're
staying away from shore,

315
00:21:12,532 --> 00:21:14,882
moving more out
in the open water.

316
00:21:14,969 --> 00:21:16,057
Copy that.

317
00:21:19,887 --> 00:21:22,585
My recommendation is to send
a warning out

318
00:21:22,672 --> 00:21:24,892
to all vessels within
10 miles of shore.

319
00:21:24,979 --> 00:21:29,592
No in-water activities, no
swimming or diving, no fishing.

320
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:32,769
These sharks have become
hyper-aggressive nowadays.

321
00:21:32,856 --> 00:21:34,554
All right.

322
00:21:34,641 --> 00:21:35,903
I'll get
the word out immediately,

323
00:21:35,990 --> 00:21:37,426
but you keep flying.

324
00:21:37,513 --> 00:21:39,210
See if you can spot
any more of them.

325
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:41,343
And see if you find out exactly
where they're heading.

326
00:21:41,430 --> 00:21:42,866
Copy that.

327
00:21:42,953 --> 00:21:44,346
I'll stay as close
to them as I can.

328
00:21:44,433 --> 00:21:45,565
All right, good. Out.

329
00:21:46,914 --> 00:21:48,785
Open an emergency line.

330
00:21:51,353 --> 00:21:53,094
Warning!

331
00:21:53,181 --> 00:21:55,662
All vessels must cease in-water
activity immediately!

332
00:21:55,749 --> 00:21:59,318
Make your way back to shore
only if safe to do so!

333
00:21:59,405 --> 00:22:01,711
Be on heightened
alert for sharks.

334
00:22:01,798 --> 00:22:04,540
Contact Marine Search
and Rescue if spotted.

335
00:22:04,627 --> 00:22:08,631
I repeat, all vessels must cease
in-water activity immediately!

336
00:22:51,718 --> 00:22:53,589
Do you want me to help?

337
00:22:53,676 --> 00:22:57,550
This one is kind of putting
a fight, but I think I got it.

338
00:22:57,637 --> 00:22:59,029
- You got it?
- Got it!

339
00:22:59,116 --> 00:22:59,987
No problem!

340
00:23:02,119 --> 00:23:03,469
She's got one?

341
00:23:03,556 --> 00:23:04,905
She's got one!

342
00:23:06,689 --> 00:23:08,038
Whoa!

343
00:23:08,125 --> 00:23:09,649
Looks like we got
a pro over here!

344
00:23:12,042 --> 00:23:13,783
Let's see, a really nice one!

345
00:23:13,870 --> 00:23:15,176
Woo!

346
00:23:18,527 --> 00:23:19,746
First catch of the day.
Now, who's next?

347
00:23:19,833 --> 00:23:21,574
Woo!

348
00:23:21,661 --> 00:23:23,097
Wow.

349
00:23:23,184 --> 00:23:24,620
I can't wait to tell my dad!

350
00:23:24,707 --> 00:23:26,753
I can fillet it up later
for you if you want

351
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:27,754
or if you want
a mount or whatever.

352
00:23:27,841 --> 00:23:29,408
Not sure.

353
00:23:29,495 --> 00:23:31,366
I might catch a bigger one
with my next cast.

354
00:23:31,453 --> 00:23:34,978
- Okay.
- [Banning] I like that spirit!

355
00:23:57,784 --> 00:23:59,481
[reel spinning]

356
00:24:01,048 --> 00:24:02,049
Oh, my God.

357
00:24:03,006 --> 00:24:04,530
Oh, my God!

358
00:24:06,445 --> 00:24:07,794
All right, just stay calm.

359
00:24:07,881 --> 00:24:10,579
Go easy with it.

360
00:24:10,666 --> 00:24:11,972
Just start
to slowly bring it in.

361
00:24:12,059 --> 00:24:13,887
- Okay.
- Reel it in.

362
00:24:13,974 --> 00:24:15,715
The more you fight, the more the
fish will do the same, okay?

363
00:24:15,802 --> 00:24:17,760
Okay. Wyatt, I caught a fish!

364
00:24:17,847 --> 00:24:18,848
You got a fish.

365
00:24:21,895 --> 00:24:23,505
- You got this, D.!
- Oh, my God.

366
00:24:23,592 --> 00:24:26,682
Looks like a lucky day
on the Jubilation!

367
00:24:26,769 --> 00:24:29,685
It usually takes about an hour
before we get the first bite.

368
00:24:29,772 --> 00:24:32,558
Just take it easy,
reel it in and pull.

369
00:24:32,645 --> 00:24:34,908
Reel and pull.

370
00:24:38,128 --> 00:24:40,566
Reel and pull!

371
00:24:40,653 --> 00:24:44,961
[All]
Reel and pull! Reel and pull!

372
00:25:03,414 --> 00:25:05,025
[gasps]

373
00:25:09,246 --> 00:25:11,466
Get her on the boat!

374
00:25:11,553 --> 00:25:15,165
Wyatt! Wyatt!

375
00:25:15,252 --> 00:25:17,037
I've got you, D.!

376
00:25:17,124 --> 00:25:20,562
Wyatt! Wyatt!

377
00:25:20,649 --> 00:25:22,695
Hold on!
Pull her back in the boat.

378
00:25:22,782 --> 00:25:24,087
Just hold on!

379
00:25:24,174 --> 00:25:25,175
Help me up, Wyatt!

380
00:25:27,787 --> 00:25:29,049
Wyatt!

381
00:25:30,877 --> 00:25:33,706
[muffled screams]

382
00:25:36,099 --> 00:25:39,799
[screaming]

383
00:25:39,886 --> 00:25:41,148
Here! Here! This might help!

384
00:25:43,324 --> 00:25:44,717
Grab the net!

385
00:25:44,804 --> 00:25:46,719
Come on!

386
00:25:48,808 --> 00:25:50,810
Stop, stop!

387
00:25:52,899 --> 00:25:53,856
She's gone!

388
00:25:53,943 --> 00:25:56,729
No, no!

389
00:25:56,816 --> 00:25:59,645
I can't let her get away!

390
00:25:59,732 --> 00:26:01,168
Wyatt, no!

391
00:26:01,255 --> 00:26:02,952
[Wyatt] No! No!

392
00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:04,345
[sobs]

393
00:26:08,218 --> 00:26:10,786
I see it, it's right
by the motor!

394
00:26:12,179 --> 00:26:15,312
[engine revs, sputters]

395
00:26:17,619 --> 00:26:20,274
Out of my chair, Wyatt!
Out of my chair!

396
00:26:20,361 --> 00:26:22,581
I told you, I'm the only
one that pilots this ship!

397
00:26:22,668 --> 00:26:25,105
Cut the engine!

398
00:26:25,192 --> 00:26:26,889
We gotta keep moving!

399
00:26:26,976 --> 00:26:27,934
Cut the engine, Cap!
There's something wrong with it!

400
00:26:28,021 --> 00:26:28,935
We gotta get to shore!

401
00:26:29,022 --> 00:26:31,764
[engine sputtering]

402
00:26:31,851 --> 00:26:33,548
We've got to get to shore!

403
00:26:33,635 --> 00:26:35,202
We're gonna be
in major trouble if we don't!

404
00:26:35,289 --> 00:26:36,290
We're gonna be
in trouble if we do!

405
00:26:38,858 --> 00:26:39,772
- No!
- We've got to get Donna!

406
00:26:39,859 --> 00:26:41,208
She's gone!

407
00:26:41,295 --> 00:26:43,689
- We gotta do something!
- She's gone!

408
00:26:43,776 --> 00:26:45,212
- I gotta get Donna!
- She's gone, bro!

409
00:26:45,299 --> 00:26:47,606
- I gotta get Donna!
- She's gone!

410
00:26:47,693 --> 00:26:50,260
- Donna! Donna!
- Wyatt, she's gone!

411
00:26:50,347 --> 00:26:52,175
[engine sputter]

412
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:11,717
Come on!

413
00:27:12,892 --> 00:27:14,197
Come on!

414
00:27:14,284 --> 00:27:15,895
[engine sputters]

415
00:27:19,159 --> 00:27:20,900
Ah!

416
00:27:28,821 --> 00:27:30,953
I'm sorry, Donna.

417
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:32,999
I'm so sorry.

418
00:27:36,785 --> 00:27:38,091
You tried your best
to help her, bro.

419
00:27:39,266 --> 00:27:41,442
That's not gonna bring her back.

420
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:06,336
Donna... She's gone.

421
00:28:06,423 --> 00:28:08,295
She's really gone, man.

422
00:28:11,254 --> 00:28:14,954
I had her in my hands and
she was just here a second ago.

423
00:28:17,173 --> 00:28:21,003
She didn't even want
to go on this fishing trip.

424
00:28:21,090 --> 00:28:22,701
She did it for me.

425
00:28:24,441 --> 00:28:29,229
We were supposed to go horseback
riding on the beach.

426
00:28:47,943 --> 00:28:49,379
I'm...

427
00:28:49,466 --> 00:28:51,077
I'm sorry.

428
00:28:51,164 --> 00:28:53,819
I mean this is horrible, I know.

429
00:28:56,517 --> 00:28:58,345
I'm sorry about Donna, Wyatt.

430
00:29:01,827 --> 00:29:04,220
We gotta figure out how
we can get back to shore.

431
00:29:06,396 --> 00:29:10,966
I mean, we've already
lost one passenger and...

432
00:29:11,053 --> 00:29:14,013
The shark's trashed our engine.

433
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:16,232
Yeah?

434
00:29:16,319 --> 00:29:19,714
What are you gonna
do about it, huh, Captain?

435
00:29:19,801 --> 00:29:21,107
What's your plan?

436
00:29:25,372 --> 00:29:27,809
Wyatt, I think I can fix this.

437
00:29:27,896 --> 00:29:30,464
Let me get what's left
of the net.

438
00:29:50,049 --> 00:29:52,094
I gotta free up the engine
before she'll start.

439
00:29:52,181 --> 00:29:53,400
Shark's caught up in it.

440
00:29:56,577 --> 00:29:57,839
Not looking good, Cap.

441
00:30:00,059 --> 00:30:03,192
I don't know how we're
gonna get her operational.

442
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:05,194
She's not gonna move like this.

443
00:30:19,861 --> 00:30:22,429
I see a problem I can fix.

444
00:30:22,516 --> 00:30:24,170
Let me help you there.

445
00:30:27,477 --> 00:30:28,870
Ah, hooked yourself, huh?

446
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:31,917
It isn't the first time.

447
00:30:34,310 --> 00:30:37,183
You'd be surprised how
many hooks

448
00:30:37,270 --> 00:30:39,315
I've cut out of people
since I started this business.

449
00:30:44,451 --> 00:30:47,323
Okay, keep it steady,
keep it steady. Keep it steady.

450
00:30:47,410 --> 00:30:49,543
- Okay, okay.
- Keep it steady.

451
00:30:54,287 --> 00:30:57,246
Well, I had this one group
of kids

452
00:30:57,333 --> 00:30:59,161
that were casting their
poles like

453
00:30:59,248 --> 00:31:01,250
they were fly-fishing
on an open river.

454
00:31:04,297 --> 00:31:08,518
So this one kid whips
his pole back

455
00:31:08,605 --> 00:31:13,567
and the hook gets caught
in the scalp of the other kid

456
00:31:13,654 --> 00:31:17,179
behind him,
right there behind his ear.

457
00:31:17,266 --> 00:31:20,356
So the kid with the pole
just starts yanking

458
00:31:20,443 --> 00:31:23,098
like he thought his hook

459
00:31:23,185 --> 00:31:25,100
was stuck in a net
or something, I guess.

460
00:31:27,494 --> 00:31:31,324
So the other kid
behind him is...

461
00:31:31,411 --> 00:31:35,197
grabbing the hook out his scalp

462
00:31:35,284 --> 00:31:37,808
and just screaming,

463
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:40,420
like, ahh!

464
00:31:42,204 --> 00:31:46,948
I tried to help,
but I just couldn't get

465
00:31:47,035 --> 00:31:50,517
to the back of
the stern fast enough.

466
00:31:51,953 --> 00:31:54,695
How did the kid take it,
removing the hook?

467
00:31:56,653 --> 00:31:59,395
Well...

468
00:31:59,482 --> 00:32:03,356
Let's just say you did
better than him, champ.

469
00:32:06,272 --> 00:32:07,447
Let me patch that up.

470
00:32:14,236 --> 00:32:15,498
Okay, keep it right there.

471
00:32:20,590 --> 00:32:21,722
Whoa.

472
00:32:23,593 --> 00:32:25,291
It's still alive?

473
00:32:31,558 --> 00:32:33,168
Shatto! Get back!

474
00:32:35,692 --> 00:32:38,043
I got this.

475
00:32:40,393 --> 00:32:41,437
I don't want to be useless.

476
00:32:43,396 --> 00:32:44,658
All right. We can get out
of this

477
00:32:44,745 --> 00:32:46,007
if we work together, brother.

478
00:32:46,094 --> 00:32:48,053
- All right?
- All right, fine.

479
00:32:58,672 --> 00:33:00,369
[shouting]

480
00:33:02,328 --> 00:33:03,982
Dude!

481
00:33:04,069 --> 00:33:05,679
Antagonizing the shark
is not gonna help anything!

482
00:33:08,725 --> 00:33:10,162
Fine.

483
00:33:12,164 --> 00:33:13,687
What do you want me to do?

484
00:33:13,774 --> 00:33:15,471
Right now we have to focus
on getting the oar

485
00:33:15,558 --> 00:33:17,299
between the shark
and the engine.

486
00:33:17,386 --> 00:33:18,779
Can you do this?

487
00:33:20,433 --> 00:33:22,217
Yeah, yeah.

488
00:33:22,304 --> 00:33:23,436
Let's go!

489
00:33:25,525 --> 00:33:26,700
[grunting]

490
00:33:28,136 --> 00:33:30,530
Come on! Get deep in there!

491
00:33:30,617 --> 00:33:32,053
You gotta get all
the way in there.

492
00:33:32,140 --> 00:33:33,272
I'm trying.

493
00:33:33,359 --> 00:33:34,708
Come on, push!

494
00:33:37,015 --> 00:33:39,234
Keep pushing!

495
00:33:39,321 --> 00:33:41,541
- It's moving, man!
- Keep going, keep going.

496
00:33:41,628 --> 00:33:42,759
It's moving!

497
00:33:47,764 --> 00:33:49,549
Oh, shit!

498
00:33:49,636 --> 00:33:51,725
Man overboard! Get him the oar!

499
00:33:54,293 --> 00:33:55,772
Wyatt! Wyatt!

500
00:33:55,859 --> 00:33:56,817
Pull him in!

501
00:33:57,992 --> 00:33:59,559
Do you see him?

502
00:34:05,304 --> 00:34:06,609
He's over here!

503
00:34:09,221 --> 00:34:10,526
Get back into the boat!

504
00:34:10,613 --> 00:34:11,745
Wyatt, get out of
the water right now!

505
00:34:11,832 --> 00:34:13,051
Back here! Come on, Wyatt!

506
00:34:13,138 --> 00:34:14,661
Get back to the boat!

507
00:34:26,325 --> 00:34:27,326
I'll kill you,
you piece of shit!

508
00:34:27,413 --> 00:34:28,457
Wyatt, listen to me!

509
00:34:28,544 --> 00:34:30,416
This will not bring her back!

510
00:34:30,503 --> 00:34:32,809
Wyatt, get out of the water
and get in the boat!

511
00:34:41,209 --> 00:34:42,732
Wyatt, get back in the boat!

512
00:34:42,819 --> 00:34:46,127
Hey, you guys see that?
I killed the shark!

513
00:34:48,521 --> 00:34:50,610
Wyatt! Look out!
There's another one!

514
00:34:58,705 --> 00:34:59,706
- Wyatt!
- Come on, Wyatt!

515
00:34:59,793 --> 00:35:01,708
- Swim!
- Faster!

516
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:06,365
Wyatt!

517
00:35:17,854 --> 00:35:21,597
We gotta get
this engine sorted out.

518
00:35:21,684 --> 00:35:23,121
There's more of them.

519
00:35:26,254 --> 00:35:27,429
We gotta move, Captain.

520
00:35:36,177 --> 00:35:38,397
Three of them.

521
00:35:38,484 --> 00:35:39,920
Never seen them act
this way before.

522
00:35:40,964 --> 00:35:43,358
Probably desperate for food

523
00:35:43,445 --> 00:35:46,448
with the number of fish
being so low this year.

524
00:35:46,535 --> 00:35:47,493
Exactly.

525
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:49,277
I mean, either we sit here

526
00:35:49,364 --> 00:35:51,323
and wait for them to come to us
or we get back to shore.

527
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:55,675
Back to shore.

528
00:35:55,762 --> 00:35:57,546
I agree.

529
00:35:57,633 --> 00:36:00,158
Shatto, see if you can
get that engine fixed.

530
00:36:01,637 --> 00:36:02,769
On it, Captain.

531
00:36:07,556 --> 00:36:08,601
No luck, captain.

532
00:36:08,688 --> 00:36:10,559
It's pretty shot.

533
00:36:10,646 --> 00:36:12,605
I want to check the electrical
and see if that's the issue.

534
00:36:12,692 --> 00:36:16,565
Gotcha. And the radio signal
is being spotty.

535
00:36:17,610 --> 00:36:20,352
Any ideas?

536
00:36:20,439 --> 00:36:22,528
You know, I don't
bring my phone onboard.

537
00:36:22,615 --> 00:36:23,616
I got a phone.

538
00:36:26,271 --> 00:36:27,924
What's the emergency
number in Mexico?

539
00:36:29,317 --> 00:36:31,537
Same as it is in
the United States, kid.

540
00:36:31,624 --> 00:36:33,016
911.

541
00:36:33,103 --> 00:36:35,280
But good luck
with getting through.

542
00:36:35,367 --> 00:36:39,240
Fast response is
not their forte around here.

543
00:36:39,327 --> 00:36:41,416
I'll call my dad. He knows a lot
of people in the area

544
00:36:41,503 --> 00:36:42,504
who might be able to help.

545
00:36:46,726 --> 00:36:48,423
The reception is spotty but...

546
00:36:48,510 --> 00:36:50,295
I'll try to get through.

547
00:36:53,776 --> 00:36:55,213
No.

548
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:56,736
What is it?

549
00:36:56,823 --> 00:36:58,477
Battery's low.

550
00:36:58,564 --> 00:37:00,348
Well, make this call count.

551
00:37:01,654 --> 00:37:02,959
It's ringing.

552
00:37:11,359 --> 00:37:13,405
Okay... okay.

553
00:37:13,492 --> 00:37:14,710
[phone rings]

554
00:37:14,797 --> 00:37:17,583
Oh...

555
00:37:17,670 --> 00:37:19,411
[sighs]

556
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:22,762
Dad?

557
00:37:22,849 --> 00:37:24,677
Hey!

558
00:37:24,764 --> 00:37:26,548
You're back so soon, huh?

559
00:37:26,635 --> 00:37:29,203
Did the ocean run out of fish?

560
00:37:29,290 --> 00:37:30,596
Listen.

561
00:37:30,683 --> 00:37:32,772
There's been
a really bad accident.

562
00:37:32,859 --> 00:37:34,426
I'm okay, but...

563
00:37:37,864 --> 00:37:41,389
Two others fell off the boat

564
00:37:41,476 --> 00:37:46,655
and were eaten by sharks
and our engine just seized.

565
00:37:46,742 --> 00:37:48,657
Okay.

566
00:37:48,744 --> 00:37:52,313
Sharks...

567
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:54,881
did you call
the Coast Guard, honey?

568
00:37:54,968 --> 00:37:56,535
Our radio was damaged
during the attack.

569
00:37:58,885 --> 00:38:02,497
They won't make it
out here in time, dad.

570
00:38:02,584 --> 00:38:05,370
We're dead in the water and
there are so many of them.

571
00:38:05,457 --> 00:38:06,806
There's so many sharks.

572
00:38:07,981 --> 00:38:10,723
Okay, okay, honey.
Stay calm, okay?

573
00:38:10,810 --> 00:38:14,770
I will relay the message to
my contacts down there, okay?

574
00:38:14,857 --> 00:38:16,946
What is your location?

575
00:38:17,033 --> 00:38:19,645
Uh..

576
00:38:19,732 --> 00:38:22,474
The coordinates are 22 degrees,
52 and 46 west,

577
00:38:22,561 --> 00:38:24,476
and 110 degrees, 3 and 22 north.

578
00:38:24,563 --> 00:38:25,999
Okay, okay.

579
00:38:26,086 --> 00:38:28,480
Stay on the line and

580
00:38:28,567 --> 00:38:30,656
I'm going to call my friends
on the landline...

581
00:38:30,743 --> 00:38:32,484
Dad, I can't. My battery is low.

582
00:38:32,571 --> 00:38:33,920
I have to save the battery.

583
00:38:34,964 --> 00:38:37,315
Okay, so just sit tight.

584
00:38:37,402 --> 00:38:38,533
I've got this.

585
00:38:38,620 --> 00:38:41,580
I'll get someone
there soon, okay?

586
00:38:46,759 --> 00:38:49,501
I've never seen
so much blood before.

587
00:38:49,588 --> 00:38:51,894
Baby, baby, it's okay.

588
00:38:51,981 --> 00:38:56,029
I'll get the Coast Guard
there soon, okay?

589
00:38:56,116 --> 00:38:58,814
Look, you're safe on that boat

590
00:38:58,901 --> 00:39:02,427
and you are the most comfortable
when you're on the water.

591
00:39:02,514 --> 00:39:03,906
Remember that, honey.

592
00:39:04,994 --> 00:39:06,735
Yes.

593
00:39:07,997 --> 00:39:10,043
You got this, you hear?

594
00:39:14,613 --> 00:39:15,701
Okay.

595
00:39:15,788 --> 00:39:17,006
Yeah, I can do this.

596
00:39:18,007 --> 00:39:20,358
Just... please hurry, dad.

597
00:39:21,576 --> 00:39:23,361
I love you.

598
00:39:23,448 --> 00:39:25,537
I love you too, Lucia.

599
00:39:32,108 --> 00:39:33,632
[sighs]

600
00:39:38,985 --> 00:39:40,813
Yes, hello.

601
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:44,643
I am on land, but I am
relaying an emergency

602
00:39:44,730 --> 00:39:47,820
of a boat that is
stalled off the coast.

603
00:39:47,907 --> 00:39:49,909
Si, yes.

604
00:39:49,996 --> 00:39:54,435
And there's been two
fatalities... shark attacks.

605
00:39:56,045 --> 00:40:00,963
Could you please get me
with the Coast Guard, please?

606
00:40:01,050 --> 00:40:02,487
No, no, now!

607
00:40:02,574 --> 00:40:04,619
My daughter is in danger.

608
00:40:04,706 --> 00:40:07,579
No, no!
Don't put me on hold, please!

609
00:40:07,666 --> 00:40:09,972
You...!

610
00:40:12,584 --> 00:40:14,586
Oh...

611
00:40:32,647 --> 00:40:34,214
He's calling the Coast Guard.

612
00:40:35,868 --> 00:40:37,043
Someone will be here soon.

613
00:40:38,610 --> 00:40:40,786
How does that engine look?

614
00:40:40,873 --> 00:40:42,744
Bad news, cap.

615
00:40:42,831 --> 00:40:44,485
We got a few stripped gears.

616
00:40:46,008 --> 00:40:48,707
A little bit of a burnout,
but it's not fatal.

617
00:40:48,794 --> 00:40:51,144
I'm doubtful we can get
it up and running, though,

618
00:40:51,231 --> 00:40:53,581
without a total overhaul.

619
00:40:53,668 --> 00:40:57,150
Best to let it rest and
not risk a total flame-out.

620
00:40:57,237 --> 00:40:59,674
See what you can do
to get us going.

621
00:40:59,761 --> 00:41:01,241
Aye, aye, Cap.

622
00:41:13,471 --> 00:41:14,820
[Dad]
Okay, my daughter is out there.

623
00:41:14,907 --> 00:41:16,169
[Operator]
Sir, we're getting someone

624
00:41:16,256 --> 00:41:17,910
as soon as we can, okay?

625
00:41:17,997 --> 00:41:19,259
Okay, please hurry.

626
00:41:40,933 --> 00:41:46,025
So I said, "Wrecked 'em?
Damn near killed 'em!"

627
00:41:46,112 --> 00:41:47,853
That gets funnier
every time you tell it.

628
00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:49,463
Hey, come on. That's a classic.

629
00:41:49,550 --> 00:41:52,858
Try to get a new joke, Captain.

630
00:41:52,945 --> 00:41:54,599
Your phone's buzzing.

631
00:41:56,122 --> 00:41:57,471
Jose, old barnacle!

632
00:41:57,558 --> 00:41:58,864
When are you
gonna come down here?

633
00:41:58,951 --> 00:42:00,518
We'll tear up this port
like we used to.

634
00:42:00,605 --> 00:42:02,215
All right, Dan,
there's an emergency.

635
00:42:02,302 --> 00:42:05,218
Lucia took a fishing
cruise today

636
00:42:05,305 --> 00:42:08,874
and there's been
a couple fatalities.

637
00:42:08,961 --> 00:42:10,528
Is she okay?

638
00:42:10,615 --> 00:42:11,659
How can I help?

639
00:42:11,746 --> 00:42:14,053
Look, she's stranded

640
00:42:14,140 --> 00:42:17,491
and there have been some shark
attacks, a couple fatalities.

641
00:42:17,578 --> 00:42:19,188
And I called the Coast Guard,

642
00:42:19,275 --> 00:42:21,713
but God only knows when
they'll show up, right?

643
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:23,802
Yeah, it'll be sundown
before they get there

644
00:42:23,889 --> 00:42:25,194
and that's if she's lucky.

645
00:42:25,281 --> 00:42:28,676
Is the Dew Drop up
and running yet?

646
00:42:28,763 --> 00:42:29,808
Give me a pen.

647
00:42:29,895 --> 00:42:31,766
No, no, she's in the shop.

648
00:42:31,853 --> 00:42:34,769
But I'll tell you what.
I can wrangle up something.

649
00:42:34,856 --> 00:42:37,642
Look, I'm sorry I couldn't get
her on the charter myself...

650
00:42:37,729 --> 00:42:40,035
No, no, no! Don't be sorry.

651
00:42:40,122 --> 00:42:41,646
You can make it up to me
by getting me a boat

652
00:42:41,733 --> 00:42:42,734
as fast as you can
get me out there

653
00:42:42,821 --> 00:42:44,300
as fast as you can, please!

654
00:42:44,387 --> 00:42:46,781
No, I'm gonna get us
out there fast, okay?

655
00:42:46,868 --> 00:42:49,567
I'm not letting you alone out
at sea with that foot of yours.

656
00:42:49,654 --> 00:42:51,351
Now give me the coordinates.

657
00:42:54,963 --> 00:42:56,661
Okay, buddy.

658
00:42:56,748 --> 00:42:59,533
I promise you I'm gonna wrangle
up something, all right?

659
00:42:59,620 --> 00:43:01,274
We're gonna
get your little girl.

660
00:43:01,361 --> 00:43:04,669
I need to warn you, my friend,
there are sharks involved.

661
00:43:06,584 --> 00:43:07,976
It's never easy, is it?

662
00:43:08,063 --> 00:43:10,500
Well, we'll just have
to leave sooner

663
00:43:10,588 --> 00:43:12,285
than I thought, that's all.

664
00:43:12,372 --> 00:43:14,548
It'll be impossible
to find them once the sun sets.

665
00:43:14,635 --> 00:43:17,595
Thanks, Dan. I owe you.

666
00:43:18,465 --> 00:43:19,771
I'm on it.

667
00:43:21,381 --> 00:43:23,122
Give me another coffee,
a big one.

668
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:30,042
Okay.

669
00:43:30,129 --> 00:43:34,960
She's gonna be okay,
por favor, Jesus.

670
00:43:35,047 --> 00:43:36,744
She's going to be okay.

671
00:43:50,192 --> 00:43:51,803
We haven't moved
in such a long time.

672
00:43:51,890 --> 00:43:53,718
And all this blood splattered
against the boat,

673
00:43:53,805 --> 00:43:55,110
they probably think
we're another shark

674
00:43:55,197 --> 00:43:58,766
or a whale a.k.a. dinner.

675
00:43:58,853 --> 00:44:00,725
Yeah, I'm working as
fast as I can.

676
00:44:00,812 --> 00:44:02,944
This motor is still jammed.

677
00:44:03,031 --> 00:44:06,339
Once that sun goes down...

678
00:44:06,426 --> 00:44:08,428
I know, Cap, I know.

679
00:44:11,387 --> 00:44:12,911
How you holding up?

680
00:44:16,305 --> 00:44:18,786
Is that hand hurting you?

681
00:44:18,873 --> 00:44:20,788
Doesn't even hurt.

682
00:44:20,875 --> 00:44:23,312
I'm still running
off of adrenaline.

683
00:44:23,399 --> 00:44:25,663
I don't feel a thing.

684
00:44:25,750 --> 00:44:26,794
Good.

685
00:44:26,881 --> 00:44:28,666
Adrenalin's good.

686
00:44:28,753 --> 00:44:31,669
Keeps you alert, on your toes.

687
00:44:31,756 --> 00:44:33,279
So...

688
00:44:36,848 --> 00:44:37,936
We're gonna make it out of this.

689
00:44:40,329 --> 00:44:42,723
Got it?

690
00:44:42,810 --> 00:44:44,203
Yep.

691
00:44:44,290 --> 00:44:46,684
Yeah, I know my
dad's gonna pull through.

692
00:44:46,771 --> 00:44:48,337
We'll put through.

693
00:44:48,424 --> 00:44:49,861
And you're gonna have
one hell of a fish tale

694
00:44:49,948 --> 00:44:51,732
to tell him when you see him.

695
00:45:02,351 --> 00:45:04,049
[gasps]

696
00:45:08,401 --> 00:45:09,881
On, no!

697
00:45:09,968 --> 00:45:12,013
We're taking in water!

698
00:45:12,100 --> 00:45:14,929
Oh my God.

699
00:45:15,016 --> 00:45:17,149
The hull can't keep taking
a beating like this, Cap.

700
00:45:17,236 --> 00:45:18,933
She'll break into pieces!

701
00:45:19,020 --> 00:45:20,892
It's just us out here!

702
00:45:20,979 --> 00:45:22,720
We don't have the luxury of
waiting for help to arrive!

703
00:45:24,939 --> 00:45:27,333
We need to find land...
and fast.

704
00:45:27,420 --> 00:45:28,726
And the wind is picking up.

705
00:45:28,813 --> 00:45:30,162
We'll be blown further out soon.

706
00:45:30,249 --> 00:45:34,166
No, no, that's
actually a good thing.

707
00:45:34,253 --> 00:45:36,037
We're drifting, so the wind
will point us

708
00:45:36,124 --> 00:45:38,823
into the direction of the
sandbar that we were at earlier.

709
00:45:38,910 --> 00:45:40,999
And that should
buy us some time.

710
00:45:41,086 --> 00:45:43,088
But we're gonna have to help
this old girl along

711
00:45:43,175 --> 00:45:44,176
if we're gonna make it out.

712
00:45:59,278 --> 00:46:00,801
We're gonna have to move!

713
00:46:00,888 --> 00:46:02,977
She's not gonna be
seaworthy much longer!

714
00:46:03,064 --> 00:46:05,066
Can we use the oars to paddle?

715
00:46:05,153 --> 00:46:06,241
We'll have to try.

716
00:46:06,328 --> 00:46:07,895
You start paddling.

717
00:46:07,982 --> 00:46:09,462
Try not to provoke the sharks.

718
00:46:09,549 --> 00:46:12,030
But give 'em a good whack
if you have to.

719
00:46:12,117 --> 00:46:14,075
- [grunting]
- There it is!

720
00:46:14,162 --> 00:46:15,381
The sandbar!

721
00:46:19,298 --> 00:46:20,560
[grunting]

722
00:46:23,998 --> 00:46:27,872
Put your backs into it, people!

723
00:46:27,959 --> 00:46:29,699
Keep on paddling!

724
00:46:29,787 --> 00:46:31,919
We're almost to the sandbar!

725
00:46:40,885 --> 00:46:41,886
[grunting]

726
00:46:44,105 --> 00:46:46,020
Aye, aye, Captain!

727
00:46:53,245 --> 00:46:54,376
We hit ground!

728
00:46:58,859 --> 00:47:00,382
Nice job, crew.

729
00:47:03,603 --> 00:47:05,431
So I don't think
we're gonna sink for a bit.

730
00:47:09,087 --> 00:47:10,915
Thanks, Cap.

731
00:47:11,002 --> 00:47:13,047
I think it'll be too shallow
for the sharks here,

732
00:47:13,134 --> 00:47:16,181
but they are smart creatures,
so we need to be careful.

733
00:47:16,268 --> 00:47:19,880
But we've only bought ourselves,
you know, a little bit of time.

734
00:47:19,967 --> 00:47:23,101
We're already on
the high end of an ebb and flow.

735
00:47:31,544 --> 00:47:33,807
It doesn't seem
like they're leaving.

736
00:47:33,894 --> 00:47:36,984
We can only hope that they
get bored, but I doubt it.

737
00:47:37,071 --> 00:47:39,117
We're gonna be easy pickings
at high tide.

738
00:47:42,990 --> 00:47:44,252
There...

739
00:47:44,339 --> 00:47:45,427
There.

740
00:47:45,514 --> 00:47:47,038
It's a boat!

741
00:47:47,125 --> 00:47:48,213
Our luck's 'turned around!

742
00:47:49,910 --> 00:47:51,346
Hey!

743
00:47:53,044 --> 00:47:54,915
Hey!

744
00:47:55,002 --> 00:47:56,569
Help!

745
00:48:00,225 --> 00:48:04,533
Hey! Help, over here!

746
00:48:04,620 --> 00:48:06,492
[shouting]

747
00:48:07,493 --> 00:48:10,452
Help! Over here!

748
00:48:10,539 --> 00:48:13,586
The sky's too bright.
They can't see the flare.

749
00:48:13,673 --> 00:48:17,198
They can't hear us either.
Engine's too loud.

750
00:48:18,243 --> 00:48:21,855
Hey! Over here!

751
00:48:21,942 --> 00:48:23,726
Hey!

752
00:48:27,556 --> 00:48:28,993
[screams]

753
00:48:30,342 --> 00:48:32,170
Hurry, stand up!

754
00:48:32,257 --> 00:48:33,475
You can stand on the sandbar!

755
00:48:34,999 --> 00:48:36,522
Mayday!

756
00:48:36,609 --> 00:48:38,350
Can anyone hear me?

757
00:48:38,437 --> 00:48:39,917
Mayday!

758
00:48:51,450 --> 00:48:53,539
[screams]

759
00:48:53,626 --> 00:48:56,063
- Shatto!
- Lucia!

760
00:48:56,150 --> 00:48:57,325
Come here!

761
00:48:58,326 --> 00:49:00,546
- Lucia!
- Shatto!

762
00:49:00,633 --> 00:49:02,374
I'm coming!

763
00:49:03,679 --> 00:49:05,203
[shouts]

764
00:49:14,386 --> 00:49:16,518
[groans]

765
00:49:19,478 --> 00:49:21,349
[crying]

766
00:49:29,705 --> 00:49:31,577
[groaning]

767
00:49:33,579 --> 00:49:36,321
Come on, baby. Come on.

768
00:49:36,408 --> 00:49:37,713
Watch her legs.

769
00:49:39,585 --> 00:49:41,717
Come on, move, Shatto!
I got you!

770
00:49:46,722 --> 00:49:48,898
[groaning]

771
00:49:48,986 --> 00:49:50,335
We're gonna have to put

772
00:49:50,422 --> 00:49:53,294
a tourniquet on
this wound, pronto!

773
00:49:53,381 --> 00:49:55,514
How bad is it?

774
00:49:57,298 --> 00:49:58,604
I'm not gonna lie to you, kid.

775
00:49:58,691 --> 00:50:00,432
Getting bit by
a shark is not good.

776
00:50:02,651 --> 00:50:04,436
It hurts.

777
00:50:07,091 --> 00:50:09,310
Tell me... tell me something.

778
00:50:09,397 --> 00:50:11,617
Listen to me, listen to me.

779
00:50:11,704 --> 00:50:14,185
Eyes up here to me!
Eyes up here to me!

780
00:50:14,272 --> 00:50:15,273
Eyes up here to me, kid.

781
00:50:15,360 --> 00:50:17,971
Tell me something.

782
00:50:18,058 --> 00:50:19,059
Why do you like to fish?

783
00:50:20,278 --> 00:50:21,931
Wh-what?

784
00:50:22,019 --> 00:50:24,151
Why do you like to fish, Lucia?

785
00:50:24,238 --> 00:50:25,587
Why do you like to fish?

786
00:50:28,634 --> 00:50:32,768
Because it's as simple
as life can get for you.

787
00:50:34,379 --> 00:50:36,250
It's, uh... oh!

788
00:50:36,337 --> 00:50:38,557
Yeah, come on.
Come on, baby girl, come on.

789
00:50:38,644 --> 00:50:41,647
It's... it's one person

790
00:50:41,734 --> 00:50:45,390
and one fish with a
thin line between you.

791
00:50:47,131 --> 00:50:50,743
And sometimes...

792
00:50:50,830 --> 00:50:54,486
you make that cast
and you make that connection

793
00:50:54,573 --> 00:50:59,012
and sometimes you don't.

794
00:50:59,099 --> 00:51:01,580
There's no wiggle
room in between.

795
00:51:04,322 --> 00:51:08,108
Life doesn't...

796
00:51:08,195 --> 00:51:11,416
Life doesn't really offer up
that many absolutes like that.

797
00:51:11,503 --> 00:51:13,635
Yeah, I like that.

798
00:51:13,722 --> 00:51:19,685
It's like you get the fish or
the fish gets you, right?

799
00:51:19,772 --> 00:51:23,689
Plus, it give me more time
to spend with my dad.

800
00:51:27,171 --> 00:51:29,086
Come on, come on!

801
00:51:30,826 --> 00:51:34,439
When...

802
00:51:34,526 --> 00:51:40,227
After my mom passed, we both
felt like were on borrowed time.

803
00:51:41,359 --> 00:51:44,449
And we were terrified
that something

804
00:51:44,536 --> 00:51:46,320
would just come along
and tear us apart.

805
00:51:48,322 --> 00:51:49,976
Yeah, yeah.

806
00:51:50,063 --> 00:51:52,326
I actually lost my mother
when I was young, too.

807
00:51:52,413 --> 00:51:54,676
And it's not something you
ever really get over.

808
00:51:58,680 --> 00:51:59,725
I can't die out here.

809
00:51:59,812 --> 00:52:01,292
No, no, no, no.

810
00:52:01,379 --> 00:52:02,684
I can't leave my dad alone.

811
00:52:02,771 --> 00:52:04,730
No, no, not today,
kid, not today.

812
00:52:04,817 --> 00:52:06,210
You're not dying on me,
not today.

813
00:52:06,297 --> 00:52:08,473
It's not gonna happen, okay?

814
00:52:08,560 --> 00:52:11,171
You'll be fishing with
your father again real soon.

815
00:52:12,694 --> 00:52:14,305
Hey, hey.

816
00:52:14,392 --> 00:52:17,134
It just mouthed you,
Lucia, okay?

817
00:52:17,221 --> 00:52:18,352
Barely a bite.

818
00:52:20,224 --> 00:52:21,921
You hear that?

819
00:52:22,008 --> 00:52:23,749
Just took a little gnaw at you,
just a little gnaw.

820
00:52:26,186 --> 00:52:28,493
Even though,
a little bite from a shark

821
00:52:28,580 --> 00:52:30,408
is still a pretty big bite.

822
00:52:30,495 --> 00:52:32,236
Not helping, Shatto.

823
00:52:35,239 --> 00:52:37,676
You must taste like crap, kid.

824
00:52:37,763 --> 00:52:40,331
He took a bite out of you
and just spit you right out.

825
00:52:40,418 --> 00:52:42,942
There's so much blood, though.

826
00:52:44,770 --> 00:52:48,600
I wanna call my dad.
I wanna call my dad.

827
00:52:48,687 --> 00:52:50,950
Just sit up. Sit up.

828
00:52:55,650 --> 00:52:56,695
No!

829
00:52:56,782 --> 00:53:00,351
My phone is missing!

830
00:53:00,438 --> 00:53:02,788
My bag must have been torn,
it's ruined.

831
00:53:02,875 --> 00:53:05,660
Come on, sit back, sit back.

832
00:53:05,747 --> 00:53:07,184
[panting]

833
00:53:15,366 --> 00:53:17,455
I can't die out here.

834
00:53:18,978 --> 00:53:20,806
I need you to breathe.

835
00:53:20,893 --> 00:53:24,549
Don't over exert yourself.

836
00:53:24,636 --> 00:53:26,464
I need you to breathe.
I need you to breathe.

837
00:53:26,551 --> 00:53:28,161
Come on, breathe.

838
00:53:28,248 --> 00:53:29,945
There you go.

839
00:53:32,339 --> 00:53:34,863
She's gonna go into shock.
We can't lose her.

840
00:53:34,950 --> 00:53:37,344
She's a soldier.

841
00:53:37,431 --> 00:53:39,216
She's not gonna make
it much longer, man,

842
00:53:39,303 --> 00:53:41,130
if we don't hurry
to get her help.

843
00:53:41,218 --> 00:53:43,698
We got about a couple of hours.

844
00:53:43,785 --> 00:53:45,265
Yeah, that's a lot of blood.

845
00:53:45,352 --> 00:53:48,573
Just need you to keep
the tourniquet tight

846
00:53:48,660 --> 00:53:50,183
and make sure
it doesn't loosen up.

847
00:53:50,270 --> 00:53:53,578
All Right. I'll do what
I can to keep her awake.

848
00:53:53,665 --> 00:53:55,188
Thank you.

849
00:53:55,275 --> 00:53:57,843
Time is really working
against us.

850
00:54:36,708 --> 00:54:40,668
[speaking Spanish]

851
00:54:55,074 --> 00:54:58,207
S.O.S. from a fishing vessel,
shark attack, two casualties.

852
00:54:58,295 --> 00:54:59,252
Copy.

853
00:54:59,339 --> 00:55:00,645
Where's the vessel?

854
00:55:00,732 --> 00:55:02,255
[TK421] What's your location?

855
00:55:02,342 --> 00:55:03,691
Officer Fuentes told us
to reach out to you

856
00:55:03,778 --> 00:55:05,302
for possible assistance.

857
00:55:05,389 --> 00:55:07,652
Well, a couple of miles
south of Cabo San Lucas.

858
00:55:07,739 --> 00:55:09,436
Scanning the shoreline
for sharks.

859
00:55:09,523 --> 00:55:10,481
I'm already following
one shiver.

860
00:55:10,568 --> 00:55:12,004
Where do you need me to be?

861
00:55:12,091 --> 00:55:13,658
[TK421] Should get a visual
on them shortly.

862
00:55:13,745 --> 00:55:16,356
Then we'll give you
exact coordinates.

863
00:55:16,443 --> 00:55:18,489
Roger that. Keep me posted.

864
00:55:18,576 --> 00:55:19,664
Stay safe.

865
00:55:22,797 --> 00:55:24,408
All right.

866
00:55:24,495 --> 00:55:27,498
I need everyone to contact
every vessel they can.

867
00:55:27,585 --> 00:55:31,458
Find out if anybody saw anything
regarding that jet ski attack.

868
00:55:31,545 --> 00:55:34,679
And find out if anybody knows
anything about the Jubilation.

869
00:55:41,425 --> 00:55:42,774
Come on, Lucia!

870
00:55:44,428 --> 00:55:45,733
See anything?

871
00:55:45,820 --> 00:55:48,301
No.

872
00:55:48,388 --> 00:55:49,694
It's clear seas.

873
00:55:53,611 --> 00:55:55,090
Can't this thing
go any faster, Dan?

874
00:55:55,177 --> 00:55:58,572
It's all I could get
on such short notice.

875
00:55:58,659 --> 00:56:00,531
It's not a speedster,
but it floats.

876
00:56:02,620 --> 00:56:05,536
Well, look at that!

877
00:56:05,623 --> 00:56:07,059
It looks like the Guard's have
finally gotten off their butts

878
00:56:07,146 --> 00:56:09,931
and doing their job!

879
00:56:10,018 --> 00:56:12,412
TK-421.

880
00:56:18,026 --> 00:56:20,289
TK-421!

881
00:56:20,377 --> 00:56:21,987
[speaking Spanish]

882
00:56:28,123 --> 00:56:30,387
TK-421!

883
00:56:32,476 --> 00:56:34,826
[speaking Spanish]

884
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:54,976
Didn't they send a chopper?

885
00:56:56,848 --> 00:56:59,590
[speaking Spanish]

886
00:57:12,951 --> 00:57:15,170
[speaking Spanish]

887
00:57:25,224 --> 00:57:27,705
Try to catch up with them!

888
00:57:27,792 --> 00:57:29,576
I'll try. They're a heck
of a lot faster

889
00:57:29,663 --> 00:57:31,665
than this old floater.

890
00:57:31,752 --> 00:57:33,362
Good news that the
Guard's out looking for 'em.

891
00:57:33,450 --> 00:57:35,060
Si.

892
00:57:35,147 --> 00:57:36,888
We're gonna find her, my friend.

893
00:57:40,544 --> 00:57:41,806
I can't keep up with them,

894
00:57:41,893 --> 00:57:44,156
but eventually we'll
catch up to 'em.

895
00:57:47,812 --> 00:57:49,727
Thank you, Dan.

896
00:57:49,814 --> 00:57:52,164
I appreciate you doing this.

897
00:57:52,251 --> 00:57:54,993
I owe you one, my friend.

898
00:57:55,080 --> 00:57:56,734
Hey, you and your daughter
just have dinner with me

899
00:57:56,821 --> 00:57:58,170
when this is all over.

900
00:57:58,257 --> 00:57:59,650
And then we'll call
it even, right?

901
00:57:59,737 --> 00:58:01,260
You got yourself a deal.

902
00:58:03,567 --> 00:58:04,698
She's gonna be okay, my friend.

903
00:58:08,920 --> 00:58:10,008
[Banning] Eventually the tide
will get high enough

904
00:58:10,095 --> 00:58:12,010
to pull us off the reef.

905
00:58:12,097 --> 00:58:14,447
We don't have much time before
the boat starts to sink again.

906
00:58:14,534 --> 00:58:16,144
How's Lucia?

907
00:58:16,231 --> 00:58:17,972
[Shatto] She's good.

908
00:58:18,059 --> 00:58:21,193
She's stopped bleeding for now.
Her color's coming back.

909
00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:22,281
You know I can hear you.

910
00:58:22,368 --> 00:58:25,240
Man, stop being a big ass baby.

911
00:58:25,327 --> 00:58:26,677
You're going to
run out of bandages, you know.

912
00:58:29,157 --> 00:58:30,898
Got plenty.

913
00:58:30,985 --> 00:58:33,118
But you are gonna be
looking like a few mummies

914
00:58:33,205 --> 00:58:34,598
in a little while.

915
00:58:35,773 --> 00:58:37,209
[chuckles]

916
00:58:38,863 --> 00:58:42,214
Lucia, wake up, please.

917
00:58:42,301 --> 00:58:45,043
Can't have you falling asleep
until we get some help.

918
00:58:50,265 --> 00:58:51,919
You okay?

919
00:58:52,006 --> 00:58:55,053
Um, yeah.

920
00:58:55,140 --> 00:58:56,620
Actually, I'm the only one

921
00:58:56,707 --> 00:58:59,927
that's not cut up
or bit, aren't I?

922
00:59:00,014 --> 00:59:01,581
Yeah, but you should rest.

923
00:59:01,668 --> 00:59:03,148
I mean, you're taking
care of everybody.

924
00:59:03,235 --> 00:59:05,803
It's the captain's job,
my friend.

925
00:59:08,719 --> 00:59:11,025
Hey!

926
00:59:11,112 --> 00:59:13,680
Get up! We can't have you
falling asleep, Lucia.

927
00:59:13,767 --> 00:59:15,160
On your feet, soldier.

928
00:59:18,250 --> 00:59:19,599
On your feet!

929
00:59:23,168 --> 00:59:25,736
Okay, okay, I'm up, I'm up.

930
00:59:25,823 --> 00:59:28,086
Try not to put any
weight on your leg.

931
00:59:28,173 --> 00:59:31,045
You can prop it up
if you need to, okay?

932
00:59:31,132 --> 00:59:33,831
I'm gonna go below deck to see
if I can find something to help.

933
00:59:38,705 --> 00:59:40,664
You care about
him a lot, don't you?

934
00:59:42,056 --> 00:59:44,798
Yeah.

935
00:59:44,885 --> 00:59:49,542
When I first came here from
Hawaii, I didn't know anybody.

936
00:59:49,629 --> 00:59:53,590
Captain took me in when nobody
else would, gave me a job,

937
00:59:53,677 --> 00:59:55,200
taught me all about this boat,

938
00:59:55,287 --> 00:59:57,028
and gave my life purpose

939
00:59:57,115 --> 00:59:58,638
when it didn't have any.

940
01:00:00,771 --> 01:00:02,207
Kind of like you said.

941
01:00:03,861 --> 01:00:05,689
Life doesn't give
you many absolutes.

942
01:00:07,342 --> 01:00:09,040
So the captain is your absolute.

943
01:00:13,218 --> 01:00:15,960
Well, I absolutely
wouldn't be here without him,

944
01:00:16,047 --> 01:00:19,050
for better or worse.

945
01:00:19,137 --> 01:00:23,228
He helped me, so I'd
do anything to help him.

946
01:00:23,315 --> 01:00:25,796
If you sad sacks
stop talking about me,

947
01:00:25,883 --> 01:00:28,842
maybe I can give you
a perfect update.

948
01:00:28,929 --> 01:00:33,847
Water's filling up
quickly below in the deck.

949
01:00:33,934 --> 01:00:37,155
This means that we have to
jump on the offense situation.

950
01:00:37,242 --> 01:00:40,332
Now these sharks
are beautiful creatures.

951
01:00:42,377 --> 01:00:44,162
Massive monsters,

952
01:00:44,249 --> 01:00:48,688
who survived on sheer grit
throughout the millennium.

953
01:00:48,775 --> 01:00:51,865
As much as I know
that we like to marvel

954
01:00:51,952 --> 01:00:54,520
at these perfect relics
in their natural habitat,

955
01:00:54,607 --> 01:00:57,175
we gotta realize that
they're trying to end us.

956
01:00:57,262 --> 01:01:02,659
Now, personally, I'm not
trying to get ended yet.

957
01:01:02,746 --> 01:01:06,532
Now we don't know when
the Coast Guard is coming.

958
01:01:06,619 --> 01:01:08,882
So we have to do something.

959
01:01:10,841 --> 01:01:12,581
So we fight back.

960
01:01:12,669 --> 01:01:14,888
Exactly.

961
01:01:14,975 --> 01:01:16,803
Now the water's still shallow,

962
01:01:16,890 --> 01:01:19,371
so that means we'll see the
sharks when they get close.

963
01:01:19,458 --> 01:01:23,375
Now when they do,
we let 'em have it.

964
01:01:25,116 --> 01:01:27,335
You use that thing
a lot out on the ocean?

965
01:01:27,422 --> 01:01:29,337
What? This right here?

966
01:01:29,424 --> 01:01:31,731
More than you know.

967
01:01:31,818 --> 01:01:34,473
Used for customers
who don't pay me.

968
01:01:36,823 --> 01:01:40,000
Don't worry.
Your credit card went through.

969
01:01:49,053 --> 01:01:50,184
I got one!

970
01:01:50,271 --> 01:01:51,403
Starboard side!

971
01:01:55,929 --> 01:01:57,365
Come on, what
are you waiting for?

972
01:02:01,152 --> 01:02:02,414
Ah...

973
01:02:06,331 --> 01:02:10,291
Better be careful!
Those aren't dolphins!

974
01:02:10,378 --> 01:02:11,902
Come on, come on.

975
01:02:13,294 --> 01:02:15,122
Shatto, watch out!

976
01:02:15,209 --> 01:02:16,994
[grunts]

977
01:02:23,261 --> 01:02:26,090
[sighs]

978
01:02:26,177 --> 01:02:27,918
- That's my first mate.
- Yes, sir.

979
01:02:32,096 --> 01:02:37,057
Yeah. Great job, crew, but
the tide is still rising fast.

980
01:02:37,144 --> 01:02:39,233
We're still taking in water

981
01:02:39,320 --> 01:02:41,018
and we still haven't
gotten any help.

982
01:02:41,105 --> 01:02:44,238
So we're not out
of the hot water yet.

983
01:02:44,325 --> 01:02:47,198
Lucia, you definitely
need some medical attention

984
01:02:47,285 --> 01:02:48,416
as soon as possible.

985
01:02:48,503 --> 01:02:50,767
I'll be fine.

986
01:02:50,854 --> 01:02:52,246
Lucia? Lucia!

987
01:02:52,333 --> 01:02:54,858
- Lucia!
- Lucia, wake up!

988
01:02:54,945 --> 01:02:56,207
Wake up, kid!

989
01:02:56,294 --> 01:02:58,252
We can't let her go into shock!

990
01:03:05,259 --> 01:03:09,220
[Shatto] The tourniquet is still
holding, she should be good.

991
01:03:11,135 --> 01:03:13,485
Lucia, wake up, kid.

992
01:03:16,444 --> 01:03:17,532
Wake up.

993
01:03:18,533 --> 01:03:20,057
Lucia?

994
01:03:20,144 --> 01:03:21,406
Lucia!

995
01:03:21,493 --> 01:03:22,929
Lucia, wake up!

996
01:03:23,016 --> 01:03:24,235
Wake up, kid.

997
01:03:24,322 --> 01:03:25,845
Lucia? Wake up, kid.

998
01:03:28,021 --> 01:03:30,284
You fainted on me, kid.

999
01:03:30,371 --> 01:03:33,070
I did?

1000
01:03:33,157 --> 01:03:35,246
Yeah, too much excitement,
I guess.

1001
01:03:35,333 --> 01:03:37,814
It's okay, I'm good, I'm good.

1002
01:03:37,901 --> 01:03:39,946
Here. Take a swig of this.

1003
01:03:40,033 --> 01:03:42,296
Fighting off hungry sharks
can make you thirsty.

1004
01:03:42,383 --> 01:03:44,516
I'm gonna go clean some
shark blood off of the boat.

1005
01:03:57,572 --> 01:03:59,357
Get off!

1006
01:04:05,145 --> 01:04:07,278
Give it back!

1007
01:04:14,459 --> 01:04:15,416
Give it back!

1008
01:04:15,503 --> 01:04:17,244
He's gonna yank you under

1009
01:04:17,331 --> 01:04:18,855
if you don't just drop
that bucket in the water.

1010
01:04:18,942 --> 01:04:20,117
Yah!

1011
01:04:25,122 --> 01:04:26,645
I hate these sharks!

1012
01:04:33,217 --> 01:04:35,480
Once the water
lifts us off the sandbar,

1013
01:04:35,567 --> 01:04:37,221
we'll be targets again.

1014
01:04:39,179 --> 01:04:41,051
We'll float a bit, but we're
taking in so much water

1015
01:04:41,138 --> 01:04:42,530
that those sharks
will practically be able

1016
01:04:42,617 --> 01:04:44,228
to jump on the boat with us.

1017
01:04:44,315 --> 01:04:46,056
It's just a matter of time.

1018
01:04:50,669 --> 01:04:52,889
Am I dreaming or is that a boat?

1019
01:04:55,630 --> 01:04:57,545
That's a boat.

1020
01:04:57,632 --> 01:04:59,417
The Coast Guard.

1021
01:05:04,161 --> 01:05:06,641
Hey! S.O.S.! Over here!

1022
01:05:08,905 --> 01:05:12,691
[speaks Spanish]

1023
01:05:19,698 --> 01:05:20,568
Over here!

1024
01:05:20,655 --> 01:05:21,482
- Help!
- Hey!

1025
01:05:21,569 --> 01:05:23,920
Over here!

1026
01:05:24,007 --> 01:05:26,444
- Hey, over here!
- Over here, help!

1027
01:05:26,531 --> 01:05:28,185
Hey, over here!

1028
01:05:28,272 --> 01:05:31,275
[speaks Spanish]

1029
01:05:36,933 --> 01:05:38,630
Hey, I think we're saved!

1030
01:05:38,717 --> 01:05:39,848
I think we're saved!

1031
01:05:39,936 --> 01:05:41,372
[speaking Spanish]

1032
01:06:09,008 --> 01:06:10,488
[speaks Spanish]

1033
01:06:14,144 --> 01:06:16,102
Go grab your stuff!
Lucia, grab your stuff!

1034
01:06:16,189 --> 01:06:17,625
Shatto, just grab
the essentials!

1035
01:06:17,712 --> 01:06:18,931
Yes, yes!

1036
01:06:19,018 --> 01:06:22,021
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1037
01:06:22,108 --> 01:06:24,415
That doesn't look like any Coast
Guard vessel I've ever seen.

1038
01:06:24,502 --> 01:06:27,157
What? It's got to be.

1039
01:06:27,244 --> 01:06:29,681
Well, you're right.

1040
01:06:29,768 --> 01:06:32,510
It's definitely
not the Coast Guard.

1041
01:06:32,597 --> 01:06:34,425
I don't care who it is.
We're saved.

1042
01:06:37,210 --> 01:06:38,255
Wait a second.

1043
01:06:40,431 --> 01:06:43,086
That's...

1044
01:06:43,173 --> 01:06:44,957
That's my dad!

1045
01:06:45,044 --> 01:06:48,134
That's my dad! Dad!

1046
01:06:48,221 --> 01:06:49,788
That's them!

1047
01:06:57,361 --> 01:06:58,797
Chopper One, do you copy?

1048
01:06:58,884 --> 01:07:00,712
Go for Chopper One.

1049
01:07:00,799 --> 01:07:04,542
TK-421 is having trouble
locating the vessel.

1050
01:07:04,629 --> 01:07:06,370
Do a perimeter search
five miles out

1051
01:07:06,457 --> 01:07:08,285
and see if you
can spot anything.

1052
01:07:08,372 --> 01:07:10,635
Roger that, Office Fuentes.
I'm on my way.

1053
01:07:12,550 --> 01:07:15,205
Did you get a call sign
or a name of the vessel?

1054
01:07:15,292 --> 01:07:16,336
We did.

1055
01:07:16,423 --> 01:07:18,077
The initial report says...

1056
01:07:18,164 --> 01:07:20,993
and we just confirmed...
it's called the Jubilation.

1057
01:07:21,080 --> 01:07:23,648
- The Jubilation?
- That's correct.

1058
01:07:23,735 --> 01:07:25,171
Are you sure?

1059
01:07:25,258 --> 01:07:27,565
100%. Why?

1060
01:07:27,652 --> 01:07:29,480
I was on that boat
a couple of weeks ago.

1061
01:07:29,567 --> 01:07:32,048
I caught the biggest fish.

1062
01:07:32,135 --> 01:07:34,224
All the more reason for
you to find that vessel.

1063
01:07:34,311 --> 01:07:36,226
With food harder to find,

1064
01:07:36,313 --> 01:07:39,359
those sharks won't hesitate
to attack a boat full of fish.

1065
01:07:39,446 --> 01:07:41,405
I'll search as fast as I can.

1066
01:07:41,492 --> 01:07:43,320
All right, good.

1067
01:07:43,407 --> 01:07:45,104
You update me if
you find anything.

1068
01:07:45,191 --> 01:07:48,238
And Davila,
didn't know you fished.

1069
01:07:48,325 --> 01:07:49,978
You never asked.

1070
01:07:50,066 --> 01:07:53,112
I go out with Captain Banning
a few times a year.

1071
01:07:53,199 --> 01:07:55,680
I just don't know why
it had to be the Jubilation.

1072
01:07:55,767 --> 01:07:57,290
I mean, Banning's one of

1073
01:07:57,377 --> 01:07:58,987
the most respectful
captains out there.

1074
01:07:59,075 --> 01:08:00,511
Really?

1075
01:08:00,598 --> 01:08:02,208
Like he even took
in his first mate

1076
01:08:02,295 --> 01:08:03,688
when he had nowhere else to go.

1077
01:08:03,775 --> 01:08:05,298
Man, I hope he's okay out there.

1078
01:08:05,385 --> 01:08:07,387
Do you have any idea
where he could be?

1079
01:08:07,474 --> 01:08:10,129
Anything at all that could
help us locate that vessel?

1080
01:08:10,216 --> 01:08:12,784
Well, normally, Banning
sticks closer to the shore.

1081
01:08:12,871 --> 01:08:15,395
But the fish are moving out
further out these days.

1082
01:08:15,482 --> 01:08:18,398
So this one time,
he took us to the sandbar.

1083
01:08:18,485 --> 01:08:21,227
Man, the fish were
jumping into the boat.

1084
01:08:21,314 --> 01:08:23,708
It was like... that was
the best day of my life.

1085
01:08:23,795 --> 01:08:25,797
Do you remember
where this sandbar is?

1086
01:08:25,884 --> 01:08:28,365
I know exactly where
that sandbar is.

1087
01:08:28,452 --> 01:08:29,714
Heading that way now.

1088
01:08:37,461 --> 01:08:38,636
Lucia!

1089
01:08:38,723 --> 01:08:40,464
- Dad!
- Lucia!

1090
01:08:40,551 --> 01:08:42,553
Dad!

1091
01:08:42,640 --> 01:08:44,076
They don't know
about the sandbar.

1092
01:08:44,163 --> 01:08:45,382
Over here!

1093
01:08:45,469 --> 01:08:48,124
Lucia, are you guys okay?

1094
01:08:48,211 --> 01:08:51,127
Stop!

1095
01:08:51,214 --> 01:08:53,477
There's a sandbar over there!

1096
01:08:55,218 --> 01:08:56,480
Oh, no. Dad, please stop!

1097
01:08:56,567 --> 01:08:57,611
Dad, please stop!

1098
01:08:57,698 --> 01:09:00,484
I think they want us to stop.

1099
01:09:00,571 --> 01:09:01,833
Why stop?

1100
01:09:01,920 --> 01:09:03,269
Stop the boat! Stop the boat!

1101
01:09:03,356 --> 01:09:05,097
Watch out, brother!

1102
01:09:05,184 --> 01:09:06,794
Some extremely
hostile sharks over here!

1103
01:09:09,928 --> 01:09:13,149
The first thing I need
to know, are you okay?

1104
01:09:13,236 --> 01:09:15,281
We have one severely injured!

1105
01:09:15,368 --> 01:09:18,415
We need to get her some medical
assistance in the boat ASAP!

1106
01:09:18,502 --> 01:09:21,679
Dad, I'm okay! Dad, I'm okay!

1107
01:09:21,766 --> 01:09:26,205
Lucia, baby
why are you bleeding?

1108
01:09:26,292 --> 01:09:27,902
She's okay!

1109
01:09:27,989 --> 01:09:30,340
She just needs medical attention
to get in the boat!

1110
01:09:30,427 --> 01:09:31,602
Dad, I'm okay!

1111
01:09:31,689 --> 01:09:35,258
I was just bit. I'm fine.

1112
01:09:35,345 --> 01:09:37,129
Is that Uncle Dan?

1113
01:09:37,216 --> 01:09:40,785
- Uncle Dan?
- He's a friend of my dad's.

1114
01:09:44,397 --> 01:09:45,790
Hold on, Lucia!

1115
01:09:45,877 --> 01:09:46,878
We'll be over there
in a quick minute!

1116
01:09:46,965 --> 01:09:48,140
We're coming, baby!

1117
01:09:48,227 --> 01:09:49,315
No! No, Dad, no!

1118
01:09:49,402 --> 01:09:50,316
Wait!

1119
01:09:50,403 --> 01:09:52,144
If you come any closer,

1120
01:09:52,231 --> 01:09:53,232
you'll be trapped on
the sandbar just like we are!

1121
01:09:53,319 --> 01:09:55,365
Dude, stop!

1122
01:09:55,452 --> 01:09:57,193
Stop or you're gonna get stuck!

1123
01:09:57,280 --> 01:09:59,369
Back off. Okay, okay sit tight!

1124
01:09:59,456 --> 01:10:01,632
Slow down, slow down.

1125
01:10:05,157 --> 01:10:07,028
Why are they so aggressive?

1126
01:10:07,115 --> 01:10:10,510
These waters... they've been
chummed up by some dead sharks!

1127
01:10:10,597 --> 01:10:12,860
Dad, they've already
eaten two people

1128
01:10:12,947 --> 01:10:14,297
and they're still hungry, okay?

1129
01:10:14,384 --> 01:10:15,820
They won't leave us alone!

1130
01:10:15,907 --> 01:10:17,213
You gotta get us out of here!

1131
01:10:17,300 --> 01:10:18,910
Okay, okay!

1132
01:10:18,997 --> 01:10:20,651
Just hold on and let me see
what we got in the boat!

1133
01:10:20,738 --> 01:10:24,307
What do we got, Danny?
Do we have something?

1134
01:10:24,394 --> 01:10:26,483
What do we got in here, Dan?

1135
01:10:26,570 --> 01:10:27,484
We got this!

1136
01:10:27,571 --> 01:10:29,529
Okay! Okay.

1137
01:10:31,749 --> 01:10:33,577
I'm going to throw you this rope

1138
01:10:33,664 --> 01:10:36,841
and you tie it to the bow, okay?

1139
01:10:37,972 --> 01:10:40,497
And we pull you off the sandbar!

1140
01:10:41,933 --> 01:10:44,501
Got it!

1141
01:10:44,588 --> 01:10:45,676
Attaboy.

1142
01:10:46,677 --> 01:10:47,765
Okay, tie it to the bow!

1143
01:10:53,771 --> 01:10:55,947
How's your motor working?

1144
01:10:56,034 --> 01:10:58,950
It's dead, but if you
pull us hard enough,

1145
01:10:59,037 --> 01:11:00,778
we'll get closer to you.

1146
01:11:00,865 --> 01:11:02,258
But you gotta do it quickly

1147
01:11:02,345 --> 01:11:03,607
'cause there's a
hole in the hull

1148
01:11:03,694 --> 01:11:05,696
and we're pulling
in a lot of water!

1149
01:11:05,783 --> 01:11:09,221
Secure the rope to the boat!

1150
01:11:09,308 --> 01:11:11,702
Okay, on my signal, Dan, okay?

1151
01:11:11,789 --> 01:11:13,573
Hold tight, baby.

1152
01:11:13,660 --> 01:11:14,922
Daddy's gonna get
you out of here.

1153
01:11:15,009 --> 01:11:16,402
Papi's coming!

1154
01:11:16,489 --> 01:11:18,186
You better do it quick!

1155
01:11:18,274 --> 01:11:20,363
This boat's being held together
by a lick and a promise!

1156
01:11:24,845 --> 01:11:25,977
Now!

1157
01:11:29,459 --> 01:11:31,591
[chatters]

1158
01:11:33,898 --> 01:11:36,074
Come on, you little dinghy!
You can do it!

1159
01:11:38,816 --> 01:11:40,296
It's no use!

1160
01:11:40,383 --> 01:11:41,471
It's really wedged in there!

1161
01:11:43,908 --> 01:11:46,476
We've gotta get
off this boat, Dad!

1162
01:11:46,563 --> 01:11:47,390
We're too heavy!

1163
01:11:48,652 --> 01:11:51,829
I got a plan, Cap.

1164
01:11:51,916 --> 01:11:54,092
I'll jump out,
dislodge the front of the ship.

1165
01:11:56,921 --> 01:11:58,966
No! Shatto, no. That's suicide!

1166
01:11:59,053 --> 01:12:00,577
There's sharks still out there!

1167
01:12:02,709 --> 01:12:03,928
No. No way.

1168
01:12:04,015 --> 01:12:05,495
We've lost too much today.

1169
01:12:05,582 --> 01:12:07,018
And I'm not losing you, brother.

1170
01:12:07,105 --> 01:12:08,933
There's gotta be another option.

1171
01:12:10,413 --> 01:12:11,805
You know there isn't.

1172
01:12:11,892 --> 01:12:13,633
Shatto, I can't ask you to...

1173
01:12:13,720 --> 01:12:16,332
I'm gonna do it whether you give
me permission or not, Captain.

1174
01:12:18,856 --> 01:12:21,902
Look, the boat will be
lighter with me off it anyway.

1175
01:12:21,989 --> 01:12:24,775
And, look, you can distract them
on the other side with this.

1176
01:12:30,084 --> 01:12:31,782
All right.

1177
01:12:31,869 --> 01:12:33,827
We'll use both.

1178
01:12:33,914 --> 01:12:37,614
It might work,
but you better move fast.

1179
01:12:37,701 --> 01:12:39,790
Aye, aye, Captain.

1180
01:12:39,877 --> 01:12:41,531
You hear me?

1181
01:12:41,618 --> 01:12:43,359
And I do mean fast!

1182
01:12:45,535 --> 01:12:46,623
Aye, captain.

1183
01:13:02,639 --> 01:13:04,162
What's going on?

1184
01:13:05,642 --> 01:13:08,079
We've got a plan!

1185
01:13:08,166 --> 01:13:11,082
Just make sure when
I give you the signal,

1186
01:13:11,169 --> 01:13:12,562
you fire up your engine!

1187
01:13:18,002 --> 01:13:20,396
Trust me, captain.

1188
01:13:20,483 --> 01:13:21,484
I can do this.

1189
01:13:24,530 --> 01:13:26,402
That's my little girl
over there!

1190
01:13:26,489 --> 01:13:28,578
Hey, it's gonna work, buddy.

1191
01:13:31,189 --> 01:13:33,887
You ready for one last cast?

1192
01:13:33,974 --> 01:13:35,846
I'm ready.

1193
01:13:35,933 --> 01:13:37,587
Okay, Shatto. Ready!

1194
01:13:45,899 --> 01:13:47,118
Hey!

1195
01:13:51,427 --> 01:13:53,603
[grunting]

1196
01:14:04,091 --> 01:14:05,136
Come on!

1197
01:14:06,485 --> 01:14:07,704
Come on!

1198
01:14:07,791 --> 01:14:09,053
Don't fall apart on us now!

1199
01:14:09,140 --> 01:14:10,663
Come on!

1200
01:14:14,580 --> 01:14:17,627
Better make it quick, Shatto!
We're running out of fish!

1201
01:14:19,150 --> 01:14:22,109
Pull! Pull! We got you, hold on!

1202
01:14:22,196 --> 01:14:23,720
We got you.

1203
01:14:23,807 --> 01:14:26,723
[groans]

1204
01:14:33,207 --> 01:14:35,558
Keep going! We're almost there!

1205
01:14:35,645 --> 01:14:38,822
It's working. We're moving!

1206
01:14:38,909 --> 01:14:40,171
It's working!

1207
01:14:43,087 --> 01:14:45,742
Okay! Come on! Get back here!

1208
01:14:45,829 --> 01:14:47,831
- Move!
- Come on! Come on, Shatto!

1209
01:14:56,230 --> 01:14:57,928
Move, Shatto!

1210
01:14:58,015 --> 01:15:00,844
- Shatto, come on!
- Just move!

1211
01:15:00,931 --> 01:15:02,759
Don't look back! Move!

1212
01:15:12,899 --> 01:15:14,248
Shatto!

1213
01:15:14,335 --> 01:15:16,120
No, Banning, I cannot
lose you, either.

1214
01:15:16,207 --> 01:15:18,165
- Shatto!
- Banning, no!

1215
01:15:18,252 --> 01:15:22,126
- No!
- Shatto!

1216
01:15:24,955 --> 01:15:26,783
Come on, you know we
have to keep moving.

1217
01:15:26,870 --> 01:15:28,828
- Okay, you know it.
- Shatto...

1218
01:15:28,915 --> 01:15:30,526
Hey, hey.

1219
01:15:30,613 --> 01:15:33,093
Banning, you know we have to get
off this boat, okay?

1220
01:15:33,180 --> 01:15:34,486
We have to go.

1221
01:15:34,573 --> 01:15:36,053
Okay.. okay.

1222
01:15:43,234 --> 01:15:44,583
[grunting]

1223
01:15:47,412 --> 01:15:48,674
Come on. I got you, baby girl.

1224
01:15:48,761 --> 01:15:49,719
Come on.

1225
01:15:49,806 --> 01:15:51,895
Hold on one second!

1226
01:15:51,982 --> 01:15:54,027
I'm coming, Lucia!
I'm coming, baby!

1227
01:15:54,114 --> 01:15:55,551
Come on!

1228
01:15:55,638 --> 01:15:57,640
- We're out of time here!
- Come on.

1229
01:15:59,903 --> 01:16:01,644
I got you, I got you.

1230
01:16:01,731 --> 01:16:03,297
Banning, come on!

1231
01:16:06,126 --> 01:16:08,651
This is my boat!
I choose how it goes down!

1232
01:16:10,304 --> 01:16:13,177
Captain Banning, just leave it,
just let it go!

1233
01:16:15,005 --> 01:16:17,529
Yeah, you want this boat?

1234
01:16:17,616 --> 01:16:18,661
Come chew on this!

1235
01:16:26,146 --> 01:16:27,583
[Dan] Come on!

1236
01:16:29,976 --> 01:16:31,761
Danny! Danny!

1237
01:16:31,848 --> 01:16:34,024
Help! Uncle Dan!

1238
01:16:34,111 --> 01:16:35,155
[screaming]

1239
01:16:41,597 --> 01:16:42,772
Oh my God!

1240
01:16:42,859 --> 01:16:44,600
- No! Uncle Dan!
- He's gone!

1241
01:16:44,687 --> 01:16:47,298
Lucia, he's gone!
Honey, he's gone, baby.

1242
01:16:47,385 --> 01:16:49,039
Come back here. Come back here.

1243
01:16:49,126 --> 01:16:51,215
Come back here.

1244
01:16:52,172 --> 01:16:53,957
[shouting]

1245
01:16:54,044 --> 01:16:57,917
Banning, get your butt in here!

1246
01:16:58,004 --> 01:17:00,528
Banning! Come here!

1247
01:17:00,616 --> 01:17:02,095
Wait! Give me my tackle box!

1248
01:17:07,187 --> 01:17:08,972
Go on!

1249
01:17:09,973 --> 01:17:11,888
Get in here!

1250
01:17:11,975 --> 01:17:14,107
Wait, my leg.

1251
01:17:14,194 --> 01:17:16,762
Are you okay, honey?
Are you okay?

1252
01:17:16,849 --> 01:17:19,243
Matches. I need matches!
I need matches!

1253
01:17:19,330 --> 01:17:20,984
I quit smoking.

1254
01:17:24,727 --> 01:17:26,076
- Will this do?
- Atta girl!

1255
01:17:28,339 --> 01:17:30,167
You're gonna have to drive, hon.

1256
01:17:38,044 --> 01:17:40,090
30 years we were together!

1257
01:17:40,177 --> 01:17:41,831
To the Jubilation!

1258
01:17:42,875 --> 01:17:44,224
Goodbye, girl!

1259
01:17:44,311 --> 01:17:45,922
[grunts]

1260
01:18:00,763 --> 01:18:01,851
Thank you, Danny.

1261
01:18:12,862 --> 01:18:14,994
Whoa. Come in, Officer Fuentes.

1262
01:18:15,081 --> 01:18:16,169
There's been an explosion.

1263
01:18:16,256 --> 01:18:17,736
Copy that.

1264
01:18:17,823 --> 01:18:19,825
Can you get close enough
to find any survivors?

1265
01:18:19,912 --> 01:18:23,046
It's almost impossible to see
anything through the smoke.

1266
01:18:23,133 --> 01:18:25,048
I might have to circle
down a little bit lower.

1267
01:18:25,135 --> 01:18:27,050
You wait as long as you need to.

1268
01:18:27,137 --> 01:18:30,053
We can't leave until we know
for sure one way or the other.

1269
01:18:31,054 --> 01:18:32,490
Roger.

1270
01:18:35,972 --> 01:18:37,800
You're all right, baby.
Get ready.

1271
01:18:43,762 --> 01:18:46,634
The smoke is too thick.
I'm gonna have to circle back.

1272
01:18:46,722 --> 01:18:49,202
Do two more pass throughs
and then we'll call it.

1273
01:18:49,289 --> 01:18:50,726
Copy.

1274
01:18:51,944 --> 01:18:54,642
Come on, Banning. Where are you?

1275
01:18:54,730 --> 01:18:56,340
Come on.

1276
01:18:56,427 --> 01:18:58,298
We'll find him. Don't worry.

1277
01:18:58,385 --> 01:18:59,909
We have to.

1278
01:18:59,996 --> 01:19:01,867
Banning can't be gone,
not like this.

1279
01:19:01,954 --> 01:19:05,653
Look, I never told
you, but after my divorce,

1280
01:19:05,741 --> 01:19:07,220
I was in pretty bad shape.

1281
01:19:07,307 --> 01:19:10,746
I'd work, come home, that's it.
Just work.

1282
01:19:10,833 --> 01:19:14,053
I even canceled
my fishing trips.

1283
01:19:14,140 --> 01:19:18,754
But Banning... he found out
where I live, came to my house.

1284
01:19:18,841 --> 01:19:21,017
He refused to leave until

1285
01:19:21,104 --> 01:19:23,062
I agreed to go fishing
with him again.

1286
01:19:23,149 --> 01:19:25,935
I'm sorry.
I just can't give up on this.

1287
01:19:26,022 --> 01:19:28,764
I gotta find him.

1288
01:19:28,851 --> 01:19:30,591
Well, keep looking.

1289
01:19:30,678 --> 01:19:33,246
We won't call it in either
way until we know for sure.

1290
01:19:33,333 --> 01:19:35,379
Thank you.

1291
01:19:39,035 --> 01:19:40,471
There's gotta be
something we're missing.

1292
01:19:44,127 --> 01:19:45,215
Wait.

1293
01:19:45,302 --> 01:19:46,956
I think I see something.

1294
01:19:47,043 --> 01:19:48,392
It's a life raft!

1295
01:19:48,479 --> 01:19:50,307
Are you sure?

1296
01:19:50,394 --> 01:19:52,048
Yeah, yeah, I'm sure.

1297
01:19:52,135 --> 01:19:53,919
Yeah, that's it!

1298
01:19:54,006 --> 01:19:56,313
- Hey!
- Yes, it is!

1299
01:19:56,400 --> 01:19:58,402
It looks like
Banning's with them.

1300
01:19:58,489 --> 01:20:00,796
We got 'em! We got 'em!
That's them!

1301
01:20:00,883 --> 01:20:02,972
That is great news, officer.

1302
01:20:03,059 --> 01:20:05,452
Get TK-421 on and let them know.

1303
01:20:05,539 --> 01:20:07,150
Copy.

1304
01:20:07,237 --> 01:20:09,239
Tango-Kelo 421, do you copy?

1305
01:20:09,326 --> 01:20:10,849
Go for TK-421.

1306
01:20:10,936 --> 01:20:12,198
Hey, we found the survivors.

1307
01:20:12,285 --> 01:20:13,591
Looks to be three of them.

1308
01:20:13,678 --> 01:20:15,071
And Captain Banning's
one of them.

1309
01:20:15,158 --> 01:20:16,463
Copy that.

1310
01:20:16,550 --> 01:20:18,988
I'm mounting a rescue ASAP.

1311
01:20:19,075 --> 01:20:21,947
Congratulations.

1312
01:20:22,034 --> 01:20:22,992
We found the Jubilation
and Banning

1313
01:20:23,079 --> 01:20:24,254
and the rest of the survivors.

1314
01:20:24,341 --> 01:20:26,343
Okay.

1315
01:20:26,430 --> 01:20:28,084
Hey, a celebration
is definitely in order

1316
01:20:28,171 --> 01:20:30,434
when you get back
to the station.

1317
01:20:30,521 --> 01:20:32,523
Thank you.
I'm looking forward to it.

1318
01:20:32,610 --> 01:20:34,351
Now if you'll excuse me,

1319
01:20:34,438 --> 01:20:36,832
I have to drop a ladder and
get them out of this mess.

1320
01:20:36,919 --> 01:20:39,182
Copy that. See you soon.

1321
01:20:42,968 --> 01:20:47,103
[speaking Spanish]

1322
01:20:47,190 --> 01:20:48,974
- Down here!
- We're saved!

1323
01:20:49,061 --> 01:20:50,019
Down here!

1324
01:20:50,106 --> 01:20:52,456
Hey!

1325
01:20:52,543 --> 01:20:54,284
Yes, we are!

1326
01:20:56,199 --> 01:20:57,853
Hey!

1327
01:21:06,949 --> 01:21:09,038
Hey!

1328
01:21:09,125 --> 01:21:11,127
It's okay, baby.

1329
01:21:11,214 --> 01:21:13,042
We're going home.

1330
01:21:17,394 --> 01:21:20,223
Quick, quick, come on!

1331
01:21:20,310 --> 01:21:22,486
Okay, okay.

1332
01:21:22,573 --> 01:21:24,401
We're good, we're good.

1333
01:21:32,148 --> 01:21:35,847
Lucia:
But what about the Jubilation?

1334
01:21:35,934 --> 01:21:41,374
Banning: Oh, no big deal.

1335
01:21:41,461 --> 01:21:43,333
Lucia: No big deal?

1336
01:21:43,420 --> 01:21:47,424
Didn't you have her
for all this time?

1337
01:21:47,511 --> 01:21:50,122
That's just what
I tell my charters.

1338
01:21:50,209 --> 01:21:54,257
Truth is, I just bought
it off eBay last year.

1339
01:21:59,001 --> 01:22:03,266
All these people... gone.

1340
01:22:03,353 --> 01:22:07,096
Wyatt... and Shatto.

1341
01:22:07,183 --> 01:22:09,359
They're all just... gone.

1342
01:22:12,275 --> 01:22:13,624
But not forgotten.

1343
01:22:14,581 --> 01:22:16,322
Si.
