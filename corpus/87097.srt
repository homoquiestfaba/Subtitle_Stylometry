1
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:12,397
That shit!

2
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:22,471
- Hello!
- Hello!

3
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:33,400
- So, did you ask 'em?
- Yep. They said fine.

4
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,317
Oh, good!

5
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,311
Sure it's okay with your mom,
though, right?

6
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:39,470
Yeah, she doesn't care.
She's working.

7
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:41,391
Isn't she coming up this weekend?

8
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:43,630
I don't know.

9
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,513
So, ah, come on, how cute is he?
Spit it out.

10
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,835
- Oh, he's kind of gorgeous.
- Yeah?

11
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:53,112
He's sort of like a cousin, but not
really. He wants to be a forest ranger.

12
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:57,557
Oh, good! Well, then after dinner
we could set a fire in your room,
and he can come and rescue us.

13
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:00,234
You should've seen the look
on her face.

14
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:03,551
I never laughed so hard, I swear to God.
I just can't believe you might miss it.

15
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,192
Oh.

16
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:07,390
Hi, Gulliver.
How you doin', boy?

17
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:11,355
Hey, Pilgrim.

18
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,668
Come here.

19
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:30,239
Hey, babe.
You're such a beautiful boy.

20
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:33,756
What are you thinkin', huh?
What are you thinkin', boy?

21
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:39,678
You wanna go for a ride?

22
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:46,193
Let's go for a ride.
Come on. Come on, boy. Come on.

23
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,911
- Hello?
- It's me.

24
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,918
<i>- Hi.
- Hi.</i>

25
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,312
- So what train are you taking?
- Um, I should be in by 2:00.

26
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:44,552
<i>Okay.
You want me to pick you up?</i>

27
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,477
No, I can take a cab.
Grace go riding?

28
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,916
Mm-hmm. What do you want to do
about dinner?

29
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,037
<i>- I hadn't thought.
- I can ask to try that place
Emily says--</i>

30
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:56,476
- Oh, hang on.
- They're here, so--

31
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:01,191
I, I'll let you go. We'll figure it out
when you get here, okay?

32
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:05,273
Yeah, okay. Okay. Bye.
Hello?

33
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,280
Please! Oh, God, please!

34
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:12,113
Oh, wait. Have you seen that
stupid cereal commercial? It's like--

35
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:15,670
-And where are the paintings? It's about
her work, and we can't even see it.
-But we're trying to--

36
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:18,228
We can change the colour of the deck,
and we can move it up so then
you can see the paintings--

37
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:21,118
We need to see the paintings.
She's an artist.

38
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,758
- Have you checked on her going rate?
- Gottschalk.

39
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,678
Yes. The legal department's
on that right now.

40
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,796
<i>- David!
- Did you speak to Felton?</i>

41
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:30,075
Yes, we're suing.

42
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:33,436
<i>Well, is that absolutely necessary?
It'll just make it a bigger story.</i>

43
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:37,229
<i>-Am I on the speaker?
- David, he signed an agreement
that he wouldn't talk to the press...</i>

44
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:40,198
and now he's libelled me
by saying I faked the figures.

45
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:43,915
<i>- You're not going soft on me, are you?
- Well, nothing like a good public feud.</i>

46
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,592
Exactly!

47
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,231
- You know that kid Adam?
- Yeah.

48
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:52,915
- Mm-mmm, he's very cute!
- I, I think you'd make a good couple,
Grace.

49
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,592
- I don't think so.
- Oh, I do!

50
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:56,631
- You think he's cute?
- Eww! Are you serious?

51
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,678
- I think he's cute.
- Oh, I think he's lucky
that he lives next door to you.

52
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:01,830
- I think, I think I--
- What do you think?

53
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,791
I think you have a crush on him.

54
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:08,391
All right, let's take a shortcut.
Let's take a shortcut.

55
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:10,994
- You know, we can't even read it.
- Friday is confirmed.
- Right, okay.

56
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,272
No, no, no, no, no, no.
We have to reshoot this.

57
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:16,476
<i>- I said it
- I said that
- I said it</i>

58
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,879
<i>- It's ''that.'' It's ''that.''
- I said it</i>

59
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:21,475
- I swear to God, it's ''that.''
- It, it, it, it!
- It's ''that.''

60
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,272
- All right, fine.
Let's start again. Ready?
- All right, fine, fine, fine.

61
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:26,710
<i>All right.
I met him at a party</i>

62
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:30,395
<i>And he told me how to drive</i>

63
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:33,358
<i>He said he'd like to do it backwards</i>

64
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,351
<i>I said it
It</i>

65
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,670
- Come on.
-Judith.

66
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:40,439
<i>I said it
It!</i>

67
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:43,550
Come on!

68
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:47,513
Gulliver. Gulliver, up!
Up, Gulliver! Whoa!

69
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,830
-Judith!
- Hey! No! No, no, no!

70
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:52,150
Grace, look out!

71
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:56,153
- Pilgrim!Judith,Judith!
- Grace!

72
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,478
Hello!

73
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,870
No!

74
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:33,230
Gulliver!

75
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:37,359
Gulliver, stop!
Hold it, Gulliver!

76
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:43,630
Gulliver! Come on!

77
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,591
Robert.

78
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:41,231
Judith's dead.

79
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,675
And what about Grace?

80
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:47,632
- She's in pretty bad shape.
- It's a multiple trauma.

81
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:50,598
- Where is she?
- She's still in the O.R.

82
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:54,349
- O.R.? What for?
- I-It's just-- It's--

83
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:58,797
It's a mid-shaft, tib-fib fracture
with a vascular compromise, meaning
the blood supply to the lower leg--

84
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:01,877
They think they have to take part
of the leg off.

85
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:10,078
Which leg?

86
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:14,310
T-The right leg.

87
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:40,831
Oh,Jesus.

88
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:45,439
Okay.

89
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:54,356
Just take it easy.

90
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:58,115
This is gonna be tough on both of us.

91
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,799
So let's not make it any harder
than it has to be.

92
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,756
Judith.

93
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:58,713
- That bag's almost empty.
- Oh, they'll be in to change it.

94
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:02,554
If you leave it up to these people--
Excuse me.

95
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:05,393
- My daughter needs a new I.V.
- Yes, I know. We have her down.

96
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:08,040
Well, I'd like it
taken care of now, please.

97
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:10,355
You have to stay on top
of these people constantly.

98
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,351
I'm sorry.

99
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:19,717
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

100
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:25,391
We really should let her get some rest,
and I do have to change the bandage.

101
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:29,473
You can come back in a couple of hours
and see how she's doing.

102
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:55,359
Mrs MacLean? Mrs MacLean,
you have a call on line two.
You can take it right there.

103
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:01,039
- Hello?
- Annie, it's Liz. How's Grace?

104
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:05,474
Her leg was very damaged,
and they had to remove it.

105
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:09,472
Oh, God. Annie, I'm so sorry.

106
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:12,114
Listen, I, I know
that you're being hit with a lot now...

107
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:16,990
and it's hard to think
about anything else,
but I have to talk to you about Pilgrim.

108
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,276
<i>Hello?</i>

109
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:23,151
Yeah, I'm here.

110
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:26,357
<i>I've never seen an animal
with these injuries still breathing.</i>

111
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:28,954
I'd like your permission
to put him down.

112
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:34,194
<i>- It's, it's really the best thing--
- Uh, I-- Y-- Uh--
You mean shoot him?</i>

113
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:37,829
<i>-Annie.
- Well, um--</i>

114
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:41,594
Um, look, Liz.
The doctor's here right now...

115
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:44,069
and I, I can't make this decision
on my own.

116
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:46,793
<i>-Annie, I understand that,
but I have to know--
- Uh, just do what you can.</i>

117
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:49,474
<i>- Okay?
- Annie, no matter what I do,
this horse will never be the same.</i>

118
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:52,637
Well, look, I, I, I, I just don't know.
It's Grace's horse, so when she--

119
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:57,111
- It's not right to make it suffer.
- I cannot deal with this now, Liz.

120
00:13:57,200 --> 00:14:00,317
I-If you need a yes or a no,
then don't do it.

121
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:05,520
Okay? Just, just, just, j-just do
what you can for him, okay?

122
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,192
Right.

123
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:11,756
Animal should be put down.
Anybody can see that.

124
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:14,953
What did he say?

125
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,514
Nothing.
He's just going off duty.

126
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:23,512
Well! That's important information, huh?

127
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,352
Christ.

128
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,556
Doctors, huh?

129
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:36,077
I'm gonna get to know all
the nurses' names.

130
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:44,716
It's, it's good to know their names.

131
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:59,077
- I'll go get some of her things.
- I'll go.

132
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:04,069
No! I'll go.
You stay, in case she wakes up.

133
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:17,998
You guys go on ahead.
I'll be up by Christmas.

134
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:24,030
Oh, I meant to tell you. I got
those tickets for the Knicks game.

135
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,559
Good.

136
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:28,757
- Wanna come, Annie?
- No. Why don't you go with a friend,
Grace?

137
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:30,671
Yeah.

138
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:36,439
Wanna eat something else, honey?
We can order out something else.

139
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:39,273
No, I'm just not that hungry.
That's all.

140
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:41,276
Well, you should try to eat anyway.
It's the only way you're gonna--

141
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:44,033
I said I wasn't hungry.

142
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:47,709
- Wanna watch some television?
- I think she should finish first.
- Maybe.

143
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:52,754
I just-- I-- I can't.

144
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:55,912
- Here.
- I'm sorry.

145
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:58,793
No, Dad! I got it. Got it.

146
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:01,070
Sorry.

147
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:13,909
- You've got to stop doing that.
- What?

148
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:18,512
Helping her all the time.

149
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:22,479
Running to her every time she trips,
anticipating her.

150
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:26,519
You know, Annie,
this didn't just happen to you.

151
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:47,473
Hi, Grace.

152
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:02,199
I don't care what he told you.
The man's a liar.

153
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,430
He's a actor, for God's sake.

154
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,636
He'd do anything to get a cover.

155
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:36,154
Gracie, what happened?

156
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:40,592
It doesn't matter.
I just--

157
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:43,319
I don't wanna come back.
That's all.

158
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:47,634
Well, what are you gonna do? I mean,
you have to go to school, sweetheart.

159
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:49,756
I said no!

160
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:53,515
I don't want to come back.
That's it. I wanna go home.

161
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:58,715
Grace, listen to me. Hmm?

162
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:02,076
Your leg is just healing, and you have
to give the rest of you time as well.

163
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:07,035
Is that your version of a pep talk?

164
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:12,158
Well, you're not staying home all day,
feeling sorry for yourself.

165
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:14,674
You're gonna get up,
and you're gonna figure this out.

166
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:16,591
Fine.

167
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:20,076
It's still early.
What's your next class?

168
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:23,871
Gym.

169
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:42,789
<i>Appears to be an excellent jump.
Head and hands, eyes, perfect.</i>

170
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:46,753
<i>Pilgrim moves with absolute confidence
at the command of Miss MacLean.</i>

171
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:26,796
- What is it, sweetheart?
- I wanna see Pilgrim.

172
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:54,080
- Hello.
- Hi.
- Hi.

173
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:59,758
It's so good to see you.
How are you doing?

174
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,916
- She's doing just great.
Aren't you, kiddo?
- I'm fine.

175
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,072
Watch your step.

176
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:08,152
Mind how you go.
It's muddy back there.

177
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,958
Back there?

178
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:14,556
W-Well, what do you, what do you mean?
Why isn't he in the barn
with the other horses?

179
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:22,755
Well, Grace, you see...

180
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:27,072
Pilgrim just isn't the same horse
that he used to be.

181
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:30,197
As a matter of fact, maybe now's
not the best time for you to see him.

182
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:34,028
I really wanna see him.

183
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:58,352
Can you open it, please?

184
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:10,993
Hey!

185
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:14,237
Hello, beautiful boy.

186
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,639
- No! No!
- Grace.
- Oh, God, no, no, please.

187
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:27,429
- No, Grace.
- No, no, no, no. Leave me alone!

188
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:31,234
Here. Grace. Grace!

189
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:34,517
Mr MacLean, I'm so sorry.

190
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:40,600
- Dad, why didn't you tell me?
- I'm so sorry.

191
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:52,113
You should've told her, Annie.
This animal is beyond help.

192
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:57,952
Annie, can I have your permission now
to put him down?

193
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:02,999
No.

194
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,356
And get me every publication on riding,
racing, breeding.

195
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:11,318
Everything.
Medical publications as well.

196
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:14,039
Veterinarian journals. And tell them
it's me, and I want it now.

197
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:17,550
- Hold on, hold on. Gottschalk.
- I'll call him back.

198
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:19,750
- He says he's on his way
to the airport, he really needs--
- Lucy, I'll call him back.

199
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:22,268
I'll call him back.
Just get me what I want.

200
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:00,430
''A million years before man...

201
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:03,239
''they grazed the vast
and empty plains...

202
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:05,151
''living by voices
only they could hear.

203
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:11,671
''They first came to know man
as the hunted knows the hunter...

204
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:20,758
''for long before he used horses
for his labours...

205
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:25,394
''he killed them for meat.

206
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:30,072
''The alliance with man
would forever be fragile...

207
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:36,312
''for the fear he'd struck
into their hearts...

208
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,675
''was too deep to be dislodged.

209
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:42,830
''Since that Neolithic moment...

210
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:46,435
''when a horse was first haltered...

211
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:50,069
''there were those among men
who understood this.

212
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:55,075
''They could see
into the creature's soul...

213
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:57,515
''and soothe the wounds
they found there.

214
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:04,833
''The secrets uttered softly
into troubled ears.

215
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:11,316
These men were known
as the Whisperers.''

216
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,116
It's perfectly shot,
perfectly cropped...

217
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:21,355
perfectly laid out,
and I am so bloody bored.

218
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:23,550
Start again.

219
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:27,315
Thank you.
Would you excuse me for a moment?

220
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:29,231
Yes.

221
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:36,116
- Hello?
- Yeah, this is Tom Booker.
I got a message you called.

222
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:40,193
<i>Oh, hello, Mr Booker.
It's Annie MacLean from Cover.</i>

223
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:42,191
You know, the magazine.

224
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:46,356
Um, well, thank you
for returning my call.

225
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:48,954
<i>- Is there something
I can do for you, ma'am?
- Yes, yes.</i>

226
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:52,828
I read this article about what you do
for people with horse problems.

227
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:56,196
Well, truth is, I help horses
with people problems.

228
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:58,236
Well, whichever way
you want to put it.

229
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:02,836
Uh, this article said that you were,
you were a, a horse whisperer.

230
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:07,396
Oh, they said that, huh?
A whisperer. Hmm.

231
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:10,358
And I was hoping that you'd come
to New York...

232
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:13,198
and take a look at my daughter's horse
and possibly do some--

233
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:16,869
Ma'am, I'm sorry, but I'm,
I'm afraid you've misunderstood
whatever it is you read.

234
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:19,514
Because that's not exactly what I do.
I mostly conduct clinics, you see, and--

235
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:22,239
Well, could you come to New York
just for the day?

236
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:24,151
<i>- It's only a few hours by plane.
- And I'm not doin' them now.</i>

237
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:27,073
I'm on my way to Montana where I have
a ranch to take care of.

238
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:29,958
Well, I'd pay your fare, of course.
Uh, first class.

239
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:32,759
Ma'am, first class to Montana
is a waste of good money.

240
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:36,237
Well, if you could just give me a time
when you'd be available.

241
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:39,477
Say, am I, am I being too polite here
when I say ''no'' in Nevada?

242
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:41,278
<i>Does that mean ''yes'' where you are?</i>

243
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:43,954
<i>Look, I'm really sorry for your
situation, but there's nothing I can do.</i>

244
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:47,237
You just called the wrong person is all.
I'm sure there's some fine horse doctors
back east.

245
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:49,151
No, but I don't want a horse doctor.

246
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:52,232
<i>- I want, I want you.
- So I, I hope everything goes okay
with you and your horse.</i>

247
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:54,840
<i>- Well, but you see, it's not my horse.
- So, so, goodbye now.</i>

248
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:04,910
Grace?

249
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,036
Grace, it's Mom.

250
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:16,668
Grace?

251
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:19,795
Grace?

252
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:25,594
Are you all right?

253
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:37,075
- I've decided about Pilgrim.
- Oh.

254
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:39,071
I think we should put him down.

255
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:43,353
It's not fair to let him suffer.

256
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:48,949
- Well, I think that's a very--
- Maybe they should put me down, too.

257
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:53,632
- What?
- I'm not much use anymore.

258
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:58,510
You're getting a fax.

259
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:20,114
- You're up late.
- Is it?

260
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,792
- How was the dinner?
- Is Grace asleep?

261
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:23,711
- Yeah, I think so.
- Nothing we haven't heard before.

262
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:26,678
Just louder this time. That's all.

263
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:31,834
- So why'd you go?
- Well, one of us had to.

264
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:34,354
They're still our friends, Annie.

265
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:45,317
Listen, I had a thought.
What do you think
we go someplace warm, the three of us?

266
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:49,598
Bermuda or the Bahamas or--
What?

267
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:54,750
Mmm, nothing.

268
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:56,910
No, I just don't know if Bermuda
would be such a good idea.

269
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:01,551
- Grace would have to wear
summer dresses or shorts.
- Oh, yeah, of course, of course.

270
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:08,669
What is it?

271
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:14,433
I want to take Pilgrim out to see this
horse guy. Drive him out to Montana.

272
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:19,435
- No, I'm serious.
- Now, wait a minute.

273
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:23,632
- I thought you said you didn't like
the way he sounded on the phone.
- Well, I didn't.

274
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:26,672
- I want to take Grace with me.
- You're kidding!

275
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:28,870
Liz'll find me a trailer.
We can stay at motels along the way.

276
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:31,036
- What, you made arrangements already?
- No, I just checked out a few things.
You know.

277
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:35,033
- Wait a minute. Drive a crazed horse
all the way to Montana with--
- Oh, he's not crazed, Robert.

278
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:37,429
- Don't exaggerate.
- No, I can't just pack up and leave.

279
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:40,193
- Well, I'm not asking you to.
I'll do it.
- By yourself? How?

280
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:43,113
- You can't take care of Pilgrim.
- He'll be sedated.

281
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:45,276
- I do know a thing or two about horses.
- What about the magazine?

282
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:47,476
I'm in charge.
I can oversee things from Montana.

283
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,397
- I can take my fax, my computer.
- Oh, you're in charge.

284
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,795
Well, what about Grace? The doctor says
she needs stability and security.

285
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:54,235
Well, I can't say he's being
all that effective with her.

286
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:58,359
- Are you a psychiatrist?
He says it takes time.
- Well, I don't care what he says!

287
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:00,590
I cannot sit here and pretend
everything's gonna be all right.

288
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:02,636
- I am not pretending. I am trusting.
- We have to do something, Robert.

289
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:06,992
- Other people know more
about this than we do.
- We are losing-- We are losing her!

290
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:10,794
I don't care what the doctors say.
They don't know her.

291
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:14,913
I don't care
if this doesn't sound rational.
Nobody is suggesting anything better!

292
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:19,314
I, I can't explain it, Robert.
I just have this feeling.

293
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:21,709
I just know it's the right thing.

294
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,597
Why, Annie?

295
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:33,240
I just know it.

296
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:41,589
Does this, uh, cowboy vet
know that you're coming?

297
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,592
Yeah.

298
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:52,077
What if Grace doesn't wanna go?

299
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:54,111
She will if you think she should.

300
00:30:57,640 --> 00:31:01,428
- And you think it's best
if I don't come.
- No, that's not what I said.

301
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:03,556
Daddy?

302
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:07,959
I don't wanna go.

303
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,709
Straight back. Come on.
A little closer. A little more.

304
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:15,319
Watch it. Get behind him.

305
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:19,036
Hold it! Get back! Hold it.

306
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:20,951
- Watch it!
- There he goes, Eddie!

307
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:24,589
- Why don't you get inside and--
- Lady, we're doing the best we can!

308
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:30,272
- It's the only way to load
this kind of horse.
- Keep trying.

309
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:33,591
- Maybe we should give him
another sedative.
- We did.

310
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:36,312
Get the gate! Get the gate!

311
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:39,153
Let's get out of here!
Hold that door!

312
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:47,959
You got a gun, just in case?

313
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,877
Of course not.

314
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:51,956
That's probably best.

315
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:55,316
You may want to shoot yourself
halfway to Ohio.

316
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:06,037
Grace, are you hungry?
Do you want to stop for lunch?

317
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:08,156
I don't care.

318
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:14,035
I want to find a place before
it gets dark. What do you think?

319
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:18,993
- Grace?
- Doesn't matter.

320
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:20,917
Okay, Lucy, look.
This is what I'll do.

321
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,514
I'll get to the next motel,
see if they have a fax and then--

322
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:28,036
Oh, wait, hang on. Uh--
I gotta go, okay? Later.

323
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:37,237
Grace, do you want
to put your music on up here?

324
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:44,275
Grace.

325
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:47,318
Do you want to put your music on
up here?

326
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:55,512
<i>And when you purchase
your Eureka World Deluxe Vac--</i>

327
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:59,354
<i>Here the agricultural markets
and farm news headlines continue to--</i>

328
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:01,271
<i>Insecticide for small grains.</i>

329
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:03,351
<i>Important to always read
and follow label instructions--</i>

330
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:06,796
<i>This here man was rejuvenated
in the grace of the Lord.</i>

331
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:08,751
<i>He was washed.</i>

332
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:19,828
Mmm, Grace, look at this.

333
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:24,593
Do you wanna see that?

334
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:27,717
- I don't care.
- ''I don't care.''

335
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:35,314
Oh, it'll be fun. You haven't seen
any of the sights yet. It's history.

336
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:38,039
When I was 1 3, I used to love
doing things like this.

337
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:40,953
Oh, you were never 1 3, Mom.

338
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:49,797
Oh.

339
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:55,957
Great idea, Mom. Now what?

340
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:01,152
- How long is this gonna go on?
- What?

341
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:05,399
You know what I mean.

342
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:12,188
Do you want us to go back home?
Is that what you want?

343
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:14,874
What are you asking me for?
You didn't ask me if I wanted to come
in the first place.

344
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:16,791
Now I get to decide? Sorry.

345
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:21,710
Do you know who I'm doing this for?
I'm doing this for you.

346
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:25,594
Bullshit! It's all about you, about
you deciding, about you being right!

347
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:27,671
-It's like we work for you or somethin'!
-I don't believe this!

348
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:30,274
- How come Daddy didn't come, huh?
- What do you mean?

349
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:32,999
You know everything.
You figure it out.

350
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:36,629
- Your father had to work.
- Yeah, right!

351
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:39,917
- Would you please stop acting like
you know what you're talking about?
- You are amazing, you know?

352
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:42,838
I mean, you act like I don't even live
in that house anymore.

353
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:45,553
What, you think
I don't know what's going on?
You think I'm still five years old!

354
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:47,875
- When you act like this, you are.
- How long are we gonna be away, huh?

355
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:50,269
- I don't know. I don't know.
- Yeah, well, what if this guy
can't do anything, huh?

356
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:52,920
I don't know!

357
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:57,078
I don't have all the answers.

358
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:59,031
No, you just act like you do.

359
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:38,315
- You okay, ma'am?
- Yeah, I'm, I'm fine.

360
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:40,828
That young lady's gettin'
a little worried.

361
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:42,911
Oh, sorry. Sorry.

362
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:52,549
- Good night, ma'am.
- Good night.

363
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:03,276
You buckled up?

364
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:07,634
- Are you cold?
- A little.

365
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:21,630
<i>You may have seen the

00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:35,914
<i>Well, looks like lots of precipitation,

371

376
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:01,388
Gee, this place looks like fun.

377
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:08,599
- Don't they believe in signs
around here?
- What would they say?

378
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:12,679
- ''Ten miles to Big Rock,
twenty miles to Bigger Rock''?
- No.

379
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:15,399
- Great trip, Mom.
I'm having so much fun.
- I think I should turn here.

380
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:20,548
Oh, yeah, those rocks over there,
much more interesting.

381
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:43,478
Can we take a look at Bronty's foal
when we're done here, Dad?

382
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:45,397
Sure, as long as she don't mind.

383
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:48,836
There's this kid at school says
we should have imprint-trained him.

384
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:52,117
Says if you do it soon as they're born,
makes 'em real easy to handle later on.

385
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:54,151
That's what some folks say.

386
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:57,556
There's this thing on the TV
about a guy who does it with geese.

387
00:40:57,600 --> 00:41:01,115
He has this aeroplane,
and these baby geese all grow up
thinking it's their mom.

388
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:05,193
And he flies it, and they just follow.
You hear about that, Uncle T?

389
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:07,231
Yeah. Heard about it.

390
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:09,834
Well, what do you think
about all that stuff?

391
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:13,634
Well, I'll tell ya,Joey,
it might be all right for geese to
grow up thinkin' they're aeroplanes...

392
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:16,188
but horses, as far as I can tell,
can't fly.

393
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:20,437
We expecting company?

394
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:30,760
- You know who it is?
- Nope.

395
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:37,795
- Mr Booker?
- Yeah?
- Yeah?

396
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:39,791
Tom Booker?

397
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:59,955
Annie MacLean from New York.
We talked on the phone.

398
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:04,357
I had a little bit of a hard time
finding the place. There are no signs.

399
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:07,671
Oh, there are plenty of signs,
just not many of them printed.

400
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:10,877
Why do I get the impression
that you're just not driving through?

401
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:16,113
I want you to take a look at my horse.
Now, it won't take long.

402
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:18,515
And if you still feel the same way,
then I'm sure I can find--

403
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:20,511
You thinkin' about personally
driving me back east?

404
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:24,434
Oh, no, no, no. No, I brought him along,
and my daughter, too.

405
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:27,313
We're at, we're at the Lazy J Motel.

406
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:31,273
- You hauled him all the way out here?
- Well, yeah.

407
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:34,278
I had a trailer. It's not like
I made him run alongside the car.

408
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:37,079
- By yourself?
- Mm-hmm.

409
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:41,029
Well, ma'am, I appreciate the pains
that you've obviously gone through--

410
00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:44,117
Look, please don't do
the ''Shucks, ma'am'' thing again.

411
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:47,875
I have just driven a few thousand miles
for a few minutes of your time.

412
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:50,076
I have brought him
all the way out here.

413
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:52,720
Just take a look at him.
If you still feel the same way...

414
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:55,832
I will be on the road by morning, and
you'll never hear from me again, okay?

415
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:57,592
Deal?

416
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:02,040
We're at the Lazy J Motel.
Whenever you're free.

417
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:06,353
You don't have to call.

418
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:10,997
Jesus!

419
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:24,518
- No, this is what you call the boonies.
- Mom, the door.

420
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:26,795
No. No, not really.

421
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:30,276
No services,
and there's one doctor in town.

422
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:32,749
But I managed to find a therapist
for Grace.

423
00:43:32,840 --> 00:43:34,910
I had to drive, like, two hours.

424
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:39,078
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
Did they get the colour corrections?

425
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:43,637
- Yeah?
- Uh, I'm Tom Booker.
Is your mother around?

426
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:46,035
She's on the phone.
She'll be right out.

427
00:43:46,120 --> 00:43:51,114
- Could I--
- Mom, there's a cowboy here.

428
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:55,915
This is not Gottschalk's business.
Why is he interfering with this?

429
00:43:55,960 --> 00:43:57,916
I told him I'd take care of it.

430
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:01,595
No. I told him I'd take care of it,
and I will take care of it.

431
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:04,240
I just have to get myself settled here.

432
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:08,956
Well, um, put it in a memo,
and I'll sign it.

433
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:13,790
- This your first time in Montana?
- Oh, no! Really?

434
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:17,509
Uh, it's completely ridiculous.
It's completely ridiculous.

435
00:44:17,560 --> 00:44:19,835
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah. I can imagine.

436
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:22,388
I can imagine. They are?

437
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:25,552
<i>Then why did you go to meet him,
alone, secretly?</i>

438
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:28,398
<i>-All dressed up?
- That's, that's funny.</i>

439
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:32,115
No, really?
I can't believe that.

440
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:36,751
- Is she gonna be long?
- Probably. She's on the phone
23 hours a day.

441
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:40,797
- What does she do?
- She's an editor.

442
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:43,189
An editor? Ah, ah, yeah.

443
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:47,512
Just in case she hasn't told you,
which she probably hasn't...

444
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:49,591
I don't wanna be a part of this,
okay?

445
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:52,433
Mm-hmm. Thank you.

446
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:57,950
Hi. Sorry about that.

447
00:44:58,040 --> 00:45:01,749
Grace, this is Mr Booker.
Did you look at Pilgrim yet?

448
00:45:01,840 --> 00:45:03,796
I was gonna take that look now.

449
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:06,832
Would you like me to come with you?
I have to run over to the office
and give Mr Peterson a cheque.

450
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:08,518
- Doesn't matter.
- Grace?

451
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:12,639
Do you wanna come with us,
take a look at Pilgrim?

452
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:15,075
- Probably best she stay behind anyway.
- Okay.

453
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:27,475
- Howdy, Lester.
- Howdy.

454
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:30,080
- Goin' to see that horse?
- Yeah, I thought I might.

455
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:34,551
Well, I hope you got insurance.
That dirty son of a bitch.

456
00:47:54,440 --> 00:47:56,829
Well, you're the closest
anyone's ever gotten.

457
00:48:09,560 --> 00:48:11,391
I have to be honest with you.

458
00:48:11,480 --> 00:48:14,199
I still feel you've made
a long trip for nothin'.

459
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,594
But before I even think about it...

460
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:28,639
I need to know somethin' right now.

461
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:30,915
And it's a question for Grace.

462
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:34,310
You see, when I work with a horse,
it's no good just me doin' it.

463
00:48:34,360 --> 00:48:36,476
- The owner's gotta be involved, too.
- Well, that'll be a little complicated.

464
00:48:36,560 --> 00:48:39,916
You can make it as complicated
or as easy as you like.

465
00:48:39,960 --> 00:48:42,599
But she's the one that's gonna
be ridin' him. Am I right?

466
00:48:44,920 --> 00:48:46,592
Hey? Right?

467
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:50,755
Now, here's the deal.

468
00:48:50,840 --> 00:48:53,308
I don't know that I can do anything.

469
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:55,675
But I'm prepared to give it a go,
if you'll help.

470
00:48:57,680 --> 00:49:00,752
- Oh, you have a problem with that?
- Isn't it, like, obvious?

471
00:49:02,040 --> 00:49:04,600
Not to me.
Either you want to or you don't.

472
00:49:04,680 --> 00:49:09,071
- Look, I'll talk to--
- Excuse me. With all due respect,
this is her decision, not yours.

473
00:49:10,920 --> 00:49:15,311
Now, I don't wanna waste
anybody's time here, mostly mine.

474
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:20,273
Well, nothin' else to do around here.

475
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:26,235
That's not good enough.
I can't help you.

476
00:49:29,360 --> 00:49:31,157
What do I have to do?

477
00:49:31,240 --> 00:49:34,516
I said, what do I have to do?

478
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:39,358
Well, what does she want?

479
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:42,830
- Does she want you to take care
of her horse?
- Somethin' like that.

480
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:45,872
- And they're stayin' in a motel?
- The Lazy J.
Can I have some butter please?

481
00:49:45,960 --> 00:49:51,239
- Not exactly a tourist stop.
- Well, well, what about the girl?
Doesn't she go to school?

482
00:49:51,320 --> 00:49:55,472
- I don't know.
- You know, I just think she's got
a lot of nerve showin' up here.

483
00:49:55,520 --> 00:49:58,318
Draggin' that, you know, poor animal
and that child all the way--

484
00:49:58,360 --> 00:50:02,831
Honey, don't eat with your fingers.
Frank, don't you think
she's got a lot of nerve?

485
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:06,350
Well, hell, I don't know. According to
Tom, she's a pretty determined woman.

486
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:08,391
She must've thought it was worth it.

487
00:50:08,440 --> 00:50:12,797
Yeah. Well, I guess they'll want
feedin', bein' out here all day long.

488
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:16,839
- I don't think they'll expect that.
- What, they gonna drive 40 miles into
town every time they want a hamburger?

489
00:50:16,920 --> 00:50:19,957
- Mixed salad.
- What?

490
00:50:20,040 --> 00:50:22,918
Well, I believe women from New York
eat mixed salads.

491
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:24,991
- Ain't that right, Tom?
- I believe so.

492
00:50:25,080 --> 00:50:29,392
Well, that's just what we need!
A vegetarian from New York
on our cattle ranch.

493
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:34,637
<i>A Great Traveller, interested,
not merely a good one...</i>

494
00:50:34,680 --> 00:50:36,750
<i>is a kind of introspective.</i>

495
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:38,677
<i>As she covers the ground outwardly...</i>

496
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:42,679
<i>so she advances towards fresh
interpretations of herself, inwardly.</i>

497
00:50:42,760 --> 00:50:45,194
<i>And this is the quality
which lends Frea Starks'books...</i>

498
00:50:45,240 --> 00:50:49,119
<i>the memorable poetic density
which is their special cachet.</i>

499
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:52,272
<i>Moreover, it is this quality
which makes them as fresh and strike--</i>

500
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:44,115
You're at a good place to quit.

501
00:52:44,200 --> 00:52:46,634
Oh, I got him movin' out a bit.
That's about it.

502
00:52:46,680 --> 00:52:49,433
It's still a long ways away
from gettin' a leg over him.

503
00:53:09,080 --> 00:53:10,559
Well, we're movin' along.

504
00:54:04,840 --> 00:54:07,115
What's he doing?

505
00:54:13,600 --> 00:54:16,433
Is this some kind
of physical therapy?

506
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:25,235
Hello? Hello?

507
00:54:25,320 --> 00:54:27,675
What? No, you're breaking up.

508
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,230
Hold on. Hold on.

509
00:54:32,280 --> 00:54:35,590
Don't start a fight with him.
Joey, give me your rope.

510
00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:39,070
Just to pull him back.
We'll never get him outta there.
Let me go in after him.

511
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:08,509
Mr Booker, I'm really not comfortable
with you taking these kind of risks.

512
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:27,280
- Oh, God!
- Hey, hey! Pilgrim!

513
00:55:27,360 --> 00:55:29,396
Let him go!

514
00:55:29,480 --> 00:55:31,436
Let him go.

515
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:13,715
Does that hurt you?

516
00:56:17,240 --> 00:56:19,117
Only when I kick somebody.

517
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:25,991
Don't you go to school?

518
00:56:28,080 --> 00:56:30,435
Taking a break.

519
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:32,038
Don't you?

520
00:56:32,080 --> 00:56:35,789
School term's out early for us
so we can work the ranch.

521
00:56:51,120 --> 00:56:53,350
Look at him out in the pasture.

522
00:56:53,400 --> 00:56:56,949
He must've been a big,
beautiful-lookin' horse.

523
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:01,520
How was he to ride?

524
00:57:05,640 --> 00:57:08,552
Excuse me.
I've got chores to look after.

525
00:57:26,320 --> 00:57:28,276
Are we in the way?

526
00:57:35,720 --> 00:57:37,870
Should we leave?

527
00:57:51,120 --> 00:57:53,111
I guess we'll go then.

528
01:00:03,160 --> 01:00:05,515
From now on,
leave your phone somewhere else.

529
01:00:16,800 --> 01:00:20,634
Miss MacLean, would you and
your daughter like to stay for dinner?

530
01:00:25,080 --> 01:00:28,834
Joe, take off your hat at the table.
I don't want to say it again.

531
01:00:36,280 --> 01:00:38,430
Uh, dear Lord...

532
01:00:38,480 --> 01:00:41,153
we are humbly thankful
for these gifts...

533
01:00:41,200 --> 01:00:45,193
for the blessings on our home,
our family and our guests.

534
01:00:46,560 --> 01:00:48,232
And bless those that aren't
as fortunate.

535
01:00:48,280 --> 01:00:50,919
Bless all God's creatures. Amen.

536
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:53,468
- Amen.
- Amen.

537
01:00:53,560 --> 01:00:56,438
- Like some roast beef?
- Looks great. Thanks.

538
01:01:00,600 --> 01:01:02,511
Thank you.

539
01:01:12,320 --> 01:01:14,356
- Want some milk?
- Yeah. Thanks.

540
01:01:21,040 --> 01:01:24,271
Ol' Hank got us
a couple more men...

541
01:01:24,320 --> 01:01:26,550
to move the cattle.

542
01:01:26,640 --> 01:01:29,598
And what kind of cattle
do you raise, Mr Booker?

543
01:01:29,680 --> 01:01:32,558
Well, we run a mixed herd,
but mostly Black Baldies.

544
01:01:32,600 --> 01:01:34,192
And, uh, what're, what're those?

545
01:01:34,240 --> 01:01:37,789
- Black Angus Herefords
instead of straight Herefords.
- Oh, Black Angus.

546
01:01:37,880 --> 01:01:39,393
- There you go.
- Of course.

547
01:01:39,480 --> 01:01:41,948
And, uh, what's,
what's the difference?

548
01:01:42,040 --> 01:01:45,555
- Well, they suit the weather better.
- And their utters are black
instead of pink.

549
01:01:45,640 --> 01:01:48,074
They don't get burnt
with the sun bouncin' off the snow.

550
01:01:48,120 --> 01:01:51,635
- They make good mothers.
- Our daddy raised straight Herefords.

551
01:01:51,680 --> 01:01:54,592
You know, that's interesting. Um--

552
01:01:54,680 --> 01:01:57,478
I've always wondered every time I,
you know, when I go into a restaurant...

553
01:01:57,560 --> 01:02:00,996
what's the difference between a regular
steak and a Black Angus steak?

554
01:02:01,080 --> 01:02:04,390
I can never taste the difference,
but I could swear that one
was more tender than the other.

555
01:02:05,880 --> 01:02:09,429
I didn't know there was
that much difference between the cows.

556
01:02:09,520 --> 01:02:11,909
Of course, I've never been on
a cow farm before.

557
01:02:11,960 --> 01:02:14,269
Seems to me that the bulls
have the best of the time.

558
01:02:14,360 --> 01:02:19,229
Just laying around the fields,
waiting for somebody to come along
and ask them to do their work.

559
01:02:19,320 --> 01:02:23,950
You get born a bull,
got a 90% chance of getting castrated,
served up as hamburger.

560
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,434
So on balance,
I reckon I'd choose being a cow.

561
01:02:33,800 --> 01:02:36,109
Yeah.

562
01:02:36,200 --> 01:02:39,351
- Hey, young man.
- You get back up to bed!

563
01:02:44,200 --> 01:02:47,033
So how's the Lazy ''J''
holding up for you?

564
01:02:47,120 --> 01:02:49,429
Oh, it's fine.

565
01:02:49,520 --> 01:02:52,080
I still can't get used to how dark
it gets around here, though.

566
01:02:52,160 --> 01:02:56,233
Every time I leave the ranch,
I hold my breath
until I can see the motel.

567
01:02:56,320 --> 01:02:59,392
Well, by golly,
that's a lot of drive time.

568
01:03:00,840 --> 01:03:04,833
You know, Tom, while you're working
on that horse of theirs...

569
01:03:04,880 --> 01:03:08,156
Annie and Grace should move
into the old creek house.

570
01:03:15,320 --> 01:03:19,598
Nobody's usin' it. It's silly for her
to be driving back and forth...

571
01:03:19,680 --> 01:03:21,989
when she, she don't know her way around
that well.

572
01:03:22,080 --> 01:03:24,469
Well, that's very kind of you,
but really we're fine where we are.

573
01:03:24,560 --> 01:03:26,915
Oh, hell, look,
I know the Lazy ''J.''

574
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:28,991
Whole place is as good
as falling down around your ears.

575
01:03:29,040 --> 01:03:32,157
Frank, they're already
all settled in.

576
01:03:32,240 --> 01:03:34,595
And anyway, I'm sure
they want their privacy.

577
01:03:34,680 --> 01:03:38,912
Well, it's got doors, Diane,
and private as can be.

578
01:03:40,200 --> 01:03:42,634
Tom?

579
01:03:42,680 --> 01:03:45,035
I don't have a problem with it.
I think it's up to Annie.

580
01:03:46,280 --> 01:03:49,078
Well, it'd be great for when my dad
comes to visit.

581
01:03:49,160 --> 01:03:51,674
Where is your dad, honey?

582
01:03:51,760 --> 01:03:54,479
He's at home, working.

583
01:03:54,520 --> 01:03:56,397
You know, um-- I don't know, um--

584
01:03:59,600 --> 01:04:03,912
Is it worth it, really? I mean,
how long do you think you'll carry on
working with Pilgrim?

585
01:04:03,960 --> 01:04:06,235
That depends on Pilgrim.

586
01:04:08,880 --> 01:04:12,236
I know. Me, too.
When are you comin' to visit?

587
01:04:14,800 --> 01:04:18,634
Yeah, well, there'll be plenty of room
'cause we're moving down to the ranch.

588
01:04:18,680 --> 01:04:21,035
Yeah, yeah. They've got this really cute
little house down by the creek.

589
01:04:21,120 --> 01:04:23,190
It's really pretty.

590
01:04:23,280 --> 01:04:27,398
Okay. Okay.
I love you, too.

591
01:04:28,040 --> 01:04:30,110
Ho-Hold on.

592
01:04:30,160 --> 01:04:32,071
Dad wants to talk to you.

593
01:04:33,080 --> 01:04:34,513
Hi.

594
01:04:34,600 --> 01:04:37,194
<i>- Well, she sounds like
she's doing all right. How is she?
- Yeah.</i>

595
01:04:38,960 --> 01:04:42,157
You know, I think she seems
to be getting more comfortable
on the ranch...

596
01:04:42,240 --> 01:04:45,471
which is, which is the only reason
I said yes to this move.

597
01:04:45,520 --> 01:04:48,239
Well, that makes sense.

598
01:04:48,320 --> 01:04:52,199
So, how are you doing out there
in Marlboro country?

599
01:04:52,240 --> 01:04:55,789
<i>- Is the magazine complaining at all?
- Yeah, but nothing I can't handle.</i>

600
01:04:55,880 --> 01:04:58,440
Lucy says she thinks Gottschalk's
plotting. But what else is new, hmm?

601
01:04:58,520 --> 01:05:01,830
So when are you coming home?

602
01:05:01,920 --> 01:05:05,230
You know, I asked him that myself
tonight, and he doesn't know.

603
01:05:05,320 --> 01:05:08,835
Hmm. I miss you, Annie.

604
01:05:09,840 --> 01:05:12,195
Yeah, I know.
We miss you, too.

605
01:05:13,880 --> 01:05:16,713
- Good night.
- 'Night.

606
01:05:22,040 --> 01:05:24,554
Did you ask him to come visit?

607
01:05:26,200 --> 01:05:29,590
You already did.
Do you want me to help you pack?

608
01:06:44,560 --> 01:06:47,313
- Hi.
- Howdy.

609
01:07:05,920 --> 01:07:08,309
What's he doing?

610
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:11,472
He's tryin' go get him
to hook on.

611
01:07:16,880 --> 01:07:18,791
How's it going?

612
01:11:27,320 --> 01:11:29,390
Get over there!

613
01:11:41,480 --> 01:11:43,596
Ha! Come on!

614
01:12:31,920 --> 01:12:34,150
Hey, you over there!

615
01:12:34,240 --> 01:12:36,629
Wanna make yourself useful?

616
01:12:38,040 --> 01:12:40,156
- Hey, Hank.
- Yeah?

617
01:12:40,240 --> 01:12:42,196
I think you got a volunteer here.
You wanna take care of her?

618
01:12:54,040 --> 01:12:57,157
Where's Grace? Grace?

619
01:13:42,200 --> 01:13:44,111
- You okay?
- Yeah.

620
01:13:44,160 --> 01:13:46,037
- Cocktail hour yet?
- What?

621
01:13:46,080 --> 01:13:48,435
I said, is it cocktail hour yet?

622
01:13:53,640 --> 01:13:55,471
Come here a second.

623
01:13:58,080 --> 01:14:02,232
You handled that pretty well.
I think it's time you started earning
your keep around here.

624
01:14:02,320 --> 01:14:04,390
So when we're not working,
you're not doing your therapy...

625
01:14:04,440 --> 01:14:07,671
I'd like you to help out
with the horses, you know,
rubbin' them, cleanin' the stalls.

626
01:14:07,760 --> 01:14:09,671
Think you can handle that?

627
01:14:09,720 --> 01:14:12,837
- That's not a question, is it?
- Nope.

628
01:14:13,920 --> 01:14:15,797
Okay.

629
01:14:22,480 --> 01:14:23,833
Hey, cowboy.

630
01:14:23,920 --> 01:14:27,754
<i>When I was out walkin'
one morning for pleasure</i>

631
01:14:27,800 --> 01:14:31,315
<i>Spied a cowpuncher
come a-lopin'along</i>

632
01:14:31,360 --> 01:14:35,319
<i>His hat was throwed back
and his spurs was a-jinglin'</i>

633
01:14:35,360 --> 01:14:39,353
<i>And as he approached
he was singin'this song</i>

634
01:14:43,160 --> 01:14:45,720
Hey, you little ones.
How are you?

635
01:14:45,760 --> 01:14:48,832
He was only 1 8, he had a flat
on his little pickup, and--

636
01:14:48,920 --> 01:14:50,911
You know you're not allowed
to go swimming in the river.

637
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:53,560
And Marie here made the best pie.
Cherry pie. Go get some.

638
01:14:53,600 --> 01:14:57,309
As luck would have it, he didn't have
all the lug nuts off...

639
01:14:57,400 --> 01:15:00,790
but the jack slipped and fell
right on that rock he calls a head.

640
01:15:03,040 --> 01:15:04,519
Is he okay?

641
01:15:04,600 --> 01:15:07,239
Well, it rearranged his scalp
about 1 2 inches--

642
01:15:07,320 --> 01:15:10,551
But he always dreamed of having a place
where he could raise horses...

643
01:15:10,640 --> 01:15:12,915
and have a whole separate life.

644
01:15:12,960 --> 01:15:15,554
My grandson Joe is named for him.

645
01:15:15,640 --> 01:15:18,438
And somebody told him
about a place called Stockett.

646
01:15:18,520 --> 01:15:20,351
He got on his horse
and he rode over there...

647
01:15:20,440 --> 01:15:23,000
and he got off, and he walked
as far as he could one way.

648
01:15:23,080 --> 01:15:26,117
And then he turned around, and he
walked as far as he could to the other.

649
01:15:26,200 --> 01:15:30,591
And then he decided that
that's where he was going to settle.

650
01:15:30,680 --> 01:15:33,956
And that's where we raised
Frank and Tommy.

651
01:15:36,280 --> 01:15:38,748
- Where do you call home?
- She's from New York, Mom.

652
01:15:40,680 --> 01:15:43,433
Um--

653
01:15:43,480 --> 01:15:47,029
Well, I was born in London,
but I'm from all over really.

654
01:15:47,120 --> 01:15:50,157
My father was a diplomat,
and so we moved constantly.

655
01:15:50,200 --> 01:15:52,475
Oh, my.
That sounds very important.

656
01:15:52,560 --> 01:15:54,471
No.

657
01:15:54,520 --> 01:15:56,909
No, he was, he was a wonderful man.

658
01:15:57,000 --> 01:16:00,072
He died when I was 1 2, but we,
we lived all over the world.

659
01:16:00,120 --> 01:16:04,193
We-- It's, it's not the same as,
as knowing a place like this.

660
01:16:04,280 --> 01:16:09,400
Well, sometimes people carry it
more on the inside...

661
01:16:09,440 --> 01:16:11,431
than the outside.

662
01:16:14,400 --> 01:16:18,109
<i>If it hadn't have been
for them troublesome doggies--</i>

663
01:16:18,200 --> 01:16:21,829
I suppose I could gather up
some of these cups and plates.

664
01:16:21,880 --> 01:16:23,757
- You guys done with these?
- Yeah?

665
01:16:23,800 --> 01:16:25,677
You better give me that recipe.
It was really--

666
01:16:25,720 --> 01:16:28,393
I know, I know.
Be glad to tell her anything.

667
01:16:28,440 --> 01:16:30,351
This family has quite a history.

668
01:16:30,400 --> 01:16:32,868
Yeah, it's a story, all right.

669
01:16:35,640 --> 01:16:39,076
- I love how she calls him Tommy.
- Yeah, always did.

670
01:16:39,160 --> 01:16:41,720
I think she always favoured him.

671
01:16:42,720 --> 01:16:44,631
She loves tellin' this story about...

672
01:16:44,720 --> 01:16:47,917
when he was two years old,
he ran off...

673
01:16:47,960 --> 01:16:50,952
and they found him sleepin'
in the barn...

674
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:55,312
between two giant hooves
of a Percheron stallion.

675
01:16:55,400 --> 01:16:59,075
He said that horse was protectin' him,
and nobody could convince him otherwise.
