00:00:36,336 --> 00:00:40,602
<i>Some people say we live
in a world of irreconcilable differences.</i>

2
00:00:44,144 --> 00:00:48,604
<i>Others say a true peace-
lasting peace-</i>

3
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:51,741
<i>can't be obtained because
we haven't found a way yet...</i>

4
00:00:51,851 --> 00:00:54,445
<i>to change the human heart.</i>

5
00:01:04,097 --> 00:01:08,329
<i>I took a journey once with a warrior
named Mincayani...</i>

6
00:01:08,435 --> 00:01:11,962
<i>down a remote river deep
in the Amazon basin of Ecuador.</i>

7
00:01:14,507 --> 00:01:18,102
<i>The events of thatjourney will
challenge what a lot of people say.</i>

8
00:01:43,403 --> 00:01:47,965
<i>To understand what brought us
to the river on that day...</i>

9
00:01:48,074 --> 00:01:51,635
<i>you need to know about Mincayani
and his people...</i>

10
00:01:51,744 --> 00:01:53,769
<i>the Waodani.</i>

11
00:01:56,382 --> 00:01:59,840
<i>You see, our story was set in motion
before I was even born.</i>

12
00:02:03,723 --> 00:02:06,055
<i>Mincayani was just a boy.</i>

13
00:02:09,729 --> 00:02:14,598
1943
Amazon Basin, Ecuador

14
00:02:16,836 --> 00:02:21,034
<i>Mincayani had grown up
in the rain forest...</i>

15
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:24,907
<i>living the same way the Waodani people
had lived since the beginning of time.</i>

16
00:02:35,054 --> 00:02:38,990
<i>The fierceness of the Waodani
tribe was legendary.</i>

17
00:02:39,092 --> 00:02:43,290
<i>More than half of all the Waodani
died from the spears of other Waodani...</i>

18
00:02:45,365 --> 00:02:47,925
<i>and the cycle
of revenge-spearing...</i>

19
00:02:48,034 --> 00:02:50,867
<i>had brought them to
the brink of extinction.</i>

20
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:45,623
<i>Moipa!</i>

21
00:04:21,427 --> 00:04:24,294
<i>Father!</i>

22
00:04:34,841 --> 00:04:37,002
Get Gimade!

23
00:06:45,571 --> 00:06:50,133
Dayumae!

24
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:52,211
<i>Dayumae.!</i>

25
00:07:06,225 --> 00:07:09,319
You went back
for the stupid bird?

26
00:07:10,563 --> 00:07:13,930
I went back to
put Nemo in the earth...

27
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:18,760
<i>so her spirit won't wander.</i>

28
00:07:20,473 --> 00:07:23,670
Now I follow
my father's carvings.

29
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:39,881
<i>Father.! Father.!</i>

30
00:07:39,992 --> 00:07:42,984
I was so afraid you were dead.

31
00:07:46,165 --> 00:07:48,725
<i>Where is Nemo?</i>

32
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:07,044
Mincayani went back for the bird.

33
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:11,385
Dayumae went back for the stupid bird.
I say we eat him.

34
00:08:18,764 --> 00:08:21,562
There is no food in this place.

35
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:25,000
If you die, I'll strangle her...

36
00:08:25,104 --> 00:08:27,095
and put her
in the earth with you.

37
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:39,143
Do you want me
in the earth with you?

38
00:08:43,956 --> 00:08:46,254
Mincayani, come here.

39
00:08:51,898 --> 00:08:55,163
Take Dayumae into the forest.

40
00:08:56,469 --> 00:08:59,461
Don't let her mother find her.

41
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:04,576
Are you leaving us?

42
00:09:04,677 --> 00:09:08,010
<i>I mustjump the Great Boa.</i>

43
00:09:24,363 --> 00:09:26,797
Next full moon, we'll go back.

44
00:09:29,735 --> 00:09:32,795
I'll never go back.

45
00:09:59,732 --> 00:10:02,166
- No, Dayumae. They'll kill you.
- I'm dead if I stay.

46
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:06,500
- They'll eat your flesh.
- Then I'll join my father.

47
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:12,843
Watch out! Shoot!

48
00:10:12,945 --> 00:10:14,378
<i>Shoot.!</i>

49
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,880
I've only one bullet!

50
00:10:18,551 --> 00:10:20,951
There are others!

51
00:10:29,228 --> 00:10:33,358
1956 Shell Mera, Ecuador

52
00:10:35,768 --> 00:10:37,702
<i>Ever since I was a boy...</i>

53
00:10:37,803 --> 00:10:39,964
<i>I loved making
things with my hands.</i>

54
00:10:42,508 --> 00:10:46,274
<i>Mom and Aunt Rachel said that Dad and I
were very much alike that way.</i>

55
00:10:50,916 --> 00:10:54,181
<i>I was eight years old
when we made a model plane together.</i>

56
00:11:14,273 --> 00:11:18,073
<i>That was the time when Dad
was first looking for the Waodani.</i>

57
00:11:30,856 --> 00:11:34,690
<i>I had heard the violent stories
of the Waodani.</i>

58
00:11:35,795 --> 00:11:38,286
<i>Everyone near thejungle did.</i>

59
00:11:39,498 --> 00:11:42,990
<i>Dad said he saw their violence
as a trap...</i>

60
00:11:43,102 --> 00:11:46,731
<i>like a prison that they couldn't
escape from on their own.</i>

61
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:51,510
<i>He would make flights
as often as he could...</i>

62
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:54,670
<i>try to find one of their
small villages.</i>

63
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:59,046
<i>That was the only time
I was afraid when he was flying.</i>

64
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,587
<i>I'm guessing Mincayani must have been
around 20 years old...</i>

65
00:12:03,689 --> 00:12:06,624
<i>when he first saw my father's plane.</i>

66
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:11,957
<i>It's a guess because the Waodani
don't mark time.</i>

67
00:12:12,064 --> 00:12:14,965
<i>To this day, Mincayani
doesn't know his actual age.</i>

68
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:19,697
Mincayani,
we need wives to make our drink.

69
00:12:21,006 --> 00:12:23,941
We say take them
from the Aenomenani.

70
00:12:24,043 --> 00:12:26,273
What do you say?

71
00:12:30,883 --> 00:12:33,613
I say a jaguar ate this monkey.

72
00:12:33,719 --> 00:12:38,452
<i>Maybe the monkey ate himself.</i>

73
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:48,589
He thinks the Aenomenani
sent a jaguar spirit.

74
00:13:09,555 --> 00:13:11,455
I will spear this jaguar.

75
00:13:16,095 --> 00:13:19,861
We need women, not jaguar.

76
00:13:19,965 --> 00:13:23,230
We should hunt monkeys
or wild pigs.

77
00:13:23,335 --> 00:13:25,269
At least something we can eat.

78
00:13:39,685 --> 00:13:41,653
Shell, 5-6 Henry.

79
00:13:41,754 --> 00:13:43,915
South section clear.

80
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:47,259
Roger that.

81
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:50,485
All right. I'm goin' down
for a closer look.

82
00:14:51,223 --> 00:14:54,750
A very big wood bee.

83
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:03,259
Contact, Sector Six.
Do you copy, Shell?

84
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:06,667
- Roger that.
- Shell.

85
00:15:06,772 --> 00:15:10,299
I said, "Contact!" Whoo!

86
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:14,470
We found 'em!
North corridor, Sector Six.

87
00:15:17,016 --> 00:15:20,349
- Mom!
- Do you copy?

88
00:15:20,452 --> 00:15:23,478
Second river,
south of the Curraray.

89
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:26,649
Mom! Mom!

90
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:29,956
Stevie boy?

91
00:15:30,062 --> 00:15:32,690
Contact. Sector Six.
Do you copy?

92
00:15:32,798 --> 00:15:36,290
Um, c-contact. Sector Six.
Roger that.

93
00:15:40,372 --> 00:15:42,340
I'm goin' around.

94
00:15:52,017 --> 00:15:55,509
I saw one. I know I did.

95
00:16:24,116 --> 00:16:28,712
<i>Mincayani's kissing thejaguar.</i>

96
00:16:33,726 --> 00:16:36,524
<i>The days that followed
were like Christmas.</i>

97
00:16:36,628 --> 00:16:41,224
<i>Our home was kind of a base
for everyone who lived in thejungles.</i>

98
00:16:43,602 --> 00:16:45,729
<i>Dad would fly them in and out
of remote airstrips...</i>

99
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:49,239
<i>bringing them supplies.</i>

100
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:52,572
<i>But those missionaries, the families
that came to our house...</i>

101
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:55,169
<i>to celebrate finding
the Waodani...</i>

102
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:57,248
<i>they were special.</i>

103
00:16:57,349 --> 00:17:01,843
<i>The Elliots, the McCullys,
the Flemings and the Youderians.</i>

104
00:17:01,954 --> 00:17:03,854
<i>They were closer to us
than any blood family.</i>

105
00:17:03,956 --> 00:17:06,550
And the bucket turns
in an even bigger circle.

106
00:17:06,658 --> 00:17:08,717
Of course, if you do it like that.

107
00:17:08,827 --> 00:17:10,852
<i>Dad, of course,
was always forging ahead.</i>

108
00:17:10,963 --> 00:17:13,523
Just-Jim,just watch me.

109
00:17:13,632 --> 00:17:15,896
What we're gonna do...

110
00:17:16,001 --> 00:17:17,901
is we're gonna let out...

111
00:17:18,003 --> 00:17:19,903
so much line
that the drag...

112
00:17:20,005 --> 00:17:23,133
of that line is gonna work
with centrifugal force.

113
00:17:23,242 --> 00:17:27,804
See that? And as I keep the airplane
in that tight, continuous turn-

114
00:17:30,249 --> 00:17:32,809
Oh, wow. Look at that.

115
00:17:32,918 --> 00:17:36,183
Huh? The bucket stays in almost
exactly the same spot.

116
00:17:36,288 --> 00:17:38,256
It hardly moves.

117
00:17:38,357 --> 00:17:42,225
- In theory. In theory.
- In theory.

118
00:17:42,327 --> 00:17:45,558
- Do you know what theory is?
- In theory.

119
00:17:45,664 --> 00:17:47,461
- Do you believe me?
- Mm-hmm.

120
00:17:48,934 --> 00:17:50,925
You know what this means?

121
00:17:52,471 --> 00:17:54,769
This is it. W-W-We...

122
00:17:54,873 --> 00:17:56,898
made contact.

123
00:17:58,544 --> 00:18:01,342
Actually, Nate, I've made
some contact of my own.

124
00:18:04,983 --> 00:18:08,009
I've been learning some Waodani
phrases from Dayumae.

125
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:12,121
Oh, come on, buddy,just relax.
I've been very careful about this.

126
00:18:12,224 --> 00:18:16,490
Rachel knows absolutely nothing about this.
Do you realize what that means?

127
00:18:16,595 --> 00:18:20,258
It means it's time
to rejoin the planet.

128
00:18:20,365 --> 00:18:24,301
It means that I can say...

129
00:18:24,403 --> 00:18:26,837
"Where's the john" in Waodani!

130
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:29,203
UncleJim.

131
00:18:29,308 --> 00:18:32,209
- Oh, UncleJim.
- Wanna try this, son?

132
00:18:32,311 --> 00:18:34,336
<i>- Yeah.
- Shouldn't you tell Rachel?</i>

133
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:40,814
She understands the language
better than any of us.

134
00:18:40,919 --> 00:18:44,150
Betty, I tell my sister...

135
00:18:44,256 --> 00:18:46,383
and she's gonna go tell
her superiors.

136
00:18:46,492 --> 00:18:50,326
Next, we're gonna still be talkin'
about this in two years.

137
00:18:50,429 --> 00:18:53,921
We don't have two years, Betty.

138
00:18:56,668 --> 00:18:59,034
The Waodani are killing...

139
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:01,766
so many people.

140
00:19:01,874 --> 00:19:06,311
The government's under pressure.
They're gonna bring in troops.

141
00:19:06,411 --> 00:19:09,312
We have one chance
to reach these people.

142
00:19:10,382 --> 00:19:13,681
Now. This is it.

143
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:19,881
<i>If Nate's bucket drop
really works-</i>

144
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:22,153
He thinks he can find
a place to put the plane down-

145
00:19:22,261 --> 00:19:26,493
Maybe a sand bar-
Hey! We'll call it "Palm Beach. "

146
00:19:26,598 --> 00:19:28,657
<i>- Jim.
- Oh, come on.!</i>

147
00:19:32,538 --> 00:19:34,563
Me Tarzan!

148
00:19:37,776 --> 00:19:41,234
<i>Jim, this is not a picnic.</i>

149
00:19:41,346 --> 00:19:44,509
<i>No one's ever made contact with
these people and lived to talk about it.</i>

150
00:19:44,616 --> 00:19:46,811
<i>We'll have our guns.
We'll shoot in the air.</i>

151
00:19:46,919 --> 00:19:48,887
<i>The Indians always run
from guns.</i>

152
00:19:50,355 --> 00:19:52,721
<i>They always run, Olive.</i>

153
00:19:52,824 --> 00:19:55,019
<i>What if they don't run?</i>

154
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,664
<i>- It looks like they're home.
- Oh,yeah.!</i>

155
00:20:37,769 --> 00:20:39,600
<i>Are you sure this'll work?</i>

156
00:20:39,705 --> 00:20:41,673
<i>You know what theory is?</i>

157
00:20:41,773 --> 00:20:44,833
I know what "idiot" is.

158
00:20:47,546 --> 00:20:52,006
<i>- Let's go. Bucket time.!
- Copy that.</i>

159
00:20:52,117 --> 00:20:56,247
<i>Whoo!
;Vaya con Dios.!</i>

160
00:20:56,355 --> 00:20:59,791
- Whoo!
- Here we go!

161
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:16,298
<i>Whoa.! Steady there, boy.
You're shakin'my breakfast.</i>

162
00:21:16,408 --> 00:21:19,343
Don't throw up on the Waodani.

163
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:11,986
Dayumae is alive!

164
00:22:12,097 --> 00:22:15,066
Dayumae is alive!

165
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:19,536
- Dayumae is alive.
- They've eaten her!

166
00:22:25,877 --> 00:22:28,539
That was incredible!

167
00:22:28,647 --> 00:22:31,309
The guys are never
gonna believe it.

168
00:22:31,416 --> 00:22:33,782
This is fantastic!

169
00:22:45,497 --> 00:22:50,059
<i>Aunt Rachel lived in a remote
Quechua village that bordered Waodani territory.</i>

170
00:22:51,636 --> 00:22:55,470
<i>She was 12 years older than Dad
and helped raise him.</i>

171
00:22:55,574 --> 00:23:00,409
<i>I knew Dad was protecting her by
keeping the Waodani contact a secret.</i>

172
00:23:00,512 --> 00:23:02,537
<i>I just wanted someone
to protect Dad.</i>

173
00:23:03,648 --> 00:23:06,742
<i>Ila, Ila.
Shell calling Ila. Over.</i>

174
00:23:06,852 --> 00:23:09,878
Ila, this is Shell. Over.

175
00:23:09,988 --> 00:23:13,219
Stevie, what a wonderful surprise.
How are you?

176
00:23:13,325 --> 00:23:16,726
<i>Oh, I'm good, Aunt Rachel.
I'm good.</i>

177
00:23:16,828 --> 00:23:20,389
<i>I'm preparing a little surprise
for Mom, and I need some help.</i>

178
00:23:20,499 --> 00:23:23,468
A surprise? Sounds great.
Fire away.

179
00:23:23,568 --> 00:23:27,971
Mom wanted Dad to speak at least
one line of native dialect properly...

180
00:23:28,073 --> 00:23:31,008
but now he's driving her nuts.

181
00:23:31,109 --> 00:23:34,567
Hey, don't be so hard on him.
His Quechua's not that bad.

182
00:23:34,679 --> 00:23:37,375
No, not Quechua. Waodani.

183
00:23:41,887 --> 00:23:44,583
Waodani? Why?

184
00:23:44,689 --> 00:23:48,352
Well, because he wants to
be able to greet Dayumae...

185
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:51,429
next time she comes.

186
00:23:52,564 --> 00:23:54,555
All right. What do you
have in mind?

187
00:23:54,666 --> 00:23:58,602
<i>Something simple like,
"I'm your friend. "</i>

188
00:23:58,703 --> 00:24:03,037
So, you want
"I'm your friend," in Wao?

189
00:24:03,141 --> 00:24:05,575
"Your sincere friend. "

190
00:24:05,677 --> 00:24:09,477
Well, that's an easy one.
Just repeat this after Dayumae.

191
00:24:09,581 --> 00:24:12,948
- Hi, Dayumae.
- Hello, Stevie.

192
00:24:13,051 --> 00:24:15,952
We say-

193
00:24:46,551 --> 00:24:50,715
We must spear Moipa quickly.

194
00:25:38,336 --> 00:25:41,464
Not the children!

195
00:25:45,810 --> 00:25:49,940
<i>Who has killed Moipa?</i>

196
00:25:53,251 --> 00:25:55,879
Show yourself.
Let me see you.

197
00:26:07,866 --> 00:26:09,891
A boy?

198
00:26:10,001 --> 00:26:14,495
A boy has killed Moipa?

199
00:26:28,019 --> 00:26:30,180
We'll take the women with us.

200
00:26:42,133 --> 00:26:45,330
<i>Moipa doesn't deserve
to go into the earth.!</i>

201
00:26:45,437 --> 00:26:47,496
He's a warrior just like us!

202
00:26:47,606 --> 00:26:50,268
Let the Great Boa judge him,
not Nampa!

203
00:26:54,179 --> 00:26:57,876
This one will make my drink.
What do you say?

204
00:28:19,130 --> 00:28:23,590
<i>No. Don't take it.</i>

205
00:28:23,702 --> 00:28:26,603
No. No, don't take it.

206
00:28:39,284 --> 00:28:41,752
- They give us something?
- Yeah.

207
00:28:41,853 --> 00:28:44,822
You're kidding me.

208
00:28:45,990 --> 00:28:49,153
- Whoa!
- Must be a very special bird.

209
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:52,491
Here we go! Whoo!

210
00:29:03,541 --> 00:29:06,567
What's going on down there?

211
00:29:06,678 --> 00:29:09,841
Whoa! Cut the line,Jim.

212
00:29:12,784 --> 00:29:14,775
Anytime, buddy!

213
00:29:35,874 --> 00:29:38,968
Stevie boy! Lunch!

214
00:29:41,813 --> 00:29:45,214
Honey, your daddy
won't be back for hours.

215
00:29:45,316 --> 00:29:48,285
<i>I'm not hungry.</i>

216
00:30:03,034 --> 00:30:07,334
<i>I knew we had a small runway.</i>

217
00:30:07,438 --> 00:30:10,202
<i>I tried to imagine Dad landing
on the river sandbar...</i>

218
00:30:10,308 --> 00:30:12,868
<i>he'd found
near the Waodani village.</i>

219
00:30:16,815 --> 00:30:18,874
<i>I told him I wished
I could be there with him.</i>

220
00:30:18,983 --> 00:30:23,147
<i>He said, "Don't worry.
You will be. "</i>

221
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:17,938
Come on!

222
00:31:54,679 --> 00:31:56,943
What will I do?

223
00:32:00,585 --> 00:32:03,145
Here we go.
Wanna go with Mama?

224
00:32:03,254 --> 00:32:06,519
Go Mama with the little rocks
in your hand?

225
00:32:09,894 --> 00:32:14,593
Oh! My little girl.
Be good.

226
00:32:18,803 --> 00:32:22,239
Son, you know I can
leave that here.

227
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:24,308
You just say the word.

228
00:32:27,011 --> 00:32:28,979
Good boy.

229
00:32:31,482 --> 00:32:33,780
Let's get it in the airplane.

230
00:32:40,658 --> 00:32:42,558
I guess that's it.

231
00:33:00,845 --> 00:33:04,838
Do you know how far away
the sun is?

232
00:33:04,949 --> 00:33:08,749
93,000,000 miles.

233
00:33:15,159 --> 00:33:20,096
Do you know that
that's a fraction...

234
00:33:20,198 --> 00:33:22,962
of how much
your daddy loves you?

235
00:33:26,537 --> 00:33:29,233
If the Waodani attack...

236
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:31,934
will you defend yourself?

237
00:33:32,043 --> 00:33:34,034
Will you use your guns?

238
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:38,676
Son, we can't shoot the Waodani.

239
00:33:41,319 --> 00:33:43,753
They're not ready for heaven.

240
00:33:45,289 --> 00:33:47,450
We are.

241
00:33:48,659 --> 00:33:52,254
<i>Promise me one thing,
just one-</i>

242
00:33:52,363 --> 00:33:57,300
<i>"One thing. "
You sound like your mother.</i>

243
00:33:59,904 --> 00:34:03,431
If you get in a jam,
a real jam...

244
00:34:03,541 --> 00:34:05,566
promise me you'll say
these words to them.

245
00:34:05,676 --> 00:34:07,610
What words?

246
00:34:07,712 --> 00:34:09,737
The Waodani words.

247
00:34:09,847 --> 00:34:12,077
They mean
"I am your friend.

248
00:34:12,183 --> 00:34:14,777
Your sincere friend. "

249
00:34:36,774 --> 00:34:40,437
- Right?
- Yeah.

250
00:34:40,545 --> 00:34:43,070
Okay. Come here.

251
00:34:49,654 --> 00:34:51,622
Have everything then?

252
00:34:53,558 --> 00:34:56,618
Let's see.
One, two, three, four.

253
00:34:56,727 --> 00:34:58,820
- Good.
- Bye.

254
00:35:07,972 --> 00:35:10,964
Watch.

255
00:35:17,081 --> 00:35:18,981
- Come back to me.
- Hey.

256
00:35:20,318 --> 00:35:22,309
All right?

257
00:35:28,693 --> 00:35:30,923
See you on the radio.

258
00:35:34,499 --> 00:35:36,524
<i>Stevie, be a good boy.</i>

259
00:36:10,501 --> 00:36:12,628
I love you, Dad.

260
00:36:17,875 --> 00:36:20,002
I love you.

261
00:36:37,395 --> 00:36:39,727
<i>Don't be afraid of us.!</i>

262
00:36:40,965 --> 00:36:42,956
<i>The creator God
you call Waengongi-</i>

263
00:36:43,067 --> 00:36:44,864
Waengongi has sent us.

264
00:36:44,969 --> 00:36:47,563
<i>We'rejust like you.</i>

265
00:36:59,717 --> 00:37:02,413
Roger, what do ya think?

266
00:37:04,155 --> 00:37:08,319
All this preaching to the jungle, how long
before the monkeys get saved?

267
00:37:08,426 --> 00:37:11,657
Yeah, well, at least if they do,
we'll know someone's listening.

268
00:37:20,271 --> 00:37:22,831
The creator God is our friend.

269
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:25,340
<i>What's he talking about?</i>

270
00:37:27,912 --> 00:37:30,472
<i>How does that one sound like a woman?</i>

271
00:37:31,782 --> 00:37:34,615
<i>Even when drinking?</i>

272
00:37:36,387 --> 00:37:38,287
I'll go to them...

273
00:37:39,824 --> 00:37:41,951
and see if Dayumae lives.

274
00:37:42,059 --> 00:37:44,186
The foreigners are cannibals.

275
00:37:44,295 --> 00:37:46,855
I'll go with my sister.

276
00:37:46,964 --> 00:37:49,489
No, I'll go.

277
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:51,465
<i>Go home to your second wife...</i>

278
00:37:51,569 --> 00:37:54,663
and stay away from my sister!

279
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:58,465
<i>Enough.!</i>

280
00:37:58,576 --> 00:38:00,510
Let's go hunting.

281
00:38:17,194 --> 00:38:21,153
Gentlemen!
We got company.

282
00:38:25,569 --> 00:38:27,696
We're just like you.

283
00:38:35,246 --> 00:38:37,510
We're just like you.

284
00:38:54,198 --> 00:38:59,226
Ed. My name is Ed. What is your name?

285
00:38:59,337 --> 00:39:01,805
Dayumae is my sister.

286
00:39:01,906 --> 00:39:05,501
Can you show me
where she is?

287
00:39:05,609 --> 00:39:09,238
<i>Can you take me
in the wood bee?</i>

288
00:39:09,347 --> 00:39:11,941
Maybe her name is
really, really long.

289
00:39:12,049 --> 00:39:15,951
<i>I'll be very happy
if you take me.</i>

290
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:51,711
Take me to Dayumae.

291
00:39:53,657 --> 00:39:56,251
Take me to Dayumae.

292
00:39:56,360 --> 00:40:00,228
<i>All right. I- I don't-</i>

293
00:40:02,233 --> 00:40:04,565
- I don't know-
- He wants something.

294
00:40:04,668 --> 00:40:07,159
<i>Nate.! Nate, the gun.!</i>

295
00:40:10,741 --> 00:40:13,232
Take me to Dayumae.

296
00:40:13,344 --> 00:40:15,505
All right. Airplane. Airplane.

297
00:40:21,552 --> 00:40:25,488
Yeah. I-
That's what you want?

298
00:40:25,589 --> 00:40:27,887
I guess we're gonna go
for a ride.

299
00:40:47,445 --> 00:40:51,211
Mincayani why are you so small,
and I am so fast?

300
00:40:58,489 --> 00:41:00,821
Oh, no, no!

301
00:41:37,928 --> 00:41:40,226
Yeah!

302
00:41:42,566 --> 00:41:45,091
The wood bee flies fast.

303
00:41:45,202 --> 00:41:48,899
He tried to get out of the airplane
right above the village.

304
00:41:49,006 --> 00:41:51,031
Did you see Dayumae?

305
00:41:51,141 --> 00:41:53,939
No, I saw Mincayani and Kimo
like ants.

306
00:41:54,044 --> 00:41:58,037
They saw him.
They know we're friendly.

307
00:42:00,951 --> 00:42:03,715
Why don't you
take me to Dayumae?

308
00:42:04,822 --> 00:42:08,280
- Uh-
- We don't understand you.

309
00:42:08,392 --> 00:42:12,488
Go up? Up?

310
00:42:12,596 --> 00:42:15,622
Pete, come here.
I don't know-

311
00:42:15,733 --> 00:42:18,759
<i>I'll check my notes.
They speak so fast.</i>

312
00:42:20,004 --> 00:42:22,131
These foreigners
understand nothing.

313
00:42:25,309 --> 00:42:27,470
Gimade, where are you going?

314
00:42:27,578 --> 00:42:30,012
I guess it's suppertime.

315
00:42:30,114 --> 00:42:35,677
I think you're
a very tall woman.

316
00:42:35,786 --> 00:42:38,812
You sing like
a beautiful canary.

317
00:42:40,357 --> 00:42:43,053
She just proposed to you, Roger.

318
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:05,515
Why's he alone with my sister?

319
00:43:05,616 --> 00:43:07,516
Where's Maengamo?

320
00:43:10,087 --> 00:43:12,351
<i>Where is she?</i>

321
00:43:12,456 --> 00:43:17,155
The foreigners attacked us.
We ran!

322
00:43:17,261 --> 00:43:20,025
But we saw you
in the wood bee!

323
00:43:21,565 --> 00:43:23,692
<i>I wanted to see Dayumae...</i>

324
00:43:23,801 --> 00:43:25,530
but they already killed her.

325
00:43:28,172 --> 00:43:30,140
Gimade, is this true?

326
00:43:34,278 --> 00:43:38,476
We didn't see her.
She must be dead.

327
00:43:41,218 --> 00:43:43,880
<i>Don't the foreigners
always kill us?</i>

328
00:43:43,988 --> 00:43:49,290
<i>- Why should we spear each other?
- I say we spear them now.</i>

329
00:43:49,393 --> 00:43:51,054
Mincayani, what do you say?

330
00:44:01,939 --> 00:44:05,102
Nenkiwi says they've killed Dayumae!

331
00:44:06,810 --> 00:44:09,176
What else does Nenkiwi say?

332
00:44:09,279 --> 00:44:13,181
- I say they ate her flesh.
- They can't eat if they're dead.

333
00:44:13,283 --> 00:44:17,743
Nenkiwi's right.
We must spear them!

334
00:44:30,367 --> 00:44:32,267
Here. Don't drink it all.

335
00:44:32,369 --> 00:44:34,894
What are you trying to say, Petey?

336
00:44:41,011 --> 00:44:43,036
Missionaries.

337
00:44:44,682 --> 00:44:47,549
What? Oh.

338
00:45:43,207 --> 00:45:46,005
<i>Come in, Shell.! Come in.!</i>

339
00:45:50,948 --> 00:45:53,974
Shell, come in.
Come in, Shell.

340
00:47:53,737 --> 00:47:56,797
<i>56 Henry. This is Shell.</i>

341
00:47:56,907 --> 00:47:59,273
<i>56 Henry.</i>

342
00:47:59,376 --> 00:48:01,606
<i>This is Shell.</i>

343
00:48:01,712 --> 00:48:05,580
<i>Dad, this is Steve.</i>

344
00:48:08,585 --> 00:48:11,554
<i>Are you okay?</i>

345
00:48:11,655 --> 00:48:14,317
<i>Missed your call time.</i>

346
00:48:18,562 --> 00:48:22,430
<i>Tell the owner of the parrot
I'm taking good care of it.</i>

347
00:48:22,532 --> 00:48:24,625
<i>And I know it's a loan, okay?</i>

348
00:48:32,175 --> 00:48:37,112
<i>Okay. Mom wants to talk now.
Please pick up.</i>

349
00:48:37,214 --> 00:48:39,409
<i>Please, Dad.</i>

350
00:50:01,865 --> 00:50:04,163
All the foreigners are coming.

351
00:50:04,267 --> 00:50:07,759
- They search for us?
- No. They searched for the others.

352
00:50:07,871 --> 00:50:09,896
They'll never find them.

353
00:50:10,007 --> 00:50:12,532
The river has hid them.

354
00:51:28,885 --> 00:51:33,822
We've angered all the spirits.

355
00:52:33,383 --> 00:52:36,875
<i>Rachel, it was so hard
for Nate not to tell you.</i>
