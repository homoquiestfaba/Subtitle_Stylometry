lives in the forest.

AUDIENCE MEMBER: Good punchline.

253
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:29,640
- Now, every nymph
lives in a tree.

254
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:32,350
And every tree has a
spirit called a wisher.

255
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:38,390
Because it grants
the nymph wishes.

256
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:41,050
Now the woodsmen figured if
he chopped down the tree,

257
00:17:41,050 --> 00:17:43,480
he'd become the
wisher's new master

258
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:46,360
and he could have all
the wishes he desired.

259

And that's what he did.

260
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:52,940

- Well instead of giving
the Woodsmen what he wished

265
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:08,090
for, the Wisher started
twisting the wishes around.

thing the Woodsman

268

wished for was to have the
largest house in the town.

00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:16,290
Instead of giving him a
big mansion or something,

270
00:18:16,290 --> 00:18:20,130
the Wisher we went out and
burned all the other houses.

271
00:18:20,130 --> 00:18:22,870

at all, his was the largest.

273
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:27,800

figured out what was going on,

274

he nearly had but one choice.

275
00:18:30,170 --> 00:18:32,490

Wisher turned on him.

00:58:49,230 --> 00:58:49,900
- Just get in!

916
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:53,560
Lock your doors.

917
00:58:53,560 --> 00:58:54,230
- Why?

918
00:58:54,230 --> 00:58:55,000
- Just do it!

919
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:56,230
- Where are we going?

920
00:58:56,230 --> 00:58:56,900
- Drive!

921
00:59:00,710 --> 00:59:01,660
DEBBIE: So what is it?

922
00:59:01,660 --> 00:59:03,090
What are you freaking out about?

923
00:59:06,900 --> 00:59:07,660
- It's Brad.

924
00:59:07,660 --> 00:59:08,330
- What?

925
00:59:08,330 --> 00:59:10,210
- He's the one that's
been following me around.

926
00:59:10,210 --> 00:59:11,570
It all makes sense.

927
00:59:15,170 --> 00:59:16,550
- Mary, you're just
being paranoid.

928
00:59:16,550 --> 00:59:18,480
He just has a crush on you.

929
00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:19,750
- A crush or an obsession?

930
00:59:19,750 --> 00:59:21,370
- Look, Mary I've
got to get home.

931
00:59:21,370 --> 00:59:23,520
You made this sound like
it was an emergency.

932
00:59:23,520 --> 00:59:24,890
- It is!

933
00:59:24,890 --> 00:59:26,380
Listen, right
before my dad died,

934
00:59:26,380 --> 00:59:27,780
I walked out of the
house pissed at him.

935
00:59:27,780 --> 00:59:29,710
And I said, I wish he'd go away.

936
00:59:29,710 --> 00:59:31,020
I wish he'd just go away.

937
00:59:31,020 --> 00:59:33,350
Go away, go away.

938
00:59:33,350 --> 00:59:37,420
He was the last one with
Mandy before she was attacked.

939
00:59:37,420 --> 00:59:39,240
- OK.

940
00:59:39,240 --> 00:59:41,230
- And the other night I was
having dinner with my Mom

941
00:59:41,230 --> 00:59:42,970
and I said, I wish I didn't
have to go to school.

942
00:59:42,970 --> 00:59:44,790
MARY (VOICE OVER): I didn't
have to go to school tomorrow

943
00:59:44,790 --> 00:59:46,470
but wishing for something
doesn't make it come true,

944
00:59:46,470 --> 00:59:47,140
come true.

945
00:59:51,480 --> 00:59:54,060
- Then the next day, the
library got torched.

946
00:59:54,060 --> 00:59:58,150
Brad set the fire so I
wouldn't have to go to school.

947
00:59:58,150 --> 01:00:00,910
- Mary, you don't
really believe this.

948
01:00:00,910 --> 01:00:03,390
- You were there when I told
Kara I wish she'd shut up.

949
01:00:03,390 --> 01:00:04,340
I wish you'd just shut up!

950
01:00:04,340 --> 01:00:06,700
- It has nothing to do
with that stupid movie.

951
01:00:06,700 --> 01:00:07,610
- Look what happened.

952
01:00:10,310 --> 01:00:11,660
OK.

953
01:00:11,660 --> 01:00:13,030
I'm with Mandy.

954
01:00:13,030 --> 01:00:15,280
I said I wish he could
see how ugly she is.

955
01:00:15,280 --> 01:00:16,360
MARY (VOICE OVER):
I wish he could

956
01:00:16,360 --> 01:00:17,680
see how ugly she really is.

957
01:00:17,680 --> 01:00:20,910
- Then her face got slashed.

958
01:00:20,910 --> 01:00:23,480
Brad was the last one
to see her, I know.

959
01:00:23,480 --> 01:00:26,570
I was with him.

960
01:00:26,570 --> 01:00:27,940
And he just followed me home.

961
01:00:27,940 --> 01:00:30,230
I was with Beth and
I got mad at her

962
01:00:30,230 --> 01:00:32,440
and I was about to wish for her
to get lost like I always do.

963
01:00:32,440 --> 01:00:35,360
And just as I was saying I
wish you'd get lost I looked up

964
01:00:35,360 --> 01:00:38,090
and I saw him outside
the window staring at me.

965
01:00:38,090 --> 01:00:39,900
It was definitely him.

966
01:00:39,900 --> 01:00:42,000
Like, he was waiting
for what I was gonna say

967
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:43,560
and he was ready to do it.

968
01:00:43,560 --> 01:00:44,860
- Mary, this is ridiculous.

969
01:00:44,860 --> 01:00:47,050
Why would Brad be running
around granting you wishes?

970
01:01:06,360 --> 01:01:09,150
DEBBIE: I want to try something.

971
01:01:09,150 --> 01:01:10,790
MARY: Try what?

972
01:01:10,790 --> 01:01:12,520
DEBBIE: Just have an
open mind about this, OK?

973
01:01:21,650 --> 01:01:23,100
- Debbie, tell me
what we're doing.

974
01:01:23,100 --> 01:01:25,940
DEBBIE: Just come on,
it'll take a second.

975
01:01:25,940 --> 01:01:27,370
- What are we doing here?

976
01:01:27,370 --> 01:01:28,040
- OK.

977
01:01:28,040 --> 01:01:29,640
Wish for a winning ticket.

978
01:01:29,640 --> 01:01:30,550
- Ugh, God, Debbie.

979
01:01:30,550 --> 01:01:31,250
Would you stop it?

980
01:01:31,250 --> 01:01:31,920
- Come on.

981
01:01:31,920 --> 01:01:32,900
Don't rule anything out.

982
01:01:32,900 --> 01:01:36,220
Just wish for a winner and
let's see what happens.

983
01:01:36,220 --> 01:01:37,190
- It's not going to work.

984
01:01:37,190 --> 01:01:38,890
- Just give it a try.

985
01:01:38,890 --> 01:01:41,560
Here, pick one of these.

986
01:01:41,560 --> 01:01:42,240
- OK, um, fine.

987
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:44,400
How about movie magic?

988
01:01:47,720 --> 01:01:48,390
OK.

989
01:01:48,390 --> 01:01:50,090
- Make a wish and scratch it off.

990
01:02:00,890 --> 01:02:03,070
- Loser.

991
01:02:03,070 --> 01:02:05,560
- Well, maybe it wasn't
a winner because you

992
01:02:05,560 --> 01:02:06,490
didn't say it out loud.

993
01:02:09,010 --> 01:02:09,680
- OK.

994
01:02:09,680 --> 01:02:10,380
Fine.

995
01:02:10,380 --> 01:02:11,050
Watch this.

996
01:02:11,050 --> 01:02:11,970
- Watch what?

997
01:02:15,160 --> 01:02:17,730
- I wish I had a blue gumball.

998
01:02:28,290 --> 01:02:31,370
So much for my special powers.

999
01:02:31,370 --> 01:02:34,020
Come on.

1000
01:02:34,020 --> 01:02:37,760
- Maybe your wishes don't
work for good things, only

1001
01:02:37,760 --> 01:02:38,480
bad things.

1002
01:02:43,590 --> 01:02:45,100
Wish that I crash the car.

1003
01:02:45,100 --> 01:02:46,290
- What?

1004
01:02:46,290 --> 01:02:47,860
- Let's see what happens.

1005
01:02:47,860 --> 01:02:49,220
- No.

1006
01:02:49,220 --> 01:02:49,990
- Come on.

1007
01:02:49,990 --> 01:02:51,620
Try it.

1008
01:02:51,620 --> 01:02:52,990
- You're making fun of me.

1009
01:02:52,990 --> 01:02:54,360
- No, I swear, I'm not.

1010
01:02:54,360 --> 01:02:55,640
Just wish that I crash the car.

1011
01:02:55,640 --> 01:02:57,670
- This is so stupid.

1012
01:02:57,670 --> 01:02:59,320
- More stupid than
somebody running around

1013
01:02:59,320 --> 01:03:02,340
dressed as the killer
in some cheesy B movie?

1014
01:03:02,340 --> 01:03:05,070
Look, there's no way Brad or
whoever could know what you

1015
01:03:05,070 --> 01:03:06,960
were wishing for
all those times.

1016
01:03:06,960 --> 01:03:09,180
I mean, you were alone, right?

1017
01:03:22,800 --> 01:03:24,870
Did it ever occur to you that
this is all in your head?

1018
01:03:29,620 --> 01:03:32,000
- OK.

1019
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:33,900
Fine, if it'll make you happy.

1020
01:03:36,770 --> 01:03:38,290
I wish you'd crash the car!

1021
01:03:44,020 --> 01:03:45,450
DEBBIE: You don't
have to total it,

1022
01:03:45,450 --> 01:03:46,390
just a little fender bender.

1023
01:03:46,390 --> 01:03:48,300
Maybe I could get some
insurance money and fix it up.

1024
01:03:59,280 --> 01:04:00,610
Why do you think
I'm doing all this?

1025
01:04:00,610 --> 01:04:03,440
I'm just trying to prove to you
that this is all in your head.

1026
01:04:03,440 --> 01:04:05,980
That's all.

1027
01:04:05,980 --> 01:04:07,410
- OK.

1028
01:04:07,410 --> 01:04:08,650
Fine.

1029
01:04:08,650 --> 01:04:09,320
Go!

1030
01:04:29,290 --> 01:04:30,240
Slow down!

1031
01:04:30,240 --> 01:04:33,100
- We have to go this fast if
we're going to crash the car!

1032
01:04:33,100 --> 01:04:34,910
- Yeah but you're going
to get us killed!

1033
01:04:34,910 --> 01:04:35,850
- Shut up!

1034
01:04:51,840 --> 01:04:52,790
- You saw it, right?

1035
01:04:52,790 --> 01:04:54,030
Say you're sorry.

1036
01:04:54,030 --> 01:04:54,700
- I'm sorry!

1037
01:04:58,030 --> 01:04:59,260
Where did he go?

1038
01:04:59,260 --> 01:04:59,930
- Start the car.

1039
01:05:18,950 --> 01:05:20,860
DEBBIE: How did he
know where we were?

1040
01:05:20,860 --> 01:05:23,050
MARY: He's been following
us the whole time.

1041
01:05:23,050 --> 01:05:23,710
DEBBIE: Great.

1042
01:05:23,710 --> 01:05:24,670
That's just great.

1043
01:05:32,760 --> 01:05:33,700
I don't believe it.

1044
01:05:33,700 --> 01:05:34,930
Mary, look behind us.

1045
01:05:34,930 --> 01:05:35,600
The cops.

1046
01:05:48,060 --> 01:05:49,300
POLICE OFFICER: So ladies.

1047
01:05:49,300 --> 01:05:50,500
What's the hurry?

1048
01:05:50,500 --> 01:05:52,650
DEBBIE: We just hit
someone back there.

1049
01:05:52,650 --> 01:05:56,880
- That's uh, that's
quite a story.

1050
01:05:56,880 --> 01:05:59,130
- It's not a story.

1051
01:05:59,130 --> 01:06:00,600
DEBBIE: Take a look
at the windshield.

1052
01:06:00,600 --> 01:06:03,260
- Look, somebody is following us.

1053
01:06:03,260 --> 01:06:06,090
- Mary, how many times
have we picked you

1054
01:06:06,090 --> 01:06:08,880
up sleepwalking or
stumbling around?

1055
01:06:08,880 --> 01:06:10,940
You know, there's a lot of kooky
things that go on with you,

1056
01:06:10,940 --> 01:06:11,620
isn't there?

1057
01:06:18,140 --> 01:06:21,030
We're all really sorry about
what happened to your Dad.

1058
01:06:21,030 --> 01:06:22,920
Really.

1059
01:06:22,920 --> 01:06:26,230
But I can't help with that.

1060
01:06:26,230 --> 01:06:27,180
Have a good night.

1061
01:06:39,950 --> 01:06:42,310
(Sighs)

1062
01:06:42,310 --> 01:06:44,690
- Fuck.

1063
01:06:44,690 --> 01:06:45,830
- So much for the cops.

1064
01:06:49,180 --> 01:06:50,570
What are we going to do now?

1065
01:06:55,350 --> 01:06:57,630
- OK.

1066
01:06:57,630 --> 01:06:59,350
If Brad thinks he's
The Wisher then maybe

1067
01:06:59,350 --> 01:07:01,240
there's another way to stop him.

1068
01:07:01,240 --> 01:07:01,910
- How?

1069
01:07:09,970 --> 01:07:10,650
- Debbie.

1070
01:07:10,650 --> 01:07:12,510
- Yeah?

1071
01:07:12,510 --> 01:07:14,760
- Neither of us saw the
end of the movie, right?

1072
01:07:14,760 --> 01:07:15,430
- Right.

1073
01:07:18,630 --> 01:07:19,540
- I've got an idea.

1074
01:07:26,600 --> 01:07:27,540
- What are we doing?

1075
01:07:27,540 --> 01:07:28,480
- Just come on.

1076
01:07:35,820 --> 01:07:36,490
Sam!

1077
01:07:39,780 --> 01:07:41,670
You know the movie The Wisher?

1078
01:07:41,670 --> 01:07:44,040
- Of course.

1079
01:07:44,040 --> 01:07:46,320
- Do you know how to download it?

1080
01:07:46,320 --> 01:07:47,130
- Yeah.

1081
01:07:47,130 --> 01:07:47,800
- Can you show us?

1082
01:07:50,490 --> 01:07:52,320
FEMALE CUSTOMER:
What's going on?

1083
01:07:52,320 --> 01:07:52,990
Power outage?

1084
01:07:52,990 --> 01:07:53,660
What happened?

1085
01:07:57,280 --> 01:07:58,010
- Can you write it down?

1086
01:08:01,600 --> 01:08:03,850
- There you are.

1087
01:08:03,850 --> 01:08:05,730
I've been looking
all over for you.

1088
01:08:05,730 --> 01:08:08,260
Why do you keep avoiding me?

1089
01:08:08,260 --> 01:08:11,120
- I'm not avoiding you.

1090
01:08:11,120 --> 01:08:12,250
- Mary, you know I like you.

1091
01:08:12,250 --> 01:08:13,000
All right.

1092
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:16,800
