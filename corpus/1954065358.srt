00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:46,876
H and L A C O and D

3
00:01:33,961 --> 00:01:35,965
What happened was?

4
00:01:42,016 --> 00:01:45,021
I do not know what happened,
just went out.

5
00:01:45,056 --> 00:01:47,992
I told you that the equipment is not worth it.

6
00:01:48,027 --> 00:01:52,034
Tell the owner,
that nothing happens to this trash.

7
00:01:53,036 --> 00:01:56,041
Yesterday control panel worked normally.
- It means nothing. I tell you,

8
00:01:57,003 --> 00:01:59,047
here is full of crap!

9
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:07,021
Damn it.

10
00:02:10,067 --> 00:02:15,036
Did you? Hey so I speak!
These panels themselves are programmed.

11
00:02:19,083 --> 00:02:22,014
What is it?
- Should be completed today.

12
00:02:22,049 --> 00:02:27,098
Come on! So I now begin.
- After half an hour I group.

13
00:02:38,078 --> 00:02:41,123
And just tell me to collect
things, eh? How so?

14
00:02:41,158 --> 00:02:45,090
People checker.
- My pocket is not shallow?

15
00:02:45,125 --> 00:02:48,136
You know what I mean.

16
00:02:49,098 --> 00:02:51,141
Di, wait!

17
00:02:54,147 --> 00:02:57,152
I told you I do not want drug addicts
about your equipment.

18
00:02:57,187 --> 00:03:00,155
When the bass is clean, is the best.
You know it.

19
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:03,159
Bass was the best years ago
be destroyed.

20
00:03:03,194 --> 00:03:06,129
I control it.
- Be sure of one thing -

21
00:03:06,164 --> 00:03:09,099
Try not to fuck my studio.

22
00:03:09,134 --> 00:03:12,180
And for you I will take care of.
Do not be angry with me.

23
00:03:12,215 --> 00:03:14,183
Do not you mad.

24
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:19,157
We leave.

25
00:03:19,192 --> 00:03:22,198
What would you change the console?
- No, I'm leaving.

26
00:03:22,233 --> 00:03:25,203
Just when you naglasih song, Dee.

27
00:03:25,238 --> 00:03:27,167
I told you to go.

28
00:03:43,236 --> 00:03:45,205
Dee, what are you doing?

29
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:49,247
You said here all night?
- Kicked out of us.

30
00:03:49,282 --> 00:03:53,254
Kicked you?
How you think about that brothers?

31
00:03:54,216 --> 00:03:57,221
This is not a free dinner?

32
00:03:58,223 --> 00:04:02,230
I promised these bitches
to hear how they sing.

33
00:04:03,272 --> 00:04:05,201
Tonight will not happen.

34
00:04:05,236 --> 00:04:11,247
Gage, the whole evening you will kisnem here?
- Shut up, bitch, and march in the car.

35
00:04:11,282 --> 00:04:14,770
Bitch you?
- Do not think you play?

36
00:04:14,805 --> 00:04:18,035
Easy, man.
- That is not right.

37
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:21,265
And above that we will not be played.

38
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:23,274
I'll go to find out!

39
00:04:23,309 --> 00:04:26,239
What are you doing, man?
I told you to calm down.

40
00:04:26,274 --> 00:04:31,323
With Mr. Marshall well understood.
I do not fucking work.

41
00:04:33,287 --> 00:04:37,334
Why do you think will kill him?

42
00:04:37,369 --> 00:04:40,340
That you crazy bastard.

43
00:04:41,341 --> 00:04:43,270
And you are my song, Dee.

44
00:04:43,305 --> 00:04:46,310
Come then to see the bar.

45
00:05:21,374 --> 00:05:24,379
Dee who is this nigga?

46
00:05:26,423 --> 00:05:29,394
Seamus you?
- You know him?

47
00:05:29,429 --> 00:05:34,398
Record producer.
- No, I've seen this somewhere.

48
00:05:34,433 --> 00:05:41,410
In fact ... May beat
Negroes with dealers.

49
00:05:42,452 --> 00:05:46,460
I tell you, that is legitimate
- Give it oberem now.

50
00:05:46,495 --> 00:05:50,467
Only the jewelry will pay
for the studio.

51
00:05:51,429 --> 00:05:54,399
Let's talk about something serious.

52
00:05:54,434 --> 00:05:59,443
Bro, did you not rude
Do not wait for fair play.

53
00:06:01,447 --> 00:06:05,454
You see, I'm right?
Seamus know Johnny White.

54
00:06:06,496 --> 00:06:10,503
So what? He who does?
- Has "Raf on Records."

55
00:06:12,467 --> 00:06:15,437
Does that little guy?

56
00:06:15,472 --> 00:06:18,478
Look, bro. Watch how it's done.

57
00:06:42,561 --> 00:06:47,530
Mr. White is Diamond.
The friend I was talking about.

58
00:06:47,565 --> 00:06:50,501
Nice, Diamond.
- And to me, Mr. White.

59
00:06:50,536 --> 00:06:54,543
Well, Diamond, your manager tells me
that music is it to you.

60
00:06:54,578 --> 00:06:57,566
Would you like to iztananikam something?

61
00:06:57,601 --> 00:07:00,519
You do not need, just give me demokaseta.

62
00:07:00,554 --> 00:07:03,559
If you are as good
may turn business.

63
00:07:04,561 --> 00:07:10,572
Honestly, Mr. White, I tell you.
Cartridge is nearly ready. Super E.

64
00:07:10,607 --> 00:07:11,574
Sure am.

65
00:07:12,616 --> 00:07:15,621
So you and your artist
Work on it

66
00:07:15,656 --> 00:07:18,552
and if I ever finish the
call.

67
00:07:18,587 --> 00:07:22,634
To call you?
Only so, can you call?

68
00:07:27,603 --> 00:07:30,628
Not so much hair.
Forget about it.

69
00:07:30,663 --> 00:07:33,654
Hell Joker!
- At least it was a good experience.

70
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:40,667
All right.

71
00:07:41,629 --> 00:07:43,672
They call us. Let's go.

72
00:08:10,721 --> 00:08:11,688
What took you so long?

73
00:08:11,723 --> 00:08:15,690
Would, as ever fuck with me?
You came?

74
00:08:16,692 --> 00:08:20,699
Diamond, no they will not lately.

75
00:08:20,734 --> 00:08:23,670
Working on his music.

76
00:08:23,705 --> 00:08:26,710
I signed
with a recording studio?

77
00:08:26,745 --> 00:08:28,754
Not yet.

78
00:08:32,761 --> 00:08:36,729
Gage delivers goods,
Tell those pedals

79
00:08:36,764 --> 00:08:39,774
that if I jump with Teddy
pretrepya them.

80
00:08:39,809 --> 00:08:42,779
Well, It. I will warn them.

81
00:08:46,747 --> 00:08:48,790
Come on, Dee.

82
00:09:52,867 --> 00:09:55,837
It is a pleasure to see you again.

83
00:09:55,872 --> 00:09:58,918
Yes, yes. Give brief.
Where is the money?

84
00:09:58,953 --> 00:10:01,888
Why treat me like a stranger?

85
00:10:01,923 --> 00:10:04,929
To say that would not be happy
how do you fuck with Teddy?

86
00:10:05,930 --> 00:10:07,934
No longer do business with Teddy.

87
00:10:08,936 --> 00:10:12,903
Mr. It will be particularly happy
to understand.

88
00:10:12,938 --> 00:10:15,949
All right.

89
00:10:25,967 --> 00:10:28,972
Now it's your turn.

90
00:10:29,974 --> 00:10:32,979
Everything is here.
- Leave it on the table.

91
00:11:27,078 --> 00:11:29,081
Let's get out of here!

92
00:11:29,116 --> 00:11:31,085
Damn! Quick!

93
00:12:09,154 --> 00:12:12,139
I can not believe it.
That small filthy cockroach!

94
00:12:12,174 --> 00:12:15,090
And you try to shake.
- If it was Di,

95
00:12:15,125 --> 00:12:20,174
Now we would be the next world.
- You must feel it.

96
00:12:21,136 --> 00:12:24,161
As Gay said, lucky us.
- Nonsense!

97
00:12:24,196 --> 00:12:27,187
In such a crap
luck is not enough.

98
00:12:28,148 --> 00:12:32,156
I am pleased Gage.
- Yes. You're the best, It.

99
00:12:32,191 --> 00:12:36,203
Enough for me today.
Will hear.

100
00:12:39,168 --> 00:12:41,192
Diamond?

101
00:12:41,227 --> 00:12:43,216
Come.

102
00:12:45,179 --> 00:12:48,185
Did you not to his shadow?

103
00:12:49,187 --> 00:12:51,230
I want to talk to Diamond.

104
00:12:51,265 --> 00:12:54,236
Good. I go out.

105
00:13:03,212 --> 00:13:05,256
Sit down.

106
00:13:06,218 --> 00:13:11,267
Diamond is not my job
to tell you how to live,

107
00:13:11,302 --> 00:13:15,274
but maybe more, much more.

108
00:13:18,279 --> 00:13:21,285
Twice smarter from Gage.
And you know, I know it.

109
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:23,213
So do not talk nonsense.

110
00:13:23,248 --> 00:13:28,298
I know you want to be rap star
like any other kid in the neighborhood.

111
00:13:29,299 --> 00:13:33,267
I'll be honest with you.
Like Gage, hardworking E.

112
00:13:34,268 --> 00:13:38,295
But I need someone with brains.
Someone like you.

113
00:13:38,330 --> 00:13:42,323
It would, I know Gage is a bit dull
but he is my friend.

114
00:13:43,285 --> 00:13:49,336
Together I am 6 years old.
I am his faithful as he is correct.

115
00:13:49,371 --> 00:13:52,341
Would you make me become a traitor?

116
00:13:53,343 --> 00:13:55,347
Not known.

117
00:14:04,323 --> 00:14:08,330
If you hold on to Mr. B,
will earn money for a whole album.

118
00:14:09,372 --> 00:14:14,341
If you hold on to Mr. B,
or die ... or we will conclude.

119
00:14:14,376 --> 00:14:21,354
The day will come
It will withstand when the wall

120
00:14:22,356 --> 00:14:26,403
and he betrayed us,
without even thinking.

121
00:14:27,405 --> 00:14:32,374
If our music as it should be,
will ever get out of the mire.

122
00:14:34,418 --> 00:14:36,902
I'll tell you something, bro.

123
00:14:36,937 --> 00:14:39,352
This, where we do,

124
00:14:39,387 --> 00:14:42,392
pay for the rent of your studio.

125
00:14:42,427 --> 00:14:45,397
Pay for your fucking records.

126
00:14:47,441 --> 00:14:50,412
Pay for my car even!

127
00:14:50,447 --> 00:14:53,412
Do not want to go back
the projects?

128
00:14:53,447 --> 00:14:56,435
I do not want any projects

129
00:14:56,470 --> 00:14:59,423
just want to be legitimate.

130
00:14:59,458 --> 00:15:01,432
I want respect.

131
00:15:01,467 --> 00:15:05,439
As we walk in clubs
not all bitches?

132
00:15:05,474 --> 00:15:10,443
Did not scare niggas all,
Do not crouch with drinks?

133
00:15:11,485 --> 00:15:14,450
How do you want more respect?

134
00:15:15,492 --> 00:15:18,463
You know what your problem is?

135
00:15:18,498 --> 00:15:22,505
Too long to be silly
with industrial Negroes.

136
00:15:23,467 --> 00:15:25,510
They are wrong in the head.

137
00:15:26,512 --> 00:15:31,481
And now you come
and going to confuse me.

138
00:15:50,556 --> 00:15:51,517
Who is it?

139
00:15:52,559 --> 00:15:54,523
Denzel ... I am.

140
00:16:20,610 --> 00:16:24,618
He said he would come straight here
and all night I sit and wait.

141
00:16:24,653 --> 00:16:27,640
I was not his job.

142
00:16:27,675 --> 00:16:30,593
I called the studio was not there.

143
00:16:30,628 --> 00:16:33,559
What do you, check me now?
You know I love it!

144
00:16:33,594 --> 00:16:38,608
Not show such disrespect.
- What? I'm Dee, remember?

145
00:16:38,643 --> 00:16:43,612
Let's stop this game that I
apparently do not know what to do with Gage.

146
00:16:43,647 --> 00:16:47,624
Why did you injure?
- Do not bitch me out, Diamond,

147
00:16:47,659 --> 00:16:51,667
Your job is what you do,
but when it affects me,

148
00:16:51,702 --> 00:16:54,637
I have the right to rule.

149
00:16:54,672 --> 00:16:58,644
Dear, when they met,
You were so nice.

150
00:16:58,679 --> 00:17:04,650
So nice that not only is unbelievable.
I just wanted to'm your girl.

151
00:17:05,692 --> 00:17:09,699
But I grew up, and you still move
with Gage and playing Batman and Robin.

152
00:17:09,734 --> 00:17:12,670
Are not you tired yet?

153
00:17:12,705 --> 00:17:15,675
This has nothing to do with Gage and me.

154
00:17:15,710 --> 00:17:18,716
I have some things to doopravyane.
As they do, end the recording.

155
00:17:18,751 --> 00:17:22,740
Since when repeating it, Dee?
- What do not believe me?

156
00:17:22,775 --> 00:17:26,730
Dear, if you do not believe,
I long to go.

157
00:17:26,765 --> 00:17:29,736
Then why do I imbed cycling-friendly?

158
00:17:29,771 --> 00:17:32,741
Because you hold.

159
00:17:33,743 --> 00:17:37,710
And I love ...
and do not want to lose.

160
00:18:09,768 --> 00:18:11,812
Diamond, all night I do not go to bed?

161
00:18:11,847 --> 00:18:13,816
Yes, I write.

162
00:18:15,779 --> 00:18:21,830
I'm half an hour of work.
What do you do?

163
00:18:22,792 --> 00:18:25,838
I'll go see Mom
that something is not good.

164
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:29,805
Yesterday I heard on the phone
I mention nothing.

165
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:32,810
Call me to tell me how it is

166
00:18:33,812 --> 00:18:35,821
OK, I'll call you.

167
00:18:35,856 --> 00:18:38,861
Give me the number of mobile phone,
you to call me.

168
00:18:39,823 --> 00:18:40,825
I can not.

169
00:18:41,867 --> 00:18:43,830
Why? Tisha has a number of her boyfriend.

170
00:18:43,865 --> 00:18:45,839
I know he's henpecked husband.

171
00:18:45,874 --> 00:18:48,879
If it was conditionally released from jail
with those bracelets

172
00:18:48,914 --> 00:18:51,885
where the signal
every time you leave the perimeter.

173
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:55,892
Zar-zar! Tisha here Tisha there ...
- Come on.

174
00:18:56,854 --> 00:19:00,861
I tell you, he cursed the day
which gave her the phone.

175
00:19:01,863 --> 00:19:03,867
Did not.
- On the contrary.

176
00:19:04,868 --> 00:19:07,874
Why do you think
that the first work of doctors is

177
00:19:07,909 --> 00:19:10,917
to cut the umbilical cord of the baby?

178
00:19:10,952 --> 00:19:13,925
For men shall be free.

179
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:15,893
You can roam the earth.

180
00:19:15,928 --> 00:19:21,899
For me, I give you my phone
is like back in the womb.

181
00:19:21,934 --> 00:19:24,905
Laughing because you know that is true.

182
00:19:26,948 --> 00:19:28,912
What do they do?

183
00:19:28,947 --> 00:19:30,956
Love me.

184
00:19:52,956 --> 00:19:54,999
Mom?

185
00:19:55,961 --> 00:19:58,005
I made you breakfast.

186
00:19:58,966 --> 00:20:00,975
Why are you supposed to do?

187
00:20:01,010 --> 00:20:05,017
I told you when I go head
will become.

188
00:20:05,052 --> 00:20:09,025
11 o'clock and ate nothing.

189
00:20:11,028 --> 00:20:12,992
I thought ...

190
00:20:13,994 --> 00:20:16,037
You would not go to work.

191
00:20:16,072 --> 00:20:19,008
Who will pay my bills?

192
00:20:19,043 --> 00:20:22,013
I will take them.
- I know you're out of work.

193
00:20:22,048 --> 00:20:27,017
So money-makers,
are not those I want.

194
00:20:27,052 --> 00:20:29,061
Not so, Mom.
- I do not fool yourself, Diamond.

195
00:20:30,023 --> 00:20:33,068
I am your mother.
I'm not a silly nonsense.

196
00:20:33,103 --> 00:20:34,997
All right.

197
00:20:35,032 --> 00:20:38,037
Show must go.

198
00:20:39,079 --> 00:20:43,087
I'll go in the studio
I will do the recording ...

199
00:20:44,048 --> 00:20:46,092
Tomorrow I will go back to see you.

200
00:20:47,094 --> 00:20:50,099
Sometimes you talk just like his father.

201
00:20:53,105 --> 00:20:56,110
I did not mean in a bad sense.

202
00:21:10,136 --> 00:21:13,141
This is not cool.

203
00:21:15,105 --> 00:21:19,112
Repeat for a week.
There is nothing like the record.

204
00:21:20,154 --> 00:21:23,119
Just not cool and so.

205
00:21:24,161 --> 00:21:28,148
Maybe you need
a little detente.

206
00:21:28,183 --> 00:21:32,136
There is nothing wrong with that
to give time.

207
00:21:34,179 --> 00:21:36,143
Maybe you're right.

208
00:21:38,187 --> 00:21:40,115
Disappear.

209
00:21:40,150 --> 00:21:42,674
Dee, do not forget ...

210
00:21:42,709 --> 00:21:45,199
Do not pay me.

211
00:21:54,176 --> 00:21:56,179
Thank you, bro.
- Please.

212
00:22:16,256 --> 00:22:18,219
Mom?

213
00:22:21,225 --> 00:22:23,268
Mom?

214
00:22:28,237 --> 00:22:30,281
Lord!

215
00:22:31,243 --> 00:22:33,287
Mom!

216
00:22:37,294 --> 00:22:41,261
Quickly send an ambulance.
My mother has fainted.

217
00:22:41,296 --> 00:22:45,268
"Uilkon Street" 301, app. 4-B.

218
00:22:50,317 --> 00:22:53,323
Do not worry, you'll be fine.

219
00:22:55,286 --> 00:22:59,294
Just hang on and everything will be fine.

220
00:23:39,407 --> 00:23:42,412
Sorry about your mother.

221
00:23:46,419 --> 00:23:48,423
If you do not want me here you go,

222
00:23:48,458 --> 00:23:51,388
but had to come.

223
00:23:56,437 --> 00:23:58,401
As for my game play?

224
00:24:01,406 --> 00:24:05,454
Plump,
if not they would be 11 years.

225
00:24:06,456 --> 00:24:10,428
I came to have a last tribute.

226
00:24:10,463 --> 00:24:14,430
I do not expect
to meet me with open arms.

227
00:24:14,465 --> 00:24:17,436
Because definitely will not happen.

228
00:24:19,479 --> 00:24:22,445
Next week
I'll be on this phone.

229
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:25,450
We need to talk.

230
00:24:27,494 --> 00:24:30,499
Why do you think
I want to talk to you?

231
00:24:30,534 --> 00:24:33,505
As I said, you have the phone.

232
00:24:34,506 --> 00:24:37,511
I hope to reflect.

233
00:24:37,546 --> 00:24:40,517
And sorry about your mother.

234
00:24:51,537 --> 00:24:55,505
Your mother knew how to handle
all vats.

235
00:24:56,506 --> 00:25:00,554
Remember ... me when
in a correctional institution

236
00:25:01,556 --> 00:25:05,563
and talk to the supervising officer?
He spitefully.

237
00:25:05,598 --> 00:25:08,568
Wow how I hated it!

238
00:25:11,574 --> 00:25:15,581
But your mother convinced him
give me a second chance.

239
00:25:18,586 --> 00:25:22,594
What happened to your father?
Will not you call him?

240
00:25:24,557 --> 00:25:25,599
I do not know.

241
00:25:26,561 --> 00:25:29,606
You did what?

242
00:25:33,574 --> 00:25:36,619
I've never had a father.

243
00:25:39,625 --> 00:25:41,588
Give him a chance.

244
00:25:42,630 --> 00:25:45,636
Nothing lost.

245
00:26:12,645 --> 00:26:13,686
Are you still playing?

246
00:26:14,648 --> 00:26:16,692
In case.

247
00:26:17,694 --> 00:26:21,200
Want to tell me something?

248
00:26:21,235 --> 00:26:24,706
Do not occur every day.

249
00:26:28,674 --> 00:26:32,681
Son, I'm sorry that I failed.

250
00:26:33,723 --> 00:26:37,730
Sorry I was not up to your mother
and to you.

251
00:26:38,732 --> 00:26:41,737
What else can I say?

252
00:26:43,701 --> 00:26:45,670
I do not know.

253
00:26:45,705 --> 00:26:48,715
For example, why he left us.

254
00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:53,719
Do not give justification for their actions,
because I do not like that.

255
00:26:56,725 --> 00:27:01,774
And what will I see you again
or was it only that?

256
00:27:05,781 --> 00:27:10,750
I have nowhere to live.

257
00:27:11,792 --> 00:27:13,755
I thought to poostana less.

258
00:27:14,757 --> 00:27:17,763
To live it with you if you want.

259
00:27:19,806 --> 00:27:25,817
Work is
I have no where to go.

260
00:27:29,825 --> 00:27:35,836
I thought possible ...
to poostana to you.

261
00:27:39,843 --> 00:27:43,850
Damn it!
But do not you and Sven.

262
00:28:11,861 --> 00:28:14,906
You can sleep on the couch.

263
00:28:33,901 --> 00:28:36,906
These know nothing about us.

264
00:28:37,948 --> 00:28:41,956
As completed, will zavrem
these bastards in their place.

265
00:28:45,963 --> 00:28:48,968
Dee, Check it out what was happening.

266
00:28:52,976 --> 00:28:54,944
How are you, Mr. Bi?
- Gage.

267
00:28:54,979 --> 00:28:57,910
What are you doing
in this sleek restaurant?

268
00:28:57,945 --> 00:29:02,994
You know, I like you
enjoy the hottest dance.

269
00:29:03,029 --> 00:29:05,999
Mr. White is in the music business.
- I know.

270
00:29:07,001 --> 00:29:09,971
Now we know.
- Really?

271
00:29:10,006 --> 00:29:13,974
Your singer presented her Diamond.
You said that you want to hear it.

272
00:29:14,009 --> 00:29:16,984
Diamond? Is he a rapper?

273
00:29:17,019 --> 00:29:21,006
And rap is cool, Mr. White.
- It really is.

274
00:29:21,041 --> 00:29:24,959
Settle it with a manager.
- I'm his manager.

275
00:29:24,994 --> 00:29:29,522
You're a smart boy, but understand what
from the music business?

276
00:29:29,557 --> 00:29:34,050
Understand what these skapanyatsi.
And they want what I want.

277
00:29:34,085 --> 00:29:39,019
Money and drugs ...
Hardly know more than Gage.

278
00:29:39,054 --> 00:29:42,025
I will not go away
this behavior.

279
00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:44,567
Check it out you where you go!

280
00:29:44,602 --> 00:29:47,320
Gage, her going to sit.

281
00:29:47,355 --> 00:29:50,039
Not very welcome.

282
00:29:51,081 --> 00:29:54,086
Yes, it will do.

283
00:30:01,099 --> 00:30:04,070
How did it go?
- Hell motherfucker!

284
00:30:04,105 --> 00:30:07,035
I'm sick to play
a whistle at all!

285
00:30:07,070 --> 00:30:11,117
Fuck demokasetata!
- What are you talking about?

286
00:30:12,119 --> 00:30:15,125
How many more records
you need the album?

287
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:19,132
We like to fix it yourself?

288
00:30:20,094 --> 00:30:22,137
Right now we pay?

289
00:30:24,101 --> 00:30:28,148
And where will find the money
for the whole album?

290
00:30:29,150 --> 00:30:34,119
You know,
recently behave as zhenka.

291
00:30:35,161 --> 00:30:38,126
And to tell you the only way
to get a recording deal

292
00:30:38,161 --> 00:30:41,132
to suck dick of Mr. White.

293
00:30:42,174 --> 00:30:44,137
Fuck you!

294
00:31:27,255 --> 00:31:30,261
What you said Seamus?

295
00:31:32,224 --> 00:31:34,268
Nothing.

296
00:31:39,237 --> 00:31:42,243
He wanted to go to a party in them.

297
00:31:44,286 --> 00:31:46,770
Tonight Is the party?

298
00:31:46,805 --> 00:31:49,052
At 2:00 at night?

299
00:31:49,087 --> 00:31:51,299
Is he still here?

300
00:31:52,301 --> 00:31:55,306
Maybe I just wanted to go.

301
00:31:57,270 --> 00:31:58,277
Only two, eh?

302
00:31:58,312 --> 00:32:01,317
I told him that I'm not.

303
00:32:02,319 --> 00:32:09,332
Listen ...
Go and tell this slimy bastard,

304
00:32:10,294 --> 00:32:13,264
that his wound.

305
00:32:13,299 --> 00:32:16,310
And get his address.

306
00:32:16,345 --> 00:32:20,312
But just to give him your phone!

307
00:32:20,347 --> 00:32:23,357
Got it?
- Yes.

308
00:32:24,319 --> 00:32:27,324
All right. I'll wait outside.

309
00:32:31,332 --> 00:32:33,375
Go fix.

310
00:32:51,368 --> 00:32:53,377
Who is it?
- Jane.

311
00:32:53,412 --> 00:32:56,417
Re early, girl.
Wait, get off.

312
00:33:07,437 --> 00:33:14,450
Pedal unhappy.
- What are you doing?

313
00:33:14,485 --> 00:33:16,414
Shut up!

314
00:33:17,455 --> 00:33:19,419
Get up, nigga!

315
00:33:20,461 --> 00:33:23,426
Bass that and make-up!
Where is your money?

316
00:33:23,461 --> 00:33:26,432
I have no money, man.
- None, eh?

317
00:33:28,475 --> 00:33:32,443
Bastard!
- Calm down.

318
00:33:33,444 --> 00:33:35,453
More quietly.
- Shut up!

319
00:33:35,488 --> 00:33:39,455
What crawl as zhenka, come!

320
00:33:39,490 --> 00:33:42,501
Get in here, nigga!

321
00:33:44,505 --> 00:33:46,468
Where is the money?

322
00:33:47,470 --> 00:33:49,514
Come here. Move!

323
00:33:51,517 --> 00:33:53,446
Open the cupboard!

324
00:33:53,481 --> 00:33:55,525
Where are they?
- There is nothing here.

325
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:59,532
Marsh there!

326
00:34:02,537 --> 00:34:04,501
Motherfucker, where's the money?

327
00:34:06,544 --> 00:34:09,550
Your old Mom ...

328
00:34:10,512 --> 00:34:12,555
Put them envelopes!

329
00:34:13,557 --> 00:34:15,561
Put them all.

330
00:34:15,596 --> 00:34:17,524
All the money!

331
00:34:21,532 --> 00:34:24,537
Thank you very much, Seamus.

332
00:34:25,539 --> 00:34:27,583
Almost forgot ...

333
00:34:27,618 --> 00:34:29,586
Damn it.

334
00:34:32,552 --> 00:34:36,599
This is bullshit!
I hear only the bass.

335
00:34:36,634 --> 00:34:40,606
Is cool, I tell you! Is super!

336
00:34:41,568 --> 00:34:45,575
What's the point of recording something
if you do not hear the melody?

337
00:34:45,610 --> 00:34:49,583
I tell you, this is the new sound.
I know his work.

338
00:34:49,618 --> 00:34:52,588
Di, we must speak.

339
00:34:52,623 --> 00:34:54,632
Fix it!

340
00:35:00,643 --> 00:35:02,606
What is it?

341
00:35:03,608 --> 00:35:05,612
Hopefully for good.

342
00:35:06,613 --> 00:35:10,621
Sorry, Diamond, but I
you run credit studio time.

343
00:35:10,656 --> 00:35:12,589
Cry me upload my price.

344
00:35:12,624 --> 00:35:16,130
I know you have talent.
Why do you think they took?

345
00:35:16,165 --> 00:35:19,637
Then let me breathe
to finish their demo!

346
00:35:20,639 --> 00:35:24,686
Dee, my clients recorded an entire CD,
while your kid is a demo.

347
00:35:24,721 --> 00:35:26,615
Yes, but my sound is cool.

348
00:35:26,650 --> 00:35:30,657
--> I do not sell albums
and studio time. So pay my rent.

349
00:35:30,692 --> 00:35:34,664
How are the damages?
- 1.50 per hour.

350
00:35:39,714 --> 00:35:42,719
Okay, I think.

351
00:35:54,701 --> 00:35:59,715
No wonder that its water goals.
In such a jerk ...

352
00:35:59,750 --> 00:36:04,719
Only one highway ...
- I will not bother you.

353
00:36:05,721 --> 00:36:06,763
Fired.

354
00:36:07,724 --> 00:36:11,732
Fire me?
- That said.

355
00:36:12,774 --> 00:36:15,739
Get out of here.

356
00:36:17,783 --> 00:36:19,786
Come on, get out!

357
00:36:36,777 --> 00:36:39,783
What are you doing here?
- What are you saying was, bro?

358
00:36:44,832 --> 00:36:48,819
--> What is it?
- I'm your manager, or not?

359
00:36:48,854 --> 00:36:52,806
Of course.
- I told you that I get serious?

360
00:36:53,808 --> 00:36:58,817
Right? I told you it was time
to go into the league, huh?

361
00:36:58,852 --> 00:37:03,826
What nonsense babble?
- I'm talking to you make an album.

362
00:37:03,861 --> 00:37:07,833
And I'm telling you,
we do not have much money.

363
00:37:10,839 --> 00:37:12,883
Already have.

364
00:37:13,844 --> 00:37:16,850
Ready to play?

365
00:37:18,894 --> 00:37:21,899
Where did you get so much money?

366
00:37:22,901 --> 00:37:25,906
Lucky me.
Are you ready tell me!

367
00:37:26,868 --> 00:37:28,912
What is it, bro?

368
00:37:29,914 --> 00:37:32,919
When Jesus healed the blind,

369
00:37:33,881 --> 00:37:36,926
I asked him blind
how did it?

370
00:37:36,961 --> 00:37:39,932
You are not Jesus and I'm not blind.

371
00:37:49,950 --> 00:37:51,878
Decide what?

372
00:37:51,913 --> 00:37:54,919
My arm is tired.

373
00:38:16,999 --> 00:38:18,963
Yes?

374
00:38:21,006 --> 00:38:22,970
Are you sure?

375
00:38:25,014 --> 00:38:28,981
One hundred percent?
- Let me show you sample?

376
00:38:29,983 --> 00:38:32,988
I am pregnant.

377
00:38:36,995 --> 00:38:39,039
Will act properly?

378
00:38:40,001 --> 00:38:42,009
Which is correct?

379
00:38:42,044 --> 00:38:45,050
Whatever you choose,
you support me.

380
00:38:45,085 --> 00:38:47,013
To choose?

381
00:38:48,055 --> 00:38:51,040
I'm not ready to be a father.

382
00:38:51,075 --> 00:38:54,026
Not ready or not?

383
00:38:56,070 --> 00:38:58,033
Do you know how things are my
to the head?

384
00:38:59,075 --> 00:39:03,083
Already quite unintentionally.
So I am for myself only care.

385
00:39:03,118 --> 00:39:05,086
You will be my child turning up.
What are you doing?

386
00:39:05,121 --> 00:39:07,015
I own and look to the child

387
00:39:07,050 --> 00:39:11,057
but I want it to be a father
and not some street thug.

388
00:39:11,177 --> 00:39:12,860
I want a real man
that is to my child.

389
00:39:12,981 --> 00:39:15,705
Can you imagine this man, Diamond?
Listen, let her fix things

390
00:39:15,866 --> 00:39:19,112
and then we'll sit down and talk
the idea of ??family.

391
00:39:19,147 --> 00:39:21,040
Now, however,
is not the time for family.

392
00:39:21,075 --> 00:39:25,083
And I have not planned it,
but it was written.

393
00:39:25,118 --> 00:39:27,126
I will not tell you what to do.

394
00:39:28,088 --> 00:39:30,132
Ultimately, you decide.

395
00:39:30,167 --> 00:39:32,095
No, dear ...

396
00:39:33,137 --> 00:39:35,066
It is wrong here.

397
00:39:35,101 --> 00:39:38,106
I need
and you can participate in the decision.

398
00:39:38,141 --> 00:39:41,117
Then ...
- Yes?

399
00:39:41,152 --> 00:39:43,155
I want to participate in the decision?

400
00:39:43,190 --> 00:39:47,128
Well, I decide not to have a baby.

401
00:39:47,163 --> 00:39:50,168
But I can not guarantee
I will be next to you

402
00:39:51,170 --> 00:39:52,097
If you decide to keep it.

403
00:39:52,132 --> 00:39:54,656
Put your cards on the table
and I'm just down to earth.

404
00:39:54,691 --> 00:39:57,181
I do not want to have misunderstandings
or confusion.

405
00:39:58,183 --> 00:40:01,153
Clearly. You want to land.

406
00:40:01,188 --> 00:40:05,175
You can then run Gage the moment
which you call

407
00:40:05,210 --> 00:40:09,163
though his wife,
but can not support his child.

408
00:40:10,164 --> 00:40:12,208
What kind of man are you, Diamond?

409
00:40:15,213 --> 00:40:18,219
I can not believe it.

410
00:41:18,288 --> 00:41:21,258
Finally saw the light, eh?

411
00:41:21,293 --> 00:41:24,339
If you do,
will do it properly.

412
00:41:24,374 --> 00:41:26,302
Haliluya.

413
00:41:27,344 --> 00:41:30,350
Without games.
- You give me hundred grand?

414
00:41:31,352 --> 00:41:33,355
Why do you harness that?

415
00:41:34,357 --> 00:41:39,326
That's my music
and no one to fuck with her.

416
00:41:40,368 --> 00:41:42,371
This I say.

417
00:41:42,406 --> 00:41:44,375
Relax, bro.

418
00:41:45,337 --> 00:41:48,383
This is me - Gage.
You are together in kyupa.

419
00:41:48,418 --> 00:41:51,388
Forever ... Until the end.

420
00:42:47,450 --> 00:42:50,495
Bro, will break!
Real hit!

421
00:42:51,457 --> 00:42:54,963
I tell you, will break all.

422
00:42:54,998 --> 00:42:58,470
Smiley, please shut up for a while.

423
00:43:24,557 --> 00:43:28,063
How are you, Gage?
What brother?

424
00:43:28,098 --> 00:43:31,570
Is well f.
- Tonight is frashkano.

425
00:43:39,544 --> 00:43:45,595
Are you ready for tonight?
- He is always ready. Right?

426
00:47:09,926 --> 00:47:13,933
I tried to sleep.
- Sit down, I prepared something to eat.

427
00:47:19,944 --> 00:47:23,951
That was my music.
What do you say?

428
00:47:26,957 --> 00:47:30,002
Was.
- Should I?

429
00:47:32,006 --> 00:47:34,971
Maybe you just should not ask me.
- No.

430
00:47:36,013 --> 00:47:37,977
Say what it is,

431
00:47:43,026 --> 00:47:47,995
Too mechanized ...
You know, no feeling.

432
00:47:48,030 --> 00:47:51,001
Pressure but no thrill.

433
00:47:52,002 --> 00:47:56,050
The problem is that you grew up
with electronic music.

434
00:47:57,052 --> 00:48:01,059
You think these keyboards
sound like a real piano.

435
00:48:02,021 --> 00:48:04,029
Not so.

436
00:48:04,064 --> 00:48:06,028
Let me show you something.

437
00:48:17,088 --> 00:48:19,051
Play me something.

438
00:48:23,059 --> 00:48:27,106
Make this plastic
sounds like a piano.

439
00:48:49,146 --> 00:48:51,150
Not bad, eh?

440
00:48:52,152 --> 00:48:54,636
Come on, put.

441
00:48:54,671 --> 00:48:56,917
Where are we going?

442
00:48:56,952 --> 00:48:59,164
In my time.

443
00:50:20,271 --> 00:50:22,315
Damn it.

444
00:50:24,319 --> 00:50:26,282
How you would?

445
00:50:35,339 --> 00:50:38,344
I want to get a package from Frank.

446
00:50:39,346 --> 00:50:41,310
Okay, no problem.

447
00:50:42,351 --> 00:50:43,313
Watch your back.

448
00:50:44,315 --> 00:50:46,324
All right.

449
00:50:46,359 --> 00:50:49,364
Did you hear that Seamus is it clean?

450
00:50:51,328 --> 00:50:54,298
Purified it? For what?

451
00:50:54,333 --> 00:50:57,339
He held one of my one hundred grand.
- Seamus you?

452
00:50:58,340 --> 00:51:00,309
Seamus does not work for you.

453
00:51:00,344 --> 00:51:04,316
Do little business transaction.

454
00:51:04,351 --> 00:51:08,359
I think this, where it is cleansed,
knew that Seamus has a tutu.

455
00:51:08,394 --> 00:51:10,402
Nasty job.

456
00:51:11,364 --> 00:51:13,408
Then he would hear would.

457
00:51:13,443 --> 00:51:16,378
By the way ...

458
00:51:16,413 --> 00:51:19,419
I heard that doing an album with Diamond.

459
00:51:20,421 --> 00:51:23,426
Small deal, you know.

460
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:33,444
Naturally.

461
00:51:34,446 --> 00:51:37,451
And where did you get the money for the album?

462
00:51:38,413 --> 00:51:40,416
Not cost us any money.

463
00:51:40,451 --> 00:51:42,420
Marshall put our stew.

464
00:51:43,462 --> 00:51:46,393
Really?
- Yes.

465
00:51:46,428 --> 00:51:48,471
How kind of him.

466
00:51:51,477 --> 00:51:53,961
False dirty bastard!

467
00:51:53,996 --> 00:51:56,446
You are cleansed Seamus.

468
00:51:58,490 --> 00:52:01,495
I have not touched.
- I do not care what their rights.

469
00:52:02,457 --> 00:52:05,502
He was fucking garbage.
I want my money.

470
00:52:06,464 --> 00:52:08,508
Not me.

471
00:52:10,471 --> 00:52:15,521
What's wrong with you saw me?
Nasty I even looking.

472
00:52:18,526 --> 00:52:20,455
Was hungry.

473
00:52:20,490 --> 00:52:23,495
Want fresh mestse?

474
00:52:24,497 --> 00:52:26,500
I want my steak to be thin.

475
00:52:28,544 --> 00:52:31,510
Your make them as you want.
We have a chainsaw.

476
00:52:34,515 --> 00:52:36,518
Give chainsaw.

477
00:52:36,553 --> 00:52:38,522
And you sit down.

478
00:52:42,570 --> 00:52:46,577
Include in January
I want to show Gage's how it works.

479
00:52:58,559 --> 00:53:02,566
What you choose, Gage?
A thick or thin?

480
00:53:06,613 --> 00:53:09,544
Good!
I got your fucking money!

481
00:53:09,579 --> 00:53:12,584
I know you took them.
What did you do with them?

482
00:53:13,626 --> 00:53:16,631
I used it for Diamond album.

483
00:53:22,602 --> 00:53:27,651
Why not say from the beginning?
Do you think you know?

484
00:53:27,686 --> 00:53:31,624
It would, I told you ...
I did not know Seamus works for you.

485
00:53:31,659 --> 00:53:35,626
But as I told you that someone has purged
and I took the hundred grand,

486
00:53:36,628 --> 00:53:39,633
why not confessed?
Just had to say:

487
00:53:39,668 --> 00:53:43,157
"Sorry, Mr. Bi.
Your money back. "

488
00:53:43,192 --> 00:53:46,646
I was afraid, I was half-afraid.
- Are you scared?

489
00:53:47,688 --> 00:53:51,695
But with pleasure spend my money
and got a music producer!

490
00:53:51,730 --> 00:53:55,702
Look now at what sank shit.
- You, see ...

491
00:53:55,737 --> 00:53:57,666
Diamond has nothing to do.

492
00:53:58,708 --> 00:54:01,678
I have nothing against
music industry.

493
00:54:01,713 --> 00:54:05,721
And who knows ...
This may be a blessing.

494
00:54:37,739 --> 00:54:40,784
When I was a child,
I just wanted to play.

495
00:54:42,788 --> 00:54:46,795
I was waiting for his big chance
which never came.

496
00:54:47,797 --> 00:54:52,766
And when I stopped to hope
I stopped to believe in myself.

497
00:54:54,770 --> 00:54:56,813
Then soaked.

498
00:54:57,815 --> 00:55:03,826
You know, Diamond, in your eyes
I see my determination of youth.

499
00:55:04,828 --> 00:55:07,798
I had a beautiful woman, child ...

500
00:55:07,833 --> 00:55:11,840
And they infect, because I,
that music is more important.

501
00:55:12,802 --> 00:55:16,810
It crushed me, son.
Do you understand?

502
00:55:17,851 --> 00:55:19,815
I finished it.

503
00:56:48,977 --> 00:56:51,020
Who is it?
- I am.

504
00:56:52,984 --> 00:56:55,989
What are you doing here?
- I want to talk to you.

505
00:57:01,039 --> 00:57:02,967
Come on, do not act like that.

506
00:57:03,002 --> 00:57:06,008
Did not behave
I'm pregnant.

507
00:57:07,009 --> 00:57:09,053
Just hear me out.

508
00:57:10,015 --> 00:57:12,059
They listen.

509
00:57:13,020 --> 00:57:18,035
I love you
and I want to watch this baby with you.

510
00:57:18,070 --> 00:57:24,040
Last time we talked,
You do not want to have anything to do with it.

511
00:57:24,075 --> 00:57:27,011
I bring you something
I want to hear.

512
00:57:27,046 --> 00:57:30,051
When released,
will forever change our lives.

513
00:57:31,053 --> 00:57:34,059
Yours and that of my baby.

514
00:57:44,077 --> 00:57:47,082
Diamond, I believe you
and I want to trust you,

515
00:57:47,117 --> 00:57:50,093
but the things which He spoke to me ...

516
00:57:50,128 --> 00:57:54,095
I so easily forget them.

517
00:57:54,130 --> 00:57:55,062
I can not.

518
00:57:55,097 --> 00:57:59,104
I'll be with you.

519
00:58:11,166 --> 00:58:13,170
Yes?
What is it?

520
00:58:15,133 --> 00:58:16,135
What?

521
00:58:17,177 --> 00:58:19,140
Silly me.

522
00:58:20,182 --> 00:58:22,146
What did Mr. White?

523
00:58:23,148 --> 00:58:26,153
Well, Gage, come. Wait for me.

524
00:59:14,240 --> 00:59:16,249
Diamond, my man!

525
00:59:16,284 --> 00:59:21,253
You know, Mr. White?
- Call me Johnny. Come, sit down!

526
00:59:26,302 --> 00:59:29,307
Diamond does not think
I want to push forward

527
00:59:29,342 --> 00:59:32,313
I just decided it was time
Johnny you to know.

528
00:59:32,348 --> 00:59:34,242
Diamond will not drop.

529
00:59:34,277 --> 00:59:38,284
I would not be here if I did not think
that your music is cool.

530
00:59:39,326 --> 00:59:42,256
Its my music heard?
- Posted on Johnny this and that,

531
00:59:42,291 --> 00:59:46,339
only to inflame the appetite.
- And what I heard, were money!

532
00:59:46,374 --> 00:59:49,269
You know?
- The album is not yet finished.

533
00:59:49,304 --> 00:59:53,351
Because you're a perfectionist.
I love this band in his.

534
00:59:53,386 --> 00:59:56,317
You can trust me,
I know when something is hit.

535
00:59:56,352 --> 00:59:59,322
As launch this album
will blow the market.

536
01:00:02,328 --> 01:00:05,333
No offense, Mr. White

537
01:00:06,335 --> 01:00:08,379
but what do you mean
this "we"?

538
01:00:09,340 --> 01:00:12,311
Diamond, just listen to people.
- No, nothing.

539
01:00:12,346 --> 01:00:17,395
When Diamond is ready
will sit down and think of something together.

540
01:00:19,359 --> 01:00:21,883
Thanks for your time,
Mr. White,

541
01:00:21,918 --> 01:00:24,408
but I work in the studio.
- I understand.

542
01:00:24,443 --> 01:00:27,413
I was glad to talk.

543
01:00:29,377 --> 01:00:31,420
I will settle it.

544
01:00:38,433 --> 01:00:40,397
Hey, Dee?

545
01:00:48,451 --> 01:00:52,459
What man?
Do not talk to me anymore?

546
01:00:53,420 --> 01:00:56,466
I told you
do not fuck with my music.

547
01:00:56,501 --> 01:00:59,436
What captures was?

548
01:00:59,471 --> 01:01:02,442
Would you do service
they associated with Mr. White.

549
01:01:02,477 --> 01:01:06,484
Would not anyone do services.
Apparently he will get something!

550
01:01:06,519 --> 01:01:10,491
I told you
just trying to help you.

551
01:01:11,453 --> 01:01:13,462
Seriously.

552
01:01:13,497 --> 01:01:15,425
The last time they ask -

553
01:01:15,460 --> 01:01:20,509
What happens between you and Mr. Bi?
- Okay, see ...

554
01:01:21,471 --> 01:01:23,480
The situation is this:

555
01:01:23,515 --> 01:01:27,522
I am robbed Seamus,
He vartyal a deal with Mr. Bi.

556
01:01:28,484 --> 01:01:32,511
A secret history, did not know about it.
- Why not me?

557
01:01:32,546 --> 01:01:36,539
Because it was between me and Mr. Bi.
- And now I would want my album.

558
01:01:36,574 --> 01:01:39,041
I said it early -

559
01:01:39,076 --> 01:01:41,473
Do not fuck with my music.

560
01:01:41,508 --> 01:01:46,517
Listen, you will find the money to Mr. Bi.
- How will bring 100 grand?

561
01:01:47,559 --> 01:01:49,522
Knockouts have a deal.

562
01:01:50,564 --> 01:01:52,493
I have a buyer for 6 pounds.

563
01:01:52,528 --> 01:01:54,571
He said he would give me 100 grand
If the drug is good.

564
01:01:55,533 --> 01:01:58,544
Where you'll find six pounds?
- Already have them.

565
01:01:58,579 --> 01:02:02,546
Sell ??their drugs to Mr. Bi
lighter and collected their excess?

566
01:02:02,581 --> 01:02:05,591
Are you mad at?!
- No, I'm not!

567
01:02:05,626 --> 01:02:08,562
Who gets rich without sweating?

568
01:02:08,597 --> 01:02:11,567
And let the album
Would not we need.

569
01:02:11,602 --> 01:02:15,609
But now he has to refund money
to get out of our back.

570
01:02:15,644 --> 01:02:17,538
With me?

571
01:02:17,573 --> 01:02:21,620
No. This time bomb will explode
in our faces.

572
01:02:22,622 --> 01:02:24,591
Still talking about how you want to be legitimate.

573
01:02:24,626 --> 01:02:28,132
Let me tell you something.
Nobody will give you something for nothing.

574
01:02:28,167 --> 01:02:31,639
If you want something in this world,
he has to take it.

575
01:02:31,674 --> 01:02:35,646
As did all
went to Wall Street.

576
01:02:37,609 --> 01:02:41,617
I ask you ...
Would you like it or not?

577
01:02:56,684 --> 01:02:58,648
Yes?

578
01:03:06,702 --> 01:03:09,687
Are you sure that is not footcloth?

579
01:03:09,722 --> 01:03:12,673
Because I do not believe these bastards.

580
01:03:14,677 --> 01:03:17,722
Do not give up, just share.

581
01:03:19,686 --> 01:03:21,689
All right.

582
01:03:22,691 --> 01:03:24,735
I will go.

583
01:03:26,739 --> 01:03:28,702
You do not need to die, Diamond.

584
01:03:29,704 --> 01:03:31,748
Can.

585
01:03:32,709 --> 01:03:34,718
Must go together.

586
01:03:34,753 --> 01:03:36,682
Scared,
why move with Gage.

587
01:03:36,717 --> 01:03:40,764
Because if it did not happen this time,
will succeed next time.

588
01:03:40,799 --> 01:03:43,729
Do you think I do this?

589
01:03:44,771 --> 01:03:47,742
Do you believe
it's really nice to do it?

590
01:03:47,777 --> 01:03:51,784
I like your music.
- Then get out of it.

591
01:03:51,819 --> 01:03:54,789
Really?
Yes, you have experience in the neighborhood.

592
01:03:54,824 --> 01:03:57,795
Easily attaches to you.
- You are right.

593
01:03:57,830 --> 01:03:59,723
Then I was easy.

594
01:03:59,758 --> 01:04:03,765
But you my removal was
my biggest mistake, and sorry!

595
01:04:03,800 --> 01:04:06,788
But if you want future
should get out of this a life.

596
01:04:06,823 --> 01:04:09,777
And if the only reason
come was to say that -

597
01:04:09,812 --> 01:04:12,822
then still make sense.

598
01:04:56,902 --> 01:05:00,909
You do not have to do it.
- Bro, everything is agreed.

599
01:05:01,871 --> 01:05:06,920
And when we do,
Mr. It will go away from us forever.

600
01:05:10,928 --> 01:05:13,933
You just say,
I do not care about Mr. Bi.

601
01:05:13,968 --> 01:05:15,897
Let's take the album.

602
01:05:16,898 --> 01:05:19,904
We can always make another one.

603
01:05:19,939 --> 01:05:22,909
Listen, do it and point.

604
01:05:24,953 --> 01:05:27,958
I do not melt right now.

605
01:05:34,971 --> 01:05:37,977
Smile, listen ...

606
01:05:38,978 --> 01:05:42,946
I want to call me
a mobile phone after 10 minutes.

607
01:05:43,948 --> 01:05:45,991
How much is it?

608
01:05:46,953 --> 01:05:50,960
Yes, call me where you want,
only be clear after 10 minutes?

609
01:05:52,002 --> 01:05:53,966
All right.

610
01:05:56,009 --> 01:05:59,015
If we are not finished after 10 minutes
end.

611
01:06:00,017 --> 01:06:03,022
And what a Smiley will save us?

612
01:06:03,057 --> 01:06:06,989
Not serious. Come on.

613
01:06:49,066 --> 01:06:50,073
Do I wear anything?

614
01:06:50,108 --> 01:06:54,115
If I knew it would make a meeting,
would lead to more friends.

615
01:06:54,150 --> 01:06:58,122
The neighborhood is not safe.
- Look, let's do the job.

616
01:07:01,128 --> 01:07:03,131
Show what you wear.

617
01:07:03,166 --> 01:07:05,100
I want to count them.

618
01:07:05,135 --> 01:07:10,104
After seeing cocaine
will sit down and count every dollar.

619
01:07:11,146 --> 01:07:13,109
Show him a sample.
- I do not want a sample.

620
01:07:14,111 --> 01:07:17,082
I want to see six pounds now!

621
01:07:17,117 --> 01:07:21,164
Do not you want to try this before?
- Do you have them or not?

622
01:07:21,199 --> 01:07:22,131
We have them.

623
01:07:22,166 --> 01:07:27,135
How not, will come with the product
not sure in you!

624
01:07:27,170 --> 01:07:30,140
You can count the money
after receiving the drug.

625
01:07:30,175 --> 01:07:33,146
It sure enough is you?

626
01:07:34,147 --> 01:07:37,153
Go bring it.

627
01:07:37,188 --> 01:07:39,197
Relax.

628
01:07:41,160 --> 01:07:44,166
Put the gun on the table.

629
01:07:46,209 --> 01:07:48,173
You, too.

630
01:07:56,228 --> 01:07:59,233
Mobifonat.

631
01:08:00,235 --> 01:08:01,162
Yes?

632
01:08:01,197 --> 01:08:05,204
Why are you calling this number?
I forbade you to do?

633
01:08:05,239 --> 01:08:09,211
I have not been with no bitch last night.
What the fuck ...

634
01:08:10,253 --> 01:08:13,759
And do not call me ...
Listen, now I can not speak.

635
01:08:13,794 --> 01:08:17,231
Large male, not As.
His wife keeps him henpecked.

636
01:08:17,266 --> 01:08:21,273
Do not call me that will come
and I will bust your ass, bitch!

637
01:08:21,308 --> 01:08:23,277
No, Fuck you!

638
01:08:56,297 --> 01:08:58,305
What is this?

639
01:08:58,340 --> 01:09:01,311
Damn! This is not 100 grand!

640
01:09:01,346 --> 01:09:05,353
From the beginning they knew
that skapanyatsi! Let's get out.

641
01:09:25,389 --> 01:09:27,353
Let's get out.

642
01:09:37,371 --> 01:09:38,373
Shut up!

643
01:09:40,417 --> 01:09:42,420
Shut up!
- What are you doing?

644
01:09:42,455 --> 01:09:45,351
I said go!

645
01:09:45,386 --> 01:09:48,391
We can not leave witnesses.

646
01:09:48,426 --> 01:09:50,435
She is pregnant.

647
01:09:52,398 --> 01:09:54,442
And what will happen
as we pointed out in the sequence?

648
01:09:54,477 --> 01:09:57,448
Gage, it does not even speak English.

649
01:09:57,483 --> 01:09:59,376
Just show us.

650
01:09:59,411 --> 01:10:03,458
When will all this end?
- Do not Wash hands with me!

651
01:10:03,493 --> 01:10:06,424
Together we kyupa until the end.

652
01:10:07,466 --> 01:10:12,435
Go and tell Mr. Bi
Who is the real ghetto superstar!

653
01:10:13,477 --> 01:10:16,442
Gage is a dirty bastard!

654
01:10:19,447 --> 01:10:22,453
Do not do it, she is pregnant.

655
01:10:23,455 --> 01:10:26,460
Let her go.

656
01:10:35,517 --> 01:10:37,480
Let's go.

657
01:10:38,522 --> 01:10:40,451
Fuck you!

658
01:10:40,486 --> 01:10:42,529
I'm not with you.

659
01:10:43,491 --> 01:10:45,500
Good.

660
01:10:45,535 --> 01:10:47,498
Do whatever it takes.

661
01:10:48,540 --> 01:10:51,546
I'll take care of business
as they always do.

662
01:11:41,596 --> 01:11:43,640
I thought you were smarter.

663
01:11:45,604 --> 01:11:49,631
First I fucked
as stole my money

664
01:11:49,666 --> 01:11:53,658
then come and offer me
30 thousand dollars!

665
01:11:57,666 --> 01:11:59,629
Do I look like a fucking asshole?

666
01:12:04,678 --> 01:12:07,684
Hope Diamond album
cost 100 grand.

667
01:12:08,686 --> 01:12:10,689
Give him the chair.

668
01:12:14,697 --> 01:12:18,203
If it was me
now I would pop off.

669
01:12:18,238 --> 01:12:21,709
But Mr. White says
you have to sign a contract.

670
01:12:21,744 --> 01:12:24,715
In the music business
word means nothing.

671
01:12:24,750 --> 01:12:26,643
It was burned several times that.

672
01:12:26,678 --> 01:12:30,686
So that bit of paper to sign,
otherwise it will blow your mind

673
01:12:30,721 --> 01:12:34,693
the entire table
and wipe the puddle of contract.

674
01:12:47,716 --> 01:12:51,724
As you say where is the Diamond
finish it.

675
01:12:57,735 --> 01:13:00,740
Do you think Dee will come?

676
01:13:01,742 --> 01:13:02,784
I do not know.

677
01:13:14,766 --> 01:13:17,791
We are looking for Diamond.
- He is not here.

678
01:13:17,826 --> 01:13:20,817
What is Diamond?
- I do not know.

679
01:13:21,778 --> 01:13:24,784
Your guy owes me 100,000 dollars.

680
01:13:24,819 --> 01:13:27,794
I'll say it very simply.

681
01:13:27,829 --> 01:13:31,796
He paid with my money.
You understand me, because in this business.

682
01:13:33,840 --> 01:13:36,811
I want the record to the Diamond.

683
01:13:36,846 --> 01:13:39,811
I can not give it.
I need his permission.

684
01:13:42,816 --> 01:13:47,866
Record It belongs to me.
Go and take it out.

685
01:13:55,840 --> 01:13:57,884
Put him out back.

686
01:15:03,002 --> 01:15:04,966
Is this it?

687
01:15:11,978 --> 01:15:14,022
Diamond?

688
01:15:15,986 --> 01:15:18,029
I came for their money.

689
01:15:18,991 --> 01:15:21,996
It is not needed to get there.

690
01:15:22,998 --> 01:15:24,040
All right.

691
01:15:25,042 --> 01:15:28,047
Therefore, there is no misunderstanding

692
01:15:28,082 --> 01:15:30,011
I take this record.

693
01:15:35,060 --> 01:15:38,066
All right.
He took what you wanted.

694
01:15:40,029 --> 01:15:43,035
I always knew
you're a smart boy.

695
01:15:46,040 --> 01:15:50,047
By the way ...
How 100,000 dollars sound?

696
01:15:52,091 --> 01:15:54,055
Play it.

697
01:17:22,255 --> 01:17:23,216
Gage!

698
01:18:14,309 --> 01:18:18,316
One year later

699
01:18:23,366 --> 01:18:27,373
David 'Gage' Williams
1976 - 2000

700
01:18:27,408 --> 01:18:31,380
Well, Gage, finished album.

701
01:18:31,415 --> 01:18:33,349
Deed done.

702
01:18:33,384 --> 01:18:38,393
But anyway ...
I always knew that behind my back.

703
01:18:39,355 --> 01:18:42,360
And they will always carry in my heart.

704
01:18:42,395 --> 01:18:45,365
Rest in peace.

705
01:18:48,365 --> 01:18:52,365
