1
00:02:20,273 --> 00:02:23,037
Damn. Had I known
what I know now.

2
00:02:23,109 --> 00:02:24,838
But today cats are different.

3
00:02:24,911 --> 00:02:28,938
We all know selling and competition,
that's what this country's built on.

4
00:02:29,015 --> 00:02:31,882
It's all about one thing:
making money.

5
00:02:31,951 --> 00:02:33,680
Money, baby.
Simple as that.

6
00:02:33,753 --> 00:02:35,744
Evertyhing else is just bullshit.

7
00:02:36,689 --> 00:02:39,249
Money is why people come here
from every country in the world.

8
00:02:39,325 --> 00:02:41,725
It's what the American dream
is all about.

9
00:02:41,794 --> 00:02:44,888
You think people come here from all over
the world to live in East New York...

10
00:02:44,964 --> 00:02:46,363
in Harlem, the South Bronx...

11
00:02:46,432 --> 00:02:51,199
because of the beautiful views,
because of the fucking quality of life?

12
00:02:52,939 --> 00:02:54,668
My name is Victor Rosa.

13
00:02:54,741 --> 00:02:58,575
I'm young, Latin and good-looking,
and I call it like I see it, baby.

14
00:02:58,645 --> 00:03:02,638
'Cause I'm gonna tellyou what I think
whetheryou wanna hear it or not.

15
00:03:02,715 --> 00:03:05,309
'Cause you're not gonna get
bullshit from me. Uh-uh.

16
00:03:05,385 --> 00:03:07,580
I'm a businessman, an entrepreneur...

17
00:03:07,654 --> 00:03:09,815
like Rockefeller and Carnegie.

18
00:03:09,889 --> 00:03:13,381
And in my time a geek motherfucker
like Bill Gates. That's right.

19
00:03:13,459 --> 00:03:16,485
They all did it themselves.
Fought the odds and made a fortune.

20
00:03:16,563 --> 00:03:18,929
So why can't I?
Like them, I got a product.

21
00:03:18,998 --> 00:03:22,195
I sell it aggressively
and I make money-- a lot of it.

22
00:03:22,268 --> 00:03:26,227
It doesn't take advertising to sell my
product-- it pretty much sells it self.

23
00:03:26,306 --> 00:03:29,400
It takes brains to make money
and survive in this business.

24
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:34,138
And that may have been the same
for Rockefeller as it is for Gates...

25
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:38,844
but in what I do, you fuck up, you don 't
just lose one of your stock options.

26
00:03:40,787 --> 00:03:43,153
So we run out of
my boyJimmy's crib.

27
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:46,556
Me and Jimmy, we got into this together
when we was just kids out there...

28
00:03:46,626 --> 00:03:48,594
and we worked our way
from lookouts.

29
00:03:48,661 --> 00:03:53,155
It's my crew, but I honestly
couldn 't do it without Jimmy.

30
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:55,895
And Chedda.
Chedda's a monster, yo.

31
00:03:55,969 --> 00:03:59,530
Not because of his size,
but because he 's all heart, baby.

32
00:03:59,606 --> 00:04:01,870
Blackest motherfucker I know.

33
00:04:02,675 --> 00:04:06,076
Jay. Well,Jay
is a special case.

34
00:04:06,145 --> 00:04:08,909
He 's what you call simple--
an idiot savant.

35
00:04:08,982 --> 00:04:10,973
Sometimes more "idiot " than "savant. "

36
00:04:13,219 --> 00:04:17,679
What we make here is my product--
a heroin mix I call "Empire. "

37
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:19,452
Okay, it works like this.

38
00:04:19,525 --> 00:04:22,221
There are three other dealers
who work this area beside me.

39
00:04:22,295 --> 00:04:25,196
You got Hector's "Exorcist. "

40
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:28,029
You got Tito
who sells his "Severe. "

41
00:04:29,469 --> 00:04:31,994
And then there 's Negro.
That motherfucker's a legend.

42
00:04:32,071 --> 00:04:34,005
Damn good businessman
for a faggot.

43
00:04:34,073 --> 00:04:37,008
Not that I got anything against faggots,
but I gotta give it up to him.

44
00:04:37,076 --> 00:04:40,341
"Dancing Queen " is a dope-ass name
for his shit too.

45
00:04:42,448 --> 00:04:44,609
We al I get our supply
from the same connect--

46
00:04:44,684 --> 00:04:47,175
La Colombiana,
Joanna Menendez.

47
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:02,863
We all sell the same product--just mix
it differently, put our own label on it.

48
00:05:02,935 --> 00:05:05,631
I cut mine the least
because I believe in purity.

49
00:05:05,705 --> 00:05:07,866
Tito, though, cuts his shit
as deep as he can...

50
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:09,874
and gets more packets
per ounce that way...

51
00:05:09,942 --> 00:05:11,569
But I get loyal buyers.

52
00:05:11,644 --> 00:05:13,669
People know Empire
and they look for it.

53
00:05:13,746 --> 00:05:16,271
But dumb-ass Tito can 't even begin
to understand how that works.

54
00:05:16,349 --> 00:05:18,442
That's why he 's
always in some shit.

55
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:21,518
It's a funny thing,
and it might seem hazardous to you...

56
00:05:21,587 --> 00:05:23,919
but we all hang out
in the same places.

57
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:26,982
No need to step
on each other's toes, right?

58
00:05:33,433 --> 00:05:35,901
But for those of you who have
never been in my neighborhood...

59
00:05:35,968 --> 00:05:38,528
we 're split up
into four separate areas.

60
00:05:38,604 --> 00:05:41,095
The meat of it belongs to me.

61
00:05:42,275 --> 00:05:44,539
Exorcist's got some decent spots.

62
00:05:45,545 --> 00:05:48,878
And Negro's is below that--
around Buckner Boulevard.

63
00:05:48,948 --> 00:05:51,815
Severe's got spots next to mine.

64
00:05:51,884 --> 00:05:56,218
As you can see, sometimes they tend
to slip and overlap into my spot.

65
00:05:57,657 --> 00:06:00,626
And when that happens,
you got trouble.

66
00:06:02,295 --> 00:06:04,593
You tryi n' to fuck up my shot, right?.

67
00:06:04,664 --> 00:06:06,495
Vic! Vic!

68
00:06:06,566 --> 00:06:08,329
- What's up?.
- Beef right now, nigga.

69
00:06:08,401 --> 00:06:11,336
- Are you waiting on this shit?.
- Fuck this motherfuckin' game, man!

70
00:06:11,404 --> 00:06:15,773
Yo, word is they got David layin'
in the street like a little bitch, son.

71
00:06:15,842 --> 00:06:18,970
- They beat the shit out ofhim, kid.
- Let's do this motherfucker.

72
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:28,384
Remember when Isaid
Tito was always in some shit?

73
00:06:28,454 --> 00:06:31,480
Well, he was trying to move in
on one of myspots again.

74
00:06:31,557 --> 00:06:33,491
I mean, we're talking
maybe 20 feet...

75
00:06:33,559 --> 00:06:37,359
but that 20 feet was worth
30 grand a week easy.

76
00:06:52,345 --> 00:06:54,336
I got it from my brother G--

77
00:06:56,182 --> 00:06:59,674
you gotta go straight to the leader
and take him down hard.

78
00:07:01,454 --> 00:07:03,319
You do that, and it's over.

79
00:07:03,389 --> 00:07:06,017
- Motherfucker!
- Yeah, nigga, yeah!

80
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:07,389
Fuck me?.

81
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:09,325
Fuck your damn self, fucker!

82
00:07:10,029 --> 00:07:11,894
You're getting your ass kicked!

83
00:07:17,036 --> 00:07:18,799
You fucked up, kid.

84
00:07:18,871 --> 00:07:21,362
You snatched my nut, all right?.

85
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:23,033
You take my nut...

86
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:24,838
I'll fuckin' takeyour nuts,
motherfucker.

87
00:07:24,911 --> 00:07:26,173
You hear me?.

88
00:07:26,245 --> 00:07:28,304
Huh?. I can't hear you,
motherfucker.

89
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:36,515
What the fuck you doin'?.

90
00:07:37,323 --> 00:07:40,417
Lucky I don't blow your mother fuckin'
head off, motherfucker!

91
00:07:40,493 --> 00:07:44,259
- Come on, you motherfucker!
- It's all right, man. Come on.

92
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:46,161
Call me, motherfucker.

93
00:07:46,232 --> 00:07:48,291
You tell Tito to call me.

94
00:07:48,367 --> 00:07:50,892
There's a strange fairness
at work here.

95
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:53,029
Everybody pushes the boundaries
every day.

96
00:07:53,105 --> 00:07:56,040
You push, you push some more
and see how they react.

97
00:07:56,108 --> 00:07:59,407
Yeah, it seems stupid, but remember:
every foot is a dollar.

98
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:01,879
And dollars is the only thing
that matters out here.

99
00:08:09,255 --> 00:08:10,517
Yo, Jason.

100
00:08:14,026 --> 00:08:15,220
What?.

101
00:08:15,294 --> 00:08:17,421
What you mean, what?.
Get over here.

102
00:08:20,066 --> 00:08:21,556
Damn.

103
00:08:24,437 --> 00:08:26,428
What's wrong with you, man?.

104
00:08:28,074 --> 00:08:31,373
Why are you staring at me?.
Did I do something?.

105
00:08:31,444 --> 00:08:34,038
Whyyou gotta do something
for me to stare atyou, man?.

106
00:08:34,113 --> 00:08:36,980
- You know I love you.
- I know.

107
00:08:37,917 --> 00:08:40,545
Well?. You love your daddy?.

108
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:42,053
You know I do.

109
00:08:42,121 --> 00:08:44,487
Well, you gotta tell your daddy
sometime, man.

110
00:08:44,557 --> 00:08:46,320
Whywe gotta go through this?.

111
00:08:46,392 --> 00:08:50,294
We gotta go through it because sometimes
your daddy wanna know you love him too.

112
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:52,456
I'm always loving you,
playing with you.

113
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:54,898
Ain't all about you
all the time, man.

114
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:57,969
I loveyou, Dad.

115
00:08:59,105 --> 00:09:00,800
That didn't hurt. Right?.

116
00:09:00,873 --> 00:09:01,931
Yeah.

117
00:09:02,008 --> 00:09:04,272
Snotty, man. You always--

118
00:09:04,343 --> 00:09:07,335
Get outta here, man.
Go playyour game, man.

119
00:09:11,817 --> 00:09:13,978
Jose's here.
He's all fucked up.

120
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:15,577
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

121
00:09:15,655 --> 00:09:17,589
Jason, go to your room.

122
00:09:18,257 --> 00:09:20,521
What the fuck happened?.

123
00:09:20,593 --> 00:09:21,958
Who did this?.

124
00:09:22,828 --> 00:09:25,763
-I think Empire's trying to make a move.
-You're saying Vic did this toyou?.

125
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:34,172
- I'll find out about this shit.
- Wait a minute, Tito.

126
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,798
He's not exactly moving in.

127
00:09:36,475 --> 00:09:38,500
What the fuck
does "not exactly" mean?.

128
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:41,411
Look, we was chillin', right?.
And I saw David.

129
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:44,415
I don't like that motherfucker,
so I slapped him around a bit.

130
00:09:44,483 --> 00:09:48,715
He ran away like a bitch. Next thing
I know, Vic is movin' in on us, man.

131
00:09:49,388 --> 00:09:50,616
Get me a drink.

132
00:09:51,991 --> 00:09:54,983
What the fuck, man?.
What's the problem?.

133
00:09:55,995 --> 00:09:58,190
I'm tired ofyou, you piece of shit.

134
00:09:58,264 --> 00:10:01,495
- You gonna kill me now, man?.
- Shut the fuck up!

135
00:10:01,567 --> 00:10:05,503
You'd better tell Vic I didn't have
shit to do with this. You hear me?.

136
00:10:05,571 --> 00:10:08,062
I'm fuckin' tired ofyour shit, man.

137
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:10,700
Go home, wash your fuckin' ass.

138
00:10:10,776 --> 00:10:13,904
Tell good-bye to your mother
and your fuckin' kids.

139
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:17,746
Then come back here. Then I'm gonna
kill you, you fuckin' piece of shit!

140
00:10:17,817 --> 00:10:19,409
You hear me?.
We straight?.

141
00:10:19,485 --> 00:10:20,850
- Yeah.
- Is we straight?.

142
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:23,184
- Yeah.
- Get the fuck outta here.

143
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:28,253
I'm gonna go play Playstation
with my son right now.

144
00:10:28,327 --> 00:10:31,319
Nobody'd better fuckin' interrupt me.
You hear me?.

145
00:10:34,533 --> 00:10:38,697
For everybody-- everybody--
money is what life is all about.

146
00:10:38,771 --> 00:10:41,672
Getting it, keeping it,
losing it, holding it...

147
00:10:41,741 --> 00:10:44,232
needing it, living it
and dying for it.

148
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:46,676
You have to look like you got it,
whether you do or not.

149
00:10:46,746 --> 00:10:48,213
That's how you get respect--

150
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:52,114
you gotta put your money on display
the right way.

151
00:10:52,184 --> 00:10:55,779
My brother G knew just how to do it,
and he taught me well.

152
00:10:56,789 --> 00:10:58,723
I need him now.

153
00:10:58,791 --> 00:11:02,283
I mean, not for nothin',
butjust to look at him...

154
00:11:02,361 --> 00:11:04,921
with his G chain...

155
00:11:04,997 --> 00:11:06,988
the old Alpaca sweater...

156
00:11:09,402 --> 00:11:12,667
Grandmaster Flash
and the Furious Five...

157
00:11:12,738 --> 00:11:15,798
agnd, ofcourse, my first pair
of British Walkers.

158
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:20,907
Yep, he was the man...

159
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:23,414
and those were the days.

160
00:11:23,482 --> 00:11:24,881
I miss him.

161
00:11:36,495 --> 00:11:39,157
- Yo, what's up?.
- What's up, I ittle m idget?.

162
00:11:39,231 --> 00:11:41,927
How you doin?.
Where's your moms?.

163
00:11:42,001 --> 00:11:44,401
Who's the little player hater, huh?.

164
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:46,097
Jason, fom Prospect.

165
00:11:46,172 --> 00:11:49,107
Yo, if I askyou somethin',
you promise not to tell my mom?.

166
00:11:49,175 --> 00:11:51,973
No, I don't make no promises.
Just tell me what it is.

167
00:11:52,044 --> 00:11:55,104
My mom don't like me
asking anyone for anything...

168
00:11:55,181 --> 00:11:57,172
but the new Playstation's out.

169
00:11:57,249 --> 00:11:59,149
Cut to the chase.
How much is it?.

170
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:01,049
I think about $400.

171
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,611
No, it ain't.
It's, like, $395.

172
00:12:03,689 --> 00:12:07,022
What ever happened to
water pistols and fuckin' yo-yos, man?.

173
00:12:07,093 --> 00:12:08,924
Wait, wait.

174
00:12:08,994 --> 00:12:12,486
I been saving up mad money, you know,
and my mom be taking it all.

175
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:15,363
- Now I ain't got jack.
- Your mom taking your money?.

176
00:12:15,434 --> 00:12:17,766
- No jack.
- Listen to me.

177
00:12:17,837 --> 00:12:20,931
Tomorrow you go to Boltron's
and you ask for Weebs.

178
00:12:21,006 --> 00:12:24,032
I'm gonna hookyou up with a Playstation
and three games. All right?.

179
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:27,238
- Thanks, Vic. Come on.
- Yo, yo, hold up.

180
00:12:27,313 --> 00:12:30,476
- Come here.
- Whatyou want?.

181
00:12:30,549 --> 00:12:32,483
Yo, I ain't Santa Claus, man.

182
00:12:32,551 --> 00:12:35,315
You're gonna clean my car
for two months...

183
00:12:35,387 --> 00:12:36,820
twice a week.

184
00:12:36,889 --> 00:12:39,619
Make sure that car's clean inside out
or I'm gonna go off on you.

185
00:12:39,692 --> 00:12:41,717
- Damn!
- What?.

186
00:12:41,794 --> 00:12:44,729
- Done.
- All right, get the hell outta here.

187
00:12:52,104 --> 00:12:54,038
There's no tongue
allowed in here.

188
00:12:54,106 --> 00:12:56,097
Yo, Vic, what's up, man?.

189
00:12:59,345 --> 00:13:02,212
That's all right.
He just needs a minute with your girl.

190
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:04,476
Me?. What's up?.
What'd I do?.

191
00:13:05,317 --> 00:13:08,684
Your son's gonna come home with a
Playstation tomorrow. I gave it to him.

192
00:13:08,754 --> 00:13:10,688
- But I didn't--
- Shut the fuck up!

193
00:13:10,756 --> 00:13:12,883
Cheena,just shut the fuck up.

194
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:14,755
- Listen to me.
- I'm sorry.

195
00:13:14,827 --> 00:13:15,987
I'm sorry.

196
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:20,431
He's bringing a Playstation tomorrow
night. Can you understand that?.

197
00:13:20,499 --> 00:13:23,366
I understand.
You got it for him. Thankyou.

198
00:13:23,435 --> 00:13:25,369
I'm gonna check up
on that Playstation...

199
00:13:25,437 --> 00:13:28,497
and ifI don't see it
I'm gonna assume you sold it.

200
00:13:28,574 --> 00:13:29,871
You got me?.

201
00:13:29,942 --> 00:13:32,502
Don't answer.
It doesn't need an answer.

202
00:13:33,512 --> 00:13:36,447
And by the way,
that money your son saved up?.

203
00:13:36,515 --> 00:13:37,914
I want it. Friday.

204
00:13:37,983 --> 00:13:39,382
Okay. Okay.

205
00:13:39,451 --> 00:13:42,318
With the kind of money we make
out here,you can't go to a bank.

206
00:13:42,388 --> 00:13:44,686
You make huge cash deposits
three times a week...

207
00:13:44,757 --> 00:13:47,157
andyou don't think
they're gonna get suspicious?

208
00:13:47,226 --> 00:13:49,160
I got me a $40,000 truck.

209
00:13:49,228 --> 00:13:51,719
I park in one of the poorest
neighborhoods in the country.

210
00:13:51,797 --> 00:13:53,731
But no one touches it.
Why?

211
00:13:53,799 --> 00:13:56,768
Because they know who I am.
Respect, remember?

212
00:13:56,836 --> 00:13:59,771
There 's only so much you can do
with the money without being stupid.

213
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:02,865
Jimmy likes to spend it all
on his crazy safarijungle frurniture.

214
00:14:02,942 --> 00:14:04,705
He loves that shit.

215
00:14:04,777 --> 00:14:07,974
Chedda had the world's
biggest stereo system...

216
00:14:08,047 --> 00:14:10,982
in the world's puniest apartment.

217
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:18,448
Sometimes youjust can 't help
doing something special, though.

218
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:33,695
What's that, 1 7,000?.

219
00:14:46,085 --> 00:14:47,950
- Got you somethi ng.
- Oh, yeah?.

220
00:14:48,954 --> 00:14:50,683
I was always alone...

221
00:14:50,756 --> 00:14:52,724
always had to prove myself...

222
00:14:52,791 --> 00:14:54,816
always had to be better
than everybody.

223
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:56,987
That's the way
you have to be down here.

224
00:14:57,062 --> 00:14:59,257
That is, till I met Carmen.

225
00:15:02,534 --> 00:15:05,230
She 's been my girl
for a long time now.

226
00:15:05,304 --> 00:15:07,238
I don 't mean to brag...

227
00:15:07,306 --> 00:15:10,002
but she 's the only girl
who was ever as smart as me.

228
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:12,009
She 's going to college for her BA...

229
00:15:12,077 --> 00:15:14,807
and we 've been living together now
for about a year...

230
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,814
which makes her moms crazy.

231
00:15:16,882 --> 00:15:19,976
I mean, who wants their daughter
to be a drug dealer's honey, right?

232
00:15:20,052 --> 00:15:22,919
But Carmen 's mom hated me
from the get-go.

233
00:15:22,988 --> 00:15:25,149
Carmen doesn 't like what I do...

234
00:15:25,224 --> 00:15:28,159
but she don 't have any illusions
about a guy like me either.

235
00:15:28,227 --> 00:15:30,286
It's times like this
that make it all worthwhile.

236
00:15:30,362 --> 00:15:35,197
Evertyhing that happens, all this shit,
itjust disappears.

237
00:15:38,037 --> 00:15:39,561
Look at that.

238
00:15:39,638 --> 00:15:41,128
You look beautiful.

239
00:16:09,134 --> 00:16:12,570
I wish I could've told Carmen I could
never really stop or slow down...

240
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:14,765
'cause I could never stop
or slow down.

241
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:17,638
I had to keep operating.
My life depended on it.

242
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:21,874
Dealing made me feel alive. I had
to show them. I had to show everybody.

243
00:16:24,283 --> 00:16:25,614
Did you get al I that?.

244
00:16:25,684 --> 00:16:28,847
I couldn't understand what
he was talking about by the end.

245
00:16:29,555 --> 00:16:31,716
I think so. Why?.
Did you read the chapters last night?.

246
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:35,624
I tried.
It's just so damn boring.

247
00:16:36,729 --> 00:16:39,061
I want to showyou something.

248
00:16:39,131 --> 00:16:41,827
Lookwhat Vic got me.
Isn't it beautiful?.

249
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:43,925
- Is ityour birthday?.
- No.

250
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:46,563
Hejust got it for me
out ofthe blue.

251
00:16:46,638 --> 00:16:47,798
Oh, my God.

252
00:16:47,873 --> 00:16:51,206
Carmen, these diamonds,
they're huge.

253
00:16:51,276 --> 00:16:53,210
I don't even wanna tell you
where he bought it.

254
00:16:53,278 --> 00:16:57,442
I mean, this must have cost
at least $15,000-$20,000.

255
00:16:57,516 --> 00:16:59,450
- No way.
- Yes!

256
00:17:00,119 --> 00:17:01,882
What does your boyfriend do?.

257
00:17:03,922 --> 00:17:05,685
He's in business.

258
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:08,023
Business?.

259
00:17:09,395 --> 00:17:13,593
What business is he in that he can buy
a $20,000 necklace for no reason?.

260
00:17:13,665 --> 00:17:15,098
Don't answer that.

261
00:17:15,167 --> 00:17:18,102
Listen, I gotta get going.
My boyfriend's having a party tonight.

262
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:21,401
- Why don'tyou and Vic come by?.
- Yeah-- You sure?.

263
00:17:21,473 --> 00:17:25,409
Yeah. I mean, it's all his friends.
I'd love to have someone to talk to.

264
00:17:25,477 --> 00:17:29,311
It's a cocktail party-- kinda dressy.
Your necklace will look fabulous.

265
00:17:29,381 --> 00:17:31,246
Well, I'll be there.

266
00:17:31,316 --> 00:17:35,275
Bring that boyfriend. I wanna see
who's taking such good care ofyou.

267
00:17:35,354 --> 00:17:39,154
- You're not gonna have lunch?.
- No. And I can't find a match either.

268
00:17:39,224 --> 00:17:41,124
- Bye.
- Bye.

269
00:17:42,227 --> 00:17:43,717
Underthe Giuliani dictatorship...

270
00:17:43,796 --> 00:17:46,959
there's more than your usual number
of neighborhood sweeps.

271
00:17:47,032 --> 00:17:51,628
They target a few blocks, try to shut
things down, then move on to the next.

272
00:17:51,703 --> 00:17:53,637
You just gotta frind
a way to survive.

273
00:17:53,705 --> 00:17:57,664
Undercover units are always on the spot,
but they ain 't foolin 'nobody.

274
00:18:00,846 --> 00:18:03,610
There 's always a constant flow
of money out here.

275
00:18:03,682 --> 00:18:06,674
You can't let something like this
stop you or get at you.

276
00:18:10,122 --> 00:18:13,523
So if they're gonna watch you,
then you gotta watch them back.

277
00:18:16,462 --> 00:18:19,659
My God! Where are you goi ng
so beautiful ?.

278
00:18:19,731 --> 00:18:21,289
To a party.

279
00:18:24,203 --> 00:18:26,194
Here's your plate back.
Thank you.

280
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:29,737
You coming straight from the office?.

281
00:18:29,808 --> 00:18:34,074
Yeah, I got a promotion. I'm not a
street pharmacist anymore. I'm a doctor.

282
00:18:34,146 --> 00:18:36,808
Don't start, mami.
We have to go. Kiss.

283
00:18:40,519 --> 00:18:43,386
- Have fun, honey.
- Okay, I'll call you later.

284
00:18:44,323 --> 00:18:45,813
Bye.

285
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:50,590
National Geographic
shoulddo a special on us.

286
00:18:50,662 --> 00:18:52,857
Fuck Bosnia.
I mean, this city, man.

287
00:18:52,931 --> 00:18:55,923
'Cause we got invisible
but well-known boundaries here.

288
00:18:56,001 --> 00:18:58,834
Different ways of life,
different rules, but no mixing.

289
00:18:58,904 --> 00:19:00,895
Drive just a couple miles
over the bridge...

290
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:04,204
and abracadabra,
bodegas turn to fine boutiques...

291
00:19:04,276 --> 00:19:06,608
tenement buildings
turn into brown stones.

292
00:19:06,678 --> 00:19:08,612
Wel l, you gotta have
someplace to go.

293
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:10,614
Some boring-ass white people
who can't dance--

294
00:19:10,682 --> 00:19:12,343
Oh, will you stop.

295
00:19:12,417 --> 00:19:14,408
Sometimes you catch a white guy
in my neighborhood...

296
00:19:14,486 --> 00:19:16,420
but that's only when
they're buying from me.

297
00:19:16,488 --> 00:19:19,753
But when I come down to their ritzy
neighborhoods, they get uncomfortable.

298
00:19:20,626 --> 00:19:22,958
- I s this it?.
- Yep.

299
00:19:24,796 --> 00:19:27,526
- Come on, baby.
- Ah, come over here.

300
00:19:27,599 --> 00:19:29,430
- Let's not go.
- Come on.

301
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:32,436
- I'll take you to the Copa.
- I don't want to go to the Copa.

302
00:19:32,504 --> 00:19:35,029
- This'll be boring.
- Well, Trish is my friend.

303
00:19:35,107 --> 00:19:37,098
I want you to meet her.

304
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:40,942
Come on, you have to take a hit.
That way, you'll change your mind.

305
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:42,947
- Baby.
- What?.

306
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:44,778
If it's awful, we'll leave.

307
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:46,477
- Promise?.
- I promise.

308
00:19:46,552 --> 00:19:49,214
- Five minutes.
- Five minutes is not enough.

309
00:19:50,255 --> 00:19:52,189
Exactly. That's my point.

310
00:19:52,257 --> 00:19:53,781
All right.

311
00:19:56,295 --> 00:19:58,593
- Can I help you?.
- Yeah.

312
00:19:58,664 --> 00:20:00,791
We're looking for a Jack Wimmer.

313
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:02,458
That would be the penthouse.

314
00:20:02,534 --> 00:20:05,196
Here.
You can finish it, man.

315
00:20:19,851 --> 00:20:23,343
So, doyou guys know
this new artist Brian Ferrill?.

316
00:20:23,422 --> 00:20:25,390
I bought these two paintings
forJack.

317
00:20:26,458 --> 00:20:27,652
Aren't they pretty?.

318
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:30,821
This is disgusting.

319
00:20:35,033 --> 00:20:36,762
You've got company.

320
00:20:38,203 --> 00:20:41,297
- Get me a beer and get her a Cosmo--
- Cosmopolitan?.

321
00:20:41,373 --> 00:20:44,638
- Yes.
- No, I'll have a diet soda, please.

322
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:46,735
He's cute.
What's his name?.

323
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:49,873
He's not foryou, Cleo.

324
00:20:49,948 --> 00:20:52,781
- You always gotta have your way, huh?.
- That's right.

325
00:20:56,888 --> 00:20:58,583
I'm so glad you made it!

326
00:21:20,812 --> 00:21:22,746
That's quite a view, huh?.

327
00:21:22,814 --> 00:21:23,872
Unbelievable.

328
00:21:27,152 --> 00:21:29,643
- No, that one.
- Oh, yeah. That one too.

329
00:21:30,322 --> 00:21:32,756
That's nothing, man.
I got that shit at home.

330
00:21:32,824 --> 00:21:36,089
- Oh, yeah?. Where you from?.
- I'm uptown.

331
00:21:36,161 --> 00:21:37,719
Oh, yeah?. Where about?.

332
00:21:38,730 --> 00:21:40,891
South Bronx.

333
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:43,025
Oh, really?. That's cool.

334
00:21:43,702 --> 00:21:45,693
By the way, I'm Jack Wimmer.

335
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:50,302
- "Ahh," what?.
- Soyou're the lucky motherfucker.

336
00:21:50,375 --> 00:21:53,242
- Oh. Yeah.
- This your place, huh?.

337
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:55,610
It's embarrassing.
I'm not used to it.

338
00:21:55,681 --> 00:21:57,046
So what doyou do?.

339
00:21:57,115 --> 00:21:59,140
I'm a investment banker.

340
00:21:59,217 --> 00:22:01,845
That's what this is--
a business party for me.

341
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:04,013
I represent half those people
down there.

342
00:22:04,089 --> 00:22:08,025
I wanna represent the other half,
so I let them impress each other.

343
00:22:08,093 --> 00:22:09,993
Right.
Do the work foryou.

344
00:22:10,829 --> 00:22:12,820
What doyou do?.

345
00:22:12,898 --> 00:22:16,390
Obviously, whatever I do I'm not doing
enough of, that's for sure. You know?.

346
00:22:16,468 --> 00:22:17,765
Yeah.

347
00:22:17,836 --> 00:22:20,464
But basically
I'm just self-employed.

348
00:22:21,139 --> 00:22:22,629
That's cool.

349
00:22:24,076 --> 00:22:27,443
I bet that whatever it is
thatyou do...

350
00:22:27,512 --> 00:22:30,879
is not half as bad as what
some ofthose people down there do.

351
00:22:30,949 --> 00:22:32,814
That's an interesting point ofview.

352
00:22:32,884 --> 00:22:35,682
Anyone who would judge you
for whaty ou do is a hypocrite...

353
00:22:35,754 --> 00:22:39,212
because... any real businessman...

354
00:22:39,291 --> 00:22:41,987
anyone who makes any real money
is gonna be cutthroat.

355
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:44,790
Any media company, oil company,
tobacco company--

356
00:22:44,863 --> 00:22:47,457
those are some ofthe most vicious
people in the world.

357
00:22:48,133 --> 00:22:52,661
They've got stock holders worldwide
who are basically accessories in crime.

358
00:22:52,738 --> 00:22:55,434
Still, at the end ofthe day, man...

359
00:22:55,507 --> 00:22:57,702
you go to sleep
feeling legit, right?.

360
00:22:58,977 --> 00:23:01,810
Me, man,
I go to sleep every night, like...

361
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,575
one eye like that.

362
00:23:03,648 --> 00:23:05,582
Yeah.

363
00:23:05,650 --> 00:23:10,087
Butyou could be a part ofthis too.
It's the age of peace and prosperity.

364
00:23:10,155 --> 00:23:11,417
- Yeah.
- Seriously.

365
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:14,323
- Put me down for some that.
- How do I get in touch with you?.

366
00:23:14,393 --> 00:23:16,657
- Go through your girl.
- Through Trish?.

367
00:23:16,728 --> 00:23:18,787
Yeah.
Trish knows my girl Carmen.

368
00:23:18,864 --> 00:23:20,627
- Oh, your girlfriend's Carmen?.
- Yeah.

369
00:23:20,699 --> 00:23:23,964
Oh, I've heard a lot about her.
That's cool.

370
00:23:24,035 --> 00:23:26,970
So, basically, we both have
girlfriends who are--

371
00:23:27,038 --> 00:23:28,403
Yeah, well, you know--

372
00:23:28,473 --> 00:23:31,465
- You can look at the menu, right?.
- We're human, right?.

373
00:23:40,419 --> 00:23:42,580
So, did you have fun?.

374
00:23:42,654 --> 00:23:44,588
Oh, yeah, yeah.

375
00:23:44,656 --> 00:23:48,057
That's only because
I thought it was gonna suck.

376
00:23:48,126 --> 00:23:51,357
- ThatJack's a "herb," man.
- You think?.

377
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:52,920
Totally.
Here, have some.

378
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:56,891
You're not drinking tonight.
What's up?.

379
00:23:57,669 --> 00:23:58,897
I can't.

380
00:23:59,571 --> 00:24:01,061
What doyou mean?.

381
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:04,208
I mean I can't.

382
00:24:05,544 --> 00:24:07,239
Not while I'm pregnant.

383
00:24:10,449 --> 00:24:11,711
You're kidding.

384
00:24:11,783 --> 00:24:13,444
You're just saying that.

385
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:17,380
No, come on.
Are you serious?.

386
00:24:21,793 --> 00:24:23,590
When?. When?. I mean--

387
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:26,525
Are you serious?.

388
00:24:26,598 --> 00:24:29,726
Why didn'tyou tell me?.
When did this happen?. When did you know?.

389
00:24:30,735 --> 00:24:32,930
- Does it matter?.
- Oh, my God.

390
00:24:33,004 --> 00:24:36,496
I can't believe you're pregnant.
Holy shit!

391
00:24:36,575 --> 00:24:38,770
I can't believe that.

392
00:24:38,844 --> 00:24:41,142
Come over here.
Give me a kiss.

393
00:24:43,482 --> 00:24:46,417
Hey, hey, let me get you.

394
00:24:46,485 --> 00:24:48,646
- Okay, okay.
- Careful, careful.

395
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,017
Come on.

396
00:24:50,088 --> 00:24:52,079
You're gaining weight already.

397
00:24:56,361 --> 00:24:58,295
I'm havin' a baby!

398
00:24:58,363 --> 00:25:01,298
- No, we're having a baby.
- That's what I said.

399
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:05,827
I can't believe it.
I'm gonna go park the car.

400
00:26:05,697 --> 00:26:07,324
It's okay.

401
00:26:13,438 --> 00:26:16,202
Hey, how you doing?.

402
00:26:16,274 --> 00:26:17,866
I missed you.

403
00:26:17,943 --> 00:26:18,967
My arm.

404
00:26:19,044 --> 00:26:21,035
I know, baby, I know.

405
00:26:24,449 --> 00:26:25,939
How's the baby?.

406
00:26:26,017 --> 00:26:27,575
- The baby?.
- Yeah.

407
00:26:28,587 --> 00:26:30,555
The baby's fine.

408
00:26:31,222 --> 00:26:33,782
- How you doing?.
- My arm.

409
00:26:33,858 --> 00:26:36,486
I know, baby, I know.

410
00:26:36,561 --> 00:26:38,051
They didn't get me.

411
00:26:41,733 --> 00:26:43,223
Where's--

412
00:26:44,369 --> 00:26:46,394
I got it right here.

413
00:26:48,373 --> 00:26:49,863
It's right here, baby.

414
00:26:51,242 --> 00:26:52,766
Got it right here.

415
00:26:54,879 --> 00:26:59,213
They got my beatin'-off arm.
My dick don't like my left hand.

416
00:26:59,284 --> 00:27:01,650
You're lucky.
That shit just missed your heart.

417
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:05,053
- What side you think his heart is on?.
- Who gives a fuck what side?.

418
00:27:05,123 --> 00:27:07,057
We got important shit to discuss.

419
00:27:07,125 --> 00:27:09,889
Jimmy, you know
who the shooter was?.

420
00:27:09,961 --> 00:27:12,327
That piece of shit
we almost nailed the other day.

421
00:27:12,397 --> 00:27:13,955
-Jose.
- Yeah.

422
00:27:14,032 --> 00:27:17,297
-I don't like them motherfuckers anyway.
-That's what I'm sayin'.

423
00:27:17,369 --> 00:27:21,567
That's Tito's boy. Tito's gonna pay.
We hit that motherfucker tonight.

424
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:25,041
Nah,Jimmy, we can't do that, man.
We just got beef with them.

425
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:28,045
Ifthe cops see us,
they'll come for us, man.

426
00:27:28,113 --> 00:27:31,048
I don't give a fuck who knows.
It's been two days.

427
00:27:31,116 --> 00:27:34,608
We don't hit him tonight, them niggas
gonna start pushin' in on our spots.

428
00:27:34,686 --> 00:27:37,484
You don't think I know it's been
two days?. I wanna get out ofhere.

429
00:27:37,555 --> 00:27:38,852
Just wait for me.

430
00:27:38,923 --> 00:27:40,413
Shit, man.

431
00:27:40,492 --> 00:27:42,858
- Yeah, baby.
- Fuck 'em, man!

432
00:27:42,927 --> 00:27:46,795
What's goin' on, man?.
You wanna talk to me now, man?.

433
00:27:46,865 --> 00:27:50,130
You got something to say?.
Who's running this crew?.

434
00:27:54,205 --> 00:27:58,301
- Make sure he don't do anything stupid.
- Whateveryou say, papa.

435
00:27:59,511 --> 00:28:01,001
What ever you say.

436
00:28:02,013 --> 00:28:03,640
You right, Vic.

437
00:28:03,715 --> 00:28:05,205
I'm gonna wait.

438
00:28:06,651 --> 00:28:08,710
Call me later, all right?.

439
00:28:19,130 --> 00:28:21,428
Fucking cops know who shot me.

440
00:28:21,499 --> 00:28:24,127
Nothing like this stays quiet
in the neighborhood.

441
00:28:24,202 --> 00:28:26,727
They're just gonna wait and see
ifI go after Tito.

442
00:28:26,805 --> 00:28:30,901
They get Tito out of the way, then they
take me down-- two birds and all that.

443
00:28:30,975 --> 00:28:35,309
They're happy to stand on the sidelines
and let us take each other out.

444
00:28:37,882 --> 00:28:39,873
I mean, Carmen must be freaking out.

445
00:28:39,951 --> 00:28:41,976
Yeah, yeah.
It's totally fucked up.

446
00:28:42,053 --> 00:28:45,648
But it's just a bullet in the shoulder.
I think he's gonna be fine.

447
00:28:46,491 --> 00:28:51,451
You should think about this. You haven't
worked with someone like Vic before.

448
00:28:51,529 --> 00:28:55,397
Do you have any idea how much
he's worth liquid,just cash?.

449
00:28:56,768 --> 00:28:58,702
Four or five million dollars.

450
00:28:59,838 --> 00:29:01,829
- Really?.
- Really.

451
00:29:02,507 --> 00:29:04,202
Oh, shit.

452
00:29:04,275 --> 00:29:05,742
He's a businessman, Trish.

453
00:29:05,810 --> 00:29:09,940
Ifhe were born in the suburbs,
he'd be running a Fortune 500 company.

454
00:29:10,014 --> 00:29:12,448
He's born in the Bronx,
he does what he does.

455
00:29:14,919 --> 00:29:17,649
I like him. He's as legit
as anyone else I've everworked with.

456
00:29:17,722 --> 00:29:19,417
No, I like him too.

457
00:29:19,491 --> 00:29:22,858
- He's cute and intelligent.
- You think he's cute?.

458
00:29:22,927 --> 00:29:24,360
Yeah. Areyou jealous?.

459
00:29:24,429 --> 00:29:27,694
- No. He's got a bullet in his shoulder.
- You're so mean.

460
00:29:27,766 --> 00:29:31,258
- Cleo, howyou doing?.
- What's going on?.

461
00:29:31,336 --> 00:29:33,270
- You guys taking off?.
- Yeah. Bye.

462
00:29:33,338 --> 00:29:35,636
Have fun. Don't spend
too much of my money.

463
00:29:35,707 --> 00:29:37,140
I'll spend every dime.

464
00:29:37,809 --> 00:29:39,743
- Here.
- What's this?.

465
00:29:39,811 --> 00:29:44,180
Trish's boyfriend took a liking to you
and he wants to do business with you.

466
00:29:45,416 --> 00:29:47,350
When did he call?.
This morning?.

467
00:29:47,418 --> 00:29:49,409
Last week.
But that's not the point.

468
00:29:49,487 --> 00:29:53,651
- Why?. You don't think I can handle it?.
- No! That's not what I'm saying.

469
00:29:53,725 --> 00:29:55,886
I wouldn't be where I am today
ifI couldn't.

470
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:58,656
I think you can handle anything.
I've always said that.

471
00:29:58,730 --> 00:30:02,029
But it's a different animal, papi.

472
00:30:04,636 --> 00:30:05,898
All right.

473
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:09,462
I mean, we're talking
about a Wall Street guy.

474
00:30:10,475 --> 00:30:15,003
Ifyou're gonna do this, go in knowing
that he's not smarter than you.

475
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:17,611
You hear me?.

476
00:30:18,349 --> 00:30:19,816
Rafrael Menendez...

477
00:30:19,884 --> 00:30:23,251
younger brother of Joanna Menendez,
La Colombiana.

478
00:30:23,321 --> 00:30:27,348
I've seen her maybe three or four times
in the ten years I've worked for her.

479
00:30:27,425 --> 00:30:29,359
She don't like people
to know who she is...

480
00:30:29,427 --> 00:30:31,657
so she sends Rafael
to do all her business.

481
00:30:31,729 --> 00:30:34,061
He's someone you definitely
don't wanna fuck with.

482
00:30:34,132 --> 00:30:38,501
So basical ly, bottom I i ne, what
I 'm aski ng you is for approval. Okay?.

483
00:30:38,570 --> 00:30:40,504
'Cause Tito's gonna go to war, man...

484
00:30:40,572 --> 00:30:44,565
and if I don't respond hard,
this shit's gonna be mad out of control.

485
00:30:44,642 --> 00:30:47,076
You know what I'm sayin', right?.

486
00:30:47,145 --> 00:30:48,635
Tito's a stupid motherfucker.

487
00:30:48,713 --> 00:30:50,237
I know that.

488
00:30:50,315 --> 00:30:53,307
He's been a pain in our asses
for a long time.

489
00:30:54,419 --> 00:30:56,614
Just make sure
this is overwith quick.

490
00:30:56,688 --> 00:31:00,215
Yeah, man, no doubt. I'm about
winning, I'm not about fighting.

491
00:31:01,292 --> 00:31:05,285
Of course, surely this has nothing to do
with you wanting a piece ofhis action.

492
00:31:05,363 --> 00:31:08,025
We're gonna give you Tito's spots
down to Prospect.

493
00:31:08,099 --> 00:31:11,728
Hector and Negro
will split up what's left over.

494
00:31:11,803 --> 00:31:12,963
All right.

495
00:31:13,705 --> 00:31:15,036
Listen.

496
00:31:16,674 --> 00:31:19,609
She told me she appreciates
you coming to us about this.

497
00:31:19,677 --> 00:31:21,611
I only do business
with you people, man.

498
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:23,442
She's always appreciated
a good businessman.

499
00:31:23,514 --> 00:31:24,845
Yeah. Same.

500
00:31:26,985 --> 00:31:30,853
Look, I got a little token of
appreciation foryour sister.

501
00:31:32,023 --> 00:31:33,183
No doubt.

502
00:31:39,530 --> 00:31:42,226
She really appreciates everything,
you know.

503
00:31:43,234 --> 00:31:45,862
What areyou so impressed for?.
He ain't nobody.

504
00:31:45,937 --> 00:31:48,906
'Cause ifit wasn't for them,
we wouldn't be where we're at right now.

505
00:31:48,973 --> 00:31:51,168
Man, stop sweatin' it.
You want his balls.

506
00:31:51,242 --> 00:31:53,472
No, you sweat the small stuff.

507
00:31:53,544 --> 00:31:56,104
You don't see the big picture.
That's your problem.

508
00:31:56,180 --> 00:32:01,117
My brother would say, " Keep your homies
close and keep your beef even closer"

509
00:32:01,185 --> 00:32:03,016
Bro, that's Godfather.

510
00:32:03,087 --> 00:32:05,021
From The Godfather?.

511
00:32:05,089 --> 00:32:08,149
That's not from The Godfrather.
That's my brother's fuckin' words.

512
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:11,658
I'm just telling you
that was from The Godfrather.

513
00:32:52,170 --> 00:32:53,432
It's Crackhead Pete.

514
00:32:53,504 --> 00:32:56,496
Let that nigga in, man.
You know that nigga's cool.

515
00:35:15,246 --> 00:35:19,706
- That's how you do it!
- What tookyou so fuckin' long, man?.

516
00:35:19,784 --> 00:35:21,445
Where were you, motherfucker?.

517
00:35:23,154 --> 00:35:24,416
That's right.

518
00:35:24,489 --> 00:35:25,854
Whereyour late pass at?.

519
00:35:26,524 --> 00:35:28,924
You my boys.
I know you can handle all that shit.

520
00:35:28,993 --> 00:35:31,484
They gonna bury that fat motherfucker
in the ocean--

521
00:36:00,925 --> 00:36:02,290
BMF.COM

522
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:06,558
No more jets to the Caymans.
I'm talking instant transfer of cash.

523
00:36:06,631 --> 00:36:09,896
Hoc's right. It's a sleeping giant.
Every single bankwants--

524
00:36:09,967 --> 00:36:12,026
I don't know what it's like
to lose a son...

525
00:36:12,103 --> 00:36:13,593
There are no more sleeping giants.

526
00:36:13,671 --> 00:36:16,731
but after what Jimmy did to Tito's kid,
I knew I was out.

527
00:36:18,476 --> 00:36:21,468
Maybe investing with Jack
was gonna be the answer.

528
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:25,915
- So you're saying I 'm wrong, Sasha?.
- Do you know him?.

529
00:36:27,185 --> 00:36:29,483
- Hey, how's it going?.
- What's up, dawg?.

530
00:36:29,554 --> 00:36:32,045
- It's good to see you.
- Good to see you, man.

531
00:36:33,658 --> 00:36:35,751
I'll catch you guys
on the way out.

532
00:36:35,826 --> 00:36:37,817
- Bye.
- I'll see you later.

533
00:36:41,399 --> 00:36:43,731
That's a cute little booty.
Yeah.

534
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:47,903
- You got a drink?.
- Yeah, I'm good, man.

535
00:36:47,972 --> 00:36:49,166
You want a cigar?.

536
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:50,764
Oh, hell, yeah, man.

537
00:36:52,009 --> 00:36:54,170
So, you ready to do
some business?.

538
00:36:54,245 --> 00:36:55,837
I was born ready, baby.

539
00:36:55,913 --> 00:36:57,403
This is a prospectus.

540
00:36:57,481 --> 00:37:00,279
It's gonna look like,
I don't know, hieroglyphics toyou...

541
00:37:00,351 --> 00:37:02,251
but I'll explain it later.

542
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:04,948
What's this "prospecticus" for?.

543
00:37:05,823 --> 00:37:08,917
It's for a start-up company.
We call it a sleeping giant.

544
00:37:08,993 --> 00:37:11,359
There aren't any more
sleeping giants left, you know.

545
00:37:11,429 --> 00:37:13,624
They're most ofthem extinct.

546
00:37:14,298 --> 00:37:15,424
What doyou mean?.

547
00:37:21,339 --> 00:37:23,307
- What?.
- I was trying to playyou, man.

548
00:37:23,374 --> 00:37:25,865
I just overheard you.
I came early.

549
00:37:25,943 --> 00:37:27,877
Oh, no, no.

550
00:37:27,945 --> 00:37:31,403
They didn't believe me anyway.
There are some good ones out there.

551
00:37:31,482 --> 00:37:32,949
What type of deals?.

552
00:37:33,017 --> 00:37:34,951
Biotechnology.
Human genome.

553
00:37:35,019 --> 00:37:36,646
This is legit?.

554
00:37:36,721 --> 00:37:39,986
What doyou mean, is it legit?.
Of course it's legit.

555
00:37:40,992 --> 00:37:42,118
Is it legit?.

556
00:37:42,193 --> 00:37:44,058
- For real?.
- For real.

557
00:37:44,829 --> 00:37:47,992
The question you gotta ask your self is,
how much are you willing to invest?.

558
00:37:50,167 --> 00:37:51,498
All right.

559
00:37:51,569 --> 00:37:55,938
So, how much do I need to invest
in this cloning stuff?.

560
00:37:56,007 --> 00:37:59,636
Ifyou just wanna get your feet wet,
we're talking a minimum of $1 million.

561
00:37:59,710 --> 00:38:01,575
It's a six to eight month
investment period.

562
00:38:01,646 --> 00:38:04,843
We're looking to make back several times
our initial investment within the year.

563
00:38:04,915 --> 00:38:08,681
There's no such thing as a sure thing,
but this is as close as it gets.

564
00:38:08,753 --> 00:38:11,586
Jack and I did our homework
on each other.

565
00:38:11,656 --> 00:38:14,648
He's got what he's got,
and I want what he's got.

566
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:17,821
I keep my money in nine places.

567
00:38:17,895 --> 00:38:21,228
An apartment that belongs to some old
woman that can't afford to live there...

568
00:38:21,299 --> 00:38:25,565
bodegas, a blind man's place,
a principal's office, all over.

569
00:38:25,636 --> 00:38:28,571
I pay their rent,
give them some grocery cash...

570
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:30,971
and in return
they keep a safe for me.

571
00:38:34,045 --> 00:38:36,206
Yo, wake up.
Vic's here.

572
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:44,512
You want a brew, man?.

573
00:38:44,588 --> 00:38:46,215
Yeah. Kick it over here.

574
00:38:46,290 --> 00:38:47,917
So what's up, man?.

575
00:38:55,633 --> 00:38:57,624
I got this investment opportunity...

576
00:38:58,936 --> 00:39:01,803
and I could make enough money
to get out ofthis shit.

577
00:39:01,872 --> 00:39:04,204
If you're interested,
I can bring you in.

578
00:39:04,275 --> 00:39:06,869
Maybe make enough to get out.
What doyou think?.

579
00:39:07,611 --> 00:39:10,944
Get out ofwhat, man?.
I'm happy doing what I'm doing.

580
00:39:11,015 --> 00:39:12,949
I thoughtyou was happy too.

581
00:39:13,017 --> 00:39:16,453
You think I wanna go out
like my brother?.

582
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:18,579
Besides, I got a baby coming.

583
00:39:23,961 --> 00:39:25,292
Congratulations, papa.

584
00:39:27,865 --> 00:39:29,298
What about the crew?.

585
00:39:29,367 --> 00:39:32,700
Well, you've been running this shit
with me since the very beginning anyhow.

586
00:39:33,637 --> 00:39:36,606
All it is now is,
I'm out ofthe way.

587
00:39:36,674 --> 00:39:39,973
You know La Colombiana
ain't just letyou walk away like that.

588
00:39:45,516 --> 00:39:49,577
Man, with the money you're making
right now, she could easy forget me.

589
00:39:49,653 --> 00:39:52,315
I could just fade away easy
like that.

590
00:39:53,324 --> 00:39:57,488
All I need from you
is help with the head start.

591
00:39:57,561 --> 00:39:59,324
Come here, man.

592
00:39:59,397 --> 00:40:01,456
- You got it.
- Thanks, man.

593
00:40:07,838 --> 00:40:09,806
Freeze! Police! Hands up!

594
00:40:09,874 --> 00:40:11,603
- Put 'em up!
- Keep your hands off me.

595
00:40:11,675 --> 00:40:13,404
- Shut up!
- Get down!

596
00:40:13,477 --> 00:40:15,968
Don't fuck around this time!

597
00:40:16,046 --> 00:40:19,641
- Shut the fuck up, Vic.
- Don't worry. We'll take care ofyou.

598
00:40:19,717 --> 00:40:21,651
You are fucking done.

599
00:40:21,719 --> 00:40:23,653
- You're sorry, all right.
- My arm! My arm!

600
00:40:23,721 --> 00:40:24,983
So am I. Let's go.

601
00:40:25,055 --> 00:40:26,989
- Could I just get myjacket, please?.
- No, smart ass, you can't.

602
00:40:27,057 --> 00:40:28,991
What about my cell phone?.

603
00:40:29,794 --> 00:40:32,729
You ever get picked up for anything,
there's one thing you never forget--

604
00:40:32,797 --> 00:40:35,925
keepyour mouth shut,
don't say a fuckin' word.

605
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:39,595
You think cops are stupid? You think
you can talkyour way out? You're wrong.

606
00:40:39,670 --> 00:40:43,663
Almost every conviction they get
is some dumb motherfucker...

607
00:40:43,741 --> 00:40:45,174
tripping him self up.

608
00:40:45,242 --> 00:40:46,504
Keep your mouth shut.

609
00:40:46,577 --> 00:40:49,910
Close off your mind.
Try to relax. Don't listen.

610
00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:53,472
Evertyhing they say is a lie.

611
00:40:53,551 --> 00:40:56,850
They'll tell you they got witnesses,
that your boys turned on you.

612
00:40:56,921 --> 00:40:58,252
All lies.

613
00:40:58,322 --> 00:41:01,655
If they had that, they wouldn 't be
bothering with all this shit.

614
00:41:01,725 --> 00:41:03,784
Man, I called everybody.

615
00:41:03,861 --> 00:41:06,421
I had no one else to turn to but Jack.

616
00:41:06,497 --> 00:41:10,433
His sent this lawyer, an old white cat
named Bobby Gold, to get me...

617
00:41:10,501 --> 00:41:12,435
and like that, I'm out.

618
00:41:12,503 --> 00:41:16,735
Let's get the hel I out of here.
Let's go. Get hi m out of there.

619
00:41:27,751 --> 00:41:29,742
I t's cold as shit, man.

620
00:41:30,754 --> 00:41:33,348
- Thank you for coming.
- Everything is under control.

621
00:41:33,424 --> 00:41:35,415
- It's all gonna be all right?.
- Yes.

622
00:41:36,694 --> 00:41:38,628
You shouldn't have
any more trouble.

623
00:41:38,696 --> 00:41:41,221
This is a bullshit case.
They know it.

624
00:41:41,298 --> 00:41:46,429
Anybody asks you anything about this,
any cops come nearyou...

625
00:41:46,504 --> 00:41:49,905
you call me immediately, all right?.

626
00:41:49,974 --> 00:41:52,465
- I gotta run.
- Okay. Thanks so much.

627
00:41:56,347 --> 00:41:59,282
You know I took a big chance working
with you in the first place, right?.

628
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:01,215
- I know, man.
- This can't happen.

629
00:42:01,285 --> 00:42:03,981
- I took a chance on you too, you know.
- I know.

630
00:42:04,054 --> 00:42:06,682
But if it happens again,
the deal's off. All right?.

631
00:42:06,757 --> 00:42:08,486
All right. Yeah.

632
00:42:08,559 --> 00:42:11,027
The girls are waiting for us.
You wanna go out?.

633
00:42:11,095 --> 00:42:13,086
- All right, whatever.
- Come on.

634
00:42:19,803 --> 00:42:21,703
Westartedout

635
00:42:21,772 --> 00:42:23,603
As friends

636
00:42:23,674 --> 00:42:27,132
And then the fun began

637
00:42:27,211 --> 00:42:30,339
This place is so amazing.
You guys are gonna love it.

638
00:42:30,414 --> 00:42:33,645
And you know what?.
A lot of " boriquas" come here.

639
00:42:33,717 --> 00:42:35,344
- A lot ofwhat?.
- " Boriquas"

640
00:42:35,419 --> 00:42:38,980
Boriquas, Vic.
Leave her alone. You know what she said.

641
00:42:39,056 --> 00:42:42,184
Look, there's Mike. Remember Mike?.
He was here last time.

642
00:42:42,259 --> 00:42:44,853
- Yes, you do.
- She's hard-core, man.

643
00:42:44,929 --> 00:42:48,956
The one who loves andleaves me

644
00:42:49,033 --> 00:42:51,024
So why can't you drink?.

645
00:42:54,004 --> 00:42:55,995
My baby's having a baby.

646
00:42:57,541 --> 00:42:58,633
Really?.

647
00:42:58,709 --> 00:43:01,974
- Hell, yeah. I know where to put it.
- That's really great.

648
00:43:02,046 --> 00:43:04,173
Congratulations.
What did I miss?.

649
00:43:04,248 --> 00:43:05,943
They're having a baby.

650
00:43:06,016 --> 00:43:07,108
What?.

651
00:43:07,184 --> 00:43:09,345
Yeah. Isn't that great?.

652
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:12,355
- Oh, my God. You're having a baby?.
- Isn't that beautiful?.

653
00:43:12,423 --> 00:43:15,358
- They're having a baby.
- I heard it the first time.

654
00:43:15,426 --> 00:43:18,224
- And Jack knew before me?.
- What is that drink?.

655
00:43:18,295 --> 00:43:21,458
- It's Bacardi and wine. Taste it.
- That's so beautiful.

656
00:43:21,532 --> 00:43:23,864
- Thankyou.
- Can you feel ityet?.

657
00:43:24,835 --> 00:43:27,827
You told me
that you'd always love me

658
00:43:27,905 --> 00:43:30,635
So is it gonna be pretty small
with the baby in there?.

659
00:43:30,708 --> 00:43:31,834
Well...

660
00:43:31,909 --> 00:43:35,208
- You'll have to get a bigger place.
- Yeah, we're trying, but--

661
00:43:35,279 --> 00:43:37,713
Babe, what about the loft?.

662
00:43:37,781 --> 00:43:39,248
What about the loft?.

663
00:43:39,316 --> 00:43:42,046
Well, nobody's living in it,
and it's huge.

664
00:43:42,119 --> 00:43:43,552
That's true, you know.

665
00:43:43,621 --> 00:43:47,387
We have this loft in Soho that I got
as an investment a coupleyears ago.

666
00:43:47,458 --> 00:43:50,427
-You got a place in Soho?.
-It's beautiful, and no one lives there.

667
00:43:50,494 --> 00:43:53,759
-It's empty.
-Ifyou want, you could live there free.

668
00:43:53,831 --> 00:43:56,322
You should totally live there.
We could decorate.

669
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:59,892
- Hear them out.
- You could totally live there.

670
00:44:02,139 --> 00:44:05,438
This here is
Lifestyles ofthe Rich and Famous.

671
00:44:05,509 --> 00:44:09,411
This is it. Why bother making money
if you ain't livin' like this?

672
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:12,313
You should all live like this
just once.

673
00:44:14,251 --> 00:44:16,412
This don't make no sense to me.

674
00:44:16,487 --> 00:44:19,285
- What, you got some pussy down there?.
- Come on, Chedda.

675
00:44:19,356 --> 00:44:21,290
I'm trying to concentrate here.

676
00:44:21,358 --> 00:44:23,292
You ain't got no concentration.
That's the problem.

677
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:25,692
Ain't nobody talkin' toyou.
I'm over here with this.

678
00:44:26,997 --> 00:44:30,023
You'll be back. Everything you are
is in this neighborhood.

679
00:44:30,100 --> 00:44:32,398
- What's wrong with you motherfuckers?.
- That's right, man.

680
00:44:32,469 --> 00:44:36,906
Motherfuckers should be happy.
He's doing something with his life.

681
00:44:37,941 --> 00:44:40,375
You outyour mind, man.
We came up knee-high with this.

682
00:44:40,444 --> 00:44:44,175
This is family. You see this?.
All this is family, understand?.

683
00:44:44,248 --> 00:44:46,273
- We still family.
- I loveyou motherfuckers.

684
00:44:46,950 --> 00:44:48,110
He'll be back.

685
00:44:48,185 --> 00:44:50,585
No, I'm not coming back.
This is it.

686
00:44:50,654 --> 00:44:52,952
I gotta move on.
I made my decision.

687
00:44:53,023 --> 00:44:56,550
Jimmy's gonna take over the spots.
You're lucky to have a leader like this.

688
00:44:56,627 --> 00:44:59,221
- Motherfucker.
- You ain't never coming back?.

689
00:44:59,296 --> 00:45:01,161
No, dawg, I'm coming back.

690
00:45:01,231 --> 00:45:03,392
I'm coming back
'cause I gotta smoke with my ho's.

691
00:45:03,467 --> 00:45:05,799
A motherfucker's gotta smoke
with his ho's.

692
00:45:06,704 --> 00:45:08,763
It's only 20 minutes away.

693
00:45:11,408 --> 00:45:14,639
We'll come and see you every weekend.
I promise.

694
00:45:14,712 --> 00:45:17,647
But not every weekend.

695
00:45:17,715 --> 00:45:19,910
I have my life.
You know that.

696
00:45:20,918 --> 00:45:22,647
Mom.

697
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:24,381
I'm just kidding.

698
00:45:29,493 --> 00:45:31,984
- What areyou gonna get here?.
- I don't know.

699
00:45:32,062 --> 00:45:33,529
This thing withJack--

700
00:45:33,597 --> 00:45:37,363
I know I'm letting go of the bird in
the hand for the one that's flying...

701
00:45:38,535 --> 00:45:40,696
and I hope I'm right.

702
00:45:40,771 --> 00:45:43,262
- Looks like doo-doo.
- Oh, no. This is the one.

703
00:45:53,684 --> 00:45:55,811
Should it be more this way?.

704
00:46:16,006 --> 00:46:18,133
This is the way we should be living.

705
00:46:18,208 --> 00:46:20,142
My woman deserves it...

706
00:46:20,210 --> 00:46:22,041
my kid deserves it...

707
00:46:22,112 --> 00:46:23,739
and I deserve it.

708
00:46:23,814 --> 00:46:25,543
Fuck evertyhing else.

709
00:46:49,072 --> 00:46:52,564
-Looks Iike I'm going to court and shit.
-Nah, it looks good.

710
00:46:52,643 --> 00:46:54,474
Jack. What can I say?

711
00:46:54,545 --> 00:46:56,536
We're getting to know
each other better.

712
00:46:57,481 --> 00:47:00,143
I think he's a white me
in a lot of ways.

713
00:47:00,217 --> 00:47:03,880
Theysay that good-looking people
look good even in garbage bags.

714
00:47:03,954 --> 00:47:06,889
Yeah, but I'll take Armani,
just like Jack.

715
00:47:06,957 --> 00:47:09,016
I got the suit and the sweater.

716
00:47:09,092 --> 00:47:12,061
- Let me take care of my shit.
- I t's not even my money.

717
00:47:12,129 --> 00:47:14,120
I t's a corporate card.
Seriously, it's fine.

718
00:47:17,701 --> 00:47:19,692
- How are you?.
- I'm okay.

719
00:47:20,804 --> 00:47:23,136
- It's good to see you.
- Look at you!

720
00:47:24,308 --> 00:47:26,970
- So, how are you?.
- I'm good.

721
00:47:27,044 --> 00:47:29,308
I miss the old neighborhood though.

722
00:47:30,948 --> 00:47:32,381
You know, my moms.

723
00:47:33,450 --> 00:47:36,248
Vic really likes it.
He seems relaxed.

724
00:47:36,920 --> 00:47:39,184
- How's the pregnancy going?.
- Good.

725
00:47:40,324 --> 00:47:41,814
Look atyou.

726
00:47:44,094 --> 00:47:48,224
Bad morning sickness every now and then,
but other than that it's all good.

727
00:47:48,298 --> 00:47:50,732
I mean, is Vic taking care ofyou
and all that?.

728
00:47:50,801 --> 00:47:53,065
Yeah. You know, regular stuff.

729
00:47:53,136 --> 00:47:56,071
He doesn't let me do anything.

730
00:47:56,139 --> 00:47:59,336
- I can't even cook anymore.
- That's great. I hate to cook.

731
00:47:59,409 --> 00:48:03,743
Yeah, well, I can't even get him to eat
Spanish food anymore. How about that?.

732
00:48:05,582 --> 00:48:07,413
Yo, Vic!
It's fuckin' Vic!

733
00:48:07,484 --> 00:48:10,715
- What's the deal, yo?.
- You better have your ghetto pass.

734
00:48:10,787 --> 00:48:14,223
You see?. That's the pretty
motherfucker right there.

735
00:48:14,291 --> 00:48:16,225
Loud-ass Puerto Ricans, man.

736
00:48:16,293 --> 00:48:17,783
What's the deal, yo?.

737
00:48:19,296 --> 00:48:21,423
- Son, what's up, huh?.
- What's up?.

738
00:48:21,498 --> 00:48:23,830
Lookin' sharp, spiffy.

739
00:48:25,402 --> 00:48:27,666
- How are you?.
- Good.

740
00:48:27,738 --> 00:48:30,730
- Mama!
- It's been like a fucking year!

741
00:48:32,109 --> 00:48:34,509
High-class jibaro.

742
00:48:34,578 --> 00:48:37,376
- What's up, man?.
- What's up?. How's your dick hangin'?.

743
00:48:37,447 --> 00:48:40,644
Yo, listen, yo, how you doin'?.
Whereyou been?.

744
00:48:40,717 --> 00:48:44,448
Just workin', man, doin' my shit.
This and that, yada, yada, you know.

745
00:48:44,521 --> 00:48:45,954
It's her mother's birthday.

746
00:48:46,023 --> 00:48:48,958
Gonna go see her mom.
You know how her mom is. Let's go.

747
00:48:49,026 --> 00:48:50,755
It's all right.

748
00:48:50,827 --> 00:48:53,762
Aw, come on, man.
We ain't seen you in forever.

749
00:48:53,830 --> 00:48:56,765
- Give me a holler. You got my number.
- Vic, we gotta go.

750
00:48:56,833 --> 00:48:59,028
Where we gotta go?.
We ain't got nothin' to do.

751
00:48:59,102 --> 00:49:00,967
- Yo, what's up?.
- Holler at me, man.

752
00:49:01,038 --> 00:49:03,370
- I'm gonna holler.
- I gotta take her.

753
00:49:04,374 --> 00:49:06,399
Yo, Vic, that's a nice suit
you got there.

754
00:49:06,476 --> 00:49:10,003
- Thanks, dawg.
- Let's get the fuck out ofhere.

755
00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:11,570
All right, Vic.

756
00:49:12,582 --> 00:49:14,072
All right, dawg.

757
00:50:13,577 --> 00:50:15,568
Honey, carve this for me.

758
00:50:17,014 --> 00:50:19,505
Titi, look at the chain
that Vic bought me.

759
00:50:20,517 --> 00:50:23,247
- They're diamonds.
- Oh, my God!

760
00:50:24,454 --> 00:50:25,648
Crazy, right?.

761
00:50:25,722 --> 00:50:28,816
Oye, check this.
Check this. Right here.

762
00:50:28,892 --> 00:50:32,760
-Jesus Christ, that's huge!
- Hey, hey. Watch your tongue.

763
00:50:32,829 --> 00:50:36,424
Pero that's thicker
than Vic's chain.

764
00:50:36,500 --> 00:50:39,128
Baby, show them
your G chain.

765
00:50:39,202 --> 00:50:42,194
Come on, papi.

766
00:50:42,272 --> 00:50:44,536
Oye, papo. Come on, bro.
Show me. What's up?.

767
00:50:45,742 --> 00:50:47,073
I'm not wearin' it.

768
00:50:47,144 --> 00:50:49,237
What do you mean,
you're not wearing it?.

769
00:50:49,312 --> 00:50:52,008
I mean I'm not wearing it.
I don't got it on.

770
00:50:53,350 --> 00:50:55,341
- Butyou always--
- I don't got it on, okay?.

771
00:50:55,419 --> 00:50:58,081
I don't got it on.
What doyou want me to say?.

772
00:51:06,897 --> 00:51:08,728
IfI never come back
to this neighborhood...

773
00:51:08,799 --> 00:51:10,426
I'm gonna fuckin' die happy.

774
00:51:11,768 --> 00:51:13,599
Whatever that means.

775
00:51:15,238 --> 00:51:18,935
I just got nothing to say to anybody
around here anymore, you know?.

776
00:51:20,043 --> 00:51:22,238
What the hell is wrong with you?.

777
00:51:22,312 --> 00:51:25,975
You turn your back on the only people
who give a fuck about you.

778
00:51:26,049 --> 00:51:28,176
You thinkJack
gives a shit aboutyou?.

779
00:51:28,251 --> 00:51:31,152
You think because we hang out with
Jack and Trish every now and then...

780
00:51:31,221 --> 00:51:32,483
they're our friends?.

781
00:51:33,490 --> 00:51:36,687
We ain't got no friends, Victor.

782
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:40,696
All we have is some "bourgie"
loft apartmentyou call home.

783
00:51:41,498 --> 00:51:43,329
Well, where I'm at,
that's your home.

784
00:51:44,167 --> 00:51:47,603
- It'll never be home to me.
- So that's the way it is, huh?.

785
00:51:48,905 --> 00:51:51,703
- Why don't you go the fuck back?.
- Maybe I should.

786
00:51:51,775 --> 00:51:56,041
Oh, man. You know--
You know everything I do foryou?.

787
00:51:56,113 --> 00:52:00,573
I turn myself inside out. I fuckin'
bend myself over backwards foryou.

788
00:52:00,650 --> 00:52:03,881
Well, fuck that. You know?.
Just go back to your fuckin' moms.

789
00:52:09,593 --> 00:52:10,924
What?. What's that look now?.

790
00:52:10,994 --> 00:52:13,588
That look is
I don't know who the fuckyou are.

791
00:52:13,663 --> 00:52:16,928
You know who the fuck I am?. The one
who tells you get the fuck outta my car.

792
00:52:19,903 --> 00:52:21,234
Get out!

793
00:52:21,304 --> 00:52:24,205
Don't give me that fuckin' look.
Get the fuck outta my car!

794
00:52:24,274 --> 00:52:25,866
Open the fuckin' door!

795
00:52:25,942 --> 00:52:28,035
There. How's that, dumb bitch?.

796
00:52:30,213 --> 00:52:33,239
Yeah. Don't fuckin' break my door.

797
00:52:39,956 --> 00:52:42,254
Jack. What's up, dawg?
Howyou doin', man?

798
00:52:43,260 --> 00:52:44,784
I'm all right.

799
00:52:46,229 --> 00:52:48,959
Man, me and Carmen
just had a big-ass fight.

800
00:52:49,032 --> 00:52:52,866
I told her to go home and just go
to her fuckin' mom's forever.

801
00:52:54,371 --> 00:52:57,272
I don't care, man. I don't care.
Fuck that, you know?.

802
00:52:57,340 --> 00:53:00,173
Sometimes you gotta talk to them
like that, you know what I'm saying?.

803
00:53:00,243 --> 00:53:01,710
Yeah.

804
00:53:01,778 --> 00:53:05,578
You know, I don't wanna go home, man.
You got anything goin' on?.

805
00:53:06,816 --> 00:53:08,784
That's cool. I'll come by.

806
00:53:22,999 --> 00:53:25,661
I wanted to wait till the girls
were around to give this toyou...

807
00:53:26,870 --> 00:53:28,497
but I kinda gotta
give it toyou now.

808
00:53:30,340 --> 00:53:31,671
Check it out.

809
00:53:36,346 --> 00:53:38,143
Sweet, man.

810
00:53:38,215 --> 00:53:39,944
Okay. I'll call you back.

811
00:53:40,016 --> 00:53:42,780
- Thanks.
- $2 million.

812
00:53:42,852 --> 00:53:46,015
- I doyou wrong?.
- Hell, no, man.

813
00:53:49,726 --> 00:53:53,127
- Dude-- I can't even talk.
- You're speechless.

814
00:53:53,196 --> 00:53:57,030
It's not always going to be like this.
The market's really hot right now, so--

815
00:53:57,100 --> 00:53:58,431
So let's put it back in, man.

816
00:53:58,501 --> 00:54:02,267
- Well, I'll think about it.
- All right.

817
00:54:03,673 --> 00:54:05,334
What's bothering you?.
What's going on?.

818
00:54:07,844 --> 00:54:11,439
Women, man. They askyou
to change, right?.

819
00:54:11,514 --> 00:54:14,608
And when you change,
you become someone else, they hateyou.

820
00:54:14,684 --> 00:54:16,777
'Cause they wanted
the guy that they first met.

821
00:54:16,853 --> 00:54:19,515
Butyou can't be that anymore,
'cause they've asked you to change.

822
00:54:20,223 --> 00:54:24,057
Okay. I know where to take you.
Come on. It'll be all right.

823
00:54:25,996 --> 00:54:27,327
Cheers.

824
00:54:30,433 --> 00:54:32,333
So what's our next move, man?.

825
00:54:32,402 --> 00:54:36,031
I wanna sit you down with my partners.
I wanna introduce you to them.

826
00:54:36,106 --> 00:54:37,539
- Yeah?.
- Yeah.

827
00:54:37,607 --> 00:54:41,168
And I think the next thing we need to do
after that is to evaluate--

828
00:54:43,480 --> 00:54:45,141
evaluate your risk tolerance.

829
00:54:45,215 --> 00:54:47,410
- Diversify--
- I got a serious appetite for risk.

830
00:54:47,484 --> 00:54:50,976
I know you do, but we need to
have some safe things foryou also.

831
00:54:51,054 --> 00:54:52,544
-Just for the future.
- Okay.

832
00:54:52,622 --> 00:54:55,250
We should schedule that meeting
for a couple of weeks from now.

833
00:54:55,325 --> 00:54:58,021
Right now I'm working on another thing
that's taking a lot oftime.

834
00:54:58,094 --> 00:55:01,359
Yeah, what is it?.
Ifyou can talk about it--

835
00:55:01,431 --> 00:55:04,696
Sure. What we had you in before
was a $60 million fund.

836
00:55:04,768 --> 00:55:07,601
This is a $600 million fund.

837
00:55:07,671 --> 00:55:09,434
Can we get him another girl?.

838
00:55:09,506 --> 00:55:12,703
- 600 million. Wow, man.
- $600 million.

839
00:55:12,776 --> 00:55:14,505
It's so much money, man.

840
00:55:14,577 --> 00:55:18,411
It's similar to the deal
I was doing with you, but...

841
00:55:19,416 --> 00:55:21,384
it's a $4.5 million minimum.

842
00:55:21,451 --> 00:55:24,818
I'm in for six.
This thing is unbelievable.

843
00:55:24,888 --> 00:55:29,120
Wait a minute. You're putting 6 million
ofyour own cash into this?.

844
00:55:29,192 --> 00:55:33,959
This has a really solid management team.
20 years experience, never fucked up.

845
00:55:34,864 --> 00:55:38,095
Some really smart money in it.
A really sound idea.

846
00:55:38,168 --> 00:55:40,636
Everyone's clamoring to get in,
but the deal's closed.

847
00:55:42,405 --> 00:55:44,396
There's no way
you can massage me into that?.

848
00:55:45,742 --> 00:55:47,073
Areyou seriously interested?.

849
00:55:49,245 --> 00:55:50,576
What?.

850
00:55:50,647 --> 00:55:54,048
To show you how heavy my
commitment is, I'll give it back toyou.

851
00:55:54,117 --> 00:55:55,880
-Just put it right in.
- You listen to me.

852
00:55:55,952 --> 00:55:58,045
- Then I can get in on it.
- Listen. You keep this.

853
00:55:58,121 --> 00:56:00,487
This is clean money.
They didn't do this for nothing, okay?.

854
00:56:00,557 --> 00:56:01,888
You keep a hold ofthat.

855
00:56:01,958 --> 00:56:05,621
Ifyou are interested, you get some
more money together and you call me.

856
00:56:05,695 --> 00:56:09,062
- How much time do you have?.
- I'd say about a week or something.

857
00:56:09,132 --> 00:56:11,566
A week. Oh, man.

858
00:56:11,634 --> 00:56:14,068
It's a lot of pressure.
I really want you to think about it.

859
00:56:14,137 --> 00:56:16,970
It scares me the way you just
jump into things like this. Okay?.

860
00:56:17,674 --> 00:56:19,005
Uh-huh.

861
00:56:20,210 --> 00:56:21,541
All right.

862
00:56:25,382 --> 00:56:27,509
It's my turn.

863
00:56:37,026 --> 00:56:39,358
Once you start workin'
for Joanna Menendez,you're hers.

864
00:56:39,429 --> 00:56:40,919
There's no such thing as quitting.

865
00:56:40,997 --> 00:56:44,091
No matter whatyou do,
she's gonna take a cut for life.

866
00:56:44,167 --> 00:56:47,728
So there ain't a hell of a lot
I could do. I could pack up and run.

867
00:56:47,804 --> 00:56:49,897
I could pay her 40 percent
of what I bring in.

868
00:56:49,973 --> 00:56:54,376
I could tell her to go fuck off, though
I wouldn 't make it back to the car.

869
00:56:54,444 --> 00:56:57,538
Or I could talk to her
like a business man.

870
00:56:57,614 --> 00:56:58,945
Let me tell you what I did.

871
00:56:59,015 --> 00:57:01,677
I thought about what Donald Trump
or Ted Turner would have done.

872
00:57:01,751 --> 00:57:03,082
They would have made a deal.

873
00:57:03,153 --> 00:57:06,645
Talk the language
all businessmen understand-- money.

874
00:57:19,769 --> 00:57:21,634
Oh, my God. Look at you.

875
00:57:21,704 --> 00:57:24,002
You look so amazing
for your age. Look at you.

876
00:57:24,073 --> 00:57:27,600
- If I was only ten years older--
- Are you learning how to flirt?.

877
00:57:27,677 --> 00:57:29,975
Just now?.

878
00:57:30,046 --> 00:57:31,980
I met you
when you were so green.

879
00:57:37,086 --> 00:57:41,079
But everything comes with a price,
even that gorgeous smile ofyours.

880
00:57:41,157 --> 00:57:42,488
What do you want?.

881
00:57:43,493 --> 00:57:48,521
We been working together how long now?.
Ten years?. Something like that?.

882
00:57:48,598 --> 00:57:51,658
I madeyou $5, 6 million a year?.
Maybe a little bit more?.

883
00:57:53,970 --> 00:57:55,835
And all that time I never fucked you.

884
00:57:55,905 --> 00:57:59,864
I never held out on you.
I was always the bestyou had.

885
00:57:59,943 --> 00:58:03,970
But like every business diversifies,
I need to diversify...

886
00:58:04,047 --> 00:58:06,345
'cause there's only so far
I can go in this lifestyle.

887
00:58:06,416 --> 00:58:10,853
"Lifestyle." What's so bad about it?.
What doyou need, Vic?.

888
00:58:10,920 --> 00:58:13,753
I don't seeyou walking around
with a Metro card in your pocket.

889
00:58:13,823 --> 00:58:17,919
Stop it. Stop it.
Talk to me, Victor.

890
00:58:17,994 --> 00:58:20,462
I got Jimmy working
my crew right now.

891
00:58:20,530 --> 00:58:22,691
He's making as much money
as I was making before...

892
00:58:22,765 --> 00:58:26,257
soyou're not gonna
be hurting with me gone.

893
00:58:26,336 --> 00:58:30,363
'Cause I got a prospect foryou.
I wanna merge with you.

894
00:58:30,440 --> 00:58:35,742
I wanna make a partnership where I can
getyou 300% return on your investment.

895
00:58:35,812 --> 00:58:39,942
- How much areyou looking for?.
- 1.5.

896
00:58:41,818 --> 00:58:43,149
That's a lot of money.

897
00:58:43,219 --> 00:58:47,656
I know, but I can getyou 4.5
in a six-month period.

898
00:58:47,724 --> 00:58:49,521
That's the beauty ofit.

899
00:58:49,592 --> 00:58:51,924
I'm talking about
as soon as I getyour money back...

900
00:58:52,929 --> 00:58:57,059
I wanna be able to diversify some more.
You know what I'm saying?.

901
00:58:59,035 --> 00:59:02,004
- What kind ofa deal is it?.
- Offshore deposits.

902
00:59:02,071 --> 00:59:05,507
- Money laundering.
- No, this guy's legitimate.

903
00:59:06,676 --> 00:59:08,166
How solid is your contact?.

904
00:59:08,244 --> 00:59:10,906
This guy's unbelievable. I met him
through my girlfriend.

905
00:59:10,980 --> 00:59:13,107
It's this white guy.
The hottest guy on Wall Street.

906
00:59:13,182 --> 00:59:16,777
Everybody's investing with this cat.
He's got all the money he needs.

907
00:59:18,621 --> 00:59:21,590
There's no such thing, baby.
We both know that.

908
00:59:21,658 --> 00:59:23,285
Right. True, true.

909
00:59:25,395 --> 00:59:26,987
Butyou know, you're right.

910
00:59:27,997 --> 00:59:31,956
You earned this one.
But I want 500% return.

911
00:59:32,035 --> 00:59:36,301
$7.5 million.
That's my price.

912
00:59:37,106 --> 00:59:38,437
I don't know ifI can do that.

913
00:59:42,445 --> 00:59:45,278
All right, you got it. I just need
the money by the end ofthe week.

914
00:59:45,348 --> 00:59:46,975
All right.

915
00:59:48,184 --> 00:59:52,177
Butyou want something from me,
I want something from you--Jimmy.

916
00:59:53,890 --> 00:59:56,188
He's in a warwith Hector.
I can't have that.

917
00:59:57,226 --> 00:59:59,023
Hector is a good guy.

918
00:59:59,095 --> 01:00:02,360
He's not crazy like Tito,
cutting the shit and all that.

919
01:00:02,432 --> 01:00:05,458
But this has to come to an end...

920
01:00:05,535 --> 01:00:08,732
before it turns violent
and they fuck up my business.

921
01:00:09,772 --> 01:00:12,866
- You talk to Jimmy.
- All right.

922
01:00:12,942 --> 01:00:16,878
Yeah. You know, it's just that...

923
01:00:16,946 --> 01:00:19,813
me and Jimmy, we just--
I haven't talked to him in a while.

924
01:00:19,882 --> 01:00:23,318
Butyou're like brothers.
He'll listen toyou.

925
01:00:25,388 --> 01:00:27,413
Okay. I'll talk to him.

926
01:00:27,490 --> 01:00:30,084
Will you talk to him tonight?.

927
01:00:32,395 --> 01:00:33,726
Tonight.

928
01:00:34,631 --> 01:00:38,499
Then you'll come back here on Friday
to getyour money.

929
01:00:40,069 --> 01:00:42,060
- La Colombiana?
- Yeah, come on.

930
01:00:42,138 --> 01:00:44,163
What doyou got to do
with La Colombiana?

931
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:47,437
Colombiana asked me just
to intervene on her behalf...

932
01:00:47,510 --> 01:00:49,637
and just stop before
it turns into something.

933
01:00:49,712 --> 01:00:52,909
This is the same motherfucker
that came to me talkin' about...

934
01:00:52,982 --> 01:00:57,248
"I'm gonna have a kid," "I want out
the game," "I wanna do what's right."

935
01:00:57,320 --> 01:01:01,416
You come back now, you telling me
how to run my business.

936
01:01:01,491 --> 01:01:03,118
You are telling me how to run it.

937
01:01:03,192 --> 01:01:07,788
You fucking turn this into violence,
you're gonna getyourselffucked.

938
01:01:10,033 --> 01:01:12,866
Who's gonna fuck me?.
That fuckin' bitch?.

939
01:01:12,935 --> 01:01:14,368
What areyou gonna do?.

940
01:01:15,772 --> 01:01:18,263
I'm gonna go over there tonight
and settle this whole shit.

941
01:01:19,509 --> 01:01:21,943
Ifyou're gonna do that,
I'm going with you, man.

942
01:01:22,011 --> 01:01:25,378
I'm gonna gowith you and settle it.
Gimmeyour gun. I'll take care ofthis.

943
01:01:25,448 --> 01:01:26,972
Ain't noway
I'm giving you my gun.

944
01:01:27,050 --> 01:01:30,213
Come on. I'll gowith you and cure this.
Just give me the gun.

945
01:01:30,286 --> 01:01:33,517
That's like giving you myfucking shoes.
I ain't giving you my gun, V.

946
01:01:33,589 --> 01:01:36,080
Give meyour gun.
Give meyour gun, man.

947
01:01:39,262 --> 01:01:41,924
I gotyour back. You know I'll never
let shit happen toyou.

948
01:01:51,307 --> 01:01:52,831
What's up, Hector?.
Howyou doin', dawg?.

949
01:01:52,909 --> 01:01:54,809
- What's up, Vic?.
- Brought you some offerings.

950
01:01:55,812 --> 01:01:57,143
Thanks, brother.

951
01:01:58,314 --> 01:02:01,579
Lost some weight.
You're looking Diesel and shit.

952
01:02:02,585 --> 01:02:05,076
- Stress, you know?.
- Yeah, I hear that.

953
01:02:05,154 --> 01:02:08,214
I heard about your abuelita, man.
She hurt her hip and what not.

954
01:02:08,291 --> 01:02:10,555
She's good, man.
How's your lady?.

955
01:02:10,626 --> 01:02:13,117
Love of my life.
Shit's so ill.

956
01:02:14,130 --> 01:02:15,927
You know how she is.
Overambitious and shit.

957
01:02:15,998 --> 01:02:18,432
Hardly ever see her.
That's why I works, you know?.

958
01:02:23,506 --> 01:02:26,805
Let's cut to the chase, Vic.
You know what I'm about, right?.

959
01:02:26,876 --> 01:02:28,741
Right, man. I know.

960
01:02:28,811 --> 01:02:31,302
Your boy here,
you need to keep him on a short leash.

961
01:02:32,982 --> 01:02:36,509
Kinda strong, man. Kinda strong words
and whatnot, you know?.

962
01:02:36,586 --> 01:02:40,818
But I got to talk to Rafael,
and we just want to squash the beef.

963
01:02:40,890 --> 01:02:42,881
Optimize the situation, you know?.

964
01:02:42,959 --> 01:02:45,393
I spoke to Rafael too, man.

965
01:02:46,829 --> 01:02:48,160
Jimmy's got a long tongue.

966
01:02:48,231 --> 01:02:51,462
Talks too much shit around the
neighborhood, like he's running shit.

967
01:02:51,534 --> 01:02:54,469
We were like that once.
We were coming up.

968
01:02:54,537 --> 01:02:56,664
You used to say a lot ofshit--
hotheaded and whatnot.

969
01:02:56,739 --> 01:03:00,470
We all make mistakes. Right,Jimmy?.
You ain't gonna do that no more.

970
01:03:01,511 --> 01:03:03,172
So what's up,Jimmy?.
We cool orwhat?.

971
01:03:04,781 --> 01:03:08,717
You know what, Hec?.
We cool, man.

972
01:03:22,431 --> 01:03:24,262
What wereyou thinking?.

973
01:03:24,333 --> 01:03:27,496
You fucking promised me
you wouldn't do anything!

974
01:03:29,906 --> 01:03:33,239
You're fucking overreacting!
Calm the fuck down!

975
01:03:33,309 --> 01:03:35,174
Fuckyou, motherfucker!
Fuckyou!

976
01:03:35,244 --> 01:03:37,678
I'm not overreacting,
you fucking idiot!

977
01:03:37,747 --> 01:03:41,615
I gaveyou the crew to run, not to
fucking take them on a suicide mission.

978
01:03:41,684 --> 01:03:45,120
Fucking kill yourself, but don't take
Jay and Chedda with you, you asshole!

979
01:03:45,188 --> 01:03:48,521
You fuckin' trying to tell me
how to run my fuckin' business?.

980
01:03:48,591 --> 01:03:51,151
It's beyond that, man.
I gaveyou your fuckin' business.

981
01:03:51,227 --> 01:03:53,787
You were nothing before
I came into this shit!

982
01:03:53,863 --> 01:03:56,957
What the fuck do you know?.
You ain't been around for months!

983
01:03:57,033 --> 01:03:59,024
Come skippin' back
into the fuckin' neighborhood.

984
01:03:59,101 --> 01:04:01,035
It's supposed to be the same.
Butyou know what?.

985
01:04:01,103 --> 01:04:03,765
This fuckin' shit is different.
This whole fuckin' thing is ours.

986
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:06,707
Jimmy, you're not listening.
You're not listening, man.

987
01:04:06,776 --> 01:04:10,212
La Colombiana doesn't fuckin' play.
She's gonna come afteryour ass.

988
01:04:10,279 --> 01:04:12,770
La Colombiana.
I'll give her my fucking balls.

989
01:04:12,849 --> 01:04:14,544
Chedda,Jay, listen to me.

990
01:04:14,617 --> 01:04:16,812
Listen to me. I'm telling you.
It's over for the man.

991
01:04:16,886 --> 01:04:18,820
They're gonna kill him.
Doyou understand?.

992
01:04:18,888 --> 01:04:20,549
Ain't nobody touching
nothing over here.

993
01:04:20,623 --> 01:04:22,318
Look. Let me tell you,Jimmy.

994
01:04:22,391 --> 01:04:26,452
I'm not gonna give you a diaper buddy,
knee-high little speech over here.

995
01:04:26,529 --> 01:04:28,224
We all we got. Understand?.

01:04:28,297 --> 01:04:30,857
We been doing this shit.

997
01:04:30,933 --> 01:04:33,299
There's nothing gonna bring 'em back.
They got toe tags.

998
01:04:33,369 --> 01:04:35,098
They outta here. It's done.

999
01:04:35,171 --> 01:04:36,695
What needs to be known right now...

1000
01:04:36,772 --> 01:04:39,741
are you on this side over here,
or are you with them motherfuckers?.

1001
01:04:40,776 --> 01:04:43,040
- It's not that simple.
- It is that fuckin' simple.

1002
01:04:43,112 --> 01:04:44,602
Remembe rwhen you fixed my VCR?.

1003
01:04:44,680 --> 01:04:48,343
You fixed it, I fucked it up.

1004
01:04:48,417 --> 01:04:51,853
No matter how bad it got,
you fixed it, I fucked it up.

1005
01:04:51,921 --> 01:04:53,616
You fixed it, I fucked it up.

1006
01:04:55,324 --> 01:04:56,655
Fix this.

1007
01:05:02,665 --> 01:05:04,462
You think you fucked me, right?.

1008
01:05:04,533 --> 01:05:06,194
You just to like to prove some shit...

1009
01:05:06,269 --> 01:05:08,794
that maybe you can't be told
what to do?.

1010
01:05:08,871 --> 01:05:10,361
But you fucked yourself worse.

1011
01:05:11,240 --> 01:05:13,800
- Yeah. You know what I think?.
- What doyou think?.

1012
01:05:13,876 --> 01:05:15,867
I think that's what you all about.

1013
01:05:15,945 --> 01:05:19,972
I think you don't give a fuck about
Jay, Chedda, me-- nobody.

1014
01:05:20,049 --> 01:05:22,540
You know who you always
give a fuck about?.

1015
01:05:22,618 --> 01:05:26,349
Victor fucking Rosa!
That's who you fucking care about!

1016
01:05:26,422 --> 01:05:28,652
- Right.
- You don't give a fuck about us!

1017
01:05:28,724 --> 01:05:30,453
It's about money with you.
You know why?.

1018
01:05:30,526 --> 01:05:33,620
You go to the white neighborhood all
you want, but you'll always be a spick.

1019
01:05:33,696 --> 01:05:35,994
That's in your fucking blood,
motherfucker.

1020
01:05:36,065 --> 01:05:40,229
Can you guarantee?. Can you guarantee
my blood's gonna stay in my body?.

1021
01:05:40,303 --> 01:05:41,634
Can you ever do that?.

1022
01:05:59,055 --> 01:06:00,886
- How's it going?
- What's up, man?.

1023
01:06:00,957 --> 01:06:02,822
I'm so glad you fucking
called me back, man.

1024
01:06:02,892 --> 01:06:05,360
Yeah, of course.
What's going on?.

1025
01:06:06,062 --> 01:06:08,826
You don't know the half of it, dawg.
I don't know, it's--

1026
01:06:09,598 --> 01:06:13,398
- Oh, man. Things just got so fucked up.
- What's so fucked up?. What's going on?.

1027
01:06:17,239 --> 01:06:19,264
I don't know. I just--

1028
01:06:20,343 --> 01:06:24,040
Don't get me wrong, man,
but I just think--

1029
01:06:24,113 --> 01:06:27,708
I don't know. Maybe I'm a little--
Maybe this deal's too much for me.

1030
01:06:27,783 --> 01:06:31,275
- Maybe it's a little over my head.
- That's ridiculous.

1031
01:06:31,354 --> 01:06:33,413
Everything's going great, okay?.

1032
01:06:33,489 --> 01:06:37,357
- Things are looking really good.
- No, it's just--

1033
01:06:37,426 --> 01:06:39,417
You're gonna have
more than enough money.

1034
01:06:39,495 --> 01:06:41,122
They're really excited
about it out here.

1035
01:06:41,197 --> 01:06:43,131
They're all trashed
and asleep right now.

1036
01:06:43,199 --> 01:06:44,188
It'sjust that--

1037
01:06:46,202 --> 01:06:50,332
Fuck. I haven't seen Carmen in over
a week, man. I haven't talked to her.

1038
01:06:50,406 --> 01:06:52,704
She won't--

1039
01:06:52,775 --> 01:06:56,108
I am in this fucking apartment all by
myself. I'm losing my fucking mind.

1040
01:06:56,178 --> 01:06:57,873
- I'm flipping,you know?
- Listen to me.

1041
01:06:57,947 --> 01:07:01,178
Everything's gonna be fine
with Carmen. All right?.

1042
01:07:01,250 --> 01:07:04,879
Things are going crazy out here.
I'm working on your deal as we speak.

1043
01:07:04,954 --> 01:07:08,412
When she finds out how much money
you've got, she will chill out.

1044
01:07:08,491 --> 01:07:09,822
Everything will be okay.

1045
01:07:09,892 --> 01:07:12,690
Yeah. No doubt
it's gonna be fantastic, man.

1046
01:07:12,762 --> 01:07:15,094
It's gonna be the shit,
you know?.

1047
01:07:15,164 --> 01:07:16,495
Areyou still in Hell-A?.

1048
01:07:16,565 --> 01:07:18,897
Yeah. I'm at this...

1049
01:07:18,968 --> 01:07:21,095
fucking crazy place up in Malibu.

1050
01:07:21,170 --> 01:07:24,071
It's unbelievable. I'm out on the porch,
just soaking it up.

1051
01:07:25,074 --> 01:07:28,009
You know it, man.
We'll have so much money...

1052
01:07:28,077 --> 01:07:30,045
we won't know
what the fuck to do, right?

1053
01:07:30,112 --> 01:07:32,842
- Totally.
- Yeah.

1054
01:07:32,915 --> 01:07:35,645
It's a bet, man. We'll fuckin'
tear this town up, all right?.

1055
01:07:35,718 --> 01:07:38,516
Man, we're gonna party
our fuckin' brains out.

1056
01:07:38,587 --> 01:07:41,249
- But call me for sure, man.
- Forsure.

1057
01:07:41,323 --> 01:07:42,790
All right. Later.

1058
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:52,524
Hey, Trish?. Listen--

1059
01:07:52,601 --> 01:07:55,627
Honey, can I just
askyou a little thing?.

1060
01:07:56,639 --> 01:08:00,905
It is better to sit here,
be miserable, than to be with him?.

1061
01:08:00,976 --> 01:08:05,106
You know, honey, the asshole is in
his apartment as miserable as you are.

1062
01:08:05,181 --> 01:08:09,515
Ifhe's so fucking miserable
he can call me and apologize.

1063
01:08:09,585 --> 01:08:13,988
Okay. This is it.
Honey.

1064
01:08:14,056 --> 01:08:17,116
Ifyou decide to have this baby
with that asshole...

1065
01:08:17,193 --> 01:08:18,626
go and have
the babywith him.

1066
01:08:18,694 --> 01:08:23,290
I'm behind you a hundred percent.
I'm your mother. Remember?.

1067
01:08:23,365 --> 01:08:26,334
Ifyou want to have this baby
byyourself, I'm here foryou.

1068
01:08:26,402 --> 01:08:28,063
Let's do that.

1069
01:08:28,137 --> 01:08:32,904
The only thing I cannot do is watch you
watching television.

1070
01:08:32,975 --> 01:08:35,239
Watching novelas
and doing nothing!

1071
01:08:45,721 --> 01:08:47,052
Hello?.

1072
01:08:48,557 --> 01:08:51,492
- Trish, what the hell you doing here?.
- God.

1073
01:08:53,796 --> 01:08:55,491
I have missed you.

1074
01:08:55,564 --> 01:08:57,532
Yeah. It's okay.

1075
01:08:57,600 --> 01:09:00,125
Place looks cute. Looks good.

1076
01:09:00,202 --> 01:09:02,796
- Yeah. How'd you get in?.
- I have my own set.

1077
01:09:02,872 --> 01:09:04,635
Doyou have some wine
or something?.

1078
01:09:06,542 --> 01:09:08,169
- I'll see what I got.
- Thankyou.

1079
01:09:10,312 --> 01:09:12,143
Vic, I was
in the neighborhood shopping...

1080
01:09:12,214 --> 01:09:15,206
and I thought I'd come by
and see how you are.

1081
01:09:18,287 --> 01:09:20,755
- This is all I got.
- Thankyou.

1082
01:09:22,558 --> 01:09:25,618
- I'm gonna go upstairs and change.
- No, you're not.

1083
01:09:25,694 --> 01:09:27,889
- I'm not?.
- No.

1084
01:09:27,963 --> 01:09:30,295
You're not being a very good host,
leaving me here.

1085
01:09:30,366 --> 01:09:34,359
Yeah. I'm being a good host byjust
going upstairs. I'm gonna change.

1086
01:09:34,436 --> 01:09:37,530
I don't give a fuck if you're wearing
a towel, ifthat's why you're worried.

1087
01:09:38,274 --> 01:09:40,401
I just wanna talk toyou.

1088
01:09:40,476 --> 01:09:42,205
But I give a shit
that I'm wearing a towel.

1089
01:09:42,278 --> 01:09:44,803
Since when did you get uptight?.

1090
01:09:45,981 --> 01:09:47,448
Are you uptight now?.

1091
01:09:47,516 --> 01:09:49,040
Come here a second.

1092
01:09:50,052 --> 01:09:51,781
All right.

1093
01:09:51,854 --> 01:09:54,584
So what doyou wanna talk about?.

1094
01:09:54,657 --> 01:09:57,854
I wanna talk aboutyou.
I've never seen these before.

1095
01:09:57,927 --> 01:10:00,623
- Wow.
- Pretty ugly, huh?.

1096
01:10:01,797 --> 01:10:04,857
- I got a little reckless.
- A little reckless?.

1097
01:10:06,235 --> 01:10:09,398
- Yeah, well--
- Do they hurt?.

1098
01:10:10,506 --> 01:10:13,475
- When you poke 'em like that.
- Onlywhen I poke 'em?.

1099
01:10:17,146 --> 01:10:19,706
So, how areyou?.

1100
01:10:22,618 --> 01:10:25,746
I don't wanna talk about it.
Has Jack called you?.

1101
01:10:25,821 --> 01:10:29,484
No, he didn't call.
He's in Miami with his mom.

1102
01:10:29,558 --> 01:10:31,116
What doyou mean,
he's in Miami?.

1103
01:10:32,428 --> 01:10:34,089
I thought he said
hewas in LA.

1104
01:10:36,232 --> 01:10:39,201
You know what?.
I don't wanna talk about Jack.

1105
01:10:46,108 --> 01:10:49,441
- No, come on.
- I just wanna kiss you. Come on.

1106
01:10:49,511 --> 01:10:53,971
- I'm so lonely.Jack's gone, too.
- Come on. You know you're beautiful.

1107
01:10:54,049 --> 01:10:55,983
- Don't do this.
-Just a kiss.

1108
01:10:56,986 --> 01:11:00,046
- Come on. You promised.
- So I broke my promise.

1109
01:11:00,122 --> 01:11:01,680
That makes you a liar,
doesn't it?.

1110
01:11:02,591 --> 01:11:04,058
Aren't we all liars?.

1111
01:11:04,126 --> 01:11:06,458
Oh, God. Don't do this.

1112
01:11:06,528 --> 01:11:08,792
Don't do this. Come on.

1113
01:11:13,369 --> 01:11:14,700
Come on, no.

1114
01:11:15,971 --> 01:11:17,836
- Shit.
- What?.

1115
01:11:17,906 --> 01:11:19,430
Fuckin' turn around.

1116
01:11:20,209 --> 01:11:21,972
Oh, shit!
Carmen, baby.

1117
01:11:22,745 --> 01:11:24,576
I swear to God,
it's not whatyou think it is.

1118
01:11:24,647 --> 01:11:26,308
I just fucking came
out ofthe shower.

1119
01:11:26,382 --> 01:11:28,907
I'm sorry, baby.
It's not what you think it is.

1120
01:11:28,984 --> 01:11:33,216
- I was taking a shower. She came in--
- Carmen,just--

1121
01:11:33,289 --> 01:11:36,747
God! Was that necessary?.

1122
01:11:36,825 --> 01:11:38,315
Just get the fuck out ofhere.

1123
01:11:38,394 --> 01:11:41,158
Baby, I'm sorry. You gotta listen to me.
Just hear me out, please.

1124
01:11:41,230 --> 01:11:43,061
Look me in the eye. Come on.

1125
01:11:43,132 --> 01:11:45,464
I know how you feel.

1126
01:11:45,534 --> 01:11:48,731
Ifyou listen to me--Just give me
a moment to explain myself, all right?.

1127
01:11:49,938 --> 01:11:52,600
Come on, baby. I loveyou.
You think I'd do something like this?.

1128
01:11:52,675 --> 01:11:55,803
Carmen, come on.
Baby, come on.

1129
01:12:08,524 --> 01:12:10,958
Morning, Vic.
Nice fuckin' place.

1130
01:12:11,026 --> 01:12:13,551
Security's a little light, though.

1131
01:12:14,563 --> 01:12:16,588
Don'tyou ever fuckin' sleep?.

1132
01:12:16,665 --> 01:12:19,691
Vic, come on.
We had a nice deal going.

1133
01:12:21,870 --> 01:12:23,838
You can't just run out on us.

1134
01:12:26,442 --> 01:12:28,034
Does it look like I'm trying
to run out?.

1135
01:12:28,811 --> 01:12:30,142
She wants to seeyou.

1136
01:12:31,280 --> 01:12:32,611
All right, all right.

1137
01:12:34,216 --> 01:12:35,547
Get dressed.

1138
01:12:48,831 --> 01:12:53,564
I did what I said I was going to do.
There is the money.

1139
01:12:53,635 --> 01:12:58,004
- I'm incredibly grateful for that.
- What happened last night?.

1140
01:12:58,073 --> 01:13:00,405
You were supposed to
make sure there was no violence.

1141
01:13:02,778 --> 01:13:06,009
- You know, I tried--
- "Tried"?.

1142
01:13:06,081 --> 01:13:08,413
What am I supposed to do
with "tried," Vic?.

1143
01:13:08,484 --> 01:13:12,215
You said you could control Jimmy,
and what have I got?.

1144
01:13:12,287 --> 01:13:15,347
One of my key dealers dead
because you "tried"?.

1145
01:13:15,424 --> 01:13:18,325
This is how
you wanna do business with me?.

1146
01:13:18,394 --> 01:13:24,355
I am trusting you
with one and a half million dollars.

1147
01:13:27,870 --> 01:13:29,360
You're gonna fix this.

1148
01:13:34,676 --> 01:13:36,166
Jimmy has to go.

1149
01:13:39,581 --> 01:13:43,677
You got your money.
Nowyou finish your part of the deal.

1150
01:14:07,443 --> 01:14:09,536
This is obviously all ofit.

1151
01:14:09,611 --> 01:14:12,045
Ifyou're short,
you just give me a holler, all right?.

1152
01:14:13,515 --> 01:14:15,244
I'm sure it's all ofit.
Oh, my God.

1153
01:14:15,317 --> 01:14:17,478
I didn't know you were
going to bring it all in cash.

1154
01:14:17,553 --> 01:14:19,043
It's a cash business.

1155
01:14:20,689 --> 01:14:24,489
Right. God, I gotta get this
to the bank. This is crazy.

1156
01:14:27,262 --> 01:14:30,925
- This better work.
- It's a lock, a total lock. I just--

1157
01:14:30,999 --> 01:14:33,297
We gotta go out and party
tonight or something, right?.

1158
01:14:33,368 --> 01:14:37,236
- No. I gotta take care of something.
- What do you gotta take care of?.

1159
01:14:37,306 --> 01:14:38,933
Look, I did my part.

1160
01:14:39,007 --> 01:14:41,237
- Now you do your part, all right?.
- Sure thing.

1161
01:14:55,090 --> 01:14:57,854
All right.
I'll meetyou there. Peace.

1162
01:15:26,555 --> 01:15:27,886
Don't come any fucking closer.

1163
01:15:32,794 --> 01:15:35,558
Take your fucking hands outyour pocket.
Let me seeyour hands.

1164
01:15:37,165 --> 01:15:38,928
Hereyou go.
I just wanna talk toyou.

1165
01:15:41,370 --> 01:15:43,361
I just wanna talk toyou.
That's all.

1166
01:15:44,206 --> 01:15:45,673
So talk.

1167
01:15:48,677 --> 01:15:52,374
You know, on my way over here
I was thinking about that time--

1168
01:15:52,447 --> 01:15:55,712
Remember that time when we were
about in eighth grade...

1169
01:15:55,784 --> 01:15:57,809
and we were at that bodega
near Saint Anne's...

1170
01:15:58,620 --> 01:16:00,645
and we were gonna rob
that carton of cigarettes?.

1171
01:16:00,722 --> 01:16:03,623
You were supposed to pretend to be
in a seizure, and we go in there...

1172
01:16:04,626 --> 01:16:07,060
and the guy starts--

1173
01:16:07,129 --> 01:16:09,689
You throw yourself on the ground,
flippin' and foamin'...

1174
01:16:09,765 --> 01:16:11,096
and the guy starts laughing.

1175
01:16:11,166 --> 01:16:13,691
You start flipping out a little more,
going a little crazier.

1176
01:16:13,769 --> 01:16:15,737
The guy laughs more.
You jump up, you grab him.

1177
01:16:15,804 --> 01:16:17,135
You say "Yo, motherfucker.

1178
01:16:18,140 --> 01:16:19,505
Ifthis shit was for real...

1179
01:16:19,575 --> 01:16:22,066
would you be laughing your ass off
like that, motherfucker??"

1180
01:16:22,144 --> 01:16:26,046
You went crazy. You started goddamn
tearing the place apart, man.

1181
01:16:29,651 --> 01:16:32,984
Right then and there, I knew you could
do anything you ever wanted, man.

1182
01:16:34,122 --> 01:16:35,521
'Causeyou were afraid
of nothin'.

1183
01:16:36,358 --> 01:16:38,121
That shit always stuck with me.

1184
01:16:40,329 --> 01:16:41,728
And then they sent you
to kill me?.

1185
01:16:45,267 --> 01:16:48,828
- Yeah.
- You gonna do it?.

1186
01:16:51,340 --> 01:16:52,671
What doyou think?.

1187
01:16:53,842 --> 01:16:55,503
I thinkyou thought about it.

1188
01:17:01,950 --> 01:17:04,748
Just... run, man.

1189
01:17:04,820 --> 01:17:07,846
Just fuckin' run
the fuck outta here.Just--

1190
01:17:07,923 --> 01:17:09,720
Keep goin', man.
Don't fuckin' turn around.

1191
01:17:12,494 --> 01:17:13,984
Where am I gonna go?.

1192
01:17:18,567 --> 01:17:20,091
I don't know, man.

1193
01:17:23,238 --> 01:17:25,103
I don't wanna die, man.

1194
01:20:13,575 --> 01:20:16,203
The number you have reached
is not in service.

1195
01:20:16,278 --> 01:20:18,303
Please check the number
and dial again.

1196
01:20:33,695 --> 01:20:36,823
The cellular number you have called
is no longer in service.

1197
01:20:36,898 --> 01:20:39,059
There is no further information.

1198
01:20:52,147 --> 01:20:54,138

1199
01:20:54,216 --> 01:20:57,242
Yeah, hel lo.

1201
01:21:00,822 --> 01:21:03,347

1202
01:21:03,425 --> 01:21:06,952
I don't have
a "Bobby Gold" listed here.

1203
01:21:07,028 --> 01:21:09,155
I'll connect you to Personnel.

1204
01:21:11,733 --> 01:21:14,133
Personnel. How can I help you?

1205
01:21:16,037 --> 01:21:18,403
- Hello?
- Yeah.

1206
01:21:20,108 --> 01:21:21,439
Hello?

1207
01:21:21,509 --> 01:21:27,448
I 'm looking for a... Bobby Gold--
a Robert Gold, attorney-at-law.

1208
01:21:27,515 --> 01:21:33,044
Bobby Gold. To my recollection,
there's nobody here named Bobby Gold.

1209
01:21:33,121 --> 01:21:34,850
Not working at this office.

1210
01:21:36,057 --> 01:21:38,355
Hello? Are you sure
you have the right off--

1211
01:21:47,002 --> 01:21:48,333
Excuse me. Can I hel p you?.

1212
01:21:49,738 --> 01:21:51,069
Yeah.

1213
01:21:52,073 --> 01:21:53,700
I'm looking for Jack Wimmer.

1214
01:21:56,278 --> 01:21:58,712
J ust a moment.

1215
01:21:58,780 --> 01:22:02,409
There's no one in this building
by that name, sir.

1216
01:22:02,484 --> 01:22:05,476
- Excuse me, sir. You can't go in there.
- Yeah.

1217
01:22:35,450 --> 01:22:38,385
Shit! Fucker!

1218
01:22:45,627 --> 01:22:46,958
Bitch!

1219
01:22:52,767 --> 01:22:54,860
Man, I fucked myself.

1220
01:22:54,936 --> 01:22:59,202
I've watched suckers get taken for
50 bucks playing three-card monte...

1221
01:22:59,274 --> 01:23:03,904
and I always thought, "You dumb fucks.
You deserve to be taken.

1222
01:23:03,979 --> 01:23:07,346
Now I've been taken like a child
for more than $4 million.

1223
01:23:07,415 --> 01:23:11,579
Evertyhing I got, plus a million
and a half of La Colom biana's.

1224
01:23:11,653 --> 01:23:15,089
The only thing I had to go on
was the number Jack had called me from.

1225
01:23:15,156 --> 01:23:16,680
It was a Miami number.

1226
01:23:18,193 --> 01:23:21,026
Look, I've been
in crazy situations all my life...

1227
01:23:21,096 --> 01:23:24,896
but this was the first time
that I was all alone.

1228
01:23:24,966 --> 01:23:27,526
I had no where to turn
and no one to help me.

1229
01:23:41,116 --> 01:23:45,450
Fuckin' team ain't here no more, man.
Shit Iike that happens, man.

1230
01:23:45,520 --> 01:23:47,647
Speakin' of the fuckin' devil, man.

1231
01:23:53,328 --> 01:23:55,626
I'm outta here, man.
Come on.

1232
01:23:57,799 --> 01:24:01,963
- Where you going?.
- Bullshit. Bullshit.

1233
01:24:03,171 --> 01:24:04,900
This fucking bullshit.

1234
01:24:42,977 --> 01:24:45,969
Look at this motherfucker
looking all sad and shit.

1235
01:24:50,752 --> 01:24:54,916
Four million?. Shit.
That was pretty fucking stupid, man.

1236
01:24:54,989 --> 01:24:57,583
Come on, man. Would you shut
the fuck up already with this shit?.

1237
01:24:57,659 --> 01:24:58,990
It's bad enough, all right?.

1238
01:24:59,060 --> 01:25:01,824
No doubt,
but it was pretty stupid, man.

1239
01:25:01,896 --> 01:25:04,956
I'm trying to have this motherfucker's
head in the middle ofthe project...

1240
01:25:05,033 --> 01:25:06,830
throwing darts at it. Feel me?.

1241
01:25:06,901 --> 01:25:10,132
- How we gonna get at this motherfucker?.
- I know where he's at. He's in Miami.

1242
01:25:10,205 --> 01:25:12,230
All I got to do is track
his ass down. That's it.

1243
01:25:12,307 --> 01:25:13,706
Let's go get his ass.

1244
01:25:15,210 --> 01:25:17,644
This is mine. I got to go
at this shit alone. All right?.

1245
01:25:19,948 --> 01:25:24,248
Just need your help to get me some cash
to get from here to there. That's all.

1246
01:25:25,687 --> 01:25:29,145
You know, whatever I got, you got.
It's all there, son.

1247
01:25:32,227 --> 01:25:33,717
See what Jimmy's got.

1248
01:25:36,631 --> 01:25:39,600
21. He play better now.

1249
01:25:49,377 --> 01:25:51,106
So, you gonna
let Victor know?.

1250
01:25:52,547 --> 01:25:55,914
- I don't know.
- Well, most people like surprises.

1251
01:25:57,519 --> 01:25:59,885
- It's good to see you.
- Thankyou.

1252
01:26:24,045 --> 01:26:26,377
Baby. Baby, don't.
Please, please.

1253
01:26:27,949 --> 01:26:29,940
Not now. Please don't.
I can't do this right now.

1254
01:26:30,018 --> 01:26:31,349
I know how you feel.

1255
01:26:31,419 --> 01:26:34,411
Come and sit down for a minute.
Can I talk toyou for a minute, please?.

1256
01:26:36,191 --> 01:26:37,886
Yeah?. Come on.

1257
01:26:39,127 --> 01:26:40,458
Areyou all right?.

1258
01:26:43,565 --> 01:26:46,227
God, you're so huge.
Look at that.

1259
01:26:47,969 --> 01:26:49,994
Oh, my God. I can feel it.

1260
01:26:50,071 --> 01:26:52,562
Baby, I'm so sorry. I know
you're mad at me and everything.

1261
01:26:52,640 --> 01:26:54,835
I'm gonna fix everything.
I know howyou feel.

1262
01:26:54,909 --> 01:26:59,005
I just gotta go away for a little while,
all right?. Then I'll come back.

1263
01:27:05,787 --> 01:27:07,118
It's your son.

1264
01:27:10,558 --> 01:27:11,889
It's a boy?.

1265
01:27:13,361 --> 01:27:16,888
No kidding. It's a boy?.
I don't believe that shit.

1266
01:27:18,866 --> 01:27:20,265
Oh, my God.

1267
01:27:24,439 --> 01:27:27,135
Oh, my God.
I can't believe it.

1268
01:27:29,344 --> 01:27:31,539
Oh, baby. That's great.

1269
01:27:31,613 --> 01:27:34,275
I can't believe it. I knew it.
I knew it was gonna be a boy.

1270
01:27:38,219 --> 01:27:41,746
I really fucked up, baby,
but it's gonna be okay.

1271
01:27:41,823 --> 01:27:43,552
I'm gonna fix everything.

1272
01:27:43,625 --> 01:27:47,652
I'm gonna fix it. I'll have Jay coming
for you and take care of you, all right?.

1273
01:27:47,729 --> 01:27:50,197
If you need anything,
you just call me. All right?.

1274
01:27:57,005 --> 01:27:59,405
- I love you, baby.
- I love you too.

1275
01:28:10,485 --> 01:28:12,976
- Hello?
- Hello. Yes, hello.

1276
01:28:13,054 --> 01:28:16,990
I'm a friend ofJack's.
I just got into town.

1277
01:28:17,058 --> 01:28:18,821
I lost his number.
Can you believe that?.

1278
01:28:18,893 --> 01:28:21,521
Luckily, he gave me
your number as a backup.

1279
01:28:21,596 --> 01:28:24,929
Who are you? You're a frriend of my son's
from New York,you said?

1280
01:28:24,999 --> 01:28:28,332
Yeah, we been friends for a long time--
since college and what not.

1281
01:28:28,403 --> 01:28:30,268
He just asked me to come down
for the weekend.

1282
01:28:30,338 --> 01:28:33,364
And he gave you my number?
It's not like him to give out my number.

1283
01:28:33,441 --> 01:28:36,672
Yeah. He didn't know what number
he was gonna have, so--

1284
01:28:36,744 --> 01:28:39,144
He's told me so much about you.

1285
01:28:39,213 --> 01:28:41,545
I hope while I'm down here
I get a chance to meet you.

1286
01:28:41,616 --> 01:28:45,643
That's sweet. Let me get
that number for you, honey.

1287
01:28:45,720 --> 01:28:50,157
You know Jack's staying in South Beach?
He has a new condo. The number is--

1288
01:28:50,224 --> 01:28:52,215
Don't worry.
I don't need the telephone number.

1289
01:28:52,293 --> 01:28:54,124
J ust give me the address.
I'm 20 minutes late.

1290
01:28:54,195 --> 01:28:55,958
I was supposed to meet him
20 minutes ago.

1291
01:28:56,030 --> 01:28:59,227
At this point, I didn't know what was
more important to me--

1292
01:28:59,300 --> 01:29:01,530
Getting my money back
or getting even.

1293
01:29:01,602 --> 01:29:03,467
- You know what I'm here for?.
- Yeah, man.

1294
01:29:06,541 --> 01:29:08,873
You know I 'm retired.
Why you got to come to me with that?.

1295
01:29:08,943 --> 01:29:11,104
You know if I had a choice,
I'd never get you involved.

1296
01:29:11,179 --> 01:29:12,476
Take the gum
outyour mouth.

1297
01:29:16,818 --> 01:29:18,479
Take the gum
outyour mouth.

1298
01:29:21,356 --> 01:29:23,051
Put it under the table.

1299
01:29:33,067 --> 01:29:34,398
All right, man.

1300
01:29:34,469 --> 01:29:36,562
- You okay?.
- Yeah, definitely. Here.

1301
01:29:36,637 --> 01:29:38,036
Start the game, man.

1302
01:29:40,708 --> 01:29:42,437
Yeah. Yeah!

1303
01:29:42,510 --> 01:29:44,671
Well, sure.

1304
01:29:44,746 --> 01:29:48,409
All righty. Listen,
I gotta get going.

1305
01:29:48,483 --> 01:29:51,748
Mm-hmm. Okay.
I'll talk toyou soon.

1306
01:29:51,819 --> 01:29:53,810
All righty. Bye.

1307
01:29:55,723 --> 01:29:58,920
It's such a shame we have to leave
like this. I love it here.

1308
01:29:58,993 --> 01:30:01,052
You better be taking me
someplace warm.

1309
01:30:01,129 --> 01:30:03,120
- Oh, yeah.
- You know how much I love the sun.

1310
01:30:07,735 --> 01:30:09,930
Check this out.

1311
01:30:10,004 --> 01:30:12,598
- Put that away. You know I hate guns.
- Watch, watch.

1312
01:30:12,673 --> 01:30:14,197
Put it away.

1313
01:30:15,343 --> 01:30:18,107
Very good--
Don't point that!

1314
01:30:18,179 --> 01:30:20,170
- I'm putting it right here.
- Thankyou.

1315
01:30:24,852 --> 01:30:28,015
- I'm done!
- Finally.

1316
01:30:31,225 --> 01:30:33,216
- I'm gonna call the limo.
- Okay.

1317
01:30:43,504 --> 01:30:45,062
Oh, fuck!

1318
01:30:45,873 --> 01:30:47,397
Oh, fuck.

1319
01:30:48,910 --> 01:30:50,241
Fuck!

1320
01:30:51,946 --> 01:30:54,107
What's the matter,Jack?.

1321
01:30:54,182 --> 01:30:56,514
- You got nothing to say now?.
- I don't know what to say.

1322
01:30:56,584 --> 01:30:59,815
- You're so quick, man.
- I don't know what to fucking say!

1323
01:30:59,887 --> 01:31:03,152
You're not happy to see me, baby?.
Trish, move away from the bed.

1324
01:31:03,224 --> 01:31:05,784
-Just put the gun down.
- Move away from the fuckin' bed.

1325
01:31:05,860 --> 01:31:08,192
- Put your hands up and don't move.
- Put the gun down!

1326
01:31:08,262 --> 01:31:10,253
Shut up!
Shut up for one second!

1327
01:31:10,331 --> 01:31:11,923
Move away from the bed
and put your hands up.

1328
01:31:11,999 --> 01:31:13,432
Just put the gun down.

1329
01:31:13,501 --> 01:31:16,493
I know your type, man. I grew up with
you motherfucking get-over artists.

1330
01:31:16,571 --> 01:31:19,768
You're a fucking liar, man.
You been lying your whole fucking life.

1331
01:31:19,841 --> 01:31:23,299
You know what you are?. You're fucking
scum. You think that's your girlfriend?.

1332
01:31:23,377 --> 01:31:26,175
That gap, that gash?.
She's a fucking cavity, motherfucker.

1333
01:31:26,247 --> 01:31:28,841
You ain't got nobody. I had friends.
I had a fuckin' woman, man.

1334
01:31:28,916 --> 01:31:30,383
You got no kind of life.

1335
01:31:30,451 --> 01:31:33,420
You know what your mistake is, baby?.
You think you're too smart.

1336
01:31:33,488 --> 01:31:35,388
-Just put the gun down.
- Shut the fuck up!

1337
01:31:35,456 --> 01:31:37,014
You could've walked away
with $1 million...

1338
01:31:37,091 --> 01:31:39,184
but you fucked up,
'cause you pushed me too far.

1339
01:31:39,260 --> 01:31:41,421
- I know I fucked up.
- You put me in the hole.

1340
01:31:41,496 --> 01:31:43,225
I got nothing to fucking lose,
understand?.

1341
01:31:43,297 --> 01:31:45,094
Think about Carmen--

1342
01:31:45,166 --> 01:31:47,634
Never fuckin' say Carmen's name,
you fucking whore!

1343
01:31:47,702 --> 01:31:51,069
Just listen to me.
It's gonna be worked out, you know?.

1344
01:31:51,138 --> 01:31:54,039
- Put the fucking gun down!
- Shut the fuck up!

1345
01:31:54,108 --> 01:31:57,236
- Trish, where's the money?.
- In that fucking bag right there.

1346
01:31:57,311 --> 01:31:59,142
Fuck!

1347
01:31:59,947 --> 01:32:02,745
- Thank you, Trish.
- Idiot.

1348
01:32:02,817 --> 01:32:04,944
- How much is in there?.
- Listen to me.

1349
01:32:05,019 --> 01:32:09,388
$120,000. You need me!
You know you need me!

1350
01:32:09,457 --> 01:32:11,482
Jack, ifthat's your name--
What is your name?.

1351
01:32:11,559 --> 01:32:15,256
- I'm not telling you my name.
- Why shouldn't I kill you then?.

1352
01:32:15,329 --> 01:32:18,560
You want the money?.
The $4 million?. You need me!

1353
01:32:18,633 --> 01:32:20,658
I don't need you, you fuck.
You pushed me into the hole.

1354
01:32:20,735 --> 01:32:22,464
Be calm for one second.

1355
01:32:22,537 --> 01:32:25,233
You knowyou need me
to get that $4 million.

1356
01:32:25,306 --> 01:32:29,106
Ifyou want to be smart, you don't want
to be some fucking stupid spick--

1357
01:32:30,645 --> 01:32:33,273
Don't ever call me a spick,
you piece of white fucking trash!

1358
01:32:33,347 --> 01:32:35,338
Goddamn you!

1359
01:32:56,404 --> 01:32:58,065
Where's the money,Jack?.

1360
01:32:59,340 --> 01:33:00,967
Jack, come on.
Where's the money?.

1361
01:33:06,247 --> 01:33:08,545
Oh, God! Oh, God!

1362
01:33:08,616 --> 01:33:11,881
Tell me where the money is.
I don't want to have to kill you.

1363
01:33:11,953 --> 01:33:14,148
Ghetto piece of shit!

1364
01:33:46,320 --> 01:33:49,050
I took Carmen and her mother
back to Puerto Rico...

1365
01:33:49,123 --> 01:33:53,184
and with the money we opened
a small bar in the south of the island.

1366
01:33:53,260 --> 01:33:55,751
It's quiet most
of the time, but we get by.

1367
01:34:16,517 --> 01:34:19,111
How's everything going?.
Good?. Enjoying yourself?.

1368
01:34:19,186 --> 01:34:21,620
You have any complaints,
let me know. All right?.

1369
01:34:23,958 --> 01:34:27,894
It's time. Yeah.
We're at the hospital.

1370
01:34:27,962 --> 01:34:29,293
Okay. All right.

1371
01:34:29,363 --> 01:34:31,297
Tell Carmen to hold on.
I'll be right there.

1372
01:34:31,365 --> 01:34:33,925
Yeah, yeah. How is she?.
She's doing all right?.

1373
01:34:34,001 --> 01:34:36,799
Damn. Damn! It's coming.
My boy's coming, man.

1374
01:34:36,871 --> 01:34:39,305
Drinks on the house,
and close early!

1375
01:34:39,373 --> 01:34:41,739
It's kind of funny
when you think about it.

1376
01:34:41,809 --> 01:34:45,301
I mean, I did
some pretty bad things in my life.

1377
01:34:45,379 --> 01:34:49,008
Broke all the rules,
hurt a lot ofrpeople. But here I was.

1378
01:34:49,083 --> 01:34:53,213
My kid's lifre was about to begin,
and I had another chance.

1379
01:35:11,272 --> 01:35:16,107
Damn! Like I said befrore,
had I known what I know now.

1380
01:35:16,177 --> 01:35:19,874
I guess it was naive of me to think
I could actually get away with it.

1381
01:35:19,947 --> 01:35:22,677
Escape my past.

1382
01:35:22,750 --> 01:35:24,945
Yeah, but that's not
how it works...

1383
01:35:25,019 --> 01:35:29,319
'cause you know a man's actions
always have their consequences.

1384
01:35:29,390 --> 01:35:31,324
And deep down, I knew that.

1385
01:35:38,899 --> 01:35:40,230
Maybe what it's all about...

1386
01:35:40,301 --> 01:35:43,236
is thinking about someone else
instead of your self all the time.

1387
01:35:43,304 --> 01:35:45,465
Maybe that's what I was always missing.

1388
01:35:45,539 --> 01:35:49,066
IfrI can leave something fror my son,
maybe my life was worthwhile.

1389
01:35:49,143 --> 01:35:52,374
He 's so beautifrul.
I think I'm in love again.

1390
01:35:52,446 --> 01:35:54,141
He looks just like Victor.
