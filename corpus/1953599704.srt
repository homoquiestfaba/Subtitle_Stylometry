1
00:02:11,264 --> 00:02:13,858
Pa, you're missing the dancing.

2
00:02:21,708 --> 00:02:23,642
Are you all right?.

3
00:02:26,813 --> 00:02:28,280
Pa?.

4
00:02:34,554 --> 00:02:35,816
Suzannah's late.

5
00:02:36,523 --> 00:02:39,515
She'll be here.
It's a long ways from Austin.

6
00:02:39,692 --> 00:02:45,153
I don't care how far it is.
I want all three of my daughters here.

7
00:02:49,702 --> 00:02:55,538
By God, I'm old, ain't l, Claudia?.
As old as this land.

8
00:02:55,742 --> 00:02:58,540
As old as Texas, Pa.

9
00:02:59,145 --> 00:03:02,672
Come on.
Everybody's waiting.

10
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:28,166
There he is. Right there.

11
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:43,450
Pa.

12
00:03:43,656 --> 00:03:46,216
-Where is he?.
-He'll be along.

13
00:03:46,392 --> 00:03:50,021
Ungrateful lout.
Best not be keeping John Lear waiting.

14
00:03:50,196 --> 00:03:54,860
Now, don't worry about Thomas, Pa.
Let's go. Let's just go.

15
00:03:57,270 --> 00:04:00,034
Play on! Play on!

16
00:04:00,406 --> 00:04:02,601
Great to see you, sir.

17
00:04:02,775 --> 00:04:06,074
-Happy lndependence Day, sir.
-Thank you, sir.

18
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:07,907
Happy lndependence Day.

19
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:13,450
-I appreciate it.
-Henry.

20
00:04:14,854 --> 00:04:16,617
-Emmett.
-Mr. Lear, sir.

21
00:04:16,823 --> 00:04:20,919
-Fine-looking horse you have there.
-Best I've ever bred.

22
00:04:21,127 --> 00:04:26,087
Reminds me of that horse you rode
at San Jacinto. I want you to have it.

23
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:30,464
-That's mighty considerate, Henry.
-Mr. Lear.

24
00:04:35,642 --> 00:04:39,942
Your father just gave me this horse,
Thomas. It was thoughtful.

25
00:04:40,146 --> 00:04:43,411
I'm regretful
you weren't here to see it.

26
00:04:43,616 --> 00:04:46,517
Pa doesn't show
that side of himself often.

27
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:50,621
-Are you drunk, son?.
-Yes, sir. I've been drinking.

28
00:04:52,425 --> 00:04:56,919
It's a party, ain't it?.
Texas lndependence Day.

29
00:04:57,664 --> 00:05:03,000
There wouldn't be independence if
it weren't for men like your father.

30
00:05:03,169 --> 00:05:05,660
By God, you won't stand before him...

31
00:05:05,872 --> 00:05:11,674
...before me, with that mocking smile
on your face. I will not abide it, sir.

32
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:19,518
Henry, I'm much obliged to you.
This is as fine a horse as I've seen.

33
00:05:19,719 --> 00:05:22,187
-Thank you, John.
-Rip!

34
00:05:23,589 --> 00:05:27,116
-You take good care of this horse.
-Yes, sir.

35
00:05:32,565 --> 00:05:35,398
-Come on, Pa.
-What is wrong with you?.

36
00:05:35,601 --> 00:05:39,537
Does it please you to make
a fool out of your father?.

37
00:05:39,739 --> 00:05:41,730
To hell with you, boy!

38
00:05:50,049 --> 00:05:52,643
I've had enough of it, Emmett.

39
00:05:53,619 --> 00:05:57,385
-I had a whole lifetime of it.
-I know, I know.

40
00:06:01,094 --> 00:06:04,860
You still going to San Antonio
for a few days?.

41
00:06:05,064 --> 00:06:07,191
What do you mean?.

42
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:13,134
Just now might be a good time, is all.
I'll take on your chores, I don't mind.

43
00:06:13,339 --> 00:06:18,572
It'll give Pa a chance to cool down
and you a chance to think things over.

44
00:06:19,078 --> 00:06:22,172
Hell, I might do that right now.

45
00:06:46,773 --> 00:06:48,536
Thank you.

46
00:06:56,482 --> 00:07:00,316
-Rebecca.
-Suzannah. So glad to see you.

47
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:03,250
-How is he?.
-More unpredictable than ever.

48
00:07:03,456 --> 00:07:07,893
-Has he done anything crazy?.
-No, but it's still early.

49
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:12,354
Hello, Pa.

50
00:07:14,634 --> 00:07:17,569
-How are you?.
-I'm tolerable. You're late.

51
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:20,831
-Mr. Tumlinson.
-Happy lndependence Day.

52
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,667
Claudia!

53
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:27,011
You've been taking good care of him.
He's ornery as ever.

54
00:07:27,213 --> 00:07:33,083
By God, I am. Come on up to the house,
I got something to tell you gals.

55
00:07:33,252 --> 00:07:34,241
Come on.

56
00:07:34,787 --> 00:07:36,948
Whoa, now!

57
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,827
Close the gate!

58
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:02,008
Lear!

59
00:08:02,548 --> 00:08:04,709
John Lear!

60
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:07,548
Where are you?.

61
00:08:13,559 --> 00:08:16,494
-You hung two of my vaqueros!
-Vaqueros?.

62
00:08:16,696 --> 00:08:21,963
They were cattle thieves.
They butchered a cow with my brand.

63
00:08:22,134 --> 00:08:25,126
They were starving.
You drove them from their land.

64
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:29,001
It's my land, Menchaca, my cattle.

65
00:08:29,208 --> 00:08:34,578
You hung two men for one cow!
What kind of man are you?.

66
00:08:34,747 --> 00:08:39,013
You know what kind of man I am.
Your father knowed it too.

67
00:08:39,418 --> 00:08:44,219
My father would have shot you
dead already, viejo!

68
00:08:45,591 --> 00:08:51,154
You're welcome to try that.
Why don't you try that right now?.

69
00:09:02,742 --> 00:09:05,575
-This is not over.
-Si. Claro.

70
00:09:05,745 --> 00:09:09,681
Now, get off my land
before I hang you too.

71
00:09:16,289 --> 00:09:21,352
Should have driven him right across
the Rio Grande when we had a chance.

72
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:24,155
It's not too late for that.

73
00:09:30,436 --> 00:09:33,269
President Houston
asked me to deliver this.

74
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:38,536
How is Sam?. He ever sober up any?.
Where'd I put my spectacles?.

75
00:09:38,711 --> 00:09:43,705
-It's a proclamation. Shall I read it?.
-Oh, hell, I suppose so.

76
00:09:44,951 --> 00:09:49,479
"On this anniversary of the birth
of our republic, we honor the man...

77
00:09:49,655 --> 00:09:54,388
...without whose valiant spirit
Texas would never have been won.

78
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:58,587
During the darkest days of our
struggle, when the Alamo fell...

79
00:09:58,764 --> 00:10:02,632
...when his own beloved son
was martyred at Goliad, John Lear--"

80
00:10:02,835 --> 00:10:05,998
All right, Tumlinson,
I get the point of it.

81
00:10:06,205 --> 00:10:10,608
Houston always was a long-winded,
preachifying son of a bitch.

82
00:10:12,211 --> 00:10:15,738
But I got more important matters
to discuss today.

83
00:10:15,982 --> 00:10:19,418
There's the Palo Blanco...

84
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:22,281
...all 200,000 acres of it.

85
00:10:23,122 --> 00:10:24,749
There's the main house.

86
00:10:24,957 --> 00:10:28,916
There's your place, Rebecca.
Every creek in between.

87
00:10:29,595 --> 00:10:33,087
Every acre paid for in blood.

88
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,629
Always thought I'd turn the place
over to my boy...

89
00:10:38,738 --> 00:10:41,866
...but he's dead and gone.

90
00:10:43,342 --> 00:10:48,211
It's come to me how my life
ain't been more concern...

91
00:10:48,414 --> 00:10:52,714
...to this land than a blade of grass
or a mesquite tree.

92
00:10:52,918 --> 00:10:57,912
Just one more thing that lived on it
and had its day and passed on.

93
00:10:58,090 --> 00:11:00,581
But by God...

94
00:11:01,027 --> 00:11:04,019
...I can still decide who owns it.

95
00:11:04,764 --> 00:11:08,564
I have decided to divide up the ranch.

96
00:11:12,872 --> 00:11:16,273
-What do you mean, Daddy?.
-As from today...

97
00:11:16,442 --> 00:11:19,878
...I am giving the ranch over
to you three gals.

98
00:11:20,246 --> 00:11:25,707
I wanna get all this settled now
so there won't be any fighting...

99
00:11:25,918 --> 00:11:28,216
...amongst you after I'm gone.

100
00:11:28,421 --> 00:11:32,050
-Are you feeling all right?.
-I'm feeling fine, Claudia.

101
00:11:32,591 --> 00:11:36,652
I'm even gonna lead the roundup
this year, like always.

102
00:11:36,862 --> 00:11:41,856
But I won't be here forever,
and I wanna get this settled.

103
00:11:42,068 --> 00:11:44,901
And who gets which part of the land?.

104
00:11:45,104 --> 00:11:48,562
Well, Suzannah,
I suppose that depends.

105
00:11:48,941 --> 00:11:50,272
On what?.

106
00:11:53,479 --> 00:11:58,781
On who loves their father the most.

107
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:05,047
Go ahead, you're the eldest, Suzannah.
Speak up.

108
00:12:12,798 --> 00:12:16,962
There's no man in this country
who can stand next to my father.

109
00:12:17,136 --> 00:12:20,162
No man who ever could.

110
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:26,000
You came to Texas with nothing...

111
00:12:26,212 --> 00:12:29,909
...and you made an empire.

112
00:12:30,082 --> 00:12:33,677
Maybe you were hard,
but that's because you had to be.

113
00:12:33,853 --> 00:12:39,189
If you hadn't been, we would've been
carried away by Comanches years ago.

114
00:12:39,358 --> 00:12:42,225
So I love you for your strength.

115
00:12:42,461 --> 00:12:45,658
And I love you for the strength
you gave me.

116
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:51,999
I'll give you all the land
east of Las Animas Creek.

117
00:12:52,204 --> 00:12:56,334
There's good range there,
all the way up to the headwaters.

118
00:12:56,542 --> 00:13:00,342
-But your house is on that side.
-I know that, Suzannah.

119
00:13:00,546 --> 00:13:04,949
I'll move downstairs. You and
your husband can move in up here.

120
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:09,212
I'll spend half the year with you
and half at Rebecca's.

121
00:13:09,388 --> 00:13:11,754
That appeal to you, Mr. Tumlinson?.

122
00:13:11,957 --> 00:13:15,620
Oh, yes. Yes, indeed.
It's very generous.

123
00:13:23,335 --> 00:13:25,098
Now, Rebecca.

124
00:13:26,672 --> 00:13:30,130
-Daddy, I don't know what to say.
-You don't?.

125
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:41,143
If I had Suzannah's way with words,
I could tell you how much I love you.

126
00:13:41,554 --> 00:13:45,115
Hush, Claudia. You'll get your turn.

127
00:13:47,193 --> 00:13:51,789
It's not a speaking thing.
It's a feeling thing.

128
00:13:51,964 --> 00:13:56,367
It's the same feeling when I ride
across the prairie before dawn...

129
00:13:56,569 --> 00:13:59,470
...and the sun comes up
and warms my face...

130
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:02,869
...and all the wildflower blossoms
start to open.

131
00:14:03,809 --> 00:14:07,142
That's how much I love you, Daddy.

132
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:10,713
Like I love the sun.

133
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:17,046
I'll give you all the land
west of the creek--

134
00:14:17,256 --> 00:14:18,416
Sir.

135
00:14:19,959 --> 00:14:24,396
The soil in there gets very salty.
It's not good for grazing.

136
00:14:24,597 --> 00:14:27,725
I know that.
You hold your horses, Highsmith.

137
00:14:27,933 --> 00:14:29,833
All land west of the creek...

138
00:14:30,035 --> 00:14:33,664
...and south of the ruins
of that old Spanish fort.

139
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:37,604
-You like that any better?.
-Yes, sir. I do.

140
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:50,913
Now, Claudia, I'll listen to you.
There's some prime land left.

141
00:14:51,123 --> 00:14:53,216
I have nothing to say.

142
00:14:55,661 --> 00:14:57,891
What did she say?.

143
00:14:58,264 --> 00:15:01,529
She said she had nothing to say.

144
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:03,599
-Nothing?.
-Nothing!

145
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:08,231
Nothing can come of nothing.
You best think again.

146
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:11,932
I won't. This is false.
I want nothing to do with it.

147
00:15:12,678 --> 00:15:15,909
False?. What do you mean, false?.

148
00:15:16,448 --> 00:15:20,214
Heed your words, unless you
wanna throw away your fortune.

149
00:15:20,386 --> 00:15:23,446
A child either loves her father
or she doesn't.

150
00:15:23,622 --> 00:15:26,591
-Yes!
-Well, say it.

151
00:15:27,826 --> 00:15:31,592
-Why won't you say it?.
-Because you should see it, Pa.

152
00:15:31,797 --> 00:15:36,598
Don't I prove my love to you every day,
living here, taking care of you?.

153
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:39,101
Suzannah and Rebecca took husbands.

154
00:15:39,271 --> 00:15:42,297
She's just proud.
She's her father's daughter.

155
00:15:42,508 --> 00:15:44,840
You keep out of this, Tumlinson.

156
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:47,511
Say it, Claudia.

157
00:15:47,713 --> 00:15:52,275
Love isn't something you can command.
It's either there or it's not.

158
00:15:52,718 --> 00:15:54,777
Say it.

159
00:15:55,521 --> 00:15:57,853
-No.
-Say it!

160
00:15:58,057 --> 00:16:00,890
John, I think if you consider--

161
00:16:03,228 --> 00:16:06,891
What kind of child is this?.

162
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:10,632
Is this a child
I sheltered in my house?.

163
00:16:10,836 --> 00:16:13,498
A child I gave my heart to?.

164
00:16:13,706 --> 00:16:17,540
She's got no more feeling
than a low-down rattlesnake!

165
00:16:17,743 --> 00:16:20,268
It's because I have too much feeling--

166
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:23,607
All these years, pretending
to love your father...

167
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:27,843
...when all you had inside you
was hateful poison!

168
00:16:28,053 --> 00:16:31,955
By God, I won't keep no rattler
in this house!

169
00:16:32,157 --> 00:16:34,557
-You have no portion!
-That's enough!

170
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:38,958
Who the hell are you, telling John Lear
how much he can speak?.!

171
00:16:39,298 --> 00:16:42,790
-Pa.
-Too late, Claudia! I won't listen!

172
00:16:43,168 --> 00:16:48,401
I won't look into your face ever again!
You have no home! No father!

173
00:16:49,274 --> 00:16:51,640
Go! Get!

174
00:16:52,945 --> 00:16:58,406
-You can't send her away like this--
-Keep your silence in my presence.

175
00:16:58,617 --> 00:17:03,554
Or, by God, I will strike you down!
You understand me, sir?.

176
00:17:09,561 --> 00:17:13,930
Why are you still here?.
Get out of my house.

177
00:17:33,485 --> 00:17:38,718
I will divide the ranch equally
between you two gals and your husbands.

178
00:17:44,196 --> 00:17:47,097
-Daddy!
-Don't say nothing to me, Rebecca.

179
00:17:47,299 --> 00:17:49,927
I don't care to hear it.

180
00:17:50,302 --> 00:17:52,896
I bid you all good day.

181
00:17:54,973 --> 00:17:57,840
It'll be all right.
He'll come to his senses.

182
00:17:58,043 --> 00:18:01,035
No, he won't.
He won't ever let me come back.

183
00:18:01,213 --> 00:18:04,910
Suzannah and I will be living here.
We'll talk to him.

184
00:18:05,551 --> 00:18:07,212
Come on.

185
00:18:14,426 --> 00:18:17,953
The division north to south
along the creek is fair.

186
00:18:18,163 --> 00:18:22,623
-Does it suit you, Mr. Highsmith?.
-I'll tell you what will suit me.

187
00:18:22,835 --> 00:18:24,462
That's Menchaca's land.

188
00:18:24,636 --> 00:18:29,130
Menchaca says it is.
It's disputed land. Everybody knows it.

189
00:18:29,341 --> 00:18:33,471
-A man could run a lot of cattle there.
-And start another war.

190
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:36,204
We never finished the last one.

191
00:18:36,381 --> 00:18:39,441
-My husband wouldn't allow it.
-Of course not.

192
00:18:40,018 --> 00:18:44,421
Your husband's a good man.
Member of the Texas government.

193
00:18:45,557 --> 00:18:51,154
But isn't he going back to Austin soon
to meet with the legislature?.

194
00:18:51,563 --> 00:18:56,057
-I don't know--
-Hush. I'm talking to your sister.

195
00:18:57,903 --> 00:18:59,564
Now, you and l...

196
00:18:59,738 --> 00:19:03,037
...we know a fight with Menchaca
is inevitable.

197
00:19:03,242 --> 00:19:08,839
We've got to get the first lick in
if we're to have any hope of victory.

198
00:19:14,086 --> 00:19:15,553
Claudia?.

199
00:19:19,091 --> 00:19:22,857
Miss Claudia!
Miss Claudia, where are you going?.

200
00:20:28,794 --> 00:20:31,262
What has happened, Claudia?.

201
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,868
He turned me out.

202
00:20:38,036 --> 00:20:39,697
Your father?.

203
00:21:02,694 --> 00:21:05,390
-You shouldn't be so hard on Thomas.
-Why not?.

204
00:21:05,597 --> 00:21:09,499
If I hadn't promised his mother
the ranch would be his--

205
00:21:09,701 --> 00:21:14,638
No use speaking about that.
I learned to live with being a bastard.

206
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:17,775
And the ranch ain't big enough
to split up.

207
00:21:17,976 --> 00:21:20,467
Where are the horses?.

208
00:21:43,835 --> 00:21:46,395
They're all gone, Pa!

209
00:21:51,143 --> 00:21:53,008
Placido.

210
00:21:56,081 --> 00:21:59,278
I'm gonna kill the man that done this.

211
00:22:00,652 --> 00:22:02,176
Careful.

212
00:22:04,389 --> 00:22:08,883
-Put it on the far side of the parlor.
-Si, senora.

213
00:22:12,898 --> 00:22:14,263
Music!

214
00:22:14,466 --> 00:22:18,596
That's what this house has been
missing since your ma passed on.

215
00:22:18,804 --> 00:22:21,602
You're making this
a proper home again.

216
00:22:21,807 --> 00:22:26,904
After a week or two on the campo,
I might want a tune out of this piano.

217
00:22:27,079 --> 00:22:29,809
-I'll play you one.
-Make me a peach pie.

218
00:22:30,015 --> 00:22:33,576
After a roundup,
I'm partial to peach pie.

219
00:22:33,785 --> 00:22:35,810
I will, Pa.

220
00:22:36,421 --> 00:22:39,049
-Warnell.
-Ma'am.

221
00:22:39,257 --> 00:22:41,851
Keep an eye on him.

222
00:22:42,794 --> 00:22:44,455
Yes, ma'am.

223
00:22:44,663 --> 00:22:46,255
Morning, men!

224
00:22:46,865 --> 00:22:51,165
-Fine day for a roundup.
-You're right about that, boss.

225
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:53,600
You too old to go on a roundup.

226
00:22:53,805 --> 00:22:57,707
I ain't particularly interested
in your opinion, Rip.

227
00:22:58,110 --> 00:22:59,509
I know that.

228
00:22:59,878 --> 00:23:03,211
You never been interested
in anybody's opinion.

229
00:23:03,415 --> 00:23:07,943
-You fall off and you break your neck.
-I don't intend to fall off.

230
00:23:09,121 --> 00:23:13,990
Well, I expect you never intended
to get so damn old, either.

231
00:23:15,794 --> 00:23:18,524
Rip, saddle your horse.

232
00:23:19,364 --> 00:23:21,730
-Why?.
-Because you're going with me.

233
00:23:22,434 --> 00:23:24,800
I believe I'll stay right here.

234
00:23:25,003 --> 00:23:28,495
This place gets pleasant
when you ain't around.

235
00:23:28,707 --> 00:23:32,336
It ain't my business
to make your life pleasant.

236
00:23:32,544 --> 00:23:34,944
-You're going with us.
-Why?.

237
00:23:35,213 --> 00:23:39,741
Because you're the only son of a bitch
that could make me laugh.

238
00:23:40,118 --> 00:23:42,348
Mount up, men!

239
00:23:51,963 --> 00:23:54,625
Rip, over there, in the flank!

240
00:24:05,377 --> 00:24:07,402
Get along, there!

241
00:24:21,893 --> 00:24:26,489
By God, this is a tonic
being out here again.

242
00:24:26,865 --> 00:24:32,667
I don't think nothing suits me better
than hard country and wild cattle.

243
00:24:32,838 --> 00:24:36,205
Rip, you sing me a song.

244
00:24:59,798 --> 00:25:02,926
Maybe you need to come live
among these cows...

245
00:25:03,134 --> 00:25:07,332
...since your singing voice ain't fit
for no human to hear.

246
00:25:07,539 --> 00:25:12,738
By God, Rip, I don't know
why I let you talk to me that way.

247
00:25:12,944 --> 00:25:17,813
If you were a mite brainier, you'd
watch your tongue, have fear of me.

248
00:25:18,016 --> 00:25:21,179
All the fear got scared out of me
at the Alamo.

249
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:34,260
Who the hell's that?.

250
00:25:38,803 --> 00:25:41,101
-Afternoon.
-Afternoon to you, sir.

251
00:25:41,306 --> 00:25:44,036
-You would be Mr. Westover?.
-That's right.

252
00:25:44,209 --> 00:25:48,339
-Lieutenant Williams, U.S. Army.
-What can I do for you?.

253
00:25:48,547 --> 00:25:53,177
I was hoping you'd have more horses
to sell. Army needs good stock.

254
00:25:53,351 --> 00:25:55,182
I never sold horses to no Army.

255
00:25:55,387 --> 00:26:00,415
They had your brand on them.
It was a legal transaction.

256
00:26:01,092 --> 00:26:04,960
-How many was it you bought?.
-I believe it was 1 8.

257
00:26:07,799 --> 00:26:11,360
-Who sold them to you?.
-Didn't care to give his name.

258
00:26:11,536 --> 00:26:15,336
-What did he look like?. A Mexican?.
-He weren't Mexican.

259
00:26:15,507 --> 00:26:18,704
He had some height to him,
brown hair...

260
00:26:19,244 --> 00:26:22,771
...and as I recollect
he had a scar on his forehead.

261
00:26:22,981 --> 00:26:27,145
Didn't look like no horse thief,
if that's what you're thinking.

262
00:26:29,955 --> 00:26:34,221
Better move on, mister.
Ain't no horses for sale here.

263
00:26:34,426 --> 00:26:38,726
Sorry to trouble you, then.
Good day to you both.

264
00:26:45,737 --> 00:26:47,796
I'm sure it's a mistake.

265
00:26:48,006 --> 00:26:50,600
Of course it's a mistake.

266
00:26:56,781 --> 00:26:58,942
Eighteen horses, Emmett, 1 8!

267
00:26:59,651 --> 00:27:04,315
That man said he had a scar
on his forehead like Thomas has.

268
00:27:04,823 --> 00:27:07,758
Thomas would never
do anything like that.

269
00:27:07,926 --> 00:27:13,865
He'd never steal from his own father.
You just put it out of your mind, Pa.

270
00:27:26,878 --> 00:27:28,937
Bring them up, there.

271
00:27:49,868 --> 00:27:52,632
Hard work. Mind if I water my horse?.

272
00:27:53,471 --> 00:27:55,632
Just your horse.

273
00:27:55,807 --> 00:28:01,211
Because I wouldn't want no slave
to foul this water by drinking from it.

274
00:28:03,014 --> 00:28:06,040
I told you not to do that.

275
00:28:09,354 --> 00:28:13,313
You're that son of a bitch
from the Alamo, aren't you?.

276
00:28:37,816 --> 00:28:42,879
Did you ever notice how a mesquite
branch is all covered with thorns?.

277
00:28:44,522 --> 00:28:49,425
The Lord was thinking about runaway
slaves when he created that tree.

278
00:28:49,594 --> 00:28:52,358
I ain't no runaway slave.

279
00:28:54,299 --> 00:28:57,462
How's a feller to know any different?.

280
00:28:57,736 --> 00:29:00,227
You got a paper saying you ain't?.

281
00:29:00,438 --> 00:29:05,273
You got a paper saying you ain't
a pea-brained son of a bitch?.

282
00:29:07,245 --> 00:29:10,078
Well, now, did that hurt enough?.

283
00:29:18,490 --> 00:29:21,618
I thought he was
running away from you.

284
00:29:21,826 --> 00:29:25,785
I thought he was stealing that horse
and running away--

285
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:39,065
No, no! Don't hit me no more, boss.

286
00:29:39,277 --> 00:29:42,178
You gonna interfere
with my property again?.

287
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:44,439
No, sir, I ain't.

288
00:29:49,754 --> 00:29:52,188
Get the hell out of here!

289
00:30:03,034 --> 00:30:07,971
I believe one of the boys in the outfit
has got some aloe salve.

290
00:30:08,173 --> 00:30:12,872
I appreciate it, but then
my shirt's all ripped to hell.

291
00:30:13,044 --> 00:30:16,480
Why you telling me?.
I ain't no damn seamstress.

292
00:30:19,484 --> 00:30:22,317
I ain't never took you for one.

293
00:30:24,055 --> 00:30:28,458
You get on your horse
before we waste any more time.

294
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:43,403
-You're heading home, I see.
-Time to go to our part of the ranch.

295
00:30:43,641 --> 00:30:49,170
As you know, my husband will be gone
for several weeks, at least.

296
00:30:50,715 --> 00:30:52,706
What do you have in mind?.

297
00:30:52,917 --> 00:30:55,977
Let's not play games, Mr. Highsmith.

298
00:30:59,591 --> 00:31:02,651
-We'll need men.
-I have a dozen at my ranch.

299
00:31:02,861 --> 00:31:06,558
-We'll need more.
-We should talk to Mr. Westover.

300
00:31:06,965 --> 00:31:11,902
If the man who captured Santa Ana
joins us, others will too.

301
00:31:13,705 --> 00:31:15,696
She's right.

302
00:31:15,874 --> 00:31:21,870
Westover's always game for a fight.
He'll want to know where Lear stands.

303
00:31:23,581 --> 00:31:26,709
Tell him my father stands with us.

304
00:31:40,732 --> 00:31:44,634
I hope you brought your brother
something from San Antonio.

305
00:31:44,802 --> 00:31:47,930
A bottle of whiskey
might be just the thing.

306
00:31:49,607 --> 00:31:51,199
Where's the horses?.

307
00:31:51,409 --> 00:31:57,405
You best ask Pa about that. He's inside
taking supper. I'll see to your gear.

308
00:32:10,662 --> 00:32:12,892
Hey, how you doing, Pa?.

309
00:32:13,898 --> 00:32:15,991
Where's the horses?.

310
00:32:16,234 --> 00:32:18,065
Stoled.

311
00:32:20,571 --> 00:32:24,063
Stole?. All of them?.

312
00:32:25,910 --> 00:32:27,639
Oh, hell, where's Placido?.

313
00:32:28,046 --> 00:32:32,073
You know damn well where he is.
Lying in his grave.

314
00:32:32,984 --> 00:32:34,918
He's what?.

315
00:32:35,653 --> 00:32:38,747
I don't know why
you would do such a thing.

316
00:32:38,957 --> 00:32:45,226
But I guess if a man's got enough hate
in his heart, he can do anything.

317
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:51,898
You think I stole our horses?.
That I killed Placido?.

318
00:32:52,870 --> 00:32:57,034
Look at me, Pa. Look at me!

319
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:04,714
-You think I stole them horses.
-I do.

320
00:33:04,916 --> 00:33:08,545
Boy, I don't see that bottle
of whiskey in here.

321
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:12,583
Hell, you must really hate me.

322
00:33:12,790 --> 00:33:18,353
I drink some and I shoot my mouth off.
But I ain't no thief and no murderer!

323
00:33:25,370 --> 00:33:27,702
-Pa, that ain't mine.
-Liar!

324
00:33:28,206 --> 00:33:31,733
You're a liar, a horse thief
and a murderer!

325
00:33:31,909 --> 00:33:35,811
-You lost your mind with age, old man!
-Get out.

326
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:38,949
Get out of my house.

327
00:33:45,356 --> 00:33:48,018
Don't you never come back.

328
00:34:17,221 --> 00:34:20,213
I thought you'd forgotten
all about me.

329
00:34:24,762 --> 00:34:28,755
How was my performance?.
Think I should take to the boards?.

330
00:34:28,966 --> 00:34:30,365
You really should.

331
00:34:31,569 --> 00:34:35,198
Me and my men have done
right by you, Mr. Westover.

332
00:34:36,407 --> 00:34:41,071
Made a good profit from them horses.
Fifty-fifty, just like we said.

333
00:34:41,779 --> 00:34:46,773
Do you mind if I keep the uniform?.
I admire the way I look in it.

334
00:34:56,627 --> 00:34:59,152
You can keep the uniform.

335
00:35:07,805 --> 00:35:10,035
A fair increase, Suzannah.

336
00:35:10,241 --> 00:35:15,110
Hardly a cow this year
without a calf to suck on her.

337
00:35:15,713 --> 00:35:18,944
I hope to hell
you made that peach pie.

338
00:35:19,317 --> 00:35:23,913
-You beat Warnell half to death.
-He was torturing Rip.

339
00:35:24,922 --> 00:35:28,551
You should've come to me.
I would have dealt with it.

340
00:35:28,759 --> 00:35:32,286
Come to you?.
That'll be a cold day in hell.

341
00:35:32,463 --> 00:35:35,728
I can take care of my own business.

342
00:35:36,234 --> 00:35:42,139
-This coffee's cold as well water.
-You gave up business, did you forget?.

343
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:46,640
If one of my men needs to be punished,
I will do the deciding.

344
00:35:47,345 --> 00:35:51,076
You will watch your tongue with me.
Get some supper on!

345
00:35:51,249 --> 00:35:54,309
My men are hungry.
They've been herding cattle.

346
00:35:54,485 --> 00:35:59,889
I'll feed your men. But don't expect
any hospitality. You won't find it.

347
00:36:00,458 --> 00:36:04,224
-Not after what you did to Warnell.
-Show some respect.

348
00:36:04,395 --> 00:36:09,298
Respect. Respect for you,
you pathetic, addled old man.

349
00:36:09,867 --> 00:36:15,533
Riling me is pleasurable, ain't it?.
Rile me more, and you will be sorry.

350
00:36:16,974 --> 00:36:23,038
Now, you get some supper on.
For me and for my men.

351
00:36:29,654 --> 00:36:32,487
There you go. Give me another one.

352
00:36:37,828 --> 00:36:42,595
-What are you doing?.
-We're raising holy hell, Suzannah!

353
00:36:42,767 --> 00:36:45,099
Well, you stop it right now!

354
00:36:45,636 --> 00:36:49,868
I won't have your men shooting
off their guns around my house.

355
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:53,340
You'll have it
if I say you'll have it.

356
00:36:56,314 --> 00:36:59,078
I want to see you make that bell ring.

357
00:37:00,585 --> 00:37:02,951
Better ring that bell.

358
00:37:04,555 --> 00:37:06,045
Get out of here!

359
00:37:08,793 --> 00:37:13,526
-Leave my house.
-Your house?. This is my house.

360
00:37:13,698 --> 00:37:16,064
Not anymore.

361
00:37:23,307 --> 00:37:27,937
By God, you'd do it, wouldn't you?.
You'd kill your own father.

362
00:37:30,514 --> 00:37:35,542
You men, go on, now.
Go on to the bunkhouse.

363
00:37:39,624 --> 00:37:44,755
-Go on! Do as I tell you!
-They won't obey you. They work for me.

364
00:37:44,929 --> 00:37:47,727
No, they don't. They work for me.

365
00:37:47,932 --> 00:37:51,732
You hear that?. You work for me!

366
00:37:51,902 --> 00:37:56,202
If you don't do as I say,
you'll never see your wages again.

367
00:37:56,407 --> 00:37:59,843
I own the ranch now!

368
00:38:03,414 --> 00:38:07,942
-Mr. Lear?.
-Go on. Do like she says.

369
00:38:08,819 --> 00:38:12,346
You and the rest of the men,
get out of here.

370
00:38:12,523 --> 00:38:16,425
Go on, get out of here! All of you!

371
00:38:32,410 --> 00:38:34,275
Why?.

372
00:38:35,379 --> 00:38:37,847
Why, Suzannah?.

373
00:38:39,784 --> 00:38:42,116
Why have you turned against me?.

374
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:45,778
I gave you the ranch.
I gave you everything!

375
00:38:45,956 --> 00:38:51,553
You didn't give it to me, Pa.
You sold it to me.

376
00:38:52,463 --> 00:38:56,991
You came up with the price
and I met it.

377
00:38:57,168 --> 00:39:00,399
And don't you think
that price came easy to me.

378
00:39:00,571 --> 00:39:06,203
Having to say I loved you, when
all I've ever felt for you was hate.

379
00:39:06,377 --> 00:39:07,742
Hate?.

380
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:15,444
You are nothing but an old tyrant.
That's all you are.

381
00:39:15,653 --> 00:39:18,622
You worked our mother to death.

382
00:39:18,789 --> 00:39:23,692
And you never took no notice
of Rebecca or me.

383
00:39:25,196 --> 00:39:27,289
Ever.

384
00:39:27,465 --> 00:39:30,298
All you cared about was your son.

385
00:39:30,501 --> 00:39:35,165
And after he died,
all you cared about was Claudia.

386
00:39:35,373 --> 00:39:40,003
Well, they're gone now,
and your day is over.

387
00:39:40,311 --> 00:39:42,779
No, it ain't over.

388
00:39:43,714 --> 00:39:45,682
And when it's over...

389
00:39:45,850 --> 00:39:50,913
...I'll rise up out of the pit,
and I'll haunt you to your grave!

390
00:39:52,256 --> 00:39:54,724
I'll do something.

391
00:39:55,359 --> 00:40:00,387
I don't know what, but you'll
be sorry you lived to see it!

392
00:40:06,337 --> 00:40:09,329
I remember the day you were born.

393
00:40:09,507 --> 00:40:14,945
Your ma held you up to me and she
said, "John, here is your daughter."

394
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:20,311
And you were a fine, healthy child.

395
00:40:20,484 --> 00:40:25,012
And I had a tender feeling
in my heart for you that day.

396
00:40:25,523 --> 00:40:28,617
But that feeling is gone
from my heart.

397
00:40:29,026 --> 00:40:34,623
You're dead to me now,
dead as winter grass!

398
00:40:34,799 --> 00:40:37,597
I only got one daughter now!

399
00:40:37,802 --> 00:40:41,636
Well, she's welcome to have you!

400
00:41:21,345 --> 00:41:26,009
I hope Miss Highsmith'll be happier
to see you than Miss Tumlinson.

401
00:41:26,183 --> 00:41:30,483
Rebecca's a devoted child.
The only one in the bunch.

402
00:41:30,688 --> 00:41:33,555
-You sure of that?.
-Yes, I'm sure.

403
00:41:34,758 --> 00:41:36,282
She told me so.

404
00:41:39,663 --> 00:41:42,894
-What?.
-I used to think old people was wise.

405
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:46,069
But they ain't.
You sure the proof of that.

406
00:41:46,237 --> 00:41:50,867
I never said I was wise.
I never boasted about a damn thing.

407
00:41:53,744 --> 00:41:56,304
Why do my children hate me, Rip?.

408
00:41:59,083 --> 00:42:03,850
-Don't ask if you don't want the truth.
-You tell me.

409
00:42:04,054 --> 00:42:08,787
Because there ain't
no love in you. Only pride.

410
00:42:12,830 --> 00:42:14,730
I'm in a hurtful way, Rip.

411
00:42:15,399 --> 00:42:19,096
The way I deal with pain is
to pretend it's done with.

412
00:42:19,303 --> 00:42:21,737
-What do you mean?.
-What I mean is...

413
00:42:22,039 --> 00:42:24,872
...I think of myself like I was dead.

414
00:42:25,075 --> 00:42:30,536
Supposed to be, anyway. I was
supposed to be killed at the Alamo.

415
00:42:31,115 --> 00:42:33,413
So I'm a ghost, I reckon.

416
00:42:33,617 --> 00:42:38,680
Pain don't bother me none. People
don't either. All that's done with.

417
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:51,964
Where are you going?.

418
00:43:24,001 --> 00:43:27,266
I think Rebecca's house is over there.

419
00:43:28,072 --> 00:43:31,235
Yeah. Just behind
the shoulder of that hill.

420
00:43:31,442 --> 00:43:34,411
Yes, that's it.

421
00:43:34,612 --> 00:43:37,513
Well, I'm all right now.

422
00:43:37,715 --> 00:43:42,084
I just got a little turned
around there for a while.

423
00:43:42,286 --> 00:43:45,255
Her house ain't thataway.

424
00:43:52,896 --> 00:43:55,262
-You sure?.
-I'm sure.

425
00:43:57,668 --> 00:44:01,001
It ain't right that I should be lost.

426
00:44:01,205 --> 00:44:06,666
This is my land. I own it. I know it.

427
00:44:06,844 --> 00:44:11,713
By God, I created
this land out of nothing.

428
00:44:15,853 --> 00:44:19,846
Come on, now.
We'll find Miss Highsmith's house.

429
00:44:28,065 --> 00:44:30,590
Am I going mad, Rip?.

430
00:44:32,269 --> 00:44:34,066
I don't know.

431
00:44:36,974 --> 00:44:39,772
Don't let me go mad, Rip.

432
00:44:40,477 --> 00:44:42,377
You shoot me first.

433
00:44:55,159 --> 00:44:56,820
You can attack soon.

434
00:44:56,994 --> 00:45:01,090
-But how does Lear stand on this?.
-Lear is with us.

435
00:45:01,265 --> 00:45:04,359
John Lear's a careful man
for all his temper.

436
00:45:04,968 --> 00:45:07,869
-He must see some advantage to it.
-He does.

437
00:45:08,072 --> 00:45:11,838
-How many men would we need?.
-About 1 00 men.

438
00:45:12,042 --> 00:45:17,139
Menchaca's got a lot of vaqueros
at his place and two six-pounders.

439
00:45:17,347 --> 00:45:23,343
-We need some cannons ourselves.
-We'll get it, especially if you join.

440
00:45:34,998 --> 00:45:38,263
Your husband got himself
a bold notion.

441
00:45:39,036 --> 00:45:43,837
-He's a bold man.
-Reckless one is what I heard.

442
00:45:44,041 --> 00:45:48,273
And mean. The sort of man that
might take after his own wife.

443
00:45:48,445 --> 00:45:52,609
-That's hateful gossip.
-Don't mean it ain't true.

444
00:45:54,685 --> 00:45:56,915
You worried about me?.

445
00:45:57,087 --> 00:45:58,987
It's possible I am.

446
00:45:59,957 --> 00:46:02,824
Your pa listens to you.

447
00:46:03,026 --> 00:46:06,553
-Make sure he joins us.
-Why?.

448
00:46:06,730 --> 00:46:11,929
Because there's gain to be had.
Land and cattle.

449
00:46:12,102 --> 00:46:14,662
And other things.

450
00:46:28,185 --> 00:46:30,085
Rebecca?.

451
00:46:34,458 --> 00:46:36,483
Rebecca!

452
00:46:39,129 --> 00:46:40,926
John, welcome.

453
00:46:46,770 --> 00:46:51,366
Come in and take a horn with me.
We've got some business to discuss.

454
00:46:51,975 --> 00:46:55,274
That I will. Rebecca.

455
00:46:57,347 --> 00:47:01,181
Rebecca, I went to your house
looking for you.

456
00:47:01,785 --> 00:47:05,846
They told me you were here.
I needed you, Rebecca.

457
00:47:11,061 --> 00:47:14,189
Something happen to Suzannah?.

458
00:47:15,566 --> 00:47:18,194
She turned me out.

459
00:47:19,570 --> 00:47:22,471
-Well, I'm sure she didn't mean to.
-No.

460
00:47:22,673 --> 00:47:29,044
You know the respect a child owes her
father. You're the only one that does.

461
00:47:36,253 --> 00:47:39,245
-Why are you here?.
-To talk about the plan.

462
00:47:40,357 --> 00:47:41,984
Plan?. What plan?.

463
00:47:42,526 --> 00:47:46,053
To ride against Menchaca.
Same plan they told you.

464
00:47:46,230 --> 00:47:50,496
Menchaca?. Nobody told me nothing
about fighting Menchaca.

465
00:47:51,435 --> 00:47:54,871
-This was your idea, Highsmith?.
-lt is.

466
00:47:55,505 --> 00:47:57,530
And you'd do well to join us.

467
00:47:57,975 --> 00:48:01,240
If not for the Menchacas,
your son would be alive.

468
00:48:01,411 --> 00:48:03,743
I know why my son is dead.

469
00:48:03,947 --> 00:48:08,941
And you know I gave an oath to Sam
Houston to not touch Menchaca's land.

470
00:48:09,119 --> 00:48:14,113
You came into my house and lied?.
I'm not gonna tolerate that.

471
00:48:14,291 --> 00:48:17,419
But you'll tolerate
Menchaca right there.

472
00:48:17,794 --> 00:48:22,458
A land that ought to belong to Texas!
Ought to belong to us!

473
00:48:22,633 --> 00:48:25,966
Can't you see?.
This is our chance.

474
00:48:26,136 --> 00:48:30,129
Any man that doesn't take
his chance is a coward.

475
00:48:31,742 --> 00:48:36,873
You call me a coward, sir?. By God,
I saw your courage at San Jacinto.

476
00:48:37,047 --> 00:48:40,574
Shooting down Mexicans
that was trying to surrender.

477
00:48:40,751 --> 00:48:45,085
Any man that talks to me like that,
I'll tickle his ribs.

478
00:48:45,656 --> 00:48:48,386
You'd be with us,
if you had any sand left.

479
00:48:48,558 --> 00:48:50,287
-Why, you--
-Daddy.

480
00:48:52,829 --> 00:48:56,925
Get your horse, Rebecca.
You're coming with me.

481
00:48:57,134 --> 00:49:02,766
I should have never let you marry a man
with such viciousness and treachery.

482
00:49:02,973 --> 00:49:05,771
I'm taking you away from him.

483
00:49:12,783 --> 00:49:16,810
-I ain't going.
-You ain't going?. Why?.

484
00:49:20,724 --> 00:49:26,629
-He's my husband.
-Child, he ain't fit to be your husband.

485
00:49:26,797 --> 00:49:29,960
I know I ain't always
been a proper father.

486
00:49:30,167 --> 00:49:32,965
But I loved you the best
of my daughters.

487
00:49:33,136 --> 00:49:38,540
-No, you didn't.
-The hell, you say. I know my heart!

488
00:49:39,343 --> 00:49:42,540
Oh, you were always
my favorite, Rebecca.

489
00:49:42,713 --> 00:49:46,615
Come on. It's just gonna be you
and me from now on.

490
00:49:54,658 --> 00:49:57,752
Don't you defy me, child!

491
00:49:57,961 --> 00:50:00,828
I'm staying with my husband.

492
00:50:09,339 --> 00:50:12,467
Fine. You stay.

493
00:50:14,077 --> 00:50:17,740
You stay with that fine man.

494
00:50:17,948 --> 00:50:20,246
-You're well-suited.
-Daddy.

495
00:50:20,817 --> 00:50:22,250
Get on!

496
00:50:25,055 --> 00:50:27,148
You're no part of me anyway...

497
00:50:27,324 --> 00:50:31,021
...except as a disease or sickness
in my body is part of me.

498
00:50:31,194 --> 00:50:32,320
Please stop it.

499
00:50:32,496 --> 00:50:36,193
You're my enemy, just as
your sisters are my enemy.

500
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:38,834
You have your fight with Menchaca.

501
00:50:39,336 --> 00:50:41,861
But when you scream for your daddy...

502
00:50:42,072 --> 00:50:46,441
...when those vaqueros have you
on your back, knives at your throat...

503
00:50:46,610 --> 00:50:50,876
...when you're screaming
for John Lear, I won't hear you.

504
00:50:51,048 --> 00:50:55,314
I'll be deaf to your cries.
So I bid you all good day.

505
00:50:55,485 --> 00:50:58,283
May you all burn in hell.

506
00:51:03,193 --> 00:51:05,354
Daddy.

507
00:51:09,933 --> 00:51:12,629
You're a fool, Highsmith.

508
00:51:13,070 --> 00:51:15,038
You'll see who's the fool.

509
00:51:20,477 --> 00:51:22,502
Come, Rebecca.

510
00:51:23,013 --> 00:51:24,173
Come.

511
00:51:24,347 --> 00:51:25,609
Rip!

512
00:51:26,516 --> 00:51:30,282
Where are you going?.
You turning away from me too?.

513
00:51:30,487 --> 00:51:34,753
Is it true what they say?.
They fixing to raid Menchaca?.

514
00:51:35,192 --> 00:51:37,717
That's true, Rip.

515
00:51:40,864 --> 00:51:43,765
Then Miss Claudia in danger.

516
00:51:44,067 --> 00:51:46,661
-Claudia's at Menchaca's?.
-That she is.

517
00:51:46,837 --> 00:51:48,065
How do you know?.

518
00:51:48,238 --> 00:51:52,072
I'm just accustomed
to seeing things with my eyes.

519
00:51:52,275 --> 00:51:54,835
Somebody got to warn her.

520
00:52:07,657 --> 00:52:12,993
Do you remember that terrible storm
when we were children?.

521
00:52:13,396 --> 00:52:19,198
Your father and my father went to the
campo to keep the cattle from drowning.

522
00:52:19,369 --> 00:52:20,529
I remember.

523
00:52:20,704 --> 00:52:24,834
My grandmother was sick
and your mother came with medicine.

524
00:52:25,175 --> 00:52:27,473
That was the first time I saw you.

525
00:52:39,923 --> 00:52:41,185
I'm alone.

526
00:52:49,466 --> 00:52:53,630
Westover, what is so important
you would risk coming here?.

527
00:52:53,803 --> 00:52:55,202
Where's Miss Claudia?.

528
00:52:55,372 --> 00:52:57,863
-Claudia's not here.
-I know she is.

529
00:52:58,408 --> 00:53:02,276
Well, you need not worry.
If she were here, she'd be safe.

530
00:53:02,445 --> 00:53:06,313
-I don't think she would be.
-Why not?.

531
00:53:06,883 --> 00:53:09,681
God forgive me for saying this.

532
00:53:12,489 --> 00:53:14,582
There's a plan.

533
00:53:15,892 --> 00:53:18,759
They're coming to take your land.

534
00:53:20,063 --> 00:53:22,725
I don't remember a time
without a plan.

535
00:53:22,933 --> 00:53:27,097
But this time it's gonna happen.
Highsmith's gathering men.

536
00:53:27,270 --> 00:53:30,671
No. Lear would not be doing this.

537
00:53:30,840 --> 00:53:34,332
He's capable of many things,
but he never break his word.

538
00:53:34,511 --> 00:53:37,344
Lear's not in charge.
He's been turned out.

539
00:53:37,514 --> 00:53:40,347
-Who turned him out?.
-The other daughters.

540
00:53:40,951 --> 00:53:44,717
He ain't got no home to go to anymore.

541
00:53:44,888 --> 00:53:48,949
You've got to find him, Mr. Henry,
and bring him to me.

542
00:53:49,759 --> 00:53:51,056
Miss Claudia.

543
00:53:52,362 --> 00:53:55,525
Find my father, Mr. Henry. Please.

544
00:53:55,732 --> 00:53:59,566
He'll listen to you.
He's always respected you.

545
00:53:59,736 --> 00:54:02,603
Bring him back to me, please.

546
00:54:11,848 --> 00:54:16,581
Come on, over here!
It's coming right down on us.

547
00:54:16,786 --> 00:54:18,310
Let it come.

548
00:54:19,923 --> 00:54:25,020
So you've riled yourself up
against me too, have you?.

549
00:54:25,228 --> 00:54:27,628
You think I'm old!

550
00:54:28,565 --> 00:54:34,003
You think I'm weak!
Just like my daughters!

551
00:54:34,804 --> 00:54:36,863
You see?.

552
00:54:37,073 --> 00:54:42,477
You missed me! I'm still here!
I'm still my god in my saddle!

553
00:54:42,646 --> 00:54:46,514
-You want to get yourself killed?.
-I don't give a damn!

554
00:55:06,836 --> 00:55:08,303
Blow!

555
00:55:08,705 --> 00:55:11,799
You bastard wind, blow!

556
00:55:12,008 --> 00:55:14,101
I'm right here!

557
00:55:15,278 --> 00:55:16,973
Come and get me!

558
00:55:18,214 --> 00:55:19,476
Don't be afraid!

559
00:55:20,450 --> 00:55:24,784
There ain't nothing standing
in your way but me!

560
00:55:25,655 --> 00:55:30,217
Get me! Right down here.

561
00:55:30,493 --> 00:55:34,156
Come on! Come on!

562
00:56:04,394 --> 00:56:06,419
Lear!

563
00:56:08,031 --> 00:56:09,862
Lear!

564
00:56:10,667 --> 00:56:13,329
Somebody calling.

565
00:56:18,074 --> 00:56:24,138
Oh, yes. There's somebody calling.

566
00:56:29,853 --> 00:56:32,583
There must have been a storm.

567
00:56:32,789 --> 00:56:35,815
There's a fresh smell in the air.

568
00:56:37,927 --> 00:56:40,259
Look at that sky.

569
00:56:40,830 --> 00:56:44,288
You ever see a sky so blue?.

570
00:56:50,907 --> 00:56:52,932
John!

571
00:57:17,867 --> 00:57:19,630
John?.

572
00:57:21,037 --> 00:57:22,800
John.

573
00:57:23,006 --> 00:57:25,600
I heard somebody calling.
Was that you?.

574
00:57:26,109 --> 00:57:28,077
It was me.

575
00:57:28,244 --> 00:57:30,508
I don't think I know you.

576
00:57:30,680 --> 00:57:33,774
I used to know everybody
in this country...

577
00:57:33,983 --> 00:57:36,781
...but there are so damn
many of them now.

578
00:57:36,986 --> 00:57:40,478
It's Henry. Henry Westover.

579
00:57:49,899 --> 00:57:52,493
I'm your friend.

580
00:57:52,669 --> 00:57:56,070
I thank you, friend. Sit down.

581
00:58:03,613 --> 00:58:06,878
You got children, mister?.

582
00:58:07,083 --> 00:58:12,248
-Two boys. You know them.
-I do?.

583
00:58:16,092 --> 00:58:21,052
I had a son of my own once, I believe.

584
00:58:21,264 --> 00:58:23,732
I can't quite recall.

585
00:58:26,269 --> 00:58:29,432
Well, I got daughters.

586
00:58:30,373 --> 00:58:32,534
Three of them.

587
00:58:34,310 --> 00:58:36,710
They make a man proud...

588
00:58:36,913 --> 00:58:43,045
...the way they look at you
with their eyes full of love.

589
00:58:43,253 --> 00:58:47,917
Just shining with love
for their father.

590
00:58:49,192 --> 00:58:53,356
There ain't no better feeling
in this world, is there, mister...

591
00:58:53,530 --> 00:58:56,761
...than to know you done right
by your children?.

592
00:58:58,334 --> 00:59:02,964
No, John, no better feeling.

593
00:59:09,412 --> 00:59:12,540
Why are you crying, mister?.

594
00:59:14,017 --> 00:59:19,956
-Come on, I wanna take you home.
-Oh, no. I don't need to go anywhere.

595
00:59:20,423 --> 00:59:25,326
This is my home,
right here where I sit.

596
00:59:28,264 --> 00:59:31,028
Hey, you see him?.

597
00:59:36,739 --> 00:59:42,905
By God, I'm right up there with him.

598
00:59:43,112 --> 00:59:46,570
I feel everything he feels.

599
00:59:46,783 --> 00:59:50,150
I'm looking down
on everything that he sees.

600
00:59:50,820 --> 00:59:56,986
I'm right up there with him,
sailing in the wind.

601
00:59:57,927 --> 01:00:02,728
Come on, to the place!
The place where he's going!

602
01:00:02,899 --> 01:00:06,130
Come on!
Don't you wanna see it, that place?.

603
01:00:06,302 --> 01:00:09,499
The place where he's going?. Come on.

604
01:00:10,773 --> 01:00:12,206
Where'd he go?.

605
01:00:13,843 --> 01:00:16,073
Come on, God, where'd he go?.

606
01:00:16,245 --> 01:00:20,409
Oh, no. No, no, no.

607
01:00:21,985 --> 01:00:26,479
Don't you turn your back on me!
Come back!

608
01:00:27,156 --> 01:00:30,853
Don't you turn away from me!

609
01:00:42,038 --> 01:00:43,938
Emmett!

610
01:01:21,511 --> 01:01:25,072
-Mr. Westover.
-What do you want, Highsmith?.

611
01:01:25,281 --> 01:01:27,875
I wanna know where you've been.

612
01:01:29,886 --> 01:01:32,946
How do you know
that I've been anywheres?.

613
01:01:36,225 --> 01:01:37,920
Did Emmett tell you?.

614
01:01:45,334 --> 01:01:50,294
Now, Mr. Westover,
we'll see who's the fool.

615
01:01:50,506 --> 01:01:52,303
Help him.

616
01:01:57,947 --> 01:02:02,577
-Where were you?. Who did you talk to?.
-Go to hell.

617
01:02:05,555 --> 01:02:12,051
-Where were you?. Who did you talk to?.
-You're wasting your time.

618
01:02:19,635 --> 01:02:21,933
We're gonna have to move fast.

619
01:02:22,138 --> 01:02:25,596
Gather whatever men you can
and meet at my house.

620
01:02:25,808 --> 01:02:30,472
-How do you know they'll follow me?.
-I'll pay them.

621
01:02:31,647 --> 01:02:37,017
I don't know what you want out of life,
but I suspect it's something big.

622
01:02:37,220 --> 01:02:40,485
You don't aspire to small things,
do you?.

623
01:02:40,690 --> 01:02:43,921
Small never appealed to me.

624
01:02:44,961 --> 01:02:48,226
It was just the only thing
ever offered.

625
01:02:48,765 --> 01:02:53,202
A man wants something big,
he's gotta go out and get it.

626
01:03:12,622 --> 01:03:15,455
Smithwick! Davis!

627
01:03:21,397 --> 01:03:23,524
Bring him over here.

628
01:03:31,507 --> 01:03:36,877
Now, hold him tight.
Hold him steady, now. Hold him.

629
01:03:42,385 --> 01:03:44,046
Hold him, damn it!

630
01:03:44,253 --> 01:03:48,349
-No, I won't do that.
-Get back here!

631
01:03:48,558 --> 01:03:50,992
-Get back here.
-I won't do that.

632
01:03:51,194 --> 01:03:55,927
-Get back here, damn it! Hold him!
-I got him.

633
01:03:56,899 --> 01:03:59,265
-Hold him.
-I got him.

634
01:04:09,078 --> 01:04:13,037
You got one eye left and you don't
want me to burn that out.

635
01:04:13,249 --> 01:04:15,046
Tell me where you--

636
01:04:19,555 --> 01:04:25,721
-You shot me, you son of a bitch.
-Yes, sir, I did.

637
01:04:34,637 --> 01:04:38,869
-Are you planning to interfere?.
-No, ma'am.

638
01:04:50,419 --> 01:04:53,320
He's dead, Rebecca.

639
01:04:55,358 --> 01:04:59,124
-He's dead.
-You'll burn in hell.

640
01:05:14,377 --> 01:05:16,607
Hold him down.

641
01:05:49,512 --> 01:05:52,640
You know me, don't you?.

642
01:05:59,121 --> 01:06:02,750
Are we dead, you and me?.

643
01:06:03,993 --> 01:06:06,894
We're not dead, Pa.

644
01:06:09,031 --> 01:06:10,692
Pa?.

645
01:06:14,537 --> 01:06:17,404
I should know you.

646
01:06:23,779 --> 01:06:28,876
Please don't laugh.
I think you're my daughter.

647
01:06:30,386 --> 01:06:32,479
Claudia?.

648
01:06:33,923 --> 01:06:36,221
Yes, it's me.

649
01:06:40,429 --> 01:06:46,664
I see you now. I see you clear enough.

650
01:06:48,037 --> 01:06:50,938
Oh, how you must hate me, child.

651
01:06:51,140 --> 01:06:55,634
No. No, I love you.

652
01:06:55,845 --> 01:06:57,870
I love you.

653
01:07:21,604 --> 01:07:23,663
-Where am l?.
-Senor Lear.

654
01:07:28,044 --> 01:07:30,012
It's all right, Pa.

655
01:07:30,179 --> 01:07:33,910
How do you mean?.
What am I doing in his house?.

656
01:07:34,116 --> 01:07:38,075
He helped rescue you.
And he's been protecting me.

657
01:07:38,287 --> 01:07:41,882
The hell you say.
He's the enemy of our blood.

658
01:07:42,091 --> 01:07:44,423
What the hell is going on?.

659
01:07:44,960 --> 01:07:48,452
Senor, we are expecting an attack.

660
01:07:48,664 --> 01:07:51,258
An attack?. Who from?.

661
01:07:58,674 --> 01:08:03,611
Highsmith and my two other daughters.

662
01:08:05,381 --> 01:08:08,179
Sir, forgive our accommodations...

663
01:08:08,350 --> 01:08:12,912
... but this is the safest place
in the hacienda. Stay here.

664
01:08:15,991 --> 01:08:17,959
Senor.

665
01:08:19,328 --> 01:08:21,091
I'll stand with you.

666
01:08:21,297 --> 01:08:27,031
No, no, no. Stay with your daughter.
You belong with her now.

667
01:09:09,345 --> 01:09:12,473
You men, help them finish
loading that wagon.

668
01:09:12,648 --> 01:09:16,209
Hope your canteens are full.
It is hotter than hell.

669
01:09:19,054 --> 01:09:21,181
-Bring it up.
-There we go.

670
01:09:28,130 --> 01:09:30,564
Captain Tumlinson's due back any day.

671
01:09:31,133 --> 01:09:34,000
Don't concern yourself
with my husband.

672
01:09:34,203 --> 01:09:38,139
When you get back,
we'll take care of that together.

673
01:09:42,478 --> 01:09:45,675
Her husband ain't even
been dead a week.

674
01:09:45,881 --> 01:09:48,679
Funny how some people
are cold-hearted.

675
01:09:56,258 --> 01:09:58,419
All right, mount up.

676
01:09:58,627 --> 01:10:00,720
Let's go.

677
01:10:22,818 --> 01:10:27,187
What are we doing, Suzannah?.
What has become of us?.

678
01:10:27,389 --> 01:10:32,088
Don't be softhearted, Rebecca.
Not now.

679
01:11:17,006 --> 01:11:19,167
Anybody there?.

680
01:11:57,379 --> 01:11:59,142
No!

681
01:12:01,417 --> 01:12:03,647
-No, Pa.
-Leave me alone.

682
01:12:03,852 --> 01:12:08,186
Pa, it's me. It's Thomas.
It's Thomas, Pa.

683
01:12:08,390 --> 01:12:10,381
Come on now, Pa.

684
01:12:21,804 --> 01:12:23,863
Thomas.

685
01:12:36,352 --> 01:12:39,048
You've come back.

686
01:12:41,023 --> 01:12:43,048
You're back.

687
01:12:43,826 --> 01:12:46,420
You're back.

688
01:12:51,567 --> 01:12:56,732
How could I ever thought
you stole those horses?.

689
01:12:57,740 --> 01:13:00,368
Why would Emmett do such a thing?.

690
01:13:00,542 --> 01:13:04,308
So he could take
what was rightfully yours.

691
01:13:04,780 --> 01:13:07,806
That's not enough for him anymore.

692
01:13:08,016 --> 01:13:10,109
What do you mean?.

693
01:13:10,319 --> 01:13:14,346
I know he sent Highsmith that day.

694
01:13:14,523 --> 01:13:18,425
He knew what he would do.
He knew well enough.

695
01:13:18,627 --> 01:13:23,621
-Don't say that. I won't believe it.
-lt was Emmett, son.

696
01:13:30,005 --> 01:13:32,906
-Then I'll kill him.
-No.

697
01:13:33,075 --> 01:13:38,945
I was blind before. I couldn't see
the hate in Emmett's heart.

698
01:13:39,548 --> 01:13:42,244
But you, you....

699
01:13:44,620 --> 01:13:47,487
Will you forgive me?.

700
01:14:01,470 --> 01:14:04,633
Hello, Enrique. Good to see you.

701
01:14:15,017 --> 01:14:18,418
Suzannah. Suzannah.

702
01:14:19,955 --> 01:14:21,616
Rebecca.

703
01:14:23,459 --> 01:14:27,259
-You're back early.
-Yes. Where are all the men?.

704
01:14:27,463 --> 01:14:32,400
-Out on the campo.
-Doing what?. Roundup's over, isn't it?.

705
01:14:32,601 --> 01:14:37,800
There was a storm. Cattle scattered
before the men could bring them in.

706
01:14:38,006 --> 01:14:40,406
Where's your husband?.

707
01:14:40,609 --> 01:14:45,171
He was murdered.
Murdered by one of the hands.

708
01:14:45,781 --> 01:14:51,720
We had his funeral two days ago.
I can show you his grave, Henry.

709
01:14:57,726 --> 01:14:59,387
I want to speak to Lear.

710
01:14:59,561 --> 01:15:03,622
We don't know where he is.
He disappeared.

711
01:15:04,566 --> 01:15:08,662
Then why are you sitting here?.
Why aren't you looking for him?.

712
01:15:16,211 --> 01:15:18,839
It's Menchaca's, isn't it?.

713
01:15:21,517 --> 01:15:26,784
You're too late.
You're too late to stop it, Henry.

714
01:15:26,989 --> 01:15:30,789
But you're not too late
to share in its success.

715
01:15:30,993 --> 01:15:33,962
Don't try to stand in our way.

716
01:15:55,183 --> 01:15:56,616
Go.

717
01:16:06,728 --> 01:16:11,665
Don't be afraid.
You're with your father.

718
01:16:19,541 --> 01:16:22,669
Rip?. Rip, I say.

719
01:16:26,315 --> 01:16:28,283
Bring me a damn rifle.

720
01:16:31,720 --> 01:16:35,747
Rip?. Rip, come back here.

721
01:16:35,958 --> 01:16:38,620
Come back here, damn you!

722
01:16:40,796 --> 01:16:46,564
What you want now?. Want your horse
so you can ride after another storm?.

723
01:16:46,768 --> 01:16:50,101
No, I wanna say something.

724
01:16:50,305 --> 01:16:55,242
Well, go on. Go on and say it.
And quit staring at me like that.

725
01:16:55,410 --> 01:17:00,177
You look like you're about to squirt
blood out of your eyes like a toad.

726
01:17:00,515 --> 01:17:03,143
What you got to say?.

727
01:17:05,354 --> 01:17:08,016
Thank you, Rip.

728
01:17:17,566 --> 01:17:19,727
You ain't welcome.

729
01:17:46,328 --> 01:17:50,025
He must have got word that
we was coming and skedaddled.

730
01:17:50,866 --> 01:17:53,198
They did.

731
01:17:53,402 --> 01:17:57,634
I thought Menchaca had
more fight in him than that.

732
01:18:00,909 --> 01:18:04,310
What are we waiting for?.
There ain't nobody there.

733
01:18:06,948 --> 01:18:11,885
You take 1 0 men,
you go scout inside. You 1 0!

734
01:20:16,745 --> 01:20:18,542
Ambush!

735
01:20:31,459 --> 01:20:35,418
Put down your weapons
and you will live.

736
01:20:46,808 --> 01:20:49,470
Put them down!

737
01:20:49,911 --> 01:20:51,970
To hell with you!

738
01:20:59,287 --> 01:21:01,050
Bust those gates open, now!

739
01:21:01,256 --> 01:21:02,848
Fire.

740
01:21:07,128 --> 01:21:08,720
Fire.

741
01:21:14,369 --> 01:21:17,702
Look like the damn Alamo
all over again.

742
01:21:20,609 --> 01:21:24,136
Through the gates! Through the gates!

743
01:21:40,629 --> 01:21:43,063
Get those gates open, now!

744
01:21:59,881 --> 01:22:02,042
Move it. Let's go!

745
01:22:19,834 --> 01:22:22,496
Fall back!

746
01:22:55,503 --> 01:22:57,994
Where's your father?.

747
01:23:40,015 --> 01:23:42,279
No!

748
01:23:42,484 --> 01:23:44,679
That's enough.

749
01:23:45,687 --> 01:23:48,850
That's enough.
Do you hear me, damn it?.

750
01:23:49,057 --> 01:23:50,718
Pa!

751
01:23:51,493 --> 01:23:54,553
-Stop it! Stop!
-Pa!

752
01:23:56,498 --> 01:23:57,863
No more!

753
01:24:06,374 --> 01:24:09,275
-Hear me--
-Miss Claudia!

754
01:24:45,213 --> 01:24:50,776
Stop! Stop! Hold your fire!

755
01:24:51,653 --> 01:24:53,644
Pull back!

756
01:24:54,823 --> 01:24:56,347
Damn you.

757
01:25:51,412 --> 01:25:53,573
Murderers!

758
01:25:54,549 --> 01:25:59,179
Claudia. Claudia.

759
01:26:03,758 --> 01:26:05,726
Claudia.

760
01:26:11,666 --> 01:26:13,327
Rip.

761
01:26:21,075 --> 01:26:24,067
See?. This feather stirs.

762
01:26:26,214 --> 01:26:30,548
She's breathing! She's alive!

763
01:26:31,986 --> 01:26:34,454
That ain't nothing but the wind.

764
01:26:38,059 --> 01:26:42,086
No, you're wrong, Rip.
I know the difference.

765
01:26:43,464 --> 01:26:46,160
This is her breath.

766
01:26:47,235 --> 01:26:49,533
She's alive.

767
01:26:50,305 --> 01:26:53,934
But she's not, John. She's not.

768
01:27:31,512 --> 01:27:33,275
Look at him.

769
01:27:38,987 --> 01:27:41,182
He's alive.

770
01:27:42,624 --> 01:27:45,320
Not Claudia.

771
01:27:50,198 --> 01:27:52,996
She's dead as the ground.

772
01:27:59,274 --> 01:28:01,538
Look there.

773
01:28:03,444 --> 01:28:05,912
Look there.

774
01:29:51,018 --> 01:29:53,486
You did this.

775
01:29:56,324 --> 01:29:58,724
It needed doing.

776
01:30:02,430 --> 01:30:04,830
Where's Emmett?.

777
01:30:35,029 --> 01:30:37,054
Rebecca...

778
01:30:39,066 --> 01:30:41,534
...show some pride.

779
01:30:42,870 --> 01:30:48,433
I'll see you hang for this,
and what you did to Westover.

780
01:30:50,011 --> 01:30:52,036
Will you?.

781
01:31:06,761 --> 01:31:09,525
No. Leave her.

782
01:31:24,278 --> 01:31:26,371
Suzannah!

783
01:31:34,088 --> 01:31:36,283
Suzannah!

784
01:31:38,326 --> 01:31:40,521
Where's she going?.

785
01:31:44,398 --> 01:31:47,799
Somebody tell me where she's going!

786
01:31:52,106 --> 01:31:55,200
Don't touch me.
Where are you taking me?.

787
01:31:55,409 --> 01:31:59,072
Mr. Tumlinson,
where are they taking me?.

788
01:32:52,199 --> 01:32:54,190
You hear that?.

789
01:32:54,902 --> 01:32:56,767
What is it?.

790
01:32:57,338 --> 01:32:59,829
It's that mountain lion.

791
01:33:00,074 --> 01:33:04,738
-There ain't no mountain lion.
-Damn it, I heared it, didn't l?.

792
01:33:05,846 --> 01:33:08,906
He's out there waiting
for us to go to bed...

793
01:33:09,083 --> 01:33:12,541
...so he can come here
and kill one of our horses.

794
01:33:12,753 --> 01:33:16,689
-He ain't gonna kill our horses.
-How do you know that?.

795
01:33:16,891 --> 01:33:21,157
Because I'm out here,
and I'll be keeping watch, Pa.

796
01:33:22,563 --> 01:33:25,054
I expect you will.

797
01:33:28,936 --> 01:33:31,734
I know you will, Thomas.
