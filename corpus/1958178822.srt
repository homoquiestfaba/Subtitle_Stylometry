1
00:00:18,673 --> 00:00:22,815
One of the big benefits
of living in this block

2
00:00:22,919 --> 00:00:25,370
is having classical music

3
00:00:25,473 --> 00:00:29,374
beautifully played morning and afternoon.

4
00:00:29,477 --> 00:00:33,895
In fact, I know people
who have been used to

5
00:00:33,999 --> 00:00:39,556
standing outside the building
in the street listening to her

6
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:41,869
and just admiring her playing,

7
00:00:41,972 --> 00:00:46,356
and she still plays, every day.

8
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:48,718
To the residents of
this small apartment building

9
00:00:48,738 --> 00:00:50,326
in North London,

10
00:00:50,429 --> 00:00:53,225
Alice Sommer is the Lady in Number 6.

11
00:00:58,817 --> 00:01:01,406
My world is music.

12
00:01:01,509 --> 00:01:04,650
I am not interested in anything else.

13
00:01:18,216 --> 00:01:20,459
Alice lives alone.

14
00:01:20,563 --> 00:01:23,911
She still has her health, and at 109,

15
00:01:24,014 --> 00:01:27,017
she feels
she's the luckiest person alive.

16
00:01:27,121 --> 00:01:29,503
Alice receives visitors
every afternoon...

17
00:01:29,606 --> 00:01:33,334
I always thought this was
a silly person, a dope.

18
00:01:33,438 --> 00:01:35,578
...friends who come to hear
her stories

19
00:01:35,681 --> 00:01:37,787
and maybe learn from her experience.

20
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:41,584
I love people.
I love everyone.

21
00:01:41,687 --> 00:01:43,033
I love people.

22
00:01:43,137 --> 00:01:45,484
I love to speak with them.

23
00:01:45,588 --> 00:01:48,453
I'm interested in the life
of other people.

24
00:01:55,598 --> 00:01:58,980
Mostly I start to play,
it's 10:00.

25
00:01:59,084 --> 00:02:03,813
And when the people in the house
listen to my playing,

26
00:02:03,916 --> 00:02:06,609
"I know it's 10:00.
She plays."

27
00:02:12,649 --> 00:02:14,410
This is Bach.

28
00:02:14,513 --> 00:02:18,483
I am full of joy.

29
00:02:18,586 --> 00:02:20,243
In my house, for instance,

30
00:02:20,347 --> 00:02:22,728
when I go with this,

31
00:02:22,832 --> 00:02:25,490
I go as an invalid.

32
00:02:25,593 --> 00:02:27,975
I am the only one who is laughing.

33
00:02:28,078 --> 00:02:30,702
Nobody laughs here in this house.

34
00:02:34,913 --> 00:02:39,366
Alice was born in Prague in 1903.

35
00:02:39,469 --> 00:02:41,437
She grew up amongst many of the foremost

36
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:43,508
creative minds of the day.

37
00:02:45,337 --> 00:02:48,961
Mahler and Kafka were family friends.

38
00:02:49,065 --> 00:02:51,481
When I was 10 years old,

39
00:02:51,585 --> 00:02:54,691
my mother took me to a concert,

40
00:02:54,795 --> 00:02:59,903
the first performance of
the second symphony of Mahler.

41
00:03:00,007 --> 00:03:02,596
It was in Vienna.

42
00:03:02,699 --> 00:03:05,323
And Mahler was sitting there,

43
00:03:05,426 --> 00:03:09,258
and my mother went to him,
and they spoke together.

44
00:03:09,361 --> 00:03:13,296
So I spoke, actually,
a little bit with Gustav Mahler.

45
00:03:15,402 --> 00:03:18,094
As a young girl,
she'd be asked to play the piano

46
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:23,617
for famous artists who'd stop by
to visit her parents.

47
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:27,862
Franz Kafka...
He was a friend of my mother,

48
00:03:27,966 --> 00:03:29,485
I can say.

49
00:03:29,588 --> 00:03:33,282
She speaks...
She spoke with him for hours,

50
00:03:33,385 --> 00:03:39,529
asking him what he's writing,
what he's loving, or...

51
00:03:39,633 --> 00:03:42,394
He was our friend.

52
00:03:42,498 --> 00:03:46,191
And sometimes he took myself
and my twin sister,

53
00:03:46,295 --> 00:03:48,642
and we went for walks.

54
00:03:48,745 --> 00:03:51,645
He told us stories which I'd forgot,

55
00:03:51,748 --> 00:03:56,408
but I remember the atmosphere.

56
00:03:56,512 --> 00:03:58,893
Made a deep impression.

57
00:04:01,793 --> 00:04:07,177
My opinion is what we learn in school...

58
00:04:07,281 --> 00:04:12,182
It is important, but much more important

59
00:04:12,286 --> 00:04:17,671
is the atmosphere,
intellectual atmosphere,

60
00:04:17,774 --> 00:04:22,262
of your parents in your home.

61
00:04:22,365 --> 00:04:26,058
This goes with you till you end.

62
00:04:31,374 --> 00:04:36,759
Beethoven... he is a miracle.

63
00:04:39,624 --> 00:04:43,110
His music is not only melody.

64
00:04:43,213 --> 00:04:46,078
What is inside...

65
00:04:46,182 --> 00:04:49,289
what is inside, how it's felt...

66
00:04:49,392 --> 00:04:53,534
It's full, it is intensive.

67
00:05:04,096 --> 00:05:07,617
Phenomenal.

68
00:05:07,721 --> 00:05:10,758
Inspired by her musical heroes,

69
00:05:10,862 --> 00:05:13,554
Alice decided on a concert career.

70
00:05:13,658 --> 00:05:17,593
She sought out the legendary
pianist Artur Schnabel.

71
00:05:17,696 --> 00:05:19,526
Had she made the right choice?

72
00:05:19,629 --> 00:05:24,807
I wanted to know his opinion
about my level.

73
00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:27,223
And I played to him, and he said,

74
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:29,536
"You can't learn with me.

75
00:05:29,639 --> 00:05:32,159
You can't learn anything else."

76
00:05:33,781 --> 00:05:35,645
Alice's life became a whirlwind

77
00:05:35,749 --> 00:05:38,303
of rehearsals and concerts.

78
00:05:38,407 --> 00:05:42,031
Then one day, a particular
violinist caught her eye.

79
00:05:44,930 --> 00:05:48,071
Leopold.

80
00:05:48,175 --> 00:05:50,591
We called him "Bootsie."

81
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:55,596
He was an extraordinary violinist,

82
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:59,566
and he knew languages perfect,

83
00:05:59,669 --> 00:06:03,363
and everything he knew.

84
00:06:03,466 --> 00:06:06,607
I was in love with his knowledge.

85
00:06:06,711 --> 00:06:10,024
We married in '37.

86
00:06:10,128 --> 00:06:14,028
And I told to my husband,

87
00:06:14,132 --> 00:06:17,653
"Now we are married"... in the
evening when we came home...

88
00:06:17,756 --> 00:06:19,068
"Now we are married."

89
00:06:19,171 --> 00:06:23,728
In the moment when you will find
another woman

90
00:06:23,831 --> 00:06:28,318
who is... who you like more, you can...

91
00:06:28,422 --> 00:06:31,736
We stay friends.

92
00:06:31,839 --> 00:06:33,669
It's okay.

93
00:06:33,772 --> 00:06:35,981
There are thousands and thousands

94
00:06:36,085 --> 00:06:39,468
of beautiful women in the world.

95
00:06:39,571 --> 00:06:45,405
I will be very sad, of course,
but you can do it."

96
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:49,478
It was 1937,

97
00:06:49,581 --> 00:06:52,481
and these were
the best of times for Alice.

98
00:06:52,584 --> 00:06:54,379
She married the man she loved,

99
00:06:54,483 --> 00:06:56,692
she was becoming a musical celebrity,

100
00:06:56,795 --> 00:07:00,281
and with the birth of her son,
she had it all.

101
00:07:03,871 --> 00:07:09,359
My son, Raphael...
He was maybe 3 years old,

102
00:07:09,463 --> 00:07:13,225
not yet, sitting the whole day.

103
00:07:13,329 --> 00:07:17,437
He loved in this time was gramophone,

104
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:23,788
and suddenly it comes
to an enormous fortissimo.

105
00:07:28,068 --> 00:07:32,141
And the boy... he was 3 years old...

106
00:07:32,244 --> 00:07:35,385
Started to cry.

107
00:07:35,489 --> 00:07:38,354
And I asked, "Why do you cry?"

108
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:40,701
"The music is so beautiful."

109
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:46,155
Ah, it's... ah.

110
00:08:30,199 --> 00:08:33,167
With music, I was always happy.

111
00:08:33,271 --> 00:08:35,860
I am happy even without music.

112
00:08:35,963 --> 00:08:39,726
Even thinking of music make me happy.

113
00:08:43,695 --> 00:08:47,285
One of the greatest philosophers said,

114
00:08:47,388 --> 00:08:51,703
"Music is in the first place
of art."

115
00:08:55,707 --> 00:08:59,228
It brings us on an island

116
00:08:59,331 --> 00:09:03,888
with peace, beauty and love.

117
00:09:17,142 --> 00:09:19,317
Music is... is a dream.

118
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:22,527
Music is a dream!

119
00:09:41,097 --> 00:09:43,375
Alice had been living her dream

120
00:09:43,479 --> 00:09:47,379
until it came time
for everyone's dreams to end.

121
00:09:47,483 --> 00:09:50,382
Here is my best friend,

122
00:09:50,486 --> 00:09:54,076
born, as well, in Prague

123
00:09:54,179 --> 00:09:57,631
and brought up in Prague and so on.

124
00:09:57,735 --> 00:10:01,497
Let her speak about it.

125
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:04,880
The day was 15th of March, 1939.

126
00:10:04,983 --> 00:10:06,502
It was a Wednesday.

127
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:09,712
My father was calling us...
We were three children...

128
00:10:09,816 --> 00:10:12,542
About 6:00 in the morning
in excited voice,

129
00:10:12,646 --> 00:10:14,165
which was rare for him.

130
00:10:14,268 --> 00:10:17,375
"Come children. Come, come
quickly to the window."

131
00:10:17,478 --> 00:10:20,723
It was like an earthquake.

132
00:10:20,827 --> 00:10:24,520
Thousands of German motorcycles,

133
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:26,591
these iron helmets,

134
00:10:26,695 --> 00:10:30,595
rumbled through for hours.

135
00:10:30,699 --> 00:10:35,807
But soon after we realized
Czechoslovakia was taken over,

136
00:10:35,911 --> 00:10:43,297
and Nuremberg Laws started to be
implemented against the Jews.

137
00:10:43,401 --> 00:10:48,337
My father had to sign off
his whole business

138
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:51,892
that he's giving it away
out of free will.

139
00:10:51,996 --> 00:10:55,931
The radios have been confiscated.

140
00:10:56,034 --> 00:11:00,142
Domestic animals have been
confiscated... my dog.

141
00:11:00,245 --> 00:11:01,769
How do you explain it to the dog

142
00:11:01,868 --> 00:11:05,009
there is a German invasion,
and he has to go with them

143
00:11:05,112 --> 00:11:06,631
and can't stay at home?

144
00:11:06,735 --> 00:11:10,186
You know, these are
the little details in life

145
00:11:10,290 --> 00:11:12,188
that are so difficult.

146
00:11:16,365 --> 00:11:21,094
Every day the Jews of
Prague endured new humiliations.

147
00:11:21,197 --> 00:11:24,028
Even Alice's daily walk
in the park with Rafi

148
00:11:24,131 --> 00:11:26,616
was forbidden.

149
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:30,517
For mothers, was very difficult,
but I played.

150
00:11:32,139 --> 00:11:34,245
Even on pain of death.

151
00:11:36,868 --> 00:11:41,528
To the Nazis, music was a luxury
for non-Jews only.

152
00:11:41,631 --> 00:11:46,464
So Alice's beloved concert grand
had been taken away.

153
00:11:46,567 --> 00:11:49,087
But in an act of quiet resistance,

154
00:11:49,191 --> 00:11:51,883
she hid her tiny piccolo piano.

155
00:11:55,162 --> 00:11:59,132
To Alice, being able to play
meant everything,

156
00:11:59,235 --> 00:12:02,342
even at the risk of betrayal.

157
00:12:02,445 --> 00:12:08,624
In my house, we are
living four Nazi families.

158
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:16,011
I believe my boy was playing
with their boy in the street.

159
00:12:16,114 --> 00:12:18,220
They were good friends.

160
00:12:18,323 --> 00:12:21,706
In any case, I played a lot at this time,

161
00:12:21,810 --> 00:12:25,848
and once, the woman
who take care of our house

162
00:12:25,952 --> 00:12:29,093
came and said to me,
"Mrs. Sommer,

163
00:12:29,196 --> 00:12:32,786
Mr. Hellman"... the name
of this German man...

164
00:12:32,890 --> 00:12:38,240
Ask me suddenly you didn't play... why?

165
00:12:38,343 --> 00:12:44,004
He asked me whether you are
already deportated.

166
00:12:44,108 --> 00:12:50,217
He told me he loved
your playing."

167
00:12:50,321 --> 00:12:53,220
And this time I didn't play,

168
00:12:53,324 --> 00:12:57,500
but when she said he loved it,
I was already sitting.

169
00:12:57,604 --> 00:13:04,162
But before our deportation, he came.

170
00:13:04,266 --> 00:13:07,787
"Frau Sommer, they will send you away.

171
00:13:07,890 --> 00:13:13,413
It's difficult to find
the right words for me.

172
00:13:13,516 --> 00:13:17,969
I was sitting for hours and hours

173
00:13:18,073 --> 00:13:23,216
and listening and enjoyed your playing.

174
00:13:23,319 --> 00:13:27,668
I thank you from the bottom of my heart.

175
00:13:27,772 --> 00:13:33,088
You helped us to get over the hard time

176
00:13:33,191 --> 00:13:38,162
we went through as a German."

177
00:13:38,265 --> 00:13:41,199
While the whole world
went mad around her,

178
00:13:41,303 --> 00:13:45,617
Alice could still see the
humanity in individual Germans,

179
00:13:45,721 --> 00:13:49,138
though she and her people
had become officially

180
00:13:49,242 --> 00:13:51,278
less than human.

181
00:13:51,382 --> 00:13:54,316
One by one, everyone in her life,

182
00:13:54,419 --> 00:13:59,252
every Jew in Prague,
was being taken away.

183
00:13:59,355 --> 00:14:03,877
My father... when
the Gestapo came to arrest him,

184
00:14:03,981 --> 00:14:06,259
he was standing at the door

185
00:14:06,362 --> 00:14:09,779
with his coat, with his hat in his hand,

186
00:14:09,883 --> 00:14:12,161
looked us over... it was dinnertime...

187
00:14:12,265 --> 00:14:14,784
And said only these words.

188
00:14:14,888 --> 00:14:21,584
"Just stay calm.
Remember, calmness is strength."

189
00:14:21,688 --> 00:14:24,656
And they pushed him out,
and that was the end.

190
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:28,350
And this sentence sort of stayed with me,

191
00:14:28,453 --> 00:14:30,317
and it works.

192
00:14:30,421 --> 00:14:33,873
It is true.
Calmness is strength.

193
00:14:33,976 --> 00:14:37,324
My mother was sent away.

194
00:14:37,428 --> 00:14:43,434
And I was till her last moment with her.

195
00:14:43,537 --> 00:14:47,403
Very hard for me, for her.

196
00:14:47,507 --> 00:14:49,854
We didn't know about
where they were sent away.

197
00:14:49,958 --> 00:14:54,617
We didn't know what...
What will happen with them.

198
00:14:54,721 --> 00:14:57,206
It was a hard time.

199
00:15:00,934 --> 00:15:03,178
Despite the freedom Alice gave Leopold

200
00:15:03,281 --> 00:15:06,560
on their wedding night,
he never did leave her,

201
00:15:06,664 --> 00:15:10,530
until the day the Nazis stole him away.

202
00:15:10,633 --> 00:15:13,395
Finally, they came for Alice.

203
00:15:13,498 --> 00:15:17,157
She was 39 when she and her
little boy, Rafi,

204
00:15:17,261 --> 00:15:18,745
arrived in the strangest place

205
00:15:18,848 --> 00:15:21,990
in the entire concentration camp system,

206
00:15:22,093 --> 00:15:26,201
Theresienstadt,
a feed account for Auschwitz

207
00:15:26,304 --> 00:15:28,755
where Jewish celebrities
and intellectuals

208
00:15:28,858 --> 00:15:33,484
were used by the Nazis
for propaganda purposes.

209
00:15:33,587 --> 00:15:36,038
These images were filmed
to show the world

210
00:15:36,142 --> 00:15:40,042
how well the Jews of Europe
were being treated.

211
00:15:40,146 --> 00:15:45,461
Starving prisoners were allowed
to compose and give concerts.

212
00:15:45,565 --> 00:15:49,741
I knew that we will play.

213
00:15:49,845 --> 00:15:51,709
And I was thinking,

214
00:15:51,812 --> 00:15:56,541
when we can play,
it can't be so terrible.

215
00:15:56,645 --> 00:15:58,716
The music, the music!

216
00:16:03,859 --> 00:16:05,550
Ah, here they are.

217
00:16:05,654 --> 00:16:07,414
Ah!
So how is it going?

218
00:16:07,518 --> 00:16:09,244
My Sunday friend.

219
00:16:09,347 --> 00:16:13,041
She comes every Sunday.

220
00:16:13,144 --> 00:16:16,044
Zdenka and Anita stop by regularly

221
00:16:16,147 --> 00:16:18,598
to visit their friend.

222
00:16:18,701 --> 00:16:22,153
A pianist, and actress, and a cellist,

223
00:16:22,257 --> 00:16:24,500
they all survived the camps.

224
00:16:24,604 --> 00:16:28,539
But every day in life is beautiful.

225
00:16:28,642 --> 00:16:30,299
Every day...

226
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:37,272
...that... that we are here,
we can speak about everything.

227
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:39,239
No? It's beautiful.

228
00:16:44,555 --> 00:16:48,490
In Theresienstadt,
Alice played over 100 concerts,

229
00:16:48,593 --> 00:16:53,322
performing all of
Chopin's études from memory.

230
00:16:53,426 --> 00:16:56,946
That was my first time, actually,

231
00:16:57,050 --> 00:17:01,399
I have heard all Chopin's études,

232
00:17:01,503 --> 00:17:04,161
and I remember Alice
sitting on the stage.

233
00:17:04,264 --> 00:17:07,198
I was in about third row

234
00:17:07,302 --> 00:17:09,856
and saw her from the right profile,

235
00:17:09,959 --> 00:17:11,685
and I was quite captivated.

236
00:17:11,789 --> 00:17:17,415
It was magic to hear this music
in that kind of surrounding,

237
00:17:17,519 --> 00:17:22,041
which you don't realize until it's over.

238
00:17:22,144 --> 00:17:26,700
So you come sort of back
to Earth and see where you are

239
00:17:26,804 --> 00:17:30,566
and how much it was a moral support.

240
00:17:30,670 --> 00:17:34,570
It was not entertainment,
as most people think,

241
00:17:34,674 --> 00:17:36,400
that we were having fun.

242
00:17:36,503 --> 00:17:38,333
It had a much bigger value.

243
00:17:57,524 --> 00:18:01,080
I felt that this is the only thing

244
00:18:01,183 --> 00:18:06,395
which helps me to...

245
00:18:06,499 --> 00:18:08,708
to have hope.

246
00:18:08,811 --> 00:18:13,920
It is sort of religion, actually.

247
00:18:14,023 --> 00:18:17,820
Music is...

248
00:18:17,924 --> 00:18:19,788
is God.

249
00:18:24,413 --> 00:18:27,002
In difficult times you feel it,

250
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:31,696
especially when you are suffering.

251
00:18:35,873 --> 00:18:38,358
Alice's faith in music was an inspiration

252
00:18:38,462 --> 00:18:41,223
to her son, Rafi.

253
00:18:41,327 --> 00:18:45,020
He sang in Theresienstadt's
children's opera, "Brundibár."

254
00:18:46,987 --> 00:18:50,336
And sustained by his mother's
natural optimism,

255
00:18:50,439 --> 00:18:53,477
he, too, survived.

256
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:56,100
We are sleeping on a mattress.

257
00:18:56,204 --> 00:18:58,413
He felt my body.

258
00:18:58,516 --> 00:19:03,003
When a child is near to the mother,

259
00:19:03,107 --> 00:19:04,488
everything can happen.

260
00:19:04,591 --> 00:19:06,869
He's not afraid.

261
00:19:06,973 --> 00:19:10,563
It gives him a security.

262
00:19:10,666 --> 00:19:12,323
And I was always laughing.

263
00:19:12,427 --> 00:19:15,223
Even there, I was laughing.

264
00:19:20,089 --> 00:19:22,609
So the people who were
sitting in the audience,

265
00:19:22,713 --> 00:19:24,404
and we on stage...

266
00:19:24,508 --> 00:19:27,787
We were transported
into a different time,

267
00:19:27,890 --> 00:19:33,586
the time before when we lived
in a normal civilized life,

268
00:19:33,689 --> 00:19:35,035
civilized world,

269
00:19:35,139 --> 00:19:37,486
and hoping and being convinced

270
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:39,661
that the war will soon finish,

271
00:19:39,764 --> 00:19:43,389
and we'll go back home and it will go on.

272
00:19:43,492 --> 00:19:46,702
But, of course, what we knew later,

273
00:19:46,806 --> 00:19:48,808
the Germans knew full well

274
00:19:48,911 --> 00:19:52,812
that we are sentenced to death
and thought,

275
00:19:52,915 --> 00:19:55,642
"Let them play.
Let them laugh.

276
00:19:55,746 --> 00:20:00,613
The laughter will soon vanish
from their face."

277
00:20:00,716 --> 00:20:04,789
And we were dancing under the gallows.

278
00:20:08,448 --> 00:20:11,348
They were beautiful moments there.

279
00:20:13,384 --> 00:20:18,286
I knew that even in
this very difficult situation,

280
00:20:18,389 --> 00:20:21,150
there are beautiful moments.

281
00:20:21,254 --> 00:20:25,707
It doesn't exist anything
in our world, only bad.

282
00:20:28,157 --> 00:20:32,472
Even the bad is beautiful, I would say.

283
00:20:32,576 --> 00:20:36,269
Even the bad is beautiful

284
00:20:36,373 --> 00:20:41,688
when you know where to look for.

285
00:20:41,792 --> 00:20:43,587
It has to be.

286
00:20:54,701 --> 00:20:58,187
When you are knowing that
you will play in the evening,

287
00:20:58,291 --> 00:21:00,845
the concert,

288
00:21:00,949 --> 00:21:08,853
and people old, terribly ill people,

289
00:21:08,957 --> 00:21:14,894
came to this concert
and became... young.

290
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,351
It is a mystery

291
00:21:23,454 --> 00:21:29,495
that when the first tone of music starts,

292
00:21:29,598 --> 00:21:34,362
it goes straight away in our soul.

293
00:21:37,192 --> 00:21:42,577
I loved to play the Number 1
and 2 études by Chopin.

294
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:45,269
The Number 1 is in C major.

295
00:21:45,373 --> 00:21:48,307
Yeah, the C major is not so quick.

296
00:21:48,410 --> 00:21:51,379
But Number 2 is quick.

297
00:21:51,482 --> 00:21:54,761
The hand is closed, chromatic,

298
00:21:54,865 --> 00:21:56,625
chromatic, very quick.

299
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:07,823
But it wasn't just the prisoners

300
00:22:07,843 --> 00:22:10,812
who drew strength from Alice's music.

301
00:22:10,915 --> 00:22:13,435
Even the camp guards listened,

302
00:22:13,539 --> 00:22:15,920
stealing a few precious moments,

303
00:22:16,024 --> 00:22:19,648
perhaps remembering the way
life used to be.

304
00:22:19,752 --> 00:22:23,825
Some of them were
standing next to the window

305
00:22:23,928 --> 00:22:26,793
and... and enjoying the music.

306
00:22:26,897 --> 00:22:29,969
Afterwards, one of them told me,

307
00:22:30,072 --> 00:22:36,562
"We always are standing here
and listening to your music."

308
00:22:48,332 --> 00:22:50,161
Sometimes it happens

309
00:22:50,265 --> 00:22:53,717
that I am thankful to have been there

310
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:57,859
because this gave me, ah...

311
00:22:57,962 --> 00:23:00,344
I am richer than other people.

312
00:23:00,448 --> 00:23:05,763
My reaction on life is...
It's quite another one.

313
00:23:05,867 --> 00:23:09,146
All the complain,
"This is terrible!"

314
00:23:09,249 --> 00:23:11,320
It's not so terrible.

315
00:23:17,499 --> 00:23:20,122
My father always used to say
the very wise words...

316
00:23:20,226 --> 00:23:22,331
"Put as much as you can into your heads

317
00:23:22,435 --> 00:23:25,162
because that's something nobody
can take away from you."

318
00:23:25,265 --> 00:23:28,476
And I think that is so very, very true.

319
00:23:28,579 --> 00:23:30,492
And I think this is where music comes in,

320
00:23:30,512 --> 00:23:32,494
the importance of music,
because you can actually

321
00:23:32,514 --> 00:23:36,380
have music in your head without
anybody knowing it is happening.

322
00:23:36,484 --> 00:23:39,763
You can actually go into another world

323
00:23:39,866 --> 00:23:43,525
which is a lot nicer than the
world we're actually living in.

324
00:23:50,083 --> 00:23:53,224
I can say without hesitation
that the cello saved my life

325
00:23:53,328 --> 00:23:55,951
because I knew what was
going on in Auschwitz.

326
00:23:56,055 --> 00:23:57,712
So I arrived in Auschwitz

327
00:23:57,815 --> 00:23:59,487
really preparing to go
in the gas chamber.

328
00:23:59,507 --> 00:24:02,302
I mean, that was Auschwitz,
was gas chambers.

329
00:24:02,406 --> 00:24:05,720
Instead of that, when I arrived there,

330
00:24:05,823 --> 00:24:07,342
some sort of ceremony,

331
00:24:07,446 --> 00:24:09,399
you know, people take
your clothes off you

332
00:24:09,482 --> 00:24:12,485
and shave your head
and tattoo a number on your arm.

333
00:24:12,589 --> 00:24:14,487
And this is all done by prisoners,

334
00:24:14,591 --> 00:24:17,248
and one of these said, "What's going on?

335
00:24:17,352 --> 00:24:18,816
How long is the war going?
Will it soon be over?"

336
00:24:18,836 --> 00:24:20,251
You know sort of,

337
00:24:20,355 --> 00:24:21,854
"What's your name,
and where do you come from,

338
00:24:21,874 --> 00:24:23,959
and what did you do before
you were arrested?"

339
00:24:23,979 --> 00:24:26,706
And like an idiot, I said,
"I used to play the cello."

340
00:24:26,810 --> 00:24:30,434
I mean, you know,
really ridiculous thing to say.

341
00:24:30,538 --> 00:24:34,438
And she said, "Oh, fantastic.
You'll be saved."

342
00:24:39,374 --> 00:24:41,341
So I became a member of this orchestra,

343
00:24:41,445 --> 00:24:42,875
which was completely life-saving

344
00:24:42,895 --> 00:24:45,242
because as long as they wanted music,

345
00:24:45,345 --> 00:24:46,810
they couldn't put us in the gas chamber.

346
00:24:46,830 --> 00:24:49,053
I mean, you know,
there's certain amount of logic

347
00:24:49,073 --> 00:24:52,732
in the Germans.

348
00:24:52,836 --> 00:24:55,265
The famous Dr. Mengele,
you know, who was interested

349
00:24:55,286 --> 00:24:58,358
in experiments on twins...
Much feared man

350
00:24:58,462 --> 00:25:00,844
because, you know, he just...

351
00:25:00,947 --> 00:25:03,640
We were just like... like guinea pigs.

352
00:25:03,743 --> 00:25:05,020
You know, it's wonderful.

353
00:25:05,124 --> 00:25:06,381
You can actually experiment on humans,

354
00:25:06,401 --> 00:25:08,107
so you don't have to have guinea pigs.

355
00:25:08,127 --> 00:25:10,681
And he came into the block.
That was another thing.

356
00:25:10,785 --> 00:25:13,630
You see, during the day anybody
could walk into the music block

357
00:25:13,650 --> 00:25:16,066
and ask for something.

358
00:25:16,169 --> 00:25:18,358
We didn't just play marches.
We played all sorts of

359
00:25:18,378 --> 00:25:20,173
what were pop songs in those days

360
00:25:20,277 --> 00:25:23,452
and arias from operettas.

361
00:25:23,556 --> 00:25:26,179
And and he wanted to hear
the "Traumerei" by Schumann,

362
00:25:26,283 --> 00:25:27,940
and that was on my repertoire.

363
00:25:28,043 --> 00:25:30,839
So I played the "Traumerei"
by Schumann to Dr. Mengele.

364
00:25:30,943 --> 00:25:32,531
Completely ludicrous situation.

365
00:25:32,634 --> 00:25:34,754
God knows what he's just been
doing before he came in

366
00:25:34,774 --> 00:25:36,880
and wanted to hear the "Traumerei"

367
00:25:36,983 --> 00:25:39,296
to, um, destroy himself a bit.

368
00:25:47,304 --> 00:25:48,768
You know, the more you think about it

369
00:25:48,788 --> 00:25:51,342
and the more you talk about it,
the more...

370
00:25:51,446 --> 00:25:53,621
macabre the whole thing is.

371
00:26:01,318 --> 00:26:02,975
I think most people,

372
00:26:03,078 --> 00:26:05,460
when they hear the word "Holocaust,"

373
00:26:05,564 --> 00:26:08,428
see only two things... gas chambers

374
00:26:08,532 --> 00:26:12,156
and the number of 6 million
and nothing in between,

375
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:16,920
but it was everythingin between.

376
00:26:17,023 --> 00:26:19,578
Survival was, in a nutshell,

377
00:26:19,681 --> 00:26:23,582
a matter of your attitude
to the situation,

378
00:26:23,685 --> 00:26:27,206
and the situation changed
every five minutes.

379
00:26:27,309 --> 00:26:30,347
And even when it was at the end,

380
00:26:30,450 --> 00:26:32,591
Bergen-Belsen...

381
00:26:32,694 --> 00:26:36,560
I was lying dying amongst 300 corpses.

382
00:26:36,664 --> 00:26:38,562
Nobody took them out.

383
00:26:38,666 --> 00:26:40,909
And the rest looked like corpses,

384
00:26:41,013 --> 00:26:43,671
were still breathing.

385
00:26:43,774 --> 00:26:47,675
It never occurred to me
that I could be one of them.

386
00:26:47,778 --> 00:26:49,504
Never.

387
00:26:52,956 --> 00:26:56,580
I never felt like a victim.

388
00:26:56,684 --> 00:26:58,513
I felt more like an observer.

389
00:26:58,617 --> 00:27:02,137
I felt it has nothing to do with me.

390
00:27:02,241 --> 00:27:04,381
I just happen to be here,

391
00:27:04,484 --> 00:27:07,626
and I have to take it as it comes.

392
00:27:10,490 --> 00:27:15,047
Survival is a very complex matter.

393
00:27:15,150 --> 00:27:16,669
You don't learn it.

394
00:27:16,773 --> 00:27:19,396
It comes to you spontaneously.

395
00:27:25,229 --> 00:27:29,958
When you were really down in the hell

396
00:27:30,062 --> 00:27:32,720
and come up again,

397
00:27:32,823 --> 00:27:37,517
you have learned what matters
in life and what doesn't,

398
00:27:37,621 --> 00:27:40,451
and what matters is very few things.

399
00:27:40,555 --> 00:27:44,766
Life matters, human relationships,

400
00:27:44,870 --> 00:27:45,905
and that's about it.

401
00:27:46,009 --> 00:27:48,770
The rest is not important.

402
00:27:48,874 --> 00:27:50,807
One can live without,

403
00:27:50,910 --> 00:27:56,675
and because of this,
it has enriched my life,

404
00:27:56,778 --> 00:28:00,264
and I'm grateful...

405
00:28:00,368 --> 00:28:02,301
for that experience.

406
00:28:02,404 --> 00:28:04,027
I can say that.

407
00:28:17,903 --> 00:28:19,712
Well, I don't think
I'm alone in the world.

408
00:28:19,732 --> 00:28:22,079
As you know, I've got loads
of grandchildren.

409
00:28:22,183 --> 00:28:24,530
You know, any trouble you go to Grandma.

410
00:28:24,633 --> 00:28:26,981
But basically everybody is
alone in the world.

411
00:28:27,084 --> 00:28:28,284
Of course.

412
00:28:28,327 --> 00:28:29,811
In the end, we are all alone.

413
00:28:29,915 --> 00:28:32,331
We are born alone.
We die alone. Yeah, I mean...

414
00:28:32,434 --> 00:28:34,989
And I feel if during the lifetime

415
00:28:35,092 --> 00:28:38,440
we find somebody who can walk with us

416
00:28:38,544 --> 00:28:41,374
part of the way,
then we are already lucky.

417
00:28:41,478 --> 00:28:42,893
Very lucky.

418
00:28:42,997 --> 00:28:45,862
Until it comes to a crossroad
and he's gone.

419
00:28:45,965 --> 00:28:50,004
So one should be grateful for the time

420
00:28:50,107 --> 00:28:51,626
that that person was with you

421
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:55,216
walking with you part of the life

422
00:28:55,319 --> 00:28:57,908
and say, "Thank you."

423
00:28:58,012 --> 00:29:01,222
My son... I can't tell you

424
00:29:01,325 --> 00:29:05,329
how beautiful my life
through this child was.

425
00:29:09,471 --> 00:29:12,992
After the war, Alice and Rafi
left Europe for Israel,

426
00:29:13,096 --> 00:29:15,374
where he followed his mother's example,

427
00:29:15,477 --> 00:29:18,584
making his career in music.

428
00:29:18,687 --> 00:29:20,448
For almost 50 years,

429
00:29:20,551 --> 00:29:22,830
celebrated cellist Raphael Sommer

430
00:29:22,933 --> 00:29:26,385
performed all around the world.

431
00:29:26,488 --> 00:29:30,561
He had a concert in Israel on Tuesday.

432
00:29:30,665 --> 00:29:33,150
In the evening, he didn't feel well,

433
00:29:33,254 --> 00:29:35,532
so they took him into the hospital.

434
00:29:35,635 --> 00:29:39,225
They gave him an anesthetic...
You know what it is?

435
00:29:39,329 --> 00:29:42,090
And he didn't, uh...

436
00:29:42,194 --> 00:29:45,059
He didn't, uh...

437
00:29:45,162 --> 00:29:46,681
He died.

438
00:29:46,785 --> 00:29:51,030
So he was 64 years old.

439
00:29:51,134 --> 00:29:53,619
He didn't suffer.

440
00:29:53,722 --> 00:29:59,107
He didn't know that he will die,
and he...

441
00:29:59,211 --> 00:30:01,213
It's a privilege.

442
00:30:01,316 --> 00:30:05,079
I have to be thankful he didn't, uh...

443
00:30:05,182 --> 00:30:06,701
He didn't suffer.

444
00:30:12,672 --> 00:30:16,918
He didn't know what it is to be old.

445
00:30:17,022 --> 00:30:22,096
In this age, you are not yet old... 64.

446
00:30:27,135 --> 00:30:31,174
On Tuesday, he didn't know that
on Wednesday he will die

447
00:30:31,277 --> 00:30:34,487
without pains.

448
00:30:34,591 --> 00:30:38,837
This is the greatest miracle
and privilege,

449
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:44,532
and I am thankful every day
100, 100, 100 times.

450
00:30:57,717 --> 00:31:02,170
It depends on me whether life
is good or not... on me.

451
00:31:02,274 --> 00:31:05,622
Not on life, on me.

452
00:31:05,725 --> 00:31:10,040
Everything is good or bad.
I look at the good side.

453
00:31:19,498 --> 00:31:23,812
I think perhaps
we don't take life for granted.

454
00:31:23,916 --> 00:31:26,436
It was given to us twice...
Once we were born

455
00:31:26,539 --> 00:31:30,198
and then... then we didn't die,

456
00:31:30,302 --> 00:31:32,994
contrary to the intention of the Germans,

457
00:31:33,098 --> 00:31:35,410
and we had another chance.

458
00:31:35,514 --> 00:31:40,691
I suppose maybe we, uh...
We used it more consciously,

459
00:31:40,795 --> 00:31:42,486
didn't just take it for granted.

460
00:31:42,590 --> 00:31:45,055
"Well, you live in this world
and we are very depressed,"

461
00:31:45,075 --> 00:31:48,182
and whatever people indulge in.

462
00:31:53,083 --> 00:31:54,602
Even today,

463
00:31:54,705 --> 00:31:58,986
Alice relentlessly practices
the music that she loves.

464
00:31:59,089 --> 00:32:01,298
After a century at the keyboard,

465
00:32:01,402 --> 00:32:04,784
she's still searching for perfection.

466
00:32:04,888 --> 00:32:08,685
Without work, you can't achieve anything.

467
00:32:10,687 --> 00:32:17,107
Millions and millions of hours
working on what you love.

468
00:32:17,211 --> 00:32:20,214
When you love something,
work and work and work

469
00:32:20,317 --> 00:32:21,594
and work it.

470
00:32:32,433 --> 00:32:38,163
A lot of German journalists
come and want to know,

471
00:32:38,266 --> 00:32:40,027
speak with me and so on.

472
00:32:40,130 --> 00:32:43,927
Before they enter my room, they ask,

473
00:32:44,031 --> 00:32:46,447
"Are we allowed to enter your room?

474
00:32:46,550 --> 00:32:49,243
Do you not hate us?"

475
00:32:49,346 --> 00:32:53,626
So my answer is, "I never hated
and I never hate."

476
00:32:53,730 --> 00:32:57,423
Hatred brings only hatred.

477
00:33:05,155 --> 00:33:08,400
We should thank Bach,

478
00:33:08,503 --> 00:33:14,578
Beethoven to Brahms
to Schubert to Schumann.

479
00:33:14,682 --> 00:33:17,167
They gave us beauty.

480
00:33:17,271 --> 00:33:22,828
They gave us undescribable beauty.

481
00:33:22,931 --> 00:33:26,280
They made us more happy.

482
00:33:42,675 --> 00:33:45,161
The remarkable Alice Sommer...

483
00:33:45,264 --> 00:33:50,614
At 109, the oldest
Holocaust survivor in the world.

484
00:33:50,718 --> 00:33:56,689
Only when we are so old... only...

485
00:33:56,793 --> 00:34:01,142
We are aware of the beauty of life.
