<i>who'd had the man she loved
ripped away from her.</i>

172
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:19,189
<i>Including my own mother.</i>

173
00:13:26,675 --> 00:13:29,765
- Allison.
- Dad, where are you going?

174
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:35,684
- Uh... Honey, your mother
will explain it to you.

175
00:13:35,727 --> 00:13:38,252
<i>It has nothing to do with you..</i>

176
00:13:38,295 --> 00:13:41,951
<i>Sometimes parents, they uh..</i>

177
00:13:41,995 --> 00:13:44,911
You'll understand when
you're a little older.

178
00:13:51,439 --> 00:13:53,484
- <i>Dad?</i>

179
00:13:55,399 --> 00:13:57,837
Dad!

180
00:14:10,893 --> 00:14:13,287
<i>Brian had a cabin
outside of town.</i>

181
00:14:13,330 --> 00:14:17,073
<i>Taking Jordan's body there
wasn't easy for me.</i>

182
00:14:18,945 --> 00:14:22,687
<i>He and I had some wonderful
weekends at that place.</i>

183
00:14:22,731 --> 00:14:24,776
<i>But those times were over.</i>

184
00:15:11,736 --> 00:15:15,349
- Mom, I honestly don't
understand what the big deal is.

185
00:15:15,392 --> 00:15:19,919
No one's gonna know if
I'm fifteen minutes late.

186
00:15:19,962 --> 00:15:22,965
- The judge made it very clear.
Your curfew is eleven.

187
00:15:23,009 --> 00:15:26,708
- But it's summer. Everyone
else gets to be out until
at least midnight.

188
00:15:26,751 --> 00:15:30,146
I look like an idiot checking my
watch every fifteen minutes.

189
00:15:30,190 --> 00:15:32,453
Come on.

190
00:15:32,496 --> 00:15:34,803
Mike and I are just gonna hang
out and play guitar. That's it.

191
00:15:34,846 --> 00:15:37,719
- You're on probation,
Scott, for one more year.

192
00:15:37,762 --> 00:15:39,721
[Sighs]

193
00:15:40,896 --> 00:15:44,944
- Brian. You get what
I'm saying, right?

194
00:15:44,987 --> 00:15:48,164
Can you please explain
to her that the whole
world isn't gonna end

195
00:15:48,208 --> 00:15:50,384
because of 15 stupid minutes!

196
00:15:50,427 --> 00:15:53,256
- Well, I think if the judge
wanted your curfew to be 11:15

197
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:55,476
he would've said so.

198
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:58,783
But that's not really the point.
What you mom is saying is that

199
00:15:58,827 --> 00:16:02,135
she wants you to do
the right thing because
it's the right thing to do.

200
00:16:02,178 --> 00:16:05,573
- No! You know what? Mom?

201
00:16:05,616 --> 00:16:09,794
I cannot wait until I turn 18 so
I can get the hell out of here!

202
00:16:13,233 --> 00:16:15,800
- Aren't you glad
you didn't have twins?

203
00:16:15,844 --> 00:16:18,934
I better get going.

204
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:20,892
Harvey's been sick all week

205
00:16:20,936 --> 00:16:23,417
and his entire presentation
is resting on my shoulders.

206
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:26,376
- Oh, I'm sure they'll love your
campaign, it'll be brilliant.

207
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:29,031
- As long as it sells more
toothpaste, everyone
will be happy.

208
00:16:29,075 --> 00:16:32,165
Love you.
- I love you.

209
00:16:33,775 --> 00:16:35,733
- Maybe just one
more for the road.

210
00:16:37,170 --> 00:16:39,215
What are you doing
for lunch tomorrow?

211
00:16:39,259 --> 00:16:42,044
I think I could finish this
presentation around noon.

212
00:16:42,088 --> 00:16:44,394
- I'm free.
- Good.

213
00:16:44,438 --> 00:16:47,006
Pick you up at 12:30.
- Okay.

214
00:16:47,049 --> 00:16:49,008
- See you.

215
00:17:08,418 --> 00:17:11,073
- As usual.

216
00:17:27,829 --> 00:17:30,179
[Loud music in earphones]

217
00:17:59,382 --> 00:18:01,471
[Tires screeching]
- Ah!

218
00:18:01,515 --> 00:18:03,082
Ah!

219
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:35,810
- As you two get even closer,
things might get harder for him.

220
00:18:35,853 --> 00:18:38,160
- Scott seems to like Brian.

221
00:18:38,204 --> 00:18:40,467
I mean, he hasn't come
out and said that, but,

222
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:44,123
he did ask him his opinion
about a girl last week.

223
00:18:44,166 --> 00:18:46,386
- I'm not saying it has
anything to with Brian, but

224
00:18:46,429 --> 00:18:49,128
when things get finalized
and Brian moves in,

225
00:18:49,171 --> 00:18:52,305
Scott might be thinking more
and more about the fact
that he lost his dad.

226
00:18:52,348 --> 00:18:54,916
- I'm not sure he'd
talk to me about that.

227
00:18:54,959 --> 00:18:57,092
- Well, just be patient.

228
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:59,355
Scott will eventually figure
out that you're not enemy
number one.

229
00:18:59,399 --> 00:19:01,314
[Laughing]

230
00:19:09,409 --> 00:19:13,195
[Cell phone ringing]

231
00:19:14,849 --> 00:19:16,720
- <i>Hi, this is Brian Hagan,
not here to take your call.</i>

232
00:19:16,764 --> 00:19:18,722
<i>Please leave a message.
[Beep]</i>

233
00:19:18,766 --> 00:19:21,682
- Hey hon, it's me, I'm just
wondering where you are.

234
00:19:21,725 --> 00:19:25,120
Maybe your presentation ran
late. Um, give me a call

235
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:26,991
when you get this. See you soon.

236
00:19:29,559 --> 00:19:31,735
[Ringing]
- [Brian Hagan's office.]

237
00:19:31,779 --> 00:19:34,303
- Hi, Candice, it's Kathryn.
Is Brian there?

238
00:19:34,347 --> 00:19:36,914
- [Uh, no. I was about to call
you to see if you knew
where he was.]

239
00:19:36,958 --> 00:19:38,873
[He didn't show up for his
presentation this morning.]

240
00:19:38,916 --> 00:19:40,614
- What?

241
00:19:40,657 --> 00:19:42,529
- [And he didn't call. Nothing.]

242
00:19:42,572 --> 00:19:46,010
- Umm. That's not like him.

243
00:19:46,054 --> 00:19:47,969
Call me as soon as you
hear from him, okay?

244
00:19:48,012 --> 00:19:50,189
- [I will. Bye.]

245
00:19:56,543 --> 00:19:58,458
[Cell phone ringing]

246
00:19:58,501 --> 00:20:02,026
- Thank God, sweetie,
where are you?

247
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:04,290
- [Man's voice]: May I speak
to Kathryn Brown, please?]

248
00:20:04,333 --> 00:20:06,335
- I'm sorry, who is this?

249
00:20:06,379 --> 00:20:09,599
- [Detecting Simmons. I'm
looking at Brian Hagan's
emergency contact list.]

250
00:20:09,643 --> 00:20:11,906
- Emergency contact?
- [Are you Kathryn Brown?]

251
00:20:11,949 --> 00:20:14,082
- Yes, that's me.

252
00:20:14,125 --> 00:20:16,302
- [What is your relationship
to Mr. Hagan?]

253
00:20:16,345 --> 00:20:19,218
- He's my fiancé.
What's going on?

254
00:20:19,261 --> 00:20:21,698
- [There's been an accident.
I'm sorry. Mr. Hagan's dead.]

255
00:20:21,742 --> 00:20:23,178
- Wha...

256
00:20:26,964 --> 00:20:28,923
you don’t want me to stay longer?

257
00:20:28,966 --> 00:20:31,578
I can.
- No, it's okay.

258
00:20:31,621 --> 00:20:34,711
- I'm gonna call later,
and see how you're doing.

259
00:20:34,755 --> 00:20:36,974
But if there's anything at
all that you need before then

260
00:20:37,018 --> 00:20:40,413
my cell is on.
- Thanks, Joy.

261
00:20:46,506 --> 00:20:48,464
- Kathryn.

262
00:20:48,508 --> 00:20:51,859
Again, I'm... I'm so sorry.

263
00:20:51,902 --> 00:20:54,253
- Thanks, Ian, I'm glad
you could make it.

264
00:20:54,296 --> 00:20:56,864
- So, have you heard
from Jordan yet?

265
00:20:56,907 --> 00:21:00,737
- No, I called and left her a
message on the cell phone number

266
00:21:00,781 --> 00:21:03,697
that Brian had for her, but
she never called me back.

267
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:05,960
- She may not even be
in the country right now.

268
00:21:06,003 --> 00:21:07,744
She's always coming and going.

269
00:21:07,788 --> 00:21:09,442
Who knows if she even
got the message.

270
00:21:09,485 --> 00:21:12,358
She'll be very upset
she missed the funeral.

271
00:21:12,401 --> 00:21:14,316
Brian's the only
family she had left.

272
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:16,666
- When was the last
time you talked to her?

273
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:20,627
- I haven't seen her
in two or three years.

274
00:21:20,670 --> 00:21:23,760
- I even called the woman who
owns the boarding house
where she stays,

275
00:21:23,804 --> 00:21:26,285
and she hasn't seen
her in weeks.

276
00:21:26,328 --> 00:21:28,287
- There's not much
more you can do.

277
00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:30,071
She'll get the message
eventually.

278
00:21:30,114 --> 00:21:32,682
So, how are you holding up?

279
00:21:32,726 --> 00:21:36,033
- I'm still in
shock to be honest.

280
00:21:38,166 --> 00:21:41,256
- Look, um, I'm going
back to New York tomorrow.

281
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,171
I'll back out here
in a couple of weeks.

282
00:21:43,214 --> 00:21:45,782
I'd like to take you
out to lunch or something.

283
00:21:45,826 --> 00:21:48,611
- Okay. Sure.

284
00:21:48,655 --> 00:21:51,135
Thanks for being
such a good friend.

285
00:21:51,179 --> 00:21:53,529
- Well, I loved
you very much.

286
00:22:24,430 --> 00:22:26,432
- Um, Kathryn?

287
00:22:26,475 --> 00:22:28,390
- Yes?

288
00:22:31,872 --> 00:22:33,917
- I'm sorry to just
show up like this.

289
00:22:33,961 --> 00:22:36,703
Um, I just couldn't
believe it when I heard.

290
00:22:36,746 --> 00:22:39,053
- Are you Jordan?

291
00:22:39,096 --> 00:22:42,796
- I can't believe he's gone!

292
00:22:42,839 --> 00:22:44,798
- Oh, honey. Come on in.

293
00:22:49,933 --> 00:22:52,980
- I was horrified when
I finally got your message.

294
00:22:53,023 --> 00:22:56,375
And I realized I had
missed his funeral.

295
00:22:58,420 --> 00:23:01,945
My cell phone was stolen. And
I didn't replace it till
I got back here.

296
00:23:01,989 --> 00:23:05,296
I was down in Charleston
for a big rally.

297
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:08,561
- Brian told me you were
active in a lot of causes.

298
00:23:10,911 --> 00:23:14,523
- I was always busy. You know?

299
00:23:16,482 --> 00:23:18,701
I should've come
to see him more often.

300
00:23:18,745 --> 00:23:22,052
When he told me that he was
being transferred to
Philadelphia,

301
00:23:22,096 --> 00:23:24,054
I told him...

302
00:23:24,098 --> 00:23:26,709
told him...

303
00:23:26,753 --> 00:23:28,885
that I would visit.

304
00:23:28,929 --> 00:23:34,151
And here he is, two years
later, and I never did.

305
00:23:34,195 --> 00:23:37,416
- Honey, you could have never
known this was gonna happen.

306
00:23:37,459 --> 00:23:39,505
- No.

307
00:23:41,681 --> 00:23:44,074
No one could've
known I suppose.

308
00:23:45,815 --> 00:23:48,862
Well, even though I missed
the funeral, I just...

309
00:23:48,905 --> 00:23:51,604
I have to help take care
of his things, you know.

310
00:23:51,647 --> 00:23:53,606
There was so much to do.

311
00:23:53,649 --> 00:23:56,478
After our parents died.

312
00:23:56,522 --> 00:24:00,526
And um, Brian
did most of it.

313
00:24:06,053 --> 00:24:08,838
- Where are you staying?
Do you have friends here?

314
00:24:08,882 --> 00:24:13,626
- No. No, I don't know
anybody in Philadelphia.

315
00:24:15,758 --> 00:24:19,153
I was thinking about
staying at Brian's, but...

316
00:24:19,196 --> 00:24:22,069
I don't know, seeing
all of his...

317
00:24:22,112 --> 00:24:26,595
stuff around me. Might
be just too, um... hard.

318
00:24:26,639 --> 00:24:29,555
- I understand.

319
00:24:31,687 --> 00:24:33,297
[Sighs]

320
00:24:33,341 --> 00:24:35,082
- You know, I think
I'll just get a room.

321
00:24:35,125 --> 00:24:38,912
I saw some motels.

322
00:24:38,955 --> 00:24:42,219
Out on the highway as
I was coming into town. So.

323
00:24:44,221 --> 00:24:46,528
- Are you sure?

324
00:24:46,572 --> 00:24:49,096
Jordan, you can
stay here with me.

325
00:24:49,139 --> 00:24:51,533
Wow, thank you.

326
00:24:51,577 --> 00:24:53,883
This is a beautiful home.

327
00:24:53,927 --> 00:24:56,451
- Thank you.

328
00:24:56,495 --> 00:24:59,367
- My husband and I bought it
twenty years ago and,

329
00:24:59,410 --> 00:25:04,677
when he died, I um,
I didn't want to leave.

330
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:07,549
- Well, I can see why.

331
00:25:07,593 --> 00:25:09,420
Thank you for the invitation.

332
00:25:11,292 --> 00:25:13,512
- It's my pleasure.

333
00:25:13,555 --> 00:25:18,691
After all, you know,
you're... practically family.

334
00:25:20,867 --> 00:25:22,782
- [Sobbing]: Oh, thanks.

335
00:25:22,825 --> 00:25:33,619
Brian told me you were
a really nice person.

336
00:25:33,662 --> 00:25:35,621
- Extra blankets
are in the closet.

337
00:25:35,664 --> 00:25:37,405
And the bathroom
is just down the hall.

338
00:25:37,448 --> 00:25:39,842
- Oh, this is great, Kathryn.

339
00:25:39,886 --> 00:25:42,584
Much nicer than where
I usually stay.

340
00:25:42,628 --> 00:25:45,413
- I'm sure you're tired,
I'll let you get some rest.

341
00:25:45,456 --> 00:25:48,372
And I'm gonna go run some
errands, and I'll make
some dinner later.

342
00:25:48,416 --> 00:25:50,940
- Thank you. If there's
anything I can do to help...

343
00:25:50,984 --> 00:25:53,160
- No, not at all.
Just so you know,

344
00:25:53,203 --> 00:25:56,467
Scott should be home in about
an hour, in case he gets
here before I do.

345
00:25:56,511 --> 00:25:58,948
- Alright. Well, I can't
wait to meet him.

346
00:25:58,992 --> 00:26:00,515
- Okay.

347
00:26:04,867 --> 00:26:07,478
- <i>Kathryn bought my act,
hook, line and sinker.</i>

348
00:26:07,522 --> 00:26:11,352
<i>She had no idea how much
I wanted to meet her son.</i>

349
00:27:01,445 --> 00:27:03,622
"Triple Kill."

350
00:27:38,395 --> 00:27:41,877
Will Scott and I become
the best of friends?

351
00:27:44,401 --> 00:27:46,795
"Most definitely."

352
00:27:57,588 --> 00:28:01,592
- I did get the notice that you
completed your community
service.

353
00:28:01,636 --> 00:28:05,988
That's good.
That's very good.

354
00:28:06,032 --> 00:28:08,251
So.

355
00:28:08,295 --> 00:28:10,210
How's work?

356
00:28:10,253 --> 00:28:12,691
- Fine.

357
00:28:12,734 --> 00:28:14,649
- You getting there on time?

358
00:28:14,693 --> 00:28:16,738
You're not having any problems
with any of the other employees?

359
00:28:16,782 --> 00:28:18,348
- No problems.

360
00:28:18,392 --> 00:28:22,004
- Good. That's good.

361
00:28:22,048 --> 00:28:24,746
Keep following the rules,
you'll be in good shape.

362
00:28:27,488 --> 00:28:29,185
- Uh, sir?

363
00:28:30,752 --> 00:28:32,841
Me and a couple
of my friends,

364
00:28:32,885 --> 00:28:36,279
we're thinking of going to
Baltimore to see a band there.

365
00:28:36,323 --> 00:28:37,933
- You know you can't
leave the county.

366
00:28:37,977 --> 00:28:41,545
- Yeah, I know, but...
I was thinking, maybe...

367
00:28:41,589 --> 00:28:44,200
- You know the rules, Scott.

368
00:28:46,812 --> 00:28:49,945
Look if things
keep going smoothly,

369
00:28:49,989 --> 00:28:51,904
for the next six months
or so, I'll consider it.

370
00:28:51,947 --> 00:28:54,254
But not for now.

371
00:28:54,297 --> 00:28:58,737
Look, you're on
the good path. Stay on it.

372
00:28:58,780 --> 00:29:01,870
I'll see you in a
couple of weeks, okay?

373
00:29:01,914 --> 00:29:03,524
And be on time.

374
00:29:08,094 --> 00:29:10,444
- Honey, do you have
any concept of time?

375
00:29:10,487 --> 00:29:14,404
- Scott: [Yes!]
- You said you would
be home by now.

376
00:29:14,448 --> 00:29:17,625
- Yes, mom, I know I'm late. But
I'm two seconds away from my car

377
00:29:17,668 --> 00:29:20,410
then I'm gonna get in, I'm going
to drive, and I will be home

378
00:29:20,454 --> 00:29:22,499
in twenty minutes max.

379
00:29:25,372 --> 00:29:28,244
Give me a break, will you?
I'm not seven years old.

380
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:35,469
- He sometimes has trouble
keeping on time.

381
00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:39,952
- Did Brian ever tell you
anything about Scott?

382
00:29:39,995 --> 00:29:42,302
- Nothing really.

383
00:29:42,345 --> 00:29:44,304
- Well, he's been in
some trouble lately.

384
00:29:44,347 --> 00:29:46,175
- Oh?

385
00:29:46,219 --> 00:29:49,831
- Two years ago, not long
after his dad passed away,

386
00:29:49,875 --> 00:29:53,139
he and another boy,
Jason, stole a car

387
00:29:53,182 --> 00:29:56,185
and went on a spray painting
spree at Scott's school.

388
00:29:56,229 --> 00:29:58,405
- Uh-oh.

389
00:29:58,448 --> 00:30:00,929
- Yeah, so he's on probation,
and has to follow all the rules

390
00:30:00,973 --> 00:30:03,192
or he may wind up back
in juvenile hall.

391
00:30:03,236 --> 00:30:04,759
- Huh...

392
00:30:04,803 --> 00:30:06,805
Rules. What kind of rules?

393
00:30:06,848 --> 00:30:08,807
- Like he has to keep
his appointments,

394
00:30:08,850 --> 00:30:11,548
obey his curfew, stay
fairly close to home.

395
00:30:11,592 --> 00:30:15,074
- Wow, that must be
tough for a teenager.
He can't even leave the city?

396
00:30:15,117 --> 00:30:18,773
- He can't even leave
the county. Which pretty
much is the city.

397
00:30:18,817 --> 00:30:21,036
- What if he has to go on
a school trip or something?

398
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:23,734
- He can't go.
A few weeks ago,

399
00:30:23,778 --> 00:30:26,781
his whole chemistry class went
to Pittsburgh and he had
to stay behind.

400
00:30:26,825 --> 00:30:30,829
- Wow. That's awful.

401
00:30:30,872 --> 00:30:33,135
- Uh, listen, because Scott's
running a little late,

402
00:30:33,179 --> 00:30:35,311
I'm gonna go to the den
and do some paper work.

403
00:30:35,355 --> 00:30:37,400
Um, do you mind
watching the sauce?

404
00:30:37,444 --> 00:30:39,359
- No, no, that's fine.

405
00:30:39,402 --> 00:30:43,189
<i>I just hit a major
bump in my plan.</i>

406
00:30:43,232 --> 00:30:46,583
<i>I had no idea Scott
was on a leash</i>

407
00:30:46,627 --> 00:30:48,934
<i>held by the police.</i>

408
00:30:48,977 --> 00:30:52,241
<i>It was going to be
harder than I thought to
get what I wanted from him.</i>

409
00:30:52,285 --> 00:30:55,984
<i>But I'd come too far
to let this stop me.</i>

410
00:31:08,388 --> 00:31:09,998
- [Scott]: Hello?

411
00:31:15,525 --> 00:31:18,441
- Hi. I'm Jordan.
Brian's sister.

412
00:31:18,485 --> 00:31:19,878
- Scott.

413
00:31:21,488 --> 00:31:23,446
- Glad you could make it.

414
00:31:23,490 --> 00:31:25,796
- Your mother invited
me to stay here for a few
days. I hope you don't mind.

415
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:27,929
- No, that's cool.

416
00:31:27,973 --> 00:31:30,671
I'm starving.

417
00:31:30,714 --> 00:31:33,021
- Then let's get that pasta.

418
00:31:45,207 --> 00:31:47,166
This one's of us in the Bahamas.

419
00:31:47,209 --> 00:31:50,038
God we loved that trip.

420
00:31:50,082 --> 00:31:52,345
- Wow, you really took
a lot of pictures.

421
00:31:52,388 --> 00:31:55,826
- Yeah, and I organized
them all into this album

422
00:31:55,870 --> 00:31:58,003
because Brian wasn't
one for keeping them.

423
00:31:58,046 --> 00:32:00,614
I can't believe he didn't
have any pictures of you.

424
00:32:02,572 --> 00:32:05,967
- Well, you know Brian. He
wasn't into taking pictures.

425
00:32:06,011 --> 00:32:08,317
This is the three
of us at the beach.

426
00:32:08,361 --> 00:32:12,017
Scott wanted to learn how to
surf, so Brian and I took him.

427
00:32:14,106 --> 00:32:16,325
- [Brian]: <i>A toast.</i>

428
00:32:16,369 --> 00:32:18,066
<i>To you.</i>

429
00:32:22,027 --> 00:32:23,550
- Mm...

430
00:32:23,593 --> 00:32:25,160
- Mm...

431
00:32:25,204 --> 00:32:29,295
- I love champagne.
You're such a gentleman.

432
00:32:29,338 --> 00:32:31,514
- Anything for
your birthday.

433
00:32:33,299 --> 00:32:35,954
- I can't tell you how
much I appreciate this.

434
00:32:35,997 --> 00:32:38,086
Since my grandmother died,

435
00:32:38,130 --> 00:32:40,567
I haven't had any family
to celebrate with.

436
00:32:40,610 --> 00:32:45,876
And nothing is lonelier than
being by yourself on
your birthday.

437
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:49,141
- Yes, well, this year
will be different.

438
00:32:49,184 --> 00:32:53,449
- Everything's been different
since I met you, Brian.

439
00:32:53,493 --> 00:32:56,191
I love you.

440
00:33:02,110 --> 00:33:04,199
- Mm, look at this one.

441
00:33:06,941 --> 00:33:08,899
- Wow. You look great.

442
00:33:08,943 --> 00:33:12,164
I'm really glad
Brian found you.

443
00:33:12,207 --> 00:33:15,732
Did he tell you about
any of his exes?

444
00:33:15,776 --> 00:33:18,735
- A little bit
about his ex-wife,

445
00:33:18,779 --> 00:33:22,565
and then that one crazy
woman he dated for a while.

446
00:33:22,609 --> 00:33:24,785
Did you ever meet her?

447
00:33:24,828 --> 00:33:27,788
- Uh, no. What
was her name?

448
00:33:27,831 --> 00:33:32,010
- Uh, Ali, Alice, Allison,
something like that.

449
00:33:32,053 --> 00:33:34,099
I don't know,
a complete psycho.

450
00:33:36,101 --> 00:33:39,234
- No, he never said
anything like that to me.

451
00:33:39,278 --> 00:33:41,062
- Well, he didn't really
like to talk about her.

452
00:33:41,106 --> 00:33:43,325
I mean, he told me
a couple of stories.

453
00:33:43,369 --> 00:33:45,849
Apparently she was very
jealous and obsessive.

454
00:33:45,893 --> 00:33:48,069
She used to accuse him all
the time of cheating on her.

455
00:33:48,113 --> 00:33:50,289
She would just show
up at restaurants

456
00:33:50,332 --> 00:33:52,160
when he was trying to take
clients out to dinner.

457
00:33:52,204 --> 00:33:54,119
- She did?

458
00:33:54,162 --> 00:33:55,903
- He finally just
got so sick of her.

459
00:33:55,946 --> 00:33:58,819
He told me
when he met me

460
00:33:58,862 --> 00:34:02,997
he was so happy to meet
someone refreshingly normal.

461
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:05,391
Can you imagine?

462
00:34:07,567 --> 00:34:09,221
Poor Brian.

463
00:34:12,398 --> 00:34:15,053
I miss him so much.

464
00:34:17,272 --> 00:34:19,535
- So do I.

465
00:34:21,842 --> 00:34:25,802
[Guitar playing]

466
00:34:27,848 --> 00:34:29,545
- Hey!

467
00:34:29,589 --> 00:34:31,504
- Hey.

468
00:34:32,766 --> 00:34:36,248
You're into music? Me too.

469
00:34:36,291 --> 00:34:39,338
- Yeah? What kind
of music do you like?

470
00:34:39,381 --> 00:34:41,383
- Oh, all sorts of stuff.

471
00:34:41,427 --> 00:34:44,256
You know Top 40,
alternative, rock.

472
00:34:44,299 --> 00:34:45,953
- What rock bands
do you like?

473
00:34:45,996 --> 00:34:49,609
- Oh, well...

474
00:34:49,652 --> 00:34:53,091
My favorites would have to be,
from classic rock, ACDC.

475
00:34:53,134 --> 00:34:56,137
And, um, newer
bands, Triple kill.

476
00:34:56,181 --> 00:35:00,141
- Triple kill? Man I love
those guys, I can't believe
you listen to them.

477
00:35:00,185 --> 00:35:03,275
- Why wouldn't I? Don't
you dare say I'm too old.

478
00:35:03,318 --> 00:35:05,451
- No no, that's not
what I meant.

479
00:35:05,494 --> 00:35:07,801
You know, they're playing
in Baltimore next month.

480
00:35:07,844 --> 00:35:09,324
- Really?

481
00:35:09,368 --> 00:35:11,109
Maybe we could go
see them together.

482
00:35:11,152 --> 00:35:13,589
- No, I can't go.

483
00:35:13,633 --> 00:35:15,504
It's too far, you know.

484
00:35:15,548 --> 00:35:17,724
Part of my probation.

485
00:35:17,767 --> 00:35:20,988
- Well, that sucks. What
if your mom was okay with it?

486
00:35:21,031 --> 00:35:23,512
- Mm-mm, I still couldn't go.

487
00:35:23,556 --> 00:35:25,688
My probation officer's
like super strict.

488
00:35:25,732 --> 00:35:27,473
He'd totally freak.

489
00:35:27,516 --> 00:35:31,129
- Mm, well maybe they'll
play Philadelphia soon.

490
00:35:31,172 --> 00:35:34,393
Hey, what's "Jitters Café"?

491
00:35:34,436 --> 00:35:37,961
- Oh, it's just a coffee
shop where I work.

492
00:35:38,005 --> 00:35:41,226
- Well, maybe I'll
come check it out.

493
00:35:41,269 --> 00:35:44,229
- Yeah, you know,
anytime you want.

494
00:35:44,272 --> 00:35:46,405
- Cool.

495
00:35:46,448 --> 00:35:48,407
Well, I guess I'll let
you get back to playing.

496
00:35:48,450 --> 00:35:51,018
- Yeah.

497
00:35:51,061 --> 00:35:56,284
- Hey. Maybe we can see Triple
Kill, you know, some other time.

498
00:35:56,328 --> 00:35:57,807
- Yeah.

499
00:36:04,118 --> 00:36:06,642
- Think!

500
00:36:06,686 --> 00:36:09,036
Okay.

501
00:36:09,079 --> 00:36:11,256
There's gotta be a way.

502
00:36:17,610 --> 00:36:21,135
Good morning. It smells
really wonderful.

503
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:23,355
- Would you like some?
- Sure.

504
00:36:23,398 --> 00:36:25,661
- Oh, by the way, I meant
to tell you, Jordan,

505
00:36:25,705 --> 00:36:27,837
if you need help with
Brian's things later,

506
00:36:27,881 --> 00:36:29,709
I'd be more than
happy to help.

507
00:36:29,752 --> 00:36:31,101
- Aw, thanks.

508
00:36:31,145 --> 00:36:34,148
Thanks, but, I'll be okay.

509
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:38,239
I'm just gonna head over there
and start in on his stuff.

510
00:36:38,283 --> 00:36:40,981
- Morning.
- Hey honey, would you like some
breakfast before you go to work?

511
00:36:41,024 --> 00:36:43,070
- Mm, something quick.

512
00:36:43,113 --> 00:36:45,551
- Hey, I thought I might stop
by the café later and grab
a cappuccino.

513
00:36:45,594 --> 00:36:47,814
- Mm, yeah, that'd be cool.

514
00:36:47,857 --> 00:36:49,946
And it's on me.

515
00:36:49,990 --> 00:36:53,863
- Well then, if you're buying,
I'll definitely stop by.

516
00:36:53,907 --> 00:36:56,997
I'll probably
need a, you know,

517
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:59,434
break later anyway.

518
00:37:00,957 --> 00:37:05,440
- Okay, well, I gotta role.

519
00:37:05,484 --> 00:37:08,008
- That's nice.

520
00:37:09,444 --> 00:37:11,794
- Do you happen to
have a house key

521
00:37:11,838 --> 00:37:14,057
that I could borrow just in case
I get back before you guys?

522
00:37:14,101 --> 00:37:15,581
- Absolutely.
Top drawer on the left.

523
00:37:28,898 --> 00:37:31,336
- Thanks.

524
00:37:37,777 --> 00:37:38,995
- Hey.

525
00:37:39,039 --> 00:37:42,042
- Hey, yeah, I'm almost
done here so...

526
00:37:42,085 --> 00:37:44,784
- No rush, I'll just go inside
and decide what I want.

527
00:37:44,827 --> 00:37:46,612
- Okay.

528
00:37:54,489 --> 00:37:56,448
- Hi, can I help you?

529
00:37:56,491 --> 00:38:01,844
- Um, yes. I'd like an iced
caramel coffee blended please.

530
00:38:01,888 --> 00:38:03,672
- Sure.

531
00:38:03,716 --> 00:38:05,239
- Her drinks on me okay, bro?

532
00:38:06,719 --> 00:38:10,200
- Ah, you must be Jordan.
Scott told me about you.

533
00:38:10,244 --> 00:38:14,204
- Did he say nice things?
- As a matter of fact, he did.

534
00:38:16,729 --> 00:38:18,687
- Hey, love your tat,
that's cool.

535
00:38:18,731 --> 00:38:21,299
- Yeah, thanks. I got
one on my back too.

536
00:38:22,778 --> 00:38:25,346
- Hey, uh, I was thinking
of getting one too.

537
00:38:25,390 --> 00:38:29,568
- Yeah? I almost got
one last year.

538
00:38:29,611 --> 00:38:32,135
- Yeah, my mom she'd probably
flip out if I did though.

539
00:38:32,179 --> 00:38:35,008
I'd never hear
the end of it.

540
00:38:35,051 --> 00:38:38,577
- Dude, so just get one
where she can't see it.

541
00:38:38,620 --> 00:38:42,624
- There's one in a magazine that
I saw that I really liked, but,

542
00:38:42,668 --> 00:38:44,757
I don't know.

543
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:47,586
- You don't think your
mom would be okay with it? I
mean everybody's got them now.

544
00:38:47,629 --> 00:38:51,111
- Trust me, that
doesn't matter.

545
00:38:51,154 --> 00:38:55,071
- See, I was thinking of getting
one in memory of Brian.

546
00:38:55,115 --> 00:38:57,900
Kinda like, he'd
always be with me.

547
00:38:57,944 --> 00:39:00,990
- That's a really
good idea, Jordan.

548
00:39:01,034 --> 00:39:05,255
- I thought maybe a little
sunburst on my back.

549
00:39:05,299 --> 00:39:07,083
Think I should do it?

550
00:39:07,127 --> 00:39:09,564
If it'll make you feel better,
then yeah, definitely.

551
00:39:09,608 --> 00:39:14,177
- Will you go with me?
We could do it now?

552
00:39:14,221 --> 00:39:16,876
- I would be happy to.

553
00:39:16,919 --> 00:39:19,357
Um, yeah!

554
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:21,750
- Good. For Brian.

555
00:39:21,794 --> 00:39:25,363
- Okay. I just gotta
get my bag and my jacket.

556
00:39:31,891 --> 00:39:34,197
- [Tattoo artist]: Alright,
gorgeous, you're good to go.

557
00:39:34,241 --> 00:39:36,417
- [Laughing]: Are you
sure you don't want one?

558
00:39:36,461 --> 00:39:38,985
- Ah, man.

559
00:39:39,028 --> 00:39:41,596
- I'll pay for it.

560
00:39:42,728 --> 00:39:44,730
- Okay. What the hell!

561
00:39:46,949 --> 00:39:48,516
Oh man!

562
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:50,431
Okay, um...

563
00:39:50,475 --> 00:39:53,521
There's this design I saw in a
magazine that I really liked.

564
00:39:53,565 --> 00:39:56,437
The Chinese
character for Truth.

565
00:39:56,481 --> 00:40:00,572
So let's do it right here.
- Alright, sounds good.

566
00:40:03,662 --> 00:40:06,316
Here we go.

567
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:08,188
- You know, it doesn't even
really hurt that much.

568
00:40:08,231 --> 00:40:10,756
- No, nothing compared to
the horror stories you hear.

569
00:40:10,799 --> 00:40:12,888
Or maybe it's 'cause you're
such a big, strong man.

570
00:40:12,932 --> 00:40:15,369
- So, uh, you hungry at all?

571
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:17,371
- Yeah, yeah,
I'm starving.

572
00:40:17,415 --> 00:40:21,070
Guess there's
nothing like scarring your
body to build up an appetite.

573
00:40:21,114 --> 00:40:24,073
- Uh, how about a burger?

574
00:40:24,117 --> 00:40:26,467
- Perfect, that'll
hit the spot.

575
00:40:26,511 --> 00:40:28,861
[Cell phone ringing]
- Just one sec.

576
00:40:28,904 --> 00:40:30,689
- Hello?
- [Scott.]

577
00:40:30,732 --> 00:40:32,473
- Yeah, hi mom.
- [Anything wrong?]

578
00:40:32,517 --> 00:40:34,693
- No no, everything's fine.

579
00:40:34,736 --> 00:40:38,044
Listen, you don't have to make
dinner for me, or Jordan.

580
00:40:38,087 --> 00:40:40,481
- Are you sure?
I defrosted your favorite steaks

581
00:40:40,525 --> 00:40:42,570
from the place you like.
- [No thanks.]

582
00:40:42,614 --> 00:40:45,921
- Yeah, we're gonna grab
something here before
coming back.

583
00:40:45,965 --> 00:40:48,837
- [Alright.]
- Okay, listen, I gotta go.

584
00:40:48,881 --> 00:40:51,100
I'll talk to you later
- [Take care.]

585
00:40:51,144 --> 00:40:53,668
- Okay, bye.

586
00:40:57,150 --> 00:40:59,282
[Laughter]

587
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:04,549
- Hi, honey, how was your day?

588
00:41:04,592 --> 00:41:08,857
- Uh, good. I'm gonna go
lie down, watch a movie
or something.

589
00:41:08,901 --> 00:41:10,816
- Are you feeling okay?

590
00:41:10,859 --> 00:41:13,079
- Yeah. Okay,
good night.

591
00:41:13,122 --> 00:41:15,560
[Phone ringing]

592
00:41:15,603 --> 00:41:19,172
- Uh, would you mind?
- Sure.

593
00:41:19,215 --> 00:41:22,392
- Hello?
- [Is this Kathryn?]

594
00:41:22,436 --> 00:41:24,525
- Oh, no, no it isn't.
Hang on a second.

595
00:41:25,787 --> 00:41:28,224
- Hello?
- Kathryn, it's Ian.
- Hi, Ian.

596
00:41:28,268 --> 00:41:31,140
Jordan, it's Ian.

597
00:41:31,184 --> 00:41:33,186
- Ian, Ian Mathews?

598
00:41:33,229 --> 00:41:37,016
- Oh! Yeah, I didn't
recognize his voice.

599
00:41:37,059 --> 00:41:40,802
- Ian, guess what?
Jordan's here.
- [Wow, really?]

600
00:41:40,846 --> 00:41:42,456
- Yeah, she's staying
with me for a few days.

601
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:45,328
- I'll put her on
when we're done.
- [How you doing?]

602
00:41:45,372 --> 00:41:49,158
- Oh me? You know,
I'm holding up pretty
well, all things considered.

603
00:41:49,202 --> 00:41:52,771
- Scott's about the same,
17-year-old boy, you
know how that is.

604
00:41:52,814 --> 00:41:55,208
- [Good.]
- No, but Jordan,
she's been great.

605
00:41:55,251 --> 00:41:57,340
- [Give her my best.]
- Sure, I know she would
love to see you.

606
00:41:57,384 --> 00:42:00,213
Do you want to talk
to her right now?
- [Sure, put her on.]

607
00:42:00,256 --> 00:42:03,346
- You know what? I am gonna call
him later, my stomach is...

608
00:42:03,390 --> 00:42:05,479
Um, I'll be back.

609
00:42:09,352 --> 00:42:12,921
- Um, she can't talk
right now, I guess.

610
00:42:18,797 --> 00:42:22,452
- Damn you Ian. Brian is dead!

611
00:42:22,496 --> 00:42:25,151
Leave us alone!

612
00:42:27,370 --> 00:42:29,590
- So how's Scott doing?
- Well he and Jordan
are getting along.

613
00:42:29,634 --> 00:42:32,462
They've become instant friends.
- Really?

614
00:42:32,506 --> 00:42:34,682
- They even had dinner
together last night.

615
00:42:34,726 --> 00:42:37,816
- Well, that's better than him
hanging out with that one guy

616
00:42:37,859 --> 00:42:39,992
I suppose. What was his name?
- Jason.

617
00:42:40,035 --> 00:42:42,516
- Right, Jason.
- I can't complain.

618
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:45,171
It's given me some
time to myself

619
00:42:45,214 --> 00:42:47,565
that I didn't even
know I needed really.

620
00:42:47,608 --> 00:42:50,524
- So, when are you coming
back to work fulltime?

621
00:42:50,568 --> 00:42:54,223
I don't want to rush you, but
I do miss seeing you everyday.

622
00:42:54,267 --> 00:42:57,792
- I was thinking
probably Monday.

623
00:42:57,836 --> 00:43:00,273
I think it'll be good
for you to get back.

624
00:43:00,316 --> 00:43:02,318
- It'll help get
my mind off things.

625
00:43:02,362 --> 00:43:04,799
- You know, it does
get better, Kathryn.

626
00:43:04,843 --> 00:43:07,019
I know that sounds
trite at the moment,

627
00:43:07,062 --> 00:43:08,977
but it will get better.

628
00:43:29,215 --> 00:43:31,521
- Blood?

629
00:44:03,292 --> 00:44:06,644
You got a tattoo? Scott,
what were you thinking?

630
00:44:06,687 --> 00:44:10,386
- Mom, honestly, this is
not something to have
a heart attack over.

631
00:44:10,430 --> 00:44:13,694
- It's something you're
gonna regret later.
- That's not true.

632
00:44:13,738 --> 00:44:16,392
- It's not just that. Why didn't
you discuss it with me first?

633
00:44:16,436 --> 00:44:19,744
- Yeah, that
would've been a good idea.
- And second, you lied!

634
00:44:19,787 --> 00:44:23,530
You told me you were going
to dinner instead of what
you were really doing.

635
00:44:23,573 --> 00:44:25,445
- That's not how it happened,
Kathryn, we did go to dinner.

636
00:44:25,488 --> 00:44:28,535
- Well, neither of
you told me about the
tattoo when you got home!

637
00:44:28,578 --> 00:44:31,407
- Well, yeah, that's 'cause
I knew you were gonna
flip out like this!

638
00:44:31,451 --> 00:44:33,671
- Oh, you want me to condone
you getting a tattoo, Scott?

639
00:44:33,714 --> 00:44:35,673
- Mom, Jordan got one too!

640
00:44:35,716 --> 00:44:38,632
You know, the only person
that's acting all psycho
about this is you!

641
00:44:38,676 --> 00:44:42,114
- You got one together?

642
00:44:42,157 --> 00:44:46,858
- Honestly, Kathryn, I don't
know what the big deal is.

643
00:44:46,901 --> 00:44:50,905
I mean they're everywhere.
- He's 17, Jordan!

644
00:44:50,949 --> 00:44:54,169
- I'm sorry. I had not idea
this would start a big fight.

645
00:44:54,213 --> 00:44:58,217
- No. Everything is a fight!
- Scott.

646
00:44:58,260 --> 00:44:59,784
- I'm going to Mike's.

647
00:44:59,827 --> 00:45:02,482
- Scott?
- Forget it!

648
00:45:02,525 --> 00:45:04,440
- I'm sorry, Kathryn.

649
00:45:04,484 --> 00:45:08,227
- I would've appreciated
it if you had discussed

650
00:45:08,270 --> 00:45:10,533
this with me beforehand.

651
00:45:10,577 --> 00:45:15,234
And when I am in a discussion
with my son, keep your
opinions to yourself!

652
00:45:15,277 --> 00:45:16,888
- Of course.

653
00:45:55,013 --> 00:45:58,843
Hey! You're back. Come here.

654
00:46:08,287 --> 00:46:11,681
- I just wanted to apologize for
getting you in trouble before.

655
00:46:11,725 --> 00:46:15,424
- No, that's okay, uh,
don't worry about it.

656
00:46:15,468 --> 00:46:18,210
I knew how she was gonna
react. I shouldn't have
gotten a tattoo.

657
00:46:18,253 --> 00:46:22,214
- Well, since you
guys are both so great,

658
00:46:22,257 --> 00:46:24,782
I hate to see you
upset with each other.

659
00:46:27,741 --> 00:46:30,962
- Well, trust me, the
fighting started a long
time before you showed up.

660
00:46:31,005 --> 00:46:32,224
- Well, still.

661
00:46:32,267 --> 00:46:35,183
If you ever wanna get
anything off your chest,

662
00:46:35,227 --> 00:46:37,577
you know where to find me.

663
00:46:39,274 --> 00:46:40,841
- Thanks.

664
00:46:42,495 --> 00:46:44,323
- I mean that.

665
00:46:44,366 --> 00:46:46,978
I like you a lot.

666
00:46:48,806 --> 00:46:51,417
- I like you too.

667
00:46:53,419 --> 00:46:55,813
- Good night.

668
00:46:58,380 --> 00:46:59,860
- 'Night.

669
00:47:05,561 --> 00:47:08,260
<i>- Scott and I were
growing ever closer now.</i>

670
00:47:08,303 --> 00:47:11,654
<i>And I was just waiting for the
perfect opportunity to arise.</i>

671
00:47:11,698 --> 00:47:13,918
<i>To finally get what I wanted.</i>

672
00:47:20,533 --> 00:47:23,536
- It isn't just her
- Bro, bro. Man, check this out.

673
00:47:23,579 --> 00:47:26,756
Chemically Insane's gonna be at
the Black Fox recording studio
tomorrow night at 9.

674
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:29,324
- And?
- They're recording a new album.

675
00:47:29,368 --> 00:47:31,152
Oh, and did I mention
who their new drummer is?

676
00:47:31,196 --> 00:47:34,068
Jason.
- What?!

677
00:47:34,112 --> 00:47:36,288
- Yeah. I bumped into
him this morning,

678
00:47:36,331 --> 00:47:38,899
he said we could go hang out
at the studio tomorrow night
with all those guys.

679
00:47:38,943 --> 00:47:42,120
- I don't know if I can go.

680
00:47:42,163 --> 00:47:45,688
Me and Jason aren't supposed to
hang out with each other ever
since we go arrested.

681
00:47:45,732 --> 00:47:47,473
- Oh man, come on!

682
00:47:47,516 --> 00:47:49,388
When are we ever gonna get
another chance like this?

683
00:47:49,431 --> 00:47:52,870
- Man, I don't know. My mom's
probably gonna freak out.

684
00:47:52,913 --> 00:47:55,176
And she's already pissed off
about the whole tattoo thing.

685
00:47:55,220 --> 00:47:58,571
- So we leave by 10:45,
you're home by 11. No problem.

686
00:48:02,053 --> 00:48:04,446
- Hmm! Alright, I'll
work something out.

687
00:48:06,709 --> 00:48:09,712
- Clean that up.
- Get out of here.

688
00:48:12,280 --> 00:48:15,066
- So, how is everything
going at Brian's house?

689
00:48:15,109 --> 00:48:19,592
- Well, you know, it's hard.

690
00:48:19,635 --> 00:48:21,855
But I'm working on it.

691
00:48:23,901 --> 00:48:28,122
[Doorbell]
- Ah, that must be Ian.

692
00:48:28,166 --> 00:48:31,038
- Ian?
- Oh, I forgot to tell you.

693
00:48:31,082 --> 00:48:34,041
He called me earlier
to say he was dropping by.

694
00:48:37,479 --> 00:48:39,525
- Damn it!

695
00:48:43,964 --> 00:48:45,966
- [Ian]: Is Jordan around?
I haven't seen her in ages.

696
00:48:46,010 --> 00:48:47,794
- Yeah, she's here
in the kitchen.

697
00:48:47,837 --> 00:48:50,362
Uh, she was in the kitchen.

698
00:48:50,405 --> 00:48:52,277
Jordan?

699
00:48:54,018 --> 00:48:56,150
I don't know where she went.

700
00:49:07,640 --> 00:49:11,339
- Okay, okay, wait. Who said
anything about backing down?

701
00:49:11,383 --> 00:49:14,255
- Mike: [You did, bro.]
- No, I never said
I wasn't gonna go.

702
00:49:14,299 --> 00:49:16,779
- [So what are you
gonna tell your mom?]

703
00:49:16,823 --> 00:49:20,000
- I don't know, I'll tell her
we're going to a movie
or something.

704
00:49:20,044 --> 00:49:21,567
- [Can you hang
with us all night?]

705
00:49:21,610 --> 00:49:23,569
- No, I still have
to be home by curfew.

706
00:49:23,612 --> 00:49:27,007
- [Sure, whatever.]
- No, I need to hear
you say it, Mike.

707
00:49:27,051 --> 00:49:29,923
- [Say what, dude?]
- That I need to be home by 11.

708
00:49:29,967 --> 00:49:32,186
- [Okay, 11 o'clock.]
- Okay.

709
00:49:32,230 --> 00:49:35,320
Um, so I'll look at, you know,

710
00:49:35,363 --> 00:49:38,018
see a movie that
ends around 11.

711
00:49:38,062 --> 00:49:41,282
And I guess
I'll pick you up...

712
00:49:41,326 --> 00:49:43,893
I'll pick you up later.
Okay, I gotta go. Yeah.

713
00:49:43,937 --> 00:49:46,635
- [Catch you later.]
- Alright, later man, bye.

714
00:49:46,679 --> 00:49:49,116
- Hey there.
- Hey!

715
00:49:49,160 --> 00:49:51,814
What movie you guys
going to tonight?

716
00:49:51,858 --> 00:49:53,686
Maybe I can tag along.

717
00:49:56,689 --> 00:49:59,170
- Okay, um,
here's the thing.

718
00:49:59,213 --> 00:50:01,824
You gotta promise not
to say anything to my mom.

719
00:50:01,868 --> 00:50:03,696
- Of course not.

720
00:50:03,739 --> 00:50:05,828
- We're not really
going to a movie.

721
00:50:05,872 --> 00:50:08,048
There's this band
that Mike and I like,

722
00:50:08,092 --> 00:50:12,096
and our friend Jason invited us
to hang out with them tomorrow
night, so.

723
00:50:12,139 --> 00:50:15,447
Jason is the guy that
I got into trouble with.

724
00:50:15,490 --> 00:50:19,103
So I'm not really
supposed to go.

725
00:50:19,146 --> 00:50:22,497
- Don't worry.
I won't say a word.

726
00:50:23,672 --> 00:50:25,544
- Thanks, Jordan.

727
00:50:25,587 --> 00:50:30,027
Uh, maybe you and
I could see a movie...

728
00:50:30,070 --> 00:50:32,029
some other time.

729
00:50:32,072 --> 00:50:34,770
- Sounds good.

730
00:50:34,814 --> 00:50:36,685
<i>That's the good thing
about secret plans.</i>

731
00:50:36,729 --> 00:50:40,080
<i>Sometimes you have
to rely on other people</i>

732
00:50:40,124 --> 00:50:42,387
<i>to keep them a secret.</i>

733
00:50:45,868 --> 00:50:49,220
- Jordan. What happened
to you last night?
- What do you mean?

734
00:50:49,263 --> 00:50:52,092
- Well, Ian was here and
he wanted to say "hi".

735
00:50:52,136 --> 00:50:53,528
And we couldn't find
you anywhere.

736
00:50:53,572 --> 00:50:56,053
- Oh, umm...

737
00:50:56,096 --> 00:50:59,404
Well, to tell you the truth,
I just couldn't face him.

738
00:50:59,447 --> 00:51:01,449
You know, whenever
I see somebody that
knew Brian really well,

739
00:51:01,493 --> 00:51:03,277
it just makes
me want to cry.

740
00:51:03,321 --> 00:51:06,324
It's so draining.
- 'Morning.

741
00:51:06,367 --> 00:51:08,500
- Hi, honey.

742
00:51:08,543 --> 00:51:10,806
- Mom. Jordan.

743
00:51:10,850 --> 00:51:13,679
- Today's your day off, right?
- Yeah.

744
00:51:13,722 --> 00:51:15,507
- Any big plans?

745
00:51:15,550 --> 00:51:18,640
- I'm gonna go see a movie
with Mike probably,

746
00:51:18,684 --> 00:51:20,816
but other than that, no.
- What about you, Jordan?

747
00:51:20,860 --> 00:51:25,517
- I'm gonna go up to Brian's
and finish up, you know.

748
00:51:25,560 --> 00:51:27,997
- Well, I have late meetings.

749
00:51:28,041 --> 00:51:31,392
So, I'll be home around nine.
Enjoy your movie, honey.

750
00:51:31,436 --> 00:51:33,742
- Yeah, okay.
- Bye.

751
00:51:33,786 --> 00:51:37,137
Hey, Scott, would you be
available any time this weekend

752
00:51:37,181 --> 00:51:40,097
to come up to Brian's cabin
and help me finish packing
up his stuff?

753
00:51:40,140 --> 00:51:42,055
I decided I'm gonna sell it.

754
00:51:42,099 --> 00:51:44,971
- Um, no, sorry,
Jordan, I can't.

755
00:51:45,014 --> 00:51:47,234
My probation officer, he won't
let me leave the county.

756
00:51:47,278 --> 00:51:50,150
- Oh, I'm sorry. No,
I completely forgot.

757
00:51:50,194 --> 00:51:52,500
- Do you want me to ask Mike?

758
00:51:52,544 --> 00:51:54,676
If, you know, he could
come and help you out.

759
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:57,201
- No, no, that's okay.
I'll find somebody.

760
00:51:57,244 --> 00:51:59,159
So have fun tonight.

761
00:51:59,203 --> 00:52:01,596
It'll stay our
little secret.

762
00:52:48,687 --> 00:52:53,257
[Laughter and talking]

763
00:52:53,300 --> 00:52:55,955
- You guys sound as good
live as you do on disk.

764
00:52:55,998 --> 00:52:58,827
- And I told you so! And could
you believe that guitar solo?

765
00:52:58,871 --> 00:53:00,960
- Ah, tight!
- You wanna pass me a beer, bro?

766
00:53:01,003 --> 00:53:03,441
- Sure. Scott?
- Just a pop for me, man.

767
00:53:03,484 --> 00:53:05,530
- Hey, what's the deal
with your P.O?

768
00:53:05,573 --> 00:53:07,358
I heard he's a
real hard ass.

769
00:53:07,401 --> 00:53:10,317
- Yeah, you know.
- I got so lucky!

770
00:53:10,361 --> 00:53:13,799
The chick I have, she doesn't
care what I do, as long I
don't get arrested again.

771
00:53:13,842 --> 00:53:15,714
- That's... That's... Dude!

772
00:53:15,757 --> 00:53:19,065
I don't know how you do it!
- Ah, well, you know!

773
00:54:15,556 --> 00:54:18,080
- Yeah, it's a nice one. You did
a good job filling it in.

774
00:54:18,124 --> 00:54:20,126
Hey man, we're ready
to rehearse again.

775
00:54:20,169 --> 00:54:22,911
- Oh, hey listen, I gotta
get going. But thanks
for having us, man.

776
00:54:22,955 --> 00:54:25,697
- Anytime, bro.
[Guitar playing]

777
00:54:25,740 --> 00:54:27,786
- Hey, you're ready to go?

778
00:54:27,829 --> 00:54:29,875
- I actually might hang
around a little bit longer.

779
00:54:29,918 --> 00:54:32,660
Jason will drive me home.
- Alright, cool.

780
00:54:32,704 --> 00:54:34,923
Later, bro.
- Bro.

781

[Engine not starting]

782
00:54:52,985 --> 00:54:55,292

- Hey, Scott.

786
00:55:26,932 --> 00:55:29,500
- [Hey, Jordan, where are you?]

787
00:55:29,543 --> 00:55:31,676
- Just driving back
from Brian's, why?

788
00:55:31,719 --> 00:55:36,811
- [Uh. I'm in a bit of trouble.
I could use your help.]

789
00:55:36,855 --> 00:55:40,424
[My car won't start. I think
maybe my battery's dead
or something.]

790
00:55:40,467 --> 00:55:42,513
- Don't worry about a thing.

791
00:55:42,556 --> 00:55:45,124
I'll be there to pick you up.
Just give me the address.

792
00:55:45,167 --> 00:55:47,996
- 2213 Baker Street.

793
00:55:48,040 --> 00:55:50,695
In the parking lot
behind the building.

794
00:55:50,738 --> 00:55:52,653
- Ten minutes.

795
00:55:52,697 --> 00:55:55,743
- Okay. Thanks, Jordan,
I owe you one.

796
00:55:58,572 --> 00:56:00,444
- Yes, you do.

797
00:56:02,794 --> 00:56:06,798
- Police radio: [Unit 52.
We have a report of suspicious
activity in a parking lot]

[at Baker and High Tower.
White teenage male.]

799
00:56:09,627 --> 00:56:10,758
[Possible auto theft.]

800
00:56:10,802 --> 00:56:14,414
- This is Unit 52.
I'll check it out.

00:56:31,126 --> 00:56:33,433
[Phone ringing]

802
00:56:33,477 --> 00:56:35,522
- Hello.

00:56:35,566 --> 00:56:38,917
- Hey, mom?
- Scott, where are you?

804
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:40,919
- [Uh, I'm at Mike's.]

805
00:56:40,962 --> 00:56:45,576
Um, listen, his neighbor,
somebody, blocked my car
in the driveway, so...

806
00:56:45,619 --> 00:56:49,318
We're trying to find them, but
it could take a little while.

807
00:56:49,362 --> 00:56:51,625
- Okay. Do you want me
to come pick you up?

808
00:56:51,669 --> 00:56:53,975
[We can get your car
in the morning?]
- No, that's okay.

809
00:56:54,019 --> 00:56:56,151
- I think Mike's brother is
gonna give me a ride home,

810
00:56:56,195 --> 00:57:00,721
So I'm just calling
to let you know that it
might take a little bit longer.

811
00:57:00,765 --> 00:57:04,377
- Okay, well just get
home soon, okay?

812

from the car please.]

- Whose car is this?

816
00:57:22,395 --> 00:57:25,224
- Uh, it's mine. I'm just having
trouble getting it started.

817
00:57:25,267 --> 00:57:26,834
- Can I see your license
and registration, please?

818
00:57:32,666 --> 00:57:35,016
- One sec, my registration's
in the car.

819
00:57:43,590 --> 00:57:45,636
- Okay, have a seat in the car.

820
00:57:53,644 --> 00:57:55,733
- Damn it.

821
00:57:55,776 --> 00:57:58,605
<i>Well this certainly
wasn't part of the plan.</i>

822
00:57:58,649 --> 00:58:01,608
<i>But I can see it making
things turn out even better.</i>

823
00:58:08,136 --> 00:58:09,964
- Come over here, please.

824
00:58:13,141 --> 00:58:14,882
- Scott, what's going on?
- Who are you?

825
00:58:14,926 --> 00:58:17,668
- Uh, Jordan. A friend.

826
00:58:17,711 --> 00:58:20,540
He called for a ride
when his car broke down.

827
00:58:20,584 --> 00:58:23,108
- Listen, Officer, he hasn't
done anything wrong.

828
00:58:23,151 --> 00:58:26,154
- Relax, lady. We got a call
that someone was breaking
into a car here.

829
00:58:26,198 --> 00:58:27,895
- This is his car!

830
00:58:27,939 --> 00:58:31,812
- You're on probation. For
vandalism and stealing a car.

831
00:58:31,856 --> 00:58:33,510
- But Officer, he hasn't
done anything wrong.

832
00:58:33,553 --> 00:58:35,468
- He's in violation
of his curfew.

833
00:58:35,512 --> 00:58:37,209
- I have extended
curfew because I work.

834
00:58:37,252 --> 00:58:39,080
- Look, we'll go
to the station, we'll
take care of it from there.

835
00:58:39,124 --> 00:58:41,561
- Jordan!

836
00:58:41,605 --> 00:58:43,737
- I'm taking him
to the Hoover station.

837
00:58:43,781 --> 00:58:45,652
Tell his parents to meet
him there. Let's go.

838
00:58:46,348 --> 00:58:48,133
[Sighs]

839
00:59:02,539 --> 00:59:06,325
[Phone ringing]
- Hello.

840
00:59:06,368 --> 00:59:09,067
- Kathryn, hi.
It's Jordan.

841
00:59:09,110 --> 00:59:11,765
Listen, I don't know how
to tell you this, but...

842
00:59:11,809 --> 00:59:14,463
Scott's on his way downtown.
He's been arrested.

843
00:59:14,507 --> 00:59:18,772
- What?!
- Um, yeah. It's
just a misunderstanding.]

844
00:59:18,816 --> 00:59:21,862
His car broke down. And I was
on my way to pick up him up,

845
00:59:21,906 --> 00:59:24,604
and someone must have thought
that he was trying to
steal the car

846
00:59:24,648 --> 00:59:26,998
[and called the cops,
I don't really know.]

847
00:59:27,041 --> 00:59:30,044
- I don't understand.
I just talked to Scott.
He's at Mike's house.

848
00:59:30,088 --> 00:59:34,222
- Uh, yeah. Well,
he's not with Mike.

849
00:59:34,266 --> 00:59:36,311
He was in a parking lot
on Baker Street.

850
00:59:36,355 --> 00:59:40,446
And, look, I was just
coming to get him, and, and..

851
00:59:40,489 --> 00:59:42,579
[the cops were already
here when I arrived.]

852
00:59:42,622 --> 00:59:44,363
- Oh, my God. Where did
they take him?

853
00:59:44,406 --> 00:59:46,583
- Hoover Street station.

854
00:59:46,626 --> 00:59:50,064
Do you want me
to meet you there?
- No, I'll handle this myself.

855
01:00:20,965 --> 01:00:22,923
Can I speak with you?

856
01:00:22,967 --> 01:00:25,012
Jordan, this situation
isn't working out anymore.

857
01:00:25,056 --> 01:00:27,362
- What do you mean?

858
01:00:27,406 --> 01:00:30,757
- I made it very clear to
you that I didn't want you
interfering with my son.

859
01:00:30,801 --> 01:00:32,454
And what's the first
thing you do?

860
01:00:32,498 --> 01:00:35,501
You pick him up from somewhere
he isn't even supposed to be.

861
01:00:35,544 --> 01:00:39,113
So I don't catch him in a lie.
- Kathryn...

862
01:00:39,157 --> 01:00:41,594
I was just trying to help.
I mean, I didn't think that...

863
01:00:41,638 --> 01:00:43,901
- Mom, don't talk
to her that way.

864
01:00:43,944 --> 01:00:46,599
- Go upstairs to your room.
- Mom, the only reason
Jordan got involved

865
01:00:46,643 --> 01:00:48,122
was because I called her.

866
01:00:50,603 --> 01:00:52,736
- That's not the point.

867
01:00:52,779 --> 01:00:56,304
This thing you two
have between you.

868
01:00:56,348 --> 01:00:59,438
Whatever it is.
It needs to stop.
[Breathing hard]

869
01:00:59,481 --> 01:01:02,702
- Jordan, I want
you out by tomorrow.
- What? Mom, what "thing"?

870
01:01:02,746 --> 01:01:06,706
- What are you talking about?
- Oh, you know exactly
what I'm talking about.

871
01:01:06,750 --> 01:01:10,449
- No, Mom! You know what it is?
You're just jealous.

872
01:01:10,492 --> 01:01:12,712
You're kicking her out
because you're jealous.

873
01:01:12,756 --> 01:01:16,847
You're jealous that she's cool,
and fun, and easy to talk
to and you're not!

874
01:01:16,890 --> 01:01:20,546
- Scott, go to your room!
- You just hate the idea
of me having any friends.

875
01:01:20,589 --> 01:01:23,897
- Kathryn, please.
Can't we talk about this?

876
01:01:23,941 --> 01:01:26,117
- You can find a hotel.

877
01:01:26,160 --> 01:01:28,293
[Gasps]

878
01:01:28,336 --> 01:01:30,948
- Mom...

879
01:01:30,991 --> 01:01:33,733
I hate you.

880
01:01:47,051 --> 01:01:49,096
[Crying]

881
01:01:49,140 --> 01:01:51,359
- No, hey, come on.
Jordan, please don't cry.

882
01:01:51,403 --> 01:01:54,014
Look, I'm really sorry
about all of this.

883
01:01:54,058 --> 01:01:57,017
- I just don't know
what I did wrong!

884
01:01:57,061 --> 01:01:59,150
- No, you didn't
do anything wrong.

885
01:01:59,193 --> 01:02:01,152
It's just, this
is just not fair.

886
01:02:01,195 --> 01:02:02,980
- I'm not gonna stay here if
she doesn't want me to stay.

887
01:02:03,023 --> 01:02:05,156
Look, Kathryn, I will go, okay?

888
01:02:05,199 --> 01:02:08,333
Tomorrow, I will pack my things
and I will go stay in
Brian's cabin.

889
01:02:08,376 --> 01:02:10,248
- Thank you, Jordan

890
01:02:21,694 --> 01:02:24,088
Scott.

891
01:02:24,131 --> 01:02:26,090
- Leave me alone.

892
01:02:47,285 --> 01:02:50,418
- Did you remember
you have an appointment
with Officer Kingman today?

893
01:02:50,462 --> 01:02:52,290
- Yes.
- How are you gonna get there?

894
01:02:52,333 --> 01:02:55,902
Your car's still downtown.
- I'll take the bus.

895
01:03:20,405 --> 01:03:23,147
- Scott!

896
01:03:23,190 --> 01:03:25,540
Hey.

897
01:03:27,978 --> 01:03:30,719
- Did I, um, did
I just overhear your mom

898
01:03:30,763 --> 01:03:33,287
saying you had an appointment
with your probation officer?

899
01:03:33,331 --> 01:03:36,203
- Yeah, he's gonna
be thrilled to death

900
01:03:36,247 --> 01:03:38,858
about what happened
last night.

901
01:03:38,902 --> 01:03:40,729
- Seriously, Scott, you did
nothing wrong last night.

902
01:03:40,773 --> 01:03:42,949
You know, why don't you
let me go with you,

903
01:03:42,993 --> 01:03:44,908
and I can try to help
explain it to him.

904
01:03:44,951 --> 01:03:47,432
I can give you a ride, and
then afterwards, you
can go get your car.

905
01:03:47,475 --> 01:03:49,564
- Are you sure?

906
01:03:49,608 --> 01:03:53,046
- Yeah. I mean, what happened
to you last night was
totally unfair.

907
01:03:53,090 --> 01:03:57,964
I was there, I saw it.
- Okay. Yeah. Um...

908
01:03:58,008 --> 01:04:00,880
My appointment's in an hour.
- Okay.

909
01:04:00,924 --> 01:04:02,142
Let's hop in the car.

910
01:04:07,060 --> 01:04:08,757
- I appreciate what
you're saying, Miss Hagan

911
01:04:08,801 --> 01:04:10,890
but this isn't about curfew.

912
01:04:10,934 --> 01:04:14,024
The problem with the car, being
late, I understand all that.

913
01:04:14,067 --> 01:04:18,028
What you don't seem to
understand is that the judge
made it perfectly clear

914
01:04:18,071 --> 01:04:20,247
that he was to have
no contact with Jason.

915
01:04:23,076 --> 01:04:24,817
- I know you're
just trying to help.

916
01:04:24,861 --> 01:04:26,863
But there's more
to it than that.

917
01:04:26,906 --> 01:04:30,170
Thank you for coming in.

918
01:04:30,214 --> 01:04:33,913
But I need to speak
to Scott. Alone.

919
01:04:35,872 --> 01:04:37,569
- Okay.

920
01:04:49,189 --> 01:04:51,017
- I really don't think
you take this seriously.

921
01:04:51,061 --> 01:04:53,063
- Yes, I am. Okay, look.

922
01:04:53,106 --> 01:04:55,152
This wasn't about
going to see Jason.

923
01:04:55,195 --> 01:04:57,154
I just wanted to meet the guys
in the band, that's all!

924
01:04:57,197 --> 01:05:00,809
- You listen, Scott. One more
screw up like this and...

925
01:05:02,986 --> 01:05:05,118
And I make it official.
- What? Come on.

926
01:05:05,162 --> 01:05:07,207
- Straighten up, Scott!

927
01:05:13,257 --> 01:05:15,085
- I'm really sorry, Scott.

928
01:05:15,128 --> 01:05:18,915
- Don't worry. I mean,
you tried to help.

929
01:05:18,958 --> 01:05:22,005
That was very cool of you.

930
01:05:22,048 --> 01:05:24,442
- You would've done
the same thing for me.

931
01:05:24,485 --> 01:05:26,923
- Of course.

932
01:05:29,055 --> 01:05:30,970
- Sure I can't take
you to your car?

933
01:05:31,014 --> 01:05:33,842
- Nah, it's just
around the corner.

934
01:05:59,216 --> 01:06:02,045
- Keep in touch, okay?

935
01:06:02,088 --> 01:06:04,134
- Yeah.

936
01:06:06,571 --> 01:06:09,052
Hey, Jordan.

937
01:06:09,095 --> 01:06:11,184
Thank you.

938
01:07:15,248 --> 01:07:17,511
[Struggling]

939
01:07:41,927 --> 01:07:44,582
[Cell phone ringing]

940
01:07:46,453 --> 01:07:48,890
- Hello?
- Scott.

941
01:07:48,934 --> 01:07:52,677
I am so glad to get you.
It's Jordan.

942
01:07:52,720 --> 01:07:54,592
- Jordan. Hey, what's wrong?

943
01:07:54,635 --> 01:07:58,117
- Um, I'm really sorry
to call you at work. Um...

944
01:07:58,161 --> 01:08:02,121
[I need your help. And
I didn't know who else to call.]

945
01:08:02,165 --> 01:08:05,124
- Okay, tell me, what happened?

946
01:08:05,168 --> 01:08:07,170
- Well, I stopped at the store

947
01:08:07,213 --> 01:08:09,259
to get some boxes to pack
up Brian's stuff.

948
01:08:09,302 --> 01:08:12,653
And I think somebody stole
my wallet, or I lost it.

949
01:08:12,697 --> 01:08:16,788
I don't know. But I don't have
any money or credit cards,

950
01:08:16,831 --> 01:08:19,965
[or anything!]
- Okay, just calm down.

951
01:08:20,008 --> 01:08:22,141
[Calm down. Where are you?]

952
01:08:22,185 --> 01:08:25,144
- I'm at the cabin. And...

953
01:08:25,188 --> 01:08:28,321
[The SUV is almost out of gas,
and I don't know what to do.]

954
01:08:28,365 --> 01:08:31,846
- Can you call the auto club?

955
01:08:31,890 --> 01:08:35,633
- No. You have to be a member.
And have a card, and...

956
01:08:35,676 --> 01:08:37,722
My wallet, Scott.

957
01:08:37,765 --> 01:08:39,767
[My wallet is gone.]

958
01:08:39,811 --> 01:08:42,379
- Okay. Just let me
think for a second.

959
01:08:42,422 --> 01:08:45,208
- [Scott, can you
come and get me?]

960
01:08:45,251 --> 01:08:47,384
[I mean, you're
the only one I know.]

961
01:08:47,427 --> 01:08:50,996
- Jordan. I can't. I mean...

962
01:08:51,039 --> 01:08:54,608
I'm at work. And I'm not
supposed to go that far out.

963
01:08:54,652 --> 01:08:57,959
[Scott, please? I need help.]

964
01:08:59,874 --> 01:09:03,226
- Okay. I'll see if I can
switch shifts with someone.

965
01:09:03,269 --> 01:09:05,315
And then I'll come get you.

966
01:09:05,358 --> 01:09:07,926
- Thank you, Scott.

967
01:09:07,969 --> 01:09:09,797
I knew I could count on you.

968
01:09:09,841 --> 01:09:13,671
- Listen, just sit tight, and
I'll be there in an hour or so.

969
01:09:13,714 --> 01:09:15,499
- [Okay. Thanks.]

970
01:09:19,372 --> 01:09:21,244
- Hey Mike?
- [Yeah.]

971
01:09:21,287 --> 01:09:23,420
- Hey, what's up, man?
It's Scott.

972
01:09:23,463 --> 01:09:26,814
- [Hey, dude.]
- Listen. I need you
to do me a big favor.

973
01:10:23,915 --> 01:10:26,483
- [Thanks, Kathryn.
We'll continue to work
on it from our end]

974
01:10:26,526 --> 01:10:28,398
[and submit the budget
to you next week.]

975
01:10:28,441 --> 01:10:31,662
- Great, thank you.
- [Talk soon. Bye.]

976
01:10:31,705 --> 01:10:34,665
- Scott...

977
01:10:43,369 --> 01:10:46,503
<i>- The mobile unit you
are trying to reach is
out of this service area.</i>

978
01:10:46,546 --> 01:10:49,070
<i>Please try your
call again later.</i>

979
01:10:49,114 --> 01:10:51,421
- "Out of this service area"?

980
01:10:56,077 --> 01:10:58,297
[Ringing]

981
01:10:58,341 --> 01:11:00,734
- Jitters Coffee Café,
this is Mike.

982
01:11:00,778 --> 01:11:02,997
- Hi, Mike, this
is Scott's mother.

983
01:11:03,041 --> 01:11:06,566
May I speak with him please?
- Uh, he's...

984
01:11:06,610 --> 01:11:09,003
Uh, he left early.

985
01:11:09,047 --> 01:11:11,963
- Early why?
- [I don't know.]

986
01:11:12,006 --> 01:11:14,400
He just called me and
asked me to switch shifts.

987
01:11:14,444 --> 01:11:16,620
- And he didn't
give you a reason?

988
01:11:16,663 --> 01:11:20,319
- Just that he was helping
someone move, but...

989
01:11:20,363 --> 01:11:22,930
- Who? Jordan?

990
01:11:22,974 --> 01:11:26,325
- Uh... He didn't say exactly.

991
01:11:29,763 --> 01:11:33,114
- Gas is working.

992
01:11:35,073 --> 01:11:37,249
Alright then.

993
01:11:37,293 --> 01:11:39,643
[Phone ringing]

994
01:11:46,040 --> 01:11:48,826
- Hello?
- Hello Jordan, this is Kathryn.

995
01:11:48,869 --> 01:11:51,916
I'm just calling because
I really need to get
a hold of Scott.

996
01:11:51,959 --> 01:11:54,353
- Oh, well I'm sorry, Kathryn,

997
01:11:54,397 --> 01:11:56,399
But there's no reason
he'd be here.

998
01:11:58,401 --> 01:12:01,360
- No. I was just wondering if
you knew where he could be.

999
01:12:01,404 --> 01:12:04,407
- No, I don't. Not at all.

1000
01:12:04,450 --> 01:12:06,496
- Oh, well thank you.

1001
01:12:06,539 --> 01:12:09,281
If you do happen to hear from
him, will you please have
him call me?

1002
01:12:09,325 --> 01:12:13,329
- I sure will, Kathryn. Bye.
- [Bye.]

1003
01:12:18,377 --> 01:12:20,945
[Knocking]
- Kathryn. Is something wrong?

1004
01:12:20,988 --> 01:12:24,905
- I don't know. I can't
find Scott anywhere.

1005
01:12:24,949 --> 01:12:27,560
I called the coffee shop and
they said he left to help
somebody move,

1006
01:12:27,604 --> 01:12:29,562
which made me think of
Jordan, about the cabin.

1007
01:12:29,606 --> 01:12:31,999
But she says she hasn't
heard from him.

1008
01:12:32,043 --> 01:12:34,959
- Well, he's not on his cell?
- The message says

1009
01:12:35,002 --> 01:12:37,788
it's out of range, which again
made me think of the cabin.

1010
01:12:37,831 --> 01:12:40,921
- And you sound like you
don't believe Jordan.

1011
01:12:40,965 --> 01:12:43,794
Well, she does know that
he can't leave the city
because of his probation.

1012
01:12:43,837 --> 01:12:47,928
- She knows. But she also knew
about his curfew too, and...

1013
01:12:47,972 --> 01:12:50,322
In fact, every time Scott's
been in trouble lately,

1014
01:12:50,366 --> 01:12:52,455
she seems to be right there.

1015
01:12:52,498 --> 01:12:55,806
- You'd think having her move
out of your home would
be enough.

1016
01:12:55,849 --> 01:12:58,330
- Well, she wasn't necessarily
overjoyed about that.

1017
01:12:58,374 --> 01:13:02,508
You know what? I'm just gonna
go up there and see for myself.

1018
01:13:02,552 --> 01:13:04,510
- That's a long way
to drive on a hunch.

1019
01:13:04,554 --> 01:13:07,252
And we've been waiting for that
meeting today for six months.

1020
01:13:07,295 --> 01:13:09,385
- Tell Dean Smith I had
a family emergency.

1021
01:13:09,428 --> 01:13:11,909
But the absolute minute
you find out his decision

1022
01:13:11,952 --> 01:13:13,824
on the new budget proposals,
please call me. Promise?

1023
01:13:13,867 --> 01:13:17,610
- Sure. But you said cell
phones don't work up there.

1024
01:13:17,654 --> 01:13:22,310
- Right. Here is the
landline to the cabin.

1025
01:13:22,354 --> 01:13:24,704
Call me here.

1026
01:13:24,748 --> 01:13:26,924
Okay.

1027
01:13:29,492 --> 01:13:31,624
Thank you.

1028
01:13:50,513 --> 01:13:54,517
- Hello? Jordan?
- Scott! Hi!

1029
01:13:54,560 --> 01:13:56,649
Oh, my God, I'm so
glad to see you.

1030
01:13:56,693 --> 01:13:59,522
- Don't worry about it.
Everything's gonna be okay.

1031
01:13:59,565 --> 01:14:01,611
- Oh, I'm sorry, I hope I didn't
get you in any trouble.

1032
01:14:01,654 --> 01:14:04,352
I just didn't know who
else to call.
- No, listen.

1033
01:14:04,396 --> 01:14:07,965
Nobody's gonna find out. And
besides, it's the least
I could do for you.

1034
01:14:08,008 --> 01:14:10,054
after everything
you've done for me.

1035
01:14:10,097 --> 01:14:12,665
So, umm...

1036
01:14:12,709 --> 01:14:15,059
You wanna follow me to
the gas station in the SUV?

1037
01:14:15,102 --> 01:14:17,061
I got some cash and
we can fill it up.

1038
01:14:17,104 --> 01:14:20,151
- That's great. That's amazing.

1039
01:14:20,194 --> 01:14:22,675
You know what? Could you just
help me a bit? I gotta get
all of this stuff

1040
01:14:22,719 --> 01:14:24,982
packed up and that picture
is way too big.

1041
01:14:25,025 --> 01:14:27,506
I need help with that.
So, what do you think?

1042
01:14:27,550 --> 01:14:30,248
- Well, I don't have
to be back for a little while.

1043
01:14:30,291 --> 01:14:33,164
Couple of hours, so.
- Great. Great.

1044
01:14:33,207 --> 01:14:35,514
Well I'm exhausted,
I'm gonna fall over.

1045
01:14:35,558 --> 01:14:38,648
So I'm gonna get us some
coffee. If you could get
started on the knick knacks,

1046
01:14:38,691 --> 01:14:40,693
that would be great. What
do you take in your coffee?

1047
01:14:40,737 --> 01:14:43,479
- Two sugars.
- Okay.

1048
01:15:20,820 --> 01:15:23,040
Here you go.
- Oh, thanks.

1049
01:15:25,172 --> 01:15:27,261
So, what are you gonna
do with all this stuff?

1050
01:15:27,305 --> 01:15:30,830
- Oh, I'm gonna
donate most of it.

1051
01:15:30,874 --> 01:15:33,659
Just keep a couple of things
that remind me of Brian.

1052
01:15:56,639 --> 01:15:59,555
Scott, can you hold this for me?
- Yeah.

1053
01:16:06,083 --> 01:16:08,041
- Scott?

1054
01:16:10,827 --> 01:16:13,525
Scott? You okay?

1055
01:16:13,569 --> 01:16:16,963
- What? Yeah, I don't
know. I just...

1056
01:16:17,007 --> 01:16:19,749
I'm just like really really
tired all of a sudden.

1057
01:16:19,792 --> 01:16:21,664
It just hit me.

1058
01:16:26,930 --> 01:16:29,628
- Scott!
[Scott groaning]

1059
01:16:29,672 --> 01:16:31,891
Scott are you okay?
- Yeah...

1060
01:16:31,935 --> 01:16:34,241
No, I...

1061
01:16:34,285 --> 01:16:36,504
I don't think so...

1062
01:16:36,548 --> 01:16:38,637
I don't know.

1063
01:16:44,382 --> 01:16:47,907
- Don't fight it. Just
let yourself fall asleep.

1064
01:16:51,694 --> 01:16:54,610
Just relax. It'll all
be over soon.

1065
01:16:54,653 --> 01:16:57,743
- What?

1066
01:16:57,787 --> 01:17:02,313
- Don't worry. You'll be asleep.
You won't feel a thing.

1067
01:17:04,968 --> 01:17:06,970
I'm sorry.

1068
01:17:07,013 --> 01:17:10,060
You're really
an innocent victim.

1069
01:17:10,103 --> 01:17:13,803
Victim of people
like your mother.

1070
01:17:13,846 --> 01:17:18,285
Who don't care if they ruin
other people's lives.

1071
01:17:18,329 --> 01:17:21,854
See, Scott, Brian
and I were in love.

1072
01:17:21,898 --> 01:17:25,336
We were soul mates.

1073
01:17:27,381 --> 01:17:30,820
We were gonna be married till
your mother took him from me.

1074
01:17:30,863 --> 01:17:33,474
Now that old gas line
in there is gonna leak.

1075
01:17:33,518 --> 01:17:35,520
They'll be an explosion
and a fire.

1076
01:17:35,563 --> 01:17:38,654
The final part of my plan.

1077
01:17:38,697 --> 01:17:41,178
To right the wrong
your mother did to me.

1078
01:17:41,221 --> 01:17:43,397
Like I said, don't worry.

1079
01:17:43,441 --> 01:17:45,573
You'll be asleep.

1080
01:17:45,617 --> 01:17:48,098
You won't feel a thing.

1081
01:17:50,187 --> 01:17:53,364
First, I have to move
your body into the den.

1082
01:17:53,407 --> 01:17:57,324
So your remains are
found next to Jordan's.

1083
01:17:59,631 --> 01:18:01,415
- [Whispering]: Jordan...?

1084
01:18:01,459 --> 01:18:03,417
- That's right.

1085
01:18:03,461 --> 01:18:08,727
The DNA will show that
you really died next
to the real Jordan.

1086
01:18:08,771 --> 01:18:12,078
Which won't come
as any surprise.

1087
01:18:12,122 --> 01:18:16,039
Since you had a crush
on her. Or me.

1088
01:18:16,082 --> 01:18:17,997
Didn't you?

1089
01:18:18,041 --> 01:18:20,826
Don't worry.

1090
01:18:20,870 --> 01:18:23,394
You'll be gone in a few minutes.

1091
01:18:53,206 --> 01:18:55,948
- [Kathryn]: Scott? Jordan?

1092
01:18:58,777 --> 01:19:00,910
Scott? Jordan, what's
wrong with him?

1093
01:19:00,953 --> 01:19:03,347
- I don't know!
I don't know! He's sick.

1094
01:19:03,390 --> 01:19:05,653
I went to the bathroom to look
for something to give him but...

1095
01:19:05,697 --> 01:19:08,787
- Scott, honey. Scott.
What's wrong?
- Mom...

1096
01:19:08,831 --> 01:19:12,095
- He said he wasn't feeling
well. And then he just
fell into this chair.

1097
01:19:12,138 --> 01:19:14,924
[Scott mumbling]
- I don't know
what's happening here.

1098
01:19:14,967 --> 01:19:17,317
I'm gonna call 911.

1099
01:19:19,145 --> 01:19:21,104
- Sorry, Kathryn.

1100
01:19:21,147 --> 01:19:23,280
I'm afraid I can't
let you do that.

1101
01:19:23,323 --> 01:19:26,587
What the hell are you doing?

1102
01:19:26,631 --> 01:19:29,112
- Well, this wasn't really
part of the plan, but now
that you're here,

1103
01:19:29,155 --> 01:19:32,768
I guess you'll just have
to suffer the same fate
as your son.

1104
01:19:32,811 --> 01:19:35,118
- Jordan, what are
you talking about?

1105
01:19:35,161 --> 01:19:37,163
- Well, for starters...

1106
01:19:37,207 --> 01:19:41,341
It's not Jordan. It's Allison.

1107
01:19:41,385 --> 01:19:45,781
Allison? The same Allison
you stole Brian from?

1108
01:19:45,824 --> 01:19:50,263
The same one you called
"the crazy woman" that
he dated before you.

1109
01:19:50,307 --> 01:19:53,919
- Oh, my God. What did
you do to my son?

1110
01:19:56,530 --> 01:19:58,402
- He's just sleeping.

1111
01:20:00,578 --> 01:20:04,147
You have no idea the time and
effort that I have put
into all of this.

1112
01:20:04,190 --> 01:20:06,062
- All of what?

1113
01:20:06,105 --> 01:20:08,847
- Well, getting close
to you and Scott.

1114
01:20:08,891 --> 01:20:10,936
Of course Jordan was the key.

1115
01:20:10,980 --> 01:20:13,504
- The key to what?

1116
01:20:13,547 --> 01:20:16,463
- I knew that if you lost Scott,

1117
01:20:16,507 --> 01:20:19,640
you would feel the same
pain that I felt

1118
01:20:19,684 --> 01:20:21,599
when you took Brian from me.

1119
01:20:21,642 --> 01:20:24,167
- That is not true.

1120
01:20:24,210 --> 01:20:27,431
Allison, look. I know
that you're mad at me.

1121
01:20:27,474 --> 01:20:29,781
That's fine. But, please, Scott
has nothing to do with this!

1122
01:20:29,825 --> 01:20:31,739
Please let me help him!

1123
01:20:31,783 --> 01:20:35,047
- No, you were supposed
to live without Scott.

1124
01:20:35,091 --> 01:20:39,791
The same way you made me
live without Brian.

1125
01:20:41,837 --> 01:20:43,882
But now I guess you just
don't get to live at all.

1126
01:20:45,841 --> 01:20:48,887
Scott's body was supposed to be
found here next to Jordan's.

1127
01:20:48,931 --> 01:20:54,197
And now, there's just gonna
have to be three bodies.

1128
01:20:54,240 --> 01:20:58,027
Instead of two.
[Phone ringing]

1129
01:21:00,464 --> 01:21:03,249
[Phone ringing]
[Gunshot]

1130
01:21:03,293 --> 01:21:06,296
[Struggling]
- Ah!

1131
01:21:20,353 --> 01:21:22,878
I love you.

1132
01:21:30,755 --> 01:21:33,845
I knew it.

1133
01:21:33,889 --> 01:21:36,326
Dad, where are you going?

1134
01:21:38,894 --> 01:21:41,374
- Allison.

1135
01:21:41,418 --> 01:21:44,029
- Dad!

1136
01:21:52,559 --> 01:21:54,474
- Allison?

1137
01:22:00,654 --> 01:22:01,960
Ah!

1138
01:22:19,021 --> 01:22:21,719
[Dialing]

1139
01:22:21,762 --> 01:22:24,330
- [911, what's your emergency?]

1140
01:22:24,374 --> 01:22:27,899
- Yes, hello! I'm calling from
a cabin on Avarench Road.

1141
01:22:27,943 --> 01:22:31,033
There's been a shooting and
we need help right away.

1142
01:22:58,930 --> 01:23:01,933
- Hey!
- Hi, honey.

1143
01:23:01,977 --> 01:23:03,935
- So you said you'd
be here at one.

1144
01:23:03,979 --> 01:23:05,981
- And it's quarter after.

1145
01:23:06,024 --> 01:23:09,114
- You're late. Maybe I inherited
my "Always Late" gene from you.

1146
01:23:09,158 --> 01:23:12,030
- Careful, buddy. You'll
understand why I'm late

1147
01:23:12,074 --> 01:23:14,990
when you know who
I've just seen.

1148
01:23:15,033 --> 01:23:18,819
Your probation officer.
- Bad news?

1149
01:23:18,863 --> 01:23:20,908
- Well, that all depends,

1150
01:23:20,952 --> 01:23:23,259
on whether or not you like
the band Triple Kill.

1151
01:23:23,302 --> 01:23:25,609
- Mom, I don't get you.

1152
01:23:25,652 --> 01:23:28,264
- He said you can go to their
concert next week in Baltimore.

1153
01:23:28,307 --> 01:23:31,397
- What?! Are you kidding?
Man, that's awesome!

1154
01:23:31,441 --> 01:23:33,704
- He'll allow it this one time.
There's not that much time left

1155
01:23:33,747 --> 01:23:35,706
in your probation anyway.

1156
01:23:35,749 --> 01:23:38,056
- Oh, Mom! Thanks for
making this happen.

1157
01:23:38,100 --> 01:23:41,494
- There is one condition though.

1158
01:23:41,538 --> 01:23:44,149
- Oh no. I knew it.

1159
01:23:44,193 --> 01:23:47,326
- You gotta treat
your mom to lunch.

1160
01:23:47,370 --> 01:23:49,981
