1
00:01:03,204 --> 00:01:07,106
Neil Diamond. Hot August night, 1972.

2
00:01:07,308 --> 00:01:12,211
That concert rocked and rolled.
I know because I was there.

3
00:01:17,719 --> 00:01:19,084
That's me.

4
00:01:22,557 --> 00:01:23,717
My water broke.

5
00:01:23,925 --> 00:01:27,986
Eversince then, I've had this
cosmic connection with Neil.

6
00:01:28,229 --> 00:01:30,026
But this story isn't about Neil.

7
00:01:30,231 --> 00:01:33,723
It's about me and my two pals,
Darren and J.D.

8
00:01:34,235 --> 00:01:36,897
Best friends since fifth grade.

9
00:01:39,073 --> 00:01:42,770
That's J.D. He's lactose intolerant.

10
00:01:45,079 --> 00:01:46,910
And he's not very bright.

11
00:01:47,615 --> 00:01:49,640
That's Darren Silverman.

12
00:01:49,851 --> 00:01:51,409
He's a romantic.

13
00:01:51,619 --> 00:01:55,020
But when it comes to women,
he's incredibly gullible.

14
00:02:01,929 --> 00:02:04,090
That's me, Wayne.

15
00:02:04,565 --> 00:02:06,260
I'm loyal to my friends.

16
00:02:06,467 --> 00:02:09,925
-I'd beat you up if you weren't a girl.
-Me too.

17
00:02:19,313 --> 00:02:21,304
After that, I started working out.

18
00:02:22,216 --> 00:02:25,014
We stayed best friends
throughout high school.

19
00:02:25,219 --> 00:02:27,779
I was the third-string quarterback.

20
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:31,790
J.D. became the school mascot.

21
00:02:32,627 --> 00:02:36,119
Hey, what did you say
I didn't really motherfucking hearyou

22
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:39,060
Yeah, yeah you
Yeah you, yeah you, yeah you

23
00:02:40,468 --> 00:02:43,335
And Darrenjoined
the cheerleading squad.

24
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:48,808
Oh, that's Sandy.

25
00:02:49,077 --> 00:02:51,807
Yeah, Darren's always
had a thing for her.

26
00:02:52,814 --> 00:02:54,839
When you're up against a Warbird

27
00:02:55,049 --> 00:02:56,277
You're upside down!

28
00:02:57,852 --> 00:02:59,444
Oh, that's Coach Norton.

29
00:02:59,654 --> 00:03:03,090
He was a big influence in ourlives.
He taught us many things.

30
00:03:03,291 --> 00:03:05,657
Two things you got to remember, boys.

31
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:09,591
Number one: Stay away from women.

32
00:03:09,797 --> 00:03:12,664
All they want from you
is your man juice.

33
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,024
Now...

34
00:03:14,235 --> 00:03:19,400
...if you get any urges that you can't
suppress with hard liquor, use this.

35
00:03:21,209 --> 00:03:23,837
-Oh, number two....
-Sportsmanship.

36
00:03:24,045 --> 00:03:25,376
Sportsmanship.

37
00:03:25,713 --> 00:03:27,476
Sportsmanship.

38
00:03:30,451 --> 00:03:32,544
You fairy wimp fruit bag!

39
00:03:32,754 --> 00:03:34,244
You suck!

40
00:03:37,158 --> 00:03:39,888
Le Fessier! Get out there!

41
00:03:40,495 --> 00:03:42,725
I'm just gonna get my helmet.

42
00:03:42,997 --> 00:03:45,488
Hey, guys! Guys, I'm in!

43
00:03:46,434 --> 00:03:48,595
-See, he's going in!
-Oh, my God!

44
00:03:50,605 --> 00:03:52,664
Go, Wayne! Go, Wayne!

45
00:03:52,874 --> 00:03:56,002
Blue 48! Blue 48!

46
00:03:56,210 --> 00:03:57,734
Go! Set!

47
00:03:57,945 --> 00:03:59,003
Hike!

48
00:04:07,455 --> 00:04:10,015
But now we're all grown-up.

49
00:04:18,299 --> 00:04:22,292
J.D. is rapidly working his way
up the ladder at Subway.

50
00:04:22,670 --> 00:04:24,968
Recently he was promoted...

51
00:04:25,173 --> 00:04:29,041
...to temporary second assistant manager
in charge of training.

52
00:04:29,243 --> 00:04:31,837
Okay, McNugent,
let's see what you got.

53
00:04:32,046 --> 00:04:37,177
I've been working on them for 8 weeks.
I present the future of Subway.

54
00:04:37,385 --> 00:04:38,647
Bellston...

55
00:04:39,053 --> 00:04:41,886
...three sizes of bevy are small,
medium and what?

56
00:04:43,357 --> 00:04:46,554
-Big?
-Like we practiced. You can do this.

57
00:04:46,761 --> 00:04:48,058
L....

58
00:04:53,634 --> 00:04:55,124
Long!

59
00:04:55,336 --> 00:04:57,327
Okay, we'll come back to you.

60
00:04:57,538 --> 00:05:00,268
This guy's my stinkiest student
by far.

61
00:05:00,474 --> 00:05:02,271
Trimball, let's see your sub.

62
00:05:04,111 --> 00:05:06,705
No, no. Meat on the inside,
bread outside.

63
00:05:08,249 --> 00:05:10,080
Okay, take it away.

64
00:05:10,284 --> 00:05:12,047
Take it away!

65
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:16,287
Don't judge me on those two guys.
This next guy's my protégé.

66
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:20,392
He's top of his class, and for his
thesis he made a party sub.

67
00:05:21,329 --> 00:05:23,490
Heston, where's the party sub?

68
00:05:35,476 --> 00:05:38,536
Darren is a social director
at a retirement home.

69
00:05:38,746 --> 00:05:39,735
B-17.

70
00:05:40,248 --> 00:05:41,510
Bingo.

71
00:05:42,083 --> 00:05:43,414
Bingo.

72
00:05:44,018 --> 00:05:45,178
Abe...

73
00:05:45,419 --> 00:05:48,616
...pull your pants up
or no more Matlock.

74
00:05:53,294 --> 00:05:54,727
I started my own business.

75
00:05:57,832 --> 00:05:59,561
What are we dealing with here?

76
00:06:00,201 --> 00:06:02,465
I don't know, but it sounds big.

77
00:06:04,171 --> 00:06:05,934
Stay back. I'm going in.

78
00:06:12,213 --> 00:06:13,202
Careful, sonny.

79
00:06:19,453 --> 00:06:21,751
So you're causing
all this trouble, huh?

80
00:06:21,956 --> 00:06:22,945
Come here.

81
00:06:23,157 --> 00:06:25,785
Hey there. Hello.

82
00:06:29,130 --> 00:06:31,690
Here's the ferocious beast, huh?

83
00:06:33,801 --> 00:06:35,291
Hey, where's your mommy?

84
00:06:38,272 --> 00:06:39,637
Get off! Get it off!

85
00:06:52,987 --> 00:06:54,545
Is it dead?

86
00:06:54,755 --> 00:06:55,881
No.

87
00:06:56,090 --> 00:06:58,888
But she is in one deep coon coma.

88
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:14,373
Stop it!

89
00:07:15,643 --> 00:07:19,477
But we all have one mystical thing
in common: Ourlove forNeil.

90
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,444
That's ourband,
Diamonds in the Rough.

91
00:08:18,172 --> 00:08:19,662
Hey, I'm Darren.

92
00:08:19,907 --> 00:08:20,896
Sophie.

93
00:08:21,108 --> 00:08:23,702
Do you, maybe, want to grab
a drink with me?

94
00:08:23,911 --> 00:08:26,209
I'm sorry. I'm involved.

95
00:08:26,414 --> 00:08:28,143
With a real entertainer.

96
00:08:37,591 --> 00:08:41,687
I can't believe I got blown off again.
I'll never meet the right girl.

97
00:08:41,929 --> 00:08:44,420
You don't want
a chick who'd fuck a mime.

98
00:08:44,632 --> 00:08:48,090
Dude, what does a mime look like
when it's having sex anyway?

99
00:08:48,302 --> 00:08:49,769
It's probably like:

100
00:08:51,105 --> 00:08:54,506
"l'm a mime. I'm a mime."

101
00:08:54,708 --> 00:08:56,676
Hey, mimes don't talk.

102
00:08:58,779 --> 00:09:01,771
They do when they're off duty.

103
00:09:03,017 --> 00:09:06,111
It's not her. It's all women.

104
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:10,120
I'm really afraid that
there's nobody out there for me.

105
00:09:10,324 --> 00:09:12,189
The only girl I ever loved...

106
00:09:12,393 --> 00:09:14,827
...walked out of my life years ago.

107
00:09:15,296 --> 00:09:16,456
Sandy Perkus.

108
00:09:16,664 --> 00:09:18,131
-Rememberher?
-Smile.

109
00:09:18,332 --> 00:09:20,197
Her family was with the circus.

110
00:09:20,468 --> 00:09:22,026
Her dad was The Strong Man.

111
00:09:22,236 --> 00:09:24,033
Hermom was The Bearded Lady.

112
00:09:24,238 --> 00:09:26,297
Herbrother was The Dog-faced Boy.

113
00:09:27,675 --> 00:09:31,475
Before I mustered the courage
to ask her out, she moved away.

114
00:09:33,247 --> 00:09:34,976
You know, I truly believe...

115
00:09:35,182 --> 00:09:39,642
...that there is a one and only
someone for everyone.

116
00:09:39,987 --> 00:09:41,352
And Sandy...

117
00:09:41,755 --> 00:09:43,484
...Sandy Perkus...

118
00:09:45,159 --> 00:09:47,059
...was my one and only.

119
00:09:47,361 --> 00:09:50,353
Man, that is so romantic.

120
00:09:50,631 --> 00:09:52,861
Oh, my God!
Look at that juicy piece of ass.

121
00:09:56,871 --> 00:09:58,429
What do you think of her?

122
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:00,131
-Who?
-Right there.

123
00:10:00,374 --> 00:10:01,705
In the red?

124
00:10:03,310 --> 00:10:05,403
-Yeah, she's gorgeous.
-Go talk to her.

125
00:10:05,613 --> 00:10:07,342
-No.
-Okay, I'll do it for you.

126
00:10:07,548 --> 00:10:09,038
What? Hey, wait.

127
00:10:11,385 --> 00:10:12,716
Hi. I'm Wayne.

128
00:10:13,053 --> 00:10:15,044
-No.
-No, you don't understand.

129
00:10:15,489 --> 00:10:16,820
I'm not hitting on you.

130
00:10:17,057 --> 00:10:18,046
Back off.

131
00:10:18,259 --> 00:10:21,251
I just want to tell you
about my buddy, Darren.

132
00:10:21,462 --> 00:10:23,191
He's smart, he's sensitive--

133
00:10:23,397 --> 00:10:25,524
-I don't care.
-He'd make a great husband.

134
00:10:25,733 --> 00:10:27,758
-I don't want to meet him.
-Great.

135
00:10:31,071 --> 00:10:34,336
Dude, she wants you.
She thinks you're really cute.

136
00:10:34,575 --> 00:10:36,133
-Really?
-Yeah, she's like:

137
00:10:36,343 --> 00:10:39,005
"Oh, I'm so excited to meet him,"
and everything.

138
00:10:39,246 --> 00:10:40,713
-Are you sure?
-Totally!

139
00:10:40,915 --> 00:10:42,906
Get down there and make your move.

140
00:10:44,418 --> 00:10:45,544
I don't know.

141
00:10:45,753 --> 00:10:46,742
Come on!

142
00:10:46,954 --> 00:10:49,286
-Carpe poon!
-Really?

143
00:10:51,926 --> 00:10:54,793
-Okay, I'll do it.
-All right!

144
00:11:03,137 --> 00:11:04,229
I'm Darren.

145
00:11:05,673 --> 00:11:10,610
Darren. My friend said
you wanted to meet me.

146
00:11:10,811 --> 00:11:11,971
He lied.

147
00:11:12,713 --> 00:11:14,544
That's a good one.

148
00:11:15,349 --> 00:11:17,817
No, seriously.
I don't want to meet you.

149
00:11:25,226 --> 00:11:28,218
My friend must have been mistaken.

150
00:11:30,164 --> 00:11:32,564
I'm really sorry to bother you.

151
00:11:37,438 --> 00:11:38,871
Let me guess.

152
00:11:39,607 --> 00:11:43,043
That jerk tried to get into your pants
with some tacky line.

153
00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:44,772
I'm not like that.

154
00:11:45,012 --> 00:11:46,445
I use magic.

155
00:11:47,214 --> 00:11:48,340
Beat it, baldy.

156
00:11:48,549 --> 00:11:51,313
Okay, good stuff.
Tough crowd. I like that.

157
00:11:51,518 --> 00:11:53,509
I have here two...

158
00:11:53,721 --> 00:11:55,916
...ordinary metal rings.

159
00:11:56,123 --> 00:11:58,057
You and me.

160
00:12:01,695 --> 00:12:02,684
I love you.

161
00:12:03,931 --> 00:12:05,421
Sorry, I forgot my beer.

162
00:12:06,133 --> 00:12:09,500
This is my boyfriend, Darren.
So hit the bricks, porky.

163
00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:12,302
Okay. Nice to meet you, Darren.

164
00:12:12,506 --> 00:12:13,495
Satan.

165
00:12:17,878 --> 00:12:20,403
I'm sorry about
hitting on you before--

166
00:12:20,614 --> 00:12:22,377
-You should be.
-I am. I am.

167
00:12:22,583 --> 00:12:25,484
I just, I wasn't thinking in....

168
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:29,550
You're so beautiful, and I....

169
00:12:31,492 --> 00:12:32,481
I'm sorry.

170
00:12:33,427 --> 00:12:36,225
So make up for it. Buy me a drink.

171
00:12:37,097 --> 00:12:39,224
-Yeah. Okay.
-I'll have a Scotch.

172
00:12:39,433 --> 00:12:42,300
Give the lady a Scotch,
and I'll have another beer.

173
00:12:42,503 --> 00:12:45,563
-He'll have a gin and tonic.
-Make that a gin and tonic.

174
00:12:49,109 --> 00:12:52,408
Can you believe he hooked up
with the queen of all hotties?

175
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:55,374
They're just having a drink together.

176
00:12:55,582 --> 00:12:59,143
It's not like they're
going steady or anything.

177
00:13:02,122 --> 00:13:04,488
It's midnight.
You know what that means?

178
00:13:04,692 --> 00:13:06,626
No. What?

179
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:08,657
It's our six-week anniversary.

180
00:13:10,898 --> 00:13:13,093
-Did you get me anything?
-No.

181
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:15,063
That's okay. That's okay.

182
00:13:15,269 --> 00:13:16,759
No big deal. But...

183
00:13:18,272 --> 00:13:19,705
...I...

184
00:13:20,441 --> 00:13:22,705
...got you a little something.

185
00:13:24,378 --> 00:13:26,209
Thanks. That's really nice.

186
00:13:32,119 --> 00:13:34,451
You know, I've been thinking.

187
00:13:36,857 --> 00:13:39,621
We've been together for a while now...

188
00:13:39,827 --> 00:13:42,193
...and it seems like
maybe it's time...

189
00:13:43,831 --> 00:13:47,494
...we get a little more intimate.

190
00:13:48,802 --> 00:13:51,032
Are you saying you want to have sex?

191
00:13:52,973 --> 00:13:54,463
Yeah, I am.

192
00:13:54,675 --> 00:13:58,634
I don't believe in premarital sex.
I'd rather not cheapen what we have.

193
00:13:58,846 --> 00:14:02,111
Of course. Of course not.
Me neither.

194
00:14:02,316 --> 00:14:04,307
-So it's best to wait.
-You're right.

195
00:14:04,518 --> 00:14:07,885
I think-- I mean, you're--
It's best.

196
00:14:08,922 --> 00:14:10,150
But...

197
00:14:10,591 --> 00:14:12,923
...that doesn't mean that we can't...

198
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:15,988
...pleasure each other in other ways.

199
00:14:22,102 --> 00:14:23,626
I got you.

200
00:14:23,837 --> 00:14:25,395
Oh, I got you.

201
00:14:37,317 --> 00:14:39,478
That was really great.

202
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:41,048
Thanks.

203
00:14:43,357 --> 00:14:45,757
That got me pretty excited.

204
00:14:47,327 --> 00:14:48,919
That's nice.

205
00:14:49,129 --> 00:14:53,725
I mean, I wouldn't mind if someone
did that to me.

206
00:14:54,168 --> 00:14:57,035
Oh, I get it.
You want me to go down on you.

207
00:14:59,473 --> 00:15:01,532
I would love to, but I can't.

208
00:15:01,742 --> 00:15:04,438
I have very, very sensitive gums.

209
00:15:07,114 --> 00:15:10,311
You have gums--
It's a medical condition.

210
00:15:11,385 --> 00:15:14,616
I wouldn't want to cause you
any pain, baby. No.

211
00:15:15,155 --> 00:15:16,713
You're so sweet.

212
00:15:22,029 --> 00:15:26,898
You know, there are other ways to give
me pleasure without using your mouth.

213
00:15:27,234 --> 00:15:30,260
Oh, God, I am so inconsiderate.
I'm sorry.

214
00:15:30,504 --> 00:15:33,735
No, that's fine. That's fine.

215
00:15:38,545 --> 00:15:40,035
Have fun.

216
00:15:44,218 --> 00:15:46,880
-Watch your head.
-This place is a dump.

217
00:15:48,088 --> 00:15:50,283
I really don't want to do this.

218
00:15:51,258 --> 00:15:56,059
It'll be great. It's our Sunday ritual
and I want you to be part of it.

219
00:15:56,263 --> 00:16:00,393
I want you to get to know these guys.
You'll love them, honey.

220
00:16:01,602 --> 00:16:06,005
-Yeah, buddy. What's up, dude?
-What's up, J.D.?

221
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:09,175
Judy, awesome to meet you.

222
00:16:09,409 --> 00:16:10,637
Judith.

223
00:16:10,844 --> 00:16:13,904
Judith. And a beer bong for the lady?

224
00:16:14,248 --> 00:16:16,045
-No.
-Totally cool.

225
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:18,445
No peer pressure.

226
00:16:24,625 --> 00:16:28,083
Judith rules. Sorry. Come on in.

227
00:16:29,129 --> 00:16:30,528
Check it out. Chewie.

228
00:16:32,332 --> 00:16:33,697
You want a drink?

229
00:16:34,201 --> 00:16:36,101
-Scotch on the rocks.
-You want ice?

230
00:16:36,303 --> 00:16:38,271
I'll help you with that.

231
00:16:39,439 --> 00:16:41,964
Hey, Judith.
Can I give you the grand tour?

232
00:16:42,543 --> 00:16:45,478
Let's start right here
in the "Hall o' Neil."

233
00:16:45,779 --> 00:16:49,647
This is Neil, '74. Check this out.

234
00:16:49,950 --> 00:16:53,886
This is a set list
from the Millennium Concert. Look:

235
00:16:54,121 --> 00:16:56,453
Signed by Neil. Got that on eBay.

236
00:16:57,291 --> 00:16:58,781
Looks like a Xerox.

237
00:16:58,992 --> 00:17:02,393
No. This cost a lot of money.
Check this out.

238
00:17:02,629 --> 00:17:05,063
-I think you got taken.
-Ready?

239
00:17:05,299 --> 00:17:06,698
This shirt...

240
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:08,663
...was worn by Neil...

241
00:17:10,037 --> 00:17:11,698
...in concert.

242
00:17:11,905 --> 00:17:14,305
Check it out. We snuck backstage...

243
00:17:14,508 --> 00:17:18,069
...and totally stole it from him
while he was taking a whiz.

244
00:17:18,278 --> 00:17:21,270
In my profession, we call
your obsession with Neil...

245
00:17:21,481 --> 00:17:23,813
...a delusional projection fantasy.

246
00:17:24,017 --> 00:17:28,647
Yeah, sure. But he's America's
greatest songwriter and he's our hero.

247
00:17:28,855 --> 00:17:31,449
And he's playing the Forum
in two weeks.

248
00:17:31,658 --> 00:17:36,220
Of course, we can't go because
of the whole restraining order thing.

249
00:17:44,605 --> 00:17:46,835
Neil, I love you!

250
00:17:47,107 --> 00:17:48,096
You again!

251
00:17:52,613 --> 00:17:54,308
Neil! Where are you going?

252
00:17:54,514 --> 00:17:58,450
I want to party with you.
I want to party with you!

253
00:18:00,354 --> 00:18:00,420
Game's on.

254
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:01,682
Game's on.

255
00:18:04,725 --> 00:18:06,590
-Give me the remote.
-I want to go.

256
00:18:06,793 --> 00:18:08,727
-Give me a beer.
-We just got here.

257
00:18:08,929 --> 00:18:10,419
These guys are pigs.

258
00:18:10,631 --> 00:18:13,031
Come on. No, they're not that--

259
00:18:14,101 --> 00:18:15,966
Hey! What are you doing?

260
00:18:16,203 --> 00:18:20,435
Dude, if you get the nachos
stuck together, that's one nacho.

261
00:18:20,641 --> 00:18:25,203
Okay, look. Why don't we just stay
for a little bit, okay?

262
00:18:26,079 --> 00:18:28,172
Oh, take mine. Take mine.

263
00:18:28,415 --> 00:18:30,178
Give her the old sweep-a-roo.

264
00:18:30,384 --> 00:18:33,683
Old Ethel. We've been through
a lot of games together.

265
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:35,217
Enjoy.

266
00:18:36,156 --> 00:18:39,057
I'll help you.
She has multiple reclining positions.

267
00:18:39,259 --> 00:18:41,227
-I can sit forward.
-It's stuck.

268
00:18:41,895 --> 00:18:43,829
-It's fine.
-Takes a little muscle.

269
00:18:44,064 --> 00:18:46,692
Come on, you fucking piece of shit.

270
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:49,061
-I don't need--
-It's no trouble.

271
00:18:50,737 --> 00:18:51,704
Are you okay?

272
00:18:51,905 --> 00:18:54,669
I'm sorry. That hardly ever happens.

273
00:18:54,908 --> 00:18:57,172
You know what? I think I-- Yep.

274
00:18:57,411 --> 00:19:00,346
It's the lug nut. Fixed it.
Please have a seat.

275
00:19:01,348 --> 00:19:02,815
I'll stand.

276
00:19:03,583 --> 00:19:04,845
I'm a--

277
00:19:07,187 --> 00:19:10,020
-Sorry.
-Get me something.

278
00:19:13,627 --> 00:19:17,085
So Darren tells me
you're a psychologist.

279
00:19:18,331 --> 00:19:19,992
-That's right.
-Interesting.

280
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,758
I'm in a related field.

281
00:19:22,102 --> 00:19:23,433
Really? What's that?

282
00:19:23,737 --> 00:19:25,432
Pest and rodent removal.

283
00:19:25,939 --> 00:19:27,839
How is that related?

284
00:19:28,542 --> 00:19:29,804
We both help people.

285
00:19:30,010 --> 00:19:33,173
While you deal with their emotional
and intellectual needs...

286
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:36,713
...I protect them from gophers,
coons, roaches, silverfish....

287
00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:38,144
He launched it.

288
00:19:38,885 --> 00:19:40,182
Touchdown!

289
00:19:51,798 --> 00:19:55,199
I don't want you to see
Wayne or J.D. ever again, Darren!

290
00:19:55,402 --> 00:19:57,131
But they're my best friends.

291
00:19:57,370 --> 00:20:01,534
You're getting new friends, and you're
quitting that bullshit band.

292
00:20:01,875 --> 00:20:06,175
I know you're upset. I do.
But I am not dropping Wayne and J.D...

293
00:20:06,379 --> 00:20:08,506
...and I'm not quitting the band.

294
00:20:09,049 --> 00:20:11,210
Okay, fine. No more sex.

295
00:20:11,618 --> 00:20:12,550
What?

296
00:20:12,753 --> 00:20:14,744
You're not allowed to go down on me
for one month.

297
00:20:14,955 --> 00:20:16,013
No, Judith, please--

298
00:20:16,223 --> 00:20:19,852
Don't make me take away
your masturbation privileges.

299
00:20:41,548 --> 00:20:45,507
You go, boys. You sing this song.
You know it. Come on, boys. Sing it!

300
00:20:45,719 --> 00:20:48,187
-Sing it!
-This blows, man.

301
00:20:49,990 --> 00:20:52,584
Judith's out of control.
We gotta do something.

302
00:20:52,793 --> 00:20:55,853
Besides ruining the band,
what else has she done?

303
00:20:56,062 --> 00:20:59,498
Ever since she moved in with him,
she's controlled his life.

304
00:20:59,699 --> 00:21:02,930
She didn't like his ass.
Made him get butt-cheek implants.

305
00:21:08,074 --> 00:21:10,634
I thought his ass looked tighter.

306
00:21:10,877 --> 00:21:12,640
Check this out. Last night...

307
00:21:13,213 --> 00:21:15,545
...torched his Neil Diamond albums.

308
00:21:16,149 --> 00:21:17,309
She torched Neil?

309
00:21:23,657 --> 00:21:25,522
You're right. She's a monster.

310
00:21:25,725 --> 00:21:27,625
Two, three, four.

311
00:21:45,979 --> 00:21:47,537
-Hey!
-Yes!

312
00:21:47,747 --> 00:21:50,113
-Hey, guys, sorry I'm late.
-It's all right.

313
00:21:50,317 --> 00:21:53,081
I only have a minute.
I have to wax Judith's legs.

314
00:21:53,286 --> 00:21:55,754
-We miss you.
-We never see you anymore.

315
00:21:55,956 --> 00:21:57,389
I know, I'm sorry...

316
00:21:57,591 --> 00:22:00,924
...but I've just been so happy
spending time with Judith.

317
00:22:01,127 --> 00:22:03,357
Plus, my relationship
counseling sessions--

318
00:22:03,563 --> 00:22:04,655
Counseling?

319
00:22:04,865 --> 00:22:07,732
Yeah. I go two hours,
three times a week.

320
00:22:07,934 --> 00:22:09,663
Oh. Who's your counselor?

321
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:10,894
Judith.

322
00:22:11,104 --> 00:22:13,334
We don't think she's right for you.

323
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:15,030
Break up with her.

324
00:22:15,275 --> 00:22:17,800
She's ruining our lives and yours.

325
00:22:18,011 --> 00:22:20,104
This graph should
illustrate our point.

326
00:22:20,313 --> 00:22:24,716
Before Judith, our fun level
was at an all-time high: 93.

327
00:22:24,951 --> 00:22:26,714
It is now an eight.

328
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:29,013
Band numbers have
plunged dramatically.

329
00:22:29,222 --> 00:22:33,921
Girls, never very high, at nine.
But look now. Two!

330
00:22:34,127 --> 00:22:36,220
This has led to increased wanking off.

331
00:22:36,463 --> 00:22:37,953
I'm chafing.

332
00:22:39,299 --> 00:22:41,426
Shit, I gotta go home
and heat the wax.

333
00:22:41,635 --> 00:22:45,332
Guys, listen.
Thanks for your concern, really.

334
00:22:45,538 --> 00:22:49,304
I miss you too. But it was great
seeing you, all right?

335
00:22:55,982 --> 00:22:58,314
That guy's in serious trouble.

336
00:22:59,152 --> 00:23:01,120
We need to save him.

337
00:23:03,423 --> 00:23:04,856
Sorry to bother you.

338
00:23:05,058 --> 00:23:06,650
What are you doing here?

339
00:23:07,327 --> 00:23:09,591
We want to apologize
for the beer shower.

340
00:23:09,829 --> 00:23:11,763
And the salsa bath. That was bad.

341
00:23:11,998 --> 00:23:15,229
-Get the hell out of here.
-Just give us a minute, okay?

342
00:23:15,435 --> 00:23:17,460
My rate is $200 an hour.

343
00:23:18,338 --> 00:23:19,999
Do you have any money?

344
00:23:20,674 --> 00:23:22,164
I got some of that.

345
00:23:24,444 --> 00:23:26,241
Just give me the big bills.

346
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:28,805
Six. Is that all you have?

347
00:23:29,015 --> 00:23:30,846
Thirty. $7.38.

348
00:23:34,554 --> 00:23:36,215
Two and a half minutes.

349
00:23:36,923 --> 00:23:40,825
We don't want you seeing Darren.
We don't think you're right for him.

350
00:23:41,027 --> 00:23:42,221
The band needs him.

351
00:23:42,429 --> 00:23:45,660
-But we're prepared to buy you off.
-With what?

352
00:23:47,467 --> 00:23:48,934
My house.

353
00:23:49,202 --> 00:23:50,760
Okay? Look.

354
00:23:51,905 --> 00:23:56,001
My grandma here? She was born in this
house, is buried in the back yard.

355
00:23:56,576 --> 00:23:57,873
There's my mom...

356
00:23:58,078 --> 00:24:00,546
...there's my dad and there's me.

357
00:24:01,214 --> 00:24:04,775
My dad was dropping me
on my head. But...

358
00:24:05,285 --> 00:24:08,777
...we're willing to sign
this over to you...

359
00:24:08,989 --> 00:24:11,549
...if you just agree
not to see Darren.

360
00:24:11,758 --> 00:24:14,420
I don't want your shitty house
or your dead grandma.

361
00:24:15,095 --> 00:24:17,791
I'll throw J.D. in.
He doesn't look like much...

362
00:24:17,998 --> 00:24:19,431
...but he's hung like a horse.

363
00:24:19,632 --> 00:24:20,929
It's true.

364
00:24:21,167 --> 00:24:24,330
Look, Darren's mine.
There's nothing you can do about it.

365
00:24:24,537 --> 00:24:28,234
I own him. He does whatever I say.
I'm in complete control of him.

366
00:24:28,441 --> 00:24:31,308
He's my puppet
and I'm his puppet master.

367
00:24:31,511 --> 00:24:33,206
You're not taking Darren away!

368
00:24:33,413 --> 00:24:34,505
Just try to stop me.

369
00:24:37,050 --> 00:24:38,745
One round, winner takes Darren.

370
00:24:38,952 --> 00:24:40,044
-You're on.
-Kick her ass.

371
00:24:40,253 --> 00:24:41,345
Go.

372
00:24:42,355 --> 00:24:45,847
You've got quite a grip.
You must be a heavy masturbator.

373
00:24:46,059 --> 00:24:48,721
My guess is three times a day?

374
00:24:48,928 --> 00:24:50,919
I bet you're a premature ejaculator.

375
00:24:51,131 --> 00:24:52,962
You start off with a big bang.

376
00:24:53,166 --> 00:24:55,498
Before you know it, you're limp.

377
00:24:55,935 --> 00:24:59,166
-I win, you lose. Now get out.
-God!

378
00:25:09,115 --> 00:25:10,548
Hey, check it out.

379
00:25:14,387 --> 00:25:15,786
Hey, baby.

380
00:25:16,022 --> 00:25:18,388
Hello, ladies.

381
00:25:19,025 --> 00:25:20,356
So how much?

382
00:25:20,894 --> 00:25:24,352
Fifty bucks for you,
and 200 for your friend.

383
00:25:26,499 --> 00:25:28,160
-Okay.
-All right.

384
00:25:28,835 --> 00:25:31,531
I want you to laugh
like he just said something.

385
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,964
Perfect!

386
00:25:35,308 --> 00:25:38,505
Get this one.
Be like this. Like this.

387
00:25:38,711 --> 00:25:39,575
Douche, douche.

388
00:25:39,946 --> 00:25:42,005
Yeah, you. Slap his ass.

389
00:25:44,651 --> 00:25:46,642
That's not sexy.

390
00:25:56,096 --> 00:25:57,757
Watch it.

391
00:26:00,366 --> 00:26:02,163
You're moving my guy!

392
00:26:08,541 --> 00:26:10,475
Lookit. Lookit.

393
00:26:15,348 --> 00:26:16,576
Good.

394
00:26:19,586 --> 00:26:21,110
-Awesome.
-Check this out.

395
00:26:24,791 --> 00:26:28,124
Mail, check. Go. Don't look back.

396
00:26:29,295 --> 00:26:30,284
Hurry up. Come on.

397
00:26:31,598 --> 00:26:33,293
Hi, Judith. How's it going?

398
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:36,663
Not so good. Look at these.

399
00:26:39,205 --> 00:26:40,536
Oh, my God.

400
00:26:42,575 --> 00:26:43,803
He's sick.

401
00:26:44,010 --> 00:26:44,874
He's perverted.

402
00:26:45,078 --> 00:26:48,241
-He's cheating on you.
-With two chicks.

403
00:26:48,448 --> 00:26:50,678
I don't know. I guess I'd dump him?

404
00:26:50,884 --> 00:26:52,875
-Oh, totally.
-Right?

405
00:26:53,419 --> 00:26:57,219
Do you guys notice anything weird
about these photos?

406
00:26:57,457 --> 00:26:59,618
No, that's Darren, all right.

407
00:27:02,328 --> 00:27:04,728
Darren doesn't have a tattoo.

408
00:27:06,733 --> 00:27:07,859
Nice try, idiots.

409
00:27:08,468 --> 00:27:10,959
If I ever see you near Darren again...

410
00:27:11,404 --> 00:27:12,803
...I'll kill you.

411
00:27:24,484 --> 00:27:28,944
Thanks for meeting me here.
I have something important to say.

412
00:27:29,155 --> 00:27:31,089
Oh, man. You broke up?

413
00:27:31,324 --> 00:27:32,621
No.

414
00:27:33,826 --> 00:27:37,922
Out of the blue,
Judith proposed to me. We're engaged.

415
00:27:38,164 --> 00:27:41,190
-What?
-Dude, congratulations.

416
00:27:42,335 --> 00:27:45,463
Starting next week,
I'll be Mr. Darren Fessbeggler.

417
00:27:45,672 --> 00:27:49,039
Right, because you're gonna take
her last name, huh?

418
00:27:49,242 --> 00:27:50,266
Yeah, well...

419
00:27:50,510 --> 00:27:54,002
...Judith feels, and I think she's got
a really good point here...

420
00:27:54,214 --> 00:27:57,479
...that it's sexist for the woman
to take the man's last name.

421
00:27:58,685 --> 00:28:00,744
Anyway, it's too late to change it.

422
00:28:00,954 --> 00:28:03,855
We've already ordered
the monogrammed towels.

423
00:28:04,357 --> 00:28:05,790
Darren.

424
00:28:06,125 --> 00:28:07,422
Sandy?

425
00:28:07,627 --> 00:28:08,924
Sandy Perkus.

426
00:28:09,128 --> 00:28:12,359
Oh, my God, Darren.
It's been so long.

427
00:28:12,565 --> 00:28:13,964
Yeah, it has.

428
00:28:15,235 --> 00:28:16,259
Hey, it's Wayne.

429
00:28:16,469 --> 00:28:19,029
High school, remember? You remember?

430
00:28:25,912 --> 00:28:29,109
Right! The senior talent show.

431
00:28:29,315 --> 00:28:32,216
Yeah, you were booed off the stage.

432
00:28:33,453 --> 00:28:34,818
That was me.

433
00:28:35,054 --> 00:28:37,352
Yep. Sandy, remember me?
J.D. McNugent?

434
00:28:38,057 --> 00:28:39,786
I went to the prom...

435
00:28:39,993 --> 00:28:43,019
...with a tuxedo painted
on my naked body.

436
00:28:43,229 --> 00:28:45,288
Oh, I guess I missed it.

437
00:28:45,665 --> 00:28:50,068
I spilled a drink and the paint ran
and everyone could see my dong.

438
00:28:50,436 --> 00:28:52,904
It doesn't ring a bell.

439
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:57,869
Remember, in science, I was lighting
farts with the Bunsen burner...

440
00:28:58,077 --> 00:29:00,341
...and I singed my ball sac?

441
00:29:01,914 --> 00:29:02,972
No.

442
00:29:03,249 --> 00:29:06,878
Man. I still can't grow hair
on my left nut.

443
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:08,844
Sucks.

444
00:29:10,256 --> 00:29:12,190
So how are you?

445
00:29:12,425 --> 00:29:15,155
Great. Great.
I just moved back to town.

446
00:29:15,361 --> 00:29:16,988
Oh, wow, that's great.

447
00:29:17,764 --> 00:29:21,666
Gosh, you know, I have to go,
but it was great seeing you.

448
00:29:21,868 --> 00:29:24,462
Yeah, same here. Me too.

449
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:28,439
-See you.
-Take care.

450
00:29:28,641 --> 00:29:29,767
-Okay, bye.
-Awesome.

451
00:29:29,976 --> 00:29:32,376
Yeah, bye. Bye.

452
00:29:34,647 --> 00:29:36,012
Oh, my God.

453
00:29:36,215 --> 00:29:37,739
-This is it!
-What?

454
00:29:37,950 --> 00:29:42,114
It's your big chance. Sandy Perkus
has just walked back into your life.

455
00:29:42,622 --> 00:29:46,023
You even said so yourself.
She was your one and only someone!

456
00:29:46,225 --> 00:29:49,456
She used to be.
Now Judith is my one and only someone.

457
00:29:49,662 --> 00:29:52,631
I'll talk to you guys later. Okay?

458
00:29:53,333 --> 00:29:56,302
Isn't "one and only" like, one...

459
00:29:57,704 --> 00:29:59,137
...and only?

460
00:30:06,245 --> 00:30:08,839
-Here's your drink.
-Where's the lemon wedge?

461
00:30:09,048 --> 00:30:11,539
We're out of lemons,
but I'll run to the store--

462
00:30:11,751 --> 00:30:14,743
Forget it. I want you to meet
two exciting people.

463
00:30:15,555 --> 00:30:18,319
Brett is a tax attorney,
and Clayton's a CPA.

464
00:30:18,524 --> 00:30:20,992
Wow, that is exciting.

465
00:30:21,194 --> 00:30:22,821
This is my fiancé, Darren.

466
00:30:23,029 --> 00:30:24,428
-Pleased to meet you.
-Same.

467
00:30:24,630 --> 00:30:26,359
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

468
00:30:26,566 --> 00:30:27,863
Excuse me, I'll get it.

469
00:30:34,507 --> 00:30:38,204
Is Darren here?
I think he left his Vespa helmet.

470
00:30:38,411 --> 00:30:39,400
What's going on?

471
00:30:39,879 --> 00:30:41,813
We're having our engagement party.

472
00:30:42,014 --> 00:30:46,747
Oh, then I guess our invitations
must've been lost in the mail.

473
00:30:46,953 --> 00:30:48,545
No.

474
00:30:48,788 --> 00:30:52,485
I think it's very possible
she didn't even send us invitations.

475
00:30:54,327 --> 00:30:56,955
-Thanks for stopping by.
-Who's Darren talking to?

476
00:30:57,397 --> 00:30:59,365
Those are his new friends.

477
00:31:02,502 --> 00:31:04,595
-I'll have a merlot.
-A spritzer.

478
00:31:05,304 --> 00:31:08,205
-We don't work here.
-You fooled me.

479
00:31:08,408 --> 00:31:11,070
-My name's Brett, this is Clayton.
-This is Darren.

480
00:31:11,277 --> 00:31:14,212
Yeah, we know who he is, Clayton.

481
00:31:14,414 --> 00:31:18,043
-Darren's our friend, Brett.
-We knew him first.

482
00:31:18,251 --> 00:31:20,082
Fuck you, replacement friend!

483
00:31:20,286 --> 00:31:22,914
Eat this, fake Wayne!

484
00:31:26,993 --> 00:31:28,551
Stop it! Do something!

485
00:31:35,301 --> 00:31:36,325
Get out of here!

486
00:31:43,743 --> 00:31:45,267
Hey, this isn't over yet!

487
00:31:45,478 --> 00:31:47,241
We're not giving up on Darren!

488
00:31:55,021 --> 00:31:57,387
She thinks this gig is over.

489
00:31:57,590 --> 00:31:59,353
It's not over. No!

490
00:31:59,592 --> 00:32:02,925
But we are taking this into overtime!

491
00:32:03,963 --> 00:32:05,988
Yeah! Okay, strategy session.

492
00:32:06,499 --> 00:32:09,662
-Okay, our enemy is wicked.
-Dude, she's Freddy Krueger.

493
00:32:09,869 --> 00:32:11,632
-No, Damien.
-Dude, she's Vader.

494
00:32:11,838 --> 00:32:13,567
No, she is the Emperor!

495
00:32:13,773 --> 00:32:15,263
But with really great tits.

496
00:32:15,475 --> 00:32:18,842
Okay, now, Sandy?
That girl, she's a nice girl.

497
00:32:19,045 --> 00:32:20,945
-She's a sweetheart.
-Dude, a saint.

498
00:32:21,147 --> 00:32:22,444
-A goddess.
-A princess.

499
00:32:22,648 --> 00:32:25,481
You know what?
She's kind of like Mother Teresa.

500
00:32:25,685 --> 00:32:27,243
But with way better tits.

501
00:32:27,453 --> 00:32:30,911
And Darren loves Sandy
no matter what he says.

502
00:32:31,123 --> 00:32:32,090
Definitely.

503
00:32:32,291 --> 00:32:35,260
That's why we have to intervene
and fix the problem!

504
00:32:35,461 --> 00:32:37,486
-Definitely!
-All right!

505
00:32:38,297 --> 00:32:41,892
We're gonna kidnap Judith
and set Darren up with Sandy.

506
00:32:44,637 --> 00:32:45,797
What?

507
00:32:51,644 --> 00:32:54,044
The bat is leaving the cave.

508
00:32:54,814 --> 00:32:56,748
Roger that.

509
00:33:13,733 --> 00:33:17,328
Alarm system has been deactivated.
Out.

510
00:33:17,537 --> 00:33:19,004
Roger that.

511
00:33:19,906 --> 00:33:21,703
Dude, you don't have to do the--

512
00:33:21,908 --> 00:33:24,502
--sound. It already does that. Out.

513
00:33:24,710 --> 00:33:26,701
Copy that.
I'm not going to make the--

514
00:33:26,913 --> 00:33:29,677
--sound after I say stuff
from now on.

515
00:33:31,050 --> 00:33:32,176
Shady McNugent...

516
00:33:32,385 --> 00:33:33,682
...over and out.

517
00:33:34,687 --> 00:33:36,450
That was the last one.

518
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:50,760
-I'm scared. What if we get caught?
-Not gonna happen.

519
00:33:57,076 --> 00:33:58,703
I'm hungry.

520
00:33:59,312 --> 00:34:00,677
We'll eat later.

521
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:04,577
-Can we go to Happy Burger?
-Yes, after the kidnapping.

522
00:34:04,784 --> 00:34:07,082
I'm gonna get a Chubby Checker with--

523
00:34:08,955 --> 00:34:10,547
With cheese.

524
00:34:26,906 --> 00:34:28,339
What?

525
00:34:36,849 --> 00:34:41,115
You go downstairs and I'll check
upstairs. Do the Navy SEAL signals.

526
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:44,255
I only know the Air Force signals.

527
00:34:44,890 --> 00:34:46,482
I'll be on the lookout.

528
00:34:46,759 --> 00:34:47,987
God!

529
00:34:55,935 --> 00:34:58,768
-I haven't located heryet.
-Me neither.

530
00:34:59,405 --> 00:35:00,531
Keep checking.

531
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:05,372
Wait a second. I think I see
something in the back of the refrig--

532
00:35:06,045 --> 00:35:07,603
In the back of the closet.

533
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:09,308
Check it out.

534
00:35:09,782 --> 00:35:11,943
Nope. Coast is clear.

535
00:35:12,151 --> 00:35:16,588
I'll keep looking down here, buddy.
You keep an eye peeled up there.

536
00:35:33,939 --> 00:35:34,997
Oh, shit.

537
00:35:36,842 --> 00:35:37,831
What is it?

538
00:35:38,077 --> 00:35:40,739
I'm hit. I need backup.

539
00:35:41,681 --> 00:35:42,875
I'm coming.

540
00:35:46,318 --> 00:35:47,546
What happ--

541
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:15,707
Help!

542
00:36:31,864 --> 00:36:33,798
Dead leg.

543
00:36:36,035 --> 00:36:37,866
Help me, Wayne.

544
00:36:44,677 --> 00:36:46,144
Oh, my God.

545
00:36:59,325 --> 00:37:02,522
Get the door. Get the door. Door.

546
00:37:33,526 --> 00:37:36,120
Darren, I'm leaving you.
We're finished. Done.

547
00:37:36,462 --> 00:37:38,521
Don't call, write, e-mail or fax.

548
00:37:38,731 --> 00:37:41,859
I never want to see your face
oryour fake butt again.

549
00:38:13,265 --> 00:38:14,425
Okay, get down there.

550
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,968
Dude, wait. Why me?

551
00:38:17,169 --> 00:38:21,071
Because you're guarding Judith.
I'm dealing with Darren and Sandy.

552
00:38:21,273 --> 00:38:24,333
But when we let her go,
she'll be able to identify me.

553
00:38:24,577 --> 00:38:28,274
No. She won't be able to
because you'll be wearing this.

554
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:32,507
But after we let her go, the cops will
look for a guy dressed as a bird.

555
00:38:32,751 --> 00:38:34,981
-So?
-So, what am I gonna wear to work?

556
00:38:35,187 --> 00:38:36,381
Your work clothes.

557
00:38:36,589 --> 00:38:38,648
But tomorrow's casual Friday.

558
00:38:39,191 --> 00:38:41,421
Get downstairs!

559
00:38:48,067 --> 00:38:49,364
Who the hell are you?

560
00:39:09,655 --> 00:39:12,453
Thanks for meeting me.
I called you out of the blue--

561
00:39:12,658 --> 00:39:16,617
That's okay. I love catching up
with old high school friends.

562
00:39:16,829 --> 00:39:18,660
-Are you single?
-Yes.

563
00:39:18,864 --> 00:39:22,994
Great. Look, I wanted to talk
to you about Darren Silverman.

564
00:39:23,202 --> 00:39:24,601
He's a really good guy.

565
00:39:24,837 --> 00:39:27,704
You know what?
He works with the elderly.

566
00:39:27,907 --> 00:39:29,169
Really?

567
00:39:29,508 --> 00:39:32,739
-That is so sweet.
-He still talks about you.

568
00:39:32,945 --> 00:39:33,934
There's something--

569
00:39:34,179 --> 00:39:37,740
He even writes poems about you.
In fact...

570
00:39:38,250 --> 00:39:39,512
...I think he loves you.

571
00:39:40,019 --> 00:39:42,419
Wayne, I'm gonna become a nun.

572
00:39:44,790 --> 00:39:46,985
In a week, I take my final vows.

573
00:39:47,192 --> 00:39:50,593
I didn't even know
that you were religious.

574
00:39:50,796 --> 00:39:52,423
I wasn't in high school.

575
00:39:52,631 --> 00:39:56,397
But after I graduated,
I joined my parents in the circus.

576
00:39:56,602 --> 00:39:58,263
And I became a trapeze artist.

577
00:40:00,439 --> 00:40:02,907
I fell in love
with mypartner, Luigi Panini.

578
00:40:03,108 --> 00:40:07,067
Ladies and gentlemen,
the fabulous Luigi!

579
00:40:07,313 --> 00:40:10,043
And everything was perfect until....

580
00:40:10,249 --> 00:40:12,444
Talent scouts were in the audience.

581
00:40:12,751 --> 00:40:14,776
Luigi wanted to impress them.

582
00:40:14,987 --> 00:40:18,286
He was a great trapeze artist,
but he was completely vain.

583
00:40:18,490 --> 00:40:21,357
And now Luigi will attempt
the most dangerous stunt...

584
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:23,187
...in the history of trapeze...

585
00:40:23,395 --> 00:40:26,057
...the Quadruple Bierman.

586
00:40:41,780 --> 00:40:43,771
Luigi!

587
00:40:46,085 --> 00:40:48,144
-Wow.
-Yeah.

588
00:40:48,354 --> 00:40:52,484
After Luigi died,
I knew I would never love again.

589
00:40:52,691 --> 00:40:57,355
That's when I decided to devote my life
to serving God and helping others.

590
00:40:57,596 --> 00:41:01,498
So you haven't taken
your final vows yet, right?

591
00:41:01,934 --> 00:41:06,701
-Right.
-So technically, you're not a nun yet.

592
00:41:06,939 --> 00:41:09,305
Well, no. I mean, not yet.

593
00:41:09,508 --> 00:41:12,272
So why not then just
have lunch with Darren?

594
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:16,841
I can't figure out why Judith left.

595
00:41:17,049 --> 00:41:20,507
It doesn't make any sense.
She didn't even take her clothes.

596
00:41:20,719 --> 00:41:24,587
Maybe she went where she didn't
need clothes: a nudist colony.

597
00:41:24,790 --> 00:41:27,156
-I don't think so.
-Maybe she got kidnapped.

598
00:41:27,693 --> 00:41:29,558
-You think?
-No.

599
00:41:29,795 --> 00:41:31,888
Definitely not. That's impossible.

600
00:41:32,131 --> 00:41:35,396
It's like, why would that
happen in a world?

601
00:41:35,768 --> 00:41:37,429
Maybe she's a lesbo.

602
00:41:37,903 --> 00:41:38,801
Come on.

603
00:41:39,004 --> 00:41:41,097
Maybe she's a herm.

604
00:41:42,474 --> 00:41:44,465
-What?
-A hermaphrodite.

605
00:41:44,676 --> 00:41:46,701
Little dick, little puss.

606
00:41:50,449 --> 00:41:52,747
-Guess who I bumped into today.
-Who?

607
00:41:52,951 --> 00:41:56,478
Sandy Perkus,
and she wants to see you.

608
00:41:56,688 --> 00:41:59,521
-I'm engaged to Judith, Wayne.
-She dumped you, dude.

609
00:41:59,725 --> 00:42:02,694
Just have lunch with Sandy.
What's it gonna hurt?

610
00:42:02,895 --> 00:42:05,455
No way. Judith's coming back.

611
00:42:06,065 --> 00:42:07,396
What if she doesn't?

612
00:42:07,633 --> 00:42:10,625
As long as Judith's alive,
I'll never give up on her.

613
00:42:10,836 --> 00:42:12,463
Okay? Okay?

614
00:42:17,876 --> 00:42:20,902
I got it. Crowbar me.

615
00:42:24,049 --> 00:42:25,141
Oh, my God.

616
00:42:25,417 --> 00:42:28,716
-What is it?
-This dead chick is really stacked.

617
00:42:34,093 --> 00:42:35,583
Okay, go, go. Go.

618
00:42:37,096 --> 00:42:39,064
-What are you doing?
-Jacket's caught.

619
00:42:39,264 --> 00:42:40,424
Take it off!

620
00:42:40,666 --> 00:42:42,258
I love this jacket!

621
00:42:43,001 --> 00:42:43,990
Lose it!

622
00:43:01,019 --> 00:43:05,012
Damn! That was my favorite jacket.

623
00:43:08,927 --> 00:43:11,953
In a bizarre incident last night,
Judith Fessbeggler...

624
00:43:12,164 --> 00:43:14,962
...was incinerated beyond
recognition when herBMW...

625
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:16,929
...careened offa cliff.

626
00:43:17,136 --> 00:43:21,539
Investigators have declared it an
accident. No foul play is suspected.

627
00:43:23,542 --> 00:43:26,978
In unrelated news, the body of
deceased local Joan Snerd...

628
00:43:27,212 --> 00:43:31,808
...was dug up in a grave robbing last
night. Police arrested three Cubans.

629
00:43:43,328 --> 00:43:46,456
-Why are you doing this?
-So you can eat and have clothes.

630
00:43:47,432 --> 00:43:49,161
No, why did you kidnap me?

631
00:43:49,401 --> 00:43:51,232
I'm not supposed to tell you.

632
00:43:51,503 --> 00:43:54,233
Oh, I get it.
The other guy's the boss.

633
00:43:55,807 --> 00:43:58,674
No, I make decisions too.

634
00:43:59,011 --> 00:44:00,740
I suggested that.

635
00:44:01,313 --> 00:44:02,712
An outhouse. Clever.

636
00:44:02,915 --> 00:44:03,882
Thanks.

637
00:44:04,082 --> 00:44:06,710
-You must be very well-educated.
-I suppose.

638
00:44:06,919 --> 00:44:08,910
-Ivy League?
-More or less.

639
00:44:09,121 --> 00:44:12,181
-Which one? Yale, Harvard, Princeton?
-S.U.

640
00:44:12,424 --> 00:44:13,857
Oh, Stanford University?

641
00:44:16,128 --> 00:44:18,119
Subway University.

642
00:44:18,330 --> 00:44:22,266
I knew someone who went there.
Did you know J.D. McNugent?

643
00:44:22,467 --> 00:44:26,335
No. No. Never heard
of such a person, ever.

644
00:44:27,873 --> 00:44:30,865
-See you later, J.D.
-Take it easy, Judith.

645
00:44:32,778 --> 00:44:34,405
Goddamn it!

646
00:44:34,613 --> 00:44:38,014
-She knows who we are?!
-There was nothing I could do.

647
00:44:38,217 --> 00:44:41,744
She used her super-intellect on me.
She's like Hannibal Lecter.

648
00:44:41,954 --> 00:44:45,788
-Great. Now we can't let her go.
-So, what are we going to do?

649
00:44:47,326 --> 00:44:48,588
-Coach.
-Coach!

650
00:44:48,794 --> 00:44:51,422
If it ain't my favorite
third-string quarterback...

651
00:44:51,630 --> 00:44:54,622
...and the best damn mascot
Wheaton High School ever had.

652
00:44:54,833 --> 00:44:56,698
Lookit, he's still got it!

653
00:44:58,036 --> 00:45:01,528
It's good seeing you boys.
Thank you for coming to my trial.

654
00:45:01,740 --> 00:45:05,141
No problem. We were happy to act
as witnesses on your behalf.

655
00:45:05,344 --> 00:45:07,972
That ref blew.
He deserved what he got.

656
00:45:11,850 --> 00:45:13,147
Touchdown!

657
00:45:13,518 --> 00:45:15,884
No touchdown. He's out-of-bounds.

658
00:45:16,321 --> 00:45:17,913
-What?!
-He's out-of-bounds.

659
00:45:32,571 --> 00:45:37,372
You think after you get out of prison
they'll let you get your old job back?

660
00:45:37,576 --> 00:45:40,340
Well, boys, I don't think so.

661
00:45:40,545 --> 00:45:42,308
So when will they let you out?

662
00:45:42,514 --> 00:45:46,041
Well, I've got an appeal pending,
but it doesn't look good.

663
00:45:46,251 --> 00:45:49,345
The victim's whiny
family's protesting.

664
00:45:49,554 --> 00:45:51,613
What's their damn problem?

665
00:45:52,224 --> 00:45:53,987
So, what brings you boys here?

666
00:45:54,192 --> 00:45:56,251
Well, coach, we need your advice.

667
00:45:56,461 --> 00:45:57,758
Okay, shoot.

668
00:45:57,963 --> 00:46:00,523
Darren fell in love
with this girl, Judith.

669
00:46:00,732 --> 00:46:03,758
-And we kidnapped her.
-Kill her.

670
00:46:04,369 --> 00:46:06,564
Wait a minute and let me finish.

671
00:46:06,772 --> 00:46:10,299
So we screwed up because now
she knows who we are.

672
00:46:10,542 --> 00:46:13,636
So we can't let her go,
or she'll turn us in.

673
00:46:13,879 --> 00:46:15,437
Is that everything?

674
00:46:18,383 --> 00:46:19,645
Kill her.

675
00:46:20,719 --> 00:46:22,186
We can't kill her.

676
00:46:22,387 --> 00:46:26,016
You can! Wheaton Warbirds can do
anything they put their minds to.

677
00:46:26,224 --> 00:46:29,489
But, coach, I mean, come on,
actually kill a person?

678
00:46:29,928 --> 00:46:32,453
What is it that I always said?

679
00:46:32,664 --> 00:46:35,189
If you can dream it, you can do it.

680
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:36,458
Exactly.

681
00:46:36,668 --> 00:46:40,866
You have the dream. All you have
to do is turn it into reality.

682
00:46:41,073 --> 00:46:42,700
-Okay.
-Thattaboy!

683
00:46:42,941 --> 00:46:44,806
Now, go on home and snuff her.

684
00:46:45,010 --> 00:46:47,240
-Come on, move.
-Thanks, coach.

685
00:46:53,051 --> 00:46:54,518
Where's your bird suit?

686
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:57,484
I don't need it, because we're--

687
00:46:58,824 --> 00:47:01,725
Because we're gonna kill you. Right?

688
00:47:03,829 --> 00:47:05,729
You aren't going to shoot me.

689
00:47:05,931 --> 00:47:07,330
What makes you say that?

690
00:47:07,699 --> 00:47:09,223
Because you're not killers.

691
00:47:09,434 --> 00:47:10,526
Sure we are.

692
00:47:10,736 --> 00:47:12,169
You've never killed anyone.

693
00:47:12,371 --> 00:47:13,360
I killed a man once.

694
00:47:13,572 --> 00:47:14,539
-Oh, really?
-Yeah.

695
00:47:14,740 --> 00:47:17,334
-Who?
-Kevin Beckley.

696
00:47:17,542 --> 00:47:20,511
You didn't kill Kevin Beckley.
He died in a car wreck.

697
00:47:21,847 --> 00:47:24,873
-She doesn't know that. Goddamn it.
-You see?

698
00:47:25,083 --> 00:47:28,484
You guys have never killed anything
in your entire lives.

699
00:47:28,687 --> 00:47:32,851
One time, this squirrel ran out
into the street and I ran over him...

700
00:47:33,058 --> 00:47:37,586
...and he didn't die right then, but
I'm pretty sure he died right after.

701
00:47:38,296 --> 00:47:42,255
It doesn't matter if we've killed
or not! We're gonna do it right now!

702
00:47:42,467 --> 00:47:44,697
-Ready?!
-Ready.

703
00:47:46,905 --> 00:47:49,169
-Do it.
-I can't!

704
00:47:49,374 --> 00:47:50,773
Goddamn it!

705
00:47:59,951 --> 00:48:02,476
-Okay, it's Tuesday.
-So?

706
00:48:02,721 --> 00:48:04,780
So you're meeting Sandy for lunch.

707
00:48:04,990 --> 00:48:06,617
Can't you see I'm in mourning?

708
00:48:06,825 --> 00:48:10,283
But you promised you'd be there.
You gave her your word.

709
00:48:10,762 --> 00:48:12,457
I didn't even talk to her.

710
00:48:12,664 --> 00:48:14,894
Okay, I gave her your word.

711
00:48:15,100 --> 00:48:19,730
For God's sakes, when will you give up
this idea that I'll go out with Sandy?

712
00:48:19,938 --> 00:48:22,236
When you go out with Sandy.

713
00:48:23,842 --> 00:48:25,503
Now, come on.

714
00:48:26,478 --> 00:48:29,606
Come on. Come on. Come on, come on.

715
00:48:39,324 --> 00:48:41,849
Come on! All right! Come on!

716
00:48:46,331 --> 00:48:48,993
Hey! Wow, you're wearing the--

717
00:48:49,201 --> 00:48:51,431
I'm training to become a nun.

718
00:48:51,636 --> 00:48:54,104
A nun. Well, that explains it.

719
00:48:54,606 --> 00:48:57,439
-I hope it doesn't freak you out.
-No, it doesn't.

720
00:48:57,642 --> 00:48:59,906
Actually, I'm relieved.

721
00:49:00,111 --> 00:49:04,104
I think Wayne was trying
to set us up on a date.

722
00:49:04,316 --> 00:49:07,843
Oh, yeah.
He's got some crazy ideas.

723
00:49:08,053 --> 00:49:12,319
Yeah. Well, now that I know
that you're unavailable...

724
00:49:12,524 --> 00:49:13,855
...it makes this easier.

725
00:49:14,059 --> 00:49:15,549
We can just be friends.

726
00:49:15,794 --> 00:49:17,227
Exactly. Friends.

727
00:49:17,896 --> 00:49:19,124
Please.

728
00:49:19,698 --> 00:49:21,563
-Thank you.
-Sure.

729
00:49:22,901 --> 00:49:24,459
So how are your parents?

730
00:49:24,669 --> 00:49:27,763
Oh, great. They're making
a fortune on the lnternet.

731
00:49:27,973 --> 00:49:30,737
They started their own Web site,
circusfreak.com.

732
00:49:31,543 --> 00:49:32,908
Wow, good for them.

733
00:49:33,245 --> 00:49:35,270
And how's your brother, Dog-face Boy?

734
00:49:35,480 --> 00:49:36,879
He got rabies.

735
00:49:37,315 --> 00:49:39,283
-God, that's too bad.
-Yeah.

736
00:49:39,484 --> 00:49:42,419
We thought we were gonna
have to put him down...

737
00:49:42,621 --> 00:49:44,179
...but he recovered.

738
00:49:44,389 --> 00:49:46,186
Oh, good. Good.

739
00:49:46,391 --> 00:49:47,790
So how are you?

740
00:49:47,993 --> 00:49:50,325
Oh, me? I'm great.

741
00:49:50,562 --> 00:49:53,963
Yeah, everything's been
really good, you know?

742
00:49:54,165 --> 00:49:55,462
Yeah.

743
00:49:56,935 --> 00:49:58,800
Well, my fiancée died.

744
00:49:59,070 --> 00:50:00,094
She died?

745
00:50:00,305 --> 00:50:01,272
Yeah, she's dead.

746
00:50:01,473 --> 00:50:03,464
-I am so sorry.
-Oh, don't be.

747
00:50:03,675 --> 00:50:05,905
Please don't be sorry.

748
00:50:06,411 --> 00:50:08,140
It's nothing.

749
00:50:09,447 --> 00:50:12,143
So how do you feel about....

750
00:50:17,022 --> 00:50:18,421
Oh, no.

751
00:50:18,623 --> 00:50:23,219
Oh, gosh. Just cry. Let it out.

752
00:50:23,428 --> 00:50:26,625
I'm here for you, okay?
I'm here for you.

753
00:50:26,831 --> 00:50:28,093
Thank you.

754
00:50:38,109 --> 00:50:42,136
Wait a minute. Wait.
You're a Neil Diamond fan too?

755
00:50:42,347 --> 00:50:44,941
Oh! The man's a genius.

756
00:50:45,150 --> 00:50:46,515
Yeah!

757
00:50:46,718 --> 00:50:50,415
He's the greatest songwriter-performer
of this or any generation.

758
00:50:50,622 --> 00:50:51,611
I know.

759
00:51:04,502 --> 00:51:06,129
Oh, God.

760
00:51:13,378 --> 00:51:15,073
I brought you some more videos.

761
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:17,714
You got your choice:
Porno or monster trucks.

762
00:51:17,916 --> 00:51:19,941
-And I got one that's both.
-Thanks, J.D.

763
00:51:20,151 --> 00:51:22,915
I really appreciate you
taking care of me.

764
00:51:23,455 --> 00:51:24,444
My pleasure.

765
00:51:24,656 --> 00:51:28,114
Hey, you strike me as
a pretty responsible guy.

766
00:51:28,326 --> 00:51:29,315
Thanks.

767
00:51:29,527 --> 00:51:33,054
That's why I'm surprised
that you let Wayne boss you around.

768
00:51:34,966 --> 00:51:35,990
Wayne's not--

769
00:51:36,201 --> 00:51:39,659
No one bosses me around.
Wayne's not the boss of me.

770
00:51:40,038 --> 00:51:44,031
Yeah. I think that you
seem depressed and confused.

771
00:51:44,242 --> 00:51:45,641
You think?

772
00:51:45,844 --> 00:51:48,438
You have a self-defeating
personality disorder.

773
00:51:50,615 --> 00:51:52,344
Have you considered therapy?

774
00:51:54,452 --> 00:51:58,218
I remember in high school, you were
really into helping people.

775
00:51:58,423 --> 00:52:01,221
At parties, you were always
the designated driver.

776
00:52:01,426 --> 00:52:04,361
Right. And I remember you
were a really good dancer.

777
00:52:04,562 --> 00:52:08,464
And strong too. You used to be
able to lift me up over your head.

778
00:52:08,667 --> 00:52:10,066
Still can.

779
00:52:10,301 --> 00:52:11,632
Oh, really?

780
00:52:12,470 --> 00:52:14,631
Ready? And....

781
00:52:19,044 --> 00:52:20,534
-Oh, Darren!
-Help me!

782
00:52:20,745 --> 00:52:22,372
Are you okay?

783
00:52:22,580 --> 00:52:23,808
-I can't--
-Just hang on.

784
00:52:25,917 --> 00:52:27,145
I can't swim.

785
00:52:43,735 --> 00:52:44,895
Darren!

786
00:52:45,870 --> 00:52:47,428
Are you okay?

787
00:52:47,672 --> 00:52:50,766
Thank you. Thank you for saving me.

788
00:52:52,510 --> 00:52:54,102
No problem.

789
00:53:03,254 --> 00:53:07,020
Let it out now. There you go.

790
00:53:09,194 --> 00:53:10,183
Come on.

791
00:53:10,462 --> 00:53:11,759
Let's go, okay?

792
00:53:15,600 --> 00:53:18,330
You're a lot stronger
than you were in high school.

793
00:53:18,536 --> 00:53:21,937
Yeah, well, the convent's
got a great gym.

794
00:53:25,343 --> 00:53:28,244
And ever since then,
I've been afraid of toilets.

795
00:53:28,446 --> 00:53:30,744
What else can I say
about second grade?

796
00:53:30,949 --> 00:53:32,610
J.D., let's fast-forward.

797
00:53:32,817 --> 00:53:35,684
-Have you ever had a girlfriend?
-Yes.

798
00:53:35,887 --> 00:53:36,876
No.

799
00:53:37,122 --> 00:53:40,182
Have you ever fantasized
about having sex with a man?

800
00:53:40,391 --> 00:53:41,858
-Which man?
-Any man.

801
00:53:42,060 --> 00:53:44,358
-You mean, like, a tall man?
-Sure, whatever.

802
00:53:44,562 --> 00:53:47,360
-I don't like tall people.
-How about a short man?

803
00:53:47,632 --> 00:53:52,035
How short? Sometimes people can be
too short. That's weird, like midgets.

804
00:53:52,370 --> 00:53:56,101
Have you fantasized about having
sex with any man? Any man at all?

805
00:53:56,307 --> 00:53:58,639
Does that include celebrities?

806
00:54:00,979 --> 00:54:03,038
-Can I ask you something?
-Sure.

807
00:54:03,248 --> 00:54:07,241
I mean, not that it matters now...

808
00:54:07,852 --> 00:54:12,653
...but if I had asked you out back
in high school, would you have gone?

809
00:54:13,691 --> 00:54:15,124
Definitely.

810
00:54:16,494 --> 00:54:19,554
-Not that it matters now, you know.
-Right.

811
00:54:24,569 --> 00:54:26,503
-Perfect.
-Thanks.

812
00:54:27,472 --> 00:54:29,838
Could you, you know, turn around?

813
00:54:30,041 --> 00:54:31,531
Right. Yeah, certainly.

814
00:54:40,351 --> 00:54:42,012
I have these.

815
00:54:43,721 --> 00:54:45,746
Sorry, sorry, those are....

816
00:54:46,324 --> 00:54:47,256
Thanks.

817
00:55:00,071 --> 00:55:02,471
-Can you zip me up?
-Yeah.

818
00:55:05,543 --> 00:55:07,374
I had a really good time.

819
00:55:07,579 --> 00:55:08,841
Me too.

820
00:55:09,047 --> 00:55:11,538
-Do you want to have dinner tonight?
-I can't.

821
00:55:11,749 --> 00:55:14,513
Tomorrow I have a test in my
catechism class...

822
00:55:14,719 --> 00:55:19,520
...and I have to score at least an 85
so I can take my vows on Sunday.

823
00:55:19,824 --> 00:55:21,086
What about tomorrow?

824
00:55:21,292 --> 00:55:25,626
I'm scheduled to take care
of an elderly nun on her death bed.

825
00:55:26,030 --> 00:55:27,361
I understand.

826
00:55:27,565 --> 00:55:29,897
But I'd really like to see you again.

827
00:55:31,035 --> 00:55:32,593
I'll get out of it.

828
00:55:33,104 --> 00:55:33,137
I always knew I was different,
and now I know why.

829
00:55:33,137 --> 00:55:36,402
I always knew I was different,
and now I know why.

830
00:55:36,608 --> 00:55:38,599
I'm gay.

831
00:55:39,544 --> 00:55:43,708
You're the only person
who's ever truly understood me.

832
00:55:43,915 --> 00:55:46,713
It's okay. Just let it out.

833
00:55:46,918 --> 00:55:48,749
Everything will be all right.

834
00:55:48,953 --> 00:55:51,513
It's all gonna be okay.

835
00:55:51,723 --> 00:55:53,384
It's gonna be just--

836
00:56:31,829 --> 00:56:33,854
Judith escaped.

837
00:56:34,866 --> 00:56:35,890
Der!

838
00:56:40,772 --> 00:56:44,799
Get to the truck. Go. Go. Go. Go.

839
00:56:58,056 --> 00:57:00,524
Okay, she can't be far.

840
00:57:02,260 --> 00:57:03,249
I see her!

841
00:57:03,461 --> 00:57:05,088
Where? Okay, steady, steady!

842
00:57:07,899 --> 00:57:08,991
I missed her.

843
00:57:14,572 --> 00:57:16,403
Now. Let's go. Go, go!

844
00:57:16,641 --> 00:57:18,871
You go this way,
I'll go that way! Go!

845
00:57:28,019 --> 00:57:30,613
Open up! I've been kidnapped!

846
00:57:32,957 --> 00:57:34,322
Hold your goddamn horses!

847
00:57:34,759 --> 00:57:36,124
Oh, thank God. Hurry up.

848
00:57:40,865 --> 00:57:43,265
Tonight Mr. Chang gets lucky.

849
00:57:45,470 --> 00:57:47,631
Young lady, so horny, so impatient.

850
00:57:52,477 --> 00:57:54,809
Oh, scrotum!

851
00:57:56,714 --> 00:57:59,376
Dude, she's stealing the truck!
Come on!

852
00:58:03,287 --> 00:58:05,778
-Now! I got her.
-Do her! Come on!

853
00:58:06,090 --> 00:58:07,648
I got her.

854
00:58:17,168 --> 00:58:19,159
Okay, Judith, it's over.

855
00:58:19,404 --> 00:58:23,067
You might as well turn around
and head back to the house.

856
00:58:35,686 --> 00:58:36,675
Oh, thank God.

857
00:58:59,811 --> 00:59:02,712
Hi, officers. You're safe.

858
00:59:03,114 --> 00:59:04,911
I'm Cowboy Wayne.

859
00:59:05,383 --> 00:59:08,580
I just bagged me
one of them killer goats...

860
00:59:08,786 --> 00:59:11,448
...that escaped from the zoo.

861
00:59:12,356 --> 00:59:14,051
-Good job.
-Yeah.

862
00:59:14,292 --> 00:59:16,954
Okay, then, I'll see you later.

863
00:59:30,074 --> 00:59:32,440
There. That should
hold you for tonight.

864
00:59:33,644 --> 00:59:34,906
Don't!

865
00:59:40,084 --> 00:59:41,915
What the hell happened?

866
00:59:42,920 --> 00:59:44,888
Judith was giving me some therapy...

867
00:59:45,089 --> 00:59:47,557
...and helped me realize
I was gay and--

868
00:59:47,825 --> 00:59:49,349
Wait. What?

869
00:59:50,328 --> 00:59:51,659
I see what happened.

870
00:59:52,697 --> 00:59:54,426
She messed with your head.

871
00:59:54,665 --> 00:59:56,292
Wayne, I'm gay.

872
00:59:56,501 --> 00:59:59,959
No, you're not.
You're just unsuccessful with women.

873
01:00:00,171 --> 01:00:04,403
No, I'm gay. Judith got me
in touch with the inner J.D.

874
01:00:04,609 --> 01:00:05,735
How'd she do that?

875
01:00:05,943 --> 01:00:07,410
She listened.

876
01:00:07,845 --> 01:00:12,782
Unlike people who knew me for years
and ignored all the telltale signs.

877
01:00:12,984 --> 01:00:15,748
-Like what?
-Like my obsession with Bette Midler.

878
01:00:15,953 --> 01:00:17,784
My preference for track lighting.

879
01:00:17,989 --> 01:00:20,753
And the fact that I like sucking dick.

880
01:00:20,992 --> 01:00:23,358
What?! You've done that?!

881
01:00:24,061 --> 01:00:27,997
Not with another guy, but remember
when I bought that book on yoga?

882
01:00:28,199 --> 01:00:29,894
I don't want to hear anymore.

883
01:00:30,101 --> 01:00:33,537
Look, you want to be gay?
Fine! No problem!

884
01:00:33,738 --> 01:00:36,536
But from now on,
I'll take care of Judith myself.

885
01:00:36,741 --> 01:00:37,969
Okay!

886
01:00:42,613 --> 01:00:45,047
-You want to be gay with me?
-No!

887
01:00:50,188 --> 01:00:51,849
Come on, go, come on.

888
01:00:52,056 --> 01:00:54,684
All you, all you! Eleven. Okay.

889
01:00:54,892 --> 01:00:57,952
One more. One more.
Come on. One more.

890
01:00:58,996 --> 01:01:00,896
Feel the burn. Come on, now.

891
01:01:03,167 --> 01:01:04,361
Eleven.

892
01:01:05,336 --> 01:01:06,564
What's the matter, dear?

893
01:01:07,205 --> 01:01:11,039
You never used to be so winded
after only five sets.

894
01:01:11,242 --> 01:01:13,574
Well, Mother Superior...

895
01:01:14,412 --> 01:01:19,111
...I'm having some second thoughts
about becoming a nun.

896
01:01:19,684 --> 01:01:21,117
Oh, don't get me wrong.

897
01:01:21,319 --> 01:01:24,550
This is a terrific convent. But I--

898
01:01:24,755 --> 01:01:25,983
But....

899
01:01:26,257 --> 01:01:27,246
Well...

900
01:01:28,426 --> 01:01:31,793
...I'm having these feelings.

901
01:01:32,029 --> 01:01:33,428
What kind of feelings?

902
01:01:37,401 --> 01:01:39,392
You mean sexual feelings.

903
01:01:41,172 --> 01:01:43,470
Yeah, but it's so much more than that.

904
01:01:43,674 --> 01:01:44,698
Yes, well...

905
01:01:45,209 --> 01:01:46,608
...my dear...

906
01:01:47,078 --> 01:01:51,481
...you're the only one who can decide
if this is the life you want to live.

907
01:01:51,682 --> 01:01:54,116
But once you take your final vows...

908
01:01:55,419 --> 01:01:57,649
...there is no going back.

909
01:01:58,556 --> 01:02:02,014
Now, let's go bust out
some power squats.

910
01:02:16,207 --> 01:02:21,042
There. That should keep you
from escaping again. And this....

911
01:02:23,214 --> 01:02:24,374
This....

912
01:02:24,949 --> 01:02:26,883
This should keep you from biting.

913
01:02:27,752 --> 01:02:30,482
-How am I gonna eat?
-I thought of that.

914
01:02:31,756 --> 01:02:33,314
-What is that?
-It's breakfast.

915
01:02:33,557 --> 01:02:36,617
It's pancakes, sausage,
hash brown, Pop Tart, puréed.

916
01:02:36,827 --> 01:02:38,988
I won't eat it. I want a Big Montana.

917
01:02:39,196 --> 01:02:41,528
A Big Montana from Arby's
with curly fries.

918
01:02:41,732 --> 01:02:46,032
I won't get you one. If you won't eat
what I made for you, you can starve!

919
01:02:46,737 --> 01:02:48,568
Why are you doing this?!

920
01:02:48,773 --> 01:02:50,638
To save our friendship.

921
01:02:50,841 --> 01:02:53,810
Friendship? It seems like
you're in love with Darren.

922
01:02:54,178 --> 01:02:55,475
Bullshit!

923
01:02:55,680 --> 01:02:58,877
Just get over it.
Your buddy smokes pole and so do you.

924
01:02:59,884 --> 01:03:01,545
I am so un-gay!

925
01:03:01,752 --> 01:03:05,552
Let's pretend you're straight.
When's the last time you got any?

926
01:03:05,756 --> 01:03:07,121
None of your business.

927
01:03:07,658 --> 01:03:08,716
So it's been years?

928
01:03:09,427 --> 01:03:12,658
-I'm waiting for the right woman.
-There is no right woman.

929
01:03:12,863 --> 01:03:17,323
If there was, you've already met
and she's killed herself or become gay.

930
01:03:17,768 --> 01:03:19,599
-Bite me!
-Blow me!

931
01:03:19,837 --> 01:03:21,099
-Skank!
-Eunuch!

932
01:03:21,572 --> 01:03:24,769
Stealer of my friend!

933
01:03:32,450 --> 01:03:34,418
What happened to your head?

934
01:03:38,055 --> 01:03:39,682
I saw Judith.

935
01:03:40,191 --> 01:03:41,624
Judith's dead.

936
01:03:41,859 --> 01:03:43,190
Yeah, but...

937
01:03:43,427 --> 01:03:45,520
...I could've sworn it was her.

938
01:03:45,730 --> 01:03:48,255
-I was on--
-You poor thing.

939
01:03:48,466 --> 01:03:50,263
You're still not over her death.

940
01:03:50,735 --> 01:03:53,329
Maybe we shouldn't be
seeing each other.

941
01:03:54,038 --> 01:03:57,633
No. No. God, I'm fine.

942
01:03:57,875 --> 01:04:00,537
And, look, I can deal
with this. Okay?

943
01:04:04,715 --> 01:04:07,411
-So, what are you having?
-Let's see.

944
01:04:07,618 --> 01:04:10,746
There's the duck.
That was always Judith's favorite.

945
01:04:10,955 --> 01:04:12,513
-I'm sorry.
-I should leave.

946
01:04:12,723 --> 01:04:14,782
No, you shouldn't. I'm so sorry.

947
01:04:14,992 --> 01:04:18,291
I will never mention
Judith's name again, really.

948
01:04:18,496 --> 01:04:20,293
I swear. I swear.

949
01:04:23,234 --> 01:04:25,202
Would you excuse me for a moment?

950
01:04:25,770 --> 01:04:29,069
Please. I'll be right back. Okay?

951
01:04:29,273 --> 01:04:31,207
In a-- In a moment.

952
01:04:37,515 --> 01:04:38,914
Damn it!

953
01:04:42,920 --> 01:04:45,411
-What do you want?!
-Wayne, it's me, Darren.

954
01:04:45,823 --> 01:04:50,055
I have a problem. I'm with Sandy,
but I can't stop talking about Judith.

955
01:04:50,528 --> 01:04:52,826
Okay. I'll be right there.

956
01:05:05,109 --> 01:05:07,077
Okay, open up your shirt.

957
01:05:07,278 --> 01:05:08,973
-Why?
-Just do it.

958
01:05:10,114 --> 01:05:11,809
What is this?

959
01:05:13,951 --> 01:05:14,940
Now...

960
01:05:15,619 --> 01:05:17,450
...here's what's gonna happen.

961
01:05:19,390 --> 01:05:22,518
I'm going to listen
to your conversation.

962
01:05:23,360 --> 01:05:24,452
Now...

963
01:05:25,463 --> 01:05:28,626
...if you say anything about Judith...

964
01:05:29,133 --> 01:05:31,693
...or so much as mention her name...

965
01:05:31,902 --> 01:05:34,530
...then I'll give you a little shock.

966
01:05:36,540 --> 01:05:37,802
Perfect.

967
01:05:39,543 --> 01:05:43,070
I don't think I'm comfortable
having these things on my nipples.

968
01:05:43,280 --> 01:05:44,975
I could put them on your balls.

969
01:05:45,316 --> 01:05:47,648
The nipples are fine. Nipples work.

970
01:05:50,321 --> 01:05:54,087
Hi. Sorry, sorry, sorry.
I'm back. I am back.

971
01:05:54,325 --> 01:05:57,817
There was a talkative
men's room attendant.

972
01:05:58,162 --> 01:05:59,151
That's okay.

973
01:06:13,244 --> 01:06:14,802
-Excuse me.
-Hey.

974
01:06:15,012 --> 01:06:17,071
-This table's reserved.
-You know what?

975
01:06:17,281 --> 01:06:20,079
I come here all the time,
and spend a lot of money...

976
01:06:20,284 --> 01:06:22,479
...so why not leave me the hell alone?

977
01:06:25,189 --> 01:06:27,248
I don't mean to be pushy...

978
01:06:27,458 --> 01:06:30,188
...but if this relationship
is gonna get serious...

979
01:06:30,394 --> 01:06:32,294
...I have to give up becoming a nun...

980
01:06:32,696 --> 01:06:34,857
...and I'd have to decide soon...

981
01:06:35,533 --> 01:06:37,694
...because my final vows
are on Sunday.

982
01:06:38,269 --> 01:06:40,464
Yeah, that thought had occurred to me.

983
01:06:40,704 --> 01:06:42,194
And if I do that...

984
01:06:42,406 --> 01:06:46,536
...I need to know that
you want marriage and a family.

985
01:06:47,711 --> 01:06:48,700
Absolutely.

986
01:06:50,881 --> 01:06:54,715
I never thought I'd say this to anyone
after Luigi died, but...

987
01:06:55,753 --> 01:06:57,277
...I love you, Darren.

988
01:07:01,091 --> 01:07:02,524
I love you too, Judith.

989
01:07:05,362 --> 01:07:07,660
-Judith?!
-I mean Sandy.

990
01:07:07,865 --> 01:07:11,596
I mean, let's dance. Okay?

991
01:07:20,311 --> 01:07:21,403
You're out of here.

992
01:07:21,612 --> 01:07:24,137
Put me down! I haven't ordered yet!

993
01:07:27,585 --> 01:07:30,110
Time for an attitude
adjustment, mister.

994
01:07:33,424 --> 01:07:35,255
Hey, nice move.

995
01:07:43,267 --> 01:07:44,359
Damn, he's good.

996
01:07:46,236 --> 01:07:47,396
Darren!

997
01:07:52,509 --> 01:07:53,498
Oh, my God!

998
01:07:53,844 --> 01:07:56,108
Oh, jeez. Oh, my God!

999
01:07:59,149 --> 01:08:01,208
Are you okay?

1000
01:08:02,786 --> 01:08:04,219
It was a little weird.

1001
01:08:17,334 --> 01:08:19,063
-What's going on?
-I can explain.

1002
01:08:19,470 --> 01:08:24,100
It's aversion therapy. Wayne was
trying to help me get over Judith...

1003
01:08:24,308 --> 01:08:26,503
...so I had these things-- Nipples--

1004
01:08:26,710 --> 01:08:30,077
Oh, my God.
It's so much worse than I thought.

1005
01:08:30,280 --> 01:08:33,807
No, you're obviously not ready
for this relationship.

1006
01:08:34,985 --> 01:08:36,885
No, I am! Sandy, wait!

1007
01:08:38,122 --> 01:08:39,316
Okay.

1008
01:08:39,523 --> 01:08:40,547
Damn it!

1009
01:08:43,661 --> 01:08:45,151
Wait, wait.

1010
01:08:46,930 --> 01:08:48,659
Wait, Sandy!

1011
01:09:01,845 --> 01:09:03,540
Oh, my God!

1012
01:09:03,747 --> 01:09:05,806
Darren. What happened to you?

1013
01:09:06,016 --> 01:09:08,507
-I ran here from the club.
-That's 30 miles!

1014
01:09:08,719 --> 01:09:11,449
Yeah, I know. I wanted to say...

1015
01:09:12,022 --> 01:09:15,150
...I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Can you ever forgive me?

1016
01:09:16,026 --> 01:09:18,995
Because the whole Judith thing
and the nipple clamps...

1017
01:09:19,196 --> 01:09:20,322
-...it's crazy, and--
-Yes!

1018
01:09:21,899 --> 01:09:23,161
-Really?
-Yes.

1019
01:09:23,534 --> 01:09:24,694
Just like that?

1020
01:09:24,902 --> 01:09:27,700
Well, I am training
to become a nun, you know.

1021
01:09:27,905 --> 01:09:29,930
Forgiveness is just sort of my thing.

1022
01:09:30,207 --> 01:09:31,333
I love you.

1023
01:09:31,542 --> 01:09:32,566
-Really?
-I love you.

1024
01:09:32,776 --> 01:09:35,301
-I love you.
-Oh, love. Love.

1025
01:09:53,130 --> 01:09:55,724
-Happy?
-You didn't have to do that.

1026
01:09:55,933 --> 01:10:00,393
I just happened to be by Arby's.
They were throwing out old food...

1027
01:10:00,604 --> 01:10:03,095
...so, you know, I thought, "Why not?"

1028
01:10:03,307 --> 01:10:06,174
Either way, that's nice of you.

1029
01:10:13,417 --> 01:10:15,044
I was wondering:

1030
01:10:16,587 --> 01:10:18,919
-Why Darren?
-What do you mean?

1031
01:10:19,356 --> 01:10:22,814
You don't seem the type to go
for a sensitive guy like Darren.

1032
01:10:23,026 --> 01:10:27,656
You seem more the kind of woman
that needs an assertive type of guy.

1033
01:10:33,871 --> 01:10:36,203
Before I met Darren, I was--

1034
01:10:38,776 --> 01:10:40,869
I was engaged to a guy like that.

1035
01:10:41,578 --> 01:10:45,708
His idea of fun was to fly to Thailand
to fight in a kickboxing tournament.

1036
01:10:46,450 --> 01:10:47,849
U.S.A.! Go, Josh!

1037
01:11:11,408 --> 01:11:13,808
After that,
I decided no more tough guys.

1038
01:11:14,711 --> 01:11:16,679
Yeah, and then you found Darren.

1039
01:11:16,880 --> 01:11:17,938
Yeah.

1040
01:11:18,382 --> 01:11:21,977
-So do you even love him?
-There's different types of love.

1041
01:11:22,886 --> 01:11:24,410
I knew it!

1042
01:11:24,621 --> 01:11:28,682
Sometimes you make rational decisions.
You can't always follow your heart.

1043
01:11:29,026 --> 01:11:30,152
Yeah, whatever.

1044
01:11:30,527 --> 01:11:34,258
I will admit there's something sexy
about a man who takes charge.

1045
01:11:34,765 --> 01:11:36,733
Like you kidnapping me.

1046
01:11:37,868 --> 01:11:39,631
That took balls.

1047
01:11:40,237 --> 01:11:41,795
Big balls.

1048
01:11:42,973 --> 01:11:44,941
I gotta say it turned me on.

1049
01:11:46,610 --> 01:11:47,941
It did?

1050
01:12:27,417 --> 01:12:28,816
Oh, my God.

1051
01:12:34,524 --> 01:12:36,492
Goddamn these chains!

1052
01:12:41,198 --> 01:12:42,529
Little key, little key.

1053
01:12:43,267 --> 01:12:45,394
What am I doing? I can't let you go!

1054
01:12:45,769 --> 01:12:48,329
Just give me one free hand.
It'll be worth it.

1055
01:12:49,873 --> 01:12:52,137
Okay. Give me the fries.

1056
01:13:01,618 --> 01:13:03,279
-Hi.
-Wow.

1057
01:13:03,487 --> 01:13:04,681
Hey.

1058
01:13:05,222 --> 01:13:06,519
Shit.

1059
01:13:09,493 --> 01:13:11,620
Just wait one minute, okay?

1060
01:13:15,933 --> 01:13:17,764
-Dude--
-Dude, you got a boner?

1061
01:13:18,068 --> 01:13:19,057
No.

1062
01:13:19,269 --> 01:13:21,328
-Why didn't you answer the door?
-I'm eating.

1063
01:13:21,538 --> 01:13:23,005
-So?
-I don't answer when I'm eating.

1064
01:13:23,206 --> 01:13:24,503
-Since when?
-Since always.

1065
01:13:24,708 --> 01:13:27,700
-I never knew that.
-You didn't know a lot, like I'm gay.

1066
01:13:28,045 --> 01:13:31,344
-Anything else you want to tell me?
-I got three balls.

1067
01:13:31,548 --> 01:13:34,381
Shut up! God!

1068
01:13:35,953 --> 01:13:36,977
Dude.

1069
01:13:38,221 --> 01:13:39,245
Hi, coach.

1070
01:13:39,456 --> 01:13:40,923
What are you doing here?

1071
01:13:41,124 --> 01:13:43,558
Retrial. Got a judge
that's a sports fan.

1072
01:13:44,027 --> 01:13:46,018
-Congrats.
-What will you do now?

1073
01:13:46,229 --> 01:13:50,290
That's why I'm here. Need a place
to crash, figure out my next move.

1074
01:13:50,500 --> 01:13:52,161
I knew I could count on you.

1075
01:13:52,369 --> 01:13:55,566
-Well, we gotta talk about--
-You stay as long as you like.

1076
01:13:55,839 --> 01:13:58,706
Great! Where's the bathroom?
I gotta take a dump.

1077
01:13:58,909 --> 01:14:02,970
We don't use the toilet anymore since
we're cutting down on the water bill.

1078
01:14:03,180 --> 01:14:04,306
What do you do?

1079
01:14:04,514 --> 01:14:07,142
Well, we just use the lawn now.

1080
01:14:07,551 --> 01:14:09,246
Smart thinking.

1081
01:14:09,619 --> 01:14:10,608
Oh, God!

1082
01:14:10,988 --> 01:14:13,980
You pinch loaves on the lawn?
I play croquet out there.

1083
01:14:14,191 --> 01:14:16,523
Are you crazy? Coach can't stay here!

1084
01:14:16,727 --> 01:14:19,821
-We got a woman locked in the garage!
-Oh, yeah!

1085
01:14:24,768 --> 01:14:26,463
You boys got any T.P.?

1086
01:14:26,670 --> 01:14:28,001
No!

1087
01:14:28,305 --> 01:14:30,330
That's all right.
I'll find something.

1088
01:14:36,179 --> 01:14:39,114
Play it cool. We'll find
some way to get rid of him.

1089
01:14:39,349 --> 01:14:43,410
We tell him we got dates. He can't
be here because we're getting laid.

1090
01:14:43,620 --> 01:14:45,747
No, he'll never believe that.

1091
01:14:45,956 --> 01:14:47,787
We'll tell him we got ghosts.

1092
01:14:48,025 --> 01:14:50,152
So, boys, what's for supper?

1093
01:14:50,360 --> 01:14:52,851
-Listen, coach--
-We have ghosts.

1094
01:14:53,196 --> 01:14:57,189
We were thinking that maybe you
staying here's not such a great idea.

1095
01:14:57,401 --> 01:15:01,462
Nonsense. It'll give us a chance
to get to know one another again.

1096
01:15:01,705 --> 01:15:06,335
So you boys take care of that bitch
that was gonna marry Silverman?

1097
01:15:06,543 --> 01:15:10,206
Yeah, we snuffed that bitch
just like you said.

1098
01:15:10,714 --> 01:15:12,614
Good. How'd you do it?

1099
01:15:13,483 --> 01:15:14,507
-We--
-Ate her.

1100
01:15:15,118 --> 01:15:16,107
You ate her?

1101
01:15:16,386 --> 01:15:19,253
-Yeah. We ate her.
-Alive.

1102
01:15:19,456 --> 01:15:20,787
My hat goes off to you.

1103
01:15:20,991 --> 01:15:23,892
You boys are smart.
That's the perfect crime.

1104
01:15:24,961 --> 01:15:27,088
Wonder what's on the tube.

1105
01:15:27,397 --> 01:15:28,625
-No! Coach!
-No!

1106
01:15:29,900 --> 01:15:33,461
What the hell we got here?
Some kind of public access show?

1107
01:15:34,471 --> 01:15:36,598
That's the kidnap victim, ain't it?

1108
01:15:36,807 --> 01:15:37,967
You didn't kill her!

1109
01:15:38,175 --> 01:15:39,836
No. Coach, listen....

1110
01:15:40,043 --> 01:15:43,069
I am really disappointed in you boys.

1111
01:15:43,280 --> 01:15:45,908
I want you to go out there
and off that cooze.

1112
01:15:46,116 --> 01:15:47,481
We can't, coach.

1113
01:15:47,684 --> 01:15:50,312
Oh, for Pete's sakes!
Look! She's getting out!

1114
01:15:50,854 --> 01:15:53,288
Go chop her head off or something.

1115
01:15:54,324 --> 01:15:58,852
There's no fight left in you boys.
You're nutless. You been pussified.

1116
01:15:59,329 --> 01:16:02,992
Don't worry about a thing, boys.
I'll take care of that broad.

1117
01:16:09,506 --> 01:16:11,133
-Don't worry!
-Who are you?

1118
01:16:11,408 --> 01:16:14,809
Let's say I'm a friend of the boys,
and I'm here to kill you.

1119
01:16:15,078 --> 01:16:17,808
You don't mind if I try
to defend myself, do you?

1120
01:16:18,014 --> 01:16:20,915
Of course not.
I love a good challenge.

1121
01:16:41,538 --> 01:16:42,869
Are you okay?

1122
01:16:49,679 --> 01:16:50,703
Dude--

1123
01:16:58,488 --> 01:16:59,477
Got it?

1124
01:17:03,627 --> 01:17:06,391
-I'm so happy.
-Oh, me too.

1125
01:17:09,332 --> 01:17:11,129
Does this couch fold out?

1126
01:17:22,345 --> 01:17:24,643
What the hell is going on here?

1127
01:17:26,183 --> 01:17:27,241
-Judith!
-Yes.

1128
01:17:27,450 --> 01:17:28,917
-You're alive.
-Yes.

1129
01:17:29,119 --> 01:17:31,610
-Judith?
-Who is this tramp?

1130
01:17:31,821 --> 01:17:33,118
I'm not a tramp.

1131
01:17:33,323 --> 01:17:36,656
Actually, until yesterday,
I was training to become a nun.

1132
01:17:37,060 --> 01:17:39,756
I'm gone for a week,
and you're screwing a nun?

1133
01:17:39,963 --> 01:17:42,625
No, no. We're in love.

1134
01:17:43,166 --> 01:17:44,497
I thought you were dead.

1135
01:17:44,868 --> 01:17:48,167
Oh, really? Well, I'm not dead.
I was kidnapped, okay?

1136
01:17:48,371 --> 01:17:50,362
It was hell!
I was beaten, tortured...

1137
01:17:50,574 --> 01:17:53,600
...and treated like
a frigging farm animal!

1138
01:17:53,843 --> 01:17:55,105
And the entire time...

1139
01:17:55,312 --> 01:17:58,338
...the only thing that kept
me alive was the thought...

1140
01:17:58,848 --> 01:18:02,511
...that somewhere out there,
my sweet Darren still loved me...

1141
01:18:02,719 --> 01:18:05,187
...and that one day
we'd be together again.

1142
01:18:07,791 --> 01:18:09,088
It was so horrible.

1143
01:18:17,601 --> 01:18:21,697
-Where are we going?
-I don't know. We gotta find her.

1144
01:18:22,372 --> 01:18:24,237
-Okay, where to?
-Go left!

1145
01:18:24,441 --> 01:18:26,033
I'm going right!

1146
01:18:26,676 --> 01:18:29,008
They kept me in
a dark closet for days.

1147
01:18:29,212 --> 01:18:34,115
And they fed me, like,
crushed potato chips under the door.

1148
01:18:37,087 --> 01:18:40,488
Maybe I should go.

1149
01:18:40,724 --> 01:18:42,089
Oh, no.

1150
01:18:44,728 --> 01:18:46,628
Please. Please, don't.

1151
01:18:46,830 --> 01:18:48,798
Don't leave.

1152
01:18:48,999 --> 01:18:50,296
Well, but, I mean...

1153
01:18:50,500 --> 01:18:54,732
...Judith's alive,
and she is your fiancée.

1154
01:18:56,306 --> 01:18:59,673
I know. You're right.
You're right. But....

1155
01:19:00,076 --> 01:19:02,135
But you can't go because I....

1156
01:19:02,612 --> 01:19:05,479
-Because what? Why, Darren?
-Because I--

1157
01:19:06,016 --> 01:19:07,608
-See, you--
-Yeah?

1158
01:19:07,817 --> 01:19:09,250
-Well, we-- And--
-Yeah?

1159
01:19:09,452 --> 01:19:12,353
Sweetheart, we pledged
our love to one another.

1160
01:19:12,589 --> 01:19:15,217
Spare her the pain
of seeing us together.

1161
01:19:15,425 --> 01:19:16,585
You...

1162
01:19:16,826 --> 01:19:18,919
...run along back to the nunnery.

1163
01:19:24,267 --> 01:19:25,256
She's right.

1164
01:19:25,669 --> 01:19:27,000
I mean...

1165
01:19:27,337 --> 01:19:29,532
...I did pledge.

1166
01:19:31,708 --> 01:19:33,073
Okay.

1167
01:19:36,146 --> 01:19:37,204
Bye.

1168
01:19:40,150 --> 01:19:41,515
She's here! Hey, Darren.

1169
01:19:41,718 --> 01:19:44,949
Sandy, hi. Look, I can--
Darren. Sorry.

1170
01:19:45,155 --> 01:19:48,682
Darren, look. I understand
that you're really upset.

1171
01:19:48,892 --> 01:19:51,417
I probably look like
a really big asshole--

1172
01:19:51,628 --> 01:19:52,959
Dude!

1173
01:19:54,464 --> 01:19:58,901
Okay. I deserved that.
But now let me explain--

1174
01:20:03,973 --> 01:20:08,376
Okay, I guess I deserved that one too,
but now we're even, okay?

1175
01:20:12,949 --> 01:20:16,783
Stop! We only did it
because we love you.

1176
01:20:16,986 --> 01:20:18,851
Oh, right, because you love me.

1177
01:20:19,055 --> 01:20:22,149
Yeah, man. Come on.
Give me a hug. It's--

1178
01:20:35,538 --> 01:20:39,668
-Freeze!
-Get your hands up!

1179
01:20:49,486 --> 01:20:52,387
Don't think my presence here
means I forgive you.

1180
01:20:52,589 --> 01:20:55,422
I just wanted to tell
you guys in person.

1181
01:20:55,625 --> 01:20:58,116
Judith and I are
getting married tomorrow.

1182
01:20:58,328 --> 01:21:00,956
You don't want to marry Judith.
Admit it.

1183
01:21:01,297 --> 01:21:03,959
-Of course I do.
-Okay.

1184
01:21:04,434 --> 01:21:06,698
Then look into my eyes and say it.

1185
01:21:07,137 --> 01:21:09,105
I want to marry Judith.

1186
01:21:09,439 --> 01:21:12,966
Look into both our eyes
at the same time and say it.

1187
01:21:13,543 --> 01:21:15,067
I'm out of here.

1188
01:21:16,479 --> 01:21:19,812
Come on. We're sorry, okay?

1189
01:21:20,150 --> 01:21:22,050
What we did was wrong.

1190
01:21:25,722 --> 01:21:27,246
We gotta stop that wedding.

1191
01:21:27,457 --> 01:21:29,254
Dude, how?

1192
01:21:30,527 --> 01:21:35,123
Let's go, you maggots!
Kill! Kill! Kill!

1193
01:21:37,634 --> 01:21:41,126
Coach. Yeah, it's Wayne and J.D.
Look, we need your help.

1194
01:21:41,337 --> 01:21:44,534
I'd do anything for you boys.
Name it, you got it.

1195
01:21:44,741 --> 01:21:49,337
Well, we need you to post bail for us.
It's $10,000 apiece.

1196
01:21:49,579 --> 01:21:52,571
-No way!
-Come on, coach.

1197
01:21:52,782 --> 01:21:54,079
We need your help.

1198
01:21:54,317 --> 01:21:56,842
Jail life is real tough. They're--

1199
01:21:57,120 --> 01:21:59,645
They're sodomizing us in here.

1200
01:21:59,856 --> 01:22:02,188
What?! They're corn-holing you?

1201
01:22:02,392 --> 01:22:06,522
Oh, my God. That's horrible.
Don't worry. I'll get you out.

1202
01:22:07,697 --> 01:22:11,497
You got sodomized?
Who? I want to meet him.

1203
01:22:13,937 --> 01:22:14,904
What is that?

1204
01:22:15,104 --> 01:22:17,095
Sounds kind of like my truck.

1205
01:22:23,913 --> 01:22:25,278
Come on, boys. Let's go.

1206
01:22:26,583 --> 01:22:28,574
Get the lead out, boys! Hut, hut!

1207
01:22:29,519 --> 01:22:31,077
Come on, move it!

1208
01:22:31,855 --> 01:22:35,086
You're free. Now, where to, boys?

1209
01:22:35,358 --> 01:22:36,620
Go left.

1210
01:22:38,795 --> 01:22:40,092
Charge!

1211
01:22:42,732 --> 01:22:44,700
Sandy Perkus...

1212
01:22:45,034 --> 01:22:47,764
...do you vow to lead
a life of poverty...

1213
01:22:47,971 --> 01:22:49,871
...chastity, obedience...

1214
01:22:50,073 --> 01:22:51,768
...and silence?

1215
01:22:52,408 --> 01:22:53,875
Wait!

1216
01:22:55,044 --> 01:22:56,033
Sorry.

1217
01:22:57,881 --> 01:22:59,371
Look, you can't do this.

1218
01:22:59,616 --> 01:23:01,982
-You love Darren, right?
-Well, yeah.

1219
01:23:02,218 --> 01:23:04,379
-Well, Darren loves you.
-Really?

1220
01:23:04,621 --> 01:23:07,681
Darren's her boyfriend,
but he has this other girlfriend...

1221
01:23:07,891 --> 01:23:10,883
-...and he's getting--
-So, what are you gonna do?

1222
01:23:12,729 --> 01:23:14,492
Go, my child.

1223
01:23:15,064 --> 01:23:16,156
-Okay.
-Come on.

1224
01:23:16,399 --> 01:23:18,424
We've got a wedding to crash!

1225
01:23:18,635 --> 01:23:20,500
Go. Go. Go.

1226
01:23:20,737 --> 01:23:21,726
Bye, everybody!

1227
01:23:22,906 --> 01:23:25,101
Damn. Lost another one.

1228
01:23:25,308 --> 01:23:27,242
Son of a bitch.

1229
01:23:41,958 --> 01:23:43,983
I can't believe I'm doing this.

1230
01:23:44,193 --> 01:23:46,855
Oh, here. We got you some clothes.

1231
01:23:48,431 --> 01:23:50,399
Where did you get these?

1232
01:23:50,600 --> 01:23:51,624
J.D.'s sister.

1233
01:23:51,834 --> 01:23:54,428
-She's a stripper.
-And a hooker.

1234
01:24:12,055 --> 01:24:13,215
Go! Gotta go!

1235
01:24:18,227 --> 01:24:19,353
Oh, my gosh!

1236
01:24:19,562 --> 01:24:21,052
Neil Diamond!

1237
01:24:21,297 --> 01:24:22,764
What the hell is going on?

1238
01:24:22,966 --> 01:24:24,228
Neil, let me explain.

1239
01:24:24,434 --> 01:24:28,598
You're the guys who send me all those
letters and tapes. Naked pictures.

1240
01:24:28,805 --> 01:24:32,332
What? We never sent you
any naked pictures.

1241
01:24:32,709 --> 01:24:33,937
-Dude.
-Sorry.

1242
01:24:34,143 --> 01:24:36,941
Mr. Diamond, you gotta
help us save our buddy.

1243
01:24:37,146 --> 01:24:38,773
He's marrying the wrong woman.

1244
01:24:38,982 --> 01:24:41,177
Sandy and Darren, they broke up.

1245
01:24:41,384 --> 01:24:43,648
Love on the rocks.
Ain't no big surprise.

1246
01:24:43,853 --> 01:24:47,254
-Help us get them back together.
-I don't know.

1247
01:24:47,457 --> 01:24:50,324
Turn on your heart light.
Judith brainwashed him.

1248
01:24:50,526 --> 01:24:53,256
For years, Darren loved me,
but I never knew it.

1249
01:24:53,463 --> 01:24:54,896
Hold it. Hold it!

1250
01:24:55,732 --> 01:24:58,223
-Hold on.
-And did I mention I was gay?

1251
01:24:58,434 --> 01:25:01,699
I've spent my life writing songs
about the power of love...

1252
01:25:01,904 --> 01:25:04,771
...but up until right now,
they've only been words.

1253
01:25:05,008 --> 01:25:08,944
This may be my chance to prove that
those words really mean something.

1254
01:25:09,145 --> 01:25:12,239
-You say that if Darren marries...
-Judith.

1255
01:25:12,448 --> 01:25:14,939
-...Judith, he'll be miserable.
-Right.

1256
01:25:15,151 --> 01:25:19,144
I believe in happy endings. If Neil
Diamond has anything to do with it...

1257
01:25:19,355 --> 01:25:21,152
...this love story will have one.

1258
01:25:21,357 --> 01:25:23,416
Come on! Yeah!

1259
01:25:23,793 --> 01:25:26,660
We got Neil Diamond onboard!
All right!

1260
01:25:26,863 --> 01:25:29,593
-Where we going?
-The park on America Avenue.

1261
01:25:30,633 --> 01:25:32,430
-5-0!
-What?

1262
01:25:32,635 --> 01:25:33,795
Cops. Caprice.

1263
01:25:34,037 --> 01:25:36,267
Five cars back. Goddamn heat.

1264
01:25:36,472 --> 01:25:39,373
One little prison break,
and they're all over you.

1265
01:25:40,376 --> 01:25:41,604
Whoa, coach.

1266
01:25:42,211 --> 01:25:44,441
No matter what happens,
don't look back.

1267
01:25:44,647 --> 01:25:47,548
Just get this sweet gal
to the man who loves her.

1268
01:25:47,750 --> 01:25:51,709
I'd rather be cut down in a hail
of gunfire than to go back to jail.

1269
01:25:52,155 --> 01:25:54,282
Nice meeting you, Mr. Diamond.

1270
01:26:02,732 --> 01:26:03,892
Coach, look out!

1271
01:26:07,136 --> 01:26:08,262
They're not cops!

1272
01:26:13,743 --> 01:26:16,143
Hey, we're coming to America.

1273
01:26:21,284 --> 01:26:25,482
Dearly beloved, we are gathered here
today to join Darren Silverman...

1274
01:26:25,688 --> 01:26:29,021
...and Judith Fessbeggler
in holy matrimony.

1275
01:26:29,325 --> 01:26:32,260
If anyone has any objections,
speak now.

1276
01:26:32,528 --> 01:26:33,586
I do.

1277
01:26:33,796 --> 01:26:35,821
-What?
-Neil?

1278
01:26:41,437 --> 01:26:42,768
-Neil!
-Neil.

1279
01:26:42,972 --> 01:26:45,372
Get to the part where we say, "I do."

1280
01:27:08,397 --> 01:27:09,386
Oh, my!

1281
01:27:10,199 --> 01:27:12,030
-Say, "I do."
-No.

1282
01:27:12,468 --> 01:27:14,129
Say, "I do."

1283
01:27:14,370 --> 01:27:16,201
I can't. Because I...

1284
01:27:19,542 --> 01:27:21,533
...I love Neil...

1285
01:27:21,744 --> 01:27:23,541
...and I love Sandy.

1286
01:27:25,148 --> 01:27:26,809
You're in love with this slut?

1287
01:27:27,016 --> 01:27:29,143
I am not a slut.

1288
01:27:29,652 --> 01:27:31,984
Sandy is my one and only someone.

1289
01:27:45,568 --> 01:27:47,058
What about me?

1290
01:27:47,603 --> 01:27:50,163
Who's my someone?

1291
01:28:07,890 --> 01:28:09,755
You ruined my life!

1292
01:28:11,127 --> 01:28:12,560
But I saved Darren's!

1293
01:28:12,762 --> 01:28:15,959
Just because I lost Darren
doesn't mean I'm crazy enough...

1294
01:28:16,232 --> 01:28:17,631
...to hook up with you!

1295
01:28:23,406 --> 01:28:26,842
Why can't you just admit that
when you kissed me, you liked it?

1296
01:28:27,043 --> 01:28:30,137
You're right. I have a weakness
for incompetent morons.

1297
01:28:39,222 --> 01:28:40,780
Admit it!

1298
01:28:42,091 --> 01:28:45,390
I'm the strong-willed,
assertive man that you need...

1299
01:28:45,595 --> 01:28:49,554
...and you're the hard-core bitch
that I've always dreamed of.

1300
01:29:09,919 --> 01:29:10,908
What about you?

1301
01:29:11,754 --> 01:29:15,246
-When are you gonna get hitched?
-Actually, I'm not. I'm gay.

1302
01:29:16,425 --> 01:29:17,687
Me too.

1303
01:29:17,927 --> 01:29:19,155
Really?

1304
01:29:19,896 --> 01:29:22,694
By the power vested in me
by the state of Washington...

1305
01:29:22,899 --> 01:29:25,561
...I now pronounce you man and wife.

1306
01:29:25,768 --> 01:29:27,429
You may kiss the bride.

1307
01:29:30,273 --> 01:29:32,901
I now pronounce you man and wife.

1308
01:29:33,109 --> 01:29:35,043
You may kiss the bride.

1309
01:29:37,747 --> 01:29:41,239
I now pronounce you man and man.

1310
01:29:41,450 --> 01:29:43,384
You may kiss the man.

1311
01:30:05,474 --> 01:30:07,465
Come on, we need you for this one.

1312
00:01:03,204 --> 00:01:07,106
Neil Diamond. Hot August night, 1972.

1313
00:01:07,308 --> 00:01:12,211
That concert rocked and rolled.
I know because I was there.

1314
00:01:17,719 --> 00:01:19,084
That's me.

1315
00:01:22,557 --> 00:01:23,717
My water broke.

1316
00:01:23,925 --> 00:01:27,986
Eversince then, I've had this
cosmic connection with Neil.

1317
00:01:28,229 --> 00:01:30,026
But this story isn't about Neil.

1318
00:01:30,231 --> 00:01:33,723
It's about me and my two pals,
Darren and J.D.

1319
00:01:34,235 --> 00:01:36,897
Best friends since fifth grade.

1320
00:01:39,073 --> 00:01:42,770
That's J.D. He's lactose intolerant.

1321
00:01:45,079 --> 00:01:46,910
And he's not very bright.

1322
00:01:47,615 --> 00:01:49,640
That's Darren Silverman.

1323
00:01:49,851 --> 00:01:51,409
He's a romantic.

1324
00:01:51,619 --> 00:01:55,020
But when it comes to women,
he's incredibly gullible.

1325
00:02:01,929 --> 00:02:04,090
That's me, Wayne.

1326
00:02:04,565 --> 00:02:06,260
I'm loyal to my friends.

1327
00:02:06,467 --> 00:02:09,925
-I'd beat you up if you weren't a girl.
-Me too.

1328
00:02:19,313 --> 00:02:21,304
After that, I started working out.

1329
00:02:22,216 --> 00:02:25,014
We stayed best friends
throughout high school.

1330
00:02:25,219 --> 00:02:27,779
I was the third-string quarterback.

1331
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:31,790
J.D. became the school mascot.

1332
00:02:32,627 --> 00:02:36,119
Hey, what did you say
I didn't really motherfucking hearyou

1333
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:39,060
Yeah, yeah you
Yeah you, yeah you, yeah you

1334
00:02:40,468 --> 00:02:43,335
And Darrenjoined
the cheerleading squad.

1335
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:48,808
Oh, that's Sandy.

1336
00:02:49,077 --> 00:02:51,807
Yeah, Darren's always
had a thing for her.

1337
00:02:52,814 --> 00:02:54,839
When you're up against a Warbird

1338
00:02:55,049 --> 00:02:56,277
You're upside down!

1339
00:02:57,852 --> 00:02:59,444
Oh, that's Coach Norton.

1340
00:02:59,654 --> 00:03:03,090
He was a big influence in ourlives.
He taught us many things.

1341
00:03:03,291 --> 00:03:05,657
Two things you got to remember, boys.

1342
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:09,591
Number one: Stay away from women.

1343
00:03:09,797 --> 00:03:12,664
All they want from you
is your man juice.

1344
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,024
Now...

1345
00:03:14,235 --> 00:03:19,400
...if you get any urges that you can't
suppress with hard liquor, use this.

1346
00:03:21,209 --> 00:03:23,837
-Oh, number two....
-Sportsmanship.

1347
00:03:24,045 --> 00:03:25,376
Sportsmanship.

1348
00:03:25,713 --> 00:03:27,476
Sportsmanship.

1349
00:03:30,451 --> 00:03:32,544
You fairy wimp fruit bag!

1350
00:03:32,754 --> 00:03:34,244
You suck!

1351
00:03:37,158 --> 00:03:39,888
Le Fessier! Get out there!

1352
00:03:40,495 --> 00:03:42,725
I'm just gonna get my helmet.

1353
00:03:42,997 --> 00:03:45,488
Hey, guys! Guys, I'm in!

1354
00:03:46,434 --> 00:03:48,595
-See, he's going in!
-Oh, my God!

1355
00:03:50,605 --> 00:03:52,664
Go, Wayne! Go, Wayne!

1356
00:03:52,874 --> 00:03:56,002
Blue 48! Blue 48!

1357
00:03:56,210 --> 00:03:57,734
Go! Set!

1358
00:03:57,945 --> 00:03:59,003
Hike!

1359
00:04:07,455 --> 00:04:10,015
But now we're all grown-up.

1360
00:04:18,299 --> 00:04:22,292
J.D. is rapidly working his way
up the ladder at Subway.

1361
00:04:22,670 --> 00:04:24,968
Recently he was promoted...

1362
00:04:25,173 --> 00:04:29,041
...to temporary second assistant manager
in charge of training.

1363
00:04:29,243 --> 00:04:31,837
Okay, McNugent,
let's see what you got.

1364
00:04:32,046 --> 00:04:37,177
I've been working on them for 8 weeks.
I present the future of Subway.

1365
00:04:37,385 --> 00:04:38,647
Bellston...

1366
00:04:39,053 --> 00:04:41,886
...three sizes of bevy are small,
medium and what?

1367
00:04:43,357 --> 00:04:46,554
-Big?
-Like we practiced. You can do this.

1368
00:04:46,761 --> 00:04:48,058
L....

1369
00:04:53,634 --> 00:04:55,124
Long!

1370
00:04:55,336 --> 00:04:57,327
Okay, we'll come back to you.

1371
00:04:57,538 --> 00:05:00,268
This guy's my stinkiest student
by far.

1372
00:05:00,474 --> 00:05:02,271
Trimball, let's see your sub.

1373
00:05:04,111 --> 00:05:06,705
No, no. Meat on the inside,
bread outside.

1374
00:05:08,249 --> 00:05:10,080
Okay, take it away.

1375
00:05:10,284 --> 00:05:12,047
Take it away!

1376
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:16,287
Don't judge me on those two guys.
This next guy's my protégé.

1377
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:20,392
He's top of his class, and for his
thesis he made a party sub.

1378
00:05:21,329 --> 00:05:23,490
Heston, where's the party sub?

1379
00:05:35,476 --> 00:05:38,536
Darren is a social director
at a retirement home.

1380
00:05:38,746 --> 00:05:39,735
B-17.

1381
00:05:40,248 --> 00:05:41,510
Bingo.

1382
00:05:42,083 --> 00:05:43,414
Bingo.

1383
00:05:44,018 --> 00:05:45,178
Abe...

1384
00:05:45,419 --> 00:05:48,616
...pull your pants up
or no more Matlock.

1385
00:05:53,294 --> 00:05:54,727
I started my own business.

1386
00:05:57,832 --> 00:05:59,561
What are we dealing with here?

1387
00:06:00,201 --> 00:06:02,465
I don't know, but it sounds big.

1388
00:06:04,171 --> 00:06:05,934
Stay back. I'm going in.

1389
00:06:12,213 --> 00:06:13,202
Careful, sonny.

1390
00:06:19,453 --> 00:06:21,751
So you're causing
all this trouble, huh?

1391
00:06:21,956 --> 00:06:22,945
Come here.

1392
00:06:23,157 --> 00:06:25,785
Hey there. Hello.

1393
00:06:29,130 --> 00:06:31,690
Here's the ferocious beast, huh?

1394
00:06:33,801 --> 00:06:35,291
Hey, where's your mommy?

1395
00:06:38,272 --> 00:06:39,637
Get off! Get it off!

1396
00:06:52,987 --> 00:06:54,545
Is it dead?

1397
00:06:54,755 --> 00:06:55,881
No.

1398
00:06:56,090 --> 00:06:58,888
But she is in one deep coon coma.

1399
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:14,373
Stop it!

1400
00:07:15,643 --> 00:07:19,477
But we all have one mystical thing
in common: Ourlove forNeil.

1401
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,444
That's ourband,
Diamonds in the Rough.

1402
00:08:18,172 --> 00:08:19,662
Hey, I'm Darren.

1403
00:08:19,907 --> 00:08:20,896
Sophie.

1404
00:08:21,108 --> 00:08:23,702
Do you, maybe, want to grab
a drink with me?

1405
00:08:23,911 --> 00:08:26,209
I'm sorry. I'm involved.

1406
00:08:26,414 --> 00:08:28,143
With a real entertainer.

1407
00:08:37,591 --> 00:08:41,687
I can't believe I got blown off again.
I'll never meet the right girl.

1408
00:08:41,929 --> 00:08:44,420
You don't want
a chick who'd fuck a mime.

1409
00:08:44,632 --> 00:08:48,090
Dude, what does a mime look like
when it's having sex anyway?

1410
00:08:48,302 --> 00:08:49,769
It's probably like:

1411
00:08:51,105 --> 00:08:54,506
"l'm a mime. I'm a mime."

1412
00:08:54,708 --> 00:08:56,676
Hey, mimes don't talk.

1413
00:08:58,779 --> 00:09:01,771
They do when they're off duty.

1414
00:09:03,017 --> 00:09:06,111
It's not her. It's all women.

1415
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:10,120
I'm really afraid that
there's nobody out there for me.

1416
00:09:10,324 --> 00:09:12,189
The only girl I ever loved...

1417
00:09:12,393 --> 00:09:14,827
...walked out of my life years ago.

1418
00:09:15,296 --> 00:09:16,456
Sandy Perkus.

1419
00:09:16,664 --> 00:09:18,131
-Rememberher?
-Smile.

1420
00:09:18,332 --> 00:09:20,197
Her family was with the circus.

1421
00:09:20,468 --> 00:09:22,026
Her dad was The Strong Man.

1422
00:09:22,236 --> 00:09:24,033
Hermom was The Bearded Lady.

1423
00:09:24,238 --> 00:09:26,297
Herbrother was The Dog-faced Boy.

1424
00:09:27,675 --> 00:09:31,475
Before I mustered the courage
to ask her out, she moved away.

1425
00:09:33,247 --> 00:09:34,976
You know, I truly believe...

1426
00:09:35,182 --> 00:09:39,642
...that there is a one and only
someone for everyone.

1427
00:09:39,987 --> 00:09:41,352
And Sandy...

1428
00:09:41,755 --> 00:09:43,484
...Sandy Perkus...

1429
00:09:45,159 --> 00:09:47,059
...was my one and only.

1430
00:09:47,361 --> 00:09:50,353
Man, that is so romantic.

1431
00:09:50,631 --> 00:09:52,861
Oh, my God!
Look at that juicy piece of ass.

1432
00:09:56,871 --> 00:09:58,429
What do you think of her?

1433
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:00,131
-Who?
-Right there.

1434
00:10:00,374 --> 00:10:01,705
In the red?

1435
00:10:03,310 --> 00:10:05,403
-Yeah, she's gorgeous.
-Go talk to her.

1436
00:10:05,613 --> 00:10:07,342
-No.
-Okay, I'll do it for you.

1437
00:10:07,548 --> 00:10:09,038
What? Hey, wait.

1438
00:10:11,385 --> 00:10:12,716
Hi. I'm Wayne.

1439
00:10:13,053 --> 00:10:15,044
-No.
-No, you don't understand.

1440
00:10:15,489 --> 00:10:16,820
I'm not hitting on you.

1441
00:10:17,057 --> 00:10:18,046
Back off.

1442
00:10:18,259 --> 00:10:21,251
I just want to tell you
about my buddy, Darren.

1443
00:10:21,462 --> 00:10:23,191
He's smart, he's sensitive--

1444
00:10:23,397 --> 00:10:25,524
-I don't care.
-He'd make a great husband.

1445
00:10:25,733 --> 00:10:27,758
-I don't want to meet him.
-Great.

1446
00:10:31,071 --> 00:10:34,336
Dude, she wants you.
She thinks you're really cute.

1447
00:10:34,575 --> 00:10:36,133
-Really?
-Yeah, she's like:

1448
00:10:36,343 --> 00:10:39,005
"Oh, I'm so excited to meet him,"
and everything.

1449
00:10:39,246 --> 00:10:40,713
-Are you sure?
-Totally!

1450
00:10:40,915 --> 00:10:42,906
Get down there and make your move.

1451
00:10:44,418 --> 00:10:45,544
I don't know.

1452
00:10:45,753 --> 00:10:46,742
Come on!

1453
00:10:46,954 --> 00:10:49,286
-Carpe poon!
-Really?

1454
00:10:51,926 --> 00:10:54,793
-Okay, I'll do it.
-All right!

1455
00:11:03,137 --> 00:11:04,229
I'm Darren.

1456
00:11:05,673 --> 00:11:10,610
Darren. My friend said
you wanted to meet me.

1457
00:11:10,811 --> 00:11:11,971
He lied.

1458
00:11:12,713 --> 00:11:14,544
That's a good one.

1459
00:11:15,349 --> 00:11:17,817
No, seriously.
I don't want to meet you.

1460
00:11:25,226 --> 00:11:28,218
My friend must have been mistaken.

1461
00:11:30,164 --> 00:11:32,564
I'm really sorry to bother you.

1462
00:11:37,438 --> 00:11:38,871
Let me guess.

1463
00:11:39,607 --> 00:11:43,043
That jerk tried to get into your pants
with some tacky line.

1464
00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:44,772
I'm not like that.

1465
00:11:45,012 --> 00:11:46,445
I use magic.

1466
00:11:47,214 --> 00:11:48,340
Beat it, baldy.

1467
00:11:48,549 --> 00:11:51,313
Okay, good stuff.
Tough crowd. I like that.

1468
00:11:51,518 --> 00:11:53,509
I have here two...

1469
00:11:53,721 --> 00:11:55,916
...ordinary metal rings.

1470
00:11:56,123 --> 00:11:58,057
You and me.

1471
00:12:01,695 --> 00:12:02,684
I love you.

1472
00:12:03,931 --> 00:12:05,421
Sorry, I forgot my beer.

1473
00:12:06,133 --> 00:12:09,500
This is my boyfriend, Darren.
So hit the bricks, porky.

1474
00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:12,302
Okay. Nice to meet you, Darren.

1475
00:12:12,506 --> 00:12:13,495
Satan.

1476
00:12:17,878 --> 00:12:20,403
I'm sorry about
hitting on you before--

1477
00:12:20,614 --> 00:12:22,377
-You should be.
-I am. I am.

1478
00:12:22,583 --> 00:12:25,484
I just, I wasn't thinking in....

1479
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:29,550
You're so beautiful, and I....

1480
00:12:31,492 --> 00:12:32,481
I'm sorry.

1481
00:12:33,427 --> 00:12:36,225
So make up for it. Buy me a drink.

1482
00:12:37,097 --> 00:12:39,224
-Yeah. Okay.
-I'll have a Scotch.

1483
00:12:39,433 --> 00:12:42,300
Give the lady a Scotch,
and I'll have another beer.

1484
00:12:42,503 --> 00:12:45,563
-He'll have a gin and tonic.
-Make that a gin and tonic.

1485
00:12:49,109 --> 00:12:52,408
Can you believe he hooked up
with the queen of all hotties?

1486
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:55,374
They're just having a drink together.

1487
00:12:55,582 --> 00:12:59,143
It's not like they're
going steady or anything.

1488
00:13:02,122 --> 00:13:04,488
It's midnight.
You know what that means?

1489
00:13:04,692 --> 00:13:06,626
No. What?

1490
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:08,657
It's our six-week anniversary.

1491
00:13:10,898 --> 00:13:13,093
-Did you get me anything?
-No.

1492
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:15,063
That's okay. That's okay.

1493
00:13:15,269 --> 00:13:16,759
No big deal. But...

1494
00:13:18,272 --> 00:13:19,705
...I...

1495
00:13:20,441 --> 00:13:22,705
...got you a little something.

1496
00:13:24,378 --> 00:13:26,209
Thanks. That's really nice.

1497
00:13:32,119 --> 00:13:34,451
You know, I've been thinking.

1498
00:13:36,857 --> 00:13:39,621
We've been together for a while now...

1499
00:13:39,827 --> 00:13:42,193
...and it seems like
maybe it's time...

1500
00:13:43,831 --> 00:13:47,494
...we get a little more intimate.

1501
00:13:48,802 --> 00:13:51,032
Are you saying you want to have sex?

1502
00:13:52,973 --> 00:13:54,463
Yeah, I am.

1503
00:13:54,675 --> 00:13:58,634
I don't believe in premarital sex.
I'd rather not cheapen what we have.

1504
00:13:58,846 --> 00:14:02,111
Of course. Of course not.
Me neither.

1505
00:14:02,316 --> 00:14:04,307
-So it's best to wait.
-You're right.

1506
00:14:04,518 --> 00:14:07,885
I think-- I mean, you're--
It's best.

1507
00:14:08,922 --> 00:14:10,150
But...

1508
00:14:10,591 --> 00:14:12,923
...that doesn't mean that we can't...

1509
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:15,988
...pleasure each other in other ways.

1510
00:14:22,102 --> 00:14:23,626
I got you.

1511
00:14:23,837 --> 00:14:25,395
Oh, I got you.

1512
00:14:37,317 --> 00:14:39,478
That was really great.

1513
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:41,048
Thanks.

1514
00:14:43,357 --> 00:14:45,757
That got me pretty excited.

1515
00:14:47,327 --> 00:14:48,919
That's nice.

1516
00:14:49,129 --> 00:14:53,725
I mean, I wouldn't mind if someone
did that to me.

1517
00:14:54,168 --> 00:14:57,035
Oh, I get it.
You want me to go down on you.

1518
00:14:59,473 --> 00:15:01,532
I would love to, but I can't.

1519
00:15:01,742 --> 00:15:04,438
I have very, very sensitive gums.

1520
00:15:07,114 --> 00:15:10,311
You have gums--
It's a medical condition.

1521
00:15:11,385 --> 00:15:14,616
I wouldn't want to cause you
any pain, baby. No.

1522
00:15:15,155 --> 00:15:16,713
You're so sweet.

1523
00:15:22,029 --> 00:15:26,898
You know, there are other ways to give
me pleasure without using your mouth.

1524
00:15:27,234 --> 00:15:30,260
Oh, God, I am so inconsiderate.
I'm sorry.

1525
00:15:30,504 --> 00:15:33,735
No, that's fine. That's fine.

1526
00:15:38,545 --> 00:15:40,035
Have fun.

1527
00:15:44,218 --> 00:15:46,880
-Watch your head.
-This place is a dump.

1528
00:15:48,088 --> 00:15:50,283
I really don't want to do this.

1529
00:15:51,258 --> 00:15:56,059
It'll be great. It's our Sunday ritual
and I want you to be part of it.

1530
00:15:56,263 --> 00:16:00,393
I want you to get to know these guys.
You'll love them, honey.

1531
00:16:01,602 --> 00:16:06,005
-Yeah, buddy. What's up, dude?
-What's up, J.D.?

1532
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:09,175
Judy, awesome to meet you.

1533
00:16:09,409 --> 00:16:10,637
Judith.

1534
00:16:10,844 --> 00:16:13,904
Judith. And a beer bong for the lady?

1535
00:16:14,248 --> 00:16:16,045
-No.
-Totally cool.

1536
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:18,445
No peer pressure.

1537
00:16:24,625 --> 00:16:28,083
Judith rules. Sorry. Come on in.

1538
00:16:29,129 --> 00:16:30,528
Check it out. Chewie.

1539
00:16:32,332 --> 00:16:33,697
You want a drink?

1540
00:16:34,201 --> 00:16:36,101
-Scotch on the rocks.
-You want ice?

1541
00:16:36,303 --> 00:16:38,271
I'll help you with that.

1542
00:16:39,439 --> 00:16:41,964
Hey, Judith.
Can I give you the grand tour?

1543
00:16:42,543 --> 00:16:45,478
Let's start right here
in the "Hall o' Neil."

1544
00:16:45,779 --> 00:16:49,647
This is Neil, '74. Check this out.

1545
00:16:49,950 --> 00:16:53,886
This is a set list
from the Millennium Concert. Look:

1546
00:16:54,121 --> 00:16:56,453
Signed by Neil. Got that on eBay.

1547
00:16:57,291 --> 00:16:58,781
Looks like a Xerox.

1548
00:16:58,992 --> 00:17:02,393
No. This cost a lot of money.
Check this out.

1549
00:17:02,629 --> 00:17:05,063
-I think you got taken.
-Ready?

1550
00:17:05,299 --> 00:17:06,698
This shirt...

1551
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:08,663
...was worn by Neil...

1552
00:17:10,037 --> 00:17:11,698
...in concert.

1553
00:17:11,905 --> 00:17:14,305
Check it out. We snuck backstage...

1554
00:17:14,508 --> 00:17:18,069
...and totally stole it from him
while he was taking a whiz.

1555
00:17:18,278 --> 00:17:21,270
In my profession, we call
your obsession with Neil...

1556
00:17:21,481 --> 00:17:23,813
...a delusional projection fantasy.

1557
00:17:24,017 --> 00:17:28,647
Yeah, sure. But he's America's
greatest songwriter and he's our hero.

1558
00:17:28,855 --> 00:17:31,449
And he's playing the Forum
in two weeks.

1559
00:17:31,658 --> 00:17:36,220
Of course, we can't go because
of the whole restraining order thing.

1560
00:17:44,605 --> 00:17:46,835
Neil, I love you!

1561
00:17:47,107 --> 00:17:48,096
You again!

1562
00:17:52,613 --> 00:17:54,308
Neil! Where are you going?

1563
00:17:54,514 --> 00:17:58,450
I want to party with you.
I want to party with you!

1564
00:18:00,354 --> 00:18:00,420
Game's on.

1565
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:01,682
Game's on.

1566
00:18:04,725 --> 00:18:06,590
-Give me the remote.
-I want to go.

1567
00:18:06,793 --> 00:18:08,727
-Give me a beer.
-We just got here.

1568
00:18:08,929 --> 00:18:10,419
These guys are pigs.

1569
00:18:10,631 --> 00:18:13,031
Come on. No, they're not that--

1570
00:18:14,101 --> 00:18:15,966
Hey! What are you doing?

1571
00:18:16,203 --> 00:18:20,435
Dude, if you get the nachos
stuck together, that's one nacho.

1572
00:18:20,641 --> 00:18:25,203
Okay, look. Why don't we just stay
for a little bit, okay?

1573
00:18:26,079 --> 00:18:28,172
Oh, take mine. Take mine.

1574
00:18:28,415 --> 00:18:30,178
Give her the old sweep-a-roo.

1575
00:18:30,384 --> 00:18:33,683
Old Ethel. We've been through
a lot of games together.

1576
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:35,217
Enjoy.

1577
00:18:36,156 --> 00:18:39,057
I'll help you.
She has multiple reclining positions.

1578
00:18:39,259 --> 00:18:41,227
-I can sit forward.
-It's stuck.

1579
00:18:41,895 --> 00:18:43,829
-It's fine.
-Takes a little muscle.

1580
00:18:44,064 --> 00:18:46,692
Come on, you fucking piece of shit.

1581
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:49,061
-I don't need--
-It's no trouble.

1582
00:18:50,737 --> 00:18:51,704
Are you okay?

1583
00:18:51,905 --> 00:18:54,669
I'm sorry. That hardly ever happens.

1584
00:18:54,908 --> 00:18:57,172
You know what? I think I-- Yep.

1585
00:18:57,411 --> 00:19:00,346
It's the lug nut. Fixed it.
Please have a seat.

1586
00:19:01,348 --> 00:19:02,815
I'll stand.

1587
00:19:03,583 --> 00:19:04,845
I'm a--

1588
00:19:07,187 --> 00:19:10,020
-Sorry.
-Get me something.

1589
00:19:13,627 --> 00:19:17,085
So Darren tells me
you're a psychologist.

1590
00:19:18,331 --> 00:19:19,992
-That's right.
-Interesting.

1591
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,758
I'm in a related field.

1592
00:19:22,102 --> 00:19:23,433
Really? What's that?

1593
00:19:23,737 --> 00:19:25,432
Pest and rodent removal.

1594
00:19:25,939 --> 00:19:27,839
How is that related?

1595
00:19:28,542 --> 00:19:29,804
We both help people.

1596
00:19:30,010 --> 00:19:33,173
While you deal with their emotional
and intellectual needs...

1597
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:36,713
...I protect them from gophers,
coons, roaches, silverfish....

1598
00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:38,144
He launched it.

1599
00:19:38,885 --> 00:19:40,182
Touchdown!

1600
00:19:51,798 --> 00:19:55,199
I don't want you to see
Wayne or J.D. ever again, Darren!

1601
00:19:55,402 --> 00:19:57,131
But they're my best friends.

1602
00:19:57,370 --> 00:20:01,534
You're getting new friends, and you're
quitting that bullshit band.

1603
00:20:01,875 --> 00:20:06,175
I know you're upset. I do.
But I am not dropping Wayne and J.D...

1604
00:20:06,379 --> 00:20:08,506
...and I'm not quitting the band.

1605
00:20:09,049 --> 00:20:11,210
Okay, fine. No more sex.

1606
00:20:11,618 --> 00:20:12,550
What?

1607
00:20:12,753 --> 00:20:14,744
You're not allowed to go down on me
for one month.

1608
00:20:14,955 --> 00:20:16,013
No, Judith, please--

1609
00:20:16,223 --> 00:20:19,852
Don't make me take away
your masturbation privileges.

1610
00:20:41,548 --> 00:20:45,507
You go, boys. You sing this song.
You know it. Come on, boys. Sing it!

1611
00:20:45,719 --> 00:20:48,187
-Sing it!
-This blows, man.

1612
00:20:49,990 --> 00:20:52,584
Judith's out of control.
We gotta do something.

1613
00:20:52,793 --> 00:20:55,853
Besides ruining the band,
what else has she done?

1614
00:20:56,062 --> 00:20:59,498
Ever since she moved in with him,
she's controlled his life.

1615
00:20:59,699 --> 00:21:02,930
She didn't like his ass.
Made him get butt-cheek implants.

1616
00:21:08,074 --> 00:21:10,634
I thought his ass looked tighter.

1617
00:21:10,877 --> 00:21:12,640
Check this out. Last night...

1618
00:21:13,213 --> 00:21:15,545
...torched his Neil Diamond albums.

1619
00:21:16,149 --> 00:21:17,309
She torched Neil?

1620
00:21:23,657 --> 00:21:25,522
You're right. She's a monster.

1621
00:21:25,725 --> 00:21:27,625
Two, three, four.

1622
00:21:45,979 --> 00:21:47,537
-Hey!
-Yes!

1623
00:21:47,747 --> 00:21:50,113
-Hey, guys, sorry I'm late.
-It's all right.

1624
00:21:50,317 --> 00:21:53,081
I only have a minute.
I have to wax Judith's legs.

1625
00:21:53,286 --> 00:21:55,754
-We miss you.
-We never see you anymore.

1626
00:21:55,956 --> 00:21:57,389
I know, I'm sorry...

1627
00:21:57,591 --> 00:22:00,924
...but I've just been so happy
spending time with Judith.

1628
00:22:01,127 --> 00:22:03,357
Plus, my relationship
counseling sessions--

1629
00:22:03,563 --> 00:22:04,655
Counseling?

1630
00:22:04,865 --> 00:22:07,732
Yeah. I go two hours,
three times a week.

1631
00:22:07,934 --> 00:22:09,663
Oh. Who's your counselor?

1632
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:10,894
Judith.

1633
00:22:11,104 --> 00:22:13,334
We don't think she's right for you.

1634
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:15,030
Break up with her.

1635
00:22:15,275 --> 00:22:17,800
She's ruining our lives and yours.

1636
00:22:18,011 --> 00:22:20,104
This graph should
illustrate our point.

1637
00:22:20,313 --> 00:22:24,716
Before Judith, our fun level
was at an all-time high: 93.

1638
00:22:24,951 --> 00:22:26,714
It is now an eight.

1639
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:29,013
Band numbers have
plunged dramatically.

1640
00:22:29,222 --> 00:22:33,921
Girls, never very high, at nine.
But look now. Two!

1641
00:22:34,127 --> 00:22:36,220
This has led to increased wanking off.

1642
00:22:36,463 --> 00:22:37,953
I'm chafing.

1643
00:22:39,299 --> 00:22:41,426
Shit, I gotta go home
and heat the wax.

1644
00:22:41,635 --> 00:22:45,332
Guys, listen.
Thanks for your concern, really.

1645
00:22:45,538 --> 00:22:49,304
I miss you too. But it was great
seeing you, all right?

1646
00:22:55,982 --> 00:22:58,314
That guy's in serious trouble.

1647
00:22:59,152 --> 00:23:01,120
We need to save him.

1648
00:23:03,423 --> 00:23:04,856
Sorry to bother you.

1649
00:23:05,058 --> 00:23:06,650
What are you doing here?

1650
00:23:07,327 --> 00:23:09,591
We want to apologize
for the beer shower.

1651
00:23:09,829 --> 00:23:11,763
And the salsa bath. That was bad.

1652
00:23:11,998 --> 00:23:15,229
-Get the hell out of here.
-Just give us a minute, okay?

1653
00:23:15,435 --> 00:23:17,460
My rate is $200 an hour.

1654
00:23:18,338 --> 00:23:19,999
Do you have any money?

1655
00:23:20,674 --> 00:23:22,164
I got some of that.

1656
00:23:24,444 --> 00:23:26,241
Just give me the big bills.

1657
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:28,805
Six. Is that all you have?

1658
00:23:29,015 --> 00:23:30,846
Thirty. $7.38.

1659
00:23:34,554 --> 00:23:36,215
Two and a half minutes.

1660
00:23:36,923 --> 00:23:40,825
We don't want you seeing Darren.
We don't think you're right for him.

1661
00:23:41,027 --> 00:23:42,221
The band needs him.

1662
00:23:42,429 --> 00:23:45,660
-But we're prepared to buy you off.
-With what?

1663
00:23:47,467 --> 00:23:48,934
My house.

1664
00:23:49,202 --> 00:23:50,760
Okay? Look.

1665
00:23:51,905 --> 00:23:56,001
My grandma here? She was born in this
house, is buried in the back yard.

1666
00:23:56,576 --> 00:23:57,873
There's my mom...

1667
00:23:58,078 --> 00:24:00,546
...there's my dad and there's me.

1668
00:24:01,214 --> 00:24:04,775
My dad was dropping me
on my head. But...

1669
00:24:05,285 --> 00:24:08,777
...we're willing to sign
this over to you...

1670
00:24:08,989 --> 00:24:11,549
...if you just agree
not to see Darren.

1671
00:24:11,758 --> 00:24:14,420
I don't want your shitty house
or your dead grandma.

1672
00:24:15,095 --> 00:24:17,791
I'll throw J.D. in.
He doesn't look like much...

1673
00:24:17,998 --> 00:24:19,431
...but he's hung like a horse.

1674
00:24:19,632 --> 00:24:20,929
It's true.

1675
00:24:21,167 --> 00:24:24,330
Look, Darren's mine.
There's nothing you can do about it.

1676
00:24:24,537 --> 00:24:28,234
I own him. He does whatever I say.
I'm in complete control of him.

1677
00:24:28,441 --> 00:24:31,308
He's my puppet
and I'm his puppet master.

1678
00:24:31,511 --> 00:24:33,206
You're not taking Darren away!

1679
00:24:33,413 --> 00:24:34,505
Just try to stop me.

1680
00:24:37,050 --> 00:24:38,745
One round, winner takes Darren.

1681
00:24:38,952 --> 00:24:40,044
-You're on.
-Kick her ass.

1682
00:24:40,253 --> 00:24:41,345
Go.

1683
00:24:42,355 --> 00:24:45,847
You've got quite a grip.
You must be a heavy masturbator.

1684
00:24:46,059 --> 00:24:48,721
My guess is three times a day?

1685
00:24:48,928 --> 00:24:50,919
I bet you're a premature ejaculator.

1686
00:24:51,131 --> 00:24:52,962
You start off with a big bang.

1687
00:24:53,166 --> 00:24:55,498
Before you know it, you're limp.

1688
00:24:55,935 --> 00:24:59,166
-I win, you lose. Now get out.
-God!

1689
00:25:09,115 --> 00:25:10,548
Hey, check it out.

1690
00:25:14,387 --> 00:25:15,786
Hey, baby.

1691
00:25:16,022 --> 00:25:18,388
Hello, ladies.

1692
00:25:19,025 --> 00:25:20,356
So how much?

1693
00:25:20,894 --> 00:25:24,352
Fifty bucks for you,
and 200 for your friend.

1694
00:25:26,499 --> 00:25:28,160
-Okay.
-All right.

1695
00:25:28,835 --> 00:25:31,531
I want you to laugh
like he just said something.

1696
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,964
Perfect!

1697
00:25:35,308 --> 00:25:38,505
Get this one.
Be like this. Like this.

1698
00:25:38,711 --> 00:25:39,575
Douche, douche.

1699
00:25:39,946 --> 00:25:42,005
Yeah, you. Slap his ass.

1700
00:25:44,651 --> 00:25:46,642
That's not sexy.

1701
00:25:56,096 --> 00:25:57,757
Watch it.

1702
00:26:00,366 --> 00:26:02,163
You're moving my guy!

1703
00:26:08,541 --> 00:26:10,475
Lookit. Lookit.

1704
00:26:15,348 --> 00:26:16,576
Good.

1705
00:26:19,586 --> 00:26:21,110
-Awesome.
-Check this out.

1706
00:26:24,791 --> 00:26:28,124
Mail, check. Go. Don't look back.

1707
00:26:29,295 --> 00:26:30,284
Hurry up. Come on.

1708
00:26:31,598 --> 00:26:33,293
Hi, Judith. How's it going?

1709
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:36,663
Not so good. Look at these.

1710
00:26:39,205 --> 00:26:40,536
Oh, my God.

1711
00:26:42,575 --> 00:26:43,803
He's sick.

1712
00:26:44,010 --> 00:26:44,874
He's perverted.

1713
00:26:45,078 --> 00:26:48,241
-He's cheating on you.
-With two chicks.

1714
00:26:48,448 --> 00:26:50,678
I don't know. I guess I'd dump him?

1715
00:26:50,884 --> 00:26:52,875
-Oh, totally.
-Right?

1716
00:26:53,419 --> 00:26:57,219
Do you guys notice anything weird
about these photos?

1717
00:26:57,457 --> 00:26:59,618
No, that's Darren, all right.

1718
00:27:02,328 --> 00:27:04,728
Darren doesn't have a tattoo.

1719
00:27:06,733 --> 00:27:07,859
Nice try, idiots.

1720
00:27:08,468 --> 00:27:10,959
If I ever see you near Darren again...

1721
00:27:11,404 --> 00:27:12,803
...I'll kill you.

1722
00:27:24,484 --> 00:27:28,944
Thanks for meeting me here.
I have something important to say.

1723
00:27:29,155 --> 00:27:31,089
Oh, man. You broke up?

1724
00:27:31,324 --> 00:27:32,621
No.

1725
00:27:33,826 --> 00:27:37,922
Out of the blue,
Judith proposed to me. We're engaged.

1726
00:27:38,164 --> 00:27:41,190
-What?
-Dude, congratulations.

1727
00:27:42,335 --> 00:27:45,463
Starting next week,
I'll be Mr. Darren Fessbeggler.

1728
00:27:45,672 --> 00:27:49,039
Right, because you're gonna take
her last name, huh?

1729
00:27:49,242 --> 00:27:50,266
Yeah, well...

1730
00:27:50,510 --> 00:27:54,002
...Judith feels, and I think she's got
a really good point here...

1731
00:27:54,214 --> 00:27:57,479
...that it's sexist for the woman
to take the man's last name.

1732
00:27:58,685 --> 00:28:00,744
Anyway, it's too late to change it.

1733
00:28:00,954 --> 00:28:03,855
We've already ordered
the monogrammed towels.

1734
00:28:04,357 --> 00:28:05,790
Darren.

1735
00:28:06,125 --> 00:28:07,422
Sandy?

1736
00:28:07,627 --> 00:28:08,924
Sandy Perkus.

1737
00:28:09,128 --> 00:28:12,359
Oh, my God, Darren.
It's been so long.

1738
00:28:12,565 --> 00:28:13,964
Yeah, it has.

1739
00:28:15,235 --> 00:28:16,259
Hey, it's Wayne.

1740
00:28:16,469 --> 00:28:19,029
High school, remember? You remember?

1741
00:28:25,912 --> 00:28:29,109
Right! The senior talent show.

1742
00:28:29,315 --> 00:28:32,216
Yeah, you were booed off the stage.

1743
00:28:33,453 --> 00:28:34,818
That was me.

1744
00:28:35,054 --> 00:28:37,352
Yep. Sandy, remember me?
J.D. McNugent?

1745
00:28:38,057 --> 00:28:39,786
I went to the prom...

1746
00:28:39,993 --> 00:28:43,019
...with a tuxedo painted
on my naked body.

1747
00:28:43,229 --> 00:28:45,288
Oh, I guess I missed it.

1748
00:28:45,665 --> 00:28:50,068
I spilled a drink and the paint ran
and everyone could see my dong.

1749
00:28:50,436 --> 00:28:52,904
It doesn't ring a bell.

1750
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:57,869
Remember, in science, I was lighting
farts with the Bunsen burner...

1751
00:28:58,077 --> 00:29:00,341
...and I singed my ball sac?

1752
00:29:01,914 --> 00:29:02,972
No.

1753
00:29:03,249 --> 00:29:06,878
Man. I still can't grow hair
on my left nut.

1754
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:08,844
Sucks.

1755
00:29:10,256 --> 00:29:12,190
So how are you?

1756
00:29:12,425 --> 00:29:15,155
Great. Great.
I just moved back to town.

1757
00:29:15,361 --> 00:29:16,988
Oh, wow, that's great.

1758
00:29:17,764 --> 00:29:21,666
Gosh, you know, I have to go,
but it was great seeing you.

1759
00:29:21,868 --> 00:29:24,462
Yeah, same here. Me too.

1760
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:28,439
-See you.
-Take care.

1761
00:29:28,641 --> 00:29:29,767
-Okay, bye.
-Awesome.

1762
00:29:29,976 --> 00:29:32,376
Yeah, bye. Bye.

1763
00:29:34,647 --> 00:29:36,012
Oh, my God.

1764
00:29:36,215 --> 00:29:37,739
-This is it!
-What?

1765
00:29:37,950 --> 00:29:42,114
It's your big chance. Sandy Perkus
has just walked back into your life.

1766
00:29:42,622 --> 00:29:46,023
You even said so yourself.
She was your one and only someone!

1767
00:29:46,225 --> 00:29:49,456
She used to be.
Now Judith is my one and only someone.

1768
00:29:49,662 --> 00:29:52,631
I'll talk to you guys later. Okay?

1769
00:29:53,333 --> 00:29:56,302
Isn't "one and only" like, one...

1770
00:29:57,704 --> 00:29:59,137
...and only?

1771
00:30:06,245 --> 00:30:08,839
-Here's your drink.
-Where's the lemon wedge?

1772
00:30:09,048 --> 00:30:11,539
We're out of lemons,
but I'll run to the store--

1773
00:30:11,751 --> 00:30:14,743
Forget it. I want you to meet
two exciting people.

1774
00:30:15,555 --> 00:30:18,319
Brett is a tax attorney,
and Clayton's a CPA.

1775
00:30:18,524 --> 00:30:20,992
Wow, that is exciting.

1776
00:30:21,194 --> 00:30:22,821
This is my fiancé, Darren.

1777
00:30:23,029 --> 00:30:24,428
-Pleased to meet you.
-Same.

1778
00:30:24,630 --> 00:30:26,359
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

1779
00:30:26,566 --> 00:30:27,863
Excuse me, I'll get it.

1780
00:30:34,507 --> 00:30:38,204
Is Darren here?
I think he left his Vespa helmet.

1781
00:30:38,411 --> 00:30:39,400
What's going on?

1782
00:30:39,879 --> 00:30:41,813
We're having our engagement party.

1783
00:30:42,014 --> 00:30:46,747
Oh, then I guess our invitations
must've been lost in the mail.

1784
00:30:46,953 --> 00:30:48,545
No.

1785
00:30:48,788 --> 00:30:52,485
I think it's very possible
she didn't even send us invitations.

1786
00:30:54,327 --> 00:30:56,955
-Thanks for stopping by.
-Who's Darren talking to?

1787
00:30:57,397 --> 00:30:59,365
Those are his new friends.

1788
00:31:02,502 --> 00:31:04,595
-I'll have a merlot.
-A spritzer.

1789
00:31:05,304 --> 00:31:08,205
-We don't work here.
-You fooled me.

1790
00:31:08,408 --> 00:31:11,070
-My name's Brett, this is Clayton.
-This is Darren.

1791
00:31:11,277 --> 00:31:14,212
Yeah, we know who he is, Clayton.

1792
00:31:14,414 --> 00:31:18,043
-Darren's our friend, Brett.
-We knew him first.

1793
00:31:18,251 --> 00:31:20,082
Fuck you, replacement friend!

1794
00:31:20,286 --> 00:31:22,914
Eat this, fake Wayne!

1795
00:31:26,993 --> 00:31:28,551
Stop it! Do something!

1796
00:31:35,301 --> 00:31:36,325
Get out of here!

1797
00:31:43,743 --> 00:31:45,267
Hey, this isn't over yet!

1798
00:31:45,478 --> 00:31:47,241
We're not giving up on Darren!

1799
00:31:55,021 --> 00:31:57,387
She thinks this gig is over.

1800
00:31:57,590 --> 00:31:59,353
It's not over. No!

1801
00:31:59,592 --> 00:32:02,925
But we are taking this into overtime!

1802
00:32:03,963 --> 00:32:05,988
Yeah! Okay, strategy session.

1803
00:32:06,499 --> 00:32:09,662
-Okay, our enemy is wicked.
-Dude, she's Freddy Krueger.

1804
00:32:09,869 --> 00:32:11,632
-No, Damien.
-Dude, she's Vader.

1805
00:32:11,838 --> 00:32:13,567
No, she is the Emperor!

1806
00:32:13,773 --> 00:32:15,263
But with really great tits.

1807
00:32:15,475 --> 00:32:18,842
Okay, now, Sandy?
That girl, she's a nice girl.

1808
00:32:19,045 --> 00:32:20,945
-She's a sweetheart.
-Dude, a saint.

1809
00:32:21,147 --> 00:32:22,444
-A goddess.
-A princess.

1810
00:32:22,648 --> 00:32:25,481
You know what?
She's kind of like Mother Teresa.

1811
00:32:25,685 --> 00:32:27,243
But with way better tits.

1812
00:32:27,453 --> 00:32:30,911
And Darren loves Sandy
no matter what he says.

1813
00:32:31,123 --> 00:32:32,090
Definitely.

1814
00:32:32,291 --> 00:32:35,260
That's why we have to intervene
and fix the problem!

1815
00:32:35,461 --> 00:32:37,486
-Definitely!
-All right!

1816
00:32:38,297 --> 00:32:41,892
We're gonna kidnap Judith
and set Darren up with Sandy.

1817
00:32:44,637 --> 00:32:45,797
What?

1818
00:32:51,644 --> 00:32:54,044
The bat is leaving the cave.

1819
00:32:54,814 --> 00:32:56,748
Roger that.

1820
00:33:13,733 --> 00:33:17,328
Alarm system has been deactivated.
Out.

1821
00:33:17,537 --> 00:33:19,004
Roger that.

1822
00:33:19,906 --> 00:33:21,703
Dude, you don't have to do the--

1823
00:33:21,908 --> 00:33:24,502
--sound. It already does that. Out.

1824
00:33:24,710 --> 00:33:26,701
Copy that.
I'm not going to make the--

1825
00:33:26,913 --> 00:33:29,677
--sound after I say stuff
from now on.

1826
00:33:31,050 --> 00:33:32,176
Shady McNugent...

1827
00:33:32,385 --> 00:33:33,682
...over and out.

1828
00:33:34,687 --> 00:33:36,450
That was the last one.

1829
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:50,760
-I'm scared. What if we get caught?
-Not gonna happen.

1830
00:33:57,076 --> 00:33:58,703
I'm hungry.

1831
00:33:59,312 --> 00:34:00,677
We'll eat later.

1832
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:04,577
-Can we go to Happy Burger?
-Yes, after the kidnapping.

1833
00:34:04,784 --> 00:34:07,082
I'm gonna get a Chubby Checker with--

1834
00:34:08,955 --> 00:34:10,547
With cheese.

1835
00:34:26,906 --> 00:34:28,339
What?

1836
00:34:36,849 --> 00:34:41,115
You go downstairs and I'll check
upstairs. Do the Navy SEAL signals.

1837
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:44,255
I only know the Air Force signals.

1838
00:34:44,890 --> 00:34:46,482
I'll be on the lookout.

1839
00:34:46,759 --> 00:34:47,987
God!

1840
00:34:55,935 --> 00:34:58,768
-I haven't located heryet.
-Me neither.

1841
00:34:59,405 --> 00:35:00,531
Keep checking.

1842
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:05,372
Wait a second. I think I see
something in the back of the refrig--

1843
00:35:06,045 --> 00:35:07,603
In the back of the closet.

1844
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:09,308
Check it out.

1845
00:35:09,782 --> 00:35:11,943
Nope. Coast is clear.

1846
00:35:12,151 --> 00:35:16,588
I'll keep looking down here, buddy.
You keep an eye peeled up there.

1847
00:35:33,939 --> 00:35:34,997
Oh, shit.

1848
00:35:36,842 --> 00:35:37,831
What is it?

1849
00:35:38,077 --> 00:35:40,739
I'm hit. I need backup.

1850
00:35:41,681 --> 00:35:42,875
I'm coming.

1851
00:35:46,318 --> 00:35:47,546
What happ--

1852
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:15,707
Help!

1853
00:36:31,864 --> 00:36:33,798
Dead leg.

1854
00:36:36,035 --> 00:36:37,866
Help me, Wayne.

1855
00:36:44,677 --> 00:36:46,144
Oh, my God.

1856
00:36:59,325 --> 00:37:02,522
Get the door. Get the door. Door.

1857
00:37:33,526 --> 00:37:36,120
Darren, I'm leaving you.
We're finished. Done.

1858
00:37:36,462 --> 00:37:38,521
Don't call, write, e-mail or fax.

1859
00:37:38,731 --> 00:37:41,859
I never want to see your face
oryour fake butt again.

1860
00:38:13,265 --> 00:38:14,425
Okay, get down there.

1861
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,968
Dude, wait. Why me?

1862
00:38:17,169 --> 00:38:21,071
Because you're guarding Judith.
I'm dealing with Darren and Sandy.

1863
00:38:21,273 --> 00:38:24,333
But when we let her go,
she'll be able to identify me.

1864
00:38:24,577 --> 00:38:28,274
No. She won't be able to
because you'll be wearing this.

1865
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:32,507
But after we let her go, the cops will
look for a guy dressed as a bird.

1866
00:38:32,751 --> 00:38:34,981
-So?
-So, what am I gonna wear to work?

1867
00:38:35,187 --> 00:38:36,381
Your work clothes.

1868
00:38:36,589 --> 00:38:38,648
But tomorrow's casual Friday.

1869
00:38:39,191 --> 00:38:41,421
Get downstairs!

1870
00:38:48,067 --> 00:38:49,364
Who the hell are you?

1871
00:39:09,655 --> 00:39:12,453
Thanks for meeting me.
I called you out of the blue--

1872
00:39:12,658 --> 00:39:16,617
That's okay. I love catching up
with old high school friends.

1873
00:39:16,829 --> 00:39:18,660
-Are you single?
-Yes.

1874
00:39:18,864 --> 00:39:22,994
Great. Look, I wanted to talk
to you about Darren Silverman.

1875
00:39:23,202 --> 00:39:24,601
He's a really good guy.

1876
00:39:24,837 --> 00:39:27,704
You know what?
He works with the elderly.

1877
00:39:27,907 --> 00:39:29,169
Really?

1878
00:39:29,508 --> 00:39:32,739
-That is so sweet.
-He still talks about you.

1879
00:39:32,945 --> 00:39:33,934
There's something--

1880
00:39:34,179 --> 00:39:37,740
He even writes poems about you.
In fact...

1881
00:39:38,250 --> 00:39:39,512
...I think he loves you.

1882
00:39:40,019 --> 00:39:42,419
Wayne, I'm gonna become a nun.

1883
00:39:44,790 --> 00:39:46,985
In a week, I take my final vows.

1884
00:39:47,192 --> 00:39:50,593
I didn't even know
that you were religious.

1885
00:39:50,796 --> 00:39:52,423
I wasn't in high school.

1886
00:39:52,631 --> 00:39:56,397
But after I graduated,
I joined my parents in the circus.

1887
00:39:56,602 --> 00:39:58,263
And I became a trapeze artist.

1888
00:40:00,439 --> 00:40:02,907
I fell in love
with mypartner, Luigi Panini.

1889
00:40:03,108 --> 00:40:07,067
Ladies and gentlemen,
the fabulous Luigi!

1890
00:40:07,313 --> 00:40:10,043
And everything was perfect until....

1891
00:40:10,249 --> 00:40:12,444
Talent scouts were in the audience.

1892
00:40:12,751 --> 00:40:14,776
Luigi wanted to impress them.

1893
00:40:14,987 --> 00:40:18,286
He was a great trapeze artist,
but he was completely vain.

1894
00:40:18,490 --> 00:40:21,357
And now Luigi will attempt
the most dangerous stunt...

1895
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:23,187
...in the history of trapeze...

1896
00:40:23,395 --> 00:40:26,057
...the Quadruple Bierman.

1897
00:40:41,780 --> 00:40:43,771
Luigi!

1898
00:40:46,085 --> 00:40:48,144
-Wow.
-Yeah.

1899
00:40:48,354 --> 00:40:52,484
After Luigi died,
I knew I would never love again.

1900
00:40:52,691 --> 00:40:57,355
That's when I decided to devote my life
to serving God and helping others.

1901
00:40:57,596 --> 00:41:01,498
So you haven't taken
your final vows yet, right?

1902
00:41:01,934 --> 00:41:06,701
-Right.
-So technically, you're not a nun yet.

1903
00:41:06,939 --> 00:41:09,305
Well, no. I mean, not yet.

1904
00:41:09,508 --> 00:41:12,272
So why not then just
have lunch with Darren?

1905
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:16,841
I can't figure out why Judith left.

1906
00:41:17,049 --> 00:41:20,507
It doesn't make any sense.
She didn't even take her clothes.

1907
00:41:20,719 --> 00:41:24,587
Maybe she went where she didn't
need clothes: a nudist colony.

1908
00:41:24,790 --> 00:41:27,156
-I don't think so.
-Maybe she got kidnapped.

1909
00:41:27,693 --> 00:41:29,558
-You think?
-No.

1910
00:41:29,795 --> 00:41:31,888
Definitely not. That's impossible.

1911
00:41:32,131 --> 00:41:35,396
It's like, why would that
happen in a world?

1912
00:41:35,768 --> 00:41:37,429
Maybe she's a lesbo.

1913
00:41:37,903 --> 00:41:38,801
Come on.

1914
00:41:39,004 --> 00:41:41,097
Maybe she's a herm.

1915
00:41:42,474 --> 00:41:44,465
-What?
-A hermaphrodite.

1916
00:41:44,676 --> 00:41:46,701
Little dick, little puss.

1917
00:41:50,449 --> 00:41:52,747
-Guess who I bumped into today.
-Who?

1918
00:41:52,951 --> 00:41:56,478
Sandy Perkus,
and she wants to see you.

1919
00:41:56,688 --> 00:41:59,521
-I'm engaged to Judith, Wayne.
-She dumped you, dude.

1920
00:41:59,725 --> 00:42:02,694
Just have lunch with Sandy.
What's it gonna hurt?

1921
00:42:02,895 --> 00:42:05,455
No way. Judith's coming back.

1922
00:42:06,065 --> 00:42:07,396
What if she doesn't?

1923
00:42:07,633 --> 00:42:10,625
As long as Judith's alive,
I'll never give up on her.

1924
00:42:10,836 --> 00:42:12,463
Okay? Okay?

1925
00:42:17,876 --> 00:42:20,902
I got it. Crowbar me.

1926
00:42:24,049 --> 00:42:25,141
Oh, my God.

1927
00:42:25,417 --> 00:42:28,716
-What is it?
-This dead chick is really stacked.

1928
00:42:34,093 --> 00:42:35,583
Okay, go, go. Go.

1929
00:42:37,096 --> 00:42:39,064
-What are you doing?
-Jacket's caught.

1930
00:42:39,264 --> 00:42:40,424
Take it off!

1931
00:42:40,666 --> 00:42:42,258
I love this jacket!

1932
00:42:43,001 --> 00:42:43,990
Lose it!

1933
00:43:01,019 --> 00:43:05,012
Damn! That was my favorite jacket.

1934
00:43:08,927 --> 00:43:11,953
In a bizarre incident last night,
Judith Fessbeggler...

1935
00:43:12,164 --> 00:43:14,962
...was incinerated beyond
recognition when herBMW...

1936
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:16,929
...careened offa cliff.

1937
00:43:17,136 --> 00:43:21,539
Investigators have declared it an
accident. No foul play is suspected.

1938
00:43:23,542 --> 00:43:26,978
In unrelated news, the body of
deceased local Joan Snerd...

1939
00:43:27,212 --> 00:43:31,808
...was dug up in a grave robbing last
night. Police arrested three Cubans.

1940
00:43:43,328 --> 00:43:46,456
-Why are you doing this?
-So you can eat and have clothes.

1941
00:43:47,432 --> 00:43:49,161
No, why did you kidnap me?

1942
00:43:49,401 --> 00:43:51,232
I'm not supposed to tell you.

1943
00:43:51,503 --> 00:43:54,233
Oh, I get it.
The other guy's the boss.

1944
00:43:55,807 --> 00:43:58,674
No, I make decisions too.

1945
00:43:59,011 --> 00:44:00,740
I suggested that.

1946
00:44:01,313 --> 00:44:02,712
An outhouse. Clever.

1947
00:44:02,915 --> 00:44:03,882
Thanks.

1948
00:44:04,082 --> 00:44:06,710
-You must be very well-educated.
-I suppose.

1949
00:44:06,919 --> 00:44:08,910
-Ivy League?
-More or less.

1950
00:44:09,121 --> 00:44:12,181
-Which one? Yale, Harvard, Princeton?
-S.U.

1951
00:44:12,424 --> 00:44:13,857
Oh, Stanford University?

1952
00:44:16,128 --> 00:44:18,119
Subway University.

1953
00:44:18,330 --> 00:44:22,266
I knew someone who went there.
Did you know J.D. McNugent?

1954
00:44:22,467 --> 00:44:26,335
No. No. Never heard
of such a person, ever.

1955
00:44:27,873 --> 00:44:30,865
-See you later, J.D.
-Take it easy, Judith.

1956
00:44:32,778 --> 00:44:34,405
Goddamn it!

1957
00:44:34,613 --> 00:44:38,014
-She knows who we are?!
-There was nothing I could do.

1958
00:44:38,217 --> 00:44:41,744
She used her super-intellect on me.
She's like Hannibal Lecter.

1959
00:44:41,954 --> 00:44:45,788
-Great. Now we can't let her go.
-So, what are we going to do?

1960
00:44:47,326 --> 00:44:48,588
-Coach.
-Coach!

1961
00:44:48,794 --> 00:44:51,422
If it ain't my favorite
third-string quarterback...

1962
00:44:51,630 --> 00:44:54,622
...and the best damn mascot
Wheaton High School ever had.

1963
00:44:54,833 --> 00:44:56,698
Lookit, he's still got it!

1964
00:44:58,036 --> 00:45:01,528
It's good seeing you boys.
Thank you for coming to my trial.

1965
00:45:01,740 --> 00:45:05,141
No problem. We were happy to act
as witnesses on your behalf.

1966
00:45:05,344 --> 00:45:07,972
That ref blew.
He deserved what he got.

1967
00:45:11,850 --> 00:45:13,147
Touchdown!

1968
00:45:13,518 --> 00:45:15,884
No touchdown. He's out-of-bounds.

1969
00:45:16,321 --> 00:45:17,913
-What?!
-He's out-of-bounds.

1970
00:45:32,571 --> 00:45:37,372
You think after you get out of prison
they'll let you get your old job back?

1971
00:45:37,576 --> 00:45:40,340
Well, boys, I don't think so.

1972
00:45:40,545 --> 00:45:42,308
So when will they let you out?

1973
00:45:42,514 --> 00:45:46,041
Well, I've got an appeal pending,
but it doesn't look good.

1974
00:45:46,251 --> 00:45:49,345
The victim's whiny
family's protesting.

1975
00:45:49,554 --> 00:45:51,613
What's their damn problem?

1976
00:45:52,224 --> 00:45:53,987
So, what brings you boys here?

1977
00:45:54,192 --> 00:45:56,251
Well, coach, we need your advice.

1978
00:45:56,461 --> 00:45:57,758
Okay, shoot.

1979
00:45:57,963 --> 00:46:00,523
Darren fell in love
with this girl, Judith.

1980
00:46:00,732 --> 00:46:03,758
-And we kidnapped her.
-Kill her.

1981
00:46:04,369 --> 00:46:06,564
Wait a minute and let me finish.

1982
00:46:06,772 --> 00:46:10,299
So we screwed up because now
she knows who we are.

1983
00:46:10,542 --> 00:46:13,636
So we can't let her go,
or she'll turn us in.

1984
00:46:13,879 --> 00:46:15,437
Is that everything?

1985
00:46:18,383 --> 00:46:19,645
Kill her.

1986
00:46:20,719 --> 00:46:22,186
We can't kill her.

1987
00:46:22,387 --> 00:46:26,016
You can! Wheaton Warbirds can do
anything they put their minds to.

1988
00:46:26,224 --> 00:46:29,489
But, coach, I mean, come on,
actually kill a person?

1989
00:46:29,928 --> 00:46:32,453
What is it that I always said?

1990
00:46:32,664 --> 00:46:35,189
If you can dream it, you can do it.

1991
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:36,458
Exactly.

1992
00:46:36,668 --> 00:46:40,866
You have the dream. All you have
to do is turn it into reality.

1993
00:46:41,073 --> 00:46:42,700
-Okay.
-Thattaboy!

1994
00:46:42,941 --> 00:46:44,806
Now, go on home and snuff her.

1995
00:46:45,010 --> 00:46:47,240
-Come on, move.
-Thanks, coach.

1996
00:46:53,051 --> 00:46:54,518
Where's your bird suit?

1997
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:57,484
I don't need it, because we're--

1998
00:46:58,824 --> 00:47:01,725
Because we're gonna kill you. Right?

1999
00:47:03,829 --> 00:47:05,729
You aren't going to shoot me.

2000
00:47:05,931 --> 00:47:07,330
What makes you say that?

2001
00:47:07,699 --> 00:47:09,223
Because you're not killers.

2002
00:47:09,434 --> 00:47:10,526
Sure we are.

2003
00:47:10,736 --> 00:47:12,169
You've never killed anyone.

2004
00:47:12,371 --> 00:47:13,360
I killed a man once.

2005
00:47:13,572 --> 00:47:14,539
-Oh, really?
-Yeah.

2006
00:47:14,740 --> 00:47:17,334
-Who?
-Kevin Beckley.

2007
00:47:17,542 --> 00:47:20,511
You didn't kill Kevin Beckley.
He died in a car wreck.

2008
00:47:21,847 --> 00:47:24,873
-She doesn't know that. Goddamn it.
-You see?

2009
00:47:25,083 --> 00:47:28,484
You guys have never killed anything
in your entire lives.

2010
00:47:28,687 --> 00:47:32,851
One time, this squirrel ran out
into the street and I ran over him...

2011
00:47:33,058 --> 00:47:37,586
...and he didn't die right then, but
I'm pretty sure he died right after.

2012
00:47:38,296 --> 00:47:42,255
It doesn't matter if we've killed
or not! We're gonna do it right now!

2013
00:47:42,467 --> 00:47:44,697
-Ready?!
-Ready.

2014
00:47:46,905 --> 00:47:49,169
-Do it.
-I can't!

2015
00:47:49,374 --> 00:47:50,773
Goddamn it!

2016
00:47:59,951 --> 00:48:02,476
-Okay, it's Tuesday.
-So?

2017
00:48:02,721 --> 00:48:04,780
So you're meeting Sandy for lunch.

2018
00:48:04,990 --> 00:48:06,617
Can't you see I'm in mourning?

2019
00:48:06,825 --> 00:48:10,283
But you promised you'd be there.
You gave her your word.

2020
00:48:10,762 --> 00:48:12,457
I didn't even talk to her.

2021
00:48:12,664 --> 00:48:14,894
Okay, I gave her your word.

2022
00:48:15,100 --> 00:48:19,730
For God's sakes, when will you give up
this idea that I'll go out with Sandy?

2023
00:48:19,938 --> 00:48:22,236
When you go out with Sandy.

2024
00:48:23,842 --> 00:48:25,503
Now, come on.

2025
00:48:26,478 --> 00:48:29,606
Come on. Come on. Come on, come on.

2026
00:48:39,324 --> 00:48:41,849
Come on! All right! Come on!

2027
00:48:46,331 --> 00:48:48,993
Hey! Wow, you're wearing the--

2028
00:48:49,201 --> 00:48:51,431
I'm training to become a nun.

2029
00:48:51,636 --> 00:48:54,104
A nun. Well, that explains it.

2030
00:48:54,606 --> 00:48:57,439
-I hope it doesn't freak you out.
-No, it doesn't.

2031
00:48:57,642 --> 00:48:59,906
Actually, I'm relieved.

2032
00:49:00,111 --> 00:49:04,104
I think Wayne was trying
to set us up on a date.

2033
00:49:04,316 --> 00:49:07,843
Oh, yeah.
He's got some crazy ideas.

2034
00:49:08,053 --> 00:49:12,319
Yeah. Well, now that I know
that you're unavailable...

2035
00:49:12,524 --> 00:49:13,855
...it makes this easier.

2036
00:49:14,059 --> 00:49:15,549
We can just be friends.

2037
00:49:15,794 --> 00:49:17,227
Exactly. Friends.

2038
00:49:17,896 --> 00:49:19,124
Please.

2039
00:49:19,698 --> 00:49:21,563
-Thank you.
-Sure.

2040
00:49:22,901 --> 00:49:24,459
So how are your parents?

2041
00:49:24,669 --> 00:49:27,763
Oh, great. They're making
a fortune on the lnternet.

2042
00:49:27,973 --> 00:49:30,737
They started their own Web site,
circusfreak.com.

2043
00:49:31,543 --> 00:49:32,908
Wow, good for them.

2044
00:49:33,245 --> 00:49:35,270
And how's your brother, Dog-face Boy?

2045
00:49:35,480 --> 00:49:36,879
He got rabies.

2046
00:49:37,315 --> 00:49:39,283
-God, that's too bad.
-Yeah.

2047
00:49:39,484 --> 00:49:42,419
We thought we were gonna
have to put him down...

2048
00:49:42,621 --> 00:49:44,179
...but he recovered.

2049
00:49:44,389 --> 00:49:46,186
Oh, good. Good.

2050
00:49:46,391 --> 00:49:47,790
So how are you?

2051
00:49:47,993 --> 00:49:50,325
Oh, me? I'm great.

2052
00:49:50,562 --> 00:49:53,963
Yeah, everything's been
really good, you know?

2053
00:49:54,165 --> 00:49:55,462
Yeah.

2054
00:49:56,935 --> 00:49:58,800
Well, my fiancée died.

2055
00:49:59,070 --> 00:50:00,094
She died?

2056
00:50:00,305 --> 00:50:01,272
Yeah, she's dead.

2057
00:50:01,473 --> 00:50:03,464
-I am so sorry.
-Oh, don't be.

2058
00:50:03,675 --> 00:50:05,905
Please don't be sorry.

2059
00:50:06,411 --> 00:50:08,140
It's nothing.

2060
00:50:09,447 --> 00:50:12,143
So how do you feel about....

2061
00:50:17,022 --> 00:50:18,421
Oh, no.

2062
00:50:18,623 --> 00:50:23,219
Oh, gosh. Just cry. Let it out.

2063
00:50:23,428 --> 00:50:26,625
I'm here for you, okay?
I'm here for you.

2064
00:50:26,831 --> 00:50:28,093
Thank you.

2065
00:50:38,109 --> 00:50:42,136
Wait a minute. Wait.
You're a Neil Diamond fan too?

2066
00:50:42,347 --> 00:50:44,941
Oh! The man's a genius.

2067
00:50:45,150 --> 00:50:46,515
Yeah!

2068
00:50:46,718 --> 00:50:50,415
He's the greatest songwriter-performer
of this or any generation.

2069
00:50:50,622 --> 00:50:51,611
I know.

2070
00:51:04,502 --> 00:51:06,129
Oh, God.

2071
00:51:13,378 --> 00:51:15,073
I brought you some more videos.

2072
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:17,714
You got your choice:
Porno or monster trucks.

2073
00:51:17,916 --> 00:51:19,941
-And I got one that's both.
-Thanks, J.D.

2074
00:51:20,151 --> 00:51:22,915
I really appreciate you
taking care of me.

2075
00:51:23,455 --> 00:51:24,444
My pleasure.

2076
00:51:24,656 --> 00:51:28,114
Hey, you strike me as
a pretty responsible guy.

2077
00:51:28,326 --> 00:51:29,315
Thanks.

2078
00:51:29,527 --> 00:51:33,054
That's why I'm surprised
that you let Wayne boss you around.

2079
00:51:34,966 --> 00:51:35,990
Wayne's not--

2080
00:51:36,201 --> 00:51:39,659
No one bosses me around.
Wayne's not the boss of me.

2081
00:51:40,038 --> 00:51:44,031
Yeah. I think that you
seem depressed and confused.

2082
00:51:44,242 --> 00:51:45,641
You think?

2083
00:51:45,844 --> 00:51:48,438
You have a self-defeating
personality disorder.

2084
00:51:50,615 --> 00:51:52,344
Have you considered therapy?

2085
00:51:54,452 --> 00:51:58,218
I remember in high school, you were
really into helping people.

2086
00:51:58,423 --> 00:52:01,221
At parties, you were always
the designated driver.

2087
00:52:01,426 --> 00:52:04,361
Right. And I remember you
were a really good dancer.

2088
00:52:04,562 --> 00:52:08,464
And strong too. You used to be
able to lift me up over your head.

2089
00:52:08,667 --> 00:52:10,066
Still can.

2090
00:52:10,301 --> 00:52:11,632
Oh, really?

2091
00:52:12,470 --> 00:52:14,631
Ready? And....

2092
00:52:19,044 --> 00:52:20,534
-Oh, Darren!
-Help me!

2093
00:52:20,745 --> 00:52:22,372
Are you okay?

2094
00:52:22,580 --> 00:52:23,808
-I can't--
-Just hang on.

2095
00:52:25,917 --> 00:52:27,145
I can't swim.

2096
00:52:43,735 --> 00:52:44,895
Darren!

2097
00:52:45,870 --> 00:52:47,428
Are you okay?

2098
00:52:47,672 --> 00:52:50,766
Thank you. Thank you for saving me.

2099
00:52:52,510 --> 00:52:54,102
No problem.

2100
00:53:03,254 --> 00:53:07,020
Let it out now. There you go.

2101
00:53:09,194 --> 00:53:10,183
Come on.

2102
00:53:10,462 --> 00:53:11,759
Let's go, okay?

2103
00:53:15,600 --> 00:53:18,330
You're a lot stronger
than you were in high school.

2104
00:53:18,536 --> 00:53:21,937
Yeah, well, the convent's
got a great gym.

2105
00:53:25,343 --> 00:53:28,244
And ever since then,
I've been afraid of toilets.

2106
00:53:28,446 --> 00:53:30,744
What else can I say
about second grade?

2107
00:53:30,949 --> 00:53:32,610
J.D., let's fast-forward.

2108
00:53:32,817 --> 00:53:35,684
-Have you ever had a girlfriend?
-Yes.

2109
00:53:35,887 --> 00:53:36,876
No.

2110
00:53:37,122 --> 00:53:40,182
Have you ever fantasized
about having sex with a man?

2111
00:53:40,391 --> 00:53:41,858
-Which man?
-Any man.

2112
00:53:42,060 --> 00:53:44,358
-You mean, like, a tall man?
-Sure, whatever.

2113
00:53:44,562 --> 00:53:47,360
-I don't like tall people.
-How about a short man?

2114
00:53:47,632 --> 00:53:52,035
How short? Sometimes people can be
too short. That's weird, like midgets.

2115
00:53:52,370 --> 00:53:56,101
Have you fantasized about having
sex with any man? Any man at all?

2116
00:53:56,307 --> 00:53:58,639
Does that include celebrities?

2117
00:54:00,979 --> 00:54:03,038
-Can I ask you something?
-Sure.

2118
00:54:03,248 --> 00:54:07,241
I mean, not that it matters now...

2119
00:54:07,852 --> 00:54:12,653
...but if I had asked you out back
in high school, would you have gone?

2120
00:54:13,691 --> 00:54:15,124
Definitely.

2121
00:54:16,494 --> 00:54:19,554
-Not that it matters now, you know.
-Right.

2122
00:54:24,569 --> 00:54:26,503
-Perfect.
-Thanks.

2123
00:54:27,472 --> 00:54:29,838
Could you, you know, turn around?

2124
00:54:30,041 --> 00:54:31,531
Right. Yeah, certainly.

2125
00:54:40,351 --> 00:54:42,012
I have these.

2126
00:54:43,721 --> 00:54:45,746
Sorry, sorry, those are....

2127
00:54:46,324 --> 00:54:47,256
Thanks.

2128
00:55:00,071 --> 00:55:02,471
-Can you zip me up?
-Yeah.

2129
00:55:05,543 --> 00:55:07,374
I had a really good time.

2130
00:55:07,579 --> 00:55:08,841
Me too.

2131
00:55:09,047 --> 00:55:11,538
-Do you want to have dinner tonight?
-I can't.

2132
00:55:11,749 --> 00:55:14,513
Tomorrow I have a test in my
catechism class...

2133
00:55:14,719 --> 00:55:19,520
...and I have to score at least an 85
so I can take my vows on Sunday.

2134
00:55:19,824 --> 00:55:21,086
What about tomorrow?

2135
00:55:21,292 --> 00:55:25,626
I'm scheduled to take care
of an elderly nun on her death bed.

2136
00:55:26,030 --> 00:55:27,361
I understand.

2137
00:55:27,565 --> 00:55:29,897
But I'd really like to see you again.

2138
00:55:31,035 --> 00:55:32,593
I'll get out of it.

2139
00:55:33,104 --> 00:55:33,137
I always knew I was different,
and now I know why.

2140
00:55:33,137 --> 00:55:36,402
I always knew I was different,
and now I know why.

2141
00:55:36,608 --> 00:55:38,599
I'm gay.

2142
00:55:39,544 --> 00:55:43,708
You're the only person
who's ever truly understood me.

2143
00:55:43,915 --> 00:55:46,713
It's okay. Just let it out.

2144
00:55:46,918 --> 00:55:48,749
Everything will be all right.

2145
00:55:48,953 --> 00:55:51,513
It's all gonna be okay.

2146
00:55:51,723 --> 00:55:53,384
It's gonna be just--

2147
00:56:31,829 --> 00:56:33,854
Judith escaped.

2148
00:56:34,866 --> 00:56:35,890
Der!

2149
00:56:40,772 --> 00:56:44,799
Get to the truck. Go. Go. Go. Go.

2150
00:56:58,056 --> 00:57:00,524
Okay, she can't be far.

2151
00:57:02,260 --> 00:57:03,249
I see her!

2152
00:57:03,461 --> 00:57:05,088
Where? Okay, steady, steady!

2153
00:57:07,899 --> 00:57:08,991
I missed her.

2154
00:57:14,572 --> 00:57:16,403
Now. Let's go. Go, go!

2155
00:57:16,641 --> 00:57:18,871
You go this way,
I'll go that way! Go!

2156
00:57:28,019 --> 00:57:30,613
Open up! I've been kidnapped!

2157
00:57:32,957 --> 00:57:34,322
Hold your goddamn horses!

2158
00:57:34,759 --> 00:57:36,124
Oh, thank God. Hurry up.

2159
00:57:40,865 --> 00:57:43,265
Tonight Mr. Chang gets lucky.

2160
00:57:45,470 --> 00:57:47,631
Young lady, so horny, so impatient.

2161
00:57:52,477 --> 00:57:54,809
Oh, scrotum!

2162
00:57:56,714 --> 00:57:59,376
Dude, she's stealing the truck!
Come on!

2163
00:58:03,287 --> 00:58:05,778
-Now! I got her.
-Do her! Come on!

2164
00:58:06,090 --> 00:58:07,648
I got her.

2165
00:58:17,168 --> 00:58:19,159
Okay, Judith, it's over.

2166
00:58:19,404 --> 00:58:23,067
You might as well turn around
and head back to the house.

2167
00:58:35,686 --> 00:58:36,675
Oh, thank God.

2168
00:58:59,811 --> 00:59:02,712
Hi, officers. You're safe.

2169
00:59:03,114 --> 00:59:04,911
I'm Cowboy Wayne.

2170
00:59:05,383 --> 00:59:08,580
I just bagged me
one of them killer goats...

2171
00:59:08,786 --> 00:59:11,448
...that escaped from the zoo.

2172
00:59:12,356 --> 00:59:14,051
-Good job.
-Yeah.

2173
00:59:14,292 --> 00:59:16,954
Okay, then, I'll see you later.

2174
00:59:30,074 --> 00:59:32,440
There. That should
hold you for tonight.

2175
00:59:33,644 --> 00:59:34,906
Don't!

2176
00:59:40,084 --> 00:59:41,915
What the hell happened?

2177
00:59:42,920 --> 00:59:44,888
Judith was giving me some therapy...

2178
00:59:45,089 --> 00:59:47,557
...and helped me realize
I was gay and--

2179
00:59:47,825 --> 00:59:49,349
Wait. What?

2180
00:59:50,328 --> 00:59:51,659
I see what happened.

2181
00:59:52,697 --> 00:59:54,426
She messed with your head.

2182
00:59:54,665 --> 00:59:56,292
Wayne, I'm gay.

2183
00:59:56,501 --> 00:59:59,959
No, you're not.
You're just unsuccessful with women.

2184
01:00:00,171 --> 01:00:04,403
No, I'm gay. Judith got me
in touch with the inner J.D.

2185
01:00:04,609 --> 01:00:05,735
How'd she do that?

2186
01:00:05,943 --> 01:00:07,410
She listened.

2187
01:00:07,845 --> 01:00:12,782
Unlike people who knew me for years
and ignored all the telltale signs.

2188
01:00:12,984 --> 01:00:15,748
-Like what?
-Like my obsession with Bette Midler.

2189
01:00:15,953 --> 01:00:17,784
My preference for track lighting.

2190
01:00:17,989 --> 01:00:20,753
And the fact that I like sucking dick.

2191
01:00:20,992 --> 01:00:23,358
What?! You've done that?!

2192
01:00:24,061 --> 01:00:27,997
Not with another guy, but remember
when I bought that book on yoga?

2193
01:00:28,199 --> 01:00:29,894
I don't want to hear anymore.

2194
01:00:30,101 --> 01:00:33,537
Look, you want to be gay?
Fine! No problem!

2195
01:00:33,738 --> 01:00:36,536
But from now on,
I'll take care of Judith myself.

2196
01:00:36,741 --> 01:00:37,969
Okay!

2197
01:00:42,613 --> 01:00:45,047
-You want to be gay with me?
-No!

2198
01:00:50,188 --> 01:00:51,849
Come on, go, come on.

2199
01:00:52,056 --> 01:00:54,684
All you, all you! Eleven. Okay.

2200
01:00:54,892 --> 01:00:57,952
One more. One more.
Come on. One more.

2201
01:00:58,996 --> 01:01:00,896
Feel the burn. Come on, now.

2202
01:01:03,167 --> 01:01:04,361
Eleven.

2203
01:01:05,336 --> 01:01:06,564
What's the matter, dear?

2204
01:01:07,205 --> 01:01:11,039
You never used to be so winded
after only five sets.

2205
01:01:11,242 --> 01:01:13,574
Well, Mother Superior...

2206
01:01:14,412 --> 01:01:19,111
...I'm having some second thoughts
about becoming a nun.

2207
01:01:19,684 --> 01:01:21,117
Oh, don't get me wrong.

2208
01:01:21,319 --> 01:01:24,550
This is a terrific convent. But I--

2209
01:01:24,755 --> 01:01:25,983
But....

2210
01:01:26,257 --> 01:01:27,246
Well...

2211
01:01:28,426 --> 01:01:31,793
...I'm having these feelings.

2212
01:01:32,029 --> 01:01:33,428
What kind of feelings?

2213
01:01:37,401 --> 01:01:39,392
You mean sexual feelings.

2214
01:01:41,172 --> 01:01:43,470
Yeah, but it's so much more than that.

2215
01:01:43,674 --> 01:01:44,698
Yes, well...

2216
01:01:45,209 --> 01:01:46,608
...my dear...

2217
01:01:47,078 --> 01:01:51,481
...you're the only one who can decide
if this is the life you want to live.

2218
01:01:51,682 --> 01:01:54,116
But once you take your final vows...

2219
01:01:55,419 --> 01:01:57,649
...there is no going back.

2220
01:01:58,556 --> 01:02:02,014
Now, let's go bust out
some power squats.

2221
01:02:16,207 --> 01:02:21,042
There. That should keep you
from escaping again. And this....

2222
01:02:23,214 --> 01:02:24,374
This....

2223
01:02:24,949 --> 01:02:26,883
This should keep you from biting.

2224
01:02:27,752 --> 01:02:30,482
-How am I gonna eat?
-I thought of that.

2225
01:02:31,756 --> 01:02:33,314
-What is that?
-It's breakfast.

2226
01:02:33,557 --> 01:02:36,617
It's pancakes, sausage,
hash brown, Pop Tart, puréed.

2227
01:02:36,827 --> 01:02:38,988
I won't eat it. I want a Big Montana.

2228
01:02:39,196 --> 01:02:41,528
A Big Montana from Arby's
with curly fries.

2229
01:02:41,732 --> 01:02:46,032
I won't get you one. If you won't eat
what I made for you, you can starve!

2230
01:02:46,737 --> 01:02:48,568
Why are you doing this?!

2231
01:02:48,773 --> 01:02:50,638
To save our friendship.

2232
01:02:50,841 --> 01:02:53,810
Friendship? It seems like
you're in love with Darren.

2233
01:02:54,178 --> 01:02:55,475
Bullshit!

2234
01:02:55,680 --> 01:02:58,877
Just get over it.
Your buddy smokes pole and so do you.

2235
01:02:59,884 --> 01:03:01,545
I am so un-gay!

2236
01:03:01,752 --> 01:03:05,552
Let's pretend you're straight.
When's the last time you got any?

2237
01:03:05,756 --> 01:03:07,121
None of your business.

2238
01:03:07,658 --> 01:03:08,716
So it's been years?

2239
01:03:09,427 --> 01:03:12,658
-I'm waiting for the right woman.
-There is no right woman.

2240
01:03:12,863 --> 01:03:17,323
If there was, you've already met
and she's killed herself or become gay.

2241
01:03:17,768 --> 01:03:19,599
-Bite me!
-Blow me!

2242
01:03:19,837 --> 01:03:21,099
-Skank!
-Eunuch!

2243
01:03:21,572 --> 01:03:24,769
Stealer of my friend!

2244
01:03:32,450 --> 01:03:34,418
What happened to your head?

2245
01:03:38,055 --> 01:03:39,682
I saw Judith.

2246
01:03:40,191 --> 01:03:41,624
Judith's dead.

2247
01:03:41,859 --> 01:03:43,190
Yeah, but...

2248
01:03:43,427 --> 01:03:45,520
...I could've sworn it was her.

2249
01:03:45,730 --> 01:03:48,255
-I was on--
-You poor thing.

2250
01:03:48,466 --> 01:03:50,263
You're still not over her death.

2251
01:03:50,735 --> 01:03:53,329
Maybe we shouldn't be
seeing each other.

2252
01:03:54,038 --> 01:03:57,633
No. No. God, I'm fine.

2253
01:03:57,875 --> 01:04:00,537
And, look, I can deal
with this. Okay?

2254
01:04:04,715 --> 01:04:07,411
-So, what are you having?
-Let's see.

2255
01:04:07,618 --> 01:04:10,746
There's the duck.
That was always Judith's favorite.

2256
01:04:10,955 --> 01:04:12,513
-I'm sorry.
-I should leave.

2257
01:04:12,723 --> 01:04:14,782
No, you shouldn't. I'm so sorry.

2258
01:04:14,992 --> 01:04:18,291
I will never mention
Judith's name again, really.

2259
01:04:18,496 --> 01:04:20,293
I swear. I swear.

2260
01:04:23,234 --> 01:04:25,202
Would you excuse me for a moment?

2261
01:04:25,770 --> 01:04:29,069
Please. I'll be right back. Okay?

2262
01:04:29,273 --> 01:04:31,207
In a-- In a moment.

2263
01:04:37,515 --> 01:04:38,914
Damn it!

2264
01:04:42,920 --> 01:04:45,411
-What do you want?!
-Wayne, it's me, Darren.

2265
01:04:45,823 --> 01:04:50,055
I have a problem. I'm with Sandy,
but I can't stop talking about Judith.

2266
01:04:50,528 --> 01:04:52,826
Okay. I'll be right there.

2267
01:05:05,109 --> 01:05:07,077
Okay, open up your shirt.

2268
01:05:07,278 --> 01:05:08,973
-Why?
-Just do it.

2269
01:05:10,114 --> 01:05:11,809
What is this?

2270
01:05:13,951 --> 01:05:14,940
Now...

2271
01:05:15,619 --> 01:05:17,450
...here's what's gonna happen.

2272
01:05:19,390 --> 01:05:22,518
I'm going to listen
to your conversation.

2273
01:05:23,360 --> 01:05:24,452
Now...

2274
01:05:25,463 --> 01:05:28,626
...if you say anything about Judith...

2275
01:05:29,133 --> 01:05:31,693
...or so much as mention her name...

2276
01:05:31,902 --> 01:05:34,530
...then I'll give you a little shock.

2277
01:05:36,540 --> 01:05:37,802
Perfect.

2278
01:05:39,543 --> 01:05:43,070
I don't think I'm comfortable
having these things on my nipples.

2279
01:05:43,280 --> 01:05:44,975
I could put them on your balls.

2280
01:05:45,316 --> 01:05:47,648
The nipples are fine. Nipples work.

2281
01:05:50,321 --> 01:05:54,087
Hi. Sorry, sorry, sorry.
I'm back. I am back.

2282
01:05:54,325 --> 01:05:57,817
There was a talkative
men's room attendant.

2283
01:05:58,162 --> 01:05:59,151
That's okay.

2284
01:06:13,244 --> 01:06:14,802
-Excuse me.
-Hey.

2285
01:06:15,012 --> 01:06:17,071
-This table's reserved.
-You know what?

2286
01:06:17,281 --> 01:06:20,079
I come here all the time,
and spend a lot of money...

2287
01:06:20,284 --> 01:06:22,479
...so why not leave me the hell alone?

2288
01:06:25,189 --> 01:06:27,248
I don't mean to be pushy...

2289
01:06:27,458 --> 01:06:30,188
...but if this relationship
is gonna get serious...

2290
01:06:30,394 --> 01:06:32,294
...I have to give up becoming a nun...

2291
01:06:32,696 --> 01:06:34,857
...and I'd have to decide soon...

2292
01:06:35,533 --> 01:06:37,694
...because my final vows
are on Sunday.

2293
01:06:38,269 --> 01:06:40,464
Yeah, that thought had occurred to me.

2294
01:06:40,704 --> 01:06:42,194
And if I do that...

2295
01:06:42,406 --> 01:06:46,536
...I need to know that
you want marriage and a family.

2296
01:06:47,711 --> 01:06:48,700
Absolutely.

2297
01:06:50,881 --> 01:06:54,715
I never thought I'd say this to anyone
after Luigi died, but...

2298
01:06:55,753 --> 01:06:57,277
...I love you, Darren.

2299
01:07:01,091 --> 01:07:02,524
I love you too, Judith.

2300
01:07:05,362 --> 01:07:07,660
-Judith?!
-I mean Sandy.

2301
01:07:07,865 --> 01:07:11,596
I mean, let's dance. Okay?

2302
01:07:20,311 --> 01:07:21,403
You're out of here.

2303
01:07:21,612 --> 01:07:24,137
Put me down! I haven't ordered yet!

2304
01:07:27,585 --> 01:07:30,110
Time for an attitude
adjustment, mister.

2305
01:07:33,424 --> 01:07:35,255
Hey, nice move.

2306
01:07:43,267 --> 01:07:44,359
Damn, he's good.

2307
01:07:46,236 --> 01:07:47,396
Darren!

2308
01:07:52,509 --> 01:07:53,498
Oh, my God!

2309
01:07:53,844 --> 01:07:56,108
Oh, jeez. Oh, my God!

2310
01:07:59,149 --> 01:08:01,208
Are you okay?

2311
01:08:02,786 --> 01:08:04,219
It was a little weird.

2312
01:08:17,334 --> 01:08:19,063
-What's going on?
-I can explain.

2313
01:08:19,470 --> 01:08:24,100
It's aversion therapy. Wayne was
trying to help me get over Judith...

2314
01:08:24,308 --> 01:08:26,503
...so I had these things-- Nipples--

2315
01:08:26,710 --> 01:08:30,077
Oh, my God.
It's so much worse than I thought.

2316
01:08:30,280 --> 01:08:33,807
No, you're obviously not ready
for this relationship.

2317
01:08:34,985 --> 01:08:36,885
No, I am! Sandy, wait!

2318
01:08:38,122 --> 01:08:39,316
Okay.

2319
01:08:39,523 --> 01:08:40,547
Damn it!

2320
01:08:43,661 --> 01:08:45,151
Wait, wait.

2321
01:08:46,930 --> 01:08:48,659
Wait, Sandy!

2322
01:09:01,845 --> 01:09:03,540
Oh, my God!

2323
01:09:03,747 --> 01:09:05,806
Darren. What happened to you?

2324
01:09:06,016 --> 01:09:08,507
-I ran here from the club.
-That's 30 miles!

2325
01:09:08,719 --> 01:09:11,449
Yeah, I know. I wanted to say...

2326
01:09:12,022 --> 01:09:15,150
...I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Can you ever forgive me?

2327
01:09:16,026 --> 01:09:18,995
Because the whole Judith thing
and the nipple clamps...

2328
01:09:19,196 --> 01:09:20,322
-...it's crazy, and--
-Yes!

2329
01:09:21,899 --> 01:09:23,161
-Really?
-Yes.

2330
01:09:23,534 --> 01:09:24,694
Just like that?

2331
01:09:24,902 --> 01:09:27,700
Well, I am training
to become a nun, you know.

2332
01:09:27,905 --> 01:09:29,930
Forgiveness is just sort of my thing.

2333
01:09:30,207 --> 01:09:31,333
I love you.

2334
01:09:31,542 --> 01:09:32,566
-Really?
-I love you.

2335
01:09:32,776 --> 01:09:35,301
-I love you.
-Oh, love. Love.

2336
01:09:53,130 --> 01:09:55,724
-Happy?
-You didn't have to do that.

2337
01:09:55,933 --> 01:10:00,393
I just happened to be by Arby's.
They were throwing out old food...

2338
01:10:00,604 --> 01:10:03,095
...so, you know, I thought, "Why not?"

2339
01:10:03,307 --> 01:10:06,174
Either way, that's nice of you.

2340
01:10:13,417 --> 01:10:15,044
I was wondering:

2341
01:10:16,587 --> 01:10:18,919
-Why Darren?
-What do you mean?

2342
01:10:19,356 --> 01:10:22,814
You don't seem the type to go
for a sensitive guy like Darren.

2343
01:10:23,026 --> 01:10:27,656
You seem more the kind of woman
that needs an assertive type of guy.

2344
01:10:33,871 --> 01:10:36,203
Before I met Darren, I was--

2345
01:10:38,776 --> 01:10:40,869
I was engaged to a guy like that.

2346
01:10:41,578 --> 01:10:45,708
His idea of fun was to fly to Thailand
to fight in a kickboxing tournament.

2347
01:10:46,450 --> 01:10:47,849
U.S.A.! Go, Josh!

2348
01:11:11,408 --> 01:11:13,808
After that,
I decided no more tough guys.

2349
01:11:14,711 --> 01:11:16,679
Yeah, and then you found Darren.

2350
01:11:16,880 --> 01:11:17,938
Yeah.

2351
01:11:18,382 --> 01:11:21,977
-So do you even love him?
-There's different types of love.

2352
01:11:22,886 --> 01:11:24,410
I knew it!

2353
01:11:24,621 --> 01:11:28,682
Sometimes you make rational decisions.
You can't always follow your heart.

2354
01:11:29,026 --> 01:11:30,152
Yeah, whatever.

2355
01:11:30,527 --> 01:11:34,258
I will admit there's something sexy
about a man who takes charge.

2356
01:11:34,765 --> 01:11:36,733
Like you kidnapping me.

2357
01:11:37,868 --> 01:11:39,631
That took balls.

2358
01:11:40,237 --> 01:11:41,795
Big balls.

2359
01:11:42,973 --> 01:11:44,941
I gotta say it turned me on.

2360
01:11:46,610 --> 01:11:47,941
It did?

2361
01:12:27,417 --> 01:12:28,816
Oh, my God.

2362
01:12:34,524 --> 01:12:36,492
Goddamn these chains!

2363
01:12:41,198 --> 01:12:42,529
Little key, little key.

2364
01:12:43,267 --> 01:12:45,394
What am I doing? I can't let you go!

2365
01:12:45,769 --> 01:12:48,329
Just give me one free hand.
It'll be worth it.

2366
01:12:49,873 --> 01:12:52,137
Okay. Give me the fries.

2367
01:13:01,618 --> 01:13:03,279
-Hi.
-Wow.

2368
01:13:03,487 --> 01:13:04,681
Hey.

2369
01:13:05,222 --> 01:13:06,519
Shit.

2370
01:13:09,493 --> 01:13:11,620
Just wait one minute, okay?

2371
01:13:15,933 --> 01:13:17,764
-Dude--
-Dude, you got a boner?

2372
01:13:18,068 --> 01:13:19,057
No.

2373
01:13:19,269 --> 01:13:21,328
-Why didn't you answer the door?
-I'm eating.

2374
01:13:21,538 --> 01:13:23,005
-So?
-I don't answer when I'm eating.

2375
01:13:23,206 --> 01:13:24,503
-Since when?
-Since always.

2376
01:13:24,708 --> 01:13:27,700
-I never knew that.
-You didn't know a lot, like I'm gay.

2377
01:13:28,045 --> 01:13:31,344
-Anything else you want to tell me?
-I got three balls.

2378
01:13:31,548 --> 01:13:34,381
Shut up! God!

2379
01:13:35,953 --> 01:13:36,977
Dude.

2380
01:13:38,221 --> 01:13:39,245
Hi, coach.

2381
01:13:39,456 --> 01:13:40,923
What are you doing here?

2382
01:13:41,124 --> 01:13:43,558
Retrial. Got a judge
that's a sports fan.

2383
01:13:44,027 --> 01:13:46,018
-Congrats.
-What will you do now?

2384
01:13:46,229 --> 01:13:50,290
That's why I'm here. Need a place
to crash, figure out my next move.

2385
01:13:50,500 --> 01:13:52,161
I knew I could count on you.

2386
01:13:52,369 --> 01:13:55,566
-Well, we gotta talk about--
-You stay as long as you like.

2387
01:13:55,839 --> 01:13:58,706
Great! Where's the bathroom?
I gotta take a dump.

2388
01:13:58,909 --> 01:14:02,970
We don't use the toilet anymore since
we're cutting down on the water bill.

2389
01:14:03,180 --> 01:14:04,306
What do you do?

2390
01:14:04,514 --> 01:14:07,142
Well, we just use the lawn now.

2391
01:14:07,551 --> 01:14:09,246
Smart thinking.

2392
01:14:09,619 --> 01:14:10,608
Oh, God!

2393
01:14:10,988 --> 01:14:13,980
You pinch loaves on the lawn?
I play croquet out there.

2394
01:14:14,191 --> 01:14:16,523
Are you crazy? Coach can't stay here!

2395
01:14:16,727 --> 01:14:19,821
-We got a woman locked in the garage!
-Oh, yeah!

2396
01:14:24,768 --> 01:14:26,463
You boys got any T.P.?

2397
01:14:26,670 --> 01:14:28,001
No!

2398
01:14:28,305 --> 01:14:30,330
That's all right.
I'll find something.

2399
01:14:36,179 --> 01:14:39,114
Play it cool. We'll find
some way to get rid of him.

2400
01:14:39,349 --> 01:14:43,410
We tell him we got dates. He can't
be here because we're getting laid.

2401
01:14:43,620 --> 01:14:45,747
No, he'll never believe that.

2402
01:14:45,956 --> 01:14:47,787
We'll tell him we got ghosts.

2403
01:14:48,025 --> 01:14:50,152
So, boys, what's for supper?

2404
01:14:50,360 --> 01:14:52,851
-Listen, coach--
-We have ghosts.

2405
01:14:53,196 --> 01:14:57,189
We were thinking that maybe you
staying here's not such a great idea.

2406
01:14:57,401 --> 01:15:01,462
Nonsense. It'll give us a chance
to get to know one another again.

2407
01:15:01,705 --> 01:15:06,335
So you boys take care of that bitch
that was gonna marry Silverman?

2408
01:15:06,543 --> 01:15:10,206
Yeah, we snuffed that bitch
just like you said.

2409
01:15:10,714 --> 01:15:12,614
Good. How'd you do it?

2410
01:15:13,483 --> 01:15:14,507
-We--
-Ate her.

2411
01:15:15,118 --> 01:15:16,107
You ate her?

2412
01:15:16,386 --> 01:15:19,253
-Yeah. We ate her.
-Alive.

2413
01:15:19,456 --> 01:15:20,787
My hat goes off to you.

2414
01:15:20,991 --> 01:15:23,892
You boys are smart.
That's the perfect crime.

2415
01:15:24,961 --> 01:15:27,088
Wonder what's on the tube.

2416
01:15:27,397 --> 01:15:28,625
-No! Coach!
-No!

2417
01:15:29,900 --> 01:15:33,461
What the hell we got here?
Some kind of public access show?

2418
01:15:34,471 --> 01:15:36,598
That's the kidnap victim, ain't it?

2419
01:15:36,807 --> 01:15:37,967
You didn't kill her!

2420
01:15:38,175 --> 01:15:39,836
No. Coach, listen....

2421
01:15:40,043 --> 01:15:43,069
I am really disappointed in you boys.

2422
01:15:43,280 --> 01:15:45,908
I want you to go out there
and off that cooze.

2423
01:15:46,116 --> 01:15:47,481
We can't, coach.

2424
01:15:47,684 --> 01:15:50,312
Oh, for Pete's sakes!
Look! She's getting out!

2425
01:15:50,854 --> 01:15:53,288
Go chop her head off or something.

2426
01:15:54,324 --> 01:15:58,852
There's no fight left in you boys.
You're nutless. You been pussified.

2427
01:15:59,329 --> 01:16:02,992
Don't worry about a thing, boys.
I'll take care of that broad.

2428
01:16:09,506 --> 01:16:11,133
-Don't worry!
-Who are you?

2429
01:16:11,408 --> 01:16:14,809
Let's say I'm a friend of the boys,
and I'm here to kill you.

2430
01:16:15,078 --> 01:16:17,808
You don't mind if I try
to defend myself, do you?

2431
01:16:18,014 --> 01:16:20,915
Of course not.
I love a good challenge.

2432
01:16:41,538 --> 01:16:42,869
Are you okay?

2433
01:16:49,679 --> 01:16:50,703
Dude--

2434
01:16:58,488 --> 01:16:59,477
Got it?

2435
01:17:03,627 --> 01:17:06,391
-I'm so happy.
-Oh, me too.

2436
01:17:09,332 --> 01:17:11,129
Does this couch fold out?

2437
01:17:22,345 --> 01:17:24,643
What the hell is going on here?

2438
01:17:26,183 --> 01:17:27,241
-Judith!
-Yes.

2439
01:17:27,450 --> 01:17:28,917
-You're alive.
-Yes.

2440
01:17:29,119 --> 01:17:31,610
-Judith?
-Who is this tramp?

2441
01:17:31,821 --> 01:17:33,118
I'm not a tramp.

2442
01:17:33,323 --> 01:17:36,656
Actually, until yesterday,
I was training to become a nun.

2443
01:17:37,060 --> 01:17:39,756
I'm gone for a week,
and you're screwing a nun?

2444
01:17:39,963 --> 01:17:42,625
No, no. We're in love.

2445
01:17:43,166 --> 01:17:44,497
I thought you were dead.

2446
01:17:44,868 --> 01:17:48,167
Oh, really? Well, I'm not dead.
I was kidnapped, okay?

2447
01:17:48,371 --> 01:17:50,362
It was hell!
I was beaten, tortured...

2448
01:17:50,574 --> 01:17:53,600
...and treated like
a frigging farm animal!

2449
01:17:53,843 --> 01:17:55,105
And the entire time...

2450
01:17:55,312 --> 01:17:58,338
...the only thing that kept
me alive was the thought...

2451
01:17:58,848 --> 01:18:02,511
...that somewhere out there,
my sweet Darren still loved me...

2452
01:18:02,719 --> 01:18:05,187
...and that one day
we'd be together again.

2453
01:18:07,791 --> 01:18:09,088
It was so horrible.

2454
01:18:17,601 --> 01:18:21,697
-Where are we going?
-I don't know. We gotta find her.

2455
01:18:22,372 --> 01:18:24,237
-Okay, where to?
-Go left!

2456
01:18:24,441 --> 01:18:26,033
I'm going right!

2457
01:18:26,676 --> 01:18:29,008
They kept me in
a dark closet for days.

2458
01:18:29,212 --> 01:18:34,115
And they fed me, like,
crushed potato chips under the door.

2459
01:18:37,087 --> 01:18:40,488
Maybe I should go.

2460
01:18:40,724 --> 01:18:42,089
Oh, no.

2461
01:18:44,728 --> 01:18:46,628
Please. Please, don't.

2462
01:18:46,830 --> 01:18:48,798
Don't leave.

2463
01:18:48,999 --> 01:18:50,296
Well, but, I mean...

2464
01:18:50,500 --> 01:18:54,732
...Judith's alive,
and she is your fiancée.

2465
01:18:56,306 --> 01:18:59,673
I know. You're right.
You're right. But....

2466
01:19:00,076 --> 01:19:02,135
But you can't go because I....

2467
01:19:02,612 --> 01:19:05,479
-Because what? Why, Darren?
-Because I--

2468
01:19:06,016 --> 01:19:07,608
-See, you--
-Yeah?

2469
01:19:07,817 --> 01:19:09,250
-Well, we-- And--
-Yeah?

2470
01:19:09,452 --> 01:19:12,353
Sweetheart, we pledged
our love to one another.

2471
01:19:12,589 --> 01:19:15,217
Spare her the pain
of seeing us together.

2472
01:19:15,425 --> 01:19:16,585
You...

2473
01:19:16,826 --> 01:19:18,919
...run along back to the nunnery.

2474
01:19:24,267 --> 01:19:25,256
She's right.

2475
01:19:25,669 --> 01:19:27,000
I mean...

2476
01:19:27,337 --> 01:19:29,532
...I did pledge.

2477
01:19:31,708 --> 01:19:33,073
Okay.

2478
01:19:36,146 --> 01:19:37,204
Bye.

2479
01:19:40,150 --> 01:19:41,515
She's here! Hey, Darren.

2480
01:19:41,718 --> 01:19:44,949
Sandy, hi. Look, I can--
Darren. Sorry.

2481
01:19:45,155 --> 01:19:48,682
Darren, look. I understand
that you're really upset.

2482
01:19:48,892 --> 01:19:51,417
I probably look like
a really big asshole--

2483
01:19:51,628 --> 01:19:52,959
Dude!

2484
01:19:54,464 --> 01:19:58,901
Okay. I deserved that.
But now let me explain--

2485
01:20:03,973 --> 01:20:08,376
Okay, I guess I deserved that one too,
but now we're even, okay?

2486
01:20:12,949 --> 01:20:16,783
Stop! We only did it
because we love you.

2487
01:20:16,986 --> 01:20:18,851
Oh, right, because you love me.

2488
01:20:19,055 --> 01:20:22,149
Yeah, man. Come on.
Give me a hug. It's--

2489
01:20:35,538 --> 01:20:39,668
-Freeze!
-Get your hands up!

2490
01:20:49,486 --> 01:20:52,387
Don't think my presence here
means I forgive you.

2491
01:20:52,589 --> 01:20:55,422
I just wanted to tell
you guys in person.

2492
01:20:55,625 --> 01:20:58,116
Judith and I are
getting married tomorrow.

2493
01:20:58,328 --> 01:21:00,956
You don't want to marry Judith.
Admit it.

2494
01:21:01,297 --> 01:21:03,959
-Of course I do.
-Okay.

2495
01:21:04,434 --> 01:21:06,698
Then look into my eyes and say it.

2496
01:21:07,137 --> 01:21:09,105
I want to marry Judith.

2497
01:21:09,439 --> 01:21:12,966
Look into both our eyes
at the same time and say it.

2498
01:21:13,543 --> 01:21:15,067
I'm out of here.

2499
01:21:16,479 --> 01:21:19,812
Come on. We're sorry, okay?

2500
01:21:20,150 --> 01:21:22,050
What we did was wrong.

2501
01:21:25,722 --> 01:21:27,246
We gotta stop that wedding.

2502
01:21:27,457 --> 01:21:29,254
Dude, how?

2503
01:21:30,527 --> 01:21:35,123
Let's go, you maggots!
Kill! Kill! Kill!

2504
01:21:37,634 --> 01:21:41,126
Coach. Yeah, it's Wayne and J.D.
Look, we need your help.

2505
01:21:41,337 --> 01:21:44,534
I'd do anything for you boys.
Name it, you got it.

2506
01:21:44,741 --> 01:21:49,337
Well, we need you to post bail for us.
It's $10,000 apiece.

2507
01:21:49,579 --> 01:21:52,571
-No way!
-Come on, coach.

2508
01:21:52,782 --> 01:21:54,079
We need your help.

2509
01:21:54,317 --> 01:21:56,842
Jail life is real tough. They're--

2510
01:21:57,120 --> 01:21:59,645
They're sodomizing us in here.

2511
01:21:59,856 --> 01:22:02,188
What?! They're corn-holing you?

2512
01:22:02,392 --> 01:22:06,522
Oh, my God. That's horrible.
Don't worry. I'll get you out.

2513
01:22:07,697 --> 01:22:11,497
You got sodomized?
Who? I want to meet him.

2514
01:22:13,937 --> 01:22:14,904
What is that?

2515
01:22:15,104 --> 01:22:17,095
Sounds kind of like my truck.

2516
01:22:23,913 --> 01:22:25,278
Come on, boys. Let's go.

2517
01:22:26,583 --> 01:22:28,574
Get the lead out, boys! Hut, hut!

2518
01:22:29,519 --> 01:22:31,077
Come on, move it!

2519
01:22:31,855 --> 01:22:35,086
You're free. Now, where to, boys?

2520
01:22:35,358 --> 01:22:36,620
Go left.

2521
01:22:38,795 --> 01:22:40,092
Charge!

2522
01:22:42,732 --> 01:22:44,700
Sandy Perkus...

2523
01:22:45,034 --> 01:22:47,764
...do you vow to lead
a life of poverty...

2524
01:22:47,971 --> 01:22:49,871
...chastity, obedience...

2525
01:22:50,073 --> 01:22:51,768
...and silence?

2526
01:22:52,408 --> 01:22:53,875
Wait!

2527
01:22:55,044 --> 01:22:56,033
Sorry.

2528
01:22:57,881 --> 01:22:59,371
Look, you can't do this.

2529
01:22:59,616 --> 01:23:01,982
-You love Darren, right?
-Well, yeah.

2530
01:23:02,218 --> 01:23:04,379
-Well, Darren loves you.
-Really?

2531
01:23:04,621 --> 01:23:07,681
Darren's her boyfriend,
but he has this other girlfriend...

2532
01:23:07,891 --> 01:23:10,883
-...and he's getting--
-So, what are you gonna do?

2533
01:23:12,729 --> 01:23:14,492
Go, my child.

2534
01:23:15,064 --> 01:23:16,156
-Okay.
-Come on.

2535
01:23:16,399 --> 01:23:18,424
We've got a wedding to crash!

2536
01:23:18,635 --> 01:23:20,500
Go. Go. Go.

2537
01:23:20,737 --> 01:23:21,726
Bye, everybody!

2538
01:23:22,906 --> 01:23:25,101
Damn. Lost another one.

2539
01:23:25,308 --> 01:23:27,242
Son of a bitch.

2540
01:23:41,958 --> 01:23:43,983
I can't believe I'm doing this.

2541
01:23:44,193 --> 01:23:46,855
Oh, here. We got you some clothes.

2542
01:23:48,431 --> 01:23:50,399
Where did you get these?

2543
01:23:50,600 --> 01:23:51,624
J.D.'s sister.

2544
01:23:51,834 --> 01:23:54,428
-She's a stripper.
-And a hooker.

2545
01:24:12,055 --> 01:24:13,215
Go! Gotta go!

2546
01:24:18,227 --> 01:24:19,353
Oh, my gosh!

2547
01:24:19,562 --> 01:24:21,052
Neil Diamond!

2548
01:24:21,297 --> 01:24:22,764
What the hell is going on?

2549
01:24:22,966 --> 01:24:24,228
Neil, let me explain.

2550
01:24:24,434 --> 01:24:28,598
You're the guys who send me all those
letters and tapes. Naked pictures.

2551
01:24:28,805 --> 01:24:32,332
What? We never sent you
any naked pictures.

2552
01:24:32,709 --> 01:24:33,937
-Dude.
-Sorry.

2553
01:24:34,143 --> 01:24:36,941
Mr. Diamond, you gotta
help us save our buddy.

2554
01:24:37,146 --> 01:24:38,773
He's marrying the wrong woman.

2555
01:24:38,982 --> 01:24:41,177
Sandy and Darren, they broke up.

2556
01:24:41,384 --> 01:24:43,648
Love on the rocks.
Ain't no big surprise.

2557
01:24:43,853 --> 01:24:47,254
-Help us get them back together.
-I don't know.

2558
01:24:47,457 --> 01:24:50,324
Turn on your heart light.
Judith brainwashed him.

2559
01:24:50,526 --> 01:24:53,256
For years, Darren loved me,
but I never knew it.

2560
01:24:53,463 --> 01:24:54,896
Hold it. Hold it!

2561
01:24:55,732 --> 01:24:58,223
-Hold on.
-And did I mention I was gay?

2562
01:24:58,434 --> 01:25:01,699
I've spent my life writing songs
about the power of love...

2563
01:25:01,904 --> 01:25:04,771
...but up until right now,
they've only been words.

2564
01:25:05,008 --> 01:25:08,944
This may be my chance to prove that
those words really mean something.

2565
01:25:09,145 --> 01:25:12,239
-You say that if Darren marries...
-Judith.

2566
01:25:12,448 --> 01:25:14,939
-...Judith, he'll be miserable.
-Right.

2567
01:25:15,151 --> 01:25:19,144
I believe in happy endings. If Neil
Diamond has anything to do with it...

2568
01:25:19,355 --> 01:25:21,152
...this love story will have one.

2569
01:25:21,357 --> 01:25:23,416
Come on! Yeah!

2570
01:25:23,793 --> 01:25:26,660
We got Neil Diamond onboard!
All right!

2571
01:25:26,863 --> 01:25:29,593
-Where we going?
-The park on America Avenue.

2572
01:25:30,633 --> 01:25:32,430
-5-0!
-What?

2573
01:25:32,635 --> 01:25:33,795
Cops. Caprice.

2574
01:25:34,037 --> 01:25:36,267
Five cars back. Goddamn heat.

2575
01:25:36,472 --> 01:25:39,373
One little prison break,
and they're all over you.

2576
01:25:40,376 --> 01:25:41,604
Whoa, coach.

2577
01:25:42,211 --> 01:25:44,441
No matter what happens,
don't look back.

2578
01:25:44,647 --> 01:25:47,548
Just get this sweet gal
to the man who loves her.

2579
01:25:47,750 --> 01:25:51,709
I'd rather be cut down in a hail
of gunfire than to go back to jail.

2580
01:25:52,155 --> 01:25:54,282
Nice meeting you, Mr. Diamond.

2581
01:26:02,732 --> 01:26:03,892
Coach, look out!

2582
01:26:07,136 --> 01:26:08,262
They're not cops!

2583
01:26:13,743 --> 01:26:16,143
Hey, we're coming to America.

2584
01:26:21,284 --> 01:26:25,482
Dearly beloved, we are gathered here
today to join Darren Silverman...

2585
01:26:25,688 --> 01:26:29,021
...and Judith Fessbeggler
in holy matrimony.

2586
01:26:29,325 --> 01:26:32,260
If anyone has any objections,
speak now.

2587
01:26:32,528 --> 01:26:33,586
I do.

2588
01:26:33,796 --> 01:26:35,821
-What?
-Neil?

2589
01:26:41,437 --> 01:26:42,768
-Neil!
-Neil.

2590
01:26:42,972 --> 01:26:45,372
Get to the part where we say, "I do."

2591
01:27:08,397 --> 01:27:09,386
Oh, my!

2592
01:27:10,199 --> 01:27:12,030
-Say, "I do."
-No.

2593
01:27:12,468 --> 01:27:14,129
Say, "I do."

2594
01:27:14,370 --> 01:27:16,201
I can't. Because I...

2595
01:27:19,542 --> 01:27:21,533
...I love Neil...

2596
01:27:21,744 --> 01:27:23,541
...and I love Sandy.

2597
01:27:25,148 --> 01:27:26,809
You're in love with this slut?

2598
01:27:27,016 --> 01:27:29,143
I am not a slut.

2599
01:27:29,652 --> 01:27:31,984
Sandy is my one and only someone.

2600
01:27:45,568 --> 01:27:47,058
What about me?

2601
01:27:47,603 --> 01:27:50,163
Who's my someone?

2602
01:28:07,890 --> 01:28:09,755
You ruined my life!

2603
01:28:11,127 --> 01:28:12,560
But I saved Darren's!

2604
01:28:12,762 --> 01:28:15,959
Just because I lost Darren
doesn't mean I'm crazy enough...

2605
01:28:16,232 --> 01:28:17,631
...to hook up with you!

2606
01:28:23,406 --> 01:28:26,842
Why can't you just admit that
when you kissed me, you liked it?

2607
01:28:27,043 --> 01:28:30,137
You're right. I have a weakness
for incompetent morons.

2608
01:28:39,222 --> 01:28:40,780
Admit it!

2609
01:28:42,091 --> 01:28:45,390
I'm the strong-willed,
assertive man that you need...

2610
01:28:45,595 --> 01:28:49,554
...and you're the hard-core bitch
that I've always dreamed of.

2611
01:29:09,919 --> 01:29:10,908
What about you?

2612
01:29:11,754 --> 01:29:15,246
-When are you gonna get hitched?
-Actually, I'm not. I'm gay.

2613
01:29:16,425 --> 01:29:17,687
Me too.

2614
01:29:17,927 --> 01:29:19,155
Really?

2615
01:29:19,896 --> 01:29:22,694
By the power vested in me
by the state of Washington...

2616
01:29:22,899 --> 01:29:25,561
...I now pronounce you man and wife.

2617
01:29:25,768 --> 01:29:27,429
You may kiss the bride.

2618
01:29:30,273 --> 01:29:32,901
I now pronounce you man and wife.

2619
01:29:33,109 --> 01:29:35,043
You may kiss the bride.

2620
01:29:37,747 --> 01:29:41,239
I now pronounce you man and man.

2621
01:29:41,450 --> 01:29:43,384
You may kiss the man.

2622
01:30:05,474 --> 01:30:07,465
Come on, we need you for this one.
