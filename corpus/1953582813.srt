00:43:50,193 --> 00:43:51,128
Ignore him, Geoffrey.

761
00:43:51,161 --> 00:43:52,829
He means well, just forget sometimes

762
00:43:52,862 --> 00:43:55,232
he is not the only horse on the track.

763
00:43:56,166 --> 00:43:58,168
Yes, but do you trust him?

764
00:43:59,469 --> 00:44:01,672
I trust my staff.

766
00:44:05,108 --> 00:44:06,176

Si.

768
00:44:07,944 --> 00:44:09,146
Si.

769
00:44:09,179 --> 00:44:09,813
Mm-hmm.

770
00:44:09,846 --> 00:44:10,514
Danke.

771
00:44:10,547 --> 00:44:12,549
Danke schön.

772
00:44:14,918 --> 00:44:16,920

773
00:44:16,953 --> 00:44:17,854
No.

774
00:44:17,888 --> 00:44:19,923
As usual administrative problems.

775
00:44:19,956 --> 00:44:21,124
Our donors are very generous,

776
00:44:21,157 --> 00:44:23,326
that allow a good margin of discretion ...

777
00:44:23,359 --> 00:44:24,928
... But they are so impatient.

778
00:44:24,961 --> 00:44:26,396
And that's where I come in?

779
00:44:26,429 --> 00:44:27,631
You are an asset to our team, Geoffrey.

780
00:44:27,664 --> 00:44:29,833
I would not be here if it was.

781
00:44:29,866 --> 00:44:31,068
But I admit, I hope you're excited

782
00:44:31,101 --> 00:44:33,170
Jarek it has to show ...

783
00:44:33,203 --> 00:44:34,771
... Maybe even enough to give him the benefit

784
00:44:34,804 --> 00:44:35,739
of their experience.

785
00:44:35,772 --> 00:44:37,674
See, that's where I'm still confused.

786
00:44:37,707 --> 00:44:38,508
Sorry, but ... [Babbling]

787
00:44:38,541 --> 00:44:39,576
Are you asking me to collaborate

788
00:44:39,609 --> 00:44:41,044
with both Jarek and Rebekka?

789
00:44:41,077 --> 00:44:42,512
Well, that depends on you.

790
00:44:42,545 --> 00:44:44,681
I can not tell you to stop your own research,

791
00:44:44,714 --> 00:44:47,017
after all, I mean ... That's why we're here.

792
00:44:47,050 --> 00:44:48,251
But you must admit,

793
00:44:48,284 --> 00:44:51,088
This is a unique and singular.

794
00:44:51,121 --> 00:44:52,923
Look, I had the impression

795
00:44:52,956 --> 00:44:55,025
that this was the draft Rebekka,

796
00:44:55,058 --> 00:44:56,626
Easter the gene was ... its discovery.

797
00:44:56,659 --> 00:44:57,961

... Between you and me ..

803
00:45:07,070 --> 00:45:09,940
... This is a bit of a difficult situation.

804
00:45:09,973 --> 00:45:12,909
Rebekka has refused to cooperate with him further.

805
00:45:12,942 --> 00:45:13,777
Yes? Why is that?

806
00:45:13,810 --> 00:45:14,978
I do not know, but I can not

807
00:45:15,011 --> 00:45:18,014
cast him out of the project.

808
00:45:18,047 --> 00:45:19,416
So what are you working down there?

809
00:45:19,449 --> 00:45:21,051
I have what some genotyping ago ...

810
00:45:21,084 --> 00:45:22,719
... Retouching away, alone in the dark.

811
00:45:22,752 --> 00:45:23,920
It's what suits you.

814
00:45:26,956 --> 00:45:28,492

... Meet with him.

820
00:45:36,166 --> 00:45:38,335
I like to thaw, sometimes.

821
00:45:39,402 --> 00:45:41,772
Is there something wrong?

822
00:45:41,805 --> 00:45:43,507
No, no ... I'm ...

829
00:46:04,327 --> 00:46:06,730
we are like the yin and yang of mitosis.

830
00:46:06,763 --> 00:46:09,266
It works on the uncontrolled cellular proliferation, cancer ...

831

... Me, in perfect cell harmony.

832
00:46:14,838 --> 00:46:16,773
So what is the story of that kind Jarek?

833
00:46:16,806 --> 00:46:18,108
What do you mean? What about him?

834
00:46:18,141 --> 00:46:19,743
No.

835
00:46:19,776 --> 00:46:22,012
It just seems a bit reserved.

836
00:46:22,045 --> 00:46:23,480
It's a little weird.

837
00:46:23,513 --> 00:46:26,650
I do not know, Samuel thinks it's some kind of genius.

838
00:46:26,683 --> 00:46:28,618
And you?

839
00:46:28,651 --> 00:46:30,087
What do you mean?

844
00:46:44,634 --> 00:46:46,136
So what is really working?

845
00:46:46,169 --> 00:46:48,138
I do not know what he is working.

846
00:46:48,171 --> 00:46:49,439
Will not tell me.

847
00:46:49,472 --> 00:46:50,874
To be honest, I really do not care.

848
00:46:50,907 --> 00:46:52,976
Something to do with the gene for Easter, maybe.

849
00:46:53,009 --> 00:46:54,478

850
00:46:56,646 --> 00:46:58,548
Rebekka, Samuel said.

851
00:46:58,581 --> 00:47:00,217
- I told you? - The Easter gene ...

852
00:47:00,250 --> 00:47:01,952
... It was not just his discovery, right?

853
00:47:01,985 --> 00:47:04,321
- This is my discovery. - But not yours alone.

854
00:47:04,354 --> 00:47:06,390
I'm not a liar, Geoff.

855
00:47:07,223 --> 00:47:08,325
Look, I just want to know

856
00:47:08,358 --> 00:47:10,894
what you're getting into, here.

857
00:47:10,927 --> 00:47:12,495
You say that we are working together, well ...

858
00:47:12,528 --> 00:47:13,864
... But I do not even know who ...

859
00:47:13,897 --> 00:47:14,998
... Research is more.

860
00:47:15,031 --> 00:47:16,867
II do not even know who is involved.

861
00:47:16,900 --> 00:47:18,668
Jarek is not involved in what I'm doing.

862
00:47:18,701 --> 00:47:19,970
- You've done the work with him. - Only a short ...

863
00:47:20,003 --> 00:47:21,538
... In the early stages.

864
00:47:21,571 --> 00:47:23,607
I do not like his style. He was too reckless.

865
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:25,876
Tried to master my project.

866
00:47:25,909 --> 00:47:26,676
He threatened to quit

867
00:47:26,709 --> 00:47:28,411
if Samuel did not take off.

868
00:47:28,444 --> 00:47:29,713
In the end, I won.

869
00:47:29,746 --> 00:47:31,348
Well, according to Samuel, who is still in it.

870
00:47:31,381 --> 00:47:33,550
Is cosmetics.

871
00:47:42,292 --> 00:47:44,695

872
00:47:48,464 --> 00:47:50,500
- Where did you get that? - I recovered ...

873
00:47:50,533 --> 00:47:53,069
... In the house mouse, and I suggest you change the locks.

874
00:47:53,102 --> 00:47:54,203
What do you mean?

875
00:47:54,237 --> 00:47:56,706
Jarek has a clandestine laboratory setting, and I ...

876
00:47:56,739 --> 00:47:58,942
... Yeah, I'm pretty damn sure you're testing the gene Easter

- I'll take care of it. - What?

880
00:48:08,384 --> 00:48:10,253
- I'll talk to Samuel. - Why? Why not ...

881
00:48:10,286 --> 00:48:12,689
- ... Just face ... - It will not help.

882
00:48:14,190 --> 00:48:15,225

You were very ...

1504
01:33:59,766 --> 01:34:02,670
... Restless, in these last days.

1505
01:34:02,703 --> 01:34:04,538
But do not worry.

1506
01:34:04,571 --> 01:34:07,908
Everything is being thoroughly investigated.

Geoffrey ...

1508
01:34:12,646 --> 01:34:15,349
... That has been very ill.

1509
01:34:15,382 --> 01:34:17,985
But, you're all better.

1510
01:34:18,018 --> 01:34:20,788
His recovery has been remarkable ...

1511
01:34:20,821 --> 01:34:22,790
... Inspiring, in fact.

1512
01:34:24,191 --> 01:34:26,861
Do you remember anything?

1513
01:34:28,195 --> 01:34:29,530
Where is she?

1514
01:34:29,563 --> 01:34:31,231
She is here.

1515
01:34:31,264 --> 01:34:33,234
Look ...

01:34:42,042 --> 01:34:44,144
Listen, buddy ...

1520
01:34:44,177 --> 01:34:48,215
... We're going to have to stay here a bit.

1521
01:34:48,248 --> 01:34:50,284
You are unique, you see ...

1522
01:34:51,585 --> 01:34:56,390
... But just for the moment, you are a bit of a danger to himself.

1523
01:34:56,423 --> 01:34:58,726
Now, do not worry ...

1524
01:34:58,759 --> 01:35:00,628

Hey, you.

1530
01:35:42,736 --> 01:35:44,438
You were very sick ...

1531
01:35:44,471 --> 01:35:45,873
... But you're good now.

1532
01:35:47,207 --> 01:35:48,843
You are immune.

1533
01:35:51,545 --> 01:35:53,514
Look at this.

1534
01:35:56,049 --> 01:35:57,685
You see that?

Jarek was right.

Burton Syndrome is actually a latent retrovirus.

We all do.

1539
01:36:14,134 --> 01:36:16,703
It is millions of years old.

1540
01:36:16,736 --> 01:36:19,807
Only his son was a very special version of her ...

1541
01:36:19,840 --> 01:36:21,742
... Now.

1542
01:36:23,710 --> 01:36:25,312
You are a miracle.

1543
01:36:26,746 --> 01:36:29,517
And his son was a miracle.
