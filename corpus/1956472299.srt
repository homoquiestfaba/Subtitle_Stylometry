1
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:37,400
Amazing!

2
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:39,400
Nitrogen 7/8.

3
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:40,800
Oxygen, 21.2.

4
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:43,000
Better than back on Earth.

5
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,600
Alright, we're heading north.

6
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:48,200
Single file, stay alert.

7
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,000
Harling!

8
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:27,600
Harling!

9
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:31,600
Harling!

10
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:39,000
Sir, I'm sorry, I didn't see you!

11
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:46,800
Holy!

12
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,200
What the?

13
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,600
Keira!

14
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,600
We're coming down!

15
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,000
Rioting over access

16
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,200
to vaccination has
caused the Prime Minister

17
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:02,600
of the World Congress to
declare a quarantine of Africa,

18
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:05,400
suspending all travel to
and from the continent.

19
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,400
The Mexican government has announced

20
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,800
that the death toll has now reached 40,000

21
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:13,600
in Mexico due to the air pollution crisis.

22
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,800
Residents are warned not to go outside

23
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:18,200
without proper breathing apparatus.

24
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:20,800
In related news, a gas mask shortage

25
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:23,600
in Mexico City has triggered
looting with hundreds

26
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,800
of civilians being shot by police.

27
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,800
Today marks the 10th anniversary

28
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,400
of the India-Pakistan nuclear war of 2058.

29
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,800
Scientists have determined
the continuing death toll

30
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:39,200
from the radioactive fallout
has reached over one billion.

31
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:41,200
Latest calculations suggest the region

32
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:45,400
will be uninhabitable for
at least another 200 years.

33
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,800
It's no damn picnic here, either.

34
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,400
Calron has completed its takeover

35
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,400
of Microsphere making
Calron the largest privately

36
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,800
held company in the world.

37
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:54,400
And its majority
shareholder, James Carlson,

38
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,000
the richest man--
- Radio off.

39
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:00,600
Go away, Duncan.

40
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,200
How fast can you get here?

41
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,800
You have any idea what today is?

42
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,000
What?

43
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,800
It's the first day of my vacation.

44
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:11,800
Canceled.

45
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:14,000
Word came down from high up.

46
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Carlson?

47
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,200
The man himself.

48
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,000
See you soon.

49
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,200
Morning.

50
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:37,600
There's a communique for me, Randall Cain.

51
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,400
Thank you.

52
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,800
John, Vickers, good morning, gentlemen.

53
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,600
- Hey, boss.
- How you doing, boss?

54
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,200
Check it out, finally arrived.

55
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,400
Valdez 4400.

56
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,200
That's my little baby right here.

57
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,200
Yeah, well, I think I'm
gonna stick with this.

58
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:05,800
It might be an antique, but
it doesn't take any batteries.

59
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:06,800
Can you believe it?

60
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:07,800
The first day off in months.

61
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,800
I was gonna try and
unwind and have some fun.

62
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:10,600
Yeah, weren't we all?

63
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,200
Weren't you are gonna go off to Vegas,

64
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,600
spend some time with what's-her-name,

65
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,000
that sexy brunette?
- Yeah, well, what's-her-name

66
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,400
went to Vegas on her own.

67
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,000
Said I was too isshy.

68
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:18,800
Isshy?

69
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,800
Said living with a foreign
military man was, uh.

70
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:22,800
You know what?

71
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,200
It doesn't matter, let's go upstairs.

72
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:26,000
She wanted a nine to fiver, anyway.

73
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,200
Let's introduce her to Duncan.

74
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,400
What's he want with us anyways?

75
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,400
It's not Duncan, it's Carlson.

76
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:32,400
The man himself.

77
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,200
It's the real deal,
gentlemen, Project Ark.

78
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:37,000
I thought that belonged
to Harling's team?

79
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:37,800
What happened to Harling?

80
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,600
Oh, he probably
got another migraine.

81
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,600
You know, cold, hangnail,
something like that.

82
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,200
He might be on
vacation, for all I know.

83
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:47,200
Tight lid on this one,
strictly a need-to-know.

84
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,800
Whatever, I
just hope we get to kick

85
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,000
some ass because I want some fun.

86
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
The day
you learn to have some fun

87
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I'll be the happiest man on this planet.

88
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:05,800
Cain, nice of you to join us.

89
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,600
Mr. Carlson has asked me to bring you

90
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,400
all up to speed before he arrives.

91
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,400
Okay, Duncan, everybody's
bottled up nice and secure.

92
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,400
What's the big secret?

93
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:27,600
As you're well aware
our planet is dying.

94
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,800
The Earth's resources have
been depleted beyond repair.

95
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,600
If there's going to be a future

96
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:35,600
for the human race it
will not be here on Earth.

97
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,600
All the major global
corporations are throwing

98
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:40,400
in their resources for
off-planet solutions.

99
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,200
GSA's building huge ships.

100
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:45,800
Alcor has purchased exclusive
rights to colonize the moon.

101
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:49,600
And, as usual, our Mr. Carlson
has aimed a little higher.

102
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:52,200
Given Mr. Carlson's roots in
aviation and space travel,

103
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:54,800
he's come up with a solution
that could save billions

104
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,400
of lives and generate billions of profits.

105
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,600
If we can get it to work.

106
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:04,400
The Oxygen
Project, what is that?

107
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,000
What I'm about to tell you

108
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,400
is known by less than a dozen people.

109
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,000
50 years ago NASA located planets

110
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,200
with characteristics similar to

111
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:16,600
the Earth's size, gravity
and magnetic field.

112
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,200
The planet we have labeled Oxygen

113
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:20,800
has the raw DNA of plant and animal life

114
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,600
that would make it possible
to create a single plant

115
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:26,600
capable of producing
mass amounts of oxygen.

116
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:31,800
All the other corporations
are focusing on Project Ark.

117
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,600
We're going ahead with Project Oxygen.

118
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,000
So, what you're saying
is you've discovered

119
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,800
a plant that can produce as much

120
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:40,800
oxygen as the rainforest used to?

121
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:41,600
Exactly!

122
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,600
It would take light years just

123
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,400
to send DNA through space which is one

124
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,600
of the reasons NASA abandoned the project.

125
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,000
Not to mention the thousands of years

126
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,400
it would take these planets to develop.

127
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:54,600
Make that millions of years.

128
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:58,000
Oxygen is our new precious commodity.

129
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,800
Our discovery will save
mankind from extinction.

130
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:04,800
Allison, welcome to the party, love.

131
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,200
You told them the part about
the advancement in technology?

132
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,200
Well, I was actually just--

133
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:10,600
What technology is that?

134
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,000
The very heart of the Oxygen Project,

135
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,800
the one and only thing
that can make it possible;

136
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:17,800
DST, Deep Space Teleportation.

137
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,400
You're joking?

138
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,000
I don't joke about business.

139
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:27,600
DST, discovered by the late
Chinese physicist, Yan Pow,

140
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,200
secretly purchased and
perfected by yours truly.

141
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,400
It requires massive amounts of energy

142
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:36,000
and it only works at
extremely long distances.

143
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,800
Which, luckily, for our purposes,

144
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:41,000
makes it ideal for this very project.

145
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:43,600
30 years ago.

146
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Here it is today.

147
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,600
Not very impressive, I know.

148
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:54,000
Project 2, Project 3 and Project 4.

149
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Each planet, same result,
all but one, Oxygen One.

150
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,400
Here it is 30 years ago
and here it is today.

151
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,600
How is that possible?

152
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,400
That's the trillion
dollar question, isn't it?

153
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:11,200
Duncan headed up the surface
teleportation project.

154
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,200
The results were mixed.

155
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,000
Duncan?

156
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:19,000
DST technology is still
relatively primitive.

157
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,200
It took us years just
to successfully teleport

158
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,800
a Unibot to Plant Oxygen's surface.

159
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,800
This disc was teleported back to us.

160
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,400
Now, this is what the bot recorded.

161
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:44,600
Planet Oxygen has 99.9%
Earth's atmosphere,

162
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,400
a wide variety of vegetation similar

163
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:48,000
to species found here on Earth

164
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,200
and abundant clean and
clear water sources.

165
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,800
Are there any mammals,
any other signs of life?

166
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:56,400
Sensors indicate nothing dangerous.

167
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:58,000
I would think that the biggest thing

168
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,600
we're gonna run into is probably rabbits.

169
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,800
Launch is set for 02:30 tomorrow.

170
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,800
Cain and his team will provide security.

171
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,800
Myself, Duncan and Allison
are the science team.

172
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:10,400
Gretchen will provide medical support.

173
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:12,400
My lawyer, Mr. Mason, will make sure that

174
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:16,000
the possession of this planet
and its resources are legal.

175
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,600
And Miss Bertzyk will officially

176
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,200
record the event for posterity.

177
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,600
What, no marching bands?

178
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,400
Maybe on the next one.

179
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:26,400
Any other questions?

180
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,600
Yeah, one.

181
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,600
What's the objective?

182
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:36,200
Explore Oxygen and find
and secure this unique plant.

183
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:38,200
This is lightning in a bottle, people.

184
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,400
We are on the verge of the most

185
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:42,200
important discovery in human history.

186
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:45,200
Well, for those who can afford it.

187
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,000
Right?

188
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:49,400
What's his job, hairdresser?

189
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,600
I'm tagging along in case you need help.

190
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:57,400
Mr. Alvarez is responsible
for my personal security.

191
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,600
I thought my team was
in charge of security?

192
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,600
My world, my rules.

193
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,400
End of story.

194
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,800
Well, we'll see you all at launch.

195
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,400
Let's make history, everyone.

196
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:13,200
I'll need DNA from everyone by noon.

197
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,000
Sure.

198
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,400
Those are full of aluminum.

199
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:20,400
I'm gonna write you a prescription

200
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:23,200
for something a little
easier on your stomach.

201
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,200
- Oh, thank you.
- Sure.

202
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:31,600
Allison.

203
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,400
- Thank you.
- Sure.

204
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:41,200
Thanks.

205
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,600
Duncan?

206
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,400
Thank you for including me in this.

207
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:54,200
I know it must have been a
pretty tough sell to James.

208
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:55,800
Not really.

209
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,600
We need a biologist, you're the best.

210
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,400
Besides, he was eager for a chance

211
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:02,800
to spend some time with you.

212
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:06,000
I know how he feels.

213
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:09,600
That was in the past.

214
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,200
I'm on this mission because it's

215
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:14,000
an incredible opportunity, but that's all.

216
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:17,400
Yeah, well my door's always open

217
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:19,000
if you ever want to walk back in.

218
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:23,800
Tell me something.

219
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:24,600
Why do you even need DNA?

220
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:30,400
Well, a computer
copies our DNA to a disc,

221
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:32,600
then when atmospheric
conditions, thank you,

222
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:35,400
are perfect, we pinpoint a black hole

223
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,000
and we shoot the genetic code to

224
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,200
a receiver hub that's already been

225
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:40,600
teleported to the destination planet.

226
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:44,600
There are two discs; one
to go, one to come back.

227
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:46,400
Do not lose those discs.

228
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:50,200
Without the DNA we'd be torn to pieces.

229
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,800
So why can't you just use saliva?

230
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,400
Danger of contamination.

231
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:02,000
You wouldn't want to mix your genetic code

232
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,600
with something you ate for
breakfast, now, would you?

233
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:08,000
No, especially since I eat
guys like you for breakfast.

234
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:23,400
What happened to the first team?

235
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:25,200
What are you talking about?

236
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,200
James and I may be separated,

237
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:28,600
but I still know him pretty well.

238
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:30,000
And one thing I know for certain

239
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,400
is that he would not risk his life unless

240
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:36,200
he was absolutely sure
that the DST worked.

241
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,600
So there must have been another team

242
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,000
that went through first.

243
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,200
What happened to that team, Duncan?

244
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:46,600
Okay, let's say there was another team.

245
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Obviously, the
teleportation was successful

246
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,800
or James wouldn't risk it, would he?

247
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:55,400
There's nothing to be afraid of.

248
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:59,200
Where'd you learn that logic?

249
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,600
Physics or business school?

250
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,600
Do your worst.

251
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,600
Just relax.

252
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:10,800
You know, you can take
blood from me any day.

253
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:13,000
This should be sufficient, Mr. Stotzer.

254
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
No, no, no, John.

255
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,400
You call me John.

256
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:17,600
John.

257
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,000
You know with me on this trip you'll be

258
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,200
as safe as a babe in
ever lovin' mama's arms.

259
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,800
I think I feel safer already.

260
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,200
Gum?

261
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,200
Gum?

262
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,400
Biodegradable.

263
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:30,200
Maybe later.

264
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,000
Having fun?

265
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,800
Dunc, between you and me and the wall,

266
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:41,600
what's up with Harling?

267
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,800
I'm sorry, what was that?

268
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:49,200
Come on, this was his project.

269
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,200
Wondering what you reassigned him to.

270
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:57,400
What's it matter, Cain, you jealous?

271
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:01,200
Yeah, yeah, that must be it.

272
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:25,200
Sorry, Mrs. Carlson,
didn't mean to startle you.

273
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:28,800
I don't startle easily and it's doctor.

274
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:35,800
What, uh, what're you looking at?

275
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:39,000
I don't know.

276
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:43,400
It's just this last bit
of static that bothers me.

277
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:45,400
Is there a glitch?

278
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:48,200
There's a technical
glitch, it just cut out.

279
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:50,000
There shouldn't be any static.

280
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,800
I've been trying to
access the backup files,

281
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:53,800
except for no luck.

282
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:59,000
Maybe I'm just being paranoid.

283
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,600
It's just a bad case of the nerves.

284
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:05,800
Nervous, about being teleported
20,000 light years away?

285
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:09,000
I'm still trying to wrap
my head around that one.

286
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:12,000
20,000 light years.

287
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,200
The very idea just staggers the mind.

288
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:18,600
We are only human.

289
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:20,600
We are none of us machines.

290
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:22,200
It's okay to be afraid.

291
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,400
It's what keeps us alive.

292
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:27,400
Cain?

293
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:42,800
The first transmission?

294
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:48,600
Rations, supplies,
weapons and video equipment.

295
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:51,200
All readings indicate they
made it safe and sound.

296
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:55,600
I've sent a temporary
receiving hub for myself.

297
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:58,000
I'll set up a permanent
hub when I arrive safely.

298
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
I'll let you know by sending a signal.

299
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,200
When I do that's the all-clear
to start coming through

300
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,000
one at a time, in the assigned order.

301
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:10,000
No signal, no one comes through.

302
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,200
Clear?

303
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,800
Okay.

304
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:15,200
We got our atmospheric window.

305
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,000
It's time.

306
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:21,600
Countdown will start from
five when I hit the launchpad.

307
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Good luck.

308
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,800
See you on the other side.

309
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,000
In five, four,

310
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:40,000
three, two, one.

311
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,400
Randall Cain.

312
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:50,600
When I signed on they
said there'd be travel.

313
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:53,400
Three, two, one.

314
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:02,800
How you feeling?

315
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,800
Like a sock that just went
through the tumble dryer.

316
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:09,600
Give it a sec, you'll feel great.

317
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,400
Obviously, we can breathe this stuff.

318
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:13,600
Yeah, we're acclimated to much worse.

319
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,600
This all the supplies?

320
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:18,600
Carry-ons may shift during flight.

321
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:20,200
Yeah, obviously.

322
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,000
Damn!

323
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:32,800
Welcome.

324
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,000
How do I look?

325
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,200
You're still ugly.

326
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,400
In five, four, three,

327
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:06,400
two, one.

328
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:25,800
Allison Carlson.

329
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:33,800
In five, four, three,

330
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:38,800
two, one.

331
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,200
In five, four, three,

332
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:05,200
two, one.

333
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:15,600
In five, four, three,

334
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:21,600
two, one.

335
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:36,400
Alvarez!

336
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,800
There's a blip
in the teleporter device!

337
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,200
Help me straighten him out!

338
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:44,000
Don't touch
him, don't touch him!

339
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
What the hell happened here?

340
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,800
Bone deterioration, his
torso structure is gone.

341
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:48,600
It's gone!

342
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:49,800
What do you mean gone?

343
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:51,400
It just didn't make it through!

344
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,400
What was that?

345
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:58,800
My PDA's gone down.

346
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:00,600
Alright, talk to me, Duncan.

347
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:03,400
Too much stress on the system.

348
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:06,000
I warned you about this!

349
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,400
Alright, what does this mean?

350
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:09,600
Where does this leave us?

351
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:16,200
Well, it means we're on our own.

352
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:33,400
Jesus, what the hell just happened?

353
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:34,200
Stotzer!

354
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:37,400
Our only mode of transport back to Earth

355
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:38,600
just turned that guy into hamburger.

356
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:40,400
How the hell are we gonna get home?

357
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:44,600
Obviously, his DNA and the
transporter did a disconnect.

358
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,600
Now, it's a terrible tragedy, I'm sorry.

359
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:50,400
But every experiment has its downside.

360
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:51,400
I'll fix this.

361
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:52,200
You have my word on it.

362
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:53,600
Yeah, that's great.

363
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,600
That fills me with a
whole lot of confidence.

364
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:58,600
Alright, alright, we all agree
this is a terrible tragedy.

365
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:01,200
But let's not forget
what we came here for.

366
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,600
We are currently the first human beings

367
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:04,200
to set foot on this planet.

368
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:05,800
Prioritize, people.

369
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:08,200
Opportunities like this
don't come along every day.

370
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:12,000
So let's just stay focused on our jobs.

371
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
He's right.

372
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
We're here, we should make the best of it.

373
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:21,400
We're stranded here, aren't we?

374
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:23,200
Nobody's stranded, darlin'.

375
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:25,600
It's just a little technical
glitch, that's all.

376
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,800
You call that a technical glitch?

377
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,600
It's nothing Duncan can't fix.

378
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:32,600
Isn't that right?

379
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:35,800
It'll take time.

380
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:40,200
Yeah!

381
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:44,600
Here she is.

382
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Yo, James!

383
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:51,000
Business calls.

384
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:59,000
The camera's working perfectly.

385
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:02,400
Alright, let's get set up.

386
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:04,800
You ready?

387
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:15,000
It's the most state of the art camera

388
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,800
on the market and nobody else has one.

389
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:19,200
It's a thousand to one zoom.

390
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,400
Let's do this.

391
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:32,800
You ready?

392
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:34,400
We are rollin'.

393
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:38,000
I'm James Carlson.

394
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
I'm currently standing on Project Oxygen

395
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,800
breathing pure, clean air.

396
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:45,600
Project Oxygen is an unexplored planet

397
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:48,000
20,000 light years from Earth.

398
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,800
How I arrived here and the purpose of

399
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:53,000
this journey will be revealed in due time.

400
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,200
But to more immediate business purposes,

401
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:58,200
I hereby claim Project Oxygen as

402
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:00,800
the sole property of Calron Corporation.

403
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:02,600
My witness.

404
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:06,000
Carter Mason, attorney at law.

405
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,600
Do not assume that
what you see around me

406
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,600
is merely another corporate venture.

407
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:16,800
This pristine, unspoiled world represents

408
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:19,400
a new beginning for each
and every citizen of Earth.

409
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:23,000
God bless you, God bless us all.

410
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,000
That's it.

411
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:29,400
That sincere?
- Yes.

412
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:31,000
- Sincere?
- I'd trust you.

413
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,600
- Alright, let's go.
- Excellent.

414
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:43,000
Most of the gear made it through.

415
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:43,800
What do you mean most?

416
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:45,400
My 4400's toast, man.

417
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:49,600
Two cases of weapons and electronics

418
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:52,200
are missing and there's only two cylinders

419
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:54,200
for the Magnum, one for the rifle.

420
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:58,400
Two cylinders, six shots
each, for the Magnum.

421
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:00,600
One, two, three, four, five, six.

422
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:01,600
Seven shots for the Winchester.

423
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:04,400
Well, we'll make do.

424
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:06,200
Vickers and I, 12 each.

425
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:10,000
We gotta find shelter to
make camp for the night.

426
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,600
Stotz, take point this direction, will ya?

427
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:13,200
On it!

428
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:15,800
Where you headed?

429
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:16,800
I'm taking the point, too.

430
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:20,400
This is a brand new planet
and I'm a scientist, remember?

431
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,400
You don't leave Stotz's side.

432
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:24,800
Okay.

433
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,200
Nutrition, housing, A-okay.

434
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:34,800
Alright, guys, grab as much cargo

435
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:36,400
as you can hold and let's roll.

436
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,600
We're already down a man
so you gotta carry extra.

437
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:43,200
I'm a lawyer, not a pack mule.

438
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,200
Yeah, well now's your chance

439
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:46,000
to move up in the world, counselor.

440
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,200
There's nothing you could do.

441
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,400
You know that, right?

442
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:57,800
I'm the medical officer.

443
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:59,000
I'm responsible for the life of

444
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,800
every person on this expedition.

445
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:03,600
Well, you didn't design the teleporter.

446
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:06,400
It was on my watch,
that's all that matters.

447
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:09,400
Your line of work, I think
you can understand that.

448
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:16,000
Alright, let's move.

449
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:53,000
This is amazing.

450
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:58,800
Mature vegetation, clean water, pure air.

451
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:00,000
That's what Earth must have been like

452
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,400
before man came along
and messed things up.

453
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:25,800
Ain't it great to
breathe without a mask?

454
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:26,600
Yeah.

455
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:28,400
This place is pretty much paradise.

456
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:45,600
What is it, what happened?

457
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:46,800
I was trailing behind you guys

458
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:48,800
and I saw something
huge, it was an animal!

459
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:50,400
Yeah, it must have been big.

460
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:52,200
And it's damn hungry, too.

461
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:56,800
Looks like we've made
contact with something.

462
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:58,800
Yeah, the question is, with what?

463
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:00,000
Alright, let's get outta here.

464
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,800
Everybody stick together, go, move!

465
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:11,400
Gretchen,
what did it look like?

466
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:13,000
I don't know.

467
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,200
It was huge, covered in fur.

468
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:15,800
I've never seen anything like it.

469
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:19,400
Everything just happened so quickly.

470
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:22,400
It grabbed the body and
just dragged it away.

471
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:56,200
What the hell is that?

472
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:02,600
Something sure did a number on it.

473
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:04,400
You mean that mother lost the fight?

474
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:31,400
2.49 meters, crown to toe.

475
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:32,400
That's a big guy.

476
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:33,200
Yeah.

477
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:37,600
Weight, I estimate about 270 kilograms.

478
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:39,600
Oh, my God.

479
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:41,000
What?

480
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,200
This claw.

481
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:44,200
The posterior end is soft.

482
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:45,000
What does that mean?

483
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:48,200
It means that this is a very young bear.

484
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:51,600
You're telling me this thing's a baby?

485
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:53,800
I'm just as shocked as you.

486
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:56,400
It's DNA must have undergone some

487
00:32:56,400 --> 00:33:00,400
kind of radical biochemical amplification

488
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:02,400
including extraordinary growth.

489
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:04,200
So what are we dealing with?

490
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:09,200
Well, I'm not certain, but
my guess is Ursus spelaeus.

491
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:12,200
It's a prehistoric cave bear.

492
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:14,800
It's been extinct on Earth
for over 10,000 years.

493
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:17,400
Bear?

494
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:18,600
No, this is a monster.

495
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:23,000
It was the most formidable
predator in its day.

496
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,800
So how does an extinct bear
come to get on this planet?

497
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:30,400
Somehow its DNA sequence regressed.

498
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:32,800
No modern bear, even full-grown,

499
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:35,800
has claws this big or a hide this dense.

500
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:40,400
The beast that did this stands 4.5 meters

501
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:42,600
and over 900 kilograms.

502
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:43,800
That's perfect.

503
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:44,800
So what else?

504
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:47,200
They're fast, they're tough.

505
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:50,800
They're very smart, lived
and hunted in packs.

506
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:53,400
Their only known enemy was man.

507
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:55,400
Over 100,000 years ago
our two species were put

508
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:57,800
into direct conflict
over food and territory.

509
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,200
Man won.

510
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:01,600
Yeah?

511
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,400
Well, I'm not a betting man,

512
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:05,800
but I don't like our chances in a rematch.

513
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:08,200
It's one bear, it's dead.

514
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:09,000
End of story.

515
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:13,800
We proceed as planned.

516
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:14,800
Whatever killed this is still

517
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:16,400
out there so we gotta be careful.

518
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:19,000
That's why you're here, isn't it?

519
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:22,600
Good work, trapped on a piece

520
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:24,400
of rock 20,000 light years from home

521
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:26,400
with carnivores bigger
than my company car.

522
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:28,200
Duncan'll fix the transporter.

523
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:30,800
You do your job and
keep us alive till then.

524
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,200
Alright?

525
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:33,000
That's gonna be a bit tough

526
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:36,200
with limited ordinance, don't you think?

527
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:10,000
Okay, as security officer I'm exercising

528
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
my authority to abort this expedition.

529
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:14,400
Fine with me.

530
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:15,800
I don't wanna suddenly find myself

531
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:17,600
on the bottom of the food chain.

532
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:19,200
Well, we're not going anywhere

533
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:20,800
without a working teleport hub.

534
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:22,200
What happened to the backup?

535
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:24,800
Obviously, it didn't teleport over.

536
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,200
Yeah.

537
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:28,800
Well, that should make
Mr. Carlson pretty happy.

538
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:34,000
You think I willingly stranded myself

539
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,200
on an alien planet with these prehistoric,

540
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:38,600
man-eating bears on it?

541
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:40,400
I think you like your job,

542
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:42,000
and I think you'd do just about

543
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,200
whatever it takes to keep it.

544
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:46,600
What's going on?

545
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:50,400
Expedition's aborted,
it's too dangerous.

546
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:54,000
James, you know that no one wants

547
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
to find that oxygen planet more than me,

548
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,400
but I think that Cain is right.

549
00:35:58,400 --> 00:35:59,600
We're all in danger here.

550
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:03,200
We have to fix that
hub and get outta here.

551
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:07,000
Listen, Allison, when I want
your opinion I'll ask for it.

552
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:09,400
This isn't some university lecture hall

553
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:10,600
full of drunken students.

554
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:13,600
We're on an alien planet;

555
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:15,200
of course, it's bloody dangerous!

556
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:17,400
Every mission of great discovery

557
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:19,600
is full of danger, and
yeah, sometimes death.

558
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:21,800
But those who die, they go down

559
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:24,000
in history as explorers and heroes.

560
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:27,200
We cheapen their deaths
by acting like cowards.

561
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,600
You can talk so causally about death

562
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:34,800
and yet you know absolutely
nothing about life.

563
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:38,400
This mission is too
important to stop now.

564
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:43,200
We're discovering a new planet
and a new hope for mankind!

565
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:45,200
Just can the speeches, will ya?

566
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,400
You wanna fire me when
we get back, that's fine.

567
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:50,000
But out here the contract says that I'm

568
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,600
in charge of all matters relating to

569
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:53,600
the security and the safety of the team.

570
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:54,600
So, it's my decision.

571
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,000
And I say we're gonna cut our losses

572
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,800
and we're gonna teleport off

573
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,600
this rock the first chance we get.

574
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:03,200
Who do you think you're speaking to?

575
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:04,600
You work for me, damn it!

576
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:07,200
Yeah, so get the hell out of
my way and let me do my job.

577
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:11,000
Hey, I found it!

578
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:14,800
I found the backup hub!

579
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:18,200
It must have transported
to the wrong coordinates.

580
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,800
It's way, way, north of here.

581
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,400
I can find it.

582
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:26,800
Just give me some time, I'll find it.

583
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:29,800
About time something
on this planet worked.

584
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:31,800
Alright, we move out at first light.

585
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:35,800
We gotta get to that hub before sunset.

586
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,400
Then we go home.

587
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:41,600
Sounds good.

588
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:54,000
James is, um, just always James.

589
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:57,600
Like winter is cold or like the moon

590
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:59,400
is made of lifeless rock.

591
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:00,200
Yeah.

592
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:03,000
Well, there must have been something

593
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:06,600
about him at one point in time, right?

594
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:08,600
Yeah, he really believed in me.

595
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:13,600
He supported my projects,
but he's changed.

596
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,800
I used to think he was so smart.

597
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:21,400
Well, he can't be that smart

598
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:24,200
if he's not paying attention
to a girl like you.

599
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:25,200
It's a lonely planet.

600
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:39,000
This should take you right to it.

601
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
Remember to turn the beacon off when

602
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,200
you get there and wait
for me to contact you.

603
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:44,800
Only me.

604
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:48,000
I don't need the others knowing
the reason why we came here.

605
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:48,800
One problem.

606
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:51,400
What if I run into one of
those things out there?

607
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:53,600
I don't pay
you to ask questions.

608
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:55,800
No, correction, you don't pay me enough.

609
00:38:58,400 --> 00:38:59,600
I'll double your fee.

610
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:00,600
Not enough.

611
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:05,000
I want ownership, 5%
and you double my fee.

612
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,600
I don't like greedy employees, Bertzyk.

613
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:11,400
Not employee, partner.

614
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:15,200
That's what it'll cost
you, take it or leave it.

615
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,400
Fine, now go.

616
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:30,600
I'm gonna need a weapon.

617
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:33,600
You even know how to use one?

618
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:35,200
I'm not going without a weapon.

619
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:48,800
Great, guess I'll go check out our planet.

620
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:08,400
Say, Duncan, let me ask you a question.

621
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:12,000
The weapons are missing,
teleporter doesn't work,

622
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,600
replacement hub ends up some kilometers

623
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:15,000
away from our position.

624
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:17,600
Can you explain that to me?

625
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:22,200
It's like I told you before,
the technology's primitive--

626
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:23,000
Oh, come on!

627
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,600
Carlson's not an idiot.

628
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:27,800
Wouldn't risk his life on a
teleporter that didn't work.

629
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:30,000
So that only leaves one
other possible explanation

630
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,200
for why everything's getting
screwed up, doesn't it?

631
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:35,000
You're insinuating I--

632
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,200
I'm not insinuating anything.

633
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:39,600
I'm standing right in front
of you and I'm accusing you.

634
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:41,400
I don't trust you, Duncan.

635
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:42,800
I don't think you're nearly

636
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:44,400
as incompetent as you pretend to be.

637
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:47,000
You need to get that damn hub working.

638
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:50,800
And if any other mysterious
problem presents itself,

639
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:52,600
then I'm gonna come straight to

640
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:53,600
the source and I'm gonna eliminate it.

641
00:40:57,800 --> 00:40:59,600
You're threatening me?

642
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:03,600
No, no, you have my word on it.

643
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:04,800
It's a promise.

644
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:25,200
No!

645
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:26,000
No!

646
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:29,000
No!

647
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:36,000
Vick, what the hell was that?

648
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:42,400
Where's Bertzyk?

649
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:43,200
James!

650
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:49,800
No!

651
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:51,400
James!

652
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:52,200
James!

653
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:04,400
No!

654
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, Lord!

655
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:37,000
I'm so sorry about Bertzyk.

656
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:41,400
I know that she was a friend of yours.

657
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:44,600
Yeah, she was always loyal to me.

658
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:48,400
What was she doing out
there all on her own?

659
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:51,000
It's hard to say.

660
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,800
I guess she probably let
curiosity get the better of her.

661
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:03,000
James, I think that we should talk.

662
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:06,800
As far as I'm concerned, we
have nothing to talk about.

663
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:08,600
So that's it?

664
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:10,400
There's no discussion?

665
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,000
All this time.

666
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:18,000
Did you ever, ever care about me?

667
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:21,400
You know what I care about?

668
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:24,800
I care about people who stand
by me, no questions asked.

669
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,400
Especially when the chips are down.

670
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:29,200
Right.

671
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:32,600
So all that talk about--

672
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:38,000
What the hell?

673
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:54,000
Bastard.

674
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:12,800
Where's Duncan?

675
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:13,600
I can't find him.

676
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:15,800
He was here last night.

677
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:17,200
Have you checked the radio?

678
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:18,600
No answer.

679
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:19,400
All his things are gone

680
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:21,400
and the circuit board
of the hub is missing.

681
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:24,000
Cain, I don't like these readings.

682
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,200
I think this quake was just the first.

683
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:28,400
There's a major seismic shift occurring.

684
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:30,600
The planet is experiencing eons of change

685
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:32,000
at a hyper-accelerated rate.

686
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:35,200
The entire surface of
the planet is in flux.

687
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:37,200
It's literally ripping itself apart.

688
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:38,000
Okay, how long?

689
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:39,800
There's no way to know for sure.

690
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:40,600
Any idea?

691
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:42,200
Hours, days.

692
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:44,400
Alright, we gotta find
Duncan before he finds the hub.

693
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:46,600
He's way ahead of us by now.

694
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:50,800
Alright, Mason, Carlson,
Allison, you're gonna go with me.

695
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:52,000
We're gonna hit the valley.

696
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
The rest of you pack
up and take the bluff.

697
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:54,800
Well.

698
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:56,200
Radio contact at all times.

699
00:45:56,200 --> 00:45:57,000
What if we find Duncan?

700
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:58,400
I'll deal with him.

701
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:17,200
Try to keep up.

702
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:28,600
These aftershocks are
getting closer together.

703
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:29,800
We gotta hurry.

704
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:32,600
I need to rest!

705
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:33,600
There's no time.

706
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:35,600
Move your ass, Mason!

707
00:46:35,600 --> 00:46:37,200
You're endangering all of us!

708
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:39,000
I need to rest!

709
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:54,200
Come on, Mason, just
breathe, but you gotta hurry.

710
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:56,000
- I know.
- We gotta go.

711
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:01,000
Come on, give it a try.

712
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:02,600
Okay?

713
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:04,800
Allison, come up
here and check this out!

714
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:06,200
- You've gotta try.
- Alright.

715
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,800
If you don't move
you're gonna get left behind.

716
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,600
Let's go.

717
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:51,200
Stotzer, can you hear me?

718
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:54,800
Loud and clear.

719
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:56,400
We lost Mason.

720
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:57,400
They lost Mason.

721
00:47:58,400 --> 00:47:59,600
Everyone else?

722
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:01,600
No, everybody else is okay.

723
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:02,400
Stick together.

724
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:04,000
If you get separated they'll pick you off.

725
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:05,000
Okay, gotcha.

726
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:08,800
Man said stay close, stay alive.

727
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:16,600
That's Duncan.

728
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:19,800
We're losing light, I say we camp here.

729
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:21,000
We've been going for hours.

730
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,000
No, we don't let Duncan get away.

731
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:24,200
I'm sure he's beat, too.

732
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:26,400
I say we continue!

733
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:29,000
Get this through your head, alright?

734
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,000
It's not a scientific mission anymore.

735
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:34,200
This is a survival mission,
which means I'm in charge.

736
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:35,200
You got that?

737
00:48:36,200 --> 00:48:37,800
Look, you wanna go, you go.

738
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:39,000
You got a 50/50 shot of making it.

739
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:39,800
Good luck to you.

740
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:44,200
Fine, we'll camp here for the night.

741
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:46,800
Get us some firewood.

742
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:04,000
It's safe to assume I'm not gonna

743
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:05,800
make the Employee of the Month list.

744
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:08,600
Well, that makes both of us.

745
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:11,600
Being on James' bad side
is not a nice place to be.

746
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:13,200
I'm sorry to hear that.

747
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:15,200
It's been coming for a while.

748
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:16,600
In a way it's almost a relief.

749
00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:19,800
Do you believe that I actually thought

750
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:22,400
this trip might be good
for our relationship?

751
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:25,000
I'm such a fool.

752
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:28,000
Like I said, any guy let's
a girl like you get away,

753
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,200
gotta be something wrong with him.

754
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:31,800
What about you?

755
00:49:31,800 --> 00:49:34,000
Any special girl in your life?

756
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:35,200
The last girlfriend I had said

757
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:39,400
I was stuck in a permanent combat mode.

758
00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:40,600
I think the exact words she used,

759
00:49:40,600 --> 00:49:43,800
I think she said I was,
I was disconnected.

760
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:47,200
Said I treated everybody like a target.

761
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,200
I don't know, you know.

762
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:51,800
Well, I think that's her loss.

763
00:49:54,600 --> 00:49:56,400
Yeah, I guess James and I have a lot

764
00:49:56,400 --> 00:50:00,000
to talk about if we make it back.

765
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,800
Now see, that's the wrong attitude.

766
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:03,400
When we make it back.

767
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:04,200
Yes, sir.

768
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:07,800
I don't know what we would
have done if you hadn't--

769
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:13,600
There's a bear right behind you.

770
00:50:13,600 --> 00:50:15,000
- Just, just, shh!
- Oh, my God!

771
00:50:17,800 --> 00:50:20,200
Oh, my God, there's one there, too.

772
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:27,400
Stay here.

773
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:33,000
Carlson, get these two, I got this one.

774
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:43,200
For God's sake, shoot!

775
00:50:50,600 --> 00:50:52,200
Carlson!

776
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:12,600
What was that all about?

777
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:21,600
Cain!

778
00:51:23,600 --> 00:51:25,000
Cain.

779
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:25,800
Cain.

780
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:30,400
Oh, my God!

781
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:31,400
Oh, my God!

782
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:36,600
Stotzer?

783
00:51:36,600 --> 00:51:38,200
Vickers, do you read me?

784
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:42,400
Stotzer, over.

785
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:44,600
It's Allison, Cain is really hurt.

786
00:51:44,600 --> 00:51:46,200
And Carlson's gone.

787
00:51:47,600 --> 00:51:48,800
Okay, how bad is Cain?

788
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:51,800
He's out cold.

789
00:51:51,800 --> 00:51:53,800
Okay, Vickers is gonna
try and track your signal.

790
00:51:53,800 --> 00:51:54,600
We're on our way.

791
00:51:54,600 --> 00:51:56,400
You do what you can for Cain, over.

792
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:57,200
Okay.

793
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:10,400
It's clear, no sign of those things.

794
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:11,800
The cave must not be big enough.

795
00:52:11,800 --> 00:52:12,600
Let's hope.

796
00:52:21,600 --> 00:52:24,200
It should give us
protection for the night.

797
00:52:24,200 --> 00:52:25,400
One can only hope.

798
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:27,600
I gotta go get the
rest of the equipment.

799
00:52:27,600 --> 00:52:30,000
Vickers, you stay here with them.

800
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:31,000
I'm coming.

801
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:35,200
How is he?

802
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:36,600
He's gonna be okay.

803
00:52:36,600 --> 00:52:39,000
He's gonna have one screaming
headache when he wakes up.

804
00:52:40,600 --> 00:52:42,400
So, you and Stotz, huh?

805
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:44,800
Yeah.

806
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:46,000
He's an alright guy.

807
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:48,600
Just don't tell him I said that.

808
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:52,000
You?

809
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,800
I got a beautiful wife, two great kids.

810
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:57,600
If I didn't have them to think about

811
00:52:57,600 --> 00:52:58,800
I don't know how I'd get through this.

812
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:07,000
My head.

813
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:08,000
Welcome back.

814
00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:10,800
How many?

815
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:12,400
Wait, how many fingers.

816
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:13,200
There's five.

817
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:14,000
There's five.

818
00:53:15,800 --> 00:53:16,600
Glad to have you back.

819
00:53:16,600 --> 00:53:18,200
I'm tired of taking up your slack.

820
00:53:22,200 --> 00:53:23,400
Where are we?

821
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:24,200
We're in a cave.

822
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:26,400
Stotzer and I are gonna take turns

823
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:28,000
covering the entrance till dawn, you rest.

824
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:30,000
Yeah.

825
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:36,400
You can boss us around later, alright?

826
00:53:37,400 --> 00:53:38,200
Alright.

827
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:41,200
Welcome back, boss.

828
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:44,000
I'll take first watch.

829
00:53:54,600 --> 00:53:57,400
Hey, doc, I think I messed up my ankle.

830
00:53:57,400 --> 00:53:58,400
It's been killing me.

831
00:53:58,400 --> 00:53:59,600
You wanna have a look at it?

832
00:53:59,600 --> 00:54:00,800
Yeah, sit down over
there, I'll check it out.

833
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:12,000
Hey, you had me worried.

834
00:54:13,400 --> 00:54:14,600
I got a thick head.

835
00:54:15,400 --> 00:54:16,600
Yeah, I'll say.

836
00:54:18,600 --> 00:54:20,400
So he come back yet?

837
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:21,400
Who, James?

838
00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:22,200
No.

839
00:54:22,200 --> 00:54:24,600
But if he does I'm gonna break his neck.

840
00:54:24,600 --> 00:54:25,400
Drink this.

841
00:54:26,600 --> 00:54:27,400
Thanks.

842
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:33,600
I don't think I can
go through this again.

843
00:54:44,800 --> 00:54:46,200
I'm gonna go work.

844
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:52,200
I might as well find out
everything I can about this place.

845
00:54:52,200 --> 00:54:53,000
You rest.

846
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:47,800
Hi there!

847
00:55:51,800 --> 00:55:53,400
Well, well, well!
- Yes!

848
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:54,400
Thank you.

849
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:56,000
Made it just for you.

850
00:55:57,800 --> 00:55:59,800
Well then, I guess I owe you a dinner.

851
00:55:59,800 --> 00:56:02,400
Yeah, when we get back to Earth.

852
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:05,200
Steak and ribs, I can smell it.

853
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:07,000
Steak and lobster.

854
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:12,000
Look, I promise you

855
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:15,400
I will get us home.

856
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:18,000
Gretchen!

857
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:33,600
Gretchen!

858
00:56:33,600 --> 00:56:34,400
Gretchen!

859
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:36,600
It's human.

860
00:56:38,200 --> 00:56:40,200
What, are you telling me
humans developed here as well?

861
00:56:40,200 --> 00:56:41,800
The DNA matrix contained all

862
00:56:41,800 --> 00:56:43,800
the basic elements of life on Earth.

863
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:44,800
Whoa, whoa, so you mean we gotta

864
00:56:44,800 --> 00:56:46,000
deal with Neanderthals, too?

865
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:47,600
Not unless they
developed cranial surgery.

866
00:56:47,600 --> 00:56:49,000
This skull has a plate in it.

867
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,000
Whoever it belongs to was just here.

868
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:52,800
What do you think, about six months ago?

869
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:53,600
Yeah, possibly.

870
00:56:53,600 --> 00:56:55,600
That's when Harling and his team came.

871
00:56:55,600 --> 00:56:56,800
He had a metal plate in his skull

872
00:56:56,800 --> 00:56:58,800
after taking shrapnel in Mongolia.

873
00:56:58,800 --> 00:57:00,600
What, you're telling me that's Harling?

874
00:57:00,600 --> 00:57:02,600
Son of a bitch!

875
00:57:02,600 --> 00:57:03,800
I knew we weren't the
first people through.

876
00:57:03,800 --> 00:57:06,000
Harling must have been a guinea pig.

877
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:07,600
Even James wouldn't deliberately

878
00:57:07,600 --> 00:57:09,200
send people to their deaths.

879
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:11,200
It had to be something else.

880
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:12,600
Something worth dying for.

881
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:16,600
Listen, Casanova, you should stop

882
00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:18,000
worrying about your love life and start

883
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:19,600
watching the front of this cave.

884
00:57:19,600 --> 00:57:21,200
You didn't get enough sleep, Vickers?

885
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:22,000
Hey!

886
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:23,800
Man, I will put you
to sleep permanently--

887
00:57:23,800 --> 00:57:26,000
Hey, hey, guys!

888
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:27,800
Now's not the time to fight.

889
00:57:27,800 --> 00:57:30,000
There's bears out there that
want to turn us into pulp.

890
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:30,800
Come on!

891
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:37,000
It sounds like they're
talking to each other.

892
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:38,800
Sounds like they're
doing more than talking.

893
00:57:38,800 --> 00:57:39,800
Maybe they're still hungry.

894
00:57:39,800 --> 00:57:41,800
Well, there's fish here, so why us?

895
00:57:41,800 --> 00:57:43,400
It could be the end
of a hibernation cycle.

896
00:57:43,400 --> 00:57:45,600
The first awake are usually the hungriest

897
00:57:45,600 --> 00:57:47,200
and the most aggressive.

898
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:49,400
And there's more of
those things waking up?

899
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:51,600
Easy, Stotzer!

900
00:57:51,600 --> 00:57:52,400
Don't worry about me, boss.

901
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:54,400
I'm cool, calm and collected.

902
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:56,000
Good, now get back on point.

903
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:57,600
Everybody else inside.

904
00:57:57,600 --> 00:57:58,400
Come on.

905
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:11,200
What's it say?

906
00:58:12,200 --> 00:58:14,400
The remote hub is going
through a power cycle.

907
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:15,600
So it's been activated?

908
00:58:15,600 --> 00:58:17,200
Well, maybe, or it could
be the battery cycling

909
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:19,400
because the power core is failing.

910
00:58:19,400 --> 00:58:21,400
Any way to know which one?

911
00:58:21,400 --> 00:58:22,200
Sorry.

912
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:25,200
Okay, how far?

913
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:28,000
That way, approximately two kilometers.

914
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:29,000
Let's grab the gear.

915
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:36,800
Allison, you're sure there's no other way?

916
00:58:36,800 --> 00:58:38,000
No, it's straight down.

917
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:41,000
Should be okay.

918
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,400
It doesn't look okay to me.

919
00:58:43,400 --> 00:58:45,000
We'll be fine.

920
00:58:53,800 --> 00:58:55,400
Alright, we'll tie off here.

921
00:59:12,800 --> 00:59:14,800
How we doing this, chief?

922
00:59:14,800 --> 00:59:16,000
This is the way it's gonna work.

923
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:19,600
I'm gonna go down first
followed by the two girls.

924
00:59:19,600 --> 00:59:21,600
You two are gonna stay on point up here.

925
00:59:21,600 --> 00:59:23,800
When I give you the signal
you're gonna follow us down.

926
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:28,000
Alright.

927
00:59:29,600 --> 00:59:33,000
Alright, back into me, I gotcha, I gotcha.

928
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:33,800
Okay.

929
00:59:34,800 --> 00:59:37,000
Go, just go really slow.

930
00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:43,200
That's it, a little further.

931
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:44,400
Look up.

932
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:46,400
Look up, don't look down.

933
00:59:52,800 --> 00:59:53,600
Gretchen!

934
01:00:06,200 --> 01:00:08,200
Vickers, I'm going down.

935
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:20,800
Oh, God!

936
01:00:20,800 --> 01:00:24,200
It looks like she has internal bleeding.

937
01:00:27,600 --> 01:00:28,600
What happened?

938
01:00:28,600 --> 01:00:30,400
The carabiner must have broke.

939
01:00:31,200 --> 01:00:34,200
Stay down!

940
01:00:40,800 --> 01:00:42,200
Wrong day, buddy.

941
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:49,000
I still owe you a dinner.

942
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:06,800
Hey, how you doin'?

943
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:09,400
The pills are kicking in.

944
01:01:10,800 --> 01:01:14,000
I'm gonna be in dreamland soon.

945
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,000
Can I get you anything?

946
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:17,600
Some French toast and a latte.

947
01:01:19,400 --> 01:01:22,200
My whole life I've taken care of patients.

948
01:01:23,400 --> 01:01:24,600
Now I am the patient.

949
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:27,000
It's awful.

950
01:01:31,600 --> 01:01:33,800
How do you do what you do?

951
01:01:35,200 --> 01:01:37,600
I've got nothing to lose.

952
01:01:37,600 --> 01:01:40,200
I don't know, maybe it's time you did.

953
01:01:42,600 --> 01:01:43,400
What?

954
01:01:46,800 --> 01:01:48,200
Found something to lose.

955
01:01:51,400 --> 01:01:53,000
- Stotzer?
- Yeah?

956
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:57,400
I'll check on you later.

957
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:03,200
What is it?

958
01:02:11,400 --> 01:02:12,200
Movement.

959
01:02:13,600 --> 01:02:14,800
What do you see?

960
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:20,600
Gretchen!

961
01:02:31,800 --> 01:02:35,000
Wait, you're gonna hit Gretchen!

962
01:02:36,600 --> 01:02:37,600
I'm going after her!

963
01:02:37,600 --> 01:02:39,400
- No, John, no!
- Let me go!

964
01:02:39,400 --> 01:02:40,600
- John!
- Let go of me!

965
01:02:40,600 --> 01:02:42,400
- Too late!
- No, not Gretchen!

966
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:43,800
- She's gone!
- No!

967
01:02:44,800 --> 01:02:46,200
Come on, stop, come on!

968
01:02:54,400 --> 01:02:55,600
I always believed that there had to be

969
01:02:55,600 --> 01:02:59,200
a scientific explanation for everything.

970
01:02:59,200 --> 01:03:00,600
Science was the only answer.

971
01:03:02,800 --> 01:03:07,200
Since I've been here I'm
rapidly becoming a skeptic.

972
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:14,400
Oh, it's the hub.

973
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:18,000
According to these readings there

974
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:21,000
haven't been any recent power spikes.

975
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:22,800
So nobody's using it?

976
01:03:22,800 --> 01:03:24,000
So it would appear.

977
01:03:25,400 --> 01:03:28,400
Well, finally some good news.

978
01:03:29,200 --> 01:03:31,000
That's Gretchen, she's alive!

979
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:32,600
We don't know what that was.

980
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:33,600
It's her, damn it, Cain!

981
01:03:33,600 --> 01:03:34,600
I know it's her!

982
01:03:34,600 --> 01:03:35,600
John, I know it's awful,

983
01:03:35,600 --> 01:03:37,600
but you can't go out there, alright?

984
01:03:37,600 --> 01:03:39,000
They hunt in packs.

985
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:41,000
Come on, they communicate,
they lure their prey.

986
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:43,200
Yeah, we have no idea
where it's coming from, man.

987
01:03:43,200 --> 01:03:44,600
Cain's right, Stotzer.

988
01:03:44,600 --> 01:03:46,000
They could be trying to separate us.

989
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,000
They're bears, damn it!

990
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,400
They could be trying to use her as bait.

991
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:52,600
John, just relax.

992
01:03:52,600 --> 01:03:54,000
Okay, come on.

993
01:03:55,200 --> 01:03:56,800
Yeah, right, boss.

994
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:39,000
Gretchen!

995
01:04:39,800 --> 01:04:40,800
Oh, my God!

996
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:43,200
I'm here now.

997
01:04:43,200 --> 01:04:45,600
I'm gonna get you out.

998
01:04:45,600 --> 01:04:47,200
I'm getting you home.

999
01:04:51,800 --> 01:04:52,800
Oh, God, no!

1000
01:04:56,200 --> 01:04:57,000
Gretchen.

1001
01:05:19,800 --> 01:05:22,200
I finished packing
Gretchen's medical supplies.

1002
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:25,800
I hope we can find the
rest of the hardware.

1003
01:05:25,800 --> 01:05:27,400
As fast as he was moving it's a good bet

1004
01:05:27,400 --> 01:05:28,600
he left a trail we can follow.

1005
01:05:28,600 --> 01:05:30,000
I don't wanna lose anybody else.

1006
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,400
Yeah, we're getting low on ammo.

1007
01:05:32,400 --> 01:05:33,800
Make 'em count.

1008
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:32,000
Long time, no see.

1009
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:36,400
Where you headed, Duncan?

1010
01:06:39,200 --> 01:06:40,200
It's not what you think.

1011
01:06:40,200 --> 01:06:42,400
Oh, you didn't leave us for dead?

1012
01:06:42,400 --> 01:06:43,200
No.

1013
01:06:45,800 --> 01:06:47,200
Where's the hub, Duncan?

1014
01:06:47,200 --> 01:06:48,000
It's near.

1015
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:49,800
Let's go.

1016
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:17,800
My foot!

1017
01:07:19,400 --> 01:07:20,400
Can you move?

1018
01:07:21,800 --> 01:07:23,600
I'm trying, I think it's twisted.

1019
01:07:26,800 --> 01:07:28,200
Use this.

1020
01:07:28,200 --> 01:07:29,600
We're almost to the top.

1021
01:07:29,600 --> 01:07:30,400
Hub's just the other side.

1022
01:07:30,400 --> 01:07:31,600
Let's go!

1023
01:07:31,600 --> 01:07:34,800
Come on, it's not that much further.

1024
01:07:38,400 --> 01:07:39,200
Cain!

1025
01:07:39,200 --> 01:07:41,200
Everybody down!

1026
01:07:48,200 --> 01:07:50,200
Nice shootin', boss.

1027
01:07:53,200 --> 01:07:55,200
We can't afford to stop again, let's go.

1028
01:07:59,200 --> 01:08:00,600
How far are we from the hub?

1029
01:08:01,600 --> 01:08:04,600
I don't know, I haven't
been able to locate it yet.

1030
01:08:05,400 --> 01:08:06,800
Why should I trust you?

1031
01:08:06,800 --> 01:08:07,600
Cain!

1032
01:08:07,600 --> 01:08:09,200
Carlson knew that
the planet is unstable.

1033
01:08:09,200 --> 01:08:11,800
The telemetry from the
Unibot confirmed it.

1034
01:08:13,200 --> 01:08:14,000
He set us up!

1035
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:19,200
What about the oxygen plant?

1036
01:08:19,200 --> 01:08:21,400
It was just a con to get you up here.

1037
01:08:21,400 --> 01:08:23,400
So the planet's worthless?

1038
01:08:23,400 --> 01:08:24,800
That doesn't make any sense.

1039
01:08:25,600 --> 01:08:27,400
No, you're wrong in your assumption

1040
01:08:27,400 --> 01:08:28,800
that this planet is worthless.

1041
01:08:28,800 --> 01:08:30,600
It's got something to do with what

1042
01:08:30,600 --> 01:08:31,400
happened to Harling and his team.

1043
01:08:32,400 --> 01:08:33,800
We found Harling's skull.

1044
01:08:35,800 --> 01:08:36,600
Oh, my God!

1045
01:08:39,600 --> 01:08:40,600
What have I done?

1046
01:08:40,600 --> 01:08:42,200
You can make peace later.

1047
01:08:42,200 --> 01:08:44,400
I need to know exactly
what's going on here.

1048
01:08:47,800 --> 01:08:51,000
Six months ago we sent out a recon party

1049
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:53,200
of five to do very much what we're doing.

1050
01:08:54,200 --> 01:08:55,600
Explore the planet and establish

1051
01:08:55,600 --> 01:08:57,200
a base for future colonization.

1052
01:08:59,800 --> 01:09:02,200
The first party soon discovered that

1053
01:09:03,200 --> 01:09:06,000
the planet's unstable and
it's developing exponentially.

1054
01:09:07,600 --> 01:09:09,000
It will eventually implode.

1055
01:09:10,800 --> 01:09:13,800
The genetically mutated bears
are much smarter and stronger

1056
01:09:13,800 --> 01:09:15,800
than anything we've ever seen on Earth.

1057
01:09:15,800 --> 01:09:16,600
Then, why?

1058
01:09:17,600 --> 01:09:19,800
If the planet can't be colonized,

1059
01:09:19,800 --> 01:09:22,400
then why come back here at all?

1060
01:09:22,400 --> 01:09:24,800
Because first team
discovered something else.

1061
01:09:25,600 --> 01:09:28,200
Something that makes it
unnecessary to leave the Earth!

1062
01:09:28,200 --> 01:09:29,800
What is it?

1063
01:09:29,800 --> 01:09:32,200
The team had missed three check-ins.

1064
01:09:32,200 --> 01:09:33,600
Fortunately, one of them
survived long enough

1065
01:09:33,600 --> 01:09:35,400
to program the Unibot to return.

1066
01:10:27,200 --> 01:10:29,400
It wasn't like
anything we'd ever seen.

1067
01:10:29,400 --> 01:10:32,400
Cellular regeneration
on a macro time scale.

1068
01:10:34,400 --> 01:10:36,200
What the?

1069
01:10:55,600 --> 01:10:59,400
Carlson calls it 'vida
sera', the serum of life.

1070
01:10:59,400 --> 01:11:01,400
So is that why he came here, to find it?

1071
01:11:01,400 --> 01:11:03,000
With a perfect sample of vida sera

1072
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:04,800
we can replicate it back on Earth.

1073
01:11:05,800 --> 01:11:06,600
Can you imagine?

1074
01:11:07,600 --> 01:11:09,600
A vaccine capable of rejuvenating cells

1075
01:11:09,600 --> 01:11:11,400
that have been ravaged by cancer!

1076
01:11:11,400 --> 01:11:13,400
Lung cells that have been
damaged by pollution!

1077
01:11:13,400 --> 01:11:17,400
Mankind can evolve and live
on Earth as polluted as it is.

1078
01:11:17,400 --> 01:11:18,200
Let's roll!

1079
01:11:18,200 --> 01:11:20,600
Why not just send a bot
to collect the sample?

1080
01:11:20,600 --> 01:11:21,800
Why put us at risk?

1081
01:11:21,800 --> 01:11:23,600
Because we didn't have exact coordinates

1082
01:11:23,600 --> 01:11:25,600
and remote surface scans
came back negative.

1083
01:11:25,600 --> 01:11:27,000
Well, you should have told us.

1084
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:28,000
You could have at least--

1085
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:29,000
Carlson swore me to silence.

1086
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:30,400
He said he'd make me responsible

1087
01:11:30,400 --> 01:11:33,000
for the disappearance of the first team!

1088
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:35,600
And he gave you a share of the profits.

1089
01:11:35,600 --> 01:11:37,200
I didn't think I had a choice.

1090
01:11:38,800 --> 01:11:40,200
You still monitoring that hub?

1091
01:11:40,200 --> 01:11:41,800
Yeah.

1092
01:11:41,800 --> 01:11:44,200
Less than a kilometer to go, that way.

1093
01:11:44,200 --> 01:11:45,200
Yeah, we're going home.

1094
01:11:45,200 --> 01:11:46,400
Wait a minute, wait a minute!

1095
01:11:46,400 --> 01:11:47,400
What about the vida sera?

1096
01:11:47,400 --> 01:11:48,200
We've come this far!

1097
01:11:48,200 --> 01:11:49,800
It's Carlson's problem, it's not ours.

1098
01:11:49,800 --> 01:11:51,600
Think about what it
can do for the Earth.

1099
01:11:51,600 --> 01:11:52,400
For the evolution of man!

1100
01:11:52,400 --> 01:11:54,200
Cain, Duncan is right.

1101
01:11:54,200 --> 01:11:56,800
This may be our only chance
to get ahold of this stuff.

1102
01:11:56,800 --> 01:11:58,600
We can't really afford to pass that up.

1103
01:11:58,600 --> 01:11:59,400
My job is to protect your ass

1104
01:11:59,400 --> 01:12:00,600
and get us out of here in one piece,

1105
01:12:00,600 --> 01:12:02,000
and that's what I'm gonna do.

1106
01:12:08,400 --> 01:12:10,600
The missing cases.

1107
01:12:10,600 --> 01:12:11,800
I told you I sent them!

1108
01:12:11,800 --> 01:12:13,400
Alright, let's check them out.

1109
01:12:25,600 --> 01:12:26,400
They're empty!

1110
01:12:27,600 --> 01:12:31,000
Carlson!

1111
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:32,600
It's empty.

1112
01:12:43,400 --> 01:12:44,600
Hey guys, over here!

1113
01:12:53,200 --> 01:12:55,000
Without the hub we're stuck here.

1114
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:58,000
Where the hell is Carlson?

1115
01:12:58,000 --> 01:12:59,600
I don't know.

1116
01:12:59,600 --> 01:13:02,000
I swear guys, I'm a victim, too!

1117
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:03,200
Well, we gotta find him.

1118
01:13:03,200 --> 01:13:05,000
He's gotta be around here somewhere.

1119
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:06,800
I bet the vida sera's nearby.

1120
01:13:10,800 --> 01:13:11,800
Cain!

1121
01:13:11,800 --> 01:13:13,600
No, wait, don't go over there!

1122
01:13:13,600 --> 01:13:15,000
No, no, come on.

1123
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:16,000
What, come on!

1124
01:13:21,200 --> 01:13:22,600
Shoot me!

1125
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:26,400
Shoot me!

1126
01:13:47,600 --> 01:13:49,000
We gotta get out of here.

1127
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:51,000
They're gonna pick us
off one by one, let's go.

1128
01:14:21,200 --> 01:14:22,200
There it is!

1129
01:14:30,600 --> 01:14:31,800
Come on, shoot it!

1130
01:14:31,800 --> 01:14:33,800
It's too close to the hub.

1131
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:38,800
Hold this.

1132
01:14:40,200 --> 01:14:42,000
What are you doing?

1133
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:45,200
I'm gonna run a distraction
while you two fix the hub.

1134
01:14:45,200 --> 01:14:47,200
- What?
- That's suicide!

1135
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:01,800
This is insane.

1136
01:15:06,200 --> 01:15:07,200
Come here.

1137
01:15:08,400 --> 01:15:09,200
Come on.

1138
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:19,000
Let's go!

1139
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:32,800
Come on!

1140
01:15:39,400 --> 01:15:40,400
Okay.

1141
01:15:41,600 --> 01:15:42,400
That's it.

1142
01:15:46,400 --> 01:15:47,800
Okay, okay, okay.

1143
01:15:55,200 --> 01:15:56,600
The circuit board's gone!

1144
01:16:54,800 --> 01:16:55,800
Pot roast.

1145
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:06,400
Allison!

1146
01:17:11,200 --> 01:17:12,400
You bastard!

1147
01:17:14,600 --> 01:17:16,400
Didn't think you'd last this long.

1148
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:21,800
By now, I should learn not
to underestimate my Allison.

1149
01:17:24,200 --> 01:17:25,800
I think you've done enough damage.

1150
01:17:28,400 --> 01:17:30,000
She got to you, you fool.

1151
01:17:31,400 --> 01:17:33,400
You know how rich you can be?

1152
01:17:33,400 --> 01:17:35,800
Yeah, maybe, but I'm learning

1153
01:17:35,800 --> 01:17:38,600
that there's more to
life than money, James.

1154
01:17:38,600 --> 01:17:40,200
Who taught you that, Cain?

1155
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:45,600
Where is he?

1156
01:17:45,600 --> 01:17:47,800
He died protecting us.

1157
01:17:47,800 --> 01:17:49,400
Unlike you, he was concerned about

1158
01:17:49,400 --> 01:17:51,000
what happened to the rest of us.

1159
01:17:52,400 --> 01:17:54,400
You're making a mistake.

1160
01:17:54,400 --> 01:17:55,200
No, I already made one.

1161
01:17:55,200 --> 01:17:56,400
Now, you shut it!

1162
01:17:57,400 --> 01:17:58,400
It's your fortune.

1163
01:17:59,400 --> 01:18:01,200
Will you hold this?

1164
01:18:02,600 --> 01:18:07,600
The lady said shut up!

1165
01:18:11,600 --> 01:18:12,800
I got it.

1166
01:18:12,800 --> 01:18:16,000
I suppose he's told you he's
innocent of all this, huh?

1167
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:16,800
Duncan!

1168
01:18:19,600 --> 01:18:21,400
He should have the circuit board.

1169
01:18:21,400 --> 01:18:22,400
Cain!

1170
01:18:24,800 --> 01:18:25,600
Oh, my God!

1171
01:18:25,600 --> 01:18:27,400
How long's it gonna take
to get it up and running?

1172
01:18:28,400 --> 01:18:29,800
It's done.

1173
01:18:29,800 --> 01:18:30,800
Get on it.

1174
01:18:38,200 --> 01:18:39,400
So, is that it?

1175
01:18:39,400 --> 01:18:42,200
The vida sera, it was
so important to you.

1176
01:18:43,400 --> 01:18:45,800
You risked all our lives and for what?

1177
01:18:45,800 --> 01:18:48,000
So you could be even richer?

1178
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:49,800
What else is there?

1179
01:18:50,800 --> 01:18:53,400
Something you don't know
anything about; humanity.

1180
01:18:56,200 --> 01:18:58,400
You'll all pay for
this when we get back.

1181
01:18:59,600 --> 01:19:01,600
No, no, no, you'll pay.

1182
01:19:01,600 --> 01:19:03,200
I'll be filing for divorce.

1183
01:19:08,800 --> 01:19:10,200
It's not working.

1184
01:19:10,200 --> 01:19:11,400
He's done something to the circuitry.

1185
01:19:11,400 --> 01:19:13,400
We need the motherboard.

1186
01:19:20,200 --> 01:19:21,800
We're running out of time.

1187
01:19:21,800 --> 01:19:24,600
The core tectonics are shifting again.

1188
01:19:24,600 --> 01:19:26,600
This whole place is going to erupt.

1189
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:30,600
Where is it?

1190
01:19:33,600 --> 01:19:34,400
Cain.

1191
01:19:38,800 --> 01:19:40,000
I got two shells left.

1192
01:19:41,800 --> 01:19:43,200
Get it out of him.

1193
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:48,000
Point it at him and pull the trigger.

1194
01:19:56,600 --> 01:19:58,400
Get it out of him.

1195
01:20:07,200 --> 01:20:08,000
Where is it?

1196
01:20:10,200 --> 01:20:12,000
You're not gonna kill me.

1197
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:24,000
I'll blow it off.

1198
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:28,800
Where is it?

1199
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:31,600
My pack.

1200
01:20:31,600 --> 01:20:32,600
In the cave.

1201
01:20:34,600 --> 01:20:35,800
I think it's a trick.

1202
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:39,800
I'll go.

1203
01:20:41,400 --> 01:20:42,600
Caves go on forever.

1204
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:45,600
You need me to find it.

1205
01:20:45,600 --> 01:20:47,000
I'll risk it.

1206
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:48,400
Let me go.

1207
01:20:48,400 --> 01:20:50,600
- No, no.
- Cain, let me go.

1208
01:20:51,600 --> 01:20:52,400
A deal?

1209
01:20:54,400 --> 01:20:56,400
I'll take you to the motherboard

1210
01:20:56,400 --> 01:20:57,600
if you don't say anything about

1211
01:20:57,600 --> 01:20:59,800
what happened here when
we get back to Earth.

1212
01:21:01,600 --> 01:21:02,800
We all go.

1213
01:21:02,800 --> 01:21:03,800
You lead.

1214
01:21:04,600 --> 01:21:05,400
Get up.

1215
01:21:06,800 --> 01:21:08,800
Come on, get up, get up.

1216
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:12,200
What would we have done if you'd died?

1217
01:21:12,200 --> 01:21:14,200
And why would you give Duncan the gun?

1218
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:18,000
You're full of surprises.

1219
01:21:32,600 --> 01:21:34,600
Alright, which way?

1220
01:21:34,600 --> 01:21:37,000
Left, it's not far.

1221
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:38,600
It stinks in here.

1222
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:46,800
You okay?

1223
01:21:49,600 --> 01:21:51,400
Yeah.

1224
01:21:51,400 --> 01:21:53,200
- You alright?
- Yeah.

1225
01:22:58,200 --> 01:23:01,200
Cain, I don't think this is a rock.

1226
01:23:35,400 --> 01:23:36,200
Duncan!

1227
01:24:06,200 --> 01:24:08,800
Cain, hold them off!

1228
01:24:10,400 --> 01:24:12,200
Allison, get out of here!

1229
01:24:12,200 --> 01:24:13,600
I'm not going without you!

1230
01:24:13,600 --> 01:24:15,600
It can only take one at a time, go!

1231
01:24:21,600 --> 01:24:23,600
I'm right behind you, go!

1232
01:24:28,200 --> 01:24:29,000
Allison!

1233
01:25:40,400 --> 01:25:42,600
Thank you all for coming.

1234
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:50,600
As the sole inheritor of
the Calron Corporation

1235
01:25:50,600 --> 01:25:53,800
my late husband, James Carlson,

1236
01:25:53,800 --> 01:25:55,600
has left me a legacy of healing.

1237
01:25:56,600 --> 01:25:58,800
And it is with great pride that

1238
01:25:58,800 --> 01:26:02,600
I announce to you our newest product;

1239
01:26:02,600 --> 01:26:07,200
a cellular regeneration
compound, Vida Sera.

1240
01:26:08,800 --> 01:26:10,000
The miraculous properties of

1241
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:13,000
this compound are already being explored.

1242
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:16,800
Regrowth of cells damaged
by cancer and disease.

1243
01:26:16,800 --> 01:26:19,400
Even regrowth of entire limbs.

1244
01:26:20,600 --> 01:26:22,600
And I am pleased to introduce to you

1245
01:26:22,600 --> 01:26:27,200
our first successful test
subject; Randall Cain.

1246
01:26:35,600 --> 01:26:39,000
We've barely scratched the
surface of the serum's potential.

1247
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:42,600
And I pledge to you
now that I will utilize

1248
01:26:42,600 --> 01:26:45,200
the full assets of Calron Corporation

1249
01:26:45,200 --> 01:26:47,000
and its subsidiaries to ensure

1250
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:50,000
that every man, woman and child on Earth

1251
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:54,200
is given a new chance at
a full and healthy life.

1252
01:26:55,800 --> 01:26:57,600
May each of us make the most of it.

1253
01:27:01,400 --> 01:27:03,000
This way, please!

1254
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:04,800
This way, please!

1255
01:27:04,800 --> 01:27:06,000
This way!
