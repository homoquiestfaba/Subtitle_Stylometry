1
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,560
How are you?

2
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:17,520
People, I can't hear you.

3
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:23,720
That's too loud.

4
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:25,280
Thanks for coming out tonight.

5
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:28,200
My name is Tig Notaro, and--

6
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,360
No, no, no, no, no.

7
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:33,880
Let's-- let's relax.
Um...

8
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:39,520
Who wants to hear
a story about Kool-Aid?

9
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:45,920
It's about the Kool-Aid Man.

10
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:47,800
<i>And, um--</i>

11
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:54,400
I don't know if the commercials
still are on TV. I have no idea.

12
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,240
Has anyone seen
a Kool-Aid commercial?

13
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:59,720
- Oh, yeah.
- I am not--oh, yeah.

14
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,840
I just found part of my dinner
in my mouth and chewed it.

15
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:12,400
Yeah, I don't know if the Kool-Aid Man
is on commercials anymore.

16
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:16,080
I don't care about
if my material is relevant.

17
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:22,000
I do "Sanford and Son" jokes.

18
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:25,880
I do whatever feels right.

19
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:29,880
Does anyone-- is anyone not
familiar with the Kool-Aid Man?

20
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:32,280
Everyone.

21
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:35,960
Tig, are you kidding me?
Everyone.

22
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:40,280
I bet there is somebody
out there that's like,

23
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:42,880
"Who's the Kool-Aid Man?"

24
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:49,800
The Kool-Aid Man is a pitcher.

25
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:58,440
No real clear indication
that he's a man, but--

26
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:01,680
<i>has kind of a rounded bottom.</i>

27
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,160
<i>But somehow he's for sure a man.</i>

28
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:10,120
He, I guess, is aware
when people buy Kool-Aid.

29
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,720
<i>Kicks down walls.</i>

30
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,960
Right now,
the person that didn't know

31
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,160
who the Kool-Aid Man is like...

32
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,520
"What?"

33
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:33,760
Yeah, be careful.
He is out there.

34
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:39,400
Just to sidetrack here a little,
it reminds me of--

35
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:42,080
I had this job.
I worked with children.

36
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:45,560
<i>And there was this woman</i>
<i>that annoyed me to no end.</i>

37
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:49,200
<i>And when I was cleaning up,</i>
<i>sweeping, she was talking to me.</i>

38
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:52,200
<i>And I rarely paid attention</i>
<i>to what she said.</i>

39
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,920
<i>And this was so long ago.</i>

40
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,000
<i>And she was, like, going on and on</i>

41
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:58,960
<i>about dinosaurs and how they were,</i>
<i>you know, eating people.</i>

42
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,240
<i>And I was like, "Wait, what?</i>

43
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:04,040
<i>Why are we just</i>
<i>standing here?"</i>

44
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:06,200
<i>And she's like,</i>
<i>"Yeah, like, scientists,</i>

45
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:11,120
<i>you know, took an insect</i>
<i>and took the blood, and--"</i>

46
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,600
<i>And I was like, "And they're just</i>
<i>running around eating people?"</i>

47
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:16,960
<i>And she's like, "Yes, I can't believe</i>
<i>you haven't heard about this."</i>

48
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,920
<i>Had no idea it was</i>
<i>"Jurassic Park."</i>

49
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,680
What does that have to do
with the Kool-Aid Man?

50
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:29,920
I don't even-- I can't even
follow myself here.

51
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:33,760
<i>Guys, have you seen</i>
<i>the Kool-Aid Man?</i>

52
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,760
<i>He has a round bottom</i>

53
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:39,720
<i>and a front bottom--</i>
<i>a round, front bottom.</i>

54
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,640
<i>He knows if you've had Kool-Aid.</i>

55
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,040
Kicks walls down,
busts through walls, fences.

56
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:52,480
You can't just have Kool-Aid.

57
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:55,080
Oh, I know where
my train of thought was.

58
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,520
I just saw it right there.

59
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,560
This guy was like, "Ah!"

60
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:06,200
"Ah! Get on with it!"

61
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:12,840
No.

62
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,160
The Kool-Aid Man
with his round bottom.

63
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:22,480
You can't just be hanging out
having Kool-Aid.

64
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:24,880
This guy is coming at you.

65
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:28,280
Wh-- is he dangerous?
Is he violent?

66
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:30,800
What is happening?

67
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:34,440
<i>It's weird enough</i>
<i>for the person who's having</i>

68
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:39,120
<i>the Kool-Aid</i>
<i>to have the Kool-Aid Man...</i>

69
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,760
<i>End up in their backyard.</i>

70
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:45,880
<i>That's a weird,</i>
<i>very uncomfortable day.</i>

71
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:54,640
That sounded like somebody
trying out a new laugh tonight.

72
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:59,120
Just like,
"I think I'm gonna do it now."

73
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:08,280
And their friend is like...

74
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:12,280
"Well, that's a new laugh."

75
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,920
"What? I thought
I'd try it out tonight.

76
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:19,440
I thought I'd blend in."

77
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:22,200
"No, you did not."

78
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:26,680
"When I did it in the car

79
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:29,800
"on the way,

80
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:32,000
it felt more natural."

81
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:42,120
Feel free to try and wedge it in
any other point.

82
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:46,000
So that's a-- that's an odd day

83
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,480
to be in your backyard,
Kool-Aid Man showing up

84
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:52,360
with a little rounded bottom
and front bottom.

85
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:59,120
But think about,
more importantly,

86
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:02,680
if he's busting through a fence,

87
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:06,080
that means he was waiting...

88
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:13,720
<i>In their neighbor's yard...</i>

89
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,840
<i>For God only knows how long.</i>

90
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:22,600
And even before that was like,

91
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:26,640
<i>walking through the neighborhood,</i>

92
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:32,000
you know, just sensing
that somebody got Kool-Aid,

93
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:36,080
<i>and then coming in the side gate,</i>

94
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,680
<i>waiting on the other-- he was just--</i>

95
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:42,200
<i>the whole time, nobody really</i>
<i>considers he was waiting</i>

96
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:47,520
<i>in the neighbor's yard</i>
<i>all that time.</i>

97
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,240
<i>And...</i>

98
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:52,760
<i>the neighbor is like,</i>

99
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:56,600
<i>in their kitchen</i>
<i>having breakfast or lunch</i>

100
00:07:56,760 --> 00:08:01,280
<i>and there's just, like,</i>
<i>a little pitcher with a couple of legs.</i>

101
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:04,120
And then who yells "Kool-Aid?"

102
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:06,560
Doesn't somebody yell
"Kool-Aid?"

103
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,160
What?

104
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:12,440
They go, "Hey, Kool-Aid."
And he goes, "Oh, yeah!"

105
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,240
Do you do voice-over?

106
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:30,240
Are they saying it like,
"Hey, Kool-Aid!"

107
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:34,400
Like they're happy
that they're having Kool-Aid?

108
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:38,360
No, like, "You're gonna pay
for that brick wall."

109
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,760
Like, "Pay me."

110
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:43,880
No, I think that happens before--

111
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:45,560
then he's like, "Oh, yeah,"

112
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:48,280
and then he busts down the wall.

113
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:51,080
Do you under-- do you understand?

114
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:57,400
We found the person not
familiar with the Kool-Aid Man.

115
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:02,720
Ah, we caught ya!

116
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:15,440
I dated somebody years ago,

117
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,600
and I realized

118
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:21,480
<i>that I was more into them</i>

119
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:23,640
<i>than they were into me.</i>

120
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:26,920
<i>And the way I knew this was--</i>

121
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:32,320
<i>I had to get</i>
<i>all four of my wisdom teeth</i>

122
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,280
<i>surgically removed.</i>

123
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,760
<i>And when you have it done,</i>

124
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:39,320
<i>they need you to have somebody</i>
<i>drive you there,</i>

125
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:42,040
<i>sign you in, and sign you out,</i>

126
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:44,600
<i>agreeing to drive you.</i>

127
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:46,960
<i>And I asked her</i>

128
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:50,520
<i>if she could drive me...</i>

129
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:52,800
<i>to the hospital.</i>

130
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:55,720
<i>She said that she could not.</i>

131
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:59,680
<i>The crazy part also being</i>

132
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:04,080
<i>that, um, she was self-employed.</i>

133
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:08,640
<i>And I was like, "Really?</i>

134
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:12,800
<i>"You-- you can't ask</i>
<i>the boss man for this one--</i>

135
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,480
<i>this one favor?"</i>

136
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:17,000
<i>And then I said,</i>
<i>"Oh, here's an idea.</i>

137
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:21,840
<i>How about you follow me</i>
<i>to the hospital,</i>

138
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,440
<i>and I'll park my car.</i>

139
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,640
<i>You sign me in,</i>
<i>and then you can just leave.</i>

140
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:28,600
<i>I'll get the procedure done,</i>
<i>and then I'll just drive myself home."</i>

141
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:31,600
<i>And she said, "I can do that."</i>

142
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:36,720
<i>In that moment, I was like, oh,</i>

143
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:40,040
<i>I like her more than she likes me.</i>

144
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:42,840
It's confirmed.

145
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,640
<i>So she signed me in</i>
<i>and went off to work.</i>

146
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:51,680
<i>I love you.</i>

147
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:56,400
<i>More than I love myself, apparently.</i>

148
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:00,960
<i>So I get my wisdom teeth</i>
<i>surgically removed.</i>

149
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:04,920
<i>And when they're moving me</i>
<i>to just kind of recuperate</i>

150
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:10,560
<i>in this room, I kind of</i>
<i>woke up and realized,</i>

151
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,040
<i>"Oh, yeah.</i>

152
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:16,080
<i>There's nobody here</i>
<i>to drive me home."</i>

153
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:19,000
<i>And as soon as the nurses</i>
<i>left the room,</i>

154
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:22,840
<i>I jumped up</i>
<i>and just started hauling ass</i>

155
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,120
<i>down the hall of the hospital,</i>

156
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:29,320
<i>all crooked, slamming into walls.</i>

157
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:33,080
<i>And, uh, I got out to my car,</i>

158
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:35,520
<i>started it up...</i>

159
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,360
<i>Drove off,</i>

160
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:42,680
<i>and I was awoken,</i>

161
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:47,400
<i>when I rear-ended</i>
<i>a car in front of me.</i>

162
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:49,000
<i>It wasn't really bad.</i>

163
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:53,440
<i>It was just-- I think I just</i>
<i>fell asleep at a light,</i>

164
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:56,040
<i>and my foot slid off the brake,</i>

165
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:59,800
<i>and I just rolled</i>
<i>into the car in front of me.</i>

166
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:02,720
<i>And the guy jumped out</i>
<i>of his car and was beating</i>

167
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,960
<i>on my window, like,</i>
<i>"What is your problem?"</i>

168
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,920
<i>And I was like, "I'm sorry.</i>

169
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,040
<i>Sorry about that."</i>

170
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:14,280
<i>There was no damage.</i>
<i>Everything was fine.</i>

171
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:16,760
<i>And so I continued on.</i>

172
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:23,080
<i>And when I finally got home,</i>

173
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:27,480
<i>I was in so much pain that I needed</i>

174
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:30,560
<i>to get back to the hospital.</i>

175
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:35,040
<i>I hadn't stopped at the pharmacy</i>
<i>to get pain medication,</i>

176
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:39,000
<i>so I just had four</i>
<i>gaping holes in my mouth,</i>

177
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:42,160
<i>and I realized there was no way</i>

178
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:45,320
<i>that I was gonna be able</i>
<i>to get back to the hospital.</i>

179
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:50,600
<i>So I went over to my neighbor</i>
<i>and friend Leslie's apartment,</i>

180
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:53,560
<i>and I knocked on her door.</i>

181
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:56,960
<i>"Leslie!</i>

182
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:00,120
<i>Leslie!"</i>

183
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,960
<i>No response.</i>

184
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:05,520
<i>And in my crazy, drugged-up head,</i>

185
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:10,200
<i>I had made up the story</i>
<i>that Leslie was in there</i>

186
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:13,040
<i>and she knew I was in pain</i>

187
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:16,760
<i>and she was just refusing</i>
<i>to help me.</i>

188
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:19,200
<i>So I got down.</i>

189
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:24,600
<i>"Leslie!</i>

190
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:26,520
<i>"Leslie!</i>

191
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:29,680
<i>Leslie."</i>

192
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,840
<i>I didn't see her.</i>

193
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:37,040
<i>So I got up, and then I went around</i>

194
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,640
<i>to the front of the apartment.</i>

195
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:41,480
<i>And one of the other tenants</i>

196
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:45,120
<i>was in a bikini, sun tanning.</i>

197
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:47,000
<i>And I come around the corner,</i>

198
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:50,840
<i>and she's like,</i>
<i>"Oh, my God!"</i>

199
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:55,000
<i>And I said, " Hi.</i>

200
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:57,880
<i>"Have you...</i>

201
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:01,320
<i>seen... Leslie?"</i>

202
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:11,600
<i>"No."</i>

203
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:15,960
<i>"Okay.</i>

204
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:19,280
<i>"Well, if you</i>

205
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:22,440
<i>"do see Leslie,</i>

206
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:25,400
<i>"can you tell her that</i>

207
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:31,440
<i>Tig needs to go</i>
<i>to the hospital?"</i>

208
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:38,240
<i>"Yes."</i>

209
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:40,320
<i>"Thank you so much.</i>

210
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:46,520
<i>"Leslie!</i>

211
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:54,520
<i>Leslie!"</i>

212
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:57,560
<i>Just stood next to this woman</i>
<i>in a bikini</i>

213
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:03,880
<i>throwing pebbles to Leslie's</i>
<i>second floor window.</i>

214
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:05,440
<i>No response.</i>

215
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,960
<i>So I was like, "You know what?</i>

216
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:11,240
<i>I'm gonna go ahead</i>
<i>and go back around,</i>

217
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:14,440
<i>try the door again."</i>

218
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:18,080
<i>So I went back over up the stairs.</i>

219
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,120
<i>However, this time,</i>

220
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:26,200
<i>there was a trail of fresh blood</i>

221
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:29,520
<i>leading to Leslie's door,</i>

222
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:33,160
<i>with a little pool at her door.</i>

223
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:36,560
<i>And I was like, "Oh, no!</i>

224
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:41,120
<i>Leslie! Leslie!"</i>

225
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:45,440
<i>This time, she opened the door.</i>

226
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:48,560
<i>And I was like,</i>
<i>"Are you okay?"</i>

227
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:52,960
<i>That was my blood.</i>

228
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:57,000
<i>My face was so numb</i>

229
00:15:57,160 --> 00:16:02,360
<i>that I did not realize</i>

230
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:05,800
<i>that...</i>

231
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:08,800
<i>I had blood</i>

232
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:12,000
<i>pouring out of my mouth,</i>

233
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:15,600
<i>down my shirt.</i>

234
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:18,760
<i>So if we can for a moment</i>

235
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:22,680
<i>go back to the woman sunbathing.</i>

236
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:29,400
<i>How did she not have</i>
<i>a single question for me?</i>

237
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:34,200
<i>'Cause, I mean,</i>
<i>I am essentially just</i>

238
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:36,280
<i>pouring blood out of my mouth like,</i>

239
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:38,280
<i>"Hey, if you see Leslie,</i>

240
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:41,680
<i>can you tell her that I need</i>
<i>to go to the hospital?"</i>

241
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,680
<i>And she's just like,</i>
<i>"Yeah, absolutely.</i>

242
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:46,120
<i>I'll let her know."</i>

243
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:47,880
<i>Not one question.</i>

244
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:51,880
<i>Like, how about,</i>
<i>"Oh, my God, what happened?"</i>

245
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:55,400
<i>Or, "Can I take you</i>
<i>to the hospital?"</i>

246
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:58,440
<i>What is her problem?</i>

247
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,480
<i>I mean, you know, to be fair,</i>

248
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:03,000
<i>maybe she also was self-employed</i>

249
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:05,960
<i>and, you know,</i>

250
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:10,920
<i>was unable to help me out.</i>

251
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,120
My friend that I grew up with--
her mother gave her a car.

252
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:25,360
And she had to drive it
to Los Angeles

253
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,640
and asked if I would go with her.

254
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:30,200
And so we hit the road

255
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:35,440
<i>and filled up on Funyuns</i>
<i>and what have you.</i>

256
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,440
<i>And then she said,</i>

257
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:41,840
<i>"I feel like I have an aunt</i>
<i>in West Texas somewhere,</i>

258
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,640
<i>and we'll go crash</i>
<i>at her place."</i>

259
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:48,320
<i>And I was like,</i>
<i>"Sure."</i>

260
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:54,200
<i>So we pull up to this woman.</i>

261
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:57,200
<i>I don't remember her name.</i>
<i>Great-Great Aunt Myrtle.</i>

262
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:59,720
<i>She's like the a-- Yoda--</i>

263
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:01,680
<i>grew up with Yoda.</i>

264
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:08,080
<i>I don't think anybody</i>
<i>has ever visited this person.</i>

265
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:10,960
<i>This elderly woman was just</i>
<i>pacing back and forth</i>

266
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:13,000
waiting for us once--

267
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,720
Oh, my God.

268
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:19,280
What do you mean, "Oh, my God"?

269
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:23,080
<i>There was an old woman</i>
<i>pacing at a window.</i>

270
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,600
<i>So excited somebody</i>
<i>was coming to her house.</i>

271
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,360
My apologies.

272
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:37,360
<i>We park.</i>
<i>We go in.</i>

273
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,000
<i>We are so tired.</i>

274
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:40,840
<i>We want to go to bed.</i>

275
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,520
<i>Mm-mm.</i>

276
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:44,560
<i>Guess who has cooked the equivalent</i>

277
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:48,200
<i>to a Thanksgiving feast.</i>

278
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:50,160
<i>Great-Great Aunt Myrtle.</i>

279
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:53,840
<i>And we're like,</i>
<i>"Oh, my gosh, thank you,"</i>

280
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,480
<i>and sat down</i>

281
00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:00,480
<i>and had to eat apple pie</i>

282
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,800
<i>and mashed potatoes</i>

283
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:05,520
<i>and just so-- creamed corn.</i>

284
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:08,000
And, you know,
you're probably not gonna like

285
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:10,520
what I'm about to say.

286
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:13,560
<i>She was boring.</i>

287
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:15,240
<i>All of her stories.</i>

288
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:19,240
<i>Everybody was dead</i>
<i>that she was talking about.</i>

289
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:24,960
<i>Our eyes were cr-- we were</i>
<i>so, like, "Oh, my gosh,""</i>

290
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:27,760
<i>having to eat this food,</i>

291
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:31,000
<i>tortured by her stories.</i>

292
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:32,520
<i>"Oh, and you think that's bad?</i>

293
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:35,400
<i>"Well, you know,</i>
<i>and then she'd come down...</i>

294
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,840
<i>"Do go on.</i>
<i>Do go on."</i>

295
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,360
<i>Oh, my God, I'm so tired.</i>

296
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:43,840
<i>We get up,</i>
<i>we help her do the dishes,</i>

297
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,040
<i>and then she explains</i>
<i>where our rooms are.</i>

298
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:52,160
<i>"Thank you so much for dinner,</i>
<i>for letting us stay."</i>

299
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:55,640
<i>We go to the room, and then we hear,</i>

300
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:58,520
<i>"Ah, ahh!"</i>

301
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:03,880
"Ahh!"
This old bat had fallen.

302
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:13,080
<i>We now have to take her</i>
<i>to the emergency room.</i>

303
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:18,800
<i>We are up all night</i>

304
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:23,080
<i>at the hospital with this woman.</i>

305
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:24,920
<i>She was fine.</i>

306
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:28,440
<i>She just needed a little</i>
<i>tender love and care.</i>

307
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:31,280
<i>We bring her back home,</i>
<i>drop her off.</i>

308
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,640
<i>It is now tomorrow.</i>

309
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:37,320
<i>And we need to just</i>
<i>get back on the road.</i>

310
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:38,920
<i>We're saying our goodbyes.</i>

311
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:41,920
<i>She did-- they had gotten her</i>
<i>a walker to help her,</i>

312
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:43,440
<i>you know, with her hip.</i>

313
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:46,520
<i>And she was like, "Oh, no,</i>
<i>"you're not getting on the road,</i>

314
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:49,200
<i>not till</i>
<i>I make you breakfast."</i>

315
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,640
<i>We had to sit down</i>

316
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:57,120
<i>while she pushed</i>

317
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,880
<i>a walker around</i>

318
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:03,440
<i>and made us a feast of a breakfast.</i>

319
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:06,360
<i>Never got sleep, got on the road,</i>

320
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:10,120
<i>saved 40 bucks on a motel room.</i>

321
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:12,000
<i>We won.</i>

322
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:16,640
<i>Thank you.</i>
<i>Um...</i>

323
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,560
You guys--I mean, fir--like,

324
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:22,080
"Oh, not our Aunt Myrtle!"

325
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:25,920
And then you're like, "

326
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:29,280
Yeah, pocket that 40 bucks."

327
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:34,520
<i>There's no way</i>
<i>she's still alive, by the way.</i>

328
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:39,920
<i>And probably nobody has found her.</i>

329
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,160
"Oh!

330
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:46,440
Not our Aunt Myrtle!"

331
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Um... I was in--
before Stephanie and I

332
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:59,360
<i>got married,</i>

333
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:02,360
before we were even engaged--

334
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:05,080
"Aww."
Mm-hmm.

335
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:07,280
It's a very sweet story
that I'm about to tell you.

336
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:10,200
<i>I was in Philadelphia,</i>
<i>and I had collapsed</i>

337
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:12,800
<i>after a show from internal bleeding.</i>

338
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:15,880
<i>And, um...</i>

339
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:17,360
- Whoo!
- Thank you.

340
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:22,520
<i>So, um, I-- luckily,</i>
<i>Stephanie was with me.</i>

341
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:26,800
<i>And we go-- we go to the hospital.</i>

342
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:30,520
<i>And when you're bleeding internally,</i>
<i>it is so painful.</i>

343
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:33,080
<i>It's-- your blood is supposed</i>
<i>to be inside of your veins.</i>

344
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:35,880
<i>And when it's just</i>
<i>going everywhere, it burns.</i>

345
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:39,080
<i>And so it was the most pain</i>
<i>I've ever felt in my life.</i>

346
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:41,480
<i>And I've felt some pain.</i>

347
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:44,280
And so I was like--
it was this kind of thing.

348
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:48,120
<i>Very attractive.</i>

349
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:50,600
<i>And we're not engaged yet.</i>

350
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:53,240
<i>And I'm--I'm just like--</i>

351
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:55,680
<i>And I'm-- I'm in the hospital,</i>

352
00:22:55,840 --> 00:23:00,160
<i>and the nurses are lifting me up</i>

353
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:03,640
<i>to put me on a bedpan.</i>

354
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:07,760
<i>And, um, I said,</i>

355
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:10,200
<i>"Is it okay</i>

356
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:13,600
<i>if I just go everywhere?"</i>

357
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:19,400
<i>And the nurses were like, "Um...</i>

358
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:22,280
<i>"Please, no.</i>

359
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:24,800
<i>"No. We have a bedpan.</i>

360
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,280
<i>That's what--"</i>

361
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:28,800
<i>But in my drugged mind,</i>
<i>I was just like,</i>

362
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:32,720
<i>"There's no way you can contain</i>

363
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:35,240
<i>what I'm about to do."</i>

364
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:36,920
<i>So I was just like--</i>

365
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:40,800
<i>"Can I just go on everybody,</i>
<i>just everywhere?"</i>

366
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:44,360
<i>They were just like, "No."</i>

367
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:48,200
<i>And so Stephanie was next</i>
<i>to me, and she was just like,</i>

368
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:49,920
<i>"I love you, I love you,"</i>

369
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:52,120
<i>as they're putting me on the bedpan.</i>

370
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:55,080
<i>And I was like--</i>

371
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:58,720
<i>And then I just thought...</i>

372
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:01,880
<i>It crossed my mind to be like,</i>

373
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:06,040
<i>"Will you marry me?"</i>

374
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:10,080
<i>Even though I was in so much pain</i>

375
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,640
<i>and on so many drugs,</i>
<i>I just thought,</i>

376
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:15,120
<i>"This would be unbelievable,</i>

377
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:18,080
<i>"to give her this moment</i>

378
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:21,320
<i>and to give the nurses</i>
<i>this moment."</i>

379
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:25,120
<i>I just seemed like the</i>
<i>grossest person in the world.</i>

380
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:29,080
<i>"Can I use everyone as a toilet?</i>

381
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:34,120
<i>"And will you...</i>

382
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:37,320
<i>spend the rest</i>
<i>of your life with me?"</i>

383
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:44,640
I knew in my drugged-up mind

384
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:49,280
that it would be so amazing
if people were like,

385
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:53,320
<i>"Oh, my God, you're engaged.</i>

386
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:57,080
<i>How did it happen?"</i>

387
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,760
<i>"Well...</i>

388
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:05,800
<i>"very typical love story.</i>

389
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:09,120
<i>"Tig was in a diaper.</i>

390
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,440
<i>They took it off."</i>

391
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:17,000
<i>That weekend together--</i>

392
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:19,720
<i>we had so many times</i>
<i>where I was like,</i>

393
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:21,320
<i>"This is the person,"</i>

394
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:24,240
<i>but that particular time,</i>
<i>I was like,</i>

395
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:26,600
<i>"We are good, we're all set,"</i>

396
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:29,880
<i>because I did have</i>
<i>to wear a diaper after that</i>

397
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:32,200
<i>and I had to have stomach surgery.</i>

398
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:35,440
<i>And so I was walking about</i>
<i>this fast in a diaper,</i>

399
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,920
<i>just, crinkle, crinkle.</i>

400
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:39,800
<i>And I couldn't leave Philadelphia.</i>

401
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:42,800
<i>I had to get a hotel in</i>
<i>Philadelphia to recover there.</i>

402
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:46,040
<i>So-- but I'm in my little diaper,</i>
<i>crinkle, crinkle,</i>

403
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:49,280
<i>as I'm moving, and this is</i>
<i>how I knew Stephanie--</i>

404
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,240
<i>I was like,</i>
<i>"Oh, she's the one."</i>

405
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:54,640
<i>She was laughing so hard</i>

406
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:58,680
<i>and, like, taking pictures</i>
<i>and videos of right here.</i>

407
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:01,760
<i>And I was like,</i>
<i>"Okay, fine, fine."</i>

408
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:03,480
<i>And so I have an entire iPhone</i>

409
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:07,520
<i>full of just close-ups</i>
<i>of my diapers.</i>

410
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:11,400
<i>And I just like, "I'm in pain,</i>
<i>but this is funny."</i>

411
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:17,280
<i>"I'll laugh another time."</i>

412
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:20,800
Um...

413
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:23,800
I think I've been hospitalized
six or seven times

414
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:26,040
in the past six years, and--

415
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:28,000
- Wow.
- It's a lot.

416
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:30,280
Like, my-- my stomach is scarred,

417
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:32,480
and just tonight I was saying
to Stephanie-- I was like,

418
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,600
<i>"This is hilarious.</i>

419
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:37,200
<i>You have one here,</i>
<i>one here, one here."</i>

420
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:40,560
<i>You know, the tits got</i>
<i>yanked off a few years ago,</i>

421
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:43,440
<i>tossed in a dumpster somewhere,</i>

422
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:45,240
<i>an alley in Hollywood.</i>

423
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:49,480
<i>I like to picture</i>
<i>just rodents fighting over...</i>

424
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:54,840
<i>When people ask, "Where--</i>
<i>where did your boobs go?"</i>

425
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:59,000
<i>I truly assume</i>
<i>they're just in an alley,</i>

426
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:01,480
<i>just getting run over.</i>

427
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:06,320
<i>A doctor cut 'em off,</i>
<i>tossed 'em and out the window.</i>

428
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:11,040
What else?
Um...

429
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:17,120
Uh, do you guys know
the comedian Jenny Slate?

430
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:22,880
<i>I was just curious.</i>

431
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:25,680
<i>I've known Jenny for years.</i>

432
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:30,320
<i>She's not, like, my best friend.</i>

433
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:37,200
<i>But we had each other's numbers,</i>

434
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:41,360
<i>and she texted me and said,</i>

435
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:44,800
<i>"Hey, I'm moving to L.A.</i>

436
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:46,360
<i>Do you want to have tea?"</i>

437
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:49,960
<i>And I said,</i>
<i>"I'm not feeling very well.</i>

438
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:51,600
<i>"I've been in bed.</i>

439
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:54,800
<i>"I should probably be better</i>
<i>in a couple of days.</i>

440
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:57,080
<i>Let's get in touch then."</i>

441
00:27:57,240 --> 00:28:01,040
<i>Jenny said, "Feel better."</i>
<i>She texted me in a couple of days.</i>

442
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:04,560
<i>"How you feeling, Tig?</i>
<i>Wanna have tea?"</i>

443
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:08,560
<i>"Jenny, turns out</i>
<i>I have pneumonia now.</i>

444
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:12,280
<i>"I can't have tea, but, uh,</i>

445
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:17,120
<i>when I'm feeling better,</i>
<i>absolutely, we'll grab tea."</i>

446
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:20,400
<i>Jenny texts me,</i>
<i>"How you feeling?"</i>

447
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:24,360
<i>"Oh, my gosh, Jenny.</i>
<i>I'm in the hospital.</i>

448
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:27,640
<i>"Uh, I have developed a disease.</i>

449
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:31,760
<i>"It's eating my digestive tract.</i>

450
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:34,600
<i>I can't have tea."</i>

451
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:36,600
<i>And she was like,</i>
<i>"Oh, my God."</i>

452
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:41,720
<i>And she said, "I'm going to Boston</i>
<i>"to get married this weekend.</i>

453
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:45,520
<i>I will check back in with you</i>
<i>when I'm back."</i>

454
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:48,720
<i>And I'm like,</i>
<i>"Okay, well, congrats."</i>

455
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:52,600
<i>I mean, I wasn't even invited</i>
<i>to her wedding, you know?</i>

456
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:55,840
<i>But, like, she's moving to L.A.</i>
<i>She wants to grab coffee. Sure.</i>

457
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,840
<i>She gets back to town,</i>

458
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,600
<i>and she's like, "Hey,</i>
<i>just seeing how you're doing."</i>

459
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:03,880
<i>"Jenny, I am now</i>
<i>out of the hospital,</i>

460
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:07,240
<i>"but my mother has had</i>
<i>a terrible accident,</i>

461
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:11,480
<i>and I have to go take her off</i>
<i>life support."</i>

462
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:15,880
<i>She's like, "Oh, my God."</i>

463
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:20,640
<i>"Yeah, I am so sorr--</i>
<i>I ju-- I'm sorry. Um...</i>

464
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:22,440
<i>Sorry for the inconvenience."</i>

465
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:26,720
<i>But, like, poor Jenny Slate.</i>

466
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:29,720
<i>I mean, okay,</i>
<i>I'm sure there were, like,</i>

467
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:31,360
<i>20 people that she was like,</i>

468
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,880
<i>"Hey, I'm moving to town.</i>
<i>Let's get tea."</i>

469
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:39,400
<i>She got caught up</i>
<i>in my swirling hell,</i>

470
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:42,880
<i>and had to keep checking in with me.</i>

471
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:45,360
<i>And now every ti-- I'm like,</i>

472
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:49,120
<i>"Oh, my God,</i>
<i>what am I gonna tell Jenny?"</i>

473
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:50,800
<i>"Jenny, I'm feeling a lot better.</i>

474
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:52,880
<i>"You know,</i>
<i>I'm gonna come through this.</i>

475
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:55,240
<i>"We will have our tea,</i>
<i>but I just gotta</i>

476
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:58,360
<i>to pull myself together a bit."</i>

477
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:00,160
<i>She checks in again.</i>

478
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:03,640
<i>And I was like, "Oh...</i>

479
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:05,800
<i>"my God.</i>

480
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:07,880
<i>"Jenny,</i>

481
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:10,000
<i>I have cancer."</i>

482
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:15,560
<i>And she was just like,</i>
<i>"What is going on?"</i>

483
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:18,480
<i>Like, every time</i>
<i>she contacted me, I was like--</i>

484
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:22,440
<i>it got worse and worse</i>
<i>and worse and worse.</i>

485
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:25,880
<i>Okay, I come through all of this,</i>

486
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:28,720
<i>and I was on my couch,</i>

487
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:31,600
<i>in recovery,</i>
<i>emotionally, physically.</i>

488
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:35,280
<i>Somebody had sent me</i>
<i>a huge bouquet of balloons.</i>

489
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:39,280
<i>You know, those just, like,</i>
<i>20 balloons kind of bouquet,</i>

490
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:40,760
<i>and it's like--you know?</i>

491
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:42,720
<i>Have you seen those?</i>
<i>They're gigantic.</i>

492
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:44,560
<i>And there was--</i>
<i>somebody had sent that.</i>

493
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:47,360
<i>It was taking up half of my loft.</i>
<i>It was like "Get well,"</i>

494
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:49,320
<i>"Feel better," "Hang in there,"</i>

495
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:51,320
<i>"Oh, my God,"</i>

496
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:54,120
<i>"Yikes,"</i>

497
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:56,920
<i>"Hoo, boy."</i>

498
00:30:57,080 --> 00:31:01,160
<i>So Jenny comes over to my loft</i>

499
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:03,040
<i>to have tea, finally.</i>

500
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:06,280
<i>And we're sitting there on my couch.</i>

501
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:11,320
<i>And, um-- and I was just barely</i>
<i>able to move at this point.</i>

502
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:14,200
<i>And I told Jenny, I said, "You know,</i>

503
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:17,400
<i>I've been sitting here</i>
<i>looking at these balloons."</i>

504
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:20,440
<i>I was like, "I want to release</i>

505
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:23,720
<i>"these balloons out into the world</i>

506
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:29,120
<i>"with a note that says,</i>
<i>'Hello, my name is Tig Notaro.</i>

507
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:32,080
<i>'I-- I have cancer,</i>

508
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:34,680
<i>but I'm--</i>
<i>I'm gonna beat this.'"</i>

509
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:37,800
<i>And, uh, Jenny's like,</i>
<i>"That is such a great idea.</i>

510
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:40,240
<i>Let's shove these</i>
<i>out of the window."</i>

511
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:43,600
<i>And so we open the window.</i>

512
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:46,440
<i>I'm like--</i>

513
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:49,200
<i>Pushing, you know.</i>
<i>All these huge balloons.</i>

514
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:52,600
<i>We're, like,</i>
<i>getting it across the room.</i>

515
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:55,360
<i>And-- and we push all these balloons</i>

516
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:59,360
<i>with all these little messages</i>
<i>out of my window.</i>

517
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:01,560
<i>And it has this little note</i>
<i>attached to it.</i>

518
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:05,760
<i>And out they went,</i>
<i>and it was this really</i>

519
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:09,360
<i>kind of freeing moment</i>
<i>that the balloons went out.</i>

520
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:14,880
<i>And then they immediately</i>
<i>got stuck on the fire escape</i>

521
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:19,040
<i>of the apartment right above me.</i>

522
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:23,360
<i>So now the man that lives above me</i>

523
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:29,120
<i>has just gotten this</i>
<i>outrageous message</i>

524
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:32,880
<i>from this cancer-riddled person,</i>

525
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:35,440
<i>just like, "Hey, I have--</i>

526
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:37,800
<i>"This is what's been</i>
<i>going on down here,</i>

527
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:41,440
<i>"but I'm doing a lot better.</i>
<i>I'm coming through it."</i>

528
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:44,720
<i>That's essentially</i>
<i>what he had to deal with</i>

529
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:48,720
<i>and pull off of his fire escape</i>
<i>and drag into his window,</i>

530
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:52,280
<i>thinking I was sending him</i>
<i>that message.</i>

531
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:54,680
<i>And then the awkwardness...</i>

532
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:58,120
<i>In the lobby and elevator</i>
<i>after that,</i>

533
00:32:58,280 --> 00:32:59,640
<i>just like, "How you doing?</i>

534
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:04,000
<i>"I'm still doing well.</i>
<i>Thank you.</i>

535
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:06,040
<i>How are your balloons?"</i>

536
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:14,600
This is a very stupid thought
that I had,

537
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:17,360
and I just have
to share it with you.

538
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:20,360
Why are they called "pigs"?

539
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:23,120
Why weren't they just called "bigs"?

540
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:27,560
Guys, I'm sorry.

541
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:31,320
They're big.
That's dumb, I know,

542
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:33,640
but it still crossed my mind.

543
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:37,400
Oh, my gosh, there's a spider.

544
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:47,440
So you guys were watching the--

545
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:49,040
It's coming down.

546
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:51,120
"It's coming down."

547
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:57,320
I love that this spider
lives up there

548
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:59,480
and is just like,

549
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:02,360
<i>"Who is...</i>

550
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:07,120
<i>"Who is performing tonight?</i>

551
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:14,400
<i>Not a fan."</i>

552
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:24,600
This spider is like, "Oh, I thought that
was Demetri Martin, but--"

553
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:33,040
I mean, he's hauling ass right now.

554
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:42,520
So you guys were watching
a spider come down,

555
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:45,680
and you didn't tell me.

556
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:48,360
- We didn't wanna interrupt.
- Didn't want to interrupt?

557
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:53,720
There was a spider
coming down.

558
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:56,160
Let me put it this way.

559
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:58,920
If there's ever a spider

560
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:01,960
coming down on top of me

561
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:04,720
during my show

562
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:10,360
when I'm talking about all
the deadly diseases I had...

563
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:14,880
Interrupt my show.

564
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:19,840
I don't want
to be bitten by a spider

565
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:23,960
'cause God knows Jenny Slate
is gonna wanna have tea.

566
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:36,880
I was so into Van Halen as a kid.

567
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:40,440
<i>And, um, like,</i>
<i>I loved Eddie Van Halen.</i>

568
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:45,000
<i>I just--to this day,</i>
<i>I still just really enjoy him.</i>

569
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:47,480
<i>Any time he played guitar,</i>
<i>I was just like,</i>

570
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:50,720
<i>"Oh, my gosh."</i>
<i>And I played soccer.</i>

571
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:54,960
<i>And I would be outside</i>
<i>just juggling the soccer ball</i>

572
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:57,080
<i>for hours, just going at it.</i>

573
00:35:57,240 --> 00:36:00,960
<i>And there was-- there</i>
<i>was woods right by my house.</i>

574
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:04,480
<i>I would make up that Eddie Van Halen</i>

575
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:08,080
<i>heard I was out</i>
<i>juggling the soccer ball</i>

576
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:12,120
<i>and, uh,</i>

577
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:15,960
<i>would just appear out of the woods,</i>

578
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:18,520
<i>not to where</i>
<i>I could totally see him,</i>

579
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:21,080
<i>but he'd lean against a tree.</i>

580
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:23,240
<i>And just in my head, he was like,</i>

581
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:25,960
<i>"You're doing</i>
<i>a great job, kid."</i>

582
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:31,920
So that means that Van Halen
was on their tour bus...

583
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:37,880
<i>Driving along,</i>
<i>and Eddie was just like,</i>

584
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:42,240
<i>"Guys, there's this little girl</i>

585
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:45,120
<i>"in Spring, Texas,</i>

586
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:48,400
<i>"juggling a soccer ball</i>

587
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:50,320
<i>"for hours on end.</i>

588
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:52,920
<i>"We need to pull off the route here</i>

589
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:57,480
<i>and swing by, and I just need</i>
<i>to check how she's doing."</i>

590
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:03,400
<i>And there he was, every time</i>
<i>I juggled a soccer ball.</i>

591
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:07,320
<i>I never looked 'cause I didn't</i>
<i>wanna scare him away.</i>

592
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:10,360
<i>I was just like, "I know</i>
<i>you're back there, Eddie.</i>

593
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:13,920
<i>I know you think I'm great."</i>

594
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:22,000
All right, that's not worth sharing.

595
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:24,800
You don't have
to share everything, Tig.

596
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:33,400
I was thinking about my life

597
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:39,040
<i>and how I identify with being cool.</i>

598
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:41,240
I am a cool person.

599
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:44,680
That is what gets me through,
is being cool.

600
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:49,280
<i>I smoked from the time</i>
<i>I was, like, four</i>

601
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:50,960
<i>until I was 25.</i>

602
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:52,960
<i>So, you know, that's kinda tough.</i>

603
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:57,480
<i>And I kind of had this total</i>
<i>Fonzarelli vibe about me.</i>

604
00:38:57,640 --> 00:39:00,800
<i>But as a kid,</i>
<i>in many times in my life,</i>

605
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:03,160
<i>I have blown my cool,</i>

606
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:05,920
<i>where I'm just, like, out there</i>

607
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:08,920
<i>trying to be</i>
<i>an interesting little person,</i>

608
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:12,320
<i>and then, boom, blow my cool.</i>

609
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:14,200
<i>My friend lived on a farm,</i>

610
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:16,440
<i>and she asked me</i>
<i>if I wanted to come over</i>

611
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:20,520
<i>and ride motorcycles</i>
<i>out in the pasture with her.</i>

612
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:22,440
<i>"Uh, yeah.</i>

613
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:27,480
<i>"If I'm not doing it at your place,</i>
<i>I'm doing it at mine."</i>

614
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:37,320
<i>I have seen people ride motorcycles.</i>

615
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:40,560
<i>It's not that hard.</i>

616
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:44,120
<i>Yeah, I'll be over</i>
<i>to ride motorcycles</i>

617
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:46,520
<i>through your pasture.</i>

618
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:49,120
<i>I got over to her house,</i>

619
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:52,960
<i>and they were just, like,</i>
<i>little tiny motorcycles.</i>

620
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:54,840
<i>And in my head,</i>

621
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,520
<i>before I got over there,</i>
<i>it was like,</i>

622
00:39:56,680 --> 00:39:58,120
<i>"Yeah, I know how to ride</i>
<i>a motorcycle."</i>

623
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:00,760
<i>And then as I was getting</i>
<i>closer to it, I was thinking,</i>

624
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:05,040
<i>"Oh, my God, I don't know</i>
<i>how to ride a motorcycle."</i>

625
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:08,320
<i>And it was just a minibike,</i>

626
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:11,240
<i>which wasn't as complicated,</i>
<i>I guess,</i>

627
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:15,240
<i>but I put it in gear</i>

628
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:18,480
<i>and gunned it.</i>

629
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:20,680
<i>And you know that reckless,</i>
<i>horrible feeling</i>

630
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:23,640
<i>where you're going over</i>
<i>a bump and into a hole</i>

631
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:28,600
<i>and over a bump and</i>
<i>there is no control over it?</i>

632
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:33,400
<i>And then I slammed into the fence.</i>

633
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:41,400
<i>And I was in so much pain.</i>

634
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:44,440
<i>But I was so cool</i>

635
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:47,160
<i>that I couldn't even reveal</i>

636
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:50,880
<i>that I wanted my mommy.</i>

637
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:53,960
<i>Fonzarelli wanted her mommy.</i>

638
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:56,680
<i>I was just like, "Ohh."</i>

639
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:59,800
<i>And I was still</i>
<i>regularly wetting my pants</i>

640
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:02,920
<i>at that point in my life.</i>

641
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:09,040
<i>Blowing my cool constantly.</i>

642
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:14,440
<i>Just a horseshoe of urine</i>
<i>all the time.</i>

643
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:21,960
<i>"I don't have time</i>
<i>to use a toilet."</i>

644
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:25,560
<i>I am riding motorcycles</i>

645
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:28,440
<i>through pastures--</i>

646
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:30,920
<i>horseshoe of urine.</i>

647
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:34,200
<i>Do you know what I would do</i>
<i>to cover that up?</i>

648
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:36,960
<i>I'd go sit in a puddle.</i>

649
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:42,080
<i>Really, I-- the world was my toilet.</i>

650
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:45,120
<i>Anything was fine.</i>

651
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:48,640
<i>A bed?</i>
<i>Sure.</i>

652
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:51,760
<i>A friend spent the night.</i>
<i>I woke up.</i>

653
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:55,120
<i>They were covered in my urine,</i>

654
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:58,160
<i>sleeping like a baby.</i>

655
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:04,960
<i>I woke up my friend.</i>
<i>I was like, "I am so sorry.</i>

656
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:06,920
<i>"My cat...</i>

657
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:11,840
<i>"She always does this.</i>

658
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:15,080
<i>This is gross.</i>
<i>This is gross."</i>

659
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:23,000
<i>There was another time</i>
<i>I blew my cool.</i>

660
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:25,880
<i>I play guitar.</i>

661
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:31,280
<i>And I was kinda known in my school</i>

662
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:33,120
<i>for being pretty amazing</i>

663
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:37,120
<i>even though nobody had seen me play.</i>

664
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:38,920
<i>And there was a talent show,</i>

665
00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:44,080
<i>and this girl asked me if</i>
<i>I would play a song with her.</i>

666
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:47,920
<i>And, uh, I was like,</i>
<i>"Yeah.</i>

667
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:51,000
<i>You came to the right one."</i>

668
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:57,000
<i>So we rehearsed, I guess,</i>
<i>one time at her house,</i>

669
00:42:57,160 --> 00:43:01,400
<i>and I can't really remember</i>
<i>what that was like.</i>

670
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:04,920
<i>I don't imagine it went that well</i>

671
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:09,200
<i>because show day,</i>
<i>we were introduced,</i>

672
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:10,840
<i>we come out onstage,</i>

673
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,920
<i>she's playing piano,</i>
<i>and she's singing,</i>

674
00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:16,320
<i>and I'm up there,</i>
<i>you know, in my head.</i>

675
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:19,720
<i>I was just Eddie Van Halen.</i>

676
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:24,400
<i>About three strums in,</i>

677
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:27,280
<i>I forgot all of the chords.</i>

678
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:31,600
<i>There was even a guitar solo</i>
<i>I was supposed to go into,</i>

679
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:34,200
<i>and none of that happened.</i>

680
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:36,720
<i>So at the talent show,</i>

681
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:40,960
<i>it was just the girl playing piano</i>

682
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:45,720
<i>and me standing there</i>

683
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:48,840
<i>with my guitar on...</i>

684
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:54,360
<i>For four minutes.</i>

685
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:56,040
<i>It went absolutely nowhere,</i>

686
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:58,320
<i>and I remember her</i>
<i>looking back at me like,</i>

687
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:01,440
<i>"You know,</i>
<i>you can pick up anywhere."</i>

688
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:03,720
<i>"Mm-mm.</i>

689
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,560
<i>"No, I cannot.</i>

690
00:44:07,720 --> 00:44:12,480
<i>I'll just stand here while</i>
<i>you finish out the song."</i>

691
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:18,000
<i>Just a guitar</i>

692
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:21,240
<i>right there around my neck.</i>

693
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:23,440
<i>I mean, I'm sure</i>
<i>it went around my back,</i>

694
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:28,880
<i>not, like, around my neck</i>
<i>like a complete nerd.</i>

695
00:44:31,120 --> 00:44:33,760
The worst day of my life.

696
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:39,000
Let's end with a fun story,
shall we?

697
00:44:39,160 --> 00:44:41,200
<i>No way.</i>

698
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:48,440
<i>I went-- I went on the road,</i>

699
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:52,280
<i>on tour, a few years ago</i>
<i>with some friends of mine.</i>

700
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:54,960
<i>And we brought--</i>

701
00:44:55,120 --> 00:44:56,800
<i>you know, it was--</i>
<i>it was a few years ago.</i>

702
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:59,800
<i>We brought our favorite CDs, and--</i>

703
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:02,880
<i>does that ever happen anymore?</i>

704
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:07,400
Well, I brought
Dolly Parton's "Greatest Hits."

705
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:11,760
Yeah. That's right.

706
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:16,240
<i>She is beyond a national treasure.</i>
<i>She's an international treasure.</i>

707
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:19,240
<i>She's just a precious person.</i>

708
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:22,640
And, I mean, who-- it's like,
who doesn't like Dolly Parton?

709
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:26,720
Every now and then-- okay.
Who doesn't like Dolly Parton?

710
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:28,640
Clap if you don't like Dolly Parton.

711
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:32,560
Okay, psychopath right there.

712
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:35,960
That's the only answer.
To not like Dolly Parton,

713
00:45:36,120 --> 00:45:39,200
it's just like there's
a psychopath in the room.

714
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:44,720
<i>So we're listening</i>
<i>to Dolly Parton's "Greatest Hits."</i>

715
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:46,760
<i>Then this song--</i>

716
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:49,560
<i>one of her songs is called,</i>
<i>"Three Doors Down."</i>

717
00:45:49,720 --> 00:45:52,160
<i>It's so good.</i>

718
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:54,720
<i>It is so Dolly, okay?</i>

719
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:58,160
<i>It is the Dolly</i>
<i>we know and love, okay?</i>

720
00:45:58,320 --> 00:46:01,080
- Did I say "Three Doors Down"?
- Yeah.

721
00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:04,240
That's not a Dolly Parton song.

722
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:06,080
I think that's a band.

723
00:46:07,720 --> 00:46:10,640
"Two Doors Down." Dolly Parton's song
is "Two Doors Down."

724
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:12,600
I promise I'm a fan of hers.

725
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:17,520
<i>It's really, really a great song.</i>
<i>And I asked my friends,</i>

726
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:20,640
<i>I said, "Hey, do you mind if we listen</i>
<i>to that song again?"</i>

727
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:22,440
<i>And they're like, "Okay."</i>
<i>They play it.</i>

728
00:46:22,600 --> 00:46:24,000
<i>And then I was like,</i>
<i>"You know what?"</i>

729
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:25,960
<i>And they kind of</i>
<i>came around to it, like,</i>

730
00:46:26,120 --> 00:46:29,000
<i>"Yeah, this is a really good song.</i>
<i>It's so fun."</i>

731
00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:33,440
<i>And so I just said, "Why don't</i>
<i>we just put it on repeat?"</i>

732
00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:38,120
<i>So we did, and we must've listened</i>
<i>to it, like, 30 times.</i>

733
00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:41,680
All right, let me tell this
story from the beginning.

734
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:45,200
<i>I'm flying down the road with</i>
<i>my friends Martha and Steve.</i>

735
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:51,360
<i>We're listening to the song</i>
<i>over and over.</i>

736
00:46:56,120 --> 00:46:58,280
<i>We were smiling.</i>
<i>We were glad.</i>

737
00:46:58,440 --> 00:47:01,360
<i>We were having a blast.</i>

738
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:03,800
<i>You haven't seen a happier group.</i>

739
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:10,440
<i>And then...</i>

740
00:47:12,600 --> 00:47:13,960
<i>There's this part of the song</i>

741
00:47:14,120 --> 00:47:19,320
<i>where the-- the song slows down a bit</i>
<i>and hits a minor key.</i>

742
00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:24,480
<i>And I started to imagine a reality</i>

743
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:26,760
<i>where things maybe</i>
<i>weren't so fun anymore.</i>

744
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:32,560
<i>I started to imagine we were</i>
<i>losing control of the car,</i>

745
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:35,480
<i>just sliding off the road.</i>

746
00:47:35,640 --> 00:47:39,320
<i>The car starts</i>
<i>flipping sideways, longways.</i>

747
00:47:42,600 --> 00:47:44,160
<i>The car's upside down.</i>

748
00:47:56,000 --> 00:48:00,200
<i>Then, in this alternative reality,</i>
<i>we come to a crashing halt,</i>

749
00:48:00,360 --> 00:48:02,920
<i>all three of us</i>
<i>gurgling on our own blood,</i>

750
00:48:03,080 --> 00:48:08,680
<i>watching each other die</i>
<i>slow, painful, imaginary deaths.</i>

751
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:12,800
<i>But if you remember, it's on repeat.</i>

752
00:48:29,600 --> 00:48:31,200
<i>Thank you.</i>
<i>Good night.</i>
