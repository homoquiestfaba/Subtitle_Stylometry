534
00:21:27,453 --> 00:21:28,619
- Oh!

535
00:21:28,688 --> 00:21:30,421
- This is probably
the craziest thing

536
00:21:30,490 --> 00:21:32,323
that has ever happened
to me in my life.

537
00:21:32,392 --> 00:21:35,860
- This is the best surprise
of my entire life.

538
00:21:35,928 --> 00:21:37,895
- Did I fool you?
[kids clamoring]

539
00:21:37,964 --> 00:21:39,297
- This is the best day
of my life.

540
00:21:39,365 --> 00:21:41,399
<i>John Cena's my idol.</i>

541
00:21:41,467 --> 00:21:43,301
I'm just so shocked right now.

542
00:21:43,369 --> 00:21:45,469
[kids shouting]

543
00:21:45,538 --> 00:21:49,006
[all cheering]

544
00:21:49,075 --> 00:21:53,077
<i>- And that's it for our
top ten wildest moments.</i>

545
00:21:53,146 --> 00:21:54,111
<i>But...</i>

546
00:21:56,516 --> 00:22:00,117
<i>You won't want to miss it
when we are back in session.</i>
