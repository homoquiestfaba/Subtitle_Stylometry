1
00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:15,485
<i>Thank you! Thank you!</i>

2
00:00:15,610 --> 00:00:18,490
<i>Oh, my gosh. Thank you so much.</i>

3
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:22,245
<i>Thank you. Thank you.</i>

4
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:26,625
<i>Aw, thank you so much. Thank you.</i>

5
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:29,175
<i>Aw… That's so nice.</i>

6
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:32,840
<i>That almost makes me forget
we're all gonna be dead in a week.</i>

7
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,550
<i>I'm kidding. It'll probably be a month.</i>

8
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:41,390
<i>Remember when we thought
the pandemic was over?</i>

9
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:43,685
<i>Everyone was so happy.</i>

10
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:46,100
<i>"We did it!"</i>

11
00:00:47,270 --> 00:00:50,070
<i>We probably looked so stupid.</i>

12
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:52,945
<i>Everyone was patting themselves
on the back.</i>

13
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:55,115
<i>"You know, I'm just glad
I could help out the sick,</i>

14
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:56,530
<i>by staying inside."</i>

15
00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:01,580
<i>"It's not over?
Well, I'm not going back in."</i>

16
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:04,960
<i>"Those sick people have to die."</i>

17
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:08,295
<i>'Cause it's not over.</i>

18
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:12,045
<i>The pandemic is like a TV show
you thought was canceled,</i>

19
00:01:12,170 --> 00:01:14,510
<i>and then it got picked up by Netflix.</i>

20
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:17,010
<i>Oh…</i>

21
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:25,480
<i>I didn't really pace myself
for another season.</i>

22
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:31,190
<i>I don't know about you, I wasn't
planning on seeing my family ever again.</i>

23
00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:34,235
<i>Parents know the feeling.</i>

24
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:37,405
<i>It's like changing that diaper
in the middle of the night.</i>

25
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:40,655
<i>You're exhausted. It's disgusting.</i>

26
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:41,865
<i>But you have to do it.</i>

27
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:45,375
<i>So you change the diaper,
you finally get the sleeper back on,</i>

28
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:48,625
<i>and as you gently lay the baby
back in the crib,</i>

29
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:50,840
<i>you hear the diaper fill up again.</i>

30
00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:55,010
<i>And that's what the year 2021 is.</i>

31
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:59,390
<i>Over and over.</i>

32
00:02:03,010 --> 00:02:06,310
<i>It's just a diaper filling up
over and over.</i>

33
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:11,025
<i>I kind of miss the early days
of the pandemic.</i>

34
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:12,145
<i>Those were fun.</i>

35
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:15,070
<i>Back when we thought washing our hands
would protect us.</i>

36
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:18,655
<i>"Everyone, wash your hands.
We'll be fine."</i>

37
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:20,410
<i>"Okay."</i>

38
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:25,455
<i>Remember before
there were readily available tests,</i>

39
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:29,045
<i>everyone had that friend that used
to brag "Yeah, I already had COVID."</i>

40
00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:31,380
<i>"I had it back in '91."</i>

41
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:36,010
<i>"Yeah. Back then, it
was called COVID-91."</i>

42
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:40,550
<i>"Had it a couple times.
Got rid of it by washing my hands."</i>

43
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:44,385
<i>'Cause the symptoms were confusing.</i>

44
00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:45,975
<i>They're still confusing.</i>

45
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:47,605
<i>It's like, "What are the symptoms?"</i>

46
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:48,810
<i>"Everything."</i>

47
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,985
<i>"What do you mean, everything?"</i>

48
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:55,400
<i>"Asking a question is a symptom."</i>

49
00:02:57,820 --> 00:03:00,240
<i>"Well, that can't be true."</i>

50
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:03,120
<i>"Denial is a major symptom."</i>

51
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:09,665
<i>Did you wipe down your groceries?
I did that.</i>

52
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:11,045
<i>It felt so silly.</i>

53
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:14,500
<i>You know, like, "I'm just a normal guy
cleaning a Triscuit box."</i>

54
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:23,050
<i>"Is this what OCD feels like?"</i>

55
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:28,440
<i>Couple weeks later, you're like,
"Nah, they look clean to me."</i>

56
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:30,940
<i>"I cleaned 'em."</i>

57
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:34,235
<i>But you had to take the precautions.</i>

58
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:37,525
<i>There was no uniformity.
Everyone talked a big game, right?</i>

59
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:38,905
<i>"Oh, we're on lockdown."</i>

60
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:40,525
<i>"No work, no school, you know."</i>

61
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:41,945
<i>"We got our bubble."</i>

62
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:44,615
<i>"Bubble's just my family
and these two people we see</i>

63
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:46,080
<i>at a weekly sex party."</i>

64
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:50,500
<i>"I figured, better safe than sorry."</i>

65
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:54,755
<i>'Cause we all went through
the same pandemic,</i>

66
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:57,585
<i>but we didn't have
the same experience, right?</i>

67
00:03:57,710 --> 00:03:58,715
<i>There were factors.</i>

68
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,585
<i>Like, if you were 25 and healthy,</i>

69
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:03,590
<i>you're like, "Whatever.
I'm going on a COVID cruise."</i>

70
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:07,385
<i>But if you were over the age of 25...</i>

71
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:09,310
<i>And it may surprise you, but I am…</i>

72
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:13,105
<i>…you watched the
news more closely, right?</i>

73
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:16,105
<i>The news guys would be like,
"High-risk people are older."</i>

74
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:18,770
<i>You're like, "Well, how old?"</i>

75
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,565
<i>"Like old old,</i>

76
00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:23,490
<i>or didn't-have-a-cellphone-
in-high-school old?"</i>

77
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:26,950
<i>Right?</i>

78
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:33,910
<i>'Cause nobody thinks
of themselves as old.</i>

79
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:39,630
<i>The reality of your age just
occasionally slaps you across the face.</i>

80
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:43,675
<i>I did this benefit for a hospital.
It was a fancy event.</i>

81
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:46,015
<i>When I showed up,
the woman running the event was like,</i>

82
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:49,475
<i>"Oh, my gosh.
We went to the same college."</i>

83
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,765
<i>She was younger, but we talked</i>

84
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:53,435
<i>and we realized we hung out
at the same places.</i>

85
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:56,145
<i>At the end of the event,
I was leaving and she ran up to me,</i>

86
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:59,105
<i>she was like, "I need to know
what year you graduated college."</i>

87
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:00,985
<i>I was like, "1988."</i>

88
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:04,060
<i>And she was like, "Oh, my gosh.
That's the year I was born."</i>

89
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:07,030
<i>Slap!</i>

90
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:10,330
<i>Right across the face.</i>

91
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:12,115
<i>I didn't even know what to say.</i>

92
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:15,120
<i>I was like,
"Ah, that's the year I was born too."</i>

93
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:19,335
<i>She looked at me like,
"That's not funny."</i>

94
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:21,505
<i>And then I got in my car
and stuffed food in my mouth</i>

95
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:23,280
<i>until I stopped feeling anything.</i>

96
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:29,845
<i>Sometimes you had to decipher
the news. Right?</i>

97
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:31,055
<i>The newscaster would be like,</i>

98
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:34,765
<i>"The vulnerable are
older and people with comorbidities."</i>

99
00:05:34,890 --> 00:05:36,600
<i>You're like, "Co what?"</i>

100
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:38,775
<i>"Comorbidity."</i>

101
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:41,645
<i>Which eventually we figured out
was just code for,</i>

102
00:05:41,770 --> 00:05:43,860
<i>"All the fat asses are gonna die."</i>

103
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:48,200
<i>But they couldn't say that on the news.</i>

104
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:50,615
<i>They couldn't have Sanjay Gupta be like,</i>

105
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:53,790
<i>"Well, Anderson,
all the fat asses are gonna die."</i>

106
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:58,455
<i>So they said comorbidities.</i>

107
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:00,875
<i>And at home, we were like,
"Honey, what is a comorb..."</i>

108
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,550
<i>"I don't know. Pass the gravy."</i>

109
00:06:05,170 --> 00:06:08,965
<i>In time, we figured out
they were talking about fat people.</i>

110
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:12,760
<i>And if you were overweight,
you were like, "How fat?"</i>

111
00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:17,850
<i>Or like, "Are we talking Walmart fat
or Jim Gaffigan fat?"</i>

112
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:25,655
<i>I got the message.</i>

113
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:27,945
<i>I dunno, I totally got the message.
I started working out.</i>

114
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:29,655
<i>I started eating healthy.
I was going good.</i>

115
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:33,380
<i>Then one day I looked in the mirror
and I was like, "Ah, enough of that."</i>

116
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:37,220
<i>Turns out, life or death, not the
motivator you'd think it would be.</i>

117
00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:39,705
<i>"You could live longer."</i>

118
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:41,180
<i>"Not a good enough reason."</i>

119
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:44,960
<i>"Can you sweeten the deal,
maybe throw in a pizza?"</i>

120
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:48,005
<i>I tried. I tried.</i>

121
00:06:48,130 --> 00:06:49,845
<i>My wife bought me a scale,</i>

122
00:06:49,970 --> 00:06:51,890
<i>so the romance is still alive.</i>

123
00:06:54,010 --> 00:06:57,460
<i>I didn't ask for it. She gave it to
me as a gift.</i>

124
00:06:58,390 --> 00:06:59,975
<i>I could never do something like that.</i>

125
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:03,560
<i>"Happy birthday, honey.
I bought you a scale and some makeup."</i>

126
00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:07,410
<i>"Just lookin' out for you, sweetie."</i>

127
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:10,275
<i>It's a high-tech scale.</i>

128
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:13,820
<i>Comes with an app so the government
can know how overweight I am.</i>

129
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:18,035
<i>I don't know why there's an app.</i>

130
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,910
<i>Maybe so I can be the victim
of Ransomware.</i>

131
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:25,090
<i>"Pay up or we're
telling everyone how fat you are."</i>

132
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,710
<i>"But I don't have any crypto currency."</i>

133
00:07:31,090 --> 00:07:33,305
<i>I set up the app, stood on the scale,</i>

134
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:36,510
<i>my weight showed up on the phone,
150 pounds.</i>

135
00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:40,810
<i>All right, it was over 200.</i>

136
00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:44,645
<i>All right, it was way over 200.</i>

137
00:07:44,770 --> 00:07:48,150
<i>If it was an old-fashioned scale,
you wouldn't see the number 200.</i>

138
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,820
<i>But it was in the 200 family.</i>

139
00:07:52,910 --> 00:07:55,075
<i>And underneath my weight, on the phone,</i>

140
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:58,035
<i>there was this word
in small red lettering.</i>

141
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,125
<i>I didn't have my glasses on
so I asked my daughter.</i>

142
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:03,000
<i>I was like, "What does that say?"
She was like, "Obese."</i>

143
00:08:04,210 --> 00:08:07,500
<i>Slap! Right across the face.</i>

144
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:12,010
<i>I just looked at my daughter,
I'm like, "Ah, I gotta update this app."</i>

145
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:16,055
<i>And then I ran to the kitchen
and stuffed food in my mouth</i>

146
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:17,780
<i>till I stopped feeling anything.</i>

147
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:25,605
<i>Still wearing masks.</i>

148
00:08:25,730 --> 00:08:28,355
<i>There was that time
when nobody had to wear a mask, right?</i>

149
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:29,530
<i>That was a fun day.</i>

150
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:35,825
<i>Remember the first time you went out
in public without a mask?</i>

151
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:37,195
<i>It was weird, right?</i>

152
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:40,490
<i>You felt naked.
You were like, "Oh, I'm so European."</i>

153
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,080
<i>"What is this, the French Riviera?"</i>

154
00:08:46,210 --> 00:08:49,040
<i>I was kind of tempted to wear,
like, a thong mask.</i>

155
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:53,220
<i>You know, something
tasteful yet naughty.</i>

156
00:08:54,170 --> 00:08:56,890
<i>"I can see his cheeks,
but there's still a mystery."</i>

157
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:00,390
<i>"Ooh-la-la."</i>

158
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:04,185
<i>♪ Round and pale and mostly balding ♪</i>

159
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:07,475
<i>♪ The boy from Indiana goes walking ♪</i>

160
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:11,605
<i>♪ And as he does
All the people he pass go ♪</i>

161
00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:12,780
<i>♪ "Yuck!" ♪</i>

162
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:19,155
<i>Initially, it was strange seeing
other people's faces without a mask.</i>

163
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:22,930
<i>You wanted to go up to some people like,
"You should stick with the mask."</i>

164
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:26,920
<i>"It's a better look for you.
You in a mask is better for everyone."</i>

165
00:09:28,130 --> 00:09:32,465
<i>Did you meet anyone during the pandemic
where you only knew them with a mask?</i>

166
00:09:32,590 --> 00:09:34,965
<i>And then when you finally
saw them barefaced,</i>

167
00:09:35,090 --> 00:09:36,630
<i>you're like, "Yikes."</i>

168
00:09:38,090 --> 00:09:39,345
<i>You felt like you were catfished.</i>

169
00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:42,520
<i>You're like, "Wow, your face
doesn't match your voice at all."</i>

170
00:09:43,270 --> 00:09:44,810
<i>"And who stole your chin?"</i>

171
00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:50,895
<i>Of course, the biggest reveal
of the pandemic</i>

172
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:53,940
<i>was how many crazy people there are.</i>

173
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:56,655
<i>That was a bit of a surprise.</i>

174
00:09:56,780 --> 00:09:59,825
<i>We all knew there were
some Unabombers out there, but,</i>

175
00:09:59,950 --> 00:10:01,780
<i>nobody thought there were that many.</i>

176
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:05,620
<i>Or that we were related
to a couple of them.</i>

177
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:08,290
<i>You know?</i>

178
00:10:14,590 --> 00:10:17,385
<i>'Cause everyone had
that relative or friend</i>

179
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:19,640
<i>that came out as bonkers.</i>

180
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:23,010
<i>"I no longer believe in reality."</i>

181
00:10:24,930 --> 00:10:26,140
<i>"Good to know."</i>

182
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:30,190
<i>It was like a gender
reveal for insanity.</i>

183
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:34,485
<i>"The truth is no longer true."</i>

184
00:10:34,610 --> 00:10:35,940
<i>"See you at Thanksgiving."</i>

185
00:10:37,690 --> 00:10:39,485
<i>I feel like it happened
for me more often</i>

186
00:10:39,610 --> 00:10:42,825
<i>'cause I've always had friends
that are eccentric thinkers</i>

187
00:10:42,950 --> 00:10:44,705
<i>and they're normally
really entertaining.</i>

188
00:10:44,830 --> 00:10:48,955
<i>They're like,
"Bigfoot's real, man. Bigfoot is real."</i>

189
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:52,205
<i>But that same person, at one point
during the pandemic, was like,</i>

190
00:10:52,330 --> 00:10:54,500
<i>"Tom Hanks eats babies."</i>

191
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:00,175
<i>"Don't say that."</i>

192
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:01,965
<i>"Tom Hanks does eat babies."</i>

193
00:11:02,090 --> 00:11:04,930
<i>"And if you don't believe that,
then you eat babies."</i>

194
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:07,600
<i>"All right."</i>

195
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,310
<i>"Tom Hanks eats babies."</i>

196
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:13,690
<i>"He always seemed
like a baby-eater to me."</i>

197
00:11:16,070 --> 00:11:19,655
<i>The thing I missed most
during the lockdown was restaurants.</i>

198
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:21,150
<i>I know that's a surprise.</i>

199
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:24,535
<i>I didn't even realize
how much I missed restaurants</i>

200
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:26,615
<i>'til the first time I went out to eat</i>

201
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:29,710
<i>and I caught myself catcalling
other people's food.</i>

202
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:33,250
<i>"Oh, yeah."</i>

203
00:11:35,210 --> 00:11:37,250
<i>"What I would do to you."</i>

204
00:11:39,050 --> 00:11:40,970
<i>"Get me a fork and knife."</i>

205
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:44,510
<i>"Jim, you're in public."
"Oh, sorry."</i>

206
00:11:48,970 --> 00:11:50,685
<i>This is gonna kind of sound pandering,</i>

207
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:54,775
<i>but I believe the pandemic
has been hardest on mothers.</i>

208
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:57,855
<i>Definitely hardest on mothers. Right?</i>

209
00:11:57,980 --> 00:12:01,450
<i>Or the men who had to live
with those mothers.</i>

210
00:12:03,570 --> 00:12:06,195
<i>It was insane for...
I don't know how my wife did it.</i>

211
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:09,495
<i>We had five children
doing distance-learning.</i>

212
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:10,625
<i>And my kids were good.</i>

213
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:12,910
<i>They totally kept a distance
from learning.</i>

214
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:18,715
<i>We asked children to do school</i>

215
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:22,010
<i>on the same device they play Minecraft .</i>

216
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:25,515
<i>It's like holding
a Weight Watchers meeting</i>

217
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:27,140
<i>in a Wendy's.</i>

218
00:12:29,430 --> 00:12:31,310
<i>I mean, it was insane.</i>

219
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:39,525
<i>I definitely gained an appreciation</i>

220
00:12:39,650 --> 00:12:42,115
<i>for how difficult it is to be a teacher.</i>

221
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:45,410
<i>And what a poor career choice that was.</i>

222
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:49,160
<i>Right?</i>

223
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:53,750
<i>I guess it was, uh, after the first case
of Scotch, I turned to my wife…</i>

224
00:12:55,670 --> 00:12:59,045
<i>…and I said, "When this is over,
if there's even an opening,</i>

225
00:12:59,170 --> 00:13:01,585
<i>I'll take you wherever you wanna go.
Wherever you wanna go."</i>

226
00:13:01,710 --> 00:13:03,795
<i>My wife was like,
"I want to go to Hawaii."</i>

227
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:06,520
<i>And I was like,
"I was thinking more Tri-State area."</i>

228
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:11,515
<i>She was like, "I wanna go to Hawaii
and I wanna bring the kids."</i>

229
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:13,480
<i>And I was like, "Whose kids?"</i>

230
00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:17,065
<i>She was like, "Our kids."</i>

231
00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:19,695
<i>I did the research,
saw that it was cheaper than a divorce,</i>

232
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:21,070
<i>so we went to Hawaii.</i>

233
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:24,240
<i>And…</i>

234
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:30,575
<i>Hawaii is such a special place.
It really is.</i>

235
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:32,615
<i>It's like there's the "Aloha Spirit",</i>

236
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:35,585
<i>where people greet each other
with "Aloha," but I'm so awkward,</i>

237
00:13:35,710 --> 00:13:38,750
<i>so they'll be like, "Aloha,"
and I'll be like, "Hello ha."</i>

238
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:42,335
<i>Does that mean something? That means…</i>

239
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:45,135
<i>Even when I would use
the Hawaiian terms properly,</i>

240
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:46,255
<i>it would backfire.</i>

241
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:48,805
<i>Like if I said, "Mahalo,"
the natives would look at me like,</i>

242
00:13:48,930 --> 00:13:51,515
<i>"You don't have to do that."</i>

243
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:53,890
<i>"Just nod your head
and we'll bring you pork."</i>

244
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:56,685
<i>'Cause I stuck out in Hawaii.</i>

245
00:13:56,810 --> 00:13:58,475
<i>I didn't even look like a tourist.</i>

246
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:00,235
<i>I looked like someone they brought in</i>

247
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:02,480
<i>to make the tourists feel
more comfortable.</i>

248
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:07,070
<i>"You're fine. You wanna see awkward,
look at Jim Gaffigan."</i>

249
00:14:09,410 --> 00:14:12,405
<i>Hawaii, it's incomparable
to any other state.</i>

250
00:14:12,530 --> 00:14:14,325
<i>It's a tropical paradise.</i>

251
00:14:14,450 --> 00:14:18,125
<i>It's almost like Hawaii
was this Polynesian island nation</i>

252
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:19,625
<i>that we just took over.</i>

253
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:21,205
<i>You know what I mean?</i>

254
00:14:21,330 --> 00:14:23,215
<i>Like, it wasn't even part
of the United States.</i>

255
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:25,175
<i>We just went in like
it was an open house.</i>

256
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:27,380
<i>"Nice. Nice."</i>

257
00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:30,890
<i>"We could do our honeymoon here.
We'll take it."</i>

258
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:34,015
<i>The Hawaiians were like,
"We're our own country."</i>

259
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:37,240
<i>"That's cute. I love your flower shirt.
Gotta get one of them."</i>

260
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:41,775
<i>And Hawaiians will tell you,
they'll come right up to you.</i>

261
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:43,195
<i>They'll be, "You stole this land."</i>

262
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:47,120
<i>And I'm like, "Don't know how to break
it to you, but we stole all the land."</i>

263
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:51,780
<i>"Probably just stings a little more
'cause it's pretty here."</i>

264
00:14:53,950 --> 00:14:56,660
<i>"Believe me, there's people in Detroit
pissed at us."</i>

265
00:14:58,870 --> 00:15:01,295
<i>My wife chose Hawaii
because my wife loves the beach.</i>

266
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:03,460
<i>And as you can see, so do I.</i>

267
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:09,590
<i>I spent the entire time applying
and re-applying sunscreen</i>

268
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:13,090
<i>which, thankfully, makes my skin whiter.</i>

269
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:18,185
<i>What cruel bastard decided</i>

270
00:15:18,310 --> 00:15:22,025
<i>that the goo that protects
pale people from the sun</i>

271
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:25,360
<i>should also make them look
like White Walkers?</i>

272
00:15:26,690 --> 00:15:28,655
<i>It's… it's just cruel.</i>

273
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:30,905
<i>They should offer other colors.</i>

274
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:33,620
<i>"Cool. There's one of the guys
from Blue Man Group."</i>

275
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:38,785
<i>I don't even know why sunscreen
is white. What was the thinking?</i>

276
00:15:38,910 --> 00:15:42,420
<i>"Well, you know, those pale people
love ranch dressing, so…"</i>

277
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:45,880
<i>"…let's keep it in their wheelhouse."</i>

278
00:15:47,590 --> 00:15:49,925
<i>'Cause I don't tan. I don't kind of tan.</i>

279
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:52,050
<i>There's no medium rare for me.</i>

280
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,345
<i>I either look
like I've never been outside,</i>

281
00:15:55,470 --> 00:15:58,010
<i>or I was just released from a burn unit.</i>

282
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:01,270
<i>There's no in-between.</i>

283
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,605
<i>And I know people go
to the beach to relax.</i>

284
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:06,485
<i>People find the beach very relaxing.</i>

285
00:16:06,610 --> 00:16:07,820
<i>Not so much for me.</i>

286
00:16:08,530 --> 00:16:10,445
<i>It's like being allergic to bees</i>

287
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:13,280
<i>and then, for vacation,
becoming a beekeeper.</i>

288
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:17,205
<i>My one goal was to just not burn.</i>

289
00:16:17,330 --> 00:16:19,495
<i>I didn't want to be the sunburned adult.</i>

290
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:21,995
<i>You see a kid with a sunburn,
you're like, "Parenting is hard."</i>

291
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:23,995
<i>You see an adult with a sunburn,
you're like,</i>

292
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:25,415
<i>"That's an alcoholic."</i>

293
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:27,875
<i>Right?</i>

294
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,050
<i>'Cause…</i>

295
00:16:31,170 --> 00:16:33,755
<i>A sunburn on an adult</i>

296
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:36,135
<i>is like a scarlet letter</i>

297
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:37,720
<i>for poor judgment.</i>

298
00:16:38,810 --> 00:16:40,305
<i>There is no excuse.</i>

299
00:16:40,430 --> 00:16:42,810
<i>"Well, I was caught
off-guard this time."</i>

300
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:48,120
<i>"I didn't know the fireball in the sky
would be hot this time."</i>

301
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:55,325
<i>When we weren't
at the beach, we did activities.</i>

302
00:16:55,450 --> 00:16:57,870
<i>I went zip-lining for the last time.</i>

303
00:16:59,490 --> 00:17:02,035
<i>What is wrong with us?</i>

304
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,460
<i>"Hey, you wanna feel like
you're about to die?"</i>

305
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:09,040
<i>"Would you pay 200 dollars to feel like
you're about to die six times?"</i>

306
00:17:09,790 --> 00:17:12,420
<i>Why don't you just walk into traffic?</i>

307
00:17:13,590 --> 00:17:16,260
<i>"Did you see that bus almost hit me?
I feel so alive."</i>

308
00:17:18,390 --> 00:17:21,015
<i>Why don't you just take off your mask
at a biker rally?</i>

309
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:22,930
<i>You know?</i>

310
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:32,605
<i>If you've been zip-lining,
you know to slow down,</i>

311
00:17:32,730 --> 00:17:34,485
<i>you have to spread
out your arms and legs.</i>

312
00:17:34,610 --> 00:17:35,775
<i>That supposedly slows you down.</i>

313
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:37,860
<i>It also makes it look like a suicide.</i>

314
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:42,620
<i>"Oh, if he didn't wanna die,
why was he doing the chalk outline?"</i>

315
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:47,335
<i>It's such a weird... How did they
even come up with zip-lining?</i>

316
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:50,630
<i>"Hey, you know how telephone
poles have a wire between 'em?"</i>

317
00:17:51,210 --> 00:17:53,360
<i>"What if we just put the tourists
up there?"</i>

318
00:17:55,550 --> 00:17:56,715
<i>"Why would tourists do that?"</i>

319
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:59,590
<i>"Don't know.
Why would they pay to swim with sharks?"</i>

320
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:02,635
<i>We did go snorkeling.</i>

321
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:04,055
<i>I wasn't worried for myself</i>

322
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:06,435
<i>'cause I figured sharks would look
at my legs and be like,</i>

323
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:07,770
<i>"Those can't be real."</i>

324
00:18:09,770 --> 00:18:13,360
<i>"I'm not gonna bite into
another mannequin, that's for sure."</i>

325
00:18:17,570 --> 00:18:20,115
<i>Sometimes, when my family
would go to the beach,</i>

326
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,995
<i>I'd go for a hike by myself,</i>

327
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:24,325
<i>which was boring,
but I figured how to make it fun.</i>

328
00:18:24,450 --> 00:18:26,915
<i>I started bringing a ketchup packet,</i>

329
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:29,545
<i>and halfway through the hike,
I'd open up the ketchup packet</i>

330
00:18:29,670 --> 00:18:31,375
<i>and rub it on my hands and my face,</i>

331
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:34,000
<i>then I'd just approach romantic couples.</i>

332
00:18:35,550 --> 00:18:37,090
<i>"Have you seen my wife?"</i>

333
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:41,430
<i>"No."</i>

334
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:44,510
<i>"But you heard her
sassing off to me, right?"</i>

335
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,440
<i>"I can still smell her sin."</i>

336
00:18:51,350 --> 00:18:53,400
<i>"Jim, that joke's scary."</i>

337
00:18:54,570 --> 00:18:56,690
<i>"That's a scary joke."</i>

338
00:18:58,650 --> 00:19:00,655
<i>The pandemic continues, but we're…</i>

339
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:02,995
<i>we're also processing part
of the pandemic.</i>

340
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:05,415
<i>We went a year and a half
with no weddings,</i>

341
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:08,495
<i>no kids' birthday parties,
no family reunions,</i>

342
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:10,370
<i>but it wasn't all good news.</i>

343
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:13,795
<i>Right?</i>

344
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:18,335
<i>Right? Huh?</i>

345
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:21,425
<i>Some things... I don't think
some things are coming back.</i>

346
00:19:21,550 --> 00:19:24,850
<i>Like parades. I think that might
be a wrap on parades.</i>

347
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:30,355
<i>There was never anything
that impressive about a parade.</i>

348
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:33,690
<i>You're all like, "Hey, kids, look.
People are… walking."</i>

349
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:38,440
<i>"Creating unnecessary traffic."</i>

350
00:19:39,990 --> 00:19:42,485
<i>Before the pandemic,
if you ran into a parade,</i>

351
00:19:42,610 --> 00:19:45,155
<i>you were never like,
"Oh, cool, a parade."</i>

352
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:47,580
<i>You were always kind of like,
"I hate humans."</i>

353
00:19:48,910 --> 00:19:51,375
<i>The only people really
enjoying the parade</i>

354
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:53,670
<i>were the people marching in the parade.</i>

355
00:19:54,290 --> 00:19:57,590
<i>Even the people on the sidewalk
were like, "How long is this?"</i>

356
00:19:59,010 --> 00:20:01,045
<i>Of course, the highlight of most parades</i>

357
00:20:01,170 --> 00:20:03,130
<i>is the marching band, right?</i>

358
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:06,805
<i>And on TV, that bird's-eye view
of the marching band</i>

359
00:20:06,930 --> 00:20:08,515
<i>is so impressive, right?</i>

360
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,435
<i>But on a street level,
you always felt like</i>

361
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:12,560
<i>you were being invaded by nerds.</i>

362
00:20:13,730 --> 00:20:16,560
<i>"Uh-oh. Here they come. Hide your Xbox."</i>

363
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:20,315
<i>But marching bands are amazing, right?</i>

364
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:22,615
<i>They practice as much as the athletes.</i>

365
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:24,075
<i>They're always rehearsing.</i>

366
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:27,075
<i>It's amazing how much effort goes
into creating something</i>

367
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,740
<i>that no one really likes.</i>

368
00:20:31,870 --> 00:20:33,080
<i>I'm kidding.</i>

369
00:20:35,210 --> 00:20:37,585
<i>I know there's some
marching band people here and it…</i>

370
00:20:37,710 --> 00:20:40,045
<i>And then for those... You know, like...</i>

371
00:20:40,170 --> 00:20:43,045
<i>The reality is,
a marching band can take a song...</i>

372
00:20:43,170 --> 00:20:45,095
<i>It's pretty impressive... any song,</i>

373
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:46,260
<i>and ruin it.</i>

374
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:55,310
<i>You know, like, "Wow, I didn't know
I could hate 'Uptown Funk' that much."</i>

375
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:59,945
<i>You're never listening to a song
and think,</i>

376
00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:02,570
<i>"I wish there was
a marching band version of this."</i>

377
00:21:06,490 --> 00:21:09,705
<i>And I understand there's
some proud marching band people here.</i>

378
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:12,875
<i>And in full disclosure,
I could never be in a marching band</i>

379
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,580
<i>'cause I've had sex.</i>

380
00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:27,390
<i>"He's… He's gonna get beat up
by a marching band."</i>

381
00:21:28,590 --> 00:21:32,265
<i>No, I know that people cherish their
time in the marching band, they do.</i>

382
00:21:32,390 --> 00:21:36,645
<i>But to me, it just seems like
we're dissuading careers in music.</i>

383
00:21:36,770 --> 00:21:38,645
<i>It's like, "Oh, you wanna be
a musician? Okay."</i>

384
00:21:38,770 --> 00:21:40,650
<i>"Put on this Captain Crunch costume."</i>

385
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:45,820
<i>"At halftime, march around the field
while we grab some hot dogs."</i>

386
00:21:47,070 --> 00:21:48,445
<i>"Do that for a couple semesters,</i>

387
00:21:48,570 --> 00:21:50,970
<i>then we'll see
if you still wanna be a musician."</i>

388
00:21:53,830 --> 00:21:57,125
<i>Did you know that...? I didn't know this.
Marching bands started as military bands.</i>

389
00:21:57,250 --> 00:22:00,215
<i>They would march armies into battle,</i>

390
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:03,335
<i>and they were for morale
and to intimidate the enemy.</i>

391
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:05,210
<i>I don't know how that would work.</i>

392
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:08,800
<i>"Oh, no. They know Fleetwood Mac."</i>

393
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:12,475
<i>"Should we go back?"</i>

394
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:15,390
<i>"What if Lindsey
Buckingham is with them?"</i>

395
00:22:16,730 --> 00:22:21,520
<i>How did they convince someone
playing a trumpet to march into battle…</i>

396
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:23,730
<i>"Head on in there."</i>

397
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,575
<i>"Won't they have weapons?"</i>

398
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:29,610
<i>"You're gonna fight them with music."</i>

399
00:22:31,910 --> 00:22:34,790
<i>"If you survive, please wake us up
in the morning with a…"</i>

400
00:22:42,130 --> 00:22:45,920
<i>I love it when trumpet players
have the plunger at the end.</i>

401
00:22:50,010 --> 00:22:51,095
<i>Who came up with that?</i>

402
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:53,135
<i>"You know, I was listening to you
play the trumpet</i>

403
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:56,220
<i>and it reminded me
of when I clogged my toilet."</i>

404
00:22:57,890 --> 00:23:00,395
<i>"I'd eaten six Big Macs
on a dare, anyway."</i>

405
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:03,855
<i>"Uh, I brought my plunger.
It's kind of clean."</i>

406
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:07,615
<i>"If you could place it at the end
of your expensive music equipment,</i>

407
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:09,610
<i>and give me a 'wah-wah.'"</i>

408
00:23:11,110 --> 00:23:12,160
<i>"Go ahead."</i>

409
00:23:15,990 --> 00:23:18,240
<i>"Have you ever thought
of becoming a plumber?"</i>

410
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:23,080
<i>It's ridiculous.</i>

411
00:23:24,130 --> 00:23:26,755
<i>People always know someone
who looks like me.</i>

412
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:29,715
<i>Wherever I go, once a week,
someone will come up to me and go,</i>

413
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:32,095
<i>"Hey, I know someone
that looks like you."</i>

414
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:34,570
<i>I never know what to say.
"Well, tell him 'Hi.'"</i>

415
00:23:37,310 --> 00:23:39,140
<i>"Encourage them to wear sunscreen."</i>

416
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:43,105
<i>And this person who looks like me</i>

417
00:23:43,230 --> 00:23:45,770
<i>never doing something impressive
with their life.</i>

418
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:48,280
<i>"Yeah, he mows our lawn."</i>

419
00:23:50,450 --> 00:23:52,530
<i>"We don't even pay
him. He just does it."</i>

420
00:23:54,570 --> 00:23:56,950
<i>That sounds like my gene pool.</i>

421
00:23:57,540 --> 00:24:02,335
<i>Occasionally, on social media,
I'll be sent photos of babies</i>

422
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:04,210
<i>who supposedly look like me.</i>

423
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:07,670
<i>"This baby looks like Jim Gaffigan."</i>

424
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:09,925
<i>People think it's hysterical</i>

425
00:24:10,050 --> 00:24:13,300
<i>that I look like a pale,
pudgy, bald infant</i>

426
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:16,220
<i>who poops in a diaper.</i>

427
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:18,845
<i>Sometimes, people get too cute.</i>

428
00:24:18,970 --> 00:24:22,015
<i>They're like, "Hey, why does
our baby son look like Jim Gaffigan?"</i>

429
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:24,240
<i>I'm like, "'Cause I
slept with your wife."</i>

430
00:24:30,690 --> 00:24:34,945
<i>Now if you think it's humiliating
to be told you look like a baby,</i>

431
00:24:35,070 --> 00:24:39,615
<i>you should know I've also been
sent photos of cats that supposedly…</i>

432
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:41,915
<i>…look like me.</i>

433
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:46,375
<i>Not once or twice, we're talking
about dozens of different cats.</i>

434
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:47,715
<i>Always the same message.</i>

435
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:50,630
<i>"This cat looks like Jim Gaffigan."</i>

436
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:54,595
<i>I don't know what they're implying,
you know.</i>

437
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:57,050
<i>That I fathered a cat out of wedlock?</i>

438
00:24:58,510 --> 00:25:01,720
<i>When I was lonely after a show
so I went for a walk and…</i>

439
00:25:02,890 --> 00:25:04,810
<i>an alley cat asked
for a cigarette and…</i>

440
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:07,940
<i>I said I don't smoke and…</i>

441
00:25:08,810 --> 00:25:10,440
<i>well, we started talking and…</i>

442
00:25:11,730 --> 00:25:13,860
<i>before you know it,
the sun was coming up.</i>

443
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:17,990
<i>I never saw that cat again.</i>

444
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:22,290
<i>I can still smell her dander.</i>

445
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:27,625
<i>Now, if you think it's humiliating</i>

446
00:25:27,750 --> 00:25:31,300
<i>to be told you look
like a baby or a cat,</i>

447
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:37,390
<i>you should know I was once sent a photo
of someone's kneecap…</i>

448
00:25:40,470 --> 00:25:45,810
<i>…with the message,
"This kneecap looks like Jim Gaffigan."</i>

449
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:51,820
<i>- And you know what?
- I did look like that kneecap.</i>

450
00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:56,075
<i>But I don't know
what they were implying, you know.</i>

451
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:58,860
<i>That I fathered a
kneecap out of wedlock?</i>

452
00:26:00,490 --> 00:26:02,540
<i>That I was lonely after a show and…</i>

453
00:26:03,950 --> 00:26:07,120
<i>I went for a walk and a kneecap asked
for a cigarette and…</i>

454
00:26:07,830 --> 00:26:09,460
<i>and I said I don't smoke and…</i>

455
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:11,750
<i>we started talking.</i>

456
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:15,480
<i>Before you know it,
the sun was coming up.</i>

457
00:26:17,630 --> 00:26:19,590
<i>I never saw that kneecap again.</i>

458
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:23,470
<i>Now, if you think it's humiliating…</i>

459
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:31,270
<i>…to be told you look like the fleshy,
wrinkly part of a stranger's leg…</i>

460
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:33,860
<i>it is.</i>

461
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:38,945
<i>Or, uh, you know, I thought it was.
And then I had this realization.</i>

462
00:26:39,070 --> 00:26:41,905
<i>I figured out what had happened.</i>

463
00:26:42,030 --> 00:26:43,205
<i>You know, it all made sense.</i>

464
00:26:43,330 --> 00:26:45,825
<i>There might be one person in here
that's like, "Jim, you're crazy."</i>

465
00:26:45,950 --> 00:26:48,500
<i>But I think the rest of you
will see the logic here.</i>

466
00:26:49,670 --> 00:26:56,300
<i>What happened is, this kneecap person,
obviously, went to a plastic surgeon…</i>

467
00:26:57,800 --> 00:27:01,930
<i>Right? And said, "I
would like my kneecap</i>

468
00:27:02,510 --> 00:27:06,180
<i>to look like the most
underrated comedian in America."</i>

469
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:11,315
<i>Right? And the plastic surgeon said,</i>

470
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:12,730
<i>"You mean John Mulaney?"</i>

471
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:19,280
<i>And the kneecap person said,
"No, Jim Gaffigan."</i>

472
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:22,870
<i>And the plastic surgeon said,
"I don't know who that is."</i>

473
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:26,830
<i>And then the kneecap person said,</i>

474
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:31,790
<i>"He's kind of a pale, pudgy guy
who looks like a baby or a cat."</i>

475
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,540
<i>That's probably what happened.</i>

476
00:27:37,590 --> 00:27:38,965
<i>That's weird.</i>

477
00:27:39,090 --> 00:27:43,430
<i>I normally get told I look like
other humans though. I, uh…</i>

478
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:47,395
<i>In Utah, I always get
told I look Mormon.</i>

479
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:50,020
<i>I didn't even know
you could look like a religion.</i>

480
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:53,065
<i>But apparently, I do.
And I've done research.</i>

481
00:27:53,190 --> 00:27:55,525
<i>I don't look like one of the founders
of the Mormons.</i>

482
00:27:55,650 --> 00:27:58,275
<i>I don't look like a present leader
of the Mormons.</i>

483
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:01,500
<i>I don't even look like a guy
who could have more than one wife.</i>

484
00:28:03,990 --> 00:28:06,200
<i>I just somehow look Mormon.</i>

485
00:28:07,330 --> 00:28:09,825
<i>Of course, the Mormons
no longer practice polygamy.</i>

486
00:28:09,950 --> 00:28:13,625
<i>But for a while there, a Mormon man
could have more than one wife.</i>

487
00:28:13,750 --> 00:28:15,800
<i>I don't know if that
was a selling point.</i>

488
00:28:16,750 --> 00:28:21,170
<i>'Cause I love my wife, and I can
honestly say I don't want another one.</i>

489
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:26,890
<i>I feel like disappointing one person
is enough.</i>

490
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:32,230
<i>Could you imagine
having two spouses mad at you?</i>

491
00:28:33,270 --> 00:28:35,400
<i>And you couldn't drink coffee?</i>

492
00:28:37,190 --> 00:28:38,355
<i>No, thanks.</i>

493
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:41,025
<i>I hope it doesn't sound like
I'm picking on Mormons.</i>

494
00:28:41,150 --> 00:28:44,285
<i>Most organized religions
have negative stereotypes.</i>

495
00:28:44,410 --> 00:28:47,990
<i>Luckily, I'm Catholic, so I don't have
to worry about that, all right.</i>

496
00:28:54,420 --> 00:28:56,915
<i>Sometimes people don't believe me.
Like, "Are you really Catholic?"</i>

497
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:59,250
<i>"No, I'm just saying
that to impress you."</i>

498
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:03,340
<i>"I wanna come across like
I have good judgment."</i>

499
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:07,975
<i>At this point, it's almost like
Catholics are trying to lose followers.</i>

500
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:10,805
<i>They're like, "What else can we do?
What else?"</i>

501
00:29:10,930 --> 00:29:14,230
<i>"Why don't we make Bill Cosby pope?
Let's try that."</i>

502
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:19,605
<i>Catholics have made an art
of shrinking their religion.</i>

503
00:29:19,730 --> 00:29:23,615
<i>Even back to the Great Schism of 1054
where the Eastern Orthodox</i>

504
00:29:23,740 --> 00:29:25,525
<i>and the Roman Catholics split apart,</i>

505
00:29:25,650 --> 00:29:28,615
<i>the Orthodox were like, "We wanna
celebrate Christmas in January."</i>

506
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:31,240
<i>And the Catholics were like,
"We like pedophiles."</i>

507
00:29:33,540 --> 00:29:35,460
<i>I know. That one's hard for me too.</i>

508
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:40,165
<i>And then there was
the, uh, Protestant Reformation.</i>

509
00:29:40,290 --> 00:29:43,390
<i>You didn't even know this is a
religion history class, did you?</i>

510
00:29:44,090 --> 00:29:46,845
<i>No, there was the Protestant Reformation
in the 1500s</i>

511
00:29:46,970 --> 00:29:51,140
<i>when Martin Luther, who probably thought
he'd be the most famous Martin Luther…</i>

512
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:56,770
<i>Right? He was like, "That's it.
I'm the king of Martin Luthers."</i>

513
00:29:58,190 --> 00:30:01,020
<i>"Don't be surprised if one day,
I get my own holiday."</i>

514
00:30:02,610 --> 00:30:05,485
<i>No, Martin Luther,
he had those 95 problems,</i>

515
00:30:05,610 --> 00:30:08,030
<i>but a bitch ain't one, right?</i>

516
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:13,115
<i>'Cause at the time,
the Catholic church was super corrupt.</i>

517
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:14,790
<i>Thankfully, it's not anymore.</i>

518
00:30:16,790 --> 00:30:18,455
<i>Some Catholics get really angry.</i>

519
00:30:18,580 --> 00:30:21,545
<i>"You're so critical of Catholic church,
why you even Catholic?"</i>

520
00:30:21,670 --> 00:30:24,335
<i>Because I believe human beings
are inherently flawed.</i>

521
00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:25,845
<i>That's one of the reasons.</i>

522
00:30:25,970 --> 00:30:28,505
<i>But mainly, I'm afraid of my wife.</i>

523
00:30:28,630 --> 00:30:31,975
<i>Huh?</i>

524
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:34,685
<i>I don't think there's anything
intrinsically wrong</i>

525
00:30:34,810 --> 00:30:36,105
<i>with organized religion.</i>

526
00:30:36,230 --> 00:30:39,605
<i>It's just the human
interpretation, right?</i>

527
00:30:39,730 --> 00:30:42,485
<i>Most organized religions,
God's saying a similar thing.</i>

528
00:30:42,610 --> 00:30:44,735
<i>He's like,
"I want you to love one another."</i>

529
00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:48,990
<i>And the humans are like, "Got it,
got it. He said kill gay people, so…"</i>

530
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,580
<i>"Let's get to work."</i>

531
00:30:54,450 --> 00:30:58,035
<i>As a result, all organized religions
are struggling right now.</i>

532
00:30:58,160 --> 00:30:59,915
<i>Muslims, they're killing it.</i>

533
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:03,085
<i>Muslims are like, "Oh, Catholics,
you think you can alienate people?"</i>

534
00:31:03,210 --> 00:31:04,840
<i>"Hold my hummus."</i>

535
00:31:06,380 --> 00:31:08,220
<i>"Let me show you how it's done."</i>

536
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:10,385
<i>i'm sure some of you
are looking at me like,</i>

537
00:31:10,510 --> 00:31:13,100
<i>"Hey, Jim, you look like
a former Hitler Youth."</i>

538
00:31:15,350 --> 00:31:17,470
<i>"What are your views on Judaism?"</i>

539
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:20,980
<i>"I'd like to see you destroy
your career tonight."</i>

540
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:26,025
<i>Well, I'm not frightened.
I'll tell you what I think.</i>

541
00:31:26,150 --> 00:31:28,690
<i>I think Judaism is perfect.</i>

542
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:34,330
<i>There's nothing wrong with it. And
I'd like to be in more feature films.</i>

543
00:31:37,870 --> 00:31:38,910
<i>That's…</i>

544
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:42,370
<i>That's some, uh…</i>

545
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:47,710
<i>That's some good old-fashioned
pandering anti-Semitism.</i>

546
00:31:49,130 --> 00:31:51,055
<i>Really, the only organized religion,</i>

547
00:31:51,180 --> 00:31:53,715
<i>without a negative stereotype,
is Buddhism.</i>

548
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:56,845
<i>Right? You'd think more Americans
would be Buddhists.</i>

549
00:31:56,970 --> 00:32:00,180
<i>'Cause if you look at Buddha,
he kind of looks like an American.</i>

550
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:05,110
<i>Buddha looks like someone
you'd watch the game with.</i>

551
00:32:06,190 --> 00:32:08,860
<i>"Buddha always gets
a keg for the playoffs."</i>

552
00:32:09,990 --> 00:32:12,070
<i>"Buddha! Buddha!"</i>

553
00:32:14,530 --> 00:32:17,825
<i>You know, in real life, Buddha was thin.
He wasn't even a big guy.</i>

554
00:32:17,950 --> 00:32:20,835
<i>They made him heavy
to make the religion more appealing.</i>

555
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:23,875
<i>'Cause at that time,
being heavy was a sign of success.</i>

556
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,125
<i>Also at that time, being lighter-skinned
was a sign of success.</i>

557
00:32:27,250 --> 00:32:31,510
<i>So back then,
I would have been like Jeff Bezos, so…</i>

558
00:32:34,470 --> 00:32:38,720
<i>Bezos. Who's your favorite
billionaire-pretend astronaut?</i>

559
00:32:40,350 --> 00:32:41,600
<i>Hmm?</i>

560
00:32:42,230 --> 00:32:44,310
<i>Can you believe there's a choice?</i>

561
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:48,440
<i>And it's not between just two.</i>

562
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:54,365
<i>We live in a day when billionaires
are building their own rockets</i>

563
00:32:54,490 --> 00:32:57,745
<i>to fly to outer space,
and no one's saying,</i>

564
00:32:57,870 --> 00:33:00,490
<i>"Are you sure they're paying
all their taxes?"</i>

565
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:04,750
<i>"'Cause I know some teachers
that need supplies."</i>

566
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:16,345
<i>It's like these billionaires are trying
to execute the plan</i>

567
00:33:16,470 --> 00:33:18,010
<i>of a five-year-old boy.</i>

568
00:33:19,010 --> 00:33:22,020
<i>"When I grow up,
I'm gonna be a bazillionaire!"</i>

569
00:33:23,270 --> 00:33:25,480
<i>"And I'm gonna build my own spaceship!"</i>

570
00:33:26,770 --> 00:33:29,190
<i>"And fly to outer space!"</i>

571
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:32,030
<i>"Okay, Jeffrey."</i>

572
00:33:33,530 --> 00:33:35,650
<i>"But now it's time for bed."</i>

573
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:40,785
<i>I almost feel sorry for the accountants
of the billionaires.</i>

574
00:33:40,910 --> 00:33:42,785
<i>'Cause they were like,
"You had an amazing year."</i>

575
00:33:42,910 --> 00:33:44,915
<i>"You made 40 billion dollars."</i>

576
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:47,940
<i>"But I fudged the numbers
so it looks like you broke even."</i>

577
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:51,295
<i>"As long as you lay low
and don't draw attention,</i>

578
00:33:51,420 --> 00:33:52,550
<i>we should be fine."</i>

579
00:33:54,380 --> 00:33:55,830
<i>"You got anything coming up?"</i>

580
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:59,675
<i>"I built a rocket…"</i>

581
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:02,060
<i>"…to fly to outer space."</i>

582
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:10,980
<i>"You know I meant to lay low
on this planet."</i>

583
00:34:12,730 --> 00:34:15,900
<i>"Does it matter
if the rocket's shaped like a penis?"</i>

584
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:28,835
<i>I do enjoy the reasoning
of the billionaires for going to space.</i>

585
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:34,510
<i>They're like, "I'm going to outer space
so eventually</i> you</i><i> can go to outer space."</i>

586
00:34:35,590 --> 00:34:37,170
<i>"I'm going so you can go."</i>

587
00:34:38,090 --> 00:34:39,800
<i>"I don't wanna go to outer space."</i>

588
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:42,970
<i>"I wanna go to Italy."</i>

589
00:34:45,930 --> 00:34:47,310
<i>Why don't you work on that?</i>

590
00:34:49,940 --> 00:34:53,485
<i>I saw a hitchhiker recently.
You never see that anymore.</i>

591
00:34:53,610 --> 00:34:55,815
<i>Of course, we no longer
refer to them as "hitchhikers."</i>

592
00:34:55,940 --> 00:34:57,950
<i>Now we call them "murderers".</i>

593
00:34:59,990 --> 00:35:04,285
<i>Which is what they do. They murder
the nice people that give them rides.</i>

594
00:35:04,410 --> 00:35:06,495
<i>Talk about a lack of gratitude.</i>

595
00:35:06,620 --> 00:35:08,660
<i>"Thanks for picking me up." Stab.</i>

596
00:35:11,130 --> 00:35:14,215
<i>Hitchhiking disappeared 'cause
it was dangerous for both participants.</i>

597
00:35:14,340 --> 00:35:16,295
<i>Right? The hitchhiker and the driver.</i>

598
00:35:16,420 --> 00:35:18,755
<i>And, you know, at one point,
there must have been like</i>

599
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:21,635
<i>a murderer driving around
looking to pick up a hitchhiker,</i>

600
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:24,680
<i>and he picked up a hitchhiker
who was also a murderer.</i>

601
00:35:25,930 --> 00:35:27,645
<i>And the driver was like,
"I'm gonna kill you."</i>

602
00:35:27,770 --> 00:35:30,230
<i>And the hitchhiker was like,
"I'm gonna kill you."</i>

603
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:33,520
<i>And I bet they had a laugh.</i>

604
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:37,780
<i>I bet they laughed.</i>

605
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:41,700
<i>And then slowly but surely,
"they fell in love."</i>

606
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:45,010
<i>"And that's what my musical's about."</i>

607
00:35:46,910 --> 00:35:48,960
<i>It's called Hitched.</i>

608
00:35:52,710 --> 00:35:55,625
<i>Flew in Thursday,
uh, driving from the airport,</i>

609
00:35:55,750 --> 00:35:58,710
<i>I saw this guy on a motorcycle
and he looked so happy.</i>

610
00:35:59,380 --> 00:36:02,805
<i>You know, and whenever I see a
motorcycle that's on the highway,</i>

611
00:36:02,930 --> 00:36:04,095
<i>I always have the same thought.</i>

612
00:36:04,220 --> 00:36:05,800
<i>"You're gonna die."</i>

613
00:36:07,810 --> 00:36:10,895
<i>"What are you doing on the highway?
You're gonna die."</i>

614
00:36:11,020 --> 00:36:14,350
<i>And the only reason I say that
is 'cause they're gonna die.</i>

615
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:17,645
<i>I don't even know what the thinking is.</i>

616
00:36:17,770 --> 00:36:19,985
<i>"Well, I have to
travel a long distance."</i>

617
00:36:20,110 --> 00:36:24,240
<i>"Should I take the car or this
motorized chair with no seat belt?"</i>

618
00:36:25,780 --> 00:36:27,950
<i>"If I sneeze, I'll never walk again."</i>

619
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:30,625
<i>"Live to ride."</i>

620
00:36:30,750 --> 00:36:32,580
<i>And then die!</i>

621
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:38,020
<i>I heard the motorcycle before I saw it.
We've all heard those loud motorcycles.</i>

622
00:36:39,710 --> 00:36:41,760
<i>"Wow, how small is his penis?"</i>

623
00:36:47,970 --> 00:36:51,015
<i>And I didn't know that's the reason
some motorcycles are so loud</i>

624
00:36:51,140 --> 00:36:54,140
<i>is 'cause they want you to know
they're gonna die.</i>

625
00:36:55,940 --> 00:36:58,065
<i>I have friends that love motorcycles.</i>

626
00:36:58,190 --> 00:36:59,945
<i>Some women are really into bikers.</i>

627
00:37:00,070 --> 00:37:01,905
<i>They're like,
"I just like a man who's dangerous,</i>

628
00:37:02,030 --> 00:37:03,530
<i>who can't afford a car."</i>

629
00:37:05,450 --> 00:37:07,200
<i>"And who's definitely gonna die."</i>

630
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:10,865
<i>But bikers are fascinating, right?</i>

631
00:37:10,990 --> 00:37:13,585
<i>What a uniquely American subculture.</i>

632
00:37:13,710 --> 00:37:16,505
<i>They're all about macho
independence, right?</i>

633
00:37:16,630 --> 00:37:20,465
<i>They're all about the independence.
Like, "I just wanna be out on the road,</i>

634
00:37:20,590 --> 00:37:23,215
<i>just me and my bike, alone,</i>

635
00:37:23,340 --> 00:37:25,380
<i>with 30 other guys."</i>

636
00:37:26,970 --> 00:37:28,720
<i>"In matching outfits."</i>

637
00:37:30,140 --> 00:37:33,350
<i>"Riding in tandem so close,
we can French-kiss each other."</i>

638
00:37:35,980 --> 00:37:39,820
<i>He's gonna get beat up by a
marching band and a gang of bikers.</i>

639
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:52,245
<i>Bikers are grown men who make the same
phone calls of an eight-year-old boy.</i>

640
00:37:52,370 --> 00:37:54,330
<i>"You guys wanna ride bikes tonight?"</i>

641
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:00,400
<i>"Well, I don't wanna go alone.
It's scary out there. Ask your mommy."</i>

642
00:38:06,510 --> 00:38:09,385
<i>The reason that's funny is 'cause bikers
are so intimidating, right?</i>

643
00:38:09,510 --> 00:38:10,765
<i>They're angry.</i>

644
00:38:10,890 --> 00:38:14,390
<i>Bikers seem angry,
and I think it's 'cause they're cold.</i>

645
00:38:15,730 --> 00:38:17,015
<i>Right?</i>

646
00:38:17,140 --> 00:38:19,810
<i>That vest with no shirt?
That's gotta be chilly.</i>

647
00:38:21,110 --> 00:38:23,480
<i>"Oh, I wish I had a shawl."</i>

648
00:38:26,110 --> 00:38:28,200
<i>"Shawl and my Uggs."</i>

649
00:38:29,870 --> 00:38:32,080
<i>"Maybe a pumpkin spice latte."</i>

650
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:36,745
<i>That vest with no shirt is so common
among bikers.</i>

651
00:38:36,870 --> 00:38:38,620
<i>Is there like peer pressure?</i>

652
00:38:39,750 --> 00:38:41,540
<i>"Look at Curtis over there,</i>

653
00:38:42,290 --> 00:38:46,510
<i>wearing a T-shirt under his vest
like a girl."</i>

654
00:38:48,590 --> 00:38:50,470
<i>"Let's kick his ass."</i>

655
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:53,220
<i>"And then kiss him."</i>

656
00:38:58,730 --> 00:39:00,725
<i>Occasionally, you'll see a biker
giving someone a ride</i>

657
00:39:00,850 --> 00:39:03,025
<i>on the back of their motorcycle,
it's usually a woman.</i>

658
00:39:03,150 --> 00:39:05,155
<i>Guys don't wanna ride on the back. Mm.</i>

659
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:07,775
<i>It's hard to get a ride
on the back of a motorcycle</i>

660
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:10,490
<i>without giving an extended intimate hug.</i>

661
00:39:11,870 --> 00:39:13,700
<i>"Let's get out of here, Virgil."</i>

662
00:39:19,790 --> 00:39:21,540
<i>"You smell wonderful, Virgil."</i>

663
00:39:22,790 --> 00:39:24,210
<i>"What is that, lilac?"</i>

664
00:39:26,590 --> 00:39:28,420
<i>"You've been doing sit-ups, Virgil?"</i>

665
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:38,105
<i>During the summer, occasionally,
you'll see a bicyclist on the highway.</i>

666
00:39:38,230 --> 00:39:39,515
<i>See a cyclist on the highway,</i>

667
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:43,485
<i>they're always dressed like they're
competing in the </i>Tour de France</i><i>.</i>

668
00:39:43,610 --> 00:39:44,900
<i>"You're losing!"</i>

669
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:48,280
<i>"And you're also gonna die."</i>

670
00:39:49,740 --> 00:39:53,115
<i>Those bicyclists, they have to
settle down with the helmet design.</i>

671
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:57,290
<i>It's all super aerodynamic.
It's like, "You're not going that fast."</i>

672
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:02,590
<i>You're riding a bike. You're not in
the movie </i>Tron</i><i>.</i>

673
00:40:03,380 --> 00:40:06,465
<i>And put on some clothes!</i>

674
00:40:06,590 --> 00:40:07,755
<i>What's with the spandex?</i>

675
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:10,420
<i>Are you on your way
to wrestle Blue Man Group?</i>

676
00:40:11,430 --> 00:40:14,340
<i>How many Blue Man references
you're gonna have?</i>

677
00:40:15,890 --> 00:40:18,435
<i>You ever see a bicyclist on the highway
and they're not in spandex,</i>

678
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:20,395
<i>they're just in regular clothes?</i>

679
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:22,190
<i>They look like they have a DUI.</i>

680
00:40:25,650 --> 00:40:26,900
<i>Should've Ubered.</i>

681
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:33,535
<i>You never see a cyclist
giving someone a ride, right?</i>

682
00:40:33,660 --> 00:40:35,115
<i>There's no room.</i>

683
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:37,890
<i>They're already sitting
on that door handle of a seat.</i>

684
00:40:38,450 --> 00:40:40,870
<i>"I'm just gonna sit
here for five hours."</i>

685
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:43,550
<i>"I don't know why I
can't have children."</i>

686
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:46,465
<i>Right, I'm going after the cyclist.</i>

687
00:40:46,590 --> 00:40:49,690
<i>What are they gonna do?
Throw their baby bottle of water at me?</i>

688
00:40:50,340 --> 00:40:54,220
<i>"I'd chase you, but for no reason
at all, I'm wearing cleats."</i>

689
00:41:05,060 --> 00:41:07,935
<i>Are those cleats necessary?</i>

690
00:41:08,060 --> 00:41:09,820
<i>You're in a Starbucks.</i>

691
00:41:12,610 --> 00:41:14,650
<i>"Do you have oat milk?"</i>

692
00:41:17,910 --> 00:41:21,665
<i>I think it's interesting, people who
ride bicycles are called "cyclists,"</i>

693
00:41:21,790 --> 00:41:25,290
<i>but people who ride motorcycles
are called "bikers"?</i>

694
00:41:26,710 --> 00:41:30,085
<i>You know, that's just the bikers
bullying the cyclists.</i>

695
00:41:30,210 --> 00:41:33,170
<i>"Hey, we're gonna take the name 'biker.'
You can't use it."</i>

696
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:37,425
<i>And the cyclist went, "Motorcycle
doesn't even have the word 'bike' in it."</i>

697
00:41:37,550 --> 00:41:38,890
<i>"We don't care."</i>

698
00:41:40,470 --> 00:41:43,620
<i>"Also, we're gonna dress like that guy
from the Village People."</i>

699
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:46,855
<i>Sun-glass guy's like,
"Well, we were gonna do that."</i>

700
00:41:46,980 --> 00:41:49,400
<i>"No, you're gonna dress like
rhythmic gymnasts."</i>

701
00:41:51,940 --> 00:41:54,650
<i>"Okay."</i>

702
00:41:57,990 --> 00:42:01,830
<i>Bikers and cyclists both dress like
they're on their way to a costume party.</i>

703
00:42:02,990 --> 00:42:06,120
<i>No other form of transportation
has a uniform.</i>

704
00:42:07,210 --> 00:42:10,250
<i>You never see everyone on
the cruise ship dress like pirates</i>

705
00:42:11,170 --> 00:42:12,750
<i>'cause it's not necessary.</i>

706
00:42:13,260 --> 00:42:16,135
<i>Bikers and cyclists, both on two wheels,
nothing in common.</i>

707
00:42:16,260 --> 00:42:18,055
<i>It's like they're
trying to be different.</i>

708
00:42:18,180 --> 00:42:19,845
<i>Even the placement of the handlebars…</i>

709
00:42:19,970 --> 00:42:21,685
<i>Some cyclists
have handlebars in real tight,</i>

710
00:42:21,810 --> 00:42:23,765
<i>some bikers have their handlebars
way up here.</i>

711
00:42:23,890 --> 00:42:25,270
<i>"Oh, this is comfortable."</i>

712
00:42:26,980 --> 00:42:28,770
<i>"This reminds me of my Big Wheel."</i>

713
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:33,400
<i>"Now I know why I have
my wallet on a chain."</i>

714
00:42:35,690 --> 00:42:37,790
<i>You never see a
unicyclist on the highway.</i>

715
00:42:38,780 --> 00:42:40,680
<i>You know why? 'Cause they're all dead.</i>

716
00:42:41,910 --> 00:42:43,950
<i>'Cause I killed them. You're welcome.</i>

717
00:42:45,290 --> 00:42:48,620
<i>Is there any bigger attention-grab
than riding a unicycle?</i>

718
00:42:49,460 --> 00:42:51,630
<i>I guess a pogo stick, right?</i>

719
00:42:54,250 --> 00:42:56,885
<i>What was the pitch for the pogo stick?</i>

720
00:42:57,010 --> 00:43:00,260
<i>"It's a stick you can jump on twice
and then fall on your face."</i>

721
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:05,515
<i>"Interesting. If you practice,
do you get better?"</i>

722
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:06,680
<i>"Not at all, no."</i>

723
00:43:08,350 --> 00:43:09,390
<i>"I'll take one."</i>

724
00:43:11,310 --> 00:43:15,155
<i>But unicyclists, they act like
they don't want the attention.</i>

725
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:17,695
<i>They always have that super casual look
on their face,</i>

726
00:43:17,820 --> 00:43:19,365
<i>but their legs are so frantic.</i>

727
00:43:19,490 --> 00:43:20,530
<i>They're always like…</i>

728
00:43:22,950 --> 00:43:26,290
<i>"Oh, hey, what's going on, everyone?"</i>

729
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:28,540
<i>"Oh, I'm not doing anything."</i>

730
00:43:29,790 --> 00:43:32,390
<i>"Does anyone have three bowling pins
I could juggle?"</i>

731
00:43:33,460 --> 00:43:35,840
<i>"I could annoy you
with two unnecessary skills."</i>

732
00:43:38,590 --> 00:43:40,680
<i>That joke takes way too much effort.</i>

733
00:43:43,300 --> 00:43:46,100
<i>Oh, you may have noticed
that there's a piano on stage.</i>

734
00:43:46,770 --> 00:43:48,305
<i>And, uh, some of you may be wondering,</i>

735
00:43:48,430 --> 00:43:52,650
<i>"Hey, why would Jim Gaffigan
have a piano on stage?"</i>

736
00:43:53,770 --> 00:43:54,810
<i>And…</i>

737
00:43:58,900 --> 00:44:02,950
<i>What you may not realize is that I…</i>

738
00:44:04,530 --> 00:44:05,830
<i>do not play the piano.</i>

739
00:44:08,620 --> 00:44:09,955
<i>"Jim, that was…"</i>

740
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:13,120
<i>"Really? Did he bring the piano
just for that joke?"</i>

741
00:44:15,170 --> 00:44:16,750
<i>"That's pathetic."</i>

742
00:44:19,010 --> 00:44:21,345
<i>Good-looking crowd here. Wow.</i>

743
00:44:21,470 --> 00:44:23,465
<i>Very good-looking.</i>

744
00:44:23,590 --> 00:44:25,800
<i>Very good-looking crowd, huh?</i>

745
00:44:27,430 --> 00:44:28,895
<i>Well, not all of you, you know.</i>

746
00:44:29,020 --> 00:44:30,435
<i>Not all of you.</i>

747
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:33,940
<i>But I'm not breaking any news, right?
We know where we stand.</i>

748
00:44:35,230 --> 00:44:38,065
<i>Yeah, we learn from such an early age.</i>

749
00:44:38,190 --> 00:44:41,525
<i>Like, I remember kindergarten, the girls
would chase the cute boys at recess,</i>

750
00:44:41,650 --> 00:44:44,070
<i>and let's just say I didn't do
a lot of running.</i>

751
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:47,450
<i>Or any running.</i>

752
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:49,995
<i>I remember being five
years old and going,</i>

753
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:52,040
<i>"Oh, this is how it's gonna be."</i>

754
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,670
<i>"I'm gonna have to write some jokes."</i>

755
00:44:57,090 --> 00:45:00,585
<i>"And I'll be hanging
out with the fellas."</i>

756
00:45:00,710 --> 00:45:02,635
<i>I still hang out with the fellas.</i>

757
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:04,805
<i>All right, I had a friend
during the lockdown</i>

758
00:45:04,930 --> 00:45:08,095
<i>who spent the entire time
planning a guys' weekend.</i>

759
00:45:08,220 --> 00:45:12,230
<i>Every time I talk to him, he
would make it sound less appealing.</i>

760
00:45:13,230 --> 00:45:14,605
<i>"Dude, this is what we're gonna do."</i>

761
00:45:14,730 --> 00:45:18,190
<i>"We're gonna rent a cabin for
the weekend. Just guys, no women."</i>

762
00:45:19,480 --> 00:45:20,530
<i>"I'm already out."</i>

763
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:26,575
<i>"No, no, no. Think about it.
Just guys, no women."</i>

764
00:45:26,700 --> 00:45:29,495
<i>"We'll smoke cigars,
play poker all weekend."</i>

765
00:45:29,620 --> 00:45:30,660
<i>"Sounds horrible."</i>

766
00:45:32,080 --> 00:45:33,455
<i>"You're not thinking it through."</i>

767
00:45:33,580 --> 00:45:37,920
<i>"Just guys, no women, for a
whole weekend, like we're in prison."</i>

768
00:45:41,170 --> 00:45:42,320
<i>"I look forward to it."</i>

769
00:45:44,130 --> 00:45:48,215
<i>Every year, my brother Mitch
goes on a golfing trip with 30 men.</i>

770
00:45:48,340 --> 00:45:50,015
<i>Thirty men. They fly to Florida.</i>

771
00:45:50,140 --> 00:45:52,555
<i>They rent three houses.
Ten men to a house.</i>

772
00:45:52,680 --> 00:45:54,975
<i>They play golf in the morning,
they eat lunch together,</i>

773
00:45:55,100 --> 00:45:57,975
<i>they play golf in the afternoon,
and then they go back to the houses,</i>

774
00:45:58,100 --> 00:46:00,050
<i>I don't know, have sex with each other.</i>

775
00:46:01,360 --> 00:46:03,610
<i>I don't know what they do.
It sounds horrible.</i>

776
00:46:04,690 --> 00:46:06,950
<i>How much fellowship can you have?</i>

777
00:46:09,320 --> 00:46:11,995
<i>My brother is not gay and,
obviously, I wouldn't care if he was.</i>

778
00:46:12,120 --> 00:46:16,750
<i>But if he ever came out, he could be
like, "I gave you so many hints."</i>

779
00:46:19,170 --> 00:46:21,920
<i>"I literally vacationed with 30 men."</i>

780
00:46:23,590 --> 00:46:26,010
<i>"We rented out a cul-de-sac."</i>

781
00:46:27,550 --> 00:46:30,930
<i>"We played with
sticks and balls all day."</i>

782
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:35,060
<i>"How clear did I have to make it?"</i>

783
00:46:36,100 --> 00:46:39,895
<i>I guess the point I'm trying to make
is golf makes people gay.</i>

784
00:46:40,020 --> 00:46:41,900
<i>So…</i>

785
00:46:47,740 --> 00:46:49,445
<i>So the next time a friend says,</i>

786
00:46:49,570 --> 00:46:53,410
<i>"I'm going to play golf with
the fellas," just be like, "Enjoy."</i>

787
00:46:56,750 --> 00:46:59,955
<i>No, I prefer mixed company.
I do, you know.</i>

788
00:47:00,080 --> 00:47:01,915
<i>There's a cliché that men are dumb</i>

789
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:05,420
<i>and I have enough male friends
to know that's based on some truth.</i>

790
00:47:06,970 --> 00:47:09,345
<i>Every man in here has that friend</i>

791
00:47:09,470 --> 00:47:13,470
<i>that they occasionally look at
and wonder how they hold down a job.</i>

792
00:47:15,180 --> 00:47:18,780
<i>And if you don't think that about
a friend, that means you're the friend.</i>

793
00:47:22,020 --> 00:47:23,110
<i>Yeah.</i>

794
00:47:25,110 --> 00:47:28,365
<i>My friend like that is Ricky.
He's a great guy.</i>

795
00:47:28,490 --> 00:47:30,695
<i>Ricky and I, one time,
we went axe-throwing.</i>

796
00:47:30,820 --> 00:47:33,195
<i>Don't know if you've done that.
Throw an axe, you drink a beer.</i>

797
00:47:33,320 --> 00:47:36,910
<i>You try and forget
our democracy is in crisis and…</i>

798
00:47:37,580 --> 00:47:39,915
<i>At one point,
Ricky turned to me and he goes,</i>

799
00:47:40,040 --> 00:47:44,040
<i>"Hey, before axe-throwing,
what did they use axes for?"</i>

800
00:47:49,300 --> 00:47:50,380
<i>"Uh…"</i>

801
00:47:51,130 --> 00:47:52,720
<i>"Chopping wood?"</i>

802
00:47:53,340 --> 00:47:56,680
<i>He's like, "Really?"
And I was like, "Don't talk anymore."</i>

803
00:47:59,140 --> 00:48:03,060
<i>And like a good friend, I ran home,
turned it into a stand-up bit.</i>

804
00:48:04,520 --> 00:48:05,815
<i>And I kind of forgot about it.</i>

805
00:48:05,940 --> 00:48:08,445
<i>Then, like a month later, Ricky
called me out of the blue and goes,</i>

806
00:48:08,570 --> 00:48:09,945
<i>"I did it. I did it."</i>

807
00:48:10,070 --> 00:48:13,325
<i>"I built my own axe-throwing range
in my backyard."</i>

808
00:48:13,450 --> 00:48:14,745
<i>Yeah, he's divorced.</i>

809
00:48:14,870 --> 00:48:17,245
<i>And…</i>

810
00:48:17,370 --> 00:48:19,285
<i>Then he immediately starts bragging.</i>

811
00:48:19,410 --> 00:48:23,335
<i>He's like, "Yeah, now, I could throw
an axe 20 yards and hit a bullseye."</i>

812
00:48:23,460 --> 00:48:24,625
<i>I'm like, "That's impressive."</i>

813
00:48:24,750 --> 00:48:27,250
<i>"You know when that's
gonna come in handy? Never."</i>

814
00:48:28,420 --> 00:48:31,570
<i>He'll be like, "Hey, you never know."
I'm like, "No, I do know."</i>

815
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:38,220
<i>Even if someone broke in your house
and you happen to be holding an axe,</i>

816
00:48:39,310 --> 00:48:42,660
<i>you're not gonna be able to say,
"Hey, can you come 10 feet closer?"</i>

817
00:48:48,020 --> 00:48:51,405
<i>I like having women around
for many reasons,</i>

818
00:48:51,530 --> 00:48:55,160
<i>not least of which is,
they're attractive and men are not.</i>

819
00:48:56,370 --> 00:48:57,575
<i>You know?</i>

820
00:48:57,700 --> 00:49:01,290
<i>Like when a guy's good-looking,
it's like a fluke of nature.</i>

821
00:49:02,080 --> 00:49:05,205
<i>And you know what
all attractive men have in common?</i>

822
00:49:05,330 --> 00:49:07,540
<i>They kind of look like women.</i>

823
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:10,420
<i>Right?</i>

824
00:49:13,380 --> 00:49:16,845
<i>That's the only way straight
guys can tell who's good-looking.</i>

825
00:49:16,970 --> 00:49:20,720
<i>"Wow, he must be attractive.
He barely looks like a dude."</i>

826
00:49:24,890 --> 00:49:29,315
<i>Women are attractive
and compared to men, they're very clean.</i>

827
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:30,820
<i>Men are gross.</i>

828
00:49:31,480 --> 00:49:34,615
<i>And make very little effort
to not be gross.</i>

829
00:49:34,740 --> 00:49:37,865
<i>Like, if aliens visited Earth,
they'll be so confused.</i>

830
00:49:37,990 --> 00:49:40,245
<i>They'll be like, "The attractive
feminine gender is taking</i>

831
00:49:40,370 --> 00:49:44,410
<i>an hour to get ready
and those hairy beasts are just ready?"</i>

832
00:49:46,120 --> 00:49:48,460
<i>"No wonder this planet's always at war."</i>

833
00:49:49,380 --> 00:49:52,920
<i>Men are gross
and as they get older, grosser.</i>

834
00:49:54,510 --> 00:49:56,345
<i>When women get older,
they become more elegant.</i>

835
00:49:56,470 --> 00:49:59,550
<i>As men get older,
they look like they're decomposing.</i>

836
00:50:01,350 --> 00:50:03,095
<i>You ever seen an old guy
with the shirt off?</i>

837
00:50:03,220 --> 00:50:05,310
<i>He looks like the
first draft of a human.</i>

838
00:50:07,020 --> 00:50:09,735
<i>What is that, a </i>Simpsons</i><i> character?</i>

839
00:50:09,860 --> 00:50:12,815
<i>Because when men get older,
things stop working.</i>

840
00:50:12,940 --> 00:50:14,695
<i>The synapses stop connecting.</i>

841
00:50:14,820 --> 00:50:17,735
<i>Normally, brain's like, "Every month,
I'm gonna grow hair on this guy's head.</i>

842
00:50:17,860 --> 00:50:19,995
<i>"Every month, I'm gonna grow hair
on this guy's head."</i>

843
00:50:20,120 --> 00:50:21,325
<i>But one month, the brain's like,</i>

844
00:50:21,450 --> 00:50:25,040
<i>"Every month, I'm gonna grow hair
everywhere but this guy's head."</i>

845
00:50:28,670 --> 00:50:30,710
<i>I have hair growing in parts of my body…</i>

846
00:50:31,290 --> 00:50:32,460
<i>I don't need.</i>

847
00:50:33,840 --> 00:50:37,305
<i>Do you wanna know why older men
grow hair on weird parts of their body?</i>

848
00:50:37,430 --> 00:50:40,470
<i>That's nature's way of saying,
"You're done."</i>

849
00:50:43,010 --> 00:50:46,180
<i>"Stop mating or I'm going to turn you
into a throw rug."</i>

850
00:50:48,270 --> 00:50:51,565
<i>I have some body hair, not as
bad as some men, which is a relief,</i>

851
00:50:51,690 --> 00:50:55,485
<i>'cause as you can see,
I did not win the genetic lottery.</i>

852
00:50:55,610 --> 00:50:57,275
<i>I am bald, blind and pale.</i>

853
00:50:57,400 --> 00:51:00,490
<i>It wouldn't surprise me
if I woke up tomorrow with a tail.</i>

854
00:51:02,080 --> 00:51:03,785
<i>"Have you seen the comic with the tail?"</i>

855
00:51:03,910 --> 00:51:06,750
<i>"He's very pale
and the tail even has a bald spot."</i>

856
00:51:09,370 --> 00:51:12,965
<i>I saw a guy this summer at the pool,
he's probably 60, had his shirt off.</i>

857
00:51:13,090 --> 00:51:16,010
<i>Not a lot of body hair. All body hair.</i>

858
00:51:16,630 --> 00:51:19,720
<i>For a second, I thought they were
shooting a GEICO commercial.</i>

859
00:51:21,300 --> 00:51:22,095
<i>This guy was...</i>

860
00:51:22,220 --> 00:51:25,850
<i>He was so hairy I had to stop
my youngest son from trying to pet him.</i>

861
00:51:27,390 --> 00:51:29,390
<i>"Let him smell your hand first, son."</i>

862
00:51:31,190 --> 00:51:34,235
<i>This guy was hairy and he was walking
around the pool with the confidence</i>

863
00:51:34,360 --> 00:51:37,440
<i>like he'd spent a lifetime dealing
with hairy situations.</i>

864
00:51:38,740 --> 00:51:40,865
<i>No one said anything,
but everyone had the same thought:</i>

865
00:51:40,990 --> 00:51:43,030
<i>"Please don't go in the pool."</i>

866
00:51:44,830 --> 00:51:47,580
<i>"No one's prepared
to see you shake dry."</i>

867
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:54,915
<i>And this man walked right by everyone,</i>

868
00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:57,425
<i>and he sat down next
to an attractive woman.</i>

869
00:51:57,550 --> 00:51:58,545
<i>And I was so impressed.</i>

870
00:51:58,670 --> 00:52:04,800
<i>That woman could look beyond this man's
appearance and focus solely on his wallet.</i>

871
00:52:06,470 --> 00:52:08,350
<i>Whoo!</i>

872
00:52:09,350 --> 00:52:11,395
<i>But we all wanna be good-looking, right?</i>

873
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:13,685
<i>We all wanna be chased
on the playground, right?</i>

874
00:52:13,810 --> 00:52:16,895
<i>Some people go so far
as to get plastic surgery.</i>

875
00:52:17,020 --> 00:52:19,195
<i>They're like,
"Oh, I don't wanna sound desperate,</i>

876
00:52:19,320 --> 00:52:21,240
<i>but can you take a knife to my face?"</i>

877
00:52:22,450 --> 00:52:25,030
<i>"And make me pretty.
Just keep cutting!"</i>

878
00:52:28,410 --> 00:52:31,625
<i>It's kind of amazing more of us
don't get plastic surgery</i>

879
00:52:31,750 --> 00:52:34,415
<i>because we live in
a beauty-obsessed society, right?</i>

880
00:52:34,540 --> 00:52:36,505
<i>There are studies.
There was a Harvard study,</i>

881
00:52:36,630 --> 00:52:40,595
<i>that found that children believed
good-looking people are nicer.</i>

882
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:43,470
<i>That study also found
that children are stupid.</i>

883
00:52:46,470 --> 00:52:49,265
<i>We definitely give good-looking people
the benefit of the doubt.</i>

884
00:52:49,390 --> 00:52:51,685
<i>Like if a really attractive
person's quiet,</i>

885
00:52:51,810 --> 00:52:53,395
<i>we think they're mysterious.</i>

886
00:52:53,520 --> 00:52:57,360
<i>If a fat person is quiet, we assume
they're thinking about food.</i>

887
00:52:59,030 --> 00:53:01,315
<i>And we are, we are,
but there's still a mystery.</i>

888
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:03,280
<i>You don't know what kind of food.</i>

889
00:53:04,530 --> 00:53:06,785
<i>All right, it's cake. It's always cake.</i>

890
00:53:06,910 --> 00:53:09,710
<i>But you don't know what kind.
All right, it's red velvet.</i>

891
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:14,415
<i>As a result, we just like being
around beautiful people.</i>

892
00:53:14,540 --> 00:53:15,705
<i>You ever been out to eat</i>

893
00:53:15,830 --> 00:53:18,165
<i>and you have a waiter or waitress
that's really attractive?</i>

894
00:53:18,290 --> 00:53:21,390
<i>For a second, you're like,
"Wow, this is gonna be a good meal."</i>

895
00:53:23,420 --> 00:53:26,420
<i>You ever have an ugly waiter,
you're like, "Should we leave?"</i>

896
00:53:27,680 --> 00:53:29,265
<i>I think that's why buffets started.</i>

897
00:53:29,390 --> 00:53:31,790
<i>"You know what, I'll get my own food.
Thank you."</i>

898
00:53:32,560 --> 00:53:35,650
<i>"I don't need that mug near my entrée.
You know what I mean?"</i>

899
00:53:37,980 --> 00:53:39,480
<i>"Jim, you're a monster."</i>

900
00:53:41,570 --> 00:53:44,985
<i>We follow good-looking people
on social media, Instagram.</i>

901
00:53:45,110 --> 00:53:47,245
<i>Beautiful people have
millions of followers</i>

902
00:53:47,370 --> 00:53:50,995
<i>and we like their photos
and sometimes, we put a flame emoji.</i>

903
00:53:51,120 --> 00:53:53,705
<i>It's totally socially acceptable.</i>

904
00:53:53,830 --> 00:53:56,165
<i>If you did that in real life,
you'd go to jail.</i>

905
00:53:56,290 --> 00:53:58,705
<i>"Excuse me, sir, what are you doing?"</i>

906
00:53:58,830 --> 00:54:00,630
<i>"I'm following that lady."</i>

907
00:54:02,130 --> 00:54:04,840
<i>"Uh, Can I ask why?"
"I like to look at her."</i>

908
00:54:06,340 --> 00:54:08,510
<i>"Can you give her this torch
I brought her?"</i>

909
00:54:11,100 --> 00:54:12,970
<i>"And these prayer hands."</i>

910
00:54:15,520 --> 00:54:18,520
<i>Everyone's got to settle down
with the prayer hands emoji.</i>

911
00:54:19,480 --> 00:54:21,895
<i>The overuse is ridiculous.</i>

912
00:54:22,020 --> 00:54:24,970
<i>Got a text from a friend,
"See you at dinner. Prayer hands."</i>

913
00:54:26,530 --> 00:54:29,780
<i>"No. No prayer hands.
Are you not gonna make it?"</i>

914
00:54:32,200 --> 00:54:35,500
<i>"What are you suggesting?
That we eat hands for dinner?"</i>

915
00:54:37,830 --> 00:54:39,295
<i>My wife is very good-looking.</i>

916
00:54:39,420 --> 00:54:41,540
<i>That's right, I'm part
of a mixed couple.</i>

917
00:54:43,250 --> 00:54:44,635
<i>It's not fair. She's good-looking,</i>

918
00:54:44,760 --> 00:54:47,045
<i>she's smart, she's creative.
But you know what?</i>

919
00:54:47,170 --> 00:54:48,800
<i>Horrible taste in men.</i>

920
00:54:50,930 --> 00:54:53,185
<i>So it evens out. I'm happily married,</i>

921
00:54:53,310 --> 00:54:56,515
<i>but I would say, once a week,
I catch my wife giving me a look, like,</i>

922
00:54:56,640 --> 00:54:58,390
<i>"I'm gonna have to let you go."</i>

923
00:55:00,270 --> 00:55:03,195
<i>'Cause I disappoint her constantly.</i>

924
00:55:03,320 --> 00:55:04,485
<i>I do things that annoy.</i>

925
00:55:04,610 --> 00:55:06,945
<i>Like, here's something I do
that annoys my wife.</i>

926
00:55:07,070 --> 00:55:08,780
<i>I use the bathroom.</i>

927
00:55:10,820 --> 00:55:13,080
<i>I know. I shouldn't, right?</i>

928
00:55:13,990 --> 00:55:17,790
<i>I get in trouble for not telling her
I'm gonna use the bathroom.</i>

929
00:55:18,580 --> 00:55:21,250
<i>"You just disappeared. Where'd you go?"</i>

930
00:55:23,590 --> 00:55:25,710
<i>"I didn't know I needed a hall pass."</i>

931
00:55:28,050 --> 00:55:31,675
<i>I also get in trouble for telling her
I'm gonna use the bathroom.</i>

932
00:55:31,800 --> 00:55:33,515
<i>"Uh, I'm gonna use the bathroom."</i>

933
00:55:33,640 --> 00:55:34,810
<i>"Again?"</i>

934
00:55:36,430 --> 00:55:38,600
<i>"Are you okay?"</i>

935
00:55:39,560 --> 00:55:42,020
<i>"How many times is that today?"</i>

936
00:55:42,650 --> 00:55:44,820
<i>"You're disgusting."</i>

937
00:55:45,610 --> 00:55:47,565
<i>"What do you do in there?"</i>

938
00:55:47,690 --> 00:55:49,040
<i>"Mostly get away from you."</i>

939
00:55:52,280 --> 00:55:55,245
<i>When my wife's annoyed with me, she
doesn't give me the silent treatment.</i>

940
00:55:55,370 --> 00:55:58,910
<i>She'll just take too long
to answer a simple question.</i>

941
00:55:59,750 --> 00:56:02,415
<i>She'll be standing a foot away,
looking at her phone and I'll be like,</i>

942
00:56:02,540 --> 00:56:06,090
<i>"What time do we have to do that
school thing?" And she'll just be like…</i>

943
00:56:26,770 --> 00:56:28,360
<i>"It's in the calendar."</i>

944
00:56:36,660 --> 00:56:39,870
<i>I'll be like, "Uh, are you mad at me?"</i>

945
00:56:56,970 --> 00:56:58,010
<i>"No."</i>

946
00:57:04,650 --> 00:57:08,315
<i>Recently, we learned that this couple that
we're friends with are getting a divorce.</i>

947
00:57:08,440 --> 00:57:11,235
<i>And not surprisingly,
my wife was very upset.</i>

948
00:57:11,360 --> 00:57:12,450
<i>With me.</i>

949
00:57:14,450 --> 00:57:17,705
<i>I wasn't surprised
'cause this wasn't the first time</i>

950
00:57:17,830 --> 00:57:21,040
<i>something I had nothing to do with
was my fault.</i>

951
00:57:22,500 --> 00:57:25,540
<i>Trump's election, the Kavanaugh
hearings, that was my fault.</i>

952
00:57:26,420 --> 00:57:29,800
<i>And I apologize 'cause
I unconsciously planned the whole thing.</i>

953
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:34,550
<i>Now, I would never describe my wife
as crazy, 'cause I like to be married.</i>

954
00:57:35,840 --> 00:57:37,675
<i>But I do think it's interesting</i>

955
00:57:37,800 --> 00:57:41,595
<i>that if a man calls another man crazy,
it's a compliment.</i>

956
00:57:41,720 --> 00:57:44,185
<i>"Here's my buddy, Joey. He's crazy."</i>

957
00:57:44,310 --> 00:57:46,900
<i>Joey's like, "Oh,
you're just being nice."</i>

958
00:57:48,360 --> 00:57:51,260
<i>But if I was like,
"This is my wife, Jeannie. She's crazy."</i>

959
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:56,410
<i>I even get nervous saying that.</i>

960
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,830
<i>She's back in New York,
but you never know.</i>

961
00:58:08,040 --> 00:58:09,545
<i>'Cause if my wife was standing here</i>

962
00:58:09,670 --> 00:58:11,970
<i>and I was like,
"This is my wife, she's crazy,"</i>

963
00:58:12,840 --> 00:58:13,820
<i>I'd be dead.</i>

964
00:58:15,170 --> 00:58:16,425
<i>And all of you would applaud.</i>

965
00:58:16,550 --> 00:58:19,350
<i>You'd be like, "Well, that was
a teachable moment. Yeah."</i>

966
00:58:23,430 --> 00:58:24,935
<i>"We learned something."</i>

967
00:58:25,060 --> 00:58:26,685
<i>No, we're hanging in there.</i>

968
00:58:26,810 --> 00:58:29,145
<i>By the way,
if at the start of the pandemic,</i>

969
00:58:29,270 --> 00:58:30,485
<i>you were in a relationship</i>

970
00:58:30,610 --> 00:58:34,690
<i>and you're still in that relationship,
you should get money, right?</i>

971
00:58:36,320 --> 00:58:37,400
<i>Right?</i>

972
00:58:39,370 --> 00:58:41,245
<i>Because before the pandemic,</i>

973
00:58:41,370 --> 00:58:44,495
<i>if you'd hear of a couple splitting up,
you were like, "Oh, no."</i>

974
00:58:44,620 --> 00:58:46,745
<i>But during the pandemic,
when you'd hear of a break up,</i>

975
00:58:46,870 --> 00:58:48,750
<i>you're like, "Oh, of course."</i>

976
00:58:51,340 --> 00:58:53,920
<i>You felt for the couples
that stayed together.</i>

977
00:58:54,710 --> 00:58:57,260
<i>"You're still together?
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that."</i>

978
00:58:58,680 --> 00:59:00,090
<i>"Co-dependency, huh?"</i>

979
00:59:02,010 --> 00:59:04,895
<i>'Cause it doesn't matter
how strong your relationship was.</i>

980
00:59:05,020 --> 00:59:07,305
<i>At one point during the pandemic,</i>

981
00:59:07,430 --> 00:59:11,480
<i>you looked at your partner and thought,
"I think I'd rather have the coronavirus."</i>

982
00:59:14,280 --> 00:59:17,360
<i>I know that sounds horrible,
but it's true.</i>

983
00:59:18,740 --> 00:59:20,365
<i>Everyone had that moment
where they're like,</i>

984
00:59:20,490 --> 00:59:22,890
<i>"You know, how uncomfortable
is that ventilator?"</i>

985
00:59:24,410 --> 00:59:25,745
<i>"I know I wouldn't be able to talk,</i>

986
00:59:25,870 --> 00:59:28,370
<i>but does that mean
I wouldn't be able to hear her?"</i>

987
00:59:29,960 --> 00:59:32,500
<i>"Do they have a ventilator
just for the ears?"</i>

988
00:59:33,750 --> 00:59:35,670
<i>"Jim, you're a monster."</i>

989
00:59:37,590 --> 00:59:38,845
<i>My wife's an amazing mother.</i>

990
00:59:38,970 --> 00:59:41,345
<i>We have five children.
Can you believe that?</i>

991
00:59:41,470 --> 00:59:43,050
<i>Five children. Thank you.</i>

992
00:59:44,180 --> 00:59:45,185
<i>Thank you.</i>

993
00:59:45,310 --> 00:59:47,350
<i>It is something I regret…</i>

994
00:59:49,390 --> 00:59:51,040
<i>…'cause there's too many of them.</i>

995
00:59:51,560 --> 00:59:52,645
<i>There's way too many.</i>

996
00:59:52,770 --> 00:59:55,870
<i>Sometimes at dinner, I just pretend
I'm hosting a reality show…</i>

997
00:59:56,860 --> 01:00:01,160
<i>…called </i>So You Think</i>
You're Going To College.</i>

998
01:00:01,320 --> 01:00:03,200
<i>'Cause they all can't go.</i>

999
01:00:04,240 --> 01:00:06,790
<i>They all can't go,
not if I'm getting that boat.</i>

1000
01:00:09,250 --> 01:00:12,245
<i>I'm kidding.
Obviously, I'm not getting the boat…</i>

1001
01:00:12,370 --> 01:00:14,420
<i>not until I get a motorcycle, you know.</i>

1002
01:00:15,670 --> 01:00:17,545
<i>My kids find me annoying.</i>

1003
01:00:17,670 --> 01:00:19,925
<i>All children find their
parents annoying,</i>

1004
01:00:20,050 --> 01:00:25,975
<i>which is kind of ironic, given children
essentially ruined their parents' lives.</i>

1005
01:00:26,100 --> 01:00:28,395
<i>Right?</i>

1006
01:00:28,520 --> 01:00:30,605
<i>Parents give their children their time,</i>

1007
01:00:30,730 --> 01:00:32,435
<i>their energy and their money,</i>

1008
01:00:32,560 --> 01:00:36,270
<i>and we repay our
parents with resentment.</i>

1009
01:00:37,610 --> 01:00:40,275
<i>Have you ever seen an adult get
a phone call from one of their parents?</i>

1010
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:42,400
<i>You'd think it was a debt collector.</i>

1011
01:00:43,240 --> 01:00:44,990
<i>"Ugh. It's my mom."</i>

1012
01:00:46,620 --> 01:00:50,625
<i>"Yeah, I know you took care of me
for a quarter of a century,</i>

1013
01:00:50,750 --> 01:00:52,920
<i>but now is not a good time."</i>

1014
01:01:00,760 --> 01:01:04,260
<i>"You know what wasn't a good time?
Giving up my dreams…</i>

1015
01:01:06,100 --> 01:01:08,310
<i>…so you could be
a general disappointment."</i>

1016
01:01:09,770 --> 01:01:15,520
<i>No, I would never suggest that children
are God's punishment for having sex.</i>

1017
01:01:17,060 --> 01:01:18,770
<i>But an argument could be made.</i>

1018
01:01:21,320 --> 01:01:24,570
<i>And he's up there, "Oh, they're
enjoying that way too much."</i>

1019
01:01:25,240 --> 01:01:28,030
<i>"How can I get them to pray tomorrow?"</i>

1020
01:01:30,080 --> 01:01:33,165
<i>I do love being a parent. It's the most
important thing I'll do in my life.</i>

1021
01:01:33,290 --> 01:01:36,375
<i>But it's an insane proposition.</i>

1022
01:01:36,500 --> 01:01:38,215
<i>You give your children everything.</i>

1023
01:01:38,340 --> 01:01:41,255
<i>You give them everything
and then just one day, they leave.</i>

1024
01:01:41,380 --> 01:01:43,760
<i>They're like,
"See you! Thanks for nothing."</i>

1025
01:01:47,640 --> 01:01:50,140
<i>"I'll let you know if I need help
with a mortgage."</i>

1026
01:01:54,770 --> 01:01:56,275
<i>Sometimes they don't leave, right?</i>

1027
01:01:56,400 --> 01:01:59,060
<i>They just stick around.
They turn into roommates.</i>

1028
01:02:00,110 --> 01:02:01,315
<i>Not going to happen in my house.</i>

1029
01:02:01,440 --> 01:02:03,650
<i>I already have a backpack
for each of them.</i>

1030
01:02:04,190 --> 01:02:05,655
<i>They've seen the bags, "What's that?"</i>

1031
01:02:05,780 --> 01:02:08,780
<i>I'm like, "When you turn 18,
that's your going-away present."</i>

1032
01:02:10,240 --> 01:02:11,790
<i>"Jim, you're a monster."</i>

1033
01:02:12,410 --> 01:02:14,625
<i>I try to be a good dad.</i>

1034
01:02:14,750 --> 01:02:17,085
<i>I feel like I make more of an effort
than my father.</i>

1035
01:02:17,210 --> 01:02:20,210
<i>My dad's generation,
they didn't have to do anything.</i>

1036
01:02:21,040 --> 01:02:24,010
<i>My dad never went
to a parent-teacher conference.</i>

1037
01:02:24,630 --> 01:02:27,130
<i>My dad didn't even
know I went to school.</i>

1038
01:02:29,390 --> 01:02:32,515
<i>My father couldn't be bothered
to turn his head</i>

1039
01:02:32,640 --> 01:02:34,730
<i>if something was happening behind him.</i>

1040
01:02:35,600 --> 01:02:37,500
<i>"What the hell's going on back there?"</i>

1041
01:02:40,400 --> 01:02:43,315
<i>I don't know if he
couldn't turn his head</i>

1042
01:02:43,440 --> 01:02:45,360
<i>or if it wasn't worth the effort.</i>

1043
01:02:46,150 --> 01:02:47,945
<i>"What the hell is going on back there?"</i>

1044
01:02:48,070 --> 01:02:51,240
<i>"Oh, we're celebrating my birthday."</i>

1045
01:02:53,200 --> 01:02:56,400
<i>"Oh, keep it down. I'm watching</i>
Ironsides.</i><i>"</i>

1046
01:02:56,910 --> 01:03:00,165
<i>♪ Happy birthday ♪</i>

1047
01:03:00,290 --> 01:03:02,800
<i>♪ To you ♪</i>

1048
01:03:04,880 --> 01:03:09,300
<i>My children give me guilt trips
I wouldn't even contemplate.</i>

1049
01:03:09,970 --> 01:03:12,515
<i>Like my daughter was in a play
on Thursday and Friday,</i>

1050
01:03:12,640 --> 01:03:14,595
<i>so I went on Thursday night
and then Friday morning,</i>

1051
01:03:14,720 --> 01:03:16,355
<i>she saw me with my rolly bag
and was like,</i>

1052
01:03:16,480 --> 01:03:19,145
<i>"Oh, you're not coming
to my show tonight?"</i>

1053
01:03:19,270 --> 01:03:22,150
<i>I'm like, "You've never been
to one of my shows."</i>

1054
01:03:24,440 --> 01:03:26,530
<i>"I do 300 a year."</i>

1055
01:03:29,070 --> 01:03:30,535
<i>My big plan</i>

1056
01:03:30,660 --> 01:03:36,245
<i>was to teach my children responsibility
by selling posters after one of my shows.</i>

1057
01:03:36,370 --> 01:03:37,955
<i>So I texted my teenage
daughter. I'm like,</i>

1058
01:03:38,080 --> 01:03:40,495
<i>"Do you wanna sell posters
after my show? I'll pay you."</i>

1059
01:03:40,620 --> 01:03:42,255
<i>She texted back, "Great, sounds good."</i>

1060
01:03:42,380 --> 01:03:43,545
<i>Then I texted my teenage son.</i>

1061
01:03:43,670 --> 01:03:45,835
<i>"Do you want to sell posters
after my show? I'll pay you."</i>

1062
01:03:45,960 --> 01:03:48,590
<i>He texted back, "No thanks.
I don't need the money."</i>

1063
01:03:52,090 --> 01:03:54,050
<i>He doesn't have any money.</i>

1064
01:03:55,560 --> 01:03:57,410
<i>He has my money.</i>

1065
01:03:58,810 --> 01:04:01,020
<i>I just texted back,
"You're out of the will."</i>

1066
01:04:02,690 --> 01:04:04,570
<i>I'm kidding. He was never in it.</i>

1067
01:04:07,400 --> 01:04:09,315
<i>If my father asked me to do something,</i>

1068
01:04:09,440 --> 01:04:12,070
<i>he wouldn't even stick around
for an answer.</i>

1069
01:04:12,870 --> 01:04:15,520
<i>"You wanna shovel the driveway?"
Then he'd just leave.</i>

1070
01:04:17,330 --> 01:04:21,370
<i>It was understood I was gonna shovel
the driveway or move out.</i>

1071
01:04:24,590 --> 01:04:26,255
<i>I was kind of frightened of my dad.</i>

1072
01:04:26,380 --> 01:04:31,550
<i>My children treat me like some bank
teller they reluctantly have to deal with.</i>

1073
01:04:33,720 --> 01:04:35,885
<i>Once a week,
they just appear in front of me.</i>

1074
01:04:36,010 --> 01:04:39,600
<i>"Hmm… Mom said I could get a shark…</i>

1075
01:04:42,980 --> 01:04:45,190
<i>…so I guess I need your credit card."</i>

1076
01:04:47,570 --> 01:04:51,280
<i>I'm like, "What are you talking about?"
"He's yelling again, Mom!"</i>

1077
01:04:56,530 --> 01:05:01,660
<i>If my dad was in a room in the house,
I wouldn't go to that side of the house.</i>

1078
01:05:03,080 --> 01:05:04,790
<i>"I'll just pee outside."</i>

1079
01:05:06,080 --> 01:05:09,795
<i>And I had all these older siblings that
used to send me in there to ask questions.</i>

1080
01:05:09,920 --> 01:05:11,675
<i>"Go ask Dad if we can
go to Dairy Queen."</i>

1081
01:05:11,800 --> 01:05:13,215
<i>"I'm not doing it. I'm not doing it."</i>

1082
01:05:13,340 --> 01:05:14,890
<i>"Go. You're too young to kill."</i>

1083
01:05:17,220 --> 01:05:18,515
<i>"Dad?"
"What the hell do you want?"</i>

1084
01:05:18,640 --> 01:05:20,220
<i>"He said, no."</i>

1085
01:05:26,520 --> 01:05:29,105
<i>When I didn't have kids,
I didn't understand my dad at all.</i>

1086
01:05:29,230 --> 01:05:32,730
<i>By the way, if you don't have children,
none of this should make sense.</i>

1087
01:05:33,990 --> 01:05:36,405
<i>Or even the concept of a Saturday night.</i>

1088
01:05:36,530 --> 01:05:39,785
<i>When you don't have kids,
you're like, "Saturday!"</i>

1089
01:05:39,910 --> 01:05:43,710
<i>And when you're a parent, you're like,
"Who can we pay to come to this house…</i>

1090
01:05:46,420 --> 01:05:48,670
<i>…and watch this child?"</i>

1091
01:05:49,670 --> 01:05:53,715
<i>And your standards drop so dramatically.</i>

1092
01:05:53,840 --> 01:05:55,715
<i>Initially, like, "They
should have a PhD."</i>

1093
01:05:55,840 --> 01:05:58,640
<i>And then you're like,
"Well, how long were they in jail?"</i>

1094
01:06:00,060 --> 01:06:02,350
<i>"Murder? It wasn't children, right?"</i>

1095
01:06:04,060 --> 01:06:05,980
<i>"A Satanist? You'll fit right in."</i>

1096
01:06:10,940 --> 01:06:14,945
<i>Any parent will tell you that, like,
having children has enriched their lives.</i>

1097
01:06:15,070 --> 01:06:17,535
<i>It's exposed them to things
they never thought they'd do.</i>

1098
01:06:17,660 --> 01:06:20,495
<i>Like kids just... You end up doing
things you never thought you'd do.</i>

1099
01:06:20,620 --> 01:06:22,740
<i>Like for me, going outside.</i>

1100
01:06:24,370 --> 01:06:27,955
<i>You ever go outside with real little kids?
You don't even know what to do with them.</i>

1101
01:06:28,080 --> 01:06:30,960
<i>You're like,
"Well, I normally just drink out here."</i>

1102
01:06:34,840 --> 01:06:36,930
<i>"Who wants to play a game of nap?"</i>

1103
01:06:40,510 --> 01:06:44,180
<i>It's weird when your kids have
a friend that you're not a fan of.</i>

1104
01:06:45,180 --> 01:06:48,310
<i>"Oh, Tommy's coming over?
Well, I'll be leaving."</i>

1105
01:06:50,650 --> 01:06:53,150
<i>"You can text me when Tommy is gone…</i>

1106
01:06:54,440 --> 01:06:55,860
<i>…'cause he's immature."</i>

1107
01:06:58,110 --> 01:07:00,945
<i>I wasn't prepared
for all the activities kids have.</i>

1108
01:07:01,070 --> 01:07:04,745
<i>You pick up your kid and bring them to
an activity, then to another activity.</i>

1109
01:07:04,870 --> 01:07:06,455
<i>And if they don't have an activity,</i>

1110
01:07:06,580 --> 01:07:09,000
<i>you have to think of one,
or they'll smoke meth.</i>

1111
01:07:11,840 --> 01:07:14,465
<i>You're always looking
for an activity as a parent.</i>

1112
01:07:14,590 --> 01:07:17,715
<i>I took my kids to Ripley's Believe It or
Not.</i>

1113
01:07:17,840 --> 01:07:21,190
<i>I don't know if you've ever been
that desperate for something to do.</i>

1114
01:07:22,140 --> 01:07:24,135
<i>What can I tell you about Ripley's Believe It or
Not?</i>

1115
01:07:24,260 --> 01:07:26,220
<i>It's mostly not.</i>

1116
01:07:28,440 --> 01:07:32,150
<i>It's not interesting.
It's not even a lot of stuff.</i>

1117
01:07:32,730 --> 01:07:36,110
<i>It's like they just emptied out
some drifter's storage unit.</i>

1118
01:07:37,990 --> 01:07:41,075
<i>I do admire that
business model, you know.</i>

1119
01:07:41,200 --> 01:07:44,285
<i>Most businesses attempt
to establish trust with the customer.</i>

1120
01:07:44,410 --> 01:07:45,745
<i>Not Ripley's.</i>

1121
01:07:45,870 --> 01:07:48,750
<i>Like, "Believe it… or not.
We don't care."</i>

1122
01:07:50,500 --> 01:07:52,250
<i>"We know you're not coming back."</i>

1123
01:07:56,250 --> 01:07:58,595
<i>I'm still getting used
to having teenagers.</i>

1124
01:07:58,720 --> 01:08:02,305
<i>Recently, my 17-year-old daughter
told me that she wants to be an actor,</i>

1125
01:08:02,430 --> 01:08:04,935
<i>which is so crazy
'cause when I was that age,</i>

1126
01:08:05,060 --> 01:08:07,805
<i>that movie Dead Poets Society  came out,</i>

1127
01:08:07,930 --> 01:08:10,355
<i>which is an amazing movie
with Robin Williams,</i>

1128
01:08:10,480 --> 01:08:15,195
<i>where he plays this teacher who inspires
these students to seize the day, right?</i>

1129
01:08:15,320 --> 01:08:18,405
<i>And one of the students wants
to be an actor.</i>

1130
01:08:18,530 --> 01:08:21,985
<i>And, you know, he joins the play
and he invites his dad to see the play</i>

1131
01:08:22,110 --> 01:08:24,615
<i>and after the play, he tells his dad
that he wants to be an actor.</i>

1132
01:08:24,740 --> 01:08:28,840
<i>Dad's like, "You're not gonna be an actor,
that's stupid. Waste of time and money…"</i>

1133
01:08:29,040 --> 01:08:31,455
<i>The kid's so distraught
he kills himself,</i>

1134
01:08:31,580 --> 01:08:34,920
<i>and then the teacher gets fired
and all the kids stand on desks…</i>

1135
01:08:39,510 --> 01:08:41,340
<i>Anyway, it's a great movie.</i>

1136
01:08:42,720 --> 01:08:47,305
<i>No, now… now that I'm the parent
of a teenager,</i>

1137
01:08:47,430 --> 01:08:52,640
<i>I realized that dad in </i>Dead Poets Society</i><i> was
right.</i>

1138
01:08:54,900 --> 01:08:58,530
<i>I'm kidding. I know the point
of the movie is, "Don't be a teacher."</i>

1139
01:09:03,570 --> 01:09:05,990
<i>My wife hates that joke so much.</i>

1140
01:09:07,580 --> 01:09:09,035
<i>My kids, I don't know what they think.</i>

1141
01:09:09,160 --> 01:09:11,860
<i>I don't even think my kids know
what I do for a living.</i>

1142
01:09:12,660 --> 01:09:16,465
<i>Or I should say I didn't think
they knew what I did for a living</i>

1143
01:09:16,590 --> 01:09:18,425
<i>till last Halloween.</i>

1144
01:09:18,550 --> 01:09:21,425
<i>My 10-year-old, Michael, didn't know
what he wanted to be for Halloween,</i>

1145
01:09:21,550 --> 01:09:23,095
<i>which is a crisis.</i>

1146
01:09:23,220 --> 01:09:25,305
<i>If you're a parent, you know this.</i>

1147
01:09:25,430 --> 01:09:28,015
<i>Then, like, two days before Halloween,
he ran up to me and he goes,</i>

1148
01:09:28,140 --> 01:09:29,895
<i>"I know what I'm gonna be for
Halloween."</i>

1149
01:09:30,020 --> 01:09:32,680
<i>"I'm gonna be a stand-up comedian."</i>

1150
01:09:33,270 --> 01:09:34,315
<i>And I was so touched.</i>

1151
01:09:34,440 --> 01:09:37,645
<i>I was like, "Oh, my gosh, for Halloween,
you wanna be your dad."</i>

1152
01:09:37,770 --> 01:09:40,690
<i>And he goes,
"No, I wanna be John Mulaney."</i>

1153
01:09:42,320 --> 01:09:45,865
<i>Slap! Right across the face.</i>

1154
01:09:45,990 --> 01:09:47,700
<i>Thank you so much, you guys.</i>

1155
01:09:49,030 --> 01:09:50,080
<i>Appreciate it.</i>

1156
01:10:43,670 --> 01:10:45,670
<i>That's Mom and Dad.</i>
