other questions in mind.

Does the Senator Organa

One day, he was only
a pastor of nerfs of Tatooine.

It is without doubt the best film
made by fans ever filmed.

00:18:52,882 --> 00:18:54,713
There are some that are
better technically.

There are other

Seeing her, I realized: "It's different."

365
00:20:24,841 --> 00:20:27,332
And then I saw ...

366
00:20:27,610 --> 00:20:30,044
It is his vision, and I respect it ...

367
00:20:30,113 --> 00:20:33,879

00:20:46,662 --> 00:20:48,857

The changes are dramatic.

392
00:21:38,915 --> 00:21:43,852
I try to think of something
where the changes are dramatic ...

393
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:46,548

Yes, the Bible!

00:21:57,967 --> 00:21:59,764
I added the scene of Jabba the Hutt
with Han Solo ...

398
00:21:59,835 --> 00:22:02,000
It was a scene ...
that had been cut ...

399
00:22:02,063 --> 00:22:03,995
Due to limitations ...
of time and money ...

400
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:05,800
And when I finished ...
the third movie ...

401
00:22:05,841 --> 00:22:08,207
I really wanted to ... put it there.

402
00:22:08,344 --> 00:22:10,505
- It was stupid.
- It was a little ...

403
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:13,549
It was great to appear
because I have an affinity with this beast ...

412

415
00:22:45,214 --> 00:22:48,274
From a dramatic standpoint,
the scene is totally unnecessary.

416
00:22:48,351 --> 00:22:50,581
We had technical difficulties <i>

And other damage ...
in the negative and others.

420
00:22:59,061 --> 00:23:00,323
So we leave.

421
00:23:00,396 --> 00:23:03,593
But in that process, we put

The upcoming changes, I think ...

That were made ... ...

427
00:23:19,415 --> 00:23:23,374
... Because George is not the same director
I was in the mid-seventies.

Yes, sure.

434
00:23:39,235 --> 00:23:41,897
Then did the special editions,
Greedo shoots first ...

"Greedo never shot first!"

439
00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:58,946

Are you serious?

506
00:27:13,616 --> 00:27:17,382

"<i> Wars </ i>" ...

To decide ...
this was too violent.

516
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:56,714
But you can not condemn a man
already condemned to servitude ...

He would say: "No, I dropped the cigarette.

"As the films do not represent

Not even possible.

"We want you to know

... Now or in the future,

to restore earlier versions. "

657

In essence, says that
the original negative no longer exists ...

658
00:34:26,949 --> 00:34:28,883
... Because of its restoration.

659
00:34:28,951 --> 00:34:30,816
But how could it be?

660
00:34:30,886 --> 00:34:35,619
Because there must be transformed
the films on digital ...

661
00:34:35,691 --> 00:34:38,990
And then ... must have worked
in their new special effects ...

00:34:40,629 --> 00:34:44,395

be transformed back to tape.

664
00:34:44,466 --> 00:34:47,196
So now the film there
in the new version.

665
00:34:47,269 --> 00:34:51,797
But you still have the original tape
with which it started working.

666
00:34:51,974 --> 00:34:54,306
No, really,
physically cut a negative.

667

A file ...

668
00:34:56,345 --> 00:34:59,781
It doubles the negative, then
changes are made after that.

669
00:34:59,848 --> 00:35:01,315
So I find it hard to believe ...

670
00:35:01,383 --> 00:35:04,716
They have really destroyed ...
the negative of the film.

671
00:35:04,786 --> 00:35:08,244
And if they did, it's atrocious.

672
00:35:08,323 --> 00:35:09,790
"Never again you will see the original."

673
00:35:09,858 --> 00:35:13,692
That says Lucasfilm
but probably not true.

674
00:35:15,564 --> 00:35:20,126
In the mid-eighties,
There was a filmmaker ...

675
00:35:20,202 --> 00:35:23,968
... It was on a crusade
against Ted Turner ...

676
00:35:24,039 --> 00:35:26,371
I wanted color ... movies
black and white.

677
00:35:26,441 --> 00:35:30,207
The same filmmaker argued
that black and white films ...

678
00:35:30,345 --> 00:35:32,210
Were the epitome ...
of our cultural heritage ...

679
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:34,680
... And that not due modify.

680
00:35:34,750 --> 00:35:37,048
That was filmmaker George Lucas.

681
00:35:37,986 --> 00:35:39,817
In 1988, George Lucas testified
before Congress ...

682
00:35:39,888 --> 00:35:41,981
Against the colored ...
of black and white films.

683
00:35:42,057 --> 00:35:44,958
The following year, <i> WAR </ i>
<i> OF GALAXIES </ i> was a ...

684
00:35:45,027 --> 00:35:50,090
... The first 25 films
entered the National Film Registry.

685
00:35:50,565 --> 00:35:54,695
In the future it will be easier
the negatives are lost ...

686
00:35:54,770 --> 00:35:56,533
... And are "replaced"
altered by new films.

687
00:35:56,605 --> 00:35:57,799
This would be a great loss
for our society.

688
00:35:57,873 --> 00:35:59,864
Do not allow our
cultural history is rewritten.

689
00:35:59,941 --> 00:36:01,169
George Lucas

690
00:36:01,243 --> 00:36:02,710
Never heard <i>. </ i>

691
00:36:02,978 --> 00:36:07,005
Then I say, "What rot."

692
00:36:07,082 --> 00:36:09,050
He says: "There can be colored
old movies ...

693
00:36:09,117 --> 00:36:12,086
... But I'm going to completely change
my film and it will ".

694
00:36:12,154 --> 00:36:14,714
- It's obscene.
- Okay, because I wanted ...

695
00:36:14,790 --> 00:36:17,691
You lideraste campaign
against the color of the films.

696
00:36:17,759 --> 00:36:19,283
You know why they should not be changed.

697
00:36:19,361 --> 00:36:20,487
HUNTERS OF THE LOST ARK

698
00:36:20,562 --> 00:36:22,826
Is different. These are my movies.

699
00:36:22,964 --> 00:36:24,397
<i> One could argue ... </ i>

700
00:36:24,466 --> 00:36:25,956
<i> ... that if you entered

00:36:26,034 --> 00:36:27,433

00:36:27,502 --> 00:36:28,662
<i> ... belongs to the whole world. </ i>

703
00:36:28,737 --> 00:36:30,898

<i> ... because it is so important,
culturally, to the United States. </ i>

705
00:36:36,244 --> 00:36:38,144
So when you say,
indiscriminately:

706
00:36:38,213 --> 00:36:40,147
"We will change it and improve it ...

707
00:36:40,215 --> 00:36:43,582
... And evolve with the times "...

708
00:36:43,652 --> 00:36:46,416
Sculpt ... it's like Bill Clinton
on Mount Rushmore.

709
00:36:46,521 --> 00:36:48,716
Has a responsibility
with the history of cinema.

710
00:36:48,790 --> 00:36:50,758
You know ...

711
00:36:50,826 --> 00:36:53,351
Can you get Congress to send:

712
00:36:53,428 --> 00:36:56,295
"You must deliver that
Smithsonian museum now "?

713
00:36:56,364 --> 00:36:59,800
Maybe not,
but would be great to happen.

714
00:37:00,535 --> 00:37:02,596
The Library of Congress rejected
all our requests for interviews.

715
00:37:02,671 --> 00:37:04,366
Like the Film Archive
and Television at UCLA ...

716
00:37:04,439 --> 00:37:06,407
... And the Association of Archivists
Moving Image.

717
00:37:06,475 --> 00:37:09,706
Mr. Lucas, please throw them.

At least,

00:37:12,814 --> 00:37:17,046
Please give us the original film.
Forever.

720

Just give us the original.

00:37:18,253 --> 00:37:22,121
Although not remove

Steven Spielberg launched

Terry Gilliam accepted

00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:52,244

735

"Take, watch one after the other.

Compare the two.
I think this is better. "

742
00:38:06,835 --> 00:38:08,735
It has nothing to do

But transformed ...
a producer and entrepreneur.

761
00:38:58,119 --> 00:39:01,247
In a way,
is the worst thing that happened to George Lucas.

762
00:39:01,323 --> 00:39:05,817
Could have made a happy career

All toys that are
behind me here ...

835
00:42:19,554 --> 00:42:23,718
... I have made the heart ache
Over the past 30 years.

836
00:42:23,792 --> 00:42:27,421
I think I'll throw a box of products
and sell expensive.

837
00:42:27,495 --> 00:42:29,986
I will not tell people
separately that cost less.

838
00:42:30,064 --> 00:42:31,395
It would be fun.

839
00:42:32,100 --> 00:42:33,692
I bought it on VHS.

840

NATHAN BEAUDRY
Alias ??ChefElf

841
00:42:34,869 --> 00:42:36,734
I bought the whole box

three or four times.

842
00:42:36,805 --> 00:42:39,330
This is the last box,
and I bought it like an idiot.

843
00:42:39,407 --> 00:42:41,967
This <i> because it brings things </ i>
<i> </ i> Star Wars <i> and </ i> Jedi ...

844
00:42:42,043 --> 00:42:45,774
<i> ... and the next
because it is mastered ... </ i>

845
00:42:45,847 --> 00:42:47,314
<i> ... thus is improved. </ i>

846
00:42:47,382 --> 00:42:49,179
I went to buy <i>
because it was widescreen. </ i>

847
00:42:49,250 --> 00:42:51,946
<i> again because
was a special assembly. </ i>

848
00:42:52,587 --> 00:42:54,350
Do not know why I bought that, but ...

849
00:42:54,422 --> 00:42:57,983
It's like giving us an orgasm.

850
00:42:58,059 --> 00:42:59,458
We had an orgasm, and now says:

851
00:42:59,527 --> 00:43:01,085
"Come on, no more."

852
00:43:01,162 --> 00:43:03,926
We say: "Enough. Let me sleep."

853
00:43:04,199 --> 00:43:05,564
That that, "I being exploited" ...

855
00:43:06,801 --> 00:43:08,268
Please. Let's be serious.

856
00:43:08,336 --> 00:43:12,636
Someone <i> provides a product,
you choose to buy it. </ i>

857
00:43:12,740 --> 00:43:14,833
<i> If you want to see,

858
00:43:14,909 --> 00:43:17,275
<i> ... has nothing to do
with who did it. </ i>

859
00:43:17,345 --> 00:43:19,905
They did it because they thought
I could have a market.

860
00:43:19,981 --> 00:43:21,107
In this case, they are right.

861
00:43:21,182 --> 00:43:25,346
If the fans want to buy everything
what set George ...

862
00:43:25,420 --> 00:43:27,888
<i> ... as if compelled ... </ i>

863
00:43:27,956 --> 00:43:31,392
<i> ... is like a drug. </ i>

864
00:43:31,459 --> 00:43:33,484
You can say someone became addicted.

865
00:43:33,561 --> 00:43:36,086
Finally, it is you that is injected.

866
00:43:36,164 --> 00:43:39,827
There are many people like this ...

867
00:43:40,935 --> 00:43:45,531
... And perhaps always be addicts
to <i> Wars </ i>.

868
00:43:46,441 --> 00:43:48,773

By God!

878
00:44:12,567 --> 00:44:15,536
Think it's easy to abandon this.

879
00:44:15,637 --> 00:44:18,504
Now that I talk about this,
I feel I was in therapy.

880
00:44:18,606 --> 00:44:20,597
Hello, my name is Chris.

881
00:44:21,242 --> 00:44:22,436
The fans kept him alive ...

882
00:44:22,510 --> 00:44:25,570
... With toys,
the stories and speculation ...

883
00:44:25,647 --> 00:44:30,812
Whether there would ... more adventures
of this series and how they would be.

884
00:44:30,885 --> 00:44:33,615
Caravan of Courage is <i> </ i>,
but that does not count.

885
00:44:33,688 --> 00:44:38,057
Want more, and when there is nothing ...

886
00:44:38,126 --> 00:44:40,253
... You take care of creating something yourself.

13 JANUARY 1995

904
00:45:23,004 --> 00:45:25,029
When they announced <i>
that finally would come ... </ i>

905
00:45:25,106 --> 00:45:28,371

All want to see this movie.

909
00:45:32,580 --> 00:45:35,572
This will be a giant time

<i> - All fans ...
- "What will?" </ I>

- ... Created it in his head.
- Yes

913
00:45:42,423 --> 00:45:45,187
Then I thought:
"By God, we all hate."

914
00:45:45,593 --> 00:45:49,359
It may not hate
because it has ...

915
00:45:49,430 --> 00:45:52,263
much involved emotionally <i>
in the first. </ i>

916
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:55,826
I remember the day
they announced the name ...

<i> ... And The Phantom Menace </ i> came out
and they all said:

As the premiere ...
most anticipated of the decade.

924
00:46:12,320 --> 00:46:14,254
Five words:

No, I will go after the advance.

933
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:35,203
Did you pay to enter

934
00:46:35,276 --> 00:46:36,709
- ... And then you left?
- Yes

935
00:46:36,778 --> 00:46:38,405
Because they are two and a half minutes great.

936
00:46:38,479 --> 00:46:39,673
It was amazing.

937
00:46:39,747 --> 00:46:42,181
There was never anything like it.

938
00:46:42,717 --> 00:46:43,809
By God!

939
00:46:43,885 --> 00:46:46,353
I began to mourn
as not doing in years.

940
00:46:46,421 --> 00:46:47,615
I had a heart attack.

941
00:46:47,689 --> 00:46:52,786
I think God should be ashamed
as a creator to watch this movie ...

942
00:46:52,860 --> 00:46:55,090
And realize ...
that did not create something that good.

943
00:46:55,163 --> 00:46:58,394
This is something I will remember
and tell my children.

944
00:46:58,466 --> 00:47:00,491
It's camera - I know, I look crazy.

945
00:47:00,568 --> 00:47:01,865
It was like a Beatles concert.

That's incredible.

1002
00:49:15,736 --> 00:49:17,328
Who thought this day would come?

1003
00:49:17,405 --> 00:49:19,999
And it was one of the greatest moments ...

1004
00:49:21,475 --> 00:49:23,739
Life ... a spectator.

1005
00:49:23,811 --> 00:49:25,870
Then begins the film.

1006
00:49:25,947 --> 00:49:30,975
I knew that. The language
of the opening sequence was wrong.

1007
00:49:31,052 --> 00:49:32,144
Not appreciated as correct.

1008
00:49:32,220 --> 00:49:34,154
But I said, "Okay. I'll keep looking."

1009
00:49:34,222 --> 00:49:37,385
It started as a glow
in the heart ...

1010
00:49:37,458 --> 00:49:38,925
Down ... and then ...

1011
00:49:38,993 --> 00:49:42,690
... Down here.

1012
00:49:42,797 --> 00:49:47,894
I remember thinking:
"By God, Is it really ...?

1013
00:49:47,969 --> 00:49:49,493
Is that bad? "

1014
00:49:49,570 --> 00:49:52,403
I was very disappointed.

1015
00:49:52,473 --> 00:49:57,706
I said "What? Is it bad?"

1016
00:49:58,379 --> 00:50:00,006
I began to get discouraged ...

1017
00:50:00,081 --> 00:50:02,845
But ... continued:
"It <i> Wars </ i>. Will improve.

1018
00:50:02,917 --> 00:50:06,819
The Jedi is not great, does not matter.
It will be good. "

1019
00:50:06,888 --> 00:50:11,382
Was used to seeing
people who saw the original ...

1020
00:50:11,459 --> 00:50:15,896
Screaming ... excited,
clapping, laughing.

1021
00:50:15,963 --> 00:50:19,865
This was indeed
a silent projection.

1022
00:50:19,934 --> 00:50:22,630
Perhaps it was something different.
You may not notice it.

1023
00:50:22,703 --> 00:50:26,036
Perhaps we should see her again.

1024
00:50:26,107 --> 00:50:27,574
It was the first time in my life ...

1025
00:50:27,642 --> 00:50:32,670
A movie ...
really disappointed me ...

1026
00:50:32,747 --> 00:50:33,805
I was sad ... and ...

1027
00:50:33,881 --> 00:50:37,408
... To the point of having to lie about
what was to maintain the honor.

1028
00:50:37,485 --> 00:50:40,181
I remember interviewing
in local news ...

1029
00:50:40,254 --> 00:50:44,418
... Where they said:
"Yes, but tomorrow we go again."

1030
00:50:45,192 --> 00:50:46,386
There was still hope.

1031
00:50:46,460 --> 00:50:51,022
People are not convinced ...

1032
00:50:51,098 --> 00:50:53,157
... Until I saw her ...

1033
00:50:53,234 --> 00:50:55,395
... Because everyone saw it twice.

1034
00:50:55,469 --> 00:50:56,800
We all saw it again.

1035
00:50:56,871 --> 00:50:59,931
I waited four days <i> in the rain ... </ i>

1170
00:57:14,548 --> 00:57:17,210
The difficulty is
if Jar Jar Binks is racist ...

1171
00:57:17,284 --> 00:57:18,911
Humor ... because it looks black face ...

1172
00:57:18,986 --> 00:57:21,386
... But no one saw this kind of humor ...

1173
00:57:21,455 --> 00:57:23,787
If 12 years ...
and see prequel saga ...

1174
00:57:23,857 --> 00:57:27,691
Racist character ... whose racism
is so encoded in the story ...

1175
00:57:27,761 --> 00:57:29,456
Racist ... still?

1176
00:57:29,663 --> 00:57:31,893
Jar Jar worst of it exists.

If you're a fan ...

... In your heart you know that Jar Jar

... But is an integral part.

1181
00:57:40,140 --> 00:57:42,700
Jar Jar Binks is
fundamental part of the whole saga.

1182
00:57:42,976 --> 00:57:44,773
Meesa proposes ...

1183
00:57:44,845 --> 00:57:49,748
... That the Senate give immediately
emergency powers ...

... The Supreme Chancellor.

1185
00:57:53,654 --> 00:57:56,680

This combination seems to me successful ...

1213
00:59:07,361 --> 00:59:09,261
... Because one does not negate the other.

1214
00:59:09,897 --> 00:59:11,762
Jar-Jar Binks is proof to me ...

Giving a show ...
to the public.

1221
00:59:21,375 --> 00:59:25,835
The problem with Jar Jar Binks
not the character.

1222
00:59:25,913 --> 00:59:30,714
It is with you, the fans,
they have forgotten what it was to be children.

1223
00:59:30,784 --> 00:59:32,684
- Kids like Jar Jar!
- Why?

1224
00:59:32,753 --> 00:59:34,914
What about the Ewoks?

1225
00:59:34,988 --> 00:59:36,979
They were rubbish. Not complain of them.

1226
00:59:37,057 --> 00:59:40,754
Yeah, but Jar Jar Binks makes
that the Ewoks look like Shaft.

1261
01:01:03,777 --> 01:01:05,531
It is condescending way ...

1262
01:01:05,582 --> 01:01:07,543
Because it makes these movies ...
for children.

1263
01:01:07,614 --> 01:01:09,377
- What has been said many times.
- Yes

1264
01:01:09,449 --> 01:01:11,542
George said:
"These films are for kids.

1265
01:01:11,618 --> 01:01:12,983
I make them for children. "

1266
01:01:13,053 --> 01:01:15,817
And when we loved the trilogy
original, we were kids.

1267
01:01:15,889 --> 01:01:17,880
Does George or old age is upon us?

1268
01:01:17,958 --> 01:01:23,362
Should we, as adults,
understand what it does as a filmmaker ...

1269
01:01:23,430 --> 01:01:26,900
... Or should have made films
for people who matured ...

1270
01:01:26,950 --> 01:01:28,026
... And enjoyed the first?

1271
01:01:28,101 --> 01:01:30,262

that is made for children ...

1272
01:01:30,337 --> 01:01:34,103

is nonsense.

1273
01:01:34,575 --> 01:01:38,671
Yes, it is difficult to know
if you really believe that ...

1274
01:01:38,745 --> 01:01:43,876
Or taken by surprise ...

Enough. No Scientologists goals.

You can not worry

For example, <i> Wars </ i>

01:04:25,712 --> 01:04:30,081
I do not think ... that's the best way
to work for an artist.

1335
01:04:30,150 --> 01:04:33,176
It's over a certain level of criticism.

1336
01:04:33,653 --> 01:04:36,781
He spent the idea of ??a
true collaboration.

1337
01:04:36,857 --> 01:04:41,817
This is about a channeling
internal stories ...

1338
01:04:41,895 --> 01:04:44,420
... Who have been on your mind
for a long time.

1339
01:04:44,498 --> 01:04:49,902
I wanted to control my work ...

1340
01:04:49,970 --> 01:04:51,232
... And that people do not change.

1341
01:04:51,304 --> 01:04:53,829
It's fun
because I do not answer to anyone.

1342
01:04:53,907 --> 01:04:56,637
Nobody tells me what to do.
I earned it.

1343
01:04:57,477 --> 01:05:01,436
<i> If you have a film empire
to help you make movies ... </ i>

1344
01:05:01,515 --> 01:05:05,611
What's the point ...
if you do not feed back?

1345
01:05:05,685 --> 01:05:10,554
I think he took something wonderful
and maintain control over that ...

1346
01:05:10,624 --> 01:05:14,788
Capitalized ... while with him,
I think it destroyed.

1347
01:05:14,861 --> 01:05:19,821
Yes, it's like an overprotective parent.
And if so, ruined his son.

1348
01:05:19,900 --> 01:05:22,494
And that bothers
because he had a bright son.

1349
01:05:23,303 --> 01:05:27,239
It's a great day for you.
Wait while I prepare.

1350
01:05:28,175 --> 01:05:31,941
- What will prepare?
- Your new study, silly.

1351
01:05:32,012 --> 01:05:34,879
- For you to continue writing the series.
- How?

1352
01:05:34,948 --> 01:05:38,384
Write <i> Episode III </ i>, George.

1353
01:05:38,451 --> 01:05:41,249
But this time, will do well.

1354
01:05:42,022 --> 01:05:45,219
You'll do as I see it.

1355
01:05:45,292 --> 01:05:48,955
At the time,
it hurt a lot ...

1356
01:05:49,029 --> 01:05:52,829
The studies ... to ride again
THX-1138 and American Graffiti.

1357
01:05:53,400 --> 01:05:56,096
He swore to himself
this will never happen again ...

1358
01:05:56,169 --> 01:05:57,966
... Because from now on ...

1359
01:05:58,038 --> 01:06:00,165
Would have total control ...
about their jobs.

1360
01:06:00,240 --> 01:06:03,232
In 1999, fans began
to reassemble his movies ...

1361
01:06:03,977 --> 01:06:06,878
With the tools ...
Luke offered.

1362
01:06:07,180 --> 01:06:12,049
This is perhaps one of the best.
Episode is called <i> I.II </ i>.

1363
01:06:12,118 --> 01:06:15,383
Is a cover of about 70 minutes.
And it's a much better movie.

1364
01:06:15,455 --> 01:06:19,755
But I love this legend:
"Look how they should be."

1365
01:06:19,826 --> 01:06:22,056
And then a graph of BAND-AID.

1366
01:06:22,128 --> 01:06:26,622
It's hard not to read most of the
Fan mounts a critique ...

1367
01:06:26,700 --> 01:06:29,191
Creative decisions ...
taken by George Lucas.

1368
01:06:29,269 --> 01:06:32,067
So this
is what most hurts him.

1369
01:06:32,539 --> 01:06:35,099

energy and passion in this ...

I felt horrible.

In <i> Wars </ i>

1376

1378
01:06:55,428 --> 01:06:57,896
They are not part of my

1381
01:07:02,435 --> 01:07:04,335
I did reduce ...
the duration of each episode ...

1382
01:07:04,404 --> 01:07:06,998
... To create two films,
one for each trilogy.

1383
01:07:07,073 --> 01:07:09,735
For my "powdered version"
I went back to frame each shot ...

1384
01:07:09,809 --> 01:07:12,903
And adapted the movies ...
a 4:3 aspect ratio ...

1385
01:07:13,046 --> 01:07:15,708
... And changed the frame rate
to 18 frames per second.

1386
01:07:15,782 --> 01:07:17,875
I also added color casts ...

1387

As each planet ...
where the action ...

1388
01:07:20,120 --> 01:07:22,213

- No!

01:09:21,975 --> 01:09:24,967
... Shouting with all their might so ...

1428

that is growling. It's surreal.

1499
01:13:00,326 --> 01:13:02,294
The grandfather of the clan, Itchy ...

1500
01:13:02,695 --> 01:13:05,163
<i> ... it gets kind of old ... </ i>

1501

1503
01:13:18,378 --> 01:13:20,744
We're excited, right?

1504
01:13:20,813 --> 01:13:24,305
How many people saw <i> Christmas Special </ i>
<i> The Star Wars </ i>?

1505
01:13:24,384 --> 01:13:27,148
In some cultures,
is a war crime.

1506
01:13:28,187 --> 01:13:30,655
Very soon realized
that this was damaging ...

1507
01:13:30,723 --> 01:13:34,056
Luke ... the image and brand
<i> Wars </ i> ...

1508

... And tried to remove it
history.

1509
01:13:37,597 --> 01:13:39,189
Without success.

1510
01:13:41,034 --> 01:13:45,630
Here is my copy
perfectly legitimate ...

01:13:45,705 --> 01:13:48,799
<i> ... The Holiday Special </ i>

1512
01:13:49,275 --> 01:13:53,177

poorly coded ...

... To Internet format,
is an effect of the lens.

1514
01:13:56,349 --> 01:13:58,840
It's part of history
of <i> Wars </ i>.

1515
01:13:58,918 --> 01:14:00,476
It's like the Holy Grail.

1516
01:14:00,553 --> 01:14:03,613
It is finding Bigfoot
or the monster of Loch Ness.

1517
01:14:03,690 --> 01:14:05,920
It's like finding
the sex video of your parents.

1518
01:14:05,992 --> 01:14:09,189
Should exist as
the cultural highlight of the seventies.

1519
01:14:09,262 --> 01:14:11,025
Must be in a museum.

1520
01:14:12,332 --> 01:14:15,199
<i> Christmas 2008,

EPISODE FOUR
A NEW HOPE?

1536
01:15:13,159 --> 01:15:15,719
We all get obsessed with something.

1537
01:15:15,795 --> 01:15:18,457
Will it end the obsession
by <i> Wars </ i>?

1538
01:15:18,531 --> 01:15:20,123
I do not know.

1539
01:15:20,199 --> 01:15:23,566
How long can you see a grater
and cheese tasting to follow you?

1540
01:15:23,636 --> 01:15:25,627
- I never saw <i> Episode III </ i>.

So I see that it is impossible

1543
01:15:33,746 --> 01:15:36,715
I left it completely.
I burned all my toys.

1544
01:15:37,784 --> 01:15:39,684
I had no toys.

1545
01:15:40,052 --> 01:15:41,610
- But to have them ...
- The would burn ...

1546
01:15:41,687 --> 01:15:45,418
I do not like this.

1547
01:15:45,491 --> 01:15:48,255
I especially like Droid <i> Wars </ i>.

1548
01:15:48,327 --> 01:15:53,196
What did George Lucas
what I enjoyed ...

1549
01:15:54,534 --> 01:15:56,001

How do you thank me?

1575
01:17:02,602 --> 01:17:05,628
Do the fans of this film
need to overcome?

1576
01:17:06,772 --> 01:17:09,263
Not necessarily. There are professionals.

1577
01:17:09,342 --> 01:17:10,900
At the Cannes Film Festival ...

1578
01:17:10,977 --> 01:17:13,104
At the premiere ...
Indiana Jones 4 ...

1579
01:17:13,179 --> 01:17:15,647
... To finish the film,
someone stood up and shouted:

"George, you should stop us harm."

1581
01:17:18,284 --> 01:17:21,310

Have thought ... but immediately
Luke.

And as you ask the public:

"Who raped?"
And then you realize.

1594
01:18:00,259 --> 01:18:04,161
Indiana Jones, you look good.

No matter what I think.

What do you say?

1615
01:18:49,976 --> 01:18:53,207
When I think of Luke,
I think <i> Captain EO </ i>.

1616
01:18:53,279 --> 01:18:56,271
When I think <i> Captain EO </ i>,
I think of Michael Jackson.

1617
01:18:56,349 --> 01:18:58,124
So when I think
Michael Jackson ...

1618
01:18:58,225 --> 01:18:59,443
Disneyland ... I think.

1619
01:18:59,518 --> 01:19:00,951
When I think of Michael Jackson ...

1620
01:19:01,020 --> 01:19:03,147
I think ... and George Lucas
and <i> Captain EO </ i> ...

1621
01:19:03,222 --> 01:19:05,315
... And Disneyland
I think of my childhood.

1622
01:19:05,391 --> 01:19:07,416
Then I go into a strange place ...

1623
01:19:07,493 --> 01:19:11,156
George Lucas ... where,
my childhood and Michael Jackson.

1624
01:19:11,230 --> 01:19:12,230
G.L. - I - M.J.

1625
01:19:12,298 --> 01:19:13,663
By God!

1626
01:19:13,766 --> 01:19:17,361
I was at a convention and saw
some guys selling a shirt ...

1627
01:19:17,436 --> 01:19:19,927
... That said:
"George Lucas raped my childhood".

1628
01:19:20,006 --> 01:19:22,406
Is there a song:
<i> "George Lucas raped my childhood </ i>"?

1629
01:19:22,475 --> 01:19:25,205
# George Lucas raped our childhood #

Nobody <i> violated my childhood,

1633
01:19:36,022 --> 01:19:40,220
And frankly,
if a course George Lucas ...

1634
01:19:40,292 --> 01:19:41,759
I would like to have sex ... ...

1635
01:19:41,827 --> 01:19:44,421
Metaphorical ... with my childhood ...

1636
01:19:44,497 --> 01:19:48,160
Would be a beautiful relationship ...
consensual sexual.

1637
01:19:48,234 --> 01:19:51,863
I do not think you can say:
"George Lucas ruined my childhood" ...

1638
01:19:51,937 --> 01:19:54,098
... Because you still live your childhood.

1639
01:19:54,173 --> 01:19:55,470
You act like a child.

1640
01:19:55,541 --> 01:19:56,838
What took you children?

Or maybe, yes.

1645
01:20:06,719 --> 01:20:08,710
Although we deserved.

1646
01:20:08,788 --> 01:20:10,415
Why were dressed like ...

1647
01:20:10,489 --> 01:20:12,598
<i> ... in that part of the city,

1649
01:20:14,460 --> 01:20:16,621
And in the mind of George,
gave us what we wanted.

1650
01:20:16,696 --> 01:20:19,995
He gave us new movies.
We do not ask them to be good.

Just ask <i> Wars </ i>.

1652
01:20:22,134 --> 01:20:24,762
One can say
George Lucas is a seducer.

1653
01:20:24,837 --> 01:20:27,772
I would say that the battered woman
better example.

- Because it's a terrible story.

1658
01:20:44,323 --> 01:20:48,054
When I was in the movie, I thought:
"Damn, there goes ...

1660
01:20:50,629 --> 01:20:52,028
It was exciting.

or ruin our fun ...

1663
01:21:00,473 --> 01:21:02,566
... Or all that.

1664
01:21:03,576 --> 01:21:08,240
But just because I mocked him in my
comic strip and I want to sue me.

1665
01:21:08,314 --> 01:21:09,611
I think we are so annoying ...

1666
01:21:09,682 --> 01:21:12,515
<i> Franchise ... because the War </ i>
<i> of galaxies </ i> represents something.

1667
01:21:12,585 --> 01:21:15,577
This is what we recall as the most pure ...

1668
01:21:15,654 --> 01:21:18,953
In terms of experience ...
film. Is the base.

1669
01:21:19,024 --> 01:21:21,219
There are no villains in this story.

1670
01:21:21,293 --> 01:21:26,390
For us as fans, is better
have an executive to blame ...

1671
01:21:26,465 --> 01:21:29,332
But we do not ... ...

1672
01:21:29,401 --> 01:21:34,634
... We realize that George is
the executive and creative.

1673
01:21:34,707 --> 01:21:36,800
There are many mixed feelings.

1674
01:21:36,876 --> 01:21:42,678
Luke's own career is
as the rise and fall of Anakin.

1675
01:21:42,748 --> 01:21:44,978
I should not have been <i>
the first person to say that. </ i>

1676
01:21:45,050 --> 01:21:46,176
WIRED
GEORGE LUCAS WITHOUT THE MASK

1677
01:21:46,252 --> 01:21:50,052
<i> fought against the corporate system,
which I did not like ... </ i>

1678
01:21:50,122 --> 01:21:52,454
<i> ... and not make me happy
that corporations ... </ i>

1679
01:21:52,525 --> 01:21:54,516
<i> have taken control ...
of the film industry. </ i>

1680
01:21:54,593 --> 01:21:57,426
But now I find <i>
as president of a corporation. </ i>

1681
01:21:57,496 --> 01:21:59,760
The irony, then ...

1682
01:21:59,832 --> 01:22:04,394
Is that I became ...
on what was trying to avoid.

1683
01:22:04,970 --> 01:22:06,631
<i> That's Darth Vader. </ i>

1684
01:22:06,705 --> 01:22:09,970
<i> becomes precisely that
of what is protected. </ i>

1685
01:22:10,042 --> 01:22:13,739
You can see movies <i> War </ i>
<i> of galaxies </ i> as autobiographies.

1686
01:22:13,813 --> 01:22:17,909
There are many parallels in the first ...

1687
01:22:17,983 --> 01:22:22,386
Where Luke Skywalker is ...
a lonely teenage ...

1688
01:22:22,454 --> 01:22:27,289
<i> craves leave ...
your planet Culver City. </ i>

1689
01:22:27,393 --> 01:22:30,021
Lucas may have had that nightmare
where it enters a tree ...

1690
01:22:30,095 --> 01:22:31,790
<i> ... and see that version of himself ... </ i>

1691
01:22:31,864 --> 01:22:35,163
<i> ... as Luke sees that version of himself
which became Vader. </ i>

1692
01:22:35,234 --> 01:22:37,225
Reality check, George.

1693
01:22:37,603 --> 01:22:40,834
<i> Yes, you turned this man.
For many fans ... </ i>

1694
01:22:40,906 --> 01:22:44,569
You ... Luke's version in the tree
which is in Vader mask.

1695
01:22:44,677 --> 01:22:47,379
I wonder if his son will kill him ...

1696
01:22:47,500 --> 01:22:50,513
And then make ...
his ghost apologize.

1697
01:22:50,583 --> 01:22:52,710
I will say one thing about George Lucas.

1698
01:22:52,785 --> 01:22:55,345
Regardless
weaknesses as a filmmaker ...

1699
01:22:55,421 --> 01:22:58,754
Deserves respect ...
because it is a giant ...

1700
01:22:58,824 --> 01:23:00,223
... In the history of cinema.

1701
01:23:00,292 --> 01:23:03,352
Perhaps we feel that it can not
do something other than this series.

1702
01:23:03,429 --> 01:23:06,592
Paramount wants another franchise it.

1703
01:23:06,665 --> 01:23:12,001
<i> Distributors War </ i>
<i> of galaxies </ i> want more of this saga.

1704
01:23:12,071 --> 01:23:15,336
Much pressure to George Lucas
to make ...

1705
01:23:15,407 --> 01:23:17,500
Business ... because they are.

1706
01:23:17,576 --> 01:23:20,511
I still have something inside ...

1707
01:23:20,579 --> 01:23:22,479
... And can make another <i> American Graffiti </ i>,
<i> other THX </ i> ...

1708
01:23:22,548 --> 01:23:23,981
<i> ... And other Star Wars </ i>.

1709
01:23:24,049 --> 01:23:26,074
- No way.
- I think I could.

1710
01:23:26,151 --> 01:23:28,881
Must end with
<i> Wars </ i>.

1711
01:23:28,988 --> 01:23:32,014
I think George <i>
is a huge millionaire ... </ i>

1712
01:23:32,091 --> 01:23:35,549
<i> ... still has the soul
a hippie idealist. </ i>

1713
01:23:35,628 --> 01:23:37,357
And within that <i> hippie idealist ... </ i>

1714
01:23:37,429 --> 01:23:40,557
<i> alienated is a child ...
that used to go to the garage ... </ i>

1715
01:23:40,633 --> 01:23:44,296
<i> ... and working on engines
she felt she did not fit. </ i>

1716
01:23:44,370 --> 01:23:48,101
<i> And then it all gets
a giant corporation ... </ i>

1717
01:23:48,173 --> 01:23:49,663
<i> ... who grew up around it. </ i>

1718
01:23:49,742 --> 01:23:53,735
<i> And I think those four versions of it
fight it. </ i>

1719
01:23:53,812 --> 01:23:56,576
<i> I advocate for the little boy
that is in the middle. </ i>

1720
01:23:56,649 --> 01:24:01,177
I hope that at some point to achieve out
and make more movies.

1721
01:24:01,253 --> 01:24:03,453
No matter <i>
how many millions of dollars ... </ i>

1722
01:24:03,505 --> 01:24:05,485
<i> ... </ i> The Wars
<i> can generate ... </ i>

1723
01:24:05,557 --> 01:24:09,755
... And no matter how valuable is
the franchise ...

1724
01:24:09,828 --> 01:24:13,264
... Is not worth a tenth
of what it's worth as an artist ...

1725
01:24:13,332 --> 01:24:14,697
... And what you can do.

1726
01:24:14,767 --> 01:24:19,227
Why am I here in this quarry?

1727
01:24:19,305 --> 01:24:23,366
Why am I to George Lucas
personally?

1728
01:24:24,777 --> 01:24:27,211
The answer is simple,
and is the most important:

1729
01:24:27,279 --> 01:24:28,712
inspiration.

1730
01:24:28,781 --> 01:24:32,581
It inspired me to join YouTube,
and do what I like ...

1731
01:24:32,651 --> 01:24:38,055
... And be very good at what you know.

1732
01:24:39,224 --> 01:24:42,352
I think George Lucas
like a cluster of dreams.

1733
01:24:42,895 --> 01:24:47,457
You might think your dreams
all the time ...

1734
01:24:47,800 --> 01:24:51,827
... And I would
that share more with me.

1735
01:24:51,904 --> 01:24:53,769
SNOW BUNNY
501 st Legion of Tokyo

1736
01:24:54,573 --> 01:24:57,269
George Lucas is like air for me ...

01:24:57,343 --> 01:24:58,367
RIKA Takashiro
Toys Kotobukiya Planner

1738

Masahiro MIYAZAKI
Toys Kotobukiya Planner

1739
01:24:59,545 --> 01:25:04,107
Because I could not live ...
without the Wars.

1740
01:25:07,519 --> 01:25:10,010
The fans have not deserted.

1741
01:25:10,089 --> 01:25:14,150
And I think that's the beauty
the world of the fans ...

1742
01:25:14,226 --> 01:25:17,218
... We can forgive.

1743
01:25:17,296 --> 01:25:20,322
<i> He gave us hours of fun. </ i>

1744
01:25:20,399 --> 01:25:22,697
One hundred percent.
It was a life of joy.

1745
01:25:22,768 --> 01:25:26,033
If I saw George Lucas, would give
a big hug and give thanks.

1746
01:25:26,105 --> 01:25:28,266
Finally, after all, is a human being.

1747
01:25:28,340 --> 01:25:31,639
A human being living
exceptional circumstances.

1748
01:25:31,744 --> 01:25:34,713
If you think none of us
has the great right ...

1749
01:25:34,780 --> 01:25:36,805
Complaining ... about three films
we do not like.

1750
01:25:36,882 --> 01:25:40,477
Because we gave these three films
that we will love forever.

1751
01:25:40,552 --> 01:25:43,680
Do we pay too much to go see
these three films?

1752
01:25:44,757 --> 01:25:48,284
Did he have something better
to do at 4:00 in the morning ...

1753
01:25:48,360 --> 01:25:51,022
... From the opening night of
<i> Episode II </ i>?

1754
01:25:51,096 --> 01:25:52,120
No.

1755
01:25:52,798 --> 01:25:56,598
I could have stayed home
playing video games in the series.

1756
01:25:56,902 --> 01:25:58,893
This conversation will never disappear.

1757
01:25:58,971 --> 01:26:01,667
When we are in nursing homes
discussing things ...

1758
01:26:01,740 --> 01:26:03,037
... Talk about what went wrong ...

1759
01:26:03,108 --> 01:26:04,507
<i> ... The Phantom Menace </ i>.

1760
01:26:04,576 --> 01:26:06,771
"Why not go well?
And Jar Jar Binks? "

1761
01:26:06,845 --> 01:26:08,676
Because that's the issue.

1762
01:26:08,747 --> 01:26:12,478
Hate goes hand in hand
with an immense love for these films.

1763
01:26:12,551 --> 01:26:15,952
Can not help it. I still want
a <i> Star Wars </ i> new.

1764
01:26:16,021 --> 01:26:18,615
We are the first civilization

the fun was important.

1767
01:26:24,196 --> 01:26:28,724
And God, if we follow the
fundamental moral standards ...

1768
01:26:29,735 --> 01:26:32,363
George Lucas ... is a saint.

1769
01:26:32,438 --> 01:26:33,530
We love you, George.

1770
01:26:33,605 --> 01:26:35,095
- Yes
- We love you.

1771
01:26:35,174 --> 01:26:36,471
That summarizes everything.

1772
01:26:36,542 --> 01:26:38,066
We love you.

1773
01:26:38,677 --> 01:26:40,235
We love you, Uncle George.

1774
01:26:44,917 --> 01:26:46,782
- I have it!
- Great, baby.

1775
01:26:46,852 --> 01:26:48,012
Do not be cocky.
