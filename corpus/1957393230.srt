00:09:39,917 --> 00:09:41,333
HUBERT:
Well, what manner of man

181
00:09:41,417 --> 00:09:42,333
objects to music?

182
00:09:42,417 --> 00:09:43,250
KNIGHT:
I don't object

183
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,208
to music, Mr. Lee,
but I am well aware

184
00:09:45,291 --> 00:09:47,250
you're trying to ruin
my business to drive me out.

185
00:09:47,333 --> 00:09:49,959
♪ When you wear
your bell-bottom pants... ♪

186
00:09:50,041 --> 00:09:51,959
I'm trying to conduct
a funeral service

187
00:09:52,041 --> 00:09:53,583
for the 17-year-old daughter

188
00:09:53,667 --> 00:09:55,917
of the mayor
of Saint Augustine!

189
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,166
How would you like to kneel

190
00:09:58,250 --> 00:09:59,875
in my chapel

191
00:09:59,959 --> 00:10:02,583
beside the casket
of your daughter

192
00:10:02,667 --> 00:10:04,792
and be forced to listen
to "Oogum Boogum"?

193
00:10:04,875 --> 00:10:06,000
( record scratches )

194
00:10:10,083 --> 00:10:14,125
I will never kneel
in your chapel, Mr. Knight.

195
00:10:14,208 --> 00:10:16,917
On this you may
rely implicitly.

196
00:10:20,083 --> 00:10:21,917
EDNA:
Mr. Knight...

197
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:25,291
Mr. Knight.

198
00:10:26,625 --> 00:10:29,291
( panting )

199
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,583
Mr. Knight...

200
00:10:33,667 --> 00:10:36,917
I fear we have been
very inconsiderate.

201
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,917
Mrs. Lee, believe me

202
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,375
I harbor no ill feeling
for you or your...

203
00:10:42,458 --> 00:10:44,041
Husband.

204
00:10:46,875 --> 00:10:48,333
...family.

205
00:10:48,417 --> 00:10:49,125
Surely, we could come

206
00:10:49,375 --> 00:10:52,125
to some reasonable
accommodation.

207
00:10:52,208 --> 00:10:56,041
Of course, perhaps
you could telephone

208
00:10:56,125 --> 00:10:58,750
our office when you're
having a service.

209
00:10:58,834 --> 00:11:00,583
Thank you, Mrs. Lee.

210
00:11:00,667 --> 00:11:03,417
And we will be installing
individual speaker posts

211
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:04,500

00:11:05,625 --> 00:11:07,208
According to me, Hubert.

214
00:11:10,458 --> 00:11:11,625
If you'll excuse me.

215
00:11:11,709 --> 00:11:13,041
Gladly, you're excused.

216
00:11:14,083 --> 00:11:15,667

00:11:18,083 --> 00:11:20,458
Hubert,
you're a good, decent man.

218
00:11:20,542 --> 00:11:22,750
Act like one.

219
00:11:22,834 --> 00:11:25,375
Oh, Hubert.

220
00:11:25,458 --> 00:11:27,667
What gets into you?

221
00:11:37,875 --> 00:11:39,375
Abraham?

222
00:11:39,458 --> 00:11:40,166
Yes, Dad?

snuck in in car trunks.

00:13:00,458 --> 00:13:01,291
Maybe more.

252
00:13:01,458 --> 00:13:03,041
They're sneaking
in the exit, too.

253
00:13:03,125 --> 00:13:05,000

Louise is right.

00:13:07,959 --> 00:13:09,667
We're seriously understaffed
on weekends.

257
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:13,125
We need two registers going
Fridays and Saturdays.

Popcorn is where
we make our money.

00:13:15,041 --> 00:13:16,291

you're going to have

260
00:13:16,375 --> 00:13:17,834
to adopt at least
two more kids.

Ooh!

263
00:13:20,417 --> 00:13:21,750
I know what we really need.

264
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,959

Oh, yes... here, hold these.

You got that?

00:13:44,542 --> 00:13:46,083

281
00:13:50,291 --> 00:13:52,208
Yeah.

282
00:13:52,291 --> 00:13:54,041

Come on out of there.

288
00:14:09,792 --> 00:14:10,792
Are you... are you all right?

289
00:14:10,875 --> 00:14:11,875
Yeah.

290
00:14:11,959 --> 00:14:13,291
Now, really,
are you all right?
Yeah.

291
00:14:13,375 --> 00:14:14,875
Are you sure
you're all right, Mr...?

292
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:17,625
Maws, Pete Maws.

293
00:14:17,709 --> 00:14:18,959
Really?

294
00:14:19,041 --> 00:14:19,959
Yeah.

295
00:14:20,041 --> 00:14:22,834
Hubert T. Lee.

296
00:14:22,917 --> 00:14:24,709
Edna Lee, Abraham Lee,
Louise Janine Lee.

297
00:14:27,709 --> 00:14:28,667
How do you do?

298
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:29,458
Pleased to meet you.

299
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:31,291
I'm sorry about
the fence, Mr. Lee.

300
00:14:31,375 --> 00:14:34,041
Not at all, not at all,
don't you worry about that.

301
00:14:34,125 --> 00:14:35,125
That's not important.

302
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:37,000
This, this your drive-in?

303
00:14:37,083 --> 00:14:38,458
It's not just a
drive-in, Mr. Maws.

304
00:14:38,542 --> 00:14:40,709
You're looking at
the world's largest
movie screen...

305
00:14:40,792 --> 00:14:43,667
conceived, built, and operated
by the Hubert T. Lee family

306
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:45,000
formerly of North Carolina.

307
00:14:45,083 --> 00:14:46,041
North Carolina?

308
00:14:46,125 --> 00:14:47,166
Mm-hmm.

309
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:48,458
Where you headed,
Mr. Maws?

310
00:14:48,542 --> 00:14:50,667
I wasn't headed for
your fence, Mrs. Lee.

311
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:51,875
I'm not exactly sure

312
00:14:51,959 --> 00:14:53,041
where I'm headed.

313
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:55,125
I was just looking for
a place to park my engine.

314
00:14:55,208 --> 00:14:57,875
Do you possess any
skills, Mr. Maws?

315
00:14:57,959 --> 00:14:59,792
For instance, uh, carpentry?

316
00:14:59,875 --> 00:15:02,834
I can pound a nail,
if that's what you're asking.

317
00:15:02,917 --> 00:15:06,834
Matter of fact, I'm looking
for a job, if you're offering.

318
00:15:09,458 --> 00:15:12,041
Do you believe in
accidents, Mr. Maws?

319
00:15:12,125 --> 00:15:13,333
I believe
I just had one.

320
00:15:13,417 --> 00:15:15,625
I don't... believe
in accidents, that is.

321
00:15:15,709 --> 00:15:17,875
I believe everything
happens for a reason.

322
00:15:17,959 --> 00:15:19,834
And I believe that if you're
not just looking for a job

323
00:15:19,917 --> 00:15:22,458
but also for a new home,
you just found both.

324
00:15:22,542 --> 00:15:24,333
Both?
Mm-hmm.

325
00:15:24,417 --> 00:15:26,208
What do you think about that,
Mr. Abraham?

326
00:15:26,291 --> 00:15:27,333
My dad's
usually right.

327
00:15:27,417 --> 00:15:28,667
Your dad's
always right.

328
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:29,834
Put her there.
Come on in.

329
00:15:29,917 --> 00:15:30,834
Come on in?

330
00:15:30,917 --> 00:15:31,959
Yeah.

331
00:15:32,041 --> 00:15:33,625
HUBERT:
You're a lucky
man, Pete Maws.

332
00:15:33,709 --> 00:15:35,750
You've escaped the
"Iron Line of Necessity"

333
00:15:35,834 --> 00:15:38,000
and become part of
the "Great Wall of Life."

334
00:15:38,083 --> 00:15:40,291
Directionless just a
few short hours ago

335
00:15:40,375 --> 00:15:42,083
you are now part of
the "Grand Design."

336
00:15:42,166 --> 00:15:43,208
( chuckles )

337
00:15:44,125 --> 00:15:45,125
Well, Mrs. Lee

338
00:15:45,291 --> 00:15:47,458
you have yourself
two beautiful children.

339
00:15:47,542 --> 00:15:50,208
Miss Louise,
I believe, favors you

340
00:15:50,291 --> 00:15:51,500
and Mr. Abraham...

341
00:15:51,583 --> 00:15:52,709
his father.

342
00:15:52,792 --> 00:15:53,834
( Hubert chuckles )

343
00:15:56,583 --> 00:15:58,291
At the risk of appearing nosy

344
00:15:58,375 --> 00:16:00,041
Mr., Mr. Maws,
there's, uh...

345
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:02,458
well, there's something
about your story

346
00:16:02,542 --> 00:16:04,041
I don't quite understand.

347
00:16:04,125 --> 00:16:05,834
What's that, Mr. Lee?

348
00:16:05,917 --> 00:16:06,875
You retired from the railroad?

349
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:08,083
Yes, sir.

350
00:16:08,166 --> 00:16:10,041
On the Palm Coast Line,
in Florida?

351
00:16:10,125 --> 00:16:11,375
Yes, sir, started out in linens

352
00:16:11,458 --> 00:16:13,333
and worked my way up
through the dining car.

353
00:16:13,417 --> 00:16:15,875
And I spent the last ten years
in charge of maintenance.

354
00:16:18,083 --> 00:16:19,792
And the Palm Coast gave you
a pension?

355
00:16:19,875 --> 00:16:24,834
The Palm Coast Line is under
the mistaken impression that...

356
00:16:24,917 --> 00:16:26,333
I'm white.

357
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:29,667
You may have to explain

358
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:30,834
that one, Mr. Maws.

359
00:16:30,917 --> 00:16:32,291
Well, Mrs. Lee, I was hired

360
00:16:32,375 --> 00:16:34,333
with a bunch of boys
out of Palatka.

361
00:16:34,417 --> 00:16:37,083
And, well, I was
the only one that could write

362
00:16:37,166 --> 00:16:40,250
so I got to fill out
all the forms.

363
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:41,458
Now, you had to check either

364
00:16:41,542 --> 00:16:43,333
that you were colored
or you were white.

365
00:16:43,417 --> 00:16:46,917
At that time... I must have
been about Mr. Abraham's age...

366
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,291
and, well, I wished I was white.

367
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:52,041
So when it came down
to my own form

368
00:16:52,125 --> 00:16:54,875
well, guess which one I checked?

369
00:16:56,083 --> 00:16:57,041
Wasn't that a lie?

370
00:16:57,792 --> 00:17:00,417
Yes, that's exactly what
it was, Mr. Abraham.

371
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:01,834
Big, old white lie.

372
00:17:01,917 --> 00:17:03,208
I mean, as young as I was

373
00:17:03,291 --> 00:17:05,375
I didn't know
that there's some things

374
00:17:05,458 --> 00:17:08,125
that you just can't change
by wishing, you know?

375
00:17:08,208 --> 00:17:10,333
And later on, well,
I felt more ashamed

376
00:17:10,417 --> 00:17:12,000
about the wish than the lie

377
00:17:12,083 --> 00:17:14,458
if you follow
my meaning.

378
00:17:15,875 --> 00:17:18,709
You still look a little young
to retire, hmm?

379
00:17:18,792 --> 00:17:21,959
Well, sir,
that's another lie I told.

380
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:27,458
Instead of 14, I wrote down
that I was 40 on the form.

381
00:17:29,417 --> 00:17:30,667
Yeah, yeah, Mrs. Lee.
That's true.

382
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:34,625
You're looking at
a 65-year-old white man.

383
00:17:34,709 --> 00:17:35,542
( laughter )

384
00:17:36,375 --> 00:17:37,667
Are you, are you sure

385
00:17:37,834 --> 00:17:40,041
you're telling us the truth
about all this, Mr. Maws?

386
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:42,417
Now, would I lie to you?

387
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:44,333
( chuckling )

388
00:17:44,417 --> 00:17:46,834
Here's to retirement.

389
00:17:46,917 --> 00:17:47,875
ALL:
Yes!

390
00:17:47,959 --> 00:17:49,041
( giggling )

391
00:17:49,125 --> 00:17:51,625
♪ Joyful, joyful,
we adore Thee ♪

392
00:17:51,709 --> 00:17:55,709
♪ God of glory, Lord of love

393
00:17:55,792 --> 00:18:00,250
♪ Hearts unfold

394
00:18:00,333 --> 00:18:03,333
♪ Opening to the sun above

00:18:03,417 --> 00:18:07,417
♪ Melt the clouds

396
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:12,000
♪ Drive the dark of doubt away

397
00:18:12,083 --> 00:18:17,417
♪ Giver of immortal gladness

398
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:22,166
♪ Fill us
with the light of day ♪

399
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:25,083
PRIEST:
Let us pray.

400
00:18:25,166 --> 00:18:27,417
O Lord, be merciful
to your people.

401
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:29,083
Fill us with your gifts

402
00:18:29,166 --> 00:18:30,875
and make us always
eager to serve you

403
00:18:30,959 --> 00:18:32,166
in faith

404
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:33,667
hope and love.

405
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:35,458
( whispers ):
What's your name?

406
00:18:35,542 --> 00:18:37,208
We ask this through
Christ, our Lord...

407
00:18:37,291 --> 00:18:38,834
Amen.

408
00:18:38,917 --> 00:18:39,750
( giggles )

409
00:18:49,083 --> 00:18:51,875
A reading from the
First Epistle of Paul
to the Corinthians...

410
00:18:51,959 --> 00:18:52,875
I'm Gary.

411
00:18:52,959 --> 00:18:54,583
Gary.

412
00:18:54,667 --> 00:18:56,667
"Now I will show you
the greater way

413
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:58,291
"which surpasses all others.

414
00:18:58,375 --> 00:18:59,875
"If I speak with human tongues

415
00:18:59,959 --> 00:19:03,333
"and angelic as well,
but do not have love

416
00:19:03,417 --> 00:19:06,000
"I am a noisy gong,
a clanging cymbal.

417
00:19:06,625 --> 00:19:08,417
"If I have the gift of prophesy

418
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:10,875
"and with full knowledge
comprehend all mysteries

419
00:19:11,041 --> 00:19:13,375
"and have faith great
enough to move mountains

420
00:19:13,458 --> 00:19:17,166
"but do not have love,
I am nothing.

421
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:18,959
"Love is patient.

422
00:19:19,041 --> 00:19:21,792
"It is never self-seeking.

423
00:19:21,875 --> 00:19:23,417
"Love never fails.

424
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:25,291
"Prophesies will cease.

425
00:19:25,375 --> 00:19:27,083
"Tongues will be silent.

426
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:29,417
"Knowledge will pass away.

427
00:19:29,834 --> 00:19:30,709
"In the end

428
00:19:31,125 --> 00:19:37,458
"but three things last:
faith, hope and love.

429
00:19:37,542 --> 00:19:41,375
And the greatest
of these is love."

430
00:19:41,458 --> 00:19:44,000
( bells ringing )

431
00:19:56,458 --> 00:19:59,250
Mrs. Lee, how nice to see you.

432
00:19:59,333 --> 00:20:00,667
Mr. Knight.

433
00:20:00,875 --> 00:20:03,500
LOUISE:
Mother, can I wait for you
across the street?

434
00:20:05,917 --> 00:20:07,625
Close by, Louise.

435
00:20:07,709 --> 00:20:10,083
I don't want to have
to search for you.
Yes, Mother.

436
00:20:10,166 --> 00:20:12,792
I didn't know you were a member
of the parish, Mr. Knight.

437
00:20:12,875 --> 00:20:17,000
Oh, I belong to seven churches
and, and a synagogue.

438
00:20:17,083 --> 00:20:18,875
My vocation requires it.

439
00:20:18,959 --> 00:20:19,792
( chuckles )

440
00:20:19,875 --> 00:20:21,417
Does that make me
a hypocrite,

441
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:22,834
do you suppose?

442
00:20:22,917 --> 00:20:25,375
Well, that would be
a rather harsh judgment.

443
00:20:25,458 --> 00:20:27,250
Harsh, but perhaps just.

444
00:20:27,667 --> 00:20:32,709
Faith and I have been resolute
strangers since my wife died.

445
00:20:36,417 --> 00:20:38,250
Abraham, go keep
your sister company.

446
00:20:38,333 --> 00:20:39,500
She's got company.

447
00:20:39,583 --> 00:20:41,500
Yes, but I think she
could benefit from yours.

448
00:20:41,583 --> 00:20:42,709
Dad said not to be late.

449
00:20:42,792 --> 00:20:43,750
Go.

450
00:20:48,083 --> 00:20:49,208
Mrs. Lee

451
00:20:49,291 --> 00:20:51,542
I am happy
to run into you.

452
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:53,041
I've been wanting

453
00:20:53,125 --> 00:20:56,709
to thank you
for intervening
with your husband.

454
00:20:56,792 --> 00:21:01,542
Oh, what you were asking for
was more than reasonable.

455
00:21:01,625 --> 00:21:04,417
Mrs. Lee, might I ask you

456
00:21:04,709 --> 00:21:07,375
why he hates me so?

457
00:21:07,458 --> 00:21:11,667
Oh, now, Hubert doesn't
hate you, Mr. Knight.

458
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:13,625
He hates...

459
00:21:14,291 --> 00:21:17,333
the idea of you.

460
00:21:17,417 --> 00:21:18,583
Ah, well...

461
00:21:18,667 --> 00:21:21,041
that's reassuring.

462
00:21:21,125 --> 00:21:22,583
( chuckling )

463
00:21:22,667 --> 00:21:24,875
Have you been
down the street?

464
00:21:24,959 --> 00:21:28,250
( indistinct )

465
00:21:28,333 --> 00:21:30,458
Well, I think
it's a great success.

466
00:21:30,542 --> 00:21:32,667
( laughter )

467
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:36,917
Mother's found an
admirer, Abraham.

468
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,417
Mom loves Dad.

469
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:39,709
EDNA:
It was kind of you

470
00:21:39,792 --> 00:21:42,000
to give me that advice
about the schools.

471
00:21:42,083 --> 00:21:44,250
KNIGHT:
Oh, I'm happy to
any... anytime.

472
00:21:44,333 --> 00:21:45,583
EDNA:
I do appreciate it.

473
00:21:45,667 --> 00:21:48,291
Bye-bye.
Bye.

474
00:21:53,417 --> 00:21:55,750
Abraham, Louise.

475
00:21:55,834 --> 00:21:58,417
Mr. Knight has suggested
a school for the two of you:

476
00:21:58,500 --> 00:21:59,792
Saint Margaret.

477
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:02,041
Catholic school?

478
00:22:02,208 --> 00:22:04,458
With nuns and uniforms?

479
00:22:04,792 --> 00:22:07,208
Dad would never allow it.

480
00:22:23,542 --> 00:22:26,291
Uh-huh...

481
00:22:26,375 --> 00:22:27,709
Who's your favorite father?

482
00:22:27,917 --> 00:22:30,792
My favorite father
wouldn't make me go
to Catholic school.

483
00:22:30,875 --> 00:22:33,959
You'll have to take that up
with your favorite mother.

484
00:22:35,792 --> 00:22:37,875
All right, how old
is the earth?

485
00:22:37,959 --> 00:22:39,583
Millions
of years?
And how do we know?

486
00:22:39,667 --> 00:22:40,792
Carbon dating.

487
00:22:40,875 --> 00:22:42,625
Who's the father
of modern science?
Galileo.

488
00:22:42,709 --> 00:22:44,208
And who had Galileo
thrown in prison

489
00:22:44,291 --> 00:22:45,208
for telling the truth?

490
00:22:45,291 --> 00:22:46,166
The Pope.

491
00:22:46,458 --> 00:22:48,208
Where'd your mother
come up with this idea

492
00:22:48,291 --> 00:22:49,291
is what I'd like to know.

493
00:22:54,375 --> 00:22:56,291
All right.

494
00:22:56,417 --> 00:22:58,333
Be careful, now.

495
00:23:00,417 --> 00:23:01,917
Don't grow up now.

496
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,500
Don't you ever grow up now.

497
00:23:04,583 --> 00:23:06,041
( school bell ringing )

498
00:23:06,125 --> 00:23:07,875
( chattering )

499
00:23:14,291 --> 00:23:16,166
Sister.
Mother.

500
00:23:16,250 --> 00:23:18,166
( class murmurs )

501
00:23:18,250 --> 00:23:20,667
MOTHER SUPERIOR:
Today is a special day, class.

502
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:22,375
( pounds on chalkboard )

503
00:23:25,208 --> 00:23:26,291
Class!

504
00:23:26,375 --> 00:23:28,625
Today it is my pleasure

505
00:23:28,792 --> 00:23:32,709
to introduce to you, not one,
but two new classmates.

506
00:23:34,417 --> 00:23:35,500
Ow!

507
00:23:35,583 --> 00:23:36,709
( laughing )

508
00:23:38,208 --> 00:23:39,542
Their names are

509
00:23:39,625 --> 00:23:41,542
Abraham Jacob Lee

510
00:23:41,625 --> 00:23:42,834
and Louise Janine Lee.

511
00:23:42,917 --> 00:23:45,583
I'm sure you'll want to join me

512
00:23:45,667 --> 00:23:47,333
in welcoming them.

513
00:23:47,417 --> 00:23:49,250
( applause )

514
00:23:53,959 --> 00:23:56,166
You may go to your seats.

515
00:23:59,542 --> 00:24:01,750
GIRL ( whispering ):
I wonder what's wrong with her.

516
00:24:01,834 --> 00:24:03,625
BOY ( whispering ):
I don't know, maybe...

517
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,166
Nice shot.

518
00:24:14,250 --> 00:24:16,500
Thank you, Mother.

519
00:24:16,583 --> 00:24:18,792
Today we are reading
Romeo and Juliet

520
00:24:18,875 --> 00:24:22,041
Act Two, Scene One.

521
00:24:23,125 --> 00:24:26,875
BOY:
Use this one here.

522
00:24:26,959 --> 00:24:28,375
Come on.

523
00:24:28,458 --> 00:24:31,000
You can look on with me.

524
00:24:31,083 --> 00:24:33,208
Thank you.

525
00:24:33,291 --> 00:24:37,125
( whispers ):
Have you read ever read
Romeo and Juliet before?

526
00:24:37,208 --> 00:24:38,333
What scene is this?

527
00:24:38,417 --> 00:24:40,458
Act Two, Scene One.

528
00:24:41,333 --> 00:24:43,041
( both giggle )

529
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:46,542
LOUISE:
He dropped all this popcorn

530
00:24:46,625 --> 00:24:49,000
and then he dropped
all the money my mother gave me.

531
00:24:49,083 --> 00:24:51,542
Oh, hey, Louise,
you dropped this.

532
00:24:51,625 --> 00:24:53,750
GIRL:
See you later, Grace.

533
00:24:53,834 --> 00:24:55,291
Bye.

534
00:24:55,375 --> 00:24:58,041
( chattering )

535
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,875
Hi.

536
00:25:06,834 --> 00:25:08,583
Hi.

537
00:25:08,667 --> 00:25:10,667
Your sister's really pretty.

538
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:12,792
Why was she limping before?

539
00:25:12,875 --> 00:25:15,417
It only happens when
she's really nervous.

540
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:17,542
You'll probably
never see it again.

541
00:25:17,625 --> 00:25:21,417
Well, it was really nice
the way you took care of her.

542
00:25:23,166 --> 00:25:25,542
The nuns will make her
button her blazer.

543
00:25:25,625 --> 00:25:27,792
They think the sight
of girls' breasts

544
00:25:27,875 --> 00:25:30,709
inspires boys
to evil thoughts.

545
00:25:30,792 --> 00:25:34,333
So, are you Chinese?

546
00:25:34,417 --> 00:25:36,792
Louise and I were
born in Korea.

547
00:25:36,875 --> 00:25:38,458
We were adopted
when we were little.

548
00:25:38,542 --> 00:25:40,709
Do you know
who your parents are?

549
00:25:40,792 --> 00:25:43,291
They're Hubert
and Edna Lee.

550
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:45,542
No. I mean your real parents.

551
00:25:45,625 --> 00:25:48,500
They are our real parents.

552
00:25:48,583 --> 00:25:52,125
I'm... sorry.
I didn't mean to...

553
00:25:52,208 --> 00:25:54,125
No. That's okay.

554
00:25:55,792 --> 00:25:58,000
We probably shouldn't
even be talking.

555
00:25:58,083 --> 00:26:00,083
My father is Turner Knight,
you know.

556
00:26:00,792 --> 00:26:02,041
I know.

557
00:26:02,125 --> 00:26:04,542
I recognized you.

558
00:26:05,291 --> 00:26:08,250
Guess that makes
you a Capulet.

559
00:26:08,333 --> 00:26:10,417
And you a Montague.

560
00:26:21,375 --> 00:26:23,458
Your top button
has to be fastened.

561
00:26:23,542 --> 00:26:24,458
( school bell ringing )

562
00:26:24,542 --> 00:26:25,875
( laughter )

563
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:29,709
MAN:
Come on, you guys.

564
00:26:31,917 --> 00:26:33,208
So, what's it like

565
00:26:33,291 --> 00:26:35,542
to live in the world's
largest movie screen?

566
00:26:35,709 --> 00:26:37,166
Pretty normal mostly.

567
00:26:37,250 --> 00:26:39,917
What's it like to live
in a funeral parlor?

568
00:26:40,083 --> 00:26:42,125
Well, it's the same...
pretty normal.

569
00:26:42,208 --> 00:26:43,667
Do you sleep
in a bed or a coffin?

570
00:26:43,750 --> 00:26:45,291
( laughs )

571
00:26:46,041 --> 00:26:49,041
So, since you work in the
Flamingo Drive-in and all...

572
00:26:49,125 --> 00:26:49,709
Yeah.

573
00:26:50,041 --> 00:26:50,959
Are there any
good movies?

574
00:26:51,125 --> 00:26:51,875
No.

575
00:26:52,250 --> 00:26:53,792
No? Not at all?

576
00:26:53,875 --> 00:26:56,166
No. Not at all.

577
00:26:56,250 --> 00:26:57,667
BOY:
...cheerleading class?

578
00:26:57,750 --> 00:26:59,542
LOUISE:
Do you really think I should?

579
00:26:59,625 --> 00:27:01,834
BOY:
Yeah. I definitely think
you should.

580
00:27:01,917 --> 00:27:04,834
BOY:
They could really use
somebody like you.

581
00:27:04,917 --> 00:27:07,083
I don't know.

582
00:27:07,166 --> 00:27:08,333
LOUISE:
There's my dad.

583
00:27:08,417 --> 00:27:09,375
I'll see you later.

584
00:27:09,458 --> 00:27:10,917
BOY #2:
Take care. I'll see you.

585
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:11,792
Her name's Ashley.

586
00:27:11,875 --> 00:27:13,417
And she's on... she's like...

587
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:15,542
Oh, that's so sweet.

588
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:21,500
LOUISE:
Abe. Come on.

589
00:27:21,583 --> 00:27:22,458
Sorry. I-I have to go.

590
00:27:22,542 --> 00:27:23,500
MAN:
So long now.

591
00:27:23,583 --> 00:27:24,667
BOY #2:
Okay, I'll...

592
00:27:24,750 --> 00:27:26,083
MAN:
We've got to get going.

593
00:27:26,166 --> 00:27:27,125
BOY #2:
Okay.

594
00:27:27,208 --> 00:27:28,375
LOUISE:
Hi, Mom.

595
00:27:28,458 --> 00:27:30,458
EDNA:
How was it?

596
00:27:30,542 --> 00:27:31,375
How was your school?

597
00:27:31,458 --> 00:27:32,000
LOUISE:
Fine.

598
00:27:32,083 --> 00:27:33,583
ABRAHAM:
Great.

599
00:27:34,458 --> 00:27:36,083
You got a lot
of homework.

600
00:27:36,166 --> 00:27:37,250
Yes.
No.

601
00:27:37,458 --> 00:27:39,333
I'm glad you brought
your books home, Abe.

602
00:27:39,417 --> 00:27:40,208
I'd like to have a look
through them.

603
00:27:40,834 --> 00:27:42,375
Your father wants to check them
for Papal fallacies.

604
00:27:42,458 --> 00:27:43,750
We've already read
most of them.

605
00:27:44,083 --> 00:27:45,709
Our living room
has more books than
the school library.

606
00:27:45,917 --> 00:27:47,250
HUBERT:
See? What
did tell you?

607
00:27:47,417 --> 00:27:48,583
Maybe a donation
is in order.

608
00:27:48,667 --> 00:27:50,208
You give hand-outs
to everyone else.

609
00:27:50,291 --> 00:27:51,208
Fine with me, Edna.

610
00:27:51,417 --> 00:27:52,709
I'll start making
a list of books

611
00:27:52,792 --> 00:27:54,500
no high school library
should be without.

612
00:27:54,583 --> 00:27:56,083
D.H. Lawrence,
Nabokov, Salinger.

613
00:27:56,166 --> 00:27:57,250
So you make

614
00:27:57,333 --> 00:27:58,291
any new friends?

615
00:27:58,375 --> 00:27:59,625
Yeah.
Yeah?

616
00:27:59,709 --> 00:28:01,166
Who's the young lady, Abe?

617
00:28:01,250 --> 00:28:02,208
Which one?

618
00:28:02,417 --> 00:28:03,959
Forgive me, Father,
for I have sinned.

619
00:28:04,041 --> 00:28:05,542
HUBERT:
Under the elms

620
00:28:05,625 --> 00:28:06,542
just now.

621
00:28:06,625 --> 00:28:10,041
I think her name was Grace.

622
00:28:10,458 --> 00:28:11,667
Grace what?

623
00:28:11,750 --> 00:28:12,709
Hubert.

624
00:28:12,792 --> 00:28:13,750
Edna.

625
00:28:13,834 --> 00:28:15,000
LOUISE:
Yeah, Abraham.

626
00:28:15,083 --> 00:28:16,375
Grace what?

627
00:28:16,458 --> 00:28:19,375
How come you two
are arguing so much lately?

628
00:28:19,458 --> 00:28:20,917
Both:
Who?

629
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:42,166
( airplane whirring )

630
00:28:44,041 --> 00:28:45,208
Here he comes.

631
00:28:51,917 --> 00:28:53,917
( crowd chatting excitedly )

632
00:29:04,792 --> 00:29:06,667
MAN:
Money. Money.

633
00:29:16,125 --> 00:29:17,125
Watch this.
Watch. Watch.

634
00:29:17,208 --> 00:29:18,792
He said he's going to do
a loop-de-loop.

635
00:29:23,250 --> 00:29:24,166
Isn't that dangerous?

636
00:29:24,250 --> 00:29:25,250
Don't you worry, son.

637
00:29:25,333 --> 00:29:26,250
That is none other than

638
00:29:26,333 --> 00:29:27,375
Judge Lester at the throttle.

639
00:29:27,458 --> 00:29:29,792
He's the best circus pilot
in all of Dixie.

640
00:29:29,875 --> 00:29:33,709
Rule #1 in business, son:
Advertise, advertise, advertise.

641
00:29:33,792 --> 00:29:37,583
Rule Number Two:
Always, always hire the best.

642
00:29:43,041 --> 00:29:44,333
Hey, what's that?

643
00:29:53,667 --> 00:29:54,583
( gasping )

644
00:29:55,583 --> 00:29:57,542
Oh!

645
00:29:59,959 --> 00:30:02,417
Oh! Oh!

646
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:04,625
Whoo!

647
00:30:04,709 --> 00:30:06,083
( gasps )

648
00:30:06,166 --> 00:30:09,208
( frustrated muttering )

649
00:30:14,542 --> 00:30:16,500
Come on.

650
00:30:33,542 --> 00:30:35,375
Whoa!

651
00:30:42,083 --> 00:30:43,667
Is he okay?

652
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:45,834
Uh... I think so.

653
00:30:45,917 --> 00:30:47,542
I-I think he made it.

654
00:30:58,500 --> 00:30:59,834
Hey!

655
00:30:59,917 --> 00:31:01,000
You kids

656
00:31:01,083 --> 00:31:02,667
stay away
from there now!

657
00:31:02,750 --> 00:31:04,208
That's not a toy.

658
00:31:04,291 --> 00:31:06,834
It's not exactly a
plane anymore, either.

659
00:31:06,917 --> 00:31:11,000
Yeah. She'll need a little work
before she flies again.

660
00:31:11,083 --> 00:31:13,875
Judge Lester, this
is my son, Abraham,
you remember?

661
00:31:13,959 --> 00:31:15,667
Young man...

662
00:31:15,750 --> 00:31:18,041
you are the spitting
image of your father.

663
00:31:18,125 --> 00:31:19,458
Thanks.

664
00:31:19,542 --> 00:31:22,417
Well, it could have been worse.

665
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:24,542
How?

666
00:31:24,625 --> 00:31:26,000
You could have been killed.

667
00:31:26,083 --> 00:31:27,041
These children

668
00:31:27,125 --> 00:31:29,208
could have been killed.

669
00:31:29,291 --> 00:31:31,291
( frogs croaking )

670
00:31:31,375 --> 00:31:33,667
Could have been
better, too.

671
00:31:39,709 --> 00:31:40,583
Mr. Lee

672
00:31:40,667 --> 00:31:42,375
maybe this ain't such
a good idea.

673
00:31:42,458 --> 00:31:44,542
Come along. Edna probably
doesn't even remember you.

674
00:31:44,625 --> 00:31:46,667
It's okay. Come
on in. Come in.

675
00:31:46,750 --> 00:31:48,083
Well...

676
00:31:48,166 --> 00:31:49,959
Look what the cat dragged in.

677
00:31:50,041 --> 00:31:51,709
Sweetheart.

678
00:31:51,792 --> 00:31:52,959
( laughs )

679
00:31:53,375 --> 00:31:55,458
Hi. Now, you may
not recall, but
this is Judge Lester.

680
00:31:55,542 --> 00:31:57,375
He's the best stunt
pilot in all of Dixie.

681
00:31:57,458 --> 00:31:58,750
Oh, I remember Judge Lester.

682
00:31:58,917 --> 00:32:01,000
They finally run you out
of North Carolina, Judge.

683
00:32:02,458 --> 00:32:03,542
HUBERT:
And-and this...

684
00:32:03,625 --> 00:32:05,291
is our new projectionist,
Mr. Pete Maws.

685
00:32:05,375 --> 00:32:06,417
Hey, Judge.

686
00:32:06,583 --> 00:32:09,792
Well... an outdoor
cinematic technician.

687
00:32:11,166 --> 00:32:11,917
Whoa!

688
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,417
Is that Miss Louise there?

689
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:15,250
Why, you're even prettier
than your pictures.

690
00:32:15,333 --> 00:32:16,834
And old honest
Abe there, why

691
00:32:16,917 --> 00:32:18,750
he-he looks like a...

692
00:32:18,834 --> 00:32:20,375
a doctor.

693
00:32:20,458 --> 00:32:22,583
Hey, how about some candy,
you two, huh?

694
00:32:22,667 --> 00:32:24,792
Yeah. Take as
much as you want.

695
00:32:24,875 --> 00:32:26,792
I got connections
with all the candy kings

696
00:32:26,875 --> 00:32:27,792
of North America.

697
00:32:27,875 --> 00:32:29,500
Whoo!

698
00:32:29,583 --> 00:32:32,542
And, uh, Mrs. Lee...

699
00:32:32,625 --> 00:32:36,750
the lady of the house
always deserves a gift

700
00:32:36,834 --> 00:32:39,250
when a guest comes
for a long visit.

701
00:32:45,041 --> 00:32:47,125
A long visit?

702
00:32:47,208 --> 00:32:49,500
Um...

703
00:32:49,583 --> 00:32:51,709
I've invited the judge
to work here at the Flamingo

704
00:32:51,792 --> 00:32:53,667
for a while until he gets
his plane fixed up.

705
00:32:53,750 --> 00:32:56,000
We had a little problem in town
this afternoon.

706
00:32:56,083 --> 00:32:57,041
I know that, Hubert.

707
00:32:57,125 --> 00:32:58,792
It was all over the radio.

708
00:32:58,875 --> 00:33:00,291
You know what they call that,
Judge?

709
00:33:00,375 --> 00:33:01,250
Hmm?

710
00:33:01,333 --> 00:33:02,250
Free publicity.

711
00:33:02,333 --> 00:33:03,583
Yeah.

712
00:33:03,667 --> 00:33:05,125
Well, it's a good thing

713
00:33:05,208 --> 00:33:06,417
we just made a $5,000 donation

714
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:08,458
to the Policeman's
Benevolent Fund

715
00:33:08,542 --> 00:33:11,166
or you two overgrown adolescents
would be in jail

716
00:33:11,250 --> 00:33:13,458
for public endangerment.

717
00:33:19,875 --> 00:33:21,625
Rule #1 in business,
Abraham:

718
00:33:21,709 --> 00:33:23,583
Always make friends
with the cops.

719
00:33:23,667 --> 00:33:25,083
I thought Rule #1 was:

720
00:33:25,166 --> 00:33:26,500
"Advertise, advertise,
advertise."

721
00:33:26,583 --> 00:33:27,667
Well, Rule #2, then.

722
00:33:27,750 --> 00:33:29,750
Dad, Rule #2
is "Always hire the best."

723
00:33:29,834 --> 00:33:32,333
Okay, then, call it
2A and 2B.

724
00:33:32,417 --> 00:33:34,959
Your father's full of #2,
isn't he?

725
00:33:35,041 --> 00:33:37,041
( laughter )

726
00:33:37,125 --> 00:33:38,792
Would you take
me flying?

727
00:33:40,333 --> 00:33:41,458
EDNA:
Sweetie

728
00:33:41,542 --> 00:33:42,750
the finest stunt pilot
in all

729
00:33:42,834 --> 00:33:44,709
of Dixie just wrecked his plane.

730
00:33:44,792 --> 00:33:47,083
Oh, there's lots of planes
for hire, Mrs. Lee.

731
00:33:48,417 --> 00:33:49,709
I'll be glad to take you up.

732
00:33:49,875 --> 00:33:51,792
Louise, darling, we don't
need to discuss that now.

733
00:33:51,875 --> 00:33:53,458
Oh, Please, Daddy?
We really don't.

734
00:33:53,542 --> 00:33:54,458
Please, Daddy, please.

735
00:33:54,542 --> 00:33:55,750
Louise, no-no sugar.

736
00:33:55,834 --> 00:33:57,500
Mom, please. I want to fly
more than anything.

737
00:33:57,583 --> 00:33:58,959
You have to say yes. Please?

738
00:33:59,041 --> 00:34:00,000
Louise!

739
00:34:00,083 --> 00:34:02,000
Please?
No.

740
00:34:02,083 --> 00:34:03,458
Please?

741
00:34:03,542 --> 00:34:05,166
On one condition.

742
00:34:05,250 --> 00:34:07,208
Anything. Anything.
I promise.

743
00:34:07,291 --> 00:34:11,250
The Judge takes me up first
so I know it's safe.

744
00:34:11,333 --> 00:34:12,917
But, Mom, you're scared
of heights.

745
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,041
You won't even go
up on the roof.

746
00:34:15,125 --> 00:34:19,083
Oh, I think I'll be safe enough,
won't I, Judge?

747
00:34:53,250 --> 00:34:56,709
You're a different man up here.

748
00:34:56,792 --> 00:34:58,542
Aren't you, Judge?

749
00:34:58,625 --> 00:35:01,959
Nothing to be afraid of
in the sky, Mrs. Lee.

750
00:35:02,041 --> 00:35:05,792
It's down there
where everything gets messed up.

751
00:35:05,875 --> 00:35:06,792
Up here...

752
00:35:06,875 --> 00:35:07,667
Even I...

753
00:35:07,750 --> 00:35:09,417
don't make you nervous.

754
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:11,500
Oh, not a bit, Mrs. Lee.

755
00:35:11,583 --> 00:35:14,792
I got you just where I want you.

756
00:35:57,041 --> 00:35:59,083
What do I do?
Yeah, that's good.

757
00:35:59,166 --> 00:36:00,250
You all right?
I'm fine.

758
00:36:03,709 --> 00:36:05,709
( laughing )

759
00:36:05,792 --> 00:36:07,458
Yeah.

760
00:36:07,542 --> 00:36:08,917
Whee!

761
00:36:10,166 --> 00:36:11,709
LOUISE:
Thanks, Mom.

762
00:36:16,083 --> 00:36:17,959
( laughing )

763
00:36:21,291 --> 00:36:22,875
Come on, little lady.

764
00:36:26,583 --> 00:36:28,125
Abraham...

765
00:36:28,208 --> 00:36:30,792
you were really
worried about me,
weren't you?

766
00:36:34,583 --> 00:36:36,417
Here comes our

767
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:39,250
next aviator.

768
00:36:39,333 --> 00:36:40,750
( Abraham chuckles )

769
00:37:05,166 --> 00:37:06,375
It's gorgeous.

770
00:37:06,458 --> 00:37:08,542
( plane engine starting )

771
00:37:08,625 --> 00:37:10,291
LOUISE:
Bye!

772
00:37:10,375 --> 00:37:11,709
Bye.

773
00:37:39,875 --> 00:37:41,291
SON:
Dad, can you listen?

774
00:37:41,375 --> 00:37:44,834
DAD:
He is going to give us
a practical demonstration

775
00:37:44,917 --> 00:37:46,750
of what I feel safe
in saying

776
00:37:46,834 --> 00:37:49,208
is a pretty exciting
birthday present.

777
00:37:49,291 --> 00:37:52,083
SON:
Dad, we need to talk
about this for a second.

778
00:37:52,166 --> 00:37:54,500
DAD:
I can't hold them
much longer, Ben.

779
00:37:54,583 --> 00:37:55,875
You'd better get out here.

780
00:37:55,959 --> 00:37:57,709
SON:
I'd like to discuss this.

781
00:37:57,792 --> 00:37:59,959
Hey, you're flexing
my face.
Air.

782
00:38:01,125 --> 00:38:04,041
GARY:
Hey, fellas,
that's $3.75.

783
00:38:04,125 --> 00:38:06,083
Oh, come on, man.
Give us a break.

784
00:38:06,166 --> 00:38:08,625
Admission is one and a quarter
times three.

785
00:38:08,709 --> 00:38:09,917
Makes $3.75, fellas.

786
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:10,750
Ah, man.

787
00:38:10,834 --> 00:38:12,291
BOY:
Come on, fellas.

788
00:38:12,375 --> 00:38:13,667
Let's bug out...

789
00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:16,458
Come on, baby.

790
00:38:16,542 --> 00:38:18,166
ABRAHAM:
Thanks a lot, guys.

791
00:38:18,250 --> 00:38:19,250
Enjoy the show.

792
00:38:21,041 --> 00:38:22,542
This remarkable young man

793
00:38:22,625 --> 00:38:24,500
is going to perform for you...

794
00:38:24,583 --> 00:38:27,166
I think your sister's
in love with me.

795
00:38:27,250 --> 00:38:29,000
Don't you?

796
00:38:29,083 --> 00:38:30,125
No.

797
00:38:32,375 --> 00:38:33,959
Not even a little?

798
00:38:34,041 --> 00:38:36,917
She loves the fact
that you love her.

799
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,959
That's not the same
thing, is it?

800
00:38:39,041 --> 00:38:40,834
She wants to be
an actress.

801
00:38:40,917 --> 00:38:42,667
That way everybody
will love her.

802
00:38:42,750 --> 00:38:44,625
You could be one
of the everybody.

803
00:38:44,709 --> 00:38:47,291
What I want to be
is the only body.

804
00:38:47,375 --> 00:38:49,041
( laughing )

805
00:38:54,667 --> 00:38:57,750
( coins clanking )

806
00:39:11,083 --> 00:39:12,166
All right...

807
00:39:12,250 --> 00:39:13,583
spill it.

808
00:39:13,667 --> 00:39:14,750
What?

809
00:39:14,834 --> 00:39:15,792
Whatever's wrong.

810
00:39:15,875 --> 00:39:18,041
You've been moping
since yesterday.

811
00:39:19,917 --> 00:39:22,208
You regret now
you didn't go flying.

812
00:39:23,250 --> 00:39:24,375
No.

813
00:39:25,750 --> 00:39:27,542
What then?

814
00:39:27,625 --> 00:39:31,041
I wasn't supposed to know
about you and Grace Knight?

815
00:39:31,125 --> 00:39:32,208
Is that it?

816
00:39:32,291 --> 00:39:34,625
How did you find out?

817
00:39:34,709 --> 00:39:36,625
You didn't invent

818
00:39:36,709 --> 00:39:38,375
falling in love, Abraham.

819
00:39:39,792 --> 00:39:42,333
You going to tell Dad?

820
00:39:42,417 --> 00:39:44,208
You're going to.

821
00:39:50,083 --> 00:39:52,000
Why not?

822
00:39:52,083 --> 00:39:54,333
Shall I tell you why not?

823
00:39:55,625 --> 00:39:59,542
You're not going to tell him
because you love him, right?

824
00:39:59,625 --> 00:40:02,208
Because you're crazy
about Grace.

825
00:40:02,291 --> 00:40:04,041
And because telling
your father

826
00:40:04,125 --> 00:40:06,333
would serve no
useful purpose.

827
00:40:10,458 --> 00:40:12,542
Do you like Turner Knight?

828
00:40:12,625 --> 00:40:16,125
Yes, Abraham, I do.

829
00:40:18,291 --> 00:40:21,792
Why do you have to talk to him
every Sunday after church?

830
00:40:21,875 --> 00:40:24,917
I think I just answered
that question.

831
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,291
Were you paying attention?

832
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:34,959
Abraham, look at me.

833
00:40:36,375 --> 00:40:37,583
Look at me.

834
00:40:37,667 --> 00:40:40,125
Turner Knight

835
00:40:40,208 --> 00:40:43,083
is a lonely man
in need of a friend.

836
00:40:43,166 --> 00:40:47,834
That's all we are though
if that's what's worrying you.

837
00:40:51,959 --> 00:40:53,250
I haven't told your father

838
00:40:53,333 --> 00:40:55,458
about my friendship
with Mr. Knight.

839
00:40:57,166 --> 00:41:00,333
The same reason you haven't
told him about Grace

840
00:41:00,417 --> 00:41:03,125
because no possible good
could come of it.

841
00:41:03,208 --> 00:41:04,333
Keeping a secret...

842
00:41:04,875 --> 00:41:08,291
isn't that the same as a lie?

843
00:41:08,375 --> 00:41:09,959
Abraham...

844
00:41:10,041 --> 00:41:12,125
( sighs )

845
00:41:12,208 --> 00:41:13,583
your father's right.

846
00:41:13,667 --> 00:41:16,959
We shouldn't be sending you
to a Catholic school.

847
00:41:17,041 --> 00:41:19,542
You were born a Jesuit.

848
00:41:19,625 --> 00:41:21,959
( laughs )

849
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:26,000
Whoa.

850
00:41:26,166 --> 00:41:26,959
Man:
Run. Run.

851
00:41:27,041 --> 00:41:29,750
( can clanking )

852
00:41:29,834 --> 00:41:31,625
HUBERT:
Abraham
Easy.

853
00:41:31,709 --> 00:41:34,542
don't, uh... okay.

854
00:41:34,625 --> 00:41:35,792
Here.

855
00:41:35,875 --> 00:41:37,000
This boy...

856
00:41:37,083 --> 00:41:38,250
he's either
real brave or...

857
00:41:38,333 --> 00:41:40,125
he don't understand
too good.

858
00:41:40,208 --> 00:41:42,667
PETE:
That boy's name
is Abraham.

859
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:43,917
And he's smart enough

860
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,625
not to drop that crate
in the first place.

861
00:41:45,709 --> 00:41:47,834
You know what
would be extra neat?

862
00:41:48,417 --> 00:41:49,792
Set them babies off

863
00:41:49,875 --> 00:41:51,709
from the top
of the screen.

864
00:42:01,875 --> 00:42:03,333
Too dangerous.

865
00:42:05,417 --> 00:42:06,834
Let's just
go along

866
00:42:06,917 --> 00:42:08,041
as we planned, okay?

867
00:42:08,125 --> 00:42:09,709
Set them off
from the barge.

868
00:42:09,792 --> 00:42:11,166
Just in case
anything happens...

869
00:42:11,250 --> 00:42:12,041
there's an accident
or something

870
00:42:12,250 --> 00:42:13,417
it happens right
over the water.

871
00:42:13,959 --> 00:42:15,792
Now, if something
goes wrong up there

872
00:42:16,250 --> 00:42:18,792
it's over a crowd
of people.

873
00:42:18,875 --> 00:42:19,792
( groans )

874
00:42:19,875 --> 00:42:21,333
Pete's right.

875
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:23,959
Well, I just don't see
what's going to go wrong,
I guess.

876
00:42:24,041 --> 00:42:26,542
So, exactly who makes
the decisions around here?

877
00:42:26,625 --> 00:42:28,375
I do.

878
00:42:28,458 --> 00:42:30,417
And I like the idea
as much as you do, Judge

879
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:31,667
but Pete's right.

880
00:42:32,166 --> 00:42:34,750
We're gonna fire the rockets
off the barge, like we planned.

881
00:42:35,625 --> 00:42:37,208
( groans )

882
00:42:37,291 --> 00:42:38,625
Except for the finale.

883
00:42:40,041 --> 00:42:41,750
I don't see where
it'd hurt to shoot

884
00:42:41,834 --> 00:42:43,458
the last four Rebel Dogs
off the roof.

885
00:42:43,542 --> 00:42:45,583
Just when folks think
it's all over

886
00:42:45,667 --> 00:42:46,542
bang, bang, bang!

887
00:42:46,625 --> 00:42:47,583
Bang, bang.
Right in a row.

888
00:42:47,667 --> 00:42:48,458
Right overhead.

889
00:42:48,709 --> 00:42:50,458
Heck, that'd bring down
the house.

890
00:42:50,625 --> 00:42:52,583
( laughing )

891
00:42:52,834 --> 00:42:54,208
It's your house.

892
00:42:56,667 --> 00:42:59,500
( laughing )

893
00:43:04,041 --> 00:43:06,125
Are you ready
for the biggest

894
00:43:06,208 --> 00:43:08,709
fireworks display ever witnessed
in the great state

895
00:43:08,792 --> 00:43:09,709
of Florida, huh?

896
00:43:09,792 --> 00:43:11,375
The line in front
of the snack bar

897
00:43:11,458 --> 00:43:13,250
is going to wind halfway
to Jacksonville, son.

898
00:43:13,333 --> 00:43:15,000
And you'll be glad
to know that I hired

899
00:43:15,083 --> 00:43:16,458
I hired two extra
girls to help.

900
00:43:16,542 --> 00:43:18,208
That way I can emcee things

901
00:43:18,291 --> 00:43:19,667
instead of being stuck
behind the counter.

902
00:43:19,750 --> 00:43:21,458
Uh, uh, Abraham, could...?

903
00:43:27,792 --> 00:43:29,083
Yep...

904
00:43:29,166 --> 00:43:30,583
about the finale...

905
00:43:30,667 --> 00:43:31,291
Yeah, Dad.

906
00:43:31,917 --> 00:43:33,250
I don't see what
where it's necessary

907
00:43:33,333 --> 00:43:34,792
to tell your mother
about what we're planning.

908
00:43:35,125 --> 00:43:37,750
Oh, you mean shooting
the Rebel Dogs off the roof
instead of the barge?

909
00:43:37,834 --> 00:43:38,792
Shh, shh, shh.

910
00:43:40,208 --> 00:43:41,917
Why, thank you.
Here.

911
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,375
You want me
to lie

912
00:43:43,458 --> 00:43:44,542
to Mom?
No.

913
00:43:44,625 --> 00:43:47,333
No, no, not lie.

914
00:43:47,417 --> 00:43:48,542
Just...

915
00:43:48,625 --> 00:43:49,250
Keep a secret?

916
00:43:49,583 --> 00:43:51,291
Exactly. A small secret.

917
00:43:51,375 --> 00:43:54,250
A small, insignificant
little secret.

918
00:43:54,333 --> 00:43:57,041
Isn't a secret
the same as a lie?

919
00:43:59,208 --> 00:44:01,625
I just don't see the point
in worrying her.

920
00:44:01,709 --> 00:44:02,583
Do you?

921
00:44:08,417 --> 00:44:10,250
Hi.

922
00:44:10,333 --> 00:44:11,959
Oh, you-you
like the green?

923
00:44:12,041 --> 00:44:13,542
I prefer the red.
Mm-hmm.

924
00:44:14,709 --> 00:44:15,458
Hello, sugar.

925
00:44:15,667 --> 00:44:17,959
Hot as a biscuit
today, isn't it?

926
00:44:18,041 --> 00:44:19,583

927
00:44:19,667 --> 00:44:21,291

( seagulls singing )

929
00:44:38,041 --> 00:44:40,166
What?

930
00:44:40,250 --> 00:44:43,417
It's nothing.

931
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:45,750
I just hate lying
to my father.

932
00:44:45,834 --> 00:44:47,250
Well... it's not a lie.

933
00:44:47,333 --> 00:44:48,959
You didn't lie to him.

934
00:44:49,041 --> 00:44:50,917
Abraham, I snuck out
of the house.

935
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:52,750
If I'd asked
for his permission

936
00:44:52,834 --> 00:44:53,917
he would have said no.

937
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:57,458
Well, they keep secrets,
too, you know?

938
00:44:59,291 --> 00:45:00,500
Who?

939
00:45:00,583 --> 00:45:02,208
My parents.

940
00:45:19,583 --> 00:45:24,125
What are those lights
out on the water?

941
00:45:24,208 --> 00:45:26,041
They're shrimp boats.

942
00:45:26,125 --> 00:45:29,000
They like to
fish at night.

943
00:45:29,083 --> 00:45:32,250
The shrimp are attracted
to the light.

944
00:45:33,959 --> 00:45:36,250
It's all so beautiful.

945
00:45:36,333 --> 00:45:39,291

we're here.

than we usually do
in a good week.

1083
00:52:57,083 --> 00:52:59,125
Subtract the cost of a new roof

1084
00:52:59,208 --> 00:53:01,625
for the Knight Funeral Home,
and what did we make?

1085
00:53:01,709 --> 00:53:04,291
Well, that's why we have
insurance, sweetheart

1086
00:53:04,375 --> 00:53:05,083
because accidents happen.

1087
00:53:05,166 --> 00:53:06,792
Oh, I'm sorry, Hubert.

1088
00:53:06,875 --> 00:53:08,667
Aren't you the one
that's always saying

1089
00:53:08,750 --> 00:53:10,000
there's no such thing
as an accident?

1090
00:53:10,083 --> 00:53:11,250
Or was that somebody else?

1091
00:53:11,750 --> 00:53:13,709
Turner Knight does
not need to worry.

1092
00:53:13,792 --> 00:53:14,875
He'll get his new roof.

1093
00:53:14,959 --> 00:53:16,041
That is not the point.

1094
00:53:16,583 --> 00:53:18,750
Good grief!

1095
00:53:18,917 --> 00:53:21,333
We almost burned
that man's house down.

1096
00:53:21,417 --> 00:53:22,834
If it hadn't rained when it did

1097
00:53:22,917 --> 00:53:24,709
that's exactly
what we'd be guilty of.

1098
00:53:24,792 --> 00:53:29,000
You did a bad
thing, Hubert.

1099
00:53:29,083 --> 00:53:32,542
You did it secretly,
because you knew I'd object.

1100
00:53:32,625 --> 00:53:33,500
And you!

1101
00:53:34,083 --> 00:53:35,333
You kept the secret.

1102
00:53:35,417 --> 00:53:38,417
It's not like you don't have
secrets, too, Mother.

1103
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:45,083
I don't know what
you're talking about, Louise.

1104
00:53:45,166 --> 00:53:46,875
And do you know what?
Neither do you.

1105
00:53:46,959 --> 00:53:48,125
Now, you go upstairs
to your room

1106
00:53:48,208 --> 00:53:50,333
and you think about that
for a little while.

1107
00:53:58,834 --> 00:54:00,959
Abraham, you are not excused.

1108
00:54:03,458 --> 00:54:07,417
Don't you ever expect me
to apologize to Turner Knight.

1109
00:54:07,583 --> 00:54:08,583
EDNA:
I've already apologized.

1110
00:54:08,667 --> 00:54:09,583
What I want is
for you to quit

1111
00:54:10,083 --> 00:54:12,583
this senseless feud,
and leave the poor man alone.

1112
00:54:17,667 --> 00:54:21,208
All this is unnecessary, Hubert.

1113
00:54:38,500 --> 00:54:40,875
May I be excused?

1114
00:54:40,959 --> 00:54:42,125
Yes.

you need a job.

I don't need one.
I want one.

home in the afternoon.

1257
01:03:07,166 --> 01:03:09,625
Huh...

1258
01:03:11,709 --> 01:03:12,709
Anyway...

1259
01:03:12,792 --> 01:03:14,250
feast your eyes on this.
Come here.

1260
01:03:14,333 --> 01:03:15,625
Come here, come here, come here.

1261
01:03:15,709 --> 01:03:17,625
Come on,
come on,
come on.

1262
01:03:19,542 --> 01:03:20,959
Not only is he
the world's largest

1263
01:03:21,041 --> 01:03:23,875
freestanding neon cowboy,
you know what else he is?

1264
01:03:25,250 --> 01:03:27,208
That's right, Abraham.

1265
01:03:27,291 --> 01:03:28,125
He's for sale.

1266
01:03:28,208 --> 01:03:29,291
But I like our flamingo.

1267
01:03:29,375 --> 01:03:30,250
I'm not talking
about getting rid

1268
01:03:30,333 --> 01:03:31,458
of the flamingo.

1269
01:03:31,667 --> 01:03:32,500
I don't get it.

1270
01:03:33,875 --> 01:03:36,083
What are we going to do
with a cowboy?

1271
01:03:36,166 --> 01:03:37,667
Hmm...

1272
01:03:40,166 --> 01:03:42,458
♪ One, two, three, four

1273
01:03:42,542 --> 01:03:45,125
♪ Sha, la, la-la-la-la,

1274
01:03:45,208 --> 01:03:47,625
HUBERT:
I happen to own
this piece of land right here.

1275
01:03:47,709 --> 01:03:49,333
KNIGHT:
This will not stay
on my property.

1276
01:03:49,417 --> 01:03:51,208
( arguing )

1277
01:03:51,291 --> 01:03:52,834
LOUISE:
Uh-oh.

1278
01:03:52,917 --> 01:03:54,625
♪ Hey, hey, hey

1279
01:03:54,709 --> 01:03:57,417

1280
01:03:57,500 --> 01:03:59,000
HUBERT:
You must think I'm crazy.

1281
01:03:59,083 --> 01:04:01,333
MAN 2:
Please yourself.

1282
01:04:01,417 --> 01:04:02,333
HUBERT:
Here you go.

1283
01:04:02,417 --> 01:04:03,500
Thank you
very, very much.

1284
01:04:03,834 --> 01:04:05,792
I appreciate you guys
and getting it done so quickly.

1285
01:04:05,875 --> 01:04:10,417
Okay, we'll see you.
All right, nice job.
Okay, thank you.

1286
01:04:10,500 --> 01:04:12,667
OFFICER:
Now, Mr. Knight,
is there going to be

1287
01:04:12,750 --> 01:04:15,375
any more problem
here today?

1288
01:04:15,458 --> 01:04:16,417
Mr. Knight?

1289
01:04:16,709 --> 01:04:18,583
No more trouble, Cal,
I can promise you that.

1290
01:04:19,625 --> 01:04:20,750
Mr. Knight and I
are going to establish

1291
01:04:21,083 --> 01:04:23,709
a peaceable kingdom
right here in the
Sunshine State.

1292
01:04:24,542 --> 01:04:26,959
Right, partner?

1293
01:04:28,917 --> 01:04:29,834
Hey, whoa!

1294
01:04:29,917 --> 01:04:31,000
Back up! Back up!

1295
01:04:31,083 --> 01:04:32,125
Come on!
Come on!

1296
01:04:32,208 --> 01:04:33,375
Hey, back off!
Let go!

1297
01:04:33,458 --> 01:04:35,083
Hey! Whoa!
Come on, now!

1298
01:04:35,166 --> 01:04:38,000
Hey, hey, back off!
Back off!

1299
01:04:38,083 --> 01:04:39,834
All right, Hubert...

1300
01:04:39,917 --> 01:04:41,083
that does it.

1301
01:04:44,792 --> 01:04:48,166
HUBERT:
Do I or do I not have a
perfectly legal right to erect

1302
01:04:48,250 --> 01:04:49,208
a sign on
my own property?

1303
01:04:49,291 --> 01:04:50,542
You have every legal right,
Hubert.

1304
01:04:50,625 --> 01:04:52,041
No one's saying
you don't own the land.

1305
01:04:52,125 --> 01:04:54,375
Except for the one tiny acre
Turner's business is on

1306
01:04:54,458 --> 01:04:55,583
you own everything
around here.

1307
01:04:55,667 --> 01:04:57,166
Oh, so he's "Turner"
now, is he?

1308
01:04:57,250 --> 01:04:58,500
And what does
he call you? "Edna"?

1309
01:04:58,583 --> 01:05:00,041
Don't change the subject,
Hubert!

1310
01:05:00,125 --> 01:05:02,500
You're a rich man
and you're abusing your power.

1311
01:05:02,583 --> 01:05:04,417
What's worse,
all you're really proving

1312
01:05:04,500 --> 01:05:05,750
is how small you can be.

1313
01:05:05,917 --> 01:05:07,834
You're still angry because
Turner Knight came over here

1314
01:05:07,917 --> 01:05:09,458
and helped us out
when we needed it.

1315
01:05:09,542 --> 01:05:12,291
Oh, Hubert Lee needed
Turner Knight? Ha!

1316
01:05:12,375 --> 01:05:14,166
You're moving that cowboy.

1317
01:05:14,250 --> 01:05:15,458
When pigs fly, Edna.

1318
01:05:15,542 --> 01:05:16,875
Not only are
they going to fly

1319
01:05:16,959 --> 01:05:18,917
they're going to fly
first thing tomorrow morning.

1320
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:20,041
When I get home
from school

1321
01:05:20,208 --> 01:05:22,250
I expect to see the air
full of flying pigs.

1322
01:05:22,417 --> 01:05:25,417
Well, that's just too bad
if he can't take a joke.

1323
01:05:25,500 --> 01:05:26,458
( grunts )

1324
01:05:26,542 --> 01:05:27,834
I just... ( grunts )

1325
01:05:29,041 --> 01:05:33,083
I'm never going
to see Grace again.

1326
01:05:41,291 --> 01:05:42,875
( horses whinny )

1327
01:05:45,625 --> 01:05:47,125
Sorry about that bump.

1328
01:05:51,333 --> 01:05:54,583
MAN:
Are you going to come up here
and help me or not?

1329
01:05:54,667 --> 01:05:57,834
MAN 2:
I'm a passenger, not a driver.

1330
01:05:57,917 --> 01:05:59,250
Hyah!

1331
01:06:01,834 --> 01:06:04,291
( horses whinny )

1332
01:06:04,375 --> 01:06:06,166
( laughs )

1333
01:06:52,709 --> 01:06:54,959
( electrical buzzing )

1334
01:07:09,041 --> 01:07:10,959
Ow! Ow!

1335
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:16,959
( grunts )

1336
01:07:28,250 --> 01:07:29,625
Actor:
Hey, grandpa...

1337
01:07:57,959 --> 01:08:00,250
( dog barks in distance )

1338
01:08:18,750 --> 01:08:21,166
( Edna panting )

1339
01:08:24,834 --> 01:08:26,083
You wouldn't think it

1340
01:08:26,166 --> 01:08:29,333
but this is much scarier
than flying in a plane.

1341
01:08:39,667 --> 01:08:44,125
So, you feel like
talking about it?

1342
01:08:44,375 --> 01:08:47,625
What's there to talk about?

1343
01:08:47,709 --> 01:08:48,875
We're freaks.

1344
01:08:49,458 --> 01:08:51,333
That's what you think?

1345
01:08:52,959 --> 01:08:55,083
Mom, we live in a movie screen.

1346
01:08:55,375 --> 01:08:56,792
People are laughing at us

1347
01:08:56,875 --> 01:08:58,500
and everybody thinks
we're crazy.

1348
01:08:58,667 --> 01:08:59,709
Who thinks we're crazy?

1349
01:08:59,792 --> 01:09:02,333
Name one person
who thinks we're crazy.

1350
01:09:06,417 --> 01:09:09,709
Everybody thinks... Dad's crazy.

1351
01:09:09,792 --> 01:09:12,333
Uh-huh.

1352
01:09:12,417 --> 01:09:14,834
Why did he do it?

1353
01:09:14,917 --> 01:09:17,375
Put the cowboy there?

1354
01:09:23,166 --> 01:09:24,500
Like most people

1355
01:09:24,583 --> 01:09:27,291
your father's... complicated.

1356
01:09:27,375 --> 01:09:28,667
I don't want him
to be complicated

1357
01:09:28,750 --> 01:09:31,583
and I don't want him
to be crazy.

1358
01:09:31,667 --> 01:09:34,083
Because if he's crazy,
then you're crazy to love him.

1359
01:09:34,166 --> 01:09:36,083
Abraham...

1360
01:09:40,709 --> 01:09:47,000
your father went halfway around
the world to fight a war...

1361
01:09:47,083 --> 01:09:51,291
and every minute he was there,
he was surrounded by death.

1362
01:09:51,375 --> 01:09:53,875
A lot of men brought that death
home with them

1363
01:09:53,959 --> 01:09:54,875
but not your father.

1364
01:09:54,959 --> 01:09:57,333
He brought life...

1365
01:09:57,417 --> 01:10:01,291
two lives:
yours and your sister's.

1366
01:10:05,417 --> 01:10:08,458
There are times, like this
afternoon with the cowboy

1367
01:10:08,542 --> 01:10:09,875
when your father will follow
a notion

1368
01:10:09,959 --> 01:10:12,458
that seems a bit nutty, maybe.

1369
01:10:12,583 --> 01:10:17,458
And there are times
I would like to wring his neck.

1370
01:10:17,542 --> 01:10:20,333
But, sweetie, that's love.

1371
01:10:22,834 --> 01:10:24,917
I love your father

1372
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:27,834
and so do you.

1373
01:10:29,917 --> 01:10:34,500
Every now and then Hubert Lee
needs to be saved from himself

1374
01:10:34,583 --> 01:10:38,375
but that's my job.

1375
01:10:38,458 --> 01:10:40,709
You want to make a little wager

1376
01:10:40,792 --> 01:10:42,917
what side of the highway
that big ugly cowboy will be on

1377
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:43,834
this time tomorrow?

1378
01:10:46,166 --> 01:10:48,333
No.

1379
01:10:48,417 --> 01:10:50,041
That's where you're smart.

1380
01:10:50,125 --> 01:10:55,250
♪ For goodness' sake,
I got the hippie-hippie shakes ♪

1381
01:10:55,333 --> 01:10:58,417

01:11:00,333 --> 01:11:02,083

01:11:17,375 --> 01:11:21,291
Mom, can I fly
again, please?

1387
01:11:21,375 --> 01:11:23,625
You'll have to
ask the Judge.

1388
01:11:27,125 --> 01:11:30,458
You should go up,
too, sweetie.

1389
01:11:30,542 --> 01:11:32,250
Flying gives you

1390
01:11:32,333 --> 01:11:36,875
the most astonishing feeling
of... freedom.

1391
01:11:36,959 --> 01:11:39,208
It's almost like
you're not really tied

1392
01:11:39,291 --> 01:11:40,458
to anything down here.

1393
01:11:40,542 --> 01:11:43,417
I like it down here.

1394
01:11:43,500 --> 01:11:45,583
I don't want it
to be different.

1395
01:11:49,875 --> 01:11:51,125
LESTER:
Whoo!

1396
01:11:51,208 --> 01:11:55,083
Hold on, now. Here we go!

1397
01:12:18,375 --> 01:12:24,083
So, was it fun?

1398
01:12:24,166 --> 01:12:25,208
( sighs )

1399
01:12:25,291 --> 01:12:26,417
I just hope

1400
01:12:26,583 --> 01:12:30,208
falling in love will be
as exciting as flying...

1401
01:12:30,291 --> 01:12:33,250
but I just know it won't.

1402
01:12:33,333 --> 01:12:38,792
Abraham, I'd like
to ask your opinion
about something.

1403
01:12:38,875 --> 01:12:42,041
Turner Knight wants to put in
a cemetery

1404
01:12:42,125 --> 01:12:44,792
in back of his funeral home.

1405
01:12:44,875 --> 01:12:46,667
For the last few months,
he's been after me

1406
01:12:46,750 --> 01:12:49,625
to sell him a parcel
of our land.

1407
01:12:49,709 --> 01:12:54,041
But you don't have
to sell it to him, do you?

1408
01:12:54,125 --> 01:12:55,709
Legally, no.

1409
01:12:55,792 --> 01:12:59,959
No, but he did do us a favor
with that lady who died

1410
01:13:00,041 --> 01:13:04,250
and so now he figures
I owe him.

1411
01:13:04,333 --> 01:13:07,125
What does Mom think?

1412
01:13:07,208 --> 01:13:09,375
Well, I have
to hand it to him.

1413
01:13:09,458 --> 01:13:11,291
He never mentioned
it to your mother.

1414
01:13:11,375 --> 01:13:15,417
I think you should
sell him the land.

1415
01:13:15,500 --> 01:13:20,875
Yes. Yes, you're
probably right.

1416
01:13:20,959 --> 01:13:24,834
But I can't.

1417
01:13:24,917 --> 01:13:27,750
Because if I do, he'll stay.

1418
01:13:34,083 --> 01:13:36,542
Then again, maybe I'm the one
who should give up.

1419
01:13:36,625 --> 01:13:38,417
Give up what?

1420
01:13:38,500 --> 01:13:40,417
Well, the Flamingo,
for one thing.

1421
01:13:40,500 --> 01:13:41,667
I mean...

1422
01:13:41,750 --> 01:13:43,333
more drive-ins
close down every year.

1423
01:13:43,417 --> 01:13:46,500
Some people say
there's no future in it

1424
01:13:46,583 --> 01:13:48,750
and they-they could be right.

1425
01:13:48,834 --> 01:13:50,083
But it's our home.

1426
01:13:50,166 --> 01:13:52,000
The best home in the world.

1427
01:13:54,542 --> 01:13:56,750
Yeah. That's true.

1428
01:13:59,959 --> 01:14:02,291
Dad?

1429
01:14:02,375 --> 01:14:05,291
Mom never liked Turner Knight,
you know.

1430
01:14:05,375 --> 01:14:08,667
She loves you.

1431
01:14:08,750 --> 01:14:10,709
Why?

1432
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:14,125
Haven't you ever wondered why

1433
01:14:14,208 --> 01:14:18,041
your mother could love
a man like... like me?

1434
01:14:18,125 --> 01:14:20,625
No.

1435
01:14:23,333 --> 01:14:24,417
( plane whirring )

1436
01:14:24,500 --> 01:14:25,625
Here she comes!

1437
01:14:25,709 --> 01:14:27,625
She's coming back.

1438
01:14:27,709 --> 01:14:31,208
Of course she is.

1439
01:15:16,917 --> 01:15:18,875
When do you think your
husband might be willing

1440
01:15:18,959 --> 01:15:21,709
to discontinue his feud?

1441
01:15:21,792 --> 01:15:26,375
With Hubert, one... never knows.

1442
01:15:26,458 --> 01:15:30,542
He's nothing if not
full of surprises.

1443
01:15:30,625 --> 01:15:34,208
Which is...

1444
01:15:34,291 --> 01:15:37,333
one of the reasons I love him.

1445
01:15:41,375 --> 01:15:44,625
I have a confession
to make...

1446
01:15:44,709 --> 01:15:47,125
which shames me.

1447
01:15:49,291 --> 01:15:54,125
Your husband has not
hated me more than
I have hated him.

1448
01:15:56,458 --> 01:15:59,500
No man should
be so lucky.

1449
01:16:03,917 --> 01:16:06,750
I've often wondered,
Mr. Knight...

1450
01:16:06,834 --> 01:16:09,083
Would you call me Turner?

1451
01:16:09,166 --> 01:16:12,000
If I promise never
to embarrass you again

1452
01:16:12,083 --> 01:16:14,375
would you do me that honor?

1453
01:16:14,458 --> 01:16:17,417
I've often wondered, Turner

1454
01:16:17,500 --> 01:16:19,667
does Grace resemble

1455
01:16:19,750 --> 01:16:21,792
her mother?

1456
01:16:23,834 --> 01:16:26,083
More and more every day.

1457
01:16:30,375 --> 01:16:32,250
She was so...

1458
01:16:41,917 --> 01:16:44,250
I have been slow to understand
that for me

1459
01:16:44,333 --> 01:16:45,875
there will never be another.

1460
01:16:48,333 --> 01:16:50,959
And I take your point, Edna...

1461
01:16:54,834 --> 01:16:56,917
that I have been lucky, too.

1462
01:17:04,291 --> 01:17:06,125
Very nice.

1463
01:17:06,291 --> 01:17:07,875
Very nice.
It's very impressive.

1464
01:17:07,959 --> 01:17:10,375
All right, well, let me show you
how this deal works.

1465
01:17:10,458 --> 01:17:11,375
Step over here.

1466
01:17:11,458 --> 01:17:12,875
Oh, watch the wire.

1467
01:17:12,959 --> 01:17:14,875
Oh!

1468
01:17:17,583 --> 01:17:19,625
Okay, you got your two buttons.

1469
01:17:19,709 --> 01:17:21,792
They're marked #1.

1470
01:17:21,875 --> 01:17:23,417
#1.
And #2.

1471
01:17:23,500 --> 01:17:25,041
It's foolproof.

1472
01:17:25,125 --> 01:17:26,417
When you get

1473
01:17:26,500 --> 01:17:29,041
over the drop area,
you press #1.

1474
01:17:29,125 --> 01:17:33,125
That releases the
"Banner of the 10,000
Illuminations"

1475
01:17:33,208 --> 01:17:34,709
from this hook.

1476
01:17:37,750 --> 01:17:39,083
Come here. Let me show you.

1477
01:17:39,166 --> 01:17:40,667
Come on.

1478
01:17:40,750 --> 01:17:41,917
From this hook right back here.

1479
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:43,083
You all see it?

1480
01:17:43,166 --> 01:17:44,542
Hook.

1481
01:17:45,208 --> 01:17:46,291
I see it.

1482
01:17:46,375 --> 01:17:48,417
Next, you look behind you

1483
01:17:48,500 --> 01:17:50,834
to make sure the banner
has been released.

1484
01:17:50,917 --> 01:17:52,166
Why?

1485
01:17:52,250 --> 01:17:53,083
I'll tell you why.

1486
01:17:53,709 --> 01:17:56,542
Because if it is not
released, you won't
ever touch #2.

1487
01:17:57,041 --> 01:17:58,208
Why?

1488
01:17:58,291 --> 01:17:59,417
I'll tell you why.

1489
01:17:59,500 --> 01:18:01,333
Because that will ignite
that son of a gun

1490
01:18:01,417 --> 01:18:02,625
too close to your airplane.

1491
01:18:02,709 --> 01:18:05,250
So, we're going to drop
a bomb on our audience.

1492
01:18:05,458 --> 01:18:06,000
Safer than

1493
01:18:06,333 --> 01:18:07,875
dropping a payload of feathers.

1494
01:18:08,959 --> 01:18:10,792
Provided you're up
at least 1,300 feet.

1495
01:18:10,875 --> 01:18:11,917
Now, I've already arranged

1496
01:18:12,166 --> 01:18:13,875
for the fire truck
to be on hand, just in case.

1497
01:18:13,959 --> 01:18:15,709
You won't need
no fire truck

1498
01:18:15,792 --> 01:18:18,000
as long as you stay
above 1,300 feet.

1499
01:18:18,083 --> 01:18:19,166
Yeah, right.

1500
01:18:19,250 --> 01:18:20,500
Guarantee you one thing.

1501
01:18:20,709 --> 01:18:22,917
Everybody looking up will swear
the sky is raining fire.

1502
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:24,625
HUBERT:
Well, that's what
we want, right?

1503
01:18:24,709 --> 01:18:26,667
Something they'll remember
all winter long.

1504
01:18:26,750 --> 01:18:28,834
That way they'll come back
when we reopen next spring.

1505
01:18:28,917 --> 01:18:29,750
Oh, they'll remember.

1506
01:18:29,834 --> 01:18:30,792
Yeah, okay, thank you.

1507
01:18:31,542 --> 01:18:32,375
You got it?

1508
01:18:32,458 --> 01:18:32,917
Oh, yeah.

1509
01:18:33,166 --> 01:18:34,041
HUBERT:
All right.

1510
01:18:34,125 --> 01:18:35,250
Sure you got that?

1511
01:18:35,333 --> 01:18:37,208
You want to have fun?

1512
01:18:37,291 --> 01:18:38,709
Drop that payload
right on top

1513
01:18:38,792 --> 01:18:40,959
of that undertaker fellow
you don't like.

1514
01:18:41,041 --> 01:18:43,000
He'll think the angels
in all their glory

1515
01:18:43,083 --> 01:18:45,583
have come down from heaven
to fetch him on high!

1516
01:18:45,667 --> 01:18:48,083
HUBERT:
That would
be something.

1517
01:18:48,166 --> 01:18:49,417
You've done
a wonderful job.

1518
01:18:49,500 --> 01:18:52,000
I really want
to thank you.

1519
01:18:54,291 --> 01:18:55,709
EDNA:
Every now and then

1520
01:18:55,792 --> 01:18:59,166

Hey, Mom,
Alice needs some quarters.

You're just the person
I was looking for.

1539
01:20:33,250 --> 01:20:36,083
Abraham, hold on.
I want to talk to you.

1540
01:20:36,166 --> 01:20:37,375
She needs them right away.

1541
01:20:37,458 --> 01:20:39,000
Yesterday, in fact.

1542
01:20:41,291 --> 01:20:42,417
Hey, Mom?

1543
01:20:44,291 --> 01:20:45,959
Is everything okay?

1544
01:20:46,041 --> 01:20:47,125
Yes, Abraham.

1545
01:20:47,208 --> 01:20:48,208
Don't worry so.

1546
01:20:48,291 --> 01:20:49,375
Everything's fine.

01:21:28,750 --> 01:21:29,458
There appears

1554
01:21:29,667 --> 01:21:30,709
to be an epic lack of discipline

1555
01:21:30,792 --> 01:21:33,000
in these environs tonight,
Jacob!

1556
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:38,208
So, what are you going to do
in the off-season, Alice?

1557
01:21:38,417 --> 01:21:41,125
Well, it's
a sad story, Jacob

1558
01:21:41,208 --> 01:21:42,250
but Polly and I
are going

1559
01:21:42,333 --> 01:21:44,166
to have to join
the hoochy-koochy show

1560
01:21:44,250 --> 01:21:47,041
until the Flamingo
opens up again
in the spring.

1561
01:21:47,125 --> 01:21:49,000
Who'd pay to see you,
Alice?

1562
01:21:49,083 --> 01:21:51,291
Hey, I've got news
for you, Missy.

1563
01:21:51,375 --> 01:21:52,417
Five years from now

1564
01:21:52,500 --> 01:21:54,000
after you have made
the transition

1565
01:21:54,083 --> 01:21:55,250
to size 18 maternity dresses

1566
01:21:55,333 --> 01:21:57,333
they'll still be
chasing after me

1567
01:21:57,417 --> 01:21:58,709
Miss Polly-Wolly!

1568
01:21:58,792 --> 01:22:00,166
( laughter )

1569
01:22:00,250 --> 01:22:01,291
So where's Mom?

1570
01:22:01,375 --> 01:22:02,709
Isn't she going to help
with the rush?

1571
01:22:02,792 --> 01:22:05,000
Nope, she decided to go up
with the Judge.

1572
01:22:05,083 --> 01:22:07,208
She did?

1573
01:22:07,291 --> 01:22:08,250
Why?

1574
01:22:08,458 --> 01:22:10,375
Um, there was some
sort of problem

1575
01:22:10,458 --> 01:22:12,834
with the Banner of the
10,000 Illuminations.

1576
01:22:12,917 --> 01:22:14,083
The Judge fixed it.

1577
01:22:14,166 --> 01:22:15,834
Fixed it?

1578
01:22:15,917 --> 01:22:17,792
Actually, I think
your mother wanted
to make sure

1579
01:22:17,875 --> 01:22:20,709
there was no repeat
of the last fireworks
fiasco.

1580
01:22:21,792 --> 01:22:24,041
She wanted to make sure
that old fool

1581
01:22:24,125 --> 01:22:25,959
dropped his payload
over the ocean

1582
01:22:26,041 --> 01:22:28,917
not the funeral home.

1583
01:22:29,208 --> 01:22:30,208
Jacob?

1584
01:22:30,291 --> 01:22:32,375
Jacob?

1585
01:22:32,458 --> 01:22:34,583
♪ Time has come today

1586
01:22:37,291 --> 01:22:39,667
♪ Time has come today

1587
01:22:42,458 --> 01:22:45,875
...because we have for you
a celestial conflagration

1588
01:22:45,959 --> 01:22:49,500
the likes of which we have
never witnessed anywhere.

1589
01:22:49,583 --> 01:22:51,875
Hey, Abraham,
ready for the fireworks?

1590
01:22:51,959 --> 01:22:55,375
Now, I want y'all to do
a little favor for me now.

1591
01:22:55,458 --> 01:22:57,208
I want y'all reaching up toward

1592
01:22:57,291 --> 01:23:00,041
the celestial lights.

1593
01:23:00,125 --> 01:23:01,500
Yeah, that's right!

1594
01:23:01,667 --> 01:23:03,458
Because what we have for you
tonight on this Labor Day

1595
01:23:03,542 --> 01:23:09,625
is the Banner of 10,000
Illumination Lights!

1596
01:23:09,709 --> 01:23:12,542
Yeah!

1597
01:23:12,625 --> 01:23:14,083
( amplified heartbeat )

1598
01:23:14,166 --> 01:23:15,458
Now, what's that?

1599
01:23:15,542 --> 01:23:18,000
Do you hear that?

1600
01:23:18,083 --> 01:23:20,458
I hear something coming...

1601
01:23:22,166 --> 01:23:25,750
( labored breathing )

1602
01:23:32,417 --> 01:23:34,667
( crowd clamoring )

1603
01:23:42,291 --> 01:23:43,834
There she is.

1604
01:23:45,709 --> 01:23:48,709
EDNA:
How beautiful it all is.

1605
01:23:50,083 --> 01:23:52,959
How incredibly beautiful.

1606
01:23:54,583 --> 01:23:56,792
HUBERT:
I hear something coming

1607
01:23:56,875 --> 01:23:59,542
so look to the firmament now,
ladies and gentlemen

1608
01:23:59,625 --> 01:24:03,583
because I give you...
the universe!

1609
01:24:03,667 --> 01:24:05,291
( cheering and applause )

1610
01:24:05,375 --> 01:24:06,500
( hammer clicks )

1611
01:24:36,083 --> 01:24:37,959
No!

1612
01:24:38,041 --> 01:24:40,083
No!

1613
01:24:43,041 --> 01:24:44,458
Shh...

1614
01:24:55,625 --> 01:24:57,583
( sobbing )

1615
01:25:02,125 --> 01:25:03,458
( crowd sobbing )

1616
01:25:22,417 --> 01:25:24,583
( thunder rumbling )

1617
01:26:12,792 --> 01:26:14,917
I wonder if
I might come in.

1618
01:26:35,500 --> 01:26:37,709
( sniffling )

1619
01:26:42,792 --> 01:26:46,709
The land for the
cemetery is yours

1620
01:26:46,792 --> 01:26:48,834
if you still want it

1621
01:26:48,917 --> 01:26:52,083
and if you would allow me
to select her plot.

1622
01:26:52,166 --> 01:26:53,417
Yes.

1623
01:27:00,291 --> 01:27:02,417
Would you care to...?

1624
01:27:02,500 --> 01:27:04,041
Yes. Yes, thank you.

1625
01:27:04,125 --> 01:27:05,291
That would...

1626
01:27:06,417 --> 01:27:08,083
Thank you.

1627
01:28:01,166 --> 01:28:04,875
I don't know how to thank you,
Mr. Knight.

1628
01:28:04,959 --> 01:28:08,625
You have
a very, very great skill.

1629
01:28:10,417 --> 01:28:12,750
No, it is my sons
you wish to thank.

1630
01:28:21,041 --> 01:28:22,458
I could not.

1631
01:29:12,792 --> 01:29:15,667
Going to the funeral?

1632
01:29:22,625 --> 01:29:24,375
Do you want
to tell me why you knew

1633
01:29:24,458 --> 01:29:26,291
what was going to happen
before it did?

1634
01:29:26,375 --> 01:29:29,125
No.

1635
01:29:34,625 --> 01:29:37,125
Why don't you tell me anyway?

1636
01:29:39,709 --> 01:29:42,083
Want to have a little fun?

1637
01:29:42,166 --> 01:29:43,041
Drop that payload

1638
01:29:43,333 --> 01:29:44,333
Right on top of that
undertaker fella

1639
01:29:44,417 --> 01:29:45,000
you don't like.

1640
01:29:45,583 --> 01:29:46,959
He'll think the angels
in all their glory

1641
01:29:47,041 --> 01:29:49,417
have come down from heaven
to fetch him on high!

1642
01:29:49,500 --> 01:29:50,500
That would be
something.

1643
01:29:50,583 --> 01:29:51,875
Think about it.

1644
01:29:51,959 --> 01:29:54,333
EDNA:
Every now and then
Hubert Lee needs

1645
01:29:54,417 --> 01:29:56,166
to be saved from himself.

1646
01:29:57,750 --> 01:29:59,583
( heartbeat )

1647
01:30:19,041 --> 01:30:21,583
ABRAHAM:
When the judge fixed the wires

1648
01:30:21,667 --> 01:30:25,750
he must have spliced them
the wrong way.

1649
01:30:31,250 --> 01:30:35,750
When he pushed the button
to release the banner...

1650
01:30:41,834 --> 01:30:44,583
I killed her, Alice.

1651
01:30:44,667 --> 01:30:47,083
Oh, come here, sweetheart.

1652
01:30:52,500 --> 01:30:55,083
It was an accident, Jacob.

1653
01:31:00,041 --> 01:31:02,041
Now, you listen
to me, okay?

1654
01:31:02,125 --> 01:31:04,875
Listen.

1655
01:31:04,959 --> 01:31:09,750
I know that
it doesn't feel like it now

1656
01:31:09,834 --> 01:31:13,291
but one day you are going
to forgive yourself, Jacob.

1657
01:31:13,375 --> 01:31:17,041
And it won't be because you feel
like you deserve it.

1658
01:31:17,125 --> 01:31:19,041
It'll be because you realize

1659
01:31:19,125 --> 01:31:21,959
that your mother has
already forgiven you.

1660
01:31:22,041 --> 01:31:26,792
She forgave you in advance.

1661
01:31:29,458 --> 01:31:34,083
And there's something else
you've been wrong about, Jacob.

1662
01:31:34,166 --> 01:31:35,709
You've always thought
of yourself

1663
01:31:35,792 --> 01:31:36,750
as your father's son

1664
01:31:36,834 --> 01:31:40,792
but you are her son, too.

1665
01:31:43,667 --> 01:31:48,500
You have her faith, Jacob.

1666
01:31:48,583 --> 01:31:51,041
God forgives you.

1667
01:31:53,750 --> 01:31:55,500
Your mother forgives you...

1668
01:31:58,291 --> 01:32:00,917
and one day
you will forgive yourself.

1669
01:32:17,166 --> 01:32:18,917
Come on.

1670
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:20,083
Your father needs you.

1671
01:32:22,667 --> 01:32:25,291
ABRAHAM:
Alice was right, of course.

1672
01:32:25,375 --> 01:32:26,458
With my mother gone

1673
01:32:26,750 --> 01:32:30,000
my father did need me
far more than I knew.

1674
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:54,959
This will be a fine cemetery,
won't it, Abraham?

1675
01:33:56,041 --> 01:33:58,542
And this, right here

1676
01:33:58,625 --> 01:34:03,000
will be the finest plot.

1677
01:34:18,125 --> 01:34:22,250
But you do see
the problem, though.

1678
01:34:22,333 --> 01:34:25,625
I won't put her
in the dark, Abraham.

1679
01:34:25,709 --> 01:34:27,166
I can't.

1680
01:34:29,917 --> 01:34:32,959
If ever there was a woman
who deserved to see the sun

1681
01:34:33,041 --> 01:34:35,166
that woman was your mother.

1682
01:34:53,375 --> 01:34:57,458
ABRAHAM:
"Biology," my father always
told me when I was little

1683
01:34:57,542 --> 01:35:00,500
"has got nothing to do
with parenthood."

1684
01:35:00,583 --> 01:35:02,125
He was right.

1685
01:35:02,208 --> 01:35:05,208
No mother was ever more real
than mine.

1686
01:35:05,291 --> 01:35:09,375
I was kissed every night
and told that I was loved.

1687
01:35:09,458 --> 01:35:12,333
The night Edna Lee
fell from the sky

1688
01:35:12,417 --> 01:35:15,709
was the night Hubert T. Lee,
my real father

1689
01:35:15,792 --> 01:35:20,500
saw that Death had crossed
the highway, not just to
visit.

1690
01:35:20,583 --> 01:35:22,834
And in time,
hope rose from the ashes

1691
01:35:22,917 --> 01:35:25,583
of the Flamingo Drive-in
Theater...

1692
01:35:25,667 --> 01:35:28,667
for my father, for my sister

1693
01:35:28,750 --> 01:35:30,959
and yes, even for me

1694
01:35:31,041 --> 01:35:34,709
Abraham Jacob Lee.
