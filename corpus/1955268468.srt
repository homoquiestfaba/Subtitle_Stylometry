It's Hawaii, Dad.

186
00:13:57,135 --> 00:13:58,637
That's Where Kids Go.

187
00:13:58,637 --> 00:14:01,373
 They Go All The Time.

188
00:14:01,373 --> 00:14:02,274
Not Alone.

189
00:14:02,274 --> 00:14:03,441
I Won't Be Alone.

190
00:14:03,441 --> 00:14:05,844
Gia's Going
With Her Friends.

191
00:14:05,844 --> 00:14:06,778
We'll All Be Together.

192
00:14:06,778 --> 00:14:08,413
We Don't Even
Know These Kids.

193
00:14:08,413 --> 00:14:12,251
I'll Be Careful, Dad.
I Promise.

194
00:14:13,251 --> 00:14:14,052
No. I'm Sorry.

195
00:14:14,052 --> 00:14:17,155
 Honey, It's Just
 Not A Good Idea.

196
00:14:17,155 --> 00:14:18,723
That Is So Unfair.

197
00:14:18,723 --> 00:14:22,560
You're Treating Me
Like I'm A Baby. I'm 13.

198
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:23,528
She Said She'd
Be Careful, Ben.

199
00:14:23,528 --> 00:14:26,765
 She Knows What She's
 Capable Of. Trust Her.

200
00:14:26,765 --> 00:14:28,533
Does She Know
About Undertows?

201
00:14:28,533 --> 00:14:29,601
 About Riptides?

202
00:14:29,601 --> 00:14:30,536
Does She Know
How These Currents

203
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:32,170
Can Just Come
Whipping Up
Out Of Nowhere?

204
00:14:32,170 --> 00:14:36,841
Ok. Ok, Just
Take It Easy.

205
00:14:36,841 --> 00:14:38,843
What If I Don't Even
Go In The Water?

206
00:14:38,843 --> 00:14:42,147
 What If I Just
 Take Pictures?

207
00:14:42,147 --> 00:14:44,382
Would That Be Ok?

208
00:14:44,382 --> 00:14:45,685
Dad?

209
00:14:46,685 --> 00:14:48,156
Please?

210
00:14:51,156 --> 00:14:52,796
Ben?

211
00:14:57,796 --> 00:14:59,631
Elizabeth: Have Fun.

212
00:14:59,631 --> 00:15:01,900
Bye.

213
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:03,401
Hello There.

214
00:15:03,401 --> 00:15:04,337
Hi.

215
00:15:05,337 --> 00:15:06,071
Sydney...

216
00:15:06,071 --> 00:15:07,806
You Have The Cell
Phone, Right?

217
00:15:07,806 --> 00:15:08,940
If You Need Us?

218
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:09,841
Got It.

219
00:15:09,841 --> 00:15:11,476
You Know The Number?

220
00:15:11,476 --> 00:15:13,745
Dad.

221
00:15:13,745 --> 00:15:15,847
What If She's Not
There, This Girl?

222
00:15:15,847 --> 00:15:17,816
She'll Be There.

223
00:15:17,816 --> 00:15:19,417
But If She's Not?

224
00:15:19,417 --> 00:15:21,353
I'll Come Back.

225
00:15:21,353 --> 00:15:23,890
Right Back.

226
00:15:25,890 --> 00:15:27,890
Hello There.

227
00:15:25,890 --> 00:15:27,425
Aloha.

228
00:15:27,425 --> 00:15:28,927
This Is Ben
And Elizabeth.

229
00:15:28,927 --> 00:15:30,927
Hi.

230
00:15:28,927 --> 00:15:30,395
Hi, Ben.

231
00:15:30,395 --> 00:15:31,629
Hi, Nice To See You.

232
00:15:31,629 --> 00:15:32,664
Ok.

233

Hey!

237
00:16:34,793 --> 00:16:37,695
Who's The Grom?

238
00:16:37,695 --> 00:16:38,429
You Know Her?

239
00:16:38,429 --> 00:16:40,765
She's The One
I Told You About.

240
00:16:40,765 --> 00:16:42,336
Oh.

241
00:16:45,336 --> 00:16:46,337
Hey, You Made It.

242
00:16:46,337 --> 00:16:47,405
Yeah, I Made It.

243
00:16:47,405 --> 00:16:48,506
It's So Good Out There.

I Mean, When You're
Not Wearing That.

321
00:20:27,959 --> 00:20:29,560
Everyone Surfs
Around Here,

322
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:31,963

A Major Dork.

00:20:31,963 --> 00:20:34,799
You're
A Longboarder,
Ey?

324
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:35,967
Sort Of.

325
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:36,000

326
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,270
Uh, But I Like
Those, Too.

327
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:40,238
Exactly.

328
00:20:40,238 --> 00:20:42,740
The Thing About
The Longboards,
Riding Them?

329
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:45,943
It's Like Cruising
On The Waves,

330
00:20:45,943 --> 00:20:47,812
Slow And Fluid.

331
00:20:47,812 --> 00:20:49,213
Keeps You Connected.

332
00:20:49,213 --> 00:20:50,682
But A Shortboard,

333
00:20:50,682 --> 00:20:52,717
It's Like Daring You
To Meet The Edge,

334
00:20:52,717 --> 00:20:54,786
Slice Through
The Other Side.

335
00:20:54,786 --> 00:20:57,891
You Make
Your Own Rules.

336
00:20:59,891 --> 00:21:00,792
What?

337
00:21:00,792 --> 00:21:02,760
You're A Poet.

338
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:04,696

339
00:21:04,696 --> 00:21:07,832

It's Nice.

00:21:07,832 --> 00:21:09,167
It Must Be Hard,
I Mean,

341
00:21:09,167 --> 00:21:12,069
Learning How To Ride
The Short Ones.

342
00:21:12,069 --> 00:21:13,671
Must Take Forever, Huh?

343
00:21:13,671 --> 00:21:17,275
You've Never Been
Out There Before,
Have You?

344
00:21:17,275 --> 00:21:20,078
What?! Why Would You
Say That?

345
00:21:20,078 --> 00:21:22,580
Because You Haven't,
Right?

346
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:26,084
Well, You Mean,
Technically?

347
00:21:26,084 --> 00:21:28,088
Out There Surfing?

348
00:21:31,088 --> 00:21:32,290
No.

349
00:21:32,290 --> 00:21:33,258
Never Even Tried?

350
00:21:33,258 --> 00:21:36,294
There's Not
A Lot Of Surf
In Lake Michigan.

351
00:21:36,294 --> 00:21:39,630
I Mean, Besides,
I Know What My Parents
Would Say--

352
00:21:39,630 --> 00:21:42,000
Too Risky, Too Dangerous,
Too Everything.

353
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,604
That Is So Crazy.

354
00:21:46,604 --> 00:21:47,972
Keep Your Center
Of Balance.

355
00:21:47,972 --> 00:21:49,107
Now Paddle.

356
00:21:49,107 --> 00:21:51,209
Harder. Harder.

357
00:21:51,209 --> 00:21:52,343
Ok, Now Stand Up.

358
00:21:52,343 --> 00:21:54,113
Come On, Stand Up!

359
00:21:55,113 --> 00:21:55,113
Yeah!

360
00:21:55,113 --> 00:21:55,113
Yeah!

361
00:21:55,781 --> 00:21:58,149
You've Got It,
You're Ready.

362
00:21:58,149 --> 00:21:59,817
For What?

363
00:21:59,817 --> 00:22:02,326
Well, What'd You Think?

364
00:22:08,326 --> 00:22:10,060
Gia?

365
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:11,195
What?

366
00:22:11,195 --> 00:22:12,797
You Scared?

367
00:22:12,797 --> 00:22:14,133
No.

368
00:22:15,133 --> 00:22:15,133
Yeah.

369
00:22:15,967 --> 00:22:18,236
Hey, Being Scared,

00:41:23,813 --> 00:41:26,816
I Mean, If They Come
While I'm Here.

733
00:41:26,816 --> 00:41:27,550
Could You?

734
00:41:27,550 --> 00:41:29,519
It's Like Being
Offered A Gift,

735
00:41:29,519 --> 00:41:30,187
Seeing The Whales.

736
00:41:30,187 --> 00:41:32,225
You Have To Be
Ready For It.

737
00:41:35,225 --> 00:41:38,161
Sydney: Hello?
Anybody Home?

738
00:41:38,161 --> 00:41:41,865
Probably Called Out
The National Guard By Now.

739
00:41:41,865 --> 00:41:43,500
No. They Can't Be
That Worried.

740
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:46,102
Elizabeth: Sydney?
Is That You?

741
00:41:46,102 --> 00:41:47,337
Or Maybe They Can.

742
00:41:47,337 --> 00:41:49,072
Should I Tell Them?

743
00:41:49,072 --> 00:41:49,072
It's Up To You.

744
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:53,544
Oh, We've Been
So Worried.

745
00:41:54,544 --> 00:41:56,479
Your Father's
Out There Right Now

746
00:41:56,479 --> 00:41:59,786
Looking Everywhere
For You.

747
00:42:02,786 --> 00:42:03,987
What Happened?

748
00:42:03,987 --> 00:42:05,388
Are You All Right?

749
00:42:05,388 --> 00:42:07,357
Yeah. It's Nothing,
Just A Little Cut.

750
00:42:07,357 --> 00:42:08,258
I'm Fine.

751
00:42:08,258 --> 00:42:12,094
This Is Gia's Mom--
Malia.

752
00:42:12,094 --> 00:42:14,365
She Took Care Of Me.

753
00:42:15,365 --> 00:42:17,233
Thank You So Much.

754
00:42:17,233 --> 00:42:19,970
Really.

755
00:42:19,970 --> 00:42:21,471
You Didn't Get
Stitches, Did You?

756
00:42:21,471 --> 00:42:22,939
What'd You
Hit It On?

757
00:42:22,939 --> 00:42:24,574
It's No Big Deal,
Honest.

758
00:42:24,574 --> 00:42:27,211
She's Fine.

[Car Door]

760
00:42:29,112 --> 00:42:31,215
Ben? She's Here.

761
00:42:32,215 --> 00:42:34,253
[Footsteps]

762
00:42:37,253 --> 00:42:38,989
You're Safe.
Thank Heaven.

763
00:42:38,989 --> 00:42:40,890
Where Have You Been?

764
00:42:40,890 --> 00:42:42,027
What Happened?

765
00:42:44,027 --> 00:42:45,395
I...

766
00:42:45,395 --> 00:42:46,463
I, Uh...

767
00:42:46,463 --> 00:42:47,530
Well...

768
00:42:47,530 --> 00:42:50,567
I Know I Wasn't
Supposed To, But...

769
00:42:50,567 --> 00:42:52,402
Being A Part Of It...

770
00:42:52,402 --> 00:42:55,171
Not Being Stuck
On The Outside,

771
00:42:55,171 --> 00:42:58,475
But Really Being
A Part Of Something,

772
00:42:58,475 --> 00:43:00,443
I Always Wanted That.

773
00:43:00,443 --> 00:43:01,978
What Are You
Talking About, Baby?

774
00:43:01,978 --> 00:43:04,616
You're Not
Making Sense.

775
00:43:06,616 --> 00:43:09,854
Well...

776
00:43:10,854 --> 00:43:14,391
I Went Surfing
With The Other Kids.

777
00:43:14,391 --> 00:43:16,127
What?!

778
00:43:17,127 --> 00:43:17,027
I'm Sorry, But...

779
00:43:18,027 --> 00:43:20,997
I Know You Didn't
Want Me To Go Out There,

780
00:43:20,997 --> 00:43:24,367
But I Had To Try--
To See If I Could Do It.

781
00:43:24,367 --> 00:43:25,969
And Then I Fell, But...

782
00:43:25,969 --> 00:43:27,504
I Didn't Get Hurt,
Not Seriously.

783
00:43:27,504 --> 00:43:30,874
So There's Nothing
To Worry About,
Right, Dad?

784
00:43:30,874 --> 00:43:32,575
Go To Your Room,
Sydney.

785
00:43:32,575 --> 00:43:33,476
But, Dad--

786
00:43:33,476 --> 00:43:35,245
To Your Room. Now.

787
00:43:35,245 --> 00:43:37,245
That's Not Fair.
I Just--

788
00:43:35,245 --> 00:43:37,252
Sydney!

789
00:43:42,252 --> 00:43:43,486
Ben: How Could You Do This?

790
00:43:43,486 --> 00:43:45,388
Malia: She Wanted It.
You Heard Her.

791
00:43:45,388 --> 00:43:47,290
This Has Nothing
To Do With Me.

792
00:43:47,290 --> 00:43:48,191
I'm Supposed
To Believe That,

793
00:43:48,191 --> 00:43:50,560
That You Weren't Out There
Cheering Her On,

794
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:52,228
Filling Her Head
Full Of Stories?

795
00:43:52,228 --> 00:43:53,463
Well, You Certainly
Haven't Been.

796
00:43:53,463 --> 00:43:55,331
Everything Is Completely
Foreign To Her.

797
00:43:55,331 --> 00:43:56,966
You've Never Even
Mentioned My Name.

798
00:43:56,966 --> 00:43:58,601
Why? Why Haven't You
Told Her, Ben?

799
00:43:58,601 --> 00:44:00,670
I Am Not Gonna
Let Her Get Hurt.

800
00:44:00,670 --> 00:44:02,472
That Is The Bottom Line.

801
00:44:02,472 --> 00:44:03,540
She Needs To Know
Who She Is

802
00:44:03,540 --> 00:44:05,909
And Where
She Comes From.

803
00:44:05,909 --> 00:44:06,577
She Does.

804
00:44:06,577 --> 00:44:07,011
No. You've
Kept Her From It.

805
00:44:08,011 --> 00:44:09,512
You Whisked Her Away,
And You've Cut Her Off.

806
00:44:09,512 --> 00:44:11,548
I Have Tried To Do
What's Best For Her.

807
00:44:11,548 --> 00:44:13,249
That Is All
I Care About.

808
00:44:13,249 --> 00:44:16,219
I've Never Seen Him
Like This.

809
00:44:16,219 --> 00:44:18,455
He's So...

810
00:44:18,455 --> 00:44:19,656
I Know.

811
00:44:19,656 --> 00:44:22,128
It'll Be Ok.

812
00:44:25,128 --> 00:44:28,698
She Oughta Be Grabbing
Life With Both Hands,

813
00:44:28,698 --> 00:44:30,467
But You've Got Her
So Scared, So...

814
00:44:30,467 --> 00:44:32,335
Don't Make It Sound
So Simple.

815
00:44:32,335 --> 00:44:33,603
Use What's Here, Ben.

816
00:44:33,603 --> 00:44:35,505
The Ocean
Is A Great Healer.

817
00:44:35,505 --> 00:44:36,473
And A Great Destroyer.

818
00:44:36,473 --> 00:44:39,976
No. If You'd Just Seen Her
Out There With Gia.

819
00:44:39,976 --> 00:44:42,145
She Is A Natural,
Just Like Her--

820
00:44:42,145 --> 00:44:43,680
Leave Her Alone,
Malia.

821
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:45,047
Back Off.

822
00:44:45,047 --> 00:44:47,617
You Can't Protect Her
Forever.

823
00:44:47,617 --> 00:44:49,486
I Can Try.

824
00:44:49,486 --> 00:44:52,555
Stop Running 
From It, Ben.

825
00:44:52,555 --> 00:44:53,456
Pry It Open,

826
00:44:53,456 --> 00:44:55,692
This Lid You've Got
Clamped Down So Hard.

827
00:44:55,692 --> 00:44:56,693
Let It Go.

828
00:44:56,693 --> 00:44:59,168
Let Things Heal.

830
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:12,577
[Sigh]

831
00:45:14,577 --> 00:45:17,580
Elizabeth: She's Not
Entirely Wrong.

832
00:45:17,580 --> 00:45:20,717
I Didn't Even Know
You Were There.

833
00:45:20,717 --> 00:45:23,620
That's Part
Of The Problem.

834
00:45:23,620 --> 00:45:26,356
Things Will Be Fine
Once We're Back Home,

835
00:45:26,356 --> 00:45:28,056
Away From This Place.

836
00:45:28,056 --> 00:45:29,359
Everything Will Be
Normal Again.

837
00:45:29,359 --> 00:45:30,427
What Is That
Supposed To Mean,

838
00:45:30,427 --> 00:45:33,563
That We'll Just
Keep Pretending
It Never Happened?

839
00:45:33,563 --> 00:45:34,598
No, Of Course Not.

840
00:45:34,598 --> 00:45:38,301
Ben, If You'd
Fallen In Love
With Another Woman,

841
00:45:38,301 --> 00:45:40,303
Someone
Flesh And Blood,

842
00:45:40,303 --> 00:45:41,304
I'd Know What To Do.

843
00:45:41,304 --> 00:45:44,440
And I Would
Fight Like Crazy
To Hang On To Us,

844
00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:47,310
To What We Have
Together.

845
00:45:47,310 --> 00:45:49,078
But This?

846
00:45:49,078 --> 00:45:49,078
Liz...

847
00:45:49,712 --> 00:45:51,247
What Am I
Supposed To Do?

848
00:45:51,247 --> 00:45:53,116
Tell Me, Ben.

849
00:45:53,116 --> 00:45:57,603
How Am I Supposed
To Fight A Ghost?

850
00:46:13,603 --> 00:46:15,072

Hey.

Your Stepmom Said
You Were Out Here.

854
00:46:26,716 --> 00:46:28,151
You Ok?

855
00:46:28,151 --> 00:46:29,319
Yeah.

856
00:46:29,319 --> 00:46:30,453
You Sure?

857
00:46:30,453 --> 00:46:32,689
A Little Bummed.

858
00:46:32,689 --> 00:46:34,591
My Dad Was So Mad.

859
00:46:34,591 --> 00:46:35,592
I Heard.

Must Be All About
Your Mom's Accident, Huh?

864
00:46:43,065 --> 00:46:45,802
What Do You
Know About It?

865
00:46:45,802 --> 00:46:48,471
Did Malia Tell You?

866
00:46:48,471 --> 00:46:49,572
Well, Not Much.

867
00:46:49,572 --> 00:46:50,473

An Accident Out There.

That's Just What
I've Always Heard.

871
00:46:56,279 --> 00:46:58,548
Of Course, I Could
Have It All Wrong.

872
00:46:58,548 --> 00:47:00,350
It Wouldn't Be
The First Time.

00:47:03,353 --> 00:47:05,488
What Does Your Dad Say?

875
00:47:05,488 --> 00:47:06,322
Nothing.

876
00:47:06,322 --> 00:47:07,290
That's The Problem.

877
00:47:07,290 --> 00:47:11,227
How Come You Never
Asked Him?

878
00:47:11,227 --> 00:47:13,463

Tell Me.

883

If--

01:00:53,215 --> 01:00:56,218
Didn't Really Want
To Know What Happened.

1094
01:00:56,218 --> 01:00:57,519
He Could Barely
Even Listen.

1095
01:00:57,519 --> 01:00:59,388
He Just Wanted
To Get Away,

1096
01:00:59,388 --> 01:01:01,490
And Get You Out Of Here.

1097
01:01:01,490 --> 01:01:02,324
It's Like...

1098
01:01:02,324 --> 01:01:04,493
He Blamed The Islands
For Losing Her.

1099
01:01:04,493 --> 01:01:09,098
Your Mom Fought So Hard
In Those Waves

1100
01:01:09,098 --> 01:01:12,001
To Get Back To You,
Sydney. That's Why.

1101
01:01:14,001 --> 01:01:17,106
She's Supposed To Be Here
While I'm Growing Up.

1102
01:01:17,106 --> 01:01:19,508
I Hate Her For Not
Thinking About That.

1103
01:01:19,508 --> 01:01:23,145
Oh, You Have
To Forgive Her, Sydney,

1104
01:01:23,145 --> 01:01:25,514
Both You And Your Dad.

1105
01:01:25,514 --> 01:01:26,348
Why?

1106
01:01:26,348 --> 01:01:29,150
For Your Own Sake.

1107
01:02:01,150 --> 01:02:03,289
Sydney?

1108
01:02:07,289 --> 01:02:10,225
I Left You A Note
So You Wouldn't Worry.

1109
01:02:10,225 --> 01:02:12,395
I Found It.

1110
01:02:13,395 --> 01:02:16,432
Malia Brought Me Back.

1111
01:02:17,432 --> 01:02:19,001
I Saw.

1112
01:02:20,001 --> 01:02:21,537
You Should Have
Told Me About It.

1113
01:02:21,537 --> 01:02:25,710
It Shouldn't Have Been
Some Deep, Dark Secret.

1117
01:02:56,471 --> 01:02:58,574
I Kept Thinking...

1118
01:02:58,574 --> 01:03:01,677
That I Should Have Been
There When It Happened.

1119
01:03:01,677 --> 01:03:05,047
That I Should Have
Saved Her...

1120
01:03:05,047 --> 01:03:07,316
Stopped Her....
Something.

1121
01:03:07,316 --> 01:03:09,251
It Was An Accident.

1122
01:03:09,251 --> 01:03:11,690
Nobody's Fault.

1123
01:03:14,690 --> 01:03:16,725
When I Lost Her,

1124
01:03:16,725 --> 01:03:20,631
I Didn't Think I'd
Ever Love Anyone Again.

1125
01:03:22,631 --> 01:03:23,665
And Then...

1126
01:03:23,665 --> 01:03:26,404
I Found You.

1127
01:03:29,404 --> 01:03:31,106
It Didn't Seem Fair

1128
01:03:31,106 --> 01:03:33,775
That I Should Be
So Happy,

1129
01:03:33,775 --> 01:03:34,843
And She's--

1130
01:03:34,843 --> 01:03:35,544
Oh, Ben.

1131
01:03:35,544 --> 01:03:38,513
She Would Want You
To Be Happy,

1132
01:03:38,513 --> 01:03:40,382
You And Sydney,

1133
01:03:40,382 --> 01:03:42,551

1134
01:03:42,551 --> 01:03:45,517
She Would Want That.

1135
01:04:15,517 --> 01:04:17,521
Want To Take A Walk?

1136
01:04:19,521 --> 01:04:21,228
Sure.

1137
01:04:26,228 --> 01:04:28,797
When People Ask Me
What She Was Like,

1138
01:04:28,797 --> 01:04:30,632
I Make Things Up.

Fantasy In My Head

To Know?

I Looked At Her,

1146
01:04:52,154 --> 01:04:53,455
It Took My Breath Away.

01:04:53,455 --> 01:04:54,490
She Was So Beautiful

01:05:13,408 --> 01:05:16,812
I Wish I Could Have
Known Her.

I Thought
I Was Protecting You

01:05:27,823 --> 01:05:31,662
By Getting You
Away From Here.

1163
01:05:33,662 --> 01:05:35,297

What To Do With It,

01:05:45,440 --> 01:05:48,877

Belongs To You.

To Know What To Do...

Have To Cross Your
Fingers And Hope.

1175
01:06:02,557 --> 01:06:03,658
I'd Be Lying To You

If I Told You
We Didn't Need It,

1177
01:06:05,460 --> 01:06:06,895
That It Didn't Matter.

1178
01:06:06,895 --> 01:06:08,430
Of Course It Matters.

What's Important.

Wherever The Heck He Was.

1262
01:11:14,869 --> 01:11:16,104
He Promised.

1263
01:11:16,104 --> 01:11:19,240
And For Some Dumb Reason,
I Believed Him.

1264
01:11:19,240 --> 01:11:23,945
So, I Waited Around,
Like, The Whole Day.

1265
01:11:23,945 --> 01:11:25,014
But I Guess He Forgot.

1266
01:11:26,014 --> 01:11:26,015
It Was My Own Fault. 

1267
01:11:27,015 --> 01:11:29,951
I Mean, I Should
Have Known.

01:11:29,951 --> 01:11:32,554

01:11:47,936 --> 01:11:50,138
Even The Part
About The Whales?

1273
01:11:50,138 --> 01:11:51,239
Did You See?

1274
01:11:51,239 --> 01:11:54,776
The Lagoon
Will Be A Preserve.

1275
01:11:54,776 --> 01:11:56,711
They Made Them Promise.

1276
01:11:56,711 --> 01:11:59,247
At Least We're Trying
To Keep What's There,

1277
01:11:59,247 --> 01:12:00,181
What's Special.

1278
01:12:00,181 --> 01:12:01,649
It's A Resort, Sydney.

1279
01:12:01,649 --> 01:12:02,550
Everything Will Change.

1280
01:12:02,550 --> 01:12:04,619
You Think The Whales
Will Keep Coming Back

1281
01:12:04,619 --> 01:12:08,725
Once Their Lagoon's
Filled With Tourists?

1282
01:12:10,725 --> 01:12:12,227
When We First Met
At Makai,

1283
01:12:12,227 --> 01:12:14,829
Did You Plan It...

1284
01:12:14,829 --> 01:12:16,096
You And Malia?

1285
01:12:16,096 --> 01:12:17,032
I Mean, The Inheritance,

1286
01:12:18,032 --> 01:12:19,734
Is That Why You
Became My Friend?

1287
01:12:19,734 --> 01:12:21,970
What?! Where'd You
Get That?

1288
01:12:21,970 --> 01:12:24,241
The Truth, Gia.

1289
01:12:26,241 --> 01:12:29,277
Kind Of. I Mean,
We Thought That,
You Know,

1290
01:12:29,277 --> 01:12:30,612
If You Got To Know
Everybody,

1291
01:12:30,612 --> 01:12:32,180
If I Accidentally
Ran Into You

1292
01:12:32,180 --> 01:12:34,215
And Got
Things Started.

1293
01:12:34,215 --> 01:12:35,685
But It Changed.

1294
01:12:37,685 --> 01:12:40,321
Hey! Sydney,
Listen To Me.

1295
01:12:40,321 --> 01:12:42,390
Once We Got To Know
Each Other,

1296
01:12:42,390 --> 01:12:43,525
It Changed.

1297
01:12:43,525 --> 01:12:45,860
I Stopped Being
Your Friend Because
I Was Supposed To,

1298
01:12:45,860 --> 01:12:49,063
I Just Did It
Because It Was Fun.

1299
01:12:49,063 --> 01:12:49,063
Listen--

1300
01:12:49,764 --> 01:12:51,000
Why? So You Can
Lie Some More?

1301
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:52,001
It's The Truth.

1302
01:12:53,001 --> 01:12:53,001
Boy, You're Good.

1303
01:12:53,769 --> 01:12:55,837
Ever Consider
Going To Hollywood,

1304
01:12:55,837 --> 01:12:56,005
Making Use
Of That Talent?

1305
01:12:57,005 --> 01:12:58,339
This Isn't An Act.

1306
01:12:58,339 --> 01:12:59,707
God, I'm Not Trying
To Work You,

1307
01:12:59,707 --> 01:13:00,708
Why Would You Say That?

1308
01:13:00,708 --> 01:13:01,509
'Cause That's All I Hear.

1309
01:13:01,509 --> 01:13:03,311
Lies On Top Of Lies
On Top Of Lies.

1310
01:13:03,311 --> 01:13:05,213
You Weren't Exactly
Telling The Truth,
Either.

1311
01:13:05,213 --> 01:13:06,981
Pretending To Be
Some Big Surfer Chick.

1312
01:13:06,981 --> 01:13:08,817
I Never Said I Could Surf.

1313
01:13:08,817 --> 01:13:09,818
You Assumed.

1314
01:13:09,818 --> 01:13:10,019
Oh, I Get It.
My Lies Count,

1315
01:13:11,019 --> 01:13:11,019
But Yours Don't.

1316
01:13:11,886 --> 01:13:14,789
They All Knew,
Didn't They?

1317
01:13:14,789 --> 01:13:16,825
You Let Me Make
A Fool Of Myself

1318
01:13:16,825 --> 01:13:17,726
In Front Of Everyone.

1319
01:13:17,726 --> 01:13:19,661
You Didn't Need Any
Help Playing The Fool.

1320
01:13:19,661 --> 01:13:21,162
You Handled That
All On Your Own,

1321
01:13:21,162 --> 01:13:23,064
Like Some Stupid
Lovesick Puppy.

1322
01:13:23,064 --> 01:13:25,233
Kona?!
Was He In It, Too?

1323
01:13:25,233 --> 01:13:27,202
I Hate You!
I Hate All Of You!

1324
01:13:27,202 --> 01:13:28,336
And You Know What?

1325
01:13:28,336 --> 01:13:29,804
I Am Going To Sell Makai.

1326
01:13:29,804 --> 01:13:31,206
I'm Gonna Get Off
This Stupid Island,

1327
01:13:31,206 --> 01:13:33,208
And Forget
Any Of You Existed.

1328
01:13:33,208 --> 01:13:36,214
Fine! Go Back, Then.
Who Needs You!

1329
01:13:39,214 --> 01:13:40,885
Sydney!

1330
01:14:16,885 --> 01:14:18,023
James:
Everything's Ready.

1331
01:14:22,023 --> 01:14:23,291
Is That For Us?

1332
01:14:23,291 --> 01:14:25,927
Well, We Thought
A Little Toast

1333
01:14:25,927 --> 01:14:26,861
Might Be In Order.

1334
01:14:26,861 --> 01:14:28,963
It's Sparkling Cider...

1335
01:14:28,963 --> 01:14:32,402
In Honor Of Sydney.

1336
01:14:34,402 --> 01:14:35,737
Elizabeth:
Thank You.

1337
01:14:35,737 --> 01:14:37,174
Here You Go, Honey.

1338
01:14:40,174 --> 01:14:41,442
Ben: Bo?

1339
01:14:41,442 --> 01:14:43,814
Thank You.

1340
01:14:46,814 --> 01:14:48,088
Sydney.

1341
01:14:55,088 --> 01:14:57,091
James:
To A Hard-Fought Decision,

1342
01:14:57,091 --> 01:14:59,227
And A Bright Future.

1343
01:14:59,227 --> 01:15:01,268
Congratulations.

1344
01:15:07,268 --> 01:15:08,970
You All Right?

1345
01:15:08,970 --> 01:15:11,272
Yeah.

1346
01:15:11,272 --> 01:15:12,473
All That's Left,

1347
01:15:12,473 --> 01:15:16,389
Is To Cross The Ts
And Dot The Is.

1348
01:16:01,389 --> 01:16:02,024
Malia! Gia!

1349
01:16:03,024 --> 01:16:04,993
Are You In There?

1350
01:16:04,993 --> 01:16:06,294
Hello!

1351
01:16:06,294 --> 01:16:07,362
Sydney?

1352
01:16:07,362 --> 01:16:08,496
I Didn't Expect
To See You.

1353
01:16:08,496 --> 01:16:10,032
I Thought You'd Be
Getting Ready To Go.

1354
01:16:11,032 --> 01:16:11,032
Packing.

1355
01:16:11,666 --> 01:16:13,368
I Had To Tell You
Myself--

1356
01:16:13,368 --> 01:16:14,169
You And Gia.

1357
01:16:14,169 --> 01:16:15,436
I Mean, There's
Still Lots Of Things

1358
01:16:15,436 --> 01:16:16,537
To Work Out, But--

1359
01:16:16,537 --> 01:16:17,438
No, Please.

1360
01:16:17,438 --> 01:16:19,140
I Don't Need To Know
The Gruesome Details.

1361
01:16:19,140 --> 01:16:21,976
But I Didn't Want You
To Hear From Anyone Else.

1362
01:16:21,976 --> 01:16:22,577
No, It's Ok.

1363
01:16:22,577 --> 01:16:24,412
You Did
What You Had To.

1364
01:16:24,412 --> 01:16:26,581
There's No Need
To Explain.

1365
01:16:26,581 --> 01:16:28,316
Probably Wasn't
Even Fair

1366
01:16:28,316 --> 01:16:29,184
What We Were Asking,
Yeah?

1367
01:16:29,184 --> 01:16:32,253
I Mean, You Were
So Young When You Left,

1368
01:16:32,253 --> 01:16:33,121
And You've Been Gone
So Long,

1369
01:16:33,121 --> 01:16:35,289
How Could Makai
Still Be A Part Of You?

1370
01:16:35,289 --> 01:16:37,892
There's No Reason
It Should Be.

1371
01:16:37,892 --> 01:16:40,928
It's Just That
We Thought...

1372
01:16:40,928 --> 01:16:42,997
Maybe.

1373
01:16:42,997 --> 01:16:45,469
If You Came Home...

1374
01:16:48,469 --> 01:16:51,239
And You Saw It Again

1375
01:16:51,239 --> 01:16:52,340
That It Would Touch You

1376
01:16:52,340 --> 01:16:53,374
And You'd Have Enough
Of Your Mother

1377
01:16:53,374 --> 01:16:55,610
To Feel Some
Of The Things She Felt

1378
01:16:55,610 --> 01:16:57,111
About This Place.

1379
01:16:57,111 --> 01:16:58,446
It Was A Shot.

1380
01:16:58,446 --> 01:16:59,881
And At Least
You've Seen It,

1381
01:16:59,881 --> 01:17:02,617
 And At Least
 Now You Know.

1382
01:17:02,617 --> 01:17:05,591
You'll Have That
To Keep.

1383
01:17:10,591 --> 01:17:12,095
Here.

1384
01:17:14,095 --> 01:17:15,069
Open It.

1385
01:17:22,069 --> 01:17:23,575
Go On.

1386
01:17:27,575 --> 01:17:30,490
She'd Want You
To Have It.

1387
01:17:42,490 --> 01:17:44,492
Gia.

1388
01:17:44,492 --> 01:17:46,260
Oh, I Thought
You Were Gia.

1389
01:17:46,260 --> 01:17:48,329
Her Mom Said
She Was Here.

1390
01:17:48,329 --> 01:17:49,397
Have You Seen Her?

1391
01:17:49,397 --> 01:17:51,667
No, I Haven't.

1392
01:17:52,667 --> 01:17:54,603
She Took Off.

1393
01:17:55,603 --> 01:17:59,373
Do You Know
Where She Went?

1394
01:17:59,373 --> 01:18:00,107
Please, Kona.

1395
01:18:00,107 --> 01:18:01,009
Even If She Told You
Not To Tell,

1396
01:18:02,009 --> 01:18:03,644
It's Really Important.

1397
01:18:03,644 --> 01:18:06,015
I Need To Talk To Her.

1398
01:18:09,015 --> 01:18:11,986
She Said You Were
Gonna Sign The Papers
And Leave,

1399
01:18:11,986 --> 01:18:14,655
You Never Wanted
To See Us Again.

1400
01:18:14,655 --> 01:18:17,992
Any Of Us.

1401
01:18:17,992 --> 01:18:21,197
Good Riddance.
That's What She Said.

1402
01:18:23,197 --> 01:18:24,232
She Was Really Down,

1403
01:18:24,232 --> 01:18:27,306
Like Everything
Was Falling Apart.

1404
01:18:32,306 --> 01:18:33,274
Hey.

1405
01:18:33,274 --> 01:18:34,356
Sydney!

1406
01:18:48,356 --> 01:18:49,590
What's Going On?

1407
01:18:49,590 --> 01:18:50,224
What's The Matter?

1408
01:18:50,224 --> 01:18:51,759
Gia's Out There
Somewhere.

1409
01:18:51,759 --> 01:18:52,994
I Know It.

1410
01:18:52,994 --> 01:18:53,628
No Way.

1411
01:18:53,628 --> 01:18:55,363
She Wouldn't Surf Alone.

1412
01:18:55,363 --> 01:18:57,300
That's Too Crazy.

1413
01:18:59,300 --> 01:19:01,235
We Better Find Her.

1414
01:19:01,235 --> 01:19:03,573
I'll Take That Way.

1415
01:19:05,573 --> 01:19:07,713
Gia!

1416
01:19:12,713 --> 01:19:14,729
Kona: Gia!

1417
01:19:28,729 --> 01:19:30,124
Kona: Gia!

1418
01:19:57,124 --> 01:19:58,260
Gia.

1419
01:19:59,260 --> 01:20:01,132
Gia!

1420
01:20:05,132 --> 01:20:06,105
Gia.

1421
01:20:11,105 --> 01:20:12,807
Gia!

1422
01:20:12,807 --> 01:20:14,260
Gia!

1423
01:20:32,260 --> 01:20:35,554
Gia, I'm Coming!

1424
01:21:00,554 --> 01:21:03,124
Gia!

1425
01:21:03,124 --> 01:21:05,672
Gia, I'm Coming!

1426
01:21:17,672 --> 01:21:19,656
Oh, No.

1427
01:21:35,656 --> 01:21:37,295
[Coughing]

1428
01:21:41,295 --> 01:21:43,431
You Ok?

1429
01:21:43,431 --> 01:21:45,668
[Coughing]

1430
01:21:47,668 --> 01:21:49,837
What Happened?

1431
01:21:49,837 --> 01:21:50,838
[Coughing]

1432
01:21:50,838 --> 01:21:53,908
Went Over The Falls...

1433
01:21:53,908 --> 01:21:56,644
And Then Hit The Reef.

1434
01:21:56,644 --> 01:21:57,812
My Arms Hurts A Lot.

1435
01:21:57,812 --> 01:22:00,694
Hold On.
I'll Get You Back In.

1436
01:22:13,694 --> 01:22:14,929
Gia!

1437
01:22:14,929 --> 01:22:16,341
Sydney!

1438
01:22:27,341 --> 01:22:28,943
You're Too Late, Bra.

1439
01:22:28,943 --> 01:22:31,245
I've Already Been Rescued.

1440
01:22:31,245 --> 01:22:32,680
Oh, Yeah?

1441
01:22:32,680 --> 01:22:35,816
No More
Dumb Stunts, Ok?

1442
01:22:35,816 --> 01:22:36,817
Promise?

1443
01:22:36,817 --> 01:22:38,895
Yeah.

1444
01:22:47,895 --> 01:22:49,697
I'll Get Your Towel.

1445
01:22:49,697 --> 01:22:51,606
Don't Go Anywhere.

1446
01:22:58,606 --> 01:23:01,809
I Thought You'd Be
On A Plane By Now...

1447
01:23:01,809 --> 01:23:03,444
Long Gone.

1448
01:23:03,444 --> 01:23:05,579
Why'd You Come Back?

1449
01:23:05,579 --> 01:23:08,916
I Just Want To
Let You Know...

1450
01:23:08,916 --> 01:23:10,985
What I Said Before,

1451
01:23:10,985 --> 01:23:12,686
About Hating You,

1452
01:23:12,686 --> 01:23:14,655
Hating This Whole Place...

1453
01:23:14,655 --> 01:23:17,691
I Didn't Mean That.

1454
01:23:17,691 --> 01:23:20,961
Me, Too.

1455
01:23:20,961 --> 01:23:22,496
About Kona...

1456
01:23:22,496 --> 01:23:24,965
What I Let You Think...

1457
01:23:24,965 --> 01:23:26,033
It Wasn't True.

1458
01:23:26,033 --> 01:23:27,002
He Really Likes You,
Girl.

1459
01:23:28,002 --> 01:23:28,002
[Laughing]

1460
01:23:28,836 --> 01:23:31,513
Oh, One More Thing...

1461
01:23:39,513 --> 01:23:40,681
Ahh...Hey.

1462
01:23:40,681 --> 01:23:41,715
Hey, Watch That.

1463
01:23:41,715 --> 01:23:43,715
You All Right?

1464
01:23:41,715 --> 01:23:43,552
Yeah.

1465
01:23:44,552 --> 01:23:45,853
What Is It?

1466
01:23:45,853 --> 01:23:47,588
The Contract.

1467
01:23:47,588 --> 01:23:50,458
Look,
I Didn't Do It.

1468
01:23:50,458 --> 01:23:51,759
I Didn't Sign.

1469
01:23:51,759 --> 01:23:52,560
What?

1470
01:23:52,560 --> 01:23:53,727
Don't You
Get It?

1471
01:23:53,727 --> 01:23:55,296
I Told Them No.

1472
01:23:55,296 --> 01:23:57,732
We're Not
Selling Makai.

1473
01:23:58,732 --> 01:24:01,536
We're Gonna Live Here.

1474
01:24:02,536 --> 01:24:03,003
Gia: Yes!

1475
01:24:04,003 --> 01:24:05,573
Yes!

1476
01:24:05,573 --> 01:24:06,507
Ow!

1477
01:24:06,507 --> 01:24:08,742
Ha Ha Ha!

1478
01:24:08,742 --> 01:24:09,643
Whoo!

1479
01:24:09,643 --> 01:24:10,643
Yes!

1480
01:24:09,643 --> 01:24:10,511
Yeah!

1481
01:24:10,511 --> 01:24:12,078
I Kept Wanting
To Stay,

1482
01:24:12,078 --> 01:24:14,415
And I Am! I Am!

1483
01:24:14,415 --> 01:24:15,549
Yeah!

1484
01:24:15,549 --> 01:24:18,719
Have You Decided
What You'll Do?

1485
01:24:18,719 --> 01:24:20,955
Look For A Teaching Job.

1486
01:24:20,955 --> 01:24:22,756
Finish The Novel.

1487
01:24:22,756 --> 01:24:27,862
Maybe Open That School
Up At The Old Plantation.

1488
01:24:27,862 --> 01:24:28,563
[Chuckles]

1489
01:24:28,563 --> 01:24:30,998
I Guess We're
Kinda Wide Open.

1490
01:24:30,998 --> 01:24:34,602
You're Not Sorry
About Turning Down
All That Money?

1491
01:24:34,602 --> 01:24:35,636
Yeah.

1492
01:24:35,636 --> 01:24:36,871
Tsk!

1493
01:24:36,871 --> 01:24:37,472
Ha Ha!

1494
01:24:37,472 --> 01:24:39,607
That Was Sydney's Choice.

1495
01:24:39,607 --> 01:24:40,007
I'm Proud Of Her.

1496
01:24:41,007 --> 01:24:42,877
I Think She
Did The Right Thing.

1497
01:24:42,877 --> 01:24:46,431
I'm So Glad You
Guys Are Here.

1498
01:25:04,431 --> 01:25:07,468
I'm Not Sure If I'm
Saying Hello Or Good-Bye,

1499
01:25:07,468 --> 01:25:10,871
But I Know She's Out Here,
Watching Over Me,

1500
01:25:10,871 --> 01:25:13,574
And I Know I'll Have That,

1501
01:25:13,574 --> 01:25:14,675
Always.

1502
01:25:14,675 --> 01:25:16,877
So, Either Way...

1503
01:25:16,877 --> 01:25:18,612
It's All The Same.

1504
01:25:18,612 --> 01:25:21,055
It's All Aloha.

1505
01:25:28,055 --> 01:25:29,623
Hey, Sydney!

1506
01:25:29,623 --> 01:25:31,623
Whoo!

1507
01:25:29,623 --> 01:25:31,759

1508
01:25:31,759 --> 01:25:33,161
Hey!

1509
01:25:34,161 --> 01:25:35,596
All Right!
