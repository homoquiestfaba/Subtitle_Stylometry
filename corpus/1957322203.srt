1
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:42,300
Okay guys, I got a visual on the van. Looks
clean. Just one bloke driving, stand by, over.

2
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:53,720
Heads up, they're entering the lane. I'm
going to see this gas and get ready to fire.

3
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,640
Gas truck's loaded.

4
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,080
They're coming your way.

5
00:01:58,039 --> 00:01:59,979
Roger, we want no one hurt.

6
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:31,680
Get out.

7
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,160
Open the back doors, now.

8
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:36,827
We're taking your cargo. Move, move, move.

9
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,560
Surprise asshole.

10
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,010
You, get off the bike.

11
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,573
Get off the bike!

12
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:52,460
Come on, get over here. Piece of shit.

13
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:54,760
(Van)

14
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:57,920
(Muffled yelling)

15
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:20,002
Will passenger Degrazzi on
flight 227 to Singapore,

16
00:04:20,027 --> 00:04:24,144
please check in with airport
security, thank you.

17
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,794
Ladies and gentlemen, may I have your attention please.

18
00:04:39,819 --> 00:04:47,240
We are sorry to announce that flight 1021 to Newark has been cancelled due to severe weather over New Jersey.

19
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:50,879
 You may- you may, excuse me- please.

20
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:54,800
You may either take special charter flight 1443 to Los Angeles,

21
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:58,540
and then reroute to Newark, landing in 37 hours.

22
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:0,800
Or- excuse me, excuse me.

23
00:05:1,920 --> 00:05:5,159
 Scott, Jennifer, Phillip.

24
00:05:5,160 --> 00:05:7,343
Everything is safe and sound.

25
00:05:7,760 --> 00:05:10,627
Or, you can return tomorrow for flight 1222

26
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,920
departing at this same time.

27
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,560
Thank you.

28
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,600
So we get to stay in a hotel
room.

29
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,279
We can't afford a hotel for an
extra night

30
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:21,780
Why not?

31
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,080
I'll catch up with you.

32
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,480
Team, we are taking that
charter flight.

33
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:31,240
Oh, A hotel room sure would have been nice.

34
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,480
Gun!

35
00:05:58,800 --> 00:05:59,520
It's a lighter.

36
00:06:1,760 --> 00:06:2,760
Dr. Millhouse.

37
00:06:4,480 --> 00:06:6,480
There was a hijack attempt made on
the van.

38
00:06:7,760 --> 00:06:8,760
What?

39
00:06:9,400 --> 00:06:10,542
All the specimens are safe.

40
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,587
The project is still secure.

41
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:19,100
Why didn't you tell me something before?

42
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:22,500
Well, I'd rather not bother Dr Stewart and Dr Ryan.

43
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:25,119
Besides, we have to sit in
a flying tin can with them

44
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,960
for the next twenty hours.

45
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,600
I'll tell him when we land.

46
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:34,480
Absolutely. I think this is ah, it's better that we keep this between ourselves.

47
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:36,839
Yeah, I think you're right.

48
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:39,719
Ladies and gentlemen,
we are now boarding special charter flight

49
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:44,864
1443 to Los Angeles, all rows please
board at this time. Thank you.

50
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,400
Welcome aboard.

51
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,400
Oh, hi.

52
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,559
Welcome aboard, step this way.

53
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,520
How did it go, the tournament?

54
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:32,520
Oh, don't ask.

55
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:33,520
Oh, come on this way.

56
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,240
What's this about?

57
00:07:50,241 --> 00:07:51,740
Special cargo, science team.

58
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,016
Oh, you're the new date girl.

59
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:57,119
I have master's degrees in
bioengineering and physics

60
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,560
and a doctorate in gene therapy.

61
00:08:0,120 --> 00:08:2,120
Okay, welcome aboard.

62
00:08:3,120 --> 00:08:4,999
Patti. I think you've got it
under control up here.

63
00:08:5,000 --> 00:08:6,279
I'm just going to head up to the cockpit

64
00:08:6,280 --> 00:08:8,519
and see if me and the
other hillbillies can

65
00:08:8,520 --> 00:08:11,120
get this plane off the ground.

66
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,360
Hey, hey, hey,

67
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:22,239
Oh, you just made it by the hair of my chin.

68
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,799
 Yeah, save it. Ah, just point me to my seat, okay?

69
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:27,799
Oh, I say he's in a mood, all right, 14C in coach.

70
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:28,560
Thanks.

71
00:08:28,561 --> 00:08:30,427
Thank you, welcome aboard.

72
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,719
I have to put these away.

73
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:42,480
Where are you going to take those?

74
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,440
To stowage.

75
00:08:43,441 --> 00:08:46,519
Yeah, well ah, don't lose them okay, I got an early tee time.

76
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:47,520
Not to worry.

77
00:08:50,369 --> 00:08:51,320
Hello George.

78
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,320
Jack.

79
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,440
Jack.

80
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:54,640
Jack.

81
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:58,373
First my name, next thing you know you want my job.

82
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:1,839
Is our crate safe in the
cargo hold?

83
00:09:1,840 --> 00:09:4,239
You know, baggage handlers just throw everything around.

84
00:09:4,240 --> 00:09:5,959
Fred, is the cargo safe?

85
00:09:5,960 --> 00:09:7,679
Safe as houses.

86
00:09:7,680 --> 00:09:12,279
See Phillip, safe as houses
Fred's never let you down.

87
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:14,959
And I'm not about to start, Dr. Stuart.

88
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:21,920
And Lord, Jesus, if it shall be your will that I die
on this plane tonight.

89
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,919
Please let my Deliverance into
youre strong....

90
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:26,920
Pardon me, you're making me nervous.

91
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,239
This your first time flying,
girl?

92
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,200
Second.

93
00:09:31,201 --> 00:09:33,840
And it'll be my last if I have anything to say about it.

94
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:35,560
Relax, baby.

95
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:40,062
You know, they say more people are killed
each year by donkeys

96
00:09:40,087 --> 00:09:41,000
Than plane crashes.

97
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Yeah, right.

98
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,599
Ladies and gentlemen were about
to take off.

99
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:50,399
Please fasten your seatbelts
and make sure that your tray

100
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:52,079
tables are in their upright and
locked position.

101
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:56,160
Please observe that Captain Jack
has turned on the no smoking sign,

102
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,799
smoking is prohibited
throughout the aircraft.

103
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:2,160
Thank you and have a
very pleasant flight.

104
00:10:7,440 --> 00:10:8,440
Jesus Jack.

105
00:10:8,800 --> 00:10:10,800
You're not going to smoke all
the way through this flight again, are you?

106
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:12,896
You really should quit.

107
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:14,240
No reason to.

108
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,080
Scott, listen.

109
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,479
I'm sorry.

110
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,480
I've been dumped before
I know how it works, but I'm

111
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:50,093
I know how it works,

112
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,000
but I'm just not done being mad at you yet.

113
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:53,250
Oh really?-

114
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,820
Yes, really Jen.

115
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,999
Let's see, you broke up with me a week
ago after three years together.

116
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:2,719
I think it's a little much for
you to expect me to be what,

117
00:12:2,720 --> 00:12:4,160
'fine' with this so quickly.

118
00:12:6,280 --> 00:12:8,280
Well I'm sorry.

119
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,799
Recirculated air, it makes me
irritable.

120
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,119
Apparently.

121
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:18,920
 I'm gonna go
splash some water on my face,

122
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:23,799
You know, Jennifer, there's an
old chemists expression,

123
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:28,319
"Don't leave your lunch bag near
a lit Bunsen burner"

124
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,240
What?

125
00:12:29,241 --> 00:12:32,159
Don't date people you work with, Jennifer.

126
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,239
I never have.

127
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:34,616
Yeah, but you
never leave the lab Philip.

128
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:37,639
You never meet anybody you don't work with.

129
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:38,440
That's the
reason you never married.

130
00:12:38,441 --> 00:12:41,520
(laughing) She's got you there, doc.

131
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:45,420
Hey. Where do you think you're
going?

132
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:47,719
I just thought I'd see what
Courtney was doing.

133
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:50,279
No, Kourtney doesn't need your
shenanigans.

134
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:52,599
In fact, your shenanigans
bought you this seat -

135
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:53,600
And you're staying put.

136
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,680
Yeah but it's not my fault,
Shannon totally...

137
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:57,440
Oh, Shannon, Shannon, Shannon-

138
00:12:57,441 --> 00:12:58,720
It's always Shannon, isn't it?

139
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:0,720
You know, what?

140
00:13:0,721 --> 00:13:2,520
Why don't you take
responsibility for yourself?

141
00:13:4,360 --> 00:13:5,200
I'm putting on my music

142
00:13:5,201 --> 00:13:7,160
and I don't want to be disturbed for anything.

143
00:13:9,000 --> 00:13:11,540
(Whispering) Have a nice flight, loser.

144
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,440
(Voice) Millhouse?

145
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:37,520
Yes, this is Millhouse. What went wrong?

146
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,839
You didn't say anything about the bloke in the back of the van

147
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:40,840
with the bloody gun.

148
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:43,119
The specimens are in the cargo hold right now.

149
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,120
I paid you people.

150
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,759
Just go and switch them.

151
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:48,227
Now I have to do this?

152
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:51,216
Jesus Chri... I have to do this?

153
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:53,240
That's right. You're on your own mate.

154
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:15,479
Fellas look like you need
something.

155
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,639
Coffee? Pillow?

156
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:19,719
No, thank you. We are fine.

157
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:20,440
Yes, fine.

158
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,120
Okay

159
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:29,359
Jaffe, I have a bad feeling.

160
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:30,616
You always have a bad feeling.

161
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:35,439
I can't even remember the
planes we've been on.

162
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,599
Rome, Bombay, Singapore, Australia

163
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:38,800
Shut up.

164
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:42,200
Own father died
attempting this same mission.

165
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:46,119
I have waited for 11 years.

166
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:51,399
I have worked for 11 years to
accomplish what he could not.

167
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:52,759
It is my destiny.

168
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:56,639
It is yours to, to succeed.

169
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:58,640
I hope so, brother. I hope so.

170
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:0,280
Allah, Allah,

171
00:15:1,320 --> 00:15:2,320
America.

172
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,387
(Cargo door closes)

173
00:17:1,520 --> 00:17:2,320
I think I'll stretch my legs.

174
00:17:3,920 --> 00:17:4,999
You okay Dr. Stewart?

175
00:17:5,000 --> 00:17:6,118
I'm fine, friend.

176
00:17:6,119 --> 00:17:6,760
Thank you.

177
00:17:6,760 --> 00:17:7,760
I'll be right back.

178
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:14,880
Young man, excuse me.

179
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,160
Yes ma'am?

180
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:19,358
I smell cigarette smoke.

181
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:20,119
Really? that's terrible.

182
00:17:20,121 --> 00:17:22,719
I'm telling you I smell smoke!

183
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:25,040
I will see what we can do to
get that nasty smell out of your nose.

184
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,319
You just do that.

185
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:33,199
So, how are things in first?

186
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,776
Just taking care of the privileged passengers.

187
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,559
Life's rough for you, huh?

188
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:41,359
Mmh, enjoying the pit?

189
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,776
Ah- was that moving I
hear? No, it's that snotty Rich.

190
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,120
Cow you have to wait on

191
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:48,080
Bye, bye.

192
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:52,440
Dr. Millhouse.

193
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,040
What are you doing doctor?

194
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:1,040
Everything's okay.

195
00:18:3,400 --> 00:18:4,320
It's nothing,

196
00:18:4,321 --> 00:18:6,320
You should concern yourself with.

197
00:18:8,320 --> 00:18:9,599
That's odd.

198
00:18:9,600 --> 00:18:12,399
Here I thought I was head of
security for this outfit

199
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,799
Which would make whatever you're
doing to that cargo

200
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:15,800
Very much my concern.

201
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:21,040
Okay, listen fred, I'm going to level with you.

202
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:25,600
Phillip and Jennifer, they have, limited vision.

203
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:29,120
They just, they just don't know
how much money this technology is worth.

204
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,400
But you do.

205
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:32,799
Yeah, that's right.

206
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:34,239
I do,

207
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:37,896
And I can make sure that
there's a nice slice in it for you, Fred.

208
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,120
My good pal Fred, huh?

209
00:18:41,121 --> 00:18:45,959
I make a living. I work for my pay.

210
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:46,520
Yeah, but why should you buddy?

211
00:18:46,521 --> 00:18:47,879
Look this time next week

212
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:51,319
I'm in Hong Kong at a restaurant
eating sushi off a naked

213
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:53,599
woman's body and you can be
there with me.

214
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,320
Toasting to our Good
Fortune.

215
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,600
I don't like sushi

216
00:19:1,200 --> 00:19:3,200
The place I know makes a great burger.

217
00:19:3,560 --> 00:19:5,199
Come on, come on.

218
00:19:5,200 --> 00:19:6,599
Dr. Stewart, He trusts you-

219
00:19:6,600 --> 00:19:7,600
He trusts you even more.

220
00:19:8,960 --> 00:19:11,420
That's why this is going to work.

221
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:14,296
No, no, this isn't going to work.

222
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:20,439
This is over.

223
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:21,176
Jesus Christ Fred,

224
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:25,199
You really shouldn't fire a gun
on a plane, Fred.

225
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,039
I don't want to shoot his gun
at all.

226
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:29,599
Now we're going to go upstairs.

227
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:33,679
We're going to sit down together,

228
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:34,680
and we're going to fly to Los Angeles.

229
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:37,520
Dr. Stewart can deal with you when you land.

230
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:39,600
but for right now,

231
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:42,120
I'm going to keep all of this
between us.

232
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:45,720
Yeah, absolutely.

233
00:19:45,721 --> 00:19:50,559
I mean this will fuck up here, it's my bad, right?

234
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:55,400
I just absolutely I think
that's 100% accurate,

235
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:58,520
it's a mistake. I am so sorry that I-

236
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:23,960
Come on you son of a bitch, get up, get up. Son of a bitch.

237
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,167
Oh Fuck, Jesus no, Fred...

238
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:46,000
Phillip, I'm having a few reservations
about our involvement with new investors.

239
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:49,319
I mean, the research
isn't Advanced enough to put

240
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:54,000
control of the work into the
hands of CEOs and marketing suits.

241
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,800
We haven't done anywhere
near enough testing-

242
00:20:57,320 --> 00:21:3,919
Jennifer. I didn't want to mention this,
but to be bluntly honest.

243
00:21:3,920 --> 00:21:4,920
We're tapped.

244
00:21:6,520 --> 00:21:7,520
What?

245
00:21:7,720 --> 00:21:10,060
I've spent everything I have on the project.

246
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:12,799
Sold all my family's
lands and holdings.

247
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:15,119
We need money Jennifer.

248
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:19,479
We need money, facilities,
distribution.

249
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:23,039
Without new funding, It's all academic.

250
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:24,040
The work stops.

251
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:31,039
I have concerns brother.

252
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:33,600
Again? Why do you have concerns now?

253
00:21:34,538 --> 00:21:35,400
I fear we might fail.

254
00:21:35,401 --> 00:21:37,400
We cannot fail.

255
00:21:37,913 --> 00:21:40,947
We boarded the plane
without any trouble

256
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:43,039
We are in the air.

257
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:46,120
And soon we will be in the international
airspace.

258
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:49,399
But I'm worried now if you-

259
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:53,800
Worrying will not help. Faith will.

260
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,400
Faith in Allah.

261
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:58,187
Faith in your brother.

262
00:21:58,680 --> 00:21:59,880
Faith in yourself.

263
00:22:2,040 --> 00:22:4,400
We have a lot to do. Why don't you go to sleep.

264
00:22:5,270 --> 00:22:6,638
Get some rest.

265
00:22:7,310 --> 00:22:9,229
Thank you, brother.

266
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:12,040
All right, Jack.

267
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:13,879
Dreams do come true.

268
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:14,880
You drive for a while.

269
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:16,440
Let me go grab a cup of coffee.

270
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:18,360
You got it, Jack.

271
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Oh man.

272
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:38,380
Hey, why don't you two take that to
the bathroom?

273
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,240
Why, that's a fine idea.

274
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:41,440
Come on, Brad.

275
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,000
Yeah, mile high club.

276
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:47,093
I had to say something.

277
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:50,200
And it was a good something, girl. (laugh)

278
00:22:58,040 --> 00:22:59,040
Come on, brad.

279
00:23:7,400 --> 00:23:8,400
Can I get that for you darling?

280
00:23:9,360 --> 00:23:10,360
It's doctor.

281
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:14,096
Whoa, you're doing a lot of damage to that fine airplane coffee.

282
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:17,479
I don't think there's anything
I could do to make this coffee worse.

283
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:20,119
Besides, my boyfriend
likes it this way.

284
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:21,879
Well, I don't see your
boyfriend anywhere.

285
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:24,040
I'm a big girl, I can take care
of myself.

286
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,600
They've been in there forever.

287
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:42,800
They're probably making the
sweet, sweet love.

288
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:50,840
Oh, oh.

289
00:24:9,880 --> 00:24:11,320
I'm sorry, you had to get your
coffee yourself.

290
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:13,359
Oh, that's okay.

291
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:14,639
I got to meet the captain.

292
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:17,439
You mean Captain broken heart?

293
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:18,519
What do you mean?

294
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:19,759
Oh honey.

295
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:22,239
He's a one woman man, and she
died eight years ago.

296
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:24,519
He was flying a little Cessna
into San Francisco.

297
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:26,319
Hit a low patch of fog.

298
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:30,599
He lived. His wife and her
sister didn't.

299
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:31,733
Oh my God, that's terrible.

300
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:33,759
That's what they all
say, sweetie.

301
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:38,239
You know, I tried to play in
that Briar Patch a few years ago

302
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:41,519
and got stung. Mark my words: run.

303
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:43,160
I'll take that under
advisement.

304
00:24:57,800 --> 00:25:3,653
Okay. You're a winner, you're a winner, you're a winner, you're a winner. Okay.

305
00:25:4,000 --> 00:25:6,200
You're a winner, you're a winner.

306
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:33,439
No, you are not here to taunt
me again.

307
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,559
Just wanted you to see
my face again.

308
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:37,439
So it'll be burned in your
memory when I'm gone.

309
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:39,479
And on that Bahamas route.

310
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:40,480
talk to the Elbow because the hand

311
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:41,440
wants to smack you.

312
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:47,360
Help! A little help here?

313
00:25:47,361 --> 00:25:49,080
Hey, stewardess! Come on.

314
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:52,240
Think it's one of yours.

315
00:25:52,241 --> 00:25:54,639
Yes, sir.

316
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:55,640
What can I do for you?

317
00:26:8,360 --> 00:26:9,160
Getting a warning light from
Avionics.

318
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:12,920
That's probably just a short.

319
00:26:12,921 --> 00:26:17,239
Hey, George make me feel good
and go down to avionics and

320
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:18,240
check it out, will ya?

321
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:30,560
Karate girl, huh?

322
00:26:34,515 --> 00:26:35,080
Yeah.

323
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:37,840
So you got a man in the States.

324
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:41,359
Look, I'm sure you're a really
nice guy and everything, but

325
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:42,080
I'm so not in the mood.

326
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:45,980
Just asking a question.

327
00:26:48,849 --> 00:26:50,999
You know, you got some pretty
titties for a karate girl.

328
00:26:53,112 --> 00:26:54,360
You're gross.

329
00:26:58,920 --> 00:26:59,920
You're weird.

330
00:27:1,640 --> 00:27:2,160
Thanks.

331
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:23,639
My name's Courtney.

332
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:24,640
Ah, Gunther.

333
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:29,239
So what are you supposed to be, Gunther?

334
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:30,640
Some sort of vampire?

335
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:38,679
Sometimes. So what are you doing
in Australia?

336
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:42,079
I'm leaving Australia. I was in this huge
karate tournament.

337
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:46,888
We're qualifying for the World
Championships, broke my arm

338
00:27:46,913 --> 00:27:47,896
I can see that.

339
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:14,160
So, what are you doing in
Australia?

340
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:20,360
I'm studying aborigine Burial techniques.

341
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:22,119
Not really.

342
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:23,120
Oh, entirely.

343
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:39,719
I found this most fantastic coffin.

344
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:40,680
A coffin?

345
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:43,039
Yeah, it's in the hold.

346
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:46,999
My doberman is guarding it.

347
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,279
Is that right?

348
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:50,639
Yeah.

349
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,640
Wait, it's really quite
interesting.

350
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:57,759
George sure has been gone a while
hasn't he?

351
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:1,520
 Who wants to try reaching him on the intercom?

352
00:29:4,889 --> 00:29:5,680
He's not picking up.

353
00:29:5,681 --> 00:29:8,040
Maybe I'll wander down there and
see if he needs a hand.

354
00:29:9,720 --> 00:29:10,919
Are you kidding me?

355
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:11,840
I thought you were going to have to die before I ever

356
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:12,840
Got to sit in the big chair.

357
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,720
I'll be right back.

358
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:19,960
Don't even think about it.

359
00:29:19,961 --> 00:29:22,279
If I wanted a bunch of teenagers
jumping all around me.

360
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:23,200
I would have stayed at home.

361
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:28,759
Listen, I have more work here
than God, and if I don't finish it

362
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:30,159
before we land, I'm dead.

363
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:32,799
Okay? so I-

364
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:33,400
Nice to meet you, too.

365
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:42,400
George? George.

366
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:45,453
Come on, quit messing around.

367
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:51,333
What the hell has happened here?

368
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:57,120
Oh, oh, God!

369
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:0,496
Some one next door doing the same thing.

370
00:30:0,520 --> 00:30:1,680
Let's give them a run for their
money.

371
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:15,520
(screaming)

372
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:22,400
Is everything okay in here?

373
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:24,040
Where the hell have you been?

374
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:25,000
We have a situation.

375
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:25,600
What?

376
00:30:25,601 --> 00:30:27,080
Get ground control on the
horn and tell them we have

377
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:28,943
an emergency situation up here.
I'll be right back.

378
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:35,040
(humming)

379
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:41,040
Oh, Jeez.

380
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:46,667
What they don't know won't hurt them.

381
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:53,520
Ow!

382
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:56,040
What is that?

383
00:31:5,320 --> 00:31:6,600
This is recyclable. Dammit.

384
00:31:8,480 --> 00:31:11,040
Pattie, why are you putting recyclables in the trash?

385
00:31:13,147 --> 00:31:14,437
Oh, that stings.

386
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:31,800
Something wrong?

387
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:34,800
You see those two guys over
there?

388
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,319
Yeah?

389
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:40,453
 Do you remember them
boarding?

390
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:43,759
No, now that you've mentioned it.

391
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:44,760
Me neither.

392
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:49,543
And I don't see anything listed
on the Manifest for those seats.

393
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:52,640
Pattie, could you keep
everyone out of here for a few minutes?

394
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:54,880
Certainly Captain.

395
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:56,200
Thanks.

396
00:32:7,120 --> 00:32:10,440
Gentlemen, may I have a word
with you, please?

397
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:12,160
Please, this way.

398
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:23,199
Know what the hell you're doing
on my plane.

399
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:26,359
We are flying to America!

400
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:27,376
Cut the shit and tell me what the

401
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:28,120
hell you're doing on this
flight.

402
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:30,867
Sir, sir, we are very sorry, but,

403
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:34,880
we do not have proper papers.

404
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:38,399
I don't think you realize how
difficult it is to get work

405
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,400
visa for America and other
countries.

406
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:42,760
No, no, it's okay, it's okay Jaffe.

407
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:48,599
My brother and I we, we will
make a great electricians in your country.

408
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:50,399
We can fix anything.

409
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:51,400
Anything! it is true, anything.

410
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:55,296
Oh man. You guys are just illegals.

411
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:57,239
Sir, please.

412
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:58,617
Quiet, quiet.

413
00:32:58,789 --> 00:32:59,656
Listen to me.

414
00:33:1,600 --> 00:33:3,200
I'm going to deal with you once I
get back to Los Angeles.

415
00:33:3,280 --> 00:33:5,720
Now I want you to go back and sit
in your seats and remain there

416
00:33:6,120 --> 00:33:7,520
for the rest of the flight, right?

417
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:11,879
INS can deal with you

418
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:13,680
Once we get back to Los Angeles,
now go sit.

419
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:19,601
Jaffe.

420
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:24,520
Faith. Faith, my brother, faith.

421
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:32,512
We've got trouble.

422
00:33:32,537 --> 00:33:34,839
I've been hailing Ground
Control and every frequency.

423
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:36,159
Nobody's responding.

424
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:37,080
Shit.

425
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:37,600
Are you sure?

426
00:33:37,601 --> 00:33:39,216
Checked, double-checked triple-checked.

427
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:42,359
All right.

428
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:44,119
This is what we're going to do
Jack.

429
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:46,239
I'm gonna go check the seat
phone and see if I can reach Ground

430
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:46,800
Control that way.

431
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:55,600
Hi.

432
00:33:55,601 --> 00:33:56,676
You sure you're the
captain?

433
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:58,679
You never seem to be flying the
plane.

434
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:0,679
Hey, I can fly This Plane
blind.

435
00:34:0,680 --> 00:34:2,399
Listen.

436
00:34:2,400 --> 00:34:3,809
I know this is going to sound a
little weird.

437
00:34:3,833 --> 00:34:4,680
Probably.

438
00:34:5,282 --> 00:34:7,681
Can I use your credit card?

439
00:34:8,782 --> 00:34:9,594
That is weird.

440
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:11,399
What, are you gonna order takeout?

441
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:14,478
No, I just need to make a quick
call.

442
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:16,599
It's personal and the airline's
doesn't like it when I make

443
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:18,679
personal calls from the cockpit

444
00:34:18,679 --> 00:34:20,639
A personal call? A girlfriend?

445
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:23,359
Uh, no,

446
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:26,319
I haven't had one of those in
quite a while.

447
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:26,936
Ah.

448
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:28,199
What about a cell phone?

449
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:31,039
I have one but they really
don't work in planes and

450
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,918
certainly not this far over the
ocean.

451
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:35,199
You don't have a credit card?

452
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:41,478
Declined. It's not going to be a
long call.

453
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:43,080
What do you say?

454
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:48,360
Sure, no problem.

455
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:53,119
One call no shopping.

456
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:54,719
Thanks.

457
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:57,040
I'll bring it right back.

458
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:13,879
I need to be connected to control
tower.

459
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:19,079
My name is Captain Jack Russell
clearance code Alpha 154 triple

460
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:21,080
seven. Thank you.

461
00:35:23,478 --> 00:35:23,960
Yes.

462
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:24,800
Hello.

463
00:35:24,801 --> 00:35:26,039
My name is Captain Jack
Russell.

464
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:30,159
I'm on flight 1443 heavy
Melbourne to Los Angeles.

465
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:31,239
Who am I talking to? Over.

466
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:32,519
Roger, 1443.

467
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:34,399
This is Bob Campbell.

468
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:36,119
Hey, you're not calling on a
state of calm line.

469
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:37,120
Captain where are you calling from? Over.

470
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:39,600
I'm on a seat phone in the main cabin.

471
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:42,000
We have an emergency situation up here, over.

472
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:44,960
What's the nature of your
emergency captain?

473
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:46,120
Unidentified.

474
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:48,800
There's some kind of-

475
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:49,800
Say again?

476
00:35:49,801 --> 00:35:51,067
We have a man down.

477
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:53,840
1443. We lost you there.

478
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:56,760
Hello?

479
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:58,000
Hello?

480
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,000
Come in, 1443.

481
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:1,800
Mike!

482
00:36:2,040 --> 00:36:3,040
Oh, come on.

483
00:36:5,560 --> 00:36:7,693
Everybody, please remain seated!

484
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:59,400
Sorry folks, the situation is under control, if you all could just remain seated.

485
00:37:1,560 --> 00:37:3,959
Hey, Doc, you're one of the
science people, right?

486
00:37:3,960 --> 00:37:4,480
Yeah.

487
00:37:4,481 --> 00:37:6,760
Well, I think there's something
you ought to know about.

488
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:16,679
That's all we got? Unidentified?
'Some kind of' .. Some kind of what?

489
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:17,760
that's all we got before we cut
off.

490
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:21,800
It's FAA time people.

491
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:55,679
Everybody, back to coach!

492
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:57,080
Come on, Dr. Stewart.

493
00:37:57,480 --> 00:38:0,959
Come on ma'am, let's go.

494
00:38:0,960 --> 00:38:2,839
We're going to be safer back there, come on, let's go.

495
00:38:2,840 --> 00:38:5,573
I'd rather be dead than go back to coach.

496
00:38:8,440 --> 00:38:9,440
Jan! Jan! Jan!

497
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:13,440
(screaming)

498
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:36,760
Here!

499
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:44,439
Phillip, what the hell is happening here?

500
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:45,794
Well, I knew the cloning
process would very

501
00:38:45,819 --> 00:38:49,000
likely quadruple their
size but not this fast!

502
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:51,079
Scott! Scott, did you
know this was going to happen?

503
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:53,759
I had no idea this was gonna
happen Philip, no, this is

504
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:55,199
totally, totally unprecedented.

505
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:57,159
Don't, do not touch them.

506
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:57,480
Oh, thanks.

507
00:38:57,481 --> 00:38:59,960
Yeah, because you know, I was
thinking about going and petting him.

508
00:39:32,522 --> 00:39:34,422
That thing almost got him.

509
00:39:34,447 --> 00:39:35,839
Yeah, but it didn't.

510
00:39:36,206 --> 00:39:38,292
It almost took my head off.

511
00:39:40,190 --> 00:39:40,840
You're lucky.

512
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:41,698
It's still

513
00:39:42,323 --> 00:39:45,319
...working.

514
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:47,920
You're lucky that thing didn't eat you.

515
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:49,640
You know, I never did get your
name.

516
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:53,239
It's Jennifer.

517
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:54,879
Jack.

518
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:57,239
Enough Jibber-jabber, where are they
where those things go?

519
00:39:57,240 --> 00:39:58,679
They obviously retreated.

520
00:39:58,680 --> 00:39:59,680
What the hell is crawling all over

521
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:0,880
my plane killing people.

522
00:40:0,881 --> 00:40:3,239
Yo, what the hell are
those things?

523
00:40:3,240 --> 00:40:4,440
They're scorpions.

524
00:40:4,600 --> 00:40:5,759
You're kidding.

525
00:40:5,760 --> 00:40:6,440
Scorpions.

526
00:40:6,441 --> 00:40:7,959
I seen Scorpions on one of them

527
00:40:7,960 --> 00:40:10,519
animal shows, they're about that
big.

528
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:11,520
that ain't no scorpion.

529
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:15,239
Yeah, and there's nothing
listed on your cargo manifest

530
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:16,960
about giant scorpions with your
equipment.

531
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:20,759
They weren't giant scorpions
when we put them on the plane.

532
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:24,759
They were simply dormant
specimens and we listed them as such.

533
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:26,039
There's no way they could
have gotten out.

534
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:29,399
They were in a secure containment crate.

535
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:31,199
See, the canisters must have

536
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:33,759
been jostled when your
plane lost control.

537
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:37,479
Well, that'd be a good theory
except for the fact that we

538
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:41,119
lost control because one of
those big ass son of a bitches

539
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:42,959
was in the cockpit!

540
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:44,119
What?

541
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:47,159
Yeah, and I take it kind of
personally.

542
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:48,427
But just how big is

543
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:51,059
this big ass, son of a bitch in
the cockpit?

544
00:40:51,060 --> 00:40:52,327
Big.

545
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:53,600
Mighty bigger?

546
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:54,760
Yeah.

547
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:59,400
There's a queen.

548
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:13,256
You the FAA Specialist?

549
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:13,880
Yes sir, I'm Curtis Burnham.

550
00:41:13,881 --> 00:41:14,959
This is Mr. Highball,

551
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:15,600
Mr. Brick

552
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:17,880
Mike Rowe.

553
00:41:17,881 --> 00:41:19,960
Hi, Mike.

554
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:23,479
Bob's been keeping an eye on
things here.

555
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:24,136
Bob?

556
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:25,815
Wow, that was fast.

557
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:26,880
This is Mr. Burnham.

558
00:41:26,905 --> 00:41:27,825
Curtis, please.

559
00:41:27,850 --> 00:41:28,815
Hi, Bob.

560
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:33,319
So how long since the phone
call from that plane?

561
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:35,759
63 minutes 22 seconds?

562
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:36,400
Okay.

563
00:41:36,401 --> 00:41:39,239
Have you had any contact at all
with anyone on the plane since?

564
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:42,399
Any Ransom calls, any possible
hijackers, or terrorists?

565
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,400
No, nothing like that.

566
00:41:43,401 --> 00:41:46,359
Just that short phone call then
a sharp dive an altitude about

567
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:48,759
10 minutes ago, but it looks
like they leveled off.

568
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:49,120
Yeah.

569
00:41:49,121 --> 00:41:50,519
I see you've got them on radar.

570
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:52,760
Yeah, we got them on radar, but
that's all we got.

571
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:55,120
Well good work, Bob.

572
00:41:55,121 --> 00:41:56,239
Good work.

573
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:58,119
Hey, you mind if my guys sit
there?

574
00:41:58,120 --> 00:41:59,120
No, not at all.

575
00:42:7,160 --> 00:42:8,239
Okay highball.

576
00:42:8,240 --> 00:42:10,039
I need schematics to the plane.

577
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:16,239
I need cargo manifest, crew
complement, passenger manifest

578
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:18,719
brick establish a link to
Strategic Air Command and the

579
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:19,759
National Weather Center.

580
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:21,959
I want to know if there's any
military in that airspace and

581
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:23,199
what the storm is going to do.

582
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:24,016
Yes sir.

583
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:26,760
What the hell is going on up there?

584
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,759
Jennifer now, you know, I'd
help if I didn't have to stand back.

585
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:37,440
Watch the arm.

586
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:50,919
Is everybody here?

587
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:52,479
Everybody who is here, is here.

588
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:56,159
I think we can safely say that
everybody who is not here,

589
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:56,960
is dead.

590
00:42:56,961 --> 00:42:59,399
Where's Fred?

591
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:0,400
One of the
specimens must have got him.

592
00:43:1,560 --> 00:43:2,560
Oh, poor Fred.

593
00:43:2,600 --> 00:43:3,080
And listen people.

594
00:43:3,081 --> 00:43:4,479
I've got to get off of this
plane.

595
00:43:4,480 --> 00:43:4,980
I have a very very important
meeting-

596
00:43:5,040 --> 00:43:6,173
What's your name?

597
00:43:6,960 --> 00:43:7,960
McCellan.

598
00:43:8,120 --> 00:43:9,120
McCellan?

599
00:43:9,920 --> 00:43:11,680
We all know that you have an important
meeting.

600
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:13,880
Okay?

601
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:18,079
Hey, didn't you guys say that you
could build anything to fix anything?

602
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:19,719
Oh, yes, of course.

603
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:21,720
Definitely Sir, but we need to

604
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:23,639
know more about what we are up against.

605
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:25,479
Yes, in order for us to properly defend ourselves.

606
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:27,679
They're giant scorpions.

607
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:29,399
Okay?

608
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:31,399
No problem.

609
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:33,599
We have other problems.

610
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:35,319
Yeah, what's that?

611
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:37,479
Well, to start with,
my crew is dead.

612
00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:39,159
And I'm the only one left who
can land This Plane.

613
00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:41,599
Well do us all a big favor and
don't die.

614
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:43,699
Well, that was a big part of my plan.

615
00:43:43,724 --> 00:43:44,232
Good.

616
00:43:44,257 --> 00:43:45,935
What else?

617
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:46,856
Communications are down.

618
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:50,079
We need to talk to the ground
in order to plan this thing.

619
00:43:50,080 --> 00:43:53,480
Plus we need to get into avionics
and activate the Apu.

620
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:55,399
Apu? What is the freakin Apu?

621
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:58,079
Auxiliary power unit, sir?

622
00:43:58,080 --> 00:44:0,159
Exactly.

623
00:44:0,160 --> 00:44:1,959
What's your name again?

624
00:44:1,960 --> 00:44:3,599
Jaffe, Jaffe sir.

625
00:44:3,600 --> 00:44:5,599
Jaffe. Good.

626
00:44:5,600 --> 00:44:6,160
All right.

627
00:44:6,161 --> 00:44:9,879
We also need weapons. Between
those pincers and the Venom

628
00:44:9,880 --> 00:44:11,679
that they're packing in their
tails were going to need some

629
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:12,080
heavy-duty artillery.

630
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:16,400
Alright. Well,

631
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:20,320
let's find out what we got.

632
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:29,479
Okey-dokey. Strategic Air

633
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:31,159
Command says they've got nobody
in that airspace.

634
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:33,399
Thank God for small favors.

635
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:37,479
They want to know if there's
anything they can do to help

636
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:38,799
Tell them thanks, and we'll let them
know.

637
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:41,599
What does the National Weather
Center say about that storm?

638
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:44,579
Well, the good news is that
it's not going to get any worse.

639
00:44:44,580 --> 00:44:44,820
And the bad news?

640
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:46,080
It's not gonna get any better.

641
00:44:46,080 --> 00:44:46,800
Yeah, of course.

642
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:53,680
What have you got?

643
00:44:56,920 --> 00:44:59,480
We can do it! Good! We can do it!

644
00:45:0,040 --> 00:45:1,159
Should we be ready then to make our way
down.

645
00:45:1,160 --> 00:45:2,120
The cargo hold?

646
00:45:2,120 --> 00:45:2,840
Yes!

647
00:45:2,841 --> 00:45:4,039
Sounds like it.

648
00:45:4,040 --> 00:45:4,760
But those things are down there though.

649
00:45:4,761 --> 00:45:5,799
Those things are
everywhere.

650
00:45:5,800 --> 00:45:6,480
What do you want?

651
00:45:6,481 --> 00:45:8,160
You know, you're getting bossy.

652
00:45:8,220 --> 00:45:9,160
Sorry!

653
00:45:9,161 --> 00:45:10,560
Tool Box. Tool boxes.

654
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:12,159
Yeah, the tool boxes are

655
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:12,800
in the cargo hold.

656
00:45:12,801 --> 00:45:14,080
They would be most helpful.

657
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:18,999
We can definitely use those. Listen, how many of those things are there, do you think?

658
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,239
Worst case scenario, 20.

659
00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:21,856
Minus the dead one, 19.

660
00:45:22,460 --> 00:45:23,460
19!

661
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:26,039
You're saying, with the giant
one locked in the cockpit,

662
00:45:26,040 --> 00:45:28,279
there's eighteen of those
things roaming the plane?

663
00:45:28,280 --> 00:45:30,776
Listen, I'm going to take those odds, and I'm going to go down to the APU

664
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:31,480
I'm going to turn that
thing on.

665
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:31,680
Okay?

666
00:45:32,080 --> 00:45:33,080
Okay, I'll go with Captain Jack.

667
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:33,880
Highball.

668
00:45:33,881 --> 00:45:34,960
What have you got on that
plane?

669
00:45:35,560 --> 00:45:36,560
Just a second,

670
00:45:39,080 --> 00:45:43,200
Boom. full schematics, passenger
manifest, crew complement, cargo manifest.

671
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:46,439
Okay, highball find me a
way to talk to that plane.

672
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:47,480
You got it.

673
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:56,187
Is everybody ready?

674
00:45:57,320 --> 00:46:1,159
Okay, I will now open the hatch.

675
00:46:1,160 --> 00:46:3,620
Do it slow. Let me have the flashlight.

676
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:18,880
Be careful.

677
00:46:44,320 --> 00:46:45,400
You guys have got to be kidding
me.

678
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:47,320
This stuff is never going to
work.

679
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:50,320
You know, what if he's got a
better idea.

680
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:52,079
Sure we'd all be real glad to hear it.

681
00:46:52,080 --> 00:46:53,080
Yeah, I got a great idea.

682
00:46:53,081 --> 00:46:55,880
Why don't we just land just
bug-infested heap and get another plane?

683
00:46:57,480 --> 00:47:0,320
Great, right because
we're over the ocean stupid.

684
00:47:6,800 --> 00:47:7,800
Alright, avionics is this way.

685
00:47:8,320 --> 00:47:9,760
Yeah but our tools are that way.

686
00:47:9,800 --> 00:47:11,880
Okay, Let's get the tools first and
we'll deal with avionics.

687
00:47:13,320 --> 00:47:15,599
No, You and I are going to
avionics.

688
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:16,880
I need your expertise.

689
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:20,680
Oh Really? what for?

690
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,900
I need someone to hold a flashlight,
you think you can handle that?

691
00:47:26,920 --> 00:47:27,920
Let's go.

692
00:47:37,960 --> 00:47:39,599
I will find the tools Dracula.

693
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:40,959
Did you find any weapon?

694
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:42,879
My name is not Dracula.

695
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:43,680
It's Gunther.

696
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:47,879
Actually it's not Gunther, it's Joe.

697
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:49,599
I'm from New Jersey.

698
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:55,680
I've just been using the accent
to impress women. My life is a sham.

699
00:47:56,440 --> 00:47:57,280
Dracula,

700
00:47:57,280 --> 00:47:58,280
um, Gunther,

701
00:47:58,880 --> 00:47:59,400
Joe.

702
00:47:59,401 --> 00:48:0,959
This is a great story.

703
00:48:0,960 --> 00:48:3,599
But this is not the right time
for a personal identity crisis.

704
00:48:3,600 --> 00:48:4,400
Yeah?

705
00:48:4,400 --> 00:48:4,960
Yeah.

706
00:48:4,960 --> 00:48:5,800
Yeah.

707
00:48:5,800 --> 00:48:6,160
Yeah.

708
00:48:6,160 --> 00:48:6,800
Yeah.

709
00:48:6,801 --> 00:48:9,159
Hey, this is no storytelling
time.

710
00:48:9,160 --> 00:48:9,600
Huh?

711
00:48:9,600 --> 00:48:10,080
There are scorpions.

712
00:48:10,080 --> 00:48:10,800
Come on.

713
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:11,480
Come on, brother.

714
00:48:11,481 --> 00:48:14,079
Come, hey, hey, Dracu- Gunther

715
00:48:14,080 --> 00:48:14,400
come.

716
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:22,400
So where you from

717
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:23,960
Small talk, eh?

718
00:48:25,160 --> 00:48:26,879
Moved around a lot, army brat.

719
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:30,919
Army brat? sounds about
right.

720
00:48:30,920 --> 00:48:31,920
You?

721
00:48:32,600 --> 00:48:34,133
Well, darlin' I wake up

722
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:34,600
up every morning.

723
00:48:34,601 --> 00:48:37,959
and I thank God that I'm a Texan.

724
00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:38,656
That explains a lot.

725
00:48:38,680 --> 00:48:40,080
What do you mean by that?

726
00:48:40,760 --> 00:48:41,760
Nothing.

727
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:43,320
(screaming)

728
00:48:43,321 --> 00:48:44,453
Oh Geez, oh Geez.

729
00:48:46,920 --> 00:48:47,920
come on.

730
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:55,707
So, uh, you people are scientists?

731
00:48:56,080 --> 00:48:57,080
That's right.

732
00:48:57,720 --> 00:49:0,879
So fill a brother in, right?
Why you making giant scorpions?

733
00:49:0,880 --> 00:49:4,679
Um, complicated.

734
00:49:4,680 --> 00:49:5,296
Try us.

735
00:49:5,320 --> 00:49:10,479
We were trying to synthesize a
biogenetic pathogen that would

736
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:13,039
aggressively combat disease.

737
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:14,840
Diseases like AIDS, cancer,

738
00:49:15,880 --> 00:49:19,399
components of this pathogen are
found in great abundance in

739
00:49:19,400 --> 00:49:20,599
scorpion hormonal secretions.

740
00:49:20,600 --> 00:49:24,719
So you were raising giant
fucking scorpions.

741
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:25,787
Um, not exactly, no.

742
00:49:27,880 --> 00:49:29,319
Then what the hell do you mean?

743
00:49:29,320 --> 00:49:31,456
Those animals never existed before,

744
00:49:31,800 --> 00:49:34,520
they are an entirely new
species.

745
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:35,456
You guys are saying that these

746
00:49:35,480 --> 00:49:38,679
things are like say the Killer
Bees where you genetically

747
00:49:38,680 --> 00:49:41,959
crossed an African Honey Bee
with the American Honey Bee and

748
00:49:41,960 --> 00:49:43,760
Bam the killer bee was born?

749
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:44,920
Precisely.

750
00:49:45,640 --> 00:49:47,919
Damn, baby, you sexy and smart.

751
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:48,576
Oh, I saw it on the news.

752
00:49:48,980 --> 00:49:51,380
Yeah Well and just what did you
cross these giant fucking

753
00:49:51,720 --> 00:49:52,999
scorpions with?

754
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,879
Oh,lots of things
but the primary

755
00:49:55,880 --> 00:50:0,479
induction was the DNA from the
fossilized remains of a

756
00:50:0,480 --> 00:50:2,879
Paleolithic scorpion millions
of years old.

757
00:50:2,880 --> 00:50:6,320
So you made Jurassic Park
scorpions?

758
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:19,400
Look over there

759
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:32,519
What is this?

760
00:50:32,520 --> 00:50:34,296
Looks like a dead
skin of a Scorpion?

761
00:50:34,320 --> 00:50:37,320
It's not mine.

762
00:50:52,120 --> 00:50:53,120
Oh Shit!

763
00:51:3,920 --> 00:51:6,987
There will be more scorpions, everybody hurry!

764
00:51:12,760 --> 00:51:13,760
Ow!

765
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:19,880
This is bad.

766
00:51:20,120 --> 00:51:21,120
How bad?

767
00:51:21,480 --> 00:51:22,080
Real bad.

768
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:30,520
Hurry! Come on!

769
00:51:34,600 --> 00:51:34,880
Hurry up.

770
00:51:35,880 --> 00:51:36,880
The whole circuit board is
melted.

771
00:51:36,881 --> 00:51:40,399
We're gonna have to turn on the
auxiliary power unit at the

772
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:40,880
source.

773
00:51:41,600 --> 00:51:42,600
Okay?

774
00:51:43,880 --> 00:51:45,119
But we've got bigger problems.

775
00:51:45,120 --> 00:51:46,839
We do?

776
00:51:46,840 --> 00:51:48,039
See those cables?

777
00:51:48,040 --> 00:51:49,240
The shredded ones?

778
00:51:49,640 --> 00:51:50,640
Yeah.

779
00:51:51,320 --> 00:51:52,080
Those control the landing gear.

780
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:55,727
(Gunther screaming)

781
00:52:13,960 --> 00:52:14,960
Where is it?

782
00:52:16,320 --> 00:52:17,320
APU, APU...

783
00:52:19,360 --> 00:52:20,360
Jack?

784
00:52:24,840 --> 00:52:26,240
Jen, find the switch!

785
00:52:27,480 --> 00:52:28,240
This it?

786
00:52:28,241 --> 00:52:30,307
Yes! Prime it. Get out of here.

787
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:40,400
How goes it Curtis?

788
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:43,199
Well not as quickly as I'd like.

789
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:44,456
Anything I can do to help?

790
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:47,799
Actually, Yes Mike there is
they passed over Hawaii hours

791
00:52:47,800 --> 00:52:51,079
ago? And so I'm operating under
the assumption that the plane

792
00:52:51,080 --> 00:52:53,479
will be landing directly here
and she's going to be coming in

793
00:52:53,480 --> 00:52:55,079
pretty fast and hard.

794
00:52:55,080 --> 00:52:58,159
When that happens, I don't want
to be scrambling for Runway.

795
00:52:58,160 --> 00:52:59,080
I hear that.

796
00:53:9,600 --> 00:53:10,600
Quick! in here.

797
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:23,359
I'm cross-referencing the passenger manifest with the customer listing of

798
00:53:23,360 --> 00:53:24,880
every cell phone company Nationwide.

799
00:53:25,220 --> 00:53:26,999
What, you can do that?

800
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:28,000
Of course not

801
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:29,456
that would be in violation

802
00:53:29,480 --> 00:53:31,079
of these citizens rights to privacy.

803
00:53:31,080 --> 00:53:33,319
Yeah, either that or Industrial Espionage.

804
00:53:33,320 --> 00:53:34,720
Yeah, I forget which.

805
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:36,080
I need two more minutes.

806
00:53:41,160 --> 00:53:43,320
Hey, I heard about your wife

807
00:53:46,680 --> 00:53:47,799
you want to talk about this
now?

808
00:53:47,800 --> 00:53:49,159
I'm sorry.

809
00:53:49,160 --> 00:53:51,320
Let's talk about the APU some more.

810
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:57,480
All right, it's just

811
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:0,760
I feel like

812
00:54:3,800 --> 00:54:5,333
I still miss her and...

813
00:54:8,800 --> 00:54:11,320
There's a lot to enjoy in this
world Jack.

814
00:54:14,080 --> 00:54:16,480
I think she'd want you to be
doing that.

815
00:54:16,520 --> 00:54:20,799
Enjoying the world instead of clinging to loss
for the rest of your life.

816
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:23,680
That's real understanding of you.

817
00:54:24,600 --> 00:54:30,800
Hey, I see a sad guy who could be happy if he let himself.

818
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:36,400
You've got a hell of a bedside manner, doc.

819
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:39,080
if you only knew.

820
00:54:48,080 --> 00:54:49,360
I think we better get out of here.

821
00:54:49,360 --> 00:54:49,780
Let's get out of here.

822
00:54:49,800 --> 00:54:50,600
I think it's clear.

823
00:55:1,600 --> 00:55:2,320
Jack.

824
00:55:2,920 --> 00:55:3,920
Oh, shit.

825
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:14,320
Rest in peace, you big-ass son of a bitch!

826
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:21,400
Quick, Jack!

827
00:55:21,840 --> 00:55:22,840
Behind you!

828
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:24,600
Look out!

829
00:55:25,560 --> 00:55:26,560
Get up!

830
00:55:26,560 --> 00:55:27,560
(Jack grunts)

831
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:35,200
(Scorpion squeals)

832
00:55:39,600 --> 00:55:41,333
Well, that was impressive.

833
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:42,576
So, what were you guys doing?

834
00:55:42,600 --> 00:55:46,319
Oh, you know, we were just practicing while you were gone.

835
00:55:46,320 --> 00:55:48,160
Good work.

836
00:55:55,360 --> 00:55:56,360
Hey.

837
00:56:21,800 --> 00:56:23,079
Listen, I need to get into the
cockpit.

838
00:56:23,080 --> 00:56:26,599
So we got to figure out how to
get that big ass sumbitch out of there.

839
00:56:26,599 --> 00:56:27,480
Mr. Jack!

840
00:56:27,481 --> 00:56:28,679
Mr. Jack.

841
00:56:28,680 --> 00:56:33,959
We have fashioned a weapon for
that exact Purpose!

842
00:56:33,960 --> 00:56:37,239
Maybe we should be building
something to contain her.

843
00:56:37,240 --> 00:56:38,080
Contain my ass.

844
00:56:38,081 --> 00:56:42,880
Let's see what bad business my
Eastern Brothers here have built.

845
00:56:45,880 --> 00:56:46,160
Here.

846
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:47,720
Bring it up.

847
00:56:54,320 --> 00:56:54,800
I ain't got nothing to say.

848
00:56:58,080 --> 00:56:58,880
No, I'm with the man

849
00:56:58,881 --> 00:57:1,680
That's got the meeting. That
shit ain't gonna kill shit.

850
00:57:1,760 --> 00:57:5,479
Mr. Omar, you are not
seeing the whole picture.

851
00:57:5,480 --> 00:57:8,799
This is, this is just the body armor.

852
00:57:8,800 --> 00:57:10,000
It goes with this!

853
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:11,880
Here.

854
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:13,360
That's impressive.

855
00:57:13,400 --> 00:57:17,079
This power pack goes on the
back and we have lined this

856
00:57:17,080 --> 00:57:22,479
jumpsuit with new print for
insulation, but the user is

857
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:24,400
going to feel a little tingles

858
00:57:26,800 --> 00:57:27,160
Uh, where did you get that neoprene?

859
00:57:27,161 --> 00:57:31,159
Oh, we found a wetsuit Down
Below in one of the suitcases.

860
00:57:31,160 --> 00:57:32,319
Oh man. That's mine, man.

861
00:57:32,320 --> 00:57:34,080
We are sorry.

862
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:37,479
Mr. Omar, but you will be pleased
to know that we had no interest

863
00:57:37,480 --> 00:57:40,079
whatsoever in many many pairs
of bright Underpants.

864
00:57:40,080 --> 00:57:40,960
All right.

865
00:57:40,961 --> 00:57:44,799
Hey, look, I'm not even trying
to hear this yall.

866
00:57:44,800 --> 00:57:47,959
I'm gonna go kill these
motherfuckers myself.

867
00:57:47,960 --> 00:57:49,959
No no.

868
00:57:49,960 --> 00:57:50,160
No, Omar, wait!

869
00:57:51,320 --> 00:57:51,960
Mr. Omar!

870
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:53,960
Okay, highball.

871
00:57:53,961 --> 00:57:57,080
I have a rather urgent phone call to make.
Do you have a number for me?

872
00:57:57,200 --> 00:58:0,159
Sorry boss. It looks like no one up there is
packing a cell phone.

873
00:58:0,160 --> 00:58:1,400
Well, how can that be?

874
00:58:1,720 --> 00:58:2,720
Cavemen.

875
00:58:3,400 --> 00:58:4,959
Did you check the crew?

876
00:58:4,960 --> 00:58:6,199
The crew?

877
00:58:6,200 --> 00:58:7,599
Oh shit!

878
00:58:7,600 --> 00:58:8,080
Curtis, I'm sorry.

879
00:58:8,081 --> 00:58:9,880
What did I tell you about that mouth, highball?

880
00:58:10,080 --> 00:58:11,159
Sorry man.

881
00:58:11,160 --> 00:58:12,599
Wait a minute.

882
00:58:12,600 --> 00:58:17,799
Got it, Jack Russell the
captain just the man.

883
00:58:17,800 --> 00:58:19,879
I need to speak to. Uh, Brick,

884
00:58:19,880 --> 00:58:21,800
I need Randall Anderson at the
CIA.

885
00:58:22,440 --> 00:58:23,599
Um, Try his home number.

886
00:58:23,600 --> 00:58:24,480
You got it.

887
00:58:33,120 --> 00:58:34,120
(Omar screams)

888
00:58:42,120 --> 00:58:44,559
Why has this thing suddenly become so big?

889
00:58:44,560 --> 00:58:46,093
Could you come, please.

890
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:51,480
Sit, sit, sit.

891
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:53,160
I want to talk to you

892
00:58:53,760 --> 00:58:54,680
What about?

893
00:58:54,681 --> 00:58:57,319
About the fact that
we're sitting here conspiring to

894
00:58:57,320 --> 00:58:59,439
destroy everything that we made.

895
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:0,576
I mean, did you spend the last

896
00:59:0,600 --> 00:59:2,479
three years building something
up just so you could tear it down?

897
00:59:2,480 --> 00:59:4,960
Scott, what we've built kills people.

898
00:59:7,040 --> 00:59:9,039
Yeah, very effectively too.

899
00:59:9,040 --> 00:59:10,040
What?

900
00:59:10,320 --> 00:59:10,776
Listen to me.

901
00:59:10,800 --> 00:59:14,479
These insects are the only ones
of their kind.

902
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:17,959
We have an obligation to do whatever we
can to make sure that they do

903
00:59:17,960 --> 00:59:19,239
not become extinct.

904
00:59:19,240 --> 00:59:21,373
You'd rather
we become extinct?

905
00:59:24,600 --> 00:59:25,600
What, so you and Cowboy Jack

906
00:59:25,601 --> 00:59:27,159
are just going to shoot up
the saloon together?

907
00:59:27,160 --> 00:59:29,999
Is that what this is?

908
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,319
God, I can't believe you're
going to make this about us.

909
00:59:32,320 --> 00:59:32,720
Really?

910
00:59:32,721 --> 00:59:33,856
This is not about us.

911
00:59:33,880 --> 00:59:36,479
This is about the survival of
the people on this plane.

912
00:59:36,480 --> 00:59:37,240
They don't -

913
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:38,240
This is about living.

914
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:40,136
Come on, don't you think I've seen

915
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:41,799
the way you two have been
mooning over each other ever

916
00:59:41,800 --> 00:59:42,400
since you came on board.

917
00:59:42,401 --> 00:59:44,479
and now, you're going to
merrily destroy everything.

918
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:46,399
I've worked my entire
fucking career to achieve.

919
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:51,400
I will not allow it!
Get up up up up.

920
00:59:57,800 --> 01:00:0,079
Jack you got a got buddy.

921
01:00:0,080 --> 01:00:2,799
We could have been using at the
killer stays dead by now

922
01:00:2,800 --> 01:00:3,480
He doesn't want them dead.

923
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:24,920
Phillip!

924
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:26,693
Oh yeah, see what happens?

925
01:00:26,840 --> 01:00:28,999
God, why? Why this?

926
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,386
You never gave me equity,
profit share, any control,

927
01:00:31,411 --> 01:00:33,456
you know,

928
01:00:33,480 --> 01:00:34,679
So I cut a deal for myself old
man.

929
01:00:34,680 --> 01:00:35,960
Scott, this is crazy.

930
01:00:37,640 --> 01:00:37,960
Sick bastard.

931
01:00:37,961 --> 01:00:41,680
(mocking) Sick bastard. Hey, we can still be friends, right?

932
01:00:48,960 --> 01:00:51,119
I never wanted this. I'm going to go.

933
01:00:51,120 --> 01:00:52,120
Phillip!

934
01:00:56,600 --> 01:00:57,600
Phillip, no!

935
01:01:4,360 --> 01:01:5,360
Hold on!

936
01:01:8,280 --> 01:01:10,080
Hold on, everybody hold on!

937
01:01:14,800 --> 01:01:16,333
Jennifer, grab my hand!

938
01:01:18,560 --> 01:01:19,560
Help me!

939
01:01:23,520 --> 01:01:25,987
Jennifer, grab my hand. Grab my hand!

940
01:01:27,120 --> 01:01:28,120
I'm slipping!

941
01:01:36,440 --> 01:01:37,840
I can't hold on Jack!

942
01:01:38,200 --> 01:01:39,200
(screaming)

943
01:01:39,520 --> 01:01:41,187
Look at me, just hold on.

944
01:01:58,560 --> 01:01:59,560
Come on!

945
01:02:4,680 --> 01:02:8,813
Pressure should start stabilizing soon. Come on, just hold on!

946
01:02:15,960 --> 01:02:19,919
Wouldn't have been part of my plan, but it seems to have worked.

947
01:02:19,920 --> 01:02:20,920
Phillip,

948
01:02:21,200 --> 01:02:21,856
Oh God, Philip.

949
01:02:23,720 --> 01:02:24,680
I can't believe that guy saved
my life.

950
01:02:27,960 --> 01:02:28,400
So

951
01:02:28,960 --> 01:02:30,400
are all The Nasty
creatures gone?

952
01:02:32,600 --> 01:02:33,600
Is everybody alright?

953
01:02:35,960 --> 01:02:36,320
I'm okay.

954
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:38,520
Shit, Scott.

955
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:42,719
Yeah, shit, Scott. Everybody up!

956
01:02:42,720 --> 01:02:44,456
Get up, we've sitll got a plane to land.

957
01:02:44,480 --> 01:02:46,359
Move it.

958
01:02:46,360 --> 01:02:47,656
Get up! Jesus Christ!

959
01:02:47,680 --> 01:02:48,800
Move, people!

960
01:02:59,400 --> 01:02:59,880
Is this Randall Anderson?

961
01:03:3,080 --> 01:03:4,080
Randall this is Curtis Burch.

962
01:03:4,081 --> 01:03:5,600
I need a favor.

963
01:03:16,880 --> 01:03:18,160
Guess I'm going to have to do this
the hard way.

964
01:03:24,880 --> 01:03:26,599
What's the story, morning glory?

965
01:03:26,600 --> 01:03:28,376
Well these are desperate
by Desperate Measures.

966
01:03:28,400 --> 01:03:29,679
What do you want us to do?

967
01:03:29,680 --> 01:03:32,239
The mother of all Hacks.

968
01:03:32,240 --> 01:03:33,440
What's the target?

969
01:03:34,240 --> 01:03:35,856
The CIA spy satellite control system.

970
01:03:35,880 --> 01:03:36,400
control system.

971
01:03:36,401 --> 01:03:38,879
All right, everyone remain

972
01:03:38,880 --> 01:03:42,460
calm. We're not out of this
shit. right Captain Jack?

973
01:03:43,720 --> 01:03:46,879
Right, but we'd all be able to think a
little more clearly if you just

974
01:03:46,880 --> 01:03:47,600
put the gun down.

975
01:03:47,601 --> 01:03:49,960
Yeah, no chance.

976
01:03:52,680 --> 01:03:54,680
Okay, you're the boss.

977
01:04:2,880 --> 01:04:3,480
Can you land the plane?

978
01:04:5,800 --> 01:04:9,380
I still need to fix the landing
gear wiring in the avionics room.

979
01:04:14,600 --> 01:04:17,000
How long until we reach Los Angeles?

980
01:04:17,280 --> 01:04:18,480
An hour, maybe less

981
01:04:20,080 --> 01:04:21,056
Okay.

982
01:04:21,080 --> 01:04:21,880
Good. Good.

983
01:04:21,881 --> 01:04:24,800
Good you go drive.

984
01:04:27,400 --> 01:04:27,880
Did you not hear me?

985
01:04:27,881 --> 01:04:29,799
I - what part did you miss?

986
01:04:29,800 --> 01:04:34,120
I said that I still need to fix
the landing gear wiring in the avionics room.

987
01:04:34,200 --> 01:04:35,200
Okay.

988
01:04:35,960 --> 01:04:36,576
Cool.

989
01:04:36,600 --> 01:04:39,560
You two go fix the landing
gear.

990
01:04:40,440 --> 01:04:41,440
Jesus.

991
01:04:41,680 --> 01:04:42,600
You crazy asshole.

992
01:04:42,601 --> 01:04:45,599
There's a stack of three ring
binders as high as an

993
01:04:45,600 --> 01:04:47,599
elephant's ass detailing the
wiring schematics.

994
01:04:47,600 --> 01:04:48,480
It's good.

995
01:04:48,480 --> 01:04:49,400
It sounds really complicated.

996
01:04:49,401 --> 01:04:51,960
We can do it we can do it.

997
01:04:54,320 --> 01:04:56,679
Hell, it'd take a damn near rocket
scientist to do it that quick.

998
01:04:56,680 --> 01:04:57,799
I'm no rocket scientist.

999
01:04:57,800 --> 01:04:59,080
We can do it!

1000
01:05:1,800 --> 01:05:6,679
Mr. Jack, I and my brother came
for our Quest To America so

1001
01:05:6,680 --> 01:05:12,239
far. We will fix that landing
gear or we will die trying.

1002
01:05:12,240 --> 01:05:13,240
See?

1003
01:05:16,480 --> 01:05:17,480
All right.

1004
01:05:19,680 --> 01:05:20,600
Looks like you're our only shot.

1005
01:05:20,601 --> 01:05:22,520
Let's see what you guys can do.

1006
01:05:23,120 --> 01:05:25,120
The wiring you're looking for.

1007
01:05:27,960 --> 01:05:30,960
The wire you're looking for, big
gray cables on the aft wall in the avionics room.

1008
01:05:35,400 --> 01:05:35,600
Good luck.

1009
01:05:35,600 --> 01:05:36,320
Jaffe.

1010
01:05:36,320 --> 01:05:36,800
Sedam.

1011
01:05:36,801 --> 01:05:39,879
Looks like we're going to need
a hell of a lot of it.

1012
01:05:39,880 --> 01:05:43,319
Yeah, I'm sure that one of them
can Scamper up here and ask you

1013
01:05:43,320 --> 01:05:44,599
some questions if they got a
fucking problem.

1014
01:05:44,600 --> 01:05:47,319
All right, Saddam Arafat get
your tools.

1015
01:05:47,320 --> 01:05:50,959
I will escort you to avionics.

1016
01:05:50,960 --> 01:05:54,880
Excuse me, sir.

1017
01:05:56,480 --> 01:05:57,320
Mr. Jack is

1018
01:05:57,321 --> 01:06:0,160
right. You are a crazy asshole!

1019
01:06:1,800 --> 01:06:2,080
my tools.

1020
01:06:4,080 --> 01:06:6,400
You have no idea.

1021
01:06:11,080 --> 01:06:13,080
Captain Jack, I'd like for you to remain seated for the remainder of the flight.

1022
01:06:17,680 --> 01:06:20,359
You- Shit!

1023
01:06:20,360 --> 01:06:22,959
Now, you move, move, move, God damn it, move.

1024
01:06:22,960 --> 01:06:24,340
We are doing it, We are doing it.

1025
01:06:27,120 --> 01:06:27,856
Get the fuck down there.

1026
01:06:33,080 --> 01:06:35,680
I think this has been sitting there a while, but
I had a lot of cream sugar.

1027
01:06:41,880 --> 01:06:42,880
Ooh, Wow, well, that's bad.

1028
01:06:42,881 --> 01:06:44,879
I think you missed your
calling.

1029
01:06:44,880 --> 01:06:48,400
Maybe you really should be a flight
attendant.

1030
01:06:51,800 --> 01:06:52,680
This is very complicated.

1031
01:06:52,681 --> 01:06:56,799
If we connect the wrong wire to
the circuit board, we may

1032
01:06:56,800 --> 01:06:58,079
fairly well melt the whole
thing.

1033
01:06:58,080 --> 01:06:59,599
We will do it brother.

1034
01:06:59,600 --> 01:07:0,480
We will do it.

1035
01:07:3,320 --> 01:07:6,319
Yes, it would be a great help
to get captain Jake to guide us

1036
01:07:6,320 --> 01:07:8,879
through this. We want Captain
Jake.

1037
01:07:8,880 --> 01:07:9,856
Well you can't have him.

1038
01:07:9,880 --> 01:07:11,959
All right, you said 'you can do
it.'

1039
01:07:11,960 --> 01:07:12,880
So do it.

1040
01:07:12,881 --> 01:07:15,600
Okay.

1041
01:07:19,680 --> 01:07:22,319
I have an idea, I have an idea.

1042
01:07:22,320 --> 01:07:25,679
You prepare and splice the
wires.

1043
01:07:25,680 --> 01:07:27,159
I will be right back.

1044
01:07:27,160 --> 01:07:28,680
Okay,

1045
01:07:31,080 --> 01:07:31,880
good luck

1046
01:07:32,760 --> 01:07:33,936
Uh, where are you going?

1047
01:07:35,760 --> 01:07:37,660
I'm going this way.

1048
01:07:38,800 --> 01:07:40,320
Good, I'm going to go with you, how is that?

1049
01:07:40,700 --> 01:07:44,600
Good, you will be useful. follow me. Come.

1050
01:07:54,600 --> 01:07:54,960
Hey.

1051
01:07:57,080 --> 01:07:57,800
I found this back there.

1052
01:07:57,801 --> 01:08:1,320
I figured you were probably
dying for a smoke.

1053
01:08:4,960 --> 01:08:5,800
It actually survived all this.

1054
01:08:8,880 --> 01:08:12,400
If we do, well, maybe I'll
think about quitting smoking.

1055
01:08:24,440 --> 01:08:25,907
Hello, Hello, testing.

1056
01:08:27,559 --> 01:08:28,559
Testing, 1 2 3

1057
01:08:30,319 --> 01:08:32,398
Mr. Scott you take this to mr.

1058
01:08:32,399 --> 01:08:33,478
Jack for communication.

1059
01:08:33,479 --> 01:08:36,679
I will help my brother Sedam.

1060
01:08:36,680 --> 01:08:37,576
Yeah, very very good.

1061
01:08:37,600 --> 01:08:38,479
Yeah, you do that you go

1062
01:08:38,479 --> 01:08:38,800
Help Sedam,

1063
01:08:38,800 --> 01:08:40,478
All right? and no funny
business.

1064
01:08:40,479 --> 01:08:41,679
Yes.

1065
01:08:41,680 --> 01:08:41,960
Yes.

1066
01:08:41,960 --> 01:08:43,158
Yes no funny business.

1067
01:08:43,160 --> 01:08:48,799
I know you are a very evil and
scary man now go please go.

1068
01:08:48,800 --> 01:08:52,680
Please please fast, we want
communication.

1069
01:08:56,960 --> 01:08:58,078
I'm sorry about what I said
back there.

1070
01:08:58,080 --> 01:09:2,879
I think it's incredible that
you still hold your wife in

1071
01:09:2,880 --> 01:09:4,158
your heart.

1072
01:09:4,160 --> 01:09:5,080
There's no reason to get rid of
that.

1073
01:09:9,319 --> 01:09:9,880
Thanks for saying that.

1074
01:09:12,319 --> 01:09:13,319
She would have really liked you.

1075
01:09:16,680 --> 01:09:17,680
Thanks.

1076
01:09:18,360 --> 01:09:22,160
So, Here I am again with other
people's lives in my hands.

1077
01:09:24,479 --> 01:09:25,800
And it goes with the job,
doesn't it?

1078
01:09:27,120 --> 01:09:28,120
Right.

1079
01:09:30,639 --> 01:09:31,639
Thanks.

1080
01:09:36,080 --> 01:09:36,800
I'll get us down

1081
01:09:40,559 --> 01:09:41,559
You better.

1082
01:09:52,399 --> 01:09:55,398
No, no no. Sorry to interrupt this Magic Moment,
but I want you focused on landing

1083
01:09:55,400 --> 01:09:58,400
the darn plane.
You yeah, get up! come on.

1084
01:10:0,000 --> 01:10:0,856
It's for you.

1085
01:10:1,680 --> 01:10:2,680
(radio static)

1086
01:10:2,920 --> 01:10:3,920
Captain Jack!

1087
01:10:4,480 --> 01:10:4,960
Sedam?

1088
01:10:5,360 --> 01:10:6,360
Captain Jack.

1089
01:10:7,400 --> 01:10:8,320
Well damnation.

1090
01:10:15,160 --> 01:10:16,080
Scott what is wrong with you?

1091
01:10:17,680 --> 01:10:19,547
What the hell are you doing?

1092
01:10:26,320 --> 01:10:27,320
Are you proud of yourself?

1093
01:10:30,960 --> 01:10:35,079
Well, this certainly is a
magnificent fucking catastrophe

1094
01:10:35,080 --> 01:10:40,160
but very definitely not what I
had in mind.

1095
01:10:42,040 --> 01:10:46,159
What you had in mind? Jesus
Christ you were going to sell

1096
01:10:46,160 --> 01:10:46,800
us all out.

1097
01:10:46,800 --> 01:10:47,880
What can I say?

1098
01:10:51,680 --> 01:10:55,318
What can I say? You and Phillip never
truly appreciated the market

1099
01:10:55,320 --> 01:10:55,680
value of the technology.

1100
01:10:55,681 --> 01:11:0,318
You bastard. People died because
of your greed.

1101
01:11:0,320 --> 01:11:7,599
Ooh, ain't that just too damn
bad. And all for nothing too, seeing

1102
01:11:7,600 --> 01:11:8,600
as all the specimens are gone.

1103
01:11:8,601 --> 01:11:11,439
Thanks to Grandpa.

1104
01:11:11,440 --> 01:11:12,940
Phillip you asshole!

1105
01:11:17,760 --> 01:11:19,493
Ah ah ah ah ah, sit bitch.

1106
01:11:21,680 --> 01:11:23,960
Look at me. Good girl.

1107
01:11:26,200 --> 01:11:27,532
Alright, girlfriend.

1108
01:11:29,120 --> 01:11:31,200
You keep your eyes open.

1109
01:11:32,480 --> 01:11:34,398
If there is one fucking specimen left on

1110
01:11:34,400 --> 01:11:34,600
his plane.

1111
01:11:34,601 --> 01:11:37,600
I am going to have more money
than God

1112
01:11:39,600 --> 01:11:40,320
God don't need money.

1113
01:11:44,240 --> 01:11:45,240
Good, more for me.

1114
01:11:46,480 --> 01:11:47,480
(hatch opens)

1115
01:11:47,920 --> 01:11:48,920
Oh my...

1116
01:11:50,920 --> 01:11:51,920
Jack!

1117
01:11:53,160 --> 01:11:54,160
(screaming)

1118
01:12:5,960 --> 01:12:6,960
Oh, darling.

1119
01:12:9,680 --> 01:12:11,080
Yes sir, that's mine.

1120
01:12:14,160 --> 01:12:18,879
Yeah, The exo skeleton is slightly mutilated, and the left

1121
01:12:18,880 --> 01:12:21,400
pelipad is lopsided little bit.

1122
01:12:21,559 --> 01:12:24,160
But over all i'd say she's damned sexy.

1123
01:12:36,480 --> 01:12:37,947
Jack, are you alright?

1124
01:12:38,680 --> 01:12:39,680
Oh my god.

1125
01:12:41,080 --> 01:12:44,439
I've been better. Jenna, I can't
see.

1126
01:12:44,440 --> 01:12:46,440
Courtney.

1127
01:12:46,960 --> 01:12:50,478
Stay here and help Jack see what
he needs to see, and wrap something

1128
01:12:50,480 --> 01:12:52,398
around his eyes.

1129
01:12:52,400 --> 01:12:53,900
But where are you going?

1130
01:12:54,680 --> 01:12:55,680
Somebody has to kill that thing.

1131
01:13:2,719 --> 01:13:4,587
It's the green motherfucker.

1132
01:13:6,120 --> 01:13:7,920
Captain Jack! Captain Jack!

1133
01:13:10,200 --> 01:13:11,200
Jaffe!

1134
01:13:13,080 --> 01:13:14,080
Jaffe!

1135
01:13:22,440 --> 01:13:23,973
Come on Jaffe. Come on.

1136
01:13:30,160 --> 01:13:31,480
Holy shit.

1137
01:13:31,719 --> 01:13:33,020
Holy shit.

1138
01:13:33,880 --> 01:13:34,880
We're in.

1139
01:13:35,300 --> 01:13:36,700
Holy shit, we're in!, We're in!

1140
01:13:36,760 --> 01:13:37,760
Holy shit!

1141
01:13:38,639 --> 01:13:39,639
Curtis!

1142
01:13:41,120 --> 01:13:41,536
Okay, what have we got?

1143
01:13:41,559 --> 01:13:44,999
Well, apparently we have a CIA
spy satellite.

1144
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:46,000
Holy shit!

1145
01:13:46,160 --> 01:13:47,040
The mouth on this guy.

1146
01:13:47,041 --> 01:13:48,280
Good, good work.

1147
01:13:55,040 --> 01:13:56,040
I'm okay brother

1148
01:13:56,440 --> 01:13:57,440
I'm okay.

1149
01:13:59,960 --> 01:14:1,719
You must finish the job,

1150
01:14:1,719 --> 01:14:2,719
But Jaffe, I-

1151
01:14:3,120 --> 01:14:4,120
But nothing.

1152
01:14:4,559 --> 01:14:7,280
The life of many people on this plane is in our hands.

1153
01:14:9,760 --> 01:14:11,159
Youu have to save them.

1154
01:14:11,160 --> 01:14:12,493
I will try, brother.

1155
01:14:13,280 --> 01:14:14,547
Try hard, try hard.

1156
01:14:15,360 --> 01:14:16,360
Come on, do it!

1157
01:14:18,080 --> 01:14:19,547
(electricity arcing)

1158
01:14:19,719 --> 01:14:20,719
It's beautiful.

1159
01:14:22,639 --> 01:14:23,639
It's beautiful?

1160
01:14:23,760 --> 01:14:24,280
Where did she go?

1161
01:14:25,360 --> 01:14:26,360
That way.

1162
01:14:27,360 --> 01:14:28,040
Are you alright?

1163
01:14:29,360 --> 01:14:30,559
I will live if we land.

1164
01:14:32,320 --> 01:14:35,639
But first we have to kill the
bitch.

1165
01:14:35,639 --> 01:14:36,639
Count on it.

1166
01:14:37,160 --> 01:14:38,255
The fibrillator only

1167
01:14:38,280 --> 01:14:42,679
carries enough power for a
short jolt. Brother in order for

1168
01:14:42,680 --> 01:14:43,360
us to kill the beast,

1169
01:14:43,361 --> 01:14:46,360
We need something, a larger
battery, something-

1170
01:14:46,440 --> 01:14:47,573
A larger battery?

1171
01:14:48,780 --> 01:14:49,780
I've got an idea.

1172
01:14:50,680 --> 01:14:52,480
No, not the old APU sister.

1173
01:14:53,760 --> 01:14:55,199
That much will kill you sister.

1174
01:14:55,200 --> 01:14:56,680
Fix the plane.

1175
01:14:58,080 --> 01:14:59,080
I'll be back.

1176
01:15:0,840 --> 01:15:2,840
Say what you want. That girl got
moxie.

1177
01:15:59,680 --> 01:16:2,639
Captain Jack, Captain Jack, can
you hear me?

1178
01:16:2,639 --> 01:16:3,639
Loud and clear.

1179
01:16:3,960 --> 01:16:7,679
Captain Jack, the primary and
secondary couplings are sliced and bound.

1180
01:16:7,680 --> 01:16:11,680
We are definitely ready to start reconnecting.

1181
01:16:12,680 --> 01:16:14,039
Okay running up
the right side of the Box

1182
01:16:14,040 --> 01:16:16,740
you're gonna see a series of connectors, do you see them?

1183
01:16:17,400 --> 01:16:18,320
Yes, I do.

1184
01:16:18,320 --> 01:16:19,320
Good.

1185
01:16:19,760 --> 01:16:22,639
Captain Jack, there are many connectors, which one?

1186
01:16:22,639 --> 01:16:26,000
I need you to have them wire tested until you find an open line.

1187
01:16:26,639 --> 01:16:27,773
I cannot do this.

1188
01:16:29,280 --> 01:16:30,880
We will do it, brother.

1189
01:16:31,480 --> 01:16:31,680
Thank you Jaffe.

1190
01:16:34,680 --> 01:16:36,478
Satellite is in position
matching speed and trajectory.

1191
01:16:36,480 --> 01:16:37,680
Thank you, brick.

1192
01:16:38,300 --> 01:16:39,200
Operator.

1193
01:16:39,320 --> 01:16:39,559
Yes, sir.

1194
01:16:39,680 --> 01:16:42,039
I'd like to place a
person-to-person call, please.

1195
01:16:42,040 --> 01:16:42,840
Yes, sir.

1196
01:16:45,160 --> 01:16:46,160
What the hell?

1197
01:16:47,040 --> 01:16:47,840
Courtney, grab that.

1198
01:16:48,760 --> 01:16:49,760
It's in my bag.

1199
01:16:52,080 --> 01:16:52,736
Hello?

1200
01:16:52,760 --> 01:16:54,879
Curtis Burnham.

1201
01:16:54,880 --> 01:16:55,335
This is
Courtney.

1202
01:16:56,400 --> 01:16:59,520
Hey, um, we're in a lot of trouble
up here.

1203
01:17:2,559 --> 01:17:3,559
Yeah, yeah, he is.

1204
01:17:3,600 --> 01:17:5,398
Uh, hold on.

1205
01:17:5,400 --> 01:17:6,800
It's for you.

1206
01:17:10,440 --> 01:17:11,360
Hello?

1207
01:17:11,361 --> 01:17:13,240
Who is this angel of mercy?

1208
01:17:14,960 --> 01:17:16,199
Well, what's left of him.

1209
01:17:16,200 --> 01:17:16,719
Who's this?

1210
01:17:19,920 --> 01:17:23,080
Well, I never thought that I'd be
happy getting a call from the FAA.

1211
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:32,880
Okay, Captain.

1212
01:17:32,880 --> 01:17:34,799
I need you to accelerate your
descent.

1213
01:17:34,800 --> 01:17:36,839
You're at about 6,000 feet now.

1214
01:17:36,840 --> 01:17:38,856
Courtney, what's our altimeter reading now?

1215
01:17:39,719 --> 01:17:41,999
Ah, 3,000.

1216
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:45,719
Wait Curtis you're saying
we're at 6,000 feet?

1217
01:17:47,040 --> 01:17:48,398
Damn, it Curtis my altimeter's

1218
01:17:48,400 --> 01:17:50,999
malfunctioning. It says 3,000
feet, so

1219
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:52,880
you're gonna have to call the
ball from here.

1220
01:17:53,440 --> 01:17:54,440
Alright, okay.

1221
01:17:55,240 --> 01:17:55,856
Courtney,

1222
01:17:56,400 --> 01:17:57,867
relay my, my altitude.

1223
01:17:58,800 --> 01:17:59,255
Okay.

1224
01:18:1,080 --> 01:18:2,879
All right, Captain just follow
my lead.

1225
01:18:2,880 --> 01:18:5,478
You're going to need to power
die for short bursts.

1226
01:18:5,480 --> 01:18:7,359
I'll count it off for you.

1227
01:18:7,360 --> 01:18:7,800
Are you ready?

1228
01:18:7,800 --> 01:18:9,799
Everybody grab something and
squeeze it now.

1229
01:18:9,800 --> 01:18:10,800
Now!

1230
01:18:12,400 --> 01:18:13,400
Oh shit!

1231
01:18:15,559 --> 01:18:16,559
(screaming)

1232
01:18:18,320 --> 01:18:19,320
5,000.

1233
01:18:19,360 --> 01:18:20,360
Five-thousand.

1234
01:18:22,639 --> 01:18:23,580
Forty-five hundred.

1235
01:18:23,600 --> 01:18:24,867
Forty-five hundred.

1236
01:18:26,800 --> 01:18:27,335
Four-thousand.

1237
01:18:27,360 --> 01:18:28,080
Four thousand

1238
01:18:30,080 --> 01:18:33,200
Get ready to level off... now!

1239
01:18:42,600 --> 01:18:43,600
Oh god.

1240
01:19:53,600 --> 01:19:54,800
(Scorpion squeals)

1241
01:19:59,760 --> 01:20:0,760
Look at her.

1242
01:20:1,520 --> 01:20:2,200
Isn't she beautiful?

1243
01:20:4,040 --> 01:20:5,040
Hey, babe.

1244
01:20:5,320 --> 01:20:8,080
Guess that's why I'm Not Dead yet.

1245
01:20:8,160 --> 01:20:9,199
Oh, god.

1246
01:20:9,200 --> 01:20:10,200
So apparently,

1247
01:20:11,920 --> 01:20:17,398
through the years of all the minor stings from the scorpions we were using in the lab.

1248
01:20:17,400 --> 01:20:20,067
I've developed an immunity to the venom.

1249
01:20:21,020 --> 01:20:23,893
you know, Not completely, you know, obviously

1250
01:20:26,320 --> 01:20:27,456
I feel a little bit, you know.

1251
01:20:29,160 --> 01:20:30,227
it's like, whew.

1252
01:20:31,559 --> 01:20:32,940
a rush, it's a rush.

1253
01:20:33,080 --> 01:20:33,536
That gun's empty Scott.

1254
01:20:37,800 --> 01:20:38,520
(gun cocks)

1255
01:20:38,521 --> 01:20:39,559
You were saying?

1256
01:20:46,719 --> 01:20:47,719
Dammit.

1257
01:20:49,880 --> 01:20:52,080
Jaffe, Sedam, I need to land
now.

1258
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:54,000
Guys!

1259
01:20:54,200 --> 01:20:56,000
I don't know which connector

1260
01:20:56,840 --> 01:20:57,879
Pick one.

1261
01:20:57,880 --> 01:20:58,200
we have no time.

1262
01:20:58,920 --> 01:21:0,120
But Jaffe, I can't, I-

1263
01:21:0,680 --> 01:21:1,200
You can do it.

1264
01:21:2,160 --> 01:21:4,427
I'm not going to let you hurt her.

1265
01:21:4,960 --> 01:21:6,893
I'm not going to let you undo

1266
01:21:8,200 --> 01:21:9,267
what' I've done.

1267
01:21:11,040 --> 01:21:11,736
She's perfection.

1268
01:21:13,320 --> 01:21:14,719
She's my little girl.

1269
01:21:16,960 --> 01:21:17,960
She's mine.

1270
01:21:20,120 --> 01:21:20,600
You can have her.

1271
01:21:28,680 --> 01:21:29,813
(Scott screaming)

1272
01:21:33,840 --> 01:21:35,255
Jaffe, Sedam, I need to land now!

1273
01:21:37,200 --> 01:21:38,200
Come on, guys.

1274
01:21:45,880 --> 01:21:46,880
Yeah, Allah.

1275
01:21:49,840 --> 01:21:50,840
Do it.

1276
01:22:4,440 --> 01:22:5,919
Courtney, how close are we?

1277
01:22:5,920 --> 01:22:9,719
I see the runway,
and I can see some cars, they look like

1278
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:13,620
toys, it's not like I have
something to compare them to.

1279
01:22:16,200 --> 01:22:18,478
Tell me when we get closer. Are we straight, are we lined up on the runway?

1280
01:22:18,480 --> 01:22:21,318
We're just about straight, we're straight. We're straight.

1281
01:22:21,320 --> 01:22:22,120
Are you sure?

1282
01:22:22,120 --> 01:22:23,120
Yes!

1283
01:22:38,360 --> 01:22:40,440
Three, two, one,

1284
01:22:41,080 --> 01:22:42,080
Now.

1285
01:22:56,360 --> 01:22:57,627
We've done it. Yes.

1286
01:23:17,520 --> 01:23:19,452
Thank you for flying with us.

1287
01:23:22,600 --> 01:23:23,600
We stopped.

1288
01:23:23,760 --> 01:23:26,759
Yeah, means the plane is on the
ground.

1289
01:23:26,760 --> 01:23:28,160
Congratulations.

1290
01:23:31,480 --> 01:23:33,239
Not bad Cowboy.

1291
01:23:33,240 --> 01:23:34,680
Hello, Jennifer

1292
01:23:35,240 --> 01:23:36,240
Is it dead?

1293
01:23:36,520 --> 01:23:37,653
Better than dead.

1294
01:23:37,760 --> 01:23:38,120
Nice work.

1295
01:23:38,121 --> 01:23:41,120
You too.

1296
01:23:41,160 --> 01:23:42,279
Thanks,

1297
01:23:42,280 --> 01:23:44,080
but Courtney did it all.

1298
01:23:44,300 --> 01:23:44,660
Come on, Let's

1299
01:23:44,760 --> 01:23:45,880
get me out of this damn crate.

1300
01:23:47,960 --> 01:23:48,680
Yaffe.

1301
01:23:51,680 --> 01:23:53,580
We are in America.

1302
01:23:57,880 --> 01:23:59,200
Yes. Yes.

1303
01:24:3,440 --> 01:24:4,907
Oh, what's that noise?

1304
01:24:6,200 --> 01:24:6,880
Leonard

1305
01:24:8,719 --> 01:24:9,719
Oh, oh shit.

1306
01:24:9,960 --> 01:24:10,960
Ah!

1307
01:24:11,360 --> 01:24:12,360
Omar?

1308
01:24:15,280 --> 01:24:16,959
You know what, that ain't right,
locking a brother up in that thing for hours.

1309
01:24:16,960 --> 01:24:17,880
We thought you were dead.

1310
01:24:19,559 --> 01:24:20,376
No,

1311
01:24:20,400 --> 01:24:21,478
I went and I was hunting those
things down.

1312
01:24:21,480 --> 01:24:27,679
I had my screwdriver and
I killed like five or six of

1313
01:24:27,680 --> 01:24:28,800
them out there it was crazy!

1314
01:24:31,480 --> 01:24:31,856
How the hell did you get up there?

1315
01:24:36,600 --> 01:24:36,760
I don't know.

1316
01:24:45,480 --> 01:24:46,480
Better get you to a hospital.

1317
01:24:47,360 --> 01:24:48,493
Ah, I'll be fine.

1318
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:53,920
Let's say me and you, ditch this
plane, and we go get a place.

1319
01:24:54,800 --> 01:24:56,100
You know, I know Tantra.

1320
01:24:56,639 --> 01:24:57,639
I know Karate.

1321
01:25:2,960 --> 01:25:6,693
Well, in that case, I bet you're dying for one of these.

1322
01:25:13,960 --> 01:25:14,960
I just quit.

1323
01:25:15,600 --> 01:25:16,520
Really?

1324
01:25:16,521 --> 01:25:19,040
Yeah, I finally got a reason to.

1325
01:25:35,719 --> 01:25:38,420
Come on, let's go cowboy.
