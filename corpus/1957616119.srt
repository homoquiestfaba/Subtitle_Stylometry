00:02:41,553 --> 00:02:42,977
Go to my office and review it.

looks great.

00:02:43,831 --> 00:02:44,812
JULIA:
Doesn't it?

34
00:02:44,907 --> 00:02:45,998
Did a really nice job...

Be out in a sec.

36
00:02:50,396 --> 00:02:52,062
LIZBETH: Hey

37
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,839
Can I help you?

38
00:02:55,734 --> 00:02:59,327
Joan, can you bring
us an ice pack?

39
00:02:59,421 --> 00:03:00,179
Why don't we go sit down?

40
00:03:01,757 --> 00:03:03,015
Right through here.

41
00:03:03,742 --> 00:03:04,183
Yeah...

42
00:03:06,687 --> 00:03:08,428
LIZBETH: We have a nurse
here at the shelter.

43
00:03:08,522 --> 00:03:09,429
Would you like to see her?

44
00:03:10,006 --> 00:03:11,440
SOPHIE: No,
no, I'm fine.

45
00:03:13,602 --> 00:03:15,152
LIZBETH: You can file a police
report against whoever did this.

46
00:03:17,013 --> 00:03:18,030
SOPHIE: I don't want to
make him any angrier.

47
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:20,824

Who's he?

48

like us to help you?

00:03:32,696 --> 00:03:34,129
We have room if you
want to come stay.

51
00:03:38,627 --> 00:03:40,961
SOPHIE: You know what, I
don't really know why I came.

52
00:03:41,113 --> 00:03:43,222
I think I should go.

53
00:03:44,725 --> 00:03:46,132
LIZBETH:
No. Keep it.

54
00:03:46,227 --> 00:03:47,226
We're always here.

55
00:03:49,063 --> 00:03:50,729
You didn't do anything to
deserve what happened to you.

56
00:04:01,725 --> 00:04:02,724
JULIA: Hopefully
she'll come back.

57
00:04:02,818 --> 00:04:03,800
LIZBETH: Yeah
I hope so.

58
00:04:03,819 --> 00:04:05,135
I didn't even get her name.

59
00:04:05,228 --> 00:04:06,370
JULIA: Neither did I the
first time you came in.

60
00:04:11,752 --> 00:04:13,977
GREG: There you go, just
the way you like it.

you remembered.

00:04:16,423 --> 00:04:18,406

is everything?

The girls are so lovely.

64
00:04:21,095 --> 00:04:23,578
GREG: Cool, cool. Girls!

65
00:04:23,672 --> 00:04:24,821
I'll see you on Sunday.

66
00:04:25,081 --> 00:04:26,223
Okay. Be good!

67
00:04:29,678 --> 00:04:31,103
LIZBETH: What are
you doing here Greg?

68
00:04:31,254 --> 00:04:33,105
GREG: What does
it look like?

69
00:04:33,332 --> 00:04:34,998
LIZBETH: This isn't
your time to see them.

70
00:04:35,017 --> 00:04:39,611
GREG: Okay, so it's
uh, five o'clock,

71
00:04:39,763 --> 00:04:42,781
that means in nineteen
hours, no more court order.

72
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:45,525
Now when I want
to see my kids...

73
00:04:45,677 --> 00:04:46,693
I will.

74
00:04:46,845 --> 00:04:47,953
LIZBETH: There's
still a schedule -

75
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:49,846
GREG: Don't tell me
what to do Lizbeth.

76
00:04:49,865 --> 00:04:52,940
They're my blood.

77
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,293
Never forget that.

78
00:04:55,629 --> 00:04:56,944
MEREDITH: Mommy!

79
00:04:56,964 --> 00:04:59,039
LIZBETH:
Hey you two.

80
00:04:59,191 --> 00:05:00,465
You ready to go home?

81
00:05:00,692 --> 00:05:01,616
Come on, lets go...

82
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:02,467
Wave good-bye to your daddy.

83
00:05:02,619 --> 00:05:03,543
GREG: Bye-bye.

84
00:05:03,637 --> 00:05:04,594
MEREDITH & MARIANTHI:
Bye!

00:05:24,641 --> 00:05:26,325
ANN: You can dress them
in these tiny outfits,

86
00:05:26,476 --> 00:05:28,493
and this one, even has a dog.

87
00:05:29,738 --> 00:05:30,829
LIZBETH: What do
you girls say?

88
00:05:31,056 --> 00:05:32,480
MEREDITH & MARIANTHI:
Thank you!

89
00:05:32,499 --> 00:05:34,224
ANN: You are so
very welcome.

90
00:05:34,317 --> 00:05:35,000
MARIANTHI: Come on
we can go share.

91
00:05:37,004 --> 00:05:38,912
LIZBETH: You, know, you don't
have to bring them something

92
00:05:39,064 --> 00:05:40,397
every time you come.

93
00:05:40,415 --> 00:05:43,400
ANN: I know, but I like
being the fun aunt,

94
00:05:43,418 --> 00:05:45,177
even if we're not
officially sisters.

95
00:05:45,404 --> 00:05:46,178
Cheers.

96
00:05:47,514 --> 00:05:50,164
Speaking of fun...

97
00:05:50,258 --> 00:05:54,244
Michael has hired a new
paralegal and he's really nice.

98
00:05:54,262 --> 00:05:58,748
We could keep it under
wraps, a dinner maybe,

99
00:05:58,842 --> 00:06:00,859
with me and Michael
at our place?

100
00:06:02,512 --> 00:06:04,437
LIZBETH: And
then what?

101
00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:06,323
Are you going to let us date
in secret at your place too?

102
00:06:07,534 --> 00:06:09,350
Because Greg will find out.

103
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:10,869
And I can't afford to have
my tires slashed again.

104
00:06:12,764 --> 00:06:15,123
ANN: I just wish I could find
someone who would protect you.

105
00:06:16,602 --> 00:06:17,283
LIZBETH: Well, that's what
I thought Greg was gonna

106
00:06:17,378 --> 00:06:19,026
do and look where we are.

107
00:06:19,121 --> 00:06:20,270
ANN: Greg could
have fooled anyone.

108
00:06:20,288 --> 00:06:22,956
LIZBETH: I know,
I know. He still does.

109
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:27,052
And he was just docked
for child support and his

110
00:06:27,203 --> 00:06:30,630
supervised visits are over, so
I do not want to poke the bear.

111
00:06:31,967 --> 00:06:34,467
ANN: Well if he doesn't play by
the rules Michael will take it

112
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:36,895
to the judge and he
won't get any visitation.

113
00:06:38,882 --> 00:06:40,565
LIZBETH: See, I don't
need another man.

114
00:06:40,792 --> 00:06:42,567
I have you and your
husband to look out for me.

115
00:06:44,796 --> 00:06:46,071
ANN: Cheers.

116
00:06:47,574 --> 00:06:49,482
LIZBETH: Okay you
two, it is late.

117
00:06:50,226 --> 00:06:52,302
MEREDITH: At daddy's he
doesn't put us to bed,

118
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:53,970
so we can stay up
as long as we want.

119
00:06:54,063 --> 00:06:55,488
LIZBETH: Well, that
sounds like fun,

120
00:06:55,641 --> 00:06:57,565
but if you stay go to bed late
every night then you won't

121
00:06:57,584 --> 00:06:59,084
have any energy to play,
and I know you want

122
00:06:59,235 --> 00:07:00,210
to have fun with your new dolls.

123
00:07:03,832 --> 00:07:05,239
LIZBETH: I love
you my brave girls.

124
00:07:05,333 --> 00:07:06,240
MEREDITH: I
love you mommy.

125
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:07,408
MARIANTHI: I
love you too.

126
00:07:07,502 --> 00:07:08,427
LIZBETH:
Goodnight.

127
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:10,262
Ok...

130
00:07:35,347 --> 00:07:36,371

FONTINA: There are my
beautiful girls!

132
00:07:47,116 --> 00:07:48,717
Ah, what's this?

133
00:07:49,953 --> 00:07:50,802
You let them bring
toys to church?

134
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:53,889
LIZBETH: Mer' honey can
you put it in your pocket.

135
00:07:55,309 --> 00:07:57,217
FONTINA: I think you need
godmother FONTINA to teach

136
00:07:57,369 --> 00:07:58,477
you some manners hm?

137
00:08:00,314 --> 00:08:02,272
So one day a nice Greek boy
like your father will marry you.

138
00:08:03,391 --> 00:08:04,465
LIZBETH: FONTINA.

139
00:08:04,876 --> 00:08:08,394
GREG: Gotcha!
[girls giggle]

140
00:08:08,489 --> 00:08:11,781
GREG: Look at this face huh?
Like a Greek princess.

141
00:08:12,884 --> 00:08:13,883
So what do you say?

142
00:08:13,977 --> 00:08:15,327
Shall we live in
a palace one day?

143
00:08:15,887 --> 00:08:17,162
Alright.

144
00:08:17,389 --> 00:08:19,915
Well only a few hours
until it's daddy time.

145
00:08:22,227 --> 00:08:23,059
MEREDITH & MARIANTHI:
Nai Bampa.

146
00:08:23,078 --> 00:08:24,151
GREG:
Okay.

147
00:08:24,246 --> 00:08:26,004
LIZBETH: Come
on. Let's go.

148
00:08:44,173 --> 00:08:45,524
LIZBETH: Lets
just... okay.

149
00:08:45,675 --> 00:08:46,983
[knocking]

150
00:08:51,273 --> 00:08:52,179
GREG: Are
they ready?

151
00:08:52,274 --> 00:08:53,089
LIZBETH: Yeah.
Of course.

152
00:08:53,108 --> 00:08:55,200
Girls! Get
your bags.

153
00:08:57,612 --> 00:08:59,704
Why is Fontina's
son driving you?

154
00:09:00,356 --> 00:09:02,432
GREG: Why is that
your business?

155
00:09:03,026 --> 00:09:04,292
MARIANTHI, Meredith, let's go!

156
00:09:09,883 --> 00:09:11,457
MEREDITH: Mommy will you pick
us up from daycare tomorrow?

157
00:09:12,553 --> 00:09:14,535
LIZBETH: Not tomorrow but the
day after tomorrow. Okay?

158
00:09:15,130 --> 00:09:16,221
But you can always call me.

159
00:09:16,372 --> 00:09:17,964
GREG: Ahh... They
won't be calling.

160
00:09:18,058 --> 00:09:19,391
They're with me!

161
00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:21,876
LIZBETH: Have fun!

162
00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:22,710
MARIANTHI: Bye!

163
00:09:22,729 --> 00:09:23,878
MEREDITH: Bye.

164
00:09:23,897 --> 00:09:24,896
LIZBETH: Love you!

165
00:09:40,581 --> 00:09:43,540
JULIA: Hey. Greg

166
00:09:44,734 --> 00:09:45,917
Unsupervised?

167
00:09:46,587 --> 00:09:47,811
LIZBETH: Yeah.

168
00:09:48,313 --> 00:09:49,588
They lifted the
visitation restriction.

169
00:09:51,258 --> 00:09:52,757
I just wish I could have
them all the time, you know.

170
00:09:54,336 --> 00:09:55,576
You should have seen
his performance

171
00:09:55,670 --> 00:09:57,153
at church the other day.

172
00:09:57,172 --> 00:09:59,097
Like he was the best
father in the world.

173
00:10:00,267 --> 00:10:01,841
JULIA: I get you want to keep
the girls connected to their

174
00:10:01,935 --> 00:10:07,105
heritage but it's not yours,
you don't have to keep going.

175
00:10:09,276 --> 00:10:13,111
Look, why don't you come
over to my place for dinner.

176
00:10:13,262 --> 00:10:14,738
We can talk about
anything but Greg.

177
00:10:17,117 --> 00:10:18,265
LIZBETH: Thanks Julia.

178
00:10:18,285 --> 00:10:19,600
But I just-I need to
get home just in

179
00:10:19,694 --> 00:10:20,785
case he lets the girls call.

180
00:10:21,788 --> 00:10:23,121
JULIA: Alright.

181
00:10:23,272 --> 00:10:25,790
But I'm around if
you need anything.

182
00:10:27,294 --> 00:10:28,543
You got this.

183
00:10:37,028 --> 00:10:38,637
[beeping]

184
00:11:03,997 --> 00:11:11,997
[melancholy piano music]

185
00:11:18,178 --> 00:11:20,136
<i>-This is Greg Diakos,
leave me a message.</i>

186
00:11:32,918 --> 00:11:35,084
LIZBETH: Hey Janet, I know
I'm here early but ah,

187
00:11:35,178 --> 00:11:36,436
can I just go grab the girls?

188
00:11:36,771 --> 00:11:38,179
JANET: They're
not here.

189
00:11:38,198 --> 00:11:39,513
LIZBETH: What?

190
00:11:39,533 --> 00:11:41,015
JANET: They weren't
dropped off again today.

191
00:11:41,034 --> 00:11:42,367
I assumed they were home sick.

192
00:11:43,278 --> 00:11:44,202
LIZBETH: No,
they're not.

193
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:54,039
[dramatic music]

194
00:12:19,130 --> 00:12:20,980
POLICE OFFICER: Is there any
chance he took the kids out?

195
00:12:21,132 --> 00:12:22,148
Lost track of time?

196
00:12:22,242 --> 00:12:23,575
LIZBETH: No. No.

197
00:12:23,726 --> 00:12:25,818
We have a very strict custody
agreement because

198
00:12:25,912 --> 00:12:27,487
Greg could be violent.

199
00:12:27,639 --> 00:12:29,080
Look up his record.

200
00:12:29,232 --> 00:12:30,749
You'll see all the restraining
orders against him.

201
00:12:32,477 --> 00:12:33,993
POLICE OFFICER: Have you tried
contacting any of his friends?

202
00:12:34,145 --> 00:12:35,420
Family?

203
00:12:35,647 --> 00:12:36,329
LIZBETH: His family's in
Greece and his friends

204
00:12:36,423 --> 00:12:37,647
wouldn't tell me anything.

205
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:38,923
POLICE OFFICER:
Okay.

206
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:39,999
Do you mind if I
make a quick call?

207
00:12:40,485 --> 00:12:42,594
LIZBETH:
Please. Yeah.

208
00:12:42,821 --> 00:12:43,720
POLICE OFFICER: I may
know someone who can help.

209
00:12:45,991 --> 00:12:46,723
POLICE OFFICER: It's a
small community up here.

210
00:12:48,602 --> 00:12:50,584
POLICE OFFICER:
Hey, it's Peter.

211
00:12:50,604 --> 00:12:53,179
I'm trying to locate
a Greg Diakos.

212
00:12:53,273 --> 00:12:54,105
You know him?

213
00:12:56,610 --> 00:13:00,111
Okay, okay thanks.

214
00:13:04,676 --> 00:13:08,269
It's not yet confirmed but
the word is, is that uh,

215
00:13:08,288 --> 00:13:09,529
he left town.

216
00:13:09,623 --> 00:13:10,622
With your girls.

217
00:13:12,626 --> 00:13:14,700
LIZBETH: Wha -Where?
Where did he go?

218
00:13:15,353 --> 00:13:17,520
POLICE OFFICER: I-I don't
know, but I'll go by his house.

219
00:13:17,539 --> 00:13:19,446
If he's not there I'll make
sure that the report goes

220
00:13:19,541 --> 00:13:20,465
through the appropriate unit.

221
00:13:21,876 --> 00:13:23,301
LIZBETH: What
unit is that?

222
00:13:23,452 --> 00:13:24,552
POLICE OFFICER: Crimes
against children.

223
00:13:25,530 --> 00:13:27,864
Don't-don't worry okay.

224
00:13:27,882 --> 00:13:28,807
They're gonna get to
the bottom of this.

225
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:31,226
LIZBETH: Okay.

226
00:13:44,566 --> 00:13:46,783
CHERYL: Lizbeth!
Lizbeth!

227
00:13:48,403 --> 00:13:52,055
CHERYL: Hey. Hey!

228
00:13:52,073 --> 00:13:53,406
Get those elbows off the table!

229
00:13:54,392 --> 00:13:55,583
I dunno how many times
I have to tell you?!

230
00:13:59,064 --> 00:14:00,255
LIAM: Ma'am?

231
00:14:02,158 --> 00:14:03,842
If you don't stop hurting us,
we can't live with you anymore.

232
00:14:05,570 --> 00:14:07,011
CHERYL: Is that so?

233
00:14:11,518 --> 00:14:13,852
Well, there he is.

234
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:16,746
Why don't you make
yourself useful Kova,

235
00:14:16,839 --> 00:14:17,939
and teach your step
kids some manners.

236
00:14:19,508 --> 00:14:20,692
Even your own daughter
doesn't have any.

237
00:14:38,879 --> 00:14:39,794
[car trunk slams]

238
00:14:45,034 --> 00:14:46,200
CHERYL: Wave bye-bye
to your brother.

239
00:14:47,203 --> 00:14:48,961
It's the last time you'll
see'm cause I found us a

240
00:14:49,114 --> 00:14:50,722
new daddy who's gonna
take good care of us.

241
00:15:09,984 --> 00:15:10,909
LIZBETH: Okay,
thank you.

242
00:15:12,728 --> 00:15:14,829
Detective Spring?
I'm Lizbeth Meredith.

243
00:15:16,658 --> 00:15:18,808
My children were
kidnapped by their father,

244
00:15:18,826 --> 00:15:20,585
Gregory Diakos and I was
told the report would

245
00:15:20,736 --> 00:15:21,419
go to your department.

246
00:15:31,156 --> 00:15:32,321
DETECTIVE SPRING: There's
not that much we can do

247
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:34,057
without proof that he's
actually left town.

248
00:15:36,494 --> 00:15:39,996
LIZBETH: Then track his license
plate, or call the airports-

249
00:15:40,014 --> 00:15:40,921
DETECTIVE SPRING:
Ms. Meredith, We don't have

250
00:15:40,941 --> 00:15:42,515
those types of resources.

251
00:15:42,609 --> 00:15:45,276
My instincts are telling me
he'll be back in a day or two.

252
00:15:49,432 --> 00:15:50,506
LIZBETH: Do you know
how many times I've called

253
00:15:50,599 --> 00:15:52,533
the police because of him
detective?

254
00:15:53,119 --> 00:15:54,077
Five.

255
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:56,454
And those weren't even
for the times he beat

256
00:15:56,605 --> 00:15:57,121
me so badly he almost killed me.

257
00:15:58,700 --> 00:15:59,865
They were to file restraining
orders against him and

258
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,960
he is still looking for
ways to punish me.

259
00:16:02,187 --> 00:16:04,353
So my instincts are
telling me that no,

260
00:16:04,372 --> 00:16:06,881
he won't be back
in a day or two.

261
00:16:08,376 --> 00:16:09,801
Please, will you help me?

262
00:16:10,453 --> 00:16:11,711
DETECTIVE SPRING:
I'm sorry.

263
00:16:11,805 --> 00:16:12,862
I can't get a warrant for
his arrest without proof

264
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,305
of where he is.

265
00:16:14,975 --> 00:16:17,033
LIZBETH: Ah, so that's
just-that's it?

266
00:16:17,126 --> 00:16:18,810
You won't even
report them missing?

267
00:16:19,370 --> 00:16:20,870
DETECTIVE SPRING: Not
without a warrant.

268
00:16:20,963 --> 00:16:22,146
But I'll make some calls.

269
00:16:22,724 --> 00:16:23,648
I'll keep you posted.

270
00:16:24,559 --> 00:16:27,543
[phone ringing]

271
00:16:27,562 --> 00:16:28,778
LIZBETH: Look,
I-I don't-

272
00:16:29,881 --> 00:16:32,139
DETECTIVE SPRING:
Detective Spring.

273
00:16:32,233 --> 00:16:34,075
Oh, yes thank you for calling.

274
00:16:35,386 --> 00:16:36,661
Yeah... I do I have
it right here.

275
00:16:39,315 --> 00:16:40,331
FONTINA: Just leave these
in the back of the church.

276
00:16:43,578 --> 00:16:45,061
LIZBETH: Where
is he FONTINA?

277
00:16:45,338 --> 00:16:46,579
FONTINA: Lizbeth.

278
00:16:46,673 --> 00:16:49,173
LIZBETH: Your son drove
Greg to pick up my girls.

279
00:16:49,325 --> 00:16:50,491
Where did he take them?

280
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:51,584
FONTINA: What are
you talking about?

281
00:16:51,736 --> 00:16:53,845
LIZBETH: He's
taken my children!

282
00:16:55,073 --> 00:16:57,348
My God, my God FONTINA
you are a mother -

283
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:59,408
FONTINA: And
he's their father.

284
00:16:59,502 --> 00:17:01,686
It doesn't feel so good to be
without your children, does it?

285
00:17:03,672 --> 00:17:05,523
LIZBETH: Can't you see
what kind of man he is?

286
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:08,675
FONTINA: What I see is
those girls need family.

287
00:17:08,695 --> 00:17:10,586
A proper family.

288
00:17:10,679 --> 00:17:12,196
Like the one they
have in Greece.

289
00:17:21,266 --> 00:17:22,040
LIZBETH: No.

290
00:17:26,621 --> 00:17:28,195
ANN: Why would
he take them?

291
00:17:28,214 --> 00:17:29,605
He didn't even show up for
visitation half the time.

292
00:17:29,624 --> 00:17:31,791
LIZBETH: You know why,
it's to punish me.

293
00:17:31,885 --> 00:17:33,217
It's what he does.

294
00:17:33,444 --> 00:17:35,111
Everything he does is to
punish me for leaving him.

295
00:17:35,613 --> 00:17:36,721
MICHAEL: Lizbeth you
can't just go to Greece

296
00:17:36,872 --> 00:17:38,723
and take your daughters back.

297
00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:41,708
LIZBETH: Why not? Michael,
he kidnapped my kids!

298
00:17:41,803 --> 00:17:45,229
And without proof that
detective won't get a warrant,

299
00:17:45,381 --> 00:17:47,623
won't even put my girls
in the missing database.

300
00:17:48,068 --> 00:17:50,050
MICHAEL: I understand your
frustration but the laws are

301
00:17:50,144 --> 00:17:51,294
different over there,
and they're more

302
00:17:51,387 --> 00:17:53,071
likely to protect the man.

303
00:17:53,222 --> 00:17:55,323
You gotta follow
protocol on this.

304
00:17:56,392 --> 00:17:57,909
ANN: He's
right Lizbeth.

305
00:17:58,136 --> 00:17:59,059
MICHAEL: There is also the
fact that Greece just

306
00:17:59,079 --> 00:18:00,820
entered into the
Hague Convention.

307
00:18:00,972 --> 00:18:03,897
Which means that they must
respect the custody agreements

308
00:18:03,917 --> 00:18:06,250
of the countries from where
the children were taken.

309
00:18:06,402 --> 00:18:07,660
LIZBETH: Okay.

310
00:18:07,754 --> 00:18:08,920
MICHAEL: But only if
you don't break the law.

311
00:18:12,408 --> 00:18:14,834
LIZBETH: Okay,
I get-I get it.

312
00:18:14,986 --> 00:18:20,247
I- I can't just sit around and
wait for protocol on this.

313
00:18:20,266 --> 00:18:21,557
Someone has the proof I need.

314
00:18:22,602 --> 00:18:23,768
I need to find it.

315
00:18:35,356 --> 00:18:37,281
LIZBETH: I'm-I'm
hoping you can help me.

316
00:18:38,601 --> 00:18:41,677
My ex-husband took my daughters
and flew out of Anchorage,

317
00:18:41,696 --> 00:18:44,363
and I'm wondering if maybe he
booked their travel through you?

318
00:18:44,515 --> 00:18:47,199
Maybe you have travel
documents or an itinerary-

319
00:18:47,293 --> 00:18:49,627
LYNN: I'm sorry but we can't
disclose any client information.

320
00:18:50,779 --> 00:18:52,779
LIZBETH: No I-I
understand that,

321
00:18:52,874 --> 00:18:56,801
but he kidnapped my girls and I
need to prove that he left the

322
00:18:56,952 --> 00:18:58,803
country so there's anything
you can do to help me-

323
00:18:59,530 --> 00:19:00,863
LYNN: I'm so sorry, I
had no idea that

324
00:19:00,956 --> 00:19:02,431
Greg would do
anything like this.

325
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:06,535
LIZBETH: I'm s
-do you know him?

326
00:19:06,554 --> 00:19:09,388
LYNN: We dated
for a while. Not now.

327
00:19:09,482 --> 00:19:12,299
But he asked me to book him
one-way tickets to Athens

328
00:19:12,318 --> 00:19:15,111
for him and his-
for your daughters.

329
00:19:16,656 --> 00:19:18,731
I didn't think anything of it
at the time but then I read

330
00:19:18,825 --> 00:19:21,117
your story in the paper
and so I called the police.

331
00:19:22,887 --> 00:19:24,069
LIZBETH: I'm sor-The
police know about this?

332
00:19:24,164 --> 00:19:26,906
LYNN: Yes.

333
00:19:27,575 --> 00:19:29,816
I left a message for the
Detective on the case,

334
00:19:29,836 --> 00:19:32,336
and I told her that Greg
had flown to Greece.

335
00:19:32,563 --> 00:19:33,838
She-wait...

336
00:19:41,422 --> 00:19:42,638
this
is the itinerary.

337
00:19:44,425 --> 00:19:46,350
LIZBETH: Thank
you for this.

338
00:19:48,413 --> 00:19:56,413
[suspenseful music]

339
00:19:57,012 --> 00:19:59,438
LIZBETH: Here. In case the
call from the travel agency

340
00:19:59,590 --> 00:20:00,615
wasn't proof enough.

341
00:20:02,851 --> 00:20:04,035
Why would you ignore this?

342
00:20:08,691 --> 00:20:10,766
DETECTIVE SPRING: Your ex
-husband was concerned

343
00:20:10,785 --> 00:20:12,043
about your mental state.

344
00:20:14,547 --> 00:20:16,196
LIZBETH: You
spoke to him?

345
00:20:16,216 --> 00:20:18,198
DETECTIVE SPRING:
He came to see me.

346
00:20:18,218 --> 00:20:20,509
And I was sure his
concerns were legitimate.

347
00:20:22,705 --> 00:20:25,890
LIZBETH: Yeah. He is a
masterful liar.

348
00:20:28,619 --> 00:20:30,394
Look, you're not the first
person he's fooled and

349
00:20:30,546 --> 00:20:34,473
you won't be the last. But we
need to get that arrest warrant

350
00:20:34,625 --> 00:20:36,234
and we need to make sure that
my girls are entered into the

351
00:20:36,461 --> 00:20:39,403
FBI's NCIC database and
it needs to happen now.

352
00:20:43,317 --> 00:20:44,158
DETECTIVE
SPRING: Okay.

353
00:20:50,658 --> 00:20:52,658
LIZBETH: Yes, well I am
trying to work with my local

354
00:20:52,752 --> 00:20:55,811
authorities but I need help
finding my girls which is why

355
00:20:55,830 --> 00:20:56,921
I'm calling the
state department...

356
00:20:59,817 --> 00:21:02,001
No I don't have a lawyer,
do you know where

357
00:21:02,095 --> 00:21:05,054
I could find one who
understands Greek law?

358
00:21:07,325 --> 00:21:11,185
The phone book... that's
very helpful thank you.

359
00:21:13,998 --> 00:21:15,606
Oh my god...

360
00:21:20,187 --> 00:21:21,612
LIZBETH: Okay...
Come on...

361
00:21:46,455 --> 00:21:48,121
LIZBETH: Julia?
Hey, it's Lizbeth.

362
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,957
Do you know if Bev
Cutler is still on the

363
00:21:51,052 --> 00:21:52,601
board of directors of the AWAIC?

364
00:21:55,464 --> 00:21:57,148
Do you think she could
connect me to her father?

365
00:21:59,134 --> 00:22:02,153
Yeah, yeah I know he's
President Clinton's lawyer.

366
00:22:05,491 --> 00:22:07,566
LLOYD CUTLER:
Ms. Meredith? Lloyd Cutler.

367
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:09,385
My daughter Bev is a great
admirer of what you've done

368
00:22:09,478 --> 00:22:12,312
with the AWAIC, and-and so am I.

369
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:13,998
LIZBETH:
Thank you.

370
00:22:14,149 --> 00:22:15,499
LLOYD CUTLER:
Please, have a seat.

371
00:22:17,562 --> 00:22:20,821
I've been reviewing your
case and to be frank,

372
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:23,065
getting your daughters
back won't be easy.

373
00:22:23,084 --> 00:22:24,991
Greece is its own
country and consequently,

374
00:22:25,086 --> 00:22:26,585
we have limited power there.

375
00:22:27,013 --> 00:22:28,679
LIZBETH: What about
the Hague convention?

376
00:22:28,906 --> 00:22:29,680
LLOYD CUTLER: Well,
they may have signed it

377
00:22:29,832 --> 00:22:31,574
but it's up to them to honor it.

378
00:22:31,592 --> 00:22:33,834
And if they don't then
you'll be fighting

379
00:22:33,928 --> 00:22:35,603
in their judicial system.

380
00:22:37,748 --> 00:22:40,173
What you need is a Greek
lawyer living in Greece.

381
00:22:40,193 --> 00:22:41,433
I'll get in touch with
a colleague of mine

382
00:22:41,527 --> 00:22:42,935
in Thessaloniki.

383
00:22:43,029 --> 00:22:44,436
He's an old hand at dealing
with cases like yours.

384
00:22:44,939 --> 00:22:47,106
LIZBETH: Does that mean
he's been successful?

385
00:22:47,258 --> 00:22:49,033
LLOYD CUTLER: I think you
should prepare yourself

386
00:22:49,184 --> 00:22:50,776
for the battle ahead.

387
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:53,112
I've had more than my fair
share of conversations with

388
00:22:53,264 --> 00:22:54,597
mothers and fathers,
who have spent years

389
00:22:54,690 --> 00:22:57,357
trying to get their
children back.

390
00:22:57,377 --> 00:22:58,501
Despite the Hague.

391
00:23:00,362 --> 00:23:03,214
LIZBETH: Well, I'm ready,
I'll do whatever it takes.

392
00:23:04,609 --> 00:23:11,389
[music]

393
00:23:14,135 --> 00:23:15,851
LIZBETH: [sighs]
Great...

394
00:23:41,587 --> 00:23:49,587
[phone ringing]

395
00:23:51,097 --> 00:23:52,763
LIZBETH: Hello?

396
00:23:52,915 --> 00:23:53,656
<i>HECTOR: Ms. Meredith
this is Hector Papadakis</i>

397
00:23:53,674 --> 00:23:55,081
<i>in Thessaloniki.</i>

398
00:23:55,176 --> 00:23:56,675
<i>I was asked to take your case by</i>

399
00:23:56,827 --> 00:23:58,177
<i>President Clinton's
lawyer, Mr. Cutler.</i>

400
00:23:58,271 --> 00:24:01,755
LIZBETH: Yes, hi, thank
you so much for calling.

401
00:24:01,849 --> 00:24:03,015
Do you have any news?

402
00:24:03,109 --> 00:24:04,850
<i>HECTOR: I do.</i>

403
00:24:04,944 --> 00:24:06,685
<i>The courts in Greece have
ruled to recognize and enforce</i>

404
00:24:06,837 --> 00:24:08,595
<i>your American Custody Order.</i>

405
00:24:08,614 --> 00:24:10,355
LIZBETH: That's
amazing news.

406
00:24:10,508 --> 00:24:14,785
Ah, wow um, okay I-I can
be there in a few of days.

407
00:24:15,012 --> 00:24:16,102
<i>HECTOR: No. It is not
necessary to come until</i>

408
00:24:16,122 --> 00:24:17,863
<i>we find your girls.</i>

409
00:24:18,015 --> 00:24:19,364
<i>I will call again
when I know more.</i>

410
00:24:19,517 --> 00:24:20,866
<i>Adio.</i>

411
00:24:21,018 --> 00:24:23,294
LIZBETH: Wha-how will you
find them though-hello?

412
00:24:27,467 --> 00:24:28,782
ANN: You sure
about this?

413
00:24:28,876 --> 00:24:30,709
LIZBETH: I'm
their mother Ann.

414
00:24:30,803 --> 00:24:33,712
I should be there lighting a
fire under whoever can help me

415
00:24:33,806 --> 00:24:38,701
find them. I know what it feels
like to be unwanted and it

416
00:24:38,794 --> 00:24:41,294
would kill me if they thought
even for a second

417
00:24:41,388 --> 00:24:43,230
that I wasn't doing everything
I could to help them.

418
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:45,966
ANN: Here.

419
00:24:46,060 --> 00:24:47,226
I don't want you
sleeping on the streets.

420
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:48,301
LIZBETH: Ann -

421
00:24:48,395 --> 00:24:49,636
ANN: No. I don't
wanna hear it.

422
00:24:49,655 --> 00:24:50,804
You have probably maxed
out everything you

423
00:24:50,898 --> 00:24:52,490
have just to get there.

424
00:24:52,717 --> 00:24:53,882
And I want to help.

425
00:24:53,901 --> 00:24:56,327
Because I love those
girls too. Kay?

426
00:24:56,996 --> 00:24:58,403
LIZBETH:
Thank you.

427
00:24:58,556 --> 00:24:59,830
ANN: Kay. Let's get
you on that flight.

428
00:25:39,354 --> 00:25:40,538
[knocking]

429
00:25:43,191 --> 00:25:45,768
LIZBETH: Um, I'm
Lizbeth Meredith.

430
00:25:45,786 --> 00:25:46,877
I'm your client from Alaska.

431
00:25:48,289 --> 00:25:50,196
HECTOR: Ms.
Meredith.

432
00:25:50,291 --> 00:25:51,364
I wasn't expecting you.

433
00:25:52,051 --> 00:25:53,676
LIZBETH: Yes I know,
but I needed to come.

434
00:25:54,295 --> 00:25:55,386
HECTOR: Please.

435
00:25:55,537 --> 00:25:56,887
LIZBETH: Oh,
thank you.

436
00:25:58,891 --> 00:26:00,558
HECTOR: I understand
your desire to be here,

437
00:26:00,785 --> 00:26:04,228
but your presence
won't help the process.

438
00:26:06,214 --> 00:26:09,049
LIZBETH: Mr. Pappadakis my
daughters were taken months

439
00:26:09,068 --> 00:26:10,959
ago, and other than
recognizing my

440
00:26:10,978 --> 00:26:13,237
already legal custody
nothing has been done.

441
00:26:15,223 --> 00:26:16,648
TALLY: Lizbeth?
Hi, I'm Tally.

442
00:26:16,801 --> 00:26:17,891
Hello, nice to meet you.

443
00:26:17,985 --> 00:26:19,225
I work with Hector.

444
00:26:19,245 --> 00:26:20,302
Would you like some water?

445
00:26:20,321 --> 00:26:21,970
LIZBETH: Thank
you. Yes.

446
00:26:21,989 --> 00:26:24,156
TALLY: Great so Hector has been
speaking to the embassy about

447
00:26:24,308 --> 00:26:26,041
securing passports for your
daughters isn't that right?

448
00:26:26,827 --> 00:26:27,643
HECTOR: That's
correct.

449
00:26:27,661 --> 00:26:29,144
LIZBETH:
Great. Great.

450
00:26:29,163 --> 00:26:30,162
Cuz as soon as I find
them we'll be on

451
00:26:30,314 --> 00:26:30,921
the first flight back home.

452
00:26:32,833 --> 00:26:37,094
HECTOR: Ms. Meredith there is
a process and if you just take

453
00:26:37,245 --> 00:26:40,413
your children back to Alaska
you will be prosecuted and

454
00:26:40,433 --> 00:26:42,415
your embassy would have no
choice but to work with

455
00:26:42,435 --> 00:26:43,434
the Greek authorities.

456
00:26:45,271 --> 00:26:46,495
LIZBETH: I'm sor-how-how can
I be prosecuted if the Hague

457
00:26:46,588 --> 00:26:47,605
Convention is being followed?

458
00:26:49,925 --> 00:26:51,609
HECTOR: It's
complicated.

459
00:26:51,836 --> 00:26:53,259
LIZBETH: How is
it complicated?

460
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:55,838
My daughters were
kidnapped by my ex-husband

461
00:26:55,856 --> 00:26:57,356
who is a very dangerous man.

462
00:26:57,508 --> 00:26:59,099
There's nothing
complicated about that.

463
00:26:59,601 --> 00:27:00,868
TALLY: Why don't we get
you something to eat.

464
00:27:03,848 --> 00:27:04,771
LIZBETH: Yeah
thank you.

465
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:06,865
That would be-that
would be great,

466
00:27:07,609 --> 00:27:08,959
I still have a lot I need to do.

467
00:27:09,186 --> 00:27:12,354
I need to contact the
consulate and do you-

468
00:27:12,447 --> 00:27:13,780
do you know of any
good budget hotels?

469
00:27:14,208 --> 00:27:15,281
TALLY: Yes.
Of course.

470
00:27:15,301 --> 00:27:15,758
Just let me grab my purse.

471
00:27:28,130 --> 00:27:29,054
TALLY:
Let's go.

472
00:27:29,315 --> 00:27:31,398
LIZBETH: Okay
-Thank you.

473
00:27:40,885 --> 00:27:43,719
TALLY: That's it, uh, it's
just one bedroom

474
00:27:43,812 --> 00:27:44,653
but the sofa pulls out.

475
00:27:45,665 --> 00:27:48,056
LIZBETH: This is
incredibly kind of you.

476
00:27:48,075 --> 00:27:50,058
TALLY: It's not Athens
but fair priced hotels

477
00:27:50,152 --> 00:27:52,152
are hard to find in
Thessaloniki.

478
00:27:53,230 --> 00:27:54,838
But maybe we could
keep this between us?

479
00:27:55,249 --> 00:27:56,899
LIZBETH: Oh
yes, of course.

480
00:27:56,917 --> 00:27:59,325
I don't need another reason for
Hector to be annoyed with me.

481
00:28:00,587 --> 00:28:04,014
TALLY: He's not annoyed
with you. It's the process.

482
00:28:04,166 --> 00:28:05,741
He has to stay focused.

483
00:28:05,759 --> 00:28:08,501
And sometimes that's hard
when emotions get involved.

484
00:28:08,521 --> 00:28:09,669
Trust Hector.

485
00:28:09,689 --> 00:28:11,096
He knows the system,

486
00:28:11,248 --> 00:28:12,505
he's really passionate
about what he does.

487
00:28:12,525 --> 00:28:14,007
He will do everything he can.

488
00:28:14,026 --> 00:28:16,251
LIZBETH: Okay.

489
00:28:16,270 --> 00:28:18,420
But there's got to be
something that I can do?

490
00:28:18,439 --> 00:28:19,771
I-I know what they're
going through.

491
00:28:19,924 --> 00:28:21,606
The same thing happened to
me when I was there age.

492
00:28:21,759 --> 00:28:24,092
My mother took me
from my father.

493
00:28:24,111 --> 00:28:27,371
So look um, do you think
Hector could help me get

494
00:28:27,598 --> 00:28:29,448
my story out to the local news?

495
00:28:29,875 --> 00:28:31,357
TALLY: No, I don't think
he would like that.

496
00:28:31,377 --> 00:28:32,951
LIZBETH: Why?

497
00:28:33,103 --> 00:28:36,696
TALLY: Last year a foreign
woman like yourself came

498
00:28:36,790 --> 00:28:39,199
to Greece to bring
her children home.

499
00:28:39,218 --> 00:28:41,552
She picketed outside
their school,

500
00:28:41,703 --> 00:28:44,112
she received a lot
of media attention.

501
00:28:44,131 --> 00:28:47,891
She ended up with more
enemies then friends,

502
00:28:48,043 --> 00:28:49,143
and never got her children back.

503
00:28:59,146 --> 00:29:01,554
LIZBETH: Hi. I have
an appointment.

504
00:29:01,574 --> 00:29:03,824
Yes, okay, thank you.

505
00:29:05,894 --> 00:29:07,319
PENELOPE:
Ms. Meredith.

506
00:29:07,471 --> 00:29:09,304
It's a pleasure and please,
let me tell you how

507
00:29:09,323 --> 00:29:10,914
sorry I am about your children.

508
00:29:11,141 --> 00:29:12,474
LIZBETH:
Thank you.

509
00:29:12,493 --> 00:29:13,733
I just hope the consulate
can help find them.

510
00:29:13,753 --> 00:29:15,494
PENELOPE: Of course, of
course. Follow me.

511
00:29:15,588 --> 00:29:16,378
LIZBETH: Okay...

512
00:29:25,489 --> 00:29:27,339
LIZBETH: What exactly are
you doing to locate them?

513
00:29:27,825 --> 00:29:29,099
PENELOPE: There are
avenues to explore,

514
00:29:29,326 --> 00:29:32,603
the ministry of
education, hospitals...

515
00:29:35,090 --> 00:29:36,681
LIZBETH: Have
you had any luck?

516
00:29:36,776 --> 00:29:39,592
PENELOPE: Your case
just landed on my desk

517
00:29:39,612 --> 00:29:41,236
after your call yesterday.

518
00:29:43,598 --> 00:29:46,617
LIZBETH: Um, okay
well, this might help.

519
00:29:46,768 --> 00:29:51,013
Um, just some most recent
pictures of Meredith and

520
00:29:51,031 --> 00:29:53,181
MARIANTHI and some
information on Greg

521
00:29:53,275 --> 00:29:54,458
and his family here in Greece.

522
00:30:00,858 --> 00:30:02,707
PENELOPE: Has he been
in contact with you?

523
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:04,543
LIZBETH: No.

524
00:30:04,695 --> 00:30:05,719
No I haven't heard from him or
my girls since he took them.

525
00:30:08,215 --> 00:30:09,306
[door knocking]

526
00:30:11,143 --> 00:30:12,309
LIZBETH: It's a good thing I
flew out here because up until

527
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:14,369
now the consulate has
done absolutely nothing.

528
00:30:14,721 --> 00:30:16,796
So I think we need
to do what we can.

529
00:30:16,816 --> 00:30:19,391
Like hire a private
investigator.

530
00:30:19,485 --> 00:30:21,043
HECTOR: We
did that.

531
00:30:21,061 --> 00:30:23,545
He saw your girls just
once and took the money.

532
00:30:23,564 --> 00:30:26,048
LIZBETH: He saw them?
Where?

533
00:30:26,066 --> 00:30:28,233
HECTOR: When Greg
visited his family.

534
00:30:28,385 --> 00:30:30,994
But after that the investigator
failed to find where they

535
00:30:31,146 --> 00:30:33,330
lived, even though that's
what the crook was paid to do.

536
00:30:34,333 --> 00:30:36,058
LIZBETH: Okay.

537
00:30:36,076 --> 00:30:37,984
Okay so we know that Greg
is in communication

538
00:30:38,078 --> 00:30:39,336
with his family right?

539
00:30:39,487 --> 00:30:42,989
So so we go after them.
We tap their phones...

540
00:30:43,008 --> 00:30:44,842
HECTOR: Tapping
phones is illegal.

541
00:30:46,345 --> 00:30:50,764
LIZBETH: Kidnapping is
illegal. Why is this so hard?

542
00:30:52,334 --> 00:30:54,092
Or or does Greg just
have immunity

543
00:30:54,244 --> 00:30:55,185
here because he's a man?

544
00:30:57,247 --> 00:31:00,506
HECTOR: I won't take offense
to that because you're right.

545
00:31:00,526 --> 00:31:02,767
But that doesn't mean
I'll break the law.

546
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:05,587
And I won't hire any
more investigators.

547
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:08,106
I'll handle your
case as I know how.

548
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:10,367
You just have to be
patient with our system.

549
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:16,522
LIZBETH: I have
been Hector.

550
00:31:16,542 --> 00:31:18,858
I have been patient.

551
00:31:18,878 --> 00:31:23,455
But I haven't seen my
daughters in months.

552
00:31:23,607 --> 00:31:27,718
I haven't touched their
hair or heard them laugh.

553
00:31:27,869 --> 00:31:32,389
I don-... I don't
have anymore patience.

554
00:31:36,061 --> 00:31:44,061
[music]

555
00:31:56,306 --> 00:31:57,973
TALLY: Okay. Great.

556
00:31:58,066 --> 00:31:58,874
I'm gonna tell her, thank you.

557
00:32:00,235 --> 00:32:02,327
That was the woman
from the consulate.

558
00:32:02,479 --> 00:32:04,996
The ministry has a Meredith
and MARIANTHI Diakos

559
00:32:05,090 --> 00:32:08,091
enrolled at a school not
far away from here.

560
00:32:08,318 --> 00:32:09,259
She's going to meet
you there tomorrow.

561
00:32:11,004 --> 00:32:12,320
LIZBETH: Tomorrow?

562
00:32:12,414 --> 00:32:13,263
Tomorrow I'm going to
see my girls, tomorrow?

563
00:32:13,415 --> 00:32:14,673
TALLY: Yes.

564
00:32:14,825 --> 00:32:18,326
LIZBETH: Oh
-oh my god!

565
00:32:18,420 --> 00:32:20,604
I have-I have to
get them something.

566
00:32:20,831 --> 00:32:24,257
I have to pick up a toy or
a gift or a treat or...?

567
00:32:24,276 --> 00:32:25,567
TALLY: I think they'll just
be happy to see their mother.

00:32:59,961 --> 00:33:01,294
LIZBETH: Hi! School's just
down that way right?

571
00:33:01,388 --> 00:33:03,038
PENELOPE: Yes, but I'm sorry,
I tried to reach you...

572
00:33:03,131 --> 00:33:04,222
LIZBETH: Why?
What do you mean?

573
00:33:04,316 --> 00:33:05,390
PENELOPE: I just learned
that your daughters have

574
00:33:05,542 --> 00:33:07,150
not been at school for two days.

575
00:33:07,302 --> 00:33:09,060
LIZBETH: What?
Where are they?

576
00:33:09,213 --> 00:33:11,880
PENELOPE: I don't know, but
I believe your ex-husband was

577
00:33:11,973 --> 00:33:13,882
informed of our contact
with the school.

578
00:33:13,975 --> 00:33:14,733
LIZBETH: You
contacted the school?

579
00:33:14,827 --> 00:33:15,567
PENELOPE: Yes.

580
00:33:15,719 --> 00:33:17,235
LIZBETH: Why?! Why!

581
00:33:17,387 --> 00:33:17,810
PENELOPE: We wanted to make
sure the girls were here...

582
00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:19,312
Lizbeth, please!

583
00:33:19,406 --> 00:33:20,905
Lizbeth it was a bad decision,
I'm sorry but here's the

584
00:33:21,058 --> 00:33:22,666
principal, he will tell
you they're not here...

585
00:33:23,168 --> 00:33:25,393
LIZBETH: Where are Meredith
and MARIANTHI Diakos?

586
00:33:25,412 --> 00:33:26,819
I'm their mother.

587
00:33:26,839 --> 00:33:28,154
You must have some
record of where they are.

588
00:33:28,173 --> 00:33:29,064
Where they live.

589
00:33:29,082 --> 00:33:32,417
PENELOPE: [GREEK]

590
00:33:32,511 --> 00:33:36,254
PRINCIPAL: [GREEK]

591
00:33:36,348 --> 00:33:37,497
PENELOPE:
I'm sorry.

592
00:33:37,516 --> 00:33:38,923
He has no information
to give you.

593
00:33:39,076 --> 00:33:40,600
Their father never provided any.

594
00:33:44,414 --> 00:33:45,689
LIZBETH: You have no
idea what you've done.

595
00:33:47,026 --> 00:33:48,692
PENELOPE: I assure you, we
will find your daughters again.

596
00:33:48,919 --> 00:33:50,935
LIZBETH: Yes, but now
he knows I'm here.

597
00:33:51,088 --> 00:33:52,921
And he's had two days to run
knowing that I'm looking for

598
00:33:53,014 --> 00:33:54,698
them. And we have no idea
where he'll take them,

599
00:33:54,925 --> 00:33:56,199
or what he might do.

[music]

601
00:34:28,216 --> 00:34:29,641
LIZBETH: I know and I
will keep calling until

602
00:34:29,735 --> 00:34:31,234
you have some news...

603
00:34:31,719 --> 00:34:33,403
Fine, fine, I will
call again tomorrow.

604
00:34:33,739 --> 00:34:36,147
TALLY: Still nothing?

605
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:37,465
LIZBETH: No.

606
00:34:37,484 --> 00:34:44,806
TALLY: Here. I know they
made a mistake.

607
00:34:44,825 --> 00:34:48,418
But the consulate will locate
them again. Until then you are

608
00:34:48,570 --> 00:34:50,420
welcome to stay here for
as long as you need to.

609
00:34:51,906 --> 00:34:54,424
LIZBETH: That is
so kind of you.

610
00:34:54,576 --> 00:34:57,243
But it took them months
to find them this time.

611
00:34:57,262 --> 00:34:59,245
And I don't have the
money to hire my own PI.

612
00:34:59,264 --> 00:35:01,723
I spent everything I
had just to get here.

613
00:35:03,493 --> 00:35:06,752
I don't want to leave but
I can't afford to stay.

614
00:35:07,606 --> 00:35:09,272
So until I can figure out
how to pay for all of this,

615
00:35:11,443 --> 00:35:12,692
I have to go.

616
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:15,094
TALLY: Then go.

617
00:35:15,188 --> 00:35:17,172
And the next time you're here,

618
00:35:17,265 --> 00:35:18,949
it will be to take your
girls back home.

GREG: I heard you
were in Greece.

622
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:44,641
LIZBETH: Greg, Greg. I'm
their mother. They need me.

623
00:35:44,792 --> 00:35:47,644
GREG: No they don't.

624
00:35:47,795 --> 00:35:50,889
I told them you don't want them.

625
00:35:51,041 --> 00:35:52,732
They don't ask
about you anymore.

626
00:35:55,562 --> 00:35:57,821
LIZBETH: Let me talk to them
... please put them on the-

627
00:35:57,972 --> 00:35:58,822
put them on the phone-

628
00:35:58,973 --> 00:36:02,308
GREG: You won't
get them back.

629
00:36:02,886 --> 00:36:06,163
And if you try
again, I'll kill you.

630
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:09,666

LIZBETH: Here you go. I've
called for the nurse.

00:36:49,766 --> 00:36:51,041
They're on their way.

636
00:36:53,937 --> 00:36:55,212
SOPHIE: I thought he
was going to kill me.

637
00:36:57,774 --> 00:37:03,053
And all I could think
was, was if I die,

638
00:37:04,723 --> 00:37:06,806
I won't be here for my son.

639
00:37:10,637 --> 00:37:13,730
To protect him and fight
for him if I need to.

640
00:37:22,407 --> 00:37:25,909

So now you can.

LIZBETH: How
are we doing?

JULIA: Everyone's
been very generous,

645
00:37:51,328 --> 00:37:52,844
so... let's hope
we get there.

646
00:37:52,938 --> 00:37:54,345

00:37:55,607 --> 00:37:56,940
LIZBETH: Yeah?

speak to you for a minute?

650
00:37:59,093 --> 00:38:00,593
LIZBETH: Sure. Is
everything okay?

651
00:38:01,429 --> 00:38:02,353
MICHAEL: Greg has
asked the Greek courts

652
00:38:02,506 --> 00:38:03,613
to award him legal custody.

653
00:38:05,784 --> 00:38:07,450
LIZBETH: No they can't do
that. I -I have legal custody.

654
00:38:07,602 --> 00:38:09,119
MICHAEL: I know.

655
00:38:09,270 --> 00:38:10,528
But possession is nine /tenths
of the law and even though

656
00:38:10,622 --> 00:38:12,438
he kidnapped them the girls
are now there, with him.

657
00:38:12,457 --> 00:38:14,532
So there's a possibility
the Greek courts

658
00:38:14,626 --> 00:38:16,710
might not recognize your
custody and award it to Greg.

659
00:38:19,131 --> 00:38:20,046
I'm sorry.

I know it's early there but
I can't wait any longer.

663
00:38:28,473 --> 00:38:30,381
I need to find my girls now.

664
00:38:30,884 --> 00:38:32,309
So I need a private
investigator...

665
00:38:34,371 --> 00:38:36,146
I know, I'll be sure
to get the money.

666
00:38:37,816 --> 00:38:40,984
LIZBETH: Ah, I just settled
Sophie into her room.

667
00:38:41,135 --> 00:38:42,635
JULIA: And her son?

668
00:38:42,654 --> 00:38:43,711
LIZBETH: Yeah.
He's with a friend.

669
00:38:43,805 --> 00:38:44,654
She's bringing him by.

670
00:38:44,881 --> 00:38:46,472
JULIA: Good.

671
00:38:46,566 --> 00:38:47,991
Then you can go back to Greece
knowing that they're safe.

672
00:38:49,811 --> 00:38:50,735
LIZBETH: We did it?

673
00:38:50,829 --> 00:38:52,403
JULIA: We did it.

674
00:38:52,497 --> 00:38:54,480
You have all the money
you need to go and find

675
00:38:54,574 --> 00:38:58,835
your girls and twelve weeks
of paid time off to do it.

676
00:39:00,839 --> 00:39:02,172
LIZBETH: What?

677
00:39:02,399 --> 00:39:04,990
JULIA: Everyone donated
their vacation time.

678
00:39:05,493 --> 00:39:07,344
No one felt that they could
take time off with their

679
00:39:07,571 --> 00:39:10,764
families knowing
that you couldn't.

00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:13,925
LIZBETH: What?

00:39:14,761 --> 00:39:20,248
Oh my God...
I can't believe you.

hits me again. Come on now.

he insisted you meet him.

00:39:40,695 --> 00:39:46,383
TALLY: Yeah.. Lizbeth. I
have to tell you.

686
00:39:46,610 --> 00:39:48,701
After today I
cannot be involved.

687
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:51,446
Because if Hector finds
out that I found you a PI,

688
00:39:51,539 --> 00:39:53,056
he will be furious with me.

689
00:39:54,284 --> 00:39:57,060
LIZBETH: Yeah. I
understand. Don't worry.

690
00:39:57,287 --> 00:39:58,895
Hector doesn't
even know I'm here.

691
00:39:59,122 --> 00:40:04,401
Yeah, okay.

692
00:40:16,748 --> 00:40:17,488
MANOLIS: Sit.

693
00:40:17,641 --> 00:40:18,748
LIZBETH: No thank you.

694
00:40:19,734 --> 00:40:20,417
MANOLIS: Do you
have the money?

695
00:40:21,661 --> 00:40:25,922
LIZBETH: Yeah. I do. Do
you have a plan?

696
00:40:26,741 --> 00:40:27,924
MANOLIS:
Of course.

697
00:40:28,075 --> 00:40:29,575
LIZBETH: What is it?

698
00:40:29,594 --> 00:40:30,743
MANOLIS: You don't
need to question me.

699
00:40:30,762 --> 00:40:31,594
This is my job.

700
00:40:33,506 --> 00:40:34,914
LIZBETH: I'm paying you a
lot of money to do that job,

701
00:40:34,933 --> 00:40:35,849
so I'd like to know
what the plan is.

702
00:40:38,085 --> 00:40:39,769
MANOLIS: You American
women are aggressive, huh?

703
00:40:50,356 --> 00:40:52,264
LIZBETH: Okay, so?

704
00:40:53,100 --> 00:40:55,452
MANOLIS: I know people in
his hometown. His friends.

705
00:40:56,029 --> 00:40:57,195
LIZBETH: No.

706
00:40:57,347 --> 00:40:58,121
Not his friends they'll
just protect him.

707
00:40:58,272 --> 00:40:59,205
You need to get to his family.

708
00:41:00,459 --> 00:41:02,125
MANOLIS: I'll go to
Tyrnavos and we'll see.

709
00:41:02,276 --> 00:41:03,460
While I'm gone you stay.

710
00:41:03,611 --> 00:41:04,852
Don't go anywhere.

711
00:41:04,871 --> 00:41:06,204
LIZBETH: No. No
I'm going with you.

712
00:41:06,356 --> 00:41:07,705
I'm not staying here.

713
00:41:07,857 --> 00:41:09,874
MANOLIS: You're crazy.
They will see you.

714
00:41:11,118 --> 00:41:13,211
LIZBETH: I'm not going to just
sit here and do nothing. I won-

715
00:41:13,305 --> 00:41:14,787
TALLY: Lizbeth I think
you have to stay here.

716
00:41:14,881 --> 00:41:15,805
It will be safer.

717
00:41:17,717 --> 00:41:18,700
LIZBETH: The last time someone
else went to look for my girls

718
00:41:18,793 --> 00:41:21,886
they screwed it
up so no. No.

719
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:23,396
I'm going with him or
he doesn't get paid.

720
00:41:28,561 --> 00:41:30,069
MANOLIS:
Tomorrow. We go.

721
00:41:31,656 --> 00:41:33,239
LIZBETH: Good.
Tomorrow then.

722
00:41:39,647 --> 00:41:47,647
[suspenseful music]

723
00:41:54,404 --> 00:41:55,845
MANOLIS: That
one. His sister's house.

724
00:41:58,517 --> 00:41:59,999
LIZBETH: What are you
going to say to her?

725
00:42:00,685 --> 00:42:01,909
MANOLIS: That she needs to
tell me where her brother

726
00:42:02,003 --> 00:42:03,853
is so he can pay me his debt.

727
00:42:04,856 --> 00:42:06,022
LIZBETH: You think
that'll work?

728
00:42:07,584 --> 00:42:08,942
MANOLIS: Most
people listen to me.

729
00:42:22,874 --> 00:42:24,040
[knocking]

730
00:42:26,936 --> 00:42:34,936
[chattering in Greek]

731
00:42:52,553 --> 00:42:54,219
MANOLIS: She said
Greg is not here.

732
00:42:54,239 --> 00:42:55,888
He left Greece.

733
00:42:55,982 --> 00:42:57,315
But she doesn't know where.

734
00:42:57,801 --> 00:42:59,058
LIZBETH: She's lying.

735
00:42:59,077 --> 00:43:00,076
MANOLIS: Maybe.

736
00:43:01,654 --> 00:43:03,304
LIZBETH: Greg's brother
will know where he is.

737
00:43:04,082 --> 00:43:05,731
When we were married
he used to talk to him

738
00:43:05,825 --> 00:43:06,641
on the phone every week.

739
00:43:06,659 --> 00:43:08,084
I'm sure he still does.

740
00:43:09,145 --> 00:43:10,336
Do what you have to.

741
00:43:24,677 --> 00:43:26,994
TONY: Hey Lizzie?

742
00:43:27,013 --> 00:43:28,605
Hey Lizzie!

743
00:43:31,109 --> 00:43:32,275
LIZBETH: No thank you.

744
00:43:39,784 --> 00:43:41,618
CHERYL: Why do you think
we left your real daddy?

745
00:43:43,179 --> 00:43:44,370
He doesn't want you.

746
00:43:45,531 --> 00:43:46,873
Hasn't come looking
for you has he?

747
00:43:49,018 --> 00:43:51,794
Don't forget how lucky you
are to have a daddy like Tony.

748
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:55,214
Learn to show some gratitude.

749
00:44:00,955 --> 00:44:04,532
MANOLIS: I did it. I tapped the
phones and found them in Pereas.

750
00:44:04,550 --> 00:44:06,367
Tomorrow I take you
to see your girls.

751
00:44:07,553 --> 00:44:09,461
We'll serve him with a court
order so in twenty-four

752
00:44:09,481 --> 00:44:11,230
hours he must give
you your daughters.

753
00:44:12,709 --> 00:44:14,299
LIZBETH: Twenty-four...
twenty-four hours,

754
00:44:14,394 --> 00:44:15,877
what's what's to stop him from

755
00:44:15,970 --> 00:44:17,561
leaving with them again?

756
00:44:17,714 --> 00:44:20,231
MANOLIS: Don't worry, I have
friends in the village who will

757
00:44:20,383 --> 00:44:22,825
watch and make sure he stays.

758
00:44:23,052 --> 00:44:24,661
But I'll need money to pay them.

759
00:44:26,665 --> 00:44:29,223
LIZBETH: I already gave you
twelve thousand dollars.

760
00:44:29,316 --> 00:44:31,242
MANOLIS: To find your
girls, and I did.

761
00:44:31,336 --> 00:44:34,003
LIZBETH: You found them
because I told you what to do.

762
00:44:35,248 --> 00:44:38,733
MANOLIS: So you would tap
his brother's phone hm?

763
00:44:38,826 --> 00:44:40,677
Like some American spy?

764
00:44:43,682 --> 00:44:45,848
Their price is five thousand.

765
00:44:50,596 --> 00:44:58,596
LIZBETH: I-I-I don't have it.
Two thousand. It's all I have.

766
00:45:03,276 --> 00:45:04,951
MANOLIS: Why did
he take them?

767
00:45:08,206 --> 00:45:11,708
LIZBETH: To punish me for
leaving him. He was abusing me

768
00:45:11,859 --> 00:45:14,210
- and I couldn't have them
living like that anymore.

769
00:45:25,131 --> 00:45:26,614
MANOLIS: Bring me
a thousand,

770
00:45:26,707 --> 00:45:27,890
and I'll make sure
they watch him.

771
00:45:31,955 --> 00:45:33,229
LIZBETH: Thank
you-thank you.

772
00:45:39,904 --> 00:45:47,904
[tense music]

773
00:45:54,919 --> 00:46:01,073
[tense music]

774
00:46:01,092 --> 00:46:02,925
MANOLIS: School is finished
in fifteen minutes...

775
00:46:14,255 --> 00:46:15,605
Don't worry. He
won't follow you.

776
00:46:30,771 --> 00:46:33,772
GREG: You stupid bitch. They
don't want you! They hate you!

777
00:46:33,792 --> 00:46:34,457
MANOLIS: Hey hey!

778
00:46:51,458 --> 00:46:54,143
LIZBETH: Meredith
and MARIANTHI Diakos?

779
00:46:54,479 --> 00:46:55,536
TEACHER:
Who are you?

780
00:46:55,629 --> 00:46:56,554
LIZBETH: I'm
their mother.

781
00:46:57,482 --> 00:47:00,483
TEACHER: Oh uh,
please, wait here.

782
00:47:00,985 --> 00:47:01,651
LIZBETH: Okay.

783
00:47:05,156 --> 00:47:06,730
TEACHER: MARIANTHI,
Meredith. Look.

784
00:47:06,825 --> 00:47:07,898
It's your mother.

785
00:47:07,992 --> 00:47:09,492
Give her a hug.

786
00:47:12,479 --> 00:47:15,906
LIZBETH: Hello
my brave girls.

787
00:47:16,059 --> 00:47:17,834
I've been looking for
you for a long time.

788
00:47:19,653 --> 00:47:20,728
I've missed you so much.

789
00:47:21,414 --> 00:47:22,246
MARIANTHI: Go away!
Leave me alone!

790
00:47:22,398 --> 00:47:23,488
I don't want to go with you!

791
00:47:23,583 --> 00:47:24,748
TEACHER:
MARIANTHI stop it.

792
00:47:24,843 --> 00:47:26,250
Your mother loves you,
she came to find you.

793
00:47:27,070 --> 00:47:28,177
MARIANTHI: No she doesn't.
She doesn't want us!!

794
00:47:28,404 --> 00:47:29,178
I hate her!

795
00:47:31,015 --> 00:47:32,515
LIZBETH: Okay.
It's okay. It's okay.

796
00:47:33,351 --> 00:47:37,261
Hey, hey, hey.

797
00:47:37,413 --> 00:47:39,930
I know what your
father's told you.

798
00:47:40,083 --> 00:47:45,862
But I would never have left
you, not in a million years.

799
00:47:46,013 --> 00:47:47,771
Because I love you.

800
00:47:47,924 --> 00:47:50,441
I love you both so much.

801
00:47:51,518 --> 00:47:55,705
TEACHER: Please, you
have to take them.

802
00:47:55,932 --> 00:47:58,933
They come to school only
for a few days a month

803
00:47:58,951 --> 00:48:02,453
and they are never
bathed or cared for.

804
00:48:03,030 --> 00:48:04,955
They are just confused.

805
00:48:05,049 --> 00:48:07,108
We are all confused.

806
00:48:07,201 --> 00:48:09,552
They told us that you were dead.

807
00:48:14,967 --> 00:48:16,634
LIZBETH: Their father has just
been served with a court order

808
00:48:16,728 --> 00:48:19,061
giving him twenty-four
hours to return them to me.

809
00:48:20,623 --> 00:48:22,064
Until then there's
nothing that I can do.

810
00:48:26,404 --> 00:48:31,799
Girls, hey. I'll
see you tomorrow.

811
00:48:31,817 --> 00:48:34,911
It's going to be okay.

812
00:48:35,062 --> 00:48:36,746
I promise you okay.

813
00:48:53,489 --> 00:48:54,555
GREG: Where
are they?

814
00:48:55,749 --> 00:48:56,599
Guess they didn't
want to come with you?

815
00:48:59,829 --> 00:49:01,753
LIZBETH: You can tell
them what you want Greg.

816
00:49:01,773 --> 00:49:04,999
But as you can see
I'm very much alive.

817
00:49:05,017 --> 00:49:06,525
And tomorrow my girls
and I are going home.

818
00:49:20,183 --> 00:49:21,457
LIZBETH: They didn't
want to go with me.

819
00:49:23,536 --> 00:49:24,877
They didn't even want
me to touch them.

820
00:49:27,023 --> 00:49:28,447
MANOLIS:
Don't worry.

821
00:49:28,466 --> 00:49:31,192
Tomorrow when you are able
to take them you will have

822
00:49:31,285 --> 00:49:33,618
help from the police
and the consulate.

823
00:49:34,455 --> 00:49:35,596
LIZBETH: And what if
he disappears again?

824
00:49:36,882 --> 00:49:38,882
MANOLIS: He knows I have
friends watching him.

825
00:49:39,035 --> 00:49:40,309
He won't go anywhere.

826
00:49:47,801 --> 00:49:51,404
GREG: Hey you
two. How are you?

827
00:50:05,670 --> 00:50:07,753
LIZBETH: [CRYING] Oh
god, just go, just go.

828
00:50:24,930 --> 00:50:26,772
GREG: Welcome
ladies.

829
00:50:28,768 --> 00:50:31,585
Your friend here
arrived before you so,

830
00:50:31,678 --> 00:50:33,696
we've been getting
to know one another.

831
00:50:34,774 --> 00:50:36,032
Come on, join us?

832
00:50:36,442 --> 00:50:37,349
Have something to eat?

833
00:50:37,368 --> 00:50:39,109
Drink?

834
00:50:39,262 --> 00:50:40,928
PENELOPE: We're here to return
the girls to their mother.

835
00:50:40,946 --> 00:50:43,430
GREG: Well, I was just
telling the police chief

836
00:50:43,449 --> 00:50:45,599
how they don't want
to go with her.

837
00:50:45,618 --> 00:50:48,527
Because why would they want to
leave this beautiful country?

838
00:50:48,546 --> 00:50:50,454
Their family.

839
00:50:50,606 --> 00:50:51,939
For America?

840
00:50:52,032 --> 00:50:53,049
BAILIFF: Just
bring us the girls.

841
00:50:55,369 --> 00:50:56,368
GREG: And you are?

842
00:50:56,387 --> 00:50:57,887
LIZBETH: He's the
court bailiff.

843
00:50:58,114 --> 00:50:58,387
He's here to make sure that
you follow the court order.

844
00:51:01,559 --> 00:51:02,516
POLICE CHIEF:
Bring them.

845
00:51:04,395 --> 00:51:11,734
GREG: Okay. You can see
them. MARIANTHI! Meredith!

846
00:51:19,468 --> 00:51:20,534
LIZBETH: Hi.

847
00:51:24,064 --> 00:51:25,564
GREG: See?

848
00:51:25,658 --> 00:51:27,750
I told you she was going to
try and take you to America.

849
00:51:28,811 --> 00:51:30,753
BAILIFF: Girls, you must
go with your mother now.

850
00:51:31,905 --> 00:51:33,071
MARIANTHI: We
don't want to go.

851
00:51:33,165 --> 00:51:34,573
We're happy here.

852
00:51:34,592 --> 00:51:36,317
We have toys,
friends and family.

853
00:51:36,594 --> 00:51:38,427
GREG: What did
I tell you?

854
00:51:38,579 --> 00:51:41,013
They don't want

Do you remember her?

862
00:52:02,011 --> 00:52:03,177
She used to come
over all the time,

863
00:52:03,270 --> 00:52:05,246
she'd always bring
you both a toy.

864

one of those too.

865

take a bus or a train.

PENELOPE: Ms. Meredith
you have no need to worry.

889
00:53:41,293 --> 00:53:43,110
You've had Mr.
Diakos arrested.

890
00:53:43,128 --> 00:53:44,386
LIZBETH: But how long
can they hold him?

891
00:53:44,538 --> 00:53:46,371
Cuz he told me that if I
came back, he would kill me.

892
00:53:46,390 --> 00:53:47,948
PENELOPE: Then the consulate
is the safest place to be.

893
00:53:48,041 --> 00:53:49,950
And I assure you, we
will have you on a

894

LIZBETH: MARIANTHI, you have
to brush your teeth okay?

905
00:55:02,191 --> 00:55:04,466
LIZBETH: I know it's
been a long time,

906
00:55:04,693 --> 00:55:07,118
but when we were back home
we would wake up,

907
00:55:07,212 --> 00:55:09,305
we brush teeth, brush hair.

908
00:55:09,456 --> 00:55:12,266

LIZBETH: Please, please
you have to listen to me.

937
00:57:14,080 --> 00:57:16,823
My ex-husband, he's the one
who kidnapped them.

938
00:57:16,842 --> 00:57:20,919
Just check the FBI's
NCIC data base. Please.

I tell you?

LIZBETH: There's a warrant
out for your arrest Greg.

952
00:57:54,379 --> 00:57:55,804
Because you kidnapped them.

953
00:57:56,790 --> 00:57:57,864
GREG: How
dare you!

954
00:57:57,958 --> 00:57:59,032
This is where they belong!

955
00:57:59,051 --> 00:58:00,642
With me, their father!

956
00:58:00,794 --> 00:58:03,127
LIZBETH: You don't care about
them. You don't even bathe

957
00:58:03,147 --> 00:58:06,223
them. You're just doing
this to punish me.

958
00:58:06,317 --> 00:58:08,066
And those precious girls
are paying the price.

959
00:58:09,153 --> 00:58:10,652

taking my children!

confirmed that your charges

against her for
kidnapping are false.

district attorney.

974
00:58:39,258 --> 00:58:41,350
Mr. Diakos has appealed
for custody arrangements.

975
00:58:41,577 --> 00:58:43,167
So there must be a hearing
before you can leave.

976
00:58:43,912 --> 00:58:44,761
PENELOPE: How
can he appeal?

977
00:58:44,913 --> 00:58:46,580
There's a warrant
for his arrest.

978
00:58:46,598 --> 00:58:48,081
IMMIGRATION OFFICER 2: Greece
hasn't recognized those charges.

979
00:58:48,174 --> 00:58:50,526
So the court now will decide
what is best for the children.

980
00:58:50,677 --> 00:58:52,778
Until then, they
on stay with you.

scary that was.

But I am your mom and
I won't leave you.

987
00:59:34,220 --> 00:59:35,571

We can go to the
beach, or the park, or-

1025
01:01:21,069 --> 01:01:21,993
MEREDITH: Yes please.

1026
01:01:22,087 --> 01:01:25,514
LIZBETH: Yes.
MARIANTHI?

1027
01:01:26,925 --> 01:01:27,908
Okay, let's do it.

1028
01:01:28,185 --> 01:01:29,101
Come on, come on.

1029
01:01:30,837 --> 01:01:31,853
LIZBETH: Go
check it out.

1030
01:01:32,080 --> 01:01:32,854
See how fast those
slides are, yeah?

1031
01:01:36,768 --> 01:01:37,526
MEREDITH: Come on!

1032
01:01:44,702 --> 01:01:46,535
MARIANTHI & MEREDITH:
Three, two, one... Gooo!

1033
01:01:47,871 --> 01:01:48,929
LIZBETH: Woo-hoo!

1034
01:01:49,022 --> 01:01:50,113
MEREDITH:
Push me mommy.

1035
01:01:50,265 --> 01:01:52,207
LIZBETH:
Yeah? Okay.

1036
01:01:53,936 --> 01:01:55,285
How high you want to go?

1037
01:01:55,437 --> 01:01:56,712
MEREDITH: Super high.

1038
01:01:56,863 --> 01:01:58,213
LIZBETH: Super high, the
highest you've ever been?

1039
01:02:00,125 --> 01:02:01,624
MARIANTHI: Push me?

1040
01:02:02,035 --> 01:02:05,387
LIZBETH: Yeah
sure. Here we go.

1041
01:02:09,301 --> 01:02:14,146
[laughing]

1042
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:17,733
MEREDITH: Higher!

1043
01:02:17,884 --> 01:02:21,737
[giggling]

1044
01:02:28,487 --> 01:02:32,472
HECTOR:
[GREEK]

1045
01:02:32,491 --> 01:02:35,158
LIZBETH:
Hello. Hector?

1046
01:02:35,252 --> 01:02:38,311
I wanted to introduce
you to my daughters,

1047
01:02:38,404 --> 01:02:40,422
Meredith and MARIANTHI.

1048
01:02:41,925 --> 01:02:43,592
Girls, this is the man
who's going to help us.

1049
01:02:44,836 --> 01:02:45,910
HECTOR: Did you know...?

1050
01:02:46,004 --> 01:02:50,156
TALLY: Hi girls.
Hi. I'm Tally.

1051
01:02:50,250 --> 01:02:52,175
I'm a friend of your mother's.

1052
01:02:52,327 --> 01:02:54,010
Would you like some candy?

1053
01:02:54,162 --> 01:02:57,255
We have a bowl here
for special clients.

1054
01:02:57,666 --> 01:02:58,774
Come, we'll pick flavors.

1055
01:03:02,504 --> 01:03:04,613
HECTOR: Should I ask
how you found them?

1056
01:03:04,840 --> 01:03:06,597
LIZBETH: No.

1057
01:03:06,617 --> 01:03:08,283
HECTOR: Alright.

1058
01:03:08,510 --> 01:03:10,786
Now I guess we have work
to do to get you all home.

1059
01:03:14,366 --> 01:03:21,379
HECTOR: [GREEK]

1060
01:03:24,468 --> 01:03:25,467
HECTOR: I've learnt the
proceedings will be

1061
01:03:25,618 --> 01:03:27,877
heard by Judge Georgiou.

1062
01:03:27,971 --> 01:03:32,790
I've never been in his court
but we have a strong case.

1063
01:03:32,884 --> 01:03:34,392
But still, the judge wants
to question your daughters.

1064
01:03:35,479 --> 01:03:36,127
LIZBETH: What?

1065
01:03:36,146 --> 01:03:37,479
No, no, no. no.

1066
01:03:37,630 --> 01:03:39,314
I don't want them to have
to go through that, I-

1067
01:03:39,465 --> 01:03:40,798
HECTOR: I know,
and I'm sorry.

1068
01:03:40,892 --> 01:03:42,150
But it has to be so.

1069
01:03:45,638 --> 01:03:47,155
CHERYL: Okay.
You ready?

1070
01:03:48,050 --> 01:03:49,658
You know what to say.

1071
01:03:52,162 --> 01:03:54,220
CHERYL: Good
morning, Judge.

1072
01:03:54,239 --> 01:03:55,914
JUDGE: Ah, you must be
Lizbeth Meredith.

1073
01:03:57,317 --> 01:03:59,584
Why don't you sit and your
mother can wait outside.

1074
01:04:07,752 --> 01:04:09,845
JUDGE: So tell me.

1075
01:04:09,996 --> 01:04:12,180
If there's one person in the
whole world you'd call your

1076
01:04:12,332 --> 01:04:15,350
daddy, who would that person be?

1077
01:04:25,678 --> 01:04:27,678
TALLY: [SINGING]
One, two!

1078
01:04:27,698 --> 01:04:35,698
MEREDITH: [LAUGHING]
I got it!

1079
01:04:38,208 --> 01:04:42,118
LIZBETH: Oh my god,
oh you're here.

1080
01:04:42,270 --> 01:04:47,632
You're here, .
Oh., ,,

1081
01:04:51,947 --> 01:04:53,947
Girls, girls come see Ann.

1082
01:04:54,040 --> 01:04:55,056
Come here, come here, come here!

1083
01:04:55,283 --> 01:04:59,728
ANN: Look at you two. Do
you remember me?

1084
01:05:01,214 --> 01:05:03,315
Well in case you
have forgotten...

1085
01:05:04,401 --> 01:05:06,735
These are for you.

1086
01:05:07,812 --> 01:05:09,053
MARIANTHI:
Thank you.

1087
01:05:09,147 --> 01:05:10,071
MEREDITH:
Thank you

1088
01:05:10,223 --> 01:05:12,073
ANN: You're so
very welcome...

1089
01:05:15,913 --> 01:05:17,654
So how are they?

1090
01:05:18,140 --> 01:05:21,899
LIZBETH:
Better. But-

1091
01:05:21,919 --> 01:05:22,751
ANN: No.

1092
01:05:22,978 --> 01:05:24,419
Don't worry.

1093
01:05:24,570 --> 01:05:26,479
You're going to have their
whole lives to undo

1094
01:05:26,572 --> 01:05:28,148
the damage that was done here.

1095
01:05:28,166 --> 01:05:32,410
Because there is no way that
Greg is going to win this case.

1096
01:05:32,429 --> 01:05:34,429
Okay?

1097
01:05:34,580 --> 01:05:36,014
LIZBETH: Yeah.

1098
01:05:41,846 --> 01:05:42,938
ANN: You found them!

1099
01:05:43,165 --> 01:05:44,588
LIZBETH: I found
them. I found them.

1100
01:05:44,683 --> 01:05:45,273
ANN: You found them.

1101
01:05:45,425 --> 01:05:46,191
LIZBETH: Yes, I did.

1102
01:05:54,176 --> 01:05:55,450
LIZBETH: Okay, can I
just have a second?

1103
01:05:56,769 --> 01:05:58,528
Okay girls.

1104
01:05:58,622 --> 01:06:01,514
Alright so just remember,
when you talk to the judge,

1105
01:06:01,533 --> 01:06:02,773
just tell them the truth.

1106
01:06:02,793 --> 01:06:03,941
Okay?

1107
01:06:03,961 --> 01:06:05,685
That's all he wants to hear.

1108
01:06:05,704 --> 01:06:07,462
Alright go ahead.

1109
01:06:22,554 --> 01:06:23,794
HECTOR: Clever of
him to hire a woman.

1110
01:06:23,814 --> 01:06:25,230
But don't worry, it
won't change anything.

1111
01:06:40,664 --> 01:06:42,080
[GAVEL]

1112
01:06:43,333 --> 01:06:44,332
HECTOR: Be
prepared.

1113
01:06:44,484 --> 01:06:45,892
Our courts operate differently.

1114
01:06:46,486 --> 01:06:49,820
JUDGE GEORGIOU: This hearing
is about child kidnapping.

1115
01:06:49,914 --> 01:06:55,010
The father abducted the
children from Alaska and then

1116
01:06:55,237 --> 01:06:57,178
the mother attempted
to do the same here.

1117
01:06:58,573 --> 01:06:59,906
HECTOR: Your honor,
this is not the same.

1118
01:06:59,999 --> 01:07:01,741
She already had custody!

1119
01:07:01,760 --> 01:07:03,243
TINA: She is not in
America your honor!

1120
01:07:03,261 --> 01:07:04,594
We have our own laws!

1121
01:07:04,688 --> 01:07:06,187
[GAVEL]

1122
01:07:08,917 --> 01:07:11,192
JUDGE GEORGIOU:
Gregory Diakos.

1123
01:07:11,344 --> 01:07:14,087
Sir do you have a job?

1124
01:07:14,105 --> 01:07:16,589
GREG: Of course. I work at
the Hotel Kastoria.

1125
01:07:16,682 --> 01:07:18,349
JUDGE GEORGIOU:
Really?

1126
01:07:18,443 --> 01:07:20,368
And how is that possible when
it's been closed for five years?

1127
01:07:21,279 --> 01:07:22,537
[chuckling]

1128
01:07:22,764 --> 01:07:25,356
GREG: Uh, I meant
to say Hotel Argos.

1129
01:07:26,101 --> 01:07:29,102
JUDGE: Mm. And did you
kidnap your daughters

1130
01:07:29,195 --> 01:07:30,787
and bring them to Greece?

1131
01:07:30,881 --> 01:07:33,048
GREG: No. Never!

1132
01:07:33,275 --> 01:07:35,608
Their mother said I
could take them.

1133
01:07:35,701 --> 01:07:37,293
And now I'm being falsely

1134
01:07:37,445 --> 01:07:39,870
accused by a woman who
does not even have

1135
01:07:39,890 --> 01:07:42,465
a relationship with
her own mother.

1136
01:07:42,559 --> 01:07:47,395
But here in Greece my
daughters have family.

1137
01:07:51,142 --> 01:07:54,811
HECTOR: Mr. Diakos, why have
your daughters only been in

1138
01:07:54,963 --> 01:07:57,155
school for sixty days
in almost two years?

1139
01:07:59,651 --> 01:08:01,076
GREG: We are busy.

1140
01:08:01,303 --> 01:08:03,803
HECTOR: Working
at Hotel Kastoria?

1141
01:08:03,822 --> 01:08:05,246
[laughter]

1142
01:08:07,567 --> 01:08:09,084
JUDGE GEORGIOU:
Ms. Meredith.

1143
01:08:11,996 --> 01:08:15,239
Ma'am is it true social workers
have been called to your home

1144
01:08:15,258 --> 01:08:17,425
in Alaska for abusing
your children.

1145
01:08:19,262 --> 01:08:21,262
ANN: How does
he know that?

1146
01:08:22,265 --> 01:08:24,324
LIZBETH: Greg would call
them every time I refused to

1147
01:08:24,342 --> 01:08:27,084
reconcile with him.
And every time,

1148
01:08:27,104 --> 01:08:30,421
they found his
claims to be false.

1149
01:08:31,499 --> 01:08:32,332
JUDGE GEORGIOU: Why
did you not want to

1150
01:08:32,350 --> 01:08:33,775
reconcile with your husband?

1151
01:08:36,354 --> 01:08:38,688
LIZBETH: Because in the four
years I was married to Greg

1152
01:08:38,782 --> 01:08:44,694
he gambled, did drugs,
rarely held down a job.

1153
01:08:44,846 --> 01:08:46,696
There were days he
wouldn't even come home.

1154
01:08:46,848 --> 01:08:49,624
And when he did, he would beat
me, in front of his daughters.

1155
01:08:51,277 --> 01:08:52,869
There are police records -

1156
01:08:53,021 --> 01:08:54,963
TINA: Your honor those records
have no merit in our country.

1157
01:08:59,027 --> 01:09:00,885
JUDGE GEORGIOU:
Please, continue.

1158
01:09:03,122 --> 01:09:07,383
LIZBETH: My whole life has
been about protecting my girls,

1159
01:09:07,535 --> 01:09:10,145
providing a safe and stable
home for them.

1160
01:09:11,631 --> 01:09:14,149
A home where they have friends,

1161
01:09:14,300 --> 01:09:16,893
where they go to
school every day.

1162
01:09:17,045 --> 01:09:19,970
Where I never denied their
father the right to see them.

1163
01:09:19,990 --> 01:09:24,159
But I never gave him
permission to take them.

1164
01:09:26,070 --> 01:09:27,996
And ever since the day
that Greg kidnapped them,

1165
01:09:28,223 --> 01:09:30,223
I have been trying
to get them back.

1166
01:09:31,242 --> 01:09:34,318
Even after he threatened
to kill me for my efforts.

1167
01:09:34,412 --> 01:09:38,673
Because, because
I love my girls.

1168
01:09:43,254 --> 01:09:45,680
I love my girls
with my whole being.

1169
01:09:49,502 --> 01:09:53,003
So please, please
don't ask them to

1170
01:09:53,023 --> 01:09:55,081
choose where they want to live.

1171
01:09:55,099 --> 01:09:57,934
Just let them come
home, back to the life

1172
01:09:58,028 --> 01:10:00,028
they knew before they
were taken from me.

1173
01:10:02,682 --> 01:10:05,591
JUDGE GEORGIOU: Thank you
for your candor Ms. Meredith.

1174
01:10:05,610 --> 01:10:08,110
But in order for me
to make a ruling,

1175
01:10:08,263 --> 01:10:10,930
I must speak to your girls.

1176
01:10:11,023 --> 01:10:13,374
But I will do so gently.

1177
01:10:14,026 --> 01:10:15,210
LIZBETH:
Thank you.

1178
01:10:23,127 --> 01:10:23,867
LIZBETH: That judge has
been talking to them

1179
01:10:23,962 --> 01:10:25,553
for over an hour.

1180
01:10:25,705 --> 01:10:27,113
ANN: You don't know he's been
with them the whole time.

1181
01:10:27,131 --> 01:10:28,464
HECTOR:
She's right.

1182
01:10:28,558 --> 01:10:30,132
He's likely taking his
time to make a ruling.

1183
01:10:30,285 --> 01:10:31,375
LIZBETH: Is that
a good thing?

1184
01:10:31,394 --> 01:10:32,301
HECTOR: Everyone
agrees he seemed very

1185
01:10:32,454 --> 01:10:33,711
sympathetic to your testimony.

1186
01:10:33,730 --> 01:10:36,397
ANN: And he laughed
in Greg's face.

1187
01:10:40,570 --> 01:10:42,311
LIZBETH: What do you
really think Ann?

1188
01:10:42,405 --> 01:10:44,405
ANN: I think everyone knows
that you're telling the truth.

1189
01:10:48,803 --> 01:10:50,245
HECTOR: The
judge is back.

1190
01:10:51,248 --> 01:10:52,247
LIZBETH: Okay.

1191
01:11:06,579 --> 01:11:08,504
JUDGE GEORGIOU: It is clear
that the children were taken

1192
01:11:08,656 --> 01:11:12,350
illegally from their mother's
custody and brought to Greece.

1193
01:11:15,680 --> 01:11:19,181
But the children have now been
in Greece for almost two years.

1194
01:11:19,276 --> 01:11:21,442
And uprooting them again
would be a mistake.

1195
01:11:24,597 --> 01:11:29,117
As such, I am awarding custody
to their father Gregory Diakos.

1196
01:11:31,788 --> 01:11:34,938
[chatter]

1197
01:11:35,350 --> 01:11:37,274
JUDGE GEORGIOU:
Lizbeth Meredith,

1198
01:11:37,368 --> 01:11:40,520
once you have been served you
will have three days to return

1199
01:11:40,538 --> 01:11:42,630
the girls to their father.

1200
01:11:44,542 --> 01:11:46,283
[gavel]

1201
01:11:46,303 --> 01:11:52,974
LIZBETH: [CRYING]

1202
01:11:54,536 --> 01:11:55,977
LIZBETH: How
did this happen?

1203
01:11:56,128 --> 01:11:57,870
Everyone could see he was lying!

1204
01:11:58,631 --> 01:12:00,206
HECTOR: Which makes me think
Greg's lawyer made a deal with

1205
01:12:00,224 --> 01:12:01,874
the judge, and the
decision was already made.

1206
01:12:02,986 --> 01:12:05,320
It would explain how he knew
details of your marriage.

1207
01:12:05,547 --> 01:12:06,637
LIZBETH: She can
get away with that?!

1208
01:12:06,731 --> 01:12:08,990
HECTOR: It
happens.

1209
01:12:09,567 --> 01:12:11,308
LIZBETH: So that judge put
my girls through all of that

1210
01:12:11,328 --> 01:12:13,719
questioning when he
already knew the answer?

1211
01:12:14,164 --> 01:12:15,404
HECTOR: I'm
sorry Lizbeth.

1212
01:12:15,557 --> 01:12:16,914
I really thought
we had this one.

1213
01:12:18,242 --> 01:12:19,834
LIZBETH: No.
No, no, no.

1214
01:12:20,061 --> 01:12:23,338
No that can't be it.
That's not it.

1215
01:12:25,083 --> 01:12:27,157
They're not going to honor
the Hague convention

1216
01:12:27,177 --> 01:12:28,325
or the warrant against him?

1217
01:12:28,345 --> 01:12:29,677
Just none of it?

1218
01:12:29,904 --> 01:12:32,755
HECTOR: No. But we
can keep fighting.

1219
01:12:32,849 --> 01:12:34,090
File an appeal.

1220
01:12:34,242 --> 01:12:36,351
You have 3 days until
his custody begins,

1221
01:12:37,837 --> 01:12:39,687
but I can't in good conscience
give you much hope.

1222
01:12:45,920 --> 01:12:48,529
LIZBETH: I have to
go get the girls.

1223
01:12:51,368 --> 01:12:52,533
My god.

1224
01:12:59,784 --> 01:13:02,335
MARIANTHI: I don't want
to stay here anymore.

1225
01:13:04,363 --> 01:13:05,713
LIZBETH: I know, but if we
try to leave the same thing

1226
01:13:05,865 --> 01:13:07,607
will happen again
at the airport.

1227
01:13:07,700 --> 01:13:09,533
MARIANTHI: But he
doesn't feed us.

1228
01:13:09,627 --> 01:13:14,204
He leaves us alone, and when I
tried to have a friend and gave

1229
01:13:14,224 --> 01:13:18,684
her some of our
chocolate, he choked me.

1230
01:13:24,292 --> 01:13:25,733
LIZBETH: Baby. None of
that was your fault.

1231
01:13:29,722 --> 01:13:30,738
MEREDITH: I'm sorry.

1232
01:13:32,409 --> 01:13:35,651
LIZBETH: Oh what, baby what
-what are you sorry for?

1233
01:13:35,745 --> 01:13:39,396
MEREDITH: I-I told that man
that I only want to visit you.

1234
01:13:39,416 --> 01:13:41,474
That I want to stay here.

1235
01:13:41,567 --> 01:13:43,809
That's what daddy
tells me to say.

1236
01:13:43,903 --> 01:13:45,736
But I don't want to stay.

1237
01:13:45,830 --> 01:13:46,754
So it's all my fault.

1238
01:13:47,331 --> 01:13:48,981
LIZBETH: No.

1239
01:13:49,074 --> 01:13:50,925
No, no, no, no, come here, come
here baby it is not your fault.

1240
01:13:51,335 --> 01:13:52,910
Okay.

1241
01:13:53,004 --> 01:13:57,748
None of this is your fault.
And I will never stop trying

1242
01:13:57,842 --> 01:14:00,843
to get us all home together.

1243
01:14:00,937 --> 01:14:02,678
I promise you.

1244
01:14:02,830 --> 01:14:04,680
CHERYL: What
is it, Lizbeth?

1245
01:14:04,832 --> 01:14:06,165
YOUNG LIZBETH:
Are we moving?

1246
01:14:06,184 --> 01:14:08,350
CHERYL: Oh Lizzy
me and Tony are.

1247
01:14:08,445 --> 01:14:10,069
Sorry but there's no room
for you in the mobile.

1248
01:14:11,689 --> 01:14:13,614
YOUNG LIZBETH: So where
am I supposed to go?

1249
01:14:13,841 --> 01:14:16,433
CHERYL: I dunno
stay with a friend?

1250
01:14:16,453 --> 01:14:18,027
Go live with your
sister in Seattle maybe?

1251
01:14:18,121 --> 01:14:20,604
You'll figure it out.

1252
01:14:20,623 --> 01:14:22,014
[glass smashing]

1253
01:14:22,033 --> 01:14:23,273
CHERYL: Damnit!

1254
01:14:23,367 --> 01:14:31,132
YOUNG LIZBETH:
[CRYING]

1255
01:15:01,239 --> 01:15:02,330
LIZBETH: Okay,
go ahead.

1256
01:15:04,058 --> 01:15:05,166
MARIANTHI: Where
are we going?

1257
01:15:05,393 --> 01:15:06,501
LIZBETH: We're gonna
meet Ann and Tally.

1258
01:15:06,652 --> 01:15:08,410
Okay, okay.
Come on.

1259
01:15:08,505 --> 01:15:10,796
In you go.

1260
01:15:22,260 --> 01:15:24,426
LIZBETH: I can't do it.

1261
01:15:24,579 --> 01:15:26,687
Even if I stay here he'll
never play by the rules -

1262
01:15:26,914 --> 01:15:28,247
he'll just disappear with
them again.

1263
01:15:28,266 --> 01:15:31,250
And I can't give
them back to him

1264
01:15:31,343 --> 01:15:32,693
knowing he's going to hurt them.

1265
01:15:35,089 --> 01:15:37,031
I have to get them back
home, back to Alaska

1266
01:15:37,258 --> 01:15:39,033
where my custody
will be recognized.

1267
01:15:40,370 --> 01:15:42,278
TALLY: There's an airport
from the island of Kos.

1268
01:15:42,372 --> 01:15:44,780
The last time I was there they
had no computerized passport

1269
01:15:44,932 --> 01:15:47,333
system. From there you
could fly anywhere.

1270
01:15:48,936 --> 01:15:50,286
ANN: And how would
she get to the island?

1271
01:15:50,380 --> 01:15:52,104
TALLY: By ferry.

1272
01:15:52,123 --> 01:15:54,957
I could have a friend meet you
when it docks, as your husband,

1273
01:15:55,109 --> 01:15:55,883
so it doesn't look suspicious.

1274
01:15:57,870 --> 01:16:00,946
LIZBETH: I mean, that
could work.

1275
01:16:01,040 --> 01:16:02,515
As long as Greg
doesn't catch me.

1276
01:16:15,220 --> 01:16:16,478
LIZBETH: We're
going home.

1277
01:16:17,073 --> 01:16:19,064
MARIANTHI: But I
thought we couldn't.

1278
01:16:19,967 --> 01:16:21,725
LIZBETH: They
said we can't.

1279
01:16:21,744 --> 01:16:23,578
But sometimes you have to
do what you know is right.

1280
01:16:25,323 --> 01:16:28,374
And as your mother I know that
we need to get home to Alaska.

1281
01:16:31,662 --> 01:16:34,330
But it's not going to be easy
so I need you both to tell me

1282
01:16:34,482 --> 01:16:37,592
right now, do you really
want to come with me?

1283
01:16:39,262 --> 01:16:40,761
MEREDITH: I do.

1284
01:16:41,598 --> 01:16:42,722
MARIANTHI: Me too.

1285
01:16:44,100 --> 01:16:47,268
LIZBETH:
Good. Okay.

1286
01:16:47,419 --> 01:16:48,436
Then I'm going to
tell you the plan.

That way, that way!

01:19:10,805 --> 01:19:14,707

01:25:15,111 --> 01:25:16,610
My brave girls.

1362
01:25:18,505 --> 01:25:19,780
ANN: So how's
therapy?

1363
01:25:21,525 --> 01:25:23,842
LIZBETH: It's hard. But I
know that the more they talk

1364
01:25:23,935 --> 01:25:26,787
about it the more
they'll heal so.

1365
01:25:29,291 --> 01:25:31,107
ANN: Don't worry.

1366
01:25:31,201 --> 01:25:33,293
Don't worry they'll
get through it.

1367
01:25:33,445 --> 01:25:34,294
They have you.

1368
01:25:37,858 --> 01:25:40,542
LIZBETH: Oh Ann,
they're the strong ones.

1369
01:25:40,694 --> 01:25:43,053
I'm just the lucky one who
gets to be here for all of it.

1370
01:25:51,388 --> 01:25:53,388
MARIANTHI: Mommy can
you come push me?

1371
01:25:53,540 --> 01:25:54,731
LIZBETH: Yeah.
Of course.

1372
01:25:58,212 --> 01:26:01,638
Alright you ready?
You too!

1373
01:26:01,732 --> 01:26:05,909
Come here.
Here we go.

1374
01:26:10,891 --> 01:26:11,665
Higher?

1375
01:26:11,816 --> 01:26:12,574
MARIANTHI: Higher!

1376
01:26:12,668 --> 01:26:13,392
LIZBETH: Higher.

1377
01:26:13,410 --> 01:26:14,168
MEREDITH: Yeah!

1378
01:26:22,419 --> 01:26:23,510
MARIANTHI: Mer!

1379
01:26:24,996 --> 01:26:26,597
MEREDITH:
Yeah. Higher!
