sometimes the best way
to do something

191
00:09:21,836 --> 00:09:26,102

in broad daylight.

00:25:49,790 --> 00:25:51,758
then he's... this guy's...

550
00:25:51,825 --> 00:25:53,850
Hello.

551
00:25:55,796 --> 00:25:57,730
Hi. Sorry
to intrude.

552
00:25:57,798 --> 00:25:58,730
Evan Marsh

553
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:00,892
from just across
the way.

554
00:26:02,603 --> 00:26:03,865
Who are you people?

555
00:26:03,938 --> 00:26:06,372
We're friends
of the Rappaports.

556
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:10,206
Uh, my name is Roz.
How are you?

557
00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:12,611
Oh, hi.

558
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:14,113
This is Frank.

559
00:26:14,181 --> 00:26:16,945
There's not supposed
to be anybody here.

560
00:26:17,017 --> 00:26:21,613
We're friends
of Dale Jr. And Vivian's.

561
00:26:21,689 --> 00:26:25,819
We go skiing with them
every year in Aspen.

562
00:26:30,331 --> 00:26:32,697
Dale didn't mention
that you were, uh...

563
00:26:32,766 --> 00:26:36,202
Well, it was because
it was so last-minute.

564
00:26:36,270 --> 00:26:39,706
We just... we just got on the phone,
we called Todd.

565
00:26:39,773 --> 00:26:41,070
Todd.

566
00:26:41,141 --> 00:26:44,076
Said, "We'll take care of the place
for the weekend.

567
00:26:44,144 --> 00:26:45,839
Just take your cares
elsewhere."

568
00:26:45,913 --> 00:26:48,848
They were, uh,
they were in, uh...

569
00:26:48,916 --> 00:26:49,848
Chicago.

570
00:26:49,917 --> 00:26:50,781
Chicago. And...

571
00:26:50,851 --> 00:26:53,285
We just saw them up...
we saw them...

572
00:26:53,354 --> 00:26:54,286
At Easter.

573
00:26:54,355 --> 00:26:56,289
Easter. With...
Up in, um...

574
00:26:56,357 --> 00:26:57,289
The cape.

575
00:26:57,358 --> 00:26:59,292
Because, uh,
we had this party.

576
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:00,292
The party.

577
00:27:00,361 --> 00:27:02,295
And Dale was shitfaced.
Remember?

578
00:27:02,363 --> 00:27:03,853
Drunk.

579
00:27:05,199 --> 00:27:08,862
Well, this is propitious.

580
00:27:08,936 --> 00:27:13,270
I'm having a little bash at my place
tomorrow night. Cocktails.

581
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:16,002
Perhaps you'd care
to stop by.

582
00:27:16,076 --> 00:27:19,011
L... I would, uh...
I would love to.

583
00:27:19,079 --> 00:27:22,014
I mean,
if you don't want to.

584
00:27:22,082 --> 00:27:23,515
Sure. No, no.

585
00:27:23,584 --> 00:27:26,610
Frank, you know, he's...
I would love to.

586
00:27:26,687 --> 00:27:28,279
Well, I'll see you
tomorrow night.

587
00:27:28,355 --> 00:27:29,287
O.K.

588
00:27:29,356 --> 00:27:30,288
Good night.

589
00:27:30,357 --> 00:27:32,416
All righty.

590
00:27:33,427 --> 00:27:34,860
Think he's gay?

591
00:27:34,928 --> 00:27:35,917
No.

592
00:27:35,996 --> 00:27:37,429
Look at his pants.

593
00:27:37,498 --> 00:27:40,399
Honey, gay people
wear tight pants.

594
00:27:56,383 --> 00:27:58,544
Here it is.

595
00:27:58,619 --> 00:28:03,056
"Propitious... favorable,
auguring well,

596
00:28:03,123 --> 00:28:05,250
gracious,
and favorably inclined."

597
00:28:05,325 --> 00:28:07,759
You know,
it just means, like...

598
00:28:07,828 --> 00:28:11,127
He could have just said
wicked good.

599
00:28:12,433 --> 00:28:15,027
Oh, my God, honey,
look at this.

600
00:28:15,102 --> 00:28:17,400
This is the painting
that you stole.

601
00:28:17,471 --> 00:28:18,904
Oh, my God.

602
00:28:18,972 --> 00:28:23,136
"Odalisque al... a la...
Cu...

603
00:28:23,210 --> 00:28:24,700
Culottes."

604
00:28:24,778 --> 00:28:26,211
This is
"Culottes."

605
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:27,212
"Rouge."

606
00:28:27,281 --> 00:28:28,714
Oh, my God.

607
00:28:28,782 --> 00:28:29,714
"Henri Matisse,"

608
00:28:29,783 --> 00:28:31,717
the guy
who painted it.

609
00:28:31,785 --> 00:28:33,218
It's pretty old.

610
00:28:33,287 --> 00:28:35,221
This place is nice.
Huh?

611
00:28:35,289 --> 00:28:36,221
Uh-huh.

612
00:28:36,290 --> 00:28:37,222
You know?

613
00:28:37,291 --> 00:28:38,223
Yeah.

614
00:28:38,292 --> 00:28:39,350
This bed...

615
00:28:40,427 --> 00:28:41,792
the books.

616
00:28:44,565 --> 00:28:45,497
The books?

617
00:28:45,566 --> 00:28:48,694
Yeah, the books.
They look nice.

618
00:28:48,769 --> 00:28:49,736
Nice books?

619
00:28:49,803 --> 00:28:52,431
You're always saying
we never go anywhere.

620
00:28:52,506 --> 00:28:54,371
Here we are.

621
00:28:54,441 --> 00:28:56,375
Oh, I know what
you're doing.

622
00:28:56,443 --> 00:28:58,377
I know what
you're doing.

623
00:28:58,445 --> 00:29:00,379
Don't even...
don't even try. Don't even.

624
00:29:00,447 --> 00:29:01,880
Come on, now.

625
00:29:07,054 --> 00:29:07,986
Know what?

626
00:29:08,055 --> 00:29:10,489
I was wrong
about that dye job.

627
00:29:10,557 --> 00:29:11,489
Oh, yeah?

628
00:29:11,558 --> 00:29:13,492
Yeah.
I like the color.

629
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:14,993
All three colors.

630
00:29:15,062 --> 00:29:17,496
Now that I'm lying here
half naked,

631
00:29:17,564 --> 00:29:19,998
it's not so...
what'd you call it... weird?

632
00:29:20,067 --> 00:29:22,501
Is that what
you called it?

633
00:29:22,569 --> 00:29:23,900
That's a horrible thing...

634
00:29:28,609 --> 00:29:29,541
[Giggles]

635
00:29:29,610 --> 00:29:30,542
What?

636
00:29:30,611 --> 00:29:32,545
I don't know.
It's just...

637
00:29:32,613 --> 00:29:35,548
You know, even though
I hate what we do...

638
00:29:35,616 --> 00:29:36,548
Mm-hmm.

639
00:29:36,617 --> 00:29:39,051
You know,
well, what you do.

640
00:29:39,119 --> 00:29:42,054
It's just... sometimes it's just
really exciting.

641
00:29:42,122 --> 00:29:46,058
It's, like, where we are
on the water

642
00:29:46,126 --> 00:29:49,562
and the house
and all the books, great bed.

643
00:29:49,630 --> 00:29:53,566
Great books. We got a great bed
and great books.

644
00:29:53,634 --> 00:29:54,566
Honey.

645
00:29:54,635 --> 00:29:56,398
 ♪ Got a great bed ♪

646
00:29:56,470 --> 00:29:58,062
 ♪ Got a great bed♪

647
00:30:01,108 --> 00:30:03,736
Relax.
I would never hurt you.

648
00:30:03,811 --> 00:30:05,745
You know
what we should do?

649
00:30:05,813 --> 00:30:07,747
We should get out
more often.

650
00:30:07,815 --> 00:30:11,307
We should go to my sister's place
down on Long Island.

651
00:30:11,385 --> 00:30:13,819
We'll have the whole place
to ourselves.

652
00:30:13,887 --> 00:30:16,321
What's the matter?
What do you want?

653
00:30:16,390 --> 00:30:17,379
Kiss me.

654
00:30:22,629 --> 00:30:25,063
Yeah. Get some
of those candles.

655
00:30:25,132 --> 00:30:26,064
Those oils.

656
00:30:26,133 --> 00:30:27,065
Yeah.

657
00:30:27,134 --> 00:30:29,568
Get almond oil.
That's my favorite.

658
00:30:29,636 --> 00:30:31,627
'Cause it tastes
like peanut butter?

659
00:30:33,307 --> 00:30:35,104
And get the...
candles.

660
00:30:37,477 --> 00:30:38,409
Maybe, uh...

661
00:30:38,478 --> 00:30:40,810
maybe we should...

662
00:30:43,050 --> 00:30:43,982
What?

663
00:30:44,051 --> 00:30:45,541
Nothing.

664
00:30:45,619 --> 00:30:49,055
I was just thinking
of this thing I told Jimmy about,

665
00:30:49,122 --> 00:30:50,987
but I can cancel it.

666
00:30:51,058 --> 00:30:52,992
What did you tell Jimmy?

667
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:55,494
No, it was just this thing
with Jimmy.

668
00:30:55,562 --> 00:30:57,496
What did you
tell Jimmy?

669
00:30:57,564 --> 00:30:58,531
Honey, it was nothing.

670
00:30:58,599 --> 00:31:01,033
You said
this was going to be

671
00:31:01,101 --> 00:31:03,569
the last time
that you pull a job like this.

672
00:31:03,637 --> 00:31:06,071
You were
going to pull this job

673
00:31:06,139 --> 00:31:07,834
then go work
for your uncle.

674
00:31:07,908 --> 00:31:09,637
That was the plan,
right?

675
00:31:09,710 --> 00:31:11,143
But, no, it's not...

676
00:31:11,211 --> 00:31:12,576
No?

677
00:31:12,646 --> 00:31:13,578
No?

678
00:31:13,647 --> 00:31:15,478
It's not what
you think it is.

679
00:31:15,549 --> 00:31:17,983
He's got a truckload
of hotel TVs coming in...

680
00:31:18,051 --> 00:31:20,986
I just collect the money.
It's 3 grand.

681
00:31:21,054 --> 00:31:23,488
You say 3,
you come home with 500.

682
00:31:23,557 --> 00:31:24,819
All right,

683
00:31:24,892 --> 00:31:27,827
you were guaranteed
$1,000 with your uncle, honey.

684
00:31:27,895 --> 00:31:29,055
$1,000.

685
00:31:29,129 --> 00:31:33,065
I hate that job.
Plastering walls eight hours a day.

686
00:31:33,133 --> 00:31:36,068
You're either a contractor,
or you are a thief.

687
00:31:36,136 --> 00:31:38,070
You're a contractor
or a thief.

688
00:31:38,138 --> 00:31:40,572
How many thieves you know
got day jobs?

689
00:31:40,641 --> 00:31:42,074
How many you know?

690
00:31:42,142 --> 00:31:43,074
A lot.

691
00:31:43,143 --> 00:31:44,075
Me... Jimmy...

692
00:31:44,144 --> 00:31:45,076
fucking...

693
00:31:45,145 --> 00:31:46,077
Fucking...
Fucking...

694
00:31:46,146 --> 00:31:49,206
Fucking Nicky,
fucking... you suck.

695
00:31:49,283 --> 00:31:51,843
Don't touch me,
all right? You suck.

696
00:31:55,122 --> 00:31:58,148
Honey, all right.

697
00:31:58,225 --> 00:31:59,249
Don't.

698
00:32:02,362 --> 00:32:04,796
You're a cashier
at Barnes and Noble.

699
00:32:04,865 --> 00:32:06,799
It's not like
you're some...

700
00:32:06,867 --> 00:32:09,597
Don't even go there,
all right?

701
00:32:09,670 --> 00:32:11,638
I'm a cashier,
not a thief.

702
00:32:11,705 --> 00:32:12,797
Look.

703
00:32:12,873 --> 00:32:15,967
Look nothing. I don't want
to do this anymore.

704
00:32:16,043 --> 00:32:17,476
What do you want?

705
00:32:17,544 --> 00:32:19,978
We're having this argument,
like, all the time.

706
00:32:20,047 --> 00:32:23,210
You want to know
what I want?

707
00:32:23,283 --> 00:32:25,717
I want a lot
of things.

708
00:32:25,786 --> 00:32:29,222
I want... I would like
to have a house.

709
00:32:29,289 --> 00:32:30,722
We talked about that.

710
00:32:30,791 --> 00:32:33,589
You want me to list
these things off?

711
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:36,094
I'd like kids
and to go to Europe.

712
00:32:36,163 --> 00:32:37,596
Europe? What the fuck?

713
00:32:37,664 --> 00:32:39,598
I'd like
to see Italy.

714
00:32:39,666 --> 00:32:41,327
Italy?
You're fucking Jewish.

715
00:32:43,971 --> 00:32:44,903
What?

716
00:32:44,972 --> 00:32:46,530
Get out.

717
00:32:49,843 --> 00:32:52,209
Look, honey,
let me... let me...

718
00:32:52,279 --> 00:32:54,577
Don't touch me.
Get out.

719
00:32:57,351 --> 00:32:58,784
What happened here?

720
00:32:58,852 --> 00:33:00,342
Don't talk to me.

721
00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:03,480
Is this one of those
hormone things?

722
00:33:08,695 --> 00:33:11,630
Beer? Forget the beer
and get in the car!

723
00:33:11,698 --> 00:33:13,131
Only taking
three cases.

724
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:15,634
That ain't going
to last us till Sunday.

725
00:33:15,702 --> 00:33:17,135
Where's my phone?

726
00:33:17,204 --> 00:33:18,296
In the box.

727
00:33:18,372 --> 00:33:19,600
In the box?

728
00:33:21,375 --> 00:33:22,808
Did your mother
take thalidomide?

729
00:33:22,876 --> 00:33:23,865
When?

730
00:33:24,878 --> 00:33:26,311
Get in the car.

731
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:28,814
Hey, Beano,
Frank is on the phone.

732
00:33:28,882 --> 00:33:31,476
Hey, Fitzie,
come with me.

733
00:33:31,551 --> 00:33:33,985
The French impressionist
painting by Henri Matisse

734
00:33:34,054 --> 00:33:36,386
said to be worth
more than $4 million.

735
00:33:36,456 --> 00:33:39,482
Thieves dumped their car
a few miles from the mansion,

736
00:33:39,559 --> 00:33:41,720
then stole another vehicle
before leading police

737
00:33:41,795 --> 00:33:43,888
on a high-speed
car chase.

738
00:33:43,964 --> 00:33:45,522
High-speed car chase? FBI?

739
00:33:45,599 --> 00:33:47,692
What are you,
Burt Reynolds?

740
00:33:47,768 --> 00:33:54,697
W-what about the $4 million,
Mr... Mr... Mr. L-Liar?

741
00:33:54,775 --> 00:33:57,209
What the guy told me
I told you.

742
00:33:57,277 --> 00:33:58,505
I swear
on my mother's eyes.

743
00:33:58,578 --> 00:34:00,011
Your mother's dead,
Beano.

744
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:03,015
The point is, Frank,
we're going to get more money.

745
00:34:03,083 --> 00:34:06,052
Don't worry. Just stay put.
Where are you?

746
00:34:06,119 --> 00:34:07,643
I don't know.
Some house.

747
00:34:07,721 --> 00:34:09,154
...the past seven years.

748
00:34:09,222 --> 00:34:12,885
18 Beach Road.
Amahonsett.

749
00:34:12,959 --> 00:34:15,393
18 Beach Road.

750
00:34:15,462 --> 00:34:16,429
Got it.

751
00:34:16,496 --> 00:34:21,160
And, Frank, if the FBI
comes down on me...

752
00:34:21,234 --> 00:34:23,668
The FBI's not
going to come down on anybody.

753
00:34:23,737 --> 00:34:25,898
What do they got
to go on?

754
00:34:25,972 --> 00:34:29,408
The only name that checks out
is Beano Callahan.

755
00:34:29,476 --> 00:34:32,411
He's been arrested twice
for fencing stolen goods,

756
00:34:32,479 --> 00:34:34,709
and he's O'Brien's cousin.

757
00:34:36,883 --> 00:34:39,215
It can't be this easy.

758
00:34:39,286 --> 00:34:41,220
O'Malley,
you give me a break.

759
00:34:41,288 --> 00:34:43,722
You expect me
to authorize travel expenses

760
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:46,224
for another Phil the Shill
wild goose chase?

761
00:34:46,293 --> 00:34:47,419
He's dead.

762
00:34:47,494 --> 00:34:50,429
I got information
that the fence is on the move.

763
00:34:50,497 --> 00:34:52,863
I think he'll lead us
to the painting.

764
00:34:52,933 --> 00:34:55,367
You want to go back
to a desk?

765
00:34:55,435 --> 00:34:56,868
No, sir, I don't.

766
00:34:56,937 --> 00:35:00,600
You got till 9 A.M.
Monday morning.

767
00:35:22,229 --> 00:35:24,823
Where's my money,
you asshole?

768
00:35:24,898 --> 00:35:26,195
The 50 bucks!

769
00:35:26,266 --> 00:35:27,460
What are you
talking about?

770
00:35:27,534 --> 00:35:29,468
I work for these people.

771
00:35:29,536 --> 00:35:31,470
I know you're not
supposed to be here,

772
00:35:31,538 --> 00:35:32,971
and you took my money.

773
00:35:33,039 --> 00:35:35,940
If I don't get it back
in three seconds,

774
00:35:36,009 --> 00:35:36,941
I'm calling the cops.

775
00:35:37,010 --> 00:35:38,272
1...

776
00:35:38,345 --> 00:35:39,607
2...

777
00:35:39,679 --> 00:35:40,703
3.

778
00:35:40,780 --> 00:35:46,719
Money's not in my hand.
You blew it big time.

779
00:35:46,786 --> 00:35:49,482
Go ahead.
Call the cops.

780
00:35:49,556 --> 00:35:51,490
See if I care.

781
00:36:13,914 --> 00:36:15,347
Got any I.D.?

782
00:36:15,415 --> 00:36:18,714
Uh... I.D.

783
00:36:18,785 --> 00:36:20,980
Driver's license?

784
00:36:21,054 --> 00:36:25,218
I got a kid over
by Sea Cliff Road

785
00:36:25,292 --> 00:36:28,227
says no one's
supposed to be here.

786
00:36:28,295 --> 00:36:30,320
Which shower did Dale say...
I'm sorry.

787
00:36:30,397 --> 00:36:32,695
I'm sorry, ma'am.

788
00:36:32,766 --> 00:36:34,233
I'm so sorry.

789
00:36:34,301 --> 00:36:35,529
Pardon me.

790
00:36:35,602 --> 00:36:38,628
I didn't know
anyone was here.

791
00:36:38,705 --> 00:36:40,798
We had a report.

792
00:36:40,874 --> 00:36:43,001
Nobody told us.

793
00:36:43,076 --> 00:36:46,307
You know what?
Jeez, that's Dale for you.

794
00:36:46,379 --> 00:36:48,176
Ugh!

795
00:36:48,248 --> 00:36:49,840
Hello.

796
00:36:49,916 --> 00:36:51,178
Hi.

797
00:36:51,251 --> 00:36:52,809
Good morning.

798
00:36:52,886 --> 00:36:55,047
Hello, Herbert.

799
00:36:55,121 --> 00:36:56,349
I see you've met Roz

800
00:36:56,423 --> 00:36:57,355
and, uh...

801
00:36:57,424 --> 00:36:58,356
- Frank.
- Frank.

802
00:36:58,425 --> 00:36:59,551
Frank.

803
00:36:59,626 --> 00:37:01,992
They're here for the weekend.
Is there a problem?

804
00:37:02,062 --> 00:37:04,690
We had a report
there were intruders.

805
00:37:04,764 --> 00:37:06,664
They're friends
of Dale Jr.

806
00:37:07,801 --> 00:37:09,598
Have you caught
that raccoon yet?

807
00:37:10,604 --> 00:37:13,164
We're working on it.

808
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:14,867
Bye-bye.

809
00:37:14,941 --> 00:37:16,135
Bye-bye.

810
00:37:19,145 --> 00:37:22,410
Thought you might like
to go sailing.

811
00:37:22,482 --> 00:37:23,414
Yeah...

812
00:37:23,483 --> 00:37:26,941
Uh, we can't go sailing
because, uh...

813
00:37:27,020 --> 00:37:29,113
Roz hates boats.

814
00:37:30,423 --> 00:37:34,257
Frank, I don't hate boats.
You hate the boats.

815
00:37:36,096 --> 00:37:38,758
I don't hate
the boats.

816
00:37:44,638 --> 00:37:45,570
[Moans]

817
00:37:45,639 --> 00:37:46,799
You O.K.?

818
00:37:46,873 --> 00:37:49,569
Shouldn't have eaten
that celery.

819
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:24,037
Rain Man
and Terminator 2.

820
00:38:30,183 --> 00:38:33,118
Did you ever see
Fast Times at Ridgemont High?

821
00:38:33,186 --> 00:38:34,118
It's great.

822
00:38:34,187 --> 00:38:36,121
Phoebe Cates is in it.

823
00:38:36,189 --> 00:38:37,178
[Laughs]

824
00:38:38,191 --> 00:38:39,624
I need the phone.

825
00:38:39,693 --> 00:38:41,490
I got to go. Bye.

826
00:38:42,996 --> 00:38:43,928
What's up?

827
00:38:43,997 --> 00:38:45,430
You found
the raccoon.

828
00:38:45,498 --> 00:38:49,025
Where's that number
Dale Rappaport left me?

829
00:38:49,102 --> 00:38:50,535
The hotel in Chicago?

830
00:38:50,603 --> 00:38:51,968
What's going on?

831
00:38:52,038 --> 00:38:54,973
I don't know.
Got a hunch, though.

832
00:38:56,576 --> 00:38:59,443
Just remind him
he's overdue on Basic Instinct.

833
00:38:59,512 --> 00:39:02,948
Mr. Dale Rappaport.

834
00:39:03,016 --> 00:39:05,450
Could you ask him
to call Sheriff Horn?

835
00:39:05,518 --> 00:39:07,486
He knows the number.
Thanks. Bye.

836
00:39:11,458 --> 00:39:16,020
Repeat... the car is
a '69 Chrysler Newport.

837
00:39:16,096 --> 00:39:18,462
Maroon with black top.

838
00:39:18,531 --> 00:39:22,023
Massachusetts license

839
00:39:22,102 --> 00:39:23,967
Tango-2-Foxtrot.

840
00:39:24,037 --> 00:39:27,973
They've had this make
since last night. No sign of it yet?

841
00:39:28,041 --> 00:39:31,499
They'd have to be morons
to be still driving that car.

842
00:39:31,578 --> 00:39:34,012
You morons, you want food?
We got food.

843
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:37,015
I'm going to lose control
of my bowels.

844
00:39:37,083 --> 00:39:39,517
I hope this place
is clean.

845
00:39:39,586 --> 00:39:42,521
I don't give a shit.
Look at this.

846
00:39:42,589 --> 00:39:45,023
"Breakfast special...
three eggs, bacon, home fries."

847
00:39:45,091 --> 00:39:46,524
All for 1.99.

848
00:39:46,593 --> 00:39:48,527
You better start
cutting back.

849
00:39:48,595 --> 00:39:51,530
You're going to take
a heart attack.

850
00:39:51,598 --> 00:39:54,829
No butter or mayonnaise.
That's the secret to my health.

851
00:39:54,901 --> 00:39:56,493
Oh, no, Beano.

852
00:39:56,569 --> 00:39:59,766
We ain't eaten in 12 hours.
This is unhumane.

853
00:39:59,839 --> 00:40:02,535
I had my heart
set on eggs.

854
00:40:09,649 --> 00:40:11,082
That was a real pisser.

855
00:40:11,151 --> 00:40:13,585
Tomorrow let's get
our gums scraped.

856
00:40:13,653 --> 00:40:16,121
Tonight, the dress?
How do we dress?

857
00:40:16,189 --> 00:40:18,248
You look great
just as you are.

858
00:40:19,759 --> 00:40:21,192
How about me?

859
00:40:24,097 --> 00:40:27,032
Don't talk to him
like that.

860
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:29,534
I was trying to be nice,

861
00:40:29,602 --> 00:40:31,365
and you're throwing
attitude around.

862
00:40:31,438 --> 00:40:33,372
I think
he's a gentleman.

863
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:35,408
I think
he's an asshole.

864
00:40:35,475 --> 00:40:36,635
I want my money!

865
00:40:36,709 --> 00:40:38,802
Jesus Christ,
who is this person?

866
00:40:39,813 --> 00:40:41,678
Wow.
How'd you do that?

867
00:40:46,986 --> 00:40:48,419
Who was that?

868
00:40:48,488 --> 00:40:49,420
Todd.

869
00:40:49,489 --> 00:40:50,854
That is Todd?

870
00:40:50,924 --> 00:40:53,358
Yeah. You want
to have kids?

871
00:40:53,426 --> 00:40:55,360
Not like Todd,
I don't.

872
00:40:55,428 --> 00:40:56,793
Kids today are on crack.

873
00:40:56,863 --> 00:40:58,797
I don't want anybody
stopping them.

874
00:40:58,865 --> 00:41:00,298
We need
a clear path.

875
00:41:00,366 --> 00:41:02,800
You're not going
to stop them?

876
00:41:02,869 --> 00:41:06,305
Do you have any idea
how much that car is worth?

877
00:41:06,372 --> 00:41:10,308
I know people!
My husband's a lawyer!

878
00:41:10,376 --> 00:41:12,469
There better not be
a scratch on it.

879
00:41:23,089 --> 00:41:26,024
Maybe we shouldn't go
to this party tonight,

880
00:41:26,092 --> 00:41:27,081

a pretty good time on your own.

Huh?

00:59:48,621 --> 00:59:51,454
So, uh... when'd you
learn how to fish?

1266
00:59:52,958 --> 00:59:55,825
ESPN, you know.
They got a fishing show.

1267
00:59:55,895 --> 00:59:58,762
It's, like, a wrist thing.
It's, like, a little whip.

1268
01:00:04,804 --> 01:00:08,103
Must've been a...
bottom feeder.

1269
01:00:09,308 --> 01:00:12,436
So... um...
how's the painting going?

1270
01:00:12,511 --> 01:00:15,947
Good. L... I think
I'm, uh, finished... I think.

1271
01:00:16,015 --> 01:00:16,947
Yeah?

1272
01:00:17,016 --> 01:00:18,005
Mm-hmm.

1273
01:00:18,084 --> 01:00:19,608
Well...

1274

No.

1277

Come on.

1278
01:00:25,257 --> 01:00:26,189
Please?

1279

You really
want to see it?

1280
01:00:28,260 --> 01:00:30,194
Yeah. I mean,
you know. Um...

1281

Wow. It's, um...

1284
01:00:52,785 --> 01:00:54,377
it's unbelievable. L...

painted this.

Yeah.

Wow.

1289

It's, uh...

1290
01:01:02,061 --> 01:01:04,495
I know, I know.
I really surprised myself.

1291
01:01:04,563 --> 01:01:06,087
Yeah, I'll bet.

1292
01:01:06,165 --> 01:01:07,598
It's a boat, right?

1293
01:01:07,666 --> 01:01:08,598
Mm-hmm.

1294
01:01:08,667 --> 01:01:11,101
I like the, um...
blues and the, uh...

1295

1296
01:01:12,471 --> 01:01:13,995
It's very, um...

1297
01:01:15,474 --> 01:01:16,600
Messy.

1298
01:01:19,478 --> 01:01:21,912
Well, that's not...
that's not the point.

1299
01:01:21,981 --> 01:01:24,609
The point is, how does it
make you feel?

1300
01:01:24,683 --> 01:01:26,651
Well, it, um...

1301
01:01:28,320 --> 01:01:31,687
makes me feel like l...
I wish it was...

1302
01:01:31,757 --> 01:01:33,224
a little, um... neater.

1303
01:01:33,292 --> 01:01:36,693
Well, this is my point of view.
This is how I see it.

1304
01:01:36,762 --> 01:01:38,696
If that's
your point of view,

1305
01:01:38,764 --> 01:01:40,732
maybe you should
get some... glasses.

1306
01:01:41,767 --> 01:01:43,029
L... I'm... O.K., wait.

1307

Sit down and
have some fish.

1308
01:01:45,104 --> 01:01:46,594

You are narrow-minded.

1311

You always see things
the same way.

1312
01:02:00,286 --> 01:02:02,948
That's why your life
is never going to change.

1313
01:02:03,956 --> 01:02:06,390
Right. And... and you're
a whole new person

1314
01:02:06,459 --> 01:02:09,986
just 'cause you slapped some paint
on a piece of cloth?

1315
01:02:10,062 --> 01:02:12,656
No. At least I want
to try new things.

1316
01:02:12,731 --> 01:02:15,165
I want to meet
new people. At least...

1317
01:02:15,234 --> 01:02:17,668
All you ever do
is go to Breen's

1318
01:02:17,736 --> 01:02:20,671
and get drunk with Tommy O'Shannahan,
and you guys gamble.

1319

That's all you do.

go out with my friends?

You know,
you always do this.

You start one argument,

1323

and then in the middle,
you shift gea...

1324

and then suddenly

1325

- we're talking about your friends.
- And?

1326
01:02:34,753 --> 01:02:35,845
It doesn't make sense.

1327

It makes perfect sense,
Frank.

1328
01:02:37,923 --> 01:02:40,357
It makes perfect sense
to me.

1329
01:02:40,426 --> 01:02:41,358
It does?

1330

Yeah.

1331

you know, change overnight?

you take, like,

1340
01:02:59,912 --> 01:03:02,346
a... a night course at
some community college

1341
01:03:02,414 --> 01:03:05,008
that that... like that's
going to make you different.

Well, it doesn't,
Roz, O.K.?

1343

All right?

1344

You know, we're not
like these people.

never going to have.

1346

They have these houses. They have boats.
They have foreign cars.

in the bank.

1353
01:03:32,278 --> 01:03:35,042
we don't even win the lottery,
for Christ's sake.

1354
01:03:37,583 --> 01:03:39,175
We're born
in little houses,

1355
01:03:39,251 --> 01:03:41,185
and we die
in little houses,

1356
01:03:41,253 --> 01:03:44,552
and... we got to find happiness
somewhere in between.

1357

Well, Frank, if you want to die
in your little house,

1358
01:03:54,033 --> 01:03:57,025
you go right ahead, but I got
bigger things planned.

What... l... what I was
trying to say...

1365
01:04:08,781 --> 01:04:11,215
Frank... I'm not blaming you,
all right?

1366
01:04:11,283 --> 01:04:13,217
I'm blaming me.
I'm blaming me,

1367
01:04:13,285 --> 01:04:15,719
because I knew that three,
four years ago,

1368
01:04:15,788 --> 01:04:17,380
what I wanted
from life

1369
01:04:17,456 --> 01:04:19,890
was completely different from
what you wanted...

1370
01:04:19,959 --> 01:04:21,893
but every time
I'd try to go,

1371
01:04:21,961 --> 01:04:23,553
you'd do something
absolutely great,

1372
01:04:23,629 --> 01:04:25,722
and I wouldn't
know how to go,

1373
01:04:25,798 --> 01:04:28,733
and now it's made it
all that much harder for me,

I can't anymore.

Never sat

O.K., O.K.

That's it.

Move around.

1444
01:07:52,471 --> 01:07:55,065
So I don't really understand
the point of this.

1445
01:07:55,140 --> 01:07:57,574
Are we trying
to bore him to death?

1446
01:07:57,643 --> 01:07:59,406
Is that
the goal here?

1447
01:07:59,478 --> 01:08:01,912
No, you're just trying
to exercise the horse.

1448
01:08:01,980 --> 01:08:03,470
And do wha...

1449
01:08:05,584 --> 01:08:07,017
Mmm. Mmm.

Um...

1454
01:08:17,429 --> 01:08:19,363

1456
01:08:20,766 --> 01:08:22,700
I guess.
Uh...

you're with the same guy
so many years,

01:08:27,105 --> 01:08:28,697
Kind of puts
a wrench

01:08:28,774 --> 01:08:30,298
in the old thing

01:09:43,248 --> 01:09:44,180
Stop it.

That's it. Look.

What?

1478
01:09:47,019 --> 01:09:48,953
- It's that painting.
- So?

1479
01:09:49,021 --> 01:09:51,455
So it's stolen.
Guy's an art thief.

first time I met him.

This island's great.
Fresh air, and it's so quiet.

1483
01:09:58,597 --> 01:10:00,189
We should get
some mopeds.

01:10:00,265 --> 01:10:01,857
That ferry
made me queasy.

1485

going to puke.

Hey, kid.
Do me a favor?

What you've done

O.K., so?

Oh, Frank. I've seen...

I've seen a thousand
Mona Lisas,

that they were stolen.

Fine. I fell myself.

Could you tell us where
there's a fish plant?

Uh, yes, but it's
been closed,

lifting with your back.

to bend at the knees.

this herniated disk.

1617
01:16:32,590 --> 01:16:34,319
Ex-girlfriend,
thank you.

1618
01:16:34,392 --> 01:16:35,791
Eh?

1619
01:16:35,860 --> 01:16:38,852
Come on. Give me it.
I don't want to hurt you.

1620
01:16:38,930 --> 01:16:39,862
No, no.

1621
01:16:39,931 --> 01:16:41,364
Give it, give it!

1622
01:16:41,433 --> 01:16:42,730
Give it to me!

1623
01:16:42,801 --> 01:16:44,063
Give it back!

1624
01:16:44,135 --> 01:16:45,067
Careful. Careful.

1625
01:16:45,136 --> 01:16:46,660
It's a priceless
masterpiece.

1626
01:16:46,738 --> 01:16:48,672
[Gunshot]

1627
01:16:48,740 --> 01:16:49,866
Holy shit!

1628
01:16:51,142 --> 01:16:52,507
What was that?

1629
01:16:52,577 --> 01:16:54,010
Sounded like a gunshot.

1630
01:16:54,079 --> 01:16:58,038
You think we should
go help Beano?

1631
01:16:58,116 --> 01:17:00,516
[Tires Squealing]

1632
01:17:02,754 --> 01:17:04,745
[Everyone Coughing]

1633
01:17:06,658 --> 01:17:08,091
Where's the painting?

1634
01:17:08,159 --> 01:17:09,649
Aw. Don't tell me...

1635
01:17:10,862 --> 01:17:12,693
Hey. Somebody's coming.

1636
01:17:12,764 --> 01:17:14,197
[Beano]
Must be the buyer.

1637
01:17:14,265 --> 01:17:16,028
[Roz]
Frank, I'm blind. Frank?

1638
01:17:16,101 --> 01:17:18,194
[Beano]
Frank, I'm going to kill you.

1639
01:17:18,269 --> 01:17:20,294
Frank, he locked the door.

1640
01:17:20,372 --> 01:17:22,567
[Beano]
Oh, get Frank to open it.

1641
01:17:22,640 --> 01:17:24,073
He's good
at that stuff.

1642
01:17:24,142 --> 01:17:25,131
[Roz]
Go on.

1643
01:17:26,144 --> 01:17:28,112
[Coughing]

1644
01:17:30,382 --> 01:17:31,644
[Beano]
Move it, move it!

1645
01:17:31,716 --> 01:17:32,648
It's raining.

1646
01:17:32,717 --> 01:17:34,150
[Beano]
So what?

1647
01:17:34,219 --> 01:17:35,151
O.K. O.K.

1648
01:17:35,220 --> 01:17:37,211
[Coughing]

1649
01:17:40,258 --> 01:17:42,249
This is way too easy.

1650
01:17:42,327 --> 01:17:44,921
Once again,
I do not know this man.

1651
01:17:44,996 --> 01:17:48,363
I do not know nothing
about no stolen painting.

1652
01:17:48,433 --> 01:17:50,867
I am a businessman
from Boston

1653
01:17:50,935 --> 01:17:52,425
here on vacation

1654
01:17:52,504 --> 01:17:54,062
on this
beautiful island.

1655
01:17:56,207 --> 01:17:57,196
Put him back
in the cell.

1656
01:17:58,309 --> 01:18:00,903
[Beano]
I want a lawyer. I know my rights.

1657
01:18:00,979 --> 01:18:01,911
Ooh!

1658
01:18:01,980 --> 01:18:03,675
Take it easy with him.

1659
01:18:03,748 --> 01:18:05,739
Bring the woman out.

1660
01:18:07,585 --> 01:18:10,520
I'm going to remind you
that you may, if you wish,

1661
01:18:10,588 --> 01:18:12,021
have legal counsel
present.

1662
01:18:12,090 --> 01:18:13,523
If you answer
my questions...

1663
01:18:13,591 --> 01:18:15,024
Leave her out of it.

1664
01:18:15,093 --> 01:18:16,526
You shut up.

1665
01:18:17,695 --> 01:18:19,629
Your cooperation
will be noted,

1666
01:18:19,697 --> 01:18:21,426
blah, blah, blah,
blah, blah.

1667
01:18:21,499 --> 01:18:22,591
Now...

1668
01:18:22,667 --> 01:18:24,134
what did you do
with that painting?

1669
01:18:26,171 --> 01:18:28,537
You can make this
easy on yourself.

1670
01:18:28,606 --> 01:18:30,403
Where is the painting?

1671
01:18:31,409 --> 01:18:34,037
O.K. Fine.

1672
01:18:34,112 --> 01:18:36,046
What were you doing
in a fish plant?

1673
01:18:36,114 --> 01:18:37,547
She doesn't
know anything.

1674
01:18:37,615 --> 01:18:40,607
I told you to shut up,
goddamn it!

1675
01:18:45,156 --> 01:18:46,783
[O'Malley]
Sweetheart...

1676
01:18:47,892 --> 01:18:50,827
I've seen guys like this
all my life.

1677
01:18:50,895 --> 01:18:53,386
They're all headed
for the same place.

1678
01:18:53,465 --> 01:18:56,662
Spending his life pulling
these nickel-and-dime jobs,

1679
01:18:56,734 --> 01:18:58,565
waiting for
the big payday.

1680
01:18:58,636 --> 01:19:00,536
Well...

1681
01:19:00,605 --> 01:19:02,505
this is it.

1682
01:19:02,574 --> 01:19:04,007
The big score.

1683
01:19:04,075 --> 01:19:05,565
Huh?

1684
01:19:05,643 --> 01:19:07,577
Welcome to easy street.

1685
01:19:10,014 --> 01:19:12,346
[O'Malley]
Well, listen to me.

1686
01:19:12,417 --> 01:19:14,851
You can piss
your life away

1687
01:19:14,919 --> 01:19:17,479
on a small-time loser
like this,

1688
01:19:17,555 --> 01:19:18,988
or you can do

1689
01:19:19,057 --> 01:19:21,355
what you know
is the right thing.

1690
01:19:21,426 --> 01:19:23,917
Now, what do you say,
huh?

1691
01:19:31,870 --> 01:19:33,804
[O'Malley]
Hmm?

1692
01:19:33,872 --> 01:19:36,397
What are you
going to do?

1693
01:19:38,776 --> 01:19:40,403
I did it.

1694
01:19:42,914 --> 01:19:44,848
I stole the painting.

1695
01:19:45,950 --> 01:19:48,316
Roz had nothing
to do with it.

1696
01:19:48,386 --> 01:19:50,047
She's too smart.

1697
01:19:51,789 --> 01:19:54,724
Actually, she tried
to talk me out of it,

1698
01:19:54,792 --> 01:19:56,225
but I wouldn't listen.

1699
01:19:56,294 --> 01:19:57,352
So...

1700
01:19:57,428 --> 01:19:59,862
I stole the painting
and, uh,

1701
01:19:59,931 --> 01:20:02,627
Beano set everything up
with the buyer,

1702
01:20:02,700 --> 01:20:04,634
and then the buyer
ripped us off

1703
01:20:04,702 --> 01:20:06,067
at the fish plant.

1704
01:20:06,137 --> 01:20:07,570
You blabbermouth!

1705
01:20:07,639 --> 01:20:09,072
Ooh!
Ow-ow!

1706
01:20:09,140 --> 01:20:10,607
[O'Malley]
I still don't have

1707
01:20:10,675 --> 01:20:12,905
the painting
or the buyer.

1708
01:20:12,977 --> 01:20:15,275
Well...

1709
01:20:15,346 --> 01:20:16,938
if she walks,

1710
01:20:17,015 --> 01:20:19,449
I can get you
the painting

1711
01:20:19,517 --> 01:20:22,077
and the guy
who bought it.

1712
01:20:22,153 --> 01:20:24,087
[Tires Squealing]

1713
01:20:24,155 --> 01:20:26,146
[Siren]

1714
01:20:35,600 --> 01:20:37,295
This is really bad.

1715
01:20:38,469 --> 01:20:40,937
Hey. Why don't we
do like a...

1716
01:20:41,005 --> 01:20:42,768
like a jailbreak?

1717
01:20:42,840 --> 01:20:45,104
You know, like in
the cowboy movies?

1718
01:20:45,176 --> 01:20:46,609
You know, we could
get a rope,

1719
01:20:46,678 --> 01:20:49,203
tie it to the bars,
then pull out.

1720
01:20:49,280 --> 01:20:51,214
Beano could come out
the window.

1721
01:20:51,282 --> 01:20:53,876
Did your parents
hold you underwater a lot

1722
01:20:53,952 --> 01:20:55,385
when you were
a baby?

1723
01:20:55,453 --> 01:20:56,715
Jesus.

1724
01:20:56,788 --> 01:20:59,222
Well, you have
a better idea?

1725
01:20:59,290 --> 01:21:00,951
You know...

1726
01:21:01,025 --> 01:21:02,720
I've had
just about enough.

1727
01:21:02,794 --> 01:21:04,227
Enough of you.

1728
01:21:04,295 --> 01:21:07,230
Enough of your
disgusting habits.

1729
01:21:07,298 --> 01:21:09,732
I ask you not to curse,
you curse.

1730
01:21:09,801 --> 01:21:10,733
Fuck you!

1731
01:21:10,802 --> 01:21:13,396
I ask you not to smoke,
you smoke.

1732
01:21:13,471 --> 01:21:16,372
I ask you not to pass gas,
all you do...

1733
01:21:16,441 --> 01:21:17,373
Pffllt! Pfft!

1734
01:21:17,442 --> 01:21:19,376
Hey, I got
a gastrotestical

1735
01:21:19,444 --> 01:21:21,105
intestinal disease,
man!

1736
01:21:21,179 --> 01:21:22,806
The question is...

1737
01:21:23,815 --> 01:21:26,215
what would Beano do?

1738
01:21:26,284 --> 01:21:28,752
[Kelly]
He'd be thinking of his own ass

1739
01:21:28,820 --> 01:21:31,948
and getting out of here
as soon as he could.

1740
01:21:32,023 --> 01:21:33,354
This is ridiculous.

1741
01:21:33,424 --> 01:21:36,689
Mr. Marsh is a highly
respected resident.

1742
01:21:36,761 --> 01:21:38,695
You can't barge in
without a warrant.

1743
01:21:38,763 --> 01:21:41,027
I'll do whatever
the fuck I want.

1744
01:21:41,099 --> 01:21:42,532
I'm the goddamn FBI.

1745
01:21:42,600 --> 01:21:45,592
Take me to the door,
man, and shut up.

1746
01:21:47,305 --> 01:21:48,567
Your call.

1747
01:21:48,640 --> 01:21:50,198
Princess Caraboo
or Gremlins.

1748
01:21:54,646 --> 01:21:56,045
Hello there.

1749
01:21:56,114 --> 01:21:58,548
Sorry to disturb you,
Mr. Marsh.

1750
01:21:58,616 --> 01:22:00,208
Agent O'Malley, FBI.

1751
01:22:00,284 --> 01:22:01,717
We're investigating
the theft of a painting

1752
01:22:01,786 --> 01:22:04,380
in Rhode Island
a couple of days ago.

1753
01:22:04,455 --> 01:22:07,049
I wonder if you could
let us in

1754
01:22:07,125 --> 01:22:09,389
for a quick look
around your house.

1755
01:22:09,460 --> 01:22:10,722
Uh... yeah.

1756
01:22:10,795 --> 01:22:12,228
I don't understand.

1757
01:22:12,296 --> 01:22:14,890
Where do I fit
into all this?

1758
01:22:14,966 --> 01:22:16,399
At this stage,
you don't.

1759
01:22:16,467 --> 01:22:18,935
We'd like to eliminate
any likely possibilities.

1760
01:22:22,006 --> 01:22:24,236
It's not there.
It was right there.

1761
01:22:24,308 --> 01:22:26,242
I saw on the videotape.

1762
01:22:26,310 --> 01:22:27,743
Mm-hmm. Right.

1763
01:22:27,812 --> 01:22:30,372
It's got to be here.

1764
01:22:30,448 --> 01:22:31,380
O.K., Frank.

1765
01:22:31,449 --> 01:22:33,383
I've had enough
of this bullshit.

1766
01:22:33,451 --> 01:22:34,884
I'm taking you...

1767
01:22:34,952 --> 01:22:36,943
Frank, come on,
man! Frank!

1768
01:22:37,021 --> 01:22:38,488
Frank!

1769
01:22:42,093 --> 01:22:43,685
Frank, what are you doing?

1770
01:22:43,761 --> 01:22:45,695
You're not getting away,
you know.

1771
01:22:45,763 --> 01:22:47,697
There's no way
out of here.

1772
01:22:47,765 --> 01:22:49,699
[Frank]
Shit. Not in there.

1773
01:22:49,767 --> 01:22:51,701
I'm not trying
to get away.

1774
01:22:51,769 --> 01:22:53,100
I'm looking, O.K.?

1775
01:22:53,171 --> 01:22:56,163
Do I look like
I'm trying to get away?

1776
01:23:01,412 --> 01:23:03,039
Uh-huh.

1777
01:23:03,114 --> 01:23:04,376
- Wow.
- [Frank] See?

1778
01:23:04,449 --> 01:23:05,882
[Burke]
They're all here, sir.

1779
01:23:05,950 --> 01:23:07,315
[Frank]
What'd I tell you?

1780
01:23:19,630 --> 01:23:21,621
[Wall Creaks]

1781
01:23:26,304 --> 01:23:28,738
[O'Malley]
If I missed my guess...

1782
01:23:28,806 --> 01:23:31,400
Mmm. A Matisse...

1783
01:23:32,744 --> 01:23:34,837
[O'Malley]
Hmm.

1784
01:23:59,337 --> 01:24:01,271
[O'Malley]
Hmm.

1785
01:24:01,339 --> 01:24:04,069
[Chuckling]

1786
01:24:04,142 --> 01:24:05,973
Shit.

1787
01:24:06,043 --> 01:24:08,273
Ha ha ha ha ha.

1788
01:24:10,281 --> 01:24:11,771
Reproductions.

1789
01:24:11,849 --> 01:24:13,214
Well, yes.

1790
01:24:13,284 --> 01:24:15,275
What did you expect?

1791
01:24:16,721 --> 01:24:18,382
Mind leaving
my house now?

1792
01:24:40,077 --> 01:24:42,409
Nice plastering job,
nimrod.

1793
01:24:49,754 --> 01:24:51,915
[O'Malley]
Oh, yes.

1794
01:24:51,989 --> 01:24:53,422
These are real.

1795
01:24:53,491 --> 01:24:55,083
Congratulations, sir.
You've done it.

1796
01:24:55,159 --> 01:24:56,751
You're something else,
honey.

1797
01:24:57,829 --> 01:24:59,694
Jeffrey.

1798
01:24:59,764 --> 01:25:01,231
I need you now.

1799
01:25:01,299 --> 01:25:02,732
I need you now!

1800
01:25:02,800 --> 01:25:06,201
Get here now,
or I get another lawyer.

1801
01:25:06,270 --> 01:25:07,760
I'm getting
another lawyer.

1802
01:25:12,276 --> 01:25:15,268
This isn't a problem.
I can get out of this.

1803
01:25:16,447 --> 01:25:17,914
You are amazing.

1804
01:25:17,982 --> 01:25:20,917
You are an amazing
piece of garbage, you know that?

1805
01:25:20,985 --> 01:25:22,714
You are. You know what?

1806
01:25:22,787 --> 01:25:24,618
You're worse than Beano
and McFadden

1807
01:25:24,689 --> 01:25:25,951
and all those guys.

1808
01:25:26,023 --> 01:25:27,456
You know why?

1809
01:25:27,525 --> 01:25:29,789
Because they might be
liars, deadbeats, and scumbags,

1810
01:25:29,861 --> 01:25:32,625
but they'd never pretend to be
anything they're not.

1811
01:25:32,697 --> 01:25:34,062
Know what your
problem is?

1812
01:25:34,131 --> 01:25:35,189
What?

1813
01:25:35,266 --> 01:25:37,700
I get a lot of girls

1814
01:25:37,768 --> 01:25:40,032
want to fuck their way
into all this,

1815
01:25:40,104 --> 01:25:41,366
but I liked you...

1816
01:25:41,439 --> 01:25:43,703
but you don't know
what you want.

1817
01:25:43,774 --> 01:25:47,938
So, you're stuck with
your deadbeat moron of a boyfriend.

1818
01:25:50,081 --> 01:25:51,708
I'm sorry, excuse me?

1819
01:25:51,782 --> 01:25:53,443
Your boyfriend,
what's his name?

1820
01:25:56,254 --> 01:25:57,744
His name is Frank!

1821
01:26:00,558 --> 01:26:03,527
Why can't people
remember that name?

1822
01:26:07,265 --> 01:26:09,199
What did you
hit him with?

1823
01:26:09,267 --> 01:26:11,132
Um, right hook.

1824
01:26:13,471 --> 01:26:15,336
So...

1825
01:26:15,406 --> 01:26:17,465
how propitious.

1826
01:26:20,011 --> 01:26:21,945
[O'Malley]
I had a hunch once.

1827
01:26:22,013 --> 01:26:24,174
A guy robbed
an art museum

1828
01:26:24,248 --> 01:26:26,182
then faked
his own death.

1829
01:26:26,250 --> 01:26:28,150
No suspects...

1830
01:26:28,219 --> 01:26:29,811
no evidence...

1831
01:26:29,887 --> 01:26:32,481
the paintings
never even turned up.

1832
01:26:32,556 --> 01:26:35,821
Burke, put Phil the Shill
in the car.

1833
01:26:35,893 --> 01:26:38,123
Yes, sir.
Come on, loser.

1834
01:26:44,902 --> 01:26:46,199
Sheriff.

1835
01:26:46,270 --> 01:26:47,669
Uncuff them.

1836
01:26:47,738 --> 01:26:49,228
You got to be kidding.

1837
01:26:49,307 --> 01:26:51,138
No. We're letting
them go.

1838
01:26:55,246 --> 01:26:57,680
I ought to put you
on the payroll.

1839
01:26:57,748 --> 01:26:59,943
O.K. Here's the deal.

1840
01:27:00,017 --> 01:27:01,951
You agree to make
a statement

1841
01:27:02,019 --> 01:27:03,452
and testify in court,

1842
01:27:03,521 --> 01:27:06,354
and we'll drop all
the charges against you.

1843
01:27:07,558 --> 01:27:09,992
Here's my card.

1844
01:27:10,061 --> 01:27:11,892
9:00 tomorrow morning...

1845
01:27:13,130 --> 01:27:14,722
pal.

1846
01:27:15,833 --> 01:27:17,300
[Roz] Thank you.
We'll be there.

1847
01:27:17,368 --> 01:27:19,199
That means up
at like 7:00.

1848
01:27:19,270 --> 01:27:20,703
How's 10:00?

1849
01:27:21,806 --> 01:27:23,330
Frank. Frank.

1850
01:27:23,407 --> 01:27:24,704
The way you work,

1851
01:27:24,775 --> 01:27:28,211
you might as well
be wearing a badge.

1852
01:27:28,279 --> 01:27:29,712
I think
you'd make

1853
01:27:29,780 --> 01:27:31,145
a very handsome
cop.

1854
01:27:31,215 --> 01:27:33,649
[Giggling]

1855
01:27:33,718 --> 01:27:35,185
Honey.

1856
01:27:37,154 --> 01:27:39,588
The key
to catching eggs...

1857
01:27:39,657 --> 01:27:40,589
O.K.

1858
01:27:40,658 --> 01:27:42,091
Is soft hands, O.K.?

1859
01:27:42,159 --> 01:27:44,150
That's all you
got to remember.

1860
01:27:44,228 --> 01:27:45,195
Soft hands.

1861
01:27:45,262 --> 01:27:47,822
You know Jerry Rice...
plays for the 49ers?

1862
01:27:47,898 --> 01:27:48,830
Um, yeah.

1863
01:27:48,899 --> 01:27:50,833
You know how he catches?

1864
01:27:50,901 --> 01:27:53,495
Even on a bullet pass.
Nice, soft hands.

1865
01:27:53,571 --> 01:27:55,004
Let it drop. Ready?

1866
01:27:55,072 --> 01:27:56,198
- O.K.
- O.K.

1867
01:27:57,408 --> 01:27:58,340
Got it.

1868
01:27:58,409 --> 01:28:00,343
Not bad. Not bad.

1869
01:28:00,411 --> 01:28:01,901
O.K. I'm ready.

1870
01:28:03,614 --> 01:28:05,047
[Frank]
Now, underhanded.

1871
01:28:05,116 --> 01:28:07,050
We need to get
a higher one.

1872
01:28:07,118 --> 01:28:09,416
Nice high one.
It's harder. Ready?

1873
01:28:12,723 --> 01:28:13,655
Oh.

1874
01:28:13,724 --> 01:28:15,624
[Frank Laughing]

1875
01:28:15,693 --> 01:28:17,126
Ugh.

1876
01:28:17,194 --> 01:28:19,059
[Frank]
Yup.

1877
01:28:19,130 --> 01:28:20,062
Coming back?

1878
01:28:20,131 --> 01:28:21,860
Got to keep
working on it.

1879
01:28:21,932 --> 01:28:22,864
Coming back?

1880
01:28:22,933 --> 01:28:24,366
I don't think so.

1881
01:28:24,435 --> 01:28:25,868
But, uh, who knows?

1882
01:28:25,936 --> 01:28:27,870
Maybe, if you're
ever in Boston,

1883
01:28:27,938 --> 01:28:29,701
you can come
visit us.

1884
01:28:29,774 --> 01:28:31,969
Yeah. That'd be great.

1885
01:28:32,043 --> 01:28:34,978
So, I was thinking
that tomorrow morning

1886
01:28:35,046 --> 01:28:36,980
after we do
this FBI stuff,

1887
01:28:37,048 --> 01:28:40,643
we could go down to
your sister's place, you know?

1888
01:28:40,718 --> 01:28:42,652
Make a weekend
out of it.

1889
01:28:42,720 --> 01:28:44,153
A little sun...

1890
01:28:44,221 --> 01:28:45,711
a little surf.

1891
01:28:48,025 --> 01:28:49,720
What?

1892
01:28:54,732 --> 01:28:56,666
Do you love me, Frank?

1893
01:28:56,734 --> 01:28:58,258
Of course I do.

1894
01:28:59,303 --> 01:29:01,237
All right, then raise
your right hand.

1895
01:29:01,305 --> 01:29:02,897
What do you mean?

1896
01:29:02,973 --> 01:29:04,133
Do it.

1897
01:29:05,876 --> 01:29:07,138
Like this?

1898
01:29:07,211 --> 01:29:09,202
Yeah. Thank you
very much.

1899
01:29:10,448 --> 01:29:12,109
Now repeat after me.

1900
01:29:12,183 --> 01:29:14,549
I, Francis Michael
O'Brien...

1901
01:29:14,618 --> 01:29:17,587
I, Frank O'Brien...

1902
01:29:17,655 --> 01:29:18,587
swear...

1903
01:29:18,656 --> 01:29:19,588
swear...

1904
01:29:19,657 --> 01:29:22,558
that I will
get a job...

1905
01:29:22,626 --> 01:29:24,184
pay taxes,
and settle down

1906
01:29:24,261 --> 01:29:26,195
like a normal
human being.

1907
01:29:26,263 --> 01:29:27,662
What kind of job?

1908
01:29:27,731 --> 01:29:28,663
Bye-bye.

1909
01:29:28,732 --> 01:29:30,029
O.K., O.K.

1910
01:29:30,101 --> 01:29:32,035
[Sighs]

1911
01:29:32,103 --> 01:29:35,095
I swear I will
get a job.

1912
01:29:36,307 --> 01:29:37,774
O.K.?

1913
01:29:38,943 --> 01:29:40,376
Promise.

1914
01:29:40,444 --> 01:29:41,877
And quit smoking?

1915
01:29:41,946 --> 01:29:43,379
Honey,
I quit smoking.

1916
01:29:43,447 --> 01:29:44,880
- Bye-bye.
- O.K., O.K.

1917
01:29:44,949 --> 01:29:46,109
I will...

1918
01:29:47,351 --> 01:29:48,283
"I will..."
I can't hear you.

1919
01:29:48,352 --> 01:29:51,287
I swear I will
quit smoking.

1920
01:29:51,355 --> 01:29:52,788
On your mother's eyes?

1921
01:29:52,857 --> 01:29:54,757
Honey, unh...

1922
01:29:55,793 --> 01:29:57,317
O.K.

1923
01:29:57,394 --> 01:29:59,828
I swear
on my mother's eyes

1924
01:29:59,897 --> 01:30:02,229
that I will do
all the things

1925
01:30:02,299 --> 01:30:04,824
that you just
asked me to do.

1926
01:30:07,304 --> 01:30:09,204
What?

1927
01:30:10,207 --> 01:30:11,606
What?

1928
01:30:13,477 --> 01:30:15,172
[Roz]
Sweetie.

1929
01:30:22,153 --> 01:30:23,415
[Frank]
O.K., sweetie...

1930
01:30:23,487 --> 01:30:24,419
Ha ha.

1931
01:30:24,488 --> 01:30:27,480
[Roz] No need to see...
just kiss me.

1932
01:30:30,227 --> 01:30:33,094
