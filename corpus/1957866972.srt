1
00:02:04,857 --> 00:02:07,393
What's wrong with the Internet?

2
00:02:07,426 --> 00:02:09,229
I don't know.

3
00:02:16,335 --> 00:02:17,904
Can't sleep?

4
00:02:20,306 --> 00:02:21,908
You got to try.

5
00:02:25,711 --> 00:02:30,817
- I found something today.
- Yeah? What did you find?

6
00:02:32,618 --> 00:02:34,554
Is it real?

7
00:02:38,891 --> 00:02:41,161
- Put that down.
- Why?

8
00:04:53,892 --> 00:04:56,796
I am calling you right back.
I'm in the bath.

9
00:04:58,797 --> 00:05:01,000
Man, stop fucking with me.

10
00:05:05,637 --> 00:05:07,807
Stop fucking with me.

11
00:05:10,642 --> 00:05:12,979
They're sending a car right now?

12
00:05:20,519 --> 00:05:22,322
Holy shit.

13
00:06:17,709 --> 00:06:19,479
Sorry.

14
00:06:23,715 --> 00:06:25,484
Should be good now.

15
00:06:25,517 --> 00:06:26,986
Cool.

16
00:06:27,019 --> 00:06:28,954
Uh, y'all got, like,
a track or something

17
00:06:28,987 --> 00:06:32,591
that you want me
to try something over?

18
00:06:32,624 --> 00:06:33,893
Uh, just wait on him.

19
00:06:33,926 --> 00:06:34,961
Okay.

20
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:44,637
Doesn't it feel like
we're in a movie?

21
00:06:45,737 --> 00:06:47,974
Uh...

22
00:07:05,991 --> 00:07:07,927
I'm Cole.

23
00:07:10,062 --> 00:07:11,997
Thanks for coming tonight.

24
00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:14,633
Yeah, of course.

25
00:07:14,666 --> 00:07:18,137
Uh, do you want to sit down?

26
00:07:21,907 --> 00:07:25,811
Sorry to kind of throw you
on the spot,

27
00:07:25,844 --> 00:07:28,814
if you're nervous or anything.

28
00:07:28,847 --> 00:07:31,050
You can hold this.

29
00:07:31,083 --> 00:07:32,918
It's a quartz.

30
00:07:32,951 --> 00:07:36,255
Helps with concentration, if
you're into that sort of thing.

31
00:07:36,288 --> 00:07:40,693
- Are you?
- Yes.

32
00:07:44,663 --> 00:07:47,766
You can hold on
to it for right now.

33
00:07:47,799 --> 00:07:49,902
Has all my good energy in it.

34
00:07:51,670 --> 00:07:53,973
I want you to listen
to something.

35
00:07:54,006 --> 00:07:56,075
Cool.

36
00:07:56,642 --> 00:07:58,044
Alright. Okay.

37
00:08:20,198 --> 00:08:22,735
Here, put these in.

38
00:08:48,994 --> 00:08:50,796
Alright.

39
00:08:54,866 --> 00:08:56,969
This is the key
I want to do it in.

40
00:09:01,773 --> 00:09:03,943
For sure.

41
00:09:03,976 --> 00:09:06,078
Oh, no, you can
do it right here.

42
00:09:06,111 --> 00:09:08,280
You don't want me
to bring the mic over?

43
00:09:08,313 --> 00:09:09,782
No.

44
00:09:09,815 --> 00:09:11,016
Don't you want me
to sing into it?

45
00:09:11,049 --> 00:09:14,787
I want it to sound like far.

46
00:09:16,755 --> 00:09:19,258
Away from everything.

47
00:09:19,291 --> 00:09:21,160
You know what I mean?

48
00:09:21,193 --> 00:09:24,564
Like, everything's upside down.

49
00:09:26,164 --> 00:09:27,934
Upside down?

50
00:09:30,936 --> 00:09:33,673

81
00:13:18,263 --> 00:13:20,966

Ohhhhh.

83
00:13:36,381 --> 00:13:38,884
Hi.

84
00:13:38,917 --> 00:13:41,954
What are you doing?

85
00:13:41,987 --> 00:13:43,989
Why is that weird
that I would be calling?

86
00:13:44,022 --> 00:13:47,960
Like, we should still obviously
be able to talk.

87
00:13:54,599 --> 00:13:57,402
Who are you in New York with?

88
00:13:57,435 --> 00:13:59,872
Why did you even go
to New York again?

89
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:04,309
Right. Right. I love Ellen.

90
00:14:04,342 --> 00:14:05,878
Aaah!

91
00:14:08,546 --> 00:14:12,051
Do you know when you're
coming back from New York?

92
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:16,622
I mean, I don't know.
I was just asking.

93
00:14:19,457 --> 00:14:22,895
Obviously, I'm spending time
with Rosie.

94
00:14:22,928 --> 00:14:25,230
Yeah, she's just
been in her room.

95
00:14:30,101 --> 00:14:33,372
No, I am not on anything.

96
00:14:40,312 --> 00:14:42,314
I'm not on anything.

97
00:14:44,482 --> 00:14:47,052
Is there any way that
when you can come back, I...

98
00:14:50,288 --> 00:14:52,424
Okay.

about your theories, bro.

105
00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:34,066
What's your theory?

106
00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:36,234
See, she cares.

107
00:15:36,267 --> 00:15:42,507
My theory is most happy songs,
they're actually sad as fuck.

108
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:45,711
People just too stupid
to get it.

109
00:15:45,744 --> 00:15:48,580
Okay. For example?

110
00:15:48,613 --> 00:15:51,116
For example...

111
00:15:51,149 --> 00:15:54,453
Pharrell's song "Happy",
okay, that song is played

112
00:15:54,486 --> 00:15:57,222
at all the kids'
birthday parties, you know?

113
00:15:57,255 --> 00:15:59,624
- Mm-hmm.
- But the truth is

114
00:15:59,657 --> 00:16:02,594
when the chorus comes in,
it sounds like a bunch of moms

115
00:16:02,627 --> 00:16:04,997
on speed trying to convince
themselves or something.

116
00:16:06,131 --> 00:16:08,767
For real.

117
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,535
Hey, man, that song made money.

118
00:16:10,568 --> 00:16:13,405
I'm not saying
it's not a great song, dude.

119
00:16:13,438 --> 00:16:15,607
I'm just saying it sounds like

120
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:17,242
somebody putting a gun
to your head

121
00:16:17,275 --> 00:16:20,345
and telling you to be happy.
Yeah.

122
00:16:20,378 --> 00:16:22,280
- Cole! Cole!
- Right here!

123
00:16:22,313 --> 00:16:23,648
What happened
with you and Mae, huh?

124
00:16:23,681 --> 00:16:25,183
Cole!

125
00:16:25,216 --> 00:16:27,052
- Cole, do you have any comments?
- Cole!

126
00:16:27,085 --> 00:16:29,388
Cole, do you have any comment
about you and Mae?

127
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:39,365
How is Lena?

128
00:16:39,764 --> 00:16:42,200
Who?

129
00:16:42,233 --> 00:16:45,204
The girl, the singer.

130
00:16:49,574 --> 00:16:52,511
Who?

131
00:16:52,544 --> 00:16:57,016
The girl who we had
come in to the studio.

132
00:17:00,218 --> 00:17:03,288
What girl?

133
00:17:03,321 --> 00:17:05,124
For real?

134
00:17:08,626 --> 00:17:12,097
The girl, she sat
next to you by the piano

135
00:17:12,130 --> 00:17:13,398
like an hour ago.

136
00:17:13,431 --> 00:17:15,700
We brought her in.

137
00:17:15,733 --> 00:17:18,237
Yeah, she was a good singer.

138
00:17:19,604 --> 00:17:22,541
What the fuck?

139
00:17:22,574 --> 00:17:25,577
What?

140
00:17:25,610 --> 00:17:27,546
Are you high?

141
00:18:23,334 --> 00:18:25,771
Hey, Cole.

142
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:31,309
Hi, my little rose.

143
00:18:31,342 --> 00:18:34,646
What are you doing?

144
00:18:34,679 --> 00:18:36,448
I'm swimming.

145
00:18:36,481 --> 00:18:38,450
You want to swim?

146
00:18:38,483 --> 00:18:40,852
- Okay.
- Okay.

147
00:18:40,885 --> 00:18:43,788
Rosie, you need to
come back to bed.

148
00:18:43,821 --> 00:18:46,825
- Sorry, Cole.
- What?

149
00:18:46,858 --> 00:18:49,294
No.

150
00:18:49,327 --> 00:18:51,296
It's alright.

151
00:18:51,329 --> 00:18:52,831
Good night, Cassidy.

152
00:18:52,864 --> 00:18:57,269
Why do you always call me Cole
and not Daddy?

153
00:18:57,302 --> 00:19:00,906
Because you told me
to call you Cole.

154
00:19:00,939 --> 00:19:03,241
Did I?

155
00:19:03,274 --> 00:19:05,177
Cassidy, how's the guest house?

156
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:06,845
I had it cleaned before
you guys came.

157
00:19:06,878 --> 00:19:08,380
- It's been fine.
- It's fine?

158
00:19:08,413 --> 00:19:10,448
- Yeah.
- Okay.

159
00:19:10,481 --> 00:19:12,250
Let me know if
you need anything.

160
00:19:12,283 --> 00:19:13,585
Okay. Thank you.

161
00:19:13,618 --> 00:19:16,421
I think Cole's falling asleep.

162
00:19:16,454 --> 00:19:17,923
I'm not falling asleep.

163
00:19:17,956 --> 00:19:20,392
Come on, back to bed.

164
00:19:20,425 --> 00:19:22,961
Who's going to put Cole to bed?

165
00:19:22,994 --> 00:19:25,497
I will. I got it.

166
00:19:25,530 --> 00:19:26,932
Let's go, lady.

167
00:19:26,965 --> 00:19:29,534
You don't want to be tired when
Mommy comes back.

168
00:19:29,567 --> 00:19:31,369
- Good night.
- Isn't it great

169
00:19:31,402 --> 00:19:32,704
that you got to spend
so much time

170
00:19:32,737 --> 00:19:34,773
with Cole while you were here?

171
00:19:34,806 --> 00:19:37,342
I did?

172
00:19:38,476 --> 00:19:40,445
Night, Cole!

173
00:19:40,478 --> 00:19:43,182
I love you, princess.

174
00:19:51,656 --> 00:19:53,625
Alright, up.

175
00:19:56,327 --> 00:19:58,563
Cole, get out.

176
00:19:58,596 --> 00:20:01,399
- What?
- Get out of the pool.

177
00:20:01,432 --> 00:20:04,769
- No.
- Look at me.

178
00:20:04,802 --> 00:20:07,372
Get out of the fucking pool.

179
00:20:20,518 --> 00:20:22,887
Do you want help?

180
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:25,724
- I got it.
- Okay.

181
00:20:25,757 --> 00:20:27,859
Okay. Okay.

182
00:20:36,668 --> 00:20:39,838
Gross.

183
00:20:48,313 --> 00:20:50,682
You should go.

184
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:55,020
It's almost 2:00 a.m.

185
00:21:03,628 --> 00:21:05,797
What the fuck, Cole?

186
00:21:09,467 --> 00:21:13,372
Okay, I'm picking you up
tomorrow at noon.

187
00:21:18,476 --> 00:21:20,479
"Thank you, Ilana."

188
00:21:21,813 --> 00:21:25,350
Comment if you know
what this one is.

189
00:22:24,442 --> 00:22:26,745
- Hey.
- Hello.

190
00:22:28,646 --> 00:22:30,415
Um, come in.

191
00:22:32,884 --> 00:22:34,853
Thanks.

192
00:22:39,957 --> 00:22:43,027
Nice.

193
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:44,929
Thanks.

194
00:22:44,962 --> 00:22:47,566
It's a rental.
It's not permanent.

195
00:22:49,167 --> 00:22:51,569
Nothing is, right?

196
00:22:51,602 --> 00:22:54,172
Right. Um, you want me
to take your coat?

197
00:22:54,205 --> 00:22:56,641
In a minute.

198
00:22:58,109 --> 00:23:00,712
I was just in this neighborhood.

199
00:23:00,745 --> 00:23:02,881
For real? When?

200
00:23:02,914 --> 00:23:06,651
- Few hours ago.
- God damn. Okay.

201
00:23:06,684 --> 00:23:10,555
- Visiting who?
- Some movie producer.

202
00:23:13,758 --> 00:23:16,661
Which one?

203
00:23:16,694 --> 00:23:20,131
What's the difference, right?

204
00:23:20,164 --> 00:23:22,167
Right.

205
00:23:24,469 --> 00:23:27,038
I thought Bub said
you were bringing, um...

206
00:23:27,071 --> 00:23:28,907
Oh.

207
00:23:32,743 --> 00:23:35,480
Thanks.

208
00:23:37,682 --> 00:23:39,617
She didn't forget the box.

209
00:23:39,650 --> 00:23:41,085
Um, you want some?

210
00:23:41,118 --> 00:23:42,954
I'm good.

211
00:23:42,987 --> 00:23:46,057
For real? You don't want
like a bump or nothing.

212
00:23:48,025 --> 00:23:50,929
Would it make you
feel better if I did?

213
00:23:50,962 --> 00:23:54,232
Uh, nah, I just...

214
00:23:54,265 --> 00:23:57,469
I'm just trying to be
a good host.

215
00:23:58,002 --> 00:24:00,539
I appreciate it.

216
00:24:14,785 --> 00:24:16,488
Is this for real?

217
00:24:16,521 --> 00:24:18,556
Is what for real?

218
00:24:18,589 --> 00:24:21,092
This picture.

219
00:24:21,125 --> 00:24:23,828
Uh, yeah.

220
00:24:23,861 --> 00:24:26,531
She's your wife?

221
00:24:26,564 --> 00:24:28,733
Was my wife.

222
00:24:28,766 --> 00:24:32,204
We got a kid together,
but we're not together.

223
00:24:32,937 --> 00:24:35,139
Damn.

224
00:24:35,172 --> 00:24:38,243
She's so beautiful.

225
00:24:38,276 --> 00:24:39,978
Yeah.

226
00:25:06,971 --> 00:25:09,641
This feel good?

227
00:25:12,710 --> 00:25:14,246
Yeah.

228
00:25:15,212 --> 00:25:17,715
Didn't take long.

229
00:25:17,748 --> 00:25:21,253
Oh, no, that... That's not me.

230
00:25:25,022 --> 00:25:28,593
That's my crystal.

231
00:25:30,995 --> 00:25:33,097
- Sorry.
- Yeah, that's pretty insulting.

232
00:25:33,130 --> 00:25:34,666
I'm a lot bigger than this.

233
00:25:34,699 --> 00:25:35,900
This is like
one and a half inches.

234
00:25:35,933 --> 00:25:40,905
- Oh, my God.
- I'm so sorry.

235
00:25:40,938 --> 00:25:43,341
Damn.

236
00:25:43,374 --> 00:25:45,677
Damn.

237
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:49,581
- Uh, what is that?
- It's, uh, it's my crystal.

238
00:25:49,614 --> 00:25:51,649
It's a quartz.

239
00:25:51,682 --> 00:25:54,619
You carry it around with you?

240
00:25:54,652 --> 00:25:57,288
For like five years, yeah.

241
00:25:57,321 --> 00:26:00,658
Got all my energy in it,
everything I've been through.

242
00:26:00,691 --> 00:26:04,696
Feels like it kind of
stores all of it

243
00:26:04,729 --> 00:26:07,365
and channels other things.

244
00:26:07,398 --> 00:26:10,101
Helps me manifest, you know?

245
00:26:11,168 --> 00:26:13,038
Can I see it?

246
00:26:14,238 --> 00:26:17,041
Um...

247
00:26:17,074 --> 00:26:18,977
yeah, you can like look at it.

248
00:26:19,010 --> 00:26:20,745
It's...

249
00:26:24,248 --> 00:26:27,619
It's, you know... but fuck that.

250
00:26:43,401 --> 00:26:45,770
Come on.

251
00:26:45,803 --> 00:26:48,773
You want me to do
something or not?

252
00:26:52,810 --> 00:26:54,879
Okay.

253
00:27:22,907 --> 00:27:24,242
Hello.

254
00:27:24,275 --> 00:27:27,945
<i>Hey, buddy.
Sleeping in?</i>

255
00:27:27,978 --> 00:27:29,781
<i>No worries.
I got Dougie here, too.</i>

256
00:27:29,814 --> 00:27:31,282
<i>What's up, broseff?</i>

257
00:27:31,315 --> 00:27:33,351
Don't call me that.

258
00:27:33,384 --> 00:27:35,953
<i>Big day today.
Radio interview with Anne.</i>

259
00:27:35,986 --> 00:27:37,455
<i>And a meeting with our sponsor.</i>

260
00:27:37,488 --> 00:27:39,891
<i>I think it's over breakfast.</i>

261
00:27:39,924 --> 00:27:41,426
Sponsor?

262
00:27:41,459 --> 00:27:43,027
<i>The corporate sponsor
for the tour.</i>

263
00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:45,730
<i>The guys from Glows, remember?</i>

264
00:27:45,763 --> 00:27:47,732
<i>They're dumping
shit loads of money into that,</i>

265
00:27:47,765 --> 00:27:49,801
<i>so it's going to be a little
bit of a dog and pony show.</i>

266
00:27:51,402 --> 00:27:54,472
<i>We heard that girl Lisa
is going to be a star.</i>

267
00:27:54,505 --> 00:27:57,075
- What?
<i>- Lisa?</i>

268
00:27:57,108 --> 00:27:58,776
<i>- Lena.
- Lena.</i>

269
00:27:58,809 --> 00:28:02,280
<i>We should really jump on that.
Do you like her?</i>

270
00:28:02,313 --> 00:28:04,182
<i>Alright, we got to jump,
but we'll totally talk to her.</i>

271
00:28:04,215 --> 00:28:06,084
<i>Remember, 24/7, we got you.</i>

272
00:28:06,117 --> 00:28:07,919
<i>We'll check in
after your meetings.</i>

273
00:28:07,952 --> 00:28:10,388
Alright.

274
00:28:10,421 --> 00:28:13,324
Fuckin' douchbags.

275
00:28:28,305 --> 00:28:29,774
Oh, no.

276
00:28:30,341 --> 00:28:32,844
Oh, fuck.

277
00:28:32,877 --> 00:28:35,012
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

278
00:28:35,045 --> 00:28:36,381
Fuck.

279
00:28:41,385 --> 00:28:42,954
Oh, my God.

280
00:28:43,854 --> 00:28:45,957
No, no, no, no.

281
00:28:48,392 --> 00:28:50,028
Fuck!

282
00:28:54,031 --> 00:28:56,201
Rosie?

283
00:29:01,272 --> 00:29:03,441
Cassidy?

284
00:29:27,364 --> 00:29:30,935
Nice million-dollar view.

285
00:29:30,968 --> 00:29:33,204
So much shit in the air.

286
00:29:34,371 --> 00:29:36,140
So, how's it going?

287
00:29:36,173 --> 00:29:37,842
I'm working on it.

288
00:29:37,875 --> 00:29:40,444
Yeah? Well, you got anything
I can listen to?

289
00:29:40,477 --> 00:29:43,014
I'm working on it.

290
00:29:45,182 --> 00:29:47,351
Should I come down to the studio
and listen to something?

291
00:29:47,384 --> 00:29:49,487
I'm working on it.

292
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:51,455
Alright.

293
00:29:51,488 --> 00:29:53,357
Look, man, we're just...

294
00:29:53,390 --> 00:29:55,026
just trying to help.

295
00:29:55,059 --> 00:29:57,428
- Thanks.
- Come on, Cole.

296
00:29:57,461 --> 00:30:01,465
We got you the nicest
recording studio in Los Angeles.

297
00:30:01,498 --> 00:30:03,301
Frank fucking Sinatra recorded

298
00:30:03,334 --> 00:30:05,069
"Strangers in the Night" there,
for Christ's sake.

299
00:30:05,102 --> 00:30:06,170
I didn't ask for it, man.

300
00:30:06,203 --> 00:30:07,471
I know you didn't
ask for it, man.

301
00:30:07,504 --> 00:30:09,841
But we got it for you anyway.

302
00:30:09,874 --> 00:30:11,075
Alright?

303
00:30:11,108 --> 00:30:12,977
Yeah.

304
00:30:17,581 --> 00:30:20,351
Your nose is bleeding.

305
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:24,489
For real?

306
00:30:28,158 --> 00:30:30,295
No.

307
00:30:33,530 --> 00:30:35,600
Fuckin' asshole.

308
00:30:37,668 --> 00:30:39,503
You know, the other day,
I was trying to get my kid

309
00:30:39,536 --> 00:30:41,505
to put down his phone

310
00:30:41,538 --> 00:30:44,942
because it's like
a fucking constant now.

311
00:30:44,975 --> 00:30:50,047
Then I actually offered to
pay him to put it down.

312
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:54,285
And as I was hearing myself
say it, I thought,

313
00:30:54,318 --> 00:30:57,622
what a fucking asshole
I've become.

314
00:30:58,522 --> 00:31:01,592
I mean, who am I? Right?

315
00:31:01,625 --> 00:31:04,262
And he says to me, "How much?"

316
00:31:04,295 --> 00:31:06,197
I don't know, son. Five bucks.

317
00:31:06,230 --> 00:31:09,200
He says, "Make it $20."

318
00:31:09,233 --> 00:31:12,436
Alright. You got a deal.

319
00:31:12,469 --> 00:31:14,906
I paid him.

320
00:31:14,939 --> 00:31:17,341
Just like I'm paying you.

321
00:31:17,374 --> 00:31:19,510
So I'll see you down
at the fucking studio.

322
00:31:19,543 --> 00:31:21,613
You got it?

323
00:31:33,090 --> 00:31:34,926
You look fresh.

324
00:31:34,959 --> 00:31:37,461
I've been here for an hour.

325
00:31:37,494 --> 00:31:40,598
- I said noon.
- No, you didn't.

326
00:31:40,631 --> 00:31:43,434
Uh, yeah, I did.

327
00:31:43,467 --> 00:31:45,169
When's the last time
you were up before then?

328
00:31:45,202 --> 00:31:48,940
When's the last time you decided
to stop giving me shit?

329
00:31:48,973 --> 00:31:51,342
- I'm not giving you shit.
- Well, you are kind of.

330
00:31:51,375 --> 00:31:52,543
That's why I'm confused.

331
00:31:52,576 --> 00:31:54,278
So it makes me
ask this question.

332
00:31:54,311 --> 00:31:56,648
Um, am I your boss?

333
00:32:01,018 --> 00:32:02,219
Like with your words,
like, tell me.

334
00:32:02,252 --> 00:32:04,422
I want to know, am I your boss?

335
00:32:07,558 --> 00:32:09,493
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

336
00:32:09,526 --> 00:32:11,329
So maybe you can act
more like an employee

337
00:32:11,362 --> 00:32:13,064
and do your fucking job
so I'm not late.

338
00:32:13,097 --> 00:32:16,233
Or else, you can go work
at Burger King. Cool?

339
00:32:16,266 --> 00:32:17,568
Yep.

340
00:32:17,601 --> 00:32:19,036
Cool.

341
00:32:19,069 --> 00:32:21,539
Where's Rosie?

342
00:32:21,572 --> 00:32:24,141
She went home.

343
00:32:24,174 --> 00:32:26,010
Why is that?

344
00:32:26,043 --> 00:32:28,546
Uh, she went home because
she was here for two days

345
00:32:28,579 --> 00:32:30,748
and they never saw you
and Mae gets custody.

346
00:32:30,781 --> 00:32:32,984
Uh...

347
00:32:35,252 --> 00:32:39,090
I asked about Rose. I don't need
to hear the other name.

348
00:32:39,123 --> 00:32:40,758
You got me?

349
00:32:40,791 --> 00:32:42,693
- Okay.
- Okay.

350
00:32:42,726 --> 00:32:45,096
Because she can stay
in New York for the rest

351
00:32:45,129 --> 00:32:46,497
of her fucking life
for all I care.

352
00:32:46,530 --> 00:32:47,999
- Yep.
- I don't care.

353
00:32:48,032 --> 00:32:50,301
- Yes, Cole, okay.
- Cool.

354
00:32:50,334 --> 00:32:52,236
- I'm ready.
- Okay. You ready?

355
00:32:52,269 --> 00:32:53,471
- Yeah.
- Let's go.

356
00:32:53,504 --> 00:32:56,140
Let's do it.

357
00:33:09,053 --> 00:33:10,588
Hey, Ilana.

358
00:33:10,621 --> 00:33:12,523
What?

359
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:18,529
I'm sorry.

360
00:33:22,232 --> 00:33:25,036
It's fine.

361
00:33:25,069 --> 00:33:27,705
I just feel bad about Rosie.

362
00:33:27,738 --> 00:33:32,643
I... I don't get why
I act like this.

363
00:33:35,212 --> 00:33:39,517
Maybe you could try a little
harder when she's around.

364
00:33:52,863 --> 00:33:56,500
Can we stop and get a new phone?
Mine's gone.

365
00:33:56,533 --> 00:33:58,202
How?

366
00:33:58,235 --> 00:34:00,237
I threw it.

367
00:34:00,270 --> 00:34:03,474
You threw it where?

368
00:34:03,807 --> 00:34:05,509
If I knew where,
then we wouldn't need

369
00:34:05,542 --> 00:34:07,712
to find a new phone, would we?

370
00:34:11,748 --> 00:34:13,651
Hope I'm not disturbing.

371
00:34:13,684 --> 00:34:17,221
- Not at all.
- I'm Eve, Anne's assistant.

372
00:34:17,254 --> 00:34:20,357
Ilana.

373
00:34:20,390 --> 00:34:22,526
- Hey.
- Hi.

374
00:34:22,559 --> 00:34:24,695
I just want to say
what a huge fan I am.

375
00:34:24,728 --> 00:34:27,765
I've been looking forward
to this interview for forever.

376
00:34:27,798 --> 00:34:30,701
- That's so nice.
- Yeah. Thanks.

377
00:34:30,734 --> 00:34:34,305
So if you need anything, really,
just let me know

378
00:34:34,338 --> 00:34:36,407
and I'll get it for you.

379
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:38,209
I'll take a phone.

380
00:34:40,544 --> 00:34:43,747
Yeah, like, a new phone.

381
00:34:43,780 --> 00:34:46,417
'Cause I...

382
00:34:46,450 --> 00:34:50,387
Uh, I don't... I...

383
00:34:50,420 --> 00:34:53,657
- I was thinking more...
- Is Anne ready for us?

384
00:34:53,690 --> 00:34:55,860
Uh, yeah.

385
00:34:55,893 --> 00:34:58,295
Cool. Let's do it.

386
00:34:58,328 --> 00:35:00,598
- Just this way.
- Come on, Cole.

387
00:35:00,631 --> 00:35:02,767
Just this way.

388
00:35:04,568 --> 00:35:06,471
Cole.

389
00:35:07,571 --> 00:35:10,207
- Hi, Cole. Welcome.
- Hi.

390
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:12,710
- Thank you for coming.
- Yeah, thanks for having me.

391
00:35:12,743 --> 00:35:16,413
Oh, what, uh,
why are the cameras there?

392
00:35:16,446 --> 00:35:18,149
Oh, we're doing a live stream.

393
00:35:18,182 --> 00:35:22,319
Web on demand. Live stream.
It's going be great.

394
00:35:22,352 --> 00:35:23,854
- Did... oh, did...
- Um, with our interview?

395
00:35:23,887 --> 00:35:27,324
Yeah. Did they not tell you?

396
00:35:27,357 --> 00:35:30,327
No. They didn't tell me.

397
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:31,896
I... I tell you what.

398
00:35:31,929 --> 00:35:34,165
Hair and makeup
will be super quick.

399
00:35:34,198 --> 00:35:35,633
Not a problem.

400
00:35:35,666 --> 00:35:37,835
I'mma just... give me
one minute, please.

401
00:35:37,868 --> 00:35:40,638
Yeah, take your time.
Take your time. No rush.

402
00:35:46,343 --> 00:35:48,312
- I told you.
- No, you didn't tell me.

403
00:35:48,345 --> 00:35:49,813
I did.

404
00:35:49,846 --> 00:35:51,815
No, you didn't say
it was on camera.

405
00:35:51,848 --> 00:35:54,318
You knew. I told you.

406
00:35:54,351 --> 00:35:56,921
I... I hate when
you make excuses.

407
00:35:56,954 --> 00:35:59,590
- It's so fucking annoying.
- I'm not making excuses.

408
00:35:59,623 --> 00:36:00,724
I'm just telling you.

409
00:36:00,757 --> 00:36:02,860
Telling me what, though?

410
00:36:02,893 --> 00:36:04,962
I told you.

411
00:36:04,995 --> 00:36:07,665
You didn't tell me shit, Ilana.
Stop fucking lying!

412
00:36:07,698 --> 00:36:09,934
I swear to God
I will fucking fire you.

413
00:36:09,967 --> 00:36:12,269
Stop. People are watching.

414
00:36:12,302 --> 00:36:15,940
I don't give a fuck
if anyone's watching!

415
00:36:15,973 --> 00:36:17,575
Let 'em watch!

416
00:36:17,608 --> 00:36:20,278
You do your job so great,
they should see.

417
00:36:23,914 --> 00:36:28,452
Fuck you, dude.
You're such a fucking bitch.

418
00:36:28,485 --> 00:36:30,955
Call me a bitch again,
and you will be fired.

419
00:36:32,956 --> 00:36:36,360
Bitch. You're a fuckin' bitch.

420
00:36:36,393 --> 00:36:37,861
What do you want me
to do next for you?

421
00:36:37,894 --> 00:36:39,663
- Wipe your fucking ass?
- Just do your fuckin' job!

422
00:36:39,696 --> 00:36:41,799
I am doing my fucking job!
Babysitting you day and night,

423
00:36:41,832 --> 00:36:44,368
you fucking douche bag!

424
00:36:44,401 --> 00:36:45,836
God, I hate you!

425
00:36:45,869 --> 00:36:48,772
- You're fired! Fuck you!
- Really? Really?

426
00:36:48,805 --> 00:36:51,242
How you gonna get home, Cole?
Who's gonna drive you?

427
00:36:51,275 --> 00:36:52,843
- Uber! Duh!
- You can't!

428
00:36:52,876 --> 00:36:55,279
You don't have a phone!
Who's gonna get you a new phone?

429
00:36:55,312 --> 00:36:56,914
- My new assistant!
- Good!

430
00:36:56,947 --> 00:36:59,316
Well, make sure you tell her
where all the fucking pills

431
00:36:59,349 --> 00:37:01,318
are stashed so you don't
freak out on her when you

432
00:37:01,351 --> 00:37:02,820
- can't find them.
- Shut the fuck up!

433
00:37:02,853 --> 00:37:04,655
- Shut the fuck up!
- Make sure she can fish you out

434
00:37:04,688 --> 00:37:05,923
- of the fucking pool...
- Fuck you!

435
00:37:05,956 --> 00:37:07,391
...when you're
fucking passed out!

436
00:37:07,424 --> 00:37:08,892
- Fuck you!
- Tell her to hold your

437
00:37:08,925 --> 00:37:12,463
fucking hand when you have
to do fucking anything!

438
00:37:32,316 --> 00:37:36,553
It's like the part, I just don't
want like the part in my hair.

439
00:37:36,586 --> 00:37:38,789
Can...

440
00:37:39,623 --> 00:37:41,925
He, um...

441
00:37:41,958 --> 00:37:45,896
he likes it a little
messier in the front.

442
00:37:47,998 --> 00:37:51,769
Maybe if you could get some...
Some product like, uh...

443
00:37:51,802 --> 00:37:52,836
Clay or something.

444
00:37:52,869 --> 00:37:55,706
The clay, like the molding wax.

445
00:38:05,615 --> 00:38:07,852
I like this.

446
00:38:21,765 --> 00:38:23,934
You should let them
see your eyes.

447
00:38:31,007 --> 00:38:32,076
Hello!

448
00:38:34,745 --> 00:38:37,981
Hello, TV,
I have an album coming out.

449
00:38:44,921 --> 00:38:49,460
I don't want to do this one.

450
00:38:49,493 --> 00:38:50,894
Need help?

451
00:38:50,927 --> 00:38:53,097
- Yeah.
- Okay.

452
00:38:54,865 --> 00:38:57,401
I don't want to get your hair.

453
00:38:59,002 --> 00:39:01,772
- Ah.
- Don't move.

454
00:39:02,906 --> 00:39:04,942
Okay.

455
00:39:08,645 --> 00:39:10,881
You look good.

456
00:39:10,914 --> 00:39:12,716
And I don't deserve you.

457
00:39:14,184 --> 00:39:16,487
Who inspires you?

458
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:18,922
- What did you say?
- Who inspires you?

459
00:39:18,955 --> 00:39:20,858
- Um...
- Doesn't have to be music.

460
00:39:20,891 --> 00:39:22,626
Yeah, well,
sometimes it's not music.

461
00:39:22,659 --> 00:39:25,429
A lot of times it is,
but sometimes it might be like,

462
00:39:25,462 --> 00:39:28,031
you know, if I had my shoes off
and I was feeling this rug,

463
00:39:28,064 --> 00:39:29,733
I'd be like,
"Oh, man, we need merch

464
00:39:29,766 --> 00:39:32,736
that makes me feel
the way this rug feels.

465
00:39:32,769 --> 00:39:35,105
Like, we need a sweater
with this material on it.

466
00:39:35,138 --> 00:39:36,640
Maybe we should just
sit down on the floor

467
00:39:36,673 --> 00:39:38,075
and do this.

468
00:39:38,108 --> 00:39:39,843
Or it's like architecture
or something like that,

469
00:39:39,876 --> 00:39:42,079
or it's like the way
the fuckin' air smells

470
00:39:42,112 --> 00:39:44,882
when you're driving through
Joshua Tree in the desert

471
00:39:44,915 --> 00:39:46,884
high on mushrooms or something,
and you're like,

472
00:39:46,917 --> 00:39:49,853
"Whoa, there needs to be
a song for this."

473
00:39:49,886 --> 00:39:55,159
Like, music is like...
It's like a bookmark.

474
00:39:55,192 --> 00:39:58,429
You can always turn back
and remember that chapter

475
00:39:58,462 --> 00:40:00,464
when you hear a certain thing
that triggers it.

476
00:40:00,497 --> 00:40:02,466
Give... give me a time
and place.

477
00:40:02,499 --> 00:40:03,834
What's som... what's...

478
00:40:03,867 --> 00:40:07,938
What do you remember
hearing somewhere that...

479
00:40:07,971 --> 00:40:10,841
Oh, like 10 years old,
the first Blink 182 album

480
00:40:10,874 --> 00:40:12,075
when I heard
"What's My Age Again?"

481
00:40:12,108 --> 00:40:13,510
And we were just like...

482
00:40:13,543 --> 00:40:15,012
Where did you hear it?

483
00:40:15,045 --> 00:40:19,183
Oh, we had waited in line
at a store to get the CD,

484
00:40:19,216 --> 00:40:21,718
and we came back, and we all had
to share the CD player.

485
00:40:21,751 --> 00:40:23,554
So each of us got, you know,

486
00:40:23,587 --> 00:40:25,489
to listen to the album
all the way through.

487
00:40:25,522 --> 00:40:26,957
And the other group of kids

488
00:40:26,990 --> 00:40:29,593
would be playing like Halo,
I think.

489
00:40:29,626 --> 00:40:31,128
And so we'd each get our like

490
00:40:31,161 --> 00:40:33,130
45 minutes or hour,
however long the album was,

491
00:40:33,163 --> 00:40:37,468
to just listen to it, and I
remember hearing it, and like,

492
00:40:37,501 --> 00:40:38,802
yeah, I was like, "Oh, my God."

493
00:40:38,835 --> 00:40:41,038
Or like the first 50 Cent album,

494
00:40:41,071 --> 00:40:43,040
when 50 Cent
dropped that first album,

495
00:40:43,073 --> 00:40:44,741
we were all on the school bus,

496
00:40:44,774 --> 00:40:48,011
and everyone had to have like...
We... we wanted it...

497
00:40:48,044 --> 00:40:49,780
We all wanted to listen
to it at the same time so bad

498
00:40:49,813 --> 00:40:51,582
we broke the headphones in half.

499
00:40:51,615 --> 00:40:53,183
This is back when headphones
still connected.

500
00:40:53,216 --> 00:40:55,052
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
each person got an ear.

501
00:40:55,085 --> 00:40:57,955
And so we each would, like,
take it and put it in their ear

502
00:40:57,988 --> 00:40:59,656
so you could listen,
and we were like,

503
00:40:59,689 --> 00:41:02,960
"Oh, my God, 50 Cent's so good."

504
00:41:03,927 --> 00:41:07,564
Do you...
Do you think rock stars,

505
00:41:07,597 --> 00:41:13,471
rap stars in general
are special people?

506
00:41:14,237 --> 00:41:18,542
No. I mean,
there's something about

507
00:41:18,575 --> 00:41:20,143
it that's divine.

508
00:41:20,176 --> 00:41:22,679
- Mm-hmm.
- Because what you say is able

509
00:41:22,712 --> 00:41:24,681
to reach so many
and influence so many.

510
00:41:24,714 --> 00:41:27,918
But there's also something
about it that's sacrificial.

511
00:41:27,951 --> 00:41:34,658
Like how when the Mayans used to
choose the baby that they would,

512
00:41:34,691 --> 00:41:40,063
you know, kind of lulled with
with acceptance and worship,

513
00:41:40,096 --> 00:41:42,799
but then sacrifice them, right?

514
00:41:42,832 --> 00:41:46,937
The same people that loved them
and made them feel special

515
00:41:46,970 --> 00:41:49,806
were the same ones
that threw them

516
00:41:49,839 --> 00:41:56,079
to these underwater caverns that
were like... that became...

517
00:41:56,112 --> 00:41:59,583
- But they displayed them first.
- Yeah.

518
00:41:59,616 --> 00:42:02,920
They held them up
for everyone to see.

519
00:42:02,953 --> 00:42:06,089
Said, "This is our chosen one."

520
00:42:06,122 --> 00:42:12,729
Do you think performers,
artists are

521
00:42:12,762 --> 00:42:14,598
always on display?

522
00:42:22,238 --> 00:42:25,342
Do you want to keep
talking or...

523
00:42:25,375 --> 00:42:27,978
Do you need...
Do you need to take a minute?

524
00:42:34,618 --> 00:42:36,620
I'm sorry.

525
00:42:42,659 --> 00:42:44,261
Cole!

526
00:42:44,294 --> 00:42:46,664
Cole!

527
00:43:36,746 --> 00:43:38,849
I'm against
Shirley Temple shaming.

528
00:43:38,882 --> 00:43:41,184
Also, someone carved
a dick right here.

529
00:43:41,217 --> 00:43:43,854
Inappropriate.

530
00:43:43,887 --> 00:43:48,358
Excuse me.
Why two registers?

531
00:43:48,391 --> 00:43:53,797
Computer one sucks.
This is really cool.

532
00:43:53,830 --> 00:43:55,198
Hello.

533
00:43:55,231 --> 00:43:57,301
Thought we agreed just one.

534
00:43:59,035 --> 00:44:01,705
Here we are. Just one.

535
00:44:02,806 --> 00:44:04,274
Where were you?

They were just watching fucking
Netflix or some shit.

Come on.

777
00:57:03,185 --> 00:57:05,588
You know,
everybody's got a gun now.

778
00:57:05,621 --> 00:57:07,524
Got to be careful.

786
00:59:25,327 --> 00:59:29,999
Your job is to drive him home
when he finishes work.

your fucking job.

one more year of this

- Isn't that some shit?

Oh, corroded. My septum.

813
01:01:04,426 --> 01:01:07,863
He said a year, so we got
364 more days.

814
01:01:07,896 --> 01:01:10,299
- 11 months.
- Exactly.

815
01:01:10,332 --> 01:01:12,134
11 months, we're good.

816
01:01:12,167 --> 01:01:14,136
We'll give it an extra
bit of time.

817
01:01:14,169 --> 01:01:17,239
I don't think he was accounting
for me doing it every day.

818
01:01:17,272 --> 01:01:19,241
So we really have a lot of time.

819
01:01:19,274 --> 01:01:22,011
You're not going
to do it every day.

820
01:01:22,044 --> 01:01:24,113

- I canceled the tour.

I'm stuck here.

822
01:01:25,814 --> 01:01:28,384
But you can maybe travel,
go some place.

823
01:01:28,417 --> 01:01:30,019

all around the world.

824
01:01:30,052 --> 01:01:32,154
You didn't see one place
where you went,

825
01:01:32,187 --> 01:01:34,790
"Shit, I can just live here
and live a normal life."

826
01:01:34,823 --> 01:01:36,759
Never left the bus.

827
01:01:36,792 --> 01:01:39,128

828
01:01:40,929 --> 01:01:42,965

01:01:42,998 --> 01:01:44,934
Yeah.

830
01:01:44,967 --> 01:01:47,369
I don't know.
I think travel is good.

831
01:01:47,402 --> 01:01:52,007
When I was growing up
thinking about Hollywood, L.A.,

832
01:01:52,040 --> 01:01:53,776
I was like, "It's gonna be

833
01:01:53,809 --> 01:01:56,912
bright, light,
friendly and fun."

834
01:01:56,945 --> 01:01:59,115
I don't know. This is not
exactly how I pictured it.

835
01:01:59,148 --> 01:02:00,416
You know?

836
01:02:00,449 --> 01:02:02,818
- It's not?
- Not exactly.

837

839
01:02:07,389 --> 01:02:10,259
I don't know, I think, like,
just sometimes I spend time

840
01:02:10,292 --> 01:02:12,194
imagining living
on a farm somewhere.

841
01:02:12,227 --> 01:02:14,897
I've spent the night
in this place before.

- With a woman?
- No, no.

844
01:02:19,168 --> 01:02:21,137
Probably right here.
They woke me up.

845
01:02:21,170 --> 01:02:24,540
They're like, "It's 11:00 in
the fucking morning, get out."

01:06:07,596 --> 01:06:10,733
- Do you need...
- Oh, my God.

884
01:06:10,766 --> 01:06:13,469
I need to find my crystal.

885
01:06:13,502 --> 01:06:15,304
Okay.

886
01:06:19,207 --> 01:06:20,709
And I need new...

887
01:06:20,742 --> 01:06:22,979
And I need new clothes.

888
01:06:28,784 --> 01:06:30,553
Hey.

889
01:06:32,287 --> 01:06:35,657
- Yeah.
- You good?

890
01:06:35,690 --> 01:06:38,127
I feel like shit.

891
01:06:38,160 --> 01:06:41,263
- She just came in.
- Who?

892
01:06:41,296 --> 01:06:42,698
I didn't know what
to tell her, bro.

893
01:06:42,731 --> 01:06:44,767
So I just asked her
if she wanted to wait.

894
01:06:44,800 --> 01:06:46,035
Who?

895
01:06:55,510 --> 01:06:57,279
Okay.

896
01:07:49,831 --> 01:07:53,735
Why you laughing?
Tell me now.

897
01:07:53,768 --> 01:07:57,506
Um, I went on a date.

898
01:07:58,874 --> 01:08:01,410
With who?

899
01:08:01,443 --> 01:08:05,514
Just some guy
that I met on Tinder.

900
01:08:05,547 --> 01:08:08,684
- Tinder.
- And I am just like, you know...

901
01:08:08,717 --> 01:08:12,254
- Wow, Tinder.
- What the fuck else

902
01:08:12,287 --> 01:08:13,755
am I gonna... when do I have
time to meet anybody?

903
01:08:13,788 --> 01:08:17,759
- Ilana's on Tinder?
- Not anymore. Not after that.

904
01:08:17,792 --> 01:08:19,428
After what? What happened?

905
01:08:19,461 --> 01:08:20,896
After you met your
perfect date on Tinder.

906
01:08:20,929 --> 01:08:22,664
I don't know.
He's just like Italian.

907
01:08:22,697 --> 01:08:25,334
He was, like,
really into, like, telling me...

908
01:08:25,367 --> 01:08:28,403
I thought you liked Italians.

909
01:08:28,436 --> 01:08:31,140
I don't... I mean,
I don't... I'll take anything

910
01:08:31,173 --> 01:08:32,741
at this point.

911
01:08:34,376 --> 01:08:36,778
- Yo. What?
- He was like, I said something

912
01:08:36,811 --> 01:08:39,214
that I guess wasn't that...
I was like reaching

913
01:08:39,247 --> 01:08:40,516
in conversation.

914
01:08:40,549 --> 01:08:42,151
It wasn't that deep
or something.

915
01:08:42,184 --> 01:08:43,852
And he was like, "You know..."

916
01:08:43,885 --> 01:08:45,654
But you know you like
to talk about some wild shit.

917
01:08:45,687 --> 01:08:47,356
- So what did you say?
- I didn't say any...

918
01:08:47,389 --> 01:08:48,590
It was so mundane
because I thought

919
01:08:48,623 --> 01:08:50,259
he was so boring,
and he was like,

920
01:08:50,292 --> 01:08:51,927
"You know, I really like
really intellectual people."

921
01:08:51,960 --> 01:08:54,163
- Right.
- Like, as if to say

922
01:08:54,196 --> 01:08:55,464
I'm a fucking idiot.

923
01:08:55,497 --> 01:08:58,167
So I was just like,
"Oh, okay, cool."

924
01:08:58,200 --> 01:09:01,737
You know? So, no, I'm done.
I'm done.

925
01:09:03,872 --> 01:09:05,741
So he hates you.
That went bad.

926
01:09:05,774 --> 01:09:09,611
I don't know.
Like, he still wanted to...

927
01:09:09,644 --> 01:09:12,881
But I didn't. Anyway.
Yeah, it sucks.

928
01:09:12,914 --> 01:09:16,652
- Well, I still got faith in you.
- How's your...

929
01:09:16,685 --> 01:09:17,920
What's her name?

930
01:09:17,953 --> 01:09:20,489
Oh, Catherine.
Oh, she's gone.

931
01:09:20,522 --> 01:09:22,558
- Gone?
- She's long gone.

932
01:09:22,591 --> 01:09:23,725
- Why?
- I don't even like

933
01:09:23,758 --> 01:09:24,960
thinking about her
no more, like...

934
01:09:24,993 --> 01:09:26,895
- Why?
- I like my drums

935
01:09:26,928 --> 01:09:28,397
better than her.

936
01:09:28,430 --> 01:09:29,831
I thought you were, like,
hooking up

937
01:09:29,864 --> 01:09:32,568
with her last week still.

938
01:09:32,601 --> 01:09:34,937
She was worthless.

939
01:09:36,871 --> 01:09:39,975
Okay.

940
01:09:40,008 --> 01:09:43,679
Like, I'm just...

941
01:11:00,055 --> 01:11:03,559
I found something today.

942
01:11:06,094 --> 01:11:08,464
I found something today.

943
01:11:27,449 --> 01:11:30,319
I went to a house last night.

944
01:11:30,352 --> 01:11:32,688
Oh, yeah. What house?

945
01:11:32,721 --> 01:11:36,292
A house where
a kid killed his parents.

946
01:11:39,461 --> 01:11:41,363
What the fuck
are you talking about?

947
01:11:45,433 --> 01:11:47,770
I was waiting in the car.

948
01:11:49,371 --> 01:11:51,006
And I looked over,
and there was this

949
01:11:51,039 --> 01:11:52,908
caution tape around this house.

950
01:11:52,941 --> 01:11:56,945
Giant black palm tree over it.

951
01:11:56,978 --> 01:12:00,549
It was like drawing me to it.

952
01:12:02,550 --> 01:12:06,021
Like I needed to know something
that was going on inside.

953
01:12:07,489 --> 01:12:09,691
So I...

954
01:12:09,724 --> 01:12:13,562
went inside, and I saw
where they were killed.

955
01:12:14,162 --> 01:12:16,765
Cole, you could get into...

956
01:12:16,798 --> 01:12:19,835
I went into this kid's room,
right?

957
01:12:19,868 --> 01:12:26,608
It was the most normal room,
like games and... and a bed

958
01:12:26,641 --> 01:12:28,710
and...

959
01:12:28,743 --> 01:12:30,546
And there was a poster.

960
01:12:32,781 --> 01:12:35,650
Okay.

961
01:12:35,683 --> 01:12:38,554
I was on the poster.

962
01:12:40,488 --> 01:12:42,891
You're on a million posters.

963
01:12:44,125 --> 01:12:46,895
Not of kids that
murder their parents.

964
01:13:35,143 --> 01:13:36,879
- Hey.
- Hey.

965
01:13:41,950 --> 01:13:43,718
Nice to be back.

966
01:13:43,751 --> 01:13:46,021
Is it?

967
01:13:46,054 --> 01:13:47,823
Sure.

968
01:13:51,893 --> 01:13:54,162
You ever swim?

969
01:13:54,195 --> 01:13:55,931
Sometimes.

970
01:13:55,964 --> 01:13:58,700
Why? You want to?

971
01:13:58,733 --> 01:14:01,002
Yeah, maybe.

972
01:14:01,035 --> 01:14:05,774
Okay. I'll go try and find
a swimsuit for you or something.

973
01:14:05,807 --> 01:14:08,644
Why would I need one of those?

974
01:14:09,944 --> 01:14:12,781
Right.

975
01:14:12,814 --> 01:14:14,817
You can start with your coat.

976
01:14:28,663 --> 01:14:30,165
Um...

977
01:14:30,198 --> 01:14:32,568
I have something for you.

978
01:14:47,715 --> 01:14:49,818
I don't know why I took it.

979
01:14:51,686 --> 01:14:54,156
I just needed something,
I guess.

980
01:14:58,927 --> 01:15:00,996
Yeah.

981
01:15:01,029 --> 01:15:04,132
I, uh... I can feel that.

982
01:15:17,211 --> 01:15:19,581
You want to cut something up?

983
01:15:23,952 --> 01:15:27,989
Cool. You want some?

984
01:15:28,022 --> 01:15:30,325
Sure.

985
01:15:30,358 --> 01:15:32,894
You know, your crystal
didn't really work.

986
01:15:32,927 --> 01:15:35,230
That's funny.

987
01:15:36,598 --> 01:15:40,669
Um, alright, well, one for me.

988
01:15:40,702 --> 01:15:43,071
And one for you.

989
01:15:48,142 --> 01:15:50,645
So, did you get
any music in here?

990
01:15:50,678 --> 01:15:51,980
No.

991
01:15:52,013 --> 01:15:53,214
Really?

992
01:15:53,247 --> 01:15:55,283
Really.

993
01:15:55,316 --> 01:15:57,652
Oh.

994
01:15:57,685 --> 01:16:01,089
I could play some
on my phone or something.

995
01:16:01,122 --> 01:16:02,223
Okay.

996
01:16:02,256 --> 01:16:04,292
What do you want to hear?

997
01:16:04,325 --> 01:16:06,061
One of your songs.

998
01:16:06,094 --> 01:16:10,299
Uh, absolutely not,
but I can find something.

999
01:16:17,305 --> 01:16:21,142
I was expecting something
a little different.

1000
01:16:21,175 --> 01:16:23,178

No.

You cool to go to the studio?

1046
01:21:16,203 --> 01:21:18,506
Yeah. Did you call Syl?

1047
01:21:18,539 --> 01:21:22,644
No. Think I just want to do
some stuff by myself.

1048
01:21:22,677 --> 01:21:25,613
- Cool.
- Cool.

1049

01:21:31,419 --> 01:21:36,257

What are you talking about?

1053
01:21:40,995 --> 01:21:44,099
Did you, like, swallow
your crystal or something?

1054
01:21:46,467 --> 01:21:49,537
Man, fuck you.

1055
01:21:49,570 --> 01:21:51,572
Did you like that better?
Okay.

1056
01:21:51,605 --> 01:21:54,509
Much. Thank you.
You were scaring me.

1057
01:21:57,244 --> 01:21:58,613
Maybe I'll drive.

1058
01:21:58,646 --> 01:22:01,049
- That's a great idea.
- Right?

1059
01:22:06,220 --> 01:22:07,989
What?

1060
01:22:10,157 --> 01:22:12,293
You know what ad libs are?

1061
01:22:12,326 --> 01:22:15,396
- Yeah.
- Do you have any cool ad libs?

1062
01:22:15,429 --> 01:22:16,664
- Ad libs?
- Yeah.

1063
01:22:16,697 --> 01:22:18,299
Do you have any cool ad libs?

1064
01:22:18,332 --> 01:22:21,602
Like, what's your ad lib
if you were in the studio?

1065
01:22:21,635 --> 01:22:23,538
- If I was in the studio?
- Like your song.

1066
01:22:23,571 --> 01:22:26,507
Like, um, your ad libs
on your song, what would it be?

1067
01:22:26,540 --> 01:22:28,643
Give me an example of an ad lib.

1068
01:22:28,676 --> 01:22:30,378

01:22:32,380 --> 01:22:34,115

1070
01:22:34,148 --> 01:22:36,517

01:22:40,054 --> 01:22:41,689

01:22:56,103 --> 01:22:58,306
- It's on my crown.
- Okay.

1080
01:23:00,441 --> 01:23:02,410
