1
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:06,865
I'm not sure I know how it began.

2
00:01:13,006 --> 00:01:17,409
But in the midst of a life
that I now barely remember,

3
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,776
in the midst of those now-forgotten

4
00:01:22,849 --> 00:01:24,714
New York days and nights,

5
00:01:26,052 --> 00:01:28,020
something happened.

6
00:01:39,866 --> 00:01:42,300
I believe it's all true,

7
00:01:42,368 --> 00:01:44,598
but it started with a dream.

8
00:01:49,008 --> 00:01:51,704
There was a woman onstage...

9
00:01:54,047 --> 00:01:55,810
and a piano...

10
00:01:59,052 --> 00:02:00,610
and a man.

11
00:02:29,048 --> 00:02:31,175
As happens in a dream,

12
00:02:31,251 --> 00:02:34,345
I felt that someone was
looking at me.

13
00:02:45,732 --> 00:02:48,929
I knew he was there,
but I couldn't see him.

14
00:03:12,158 --> 00:03:15,457
Someone was looking at me, smiling.

15
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:35,606
And then I was looking
at a woman onstage.

16
00:03:44,958 --> 00:03:48,450
I think she could hear footsteps.

17
00:03:55,101 --> 00:03:57,365
I could hear her breath.

18
00:04:05,345 --> 00:04:08,337
And then the dream ended, I think,

19
00:04:08,414 --> 00:04:10,041
and I was in a rehearsal.

20
00:04:11,551 --> 00:04:12,813
That was...

21
00:04:14,187 --> 00:04:16,485
- yeah, it was really--
- It was good?

22
00:04:16,556 --> 00:04:18,854
really-- no, it's--
I think that there's--

23
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:21,792
we can use it
somewhere in the piece.

24
00:04:21,861 --> 00:04:24,728
Maybe...

25
00:04:24,797 --> 00:04:27,891
- someone watching you do it...
- Watching.

26
00:04:27,967 --> 00:04:30,265
...or something, you know?

27
00:04:31,337 --> 00:04:32,770
It's so strange,

28
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:32,939
intense.

29
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:35,032
intense.

30
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:36,769
And then you came.

31
00:04:37,977 --> 00:04:40,844
Tyrone? Hey.

32
00:04:40,913 --> 00:04:43,143
I'm so glad you're here.

33
00:04:43,216 --> 00:04:45,616
- I'm-- I'm Martine.
- Hi.

34
00:04:45,685 --> 00:04:47,516
- Hi, good to meet you.
- It's really great...

35
00:04:47,587 --> 00:04:50,420
And maybe that's where
the story really begins.

36
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:52,685
- Everyone, this is Tyrone.
- Hi.

37
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:54,420
- This is Raymond Carlisle...
- Welcome.

38
00:04:54,494 --> 00:04:56,257
- Thanks.
-...Julie Abbott, Anita Ford.

39
00:04:56,329 --> 00:04:57,591
- Hey.
- Tyrone Devlin.

40
00:04:57,664 --> 00:04:59,063
- Hey.
- Hi.

41
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:01,123
- So... good, really.
- All right.

42
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:04,169
- l, uh-- I saw you in that--
- Oh, thank you.

43
00:05:04,237 --> 00:05:06,535
--that film.
You know, that one--

44
00:05:06,606 --> 00:05:10,303
that French thing about
the translator, the writer.

45
00:05:10,376 --> 00:05:13,470
No. I don't think so, no.

46
00:05:13,546 --> 00:05:15,673
Oh, I thought--

47
00:05:15,748 --> 00:05:18,740
- really?
- Yeah, that wasn't me.

48
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:22,811
Well, are you--
you must be super tired.

49
00:05:22,889 --> 00:05:25,824
We're just-- I don't do--
I don't usually do a read-through,

50
00:05:25,892 --> 00:05:28,258
- so we're just gonna do little bits.
- Oh.

51
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:29,955
- Okay.
- Just hang out or--

52
00:05:30,029 --> 00:05:33,556
- I'd rather not just watch but--
- Oh, okay.

53
00:05:33,633 --> 00:05:36,693
You can't be serious--
you and him?

54
00:05:36,769 --> 00:05:38,293
Of course I'm not serious.

55
00:05:38,371 --> 00:05:40,430
- I'm teasing you.
- Oh.

56
00:05:40,506 --> 00:05:42,474
And then we all had

57
00:05:42,542 --> 00:05:44,442
our first rehearsal together.

58
00:05:47,113 --> 00:05:49,809
Julie was there...

59
00:05:52,285 --> 00:05:54,480
I can't believe that you chose him.

60
00:05:54,554 --> 00:05:56,351
...and Raymond was there.

61
00:05:56,422 --> 00:05:58,856
I can't believe you chose him.

62
00:05:58,925 --> 00:06:01,689
- "Believe that you want him."
- It's...

63
00:06:01,761 --> 00:06:04,252
"Belie-- believe that you--"

64
00:06:05,331 --> 00:06:07,231
I can't believe that you want him.

65
00:06:08,301 --> 00:06:09,563
Well, but I do.

66
00:06:11,137 --> 00:06:15,005
Of course I'm not serious.
I'm teasing you.

67
00:06:15,074 --> 00:06:18,339
Oh. Okay.

68
00:06:18,411 --> 00:06:20,242
So...

69
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:24,206
Of course I'm not serious.

70
00:06:25,284 --> 00:06:26,876
I was teasing you.

71
00:06:27,954 --> 00:06:30,422
Oh. Okay.

72
00:06:31,491 --> 00:06:33,152
Tyrone enters.

73
00:06:37,497 --> 00:06:39,124
Knock knock.

74
00:06:39,198 --> 00:06:41,063
We were just speaking of you.

75
00:06:41,134 --> 00:06:44,297
Nothing seemed particularly unusual

76
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:47,134
- in that first rehearsal.
- Well, I'm flattered.

77
00:06:48,674 --> 00:06:51,734
- What did you say?
- She was teasing me.

78
00:06:51,811 --> 00:06:54,837
- That's not very nice.
- Yeah, I know.

79
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:56,745
She said she was
gonna go away with you.

80
00:06:57,850 --> 00:06:59,477
Did she really?

81
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:03,580
Yes. Yes, I did. I told him that.

82
00:07:03,656 --> 00:07:06,716
Imagine my surprise.

83
00:07:06,793 --> 00:07:08,761
Imagine.

84
00:07:08,828 --> 00:07:11,228
Well, I imagine it surprised you.

85
00:07:12,565 --> 00:07:14,760
Sorry, maybe get up on

86
00:07:14,834 --> 00:07:17,496
"She said she was
going away with you."

87
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:21,165
You want to kind of test him,

88
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:24,403
Iinger, see if they're
hiding something.

89
00:07:24,477 --> 00:07:25,808
See if he reacts.

90
00:07:25,878 --> 00:07:29,279
So you wanna make it stronger,
challenge him.

91
00:07:29,348 --> 00:07:30,713
Okay.

92
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:37,053
- She was teasing me.
- Well, that's not nice.

93
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:38,954
She said

94
00:07:39,025 --> 00:07:40,925
she was gonna go away with you.

95
00:07:41,994 --> 00:07:43,188
Oh, she did?

96
00:07:43,262 --> 00:07:45,526
Never mind that.

97
00:07:45,598 --> 00:07:47,793
No, just stay seated. Sorry.

98
00:07:47,867 --> 00:07:49,562
Okay.

99
00:07:52,772 --> 00:07:54,171
Okay.

100
00:07:57,310 --> 00:08:00,143
You can't be serious--
you and him?

101
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:05,011
Of course I'm not serious.

102
00:08:05,084 --> 00:08:08,076
- I'm teasing you.
- Oh.

103
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:10,645
On that first night, of course,

104
00:08:13,359 --> 00:08:15,623
we didn't yet know who you were...

105
00:08:19,398 --> 00:08:21,423
or what you would do to us.

106
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:26,033
Just teasing, of course.

107
00:08:26,105 --> 00:08:27,470
Of course.

108
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:29,770
Or what you would do to me.

109
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:42,683
I'm sorry. So can--

110
00:08:42,755 --> 00:08:44,154
what's...

111
00:08:46,726 --> 00:08:49,126
I don't know.
What's going on between them?

112
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:50,685
What do you mean?

113
00:08:50,763 --> 00:08:52,856
I don't know.
I just-- I don't get it.

114
00:08:52,932 --> 00:08:55,332
I-- I don't-- it seems like
they're not saying anything.

115
00:08:58,604 --> 00:09:01,664
- Sorry. Never mind.
- No no, say.

116
00:09:01,741 --> 00:09:04,005
I don't-- do they know--
do they have any idea,

117
00:09:04,076 --> 00:09:07,637
- like, what's going on? Do--
- I don't, um--

118
00:09:08,948 --> 00:09:10,973
hmm. What do you--

119
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:13,348
- what are-- what are your thoughts?
- I think--

120
00:09:13,419 --> 00:09:15,751
- Yeah.
- It's not me. I don't--

121
00:09:15,821 --> 00:09:17,618
I mean, I just--

122
00:09:19,792 --> 00:09:22,420
I don't-- I just don't
really like 'em, I guess.

123
00:09:22,495 --> 00:09:25,396
Oh. Okay.

124
00:09:31,103 --> 00:09:32,434
Let me--

125
00:09:33,506 --> 00:09:35,133
I don't know.

126
00:09:46,352 --> 00:09:48,149
Anita was there too.

127
00:09:52,658 --> 00:09:54,125
There's passion. It's just,

128
00:09:54,193 --> 00:09:56,423
you know,

129
00:09:56,495 --> 00:09:59,555
- not for their spouses.
- Mm-hmm.

130
00:09:59,632 --> 00:10:03,363
Say you're looking at someone
but you're thinking of someone else--

131
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:06,735
or maybe you're
just thinking of yourself,

132
00:10:06,806 --> 00:10:08,740
or just nothing.

133
00:10:08,808 --> 00:10:11,140
Actually, I think
that's the most common

134
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:13,735
or the most pleasant thing to think--

135
00:10:13,813 --> 00:10:16,543
just think nothing,
if that's possible.

136
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:18,345
I think it is.

137
00:10:18,417 --> 00:10:21,875
You know.
Look, there's--

138
00:10:21,954 --> 00:10:24,821
there's something furtive that--

139
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:26,949
that gives you a thrill

140
00:10:27,026 --> 00:10:28,618
and the play is about that thrill.

141
00:10:28,694 --> 00:10:30,753
- What does furtive mean?
- Hidden.

142
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:33,822
- Secrets. You all have secrets.
- Yeah.

143
00:10:39,572 --> 00:10:41,972
Um, I'll be right back.

144
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:51,511
I don't know why, but I've never
been able to do hidden very well.

145
00:10:51,584 --> 00:10:54,052
I guess I'm just not
very good at secrets.

146
00:10:55,855 --> 00:10:57,322
Sure you are.

147
00:11:01,727 --> 00:11:03,319
You don't know her.

148
00:11:03,396 --> 00:11:04,954
Mmm, that's right, I don't,

149
00:11:05,031 --> 00:11:07,022
but I think she's good at secrets.

150
00:11:08,467 --> 00:11:09,798
I don't get it.

151
00:11:10,836 --> 00:11:12,360
Why would you say that?

152
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:15,265
You know why I would say that.

153
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:18,970
Mmm, do l-- no.
No, I really--

154
00:11:19,045 --> 00:11:20,808
I really don't.

155
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,609
- I don't get it.
- You don't?

156
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:24,775
- Hm-mmm.
- I think you do. I think you both do.

157
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:27,648
S-- sorry, I don't.

158
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:33,217
Excuse me.

159
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:43,699
- That was really weird, right?
- Oh my God.

160
00:11:43,769 --> 00:11:45,828
- That's not funny.
- No, I'm sorry.

161
00:11:45,905 --> 00:11:48,032
- It's not funny.
- Was that me? That was weird.

162
00:12:00,619 --> 00:12:02,143
- Hey.
- Hey.

163
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:04,951
- You okay?
- Yeah, sure. Why?

164
00:12:07,827 --> 00:12:09,556
It's nice to finally meet you.

165
00:12:10,629 --> 00:12:12,426
You too.

166
00:12:12,498 --> 00:12:14,466
- Yeah, I'll see you in a minute.
- See you.

167
00:12:27,813 --> 00:12:29,212
You missed--

168
00:12:29,281 --> 00:12:31,340
- you missed a strange thing.
- What?

169
00:12:32,551 --> 00:12:35,019
- Tell me.
- Tyrone was just--

170
00:12:35,087 --> 00:12:37,055
I don't know.
I think he was just playing around.

171
00:12:37,123 --> 00:12:39,455
Doing something. I don't--

172
00:12:39,525 --> 00:12:41,083
Hmm?

173
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:44,596
It's nothing. He was just--
I guess he was kidding.

174
00:12:44,663 --> 00:12:46,824
I don't know.
It was-- it was weird. It's fine.

175
00:12:46,899 --> 00:12:48,662
- It's fine.
- He's coming back.

176
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:52,237
Okay.

177
00:12:52,304 --> 00:12:55,467
- Whoo!
- Hey, everything okay?

178
00:12:55,541 --> 00:12:57,941
Yeah, fine.

179
00:12:58,010 --> 00:12:59,671
I didn't mean to upset you.

180
00:12:59,745 --> 00:13:00,973
Did l?

181
00:13:04,583 --> 00:13:07,177
- Did I upset you, Anita?
- It's-- I don't--

182
00:13:07,253 --> 00:13:10,552
I just really don't know
what you were saying.

183
00:13:11,657 --> 00:13:14,182
- Um...
- What happened?

184
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:15,921
- l--
- I missed it.

185
00:13:15,995 --> 00:13:19,226
I was teasing Anita and...

186
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:22,199
I think I was--
I was misunderstood.

187
00:13:22,268 --> 00:13:23,929
I-- I just--

188
00:13:24,003 --> 00:13:26,028
I'm clumsy sometimes.

189
00:13:26,105 --> 00:13:29,632
- l-- I don't mean to be.
- I don't know.

190
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:33,538
Sometimes it takes me
a little while to get

191
00:13:33,612 --> 00:13:35,443
the gears going and everything.

192
00:13:35,514 --> 00:13:37,812
You all seem like very nice people,

193
00:13:37,883 --> 00:13:39,851
I think.

194
00:13:40,953 --> 00:13:42,284
Gee, thanks.

195
00:13:43,389 --> 00:13:44,686
Yeah.

196
00:13:47,193 --> 00:13:49,753
Well, I'm certainly

197
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:53,161
glad that

198
00:13:53,232 --> 00:13:56,668
you all are doing this piece.

199
00:13:56,735 --> 00:13:58,032
I have a really good feeling about it

200
00:13:58,103 --> 00:14:00,128
and I just wanted to say cheers

201
00:14:00,206 --> 00:14:01,764
- to all of you.
- Cheers.

202
00:14:10,883 --> 00:14:14,546
Ah. So, Martine,

203
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:17,384
what did you think
of what you saw today?

204
00:14:19,325 --> 00:14:20,952
What did you think?

205
00:14:24,196 --> 00:14:25,959
well, I was curious why you chose

206
00:14:26,031 --> 00:14:29,660
to focus on these people,
because they don't--

207
00:14:29,735 --> 00:14:31,600
they don't seem very much like you.

208
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:33,638
You don't know her.

209
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:35,367
Oh, l-- l--

210
00:14:35,441 --> 00:14:37,170
That's true, Anita.
I don't.

211
00:14:37,243 --> 00:14:39,438
That's very--
that's very true.

212
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:44,882
Well, l-- I think they're interesting.

213
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:48,044
- Mm-hmm.
- Do you think they're interesting?

214
00:14:49,655 --> 00:14:51,122
Hmm.

215
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:53,983
Uh, yes, l-- probably, yeah.

216
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:55,651
They probably are.

217
00:14:57,196 --> 00:14:58,663
I don't get your point, Tyrone.

218
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:00,221
What-what-- what's your point?

219
00:15:03,335 --> 00:15:05,326
You know what it is?
I'm just tired.

220
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:06,928
I-- l--

221
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:10,098
I'm gonna excuse myself.

222
00:15:10,175 --> 00:15:11,642
Really?

223
00:15:13,012 --> 00:15:14,274
Yeah.

224
00:15:14,346 --> 00:15:16,780
- I'll see y'all later.
- See you tomorrow.

225
00:15:27,826 --> 00:15:30,090
He's a load of laughs.

226
00:15:42,808 --> 00:15:44,298
I like him.

227
00:16:10,202 --> 00:16:12,102
It's probably hard for him.

228
00:16:12,171 --> 00:16:14,230
We all know each other,
he's just coming in.

229
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:17,400
- Yeah.
- I'm sure he's intimidated by me.

230
00:16:19,912 --> 00:16:21,675
I'm sure he was.

231
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:45,163
I dreamt that I was under a tree.

232
00:17:22,241 --> 00:17:25,301
Oh, Tyrone. Hi.

233
00:17:30,082 --> 00:17:32,050
Where are you going?

234
00:17:40,592 --> 00:17:44,551
I was up all night,
but I think I was dreaming,

235
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:46,860
so I must've slept some.

236
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:58,543
Um, you like Julie?

237
00:18:00,045 --> 00:18:01,808
Yeah, I like Julie too.

238
00:18:57,569 --> 00:18:59,935
Now try it just--

239
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:02,973
just speaking the melody,

240
00:19:03,041 --> 00:19:04,770
- not-- not singing it.
- Not singing?

241
00:19:04,843 --> 00:19:06,071
- Great.
- You sure?

242
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:07,407
Oh yeah.

243
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:09,470
Okay. Ahem.

244
00:19:11,917 --> 00:19:13,714
I didn't know you.

245
00:19:13,785 --> 00:19:15,548
You didn't know me.

246
00:19:15,621 --> 00:19:18,954
- But now I can see you.
- You see what I see.

247
00:19:19,024 --> 00:19:21,288
- Now you're inside me...
- And I'm inside you...

248
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,123
-...and I'm inside you.
-...and you're inside me.

249
00:19:23,195 --> 00:19:25,254
- I sit here with her...
- I sit here with him.

250
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:28,356
...and I'm thinking of you
and you're thinking of me.

251
00:19:28,433 --> 00:19:30,833
And when we're together,
we know they're alone.

252
00:19:30,903 --> 00:19:32,803
- Not really alone.
- They're not really alone.

253
00:19:32,871 --> 00:19:35,362
- We know they're together...
- Like the earth and a stone.

254
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,374
-...Iike a dog and a bone.
- But I don't care.

255
00:19:37,442 --> 00:19:40,070
And I care less, 'cause
my hand's in yours.

256
00:19:40,145 --> 00:19:43,546
And it's touching my dress.

257
00:19:43,615 --> 00:19:46,049
Take me home, please.
You've got me all emotional.

258
00:19:46,118 --> 00:19:48,416
Take me home, please.
You've got me all emotional.

259
00:19:48,487 --> 00:19:53,186
Please don't take my piano player.
Well, for the record,

260
00:19:53,258 --> 00:19:55,055
- he's my piano player.
- Well, for the record,

261
00:19:55,127 --> 00:19:56,185
- he's my piano player.
- I like to think

262
00:19:56,261 --> 00:19:58,058
I'm everybody's piano player.

263
00:20:03,335 --> 00:20:05,326
- We know they're together...
- Like the earth and a stone.

264
00:20:05,404 --> 00:20:07,395
-...Iike a dog and a bone.
- But I don't care.

265
00:20:07,472 --> 00:20:10,498
And I care less,
'cause my hand's in yours.

266
00:20:10,576 --> 00:20:13,340
And it's touching my dress.

267
00:20:16,915 --> 00:20:19,247
Watching Anita onstage,

268
00:20:19,318 --> 00:20:21,616
I noticed something about her.

269
00:20:31,029 --> 00:20:33,361
I mentioned this to Raymond.

270
00:20:35,033 --> 00:20:38,366
I wouldn't say Anita's secretive.

271
00:20:38,437 --> 00:20:40,428
Anita is secret.

272
00:20:41,607 --> 00:20:43,302
Very much so.

273
00:20:48,981 --> 00:20:52,109
- Like you.
- No.

274
00:20:53,151 --> 00:20:55,745
No, I don't-- I don't think so.

275
00:20:55,821 --> 00:20:57,982
Hmm.

276
00:21:01,493 --> 00:21:03,324
Tyrone, though.

277
00:21:04,463 --> 00:21:06,795
He-- he has this--

278
00:21:06,865 --> 00:21:08,856
he has that thing too.

279
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:12,461
And you're right as usual, you know,

280
00:21:12,537 --> 00:21:14,266
and there is something about Anita

281
00:21:14,339 --> 00:21:17,274
that reminds me of-- of me.

282
00:21:17,342 --> 00:21:21,642
But I like it. I mean, there's nothing
wrong with having a secret.

283
00:21:22,748 --> 00:21:24,682
I hope I'm all right--

284
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:26,377
I mean for this.

285
00:21:26,451 --> 00:21:28,419
No, you're always fine.

286
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:38,028
But Tyrone, though...

287
00:21:41,166 --> 00:21:44,397
- You know, I have to say--
- No, I mean there's just something--

288
00:21:44,469 --> 00:21:47,131
he has this really sweet voice

289
00:21:47,205 --> 00:21:50,834
and he's just very protective of me.

290
00:21:54,279 --> 00:21:56,645
And then I heard birds.

291
00:22:11,063 --> 00:22:13,861
And the piano again.

292
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:24,238
I thought I heard someone say

293
00:22:24,309 --> 00:22:27,278
"What's she doing that's so strange?"

294
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:33,644
It might've been Anita's voice.

295
00:22:47,265 --> 00:22:49,665
I was in a field

296
00:22:52,237 --> 00:22:53,829
under a tree.

297
00:22:58,076 --> 00:23:01,603
I could see a man and a woman.

298
00:23:10,021 --> 00:23:12,785
I dreamt that I was writing a story

299
00:23:12,858 --> 00:23:15,258
about a man who followed me

300
00:23:15,327 --> 00:23:16,988
and watched me,

301
00:23:17,062 --> 00:23:19,189
even when I was sleeping.

302
00:23:21,466 --> 00:23:23,957
I put his hands on my breasts,

303
00:23:24,035 --> 00:23:26,663
and our lips touched.

304
00:23:30,108 --> 00:23:32,633
He is touching my thigh

305
00:23:36,348 --> 00:23:38,373
under my skirt.

306
00:23:39,451 --> 00:23:40,748
Higher.

307
00:23:42,154 --> 00:23:44,281
He's staring at me.

308
00:23:46,291 --> 00:23:49,590
- Martine.
- I can hear him.

309
00:23:51,763 --> 00:23:52,991
Martine.

310
00:23:53,064 --> 00:23:55,464
- Huh?
- I can hear his footsteps.

311
00:23:55,534 --> 00:23:57,764
- Hey.
- Hi.

312
00:23:59,204 --> 00:24:00,671
You were mumbling.

313
00:24:00,739 --> 00:24:04,038
- Oh. Really?
- Yeah, you were dreaming.

314
00:24:05,577 --> 00:24:09,206
I was dreaming
that I was writing a story.

315
00:24:10,348 --> 00:24:12,339
We should go.

316
00:24:13,852 --> 00:24:16,548
- The new pages?
- Mm-hmm.

317
00:24:17,989 --> 00:24:20,116
I was being followed.

318
00:24:21,993 --> 00:24:23,517
Followed when?

319
00:24:23,595 --> 00:24:27,292
In the dream, in the story.

320
00:24:27,365 --> 00:24:29,560
I put his hand on my breast

321
00:24:29,634 --> 00:24:31,625
and our lips touched.

322
00:24:32,838 --> 00:24:34,567
It was just a dream.

323
00:24:59,130 --> 00:25:01,724
Something was happening to me.

324
00:25:12,277 --> 00:25:14,472
Oh God.

325
00:25:14,546 --> 00:25:16,207
New pages.

326
00:25:16,281 --> 00:25:18,749
- Oh, thank you.
- Julie.

327
00:25:18,817 --> 00:25:20,182
Thanks.

328
00:25:26,358 --> 00:25:28,121
- Raymond.
- Hmm?

329
00:25:28,193 --> 00:25:29,854
I-- I know it's a whisper,

330
00:25:29,928 --> 00:25:31,555
but I'm gonna need to hear it.

331
00:25:31,630 --> 00:25:33,029
I'm sorry.
It's just tricky.

332
00:25:33,098 --> 00:25:35,362
So can you take it from that line again?

333
00:25:35,433 --> 00:25:37,867
Um, what do you mean?

334
00:25:37,936 --> 00:25:40,097
She's acting more and more strange.

335
00:25:40,171 --> 00:25:43,436
I think she must know

336
00:25:43,508 --> 00:25:45,237
and she doesn't know what to do.

337
00:25:45,310 --> 00:25:47,141
So she's, you know--

338
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:50,705
what is she doing that's so strange?

339
00:25:50,782 --> 00:25:52,943
- Again.
- What again?

340
00:25:53,018 --> 00:25:54,883
That line-- read it again.

341
00:25:56,655 --> 00:25:57,986
I think she must know

342
00:25:58,056 --> 00:25:59,353
and she doesn't know what to do,

343
00:25:59,424 --> 00:26:01,392
so she's, you know--

344
00:26:02,727 --> 00:26:05,059
what is she doing that's so strange?

345
00:26:10,535 --> 00:26:13,333
And then I saw Anita watching me.

346
00:26:43,735 --> 00:26:46,169
What is she doing that's so strange?

347
00:26:46,237 --> 00:26:48,797
She's watching me,

348
00:26:48,873 --> 00:26:50,363
- all the time.
- Raymond.

349
00:26:50,442 --> 00:26:52,535
She's watching me, all the time.

350
00:26:52,611 --> 00:26:54,670
- Stand closer.
- Like-- you--

351
00:26:54,746 --> 00:26:57,374
- Clo-- closer than this?
- Yeah.

352
00:26:57,449 --> 00:26:59,076
Please, closer.

353
00:27:00,151 --> 00:27:01,175
She's--

354
00:27:02,554 --> 00:27:04,920
she's watching me, all the time.

355
00:27:04,990 --> 00:27:07,481
Like when I'm just reading, or even...

356
00:27:42,894 --> 00:27:44,623
I don't remember that scene

357
00:27:44,696 --> 00:27:46,596
in the play ending.

358
00:27:50,835 --> 00:27:53,326
Everyone was just quiet.

359
00:28:27,639 --> 00:28:30,938
That night,
Raymond was out late.

360
00:28:32,711 --> 00:28:35,612
I had a headache for two days,

361
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:38,205
so I looked for some aspirin.

362
00:28:39,517 --> 00:28:41,576
I couldn't find any.

363
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:52,679
The next morning,
I went to meet a journalist I knew.

364
00:30:00,999 --> 00:30:04,958
- Martine.
- Oh. Hi, Elizabeth.

365
00:30:07,639 --> 00:30:09,698
You looked like
you were somewhere else.

366
00:30:12,544 --> 00:30:13,806
Yeah.

367
00:30:15,079 --> 00:30:17,513
- How are you?
- I'm-- I'm pretty good.

368
00:30:17,582 --> 00:30:20,847
It's good to see you.
God, how long has it been?

369
00:30:20,919 --> 00:30:22,944
- What, like--
- Well, let me see.

370
00:30:23,021 --> 00:30:25,182
I-- the last piece I did on you was

371
00:30:25,256 --> 00:30:27,781
January-- two years ago.

372
00:30:27,859 --> 00:30:29,520
As she spoke,

373
00:30:29,594 --> 00:30:33,189
it occurred to me that
I had no idea who she was.

374
00:30:46,578 --> 00:30:49,513
I had recognized her name
when she called,

375
00:30:49,581 --> 00:30:52,550
but I couldn't remember
ever seeing her before.

376
00:30:53,818 --> 00:30:55,786
Like last time,
I'm just gonna record it.

377
00:30:55,854 --> 00:30:57,685
- That's okay?
- That-- that's fine.

378
00:30:57,755 --> 00:30:59,347
Okay.

379
00:30:59,424 --> 00:31:02,450
Interview with Martine Jamison,
May 1 1th.

380
00:31:02,527 --> 00:31:05,360
She wanted to know about the new play.

381
00:31:09,834 --> 00:31:14,066
So it's-- it's a workshop, so-- so--

382
00:31:15,974 --> 00:31:18,568
so things-- things change.

383
00:31:18,643 --> 00:31:21,441
Everything is still trying to change.

384
00:31:26,751 --> 00:31:29,083
It wouldn't surprise me if...

385
00:31:39,664 --> 00:31:42,827
Um, same group that l--

386
00:31:42,901 --> 00:31:45,995
same group that
I've worked with before,

387
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:49,597
plus Tyrone Devlin has joined us.

388
00:31:49,674 --> 00:31:52,507
- I don't know him.
- Oh, he works a lot, I think.

389
00:31:52,577 --> 00:31:55,910
He's-- he's really very good.

390
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:58,847
Um, very good.

391
00:32:00,852 --> 00:32:02,820
Why would I poison her?

392
00:32:02,887 --> 00:32:04,149
You tell me.

393
00:32:05,356 --> 00:32:07,221
You're deluded.

394
00:32:16,367 --> 00:32:18,460
There's, um,

395
00:32:18,536 --> 00:32:21,027
a festival in Japan that...

396
00:32:25,376 --> 00:32:26,968
There's, um,

397
00:32:27,045 --> 00:32:29,309
a festival in Japan that...

398
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:31,405
really interests me.

399
00:32:31,482 --> 00:32:35,475
Some people write letters to the dead.

400
00:32:35,553 --> 00:32:38,784
And when you write a letter
to someone who has died--

401
00:32:38,856 --> 00:32:42,155
And when you write
a letter to someone who has died--

402
00:32:42,226 --> 00:32:46,663
in Japan, they put it
in this little wooden boat

403
00:32:46,731 --> 00:32:48,494
and it drifts off.

404
00:32:48,566 --> 00:32:51,057
So has the person
who's written the letter

405
00:32:51,135 --> 00:32:53,035
spoken to the dead?

406
00:32:53,104 --> 00:32:57,040
- I think maybe, you know--
- I mean, I'd say yes.

407
00:32:57,108 --> 00:32:59,406
I mean, I'd say yes.

408
00:32:59,477 --> 00:33:01,502
Their-- their minds,
through the letters,

409
00:33:01,579 --> 00:33:03,308
en-- enter...

410
00:33:05,383 --> 00:33:08,113
um, a world that's not living.

411
00:33:09,187 --> 00:33:12,088
But the mind is alive if

412
00:33:12,156 --> 00:33:16,354
and only if their writing is sincere.

413
00:33:17,562 --> 00:33:20,258
And in this way--

414
00:33:20,331 --> 00:33:23,732
and in this way,
that world-- the dead world--

415
00:33:23,801 --> 00:33:26,167
is brought into life and it--

416
00:33:26,237 --> 00:33:29,365
and so-- so it lives. Um...

417
00:33:43,021 --> 00:33:45,285
I'm thinking of a new element.

418
00:33:45,356 --> 00:33:47,722
- For the play?
- Yeah, for the play.

419
00:33:48,926 --> 00:33:50,757
Do you know what

420
00:33:50,828 --> 00:33:52,819
copper supplements are used for?

421
00:33:53,931 --> 00:33:55,592
No, I don't.

422
00:33:55,666 --> 00:33:57,224
Well,

423
00:33:57,301 --> 00:33:58,962
copper is a--

424
00:34:00,538 --> 00:34:03,507
it's present in the body.
It's an element.

425
00:34:03,574 --> 00:34:06,509
You actually need it
for your body to function,

426
00:34:06,577 --> 00:34:09,512
so people take copper supplements.

427
00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:12,242
But if you take too much,

428
00:34:12,316 --> 00:34:13,908
it-- it can--

429
00:34:15,453 --> 00:34:18,445
If you take too much,
it can lead to schizophrenia.

430
00:34:19,891 --> 00:34:21,449
I didn't know that.

431
00:34:21,526 --> 00:34:25,724
Yeah, it's clinically been known
to lead to schizophrenia.

432
00:34:26,998 --> 00:34:29,967
Yeah. Well, it's--
it's kind of a--

433
00:34:30,034 --> 00:34:33,561
a specialized kind--
kind of knowledge.

434
00:34:35,139 --> 00:34:38,802
I'm changing the names
of the characters in the play

435
00:34:38,876 --> 00:34:40,969
to be the names of the actors--

436
00:34:41,045 --> 00:34:42,945
the actual actors playing them.

437
00:34:43,014 --> 00:34:45,676
I didn't want her to look at me anymore.

438
00:34:54,025 --> 00:34:56,425
You know what? I, uh--

439
00:34:58,062 --> 00:34:59,996
I have this headache.

440
00:35:03,067 --> 00:35:06,833
Do you think
we could finish this later?

441
00:35:06,904 --> 00:35:08,872
Tomo-- maybe tomorrow even?

442
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:10,703
Of course.

443
00:35:10,775 --> 00:35:12,868
Can I get you anything?

444
00:35:12,944 --> 00:35:15,242
No no.
That's very kind.

445
00:35:15,313 --> 00:35:18,714
I'm just, uh-- l--

446
00:35:18,783 --> 00:35:21,251
I'll call you and we can

447
00:35:21,319 --> 00:35:23,787
figure out a time.

448
00:35:23,855 --> 00:35:26,949
Thank you for understanding.

449
00:35:27,024 --> 00:35:28,685
I'm sorry about this.

450
00:35:30,328 --> 00:35:32,125
Um, bye.

451
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:52,345
As you know,
I continued to write the play.

452
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,147
You've all been, uh,

453
00:35:57,221 --> 00:35:59,155
really patient with the new pages.

454
00:35:59,223 --> 00:36:02,681
So thank you.
It's very helpful to me.

455
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:05,729
Wow. What happened?

456
00:36:05,796 --> 00:36:08,128
- All the songs are out?
- Yeah.

457
00:36:08,199 --> 00:36:11,191
And your characters have new names.

458
00:36:12,770 --> 00:36:15,864
I'm sort of losing my bearings here.

459
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:18,738
It's like an entirely different play.

460
00:36:18,809 --> 00:36:21,607
Yeah, well,
that's the idea of a workshop--

461
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:22,907
things change.

462
00:36:24,115 --> 00:36:28,017
I know that's the idea, Tyrone.

463
00:36:28,085 --> 00:36:30,451
- Good.
- I mean, we're just simply--

464
00:36:30,521 --> 00:36:34,252
just gonna see what happens.
You know, see where it goes.

465
00:36:35,493 --> 00:36:37,222
Yeah, that sounds good to me.

466
00:36:37,295 --> 00:36:38,853
Yeah, so...

467
00:36:40,364 --> 00:36:42,559
see where-- where it takes us.

468
00:36:42,633 --> 00:36:45,363
- Great. That's-- that's fine.
- Okay.

469
00:36:46,404 --> 00:36:47,894
Thanks, guys.

470
00:36:59,283 --> 00:37:00,750
You're deluded.

471
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:04,817
Or maybe you're not.
Maybe you're using

472
00:37:04,889 --> 00:37:08,120
this accusation to mask
some sickness of your own.

473
00:37:09,794 --> 00:37:12,456
It's pathetic.

474
00:37:12,530 --> 00:37:14,225
That happens, you know.

475
00:37:20,671 --> 00:37:23,071
Why would I poison her?

476
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:25,608
I don't know, Raymond. Why?

477
00:37:32,450 --> 00:37:33,917
Go to hell.

478
00:37:37,154 --> 00:37:40,385
Uh, can you take
that again, Raymond?

479
00:37:40,458 --> 00:37:43,393
- It happens, you know.
- No, from "You're deluded."

480
00:37:43,461 --> 00:37:45,952
And you know

481
00:37:46,030 --> 00:37:48,294
that he knows that you're lying.

482
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:51,891
Oh, I wasn't so sure that I was lying.

483
00:37:51,969 --> 00:37:54,597
You are, and he knows you are.

484
00:37:54,672 --> 00:37:56,697
So--

485
00:37:58,309 --> 00:38:00,209
I don't know, that's--
that's kinda going

486
00:38:00,278 --> 00:38:03,304
a long way from a flirtation.
Now I'm poisoning my wife?

487
00:38:03,381 --> 00:38:05,781
I mean-- l--
I don't mean to be rude.

488
00:38:05,850 --> 00:38:07,613
I just-- I just don't know,

489
00:38:07,685 --> 00:38:09,653
but I think it's interesting.

490
00:38:12,690 --> 00:38:14,783
All right.

491
00:38:19,430 --> 00:38:21,295
You're deluded.
Or maybe you're not.

492
00:38:21,365 --> 00:38:22,957
Maybe you're using this accusation

493
00:38:23,034 --> 00:38:24,763
to mask some sickness of your own.

494
00:38:24,835 --> 00:38:28,271
- I'm don't-- I don't get this.
- It's pathetic.

495
00:38:35,212 --> 00:38:36,372
Go to hell.

496
00:38:36,447 --> 00:38:38,642
No, Raymond, you go to hell.

497
00:38:38,716 --> 00:38:40,547
Okay.

498
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:45,753
Yeah, let's take--

499
00:38:45,823 --> 00:38:48,189
take five minutes.

500
00:38:48,259 --> 00:38:50,955
Raymond, can I talk
to you for a sec?

501
00:39:12,817 --> 00:39:16,275
Why are you taking so much copper?

502
00:39:16,354 --> 00:39:18,322
What do you mean?

503
00:39:18,389 --> 00:39:21,881
You have about 20 bottles
of copper in your gym bag.

504
00:39:23,194 --> 00:39:25,219
I don't have any... copper.

505
00:39:25,296 --> 00:39:27,491
You know-- you know that.
Why are you saying that?

506
00:39:27,565 --> 00:39:29,999
Raymond, l-- I saw it.

507
00:39:30,067 --> 00:39:32,160
It's in your gym bag.
I saw it.

508
00:39:33,637 --> 00:39:36,367
Sweetheart,
I don't have any copper. I...

509
00:39:48,018 --> 00:39:49,781
I just don't get it.

510
00:39:52,957 --> 00:39:55,425
I just want you to tell me the truth.

511
00:39:58,462 --> 00:40:00,726
- That's all.
- Just in case you're wondering,

512
00:40:00,798 --> 00:40:02,698
I don't mind if you
go through my stuff.

513
00:40:02,767 --> 00:40:05,065
Just in case you're wondering.

514
00:41:03,294 --> 00:41:06,161
Like a curtain had been pulled back,

515
00:41:06,230 --> 00:41:10,064
I could suddenly see what was
really happening on the stage.

516
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:40,394
I don't like being so close
to you and having to pretend.

517
00:41:40,464 --> 00:41:42,728
I know.

518
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:45,132
She's listening to us right now.

519
00:41:45,202 --> 00:41:47,466
I can feel it.

520
00:42:13,430 --> 00:42:15,694
I know you could see it too.

521
00:42:27,878 --> 00:42:29,402
You're using this accusation

522
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:31,573
to mask some perversion
of your own.

523
00:42:31,649 --> 00:42:33,947
It's pathetic.

524
00:42:34,018 --> 00:42:35,747
It happens you know.

525
00:42:35,819 --> 00:42:38,117
It's not very original,

526
00:42:38,188 --> 00:42:40,383
- if that's what you're doing.
- It's not what I'm doing.

527
00:42:47,464 --> 00:42:49,728
I didn't expect to find you here.

528
00:42:52,436 --> 00:42:54,961
I think everybody could see it.

529
00:43:01,946 --> 00:43:03,413
Hello.

530
00:43:04,915 --> 00:43:06,815
I came early.
Is that all right?

531
00:43:11,589 --> 00:43:13,580
- Who didn't you expect?
- Me.

532
00:43:13,657 --> 00:43:16,182
We were just picking
a suitcase for you to take.

533
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:19,423
Mmm. Is everything okay?

534
00:43:19,496 --> 00:43:21,327
Sure, why not?

535
00:43:25,703 --> 00:43:28,501
Uh, oh, in case you're wondering,
no, I don't--

536
00:43:28,572 --> 00:43:30,403
I don't mind, yeah,
if you go through my things.

537
00:43:30,474 --> 00:43:32,772
It's fine. Just in case
you were wondering.

538
00:43:34,411 --> 00:43:38,211
- So, ready to go?
- No, I can't go today.

539
00:43:38,282 --> 00:43:40,876
- My-- my wrist--
- It's still hurting?

540
00:43:40,951 --> 00:43:42,418
- A little bit.
- Yeah.

541
00:43:44,822 --> 00:43:46,847
Maybe you should take
something for it.

542
00:43:47,958 --> 00:43:49,892
No, I don't like to.

543
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:51,757
- Oh.
- I'll just rest it awhile longer,

544
00:43:51,829 --> 00:43:54,957
- just to be sure.
- Good.

545
00:43:55,032 --> 00:43:57,296
All right, well,
maybe I'll just go by myself.

546
00:43:57,368 --> 00:43:58,733
Are you, uh,

547
00:43:59,870 --> 00:44:01,633
two gonna be okay here together?

548
00:44:01,705 --> 00:44:03,866
Are you sure?

549
00:44:16,620 --> 00:44:19,282
Yeah, I'm-- I'm sure, I'm sure.

550
00:44:19,356 --> 00:44:21,415
Uh, could I just,
um, uh--

551
00:44:21,492 --> 00:44:24,086
Martine, do you think
Raymond should stand over by me?

552
00:44:24,161 --> 00:44:26,561
Just so we can, you know,
like, face Tyrone together

553
00:44:26,630 --> 00:44:29,030
- or-- because--
- Sure. Why not?

554
00:44:29,099 --> 00:44:31,727
I'll just get my things.

555
00:44:31,802 --> 00:44:33,463
I'll just get
my things.

556
00:44:33,537 --> 00:44:36,062
- Should I drive him?
- Hey, Anita.

557
00:44:36,140 --> 00:44:38,574
Raymond wants you closer to him.

558
00:44:43,247 --> 00:44:44,646
I thought l-- that's okay.

559
00:44:47,217 --> 00:44:48,616
Okay.

560
00:44:50,254 --> 00:44:52,347
And Tyrone comes back in.

561
00:45:04,935 --> 00:45:07,267
Okay then.

562
00:45:08,772 --> 00:45:10,899
You know,
I think I'm gonna take off.

563
00:45:10,974 --> 00:45:12,965
Hey, don't leave on my account.

564
00:45:13,043 --> 00:45:15,341
He's not.

565
00:45:15,412 --> 00:45:17,312
I should get home anyway.

566
00:45:17,381 --> 00:45:20,680
- My wife's expecting me.
- Yeah well,

567
00:45:20,751 --> 00:45:23,083
maybe you should take
something for that wrist.

568
00:45:23,153 --> 00:45:25,018
Bye.

569
00:45:35,933 --> 00:45:38,128
Oh, Julie, hi.

570
00:45:42,673 --> 00:45:45,164
No, all by myself.

571
00:45:47,411 --> 00:45:49,436
Just woke up from a nap.

572
00:45:50,481 --> 00:45:52,176
Nope, just me.
Okay, bye.

573
00:45:53,517 --> 00:45:54,916
All right.

574
00:45:57,421 --> 00:45:58,581
Good.

575
00:45:58,655 --> 00:46:01,123
Um, Tyrone.

576
00:46:02,793 --> 00:46:04,124
It's good,

577
00:46:09,733 --> 00:46:12,258
Iike, you're aware
of what they're doing.

578
00:46:13,303 --> 00:46:14,895
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

579
00:46:14,972 --> 00:46:17,964
It's like you know
what they're doing behind your back.

580
00:46:18,041 --> 00:46:20,271
Whatever that is.

581
00:46:23,547 --> 00:46:24,707
Uh-huh.

582
00:46:24,782 --> 00:46:27,876
But you don't confront them,

583
00:46:27,951 --> 00:46:29,384
'cause you don't need to.

584
00:46:29,453 --> 00:46:32,149
Yeah, I'm-I'm--
I'm taunting them.

585
00:46:32,222 --> 00:46:34,656
- Right.
- I feel taunted.

586
00:46:34,725 --> 00:46:36,283
Interesting.

587
00:46:37,327 --> 00:46:39,989
- Why?
- That you feel taunted.

588
00:46:40,063 --> 00:46:44,466
- Why is that interesting, Martine?
- I think it's interesting.

589
00:46:44,535 --> 00:46:47,060
That you feel taunted,
that you would choose that word.

590
00:46:47,137 --> 00:46:49,071
Why is that interesting?
I don't-- I mean l--

591
00:46:49,139 --> 00:46:50,401
- Just that--
- I didn't choose that word.

592
00:46:50,474 --> 00:46:52,271
Tyrone chose that word.

593
00:46:52,342 --> 00:46:55,243
Yeah. Yeah, I guess--
I guess he did.

594
00:46:57,214 --> 00:46:59,182
Sorry, did you say
something, Raymond?

595
00:47:00,517 --> 00:47:02,041
No.

596
00:47:02,119 --> 00:47:04,280
I'm-- no.
I just-- I didn't--

597
00:47:04,354 --> 00:47:06,151
what did you say?

598
00:47:06,223 --> 00:47:08,453
Wh-- what?
I didn't say anything.

599
00:47:12,830 --> 00:47:15,355
I thought you--
what did you say?

600
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:20,401
Oh, I thought I heard
you say something.

601
00:47:20,470 --> 00:47:24,600
- What? You didn't say anything?
- N-- no.

602
00:47:24,675 --> 00:47:26,609
What did--
what did you think I said?

603
00:47:26,677 --> 00:47:29,145
I don't know.
I don't know what you said.

604
00:47:30,681 --> 00:47:32,114
Oh boy.

605
00:47:34,051 --> 00:47:37,077
Uh, right.

606
00:47:39,389 --> 00:47:41,448
Maybe we should take a break.

607
00:47:41,525 --> 00:47:44,289
Yeah. You know, I'm--

608
00:47:44,361 --> 00:47:46,192
I don't know.
I'm a little tired.

609
00:47:46,263 --> 00:47:50,290
And, uh, look,
you guys, l--

610
00:47:51,335 --> 00:47:52,893
I know we just got here,

611
00:47:52,970 --> 00:47:55,404
but l-l-l-- I think I'm--

612
00:47:55,472 --> 00:47:57,633
just need to call it a night.

613
00:47:57,708 --> 00:47:59,801
But please

614
00:47:59,877 --> 00:48:02,778
just, uh, continue

615
00:48:02,846 --> 00:48:05,041
working without me.
I-- I just--

616
00:48:07,284 --> 00:48:08,979
Do you need something?

617
00:48:09,052 --> 00:48:11,486
No no no, I'm-- I just--

618
00:48:11,555 --> 00:48:14,115
I just need to get home.

619
00:48:14,191 --> 00:48:16,625
Just continue doing
what you're doing.

620
00:48:16,693 --> 00:48:19,628
Uh, yeah. Huh.

621
00:48:19,696 --> 00:48:24,030
I am-- I'm really confused
about the-- this--

622
00:48:24,101 --> 00:48:26,695
You know, you and Raymond
figure it out.

623
00:48:43,820 --> 00:48:46,118
Maybe you can direct for a while, Anita.

624
00:48:47,524 --> 00:48:48,821
Fuck you.

625
00:49:06,510 --> 00:49:08,444
Do you think
she's gonna be all right?

626
00:49:10,347 --> 00:49:12,247
I don't know.

627
00:49:12,316 --> 00:49:13,647
What do you think?

628
00:49:15,252 --> 00:49:16,651
You know her best.

629
00:49:19,089 --> 00:49:20,556
Listen.

630
00:49:21,825 --> 00:49:23,816
I know you're friends
with Tyrone, but...

631
00:49:26,430 --> 00:49:29,661
have you noticed
the way he is with Martine?

632
00:49:31,034 --> 00:49:32,865
Noticed what?

633
00:49:35,605 --> 00:49:37,869
- What, Raymond?
- Yeah, I just--

634
00:49:37,941 --> 00:49:39,932
I can't figure him out.

635
00:49:41,745 --> 00:49:44,077
Well, he's strange.

636
00:49:44,147 --> 00:49:45,705
So what?

637
00:49:47,217 --> 00:49:49,151
So nothing, I guess.

638
00:49:59,129 --> 00:50:01,791
Hi, I'm Detective Roberts.

639
00:50:01,865 --> 00:50:03,696
This is Detective Abrams.

640
00:50:03,767 --> 00:50:07,999
Are you the Martine Jamison
that was interviewed yesterday

641
00:50:08,071 --> 00:50:10,005
- by Elizabeth Holladay?
- Yeah.

642
00:50:10,073 --> 00:50:12,769
The next morning I woke up alone.

643
00:50:12,843 --> 00:50:15,038
- Can we come in?
- Yeah, sure.

644
00:50:28,392 --> 00:50:30,326
Elizabeth Holladay was struck

645
00:50:30,394 --> 00:50:33,295
by a car yesterday
just after you two spoke.

646
00:50:33,363 --> 00:50:35,194
Oh my God.

647
00:50:35,265 --> 00:50:37,631
Um, how is she?

648
00:50:37,701 --> 00:50:40,898
She's not doing that well.

649
00:50:40,971 --> 00:50:43,201
She's in a coma at St. Vincent's.

650
00:50:43,273 --> 00:50:44,831
She's in critical condition.

651
00:50:44,908 --> 00:50:47,342
Oh. My God.

652
00:50:47,411 --> 00:50:50,403
I-- I didn't know her that well.

653
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:52,141
- She was just--
- If it's okay,

654
00:50:52,215 --> 00:50:54,479
I'd like to ask you just
a couple of questions.

655
00:50:54,551 --> 00:50:56,815
- Um, It was a hit and run...
- Oh.

656
00:50:56,887 --> 00:50:58,718
...so we're trying
to see if we can't make

657
00:50:58,789 --> 00:51:00,814
some progress toward
identifying the driver.

658
00:51:00,891 --> 00:51:02,688
It's just a few questions.

659
00:51:02,759 --> 00:51:05,159
- Sure.
- Umm...

660
00:51:05,228 --> 00:51:08,095
she had a tape player
running in her purse

661
00:51:08,165 --> 00:51:10,690
when she was hit.

662
00:51:10,767 --> 00:51:12,735
We hear some voices in it
and I just--

663
00:51:12,803 --> 00:51:15,670
I wonder
if you can recognize this voice.

664
00:51:18,275 --> 00:51:21,403
I'll call you and we can--

665
00:51:21,478 --> 00:51:23,070
Sorry.

666
00:51:24,114 --> 00:51:25,513
That's me.

667
00:51:30,353 --> 00:51:32,878
She answered a cellphone call
just before the accident.

668
00:51:33,924 --> 00:51:35,915
Hello? Oh, hi.

669
00:51:35,992 --> 00:51:37,789
No, she just left.

670
00:51:37,861 --> 00:51:39,886
She said she wasn't feeling well.

671
00:51:39,963 --> 00:51:41,897
She mentioned you--
about the new piece.

672
00:51:41,965 --> 00:51:43,626
Yeah, and...

673
00:51:45,535 --> 00:51:47,162
Oh God.

674
00:51:47,237 --> 00:51:49,603
Oh my God.

675
00:51:51,641 --> 00:51:54,769
She mentioned you-- about the new piece.
Yeah, and the theater.

676
00:51:57,948 --> 00:52:00,644
That voice, the man--

677
00:52:00,717 --> 00:52:04,244
- you recognize it?
- No. Who is it?

678
00:52:04,321 --> 00:52:07,222
It may have been the voice
of someone in the car.

679
00:52:08,425 --> 00:52:10,188
We don't know.

680
00:52:13,263 --> 00:52:16,061
I have no-- l-l-- I don't know.

681
00:52:16,133 --> 00:52:18,260
I'm sorry. I--

682
00:52:18,335 --> 00:52:19,700
All right.

683
00:52:21,771 --> 00:52:24,239
If you can think of anything--

684
00:52:24,307 --> 00:52:27,242
- Thank you.
- Thank you for your time.

685
00:52:28,845 --> 00:52:31,575
And then one day, you and l--

686
00:52:31,648 --> 00:52:35,778
I think it was us--
had a talk in your apartment.

687
00:52:35,852 --> 00:52:38,514
And you said that you liked

688
00:52:38,588 --> 00:52:42,046
- that most people couldn't see you.
- That's weird.

689
00:52:42,125 --> 00:52:45,526
- I think it was us.
- No, it's not.

690
00:52:47,631 --> 00:52:51,032
Yeah, it is, actually, a little.

691
00:52:56,773 --> 00:52:58,604
Hey, there's Raymond.

692
00:53:02,245 --> 00:53:04,179
Is Martine with him?

693
00:53:04,247 --> 00:53:05,714
No.

694
00:53:05,782 --> 00:53:08,182
Hey, d-- don't.

695
00:53:12,322 --> 00:53:15,052
I don't know what your problem
with him is. He's a good guy.

696
00:53:18,461 --> 00:53:19,894
I'm sorry you think that.

697
00:53:21,398 --> 00:53:24,060
No reason to be sorry, Tyrone.

698
00:53:25,268 --> 00:53:27,395
I know him. He is.

699
00:53:35,011 --> 00:53:36,239
No.

700
00:53:40,483 --> 00:53:42,007
He's really not.

701
00:53:47,591 --> 00:53:49,286
You don't know him.

702
00:53:54,331 --> 00:53:55,821
What are you doing?

703
00:54:08,044 --> 00:54:10,012
You think I'm a nice guy?

704
00:54:15,585 --> 00:54:16,950
No.

705
00:54:19,990 --> 00:54:22,823
- Yes.
- Why?

706
00:54:33,003 --> 00:54:34,971
I didn't ask you if I could do this.

707
00:54:37,907 --> 00:54:39,772
No.

708
00:54:41,711 --> 00:54:43,338
I just did it.

709
00:54:45,915 --> 00:54:47,780
Yes.

710
00:55:53,717 --> 00:55:55,514
You okay?

711
00:55:57,253 --> 00:55:59,084
Yeah.

712
00:56:01,424 --> 00:56:03,483
'Cause you knew what
was happening to you.

713
00:56:06,096 --> 00:56:08,963
Well, what if that was happening
to you and you didn't know?

714
00:56:14,804 --> 00:56:17,602
I don't really know what you mean.

715
00:56:28,385 --> 00:56:31,149
Are you sure that I can borrow these?

716
00:56:31,221 --> 00:56:33,815
- I promise I'm a really good driver.
- Yeah.

717
00:56:33,890 --> 00:56:35,858
I said you could take it.

718
00:56:43,133 --> 00:56:45,431
You're wrong about Raymond.

719
00:56:55,779 --> 00:56:56,803
Anyway,

720
00:56:56,880 --> 00:57:00,338
uh, thanks for the, uh...

721
00:57:00,417 --> 00:57:02,248
affection.

722
00:57:16,099 --> 00:57:18,158
- Hello?
- Hello, Martine.

723
00:57:18,234 --> 00:57:20,293
It's Elizabeth Holladay.

724
00:57:20,370 --> 00:57:23,771
- Elizabeth?
- Yes.

725
00:57:25,675 --> 00:57:27,643
Martine?

726
00:57:28,845 --> 00:57:30,813
This is Martine.

727
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:33,371
This is Elizabeth Holladay, Martine.

728
00:57:34,517 --> 00:57:37,543
Yes. Uh, are you okay?

729
00:57:37,620 --> 00:57:41,021
- Where are you?
- I'm in my office.

730
00:57:41,090 --> 00:57:44,253
Yes, I'm fine.
Is everything all right?

731
00:57:44,327 --> 00:57:48,525
Um, yes, l-- I'm sorry.

732
00:57:48,598 --> 00:57:52,398
Elizabeth, were you
in an accident yesterday?

733
00:57:52,469 --> 00:57:55,563
No. No, I saw you yesterday.

734
00:57:55,638 --> 00:57:56,900
Are you all right?

735
00:57:58,508 --> 00:58:00,032
No, every-- everything's fine.

736
00:58:00,109 --> 00:58:01,872
I just need to, uh,

737
00:58:01,945 --> 00:58:06,041
figure out a time to--
with my schedule,

738
00:58:06,115 --> 00:58:10,381
um, so we can set up another time.

739
00:58:10,453 --> 00:58:12,717
I-l-l-- I'm gonna go now, Elizabeth.

740
00:58:12,789 --> 00:58:14,313
I've gotta hang up.

741
00:58:26,870 --> 00:58:29,498
- Anita.
- Yes?

742
00:58:31,007 --> 00:58:32,872
Nothing. Are you ready?

743
00:58:32,942 --> 00:58:34,637
- No, I'm not going.
- Oh.

744
00:58:34,711 --> 00:58:37,043
I'm staying here with Anita.
I hope you don't mind.

745
00:58:39,782 --> 00:58:42,774
Oh. I didn't expect
to find you here.

746
00:58:42,852 --> 00:58:45,150
But I am.

747
00:58:45,221 --> 00:58:48,713
- Anita.
- Yes?

748
00:58:48,791 --> 00:58:50,816
Nothing.
Are you ready?

749
00:58:50,894 --> 00:58:52,885
- No, I'm not going.
- Oh.

750
00:58:52,962 --> 00:58:55,487
I'm staying here with Anita.
I hope you don't mind.

751
00:58:57,166 --> 00:58:58,793
Anita.

752
00:59:00,470 --> 00:59:02,267
Anita.

753
00:59:03,640 --> 00:59:05,164
You keep saying that.

754
00:59:05,241 --> 00:59:07,266
Martine, I'm a little lost.
I'm sorry, guys.

755
00:59:07,343 --> 00:59:08,867
It just-- I don't-- I don't--

756
00:59:10,346 --> 00:59:11,836
I don't know what I'm doing.

757
00:59:11,915 --> 00:59:14,975
- What the fuck?
- Well, you're not...

758
00:59:17,120 --> 00:59:19,213
Is it supposed to be this cruel though?

759
00:59:19,289 --> 00:59:22,315
I mean, that's what it feels like.
That's-- that's what you want?

760
00:59:22,392 --> 00:59:24,587
What do you think, Anita?

761
00:59:24,661 --> 00:59:26,993
I mean it depends
on what you think is cruel.

762
00:59:27,063 --> 00:59:29,463
What do you think is cruel?
I'd be interested to know.

763
00:59:31,734 --> 00:59:33,895
I-- I just asked you.

764
00:59:33,970 --> 00:59:35,335
I asked you.
Raymond?

765
00:59:35,405 --> 00:59:37,100
I didn't ask Raymond.
I asked you.

766
00:59:38,575 --> 00:59:40,941
- Julie, do you understand?
- Martine, what are you doing?

767
00:59:46,616 --> 00:59:47,674
Yeah.

768
00:59:48,718 --> 00:59:50,743
Are you all right?

769
00:59:50,820 --> 00:59:52,788
Yeah, let me just think.

770
01:00:19,349 --> 01:00:22,045
He thinks that she's watching him

771
01:00:23,119 --> 01:00:24,609
when she's asleep.

772
01:00:24,687 --> 01:00:27,212
I know, but--

773
01:00:27,290 --> 01:00:30,521
Maybe she's awake.
Maybe she's not sleeping at all.

774
01:00:30,593 --> 01:00:33,653
Raymond?
Any thoughts, Raymond?

775
01:00:35,264 --> 01:00:37,789
Raymond, any--
any thoughts on that?

776
01:00:43,239 --> 01:00:45,207
Martine, I think you're being cruel.

777
01:00:47,210 --> 01:00:49,371
Maybe I am.

778
01:00:50,513 --> 01:00:51,980
I'm gonna take you home.

779
01:00:55,718 --> 01:00:58,243
Well, I'm sorry.

780
01:00:58,321 --> 01:01:02,849
Uh, I'm not feeling so well.
Raymond's gonna see me home.

781
01:01:02,925 --> 01:01:04,620
Sorry.

782
01:01:20,910 --> 01:01:22,775
You should have just told me.

783
01:01:32,822 --> 01:01:34,414
Anita.

784
01:01:35,458 --> 01:01:37,358
It's for you.

785
01:01:38,594 --> 01:01:40,653
Just lay off for a second, okay?

786
01:01:44,100 --> 01:01:45,692
She doesn't wanna talk.

787
01:01:45,768 --> 01:01:47,565
Yeah, she's confused.

788
01:01:49,138 --> 01:01:51,504
Yeah, she just fucked up rehearsal.

789
01:02:56,706 --> 01:02:59,834
One night
I saw a woman under a tree--

790
01:02:59,909 --> 01:03:01,536
a whispering ash.

791
01:03:01,611 --> 01:03:05,342
She was alone
but her skirt was raised.

792
01:03:24,600 --> 01:03:27,433
I could see that
she had been touched

793
01:03:27,503 --> 01:03:28,993
as I had been.

794
01:03:46,956 --> 01:03:50,585
I feel like there's something
you want to say to me, Martine.

795
01:03:50,660 --> 01:03:51,991
What?

796
01:03:53,062 --> 01:03:54,586
I don't know.

797
01:03:55,765 --> 01:03:58,131
If there's something
you wanna say, say it.

798
01:04:00,303 --> 01:04:03,898
I-- I think-- I think
we should talk later.

799
01:04:05,675 --> 01:04:07,905
Forgive me, Anita.

800
01:05:46,776 --> 01:05:48,368
Martine?

801
01:06:10,032 --> 01:06:11,829
Martine?

802
01:06:13,002 --> 01:06:14,230
Martine.

803
01:06:53,809 --> 01:06:56,141
This is probably a mistake.

804
01:06:57,713 --> 01:06:59,704
Well, you show things to Raymond

805
01:06:59,782 --> 01:07:01,773
before they're finished, right?

806
01:07:03,419 --> 01:07:05,387
Well...

807
01:07:07,790 --> 01:07:09,257
Can I get you something?

808
01:07:09,325 --> 01:07:11,259
No, I'm-I'm-- I'm good.

809
01:07:56,338 --> 01:07:58,568
Maybe I'll just read this first part.

810
01:08:00,943 --> 01:08:03,468
If you want.

811
01:08:09,318 --> 01:08:12,481
"She lay on the bed in the quiet room.

812
01:08:12,555 --> 01:08:14,682
Then something happened.

813
01:08:14,757 --> 01:08:17,453
She could hear footsteps
in the hallway

814
01:08:17,526 --> 01:08:18,993
coming closer.

815
01:08:19,061 --> 01:08:21,154
The door didn't open,

816
01:08:21,230 --> 01:08:23,721
but now the steps were in the room.

817
01:08:23,799 --> 01:08:27,360
They stopped
and she could hear breathing.

818
01:08:27,436 --> 01:08:29,631
And now she could see.

819
01:08:29,705 --> 01:08:32,265
In the mirror in the corner behind her

820
01:08:32,341 --> 01:08:34,502
at the edge of the bed,

821
01:08:34,577 --> 01:08:36,977
a man watching her,

822
01:08:37,046 --> 01:08:40,015
his shadow touching her skin.

823
01:08:40,082 --> 01:08:43,074
She closed her eyes
and she could feel nothing

824
01:08:43,152 --> 01:08:45,086
but the shadow of the man

825
01:08:45,154 --> 01:08:47,054
touching her."

826
01:08:48,757 --> 01:08:50,384
Who is this man?

827
01:08:59,802 --> 01:09:01,429
What are you scared of?

828
01:09:02,738 --> 01:09:04,797
I didn't say I was scared of anything.

829
01:09:05,941 --> 01:09:08,432
Maybe you like
his shadow touching you.

830
01:09:12,214 --> 01:09:14,409
I don't know what I like.

831
01:09:45,414 --> 01:09:46,938
Hello.

832
01:09:48,684 --> 01:09:50,208
Oh hi, Raymond.

833
01:09:54,490 --> 01:09:56,822
Yeah, hold on one second.

834
01:10:00,429 --> 01:10:02,989
Hello? Hi.

835
01:10:05,034 --> 01:10:08,265
Um, okay.
Yeah, we're just finishing up.

836
01:10:10,472 --> 01:10:13,100
Yeah, I'll see you in a few minutes.

837
01:10:17,413 --> 01:10:18,539
So...

838
01:11:27,650 --> 01:11:30,551
Tyrone called after you left.

839
01:11:32,788 --> 01:11:34,881
He's worried about you.

840
01:11:41,530 --> 01:11:43,896
He said that?

841
01:11:46,635 --> 01:11:48,603
I don't trust him, not at all.

842
01:11:48,671 --> 01:11:50,639
But yeah, that's what he said.

843
01:12:16,565 --> 01:12:19,659
Um, I'm sorry that, you know,

844
01:12:19,735 --> 01:12:22,329
this has been so scattered

845
01:12:22,404 --> 01:12:24,031
and all the changes.

846
01:12:25,507 --> 01:12:26,838
Is that what you think?

847
01:12:27,943 --> 01:12:29,570
No.

848
01:12:45,861 --> 01:12:48,227
- What's this?
- It's for later.

849
01:12:49,431 --> 01:12:50,398
Okay.

850
01:12:52,034 --> 01:12:55,094
Um, Raymond told me

851
01:12:55,170 --> 01:12:57,832
that you were having some problems

852
01:12:57,906 --> 01:13:00,534
with-- with the work.

853
01:13:01,777 --> 01:13:04,041
Well, I don't know
why he would say that.

854
01:13:12,621 --> 01:13:14,111
- Julie.
- Mmm?

855
01:13:14,189 --> 01:13:16,555
- You ready?
- Yeah, I guess.

856
01:13:16,625 --> 01:13:20,117
- Okay.
- Uh...

857
01:13:21,697 --> 01:13:23,562
All right.

858
01:14:42,444 --> 01:14:43,843
Hello? Oh, hi.

859
01:14:43,912 --> 01:14:45,709
No, she just left.

860
01:14:45,781 --> 01:14:48,011
She said she wasn't feeling well.

861
01:14:48,083 --> 01:14:50,074
She mentioned you--
about the new piece.

862
01:14:50,152 --> 01:14:51,642
Yeah, and...

863
01:14:54,823 --> 01:14:56,154
Hey, leave her alone.

864
01:14:57,526 --> 01:14:59,187
- No no no!
- Oh my God!

865
01:14:59,261 --> 01:15:02,424
Just stop it! No no, don't!

866
01:16:13,101 --> 01:16:14,966
Can I just sit down?

867
01:16:17,139 --> 01:16:18,902
Hello.

868
01:16:18,974 --> 01:16:21,272
You want help?

869
01:16:21,343 --> 01:16:23,675
No. Um...

870
01:16:23,745 --> 01:16:25,804
this is nice.

871
01:16:25,881 --> 01:16:28,907
Please just stay with me.

872
01:16:34,756 --> 01:16:36,781
You're-- you're so pretty.

873
01:16:36,858 --> 01:16:38,655
You're so pretty.

874
01:16:40,295 --> 01:16:41,956
Let's just stay here.

875
01:16:42,030 --> 01:16:44,897
- Let's just be alone.
- No, lady. Please.

876
01:16:44,967 --> 01:16:47,458
Let's-- no no no no no no.

877
01:16:47,536 --> 01:16:49,868
It's okay. It's okay.

878
01:16:49,938 --> 01:16:51,838
- Please.
- No.

879
01:16:59,047 --> 01:17:00,537
Who are you?

880
01:17:03,452 --> 01:17:05,818
- Please, lady. Please, lady.
- Who are you?!

881
01:17:05,887 --> 01:17:07,946
- Don't scream.
- What did you do?!

882
01:17:08,023 --> 01:17:09,820
What did you do to me?!
Oh my God!

883
01:17:09,891 --> 01:17:11,859
What's going on?

884
01:17:11,927 --> 01:17:14,293
Oh my God!
What did you do to me?! Oh my God!

885
01:17:14,363 --> 01:17:16,456
- Just stay back.
- What did you do to me?!

886
01:17:17,766 --> 01:17:19,427
What did you do to me?!

887
01:17:21,770 --> 01:17:24,933
Oh no!
Oh no, no no no no!

888
01:17:25,007 --> 01:17:26,565
- Oh no!
- What's going on here?

889
01:17:26,642 --> 01:17:29,475
- No no no no.
- What did you do?

890
01:17:29,544 --> 01:17:31,978
- Ma'am, you just need to stay back.
- No!

891
01:17:32,047 --> 01:17:33,947
- Did he touch you? Are you okay?
- No no no.

892
01:17:34,016 --> 01:17:36,041
- No no no!
- Try to calm down.

893
01:17:36,118 --> 01:17:37,517
She won't tell me what's going on.

894
01:17:38,587 --> 01:17:40,179
- No no!
- What's going--

895
01:17:40,255 --> 01:17:42,723
- just-- just step back, ma'am.
- Let's go. No.

896
01:18:21,797 --> 01:18:23,662
Her parents died
when she was really young.

897
01:18:23,732 --> 01:18:25,597
They died in a car crash.

898
01:18:26,835 --> 01:18:29,133
She's kind of secretive
in a way, I guess.

899
01:18:29,204 --> 01:18:31,229
I don't know. I--

900
01:18:34,309 --> 01:18:36,436
What happened to her?

901
01:18:44,820 --> 01:18:47,721
"Write a letter to the dead.

902
01:18:47,789 --> 01:18:50,155
Write it for the dead to read.

903
01:18:52,260 --> 01:18:55,491
Oh the dead have swum too far.

904
01:18:55,564 --> 01:18:58,897
They have swum beyond the sea.

905
01:19:01,036 --> 01:19:03,869
Take the letter in your hand

906
01:19:03,939 --> 01:19:06,999
Make a fold, and make a fold.

907
01:19:12,013 --> 01:19:14,538
Make it into a little boat

908
01:19:14,616 --> 01:19:17,414
And place a candle in the hold.

909
01:19:30,799 --> 01:19:33,791
Let the paper boat float on

910
01:19:33,869 --> 01:19:36,030
Where the river meets the sea.

911
01:19:36,104 --> 01:19:38,504
That is where my heart belongs.

912
01:19:38,573 --> 01:19:41,201
That is where I long to be.

913
01:19:41,276 --> 01:19:43,938
Every candle is a star.

914
01:19:44,012 --> 01:19:46,810
Every boat floats out to sea--

915
01:19:46,882 --> 01:19:49,680
Which I think is not too far

916
01:19:49,751 --> 01:19:52,413
And that is where I long to be.

917
01:19:52,487 --> 01:19:54,853
And that is where I long to be."

918
01:20:06,868 --> 01:20:08,768
One day

919
01:20:08,837 --> 01:20:10,737
I noticed that

920
01:20:10,806 --> 01:20:13,400
something was staring at me.

921
01:20:17,145 --> 01:20:18,874
What was?

922
01:20:33,795 --> 01:20:36,628
Is it possible
you just imagined--

923
01:20:36,698 --> 01:20:38,495
Anything's possible.

924
01:20:52,447 --> 01:20:54,847
Martine, do you think people
are out to get you?

925
01:21:07,028 --> 01:21:09,121
I suppose I used to,

926
01:21:10,232 --> 01:21:11,790
but, um...

927
01:21:42,831 --> 01:21:46,824
I'm writing a story.

928
01:21:48,136 --> 01:21:50,832
I wonder if you wanna hear it.

929
01:21:59,347 --> 01:22:03,716
"Once there was this girl,

930
01:22:06,054 --> 01:22:08,488
and she was very beautiful.

931
01:22:09,658 --> 01:22:11,626
Not unlike you.

932
01:22:14,996 --> 01:22:16,759
And one day

933
01:22:16,831 --> 01:22:18,890
she woke up

934
01:22:18,967 --> 01:22:20,594
and she realized

935
01:22:20,669 --> 01:22:23,763
she had made a dreadful mistake."

936
01:22:27,142 --> 01:22:29,076
That's it.

937
01:22:29,144 --> 01:22:30,907
That's my story.

938
01:22:31,980 --> 01:22:33,777
I wonder if you liked it.

939
01:22:33,848 --> 01:22:36,316
Uh, no no, l, uh--

940
01:22:36,384 --> 01:22:38,784
I didn't like it very much.

941
01:22:40,655 --> 01:22:42,850
Well, I'm sorry
you didn't like my story.

942
01:22:43,925 --> 01:22:45,756
Maybe I'll work on it

943
01:22:45,827 --> 01:22:47,727
a little more.

944
01:22:55,637 --> 01:22:58,333
Goodbye, Martine.

945
01:22:58,406 --> 01:23:00,704
Thank you for the flowers.

946
01:23:00,775 --> 01:23:02,970
They're beautiful.

947
01:23:08,016 --> 01:23:09,506
I love you.

948
01:23:20,462 --> 01:23:22,293
Be careful.

949
01:23:30,505 --> 01:23:32,564
We're pretty sure she was exposed,

950
01:23:32,640 --> 01:23:35,006
though I can't really say how,

951
01:23:35,076 --> 01:23:37,067
to a catalyzed form of a leaf

952
01:23:37,145 --> 01:23:39,079
of a tree found in Colombia.

953
01:23:39,147 --> 01:23:41,240
It's called scopolamine.

954
01:23:41,316 --> 01:23:43,944
The criminals use it
to break down the will

955
01:23:44,019 --> 01:23:46,487
or the rational thoughts
of their victims.

956
01:23:46,554 --> 01:23:49,648
They blow the powder
into their victim's face

957
01:23:49,724 --> 01:23:52,090
Iike this, and the victim--

958
01:23:52,160 --> 01:23:54,424
it's odorless, it's colorless.

959
01:23:56,631 --> 01:23:59,532
How strange.

960
01:23:59,601 --> 01:24:02,263
And while it's used medicinally

961
01:24:02,337 --> 01:24:05,135
in very minute amounts
for a variety of conditions,

962
01:24:05,206 --> 01:24:06,867
when it's combined with morphine,

963
01:24:06,941 --> 01:24:09,671
it produces a state
called "twilight sleep."

964
01:24:09,744 --> 01:24:13,441
It's also known
as a kind of truth serum.

965
01:24:13,515 --> 01:24:15,642
It crosses the blood-brain barrier

966
01:24:15,717 --> 01:24:17,548
and affects the central nervous system.

967
01:24:17,619 --> 01:24:19,678
It's my guess that Martine's exposure

968
01:24:19,754 --> 01:24:22,086
was at very small levels

969
01:24:22,157 --> 01:24:23,886
but over a prolonged period.

970
01:24:23,958 --> 01:24:27,359
"How" doesn't really matter, I suppose.

971
01:24:27,429 --> 01:24:31,490
Unfortunately, the effect
of long-term exposure was--

972
01:24:31,566 --> 01:24:34,467
well, there are obvious
neurological problems...

973
01:25:07,936 --> 01:25:10,598
I worked more on my story,

974
01:25:10,672 --> 01:25:12,640
the one that you read to me.

975
01:25:13,708 --> 01:25:15,505
Here it is.

976
01:25:23,751 --> 01:25:26,879
"l had begun walking
when it was still dark.

977
01:25:26,955 --> 01:25:30,322
Now at midday,
when I was alone,

978
01:25:30,391 --> 01:25:32,416
I sat under a tree--

979
01:25:32,494 --> 01:25:34,826
a whispering ash.

980
01:26:13,368 --> 01:26:16,565
And I felt a hand on my thigh.

981
01:26:20,275 --> 01:26:22,903
A man was there, lying next to me,

982
01:26:22,977 --> 01:26:25,172
touching my leg inside,

983
01:26:25,246 --> 01:26:28,215
high above my knee under my skirt.

984
01:26:28,283 --> 01:26:31,275
His hand moved higher, slowly.

985
01:26:48,303 --> 01:26:50,032
I couldn't look at him,

986
01:26:50,104 --> 01:26:52,197
but I felt his eyes on me.

987
01:26:53,308 --> 01:26:55,208
And so I slept.

988
01:27:35,550 --> 01:27:39,452
As I slept,
I dreamt that I wrote you this letter

989
01:27:39,520 --> 01:27:42,114
and I put it in the sea."

990
01:28:55,997 --> 01:28:57,396
Have a seat.

991
01:28:58,933 --> 01:29:01,424
"And I heard now for the first time

992
01:29:01,502 --> 01:29:04,562
the silver breath of wind
in the ash tree

993
01:29:05,773 --> 01:29:07,331
whispering above me

994
01:29:07,408 --> 01:29:09,968
as I saw the shadows
of the slender leaves

995
01:29:10,044 --> 01:29:12,672
tremble against the skin on my leg,

996
01:29:12,747 --> 01:29:15,511
high up where the skirt was raised

997
01:29:15,583 --> 01:29:17,414
above the knee.

998
01:29:17,485 --> 01:29:19,350
The shadows of the leaves

999
01:29:19,420 --> 01:29:23,117
felt sweet on my skin

1000
01:29:23,191 --> 01:29:25,955
and I watched their soft movements,

1001
01:29:26,027 --> 01:29:28,222
touching me.

1002
01:29:32,066 --> 01:29:35,001
I felt the shadows across my skin

1003
01:29:35,069 --> 01:29:36,536
and I watched.

1004
01:29:40,241 --> 01:29:42,300
Love, Martine."
