was no longer decomposing

536

any signature of the body.

that was above the body

a loose sort of fill,

Just going to be honest.

705
00:35:24,264 --> 00:35:26,561
He was taken here.
I think he was hung here.

he stole something.

what his message is right now

speaking with you,

is to know he's not
going to disrespect you.

00:35:44,449 --> 00:35:47,615
It's-- he wants people to
understand he was a good man.

But I think the reason
he is really strong here

714

is because
this is where he passed.

1047
00:51:22,650 --> 00:51:25,321
One, if we found something,
we could offer proper burial.

1048
00:51:25,356 --> 00:51:28,687
We could do things
that could possibly get Alice

1049

to feel better in terms of
the phenomena happening here.

1050
00:51:31,560 --> 00:51:33,890
And maybe show Alice
that it is something

1051
00:51:33,925 --> 00:51:36,695
that is human in nature,
that it could have been

1052

a person that was once alive.

1053
00:51:38,303 --> 00:51:40,501

00:58:20,936 --> 00:58:23,167
as I say,
singing from the same hymnal.

1214
00:58:23,202 --> 00:58:24,707
You know,
we get all these devices

1215
00:58:24,742 --> 00:58:26,203
and what do we do
to make new ones?

1216
00:58:26,238 --> 00:58:28,040
We just put
a new light on it.

1217
00:58:28,075 --> 00:58:30,911
You see some lights go off,
you hear an alarm go off.

1218
00:58:30,946 --> 00:58:34,277
And you're like, "Ooh, ah,"
like, "There's something here."

1219
00:58:34,312 --> 00:58:35,883
But that's not the case.

1220
00:58:35,918 --> 00:58:37,247
You know, like,
there's so many other factors

1221
00:58:37,282 --> 00:58:39,051
to take
into consideration.

1222
00:58:39,086 --> 00:58:40,316
Or we combined, you know--

1223
00:58:40,351 --> 00:58:41,790
"Now it has
two features in one."

1224
00:58:41,825 --> 00:58:43,088
It's like,
but it's really nothing new.

1225
00:58:43,123 --> 00:58:44,595
It's the same thing.

1226
00:58:44,630 --> 00:58:46,091
And I think that...

1227
00:58:47,292 --> 00:58:48,797
there has to be expansion

1228
00:58:48,832 --> 00:58:51,129
outside of the community
to kind of understand

1229
00:58:51,164 --> 00:58:52,834
the tools that they're using.

1230
00:58:53,166 --> 00:58:55,133
And to also understand

1231
00:58:55,168 --> 00:58:56,640
all the false positives

1232
00:58:56,675 --> 00:58:58,268
that they are getting
in the process.

1233
00:58:58,809 --> 00:59:00,809
Coming to the house,
I did want to create

1234
00:59:00,844 --> 00:59:03,647
and-- and kind of customize
things that made sense

1235
00:59:03,682 --> 00:59:05,913
to what you guys
experience here, you know?

1236
00:59:05,948 --> 00:59:07,981
And everything
that you documented before.

1237
00:59:08,720 --> 00:59:10,687
And, you know, I--

1238
00:59:10,722 --> 00:59:13,382
I like to
sometimes do things

1239
00:59:13,417 --> 00:59:15,791
that other people
wouldn't necessarily do

1240
00:59:15,826 --> 00:59:17,254
just because
if we don't try it,

1241
00:59:17,289 --> 00:59:18,860
we won't know
what's going to work.

1242
00:59:19,357 --> 00:59:21,357
I have great respect
for Elizabeth Saint,

1243
00:59:21,392 --> 00:59:22,897
having known her
over the years,

1244
00:59:22,932 --> 00:59:24,393
having traveled from,
you know,

1245
00:59:24,428 --> 00:59:26,098
conventions
and things together

1246
00:59:26,133 --> 00:59:28,298
and knowing that Elizabeth
goes out of her way

1247
00:59:28,333 --> 00:59:30,036
to make specific equipment

1248
00:59:30,071 --> 00:59:32,203
like the light anomaly
that's here.

1249
00:59:32,238 --> 00:59:35,976
This is the-- the light sensor
I told you about.

1250
00:59:36,011 --> 00:59:38,814
So maybe if we do see
any light anomalies,

1251
00:59:38,849 --> 00:59:40,882
we might be able to--
It'll let us know

1252
00:59:40,917 --> 00:59:43,753
by the color
that it shines, essentially.

1253
00:59:43,788 --> 00:59:45,854
She developed something
to look for those lights

1254
00:59:45,889 --> 00:59:47,856
and then to try to figure out
which color lights it is.

1255
00:59:47,891 --> 00:59:49,726
And it lights up responsively.

1256
00:59:49,761 --> 00:59:50,892
And the most famous thing,

1257
00:59:50,927 --> 00:59:52,256
the ball moving
down the stairs.

1258
00:59:52,291 --> 00:59:54,225
So she makes
a ball that she can

1259
00:59:54,260 --> 00:59:55,831
measure any slight movement.

1260
00:59:55,866 --> 00:59:58,196
So, what's
unique about this is, um,

1261
00:59:58,231 --> 00:59:59,362
I call it
the comm sphere.

1262
00:59:59,936 --> 01:00:02,838
And it actually
communicates with my phone.

1263
01:00:02,873 --> 01:00:06,237
The Y x or Z axis and it
goes right to her software.

1264
01:00:06,272 --> 01:00:07,304
And it sends her an alert.

1265
01:00:07,339 --> 01:00:09,075
So it'll show me values

1266
01:00:09,110 --> 01:00:12,782
in the X, Y, Z direction,
if it moves.

1267
01:00:12,817 --> 01:00:15,884
To have the passion to say,

1268
01:00:15,919 --> 01:00:17,380
"I'm doing this case.

1269
01:00:17,415 --> 01:00:19,085
What's the type of activity?

1270
01:00:19,120 --> 01:00:21,054
What can I make
specifically that will speak

1271
01:00:21,089 --> 01:00:24,024
to trying to measure
that type of activity?"

1272
01:00:24,059 --> 01:00:25,762
I mean, that's--
I have trouble

1273
01:00:25,797 --> 01:00:27,324
getting on the Wi-Fi sometimes.

1274
01:00:27,359 --> 01:00:29,062
She's like,
light years above that.

1275
01:00:29,097 --> 01:00:32,032
So, I've known Dustin Perry
for a few years now.

1276
01:00:32,067 --> 01:00:34,771
And we've
always seen each other like,

1277
01:00:34,806 --> 01:00:36,267
on the road or,
you know,

1278
01:00:36,302 --> 01:00:37,939
the--
the paranormal community

1279
01:00:37,974 --> 01:00:39,743
is very, like,
tight knit community,

1280
01:00:39,778 --> 01:00:40,975
so we've always
run into each other.

1281
01:00:41,010 --> 01:00:42,911
But I've never
had the opportunity

1282
01:00:42,946 --> 01:00:45,441
to actually work with him,
so I'm really excited

1283
01:00:45,476 --> 01:00:47,245
that I'll be
able to do that here.

1284
01:00:47,280 --> 01:00:48,917
[Dustin] Um, Alice.

1285
01:00:48,952 --> 01:00:50,380
She seems to really
embrace what's going on here,

1286
01:00:50,415 --> 01:00:53,119
which is odd because she also
seems to be afraid of it.

1287
01:00:53,154 --> 01:00:55,858
And all I want to do
is go upstairs and to the left.

1288
01:00:55,893 --> 01:00:57,156
Ever since
I've walked in the house.

1289
01:00:57,191 --> 01:00:58,388
-Really?
-[Dustin] Yeah.

1290
01:00:58,423 --> 01:00:59,422
When I first
walked into the house,

1291
01:00:59,457 --> 01:01:00,489
I even told her that.

1292
01:01:00,524 --> 01:01:01,963
When I first walked in,

1293
01:01:01,998 --> 01:01:04,328
I was immediately
drawn to that door frame.

1294
01:01:04,363 --> 01:01:05,802
Yeah, yeah, for sure.

1295
01:01:05,837 --> 01:01:07,232
Just based on
years of experience

1296
01:01:07,267 --> 01:01:08,398
and feeling
drawn to places

1297
01:01:08,433 --> 01:01:10,103

to be the place.

-[Dustin] So.

because we have

the three mirrors
like you said here.

And then,
there's another right there.

1305

for light purposes too

But there's no road there.

not getting any, like,

coming in through there?

1313

[Elizabeth] No.

1314
01:01:39,564 --> 01:01:41,937
Because I was just trying
to think for bouncing light.

1315
01:01:41,972 --> 01:01:44,104
We are close
to the road in the front.

1316
01:01:47,010 --> 01:01:48,207
[Dustin] Watch that wire.

1317
01:01:51,575 --> 01:01:53,278
[Elizabeth] It's just
a-- a walk-in?

1318

What's with all the mirrors?

1319
01:01:58,021 --> 01:01:59,416
There's one on the floor.

1320
01:02:00,155 --> 01:02:03,123
I don't know.
There is a crawlspace.

Stay right there.

Do you know
if anyone's ever been?

No one's gone
in the crawlspace?

1325
01:02:16,468 --> 01:02:18,204
We have to go
in the crawlspace.

1326
01:02:18,239 --> 01:02:20,173
[Dustin] Yeah, we definitely
have to go in the crawlspace.

[Dustin] All my hair's
just standing up there.

something, like, grazed me

looked down and everything...

feels like more is going.
