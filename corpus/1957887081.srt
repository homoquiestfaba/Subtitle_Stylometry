- Go ahead, sit down.
- Oh.

522
00:25:56,291 --> 00:25:57,291
Okay.

523
00:25:59,416 --> 00:26:01,083
Oh! [sighs]

524
00:26:01,583 --> 00:26:05,083
Things just have not been the same
since I lost her.

525
00:26:06,833 --> 00:26:07,833
My mom.

526
00:26:08,958 --> 00:26:11,041
She would have loved it here.

527
00:26:11,125 --> 00:26:13,833
Oh, with all the lights and the snow...

528
00:26:15,041 --> 00:26:16,958
She loved Christmas so much.

529
00:26:18,583 --> 00:26:20,791
It's crazy, you know, I'll catch myself.

530
00:26:21,833 --> 00:26:24,458
I'll get really excited
to tell her about my day,

531
00:26:24,958 --> 00:26:28,000
and then I'll remember that she's gone.

532
00:26:33,291 --> 00:26:35,041
I know that exact feeling.

533
00:26:37,583 --> 00:26:41,083
There's so much I wanna share with her.

534
00:26:43,125 --> 00:26:45,708
Like my quince, for example.

535
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:50,500
It's supposed to be this big moment

536
00:26:51,166 --> 00:26:53,083
on my way to becoming a woman.

537
00:26:55,250 --> 00:26:56,833
And it feels strange.

538
00:26:58,583 --> 00:26:59,583
Just

539
00:27:00,875 --> 00:27:02,791
not to have her there to see it.

540
00:27:10,958 --> 00:27:13,416
Well, I'm sure
she would have been very proud of you.

541
00:27:14,041 --> 00:27:16,416
And lucky for you, you've got your dad.

542
00:27:17,333 --> 00:27:18,958
Yeah, he's...

543
00:27:20,541 --> 00:27:21,958

I'm sure it's delicious,

uh, stick with some beans.

- Huh?
- I have to fit in my dress for this thing.

You're just gonna eat beans?

592
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:13,583
Yeah, I mean, it's protein.

Don't get me started.

594
00:29:15,291 --> 00:29:17,833
It's a necessary evil of showbiz.

That's why you're so skinny.

Oh, these are all his instruments,
and he composes too.

we can write a great song.

695
00:33:53,666 --> 00:33:56,833
- Yeah, I just don't...
- Okay, I'm gonna level with you right now.

696
00:33:58,583 --> 00:33:59,583
I need this.

697
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,583
I need a brand-new song, Miguel.

698
00:34:05,333 --> 00:34:07,041
I need a brand-new Christmas song.

699
00:34:07,125 --> 00:34:09,166
Okay, there. It's... It's out there.

700
00:34:09,250 --> 00:34:13,416
I owe my label a new track,
and I've been coming up completely blank.

701
00:34:14,166 --> 00:34:17,000
And I really feel that this could be it.

702
00:34:17,083 --> 00:34:19,791
I mean, you saw how seamlessly
we played it together inside.

703
00:34:19,875 --> 00:34:22,541
- I think that we could do this.
- Okay? Say we do this.

704
00:34:22,625 --> 00:34:24,166
How... how does it even work?

705
00:34:25,166 --> 00:34:26,041
Easy.

706
00:34:26,125 --> 00:34:28,291
We agree up front
that it's a mutual split,

707
00:34:28,375 --> 00:34:32,250
strictly business deal,
<i>and </i>I get my single.

708
00:34:32,333 --> 00:34:36,833
You, nice chunk of change that you can put
towards Cristina's college

709
00:34:36,916 --> 00:34:38,291
as well as

710
00:34:39,375 --> 00:34:41,916
royalties if the song is a hit.

711
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,166
It would be kind of nice.

712
00:34:44,250 --> 00:34:47,166
Oh, also, you can finally get the band out
of the garage.

713
00:34:47,250 --> 00:34:48,666
[playful music playing]

714
00:34:54,166 --> 00:34:56,333
[hesitates] I don't even know what to say.

715
00:34:56,416 --> 00:34:58,583
Just say yes.

716
00:34:58,666 --> 00:34:59,666
[whispering] Yes.

717
00:35:00,083 --> 00:35:01,291
- So easy.
- [scoffs]

718
00:35:01,875 --> 00:35:03,875
So, deal?

719
00:35:05,333 --> 00:35:06,625
[sighs] Deal.

720
00:35:11,375 --> 00:35:14,500
[Frida] Miguel, Miguel.
<i>Vente, vente. Vente, vente.</i>

721
00:35:14,583 --> 00:35:16,166
<i>¡Okey, ya, vete!</i>

722
00:35:16,250 --> 00:35:19,208
Give me a chance
to get to know our guests.

723
00:35:19,291 --> 00:35:21,125
<i>Dile</i>, Cristina!

724
00:35:21,208 --> 00:35:23,666
We women need some space to chitchat.

725
00:35:23,750 --> 00:35:25,851
[Miguel] All right, don't worry.
You're gonna be okay.

726
00:35:25,875 --> 00:35:28,541
- Just... don't let her drink after midnight.
- [Angelina laughs]

727
00:35:28,625 --> 00:35:32,000
- Dad! Seriously? Why would you say that?
- [Angelina] I made a deal.

728
00:35:36,333 --> 00:35:37,500
Who wants a shot?

729
00:35:37,583 --> 00:35:40,291
["We Wish You a Merry Christmas"
instrumental playing]

730
00:35:45,250 --> 00:35:46,500
[music ends]

731
00:35:50,041 --> 00:35:51,375
[sighs]

732
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:55,041
He's kind of cute, you know.

733
00:35:55,125 --> 00:35:57,708
Mo, don't even start with that.

734
00:35:57,791 --> 00:36:01,625
I am here for the song and only the song.

735
00:36:02,166 --> 00:36:03,833
I just hope the song is good enough.

736
00:36:09,958 --> 00:36:12,666
["The Twelve Days of Christmas"
instrumental playing]

737
00:36:16,708 --> 00:36:19,125
Miguel? Oh. Oh jeez.

738
00:36:21,541 --> 00:36:22,541
[Miguel sighs]

739
00:36:22,583 --> 00:36:24,625
[Angelina groans]

740
00:36:25,250 --> 00:36:27,458
[Miguel] Oh no.

741
00:36:27,958 --> 00:36:29,375
- Oh yes.
- [Miguel scoffs]

742
00:36:30,083 --> 00:36:31,083
What?

743
00:36:31,625 --> 00:36:33,708
Grandma broke out the Christmas tequila.

744
00:36:33,791 --> 00:36:35,833
<i>Ay, Dios mío. </i>[chuckles]

745
00:36:35,916 --> 00:36:38,250
She is a hoot, that lady.

746
00:36:38,333 --> 00:36:39,416
Here. Take this.

747
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:40,666
I haven't touched it yet,

748
00:36:40,750 --> 00:36:42,750
and you're gonna need that
way more than I do.

749
00:36:42,833 --> 00:36:43,833
Thank you.

750
00:36:44,916 --> 00:36:46,791
[softly slurps, swallows]

751
00:36:47,375 --> 00:36:49,875
Ah, that is so good.

752
00:36:51,041 --> 00:36:52,958
I hope it helps. And I'm so sorry.

753
00:36:53,041 --> 00:36:54,250
Oh, don't be sorry.

754
00:36:54,333 --> 00:36:57,291
- It... It was actually kind of fun.
- [Miguel chuckles]

755
00:36:58,666 --> 00:36:59,958
Where are you guys off to?

756
00:37:00,041 --> 00:37:02,833
- Oh, we're headed to my quince rehearsal.
- Oh, cool.

757
00:37:02,916 --> 00:37:06,375
Uh, hey, so I wanted to tell you.
I worked on the song some more last night.

758
00:37:06,458 --> 00:37:08,708
- Really? Me too. What'd you do?
- What'd you do?

759
00:37:08,791 --> 00:37:11,291
Oh, I can play it for you real quick
if you want...

760
00:37:11,375 --> 00:37:12,583
- It's the...
- I... Well, no.

761
00:37:12,666 --> 00:37:14,916
We... We will be back in a bit,

762
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,500
but you are more than welcome

763
00:37:16,583 --> 00:37:19,500
to go inside, stay warm,
use the piano, and we'll be right back.

764
00:37:19,583 --> 00:37:22,000
Or we could go back to the city.

765
00:37:22,666 --> 00:37:24,416
[Miguel] Sure. Yeah. Yeah.

766
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:30,083
I mean, you probably have to go...
anywhere... celebrities go.

767
00:37:30,166 --> 00:37:33,250
Miguel, I need the song ASAP.

768
00:37:33,333 --> 00:37:37,791
I can't just stay here when we're both
clearly vibing on song.

769
00:37:37,875 --> 00:37:41,666
I mean, we're... We're... What if we miss
a crucial moment of inspiration? I...

770
00:37:42,333 --> 00:37:43,791
We're flowing. I can't...

771
00:37:44,291 --> 00:37:45,416
Uh... [sighs]

772
00:37:47,458 --> 00:37:50,708
Okay. Yeah, you know what?
I'll just come with you.

773
00:37:50,791 --> 00:37:53,416
Yeah. I'll just come with you,
and we can work at the rehearsal.

774
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:55,833
What? You... you wanna come?

775
00:37:55,916 --> 00:37:58,556
I mean, unless you don't want me to.
I... I don't want to overstep.

776
00:37:58,583 --> 00:37:59,500
Well, no, no, no.

777
00:37:59,583 --> 00:38:01,625
Of course, I'd...
Of course, we want you to.

778
00:38:01,708 --> 00:38:03,028
I mean, you're more than welcome.

779
00:38:03,083 --> 00:38:04,208
It's just,

780
00:38:05,458 --> 00:38:08,541
you're probably used to
events of a certain

781
00:38:09,666 --> 00:38:12,375
caliber and style,

782
00:38:12,458 --> 00:38:14,250
and we're a little more...

783
00:38:14,333 --> 00:38:17,291
Miguel, I'm a recording artist.

784
00:38:17,375 --> 00:38:18,750
I'm not a space alien.

785
00:38:20,208 --> 00:38:22,750
But, you know,
let me just clean up a little bit.

786
00:38:23,250 --> 00:38:26,083
So, we're going to a quince rehearsal now?

787
00:38:26,166 --> 00:38:27,458
[Angelina] Quince time.

788
00:38:27,541 --> 00:38:30,125
Oh my gosh! I'm freaking out!

789
00:38:30,208 --> 00:38:31,708
Speaking of freaking out,

790
00:38:31,791 --> 00:38:34,041
I have no idea how your <i>tías</i>
are gonna react to this.

791
00:38:34,125 --> 00:38:35,708
[both <i>tías </i>screaming]

792
00:38:35,791 --> 00:38:38,375
[both speaking excitedly and indistinctly]

793
00:38:39,125 --> 00:38:40,750
I said don't freak out.

794
00:38:41,333 --> 00:38:43,041
Clearly it runs in the family.

795
00:38:43,125 --> 00:38:44,500
It's her mother's side.

796
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:49,750
[both speaking excitedly, laughing]

797
00:38:49,833 --> 00:38:51,416
This is Connie and Conchi.

798
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:54,500
Cristina's <i>tías. </i>And they're
helping Cristina with her quince.

799
00:38:54,583 --> 00:38:56,291
- Hello.
- I love you.

800
00:38:56,375 --> 00:38:57,375
Oh!

801
00:38:58,541 --> 00:39:00,041
- Thank you.
- I love you more!

802
00:39:00,125 --> 00:39:01,166
Oh.

803
00:39:01,250 --> 00:39:03,250
Is this because of the video you did?

804
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,541
[kids laughing]

805
00:39:08,083 --> 00:39:10,708
I know! You should do
a video for Beyoncé next.

806
00:39:10,791 --> 00:39:12,083
I actually know Beyoncé.

807
00:39:12,166 --> 00:39:14,166
[all] You do?!

808
00:39:14,666 --> 00:39:16,500
[Cristina] Okay, guys,
let's stretch it out.

809
00:39:16,583 --> 00:39:17,666
[Conchi speaking Spanish]

810
00:39:18,875 --> 00:39:21,958
Okay, so can I show you some
of the lyrics I thought of last night?

811
00:39:22,458 --> 00:39:23,291
Wow!

812
00:39:23,375 --> 00:39:25,291
Okay. So... Ah, here we go.

813
00:39:25,375 --> 00:39:26,583
What do you think about this?

814
00:39:26,666 --> 00:39:28,958
I don't want Christmas
just to be another day.

815
00:39:29,958 --> 00:39:31,625
Is that good? Is that too much?

816
00:39:31,708 --> 00:39:33,625
No, no, no, no, no. I love it.

817
00:39:35,125 --> 00:39:37,333
Wh... what... what about this? May I?

818
00:39:37,416 --> 00:39:38,625
Oh yeah. Of course.

819
00:39:40,208 --> 00:39:41,208
[Conchi] Come on.

820
00:39:43,416 --> 00:39:44,500
[Conchi] Come on. Come on.

821
00:39:44,583 --> 00:39:47,000
'Cause there can be
no Christmas without you.

822
00:39:48,541 --> 00:39:49,583
Yes!

823
00:39:50,250 --> 00:39:53,958
- Yes! That is it! That's perfect.
- [Conchi] Take it from the top.

824
00:39:54,041 --> 00:39:56,583
- ["Luna Rumbera" playing]
- Five, six, seven, eight.

825
00:39:56,666 --> 00:40:01,166
One, two, three,
four, five, six, seven, eight.

826
00:40:01,250 --> 00:40:03,500
And one, two, three, four...

827
00:40:03,583 --> 00:40:06,000
This... this is crazy.

828
00:40:06,083 --> 00:40:08,583
I must have listened
to your <i>Love It or Leave It</i> album

829
00:40:08,666 --> 00:40:12,750
a thousand times in the car,
the break room, at the gym. [chuckles]

830
00:40:13,375 --> 00:40:15,041
Wait, <i>Love It or Leave It</i>?

831
00:40:15,750 --> 00:40:17,583
That album was, like, forever ago.

832
00:40:18,125 --> 00:40:19,333
What about <i>Slingshot</i>?

833
00:40:19,416 --> 00:40:22,208
That one was a little... [hesitates]

834
00:40:22,708 --> 00:40:25,250
[splutters] ...dancy for... for my taste.

835
00:40:25,333 --> 00:40:26,333
Dancy?

836
00:40:28,583 --> 00:40:31,458
- Huh.
- Oh, but that first album? [scoffs]

837
00:40:31,541 --> 00:40:32,916
Oh yeah.

838
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:36,666
- [exhales deeply]
- That... That one was... That one was magic.

839
00:40:36,750 --> 00:40:39,916
And now I'm sitting here
with the person who made it.

840
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,458
[Miguel chuckling]

841
00:40:41,541 --> 00:40:42,916
I'm just like anybody else.

842
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,000
No.

843
00:40:44,750 --> 00:40:47,625
<i>I'm</i> just like... [chuckling]
...anybody else.

844
00:40:48,833 --> 00:40:50,166
[girl laughing]

845
00:40:50,250 --> 00:40:51,666
Yeah, well...

846
00:40:52,625 --> 00:40:53,958
I never had a quince.

847
00:40:55,583 --> 00:40:56,583
Feels like I missed out.

848
00:40:56,666 --> 00:40:58,875
What were you doing when you were 15?

849
00:40:58,958 --> 00:41:00,041
Touring with J.Lo.

850
00:41:01,875 --> 00:41:06,375
Oh... oh yeah, yeah. You were
really deprived. [laughing] Sorry.

851
00:41:06,458 --> 00:41:11,791
And one, two, three, four,
and five and six and seven and eight.

852
00:41:11,875 --> 00:41:15,958
Cristina, would you like
to show Angelina your <i>baile sorpresa</i>?

853
00:41:16,041 --> 00:41:17,375
- What?
- Okay.

854
00:41:17,458 --> 00:41:19,666
Yeah, I would love to see it.

855
00:41:20,666 --> 00:41:22,916
[all giggling, talking indistinctly]

856
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:23,833
[softly] Okay.

857
00:41:23,916 --> 00:41:24,916
[exhales]

858
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,000
- Okay.
- Okay.

859
00:41:27,125 --> 00:41:28,958
- Hit it, <i>Tía!</i>
- [grunts]

860
00:41:29,041 --> 00:41:31,041
- ["Sweet and Spicy" playing]
- Oh, that's my song.

861
00:41:31,583 --> 00:41:33,583
Five, six, seven, eight.

862
00:41:33,666 --> 00:41:36,458
- And one, two, three... No, stop, stop!
- [song stops]

863
00:41:36,541 --> 00:41:38,750
- That's not it. That's not it.
- Oh. Ugh.

864

What's tripping you up
is the signature change

870

after the intro. Okay?

871
00:41:56,958 --> 00:41:59,750
But if you had a little choreography,
you can recover your timing.

872

You remember Cheri?

01:01:08,500 --> 01:01:10,166
- Hi!
- Of course. Oh. Okay.

1211
01:01:10,791 --> 01:01:13,416
- It's so good to see you again.
- Mm-hmm.

1212
01:01:13,500 --> 01:01:16,958
I just quickly wanted to say,
you are such an inspiration to me.

1213
01:01:18,083 --> 01:01:19,208
- Really?
- Yes!

1214
01:01:19,791 --> 01:01:22,166
I watched
the <i>Love It or Leave It </i>tour three times.

1215
01:01:22,875 --> 01:01:24,833
It really gives me inspiration
for my shows.

1216
01:01:24,916 --> 01:01:26,541
You watched it three times?

1217
01:01:27,125 --> 01:01:28,833
Okay, five. Okay, ten.

1218
01:01:29,916 --> 01:01:32,083
Wow. That's... that's very sweet.

1219

Cheri's playing <i>Saturday Night Live's</i>
Christmas special this week.

1220

Cheri, that is wonderful.

1223

And I wish you the absolute best.

1224
01:01:49,208 --> 01:01:51,916
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'm on in just a few minutes.

1225
01:01:52,416 --> 01:01:53,416
Can't wait.

[touching music playing]

1227
01:01:59,875 --> 01:02:02,458
- That didn't look fun.
- It wasn't actually that bad.

1228
01:02:03,208 --> 01:02:05,958
- You had that fake smile thing going.
- What do you mean?

1229
01:02:07,958 --> 01:02:08,875
- Stop.

- In just a few minutes.
- Do you get nervous?

1233
01:02:15,291 --> 01:02:16,291
No.

1234
01:02:17,083 --> 01:02:20,250
- I still get excited though.
- [scoffs] I... I can't even imagine.

1235
01:02:20,333 --> 01:02:23,625
I haven't performed in so long.
I don't even play in front of my students.

1236
01:02:23,708 --> 01:02:25,625
Aw, that's a shame.

1237
01:02:26,208 --> 01:02:28,166
People should get a chance
to hear you play.

1238
01:02:28,666 --> 01:02:29,916
No.

1239
01:02:31,041 --> 01:02:32,208
I can't do what you do.

1240
01:02:33,291 --> 01:02:34,291

So we have one last song for you tonight.

It's a very special song.

is here tonight.
