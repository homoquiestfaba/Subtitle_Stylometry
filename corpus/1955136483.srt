734
00:38:30,642 --> 00:38:32,909
               Um, I'll have
               an apple mojito,
               please.

                      Hey!

747
00:38:54,666 --> 00:38:56,700
       (CHUCKLES) Well,
       I like to drink.

748
00:38:56,702 --> 00:38:59,502
    I do, too! But we do
    lots of other things.

749
00:38:59,504 --> 00:39:01,604
   We hike and bike ride.
                      Yeah.

750
00:39:01,606 --> 00:39:03,940
      I love to read.
      Go to the movies.

         Jew's harp a little.

757
00:39:17,723 --> 00:39:18,788
           I don't like to
           say "Jew's harp"

758
00:39:18,790 --> 00:39:20,390
          because it's
          offensive to Jews.

           one of those, um,

761
00:39:25,831 --> 00:39:27,897

762
00:39:27,899 --> 00:39:29,532
            Is that right?

763
00:39:29,534 --> 00:39:31,501
        Or is it self-learning?

764
00:39:31,503 --> 00:39:33,503
  The Jew's harp
  is an underrated instrument.

765
00:39:33,505 --> 00:39:35,438
               I know!

766

     just this thing, you know?

             hotels like this.

862
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:51,394
          Emily and I splurged,
          because it's like
          a vacation.

863
00:43:51,396 --> 00:43:53,296
               I'm an idiot.
 (CHUCKLES) No, you're not.

864
00:43:54,399 --> 00:43:56,699
 Would you like a drink?

865
00:43:56,701 --> 00:43:59,702
           Yes, please. I would
           really like a drink.

866
00:43:59,704 --> 00:44:03,039
 I don't think I can
 make an apple mojito.
 I can order one.

867
00:44:03,041 --> 00:44:04,674
               No, that's okay.

868
00:44:04,676 --> 00:44:06,309
               I'll just have
               a glass of wine,
               please.

869
00:44:10,181 --> 00:44:11,814
   I'm glad to get you
   alone for a while.

870
00:44:12,817 --> 00:44:13,850
                   Yeah?
           Yeah.

871
00:44:16,321 --> 00:44:17,286
          You don't like Emily?

872
00:44:18,189 --> 00:44:19,656
         Everybody likes Emily.

873
00:44:20,358 --> 00:44:21,357
              Emily's a prince.

874
00:44:22,060 --> 00:44:23,026
                   Ess.

875
00:44:23,795 --> 00:44:25,094
            Emily's a princess.

876
00:44:25,096 --> 00:44:26,195
 She's very nice.

877
00:44:27,132 --> 00:44:29,132
  I just felt

878
00:44:29,134 --> 00:44:31,768
 a sort of
 special thing with you.

879
00:44:31,770 --> 00:44:33,369
                Really? Hmm.

880
00:44:34,406 --> 00:44:36,839
        Most people like Emily.

881
00:44:38,777 --> 00:44:39,742
               Thank you.
       Here you go.

882
00:44:39,744 --> 00:44:40,777
         (CHUCKLES)

883
00:44:40,779 --> 00:44:41,911
                 Thank you.

884
00:44:53,058 --> 00:44:55,224
            Most people don't
            really like to look
            at me too much

885
00:44:55,226 --> 00:44:56,859
           because, you know...

886
00:44:59,998 --> 00:45:02,198
 I think you're lovely.

887
00:45:03,234 --> 00:45:04,834
               No, you don't.

888
00:45:06,905 --> 00:45:08,971
    I've always done phone work
    because I'd never get hired

889
00:45:08,973 --> 00:45:11,307
          to work in a store
          or a restaurant or...

890
00:45:13,211 --> 00:45:15,211
 How did it happen?

891
00:45:16,815 --> 00:45:19,082
 If it's okay for me to ask?

892
00:45:20,085 --> 00:45:20,983
               I don't, um...

893
00:45:22,087 --> 00:45:23,486
              I don't like to
              talk about it.

894
00:45:26,224 --> 00:45:27,490
 May I kiss you there?

895
00:45:29,227 --> 00:45:30,259
                 Oh, my God.

896
00:45:31,863 --> 00:45:32,729
          Oh, my God. No.

897
00:45:33,298 --> 00:45:34,263
                Oh, God.

898
00:45:40,305 --> 00:45:41,321
       (STAMMERS) Sorry.

899
00:45:41,322 --> 00:45:42,338
        You're not like
        a pervert or something?

900
00:45:42,340 --> 00:45:43,973
        Like some weird version
        of a chubby chaser?

901
00:45:43,975 --> 00:45:45,141
    No.

902
00:45:47,178 --> 00:45:49,412
        I just don't understand
        why you would want to
        kiss me there.

903
00:45:51,015 --> 00:45:52,849
         Because...

904
00:45:52,851 --> 00:45:55,284
     Because I like you.

905
00:45:55,286 --> 00:45:56,219
                   Oh.

906
00:45:57,188 --> 00:45:58,221
                 Why?

907
00:46:00,258 --> 00:46:02,158
              I mean, I'm not
              smart like Emily.
              And I'm ugly.

908
00:46:03,428 --> 00:46:06,429
     You're a really smart guy.
     You should like Emily.

909
00:46:06,431 --> 00:46:08,264
        I don't even understand
        a lot of the words
        in your book.

910
00:46:08,266 --> 00:46:10,366
               I sat there with
               a dictionary.

911
00:46:10,368 --> 00:46:12,301
             I try to learn.
             But I'm never
             going to be smart.

912
00:46:13,104 --> 00:46:14,437
                  And I'm ugly.

913
00:46:14,439 --> 00:46:16,172
 I find it
 enormously charming

914
00:46:16,174 --> 00:46:18,407
 that you read any book
 with a dictionary next to you.

915
00:46:21,412 --> 00:46:22,345
          (SIGHS)

916
00:46:26,417 --> 00:46:27,350
             (EXHALES)

917
00:46:48,306 --> 00:46:52,175
          My last boyfriend
          was eight years ago.

918
00:46:52,177 --> 00:46:53,409
           And he wasn't
           even my boyfriend.

919
00:46:53,411 --> 00:46:55,111
       He was almost 60 and fat

920
00:46:55,113 --> 00:46:58,181
          and he worked in
          Human Resources

921
00:46:58,183 --> 00:47:00,349
         and he had a wife
         and his daughter
         was older than me.

922
00:47:01,820 --> 00:47:04,253
         And the only reason
         he pursued me

923
00:47:04,255 --> 00:47:05,988
        was because he thought
        he'd have a good shot.

924
00:47:05,990 --> 00:47:07,089
             Which he did.

925
00:47:10,161 --> 00:47:11,360
              I think you're
              extraordinary.

926
00:47:19,437 --> 00:47:20,469
        Why?

927
00:47:22,407 --> 00:47:23,573
             I don't know yet.

928
00:47:24,976 --> 00:47:26,342
            It's just obvious
            to me that you are.

929
00:47:27,545 --> 00:47:30,046
 I never went to college.

930
00:47:30,048 --> 00:47:32,048
 I've never even made it past
 team leader in my department.

931
00:47:32,951 --> 00:47:35,251
           Your voice is like

932
00:47:36,387 --> 00:47:37,353
                  magic.

933
00:47:39,557 --> 00:47:40,489
     Oh, really?

934
00:47:44,529 --> 00:47:45,712
        Wow.

935
00:47:45,713 --> 00:47:46,896
 Well, you know,
 I have been doing

936
00:47:46,898 --> 00:47:49,899
 phone work for
 a really long time now,

937
00:47:49,901 --> 00:47:54,003
 so I pride myself on sounding
 pleasant and professional,

938
00:47:54,005 --> 00:47:55,972
 and having a pleasing
 phone voice and manner.

939
00:47:56,941 --> 00:47:58,941
         It works. Do you sing?

940
00:47:59,577 --> 00:48:02,111
 (LAUGHS) What? No.

941
00:48:03,081 --> 00:48:04,647
       No! God!

942
00:48:04,649 --> 00:48:05,915
    You're weird!

943
00:48:06,985 --> 00:48:08,150
  I mean, I sing.
  Everybody sings.

944
00:48:08,152 --> 00:48:10,152
 I just don't sing well.

945
00:48:10,154 --> 00:48:12,355
 I sometimes sing along
 with the radio.

946
00:48:12,357 --> 00:48:13,589
 I love Cyndi Lauper.

947
00:48:15,026 --> 00:48:16,659
 Because she's got
 such a great voice

948
00:48:16,661 --> 00:48:18,995
 and she doesn't care
 what people think about her.

949
00:48:18,997 --> 00:48:21,230
 She's just herself,
 and that takes
 a lot of courage.

950
00:48:21,232 --> 00:48:23,032
 I admire that.
 You know what I mean?

951
00:48:23,034 --> 00:48:24,300
             Yeah. I think so.

952
00:48:25,937 --> 00:48:27,570
       Would you sing
       one of her songs for me?

953
00:48:27,572 --> 00:48:28,638
     (SCOFFS) No!

954
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:31,007
                  Come on.

955
00:48:31,009 --> 00:48:33,576
       Come on. It'd make me so
       happy to hear you sing.

956
00:48:33,578 --> 00:48:35,311
 You're being weird.
                        Please.

957
00:48:36,614 --> 00:48:38,014
           It'll make me happy.

958
00:48:40,451 --> 00:48:41,317

00:52:22,140 --> 00:52:24,340

1019
00:52:24,342 --> 00:52:26,509
              Well, Em picked
              me up at, like,
              7:00 this morning

1020
00:52:26,511 --> 00:52:27,910
              so we could
              drive down here.

1021
00:52:27,912 --> 00:52:30,179
        We stopped at Starbucks

1022
00:52:30,181 --> 00:52:31,647
            and I got a Grande
            Mocha Frappuccino.

1023
00:52:32,717 --> 00:52:34,683
       Emily got a Grande Chai.

1024
00:52:34,685 --> 00:52:35,918
           I looked at the road
           atlas and figured

1025
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:37,753
            it's a little over
            200 miles,

1026
00:52:37,755 --> 00:52:39,889
        so at 60 miles an hour,
        we could do it in under
        four hours

1027

00:52:42,760 --> 00:52:47,229
            The 71 goes pretty
            much straight here,
            so it was easy.

1029
00:52:48,699 --> 00:52:51,534
             We listened to
             a lot of No Doubt,
             which Em likes.

1030
00:52:51,536 --> 00:52:54,270
           And I brought my
           Sarah Brightman CDs.

            I love French and
            Italian the most.

1045
00:53:54,465 --> 00:53:56,899
          I don't like German.
          It sounds mean to me.

            Brazilian singers.

1050

          They sing in
          Portuguese in Brazil,
          a little-known fact.

               in Portuguese.

              It's an anomaly,
              right?
         Uh-huh.

1055
00:54:22,927 --> 00:54:24,693

       there was a word for it,

1061

            to be different.

01:08:26,770 --> 01:08:28,870
         They're all one person
         and they love me.

1282
01:08:28,872 --> 01:08:31,773
        Everyone is one person,
        but you and me.

1283
01:08:31,775 --> 01:08:33,441
         You're the
         only other person
         in the world!

1284
01:08:35,312 --> 01:08:36,511
            Really?

1285
01:08:38,748 --> 01:08:40,648
   That's so beautiful.

1286
01:08:45,222 --> 01:08:46,938
 I'm going to cry.

1287
01:08:46,939 --> 01:08:48,655
             No, we need
             to stay together.
             Forever.

1288
01:08:48,658 --> 01:08:51,593
         To protect each other,
         to nurture each other.

1289
01:08:51,595 --> 01:08:55,196
   Oh, my God.
   Oh, my God, that's...
   Are you sure?

1290
01:08:55,198 --> 01:08:56,464
                   Yes.

1291
01:08:57,868 --> 01:09:03,138
       Yes. Finally.
       Finally, I've found you.

1292
01:09:03,140 --> 01:09:05,673
  I've waited so long
  for someone to...

1293
01:09:06,643 --> 01:09:08,409
  And you're so smart.

1294
01:09:08,411 --> 01:09:09,744
    We have to get out of here.

1295
01:09:09,746 --> 01:09:11,579
 My clothes. My stuff.
              We'll get new.

1296
01:09:11,581 --> 01:09:13,915
  Your wife and son.

1297
01:09:13,916 --> 01:09:16,250
     They don't exist.
     They're just them. (GASPS)
 (POUNDING ON DOOR)

1298
01:09:16,253 --> 01:09:17,785
 PERSON 1: Michael? Michael?
    PERSON 2: Michael? Michael?

1299
01:09:17,787 --> 01:09:19,254
    PERSON 3: Michael? Michael?
 LISA: Michael?

1300
01:09:19,256 --> 01:09:20,522
                LISA: <i> Michael?</i>

1301
01:09:20,524 --> 01:09:21,456
          (VOICES ECHOING)

1302
01:09:22,492 --> 01:09:23,725
        Michael!
                   MICHAEL: Oh.

1303
01:09:23,727 --> 01:09:24,826
 You're having a nightmare
 or something.

1304
01:09:25,362 --> 01:09:26,294
                      (GASPS)

1305
01:09:26,663 --> 01:09:28,396
                     Oh, man.

1306
01:09:28,398 --> 01:09:30,665
 You were thrashing.

1307
01:09:30,667 --> 01:09:32,267
 You hit me in the face
 with your elbow.

1308
01:09:32,269 --> 01:09:33,668
                 Oh, I'm sorry.

1309
01:09:33,670 --> 01:09:35,403
 Oh, it's okay.

1310
01:09:35,405 --> 01:09:37,839
 I kind of liked it.
 It's kind of intimate.

1311
01:09:39,442 --> 01:09:41,943
                (CHUCKLES)
                Oh, okay, then.
                Stick around.

1312
01:09:41,945 --> 01:09:44,379
          I'm sure you'll
          get more of those.
          I'm a sloppy sleeper.

1313
01:09:45,182 --> 01:09:46,748
 You're all sweaty.

1314
01:09:48,485 --> 01:09:49,450
 What was the dream?

1315
01:09:50,453 --> 01:09:51,719
                  I don't know.

1316
01:09:53,290 --> 01:09:56,624
             Something about
             the hotel manager.

1317
01:10:05,535 --> 01:10:07,669
      Are you hungry?
      We could order breakfast.

1318
01:10:07,671 --> 01:10:09,337
            I have to get ready
            for this speech.

1319
01:10:10,440 --> 01:10:11,806
 Can I have scrambled eggs?

1320
01:10:11,808 --> 01:10:13,675
                      Sure.

1321
01:10:13,677 --> 01:10:16,911
      I love eggs. Scrambled is
      my favorite egg style.

1322
01:10:17,814 --> 01:10:18,680
          What about yours?

1323
01:10:22,285 --> 01:10:23,251
         Mmm!

1324
01:10:23,987 --> 01:10:25,753
 These eggs are delicious.

1325
01:10:25,755 --> 01:10:27,922
 They're scrambled perfectly.
 Do you want to try some?

1326
01:10:27,924 --> 01:10:30,258
             No. Now here's
             what I'm thinking.

1327
01:10:30,260 --> 01:10:31,559
          Yes?

1328
01:10:31,561 --> 01:10:32,627
         I want to be with you.

1329
01:10:33,530 --> 01:10:35,463
  What do you mean?

1330
01:10:35,465 --> 01:10:37,532
       I need to be with you.
       I want to leave my wife.

1331
01:10:39,002 --> 01:10:41,002
         Really?

1332
01:10:41,004 --> 01:10:42,403
 Michael, that's a big
 decision. I don't...

1333
01:10:42,405 --> 01:10:43,871
               No, no, no,

1334
01:10:43,873 --> 01:10:45,907
  it's something I have to do.
  I mean, if you're interested.

1335
01:10:47,944 --> 01:10:50,511
 I mean, yeah. I mean,
 it's awfully sudden.

1336
01:10:50,513 --> 01:10:52,880
  I mean, I don't want
  to be responsible

1337
01:10:52,882 --> 01:10:54,849
  for breaking up a marriage.

1338
01:10:54,851 --> 01:10:56,684
 Do we need to decide now?

1339
01:10:56,686 --> 01:10:59,787
            It's been years
            since I've felt
            anything like this.

1340
01:10:59,789 --> 01:11:01,422
        It's like
        a floodgate has opened.

1341
01:11:01,424 --> 01:11:03,258
             I can't close it.
             I don't want to.
             I love you.

1342
01:11:05,428 --> 01:11:07,795
       Okay. Um...

1343
01:11:07,797 --> 01:11:10,765
 I don't know.
 It seems so big and...

1344
01:11:10,767 --> 01:11:13,568
  Oh, gosh, okay.
  Yeah, let's do it.

1345
01:11:15,572 --> 01:11:18,473
       Great! This is so great!

1346
01:11:18,475 --> 01:11:19,540
                 Anomalisa.
                 (CHUCKLES)

1347
01:11:21,044 --> 01:11:23,711
           So, I'll call Donna
           and tell her.

1348
01:11:25,282 --> 01:11:25,947
         No, maybe I should
         go and see her, right?

1349
01:11:26,716 --> 01:11:29,350
    Yeah, that sounds right.

1350
01:11:29,352 --> 01:11:30,418
      I think that's
      such an important...

1351
01:11:30,420 --> 01:11:32,887
    (STAMMERS) Could you not...

1352
01:11:32,889 --> 01:11:34,322
      You're clicking your fork
      against your teeth.

1353
01:11:34,324 --> 01:11:35,356
        Could you not do that?

1354
01:11:35,358 --> 01:11:37,058
         Oh, sorry.

1355
01:11:37,060 --> 01:11:38,593
     People have told
     me that before.

1356
01:11:38,595 --> 01:11:40,628
  I know, it's a stupid
  unconscious habit.

1357
01:11:40,630 --> 01:11:42,764
      It's okay.
      Anyway, you were saying?

1358
01:11:42,766 --> 01:11:45,300
   Mmm. Just that I think
   it's more respectful.

1359
01:11:45,302 --> 01:11:46,601
     And you need to
     speak to Henry

1360
01:11:46,603 --> 01:11:48,403
   and explain that
   this isn't about him.

1361
01:11:48,405 --> 01:11:50,438
        But it is.
        It's about him, too.

1362
01:11:50,774 --> 01:11:52,774
              Oh.

1363
01:11:52,776 --> 01:11:54,876
  Well, don't tell him that.
  He's just a little boy.

1364
01:11:54,878 --> 01:11:56,878
         Yeah. You're right.

1365
01:11:59,516 --> 01:12:02,317
        You're being
        a little controlling,
        don't you think?

1366
01:12:03,353 --> 01:12:04,419
  I don't mean to. I'm sorry.

1367
01:12:04,421 --> 01:12:05,687
         No, that's okay.

1368
01:12:05,689 --> 01:12:07,689
     Good. I'm glad...
             (GRUNTS)

1369
01:12:07,691 --> 01:12:10,658
         Please don't talk
         with food hanging
         out of your mouth.

1370
01:12:10,660 --> 01:12:12,927
      Oh, sorry.
      I'm a pig. Sorry.
                            No.

1371
01:12:12,929 --> 01:12:15,029
       No, no, no. It's okay.

1372
01:12:15,031 --> 01:12:16,364
         So, will you live
         in Los Angeles,

1373
01:12:16,366 --> 01:12:17,999
          or do you need
          to stay in Ohio?

1374
01:12:18,001 --> 01:12:20,368
      Um... I'm sorry.
      Hold on.

1375
01:12:21,504 --> 01:12:22,770
          (HUMMING)

1376
01:12:31,348 --> 01:12:33,715
 I can move to Los Angeles.
 I could do that.

1377
01:12:33,717 --> 01:12:34,816
              Good.

1378
01:12:36,486 --> 01:12:38,119
 We should
 go to the zoo today
 after your speech.

1379
01:12:38,121 --> 01:12:39,887
 I hear it's really good.

1380
01:12:39,889 --> 01:12:41,522
 They have breeding programs

1381
01:12:41,524 --> 01:12:43,424
 for all these
 endangered species.

1382
01:12:43,426 --> 01:12:44,726
             (GULPS)

1383
01:12:44,728 --> 01:12:45,927
  I'm sorry, what did you say?

1384
01:12:47,397 --> 01:12:48,996
    LISA AND MALE VOICE: Oh.
    They have breeding programs

1385
01:12:48,998 --> 01:12:50,865
         for all these
         endangered species.

1386
01:12:50,867 --> 01:12:53,501
          So you get to see
          things like pandas,

1387
01:12:53,503 --> 01:12:55,536
          which I think
          are awfully cute.

1388
01:12:55,538 --> 01:12:59,107
      They're not really
      bears, I read. (CHUCKLES)

1389
01:12:59,109 --> 01:13:02,910
       Yeah. Sure.
       That sounds fine.

1390
01:13:05,115 --> 01:13:06,047
            What is it?

1391
01:13:07,050 --> 01:13:08,649
 Nothing. The zoo sounds good.

1392
01:13:10,820 --> 01:13:13,955
       My stomach hurts.
       It feels empty.
       It's clenched.

1393
01:13:16,860 --> 01:13:17,892
                 Oh.

1394
01:13:17,893 --> 01:13:18,925
        Well, eat some more
        waffle maybe?

1395
01:13:21,398 --> 01:13:22,997
     Did I do something wrong?

1396
01:13:24,901 --> 01:13:27,602
         I'm sorry. Darling.

1397
01:13:27,604 --> 01:13:28,703
         It's okay.

1398
01:13:30,440 --> 01:13:32,907
   I'm anxious about
   my speech, I suppose.

1399
01:13:32,909 --> 01:13:33,975
                 Of course.

1400
01:13:34,878 --> 01:13:36,711
    Well, we'll have fun after.

1401
01:13:36,713 --> 01:13:37,745
             We don't have
             to go to the zoo.

1402
01:13:37,747 --> 01:13:39,781
     We can just hang out here.

1403
01:13:39,783 --> 01:13:41,416
       I have the whole weekend
       till I have to get back
       to work.

1404
01:13:41,418 --> 01:13:42,417
       That's great.

1405
01:13:43,153 --> 01:13:45,853
       I'm so happy, Michael.

1406
01:13:45,855 --> 01:13:47,889
         I've waited for
         someone like you
         my whole life.

1407
01:13:49,759 --> 01:13:51,092
      I've waited, too.

1408
01:13:52,829 --> 01:13:54,862
 We'll work it all out, right?

1409
01:13:54,864 --> 01:13:58,766
    Yes. Who would've thunk it?
    It's just so beautiful.

1410
01:13:59,669 --> 01:14:00,935
           Life can be.

1411
01:14:02,105 --> 01:14:03,604
       Things can work out.
       That's the lesson.

1412
01:14:05,542 --> 01:14:08,876
 Sometimes there's no lesson.
 That's a lesson in itself.

1413
01:14:10,814 --> 01:14:12,079
            I guess so.

1414
01:14:14,017 --> 01:14:16,517
     I feel anxious, Michael.

1415
01:14:16,519 --> 01:14:19,120
  I feel something.
  Like you're different-acting.

1416
01:14:19,122 --> 01:14:21,923
    Me? No, no, no.
    Everything's fine.
    I'm just...

1417
01:14:21,925 --> 01:14:24,559
              I know.

1418
01:14:24,561 --> 01:14:26,227
       I'm not great to look
       at in bright sunlight.

1419
01:14:26,229 --> 01:14:27,995
   No, you're very pretty.

1420
01:14:29,032 --> 01:14:30,231
