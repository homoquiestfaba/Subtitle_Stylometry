00:10:29,816 --> 00:10:32,485
<i>- Sir... slow down. What is your name?
- Paul. Paul Conroy</i>

14
00:10:32,610 --> 00:10:34,738
<i>Okay, Mister Conroy. Can you tell
me your location?</i>

15
00:10:34,739 --> 00:10:37,650
I don’t know. I’m in a coffin.
I don’t know where.

16
00:10:37,651 --> 00:10:38,951
Please help me.
I’m scared.

17
00:10:39,075 --> 00:10:40,245
<i>- You’re in a coffin?
- Yes.</i>

18
00:10:40,246 --> 00:10:42,046
It’s, like, one of those old,
wooden ones.

19
00:10:42,370 --> 00:10:45,232
<i>- Are you at a funeral home?
- No. I don’t know. No.</i>

20
00:10:45,325 --> 00:10:47,385
<i>- How are calling me right now?
- What?</i>

21
00:10:47,544 --> 00:10:50,370
<i>If you’re buried in a coffin, where
are you calling from?</i>

22
00:10:51,003 --> 00:10:52,581
A cell phone. There was an old
cell phone in the coffin.

23
00:10:52,582 --> 00:10:55,651
<i>- You’re calling from your cell phone?
- Yes, yes, yes...</i>

24
00:10:55,652 --> 00:10:58,137
No. It’s not mine, but yes,
I’m calling from a cell phone.

25
00:10:58,138 --> 00:11:00,657
<i>There was a cell phone in the
coffin when you climbed in?</i>

26
00:11:00,658 --> 00:11:04,434
Yes... Wath?
I didn’t climb in.

27
00:11:04,435 --> 00:11:06,697
<i>- How did you end up in the coffin, sir?
- I was put here.</i>

28
00:11:06,698 --> 00:11:10,082
<i>- In the coffin?
- Yes. Please, help.</i>

29
00:11:10,083 --> 00:11:11,985
<i>And you’re saying
the coffin is buried?</i>

30
00:11:12,086 --> 00:11:14,028
Yes. I’m a truck driver, an
American.

31
00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:17,298
It’s... it’s hot in
here and i can’t breathe.

32
00:11:17,299 --> 00:11:18,657
<i>Do you know your location, sir?</i>

33
00:11:18,658 --> 00:11:21,458
I... I told you.
Somewhere in Iraq.

34
00:11:21,459 --> 00:11:22,459
- Please, help me!
- Iraq?

35
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:25,616
Yes. I’m a truck driver, an
American. I work for CRT.

36
00:11:25,617 --> 00:11:27,654
<i>- Are you a soldier, sir?
- No. Please, you have to listen to me.</i>

37
00:11:27,655 --> 00:11:31,933
I’m a truck driver. An American.
I’m a civilian contractor working in Iraq.

38
00:11:31,968 --> 00:11:34,023
We were attacked
in Baqubah, they shot...

39
00:11:35,158 --> 00:11:36,928
They shot them.
All of them.

40
00:11:37,053 --> 00:11:39,264
<i>- They shot who, sir?
- All of the other drivers.</i>

41
00:11:39,389 --> 00:11:41,849
<i>And you’re saying this happened in
Iraq? The country?</i>

42
00:11:41,850 --> 00:11:43,550
Yeah! Please
Listen to me, okay?

43
00:11:43,551 --> 00:11:45,820
Listen, they gave me a safety
number, and it in my wallet...

44
00:11:45,821 --> 00:11:47,621
And i don't know were it is now.

45
00:11:47,622 --> 00:11:51,277
<i>Mister Conroy, this is 911
emergency in Youngstown, Ohio.</i>

46
00:11:52,678 --> 00:11:53,800
<i>- Ohio?
- Yes, sir.</i>

47
00:11:53,901 --> 00:11:55,539
<i>I’m not sure exactly how
you called here...</i>

48
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:56,740
<i>if you’re in
another country...</i>

49
00:11:56,864 --> 00:11:57,342
But if you’d like...

50
00:11:57,343 --> 00:11:59,043
I can patch you through to the
Sheriff’s Department.

51
00:11:59,044 --> 00:12:01,100
No... you don’t underst...
Forget it.

52
00:12:25,144 --> 00:12:26,479
Pick up, pick up, please.

53
00:12:32,811 --> 00:12:34,692
<i>Thanks for calling the Conroy’s.</i>

54
00:12:34,693 --> 00:12:35,993
<i>We’re not home right now.</i>

00:12:38,617 --> 00:12:40,980
Yeah, Linda!
Linda, honey, it’s me.

57
00:12:40,981 --> 00:12:45,666
I need you to contact the National
Guard right away... Or the Pentagon.

58
00:12:45,991 --> 00:12:49,837
Tell them we were attacked in the
Diyala Provence, in Baqubah.

59
00:12:49,962 --> 00:12:52,284
They need to find me, okay?

60
00:12:52,285 --> 00:12:54,885
Please, baby.
Help them find me.

61
00:13:03,142 --> 00:13:05,263

66
00:13:14,634 --> 00:13:16,690
Okay? I don’t know what
the hell is going on...

67
00:13:18,650 --> 00:13:19,787
I’m buried in a
box...

68
00:13:21,322 --> 00:13:22,322
I’m buried in a
box...

69
00:13:24,957 --> 00:13:26,634
I can’t breathe in here.

70
00:13:27,793 --> 00:13:31,380
Call me right away.
Please, baby.

71
00:14:18,762 --> 00:14:19,733

Um... I don’t know.
The F.B.I. wherever they are.

73
00:14:21,935 --> 00:14:24,229
<i>Do you have a specific city you’d
like to be connected to?</i>

74
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:26,530
Anywhere, any city.
Just connect me to the F.B.I.

75
00:14:26,531 --> 00:14:29,218
<i>Sir, I have F.B.I. field offices
listed in Boston...</i>

76
00:14:29,253 --> 00:14:32,953
<i>- Chicago, New York, Philadelphia, New Have...
- It doesn't matter.</i>

77
00:14:32,954 --> 00:14:35,198
Any city, Anywhere!
just connect me, please!

78
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:36,699
<i>I’m sorry, sir,
but I’m not allowed to do that.</i>

79
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:40,327
<i>- Chicago, fine! Chicago, okay?
- There's no need to be rude, sir.</i>

80
00:14:40,328 --> 00:14:42,087
<i>Please hold for your number.</i>

81
00:14:42,612 --> 00:14:56,700
<i>The number you requested,

82
00:14:56,701 --> 00:15:00,600

83
00:15:00,601 --> 00:15:02,401
<i>by pressing the number one.</i>

84
00:15:07,563 --> 00:15:09,057
<i>Chicago field office.
Special Agent Harris.</i>

85
00:15:09,058 --> 00:15:10,717
- Is this the F.B.I.?
- Yes it is, sir.

86
00:15:10,718 --> 00:15:13,745
I’m calling from Iraq. I’m buried
in the desert somewhere.

87
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:15,733
- I need you to help me...
- Whoa, whoa, sir. Slow down.

88
00:15:15,734 --> 00:15:18,075
<i>- When were you in Iraq?
- Now. I’m there now.</i>

89
00:15:18,076 --> 00:15:21,562
I’m a truck driver for CRT.
I’ve been here for nine months.

90
00:15:21,563 --> 00:15:24,801
<i>- May I have your name please, sir?
- Paul Conroy.</i>

91
00:15:25,197 --> 00:15:26,814
Paul Conroy.

92
00:15:27,434 --> 00:15:29,751
<i>Okay, Paul,
explain to me what’s going on.</i>

93
00:15:32,665 --> 00:15:34,987
Me and a convoy of other drivers...

94
00:15:34,988 --> 00:15:37,288
Were delivering some kitchen
supplies to a community center.

95
00:15:37,712 --> 00:15:41,949
Some kids started
throwing rocks at the trucks.

96
00:15:42,075 --> 00:15:46,150
Then an IED went off up ahead and
blew up one of the other trucks.

97
00:15:47,213 --> 00:15:49,474
And these guys came out
from behind the houses...

98
00:15:49,475 --> 00:15:52,475
with guns and started shooting everyone...
right there on the street.

99
00:15:52,567 --> 00:15:53,356
<i>Were you shot at?</i>

100
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:54,551
I don’t know!

101
00:15:55,016 --> 00:15:57,048
I don’t know. I was way in the
back of the convoy.

102
00:15:57,373 --> 00:16:01,795
I guess i got hit in the head with
one of the rocks and blacked out.

103
00:16:01,830 --> 00:16:02,910
That’s the last thing I remember.

104
00:16:02,911 --> 00:16:05,800
And I woke up here,
tied up in a coffin.

105
00:16:05,835 --> 00:16:08,755
<i>- Who put you there?
- I guess whoever ambushed us.</i>

106
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,882
<i>- A bunch of kids?
- No, no, no.</i>

107
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:13,317
The kids threw the rocks at us.

108
00:16:13,745 --> 00:16:17,400
but then some Iraqi guys... maybe
insurgents, I don’t fucking know...

109
00:16:17,678 --> 00:16:20,660
They just popped out and started
shooting everybody right there on the street.

110
00:16:20,661 --> 00:16:21,536
<i>I thought you said they didn’t
shoot at you.</i>

111
00:16:21,537 --> 00:16:23,771
They didn’t, I don’t know!
But they shot them!

112
00:16:23,772 --> 00:16:24,930
<i>Sir, you’re going to have
to stop shouting...</i>

113
00:16:24,931 --> 00:16:27,331
I’m shouting because
you’re not listening to me!

114
00:16:27,332 --> 00:16:28,181
I need you to help me!

115
00:16:30,345 --> 00:16:31,900
Okay, okay, okay!

116
00:16:34,030 --> 00:16:37,128
Can you trace my call?
GPS or something?

117
00:16:38,442 --> 00:16:40,269
<i>Why is it that they
didn’t shoot you?</i>

118
00:16:42,716 --> 00:16:46,210
I don't know, i have no idea.
They didn’t, that’s all I know.

119
00:16:47,011 --> 00:16:48,378
<i>What’s your social
security number?</i>

120
00:16:48,878 --> 00:16:54,149
Why? Why?
Who cares?

121
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:56,108
I’m buried in the
middle of the fucking desert!

122
00:16:56,109 --> 00:16:57,613
Who cares what my social
security number is?!

123
00:16:57,614 --> 00:17:01,220
I’m an American citizen.
Just send someone to find me, please!

124
00:17:01,221 --> 00:17:05,069
- Do you know where you’re... lo... if... dy..
- Hold on! I can’t hear you.

125
00:17:05,729 --> 00:17:07,255
What did you...
Hold on!

126
00:17:08,107 --> 00:17:08,834
No, no, no, just...

127
00:17:09,495 --> 00:17:11,346
Shit!

128
00:17:42,029 --> 00:17:43,860
<i>Thank you for calling Crestin,
Roland and Thomas.</i>

129
00:17:43,861 --> 00:17:45,217
<i>How may I
direct your call?</i>

130
00:17:45,252 --> 00:17:47,741
Somebody, I need to talk to someone
right away. It’s an emergency.

131
00:17:47,742 --> 00:17:49,301
<i>Who is this, please?</i>

132
00:17:49,552 --> 00:17:50,530
It's Paul Conroy.

133
00:17:50,865 --> 00:17:52,941
I’m a driver for you
guys. I’m calling from Iraq.

134
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:53,996
My convoy was attacked.

135
00:17:53,997 --> 00:17:55,141
<i>Sir, if this is a crisis situation.</i>

136
00:17:55,142 --> 00:17:56,943
<i>you need to contact the Safety
Number your were provided.</i>

137
00:17:57,138 --> 00:17:59,636
I know, I know, but I don’t have it anymore.
The people took it.

138
00:17:59,637 --> 00:18:00,683
<i>Who took it, sir?</i>

139
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:03,310
The Iraqis, I think.
I blacked out.

140
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:05,877
<i>I’m going to put you through to
Alan Davenport.</i>

141
00:18:05,878 --> 00:18:07,229
Davenport? Who’s that?

142
00:18:07,449 --> 00:18:09,121
<i>Director of Personnel.
Please hold.</i>

143
00:18:09,122 --> 00:18:10,571
Personnel?
No, no, wait, wait...

144
00:18:14,953 --> 00:18:17,361
<i>At CRT, we work with our clients...</i>

145
00:18:17,362 --> 00:18:19,662

sustainable solutions...</i>

146

00:18:24,369 --> 00:18:26,373

152
00:18:33,295 --> 00:18:35,954
This is Paul Conroy, I’m from
Hastings, Michigan.

153
00:18:35,955 --> 00:18:38,443
I’m a driver for CRT,
my convoy was ambushed...

154
00:18:38,444 --> 00:18:40,698
by terrorists or
insurgents. I don’t know.

155
00:18:40,699 --> 00:18:41,936
I don’t know who it was.

156
00:18:42,181 --> 00:18:47,797
I’m stuck, buried in a coffin.
Please send help. I’m begging you.

157
00:18:48,652 --> 00:18:50,443
I think I’m in Baqubah
in the Diyala Provence.

158
00:18:50,444 --> 00:18:54,095
Please send help right away.
I can’t breathe in here.

159
00:18:54,130 --> 00:18:56,660
I can’t breathe.
I don’t know who else to call.

160
00:18:56,795 --> 00:18:57,880
Please send help...

161
00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:00,854

No, no I’m not a soldier.

00:21:11,175 --> 00:21:13,378
I’m a truck driver.

190
00:22:03,014 --> 00:22:07,101
My family doesn’t have five million

- What?
- Donna, I’m very sorry I yelled.

233
00:27:46,449 --> 00:27:48,049
I shouldn't have done that.

234
00:27:48,950 --> 00:27:51,147
But, I’m only going to ask you once
more to get me this number.

235
00:27:51,148 --> 00:27:52,997
If you don’t, I’m going to die.

236
00:27:52,998 --> 00:27:54,387
What?

237
00:27:54,388 --> 00:27:56,388
Please, I don’t have time
to explain... the number.

238
00:27:56,682 --> 00:27:58,223
<i>Hold on.</i>

239
00:28:01,984 --> 00:28:02,888
<i>Okay...</i>

240
00:28:03,081 --> 00:28:04,440

00:28:04,726 --> 00:28:07,193

4750.

244
00:28:11,505 --> 00:28:12,821
- 4750?
- Yeah.

245
00:28:13,423 --> 00:28:14,409
Okay, fuck you!

246
00:28:24,284 --> 00:28:25,716
- United States Department of State.
- I’m an American citizen...

247
00:28:25,930 --> 00:28:27,076
working in Iraq.
I’ve been taken hostage.

248
00:28:27,246 --> 00:28:28,496
I need to speak to
someone right away.

249
00:28:28,516 --> 00:28:30,504
- Where are you calling from, sir?
- From Iraq.

250
00:28:30,505 --> 00:28:33,565
I’m a truck driver for CRT,
Crestin, Roland and Thomas.

251
00:28:33,566 --> 00:28:36,089
We were attacked and now
I’m being held for ransom.

252
00:28:36,090 --> 00:28:39,009
- Are the kidnappers with you?
- No. I’m buried somewhere.

253
00:28:39,135 --> 00:28:40,783
- You’re buried?
- Yeah, in a coffin.

254
00:28:41,198 --> 00:28:42,672
A wooden box.
It’s an old coffin, I think.

255
00:28:43,222 --> 00:28:45,173
Did you try contacting
the military out there?

256
00:28:45,208 --> 00:28:47,203
I was given a number to call,
a safety number.

257
00:28:47,204 --> 00:28:48,204
But the people took it.

258
00:28:48,561 --> 00:28:50,521
- The people holding you hostage?
- Yeah, yeah!

259
00:28:50,522 --> 00:28:54,108
- Hold on. Let me connect you...
- No. Don't put me on hold... No!

260
00:29:03,534 --> 00:29:04,493
- Rebecca Browning.
- Hello?

261
00:29:04,995 --> 00:29:06,769
Yes, hello. I was just
informed of your situation.

262
00:29:07,289 --> 00:29:08,225
Yeah, my situation.

263
00:29:08,226 --> 00:29:09,949
I’m running out of time and you
people keep putting me on hold.

264
00:29:09,950 --> 00:29:11,785
- What the hell is wrong with you?
- I’m sorry.

265
00:29:11,910 --> 00:29:12,870
Don’t be sorry. Just help me.

266
00:29:12,995 --> 00:29:14,576
I just have a few questions for
you, Mister Conroy.

267
00:29:14,650 --> 00:29:15,650
You’ve got to be kidding me.

268
00:29:15,651 --> 00:29:16,611
It’s important that
I get this information.

269
00:29:16,727 --> 00:29:18,611
- It will make a rescue attempt...
- Wait, wait, wait...

270
00:29:20,542 --> 00:29:22,018
- How did you know my name?
- I’m sorry?

271
00:29:22,701 --> 00:29:25,878
I never gave you my name.
I don’t think I gave it to the other guy, either.

272
00:29:27,295 --> 00:29:28,488
What the hell is going
on right now?

273
00:29:29,304 --> 00:29:32,322
<i>We received a call from a
representative at CRT.</i>

274
00:29:32,357 --> 00:29:33,280
- You left him a message?
- Yeah...

275
00:29:33,611 --> 00:29:34,782
- He contacted us right away.
- Well, since you know what the hell...

276
00:29:34,783 --> 00:29:36,783
is going on, what have you done to
get me out of here?

277
00:29:36,972 --> 00:29:38,733
<i>There’s little we can
do from Washington.</i>

278
00:29:39,161 --> 00:29:42,595
So, that’s it? I’m just supposed to rot in
here because there’s little you can do?

279
00:29:42,885 --> 00:29:43,735
- No.
- Then what?

280
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:45,944
<i>I need to know where you were when
your convoy was ambushed.</i>

281
00:29:45,945 --> 00:29:47,803
In Baqubah.
In the Diyala Provence.

282
00:29:48,198 --> 00:29:49,575
Okay. And has contact been made
with the kidnappers?

283
00:29:49,797 --> 00:29:52,197
Yes. The guy told me that he wants five
million dollars by nine o’clock tonight.

284
00:29:52,198 --> 00:29:53,008
Or else...?

285
00:29:53,043 --> 00:29:57,799
Or else he’ll bring me to Sea World.
What do you think, lady?

286
00:29:58,472 --> 00:29:59,717
<i>We’ll do everything we can.</i>

287
00:30:00,427 --> 00:30:03,586
- So you’ll pay them?
- No. That we can’t do.

288
00:30:03,764 --> 00:30:04,657
Wait... What?

289
00:30:04,874 --> 00:30:05,843
<i>It’s the policy of the United
States government...</i>

290
00:30:06,044 --> 00:30:09,271
- That's bullshit... come on!
- to not negotiate with terrorists.

291
00:30:09,272 --> 00:30:11,657
you’re sitting in an air
conditioned office somewhere.

292
00:30:11,658 --> 00:30:13,958
It's easy for you to say...
You’re not the one stuck in a coffin...

293
00:30:13,959 --> 00:30:17,543
- buried in the God damn desert!
- I understand your frustration...

294
00:30:17,707 --> 00:30:21,686
Frustration? Lady, I’m going to
fucking die in here. Understand that!

295
00:30:28,922 --> 00:30:30,296
- Hello?
- I’m here.

296
00:30:30,511 --> 00:30:32,796
Well, then say something. Tell me
how you’re going to get me out of here.

297
00:30:32,831 --> 00:30:35,879
What’s the number on
the phone you’re calling from?

298
00:30:36,004 --> 00:30:37,288
I don’t know.
Did it come up on your end?

299
00:30:37,701 --> 00:30:38,772
No. It’s listed as unavailable.

300
00:30:38,798 --> 00:30:42,020
- Can you remember a number?
- Yeah... No!

301
00:30:42,212 --> 00:30:43,927
- I have a pencil.
- Okay, write this down.

302
00:30:45,407 --> 00:30:48,619
Just a second... Go ahead.

303
00:30:48,891 --> 00:30:50,061
- 410.
- Yeah.

304
00:30:50,326 --> 00:30:51,574
- 195.
- Yeah.

305
00:30:52,158 --> 00:30:54,339
- 5453.
- 5453.

306
00:30:54,587 --> 00:30:56,049
- Who’s that?
- Dan Brenner.

307
00:30:56,194 --> 00:31:00,490
<i>He’s the commander of a Hostage
Working Group over in Iraq.</i>

308
00:31:00,907 --> 00:31:02,492
Hostage Working Group?

309
00:31:02,617 --> 00:31:06,496
<i>We formed it in 2003 to deal with
situations such as yours.</i>

310
00:31:06,621 --> 00:31:09,458
Situations.
I love how you keep calling it that.

311
00:31:09,583 --> 00:31:11,168
- Did you write down the number?
- Yeah.

312
00:31:11,293 --> 00:31:13,450
Good. Hold on, I’ll connect you
with him now. He should be expecting you.

313
00:31:13,725 --> 00:31:16,283
- What about the news? I’m going to call them.
- No. Do not contact the news.

314
00:31:16,696 --> 00:31:17,873
I repeat, do not
contact the news.

315
00:31:18,413 --> 00:31:21,868
It will only complicate things further
and threaten your chances of rescue.

316
00:31:21,869 --> 00:31:23,603
You don’t go looking for something
if you don’t know it’s missing.

317
00:31:24,951 --> 00:31:26,725
We are running
out of time, Paul.

318
00:31:27,226 --> 00:31:29,891
That’s why you need to contact Dan
Brenner right away.

319
00:31:31,173 --> 00:31:31,874
Fine.

320
00:31:33,105 --> 00:31:34,403
I’m transferring you now.

321
00:31:55,304 --> 00:31:57,457
- Brenner.
- Dan Brenner?

322
00:31:57,583 --> 00:32:00,085
- Is this Paul Conroy?
- Yes, yes it’s me.

323
00:32:00,210 --> 00:32:01,581
Paul, I was informed
of what’s going on.

324
00:32:01,582 --> 00:32:04,582
I want you to know that we’re already
working on trying to get you out of there.

325
00:32:04,696 --> 00:32:05,530
Oh, thank you, God.

326
00:32:05,784 --> 00:32:08,326
I was told that we have until 9pm.
Is that right?

327
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:09,431
- That’s what he said.
- Alright.

328
00:32:09,432 --> 00:32:12,055
That doesn’t give us a
whole lot of time.

329
00:32:12,056 --> 00:32:14,233
And just so I have this right,
the kidnappers buried you in the ground?

330
00:32:14,655 --> 00:32:15,697
Yeah, in an old, wooden coffin.

331
00:32:15,698 --> 00:32:18,529
Okay. My guess is that since
you’re able to get a cell signal...

332
00:32:18,530 --> 00:32:20,430
you’re no more than a few feet
underground.

333
00:32:20,569 --> 00:32:21,470
I don’t know. Maybe.

334
00:32:22,025 --> 00:32:23,646
What about battery life?
How much does the phone have left?

335
00:32:23,647 --> 00:32:27,070
Less than half.

336
00:32:27,071 --> 00:32:28,043
Okay. You have to conserve
that battery.

337
00:32:28,656 --> 00:32:30,989
Our best bet of finding
you is by tracking your cell signal.

338
00:32:31,827 --> 00:32:34,955
- Is the ringer set on a sound or vibrate?
- Vibrate.

339
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:38,751
Press and hold down the asterisk
key to change it to a ring tone.

340
00:32:38,876 --> 00:32:40,233
- It will use less power.
- What about my Zippo?

341
00:32:41,399 --> 00:32:42,389
- You have a lighter?
- Yeah.

342
00:32:42,714 --> 00:32:45,926
- Use it to look around for markings, a logo...
- Won’t it use up oxygen?

343
00:32:46,051 --> 00:32:49,180
- Don’t worry about that now. Try to find...
- It’s really dark in here without it.

344
00:32:49,230 --> 00:32:50,017
I understand, Paul.

345
00:32:50,018 --> 00:32:54,018
Try to find anything in there that might
indicate where that coffin was made.

346
00:32:54,142 --> 00:32:57,562
- You guys have to hurry.
- We’re working as fast as we can, Paul.

347
00:32:57,687 --> 00:32:59,615
- Do you know if there were any other survivors?
- From your convoy?

348
00:33:00,026 --> 00:33:02,245
- Yeah.
- That’s still unclear at this point.

349
00:33:04,653 --> 00:33:06,023
I just wanted to do right by my
family. That’s all.

350
00:33:06,024 --> 00:33:09,024
I didn’t know it was going to be
like this over here.

351
00:33:09,099 --> 00:33:10,498
I don’t think any of us did.

352
00:33:14,872 --> 00:33:15,656
It’s him. He’s calling.

353
00:33:15,930 --> 00:33:17,045
- The kidnapper?
- Yeah. What do I do?

354
00:33:17,402 --> 00:33:18,294
- You know his number?
- Yeah.

355
00:33:18,685 --> 00:33:20,070
- Give it to me.
- What about the call?

356
00:33:20,177 --> 00:33:21,126
- Give me the number first.
- He’s going to hang up.

357
00:33:21,457 --> 00:33:23,654
- Take the call... Just take the call.
- But... OK

358
00:33:25,327 --> 00:33:26,578
Hello.

359
00:33:27,546 --> 00:33:28,780
Two hour, four minute.

360
00:33:31,656 --> 00:33:35,159
- You have to give me more time.
- You talk to embassy? They give money?

361
00:33:35,284 --> 00:33:37,715
Yes. No. I talked to... someone. Government.
They said that they won’t pay the money.

362
00:33:38,047 --> 00:33:38,819
No pay?

363
00:33:39,122 --> 00:33:40,959
No. They said that they don’t
negotiate with terrorists.

364
00:33:41,501 --> 00:33:46,214
- Terrorists? I am terrorist?
- Yes. You are terrorist, you son of a bitch.

365
00:33:46,339 --> 00:33:51,678
- You are terrified, so I am terrorist?
- What did I ever do to you?

366
00:33:51,803 --> 00:33:54,431
- Ever do?
- Yeah.

367
00:33:56,808 --> 00:33:59,936
I’m here because it’s a job,
to make money. That’s it.

368
00:34:00,061 --> 00:34:03,190
I have job until you come.
Now, my family have nothing.

369
00:34:03,191 --> 00:34:04,191
That’s not my fault!

370
00:34:04,315 --> 00:34:06,487
Nine, one, one was not my fault,
but still you are here!

371
00:34:06,488 --> 00:34:09,111
Saddam was not my fault,
but still you are here!

372
00:34:09,112 --> 00:34:11,002
I told you, I’m only here to work.
To help rebuild.

373
00:34:11,003 --> 00:34:13,267
Rebuild what you destroyed.

374
00:34:13,302 --> 00:34:15,243
Stop! Just please, stop!
I’m just a guy.

375
00:34:15,368 --> 00:34:16,959
I’m just a truck driver.
Okay?

376
00:34:17,237 --> 00:34:19,664
I’m nobody that makes decisions about
anything. I just want to go home.

377
00:34:25,819 --> 00:34:26,544
Hello?

378
00:34:28,306 --> 00:34:30,369
You make video, ransom video.

379
00:34:30,404 --> 00:34:32,787
Yeah. If you let me go,
I’ll make the video.

380
00:34:32,836 --> 00:34:34,294
No. You make video now.

381
00:34:34,788 --> 00:34:36,459
- What...? How?
- You use video on phone.

382
00:34:37,819 --> 00:34:40,486
Near foot. You read note
near foot in box.

383
00:34:42,872 --> 00:34:46,417
- Where? I don’t see...
- Near foot. Read note inside box.

384
00:34:46,542 --> 00:34:48,611
Okay, okay...
If I make it, will you let me go?

385
00:34:49,076 --> 00:34:50,808
Only if we get money.

386
00:34:51,714 --> 00:34:53,334
Nobody’s going to pay five million
dollars for me.

387
00:34:53,335 --> 00:34:56,496
We take less.
One million money.

388
00:34:56,620 --> 00:34:58,261
If they pay it, will you let me go?

389
00:35:00,056 --> 00:35:03,268
One million money.

390
00:39:00,641 --> 00:39:02,272
<i>Thanks for calling the Conroy’s.</i>

391
00:39:02,273 --> 00:39:06,273
<i>We’re not home right now. Please
leave a message at the beep. Thanks.</i>

392
00:39:12,236 --> 00:39:13,696
Shit.

393
00:39:24,549 --> 00:39:25,361
Paul?

394
00:39:25,396 --> 00:39:27,732
- Here’s his number...
- Hold on. Alright, go ahead.

395
00:39:28,052 --> 00:39:29,459
Okay. Alright...

396
00:39:31,331 --> 00:39:35,877
It’s 07902-24-921.

397
00:39:35,878 --> 00:39:37,587
Okay.
This is huge, Paul.

398
00:39:37,713 --> 00:39:39,271
Unless they’re using
a cloned line...

399
00:39:39,539 --> 00:39:41,736
we should be able to find where
this is coming from in minutes.

400
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:45,278
- What about me? Can you track my cell signal?
- We’re having a lot of trouble with yours.

401
00:39:45,338 --> 00:39:48,683
Seems to be an EDS line, probably
through one of the Egyptian carriers.

402
00:39:49,183 --> 00:39:53,771
- What does that mean?
- That... it’s not going to be easy.

403
00:39:53,896 --> 00:39:57,496
- He wants me to make a ransom video.
- No. Hold off for as long as you can.

404
00:39:57,531 --> 00:39:59,399
If it’s going to get me out of
here, I’m making it.

405
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:02,345
The last thing we want is for this
to end up all over Al Jazeera.

406
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:05,221
- We? - This can’t turn into an
international incident.

407
00:40:05,256 --> 00:40:07,280
That’s all you people care about!
Don’t you care about me?

408
00:40:07,281 --> 00:40:08,357
- We do.
- What about me?

409
00:40:08,358 --> 00:40:11,365
We do, Paul, We do.
That's why we're here...

410
00:40:11,366 --> 00:40:13,446
No you don’t!
You don't care about me.

411
00:40:13,547 --> 00:40:14,479
You don’t
care about any of us.

412
00:40:14,737 --> 00:40:16,706
I’ve had eight friends killed
out here, six of them today.

413
00:40:16,707 --> 00:40:18,857
Listen to me...

414
00:40:18,864 --> 00:40:21,416
We don’t have any
guns, any armor. Nothing.

415
00:40:21,541 --> 00:40:22,382
You’re not soldiers.

416
00:40:22,383 --> 00:40:24,215
Tell that to the people who
put me in this box!

417
00:40:24,250 --> 00:40:26,706
- Paul, listen. - Tell that to the
people who shot my friends!

418
00:40:26,998 --> 00:40:30,350
- We’re doing the best we can.
- No, you’re not. No!

419
00:40:30,359 --> 00:40:31,277
Okay, calm down.

420
00:40:31,402 --> 00:40:35,411
All you care about is your
secret plans and your back room politics.

421
00:40:35,446 --> 00:40:37,715
If I were some diplomat or a hostage
working group leader...

422
00:40:37,716 --> 00:40:39,795
or whatever your fack title is,
I’d be out of here by now.

423
00:40:39,796 --> 00:40:43,098
But I’m not, so I’m just supposed
to keep my mouth shut and die.

424
00:40:43,133 --> 00:40:46,418
- I need you to stay focused, Paul.
- Fuck you.

425
00:40:46,543 --> 00:40:50,463
Paul, listen to me, finding you is
our primary concern. Bottom line.

426
00:40:50,589 --> 00:40:53,925
And we’re searching just as hard as
we would be for a four-star general...

427
00:40:54,050 --> 00:40:56,887
So don’t literally waste
your breath suggesting otherwise.

428
00:40:58,889 --> 00:41:00,176
Are you injured, Paul?
Are you okay?

429
00:41:00,570 --> 00:41:03,505
Who are they?
The people who put me here?

430
00:41:04,269 --> 00:41:07,015
They’re just that, people.
No different from you and me.

431
00:41:07,181 --> 00:41:09,850
- I’m no terrorist.
- Neither are they.

432
00:41:09,975 --> 00:41:11,435
How do you know that?

433
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:13,746
If you were homeless,
starving...

434
00:41:14,030 --> 00:41:16,880
Actually, I take that back.
If your family was homeless and starving...

435
00:41:17,316 --> 00:41:20,069
- What would you do for them?
- I wouldn’t kill someone.

436
00:41:20,194 --> 00:41:24,281
- How can you be sure?
- What difference does it make?

437
00:41:24,407 --> 00:41:25,635
They’re criminals,
desperate ones at that.

438
00:41:25,636 --> 00:41:29,234
They don’t care about
anything other than getting the money.

439
00:41:29,235 --> 00:41:30,632
So pay them, just pay them.

440
00:41:30,906 --> 00:41:34,826
Trust me, if it was an option, I
would do that in a heartbeat.

441
00:41:37,537 --> 00:41:38,496
How many others
have there been?

442
00:41:38,789 --> 00:41:41,292
- Since I got here?
- Yeah.

443
00:41:41,417 --> 00:41:44,754
Several. Journalists, contractors, soldiers...
hundreds have been taken.

444
00:41:44,879 --> 00:41:47,590
It’s one of the only
functioning businesses out here.

445
00:41:48,132 --> 00:41:51,052
How many have you rescued?

446
00:41:54,889 --> 00:41:57,558
- How many?
- Not many.

447
00:41:57,683 --> 00:42:00,227
- Tell me their names.
- No.

448
00:42:01,103 --> 00:42:03,814
- Give me a name.
- Who?

449
00:42:03,940 --> 00:42:08,819
Any of them. Make me know they
really do matter to you.

450
00:42:09,445 --> 00:42:11,635
- Mark White.
- Who was Mark White?

451
00:42:12,199 --> 00:42:17,287
A kid from New Hampshire.
Twenty-six years old. Med student.

452
00:42:17,412 --> 00:42:20,249
Came over here to help
out local doctors.

453
00:42:20,374 --> 00:42:24,378
- What happened to him?
- Insurgents grabbed him.

454
00:42:24,503 --> 00:42:27,923
- When?
- About three weeks ago.

455
00:42:31,635 --> 00:42:34,096
You remember his name.

456
00:42:34,221 --> 00:42:36,640
I remember all their names.

457
00:42:38,284 --> 00:42:43,247
- Did he...? Is he...?
- Yes. Yes, he’s alive.

458
00:42:43,372 --> 00:42:44,665
- Where is he now?
- Home.

459
00:42:45,401 --> 00:42:47,323
Probably happy to
be back at school.

460
00:42:51,106 --> 00:42:52,983
I want to get out of here.

461
00:42:53,108 --> 00:42:57,112
We found him,
we’ll find you, too.

462
00:42:57,696 --> 00:42:58,822
How?

463
00:42:58,947 --> 00:43:01,908
We already have a solid lead on the
number you gave us.

464
00:43:02,033 --> 00:43:04,299
- You do?
- A unit’s on it’s way over there now.

465
00:43:06,036 --> 00:43:08,892
- That feel’s good.
- Yeah.

466
00:43:11,174 --> 00:43:14,121
What should I do
in the meantime?

467
00:43:14,338 --> 00:43:16,177
I know it’s hard,
but try to relax.

468
00:43:16,178 --> 00:43:18,877
The more worked up you are, the
more air you’re going to use.

469
00:43:20,094 --> 00:43:22,221
I can’t help it.

470
00:43:23,764 --> 00:43:28,092
I have anxiety.
I take pills for it.

471
00:43:28,093 --> 00:43:30,286
Do you have them with you?

472
00:43:30,287 --> 00:43:32,800
- Yeah.
- Good, take them.

473
00:43:33,842 --> 00:43:37,178
You need to preserve
your oxygen level any way you can.

474
00:43:38,638 --> 00:43:41,307
- Is your Zippo still lit.
- No. Not anymore.

475
00:43:41,433 --> 00:43:43,072
- Good.
- I feel nauseous.

476
00:43:43,309 --> 00:43:46,679
You have to calm down.
And you need to save that battery.

477
00:43:47,965 --> 00:43:52,428
<i>We’re expecting some intel in about
ten minutes. Call me back then.</i>

478
00:43:52,553 --> 00:43:56,140
- Just hang in there, Paul.
- Yeah. I’m trying.

479
00:44:02,923 --> 00:44:03,871
- What?
- Did you make video?

480
00:44:04,175 --> 00:44:05,159
- No.
- You make video!

481
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:07,290
- Let me out and I’ll make it.
- No! You make video now. In box.

482
00:44:07,590 --> 00:44:09,191
- I can’t read the paper.
- Make video now!

483
00:44:09,418 --> 00:44:11,112
I don’t know what you want me to say.
I can’t read the paper.

484
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:12,669
You make video now.

485
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:15,027
Fuck!

486
00:44:41,062 --> 00:44:42,814
Come on, Come on.

487
00:44:43,648 --> 00:44:47,069
Come on, Come on.
Come on, Come on.

488
00:47:31,790 --> 00:47:34,876
<i>Mountain View Nursing Home.</i>

489
00:47:35,001 --> 00:47:38,797
I was hoping I could speak with
Maryanne Conroy, please.

490
00:47:38,922 --> 00:47:42,352
Um... okay. Ah... let me bring the
cordless phone to her room.

491
00:47:42,885 --> 00:47:43,844
Hold on a moment, please.

492
00:47:52,729 --> 00:47:55,231
Misses Conroy,
you have a telephone call.

493
00:47:59,903 --> 00:48:04,616
- Hello?
- Mom... it’s Paul.

494
00:48:04,783 --> 00:48:08,328
- Who?
- It’s Paul. Your son.

495
00:48:09,329 --> 00:48:12,124
- My son?
- It’s okay, Mom.

496
00:48:12,291 --> 00:48:14,310
- How are you?
- I’m fine.

497
00:48:16,805 --> 00:48:20,871
- Who are you?
- It’s your son, Mom. It’s Paulie.

498
00:48:22,634 --> 00:48:25,429
- Paulie?
- Yeah.

499
00:48:25,763 --> 00:48:29,112
Remember? We lived over on
Colfax Street, in the duplex. Remember?

500
00:48:29,147 --> 00:48:30,978
- Paulie?
- Yeah.

501
00:48:32,354 --> 00:48:34,940
- That's right.
- Is this Paulie?

502
00:48:35,107 --> 00:48:38,194
It is, Mom. It’s Paulie.

503
00:48:39,612 --> 00:48:42,948
- How’s everything at the home?
- Very nice.

504
00:48:43,074 --> 00:48:47,370
Your father and I have
been playing gin rummy every night.

505
00:48:51,665 --> 00:48:54,502
Yeah... I don’t think Pop’s there
with you, Mom.

506
00:48:54,627 --> 00:48:59,256
- How are you doing, sweetie?
- Not very good.

507
00:49:03,094 --> 00:49:06,849
- This may be the last time I talk to you.
- That’s nice, honey.

508
00:49:09,962 --> 00:49:12,441
Did you get the flowers I sent a
few months ago?

509
00:49:13,204 --> 00:49:14,541
- Flowers?
- Yeah.

510
00:49:15,662 --> 00:49:18,107
I sent... never mind.

511
00:49:20,342 --> 00:49:21,590
Look,
I... I’m going to go now.

512
00:49:22,093 --> 00:49:26,942
I just wanted to talk to you,
I love you, Mom.

513
00:49:29,596 --> 00:49:32,138
I love you, Mom.
Did you hear me?

514
00:49:32,366 --> 00:49:36,265
Yes, dear. Your father and I have
been playing gin rummy every night.

515
00:49:40,283 --> 00:49:41,304
Okay, Mom.
Tell Pop I said hi.

516
00:50:28,941 --> 00:50:31,569
No, no, no!

517
00:50:33,434 --> 00:50:35,143
No, no, no!

518
00:50:38,275 --> 00:50:39,675
- Video make?
- Let her go. Please. Please don’t hurt her.

519
00:50:39,995 --> 00:50:41,147
We shoot her if you no make video.

520
00:50:41,425 --> 00:50:42,879
No! No, please no shoot.
No shoot her.

521
00:50:43,004 --> 00:50:45,967
- You get money. American million.
- I will, I promise.

522
00:50:46,284 --> 00:50:47,967
- Just don’t shoot her. She’s a mother, she’s
got two kids. - Two kids?

523
00:50:48,205 --> 00:50:50,676
- Yes. She has two kids.
- I have five. Now only one. You make video. Now!

524
00:50:50,677 --> 00:50:53,619
- Wait... I can’t read the paper.
- No wait! I give three seconds.

525
00:50:53,620 --> 00:50:54,452
- Three... Two...
- Okay!

526
00:50:54,453 --> 00:50:58,780
Okay, I’ll make the video.
Just, please, don’t shoot.

527
00:50:58,994 --> 00:51:01,089
I need to hang up to make the
video. Okay? Is that okay?

528
00:51:01,335 --> 00:51:03,353
You have three minute
to send video.

529
00:51:25,993 --> 00:51:29,997
My name is Paul Conroy. I’m an
American citizen from Hastings, Michigan.

530
00:51:30,123 --> 00:51:34,001
I’m a civilian truck
driver for Crestin, Roland and Thomas.

531
00:51:34,127 --> 00:51:37,505
I’ve been taken hostage
somewhere in Iraq...

532
00:51:37,630 --> 00:51:40,729
I need one million dollars by nine
o’clock tonight, Baghdad time.

533
00:51:41,050 --> 00:51:45,179
or else I’ll be left to die in
this coffin I’m buried in.

534
00:51:45,304 --> 00:51:47,974
I’ve been told that
if the money is paid...

535
00:51:49,292 --> 00:51:51,011
I’ve been told that
if the money is paid I will be let go.

536
00:51:51,012 --> 00:51:55,398
If it’s not,
I will be left to die in here.

537
00:51:56,858 --> 00:52:00,486
These threats are real and
will be followed through on.

538
00:59:00,685 --> 00:59:01,598
Oh, my...

539
00:59:08,431 --> 00:59:09,168
I got you!

540
00:59:26,828 --> 00:59:28,661
I got you.

541
00:59:40,509 --> 00:59:44,888
<i>Hi, this is Linda. Please leave a
message. Thanks and have a great day.</i>

542
00:59:45,013 --> 00:59:50,955
Linda, the number for the
phone. I got it.

543
00:59:51,704 --> 00:59:55,146
It’s 07902-42-884.

544
00:59:55,181 --> 00:59:58,020
You have to use the
international calling code, baby.

545
00:59:58,935 --> 01:00:01,078
Call me as soon as you get this.
I love you...

546
01:00:06,281 --> 01:00:07,017
Oh shit.

547
01:00:09,458 --> 01:00:10,479
Shit.

548
01:01:38,266 --> 01:01:39,408
<i>My name is Pamela Lutti.</i>

549
01:01:39,559 --> 01:01:45,214
<i>I’m a food service worker at F.O.B. Anaconda,
employed by Crestin, Roland and Thomas.</i>

550
01:01:50,520 --> 01:01:53,857
<i>My captor's requests for ransom
have gone unanswered, and -</i>

551
01:01:53,982 --> 01:01:55,316
<i>Please... no!</i>

552
01:02:14,753 --> 01:02:16,337
<i>Please... no!</i>

553
01:02:59,124 --> 01:03:00,522
<i>Thanks for calling the Conroy’s.</i>

554
01:03:00,523 --> 01:03:04,023
<i>We’re not home right now.
Please leave a message at the beep. Thanks.</i>

555
01:03:42,169 --> 01:03:45,672
- Why the hell did you make that video?
- It’s all a bunch of lies.

556
01:03:45,797 --> 01:03:48,842
- What is? What are you talking about?
- All of it.

557
01:03:48,967 --> 01:03:49,814
All of what?

558
01:03:49,901 --> 01:03:52,403
Nobody gives a shit about any of
us. We’re nothing to you people.

559
01:03:52,514 --> 01:03:56,768
- We’re going to find you.
- Fuck off. You babysitting me!

560
01:03:56,893 --> 01:03:59,187
You just gonna
stay with until i die.

561
01:03:59,312 --> 01:04:02,733
You can’t start breaking on me now,
Paul. You have to stay strong.

562
01:04:02,858 --> 01:04:05,621
They shot her...
and you didn't do anything.

563
01:04:05,622 --> 01:04:08,423
We didn’t even know she's
been taken hostage.

564
01:04:08,458 --> 01:04:11,450
- She sent three videos.
- That’s what they told her to say.

565
01:04:11,575 --> 01:04:13,702
- Why?
- I don’t know.

566
01:04:14,327 --> 01:04:15,704
What do you know?

567
01:04:17,122 --> 01:04:20,381
That your ransom video already has
47,000 hits on YouTube.

568
01:04:21,408 --> 01:04:24,402
And all the major networks are playing it,
including Al Jazeera.

569
01:04:25,451 --> 01:04:28,379
So, now your captors have
no choice but to follow through.

570
01:04:29,051 --> 01:04:31,345
I found out the number
to this phone.

571
01:04:32,180 --> 01:04:34,974
- How?
- Who cares?

572
01:04:35,099 --> 01:04:36,880
I figured that out, and
you didn’t. Why?

573
01:04:39,745 --> 01:04:41,448
Because I didn’t.

574
01:04:41,750 --> 01:04:43,435
Just like you and every other
person on this planet...

575
01:04:43,436 --> 01:04:46,436
there are some things I
know and some things I don’t.

576
01:04:49,072 --> 01:04:51,116
Then how are you going
to get me out of here?

577
01:04:51,241 --> 01:04:55,996
Their signal was cloned, like we figured.
But, we’re close. Really close.

578
01:04:58,081 --> 01:05:02,294
I’m near a Mosque. I could hear
the call to prayer over the P.A.

579
01:05:02,419 --> 01:05:05,315
Good. That means that
we’re in the right area.

580
01:05:07,831 --> 01:05:08,910
You’re nearby?

581
01:05:09,794 --> 01:05:14,549
I spoke with soldiers from the
third ID who were escorting your convoy.

582
01:05:14,674 --> 01:05:17,593
- They’re alive?
- Not all of them.

583
01:05:17,627 --> 01:05:20,532
Both Bradley
tanks were hit with IEDs.

584
01:05:20,533 --> 01:05:22,562
The rest got caught
in small arms fire.

585
01:05:24,384 --> 01:05:25,719
What the hell happened
out there, Paul?

586
01:05:27,577 --> 01:05:29,454
Paul.

587
01:05:30,612 --> 01:05:31,410
Paul?

588
01:06:15,101 --> 01:06:15,912
Fuck!

589
01:06:43,118 --> 01:06:45,448
Hello? Hello? Who’s there?

590
01:06:45,593 --> 01:06:48,847
- Is this Paul Conroy?
- Yes. Yes, this is Paul. Who are you?

591
01:06:48,972 --> 01:06:50,101
Paul, my name’s Alan Davenport.

592
01:06:50,102 --> 01:06:53,225
I’m the personnel director here at
Crestin, Roland and Thomas.

593
01:06:53,226 --> 01:06:54,142
I left you a message.

594
01:06:54,203 --> 01:06:57,498
You did. I also heard from Rebecca
Browning over at the State Department.

595
01:06:57,623 --> 01:07:00,626
- Are you able to speak
on the status of your situation? - It’s worse.

596
01:07:00,751 --> 01:07:03,702
There was an explosion or something.
there’s sand is coming through.

597
01:07:03,703 --> 01:07:05,951
I only have a
half an hour before -

598
01:07:05,957 --> 01:07:08,126
Okay, okay. Slow down.
You should try to stay calm.

599
01:07:08,251 --> 01:07:10,045
Tell me something, Paul,
who have you spoken to?

600
01:07:10,170 --> 01:07:14,049
The hostage takers, Dan Brenner
from the hostage working group...

601
01:07:14,174 --> 01:07:16,770
Okay, Paul. I’m with you.
How about the media.

602
01:07:16,771 --> 01:07:18,594
I know your ransom video leaked...

603
01:07:18,595 --> 01:07:19,439
- But have you spoken...
- No.

604
01:07:19,440 --> 01:07:20,440
- Directly to anyone about what’s going on?
- No, no, no.

605
01:07:21,264 --> 01:07:23,808
That’s good.
It needs to stay that way.

606
01:07:23,933 --> 01:07:27,312
It’s important that we keep
this situation as contained as possible.

607
01:07:27,437 --> 01:07:30,648
Three inches to five...
I think it's pretty contained.

608
01:07:30,774 --> 01:07:33,619
Help me! Help me! What are you
doing right now to help me?!

609
01:07:33,620 --> 01:07:34,869
I know you’re upset.

610
01:07:34,870 --> 01:07:38,803
And, from what I’ve been told,
steps are being taken to get you out of there.

611
01:07:38,804 --> 01:07:42,577
So, hopefully it won’t be
much longer.

612
01:07:42,702 --> 01:07:44,579
Thank God.

613
01:07:46,247 --> 01:07:50,465
I’m going to switch on a recorder
right now. Just a second...

614
01:07:53,965 --> 01:07:59,846
This is Alan Davenport, Personnel Director for
Crestin, Roland and Thomas, Incorporated.

615
01:07:59,971 --> 01:08:02,724
The date is
October 23, 2006.

616
01:08:02,849 --> 01:08:05,686
I am speaking
with Paul Conroy.

617
01:08:05,811 --> 01:08:09,648
Mister Conroy, are you aware that
I’m recording this conversation?

618
01:08:09,649 --> 01:08:09,738
What...?

619
01:08:09,773 --> 01:08:13,527
- Please answer the question.
- Shit.

620
01:08:13,652 --> 01:08:14,861
- Mister Conroy?
- Yeah, yeah!

621
01:08:14,986 --> 01:08:19,908
- And do I have your permission to do so?
- Why do you need my permission? What is about?

622
01:08:20,033 --> 01:08:22,433
- I need you to answer yes or no, please.
- Yes. Yes! Alright?

623
01:08:22,520 --> 01:08:26,233
Thank you. Now, Mister Conroy,
when were you hired by CRT?

624
01:08:26,234 --> 01:08:29,420
About nine months ago. Around
January. What is all this?

625
01:08:29,501 --> 01:08:32,815
I have your official date of hire
as January 4th. Is that correct?

626
01:08:33,866 --> 01:08:35,627
Who cares?
This is fucking crazy...

627
01:08:36,037 --> 01:08:38,059
- January 4th. Is that correct?
- Yes!

628
01:08:38,353 --> 01:08:41,621
And during your initial training,
before being sent to Iraq...

629
01:08:41,939 --> 01:08:45,949
Were you made aware of the dangers inherent
to the position for which you were hired.

630
01:08:45,984 --> 01:08:47,729
You mean when I came
down there to Dallas.

631
01:08:47,730 --> 01:08:50,592
and you guys said that all of the trucks would
be armored and have bulletproof glass?

632
01:08:51,116 --> 01:08:53,827
You mean when you told us that
things were safer than ever over here?

633
01:08:53,952 --> 01:08:55,620
Is that when I was made aware?

634
01:08:55,746 --> 01:09:00,042
I need you to answer yes or no,
please. - Yes.

635
01:09:00,167 --> 01:09:04,311
During that time, did you also receive and
sign an employment contract with CRT...

636
01:09:04,312 --> 01:09:08,582
which thoroughly explained company policy
to protect your specific terms of employment?

637
01:09:08,785 --> 01:09:10,563
Yeah, I signed a bunch of things.

638
01:09:11,261 --> 01:09:14,931
- Yes or no.
- Yes. I signed the contract. Yes!

639
01:09:15,057 --> 01:09:17,853
It’s our understanding that you
were taken hostage in Iraq two hours ago.

640
01:09:17,854 --> 01:09:18,433
Is that also correct?

641
01:09:18,434 --> 01:09:22,189
Yes. I think it's a fair assessment
of the situation, you fucking dick!

642
01:09:22,190 --> 01:09:23,342
What is the point of all this?

643
01:09:23,377 --> 01:09:27,612
Our legal department requires that
we obtain a sworn affidavit from employees...

644
01:09:27,737 --> 01:09:32,701
confirming that they understand the reasons
for their forced separation from the company.

645
01:09:32,826 --> 01:09:36,496
As of this morning, your employment
with CRT was officially terminated.

646
01:09:36,621 --> 01:09:38,999
Wait, wait, wait... what?

647
01:09:39,124 --> 01:09:41,043
It was brought to our attention
that you were engaging in relations...

648
01:09:41,044 --> 01:09:44,485
with a fellow CRT employee,
Pamela Lutti.

649
01:09:45,584 --> 01:09:46,808
No. Wait...

650
01:09:46,830 --> 01:09:50,817
Stipulated in your contract was a fraternization
clause, in which it was stated quite clearly

651
01:09:50,927 --> 01:09:54,742
that any relationship, be it romantic or
sexual in nature

652
01:09:54,743 --> 01:09:58,276
deemed inappropriate
by CRT senior officials

653
01:09:58,311 --> 01:10:02,839
- is grounds for immediate termination.
- We... we were just friends.

654
01:10:03,109 --> 01:10:04,831
- Our records indicate differently.
- You records are wrongs.

655
01:10:05,656 --> 01:10:08,034
We’re also legally required to
inform you that...

656
01:10:08,047 --> 01:10:09,256
because you were
technically no longer under

657
01:10:09,257 --> 01:10:12,623
the employ of CRT at
the time of your abduction...

658
01:10:12,624 --> 01:10:15,575
we cannot be held accountable
for any injury that may befall upon you...

659
01:10:15,839 --> 01:10:19,521
after your official
date and time of termination.

660
01:10:20,100 --> 01:10:23,008
Therefore, in your case, that
includes this incident

661
01:10:23,009 --> 01:10:25,700
or any consequences
that may result from it.

662
01:10:27,435 --> 01:10:30,668
What about my insurance money? My
family will need that money...

663
01:10:31,150 --> 01:10:33,832
Given that you were alive up until
the time of your termination...

664
01:10:34,571 --> 01:10:35,416
Don’t do this.

665
01:10:37,155 --> 01:10:39,147
- Do you understand everything...
- Don’t do this!

666
01:10:39,400 --> 01:10:42,304
Do you understand everything
you’ve been told, Mister Conroy?

667
01:10:45,903 --> 01:10:48,113
Mister Conroy?

668
01:10:49,073 --> 01:10:51,367
You're piece of shit!

669
01:10:51,702 --> 01:10:54,961
That concludes our interview
with Paul Conroy.

670
01:10:54,962 --> 01:10:57,229
I am now turning off
the recorder.

671
01:11:00,251 --> 01:11:02,670
You put me here.

672
01:11:06,257 --> 01:11:08,259
I’m sorry.

673
01:13:53,969 --> 01:13:54,699
Fuck!

674
01:14:35,430 --> 01:14:37,552
- Paul, is that you?
- They’re dead.

675
01:14:38,386 --> 01:14:41,431
- How do you know that?
- I just do.

676
01:14:41,556 --> 01:14:44,109
Three F-16s levelled parts of the
city a few minutes ago.

677
01:14:44,110 --> 01:14:48,023
Yeah! I know.
I felt it was for me.

678
01:14:52,484 --> 01:14:53,419
Did they know
I was here?

679
01:14:55,151 --> 01:14:56,668
Yeah.

680
01:14:57,740 --> 01:14:59,909
Did they care?

681
01:15:04,622 --> 01:15:08,502
These people that took me...
if they’re dead...

682
01:15:09,840 --> 01:15:11,271
they can’t tell you
where I am.

683
01:15:12,237 --> 01:15:14,247
We can still try to track
down your signal.

684
01:15:15,543 --> 01:15:19,797
- You tried that already.
- We can try again.

685
01:15:27,721 --> 01:15:30,933
- It’s over, isn’t it?
- No.

686
01:15:34,186 --> 01:15:36,272
Yeah.

687
01:15:40,902 --> 01:15:43,071
What should I do?

688
01:15:44,989 --> 01:15:47,033
I don’t know.

689
01:15:47,951 --> 01:15:52,163
- You heard?
- What is?

690
01:15:52,956 --> 01:15:54,589
Know.

691
01:15:57,628 --> 01:15:59,589
I wish this could have gone
differently, Paul.

692
01:16:01,885 --> 01:16:03,663
Yeah... me too.

693
01:16:05,725 --> 01:16:06,725
Me too.

694
01:16:22,943 --> 01:16:27,875
My name is Paul Steven Conroy.

695
01:16:28,793 --> 01:16:35,091
Social Security number 048-32-1198.
date of birth 3/20/76.

696
01:16:37,218 --> 01:16:41,472
This video will
serve as my last will and testament.

697
01:16:46,811 --> 01:16:48,523
To my wife, Linda Conroy...

698
01:16:48,524 --> 01:16:51,885
I leave the seven hundred
dollars in my personal savings.

699
01:16:55,487 --> 01:16:57,281
And whatever
I have left in my annuity.

700
01:16:59,408 --> 01:17:02,503
To my son, Shane Conroy...

701
01:17:07,022 --> 01:17:10,327
I don’t have...

702
01:17:11,924 --> 01:17:17,702
My clothes... I leave you my clothes.
Which you will grow into.

703
01:17:19,523 --> 01:17:20,301
Not this ones.

704
01:17:25,035 --> 01:17:26,010
It's all I have...

705
01:17:27,435 --> 01:17:30,630
I wish I had more... for you.

706
01:17:32,726 --> 01:17:36,871
Maybe if I was a famous baseball
player, or a guy who wore a suit to work...

707
01:17:39,016 --> 01:17:41,352
I would have more to leave you.

708
01:17:41,477 --> 01:17:43,753
But, you can be one of those
people if you want.

709
01:17:46,980 --> 01:17:49,009
Yeah.

710
01:17:50,219 --> 01:17:52,878
Just promise me that when you get older,
you’ll take good care of your mom.

711
01:17:54,407 --> 01:17:57,076
And... I don't know...

712
01:17:58,244 --> 01:17:59,860
That you’ll always try
to do the right thing.

713
01:18:04,126 --> 01:18:06,670
I love you very much, Shane.

714
01:18:09,047 --> 01:18:11,633
Maybe I never said that
enough...

715
01:18:11,850 --> 01:18:13,282
Maybe I did,
I don’t even know.

716
01:18:14,186 --> 01:18:15,587
That probably means I didn’t.

717
01:18:23,780 --> 01:18:28,994
I’m sorry, Linda.
I should have listened to you.

718
01:19:32,685 --> 01:19:33,508
You’re not dead.

719
01:19:34,327 --> 01:19:35,672
Hello? Hello?!

720
01:19:36,105 --> 01:19:38,941
- Where is money?
- I don’t know.

721
01:19:39,066 --> 01:19:40,548
- What don’t know?
- I don’t know where it is.

722
01:19:40,769 --> 01:19:42,699
- Liar!
- I’m not lying! I swear.

723
01:19:42,700 --> 01:19:45,735
- Swear?
- I swear. I’m telling the truth.

724
01:19:45,736 --> 01:19:47,046
- From Embassy
- I can’t!

725
01:19:47,047 --> 01:19:48,259
- You get money now!
- I can’t!

726
01:19:48,495 --> 01:19:49,973
- You will!
- I need more time. Please.

727
01:19:49,974 --> 01:19:50,879
No more time!

728
01:19:50,914 --> 01:19:53,750
There’s sand pouring in here.
It’s everywhere. Let me out of here.

729
01:19:53,876 --> 01:19:56,208
- I will get you the money.
- You show blood.

730
01:19:56,683 --> 01:19:58,829
- What?
- You show blood, they give money.

731
01:19:59,968 --> 01:20:03,444
- You cut finger, send video.
- I’m not doing that.

732
01:20:03,688 --> 01:20:04,756
- No?
- No.

733
01:20:04,803 --> 01:20:05,504
That’s right, no.

734
01:20:05,586 --> 01:20:08,533
You let me out of here, and I’ll cut
off my whole God damn hand if you want.

735
01:20:08,830 --> 01:20:09,653
You have wife?

736
01:20:09,788 --> 01:20:12,836
Yes, I do. And a son. A young son.
I want to see them. Please, sir.

737
01:20:12,871 --> 01:20:15,417
- Sir? - Yes. Sir. I say that
out of respect... to you.

738
01:20:15,919 --> 01:20:20,088
243 East Walnut Street.
Hastings, Michigan. U.S.A.

739
01:20:20,089 --> 01:20:25,590
- That’s my... why did you say that?
- You show blood... or they show blood.

740
01:20:26,409 --> 01:20:27,137
No.

741
01:20:27,822 --> 01:20:30,425
That’s... you’re lying.
You can’t get to them.

742
01:20:30,839 --> 01:20:31,667
- No?
- No.

743
01:20:31,908 --> 01:20:33,583
No. You’re peasants,
you're fucking criminals, that’s all.

744
01:20:33,892 --> 01:20:34,809
You don’t even know
where Michigan is.

745
01:20:35,334 --> 01:20:37,252
Detroit. Ann Arbor.

746
01:20:37,377 --> 01:20:40,162
You looked at a map.
You looked at a map.

747
01:20:40,601 --> 01:20:42,044
You show blood, or they show blood.

748
01:20:42,897 --> 01:20:44,066
Send video by five minutes.

749
01:20:58,174 --> 01:21:01,251
<i>Hi, this is Linda. Please leave a
message. Thanks and have a great day.</i>

750
01:21:01,436 --> 01:21:05,065
Linda, listen to me, you and Shane
have to go somewhere... Okay?

751
01:21:05,190 --> 01:21:07,692
Do not go back to the house.
Do not go back to the house.

752
01:21:07,817 --> 01:21:11,574
...he knows where you live.
He stole my license.

753
01:21:11,575 --> 01:21:13,807
Go to the Sheriff's station if you
have to, just don’t go home.

754
01:21:27,289 --> 01:21:30,409
<i>This is Daniel Brenner. Please
leave a message at the tone.</i>

755
01:21:30,899 --> 01:21:32,563
Brenner, where are you?!
The guy is still alive!

756
01:21:33,188 --> 01:21:35,026
He just called me!
He's still alive!

757
01:21:39,875 --> 01:21:44,103
They can’t find them.
They... can’t. There’s no way.

758
01:21:45,206 --> 01:21:46,976
No, no, no, no,

759
01:22:03,059 --> 01:22:03,981
<i>My name is Pamela Lutti.</i>

760
01:22:05,443 --> 01:22:11,021
<i>I’m a food service worker at F.O.B. Anaconda,
employed by Crestin, Roland and Thomas.</i>

761
01:22:13,619 --> 01:22:15,676
<i>My captor's requests for ransom
have gone unanswered, and...</i>

762
01:22:16,218 --> 01:22:17,095
<i>Please... no!</i>

763
01:24:01,974 --> 01:24:04,047
Paul.
Are you okay?

764
01:24:22,336 --> 01:24:24,063
- Yeah?
- Paul, it’s Brenner.

765
01:24:25,222 --> 01:24:28,141
- Are you there, Paul?
- I’m... here.

766
01:24:28,229 --> 01:24:30,766
We’re coming for you now. You hear
me? We know where you are.

767
01:24:31,297 --> 01:24:33,595
- You’re coming?
- We are, Paul. We’re almost there now.

768
01:24:34,122 --> 01:24:34,832
How do you know?

769
01:24:35,099 --> 01:24:37,783
Coalition forces picked up a Shiite
insurgent just outside of Baghdad.

770
01:24:38,102 --> 01:24:40,351
Said he knew where an
American was buried alive.

771
01:24:40,748 --> 01:24:41,970
He agreed to show us
where if we let him go.

772
01:24:42,521 --> 01:24:44,627
- You’re coming for me?
- We’re practically there already.

773
01:24:44,941 --> 01:24:46,363
- You have to hurry.
- We are, Paul.

774
01:24:46,780 --> 01:24:48,417
The sand...

775
01:24:48,782 --> 01:24:50,436
Just hang in there for
three more minutes.

776
01:24:50,437 --> 01:24:52,413
This will all be over
soon, I promise.

777
01:24:52,538 --> 01:24:54,698
- Okay. I believe you.
- Three minutes. Try to...

778
01:24:54,699 --> 01:24:56,857
- Hang in there for three more minutes.
- Thank you.

779
01:24:57,185 --> 01:24:58,537
- Thank you.
- This will all be over soon, I promise.

780
01:24:58,632 --> 01:25:00,413
I have to go!
Call me right back.

781
01:25:01,268 --> 01:25:03,028
Call me right back. Please!

782
01:25:04,689 --> 01:25:08,355
- Linda? Linda!
- Paul? Paul is that you?

783
01:25:09,419 --> 01:25:11,146
- Tell me it’s you.
- It’s me, sweetie.

784
01:25:11,573 --> 01:25:14,790
Oh my God, Paul! What are they doing to you?
Please tell me you’re okay.

785
01:25:15,909 --> 01:25:18,166
I just saw the news...

786
01:25:18,388 --> 01:25:21,642
That’s okay. It’s all okay.
They’re getting me out.

787
01:25:21,956 --> 01:25:23,406
- They are?
- It's gonna be okay.

788
01:25:23,592 --> 01:25:26,924
- Oh thank God. Oh dear God.
- They are on their way.

789
01:25:27,346 --> 01:25:30,399
- It’s all going to be okay.
- I was so afraid I was going to lose you.

790
01:25:30,974 --> 01:25:33,359
I love you so much.
I love you so, so much.

791
01:25:33,383 --> 01:25:37,693
I love you so much. I’m sorry.
I should have listened to you.

792
01:25:38,531 --> 01:25:42,010
Sweetie, I don’t care. I just want
you home. Please come home to me.

793
01:25:42,470 --> 01:25:43,504
I will.

794
01:25:44,236 --> 01:25:46,230
- Swear it.
- I swear. I swear I will.

795
01:25:47,051 --> 01:25:48,116
- I love you. I love you so much.
- I know.

796
01:25:49,773 --> 01:25:51,076
- They’re here!
- Okay.

797
01:25:51,649 --> 01:25:53,528
I have to go.

798
01:25:53,588 --> 01:25:55,322
- Call me right away.
- I will...

799
01:25:55,790 --> 01:25:58,358
- I love you.
- I love you.

800
01:25:58,406 --> 01:26:00,092
- Swear it again.
- I swear. I have to go.

801
01:26:00,440 --> 01:26:01,338
Come home to me.

802
01:26:02,393 --> 01:26:03,901
Move! Move! Let’s go.

803
01:26:03,902 --> 01:26:04,902
Paul? Paul?

804
01:26:05,380 --> 01:26:07,494
Corporal, get your men over here!

805
01:26:09,137 --> 01:26:11,149
You have to hurry.
It’s almost full.

806
01:26:11,271 --> 01:26:12,964
Just hang in there!

807
01:26:13,218 --> 01:26:16,612
- I can’t... Are you close?
- We’re almost there.

808
01:26:18,125 --> 01:26:20,223
I can’t hear you! Where are you?

809
01:26:26,635 --> 01:26:27,787
Please open it.
Please open it.

810
01:26:29,970 --> 01:26:31,197
