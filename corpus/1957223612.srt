Frankie. Excuse me.

Hi. How are you?

22
00:01:53,648 --> 00:01:56,450
I couldn't help but notice
that you touched your hair

23
00:01:56,483 --> 00:01:58,720
and then you touched the glass
right afterwards.

24
00:01:58,753 --> 00:02:02,924
This isn't a fucking barn and
it's also not rocket surgery.

- Rocket surgery?

- Come clean.

No, I'm...

57

You were in the frame,
but I was filming the...

58
00:03:35,183 --> 00:03:36,651
There's all these people
and there's this painting

59
00:03:36,684 --> 00:03:37,952

Thank you.

66
00:03:54,202 --> 00:03:55,570
All right,
you gotta hold my cheese

67
00:03:55,603 --> 00:03:56,938
and you gotta take care
of my head.

68
00:03:58,238 --> 00:03:59,841
All right, ladies and gentlemen.

69
00:04:01,175 --> 00:04:04,078
Hey folks, can I, can I have
everybody's attention please?

70
00:04:04,112 --> 00:04:05,847
On the wall behind me,

71
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:08,315
it's not just a pretty picture
to distract you

72
00:04:08,348 --> 00:04:11,451
while you're waiting in line
to take a shit.

73
00:04:12,385 --> 00:04:14,254
And to be honest,
the way that you guys are

74
00:04:14,287 --> 00:04:17,058
treating this painting
is upsetting my friend.

75
00:04:17,091 --> 00:04:19,627
This is a man's soul right here.

76
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:21,195
Yeah.

77
00:04:21,229 --> 00:04:24,632
And he's,
he's bearing it in the hopes

78
00:04:24,665 --> 00:04:28,236
that for a split second,
you will go beyond your own lives.

79
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:31,672
Go beyond your need
to just buy things.

80
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,776
So ladies and gentlemen...

81
00:04:36,911 --> 00:04:37,745
This is...

82
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:40,480
This is a way out.

83
00:04:41,749 --> 00:04:43,217

84
00:04:43,251 --> 00:04:44,218

86
00:04:45,219 --> 00:04:47,021
So eat it up.

87
00:04:47,054 --> 00:04:49,791
Don't eat shoes.
Don't eat skateboards.

88
00:04:49,824 --> 00:04:53,094
Don't eat nail polish.
Eat the art.

89
00:04:53,127 --> 00:04:54,662
Eat the art! Eat the art!

90
00:04:54,695 --> 00:04:56,130

91
00:04:56,164 --> 00:04:57,430
It tastes good.
It tastes really good.

92
00:04:57,464 --> 00:04:58,866
Eat the art.

93
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:00,234
All together now.

94
00:05:00,268 --> 00:05:01,269
Eat the art.

95
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:02,970
Eat the art, eat the art,

96
00:05:03,004 --> 00:05:05,039
eat the art, eat the art,

97
00:05:05,072 --> 00:05:06,473
eat the art.

98
00:05:06,507 --> 00:05:07,742

to hear this,

99
00:05:07,775 --> 00:05:09,777

No.

107
00:05:46,747 --> 00:05:47,715
No, I just have something
in my eye.

108
00:05:47,748 --> 00:05:49,349
Will you look at it?

109
00:05:49,382 --> 00:05:50,718
I really think I have
something in my eye.

110
00:05:50,751 --> 00:05:52,352
- Ew, ew.
- No, don't you see it?

111
00:05:52,385 --> 00:05:53,721
Is it an eyelash
or like a bug or something?

112
00:05:53,754 --> 00:05:54,589
- Do you see-
- So fucking gross.

113
00:05:54,622 --> 00:05:56,090
Hey Frankie.

114
00:05:56,123 --> 00:05:57,357
Romeo.

115
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:58,326
You done flirting?

116
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:01,428
Uh, Judy needs you to sub in.

118
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:03,664

119
00:06:03,698 --> 00:06:05,032
The baby's not coming, so...

120
00:06:07,068 --> 00:06:07,869
That's pretty rough.

121

00:08:43,391 --> 00:08:44,859
(Link laughs)

187
00:08:44,892 --> 00:08:45,860
That's my day job.

188
00:08:46,727 --> 00:08:48,763
Think you can do better?

189
00:08:48,796 --> 00:08:51,832
Uh, yes.

190
00:08:51,866 --> 00:08:52,700
Hey.

191
00:08:55,236 --> 00:08:56,871
- (splashing)
- Oh!

192
00:08:56,904 --> 00:09:01,108
Yeah!
(clapping)

193
00:09:01,142 --> 00:09:02,209
Seriously?

194
00:09:02,243 --> 00:09:03,677
It's like a five.

195
00:09:03,711 --> 00:09:05,446
What am I gonna say?
It's a five.

196
00:09:05,479 --> 00:09:07,381
I filmed your speech
and I posted it on YouTube

197
00:09:07,415 --> 00:09:09,784
and it's doing really well.

198
00:09:09,817 --> 00:09:11,318
Like really, really,
really well,

199
00:09:11,352 --> 00:09:14,055
and it's already got like,
2000 views.

200
00:09:15,256 --> 00:09:16,891
Uh, is that a lot?

201
00:09:16,924 --> 00:09:18,726
For me, yeah.

202
00:09:18,759 --> 00:09:20,361
I only have like, you know,
barely 100 subscribers.

203
00:09:20,394 --> 00:09:21,862
I don't know,
people are commenting things

204
00:09:21,896 --> 00:09:23,197
and it's all really positive
and...

205
00:09:24,498 --> 00:09:25,332
That's good.

206
00:09:27,168 --> 00:09:29,504
(splashing)

207
00:09:30,838 --> 00:09:32,006
How was that?

208
00:09:32,039 --> 00:09:33,107
That's a seven.

209
00:09:34,575 --> 00:09:35,976
Sammy, time to go.

210
00:09:36,010 --> 00:09:37,378
Say goodbye to your friend Link.

211
00:09:37,411 --> 00:09:39,246
But we're not finished.

212
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:41,182
That's all right,
we'll finish later.

213
00:09:43,384 --> 00:09:44,985
Okay?

214
00:09:45,019 --> 00:09:46,720
Come on, Sammy.

215
00:09:46,754 --> 00:09:47,955
Thanks for watching her.

216
00:09:48,856 --> 00:09:49,857
Yeah, sure.

217
00:09:52,893 --> 00:09:53,961
Good for you.

218
00:09:55,629 --> 00:09:58,399
(splashing)

219
00:09:58,432 --> 00:10:00,401
I'd like to give you
my information

220
00:10:00,434 --> 00:10:03,404
so that if you want
to find me, you can.

221
00:10:03,437 --> 00:10:05,406
I work at Magic Alley Bar.

222
00:10:07,274 --> 00:10:09,076
Is that a bar for magicians?

223
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:10,911
No, it's, sometimes
there are magicians there

224
00:10:10,945 --> 00:10:12,379
but it's just a regular bar.

225
00:10:12,413 --> 00:10:13,981
It's not even that far
from here.

226
00:10:16,551 --> 00:10:19,019
Oh, I'm gonna check
roach man's schedule.

227
00:10:19,053 --> 00:10:19,920
He's a busy guy.

228
00:10:21,222 --> 00:10:23,124
Okay, I'm gonna put it
in your shoe.

229
00:10:25,426 --> 00:10:28,262
(water splashing)

230
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:34,635
- (soft jazz music)
- (people chattering)

231
00:10:41,008 --> 00:10:43,077
I don't get people's taste
anymore.

232
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:44,378
People don't have taste anymore.

233
00:10:44,411 --> 00:10:45,813
They are just horny.

234
00:10:47,781 --> 00:10:49,283
Well that really depressing.

235
00:10:50,317 --> 00:10:52,653
- Makes me wanna cry.
- (water spurting)

236
00:10:52,686 --> 00:10:53,921
(laughing)

237
00:10:53,954 --> 00:10:55,489
- It's good, right?
- Yeah.

238
00:10:55,524 --> 00:10:57,224
You know what else
makes me really sad?

239
00:10:57,258 --> 00:10:59,059
Well hello boys and girls.

240
00:10:59,093 --> 00:11:01,395
Don't you just love feathers
and bells?

241
00:11:01,428 --> 00:11:02,597
(Frankie sighs)

242
00:11:02,631 --> 00:11:03,430
(burps)

243
00:11:03,464 --> 00:11:04,265
I'm hungry.

244
00:11:04,298 --> 00:11:05,266
You little baby.

245
00:11:05,299 --> 00:11:06,500
She needs her milk.

246
00:11:06,535 --> 00:11:08,169
Nice, warm milk.

247
00:11:08,202 --> 00:11:10,437
- Goo goo goo goo goo.
- (clapping)

248
00:11:10,471 --> 00:11:11,640
Yes.

249
00:11:11,672 --> 00:11:14,008
Oh, wait, something smells.

250
00:11:14,041 --> 00:11:15,442
That could be some gas.

251
00:11:16,443 --> 00:11:18,647
- Burp, baby, burp.
- (people laughing)

252
00:11:18,679 --> 00:11:20,515
- Some gas.
- Stop!

253
00:11:20,549 --> 00:11:21,415
Whoa!

254
00:11:21,448 --> 00:11:22,651
What the?

255
00:11:22,683 --> 00:11:24,952
Stop, stop!

256
00:11:24,985 --> 00:11:26,153
Let me see this.

257
00:11:26,187 --> 00:11:27,421
I'm gonna get you out of here.

258
00:11:27,454 --> 00:11:28,856
- Trust me.
- The gas man.

259
00:11:28,889 --> 00:11:31,859
Oh! Listen up,
you motherfudgers!

260
00:11:31,892 --> 00:11:33,194
(laughing)

261
00:11:33,227 --> 00:11:35,496
(laughs)
Whoa.

262
00:11:35,530 --> 00:11:37,599
This shit isn't funny.

263
00:11:37,632 --> 00:11:39,333
- Hey!
- This shit's just mean.

264
00:11:39,366 --> 00:11:41,869
Yo, let the old lady
finish her act, you freak.

265
00:11:41,902 --> 00:11:43,638
Oh, yo, you want to come up

266
00:11:43,672 --> 00:11:45,272
and suck on the bottle
while everybody laughs?

267
00:11:45,306 --> 00:11:48,108
Be my guest, you Nazi cracker!

268
00:11:48,142 --> 00:11:49,176
Nazi cra....

269
00:11:50,311 --> 00:11:52,980
Hey! Take your ass back
to the loony bin, why don't you?

270
00:11:53,814 --> 00:11:55,115
- Yeah.
- Oh, this is so funny,

271
00:11:55,149 --> 00:11:57,117
- isn't it, Marty?
- (tense music)

272
00:11:57,151 --> 00:11:58,319
Fuck you!

273
00:11:58,352 --> 00:11:59,453
Oh, look, he knows how to run!

274
00:11:59,486 --> 00:12:01,021
Fuck.

275
00:12:01,055 --> 00:12:05,759
- (tense, dramatic music)
- (laughing)

276
00:12:06,661 --> 00:12:10,397
- (clapping)
- (tense, dramatic music)

277
00:12:10,431 --> 00:12:12,534
That's Hollywood,
when even the bugs

278
00:12:12,567 --> 00:12:14,235
love the spotlight.

279
00:12:17,706 --> 00:12:18,806
- You okay?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

280
00:12:18,839 --> 00:12:20,074
I got it. I got it.

281
00:12:20,107 --> 00:12:21,475
Okay, okay, okay.

282
00:12:21,509 --> 00:12:22,677
- You good?
- Hey, he's with me.

283
00:12:22,711 --> 00:12:23,877
He's with me. He's my friend.

284
00:12:23,911 --> 00:12:24,679
- He's my friend.
- I'm good.

285
00:12:24,713 --> 00:12:25,547
Come on.

286
00:12:26,615 --> 00:12:27,781
Jesus Christ.

287
00:12:28,916 --> 00:12:30,484
(Link laughing)

288
00:12:30,518 --> 00:12:32,253
Hey, hey, hey.

289
00:12:32,286 --> 00:12:33,387
- Hey.
- (Link laughing)

290
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:35,155
Thank you for the service.

291
00:12:35,189 --> 00:12:37,825
The first class service.
Thank you.

292
00:12:37,858 --> 00:12:38,693
Oh my God.

293
00:12:39,628 --> 00:12:42,129
(Link laughs)

294
00:12:44,798 --> 00:12:47,401
You do know that they pay me
to do that.

295
00:12:48,570 --> 00:12:49,403
Well...

296
00:12:52,574 --> 00:12:54,441
(sighs)

297
00:12:54,475 --> 00:12:55,543
Well, you didn't seem like
you were enjoying yourself.

298
00:12:57,077 --> 00:12:59,480
(soft music)

299
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:06,887
So is uh,
is that kinda your thing?

300
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:09,056
To dress up in animal costumes?

301
00:13:09,089 --> 00:13:10,257
Uh...

302
00:13:11,425 --> 00:13:12,259
Well, you know,

303
00:13:14,228 --> 00:13:17,231
if you're in a costume it's
easier to spot the other freaks.

304
00:13:21,636 --> 00:13:23,270
Can I film you?

305
00:13:23,304 --> 00:13:25,507
Uh, sure, weirdo.

306
00:13:27,908 --> 00:13:29,076
Oh.

307
00:13:29,109 --> 00:13:31,045
If you clean me up right here.

308
00:13:31,078 --> 00:13:34,582
(Frankie chuckles)
Okay.

309
00:13:38,919 --> 00:13:40,454
- Right here?
- Yeah.

310
00:13:40,487 --> 00:13:45,492
- Okay.
- (soft synth music)

311
00:14:06,548 --> 00:14:10,585
Will you tell me
why you don't like cell phones?

312
00:14:10,618 --> 00:14:12,821
Will you tell me
why you don't smoke crack?

313
00:14:14,221 --> 00:14:17,291
This is why.
'Cause where are you?

314
00:14:18,192 --> 00:14:19,426
I'm right here.

315
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:20,294
Nah, you gotta kick the habit.

316
00:14:20,327 --> 00:14:21,830
Hey. That's mine.

317
00:14:21,862 --> 00:14:23,030
Hey, hey, hey.
Please give that back.

318
00:14:23,063 --> 00:14:25,032
Hey.

319
00:14:25,065 --> 00:14:27,468
(grunting)

320
00:14:27,502 --> 00:14:29,671
Oh! (chuckles)

321
00:14:29,704 --> 00:14:31,806
(grunts)

322
00:14:32,973 --> 00:14:34,709
- Do you eat peanuts?
- What?

323
00:14:34,743 --> 00:14:36,210
Can you eat peanuts?

324
00:14:36,243 --> 00:14:37,378
There's a lot of peanuts
in Thai food.

325
00:14:38,312 --> 00:14:40,849
I'm gonna be at the Thai place
on Bronson tomorrow

326
00:14:40,881 --> 00:14:41,882
if you want to come.

327
00:14:42,717 --> 00:14:43,818
Noon.

328
00:14:43,852 --> 00:14:44,686
Okay.

329
00:14:45,553 --> 00:14:47,388
My name is Link, by the way.

330
00:14:50,090 --> 00:14:50,891
Here comes your baby.

331
00:14:50,924 --> 00:14:51,760
Wait.

332
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:53,628
Fuck!

333
00:14:53,661 --> 00:14:54,629
Wow, she caught it.

334
00:14:54,662 --> 00:14:56,330
The crowd goes wild.

335
00:14:57,565 --> 00:14:58,399
Asshole.

336
00:15:02,002 --> 00:15:03,303
(people chattering)

337
00:15:03,337 --> 00:15:04,506
- (Frankie laughs)
- That's crazy.

338
00:15:04,539 --> 00:15:05,472
What the...

339
00:15:05,507 --> 00:15:06,508
Ooh.

340
00:15:06,541 --> 00:15:07,575
Wee-ooh.

341
00:15:07,609 --> 00:15:08,409
Ooh.

342
00:15:08,442 --> 00:15:09,276
Whoa, Whoa.

343
00:15:10,210 --> 00:15:11,044
What the?

344
00:15:12,413 --> 00:15:13,914
Magic.

345
00:15:13,947 --> 00:15:15,382
Wow.

346
00:15:15,416 --> 00:15:16,851
So, what,
do you come here often?

347
00:15:16,885 --> 00:15:18,218
No, please. Please talk to me.

348
00:15:18,252 --> 00:15:19,153
Talk to me. Talk to me.

349
00:15:19,186 --> 00:15:20,020
Please come back.

350
00:15:21,623 --> 00:15:23,090
Just for a little bit.

351
00:15:23,123 --> 00:15:24,559
All right,
what do you wanna know?

352
00:15:27,127 --> 00:15:28,530
Tell me about your parents.

353
00:15:28,563 --> 00:15:29,396
They're dead.

354
00:15:30,532 --> 00:15:31,331
Really?

355
00:15:31,365 --> 00:15:32,834
Yeah.

356
00:15:32,867 --> 00:15:33,735
I'm really sorry.

357
00:15:33,768 --> 00:15:34,636
It's all right.

358
00:15:35,936 --> 00:15:36,905
It was a long time ago.

359
00:15:38,272 --> 00:15:39,072
(sighs)

360
00:15:39,106 --> 00:15:40,542
Measles.

361
00:15:40,575 --> 00:15:42,176
Measles?

362
00:15:42,209 --> 00:15:44,278
It was the Civil War,
so, you know.

363
00:15:45,212 --> 00:15:48,115
Did your parents really die
or are you...

364
00:15:48,148 --> 00:15:49,383
Yeah.

365
00:15:49,416 --> 00:15:51,753
Okay, so tell me this.

366
00:15:51,786 --> 00:15:53,555
How does that feel?

367
00:15:53,588 --> 00:15:55,122
Okay.

368
00:15:55,155 --> 00:15:56,558
Yeah.

369
00:15:56,591 --> 00:15:58,660
(growls)

370
00:16:02,129 --> 00:16:04,298
Why don't you say something
really profound and moving,

371
00:16:04,331 --> 00:16:05,733
just like that?
(snaps fingers)

372
00:16:05,767 --> 00:16:07,234
Come on, you can do it.

373
00:16:07,267 --> 00:16:08,870
No, but seriously.

374
00:16:08,903 --> 00:16:10,672
What do you wanna do
with your life, Frankie?

375
00:16:13,741 --> 00:16:15,375
I don't know.

376
00:16:15,409 --> 00:16:17,144
Okay, well, if you did know,
what would it be?

377
00:16:17,177 --> 00:16:18,780
I don't know. I don't know
what I'm doing right now.

378
00:16:18,813 --> 00:16:22,282
I don't know what I want to do.
I don't know.

379
00:16:22,316 --> 00:16:24,117
You want to make art?

380
00:16:24,151 --> 00:16:25,553
Sure, I want to make art.

381
00:16:25,587 --> 00:16:26,987
Wow.

382
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:28,823
That's great.

383
00:16:28,857 --> 00:16:30,424
All right, well what kind
of stuff you want to make?

384
00:16:30,457 --> 00:16:32,560
I don't know.

385
00:16:32,594 --> 00:16:36,296
I want to make things that
make other people feel things.

386
00:16:38,265 --> 00:16:39,834
All right.
Tell me about that scar.

387
00:16:41,703 --> 00:16:44,137
(soft music)

388
00:16:45,005 --> 00:16:45,874
Why'd you do that?

389
00:16:47,007 --> 00:16:48,843
It's beautiful.
It's a part of you.

390
00:16:48,877 --> 00:16:50,678
All right.
The intimacy levels are too high.

391
00:16:50,712 --> 00:16:51,546
Abort mission.

392
00:16:53,046 --> 00:16:54,616
(Frankie laughs)

393
00:16:54,649 --> 00:16:56,183
Did you even watch
the video I posted?

394
00:16:56,216 --> 00:16:57,752
No.

395
00:16:57,785 --> 00:16:59,988
People really responded to it.
To you.

396
00:17:01,121 --> 00:17:02,924
You don't even know
how hard it is

397
00:17:02,957 --> 00:17:04,458
to get views on the internet.

398
00:17:05,392 --> 00:17:07,829
Will you just look
at the comments?

399
00:17:14,368 --> 00:17:16,838
"The only thing in doubt
about your speech

400
00:17:16,871 --> 00:17:19,039
is whether it makes me
want to puke

401
00:17:19,072 --> 00:17:21,141
or kill myself and then puke."

402
00:17:21,174 --> 00:17:22,644
That's...

403
00:17:22,677 --> 00:17:24,211
They signed it
sincerely everyone.

404
00:17:24,244 --> 00:17:25,880
That's so sweet.

405
00:17:25,914 --> 00:17:27,515
Thank you for showing me that.

406
00:17:27,549 --> 00:17:28,950
There are more positive ones
than nasty ones.

407
00:17:28,983 --> 00:17:30,018
All right,
so what do you wanna do?

408
00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:31,251
Do you want to make art,

409
00:17:32,319 --> 00:17:35,422
or do you want to chase affirmation
from faceless strangers?

410
00:17:43,998 --> 00:17:45,533
Both.

411
00:17:45,567 --> 00:17:46,701
Get out of my house.

412
00:17:48,235 --> 00:17:49,737
I'm moving in.

413
00:17:49,771 --> 00:17:51,706
There's not enough space
for two.

414
00:17:51,739 --> 00:17:52,574
See.

415
00:17:53,841 --> 00:17:55,242
- It's super cramped.
- (Frankie laughs)

416
00:17:55,275 --> 00:17:56,578
It actually kind of works.

417
00:17:58,046 --> 00:18:00,414

Psst.

429
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:09,784
What are you doing?

430
00:19:11,519 --> 00:19:12,720
Trying to keep a low profile.

431
00:19:12,754 --> 00:19:14,388
They don't much like me here.

432
00:19:14,421 --> 00:19:15,590
Remember?

433
00:19:15,623 --> 00:19:16,524
You got a phone?

434
00:19:19,761 --> 00:19:21,395
I thought phones
were crack cocaine.

435
00:19:21,428 --> 00:19:23,831
Well, to defeat the beast,
first you gotta

436
00:19:23,865 --> 00:19:24,732
get inside its belly.

437
00:19:24,766 --> 00:19:25,600
Look...

438
00:19:27,635 --> 00:19:29,202
I'm gonna cut to the chase, kid.

439
00:19:31,371 --> 00:19:32,607
I think you got potential.

440
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:33,641
I wanna make your next picture.

441
00:19:36,044 --> 00:19:37,111
- Really?
- Yeah.

442
00:19:39,947 --> 00:19:41,015
What? Now?

443
00:19:41,049 --> 00:19:41,683
Yeah, right now, let's go.

444
00:19:41,716 --> 00:19:42,917
No.

445
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:43,918
I'm in the middle of my shift.

446
00:19:43,951 --> 00:19:45,019
Eh, fuck your shift.

447
00:19:45,053 --> 00:19:45,920
(Frankie laughs)

448
00:19:45,953 --> 00:19:47,254
Come on.

449
00:19:47,287 --> 00:19:48,756
Not everyone can fuck the shift.

450
00:19:48,790 --> 00:19:50,658
Some people have
to go to their shifts.

451
00:19:50,692 --> 00:19:52,660
Some people.
You want to be those some people?

452
00:19:52,694 --> 00:19:53,761
No.

453
00:19:53,795 --> 00:19:55,228
You wanna be what then?

454
00:19:56,463 --> 00:19:58,099
The other kind of person.

455
00:19:58,132 --> 00:19:59,734
So show me. Fuck the shift.

456
00:20:00,702 --> 00:20:01,869
Fuck the shift.

457
00:20:01,903 --> 00:20:02,704
Fuck the shift.

458
00:20:02,737 --> 00:20:03,705
Fuck this place.

459
00:20:03,738 --> 00:20:05,305
Fuck this place.

460
00:20:05,338 --> 00:20:06,874
Fuck dressing up
in a fucking baby costume.

461
00:20:06,908 --> 00:20:08,109
Yeah, yeah.

462
00:20:08,142 --> 00:20:08,943
Fuck people who shit in sinks.

463
00:20:08,976 --> 00:20:10,044
Fuck people who-

464
00:20:10,078 --> 00:20:11,278
- Wait, wh...
- Yeah.

465
00:20:11,311 --> 00:20:13,380
Fuck my boss, fuck my uniform.

466
00:20:13,413 --> 00:20:14,414
Okay, let's go.

467
00:20:16,517 --> 00:20:18,052
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

468
00:20:18,086 --> 00:20:19,554
Whoa, where's your car?

469
00:20:19,587 --> 00:20:20,521
I sold it.

470
00:20:20,555 --> 00:20:21,354
I had to pay rent.

471
00:20:21,388 --> 00:20:22,222
Are you serious?

472
00:20:22,255 --> 00:20:24,357
Mhm. Let's go.

473
00:20:24,391 --> 00:20:26,194
Uh...

Whoa, watch the pole,
watch the pole.

477
00:20:36,037 --> 00:20:37,739
On to the new world!

478
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:42,510
(upbeat synth pop music)

479
00:20:42,543 --> 00:20:43,678
What if I covered your eyes?

480
00:20:43,711 --> 00:20:44,746
I'd be like don't cover my eyes.

481
00:20:44,779 --> 00:20:46,379
No, no, no, no, no, no.

482

484
00:20:54,622 --> 00:20:55,455
What have I done?

485
00:20:59,292 --> 00:21:02,262
You did an amazing thing.
(chuckles)

486
00:21:02,295 --> 00:21:04,665
I walked out on my job.

487
00:21:04,699 --> 00:21:08,536
I have no money
and no idea how to get any.

488
00:21:10,571 --> 00:21:11,773
This is the beginning.

489
00:21:12,707 --> 00:21:14,041
Of unemployment.

490
00:21:14,075 --> 00:21:15,275
No.

491
00:21:15,308 --> 00:21:18,179
Well, yeah, but of everything.

492
00:21:18,212 --> 00:21:20,081
Now you could just
concentrate on your art.

493
00:21:20,114 --> 00:21:21,082
Mhm.

494
00:21:21,115 --> 00:21:22,315
That's a great idea.

495
00:21:23,785 --> 00:21:25,219
What are you doing?

496
00:21:25,253 --> 00:21:27,054
- (Link grumbling)
- (breathing heavily)

497
00:21:27,088 --> 00:21:27,989

499
00:21:30,725 --> 00:21:31,559
Get out.

500
00:21:33,094 --> 00:21:34,494
We gotta cast demons out.

501
00:21:35,563 --> 00:21:36,864
- Gotta get the demons out.
- No, no, no, no.

502
00:21:36,898 --> 00:21:38,298
That's dumb.

503
00:21:38,331 --> 00:21:39,534
- No demons.
- Yeah, no, it's dumb.

504
00:21:39,567 --> 00:21:40,935
You gotta be dumb to be smart.

No, no, no, no, no.

This is dumb.

508
00:21:44,138 --> 00:21:45,640
We have to cast 'em out.

509
00:21:45,673 --> 00:21:47,141
- We gotta cast 'em out.
- What are you-

510
00:21:47,175 --> 00:21:48,543
Cast out the demons.

who don't identify as human.

00:23:55,369 --> 00:23:56,570
What did I say?

551
00:23:56,604 --> 00:23:58,940
Exactly. You have to say stuff.

552
00:23:58,973 --> 00:24:00,508
Like the animal stuff?
What are you talking about?

553
00:24:00,541 --> 00:24:01,876
No.

554
00:24:01,909 --> 00:24:03,344
Um...

555
00:24:03,377 --> 00:24:04,211
Ah...

556
00:24:05,713 --> 00:24:06,547
Okay.

557
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:13,921
That's what people
are responding to,

558
00:24:13,955 --> 00:24:15,690
is you saying stuff,
so all I have to do

559
00:24:15,723 --> 00:24:17,425
is figure out
how to capture you saying stuff

560
00:24:17,457 --> 00:24:20,328
without it just being you
saying stuff.

561
00:24:26,934 --> 00:24:28,235
Bud, you're putting me
as such a bad pos...

562
00:24:28,269 --> 00:24:29,469
I've seen a lot of fake IDs.

563
00:24:29,503 --> 00:24:30,905
This is so terrible.

564
00:24:30,938 --> 00:24:32,940
This is such a terrible idea.

565
00:24:32,974 --> 00:24:35,576
Like the sticker's coming off.
Do better.

566
00:24:35,609 --> 00:24:36,644
Just go get drunk.

567
00:24:37,511 --> 00:24:38,512
Don't get too drunk.

568
00:24:47,254 --> 00:24:48,055
Psst.

569
00:24:48,089 --> 00:24:50,091
(gasps)

570
00:24:51,592 --> 00:24:52,526
What's up?

571
00:24:53,493 --> 00:24:55,463
We're starting a band.

572
00:24:55,495 --> 00:24:56,797
Are, are you guys high?

573
00:24:57,765 --> 00:24:59,667
We need a writer. We suck.

574
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:01,235
Are you in?

575
00:25:01,268 --> 00:25:02,770
You need a writer? For what?

576
00:25:04,839 --> 00:25:05,940
A secret project.

577
00:25:08,209 --> 00:25:09,243
(upbeat percussive music)

578
00:25:09,276 --> 00:25:10,277
Oh shit, mom, I gotta go.

579
00:25:10,311 --> 00:25:11,145
<i>Yo, yo, what's up?</i>

580
00:25:11,178 --> 00:25:12,947
Yo, what's up?

581
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:14,348
Thanks for tuning in
and checking out this video.

582
00:25:14,382 --> 00:25:15,416
Checking out this video.

583
00:25:15,449 --> 00:25:17,518
Rock effect.

584
00:25:17,551 --> 00:25:19,954
My motherfucking life and all
the dope ass shit around me.

585
00:25:19,987 --> 00:25:21,956
Parents use YouTube
as a babysitter.

586
00:25:21,989 --> 00:25:24,191
Like my little niece
who's seven years old,

587
00:25:24,225 --> 00:25:26,694
she worships these guys
who do and say nothing

588
00:25:26,727 --> 00:25:28,796
and promote a lifestyle
of doing and saying nothing.

589
00:25:28,829 --> 00:25:30,031
I don't even need this phone.

590
00:25:30,064 --> 00:25:31,298
(girls scream)

591
00:25:31,332 --> 00:25:32,299
<i>Is it okay?</i>

592
00:25:32,333 --> 00:25:33,300
All right. (laughs)

593
00:25:33,334 --> 00:25:34,869
I need it. (laughs)

594
00:25:34,902 --> 00:25:36,637
They're sucked in
and they're like watching

595
00:25:36,670 --> 00:25:38,139
the same kind of videos
that they're always watching

596
00:25:38,172 --> 00:25:39,373
and at the end, boom,
it's a satire.

597
00:25:39,407 --> 00:25:41,275
Yo, why is my existence so lit?

598
00:25:41,308 --> 00:25:42,877
Why is my life so lit?

599
00:25:42,910 --> 00:25:44,812
Let's start with
this eagle's nest behind me.

600
00:25:44,845 --> 00:25:46,147
I know how to shoot it, too.

601
00:25:47,915 --> 00:25:49,717
You gotta see this.

602
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:51,719
Yo, eight million big ones,
eight million big ones.

603
00:25:51,752 --> 00:25:53,454
<i>We've got to do
everything we can</i>

604
00:25:53,487 --> 00:25:54,855
<i>to make our thing look
as crappy as their thing.</i>

605
00:25:54,889 --> 00:25:55,956
That's brilliant.

606
00:25:55,990 --> 00:25:57,625
All right. Let's do it.

607
00:25:57,658 --> 00:26:00,661
Seven bedrooms
and dos Mother Hubbard piscinas.

608
00:26:01,595 --> 00:26:03,197
Is that right? Is that Spanish?

609
00:26:03,230 --> 00:26:05,166
Think that's Italian.

610
00:26:05,199 --> 00:26:07,134
Regulation height
for a hoop is like 10 feet.

611
00:26:07,168 --> 00:26:08,736
I keep mine at seven.
You know why?

612
00:26:08,769 --> 00:26:10,004
I got a small penis.

613
00:26:10,037 --> 00:26:11,705
Hashtag be yourself.

614
00:26:11,739 --> 00:26:13,674
That's my message
to the world is be yourself.

615
00:26:13,707 --> 00:26:15,409
That's what I do
and look what I got.

616
00:26:15,443 --> 00:26:17,512
Hashtag swimming pool,
hashtag cocktail,

617
00:26:17,546 --> 00:26:19,046
hashtag this pineapple life.

618
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:20,981
Yo, it's so important
to be yourself,

619
00:26:21,015 --> 00:26:22,416
but only your best parts only,
only your pretty parts.

620
00:26:22,450 --> 00:26:23,717
Not that weak shit.

621
00:26:23,751 --> 00:26:25,086
Yo, is that right? Is that...

622
00:26:25,119 --> 00:26:26,420
That's the message, right?

623
00:26:28,222 --> 00:26:30,157
(splashing)

624
00:26:30,191 --> 00:26:32,193
When I see other celebrities
like on the 'gram and shit,

625
00:26:32,226 --> 00:26:33,761
I feel kind of bad about
myself, so I buy more stuff.

626
00:26:33,794 --> 00:26:35,496
Hashtag when, hashtag why,
hashtag wow.

627
00:26:35,530 --> 00:26:36,864
Which is great,
'cause then I just end up

628
00:26:36,897 --> 00:26:39,333
with so much, you know, stuff.

629
00:26:39,366 --> 00:26:41,368
Stuff makes me feel like,

630
00:26:41,402 --> 00:26:43,938
like less than empty inside,
you know?

631
00:26:43,971 --> 00:26:45,606
Hashtag when is it too much?

632
00:26:45,639 --> 00:26:47,408
Hashtag when is it all
going to stop?

633
00:26:47,441 --> 00:26:48,776
- Hey you!
- (gun cocks)

634
00:26:48,809 --> 00:26:50,177
- Shit!
- Get off my property!

635
00:26:50,211 --> 00:26:51,378
- We got the wrong house!
- (gunshot)

636
00:26:51,412 --> 00:26:52,413
- Sorry!
- Get outta here!

637
00:26:52,446 --> 00:26:54,516
I got, I got confused!

638
00:26:54,549 --> 00:26:55,550
I got confused!

639
00:26:55,584 --> 00:26:57,618
(laughing)

640
00:26:57,651 --> 00:26:59,386
- Come on, come on, come on!
- Fuck!

641
00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:00,387
Jesus.

642
00:27:00,421 --> 00:27:01,556
All right, where are we?

643
00:27:02,957 --> 00:27:05,826
Oh my god,
I'm spiraling right now.

644
00:27:08,162 --> 00:27:09,363
I've been getting it all wrong.

645
00:27:09,396 --> 00:27:11,298
I've been poisoning y'all.

646
00:27:11,332 --> 00:27:12,366
You can't be following me.

647
00:27:12,399 --> 00:27:13,568
I don't...

648
00:27:13,602 --> 00:27:14,902
I ain't nothin'. I ain't nobody.

649
00:27:14,935 --> 00:27:16,237
I'm no one.

650
00:27:16,270 --> 00:27:18,405
Like I'm no one special, man.

651
00:27:18,439 --> 00:27:20,407
We gotta wake ourselves up.

652
00:27:20,441 --> 00:27:22,309
Oh, it feels so good to be free.

653
00:27:25,112 --> 00:27:27,414
I'm reborn, man, I'm reborn.

654
00:27:28,749 --> 00:27:29,618
Can you relate?

655
00:27:30,619 --> 00:27:32,253
Someone stole my pants.

656
00:27:32,286 --> 00:27:33,120
Woo!

657
00:27:34,488 --> 00:27:36,790
We're going back to nature,
baby.

658
00:27:36,824 --> 00:27:38,259
Yo, you don't need
any of that shit.

659
00:27:38,292 --> 00:27:39,561
You don't need any of that shit.

660
00:27:39,594 --> 00:27:40,629
Can I get an amen?

661
00:27:40,661 --> 00:27:42,129
Can I get an amen baby?

662
00:27:42,163 --> 00:27:43,397
Who's with me?

663
00:27:43,430 --> 00:27:44,665
Y'all feelin' me?

664
00:27:44,698 --> 00:27:45,799
Can you relate?

665
00:27:45,833 --> 00:27:46,834
Can you relate?

666
00:27:46,867 --> 00:27:49,103
Yeah! You can relate!

667
00:27:49,136 --> 00:27:50,304
You're feelin' me!

668
00:27:50,337 --> 00:27:51,606
- Woo!
- What the hell?

669
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:52,641
Hey!

670
00:27:52,673 --> 00:27:53,841
Man, got any spare pants?

671
00:27:53,874 --> 00:27:55,242
Hey. Hey man, hey.

672
00:27:55,276 --> 00:27:56,578
Oh what's up, baby?

673
00:27:56,611 --> 00:27:57,845
- What's up?
- Face that way.

674
00:27:57,878 --> 00:27:59,648
- Hey, I know you!
- Face that wall.

675
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:01,248
I know you.

676
00:28:01,282 --> 00:28:02,517
I just woke up in my soul,
in my heart.

677
00:28:03,450 --> 00:28:04,586
You feelin' me baby?

678
00:28:04,619 --> 00:28:06,987
I know you feelin' me baby, yes.

679
00:28:07,021 --> 00:28:08,322
Can I get an amen?

680
00:28:08,355 --> 00:28:09,924
Where am I?

681
00:28:09,957 --> 00:28:11,158
Where am I?

682
00:28:11,192 --> 00:28:13,662
Oh, I love this town.

683
00:28:13,694 --> 00:28:16,297
I love you. I love you so much.

684
00:28:17,331 --> 00:28:18,499
Holy shit.

685
00:28:18,533 --> 00:28:20,669
Holy shit. You gotta see this.

686
00:28:20,701 --> 00:28:21,702
Whoa.

687
00:28:21,735 --> 00:28:23,204
Look at all the comments.

688
00:28:23,237 --> 00:28:24,872
"I want this guy
to run me over in a truck

689
00:28:24,905 --> 00:28:26,273
and then reverse
over my dead body."

690
00:28:26,307 --> 00:28:27,107
That's interesting.

691
00:28:27,141 --> 00:28:28,309
Oh my God.

692
00:28:28,342 --> 00:28:30,110
Juanpa just sent me a selfie.

693
00:28:30,144 --> 00:28:31,312
He wants to do an interview
with you.

694
00:28:31,345 --> 00:28:32,681
Juanpa's huge.

695
00:28:32,713 --> 00:28:34,014
Juanpa's huge.

696
00:28:34,048 --> 00:28:35,216
I don't,
I don't know who that is.

697
00:28:35,249 --> 00:28:36,884
Guys, guys, look at the views.

698
00:28:40,254 --> 00:28:42,423
(screams)

699
00:28:43,424 --> 00:28:47,928
(Juanpa speaking
in foreign language)

700
00:28:51,232 --> 00:28:54,835
We are officially live,
ladies and gentlemen.

701
00:28:54,868 --> 00:28:56,036
Welcome.

702
00:28:56,070 --> 00:28:57,505
This is a very special episode

703
00:28:57,539 --> 00:28:59,306
because we got
a very rare guest.

704
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:02,309
Please give it up
for No One Special.

705
00:29:02,343 --> 00:29:04,078
- (clapping)
- Woo hoo hoo!

706
00:29:04,111 --> 00:29:06,013
And by the way, I'm not
being a terrible friend here.

707
00:29:06,046 --> 00:29:07,582
That's how you call yourself,
right?

708
00:29:07,616 --> 00:29:09,651
That's my name.
It's my given name.

709
00:29:09,684 --> 00:29:10,818
- No.
- At birth, yeah.

710
00:29:10,851 --> 00:29:11,885
No One Special.

711
00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:13,354
Wow.

712
00:29:13,387 --> 00:29:14,922
No one is like one word
and then special.

713
00:29:14,955 --> 00:29:16,423
Like we're all kind of
no one special.

714
00:29:16,457 --> 00:29:17,258
That's just kind of the idea,
right?

715
00:29:17,291 --> 00:29:18,693
Yeah.

716
00:29:18,727 --> 00:29:20,160
We're all the same.
We're all equal.

717
00:29:20,194 --> 00:29:21,362
Okay. Okay,
let's try this again.

718
00:29:21,395 --> 00:29:22,930
- When I clap...
- Yeah.

719
00:29:22,963 --> 00:29:26,000
You, you like jump
and fall into frame.

720
00:29:26,033 --> 00:29:27,768
All right.

721
00:29:27,801 --> 00:29:28,769
So I'll clap and I'll stop
and then you jump in.

722
00:29:28,802 --> 00:29:29,770
All right. Let's try it.

723
00:29:29,803 --> 00:29:30,739
- Okay?
- Yep.

724
00:29:30,771 --> 00:29:31,706
Here it is.

725
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:32,773
No One Special!

726
00:29:33,941 --> 00:29:36,277
Oh my God!

727
00:29:36,310 --> 00:29:38,580
I've never seen Juanpa
this happy before.

728
00:29:38,613 --> 00:29:39,780
A couple of questions for you.

729
00:29:39,813 --> 00:29:40,615
Go on.

730
00:29:40,649 --> 00:29:41,849
Uh...

731
00:29:41,882 --> 00:29:42,550
Can I just do this real quick?

732
00:29:42,584 --> 00:29:43,752
Yeah.

733
00:29:43,784 --> 00:29:44,952
Sorry, I've been wanting like,

734
00:29:44,985 --> 00:29:46,420
since I like laid eyes on you,

735
00:29:46,453 --> 00:29:47,388
I've just been wanting
to like...

736
00:29:47,421 --> 00:29:48,122
His name is Isaac.

737
00:29:48,155 --> 00:29:48,956
Oh wow.

738
00:29:48,989 --> 00:29:50,692
Pretty deep.

739
00:29:50,725 --> 00:29:52,293
Pretty deep first moments
with No One Special.

740
00:29:52,326 --> 00:29:53,961
I just feel like
we need experience other...

741
00:29:53,994 --> 00:29:55,429
All right, all right,
do we first bump now?

742
00:29:55,462 --> 00:29:56,930
No, I just hump you
with my beard.

743
00:29:56,964 --> 00:29:57,965
Can we just fist bump?
(Link laughs)

744
00:29:57,998 --> 00:29:59,900
Okay, anyways. Boom, bam.

745
00:29:59,933 --> 00:30:01,902
Your boyfriend's fine.

746
00:30:01,935 --> 00:30:03,404
- He's not my boyfriend.
- He's not my boyfriend.

747
00:30:03,437 --> 00:30:05,406
I uh, I represent Juanpa.

748
00:30:05,439 --> 00:30:08,208
So what's what's the next thing
for No One Special?

749
00:30:08,242 --> 00:30:09,276
What's the next thing
for No One...

750
00:30:09,310 --> 00:30:10,745
I don't know.

751
00:30:10,779 --> 00:30:11,780
- I'm just here with Juanpa.
- Yeah?

752
00:30:11,812 --> 00:30:13,147
Here with my hero Juanpa.

753
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:14,415
Eh ah, I'm not your hero,
come on.

754
00:30:14,448 --> 00:30:16,250
You guys need anything,

755
00:30:16,283 --> 00:30:17,251
I want you to...

756
00:30:17,284 --> 00:30:19,920
(wrappers crinkling)

757
00:30:19,953 --> 00:30:24,958
- Give me a call.
- (upbeat synth pop music)

758
00:30:25,459 --> 00:30:27,328
Hey, just take a photo of it.

759
00:30:27,361 --> 00:30:29,229
Yeah, I got it.

760
00:30:29,263 --> 00:30:30,331
I'm Mark Schwartz.

761
00:30:31,599 --> 00:30:33,300
- I'm the guy behind the guy.
- I got a idea, yeah.

762
00:30:33,334 --> 00:30:35,603
I want to invite these guys
to join us on something.

763
00:30:35,637 --> 00:30:37,237
- You want to go with me?
- Bring it.

764
00:30:37,271 --> 00:30:38,773
Me and Juanpa
have an invitation for you.

765
00:30:38,807 --> 00:30:40,608
We want you to join us
tomorrow night

766
00:30:40,642 --> 00:30:43,678
at Four Stone Cemetery
or go to any graveyard near you,

767
00:30:43,712 --> 00:30:45,179
and we,
we're gonna have a party.

768
00:30:45,212 --> 00:30:46,815
You're gonna bring
your cell phones,

769
00:30:46,847 --> 00:30:48,449
but then you're going to
place it on a grave,

770
00:30:48,482 --> 00:30:50,117
you're going to turn
the screen to white,

771
00:30:50,150 --> 00:30:51,586
and together
for one night only we're going

772
00:30:51,619 --> 00:30:53,087
to experience
something real together.

773
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:54,455
We are going to ghost
the internet.

774
00:30:54,488 --> 00:30:56,890
You, me...

775
00:30:58,325 --> 00:31:00,194
And Juanpa.

776
00:31:00,227 --> 00:31:01,696
Would you rather have everything
and understand nothing

777
00:31:01,730 --> 00:31:04,198
or understand everything
and have nothing?

778
00:31:04,231 --> 00:31:05,800
Um, have everything.

779
00:31:05,834 --> 00:31:07,334
Yeah, you'd understand nothing,
though.

780
00:31:07,368 --> 00:31:08,603
(laughing)
Yeah.

781
00:31:08,636 --> 00:31:09,771
That's the premise of the joke.

782
00:31:09,804 --> 00:31:11,706
- That's hard.
- But no,

783
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:13,608
I would just eat donuts and
ride around in a baby carriage

784
00:31:13,641 --> 00:31:16,009
with a chauffeur and I would
buy sunglasses all day.

785
00:31:16,043 --> 00:31:17,144
Yes, I'd wear a muumuu.

786
00:31:17,177 --> 00:31:18,379
I would wear no underwear.

787
00:31:18,412 --> 00:31:20,114
Do another one. Do another one.

788
00:31:20,147 --> 00:31:21,315
Uh, would you rather
have permanent diarrhea

789
00:31:21,348 --> 00:31:22,550
or have penises for fingers?

790
00:31:22,584 --> 00:31:23,785
You'd have penises for fingers.

791
00:31:23,818 --> 00:31:25,319
Penis for fingers, obviously.

792
00:31:25,352 --> 00:31:27,020
Yeah, because like,
it'd be like this.

793
00:31:27,054 --> 00:31:28,523
Hey, nice to meet you.

794
00:31:28,556 --> 00:31:29,923
And then just like whoa.

795
00:31:30,825 --> 00:31:32,660
Everyone would know
how you felt all the time.

796
00:31:32,694 --> 00:31:34,395
- (laughing)
- Yeah.

797
00:31:34,428 --> 00:31:35,496
That's the only danger
'cause it's like people

798
00:31:35,530 --> 00:31:36,497
will get uncomfortable.

799
00:31:36,531 --> 00:31:39,199
Don't tread on that.

800
00:31:39,233 --> 00:31:40,501
- Okay.
- You can walk over it.

801
00:31:40,535 --> 00:31:42,670
(laughing)

802
00:31:42,704 --> 00:31:43,805
(people chattering)

803
00:31:43,838 --> 00:31:45,305
Whoa.

804
00:31:45,339 --> 00:31:46,541
Whoa.

805
00:31:46,574 --> 00:31:47,441
Holy shit.

806
00:31:48,442 --> 00:31:51,211
(people chattering)

807
00:31:51,245 --> 00:31:53,815
- People came.
- (Link sighs)

808
00:31:53,848 --> 00:31:58,051
♪ No one wants to be
the odd one out at times ♪

809
00:31:58,085 --> 00:31:59,521
♪ No one wants to be the

810
00:31:59,554 --> 00:32:01,288
All right. Let's go say hi.

811
00:32:02,456 --> 00:32:03,558
(Jake chuckles)

812
00:32:03,591 --> 00:32:04,391
Yeah.

813
00:32:04,425 --> 00:32:05,259
Do, um...

814
00:32:07,595 --> 00:32:09,229
Is that No One Special?

815
00:32:09,263 --> 00:32:12,065
Hey, it's No One Special.

816
00:32:12,099 --> 00:32:13,701
- You're even bigger in person.
- Hi.

817
00:32:13,735 --> 00:32:15,202
Hi, how are you?

818
00:32:15,235 --> 00:32:17,337
Guys, what the hell?

819
00:32:17,371 --> 00:32:19,039
(people cheering)

820
00:32:19,072 --> 00:32:20,842
We didn't expect anybody
to come.

821
00:32:20,875 --> 00:32:23,243
- Yo, yo, yo!
- (people cheering)

822
00:32:23,277 --> 00:32:24,779
This is crazy, this is crazy.

823
00:32:24,813 --> 00:32:26,681
Yo, yo, don't wake the dead.

824
00:32:26,714 --> 00:32:28,248
So seriously,
anybody who's still got a cellphone,

825
00:32:28,282 --> 00:32:30,217
put 'em on a grave
and let 'em light up

826
00:32:30,250 --> 00:32:32,554
like fireflies
all through the night.

827
00:32:32,587 --> 00:32:33,588
(people cheering)

828
00:32:33,621 --> 00:32:35,757
And then we'll just hang!

829
00:32:35,790 --> 00:32:37,224
Hey, this is all that matters

830
00:32:37,257 --> 00:32:39,259
- is that we're all here.
- (cheering)

831
00:32:39,293 --> 00:32:40,862
Oh my god.

832
00:32:40,895 --> 00:32:41,962
It's crazy how good
at this he is, huh?

833
00:32:43,330 --> 00:32:48,335
- (people chattering)
- (soft piano music)

834
00:32:55,108 --> 00:32:56,811
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no

835
00:32:56,845 --> 00:32:59,781
no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no selfies.

836
00:32:59,814 --> 00:33:01,482
Tonight this is just about us
hanging out together.

837
00:33:01,516 --> 00:33:03,250
All of us together.
How about a hug?

838
00:33:03,283 --> 00:33:05,319
Give you a hug?
Yeah, I'll give you a hug.

839
00:33:05,352 --> 00:33:07,321
Put 'em on a gravestone,
set the screen to white.

840
00:33:07,354 --> 00:33:09,056
Let the battery die out
like we said, okay?

841
00:33:09,089 --> 00:33:11,726
Get rid of them phones man.

842
00:33:11,759 --> 00:33:13,060
- (man mumbles)
- Whoa, bud.

843
00:33:13,093 --> 00:33:14,294
Yo, who's got a drink?

844
00:33:15,329 --> 00:33:16,798
(laughing)

845
00:33:16,831 --> 00:33:17,998
All right, that's good.

846
00:33:18,031 --> 00:33:19,032
Who's got something to smoke?

847
00:33:20,969 --> 00:33:25,974
- (people chattering)
- (soft piano music)

848
00:33:28,275 --> 00:33:30,244
Cheers, dad. I liked this one.

849
00:33:30,277 --> 00:33:31,546
Peach apple iced tea.

851
00:33:43,658 --> 00:33:45,292
Hello, this is Mark Schwartz.

852
00:33:45,325 --> 00:33:46,861
I hear things are really
going great down there

853
00:33:46,895 --> 00:33:49,797
at the cemetery,
which I don't often say.

854
00:33:49,831 --> 00:33:52,634
Why don't we meet at my office
Monday morning, 10:00 AM?

855
00:33:54,903 --> 00:33:56,336
Who wants that?

856
00:33:57,237 --> 00:34:02,242
- (people chattering)
- (soft piano music)

857
00:34:02,977 --> 00:34:05,680
Be right back. (grunts)

858
00:34:07,314 --> 00:34:12,319
- (people chattering)
- (soft music)

859
00:34:13,688 --> 00:34:16,189
(tense music)

860
00:34:21,896 --> 00:34:24,164
You're my little brother,
I love you.

861
00:34:24,197 --> 00:34:26,668
- Yeah, yeah.
- I just wanna talk to you.

862
00:34:26,701 --> 00:34:30,838
It's not a fuckin' ruse.
It's not a fuckin' ruse.

863
00:34:30,872 --> 00:34:32,507
Bullshit.

864
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:34,174
What the fuck?
Where are you fucking going?

865
00:34:34,207 --> 00:34:35,043
Hey!

866
00:34:36,243 --> 00:34:38,580
Where are you fucking going?

867
00:34:41,281 --> 00:34:44,052
(birds chirping)

868
00:35:13,881 --> 00:35:17,885
(car puttering in the distance)

869
00:35:28,328 --> 00:35:30,163
I was in the car with my dad.

870
00:35:33,901 --> 00:35:36,070
We hit a tree
and he died instantly.

871
00:35:39,473 --> 00:35:41,475
He was taking me
to a friend's house.

872
00:35:43,978 --> 00:35:48,983
- I wanted to go to this party.
- (melancholy music)

873
00:35:49,349 --> 00:35:51,786
(Link sighs)

874
00:36:05,867 --> 00:36:10,538
- (chattering)
- (laughing)

875
00:36:20,982 --> 00:36:23,551
(upbeat music)

876
00:36:28,488 --> 00:36:30,490
No, doesn't even work.

877
00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:34,361
That's disgusting.

878
00:36:35,228 --> 00:36:37,832
(upbeat music)

879
00:36:39,399 --> 00:36:41,669
(buzzing)

880
00:36:41,703 --> 00:36:44,539
(door buzzes)

881
00:36:44,572 --> 00:36:47,775
(upbeat music)

882
00:36:47,809 --> 00:36:49,376
Yeah, who gives a fuck
about this guy?

883
00:36:50,745 --> 00:36:53,380
Who's that guy that you were
talking to in the graveyard?

884
00:37:01,089 --> 00:37:01,889
Hey.

885
00:37:01,923 --> 00:37:03,323
Hey.

886
00:37:03,356 --> 00:37:05,993
Hey.

887
00:37:06,027 --> 00:37:06,928
- Hey
- Hey.

888
00:37:08,529 --> 00:37:10,565
(toilet flushes)

889
00:37:10,598 --> 00:37:12,166
(door closes)

890
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:14,301
These marketing assholes.
Story of my life.

891
00:37:14,334 --> 00:37:15,368
I'm on mute.
Don't worry about it.

892
00:37:15,402 --> 00:37:17,038
How are you?

893
00:37:17,071 --> 00:37:19,173
Sorry I've been on this call
for six hours.

894
00:37:19,207 --> 00:37:22,710
Hey guys. This is Mark
chiming in here again.

895
00:37:22,744 --> 00:37:25,179
$500,000 or go away.

896
00:37:25,213 --> 00:37:27,014
You've got 30 seconds
to say yes.

897
00:37:27,048 --> 00:37:28,583
Every time you don't say yes,

898
00:37:28,616 --> 00:37:30,585
it's going to go up 10 grand,
all right?

899
00:37:30,618 --> 00:37:31,853
Mute.

900
00:37:31,886 --> 00:37:32,887
I swear to God.

901
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:33,988
Um, here's a bad sign.

902
00:37:34,021 --> 00:37:35,156
We're a sports company.

903
00:37:35,189 --> 00:37:36,858
We'd like to work with you.

904
00:37:36,891 --> 00:37:38,092
Every single executive
who works with us is fat.

905
00:37:38,126 --> 00:37:39,761
Mark, we can hear you.

906
00:37:39,794 --> 00:37:40,628
Hello?

907
00:37:41,863 --> 00:37:44,297
(Link laughs)

908
00:37:45,233 --> 00:37:46,200
No One Special.

909
00:37:47,101 --> 00:37:48,603
It's a pleasure.

910
00:37:48,636 --> 00:37:50,071
I haven't seen everything,

911
00:37:50,104 --> 00:37:51,672
but what I've seen,
I really love.

912
00:37:51,706 --> 00:37:53,241
And you want to make
some money off us.

913
00:37:53,273 --> 00:37:54,742
The little I've seen,
you've changed me,

914
00:37:54,776 --> 00:37:56,043
and I think I don't want
to hoard that.

915
00:37:56,077 --> 00:37:57,245
I want everyone
to feel that way.

916
00:37:57,277 --> 00:37:58,378
Oh, okay.

917
00:37:58,411 --> 00:37:59,614
So you want us to do porn?

918
00:37:59,647 --> 00:38:00,882
No, I don't want you to do porn.

919
00:38:00,915 --> 00:38:02,784
I think he's being metaphorical

920
00:38:02,817 --> 00:38:03,918
because we don't want to put
the cart before the horse.

921
00:38:03,951 --> 00:38:05,553
Right.

922
00:38:05,586 --> 00:38:07,121
So you used another metaphor
in that metaphor

923
00:38:07,155 --> 00:38:08,523
to explain that one?

924
00:38:08,556 --> 00:38:09,857
You're a writer, right?

925
00:38:09,891 --> 00:38:10,691
- Yeah.
- Okay, good.

926
00:38:10,725 --> 00:38:11,559
Here's the deal.

927
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:13,493
You've got talent.

928
00:38:14,829 --> 00:38:16,864
Do you know where the
word talent comes from?

929
00:38:16,898 --> 00:38:18,032
It's Middle English.

930
00:38:18,065 --> 00:38:19,634
Originally talent was money.

931
00:38:19,667 --> 00:38:21,569
How many talents do you have?

932
00:38:21,602 --> 00:38:23,738
Let's say you make a video
about a gorilla

933
00:38:23,771 --> 00:38:25,740
eating spaghetti
who speaks French.

934
00:38:25,773 --> 00:38:27,608
A thousand people watch it.

935
00:38:27,642 --> 00:38:29,977
The algorithm hears that,
sends it to the powers

936
00:38:30,011 --> 00:38:32,880
that be at YouTube,
which is really not YouTube,

937
00:38:32,914 --> 00:38:34,414
it's their tube.

938
00:38:34,447 --> 00:38:36,551
They say, hey,
we see a lot of people

939
00:38:36,584 --> 00:38:38,586
are coming to you with views.

940
00:38:38,619 --> 00:38:40,487
Well, guess what?

941
00:38:40,521 --> 00:38:42,957
You qualify for a Adidas video
in front of your thing.

942
00:38:42,990 --> 00:38:44,058
Would you like to do that?

943
00:38:44,091 --> 00:38:45,827
We'll give you $10,000.

944
00:38:46,761 --> 00:38:47,562
That's great, right?

945
00:38:47,595 --> 00:38:49,396
No.

946
00:38:49,429 --> 00:38:51,666
What you want to do,
you go to the brands yourself

947
00:38:51,699 --> 00:38:54,501
or they come to you if you
are gaining enough traction

948
00:38:54,535 --> 00:38:57,572
and you aren't represented
by anything, stay yourself.

949
00:38:57,605 --> 00:38:59,841
Then Subway comes to you.
$200,000.

950
00:38:59,874 --> 00:39:02,109
That was a $200,000 sub.

951
00:39:02,143 --> 00:39:03,343
You want us to endorse brands.

952
00:39:03,376 --> 00:39:05,012
No, no, no. They endorse you.

953
00:39:05,046 --> 00:39:06,013
You don't endorse them.

954
00:39:06,047 --> 00:39:07,815
That's how we work.

955
00:39:07,849 --> 00:39:09,416
Do you want to be the guys
that made two cool videos

956
00:39:09,449 --> 00:39:11,285
and then disappeared
into the ether?

957
00:39:13,154 --> 00:39:14,956
Or do you want
to be No One Special?

958
00:39:15,790 --> 00:39:18,025
(upbeat synth pop music)

959
00:39:18,059 --> 00:39:19,994
I got you the money.
I got you the stage.

960
00:39:20,027 --> 00:39:21,762
I'm drafting you right now
into the army.

961
00:39:21,796 --> 00:39:23,430
Let's go.
Tonight we parachute in.

962
00:39:23,463 --> 00:39:24,832
Jake, you're the writer,
you need to write it.

963
00:39:24,866 --> 00:39:26,499
Link, you're gonna act it,

964
00:39:26,534 --> 00:39:28,936
and I'm gonna figure
how to fucking do it.

965
00:39:28,970 --> 00:39:32,439
So we have phone or no phone.

966
00:39:32,472 --> 00:39:34,208
That's the question.

967
00:39:34,242 --> 00:39:38,279
Then we have the idea
of a game show, a talk show.

968
00:39:38,312 --> 00:39:40,480
What if we put
those two ideas together?

969
00:39:40,514 --> 00:39:42,250
Internet killed the TV star?

970
00:39:43,317 --> 00:39:44,552
No. Bad.

971
00:39:44,585 --> 00:39:45,385
Bad idea.

972
00:39:45,418 --> 00:39:46,254
Good idea?

973
00:39:51,391 --> 00:39:54,095
(Frankie laughs)

974
00:39:56,063 --> 00:39:57,464
Oh.

975
00:39:57,497 --> 00:39:58,566
- (Jake groans)
- Oh, sorry, sorry.

976
00:39:58,599 --> 00:39:59,867
- (Jake chuckles)
- Morning.

977
00:40:02,904 --> 00:40:05,405
(Jake grunts)

978
00:40:08,175 --> 00:40:09,243
Oh, shit.

979
00:40:10,111 --> 00:40:11,078
You all right?

980
00:40:11,112 --> 00:40:11,946
Yeah.

981
00:40:14,048 --> 00:40:16,183
(Link sighs)

982
00:40:16,217 --> 00:40:17,184
Okay.

983
00:40:17,218 --> 00:40:18,052
- Bye.
- Bye.

984
00:40:19,687 --> 00:40:20,688
Bye, baby.

985
00:40:31,431 --> 00:40:32,432
You need a ride?

986
00:40:32,465 --> 00:40:34,168
No, I'm good. Thanks.

987
00:40:34,201 --> 00:40:35,236
Good work today, man.

988
00:40:40,408 --> 00:40:42,810
(Link sighs)

989
00:40:52,753 --> 00:40:54,855
I should go, too.

990
00:40:54,889 --> 00:40:55,723
Of course.

991
00:40:56,657 --> 00:40:58,192
Yeah, 'cause I gotta, you know,

992
00:40:58,225 --> 00:40:59,393
I got a big night ahead of me,
so...

993
00:40:59,427 --> 00:41:00,695
Oh yeah?

994
00:41:00,728 --> 00:41:01,562
Yeah.

995
00:41:02,763 --> 00:41:03,764
Oh yeah, that thing.

996
00:41:03,798 --> 00:41:05,132
Sorry. I forgot.

997
00:41:05,166 --> 00:41:07,234
- Oh it's a thing, so...
- Yeah.

998
00:41:07,268 --> 00:41:09,270
I wouldn't want to get in
the way of you doing a thing.

999
00:41:09,303 --> 00:41:10,137
Yeah.

1000
00:41:12,406 --> 00:41:13,574
Mhm.

1001
00:41:13,607 --> 00:41:15,276
That's what I love about you,

1002
00:41:15,309 --> 00:41:16,610
is that you really support me
doing my thing.

1003
00:41:23,184 --> 00:41:25,052
I think you're cool.

1004
00:41:25,086 --> 00:41:26,620

Pow.

1022
00:42:31,919 --> 00:42:35,423
(Frankie exhales shakily)

1023
00:42:37,858 --> 00:42:39,060
Hey.

1024
00:42:39,093 --> 00:42:39,894
- (laughing)
- Here we go.

1025
00:42:39,927 --> 00:42:41,695
Here we go.

1026
00:42:41,729 --> 00:42:43,064
Did you make those changes
on the mouse trap scene?

1027
00:42:43,097 --> 00:42:44,865
No, we cut that, remember?

1028
00:42:44,899 --> 00:42:46,667
We're gonna do the
greenhouse gases bit instead?

1029
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:48,836
No, Jake, greenhouse is cut
and mouse traps is in.

1030
00:42:48,869 --> 00:42:50,805
Wait, what?

1031
00:42:50,838 --> 00:42:52,039
What? No, we have to have
those moments that are serious-

1032
00:42:52,073 --> 00:42:53,407
We like moustraps better.

1033
00:42:53,441 --> 00:42:54,875
- We have so many goofy-
- Look.

1034
00:42:54,909 --> 00:42:56,143
- Boo!
- The show-

1035
00:42:56,177 --> 00:42:58,012
- Oh.
- Jesus Christ, man.

1036
00:42:58,045 --> 00:42:59,680
Hey, you're gonna stay on
like the whole time, right?

1037
00:42:59,713 --> 00:43:00,748
Just keep focused on him.

1038
00:43:00,781 --> 00:43:02,383
Here we go. Here we go.

1039
00:43:02,416 --> 00:43:03,552
Oh, you guys
have never done this before.

1040
00:43:03,584 --> 00:43:04,752
- How you doin'?
- Oh.

1041
00:43:04,785 --> 00:43:06,353
Good.

1042
00:43:06,387 --> 00:43:07,188
(Frankie exhales sharply)

1043
00:43:07,221 --> 00:43:08,222
Hey.

1044
00:43:08,255 --> 00:43:09,723
Hey, I need to uh...

1045
00:43:10,758 --> 00:43:13,194
I...

1046
00:43:13,227 --> 00:43:14,529
I don't know if I can do this.

1047
00:43:14,563 --> 00:43:16,163
You're going to be great, man.

1048
00:43:16,197 --> 00:43:17,031
Don't worry about it.
Don't overthink it.

1049
00:43:17,064 --> 00:43:18,732
Just breathe.

1050
00:43:18,766 --> 00:43:19,600
No, you've got to be dumb
to be smart, right?

1051
00:43:19,633 --> 00:43:21,368
Go be dumb.

1052
00:43:21,402 --> 00:43:23,838
If we do this,
you know there's no going back.

1053
00:43:23,871 --> 00:43:25,039
Who wants to go back?

1054
00:43:25,072 --> 00:43:26,440
Showtime.
(claps)

1055
00:43:26,474 --> 00:43:27,308
Let's do it.

1056
00:43:28,742 --> 00:43:31,979
(Link exhales sharply)

1057
00:43:33,614 --> 00:43:36,450
(exhales sharply)

1058
00:43:46,627 --> 00:43:47,562
(exhales sharply)

1059
00:43:47,596 --> 00:43:49,497
And action.

1060
00:43:50,464 --> 00:43:54,536
(upbeat game show music)

1061
00:43:54,569 --> 00:43:58,372
- (cheering)
- (clapping)

1062
00:43:58,405 --> 00:44:01,809
(upbeat game show music)

1063
00:44:05,980 --> 00:44:08,048
(laughing)

1064
00:44:08,082 --> 00:44:11,485
(upbeat game show music)

1065
00:44:19,827 --> 00:44:21,896
(taps)

1066
00:44:21,929 --> 00:44:24,999
Thank you, severed hand.
(laughs)

1067
00:44:25,032 --> 00:44:28,135
What a response.
Give a hand to the hand.

1068
00:44:28,169 --> 00:44:30,004
(laughs)

1069
00:44:30,037 --> 00:44:31,573
I'm your host and I'm,
you know, I'm No One Special.

1070
00:44:31,606 --> 00:44:32,740
And are you all um...

1071
00:44:32,773 --> 00:44:34,643
(audio glitching)

1072
00:44:34,675 --> 00:44:36,210
You're all sitting comfortably?

1073
00:44:37,044 --> 00:44:39,180
And when you all came
into the studio today,

1074
00:44:39,213 --> 00:44:41,015
- (fly buzzing)
- you were asked to

1075
00:44:41,048 --> 00:44:43,083
hand over your cell phones
and sign some, some uh,

1076
00:44:43,117 --> 00:44:44,586
- some kind of waivers.
- (thunder rumbles)

1077
00:44:44,619 --> 00:44:46,521
Hey, severed hand is back.

1078
00:44:46,555 --> 00:44:48,322
I hope you read
the small print, folks,

1079
00:44:48,355 --> 00:44:50,491
'cause you've just signed
your phones over to me.

1080
00:44:50,525 --> 00:44:51,358
Oh.

1081
00:44:52,393 --> 00:44:55,129
The atmosphere
is suddenly so tense.

1082
00:44:55,162 --> 00:44:57,097
Can you feel it at home, kids?

1083
00:44:57,131 --> 00:45:02,136
As we play Your Phone
or Your Dignity? (laughs)

1084
00:45:05,406 --> 00:45:08,677
(upbeat game show music)

1085
00:45:08,709 --> 00:45:10,177
Sorry.

1086
00:45:10,211 --> 00:45:11,779
- I don't remember.
- (cheering)

1087
00:45:11,812 --> 00:45:13,147
Am I going here?
Where am I going, Candice?

1088
00:45:13,180 --> 00:45:14,315
Over there?

1089
00:45:14,348 --> 00:45:15,382
Candice told me to go here.

1090
00:45:15,416 --> 00:45:16,651
I don't even know.

1091
00:45:16,685 --> 00:45:17,918
Let's see who we got. Hi.

1092
00:45:19,353 --> 00:45:20,354
(upbeat game show music)

1093
00:45:20,387 --> 00:45:21,556
Everybody's miserable.

1094
00:45:21,590 --> 00:45:23,190
Everybody's so sad.

1095
00:45:23,224 --> 00:45:24,358
Why is everyone so...

1096
00:45:24,391 --> 00:45:25,826
It's a game show. It's fun.

1097
00:45:25,859 --> 00:45:27,494
Excuse me. Let me squeeze.

1098
00:45:27,529 --> 00:45:29,730
Bring the music, music down.
We can't hear.

1099
00:45:29,763 --> 00:45:30,864
Cut the music!

1100
00:45:30,898 --> 00:45:32,567
That's the cue to cut the-

1101
00:45:32,601 --> 00:45:33,635
So sir, what's your name?
Where are you from?

1102
00:45:33,668 --> 00:45:34,802
Um, my name is Martin.

1103
00:45:34,835 --> 00:45:35,970
I'm from Temecula.

1104
00:45:36,003 --> 00:45:37,572
Beautiful name, beautiful place.

1105
00:45:37,606 --> 00:45:39,039
God's country.
Had an aunt from Temecula.

1106
00:45:39,073 --> 00:45:40,407
You want to feel my carpet?

1107
00:45:41,408 --> 00:45:42,209
Um...

1108
00:45:42,243 --> 00:45:43,244
Yeah you do!

1109
00:45:43,277 --> 00:45:44,512
Let's go.

1110
00:45:44,546 --> 00:45:46,080
Here we are, me and Martin.

1111
00:45:50,751 --> 00:45:52,319
Come on, feel it.

1112
00:45:52,353 --> 00:45:53,854
You wanna lay on it?

1113
00:45:53,887 --> 00:45:54,888
Oh, sure.

1114
00:45:56,123 --> 00:45:57,559
How does that feel?

1115
00:45:57,592 --> 00:45:59,226
It feels like just great,
smooth.

1116
00:45:59,260 --> 00:46:00,094
Smooth ass carpet.

1117
00:46:00,127 --> 00:46:01,696
Smooth carpet.

1118
00:46:01,730 --> 00:46:03,397
All right,
enough fooling around folks.

1119
00:46:03,430 --> 00:46:05,099
Let's get on with the show.

1120
00:46:05,132 --> 00:46:06,668
(panting)

1121
00:46:06,701 --> 00:46:08,168
One simple question for you,
Martin.

1122
00:46:08,202 --> 00:46:10,705
How badly do you need
your phone?

1123
00:46:11,573 --> 00:46:14,875
Um, I mean, yeah,
I use it all the time.

1124
00:46:14,908 --> 00:46:16,343
Right. Don't we all?

1125
00:46:16,377 --> 00:46:19,079
Well, Martin,
it is your lucky day

1126
00:46:19,113 --> 00:46:23,917
because you get to walk away
with $100

1127
00:46:23,951 --> 00:46:26,820
and one of these
brand spanking new devices.

1128
00:46:28,889 --> 00:46:31,425
These phones come with
no camera and no internet

1129
00:46:31,458 --> 00:46:34,428
which means freedom from self
obsession and social media.

1130
00:46:34,461 --> 00:46:36,598
What a prize, am I right?

1131
00:46:38,999 --> 00:46:42,403
Or, Martin, you can complete
one of our challenges

1132
00:46:42,436 --> 00:46:47,642
to retrieve your old, needy,
soul sucking phone.

1133
00:46:47,676 --> 00:46:49,276
It was like 800 bucks.

1134
00:46:49,310 --> 00:46:50,811
Yeah, I need it.
I use it all the time.

1135
00:46:50,844 --> 00:46:52,413
Well if you want
your phone back, Martin,

1136
00:46:52,446 --> 00:46:55,382
you're going to have to
wrestle this guy for it.

1137
00:46:55,416 --> 00:46:57,117
Come and get your phone, Martin.

1138
00:46:59,186 --> 00:47:00,020
Chee-hoo!

1139
00:47:00,988 --> 00:47:01,822
Ah!

1140
00:47:03,591 --> 00:47:04,925
I'm backing you, Martin.

1141
00:47:06,661 --> 00:47:07,995
Yes.

1142
00:47:08,028 --> 00:47:08,996
(Martin grunts)

1143
00:47:09,029 --> 00:47:09,997
Oh come on, Martin.

1144
00:47:10,030 --> 00:47:11,131
You're better than this.

1145
00:47:11,165 --> 00:47:12,266
(Martin grunting)

1146
00:47:12,299 --> 00:47:13,768
Isn't he doing great?

1147
00:47:13,802 --> 00:47:16,270
(wrestler grunts)

1148
00:47:16,303 --> 00:47:18,005
(Martin yells)

1149
00:47:18,038 --> 00:47:19,808
And, ah, he's got it.

1150
00:47:20,675 --> 00:47:23,977
Give it up for Martin
from Temecula, I guess.

1151
00:47:24,011 --> 00:47:25,179
I got my phone.

1152
00:47:25,212 --> 00:47:27,081
He got his phone back.

1153
00:47:27,114 --> 00:47:30,785
Welcome to the rest
of your life, Martin.

1154
00:47:30,819 --> 00:47:34,221
(upbeat game show music)

1155
00:47:43,631 --> 00:47:46,367
I'm Charles Melton and I'm
here with No One Special.

1156
00:47:48,168 --> 00:47:50,137
We're about to destroy
Chuck's phone.

1157
00:47:55,042 --> 00:47:55,844
(hits)

1158
00:47:55,876 --> 00:47:57,978
(cheering)

1159
00:47:58,011 --> 00:47:59,480
- Woo!
- Got it!

1160
00:47:59,514 --> 00:48:02,483
Chuck M killed it.
No One Special.

1161
00:48:02,517 --> 00:48:03,384
Stay tuned.

1162
00:48:03,417 --> 00:48:05,386
NoOneSpecial.com.

1163
00:48:05,419 --> 00:48:06,253
Peace!

I just wanted to say I'm sorry

1211
00:50:31,331 --> 00:50:33,133
that we're not doing
the twinning politicians thing.

1212
00:50:33,166 --> 00:50:34,301
Yeah. Okay, sure.

1213
00:50:37,371 --> 00:50:38,706
You know I see you, right?

1214
00:50:40,374 --> 00:50:41,843
You see me?

1215
00:50:41,876 --> 00:50:43,377
I see you flirting
with that girl.

1216
00:50:43,410 --> 00:50:44,244
I see you.

1217
00:50:47,381 --> 00:50:49,082
You call that flirting? Well...

1218
00:50:49,984 --> 00:50:51,151
Yeah.

1219
00:50:51,184 --> 00:50:52,787
Oh no, I'll show you flirting.

1220
00:50:52,820 --> 00:50:54,656
I'll take you to the back room
right now.

1221
00:50:54,689 --> 00:50:56,323
Thought you've taken
enough people to the back room.

1222
00:50:59,761 --> 00:51:00,595
Don't hurt her.

1223
00:51:03,230 --> 00:51:05,833
(Link laughs)

1224
00:51:05,867 --> 00:51:08,435
I love that, Jake. I love it.

1225
00:51:09,369 --> 00:51:11,639
Eh uh, how else can I say it?

1226
00:51:11,673 --> 00:51:14,308
I'm just,
I'm getting a little antsy.

1227
00:51:14,341 --> 00:51:15,877
But I don't understand,
antsy about what?

1228
00:51:15,910 --> 00:51:17,477
Specifically what's going wrong?

1229
00:51:17,512 --> 00:51:18,913
It's not a nosedive.

1230
00:51:18,947 --> 00:51:21,683
It's more like, um,
like a little,

1231
00:51:21,716 --> 00:51:23,083
like a little, um...

1232
00:51:23,116 --> 00:51:24,819
Just spit it out, Mark.

1233
00:51:24,852 --> 00:51:26,888
We're down about 15%
since the last episode.

1234
00:51:26,921 --> 00:51:29,156
If you don't do something,
you will lose more.

1235
00:51:29,189 --> 00:51:30,658
It's science.

1236
00:51:30,692 --> 00:51:31,826
Just shake it up.

1237
00:51:31,859 --> 00:51:32,860
Get people interested again.

1238
00:51:32,894 --> 00:51:33,928
Get 'em back up.

1239
00:51:33,962 --> 00:51:35,063
It all corrects itself.

1240
00:51:35,095 --> 00:51:36,030
Yes. Yes.

1241
00:51:36,064 --> 00:51:37,599
I'm busting my ass

1242
00:51:37,632 --> 00:51:39,867
and you're writing
the same old tired shit.

1243
00:51:39,901 --> 00:51:41,836
I've been saying that for weeks.

1244
00:51:41,869 --> 00:51:43,037
You guys told me that I had
to stick to the formula.

1245
00:51:43,071 --> 00:51:44,505
It was working, now it's not.

1246
00:51:44,539 --> 00:51:46,406
We're all clear
it's not Jake's fault.

1247
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:48,375
I wrote the greenhouse gases
bit and then that got cut.

1248
00:51:48,408 --> 00:51:50,578
Yeah, 'cause climate change
isn't sexy right now, Jake.

1249
00:51:50,612 --> 00:51:52,179
I'm sorry.
Climate change isn't sexy?

1250
00:51:52,212 --> 00:51:54,348
Are you out of your mind?

1251
00:51:54,381 --> 00:51:55,750
I didn't know the end of the
world is supposed to be sexy.

1252
00:51:55,783 --> 00:51:57,250
Can you take the cotton
out of your ears

1253
00:51:57,284 --> 00:51:58,251
and put it in your mouth
for one second

1254
00:51:58,285 --> 00:52:00,021
and listen to Mark?

1255
00:52:00,054 --> 00:52:01,556
We're losing views
and we need to get them back up,

1256
00:52:01,589 --> 00:52:02,624
so we need to write stuff
that's new,

1257
00:52:02,657 --> 00:52:04,224
not cliche, not boring.

1258
00:52:04,257 --> 00:52:05,760
Well it won't be boring
when the polar bears

1259
00:52:05,793 --> 00:52:07,227
are scratching
at our front door because

1260
00:52:07,260 --> 00:52:08,863
- their habitats are melted.
- Fuck.

1261
00:52:08,896 --> 00:52:09,897
And it won't be boring
when we don't have

1262
00:52:09,931 --> 00:52:11,599
any clean water to drink.

1263
00:52:11,633 --> 00:52:13,266
We need to get
Jake's soapbox in here, guys.

1264
00:52:13,300 --> 00:52:14,134
Get the viewers back up
before we lose anymore.

1265
00:52:14,167 --> 00:52:15,870
It's very simple.

1266
00:52:15,903 --> 00:52:17,437
Come up with something amazing
and new, now.

1267
00:52:17,471 --> 00:52:18,940
I know you hate me.

1268
00:52:18,973 --> 00:52:20,775
You're going to love me soon.
Trust me.

1269
00:52:20,808 --> 00:52:23,410
Welcome to fuckin' life, baby.

1270
00:52:25,312 --> 00:52:26,446
Where's the chocolate?

1271
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:27,280
Are you too high and mighty?

1272
00:52:27,314 --> 00:52:28,448
Mm, yeah.

1273
00:52:28,482 --> 00:52:29,917
And you know what a fuckin'

1274
00:52:29,951 --> 00:52:30,585
hungry polar bear
will really do?

1275
00:52:30,618 --> 00:52:31,819
Eat you.

1276
00:52:31,853 --> 00:52:33,153
It will eat you.

1277
00:52:33,186 --> 00:52:34,989
You can love it from here.

1278
00:52:35,023 --> 00:52:36,256
Let me tell you,
if you ever met a real polar bear,

1279
00:52:36,289 --> 00:52:38,126
they would fuckin' eat you.

1280
00:52:38,158 --> 00:52:40,227
(synth music)

1281
00:52:40,260 --> 00:52:41,996
I got an idea.

1282
00:52:42,030 --> 00:52:45,099
What if we shifted
the way people behave online?

1283
00:52:45,133 --> 00:52:46,934
Not trying to take away
the phone,

1284
00:52:46,968 --> 00:52:49,671
but trying to put the soul back
into the phone?

1285
00:52:53,875 --> 00:52:57,512
(audience applause)

1286
00:52:57,545 --> 00:52:59,580
What do you say we shake it up
a little bit, folks?

1287
00:52:59,614 --> 00:53:01,448
There's someone I'm looking for.

1288
00:53:01,481 --> 00:53:02,382
There's someone...

1289
00:53:03,383 --> 00:53:05,687
Do we have an Isabelle Roberts?

1290
00:53:05,720 --> 00:53:06,621
Isabelle Roberts?

1291
00:53:06,654 --> 00:53:08,355
Yes?

1292
00:53:08,388 --> 00:53:10,024
Okay, and bring around
the camera on Isabelle.

1293
00:53:10,058 --> 00:53:11,125
Sweetheart,
what are you waiting for?

1294
00:53:11,159 --> 00:53:12,694
Destiny awaits!

1295
00:53:12,727 --> 00:53:14,996
I don't know about this.

1296
00:53:15,029 --> 00:53:18,866
Yeah, you made that very clear
in the room.

1297
00:53:18,900 --> 00:53:20,768
Let's let it play out.

1298
00:53:20,802 --> 00:53:21,703
Isabelle.

1299
00:53:23,004 --> 00:53:24,072
That's sexy.

1300
00:53:26,074 --> 00:53:27,508
Hi.

1301
00:53:27,542 --> 00:53:29,309
So Isabelle,
my source is telling me,

1302
00:53:29,342 --> 00:53:31,112
you mind if I lean on you?

1303
00:53:31,145 --> 00:53:33,548
My source is telling me
you're a big fan of Instagram,

1304
00:53:33,581 --> 00:53:35,282
- is that right?
- Mhm.

1305
00:53:35,315 --> 00:53:37,250
Okay. So let's have a look
at your best shot.

1306
00:53:38,886 --> 00:53:39,987
- Yeah.
- Whoa!

1307
00:53:40,021 --> 00:53:41,155
- Beautiful.
- What?

1308
00:53:41,189 --> 00:53:43,624
(clapping)

1309
00:53:43,658 --> 00:53:45,225
You gotta warn me next time

1310
00:53:45,258 --> 00:53:46,060
there's gonna be a supermodel
in the room.

1311
00:53:46,094 --> 00:53:47,995
Here we go.

1312
00:53:48,029 --> 00:53:49,664
What's your secret, Isabelle,
for looking so damn fresh?

1313
00:53:50,765 --> 00:53:52,466
(chuckles)

1314
00:53:52,499 --> 00:53:54,234
I don't, I don't know.

1315
00:53:54,267 --> 00:53:57,171
I drink a lot of water,
I guess, and try to eat well.

1316
00:53:57,205 --> 00:53:58,673
Well, let's have a look
at the original version

1317
00:53:58,706 --> 00:53:59,674
of the photo we found
on your phone.

1318
00:53:59,707 --> 00:54:00,541
No, no...

1319
00:54:01,709 --> 00:54:05,146
(soft, tense tinkling music)

1320
00:54:05,179 --> 00:54:07,148
(audience exclaims)
Oh.

1321
00:54:07,181 --> 00:54:11,919
- (audience members chattering)
- (soft, tense tinkling music)

1322
00:54:13,955 --> 00:54:15,422
Did you know
that she had a birthmark?

1323
00:54:15,455 --> 00:54:16,289
That's a...

1324
00:54:19,727 --> 00:54:20,528
It's a birthmark.

1325
00:54:20,561 --> 00:54:21,394
Well...

1326
00:54:22,429 --> 00:54:23,263
Yeah.

1327
00:54:24,364 --> 00:54:28,603
Well I don't, I don't see it...

1328
00:54:28,636 --> 00:54:30,238
I don't see it now.

1329
00:54:32,774 --> 00:54:34,008
I have my makeup on.

1330
00:54:34,041 --> 00:54:35,009
Oh, of course.

1331
00:54:35,042 --> 00:54:37,078
Well, you know what?

1332
00:54:37,111 --> 00:54:38,179
I think that's just another
beautiful part of yourself.

1333
00:54:38,212 --> 00:54:39,446
What do you guys think?

1334
00:54:39,479 --> 00:54:40,681
Yeah!

1335
00:54:40,715 --> 00:54:41,682
(clapping)

1336
00:54:41,716 --> 00:54:45,019
Proud. She's proud.

1337
00:54:45,052 --> 00:54:46,754
Tell me something,
how many likes do you think

1338
00:54:46,788 --> 00:54:48,556
this version of the photo
would get?

1339
00:54:48,589 --> 00:54:51,192
Uh, I would, I would never...

1340
00:54:51,225 --> 00:54:53,127
I wouldn't.

1341
00:54:53,161 --> 00:54:55,295
Are you prepared to let
the world see the real you?

1342
00:54:56,998 --> 00:54:58,699
What do you mean?

1343
00:54:58,733 --> 00:54:59,734
You're not gonna...

1344
00:54:59,767 --> 00:55:01,301
Oh no, no, no, no, no.

1345
00:55:01,334 --> 00:55:02,937
No, no, I'm not.
I'm not gonna do anything.

1346
00:55:03,971 --> 00:55:04,806
You are.

1347
00:55:06,073 --> 00:55:09,811
(soft, tense tinkling music)

1348
00:55:12,246 --> 00:55:13,080
Isabelle.

1349
00:55:14,447 --> 00:55:16,818
(soft, tense tinkling music)

1350
00:55:16,851 --> 00:55:18,451
If you hit this button,

1351
00:55:18,485 --> 00:55:20,054
the original version
of this photo

1352
00:55:20,087 --> 00:55:22,089
will be sent out
to all your followers

1353
00:55:22,123 --> 00:55:23,825
with the hashtag the real me,

1354
00:55:23,858 --> 00:55:27,494
and you'll walk away
with $400 and your phone

1355
00:55:27,528 --> 00:55:30,998
and a tremendous amount
of self-respect and liberation.

1356
00:55:31,032 --> 00:55:33,267
So what should she do audience?

1357
00:55:33,301 --> 00:55:35,837
- Does she press the button?
- (audience applause)

1358
00:55:35,870 --> 00:55:38,606
Um, will you just mostly
stay on the wide for now?

1359
00:55:38,639 --> 00:55:40,007
Thank you.

1360
00:55:40,041 --> 00:55:43,511
- (audience clapping)
- (cheering)

1361
00:55:43,544 --> 00:55:46,346
I mean, it's pretty clear
what they want,

1362
00:55:46,379 --> 00:55:47,515
but it's up to you, Isabelle.

1363
00:55:47,548 --> 00:55:48,950
So what's it gonna be?

1364
00:55:48,983 --> 00:55:50,952
Your phone or your vanity?

1365
00:55:53,688 --> 00:55:55,323
I can't, I can't.

1366
00:55:55,355 --> 00:55:57,024
This is the best.

1367
00:55:57,058 --> 00:55:58,192
Everyone in the audience
can see it.

1368
00:55:58,226 --> 00:56:00,094
What are you afraid of, darling?

1369
00:56:00,127 --> 00:56:02,530
That these people at home
will think that you're ugly,

1370
00:56:02,563 --> 00:56:03,998
that they'll think
you're rejectable?

1371
00:56:04,031 --> 00:56:05,465
That they'll think
you're unlovable?

1372
00:56:05,498 --> 00:56:08,435
We are in trouble, folks. Woo.

1373
00:56:08,468 --> 00:56:12,540
We got innocent,
pure angels who have

1374
00:56:12,573 --> 00:56:14,441
somehow been brainwashed.

1375
00:56:14,474 --> 00:56:16,711
We are disfiguring ourselves.

1376
00:56:17,578 --> 00:56:21,182
Taking needles,
shoving them in our faces.

1377
00:56:21,215 --> 00:56:22,617
They're taking our chins
and they're

1378
00:56:22,650 --> 00:56:23,985
putting them in our asses.

1379
00:56:25,052 --> 00:56:27,321
You're saving polar bears
right now, Jake.

1380
00:56:27,355 --> 00:56:28,356
Okay, come on.

1381
00:56:29,824 --> 00:56:31,325
Stop it.

1382
00:56:31,359 --> 00:56:33,127
- Are you gonna stop this.
- Look, it could

1383
00:56:33,160 --> 00:56:34,862
- be really powerful.
- No, are you gonna stop this?

1384
00:56:34,896 --> 00:56:35,897
- Look at her face.
- It could be really powerful.

1385
00:56:35,930 --> 00:56:37,531
Let it cook, let it cook.

1386
00:56:37,565 --> 00:56:39,200
Are we going insane?
Are we going crazy?

1387
00:56:39,233 --> 00:56:41,636
I feel like I'm going crazy
every damn day.

1388
00:56:41,669 --> 00:56:42,837
She's cracking.

1389
00:56:42,870 --> 00:56:44,805
You can't stop 'em mid crack.

1390
00:56:44,839 --> 00:56:46,073
That's what they're doing,
Isabelle,

1391
00:56:46,107 --> 00:56:47,708
that's what they've done to you.

1392
00:56:48,609 --> 00:56:50,578
I can't watch,
but I can't stop watching.

1393
00:56:50,611 --> 00:56:53,147
Are we going to take
this shit anymore?

1394
00:56:53,180 --> 00:56:54,015
No!

1395
00:56:55,549 --> 00:56:58,219
Is Isabelle going to
take this shit anymore?

1396
00:56:58,252 --> 00:56:59,687
No!

1397
00:57:01,088 --> 00:57:03,357
You got to lead
the revolution, Isabelle,

1398
00:57:03,391 --> 00:57:05,425
and it's oh so simple.

1399
00:57:05,458 --> 00:57:10,131
All you must do
is hit that button.

1400
00:57:11,431 --> 00:57:13,000
Look at her face.

1401
00:57:13,034 --> 00:57:15,169
You're not gonna stop this?

1402
00:57:15,202 --> 00:57:16,938
We're stopping nothing,
my friend.

1403
00:57:18,873 --> 00:57:19,974
I'm gonna stop this.

1404
00:57:22,610 --> 00:57:24,078
What are we stopping?

1405
00:57:24,111 --> 00:57:25,613
This? No, no, no, no.

1406
00:57:25,646 --> 00:57:27,014
- (Isabelle sobbing)
- Stop crying.

1407
00:57:27,048 --> 00:57:28,950
Stop crying right now.

1408
00:57:28,983 --> 00:57:32,987
That's all you must do to
lead the revolution, Isabelle.

1409
00:57:34,822 --> 00:57:36,123
(buzzing)

1410
00:57:36,157 --> 00:57:41,362
- (cheering)
- (upbeat music)

1411
00:57:41,395 --> 00:57:42,930
She did it, folks!

1412
00:57:42,964 --> 00:57:45,399
We're free now! And I'm free!

1413
00:57:47,435 --> 00:57:48,402
Stop crying.

1414
00:57:48,436 --> 00:57:49,804
Grow up.

1415
00:57:49,837 --> 00:57:53,040
Stop your fucking crying
right now.

1416
00:57:53,074 --> 00:57:54,108
Don't do this to me.

1417
00:57:54,141 --> 00:57:55,042
Don't ruin this for me.

1418
00:57:55,076 --> 00:57:55,910
Pull it together.

1419
00:57:55,943 --> 00:57:57,311
Just stop it.

1420
00:57:57,345 --> 00:57:58,312
- Hey, back up.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1421
00:57:58,346 --> 00:57:59,880
Hey. You all right?

1422
00:57:59,914 --> 00:58:00,715
- I got it, I got it.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1423
00:58:00,748 --> 00:58:02,049
She's great.

1424
00:58:02,083 --> 00:58:03,551
- She's great.
- I'm so sorry.

1425
00:58:03,584 --> 00:58:04,585
I'm really, really sorry,
all right?

1426
00:58:04,618 --> 00:58:06,087
That wasn't scripted.

1427
00:58:06,120 --> 00:58:07,555
You can't treat people
like that, okay?

1428
00:58:07,588 --> 00:58:08,756
I told you
you couldn't go there.

1429
00:58:08,789 --> 00:58:10,291
And I hope that you understand

1430
00:58:10,324 --> 00:58:11,993
that we're going to
make it up to you.

1431
00:58:12,026 --> 00:58:13,160
Do you want to get up here
and give it a try?

1432
00:58:13,194 --> 00:58:14,095
- Guys.
- Come here, baby.

1433
00:58:14,128 --> 00:58:15,830
Give me a kiss.

1434
00:58:15,863 --> 00:58:17,431
- You're a straight-up psychopath.
- Jake!

1435
00:58:17,465 --> 00:58:19,100
Back off, back off,
back off, back off.

1436
00:58:19,133 --> 00:58:20,500
- You're a psychopath.
- Jake, you gotta stop.

1437
00:58:20,534 --> 00:58:22,169
- You're outta line.
- I'm outta line?

1438
00:58:22,203 --> 00:58:23,738
- Jake you gotta stop.
- That was out of line!

1439
00:58:23,771 --> 00:58:24,972
- That was out line.
- Please calm down,

1440
00:58:25,006 --> 00:58:26,841
- please calm down.
- Yeah.

1441
00:58:26,874 --> 00:58:28,576
This is our head writer, Jake,
ladies and gentlemen.

1442
00:58:28,609 --> 00:58:29,777
He's having some kind
of a nervous breakdown.

1443
00:58:29,810 --> 00:58:31,645
- Hey, hey, hey!
- Stop.

1444
00:58:31,679 --> 00:58:32,313
- This is fucking bullshit.
- Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye.

1445
00:58:32,346 --> 00:58:33,781
Goodbye.

1446
00:58:33,814 --> 00:58:35,449
Can you give them
a helping hand?

1447
00:58:35,483 --> 00:58:37,018
- Give him a little hand, folks.
- (clapping)

1448
00:58:37,051 --> 00:58:38,586
- Jake, please, okay.
- This is ridiculous.

1449
00:58:38,619 --> 00:58:39,820
- This is the same-
- Please, calm down.

1450
00:58:39,854 --> 00:58:41,088
Please, let's go talk about it.

1451
00:58:41,122 --> 00:58:42,123
- Please.
- Jake, goodbye, goodbye.

1452
00:58:42,156 --> 00:58:43,157
Take care of yourself.

1453
00:58:43,190 --> 00:58:44,959
Get better soon. Wow.

1454
00:58:44,992 --> 00:58:46,527
You think you know somebody,
and then you don't.

1455
00:58:46,560 --> 00:58:47,661
Jake. Jake.
Jake, you have to calm down.

1456
00:58:47,695 --> 00:58:48,596
He was bullying that girl.

1457
00:58:48,629 --> 00:58:49,497
No, she's fine.

1458
00:58:49,530 --> 00:58:51,265
I spoke to her.

1459
00:58:51,298 --> 00:58:52,767
- We're gonna edit around it.
- No, she's not fine.

1460
00:58:52,800 --> 00:58:54,502
She's sobbing
on the side of the stage.

1461
00:58:54,535 --> 00:58:55,369
Look, he was trying
something new for the show.

1462
00:58:55,403 --> 00:58:56,537
Fuck the show.

1463
00:58:56,570 --> 00:58:57,705
Who cares about the stupid show?

1464
00:58:57,738 --> 00:58:58,873
I do. I care about the show.

1465
00:58:58,906 --> 00:59:00,341
I cared about the show too,

1466
00:59:00,374 --> 00:59:01,510
when we were satirizing
awful people.

1467
00:59:01,542 --> 00:59:03,344
Now we are the awful people.

1468
00:59:03,377 --> 00:59:04,779
I want you to wake up
'cause you're getting swept up

1469
00:59:04,812 --> 00:59:06,380
in this bullshit
and you'd see it

1470
00:59:06,414 --> 00:59:08,616
if you weren't busy
slutting around with him.

1471
00:59:08,649 --> 00:59:11,352
You're so jealous of him,
it's pathetic.

1472
00:59:11,385 --> 00:59:12,720
(Jake sighs)

1473
00:59:12,753 --> 00:59:13,587
I quit.

1474
00:59:15,089 --> 00:59:18,025
(soft synth music)

1475
00:59:20,928 --> 00:59:23,364
(door slams)

1476
00:59:24,331 --> 00:59:27,234
(soft piano music)

1477
00:59:29,670 --> 00:59:30,871
[Luke]
<i>But it's up to you.</i>

1478
00:59:30,905 --> 00:59:32,706
<i>The choice is ultimately yours.</i>

1479
00:59:32,740 --> 00:59:33,974
What's it gonna be, Isabelle?

1480
00:59:34,008 --> 00:59:36,243
Your phone, or your vanity?

1481
00:59:37,078 --> 00:59:39,847
(clock ticking)

1482
00:59:44,251 --> 00:59:45,386
What's it going to be Isabelle?

1483
00:59:45,419 --> 00:59:47,922
Your phone, or your vanity?

1484
00:59:47,955 --> 00:59:49,590
(clock ticking)

1485
00:59:49,623 --> 00:59:54,628
- (audience cheering)
- (clapping)

1486
00:59:58,432 --> 01:00:01,202
(soft, melancholy music)

1487
01:00:01,235 --> 01:00:02,069
Who am I?

1488
01:00:07,374 --> 01:00:08,543
I'm worthless.

1489
01:00:13,614 --> 01:00:14,782
I hate myself.

1490
01:00:19,320 --> 01:00:20,621
I'm No One Special.

1491
01:00:22,790 --> 01:00:25,226
(soft music)

1492
01:00:35,736 --> 01:00:36,571
Cut.

1493
01:00:38,472 --> 01:00:39,807
That was great.

1494
01:00:39,840 --> 01:00:41,442
(slaps)

1495
01:00:41,475 --> 01:00:42,710
- We got it.
- All right, well done.

1496
01:00:42,743 --> 01:00:43,578
Good work guys.

1497
01:00:43,612 --> 01:00:45,079
Oh, thank you.

1498
01:00:45,112 --> 01:00:46,914
Uh, you guys can pack up
and head home.

1499
01:00:46,947 --> 01:00:48,550
Thank you for a great day.

1500
01:00:48,583 --> 01:00:50,484
Hey, yo, guys we got
the No One Special hats,

1501
01:00:50,519 --> 01:00:52,587
the t-shirts,
and the baseball caps came in,

1502
01:00:52,621 --> 01:00:54,589
so Mark has one for each of you,

1503
01:00:54,623 --> 01:00:55,990
and take some for the family,
for the friends, and all that.

1504
01:00:56,023 --> 01:00:57,124
We love you guys.

1505
01:00:57,158 --> 01:00:58,726
And great work. Thank you.

1506
01:00:58,759 --> 01:01:01,996
Okay, you think you can
get that up by tomorrow?

1507
01:01:02,029 --> 01:01:03,063
Yeah.

1508
01:01:03,097 --> 01:01:04,131
I can edit it tonight.

1509
01:01:04,165 --> 01:01:06,568
Mhm.

1510
01:01:06,601 --> 01:01:08,269
That's gonna work.

1511
01:01:08,302 --> 01:01:09,737
Hashtag real me,
we're gonna get the views back,

1512
01:01:09,770 --> 01:01:11,772
and what you did
with that Isabelle video

1513
01:01:11,805 --> 01:01:13,407
and you cut around
all of her crying.

1514
01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:15,943
It was, it's just like,
you're like a wizard.

1515
01:01:15,976 --> 01:01:17,811
It was just like mwah.

1516
01:01:17,845 --> 01:01:19,480
It was just perfection.

1517
01:01:19,514 --> 01:01:21,583
It's like so fuckin' tight.

1518
01:01:21,616 --> 01:01:22,716
That's too much, right?

1519
01:01:23,652 --> 01:01:25,186
Yeah, it's too much.

1520
01:01:25,219 --> 01:01:26,053
Right?

1521
01:01:27,855 --> 01:01:29,624
You thinking about Jake?

1522
01:01:29,658 --> 01:01:30,958
Yeah, a little.

1523
01:01:30,991 --> 01:01:32,393
Yeah, well...

1524
01:01:34,461 --> 01:01:35,729
It was grow or die,

1525
01:01:37,798 --> 01:01:39,133
and he was holding us back.

1526
01:01:41,068 --> 01:01:42,970
And this is just feeling
so right.

1527
01:01:43,003 --> 01:01:45,806
Can you feel it?
Like we're about to go stratospheric.

1528
01:01:47,642 --> 01:01:49,109
(tense synth music)

1529
01:01:49,143 --> 01:01:50,512
Looking good, looking good.

1530
01:01:50,545 --> 01:01:51,946
All right.

1531
01:01:51,979 --> 01:01:53,180
See right there. We got Desmond.

1532
01:01:53,214 --> 01:01:54,982
He's amazing.

1533
01:01:55,015 --> 01:01:56,618
New York Times
just did a huge profile on him.

1534
01:01:56,651 --> 01:01:58,319
We got Rola right over there.

1535
01:01:58,352 --> 01:01:59,820
Does a bit of everything:

1536
01:01:59,853 --> 01:02:02,524
fashion, movies,
food trendsetter.

1537
01:02:02,557 --> 01:02:06,126
Single handily brought back
cauliflower this year.

1538
01:02:06,160 --> 01:02:07,629
That's Jake Paul, blonde.

1539
01:02:07,662 --> 01:02:10,665
He's 5.8 billion views
on YouTube.

1540
01:02:10,699 --> 01:02:11,498
- Mhm.
- You know the story.

1541
01:02:11,533 --> 01:02:12,967
Mhm.

1542
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:14,134
Patrick Starr, right there,
far left.

1543
01:02:14,168 --> 01:02:16,136
Makeup tutorial. Great.

1544
01:02:16,170 --> 01:02:17,004
Who's that?

1545
01:02:17,037 --> 01:02:18,239
The other blonde.

1546
01:02:18,272 --> 01:02:19,807
Oh, the dirty blonde.

1547
01:02:19,840 --> 01:02:21,242
That's Lana.

1548
01:02:21,275 --> 01:02:23,244
She's fuckin',
a huge powerhouse.

1549
01:02:23,277 --> 01:02:25,913
She does these makeup tutorials
for Christians,

1550
01:02:25,946 --> 01:02:29,083
look fresh for Jesus,
made $200 million last year.

1551
01:02:29,116 --> 01:02:30,484
It's fuckin' huge.

1552
01:02:30,518 --> 01:02:31,686
- Look at that.
- That's amazing.

1553
01:02:31,720 --> 01:02:33,354
I've never seen that.

1554
01:02:33,387 --> 01:02:34,989
- That's a selfie train.
- Greetings, fellas.

1555
01:02:35,022 --> 01:02:36,591
No One Special.

1556
01:02:36,625 --> 01:02:38,058
A childhood icon.

1557
01:02:38,092 --> 01:02:39,661
I used to be obsessed with you.

1558
01:02:39,694 --> 01:02:40,995
Big fan.

1559
01:02:41,028 --> 01:02:42,396
- Yeah, 10 years ago.
- Crazy.

1560
01:02:42,429 --> 01:02:43,230
- Nice to meet you.
- 12 years ago.

1561
01:02:43,264 --> 01:02:44,431
(laughs)

1562
01:02:44,465 --> 01:02:45,332
How are we doing? Are we set?

1563
01:02:45,366 --> 01:02:47,001
I'm set, you set?

1564
01:02:47,034 --> 01:02:48,435
Oh man, you really shot
the moon with that suit.

1565
01:02:48,469 --> 01:02:49,937
You look hotter
than a five dollar Rolex.

1566
01:02:49,970 --> 01:02:51,506
- Let's do this.
- (Link laughs)

1567
01:02:51,539 --> 01:02:52,674
- Let's do it, let's do it.
- Showtime.

1568
01:02:52,707 --> 01:02:54,074
That's great. That's great.

1569
01:02:57,545 --> 01:02:59,046
Okay, show people.

1570
01:02:59,079 --> 01:03:00,682
I want us to have fun,
but just know

1571
01:03:00,715 --> 01:03:02,783
we're live streaming this
so no swearing,

1572
01:03:02,816 --> 01:03:04,318
especially you, Desmond.

1573
01:03:05,452 --> 01:03:07,821
And we're gonna go live
right over here.

1574
01:03:08,789 --> 01:03:10,257
All right.

1575
01:03:10,291 --> 01:03:12,092
Welcome back
to the Ted Wick show.

1576
01:03:12,126 --> 01:03:14,094
That's me.

1577
01:03:14,128 --> 01:03:15,829
I am right here with some of
your favorite influencers,

1578
01:03:16,731 --> 01:03:19,433
and right now
we have the big guy.

1579
01:03:19,466 --> 01:03:20,568
No One Special.

1580
01:03:21,468 --> 01:03:24,038
I gotta say, man, I think you
and the work you do

1581
01:03:24,071 --> 01:03:25,072
is super interesting.

1582
01:03:25,105 --> 01:03:26,073
Thanks for being with us.

1583
01:03:26,106 --> 01:03:27,241
No, thank you, Ted.

1584
01:03:27,274 --> 01:03:28,976
I'm very, very happy to be here.

1585
01:03:29,009 --> 01:03:30,745
The common thread
throughout most of your videos

1586
01:03:30,779 --> 01:03:33,213
seems to be a comment
on the viewer's isolation,

1587
01:03:33,247 --> 01:03:36,785
their over dependency
on social media, the internet,

1588
01:03:36,817 --> 01:03:39,386
yet your growing popularity
is derived

1589
01:03:39,420 --> 01:03:43,123
from your disdain,
from the very thing making you popular.

1590
01:03:43,157 --> 01:03:44,325
Ka-pow.

1591
01:03:44,358 --> 01:03:45,826
That's crazy, Ted.

1592
01:03:45,859 --> 01:03:47,662
That's really insightful.
Thank you.

1593
01:03:47,696 --> 01:03:50,331
And your biggest success
to date is kind of a game show

1594
01:03:50,364 --> 01:03:52,634
where you demonstrate
the viewers addiction

1595
01:03:52,667 --> 01:03:54,835
to their cell phones.

1596
01:03:54,868 --> 01:03:58,405
Your success directly contradicts
your message, does it not?

1597
01:03:58,439 --> 01:04:00,709
Sorry, uh, sorry, everybody,
I just,

1598
01:04:02,343 --> 01:04:03,812
are you saying I'm a sellout,
Ted?

1599
01:04:03,844 --> 01:04:04,978
I'm not saying anything.

1600
01:04:05,012 --> 01:04:07,147
I'm merely asking the questions.

1601
01:04:07,181 --> 01:04:08,282
All right, good.

1602
01:04:08,315 --> 01:04:09,917
Good, great.

1603
01:04:09,950 --> 01:04:12,186
See I think that you
insult the viewers.

1604
01:04:12,219 --> 01:04:16,758
You tell them that they're
stupid for watching us.

1605
01:04:16,791 --> 01:04:20,127
Wait, are you the person
that tells 10-year-old girls

1606
01:04:20,160 --> 01:04:21,929
to look sexy for Jesus?

1607
01:04:21,962 --> 01:04:24,833
No. I don't tell them
how to look sexy for Jesus.

1608
01:04:24,865 --> 01:04:26,467
Can you tell me
the passage in the Bible

1609
01:04:26,500 --> 01:04:28,035
where they talk
about contouring?

1610
01:04:28,068 --> 01:04:29,503
What, what is that?

1611
01:04:29,537 --> 01:04:31,004
Is that Corinthians?
Is that Genesis?

1612
01:04:31,038 --> 01:04:33,040
As a matter of fact, in Genesis,

1613
01:04:33,073 --> 01:04:37,846
God commands us to take care
of all his creations,

1614
01:04:37,878 --> 01:04:39,880
and that includes ourselves.

1615
01:04:39,913 --> 01:04:41,982
So God is basically saying
cover up

1616
01:04:42,015 --> 01:04:43,852
all of your so-called flaws?

1617
01:04:43,884 --> 01:04:45,553
I need a root beer.

1618
01:04:45,587 --> 01:04:46,621
She needs a root beer.

1619
01:04:46,654 --> 01:04:48,556
Okay. There goes Desmond.

1620
01:04:48,590 --> 01:04:49,990
I'm out. Goodbye.

1621
01:04:50,023 --> 01:04:51,058
God, I love that Desmond.

1622
01:04:51,091 --> 01:04:52,527
All right.

1623
01:04:52,560 --> 01:04:54,895
I got to say,
what I do love about you

1624
01:04:54,928 --> 01:04:57,464
is how you work
to empower people.

1625
01:04:57,498 --> 01:05:00,535
Now, here is a recent clip
of your online game show.

1626
01:05:00,568 --> 01:05:01,669
What's your secret, Isabelle,

1627
01:05:01,703 --> 01:05:03,203
for looking so damn fresh?

1628
01:05:04,037 --> 01:05:06,473
I drink a lot of water, I guess?

1629
01:05:06,508 --> 01:05:08,242
Ah, Isabelle.

1630
01:05:08,275 --> 01:05:10,244
The choice is ultimately yours.
So what's it gonna be?

1631
01:05:10,277 --> 01:05:12,680
Is it gonna be your phone,
or your vanity?

1632
01:05:12,714 --> 01:05:15,983
(clock ticking)

1633
01:05:16,016 --> 01:05:17,652
- (audience cheering)
- (clapping)

1634
01:05:17,685 --> 01:05:19,253
Wow.

1635
01:05:19,286 --> 01:05:20,755
Look at that young lady,
she looks so happy.

1636
01:05:20,789 --> 01:05:24,826
And now here is
the same clip unedited.

1637
01:05:24,859 --> 01:05:26,393
It's just been sent to us

1638
01:05:26,427 --> 01:05:29,831
and it kind of tells
a different story.

1639
01:05:29,864 --> 01:05:31,398
Did you know about this?

1640
01:05:31,432 --> 01:05:32,266
I don't know.

1641
01:05:33,467 --> 01:05:34,501
- (Isabelle sobbing)
- Stop crying.

1642
01:05:34,536 --> 01:05:36,437
Stop crying right now.

1643
01:05:36,470 --> 01:05:41,041
That's all you must do to
lead the revolution, Isabelle.

1644
01:05:41,074 --> 01:05:45,446
-(audience cheering)

1645
01:05:45,479 --> 01:05:47,080
Making young girls cry.

1646
01:05:47,114 --> 01:05:49,416
Doesn't that go against
everything you stand for?

1647
01:05:49,450 --> 01:05:51,018
(Link sighs)

1648
01:05:51,051 --> 01:05:52,554
Wow, that's good.
That's very good, Ted.

1649
01:05:52,587 --> 01:05:53,721
That's not supposed to
be out there.

1650
01:05:53,755 --> 01:05:55,723
We, we cut that out of the show.

1651
01:05:55,757 --> 01:05:58,225
That poor girl.
What's wrong with you?

1652
01:05:58,258 --> 01:06:00,260
Patrick,
spare me your faux outrage,

1653
01:06:00,294 --> 01:06:01,863
just for a second, okay?

1654
01:06:01,896 --> 01:06:03,363
That was an outtake
and we took it out.

1655
01:06:03,397 --> 01:06:05,065
Because you humiliated her.

1656
01:06:05,098 --> 01:06:07,067
It's out of context.

1657
01:06:07,100 --> 01:06:09,236
People take seconds at a time
and try to judge you for that.

1658
01:06:09,269 --> 01:06:10,370
- Exactly.
- Only that.

1659
01:06:10,404 --> 01:06:12,574
But now what you're doing,

1660
01:06:12,607 --> 01:06:14,408
you're humiliating a girl in
public, so who's the hypocrite?

1661
01:06:14,441 --> 01:06:15,577
- I didn't leak that clip.
- Fake news.

1662
01:06:15,610 --> 01:06:17,110
It's all over the internet.

1663
01:06:17,144 --> 01:06:18,979
You know who made
that girl cry, Ted?

1664
01:06:19,012 --> 01:06:20,280
Not me.

1665
01:06:20,314 --> 01:06:21,783
- It was Lana.
- Excuse me?

1666
01:06:21,816 --> 01:06:22,983
Lana made that girl cry.

1667
01:06:23,016 --> 01:06:24,819
- Lana, Lana-
- Oh, me?

1668
01:06:24,853 --> 01:06:27,154
Lana is spreading toxic waste
into the culture, Ted.

1669
01:06:27,187 --> 01:06:28,723
She is poisoning.

1670
01:06:28,756 --> 01:06:30,625
You are, I'm sorry, baby,
but you are.

1671
01:06:30,658 --> 01:06:32,760
You're poisoning the minds
and the souls and the hearts

1672
01:06:32,794 --> 01:06:34,729
of young girls
throughout the country,

1673
01:06:34,762 --> 01:06:36,798
and you are making them
soul sick

1674
01:06:36,831 --> 01:06:40,300
because you are telling them
subliminally and insidiously

1675
01:06:40,334 --> 01:06:41,936
that they are not enough
as they are,

1676
01:06:41,970 --> 01:06:43,571
that they are not acceptable
as they are.

1677
01:06:43,605 --> 01:06:45,405
That if you don't look
like a Kardashian,

1678
01:06:45,439 --> 01:06:46,975
then you're nothing.

1679
01:06:47,007 --> 01:06:48,442
That's the message
you're giving, Lana.

1680
01:06:48,475 --> 01:06:50,177
And let me tell you
something else

1681
01:06:50,210 --> 01:06:51,178
about Jesus said,
a prophet will not be accepted

1682
01:06:51,211 --> 01:06:52,914
in his hometown.

1683
01:06:52,947 --> 01:06:54,147
What?

1684
01:06:54,181 --> 01:06:55,482
Oh, come on, get off the cross.

1685
01:06:55,517 --> 01:06:56,951
We need the wood.

1686
01:06:56,985 --> 01:07:00,755
That poor, poor, poor,
poor girl.

1687
01:07:00,788 --> 01:07:02,122
How many poor's was that?

1688
01:07:03,825 --> 01:07:05,092
Look, she still asked
for my number

1689
01:07:05,125 --> 01:07:05,960
at the end of the show.

1690
01:07:05,994 --> 01:07:07,461
Meaning what?

1691
01:07:07,494 --> 01:07:09,096
Meaning she couldn't have been
that sad

1692
01:07:09,129 --> 01:07:10,798
because she was still
trying to fuck me.

1693
01:07:10,832 --> 01:07:12,634
- (Jake chuckles)
- Oh my goodness.

1694
01:07:12,667 --> 01:07:14,101
Oh shit, this man.

1695
01:07:14,134 --> 01:07:15,269
Why would you even
bring that up?

1696
01:07:15,302 --> 01:07:16,604
- Okay.
- You're sick.

1697
01:07:16,638 --> 01:07:18,171
Mr. Special, can I remind you,

1698
01:07:18,205 --> 01:07:20,107
we are live
and there are children watching.

1699
01:07:20,140 --> 01:07:21,543
Amen.

1700
01:07:21,576 --> 01:07:22,677
I bring it up, Lana,
because it's all

1701
01:07:22,710 --> 01:07:24,144
part of the same sickness.

1702
01:07:24,177 --> 01:07:26,346
If you bag a night
with a celebrity,

1703
01:07:26,380 --> 01:07:28,048
it's just another way of trying
to prove that you're worthy.

1704
01:07:28,081 --> 01:07:29,817
She should know she is worthy.

1705
01:07:29,851 --> 01:07:31,019
She shouldn't need to prove it.

1706
01:07:31,051 --> 01:07:32,452
That's not a life.

1707
01:07:32,486 --> 01:07:33,655
That's not a life worth living.

1708
01:07:33,688 --> 01:07:35,023
- This...
- This dude.

1709
01:07:36,089 --> 01:07:38,526
Why don't we talk
about your background?

1710
01:07:38,560 --> 01:07:40,494
We tried doing
a little research on you

1711
01:07:40,528 --> 01:07:42,797
before you came on the show
and we couldn't find anything.

1712
01:07:42,830 --> 01:07:43,965
I know what this is.

1713
01:07:43,998 --> 01:07:45,165
Where'd you grow up?

1714
01:07:45,198 --> 01:07:46,968
This is the point of the show

1715
01:07:47,001 --> 01:07:49,469
where you are trying
to resuscitate your career.

1716
01:07:49,503 --> 01:07:51,471
Ca-ca-ca-ca-ca-ca.

1717
01:07:51,506 --> 01:07:52,406
- Ca!
- Take it down a notch.

1718
01:07:52,439 --> 01:07:53,908
Did I hit a nerve?

1719
01:07:53,942 --> 01:07:55,610
You want to know who I am, Ted?

1720
01:07:58,378 --> 01:07:59,714
You wanna know the real me?

1721
01:08:02,382 --> 01:08:07,589
I eat, I shit, and I'll die
like everybody else.

1722
01:08:07,622 --> 01:08:09,057
You want me to shit, Ted?

1723
01:08:09,089 --> 01:08:10,658
- I'll shit for you, Ted.
- Profanity.

1724
01:08:10,692 --> 01:08:12,426
Want to see the real me?

1725
01:08:12,459 --> 01:08:13,928
- You wanna see me shit Ted?
- (influencers exclaiming)

1726
01:08:13,962 --> 01:08:15,530
'Cause I'll, you know,
I'll, I'll shit.

1727
01:08:15,563 --> 01:08:17,932
- Oh yeah, right.
- This is what happens, kids,

1728
01:08:17,966 --> 01:08:22,169
when you try to attack
the system.

1729
01:08:22,202 --> 01:08:25,006
The system will try
to attack you

1730
01:08:25,039 --> 01:08:28,543
and the only way
to beat the system

1731
01:08:28,576 --> 01:08:33,280
is to take a big, fat, shit
on it.

1732
01:08:33,313 --> 01:08:34,916
- Oh my...
- Security.

1733
01:08:34,949 --> 01:08:35,783
Woo!

1734
01:08:37,417 --> 01:08:38,251
Woo!

1735
01:08:39,787 --> 01:08:40,622
Ya-hoo!

1736
01:08:42,557 --> 01:08:43,591
You want a taste, honey?

1737
01:08:43,625 --> 01:08:45,627
Whoa, hey, hey.

1738
01:08:45,660 --> 01:08:46,928
Mark, get 'em Mark!

1739
01:08:47,762 --> 01:08:48,696
What's everyone afraid of?

1740
01:08:48,730 --> 01:08:50,263
It's just play-do.

1741
01:08:50,297 --> 01:08:52,967
(Link grunts)

1742
01:08:53,001 --> 01:08:54,969
(grunting)

1743
01:08:55,003 --> 01:08:56,738
Come and get me.

1744
01:08:56,771 --> 01:08:57,772
Come and get me, come and get
me, come and get me.

1745
01:08:57,805 --> 01:08:58,673
No, no, no, Mark!

1746
01:08:59,774 --> 01:09:00,942
Don't touch him.

1747
01:09:00,975 --> 01:09:02,142
I'll find someone to sue you!

1748
01:09:02,175 --> 01:09:03,945
This is a fight for your life!

1749
01:09:03,978 --> 01:09:05,613
This is the fight for your life!

1750
01:09:05,647 --> 01:09:07,381
Don't watch anything.

1751
01:09:07,414 --> 01:09:08,783
Don't view anything.

1752
01:09:08,816 --> 01:09:10,417
Don't like anything.

1753
01:09:10,450 --> 01:09:11,886
Don't click anything.

1754
01:09:11,919 --> 01:09:13,888
Don't let them turn you
into zombies.

1755
01:09:13,921 --> 01:09:15,657
They're trying to kill you,
unplug-

1756
01:09:16,791 --> 01:09:18,893
(tense synth music)

1757
01:09:18,926 --> 01:09:20,260
Go, go, go, go,
drive, drive, drive.

1758
01:09:20,293 --> 01:09:21,461
- Drive, drive!
- Go, go, go, go!

1759
01:09:21,495 --> 01:09:23,430
- Woo!
- You are crazy!

1760
01:09:29,037 --> 01:09:29,871
Are you okay?

1761
01:09:31,506 --> 01:09:33,473
(Frankie gasps)

1762
01:09:33,508 --> 01:09:35,076
Hey.

1763
01:09:35,109 --> 01:09:36,844
I gotta be at this thing.

1764
01:09:36,878 --> 01:09:38,079
What is it?

1765
01:09:38,112 --> 01:09:39,147
Oh, it's just some pool party

1766
01:09:39,179 --> 01:09:40,648
Mark wants me to go to.

1767
01:09:40,682 --> 01:09:42,449
You would hate it.
You wanna come?

1768
01:09:42,482 --> 01:09:43,316
Okay.

1769
01:09:49,322 --> 01:09:51,324
- (phone buzzes)
- All right, that's my ride.

1770
01:09:51,358 --> 01:09:52,160
I gotta go.

1771
01:09:53,628 --> 01:09:54,461
Hey.

1772
01:09:56,798 --> 01:09:57,632
Always us.

1773
01:10:01,169 --> 01:10:03,671

<i>♪ Greasy train wheels squeal

1775

1782
01:10:49,016 --> 01:10:50,317
Thank you.

1783
01:10:50,350 --> 01:10:52,587
(clapping)

1784
01:10:54,454 --> 01:10:57,257
(soft jazz music)

1785
01:10:59,127 --> 01:10:59,961
Hey.

1786
01:11:00,928 --> 01:11:02,362
Hi.

1787
01:11:02,395 --> 01:11:03,865
Is that your song?

1788
01:11:03,898 --> 01:11:04,732
Yeah.

1789
01:11:05,967 --> 01:11:07,434
It's beautiful.

1790
01:11:07,467 --> 01:11:08,435
Thank you.

1791
01:11:09,637 --> 01:11:10,470
I'm sorry.

1792
01:11:11,973 --> 01:11:12,874
I'm sorry, too.

1793
01:11:15,475 --> 01:11:16,778
I really need your help.

1794
01:11:18,546 --> 01:11:20,748
It's all falling apart
and I need you to come back

1795
01:11:20,782 --> 01:11:22,282
so I can put it back together.

1796
01:11:23,651 --> 01:11:25,253
I want to go back
to the way things were.

1797
01:11:25,285 --> 01:11:27,588
I want to incorporate
more of your ideas.

1798
01:11:27,622 --> 01:11:28,455
I can't.

1799
01:11:29,489 --> 01:11:32,325
(soft jazz music)

1800
01:11:40,234 --> 01:11:42,970
Was it you that leaked
the footage of Isabelle?

1801
01:11:43,004 --> 01:11:44,272
Wow, really?

1802
01:11:45,173 --> 01:11:46,707
Is that why you came back here?

1803
01:11:46,741 --> 01:11:48,276
To see if I leaked
the fucking video?

1804
01:11:48,308 --> 01:11:49,544
You think I want to subject
that girl

1805
01:11:49,577 --> 01:11:50,711
to even more humiliation?

1806
01:11:50,745 --> 01:11:51,846
Who do you think I am?

1807
01:11:54,782 --> 01:11:55,917
He's full of shit.

1808
01:11:58,286 --> 01:11:59,287
Link?

1809
01:11:59,319 --> 01:12:00,922
That's not even his name.

1810
01:12:00,955 --> 01:12:02,723
He's not who he says he is.

1811
01:12:02,757 --> 01:12:04,391
I spoke to his brother.

1812
01:12:04,424 --> 01:12:05,960
He was the one yelling at him
in the graveyard.

1813
01:12:06,861 --> 01:12:08,461
He's a rich kid.

1814
01:12:08,495 --> 01:12:10,998
Really. His parents are alive.

1815
01:12:11,032 --> 01:12:12,332
Link's parents died.

1816
01:12:12,365 --> 01:12:13,201
No.

1817
01:12:15,335 --> 01:12:16,838
His brother tracked us down.

1818
01:12:17,805 --> 01:12:18,673
Here.

1819
01:12:18,706 --> 01:12:20,274
Read this.

1820
01:12:20,308 --> 01:12:21,309
Okay?

1821
01:12:21,341 --> 01:12:23,244
There's a lot in here.

1822
01:12:23,277 --> 01:12:24,444
He burned down his school.
He's been institutionalized.

1823
01:12:24,477 --> 01:12:26,413
The family is covering it up.

1824
01:12:26,446 --> 01:12:28,516
You can call me jealous,
you can call me pathetic,

1825
01:12:28,549 --> 01:12:30,151
but I am telling you
he is a liar

1826
01:12:30,184 --> 01:12:31,719
and you need to open your eyes.

1827
01:12:36,657 --> 01:12:39,160
Why would you do this?

1828
01:12:39,193 --> 01:12:40,862
Because I'm in love with you.

1829
01:12:43,331 --> 01:12:44,932
And I've always been in love
with you,

1830
01:12:44,966 --> 01:12:46,399
and I know that doesn't
even matter, but I am.

1831
01:12:49,502 --> 01:12:52,340
(soft jazz music)

1832
01:12:53,373 --> 01:12:54,208
I'm sorry.

1833
01:13:08,155 --> 01:13:10,658
(tense music)

1834
01:13:17,732 --> 01:13:18,733
(Link laughs)

1835
01:13:18,766 --> 01:13:20,334
What do you call that?

1836
01:13:20,368 --> 01:13:21,369
Trust me,
I'm gonna get you out of here.

1837
01:13:21,401 --> 01:13:22,370
You gotta kick the habit.

1838
01:13:22,402 --> 01:13:23,871
Do you eat peanuts?

1839
01:13:23,905 --> 01:13:25,506
There's a lot of peanuts
in Thai food.

1840
01:13:25,539 --> 01:13:26,374
All right,
intimacy levels are too high.

1841
01:13:26,406 --> 01:13:27,341
Abort mission.

1842
01:13:27,375 --> 01:13:28,743
Why'd you do that?

1843
01:13:28,776 --> 01:13:29,977
It's beautiful,
it's a part of you.

1844
01:13:30,011 --> 01:13:30,845
You gotta be dumb to be smart.

1845
01:13:30,878 --> 01:13:31,846
(tires squeal)

1846
01:13:31,879 --> 01:13:33,147
(crashing)

1847
01:13:33,180 --> 01:13:34,582
Shit!

1848
01:13:36,350 --> 01:13:38,552
(Frankie winces)

1849
01:13:38,586 --> 01:13:40,388
(door unlocks)

1850
01:13:40,420 --> 01:13:41,555
Hey Frankie.

1851
01:13:41,589 --> 01:13:43,024
Hey Frankie.

1852
01:13:43,057 --> 01:13:44,491
Hey Frankie.

1853
01:13:44,525 --> 01:13:45,526
Hey Frankie.

1854
01:13:46,861 --> 01:13:47,862
Are you okay?

1855
01:13:47,895 --> 01:13:49,230
I'm fine.

1856
01:13:49,263 --> 01:13:50,564
- I just cut my hand.
- Oh, shit.

1857
01:13:50,598 --> 01:13:51,832
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- No, no, no.

1858
01:13:51,866 --> 01:13:53,234
- Can I see?
- Yeah, yeah.

1859
01:13:53,267 --> 01:13:55,903
- (Link winces)
- Ow.

1860
01:13:55,937 --> 01:13:57,171
I'm sorry.

1861
01:13:57,204 --> 01:13:58,272
- It's okay.
- That sucks.

1862
01:13:58,306 --> 01:13:59,407
Okay, keep pressure on it.

1863
01:14:00,541 --> 01:14:01,943
I'll get you something.

1864
01:14:01,976 --> 01:14:04,879
Uh, let's see
what we got in here.

1865
01:14:04,912 --> 01:14:07,048
We're gonna fix you up.

1866
01:14:07,081 --> 01:14:08,950
Here, this is going to be nice.

1867
01:14:08,983 --> 01:14:09,784
Let me see.

1868
01:14:12,485 --> 01:14:13,321
Aww.

1869
01:14:19,060 --> 01:14:21,796
I wanted to tell you
I got this kind of big news

1870
01:14:22,797 --> 01:14:25,333
and I didn't want to share
with anybody but you.

1871
01:14:29,236 --> 01:14:30,972
What is it?

1872
01:14:31,005 --> 01:14:33,341
They want me to headline
a live stream event for YouTube.

1873
01:14:35,977 --> 01:14:38,145
(laughing)

1874
01:14:38,179 --> 01:14:43,084
And I just realized that I got
nothing to say without you.

1875
01:14:43,117 --> 01:14:45,152
It scares me.

1876
01:14:45,186 --> 01:14:47,822
I've never felt this way about
another human being before.

1877
01:14:52,960 --> 01:14:55,629
(heart beating)

1878
01:14:57,497 --> 01:15:02,502
- (heart beating)

I could definitely do it.

1886
01:15:48,849 --> 01:15:51,085
Yeah, it's very easy to do.

1887
01:15:52,553 --> 01:15:53,888
What the fuck?

1888
01:15:55,990 --> 01:15:57,191
It's crazy.

1889
01:15:57,224 --> 01:15:59,126
It's crazy.

1890
01:15:59,160 --> 01:16:01,028
Imagine this place
full of people?

1891
01:16:01,062 --> 01:16:02,663
A couple hundred
lucky ticket holders,

1892
01:16:02,696 --> 01:16:04,698
an estimated
five million watching live.

1893
01:16:04,732 --> 01:16:07,368
- Around the world!
- Around the world!

1894
01:16:08,602 --> 01:16:10,171
Crazy.

1895
01:16:10,204 --> 01:16:11,572
And Mark thinks
I can fly in from the back.

1896
01:16:11,605 --> 01:16:12,840
Why?

1897
01:16:12,873 --> 01:16:15,176
Spectacle is why. Look at this.

1898
01:16:15,209 --> 01:16:17,945
But we haven't even figured out
what we're gonna say?

1899
01:16:19,914 --> 01:16:21,849
Maybe we'll figure that out
later.

1900
01:16:21,882 --> 01:16:23,518
And you're even gonna hear 'em
over the screaming anyway.

1901
01:16:23,552 --> 01:16:24,553
Let me show you something.

1902
01:16:24,585 --> 01:16:25,986
Hm?

1903
01:16:26,020 --> 01:16:26,687
You guys wanna see
something crazy?

1904
01:16:26,720 --> 01:16:28,155
Sure.

1905
01:16:28,189 --> 01:16:30,724
This right here,
this is a trap door.

1906
01:16:30,758 --> 01:16:31,859
Whoa!

1907
01:16:31,892 --> 01:16:32,726
Oh!

1908
01:16:34,061 --> 01:16:37,064
(tense synth music)

1909
01:16:50,244 --> 01:16:52,113
Roberts faced heavy trolling

1910
01:16:52,146 --> 01:16:54,348
on social media after a clip
surfaced of the game show.

1911
01:16:54,381 --> 01:16:57,552
Mr. Special defended his actions
at a round table discussion

1912
01:16:57,586 --> 01:17:00,955
where he accused Ms. Roberts
of trying to seduce him.

1913
01:17:00,988 --> 01:17:02,623
She couldn't have been that sad

1914
01:17:02,656 --> 01:17:04,526
because she was still
trying (bleep).

1915
01:17:04,559 --> 01:17:06,727
If you bag a night
with a celebrity,

1916
01:17:06,760 --> 01:17:09,029
it's just another way of trying
to prove that you're worthy.

1917
01:17:09,063 --> 01:17:11,799
She shouldn't need to prove it.
That's not a life.

1918
01:17:11,832 --> 01:17:13,901
That's not a life worth living.

1919
01:17:13,934 --> 01:17:15,537
Early reports suggest

1920
01:17:15,570 --> 01:17:17,371
she hanged herself
in her bedroom closet.

1921
01:17:17,404 --> 01:17:20,975
A coroner at the scene
says he does not believe...

1922
01:17:21,008 --> 01:17:24,845
(tense, dramatic synth music)

1923
01:18:34,415 --> 01:18:39,019
- (barfing)
- (clattering)

1924
01:18:42,856 --> 01:18:44,925
(coughs)

1925
01:18:47,995 --> 01:18:49,496
- (water running)
- (bubbling)

1926
01:18:49,531 --> 01:18:51,332
Mark.

1927
01:18:51,365 --> 01:18:52,567
Mark.

1928
01:18:53,767 --> 01:18:54,735
Have you seen this?

1929
01:18:54,768 --> 01:18:55,803
Everybody hates me.

1930
01:18:55,836 --> 01:18:57,171
Everyone's blaming me.

1931
01:18:57,204 --> 01:18:59,940
It says
No One Special's canceled.

1932
01:19:01,108 --> 01:19:02,343
This asshole
needs to burn in hell.

1933
01:19:02,376 --> 01:19:04,011
How are we going to fix it?

1934
01:19:04,044 --> 01:19:06,747
You told her
her life wasn't worth living.

1935
01:19:06,780 --> 01:19:08,583
I didn't ask her
to kill herself.

1936
01:19:10,685 --> 01:19:11,885
Are you blaming me, too?

1937
01:19:12,753 --> 01:19:14,488
Oh, oh, oh.

1938
01:19:14,522 --> 01:19:18,025
Wow, wow, wow, fu...

1939
01:19:18,058 --> 01:19:19,994
A girl is dead
and all you care about

1940
01:19:20,027 --> 01:19:21,795
is what people
are saying about you.

1941
01:19:25,199 --> 01:19:26,800
Jake talked to your brother.

1942
01:19:28,969 --> 01:19:32,741
Have you told me
one single thing that was true?

1943
01:19:43,217 --> 01:19:44,051
I'm sorry.

1944
01:19:47,589 --> 01:19:49,056
I'm sorry I didn't stop you.

1945
01:20:07,107 --> 01:20:10,512
(soft, melancholy music)

1946
01:20:22,624 --> 01:20:27,629
- (sobbing)
- (soft, melancholy music)

1947
01:20:29,163 --> 01:20:32,667
(soft, melancholy music)

1948
01:21:05,667 --> 01:21:09,870
Hey guys, so I read the news
about Link and Isabelle

1949
01:21:09,903 --> 01:21:11,806
and I want to apologize
for even having

1950
01:21:11,840 --> 01:21:13,474
that guy on the show.

1951
01:21:13,508 --> 01:21:14,642
To Isabelle,
my condolences go out to you.

1952
01:21:14,676 --> 01:21:15,943
This makes me so mad.

1953
01:21:15,976 --> 01:21:17,545
This could have been prevented.

1954
01:21:17,579 --> 01:21:19,012
- What's up with this dude?
- You're a joke.

1955
01:21:19,046 --> 01:21:20,381
- This woman is dead...
- Thrown in jail!

1956
01:21:20,414 --> 01:21:22,483
That girl
was just a fuckin' ho...

1957
01:21:22,517 --> 01:21:23,651
- He had very good points.
- Murderer.

1958
01:21:23,685 --> 01:21:25,119
He killed that girl.

1959
01:21:25,152 --> 01:21:26,320
I like
how he tells it how it is.

1960
01:21:26,353 --> 01:21:28,055
This guy is an A-one scumbag.

1961
01:21:28,088 --> 01:21:29,691
I think that No One Special
should be President.

1962
01:21:29,724 --> 01:21:31,626
- I just wanna say-
- Fuck No One Special.

1963
01:21:31,659 --> 01:21:34,729
- You suck.
- We love No One Special.

1964
01:21:35,830 --> 01:21:40,668
- (applause)
- (tense music)

1965
01:22:02,222 --> 01:22:05,727
(dramatic ethereal music)

1966
01:22:27,816 --> 01:22:31,318
(upbeat synth pop music)

1967
01:22:58,513 --> 01:22:59,346
Hey!

1968
01:23:00,682 --> 01:23:05,687
- (phone pinging)
- (upbeat synth pop music)

1969
01:23:06,353 --> 01:23:09,791
(upbeat synth pop music)

1970
01:23:45,627 --> 01:23:50,632
- (audience cheering)
- (synth pop music)

1971
01:24:02,242 --> 01:24:04,812
(audience cheering)

1972
01:24:04,846 --> 01:24:07,782
I want to dedicate this
performance to Isabelle Roberts.

1973
01:24:07,815 --> 01:24:09,817
Isabelle was an amazing girl

1974
01:24:10,985 --> 01:24:14,121
and she passed away tragically
two days ago.

1975
01:24:14,154 --> 01:24:16,290
I want to send out all my love,

1976
01:24:16,323 --> 01:24:20,762
my thoughts, and my prayers
to her family and her friends.

1977
01:24:23,031 --> 01:24:24,364
And I wanna say I'm sorry.

1978
01:24:26,734 --> 01:24:27,569
I'm sorry.

1979
01:24:30,705 --> 01:24:35,710
- (tense music)
- (insects buzzing)

1980
01:24:39,747 --> 01:24:43,851
I've been told that I should
feel some responsibility

1981
01:24:43,885 --> 01:24:45,419
for what happened and...

1982
01:24:46,453 --> 01:24:49,389
But I can't just stand here
and...

1983
01:24:49,423 --> 01:24:50,525
(soft ethereal music)

1984
01:24:50,558 --> 01:24:51,693
Shut up, shut up, shut up.

1985
01:24:51,726 --> 01:24:54,062
That, that part's canceled.

1986
01:24:54,127 --> 01:24:57,097
I can't just stand here
and accept responsibility

1987
01:24:57,130 --> 01:24:59,701
for someone else's choices,
actions,

1988
01:24:59,734 --> 01:25:03,103
and in fact it was you
who pushed her

1989
01:25:03,136 --> 01:25:04,939
over the fucking cliff's edge.

1990
01:25:07,609 --> 01:25:11,311
Yeah, you,
with your gutless trolling.

1991
01:25:12,446 --> 01:25:14,882
You killed her, motherfucker!

1992
01:25:14,916 --> 01:25:16,249
All of you killed her.

1993
01:25:16,283 --> 01:25:17,619
That's the truth.

1994
01:25:17,652 --> 01:25:18,786
And you're trying
to kill me, too,

1995
01:25:18,820 --> 01:25:19,854
and I'm not gonna let it happen.

1996
01:25:19,887 --> 01:25:21,221
No, not today.

1997
01:25:21,254 --> 01:25:22,122
Not ever.

1998
01:25:25,225 --> 01:25:27,562
Easy to talk shit when it's
behind a screen, right?

1999
01:25:27,595 --> 01:25:29,697
What about right now?
I dare you.

2000
01:25:29,731 --> 01:25:31,733
Come through that computer
screen you're hiding behind,

2001
01:25:31,766 --> 01:25:34,802
stand in this room, stand face to
face, do it to my face.

2002
01:25:34,836 --> 01:25:36,604
Anybody in the room, anybody?

2003
01:25:41,341 --> 01:25:43,911
Look, maybe I did push Isabelle too far.
Maybe I did.

2004
01:25:43,945 --> 01:25:47,048
I pushed her too far.
Maybe I was using her for views.

2005
01:25:47,081 --> 01:25:49,751
I'll cop to that,
but I did it for you.

2006
01:25:52,452 --> 01:25:54,889
You see what this shit
is doing to us?

2007
01:25:54,922 --> 01:25:56,557
We're not real to each other
anymore

2008
01:25:56,591 --> 01:25:58,726
and we're all
just using each other.

2009
01:25:58,760 --> 01:26:00,327
This isn't a vi...

2010
01:26:00,360 --> 01:26:01,829
I'm not a video game.
I'm not two dimensional.

2011
01:26:01,863 --> 01:26:04,231
I'm not two-D.
I'm flesh and I'm blood.

2012
01:26:04,264 --> 01:26:06,134
You're all flesh and blood.

2013
01:26:06,166 --> 01:26:07,835
Isabelle was flesh and blood.

2014
01:26:08,670 --> 01:26:10,104
We're all just
fucking killing each other,

2015
01:26:10,138 --> 01:26:11,039
like it's sport.

2016
01:26:14,042 --> 01:26:15,043
We're fucked.

2017
01:26:16,711 --> 01:26:18,079
Oh, you want me to be nice?

2018
01:26:18,112 --> 01:26:19,747
I almost had you, didn't I?

2019
01:26:19,781 --> 01:26:24,018
With the candles
and the choir and the singing.

2020
01:26:25,853 --> 01:26:28,022
That's what we want him to say.
What a good boy.

2021
01:26:28,056 --> 01:26:29,957
He's playing so nice.

2022
01:26:29,991 --> 01:26:31,559
We can let him back in the club.

2023
01:26:32,694 --> 01:26:35,462
Fuck that club!

2024
01:26:35,495 --> 01:26:37,464
I'm trying to wake you up
from that club,

2025
01:26:37,497 --> 01:26:40,200
you numbed out,
dead inside zombies!

2026
01:26:42,302 --> 01:26:43,938
You're all dead!

2027
01:26:43,971 --> 01:26:44,806
You're all numb!

2028
01:26:46,373 --> 01:26:47,809
I'm sorry.

2029
01:26:47,842 --> 01:26:49,544
This is the first time
in my life

2030
01:26:49,577 --> 01:26:51,445
where I felt a part
of something bigger than me,

2031
01:26:51,478 --> 01:26:52,613
something that I don't
want to lose.

2032
01:26:52,647 --> 01:26:53,881
I don't want to lose you,

2033
01:26:55,817 --> 01:26:58,351
but I refuse
to let you straitjacket me!

2034
01:27:02,389 --> 01:27:03,524
I can't.

2035
01:27:03,558 --> 01:27:05,292
I gotta speak my truth, man.

2036
01:27:05,325 --> 01:27:06,527
I gotta speak my truth.

2037
01:27:06,561 --> 01:27:08,162
You know, what's crazy?

2038
01:27:10,098 --> 01:27:11,632
I want to do what I want.

2039
01:27:11,666 --> 01:27:13,668
I'm on the stage.
I don't give a fuck.

2040
01:27:13,701 --> 01:27:15,169
I'll fuckin' hump the stage.

2041
01:27:15,203 --> 01:27:18,172
(grunting)

2042
01:27:18,206 --> 01:27:20,373
(Link screams)

2043
01:27:22,744 --> 01:27:26,681
I'm not gonna play
fucking Coldplay songs.

2044
01:27:26,714 --> 01:27:29,349
I'm not gonna play
Coldplay songs.

2045
01:27:29,382 --> 01:27:31,318
Fucking watch Coldplay!

2046
01:27:31,351 --> 01:27:33,353
You're trying to kill my deep,
profound,

2047
01:27:33,386 --> 01:27:34,856
life giving impulse.

2048
01:27:34,889 --> 01:27:36,190
I'm not gonna let you do it.

2049
01:27:36,224 --> 01:27:37,558
No! Hell no.

2050
01:27:37,592 --> 01:27:38,425
Not today.

2051
01:27:41,696 --> 01:27:43,531
You know what the best part
of all this is?

2052
01:27:43,564 --> 01:27:45,199
You're just the same as me,

2053
01:27:45,233 --> 01:27:47,869
way down there
in that deep dark pit

2054
01:27:47,902 --> 01:27:49,537
you're afraid to look inside.

2055
01:27:49,570 --> 01:27:51,873
I'm just the only one
that's willing to say it.

2056
01:27:56,309 --> 01:27:58,146
My name is Alex Goodrich.

2057
01:28:00,447 --> 01:28:01,616
I'm from Connecticut,

2058
01:28:03,985 --> 01:28:06,621
and this is the first time
I'm telling you the truth.

2059
01:28:09,489 --> 01:28:11,159
And all I need to know is

2060
01:28:12,760 --> 01:28:15,395
are you with me
or are you against me?

2061
01:28:20,134 --> 01:28:22,970
And if you're with me,
click that like button.

2062
01:28:30,812 --> 01:28:31,646
Fuck you.

2063
01:28:34,115 --> 01:28:35,315
You're welcome.

2064
01:28:36,951 --> 01:28:38,953

No One Special! No One Special!

2068
01:28:51,833 --> 01:28:53,568
No One Special!

2069
01:28:53,601 --> 01:28:57,605
Special, Special,
Special, Special, Special,

2070
