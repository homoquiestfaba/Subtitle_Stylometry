[door knocking]

12
00:01:40,970 --> 00:01:42,711
- Hey stranger.

13
00:01:42,885 --> 00:01:44,756
- Darren, Hi.

14
00:01:44,930 --> 00:01:47,498
- I had to come take a look at
the presentation for myself.

15
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:50,545
Wow.

16
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:54,418
That is efficient.

17
00:01:54,592 --> 00:01:56,638
Not an inch of wasted space.

18
00:01:56,812 --> 00:01:58,335
I love that.

19
00:01:58,509 --> 00:01:59,789
Barrington is gonna be thrilled.

20
00:01:59,902 --> 00:02:01,556
- You think so?

21
00:02:02,861 --> 00:02:05,647
- I'm so glad I recommended
you for this project.

22
00:02:05,821 --> 00:02:07,039
- [chuckles] Me too.

23
00:02:07,214 --> 00:02:08,954
Me designing and you selling.

24
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:10,217
We make a great team.

25
00:02:12,088 --> 00:02:13,829
- I agree.

26
00:02:14,003 --> 00:02:15,894
- Ooh, I was actually able
to upgrade some of the units

27
00:02:15,918 --> 00:02:17,528
to three bedrooms,

28
00:02:17,702 --> 00:02:19,542
so we have the master
bedroom with an en suite,

29
00:02:19,617 --> 00:02:22,054
two small bedrooms
with Jack and Jill's.

30
00:02:22,229 --> 00:02:24,405
- Oh, it's perfect, for
his and her offices.

31
00:02:24,579 --> 00:02:26,363
- Or children's bedrooms.

32
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:31,803
- Oh, yeah, for anybody who's
into that sort of thing.

33
00:02:31,977 --> 00:02:33,283
- Like us, right?

34
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:35,154
- Yeah.

35
00:02:37,679 --> 00:02:38,984
You know, someday.

36
00:02:40,638 --> 00:02:41,770
When we're married.

37
00:02:41,944 --> 00:02:43,511
Someday.

38
00:02:43,685 --> 00:02:46,296
First, let's lock down
this Barrington deal.

39
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:50,082
And then, we can plan the
rest of our lives together.

40
00:02:50,257 --> 00:02:52,650
- You realize that you're
putting our life together

41
00:02:52,824 --> 00:02:55,479
in the hands of a
billionaire developer saying,

42
00:02:55,653 --> 00:02:58,003
yes, to a PowerPoint.

43
00:02:58,178 --> 00:02:59,570
- Yeah, absolutely.

44
00:02:59,744 --> 00:03:02,051
That's why you gotta
crush this pitch.

45
00:03:07,622 --> 00:03:09,754
[sighing]

46
00:03:14,672 --> 00:03:15,672
That's Barrington.

47
00:03:15,717 --> 00:03:16,717
I should go greet him.

48
00:03:16,761 --> 00:03:17,762
- I should come, too.

49
00:03:17,936 --> 00:03:19,416
- No, no, no, no, you stay here.

50
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:20,698
I want him to see you
in action, you know,

51
00:03:20,722 --> 00:03:21,984
when you're more in control.

52
00:03:22,158 --> 00:03:23,899
I'll go schmooze him, tee it up,

53
00:03:24,073 --> 00:03:26,467
and you... Bring it home.

54
00:03:27,076 --> 00:03:28,425
- [chuckling] Okay.

55
00:03:29,687 --> 00:03:31,036
[sighing]

56
00:03:32,516 --> 00:03:35,954
Thank you, for this
opportunity, Mr. Barrington.

57
00:03:36,128 --> 00:03:38,609
Now with mortgage rates
at an all-time low,

58
00:03:38,783 --> 00:03:41,786
and single-family developments
at an all time high,

59
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:44,528
my question for you
is, how do we make

60
00:03:44,702 --> 00:03:48,140
condo developments a
"can't miss" investment?

61
00:03:48,315 --> 00:03:50,795
Well, I believe the answer is

62
00:03:50,969 --> 00:03:54,973
to build a community complete
with every must-have amenity.

63
00:03:55,147 --> 00:03:59,848
Dedicated garages, pool, spa,
exercise gym, park spaces,

64
00:04:01,719 --> 00:04:03,155
a coffee shop.

65
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:05,810
Twin Pines is a
world unto itself.

66
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:12,077
- You're very... Sunny.

67
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:13,252
Aren't you?

68
00:04:14,297 --> 00:04:15,864
- [chuckles] Well, I try to be.

69
00:04:17,344 --> 00:04:19,084
- What about maintenance
fees and utilities?

70
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:22,174
- I have included the most
sustainable building methods.

71
00:04:22,349 --> 00:04:24,133
We have green roofs with solar,

72
00:04:24,307 --> 00:04:26,004
thermal cladding
on the exterior,

73
00:04:26,178 --> 00:04:28,833
and gray water plumbing
systems for irrigation

74
00:04:29,007 --> 00:04:30,792
for the green belts.

75
00:04:30,966 --> 00:04:34,839
I estimate that we can lower
common utility costs by 17%.

76
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:38,732
- I can't wait to start moving
these units for you, sir.

77
00:04:38,756 --> 00:04:40,299
I imagine we're gonna have
a waiting list of people

78
00:04:40,323 --> 00:04:42,499
wanting in on this community.

79
00:04:42,673 --> 00:04:43,848
- How many units?

80
00:04:44,022 --> 00:04:45,023
- 66.

81
00:04:46,764 --> 00:04:49,071
- That's 10 less
than we asked for.

82
00:04:49,245 --> 00:04:51,595
- Oh, if that's a deal breaker,

83
00:04:51,769 --> 00:04:54,946
then I'm sure we can get
those additional units back.

84
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:55,904
Right, Gemma?

85
00:04:56,078 --> 00:04:57,514
- We could.

86
00:04:58,907 --> 00:05:00,430
But, I don't believe

87
00:05:00,604 --> 00:05:02,324
it's the most aesthetically
pleasing option,

88
00:05:02,389 --> 00:05:07,394
or the best use of the
space, in my opinion.

89
00:05:07,568 --> 00:05:09,874
- Well in my opinion, I
think we're done here.

90
00:05:10,788 --> 00:05:11,833
- Oh, wait.

91
00:05:12,007 --> 00:05:13,530
Mr. Barrington.

92
00:05:13,704 --> 00:05:16,533
This is just our first
cut at the project.

93
00:05:16,707 --> 00:05:18,274
Why don't you give
us your notes,

94
00:05:18,448 --> 00:05:20,208
and we'll come back to
you with some revisions.

95
00:05:20,232 --> 00:05:21,886
- No, no no, that's
not necessary.

96
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:24,212
We're gonna go with the proposal
from Ken Jordan Architects.

97
00:05:24,236 --> 00:05:26,935
They seem to understand
our... sensibilities, better.

98
00:05:28,719 --> 00:05:29,719
- Good day.

99
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:33,507
[door opening]

100
00:05:37,032 --> 00:05:42,907
- I'm so... sorry, I really
thought that Twin Pines

101
00:05:43,081 --> 00:05:44,605
checked all of
Barrington's boxes.

102
00:05:44,779 --> 00:05:47,129
- He said 76 Units.

103
00:05:48,086 --> 00:05:50,088
You gave him 66.

104
00:05:51,002 --> 00:05:53,483
And hoped your creativity
could cover for it.

105
00:05:53,657 --> 00:05:57,008
- It's the best use
of the space, Darren.

106
00:05:57,182 --> 00:05:58,967
- Better for who?

107
00:05:59,141 --> 00:06:01,186
For Barrington?

108
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:03,014
Or for you?

109
00:06:04,276 --> 00:06:06,670
The client is always right.

110
00:06:08,106 --> 00:06:09,847
- Darren.

111
00:06:10,021 --> 00:06:11,632
I signed off on this design.

112
00:06:11,806 --> 00:06:13,634
I agreed with Gemma.

113
00:06:13,808 --> 00:06:16,506
- [chuckling] Well, it's not
benefiting anybody now, is it?

114
00:06:17,986 --> 00:06:19,306
All right, I'm
gonna go after him,

115
00:06:19,466 --> 00:06:20,791
to try to salvage
this opportunity.

116
00:06:20,815 --> 00:06:22,164
I put too much work in this.

117
00:06:22,338 --> 00:06:24,732
- You've put too
much work into this?

118
00:06:26,995 --> 00:06:34,263
[sad piano music]

119
00:06:34,437 --> 00:06:36,700
I really thought I checked
all the boxes, Patti.

120
00:06:36,874 --> 00:06:40,965
- Sometimes, I guess
the boxes we don't see

121
00:06:41,139 --> 00:06:43,228
are the ones that need
to be checked the most.

122
00:06:45,013 --> 00:06:47,711
[patting shoulder]

123
00:06:47,885 --> 00:06:55,885
[sad piano music]

124
00:06:56,067 --> 00:06:58,156
- I crashed and
burned, Auntie Lani.

125
00:06:58,330 --> 00:07:00,265
- [Auntie Lani] You don't
look burned to me, Peanut.

126
00:07:00,289 --> 00:07:01,682
You look beautiful.

127
00:07:01,856 --> 00:07:03,248
- Thank you, Auntie Lani.

128
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:04,863
- I know how hard
you worked on this,

129
00:07:04,902 --> 00:07:06,730
and I know how much
it means to you.

130
00:07:08,166 --> 00:07:09,994
- I just, I spent
so much time on it,

131
00:07:10,168 --> 00:07:12,127
and I thought that I nailed it.

132
00:07:12,301 --> 00:07:14,999
I even missed your special
birthday, and for what?

133
00:07:15,173 --> 00:07:17,045
It was all over in five minutes.

134
00:07:17,219 --> 00:07:18,873
- Chin up, young lady.

135
00:07:19,047 --> 00:07:20,657
Did you love how your
design turned out?

136
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:23,007
- I thought that I did.

137
00:07:23,181 --> 00:07:26,358
But now, I don't
know what to think.

138
00:07:26,533 --> 00:07:28,273
- Well, you just keep
doing what you love,

139
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:29,884
success will follow.

140
00:07:30,058 --> 00:07:31,058
I promise.

141
00:07:32,277 --> 00:07:34,410
- But I just really...
- No buts allowed.

142
00:07:34,584 --> 00:07:36,543
"Buts" just keep you
down in the dumps.

143
00:07:36,717 --> 00:07:39,154
"Yes ands" are what
keep you going.

144
00:07:39,328 --> 00:07:43,071
- [sighing] A little island
wisdom from the queen of Maui?

145
00:07:43,245 --> 00:07:45,160
- [chuckling]

146
00:07:45,334 --> 00:07:49,294
[speaking Hawaiian]

147
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:50,948
- What's that one?

148
00:07:51,122 --> 00:07:53,429
[chuckling] My Hawaiian's
a little rusty.

149
00:07:53,603 --> 00:07:55,736
- Come home more
often, it wouldn't be.

150
00:07:57,215 --> 00:08:00,392
What I said was, "Put
on your dancing shoes,

151
00:08:00,567 --> 00:08:02,960
and leave the shame at home."

152
00:08:03,134 --> 00:08:06,050
- Okay, I will.

153
00:08:06,224 --> 00:08:08,749
Hey, I love you, Auntie Lani.

154
00:08:08,923 --> 00:08:11,099
- [Woman] Lani, it's time!

155
00:08:11,273 --> 00:08:14,145
- I got a bunch of oldsters
waiting for me to play bingo.

156
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:15,364
I love you too, Peanut.

157
00:08:18,367 --> 00:08:20,064
[phone buzzing]

158
00:08:27,158 --> 00:08:28,986
[sighing]

159
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:35,123
[city noises]

160
00:08:36,167 --> 00:08:42,870
[footsteps]

161
00:08:43,044 --> 00:08:44,741
- Hey, thanks for the invite.

162
00:08:48,615 --> 00:08:51,095
- So, Patti told you they're
going with the other architect?

163
00:08:52,227 --> 00:08:53,315
- Yeah, she did.

164
00:08:54,969 --> 00:08:56,318
Are you gonna be okay?

165
00:08:57,362 --> 00:08:58,973
- I guess I have to be.

166
00:09:01,715 --> 00:09:04,239
They're also going with
another real estate agent.

167
00:09:04,413 --> 00:09:06,023
- Maybe I can talk to them

168
00:09:06,197 --> 00:09:08,237
and explain how my design
would really benefit them.

169
00:09:08,286 --> 00:09:12,116
- This could've been a year's
worth of living, for both of us.

170
00:09:12,290 --> 00:09:15,250
Put a lot of equity in
our relationship bank.

171
00:09:15,424 --> 00:09:17,818
- Well, never really thought
about our relationship

172
00:09:17,992 --> 00:09:20,821
like a checking account, but...

173
00:09:20,995 --> 00:09:22,779
I know something
else will come up.

174
00:09:22,953 --> 00:09:25,782
- I just didn't realize how
naive you can be, sometimes.

175
00:09:27,001 --> 00:09:28,698
- I'm not naive, Darren.

176
00:09:30,874 --> 00:09:33,137
Why are you talking
to me like this?

177
00:09:33,311 --> 00:09:35,009
- I'm frustrated we
lost the job, Gemma.

178
00:09:35,183 --> 00:09:37,489
- Yeah, so am I.

179
00:09:37,664 --> 00:09:40,144
But I didn't go to architecture
school for four years

180
00:09:40,318 --> 00:09:43,060
just to bury my
opinion in a meeting.

181
00:09:43,234 --> 00:09:45,585
- I think we should
slow things down.

182
00:09:47,064 --> 00:09:48,457
Take our time.

183
00:09:50,111 --> 00:09:51,373
- Right.

184
00:09:51,547 --> 00:09:53,941
'Cause four years
in a relationship

185
00:09:54,115 --> 00:09:56,030
is really rushing things.

186
00:09:57,335 --> 00:09:59,033
- Now you're being flighty.

187
00:10:00,251 --> 00:10:02,210
Sunny, and flighty.

188
00:10:04,516 --> 00:10:07,432
- No, I'm just being myself.

189
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:09,217
I'm being honest.

190
00:10:10,087 --> 00:10:12,176
And I won't apologize
for being me.

191
00:10:15,353 --> 00:10:18,443
Like you've been asking
me to do for years now.

192
00:10:21,098 --> 00:10:22,098
You know what, Darren?

193
00:10:24,188 --> 00:10:26,060
I'm done.

194
00:10:26,582 --> 00:10:27,603
- That's not what
I'm asking for.

195
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:29,846
- I know you're not.

196
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:32,414
It would be easier if you were.

197
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:37,767
I hope that you have the life
of your dreams, I really do.

198
00:10:37,941 --> 00:10:41,292
But I can see now that I
just can't be part of it.

199
00:10:44,252 --> 00:10:45,252
Goodbye, Darren.

200
00:10:46,428 --> 00:10:54,428
[light music]

201
00:11:01,356 --> 00:11:03,750
[door knocking]

202
00:11:04,707 --> 00:11:07,362
- What's wrong, now?

203
00:11:07,536 --> 00:11:09,494
- I just blew up my life.

204
00:11:10,321 --> 00:11:12,410
- Oh, boy.

205
00:11:12,584 --> 00:11:14,369
- You know, on the way
to lunch, I thought,

206
00:11:14,543 --> 00:11:16,806
"Everything's gonna be fine."

207
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:19,113
I even fantasized that today
was going to be the day

208
00:11:19,287 --> 00:11:20,984
that he popped the question.

209
00:11:21,158 --> 00:11:23,944
[crying]

210
00:11:24,118 --> 00:11:26,947
- I'm not really the
hugging type, but...

211
00:11:27,121 --> 00:11:29,689
We'll get you through this.

212
00:11:29,863 --> 00:11:32,126
I know you don't see
me as the P.J. wearing,

213
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:34,215
romcom marathon
watching type of girl,

214
00:11:34,389 --> 00:11:38,175
but when a man breaks my heart,
I break out the ice cream.

215
00:11:38,349 --> 00:11:39,437
[laughing]

216
00:11:39,611 --> 00:11:41,613
So, let's get you out of here

217
00:11:41,788 --> 00:11:43,228
and into the freezer
section, pronto.

218
00:11:43,311 --> 00:11:44,529
[phone buzzing]

219
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:46,053
- [sniffing] Just a sec.

220
00:11:48,098 --> 00:11:49,098
It's my sister.

221
00:11:50,492 --> 00:11:52,059
Hey, Sarah.

222
00:11:52,233 --> 00:11:54,365
- [Sarah] Gemma, how
fast can you get here?

223
00:11:54,539 --> 00:11:55,976
- Why, what happened?

224
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:57,281
- [Sarah] It's Auntie Lani.

225
00:11:57,455 --> 00:11:58,500
It was her heart.

226
00:11:58,674 --> 00:12:00,284
It finally gave out.

227
00:12:00,458 --> 00:12:03,026
- Wait, what?

228
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:06,377
No, no, I just talked
to her this morning.

229
00:12:06,551 --> 00:12:09,163
- [Sarah] She's gone, Gem.

230
00:12:09,337 --> 00:12:11,252
Dad is a wreck.

231
00:12:11,426 --> 00:12:13,036
Can you come home?

232
00:12:13,210 --> 00:12:15,299
Please?

233
00:12:15,473 --> 00:12:17,867
- I'll be on the
first flight out.

234
00:12:20,696 --> 00:12:26,702
[sobbing]

235
00:12:27,355 --> 00:12:29,313
[airplane engines]

236
00:12:32,795 --> 00:12:40,795
[piano music]

237
00:12:45,155 --> 00:12:48,245
[car door shutting]

238
00:12:48,419 --> 00:12:56,419
[sad music]

239
00:13:02,390 --> 00:13:04,435
- Thanks for getting
here so quickly.

240
00:13:04,609 --> 00:13:06,437
- How's dad doing?

241
00:13:06,611 --> 00:13:08,918
- He was having lunch with
Auntie Lani when it happened.

242
00:13:09,092 --> 00:13:12,704
- I'm just so grateful that
he was there with her when...

243
00:13:12,879 --> 00:13:15,577
[sighing] Dad went inside to
say hi to the airport manager.

244
00:13:17,361 --> 00:13:25,361
[sad music]

245
00:13:26,631 --> 00:13:29,286
- Good to see you, Peanut.

246
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:37,460
[sad music]

247
00:13:40,341 --> 00:13:42,038
- How you doin', Dad?

248
00:13:43,257 --> 00:13:46,390
- I'm, I'm hangin' in there.

249
00:13:46,564 --> 00:13:47,957
How 'bout you?

250
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:51,439
How 'bout you?

251
00:13:53,223 --> 00:13:54,223
Come on.

252
00:13:57,575 --> 00:14:01,057
It's a blessed day when
we're all together.

253
00:14:02,798 --> 00:14:07,455
[speaking Hawaiian]

254
00:14:07,629 --> 00:14:15,629
[sad music]

255
00:14:18,553 --> 00:14:19,946
Where's what's his name?

256
00:14:22,949 --> 00:14:25,212
- Things have changed
with Darren, Daddy.

257
00:14:28,563 --> 00:14:30,260
- Chee-hoo!

258
00:14:30,434 --> 00:14:32,088
- Daddy.

259
00:14:35,309 --> 00:14:37,137
- Come on.

260
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:45,145
[sad music]

261
00:14:45,319 --> 00:14:47,712
[car door shutting]

262
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:55,887
[sad music]

263
00:15:02,727 --> 00:15:04,599
- I forgot how much
I miss your baking.

264
00:15:04,773 --> 00:15:06,731
- [chuckling] Just
something I threw together.

265
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:08,037
- Hmm, really?

266
00:15:09,256 --> 00:15:10,256
- So?

267
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:12,520
Tell me everything.

268
00:15:14,087 --> 00:15:16,654
- I guess after four
years of dating,

269
00:15:16,828 --> 00:15:19,048
we just weren't growing
together as a couple anymore.

270
00:15:19,222 --> 00:15:22,617
- You do realize that
dating for four years

271
00:15:22,791 --> 00:15:25,359
is not really supposed
to be a thing, don't you?

272
00:15:25,533 --> 00:15:26,316
- It's not?

273
00:15:26,490 --> 00:15:28,318
- No.

274
00:15:28,492 --> 00:15:31,843
That's just sort of being
a... perpetual renter at love,

275
00:15:32,018 --> 00:15:35,108
but never really getting
your name on the mortgage.

276
00:15:36,805 --> 00:15:38,805
That is something that
Auntie Lani would have said.

277
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:41,375
[chuckling]

278
00:15:41,549 --> 00:15:43,159
I guess we were just
in kind of a rut.

279
00:15:43,333 --> 00:15:47,250
We didn't kiss as often, we
forgot to say "I love you..."

280
00:15:47,424 --> 00:15:48,208
A lot.

281
00:15:48,382 --> 00:15:49,731
- Girl.

282
00:15:49,905 --> 00:15:52,560
That's old, married
couple stuff. [giggling]

283
00:15:52,734 --> 00:15:54,214
Trust me.

284
00:15:54,388 --> 00:15:55,388
I know.

285
00:15:56,607 --> 00:16:00,481
But I got the ring, and
until death do us part,

286
00:16:02,004 --> 00:16:04,354
and that's what gets
you through the ruts.

287
00:16:05,486 --> 00:16:08,315
But sometimes, one step
back is two steps forward.

288
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:11,405
- See?

289
00:16:11,579 --> 00:16:13,059
- What?

290
00:16:13,233 --> 00:16:15,626
- That, is Auntie Lani
talking, right there.

291
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:20,631
I'm really gonna miss her.

292
00:16:24,418 --> 00:16:26,072
- Me, too.

293
00:16:28,422 --> 00:16:29,901
- Gemma.

294
00:16:30,076 --> 00:16:31,686
Oh, my God, it is
really good to see you.

295
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:33,296
- You, too.

296
00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:35,168
- Really.

297
00:16:35,342 --> 00:16:38,301
- [chuckling] Thank you for
looking after my elderly sister.

298
00:16:38,475 --> 00:16:40,390
- Hey! [laughing]

299
00:16:40,564 --> 00:16:41,564
- Where's Emma?

300
00:16:41,696 --> 00:16:43,089
- Well, on the way home,

301
00:16:43,263 --> 00:16:45,265
she saw some friends
surfing off road,

302
00:16:45,439 --> 00:16:47,789
so she's catching
a few more waves.

303
00:16:48,877 --> 00:16:51,793
Gem, you know you can stay here
as long as you want, right?

304
00:16:52,881 --> 00:16:55,275
- Thank you, but,

305
00:16:55,449 --> 00:16:58,147
I can only stay through
Auntie Lani's service.

306
00:16:58,321 --> 00:17:00,845
- Well, we'll just have to
make an island girl out of ya

307
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,543
while we have you.

308
00:17:02,717 --> 00:17:03,717
[chuckling]

309
00:17:03,805 --> 00:17:05,850
[birds chirping]

310
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:08,462
[ocean waves crashing]

311
00:17:08,636 --> 00:17:13,858
[people talking]

312
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:20,822
[Hawaiian music]

313
00:17:20,996 --> 00:17:22,867
- It is so nice that
everyone came out here

314
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:24,478
to celebrate Auntie Lani.

315
00:17:24,652 --> 00:17:27,611
- Yeah, she had a lot of
good family and friends.

316
00:17:27,785 --> 00:17:29,309
- Auntie Gemma!

317
00:17:29,483 --> 00:17:30,484
- Emma!

318
00:17:30,658 --> 00:17:31,658
Look at you.

319
00:17:32,921 --> 00:17:34,836
What happened to
that little girl?

320
00:17:35,010 --> 00:17:36,610
You're such a beautiful
young woman, now.

321
00:17:36,707 --> 00:17:38,535
- Mm-hmm.

322
00:17:38,709 --> 00:17:39,449
And that's what all the boys
at her school are saying, too.

323
00:17:39,623 --> 00:17:41,147
- Dad.

324
00:17:41,321 --> 00:17:43,279
Mom, can I go to the
movies with Kiki?

325
00:17:43,453 --> 00:17:44,976
- You most certainly can't.

326
00:17:45,151 --> 00:17:46,891
We're here for Auntie
Lani, remember?

327
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:48,719
[Emma groaning]

328
00:17:48,893 --> 00:17:51,287
But you may call Kiki to invite
her over to join you here.

329
00:17:51,461 --> 00:17:52,461
- Cool.

330
00:17:56,553 --> 00:17:58,473
- I just had a flashback
of you two as teenagers.

331
00:17:58,555 --> 00:18:00,122
- Aloha.

332
00:18:00,296 --> 00:18:02,733
It's certainly nice to
see the Ohana together.

333
00:18:02,907 --> 00:18:04,467
- Sarah, Gemma, this
is Franklin Decker,

334
00:18:04,518 --> 00:18:06,302
Auntie Lani's attorney.

335
00:18:06,476 --> 00:18:07,303
- Nice to meet you.

336
00:18:07,477 --> 00:18:08,870
- Nice to meet you.

337
00:18:09,044 --> 00:18:11,742
Your Auntie Lani,
she had two assets.

338
00:18:11,916 --> 00:18:14,789
One is her house, and
the other is the land

339
00:18:14,963 --> 00:18:17,008
that that house sits on.

340
00:18:17,183 --> 00:18:20,534
And we all understand how
much that land is worth

341
00:18:20,708 --> 00:18:22,275
compared to that structure.

342
00:18:22,449 --> 00:18:25,060
And the monies that she
did leave, she wanted,

343
00:18:25,234 --> 00:18:26,844
she wanted that
money to go towards

344
00:18:27,018 --> 00:18:29,369
the renovation of the house.

345
00:18:29,543 --> 00:18:31,849
- Auntie Lani loved
that old house.

346
00:18:32,023 --> 00:18:33,808
It would be a perfect
project for you, Dad.

347
00:18:33,982 --> 00:18:35,592
- [chuckling] Well, if I may,

348
00:18:35,766 --> 00:18:38,682
Auntie Lani had
something else in mind.

349
00:18:38,856 --> 00:18:40,989
Auntie Lani gave this
house to you, Gemma,

350
00:18:41,163 --> 00:18:43,383
and to you, Sarah.

351
00:18:43,557 --> 00:18:44,906
- What?
- What?

352
00:18:45,907 --> 00:18:47,387
- That house is a wreck.

353
00:18:47,561 --> 00:18:49,084
- Wait, Sarah.

354
00:18:49,258 --> 00:18:50,999
- Sorry, Dad, it's just
that after she moved

355
00:18:51,173 --> 00:18:54,045
into the retirement home,
the house sort of fell apart.

356
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:55,860
- Mr. Decker, did
Auntie Lani say anything

357
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:58,746
about what she wanted
us to do with the house?

358
00:18:58,920 --> 00:18:59,616
Sell it?

359
00:18:59,790 --> 00:19:01,357
- H-h-h-hold it.

360
00:19:01,531 --> 00:19:04,055
I can't believe you two
are talking like this.

361
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:06,580
Auntie Lani was
like a mom to you.

362
00:19:06,754 --> 00:19:09,148
Even after your own
mother passed away.

363
00:19:09,322 --> 00:19:11,889
If you decide to
sell this property,

364
00:19:12,063 --> 00:19:16,503
both you and Sarah will
share in the proceeds.

365
00:19:16,677 --> 00:19:17,765
But...

366
00:19:17,939 --> 00:19:19,593
- But what?

367
00:19:19,767 --> 00:19:22,770
- Gemma, you're gonna have
to renovate the property.

368
00:19:22,944 --> 00:19:24,511
- What?
- What?

369
00:19:24,685 --> 00:19:27,078
- If you want to
sell this property,

370
00:19:27,253 --> 00:19:31,866
your auntie wanted Gemma
to oversee the work.

371
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:35,739
Otherwise, this
house cannot be sold.

372
00:19:35,913 --> 00:19:38,307
- But I have to go back to the
mainland after the service.

373
00:19:38,481 --> 00:19:40,657
I can't stay and
renovate the house.

374
00:19:40,831 --> 00:19:42,746
- Yeah, but, if you
think about it, Gemma,

375
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:44,661
it's kind of the perfect plan.

376
00:19:44,835 --> 00:19:46,576
You're an amazing
architect and designer.

377
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:49,100
- Well, you know what's not
perfect about that plan?

378
00:19:49,275 --> 00:19:51,015
That I have a job
to get back to.

379
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:52,452
And Auntie Lani knew that.

380
00:19:52,626 --> 00:19:54,671
I don't know what
she was thinking.

381
00:19:54,845 --> 00:19:57,544
Renovating that house could
take weeks, even months.

382
00:19:57,718 --> 00:19:59,241
- I get it.

383
00:19:59,415 --> 00:20:01,200
I understand, but your
auntie was very clear.

384
00:20:01,374 --> 00:20:04,899
And once you finish the
work, once you're done,

385
00:20:05,073 --> 00:20:09,120
then both you and Sarah can
either sell it, rent it,

386
00:20:09,295 --> 00:20:13,690
or move into it, it's
completely your choice.

387
00:20:13,864 --> 00:20:18,086
- Well, if I agree to do this,
I'm gonna need a contractor.

388
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:20,480
- [chuckling] Well, your
auntie was so akamai,

389
00:20:20,654 --> 00:20:24,875
she was so smart, that she
had already planned this.

390
00:20:25,049 --> 00:20:26,442
Well, I took the liberty

391
00:20:26,616 --> 00:20:28,357
in inviting this
gentleman here, today.

392
00:20:29,793 --> 00:20:30,793
- Ben!

393
00:20:31,621 --> 00:20:32,621
- Emma.

394
00:20:33,667 --> 00:20:34,667
- Ben?!

395
00:20:35,843 --> 00:20:36,843
Hi!

396
00:20:37,671 --> 00:20:43,894
[upbeat music]

397
00:20:44,068 --> 00:20:47,376
- She wanted to
hire Ben Fincher?

398
00:20:47,550 --> 00:20:50,336
- Well, your auntie was very
explicit as to who she wanted.

399
00:20:50,510 --> 00:20:51,835
- Wait, didn't Gemma
date him in high school?

400
00:20:51,859 --> 00:20:52,686
- Shh!

401
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:54,557
[clearing throat]

402
00:20:54,731 --> 00:20:56,143
- [nervous chuckling]
Please, dear God,

403
00:20:56,167 --> 00:20:58,866
tell me that I'm being pranked.

404
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:05,786
[upbeat music]

405
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:07,048
- Aloha, Gemma.

406
00:21:07,222 --> 00:21:08,963
- Ben.

407
00:21:09,137 --> 00:21:10,747
- Long time, no see.

408
00:21:10,921 --> 00:21:12,532
- Not long enough.

409
00:21:13,359 --> 00:21:14,559
- Still holding a grudge, huh?

410
00:21:14,708 --> 00:21:15,186
- Me?

411
00:21:15,361 --> 00:21:16,840
No.

412
00:21:17,014 --> 00:21:18,122
Every 17-year-old girl
should get stood up

413
00:21:18,146 --> 00:21:19,186
by their homecoming crush.

414
00:21:19,321 --> 00:21:22,193
Have to dance all by themselves.

415
00:21:22,368 --> 00:21:23,910
- It's not like I was
off with another girl.

416
00:21:23,934 --> 00:21:27,024
- Oh, well, maybe
not technically, but,

417
00:21:27,198 --> 00:21:28,939
leaving me to go
surfing is pretty much

418
00:21:29,113 --> 00:21:30,193
the same thing as cheating.

419
00:21:30,245 --> 00:21:32,029
- Cheating?

420
00:21:32,203 --> 00:21:35,206
I was competing in the state
surf championships in Oahu.

421
00:21:35,381 --> 00:21:37,731
- Let's not quibble
over the details.

422
00:21:37,905 --> 00:21:40,864
It's all water under
the heartbreak bridge.

423
00:21:41,038 --> 00:21:42,083
- [sighing] Great.

424
00:21:44,215 --> 00:21:48,176
You know, I was really sorry
to hear about your Aunt Lani.

425
00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:51,571
She was... one special lady.

426
00:21:51,745 --> 00:21:53,094
- Yeah, she really was.

427
00:21:56,010 --> 00:22:00,449
How exactly did she choose
you to be the contractor?

428
00:22:00,623 --> 00:22:02,297
- Believe me, I was just as
surprised as you to find out

429
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:03,800
that she wanted me.

430
00:22:03,974 --> 00:22:05,759
- Oh, so you were just
as ambushed as I was

431
00:22:05,933 --> 00:22:07,891
with this whole
renovation project.

432
00:22:08,065 --> 00:22:10,677
- I wouldn't say I was ambushed,
I was thrilled she asked me.

433
00:22:10,851 --> 00:22:13,027
Using my hands to
make old things new,

434
00:22:13,201 --> 00:22:14,811
that's what I was made to do.

435
00:22:14,985 --> 00:22:17,597
- Well, my life in L.A.
is what I was made to do,

436
00:22:17,771 --> 00:22:18,878
and I need to get back there.

437
00:22:18,902 --> 00:22:19,903
So...

438
00:22:20,077 --> 00:22:21,644
- Hey.

439
00:22:21,818 --> 00:22:23,820
- Let's get this thing
done like, yesterday.

440
00:22:23,994 --> 00:22:25,474
- Yes, ma'am.

441
00:22:25,648 --> 00:22:27,650
Hey, you know, this
could be kinda nice.

442
00:22:28,869 --> 00:22:30,479
If you just forgave me.

443
00:22:31,741 --> 00:22:32,307
- I'll think about it.

444
00:22:32,481 --> 00:22:34,178
- Good.

445
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:35,939
And I hope life has treated
you more kindly in the 15 years

446
00:22:35,963 --> 00:22:37,791
since I cheated on
you, with the ocean.

447
00:22:37,965 --> 00:22:39,053
- Absolutely.

448
00:22:39,227 --> 00:22:40,968
Could not be better.

449
00:22:41,142 --> 00:22:47,322
- Yeah, I, Lani told me that you
work in L.A. as an architect.

450
00:22:47,496 --> 00:22:51,195
- Wow, well, I'm glad my life
was a topic of conversation.

451
00:22:54,285 --> 00:22:56,940
What else did Auntie Lani say?

452
00:22:57,114 --> 00:23:03,077
- Well, just that she wasn't too
fond of your boyfriend, Darren.

453
00:23:03,251 --> 00:23:04,948
- Wow, was nothing off-limits?

454
00:23:06,472 --> 00:23:10,214
And, for your info,
former boyfriend.

455
00:23:10,389 --> 00:23:12,652
- Oh, ah...

456
00:23:12,826 --> 00:23:14,480
Sorry.

457
00:23:14,654 --> 00:23:17,134
- Did Auntie Lani have any
advice about your life?

458
00:23:19,223 --> 00:23:20,529
- Maybe, a little.

459
00:23:21,835 --> 00:23:23,358
- Oh.

460
00:23:23,532 --> 00:23:25,252
So when it's questions
about you, you become

461
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:26,840
all man of few words.

462
00:23:27,014 --> 00:23:29,320
- Fair enough.

463
00:23:29,495 --> 00:23:32,628
Yes, she was a little concerned
that in the last 15 years,

464
00:23:32,802 --> 00:23:34,587
I hadn't found the
right woman yet,

465
00:23:34,761 --> 00:23:38,591
but I assured her that I love
being a contractor and ah,

466
00:23:40,157 --> 00:23:41,550
my life is perfect.

467
00:23:42,421 --> 00:23:44,901
- Mm, so...

468
00:23:45,075 --> 00:23:46,816
Ambushed, or not ambushed?

469
00:23:49,863 --> 00:23:50,951
- Okay, ambushed.

470
00:23:51,125 --> 00:23:53,214
[chuckling]

471
00:23:56,913 --> 00:23:59,220
So, tomorrow, bright and early?

472
00:24:00,961 --> 00:24:01,961
- Count on it.

473
00:24:02,049 --> 00:24:04,094
- Great.

474
00:24:04,268 --> 00:24:09,273
[music and talking]

475
00:24:09,448 --> 00:24:11,058
- Okay.

476
00:24:14,409 --> 00:24:16,169
I'm only here 'til we're
ready to flip the house,

477
00:24:16,193 --> 00:24:18,631
and then I'm on the
first plane out.

478
00:24:19,545 --> 00:24:22,373
- [sighing] So focus on that.

479
00:24:22,548 --> 00:24:25,899
Besides, you know you
love that old house.

480
00:24:26,073 --> 00:24:28,554
- [chuckling] That
was a long time ago.

481
00:24:28,728 --> 00:24:30,096
- You and dad would
be there all the time,

482
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:31,948
fixing stuff for Auntie Lani.

483
00:24:32,122 --> 00:24:33,863
[laughing] You were
such a little tomboy.

484
00:24:34,037 --> 00:24:35,038
- What?

485
00:24:35,212 --> 00:24:37,301
I was not a tomboy.

486
00:24:37,476 --> 00:24:38,302
Okay, fine, maybe.

487
00:24:38,477 --> 00:24:40,261
Just like, a little bit.

488
00:24:40,435 --> 00:24:42,350
But I didn't have mom
around to pamper me

489
00:24:42,524 --> 00:24:44,134
when I was younger,
like you did.

490
00:24:46,963 --> 00:24:49,749
[sighing]

491
00:24:49,923 --> 00:24:51,315
- That's true.

492
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:52,665
And teach me how to bake.

493
00:24:54,536 --> 00:24:57,365
- Sarah, you were born to bake.

494
00:24:57,539 --> 00:24:59,802
Mom knew that.

495
00:24:59,976 --> 00:25:02,196
- She knew you would
become an architect.

496
00:25:02,370 --> 00:25:04,067
- Really?

497
00:25:05,112 --> 00:25:06,200
You think so?

498
00:25:06,374 --> 00:25:07,810
- You were born for it.

499
00:25:07,984 --> 00:25:09,788
Remember Auntie Lani had
Dad's old Tinker Toy set

500
00:25:09,812 --> 00:25:11,335
at her house, from
when he was a boy?

501
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:12,815
[chuckling]

502
00:25:12,989 --> 00:25:16,036
Well, you were a
whiz with those.

503
00:25:16,210 --> 00:25:20,040
So when you think about it,
there's no conspiracy here.

504
00:25:20,214 --> 00:25:22,869
Auntie Lani chose you to
renovate her house because...

505
00:25:24,174 --> 00:25:27,395
there's no better
person to do it.

506
00:25:27,569 --> 00:25:29,286
Of course it doesn't
explain why she matched you

507
00:25:29,310 --> 00:25:31,747
with the hottest contractor
on Maui to help you.

508
00:25:31,921 --> 00:25:33,662
- Okay.

509
00:25:33,836 --> 00:25:35,751
- And the last time
I saw that place...

510
00:25:37,144 --> 00:25:40,408
[groans] Well, put it this way.

511
00:25:40,582 --> 00:25:42,192
You got your work
cut out for you.

512
00:25:42,366 --> 00:25:44,325
- It can't be that bad.

513
00:25:47,154 --> 00:25:49,243
[sighing]

514
00:25:49,417 --> 00:25:53,203
Okay, it is a dump.

515
00:25:53,377 --> 00:25:57,338
- [sighs] yeah, it went to pot
after Auntie Lani moved out.

516
00:25:57,512 --> 00:25:59,296
If you listen carefully,

517
00:25:59,470 --> 00:26:02,125
you can almost hear
the structure groaning.

518
00:26:02,299 --> 00:26:06,173
- No, I actually think
that's me groaning.

519
00:26:06,347 --> 00:26:07,827
- It'll be fine.

520
00:26:08,001 --> 00:26:09,500
A little elbow grease
and, good as new.

521
00:26:09,524 --> 00:26:12,875
- Oh, you mean my elbow grease.

522
00:26:13,049 --> 00:26:15,051
- Glad you could make it.

523
00:26:15,225 --> 00:26:16,749
Was taking a look at the siding.

524
00:26:16,923 --> 00:26:19,012
Only gonna need a few
slats here and there.

525
00:26:19,186 --> 00:26:20,840
- I thought we beat you here.

526
00:26:21,014 --> 00:26:24,060
- Yeah, well contractors do
get a bad rap for being late.

527
00:26:24,234 --> 00:26:25,932
I believe in being early.

528
00:26:28,064 --> 00:26:29,892
- Well, except homecoming.

529
00:26:30,066 --> 00:26:32,155
- Ouch.

530
00:26:32,329 --> 00:26:33,568
- I don't think you're out
of the woods just yet, Ben.

531
00:26:33,592 --> 00:26:35,158
- Nope, he's fine.

532
00:26:35,332 --> 00:26:37,813
I'm just kidding, no woods here.

533
00:26:37,987 --> 00:26:39,206
- Good.

534
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:41,817
I promise not to be
late to this dance.

535
00:26:48,694 --> 00:26:51,392
- Well, I guess that's
my cue to leave.

536
00:26:52,436 --> 00:26:54,134
Have fun, sis.

537
00:26:59,618 --> 00:27:01,750
- Absolutely beautiful.

538
00:27:03,317 --> 00:27:06,755
- We are talking about
this house, right?

539
00:27:06,929 --> 00:27:09,169
- The house was damaged from
a hurricane a few years ago,

540
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:12,326
but, look at this old soul.

541
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:13,849
Given up so much of herself,

542
00:27:14,023 --> 00:27:16,069
it'll appear she doesn't
have much left, but,

543
00:27:17,070 --> 00:27:19,376
it couldn't be further
from the truth.

544
00:27:19,550 --> 00:27:22,466
A little broken, but
she's still standing tall.

545
00:27:24,207 --> 00:27:26,087
We just need to remind
her of what she once was,

546
00:27:26,253 --> 00:27:28,908
and what she could be again.

547
00:27:29,996 --> 00:27:32,520
- Well, I think it's a
little more of a refresh

548
00:27:32,694 --> 00:27:34,565
than a square one redo.

549
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:36,872
- You haven't seen
inside yet, have you?

550
00:27:37,046 --> 00:27:38,439
- No.

551
00:27:39,266 --> 00:27:41,137
I just want to honor
what my auntie asked for.

552
00:27:41,311 --> 00:27:44,358
Nothing more, nothing less,
so let's keep it professional.

553
00:27:44,532 --> 00:27:47,883
Stay on the clock, so we can
both get back to our life.

554
00:27:49,624 --> 00:27:51,191
ASAP.

555
00:27:51,365 --> 00:27:53,193
- You're the boss.

556
00:27:53,367 --> 00:27:54,367
- Yes, I am.

557
00:27:57,414 --> 00:27:59,155
[door cracking]

558
00:27:59,329 --> 00:28:00,461
- Whoa, whoa!

559
00:28:00,635 --> 00:28:02,942
Let me get that for ya.

560
00:28:03,116 --> 00:28:11,116
[upbeat music]

561
00:28:12,299 --> 00:28:13,299
- Wow.

562
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:17,478
This is not how I remember it.

563
00:28:17,652 --> 00:28:20,307
- Yeah, it happens when
they sit empty for too long.

564
00:28:20,481 --> 00:28:23,353
This place hasn't seen any TLC
since your auntie moved out.

565
00:28:23,527 --> 00:28:25,094
- Eight years ago.

566
00:28:26,356 --> 00:28:27,053
[paper tearing]

567
00:28:27,227 --> 00:28:28,228
Oh!

568
00:28:29,359 --> 00:28:31,144
[chuckling]

569
00:28:31,318 --> 00:28:32,318
Thanks.

570
00:28:32,406 --> 00:28:33,799
- Yeah, no problem.

571
00:28:36,192 --> 00:28:38,281
[clearing throat]

572
00:28:38,455 --> 00:28:40,631
- It's gonna need
a whole new floor.

573
00:28:40,806 --> 00:28:42,982
- Yeah, but we can just
tear up the linoleum and-

574
00:28:43,156 --> 00:28:44,548
- Replace it with a new tile.

575
00:28:44,723 --> 00:28:45,723
- Exactly.

576
00:28:45,811 --> 00:28:47,421
It'll look good as new.

577
00:28:47,595 --> 00:28:49,379
[chuckling] Maybe
I should go first.

578
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:53,514
[phone ringing]

579
00:28:56,909 --> 00:28:59,738
- Wow, the kitchen
is a complete redo.

580
00:29:01,696 --> 00:29:03,654
What do you say we
knock this wall out,

581
00:29:03,829 --> 00:29:06,222
and really open up this room.

582
00:29:06,396 --> 00:29:08,355
- Refresh, not redo.

583
00:29:08,529 --> 00:29:09,573
Remember?

584
00:29:09,748 --> 00:29:11,271
- Sorry, I see it up here.

585
00:29:11,445 --> 00:29:14,535
This house knows
what it wants to be.

586
00:29:14,709 --> 00:29:16,406
It's my job to bring it to life.

587
00:29:28,375 --> 00:29:31,595
- Just, keep that
window where it is.

588
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:33,380
- You sure?

589
00:29:35,425 --> 00:29:38,080
- One of my favorite
things as a kid,

590
00:29:38,254 --> 00:29:40,909
Auntie Lani and I used
to just stand here

591
00:29:41,083 --> 00:29:44,391
and spot the whales
breaching off shore.

592
00:29:45,609 --> 00:29:47,568
- Alright, then I say
we keep the whale window

593
00:29:47,742 --> 00:29:50,310
but we make it bigger.

594
00:29:50,484 --> 00:29:58,057
[soft music]

595
00:29:58,231 --> 00:30:00,581
- I like it.

596
00:30:00,755 --> 00:30:04,890
Auntie Lani would have loved
the whole open floor plan.

597
00:30:05,064 --> 00:30:06,650
She spent most of her
time outside on the beach.

598
00:30:06,674 --> 00:30:08,415
- Exactly.

599
00:30:08,589 --> 00:30:11,853
So let's make her interior an
extension of the outside world.

600
00:30:13,550 --> 00:30:16,075
Wait a minute, are we
fixing this place up for you

601
00:30:16,249 --> 00:30:18,381
or to sell to some nice couple?

602
00:30:21,689 --> 00:30:23,386
- Let's check out the backyard.

603
00:30:24,387 --> 00:30:26,128
- Okay.

604
00:30:26,302 --> 00:30:34,302
[waves crashing and music]

605
00:30:36,356 --> 00:30:44,356
[waves crashing and music]

606
00:30:47,584 --> 00:30:51,153
- We'll have to replace
this deck, dry rot.

607
00:30:51,327 --> 00:30:53,329
We can use composite
wood, it weathers better.

608
00:30:53,503 --> 00:30:55,264
- We could just replace
it with some simple steps

609
00:30:55,288 --> 00:30:57,420
leading up to the door.

610
00:30:57,594 --> 00:30:59,988
- And not have a
back lanai in Maui?

611
00:31:00,162 --> 00:31:02,295
- It'll give it
more backyard space.

612
00:31:02,469 --> 00:31:04,688
- Space is one thing
this place has plenty of.

613
00:31:04,863 --> 00:31:06,995
Okay, we keep the lanai.

614
00:31:07,169 --> 00:31:08,779
Family needs a place
to sit and barbecue

615
00:31:08,954 --> 00:31:10,651
and tell embarrassing stories.

616
00:31:13,959 --> 00:31:17,005
- I think that's your
magical picture, not mine.

617
00:31:21,531 --> 00:31:28,712
[waves crashing and music]

618
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:33,021
[footsteps]

619
00:31:33,195 --> 00:31:36,851
- I wanna get rid of the
fireplace so just box it in.

620
00:31:37,025 --> 00:31:38,916
- Gemma, it's the best
feature in the entire house

621
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:41,203
and you want to
make it disappear?

622
00:31:41,377 --> 00:31:44,598
Look. Look at the character
in that old brick.

623
00:31:44,772 --> 00:31:46,165
- You mean the cracks?

624
00:31:46,339 --> 00:31:48,123
- I mean the character.

625
00:31:48,297 --> 00:31:52,475
- No one in Hawaii needs a
fireplace so just cover it up.

626
00:31:52,649 --> 00:31:54,671
And I don't want any of the
walls knocked down either, okay?

627
00:31:54,695 --> 00:31:57,219
It's too time-consuming.

628
00:31:57,393 --> 00:31:59,395
- But what about what
the house wants to be?

629
00:31:59,569 --> 00:32:01,832
- Every change costs
time and money.

630
00:32:02,007 --> 00:32:03,443
And I don't have
a lot of either.

631
00:32:03,617 --> 00:32:04,899
- Okay look, I have
never gone over budget

632
00:32:04,923 --> 00:32:06,620
on any of my jobs.

633
00:32:06,794 --> 00:32:11,059
I can stretch the money if
you can stretch the time.

634
00:32:11,233 --> 00:32:14,193
- Time is the one thing
that I don't have a lot of.

635
00:32:15,411 --> 00:32:18,066
I need to get back to
my real life in LA.

636
00:32:19,633 --> 00:32:24,116
[footsteps]

637
00:32:24,290 --> 00:32:26,901
Hey, can you just give me a
ride back to my sister's place?

638
00:32:27,075 --> 00:32:28,515
- Gemma wait, can
we talk about this?

639
00:32:28,685 --> 00:32:29,967
I mean, I don't know
what happened in there

640
00:32:29,991 --> 00:32:31,471
but did I offend you somehow?

641
00:32:31,645 --> 00:32:33,125
- Just business.

642
00:32:33,299 --> 00:32:34,798
Apparently we just
have different opinions

643
00:32:34,822 --> 00:32:36,258
about how it should be done.

644
00:32:36,432 --> 00:32:38,032
- It's never just
business for me, Gemma.

645
00:32:38,086 --> 00:32:39,958
I don't do this work
just for the paycheck.

646
00:32:40,132 --> 00:32:41,544
Probably no more than
you design buildings

647
00:32:41,568 --> 00:32:42,917
just for a paycheck.

648
00:32:43,091 --> 00:32:45,093
- You don't know me
well enough to say that.

649
00:32:45,267 --> 00:32:46,877
- You know what,
you're right, I don't.

650
00:32:47,052 --> 00:32:48,879
But a job should be done right

651
00:32:49,054 --> 00:32:50,857
and for a minute there I thought
you and I were on the same page

652
00:32:50,881 --> 00:32:53,667
but it's just starting
to seem like you're not.

653
00:32:53,841 --> 00:32:55,364
- You know what, Ben?

654
00:32:55,538 --> 00:32:59,629
I appreciate your opinion,
but it's my house.

655
00:32:59,803 --> 00:33:01,240
- Maybe it's none
of my business.

656
00:33:01,414 --> 00:33:02,806
- You're right.

657
00:33:03,938 --> 00:33:05,418
It is none of your business.

658
00:33:07,724 --> 00:33:09,117
- Fair enough.

659
00:33:12,077 --> 00:33:13,445
- I guess you're not
familiar with the idea

660
00:33:13,469 --> 00:33:16,559
that the client is always right.

661
00:33:16,733 --> 00:33:19,127
- No, I get it.

662
00:33:19,301 --> 00:33:21,912
And that's the part of
my job I hate the most.

663
00:33:22,087 --> 00:33:24,350
Know-it-alls dictating where
the next nail's gonna go.

664
00:33:24,524 --> 00:33:25,307
But you know what?

665
00:33:25,481 --> 00:33:27,005
Life is too short.

666
00:33:27,179 --> 00:33:29,179
If the client knew it all
they wouldn't come to me.

667
00:33:30,486 --> 00:33:32,749
If that's the way you
want it then, sorry.

668
00:33:34,316 --> 00:33:37,493
I'm just not the right
guy for this job.

669
00:33:37,667 --> 00:33:38,667
- It's your choice.

670
00:33:46,024 --> 00:33:47,634
[door slams]

671
00:33:47,808 --> 00:33:54,467
[gentle music]

672
00:33:54,641 --> 00:34:01,474
[scraping sound]

673
00:34:01,648 --> 00:34:02,779
- Hey, Dad.

674
00:34:02,953 --> 00:34:04,433
Can I talk to you for a minute?

675
00:34:04,607 --> 00:34:06,914
- Got as many minutes
as you want, my dear.

676
00:34:07,088 --> 00:34:08,524
- Whatcha working on?

677
00:34:08,698 --> 00:34:11,614
- Coffee table for Auntie Lani.

678
00:34:11,788 --> 00:34:14,835
It was supposed to be in her
room at the retirement home.

679
00:34:15,662 --> 00:34:17,185
This lovely piece of wood

680
00:34:17,359 --> 00:34:19,709
came from her favorite
tree on the property.

681
00:34:20,797 --> 00:34:22,253
- And it'll be perfect
to have something

682
00:34:22,277 --> 00:34:24,584
to remember her by
after we sell the house.

683
00:34:26,064 --> 00:34:28,370
- Yeah, maybe so.

684
00:34:28,544 --> 00:34:30,459
- That is if we sell the house.

685
00:34:32,026 --> 00:34:33,810
- Wait a minute, what
are you talking about?

686
00:34:33,984 --> 00:34:36,509
- Ben and I weren't exactly
seeing eye-to-eye on the reno

687
00:34:36,683 --> 00:34:38,554
and he quit.

688
00:34:38,728 --> 00:34:41,098
- Wait a minute, wait a minute,
I know Ben, he's not a quitter.

689
00:34:41,122 --> 00:34:42,384
- Yeah, well, he quit, Dad.

690
00:34:42,558 --> 00:34:43,558
He did.

691
00:34:44,082 --> 00:34:45,648
- You know, are you sure?

692
00:34:45,822 --> 00:34:47,520
'Cause he's not
that kind of guy.

693
00:34:50,697 --> 00:34:52,307
- I may have fired him.

694
00:34:54,570 --> 00:34:56,920
- Ahhh, that doesn't
sound like you either.

695
00:34:58,444 --> 00:35:00,359
[sigh]

696
00:35:00,533 --> 00:35:02,491
I'm really sorry
about that, Gemma.

697
00:35:02,665 --> 00:35:04,730
You know Auntie Lani wanted
Ben to do the renovations

698
00:35:04,754 --> 00:35:06,800
so maybe we'll give
Franklin a call

699
00:35:06,974 --> 00:35:08,541
and see how flexible the will is

700
00:35:08,715 --> 00:35:10,499
and maybe we'll get
somebody else, okay?

701
00:35:10,673 --> 00:35:12,633
- Yeah, it seems like it's
gonna take a lot longer

702
00:35:12,762 --> 00:35:16,853
than we thought and I
really need to get home.

703
00:35:17,027 --> 00:35:19,726
- I always felt
Maui is your home.

704
00:35:21,858 --> 00:35:28,604
You may live over there, but
Maui will always be your home.

705
00:35:28,778 --> 00:35:30,954
- You know what I mean, Dad.

706
00:35:31,129 --> 00:35:32,869
I really need to get back.

707
00:35:35,568 --> 00:35:37,613
I still think that you
should finish the house

708
00:35:37,787 --> 00:35:38,440
and live there yourself.

709
00:35:38,614 --> 00:35:39,615

Are you kidding?

711
00:35:41,356 --> 00:35:43,402
And give up living
in my RV, Betty Lou?

712
00:35:43,576 --> 00:35:44,620
No way, brah.

713
00:35:44,794 --> 00:35:45,794
Ha ha ha.

00:35:46,709 --> 00:35:48,276

722
00:36:05,250 --> 00:36:08,688
- You know, Auntie Lani
did not leave me the house.

723
00:36:08,862 --> 00:36:11,865
She left it to you and
your sister to decide

724
00:36:12,039 --> 00:36:14,911
what the right thing is to do.

725
00:36:15,085 --> 00:36:16,739
And I know your
sister has this dream

726
00:36:16,913 --> 00:36:18,611
about opening up a bakery-

727
00:36:18,785 --> 00:36:20,874
- Wait, what?

728
00:36:21,048 --> 00:36:22,354
She never told me about that.

729
00:36:22,528 --> 00:36:23,964
- Yeah, well Emma's
getting older

730
00:36:24,138 --> 00:36:25,768
and one day she's gonna
leave the nest and

731
00:36:25,792 --> 00:36:29,752
well, your sister is
gonna need a purpose.

732
00:36:29,926 --> 00:36:30,971
- Don't we all, sometimes.

733
00:36:34,496 --> 00:36:36,759
Alright, well I guess
I better go figure out

734
00:36:36,933 --> 00:36:38,631
what my options are.

735
00:36:39,501 --> 00:36:46,465
- You know, Gemma, all I've
ever wanted for my girls

736
00:36:46,639 --> 00:36:49,511
was for them to be happy.

737
00:36:49,685 --> 00:36:51,774
- We know that, Daddy.

738
00:36:51,948 --> 00:36:53,341
We want the same thing for you.

739
00:36:58,694 --> 00:36:59,694

740
00:37:01,001 --> 00:37:02,002

might be a time in your life

757
00:39:14,787 --> 00:39:21,054
where you could give a guy
a second chance like Ben?

758
00:39:21,228 --> 00:39:23,273
- Dad, I think he
might be a little nuts.

759
00:39:23,448 --> 00:39:27,147
I mean, he keeps referring to
Auntie Lani's house as a she.

760
00:39:27,321 --> 00:39:28,321
- Ah.

761
00:39:29,410 --> 00:39:31,586
Like I refer to my
hale, as Betty Lou.

763
00:39:36,112 --> 00:39:37,940

Auntie Lani chose Ben

764
00:39:38,114 --> 00:39:41,509
to do the renovation
on her house?

765
00:39:41,683 --> 00:39:44,251
- I think I have a
pretty good idea.

766
00:39:44,425 --> 00:39:46,272
- No, not because you were
sweet on him in high school.

767
00:39:46,296 --> 00:39:47,863
That might've been a part of it.

768
00:39:49,082 --> 00:39:54,957
But because Ben told Auntie Lani
that her home was her legacy.

00:39:55,131 --> 00:39:59,092
For our whole family, our ohana

least a hundred years.

771

772
00:40:07,013 --> 00:40:08,536
- Yeah, he said that.

773
00:40:12,061 --> 00:40:13,061

00:40:17,458 --> 00:40:19,155
- Hey, Ben?

00:40:24,857 --> 00:40:26,075
- Hey.

777
00:40:26,249 --> 00:40:27,860
It's a beautiful service.

778
00:40:28,034 --> 00:40:29,688
- Thank you.

779
00:40:30,471 --> 00:40:33,779
I actually wanted to apologize.

780

You were right.

it's not your show.

Hey, Emma?

00:41:36,929 --> 00:41:37,929
- Yeah?

799
00:41:38,060 --> 00:41:39,409
I need to ask you a favor.

800
00:41:39,584 --> 00:41:40,944
Could you take a
look at my laptop?

801
00:41:41,020 --> 00:41:42,195
I think it crashed.

00:41:43,936 --> 00:41:45,764
- Yeah.

804
00:41:45,938 --> 00:41:48,375
And there is an email on there
that I really need to open.

805
00:41:48,549 --> 00:41:49,549
- Well, who is it from?

806
00:41:51,117 --> 00:41:53,119
- If I say you're
gonna think I'm crazy.

807
00:41:53,293 --> 00:41:56,601
- I already think that, but
it could be a phishing scam

808
00:41:56,775 --> 00:41:58,211
that ghosted your
operating system.

809
00:41:58,385 --> 00:42:00,082
- Ghosted?

810
00:42:00,256 --> 00:42:01,649
Okay, that does not sound good.

811
00:42:01,823 --> 00:42:04,304
- Or well-deserved
karma for firing Ben.

812
00:42:05,566 --> 00:42:07,394

was gonna be so hot.

[sighs]

893
00:46:47,674 --> 00:46:48,414
- It was a good day.

894
00:46:48,588 --> 00:46:49,937
- Yeah.

895
00:46:51,896 --> 00:46:53,941
You swing a mean sledgehammer.

896
00:46:54,115 --> 00:46:57,162
- Not gonna lie, it
felt really good.

897
00:46:58,554 --> 00:46:59,991
- Yeah, there's
nothing I love more

898
00:47:00,165 --> 00:47:01,725
than breathing new
life into old things.

899
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:06,040
- Hey, can I ask you a question?

900
00:47:06,214 --> 00:47:07,912
- Yeah.

901
00:47:08,086 --> 00:47:10,392
- What happened to
you after high school?

902
00:47:10,566 --> 00:47:13,004
- Well, after knocking around
the surf circuit for awhile

903
00:47:13,178 --> 00:47:15,484
and realizing there was
probably more to life,

904
00:47:15,658 --> 00:47:17,747
I went to college in New York.

905
00:47:17,922 --> 00:47:19,967
I ended up getting a
minor in 17th-century

906
00:47:20,141 --> 00:47:21,553
Eastern-European
Romantic literature.

907
00:47:21,577 --> 00:47:22,665
- Ha.

908
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:24,580
Well, that explains a lot.

909
00:47:25,973 --> 00:47:27,409
- Then I got a
job in billboards.

910
00:47:27,583 --> 00:47:29,150
- Billboards?

911
00:47:29,324 --> 00:47:31,152
- Advertising...
billboard space.

912
00:47:31,326 --> 00:47:34,286
I hated it.

913
00:47:34,460 --> 00:47:36,984
I was basically creating
mindless slogans

914
00:47:37,158 --> 00:47:40,509
for people to look at for two
seconds as they drove past.

915
00:47:40,683 --> 00:47:42,183
It took me three years
of misery to realize

916
00:47:42,207 --> 00:47:43,749
that's not what I wanted
to do with my life.

917
00:47:43,773 --> 00:47:46,037
So I eventually moved back here

918
00:47:46,211 --> 00:47:47,611
and learned the
renovation business.

919
00:47:47,647 --> 00:47:49,344
- Mm.

920
00:47:49,518 --> 00:47:52,826
Now I understand what
Legacy Renovations means.

921
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:54,828
- Yeah, your Auntie
Lani did too.

922
00:47:55,002 --> 00:47:56,442
I gave her that
second chances speech

923
00:47:56,612 --> 00:47:57,633
and she hired me on the spot.

924
00:47:57,657 --> 00:48:00,529
- Ha ha...

925
00:48:00,703 --> 00:48:02,488
Well, I'm glad she did.

926
00:48:03,619 --> 00:48:04,751
- Me too.

927
00:48:04,925 --> 00:48:08,102
[guitar strumming]

928
00:48:11,671 --> 00:48:12,671
- Okay, my turn.

929
00:48:15,196 --> 00:48:16,521
Back in the house,
when you were getting

930
00:48:16,545 --> 00:48:17,590
your sledgehammer on,

931
00:48:17,764 --> 00:48:19,374
- Mmmhmm.

932
00:48:19,548 --> 00:48:20,699
- It sounded like
you had a few things

933
00:48:20,723 --> 00:48:25,206
you had to work out back in LA.

934
00:48:25,380 --> 00:48:27,252
- It does, doesn't it?

935
00:48:29,384 --> 00:48:31,430
- I hope being home helps
you find your answers.

936
00:48:33,649 --> 00:48:35,129
- Me too.

937
00:48:35,303 --> 00:48:37,523
[soft slow music]

938
00:48:42,397 --> 00:48:44,443
- So I was thinking we'll
want the hardwood floor

939
00:48:44,617 --> 00:48:46,073
in the living room to
flow into the wall tile

940
00:48:46,097 --> 00:48:47,417
of the kitchen,
what do you think?

941
00:48:47,576 --> 00:48:49,143
- I agree.

942
00:48:49,317 --> 00:48:50,860
And since we have the
gray quartz countertops

943
00:48:50,884 --> 00:48:51,493
I think we should use
this for the back-splash.

944
00:48:51,667 --> 00:48:53,234
Ombre.

945
00:48:53,408 --> 00:48:54,777
And then we can use
cabinets to finish it off

946
00:48:54,801 --> 00:48:56,020
to match the floor?

947
00:48:56,194 --> 00:48:57,760
- And stainless
steel appliances?

948
00:48:57,935 --> 00:48:58,587
- Sounds good.

949
00:48:58,761 --> 00:49:01,460
- I love it. Ha.

950
00:49:01,634 --> 00:49:03,568
You know, your sense of design
is quite impressive, ma'am.

951
00:49:03,592 --> 00:49:05,159
- Hm, well.

952
00:49:05,333 --> 00:49:07,253
I guess there's more to
you than just demos, sir.

953
00:49:07,335 --> 00:49:08,535
- Well, thank you.
- [chuckles]

954
00:49:10,817 --> 00:49:11,817
- So...

955
00:49:14,560 --> 00:49:16,431
I spilled my guts yesterday.

956
00:49:16,605 --> 00:49:17,955
Now it's your turn.

957
00:49:19,391 --> 00:49:20,522
- Okay.

958
00:49:20,696 --> 00:49:21,828
What do you wanna know?

959
00:49:22,002 --> 00:49:24,483
- After high school, then what?

960
00:49:27,051 --> 00:49:29,836
- Well, my dad tried to
keep me on the right path

961
00:49:30,010 --> 00:49:33,492
but I was a little lost.

962
00:49:33,666 --> 00:49:36,799
So I kind of knocked around
between a bunch of random jobs.

963
00:49:38,584 --> 00:49:39,889
It was actually my Auntie Lani

964
00:49:40,064 --> 00:49:42,196
who kicked me out of the nest.

965
00:49:42,370 --> 00:49:45,460
She told me, do what I loved

966
00:49:45,634 --> 00:49:47,767
and that the money would
take care of the itself.

967
00:49:49,508 --> 00:49:52,641
So I followed my Tinker
Toys, and my angles,

968
00:49:52,815 --> 00:49:54,556
and my math brain to college.

969
00:49:56,428 --> 00:49:58,014
- And that's when you
went from island girl

970
00:49:58,038 --> 00:50:00,432
to a big-time L.A. architect?

971
00:50:00,606 --> 00:50:02,260
- Oh, I wouldn't say big-time.

972
00:50:02,434 --> 00:50:04,175
I'm just a junior
partner at my firm.

973
00:50:04,349 --> 00:50:08,396
But occasionally in my dreams,
I'm Frank Lloyd Wright.

974
00:50:08,570 --> 00:50:09,570
- Ahhh..

975
00:50:12,748 --> 00:50:16,709
So what is it you love the
most about being an architect?

976
00:50:16,883 --> 00:50:18,450
- That's easy.

977
00:50:18,624 --> 00:50:21,670
It's that first
moment when a client

978
00:50:21,844 --> 00:50:23,281
walks into a completed project

979
00:50:23,455 --> 00:50:26,545
and you just know
that you nailed it.

980
00:50:28,155 --> 00:50:29,835
You fulfilled all of
their hopes and dreams

981
00:50:29,983 --> 00:50:34,248
and they usually wipe away
a few tears of happiness.

982
00:50:35,858 --> 00:50:38,557
Man, I live for those
tears of happiness.

983
00:50:40,646 --> 00:50:42,778
But I guess having
your happiness

984
00:50:42,952 --> 00:50:44,780
depend on other
people's happiness

985
00:50:44,954 --> 00:50:47,653
is a risky proposition, right?

986
00:50:48,871 --> 00:50:49,871
- Yeah, maybe.

987
00:50:51,222 --> 00:50:52,788
I mean, isn't that
what it's all about?

988
00:50:53,659 --> 00:50:54,834
- What is?

989
00:50:56,009 --> 00:50:57,489
- Love.

990
00:50:58,098 --> 00:51:00,361
- I wasn't talking about love.

991
00:51:00,535 --> 00:51:02,102
- Sure, you were.

992
00:51:02,276 --> 00:51:03,645
I asked you what you love
about being an architect

993
00:51:03,669 --> 00:51:06,933
and you told me.

994
00:51:07,107 --> 00:51:10,197
You know, I think in
life, work, in people,

995
00:51:12,504 --> 00:51:15,724
love should be the heart
of everything we're about.

996
00:51:18,118 --> 00:51:20,729
I know it can be risky,
but I don't know,

997
00:51:20,903 --> 00:51:21,948
I think it's worth it.

998
00:51:26,387 --> 00:51:28,955
- You know, I think you're
just a little bit deeper

999
00:51:29,129 --> 00:51:30,522
than you were in high school.

1000
00:51:32,001 --> 00:51:34,047
- Yeah, maybe I grew
up a little bit.

1001
00:51:37,006 --> 00:51:38,686
You know, I know what
I'm going to wish for

1002
00:51:38,791 --> 00:51:40,791
the first time I see this
place when it's finished.

1003
00:51:47,104 --> 00:51:48,322
- Hey, uh, guys?

1004
00:51:50,150 --> 00:51:51,804
Were you planning on
replacing the window

1005
00:51:51,978 --> 00:51:52,978
above the kitchen sink?

1006
00:51:54,154 --> 00:51:55,329
- Okay, thanks, Ethan.

1007
00:51:55,503 --> 00:51:56,703
I'll come in and check it out.

1008
00:51:57,723 --> 00:51:59,986
[hammering]

1009
00:52:02,989 --> 00:52:04,869
- Why're you taking down
that old crown molding?

1010
00:52:04,991 --> 00:52:05,992
It's still in good shape.

1011
00:52:06,166 --> 00:52:07,907
- Yes, it is.

1012
00:52:08,081 --> 00:52:10,103
And I would absolutely insist
that we just repaint it

1013
00:52:10,127 --> 00:52:12,694
if it weren't upside-down.

1014
00:52:12,868 --> 00:52:13,434
- Upside-down?

1015
00:52:13,608 --> 00:52:14,608
- Yeah.

1016
00:52:15,871 --> 00:52:20,267
This... is how it's
supposed to go.

1017
00:52:21,703 --> 00:52:22,703
- Wow.

1018
00:52:23,749 --> 00:52:24,749
- Be honest.

1019
00:52:25,533 --> 00:52:27,274
- Honest about what?

1020
00:52:27,448 --> 00:52:29,557
- Come on, I know you're a
big-time architect and all.

1021
00:52:29,581 --> 00:52:30,886
- Okay, here we go.

1022
00:52:31,060 --> 00:52:33,367
- But you're
impressed. I know it.

1023
00:52:33,541 --> 00:52:35,587
- Okay, yes, I'm impressed.
[laughs]

1024
00:52:37,632 --> 00:52:40,505
- And I saved us a whole
bunch of time and money

1025
00:52:40,679 --> 00:52:41,679
and I know you love that.

1026
00:52:41,810 --> 00:52:42,942
- Hmm.

1027
00:52:43,116 --> 00:52:44,116
I do love that. [laughs]

1028
00:52:48,817 --> 00:52:49,817
- Ow! Ow ow!

1029
00:52:49,949 --> 00:52:51,429
- Okay.

1030
00:52:51,603 --> 00:52:53,039
Okay.

1031
00:52:53,213 --> 00:52:54,234
- It really hurts, ooh, God.

1032
00:52:54,258 --> 00:52:55,433
- Alright, lemme see.

1033
00:52:55,607 --> 00:52:56,607
Lemme see, lemme see.

1034
00:52:58,697 --> 00:52:59,524
- Okay.

1035
00:52:59,698 --> 00:53:00,786
It doesn't look too bad.

1036
00:53:02,614 --> 00:53:04,355
- Ow ow.

1037
00:53:04,529 --> 00:53:05,312
- But you're probably gonna
lose that pretty thumbnail

1038
00:53:05,486 --> 00:53:06,052
of yours eventually.

1039
00:53:06,226 --> 00:53:07,314
- What?

1040
00:53:07,836 --> 00:53:09,316
[whimpering]

1041
00:53:13,973 --> 00:53:15,496
- Alright.

1042
00:53:15,670 --> 00:53:16,821
Gimme your hand, I'm
gonna put some ice on it.

1043
00:53:16,845 --> 00:53:17,672
- No, no, no, it's gonna burn.

1044
00:53:17,846 --> 00:53:19,326
- Come on now.

1045
00:53:21,850 --> 00:53:23,852
The ice will help keep
the swelling down.

1046
00:53:24,026 --> 00:53:25,811
- It still really hurts.

1047
00:53:31,817 --> 00:53:34,123
Did you just kiss my boo-boo?

1048
00:53:34,298 --> 00:53:35,821
- I kissed your boo-boo baggy.

1049
00:53:39,825 --> 00:53:41,043
Is it feeling any better?

1050
00:53:41,218 --> 00:53:42,436
- I don't know.

1051
00:53:43,959 --> 00:53:44,959
Yes?

1052
00:53:48,268 --> 00:53:50,096
We should get back to work.

1053
00:53:50,270 --> 00:53:52,141
- Not with that thumbsicle.

1054
00:53:52,316 --> 00:53:54,492
I say we knock off early today.

1055
00:53:54,666 --> 00:53:56,189
Give yourself a chance to heal.

1056
00:53:56,363 --> 00:53:58,322
Besides, there's something
I wanna show you.

1057
00:53:59,714 --> 00:54:01,150
- We can't lose a day.

1058
00:54:01,325 --> 00:54:03,457
- It won't be a total
loss. I promise.

1059
00:54:06,678 --> 00:54:08,723
[uplifting music]

1060
00:54:08,897 --> 00:54:11,117
[laughing]

1061
00:54:17,123 --> 00:54:18,255
- Wow.

1062
00:54:21,127 --> 00:54:22,167
- Happy homecoming, Gemma.

1063
00:54:23,912 --> 00:54:26,219
- You did all this?

1064
00:54:26,393 --> 00:54:28,395
- It's actually what I
had Ethan doing all day.

1065
00:54:32,094 --> 00:54:33,400
- I don't even know what to say.

1066
00:54:35,359 --> 00:54:38,231
- Could you really feel at home
without a proper homecoming?

1067

01:03:53,264 --> 01:03:55,570
- Okay, just think about
the opportunity here.

1242
01:03:55,744 --> 01:03:56,744
- What's in it for you?

1243
01:03:59,923 --> 01:04:01,683
- This property would be
a financial game-changer

1244
01:04:01,707 --> 01:04:03,578
for me, too.

1245
01:04:04,449 --> 01:04:05,711
For both of us.

1246
01:04:07,234 --> 01:04:09,410
- You have always
been about the deal.

1247
01:04:11,717 --> 01:04:13,937
- No, not, not since
you broke up with me.

1248
01:04:15,764 --> 01:04:17,679
I've been trying to see
things more like you do.

1249
01:04:19,594 --> 01:04:21,683
- Oh, well, I
thought I was just...

1250
01:04:21,858 --> 01:04:23,511
sunny and naive?

1251
01:04:25,339 --> 01:04:27,254
- That was a really
stupid thing to say.

1252
01:04:29,561 --> 01:04:31,650
I'm really sorry about that.

1253
01:04:34,305 --> 01:04:35,665
- I gotta get back
in there, but...

1254
01:04:35,741 --> 01:04:38,004
I will think about it.

1255
01:04:38,178 --> 01:04:41,747
- Great. I'll be on the
island for a few more days.

1256
01:04:41,921 --> 01:04:43,420
I've already got the
paperwork drawn up

1257
01:04:43,444 --> 01:04:45,359
if you want to move
forward with this.

1258
01:04:45,533 --> 01:04:46,795
This could happen fast.

1259
01:04:46,970 --> 01:04:48,232
You could start revising your

1260
01:04:48,406 --> 01:04:50,060
Twin Pines footprint
immediately,

1261
01:04:50,234 --> 01:04:53,106
and Barrington will be on
the first flight here...

1262
01:04:53,280 --> 01:04:54,499
the moment you say yes.

1263
01:04:55,717 --> 01:05:03,717
[lighthearted ukulele music]

1264
01:05:05,771 --> 01:05:13,771
[lighthearted ukulele music]

1265
01:05:15,824 --> 01:05:23,824
[lighthearted ukulele music]

1266
01:05:28,750 --> 01:05:30,274
- Everything okay?

1267
01:05:31,753 --> 01:05:34,234
- Can we just call it a day?

1268
01:05:34,408 --> 01:05:36,280
- It's not like you
to shut down early.

1269
01:05:36,454 --> 01:05:39,239
Schedule... and all.

1270
01:05:39,413 --> 01:05:40,853
- I need to talk to
Sarah and my dad.

1271
01:05:42,634 --> 01:05:44,244
- What did he say?

1272
01:05:46,420 --> 01:05:50,250
- Darren has an
investment group that...

1273
01:05:50,424 --> 01:05:52,818
wants the whole property
for a condo development.

1274
01:05:52,992 --> 01:05:54,733
- What about
finishing the house?

1275
01:05:56,039 --> 01:05:58,519
- There would be no point if we
go with the development deal.

1276
01:05:58,693 --> 01:06:01,653
We'd just have to demo
it all to the ground.

1277
01:06:01,827 --> 01:06:04,482
- And you would
be okay with that?

1278
01:06:06,397 --> 01:06:08,442
- Financially...

1279
01:06:09,400 --> 01:06:11,271
it would mean a whole
new life for my family.

1280
01:06:11,445 --> 01:06:14,622
And, and my feelings
don't really matter when

1281
01:06:14,796 --> 01:06:16,450
it's what's best for the family.

1282
01:06:16,624 --> 01:06:18,278
- What about Auntie Lani?

1283
01:06:18,452 --> 01:06:20,193
And what she hoped for
for the renovation?

1284
01:06:23,414 --> 01:06:25,285
- Ben, she left me this
property to figure out

1285
01:06:25,459 --> 01:06:26,112
what to do with it.

1286
01:06:26,286 --> 01:06:27,853
And, and...

1287
01:06:30,073 --> 01:06:31,273
that is what I'm trying to do.

1288
01:06:32,858 --> 01:06:34,338
- Just let me keep working.

1289
01:06:36,035 --> 01:06:39,386
- It would be a waste, Ben.

1290
01:06:40,083 --> 01:06:41,582
If we're just going
to tear it all down,

1291
01:06:41,606 --> 01:06:43,434
there would be no point.

1292
01:06:46,785 --> 01:06:48,308
- I'm sorry, Gemma.

1293
01:06:48,482 --> 01:06:50,876
I'm just not ready to say
goodbye to this house.

1294
01:06:56,925 --> 01:06:59,189
- I can't do this right now.

1295
01:07:00,929 --> 01:07:04,759
Just... can you just
pack up your tools?

1296
01:07:04,933 --> 01:07:07,806
Uh, I need to go
talk to my family.

1297
01:07:16,075 --> 01:07:19,339
- Okay, so, it's settled then?

1298
01:07:21,341 --> 01:07:23,213
- I think it's kind of amazing.
[sighs]

1299
01:07:24,649 --> 01:07:26,564
Grandma's Coffee House...

1300
01:07:26,738 --> 01:07:27,826
Here I come.

1301
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:29,610
- So you're telling me that

1302
01:07:29,784 --> 01:07:31,632
if I pick up my grades the
last two years of high school,

1303
01:07:31,656 --> 01:07:33,179
and wanted to go to the mainland

1304
01:07:33,353 --> 01:07:36,487
to the private college
of my choice, I could?

1305
01:07:36,661 --> 01:07:38,315
- You could.

1306
01:07:38,489 --> 01:07:41,274
So... it's settled then?

1307
01:07:45,800 --> 01:07:48,194
Dad? You've been kind of quiet.

1308
01:07:50,544 --> 01:07:52,305
- I have a couple things
I have to do back at home,

1309
01:07:52,329 --> 01:07:54,287
so I'll catch up with
you all later, okay?

1310
01:07:57,508 --> 01:07:59,858
[slow soft music]

1311
01:08:10,521 --> 01:08:11,521
- Dad?

1312
01:08:14,177 --> 01:08:15,656
Dad, I need you to talk to me.

1313
01:08:19,095 --> 01:08:20,879
Hey!

1314
01:08:22,141 --> 01:08:23,751
I miss her too.

1315
01:08:23,925 --> 01:08:26,232
[slow soft music]

1316
01:08:33,196 --> 01:08:35,676
- This table was supposed
to be in her room

1317
01:08:35,850 --> 01:08:37,722
at the retirement home,

1318
01:08:38,766 --> 01:08:42,248
so we had a little piece
of her home for her there.

1319
01:08:44,250 --> 01:08:46,252
I started this table
four or five years ago,

1320
01:08:46,426 --> 01:08:49,951
and there was other priorities,
there was other jobs.

1321
01:08:53,085 --> 01:08:54,478
I couldn't finish it...

1322
01:08:55,783 --> 01:08:57,698
before she died.

1323
01:08:57,872 --> 01:09:00,745
- Dad, that is not your fault.

1324
01:09:00,919 --> 01:09:04,749
Stuff happens, and Auntie
Lani would have understood.

1325
01:09:04,923 --> 01:09:06,794
- Yes, I know.

1326
01:09:07,839 --> 01:09:10,363
But I am going to
finish this table.

1327
01:09:11,756 --> 01:09:13,801
Because we need a
piece of her legacy...

1328
01:09:15,281 --> 01:09:16,935
before we bulldoze
down that house.

1329
01:09:20,199 --> 01:09:22,984
- Yeah... we do.

1330
01:09:24,638 --> 01:09:26,858
- [sniffles] And you know,
just to let you know,

1331
01:09:27,032 --> 01:09:28,686
I don't need the
world surfing tour.

1332
01:09:28,860 --> 01:09:31,384
I'm very happy the
way I live right here,

1333
01:09:31,558 --> 01:09:33,299
just like this.

1334
01:09:34,866 --> 01:09:40,698
And you and your sister...

1335
01:09:40,872 --> 01:09:44,005
are my aloha.

1336
01:09:44,180 --> 01:09:47,400
And will always be.

1337
01:09:49,141 --> 01:09:53,624
[soft slow music]

1338
01:09:54,581 --> 01:09:56,844
- I really hope that
the condo project is...

1339
01:09:58,063 --> 01:09:59,063
the right choice.

1340
01:10:02,633 --> 01:10:05,810
- You have your auntie
with you always.

1341
01:10:06,114 --> 01:10:09,553
You have your momma
with you always.

1342
01:10:11,250 --> 01:10:14,035
And they were a lot
smarter than me.

1343
01:10:14,210 --> 01:10:16,821
And so are you.

1344
01:10:21,826 --> 01:10:26,352
- A'a I ka hula, waiho
I ka maka'u I ka hale.

1345
01:10:28,963 --> 01:10:30,748
- And I agree.

1346
01:10:31,836 --> 01:10:33,838
Mahalo ke akua.

1347
01:10:34,665 --> 01:10:42,665
[soft slow music]

1348
01:10:44,675 --> 01:10:52,675
[soft slow music]

1349
01:10:57,035 --> 01:10:58,863
[knocking]

1350
01:10:59,037 --> 01:11:00,821
- Come in.

1351
01:11:02,562 --> 01:11:04,762
- So, the spinning pinwheel
of death means that you need

1352
01:11:04,825 --> 01:11:07,437
to clean out your laptop
more than once every decade.

1353
01:11:07,611 --> 01:11:10,178
Your hard drive was full
of digital garbage that

1354
01:11:10,353 --> 01:11:11,919
was just slowing
everything down.

1355
01:11:12,093 --> 01:11:13,897
That's the reason why your
email was being balky.

1356
01:11:13,921 --> 01:11:15,053
- So it's fixed?

1357
01:11:15,227 --> 01:11:16,227
- It's fixed.

1358
01:11:16,315 --> 01:11:17,315
- And I wasn't ghosted?

1359
01:11:17,360 --> 01:11:18,839
- You weren't ghosted.

1360
01:11:19,013 --> 01:11:20,573
Well, you better hurry
up and get ready.

1361
01:11:20,667 --> 01:11:22,123
We do not want to be
late for the signing.

1362
01:11:22,147 --> 01:11:24,018
- Okay.

1363
01:11:42,689 --> 01:11:44,517
- Gemma...

1364
01:11:46,389 --> 01:11:48,069
There was something I
wanted to say earlier

1365
01:11:48,129 --> 01:11:49,914
when we were on Skype.

1366
01:11:50,088 --> 01:11:53,178
And I held back because I
don't ever want you to think

1367
01:11:53,352 --> 01:11:54,614
I'm interfering with your life.

1368
01:11:56,137 --> 01:11:58,923
But after we hung
up I kicked myself.

1369
01:12:00,054 --> 01:12:01,752
Of course, I want to interfere,

1370
01:12:01,926 --> 01:12:04,145
because you're my little peanut.

1371
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:06,974
So, here goes...

1372
01:12:07,148 --> 01:12:09,455
When it comes to love,

1373
01:12:09,629 --> 01:12:12,502
don't ever settle for
less than you deserve.

1374
01:12:12,676 --> 01:12:15,505
True love is more than
a practical choice.

1375
01:12:17,376 --> 01:12:21,467
I pray God brings you a man
who will love and cherish you,

1376
01:12:21,641 --> 01:12:25,906
not for what you can give
him, but for who you are.

1377
01:12:26,080 --> 01:12:27,430
Yeah, I know I'm biased,

1378
01:12:27,604 --> 01:12:30,258
but you are a very
special young lady

1379
01:12:30,433 --> 01:12:32,565
who is going to change
the world with your gifts.

1380
01:12:34,350 --> 01:12:36,197
And you deserve someone
who will see that in you,

1381
01:12:36,221 --> 01:12:38,179
like I do.

1382
01:12:38,354 --> 01:12:40,051
Oh no, I gotta go.

1383
01:12:40,225 --> 01:12:41,792
I'm late to meet
your daddy for lunch.

1384
01:12:43,010 --> 01:12:44,010
A hui hou.

1385
01:12:45,099 --> 01:12:46,100
I love you, Peanut.

1386
01:12:48,059 --> 01:12:50,191
[soft music]

1387
01:12:55,806 --> 01:12:57,808
- I love you, too, Auntie Lani.

1388
01:12:57,982 --> 01:13:00,811
[crying]

1389
01:13:00,985 --> 01:13:07,818

[upbeat music]

1392
01:13:35,019 --> 01:13:38,892
- I thought you said you
stopped working on the house?

1393
01:13:39,066 --> 01:13:40,938
- We did.

1394
01:13:44,724 --> 01:13:47,771
- I don't think Auntie
Lani got the memo.

1395
01:13:49,250 --> 01:13:51,165
- Neither did Ben.

1396
01:13:52,297 --> 01:13:54,734
- Oh my gosh.

1397
01:13:54,908 --> 01:13:57,215
[upbeat music]

1398
01:14:12,404 --> 01:14:13,404
- I...

1399
01:14:14,972 --> 01:14:17,583
I don't understand why
Ben finished the exterior.

1400
01:14:19,193 --> 01:14:21,195
- I learned long ago
never question a miracle.

1401
01:14:22,458 --> 01:14:24,677
- Aloha, familia!
[chuckles]

1402
01:14:26,200 --> 01:14:28,072
Mr. Burke!

1403
01:14:28,246 --> 01:14:30,030
Hey! Whoo-hoo.

1404
01:14:33,294 --> 01:14:34,426
Good to see you again.

1405
01:14:36,559 --> 01:14:39,953
- Mr. Barrington, this is my
dad, Pono, my sister, Sarah,

1406
01:14:40,127 --> 01:14:42,782
my niece, Emma, and my
brother-in-law, Mike.

1407
01:14:42,956 --> 01:14:43,956
- Nice to see you all.

1408
01:14:45,089 --> 01:14:46,743
This is the most
beautiful property

1409
01:14:46,917 --> 01:14:48,309
I could ever hope to develop.

1410
01:14:50,094 --> 01:14:51,443
And I'm glad to see there's

1411
01:14:51,617 --> 01:14:53,116
no hard feelings between
us about Twin Pines.

1412
01:14:53,140 --> 01:14:54,185
- No, sir.

1413
01:14:54,359 --> 01:14:56,013
- Gemma would never burn bridges

1414
01:14:56,187 --> 01:14:57,362
with a business relationship.

1415
01:14:59,582 --> 01:15:01,975
- Well, shall we get started?

1416
01:15:02,149 --> 01:15:03,229
- Who should we start with?

1417
01:15:03,281 --> 01:15:04,761
Start with Sarah?

1418
01:15:04,935 --> 01:15:06,850
All right! Uh, do you mind...?

1419
01:15:07,981 --> 01:15:09,156
Thank you.

1420
01:15:09,330 --> 01:15:11,158
There we go.

1421
01:15:15,249 --> 01:15:17,569
- Auntie Lani would have loved
what you did with the house.

1422
01:15:19,515 --> 01:15:21,299
- Here...

1423
01:15:21,908 --> 01:15:22,908
and here...

1424
01:15:23,519 --> 01:15:25,956
and hello bakery.

1425
01:15:27,958 --> 01:15:29,699
Perfect.

1426
01:15:30,395 --> 01:15:31,657
And actually...

1427
01:15:36,619 --> 01:15:39,186
I have my own special pen
for Gemma to sign with.

1428
01:15:49,022 --> 01:15:50,546
- Wow.

1429
01:15:51,503 --> 01:15:52,503
Wow, um...

1430
01:15:53,940 --> 01:15:54,940
what is this?

1431
01:15:55,028 --> 01:15:56,769
Darren?

1432
01:15:58,162 --> 01:16:03,863
- It's my amends... to you.

1433
01:16:04,037 --> 01:16:05,604
I'm sorry for blindsiding you,

1434
01:16:05,778 --> 01:16:08,172
but just, I didn't want
to ruin the surprise.

1435
01:16:09,434 --> 01:16:11,349
- You are unbelievable.

1436
01:16:11,523 --> 01:16:13,481
- What's going on here?

1437
01:16:13,656 --> 01:16:15,788
- Please, indulge me for
a moment, Mr. Barrington.

1438
01:16:17,311 --> 01:16:18,835
- You're proposing
to the sunny girl?

1439
01:16:19,009 --> 01:16:21,011
Oh, lovely.

1440
01:16:21,185 --> 01:16:23,013
- What did you just call me?

1441
01:16:23,187 --> 01:16:27,321
- Gemma, sweetheart, I thought
this would be a romantic way

1442
01:16:27,495 --> 01:16:29,019
to start our new partnership.

1443
01:16:30,324 --> 01:16:32,239
To restart...

1444
01:16:32,413 --> 01:16:34,154
our life together.

1445
01:16:34,328 --> 01:16:38,158
- Darren, we don't have
a life together anymore.

1446
01:16:46,166 --> 01:16:48,734
- But we could.

1447
01:16:48,908 --> 01:16:51,345
We could be partners
in every single way.

1448
01:16:58,439 --> 01:17:01,399
[upbeat ukulele music]

1449
01:17:01,573 --> 01:17:05,403
- No... we can't.

1450
01:17:07,013 --> 01:17:08,711
[laughs]

1451
01:17:10,060 --> 01:17:11,714
- Why not?

1452
01:17:11,888 --> 01:17:14,760
- It wasn't until just now
that I realized that...

1453
01:17:16,632 --> 01:17:19,417
I already have a partner.

1454
01:17:22,376 --> 01:17:25,466
Mr. Barrington, my apologies
for Darren bringing you

1455
01:17:25,641 --> 01:17:27,033
all this way for nothing.

1456
01:17:27,207 --> 01:17:28,207
And...

1457
01:17:28,295 --> 01:17:30,907
Sarah, I promise that

1458
01:17:31,081 --> 01:17:33,431
I will help you find a
way to get your dream.

1459
01:17:36,129 --> 01:17:37,174
[sighs]

1460
01:17:38,305 --> 01:17:40,220
The deal is off.

1461
01:17:42,396 --> 01:17:44,964
I am not selling the property.

1462
01:17:47,314 --> 01:17:49,882
- Gemma... please.

1463
01:17:50,056 --> 01:17:51,492
- I could sue you for this.

1464
01:17:51,667 --> 01:17:53,625
- Yes, you could.

1465
01:17:53,799 --> 01:17:58,369
But I suggest that you just
stay for a couple of days.

1466
01:17:58,543 --> 01:18:01,764
Sit on the beach, let
the waves lap your toes.

1467
01:18:01,938 --> 01:18:03,591
Do a little snorkeling
and let the ocean,

1468
01:18:03,766 --> 01:18:07,160
just wash all of that
pompous off of you.

1469
01:18:07,334 --> 01:18:08,964
And then you can head
back to the mainland,

1470
01:18:08,988 --> 01:18:11,904
and be a sunnier, more
naive human being.

1471
01:18:12,078 --> 01:18:13,863
- I will have your
firm shut down so fast

1472
01:18:14,037 --> 01:18:15,757
that you don't even-
[hand slap on shoulder]

1473
01:18:15,908 --> 01:18:18,028
- Tell you what, Brotha, why
don't you follow me home?

1474
01:18:19,564 --> 01:18:21,063
I'll teach you how to
crack open a coconut.

1475
01:18:21,087 --> 01:18:22,847
Maybe you can sip on
that for a little while.

1476
01:18:26,702 --> 01:18:27,311
- Uh...

1477
01:18:27,485 --> 01:18:29,313
- Beat it.

1478
01:18:31,184 --> 01:18:32,184
- Darren.

1479
01:18:33,230 --> 01:18:37,451
[light upbeat music]

1480
01:18:38,365 --> 01:18:39,889
- Mr. Barrington! I...

1481
01:18:42,326 --> 01:18:43,893
- What now, sis?

1482
01:18:44,545 --> 01:18:47,548
- I go find my partner.

1483
01:18:47,723 --> 01:18:53,076
[light upbeat music]

1484
01:18:53,250 --> 01:18:55,252
- Yee-hoo!
[laughter]

1485
01:18:56,601 --> 01:19:04,601
[happy guitar music]

1486
01:19:06,611 --> 01:19:13,139
[happy guitar music]

1487
01:19:13,313 --> 01:19:14,880
- Wow!

1488
01:19:20,190 --> 01:19:21,757
I don't know if you saw,

1489
01:19:21,931 --> 01:19:24,629
but I just sent Darren
and Barrington packing.

1490
01:19:24,803 --> 01:19:26,544
- Yeah, I didn't
want to eavesdrop,

1491
01:19:26,718 --> 01:19:30,853
but I, uh, I watched the whole
thing through the window.

1492
01:19:31,636 --> 01:19:34,204
[happy guitar music]

1493
01:19:39,513 --> 01:19:41,777
[upbeat music]

1494
01:19:49,219 --> 01:19:50,219
- That's it, right there.

1495
01:19:51,525 --> 01:19:53,614
That's the look I wanted
to see on your face.

1496
01:19:57,662 --> 01:20:00,447
You know you told me you
live for the first impression

1497
01:20:00,621 --> 01:20:01,927
a job makes on a client.

1498
01:20:03,755 --> 01:20:06,540
Well, that was my wish, too.

1499
01:20:07,890 --> 01:20:09,892
First time you walked in here.

1500
01:20:10,806 --> 01:20:13,721
- It is so beautiful.

1501
01:20:13,896 --> 01:20:17,073
I mean, it's more beautiful
than I ever could have imagined.

1502
01:20:17,247 --> 01:20:18,552
Outside and in.

1503
01:20:18,726 --> 01:20:20,293
- I had to finish the house,

1504
01:20:20,467 --> 01:20:22,818
even if the bulldozers
were coming.

1505
01:20:25,255 --> 01:20:27,387
- I don't know how
you got all this done.

1506
01:20:27,561 --> 01:20:29,085
I mean, forty-eight hours ago,

1507
01:20:29,259 --> 01:20:31,261
you were packing up your tools.

1508
01:20:31,435 --> 01:20:32,515
- Yeah, I recruited a team.

1509
01:20:34,090 --> 01:20:36,570
My buddies at Subato Studios
stepped up with the furniture,

1510
01:20:36,744 --> 01:20:39,225
and I had Ethan call all
his millennial buddies.

1511
01:20:39,399 --> 01:20:41,749
[laughs]

1512
01:20:41,924 --> 01:20:43,229
I wanted you to
see it like this.

1513
01:20:44,709 --> 01:20:45,989
Like a woman in
a beautiful gown.

1514
01:20:50,758 --> 01:20:53,936
- The whale window
never looked so good.

1515
01:20:54,110 --> 01:20:56,721
I never thought about this
with Auntie Lani's house,

1516
01:20:56,895 --> 01:20:58,984
until today, when I walked in.

1517
01:21:00,768 --> 01:21:02,659
You turned this into a
home that I can see myself

1518
01:21:02,683 --> 01:21:04,729
living in someday.

1519
01:21:04,903 --> 01:21:06,862
- We turned this
into a home. And...

1520
01:21:08,298 --> 01:21:09,865
I agree.

1521
01:21:10,604 --> 01:21:13,085
Even if I do have to have the
furniture back in a few days.

1522
01:21:13,259 --> 01:21:14,259
- It's all rented?

1523
01:21:14,347 --> 01:21:16,132
- Yeah.

1524
01:21:16,306 --> 01:21:18,090
All but one piece.

1525
01:21:22,486 --> 01:21:24,227
- Aloha kakahiaka.

1526
01:21:24,401 --> 01:21:25,445
- Oh, my gosh.

1527
01:21:25,619 --> 01:21:27,578
- Ah-ha-ha...

1528
01:21:27,752 --> 01:21:30,320
Dad, you finished it.

1529
01:21:30,494 --> 01:21:31,495
- I did. [sighs]

1530
01:21:32,713 --> 01:21:33,714
- It's beautiful.

1531
01:21:33,889 --> 01:21:35,803
- It is.

1532
01:21:35,978 --> 01:21:39,895
- So you were in on this
whole conspiracy too?

1533
01:21:40,069 --> 01:21:42,462
- He was one of the
favors I called in.

1534
01:21:43,724 --> 01:21:46,292
- So, Peanut, where
would you like it?

1535
01:21:47,903 --> 01:21:49,817
- Over there, Dad.

1536
01:21:49,992 --> 01:21:51,665
It's a good place to
watch the whales from.

1537
01:21:51,689 --> 01:21:54,039
- All right.

1538
01:22:02,352 --> 01:22:03,352
- Perfect.

1539
01:22:03,483 --> 01:22:05,094
- Yeah.

1540
01:22:05,529 --> 01:22:06,617
- I love you.

1541
01:22:06,791 --> 01:22:08,706
- I love you too, Daddy.

1542
01:22:11,361 --> 01:22:12,492
- And I love you too, buddy.

1543
01:22:14,581 --> 01:22:15,234
- Love you, Pono.

1544
01:22:15,408 --> 01:22:17,149
- All right!

1545
01:22:22,372 --> 01:22:24,722
- So, what changed
your mind out there?

1546
01:22:26,854 --> 01:22:28,595
- It was something
my Auntie Lani said.

1547
01:22:28,769 --> 01:22:33,470
About... being with people
who love you for who you are.

1548
01:22:34,993 --> 01:22:38,040
Not for what you
can do for them.

1549
01:22:40,607 --> 01:22:42,218
You know, my whole life,

1550
01:22:42,392 --> 01:22:45,612
I feel like I've been
trying to be that person...

1551
01:22:45,786 --> 01:22:47,701
someone that I'm not.

1552
01:22:47,875 --> 01:22:49,965
Trying to earn their
love instead of just...

1553
01:22:51,662 --> 01:22:54,404
opening my arms to the
people who already love me.

1554
01:22:55,492 --> 01:22:56,536
- So...

1555
01:22:56,710 --> 01:22:57,929
who already loves you?

1556
01:22:58,974 --> 01:23:00,540
- Well...

1557
01:23:00,714 --> 01:23:02,412
my Auntie Lani was one.

1558
01:23:02,586 --> 01:23:03,674
And my dad.

1559
01:23:03,848 --> 01:23:04,848
And Sarah.

1560
01:23:06,633 --> 01:23:08,984
My family cares for me that way.

1561
01:23:11,682 --> 01:23:14,076
- Anybody else?

1562
01:23:16,513 --> 01:23:18,602
- Ben...

1563
01:23:18,950 --> 01:23:21,909
I am so sorry that
I gave up on you.

1564
01:23:22,084 --> 01:23:25,522
You've never given up
on this house or on me.

1565
01:23:27,698 --> 01:23:32,659
- I never will.

1566
01:23:33,704 --> 01:23:35,967
[bright guitar music]

1567
01:23:42,800 --> 01:23:44,802
[birds singing]

1568
01:23:48,284 --> 01:23:50,373
- It worked really well...
[laughs] Mmm-hm.

1569
01:23:51,939 --> 01:23:54,594
- Hope you guys are hungry!

1570
01:23:54,768 --> 01:23:56,422
- Uh, Dad is on the prowl,

1571
01:23:56,596 --> 01:23:58,642
so you better get those
crab cakes out here quick.

1572
01:24:00,644 --> 01:24:02,298
Ah, it smells amazing!

1573
01:24:02,472 --> 01:24:03,560
- Crab cake?

1574
01:24:03,734 --> 01:24:04,778
- Thank you!

1575
01:24:04,952 --> 01:24:06,060
- Emma made the raspberry tarts.

1576
01:24:06,084 --> 01:24:07,390
- I can't wait to try one.

1577
01:24:11,959 --> 01:24:13,526
- She's got a knack for cooking.

1578
01:24:13,700 --> 01:24:15,833
[giggles]

1579
01:24:17,443 --> 01:24:18,531
- Mmmm. Oh...

1580
01:24:18,705 --> 01:24:19,705
my...

1581
01:24:19,837 --> 01:24:20,838
- Goodness!

1582
01:24:23,841 --> 01:24:25,756
- Oh!

1583
01:24:25,930 --> 01:24:28,802
You know what, I drove passed
Grandma's Coffee House today,

1584
01:24:28,976 --> 01:24:31,240
and the for sale sign was down.

1585
01:24:32,719 --> 01:24:33,719
- Really?

1586
01:24:37,985 --> 01:24:42,338
Oh. Well, I hope somebody
makes good use of the property.

1587
01:24:42,512 --> 01:24:43,600
- Me, too.

1588
01:24:43,774 --> 01:24:45,602
- Yeah. Me, too!

1589
01:24:45,776 --> 01:24:47,473
- Wait, what?

1590
01:24:47,647 --> 01:24:49,519
[laughs]
