00:00:38,335 --> 00:00:42,688
I wake up middle of the
night drenched in sweat.

4
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:44,618
My heart is racing, okay.

5
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:47,798
I reach a hand over to
Lindsey's side of the bed.

6
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:51,098
She's not there and I realize
it's not even our bed.

7
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:54,118
It's just a sad mattress on a box spring.

8
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:56,018
So I make my way into the hallway.

9
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:57,224
I go into Cooper's room,

10
00:00:57,226 --> 00:00:58,424
that's our son,

11
00:00:58,426 --> 00:00:59,688
and he's not there either.

12
00:00:59,690 --> 00:01:00,698
And so now I'm really nervous.

13
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:02,748
I got running into Skyler's
room, the baby's room,

14
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:04,063
and she's not in her crib,

15
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:07,808
and I realize I'm not even in my house.

16
00:01:07,810 --> 00:01:11,103
I'm at some shitty, one
bedroom walkup in uptown,

17
00:01:12,550 --> 00:01:17,398
and I turn around and
suddenly this window appears,

18
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:20,143
and I just chuck myself
right the fuck out it.

19
00:01:21,847 --> 00:01:23,198

22

there was something wrong.

743

It usually doesn't get that far.

744

When you were a baby and
you screamed and screamed,

745
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:03,938
and there was nothing I
could do to get you to stop,

746
00:41:03,940 --> 00:41:06,768
I'd imagine taking you by the ankles,

747
00:41:06,770 --> 00:41:09,820
and swinging your little head

748
00:41:09,822 --> 00:41:12,368
into the head into the wall over and over

749
00:41:12,370 --> 00:41:14,728
until it was a bloody pulp.

750

Oh, my God.

751
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:18,021
But then I'd feel so
guilty from imagining it,

752
00:41:18,023 --> 00:41:19,768

Yes, with climate change
and school shootings,

a world that's inhospitable.

761

always been inhospitable.

to never exist at all,

life you're having now,

778

Last week, I got an Uber.

The driver must've seen
me hand Wally to Maya,

happy to be getting off work

I found some clothes
with fresh blood on them,

1437
01:22:35,180 --> 01:22:37,758
and I thought for just a split second

1438
01:22:37,760 --> 01:22:40,208
that Maya had tried to
maybe hurt herself or...
