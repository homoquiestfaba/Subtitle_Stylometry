1
00:00:28,602 --> 00:00:36,410
Four troops were murdered with
on explosive in a car... 

2
00:00:51,778 --> 00:00:58,484
 ... more than 3 thousand units of the I exercise
North American has died from the 2003.

3
00:01:19,516 --> 00:01:21,858
I increase of the attacks

4
00:01:53,929 --> 00:01:58,025
LIONS FOR LAMBS

5
00:02:12,584 --> 00:02:14,960
Office of the Senator Jasper Irving

6
00:02:18,184 --> 00:02:18,927
Senator.

7
00:02:20,008 --> 00:02:20,784
As you he/she wants.

8
00:02:22,058 --> 00:02:23,223
He is in the Cabinet.

9
00:02:25,022 --> 00:02:26,084
Do excuse?

10
00:02:26,388 --> 00:02:27,454
- The senator.
- Oh.

11
00:02:36,024 --> 00:02:36,902
Hello. Good morning, Janine.

12
00:02:38,664 --> 00:02:39,828
Alone they would be bad if there was not anything... 

13
00:02:40,225 --> 00:02:41,191
 ... new.

14
00:02:42,212 --> 00:02:43,374
Sit down, please.

15
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,104
Do you want coffee, does it dilute, tea?

16
00:02:45,499 --> 00:02:46,566
No, thank you.

17
00:02:46,705 --> 00:02:48,036
- It is very good to see you.
- Thank you.

18
00:02:48,169 --> 00:02:48,852
Apologize.

19
00:02:49,601 --> 00:02:51,256
- Senator?
- Orchid, you bring me a coffee, please.

20
00:02:52,435 --> 00:02:55,453
I read the history that you wrote in
Rise. You investigated in the politics.

21
00:02:55,592 --> 00:02:56,435
Did you make it?

22
00:02:57,123 --> 00:02:58,875
In fact I believe that it is a good history.

23
00:02:59,759 --> 00:03:00,469
It is a different angle.

24
00:03:02,396 --> 00:03:03,171
Thank you.

25
00:03:06,271 --> 00:03:08,193
We are waiting for you
personal of public relationships?

26
00:03:08,323 --> 00:03:09,554
No. Alone we will be you and me.

27
00:03:10,047 --> 00:03:11,901
Not I want them to interrupt
the captious questions.

28
00:03:12,033 --> 00:03:13,200
Oh. that luck.

29
00:03:14,637 --> 00:03:16,191
You were the first that me
he/she helped with my candidacy... 

30
00:03:16,428 --> 00:03:17,661
 ... and now I return you the favor.

31
00:03:18,056 --> 00:03:20,232
Not it was a favor. It was
alone as I saw you years ago.

32
00:03:20,791 --> 00:03:22,157
In all ways I am been appreciated.

33
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:25,407
I am considering to stay in your team.
Not he/she knew that pressed that the count was.

34
00:03:27,433 --> 00:03:28,885
I won for 77% of the votes.

35
00:03:29,092 --> 00:03:29,962
Oh yes.

36
00:03:30,851 --> 00:03:31,562
I have not forgotten it.

37
00:03:34,498 --> 00:03:36,119
You are aware that I am
making this line of time... ?

38
00:03:36,353 --> 00:03:39,439
If. You are making the line of time
more detailed of the world of the terror... 

39
00:03:39,642 --> 00:03:41,722
 ... and I bet to that if it is
as another of those lines... 

40
00:03:41,767 --> 00:03:43,836
 ... of time that you/they have come out
from last year... 

41
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:45,300
 ... you will hoist the candles
to open up I happen... 

42
00:03:45,437 --> 00:03:47,550
 ... in this complicated world.

43
00:03:47,652 --> 00:03:49,305
I believe that you are exaggerating a little.

44
00:03:49,702 --> 00:03:51,453
You will be you who he/she makes the decisions.

45
00:03:52,079 --> 00:03:53,539
- Don't you trust us?
- I trust you.

46
00:03:54,682 --> 00:03:55,654
And for that reason it is that you are here.

47
00:03:56,636 --> 00:03:58,130
To discuss what, exactly?

48
00:03:58,329 --> 00:04:01,219
To see if you want to write
a honest history again.

49
00:04:02,496 --> 00:04:05,785
To remember the little attention that
he/she has been lent to the war... 

50
00:04:06,046 --> 00:04:06,822
 ... during six years.

51
00:04:07,347 --> 00:04:08,869
You can make money with this.

52
00:04:12,004 --> 00:04:12,875
Which is the history?

53
00:04:13,209 --> 00:04:14,345
It is about a new plan... 

54
00:04:14,674 --> 00:04:16,909
 ... that you is
developing in Afghanistan.

55
00:04:17,765 --> 00:04:19,615
Afghanistan? A new plan?

56
00:04:19,752 --> 00:04:21,205
A new plan that
it will win the war so much,

57
00:04:21,801 --> 00:04:23,551
and as tawdry as this it can sound,

58
00:04:24,016 --> 00:04:25,477
the heart and people's mind.

59
00:04:28,119 --> 00:04:29,091
Which is the plan?

60
00:04:29,095 --> 00:04:31,043
Obviously, I will find it
impossible to be everything.

61
00:04:31,048 --> 00:04:31,956
It imagined that for security, of course.

62
00:04:32,025 --> 00:04:33,618
I announce you that you can
to write a history... 

63
00:04:34,044 --> 00:04:36,512
 ... on what we are
making now in Afghanistan.

64
00:04:37,397 --> 00:04:38,951
Not six years ago, but now.

65
00:04:39,059 --> 00:04:40,644
The defense advisers
they have made sure... 

66
00:04:40,719 --> 00:04:42,017
 ... a sure victory.

67
00:04:43,258 --> 00:04:43,965
What is this?

68
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:45,690
This?

69
00:04:46,708 --> 00:04:47,480
This meeting.

70
00:04:48,141 --> 00:04:49,928
This is my best effort... 

71
00:04:51,265 --> 00:04:52,724
 ... to maintain to the
it presses well informed.

72
00:04:54,003 --> 00:04:55,169
And to change the matter... 

73
00:04:55,271 --> 00:04:56,566
 ... of the past to the future.

74
00:04:57,061 --> 00:04:57,905
And all the errors... 

75
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:01,121
 ... and to count about how
we work to amend them.

76
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:03,531
Step-by-step.

77
00:05:04,777 --> 00:05:06,144
How long do you have today?

78
00:05:07,123 --> 00:05:08,032
I have up to 11:00 o'clock.

79
00:05:08,978 --> 00:05:09,947
The complete hour?

80
00:05:11,908 --> 00:05:13,007
They should be terrified.

81
00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:13,984
Oh, not.

82
00:05:15,131 --> 00:05:16,391
We are resolved.

83
00:05:20,699 --> 00:05:23,457
Afghanistan. 6:30 p. m.
Hour of Afghanistan.

84
00:05:24,898 --> 00:05:26,883
BASE OF THE AIR FORCE DE BAGRAM

85
00:05:34,763 --> 00:05:35,446
Listen.

86
00:05:36,619 --> 00:05:37,817
Having Frinks,
did you make what I requested you?

87
00:05:38,019 --> 00:05:38,701
I already made it, Mister.

88
00:05:38,864 --> 00:05:39,636
How was it you?

89
00:05:39,775 --> 00:05:41,137
I was to 15 miles of the place.

90
00:05:41,307 --> 00:05:42,567
Very well. Rodríguez?

91
00:05:42,902 --> 00:05:43,671
All fact, Mister.

92
00:05:43,845 --> 00:05:46,706
Of agreement, I want them to take notes
because I want that they ask questions.

93
00:05:46,908 --> 00:05:48,041
Good news first.

94
00:05:48,176 --> 00:05:51,749
Al-Qaeda and the talibanes have you
reduced to a flock of wolves,

95
00:05:51,855 --> 00:05:54,229
so they don't create all it
that they read in the newspapers.

96
00:05:54,329 --> 00:05:57,220
We have been successful combatting to the one
enemy and we have weakened them... 

97
00:05:57,421 --> 00:05:59,073
 ... and we are more imposing
since we arrive here.

98
00:05:59,115 --> 00:05:59,808
That is good.

99
00:06:00,353 --> 00:06:02,328
The bad news, we have
that to continue combatting them,

100
00:06:02,924 --> 00:06:03,701
we have to close the attack,

101
00:06:04,292 --> 00:06:06,334
while we don't attack them,
stronger they become.

102
00:06:06,765 --> 00:06:07,897
Remember the motto.

103
00:06:08,426 --> 00:06:11,938
Never attacks for a lot
time to your enemy because... 

104
00:06:12,106 --> 00:06:13,172
He/she will adapt to your attack, Mister.

105
00:06:13,375 --> 00:06:15,517
He/she will adapt to your
attack, that is correct.

106
00:06:15,947 --> 00:06:16,686
Here the points are,

107
00:06:16,883 --> 00:06:17,573
study them.

108
00:06:17,705 --> 00:06:18,648
It has been reported... 

109
00:06:19,626 --> 00:06:23,328
 ... that Al-Qaeda plans to open up
a new front in this place.

110
00:06:23,468 --> 00:06:24,832
Are these data up-to-date, Mister?

111
00:06:24,901 --> 00:06:26,102
That is not the whole problem,

112
00:06:26,202 --> 00:06:28,925
there is not there sufficiently nobody him
strong to combat this enemy,

113
00:06:29,003 --> 00:06:32,025
the colonel says that we cannot leave
that these types leave now home.

114
00:06:32,127 --> 00:06:33,687
Then. Why the enemy
is this making now?

115
00:06:33,821 --> 00:06:36,317
What is happening is that the one
enemy intended to settle down... 

116
00:06:36,522 --> 00:06:39,250
 ... as a legitimate force of
it combats with the town, another time.

117
00:06:39,551 --> 00:06:41,493
Of where they would come this people?

118
00:06:41,634 --> 00:06:44,139
Van from door to door requesting him/her to
the families that you/they give to their children,

119
00:06:44,239 --> 00:06:47,557
if they don't give them their children, these they are
executed in front of their families,

120
00:06:47,690 --> 00:06:48,723
this it is the number one.

121
00:06:48,927 --> 00:06:50,611
The second, it is Iraq.

122
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:53,609
Al-Qaeda and the talibanes are
forming a front to continue... 

123
00:06:53,714 --> 00:06:54,683
To continue toward where, Mister?

124
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:57,326
That cannot say it. No
I can answer that question... 

125
00:06:58,011 --> 00:06:58,976
They already know too much.

126
00:07:01,558 --> 00:07:03,828
We are continuing to
terrorists refugees or... 

127
00:07:04,391 --> 00:07:05,853
 ... do we move to another territory, Mister?

128
00:07:05,888 --> 00:07:09,171
In the city they have become stronger
and the conditions are uglier,

129
00:07:09,275 --> 00:07:13,564
it is hour of hitting them
and to kick them the bottom.

130
00:07:13,768 --> 00:07:16,980
Van to make an attack
air in this place of here.

131
00:07:17,088 --> 00:07:19,523
We will establish a center of
operations, here, fair to their left... 

132
00:07:19,627 --> 00:07:21,286
 ... with 4 points of operations.

133
00:07:21,387 --> 00:07:25,286
We will fly to 8 thousand feet of height and
we will give turns of 360 on the valley.

134
00:07:25,488 --> 00:07:28,056
The enemy will want it
as much as us,

135
00:07:28,223 --> 00:07:31,276
so we have orders
of taking it before them.

136
00:07:31,577 --> 00:07:33,912
Chequeen their maps and their
portable localizers,

137
00:07:33,986 --> 00:07:34,692
do you already have it?

138
00:07:34,768 --> 00:07:35,643
- Yes Mister.
- Yes Mister.

139
00:07:35,745 --> 00:07:37,728
Van to make the camp,
they will be calmed,

140
00:07:37,827 --> 00:07:40,425
they won't lose temper, they go to
to wait patiently and... 

141
00:07:40,628 --> 00:07:42,381
 ... if fortunately
they face the enemy,

142
00:07:42,482 --> 00:07:44,725
they will present them all the
magnitude of the American wickedness.

143
00:07:44,858 --> 00:07:45,732
Are we clear?

144
00:07:47,365 --> 00:07:48,469
Concluded meeting.

145
00:07:54,302 --> 00:07:56,146
Are not we throwing, Mister?

146
00:08:01,368 --> 00:08:05,368
AN UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIAN DE
7:00 HOUR OF THE I PACIFY

147
00:08:22,462 --> 00:08:25,382
OFFICE OF THE PROFESSOR STEPHEN MALLEY

148
00:08:26,565 --> 00:08:28,149
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

149
00:08:28,226 --> 00:08:30,500
He/she wants him to close or... ?

150
00:08:30,862 --> 00:08:32,031
As you want, son.

151
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:38,861
Not it is ethical that he/she makes me bring him/her coffee.

152
00:08:39,002 --> 00:08:40,365
Not more than to make me look at that shirt.

153
00:08:40,467 --> 00:08:41,792
Oh, Doctor.

154
00:08:41,835 --> 00:08:45,021
It is of a genuine mark,
is it worth 89,99 or was it 69?

155
00:08:45,189 --> 00:08:47,032
Oh, seriously, Not you do want to return it?

156
00:08:49,552 --> 00:08:51,199
What did he/she make you come until here?

157
00:08:52,153 --> 00:08:52,865
The gift?

158
00:08:53,327 --> 00:08:54,068
Good, not.

159
00:08:55,281 --> 00:08:56,445
My sporadic absences.

160
00:08:56,843 --> 00:08:59,927
It sounds as if you wanted to make a
book of your acting in the semester.

161
00:09:00,327 --> 00:09:01,495
It would be a good idea.

162
00:09:03,127 --> 00:09:04,092
Yes, oh.

163
00:09:04,786 --> 00:09:08,194
Not I know, Doc. There was never
so busy state in my life.

164
00:09:08,792 --> 00:09:09,499
Why?

165
00:09:10,386 --> 00:09:11,818
Good, it is that with so many classes... 

166
00:09:13,090 --> 00:09:13,965
Is this your excuse?

167
00:09:14,163 --> 00:09:16,440
And there is also a girl.

168
00:09:16,801 --> 00:09:17,511
- Oh yes?
- Yes.

169
00:09:17,778 --> 00:09:22,260
It is that to who you harass so that you
to your side when you come to my class?

170
00:09:22,662 --> 00:09:23,366
No.

171
00:09:24,647 --> 00:09:26,176
How more it maintains you busy?

172
00:09:26,698 --> 00:09:27,570
People of my fraternity.

173
00:09:27,642 --> 00:09:28,328
Hey... 

174
00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:29,819
Alive the boss.

175
00:09:30,019 --> 00:09:31,473
Was it in that house, not?

176
00:09:31,679 --> 00:09:32,373
Yes.

177
00:09:32,526 --> 00:09:33,686
He/she remembers of how
busy you can be.

178
00:09:33,698 --> 00:09:36,073
Yes, during the end of
week and the 30 days... 

179
00:09:36,465 --> 00:09:37,892
He/she knows to that refer.

180
00:09:38,223 --> 00:09:39,255
Oh, yes, I remind myself.

181
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:41,992
Not he/she believes that it owes himself
to take a social life... 

182
00:09:42,489 --> 00:09:44,629
 ... at the same time of the studies
to have good education?

183
00:09:45,026 --> 00:09:47,004
I believe that a should be made
balance if you want to be here.

184
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:51,859
I also think when I smile,
in those boys of the forces,

185
00:09:52,061 --> 00:09:55,085
being about justifying their 30
thousand a year for all those seas.

186
00:09:58,407 --> 00:09:59,184
Let us see, my friend.

187
00:10:00,361 --> 00:10:01,627
You passed the exams,

188
00:10:03,128 --> 00:10:05,338
but, alone you came to
8 classes this semester,

189
00:10:05,832 --> 00:10:08,980
that is an entire record, alone
we see each other once a week.

190
00:10:09,641 --> 00:10:11,978
Then, my attendance is
does it leave of the evaluation, not?

191
00:10:16,478 --> 00:10:17,162
Of what do you speak?

192
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,941
You should win a good qualification
for the rest of the semester,

193
00:10:23,508 --> 00:10:26,273
Not more, not less, alone
a solid B of blue color.

194
00:10:28,196 --> 00:10:28,974
I can give you that.

195
00:10:29,369 --> 00:10:31,024
Right here, now.

196
00:10:32,202 --> 00:10:33,464
It is a shit.

197
00:10:34,352 --> 00:10:35,062
Why?

198
00:10:35,263 --> 00:10:36,588
Because you won't come to another class,

199
00:10:37,671 --> 00:10:40,014
for not to write or to read
a word that assigns you,

200
00:10:40,211 --> 00:10:43,426
for not writing in none of my
classes for the rest of your time.

201
00:10:45,876 --> 00:10:47,176
Would it be for anything, not?

202
00:10:47,927 --> 00:10:49,319
You know the ideas, this meeting finished.

203
00:10:51,541 --> 00:10:52,840
The whole class would kill for this treatment.

204
00:10:53,103 --> 00:10:54,497
But I am not meeting
with none of them.

205
00:10:56,491 --> 00:10:57,335
I understand that ago.

206
00:10:57,433 --> 00:10:58,700
Here there is another treatment, of two parts,

207
00:10:58,998 --> 00:11:00,848
both not negotiable.
The first part... 

208
00:11:01,828 --> 00:11:05,044
 ... you will appear every day, to
all the classes, starting from now.

209
00:11:05,442 --> 00:11:09,440
And the second, you will sit down beside those
last two boys that can help you.

210
00:11:10,262 --> 00:11:12,009
Maybe that explains for
what I called you this morning.

211
00:11:48,808 --> 00:11:50,654
You have the reflections of a fetus.

212
00:11:54,830 --> 00:11:57,133
How you don't have him/her more fear
to the shots and the bullets?

213
00:11:57,241 --> 00:12:00,293
Because I have written "bullets"
in my balls. Did you understand that?

214
00:12:08,570 --> 00:12:10,847
This is a call of the high control... 

215
00:12:11,046 --> 00:12:12,567
Yes, it is a call of the high control.

216
00:12:12,867 --> 00:12:14,915
But this call is for
the future that we have left.

217
00:12:15,342 --> 00:12:19,050
It is alone a sample of how we solve
the military problems first.

218
00:12:19,216 --> 00:12:21,980
Our soldiers of Forces
Special they have gone into enough... 

219
00:12:22,278 --> 00:12:24,386
 ... and they will occupy the position
before they think it,

220
00:12:24,621 --> 00:12:26,472
disabling the enemy's mobility.

221
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:29,368
And the military part has
that to arrive first. Why?

222
00:12:29,472 --> 00:12:31,226
Because alone after
let us eradicate the enemy,

223
00:12:31,915 --> 00:12:35,552
we will be able to carry out our
plan of making a new democracy.

224
00:12:35,852 --> 00:12:37,606
So it is basically to kill
people to help people.

225
00:12:37,774 --> 00:12:38,478
No.

226
00:12:38,946 --> 00:12:40,699
Not it is what I said, the enemy I said.

227
00:12:40,899 --> 00:12:42,254
You are leaving yourself the context.

228
00:12:42,559 --> 00:12:43,435
I sit down it, alone it tried of... 

229
00:12:43,568 --> 00:12:44,701
- Yes, I know it... 
- Good, we continue,

230
00:12:45,101 --> 00:12:47,179
in the 2002 you said something as:

231
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:50,078
 ... the talibanes retires, we broke
its center, had many applause... 

232
00:12:50,374 --> 00:12:52,193
Fulfilled, smaller mission.

233
00:12:54,151 --> 00:12:54,843
An error.

234
00:12:55,289 --> 00:12:55,972
Error?

235
00:12:56,070 --> 00:12:57,952
Because now we know that
the enemy was destroyed,

236
00:12:58,318 --> 00:13:00,168
but it continued alive and we also know... 

237
00:13:00,565 --> 00:13:02,706
 ... that the enemy learned the
lesson of that first setback.

238
00:13:02,843 --> 00:13:05,761
Not it is this way, it would be the second setback.

239
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:08,570
We would abandon this
meeting if I don't accept it?

240
00:13:09,354 --> 00:13:11,109
It will be this way the rest of
the hour in captivity?

241
00:13:11,731 --> 00:13:13,353
Alone I am asking questions.

242
00:13:13,555 --> 00:13:15,307
Senator Irving, alone
give me an example of the... 

243
00:13:15,898 --> 00:13:17,742
 ... enemy learning the lesson.

244
00:13:17,950 --> 00:13:21,198
They refused to the fact that
we were offering them friendship.

245
00:13:21,269 --> 00:13:24,296
And the history has demonstrated that you
do they punish that behavior class, not?

246
00:13:24,493 --> 00:13:27,617
So we throw this new one
strategy using to the military ones... 

247
00:13:27,652 --> 00:13:29,080
 ... as the entrance blow.

248
00:13:29,214 --> 00:13:31,457
To take their heights is key.

249
00:13:31,916 --> 00:13:34,648
Where he/she wants that we are, us
he/she gives the ability to observe,

250
00:13:34,748 --> 00:13:38,876
the possibility to attack and
the opportunity to preside over.

251
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,111
To preside over?

252
00:13:40,315 --> 00:13:41,614
As the Romans with their strong ones.

253
00:13:42,075 --> 00:13:44,897
You establish a constant presence
or you will have constant violence.

254
00:13:45,101 --> 00:13:47,474
Then, we will be there
for the good, as the Romans?

255
00:13:49,919 --> 00:13:52,491
I said constant, not permanent.

256
00:13:53,436 --> 00:13:56,748
We have to have patience and
determination to solve these urgencies.

257
00:13:56,856 --> 00:14:01,077
With the simple duration and the security
of building schools and clinical... 

258
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:03,290
But, when will we make all this?

259
00:14:03,496 --> 00:14:04,563
Good question, we are in it.

260
00:14:04,667 --> 00:14:06,845
Not we can wait to that
they decide to give us access,

261
00:14:07,045 --> 00:14:09,057
we have put this new one
strategy to work now.

262
00:14:09,064 --> 00:14:09,930
Why now?

263
00:14:10,235 --> 00:14:11,528
Why doesn't one year make?

264
00:14:11,604 --> 00:14:12,412
Or two years, or three years?

265
00:14:12,515 --> 00:14:13,546
For two reasons.

266
00:14:14,239 --> 00:14:15,141
The first reason.

267
00:14:15,705 --> 00:14:17,979
The satellites found that
they were full with ammunition.

268
00:14:18,244 --> 00:14:19,505
There is a market over there.

269
00:14:19,514 --> 00:14:21,946
Everybody knows that, alone
googlea Depredador or Global Hawk.

270
00:14:22,152 --> 00:14:23,643
The second reason is ugly.

271
00:14:23,746 --> 00:14:24,523
Ugly? What is that?

272
00:14:24,984 --> 00:14:26,440
A code stops outside of recording.

273
00:14:26,449 --> 00:14:27,939
A small parenthesis, yes.

274
00:14:30,585 --> 00:14:31,268
Of agreement.

275
00:14:32,398 --> 00:14:33,183
Iran.

276
00:14:33,317 --> 00:14:35,066
Iran. What are they making now?

277
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:38,292
They are building nuclear weapons,
negotiating with North Korea,

278
00:14:38,363 --> 00:14:41,283
and to count for their record. Them not
do they know like a true holocaust is?

279
00:14:42,564 --> 00:14:46,260
They are traveling of
Wa jabee to Afghanistan

280
00:14:46,337 --> 00:14:48,162
using the more direct possible road.

281
00:14:48,392 --> 00:14:50,214
Crossing from side to side to Iran.

282
00:14:53,667 --> 00:14:54,611
Is that confirmed?

283
00:14:54,806 --> 00:14:55,911
He/she has not refused,

284
00:14:56,076 --> 00:14:58,319
they prove their true ideas
of the new access to the wickedness.

285
00:14:59,983 --> 00:15:03,102
1300 years of murder among these
two countries are becoming in... 

286
00:15:03,304 --> 00:15:06,426
 ... comrades to be able to kill
more American in more places.

287
00:15:06,559 --> 00:15:07,590
Do we continue without registering?

288
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:10,169
Because this is really a history.

289
00:15:10,238 --> 00:15:11,500
That is negotiable.

290
00:15:11,799 --> 00:15:12,897
You see what I say.

291
00:15:13,071 --> 00:15:15,115
They are radical with its
union in against our.

292
00:15:16,098 --> 00:15:19,117
We have to remind to the town
American who are their enemies.

293
00:15:19,322 --> 00:15:21,751
They have tests that you is
uniting in against our,

294
00:15:22,087 --> 00:15:23,643
or you are saying that it is a potential... 

295
00:15:23,814 --> 00:15:26,964
No, don't underestimate our
fear that this happens.

296
00:15:27,559 --> 00:15:30,254
This is a significant threat
for the security of our nation... 

297
00:15:30,455 --> 00:15:31,917
 ... and you can believe me this.

298
00:15:33,029 --> 00:15:36,345
Now that they have potential
nuclear, simply we are not able to... 

299
00:15:36,510 --> 00:15:39,462
When you say nuclear it seems
kind of a statement... 

300
00:15:39,963 --> 00:15:42,171
You position shows certain lust.

301
00:15:42,861 --> 00:15:43,571
Mine not.

302
00:15:44,357 --> 00:15:47,351
It is my responsibility,
it is part of my work... 

303
00:15:48,026 --> 00:15:49,522
 ... to describe it stops to protect
to the American town.

304
00:15:49,664 --> 00:15:51,772
It is for this reason that there are
carried out this mission.

305
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:54,641
When will it begin?

306
00:15:57,349 --> 00:15:58,451
10 minutes ago.

307
00:16:05,290 --> 00:16:06,715
Hands up.

308
00:16:07,311 --> 00:16:08,668
Mr., they are 2 minutes.

309
00:16:09,458 --> 00:16:10,165
2 minutes.

310
00:16:10,632 --> 00:16:11,799
Load their weapons.

311
00:16:32,054 --> 00:16:33,484
There is a fair space there.

312
00:16:34,887 --> 00:16:36,117
Are you sure of what you say?

313
00:16:41,528 --> 00:16:42,370
Of foot.

314
00:16:46,249 --> 00:16:48,945
It is not well Mister,
there is rusty wire.

315
00:16:49,406 --> 00:16:52,270
They are 23 millimeters that we will bury ourselves.

316
00:16:54,812 --> 00:16:57,078
Rusty and pointed, inoperable.

317
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:58,615
Pointed? Who does say?

318
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:01,837
We won't be able to rush.

319
00:17:03,570 --> 00:17:04,308
What?

320
00:17:04,481 --> 00:17:07,310
If we rush we won't achieve this way it.

321
00:17:08,224 --> 00:17:12,385
Mr., I have seen this type of
I jump from the air the whole time.

322
00:17:12,781 --> 00:17:15,317
Let us fly over this inhospitable place.

323
00:17:24,241 --> 00:17:25,794
Wounded man, wounded man.

324
00:17:30,167 --> 00:17:31,465
We are losing altitude.

325
00:17:36,059 --> 00:17:37,982
Give me your things, give me your things.

326
00:17:39,153 --> 00:17:41,061
Having Foreman, Tte. Foreman.

327
00:17:57,939 --> 00:17:58,814
Earth, earth.

328
00:18:24,309 --> 00:18:25,085
What did he/she tell me that it was?

329
00:18:26,458 --> 00:18:27,911
Artist, Aryan music.

330
00:18:28,443 --> 00:18:29,475
As masterizar that music.

331
00:18:30,104 --> 00:18:31,536
We concentrate on the why.

332
00:18:31,928 --> 00:18:32,797
To what do you refer?

333
00:18:32,936 --> 00:18:34,295
Are you the doctor, hey?

334
00:18:34,369 --> 00:18:35,081
What?

335
00:18:35,086 --> 00:18:37,522
He/she already knows, that class of
people, alone it can be... 

336
00:18:38,765 --> 00:18:39,836
 ... African-American American.

337
00:18:40,035 --> 00:18:41,332
What does ago that differ?

338
00:18:41,923 --> 00:18:43,571
Concentrate on the American part.

339
00:18:44,070 --> 00:18:44,848
Of agreement.

340
00:18:46,024 --> 00:18:46,801
So they do play ball, hey?

341
00:18:47,294 --> 00:18:49,146
It is the only form that you
they can allow to come here.

342
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:50,515
They are this way the players.

343
00:18:51,495 --> 00:18:53,728
You want to walk with two
types different to me?

344
00:18:57,159 --> 00:18:58,123
What?

345
00:18:58,330 --> 00:19:00,762
You know, the professors
they are teachers that sell.

346
00:19:01,261 --> 00:19:03,405
Of agreement, what do you sell?

347
00:19:03,507 --> 00:19:04,285
To you for you.

348
00:19:05,006 --> 00:19:05,750
You know that not.

349
00:19:06,373 --> 00:19:08,096
Not he/she has to do me any favor, doc.

350
00:19:08,195 --> 00:19:09,592
Why is that, Tom?

351
00:19:09,792 --> 00:19:11,445
Why you don't have
that to do me favors?

352
00:19:11,614 --> 00:19:12,978
Why he/she already is not interested?

353
00:19:16,888 --> 00:19:18,376
How does he/she know that I was interested before?

354
00:19:18,453 --> 00:19:19,225
Did it demonstrate it to him in their classes?

355
00:19:19,234 --> 00:19:19,940
Yes.

356
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:22,477
You always showed it, you involved yourself.

357
00:19:23,041 --> 00:19:24,107
You made all that sent.

358
00:19:24,931 --> 00:19:26,540
You were hungry, you requested those classes,

359
00:19:26,735 --> 00:19:28,703
you had to emit your trial
in any debate.

360
00:19:28,838 --> 00:19:30,557
Now, the question
here es:Por how no longer?

361
00:19:30,693 --> 00:19:31,658
I already responded that, Mister.

362
00:19:33,136 --> 00:19:35,442
Many things. Small, the
fraternity, to socialize... 

363
00:19:35,772 --> 00:19:37,296
He/she hears, Tod, we go.

364
00:19:41,337 --> 00:19:42,181
Not I want to hurt their feelings.

365
00:19:43,163 --> 00:19:43,868
He/she hears,

366
00:19:44,823 --> 00:19:48,334
we have one hour, don't lose a
second worried by my feelings.

367
00:19:48,436 --> 00:19:50,221
Not I am worried by yours.

368
00:19:50,584 --> 00:19:52,658
Thank you, it has taken out all my letters.

369
00:19:54,622 --> 00:19:55,392
Of agreement, we go.

370
00:19:57,911 --> 00:19:58,619
It is well.

371
00:20:02,794 --> 00:20:04,247
The Political Sciences, doc.

372
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:07,797
What is there of scientific in that?

373
00:20:07,970 --> 00:20:10,335
Maybe in the psychology that
it is necessary to know all shit... 

374
00:20:10,444 --> 00:20:13,048
 ... it is spoken without they notice it.

375
00:20:13,766 --> 00:20:16,468
So this part, really
alone they worry about how to win.

376
00:20:17,054 --> 00:20:19,912
Not another thing, not how to make him/her
well to somebody, alone how to win.

377
00:20:20,276 --> 00:20:23,201
Not it cares how stupid, or
how criminal you have to be... 

378
00:20:23,206 --> 00:20:24,764
Give me an example.

379
00:20:25,486 --> 00:20:27,400
Of agreement, the one
president Kennedy is one.

380
00:20:28,286 --> 00:20:31,499
He/she announced their candidacy stopping
before a great audience... 

381
00:20:31,508 --> 00:20:33,484
 ... and saying in high voice
that he/she didn't want to be a president.

382
00:20:33,755 --> 00:20:34,469
Does he/she know?

383
00:20:34,731 --> 00:20:36,093
- Yes.
- Yes, what is that shit?

384
00:20:36,391 --> 00:20:37,104
That is last time.

385
00:20:37,565 --> 00:20:38,530
No, I don't believe it.

386
00:20:38,931 --> 00:20:42,022
Of agreement, you had me when
we studied the old philosophers.

387
00:20:42,285 --> 00:20:42,993
The Greek.

388
00:20:43,294 --> 00:20:46,192
Doc, you caught me,
they were astonishing.

389
00:20:46,681 --> 00:20:47,979
In some place... 

390
00:20:49,838 --> 00:20:50,523
 ... I got lost, I don't know it.

391
00:20:50,524 --> 00:20:51,887
At some time you have been in Greece?

392
00:20:52,053 --> 00:20:53,017
- No.
- No, of course that not.

393
00:20:53,224 --> 00:20:56,962
You only worry about others that had
a rationalized version of the future.

394
00:20:57,717 --> 00:20:58,717
That was not my point.

395
00:21:00,256 --> 00:21:04,547
Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, they could
to solve problems in a very easy way.

396
00:21:04,556 --> 00:21:05,854
How, abandoning?

397
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:09,140
I have to pay my taxes, I will have
that to pay the lights of the traffic... 

398
00:21:09,828 --> 00:21:12,262
He/she was thinking of something bigger.

399
00:21:12,953 --> 00:21:16,070
How what? To be a congress member?

400
00:21:17,348 --> 00:21:19,096
- That is bigger.
- Oh, yes.

401
00:21:19,238 --> 00:21:23,302
Super, and later I will give those trips
to the AD and I will be part of that shit.

402
00:21:23,534 --> 00:21:25,777
Those that make our laws,
I will have to be a puppet,

403
00:21:26,074 --> 00:21:27,829
that they comb themselves all of the same side.

404
00:21:27,832 --> 00:21:30,751
The type that he/she never says anything.
You know that I am never quiet.

405
00:21:30,926 --> 00:21:34,238
It could be the type that him
of lessons of morality,

406
00:21:34,344 --> 00:21:38,666
while they happen to me papers for
under the table, oh yes, please.

407
00:21:38,772 --> 00:21:41,013
The type that uses 1 million of
dollars that don't belong him/her and... 

408
00:21:41,147 --> 00:21:42,867
 ... they are never discovered.

409
00:21:43,005 --> 00:21:44,629
How many they are never captured.

410
00:21:45,316 --> 00:21:48,630
If that is something bigger than to be
a good man with a good work,

411
00:21:48,767 --> 00:21:49,609
I take it.

412
00:21:50,329 --> 00:21:51,560
Yes, it is for that reason that I lost.

413
00:21:58,013 --> 00:21:59,178
Almost you convince me.

414
00:22:02,539 --> 00:22:03,672
Almost you convince me.

415
00:22:03,678 --> 00:22:04,361
What?

416
00:22:04,753 --> 00:22:06,827
You really know of
what you are speaking?

417
00:22:07,584 --> 00:22:08,945
You are brilliant with the words,

418
00:22:09,538 --> 00:22:10,935
but, do you know that he/she would make you better?

419
00:22:11,392 --> 00:22:12,270
That you involved yourself.

420
00:22:12,761 --> 00:22:15,395
If they are confronted in
any type of experience.

421
00:22:15,528 --> 00:22:17,937
If you are not behind the doors,

422
00:22:18,069 --> 00:22:19,593
making a damned meeting,

423
00:22:19,695 --> 00:22:21,739
Alone you put on in the line of
any not well this thing.

424
00:22:21,878 --> 00:22:24,085
Confronting me, that is
to put on in the mean, not?

425
00:22:24,382 --> 00:22:26,814
You would make more than only speaking.

426
00:23:19,211 --> 00:23:19,920
Ernie?

427
00:23:24,582 --> 00:23:25,746
Brother.

428
00:23:29,172 --> 00:23:29,948
The left part,

429
00:23:30,538 --> 00:23:31,222
it is hot.

430
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:34,178
Not we should have left
to our parachutes.

431
00:23:34,186 --> 00:23:34,930
The pilots?

432
00:23:35,130 --> 00:23:37,504
They have been on board baleados and
they didn't land where they would should.

433
00:23:37,637 --> 00:23:38,413
Where did they land?

434
00:23:38,517 --> 00:23:40,238
We think that they are in the plateau.

435
00:23:40,339 --> 00:23:42,380
The troops are not well,
two lost men.

436
00:23:42,487 --> 00:23:43,201
Lost?

437
00:23:43,562 --> 00:23:44,822
Be in charge of of that, who does it lack?

438
00:23:44,929 --> 00:23:45,706
Vinch and Rodríguez.

439
00:23:46,101 --> 00:23:50,330
According to the informations, they should be
in a small place of flat LZ.

440
00:23:50,432 --> 00:23:52,380
They are not known if they can have survived.

441
00:24:05,082 --> 00:24:05,766
Ernie?

442
00:24:08,794 --> 00:24:09,737
Brother.

443
00:24:16,770 --> 00:24:17,547
Jodido idiot.

444
00:24:19,146 --> 00:24:19,989
How wrong are you?

445
00:24:27,319 --> 00:24:29,072
He/she hears, indicate me.

446
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:36,070
I am begun.

447
00:24:37,444 --> 00:24:38,187
He/she hears, he/she is Jim.

448
00:24:40,146 --> 00:24:40,852
It tolerates.

449
00:24:41,612 --> 00:24:43,064
How much does it delay the rescue troop?

450
00:24:43,076 --> 00:24:45,999
They are here, but they have to make
a perimeter to make us know,

451
00:24:46,008 --> 00:24:47,893
We won't put them in the same situation.

452
00:24:48,089 --> 00:24:50,002
Put them hidden for
that they tell us that it happens.

453
00:24:50,107 --> 00:24:51,599
Can we control everything?

454
00:24:51,606 --> 00:24:55,862
But I don't know since time, G2 is the one
to be covered by a snowfall that he/she comes at 71mph.

455
00:24:55,872 --> 00:24:58,536
It is about seeing the more than you can
for the possible biggest time.

456
00:24:58,605 --> 00:25:00,460
What you tell me of
to send him/her a sign express?

457
00:25:00,463 --> 00:25:03,416
I am working hard, I sent one ago
20 or 25 minutes saying: leave.

458
00:25:03,489 --> 00:25:04,654
- But those... 
- Code it.

459
00:25:04,791 --> 00:25:05,474
Make it.

460
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:09,247
He/she wanted to speak with prostitute's son
that he/she said that this area was sure.

461
00:25:09,285 --> 00:25:10,218
The Afghans cannot train,

462
00:25:10,261 --> 00:25:11,295
the commands are small,

463
00:25:11,304 --> 00:25:14,612
the specialized teams
they established 4 operation points.

464
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:17,448
I thought that they would be 4 operation bases,
but they are 4 operation points,

465
00:25:17,553 --> 00:25:20,081
a point for if alone it is
smaller than a base.

466
00:25:20,223 --> 00:25:21,455
Because it is it.

467
00:25:22,589 --> 00:25:23,338
What?

468
00:25:24,204 --> 00:25:24,907
I sit down it, not.

469
00:25:24,977 --> 00:25:25,944
Me alone... 

470
00:25:26,768 --> 00:25:29,169
That sounds as putting
the bait troops.

471
00:25:29,371 --> 00:25:33,304
Janine, is not as putting 1
or 2 types in the mountains.

472
00:25:34,485 --> 00:25:36,234
Small it is as we decide it.

473
00:25:36,631 --> 00:25:38,183
Alone they are men under those conditions.

474
00:25:38,293 --> 00:25:40,234
This is the war in the
that we are put... 

475
00:25:40,246 --> 00:25:42,816
 ... and unfortunately the civilization
it is not sustained for if alone... 

476
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:44,343
 ... if there is not an answer violence.

477
00:25:44,381 --> 00:25:47,570
What does that mean? Van to
to drain the diplomatic road?

478
00:25:47,669 --> 00:25:48,546
The State Department... 

479
00:25:48,744 --> 00:25:49,554
We will attack.

480
00:25:50,306 --> 00:25:53,036
Not you respond to an attack with diplomacy.

481
00:25:53,073 --> 00:25:56,781
The diplomacy is not made
with the idea of teaching.

482
00:25:57,533 --> 00:26:00,364
16 resolutions have been made
new in the UN,

483
00:26:00,561 --> 00:26:04,269
and the UN responded making 30 strong
declarations condemning their behavior.

484
00:26:04,370 --> 00:26:06,057
On the other hand France, China and Russia,

485
00:26:06,421 --> 00:26:08,367
the discussions continue for Sudan.

486
00:26:08,505 --> 00:26:10,447
And we don't arm
also to Sudan in those '80?

487
00:26:10,718 --> 00:26:11,718
But we are here now.

488
00:26:11,923 --> 00:26:14,843
Yes, we are here now and not
you believe that it is imposed to analyze... 

489
00:26:15,211 --> 00:26:16,088
 ... as we arrive to this point.

490
00:26:16,286 --> 00:26:18,040
How and why the matter is not now.

491
00:26:18,436 --> 00:26:21,553
We have to move ahead, we are
fighting against the nickname of evil.

492
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:26,733
The 1300 years of the human progress they have
been marked by the violence and the death.

493
00:26:26,868 --> 00:26:29,176
Now, if that is something that you not
that should be shown... 

494
00:26:29,375 --> 00:26:32,139
I, would like me him to be spoken
of that more than anyone,

495
00:26:32,273 --> 00:26:35,258
but I don't understand how it is that
you don't want to look to the past,

496
00:26:35,690 --> 00:26:36,533
I believe that it is decisive.

497
00:26:36,732 --> 00:26:39,194
What is decisive,
what is outstanding... 

498
00:26:39,955 --> 00:26:43,298
 ... it is the implementation of this new one
strategy that we will make in this war.

499
00:26:44,057 --> 00:26:46,299
A war that we cannot lose.

500
00:26:46,402 --> 00:26:47,179
But we are not winning it.

501
00:26:47,475 --> 00:26:48,253
Still.

502
00:26:48,973 --> 00:26:50,894
This new strategy can change that.

503
00:26:51,187 --> 00:26:53,557
What there is of the strategy
of bringing to the troops to house?

504
00:26:57,928 --> 00:26:58,732
Then veto.

505
00:26:58,936 --> 00:26:59,679
That is not an option.

506
00:27:04,861 --> 00:27:05,927
Of agreement, we go... 

507
00:27:07,010 --> 00:27:07,720
to put it this way.

508
00:27:08,866 --> 00:27:09,641
We were... 

509
00:27:11,048 --> 00:27:12,700
 ... to Afghanistan in a
beginning for the talibanes.

510
00:27:13,944 --> 00:27:17,352
Alone that now the talibanes has
made of this a bigger problem... 

511
00:27:17,753 --> 00:27:20,418
 ... because they have given to
to glitter their super powers.

512
00:27:21,399 --> 00:27:22,699
They pushed people that voted for... 

513
00:27:22,895 --> 00:27:24,477
 ... they, were it
sufficiently stupid... 

514
00:27:24,511 --> 00:27:26,047
 ... to put their faith in our world.

515
00:27:26,055 --> 00:27:28,591
So to call it now the end of the
it thrills to put an end to the life of... 

516
00:27:28,692 --> 00:27:30,806
 ... 10 millions of Afghan for the one
end of the credibility of America.

517
00:27:30,874 --> 00:27:33,505
The end of America is a force
for the incorrect thing in the world.

518
00:27:34,032 --> 00:27:35,164
- When the Americans... ?
- And when our forces... 

519
00:27:35,399 --> 00:27:37,053
 ... return in a couple of
years, please, record you this.

520
00:27:37,841 --> 00:27:39,562
Jodidos will be against
a shit like Iraq... 

521
00:27:39,893 --> 00:27:43,204
 ... and the hopeless one
Afghanistan already nuclear Iran.

522
00:27:43,994 --> 00:27:45,447
How many troops will we need then?

523
00:27:45,557 --> 00:27:48,444
I guarantee you that you will request that they return.

524
00:27:50,149 --> 00:27:51,609
Can I speak freely?

525
00:27:52,362 --> 00:27:56,356
You are when implementing
another new strategy... 

526
00:27:56,463 --> 00:28:00,360
 ... without keeping in mind the human cost or the one
financial cost because you predict... 

527
00:28:00,566 --> 00:28:03,586
We think deeply of the cost
human to plan this strategy.

528
00:28:03,985 --> 00:28:05,050
What did they estimate, exactly?

529
00:28:05,257 --> 00:28:08,466
What I can say is that this
strategy has patience... 

530
00:28:08,511 --> 00:28:09,477
 ... and determination in their course... 

531
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:13,648
 ... and it assures that we can in few minutes
to face, to combat and to kill the enemy.

532
00:28:14,434 --> 00:28:16,964
This way, at the end we can go
and to reconstruct that country.

533
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:20,390
If it delays 10 years to make it,
we will make that it is necessary.

534
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:21,173
That that... 

535
00:28:22,249 --> 00:28:23,125
 ... be necessary.

536
00:28:23,446 --> 00:28:24,522
That is necessary.

537
00:28:27,718 --> 00:28:30,616
Why did he/she take 3 years to make this?

538
00:28:30,779 --> 00:28:32,433
He are now and constitutionally... 

539
00:28:32,635 --> 00:28:35,165
I don't set that he/she has the same one
protection, senator and you know it.

540
00:28:35,857 --> 00:28:38,288
Why the president insists
in spending trillions in... 

541
00:28:38,787 --> 00:28:42,040
 ... submarines and combat airplanes?
Totally useless in this type of... 

542
00:28:42,207 --> 00:28:43,172
In what do you believe that I am working?

543
00:28:43,379 --> 00:28:47,796
Why we send 150 thousand troops
to a country that didn't attack us?

544
00:28:48,457 --> 00:28:50,110
Because there is not an alone one
name of somebody... 

545
00:28:50,214 --> 00:28:52,590
How many times will you ask the same thing?

546
00:28:53,535 --> 00:28:54,793
Until we have the answer.

547
00:28:54,903 --> 00:28:55,586
Of agreement.

548
00:28:56,270 --> 00:28:56,955
Here he/she goes.

549
00:28:58,322 --> 00:29:00,371
Iraq was almost the first country of the world.

550
00:29:00,569 --> 00:29:01,445
To what does this come?

551
00:29:01,839 --> 00:29:03,390
We take it quick because
we hate that number.

552
00:29:03,889 --> 00:29:08,086
Afghanistan was, it is and it will always be
the definition of the Third World.

553
00:29:08,284 --> 00:29:10,039
They were developed before... 

554
00:29:10,368 --> 00:29:11,500
Alejandro became the Great" one.

555
00:29:11,702 --> 00:29:13,156
Do We Take Iraq?

556
00:29:13,688 --> 00:29:14,432
How did I get lost that?

557
00:29:14,730 --> 00:29:16,581
Militarily, we made it.

558
00:29:17,075 --> 00:29:18,529
We made errors.

559
00:29:20,005 --> 00:29:20,970
Colossal errors,

560
00:29:22,056 --> 00:29:23,414
that should never be forgotten.

561
00:29:27,427 --> 00:29:31,235
But 6 years ago, without
to care who had made it,

562
00:29:32,603 --> 00:29:35,141
after seeing our jets
flying toward the buildings,

563
00:29:36,054 --> 00:29:40,022
you remember that petrified that we are
when our enemies made this?

564
00:29:40,223 --> 00:29:45,786
And how everything was in risk,
our families, friends, the children.

565
00:29:46,115 --> 00:29:48,424
Ríos and bridges, implant nuclear.

566
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:52,751
You remind the color of that place the... 

567
00:29:53,045 --> 00:29:55,775
 ... following tomorrow that
had not we seen before?

568
00:29:58,681 --> 00:30:04,052
The defense didn't work, for that
fear and the mysteries expired.

569
00:30:05,032 --> 00:30:08,672
But the question not
accuse me of denying it,

570
00:30:09,459 --> 00:30:11,180
because I have the answer.

571
00:30:11,574 --> 00:30:13,064
Is it what we make now?

572
00:30:35,048 --> 00:30:35,732
First platoon?

573
00:30:40,453 --> 00:30:41,718
Oh, my God, they are moving.

574
00:30:57,512 --> 00:30:58,197
They are alive.

575
00:30:58,295 --> 00:30:58,977
Of agreement.

576
00:31:01,353 --> 00:31:04,251
- This stone flew.
- Why would that be?

577
00:31:04,642 --> 00:31:06,887
Give me the pilot's number,
I want to send him/her a message.

578
00:31:06,889 --> 00:31:07,758
They said in 18 minutes.

579
00:31:07,801 --> 00:31:10,109
That was 7 minutes ago. I want
to speak now with the pilot.

580
00:31:10,730 --> 00:31:15,019
Mr., the rescatistas is there
out waiting for their words.

581
00:31:17,079 --> 00:31:19,421
The types in Iran, are voluntary.

582
00:31:20,301 --> 00:31:21,246
Is that a question or a statement?

583
00:31:23,329 --> 00:31:24,688
Of agreement, alone a question.

584
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:26,644
Yes, they are voluntary.

585
00:31:26,749 --> 00:31:28,015
They are of the violent type,

586
00:31:28,214 --> 00:31:29,379
they like the extreme thing, those types... 

587
00:31:29,777 --> 00:31:32,212
No, not. They are a type
ordinary of people.

588
00:31:32,348 --> 00:31:35,927
Of what was speaking it was of
the courage, to be panicky,

589
00:31:36,548 --> 00:31:39,051
but to start to yourself
in the next step.

590
00:31:39,543 --> 00:31:40,835
That is anger.

591
00:31:41,432 --> 00:31:42,663
But of the true type.

592
00:31:44,166 --> 00:31:45,988
To what are you him/her afraid, Tob?

593
00:31:46,705 --> 00:31:48,552
Most of people have
fear of not obtaining a work,

594
00:31:48,659 --> 00:31:51,844
or of moving with their parents,
or to study a lot of time.

595
00:31:52,273 --> 00:31:53,216
Yes, that also scares me, Doc.

596
00:31:53,510 --> 00:31:54,581
Or the voice in your head,

597
00:31:54,814 --> 00:31:58,483
that he/she makes you ask como:Estaré
exploiting all my talents?

598
00:31:58,590 --> 00:32:01,154
Not I will be wasting
the time in this planet?

599
00:32:01,323 --> 00:32:04,086
I believe that everybody you
he/she asks those same questions.

600
00:32:04,156 --> 00:32:06,918
Many people have
fear of the answers.

601
00:32:07,315 --> 00:32:10,406
You remind yourself of second o'clock or
third lesson that I imparted you?

602
00:32:10,797 --> 00:32:12,351
When I called you to the slate.

603
00:32:12,459 --> 00:32:14,596
You said: In any side,
that that most of you... 

604
00:32:14,736 --> 00:32:15,968
 ... when they don't want
to be called to speak.

605
00:32:16,365 --> 00:32:18,437
Of course that not you
they feel committed.

606
00:32:18,709 --> 00:32:21,534
But here there is a form
from the one that I can her... 

607
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:23,326
 ... to see it, it is Colony.

608
00:32:23,430 --> 00:32:26,549
That embarrassed me, he/she asked me
when he/she thought of the reading... 

609
00:32:26,946 --> 00:32:28,311
 ... and me alone I said: I didn't read it.

610
00:32:28,509 --> 00:32:29,193
But you meditated.

611
00:32:29,811 --> 00:32:31,630
Without excuses, without shits, honest.

612
00:32:32,024 --> 00:32:33,293
Alone it was panicky.

613
00:32:33,394 --> 00:32:35,369
But, you overcame
and you took the other step.

614
00:32:36,224 --> 00:32:38,461
Do you remember of what we were speaking?

615
00:32:38,602 --> 00:32:39,445
About what was it the reading?

616
00:32:39,838 --> 00:32:41,492
I am about blocking bad moments.

617
00:32:42,313 --> 00:32:44,813
It was about the panic, of as
he/she makes us open the senses.

618
00:32:44,916 --> 00:32:47,644
They were selling needles
you clean free, for the addicts,

619
00:32:48,434 --> 00:32:50,676
in the class there were people that
they said that it was very good idea,

620
00:32:50,811 --> 00:32:54,222
they said, yes, that would avoid
illnesses and maybe something of the crime,

621
00:32:54,977 --> 00:32:55,661
and your you said... 

622
00:32:56,150 --> 00:32:59,074
If we will spend dollars of taxes,
our dollars of taxes,

623
00:32:59,274 --> 00:33:01,027
to help people to violate
the law in a sure way.

624
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:04,830
Why we don't have a drunk driver
also designated for the highways?

625
00:33:04,843 --> 00:33:05,526
What?

626
00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:07,085
That would not be a problem
for those that use drugs.

627
00:33:07,512 --> 00:33:08,544
And he/she has the same logic exactly.

628
00:33:08,711 --> 00:33:09,424
They are speaking economically.

629
00:33:09,823 --> 00:33:11,966
I am speaking of economy and
I am also speaking of security.

630
00:33:12,102 --> 00:33:14,701
He/she waits one minute, you have just admitted it,
you not even read yourself the article.

631
00:33:14,837 --> 00:33:16,657
I know it, I didn't make it, but
it is some logic... 

632
00:33:16,877 --> 00:33:17,561
He/she is right.

633
00:33:20,664 --> 00:33:22,352
I am the boy that doesn't read anything, Doc.

634
00:33:22,489 --> 00:33:24,896
Yes, the boy that one doesn't read
the article and it admits it... 

635
00:33:25,875 --> 00:33:30,887
 ... he/she becomes the center of one of the debates
more interesting of those than I have been part.

636
00:33:31,441 --> 00:33:33,093
To where that boy was?

637
00:33:35,545 --> 00:33:37,099
So you think that... 

638
00:33:37,203 --> 00:33:40,033
 ... the number of troops that we have
in Afghanistan now is enough.

639
00:33:40,721 --> 00:33:44,520
Yes, and a great part that there are not
been able to make more with less in Afghanistan,

640
00:33:44,659 --> 00:33:47,748
he/she is due to the intelligence
precise that have in the area.

641
00:33:47,948 --> 00:33:49,895
It is the pure nature of
our special forces.

642
00:33:50,130 --> 00:33:51,298
They are these boys.

643
00:33:51,496 --> 00:33:53,473
These boys are some professionals.

644
00:33:53,613 --> 00:33:56,081
That reminds me to TO. Bob, in the '68.

645
00:33:56,152 --> 00:33:57,939
- To. Bob?
- Yes, do you remember?

646
00:33:59,504 --> 00:34:00,448
How long does he/she make of that?

647
00:34:00,548 --> 00:34:02,979
Not they could face to those
Vietcom with big fights,

648
00:34:03,021 --> 00:34:06,205
so they sent to small groups for
that they could not resist to ambush us.

649
00:34:06,277 --> 00:34:07,701
At least he/she fought.

650
00:34:07,742 --> 00:34:11,118
58 thousand names said that
it cost that new strategy.

651
00:34:11,291 --> 00:34:14,699
Which is your problem with the evolution?

652
00:34:14,905 --> 00:34:17,833
With platoons again type of
soldiers of special forces,

653
00:34:17,932 --> 00:34:19,950
surgically they opened to the enemy.

654
00:34:20,049 --> 00:34:21,214
But again, those
platoons are small.

655
00:34:21,416 --> 00:34:24,699
Another time, small it is the objective.

656
00:34:25,485 --> 00:34:28,802
To. Bob, you were
seeing History Channel?

657
00:34:29,132 --> 00:34:30,142
No.

658
00:34:30,889 --> 00:34:32,543
The '68 were my first year like reporter,

659
00:34:33,006 --> 00:34:34,007
it was my periodic school.

660
00:34:34,041 --> 00:34:34,724
The Same as Iraq.

661
00:34:35,155 --> 00:34:35,839
Yes.

662
00:34:36,165 --> 00:34:37,914
I never lost for that reason my pleasure.

663
00:34:38,412 --> 00:34:39,639
I am fortunate.

664
00:34:42,350 --> 00:34:44,559
- 1968?
- Yes, you were 6 years old.

665
00:34:45,606 --> 00:34:47,003
He/she already read in the sixth grade.

666
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,025
40 years in this work.

667
00:34:50,978 --> 00:34:52,665
Not you have to say the
address of the laugh.

668
00:34:53,028 --> 00:34:55,692
40 years it means that you should
to have enough you leave... 

669
00:34:56,934 --> 00:34:58,787
 ... to know to what me
I refer with my words.

670
00:34:59,572 --> 00:35:02,697
The American town needs to understand
that it is not alone our decision... 

671
00:35:02,862 --> 00:35:05,425
 ... to stop these insurgencias,
but it is a moral obligation.

672
00:35:05,791 --> 00:35:09,823
Simply we cannot allow that
form wickedness and terror to spread.

673
00:35:10,446 --> 00:35:12,588
If we specify of these
work military,

674
00:35:13,604 --> 00:35:15,193
we will take this as first step.

675
00:35:15,559 --> 00:35:16,241
First step?

676
00:35:16,862 --> 00:35:19,951
What we have been making in
the past 6 years, senator?

677
00:35:20,442 --> 00:35:22,362
Second World War lasted the same thing.

678
00:35:36,475 --> 00:35:37,297
Date the turn.

679
00:35:38,412 --> 00:35:39,356
I have to see it well.

680
00:35:40,659 --> 00:35:42,118
He/she looks at this component.

681
00:35:47,366 --> 00:35:48,049
Oh, my God.

682
00:36:10,912 --> 00:36:11,709
You need a tourniquet.

683
00:36:13,087 --> 00:36:13,863
How will I make it?

684
00:36:35,453 --> 00:36:36,907
It pushes hard, brother. It pushes hard.

685
00:36:37,536 --> 00:36:39,649
- Shit.
- The rescue is in road.

686
00:36:55,475 --> 00:36:57,230
Not there is anything that he/she makes me change idea.

687
00:36:57,233 --> 00:37:00,064
Senator, the American town doesn't go to
to accept that another strategy is made,

688
00:37:00,261 --> 00:37:05,237
a more than he/she transforms into one
forgotten mission or an error of the past.

689
00:37:05,438 --> 00:37:06,990
He/she can tell me, with
their own words,

690
00:37:07,521 --> 00:37:09,863
exactly where you
does he/she believe that we make a mistake?

691
00:37:16,311 --> 00:37:17,964
Losing the time in our history

692
00:37:19,242 --> 00:37:21,573
Taken decisions and not carried out.

693
00:37:23,376 --> 00:37:24,507
Public Bad Relationships.

694
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:26,753
Public Bad Relationships?

695
00:37:28,650 --> 00:37:31,837
You can say that I hate it,
but that is what I think.

696
00:37:32,948 --> 00:37:34,696
At some time it did bleed in a battle?

697
00:37:36,334 --> 00:37:37,731
Intelligence, 6 years.

698
00:37:38,189 --> 00:37:39,388
But not in the combat, truth?

699
00:37:39,882 --> 00:37:43,101
That knows it, I graduated the one
first of my class in West Point,

700
00:37:43,204 --> 00:37:44,989
I paid my studies in the Intelligence.

701
00:37:45,255 --> 00:37:47,196
Are you asking me me to apologize?

702
00:37:47,403 --> 00:37:48,536
No, no, he/she would never make that.

703
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:59,902
Here we are having a... 

704
00:38:00,068 --> 00:38:03,476
 ... it debates intelligent Preposition
of the war and the politics... 

705
00:38:03,878 --> 00:38:08,883
 ... and it has just happened me that don't go to
to be able to arm a true history... 

706
00:38:09,150 --> 00:38:13,769
 ... among the freedom that you have of
to expose all the bestialities... 

707
00:38:14,556 --> 00:38:16,697
 ... and all your
entertainments in the net.

708
00:38:18,592 --> 00:38:21,489
I have to have my fingers crossed for
seven seconds in that I mentioned you... 

709
00:38:21,685 --> 00:38:25,005
 ... that group that you creó and that baker.

710
00:38:25,690 --> 00:38:29,586
Apologize, it is Summer
Hernandez Kawalski.

711
00:38:30,183 --> 00:38:32,459
Is that their true name?

712
00:38:35,358 --> 00:38:36,331
What does it pass you?

713
00:38:37,347 --> 00:38:39,092
When they became
in some Windsock?

714
00:38:39,364 --> 00:38:40,046
What?

715
00:38:40,242 --> 00:38:43,170
Windsock, flies with
the prevalent breeze.

716
00:38:43,368 --> 00:38:46,915
When they began to confuse the opinion
of most with the correct opinion?

717
00:38:46,982 --> 00:38:49,807
It will have been when
do we support the going toward Iraq?

718
00:38:49,944 --> 00:38:50,879
Support?

719
00:38:51,704 --> 00:38:53,558
No, no, you not.

720
00:38:54,535 --> 00:38:57,132
To you never them
I care the invasion to Iraq.

721
00:38:57,922 --> 00:39:00,840
Alone they cared to scream
to the splendid one marine... 

722
00:39:01,340 --> 00:39:04,299
 ... and the racing car eagle furrowing the air.

723
00:39:04,466 --> 00:39:08,273
That is for that believe that
Iraq is a legitimate enemy.

724
00:39:08,470 --> 00:39:09,635
They are a legitimate enemy.

725
00:39:09,740 --> 00:39:12,603
They have the benefit of the doubt
because we have troops and weapons far.

726
00:39:12,605 --> 00:39:15,626
Your net provides that benefit
without our consent.

727
00:39:16,673 --> 00:39:17,937
We give it to you.

728
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:21,385
Us two,

729
00:39:21,493 --> 00:39:22,265
Janine,

730
00:39:23,510 --> 00:39:24,876
both make chancy things,

731
00:39:28,296 --> 00:39:30,343
but I have admitted my errors.

732
00:39:31,650 --> 00:39:32,427
When will you make it you?

733
00:39:35,915 --> 00:39:37,508
The conference, will senator, take a long time?

734
00:39:37,706 --> 00:39:39,718
Thank you, request them some
seconds, please.

735
00:39:41,581 --> 00:39:42,291
Not he/she makes sense,

736
00:39:44,250 --> 00:39:45,512
we are in the same team.

737
00:39:45,814 --> 00:39:46,748
We are comrades.

738
00:39:47,051 --> 00:39:48,316
Both have responsibilities.

739
00:39:49,686 --> 00:39:50,397
You have already solved them.

740
00:39:51,543 --> 00:39:54,074
Now I am requesting to you that
help me to find a solution.

741
00:39:54,864 --> 00:39:56,612
Apologize, I have that
to assist this call.

742
00:39:57,012 --> 00:39:58,178
You can use the telephone of here.

743
00:39:59,291 --> 00:40:01,699
You believe that I will leave you
to listen to me to request money?

744
00:40:58,283 --> 00:41:03,067
If I should choose among the correct thing
and the peace, I choose the correct thing.

745
00:41:10,949 --> 00:41:12,890
The new weapons of the Capitol.

746
00:41:14,237 --> 00:41:17,094
THE senator Jasper Irving, has the one
potential of giving him/her a new force,

747
00:41:17,459 --> 00:41:20,480
 ... to very needy GOP,
as same he/she made it Kennedy.

748
00:41:21,074 --> 00:41:25,371
Irving is the new hope, the one
future of Republican Party.

749
00:41:25,989 --> 00:41:29,081
Somebody that is able to redefine it.

750
00:41:45,198 --> 00:41:46,363
Why do they wait?

751
00:41:46,794 --> 00:41:48,226
Maybe they love each other alive.

752
00:41:49,789 --> 00:41:51,087
Them if they know as.

753
00:42:06,524 --> 00:42:07,300
Care.

754
00:42:08,673 --> 00:42:10,648
Care.

755
00:42:17,202 --> 00:42:18,923
Ok, the team 1 are who puts the base.

756
00:42:19,351 --> 00:42:24,490
What external relationships or
politicians can be applied,

757
00:42:25,374 --> 00:42:27,806
 ... to. C. at home, for
a better answer?

758
00:42:28,630 --> 00:42:30,871
I equip 1, already begin,
to favor or in against.

759
00:42:52,819 --> 00:42:54,707
These well, these clever one to make it?

760
00:42:54,903 --> 00:42:56,457
- If.
- He/she breathes.

761
00:42:57,020 --> 00:42:58,673
- I am breathing.
- He/she breathes.

762
00:42:59,364 --> 00:43:02,615
They have to forgive it, this
crazy to give me a good note.

763
00:43:03,075 --> 00:43:05,505
That he/she can that he/she gets dirty those
pants or it swallows himself the language.

764
00:43:08,479 --> 00:43:11,599
If somebody wants something
of that, this it is GPA

765
00:43:16,684 --> 00:43:19,547
- And you Doc?
- What am there with me?

766
00:43:19,743 --> 00:43:21,886
What but he/she can make to part of teaching?

767
00:43:22,771 --> 00:43:27,610
Seriously, to be a professor,
it is it that better he/she can make.

768
00:43:29,088 --> 00:43:30,386
You have me.

769
00:43:32,016 --> 00:43:36,636
You know, 30 years ago I thought that
this serious different work.

770
00:43:37,781 --> 00:43:40,932
It will publish theories that you/they went to
to change to people that read them.

771
00:43:41,491 --> 00:43:43,922
The parents of the university
they would be so impressed,

772
00:43:44,227 --> 00:43:47,380
 ... that they will give me season entrances
of the 50 alone so that I stayed.

773
00:43:47,743 --> 00:43:49,686
For heaven's sake, tremendous dream.

774
00:43:50,021 --> 00:43:52,032
- Not you do believe?
- If, hey.

775
00:43:52,822 --> 00:43:54,378
The things that public nobody doesn't read them.

776
00:43:54,580 --> 00:43:57,794
The students still
they come and they ask me things,

777
00:43:57,932 --> 00:43:59,651
 ... but the school still
he/she writes my bad name where he/she wants.

778
00:43:59,691 --> 00:44:01,020
Then you do continue here for the money?

779
00:44:01,156 --> 00:44:02,810
Money? My God, not.

780
00:44:05,161 --> 00:44:07,337
I am still here
because I am a selfish person.

781
00:44:09,393 --> 00:44:13,556
I am selfish until when you know well
that there is somebody in your same class,

782
00:44:13,886 --> 00:44:16,483
 ... that he/she has the capacity of
to make big things, to great scale.

783
00:44:17,207 --> 00:44:21,558
I realized that my capacity is
of recognizing the potential in others.

784
00:44:21,798 --> 00:44:24,328
And maybe to help them a
little when they need it.

785
00:44:24,791 --> 00:44:27,423
- Do you believe that I am this way?
- Your that you believe?

786
00:44:30,848 --> 00:44:35,532
They demonstrated you that
they were strange every day.

787
00:44:35,732 --> 00:44:37,514
Alone so that the doubt arose.

788
00:44:37,717 --> 00:44:39,825
The only difference between your and them.

789
00:44:41,396 --> 00:44:44,904
It is that him yours is natural, and
they had to work a lot.

790
00:44:45,044 --> 00:44:46,697
It was not them easy, like to you.

791
00:44:46,899 --> 00:44:49,333
That and that they could give him/her
to a ball to 90 miles.

792
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:51,188
Me me exchange with them.

793
00:44:51,391 --> 00:44:53,009
No, they changed you for you.

794
00:44:53,052 --> 00:44:55,948
They went to the secondary
in the area where they grew.

795
00:44:56,178 --> 00:44:59,394
A forgotten place for heaven's sake, neither
resemblance to where we were your and me.

796
00:45:00,051 --> 00:45:03,237
Detecting of metal in each
door, the teachers with spray.

797
00:45:03,892 --> 00:45:06,425
And these horrible places
they didn't do him/her a favor.

798
00:45:08,222 --> 00:45:11,022
- I saw the same thing in Vietnam.
- What?

799
00:45:11,610 --> 00:45:15,117
The first in signing were
those that the country doesn't try well.

800
00:45:15,646 --> 00:45:19,808
And you have Ernesto and Aarón going to these
neighborhoods where people are killed,

801
00:45:20,008 --> 00:45:22,051
 ... for the things but ridiculous.

802
00:45:22,289 --> 00:45:24,530
Your neighborhood was to the south of mine.

803
00:45:24,795 --> 00:45:27,358
The churre in your car
it is better than mine.

804
00:45:28,018 --> 00:45:31,726
And what they make after they leave
of those places in a piece?

805
00:45:33,195 --> 00:45:36,114
Van to fight for the same country
that it ignores those neighborhoods,

806
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:38,850
 ... unless there is
a revolt or something like that.

807
00:45:38,884 --> 00:45:41,029
And then they have some boys that... 

808
00:45:41,078 --> 00:45:43,336
 ... they take advantage of what gives them the country.

809
00:45:44,035 --> 00:45:45,102
Is it as me?

810
00:45:45,305 --> 00:45:47,835
And very often they are those
that they throw it stops behind,

811
00:45:48,039 --> 00:45:49,695
 ... when volunteers request.

812
00:45:51,849 --> 00:45:54,580
- Me this recruiting?
- Recruiting?

813
00:45:54,716 --> 00:45:56,625
I speak to them of the I exercise
to Ernesto and Aarón,

814
00:45:56,830 --> 00:45:59,749
 ... and now he/she wants me to go.

815
00:46:03,343 --> 00:46:07,406
Three of them didn't come to
he/she marries, one in prison of for life.

816
00:46:08,682 --> 00:46:11,212
Do you want to see the worst wound that I had?

817
00:46:13,271 --> 00:46:16,102
54 points to protest in
Chicago, after I came home.

818
00:46:16,788 --> 00:46:18,476
I made that opposed to recruit them.

819
00:46:19,621 --> 00:46:21,019
Do I like that they made? No.

820
00:46:21,184 --> 00:46:22,248
Did it agree with that? No.

821
00:46:22,388 --> 00:46:23,753
In fact I broke the heart,

822
00:46:23,820 --> 00:46:25,897
 ... but that doesn't mean that not
I respect the reasons for those that were.

823
00:46:25,904 --> 00:46:29,901
They were because they thought that the best
way to make something was go to fight.

824
00:46:32,221 --> 00:46:36,506
It combats, it combats it is the politics
external that wanted to apply at home.

825
00:46:36,811 --> 00:46:42,505
We agree in that the secretary
of state it travels but that any.

826
00:46:42,899 --> 00:46:45,241
And we have but embassies that never before.

827
00:46:45,439 --> 00:46:48,424
Its first point, is not
because they have many airplanes.

828
00:46:49,116 --> 00:46:52,718
Not there is but countries now
to have embassies?

829
00:46:54,326 --> 00:46:59,360
We cannot fly those airplanes and
not to recognize the new countries.

830
00:46:59,471 --> 00:47:02,719
But to make it, it is I believe combat.

831
00:47:03,702 --> 00:47:07,900
We are very good in the one
it combats in other countries.

832
00:47:08,196 --> 00:47:10,923
- But we have also failed.
- For example?

833
00:47:11,842 --> 00:47:14,739
As September 11, and Rowamda.

834
00:47:15,032 --> 00:47:18,473
Somalia, the communist country
to 90 miles of Miami.

835
00:47:18,678 --> 00:47:21,110
We need but of 15 minutes
to be able to speak of that.

836
00:47:21,317 --> 00:47:22,680
No country is perfect.

837
00:47:22,942 --> 00:47:24,497
All the countries
they should want to be better.

838
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:27,922
He/she looks, boy if you don't care it,

839
00:47:28,315 --> 00:47:31,235
 ... we wanted to use the time that
we have left it to continue in the combat.

840
00:47:31,636 --> 00:47:34,855
And as we see it to it was and not
we see the same thing in the street.

841
00:47:36,064 --> 00:47:39,539
We give to the back to
the real problems here at home.

842
00:47:39,777 --> 00:47:43,150
Although the best way of
to worsen him is to give him/her the back.

843
00:47:43,584 --> 00:47:45,925
If, who would say it,
Does America need to make but?

844
00:47:46,189 --> 00:47:47,976
- We need it.
- Why?

845
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:49,539
Because if.

846
00:47:52,342 --> 00:47:54,718
As getting lost your first
year of secondary.

847
00:47:56,055 --> 00:47:58,396
There are three options in
time of going to the school.

848
00:47:58,496 --> 00:48:00,025
One year in with body
of peace in the exterior.

849
00:48:00,188 --> 00:48:03,440
One year here in one of those
500 places but poor.

850
00:48:03,704 --> 00:48:07,023
Or a scholarship T.C. of learning
here or in the exterior.

851
00:48:07,221 --> 00:48:10,182
All choose one and nobody
it sends him/her a note to he/she suckles.

852
00:48:10,379 --> 00:48:14,153
- Is this a joke?
- Is it maybe it the democracy?

853
00:48:14,579 --> 00:48:16,032
And the civil rights?

854
00:48:16,238 --> 00:48:19,813
And the children that learn to
to go, and do the neighbors invade?

855
00:48:21,187 --> 00:48:22,642
We would get lost in the road.

856
00:48:23,532 --> 00:48:27,073
73% of those of
first year of California,

857
00:48:27,243 --> 00:48:29,285
 ... they don't know the name of the country
that this next to Minessota.

858
00:48:29,489 --> 00:48:30,454
Can you make it?

859
00:48:30,596 --> 00:48:33,028
77% of all the
of first year of the country,

860
00:48:33,202 --> 00:48:35,144
 ... they cannot name those
neighboring states of where they live.

861
00:48:35,350 --> 00:48:39,734
And 50% of all those of grade TO,
they don't write they don't add like they would should.

862
00:48:39,973 --> 00:48:42,870
And when 25% of our
industries didn't work,

863
00:48:43,099 --> 00:48:44,329
 ... we call him/her the great depression.

864
00:48:44,531 --> 00:48:46,807
Then as we call at the 50 %
of our students that don't know?

865
00:48:47,169 --> 00:48:48,567
A depression but big.

866
00:48:49,935 --> 00:48:51,755
Or that Canada this beside Minessota?

867
00:48:53,029 --> 00:48:54,581
That is it but intelligent
that they said in the whole day.

868
00:48:56,447 --> 00:48:57,611
And how's it going with the cause?

869
00:48:57,813 --> 00:48:59,756
But it is very ridiculous and
almost impossible of making it.

870
00:49:00,061 --> 00:49:02,791
Not as much as we spend
in students a year.

871
00:49:03,023 --> 00:49:06,532
9000 for 3.8 millions
of new students,

872
00:49:06,736 --> 00:49:08,067
 ... those they are 34 thousand million dollars.

873
00:49:08,492 --> 00:49:11,513
We spend 2 millions now but that
what we have spent for two years.

874
00:49:12,009 --> 00:49:13,041
And it stops worse.

875
00:49:13,245 --> 00:49:15,621
Who didn't want to be in a
place where there was not a career,

876
00:49:15,982 --> 00:49:18,356
 ... for a wealth, neither
though where you come.

877
00:49:18,650 --> 00:49:20,571
Common alone because we are American.

878
00:49:20,995 --> 00:49:23,103
I guarantee them that that us
he/she would make better in the life.

879
00:49:23,826 --> 00:49:26,236
And it is a pain that not
we have that opportunity,

880
00:49:26,725 --> 00:49:29,644
 ... not in this country, to not
to be that there is a service.

881
00:49:33,464 --> 00:49:36,483
Then he/she would have to be
in the school one year but?

882
00:49:37,078 --> 00:49:38,532
You have been here for 8 years.

883
00:49:41,083 --> 00:49:43,424
They can take all the
titles and the money,

884
00:49:44,110 --> 00:49:46,485
 ... and to hide in one
great house with big walls.

885
00:49:46,942 --> 00:49:49,285
But the house with the walls
high the American dream was not?

886
00:49:51,727 --> 00:49:54,005
July 5 1776.

887
00:49:54,855 --> 00:49:56,929
How's it going December 8 1941?

888
00:49:57,556 --> 00:49:59,477
September 12 2001.

889
00:50:00,649 --> 00:50:03,868
Then both don't want to go to
a company after graduating?

890
00:50:04,263 --> 00:50:06,638
Not they want to make money, that is lie.

891
00:50:06,998 --> 00:50:10,447
I believe that it is a hypocrisy
that they follow all that.

892
00:50:21,257 --> 00:50:21,968
What?

893
00:50:29,299 --> 00:50:30,564
Are they joking?

894
00:50:31,121 --> 00:50:34,663
Order to report for
military instructions.

895
00:50:45,413 --> 00:50:47,757
What does it happen, does it seem as that he/she has it ulcerates?

896
00:50:48,541 --> 00:50:51,339
Because I have them, the question
it is if they are not bleeding.

897
00:50:51,633 --> 00:50:54,496
He/she should stop to think that that
project made us to report ourselves.

898
00:50:54,693 --> 00:50:55,859
- Not it was that.
- I don't believe it.

899
00:50:56,256 --> 00:50:59,408
We go, they can choose any
school in the field that you/they want.

900
00:50:59,675 --> 00:51:01,718
200 thousand dollars until
the day that you graduate.

901
00:51:02,019 --> 00:51:03,184
The program of pardon.

902
00:51:03,387 --> 00:51:06,052
If that, but he/she doesn't forgive
as much as they say.

903
00:51:07,815 --> 00:51:09,733
Aarón this speaking
too much for both.

904
00:51:09,928 --> 00:51:11,784
Does he/she believe that I take out the alone bills?

905
00:51:12,665 --> 00:51:15,721
You were who told us that
we didn't live in a lie.

906
00:51:15,889 --> 00:51:18,618
Not I thought that that those
he/she would make go to the war.

907
00:51:19,013 --> 00:51:20,989
If he/she had known it, me
it had cut the language.

908
00:51:21,163 --> 00:51:22,072
I believe that he/she doesn't understand.

909
00:51:22,465 --> 00:51:25,451
Because I don't see to the I exercise as
something better than a school,

910
00:51:25,851 --> 00:51:27,439
 ... that most of those
students, would kill to enter.

911
00:51:27,707 --> 00:51:29,750
No, because you don't go that
if we made another thing,

912
00:51:30,051 --> 00:51:33,368
 ... we would not be part of him
but important that happens now.

913
00:51:33,891 --> 00:51:35,901
This will define our life.

914
00:51:35,943 --> 00:51:37,984
The same thing that made Vietnam for you.

915
00:51:39,915 --> 00:51:42,345
Not last, they took out me.

916
00:51:45,418 --> 00:51:49,092
In the first world war those
German soldiers were peons,

917
00:51:49,389 --> 00:51:53,452
 ... they feared the Englishmen for its
courage, and it doesn't care them to make fun,

918
00:51:53,655 --> 00:51:56,573
 ... of the English high control, you
they lost but of 100 thousand lives.

919
00:51:58,113 --> 00:52:03,085
A German soldier wrote that
he/she had never seen such soldiers.

920
00:52:04,659 --> 00:52:07,093
That is so effective now.

921
00:52:07,588 --> 00:52:09,410
The stars and the colors
that they began the war.

922
00:52:09,446 --> 00:52:14,649
Not they are neither the best, neither those but
intelligent, neither in the galaxy.

923
00:52:14,946 --> 00:52:18,033
They are those that when one of
our men fly in piece,

924
00:52:18,170 --> 00:52:23,111
 ... they say as, the enemy us full with
bleed, but we learn of the errors.

925
00:52:23,509 --> 00:52:25,363
Well, which problem is it?

926
00:52:25,950 --> 00:52:27,800
If, which, that you speak?

927
00:52:28,783 --> 00:52:31,902
- We know like it works.
- Think, think.

928
00:52:31,941 --> 00:52:33,306
We already made it.

929
00:52:33,373 --> 00:52:35,549
If this goes bad he/she makes it but important.

930
00:52:37,965 --> 00:52:39,330
No... 

931
00:52:39,821 --> 00:52:40,819
What do they mean?

932
00:52:41,805 --> 00:52:43,625
Not 3 weeks we would happen in
the school without the war.

933
00:52:43,661 --> 00:52:46,846
If we kill Bin Laden or to Iraqis.

934
00:52:47,242 --> 00:52:49,030
That is a parade.

935
00:52:49,099 --> 00:52:51,173
Not we have to think of the one who you/they are.

936
00:52:51,247 --> 00:52:53,944
Because the alone religion
he/she requests them murders.

937
00:52:54,015 --> 00:52:56,912
They need a dictator
that it prevents them to make that?

938
00:52:56,946 --> 00:52:59,963
He exercises but big of the
history cannot catch to 3 types.

939
00:53:00,004 --> 00:53:02,215
And like democracy languages,

940
00:53:02,252 --> 00:53:05,536
 ... while you send trillions
to the Kingdom of Saudi.

941
00:53:05,572 --> 00:53:07,093
Where they are killed.

942
00:53:07,135 --> 00:53:08,987
Did they recruit them, not?

943
00:53:09,055 --> 00:53:10,421
We will sit down in a bank.

944
00:53:10,717 --> 00:53:13,734
Those that alante goes, are those that
they work when it is necessary to make it.

945
00:53:13,775 --> 00:53:16,763
He/she would stop when it is necessary
or he/she would throw it stops behind.

946
00:53:16,805 --> 00:53:19,302
And to let that others make their work.

947
00:53:19,344 --> 00:53:20,776
It is an easy question.

948
00:53:20,809 --> 00:53:23,705
They are very ugly answers, trust my.

949
00:53:23,738 --> 00:53:27,090
If he/she thought that this fight deserves it.

950
00:53:27,124 --> 00:53:29,622
I would support it, he/she would make it.

951
00:53:29,664 --> 00:53:31,806
But for that are fighting here?

952
00:53:31,846 --> 00:53:33,366
To change the politics in the house.

953
00:53:33,408 --> 00:53:36,240
We will make this first and
then we will go to the school.

954
00:53:36,306 --> 00:53:37,503
In the time of the I exercise.

955
00:53:37,575 --> 00:53:38,839
Then we will be able to make something.

956
00:53:38,876 --> 00:53:40,821
The unit of Mexican combat.

957
00:53:40,897 --> 00:53:42,817
To educate us, for heaven's sake.

958
00:53:42,850 --> 00:53:46,746
Any debt that ties us
to that we will make later.

959
00:53:46,789 --> 00:53:49,709
Then they will have us that
to listen, we can change things.

960
00:53:52,746 --> 00:53:54,434
If... 

961
00:53:56,946 --> 00:53:59,611
If... 

962
00:54:29,601 --> 00:54:31,221
How this the intelligence
of Russia to finish it?

963
00:54:31,716 --> 00:54:33,605
It is better to capture him that to kill him.

964
00:54:37,611 --> 00:54:39,553
When it arrives there, shoot direct.

965
00:54:40,019 --> 00:54:41,773
I want him to approach to the rescue.

966
00:54:42,072 --> 00:54:45,322
We have a bombardier
paw to try to clean it.

967
00:54:45,781 --> 00:54:48,246
But there are still explosive in the area.

968
00:54:49,624 --> 00:54:52,159
I want to be for sure this
this well in the control chain.

969
00:54:52,293 --> 00:54:53,354
Am I you clear?

970
00:54:53,531 --> 00:54:56,061
He/she tells him/her that this is not so
easy as you leave to 9000 miles.

971
00:54:59,423 --> 00:55:02,743
I sit down to make you wait,
there was a voting... 

972
00:55:03,102 --> 00:55:07,399
In 1991 my chain was bought,

973
00:55:07,433 --> 00:55:11,140
 ... for a corporation but well-known
to sell soap and bulbs.

974
00:55:12,187 --> 00:55:14,560
And in one night we become
in an organization of news.

975
00:55:14,627 --> 00:55:17,458
Worried by news,
to a news unit.

976
00:55:17,494 --> 00:55:20,479
Concerned with answers and the ratings.

977
00:55:21,596 --> 00:55:24,225
A shit, and the wise thing.

978
00:55:24,296 --> 00:55:27,449
When I saw my contract, wise that that
he/she wanted and I planned to be able to have autonomy.

979
00:55:27,519 --> 00:55:30,285
I thought that they were still committed,

980
00:55:31,330 --> 00:55:33,370
 ... to the news but... 

981
00:55:33,673 --> 00:55:36,016
Janine, please sit down.

982
00:55:44,548 --> 00:55:45,979
Thank you to say that.

983
00:55:46,663 --> 00:55:48,062
It is the true.

984
00:55:48,648 --> 00:55:50,203
How I can... 

985
00:55:50,993 --> 00:55:53,623
 ... to verify those
results of this mission?

986
00:55:53,662 --> 00:55:55,385
Not it will involve to the press in this?
- No!

987
00:55:55,421 --> 00:55:58,898
Not it will be this way, the forces
special they travel quick.

988
00:55:59,296 --> 00:56:01,531
But I can give him/her the infrared video.

989
00:56:01,641 --> 00:56:04,270
That this well, they are very
popular in the Internet.

990
00:56:04,505 --> 00:56:06,646
And the details you those
I will give directly me.

991
00:56:07,141 --> 00:56:09,940
Thank you, allow me to put an end to the courtesy.

992
00:56:10,170 --> 00:56:11,601
You, really?

993
00:56:11,797 --> 00:56:13,095
In the worst in the cases.

994
00:56:14,143 --> 00:56:15,730
The operation points don't work.

995
00:56:15,802 --> 00:56:16,999
They worked.

996
00:56:17,071 --> 00:56:22,377
The president or you
did he/she think of increasing the troops?

997
00:56:22,442 --> 00:56:24,975
To support the strategy
if it is necessary.

998
00:56:25,081 --> 00:56:28,489
The reputation of the I exercise
this very low one now.

999
00:56:28,533 --> 00:56:31,329
Maybe he/she will have to send to those
boys that didn't sign to go.

1000
00:56:32,014 --> 00:56:33,958
Military obligatory service?
No, we don't need it.

1001
00:56:34,294 --> 00:56:36,436
We have all that that
we need to enter now.

1002
00:56:36,507 --> 00:56:38,451
Except that the public doesn't make it.

1003
00:56:38,495 --> 00:56:40,992
There it is where your you enter.

1004
00:56:42,467 --> 00:56:44,931
But like we know that
will it leave well well this?

1005
00:56:45,005 --> 00:56:47,080
People don't trust.

1006
00:56:47,121 --> 00:56:50,173
After September 11
we had to the world on our behalf.

1007
00:56:50,214 --> 00:56:53,923
And now 6 years later, we are in one
of the worst moments in the history.

1008
00:56:53,959 --> 00:56:56,200
We go, the exaggeration won't make... 

1009
00:56:56,269 --> 00:56:58,901
We go, nobody this monitoreando
our patriotism.

1010
00:56:58,940 --> 00:57:02,448
You have to admit that this it is
one of the moments but difficult,

1011
00:57:02,521 --> 00:57:05,118
 ... to wave our
flag, people need... 

1012
00:57:05,158 --> 00:57:08,966
A victory, people,
the president, me.

1013
00:57:08,999 --> 00:57:12,319
We all need to win in Afghanistan.

1014
00:57:12,387 --> 00:57:14,850
To win him/her will allow to the one
public that concentrates.

1015
00:57:14,925 --> 00:57:18,367
To win will make that the congress
speak again instead of screaming.

1016
00:57:18,442 --> 00:57:19,895
I will tell to people in Afghanistan.

1017
00:57:19,939 --> 00:57:21,005
That cannot be known.

1018
00:57:21,079 --> 00:57:22,598
And he/she helps to their party.

1019
00:57:22,641 --> 00:57:25,271
Because we have a party
that it represents the security.

1020
00:57:25,310 --> 00:57:27,452
The power of this country you
he/she knows as the party that,

1021
00:57:27,524 --> 00:57:32,432
 ... it demonstrates that we are capable
of finishing our fight.

1022
00:57:32,507 --> 00:57:35,236
- To finish?
- Do you want to win?

1023
00:57:36,739 --> 00:57:38,592
- What?
- Do you want to win the war against the terror?

1024
00:57:39,146 --> 00:57:42,100
If or not? If or not?

1025
00:57:42,468 --> 00:57:44,020
It is very wide... 

1026
00:57:44,159 --> 00:57:46,503
It is the question that guides us.

1027
00:57:46,896 --> 00:57:49,660
It is definitive, if you stop you will die.

1028
00:57:50,055 --> 00:57:51,874
The only option for United States... 

1029
00:57:52,105 --> 00:57:53,535
It excuses.

1030
00:58:24,239 --> 00:58:25,671
When?

1031
00:58:27,429 --> 00:58:29,184
Ammunition.

1032
00:59:03,079 --> 00:59:04,145
All they have left ammunition?

1033
00:59:04,284 --> 00:59:05,648
How could he/she know?

1034
00:59:07,507 --> 00:59:09,427
I believe that they want that they enter to their area.

1035
00:59:13,465 --> 00:59:14,984
Stay informed.

1036
00:59:20,659 --> 00:59:22,836
Alone you cover me, he/she takes care of your ammunition.

1037
00:59:38,827 --> 00:59:40,224
I will tell you of what I get tired... 

1038
00:59:40,291 --> 00:59:42,854
Let us get tired that they humiliate me.

1039
00:59:43,677 --> 00:59:46,863
We have allowed that
threaten to our country,

1040
00:59:47,064 --> 00:59:50,117
 ... for these tribes in taparrabos.

1041
00:59:51,785 --> 00:59:53,405
And he/she will end.

1042
00:59:57,156 --> 00:59:58,386
Do you realize what we have?

1043
00:59:59,891 --> 01:00:01,812
Of what we are capable?

1044
01:00:05,719 --> 01:00:07,172
God knows... 

1045
01:00:10,634 --> 01:00:14,499
I break the heart
to request to the soldiers,

1046
01:00:14,706 --> 01:00:17,235
 ... that they take a risk its
life for this victory.

1047
01:00:18,416 --> 01:00:20,359
But you that there is not another form.

1048
01:00:21,443 --> 01:00:24,174
Not with this enemy,
not with their beliefs.

1049
01:00:28,672 --> 01:00:31,401
But alone I can give them to
the families of the soldiers,

1050
01:00:33,359 --> 01:00:34,946
 ... the absolute conviction.

1051
01:00:37,167 --> 01:00:39,309
That at least we attempt it.

1052
01:00:49,410 --> 01:00:52,628
Now, I don't see none
transaction, I don't see it.

1053
01:00:53,220 --> 01:00:54,385
That is the question.

1054
01:00:55,368 --> 01:00:57,221
My notes please?

1055
01:01:00,934 --> 01:01:02,390
Is this your strategy?

1056
01:01:03,311 --> 01:01:05,231
It is him/her product of a new one
school of military thought.

1057
01:01:05,427 --> 01:01:06,592
And your you are the new school.

1058
01:01:06,795 --> 01:01:09,227
The president listens to you but
that to the defense secretary.

1059
01:01:09,432 --> 01:01:10,341
Then?

1060
01:01:10,702 --> 01:01:12,590
If he/she is successful, you put him/her your name,

1061
01:01:12,787 --> 01:01:15,094
 ... it is a good form
of leaving the bundle.

1062
01:01:15,130 --> 01:01:17,139
and their party him
he/she wanted as president.

1063
01:01:18,646 --> 01:01:23,097
I believe that you make a mistake,
I don't want to be a president.

1064
01:01:27,436 --> 01:01:31,210
This can help, it is one
great history, and it is yours.

1065
01:01:32,092 --> 01:01:34,755
This is my direct telephone,
you call me if you have questions.

1066
01:01:35,152 --> 01:01:36,584
Thank you.

1067
01:02:15,685 --> 01:02:18,703
As it is necessary.

1068
01:02:54,102 --> 01:02:55,268
Do you have idea of how many they are?

1069
01:02:55,569 --> 01:02:57,121
A dozen maybe.

1070
01:02:57,423 --> 01:03:00,153
Tell to the bombardier that continues
shooting until he/she is not able to but.

1071
01:03:00,191 --> 01:03:02,111
The rescue team this to 6 minutes.

1072
01:03:04,457 --> 01:03:05,942
We will return later.

1073
01:03:14,255 --> 01:03:15,808
Can they see each other?

1074
01:03:31,707 --> 01:03:33,160
Why did they leave?

1075
01:03:34,049 --> 01:03:35,570
Not you.

1076
01:03:44,143 --> 01:03:46,485
Then he/she wants him to make
one of their projects.

1077
01:03:47,365 --> 01:03:49,053
Although I sound as
a fairy tale.

1078
01:03:50,523 --> 01:03:52,566
- Did he/she give them one TO for that reason?
- I gave them a B+.

1079
01:03:53,063 --> 01:03:55,071
- What?
- A B+, bad statistical.

1080
01:03:55,276 --> 01:03:57,874
If, I listen to it, why not me
does he/she speak of those that had one TO?

1081
01:03:57,914 --> 01:04:03,243
Then the attendance is
but important that the notes?

1082
01:04:03,286 --> 01:04:05,950
You already know the secret.

1083
01:04:06,021 --> 01:04:10,994
He/she calls himself potential and believe me
that it is better than having one TO.

1084
01:04:11,034 --> 01:04:13,564
Of the one that you forgot in some years.

1085
01:04:13,638 --> 01:04:15,615
That sounds to what you/they say
the mediocre ones for... 

1086
01:04:15,690 --> 01:04:18,709
No, that is pretty, but anything.

1087
01:04:18,750 --> 01:04:21,902
Maybe both had medals.

1088
01:04:21,940 --> 01:04:23,528
Not to leave it.

1089
01:04:25,262 --> 01:04:26,560
Your the mándaste there?

1090
01:04:27,150 --> 01:04:30,270
I already told it to you, be about stopping them.

1091
01:04:30,341 --> 01:04:31,895
Revealing the reasons
for those that made it.

1092
01:04:31,937 --> 01:04:36,132
I should listen to it, for
this address that gives me.

1093
01:04:36,169 --> 01:04:38,210
Although the two of those that he/she speaks to me.

1094
01:04:38,284 --> 01:04:42,024
They didn't listen to him/her and they were and
they made what you/they will make.

1095
01:04:43,754 --> 01:04:47,816
Maybe, maybe this throwing the load.

1096
01:04:47,856 --> 01:04:52,672
Because, how common he/she finds to
a student that is worthwhile?

1097
01:04:52,739 --> 01:04:57,390
and how often flaw in convincing him?

1098
01:04:57,428 --> 01:04:59,804
Once he/she found it.

1099
01:04:59,870 --> 01:05:04,842
In fact the failure
it began 10 or 15 years ago.

1100
01:05:04,883 --> 01:05:10,156
The truth is that taenia
these meetings in the park.

1101
01:05:10,223 --> 01:05:14,119
Your, seated students in front of my.

1102
01:05:14,162 --> 01:05:16,404
Because we are but intelligent,
we see like everything works.

1103
01:05:16,473 --> 01:05:19,004
Not we want to die for this shit.

1104
01:05:19,045 --> 01:05:22,097
If you want to distance yourself of the one
real world as it is possible.

1105
01:05:22,138 --> 01:05:24,970
And these shits, by the way
how many times you will say it.

1106
01:05:25,005 --> 01:05:28,779
They feed of your
apathy, of your ignorance.

1107
01:05:29,952 --> 01:05:31,605
They plan strategies with that.

1108
01:05:32,297 --> 01:05:34,017
They think like they can achieve with that.

1109
01:05:34,282 --> 01:05:35,768
Then accuse me.

1110
01:05:35,844 --> 01:05:38,378
Accuse me because I want
to live a good life.

1111
01:05:38,419 --> 01:05:40,426
Because I can and because I am intelligent.

1112
01:05:41,249 --> 01:05:44,690
You want to accuse me because
don't I want to work with you?

1113
01:05:44,732 --> 01:05:46,132
In a collective bottom.

1114
01:05:46,198 --> 01:05:48,861
It sounds too much as my parents.

1115
01:05:48,932 --> 01:05:52,020
They always speak of as giving me one
life better than which you/they had.

1116
01:05:52,059 --> 01:05:55,344
And be they torment for that enjoy it.

1117
01:05:55,380 --> 01:05:58,498
Is a check of 90 thousand dollars how well?

1118
01:05:59,871 --> 01:06:03,479
Not there is enough gasoline
for the streets and the cities.

1119
01:06:04,072 --> 01:06:06,148
Or the fact of investing us
in a third world.

1120
01:06:06,546 --> 01:06:09,143
If all that you say of the one
congress and the politics.

1121
01:06:10,909 --> 01:06:13,739
If the things are as bad as they say.

1122
01:06:14,359 --> 01:06:16,956
Then thousands of American
they are dead and but they die,

1123
01:06:17,094 --> 01:06:18,259
 ... maybe while we speak.

1124
01:06:18,331 --> 01:06:20,375
Say I eat up you can
to enjoy the good life.

1125
01:06:22,173 --> 01:06:23,793
Rome this in flames.

1126
01:06:24,224 --> 01:06:26,723
And the problem is not who began him.

1127
01:06:26,959 --> 01:06:29,167
They already left, the one
problem is us, all.

1128
01:06:30,247 --> 01:06:34,601
That we don't make anything that
we are about avoiding the bad thing.

1129
01:06:35,067 --> 01:06:37,830
And there are there out in the entire world people.

1130
01:06:38,126 --> 01:06:39,747
That they fight so that everything is better.

1131
01:06:39,787 --> 01:06:42,118
He/she believes that it is better to fail
attempting it that to try to fail?

1132
01:06:42,271 --> 01:06:42,512
If.

1133
01:06:42,684 --> 01:06:45,025
But which is the difference
if you finish in the same place?

1134
01:06:50,336 --> 01:06:52,155
It guides you to something.

1135
01:07:07,329 --> 01:07:08,495
Thank you to play.

1136
01:07:10,325 --> 01:07:12,367
A single time, one hour.

1137
01:07:12,767 --> 01:07:14,422
One hour, God, is one
series or a history.

1138
01:07:14,720 --> 01:07:16,606
On a new movement of the I exercise.

1139
01:07:16,868 --> 01:07:18,267
While we are seated.

1140
01:07:18,562 --> 01:07:22,840
A sole right? Well, details,
let us give the basic thing in the line.

1141
01:07:23,904 --> 01:07:24,602
Which is the action?

1142
01:07:26,891 --> 01:07:28,151
Janine...  Hello!

1143
01:07:28,492 --> 01:07:31,256
It is a shit, not one is not able to... 

1144
01:07:31,877 --> 01:07:34,863
I have a bad premonition, he/she feels.

1145
01:07:35,264 --> 01:07:37,307
- ?
- Hole.

1146
01:07:37,803 --> 01:07:39,258
- Does he/she feel?
- If.

1147
01:07:39,465 --> 01:07:41,017
I pay you to investigate
your feelings?

1148
01:07:41,222 --> 01:07:42,454
Alone you give me the data.

1149
01:07:42,492 --> 01:07:44,379
Not we can make this again.

1150
01:07:44,445 --> 01:07:47,497
Not we can believe ourselves the program.

1151
01:07:48,092 --> 01:07:50,465
As we made the other time... 

1152
01:07:50,499 --> 01:07:53,486
He/she waits, while my head, explodes.

1153
01:07:53,920 --> 01:07:56,161
- Is this your type, not?
- Not it is my type... 

1154
01:07:56,197 --> 01:08:00,126
He/she came to you, he/she gave you one
sole right, is a gift.

1155
01:08:00,169 --> 01:08:02,279
Not it is a gift, it is propaganda.

1156
01:08:02,352 --> 01:08:05,014
And we don't have to transmit
all that the government wants.

1157
01:08:05,052 --> 01:08:06,941
No, we transmit news.

1158
01:08:07,528 --> 01:08:09,347
A military great movement is news.

1159
01:08:10,327 --> 01:08:12,602
Do you have an attack of conscience?

1160
01:08:12,671 --> 01:08:14,392
- Please.
- Not it is late for that?

1161
01:08:14,430 --> 01:08:16,861
We go, which the history is,
who the informant is?

1162
01:08:16,905 --> 01:08:19,013
Your you are big to remember who.

1163
01:08:20,420 --> 01:08:21,940
- Who.
- Not he/she wanted to listen to it.

1164
01:08:21,983 --> 01:08:23,992
- And what?
- The new boss.

1165
01:08:24,197 --> 01:08:27,027
The same one that the old one,
the same of Vietnam.

1166
01:08:27,061 --> 01:08:30,636
You will send small new platoons.

1167
01:08:30,676 --> 01:08:33,628
Children like bait, it is the same thing... 

1168
01:08:33,670 --> 01:08:36,923
That is a speculation,
we don't transmit that... 

1169
01:08:36,959 --> 01:08:41,255
If him you, is that they are so
despaired by an escape road.

1170
01:08:41,289 --> 01:08:43,497
So desperate for
to change the topic of Iraq.

1171
01:08:43,534 --> 01:08:47,631
They are desirous of winning
that they listen Irving.

1172
01:08:47,670 --> 01:08:49,258
And you know, I don't accuse them.

1173
01:08:49,298 --> 01:08:51,639
Because the one is good,
but the one doesn't have a plan,

1174
01:08:51,675 --> 01:08:54,017
 ... for the day after the attack, not.

1175
01:08:54,052 --> 01:08:58,602
This speaking of heart and mind
and everything is helicopters and soldiers.

1176
01:08:58,674 --> 01:09:02,738
Jesús, in all ways
you don't care that.

1177
01:09:02,777 --> 01:09:07,228
The whole strategy, is
a lubricant one for... 

1178
01:09:07,269 --> 01:09:09,124
 ... that the he/she puts on in the White House.

1179
01:09:09,321 --> 01:09:10,685
And what, is the one ambitious?

1180
01:09:10,720 --> 01:09:12,308
What?

1181
01:09:12,348 --> 01:09:15,568
These leaving that the
doesn't politics allow you to think?

1182
01:09:15,670 --> 01:09:17,034
Alone it is about making the work.

1183
01:09:17,069 --> 01:09:19,966
Your work if I can you
to bring from turn to this time.

1184
01:09:20,260 --> 01:09:22,146
It is to report the data
verified, to transmit them.

1185
01:09:22,212 --> 01:09:23,311
Not there is none, ok.

1186
01:09:23,352 --> 01:09:26,215
Not there are tests, alone
we have to take their word.

1187
01:09:26,250 --> 01:09:28,594
It is too hot here.

1188
01:09:33,055 --> 01:09:34,486
I will tell you something.

1189
01:09:34,520 --> 01:09:36,462
He has a plan for
after the elections.

1190
01:09:36,505 --> 01:09:38,648
And it is not a slow process.

1191
01:09:38,688 --> 01:09:41,907
No, these boys have toys,

1192
01:09:41,976 --> 01:09:44,606
 ... that they have not been able to use.

1193
01:09:44,645 --> 01:09:47,998
Let us get tired that you humble, he/she says.

1194
01:09:48,031 --> 01:09:50,727
They are crazy to knock down this.

1195
01:09:50,766 --> 01:09:52,031
Not I want that shit... 

1196
01:09:52,067 --> 01:09:53,588
You will already know what is news.

1197
01:09:53,631 --> 01:09:55,607
He told it to me, I have it... 

1198
01:09:55,650 --> 01:09:58,079
What is to win.

1199
01:09:59,881 --> 01:10:01,923
here this aim, what is.

1200
01:10:01,997 --> 01:10:04,561
Please calm down.

1201
01:10:11,081 --> 01:10:15,598
I find it to my that Irving has a
plan to go after those that attacked us.

1202
01:10:17,820 --> 01:10:20,194
People will believe that you/he/she is
a good thing, me also.

1203
01:10:23,127 --> 01:10:24,291
What do I happen to you?

1204
01:10:26,547 --> 01:10:28,887
You received a blow from somebody
if you believed that it was justified.

1205
01:10:29,866 --> 01:10:31,454
You were of the good ones.

1206
01:10:34,263 --> 01:10:36,338
I believe that neither it would arrive at the 40.

1207
01:10:37,387 --> 01:10:39,363
- We go.
- Not you can leave me.

1208
01:10:40,740 --> 01:10:42,492
Not you can make it.

1209
01:10:42,856 --> 01:10:44,409
This mistaken one, I cannot make this.

1210
01:10:44,712 --> 01:10:47,698
These creating a history
speculative, based in that.

1211
01:10:49,108 --> 01:10:50,628
Woman's intuition?

1212
01:10:51,386 --> 01:10:52,751
He/she waited but of you.

1213
01:10:53,014 --> 01:10:55,257
If you waited that he/she made that.

1214
01:10:55,521 --> 01:10:58,318
If we don't make it who will make it.

1215
01:10:59,557 --> 01:11:01,932
This is the work, these politicians.

1216
01:11:02,130 --> 01:11:04,538
The newspapers that you/they say
that if he/she had known it,

1217
01:11:04,800 --> 01:11:07,262
 ... that that you now,
it is lie, it is lie.

1218
01:11:07,665 --> 01:11:11,471
Everything was there, and we ignore it.

1219
01:11:11,766 --> 01:11:14,632
If there were us
position for that, but not.

1220
01:11:15,902 --> 01:11:18,111
Alone we turn ourselves.

1221
01:11:20,167 --> 01:11:21,531
What does it happen if you make a mistake?

1222
01:11:23,520 --> 01:11:26,771
Listen to me you have 57
years, you have a mother,

1223
01:11:27,068 --> 01:11:28,623
 ... that he/she needs care 24 hours a day.

1224
01:11:29,282 --> 01:11:31,814
What company you
did it hire after this?

1225
01:11:35,435 --> 01:11:38,355
- Alone I request you.
- Don't request it to me.

1226
01:11:39,374 --> 01:11:42,361
Your version of the history
it was never published, you know it.

1227
01:11:46,863 --> 01:11:48,452
Not I can write the one that gave me.

1228
01:11:49,826 --> 01:11:51,835
Not I can.

1229
01:11:59,790 --> 01:12:03,360
Well, I believe that you should think it.

1230
01:13:09,917 --> 01:13:12,835
It happens over there, and it kills to the talibanes.

1231
01:13:21,865 --> 01:13:24,108
Look at the poster.

1232
01:13:25,803 --> 01:13:28,399
Does he/she wait, do we finish?

1233
01:13:29,776 --> 01:13:33,584
Of agreement, this it is the end.

1234
01:13:35,343 --> 01:13:36,896
So we go with me.

1235
01:13:38,761 --> 01:13:41,779
The decisions that you make
now they cannot be changed.

1236
01:13:42,180 --> 01:13:44,156
Not without years of work to change them.

1237
01:13:45,891 --> 01:13:47,479
And in those years you
you transform into something different.

1238
01:13:49,440 --> 01:13:52,625
All they make it, you marry, you have debts.

1239
01:13:54,192 --> 01:13:56,235
But you will never be what you are now.

1240
01:13:57,840 --> 01:14:03,467
The promise, potential, is very fleeting.

1241
01:14:05,913 --> 01:14:07,767
And maybe not this there forever.

1242
01:14:13,142 --> 01:14:14,795
He/she thinks that he/she already makes a decision.

1243
01:14:16,267 --> 01:14:17,954
And that I will be sorry.

1244
01:14:19,099 --> 01:14:20,497
What I say is that you are an adult.

1245
01:14:22,550 --> 01:14:24,304
And the difficult thing of that is... 

1246
01:14:26,686 --> 01:14:28,693
 ... it begins before you realize.

1247
01:14:30,365 --> 01:14:32,251
When you have already made many decisions.

1248
01:14:33,488 --> 01:14:35,143
What you have to know,

1249
01:14:36,809 --> 01:14:39,152
 ... nobody already takes care,
these for your bill.

1250
01:14:40,326 --> 01:14:44,623
You are a man and the decisions that
take they are yours until the end.

1251
01:14:46,674 --> 01:14:49,438
I sit down it, there he/she says
until the 8 and step a lot.

1252
01:14:49,898 --> 01:14:51,352
If, I sit down it.

1253
01:14:51,950 --> 01:14:53,314
Not I want to know my decision.

1254
01:14:53,609 --> 01:14:56,562
The class is on Tuesday to
the 9, I will find out then.

1255
01:15:09,334 --> 01:15:10,988
He/she closes the door.

1256
01:15:23,432 --> 01:15:25,085
- Ammunition?
- No.

1257
01:15:30,951 --> 01:15:32,607
Me neither.

1258
01:15:37,497 --> 01:15:38,984
They didn't rescue us on time.

1259
01:15:43,975 --> 01:15:45,629
No.

1260
01:15:52,764 --> 01:15:54,775
Veto of here, veto.

1261
01:15:56,574 --> 01:15:57,940
I won't make it.

1262
01:15:59,472 --> 01:16:01,225
You can move, veto.

1263
01:16:01,752 --> 01:16:03,271
I won't make it.

1264
01:16:15,392 --> 01:16:19,255
Not this way, I didn't seize.

1265
01:16:30,271 --> 01:16:31,669
Help me.

1266
01:16:35,284 --> 01:16:37,004
Help me.

1267
01:19:24,287 --> 01:19:25,452
Do you go to the party today?

1268
01:19:26,370 --> 01:19:29,356
If, JD, this organizing one.

1269
01:19:35,422 --> 01:19:37,364
What are you lifted so early?

1270
01:19:38,937 --> 01:19:41,079
A meeting with Mally.

1271
01:20:06,287 --> 01:20:08,234
Of what did they speak?

1272
01:20:10,941 --> 01:20:12,660
The notes.

1273
01:20:12,700 --> 01:20:15,040
FBI announces new mission.

1274
01:20:15,143 --> 01:20:16,703
You this managing?

1275
01:20:19,993 --> 01:20:21,066
Him this making, not?

1276
01:20:21,263 --> 01:20:22,334
No, not him this making.

1277
01:20:22,630 --> 01:20:25,750
The American troops
they look for where to battle.

1278
01:20:26,535 --> 01:20:28,778
Do you know what you want?

1279
01:20:34,773 --> 01:20:36,204
Do you know?
