1
00:00:40,206 --> 00:00:45,003
[Ralphie]<i> When you're a kid, all
you want is the perfect Christmas gift.</i>

2
00:00:45,086 --> 00:00:50,425
<i>When you're a parent, all you
want is for Christmas to be perfect.</i>

3
00:00:50,508 --> 00:00:52,969
<i>But sometimes, if we're lucky,</i>

4
00:00:53,052 --> 00:00:56,139
<i>the Yuletide stars
shine full upon us</i>

5
00:00:56,222 --> 00:00:58,224
<i>in a rare moment of truth.</i>

6
00:00:58,308 --> 00:01:04,481
<i>And how we react in these
moments can forever seal our fate.</i>

7
00:01:12,864 --> 00:01:16,409
[Ralphie] <i>Ah, there it
is. Our humble abode</i>

8
00:01:16,493 --> 00:01:18,495
<i>on the south side of the city.</i>

9
00:01:18,578 --> 00:01:20,288
<i>Just like I remember,</i>

10
00:01:20,371 --> 00:01:25,794
<i>in all of its yellow,
orange and avocado-green glory.</i>

11
00:01:25,877 --> 00:01:27,962
<i>Oh, life moves fast.</i>

12
00:01:28,046 --> 00:01:32,217
<i>One day you're playing "kick the can"
with kids named Flick and Schwartz.</i>

13
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:38,056
<i>And the next thing you know, you're
paying taxes and pulling out grey hairs.</i>

14
00:01:38,139 --> 00:01:44,145
<i>But no matter. My sights were
set on a higher purpose.</i>

15
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:47,607
<i>And I was gonna
get there with Sandy</i>

16
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:49,400
<i>by my side.</i>

17
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:53,112
<i>Even though times were lean,</i>

18
00:01:53,196 --> 00:01:55,031
<i>we had everything we needed.</i>

19
00:01:55,114 --> 00:01:58,952
<i>At least that's what we told
our kids, Mark and Julie.</i>

20
00:01:59,035 --> 00:02:02,455
[Julie] Okay, but what if
there's a fire in the fireplace?

21
00:02:02,539 --> 00:02:04,374
Santa is fireproof.

22
00:02:04,457 --> 00:02:06,793
What if the fireplace
is too small?

23
00:02:06,876 --> 00:02:08,378
He sneaks in a window.

24
00:02:08,461 --> 00:02:09,504
Good morning.

25
00:02:09,587 --> 00:02:11,047
- Good morning, Mom.
- Morning.

26
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:12,465
What if the window is stuck?

27
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:14,175
He has WD-40.

28
00:02:14,259 --> 00:02:15,927
- What if the window is too small?
- He sucks in his gut.

29
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:17,470
- Hey. Get your breakfast.
- Okay.

30
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:19,389
[both] Yes, Mom.

31
00:02:19,472 --> 00:02:21,224
[Ralphie]<i> While the kids
counted the days left 'til Christmas,</i>

32
00:02:21,307 --> 00:02:23,893
<i>I was racing against the clock.</i>

33
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:28,022
<i>We had socked away just enough
for one year, so I could write</i>

34
00:02:28,106 --> 00:02:30,483
<i>the next great American novel.</i>

35
00:02:30,567 --> 00:02:34,529
<i>Everyone gets their chance,
and when yours comes along,</i>

36
00:02:34,612 --> 00:02:37,365
<i>you had better grab it.</i>

37
00:02:37,448 --> 00:02:40,368
[laughs]<i> Nothing</i>
<i>could stop me now.</i>

38
00:02:40,451 --> 00:02:42,412
Dad! We're out of milk.

39
00:02:42,495 --> 00:02:46,124
- What?
- My fault, my fault. I forgot to get it.

40
00:02:46,207 --> 00:02:51,880
But have you ever had
the delicacy of cereal with...

41
00:02:54,757 --> 00:02:55,592
orange juice?

42
00:02:55,675 --> 00:02:57,093
- [groans]
- Ew.

43
00:02:57,176 --> 00:02:59,554
Nobody? You are in for a treat.

44
00:02:59,637 --> 00:03:02,307
Nice bowl full of cocoa buds

45
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:06,185
poured with some
delicious OJ. Hm.

46
00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:08,313
And then... [slurps]

47
00:03:08,396 --> 00:03:10,023
[Mark] Ugh. That's disgusting.

48
00:03:10,106 --> 00:03:11,316
- Mm.
- Ew.

49
00:03:12,358 --> 00:03:15,361
Mm. You can't beat that.

50
00:03:15,445 --> 00:03:16,946
There you go, sweetie.

51
00:03:17,906 --> 00:03:19,699
Well, you gonna try it?

52
00:03:19,782 --> 00:03:21,492
- Mom, you go first.
- No.

53
00:03:21,576 --> 00:03:23,536
Dad, when can we
take out the stockings?

54
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:26,080
Let's wait for Grandpa.
He loves that stuff.

55
00:03:26,164 --> 00:03:28,458
Yeah, you guys
can do it together.

56
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:31,210
The angel! She's so beautiful.

57
00:03:31,294 --> 00:03:34,714
It's almost Christmas and we
don't have a tree for our angel.

58
00:03:34,797 --> 00:03:36,299
I know, honey.
We're gonna get a tree

59
00:03:36,382 --> 00:03:39,010
as soon as Grandma and Grandpa
get here. Two more days.

60
00:03:39,093 --> 00:03:41,512
I feel like I've
been waiting forever.

61
00:03:41,596 --> 00:03:44,807
[Ralphie]<i> Every year, my parents
made the long drive to Chicago</i>

62
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:47,727
<i>so we could all celebrate
with a big city Christmas.</i>

63
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:51,648
<i>But until then, I could
stay focused on my dream.</i>

64
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:52,815
Oh...

65
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:54,776
- How do I look?
- Like a writer.

66
00:03:54,859 --> 00:03:56,152
- Hey, kids.
- Good luck.

67
00:03:56,235 --> 00:03:57,570
- Good luck.
- Good luck.

[Ralphie] <i>This was the
deal. I had to be published</i>

77
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:25,640
<i>by the end of this year,</i>

78
00:04:25,723 --> 00:04:30,603
<i>or I'd pack up my dream
and return to the rat race.</i>

79
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:34,524
<i>So, I'd sent my manuscript
to 16 lucky publishers,</i>

80
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:39,862
<i>and 14 of them
enthusiastically said, "No."</i>

81
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:45,201
<i>With the year almost over,
I desperately needed a win.</i>

82
00:04:47,704 --> 00:04:49,455
Mr. Parker...

83
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:54,002
we generally handle this sort of
meeting with a written correspondence,

84
00:04:54,085 --> 00:04:56,713
but your insistence
to meet in person...

85
00:04:56,796 --> 00:04:59,716
Oh. Uh, I brought you
a little something.

86
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:02,510
<i>Greasing the wheels
certainly couldn't hurt.</i>

87
00:05:02,593 --> 00:05:04,137
Marshall Field's.

88
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:05,430
The good stuff.

89
00:05:07,682 --> 00:05:08,808
Is this...

90
00:05:09,934 --> 00:05:11,978
a bribe?

91
00:05:12,061 --> 00:05:13,187
I don't know.

92
00:05:13,938 --> 00:05:15,148
You tell me.

93
00:05:24,574 --> 00:05:25,742
[chuckles]

94
00:05:25,825 --> 00:05:27,910
Your manuscript,
<i>Jupiter's Oblivion...</i>

95
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:30,747
Uh, Neptune.
It's<i> Neptune's Oblivion.</i>

96
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:34,167
Though an interesting title
and thoroughly written,

97
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:37,670
we're not accepting manuscripts
over 2,000 pages.

98
00:05:37,754 --> 00:05:39,422
Oh. Well, I could
cut it down a bit.

99
00:05:39,505 --> 00:05:42,091
You could cut it in half and
there'd still be too many words.

100
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:44,844
Ah, Well, I know
it doesn't feel like it ends,

101
00:05:44,927 --> 00:05:49,265
but that's because it all pays off in
the sequel, which I'm writing right now.

102
00:05:49,348 --> 00:05:51,267
Oh, Lord, not more.

103
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:56,898
This isn't a subject
we're interested in...

104
00:05:56,981 --> 00:05:58,274
- at all.
- No.

105
00:05:58,357 --> 00:06:00,026
This has been
my entire life this past year.

106
00:06:00,109 --> 00:06:01,986
Good day, Mr. Parker.

107
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:03,654
And have a Merry Christmas.

108
00:06:03,738 --> 00:06:05,448
[Ralphie]<i> Merry my foot.</i>

109
00:06:05,531 --> 00:06:08,743
<i>This pencil pusher had no
appreciation for my vision.</i>

110
00:06:08,826 --> 00:06:11,079
<i>Oh, one day he'd see.</i>

111
00:06:11,162 --> 00:06:13,122
<i>They'd all see.</i>

112

[male awards announcer] <i>We're
back, just in time for the main event!</i>

113

for literary achievement
in science fiction writing

115
00:06:22,715 --> 00:06:26,177
over 2,000 pages is...

116
00:06:28,012 --> 00:06:31,849
Mr. Ralph Wesley Parker
for<i> Neptune's Oblivion!</i>

117
00:06:31,933 --> 00:06:35,228
[male awards announcer] <i>What
an upset! We're seeing history, folks!</i>

118
00:06:35,311 --> 00:06:38,481
<i>This is Ralph's
first nomination and first win.</i>

119
00:06:38,564 --> 00:06:41,943
- That's my husband.
<i>- With 100% of the vote.</i>

120
00:06:42,026 --> 00:06:44,904
<i>Even the other contestants
voted for him.</i>

121
00:06:44,987 --> 00:06:47,824
<i>Anyone who doubted him must
be kicking themselves tonight.</i>

122
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:50,910
<i>- And there's one of them now!</i>
- Forgive me, Mr. Parker. I was wrong.

123
00:06:50,993 --> 00:06:52,703
Dead wrong! Please.

124
00:06:52,787 --> 00:06:55,164
- [male awards announcer] <i>What a moron!</i>
- Please.

125
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:59,335
<i>Tonight, we crown
the new voice of a generation.</i>

127
00:07:02,964 --> 00:07:06,008
[crowd chanting] <i>Parker!

128
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:07,635
Mr. Parker.

129
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:09,929
Oh.

130
00:07:10,012 --> 00:07:11,556
I said good day.

131
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:15,560
Oh, right. Good day.

132
00:07:18,813 --> 00:07:21,315
[Sandy] Well, there's still
one publisher left.

133
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:22,859
Yeah.

134
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:24,360
Hey, you know,
I heard that Mark Twain

135
00:07:24,443 --> 00:07:27,280
got rejected 34 times
before he got published.

136
00:07:27,363 --> 00:07:30,867
- That's brutal.
- Yeah.

137
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:33,202
- I just mean you're in good company.
- Thanks.

138
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:38,249
- [Sandy] But he actually said that you could cut it in half?
- That's crazy, right?

139
00:07:38,332 --> 00:07:39,876
I mean, it is...

140
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:42,545
a little wordy.

141
00:07:42,628 --> 00:07:44,589
[Ralphie] It's an epic saga.

142
00:07:44,672 --> 00:07:47,216
[Sandy] Right, honey. Are you sure
you should be writing a sequel? I mean...

143
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:50,970
The first thing they're gonna
ask when it sells is, "What's next?"

144
00:07:51,053 --> 00:07:53,848
Okay. No, I mean,
you're the expert.

145
00:07:53,931 --> 00:07:55,892
- Well, what do you suggest?
- Well, okay.

146
00:07:55,975 --> 00:07:57,393
Honey, you write so well.

147
00:07:57,476 --> 00:07:59,353
And you have
such a strong voice.

148
00:07:59,437 --> 00:08:01,772
So maybe you could
write something that's...

149
00:08:02,607 --> 00:08:04,609
like, more relatable.

150
00:08:04,692 --> 00:08:06,068
You know, Denise
at the Book Barn,

151
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:08,321
she says true crime
is the next big thing.

152
00:08:08,404 --> 00:08:09,739
[Ralphie]<i> That's it.</i>

153
00:08:09,822 --> 00:08:12,158
<i>A book about strangling Denise
from Book Barn.</i>

154
00:08:12,241 --> 00:08:13,868
Can I have another
piece of pizza?

155
00:08:13,951 --> 00:08:15,953
Here you go. Take mine.

156
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:21,083
Well, what do you guys
want for Christmas?

157
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:23,794
An Easy-Bake Oven,
Hungry Hungry Hippos

158
00:08:23,878 --> 00:08:25,171
and a stuffed kitty cat.

159
00:08:25,254 --> 00:08:27,715
[chuckles] Got it.
What about you?

160
00:08:27,798 --> 00:08:30,134
A Flexible Flyer F-23
Yankee Clipper.

161
00:08:30,218 --> 00:08:31,552
And what is that?

162
00:08:31,636 --> 00:08:34,514
- A sled.
- Oh, okay. I'm sorry.

163
00:08:34,597 --> 00:08:35,890
What do you want, Dad?

164
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:37,683
Want?

165
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:40,853
A time machine
to restart the year.

166
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:43,773
What I need is a new radiator
for the Plymouth.

167
00:08:43,856 --> 00:08:45,483
- [phone ringing]
- Oh. I got it. I got it.

168
00:08:45,566 --> 00:08:49,070
- Could be my manager with some good news.
- Okay.

169
00:08:49,153 --> 00:08:50,404
[Ralphie clears throat]

170
00:08:50,488 --> 00:08:52,823
Mr. Ralph Parker speaking.

171
00:08:52,907 --> 00:08:55,243
- Hi, Mom.
- Nope. It's Grandma.

172
00:08:58,287 --> 00:08:59,789
What's wrong?

173
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:00,748
What?

174
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:05,044
What?

175
00:09:10,091 --> 00:09:11,300
Wait. Wait a minute.

176
00:09:17,056 --> 00:09:18,099
Okay.

177
00:09:18,933 --> 00:09:20,142
[sniffs]

178
00:09:21,352 --> 00:09:22,436
Uh-huh.

179
00:09:23,187 --> 00:09:25,147
[sighs deeply]

180
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:27,316
Where are you now?

181
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,986
[Ralphie]<i> Nothing can
prepare us for one of life's</i>

182
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:33,406
<i>most painful
and inescapable events.</i>

183
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:37,910
<i>The passing of a parent.</i>

184
00:09:37,994 --> 00:09:38,995
Okay, Ma.

185
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:47,461
<i>As the sadness of losing
my old man took grip,</i>

186
00:09:47,545 --> 00:09:52,008
<i>two undeniable truths
washed over us that night.</i>

187
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:54,093
<i>Grandma needed us in Hohman,</i>

188
00:09:54,176 --> 00:09:58,556
<i>and this Christmas would
be nothing like we anticipated.</i>

189
00:10:08,232 --> 00:10:09,608
We're getting close.

190
00:10:09,692 --> 00:10:11,027
Yeah. You can taste it.

191
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:12,737
Oh, come on. It's not that bad.

192
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:15,781
You said the birds fly
backwards so they don't choke.

193
00:10:15,865 --> 00:10:18,743
And the sludge pool
swallowed children whole.

194
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:21,912
Does Santa go to Hohman?

195
00:10:21,996 --> 00:10:23,956
Yeah, of course.
Why wouldn't he?

196
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:27,835
Because Dad said winter in Hohman
is so bleak, it crushes the human spirit.

197
00:10:27,918 --> 00:10:30,212
[Ralphie]<i> Kids ignore every
important thing you say,</i>

198
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:32,214
<i>then recall
with painful accuracy</i>

199
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:35,926
<i>every incriminating word you've
uttered in the last five years.</i>

200
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:38,054
Honey, it's the opposite.

201
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:39,305
Santa loves Hohman.

202
00:10:39,388 --> 00:10:41,223
In fact, if you play
your cards right,

203
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:42,767
you'll get to meet him
at Higbee's.

204
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:44,769
But is it the real Santa Claus?

205
00:10:44,852 --> 00:10:47,563
Oh, it's him. Trust me.

206
00:10:47,646 --> 00:10:49,482
I'll see for myself.

207
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:56,447
Egg. [sighs]

208
00:10:57,531 --> 00:10:59,742
Oh. I'm sorry. It's cold.

209
00:10:59,825 --> 00:11:03,120
[Ralphie]<i> Ah! There is no nobler
a sacrifice for the common egg</i>

210
00:11:03,204 --> 00:11:07,041
<i>than the ingenious
automotive repair known as...</i>

211
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:10,378
<i>"The Midwest Souffle."</i>

212
00:11:10,461 --> 00:11:13,714
<i>One serving temporarily seals
any bum radiator,</i>

213
00:11:13,798 --> 00:11:18,386
<i>ensuring safe passage
to the next pit stop.</i>

214
00:11:18,469 --> 00:11:21,138
<i>Our car ate more eggs
than Cool Hand Luke.</i>

215
00:11:21,222 --> 00:11:23,224
[grunts] Come on! Stupid trunk!

216
00:11:24,266 --> 00:11:25,226
Stupid...

217
00:11:28,562 --> 00:11:30,314
[Ralphie]<i> Ah, there it was.</i>

218
00:11:30,398 --> 00:11:32,983
<i>Our old house
on Cleveland Street.</i>

219
00:11:33,067 --> 00:11:35,444
<i>It looked like it had
been frozen in time.</i>

220
00:11:36,695 --> 00:11:39,949
[Mrs. Parker gasps, chuckling]

221
00:11:40,032 --> 00:11:41,784
You're here!

222
00:11:41,867 --> 00:11:43,285
Oh, my goodness!

223
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:46,330
- Grandma!
- Grandma!

224
00:11:46,414 --> 00:11:48,707
Oh, my goodness!
I could eat you up. [kisses]

225
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:50,167
I missed you, Grandma!

226
00:11:50,251 --> 00:11:51,585
I love you guys.

227
00:11:52,461 --> 00:11:54,713
Oh, Sandy.

228
00:11:55,506 --> 00:11:56,549
I am so sorry.

229
00:11:56,632 --> 00:11:58,259
- Oh.
- [sniffles]

230
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:01,470
[both chuckle]

231
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:02,721
Hello, Mom.

232
00:12:02,805 --> 00:12:03,973
Ralphie.

233
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:05,558
I am so sorry, Mom.

234
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:07,977
He was the best.

235
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:09,562
[chuckles, sniffles]

236
00:12:09,645 --> 00:12:12,440
- I'm so glad that you all are here.
- Of course.

237
00:12:12,523 --> 00:12:14,567
And I don't want you to worry
about anything.

238
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:16,193
I'm gonna take care
of all the arrangements,

239
00:12:16,277 --> 00:12:17,319
- the service...
- No, no, no.

240
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:18,821
Listen to me, Ralphie.

241
00:12:18,904 --> 00:12:21,824
All that can wait. [chuckling]

242
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:24,952
Your father was so excited
about Christmas.

243
00:12:25,035 --> 00:12:28,497
[chuckling] I mean, if he
saw us moping around,

244
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:30,541
he'd just throw a fit.

245
00:12:30,624 --> 00:12:32,251
I've given this
a lot of thought.

246
00:12:32,334 --> 00:12:35,337
This can't be the thing that
we think of every Christmas.

247
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:38,382
We've gotta make it
a good memory, so...

248
00:12:38,466 --> 00:12:40,092
promise me...

249
00:12:40,176 --> 00:12:41,510
promise me...

250
00:12:42,887 --> 00:12:45,973
we're gonna make
this a wonderful Christmas.

251
00:12:46,056 --> 00:12:47,850
One that we'll never forget.

252
00:12:47,933 --> 00:12:49,727
Mom.

253
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:52,188
[Ralphie chuckles] <i>In the history
of tall orders, this one took the cake!</i>

254
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:57,234
<i>There was no way.
Impossible! Give up now, stupid!</i>

255
00:12:57,318 --> 00:12:58,277
I promise.

256
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:01,071
[chuckles] Okay.

257
00:13:01,155 --> 00:13:03,991
[Ralphie]<i> Oh, what had I done?</i>
<i>The old man was the reason</i>

258
00:13:04,074 --> 00:13:06,952
<i>for the greatest Christmases
any of us ever knew.</i>

259
00:13:07,036 --> 00:13:09,079
<i>And now it was all up to me?</i>

260
00:13:09,163 --> 00:13:11,207
<i>Get a grip, man!</i>

261
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:15,878
<i>Millions of folks pull it off every year
because everyone knows the recipe.</i>

262
00:13:17,755 --> 00:13:19,423
- [laughs]
- [exclaims]

263
00:13:20,216 --> 00:13:21,175
Oh.

264
00:13:21,884 --> 00:13:23,177
Oh, yeah!

265
00:13:24,136 --> 00:13:26,514
[all cheering]

266
00:13:29,975 --> 00:13:31,727
[all laughing]

267
00:13:33,604 --> 00:13:35,731
<i>I had to pull this off.</i>

268
00:13:35,814 --> 00:13:40,694
<i>For the memory of my old man,
and for every Christmas to come.</i>

269
00:13:44,114 --> 00:13:45,449
[grunts]

270
00:13:55,834 --> 00:13:59,088
[the old man]
Fragile.<i> It must be Italian.</i>

271
00:14:00,756 --> 00:14:03,008
- [dog barking]
<i>- Bumpuses!</i>

272
00:14:09,181 --> 00:14:10,808
<i>Not a finger!</i>

273
00:14:10,891 --> 00:14:13,811
[Ralphie] <i>It suddenly struck
me that my old man's voice</i>

274
00:14:13,894 --> 00:14:17,481
<i>would never echo
through these walls again.</i>

275
00:14:17,565 --> 00:14:19,858
[the old man, echoes]
<i>A fuse is out!</i>

276
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:23,445
[Ralphie]
<i>It was my old home.</i>

277
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:25,948
<i>With its light, its colors...</i>

278
00:14:27,157 --> 00:14:28,325
<i>its smells.</i>

279
00:14:29,451 --> 00:14:31,662
<i>But it was forever changed.</i>

280
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:37,626
<i>In the Southwest, it's said
they bring chili con carne.</i>

281
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:40,045
<i>Atlantic states, stew.</i>

282
00:14:40,129 --> 00:14:41,672
<i>But here in Hohman,</i>

283
00:14:41,755 --> 00:14:45,092
<i>it's the fabled casserole
that appears in times of need.</i>

284
00:14:45,175 --> 00:14:49,096
[exhales] I swear, every
neighbor dropped off a casserole.

285
00:14:49,179 --> 00:14:52,182
It's gonna take us a year
to finish all this. [chuckles]

286
00:14:52,266 --> 00:14:59,023
Mm. Well, this one looks like
tuna and olive and... beans?

287
00:14:59,106 --> 00:15:01,734
Hm. Uh,
I think that's a blueberry.

288
00:15:01,817 --> 00:15:03,736
Uh, I think, let's see.

289
00:15:03,819 --> 00:15:08,115
[Mrs. Parker] This one is, uh, cream,
beans, and pickled carrots and...

290
00:15:08,198 --> 00:15:09,825
Mm...

291
00:15:09,908 --> 00:15:13,078
And tastes of cinnamon. Mm.

292
00:15:13,162 --> 00:15:14,830
So inventive.

293
00:15:14,913 --> 00:15:17,166
[Ralphie]<i> No matter</i>
<i>the tongue-curling flavors</i>

294
00:15:17,249 --> 00:15:19,501
<i>or indistinguishable
ingredients,</i>

295
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:23,672
<i>no one dared waste food
in my mother's house.</i>

296
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:28,719
I'm so touched that everyone
has gone to all this trouble for us.

297
00:15:28,802 --> 00:15:30,638
Will we have turkey
on Christmas?

298
00:15:30,721 --> 00:15:33,098
Oh, no. We have
to finish all this first.

299
00:15:33,182 --> 00:15:35,225
- [groans]
- Oh, hot, hot, hot.

300
00:15:35,309 --> 00:15:37,353
- Yum.
- Oh, my.

301
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:39,605
- Ketchup and what?
- Mm.

302
00:15:39,688 --> 00:15:40,856
What do you think that is?

303
00:15:40,939 --> 00:15:41,857
It's mayonnaise.

304
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:42,733
Yeah.

305
00:15:42,816 --> 00:15:44,026
Cooked mayonnaise.

306
00:15:44,109 --> 00:15:45,444
[dog barking]

307
00:15:46,945 --> 00:15:49,698
[grunts] It's colder here
than in Chicago.

308
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:51,825
It's looking pretty good.

309
00:15:51,909 --> 00:15:55,287
I don't know. His arms
aren't even the same size.

310
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:57,373
He doesn't know that.

311
00:15:57,456 --> 00:16:00,668
[Ralphie]<i> Oh, this would surely be a
highlight of Mark and Julie's Christmas.</i>

312
00:16:00,751 --> 00:16:03,462
<i>A close encounter
with Delbert Bumpus.</i>

<i>The smartest member of
the hillbilly family next door.</i>

[gulps] Ah!

316
00:16:19,937 --> 00:16:21,271
Hey.

317
00:16:21,355 --> 00:16:22,690
Hey yourself.

318
00:16:22,773 --> 00:16:24,566
We're building a snowman.

319
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:26,610
His name is Sparklypoof.

320
00:16:26,694 --> 00:16:28,737
We did not agree on that.

321
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:30,447
- Bad idea.
- [engine revving]

322
00:16:33,909 --> 00:16:36,745

Whoo! [laughs]

327
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:52,428
[Ralphie]<i> By God! The
neighborhood bullies reincarnate.</i>

328

<i>What was once
mere beatings and shakedowns</i>

329
00:16:54,805 --> 00:16:58,517
<i>had evolved into surprise
attacks of mechanized terror.</i>

330
00:16:59,309 --> 00:17:00,519
Yeah!

331
00:17:00,602 --> 00:17:03,689
- [whooping]
- They murdered Sparklypoof!

[bullies chuckling]

333
00:17:05,232 --> 00:17:07,901
[bully] Grab it. Grab it! Yeah!
I got your scarf!

That's mine!

Hey, you get back here!

- [whooping, laughing]
- Hey, bring that back!

337
00:17:14,616 --> 00:17:16,910
Well, this town is
full of surprises, isn't it?

338
00:17:16,994 --> 00:17:19,038
How fun.

339
00:17:19,121 --> 00:17:21,415
- Uh, come on. Let's go inside.

00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:37,973
and I asked him to call here
with any news.

344
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:40,893
So please pick up the phone,
day or night, okay?

345
00:17:40,976 --> 00:17:42,019
Yeah.

346
00:17:42,102 --> 00:17:44,980
Ralphie, how is it going
with your novel?

347
00:17:45,063 --> 00:17:50,027
[Ralphie]<i> Oh, if mothers knew every rocky
detail of our lives, they'd never sleep.</i>

348
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:52,321
<i>Best to keep her off the scent.</i>

349
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:55,032
Oh, I got some
real nice irons in the fire.

350
00:17:55,115 --> 00:17:58,494
Oh. Well, you know, that's
really good to know. [chuckles]

351
00:17:58,577 --> 00:18:00,954
[Ralphie]<i> Whew.</i>
<i>Out of the frying pan...</i>

352
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:06,418
That way, we can really focus
on getting into the Christmas spirit.

353
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:08,462
[Ralphie]<i> ...and into the fire.</i>

354
00:18:11,548 --> 00:18:13,217
Absolutely.

355
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:14,301
It's gonna be great.

356
00:18:14,384 --> 00:18:16,386
Well, it's only five days away.

357
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:17,638
Well, Ralph's got this.

358
00:18:17,721 --> 00:18:18,806
- Yeah?
- Right?

359
00:18:18,889 --> 00:18:20,766
Oh, you bet. Uh...

360
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:23,685
We're gonna do it all.
[chuckles]

361
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:28,440
Aw... That would make
your father so happy, Ralphie.

362
00:18:28,524 --> 00:18:31,318
I can't wait to see what you're
gonna do with it. [chuckles]

363
00:18:31,401 --> 00:18:33,153
[Ralphie]<i> Oh,</i>
<i>that makes two of us.</i>

364
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:34,696
<i>I gotta figure this out.</i>

365
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:36,907
You know,
I think I'm gonna take a walk.

366
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:40,786
Um, just get some fresh air,
maybe clear my head a little bit.

367
00:18:40,869 --> 00:18:42,079
I'll be back.

368
00:18:43,497 --> 00:18:46,583
[dogs barking]

369
00:18:46,667 --> 00:18:47,918
Come on, get out of here!

<i>Not the Bumpus hounds, too.</i>

371
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:52,506
<i>They tormented my old man
his whole life.</i>

372
00:18:52,589 --> 00:18:56,093
<i>Now even they expected me
to fill his shoes.</i>

373
00:18:57,344 --> 00:18:59,137
<i>Uh, how was I supposed</i>

374
00:18:59,221 --> 00:19:02,140
<i>to replace the greatest
Christmas ringmaster of all time?</i>

375
00:19:02,224 --> 00:19:05,727
<i>Especially when he was the one
everyone was missing.</i>

376
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:09,481

<i>Before that, he was best known
as the genius</i>

383

<i>who once stuck his tongue
to a frozen flag pole.</i>

384

[all cheering]

386
00:19:44,766 --> 00:19:45,893
Down by one.

You're up, Schwartz.

388
00:19:48,103 --> 00:19:49,354
Last shot.

running up his tab at Flick's,</i>

392

For all the donuts, suckers.

[Ralphie]
<i>Could it be? Schwartz?</i>

394
00:20:07,581 --> 00:20:08,874
<i>In a moment of triumph?</i>

395
00:20:12,544 --> 00:20:13,670
<i>Not a chance.</i>

396
00:20:13,754 --> 00:20:15,589
[man] He did it again!

397
00:20:15,672 --> 00:20:17,341
Congratulations
to the Slag Heaps!

398
00:20:17,424 --> 00:20:19,801
Come on, drink up,
everybody. Drink it up.

399
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:20,844
Here we go.

[indistinct chatter]

401
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:27,309
Looks like I backed
the wrong team.

402
00:20:27,392 --> 00:20:29,186
Again.

403
00:20:29,269 --> 00:20:30,854
- Well, if it wasn't such a junk table.
- Junk? I just had it waxed.

That's 'cause

Yeah, you've got an...

411

- [both] Ralphie!
- Hey!

- [chuckling, cheering]
- Am I glad to see you guys.

Come, have a drink!
The cosmopolitan man returns.

414
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:49,456
Yeah, Mr. Big Shot, gracing us
small town folk with his presence.

415
00:20:49,539 --> 00:20:52,167
Yeah. Come on, I could
never forget about you guys.

416
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:53,961
Believe me, I tried.

417
00:20:54,044 --> 00:20:56,171
[Ralphie] <i>Truth was, years
ago, I had promised myself</i>

418

<i>that I wouldn't return to Hohman
until I was a genuine success.</i>

419
00:21:00,217 --> 00:21:04,763
<i>And now, I didn't have the heart
to tell them the embarrassing truth.</i>

420
00:21:04,846 --> 00:21:06,932
Hey, Flick! Come on,
get us all a round, right?

421
00:21:07,015 --> 00:21:08,558
- Put it on my tab. Come on.
- Yeah.

422
00:21:08,642 --> 00:21:10,519
What? I'll pay my tab.

423
00:21:10,602 --> 00:21:11,687
Eventually.

424
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:12,729
Mm-hmm.

425
00:21:12,813 --> 00:21:14,398
Now, here's you two.

426
00:21:14,481 --> 00:21:15,983
Here's mine.

427
00:21:16,066 --> 00:21:18,318
Ralph, to your old man.

428
00:21:18,402 --> 00:21:19,778
Hell of a guy.

429
00:21:19,861 --> 00:21:21,321
Thanks.

430
00:21:21,405 --> 00:21:22,948
Sorry, Ralphie.

431
00:21:23,031 --> 00:21:24,825
He was the best.

432
00:21:24,908 --> 00:21:26,827
- To the old man.
- [both] To the old man.

- [all gasp]

Yes. Is Larry here?

439

Is Larry Novak here?

440
00:21:49,516 --> 00:21:50,642
[mouthing] No.

441
00:21:50,726 --> 00:21:52,853
Nope. Sorry, Mrs. Novak.
Larry's not here.

442
00:21:52,936 --> 00:21:56,356
Yes, you have
a Merry Christmas as well.

443
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:58,525

happened to your high school quarterback?</i>

<i>Ours turned into
good old Larry Novak.</i>

446
00:22:04,239 --> 00:22:06,742
So what do you guys do around
here for Christmas these days?

447
00:22:06,825 --> 00:22:08,452
[sighs] It's the same here
as it's always been.

448
00:22:08,535 --> 00:22:09,619
Yeah, just the usual.

449
00:22:09,703 --> 00:22:11,121
No, the usual's
not gonna cut it.

450
00:22:11,204 --> 00:22:13,040
I need something more.
It's all on me this year.

451
00:22:13,123 --> 00:22:15,917
Well, in that case,
I suggest you start drinking

452
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:17,252
and don't stop till New Year's.

453
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:18,920
No, this is serious.

454
00:22:19,463 --> 00:22:20,255
Larry?

455
00:22:20,338 --> 00:22:21,590
What do you want from me?

456
00:22:21,673 --> 00:22:23,675
I come here to avoid my family.

457
00:22:25,093 --> 00:22:27,471
All right. Got an idea.
Here, you take that.

458
00:22:27,554 --> 00:22:29,639
- We'll come up with some idea.
- All right.

459
00:22:29,723 --> 00:22:32,225
So, let's make a list. It's okay. You're
gonna be fine. We got this. Okay.

460
00:22:32,309 --> 00:22:34,603
Ooh! But first,
line 'em up again.

461
00:22:34,686 --> 00:22:36,980
- To lubricate our brains, right? Come on.
- It's a good idea.

462
00:22:37,064 --> 00:22:39,733
- Christmas is...
- I have a terrarium.

463
00:22:40,942 --> 00:22:42,069
Okay.

464
00:22:42,152 --> 00:22:45,363
It's a fish tank
for snakes and lizards.

465
00:22:45,447 --> 00:22:47,240
It's very stimulating.

466
00:22:47,324 --> 00:22:49,451
- [Schwartz] Ah.
- Cool. That's a great start. I love terrariums.

467
00:22:49,534 --> 00:22:52,079
Hey. My sister knows
a guy who owns a Cessna.

468
00:22:52,162 --> 00:22:54,790
- My cousin Craig, he's got a buffalo.
- Yeah.

469
00:22:54,873 --> 00:22:56,291
Oh, that'd be fantastic.

470
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:58,460
- It's huge.
- No bad ideas, guys. Keep 'em coming.

471
00:22:58,543 --> 00:23:00,337
I need this stuff.

472
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:02,089
- We got you covered. We got you.
- It's the kind of magic I need.

473
00:23:02,172 --> 00:23:02,672
- Come on, to Christmas.
- We got you. Christmas!

00:23:15,352 --> 00:23:16,812
Ralph?

477
00:23:16,895 --> 00:23:19,314
It's almost 10:00.
Are you awake?

478
00:23:19,397 --> 00:23:21,316
- Uh-uh.
- Mm.

479
00:23:21,399 --> 00:23:23,276
[smacks lips, breathes deeply]

480
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:27,072
So, is this the list?

481
00:23:27,155 --> 00:23:30,659
You know, the one you
woke me up about at 3:00 am?

482
00:23:30,742 --> 00:23:31,868
Yeah.

483
00:23:31,952 --> 00:23:34,621
That's my Christmas plan.
[grunting]

484
00:23:34,704 --> 00:23:36,665
Okay. All right.

485
00:23:36,748 --> 00:23:39,417
Well, you know,
some of these are good.

486
00:23:39,501 --> 00:23:41,002
Yeah, sledding. That's great.

487
00:23:41,086 --> 00:23:42,504
Maybe you and Mark
could do that.

488
00:23:42,587 --> 00:23:44,548
- You know, father-son outing.
- Okay. Great.

489
00:23:44,631 --> 00:23:47,425
But some of these are...

490
00:23:47,509 --> 00:23:48,677
wax throwing?

491
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:50,178
Axe. Axe throwing.

492
00:23:50,262 --> 00:23:53,849
- With the tomahawks and stuff.
- Okay. Even better.

493
00:23:53,932 --> 00:23:57,769
Uh, "Make them catch and kill
their own turkey." Ooh. [chuckles]

494
00:23:57,853 --> 00:24:00,397
Well, maybe we could combine
that with the axe throwing.

495
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,190
Could be fun
for the kids, I think.

496
00:24:02,274 --> 00:24:05,193
Right here,
"Volunteer at a soup kitchen."

497
00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:07,028
See, that one's crossed off.

498
00:24:07,112 --> 00:24:08,530
Yeah, it could be too much.

499
00:24:08,613 --> 00:24:10,198
Polar bear plunge.

500
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:12,200
- Terrarium.
- Yeah.

501
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:14,035
- Chips and salsa.
- Larry has one.

502
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:15,745
Overthrow Castro. I'm in.

503
00:24:15,829 --> 00:24:17,414
Ambitious. But we can do it.

504
00:24:17,497 --> 00:24:19,708
Buffalo.
Three exclamation points.

505
00:24:19,791 --> 00:24:21,042
So, do we move there?

506
00:24:21,126 --> 00:24:23,086
No, no, no.
We're gonna bring it here.

507
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:24,963
[laughing] It's buffalo?

508
00:24:25,046 --> 00:24:26,423
Like an animal?

509
00:24:26,506 --> 00:24:28,258
Yeah, some of these
need to bake, but...

510
00:24:28,341 --> 00:24:31,720
You know, honey, I think you're
maybe overcomplicating this.

511
00:24:31,803 --> 00:24:33,471
Why don't we just

00:31:36,352 --> 00:31:38,271
Isn't it great?

682
00:31:38,354 --> 00:31:41,691
We probably should've trimmed
the tree before we brought it inside.

683
00:31:41,774 --> 00:31:43,526
No, that's just a saying.

684
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:45,236
Nobody trims trees.

685
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:46,904
Besides, it's perfect.

686
00:31:46,988 --> 00:31:49,532
[grunts, sighs]

687
00:31:49,616 --> 00:31:52,869
Yeah. Kinda looks like
it's going through puberty.

688
00:31:52,952 --> 00:31:55,038
No wonder they gave it
to us for four bucks.

689
00:31:55,121 --> 00:31:59,792
No, it's a wonder how I actually
negotiated the deal of a lifetime.

690
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:03,630
Oh! [chuckles]

691
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:06,591
[laughs]

692
00:32:06,674 --> 00:32:09,052
- Let's get to work. Come on!

693
00:32:09,135 --> 00:32:11,179
- Okay!
- Come on! Let's go!

694
00:32:11,262 --> 00:32:12,305
Decoration time!

695
00:32:12,388 --> 00:32:14,682
A beautiful little angel.

696
00:32:14,766 --> 00:32:16,643
- [radio powers off]
- [Sandy] Radio.

697
00:32:16,726 --> 00:32:18,019
Radio. Okay.

698
00:32:18,102 --> 00:32:20,688
Um, what about this one?
Nothing important?

699
00:32:20,772 --> 00:32:22,023
- No.
- [Ralphie] All right.

700
00:32:22,106 --> 00:32:24,442
Three, two, one...

701
00:32:24,525 --> 00:32:26,152
- [music resumes]
- Hey!

702
00:32:26,235 --> 00:32:28,029
[all cheering]

703
00:32:28,112 --> 00:32:29,697
I don't think we should
have so much red.

704
00:32:33,701 --> 00:32:34,869
I like that. Ooh.

705
00:32:34,952 --> 00:32:36,746
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

706
00:32:36,829 --> 00:32:37,872
[exclaims]

707
00:32:39,415 --> 00:32:41,376
Cheers. You, too, yeah.

708
00:32:41,459 --> 00:32:43,878
[Ralphie] <i>Now, one of the
best reasons to have children</i>

709
00:32:43,961 --> 00:32:48,174
<i>is to make them do the things
you don't wanna do as an adult.</i>

710
00:32:48,257 --> 00:32:49,509
This a good place?

711
00:32:49,592 --> 00:32:50,718
- Higher than that.
- [Ralphie] Go, go, go.

712
00:32:50,802 --> 00:32:51,719
- Here?
- [Sandy] Your hand.

713
00:32:51,803 --> 00:32:52,929
- Yeah. Now up.
- Now in.

714
00:32:53,012 --> 00:32:53,971
- Here?
- Both.

715
00:32:54,055 --> 00:32:55,473
In and up.

716
00:32:55,556 --> 00:32:57,016
- Go in and up.
- Why didn't you just point there?

717
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:58,851
- [Ralphie] Looks good.
- Yeah.

718
00:32:58,935 --> 00:33:01,896
- Keep it up, guys.
- How come you're not helping?

719
00:33:01,979 --> 00:33:04,065
- We're having fun watching you.
- Yeah.

720
00:33:04,148 --> 00:33:07,485
When it's just us, it kind
of feels like child labor.

721
00:33:07,568 --> 00:33:08,903
[laughs]

722
00:33:08,986 --> 00:33:11,072
Oh, no, honey, it's not labor
if we don't pay you.

723
00:33:11,155 --> 00:33:13,408
- Yeah.
- [both groan]

724
00:33:13,491 --> 00:33:15,660
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

725
00:33:15,743 --> 00:33:17,954
You're hanging too many
on the bottom.

726
00:33:18,037 --> 00:33:21,249
- Well, I can't reach that height!
- Use the ladder.

727
00:33:21,332 --> 00:33:22,709
[chuckles]

728
00:33:22,792 --> 00:33:23,876
[Sandy] Careful, honey.

729
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:25,128
Yeah, Mark, hold the ladder.

730
00:33:25,211 --> 00:33:27,088
I am!

731
00:33:27,171 --> 00:33:28,756
[Ralphie] Yeah, you're
doing good, honey.

732
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:30,508
- Just get up a little higher.
- It looks really good.

733
00:33:30,591 --> 00:33:31,676
What next?

734
00:33:31,759 --> 00:33:33,094
We have the whole side
over here,

735
00:33:33,177 --> 00:33:34,470
- the one that faces the window.
- Mm-hm.

736

[sighs]

737
00:33:35,972 --> 00:33:38,099
Grandma! Are you sleeping?

738
00:33:38,182 --> 00:33:40,143
No, just resting my eyes.

739
00:33:43,354 --> 00:33:45,356
It was more fun with all of us.

740
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:48,693
Yeah. Grandpa always helped us
finish the tree.

741
00:33:48,776 --> 00:33:50,486
- You know what? You're right.
- Yep.

742
00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:52,947
- All right. Here we come. Come on.
- Okay.

743
00:33:53,030 --> 00:33:56,159
- [Ralphie] The tree topper!
- It's not an angel.

744
00:33:56,242 --> 00:33:57,952
We always have an angel.

745
00:33:58,035 --> 00:34:00,705
[Ralphie]
<i>Uh-oh. Better think fast.</i>

746
00:34:00,788 --> 00:34:02,290
Not here in Hohman.

747
00:34:03,666 --> 00:34:04,959
Uh-oh!

748
00:34:05,042 --> 00:34:06,419
Here. Honey, hold this,
will you?

749
00:34:06,502 --> 00:34:08,212
Kids, come over here
by Grandma. Come on.

750
00:34:08,296 --> 00:34:09,964
[Ralphie]<i> To hook</i>
<i>this little guppy,</i>

751
00:34:10,047 --> 00:34:13,760
<i>I'd need just the right combo
of mystique and legend.</i>

752
00:34:13,843 --> 00:34:16,971
Here in Hohman,
it's star country.

753
00:34:17,054 --> 00:34:19,891
If you don't have a star,
you can forget about it.

754
00:34:19,974 --> 00:34:22,310
Santa won't even stop
by your house.

755
00:34:22,393 --> 00:34:23,728
Wait. Huh?

756
00:34:23,811 --> 00:34:25,396
[whispering] I'm improvising.

757
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:27,440
Building new traditions.

758
00:34:27,523 --> 00:34:29,942
- It's good.
- Okay.

759
00:34:30,026 --> 00:34:31,360
No doubt about it.

760
00:34:32,236 --> 00:34:34,197
Around these parts...

761
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:36,908
no star, no Christmas.

762
00:34:36,991 --> 00:34:40,870
- [Ralphie] <i>Come on, take the bait.</i>
- Mm.

763
00:34:40,953 --> 00:34:42,663
<i>That's it.</i>

764
00:34:42,747 --> 00:34:43,915
Okay.

767
00:34:51,714 --> 00:34:54,383
- [Sandy] Ralph, we're leaving in 15.
- Okay.

768
00:34:56,385 --> 00:34:59,388
- [Sandy] How's it going up here?
- Oh. Couldn't be better.

769
00:35:03,768 --> 00:35:04,977
Look at this.

770
00:35:05,061 --> 00:35:07,105
These obituaries
are so impersonal.

771
00:35:07,188 --> 00:35:10,233
Well, make it un-impersonal.

772
00:35:10,316 --> 00:35:13,694
This will be the last time most
folks ever give him a thought.

773
00:35:13,778 --> 00:35:14,862
It's a lot of pressure.

774
00:35:14,946 --> 00:35:15,947
Yeah.

775
00:35:17,990 --> 00:35:20,284
If anyone can do it, it's you.

776
00:35:20,368 --> 00:35:23,204
- I gotta finish getting ready.
- All right. I'll be down in a few.

777
00:35:23,287 --> 00:35:24,372
Okay.

778
00:35:24,455 --> 00:35:25,748

Yeah.

Well, who were you expecting,
President Nixon?

[Ralphie] <i>To everyone's
amazement, my kid brother, Randy,</i>

00:36:22,138 --> 00:36:25,099
<i>traveling the globe for

798
00:36:25,182 --> 00:36:27,310
[Randy]<i> So I'm calling to see</i>

799
00:36:27,393 --> 00:36:29,270
Yeah, she said
you're on your way.

00:36:29,353 --> 00:36:32,899
[sighs] Look, Ralph, it's...

801
00:36:32,982 --> 00:36:36,903
it's not that easy getting
from India to Indiana.

802
00:36:36,986 --> 00:36:38,779
But you're working on it, right?

803
00:36:38,863 --> 00:36:40,364
<i>Yeah. I'm at the airport.</i>

<i>Now, the unspoken

What does that mean?

812
00:37:01,928 --> 00:37:04,722
She finally ate something.
Thank God.

813
00:37:05,848 --> 00:37:07,224
Half a cracker.

814
00:37:07,308 --> 00:37:08,309
<i>A cracker?</i>

Wait, that's it? A cracker?

Yeah, she's still in bed.

- [whispers] Hi, Mom.
- [mouthing] Hi.

818
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:16,192

A...

822
00:37:21,656 --> 00:37:23,115
It was one word.

823
00:37:24,158 --> 00:37:25,076
<i>She said...</i>

"Randy."

Oh.

826
00:37:28,746 --> 00:37:30,498
But we all know how busy you are

827

- and how hard you're trying to get here.
<i>- No, wait!</i>

<i>- Ralphie, don't go.</i>
- Oh. I think she's up.

830
00:37:34,418 --> 00:37:35,169
Ralphie, don't go, don't go.

831
00:37:35,252 --> 00:37:37,213
Okay, gotta go.

832
00:37:37,296 --> 00:37:38,839

- Good luck, Randy. Bye.

Let's go. Come on!

1024
00:45:49,288 --> 00:45:51,457
Don't you dare! Ah!

1025
00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:52,458
Oh, Lord.

1026
00:45:52,541 --> 00:45:53,500
[male elf] Jeez! Get the mop.

1027
00:45:53,584 --> 00:45:55,335
Go get the mop. Come on.

1028
00:45:55,419 --> 00:45:56,503
- You gotta put it in a letter this year.
- Get out of here, kid.

1029
00:45:56,587 --> 00:45:57,087
Come back tomorrow.

1030
00:45:57,171 --> 00:45:58,505
[laughs]

1031
00:45:58,589 --> 00:46:00,132
I really shouldn't drink
this much on an empty stomach.

1032
00:46:00,215 --> 00:46:02,593
- I have a candy cane in my purse.
- Mm.

1033
00:46:02,676 --> 00:46:04,845

[male elf] Merry Christmas!

1038
00:46:26,867 --> 00:46:29,161
So you're the real Santa Claus?

1039
00:46:29,244 --> 00:46:30,996
[male elf] Oh, here we go again.

1040
00:46:31,872 --> 00:46:33,040
Why, yes, I am.

1041

- Eight.

1042
00:46:35,209 --> 00:46:37,920

90 North by 135 West.

1047
00:46:47,971 --> 00:46:50,807
You're good. Very good.

1048
00:46:50,891 --> 00:46:52,100
Yes, I am.

1052

- Yes, I am!

1053

Okay. I want...

1054

00:47:13,497 --> 00:47:15,123
Well, the cat, I can do.

1056

The other thing,
you're on your own.

1057
00:47:18,168 --> 00:47:19,169
Deal.

1058
00:47:20,504 --> 00:47:23,924
All right. Here we go.
Merry Christmas! Hey!

Hey, Santa. What other thing?

1060
00:47:27,052 --> 00:47:28,971
The kid asked for a radiator...

1061
00:47:29,888 --> 00:47:31,765

- We're out.
- Ah, you gotta be kidding.

1081
00:48:16,268 --> 00:48:18,645
All right. Well, get comfortable.
It's gonna be a while.

Mom, can we play in the snow?

1085

Yeah. Why not?

1086
00:48:26,903 --> 00:48:28,739
Bring your gloves.

[Ralphie] No, no, no.
That's not how you do it.

1091
00:48:37,497 --> 00:48:40,167
You gotta pack it tighter
if you want it to go further.

1092
00:48:40,250 --> 00:48:42,044
Here, let me show you.

1093
00:48:42,127 --> 00:48:43,670
You gotta pack it up.

1094

Come on, you guys have
made snowballs before. Here.

1095
00:48:46,256 --> 00:48:48,342
If you want it to go far,
you gotta pack it. Pack it.

1096
00:48:48,425 --> 00:48:51,261
Push it. See, the tighter you
pack it, the further it will go.

1097
00:48:51,345 --> 00:48:53,847
Like this. Then it goes...

1098
00:48:53,930 --> 00:48:56,683
Like that, all right?
Good luck.

1099
00:48:57,434 --> 00:48:58,727

00:49:01,605 --> 00:49:03,106
[Ralphie] The question is...

1102
00:49:04,316 --> 00:49:06,360
do you have enough ammo?

1103
00:49:06,443 --> 00:49:07,819
[all grunt]

1104
00:49:07,903 --> 00:49:09,029

Uh... me and Mark.

- Want to bet?

- Dad, you ran three stop signs.
- Thank you, Mark.

1135
00:50:21,143 --> 00:50:22,185
He is your dad.

1136

[Ralphie] She's fine.

- Come on, honey.
- [Mrs. Parker] Are we home?

1140
00:50:28,024 --> 00:50:29,234
No, Mom. We're at the hospital.

1141
00:50:29,317 --> 00:50:30,610
Would you get
in the hospital, please?

1142
00:50:30,694 --> 00:50:32,195
[Mark] Is she gonna
lose her eyeball?

1143
00:50:32,279 --> 00:50:34,030
[Ralphie] She's not
losing anything. Get inside.

1144
00:50:34,114 --> 00:50:36,408
[Mark] You let her
have it. Pow!

1145
00:50:36,491 --> 00:50:37,909
[Ralphie] Yes, I was there.
I saw.

1146
00:50:37,993 --> 00:50:39,453
[Sandy] You'll be okay,
sweetheart.

No, it's okay, honey.

1161

gonna be a couple of days, tops.

- We'll get you safe.
- Um, Ralph...

wrapped up in a few days.

make a difference...

00:52:50,083 --> 00:52:53,086
I know. I know.
I'm getting to that.

1192
00:52:53,169 --> 00:52:55,338
Ralph, I know you'll write
a great obituary.

1193
00:52:55,422 --> 00:52:58,800
But right now,
we need to focus on Christmas.

1194
00:52:58,884 --> 00:53:01,094
Yeah, I know.
I'd love nothing more.

1195
00:53:01,177 --> 00:53:05,515
But I'm just a little hung up on the monsters
that stole presents from our children.

1196
00:53:05,599 --> 00:53:07,976
I had everything. I had
everything. Every gift.

1197
00:53:08,059 --> 00:53:09,936
You were a sight
to behold at Higbee's.

1198
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:11,813
I was. I really was.

1199
00:53:11,897 --> 00:53:13,899
But then, you know, we get into
a snowball fight, we're having fun,

1200
00:53:13,982 --> 00:53:15,984
and then Mark says, "Hey, I
bet you can't hit me from here!"

1201
00:53:16,067 --> 00:53:17,986
- And then she just came out of nowhere.
- Ralph...

1202
00:53:18,069 --> 00:53:20,113
- I mean, I didn't see her. She just sort of teleported.
- Ralph.

1203
00:53:20,196 --> 00:53:23,450
Honey, everyone knows that you
did not try to bean our daughter.

1204
00:53:23,533 --> 00:53:25,285
[sighing] Man.

1205
00:53:25,368 --> 00:53:26,494
This is, you know...

1206
00:53:26,578 --> 00:53:29,623
My dad made this all
look so easy.

1207
00:53:29,706 --> 00:53:31,583
Yeah, that's what
good parents do.

1208
00:53:31,666 --> 00:53:34,419
But that doesn't mean
it was easy.

1209
00:53:34,502 --> 00:53:36,296
So, look, I put together
all our cash

1210
00:53:36,379 --> 00:53:38,131
and what we have left
of the Christmas fund

1211
00:53:38,214 --> 00:53:41,968
and we can still
get the kids some presents.

1212
00:53:42,761 --> 00:53:44,930
How much do we have?

1213
00:53:45,013 --> 00:53:47,057
Including the change
from the ashtray...

1214
00:53:48,558 --> 00:53:50,352
$21.17.

1215
00:53:50,435 --> 00:53:52,771
[Ralphie]<i> Oh!</i>
<i>It was worse than I thought.</i>

1216
00:53:52,854 --> 00:53:54,898
<i>Things had sunk to a new low,</i>

1217
00:53:54,981 --> 00:53:59,402
<i>forcing us to attempt the most
delicate of parental maneuvers...</i>

1218
00:53:59,486 --> 00:54:02,238
<i>the lowering of expectations.</i>

1219
00:54:02,322 --> 00:54:04,950
- [Julie] It's crazy.
- Hey, kids.

1220
00:54:05,033 --> 00:54:08,828
So, this Christmas, we
thought it might be really fun

1221
00:54:08,912 --> 00:54:11,331
to focus a little more
on gratitude.

1222
00:54:11,414 --> 00:54:12,374
Yeah.

1223
00:54:12,457 --> 00:54:13,833
Wait, what's going on?

1224
00:54:13,917 --> 00:54:15,961
[Ralphie]<i> That was fast.</i>

1225
00:54:16,044 --> 00:54:18,046
Well, that's what
we wanted to talk about.

1226
00:54:18,129 --> 00:54:22,550
Um, because Christmas isn't really
about how many great gifts you get.

1227
00:54:22,634 --> 00:54:24,177
- Oh, no.
- Isn't it?

1228
00:54:24,260 --> 00:54:26,930
- [Ralphie] <i>They're onto us.</i>
- No. It isn't, Mark.

1229
00:54:27,013 --> 00:54:31,017
Because this is part of Christmas,
right? And maybe the best part.

1230
00:54:31,101 --> 00:54:32,686
Mm-hm.

1231
00:54:32,769 --> 00:54:35,814
Yeah, all of us together,
enjoying delicious home-cooked...

1232
00:54:35,897 --> 00:54:37,023
food.

1233
00:54:37,107 --> 00:54:38,191
[flies buzzing]

1234
00:54:38,274 --> 00:54:40,026
[Ralphie]<i> Nice try, Sandy.</i>

1235
00:54:40,110 --> 00:54:42,153
Are you saying we're not getting
presents, just more casserole?

1236
00:54:42,237 --> 00:54:43,530
[Ralphie] No, no, no.
[Sandy] No.

1237
00:54:43,613 --> 00:54:46,241
What your mom
is trying to help me say

1238
00:54:46,324 --> 00:54:48,785
- is that there will be presents.
- Mm-hm.

1239
00:54:48,868 --> 00:54:53,456
- Yeah.
- Just more likely not the ones you wanted.

1240
00:54:53,540 --> 00:54:55,208
Does this mean
Santa's not coming?

1241
00:54:55,291 --> 00:54:57,627
[Ralphie] <i>Bail out,
bail out! Eject, eject!</i>

1242
00:54:57,711 --> 00:54:59,379
No, no. Of course he's coming.

1243
00:54:59,462 --> 00:55:01,047
[Ralphie] Because Santa always
comes. [Sandy] Yeah. Yeah.

1244
00:55:01,131 --> 00:55:02,966
No, we just want you to keep
one thing in mind.

1245
00:55:03,049 --> 00:55:06,428
[Ralphie]<i> Oh, please, please.</i>
<i>Don't say it.</i>

1246
00:55:06,511 --> 00:55:08,138
It's the thought that counts.

1247
00:55:08,221 --> 00:55:10,181
[Ralphie]<i> Oh, no! She said it!</i>

1248
00:55:10,265 --> 00:55:13,393
<i>Kids can smell that stinker
from a mile away.</i>

1249
00:55:13,476 --> 00:55:15,353
So, Christmas is gonna suck?

1250
00:55:15,437 --> 00:55:18,648
I knew it! This means I'm
not getting a sled, doesn't it?

1251
00:55:18,732 --> 00:55:22,277
Okay, less attitude
and more gratitude, mister.

1252
00:55:22,360 --> 00:55:23,570
[door closes]

1253
00:55:23,653 --> 00:55:27,240
[sighs] Well, they certainly
got the message.

1254
00:55:27,323 --> 00:55:29,909
Can you just go after Mark?

1255
00:55:33,997 --> 00:55:35,040
Sorry.

1256
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:43,506
Wanna play Spades?

1257
00:55:44,924 --> 00:55:46,342
One-Eyed Jacks?

1258
00:55:47,719 --> 00:55:49,345
No, thanks, Grandma.

1259
00:55:49,429 --> 00:55:51,931
I have something important
I need to figure out.

1260
00:56:12,786 --> 00:56:14,537
Mark, let's go for a walk.

1261
00:56:16,831 --> 00:56:17,916
Come on.

1262
00:56:20,293 --> 00:56:21,628
Suds for Dad,

1263
00:56:21,711 --> 00:56:23,213
Shirley Temple for the kid.

1264
00:56:25,465 --> 00:56:26,925
To Christmas.

1265
00:56:27,008 --> 00:56:28,343
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

1266
00:56:28,426 --> 00:56:30,804
[Ralphie]<i> Ah, the genius</i>
<i>of the Shirley Temple.</i>

1267
00:56:30,887 --> 00:56:36,267
<i>A few simple ingredients that can make
a kid feel like he's one of the grown-ups.</i>

1268
00:56:36,351 --> 00:56:38,186
[Flick] Oh, no, no. Ralphie.

1269
00:56:38,269 --> 00:56:40,480
After the week you've had, don't
worry about it. It's on the house.

1270
00:56:40,563 --> 00:56:42,607
Whoa! Did I hear
"on the house"?

1271
00:56:42,690 --> 00:56:45,610
- No, you didn't.
- [sighs]

1272
00:56:45,693 --> 00:56:48,530
Hey, how's your
Christmas going, kid?

1273
00:56:48,613 --> 00:56:50,281
It's okay, I guess.

1274
00:56:50,365 --> 00:56:54,285
- I'm trying to focus on gratitude.
- [confused grunts]

1275
00:56:54,369 --> 00:56:56,579
That's real low, Ralph.

1276
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:00,917
Hey, Mark,
you ever bar tend before?

1277
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,628
- I'm ten.
- Old enough. Come on back here.

1278
00:57:03,711 --> 00:57:05,213
Have some fun. Come on.

1279
00:57:07,590 --> 00:57:09,634
[dogs bark distantly]

1280
00:57:14,472 --> 00:57:15,557
Any in here?

1281
00:57:15,640 --> 00:57:17,350
Nope. Nothing.

1282
00:57:20,770 --> 00:57:22,897
[dog whimpers]

1283
00:57:26,985 --> 00:57:29,154
[gasps] Look at you.

1284
00:57:31,114 --> 00:57:32,532
Hey. Come with me.

1285
00:57:38,413 --> 00:57:39,831
[laughs]

1286
00:57:47,922 --> 00:57:49,048
What do you want?

1287
00:57:49,132 --> 00:57:51,467
I'm fixin' to feed the lobster.

1288
00:57:51,551 --> 00:57:52,760
I found your puppy.

1289
00:57:52,844 --> 00:57:55,430
She must have
gotten out somehow.

1290
00:57:55,513 --> 00:57:56,931
What's your angle?

1291
00:57:57,015 --> 00:58:00,768
If you want your adorable
little puppy back,

1292
00:58:01,477 --> 00:58:02,770
I want a reward.

1293
00:58:03,563 --> 00:58:05,565
What kinda reward?

1294
00:58:08,401 --> 00:58:09,444
There you go.

1295
00:58:09,527 --> 00:58:11,029
No way.

1296
00:58:11,112 --> 00:58:12,238
Yup.

1297
00:58:12,322 --> 00:58:13,406
You got it.
Just go right down there.

1298
00:58:13,489 --> 00:58:15,658
Hey, thanks, kid.
You're all right.

1299
00:58:15,742 --> 00:58:17,619
- [phone ringing]
- [all gasp]

1300
00:58:17,702 --> 00:58:19,871
Mark, answer it. Go on.

1301
00:58:22,040 --> 00:58:25,084
Hello? Mm-hm.

1302
00:58:25,168 --> 00:58:27,587
Hold on. Let me check.
Is Junior here?

1303
00:58:28,379 --> 00:58:30,173
Junior Kissel?

1304
00:58:30,256 --> 00:58:31,674
- Junior Kissel?
- [mouthing] No.

1305
00:58:33,176 --> 00:58:36,137
Junior Kissel?

1306
00:58:36,221 --> 00:58:37,722
- [mouthing] No?
- [mouthing] No.

1307
00:58:39,057 --> 00:58:40,225
No, I'm sorry, ma'am.

1308
00:58:40,308 --> 00:58:41,893
There's no one here
named Junior.

1309
00:58:42,977 --> 00:58:44,229
Mm-hm.

1310
00:58:44,312 --> 00:58:46,022
Merry Christmas to you, too.

1311
00:58:46,105 --> 00:58:47,190
[chuckles] Bye.

1312
00:58:47,273 --> 00:58:48,441
[whistles]

1313
00:58:48,524 --> 00:58:51,194
- Good job. You're great.
- [all cheering]

1314
00:58:51,277 --> 00:58:53,696
- He's great.
- Your kid's a natural.

1315
00:58:53,780 --> 00:58:55,073
Well done, kid.

1316
00:58:55,156 --> 00:58:56,741
- There you go.
- Wow.

1317
00:58:56,824 --> 00:58:59,786
Flick. Beer and a bag of
pork rinds. Put it on my tab.

1318
00:58:59,869 --> 00:59:01,246
No, out of pork rinds.

1319
00:59:01,329 --> 00:59:03,414
Jeez. What kind of bar
runs out of pork rinds?

1320
00:59:03,498 --> 00:59:06,167
Hey, you know, last week
they were out of corn nuts.

1321
00:59:06,251 --> 00:59:08,795
[all laughing]

1322
00:59:08,878 --> 00:59:12,131
It's the kind of bar that floats
a guy who runs up a big tab

1323
00:59:12,215 --> 00:59:14,300
while disrespecting the place.

1324
00:59:14,384 --> 00:59:16,427
Whoa. I don't like your tone.

1325
00:59:16,511 --> 00:59:18,471
[Ralphie]<i> Though he'd be</i>
<i>the last to admit it,</i>

1326
00:59:18,554 --> 00:59:20,765
<i>deep down somewhere
in his inner core,</i>

1327
00:59:20,848 --> 00:59:25,019
<i>Flick had it out for Schwartz since
that day on the playground long ago.</i>

1328
00:59:25,103 --> 00:59:27,814
And what kind of tone would
you prefer, Your Highness?

1329
00:59:27,897 --> 00:59:30,024
You know, you may be
a little more comfortable

1330
00:59:30,108 --> 00:59:32,277
down the street
at The Knight Cap.

1331
00:59:32,360 --> 00:59:34,362
- [all murmuring]
- The Knight Cap?

1332
00:59:34,445 --> 00:59:38,491
[Ralphie]<i> The Knight Cap?
Ugh. Dante's lowest circle of bars.</i>

1333
00:59:38,574 --> 00:59:40,285
The Knight Cap?

1334
00:59:41,619 --> 00:59:43,871
- Oh, you think?
- Yeah, maybe I do.

1335
00:59:43,955 --> 00:59:45,290
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

1336
00:59:45,373 --> 00:59:47,083
- Yeah? You're taking it back.
- Why would I?

1337
00:59:47,166 --> 00:59:48,334
I swear on my mother, Flick.

1338
00:59:48,418 --> 00:59:50,503
- You're taking it back!
- Oh, yeah?

1339
00:59:50,586 --> 00:59:51,796
Well, how about this?

1340
00:59:51,879 --> 00:59:54,716
I'll take it back
if you ride The Ramp.

1341
00:59:54,799 --> 00:59:55,717
[all exclaim]

1342
00:59:55,800 --> 00:59:57,427
[Ralphie]<i> The Ramp?</i>

1343
00:59:57,510 --> 00:59:59,721
<i>No one with half a brain
would agree to ride The Ramp.</i>

1344
00:59:59,804 --> 01:00:02,807
What, are you out of your
skull? I mean, I'm a grown man.

1345
01:00:02,890 --> 01:00:04,517
I ain't ridin' no ramp.

1346
01:00:04,600 --> 01:00:07,020
[Ralphie] <i>But Flick was
already two moves ahead.</i>

1347
01:00:07,103 --> 01:00:08,688
And...

1348
01:00:08,771 --> 01:00:12,191
- I'll clear your tab.
- [all] Ooh.

1349
01:00:12,275 --> 01:00:15,903
[Ralphie]<i> Poor Schwartz</i>
<i>was outmaneuvered.</i>

1350
01:00:15,987 --> 01:00:19,866
<i>Rather than lose face
with his fellow lowlifes,</i>

1351
01:00:19,949 --> 01:00:22,618
<i>Schwartz sealed his fate.</i>

1352
01:00:24,078 --> 01:00:25,621
- You're on.
- Okay.

1353
01:00:25,705 --> 01:00:27,540
[all exclaiming] -[Flick]
All right. Everybody out.

1354
01:00:27,623 --> 01:00:28,958
- [bell dinging]
- Dad, let's go!

1355
01:00:38,343 --> 01:00:40,178
[Ralphie]<i> The Ramp.</i>

1356

into a frosted sluice of terror.</i>

1358

<i>On The Ramp, you may as well
be riding in your coffin.</i>

1359
01:00:51,981 --> 01:00:53,941
- Holy...
- Yeah? What was that?

1360
01:00:54,025 --> 01:00:55,818
Huh? No. Nothing.

1361
01:00:55,902 --> 01:00:57,236
[boy] Here. It's your funeral.

1362
01:01:04,118 --> 01:01:05,411
He's gonna ride that?

1363
01:01:05,495 --> 01:01:06,746
Uh-huh.

What the hell are you
looking at? Stupid kids.

1366
01:01:12,043 --> 01:01:13,461
He's out of his mind.

1367
01:01:14,962 --> 01:01:16,255
[Flick] Keep going.

1368
01:01:16,339 --> 01:01:19,884
Keep going up that hill,
Schwartzy. Let's go!

1369
01:01:19,967 --> 01:01:21,761
It's getting cold!

1370
01:01:21,844 --> 01:01:23,262
What are you doing, man?

1371
01:01:23,346 --> 01:01:25,598
Oh, he's gonna chicken out.
Don't worry.

1372
01:01:27,850 --> 01:01:31,312
[panting] This is crazy.
This is crazy.

[exhales]

1374
01:01:33,022 --> 01:01:34,524

[Flick] Hey, you gonna go down,

1379
01:01:46,702 --> 01:01:48,621

and freeze our nuts off?

1382
01:01:57,964 --> 01:02:01,175
There's no way I'm gonna
kill myself for this. It's crazy!

1383
01:02:01,259 --> 01:02:02,552
Hey, Schwartz!

1384
01:02:02,635 --> 01:02:05,555

Oh, I got him now. I got him.

1390
01:02:23,072 --> 01:02:25,408
Okay. We should probably
move out of the way.

1391

[grunts]

1392
01:02:27,076 --> 01:02:28,453
Hey, hey, hey, Ralphie.

1393
01:02:29,328 --> 01:02:30,955
He's gonna be okay, right?

1394
01:02:33,958 --> 01:02:37,170
We should just probably
move out of the way.

1395
01:02:37,253 --> 01:02:39,255
[man] He's going to do it!
[woman] All right, let's go!

Schwartz!

- Schwartz.
- Schwartz.

1400
01:03:03,279 --> 01:03:04,530
- Schwartz, wake up.
- Schwartz, wake up.

1401

Schwartz. Schwartz.

1402
01:03:05,948 --> 01:03:07,867
- Is he alive?
- I think. I don't know.

1403
01:03:07,950 --> 01:03:09,327
- Schwartz, wake up, man.
- Schwartz.

1404

- [burps]
- [all groan]

1405
01:03:12,121 --> 01:03:13,414
The stink!

1406
01:03:15,208 --> 01:03:17,752
Uh... I thought we
lost you there, brother.

1407
01:03:17,835 --> 01:03:19,212
Did I do it?

1408
01:03:19,295 --> 01:03:20,922
- Did I clear my tab?
- [man] Yeah, come on, Flick!

1409
01:03:21,005 --> 01:03:23,174
Yeah, your tab is forgiven.

1410
01:03:23,257 --> 01:03:25,676
[all cheering]

1411
01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:27,762
- Let's get you home.
- Okay.

1412
01:03:27,845 --> 01:03:30,640
Wait, but first,
let's go get a drink.

1413
01:03:30,723 --> 01:03:32,725

It's so late.

1446

Everything go okay with Mark?

1447
01:04:48,551 --> 01:04:51,012
- More or less.
- That's good.

1448
01:04:51,095 --> 01:04:52,930
I took care of the presents.

1449
01:04:53,014 --> 01:04:54,181
Oh. Thank you.

You're welcome.

By the way...

01:05:06,944 --> 01:05:08,988
- Mark broke his arm.
- Hm?

<i>Sandy, on the other hand...</i>

1459
01:05:25,588 --> 01:05:30,259
Oh, um, I don't think
"bajillion" is actually a word.

1460
01:05:30,343 --> 01:05:32,345
Yes, it is.
You just used it in a sentence.

1461
01:05:32,428 --> 01:05:35,222
So, that's a double-word score,
a double-word score,

1462
01:05:35,306 --> 01:05:37,058
and a seven-tile bonus

1463
01:05:37,141 --> 01:05:40,686
which is 50 points.
So, just give me a second.

1464

122 points.

1465
01:05:45,941 --> 01:05:47,068
Wow.

Kids, you know, when
your father was your age,

01:05:54,992 --> 01:05:57,578
he had a similar
sort of problem,

1470

Really? What happened?

Well, he beat the snot
out of that kid. [laughs]

1474

- Wow!
- Daddy beat someone up?

1476
01:06:11,634 --> 01:06:14,053
Wait, that story is true?

1477
01:06:14,136 --> 01:06:15,971
Is it so hard to believe?

1478
01:06:16,055 --> 01:06:18,099
Huh. Ralph.

1479
01:06:18,182 --> 01:06:21,435
- Did he ever bother you again?
- Nope.

1480
01:06:22,978 --> 01:06:25,356
Hey, you guys gotta
get this figured out.

1481
01:06:25,439 --> 01:06:27,149
You can't just
be a target for 'em.

1482
01:06:30,277 --> 01:06:31,529
Armoire.

1483
01:06:31,612 --> 01:06:33,906
- That's not a word.
- Yes, it is.

1484
01:06:33,989 --> 01:06:35,825
It's just a fancy
word for "cabinet."

1485
01:06:35,908 --> 01:06:38,953
- You have one upstairs.
- I certainly do not.

1486
01:06:39,036 --> 01:06:42,998
In Indiana, we say "wardrobe."

1487
01:06:43,082 --> 01:06:46,043
- Come on, grab your coat.
- What for?

1488
01:06:46,127 --> 01:06:47,378
I have an idea.

1489
01:06:49,004 --> 01:06:50,381
"Arm." For five.

1490
01:06:50,464 --> 01:06:51,841
Oh, boy!

1491
01:06:51,924 --> 01:06:55,386
Five whole points for Sandy.

1492

Good for you.

1493
01:06:59,974 --> 01:07:01,892
It's hideous.

1494
01:07:01,976 --> 01:07:03,352

<i>- Yeah.</i>

to check in, um,

1502
01:07:30,045 --> 01:07:32,506
one last time, before Christmas.

1503

<i>No. Ralph.
Um, not interested in it.</i>

1504

Yes.

1510
01:07:59,408 --> 01:08:01,118
No. No.

1511
01:08:01,202 --> 01:08:06,248
That obituary is the hardest
damn thing I have ever had to write.

1512
01:08:06,332 --> 01:08:07,958
And I just found out why.

1513
01:08:08,042 --> 01:08:09,502
I'm no writer.

1514
01:08:09,585 --> 01:08:11,504
Just ask any publisher
in Chicago.

1515
01:08:12,254 --> 01:08:13,714
Nobody cares, Mom.

1516
01:08:13,798 --> 01:08:16,342
Nobody wants my book.
It's over.

1517
01:08:16,425 --> 01:08:19,929
- Oh, Ralphie.
- And an obituary?

1518
01:08:20,012 --> 01:08:23,766
How do you sum up a man's life
into a paragraph?

1519
01:08:25,893 --> 01:08:26,894
I can't do it.

1520
01:08:27,478 --> 01:08:28,729
Ralphie.

1521
01:08:29,522 --> 01:08:31,106
Ralphie, look at me.

1522
01:08:31,190 --> 01:08:36,153
Just forget about the
publishers and the paragraphs.

1523
01:08:36,237 --> 01:08:39,406
Forget about trying to write
the perfect words.

1524
01:08:40,324 --> 01:08:41,992

Your father certainly
wasn't perfect.

1527

I had to. I needed
that star for the tree

1699
01:19:31,600 --> 01:19:33,852
for my family for Christmas.

1700
01:19:33,935 --> 01:19:35,645
None of it makes any sense.

1701
01:19:35,729 --> 01:19:37,689
When we were kids,
life was simple.

1702
01:19:37,772 --> 01:19:41,693
It was all just fun and games.
Am I right?

1703
01:19:41,777 --> 01:19:43,737
Lots of laughs. [fake laugh]

1704
01:19:43,820 --> 01:19:45,989
Yeah, now I got some
devil spawn of my own,

1705
01:19:46,072 --> 01:19:49,868
running around all day
on that stupid snowmobile.

1706
01:19:52,078 --> 01:19:55,457
Between us... I think
they're worse than I ever was.

1707
01:19:55,540 --> 01:19:56,958
No. What are you talking about?

1708
01:19:57,042 --> 01:19:58,210
I mean, you...

1709
01:19:58,293 --> 01:20:00,337
You were great.

1710
01:20:00,420 --> 01:20:02,047
[Ralphie]<i> Oh, what was I saying?</i>

1711
01:20:02,130 --> 01:20:05,467
<i>My mind was mush.
My dying words were lies!</i>

1712
01:20:05,550 --> 01:20:06,801
<i>All lies!</i>

1713
01:20:06,885 --> 01:20:08,720
[man on radio]
<i>Farkus. Come in, Farkus.</i>

1714
01:20:08,804 --> 01:20:10,889
<i>- What's your 20? Can you hear me?</i>
- [turns off radio]

1715
01:20:10,972 --> 01:20:13,058
[Ralphie]<i> Oh, no!</i>
<i>How would he do it?</i>

1716
01:20:13,141 --> 01:20:14,935
<i>Death by a thousand cuts?
Buried alive?</i>

1717
01:20:15,018 --> 01:20:16,895
<i>Medieval chin breaker?
Burned at the stake?</i>

1718
01:20:16,978 --> 01:20:19,564
<i>Steam rolled? Pool of piranhas?</i>

1719
01:20:19,648 --> 01:20:20,899
End of the road, Parker.

1720
01:20:20,982 --> 01:20:22,567
<i>Oh, no! This was it!</i>

1721
01:20:22,651 --> 01:20:24,152
<i>Kiss my sweet ass...</i>

1722
01:20:24,236 --> 01:20:25,820
This is home, right?

1723
01:20:27,405 --> 01:20:28,657
[dog barking]

1724
01:20:28,740 --> 01:20:31,201
Yeah, this is home.

1725
01:20:41,920 --> 01:20:43,588
Breaking into Flick's dump, huh?

1726
01:20:43,672 --> 01:20:45,715
You must've really
needed that star.

1727
01:20:45,799 --> 01:20:48,260
Yeah, I did.

1728
01:20:48,343 --> 01:20:52,347
Look, I appreciate you blowing
smoke up my dress like you did,

1729
01:20:52,430 --> 01:20:54,933
but we both know
when we were kids...

1730
01:20:55,016 --> 01:20:56,434
I was kind of a nightmare.

1731
01:20:56,518 --> 01:20:57,769
[Ralphie]<i> Kinda?</i>

1732
01:20:57,853 --> 01:21:00,230
I was just trying
to be a tough guy, you know?

1733
01:21:00,313 --> 01:21:02,190
Like my old man.

1734
01:21:02,274 --> 01:21:06,778
But that day you handed my ass
to me... I mean, that got me thinkin'.

1735
01:21:06,862 --> 01:21:09,030
[Ralphie]
<i>Not sure where this is going.</i>

1736
01:21:09,114 --> 01:21:12,617
You know, I put all
that garbage behind me.

1737
01:21:12,701 --> 01:21:13,743
And look at me now.

1738
01:21:15,245 --> 01:21:17,622
I'm one of the good guys.

1739
01:21:17,706 --> 01:21:19,791
So I guess what I'm saying is...

1740
01:21:19,875 --> 01:21:20,959
I owe you, Parker.

1741
01:21:28,091 --> 01:21:28,925
Hey.

1742
01:21:34,014 --> 01:21:35,098
Merry Christmas, Ralph.

1743
01:21:36,516 --> 01:21:37,809
Merry Christmas, Scut.

1744
01:21:42,731 --> 01:21:45,984
You know, if anyone else but me
had answered that call,

1745
01:21:46,067 --> 01:21:49,070
you'd be rotting
in a jail cell all weekend.

1746
01:21:49,154 --> 01:21:50,322
How about that?

1747
01:21:50,947 --> 01:21:52,073
[laughs]

1748
01:22:06,588 --> 01:22:07,714
[siren wails]

1749
01:22:14,763 --> 01:22:15,639
[exhales]

1750
01:22:29,944 --> 01:22:32,697
[Mrs. Parker] Oh, Ralphie.
You found a star.

1751
01:22:33,448 --> 01:22:34,491
Yeah.

1752
01:22:43,458 --> 01:22:45,585
I miss him, Ma.

1753
01:22:45,669 --> 01:22:47,170
[Mrs. Parker] I miss him, too.

1754
01:22:49,464 --> 01:22:50,965
But I know he's here.

1755
01:22:54,886 --> 01:22:56,805
- [Ralphie groans]
- [Mrs. Parker sighs]

1756
01:22:56,888 --> 01:23:00,392
- [Ralphie] I'll get the fuse.
- No. No. You go to bed.

1757
01:23:00,475 --> 01:23:04,062
I've gotta learn to do these
things on my own from now on.

1758
01:23:04,145 --> 01:23:05,647
- I'll be fine.
- Okay.

1759
01:23:05,730 --> 01:23:07,357
Okay, so, go. Go on.

1760
01:23:07,440 --> 01:23:09,317
- I'm going up.
- Okay. All right.

1761
01:23:09,401 --> 01:23:10,443
Be careful, Ma.

1762
01:23:10,527 --> 01:23:11,653
Good night, Ralphie.

1763
01:23:11,736 --> 01:23:12,779
Good night.

1764
01:23:15,323 --> 01:23:16,574
[footsteps running]

1765
01:23:16,658 --> 01:23:18,034
[both] Wake up!

1766
01:23:18,118 --> 01:23:19,703
[screaming]

1767
01:23:19,786 --> 01:23:21,746
- Come on, it's Christmas!
- There's presents under the tree!

1768
01:23:21,830 --> 01:23:24,040
We have to go see! Come on!

1769
01:23:24,124 --> 01:23:25,959
- Okay, we're up, we're up.
- Okay, okay.

1770
01:23:26,042 --> 01:23:27,919
- Hurry up!
- Faster!

1771
01:23:29,546 --> 01:23:31,047
[gasps] Look, Julie!

1772
01:23:31,131 --> 01:23:33,425
[screams] Daddy, Daddy,
you did it!

1773
01:23:33,508 --> 01:23:36,261
- You got the star and Santa came!
- [Mark] Look at it!

1774
01:23:36,344 --> 01:23:38,680
- Is that a beer logo?
- [Mark] Awesome.

1775
01:23:38,763 --> 01:23:40,306
Don't ask.

1776
01:23:40,390 --> 01:23:43,059
- [laughs] Oh. Merry Christmas.
- [Sandy] Oh. Merry Christmas.

1777
01:23:43,143 --> 01:23:44,936
- Merry Christmas, Ma.
- [Mark] He ate the cookies!

1778
01:23:45,019 --> 01:23:47,313
- Good morning.
- [Julie] And the stockings are full!

1779
01:23:47,397 --> 01:23:49,691
- [both] Wow.
- Did you get extra presents?

1780
01:23:49,774 --> 01:23:51,234
No. Did you?

1781
01:23:51,317 --> 01:23:52,152
No.

1782
01:23:53,111 --> 01:23:55,238
"For Ralph. Love, Dad."

1783
01:23:56,030 --> 01:23:57,031
Oh.

1784
01:23:59,993 --> 01:24:02,287
"For Julie. Love, Grandpa."

1785
01:24:02,370 --> 01:24:03,246
[gasps]

1786
01:24:05,874 --> 01:24:07,459
Mom, these are all from Dad.

1787
01:24:08,376 --> 01:24:09,627
Yeah.

1788
01:24:09,711 --> 01:24:12,380
Last night, when I was
down in the basement

1789
01:24:12,464 --> 01:24:14,632
fixing the fuse, I found them.

1790
01:24:15,884 --> 01:24:20,096
He must've got them before.

1791
01:24:22,724 --> 01:24:25,810
Yeah. [chuckles] He did good.

1792
01:24:25,894 --> 01:24:27,145
[Ralphie] Yeah.

1793
01:24:28,730 --> 01:24:31,941
- [laughs] Well, come on! Let's open gifts!
- [Ralphie] Yeah!

1794
01:24:32,025 --> 01:24:35,487
[Ralphie]<i> Each of us, in turn,
opened the gifts from my old man,</i>

1795
01:24:35,570 --> 01:24:37,989
<i>marveling at their
thoughtful perfection.</i>

1796
01:24:38,072 --> 01:24:39,616
An Easy-Bake Oven!

1797
01:24:39,699 --> 01:24:42,076
- I can make Christmas cookies today!
- [Ralphie] Yeah!

1798
01:24:42,160 --> 01:24:43,495
It even has a pom-pom.

1799
01:24:43,578 --> 01:24:45,497
- [Ralphie] Wow.
- Really pretty.

1800
01:24:45,580 --> 01:24:47,999
- It is soft.
- Yeah.

1801
01:24:48,082 --> 01:24:49,667
- [Sandy] Ah...
- Fountain pen.

1802
01:24:49,751 --> 01:24:52,045
- Oh, lovely.
- Wow.

1803
01:24:52,754 --> 01:24:53,588
Wow!

1804
01:24:54,297 --> 01:24:56,132
[chuckles]

1805
01:24:56,216 --> 01:24:59,511
A Flexible Flyer F-23
Yankee Clipper!

1806
01:24:59,594 --> 01:25:00,804
How did he know?

1807
01:25:00,887 --> 01:25:03,723
He knows. He always knows.

1808
01:25:03,807 --> 01:25:07,560
<i>And right when it seemed the
only thing missing was the old man,</i>

1809
01:25:07,644 --> 01:25:12,232
<i>he was here, just like
always, on Christmas morning.</i>

1810
01:25:14,150 --> 01:25:16,402
[Ralphie] Whoa! Look at that.
[Sandy] Oh, you are...

1811
01:25:16,486 --> 01:25:18,196
Oh, boy.

1812
01:25:18,279 --> 01:25:20,156
[Ralphie]<i> We tore into the
remaining presents with abandon.</i>

1813
01:25:20,240 --> 01:25:23,159
See, now your papa can't
hit you in the eyes anymore.

1814
01:25:23,243 --> 01:25:24,744
It was an accident.

1815
01:25:24,828 --> 01:25:26,955
[Ralphie]<i> Some were from</i>
<i>Mom's stockings from Santa,</i>

1816
01:25:27,038 --> 01:25:30,583
<i>and the rest from Sandy's
ingenious use of our remaining cash.</i>

1817
01:25:30,667 --> 01:25:31,876
It's a party calendar.

1818
01:25:31,960 --> 01:25:33,419
[Ralphie] Disco.
[Sandy] Disco.

1819
01:25:33,503 --> 01:25:35,088
[Mrs. Parker] Disco. Yeah.
[Ralphie] Look at that.

1820
01:25:37,131 --> 01:25:39,551
<i>No one cared how much
they cost, because...</i>

1821
01:25:39,634 --> 01:25:42,178
<i>and I can't believe
I'm admitting this,</i>

1822
01:25:42,262 --> 01:25:44,180
<i>it was the thought that counts.</i>

1823
01:25:44,264 --> 01:25:46,808
[Sandy] He's gonna break his other
arm, too. [Ralphie] Yeah. He just might.

1824
01:25:46,891 --> 01:25:49,894
- And, Dad, I have something for you.
- Oh.

1825
01:25:49,978 --> 01:25:51,396
[chuckles]

1826
01:25:51,479 --> 01:25:53,356
- Ooh.
- The gifts are great.

1827
01:25:53,439 --> 01:25:55,149
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

1828
01:25:55,233 --> 01:25:57,318
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

1829
01:25:58,736 --> 01:25:59,988
[Mrs. Parker] Oh.

1830
01:26:00,071 --> 01:26:02,740
- [laughing]
- [Sandy] What?

1831
01:26:03,658 --> 01:26:05,493
Oh. A radiator.

1832
01:26:05,577 --> 01:26:07,745
- Where did you...
- I blackmailed Delbert.

1833
01:26:07,829 --> 01:26:10,540
- It was easy.
- [chuckles] That's my girl.

1834
01:26:12,584 --> 01:26:14,127
Thank you, sweetheart.

1835
01:26:14,210 --> 01:26:16,045
I love it.

1836
01:26:16,129 --> 01:26:18,923
- [Ralphie]<i> Delbert Bumpus. The gift that keeps on giving.</i>
- Oh, my God.

1837
01:26:25,889 --> 01:26:27,348
I can't wait.

1838
01:26:27,432 --> 01:26:29,183
Me neither.

1839
01:26:29,267 --> 01:26:31,686
[Mrs. Parker] Not until
the casseroles are finished.

1840
01:26:31,769 --> 01:26:33,104
[groans]

1841
01:26:33,187 --> 01:26:35,607
[laughs] Come on, let's go.
Two plates, two forks.

1842
01:26:35,690 --> 01:26:37,192
- Off you go.
- You serious?

1843
01:26:37,275 --> 01:26:39,193
I'm serious.
Out you go. Come on.

1844
01:26:39,277 --> 01:26:40,778
Put some meat
on those bones. Go on.

1845
01:26:40,862 --> 01:26:42,488
- [Julie] It never ends.
- I know, I know.

1846
01:26:47,744 --> 01:26:48,870
[Sandy sighs]

1847
01:26:51,247 --> 01:26:54,208
You know, I've been thinking.

1848
01:26:54,292 --> 01:26:56,961
I mean, a year, it really
isn't that much time.

1849
01:26:57,045 --> 01:26:59,839
- And to build a writing career...
- No, honey.

1850
01:27:00,548 --> 01:27:01,841
A deal's a deal.

1851
01:27:01,925 --> 01:27:03,551
And it was a real gift.

1852
01:27:03,635 --> 01:27:06,471
But come January,
I'm going back to work.

1853
01:27:07,096 --> 01:27:08,306
And that's okay.

1854
01:27:09,474 --> 01:27:10,642
Okay.

1855
01:27:31,955 --> 01:27:36,334
[Ralphie] <i>It wasn't the lack
of success that bothered me.</i>

1856
01:27:36,417 --> 01:27:38,878
<i>It was the sting
that laid in the belief</i>

1857
01:27:38,962 --> 01:27:42,173
<i>that I still had something
meaningful to say.</i>

1858
01:27:44,717 --> 01:27:45,885
[woman] Ralphie!

1859
01:27:46,886 --> 01:27:48,137
Great job!

1860
01:27:50,598 --> 01:27:51,808
Okay.

1861
01:27:57,021 --> 01:27:58,356
[man] Hey, Ralphie!

1862
01:27:58,439 --> 01:27:59,857
The wife and I loved your story.

1863
01:28:00,817 --> 01:28:01,859
The newspaper.

1864
01:28:03,444 --> 01:28:04,487
It's great!

1865
01:28:30,388 --> 01:28:32,557
It's my story.

1866
01:28:32,640 --> 01:28:34,434
How did they get my story?

1867
01:28:34,517 --> 01:28:35,560
Don't look at me.

1868
01:28:38,062 --> 01:28:39,731
I gave it to 'em.

1869
01:28:39,814 --> 01:28:41,566
What are you talking about?

1870
01:28:41,649 --> 01:28:43,985
Well, last night, after you
stormed out, the newspaper called.

1871
01:28:44,068 --> 01:28:46,446
They wanted the obituary
for the Sunday paper.

1872
01:28:46,529 --> 01:28:49,949
So, I borrowed your mom's car
and I dropped it off.

1873
01:28:50,033 --> 01:28:51,367
It's not an obituary.

1874
01:28:51,451 --> 01:28:55,121
No, I know.
The editor said the same thing.

1875
01:28:55,204 --> 01:28:59,208
Ralph, I read it. It's the
best thing you've ever written.

1876
01:29:01,377 --> 01:29:02,962
And besides,
I wasn't about to give them

1877
01:29:03,046 --> 01:29:06,382
the lousy three sentences
you scribbled on that notepad.

1878
01:29:06,466 --> 01:29:08,468
- [phone ringing]
- Oh, I'll get it.

1879
01:29:10,553 --> 01:29:13,181
Hello? Yes.

1880
01:29:13,264 --> 01:29:14,682
Yes, he's here.

1881
01:29:14,766 --> 01:29:15,767
It's for you.

1882
01:29:15,850 --> 01:29:16,768
Who is it?

1883
01:29:16,851 --> 01:29:18,811
It's the editor from the paper.

1884
01:29:25,234 --> 01:29:26,235
Hello?

1885
01:29:27,361 --> 01:29:28,279
Uh-huh.

1886
01:29:29,072 --> 01:29:30,156
Yes.

1887
01:29:30,239 --> 01:29:32,742
Yes, I do. All right.

1888
01:29:34,368 --> 01:29:36,579
Okay. Mm-hm.

1889
01:29:39,373 --> 01:29:40,458
Thank you.

1890
01:29:46,422 --> 01:29:48,591
Well, what did he say?

1891
01:29:51,511 --> 01:29:54,263
He wants to know
if I have more stories.

1892
01:29:59,185 --> 01:30:00,353
Ralph...

1893
01:30:01,562 --> 01:30:03,064
You did it.

1894
01:30:03,147 --> 01:30:05,233
I did it. I did it!

1895
01:30:05,316 --> 01:30:07,318
- [all laughing]
- I did it.

1896
01:30:08,820 --> 01:30:11,030
<i>I did. I actually did it!</i>

1897
01:30:11,114 --> 01:30:13,991
<i>I was a bona fide
published writer!</i>

1898
01:30:14,075 --> 01:30:15,409
<i>And they wanted more!</i>

1899
01:30:15,493 --> 01:30:18,621
- [indistinct chatter]
- [knocking on door]

1900
01:30:18,704 --> 01:30:21,916
- I'll get it!
- He also said it's gonna be syndicated.

1901
01:30:21,999 --> 01:30:23,334
- What?
- What does that mean?

1902
01:30:23,417 --> 01:30:25,336
It means it's going
in all the papers.

1903
01:30:25,419 --> 01:30:27,004
- Even in Chicago?
- Yeah.

1904
01:30:27,088 --> 01:30:29,507
Come on. Let's go read it!

1905
01:30:29,590 --> 01:30:32,009
- Ralph.
- [Julie] Wait for me!

1906
01:30:32,093 --> 01:30:34,387
- Thank you, honey.
- Of course.

1907
01:30:34,470 --> 01:30:37,265
- [Mrs. Parker] Ralphie, you have visitors.
- Go, go, go!

1908
01:30:37,348 --> 01:30:38,683
- Okay. Okay.
- Go!

1909
01:30:38,766 --> 01:30:39,976
Who is it, Ma?

1910
01:30:40,059 --> 01:30:42,770
There he is!
Hohman's own Ray Bradbury!

1911
01:30:42,854 --> 01:30:44,647
Oh, man! Good job.

1912
01:30:44,730 --> 01:30:47,733
- Hey! Yeah, good stuff, man.
- Thanks, buddy.

1913
01:30:47,817 --> 01:30:48,985
Mom loved it.

1914
01:30:49,068 --> 01:30:50,653
- Had me read it to her twice.
- Wow.

1915
01:30:50,736 --> 01:30:53,030
- Thanks for the story, Ralph.
- Hey, Larry.

1916
01:30:53,114 --> 01:30:55,449
Great excuse to get
out of the house.

1917
01:30:55,533 --> 01:30:56,617
- Yeah.
- Oh, yeah.

1918
01:30:56,701 --> 01:30:59,036
How do you feel about casserole?

1919
01:30:59,120 --> 01:31:01,289
- I love it.
- You must be hungry.

1920
01:31:01,372 --> 01:31:02,373
Casserole.

1921
01:31:02,456 --> 01:31:03,541
- Let's eat!
- Come on.

1922
01:31:03,624 --> 01:31:05,877
Merry Christmas, everybody!

1923
01:31:05,960 --> 01:31:09,088
[Ralphie]<i> As the word spread, it seemed
like half the neighborhood showed up.</i>

1924
01:31:09,172 --> 01:31:11,883
<i>My mother welcomed them
with open arms...</i>

1925
01:31:11,966 --> 01:31:14,093

weren't carolers.</i>

1926
01:31:14,177 --> 01:31:15,970

- Ralph.

[indistinct chatter]

1928
01:31:18,973 --> 01:31:20,850
- No, it's not true.
- Officer Farkus...

1929
01:31:20,933 --> 01:31:22,393
Hey! What's all the fuss?

1930
01:31:22,476 --> 01:31:23,895
[all] Oh, Randy!

1931
01:31:24,770 --> 01:31:26,731
- Randy!
- Mom!

1932
01:31:28,691 --> 01:31:30,151
Oh.

1933
01:31:30,234 --> 01:31:32,278
- Hey! Merry Christmas, big brother.
- You made it.

1934
01:31:32,361 --> 01:31:34,572
Yeah. A cracker?

1935
01:31:34,655 --> 01:31:36,073
Mm-hm.

1936
01:31:36,157 --> 01:31:39,368
- [both] Uncle Randy!
- Hey, runts! How are you doing?

1937
01:31:39,452 --> 01:31:41,078
Good to see you.
Good to see you.

1938
01:31:41,162 --> 01:31:43,122
Hey, why don't you go check out
that suitcase over there.

1939
01:31:43,206 --> 01:31:45,416
I picked up some gifts
along the way.

1940
01:31:45,500 --> 01:31:46,709
- Sandy!
- Randy!

1941
01:31:46,792 --> 01:31:49,086
- Hey.
- Hey. Merry Christmas.

1942
01:31:49,170 --> 01:31:51,797
[gasps] It's the stuffed cat
I wanted!

1943
01:31:51,881 --> 01:31:52,798
Oh.

1944
01:31:52,882 --> 01:31:55,259
Cool! A saber.

1945
01:31:55,343 --> 01:31:56,594
- Awesome!
- Oh.

1946
01:31:56,677 --> 01:31:58,429
[Mrs. Parker] No, no, no.

1947
01:31:58,512 --> 01:32:00,598
[sniffs] What's that smell?

1948
01:32:00,681 --> 01:32:02,058
Casserole. Come on, let's eat.

1949
01:32:02,141 --> 01:32:03,434
- What, on Christmas?
- Let's go. Go.

1950
01:32:03,518 --> 01:32:05,269
Come on. We need some dishes.

1951
01:32:05,353 --> 01:32:08,814
Extra chairs. Come on,
everybody. Come on.

'round, rolled up their sleeves,</i>

their belts a notch.</i>
