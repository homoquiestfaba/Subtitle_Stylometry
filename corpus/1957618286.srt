00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:11,000
- [Principal] Valedictorian,
Alex Gatewood.

00:00:12,122 --> 00:00:15,289
(audience applauding)

3
00:00:20,977 --> 00:00:24,000
(Alex sighing)

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,483
- Today, the day of our graduation,

5
00:00:29,748 --> 00:00:32,610
it is not only a high
school which we leave today,

6
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:34,490
it's adolescence.

7
00:00:34,490 --> 00:00:38,113
The road that lies ahead of
each of us is a different one.

8
00:00:39,108 --> 00:00:42,275
(crickets screeching)

9
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:45,310
We must each take what we've learned,

10
00:00:45,310 --> 00:00:47,023
and use it to guide us through.

11
00:00:55,846 --> 00:01:00,846
(gunshots booming)
(somber music)

12
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:14,927

13
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:27,760
(car honking)

14
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:57,760
- [Megan] Michael, I hope
this letter finds you,

15
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:00,243
I need your help, we're selling the farm.

16
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:04,023
Come home, 18 years is
an awfully long time.

17
00:02:05,416 --> 00:02:06,343
We miss you.

Hi.

53
00:06:12,443 --> 00:06:13,276
- Hi.

54
00:06:16,491 --> 00:06:17,741
- I missed you.

55
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:26,970
Did you get my letter?
- Yeah, yeah.

56
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:28,100
- I didn't know where to send it to,

57
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:31,563
I didn't, I didn't think you'd get it.

58
00:06:50,889 --> 00:06:52,906
- Hey Megs.
(Megan laughing)

59
00:06:52,906 --> 00:06:54,760
- How are ya?
- How are you?

60
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:56,447
- Hey Philly.
- Michael!

61
00:06:56,447 --> 00:06:58,030
- [Phil] Hi Carrie.

62
00:06:58,933 --> 00:07:01,223
- It's so good to see you.

63
00:07:01,223 --> 00:07:04,950
- Ada, you're gonna freeze.
- Hey Phil.

64
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:06,327
- Hey Michael, how have you been?

65
00:07:06,327 --> 00:07:08,423
It's been a while man.
- Yeah.

66
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:10,740
- You like this, I did it myself.

67
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:12,844
- Yeah, I could tell.

68
00:07:12,844 --> 00:07:14,470
- What about you man, you look like shit.

69
00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:15,760
New York doing that to you?

70
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:16,707
- Thanks.

71
00:07:16,707 --> 00:07:19,103
- Give him a break, he's
been driving for two days.

72
00:07:19,103 --> 00:07:21,070
- It's like I said, he looks like shit.

73
00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:23,263
- How long are you gonna
be staying with us.

74
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:25,613
- Just a couple days.

75
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:29,960
- Did you bring those boxes?

76
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:32,149
- Sure did, sure you're
gonna need all of 'em?

77
00:07:32,149 --> 00:07:34,710
- I don't know, Marcia said
whatever we don't pack,

78
00:07:34,710 --> 00:07:36,073
she's given away so.

79
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:42,823
- So is Ray coming?
- Yeah, he's invited.

80
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:46,230
Excellent, excellent,
excellent, oh two sizes too.

81
00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:47,063
- Yeah, yip.

82
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:51,307
- So why are you selling this place?

83
00:07:51,307 --> 00:07:53,213
- My dad and Marcia got divorced.

84
00:07:56,290 --> 00:07:58,640
- Phil, come here, help me out, will ya?

85
00:07:58,640 --> 00:07:59,473
- Yeah.

86
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,550
Yeah.
- Thanks.

87
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:05,360
- Stop fucking around.

88
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,434
- Here, I could take some more.

89
00:08:06,434 --> 00:08:07,267
- Take these, and I'd take these two.

90
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:10,960
Oh great.
- Got it?

91
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:11,793
- Yeah.
- You okay?

92
00:08:11,793 --> 00:08:13,663
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Oh sorry.

93
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:18,840
- Last summer was pretty fucking ugly.

94
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:20,173
Marcia got the whole farm.

95
00:08:23,910 --> 00:08:26,210
Oh god, why am I carrying this?

96
00:08:26,210 --> 00:08:27,761
No, it's okay, got it, got it.

97
00:08:27,761 --> 00:08:29,648
Can you just bring the rest?
- Yeah.

98
00:08:29,648 --> 00:08:31,340
I gotta get my stuff out of the trunk.

99
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:32,550
- Okay.

100
00:08:32,550 --> 00:08:35,593
Hey, I'm glad you came.

101
00:08:36,798 --> 00:08:37,631
You look good.

102
00:08:39,671 --> 00:08:40,754
Phil!
- Great.

103
00:08:44,563 --> 00:08:47,230
- Here, take these, I gotta pee.

104
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:50,749
- Carrie!

105
00:08:50,749 --> 00:08:51,582
Shit!

106
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:10,130
Oh whoa, why?
- When did you get this?

107
00:09:10,130 --> 00:09:11,060
- I've had it for a while.

108
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:14,803
- Wow, thanks for calling.
- I'm sorry.

109
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:17,930
- Hey Megan.
- Hi Ray.

110
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:24,080
Thanks for coming.
- Yeah, it's no problem.

111
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,480
- Well, let's go for a ride.

112
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:30,733
- Hey ray.
- Mike.

113
00:09:33,301 --> 00:09:34,551
- How you been?

114
00:09:37,377 --> 00:09:39,197
- You know, same as always.

115
00:09:41,595 --> 00:09:44,678
Are you holdin' on?
- Yeah, I sure am.

116
00:10:00,774 --> 00:10:05,331
- You're gonna kill
yourself with that thing!

117
00:10:05,331 --> 00:10:07,250
- (laughs) How was your drive?

118
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:09,100
- I came with Phil, what do you think?

119
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:11,483
- [Megan] Totally, which one do you want?

120
00:10:11,483 --> 00:10:14,996
- Oh yeah.

121
00:10:14,996 --> 00:10:16,440
- [Carrie] Pig.

122
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,540
- We'll take this one.

123
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:22,230
- You feed the fuckers once,
and they never leave you alone.

124
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,717
Stop it, Jesus.

125
00:10:26,862 --> 00:10:29,695
(gunshot booming)

126
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:33,883
- Oh god.

127
00:10:52,810 --> 00:10:57,500
Look, I know you don't understand why.

128
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:59,550
- You ain't gotta explain it to me, okay.

129
00:11:00,890 --> 00:11:02,590
- No, you're right I don't, but I'm--

130
00:11:02,590 --> 00:11:04,433
- Why don't we just leave it at that.

131
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,480
- I mean if that's what you want,

132
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,980
I guess we just, we won't
talk to each other then.

133
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:21,833
- Why did you come back?
- Why are you here, Ray?

134
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:25,800
- I'm not the one who ran away.

135
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:28,383
- You don't understand.
- What's to understand?

136
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:30,973
It's pretty clear how you feel.

137
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:33,090
- What do you mean?

138
00:11:35,510 --> 00:11:39,190
- You didn't even stay for the funeral.

139
00:11:39,190 --> 00:11:40,023
- No I didn't.

140
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:44,473
- He was your friend.
(crowd laughing)

141
00:11:47,630 --> 00:11:48,463
- He was dead.

142
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:51,490
- So are you surprised that he came?

143
00:11:51,490 --> 00:11:52,323
- Who?

144
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,940
No.

145
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:57,190
- He looks good, doesn't he?
- I don't know.

146
00:11:57,190 --> 00:11:58,913
He looks different.

147
00:12:00,290 --> 00:12:01,223
You look good.

148
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:04,190
So I haven't talked to in awhile.

149
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:05,310
- I know.

150
00:12:05,310 --> 00:12:07,010
Sorry, it's been really crazy.

151
00:12:07,010 --> 00:12:08,210
- I know I've been busy.

152
00:12:09,330 --> 00:12:11,453
Well, how are you?
- Good.

153
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:16,930
So you and Phil are living together now?

154
00:12:16,930 --> 00:12:18,960
- Oh my god, no.

155
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:21,523
He wishes, he got kicked
out of his apartment.

156
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:23,580
- Again?

157
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:25,170
- That's what happens when
you don't pay the rent

158
00:12:25,170 --> 00:12:26,850
for three months.

159
00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:28,960
- Oh, so you let him move in with you.

160
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,133
- Temporarily.

161
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,193
He cooks.

162
00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:39,740
Meg?
- Mm-hmm (affirmative).

163
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:42,000
- Don't expect too much, okay.

164
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,760
- What do you mean?

165
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,870
- It's just that you
always expect so much,

166
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:47,650
you get your hopes up and
then you get let down,

167
00:12:47,650 --> 00:12:48,800
I don't wanna see you hurt,

168
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:53,050
and the fact that everyone
showed up is already amazing.

169
00:12:53,050 --> 00:12:55,093
- I know.
- Okay.

170
00:12:59,770 --> 00:13:00,603
It's just that,

171
00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:04,170
you know I feel like we've all quit,

172
00:13:04,170 --> 00:13:07,990
and I can't just, well, it
can't be because of Alex.

173
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:09,240
- This isn't a good idea.

174
00:13:10,519 --> 00:13:12,643
- You know, it's kind of
morbid if you think about it.

175
00:13:12,643 --> 00:13:13,803
A last goodbye.

176
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:17,820
I mean it is what you guys
think is going on here, right?

177
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:18,770
That's really sick.

178
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:22,410
- You seem to have it all figured out.

179
00:13:22,410 --> 00:13:25,200
- Yeah well, when it
comes to you two, I do.

180
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,480
I mean you guys are fucking
better than "Bonanza".

181
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:29,930
It's classic, I mean you
run away, you stay mad,

182
00:13:29,930 --> 00:13:32,090
now you're both back here to battle out.

183
00:13:32,090 --> 00:13:35,660
Megan's master plan is
coming together very nice.

184
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:37,080
- Her master plan?

185
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:39,460
- She's pretty smart, I mean think about,

186
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:41,610
she managed to get you
back in town, right?

187
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:45,460
You guys are so pathetic.

188
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:48,110
- You know you've become very
observant in your free time,

189
00:13:48,110 --> 00:13:50,250
I guess flunking out was
a good thing for you.

190
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:52,293
- Yeah and you used to be a lot of fun.

191
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,073
Lighten up.

192
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:59,120
- Here, I thought you
guys might want these.

193
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,033
- Thanks.

194
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:06,093
- Hey.

195
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,540
You sure your husband's not gonna mind

196
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:12,610
me sleeping on the sofa
when you get married.

197
00:14:12,610 --> 00:14:14,850
- You think I'd introduce you
to somebody I was gonna marry?

198
00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:16,340
- You're just saying
that, 'cause you love me.

199
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:18,363
- Yeah, get the groceries out of my car.

200
00:14:21,330 --> 00:14:23,343
- Come on guys, let's go bond.

201
00:14:25,117 --> 00:14:26,850
- You know I remember
that I just had plans,

202
00:14:26,850 --> 00:14:28,963
but I'll try and get around it, it's okay.

203
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:34,940
No, yeah, that sounds
great, we'll work it out,

204
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:36,253
Friday night?
- Who's she talking to?

205
00:14:38,113 --> 00:14:39,520
Who you talking to?
- Fuck off.

206
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:41,930
No, nothing, no, sure it sounds great.

207
00:14:41,930 --> 00:14:42,800
I'd love to.

208
00:14:44,926 --> 00:14:46,730
- [Megan] Hey, when do you
guys turn on that pump?

209
00:14:46,730 --> 00:14:48,453
- Yeah, I'll get it.
- No.

210
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:50,470
- What time is the game on tonight?

211
00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:52,610
- I don't know, seven.

212
00:14:52,610 --> 00:14:53,530
- [Phil] This is the year.

213
00:14:53,530 --> 00:14:54,972
- You say the same thing every year.

214
00:14:54,972 --> 00:14:55,910
- Yeah, but this year is different.

215
00:14:55,910 --> 00:14:57,950
- I gave up a long time ago.

216
00:14:57,950 --> 00:14:59,640
- It's too frustrating
to be a Houston fan.

217
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:01,443
- [Phil] You guys ain't got no faith.

218
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,150
- You want me to do that?
- I think I can handle it,

219
00:15:07,150 --> 00:15:10,490
I'm not a total fuck-up.
- Yeah, don't bet on it.

220
00:15:10,490 --> 00:15:11,323
I heard that.

221
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,450
Give me one of these.
- It's still warm.

222
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:21,313
It's okay, cold beer makes me fart.

223
00:15:22,430 --> 00:15:23,963
- [Ray] You know what
the fuck you're doing?

224
00:15:25,070 --> 00:15:25,903
All right!

225
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:35,570
- I hope they don't argue all weekend.

226
00:15:35,570 --> 00:15:37,920
- Guys don't argue, they compete.

227
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:40,040
It's a penis thing.
(Megan laughing)

228
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:41,713
Works as compensation I guess.

229
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:44,090
- So, who's more competitive?

230
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:46,113
- [Both] Ray!

231
00:15:47,172 --> 00:15:48,610
- Definitely Ray.

232
00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:50,683
- So that means Michael got the bigger.

233
00:15:51,526 --> 00:15:53,930
- What, you don't know?

234
00:15:53,930 --> 00:15:56,993
- He was Alex's best friend.
- So?

235
00:15:58,430 --> 00:16:00,948
- I never would have cheated on Alex.

236
00:16:00,948 --> 00:16:01,798
- What about now?

237
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:11,630
It's too bad, he's got a great ass.

238
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:12,717
Maybe I'll do him.

239
00:16:16,216 --> 00:16:20,230
You know, it could be
possible that Michael

240
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:23,607
and Ray have latent homosexual
feelings for each other.

241
00:16:23,607 --> 00:16:26,010
Can you imagine those two making out?

242
00:16:26,010 --> 00:16:28,953
- No.
(both laughing)

243
00:16:34,314 --> 00:16:35,147
- What?

244
00:16:36,842 --> 00:16:37,818
What?

245
00:16:37,818 --> 00:16:39,735
- You boys are so cute.

246
00:16:44,567 --> 00:16:47,150
(upbeat music)

247
00:16:55,037 --> 00:16:56,454
- Son of a bitch!

248
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:08,470
Shit!

249
00:17:08,470 --> 00:17:09,679
Shit!

250
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:10,512
Shit!

251
00:17:12,009 --> 00:17:12,842
- Oh Phil.

252
00:17:21,135 --> 00:17:22,802
- Turn off the pump!

253
00:17:24,473 --> 00:17:26,237
Damn it, it's not even on.

254
00:17:26,237 --> 00:17:29,203
- It's not?
- Turn the pump off!

255
00:17:29,203 --> 00:17:30,953
- That's what I said!

256
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:36,493
- Oh, it's losing pressure.
- Phil, where is the pipe?

257
00:17:36,493 --> 00:17:39,291
- I don't know.
- Where is it?

258
00:17:39,291 --> 00:17:40,874
- Is this it?
- Yes.

259
00:17:43,706 --> 00:17:46,373
(upbeat music)

260
00:17:48,886 --> 00:17:52,219
- I need a wrench.
- It's in the kitchen.

261
00:18:23,163 --> 00:18:25,913
- [Megan] Hold it on, hold it on!

262
00:18:34,255 --> 00:18:36,255
- All right, here it is.

263
00:18:42,433 --> 00:18:43,673
- [Carrie] I'm all wet.

264
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:48,743
- You have to turn the pump on first.

265
00:18:52,650 --> 00:18:55,483
- I know.
(Megan laughing)

266
00:19:07,901 --> 00:19:11,200
- Why don't you just leave
it, let the stepmother do it?

267
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,623
- Ex-stepmother.

268
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,153
How are you.

269
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:18,210
- It's a bit weird.

270
00:19:18,210 --> 00:19:19,603
- Because of Michael?

271
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:25,973
- It's got nothing to do with it.

272
00:19:27,493 --> 00:19:29,763
- You know, you're mad at him.

273
00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:32,370
- If he wants to blame me, that's fine,

274
00:19:32,370 --> 00:19:33,970
he should just come out and say.

275
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,903
- Nobody's blaming you Ray.

276
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:45,650
It was an accident, you've
got to get over this.

277
00:19:45,650 --> 00:19:46,483
- I've tried.

278
00:19:50,410 --> 00:19:52,740
I've replayed that night
so many times in my mind,

279
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:54,673
just tryin' to figure it out.

280
00:19:55,971 --> 00:19:57,133
It never makes sense.

281
00:19:58,162 --> 00:19:59,363
It was so dark.

282
00:20:01,610 --> 00:20:03,233
I guess I tripped,

283
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:07,473
or I got turned around.

284
00:20:10,058 --> 00:20:12,008
I never thought he'd be in front of me.

285
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:17,310
There's not a day that goes
by that I don't see his face.

286
00:20:18,735 --> 00:20:22,065
(somber music)

287
00:20:22,065 --> 00:20:26,482
(knocking)
- You know it's bullshit?

288
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:31,580
- What religion or God?
- Christianity.

289
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:34,990
- Oh, do enlighten us please.
- Think about it.

290
00:20:34,990 --> 00:20:37,120
You have all these guys, okay?

291
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:39,220
And they're following this one guy around,

292
00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:42,920
and he is telling them about
all this miraculous shit

293
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:44,500
that he's able to do, right?

294
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:48,350
Walk on water, and turn flesh into bread,

295
00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:49,513
blood into wine.

296
00:20:52,850 --> 00:20:54,310
They were stoned.
- Who?

297
00:20:55,550 --> 00:20:57,250
- The disciples.

298
00:20:57,250 --> 00:20:59,730
Come on, they were junkies,

299
00:20:59,730 --> 00:21:02,490
and Jesus Christ was a drug dealer.

300
00:21:02,490 --> 00:21:05,240
See, he got everyone so baked

301
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:07,680
that they really thought
they saw him, you know,

302
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:09,830
do all this miraculous shit,

303
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:14,140
and you know, that's the way it was,

304
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:16,220
but then what happens is,

305
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:18,710
is that the Romans, they come up

306
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:22,190
with this "Just say no" slogan, right?

307
00:21:22,190 --> 00:21:26,403
And they string him off,
Christ dies, and you know,

308
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:29,170
there's no more drugs.

309
00:21:29,170 --> 00:21:31,700
So the disciples, they
decide to have that one big,

310
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:34,880
you know, last blow out in
order to pay their respects.

311
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:38,830
They get together, they get so fucked up

312
00:21:39,930 --> 00:21:40,980
that one of the disciple guys,

313
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:43,130
he looks off into the
distance and he says,

314
00:21:44,467 --> 00:21:45,817
"He's risen from the dead."

315
00:21:47,990 --> 00:21:50,310
So, of course the rest of
them think they're rising

316
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:54,630
from the dead too, and

317
00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:58,370
then, withdrawal hits.,

318
00:21:58,370 --> 00:22:00,050
and they get so strung out
that they start writing

319
00:22:00,050 --> 00:22:03,190
all this nonsense about Noah's Ark,

320
00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:06,490
and Adam and Eve, and Moses.

321
00:22:06,490 --> 00:22:08,300
I mean come on guys,
have you read that shit,

322
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:09,200
it's pretty crazy.

323
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,987
- [Michael] So when did he drop out?

324
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,115
- Freshman year, second semester.

325
00:22:18,115 --> 00:22:19,900
- His grades?

326
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:23,320
- No, let's just say, I was not cut out

327
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:25,662
for the collegiate experience.

328
00:22:25,662 --> 00:22:27,420
- Man, that boy can cook.

329
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:30,150
- [Carrie] Yeah, told you,
he was good for something.

330
00:22:30,150 --> 00:22:31,200
- What did Gary want?

331
00:22:34,199 --> 00:22:35,773
- So that was who was on the phone.

332
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:41,563
What did Gary want?
- Who's Gary?

333
00:22:42,530 --> 00:22:44,780
- Just a guy.
- He's just some puts.

334
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:46,080
- You're in school, right?

335
00:22:47,450 --> 00:22:50,360
- Yeah, actually I was thinking
of taking next semester off,

336
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:54,470
and get away for a while.
- Get away from what?

337
00:22:54,470 --> 00:22:55,480
- How much do you have left then?

338
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:58,784
- In school, June, two
and a half years, depends.

339
00:22:58,784 --> 00:23:01,000
- [Megan] It sucks we're
not gonna graduate together.

340
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,310
- [Ray] Some of us won't graduate at all.

341
00:23:03,310 --> 00:23:04,410
- Fuck you, Ray, okay,

342
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:06,960
besides I don't need college,

343
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:08,600
they don't have a degree
in my field anyway.

344
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:11,070
- What, bullshit artist?
- Hey, I cause controversy,

345
00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:12,930
I get people stirred up,
they wanna do things.

346
00:23:12,930 --> 00:23:14,780
- Yeah, like kill you.

347
00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:16,760
- Stop being so fucking
apathetic about everything.

348
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:18,812
- Please, you're the
poster-child for apathy.

349
00:23:18,812 --> 00:23:22,630
- Oh, look who's talking.
(Phil laughing)

350
00:23:22,630 --> 00:23:24,210
- Look, why don't you just
save your bullshit analysis

351
00:23:24,210 --> 00:23:27,087
till you actually have the degree, okay?

352
00:23:34,928 --> 00:23:37,511
(somber music)

353
00:23:52,768 --> 00:23:55,601
(gunshot booming)

354
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:13,200
- Okay this is called Sniper,
and it goes like this,

355
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,170
we go around the table, one at a time,

356
00:24:15,170 --> 00:24:17,360
and each person has to choose a movie,

357
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:20,260
and then the rest of us have
to guess the scene in the movie

358
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:21,780
where a sniper could've
changed everything,

359
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:22,613
but you can't think about it,

360
00:24:22,613 --> 00:24:25,687
you gotta say it really quick,
or else you got to drink.

361
00:24:25,687 --> 00:24:26,530
- I don't get it.

362
00:24:26,530 --> 00:24:28,667
- It's easy, I'll give an example.

363
00:24:28,667 --> 00:24:32,700
"Rocky", you know the scene
where he's running up the steps?

364
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:34,850
And he jumps up and down in the air.

365
00:24:34,850 --> 00:24:35,790
Right there and then, bam,

366
00:24:35,790 --> 00:24:38,040
a sniper would have changed everything.

367
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:38,873
All right, go!

368
00:24:40,027 --> 00:24:41,129
- "The Sound of Music".

369
00:24:41,129 --> 00:24:42,759
- "The Hills Are Alive".

370
00:24:42,759 --> 00:24:46,232
♪ The hills are alive ♪

371
00:24:46,232 --> 00:24:48,820
- You guys can't sing, you
see, right then and there,

372
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:50,160
he would've taken out Julie Andrews,

373
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:51,420
she'd have rolled down the hill,

374
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:52,860
and that would've changed everything.

375
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:53,693
All right, fine.

376
00:24:54,535 --> 00:24:56,618
I'll take a drink.
- Okay.

377
00:24:58,694 --> 00:25:02,022
(all coughing)
- oh yuck.

378
00:25:02,022 --> 00:25:03,822
- All right, now it's your turn, go!

379
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:07,090
Ah, it's too late.

380
00:25:07,090 --> 00:25:09,633
Drink.
(all laughing)

381
00:25:12,106 --> 00:25:14,856
- Oh boys.
- All right, Megan, go!

382
00:25:16,602 --> 00:25:17,744
Holy Shit.

383
00:25:17,744 --> 00:25:19,773
- "A Streetcar Named Desire".

384
00:25:19,773 --> 00:25:21,933
- "A Streetcar"?
- Yeah!

385
00:25:21,933 --> 00:25:24,388
- What the hell, where
would in "Streetcar"

386
00:25:24,388 --> 00:25:26,200
would a sniper make a difference?

387
00:25:27,427 --> 00:25:28,563
"Streetcar", "Streetcar", Streetcar".

388
00:25:28,563 --> 00:25:32,810
- "Stella!"
(all laughing)

389
00:25:32,810 --> 00:25:34,353
- [Megan] Ray saves the day.

390
00:25:35,861 --> 00:25:36,861
- I'd drink to that.

391
00:25:38,737 --> 00:25:41,001
Oh god, Ray, you gotta pick a movie now.

392
00:25:41,001 --> 00:25:42,810
- A movie where a sniper
would make difference.

393
00:25:42,810 --> 00:25:44,578
- [Phil] Right.

394
00:25:44,578 --> 00:25:49,578
- "JFK".
(all laughing)

395
00:25:50,133 --> 00:25:53,571
- You are so mean. (laughs)

396
00:25:53,571 --> 00:25:56,154
(upbeat music)

397
00:26:12,801 --> 00:26:16,150
- No, can't use that
man, it burns my fingers.

398
00:26:16,150 --> 00:26:16,983
- Here.
- Okay.

399
00:26:17,970 --> 00:26:19,070
- This is much better.

400
00:26:49,146 --> 00:26:50,813
- What's the matter?

401
00:26:53,660 --> 00:26:55,093
- Nothing, I'm just tired.

402
00:26:56,263 --> 00:26:57,563
- Why don't you go to bed?

403
00:26:59,278 --> 00:27:00,973
- I'm not that kind of tired.

404
00:27:02,074 --> 00:27:03,610
- (coughs) it's probably better anyways,

405
00:27:03,610 --> 00:27:06,073
I mean look what happened last
time we all hang out, right?

406
00:27:15,784 --> 00:27:18,367
(somber music)

407
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:32,633
(gunshot booming)

408
00:27:40,577 --> 00:27:41,994
- [Michael] Alex!

409
00:28:16,542 --> 00:28:17,375
- Come on.

410
00:28:33,502 --> 00:28:34,419
- You okay?

411
00:28:37,038 --> 00:28:38,871
- I shouldn't be here.

412
00:28:41,490 --> 00:28:43,403
- What did you expect?

413
00:28:45,511 --> 00:28:47,801
- Wait a minute.
- What?

414
00:28:47,801 --> 00:28:50,013
What, what is it?
- What am I doing here?

415
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:55,023
- Phil's right, I mean it's sick.

416
00:28:58,052 --> 00:28:59,552
- I'm sorry you feel that way.

417
00:29:02,630 --> 00:29:04,680
- I mean this has got to be hard for you.

418
00:29:06,530 --> 00:29:08,443
- I just want you in my life again.

419
00:29:11,103 --> 00:29:11,936
- I am.

420
00:29:15,854 --> 00:29:16,854
- I hate it.

421
00:29:20,570 --> 00:29:21,693
- This won't work.

422
00:29:29,053 --> 00:29:30,683
- Give it a chance.

423
00:29:35,015 --> 00:29:35,848
- Okay.

424
00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:09,005
(upbeat music)

425
00:30:09,005 --> 00:30:11,005
- You watch a lot of TV?

426
00:30:12,810 --> 00:30:13,643
- Not really.

427
00:30:15,810 --> 00:30:16,923
- I love TV.

428
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:19,823
It relaxes me.

429
00:30:22,060 --> 00:30:23,310
You should watch more TV.

430
00:30:25,750 --> 00:30:28,243
- Oh yeah.
- Yeah.

431
00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:31,590
You're too stressed out, man.

432
00:30:32,763 --> 00:30:34,313
You have to relax a little bit.

433
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:37,833
- So I should watch TV.

434
00:30:39,030 --> 00:30:39,863
- Yeah,

435
00:30:41,990 --> 00:30:42,880
or get laid.

436
00:30:44,647 --> 00:30:46,447
When was the last time you got laid?

437
00:30:50,191 --> 00:30:51,403
(laughs) Yeah, well.

438
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:54,323
TV's safer anyway.

439
00:30:56,468 --> 00:30:58,468
They don't bullshit you like women will.

440
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:01,833
I watch a lot of TV.

441
00:31:04,610 --> 00:31:06,343
I like game shows the most.

442
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:08,480
It's real life you know.

443
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:12,193
I got this idea for my own game show.

444
00:31:13,270 --> 00:31:14,103
Check this out.

445
00:31:15,985 --> 00:31:17,963
You got like these three contestants,

446
00:31:19,326 --> 00:31:22,273
and they answer questions,
like on "Jeopardy", right,

447
00:31:23,830 --> 00:31:24,663
except

448
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:30,150
if they're buzzin' in,
and hittin' that clicker

449
00:31:30,150 --> 00:31:31,723
to answer questions,

450
00:31:32,610 --> 00:31:34,310
they're wearing like these helmets

451
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:40,057
with these big fucking bells on 'em,

452
00:31:41,850 --> 00:31:43,760
and they got these wooden mallets,

453
00:31:45,330 --> 00:31:47,480
and every time the
wanna answer a question,

454
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:50,520
they gotta hit themselves in the head

455
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:54,027
with this big fucking mallet.(laughs)

456
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:01,793
I didn't think that shit
would be so hysterical, man.

457
00:32:03,423 --> 00:32:04,620
(belches), three idiots

458
00:32:05,990 --> 00:32:08,540
hitting themselves on the
head to answer questions.

459
00:32:12,380 --> 00:32:13,380
It would be so cool.

460
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:20,553
Especially in Japan.
(both laughing)

461
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:23,447
Japanese love that shit.

462
00:32:29,395 --> 00:32:30,623
- You make this shit up,

463
00:32:30,623 --> 00:32:32,123
or do you just think about it?

464
00:32:33,150 --> 00:32:35,800
- No man, I think about
stuff like this all the time.

465
00:32:37,270 --> 00:32:39,215
I've got a lot of ideas.

466
00:32:39,215 --> 00:32:41,793
Couple of 'em are actually pretty good.

467
00:32:46,150 --> 00:32:46,983
Seriously.

468
00:32:47,818 --> 00:32:48,651
I mean

469
00:32:50,890 --> 00:32:53,040
I got a lot of ideas
about a lot of things.

470
00:32:57,060 --> 00:33:00,181
- Sure.
(Phil sighing)

471
00:33:00,181 --> 00:33:02,264
- Hey you know something.

472
00:33:03,973 --> 00:33:05,610
I really missed you man.

473
00:33:07,525 --> 00:33:08,375
Glad you're back.

474
00:33:11,152 --> 00:33:13,840
(Phil belching)

475
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:15,053
- I'm gonna go puke now.

476
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:18,340
- Have fun.

477
00:33:18,340 --> 00:33:19,173

me nervous, sit down.

493

all my dad would listen to.

496
00:35:26,340 --> 00:35:28,710
Hated it, every time I got into the car,

497
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:32,193
he had the radio tuned
to the same station.

498
00:35:33,430 --> 00:35:34,443
Country music.

499
00:35:38,510 --> 00:35:39,790
- So you're a little bit country,

500
00:35:39,790 --> 00:35:41,810
and a little bit rock 'n roll.

501
00:35:41,810 --> 00:35:43,003
- Not exactly.

502
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:45,220
I just went out with this guy,

503
00:35:45,220 --> 00:35:47,470
and his dad owned a kicker club,

504
00:35:47,470 --> 00:35:49,223
and I kinda liked it.

505
00:35:50,130 --> 00:35:52,111

506
00:35:52,111 --> 00:35:53,444

507
00:35:55,870 --> 00:35:58,313
- I don't know, no, why?

508
00:35:59,447 --> 00:36:01,410
- But you do see him a lot though?

509
00:36:01,410 --> 00:36:04,280
- Yeah, I guess, I guess I do.

510
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:06,580
I would see Megan more, but
every time try and call her,

511
00:36:06,580 --> 00:36:07,930
she's really busy you know.

512
00:36:08,962 --> 00:36:11,780

but we never get together

513
00:36:11,780 --> 00:36:12,640
in the end.

514
00:36:14,605 --> 00:36:17,450
I don't know, it's kind of
weird between us these days.

515
00:36:22,660 --> 00:36:23,727
- What about Ray?

516
00:36:26,370 --> 00:36:27,593
- Ray had a hard time.

517
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:34,313
I mean we all went through
it, but he had it the worst.

518
00:36:35,270 --> 00:36:39,693
I remember his face when
they took him in the cop car.

519
00:36:43,430 --> 00:36:45,880
I don't think he's ever
been the same since that.

00:53:32,300 --> 00:53:33,323
- She's not my type.

710
00:53:35,630 --> 00:53:37,689
- What are you afraid of?

711
00:53:37,689 --> 00:53:39,150
- I'm not afraid.
- Then ask her out,

712
00:53:39,150 --> 00:53:42,296
it's one date, what's the big deal?

713
00:53:42,296 --> 00:53:43,862
- Why is this so important to you?

714
00:53:43,862 --> 00:53:44,779
- It's not.

715
00:53:48,774 --> 00:53:50,691
- She'd make you happy.

716
00:53:54,340 --> 00:53:55,353
- I'm happy now.

717
00:53:57,067 --> 00:53:57,900
- So?

718
00:54:01,300 --> 00:54:02,133
What about now?

719
00:54:03,540 --> 00:54:05,590
Any meaningful relationships?

720
00:54:07,851 --> 00:54:10,851
(upbeat slow music)

721
00:54:13,008 --> 00:54:15,955
Are you afraid of rejection?

722
00:54:15,955 --> 00:54:17,390
I think I'm more afraid of commitment.

723
00:54:17,390 --> 00:54:20,937
- You've never shown your
depths to anybody, have you?

724
00:54:26,169 --> 00:54:27,710
- So I guess what really bothers me

725
00:54:27,710 --> 00:54:29,690
is that he just let her have it.

726
00:54:29,690 --> 00:54:32,410
I mean he fought her on
everything, the cars, the stocks,

727
00:54:32,410 --> 00:54:35,623
the house, but he just gave her the farm.

728
00:54:36,872 --> 00:54:40,499
And then he said by that
point, he just wanted end it.

729
00:54:40,499 --> 00:54:42,713
Give her what she
wanted, make her go away.

730
00:54:44,150 --> 00:54:46,010
- Why do Marcia want the farm?

731
00:54:46,010 --> 00:54:48,510
- She didn't, she just
didn't want him to have it.

732
00:54:50,490 --> 00:54:54,670
- And it wasn't his, I mean
your mother left it to you.

733
00:54:54,670 --> 00:54:57,210
- Yeah, but I was so young when she died

734
00:54:57,210 --> 00:55:00,830
that everything was left in
my dad's name, you know that.

735
00:55:00,830 --> 00:55:03,840
- And Marcia was entitled to half.

736
00:55:05,781 --> 00:55:07,181
- Why don't you talk to her?

737
00:55:08,210 --> 00:55:10,820
- All right, that wouldn't do any bad.

738
00:55:16,682 --> 00:55:17,515
So?

739
00:55:19,355 --> 00:55:20,605
Are you inclined to stay?

740
00:55:23,718 --> 00:55:26,718
(upbeat slow music)

741
00:55:29,070 --> 00:55:29,903
- Yeah.

742
00:55:33,594 --> 00:55:34,427
- Why?

743
00:55:49,271 --> 00:55:50,854
- A lot of reasons.

744
00:55:54,008 --> 00:55:55,675
- So what were they?

745
00:56:01,385 --> 00:56:02,218
You never

746
00:56:03,093 --> 00:56:04,093
fell in love

747
00:56:04,974 --> 00:56:05,807
ever?

748
00:56:44,123 --> 00:56:46,766
(gunshot booming)

749
00:56:46,766 --> 00:56:48,147
I'm sorry.

750
00:56:48,147 --> 00:56:48,980
No!

751
00:56:50,338 --> 00:56:51,171
I can't,

752
00:56:52,168 --> 00:56:53,408
it's just not right.

753
00:56:53,408 --> 00:56:54,241
- What?

754
00:56:56,120 --> 00:56:57,320
You were his girlfriend.

755
00:57:03,370 --> 00:57:04,763
- He's gone, Michael.

756
00:57:09,015 --> 00:57:09,848
- Sorry.

757
00:57:15,171 --> 00:57:16,671
- I don't get you.

758
00:57:21,461 --> 00:57:22,878
What do you want?

759
00:57:33,959 --> 00:57:34,792
Hey.

760
00:57:37,376 --> 00:57:38,959
You're gonna drown.

761
00:58:13,192 --> 00:58:15,708
(keys jingling)
(car engine revving)

762
00:58:15,708 --> 00:58:19,270
- Oh, where are you going?
- I'm leaving!

763
00:58:19,270 --> 00:58:21,940
- What's the matter?
- Get out of my way.

764
00:58:21,940 --> 00:58:25,463
- What is wrong?
- Oh no.

765
00:58:28,170 --> 00:58:30,344
I need to go!
- Fine!

766
00:58:30,344 --> 00:58:31,763
- Fine!
- Fine!

767
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:40,947
- You wanna get out now?
- No!

768
00:58:43,638 --> 00:58:46,870
- Fuck, I just fucking can't do this!

769
00:58:46,870 --> 00:58:49,083
- What, what?

770
00:58:51,239 --> 00:58:53,989
(Carrie sobbing)

771
00:58:55,890 --> 00:58:56,923
- God damn it.

772
00:59:03,463 --> 00:59:08,463
- What, what?
(Carrie screaming)

773
00:59:20,846 --> 00:59:22,013
- You're okay.

774
00:59:24,912 --> 00:59:26,912
- You don't know what I'm going through.

775
00:59:30,450 --> 00:59:31,663
- Yes, I do.

776
00:59:36,550 --> 00:59:39,193
- Oh god, guys are such assholes.

777
00:59:42,929 --> 00:59:44,767
I treat them like shit though.

778
00:59:46,230 --> 00:59:48,560
I do, I know I do, you know what,

779
00:59:48,560 --> 00:59:51,417
I'm just so fucking confused,
I don't know what to do.

780
00:59:51,417 --> 00:59:54,283
I just want.

781
00:59:54,283 --> 00:59:55,613
I just want out.

782
01:00:02,465 --> 01:00:05,715
This sucks.
- I know it sucks, it does.

783
01:00:13,533 --> 01:00:14,783
- Ugh, fucking jerk!

784
01:00:23,490 --> 01:00:25,933
Oh, the fuck am I gonna do.

785
01:00:27,535 --> 01:00:29,952
I don't know what I wanna do.

786
01:00:31,367 --> 01:00:36,367
(somber music)
(Carrie sobbing)

787
01:00:43,237 --> 01:00:45,737
(Ray sobbing)

788
01:00:57,498 --> 01:01:00,331
(gunshot booming)

789
01:01:04,855 --> 01:01:09,855
(Phil snorting)
(Phil coughing)

790
01:01:29,927 --> 01:01:32,013
- What are you doing fella?

791
01:01:36,220 --> 01:01:37,970
- I wanted to come out here so bad.

792
01:01:42,928 --> 01:01:46,950
I didn't think it was
gonna end up like this.

793
01:01:46,950 --> 01:01:47,873
- I did neither.

794
01:01:54,200 --> 01:01:57,373
- I didn't mean what I said,

795
01:02:00,457 --> 01:02:01,403
or what I did.

796
01:02:07,150 --> 01:02:08,373
- Yeah, you did.

797
01:02:11,240 --> 01:02:12,440
People don't say things,

798
01:02:12,440 --> 01:02:14,490
unless they partially believe 'em, right?

799
01:02:19,950 --> 01:02:21,350
- Why did you sleep with me?

800
01:02:24,790 --> 01:02:27,223
- Oh god, that was a long time ago.

801
01:02:29,360 --> 01:02:30,810
I was drunk, I was upset,

802
01:02:30,810 --> 01:02:32,360
I didn't know what I was doing.

803
01:02:34,100 --> 01:02:36,053
It was a mistake, I'm sorry.

804
01:02:39,670 --> 01:02:42,220
- I guess I just thought
it really meant something.

805
01:02:43,840 --> 01:02:45,663
- Sex means nothing to me.

806
01:02:47,740 --> 01:02:50,120
Most guys will do anything for sex,

807
01:02:50,120 --> 01:02:52,653
and once they've got it, they're gone.

808
01:02:55,660 --> 01:02:57,810
I don't want you to be
like the other guys.

809
01:03:02,150 --> 01:03:03,883
I don't want you to leave me.

810
01:03:06,238 --> 01:03:07,088
- Why would I go?

811
01:03:11,100 --> 01:03:12,750
You see through my best bullshit.

812
01:03:14,850 --> 01:03:16,100
That keeps me on my toes.

813
01:03:20,980 --> 01:03:24,450
Do you remember the day we skipped school,

814
01:03:24,450 --> 01:03:27,433
and I helped you look at cars?

815
01:03:28,325 --> 01:03:30,520
- Mm-hmm (affirmative).

816
01:03:30,520 --> 01:03:33,660
- I mean we must have spent
the whole day test driving

817
01:03:33,660 --> 01:03:35,560
every car known to mankind, and

818
01:03:39,120 --> 01:03:41,700
later that day when I dropped you off,

819
01:03:41,700 --> 01:03:44,130
you looked at me and
you said, "I love you".

820
01:03:48,850 --> 01:03:51,350
I know it was just in a
friendly kind of way, but,

821
01:03:52,803 --> 01:03:54,663
and you went inside, I actually did a,

822
01:03:56,460 --> 01:03:58,010
a back flip in your front yard.

823
01:04:01,920 --> 01:04:04,583
Of course the next morning
when I called, you were gone,

824
01:04:06,600 --> 01:04:10,170
and then that Monday you pulled
up in your brand new Jeep.

825
01:04:10,170 --> 01:04:11,920
Ray and Michael along for the ride.

826
01:04:16,729 --> 01:04:18,812
We never looked at Jeeps.

827
01:04:21,490 --> 01:04:23,390
I guess I'm just trying to explain why

828
01:04:24,600 --> 01:04:26,223
sometimes I'm such an asshole.

829
01:04:30,330 --> 01:04:33,030
Now after Alex died, nothing
made sense to me anymore,

830
01:04:35,070 --> 01:04:36,223
except being with you.

831
01:04:39,030 --> 01:04:41,483
You know somehow that makes sense to me.

832
01:04:44,680 --> 01:04:45,513
- Oh god.

833
01:04:48,670 --> 01:04:50,493
I wish I could say the same.

834
01:04:51,900 --> 01:04:54,650
It's not that I don't care
about you, 'cause I do it's,

835
01:04:56,369 --> 01:04:58,313
it's, oh god. (sighs)

836
01:05:02,442 --> 01:05:05,692
Phil, you don't need this.
- I love you.

837
01:05:11,040 --> 01:05:12,003
It's okay.

838
01:05:16,030 --> 01:05:16,863
I'll wait.

839
01:05:21,213 --> 01:05:23,963
(Carrie sighing)

840
01:05:36,778 --> 01:05:40,778
Does this means I could
sleep on your couch now?

841
01:05:42,352 --> 01:05:45,019
(both laughing)

842
01:05:47,330 --> 01:05:48,163
- Not a chance.

843
01:05:50,108 --> 01:05:52,691
(upbeat music)

844
01:06:08,996 --> 01:06:13,163
(somber music)
- Oh guys, come on!

845
01:06:16,385 --> 01:06:18,500
(television murmuring)

846
01:06:18,500 --> 01:06:20,938
- Come on, come on, come
on, come on, come on,

847
01:06:20,938 --> 01:06:22,390
let's see something here.

848
01:06:22,390 --> 01:06:24,850
- [Michael] Nothing's
gonna happen this time.

849
01:06:24,850 --> 01:06:26,320
- [Phil] All right.

850
01:06:26,320 --> 01:06:27,512
Don't catch that.
- No don't.

851
01:06:27,512 --> 01:06:29,422
- Don't catch that.

852
01:06:29,422 --> 01:06:30,765
Son of a bitch!

853
01:06:30,765 --> 01:06:32,673
- Oh god damn it.

854
01:06:32,673 --> 01:06:35,458
They're gonna lose.
- I don't wanna watch this.

855
01:06:35,458 --> 01:06:37,010
- Hey.
- Hey, come on.

856
01:06:37,010 --> 01:06:38,037
- What?
- Turn it back on.

857
01:06:38,037 --> 01:06:40,620
- What's the matter.
- I thought you didn't care.

858
01:06:40,620 --> 01:06:42,593
- Turn it on.
- All right.

859
01:06:44,256 --> 01:06:47,350
(television murmuring)
- oh yeah, I can't see.

860
01:06:47,350 --> 01:06:49,156
- It doesn't matter, there's
nothing to watch anyway.

861
01:06:49,156 --> 01:06:54,156
- Sit down!
(Phil sighs)

862
01:06:54,427 --> 01:06:56,760
- Oh, let's go you, merries.

863
01:06:59,053 --> 01:07:01,553
- Nice outfit on.
- What, what?

864
01:07:03,598 --> 01:07:05,944
- Nothing.
- Come on, let's go!

865
01:07:05,944 --> 01:07:09,482
(all cheering)
- we're coming, hang on.

866
01:07:09,482 --> 01:07:11,560
- Go ahead, I'll meet you out there.

867
01:07:11,560 --> 01:07:15,060
- No, I'll wait.
- No, it's okay, go ahead.

868
01:07:17,975 --> 01:07:19,975
- All right, I love you.

869
01:07:29,966 --> 01:07:32,675
(television murmuring)
- come on let's go.

870
01:07:32,675 --> 01:07:34,693
Oh baby, oh baby.
- They're not gonna do it.

871
01:07:34,693 --> 01:07:36,826
- Oh no, no, come on, come on.
- They're not gonna do it.

872
01:07:36,826 --> 01:07:37,929
- Come on, come on.
- Oh yeah.

873
01:07:37,929 --> 01:07:42,849
- Yeah, go, go, go, go, go.
- Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

874
01:07:42,849 --> 01:07:45,496
- Come on.
- Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

875
01:07:45,496 --> 01:07:46,777
Yes!
- Yeah!

876
01:07:46,777 --> 01:07:49,340
- Yes, yes!
- Oh my god.

877
01:07:49,340 --> 01:07:50,930
- Told ya, you didn't have any faith, man.

878
01:07:50,930 --> 01:07:52,702
- Oh yeah, right.

879
01:07:52,702 --> 01:07:56,226
- Yeah, this is gonna be the year.

880
01:07:56,226 --> 01:07:57,850
- Look at that replay.
- Look at the replay.

881
01:07:57,850 --> 01:08:00,517
(both laughing)

882
01:08:20,148 --> 01:08:22,481
- Come on, let's go hunting.

883
01:08:23,847 --> 01:08:26,849
- Jacklighting's not hunting,

884
01:08:26,849 --> 01:08:27,932
it's killing.

885
01:08:44,923 --> 01:08:45,756
- Hi.

886
01:08:50,761 --> 01:08:52,178
- Is that for me?

887
01:08:53,125 --> 01:08:53,958
- Here.

888
01:09:02,230 --> 01:09:04,530
- This weekend's not
what I expected it to be.

889
01:09:11,550 --> 01:09:12,853
- I'm sorry.

890
01:09:15,240 --> 01:09:16,073
I just.

891
01:09:17,740 --> 01:09:19,826
- How did we get here?

892
01:09:19,826 --> 01:09:24,826
We're so fucked up.(laughs)

893
01:09:29,900 --> 01:09:34,500
People are graduating college,
they're getting married,

894
01:09:34,500 --> 01:09:36,793
they have careers, they have kids,

895
01:09:38,202 --> 01:09:39,035
and

896
01:09:40,237 --> 01:09:43,593
I feel like we're in this hole,

897
01:09:44,790 --> 01:09:46,890
waiting for something to come lift us out.

898
01:09:49,608 --> 01:09:51,023
I'm barely treading water.

899
01:09:53,541 --> 01:09:56,143
I'm not doing anything.

900
01:10:01,590 --> 01:10:03,190
- I just didn't know what to do.

901
01:10:04,246 --> 01:10:05,973
- Oh, you're not getting me.

902
01:10:13,400 --> 01:10:15,045
My dad wanted to be the one to tell me

903
01:10:15,045 --> 01:10:17,890
that he and Marcia were
gonna get divorced,

904
01:10:17,890 --> 01:10:21,730
but he couldn't speak because
he was crying so hard,

905
01:10:22,970 --> 01:10:24,647
and I've never seen my dad cry,

906
01:10:24,647 --> 01:10:26,953
I mean I thought he was
a strongest man alive.

907
01:10:30,370 --> 01:10:31,343
He cracked.

908
01:10:35,790 --> 01:10:37,453
And to see your parent like that,

909
01:10:39,910 --> 01:10:43,020
it just makes you realize
that it doesn't matter how old

910
01:10:43,020 --> 01:10:46,000
you are, you're still
gonna fuck things up,

911
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:49,430
it's just that you have to
learn how to deal with them,

912
01:10:49,430 --> 01:10:50,263
or you die.

913
01:10:58,060 --> 01:10:59,810
Why did you run away?

914
01:11:13,739 --> 01:11:15,393
- I wasn't running.

915
01:11:18,100 --> 01:11:19,443
It's complicated.

916
01:11:20,300 --> 01:11:21,633
- Talk to me Michael.

917
01:11:22,647 --> 01:11:24,897
Yes, you can.
- No, I can't.

918
01:11:27,340 --> 01:11:29,450
Don't you get it, damn it, I
would talk to you if I could,

919
01:11:29,450 --> 01:11:34,213
but I, I can't why can't
you understand that.

920
01:11:34,213 --> 01:11:35,963
- Look at yourself.

921
01:11:37,730 --> 01:11:41,240
Are you planning on running
away for the rest of your life,

922
01:11:41,240 --> 01:11:43,360
because I don't think there's
anywhere in the world,

923
01:11:43,360 --> 01:11:45,469
that's gonna be far enough.

924
01:11:45,469 --> 01:11:47,000
- Oh, what, run you son of a bitch.

925
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:49,029
- Go, go, yes!
- Yeah!

926
01:11:49,029 --> 01:11:50,029
- Fuck yeah.

927
01:11:51,326 --> 01:11:53,033
- Do you wanna know.

928
01:11:53,033 --> 01:11:54,630
Do you wanna know why I came back here,

929
01:11:54,630 --> 01:11:56,263
why I dragged myself back here,

930
01:11:57,600 --> 01:11:58,993
because I'm so tired.

931
01:11:59,919 --> 01:12:01,373
I'm tired of being afraid.

932
01:12:02,817 --> 01:12:05,400
(somber music)

933
01:12:08,545 --> 01:12:13,323
I'm so tired of being the
only one that knows the truth.

934
01:12:16,491 --> 01:12:21,491
- The truth about what?

935
01:12:23,609 --> 01:12:25,526
- The truth about Alex.

936
01:12:34,319 --> 01:12:37,402
(tense somber music)

937
01:12:53,315 --> 01:12:56,565
(television murmuring)

938
01:13:10,027 --> 01:13:12,610
(Phil sighing)

939
01:13:23,616 --> 01:13:25,080
- What are you doing?

940
01:13:25,080 --> 01:13:28,583
- I have to tell you
something about that night.

941
01:13:35,205 --> 01:13:37,240
- Excuse me, but not everyone is born

942
01:13:37,240 --> 01:13:39,073
knowing exactly what they wanna be.

943
01:13:44,353 --> 01:13:46,240
- I never had a choice.
- Oh please,

944
01:13:46,240 --> 01:13:49,060
you've never had to work hard
for anything in your life.

945
01:13:49,060 --> 01:13:50,850
I mean come on.

946
01:13:50,850 --> 01:13:52,180
You think you know what
it's like not to know

947
01:13:52,180 --> 01:13:55,373
what the next step is,
it's so easy for you.

948
01:13:56,290 --> 01:13:57,870
You will always get what you want,

949
01:13:57,870 --> 01:13:59,900
it's always been that way.

950
01:13:59,900 --> 01:14:00,850
- So, they tell me.

951
01:14:02,740 --> 01:14:06,360
- My prescription for you
is, take six of these,

952
01:14:06,360 --> 01:14:07,710
and call me in the morning.

953
01:14:12,170 --> 01:14:14,853
- Yes Sir.
- Let's go you, merries.

954
01:14:17,793 --> 01:14:21,945
- Oh, nice outfit.
(Carrie laughing)

955
01:14:21,945 --> 01:14:22,778
- What?

956
01:14:33,293 --> 01:14:38,293
(birds squawking)
(somber music)

957
01:14:41,401 --> 01:14:44,318
(gunshots booming)

958
01:14:46,601 --> 01:14:47,934
- [Ray] Get him!

959
01:14:49,330 --> 01:14:51,146
- Oh yeah.
- I got him.

960
01:14:51,146 --> 01:14:51,979
- Get him!

961
01:15:06,418 --> 01:15:09,335
(Michael laughing)

962
01:15:19,159 --> 01:15:21,742
- [Ray] Die you son of a bitch.

963
01:15:24,285 --> 01:15:27,202
(gunshots booming)

964
01:15:33,175 --> 01:15:34,342
- No, Ray, no!

965
01:15:40,944 --> 01:15:41,777
No!

966
01:15:47,284 --> 01:15:48,534
- [Ray] Oh god.

967
01:15:56,920 --> 01:15:58,253
- [Carrie] Alex?

968
01:15:59,379 --> 01:16:00,212
Alex!

969
01:16:15,670 --> 01:16:18,453
- You knew, and you didn't tell me.

970
01:16:19,950 --> 01:16:21,989
- That's why I left.
- That's why you left?

971
01:16:21,989 --> 01:16:23,040
How could you do that?

972
01:16:23,040 --> 01:16:25,280
How could you, how could
you, how could you go,

973
01:16:25,280 --> 01:16:26,263
and tell me one?

974
01:16:28,844 --> 01:16:29,927
- I couldn't.

975
01:16:30,800 --> 01:16:32,660
- You could, and why not?

976
01:16:32,660 --> 01:16:33,570
You son of a bitch.
- Come on, Ray,

977
01:16:33,570 --> 01:16:35,596
don't do this, man.

978
01:16:35,596 --> 01:16:37,276
- You son of a bitch, why not?

979
01:16:37,276 --> 01:16:38,659
You motherfucker.

980
01:16:38,659 --> 01:16:40,862
You son of a bitch.

981
01:16:40,862 --> 01:16:41,695
Tell me.

982
01:16:43,886 --> 01:16:46,579
Why didn't you tell me?

983
01:16:46,579 --> 01:16:49,187
Why don't you wanna?

984
01:16:49,187 --> 01:16:51,993
Tell me why, tell me.
(both sobbing)

985
01:16:51,993 --> 01:16:53,593
- Because it was my fault.

986
01:16:57,030 --> 01:16:58,693
He came to me for help,

987
01:17:00,901 --> 01:17:02,401
and I did nothing.

988
01:17:06,200 --> 01:17:07,823
I didn't know.

989
01:17:11,146 --> 01:17:12,573
I couldn't stop it.

990
01:17:17,271 --> 01:17:18,104
I'm sorry.

991
01:17:21,429 --> 01:17:22,262
I'm sorry.

992
01:17:32,080 --> 01:17:34,747
(door slamming)

993
01:17:52,897 --> 01:17:55,662
- Jacklighting's not hunting,

994
01:17:55,662 --> 01:17:56,745
it's killing.

995
01:17:59,862 --> 01:18:02,779
(gunshots booming)

996
01:18:12,929 --> 01:18:14,512
- [Carrie] Michael!

997
01:18:17,827 --> 01:18:20,410
(somber music)

998
01:18:35,564 --> 01:18:37,564
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

999
01:18:39,172 --> 01:18:41,339
- [Michael] Oh, I'm sorry.

1000
01:18:45,854 --> 01:18:49,187
What are you doing?
- It's gonna be okay.

1001
01:19:18,516 --> 01:19:21,099
(upbeat music)

1002
01:20:20,065 --> 01:20:22,815
(spoons chiming)

1003
01:21:00,823 --> 01:21:03,573
(birds chirping)

1004
01:21:07,446 --> 01:21:08,446
- I'm sorry.

1005
01:21:10,910 --> 01:21:13,260
- It doesn't matter now,
what's passed is past.

1006
01:21:17,070 --> 01:21:18,463
Tired of being angry.

1007
01:21:20,341 --> 01:21:23,910
I was always competing with
you for his friendship.

1008
01:21:23,910 --> 01:21:25,303
The truth is back then,

1009
01:21:28,320 --> 01:21:30,620
I never really knew him
as well as I knew you.

1010
01:21:32,189 --> 01:21:37,189
(upbeat music)
(birds chirping)

1011
01:22:30,103 --> 01:22:32,508
- Hey, hey there, Mikey.

1012
01:22:32,508 --> 01:22:34,509
Don't go getting your
nipples pierced, okay.

1013
01:22:34,509 --> 01:22:35,922
- Yeah, we'll see.

1014
01:22:35,922 --> 01:22:37,775
- Take care of yourself, Michael.

1015
01:22:37,775 --> 01:22:38,608
- I will.

1016
01:22:40,100 --> 01:22:42,300
- You two, try not to
kill each other, okay.

1017
01:22:45,960 --> 01:22:48,467
I forgot to give you this time last time.

1018
01:22:52,664 --> 01:22:54,331
You look good today.

1019
01:23:01,850 --> 01:23:03,133
So long, Ray.
- Okay.

1020
01:23:05,060 --> 01:23:05,893
See you around?

1021
01:23:08,986 --> 01:23:11,179
- You take care of yourself, man.

1022
01:23:11,179 --> 01:23:12,012
- Yeah.

1023
01:23:13,108 --> 01:23:13,941
You too.

1024
01:23:34,570 --> 01:23:37,313
- [Alex] Today, the day of our graduation.

1025
01:23:39,540 --> 01:23:41,633
It's not only an high
school which we leave today.

1026
01:23:42,527 --> 01:23:44,333
It's adolescence.

1027
01:23:44,333 --> 01:23:48,707
From this day on, nothing
is required of us by others,

1028
01:23:48,707 --> 01:23:50,210
it's only ourselves that can set the rules

1029
01:23:50,210 --> 01:23:51,410
by which we must follow.

1030
01:23:52,650 --> 01:23:55,313
The road ahead for each
of us is a different one.

1031
01:23:56,550 --> 01:23:58,680
We must each take what
we've learned and use it

1032
01:23:58,680 --> 01:24:00,670
to guide us through, trusting ourselves

1033
01:24:00,670 --> 01:24:02,723
to navigate correctly and efficiently.

1034
01:24:04,570 --> 01:24:07,670
The barriers that lie before us

1035
01:24:07,670 --> 01:24:08,833
are there to be broken.

1036
01:24:11,310 --> 01:24:13,560
The power is in each of us to conquer

1037
01:24:13,560 --> 01:24:15,560
whatever obstacles may stand in our way.

1038
01:24:17,830 --> 01:24:19,363
Choose your battles wisely,

1039
01:24:20,610 --> 01:24:21,610
and fight them well.

1040
01:24:22,820 --> 01:24:24,820
For at the end of the road lies success,

1041
01:24:26,041 --> 01:24:28,603
and with success at any level,

1042
01:24:30,350 --> 01:24:32,723
happiness is sure to follow.

1043
01:24:34,650 --> 01:24:37,500
I can only say that I hope
to see each one of you

1044
01:24:37,500 --> 01:24:38,400
on the other side.

1045
01:24:40,080 --> 01:24:42,763
Congratulations, and good luck.

1046
