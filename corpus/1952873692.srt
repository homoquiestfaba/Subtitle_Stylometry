1
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:41,885
<i> course I have heard of him </ i>

2
00:01:41,922 --> 00:01:43,558
<i> like all hunters. </ i>

3
00:01:44,894 --> 00:01:48,068
<i> It was the time that people
still feared dragons. </ i>

4
00:01:54,291 --> 00:01:58,689
<i> As a boy he learned to hunt,
traps and snares be placed </ i>

5
00:01:59,964 --> 00:02:02,103
<i> for himself and his sister alive. </ i>

6
00:02:11,795 --> 00:02:13,660
<i> But then one day ...</ i>

7
00:02:15,507 --> 00:02:18,104
<i> the beast came near Kinatra. </ i>

8
00:02:23,562 --> 00:02:27,195
<i> An animal larger than any dragon
I've ever seen. </ i>

9
00:02:28,285 --> 00:02:31,689
<i> Altered in one go
future of the young Ahab. </ i>

10
00:04:20,556 --> 00:04:24,572
<i> When you see such a huge beast,
would frighten even the bravest man. </ i>

11
00:04:25,908 --> 00:04:29,160
<i> He challenged the beast with all his might </ i>

12
00:04:29,678 --> 00:04:32,307
<i> and took him to ...
again and again. </ i>

13
00:04:52,019 --> 00:04:54,037
<i> How he escaped alive nobody knows. </ i>

14
00:04:54,799 --> 00:04:56,817
<i> His face and body burned. </ i>

15
00:04:57,254 --> 00:04:59,731
<i> Some say the dragon
deliberately left him alive. </ i>

16
00:04:59,749 --> 00:05:01,811
<i> Others say he has gone mad </ i>

17
00:05:02,579 --> 00:05:04,946
<i> and his soul has lost that day. </ i>

18
00:05:19,768 --> 00:05:23,171
<i> It was the story that made me Ahab
incentive for this trip ...</ i>

19
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:27,335
<i> we beaches on Kovinstown
this rainy evening. </ i>

20
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:30,099
Fisherman?

21
00:05:30,121 --> 00:05:31,529
So you may call me.

22
00:05:31,559 --> 00:05:33,654
And the native name of your friend?

23
00:05:33,673 --> 00:05:36,498
Queequeg, his father was a great warrior.

24
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:40,540
His name and his soul strains
from great fighters.

25
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:43,682
It is his face that tells a story.

26
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:46,836
If he can handle a thousand devils.

27
00:05:46,851 --> 00:05:49,556
That he might, he has never
gone sideways for a fight.

28
00:05:49,602 --> 00:05:53,388
He always has some on hand?

29
00:05:56,487 --> 00:05:59,771
Another round.
- You're a good man?

30
00:06:00,098 --> 00:06:01,886
Well tell me about yourself.

31
00:06:03,126 --> 00:06:08,560
A wanderer an orphan,
the blood began to boil inside me ...

32
00:06:08,602 --> 00:06:11,810
so I figured it's time
to move on.

33
00:06:11,856 --> 00:06:13,644
Ah, an adventurer.

34
00:06:13,921 --> 00:06:16,365
I guess I'm curious
all things in the world.

35
00:06:16,396 --> 00:06:19,069
A poet!

36
00:06:19,331 --> 00:06:21,655
Why are you here looking for Ahab?

37
00:06:23,014 --> 00:06:25,185
I've heard that here
can register ...

38
00:06:25,214 --> 00:06:26,195
to hunt dragons.

39
00:06:26,231 --> 00:06:28,096
Together with the hunters to work

40
00:06:28,143 --> 00:06:31,471
and for us to join Ahab.

41
00:06:36,074 --> 00:06:37,984
It's true ...

42
00:06:38,604 --> 00:06:41,277
the world is run by Dragon Oil.

43
00:06:41,539 --> 00:06:44,408
And the city is the marketplace
for all traders.

44
00:06:48,374 --> 00:06:51,352
Why the cursed man?

45
00:06:51,366 --> 00:06:53,657
He is the best known of the dragon hunters.

46
00:06:53,948 --> 00:06:56,654
That's it ...
that he is, my friend.

47
00:06:57,390 --> 00:06:59,715
Want to tell me,
that you're a harpooner?

48
00:07:00,337 --> 00:07:01,973
Yes, that's me.

49
00:07:03,378 --> 00:07:05,243
Ballast for me!

50
00:07:05,291 --> 00:07:07,768
Is there any ballast, Mr. Starbuck?

51
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:10,914
We are all ballast, Mr. Stubb.

52
00:07:15,311 --> 00:07:17,056
But to hunt together with Ahab ...

53
00:07:17,341 --> 00:07:20,166
you must answer to God.

54
00:07:20,187 --> 00:07:22,663
Then you have the best harpooner
world.

55
00:07:24,585 --> 00:07:26,800
Are you sure
you're a harpooner?

56
00:07:28,903 --> 00:07:31,150
He's just a fresh beginner.

57
00:07:31,882 --> 00:07:35,473
And you're a fat pig skinned
should be for Easter.

58
00:07:36,011 --> 00:07:37,418
Calm down, Mr.. Floss.

59
00:07:40,952 --> 00:07:42,937
Let's see if he
truth.

60
00:07:43,423 --> 00:07:44,405
A match.

61
00:07:47,132 --> 00:07:49,379
This is good enough.

62
00:07:52,167 --> 00:07:53,455
What do you, Mr.. Starbuck?

63
00:07:53,892 --> 00:07:57,404
Would you harpoon it, the dragon
could throw?

64
00:07:58,632 --> 00:08:00,956
You're always worth the
Mr. betting. Stubb.

65
00:08:02,778 --> 00:08:05,178
Let's see how good your poor, boy.

66
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:16,554
Let us pass.
On the side I told you!

67
00:08:17,855 --> 00:08:20,680
The large white dragon Ahab's legend.

68
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:24,061
Means you meet him dead.

69
00:08:24,084 --> 00:08:27,488
Except, of course, old Ahab.

70
00:08:30,021 --> 00:08:32,771
Mr. Starbuck, give the boy a harpoon.

71
00:08:33,297 --> 00:08:35,206
I already have one.

72
00:08:42,665 --> 00:08:44,607
A little small?

73
00:08:45,029 --> 00:08:46,238
Okay, Mr. Floss.

74
00:08:48,663 --> 00:08:50,147
Go my way.

75
00:09:00,644 --> 00:09:02,237
Can you beat that?

76
00:09:15,651 --> 00:09:17,090
Good shot.

77
00:09:18,393 --> 00:09:21,601
Well that's something you
not see every day, Mr.. Stubb.

78
00:09:22,443 --> 00:09:24,188
True enough, Mr.. Starbuck.

79
00:09:33,309 --> 00:09:35,480
Well done.

80
00:09:35,821 --> 00:09:39,879
Tell me how this thing works.

81
00:09:40,983 --> 00:09:44,191
It makes the harpoon faster, and ...
- It was just luck.

82
00:09:44,549 --> 00:09:48,456
How are you with a knife?
- Enough!

83
00:09:51,232 --> 00:09:53,218
Whoever it may or not be?

84
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:58,533
The child of the devil himself.
- Go away drunk.

85
00:10:00,983 --> 00:10:03,426
This is Ahab's daughter, Rachel.

86
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:07,693
Would you use it against me?
- No.

87
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:10,590
But if you want to register
the team ...

88
00:10:13,045 --> 00:10:14,528
sign here!

89
00:10:14,573 --> 00:10:17,094
Rachel, I told you ...
- Quiet, you're just an instructor ...

90
00:10:17,111 --> 00:10:19,358
remember that!

91
00:10:22,065 --> 00:10:24,771
You will compete as
the rest of the group ...

92
00:10:24,817 --> 00:10:27,108
in an equal share of the profits.

93
00:10:27,141 --> 00:10:28,656
There are plenty of hunters ...

94
00:10:29,469 --> 00:10:32,065
but not many dare to take
against dragons.

95
00:10:33,852 --> 00:10:36,099
The work is overrated.

96
00:10:45,016 --> 00:10:48,344
A toast to one hundred dragons for Piquat.

97
00:10:48,636 --> 00:10:51,419
Piquat ...
- Piquat, Piquat ...

98
00:10:51,449 --> 00:10:55,113
Rachel?
He goes with me!

99
00:11:07,348 --> 00:11:09,137
Are you sure
it's safe here?

100
00:11:09,188 --> 00:11:11,632
Believe me
I do not need your protection.

101
00:11:13,915 --> 00:11:15,703
We were just leaving anyway.

102
00:11:22,994 --> 00:11:25,165
If that is Ahab's daughter.

103
00:11:25,732 --> 00:11:28,024
Or should I say, Ahab's whore?

104
00:11:28,849 --> 00:11:32,677
You see what scum
nowadays you will find on the street.

105
00:11:32,719 --> 00:11:35,349
We were never good enough
for you to hunt?

106
00:11:35,908 --> 00:11:37,043
Go back!

107
00:11:37,287 --> 00:11:41,805
Tastico, you were not even good enough
the shit out of the vehicle.

108
00:11:46,333 --> 00:11:47,468
Stay out!

109
00:12:14,988 --> 00:12:17,127
Be at sunrise at the departure point,

110
00:12:17,162 --> 00:12:18,907
and party too much.

111
00:12:45,221 --> 00:12:47,850
Hey look it's that old man from the city.

112
00:12:51,579 --> 00:12:56,173
You're the one who needs salvation.

113
00:13:00,485 --> 00:13:04,806
I've seen the book signing.

114
00:13:05,556 --> 00:13:10,183
Have not you heard what I said,
the writing of your souls?

115
00:13:11,134 --> 00:13:14,188
Maybe you have no soul.

116
00:13:15,427 --> 00:13:16,714
Let's go ...

117
00:13:18,362 --> 00:13:19,802
his thoughts are broken.

118
00:13:21,114 --> 00:13:24,213
You have not seen that old devil?

119
00:13:26,201 --> 00:13:27,379
Old devil?

120
00:13:28,592 --> 00:13:31,844
Have I not told
how he was dragged to hell ...

121
00:13:31,862 --> 00:13:35,878
and dragged everyone
on his path of revenge?

122
00:13:35,925 --> 00:13:40,943
His face, his soul,
and torn skin forever.

123
00:13:43,048 --> 00:13:46,256
What's your name?
- Elijah.

124
00:13:48,136 --> 00:13:52,500
And believe me, boy,
but one man will survive,

125
00:13:52,519 --> 00:13:57,419
to Ahab's story to tell.
But a man!

126
00:14:34,317 --> 00:14:36,106
Ah, the adventurers.

127
00:14:37,402 --> 00:14:38,841
So you show up?

128
00:14:39,452 --> 00:14:41,852
Just in time for stocks
bring onboard.

129
00:14:43,189 --> 00:14:45,207
Starbuck! I want to rest.

130
00:14:52,318 --> 00:14:54,489
What is the story of your friend there?

131
00:14:55,966 --> 00:14:59,065
Especially ...
I have known him a long time.

132
00:15:00,385 --> 00:15:02,207
How long you been hunting with this team?

133
00:15:02,804 --> 00:15:04,473
About eight years.

134
00:15:05,078 --> 00:15:08,515
We already have a lot of money.
But again issued.

135
00:15:10,033 --> 00:15:11,702
I have been married three times.

136
00:15:12,533 --> 00:15:15,632
She left ...
I left them all laughing.

137
00:15:17,227 --> 00:15:19,092
They asked me to come back ...

138
00:15:22,493 --> 00:15:24,970
but of course I did not.

139
00:15:28,058 --> 00:15:31,310
Have you ever fought with the white dragon ...

140
00:15:31,566 --> 00:15:34,041
where Ahab is all his life back?

141
00:15:34,973 --> 00:15:36,958
This beast is really bad!

142
00:15:36,994 --> 00:15:42,013
They say he brings death
to the people. Really bad.

143
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:45,939
The whole team has Ahab's murder
the last time ...

144
00:15:45,984 --> 00:15:47,271
that she came face.

145
00:15:47,313 --> 00:15:49,255
When I signed.

146
00:15:50,757 --> 00:15:53,507
But no boy
I'm never seen.

147
00:15:53,747 --> 00:15:57,108
And I pray God that I never do.

148
00:16:01,316 --> 00:16:04,796
It is better for you that old
metal monster now bless ...

149
00:16:05,583 --> 00:16:07,525
because it will be your home for a while.

150
00:16:09,204 --> 00:16:14,069
Come on let's not hang around
the rest on board.

151
00:16:16,429 --> 00:16:20,641
<i> The vehicle is a strange long Piquat

00:18:06,214 --> 00:18:10,044
<i> Resistant to fire, and more
rope than any else. </ i>

177
00:18:10,329 --> 00:18:13,460
<i> With this, we are ready to attack. </ i>

178
00:18:19,443 --> 00:18:21,505
<i> Flask was one big vicious inspiring man </ i>

179
00:18:21,543 --> 00:18:23,453
<i> with a hardened soul. </ i>

180
00:18:23,497 --> 00:18:25,592
<i> He was the more abstract </ i>

181
00:18:25,621 --> 00:18:28,098
<i> and removes the entrails and the abstract </ i>

182
00:18:28,135 --> 00:18:30,044
<i> from the dragon's throat. </ i>

183
00:18:32,696 --> 00:18:34,562
<i> He was also our cook. </ i>

184
00:18:35,018 --> 00:18:36,687
<i> And a very bad cook too. </ i>

185
00:18:49,738 --> 00:18:51,724
Then there is <i>, Rachel. </ i>

186
00:18:51,999 --> 00:18:53,821
<i> Always the captains daughter. </ i>

187
00:18:54,498 --> 00:18:57,748
Always <i> into themselves and hard,
if they never be broken. </ i>

188
00:19:04,582 --> 00:19:07,178
I gotta show you something.

189
00:19:10,591 --> 00:19:12,838
The world runs on this fluid.

190
00:19:12,872 --> 00:19:15,545
It's just before we
market to sell.

191
00:19:15,573 --> 00:19:19,741
If it comes into contact with air
it will explode.

192
00:19:36,032 --> 00:19:40,822
But our boss and dictator <i> have
I have not seen. </ i>

193
00:19:47,890 --> 00:19:50,291
<i> He sits in his cabin cold bent
his cards ...</ i>

194
00:19:50,345 --> 00:19:54,207
<i> made and full of notes
conquests of his long years. </ i>

195
00:19:54,982 --> 00:19:57,197
Every morning he <i> Rachel
the course to follow. </ i>

196
00:19:59,229 --> 00:20:01,476
<i> because he stays within his skin. </ i>

197
00:20:01,806 --> 00:20:04,861
<i> If he comes in the daylight,
he must be completely covered. </ i>

198
00:20:09,197 --> 00:20:12,142
<i> Every night we share a meal together. </ i>

199
00:20:20,268 --> 00:20:22,516
The food is bad.

200
00:20:30,038 --> 00:20:32,821
I think you have feelings
Lens damage.

201
00:20:37,454 --> 00:20:39,669
Tell us a story Mr. Stubb.

202
00:20:39,713 --> 00:20:42,343
You have all my stories
heard, Mr. Starbuck.

203
00:20:42,571 --> 00:20:43,553
Not me.

204
00:20:44,567 --> 00:20:46,477
Well, I remember my first hunt.

205
00:20:49,013 --> 00:20:51,030
On a beautiful woman with ...

206
00:20:51,421 --> 00:20:54,290
No, you gave us that all too often told.

207
00:20:56,599 --> 00:20:58,738
Tell us a story dragon Rachel.

208
00:20:59,963 --> 00:21:02,592
Well ...
Tell them about the fight with Vadamoica.

209
00:21:13,541 --> 00:21:18,330
Before I signed with Ahab
I was first to measure a vehicle ...

210
00:21:18,752 --> 00:21:21,926
Vadamoica called.

211
00:21:23,374 --> 00:21:24,738
I was young.

212
00:21:25,616 --> 00:21:29,522
It was before the dragons,
came to the woods and fields.

213
00:21:31,857 --> 00:21:34,454
When you first turn on your dragon spear
to throw ...

214
00:21:34,475 --> 00:21:37,421
are you shaking with fear.

215
00:21:38,739 --> 00:21:40,408
You stand there ...

216
00:21:42,415 --> 00:21:46,005
and the weight of your
harpoon feels like 40 pounds.

217
00:21:47,008 --> 00:21:49,834
You're shaking in your shoes

218
00:21:50,797 --> 00:21:52,859
and when you throw your spear
it feels ...

219
00:21:52,893 --> 00:21:55,293
or your lungs explode.

220
00:21:57,081 --> 00:21:59,296
A man fought with me ...
a good man.

221
00:21:59,310 --> 00:22:03,292
You remember him
or not Mr. Starbuck?

222
00:22:03,711 --> 00:22:04,813
Yes.

223
00:22:05,296 --> 00:22:09,202
Burning,
in a flash by the breath of the dragon.

224
00:22:09,932 --> 00:22:11,903
His skin was roasted ...
black and pink before our eyes.

225
00:22:16,767 --> 00:22:19,745
He shriveled down to his knees ...

226
00:22:20,539 --> 00:22:24,631
he was screaming for me
throw throw ... he yelled.

227
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:28,281
And with the power of Almighty God,

228
00:22:28,711 --> 00:22:31,918
I threw my spear at the beast.

229
00:22:33,628 --> 00:22:36,727
Hit him right here ...
well embedded in his skin.

230
00:22:38,388 --> 00:22:42,861
He collapsed and was
a final battle ...

231
00:22:42,898 --> 00:22:45,035
its wings.

232
00:22:46,262 --> 00:22:49,437
I heard a cry of joy
right for us.

233
00:22:49,869 --> 00:22:53,273
I do not know where
came from boys ...

234
00:22:54,297 --> 00:22:58,006
Despite his pain looked
Whitman on to me ...

235
00:22:58,493 --> 00:23:00,130
and laughed.

236
00:23:02,419 --> 00:23:05,594
He had seen the pitch before he died.

237
00:23:07,687 --> 00:23:12,127
And that was the story of a dragon hunter.

238
00:23:18,356 --> 00:23:22,491
At Whitman.
On Withman a fine man.

239
00:23:28,026 --> 00:23:31,125
Well, boy let me now first
story ...

240
00:23:31,155 --> 00:23:34,865
of that beauty with thick ...

241
00:23:42,046 --> 00:23:44,567
Every night after <i> Stubb's stories
we went to bed </ i>

242
00:23:44,579 --> 00:23:46,489
<i> safe in the belly of the vehicle. </ i>

243
00:24:46,133 --> 00:24:49,112
<i> I wondered in what strange adventure
I had arrived. </ i>

244
00:24:49,828 --> 00:24:53,461
<i> what constituted for me ...
in this journey. </ i>

245
00:24:53,701 --> 00:24:57,062
<i> days of my life
wasted by killing. </ i>

246
00:24:57,321 --> 00:25:00,881
<i> that's what I hear from Ahab. </ i>

247
00:25:01,468 --> 00:25:04,249
<i> running up and down on the deck at night. </ i>

248
00:25:04,271 --> 00:25:07,054
<i> Always looking for the dragon who opjoeg. </ i>

249
00:25:14,903 --> 00:25:19,649
<i> And then came the day that he knew
that he had to inspect our souls. </ i>

250
00:25:42,998 --> 00:25:47,089
Mr. Starbuck? Gather the team.

251
00:25:48,058 --> 00:25:49,771
Rachel get the drink.

252
00:26:40,354 --> 00:26:45,297
Tomorrow we will arrive on the battlefield.

253
00:26:45,319 --> 00:26:48,373
You will all be rich
after this hunt.

254
00:26:52,698 --> 00:26:55,720
But listen to me!

255
00:26:56,078 --> 00:26:59,864
I will double the amount
the first man ...

256
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:03,002
that impales the white dragon.

257
00:27:03,422 --> 00:27:06,019
No, I triple the amount.

258
00:27:07,994 --> 00:27:13,121
Keep your eyes open and observe.
- Captain?

259
00:27:13,417 --> 00:27:17,279
Was not the white dragon
that you burned?

260
00:27:17,998 --> 00:27:19,481
Cripple you made?

261
00:27:25,612 --> 00:27:29,245
Yes. - Mr. Starbuck.

262
00:27:30,239 --> 00:27:33,371
You know all too well that
the cursed beast it was.

263
00:27:33,412 --> 00:27:37,885
And I will hunt him about any hill.

264
00:27:38,284 --> 00:27:42,223
Even by hellfire
that's what we need to do ...

265
00:27:42,268 --> 00:27:45,290
the white dragon detection impale ...

266
00:27:45,317 --> 00:27:48,339
He spits up black blood.

267
00:27:48,380 --> 00:27:50,670
Do you understand?
- Yes. - Yes. - Yes.

268
00:27:50,701 --> 00:27:56,103
Captain, you know very well
I dare my life.

269
00:27:56,129 --> 00:28:00,527
But I also came to hunt
and rich. Not for Adventure.

270
00:28:00,752 --> 00:28:04,002
How many lives have your revenge
whether or not cost?

271
00:28:04,031 --> 00:28:06,475
You do not reproach me.

272
00:28:06,725 --> 00:28:08,852
I did what I wanted
and I do what I want.

273
00:28:14,965 --> 00:28:18,403
That damned beast has cluttered up
with blind rage.

274
00:28:18,892 --> 00:28:23,136
To seek revenge on such a sample is crazy.

275
00:28:23,166 --> 00:28:25,337
Go ahead call me crazy ...

276
00:28:25,366 --> 00:28:29,960
I would still chase the sun
he would offend me.

277
00:28:29,973 --> 00:28:32,569
Rachel bring the drinks!

278
00:28:34,937 --> 00:28:40,446
Drink and swear peer
chase the white dragon ...

279
00:28:40,462 --> 00:28:43,976
until his death.
Now drinking Harpo down managers.

280
00:28:45,866 --> 00:28:48,768
Well done, almost excellent.

281
00:29:01,083 --> 00:29:01,879
Now, Mr. Starbuck!

282
00:30:03,018 --> 00:30:06,040
It was Rachel who <i> us
led to the drakenhol. </ i>

283
00:30:11,745 --> 00:30:15,881
<i> She had half a sense gift
dragons to detect. </ i>

284
00:30:26,586 --> 00:30:31,027
<i> It was my fear that I or one,
Another way was to get under control. </ i>

285
00:30:31,071 --> 00:30:36,351
<i> Fear freezes you ...
paralysis of spirit and brains. </ i>

286
00:30:37,593 --> 00:30:41,259
<i> I tried to find them but I
never seen a dragon. </ i>

287
00:30:49,008 --> 00:30:50,034
Stubb!

288
00:30:51,974 --> 00:30:53,338
I got it.

289
00:30:59,795 --> 00:31:01,508
Hey, get.

290
00:31:05,976 --> 00:31:09,336
Throw throw now, what are you waiting for?

291
00:31:09,372 --> 00:31:11,008
Throw your harpoon.

292
00:31:12,092 --> 00:31:13,957
Step out and throw guy.

293
00:31:15,257 --> 00:31:17,243
Stubb, swim away!

294
00:31:53,928 --> 00:31:55,717
Starbuck get this off me.

295
00:31:58,580 --> 00:32:00,981
Ishmael throw!

296
00:32:06,315 --> 00:32:08,409
I grabbed him and go back Starbuck.

297
00:32:11,599 --> 00:32:15,112
Want my dirty bastard?

298
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:21,954
Now you are against any animal cope.

299
00:34:24,475 --> 00:34:25,762
Aside.

300
00:35:26,205 --> 00:35:28,605
His pipe went out anyway.
Goodbye best Stubb.

301
00:35:30,484 --> 00:35:32,153
He loved life.

302
00:35:32,542 --> 00:35:34,211
Laughing at life.

303
00:35:34,733 --> 00:35:36,751
You told me this
the only answer ...

304
00:35:36,792 --> 00:35:38,276
at all strange.

305
00:35:39,329 --> 00:35:43,617
We hunted together in faraway countries wanted.

306
00:35:43,830 --> 00:35:49,417
He did not
he loved hunting.

307
00:35:50,192 --> 00:35:53,170
Now he sits at the dinner
together with the devil.

308
00:35:53,629 --> 00:35:58,528
I think we all eventually
Rachel will do.

309
00:36:51,336 --> 00:36:54,358
Captain?
- Come in, Mr.. Starbuck.

310
00:36:56,272 --> 00:36:57,941
How's the crew?

311
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:02,067
Mourning for the loss of Stubb.

312
00:37:03,069 --> 00:37:07,205
That is the risk of your profession Mr. Starbuck.

313
00:37:08,173 --> 00:37:10,803
You live your life as you want.

314
00:37:10,850 --> 00:37:14,637
Yes, but ...
- You do it included with death.

315
00:37:15,439 --> 00:37:19,837
Is your lovely wife or daughter
ever returned ...

316
00:37:19,874 --> 00:37:21,967
in order to console you?

317
00:37:22,682 --> 00:37:24,700
No, Captain.

318
00:37:25,016 --> 00:37:27,001
And they will not.

319
00:37:28,252 --> 00:37:30,434
So forget those memories
the last battlefield.

320
00:37:39,287 --> 00:37:42,069
I've hunted all my life dragons.

321
00:37:42,553 --> 00:37:44,889
I know and can feel
my hand that we are close.

322
00:37:58,591 --> 00:38:00,914
We can load up our car
with fuel,

323
00:38:00,951 --> 00:38:04,050
and are back for spring.

324
00:38:04,062 --> 00:38:07,347
Not until we have completed
the bigger things.

325
00:38:08,497 --> 00:38:13,624
He goes northward to the mountains to
to get clogs.

326
00:38:14,612 --> 00:38:17,667
It moves faster
than in other years.

327
00:38:18,368 --> 00:38:22,078
Centuries, as it feels for me.

328
00:38:25,896 --> 00:38:29,836
I'll show you where we
have an appointment.

329
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:44,710
You had to throw earlier.

330
00:38:46,616 --> 00:38:49,137
On Mr.. Stubb.

331
00:38:52,679 --> 00:38:56,585
He's right, I had
overdue throw.

332
00:38:58,691 --> 00:39:03,284
You impaled by the dragon's heart
Stubb's what it wants to remember.

333
00:39:06,378 --> 00:39:09,739
Does not he drink?
- He prefers his pipe.

334
00:39:11,525 --> 00:39:14,231
He is at peace with his soul.

335
00:39:15,010 --> 00:39:17,223
You know each other already?

336
00:39:18,242 --> 00:39:20,795
Yes we have traveled the world together.

337
00:39:22,117 --> 00:39:23,983
Seen a lot.

338
00:39:24,393 --> 00:39:26,215
Mysterious and strange.

339
00:39:28,636 --> 00:39:30,928
But nothing is like today ...

340
00:39:32,363 --> 00:39:36,990
or as a woman, as you.

341
00:39:39,921 --> 00:39:45,125
Forgive me.
I have too much to drink.

342
00:39:49,410 --> 00:39:51,504
Hold on!

343
00:39:56,578 --> 00:39:59,939
And will I ever hear your story?

344
00:40:03,130 --> 00:40:07,832
My mother died at my birth.

345
00:40:09,220 --> 00:40:11,359
My father was slain when I was eight.

346
00:40:12,323 --> 00:40:15,913
For Ahab, Starbuck was my father's
first measure.

347
00:40:17,306 --> 00:40:20,175
In the mountains they came
the white dragon ...

348
00:40:20,188 --> 00:40:23,090
Ahab told me that my father,

349
00:40:23,111 --> 00:40:24,398
who first pitched.

350
00:40:24,424 --> 00:40:26,791
He threw a harpoon straight into the beast.

351
00:40:28,061 --> 00:40:30,004
Ahab has tried to save him.

352
00:40:32,503 --> 00:40:35,253
Harpoon Irish are heavy curses.

353
00:40:36,392 --> 00:40:40,408
Sorry! I did not know.

354
00:40:42,509 --> 00:40:44,493
Ahab has adopted me as his own.

355
00:40:45,067 --> 00:40:47,206
Since then he takes me along on every hunt.

356
00:40:48,613 --> 00:40:53,086
Ishmael, you hope that Ahab
you do not see ...

357
00:40:53,330 --> 00:40:56,887
you seduced his daughter.
- I'm sick of you!

358
00:40:56,934 --> 00:40:59,564
Oh fuck up!

359
00:41:06,410 --> 00:41:11,003
If you are not looking and your boyfriend
is not there ...

360
00:41:11,315 --> 00:41:14,261
I will cut ...
- Then I have something for you ...

361
00:41:14,826 --> 00:41:19,529
Ishmael quietly we sleep outside tonight.

362
00:41:25,568 --> 00:41:29,889
If you touch him I chop your head off.

363
00:41:39,406 --> 00:41:42,843
This is where we will find him.

364
00:41:43,269 --> 00:41:47,709
We will impale him and I will
his mask back stabbing.

365
00:41:48,950 --> 00:41:54,537
I will then the white dragon
his narrator are ...

366
00:41:55,074 --> 00:41:59,210
his teacher.
I put my head into that.

367
00:41:59,531 --> 00:42:01,976
And this is my friend the harpoon ...
I have the white dragon ...

368
00:42:06,606 --> 00:42:08,853
threw his skull.

369
00:42:09,995 --> 00:42:12,349
I have not slain this time
I will not fail.

370
00:42:16,685 --> 00:42:20,351
Captain? They are too many years ...

371
00:42:20,681 --> 00:42:23,855
too many years and when you only
but pursues ...

372
00:42:23,881 --> 00:42:26,477
The crew will come with me.
- They swear their souls away ...

373
00:42:26,515 --> 00:42:27,693
as dog food.

374
00:42:27,734 --> 00:42:32,284
Like you did, Mr.. Starbuck
just like you did.

375
00:42:36,497 --> 00:42:41,515
Well, you're with me or against me?

376
00:42:45,104 --> 00:42:47,701
You do not fear
for Mr. Starbuck.

377
00:42:51,324 --> 00:42:56,191
But Ahab ... you should watch out for Ahab.

378
00:42:57,037 --> 00:43:00,824
Rachel tell her that I
will give a new direction.

379
00:43:35,514 --> 00:43:38,220
And so we left <i>
The hunting grounds Grijse windy </ i>

380
00:43:38,777 --> 00:43:41,025
<i> the country and went into the Dragon-Slayers. </ i>

381
00:43:50,029 --> 00:43:51,207
We're being followed.

382
00:43:51,469 --> 00:43:54,829
I see him all day,
when I am posting at night.

383
00:43:58,752 --> 00:44:01,305
It will be an individual's
who hunt dragons.

384
00:44:01,339 --> 00:44:03,205
Have you already been in other countries?

385
00:44:03,253 --> 00:44:05,042
A couple of times with Ahab.

386
00:44:07,058 --> 00:44:09,075
You should be careful with Flask.

387
00:44:10,139 --> 00:44:11,807
Why?

388
00:44:12,979 --> 00:44:14,615
In the beginning, he
harpooner us ...

389
00:44:14,645 --> 00:44:16,936
but the animals could not face.

390
00:44:17,709 --> 00:44:19,771
He hit him when he
first had to throw ...

391
00:44:19,794 --> 00:44:22,161
Ahab wants him to forget it.

392
00:44:23,145 --> 00:44:27,007
Ahab hates cowards.
He can not tolerate their fear.

393
00:44:28,239 --> 00:44:31,370
He left Flask remain as abstractor.

394
00:44:31,741 --> 00:44:36,214
He wants this thankless job because
he is very close to Rachel.

395
00:44:36,490 --> 00:44:38,557
Now he wants a fight?
- No, he already has one.

396
00:44:43,669 --> 00:44:48,917
I'm going for a piece and you're with me.

397
00:44:58,430 --> 00:45:00,983
There are visible dragons.

398
00:45:01,870 --> 00:45:04,118
They hunt in the woods.

399
00:45:08,789 --> 00:45:11,002
Starbucks says they are teasing you.

400
00:45:12,044 --> 00:45:14,335
I'll be sleepwalking.

401
00:45:15,442 --> 00:45:18,115
Yes. - Will it go up to something?

402
00:45:18,436 --> 00:45:21,186
Well, we know each other yet
good enough. Not yet.

403
00:45:22,314 --> 00:45:25,182
Not yet? - What about you?

404
00:45:26,650 --> 00:45:30,087
I have no posse in my soul.
- Yes, you do.

405
00:45:31,244 --> 00:45:33,917
How long have you let us send by Ahab?

406
00:45:35,364 --> 00:45:38,113
If you have something different with women.

407
00:45:39,950 --> 00:45:43,508
You have to admit that you love
what to leave in the lurch.

408
00:45:43,906 --> 00:45:49,263
No, all I have to admit
is that you're really there for me.

409
00:45:49,481 --> 00:45:52,428
Is that why you my
wants to avenge father's death?

410
00:45:53,090 --> 00:45:56,189
My father that she always wisdom
and sadness do not go together.

411
00:45:56,945 --> 00:45:59,542
Sadness but also counts.

412
00:45:59,821 --> 00:46:04,610
Your father?
- Yes, he committed suicide ...

413
00:46:04,860 --> 00:46:06,421
when I was ten.

414
00:46:07,419 --> 00:46:10,398
My mother went though
they only could handle ...

415
00:46:11,059 --> 00:46:14,724
but there are lesions that
do not recover.

416
00:46:14,747 --> 00:46:15,805
And?

417
00:46:19,134 --> 00:46:23,270
I had to bury her
and m `s older brother took me to his house.

418
00:46:23,759 --> 00:46:26,662
But his wife do not like me.

419
00:46:28,197 --> 00:46:30,903
So I crept away with the mine caravan.

420
00:46:30,936 --> 00:46:33,380
And you filled your pockets with gold?

421
00:46:33,630 --> 00:46:36,532
I found only empty dreams.

422
00:46:38,719 --> 00:46:42,461
Until I met Queequeg,
He was the hunter of the caravan.

423
00:46:42,712 --> 00:46:45,691
Everyone kept alive by
his skill with his spear.

424
00:46:46,226 --> 00:46:48,048
He was my teacher.

425
00:46:50,003 --> 00:46:54,945
And friend.
- And shared your hunting area?

426
00:46:57,117 --> 00:46:57,836
Yes.

427
00:46:58,110 --> 00:47:01,820
Well poet, what can you tell me
on your travels?

428
00:47:07,912 --> 00:47:10,934
The presence of negotiations
drunks ...

429
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:14,899
fraud, deceit, murder and kidnapping ...

430
00:47:15,370 --> 00:47:18,773
All that is behind the death.

431
00:47:19,297 --> 00:47:21,664
You realize that, for death.

432
00:47:21,702 --> 00:47:25,292
Love ... personal things
are the only ones worth something.

433
00:47:31,178 --> 00:47:36,808
It is nice to receive interest

434
00:47:37,733 --> 00:47:43,483
if you meet it.
You'll encounter all Rachel.

435
00:48:15,089 --> 00:48:18,799
Pure as snow, but I felt this thing.

436
00:48:19,876 --> 00:48:21,839
Be on your guard.
The mark of the beast.

437
00:48:27,674 --> 00:48:29,736
Ready Made before his crucifixion.

438
00:48:30,167 --> 00:48:34,836
I'm torn.
You can see it all.

439
00:48:35,396 --> 00:48:37,648
The Sacrifice ...
the shame ... the great white dragon.

440
00:48:42,871 --> 00:48:47,311
He just grabs and kills his own kind.

441
00:48:49,638 --> 00:48:52,813
But it's him or me.

442
00:48:55,523 --> 00:48:57,799
Starbuck see you now
as I showed you on the map.

443
00:49:04,510 --> 00:49:06,986
Let us go back.

444
00:49:12,543 --> 00:49:14,026
<i> There is an anger in some souls </ i>

445
00:49:14,054 --> 00:49:16,302
<i> that goes so deep into the darkest fields, </ i>

446
00:49:16,748 --> 00:49:18,842
<i> surrounded by death. </ i>

447
00:49:18,892 --> 00:49:22,144
They fly all over <i> elusive creatures. </ i>

448
00:49:23,132 --> 00:49:25,761
<i> Queequeg and I are trapped
In Ahab's vengeance. </ i>

449
00:49:53,708 --> 00:49:56,381
It feels like we are trapped.

450
00:50:01,118 --> 00:50:03,593
We would have to go away.

451
00:50:05,787 --> 00:50:06,997
For Rachel.

452
00:50:11,327 --> 00:50:15,069
Your two up, now.

453
00:50:20,102 --> 00:50:23,583
Mr. Starbuck and I will
our last trip plans ...

454
00:50:23,620 --> 00:50:25,868
through the mountain.

455
00:50:25,895 --> 00:50:28,492
You have until the morning, Rachel.

456
00:50:40,182 --> 00:50:43,083
How much?
- Enough to keep the richest ...

457
00:50:43,126 --> 00:50:44,610
husband.

458
00:50:49,058 --> 00:50:53,880
Females ...
It seems that at least thirty.

459
00:50:54,197 --> 00:50:55,528
Could be.

460
00:50:56,474 --> 00:50:59,376
We only have until the morning.
Then we should go.

461
00:50:59,980 --> 00:51:03,035
Why? This is what we came.

462
00:51:03,072 --> 00:51:06,094
We can fill our packing space
alone of this fold.

463
00:51:06,322 --> 00:51:09,146
Ahab has commissioned
kill them all.

464
00:54:33,774 --> 00:54:37,178
You have them all slain Rachel?

465
00:54:44,365 --> 00:54:46,995
Mr. Hurry. Flask!

466
00:54:53,009 --> 00:54:56,870
Starbuck!
I said stop, Mr. Flask.

467
00:54:56,917 --> 00:54:59,470
Captain we have the necessary oil-Fitri.

468
00:54:59,951 --> 00:55:01,773
Look!

469
00:55:08,377 --> 00:55:13,353
Hey ...
Did I not tell you.

470
00:55:13,764 --> 00:55:16,055
Did I not tell Mr. Starbuck?

471
00:55:16,367 --> 00:55:18,155
You did.

472
00:55:19,106 --> 00:55:21,701
Get on board. We must go.

473
00:55:22,121 --> 00:55:23,986
With all the oil-Fitri?

474
00:55:24,024 --> 00:55:26,042
Too late. We have to go right now.

475
00:55:26,701 --> 00:55:28,719
We must follow him to his nest.

476
00:55:34,264 --> 00:55:37,930
Queequeg? Queequeg?
- It's a sign.

477
00:55:38,913 --> 00:55:41,587
I will die in a short time.

478
00:55:44,848 --> 00:55:47,061
Has everyone gone mad?

479
00:55:47,593 --> 00:55:49,917
We have not slain.

480
00:55:52,405 --> 00:55:56,344
The white dragon has come
to tell me ...

481
00:56:02,554 --> 00:56:04,878
I'm a murderer ...

482
00:56:07,123 --> 00:56:09,993
and did nothing all slaughtered.

483
00:56:16,378 --> 00:56:18,854
I must die.

484
00:56:30,445 --> 00:56:34,427
We can not just go away.
- Of course we can.

485
00:56:35,815 --> 00:56:37,724
It's silly to go away.

486
00:56:38,438 --> 00:56:39,954
Captain may have
we think about it.

487
00:56:40,001 --> 00:56:41,987
You know what to do Mr. Starbuck.

488
00:56:42,008 --> 00:56:46,406
That's what we came and all
animals have been slaughtered.

489
00:56:46,726 --> 00:56:51,548
It was the oil-Fitri.
- Are you questioning my orders?

490
00:56:51,587 --> 00:56:54,183
So we have not slain?

491
00:56:54,882 --> 00:56:56,442
There is enough oil-Fitri by killing ...

492
00:56:56,734 --> 00:56:59,178
for the rest of your life rich.

493
00:56:59,212 --> 00:57:01,579
That is why we
that journey.

494
00:57:01,848 --> 00:57:05,328
You think I will survive year after year ...

495
00:57:05,726 --> 00:57:09,392
dragging and struggling, and yes slaughter ...

496
00:57:09,421 --> 00:57:13,131
for the money or admit
in negotiations?

497
00:57:16,581 --> 00:57:18,566
Do you think I want?

498
00:57:18,583 --> 00:57:23,406
You think I wear body
knock on this barren land ...

499
00:57:23,675 --> 00:57:28,618
For more than you are alive ...
hollo me the attraction of death?

500
00:57:28,625 --> 00:57:30,637
After years I decided, despite
the humiliation ...

501
00:57:35,584 --> 00:57:39,250
return to the marketplace ...

502
00:57:39,289 --> 00:57:43,686
to stay alive for another year.

503
00:57:44,332 --> 00:57:49,351
Before I got a chance so I
the white dragon can kill.

504
00:57:50,049 --> 00:57:53,409
I will not be stopped
my goal.

505
00:57:53,442 --> 00:57:58,418
I will stop you.
How ... without your guard ...

506
00:57:58,734 --> 00:58:01,482
Where did he go?

507
00:58:02,389 --> 00:58:04,757
He's in a trance.

508
00:58:05,205 --> 00:58:09,525
He will not save you.
I kind of already happened.

509
00:58:09,548 --> 00:58:12,330
They withdraw into themselves back ...

510
00:58:12,386 --> 00:58:15,866
if they violated their ancient habits.

511
00:58:16,392 --> 00:58:18,638
I will not tolerate mutiny.

512
00:58:19,117 --> 00:58:22,096
Make his arms together
Mr. fixed. Starbuck ...

513
00:58:22,350 --> 00:58:26,639
and chain him to the back.

514
00:58:29,932 --> 00:58:32,801
Mr. Flask, grab the chains.

515
00:58:34,048 --> 00:58:35,150
With pleasure.

516
00:58:38,703 --> 00:58:41,802
Captain!
- Rachel, no!

517
00:58:42,962 --> 00:58:45,515
Together we have come this far.

518
00:58:46,494 --> 00:58:49,015
This is the beast that killed your father.

519
00:58:49,470 --> 00:58:53,377
He teases us and challenge us.

520
00:58:53,404 --> 00:58:56,535
He knows we want to kill.

521
00:58:56,560 --> 00:58:59,887
Now you bring the vehicle in motion.

522
00:59:12,933 --> 00:59:16,032
Why? Why did you betray me?

523
00:59:16,307 --> 00:59:18,784
I loved you like a son.

524
00:59:19,434 --> 00:59:22,183
Beware of yourself old man!

525
00:59:36,162 --> 00:59:38,489
There is only one God, and
a captain on this vehicle.

526
00:59:45,518 --> 00:59:47,503
You had to warn me!

527
00:59:50,299 --> 00:59:55,046
But I forgive you Rachel.
Just as I am your father forgave.

528
00:59:58,122 --> 01:00:01,908
I told you that I get.

529
01:00:04,753 --> 01:00:07,535
Imprisoned, chained and
at the rear of the vehicle.

530
01:00:07,970 --> 01:00:11,025
By some twisted fate
a kind of retaliation.

531
01:00:11,069 --> 01:00:13,544
To let me lead to forgiveness?

532
01:00:13,909 --> 01:00:17,696
I do not know.
But I know I hated Ahab.

533
01:00:18,747 --> 01:00:20,886
I hated that fucking old man.

534
01:00:23,422 --> 01:00:26,858
You take the second?
Look to the deck if we followed.

535
01:00:28,860 --> 01:00:32,647
Yes, I have already told people
seen going into a trance ...

536
01:00:32,660 --> 01:00:34,722
just like this for days.

537
01:00:35,193 --> 01:00:39,742
Ichmail, should not have done.
He had to expect.

538
01:00:39,780 --> 01:00:43,031
Like Starbuck, Ahab wanted stabbing down.

539
01:00:43,297 --> 01:00:45,359
Ahab will let him back inside.

540
01:00:49,683 --> 01:00:53,970
The captain will let him back inside.

541
01:00:54,528 --> 01:00:58,544
It's ...
It's just we do, Rachel.

542
01:01:00,029 --> 01:01:04,164
Do you understand that?
- Ishmael, our spear throwing.

543
01:01:04,204 --> 01:01:06,495
Ahab needs him.

544
01:01:20,385 --> 01:01:22,753
Ishmael, you got to eat.

545
01:01:22,791 --> 01:01:24,809
Ahab wants you all
not have out here.

546
01:01:25,095 --> 01:01:27,801
I do not want you out here are.

547
01:01:29,108 --> 01:01:31,354
Please talk with him once.

548
01:01:31,904 --> 01:01:34,457
You can come along and inside
discuss with him.

549
01:01:34,476 --> 01:01:37,957
Rachel Starbuck he has slain.

550
01:01:37,993 --> 01:01:40,164
Starbucks wanted to murder him.

551
01:01:42,109 --> 01:01:45,164
Do not you understand?
- No, you do not understand.

552
01:01:45,536 --> 01:01:49,628
This is Ahab's vehicle.
He responded in self-defense.

553
01:01:49,932 --> 01:01:54,176
Rachel, I care about you.

554
01:01:58,237 --> 01:02:01,795
If that is true you to come inside,

555
01:02:01,843 --> 01:02:04,167
and talk to the Captain.

556
01:02:09,864 --> 01:02:12,886
There is no talk
with someone who's crazy.

557
01:04:32,113 --> 01:04:35,900
Ahab? - What's going on?
- They steal the oil-Fitri.

558
01:05:35,617 --> 01:05:37,482
Rachel?

559
01:05:59,198 --> 01:06:02,101
Ishmael can come on board.

560
01:06:03,131 --> 01:06:05,651
He has earned for itself.

561
01:06:06,798 --> 01:06:09,044
Bring me my spear back.

562
01:06:10,137 --> 01:06:12,123
Yes, sir.

563
01:06:17,392 --> 01:06:21,407
Do you stay or leave us Queequeg?

564
01:06:21,988 --> 01:06:24,857
... It is time to decide.

565
01:06:24,902 --> 01:06:26,571
To decide what?

566
01:06:27,158 --> 01:06:30,105
You follow?

567
01:06:30,682 --> 01:06:34,773
An old man who damaged his
fears chasing.

568
01:06:34,809 --> 01:06:37,439
Grab your share and leave.

569
01:06:37,482 --> 01:06:39,958
We stood in a field of carnage.

570
01:06:43,137 --> 01:06:45,428
Why did you let them out?

571
01:06:45,474 --> 01:06:50,263
You fucking psychopath. You've just
slain more than I will ever do.

572
01:06:50,965 --> 01:06:53,369
I am a killer, I kill only
what I needed.

573
01:06:58,763 --> 01:07:01,894
You know all too well.

574
01:07:02,543 --> 01:07:04,798
For I must now pay.
I have offended the gods.

575
01:07:10,550 --> 01:07:11,314
Gods ... Gods.

576
01:07:16,248 --> 01:07:18,997
Sun moves by itself?
Or is there anyone up there ...

577
01:07:19,287 --> 01:07:21,917
some god?

578
01:07:22,171 --> 01:07:24,725
Seems a star by itself ...

579
01:07:24,985 --> 01:07:28,160
or he is guided by some
invisible power?

580
01:07:28,192 --> 01:07:30,516
How can one little heart beat by itself?

581
01:07:30,548 --> 01:07:34,139
How brains can think for themselves?

582
01:07:34,995 --> 01:07:39,544
In all those years Queequeg
you that you have wondered.

583
01:07:39,916 --> 01:07:41,826
Like me.

584
01:07:41,850 --> 01:07:44,251
And who will want to try us.

585
01:07:44,538 --> 01:07:48,051
Where do murderers go Queequeg?

586
01:07:48,087 --> 01:07:50,989
Where? Damn.

587
01:07:51,362 --> 01:07:53,686
You're driven, I am passionate ...

588
01:07:54,771 --> 01:07:57,793
the fate of our own will.

589
01:08:00,144 --> 01:08:03,471
Therefore, we all suffer?

590
01:08:33,493 --> 01:08:34,976
Rachel?

591
01:08:36,984 --> 01:08:39,155
We must anchor here.

592
01:08:50,191 --> 01:08:52,745
Ishmael.
Queequeg.

593
01:09:01,303 --> 01:09:04,325
Why are we stopping?
- Furthermore, we can not.

594
01:09:04,738 --> 01:09:06,527
The rest we can walk.

595
01:09:06,576 --> 01:09:10,591
You must lower the anchors
of the vehicle ... they are frozen.

596
01:09:17,397 --> 01:09:18,684
There.

597
01:10:30,495 --> 01:10:33,823
I want you, I need you.

598
01:10:48,580 --> 01:10:51,679
You know. - I kill you!

599
01:10:52,086 --> 01:10:55,490
Nobody can hear us.

600
01:11:45,198 --> 01:11:48,067
You have to come with me as
you give to Rachel.

601
01:11:48,957 --> 01:11:50,867
I know you do.

602
01:11:51,899 --> 01:11:54,038
He does not come along.

603
01:11:59,278 --> 01:12:00,991
Yes I must do.

604
01:12:01,040 --> 01:12:04,215
We must come face Tanis.

605
01:12:04,495 --> 01:12:08,554
You gotta help me this
dragon hunt in his nest.

606
01:12:09,673 --> 01:12:11,691
I need you, Ishmael.

607
01:12:12,142 --> 01:12:14,084
Rachel needs you.

608
01:12:14,135 --> 01:12:16,274
We will never again get this chance.

609
01:12:17,116 --> 01:12:19,287
I've never been so close to ...

610
01:12:19,336 --> 01:12:22,010
to meet our father.

611
01:13:29,340 --> 01:13:32,778
You need me ... not protect Ishmael.

612
01:13:34,260 --> 01:13:35,547
I know.

613
01:13:39,114 --> 01:13:41,634
But I want to do this.

614
01:13:42,926 --> 01:13:44,869
For you.

615
01:15:25,758 --> 01:15:27,820
<i> And so we followed Ahab. </ i>

616
01:15:27,835 --> 01:15:30,617
<i> Climbing up to the dragon's nest. </ i>

617
01:15:30,661 --> 01:15:33,683
<i> to the caves of death. </ i>

618
01:15:33,728 --> 01:15:38,595
<i> Fiquay, followed us even though he
he ran to meet his death. </ i>

619
01:15:39,577 --> 01:15:41,322
<i> He was closer to something
which he had ever believed </ i>

620
01:15:41,356 --> 01:15:44,531
<i> that he would not survive. </ i>

621
01:16:35,978 --> 01:16:38,683
I know another entrance to the nest.

622
01:16:39,052 --> 01:16:40,154
Okay.

623
01:16:43,042 --> 01:16:48,169
Ishmael I can not go with you.

624
01:16:49,503 --> 01:16:52,863
I see.
- I'll stay here.

625
01:16:54,384 --> 01:16:56,558
I pray for you.
- I'll be right back.

626
01:18:12,500 --> 01:18:14,943
Monitor the roof.

627
01:18:14,960 --> 01:18:17,785
We need to lure him here.

628
01:19:45,286 --> 01:19:47,108
Rachel?

629
01:19:56,428 --> 01:19:58,064
Rachel?

630
01:20:35,599 --> 01:20:40,301
All those years you told me
the dragon that killed my father ...

631
01:20:40,340 --> 01:20:42,358
while it was you!

632
01:20:43,397 --> 01:20:47,761
I thought he now
to dust was gone.

633
01:20:48,151 --> 01:20:53,280
Do not you dare lie to me
that's your harpoon in his back.

634
01:20:54,106 --> 01:20:56,201
He was a coward.

635
01:20:56,466 --> 01:20:58,866
He deserved to die.

636
01:21:04,127 --> 01:21:09,484
I would accept and not cowardice.
- So you killed him ...

637
01:21:09,527 --> 01:21:12,276
not surprising because he wanted to be like you?

638
01:21:12,288 --> 01:21:14,884
Where do murderers go Ahab?

639
01:21:14,907 --> 01:21:18,192
He ran, he would not himself
under the eyes.

640
01:21:18,571 --> 01:21:20,637
Fearfulness. Can you not understand that, Rachel?

641
01:21:28,787 --> 01:21:30,730
That is why I return.

642
01:21:34,418 --> 01:21:36,131
I was ...

643
01:21:40,292 --> 01:21:42,431
I ran ...

644
01:21:52,944 --> 01:21:53,631
<i> ICEM </ i>

645
01:22:04,752 --> 01:22:06,159
I ran away.

646
01:22:11,738 --> 01:22:14,182
She was still alive.

647
01:22:14,954 --> 01:22:17,438
But I was afraid
and was a coward, ran away ...

648
01:22:32,980 --> 01:22:35,255
I can not ... escape the screams.

649
01:22:48,536 --> 01:22:52,671
I ... I can not ...

650
01:22:52,679 --> 01:22:54,818
like a coward.

651
01:23:11,449 --> 01:23:19,154
I ... will therefore always ...
marked by him.

652
01:23:21,606 --> 01:23:25,971
You must understand that my
have sacrificed life ...

653
01:23:26,015 --> 01:23:28,416
to avenge myself.

654
01:23:30,028 --> 01:23:33,617
I am closer than ever before.

655
01:23:34,393 --> 01:23:38,561
Rachel
I almost had him stuck in a corner ...

656
01:23:38,584 --> 01:23:40,024
with your father.

657
01:23:40,049 --> 01:23:41,609
Go to hell.

658
01:23:45,465 --> 01:23:48,640
You just might kill you
of your guilt free.

659
01:23:50,900 --> 01:23:52,232
Let's go!

660
01:24:04,245 --> 01:24:07,420
You can not just leave.

661
01:24:07,461 --> 01:24:09,129
Ishmael!

662
01:24:10,732 --> 01:24:13,634
No, no! Queequeg.

663
01:24:14,397 --> 01:24:17,987
Queequeg no, no.

664
01:24:29,831 --> 01:24:32,537
I'll kill you old man!

665
01:25:22,061 --> 01:25:22,857
Rachel.

666
01:25:51,054 --> 01:25:54,914
<i> I saw before my eyes to how the Demon
joined by his gods. </ i>

667
01:25:54,976 --> 01:25:56,886
<i> Rachel was again released from his captivity </ i>

668
01:25:57,102 --> 01:25:59,503
<i> from his retaliatory action. </ i>

<i> Only one man survived. </ i>

01:26:04,669 --> 01:26:07,865
<i> That's all I have to say. </ i>
