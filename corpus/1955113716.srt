1
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,900
Doctor!

2
00:01:09,602 --> 00:01:11,270
I need you in here!

3
00:01:20,213 --> 00:01:22,681
Doctor, I need you to see this.

4
00:01:22,683 --> 00:01:24,750
God dammit. What? What is it?

5
00:01:24,752 --> 00:01:28,120
There's been an incident.
I need your help.

6
00:01:28,122 --> 00:01:30,522
Get Mr. Warren.
He'll take care of it.

7
00:01:30,524 --> 00:01:32,057
But doctor...

8
00:01:32,059 --> 00:01:35,327
I'm in the middle
of a surgery, nurse.

9
00:01:35,329 --> 00:01:37,296
I'll get there as soon as I can.

10
00:01:37,298 --> 00:01:38,363
Yes, doctor.

11
00:01:43,236 --> 00:01:44,469
Where was I?

12
00:01:52,211 --> 00:01:54,613
That's him.

13
00:01:54,615 --> 00:01:56,415
<i>Come on.</i>

14
00:01:57,650 --> 00:01:58,817
<i>Come on!</i>

15
00:02:22,275 --> 00:02:24,743
Stop making things difficult.

16
00:02:30,616 --> 00:02:32,217
Let me go!

17
00:02:32,219 --> 00:02:33,117
Get me out of here!

18
00:02:33,119 --> 00:02:35,554
Let me go. Let me out of here.

19
00:02:36,622 --> 00:02:40,092
Scream all you want.

20
00:02:40,094 --> 00:02:42,861
No one can hear you.

21
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:48,800
Kids.

22
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:51,703
<i>Let me out of here!</i>

23
00:03:08,721 --> 00:03:10,589
<i>Zula.</i>

24
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:45,524
Are we there yet?

25
00:03:48,761 --> 00:03:50,629
Yeah, Megan, we're here.

26
00:03:56,569 --> 00:03:57,803
Smart ass.

27
00:05:49,348 --> 00:05:50,515
Where is everyone?

28
00:05:50,517 --> 00:05:52,784
Shouldn't they be here by now?

29
00:05:52,786 --> 00:05:54,586
As far as I know.

30
00:05:54,588 --> 00:05:55,520
<i>Megan?</i>

31
00:05:55,522 --> 00:05:57,522
Oh, look, there's Dale.

32
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:05,664
<i>Hey, Dale.</i>

33
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:20,211
Welcome to Tearlon.

34
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:21,479
Not bad.

35
00:06:21,481 --> 00:06:23,448
Yeah, they're still in the
process of remodeling,

36
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:25,450
but the whole
interior's brand new.

37
00:06:37,597 --> 00:06:40,198
- Hey, Megan.
- Hey.

38
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,666
You get a look around?

39
00:06:41,668 --> 00:06:44,436
Uh, no, still trying
to get to my room.

40
00:06:45,471 --> 00:06:47,772
It gets more beautiful
every time I come up here.

41
00:06:47,774 --> 00:06:49,441
If you'll excuse me, Rita,

42
00:06:49,443 --> 00:06:51,776
we should probably show
these two to their room.

43
00:06:57,316 --> 00:06:58,817
Our room?

44
00:06:58,819 --> 00:07:00,452
Yeah. Come on.

45
00:07:02,521 --> 00:07:03,388
Okay.

46
00:07:08,394 --> 00:07:09,694
Come on in.

47
00:07:15,468 --> 00:07:17,102
So everyone else called dibs.

48
00:07:17,104 --> 00:07:18,336
You two are the last ones here.

49
00:07:18,338 --> 00:07:19,638
So you're going
to have to share.

50
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:21,539
Hope there aren't
any objections.

51
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:23,341
Cute double beds.

52
00:07:23,343 --> 00:07:24,709
Yeah. Great.

53
00:07:25,745 --> 00:07:27,345
So?

54
00:07:27,347 --> 00:07:29,247
I'm okay with it if you are.

55
00:07:29,249 --> 00:07:30,548
It works for me.

56
00:07:32,451 --> 00:07:36,655
Well, you two are
the only ones not to complain.

57
00:07:36,657 --> 00:07:38,490
It seems our little group
has a talent

58
00:07:38,492 --> 00:07:40,659
for finding flaws
in a free trip.

59
00:07:40,661 --> 00:07:41,559
Don't worry, Dale.

60
00:07:41,561 --> 00:07:43,628
I'm sure we'll
think of something.

61
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:44,829
All right.

62
00:07:44,831 --> 00:07:46,831
I'll be downstairs
if you need anything.

63
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:48,366
- Thanks, Dale.
- Sure.

64
00:07:51,337 --> 00:07:53,104
<i>Wow.</i>

65
00:07:53,106 --> 00:07:54,673
Look at that view.

66
00:08:39,452 --> 00:08:40,752
Oh, shit.

67
00:08:57,403 --> 00:08:59,471
- Hey!
- - Jesus, Tedi.

68
00:08:59,473 --> 00:09:00,905
Jesus? Where?

69
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:03,608
- Did you see him?
- - See who?

70
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:05,443
- The kid.
- - What kid?

71
00:09:05,445 --> 00:09:06,878
The little kid.

72
00:09:07,446 --> 00:09:08,880
What? I didn't see any kid.

73
00:09:09,615 --> 00:09:11,116
I saw Joel.

74
00:09:11,417 --> 00:09:12,784
Who the fuck is Joel?

75
00:09:12,786 --> 00:09:14,786
Joel is lira's special
delivery from her

76
00:09:14,788 --> 00:09:16,221
douche of the month club.

77
00:09:16,223 --> 00:09:17,522
Wait, what?

78
00:09:17,524 --> 00:09:19,457
Lira brought some guy.

79
00:09:19,459 --> 00:09:20,825
She brought her boyfriend?

80
00:09:20,827 --> 00:09:23,261
Yeah, if you want
to call him that.

81
00:09:23,263 --> 00:09:26,064
But I thought this trip
was just for our department.

82
00:09:26,066 --> 00:09:28,800
Yeah, I thought so too, but I
guess she found a loophole.

83
00:09:28,802 --> 00:09:30,668
Which was?

84
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:32,570
She just showed up with him.

85
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:34,139
And if I'd known
you could do that,

86
00:09:34,141 --> 00:09:36,508
I would have brought myself a
little something to poke on.

87
00:09:37,810 --> 00:09:39,177
Tedi.

88
00:09:39,179 --> 00:09:40,445
Come on. It could happen.

89
00:09:40,447 --> 00:09:42,447
Fyi, you've got to share
a wall with them,

90
00:09:42,449 --> 00:09:43,815
so I hope you weren't planning

91
00:09:43,817 --> 00:09:45,283
on getting any sleep
this weekend.

92
00:09:45,285 --> 00:09:46,518
Are you kidding me?

93
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:47,418
No.

94
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:49,320
Oh, what's this is
I hear about you

95
00:09:49,322 --> 00:09:51,256
and, uh, forest sharing a room?

96
00:09:51,258 --> 00:09:52,457
It's no big deal.

97
00:09:52,459 --> 00:09:54,659
It's not like we're in
the same bed or anything.

98
00:09:54,661 --> 00:09:56,661
Yeah, not with that
attitude you're not.

99
00:09:56,663 --> 00:09:58,463
We're just friends.

100
00:09:58,465 --> 00:10:01,666
Oh, so then it's cool if
we switch rooms, right?

101
00:10:01,668 --> 00:10:03,902
You touch her and I'll kill you.

102
00:10:05,471 --> 00:10:06,471
Don't move.

103
00:10:06,473 --> 00:10:08,740
She can't see us
if we don't move.

104
00:10:11,644 --> 00:10:13,111
Hey, Zac.

105
00:10:14,413 --> 00:10:15,547
What's up, fellas?

106
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:19,884
What was that all about?

107
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:22,253
Shut up, Tedi.

108
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:28,526
Zac, I'll see you at dinner.

109
00:11:00,659 --> 00:11:02,060
Who was that?

110
00:11:02,062 --> 00:11:03,461
No one.

111
00:11:03,463 --> 00:11:04,729
I can't get a signal.

112
00:11:05,464 --> 00:11:07,465
You know the first
rule of vacationing.

113
00:11:07,467 --> 00:11:09,367
Leave everything behind.

114
00:11:09,369 --> 00:11:10,768
I know.

115
00:11:11,237 --> 00:11:13,538
But this isn't a vacation, Zac.

116
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:15,173
It's a retreat.

117
00:11:15,175 --> 00:11:16,541
All right, smart ass.

118
00:11:17,443 --> 00:11:21,446
Attention please..

119
00:11:21,448 --> 00:11:22,280
See?

120
00:11:22,282 --> 00:11:23,681
Back to work.

121
00:11:26,452 --> 00:11:27,652
Could I get everyone's attention

122
00:11:27,654 --> 00:11:29,354
down in the living room, please?

123
00:11:34,426 --> 00:11:35,894
You guys seen Tedi?

124
00:11:37,264 --> 00:11:38,463
He's in the bathroom.

125
00:11:38,465 --> 00:11:40,164
Probably beating off.

126
00:11:40,499 --> 00:11:41,299
Nope.

127
00:11:41,301 --> 00:11:43,368
I tugged one out before we left.

128
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:44,435
I am good.

129
00:11:44,437 --> 00:11:45,670
All right.

130
00:11:45,672 --> 00:11:47,472
Looks like everyone's here.

131
00:11:47,474 --> 00:11:48,706
I just wanted to
let you guys know

132
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:50,408
you need to be
extra careful, okay?

133
00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:52,410
Especially if you wander
out in the woods at night.

134
00:11:52,412 --> 00:11:53,645
The caretaker said
there's a lot of bears

135
00:11:53,647 --> 00:11:54,812
around this time of year.

136
00:11:54,814 --> 00:11:56,614
Wouldn't look really good
on my review if one of you

137
00:11:56,616 --> 00:11:59,250
come back dead or with a
huge bite out of your ass.

138
00:11:59,252 --> 00:12:00,685
Don't even think about it.

139
00:12:00,687 --> 00:12:01,653
All right?

140
00:12:01,655 --> 00:12:03,454
Tonight's fair game, guys. Okay.

141
00:12:03,456 --> 00:12:06,424
Have fun, whatever, but let's
not forget why we're up here.

142
00:12:06,426 --> 00:12:08,126
We have our first
meeting tomorrow.

143
00:12:08,128 --> 00:12:10,161
Yeah, why are we here?

144
00:12:10,629 --> 00:12:11,828
Ah, good question.

145
00:12:11,830 --> 00:12:15,266
Uh, we're up here because it's
a simultaneous pat on the back

146
00:12:15,268 --> 00:12:17,502
and kick in the
pants, to be honest.

147
00:12:17,504 --> 00:12:19,504
The head honchos love
what we're doing, okay?

148
00:12:19,506 --> 00:12:20,705
That's why we're here.

149
00:12:20,707 --> 00:12:22,440
But they're worried that
our shareholders

150
00:12:22,442 --> 00:12:24,242
are going to get a little
bit antsy and jump ship

151
00:12:24,244 --> 00:12:26,411
if our little growth
stock doesn't somehow

152
00:12:26,413 --> 00:12:28,179
exceed next quarter's forecast.

153
00:12:28,614 --> 00:12:29,514
Rita?

154
00:12:30,616 --> 00:12:33,051
We'd like to start by
getting everyone together

155
00:12:33,053 --> 00:12:35,153
to help inspire team unity.

156
00:12:38,223 --> 00:12:39,490
Oh, and they want
to pick our brains

157
00:12:39,492 --> 00:12:42,226
to see if we can figure out
ways to increase productivity.

158
00:12:42,228 --> 00:12:44,662
Of course, with the same
amount of resources,

159
00:12:44,664 --> 00:12:45,763
which is always nice.

160
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:48,099
It's only a couple
of meetings, people, okay?

161
00:12:48,101 --> 00:12:49,467
You pretty much have
the rest of the weekend

162
00:12:49,469 --> 00:12:50,468
to do whatever you want.

163
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:52,270
Like get eaten by bears?

164
00:12:52,272 --> 00:12:53,271
Rawr.

165
00:12:54,074 --> 00:12:55,640
Fine, if it makes you happy.

166
00:12:55,642 --> 00:12:56,140
Okay?

167
00:12:56,142 --> 00:12:58,643
If there aren't any
other smart Aleck remarks,

168
00:12:58,645 --> 00:13:00,712
does anyone have any
questions or comments?

169
00:13:00,714 --> 00:13:01,546
Yeah.

170
00:13:02,047 --> 00:13:03,748
What if we see a ghost?

171
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:07,385
Meigan, ghosts aren't real.

172
00:13:07,387 --> 00:13:08,319
Thank you.

173
00:13:08,321 --> 00:13:09,754
Uh, what about the holy ghost?

174
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:12,557
That's not the same thing.

175
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:15,760
But you believe in Jesus, right?

176
00:13:16,662 --> 00:13:17,762
Of course.

177
00:13:17,764 --> 00:13:21,099
Well, isn't that kind of
like believing in Santa Claus,

178
00:13:21,101 --> 00:13:22,767
but not the Easter bunny?

179
00:13:24,436 --> 00:13:27,338
Tedi, you don't
believe in Christ?

180
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:32,310
Um, no, but I do believe
in the antichrist.

181
00:13:35,414 --> 00:13:36,581
How come?

182
00:13:37,649 --> 00:13:39,484
Because she works in marketing.

183
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:41,452
Okay.

184
00:13:41,454 --> 00:13:42,653
Knock it off. Knock it off.

185
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:44,255
Let's not start a holy war.

186
00:13:44,257 --> 00:13:45,757
See what you started?

187
00:13:46,258 --> 00:13:48,259
At some point during the
weekend I expect

188
00:13:48,261 --> 00:13:50,661
each of to thank Rita,
for talking to Penny Pinchers

189
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:52,830
into even letting
us come up here.

190
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:54,499
Thank you so much, Rita.

191
00:13:54,501 --> 00:13:55,767
Thank you, Rita.

192
00:13:56,235 --> 00:13:57,468
Yeah, thanks, Rita.

193
00:13:57,470 --> 00:13:58,536
You're the best.

194
00:13:59,838 --> 00:14:02,540
Meigan, if I could
offer a piece of advice?

195
00:14:03,442 --> 00:14:04,308
Shoot.

196
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:05,676
Don't worry about dead.

197
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:08,513
Fear the living,
especially with this group.

198
00:14:08,814 --> 00:14:10,448
All righty.

199
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:11,749
I'll bear that in mind.

200
00:14:14,253 --> 00:14:16,354
Hey, Dale, can I
talk to you for a sec?

201
00:14:17,823 --> 00:14:19,157
Sure, Zach. What's up?

202
00:14:20,426 --> 00:14:22,260
Who was that old man with Rita?

203
00:14:22,262 --> 00:14:23,728
That was Earl ray,
the caretaker.

204
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:25,496
He greeted us when we got here.

205
00:14:25,498 --> 00:14:27,265
Is he staying here?

206
00:14:27,267 --> 00:14:29,534
No, he said he has a
cabin nearby somewhere.

207
00:14:30,469 --> 00:14:31,469
Really?

208
00:14:31,471 --> 00:14:32,470
Yeah.

209
00:14:32,472 --> 00:14:34,338
Only living soul
around for miles.

210
00:14:36,608 --> 00:14:38,242
Okay, thanks.

211
00:14:38,244 --> 00:14:39,043
No problem.

212
00:14:39,045 --> 00:14:40,478
Good meeting.

213
00:14:47,453 --> 00:14:48,786
Ugh.

214
00:14:49,254 --> 00:14:50,721
Nature sucks.

215
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:52,090
Oh, come on.

216
00:14:52,092 --> 00:14:53,558
I kind of like it here.

217
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:57,728
I'm probably going to get,
like, a million mosquito bites.

218
00:14:58,097 --> 00:14:59,330
Can you blame them?

219
00:15:03,669 --> 00:15:06,537
What the hell are we going to do
up here for three days?

220
00:15:07,072 --> 00:15:10,741
Well, there's a hot
tub on the porch.

221
00:15:12,077 --> 00:15:14,445
Um, you trying to
get me into a bikini?

222
00:15:14,447 --> 00:15:15,313
No,

223
00:15:16,648 --> 00:15:18,549
trying to get you out of one.

224
00:15:19,651 --> 00:15:23,121
The blue one or the black?

225
00:15:26,492 --> 00:15:28,259
Hmm, I don't know.

226
00:15:28,261 --> 00:15:29,760
I'm going to have
to see them on.

227
00:15:31,663 --> 00:15:32,530
Alright.

228
00:16:17,442 --> 00:16:18,509
Well?

229
00:16:21,547 --> 00:16:22,747
I don't know. Turn around.

230
00:16:25,117 --> 00:16:27,251
It's kind of revealing,
don't you think?

231
00:16:27,253 --> 00:16:28,753
That's the point.

232
00:16:29,154 --> 00:16:30,721
Don't worry I have a wrap

233
00:16:31,256 --> 00:16:33,558
to keep Tedi from
checking out my ass.

234
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:36,494
Let me see the other one.

235
00:16:36,496 --> 00:16:38,095
Are you serious?

236
00:16:38,097 --> 00:16:39,730
Yeah, I'm dead serious.

237
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:42,733
Fine.

238
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,373
Happy?

239
00:17:24,276 --> 00:17:25,543
And then some.

240
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:36,821
Mm, what do you
think you're doing?

241
00:17:36,823 --> 00:17:38,823
You wanted to go in the hot tub.

242
00:17:38,825 --> 00:17:40,458
Changed my mind.

243
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:41,392
Too bad.

244
00:17:41,394 --> 00:17:42,460
I'm ready.

245
00:17:42,462 --> 00:17:44,362
Put your fucking suit on.

246
00:17:45,063 --> 00:17:46,364
All right, already.

247
00:17:59,411 --> 00:18:02,146
See you later.

248
00:18:20,832 --> 00:18:21,699
Oh.

249
00:18:22,835 --> 00:18:23,768
What's up, player?

250
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:25,336
Good morning.

251
00:18:26,071 --> 00:18:28,372
I thought iTunes was
against your religion.

252
00:18:29,074 --> 00:18:30,141
No.

253
00:18:30,442 --> 00:18:31,909
The lord loves music.

254
00:18:31,911 --> 00:18:32,643
Oh.

255
00:18:32,645 --> 00:18:33,811
So what do you got on that?

256
00:18:33,813 --> 00:18:35,546
Like, motorhead or?

257
00:18:36,648 --> 00:18:38,215
Book of psalms.

258
00:18:39,251 --> 00:18:40,217
Oh, seriously?

259
00:18:40,219 --> 00:18:41,752
Um-hum.

260
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:45,356
I find it very inspiring
when I go for a nature hike.

261
00:18:47,259 --> 00:18:48,459
All right then.

262
00:18:48,461 --> 00:18:49,493
Carry on.

263
00:18:49,495 --> 00:18:51,262
Peace be with you, Tedi.

264
00:18:51,264 --> 00:18:52,563
You too, kiddo.

265
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:02,740
What's up, dude?

266
00:19:03,241 --> 00:19:04,342
Morning.

267
00:19:04,643 --> 00:19:07,345
Looks like someone got
some ass last night.

268
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:10,047
That's kind of a personal
matter, don't you think?

269
00:19:10,049 --> 00:19:11,582
Not if you have ears, it's not.

270
00:19:13,685 --> 00:19:17,288
Hey, you ever play that
game ass, Cooter, mouth?

271
00:19:17,290 --> 00:19:19,490
Ass, Cooter, mouth, uh, no.

272
00:19:19,492 --> 00:19:21,459
I can't say that I have.
How do you play?

273
00:19:21,461 --> 00:19:24,061
Well, you give me a
number one through three,

274
00:19:24,063 --> 00:19:27,131
and I try and guess which hole
you stuck it in last night.

275
00:19:28,066 --> 00:19:29,767
What if I say all three?

276
00:19:30,635 --> 00:19:32,370
What if I say high five?

277
00:19:33,238 --> 00:19:34,338
Smack.

278
00:19:35,073 --> 00:19:37,041
Not necessarily in
that order though.

279
00:19:37,043 --> 00:19:38,542
You're all right, man.

280
00:19:39,211 --> 00:19:40,644
You're a fucking douchebag.

281
00:19:40,646 --> 00:19:41,712
Heard that.

282
00:19:42,247 --> 00:19:43,547
Good morning, lira.

283
00:19:44,449 --> 00:19:46,550
I said, good morning, lira.

284
00:19:47,452 --> 00:19:49,120
Good morning, Tedi.

285
00:19:49,454 --> 00:19:51,889
Hey, you know that expression,
'that girl's got spunk'?

286
00:19:53,225 --> 00:19:54,358
Yeah.

287
00:19:54,659 --> 00:19:56,160
Well, when they say it about you

288
00:19:56,162 --> 00:19:57,762
I think they mean
it quite literally.

289
00:20:01,666 --> 00:20:03,367
It's called toothpaste, dipshit.

290
00:20:03,369 --> 00:20:04,502
You should try it.

291
00:20:04,504 --> 00:20:05,669
Yeah, I will.

292
00:20:05,671 --> 00:20:07,271
I do that after
I have my coffee.

293
00:20:07,273 --> 00:20:10,307
That way I get that clean
mouth feeling all day.

294
00:20:11,209 --> 00:20:13,310
Do you know where they
keep the toothpicks?

295
00:20:13,445 --> 00:20:14,245
Yeah.

296
00:20:14,247 --> 00:20:16,514
Joel's got one between his legs.

297
00:20:17,015 --> 00:20:17,681
Right?

298
00:20:17,683 --> 00:20:18,649
Hey, buddy.

299
00:20:18,651 --> 00:20:20,050
Can I kill him, Dale,

300
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:20,450
please?

301
00:20:20,452 --> 00:20:22,887
Not unless you find
me a new programmer.

302
00:20:23,488 --> 00:20:25,790
Tedi's kind of like that
fat guy in Jurassic park.

303
00:20:25,792 --> 00:20:27,758
We loose him and all
hell breaks loose.

304
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:28,659
Yeah.

305
00:20:28,661 --> 00:20:31,395
If it wasn't for me, you'd
be up to your dick sucker

306
00:20:31,397 --> 00:20:32,530
in dinosaurs.

307
00:20:34,433 --> 00:20:36,267
Let me know if you
change your mind.

308
00:20:36,468 --> 00:20:37,468
I'm making omelets.

309
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:38,569
Who wants one?

310
00:20:38,837 --> 00:20:40,171
No thanks.

311
00:20:40,472 --> 00:20:42,139
Oh, god, Dale. No.

312
00:20:43,208 --> 00:20:44,642
What's wrong with my omelets.

313
00:20:44,644 --> 00:20:45,843
They're made with love.

314
00:20:49,047 --> 00:20:49,780
Whoa.

315
00:20:51,049 --> 00:20:52,283
What happened to you?

316
00:20:58,190 --> 00:20:59,123
What?

317
00:21:01,426 --> 00:21:02,293
What?

318
00:21:05,765 --> 00:21:08,232
Psalm 23,
the lord is my Shepherd,

319
00:21:08,234 --> 00:21:09,333
<i>I shall not want.</i>

320
00:21:10,635 --> 00:21:13,537
He makes me to lie
down in green pastures.

321
00:21:13,805 --> 00:21:16,340
He leads me beside
the still waters.

322
00:21:17,042 --> 00:21:19,143
<i>He restoreth my soul.</i>

323
00:21:19,811 --> 00:21:23,714
He leads me in paths of
righteousness for his namesake.

324
00:21:25,050 --> 00:21:28,252
Yea, though I walk through the
valley of the shadow of death,

325
00:21:28,254 --> 00:21:31,889
I will fear no evil,
for thou art with me.

326
00:21:33,058 --> 00:21:36,126
Thy rod and thy staff,
they comfort me.

327
00:21:37,262 --> 00:21:41,265
Thou preparest a table for me in
the presence of mine enemies.

328
00:21:41,267 --> 00:21:43,367
Thou anointest my head with oil.

329
00:21:44,102 --> 00:21:45,569
<i>My cup runeth over.</i>

330
00:21:46,471 --> 00:21:48,706
Surely goodness and
mercy shall follow

331
00:21:48,708 --> 00:21:50,541
<i>me all the days of my life.</i>

332
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:55,145
And I shall dwell in the
house of the lord forever.

333
00:22:03,288 --> 00:22:05,155
All right. Who's missing?

334
00:22:06,258 --> 00:22:07,324
Not me.

335
00:22:07,659 --> 00:22:08,759
Anybody seen Rita?

336
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:09,693
Uh, yeah.

337
00:22:09,695 --> 00:22:11,262
She went for a jog this morning.

338
00:22:11,264 --> 00:22:13,097
Did she say where she was going?

339
00:22:13,099 --> 00:22:14,097
Fuck if I know.

340
00:22:14,099 --> 00:22:16,267
She probably went to
find Jesus or something.

341
00:22:16,269 --> 00:22:17,768
Should we wait for her?

342
00:22:18,021 --> 00:22:18,470
Uh, no.

343
00:22:18,471 --> 00:22:20,437
We've covered most
of this already.

344
00:22:20,439 --> 00:22:21,739
I'll just fill her in
when she gets back.

345
00:22:21,741 --> 00:22:22,139
Yeah.

346
00:22:22,141 --> 00:22:24,542
Let's get this
party started, huh?

347
00:22:25,043 --> 00:22:26,744
Let's get down to business.

348
00:22:27,245 --> 00:22:29,213
I'd like to start off
by saying thank you

349
00:22:29,215 --> 00:22:31,248
to all of you for the
past quarter's extra work.

350
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:33,083
I really appreciate
all your effort.

351
00:22:33,085 --> 00:22:34,285
You're welcome.

352
00:22:34,287 --> 00:22:34,585
Okay.

353
00:22:34,587 --> 00:22:36,654
My design team, you're
going to be happy to know,

354
00:22:36,656 --> 00:22:38,556
your prayers are
finally being answered.

355
00:22:38,823 --> 00:22:40,491
You're transferring Tedi?

356
00:22:41,661 --> 00:22:45,496
Oh, forest, you break my heart.

357
00:22:45,498 --> 00:22:50,534
Oh, we still love you,
Tedi, just from far away.

358
00:22:51,269 --> 00:22:53,170
Like a fine work of art.

359
00:22:53,838 --> 00:22:56,173
Yeah, something like that.

360
00:22:57,409 --> 00:23:00,277
I'm upgrading your
workstations with the new Imacs.

361
00:23:00,279 --> 00:23:02,780
Retina display, flash
drives, the whole deal.

362
00:23:02,782 --> 00:23:04,381
Yes.

363
00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:06,050
I thought you'd like that.

364
00:23:06,052 --> 00:23:07,050
What about storage?

365
00:23:07,052 --> 00:23:09,687
Um, I'll have to look
into it, but storage is cheap.

366
00:23:09,689 --> 00:23:11,755
It shouldn't be a problem
getting it authorized.

367
00:23:12,223 --> 00:23:14,458
Hey, uh, what about
loosening up Websense?

368
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:16,660
I mean, it's not like I
can't hack through that shit

369
00:23:16,662 --> 00:23:17,695
if I wanted to.

370
00:23:17,697 --> 00:23:18,796
You know I could.

371
00:23:18,798 --> 00:23:20,831
I just... why waste
my time, you know?

372
00:23:20,833 --> 00:23:22,833
You only want them
to take down Websense,

373
00:23:22,835 --> 00:23:24,368
so you can look at porn.

374
00:23:24,469 --> 00:23:27,471
Whoa, it is not my fault the
server crashes every time

375
00:23:27,473 --> 00:23:29,740
I try and download
your sex tape.

376
00:23:30,241 --> 00:23:31,542
You're going to die.

377
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:34,144
Lira.

378
00:23:37,248 --> 00:23:41,352
Children, could you
come back to the table?

379
00:23:57,669 --> 00:24:02,272
All of a sudden came the thunder
of hooves rushing up the path.

380
00:24:03,643 --> 00:24:05,476
A dark figure in a black cloak

381
00:24:05,478 --> 00:24:07,745
rode it's horse
toward the porch.

382
00:24:08,446 --> 00:24:11,382
The old man walked
down the front stairs.

383
00:24:11,516 --> 00:24:14,051
And the cloaked figure stopped
his horse just outside

384
00:24:14,053 --> 00:24:16,086
the pool of light
that was being cast

385
00:24:16,088 --> 00:24:18,489
by the lanterns
hung above the porch.

386
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:23,460
The old man staggered back.

387
00:24:23,462 --> 00:24:27,331
Shot twice, once in the neck
and the other in his chest.

388
00:24:29,434 --> 00:24:31,535
The dark figure rose
up onto his horse

389
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:34,538
and fled down the Lane
disappearing into the night.

390
00:24:35,674 --> 00:24:37,608
Friends rushed to
the old man's aid,

391
00:24:37,610 --> 00:24:39,877
but it was already too late.

392
00:24:41,646 --> 00:24:44,415
The first shot had bored
a quarter sized hole.

393
00:24:44,417 --> 00:24:45,449
Now's your chance.

394
00:24:45,451 --> 00:24:46,417
To a chamber...

395
00:24:46,419 --> 00:24:48,085
What the hell are
you talking about?

396
00:24:48,087 --> 00:24:50,754
Chicks get super turned
on when they're scared.

397
00:24:51,823 --> 00:24:53,257
Like you would know.

398
00:24:53,259 --> 00:24:53,757
Trust me.

399
00:24:53,759 --> 00:24:58,162
Both times I scored the chick
was either drunk or scared.

400
00:24:58,430 --> 00:25:00,364
I think one of the
times she was both.

401
00:25:04,469 --> 00:25:05,636
Alright.

402
00:25:05,638 --> 00:25:07,137
Hey, hey, Zac?

403
00:25:07,139 --> 00:25:08,706
Just in case.

404
00:25:09,274 --> 00:25:10,474
Thanks, Tedi.

405
00:25:10,476 --> 00:25:11,642
Do you guys mind?

406
00:25:11,644 --> 00:25:12,142
No.

407
00:25:12,144 --> 00:25:14,812
Sorry. It was just getting
really good, Dale.

408
00:25:14,814 --> 00:25:16,547
Please continue.

409
00:25:17,048 --> 00:25:17,781
Thanks.

410
00:25:17,783 --> 00:25:22,653
Now as I was saying,
so much blood

411
00:25:22,655 --> 00:25:26,457
poured from the old man's
wounds that a thick pool

412
00:25:26,459 --> 00:25:28,358
formed underneath his head.

413
00:25:29,627 --> 00:25:30,694
He coughed once.

414
00:25:32,664 --> 00:25:33,797
And then again,

415
00:25:33,799 --> 00:25:37,101
the second being
a hideous gurgling

416
00:25:37,103 --> 00:25:39,470
sound as though
two invisible hands

417
00:25:39,472 --> 00:25:42,740
were choking the old
man to death,

418
00:25:43,441 --> 00:25:45,876
squeezing the very
life out of him.

419
00:25:47,245 --> 00:25:49,613
The sound sent a shiver
up the spines of everyone

420
00:25:49,615 --> 00:25:55,285
who heard the old man's
last dying breath.

421
00:26:05,096 --> 00:26:06,130
Hey.

422
00:26:06,664 --> 00:26:08,499
Dale's ghost story
getting to you?

423
00:26:08,501 --> 00:26:08,899
Oh yeah.

424
00:26:08,901 --> 00:26:11,468
I'm going to have
nightmares for weeks.

425
00:26:11,470 --> 00:26:12,469
Here.

426
00:26:12,471 --> 00:26:13,737
I brought you some Pinot.

427
00:26:14,439 --> 00:26:16,440
Trying to get me liquored up?

428
00:26:16,442 --> 00:26:17,474
Maybe.

429
00:26:17,476 --> 00:26:18,742
Is it working?

430
00:26:19,611 --> 00:26:20,744
Maybe.

431
00:26:21,446 --> 00:26:22,646
This is really good.

432
00:26:22,648 --> 00:26:24,548
Compliments of Mr. sau.

433
00:26:25,049 --> 00:26:28,285
You know, I was a little
taken back by him joining us

434
00:26:28,287 --> 00:26:29,887
on our little retreat
here, but, um,

435
00:26:30,421 --> 00:26:32,556
now I'm starting to think it
might have its benefits.

436
00:26:33,258 --> 00:26:36,760
Having a rich boyfriend
does have its advantages.

437
00:26:37,662 --> 00:26:38,595
Are you sure?

438
00:26:40,665 --> 00:26:42,332
I wouldn't know.

439
00:26:42,667 --> 00:26:45,536
I'm a 'two buck
Chuck' type of girl.

440
00:26:50,475 --> 00:26:51,742
You okay?

441
00:26:52,410 --> 00:26:53,644
Yeah.

442
00:26:53,646 --> 00:26:54,745
I'm all right.

443
00:26:56,447 --> 00:26:57,247
No.

444
00:26:57,249 --> 00:26:58,549
There's something wrong.

445
00:26:59,050 --> 00:27:00,484
I see it in your eyes.

446
00:27:00,486 --> 00:27:01,351
Oh.

447
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:03,821
You can read my
eyes now, can you?

448
00:27:03,823 --> 00:27:04,558
Yeah. I can.

449
00:27:05,456 --> 00:27:07,758
I bet you can't even tell
me what color they are.

450
00:27:09,828 --> 00:27:10,328
Well?

451
00:27:19,839 --> 00:27:21,471
<i>They are brown.</i>

452
00:27:21,473 --> 00:27:23,106
I know. I'm just
messing with you.

453
00:27:23,108 --> 00:27:25,442
And you stole that
from AXL rose.

454
00:27:25,444 --> 00:27:27,177
How do you know he
didn't steal that from me?

455
00:27:27,179 --> 00:27:28,712
Because you're
not that sensitive.

456
00:27:28,714 --> 00:27:30,214
I am sensitive, dammit.

457
00:27:30,216 --> 00:27:32,216
As if AXL rose is
Mr. sensitivity.

458
00:27:32,218 --> 00:27:35,419
Hey, I'm sure he's a nice
guy once you get to know him.

459
00:27:35,421 --> 00:27:37,120
That's like saying
he's an asshole,

460
00:27:37,122 --> 00:27:38,455
but you'll get to used to it.

461
00:27:38,457 --> 00:27:38,955
No it's not.

462
00:27:38,957 --> 00:27:41,458
He once threw a girl
down a flight of stairs.

463
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:44,828
Well, I'm sure he
had good reason to.

464
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:46,330
Yeah, he did.

465
00:27:47,232 --> 00:27:49,233
Because she wouldn't
sleep with him.

466
00:27:49,235 --> 00:27:50,267
That will do it.

467
00:27:51,103 --> 00:27:52,469
That is not funny.

468
00:27:52,471 --> 00:27:53,437
That is...

469
00:27:53,439 --> 00:27:55,072
Why, why are you laughing?

470
00:27:55,074 --> 00:27:56,807
I am not laughing.

471
00:27:56,809 --> 00:27:58,141
I see that.

472
00:27:58,443 --> 00:28:00,110
Damn you, Zac.

473
00:28:00,645 --> 00:28:03,046
Why do you always have
this messed up way

474
00:28:03,048 --> 00:28:04,715
of making me feel better?

475
00:28:05,416 --> 00:28:07,150
I don't know how you do it.

476
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:11,154
Are you going to tell me
what's wrong?

477
00:28:12,056 --> 00:28:14,892
Rita's not back yet.

478
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:16,894
Are you sure?

479
00:28:16,896 --> 00:28:21,331
I thought she was just avoiding
Dale's tale of the occult in there.

480
00:28:21,633 --> 00:28:23,300
I'm pretty sure, Zac.

481
00:28:23,302 --> 00:28:25,135
She's been gone all day.

482
00:28:26,437 --> 00:28:28,105
Have you told Dale?

483
00:28:28,107 --> 00:28:29,172
No.

484
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:31,541
I didn't want to spoil his fun.

485
00:28:31,743 --> 00:28:33,510
A whole hell of a lot of fun.

486
00:28:36,214 --> 00:28:37,748
Should we go back in?

487
00:28:38,583 --> 00:28:39,750
If we have to.

488
00:28:46,724 --> 00:28:49,726
From that day on the servants
couldn't keep the porch clean.

489
00:28:51,262 --> 00:28:53,463
Every few weeks a
damp pool of blood

490
00:28:53,465 --> 00:28:57,734
would appear in the same spot
where the old man had died.

491
00:28:58,670 --> 00:29:00,671
They tried repainting
the porch several times,

492
00:29:00,673 --> 00:29:04,107
but the blood stain would
always bleed through.

493
00:29:05,643 --> 00:29:07,778
One night one of the
servants saw something

494
00:29:07,780 --> 00:29:09,279
that caused him to go mad.

495
00:29:11,449 --> 00:29:14,451
Folks said that the
house was haunted

496
00:29:14,453 --> 00:29:16,753
by the angry spirit
of the old man.

497
00:29:17,455 --> 00:29:19,222
The house was sold
several times,

498
00:29:19,224 --> 00:29:21,525
but each time the
residents were driven out

499
00:29:22,427 --> 00:29:26,697
by the horrible gasping
breaths of the old man's ghost

500
00:29:26,699 --> 00:29:29,766
and the hideous blood stain
that could never be removed.

501
00:29:30,468 --> 00:29:35,539
The house was eventually
abandoned until just last year.

502
00:29:36,641 --> 00:29:38,542
One year ago today, in fact.

503
00:29:39,043 --> 00:29:45,349
When it was completely remodeled
and turned into Tearlon lodge.

504
00:29:48,087 --> 00:29:49,753
You're so full of it, Dale.

505
00:29:50,254 --> 00:29:51,688
I had you going.

506
00:29:51,690 --> 00:29:53,824
I don't know. I thought
the story was pretty good.

507
00:29:53,826 --> 00:29:57,694
Up until the end because I
think I heard that one before.

508
00:29:57,696 --> 00:29:58,895
Yeah?

509
00:29:59,464 --> 00:30:01,398
Good one, d, although I think

510
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:03,266
you've got to give
partial credit to Joel.

511
00:30:03,268 --> 00:30:04,835
The wine definitely helped.

512
00:30:04,837 --> 00:30:06,536
Yeah, it's something else.

513
00:30:07,472 --> 00:30:08,472
You have any more?

514
00:30:08,474 --> 00:30:08,872
Yeah.

515
00:30:08,874 --> 00:30:11,274
I got a whole case of it.
I'll go get you some some more.

516
00:30:11,276 --> 00:30:12,709
Let him get it himself.

517
00:30:13,077 --> 00:30:14,511
Don't be a bitch, babe.

518
00:30:15,446 --> 00:30:16,747
Excuse me?

519
00:30:17,215 --> 00:30:19,649
He said don't be a bitch, bitch.

520
00:30:21,453 --> 00:30:23,220
Did you want any more?

521
00:30:23,222 --> 00:30:24,354
- Sure.
- Okay.

522
00:30:30,461 --> 00:30:31,328
Dale?

523
00:30:32,263 --> 00:30:33,163
Hey.

524
00:30:33,264 --> 00:30:34,831
You missed my finale.

525
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:36,833
I'm sure you didn't disappoint.

526
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:38,668
Yeah, but every
great storyteller

527
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:41,805
saves his best for last.

528
00:30:41,807 --> 00:30:44,274
I'm worried about Rita.

529
00:30:44,276 --> 00:30:47,277
She hasn't come back yet
and she's been gone all day.

530
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:48,378
Did you try her cell?

531
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:50,313
No, I can't get a signal.

532
00:30:50,315 --> 00:30:51,715
Yeah, me either.

533
00:30:51,717 --> 00:30:53,250
Has anybody seen Rita?

534
00:30:53,252 --> 00:30:54,317
Yeah, I did.

535
00:30:54,319 --> 00:30:56,253
She got eaten by a bear.

536
00:30:56,255 --> 00:30:56,653
Tedi.

537
00:30:56,655 --> 00:30:59,189
Can you be serious
for one fucking minute?

538
00:30:59,191 --> 00:31:00,424
No.

539
00:31:01,193 --> 00:31:03,160
Which one's Rita again?

540
00:31:03,162 --> 00:31:07,431
She's a dark hair, skinny
chick, huge bug in her ass.

541
00:31:07,433 --> 00:31:08,298
Oh, yeah.

542
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:09,666
I remember her.

543
00:31:09,668 --> 00:31:11,668
Yo, money bags, pass the hammer.

544
00:31:11,670 --> 00:31:13,437
Thank you.

545
00:31:13,439 --> 00:31:15,639
I really think we
should look for her.

546
00:31:15,641 --> 00:31:16,706
Wait a second.

547
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:18,175
She comes up here all the time.

548
00:31:18,177 --> 00:31:20,243
She might have just gone to
visit with the caretaker.

549
00:31:20,245 --> 00:31:22,813
Well, is there any
way we can contact him?

550
00:31:22,815 --> 00:31:24,381
I don't think he
even has a phone.

551
00:31:24,383 --> 00:31:26,783
I kind of get the impression he
prefers to live off the grid.

552
00:31:27,485 --> 00:31:29,019
Well, what if Zac and
I go and look for her?

553
00:31:29,021 --> 00:31:29,419
No.

554
00:31:29,421 --> 00:31:32,622
I can't have you two traipsing
off in the middle of the night.

555
00:31:32,624 --> 00:31:34,458
You could get lost, or
fall in a bear trap,

556
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:37,294
or god knows what else.

557
00:31:37,296 --> 00:31:39,529
If she's not back by the
morning we'll go look for her.

558
00:31:39,531 --> 00:31:41,298
- Okay?
- Alright.

559
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:43,667
That goes for everybody.

560
00:31:43,669 --> 00:31:45,335
Even Joel?

561
00:31:45,337 --> 00:31:49,072
Yes, even Joel.

562
00:31:49,074 --> 00:31:51,208
With that, I'm going to
get some sleep.

563
00:31:51,210 --> 00:31:53,376
This wine's done a number on me.

564
00:31:53,378 --> 00:31:55,412
I need to hit the hay.

565
00:31:55,414 --> 00:31:57,814
Try to keep it down
to a dull roar.

566
00:31:57,816 --> 00:31:59,182
Good night, Dale.

567
00:31:59,184 --> 00:32:00,283
Night, bud.

568
00:32:00,285 --> 00:32:01,151
Goodnight.

569
00:32:01,153 --> 00:32:01,851
Night.

570
00:32:01,853 --> 00:32:05,088
Good night. I'm glad
you liked the wine.

571
00:32:05,090 --> 00:32:08,458
Well, can I refreshen
your glass, your majesty?

572
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:10,660
Please.

573
00:32:10,662 --> 00:32:12,262
Whoa, that's good. Thank you.

574
00:32:12,264 --> 00:32:13,697
You're welcome.

575
00:32:13,699 --> 00:32:15,465
Here, babe.

576
00:32:15,467 --> 00:32:17,334
Seriously, Joel, enough.

577
00:32:19,303 --> 00:32:21,071
You're no good to me
when you're like this.

578
00:32:21,073 --> 00:32:22,205
Oh, come on.

579
00:32:22,207 --> 00:32:24,074
It's better when you're drunk.

580
00:32:24,076 --> 00:32:25,609
Not for me it's not.

581
00:32:25,611 --> 00:32:26,710
Whoa.

582
00:32:26,712 --> 00:32:29,079
Tough woman to please, huh?

583
00:32:29,081 --> 00:32:31,681
Buddy, you ain't kidding.

584
00:32:33,418 --> 00:32:34,718
I'm going to my room.

585
00:32:40,424 --> 00:32:42,125
Are you coming?

586
00:32:43,227 --> 00:32:46,730
Joel, the heart wants
what the heart wants.

587
00:32:47,832 --> 00:32:49,499
Not you, mongoloid.

588
00:32:49,501 --> 00:32:51,234
I'll be up in a minute, babe.

589
00:32:51,236 --> 00:32:52,369
Yeah. Fuck you.

590
00:32:54,672 --> 00:32:56,506
I'd get up there if I were you.

591
00:32:56,508 --> 00:32:58,508
The longer you wait.

592
00:32:58,809 --> 00:33:02,546
The bitchier she gets.

593
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:05,515
Too much to drink, Tedi boy.

594
00:33:06,250 --> 00:33:07,150
All right.

595
00:33:07,152 --> 00:33:09,352
Well, on that note.

596
00:33:10,454 --> 00:33:12,455
All right. I'll see
you guys later.

597
00:33:12,457 --> 00:33:15,458
Adios, amigos and, uh, feel free
to drink the rest of the wine.

598
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:16,660
- Thank you.
- It's all yours.

599
00:33:16,662 --> 00:33:17,494
Good night.

600
00:33:17,496 --> 00:33:19,496
No. Wait, oh god.

601
00:33:19,498 --> 00:33:21,131
I'm going to join you.

602
00:33:22,433 --> 00:33:24,067
Oh, oh.

603
00:33:24,069 --> 00:33:25,168
I got you.

604
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:26,169
I got you, big boy.

605
00:33:26,171 --> 00:33:27,537
Okay.

606
00:33:27,539 --> 00:33:28,638
There we go.

607
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:29,138
Up the stairs.

608
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:31,641
Hey, do you and lira
have any plans tonight?

609
00:33:31,643 --> 00:33:32,041
Yeah.

610
00:33:32,043 --> 00:33:36,079
I'm going to bury my sword so
deep in that stone-cold bitch,

611
00:33:36,081 --> 00:33:38,248
the first person who pulls it
out's going to get declared

612
00:33:38,250 --> 00:33:39,449
the king of England.

613
00:33:39,451 --> 00:33:40,717
Brothers.

614
00:33:41,652 --> 00:33:43,820
What are you two
jibber jabbering about?

615
00:33:43,822 --> 00:33:46,256
Just, just guy talk.

616
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:50,093
Got you, buddy. Careful.

617
00:33:50,095 --> 00:33:52,562
Someone's going to break
their neck on those things.

618
00:33:52,564 --> 00:33:54,431
Yeah, watch out.

619
00:33:54,433 --> 00:33:56,466
Tedi, isn't your
room downstairs?

620
00:33:56,468 --> 00:33:59,302
I thought we were going to tag
team like the Hardy boys?

621
00:33:59,704 --> 00:34:02,272
No three way for you tonight,
bud. Sorry.

622
00:34:02,274 --> 00:34:03,740
I wouldn't be so
sure about that.

623
00:34:03,742 --> 00:34:05,508
He's got two hands.

624
00:34:06,444 --> 00:34:08,144
Lira makes a joke.

625
00:34:08,646 --> 00:34:09,546
Tops.

626
00:34:14,452 --> 00:34:15,752
All right.

627
00:34:16,454 --> 00:34:18,688
Well, about time for
you to be hitting

628
00:34:18,690 --> 00:34:20,223
the old dusty trail, right?

629
00:34:20,225 --> 00:34:21,491
Yeah. I'm going to go.

630
00:34:21,493 --> 00:34:22,559
Good choice.

631
00:34:22,827 --> 00:34:26,563
You, uh, slay that
fire-breathing cocksucker.

632
00:34:27,231 --> 00:34:28,131
Bye.

633
00:34:28,566 --> 00:34:30,100
Are you, you okay?

634
00:34:30,102 --> 00:34:31,167
Yeah.

635
00:34:31,235 --> 00:34:32,402
Hey, Zac.

636
00:34:33,437 --> 00:34:34,537
Looking good.

637
00:34:47,318 --> 00:34:50,520
I think everyone's going
to get some action tonight.

638
00:34:50,522 --> 00:34:52,055
Good night, Tedi.

639
00:34:52,824 --> 00:34:54,157
Please.

640
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:55,258
Good night. Go.

641
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:56,426
Fine.

642
00:34:56,428 --> 00:34:59,362
But long live the
king of Arthur.

643
00:35:00,665 --> 00:35:06,336
Long live the... long live king Arthur.

644
00:35:07,071 --> 00:35:08,505
Long live the king.

645
00:35:08,507 --> 00:35:10,140
He is nuts.

646
00:35:10,775 --> 00:35:11,708
Fucking loon.

647
00:35:17,448 --> 00:35:19,549
You know you worry too much.

648
00:35:20,351 --> 00:35:22,152
You're probably right.

649
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:24,120
There's no probably to it.

650
00:35:24,122 --> 00:35:25,522
I'm always right.

651
00:35:26,457 --> 00:35:27,891
How could I forget?

652
00:35:28,492 --> 00:35:29,526
It happens.

653
00:35:38,469 --> 00:35:42,272
Um, you gonna come upstairs?

654
00:35:42,274 --> 00:35:43,573
Not yet.

655
00:35:44,442 --> 00:35:46,343
I'm going to wait
here for a while.

656
00:35:46,644 --> 00:35:49,145
See if Rita straggles in.

657
00:35:51,248 --> 00:35:52,182
All right.

658
00:35:59,457 --> 00:36:01,191
Don't stay up all night.

659
00:36:01,459 --> 00:36:02,559
I won't.

660
00:36:03,661 --> 00:36:05,362
Good night, Zac.

661
00:36:06,097 --> 00:36:07,564
Good night, Meigan.

662
00:36:39,296 --> 00:36:40,330
Rita?

663
00:36:42,666 --> 00:36:43,566
Rita?

664
00:36:48,272 --> 00:36:49,572
Are you in here?

665
00:36:50,074 --> 00:36:51,107
Rita?

666
00:37:18,637 --> 00:37:19,702
What was that?

667
00:37:19,704 --> 00:37:21,471
Shut up, Joel.

668
00:37:21,473 --> 00:37:22,839
Yeah.

669
00:37:22,841 --> 00:37:24,774
It was probably nothing.

670
00:39:05,643 --> 00:39:08,244
Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!

671
00:39:08,246 --> 00:39:09,445
<i>I fucking hate you!</i>

672
00:39:09,447 --> 00:39:11,648
Tessa, calm down.

673
00:39:11,650 --> 00:39:15,251
Shut up! Shut
up! Leave me alone!

674
00:39:15,253 --> 00:39:16,152
You know
what happens if you don't

675
00:39:16,154 --> 00:39:17,453
<i>calm down, right?</i>

676
00:39:17,455 --> 00:39:19,055
<i>We'll have to sedate you.</i>

677
00:39:19,057 --> 00:39:20,456
I'm going to kill you!

678
00:39:20,458 --> 00:39:23,359
<i>I'm going to kill you.</i>

679
00:39:39,610 --> 00:39:40,643
Hey.

680
00:39:40,645 --> 00:39:41,644
Jeez.

681
00:39:41,646 --> 00:39:43,079
Relax. It's just me.

682
00:39:43,081 --> 00:39:44,180
What are you trying to do?

683
00:39:44,182 --> 00:39:44,914
Scare me to death?

684
00:39:44,916 --> 00:39:45,414
Scare you?

685
00:39:45,416 --> 00:39:48,084
You're the one creeping
around in the fucking attic.

686
00:39:48,086 --> 00:39:49,652
I thought Hugo had gotten loose.

687
00:39:49,654 --> 00:39:51,454
I was halfway down
to the bait shop

688
00:39:51,456 --> 00:39:53,256
to pick up a bucket
of fish heads.

689
00:39:53,258 --> 00:39:54,257
Sorry.

690
00:39:54,259 --> 00:39:55,692
Hey, are you going
to come to bed?

691
00:39:55,694 --> 00:39:57,660
Think the fuck-a-thon
next door is over,

692
00:39:57,662 --> 00:40:00,063
so you and I actually
might get some sleep.

693
00:40:00,065 --> 00:40:02,365
Finally, some good news.

694
00:40:02,833 --> 00:40:05,301
What the hell are you
doing in the attic anyway?

695
00:40:08,105 --> 00:40:09,372
I don't know.

696
00:40:10,608 --> 00:40:12,275
All right, weirdo.

697
00:40:12,277 --> 00:40:13,242
Come on.

698
00:40:13,244 --> 00:40:14,143
Okay.

699
00:40:28,459 --> 00:40:30,360
Kill her.

700
00:40:32,796 --> 00:40:35,365
She lies.

701
00:40:35,566 --> 00:40:36,532
Who?

702
00:40:40,671 --> 00:40:41,771
Who?

703
00:40:43,674 --> 00:40:44,474
Hey.

704
00:40:44,476 --> 00:40:45,742
You all right, Zac?

705
00:40:47,044 --> 00:40:48,111
Yeah.

706
00:40:48,646 --> 00:40:49,545
You sure?

707
00:40:50,447 --> 00:40:51,514
Uh huh.

708
00:40:54,451 --> 00:40:56,352
Is Meigan in there with you?

709
00:40:59,256 --> 00:41:00,156
No.

710
00:41:02,259 --> 00:41:04,160
She's not into you, you know.

711
00:41:05,229 --> 00:41:06,362
Excuse me?

712
00:41:06,664 --> 00:41:09,165
I know you've got
this huge crush on her.

713
00:41:10,067 --> 00:41:11,534
It's totally obvious.

714
00:41:12,636 --> 00:41:14,570
But she's not over her ex.

715
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:19,342
Girls just kind of a sixth
sense about this sort of thing.

716
00:41:20,210 --> 00:41:22,111
You know, I'll bet she
even tried to call him

717
00:41:22,113 --> 00:41:23,346
while she was up here.

718
00:41:25,449 --> 00:41:26,482
Maybe.

719
00:41:26,484 --> 00:41:28,651
I don't know about you,
but that sure as hell

720
00:41:28,653 --> 00:41:30,553
would bug the shit out of me.

721
00:41:31,455 --> 00:41:35,758
Being all alone at night
next to the one you ache for.

722
00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:40,129
Being so close, yet so far.

723
00:41:41,432 --> 00:41:43,766
I bet that's got
you all pent up.

724
00:41:45,102 --> 00:41:46,469
What are you doing?

725
00:41:46,471 --> 00:41:48,337
What does it look
like I'm doing?

726
00:41:51,442 --> 00:41:52,675
What about your boyfriend?

727
00:41:52,677 --> 00:41:54,544
He's not my boyfriend.

728
00:41:54,546 --> 00:41:56,546
But we can sport fuck at best.

729
00:41:57,247 --> 00:41:59,148
You'd still be cheating on Joel.

730
00:42:00,084 --> 00:42:02,518
You know, I never really
liked the term cheating.

731
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:05,555
Makes it sound like I'm
playing some sort of game.

732
00:42:06,423 --> 00:42:07,590
Aren't you?

733
00:42:08,058 --> 00:42:08,791
What?

734
00:42:10,227 --> 00:42:11,360
Playing a game.

735
00:42:13,664 --> 00:42:18,134
If I win the game,
do I get a prize?

736
00:42:21,305 --> 00:42:22,705
Have you seen the Excedrin?

737
00:42:22,707 --> 00:42:24,540
Get your fucking
hands off of me!

738
00:42:25,743 --> 00:42:27,543
You okay?

739
00:42:28,145 --> 00:42:29,545
I don't want to talk about it.

740
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:45,094
Meigan, please calm down.

741
00:42:45,096 --> 00:42:46,596
Well, she still
isn't back yet, Dale.

742
00:42:46,598 --> 00:42:48,197
It's time someone worry.

743
00:42:48,199 --> 00:42:50,366
Hey, I wasn't
disagreeing with you, okay?

744
00:42:50,368 --> 00:42:51,667
Just don't get all panicky.

745
00:42:51,669 --> 00:42:52,802
We'll find her.

746
00:42:52,804 --> 00:42:54,270
It's been 24 hours.

747
00:42:54,272 --> 00:42:55,772
Obviously something's wrong.

748
00:42:55,774 --> 00:42:57,707
Rita never came back?

749
00:42:57,709 --> 00:42:58,474
No.

750
00:42:58,476 --> 00:42:59,675
We have to go look for her.

751
00:42:59,677 --> 00:43:00,643
Where's Tedi?

752
00:43:00,645 --> 00:43:02,044
Tedi?

753
00:43:02,046 --> 00:43:02,644
Tedi?

754
00:43:02,646 --> 00:43:04,480
Stop yelling, Dale.
I'm right here.

755
00:43:04,482 --> 00:43:06,282
Okay. There you are.
Get your shoes on.

756
00:43:06,284 --> 00:43:07,750
You've got to come with me
and find the caretaker.

757
00:43:07,752 --> 00:43:09,352
Let's see if maybe
seen Rita around.

758
00:43:09,354 --> 00:43:11,454
I'm in no condition
to go for a hike.

759
00:43:11,456 --> 00:43:14,056
Get your shoes on now or
spend the rest of the trip

760
00:43:14,058 --> 00:43:15,691
prying my foot out of your ass.

761
00:43:15,693 --> 00:43:17,293
Aye aye, captain.

762
00:43:17,295 --> 00:43:20,263
Zac, I need you to check
around the lake for me.

763
00:43:20,265 --> 00:43:21,564
You got it, boss.

764
00:43:22,666 --> 00:43:25,067
Lira, I want you to check
the local hiking trails.

765
00:43:25,069 --> 00:43:26,269
There's a map in my room.

766
00:43:26,271 --> 00:43:27,470
You can use that.

767
00:43:27,472 --> 00:43:29,438
You want to go tramping
through the woods?

768
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:30,640
Yes, I do.

769
00:43:30,642 --> 00:43:31,574
And take Joel with you.

770
00:43:31,576 --> 00:43:33,075
You'll cover more
ground that way.

771
00:43:33,077 --> 00:43:34,143
All right.

772
00:43:34,411 --> 00:43:35,545
Fuck.

773
00:43:36,814 --> 00:43:38,347
Bitch.

774
00:43:39,049 --> 00:43:41,450
Meigan, I need you to stay here
just in case she comes back.

775
00:43:41,452 --> 00:43:43,085
I'm not staying here.

776
00:43:43,087 --> 00:43:44,487
I want to help you guys.

777
00:43:44,489 --> 00:43:45,321
I know you do.

778
00:43:45,323 --> 00:43:46,823
That's why I want
you here, okay?

779
00:43:46,825 --> 00:43:49,592
If she's hurt or needs anything,
or something happens to us,

780
00:43:49,594 --> 00:43:52,094
I need someone here
I can count on. Okay?

781
00:43:52,096 --> 00:43:54,397
You want me to leave
that to lira, or Tedi?

782
00:43:55,232 --> 00:43:56,299
Guess not.

783
00:43:56,301 --> 00:43:58,301
And keep your phone on
just in the off chance

784
00:43:58,303 --> 00:43:59,368
you get a signal.

785
00:43:59,370 --> 00:44:00,670
- Okay.
- Okay.

786
00:44:00,672 --> 00:44:01,404
Tedi, let's go.

787
00:44:01,406 --> 00:44:02,271
<i>I'm coming.</i>

788
00:44:02,273 --> 00:44:04,740
No, not... move it, now, buddy.

789
00:44:05,642 --> 00:44:06,509
Good luck.

790
00:44:13,817 --> 00:44:15,051
What?

791
00:44:15,053 --> 00:44:16,552
What was that back there?

792
00:44:17,254 --> 00:44:18,287
With what?

793
00:44:18,289 --> 00:44:20,156
With that guy, Zac.

794
00:44:20,457 --> 00:44:23,392
Fucking Christ, Joel, not now.

795
00:44:24,512 --> 00:44:25,062
Oh, what?

796
00:44:25,063 --> 00:44:28,130
You going to have a conniption
fit or something?

797
00:44:28,632 --> 00:44:30,166
Or something.

798
00:44:30,467 --> 00:44:31,667
What's your problem?

799
00:44:31,669 --> 00:44:33,135
What was that back there?

800
00:44:33,137 --> 00:44:34,136
We were just talking.

801
00:44:34,138 --> 00:44:35,338
Bull shit.

802
00:44:37,741 --> 00:44:39,508
- Joel.
- I saw you.

803
00:44:42,446 --> 00:44:44,280
What are you saying?

804
00:44:44,282 --> 00:44:45,715
You know what I'm saying.

805
00:44:51,822 --> 00:44:53,756
He tried to kiss me.

806
00:44:58,228 --> 00:44:59,762
He came out onto the porch.

807
00:45:00,464 --> 00:45:02,131
He looked like
something was wrong.

808
00:45:02,133 --> 00:45:04,367
So I went over to
see if he was okay.

809
00:45:05,269 --> 00:45:06,669
And one thing led to another.

810
00:45:06,671 --> 00:45:09,338
I guess he took that as me
coming onto him or something.

811
00:45:12,209 --> 00:45:14,543
And it's not the first
time it's happened either.

812
00:45:15,812 --> 00:45:18,047
He does this all
the time at work.

813
00:45:18,049 --> 00:45:19,348
It's disgusting.

814
00:45:21,652 --> 00:45:23,219
Why don't you tell Dale?

815
00:45:23,221 --> 00:45:25,354
I did the first
time it happened.

816
00:45:26,223 --> 00:45:28,357
It's just my word against his.

817
00:45:29,459 --> 00:45:31,260
And Dale likes him.

818
00:45:31,262 --> 00:45:33,562
Everybody in the office does.

819
00:45:34,231 --> 00:45:35,364
Including you?

820
00:45:37,234 --> 00:45:39,502
What the hell kind of a
person do you think I am?

821
00:45:39,504 --> 00:45:42,672
There's something seriously
wrong with that guy.

822
00:45:42,674 --> 00:45:45,074
He's on all kinds of medication.

823
00:45:45,076 --> 00:45:46,509
He literally scares me.

824
00:45:49,813 --> 00:45:52,348
I just didn't want to because
any trouble or anything.

825
00:45:56,653 --> 00:45:58,154
Don't you trust me?

826
00:46:00,624 --> 00:46:03,125
I don't feel safe around him.

827
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:05,261
Hey, I'm sorry. Okay?

828
00:46:05,263 --> 00:46:06,462
No.

829
00:46:06,464 --> 00:46:07,730
Don't touch me.

830
00:46:11,234 --> 00:46:13,469
Why don't you be a man
and do something about it

831
00:46:13,471 --> 00:46:16,539
instead of tearing me down
with your bullshit accusations?

832
00:46:28,185 --> 00:46:29,318
Rita?

833
00:46:29,653 --> 00:46:31,687
Ricola?

834
00:46:31,689 --> 00:46:33,155
Bad joke, Tedi.

835
00:46:35,492 --> 00:46:36,659
Rita?

836
00:46:36,661 --> 00:46:37,560
Rita?

837
00:46:39,663 --> 00:46:41,130
Jesus?

838
00:46:43,667 --> 00:46:45,334
Worth a shot, right?

839
00:46:50,674 --> 00:46:52,541
You looking for birds?

840
00:46:53,043 --> 00:46:54,110
Bingo.

841
00:46:54,678 --> 00:46:55,745
Come on.

842
00:46:58,415 --> 00:47:00,249
Hey, I'm hungry, Dale.

843
00:47:00,251 --> 00:47:01,717
Yeah. We'll eat later.

844
00:47:09,126 --> 00:47:11,060
Should probably knock first.

845
00:47:11,062 --> 00:47:12,361
Why? The door's open.

846
00:47:15,665 --> 00:47:16,732
Anybody home?

847
00:47:18,668 --> 00:47:19,902
Earl ray?

848
00:47:20,670 --> 00:47:22,338
I don't think he's home.

849
00:47:24,553 --> 00:47:25,409
Door's locked.

850
00:47:25,410 --> 00:47:28,744
Why would the door be
locked if no one was here?

851
00:47:30,247 --> 00:47:31,280
Rita?

852
00:47:31,282 --> 00:47:32,348
You in there?

853
00:47:32,816 --> 00:47:34,150
Rita?

854
00:47:34,618 --> 00:47:36,485
If anybody's in
there, can you open up?

855
00:47:36,487 --> 00:47:37,787
We're missing one of our group.

856
00:47:37,789 --> 00:47:38,788
We need help.

857
00:47:38,790 --> 00:47:39,688
She can't hear us.

858
00:47:39,690 --> 00:47:40,723
I'm breaking it down.

859
00:47:40,725 --> 00:47:42,258
Easy, Tedi. This
isn't our house.

860
00:47:42,260 --> 00:47:44,126
You can't just go breaking
people's doors down.

861
00:47:44,128 --> 00:47:45,661
She's probably bound and gagged.

862
00:47:45,663 --> 00:47:47,430
There's blood and shit
all over the place.

863
00:47:47,432 --> 00:47:48,697
We can't just
leave her in there.

864
00:47:48,699 --> 00:47:50,366
We don't even know she's here.

865
00:47:53,670 --> 00:47:54,670
Rita?

866
00:47:54,672 --> 00:47:56,338
Quit fucking around.

867
00:47:58,275 --> 00:48:00,042
Just find this Earl ray guy.

868
00:48:00,044 --> 00:48:01,710
It's probably just a
big misunderstanding.

869
00:49:32,702 --> 00:49:35,471
"Investigators baffled by
brutal crime at a private"

870
00:49:35,473 --> 00:49:38,474
psychiatric hospital in the
mountains near Tearlon lake

871
00:49:38,476 --> 00:49:41,644
a female patient age nine, whose
name cannot be disclosed

872
00:49:41,646 --> 00:49:45,247
was allegedly attacked and brutally
mutilated by a male patient

873
00:49:45,249 --> 00:49:46,682
of the same age.

874
00:49:46,684 --> 00:49:48,050
According to the police report

875
00:49:48,052 --> 00:49:50,619
most of the girl's tongue
had been cut out

876
00:49:50,621 --> 00:49:52,655
with a pair of
surgical scissors.

877
00:49:52,657 --> 00:49:54,823
Registered sex offender
Earl ray Warren,

878
00:49:54,825 --> 00:49:57,426
who had been working as an
orderly at the Tearlon lake

879
00:49:57,428 --> 00:49:59,195
psychiatric hospital
was brought in

880
00:49:59,197 --> 00:50:01,530
for questioning after
investigators discovered

881
00:50:01,532 --> 00:50:05,334
shocking evidence of torture,
deprivation, and child abuse.

882
00:50:05,635 --> 00:50:08,470
Renowned psychiatrist
Dr. Herman Rexif

883
00:50:08,472 --> 00:50:10,673
has resigned as head
physician of the hospital

884
00:50:10,675 --> 00:50:13,108
and has refused to
answer any questions.

885
00:50:13,810 --> 00:50:16,178
"No charges have been
filed at this time."

886
00:50:24,588 --> 00:50:27,156
"Earl ray Warren was
released from police custody"

887
00:50:27,158 --> 00:50:30,726
yesterday after the conclusion
of the month-long investigation.

888
00:50:31,161 --> 00:50:33,829
Authorities could not produce
any evidence of wrongdoing,

889
00:50:33,831 --> 00:50:37,066
although Warren, age 46,
admitted to many bizarre

890
00:50:37,068 --> 00:50:40,236
and cruel methods of negative
reinforcement in the care

891
00:50:40,238 --> 00:50:41,670
and treatment of children,

892
00:50:41,672 --> 00:50:44,807
including a chamber
known only as the box,

893
00:50:44,809 --> 00:50:48,043
a tiny metal cell where children
were placed in isolation

894
00:50:48,045 --> 00:50:50,279
sometimes for days at a time.

895
00:50:50,281 --> 00:50:54,283
"It was done only on the direct
orders of the trained medical staff."

896
00:51:27,651 --> 00:51:30,119
So what'd you do today?

897
00:51:30,121 --> 00:51:31,553
<i>Colored.</i>

898
00:51:32,122 --> 00:51:34,323
Is this what you drew?

899
00:51:34,891 --> 00:51:35,824
You drew this?

900
00:51:35,826 --> 00:51:36,759
Yes.

901
00:51:39,195 --> 00:51:40,829
It's very good.

902
00:51:40,831 --> 00:51:42,264
Thank you.

903
00:51:42,266 --> 00:51:43,732
Is this your family?

904
00:51:44,668 --> 00:51:45,768
Yeah.

905
00:51:46,836 --> 00:51:48,671
Why are they on the ground?

906
00:51:48,673 --> 00:51:49,738
They're dead.

907
00:51:51,808 --> 00:51:53,542
How did they die?

908
00:51:54,210 --> 00:51:55,878
I don't know.

909
00:51:56,813 --> 00:51:58,714
Are you lying to me, Ned?

910
00:51:59,482 --> 00:52:00,649
I never lie.

911
00:52:00,651 --> 00:52:02,484
Then how did they die?

912
00:52:02,486 --> 00:52:03,652
God punished them.

913
00:52:03,654 --> 00:52:04,687
Why?

914
00:52:04,689 --> 00:52:06,522
He hates liars.

915
00:52:11,194 --> 00:52:13,162
Did you color anything else?

916
00:52:13,463 --> 00:52:13,862
No.

917
00:52:13,864 --> 00:52:17,533
The other kids came in, so
we went back to our room.

918
00:52:17,667 --> 00:52:20,169
So you weren't coloring alone.

919
00:52:20,603 --> 00:52:22,104
I'm never alone.

920
00:52:22,106 --> 00:52:23,272
Who was with you?

921
00:52:23,274 --> 00:52:25,507
The one the others
are afraid of.

922
00:52:26,576 --> 00:52:28,377
Does he have a name?

923
00:52:29,079 --> 00:52:29,778
I can't tell you.

924
00:52:29,780 --> 00:52:30,679
Why?

925
00:52:30,681 --> 00:52:32,348
He'll hurt me.

926
00:52:33,416 --> 00:52:35,351
Like he hurt Sarah?

927
00:52:35,652 --> 00:52:36,885
Not like that.

928
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:38,721
I don't know what he'll do.

929
00:52:41,257 --> 00:52:44,126
Did you see Sarah today?

930
00:52:44,828 --> 00:52:45,694
Yeah.

931
00:52:45,696 --> 00:52:47,296
She came into my room.

932
00:52:47,298 --> 00:52:48,364
What for?

933
00:52:49,432 --> 00:52:51,533
To wish me a happy birthday.

934
00:52:52,335 --> 00:52:54,203
I didn't realize it
was your birthday.

935
00:52:54,205 --> 00:52:55,738
Happy birthday, Ned.

936
00:52:56,506 --> 00:52:58,040
Thank you.

937
00:52:58,042 --> 00:53:00,109
Did she say anything else?

938
00:53:00,443 --> 00:53:02,678
She said my mommy was
downstairs with presents

939
00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:04,747
and a birthday cake.

940
00:53:05,248 --> 00:53:06,448
Well, would she say that?

941
00:53:06,450 --> 00:53:08,517
Nobody came to see you today.

942
00:53:09,219 --> 00:53:10,519
She lies.

943
00:53:12,822 --> 00:53:15,491
How long has it been
since you saw your parents?

944
00:53:15,493 --> 00:53:17,359
A long time ago.

945
00:53:17,660 --> 00:53:19,461
17 months since...

946
00:53:19,463 --> 00:53:21,163
I don't want to talk about this.

947
00:53:22,465 --> 00:53:23,766
Why not?

948
00:53:24,401 --> 00:53:25,768
It makes him angry.

949
00:53:36,079 --> 00:53:37,646
Dale, I really had a
feeling about that room.

950
00:53:37,648 --> 00:53:39,148
I think we should've gone in.

951
00:53:39,150 --> 00:53:41,316
We need more than a
feeling, Tedi, all right?

952
00:53:44,621 --> 00:53:45,454
Anything?

953
00:53:45,456 --> 00:53:46,655
Nothing. No sign of her.

954
00:53:46,657 --> 00:53:48,590
I was hoping she was back here.

955
00:53:49,058 --> 00:53:50,659
Did you find the caretaker?

956
00:53:50,661 --> 00:53:53,095
No. We found his cabin,
but nobody was home.

957
00:53:53,097 --> 00:53:54,530
It was strange.

958
00:53:55,265 --> 00:53:57,299
Didn't you say his
name was Warren?

959
00:53:57,301 --> 00:53:58,333
Yeah.

960
00:53:58,735 --> 00:54:00,235
Earl ray Warren?

961
00:54:00,237 --> 00:54:01,537
Yeah, why?

962
00:54:02,238 --> 00:54:04,239
- I think you need to see this.
- Later.

963
00:54:04,241 --> 00:54:06,241
We just came back to see
if she'd come back here.

964
00:54:06,243 --> 00:54:08,510
With her family connections,
if anything happens to her,

965
00:54:08,512 --> 00:54:10,245
I might as well kiss
this job goodbye.

966
00:54:10,247 --> 00:54:11,747
We're going to split up
until we find her.

967
00:54:11,749 --> 00:54:12,781
Or the old man.

968
00:54:12,783 --> 00:54:15,050
Okay. Well, be careful.
It could be dangerous.

969
00:54:15,052 --> 00:54:15,884
You, too.

970
00:54:24,394 --> 00:54:25,260
Fuck.

971
00:54:25,262 --> 00:54:26,395
God dammit, Zac.

972
00:54:26,397 --> 00:54:28,163
You've got to stop
doing that to me.

973
00:54:28,165 --> 00:54:29,097
Doing what?

974
00:54:29,099 --> 00:54:30,299
Scaring the shit out of me.

975
00:54:30,301 --> 00:54:32,334
You just backed into me.

976
00:54:33,670 --> 00:54:35,070
Any word on Rita?

977
00:54:35,072 --> 00:54:35,470
No.

978
00:54:35,472 --> 00:54:37,706
I was going to ask
you the same thing.

979
00:54:37,708 --> 00:54:39,541
Where the hell could should be?

980
00:54:40,176 --> 00:54:42,711
I don't know, Zac, but I'm
really starting to worry.

981
00:54:44,214 --> 00:54:46,882
I think the caretaker
might be a child molester.

982
00:54:48,117 --> 00:54:49,318
What?

983
00:54:50,620 --> 00:54:54,756
I found this article and
the guy's a sex offender.

984
00:54:56,292 --> 00:54:58,794
Did, did you tell Dale?

985
00:54:58,796 --> 00:54:59,194
No.

986
00:54:59,196 --> 00:55:02,364
I, I tried to, but he's
gone back to keep looking.

987
00:55:03,266 --> 00:55:04,666
That's not even the worst of it.

988
00:55:04,668 --> 00:55:05,501
Look at this.

989
00:55:12,675 --> 00:55:14,576
Where did you get this?

990
00:55:16,646 --> 00:55:17,442
In the attic.

991
00:55:20,483 --> 00:55:24,119
This place used to be some
kind of mental hospital.

992
00:55:26,456 --> 00:55:29,157
Guess that explains why
they got the place so cheap.

993
00:55:29,526 --> 00:55:31,326
It's not funny.

994
00:55:31,794 --> 00:55:34,096
The authorities
shut this place down.

995
00:55:34,098 --> 00:55:36,365
They were torturing children.

996
00:55:37,100 --> 00:55:38,467
Fucking kids, Zac.

997
00:55:38,469 --> 00:55:39,668
Yeah, I get it.

998
00:55:39,670 --> 00:55:40,669
Young people.

999
00:55:40,671 --> 00:55:42,337
I... it's terrible.

1000
00:55:46,175 --> 00:55:47,376
Are you okay?

1001
00:55:47,644 --> 00:55:48,510
No.

1002
00:55:53,483 --> 00:55:57,419
I wasn't going to tell you this,
but I've been seeing

1003
00:55:57,421 --> 00:55:59,555
some pretty weird
stuff around here myself.

1004
00:56:01,224 --> 00:56:02,558
What?

1005
00:56:03,459 --> 00:56:05,327
Why didn't you tell me?

1006
00:56:06,396 --> 00:56:08,530
I didn't think that
you'd believe me.

1007
00:56:09,432 --> 00:56:12,568
As soon as Rita gets back we're
getting the hell out of here.

1008
00:56:14,437 --> 00:56:16,838
There's something not
right about this place.

1009
00:56:16,840 --> 00:56:19,708
Great. I'm going to go back out
and see if I can't find her.

1010
00:56:21,778 --> 00:56:23,312
Be safe.

1011
00:56:23,813 --> 00:56:25,113
I will.

1012
00:56:26,215 --> 00:56:32,187
Here, um, take this just in
case that pervert comes back,

1013
00:56:32,189 --> 00:56:33,255
or wherever.

1014
00:56:33,257 --> 00:56:35,324
I want you to be safe.

1015
00:56:35,792 --> 00:56:37,125
Thanks.

1016
00:56:39,395 --> 00:56:41,330
Please come back in one piece?

1017
00:56:41,698 --> 00:56:42,731
I will.

1018
00:56:43,700 --> 00:56:45,567
Please extend me
the same courtesy.

1019
00:56:45,569 --> 00:56:46,568
I'll be back.

1020
00:57:43,426 --> 00:57:44,526
Jesus.

1021
00:57:46,062 --> 00:57:47,362
Hey, Joel.

1022
00:57:48,798 --> 00:57:50,065
Did they find Rita?

1023
00:57:50,067 --> 00:57:51,500
I'm not looking for Rita.

1024
00:57:51,502 --> 00:57:52,300
What?

1025
00:57:52,302 --> 00:57:53,769
I'm looking for you.

1026
00:57:58,241 --> 00:57:59,474
What the fuck?

1027
00:57:59,476 --> 00:58:00,809
What the hell is your problem?

1028
00:58:00,811 --> 00:58:03,111
You're my fucking problem.

1029
00:58:04,213 --> 00:58:06,348
You stay the fuck away from her.

1030
00:58:08,051 --> 00:58:09,551
I didn't touch her.

1031
00:58:10,219 --> 00:58:12,054
She's the one that kissed me.

1032
00:58:12,056 --> 00:58:13,722
You calling my girl a liar?

1033
00:58:14,457 --> 00:58:15,524
No, Joel.

1034
00:58:16,225 --> 00:58:17,359
I'm not.

1035
00:58:19,262 --> 00:58:20,562
I'm calling her a slut.

1036
00:58:21,664 --> 00:58:23,165
And a liar.

1037
00:58:26,470 --> 00:58:28,136
You fucker.

1038
00:58:28,471 --> 00:58:29,905
It's not worth it, man.

1039
00:58:30,406 --> 00:58:31,540
Joel, stop.

1040
00:58:50,426 --> 00:58:51,660
Joel, stop!

1041
00:58:59,669 --> 00:59:02,537
Help! Help!

1042
01:00:16,646 --> 01:00:17,512
Rita?

1043
01:00:19,649 --> 01:00:21,116
Mr. Warren?

1044
01:00:22,785 --> 01:00:23,685
Come on, guys.

1045
01:00:23,687 --> 01:00:25,754
I fucking hate hiking.

1046
01:00:26,422 --> 01:00:27,522
Rita?

1047
01:00:43,272 --> 01:00:44,372
Rita?

1048
01:00:45,441 --> 01:00:46,508
Mr. Warren?

1049
01:00:54,250 --> 01:00:55,517
Oh, shit.

1050
01:00:58,487 --> 01:00:59,554
What the fuck?

1051
01:01:22,445 --> 01:01:23,545
You guys?

1052
01:01:26,415 --> 01:01:27,349
Hello?

1053
01:01:30,453 --> 01:01:31,319
Dale?

1054
01:02:24,840 --> 01:02:26,508
Anyone down here?

1055
01:02:35,685 --> 01:02:36,751
Someone there?

1056
01:02:42,191 --> 01:02:43,258
Hello?

1057
01:03:32,141 --> 01:03:33,808
You're in a lot of trouble.

1058
01:03:33,810 --> 01:03:35,610
I didn't do anything.

1059
01:03:35,612 --> 01:03:37,278
Yes, you did.

1060
01:03:37,280 --> 01:03:39,447
Please don't put
me back in the box.

1061
01:03:39,449 --> 01:03:41,216
I didn't do it.

1062
01:03:41,218 --> 01:03:43,451
I tried to stop him,
but he doesn't listen.

1063
01:03:43,453 --> 01:03:45,320
I couldn't make him stop.

1064
01:03:45,322 --> 01:03:47,255
Just tell me what happened.

1065
01:03:52,661 --> 01:03:53,561
Ned?

1066
01:03:56,265 --> 01:03:57,165
Ned?

1067
01:03:58,701 --> 01:03:59,567
No.

1068
01:04:03,105 --> 01:04:04,339
No what?

1069
01:04:04,673 --> 01:04:06,741
Ned's not here right now.

1070
01:04:08,444 --> 01:04:09,711
Then where is he?

1071
01:04:10,446 --> 01:04:12,313
That's not important.

1072
01:04:13,649 --> 01:04:14,749
I see.

1073
01:04:15,785 --> 01:04:19,354
Then can you tell me
what happened to Sarah?

1074
01:04:20,456 --> 01:04:22,123
I don't think so.

1075
01:04:23,459 --> 01:04:25,727
Can't or won't?

1076
01:04:35,438 --> 01:04:36,571
What the hell?

1077
01:04:37,073 --> 01:04:38,540
Hey, Maigen?

1078
01:04:59,462 --> 01:05:01,362
Who are you?

1079
01:05:03,265 --> 01:05:04,365
Tell me.

1080
01:05:05,267 --> 01:05:06,568
It's not important.

1081
01:05:06,570 --> 01:05:08,136
Oh, I think it is.

1082
01:05:09,271 --> 01:05:11,172
I don't care what you think.

1083
01:05:12,074 --> 01:05:13,641
Then may I speak with Ned?

1084
01:05:13,643 --> 01:05:15,076
Is he still here?

1085
01:05:15,078 --> 01:05:17,545
You're speaking with me now.

1086
01:05:27,223 --> 01:05:28,323
Hello?

1087
01:05:30,092 --> 01:05:31,559
Anybody down here?

1088
01:05:32,261 --> 01:05:33,461
<i>Okay.</i>

1089
01:05:33,463 --> 01:05:37,165
So tell me what happened.

1090
01:05:38,100 --> 01:05:39,701
You know what happened.

1091
01:05:39,703 --> 01:05:41,269
But do you?

1092
01:05:41,271 --> 01:05:43,338
Of course I do.

1093
01:05:44,473 --> 01:05:47,075
So it was you.

1094
01:05:47,077 --> 01:05:48,443
Who else could it be?

1095
01:05:48,445 --> 01:05:49,477
Ned?

1096
01:05:49,479 --> 01:05:51,146
Ned wouldn't hurt a fly.

1097
01:05:51,447 --> 01:05:53,515
He's too much of a sissy.

1098
01:05:53,816 --> 01:05:55,550
Is somebody down here?

1099
01:06:01,457 --> 01:06:03,124
Rita, is that you?

1100
01:06:03,659 --> 01:06:05,460
You took something from her.

1101
01:06:05,462 --> 01:06:06,461
Uh huh.

1102
01:06:06,463 --> 01:06:07,495
What did you take?

1103
01:06:07,497 --> 01:06:09,898
You know what it was.

1104
01:06:11,667 --> 01:06:13,568
Why would you do that?

1105
01:06:14,436 --> 01:06:16,571
Liars must be punished.

1106
01:06:22,311 --> 01:06:23,678
What do you do with it?

1107
01:06:23,680 --> 01:06:24,679
Rita?

1108
01:06:24,681 --> 01:06:25,647
<i>With what?</i>

1109
01:06:25,649 --> 01:06:26,648
Rita?

1110
01:06:27,817 --> 01:06:29,450
Her tongue.

1111
01:06:59,215 --> 01:07:00,648
Oh god. Up you go.

1112
01:07:00,650 --> 01:07:01,649
Come on.

1113
01:07:01,651 --> 01:07:03,351
What the fuck?

1114
01:07:04,620 --> 01:07:05,553
Come on.

1115
01:07:06,655 --> 01:07:07,589
Come on.

1116
01:07:10,660 --> 01:07:12,560
What the hell happened to her?

1117
01:07:13,429 --> 01:07:14,329
Come on.

1118
01:07:21,470 --> 01:07:22,704
Dude, she needs help.

1119
01:07:22,706 --> 01:07:24,105
Yeah, no shit, Zac.

1120
01:07:24,107 --> 01:07:25,740
She's going to fucking
bleed to death.

1121
01:07:25,742 --> 01:07:28,443
Well, um, I'll start a fire.

1122
01:07:28,445 --> 01:07:28,743
What?

1123
01:07:28,745 --> 01:07:31,746
You heat metal,
cauterize the wound.

1124
01:07:31,748 --> 01:07:33,248
We don't have
time for that shit.

1125
01:07:33,250 --> 01:07:35,216
Well, I'm not a
fucking doctor, Zac.

1126
01:07:35,218 --> 01:07:35,716
Where's Dale?

1127
01:07:35,718 --> 01:07:38,686
I don't know. He's probably
still looking for Rita.

1128
01:07:38,688 --> 01:07:39,887
Fuck.

1129
01:07:40,422 --> 01:07:45,560
Um, speaking
of Rita, I found her.

1130
01:07:46,428 --> 01:07:47,595
Where?

1131
01:07:48,430 --> 01:07:50,365
In the basement.

1132
01:07:51,267 --> 01:07:52,767
She's dead.

1133
01:07:53,269 --> 01:07:54,502
Dead?

1134
01:07:54,504 --> 01:07:55,803
Are you sure?

1135
01:07:57,106 --> 01:07:58,072
Are you sure?

1136
01:07:58,074 --> 01:07:59,307
Yeah, I'm pretty sure.

1137
01:07:59,309 --> 01:08:01,242
Fuck, she's getting
blood all over the place.

1138
01:08:01,244 --> 01:08:03,645
Just go and find Dale and
I'll stay here with her.

1139
01:08:03,647 --> 01:08:06,281
I don't know where Dale is. I...

1140
01:08:06,283 --> 01:08:08,049
Just fucking go find him! Go!

1141
01:08:08,051 --> 01:08:08,883
Fine!

1142
01:08:11,053 --> 01:08:12,120
Come on.

1143
01:08:19,194 --> 01:08:20,662
What did you do with it?

1144
01:08:20,664 --> 01:08:22,463
<i>With what?</i>

1145
01:08:22,465 --> 01:08:24,265
Her tongue.

1146
01:08:24,267 --> 01:08:26,234
<i>It's in the box.</i>

1147
01:08:26,236 --> 01:08:28,069
Nurses already looked in there.

1148
01:08:28,071 --> 01:08:29,671
Not that box.

1149
01:08:29,673 --> 01:08:31,572
My box.

1150
01:08:32,441 --> 01:08:33,641
Music box.

1151
01:09:02,438 --> 01:09:03,304
Shit.

1152
01:09:06,809 --> 01:09:07,642
Where's Tedi?

1153
01:09:07,644 --> 01:09:09,043
How the hell should I know?

1154
01:09:09,045 --> 01:09:10,445
He just went out
looking for you.

1155
01:09:10,447 --> 01:09:11,512
What happened to her?

1156
01:09:14,950 --> 01:09:15,717
What?

1157
01:09:15,719 --> 01:09:17,685
We got to get her to a hospital.

1158
01:09:17,687 --> 01:09:18,786
I'm on it. I'm on it.

1159
01:09:18,788 --> 01:09:19,654
Fuck.

1160
01:09:19,656 --> 01:09:20,421
Give her to me.

1161
01:09:20,423 --> 01:09:21,522
Where's everyone else?

1162
01:09:21,524 --> 01:09:22,790
They went out looking for Rita.

1163
01:09:22,792 --> 01:09:24,392
Fuck.

1164
01:09:24,626 --> 01:09:26,461
Dale, there's something
I got to tell you.

1165
01:09:26,463 --> 01:09:27,795
If I don't leave right now,
she's going to fucking

1166
01:09:27,797 --> 01:09:28,629
bleed to death.

1167
01:09:28,631 --> 01:09:29,831
You find everyone else.

1168
01:09:29,833 --> 01:09:30,832
You get to a signal.

1169
01:09:30,834 --> 01:09:32,533
And you fucking call me.

1170
01:10:03,265 --> 01:10:04,198
Ned?

1171
01:10:08,270 --> 01:10:09,437
Ned?

1172
01:10:09,439 --> 01:10:13,107
Twinkle, twinkle in their eyes

1173
01:10:13,109 --> 01:10:16,511
cut out tongues
that tell me lies.

1174
01:10:17,346 --> 01:10:18,546
Ned?

1175
01:10:19,148 --> 01:10:20,681
Why do you keep calling me that?

1176
01:10:20,683 --> 01:10:22,350
That's your name.

1177
01:10:23,085 --> 01:10:24,552
Everyone calls you Ned.

1178
01:10:25,220 --> 01:10:26,721
I hate that name.

1179
01:10:27,656 --> 01:10:30,324
You're the one Ned warned
me about, aren't you?

1180
01:10:31,226 --> 01:10:32,894
The one he tried to stop?

1181
01:10:34,229 --> 01:10:35,897
Ned can't stop me.

1182
01:10:36,632 --> 01:10:39,767
But he does know
what you did to Sarah.

1183
01:10:40,669 --> 01:10:42,537
Everyone knows that.

1184
01:10:43,472 --> 01:10:45,239
And he's afraid of you.

1185
01:10:45,241 --> 01:10:47,141
They're all afraid of me.

1186
01:10:48,444 --> 01:10:50,545
So why don't you
tell me who you are?

1187
01:10:51,246 --> 01:10:53,347
Or at least who
you think you are?

1188
01:10:54,049 --> 01:10:55,450
Why do you want to know?

1189
01:10:55,452 --> 01:10:57,218
It's my job to
know what's going on

1190
01:10:57,220 --> 01:10:58,519
inside that head of yours.

1191
01:10:58,521 --> 01:11:00,555
I guess you could
call it curiosity.

1192
01:11:01,256 --> 01:11:04,525
Ask the cat what
curiosity can do.

1193
01:12:19,434 --> 01:12:20,535
Hello?

1194
01:12:20,836 --> 01:12:22,370
Anybody?

1195
01:12:23,472 --> 01:12:24,572
Hey, Zac?

1196
01:12:28,410 --> 01:12:29,544
Zac?

1197
01:12:30,045 --> 01:12:31,345
Hey, Zac?

1198
01:12:50,165 --> 01:12:51,232
Tedi!

1199
01:12:53,468 --> 01:12:54,335
You.

1200
01:12:55,671 --> 01:12:57,171
Where is she?

1201
01:12:58,240 --> 01:12:59,073
Who?

1202
01:12:59,075 --> 01:13:01,108
Don't play games with me, boy.

1203
01:13:01,476 --> 01:13:02,743
She's got to be here.

1204
01:13:05,247 --> 01:13:06,447
Are you talking about Rita?

1205
01:13:06,449 --> 01:13:07,748
Where is she?

1206
01:13:09,251 --> 01:13:10,551
She's here.

1207
01:13:12,654 --> 01:13:14,188
Is she okay?

1208
01:13:14,456 --> 01:13:15,323
No.

1209
01:13:16,258 --> 01:13:17,124
She's not.

1210
01:13:17,126 --> 01:13:18,359
Son of a bitch.

1211
01:13:19,061 --> 01:13:20,528
I know who you are.

1212
01:13:21,430 --> 01:13:23,331
I know what you do.

1213
01:13:25,300 --> 01:13:26,534
You just stay back.

1214
01:13:27,202 --> 01:13:28,235
Stay back!

1215
01:13:31,073 --> 01:13:34,875
Tell me, grandpa, did she
scream when you fucked her?

1216
01:13:36,244 --> 01:13:37,745
I never touched her.

1217
01:13:38,447 --> 01:13:40,314
Pretty little thing like that?

1218
01:13:40,649 --> 01:13:42,183
I'm sure you wanted to.

1219
01:13:42,185 --> 01:13:43,551
Never touched her.

1220
01:13:59,635 --> 01:14:01,769
Is it because you loved her?

1221
01:14:02,638 --> 01:14:04,772
Or because she wasn't a boy?

1222
01:14:05,407 --> 01:14:06,874
How dare you.

1223
01:14:09,311 --> 01:14:10,344
Zac?

1224
01:14:29,331 --> 01:14:32,266
What do you think
about that, huh?

1225
01:14:32,268 --> 01:14:34,468
How you like it,
you son of a bitch.

1226
01:14:34,470 --> 01:14:35,469
Huh?

1227
01:14:35,471 --> 01:14:36,904
See how you like it.

1228
01:14:50,118 --> 01:14:51,352
Are you okay?

1229
01:14:56,125 --> 01:14:58,192
I'm sure glad
I gave you that knife.

1230
01:14:59,661 --> 01:15:01,195
Can you stand?

1231
01:15:02,230 --> 01:15:03,297
Yeah.

1232
01:15:11,474 --> 01:15:13,441
- No, no. Don't look.
- Oh god.

1233
01:15:13,443 --> 01:15:14,542
Don't look.

1234
01:15:21,650 --> 01:15:22,550
Tedi.

1235
01:15:23,819 --> 01:15:24,685
It's okay.

1236
01:15:24,687 --> 01:15:25,753
It's okay.

1237
01:15:32,094 --> 01:15:33,327
Let's get out of here.

1238
01:15:47,275 --> 01:15:48,809
Oh shit.

1239
01:15:48,811 --> 01:15:49,877
What?

1240
01:15:51,079 --> 01:15:53,114
I don't have the keys.

1241
01:15:53,648 --> 01:15:56,751
My wallet, clothes,
everything, it's inside.

1242
01:15:59,654 --> 01:16:01,288
I'll go in. I'll be quick.

1243
01:16:01,290 --> 01:16:02,323
Zac.

1244
01:16:05,211 --> 01:16:05,660
Here.

1245
01:16:05,661 --> 01:16:06,359
Where the hell did you get that?

1246
01:16:06,361 --> 01:16:09,130
It doesn't matter. I just
want you to take it.

1247
01:16:09,132 --> 01:16:10,030
I need to know that you're safe.

1248
01:16:10,032 --> 01:16:10,831
No.

1249
01:16:10,833 --> 01:16:12,767
A gun, Zac. Please, you take it.

1250
01:16:13,168 --> 01:16:15,102
Just get the keys
and get the fuck out.

1251
01:16:15,104 --> 01:16:16,137
I'll be okay.

1252
01:16:16,139 --> 01:16:17,171
I'll be right back.

1253
01:16:23,546 --> 01:16:25,546
Did you forget something?

1254
01:16:25,548 --> 01:16:27,148
Yeah.

1255
01:16:27,150 --> 01:16:27,882
I did.

1256
01:16:36,158 --> 01:16:38,325
Be careful.

1257
01:16:38,827 --> 01:16:39,827
I will.

1258
01:16:39,829 --> 01:16:41,162
I'll be right back.

1259
01:17:21,069 --> 01:17:22,136
Hello?

1260
01:17:25,473 --> 01:17:26,874
Anybody home?

1261
01:17:35,817 --> 01:17:36,817
Rita, wait.

1262
01:17:36,819 --> 01:17:38,085
Is he dead?

1263
01:17:38,087 --> 01:17:39,453
You don't understand.

1264
01:17:39,455 --> 01:17:41,088
What don't I understand?

1265
01:17:41,090 --> 01:17:42,656
You don't understand what he is.

1266
01:17:42,658 --> 01:17:44,758
I don't know my own grandfather?

1267
01:17:45,260 --> 01:17:46,694
What did you do to him?

1268
01:17:46,696 --> 01:17:48,529
Pap pap, are you okay?

1269
01:17:51,499 --> 01:17:52,766
Stay back!

1270
01:17:57,239 --> 01:17:58,906
Maigen, no.

1271
01:17:59,808 --> 01:18:01,108
Let go, Rita.

1272
01:18:09,417 --> 01:18:10,784
Son of a bitch.

1273
01:18:44,452 --> 01:18:47,354
You didn't really think you'd
get away with it, did you?

1274
01:19:12,647 --> 01:19:14,882
Tell me who you are.

1275
01:19:15,450 --> 01:19:17,751
You didn't say please.

1276
01:19:18,720 --> 01:19:22,556
Perhaps you'd like to
think it over in the box?

1277
01:19:28,763 --> 01:19:29,797
I'm waiting.

1278
01:19:34,469 --> 01:19:35,803
Zachary.

1279
01:19:36,538 --> 01:19:38,539
Zachary.

1280
01:19:40,710 --> 01:19:42,343
<i>Come in.</i>

1281
01:19:43,611 --> 01:19:46,146
Hi, I believe you
were looking for this.

1282
01:19:46,448 --> 01:19:47,414
Yes.

1283
01:19:47,416 --> 01:19:48,716
Set it on my desk.

1284
01:19:52,754 --> 01:19:55,322
Take the patient
back to his room.

1285
01:19:56,424 --> 01:19:57,558
Yes, sir.

1286
01:19:58,426 --> 01:20:01,762
And see to it he doesn't
get in any more trouble.

1287
01:20:02,464 --> 01:20:03,564
Understand?

1288
01:20:04,666 --> 01:20:05,899
You can count on me.

1289
01:20:35,397 --> 01:20:37,131
You don't have to do that.

1290
01:20:37,665 --> 01:20:39,333
If you didn't want my help, Ned,

1291
01:20:40,235 --> 01:20:42,336
you shouldn't have asked for it.

1292
01:20:43,438 --> 01:20:45,372
He's still alive, you know.

1293
01:20:46,241 --> 01:20:47,574
Not for long.

1294
01:20:55,451 --> 01:20:57,885
Such a naughty little boy.

1295
01:21:01,823 --> 01:21:03,724
And you know what
happens to naughty

1296
01:21:03,726 --> 01:21:05,759
little boys here, right?

1297
01:21:07,128 --> 01:21:08,328
Yeah.

1298
01:21:08,830 --> 01:21:11,532
I'll see you again real soon.

1299
01:21:12,467 --> 01:21:14,334
And you better not scream.

1300
01:21:16,805 --> 01:21:19,740
You don't want to get in
trouble again, do you?

1301
01:21:37,092 --> 01:21:39,326
Such a good boy.

1302
01:21:53,174 --> 01:21:55,309
Stop being so difficult.

1303
01:22:04,687 --> 01:22:06,353
Scream all you want.

1304
01:22:07,822 --> 01:22:08,889
Nobody will hear you.

1305
01:22:11,493 --> 01:22:12,292
No!

1306
01:22:12,294 --> 01:22:13,260
Oh god!

1307
01:22:23,438 --> 01:22:24,571
Son of a bitch.

1308
01:22:45,460 --> 01:22:46,460
Dale?

1309
01:22:46,462 --> 01:22:49,163
Zac, I'm at the hospital.

1310
01:22:49,664 --> 01:22:51,198
Yeah, lira's going to make it.

1311
01:22:51,200 --> 01:22:52,466
She's getting a transfusion now.

1312
01:22:52,468 --> 01:22:53,800
But she lost a lot of blood.

1313
01:22:53,802 --> 01:22:56,069
But she got lucky.

1314
01:22:56,071 --> 01:22:57,671
Believe me, I, I know.

1315
01:22:57,673 --> 01:22:59,506
They're at the hospital.

1316
01:22:59,508 --> 01:23:01,308
Lira, she's going to make it.

1317
01:23:01,776 --> 01:23:03,343
Is that Maigen with you?

1318
01:23:03,745 --> 01:23:05,179
Yeah, it is.

1319
01:23:05,446 --> 01:23:07,181
Hey, Dale.

1320
01:23:07,448 --> 01:23:08,782
Who else is with you?

1321
01:23:09,083 --> 01:23:10,317
<i>It's just us.</i>

1322
01:23:13,121 --> 01:23:14,354
What do you mean?

1323
01:23:14,656 --> 01:23:18,192
I mean it's just us.

1324
01:23:19,093 --> 01:23:20,827
There isn't anybody else.

1325
01:23:20,829 --> 01:23:22,563
Please tell me you're joking.

1326
01:23:22,830 --> 01:23:24,431
He's not joking, Dale.

1327
01:23:24,433 --> 01:23:25,832
We wouldn't even
have got out ourselves

1328
01:23:25,834 --> 01:23:27,534
if it wasn't for Maigen.

1329
01:23:28,403 --> 01:23:29,570
God.

1330
01:23:30,271 --> 01:23:32,339
Do you want us to
come to the hospital?

1331
01:23:35,143 --> 01:23:35,976
<i>Dale?</i>

1332
01:23:35,978 --> 01:23:36,710
No.

1333
01:23:36,712 --> 01:23:38,512
Uh, get your butts home.

1334
01:23:39,447 --> 01:23:40,681
I should check on lira.

1335
01:23:40,683 --> 01:23:42,149
<i>Hey, wait.</i>

1336
01:23:42,817 --> 01:23:46,720
By any chance did lira
say who did this to her?

1337
01:23:46,988 --> 01:23:47,587
No.

1338
01:23:47,589 --> 01:23:49,256
She, uh, she said it was dark.

1339
01:23:49,258 --> 01:23:50,791
She didn't really
remember anything,

1340
01:23:51,659 --> 01:23:53,560
it was the old man.

1341
01:23:54,262 --> 01:23:55,362
Mr. Warren.

1342
01:23:57,465 --> 01:23:58,465
<i>All right.</i>

1343
01:23:58,467 --> 01:23:59,333
All right.

1344
01:23:59,335 --> 01:24:01,768
Uh, just let me
take care of things.

1345
01:24:01,770 --> 01:24:02,368
You get some rest.

1346
01:24:02,370 --> 01:24:05,105
I'll call the police and get
this whole thing squared away.

1347
01:24:05,107 --> 01:24:06,106
Okay, Dale.

1348
01:24:06,108 --> 01:24:07,708
You take care.

1349
01:24:08,243 --> 01:24:09,343
You too, Zac.

1350
01:24:43,411 --> 01:24:45,746
You brought that
awful thing with you?

1351
01:24:48,816 --> 01:24:50,384
Yeah, I did.

1352
01:24:50,818 --> 01:24:52,219
Why?

1353
01:24:52,420 --> 01:24:53,687
I don't know.

1354
01:24:53,689 --> 01:24:55,589
Used to have one as a kid.

1355
01:24:56,057 --> 01:24:59,159
I guess you can call it
me being sentimental.

1356
01:25:00,461 --> 01:25:02,162
Oh my god.

1357
01:25:03,798 --> 01:25:05,365
Oh my god.

1358
01:25:06,467 --> 01:25:07,234
What?

1359
01:25:07,236 --> 01:25:08,201
Zac.

1360
01:25:08,503 --> 01:25:09,770
What?

1361
01:25:10,471 --> 01:25:11,838
Rita's still out there.

1362
01:25:11,840 --> 01:25:13,740
We can't just leave her there.

1363
01:25:16,444 --> 01:25:21,548
Maigen, um, Tedi found Rita.

1364
01:25:24,419 --> 01:25:26,153
Well, where is she then?

1365
01:25:29,691 --> 01:25:31,158
Where is she?

1366
01:25:40,201 --> 01:25:41,234
Dale!

1367
01:25:42,670 --> 01:25:44,538
Is anybody here?

1368
01:25:45,506 --> 01:25:46,873
Shh.

1369
01:25:50,712 --> 01:25:55,749
I guess you can say that
she's in a better place.

1370
01:26:31,652 --> 01:26:33,286
I don't know what
I would've done

1371
01:26:33,288 --> 01:26:34,755
if you hadn't been there today.

1372
01:31:10,564 --> 01:31:13,366
Don't stick your
tongue out at me.
