all the concerned parents out there?

Well, Kip, I honestly don't understand
what all the fuss is about.

168
00:10:22,921 --> 00:10:25,389

<i>It's about being a girl</i>

Ew. It's about how...

172
00:10:36,401 --> 00:10:38,801

<i>sometimes you get down on your knees</i>

What about your first big hit,
"Take Me From Behind"?

176

"Take Me From Behind"
isn't sexual at all.

177
00:10:57,322 --> 00:11:00,382
It's about love sneaking up on you.

You know, like from the behind.

201

00:38:51,228 --> 00:38:53,719
Mr. Roberts, let's start with you.

645
00:38:53,797 --> 00:38:59,133
Your organization is not pleased with
this film's depiction of African Americans.

646
00:38:59,202 --> 00:39:02,069
Oh, that is absolutely correct, Kenneth.

647
00:39:02,138 --> 00:39:04,436
We are just about halfway
through the film...

648
00:39:04,507 --> 00:39:08,170
and we've yet to see a dignified
portrayal of a person of color.

649
00:39:08,245 --> 00:39:12,682
So far, we've only been shown
as vicious criminals or sex fiends.

650
00:39:12,749 --> 00:39:14,717
Just take a look at that last sketch.

651
00:39:14,784 --> 00:39:17,116
So, what specifically
is your group demanding?

652
00:39:17,187 --> 00:39:21,214
The filmmakers put a positive black role model
on that screen in the next 10 minutes...

653
00:39:21,291 --> 00:39:25,921
<i>or we will be organizing a nationwide</i>
<i>walkout of black moviegoers.</i>

654
00:39:25,996 --> 00:39:29,397
That means every single African American
currently watching this film...

655
00:39:29,466 --> 00:39:31,400
will exit the theater.

00:39:31,468 --> 00:39:33,732
<i>Mr. Nakatami,</i>
<i>you are equally unhappy?</i>

657

658
00:39:36,539 --> 00:39:40,498
<i>or, at the most, two,</i>
<i>three Asian faces in the film.</i>

<i>Brendan Laroux's story is one of dreams.</i>

881
00:55:53,949 --> 00:55:57,112
<i>As a young boy,</i>
<i>he wanted to become a dancer...</i>

882
00:55:57,186 --> 00:55:59,950
<i>but at the age of 12,</i>
<i>he lost his legs.</i>

883
00:56:00,022 --> 00:56:02,354
<i>Now, this would be a setback</i>
<i>for any youngster...</i>

884
00:56:02,424 --> 00:56:06,292
<i>but not Brendan, who set</i>
<i>his eyes on being a surgeon...</i>

885
00:56:06,362 --> 00:56:09,763
<i>until, at age 14,</i>
<i>he lost his wrists.</i>

886
00:56:09,832 --> 00:56:14,064
<i>[Laroux] Without my wrists, there was nothing</i>
<i>to keep my hands attached to my arms.</i>

887
00:56:14,136 --> 00:56:18,869
So, even though my hands were fine,
l- I lost them too.

888
00:56:18,941 --> 00:56:23,503
Now, Brendan may not have had as many
hands and legs as the other boys...

889

<i>but there was one dream</i>
<i>he didn't let go of-</i>

890

<i>becoming a professional</i>
<i>hockey player.</i>

891
00:56:30,386 --> 00:56:33,253
<i>At first, the other players</i>
<i>treated him fairly.</i>

892

<i>But after seeing all the attention that</i>
<i>Brendan was getting, they became jealous.</i>

<i>toughed it out in the minors for two brutal years.</i>
