1
00:00:08,878 --> 00:00:11,353
B

2
00:00:12,966 --> 00:00:15,579
A

3
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:17,415
Are you having fun,
sweetheart?

4
00:00:17,416 --> 00:00:19,134
Yes

5
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:24,667
I hope you're doing better
than me, baby,

6
00:00:24,668 --> 00:00:27,577
what are you making?
- Necklace for mom.

7
00:00:27,578 --> 00:00:32,895
Yeah? Let me see.
Wow. Another one?

8
00:00:32,896 --> 00:00:34,004
Yes

9
00:00:34,005 --> 00:00:37,207
Honey...
- That's two today.

10
00:00:37,208 --> 00:00:39,150
Yeah
- Yeah?

11
00:00:39,151 --> 00:00:40,930
Honey!
Yeah

12
00:00:40,931 --> 00:00:42,974
Are you gonna help me
get that?

13
00:00:42,975 --> 00:00:45,828
I thought you and I
had a day off

14
00:00:48,059 --> 00:00:51,380
Go wash up for dinner, pumpkin.
- Okay.

15
00:00:51,381 --> 00:00:54,676
Mmm, smells nice.
Is that take-out?

16
00:00:54,677 --> 00:00:56,011
Mommy, mommy

17
00:01:05,339 --> 00:01:06,845
No!

18
00:01:07,317 --> 00:01:09,735
No, noo.

19
00:01:15,633 --> 00:01:17,619
Noo Noo!

20
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:20,121
You can't fight faith.

21
00:01:31,479 --> 00:01:32,817
We gotta get the fuck
out of her.

22
00:01:32,818 --> 00:01:34,622
What are you doing?
Come on!

23
00:01:42,194 --> 00:01:44,170
Fucking stop!
Let's go!

24
00:01:44,171 --> 00:01:46,541
Shut the fuck up!

25
00:01:59,631 --> 00:02:01,435
It's cool.

26
00:02:02,287 --> 00:02:04,372
Kids like me.

27
00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:31,915
"Law abiding Citizen"

28
00:02:31,915 --> 00:02:35,525
Transcribed by: anreith.
For inSanos

29
00:02:58,764 --> 00:03:01,383
Nick.
Bringham, what's happening?

30
00:03:01,384 --> 00:03:03,503
Willis is a rowing
buddy of mine

31
00:03:03,504 --> 00:03:05,069
Where are we on his
kids case?

32
00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:06,029
Willis?
- Yeah

33
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:07,269
Oh, I kicked that
down the tube.

34
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:08,270
Now why did you do that?

35
00:03:08,271 --> 00:03:09,107
Because the case
was a dog

36
00:03:09,108 --> 00:03:10,277
The kid was only 15
years old

37
00:03:10,278 --> 00:03:11,840
when he commited
the murder.

38
00:03:11,841 --> 00:03:13,475
So you didn't want to
jeapordize your

39
00:03:13,476 --> 00:03:16,004
95% conviction rate.
- It's actually 96%.

40
00:03:16,005 --> 00:03:17,647
96 now?
- Yes,

41
00:03:21,627 --> 00:03:22,908
You know, if I didn't
know any better

42
00:03:22,909 --> 00:03:24,378
I'd say you were
gunning for my job.

43
00:03:24,379 --> 00:03:26,334
You do know better,
and you know that

44
00:03:26,335 --> 00:03:28,345
I'm aiming much
higher than that.

45
00:03:29,243 --> 00:03:31,372
They filed a motion
to dismiss, but

46
00:03:31,373 --> 00:03:32,822
there's no way that
judge Abrams honors it.

47
00:03:32,823 --> 00:03:34,594
I think that we can
get him on RICO

48
00:03:34,595 --> 00:03:37,323
All that time and that's
what you come back with, Sarah?

49
00:03:37,324 --> 00:03:40,192
You might wanna re-evaluate
your research skills,

50
00:03:40,193 --> 00:03:42,683
what else have we got?
- She's right

51
00:03:42,684 --> 00:03:45,012
Mr Rice?
- RICO's designed for this

52
00:03:45,013 --> 00:03:47,757
check out section 901 of the
organized crime control act

53
00:03:47,758 --> 00:03:50,146
and you should let
Sarah try this case, too.

54
00:03:50,147 --> 00:03:53,430
Mr Rice, last I checked
I was running this room.

55
00:03:53,431 --> 00:03:55,784
She's already done the leg
work. I'll oversee it,

56
00:03:55,785 --> 00:03:58,098
Helen Keller could
try this case.

57
00:03:59,679 --> 00:04:02,683
Okay boy-wonder, she
fucks up it's on you.

58
00:04:02,684 --> 00:04:03,684
(DONT FUCK IT UP)

59
00:04:06,903 --> 00:04:08,073
"Thank you"

60
00:04:09,242 --> 00:04:11,840
Cantrell wants to see you
- Alright, I'll be right there.

61
00:04:11,841 --> 00:04:15,830
No. Nick.
He wants to see Nick.

62
00:04:16,936 --> 00:04:18,307
You're still torturing
Bringham?

63
00:04:18,308 --> 00:04:19,531
Let's just say I'm less
impressed with his

64
00:04:19,532 --> 00:04:20,916
Harvard degree than he is.

65
00:04:20,917 --> 00:04:21,917
We can't all have gone
to Fordham.

66
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:23,552
I went to Fordham
night school.

67
00:04:23,553 --> 00:04:25,745
You know what I learned
at Fordham night school?

68
00:04:25,746 --> 00:04:27,622
It's that law schools have
nothing to do with law.

69
00:04:27,623 --> 00:04:29,472
Guess you skipped the course
on inter-office politics.

70
00:04:29,473 --> 00:04:33,964
All I need is a jury to like me,
isn't that what you told me?

71
00:04:33,965 --> 00:04:35,317
The Shelton case,
where are we?

72
00:04:35,318 --> 00:04:39,179
It went sideways last night.
Judge Birch.

73
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:41,940
Bad news. What now?

74
00:04:41,941 --> 00:04:42,843
Let's make the deal.

75
00:04:42,844 --> 00:04:44,579
They killed a little girl, Nick.

76
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:47,059
It's an imperfect system.
- And we it's imperfect servants.

77
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:48,883
However, you could win this case.

78
00:04:48,884 --> 00:04:51,056
Can't take that chance.

79
00:04:51,057 --> 00:04:54,512
Some justice is better than
no justice at all.

80
00:04:54,513 --> 00:04:58,214
You need to tell the husband.
- It's part of my job.

81
00:04:58,215 --> 00:05:01,893
Good. Because he is waiting for
you right now.

82
00:05:01,894 --> 00:05:03,118
What?

83
00:05:05,618 --> 00:05:09,020
Do you trust me?

84
00:05:10,634 --> 00:05:13,080
Do you trust me, Clyde?

85
00:05:14,266 --> 00:05:15,788
Yeah, of course.

86
00:05:18,152 --> 00:05:21,825
Darby has agreed to
testify against Ames.

87
00:05:21,826 --> 00:05:26,873
With Darbys testimony,
Ames will go to death row.

88
00:05:31,173 --> 00:05:34,747
What about, what about
Darby then?

89
00:05:34,748 --> 00:05:37,036
Darby will plead guilty
to murder.

90
00:05:38,259 --> 00:05:41,975
In what degree?
- Third.

91
00:05:41,976 --> 00:05:44,164
He serves, what, 5 years?

92
00:05:44,165 --> 00:05:46,813
At best.

93
00:05:46,814 --> 00:05:49,131
I dont understand,
I'm sorry.

94
00:05:49,132 --> 00:05:51,335
We had a setback, Clyde.
The judge ruled that

95
00:05:51,336 --> 00:05:54,648
the DNA was inadmissable.
- What?

96
00:05:54,649 --> 00:05:56,295
Exclusionary rule.

97
00:05:56,296 --> 00:05:58,541
The oposing council maneuvered.

98
00:05:58,542 --> 00:06:00,654
You said this part of the case
was clear cut

99
00:06:00,655 --> 00:06:03,984
We had the blood on his shirt,
- It's covered under the same rule

100
00:06:03,985 --> 00:06:05,878
What about the rest
of the forensic evidence?

101
00:06:05,879 --> 00:06:10,222
It's not conclusive, Clyde.

102
00:06:11,334 --> 00:06:14,938
Okay, thats okay. Because I saw,
I saw their faces

103
00:06:14,939 --> 00:06:17,682
I saw them do it. I mean
they killed my little girl, Nick.

104
00:06:17,683 --> 00:06:21,199
You blacked out, Clyde. Your
testimony won't be reliable.

105
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:24,183
you get on the stand and
the defense will tear you apart.

106
00:06:24,184 --> 00:06:26,355
No no, the jury is going
to believe me, though,

107
00:06:26,356 --> 00:06:28,137
because its the truth.
We can win

108
00:06:28,138 --> 00:06:33,129
We can lose. And then
we have nothing.

109
00:06:33,130 --> 00:06:34,307
You would have wasted
a whole year,

110
00:06:34,308 --> 00:06:36,577
spent millions of dollars,
and then both of them

111
00:06:36,578 --> 00:06:37,812
can end up going free.

112
00:06:37,813 --> 00:06:41,816
Both of them are guilty,
especially Darby. You know that.

113
00:06:41,817 --> 00:06:46,897
It's not what you know, Clyde,
its what you can prove in court.

114
00:06:49,912 --> 00:06:51,833
Please dont make
a deal with them.

115
00:06:51,834 --> 00:06:55,502
Please don't make a deal
- I'm sorry, the deal is done.

116
00:06:55,503 --> 00:06:57,368
I'm sorry.

117
00:06:57,369 --> 00:07:01,157
I made the deal.
- What?

118
00:07:01,158 --> 00:07:02,102
How could you do that?

119
00:07:02,103 --> 00:07:05,371
This is just how the
justice system works.

120
00:07:06,623 --> 00:07:10,529
Listen, I know you don't
think it right now,

121
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:15,051
but this is a victory
for us.

122
00:07:16,773 --> 00:07:19,588
Your office has certified
this agreement?

123
00:07:19,589 --> 00:07:21,736
Yes, your honor.
- Mr Reynolds?

124
00:07:21,737 --> 00:07:25,074
Any great insights to share
with the court today?

125
00:07:25,075 --> 00:07:27,513
No, your honor.
No insights.

126
00:07:27,514 --> 00:07:29,076
Good, then I trust that
we can move forward

127
00:07:29,077 --> 00:07:32,385
with Mr Ames' trial
unimpeded by delays

128
00:07:32,386 --> 00:07:35,002
a trial date is imminent.

129
00:07:38,859 --> 00:07:41,564
There's no cell phones
in my courtroom, mr Rice.

130
00:07:41,565 --> 00:07:44,700
We've been over this.
- I'm sorry.

131
00:07:44,701 --> 00:07:47,766
I had some exigent
business I was...

132
00:07:47,767 --> 00:07:49,767
Next time it's mine.

133
00:07:53,336 --> 00:07:56,244
Ahh, you married?
- Excuse me?

134
00:07:56,245 --> 00:07:58,575
Are you married?

135
00:07:59,648 --> 00:08:04,325
Please fuck this up.
So I can destroy you.

136
00:08:09,361 --> 00:08:12,422
I wish ill for no man
but Ames deserves

137
00:08:12,423 --> 00:08:14,946
to suffer for what he did.

138
00:08:14,947 --> 00:08:19,046
I mean you cant
fight faith, right?

139
00:08:24,408 --> 00:08:25,824
Nick.

140
00:08:25,825 --> 00:08:28,067
Once you make a decision,
live with it. Move on.

141
00:08:28,068 --> 00:08:31,033
In this job your best
asset is a short memory.

142
00:08:31,034 --> 00:08:33,025
Don't beat yourself up,
too many other people

143
00:08:33,026 --> 00:08:34,316
out there doing that
already. Look,

144
00:08:34,317 --> 00:08:36,138
there's some of them
right now.

145
00:08:36,139 --> 00:08:41,377
Isn't this when you tell
me some old favel, wise tale...

146
00:08:41,378 --> 00:08:43,465
Alright, alright. I got one.

147
00:08:43,466 --> 00:08:45,478
Marcus Aurelius had a
servant walk behind him

148
00:08:45,479 --> 00:08:47,541
as he made his way to
the roman time square.

149
00:08:47,542 --> 00:08:50,809
And the servants only job
was to whisper in his ear

150
00:08:50,810 --> 00:08:53,897
when people praised him:
"You're only a man"

151
00:08:53,898 --> 00:08:56,989
"You're only a man"
Okay, man?

152
00:08:57,748 --> 00:08:59,353
That's some bullshit.
- That's good

153
00:08:59,354 --> 00:09:00,978
I don't even think you
know the story, man.

154
00:09:00,979 --> 00:09:02,858
You're missing the point,
Nick, it doesnt matter

155
00:09:02,859 --> 00:09:06,547
what they say.
- Okay. I got this now.

156
00:09:09,404 --> 00:09:11,267
One at a time.
One at a time.

157
00:09:11,268 --> 00:09:12,865
So you'll be seeking the
death penalty?

158
00:09:12,866 --> 00:09:14,897
For Rupert Ames we will be.
- And for Darby?

159
00:09:14,898 --> 00:09:17,997
He has pled guilty to murder
but he is a cooperating witness.

160
00:09:17,998 --> 00:09:20,491
The DAs office has commited
all of its resources

161
00:09:20,492 --> 00:09:22,989
to ensure that
justice will be served.

162
00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:23,990
Did you make any kind of...

163
00:09:30,379 --> 00:09:33,812
I just wanna say thanks
for being in my corner.

164
00:09:33,813 --> 00:09:36,991
It's nice when the
system works, right?

165
00:09:36,992 --> 00:09:38,761
Get away from me.

166
00:09:38,762 --> 00:09:39,762
Come on. Move it.

167
00:09:54,762 --> 00:09:56,937
Let's go.

168
00:10:24,778 --> 00:10:27,306
Uh-uh, what happened?
- What happened where?

169
00:10:30,283 --> 00:10:31,718
What's wrong?

170
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:35,331
And you call my job boring.

171
00:10:35,332 --> 00:10:37,645
C minus?
- Yes

172
00:10:39,649 --> 00:10:42,157
Well, okay, now,

173
00:10:42,158 --> 00:10:44,251
You gonna tell me
whats wrong?

174
00:10:44,252 --> 00:10:49,393
Can I talk to my daughter
for a little bit?

175
00:10:50,345 --> 00:10:53,757
Nooo...
- Please

176
00:10:53,758 --> 00:10:55,774
First of all, this is your
father speaking

177
00:10:55,775 --> 00:10:58,035
Yeah, she didnt know that.
- You never know.

178
00:10:58,036 --> 00:11:01,121
I want you to stay in there
as long as you can

179
00:11:01,122 --> 00:11:03,812
Cause there's a lot of crazy
ass people out here.

180
00:11:03,813 --> 00:11:08,454
Language!
- Your mother is a hardass.

181
00:11:08,455 --> 00:11:09,958
I'm right here.

182
00:11:09,959 --> 00:11:13,498
And daddy wants you to come
out and be daddys little girl...

183
00:11:17,927 --> 00:11:19,115
<i>10 years later

184
00:11:19,878 --> 00:11:22,439
Anybody seen my phone?

185
00:11:26,289 --> 00:11:28,412
Hey, did you see
my phone?

186
00:11:28,413 --> 00:11:29,652
It's not strapped
to your hand?

187
00:11:29,653 --> 00:11:31,777
No it's not strapped
to my hand.

188
00:11:31,778 --> 00:11:35,337
Daddy! Not gonna have
some of my french toast?

189
00:11:35,338 --> 00:11:37,782
French toast, you making
french toast?

190
00:11:37,783 --> 00:11:40,052
I'm sorry I can't,
I'm running late.

191
00:11:40,053 --> 00:11:42,079
Okay.

192
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:46,515
Alright, here we go.
Mmmm, taste good.

193
00:11:46,516 --> 00:11:48,058
Thanks
- Did this is by yourself?

194
00:11:48,059 --> 00:11:49,067
You're better than
your mother.

195
00:11:49,068 --> 00:11:53,093
I heard that. Smells good.
Here, your lifeline.

196
00:11:53,094 --> 00:11:54,979
Morning baby.

197
00:11:56,597 --> 00:12:00,084
You're going to your daughters
recital this afternoon?

198
00:12:00,085 --> 00:12:03,615
Uhm, I thought you were
gonna order the DVDs.

199
00:12:03,616 --> 00:12:05,356
Video is not the same, Nick.

200
00:12:05,357 --> 00:12:08,097
Mom, its okay. Dad's gotta
work, I know

201
00:12:08,098 --> 00:12:11,294
See, its alright. Dad's gotta work.
And what does Dad do?

202
00:12:11,295 --> 00:12:13,114
Lock up bad guys.
- And why does he do that?

203
00:12:13,115 --> 00:12:16,146
To keep us safe.
- Yeah, he wants us to be safe.

204
00:12:16,147 --> 00:12:18,555
Baby, get your chello.
- Alright

205
00:12:18,556 --> 00:12:20,840
Thank you so much.
- You're welcome.

206
00:12:20,841 --> 00:12:23,775
What a Julia Child (cook).
- Mmhhmm

207
00:12:24,936 --> 00:12:27,370
You know she's 10
years old, right?

208
00:12:27,371 --> 00:12:28,313
you know that?
- I know that

209
00:12:28,314 --> 00:12:30,026
She doesn't understand why
you're never around.

210
00:12:30,027 --> 00:12:34,005
This good-guy-bad-guy
stuff thats just talk to her.

211
00:12:34,006 --> 00:12:35,935
I can't come today.

212
00:12:35,936 --> 00:12:39,586
You know you have not
been to one recital

213
00:12:39,587 --> 00:12:41,559
Enough!
- Okay

214
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:47,513
We'll get the video, we'll sit
down and watch as a family.

215
00:12:47,514 --> 00:12:50,663
I love you. Alright?

216
00:12:50,664 --> 00:12:52,724
Thank you for the toast.
- Love you

217
00:12:52,725 --> 00:12:54,851
Love you too
- Bye

218
00:12:58,251 --> 00:13:01,385
So how's Chip?
- It's Chester

219
00:13:01,386 --> 00:13:02,525
What happened to Chip,
I liked Chip.

220
00:13:02,526 --> 00:13:05,993
There is no Chip. And now
there's no Chester.

221
00:13:05,994 --> 00:13:08,061
He kept calling.
- Sarah, thats a good thing.

222
00:13:08,062 --> 00:13:11,776
I know, but I kept cancelling.
My case load is crazy.

223
00:13:11,777 --> 00:13:14,314
You know you dont have to
go to this if you dont want to.

224
00:13:14,315 --> 00:13:18,543
Yeah, I do. I...
What's it like?

225
00:13:18,544 --> 00:13:20,877
No biggie. Like watching
somebody fall asleep.

226
00:13:20,878 --> 00:13:24,977
Except the not-waking-up part?
Does it bother you?

227
00:13:24,978 --> 00:13:27,236
Not anymore.

228
00:14:03,277 --> 00:14:07,001
Sarah. Your legs are looking
real good in those heels.

229
00:14:07,002 --> 00:14:08,227
What are you doing, Reynolds?

230
00:14:08,228 --> 00:14:10,106
Why are you here? Your
DVD player is broken?

231
00:14:09,507 --> 00:14:14,285
Ames has no family. I felt like
someone should be here for him.

232
00:14:14,286 --> 00:14:16,722
You just getting a little press?

233
00:14:20,116 --> 00:14:22,225
Breathe.

234
00:14:35,004 --> 00:14:39,066
What I did out
there was wrong.

235
00:14:39,067 --> 00:14:43,426
I should have never
been there.

236
00:14:43,427 --> 00:14:49,888
But I swear to God,
I didn't kill those people.

237
00:14:51,281 --> 00:14:54,796
Wrong man is dying
here today.

238
00:14:55,679 --> 00:14:56,728
That's all.

239
00:16:25,455 --> 00:16:27,857
Oh God.
- Take her away.

240
00:16:27,858 --> 00:16:30,311
What the hell is going on?
- I dont know.

241
00:16:50,864 --> 00:16:54,423
Are you okay?
- Yeah

242
00:16:56,535 --> 00:16:59,118
So, somebody killed the guy
you were trying to kill.

243
00:16:59,119 --> 00:16:59,775
What are we calling this?

244
00:16:59,776 --> 00:17:01,853
Clear violation of his 8th
amendment right:

245
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:03,211
cruel and unusual
punishment.

246
00:17:03,212 --> 00:17:04,717
Law school.
- Yeah. The machine,

247
00:17:04,718 --> 00:17:06,429
how does it work
on a good day?

248
00:17:06,430 --> 00:17:09,132
It's designed to
be pain free.

249
00:17:09,133 --> 00:17:11,600
Three drugs, administered
in a specific order.

250
00:17:11,601 --> 00:17:13,921
From this moment on we
are assuming that

251
00:17:13,922 --> 00:17:15,042
the machine was corrupted.

252
00:17:15,043 --> 00:17:16,384
We're gonna need
a list of all the people

253
00:17:16,385 --> 00:17:18,090
with access to
that machine.

254
00:17:18,091 --> 00:17:20,009
My people would
not do this.

255
00:17:20,010 --> 00:17:21,395
I appreciate that, Warden, but

256
00:17:21,396 --> 00:17:24,850
I'm gonna need more than
a hallpass and a note from mom.

257
00:17:24,851 --> 00:17:27,638
Detectives. Got something
back on the machine.

258
00:17:27,639 --> 00:17:31,377
Let me see that?
- Right there.

259
00:17:31,378 --> 00:17:35,159
"Cant fight faith".
- What is it, Nick?

260
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:37,638
During the home invasion
Ames accomplice said

261
00:17:37,639 --> 00:17:40,054
to one of the victims:
"Can't fight faith"

262
00:17:40,055 --> 00:17:44,038
He said the same thing to me
in the courtroom, the prick.

263
00:17:44,039 --> 00:17:46,209
I can't remember his name.

264
00:17:46,487 --> 00:17:48,410
Have a look at this.
Your guy?

265
00:17:48,411 --> 00:17:51,181
Clarence James Darby
- He's a beauty...

266
00:17:51,182 --> 00:17:53,480
You got history with him?
- I put him away.

267
00:17:53,481 --> 00:17:55,750
Ah, 3 years. Is that the going
rate for murder these days?

268
00:17:55,751 --> 00:17:58,056
There was extenuating
circumstances.

269
00:17:58,057 --> 00:18:01,688
The only extenuating circumstance
should be if he didnt do it.

270
00:18:01,689 --> 00:18:04,141
Still, three years at Marion,
fucking gladiator camp,

271
00:18:04,142 --> 00:18:06,003
you expect him to come
back a model citizen?

272
00:18:06,004 --> 00:18:08,578
Well, if you scholars wouldnt
contaminate the crime scenes,

273
00:18:08,579 --> 00:18:10,516
I could keep them locked
up longer.

274
00:18:10,517 --> 00:18:12,614
<i>Authorities have refused to
comment at this point

275
00:18:12,615 --> 00:18:15,848
<i>foul play cannot be ruled out.
The prisoner had been on death row

00:18:18,775 --> 00:18:21,619

279

280
00:18:32,891 --> 00:18:35,141
Yeah?
- Clarence Darby?

281
00:18:35,142 --> 00:18:38,180
Who's this?
- That's strike three for you,

282
00:18:38,181 --> 00:18:44,099
Coke on the table, bitch on the floor.
Away from prison.

283
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:45,696
Who the fuck is this?

284
00:18:45,697 --> 00:18:48,539
Look out your window.
South side.

285
00:18:50,328 --> 00:18:53,382
Is this a joke?
Get up.

286
00:18:53,383 --> 00:18:55,636
South side.

287
00:18:58,243 --> 00:19:02,754
Motherfucker.
Shit.

288
00:19:02,755 --> 00:19:04,413
Out of the way!

289
00:19:18,368 --> 00:19:21,494
He's outdoor!
Go. Go

290
00:19:21,495 --> 00:19:23,680
Damn.
- Move it, move it.

291
00:19:32,832 --> 00:19:33,942
What now?

292
00:19:33,943 --> 00:19:36,152
Wipe the prints off the gun.
Get rid of it.

293
00:19:36,153 --> 00:19:39,764
No, no, no
- You fired six times, genius

294
00:19:39,765 --> 00:19:42,007
You bring any ammunition?
Lose it.

295
00:19:42,008 --> 00:19:45,264
Why are you doing this?
- I wanna keep you out of prison.

296
00:19:45,265 --> 00:19:47,926
See the abandoned factories?
Go toward them.

297
00:19:47,927 --> 00:19:50,761
Why?
There's a cop car there.

298
00:19:50,762 --> 00:19:52,372
With a cop in it.
What the fuck!

299
00:19:52,373 --> 00:19:53,584
I tazered him, but
he will be waking

300
00:19:53,585 --> 00:19:57,523
up in under 90 seconds.
So better move.

301
00:20:14,198 --> 00:20:16,211
Rise and fucking shine, bitch

302
00:20:16,212 --> 00:20:20,049
Wake the fuck up.
Let's go. Start the fucking car.

303
00:20:20,050 --> 00:20:24,707
Okay. Take it easy.
- Do it. Come on.

304
00:20:24,708 --> 00:20:26,709
Take it easy.
Lets go, lets go!

305
00:20:26,710 --> 00:20:30,048
Get it in gear, shithead. Now!
Do it!

306
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:48,895
Get the fuck out.

307
00:20:54,496 --> 00:20:55,480
Lets go.

308
00:20:57,267 --> 00:20:58,507
Get the fuck down there.

309
00:20:58,508 --> 00:21:03,428
Hey. What about my
wife, my little girl?

310
00:21:03,429 --> 00:21:06,472
I'll never see them again.
- Fucked up, man.

311
00:21:06,473 --> 00:21:11,662
Ohh, oh oh, you don't mind
if I take this, do you?

312
00:21:11,663 --> 00:21:16,519
My guardian angel.
I am impressed.

313
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:21,078
You know why I'll never see
my wife and little girl again?

314
00:21:21,079 --> 00:21:22,079
What the...?

315
00:21:25,032 --> 00:21:27,399
Cause you took them from me.

316
00:21:34,585 --> 00:21:36,590
Remember me?

317
00:21:38,467 --> 00:21:40,680
Sure you do.

318
00:21:40,681 --> 00:21:43,593
You came over to my house
once before.

319
00:21:43,594 --> 00:21:45,175
Don't remember?

320
00:21:47,411 --> 00:21:55,551
This Tetrodotoxin should be nicely
in your system by now.

321
00:21:55,552 --> 00:21:59,764
Isolated from the liver of
the Carribean Puffer Fish.

322
00:21:59,765 --> 00:22:03,293
So, it paralyzes you,

323
00:22:03,294 --> 00:22:08,458
but leaves all the other
neurological functions intact.

324
00:22:08,459 --> 00:22:16,586
In other words, you cant move,
but you feel everything.

325
00:22:16,587 --> 00:22:20,819
It does absolutely nothing
to blunt the pain.

326
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:23,483
And you're about to
experience more of that

327
00:22:23,484 --> 00:22:26,296
than you can ever
fucking imagine.

328
00:22:36,412 --> 00:22:39,698
???, so you dont bleed out.

329
00:22:39,699 --> 00:22:41,822
You may be here a while.

330
00:22:42,321 --> 00:22:46,453
Saline solution, that should
keep us going.

331
00:22:47,061 --> 00:22:51,741
The clamps, nice and secure.

332
00:22:53,619 --> 00:22:55,278
Comfortable?

333
00:22:56,047 --> 00:23:01,859
You really are shaking.
Sure you're alright?

334
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:03,566
You'll love this.

335
00:23:04,885 --> 00:23:06,625
Adrenalin.

336
00:23:07,397 --> 00:23:11,952
Now this, is so you
don't pass out.

337
00:23:13,966 --> 00:23:18,689
There you go.
Good.

338
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:23,046
Now what we dont want,
is you swallowing your tongue

339
00:23:23,047 --> 00:23:25,737
so bare with me.

340
00:23:31,957 --> 00:23:36,390
Now this is for your penis.
But we'll get to that later.

341
00:23:37,837 --> 00:23:42,200
Scalpel, for your eyelids.

342
00:23:42,201 --> 00:23:46,081
In case you insist on
fucking shutting them.

343
00:23:47,167 --> 00:23:53,333
You see, I know what it
feels like to be helpless,

344
00:23:53,334 --> 00:23:58,087
just like when I watched you
slaughter my whole family.

345
00:23:59,339 --> 00:24:03,923
You can't fight faith,
right Darby?

346
00:24:05,198 --> 00:24:07,495
Oh! And look.

347
00:24:07,496 --> 00:24:11,273
I made this especially for you.

348
00:24:13,864 --> 00:24:18,747
You like it? Yeah, I didn't want
you to miss anything.

349
00:24:18,748 --> 00:24:23,014
Now you have the best
view in the house.

350
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:29,249
You hear that? Your heart
is beating so fast.

351
00:24:30,904 --> 00:24:34,926
Well, me too. Okay.

352
00:24:37,564 --> 00:24:40,850
Now they get to watch
you suffer.

353
00:24:43,017 --> 00:24:45,948
They'll be the last thing
you ever see.

354
00:24:45,949 --> 00:24:50,067
as I cut off every single one
of your fucking limbs.

355
00:24:50,068 --> 00:24:51,990
See, I wasn't lying,

356
00:24:53,071 --> 00:24:57,743
when I told you I wanted
to keep you out of prison.

357
00:24:59,773 --> 00:25:01,436
That was the truth.

358
00:25:32,762 --> 00:25:35,218
Thanks for the car.

359
00:26:00,442 --> 00:26:03,253
Okay, these are all the
case files on Darby,

360
00:26:03,254 --> 00:26:05,943
I vetted through what I could,
we have crime scene photos...

361
00:26:05,944 --> 00:26:07,640
Don't want to see them.

362
00:26:09,127 --> 00:26:10,465
Okay

363
00:26:16,689 --> 00:26:19,833
What's bothering you?
- It's Darby

364
00:26:19,834 --> 00:26:22,322
All the crimes he's committed
have one thing in common,

365
00:26:22,323 --> 00:26:25,524
there was violence, but the
execution wasnt violence,

366
00:26:25,525 --> 00:26:30,490
that was, that was intellect.
- Okay.

367
00:26:30,491 --> 00:26:32,107
What are you thinking?

368
00:26:33,627 --> 00:26:37,071
Was just thinking maybe we
shouldn't be looking at Darby.

369
00:26:47,163 --> 00:26:49,375
Jesus Christ.

370
00:26:55,324 --> 00:26:57,837
Rice.
- Good news, councellor.

371
00:26:57,838 --> 00:26:59,380
Found Darby.

372
00:26:59,823 --> 00:27:02,769
I gotta say though,
he's looked better.

373
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:07,608
They found him in about
25 pieces; no legs

374
00:27:07,609 --> 00:27:10,085
no arms, eyelids were
sliced off. Gruesome.

375
00:27:10,086 --> 00:27:12,026
Shedding tears for Darby?
- Not quite

376
00:27:12,027 --> 00:27:15,666
So your wheel's turning.
- Think motive. Who has it?

377
00:27:15,667 --> 00:27:17,878
The husband. Father. What
do we know about him?

378
00:27:17,879 --> 00:27:19,879
He owned the warehouse
where they found Darby

379
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:21,909
What else?
- He's a tinkerer,

380
00:27:21,910 --> 00:27:25,777
little inventionist. Gizmos.
He holds two dozen patents,

381
00:27:25,778 --> 00:27:29,024
that made him some money.
He liquidated most of his wealth

382
00:27:29,025 --> 00:27:32,792
a few years ago, to buy some
industrial properties

383
00:27:32,793 --> 00:27:35,933
around airports, chemical
plants, railyards.

384
00:27:35,934 --> 00:27:38,747
It doesn't add up.
- No, it's weird, right?

385
00:27:38,748 --> 00:27:40,356
Search them all, Sarah,
see what you find.

386
00:28:57,824 --> 00:28:59,582
Down on your knees!

387
00:29:00,626 --> 00:29:02,722
Get down! Go! Knees!

388
00:29:03,731 --> 00:29:05,165
Face down! face down!

389
00:29:12,132 --> 00:29:12,993
"DADDY"

390
00:29:42,793 --> 00:29:45,119
The crazy ones scare
the shit out of me.

391
00:29:45,763 --> 00:29:47,969
Is this guy a lawyer?

392
00:29:48,257 --> 00:29:49,257
No.

393
00:29:51,245 --> 00:29:54,568
He's an engineer.
"United States Code Annotated"

394
00:29:54,268 --> 00:29:56,596
Nick, look at this.

395
00:30:02,279 --> 00:30:05,473
"Prosecutor Calls Death
Penalty For Ames"

396
00:30:34,134 --> 00:30:36,836
We have zero evidence.
You better get a confession.

397
00:30:36,837 --> 00:30:38,442
Did he give you any
trouble on the way in?

398
00:30:38,443 --> 00:30:40,302
No. Nothing.

399
00:30:40,303 --> 00:30:43,702
He wasn's too happy when
we took his bracelet though.

400
00:30:52,445 --> 00:30:54,951
Can I help you?
- Package for the Rice family.

401
00:30:54,952 --> 00:30:57,639
Oh yeah. Thanks.

402
00:30:59,249 --> 00:31:01,044
Mom, the video from
my recital came.

403
00:31:01,045 --> 00:31:04,550
Can we watch it? Please?

404
00:31:04,551 --> 00:31:05,984
No, not you.
No.

405
00:31:05,985 --> 00:31:08,295
Denise, we said we would
wait for your father, remember?

406
00:31:07,996 --> 00:31:10,906
Please?
- No, not now.

407
00:31:14,007 --> 00:31:15,180
Uhum. Yes

408
00:31:40,251 --> 00:31:41,352
Mommy

409
00:31:57,215 --> 00:31:58,924
Don't worry, he's just
disarming the guy.

410
00:31:58,925 --> 00:32:00,652
Letting him feel easy.

411
00:32:00,648 --> 00:32:04,752
What I'm about to tell you
I dont want anyone to hear.

412
00:32:05,336 --> 00:32:07,960
As a prosecutor Im breaking
all the rules right now,

413
00:32:07,961 --> 00:32:10,850
and I dont give a damn.
Because Im a father,

414
00:32:10,851 --> 00:32:14,265
I have a little girl.
And what you did

415
00:32:15,153 --> 00:32:16,739
Bravo.

416
00:32:19,064 --> 00:32:23,342
The world is better
without Darby and Ames.

417
00:32:23,343 --> 00:32:25,776
You're not gonna see a tear
shed from me or anybody

418
00:32:25,777 --> 00:32:27,634
in my office.

419
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:37,123
With that being said,
I have a job to do.

420
00:32:39,705 --> 00:32:42,220
I want to ask you some very
simple and direct questions,

421
00:32:42,221 --> 00:32:46,227
I suggest that you answer
them in the same fashion.

422
00:32:46,228 --> 00:32:49,127
Is your name Clyde
Alexander Sheldon?

423
00:32:49,128 --> 00:32:50,327
Yes, Sir.

424
00:32:50,328 --> 00:32:52,471
And you wave your right
to councel, correct?

425
00:32:52,472 --> 00:32:53,120
Yes, Sir.

426
00:32:53,121 --> 00:32:55,421
You sure you wanna do that?

427
00:32:56,441 --> 00:32:57,626
Yes.

428
00:32:58,189 --> 00:33:01,313
Did you murder
Clarence Darby?

429
00:33:02,636 --> 00:33:07,715
I wanted him dead.
He killed my wife and child.

430
00:33:07,716 --> 00:33:11,935
Rupert Ames, did you
murder him aswell?

431
00:33:11,936 --> 00:33:14,707
Rupert Ames deserved to die.

432
00:33:14,708 --> 00:33:16,859
They both deserved to die.

433
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:21,876
So, you arranged both
of those murders?

434
00:33:21,877 --> 00:33:24,585
Yes, I planned it,
in my head,

435
00:33:24,586 --> 00:33:28,222
over and over again,
took me a long time.

436
00:33:30,655 --> 00:33:35,280
Alright. I guess
we are done here.

437
00:33:35,737 --> 00:33:37,541
Councelor.

438
00:33:39,104 --> 00:33:43,245
You might want to cancel your
12:30 lunch with judge Roberts.

439
00:33:43,246 --> 00:33:45,455
Excuse me?

440
00:33:45,456 --> 00:33:47,765
In fact, you might want to
cancel the rest of the week

441
00:33:47,764 --> 00:33:50,658
cause you're gonna
be busy. Sit down.

442
00:33:52,710 --> 00:33:56,080
We're done here.
We have your confession.

443
00:33:56,719 --> 00:33:59,207
Oh, you do?
- And on tape.

444
00:33:59,208 --> 00:34:02,434
See, in our profession we
consider that a "slam dunk"

445
00:34:02,435 --> 00:34:05,361
Oh, really? I dont think so.
Lets think back.

446
00:34:05,362 --> 00:34:07,499
What did I say?

447
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:10,457
That I wanted to kill
Clarence Darby?

448
00:34:10,458 --> 00:34:12,575
Yeah, sure, what
father wouldn't?

449
00:34:13,214 --> 00:34:15,596
That Darby and Ames
deserved to die?

450
00:34:15,597 --> 00:34:17,696
I think most people
would agree with that.

451
00:34:17,697 --> 00:34:19,197
That I planned it over
and over again,

452
00:34:19,198 --> 00:34:22,098
in my head?
Yeah.

453
00:34:22,099 --> 00:34:24,361
Who wouldnt fantasize
about that?

454
00:34:24,362 --> 00:34:27,500
None of these are an
admission of guilt, Nick.

455
00:34:27,501 --> 00:34:28,798
You might wanna
check the tape.

456
00:34:28,799 --> 00:34:31,203
We know you did it.
- Well it's not what you know,

457
00:34:31,204 --> 00:34:33,441
it's what you can
prove in court.

458
00:34:33,442 --> 00:34:34,919
Didn't you tell me
that once?

459
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:37,278
The only problem with your
theory is that Darby's

460
00:34:37,279 --> 00:34:38,782
body was found on
your property.

461
00:34:38,783 --> 00:34:40,035
One of my many properties.

462
00:34:40,036 --> 00:34:42,583
An old abandoned
warehouse, Nick.

463
00:34:42,584 --> 00:34:45,379
Junkies, they trespass
there all the time.

464
00:34:45,380 --> 00:34:47,480
Isn't Darby involved
in the drug trade?

465
00:34:47,481 --> 00:34:50,136
That's an unsavory world.
I bet you a jury would agree,

466
00:34:50,137 --> 00:34:54,124
or perhaps someone was
trying to frame me.

467
00:34:54,125 --> 00:34:57,105
Go ahead. There's a lot
of assholes in prison

468
00:34:57,105 --> 00:34:58,907
that thought they were
smarter than me.

469
00:34:58,908 --> 00:35:01,584
Let's stop fucking around.

470
00:35:01,585 --> 00:35:04,669
Nick, unless you have
any hard evidence,

471
00:35:04,670 --> 00:35:06,417
then why are we
even here?

472
00:35:06,418 --> 00:35:08,935
Why are we having...
- What you want?

473
00:35:11,453 --> 00:35:14,281
Well, thats easy.

474
00:35:15,034 --> 00:35:17,697
You're the one that makes
deals with murderers, yeah?

475
00:35:17,698 --> 00:35:19,769
So I've come to make mine.

476
00:35:19,770 --> 00:35:24,491
I will give you a confession,
a real confession.

477
00:35:24,492 --> 00:35:26,843
You just have to give me
something in return.

478
00:35:26,844 --> 00:35:30,695
Well, you are a murderer,
so what might that be?

479
00:35:30,696 --> 00:35:32,516
A bed.

480
00:35:35,431 --> 00:35:37,346
But a nice bed.

481
00:35:37,347 --> 00:35:40,322
I want a nice new
one for myself.

482
00:35:40,323 --> 00:35:41,385
I see.

483
00:35:41,386 --> 00:35:42,851
You're gonna have to
deal with that,

484
00:35:42,852 --> 00:35:44,429
because the one I have is
lumpy, Nick,

485
00:35:44,430 --> 00:35:46,562
it's making me crazy.

486
00:35:46,563 --> 00:35:48,883
Clyde, I think you got me
confused with the detail

487
00:35:48,884 --> 00:35:51,586
people, see I dont deal
with prison conditions.

488
00:35:51,587 --> 00:35:53,683
I believe those cots are
bolted into the cells.

489
00:35:53,684 --> 00:35:57,966
Well that's what wrenches
are for, dumbass.

490
00:35:58,717 --> 00:36:00,394
You know one of those
new Duxiana beds with

491
00:36:00,395 --> 00:36:04,030
the adjustable lumbar support

492
00:36:04,031 --> 00:36:05,290
I've seen the commercial.

493
00:36:05,291 --> 00:36:07,529
That's the one I want.
- Those are nice.

494
00:36:07,530 --> 00:36:11,338
Cause really, Nick, I dont
think I can focus on much

495
00:36:11,339 --> 00:36:14,171
of anything until I've had
a good, revitalizing nights

496
00:36:14,172 --> 00:36:17,549
sleep, in my therapeutic
Duxiana bed.

497
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:19,612
So that's the deal.

498
00:36:19,613 --> 00:36:23,478
Give me my bed, you
get your confession.

499
00:36:24,108 --> 00:36:25,750
Let me think about
that for a second.

500
00:36:25,751 --> 00:36:28,344
How about uhm...

501
00:36:28,345 --> 00:36:30,593
Fuck no?

502
00:36:40,643 --> 00:36:42,131
Hey.
- What are you doing?

503
00:36:42,132 --> 00:36:42,927
What do you mean what
am I doing?

504
00:36:42,928 --> 00:36:46,114
Why did you tell him no?
- A mattress?

505
00:36:46,115 --> 00:36:47,679
He doesn't make those
kind of decisions.

506
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:49,131
Take your ego out
of it, Nick.

507
00:36:49,132 --> 00:36:51,159
Shelton's got a point,
this case is shit,

508
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:52,784
we need a confession
and a mattress for a

509
00:36:52,785 --> 00:36:54,694
murder confession, thats
a pretty good deal

510
00:36:54,695 --> 00:36:57,328
He's playing us, Jonas.
- Well then we will play him.

511
00:36:57,329 --> 00:37:02,032
Nick. Call from the office.
You're not answering your cell.

512
00:37:02,033 --> 00:37:04,304
I need to finish up here,
and then I will be home

513
00:37:04,305 --> 00:37:07,130
as soon as I can.
- Listen to me, that video

514
00:37:07,131 --> 00:37:10,000
Nick, I have never seen
anything like it.

515
00:37:10,001 --> 00:37:11,739
Please, come home.

516
00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:13,562
Listen, you need
to calm down

517
00:37:13,563 --> 00:37:16,538
tell her its not real.
And that I love her.

518
00:37:16,539 --> 00:37:18,268
Come home. Come
home soon please.

519
00:37:18,269 --> 00:37:19,353
Kelly, did you
see his face?

520
00:37:19,354 --> 00:37:23,106
No, it was covered with
something, I couldnt see.

521
00:37:23,107 --> 00:37:25,699
let me finish up here
and I will come home.

522
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:26,700
Okay.

523
00:37:27,969 --> 00:37:30,200
This motherfucker sent
a DVD to my house,

524
00:37:30,201 --> 00:37:32,269
of him killing Darby.
- What?

525
00:37:32,270 --> 00:37:34,117
My daughter saw it.

526
00:37:36,074 --> 00:37:39,341
He recorded it, we've got him.
- No, he had on a mask

527
00:37:39,342 --> 00:37:41,361
we need that confession.

528
00:37:41,362 --> 00:37:43,388
You still want to bargain
with this man?

529
00:37:43,389 --> 00:37:47,552
The art of the possible, Warden.
Make the deal.

530
00:38:05,331 --> 00:38:09,073
Back problems, Warden.
The worst.

531
00:38:09,074 --> 00:38:11,772
You got bigger problems
than that.

532
00:38:11,773 --> 00:38:14,296
It's the have-nots
in here, son.

533
00:38:14,297 --> 00:38:18,126
They don't know that
I want to be the one have

534
00:38:21,392 --> 00:38:22,812
Turn around.

535
00:38:27,298 --> 00:38:30,325
I dont think he likes me.

536
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:33,569
Nice bed.

537
00:38:35,701 --> 00:38:40,175
Thank you.
It's a single.

538
00:38:40,989 --> 00:38:43,183
We can't put Clyde
Shelton anywhere,

539
00:38:43,184 --> 00:38:44,363
not in a job,
not in a city,

540
00:38:44,364 --> 00:38:46,420
not even a country.
So I dug a little deeper,

541
00:38:46,421 --> 00:38:48,214
and I found something
from his missing years,

542
00:38:48,215 --> 00:38:50,714
a couple of contract
payments, to Clyde,

543
00:38:50,715 --> 00:38:52,175
from the Department of Defense.

544
00:38:52,176 --> 00:38:54,853
And his real estate?
- He bought 9 properties

545
00:38:54,854 --> 00:38:56,848
under his own name, then
he transfered them to

546
00:38:56,849 --> 00:38:58,208
some corporation in Panama.

547
00:38:58,209 --> 00:39:02,022
We can't get to the adresses,
lack of reciprocity problems,

548
00:39:02,023 --> 00:39:03,563
we are gonna circle back
to the farmhouse.

549
00:39:03,564 --> 00:39:07,065
That's a waste of time.
He wanted us to find him there.

550
00:39:07,066 --> 00:39:09,690
It's the industrial stuff
thats curious.

551
00:39:09,691 --> 00:39:10,841
Alright, I dont care what
you have to do, or who

552
00:39:10,842 --> 00:39:14,678
you piss off, if we have to
invade Panama again, fine.

553
00:39:14,679 --> 00:39:16,309
Clyde is hiding those
properties for a reason.

554
00:39:16,310 --> 00:39:18,408
Find it.
- Got it.

555
00:39:30,931 --> 00:39:33,402
Baby, did you leave a crack?
- Yeah, I left a crack.

556
00:39:33,403 --> 00:39:36,660
Night light?
- Isn't she too old for that?

557
00:39:36,661 --> 00:39:39,429
Yeah, I left the night light.

558
00:39:39,430 --> 00:39:40,601
Look.

559
00:39:41,168 --> 00:39:43,428
I told her that that
video wasn't real.

560
00:39:43,429 --> 00:39:47,784
Some sort of horror film
she shouldn't be looking at.

561
00:39:47,785 --> 00:39:51,250
She'll be okay.
- And you?

562
00:39:51,251 --> 00:39:57,318
- If I'm what, okay? Of course.
Don't I look okay?

563
00:39:59,885 --> 00:40:05,756
Nick is always okay.
Always, I'm extra good.

564
00:40:06,943 --> 00:40:09,847
In light of Mr Sheltons
economic means and his,

565
00:40:09,848 --> 00:40:12,913
potential flight risk, the
egregious nature of both

566
00:40:12,914 --> 00:40:15,517
Mr Ames' and Mr Darbys deaths

567
00:40:15,518 --> 00:40:17,574
The state requestst hat bail
be denied, your honor.

568
00:40:20,238 --> 00:40:25,762
Seeing as you waved your right
to counsel, Mr Sheldon,

569
00:40:25,763 --> 00:40:31,380
do you have anything
to say? Mr Sheldon?

570
00:40:31,381 --> 00:40:34,191
Do you have anything
that you'd like to say?

571
00:40:34,192 --> 00:40:38,768
Yes, yes, your honor.
Should I stand?

572
00:40:38,769 --> 00:40:39,769
Please.

573
00:40:48,386 --> 00:40:51,609
Your honor, I'm a
law abiding citizen.

574
00:40:51,610 --> 00:40:53,878
Just a regular guy.

575
00:40:53,879 --> 00:40:56,295
I'm not a flight risk

576
00:40:56,296 --> 00:40:58,887
This is my first alleged offense,

577
00:40:58,888 --> 00:41:01,028
and the prosecution
has not presented

578
00:41:01,029 --> 00:41:04,636
one single piece of
evidence against me.

579
00:41:05,451 --> 00:41:08,422
Now, in these circumstances,
unless the state has obtained

580
00:41:08,423 --> 00:41:12,595
some new information relating
to my involvement in the matter,

581
00:41:12,596 --> 00:41:16,852
then I find it highly prejudical,
even constitutionally offensive,

582
00:41:16,853 --> 00:41:19,304
to keep me detained
without bail.

583
00:41:19,305 --> 00:41:21,416
It's a slippery slope,
your honor,

584
00:41:21,417 --> 00:41:25,099
Haven't we seen the result
of such violations both

585
00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:27,367
internationally and
domestically, case in point,

586
00:41:27,368 --> 00:41:32,432
would be Dave v McDonough
doc #0413825

587
00:41:33,977 --> 00:41:39,749
I am actually inclined to
agree with you, Mr Shelton.

588
00:41:39,750 --> 00:41:44,297
Your honor, Mr Shelton has
agreed to give a confession.

589
00:41:44,298 --> 00:41:47,992
Has he given it, Mr Rice?
- No, your honor.

590
00:41:48,705 --> 00:41:51,777
Well, then in my opinion
the state has failed to

591
00:41:51,778 --> 00:41:55,104
establish a compelling basis
for its motion, and I will

592
00:41:55,105 --> 00:41:56,700
grant bail in the amount of...

593
00:41:56,701 --> 00:42:00,325
Your honor, I will caution
you not to do that.

594
00:42:01,082 --> 00:42:03,839
Thank you.
- Excuse me?

595
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:06,459
No, I dont think I will
excuse you.

596
00:42:06,460 --> 00:42:08,523
You see, this is what
I'm talking about.

597
00:42:08,524 --> 00:42:10,260
You were about to
let me go,

598
00:42:10,261 --> 00:42:11,645
Are you kidding me?

599
00:42:11,646 --> 00:42:15,423
This is why we're here
in the first place.

600
00:42:16,306 --> 00:42:19,919
You think I don't remember
who you are, lady?

601
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:22,261
I would tread carefully,
Mr Shelton.

602
00:42:22,262 --> 00:42:24,055
Well, how carefully
should I tread?

603
00:42:24,056 --> 00:42:26,844
Because apparently I just
killed two people.

604
00:42:26,845 --> 00:42:31,097
And you were about to let
me walk right out that door

605
00:42:31,098 --> 00:42:33,732
How misguided are you?

606
00:42:33,733 --> 00:42:36,480
I feed you a couple of
bullshit legal presedence,

607
00:42:36,481 --> 00:42:40,180
and you go jump on it
like a bitch in heat.

608
00:42:40,181 --> 00:42:43,250
- Im warning you
- You folks you all hang
out at the same clubs.

609
00:42:43,251 --> 00:42:45,858
- You will be held in
contempt of this court.
- And everyday you let
madmen and murderers

610
00:42:45,859 --> 00:42:48,469
Back on the street. You're
too busy treating the law

611
00:42:48,470 --> 00:42:50,721
- One more time
- like if it's a fucking
assembly line

612
00:42:50,722 --> 00:42:53,018
- One more time
- Have you any idea of
what justice is?

613
00:42:53,019 --> 00:42:55,561
- You are now in contempt
of the court
- Whatever happened to
right and wrong?

614
00:42:55,562 --> 00:42:58,111
- Remove this man
- Whatever happened
to right and wrong!?

615
00:42:58,112 --> 00:42:59,970
Whatever happened
to the people.

616
00:42:59,971 --> 00:43:00,755
Bail denied!

617
00:43:00,755 --> 00:43:03,117
- Bail denied!
- Whatever happened
to justice?

618
00:43:03,118 --> 00:43:05,590
And I bet you take it
up the fucking ass!

619
00:43:05,591 --> 00:43:07,457
Bitch.
- Bailiff

620
00:43:07,458 --> 00:43:10,857
See you later, Nick.

621
00:43:10,858 --> 00:43:12,716
Insanity?

622
00:43:14,197 --> 00:43:18,524
That's what you're building
your defense on? Insanity?

623
00:43:19,637 --> 00:43:21,942
Nick, I told you I would give
you a confession.

624
00:43:21,943 --> 00:43:23,665
And I meant it.

625
00:43:23,666 --> 00:43:26,157
I saw a movie today.
- You did?

626
00:43:26,158 --> 00:43:28,748
My daughter, saw the
same movie.

627
00:43:28,749 --> 00:43:32,331
Well, you taught your daughter
about good vs evil?

628
00:43:32,332 --> 00:43:33,470
I dont have to.

629
00:43:33,471 --> 00:43:35,706
Well that's what this
movie was about.

630
00:43:35,707 --> 00:43:38,513
Good conquering Evil.
The righteous prospering,

631
00:43:38,514 --> 00:43:42,358
the wicked suffering.
- I didn't get that.

632
00:43:42,359 --> 00:43:45,337
I'm gonna give you one
more chance, Clyde.

633
00:43:45,338 --> 00:43:49,149
And dont test me, cause
I will run you over.

634
00:43:49,150 --> 00:43:50,791
Fair enough.

635
00:43:51,662 --> 00:43:56,480
You did get me my bed.
A deal's a deal.

636
00:43:56,481 --> 00:43:59,027
That was you on video,
killing Clarence Darby.

637
00:43:59,028 --> 00:44:01,283
Yes, that was me.

638
00:44:03,639 --> 00:44:07,443
Fair enough. That was me,
Clyde Shelton, on the video,

639
00:44:07,444 --> 00:44:10,068
killing Clarence Darby.
- Not good enough, Clyde,

640
00:44:10,069 --> 00:44:12,328
I need specifics.

641
00:44:14,364 --> 00:44:16,789
I took his fingers
with bolt cutters.

642
00:44:16,790 --> 00:44:18,623
His toes with tin snips.

643
00:44:18,624 --> 00:44:21,168
His balls with a hack saw.

644
00:44:21,169 --> 00:44:24,214
And his penis with
a box cutter.

645
00:44:24,501 --> 00:44:27,164
How's that for specifics?

646
00:44:27,165 --> 00:44:28,483
And Ames?

647
00:44:28,484 --> 00:44:30,674
Switching the canisters
was easy.

648
00:44:30,675 --> 00:44:32,813
Everything is automated
these days, so I just

649
00:44:32,814 --> 00:44:34,970
hacked in to the shipping
companies server and

650
00:44:34,971 --> 00:44:38,347
swapped a few numbers around
so the package came to me.

651
00:44:38,348 --> 00:44:40,322
Then I switched the
potassium chloride

652
00:44:40,322 --> 00:44:44,276
for something a little
more... deliberate.

653
00:44:46,336 --> 00:44:48,510
Well, I'm tired of
hearing your bullshit.

654
00:44:48,511 --> 00:44:51,063
I got everything I need.

655
00:44:51,064 --> 00:44:54,302
What now?
- I go home. You go to prison.

656
00:44:54,303 --> 00:44:57,289
The righteous prosper and
the wicked suffer.

657
00:44:57,290 --> 00:44:59,508
That ought to make you feel
better about the system.

658
00:44:59,509 --> 00:45:01,497
What if I had another
confession to make?

659
00:45:01,498 --> 00:45:02,785
Call a priest.

660
00:45:02,786 --> 00:45:05,364
But another confession would
mean another deal, Nick, so

661
00:45:05,365 --> 00:45:08,653
you would have to give me
something in return.

662
00:45:11,327 --> 00:45:14,633
You ever been to Del Friscos?
They cater.

663
00:45:14,634 --> 00:45:18,697
So for lunch I would love
a 20 ounce porter steak,

664
00:45:18,698 --> 00:45:21,169
medium, maybe a little charred.

665
00:45:21,170 --> 00:45:22,646
With all the trimmings:

666
00:45:22,647 --> 00:45:25,265
Pommes frites, asparagus,
butter-squash.

667
00:45:25,266 --> 00:45:27,508
- Fuck you and your
Pommes frites.

668
00:45:29,330 --> 00:45:32,715
I Tell you what. Can I
have my Ipod aswell?

669
00:45:32,716 --> 00:45:35,255
I'd love a little bit of
music with my meal.

670
00:45:35,256 --> 00:45:36,672
First rule of negotiating,
Clyde,

671
00:45:36,673 --> 00:45:38,169
you gotta have something
to bargain with.

672
00:45:38,170 --> 00:45:41,733
Would the life of
Bill Reynolds suffice?

673
00:45:47,395 --> 00:45:48,816
Open it.

674
00:45:52,805 --> 00:45:55,119
Who the fuck is
Bill Reynolds?

675
00:45:55,120 --> 00:45:56,851
Darbys attorney.

676
00:45:57,310 --> 00:46:00,586
Tell me you located him.
- I've got his wife,

677
00:46:00,587 --> 00:46:02,879
she reported him missing
three days ago.

678
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:04,705
Thank you, Mrs Reynolds.

679
00:46:04,915 --> 00:46:08,721
Looks like I got something
to bargain with, Nick.

680
00:46:10,050 --> 00:46:12,879
At the moment, Bill
Reynolds is still alive.

681
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:15,495
I'll tell you exactly
where he is,

682
00:46:15,496 --> 00:46:17,799
just bring me my meal
and my music,

683
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:21,931
at 1 o'clock exactly.
1 o'clock sharp.

684
00:46:21,932 --> 00:46:24,952
1 o'clock, Nick.

685
00:46:38,017 --> 00:46:40,072
Hold it right there.

686
00:46:51,884 --> 00:46:53,313
It's five to 1 pm.

687
00:46:53,314 --> 00:46:55,745
I dont take orders
from him, or you.

688
00:46:55,746 --> 00:46:58,538
Iinmates dont know the time,
we tell them the time.

689
00:46:58,865 --> 00:47:03,029
I dont care, we need to stick
to the agreed timeline.

690
00:47:03,030 --> 00:47:05,421
- Fuck him, Nick.
Let him wait.

691
00:47:05,422 --> 00:47:06,980
Christ, he sawed the
guys dick off.

692
00:47:06,981 --> 00:47:09,604
Whether you like it or not,
we are on his time.

693
00:47:09,605 --> 00:47:11,304
Check it again.

694
00:47:35,275 --> 00:47:38,353
Steamed Asparagus.

695
00:47:38,354 --> 00:47:41,601
Macaroni and cheese.
- Wow

696
00:47:41,602 --> 00:47:45,525
Porter house steak,
seared, medium rare.

697
00:47:54,614 --> 00:47:57,646
Napkin, Nick.
- Napkin.

698
00:47:58,872 --> 00:48:01,829
Oh, excuse me, waiter

699
00:48:01,830 --> 00:48:05,905
You might wanna put 30%
down for yourself, my man

700
00:48:08,296 --> 00:48:10,716
What time is it?
- 1 o'clock.

701
00:48:12,194 --> 00:48:15,284
Is that right, Nick?
- It's 1:08.

702
00:48:15,285 --> 00:48:17,875
Well that's dissapointing, Warden.

703
00:48:17,876 --> 00:48:20,357
How can you expect me not
to fuck with you

704
00:48:20,358 --> 00:48:21,756
when you cant even be
honest with me

705
00:48:21,757 --> 00:48:26,558
You have what you asked for,
now where's Reynolds?

706
00:48:26,559 --> 00:48:29,029
Can I have some
silverware, gentlemen ?

707
00:48:29,948 --> 00:48:31,735
You get a spork.

708
00:48:37,303 --> 00:48:38,227
Thanks.

709
00:48:48,027 --> 00:48:49,413
Come on, Clyde.

710
00:48:54,704 --> 00:48:59,186
Okay. Here we go.

711
00:48:59,187 --> 00:49:03,977
39 degrees, 57 minutes,
4 seconds, north.

712
00:49:03,978 --> 00:49:08,319
75 degrees, 10 minutes,
22 seconds, west.

713
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:09,802
You better hurry, Nick.

714
00:49:09,803 --> 00:49:12,599
By anybodys watch but the
Wardens, you're already late.

715
00:49:12,600 --> 00:49:14,216
Open the door.

716
00:49:22,020 --> 00:49:24,153
I'll sit in front of you.

717
00:49:44,684 --> 00:49:46,259
So, I suppose if I dont
share this with you

718
00:49:46,260 --> 00:49:49,798
I'm gonna get the fuck up,
take my right hand,

719
00:49:49,799 --> 00:49:54,271
and split your skull in two,
how about that?

720
00:49:55,501 --> 00:49:57,016
Come on over here, join me

721
00:49:57,017 --> 00:49:59,635
There's plenty to go around.

722
00:50:04,388 --> 00:50:08,667
Enjoy it. Pasta. It's good.

723
00:50:08,668 --> 00:50:13,017
What about some steak?
You like steak?

724
00:50:13,018 --> 00:50:17,175
Big piece for you.
There you go.

725
00:50:21,035 --> 00:50:21,774
Good, huh?

726
00:50:31,846 --> 00:50:35,105
What did you do to
get in here, anyways?

727
00:50:36,465 --> 00:50:40,002
I did what I had to do.

728
00:50:43,889 --> 00:50:46,505
So you got a girl
or something?

729
00:50:49,771 --> 00:50:51,957
It's a long story.

730
00:50:55,632 --> 00:50:58,848
Pilot, how much longer?
- ETA 2 minutes

731
00:51:04,031 --> 00:51:06,202
How about you?
Have a girl?

732
00:51:06,203 --> 00:51:09,197
Got a few broads back home.
- Oh yeah?

733
00:51:10,189 --> 00:51:12,292
You don't have a boyfriend
in here right now?

734
00:51:12,293 --> 00:51:13,293
Get the fuck out of here.

735
00:51:27,656 --> 00:51:30,209
It's his. His briefcase.

736
00:51:32,086 --> 00:51:33,270
Just dig.

737
00:51:47,331 --> 00:51:53,357
Jesus Christ.
- Reynolds! Reynolds!

738
00:51:53,358 --> 00:51:57,646
He's gone.
- Oxygen?

739
00:51:57,647 --> 00:51:58,447
Get something to
get him out.

740
00:51:58,648 --> 00:52:03,698
IV lines going to his...
Fuck. He's got him cuffed.

741
00:52:03,699 --> 00:52:06,787
You got your keys?
To the cuffs.

742
00:52:15,751 --> 00:52:18,597
It's your lucky day, huh?
Get some food.

743
00:52:18,598 --> 00:52:21,732
Here, take a shot at this.

744
00:53:32,699 --> 00:53:34,808
I need a shower, Warden.

745
00:53:34,809 --> 00:53:35,880
Get him out of there!

746
00:53:39,944 --> 00:53:42,141
Dunningan, what time
do you have?

747
00:53:44,305 --> 00:53:45,754
I'm 1:37.

748
00:53:45,755 --> 00:53:48,065
Took us roughly 15
minutes to get here.

749
00:53:48,066 --> 00:53:48,823
Yeah.

750
00:53:48,824 --> 00:53:51,619
Reynolds air was rigged to
shut off at 1:15

751
00:53:51,620 --> 00:53:54,680
If Shelton had his lunch on
time he'd still be alive.

752
00:53:54,681 --> 00:53:57,274
Fuck this guy, Nick.
He wants to play games,

753
00:53:57,275 --> 00:53:59,557
we can play games too.

754
00:54:00,281 --> 00:54:03,173
We need to take the gloves off.

755
00:54:08,252 --> 00:54:11,542
Hey Nick, it's Sarah. Listen.
Clyde murdered his cellmate.

756
00:54:11,543 --> 00:54:15,318
Warden is furious, he's
moving him to solitary.

757
00:54:15,319 --> 00:54:18,068
That's all I know right now.

758
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:15,994
Found Reynolds.

759
00:55:15,995 --> 00:55:18,968
Well, it was too late,
you are here.

760
00:55:18,969 --> 00:55:21,100
I had to call his wife and
tell her that her husband

761
00:55:21,101 --> 00:55:22,925
had been buried alive.

762
00:55:22,926 --> 00:55:25,692
Well, justice should
be harsh, Nick.

763
00:55:25,693 --> 00:55:28,754
Especially for those who
denied it to others.

764
00:55:28,755 --> 00:55:31,247
And your cellmate, what
was that about?

765
00:55:35,196 --> 00:55:37,553
You murdered a man because
your lunch was late.

766
00:55:37,554 --> 00:55:41,058
No. No.

767
00:55:41,059 --> 00:55:44,746
No, you murdered him because
you couldn't keep your word.

768
00:55:44,747 --> 00:55:47,454
We made a deal
you and I, 1:00 pm.

769
00:55:47,455 --> 00:55:50,760
Now that's an important principle
I'd like you to learn, Nick.

770
00:55:50,761 --> 00:55:53,074
Keeping your word.
- Oh, really?

771
00:55:53,075 --> 00:55:54,447
Well, what principle was
at work when you

772
00:55:54,448 --> 00:55:55,925
tortured and killed
those people?

773
00:55:55,926 --> 00:56:00,262
That everyone must be held
accountable for their actions.

774
00:56:06,192 --> 00:56:08,950
You think your wife and
daughter would feel good

775
00:56:08,951 --> 00:56:11,963
about you killing
in their name?

776
00:56:37,279 --> 00:56:41,184
My wife and daughter
can't feel anything.

777
00:56:42,479 --> 00:56:44,572
They're dead.

778
00:57:20,980 --> 00:57:24,650
Hey, Nick. On Clydes real estate,
judge Stansfeld shut us down.

779
00:57:24,651 --> 00:57:28,311
He's looking for some legal
precedent Im not sure exists.

780
00:57:28,312 --> 00:57:30,153
But?
- But, I think I may have

781
00:57:30,154 --> 00:57:31,672
found a way around him,
I'm gonna call in a favour

782
00:57:31,673 --> 00:57:33,373
from a friend.
- Who's your friend?

783
00:57:33,374 --> 00:57:35,689
You don't name your friends
or they stop doing favours.

784
00:57:35,690 --> 00:57:39,765
Something else Cantrell said?
- No, thats all you.

785
00:57:39,766 --> 00:57:41,386
Jonas. Hi.

786
00:57:42,835 --> 00:57:44,346
She's thinking just
like you, Nick.

787
00:57:44,347 --> 00:57:45,783
Guess you trained her well.

788
00:57:45,784 --> 00:57:49,833
One day she'll have my job.
- Let's get some air.

789
00:57:51,959 --> 00:57:54,272
Clydes government contract
payments were bothering me,

790
00:57:54,273 --> 00:57:57,096
I pulled some old strings.
We're meeting someone.

791
00:57:57,097 --> 00:57:58,330
Who might that be?

792
00:57:58,331 --> 00:58:00,039
Someone who does some
really nasty shit

793
00:58:00,040 --> 00:58:02,506
so we can live the
american dream.

794
00:58:14,729 --> 00:58:17,250
So Clyde finally lost it?

795
00:58:17,251 --> 00:58:19,847
Somebody must have
really pissed him off.

796
00:58:19,848 --> 00:58:21,648
You worked with Shelton,
is that right?

797
00:58:21,649 --> 00:58:25,709
First of all, I was never
here, and we never spoke.

798
00:58:25,710 --> 00:58:26,982
Tell us what we're
dealing with.

799
00:58:26,983 --> 00:58:29,551
Shelton was a spy?
- Spies are a dime a dozen.

800
00:58:29,552 --> 00:58:30,851
I'm a spy.

801
00:58:30,852 --> 00:58:34,477
Clyde is a brain. He's a
think-tank type guy.

802
00:58:34,478 --> 00:58:37,151
His specialty was low
impact kinetic operations.

803
00:58:37,152 --> 00:58:39,641
Just a fancy way to say
that he kills people.

804
00:58:39,642 --> 00:58:40,724
We kill people.

805
00:58:40,725 --> 00:58:43,950
He figured out how to do it
without being in the same room.

806
00:58:43,951 --> 00:58:47,496
It was his gift.
And he was the best.

807
00:58:47,497 --> 00:58:49,944
One time we're tasking
this tricky target.

808
00:58:49,945 --> 00:58:52,680
We were using cruise
missiles, predators,

809
00:58:52,681 --> 00:58:55,507
we even had a B-2 bomber
fly to this guys villa

810
00:58:55,508 --> 00:58:57,974
to jade him. We're burning up
millions in ordinance,

811
00:58:57,975 --> 00:58:59,611
we're getting nowhere
with this guy.

812
00:58:59,612 --> 00:59:02,975
So we call Clyde. We ask
him to solve our problem.

813
00:59:02,976 --> 00:59:05,914
Clyde develops a kevlar
thread, with a high-tech

814
00:59:05,915 --> 00:59:08,031
ratchet made of
carbon fiber.

815
00:59:08,032 --> 00:59:10,962
Puts it in a necktie.
Two days later,

816
00:59:10,963 --> 00:59:13,647
Mrs Bad Guy comes home,
finds Mr Bad Guy

817
00:59:13,648 --> 00:59:17,532
dead on the bathroom tile.
Choked to death.

818
00:59:18,519 --> 00:59:20,554
What I'm saying is, just
assume that this guy

819
00:59:20,555 --> 00:59:23,238
can hear and see everything
that you are doing.

820
00:59:23,239 --> 00:59:25,470
No, we got him locked
under maximum security.

821
00:59:25,471 --> 00:59:28,658
If he's in jail it's because
he wants to be in jail.

822
00:59:28,659 --> 00:59:31,186
He's a born tactician.
Every move he makes,

823
00:59:31,187 --> 00:59:33,081
it means something.

824
00:59:33,769 --> 00:59:37,702
That cellmate that he killed,
you think that was random?

825
00:59:37,703 --> 00:59:38,703
No.

826
00:59:39,754 --> 00:59:42,567
That's a pawn being
moved over the board.

827
00:59:44,133 --> 00:59:47,524
And if I were you, I'd be
looking for the next piece.

828
00:59:47,525 --> 00:59:49,673
Anybody who had anything
to do with that case,

829
00:59:49,674 --> 00:59:51,772
he's gonna be coming
after you.

830
00:59:52,677 --> 00:59:57,042
So what are you saying?
That we can't stop him?

831
00:59:59,441 --> 01:00:02,888
Walk into his cell and
put a bullet in his head.

832
01:00:03,820 --> 01:00:06,686
Aside from that, no,
you can't stop him.

833
01:00:06,687 --> 01:00:09,459
If Clyde wants you dead,
you're dead.

834
01:00:20,986 --> 01:00:23,799
Hello?
- Sarah, it's me.

835
01:00:23,800 --> 01:00:25,558
Setup a meeting with
judge Birch.

836
01:00:25,559 --> 01:00:28,070
We need her to help
keep Clyde on ice.

837
01:00:28,071 --> 01:00:30,904
Help us with what, Nick?
The man's in prison.

838
01:00:30,905 --> 01:00:32,507
It's worse than we thought.

839
01:00:32,508 --> 01:00:37,223
Chester's your boyfriend, right?
- Chester? Yeah.

840
01:00:37,224 --> 01:00:41,027
Good. Maybe stay a few
days at his place.

841
01:00:41,028 --> 01:00:44,002
And have Dunnigan send
a patrol car to my house.

842
01:00:44,003 --> 01:00:46,359
Sorry about this, Sarah.

843
01:00:53,043 --> 01:00:56,055
I can't supercede the penal
code. You've already got him

844
01:00:56,056 --> 01:00:57,772
in solitary, a half-decent
paralegal will have him

845
01:00:57,773 --> 01:01:00,884
out of there by next week.
- We just want to limit his options.

846
01:01:00,885 --> 01:01:02,914
Give him less contact.
Less access.

847
01:01:02,915 --> 01:01:06,228
Even if it's just rescinding his
mandatory exercise for a week.

848
01:01:06,229 --> 01:01:08,739
Under what cause?
- Whatever cause you want.

849
01:01:08,740 --> 01:01:10,988
Wrap it around whatever
piece of legal doctrine

850
01:01:10,989 --> 01:01:14,657
that helps you rationalize it.
Your honor.

851
01:01:16,120 --> 01:01:19,247
So, let me get this straight.
You want me to violate

852
01:01:19,248 --> 01:01:21,619
his God-given civil rights
in the name of some

853
01:01:21,620 --> 01:01:25,971
murky sense of the greater
good, is that the jist of it?

854
01:01:32,736 --> 01:01:35,623
Okay. I'm game.

855
01:01:35,992 --> 01:01:40,079
Just dont plan on it
sticking for long. Alright?

856
01:01:44,096 --> 01:01:45,843
What, you gonna take that?
After all the grief

857
01:01:45,844 --> 01:01:47,570
you've given me over
cell phones?

858
01:01:47,571 --> 01:01:50,759
Thats one of the benefits
of being a judge, Mr Rice,

859
01:01:50,760 --> 01:01:53,744
I can pretty much do
whatever I want.

860
01:01:56,499 --> 01:01:56,919
Hello?

861
01:02:00,201 --> 01:02:02,205
Oh my God.

862
01:02:03,878 --> 01:02:04,890
Back up.

863
01:02:26,563 --> 01:02:29,006
So you're killing
judges now?

864
01:02:29,007 --> 01:02:31,679
In my experience, Nick,
lessons not learned in blood

865
01:02:31,680 --> 01:02:32,910
are soon forgotten.

866
01:02:32,911 --> 01:02:35,736
And vengeance keeps
you warm at night?

867
01:02:35,737 --> 01:02:37,816
Vengeance?

868
01:02:39,335 --> 01:02:42,698
That's what you think this
is about? Vengeance!?

869
01:02:42,699 --> 01:02:44,571
What else could it be?
- No, Nick,

870
01:02:44,572 --> 01:02:48,223
I had ten years for vengeance,
if that's what I wanted.

871
01:02:48,731 --> 01:02:51,055
You don't think that
I watch you go to work,

872
01:02:51,056 --> 01:02:52,677
every morning 8:00 am?

873
01:02:52,678 --> 01:02:56,419
Or that I watch Ellie take
Denise to school 8:15?

874
01:02:56,420 --> 01:02:59,016
No, I could've slaughtered
you or your family,

875
01:02:59,017 --> 01:03:00,907
anytime I wanted, Nick.
- If you even think about

876
01:03:00,908 --> 01:03:02,819
touching my family.

877
01:03:03,443 --> 01:03:08,297
If you even think about
touching my family.

878
01:03:15,591 --> 01:03:20,215
I do my job.
I'm the best at it.

879
01:03:20,216 --> 01:03:21,150
It works.

880
01:03:21,151 --> 01:03:24,109
You were doing your job,
the way it best served you, Nick.

881
01:03:24,110 --> 01:03:27,216
The way it best served you.

882
01:03:27,217 --> 01:03:30,126
That has to change.
- What do you want, Clyde?

883
01:03:30,127 --> 01:03:33,388
Your war with the world, It's not
gonna bring anybody back.

884
01:03:33,389 --> 01:03:39,892
No, Im at war with this.
This, this broken thing.

885
01:03:40,261 --> 01:03:42,130
This thing that brought
you and I together.

886
01:03:42,131 --> 01:03:44,998
This broken thing works,
for people that are sane.

887
01:03:44,999 --> 01:03:47,203
You think doing what you're
doing is gonna change anything?

888
01:03:47,204 --> 01:03:51,706
You, and whoever you have
helping you, are gonna pay.

889
01:03:53,659 --> 01:03:57,409
I don't think you have any
idea who's helping me.

890
01:03:57,410 --> 01:03:59,801
Or what I'm doing.
- It's a matter of time.

891
01:03:59,802 --> 01:04:02,745
You see the bodies,
you see the smoke.

892
01:04:02,746 --> 01:04:05,487
But the larger picture
still eludes you.

893
01:04:05,488 --> 01:04:07,357
Do tell.

894
01:04:08,878 --> 01:04:14,631
I would like to, but
I would rather show you.

895
01:04:16,197 --> 01:04:19,861
I have faith in you, so I will
give you one last chance.

896
01:04:19,862 --> 01:04:20,862
Here's the deal:

897
01:04:20,863 --> 01:04:26,237
Release me. And drop
all charges by 6:00 am.

898
01:04:26,238 --> 01:04:28,931
6:00 am, Nick.
- Or what?

899
01:04:31,524 --> 01:04:34,568
Or I kill everyone.

900
01:04:45,899 --> 01:04:47,717
Hello?
- Yeah, Sarah,

901
01:04:47,718 --> 01:04:49,938
He has to have an accomplice.
Probably somebody inside

902
01:04:49,939 --> 01:04:52,887
the prison. We have to go
through all the prisons files

903
01:04:52,888 --> 01:04:54,254
to find some connection.

904
01:04:54,255 --> 01:04:55,840
- Do you want the files
run to the office?

905
01:04:55,841 --> 01:04:58,226
No, there isn't time.
Get everybody together,

906
01:04:58,227 --> 01:05:01,037
and bring them to the prison.
We're moving in.

907
01:05:19,299 --> 01:05:21,578
Stop looking at your watch.

908
01:05:23,631 --> 01:05:24,991
Anything from your friend?

909
01:05:24,992 --> 01:05:27,868
This treaty with Panama
is a mess. We cant access

910
01:05:27,869 --> 01:05:30,725
anything about property
holdings, but my friend found

911
01:05:30,725 --> 01:05:35,888
this loophole for access to
clients corporate expenses.

912
01:05:35,889 --> 01:05:37,530
Does that help?

913
01:05:41,878 --> 01:05:45,334
So match sell prices of industrial
property sold in Philly,

914
01:05:45,335 --> 01:05:49,030
up against purchases made
by his corporation.

915
01:05:49,833 --> 01:05:52,198
Okay. I got it.

916
01:06:00,980 --> 01:06:03,610
Hey, Nick, can I ask
you something?

917
01:06:06,601 --> 01:06:09,700
Would you do it the same
way now, would you still

918
01:06:09,701 --> 01:06:11,825
cut a deal for Darby?

919
01:06:13,375 --> 01:06:17,174
This is a job, Sarah.
We have to make choices.

920
01:06:17,175 --> 01:06:21,761
Did you make the right choice?
- We made the right choice.

921
01:06:23,838 --> 01:06:29,794
I don't know. I'm 35, Nick,
and there are things,

922
01:06:29,795 --> 01:06:33,162
possibilities that I'm not
gonna have now.

923
01:06:33,720 --> 01:06:38,491
And it's okay. And it was
part of the deal.

924
01:06:39,535 --> 01:06:43,399
Don't get me wrong,
I love working for you.

925
01:06:47,328 --> 01:06:49,692
But I just wanna know that
I gave up those things for

926
01:06:49,693 --> 01:06:52,773
more than just a high
conviction rate.

927
01:08:08,127 --> 01:08:12,289
Alright, lets just get focused.
This guy is not God.

928
01:08:12,290 --> 01:08:14,999
He's not the all-powerful,
he's just well prepared.

929
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:17,263
We need to be equally
well prepared.

930
01:08:17,264 --> 01:08:19,246
Take a couple of hours,
go home, come back,

931
01:08:19,247 --> 01:08:22,034
and we'll get a fresh start.
Okay?

932
01:08:51,179 --> 01:08:56,719
Hey Nick. Get some rest.
- Give Chester my regards.

933
01:08:56,720 --> 01:09:01,538
When do I get to meet him?
- Oh, he's not ready for that.

934
01:09:02,657 --> 01:09:04,053
Good night, Jonas.

935
01:09:15,986 --> 01:09:18,168
I don't know how this one's
gonna turn out, Nick.

936
01:09:18,169 --> 01:09:20,350
We're gonna stop him, that's
how it's gonna turn out.

937
01:09:30,858 --> 01:09:33,739
Noo! No.

938
01:09:40,788 --> 01:09:42,495
Sarah.

939
01:10:13,506 --> 01:10:15,979
<i>In the past 48 hours,
6 officials from the

940
01:10:15,980 --> 01:10:17,765
<i>Justice Department
have been killed in

941
01:10:17,766 --> 01:10:20,631
<i>a series of vicious and
premeditated attacks.

942
01:10:20,632 --> 01:10:23,504
<i>This marks the first time
in the history of the US

943
01:10:23,505 --> 01:10:26,473
<i>where government officials,
have been, by all appearances,

944
01:10:26,474 --> 01:10:29,041
<i>Systematically murdered.

945
01:10:35,866 --> 01:10:38,495
Nick, I'm sorry to have to do this,
but we got something here.

946
01:10:38,496 --> 01:10:41,312
Found this.
Right outside the wall.

947
01:10:41,313 --> 01:10:43,555
Radio beacon.

948
01:10:43,556 --> 01:10:45,238
Sent an arming signal
to the car bombs when

949
01:10:45,239 --> 01:10:47,187
they went through the gate.
- Security said they checked

950
01:10:47,188 --> 01:10:48,780
every car before they
got here.

951
01:10:48,781 --> 01:10:52,069
Better check the gas stations.

952
01:10:52,606 --> 01:10:54,441
Real precise stuff too.

953
01:10:54,442 --> 01:10:56,274
Could have taken out a
lot more if he wanted to.

954
01:10:56,275 --> 01:10:59,145
What about Nicks car?
- That's the weird thing.

955
01:10:59,146 --> 01:11:02,006
It's clean. Haven't been touched.

956
01:11:03,440 --> 01:11:05,495
I gotta go.

957
01:11:13,336 --> 01:11:15,132
Jesus Christ.

958
01:11:23,628 --> 01:11:25,642
Privacy.
- Yes, ma'am.

959
01:11:27,647 --> 01:11:29,770
So let me get this straight.

960
01:11:30,682 --> 01:11:33,192
Not only do we know who did it,

961
01:11:33,193 --> 01:11:37,049
We have him locked up and
he's still killing people?

962
01:11:39,206 --> 01:11:42,756
You boys sure fucked
this one up.

963
01:11:43,360 --> 01:11:46,749
The press is gonna kill us.

964
01:11:47,513 --> 01:11:49,414
Can someone explain
this to me?

965
01:11:49,415 --> 01:11:51,439
We can't yet.

966
01:11:56,816 --> 01:11:59,826
How did this get away
from you, Jonas?

967
01:12:00,071 --> 01:12:01,981
It's complicated, April.

968
01:12:01,982 --> 01:12:04,928
He's very smart.
He's very angry.

969
01:12:04,929 --> 01:12:07,825
We assume he has an accomlice
helping him on the outside.

970
01:12:07,826 --> 01:12:11,448
I'm not having this conversation.

971
01:12:11,449 --> 01:12:15,336
I don't care how smart he is,
or who's helping him.

972
01:12:21,111 --> 01:12:23,121
Release a statement saying
we have suspects,

973
01:12:23,122 --> 01:12:25,030
we're following leads,
nothing alarming.

974
01:12:25,031 --> 01:12:29,326
Mayor, you have my word.
We are gonna stop this guy,

975
01:12:29,327 --> 01:12:32,088
he's not gonna hurt
anybody else.

976
01:12:36,374 --> 01:12:39,759
I'm assigning security to
each of you from now on.

977
01:12:43,466 --> 01:12:46,554
Get this situation under
control, gentlemen.

978
01:12:50,393 --> 01:12:54,466
No phone calls, no credit cards,
no computers. Just cash.

979
01:12:54,893 --> 01:12:56,952
Daddy, are you coming?

980
01:12:59,099 --> 01:13:02,270
Of course I am.
- You better, Nick.

981
01:13:05,113 --> 01:13:07,583
Need to go.
- I love you, Nick.

982
01:13:07,584 --> 01:13:09,864
Come on baby.

983
01:13:09,865 --> 01:13:12,442
Love you, daddy
- Love you too.

984
01:13:17,071 --> 01:13:20,596
Nick, phone line's clear.
Nobody has been tampering,

985
01:13:20,597 --> 01:13:21,597
Good.

986
01:14:23,010 --> 01:14:24,660
Should have taken my deal.

987
01:14:29,708 --> 01:14:33,590
Six fucking innocent people,
that's how you wanna play it?

988
01:14:33,591 --> 01:14:36,824
It's okay. It's okay.
I know you're angry.

989
01:14:36,825 --> 01:14:38,287
That's good.
That's what it takes.

990
01:14:38,288 --> 01:14:39,339
That's how is has to be.

991
01:14:39,340 --> 01:14:41,198
What if I said you fighting
them was wrong?

992
01:14:41,199 --> 01:14:44,378
What if I had said let's
take them to trial.

993
01:14:44,379 --> 01:14:45,580
I would say you're
making progress.

994
01:14:45,581 --> 01:14:48,185
And we might have lost.
And Ames and Darby

995
01:14:48,186 --> 01:14:51,353
would both go free.
Don't you get that?

996
01:14:53,499 --> 01:14:56,583
You didn't care, Nick.
You didn't even try.

997
01:14:56,584 --> 01:14:57,561
You could've walked
out of court

998
01:14:57,562 --> 01:15:01,020
with your head held high.
I could've lived with that, Nick.

999
01:15:01,021 --> 01:15:05,777
I keep my head high,
and you will end this.

1000
01:15:08,107 --> 01:15:10,045
I've just gotten warmed up.

1001
01:15:10,046 --> 01:15:14,617
This is when it turns into
a shit total fucking war.

1002
01:15:20,955 --> 01:15:23,794
I'm gonna pull the whole
thing down.

1003
01:15:23,795 --> 01:15:25,744
I'm gonna bring the whole
fucking diseased

1004
01:15:25,745 --> 01:15:28,986
corrupt temple down
on your head.

1005
01:15:29,748 --> 01:15:32,505
It's gonna be biblical.

1006
01:15:49,569 --> 01:15:52,450
Jesus, Nick, she was
a good kid.

1007
01:15:53,730 --> 01:15:57,028
Did we bring this all
on ourselves?

1008
01:15:58,467 --> 01:16:00,729
Absolutely not.

1009
01:16:03,108 --> 01:16:05,863
You don't actually believe
that, do you?

1010
01:16:10,157 --> 01:16:11,526
Alright, gentlemen.

1011
01:16:11,527 --> 01:16:15,005
Sorry, we need to get going
to the press conference.

1012
01:16:25,870 --> 01:16:29,863
Stay sharp.
We're on the move.

1013
01:17:46,405 --> 01:17:48,753
We alright?
- It's dead.

1014
01:17:48,754 --> 01:17:50,533
Electrical system fried.

1015
01:17:51,190 --> 01:17:53,297
<i>What's going on back there?

1016
01:17:55,572 --> 01:17:58,407
Dunningan, tell them to
get Jonas away.

1017
01:18:06,371 --> 01:18:08,626
What the fuck is that?

1018
01:18:10,656 --> 01:18:11,829
Get down! Get down!

1019
01:18:36,596 --> 01:18:37,874
Jonas!

1020
01:18:39,844 --> 01:18:41,521
No, Nick!
You can't.

1021
01:18:50,487 --> 01:18:52,112
Please, listen to me!

1022
01:18:56,160 --> 01:18:57,276
Jonas!

1023
01:18:57,961 --> 01:18:59,130
Jonas.

1024
01:19:19,480 --> 01:19:22,592
I told you to handle this.

1025
01:19:22,593 --> 01:19:24,070
You didn't.

1026
01:19:24,071 --> 01:19:26,485
Now we have a jailed
psycopath who's managed

1027
01:19:26,486 --> 01:19:29,645
to bring this entire
city to its knees.

1028
01:19:30,802 --> 01:19:33,535
One of my friends was
just murdered.

1029
01:19:34,653 --> 01:19:38,471
More than one of my friends
is gone, Mayor.

1030
01:19:38,472 --> 01:19:41,606
What I should do is fire you.

1031
01:19:42,211 --> 01:19:44,007
Right now.

1032
01:19:44,655 --> 01:19:46,948
I resign.

1033
01:19:47,945 --> 01:19:51,646
Is that your real answer?
- I think that's best.

1034
01:19:56,765 --> 01:20:00,639
No. I'm not gonna
allow that to happen.

1035
01:20:00,640 --> 01:20:02,520
Bring me the bible.

1036
01:20:02,521 --> 01:20:05,013
I wont let some criminal
decide whether Philadelphia

1037
01:20:05,114 --> 01:20:06,433
has a DA or not.

1038
01:20:06,823 --> 01:20:09,820
As of now you're acting
District Attorney.

1039
01:20:09,821 --> 01:20:11,855
We'll have a formal
swearing in later.

1040
01:20:11,856 --> 01:20:16,333
For now, this will
suffice. Stand up.

1041
01:20:17,537 --> 01:20:19,757
Put your left hand on the
bible, raise your right hand,

1042
01:20:19,758 --> 01:20:21,577
Repeat after me:

1043
01:20:21,578 --> 01:20:24,318
I, Nicholas Rice

1044
01:20:24,319 --> 01:20:25,775
Do solemnly swear,

1045
01:20:25,776 --> 01:20:28,114
That I will support,

1046
01:20:28,115 --> 01:20:29,312
Obey,

1047
01:20:29,313 --> 01:20:32,602
And defend the
constitution of the US

1048
01:20:46,195 --> 01:20:49,245
People aren't going to work,
kids aren't going to school,

1049
01:20:49,246 --> 01:20:52,112
They're scared.
And I dont blame them.

1050
01:20:52,113 --> 01:20:54,399
So I'm implementing the
emergency provision

1051
01:20:54,400 --> 01:20:57,569
of the Philadelphia code,
we will lock this city down.

1052
01:20:57,570 --> 01:21:01,371
Starting now noone moves
in this city unrestricted.

1053
01:21:01,372 --> 01:21:03,410
I want a show of force
for the public.

1054
01:21:03,411 --> 01:21:06,388
Uniforms, detectives,
12 hour shifts.

1055
01:21:06,389 --> 01:21:08,271
Put an armed cop on
every corner.

1056
01:21:08,272 --> 01:21:11,252
If you have to give shotguns
to the meter maids, do it.

1057
01:21:11,253 --> 01:21:13,495
There should be no doubt
in peoples minds that the

1058
01:21:13,496 --> 01:21:17,169
city is secure and under
our control.

1059
01:21:27,487 --> 01:21:31,666
Okay, Clyde. I get it.

1060
01:21:34,738 --> 01:21:37,829
Listen, that contraption
that killed Cantrell,

1061
01:21:37,830 --> 01:21:41,106
it was a weaponized
bomb disposal robot.

1062
01:21:41,107 --> 01:21:42,444
Can you believe that?

1063
01:21:42,445 --> 01:21:45,552
Damn thing had video,
night vision, you name it.

1064
01:21:45,553 --> 01:21:48,837
It fired military API
for christ sake.

1065
01:21:48,838 --> 01:21:51,628
That's anti-tank rounds, Nick.

1066
01:21:51,629 --> 01:21:54,387
I think he's saving you for last.

1067
01:21:57,065 --> 01:21:59,433
Nick, I'm serious.

1068
01:22:00,753 --> 01:22:03,008
Appreciate the insight.

1069
01:22:06,735 --> 01:22:11,316
Nick, get in front of this guy
if you want to stay alive.

1070
01:22:13,323 --> 01:22:15,961
I may have a way.

1071
01:22:15,962 --> 01:22:19,011
Something a friend is
helping me out with.

1072
01:22:19,335 --> 01:22:21,218
Your friend?

1073
01:22:21,219 --> 01:22:23,629
Man named Chester, I'll
call you back.

1074
01:22:25,669 --> 01:22:27,305
Thank you, Sarah.

1075
01:22:27,306 --> 01:22:30,068
"Hope this helps. -C"

1076
01:22:30,069 --> 01:22:33,058
"CLYDE SHELTON CORPORATE
EXPENSE RECORDS"

1077
01:22:35,043 --> 01:22:36,162
It's Nick.

1078
01:22:36,163 --> 01:22:38,806
Give me the real estate listing
of every industrial property

1079
01:22:38,807 --> 01:22:41,484
sold here in the last
10 years.

1080
01:23:06,720 --> 01:23:09,211
Motherfucker.

1081
01:23:27,433 --> 01:23:29,487
You're kidding me, right?

1082
01:23:30,332 --> 01:23:32,673
You're saying Clyde
owns this place?

1083
01:23:32,674 --> 01:23:35,120
Something about it
sticks out, right?

1084
01:23:35,605 --> 01:23:37,148
Yeah.

1085
01:23:41,053 --> 01:23:45,224
Uhhh, you'll do what
I think you're gonna do?

1086
01:23:45,225 --> 01:23:46,958
What about his civil rights?

1087
01:23:46,959 --> 01:23:48,763
Fuck his civil rights.

1088
01:23:52,605 --> 01:23:54,547
Yeah!

1089
01:24:38,843 --> 01:24:40,875
There's gotta be
something in here.

1090
01:24:40,876 --> 01:24:42,334
Yeah.

1091
01:24:59,242 --> 01:25:01,976
Remember this, from
outside the house?

1092
01:25:28,346 --> 01:25:31,758
Un-fucking believable.

1093
01:25:44,852 --> 01:25:46,336
Look at this.

1094
01:25:52,643 --> 01:25:53,923
Watch your step.

1095
01:25:59,546 --> 01:26:01,918
This guy tunneled
into prison?

1096
01:26:21,055 --> 01:26:22,977
Holy shit.

1097
01:26:28,064 --> 01:26:30,082
Fuck, Semtex.

1098
01:26:34,821 --> 01:26:37,754
Police uniforms,
other disguises.

1099
01:27:01,823 --> 01:27:03,843
He tunneled into
every cell.

1100
01:27:04,183 --> 01:27:05,086
Over here.

1101
01:27:10,404 --> 01:27:14,554
Oh shit. He wanted to be
transfered to solitary.

1102
01:27:14,555 --> 01:27:17,449
Surprise, motherfucker.

1103
01:28:00,492 --> 01:28:03,267
He's not here.
- Then where is he?

1104
01:28:09,134 --> 01:28:10,534
Nomos, what happened
to your eye?

1105
01:28:10,535 --> 01:28:12,950
Ah, long story.

1106
01:28:14,090 --> 01:28:15,605
Step right here, Sir.

1107
01:28:15,606 --> 01:28:20,102
Lets see your ID, please.
- Yeah, sure.

1108
01:28:20,103 --> 01:28:22,554
Turn around, Sir,
extend your arms.

1109
01:28:24,419 --> 01:28:26,291
Something going
on tonight?

1110
01:28:26,316 --> 01:28:27,746
The Mayor.

1111
01:28:37,259 --> 01:28:39,305
Look at this.

1112
01:28:39,306 --> 01:28:41,537
He tapped into
the prison cams.

1113
01:28:41,538 --> 01:28:43,991
Jesus, he's got
cameras everywhere.

1114
01:28:49,249 --> 01:28:50,853
Von Clausewitz.

1115
01:28:59,585 --> 01:29:02,304
"City Hall Access Card"
"PHILADELPHIA CITY HALL"

1116
01:29:04,818 --> 01:29:06,912
He's at City Hall.

1117
01:29:08,329 --> 01:29:10,002
Free to go, Sir.

1118
01:29:10,003 --> 01:29:13,051
Sorry for the inconvenience.
- Don't worry about it.

1119
01:29:14,759 --> 01:29:17,523
Better be safe than
sorry, right?

1120
01:29:18,651 --> 01:29:20,503
Get ready to evacuate
the building.

1121
01:29:20,504 --> 01:29:22,576
We'll need a tactical unit
and a bomb squad.

1122
01:29:22,577 --> 01:29:24,263
Bad idea. Have them
come in soft.

1123
01:29:24,264 --> 01:29:26,960
If Shelton spots them or
any of us we're fucked.

1124
01:29:51,270 --> 01:29:52,178
Hey.

1125
01:29:55,707 --> 01:29:58,763
Where's the tactical team?
- Coming in soft, no sirens.

1126
01:29:58,764 --> 01:30:01,109
Bomb squad?
- You're looking at it.

1127
01:30:01,110 --> 01:30:02,566
Great. Okay.

1128
01:30:02,567 --> 01:30:05,540
We'll take the north
stairs, you take the west.

1129
01:30:11,339 --> 01:30:12,854
Woah, woah, woah.
ID's please.

1130
01:30:12,855 --> 01:30:15,354
He's the fucking DA!
- Good for him. ID's please.

1131
01:30:15,355 --> 01:30:17,229
What's going on here tonight?

1132
01:30:17,898 --> 01:30:19,171
Judy meeting with
all the press.

1133
01:30:19,172 --> 01:30:22,856
What floor?
- 6th floor, Caucus room.

1134
01:30:25,447 --> 01:30:29,201
What floor is this?
- That's the 5th floor, Sir.

1135
01:30:29,202 --> 01:30:31,577
Directly below the
Caucus room.

1136
01:30:31,578 --> 01:30:32,937
If we catch this
motherfucker red handed,

1137
01:30:32,938 --> 01:30:34,834
we gotta take him alive.

1138
01:30:57,048 --> 01:30:58,418
Where is he?

1139
01:30:59,431 --> 01:31:01,502
What the fuck are
we looking for?

1140
01:31:01,503 --> 01:31:05,897
Wait, wait wait.
Right there.

1141
01:31:05,898 --> 01:31:08,525
Stand back, dont
touch anything.

1142
01:31:09,564 --> 01:31:12,336
Wasn't exactly
my first instinct.

1143
01:32:37,616 --> 01:32:41,604
It's napalm, basically.

1144
01:32:41,605 --> 01:32:44,987
This will take out this
floor and the floor above.

1145
01:32:45,521 --> 01:32:49,650
Looks like it's triggered
by this cell phone here.

1146
01:32:50,085 --> 01:32:53,547
What, so, an incoming
call arms it?

1147
01:32:53,548 --> 01:32:57,462
Yeah. Maybe 30 seconds
until boom time.

1148
01:32:58,862 --> 01:33:00,941
Jesus.
- Dunningan, what are you doing?

1149
01:33:00,942 --> 01:33:03,029
I'm calling the Mayors security.
- We can't

1150
01:33:03,030 --> 01:33:06,342
Clyde is watching. If he sees them
evacuate he will detonate.

1151
01:33:06,343 --> 01:33:09,449
We don't tell the Mayor
anything.

1152
01:33:11,631 --> 01:33:13,609
So, what do we do?

1153
01:33:24,012 --> 01:33:26,402
Wait a second.

1154
01:33:26,403 --> 01:33:29,263
We got something.
- He's pulling up.

1155
01:33:49,708 --> 01:33:51,999
Thank you for coming in
on short notice.

1156
01:33:58,327 --> 01:34:02,620
I have one simple question.

1157
01:34:02,621 --> 01:34:05,811
Why is Clyde Shelton
still in my city?

1158
01:34:07,802 --> 01:34:10,694
Now I refuse to believe,
that one man

1159
01:34:10,695 --> 01:34:15,772
is smarter than homeland
security, the FBI,

1160
01:34:15,773 --> 01:34:19,948
the Sheriffs Department,
or Philly PD.

1161
01:34:19,949 --> 01:34:21,719
I don't care how we do it,
or what kind of

1162
01:34:21,720 --> 01:34:24,775
obscure legal justification
we have to invoke.

1163
01:34:25,823 --> 01:34:27,857
I don't care what laws
we have to bend.

1164
01:34:27,858 --> 01:34:32,138
I am sure there is a provision
of the homeland security act

1165
01:34:32,139 --> 01:34:34,548
that we can activate.

1166
01:34:34,957 --> 01:34:38,173
Just get him out of here
by tomorrow.

1167
01:34:44,923 --> 01:34:45,807
Clyde.

1168
01:34:50,809 --> 01:34:51,812
Nick.

1169
01:34:53,217 --> 01:34:56,345
I wasn't expecting company.

1170
01:34:58,782 --> 01:35:01,655
Yeah, would've cleaned
up a little.

1171
01:35:01,656 --> 01:35:05,381
Never seen anybody
tunnel into prison before

1172
01:35:10,165 --> 01:35:14,304
And the solitary confinement
was clever.

1173
01:35:14,305 --> 01:35:18,202
Well that's how winners play.
We convince the other guy

1174
01:35:18,203 --> 01:35:20,616
he's making all the
right moves.

1175
01:35:21,406 --> 01:35:23,778
So did you ever catch
my accomplice?

1176
01:35:23,779 --> 01:35:28,329
Yeah, I did. It's the end
of the road for him now.

1177
01:35:32,455 --> 01:35:35,738
You played us, Clyde,
you played us real good.

1178
01:35:35,739 --> 01:35:38,253
Thank you. Yup.

1179
01:35:38,254 --> 01:35:40,342
Im glad you finally get
to appreciate

1180
01:35:40,343 --> 01:35:42,316
some of the effort I put
into all of this.

1181
01:35:42,317 --> 01:35:44,725
Well, you set out to
make a point, Clyde.

1182
01:35:44,726 --> 01:35:47,839
You made it.
- No, people still don't get it.

1183
01:35:47,840 --> 01:35:50,531
They dont appreciate what
I'm trying to say, Nick, but...

1184
01:35:50,532 --> 01:35:51,806
they will. Soon enough.

1185
01:35:51,807 --> 01:35:54,416
A man I cared about once
told me that we can't

1186
01:35:54,417 --> 01:35:56,512
retract the decisions that
we've made, we can only

1187
01:35:56,513 --> 01:35:59,171
affect the decisions we're
going to make from here.

1188
01:35:59,172 --> 01:36:00,618
What, are you trying
to save me now, Nick?

1189
01:36:00,619 --> 01:36:03,947
I'm giving you a way out.
Big difference.

1190
01:36:03,948 --> 01:36:05,767
Stand up for those principles
you've been preaching,

1191
01:36:05,768 --> 01:36:09,570
we're all held accountable
Clyde, that includes you.

1192
01:36:09,571 --> 01:36:12,282
Why don't we do
the right thing here.

1193
01:36:12,283 --> 01:36:15,129
I'm doing the
right thing, Nick.

1194
01:36:17,003 --> 01:36:18,910
You just have to see
it that way.

1195
01:36:18,911 --> 01:36:20,894
By murdering all those
people, all you're doing is

1196
01:36:20,895 --> 01:36:22,887
destroying the memory
of your daughter.

1197
01:36:22,888 --> 01:36:26,580
And causing the same pain
that you're suffering from.

1198
01:36:33,508 --> 01:36:36,160
So what do you suggest, Nick?

1199
01:36:36,161 --> 01:36:38,152
Make another deal?

1200
01:36:38,153 --> 01:36:41,181
One final offer,
is that what it is?

1201
01:36:44,319 --> 01:36:48,134
I don't make deals with
murderers anymore, Clyde.

1202
01:36:48,135 --> 01:36:50,064
You taught me that.

1203
01:36:54,543 --> 01:36:59,193
Finally.
- Finally.

1204
01:37:00,709 --> 01:37:03,450
Well done. Bravo.

1205
01:37:03,451 --> 01:37:06,739
Maybe I wasnt such a
bad teacher after all.

1206
01:37:06,740 --> 01:37:07,948
If you go through
with this, Clyde,

1207
01:37:07,949 --> 01:37:09,509
it's a decision you will
have to live with

1208
01:37:09,510 --> 01:37:11,614
for the rest of your life.

1209
01:37:34,918 --> 01:37:37,023
I'm sorry, Nick.

1210
01:37:39,916 --> 01:37:41,533
Me too.

1211
01:37:52,418 --> 01:37:54,607
Like I said, Clyde, it's a
decision you will have to

1212
01:37:54,608 --> 01:37:57,685
live with for the rest
of your life.

1213
01:37:57,686 --> 01:38:00,972
Which I figure by now is
about 25 more seconds.

1214
01:38:55,969 --> 01:38:59,558
"DADDY"
