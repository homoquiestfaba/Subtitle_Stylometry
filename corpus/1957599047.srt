00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:03,960

2
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:16,200
(suspenseful music)

3
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:28,080
(electrical fizzling)

4
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:33,960
(suspenseful tempo music)

5
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:31,120
(suspenseful beat music)

6
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,520
- [Woman] That all right?

7
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,520
- Yeah!

8
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:50,000
It feels good so far!

9
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:53,440
(upbeat music)

10
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,720
You really think this will work?

11
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:59,240
- Baby, it'll work.

12
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:02,120
It's your show.

13
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:05,440
What do you want?

14
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,760
- I don't know.

15
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,960
What do you got?

16
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:17,560
(faint singing)

17
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:22,600

18
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,680

25
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,200
- Whoa!

26
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,000
Stop!

27
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,040
Ow, whoa, stop it!

28
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,720
(ominous music)

29
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,400
- What's wrong, lover?

30
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,680
(electrical whooshing)

31
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:52,600
- What the hell happened?

32
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:53,800
Why did you cut in?

33
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,800
- You had a palpitation increase.

34
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,120
Something scare you?

35
00:02:59,040 --> 00:02:59,840
How was it?

36
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:02,280
- I liked it.

37
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,080
(woman laughing)

38
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:06,160
Atmospherics were tight,
motion was naturalistic.

39
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:08,440
And, yeah, Valery was hot.

40
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:09,920
- White's getting impatient.

41
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,480
Conference room?

42
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:12,280
- Five minutes.

43
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:16,680
(woman giggling)

44
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,920
The host, Valery, how'd you do that?

45
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:21,200
She looked like this girl
I nailed in high school.

46
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:24,120
- Well, I referenced your
high school year book,

47
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,920
pulled all the atmospherics off it.

48
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,120
- All right, the sound.

49
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,080
Did you tweak the amplitude settings?

50
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:31,600
- Self-induced neural transference.

51
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,040
You were really feeling it.

52
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,080
- Hey, don't get cute and
play around with the settings

53
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:37,840
while my ass is sitting
in the chair, you got me?

54
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,720
- Sure, Lou, it's your show.

55
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:41,840
- Looks medieval.

56
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:49,320
Two people are gonna have sex
with this thing and enjoy it?

57
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:51,040
- Virtual sex, sir.

58
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,720
And, yes, they'll both enjoy it.

59
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:53,760
- All right.

60
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,040
I want the program ready in one week.

61
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:58,000
- It can't be done, we
just finished dry runs.

62
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,160
- We have to screen for applicants

63
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:01,160
and put them through exams.

64
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:02,440
- Well run the tests on yourselves.

65
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:03,680
Be your own guinea pigs.

66
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:06,520
If Virtucom can be traded
publicly by this quarter's end,

67
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:09,000
we'll have a heap of
funding by next quarter.

68
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,960
- We shouldn't railroad
this into production

69
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,600
without complete testing.

70
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:15,360
We could overlook other
possible applications.

71
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,160
- Such as?

72
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,880
- What if the VR program
could be used to help

73
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:20,720
those with sexual
problems or dysfunctions?

74
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,680
- Sex is entertainment.

75
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:23,840
Sex is profit.

76
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:24,840
- Amen, Pick.

77
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Nice thoughts, Miss Tessia,

78
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
but I just wanna have
people put our headsets on,

79
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,960
sit back and let them dry hump
us all the way to the bank.

80
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:36,120
(White chuckling)

81
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:38,080
All right, you got one week.

82
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,520
Can you handle it?

83
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,600
Or do I bring in designers who can?

84
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,000
- We can handle it.

85
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,840
We'll have it ready for you next week.

86
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:46,000
- Good.

87
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,200
Because I've already picked the city

88
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,960
where we will launch our program.

89
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:52,000
- Las Vegas, what a joke.

90
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
- That's the call, Sharon.

91
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,320
Now White and Pickford set up a deal

92
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,320
with the Plaza Hotel downtown.

93
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:59,080
Call them up, talk to a guy
named Kevin Pallone, okay?

94
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:01,120
Look, Sharon, Las Vegas
makes perfect sense.

95
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,760
- What are we making
here, the digital hooker?

96
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:05,000
(Lou chuckling)

97
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,720

- Thanks.

102
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,040
We'll call.

- You look at the file I sent you?

106
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:42,960
- Yeah, I can bring it
up for you right now.

107
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,600
- I don't need to see that, Kevin.

108
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:49,760
Only your department of Vincent
Attractions is losing money

109
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:52,920
and it's really simple.

110
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,120
Guests gamble.

111
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,440
They see the shows and
they gamble some more,

112
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:59,080
spending all their time and money here.

113
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:01,480
- I know how it works, I do
have something coming in.

114
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03,440
A virtual pleasures program.

115
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,920
A company from LA is gonna bring it out

116
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,280
and let us test drive.

117
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:09,520
- Well I don't care if they
light their farts on fire.

118
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,640
Just fill these seats.

119
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:12,440
All of them!

120
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,560
Pack the place, Kevin,
or pack up your office.

121
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:21,000
(melancholy music)

122
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,200

(computer beeping)

125
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:41,640
- Well, you'll need to take
your glasses off for this.

126
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:43,480
- It feels weird already.

127
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,560
- So, Leah, it says here you're looking

128
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,800
for a tropical fantasy.

129
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:49,600
- Yeah.

130
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:53,400
- I think you're gonna like it.

131
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:56,480

132
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:01,680

133
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:02,480
Engage.

- Don't forget your glasses.

154
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,160
- Thanks.

155
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:54,760
Need me to do it again?

156
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,160
(Lou chuckling)

157
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,200
- We'll let you know.

158
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:02,720
(exciting beat music)

159
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:08,760

163
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,480
White and Pickford are happy.

164
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:42,800
I hear they're talking about
bonuses and stock options

165
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:43,920
for both of us.

166
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,440
- We're going too fast.

167
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,200
Something will trip us up.

168
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,960
We need to slow down and
keep the testers around

169
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:52,200
for a full numerological examination.

170
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:55,360
- We start the onsites in
Las Vegas in three days.

171
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:58,120
- Lou, I'm talking about
people's health here.

172
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:59,160
- People don't care about their health,

173
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,200
they wanna feel good.

174
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:02,240
Look, the company's throwing a party

175
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,040
at White's house tomorrow night.

176
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,800
You really should try and attend.

177
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,160
- Okay.

178
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:09,960
- We're building a
virtual reality attraction

179
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:13,760
that is gonna make you and me and Virtucom

180
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,640
an embarrassing amount of money.

181
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:19,040
You still with me all the way on this?

182
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:20,760
- Yeah, I'm with you.

183
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:23,480

188
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:54,880
- Sharon, what is this?

189
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,960
- Valery took the night off.

190
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:59,080
Thought I'd give you a special present.

191
00:11:59,080 --> 00:11:59,880
Me.

192
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:01,600
(Lou chuckling)

193
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,200
- Sharon, this isn't right.

194
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,680
- Oh, it's more than right.

195
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:06,000
It's perfect.

196
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Your favorite car, favorite music.

197
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,160
Favorite assistant.

198
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,040
We built this, you and I.

199
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,640
Now let's enjoy it.

- Miss Tessia?

237
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:45,040
You brought in Mr. Burke?

238
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,160
- Is he gonna be okay?

239
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,160
- Unfortunately, it doesn't look good.

240
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:53,720
Neurological scans show brain
trauma, possible damage.

241
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:54,520
- Oh my God.

242
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:57,120
- But his seizures have stopped

243
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,800
and we have him stabilized for now.

244
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:02,200
Hopefully he'll wake up
and tell us what happened.

245
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,000
- I hope so.

246
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,920
- The last thing he does
remember is driving to Virtucom

247
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:12,440
and having sex with a woman named Valery.

248
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:13,480
- That's impossible.

249
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:15,520
I found him in the supermarket parking lot

250
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:17,040
10 blocks from here.

251
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:19,920
He looked terrible, so
I put him in my car.

252
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:22,080
- Well, he's lucky to be alive

253
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:24,760
and he has you to thank for that.

254
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:26,360
(shredder buzzing)

255
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:29,160

(Pickford chattering)

258
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:02,800
- Soon as the appointment gets finished,

259
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:03,880
we'll get over there.

260
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:06,160
- [White] Yeah, good, good.

261
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:07,320
- Good morning, Sharon.

262
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:09,080
I was just telling White here that

263
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:11,120
you and Burke just about
finished the VR testing.

264
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,960
- Mmmm.
- Congratulations, Sharon.

265
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:15,240
Sorry we pinched the clock on you.

266
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:17,520
We relied on your ability
to get it ready in time.

267
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:18,320
- Thank you.

268
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,480
- By the way, have you
seen Burke this morning?

269
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:21,160
He's supposed to be here for a meeting.

270
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:23,080
- No, I haven't.

271
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:25,080
(ominous music)
- Is there a problem, Sharon?

272
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:25,880
- No, why?

273
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:27,240
- Miss Tessia?

274
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:29,920
Is something wrong with the VR testing?

275
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:31,080
Well?

276
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:32,800
Do we have a problem?

277
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,120
- I think it's covered.

278
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:35,120
A little hangup with the sync codes.

279
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,360
Should be fine now.

280
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:37,920
- Oh, good.

281
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:40,000
Come on, Pick, we'll start without Burke.

282
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:44,080

283
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:46,520

- Can we have your attention?

290
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:10,200
Here comes the good news.

291
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,800
Pick any year,

292
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:14,800
from the ice age to the space age,

293
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,280
whatever your desires,

294
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:19,680
the Virtucom VR sex
program gives customers

295
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:23,480
a safe, customized and
gratifying sexual experience.

296
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:26,720
Imagine sex anytime,

297
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,400
anywhere you want it

298
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:31,320
with no risk of pregnancy
or transmitted diseases.

299
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:34,040
Of course, every VR unit will be checked

300
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:36,760
for computer viruses, so--

301
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:39,320
- We need to talk, now!

302
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:41,440
- Sharon, I'm in the middle
of a presentation here.

303
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:44,080
- Do you want me to make a presentation?

304
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:46,880
(ominous music)

305
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:47,880
- Excuse me.

306
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:52,040
(people chattering)

307
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,600
- Burke's galvinate
impulses were calibrated.

308
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:58,160
I don't know why the program overrides

309
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,520
didn't kick in sooner.

310
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:00,640
- Sharon, your timing is awful.

311
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:03,360
- Look, I tried to tell you earlier.

312
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:04,160
- Well,

313
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:07,160
we can kiss Vegas and the next
production quarter goodbye.

314
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,160
We were doing so well.

315
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,240
- Hey, I didn't build this thing alone.

316
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:13,400
This is you, me, Virtucom, everybody.

317
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:15,880
- What are we all supposed to
do now, scrap the whole thing?

318
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:18,160
What do I tell the
investors, our contractors?

319
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,200
- The truth.

320
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,880
That Virtucom needs more testing

321
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:23,480
to make sure it's absolutely safe.

322
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:26,200
Our VR sex program put
a guy in the hospital.

323
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:29,040
- No, Sharon, you put
a guy in the hospital.

324
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:31,920
(sinister music)

325
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,360
Sorry about that.

326
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:40,560
(electronic fizzling)

327
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:54,560
(computer chiming)

328
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:01,560
Didn't mean to come off
like an asshole last night.

329
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:04,280
We're hall under a heap of pressure here.

330
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:05,880
Any word on Burke?

331
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,360
- No change.

332
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:08,880
Still in ICU.

333
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:11,200
However,

334
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:14,240
I've fixed the galvanick inlays

335
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,120
so they won't go ballistic again.

336
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:19,240
Came in early this morning,
wrote new inlay codes.

337
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:22,160
It was simple to fix,
only took me 15 minutes.

338
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,400
See here?

339
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:26,800
When the inlay sends a
respiratory or cardio increase,

340
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:29,920
this flow circuit automatically opens up.

341
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:33,000
- Which means the VR users
won't cook their bacon.

342
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,800
- I've backed up the fail
safe with a shadow program.

343
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,080
- You did good work, Sharon.

344
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,120
And you're fired.

345
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,280
- You're serious?
(ominous music)

346
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:47,280
- This is your last monthly plus severance

347
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,800
and your share of Virtucom stock options.

348
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:52,440
I'll take the VR sex
protect to Las Vegas myself

349
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:54,680
and find a new assistant on site.

350
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:56,040
- This is my work.

351
00:19:57,680 --> 00:20:00,000
Virtucom is using my VR patent.

352
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
You can't just cut me loose

353
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,800
because of what happened to Burke!

354
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:04,720
- And what if Burke dies, Sharon?

355
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:05,520
Then what?

356
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,080
- I don't know.

357
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,360
I pray that he doesn't.

358
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:13,080
- This is your mess and this
is how we're gonna clear it up.

359
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:14,120
- Right.

360
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:18,000
And you get to keep my VR
patents while I take the bullet.

361
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,800
- That's the deal, Sharon, I'm sorry.

362
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:24,920
Oh, I've got a meeting.

363
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:26,160
Look, us the rest of the day

364
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:28,160
to clear your stuff out of the lab.

365
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:31,960
(ominous music)

366
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,000
(crickets chirping)

367
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:47,320
(somber music)

368
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:50,160
- The logins show Burke's
VR program start to slip

369
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:52,520
and the sensorium caused
palpitation increased

370
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:54,520
and neural receptive trauma.

371
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:56,080
- Burke might have had some hidden medical

372
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:59,200
or neurological condition
none of us knew about.

373
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,880
But it's fixed now.

374
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,040
- Why didn't you catch the slippage?

375
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:03,160
You were watching him, weren't you?

376
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:05,560
- I did step away for a minute.

377
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:07,960
Look, we're dealing with
a machine and a program

378
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:10,640
none of us fully understand yet.

379
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,480
I shouldn't have left Burke alone.

380
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:14,240
I made a mistake.

381
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,000
- A very costly one.

382
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,360
- You just fired me, why am I here?

383
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:20,840
(foreboding music)

384
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:21,960
- We may have been a but hasty

385
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:24,120
with our decision to terminate you.

386
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:26,840
- With respect to Burke's untimely demise,

387
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:30,640
we're obligated somehow to
put the program back on track.

388
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:32,520
- Should've thought of
that before you canned me

389
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:35,160
and tried to rip off
my VR program patents.

390
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:36,800
- What if we gave you patents back

391
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:38,240
and doubled you holdings in the company?

392
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,640
- It'd say you were desperate to debut

393
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:41,160
the VR sex program in Las Vegas.

394
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:45,120
- You're the only one besides
Burke who knows how to run it.

395
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:47,600
- Seems to be a question
of how bad you need me.

396
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:51,840
So,

397
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,960

415
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:11,000

to screen for applicants

00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,240
and put them through exams.

417

run the tests on yourselves.

Something will trip us up.

425
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:30,960
We need to slow down and
keep the testers around

426
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:33,240
for full neurological examinations.

427
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:35,360

Is he gonna be all right?

- [Doctor Voiceover] Unfortunately,
it doesn't look good.

Neurological scans show brain
trauma, possible damage.

00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:34,560
You are?

455
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:35,600
- Sharon Tessia.

456
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,000
I'm with Virtucom.

457
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,000

458
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,240
You get your room squared away?

459
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:40,480
- Everything's fine.

460
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:42,200
I'm ready to set up, could use a hand.

461
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:43,120
- Sure.

00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:45,080
(upbeat music)

463
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:46,520
Let's go.

464
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:47,400
Lounges,

465
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:48,200
swimming pools,

466
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:50,200
golf and tennis courts
aren't enough to compete

467
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:52,200
with the big houses anymore.

468
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:55,160
Every major casino has
some sort of water ride,

469
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:58,080
rollercoaster or amusement
park-type attraction.

470
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:59,600
Where do grownups go?

471
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:01,000
Like grownup games.

472
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,640
- Hmmm, let me guess,

473
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,520
card tables and slot machines?

474
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:06,000
- Obviously but they want more.

475
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,160
We give everything from Swedish rubdowns

476
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:10,280
to clay tennis courts but it's not enough.

477
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:12,760
As Vegas grows, real estate's gonna become

478
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:14,920
a serious, expensive issue

479
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:16,920
and virtual theme parks are the answer.

480
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:19,080
- Hmmm.

481
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:21,920
Don't worry, it won't bite
unless I program it to.

482
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,760
The chair and the headset
take on the sensual impulses

483
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:27,200
from this console.

484
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,320
As real as it may seem,

485
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:30,760
it's all just circuits and inlays.

486
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:32,120
- I have a girlfriend,

487
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:35,200
and Molly and I, we don't get too crazy.

488
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,560
Keep it in the bedroom, lights out.

489
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:39,080
- Okay.

490
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:40,240
Do you have a picture of her?

491
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:41,040
- Yeah.

492
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:44,120
Here.

493
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:47,000
- She's pretty.

494
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,240
You must feel lucky, huh?

495
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:50,520
- [Kevin] I suppose I am.

496
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:53,800
- The rodoscanner takes
two dimensional images

497
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:56,160
and replicates them into full dimension.

498
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:58,760
This is how we build the atmospherics.

499
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:00,160
Well,

500
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:01,480
what do you think?

501
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:02,280
Look good?

502
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:05,080
- I guess so.

503
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:08,360
- Okay, maybe you'd like to
try this with someone else.

504
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:10,000
(computer chiming)

505
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,480
See anything you like?

506
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:14,960
(computer buzzing)

507
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,160
Passion.

508
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:19,680
So, what would you and
Passion like to do for fun?

509
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:22,120
You know, kinky thrill sexcapades.

510
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:23,080
(Kevin chuckling)

511
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:25,000
- Like I said, I'm no lover boy but

512
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:29,040
I have always had this
fantasy about taking Molly

513
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,800
into the boss's office.

514
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:31,600
- Nappa's office?

515
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:34,000
(Sharon laughing)

516
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,040
I think I can work with that.

517
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:37,920
(Sharon giggling)

518
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:40,560
All right, Kevin, Passion's ready.

519
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:41,800
Are you?

520
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:44,520
(dramatic music)

521
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:56,880

526
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:15,520
(somber music)

527
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:16,600
- [Kevin] Oh.

528
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:20,360
- Hi, lover.

529
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:22,680
(phone ringing)
- Passion?

530
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:25,960
- Pick up the phone.

531
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:28,560
(phone ringing)

532
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:30,720
- Hello?

533
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,160
- [Nappa] Kevin, it's Nappa.

534
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:35,040
What the screw are you doing in my office?

535
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:36,640
- Shit.

536
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,880
I can't do this.

537
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:40,520
- Tell him you're busy.

538
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:44,680
- I can't talk, I'm busy.

539
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:49,240
(pleasant beat music)

540
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:16,200

541
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:28,440

546
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:29,640
- [Sharon] Well, what did you think?

547
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:31,160
(Kevin clearing throat)

548
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:32,600
- Thirsty.

549
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:35,880
(faint upbeat music)

550
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:38,120
- Bio-Virtual Transference.

551
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:40,040
You're hot and thirsty.

552
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:42,520
Feeling what you would've felt
if you were actually there.

553
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:45,920
The amount of transference
varies from user to user.

554
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:47,640
- This is gonna be huge.

555
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:49,000
- I wrote the program myself.

556
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,640
Coded all the atmospherics.

557
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:52,400
- It's brilliant.

558
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:55,280
Sharon, we'll give you whatever you need.

559
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:59,200
Advertising, promotion
support staff, anything.

560
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:01,400
We're gonna make a
killing with this thing.

561
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:06,200
(upbeat guitar music)

562
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:09,040
♪ Mom said, you better be a good girl ♪

563
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:12,040

565
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:17,920
- Long day, Kevin?

566
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:19,320
You're usually home before I am.

567
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:23,480
- I'm setting up a new
attraction at the casino.

568
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:25,640
How was your day?

569
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:26,920
- About like any other day.

570
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:31,120
Kevin, did you?

571
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:33,120
Your face.

572
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:37,080
Something in your eyes, like
you had sex or something.

573
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:38,080
- I did have sex.

574
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:40,400
With a machine.

575
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:42,000
Something new we're trying at the casino.

576
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
Virtual reality sex program.

577
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:44,800
- Oh yeah?

578
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:47,960
And who runs this virtual sex machine?

579
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:50,160
- The designer, the woman who built it.

580
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:51,160
- A woman?

581
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:55,040
(dramatic music)

582
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:17,520
(dramatic music)

583
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:25,280
- Come on, Molly.

584
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:26,280
It's just a machine.

585
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:28,080
It's like, I don't know,

586
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:29,400
if you used a machine like a vibrator.

587
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:31,280
- No, no, it is not the same thing

588
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:33,160
and I have never used one of those.

589
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:36,840
- Maybe you should start.

590
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:39,640
(Molly chuckling)

591
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:44,600
(dramatic music)

592
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:53,920
(computer beeping)

593
00:34:58,080 --> 00:35:01,040
(computer chiming)

594
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:12,360
(computer keys clicking)

595
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:15,360
- Kevin,

596
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:17,720
are you out of your freaking mind?

597
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:19,480
We can't come up with these numbers.

598
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:21,200
- Why not?

599
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:23,160
The casino is expanding the hotel suits

600
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:25,000
and adding a second gaming floor.

601
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,720
Lump it in with the renovation costs.

602
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:28,200
- Kevin, forget the cost.

603
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:30,440
What about the possible
litigation nightmare?

604
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:32,440
Can you imagine if some parent finds out

605
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:34,680
that their kid put the VR headset on?

606
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:37,600
- We'll ID everyone, verify their age.

607
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:38,400
- I don't like it.

608
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:40,080
What if some old-timer
tries the headset on

609
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:41,120
and dies of a stroke?

610
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:44,080
His family's gonna sue us for
millions and probably win.

611
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:45,960
- We'll cover ourselves with a waiver,

612
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:48,160
free us from liability.

613
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:49,280
- I don't know.

614
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:51,960
(Kevin sighing)

615
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:54,560
- Look, if this thing goes big,

616
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:55,920
and I think it will,

617
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:58,480
you're gonna be happy you spent the money.

618
00:35:58,480 --> 00:35:59,480
- And if it doesn't?

619
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:03,080
- Then I'm fired and you
can book old magicians

620
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:05,840
and washed-up lounge singers
for the rest of the summer.

621
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:07,800
- Hardly encouraging.

622
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:09,680
- Neither one of you has tried it.

623
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:11,000
Trust me!

624
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,280
One time with this this headset

625
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:14,120
is all the encouragement you need.

626
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:28,480

with your duel headset platform

630
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:37,240
and your operating system.

631
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:39,040
We'll ship it out to you tomorrow.

632
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:40,320
- Thanks, Leah.

633
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:42,320
So what's the word on Burke?

634
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:43,680
- No change.

635
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:44,960
Still in a coma.

636
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:47,320
And your story about finding
him in a parking lot,

637
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:48,720
it's losing water.

638
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:50,160
- If he never wakes up,

639
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:52,760
I don't know if any of
this will be worth it.

640
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:54,960
Call you when I get the
duel headset platforms.

641
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:55,760
- Okay,

642
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:56,560
bye.

643
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:08,120

644
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:14,400
(water bubbling)

645
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:17,920
- It looks like we're ready to roll.

646
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,560
- I'm gonna go to my room
and lay down for awhile.

647
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:22,960
I'll be back in an hour.

648
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:26,400

(electronic fizzling)

652
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:49,920
Most of the time, we'll use
pre-built fantasy constructs.

653
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:53,320
Things like location,
music, all atmospherics.

654
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:56,200
Makes the avatars react and
seem as if they were real.

655
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:57,520
- Ava-what?

656
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:58,560
- Avatars.

657
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:01,080
The virtual people inside of the program.

658
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:02,840
Broken down into pieces of information

659
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:06,320
that react to other avatars or
other pieces of information.

660
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:08,720
- So,

661
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:11,720
if you and me,

662
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:13,600
our avatars,

663
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:14,560
took a roll in the digital,

664
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:16,760
hey, that wouldn't be cheating, would it?

665
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:20,000
- And what would Molly think of that?

666
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,000
- Yeah.

667
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:26,440
I'm gonna get a drink at the
rival casino across the strip.

668
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:28,080
Wanna come?

669
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:29,920
- Shouldn't you be getting home?

670
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:31,040
- I'm a big boy.

671
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:32,600
Come on, Sharon, one drink.

672
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:34,560
Grab some dinner, maybe play Blackjack.

673
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:38,680
- I should stay and
give it another dry run.

674
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,320
- You've been in Vegas, what, a week?

675
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:44,920
You haven't seen anything yet.

676
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:45,880
Come on, my treat.

677
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:49,360
You showed me your world,
let me show you mine.

678
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:53,720
(exciting music)

679
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:59,160

(tires screeching)

684
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:33,640
Molly landed a job here first.

685
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:35,600
I came out six months later.

686
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:37,120
Looked around, didn't find much.

687
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:40,200
Sat on my ass for weeks.

688
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,560
Finally, a friend of Molly's

689
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:45,640
talked to somebody at the Plaza for me.

690
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:48,520
I wasn't computer
oriented but it was work.

691
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:52,000
Bullshitted my way through the interview

692
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:55,840
and here I am, booking
has-beens for the casino lounge.

693
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,000
I don't know.

694
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:01,800
Molly's happy, she has
friends here, but...

695
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:05,280
I feel stuck.

696
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:07,000
- Sounds like you're bored already.

697
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:13,640
- With what, the job or Molly?

698
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:14,720
(Sharon chuckling)

699
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:16,680
- I meant the job.

700
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:17,480
- Right.

701
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:19,360
I knew that.

702
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,800
(Kevin sighing)

703
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,200
All right, I'll admit it.

704
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:26,000
(Kevin laughing)

705
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,840
She's a cold fish.

706
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:31,440
(Sharon and Kevin laughing)

707
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:32,560
Nothing like Passion.

708
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:36,040
So,

709
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:37,560
what's your story?

710
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:39,080
- Don't have one.

711
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:39,960
- Come on.

712
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:41,920
How'd you end up doing what you do?

713
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:44,960
- I loved computers since I was a kid.

714
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:49,000
I studied program and
bio-tech engineering at Cal.

715
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,560
Worked the odd bio-tech job here and there

716
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:54,040
and then I get on the
research team at Virtucom.

717
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:56,360
- You involved?

718
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:58,120
Seeing anyone?

719
00:40:58,120 --> 00:40:59,480
- Kevin.

720
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:01,040
- Come on, you know my deal.

721
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,240
- Well,

722
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:06,720
I was seeing someone before
I came out here but it ended.

723
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:08,680
- What happened?

724
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:11,520
- Nothing, it just ended.

725
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:14,360
- [Kevin] Sounds like
it ended badly, right?

726
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:17,760
- I don't like to talk about it, Kevin.

727
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:19,840
- Sorry.

728
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:21,040

729
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:26,040

730
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:31,000
♪ Send me the night life ♪

731
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:33,920
- It's really beautiful, isn't it?

732
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:35,560
Especially at night with
the lights and everything.

733
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:37,360

By the way, you reek of alcohol.

770
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:41,720

781

Just need a little more sleep.

dinner, you and Sharon

783
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:13,000
went and worked on the

How bad it is it?

791
00:47:38,920 --> 00:47:41,080
- It's bad, we've got 10 or 15 minutes.

792
00:47:41,080 --> 00:47:42,480
- Shit, that's not a lot.

Burke's out of the coma.

893
01:01:07,120 --> 01:01:08,760

894

- But it's not good news.

895
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:11,800
He's completely catatonic.

896
01:01:11,800 --> 01:01:13,600
Won't look or talk to anybody.

897
01:01:13,600 --> 01:01:16,600

01:01:16,600 --> 01:01:17,840

899

to talk to you, Sharon.

900
01:01:19,880 --> 01:01:22,480
They know that Burke was here at Virtucom.

901
01:01:22,480 --> 01:01:24,240
- [Sharon] How did they find out?

902
01:01:24,240 --> 01:01:25,320
- Who knows?

903
01:01:25,320 --> 01:01:27,160
But they say that they'll
get a police summons

904
01:01:27,160 --> 01:01:29,800
if you don't cooperate immediately.

905
01:01:29,800 --> 01:01:32,520
We could be talking serious
assault charges here.

906
01:01:35,840 --> 01:01:37,320

01:03:07,040 --> 01:03:09,960
(ship whooshing)

922
01:03:19,560 --> 01:03:22,440
(gunfire popping)

923
01:03:22,440 --> 01:03:25,440
(adventurous music)

924
01:03:45,720 --> 01:03:49,040
(atmosphere whooshing)

925
01:03:53,440 --> 01:03:54,240
- Wow.

926
01:03:56,160 --> 01:03:59,160
(people chattering)

927
01:04:00,640 --> 01:04:03,680
(faint upbeat music)

928
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,720
(pleasant music)

929
01:04:16,360 --> 01:04:19,280
(computer chiming)

930
01:04:20,200 --> 01:04:21,240
- That's it.

931
01:04:21,240 --> 01:04:23,160
Our restoration move.

932
01:04:23,160 --> 01:04:24,840
- What's this, new program?

933
01:04:24,840 --> 01:04:26,400
- What?

934
01:04:26,400 --> 01:04:27,200
- That?

935
01:04:27,200 --> 01:04:28,120
I've never seen it on the VR menu.

936
01:04:28,120 --> 01:04:31,440
- Oh, old atmospherics
and inlay templates.

937
01:04:31,440 --> 01:04:32,240
- Who's Burke?

938
01:04:32,240 --> 01:04:34,200
- Are you going home now, Kevin?

939
01:04:34,200 --> 01:04:35,000
- Yeah.

940
01:04:36,040 --> 01:04:37,680
I'll see you in the morning.

941
01:04:37,680 --> 01:04:40,080
- Oh, I'm flying to LA.

942
01:04:40,080 --> 01:04:41,520
I'll be back late tomorrow.

943
01:04:42,840 --> 01:04:43,640
- Everything all right?

944
01:04:43,640 --> 01:04:45,240
- Oh, absolutely.

945
01:04:45,240 --> 01:04:47,920
Listen, I've seen you digging and learning

946
01:04:47,920 --> 01:04:49,360
your way around the machine.

947
01:04:49,360 --> 01:04:51,080
Think you can run it without me?

948
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:52,960
- Sure.

949
01:04:54,920 --> 01:04:55,720
Goodnight.

950
01:04:57,400 --> 01:05:00,160
(dramatic music)

951
01:05:02,480 --> 01:05:05,600
(airplane whooshing)

952
01:05:10,280 --> 01:05:12,800
- His insurance companies
hired a private investigator

953
01:05:12,800 --> 01:05:15,040
to find out exactly what
happened to Mr. Burke

954
01:05:15,040 --> 01:05:16,960
and who should pay for it.

955
01:05:16,960 --> 01:05:20,120
The man is unresponsive and withdrawn.

956
01:05:20,120 --> 01:05:22,080
And he's partially blind in his right eye.

957
01:05:22,080 --> 01:05:23,480
- All right.

958
01:05:23,480 --> 01:05:26,360
One, I'll take care of all
of Burke's hospital bills.

959
01:05:26,360 --> 01:05:28,960
And two, I get one shot at treating Burke,

960
01:05:28,960 --> 01:05:30,160
no questions asked.

961
01:05:30,160 --> 01:05:31,280
- You can't touch him.

962
01:05:31,280 --> 01:05:33,080
- Look, I'm a person of science,

963
01:05:33,080 --> 01:05:34,520
you're a person of medicine, right?

964
01:05:34,520 --> 01:05:36,760
- Well, I am a medical doctor

965
01:05:36,760 --> 01:05:38,680
and I don't really know who you are.

966
01:05:38,680 --> 01:05:40,240
- Well, it's obvious you've exhausted

967
01:05:40,240 --> 01:05:42,200
your medical means to treat him.

968
01:05:42,200 --> 01:05:44,440
- Admit it, you've tried everything.

969
01:05:44,440 --> 01:05:46,000
- Our attempts at treating Mr. Burke

970
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,120
are none of your concern.

971
01:05:48,120 --> 01:05:49,920
- Just say it for the sake of the patient,

972
01:05:49,920 --> 01:05:51,160
you've done all you can.

973
01:05:53,080 --> 01:05:56,000
- Well, we have tried everything, yes.

974
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:59,400
(heart monitor beeping)

975
01:06:01,560 --> 01:06:03,000
What exactly will that do?

976
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:04,400
- We're going to install
a medicinal program.

977
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:06,520
- It's like a virtual doctor.

978
01:06:08,080 --> 01:06:09,920
- Okay, look, I'm gonna finish my rounds

979
01:06:09,920 --> 01:06:12,680
and if he reacts adversely
to the treatment,

980
01:06:12,680 --> 01:06:14,040
you call me immediately.

981
01:06:14,040 --> 01:06:15,920
I don't think I need to go
into what'll happen to us

982
01:06:15,920 --> 01:06:17,320
if this doesn't work.

983
01:06:17,320 --> 01:06:19,920
- Doctor, don't you wanna see?

984
01:06:23,720 --> 01:06:26,400
(dramatic music)

985
01:06:54,160 --> 01:06:57,080
(computer chiming)

986
01:07:11,400 --> 01:07:14,480
(faint upbeat music)

987
01:07:22,520 --> 01:07:24,000
- [Kevin] Hey, how was LA?

988
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:25,920
- [Sharon] Fine, how
did everything go here?

989
01:07:25,920 --> 01:07:27,120
- Piece of cake.

990
01:07:27,120 --> 01:07:29,200
I installed the duel chair platform myself

991
01:07:29,200 --> 01:07:31,040
and hooked it into the sensorial.

992
01:07:31,040 --> 01:07:32,040
- What?

993
01:07:32,040 --> 01:07:33,440
You imprinted it without me?

994
01:07:33,440 --> 01:07:35,040
- White and Pickford wanted
to get it on the floor

995
01:07:35,040 --> 01:07:36,040
as soon as possible.

996
01:07:36,040 --> 01:07:38,800
- Oh, so you're talking to Virtucom now.

997
01:07:38,800 --> 01:07:42,040
(ominous music)
- Sharon, I know about Burke.

998
01:07:42,040 --> 01:07:44,160
I know how he really
ended up in the hospital.

999
01:07:44,160 --> 01:07:46,640
See, you might have gotten
rid of his VR program

1000
01:07:46,640 --> 01:07:48,080
but when the program malfunctions,

1001
01:07:48,080 --> 01:07:50,040
it leaves behind a vitals template.

1002
01:07:50,040 --> 01:07:53,600
Your little secret just
got very expensive to keep.

1003
01:07:53,600 --> 01:07:55,120
- White and Pickford?

1004
01:07:55,120 --> 01:07:56,320
- Know everything, they're in my corner.

1005
01:07:56,320 --> 01:07:59,000
- Oh, so you're the new errand boy?

1006
01:08:00,760 --> 01:08:02,320
They want my program, right?

1007
01:08:02,320 --> 01:08:03,240
- For starters?

1008
01:08:05,120 --> 01:08:06,840
The rest depends.

1009
01:08:06,840 --> 01:08:10,400
What's a prison sentence worth to you?

1010
01:08:10,400 --> 01:08:11,560
- You are scum.

1011
01:08:12,400 --> 01:08:14,400
(ominous music)

1012
01:08:14,400 --> 01:08:15,560
- [Kevin] Molly!

1013
01:08:15,560 --> 01:08:17,320
- Kevin, what're you doing?

1014
01:08:17,320 --> 01:08:19,040
- Molly, we're just--

1015
01:08:19,040 --> 01:08:20,200
- I come in here wanting to see

1016
01:08:20,200 --> 01:08:22,160
what's been keeping you
here late every night.

1017
01:08:22,160 --> 01:08:24,920
Now I see what, or who, it is.

1018
01:08:24,920 --> 01:08:28,480
- I'm Sharon Tessia, I designed
the virtual attraction.

1019
01:08:29,480 --> 01:08:31,160
Molly, really, don't get confused.

1020
01:08:31,160 --> 01:08:33,480
Kevin and I only work together.

1021
01:08:35,880 --> 01:08:38,960
- Well, what about this
sex machine thingy?

1022
01:08:38,960 --> 01:08:39,760
- What?

1023
01:08:39,760 --> 01:08:42,000
Kevin hasn't told you
about Virtual Pleasures?

1024
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:43,880
- Not in detail, no.

1025
01:08:43,880 --> 01:08:45,800
- Maybe you should give it a try.

1026
01:08:45,800 --> 01:08:46,840
(ominous music)

1027
01:08:46,840 --> 01:08:48,560
In fact, why don't you both sit

1028
01:08:48,560 --> 01:08:50,920
in the new duel chair platform?

1029
01:08:50,920 --> 01:08:52,160
Try it out together.

1030
01:08:52,160 --> 01:08:52,960
- Sharon, I don't think that's a--

1031
01:08:52,960 --> 01:08:54,000
- Yeah, Kevin.

1032
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,680
Let's see this sex machine gizmo

1033
01:08:56,680 --> 01:08:57,600
that you've been building with

1034
01:08:57,600 --> 01:09:00,120
your very attractive coworker.

1035
01:09:00,120 --> 01:09:02,720
(ominous music)

1036
01:09:02,720 --> 01:09:03,840
- Just relax, Molly.

1037
01:09:03,840 --> 01:09:05,000
Enjoy the ride.

1038
01:09:06,840 --> 01:09:08,160
Besides,

1039
01:09:08,160 --> 01:09:10,120
Kevin trusts me, don't you?

1040
01:09:10,120 --> 01:09:11,120
- Yeah.

1041
01:09:11,120 --> 01:09:12,080
- Of course you do.

1042
01:09:13,080 --> 01:09:14,920
Let's see.

1043
01:09:14,920 --> 01:09:17,000
How about the office program?

1044
01:09:18,480 --> 01:09:19,800
What do you say, Kevin?

1045
01:09:19,800 --> 01:09:20,640
Sound good?

1046
01:09:22,280 --> 01:09:25,600
(electronic whooshing)

1047
01:09:27,160 --> 01:09:28,120
- Oh my God, Kevin.

1048
01:09:29,480 --> 01:09:32,080
I can feel you, can you feel me?

1049
01:09:32,080 --> 01:09:33,520
- Yeah.

1050
01:09:33,520 --> 01:09:36,240
(pleasant music)

1051
01:09:37,440 --> 01:09:39,200
- You didn't do this with her, did you?

1052
01:09:39,200 --> 01:09:41,680
I mean, in here?

1053
01:09:41,680 --> 01:09:44,720
- I already told you,
I was in here with you.

1054
01:09:44,720 --> 01:09:46,120
- Okay.

1055
01:09:46,120 --> 01:09:48,200
Sorry I was such a crank about her.

1056
01:09:48,200 --> 01:09:50,600
She is kinda pretty, you know.

1057
01:09:50,600 --> 01:09:53,520
(computer buzzing)

1058
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:01,880
(pleasant music)

1059
01:10:22,360 --> 01:10:25,280
(computer chiming)

1060
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:29,800
(intense music)

1061
01:10:46,960 --> 01:10:50,080
(computer keys typing)

1062
01:10:51,400 --> 01:10:54,080
(dramatic music)

1063
01:11:25,680 --> 01:11:28,280
(ominous music)

1064
01:11:32,840 --> 01:11:35,920
(intense beat music)

1065
01:12:34,280 --> 01:12:37,360
(intense beat music)

1066
01:12:50,360 --> 01:12:53,560
(exciting beat music)

1067
01:13:32,320 --> 01:13:35,520
(exciting beat music)

1068
01:14:10,320 --> 01:14:13,120
(Molly huffing)

1069
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:18,800
Kevin?

1070
01:14:23,880 --> 01:14:26,400
(somber music)

1071
01:14:29,440 --> 01:14:32,640
(electrical fizzling)

1072
01:14:36,040 --> 01:14:36,840
- Molly?

1073
01:14:38,320 --> 01:14:41,120
(ominous music)

1074
01:14:48,720 --> 01:14:50,800
Molly, please, I don't know what happened.

1075
01:14:50,800 --> 01:14:52,720
I woke up in the hotel
room, my clothes were gone.

1076
01:14:52,720 --> 01:14:54,200
Keys, wallet, everything.

1077
01:14:55,920 --> 01:14:56,800
Molly, come on!

1078
01:14:56,800 --> 01:14:58,400
I had no idea Sharon
was gonna pull that crap

1079
01:14:58,400 --> 01:15:00,240
with the VR program.

1080
01:15:00,240 --> 01:15:03,040
Will you just stop and
listen to me for a second?

1081
01:15:03,040 --> 01:15:05,360
- You think you and your
little sex computer's funny?

1082
01:15:05,360 --> 01:15:08,160
That kinky coworker
slobbering all over me, ugh.

1083
01:15:08,160 --> 01:15:09,840
- It was just a game, a simulation.

1084
01:15:11,080 --> 01:15:11,880
- A game?

1085
01:15:11,880 --> 01:15:12,680
It sure didn't feel like a game

1086
01:15:12,680 --> 01:15:14,600
and it definitely wasn't a
game when I woke up alone

1087
01:15:14,600 --> 01:15:16,000
and you woke up in a hotel!

1088
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:19,120
- She must've cut in somehow
and kept the VR program going.

1089
01:15:19,120 --> 01:15:20,240
- Right, you're a creep, Kevin.

1090
01:15:20,240 --> 01:15:21,960
Stay the hell away from me.

1091
01:15:23,080 --> 01:15:26,080
(somber beat music)

1092
01:15:39,720 --> 01:15:40,520
- Excuse me.

1093
01:15:40,520 --> 01:15:43,080
I need a business suit
with a modem and T-1 lines.

1094
01:15:43,080 --> 01:15:44,080
- Sure.

1095
01:15:47,760 --> 01:15:48,800
- Kevin,

1096
01:15:48,800 --> 01:15:50,080
we have customers waiting.

1097
01:15:50,080 --> 01:15:52,080
You have empty VR chairs,
what's the problem?

1098
01:15:52,080 --> 01:15:53,080
- Sharon.

1099
01:15:53,080 --> 01:15:55,120
She's reprogrammed the VR
access codes by remote.

1100
01:15:55,120 --> 01:15:56,240
I can't turn it on.
(phone ringing)

1101
01:15:56,240 --> 01:15:57,440
- How long have they been down?

1102
01:15:57,440 --> 01:15:58,880
- All morning.

1103
01:15:58,880 --> 01:16:01,040
(phone ringing)

1104
01:16:01,040 --> 01:16:01,960
Hello?

1105
01:16:05,040 --> 01:16:05,840
Funny.

1106
01:16:05,840 --> 01:16:09,040
Reprogram and give me access
to the VR console right now

1107
01:16:09,040 --> 01:16:11,800
or we go to the police
with Burke's accident.

1108
01:16:11,800 --> 01:16:13,720
- Go tell them we're taking care of it.

1109
01:16:15,800 --> 01:16:17,440
Where are you Sharon?

1110
01:16:17,440 --> 01:16:20,000
- Nappa, I'm not
surprised you got into bed

1111
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:21,040
with White and Pickford.

1112
01:16:21,040 --> 01:16:23,240
- Sharon, be smart about this.

1113
01:16:23,240 --> 01:16:25,320
We hold incriminating information.

1114
01:16:25,320 --> 01:16:27,120
You hold the VR program patents.

1115
01:16:28,480 --> 01:16:30,480
It's that simple.

1116
01:16:30,480 --> 01:16:33,720
- Stealing is simple,
even for patsies like you.

1117
01:16:33,720 --> 01:16:37,280
The VR machine stays off
today, all day, all week.

1118
01:16:37,280 --> 01:16:40,640
I'll turn it back on when
you guys start playing fair.

1119
01:16:40,640 --> 01:16:42,000
- [Nappa] Sharon!

1120
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:43,800
(dial tone buzzing)

1121
01:16:43,800 --> 01:16:45,080
- [Kevin] Well?

1122
01:16:45,080 --> 01:16:48,480
- Can you get access to the
VR program without her or not?

1123
01:16:48,480 --> 01:16:49,920
(phone ringing)
- With an extra CPU

1124
01:16:49,920 --> 01:16:52,400
and data drives, I may have a shot.

1125
01:16:52,400 --> 01:16:54,560
(phone ringing)
- Get started.

1126
01:16:54,560 --> 01:16:55,680
Hello?

1127
01:16:55,680 --> 01:16:57,480
- Our arrangement stays the same.

1128
01:16:57,480 --> 01:17:01,440
If Kevin can download the
VR systems and programs,

1129
01:17:01,440 --> 01:17:04,680
I don't see any more need
for Miss Tessia's services.

1130
01:17:04,680 --> 01:17:05,680
- I'll make a call.

1131
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:09,800
- Make it clean, no mistake,
she's a slippery fish.

1132
01:17:10,880 --> 01:17:12,360
- Don't worry about it.

1133
01:17:12,360 --> 01:17:15,080
(ominous music)

1134
01:17:15,080 --> 01:17:18,280
(heart monitor beeping)

1135
01:17:22,280 --> 01:17:25,200
(computer chiming)

1136
01:17:43,440 --> 01:17:46,640
(ominous tempo music)

1137
01:17:54,600 --> 01:17:57,120
(somber music)

1138
01:18:04,400 --> 01:18:07,280
(computer beeping)

1139
01:18:09,840 --> 01:18:11,040
How's it coming?

1140
01:18:11,040 --> 01:18:12,000
- We're downloading.

1141
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:14,120
In about an hour I should
have the whole program files

1142
01:18:14,120 --> 01:18:15,880
and the sensoriams maximum.

1143
01:18:15,880 --> 01:18:17,840
- Call me when you got the whole thing.

1144
01:18:19,080 --> 01:18:22,160
(foreboding music)

1145
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:31,760
(computer beeping)

1146
01:18:31,760 --> 01:18:33,960
- Kevin, you little snake.

1147
01:18:40,240 --> 01:18:43,160
(foreboding music)

1148
01:18:49,880 --> 01:18:52,880
(suspenseful music)

1149
01:19:02,680 --> 01:19:06,080
(slot machine cranking)

1150
01:19:13,160 --> 01:19:14,920
(computer beeping)

1151
01:19:14,920 --> 01:19:17,920
(suspenseful music)

1152
01:19:28,800 --> 01:19:32,320
(computer chiming)

1153
01:19:32,320 --> 01:19:35,320
(suspenseful music)

1154
01:19:58,560 --> 01:20:01,520
(door thudding)

1155
01:20:01,520 --> 01:20:04,120
(ominous music)

1156
01:20:07,200 --> 01:20:08,960
- Too late, Sharon,

1157
01:20:08,960 --> 01:20:11,400
but you had to go and play
games with the access codes.

1158
01:20:11,400 --> 01:20:12,440
Now you have nothing.

1159
01:20:15,240 --> 01:20:18,720
(ominous music)

1160
01:20:18,720 --> 01:20:22,040
- Sharon, please, you're
in the middle of a casino.

1161
01:20:22,840 --> 01:20:24,560
My casino.

1162
01:20:24,560 --> 01:20:26,880
I could have security
in here in a heartbeat.

1163
01:20:29,360 --> 01:20:30,760
Finish downloading.

1164
01:20:30,760 --> 01:20:33,880
I'm getting security and
you do what you have to do.

1165
01:20:33,880 --> 01:20:36,040
(gunshot booming)

1166
01:20:36,040 --> 01:20:39,240
(intense music)

1167
01:20:39,240 --> 01:20:42,480
- [Guard] Let's go, let's
go, let's go, let's go!

1168
01:20:42,480 --> 01:20:44,320
- Next time, I won't miss.

1169
01:20:44,320 --> 01:20:47,720
Now Kevin, unhook your data
drives from my VR deck.

1170
01:20:47,720 --> 01:20:49,080
- And destroy your own machine?

1171
01:20:49,080 --> 01:20:50,280
- Better me than you.

1172
01:20:50,280 --> 01:20:52,080
Now unhook them now.

1173
01:20:53,880 --> 01:20:56,480
(ominous music)

1174
01:21:02,560 --> 01:21:04,000
(gunshot booming)
(man groaning)

1175
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:05,920
(people screaming)

1176
01:21:05,920 --> 01:21:08,920
(suspenseful music)

1177
01:21:13,120 --> 01:21:15,920
(gunshot booming)

1178
01:21:19,240 --> 01:21:20,040
- Don't move, sir!

1179
01:21:20,040 --> 01:21:21,760
- I'm George Nappa, casino owner!

1180
01:21:21,760 --> 01:21:23,600
That woman is a thief and a murderer!

1181
01:21:23,600 --> 01:21:25,280
- [Guard] We'll sort it out
when the police get here.

1182
01:21:29,720 --> 01:21:31,160
- [Announcer] Casino owner George Nappa

1183
01:21:31,160 --> 01:21:33,840
has been taken into custody
and held for questioning.

1184
01:21:35,200 --> 01:21:37,800
The authorities may finally have the goods

1185
01:21:37,800 --> 01:21:41,160
on the very famous mob boss.
(upbeat music)

1186
01:21:41,160 --> 01:21:43,960
(phone ringing)

1187
01:21:45,600 --> 01:21:46,480
- Hello?

1188
01:21:46,480 --> 01:21:47,520
- Miss Tessia,

1189
01:21:47,520 --> 01:21:50,000
I've got some news for
you about Mr. Burke.

1190
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:51,360
He's fine.

1191
01:21:51,360 --> 01:21:52,280
(doctor chuckling)

1192
01:21:52,280 --> 01:21:53,080
Fully recovered.

1193
01:21:53,080 --> 01:21:55,560
We waltzed right on out
of here this morning.

1194
01:21:55,560 --> 01:21:57,280
- 100 percent?

1195
01:21:57,280 --> 01:22:00,200
No more lingering seizures
or synaptic traumas?

1196
01:22:00,200 --> 01:22:01,000
- None!

1197
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:03,320
He get full vision back
in his right eye too.

1198
01:22:03,320 --> 01:22:05,200
I am impressed.

1199
01:22:05,200 --> 01:22:08,080
Your virtual doctor did exactly
what you said it would do.

1200
01:22:09,080 --> 01:22:10,160
How did you do it?

1201
01:22:10,160 --> 01:22:12,120
- Doctor, remember our deal?

1202
01:22:13,560 --> 01:22:16,160
- Yeah, yeah, no questions.

1203
01:22:16,160 --> 01:22:17,320
- [Sharon] Thank you for
letting me treat him.

1204
01:22:17,320 --> 01:22:19,200
I'll call you when I get back.

1205
01:22:19,200 --> 01:22:20,840
- [Doctor] Bye, bye.
