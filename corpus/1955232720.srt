1
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:10,370
Yes! My high score!

2
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:13,179
Champion!

3
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:32,900
Oi.

4
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:35,891
Where do you think
you're going, young man?

5
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:38,892
Rome. I'm going to hold
my breath at the Olympics.

6
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:40,780
Hmm.

7
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:47,012
You better take this then,
hadn't you?

8
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:48,289
Put your medals in.

9
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:51,370
Thanks, Mum.
I gotta get going.

10
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:53,293
Have fun.

11
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:02,177
- Terry?
- What?

12
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:04,370
He's off to the
Olympics again.

13
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:31,060
Oi.

14
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:34,094
You gone mad?

15
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:36,455
I told Mum I'm going
to the Olympics.

16
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:39,532
I held my breath
for nearly 58 seconds.

17
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:42,489
Really? Well,
I tell you what.

18
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:44,972
Why don't you
jump in the van

19
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:47,016
and then me and you can hold
our breath all the way home?

20
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:48,931
That's about a minute away.

21
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:52,457
Eddie, look, all this
Olympic medal stuff,

22
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:54,337
it's driving me
a bit mad, mate.

23
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:56,530
Look at me. I'm driving about
in the middle of the night,

24
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:59,293
dark, freezing cold,
looking for you.

25
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:01,775
When I should be
at home doing what?

26
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:04,050
Watching
It's A Knockout, Dad?

27
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:05,369
Yeah.

28
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:08,179
<i>They're
carrying a tremendous log.</i>

29
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:09,579
<i>Come on. Come on.</i>

30
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:11,577
<i>Hurry up. Hurry up.</i>

31
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:15,536
Marbles one week,
holding your breath the next.

32
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:18,055
When is it all
gonna end, young man?

33
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:21,457
When I become
an Olympian.

34
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:23,371
Oh. I see.

35
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:24,808
Say goodnight
to your dad.

36
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:25,969
Night, Dad.

37
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:28,258
Night-night, son.

38
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:31,130
Night, Mum.
Night, love.

39
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:38,411
That's good
flexibility.

40
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:42,455
Great. Now, could you just
maybe flex your toes?

41
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:43,979
That's point your
toes towards you.

42
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:45,778
Good boy, thank you.

43
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:47,652
Now, you've got
to take it easy.

44
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:50,330
Don't do any
climbing up trees

45
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:52,888
and too much running around.
All right?

46
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:54,819
His knees are
still healing.

47
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:56,253
Okay.

48
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:06,419
Feel okay?

49
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:08,411
Good. Well done.

50
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:37,500
Ow!

51
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:47,052
Right, that's it!

52
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:51,814
Listen, enough is enough!

53
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:53,891
It's never bloody
ending with you, son.

54
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:56,020
Now you're gonna
come to work with me

55
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:57,971
and you're gonna learn to plaster.
All right?

56
00:04:58,060 --> 00:04:59,937
At least it might
keep you out of trouble.

57
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:02,329
What about
my Olympic preparations?

58
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:04,411
Eddie! You are
not an athlete!

59
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:17,132
Morning, Tel.
All right, Shirley?

60
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:19,415
Now, today I shall
be finishing off

61
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,013
an arctic stipple.

62
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:22,374
What did I just say?

63
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:23,694
Raspberry ripple?

64
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:26,897
No, not a raspberry ripple.
An arctic stipple.

65
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:29,170
Which is my
piece de resistance.

66
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:33,937
My plasterer's
trademark that you

67
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:36,693
shall spend all day
learning, young man.

68
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:38,930
Dad, you're a genius.

69
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:43,012
Oh, where's he gone now?

70
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:46,411
You're right, I'm never gonna go
to the Olympics.

71
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:49,213
I'm gonna go
to the Winter Olympics.

72
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:58,853
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

73
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:00,692
it gives me great pleasure
to introduce to you...

74
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:02,691
...the Head of the
British Winter Olympics

75
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:06,090
Selection Committee,
Mr. Dustin Target.

76
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:10,772
Thank you, George.

77
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:13,897
Good afternoon,
ladies and gentlemen.

78
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:16,210
Thank you so much
for being here...

79
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:18,774
...on this glorious day
for British sport.

80
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:22,610
You have entered
a new era for business...

81
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:27,057
...just as we have embarked
on a new era for sport.

82
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:31,454
Today it is my honor...

83
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:34,973
...and privilege,
to present to you...

84
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:38,531
...the 14 young men
who are all candidates

85
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:40,969
for the British Olympic
Downhill Team.

86
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:44,976
Vying for your sponsorship
and support...

87
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:47,051
...in achieving
their dreams...

88
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:53,377
...to reach the 1988
Winter Games in Calgary.

89
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:58,250
It's an opportunity
that requires

90
00:07:58,340 --> 00:07:59,978
a new kind of athlete...

91
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:03,811
...and you deserve the best...

92
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:06,171
...in return.

93
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:13,015
All right. Sorry. No, okay.
Hands up, that was my fault.

94
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:14,100
I'm sorry, fellas.

95
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:16,172
George. George.

96
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:21,011
Uh... More champagne, anyone?

97
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:23,854
Edwards, you've um...
You've made quite an impact today.

98
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:25,259
Oh, good,
I was trying to.

99
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:26,534
Yes. Um...

100
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:30,455
Look, I think we both
know that you've gone...

101
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:33,533
...as far as you can go
with the squad.

102
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:38,893
We shan't be selecting
you for the trials, I'm afraid.

103
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:42,213
But, um, keep up
with the training.

104
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:45,089
Aim for the
'92 Olympics.

105
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:46,620
Mr. Target, that's
in 5 years' time.

106
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:47,928
I'm ready now.

107
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:49,698
Um,
no, you're not.

108
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:51,413
You know, I've got
run times just as good

109
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:53,258
as any of that lot.
Yeah, well...

110
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:55,971
It's not all about speed.

111
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:59,215
It's about what school
you went to, is it?

112
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:02,298
Frankly, Eddie...

113
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:07,289
...you will never be
Olympic material.

114
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:11,935
Goodbye.

115
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:24,331
You wanna
get yourself qualified.

116
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:28,295
I mean it's not exactly
a career, is it? Skiing.

117
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:32,573
I mean, how much does a
downhill skier earn? Huh?

118
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:35,254
What's the take-home pay after tax?
Hmm?

119
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:38,419
Is there a pension?
I doubt it very much.

120
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:42,411
Get yourself qualified
for something useful, Eddie.

121
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:44,092
Yeah, all right, Dad.

122
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:46,339
I get the point.

123
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:49,089
You've been banging on
about it since I've been

124
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:51,614
out of nappies.
Sign me up.

125
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:57,019
Good lad.

126
00:09:57,780 --> 00:09:59,133
Good lad.

127
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:09,291
Made you
a nice cup of tea.

128
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:11,613
Thanks, Mum.

129
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:19,338
No more downhill, then?

130
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:26,018
Not exactly
a career, is it?

131
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:28,692
Not even for fun?

132
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:32,060
No.

133
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:36,653
It's about time
I started paying my way.

134
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:41,329
Well, you better
bring those

135
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:42,569
dirty overalls down,
then, hadn't you?

136
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:44,380
For the wash,
'cause you're gonna need them.

137
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:14,010
<i>Ski-jumping
is probably the most</i>

138
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:17,456
<i>spectacular of all
the alpine disciplines.</i>

139
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:20,890
<i>A majestic,
gravity defying mix of power...</i>

140
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:23,932
<i>...balance
and dare-devil courage.</i>

141
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:26,415
<i>And more than a few bruises.</i>

142
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:30,769
<i>As Icarus and Sir Isaac
Newton both discovered...</i>

143
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:34,097
<i>...what goes up
must come down.</i>

144
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:46,096
<i>In the world famous
training camp</i>

145
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:47,653
<i>at Garmisch in Germany...</i>

146
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:50,652
<i>...you will find
the world's elite ski-jumpers.</i>

147
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:53,692
<i>...such as the Flying Finn,
Matti Nykanen,</i>

148
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:56,089
<i>showing how it's really done.</i>

149
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:14,657
I hate
to disappoint you but, um...

150
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:17,812
...we haven't got an
Olympic ski-jumping squad.

151
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:19,738
Not even a small one?

152
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:21,817
No. Last...

153
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:25,419
No, Britain hasn't had
a ski-jumper since...

154
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:28,772
...1929.

155
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,570
Here we go.
Hector Mooney.

156
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:37,130
Yes, with a distance of
22.9 meters.

157
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:40,818
And there's no plans for a
team in the near future?

158
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:43,977
Well, not unless Mr. Mooney
comes out of retirement.

159
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:47,128
But he died
in 1975 so, no.

160
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:50,333
That is a shame.

161
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:01,451
Mum, where's my
purple rucksack?

162
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:03,292
Under the stairs.
Thank you.

163
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:06,291
Why? Are you
going camping?

164
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:09,175
No. Going to Germany.

165
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:11,891
Coach leaving very soon.

166
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:15,340
Oi.

167
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:20,296
What about your
City & Guilds, son?

168
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:25,208
Sorry, Dad,
I've gotta get on them slopes.

169
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:27,690
Oh, no.
Not this again, no.

170
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:30,979
Excuse me.

171
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:34,968
Hang on. What am I gonna tell
your plastering teacher?

172
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:36,220
Tell him I've
made new plans.

173
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:38,649
New plans?
What plans?

174
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:42,054
I'm gonna be
an Olympic ski-jumper.

175
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:46,491
No. No.

176
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:52,016
This is some kind
of joke, right?

177
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:54,455
Dad, it's not like
I'm taking up ballet.

178
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:56,172
It's still skiing.

179
00:13:56,380 --> 00:13:58,052
It's just a bit higher.

180
00:13:58,180 --> 00:14:00,694
You name me one,
one British ski-jumper.

181
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:01,935
Me.

182
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:03,898
Eddie Edwards.

183
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:05,692
I'm gonna be the squad.

184
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:10,609
And who's gonna pay
for all this? Eh?

185
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:12,577
I'm not having your mother
put through all that again.

186
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:14,292
We had bailiffs
knocking on the door,

187
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:16,575
all hours of the day,
taking away the sofa.

188
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:18,179
And it's because of you,
by the way,

189
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:20,376
that I'm driving
my campervan to work.

190
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:21,813
They're dirty.
Yeah, I know.

191
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:23,453
We haven't had a holiday
in three years, son,

192
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:25,531
and your mother,
she loves Blackpool.

193
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:27,178
I don't like
Blackpool, Terry.

194
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:28,375
Dad.

195
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:30,735
It's gonna be okay,
I promise.

196
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:33,897
I'm gonna work it out.

197
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:37,773
He's gonna break his neck.

198
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:39,811
Oh, I'm gonna
break his neck.

199
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:52,051
Do you really wanna put
yourself through this again?

200
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:54,813
It's a world that
doesn't wanna know you.

201
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:57,098
So what's new?

202
00:14:58,420 --> 00:15:01,412
Are you trying to tell me you never
had a dream when you were a kid, Dad?

203
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:04,936
Course I did.
I'm not made of stone, son.

204
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:07,936
You never said.
What was it?

205
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:10,411
It was to be a plasterer.

206
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:13,740
Bye, Dad.

207
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:15,293
Yeah, bye, son.

208
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:32,811
You're the Flying Finn.

209
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:35,250
You're Matti.
I know.

210
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:41,457
You want an autograph?

211
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:43,258
Yes, please. Um...

212
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:49,531
Bus ticket.

213
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:51,380
No.

214
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:56,938
Bye, Matti.

215
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:38,777
What are you doing here?

216
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:41,333
I'm so sorry,

217
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:42,853
I didn't have
anywhere to sleep.

218
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:44,737
An Englishman
sleeping in my cupboard.

219
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:48,209
Happens a lot.
You know why?

220
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:50,530
It's the good
German beer...

221
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:52,616
...and not this
pee-pee water

222
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:54,691
you're drinking back home.
Am I right?

223
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:57,568
Well, no, actually.
I don't drink.

224
00:18:57,700 --> 00:18:59,611
So what are
you doing here?

225
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:01,656
Well, I'm a ski-jumper.

226
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:03,412
Well, I want
to be a ski-jumper.

227
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:05,456
I mean, I'm not a ski-jumper
yet but my mum says

228
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:07,260
I'm a very resourceful,
determined person...

229
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:09,092
...and I think that with
some time and guidance

230
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:12,172
I probably will make it
as a ski-jumper.

231
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:13,852
You're a ski-jumper?

232
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:15,129
Yeah.

233
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:17,575
Well, you are not
the first ski-jumper

234
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:19,776
to wake up in my cupboard.

235
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:21,771
But, back in the past,

236
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:24,499
I would have been
in here with you.

237
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:26,289
Okay.

238
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:28,613
You have somewhere
to sleep tonight?

239
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:30,220
Mmm-mmm.

240
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:32,500
Okay.

241
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:36,175
You help me in the bar
and I'll let you stay here.

242
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:38,537
Really?
That would be amazing.

243
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:40,451
And maybe sometimes

244
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:42,974
I come and visit you.
Would you like that?

245
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:47,459
Would you like me
to visit you?

246
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:48,973
I probably won't be in here that much,
to be honest.

247
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:53,491
What with all the training
I mentioned and, um... Uh...

248
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:55,059
Do you have
the key for the...?

249
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:56,459
I'll get it
off you later.

250
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:58,332
- Okay. Good luck.
- Yeah.

251
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:32,889
Yes!

252
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:35,452
What a doddle.

253
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:40,213
Right. I think I'm ready
for that bigger one.

254
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:24,860
Okay.

255
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:34,218
I've seen worse injuries but,
you know, normally

256
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:36,575
they come from
the bigger jumps.

257
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:40,778
Who's your coach?

258
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:41,975
I've been giving it
a lot of thought

259
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:44,016
and I'm not sure
I need one.

260
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:46,096
Bjorn. Hey, Bjorn.
Good to see you.

261
00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:49,938
Norwegian.
He was a good jumper in his time.

262
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:53,532
Now he's a coach.

263
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:54,979
He's a coach?

264
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:56,328
Mmm-hmm. I think so.

265
00:21:57,700 --> 00:21:59,292
With the beard?

266
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:02,095
Yes, the one... Yeah.
And the blond hair?

267
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:05,533
Thank you, Petra.

268
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:08,415
Hello?

269
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:10,378
Hiya, fellas,
I'm Eddie Edwards.

270
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:13,372
I'm Great Britain.
Oh God. Nude. Um...

271
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:18,655
So, basically I...

272
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:21,580
...I've just started
on the 40 meters

273
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:23,571
and I'm making
solid progress.

274
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:24,849
But I just wondered
if I could get

275
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:27,135
a few bits of advice
and some tips.

276
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:29,256
How do you land, exactly?

277
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:33,012
You been jumping long?

278
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:34,812
Since yesterday afternoon.

279
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:41,452
I know, I'm already on the 40.
I'm a fast learner.

280
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:50,618
How old are you?

281
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:52,892
I'm 22.
Hmm...

282
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:55,775
In Norway, the time
to be starting jumping

283
00:22:55,860 --> 00:22:58,533
is when you are
six years old.

284
00:22:58,660 --> 00:23:00,651
Six years old.
Yeah.

285
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:02,653
Or younger.

286
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:07,373
No. You're a bit too late,
Mr. Britain man.

287
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:09,815
Mmm...

288
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:13,498
Yes, okay.

289
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:15,969
Well, there's a lot to be
thinking about there so...

290
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:18,608
...I'm gonna
just get to it.

291
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:20,534
Okay.

292
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:23,015
Stupid Englishman.

293
00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:26,740
I bet he's dead by the weekend.

294
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:09,652
No messing about this time.

295
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:11,014
Let's do it.

296
00:24:37,180 --> 00:24:38,852
Whoa!

297
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:12,369
Ah!

298
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:27,972
So, you're
the mystery elf

299
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:30,130
who's been hacking up
my slope, huh?

300
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:32,017
Just you? No pickaxe?

301
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:34,058
You do realize
the time to start jumping

302
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:35,209
is when you're
five or six?

303
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:36,340
Thanks.

304
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:39,056
The Norwegians
already told me that.

305
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:41,779
Did they also tell you you
look ridiculous in that gear?

306
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:44,377
At least I'm wearing a jacket.

307
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:45,728
This is my jacket, pal.

308
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:46,889
Maybe you should
wear one, too.

309
00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:48,578
No. Drinking doesn't
agree with me.

310
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:50,173
Neither does ski-jumping.

311
00:25:50,260 --> 00:25:52,535
Yeah, well, when I want advice
on how to drunkenly plow snow,

312
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:54,053
I'll look you up.

313
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:57,570
Don't even think about
doing the 70 meter.

314
00:25:57,660 --> 00:26:00,340
I don't want to have to clean up
your mess when you break your neck.

315
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:01,769
Whatever.

316
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:03,498
What would you know
about it, anyway?

317
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:08,058
Get off my slope.

318
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:20,215
Bronson Peary.

319
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:23,133
Interstate youth
champion 1968.

320
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:26,616
Then the Olympic Squad
under Warren Sharp.

321
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:28,813
The Warren Sharp?

322
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:30,970
Yeah.
The great American coach.

323
00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:33,255
Peary was his star jumper.
He broke records.

324
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:35,218
He was really
a gifted flyer

325
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:38,332
with a very
special style. But...

326
00:26:39,060 --> 00:26:41,290
...he was too crazy,
you know?

327
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:43,615
And now he's just crazy,
but in a different way.

328
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:45,731
Bronson Peary. How come
I've never heard of him?

329
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:47,498
They kicked him out.

330
00:26:47,620 --> 00:26:49,212
What for?

331
00:26:49,340 --> 00:26:52,810
Arrogance. Bad discipline.
Drunkenness. Fornication.

332
00:26:53,060 --> 00:26:56,177
What you probably call
"being a total loser."

333
00:26:57,140 --> 00:26:58,812
Definitely him.

334
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:02,176
Petra, do you mind
if I borrow this?

335
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:04,809
Yeah, take it.
Okay, thanks.

336
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:10,693
I thought we could
have a little chat about

337
00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:13,055
me being an
Olympic ski-jumper.

338
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:15,260
You've more chance of being
a ballerina than a jumper.

339
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:17,459
Good one.

340
00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:19,371
I was just after
a few tips, really.

341
00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:20,973
Give up,
there's one for free.

342
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:24,292
Petra told me
you used to jump for America.

343
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:27,088
Yeah, Petra has
a lot of stories, man.

344
00:27:27,620 --> 00:27:28,689
She gave me
this book, actually,

345
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:30,930
by your old coach
Warren Sharp.

346
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:35,654
Where's my jacket?

347
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:45,859
For as long as
I can remember,

348
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:48,090
it has been my ambition
to become an Olympian.

349
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:49,980
What?

350
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:51,533
Olympics.

351
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:54,009
Britain doesn't have a ski-jumping
team so I was thinking...

352
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:57,012
Okay. Now I know
you're crazy.

353
00:27:57,940 --> 00:28:00,613
Look, I know we didn't get
off to the best of starts...

354
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:02,258
...but you shouldn't be
fixing rust-buckets.

355
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:03,409
You should be coaching.

356
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:05,491
It's a classic
1972 Trans-Am, man.

357
00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:08,134
I'm just saying,
if I had your pedigree and experience...

358
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:10,256
Yeah, well you don't.
I'm busy.

359
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:12,416
Okay, I've plateaued.

360
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:13,694
Without your help,

361
00:28:13,780 --> 00:28:15,213
I don't think
I'm gonna get any better.

362
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:17,655
Really? Okay. Well, then
you won't get any better.

363
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:18,855
Right.

364
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:20,931
I'll come back later.
Don't.

365
00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:22,693
What a lunatic.

366
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:33,854
Wanna see how
it's really done?

367
00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:36,613
Watch this guy.
Number 2 in the world.

368
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:08,332
And he knew what he was doing.
You don't stand a chance.

369
00:29:43,060 --> 00:29:44,812
- Hi, Bronson.
- Oi.

370
00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:47,489
You truly are
a great Olympian.

371
00:29:54,740 --> 00:29:57,095
Always drink milk
when I'm in training.

372
00:29:57,180 --> 00:29:58,977
Calcium. Helps to keep
the bones strong.

373
00:29:59,060 --> 00:30:00,937
Right, yeah.
What do you think, Petra?

374
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:02,419
Good-looking
boy like this,

375
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:04,650
he shouldn't be crashing
into mountains.

376
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:06,776
He should be
crashing into ladies.

377
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:08,134
Hey, hey, be nice.

378
00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:10,541
Never really been my specialty
if I'm completely honest...

379
00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:12,889
Really? Never would
have guessed, man.

380
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:15,490
Hey, you still
looking for pointers?

381
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:18,333
It's that way
back to England.

382
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:19,648
Hey, shut it.

383
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:21,420
Hey, why don't you
order another one?

384
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:27,091
They have no idea,
do they?

385
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:31,295
You're the guy
who struck the first

386
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:32,574
90 meters
at Copper Peak,

387
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:34,975
with no headwind,
in 1970 Opening Trials,

388
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:37,813
and they think you're
just some old drunk.

389
00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:39,929
Thanks, I think.

390
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:42,694
You can learn a lot
from that Warren Sharp's book.

391
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:44,460
You've been doing
your homework, have you?

392
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:45,728
I'll cut straight
to the point.

393
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:48,493
I'm gonna be up bright and breezy
tomorrow morning for some extra training.

394
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:49,649
No.

395
00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:52,658
So the old drunk is teaching
the English how to jump.

396
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:54,931
That's fantastic.
Is that milk?

397
00:30:55,660 --> 00:30:57,298
I don't drink alcohol so...

398
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:02,212
I love it. It's good.
It's too good.

399
00:31:02,780 --> 00:31:05,169
Too good! Yeah.

400
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:07,177
There's a new team in town!

401
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:08,528
Hold this for me,
will you?

402
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:11,453
Milky Boy and
the PistenBully driver!

403
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:13,858
Hey, don't hurt yourself.

404
00:31:14,020 --> 00:31:15,533
Hey, hey, hey.

405
00:31:16,420 --> 00:31:18,411
My jumpers do not fight.

406
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:21,013
But I do.

407
00:31:22,660 --> 00:31:23,729
Shit.

408
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:29,733
Did I win?

409
00:31:30,540 --> 00:31:33,213
Not exactly.
But I got your watch.

410
00:31:37,660 --> 00:31:39,890
Come here, I'm gonna
show you something.

411
00:31:41,380 --> 00:31:44,770
Okay, this is the
Norwegian training camp.

412
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:48,652
You wanted to get some tips.

413
00:31:50,060 --> 00:31:52,255
Well, here is
how not to do it.

414
00:31:53,780 --> 00:31:55,771
Look at all this crap here.

415
00:31:57,180 --> 00:31:58,898
I mean, what is all this?

416
00:31:58,980 --> 00:32:01,448
They wanna turn
everyone into robots.

417
00:32:01,580 --> 00:32:04,333
They don't understand
the jumping paradox, man.

418
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:07,412
This is not just a sport,
it's an art.

419
00:32:08,180 --> 00:32:10,091
It's spiritual, man.

420
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:13,735
You gotta
free your mind first.

421
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:17,011
You gotta just,
kinda fly, man.

422
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:18,971
You wanna just fly.

423
00:32:23,780 --> 00:32:25,498
What is the jumping paradox?

424
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:26,655
The what?

425
00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:29,538
The jumping paradox.
That thing you said a second ago.

426
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:33,170
Okay. I'm gonna
say this once.

427
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:36,817
The foundation
of any jump is what?

428
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:37,900
Take-off.

429
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:39,129
Very good.

430
00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:40,968
Very good.

431
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:44,976
The paradox

432
00:32:45,060 --> 00:32:47,574
is simultaneously
stretching up...

433
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:49,850
...and leaning
into your descent.

434
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:51,658
It's unnatural

435
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:54,095
because you actually
take-off downwards. Okay?

436
00:32:54,780 --> 00:32:57,260
Your body has gotta lean forward
in order to give you the lift.

437
00:32:57,340 --> 00:32:59,410
- Like the wing of a bird.
- Just...

438
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:04,093
Come on, man,
be the wing of a bird.

439
00:33:05,540 --> 00:33:09,135
That's it. So, your skis go up,
your legs go back.

440
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:10,858
Your body goes forward
and you go down

441
00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:13,977
all while falling through
the air at 70 mph, man.

442
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:16,011
Up, back, forward.

443
00:33:17,060 --> 00:33:18,500
What are you doing?
I'm just helping.

444
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:22,977
Up, back, forward, down.
Up, back, forward, down.

445
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:25,568
Say it.
Up, back, forward, down.

446
00:33:25,660 --> 00:33:26,888
Exactly.

447
00:33:28,220 --> 00:33:29,255
Oh.

448
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:31,615
Fell in love
with this sport, man.

449
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:33,179
It started with
this little baby.

450
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:35,490
This little
15 meter little vixen.

451
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:36,854
You manage
to land that because

452
00:33:36,940 --> 00:33:38,658
it's meant to hook you
into the sport, right...

453
00:33:38,740 --> 00:33:40,810
...otherwise you wouldn't
even bother trying.

454
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:42,049
The 40 meter,

455
00:33:42,180 --> 00:33:44,375
when you stack
you get bruised,

456
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:46,212
which I don't need
to explain to you.

457
00:33:48,180 --> 00:33:49,499
Sorry.

458
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:52,492
The 70 meter...

459
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:54,015
...you break bones

460
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:56,216
and you're lucky
if you can walk again.

461
00:33:56,340 --> 00:33:59,252
The 90 meter.
The goddess.

462
00:34:03,060 --> 00:34:04,413
Let's just say
in the Wild West

463
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:05,940
we'd be measuring
you for your coffin

464
00:34:06,020 --> 00:34:08,329
before you even
reach the stairs.

465
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:12,891
Never forget that, kid.

466
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:22,450
You know what?
Enough talk. It's showtime.

467
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:24,859
Showtime?

468
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:38,854
Sorry, mate, I just
need to borrow them.

469
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:39,940
Oi.

470
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:45,213
Oh, my God.

471
00:34:45,340 --> 00:34:48,332
Come on!
Spread your wings and die!

472
00:35:57,020 --> 00:35:58,169
Good jump.

473
00:35:58,300 --> 00:35:59,653
Yeah!

474
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:01,259
Let's party!

475
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:29,814
Up, back, forward, down.

476
00:36:30,740 --> 00:36:33,413
Up, back, forward, down.

477
00:36:52,140 --> 00:36:54,813
Yes! Yes, yes, yes!

478
00:37:05,620 --> 00:37:06,939
Amazing.

479
00:37:07,660 --> 00:37:10,379
I think I'm ready
for the 70 meters.

480
00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:21,212
How long you been
sitting there?

481
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:25,132
Less than an hour.
I landed the 40 meters.

482
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:26,932
I don't care.

483
00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:31,259
And I've decided...

484
00:37:31,340 --> 00:37:33,251
I'm going to the
Olympics in Calgary.

485
00:37:33,340 --> 00:37:35,137
Why don't you
watch it on TV?

486
00:37:35,260 --> 00:37:37,774
I'm not going to watch,
I'm going to jump.

487
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:39,219
You're what?

488
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:40,534
I've got
a golden opportunity.

489
00:37:40,620 --> 00:37:43,214
The only thing I need to do
to qualify is compete.

490
00:37:43,420 --> 00:37:45,297
Must be some
minimum requirement.

491
00:37:45,380 --> 00:37:48,053
Distance,
number of jumps, talent?

492
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:50,300
No.

493
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:52,891
See, that's the beauty of it.

494
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:56,097
They've not updated
the rules for 52 years.

495
00:37:56,700 --> 00:37:58,418
What's your name, man?

496
00:37:58,540 --> 00:37:59,575
Eddie.

497
00:37:59,740 --> 00:38:00,775
Eddie, okay.

498
00:38:00,940 --> 00:38:03,613
Eddie, the smallest Olympic
jump is 70 meters. Okay?

499
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:05,577
You'll die if you try it.

500
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:07,372
Given the average jumper
takes four years

501
00:38:07,460 --> 00:38:08,893
to build up to it.

502
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:10,499
Well, I'm not
the average jumper.

503
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:12,650
Correct. You're well
below average.

504
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:14,611
I just did
the 40 meters in a day.

505
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:16,816
I'm ready for the 70 meters.
I'll do it now if you want.

506
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:19,130
I'm ready
for my breakfast, so...

507
00:38:20,140 --> 00:38:21,140
Don't.

508
00:38:22,540 --> 00:38:24,496
I need your permission
if I'm gonna jump.

509
00:38:24,580 --> 00:38:25,615
Just get the
hell out of here.

510
00:38:25,740 --> 00:38:26,980
Not until
I get your permission.

511
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:28,891
Fine, you got my permission.
Give me my breakfast.

512
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:30,299
I'd like it in writing.

513
00:38:30,380 --> 00:38:32,211
I'll tattoo it
on your face if you like.

514
00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:35,489
No, that won't
be necessary. Thanks.

515
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:37,169
Come on, let's go.

516
00:38:50,740 --> 00:38:52,378
Any tips, then?

517
00:38:52,820 --> 00:38:54,299
Don't die.

518
00:38:57,300 --> 00:38:58,733
All right.

519
00:39:01,660 --> 00:39:03,139
You're not coming up?

520
00:39:03,220 --> 00:39:05,575
Crashes look
just as good from here.

521
00:39:11,020 --> 00:39:12,578
I'm doing it.

522
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:14,213
Sure you are.

523
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:16,974
Hi.
Yeah?

524
00:39:17,140 --> 00:39:19,256
He's not actually
going to jump, is he?

525
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:23,134
He's crazy but he's not
suicidal. He's just...

526
00:39:23,540 --> 00:39:26,054
<i>...kylling,</i>
you know. <i>Kylling.</i>

527
00:39:26,540 --> 00:39:28,815
What?
Game of chicken. <i>Kylling.</i>

528
00:40:23,940 --> 00:40:24,940
Everything okay?

529
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:26,851
Yeah, fine.
Just getting ready.

530
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:30,138
Never done it before.

531
00:40:31,940 --> 00:40:33,009
Honestly?

532
00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:35,338
Could you give me
a push, please?

533
00:40:35,420 --> 00:40:36,648
A push?

534
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:37,900
Mmm.

535
00:40:38,140 --> 00:40:40,210
It's a lot higher
than I expected it to...

536
00:40:40,300 --> 00:40:41,300
Whoa!

537
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:53,015
Don't bend your legs!

538
00:41:06,020 --> 00:41:08,011
Stay there. Stay there.
Can you move?

539
00:41:09,140 --> 00:41:11,654
What's wrong with you, man?
You could've killed yourself.

540
00:41:11,780 --> 00:41:13,372
Just stay there.

541
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:16,335
Hey, hey, hey.
Just take it easy,

542
00:41:16,420 --> 00:41:17,489
everything's
under control here.

543
00:41:17,580 --> 00:41:18,729
If this happens again,

544
00:41:18,820 --> 00:41:20,617
you will need
a stretcher, too.

545
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:22,452
I'll look forward
to it, man. Yeah.

546
00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:24,699
Take away.

547
00:41:33,100 --> 00:41:34,453
Oh, man.

548
00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:39,378
Crazy Brit.

549
00:42:32,060 --> 00:42:34,369
<i>Peary was
the most naturally gifted</i>

550
00:42:34,460 --> 00:42:36,496
<i>ski-jumper I ever trained.</i>

551
00:42:36,820 --> 00:42:39,698
<i>And he's also my
biggest disappointment.</i>

552
00:42:39,820 --> 00:42:42,493
<i>He should have been
my greatest champion...</i>

553
00:42:42,620 --> 00:42:45,976
<i>...but his focus was not
always on the mountain.</i>

554
00:42:46,140 --> 00:42:48,893
<i>He never understood
that a true Olympian</i>

555
00:42:49,020 --> 00:42:51,250
<i>was not just about
a God-given skill set.</i>

556
00:42:51,420 --> 00:42:54,571
<i>It's about never giving up,
no matter what.</i>

557
00:43:01,460 --> 00:43:04,770
<i>Knowing that doing your best
is the only option...</i>

558
00:43:05,220 --> 00:43:07,893
<i>...even if it results
in failure.</i>

559
00:43:28,180 --> 00:43:31,490
<i>Bronson Peary was
my biggest disappointment.</i>

560
00:43:49,620 --> 00:43:51,611
Not gonna kill me, are you?

561
00:43:51,740 --> 00:43:53,620
If I wanted to kill you,
Eddie, I'd just let you

562
00:43:53,700 --> 00:43:55,816
continue this suicidal
journey on your own...

563
00:43:55,900 --> 00:43:56,935
...because something tells me

564
00:43:57,020 --> 00:43:58,533
you're not gonna give up,
are you?

565
00:43:59,340 --> 00:44:01,820
I plan to try and jump the 70
meters again as soon as possible.

566
00:44:01,900 --> 00:44:04,619
No. Your plan is as follows.

567
00:44:04,740 --> 00:44:07,459
I am gonna teach you
how to land the 70 meter.

568
00:44:07,580 --> 00:44:10,413
'Cause let's face it, man, you've
done the hardest part which is...

569
00:44:10,540 --> 00:44:13,054
...actually having
the guts to do it. Right?

570
00:44:13,180 --> 00:44:15,011
Most people take one look
at it, walk away forever.

571
00:44:15,100 --> 00:44:17,295
Not Eddie Edwards, so...

572
00:44:17,420 --> 00:44:20,890
Garmisch Seniors Tournament.
Next month.

573
00:44:21,020 --> 00:44:22,817
Final jump of the day
is an open event

574
00:44:22,900 --> 00:44:26,290
so if you could just
land one jump, you are...

575
00:44:26,420 --> 00:44:28,331
Going to the Olympics.

576
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:30,377
Exactly. Get better soon.

577
00:44:31,060 --> 00:44:32,379
All right, coach.

578
00:44:32,460 --> 00:44:34,098
I'm not your coach. Okay?

579
00:44:34,180 --> 00:44:36,614
Seriously. A coach teaches
you how to jump properly.

580
00:44:36,700 --> 00:44:38,179
I'm just teaching you
how to land

581
00:44:38,260 --> 00:44:39,579
so I can get you
out of my hair

582
00:44:39,660 --> 00:44:42,015
as soon as possible.
Got it?

583
00:44:42,380 --> 00:44:44,018
Peary.
What?

584
00:44:45,100 --> 00:44:46,328
Thanks.

585
00:44:49,540 --> 00:44:51,451
Fine. Get better.

586
00:45:12,020 --> 00:45:13,089
If you're really
gonna do this,

587
00:45:13,180 --> 00:45:14,898
we should run through
a couple of things.

588
00:45:14,980 --> 00:45:16,254
Are your knees better?
Mmm-hmm.

589
00:45:16,340 --> 00:45:17,568
They better be.

590
00:45:17,980 --> 00:45:19,777
Okay, you ready?
Yeah.

591
00:45:21,460 --> 00:45:22,859
Okay, before we start,

592
00:45:22,940 --> 00:45:24,976
who's your favorite
female movie star?

593
00:45:25,260 --> 00:45:26,852
Honestly?
Yeah.

594
00:45:26,980 --> 00:45:29,289
Bo Derek.
Bo Derek? Okay, good call.

595
00:45:29,420 --> 00:45:32,173
Okay, every jump
from here on in...

596
00:45:32,260 --> 00:45:35,218
...I want you to approach it
as though you are making love

597
00:45:35,300 --> 00:45:37,530
to the beautiful Bo Derek.

598
00:45:37,660 --> 00:45:38,934
Okay?
Right.

599
00:45:39,060 --> 00:45:40,379
Starting gate
is your foreplay.

600
00:45:40,460 --> 00:45:43,896
The in-run is where you
build your rhythm. Okay?

601
00:45:44,060 --> 00:45:45,379
And the take-off,

602
00:45:45,460 --> 00:45:47,974
that's your special moment.
All right?

603
00:45:48,100 --> 00:45:49,374
Same facial expressions.

604
00:45:49,460 --> 00:45:51,337
Same straining
of the muscles.

605
00:45:51,420 --> 00:45:54,696
The same peaceful
feeling of release, okay?

606
00:45:54,820 --> 00:45:56,014
If you do it right.

607
00:45:56,140 --> 00:45:57,620
Of course, with any
act of love-making

608
00:45:57,660 --> 00:46:00,254
there's only one way to be
sure you've done it right.

609
00:46:00,340 --> 00:46:01,409
Right?

610
00:46:01,540 --> 00:46:02,540
Yeah.

611
00:46:04,260 --> 00:46:05,932
You fall asleep?

612
00:46:06,300 --> 00:46:07,938
She falls asleep?

613
00:46:08,380 --> 00:46:10,018
Okay. Watch.

614
00:46:11,820 --> 00:46:13,378
Mmm. Oh...

615
00:46:13,860 --> 00:46:15,259
Oh, Bo. Oh, all right.

616
00:46:15,340 --> 00:46:16,739
Oh! Bo!

617
00:46:18,100 --> 00:46:19,852
Oh!

618
00:46:22,700 --> 00:46:24,895
Oh! Uh! Mmm!

619
00:46:27,220 --> 00:46:30,053
Bo Derek!

620
00:46:31,380 --> 00:46:33,052
Oh, yeah!

621
00:46:35,580 --> 00:46:36,774
Right.

622
00:46:36,860 --> 00:46:38,691
Am I going down there?
Yeah.

623
00:46:38,780 --> 00:46:40,896
Brilliant.
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Eddie.

624
00:46:41,300 --> 00:46:45,452
Crouch. Clench. Release.

625
00:46:45,860 --> 00:46:47,179
That's it.

626
00:46:47,420 --> 00:46:48,739
Yes!

627
00:46:49,460 --> 00:46:50,893
The most shattering physical

628
00:46:50,980 --> 00:46:52,299
and emotional experience
of your life

629
00:46:52,420 --> 00:46:53,739
and that's
the noise you make?

630
00:46:53,820 --> 00:46:55,014
It is in England, yeah.

631
00:46:58,060 --> 00:46:59,618
Okay. Do it again.

632
00:47:04,060 --> 00:47:05,175
That's what I'm talking about.

633
00:47:05,260 --> 00:47:06,295
That was better, weren't it?
Whoo!

634
00:47:06,420 --> 00:47:08,172
Bo Derek! Yeah, baby!

635
00:47:09,260 --> 00:47:11,251
I think a little bit
of wee came out.

636
00:47:13,900 --> 00:47:17,654
So, all you have to do is make
this landing and you qualify.

637
00:47:17,740 --> 00:47:19,253
One jump away
from the Olympics, man.

638
00:47:19,340 --> 00:47:21,137
Get your skis.

639
00:47:21,820 --> 00:47:23,299
Okay. Stay focused.

640
00:47:23,420 --> 00:47:26,492
Do everything I told
you to do only better.

641
00:47:26,940 --> 00:47:28,931
A lot better. Go.

642
00:47:39,900 --> 00:47:42,619
He says you must
treat every jump

643
00:47:42,700 --> 00:47:44,736
as if it is your last.

644
00:47:44,900 --> 00:47:47,778
We are saying for us,
that is easy.

645
00:47:47,900 --> 00:47:49,379
Oh...

646
00:47:49,460 --> 00:47:51,815
I know the feeling.

647
00:47:51,900 --> 00:47:55,210
Idiot. The Englishman will die.

648
00:47:56,380 --> 00:47:57,654
<i>Edwards...</i>

649
00:47:57,940 --> 00:47:59,339
Good luck.

650
00:47:59,700 --> 00:48:02,339
<i>Edwards. Great Britain.</i>

651
00:48:14,260 --> 00:48:16,569
Come on, Eddie.
Come on, man.

652
00:48:22,260 --> 00:48:23,659
Bo Derek.

653
00:48:38,980 --> 00:48:41,733
Arms back, chest down,
fanny in. Lift, lift!

654
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:05,898
<i>Edwards, 34 meters.</i>

655
00:49:06,060 --> 00:49:07,778
You're in the Olympics.

656
00:49:25,620 --> 00:49:26,973
Really?

657
00:49:27,780 --> 00:49:30,169
"Plucky plasterer
'Fast' Eddie Edwards..."

658
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:31,415
Fast, huh?

659
00:49:31,540 --> 00:49:33,735
"...set a new British record

"Plucky plasterer."

663
00:49:40,540 --> 00:49:42,531
My dad would like that.

664
00:49:43,220 --> 00:49:45,097
Peary, this has got
the Olympic rings on.

665
00:49:45,620 --> 00:49:47,178
Well, it won't
open itself, man.

666
00:50:02,180 --> 00:50:03,740
"We request the pleasure
of your company

My work is done, man.
You're on your way.

"Fast" Eddie Edwards.

670
00:50:21,500 --> 00:50:23,138
Mr. Edwards.
Mr. Target.

671
00:50:23,220 --> 00:50:26,178
I just wanted to say to you
and to all of you...

672
00:50:26,300 --> 00:50:28,814
...what an honor
this is and...

673
00:50:29,140 --> 00:50:32,689
...I promise not to let you
or the Olympic Team down.

674
00:50:33,220 --> 00:50:35,893
Yes, that's
very nice, Eddie, but...

675
00:50:36,860 --> 00:50:38,816
...in the interest
of safety

676
00:50:38,900 --> 00:50:41,289
we've ratified
a minimum distance of...

677
00:50:41,380 --> 00:50:43,052
...61 meters.

678
00:50:43,460 --> 00:50:44,529
Great.

I'm afraid your jump
doesn't count, son.

685
00:50:58,260 --> 00:50:59,329
Wait, hang on.

686
00:50:59,540 --> 00:51:00,814
I've already qualified.

687
00:51:00,900 --> 00:51:02,253
Well, technically,
you haven't.

688
00:51:02,420 --> 00:51:04,172
Because you just
changed the rules.

689
00:51:04,260 --> 00:51:06,979
It costs £4.5 million

690
00:51:07,100 --> 00:51:09,250
to send a National Squad
to the Olympics.

691
00:51:10,220 --> 00:51:12,814
The Government gives us
a mere fraction of that.

692
00:51:13,420 --> 00:51:16,093
How do you think
we make up the difference?

693
00:51:16,220 --> 00:51:17,255
TV.

694
00:51:17,340 --> 00:51:18,340
Sponsorship.

695
00:51:18,780 --> 00:51:20,577
These companies pay

696
00:51:20,660 --> 00:51:22,776
to be associated
with certain qualities.

697
00:51:23,260 --> 00:51:26,570
Excellence. Achievements.
Victory.

698
00:51:26,700 --> 00:51:29,612
Strangely, they have no
desire to be associated

699
00:51:29,740 --> 00:51:31,890
with ludicrous
antics and defeat.

700
00:51:32,020 --> 00:51:34,170
So, why do I stop
being ludicrous

701
00:51:34,260 --> 00:51:36,251
if I jump 61 meters?

702
00:51:36,460 --> 00:51:37,529
That is the distance

703
00:51:37,620 --> 00:51:40,453
ratified by our
Safety Committee.

704
00:51:41,020 --> 00:51:43,693
Personally,
I'd prefer it to be higher.

705
00:51:45,220 --> 00:51:47,859
Or is it longer?
I never can tell.

706
00:51:48,100 --> 00:51:49,135
Either way,

707
00:51:49,260 --> 00:51:52,297
we will not have
amateurs in the Olympics.

708
00:51:52,900 --> 00:51:54,970
I thought the Olympics
was for amateurs.

709
00:51:58,980 --> 00:52:00,538
As the premier jumper

710
00:52:00,620 --> 00:52:02,133
and the British
record holder...

711
00:52:02,300 --> 00:52:06,054
...don't you think I have a
right to represent my country?

712
00:52:07,420 --> 00:52:08,420
No.

713
00:52:11,380 --> 00:52:13,052
You can see yourself out.

714
00:52:15,420 --> 00:52:16,614
What?

715
00:52:16,740 --> 00:52:18,332
Ugh. It's British
<i>Unausstehliches.</i>

716
00:52:18,420 --> 00:52:19,569
<i>I know.</i>

717
00:52:19,660 --> 00:52:20,888
The only way to qualify

718
00:52:20,980 --> 00:52:23,255
is to make 61 meters
in competition.

719
00:52:23,340 --> 00:52:25,058
So I'm gonna go
on the European circuit.

720
00:52:25,820 --> 00:52:27,970
Man, that's easier
said than done.

721
00:52:28,140 --> 00:52:30,495
Well, I'd need you to come, too.
Will you help me?

722
00:52:31,340 --> 00:52:33,729
Sure, Fly Boy. Why not?

723
00:52:33,820 --> 00:52:35,420
You get the money,
the transport, I'm in.

724
00:52:35,500 --> 00:52:36,649
Let's do this.

725
00:52:40,020 --> 00:52:42,011
So, if this is you now...

726
00:52:44,500 --> 00:52:46,491
...how much more
are they asking you to jump?

727
00:52:56,700 --> 00:52:58,179
Oh.

728
00:52:58,260 --> 00:53:00,171
That's you up poo creek.

729
00:53:00,620 --> 00:53:01,689
Terry.

730
00:53:02,140 --> 00:53:04,017
If I'm gonna go
on the European circuit

731
00:53:04,100 --> 00:53:06,091
I'm gonna need to raise
some serious cash.

732
00:53:06,220 --> 00:53:07,900
Yeah, well, don't ask us,
we ain't got any.

733
00:53:08,220 --> 00:53:09,220
I know.

734
00:53:09,300 --> 00:53:10,779
What about the money
for the van?

735
00:53:10,860 --> 00:53:12,691
Can't that wait
till next year?

736
00:53:12,860 --> 00:53:14,134
No.
I am not spending

737
00:53:14,220 --> 00:53:16,859
any more money
on this rubbish.

738
00:53:17,540 --> 00:53:18,893
It's a matter
of time before

739
00:53:18,980 --> 00:53:20,660
he walks through that
door in a wheelchair.

740
00:53:20,900 --> 00:53:22,970
So you've gotta stop taking
all these stupid risks, son,

741
00:53:23,060 --> 00:53:25,016
and come back and do
a little bit of plastering.

742
00:53:25,380 --> 00:53:27,450
You tried your best.
Fair play to you. Well done.

743
00:53:27,540 --> 00:53:29,371
But it wasn't
good enough, was it?

744
00:53:29,540 --> 00:53:31,849
So it's got to stop.
All this has gotta stop. End of.

745
00:53:31,980 --> 00:53:33,299
Okay.

746
00:53:39,220 --> 00:53:41,211
Come on, son, hurry up.
I don't wanna be late.

747
00:53:41,420 --> 00:53:42,569
What are you doing?

748
00:53:42,700 --> 00:53:43,974
He's coming
to work with me.

749
00:53:44,060 --> 00:53:45,891
Is he?
Yeah, he is.

750
00:53:46,060 --> 00:53:47,971
Oi, come on, son, up you get.

751
00:53:48,060 --> 00:53:49,254
Look...

752
00:53:52,100 --> 00:53:53,249
Oi.

753
00:53:53,340 --> 00:53:54,659
What the hell
are you playing at?

754
00:53:54,740 --> 00:53:56,492
I just need to borrow
it for a few weeks.

755
00:53:56,580 --> 00:53:58,935
Get out of that van. Now.

756
00:53:59,060 --> 00:54:00,334
I'll take really good
care of it, I promise.

757
00:54:00,420 --> 00:54:02,695
- Thank you. Love you.
- I'm warning you.

758
00:54:03,580 --> 00:54:07,414
Oi. Come back here!
You thieving little git!

759
00:54:08,100 --> 00:54:09,169
Did you
know about this?

760
00:54:09,260 --> 00:54:10,773
Mmm. Yeah.

761
00:54:10,900 --> 00:54:13,300
And you're not gonna like what I
did with our savings, either.

762
00:54:13,340 --> 00:54:14,340
Oi!

763
00:54:54,420 --> 00:54:55,420
Ah...

764
00:54:55,620 --> 00:54:57,815
The wanderer returns, huh?

765
00:54:57,940 --> 00:55:00,295
Mum gave me some money and
I sorted out the transport.

766
00:55:00,380 --> 00:55:02,974
Is that what you call it?
Come on, let's get a drink.

767
00:55:03,100 --> 00:55:04,453
Hang on.

768
00:55:04,900 --> 00:55:07,209
I don't wanna get
snow on the seat.

769
00:55:07,340 --> 00:55:09,171
This window is a bugger.

770
00:55:11,580 --> 00:55:14,811
I think it's a good thing they
turned you down, man. It is.

771
00:55:15,100 --> 00:55:17,489
I mean, 61 meters
is a genuine distance.

772
00:55:17,580 --> 00:55:19,855
Means you gotta
do this for real.

773
00:55:20,020 --> 00:55:22,454
Well, it's easy for you to say,
you were a champion.

774
00:55:22,580 --> 00:55:24,650
You were always
really good.

775
00:55:25,540 --> 00:55:27,451
I was kicked off
every team I was ever on

776
00:55:27,540 --> 00:55:29,220
before I even got
a chance to prove myself.

777
00:55:29,300 --> 00:55:32,098
Believe it or not, I do know what
it's like to be written off, Eddie.

778
00:55:32,820 --> 00:55:34,014
Of course,
my solution was

779
00:55:34,100 --> 00:55:36,739
just to crawl inside
the bottle here, but...

780
00:55:38,380 --> 00:55:41,053
I was in hospital for a
year when I was a kid.

781
00:55:42,060 --> 00:55:43,732
Dodgy knees.

782
00:55:46,900 --> 00:55:49,573
All the doctors said
I should give up sport.

783
00:55:50,460 --> 00:55:52,212
Take up reading.

784
00:55:54,500 --> 00:55:55,694
First book I got:

785
00:55:55,820 --> 00:55:58,288
<i>The Official Olympic
Photo Album 1972,</i>

786
00:55:58,380 --> 00:55:59,495
<i>Moments of Glory.</i>

787
00:55:59,580 --> 00:56:01,172
Yeah, I know it.

788
00:56:04,380 --> 00:56:06,689
Well, anyway,
that is the book

789
00:56:06,860 --> 00:56:09,658
that made me realize
I needed my own moment.

790
00:56:12,300 --> 00:56:15,656
That one thing I could do
to prove them all wrong.

791
00:56:19,100 --> 00:56:20,931
Do you think I'm mad?

792
00:56:21,180 --> 00:56:22,249
Yeah.

793
00:56:23,860 --> 00:56:26,897
You're completely
mad, man. But, hey...

794
00:56:27,020 --> 00:56:29,454
...you kinda gotta be mad
to do this sport, right?

795
00:56:29,740 --> 00:56:30,740
Yep.

796
00:56:32,420 --> 00:56:33,420
So...

797
00:56:35,540 --> 00:56:37,531
...if you want your moment,
Eddie Edwards,

798
00:56:37,620 --> 00:56:39,417
I can get you your moment.

799
00:56:39,660 --> 00:56:41,059
But it's gonna
hurt like hell.

800
00:56:42,300 --> 00:56:43,858
For both of us.

801
00:56:48,300 --> 00:56:50,018
We need to get you
some proper equipment.

802
00:56:53,340 --> 00:56:54,489
What are we doing here?

803
00:56:54,660 --> 00:56:55,854
Shopping.

804
00:57:01,860 --> 00:57:03,612
Perfect.
Size 11, right?

805
00:57:03,700 --> 00:57:04,815
Mm-hmm.

806
00:57:04,940 --> 00:57:06,532
Oh, wow.

807
00:57:09,620 --> 00:57:11,178
Peary, is this not theft?

808
00:57:11,260 --> 00:57:12,978
It's the Lost and Found, man.

809
00:57:13,060 --> 00:57:14,857
Come on. Some guy dropped
10 bucks on the street

810
00:57:14,940 --> 00:57:16,453
and you were to pick it up,
would that be theft?

811
00:57:16,580 --> 00:57:17,615
Yes.

812
00:57:17,740 --> 00:57:19,139
What if he didn't know
it was missing?

813
00:57:19,220 --> 00:57:21,290
Then I'd give it
to charity or something.

814
00:57:21,420 --> 00:57:25,015
Eddie, you are a charity.
Your needs are much greater.

815
00:57:25,220 --> 00:57:26,778
What about you?

816
00:57:27,340 --> 00:57:29,649
Me? I'm just
stealing these.

817
00:57:37,900 --> 00:57:39,970
Any better?
It's not better. It's crap.

818
00:57:50,620 --> 00:57:51,689
It's more difficult
than I expected.

819
00:57:51,780 --> 00:57:52,780
Good.

820
00:58:17,620 --> 00:58:18,689
Come on, Eddie.

821
00:58:27,300 --> 00:58:29,894
<i>Edwards. 43 meters.</i>

822
00:58:30,260 --> 00:58:31,852
You're a disgrace
to the sport.

823
00:58:31,940 --> 00:58:33,851
Really? Good.

824
00:58:35,140 --> 00:58:36,812
Personal best!

825
00:58:38,060 --> 00:58:40,335
And we're a disgrace!

826
00:58:40,460 --> 00:58:43,338
Keep working on your
Telemark landing. It's key.

827
00:58:53,100 --> 00:58:54,100
Whoa!

828
00:58:57,660 --> 00:58:59,616
You're on your own, man.

829
00:59:01,100 --> 00:59:02,852
Faster, Peary!

830
00:59:02,980 --> 00:59:05,289
More speed!

831
00:59:05,420 --> 00:59:08,093
It's as fast
as this rust-bucket goes.

832
00:59:19,500 --> 00:59:22,060
Edwards. 49 meters.

833
00:59:52,980 --> 00:59:55,653
It's a practice jump. You don't
need paperwork for a practice jump.

834
00:59:58,220 --> 01:00:00,097
At Oberstdorf we do
everything to the letter.

835
01:00:00,300 --> 01:00:01,449
To the letter.

836
01:00:01,540 --> 01:00:02,939
I could've done
two jumps by now.

837
01:00:03,020 --> 01:00:06,217
Relax. Focused, not tense, remember?
Come on.

838
01:00:06,700 --> 01:00:08,850
Focused, not tense.

839
01:00:36,860 --> 01:00:39,420
I did it. 61 meters.

840
01:00:39,540 --> 01:00:41,770
And that was without
a headwind or breakfast.

841
01:00:41,860 --> 01:00:43,339
Yeah? Well, you do that
tomorrow, you're in,

842
01:00:43,420 --> 01:00:44,819
they can't get rid of you.

843
01:00:45,260 --> 01:00:47,410
Really?
I'm gonna tell your dad.

844
01:00:47,500 --> 01:00:50,094
He's gonna love it.
Yeah, all right.

845
01:00:50,220 --> 01:00:51,858
All right, lovely.

846
01:00:52,700 --> 01:00:54,292
Oh, my God.

847
01:00:58,340 --> 01:01:01,571
He has just jumped
61 meters in practice.

848
01:01:01,660 --> 01:01:03,378
61 meters.

849
01:01:03,500 --> 01:01:06,731
And if he makes that tomorrow,
he qualifies for the Olympics!

850
01:01:29,340 --> 01:01:32,491
<i>Number 11,
Edwards. Great Britain.</i>

851
01:01:47,380 --> 01:01:48,608
Ready.

852
01:02:11,140 --> 01:02:12,255
Whoa!

853
01:02:17,340 --> 01:02:20,650
<i>Edwards, Great Britain.
No jump.</i>

854
01:02:22,340 --> 01:02:24,854
You don't understand.
This is my last chance.

855
01:02:24,940 --> 01:02:26,532
You've got to give me
another run.

856
01:02:26,660 --> 01:02:28,252
At Oberstdorf we do
everything to the letter.

857
01:02:28,340 --> 01:02:29,773
To the letter, I know.
You keep saying.

858
01:02:29,860 --> 01:02:32,169
But the thing is,
it doesn't help me.

859
01:02:32,300 --> 01:02:33,858
The British
Olympic Association

860
01:02:33,940 --> 01:02:36,693
are trying to stop me,
but I have to do this.

861
01:02:36,820 --> 01:02:39,892
This year it's 61 meters.
Next year it'll be 71 meters.

862
01:02:40,020 --> 01:02:41,658
Then it's too late.

863
01:02:41,780 --> 01:02:43,213
I am going up
that hill to jump

864
01:02:43,300 --> 01:02:45,495
and you are going
to record my distance.

865
01:02:46,300 --> 01:02:48,018
No more jumping.

866
01:02:51,060 --> 01:02:52,732
Hey, come on.

867
01:02:52,860 --> 01:02:54,851
Let's go, man.
Let's go.

868
01:03:22,220 --> 01:03:24,575
You gotta put
that crash behind you, Eddie.

869
01:03:24,660 --> 01:03:26,890
And remember that practice...

870
01:03:27,020 --> 01:03:28,380
...I just want you
to know, for me,

871
01:03:28,460 --> 01:03:31,020
that was the best jump
you've ever done, by a mile.

872
01:03:31,140 --> 01:03:34,257
Everything was working,
man, everything. It was...

873
01:03:34,900 --> 01:03:37,812
Your take-off,
your timing, your balance...

874
01:03:37,940 --> 01:03:40,773
...your trajectory
all working together.

875
01:03:40,860 --> 01:03:43,294
It was like second nature.
It was...

876
01:03:44,700 --> 01:03:46,418
It was beautiful.

877
01:03:48,380 --> 01:03:50,371
I was really
proud of you, man.

878
01:04:18,140 --> 01:04:19,255
<i>Mum...</i>

879
01:04:19,460 --> 01:04:21,132
...Dad was right.

880
01:04:21,620 --> 01:04:24,293
Wasted all this time
and money on nothing.

881
01:04:24,420 --> 01:04:26,729
<i>My dream's turned
into a nightmare.</i>

882
01:04:27,620 --> 01:04:30,578
I'm really sorry to have done
this to both of you and...

883
01:04:30,660 --> 01:04:32,730
I promise I'm gonna
make it up to you.

884
01:04:33,820 --> 01:04:35,014
<i>No more messing around.</i>

885
01:04:35,180 --> 01:04:36,374
Don't be silly.

886
01:04:36,500 --> 01:04:39,412
You've had knock-backs before
and it's never stopped you.

887
01:04:39,620 --> 01:04:41,212
Come on, Eddie.
Dust yourself off.

888
01:04:41,340 --> 01:04:42,534
Mum, you don't understand.

889
01:04:42,620 --> 01:04:45,088
I'm never going
to the Olympics.

890
01:04:45,940 --> 01:04:48,249
That was my one chance
and I blew it.

891
01:04:49,940 --> 01:04:51,578
So I'm gonna work
the week out for Petra

892
01:04:51,660 --> 01:04:52,888
and then I'm coming home.

893
01:04:53,020 --> 01:04:54,055
<i>Good.</i>

894
01:04:54,220 --> 01:04:56,290
Now, look. Get the van
back here sharpish,

895
01:04:56,420 --> 01:04:58,380
and I don't ever wanna hear
about ski-jumps again.

896
01:04:58,940 --> 01:05:00,009
<i>Goodnight.</i>

897
01:05:02,820 --> 01:05:04,811
Don't worry about him, love.

898
01:05:06,100 --> 01:05:07,738
It'll be fine.

899
01:05:08,740 --> 01:05:10,731
I love you.
<i>Love you, too, Mum.</i>

900
01:05:10,900 --> 01:05:11,900
Bye.

901
01:05:12,940 --> 01:05:13,940
Bye.

902
01:05:28,900 --> 01:05:30,891
Hey, Eddie,
this came for you.

903
01:05:36,460 --> 01:05:37,779
Thank you.

904
01:05:51,140 --> 01:05:52,698
Peary!
Eddie, man, come here.

905
01:05:52,820 --> 01:05:54,014
I've been doing
some thinking.

906
01:05:54,100 --> 01:05:56,773
They recorded the
flippin' practice jump.

907
01:05:56,860 --> 01:05:57,860
Huh?

908
01:05:59,100 --> 01:06:00,692
It's official. It counts.

909
01:06:00,820 --> 01:06:04,335
61 meters.
"Everything to the letter."

910
01:06:04,900 --> 01:06:06,015
You should go and pack,
my friend,

911
01:06:06,100 --> 01:06:09,137
because we
are going to Canada.

912
01:06:09,860 --> 01:06:11,612
If you go now, they're
never gonna let you back.

913
01:06:11,700 --> 01:06:13,372
You understand that?
So?

914
01:06:13,500 --> 01:06:15,616
So, all you can prove is
you don't mind coming last?

915
01:06:17,300 --> 01:06:19,734
Mmm...
I don't mind really.

916
01:06:21,340 --> 01:06:23,570
Okay, look, you and me,

917
01:06:23,660 --> 01:06:25,651
we should take another
four years. Okay?

918
01:06:25,740 --> 01:06:28,334
Let me coach you properly
and we can do this for real.

919
01:06:28,460 --> 01:06:30,132
You could even jump
the 90 meter

920
01:06:30,220 --> 01:06:32,256
and be taken
seriously, Eddie.

921
01:06:32,340 --> 01:06:34,615
What are you talking about?
We've just pulled off the impossible.

922
01:06:34,740 --> 01:06:36,093
I'm gonna go.

923
01:06:36,260 --> 01:06:37,852
Then you're on your own, man.
Because I can tell you,

924
01:06:37,940 --> 01:06:40,773
it won't mean anything
if you sell yourself short.

925
01:06:40,900 --> 01:06:42,220
What's
the matter with you?

926
01:06:42,260 --> 01:06:43,409
We should go back in '92,

927
01:06:43,500 --> 01:06:45,331
not as a qualifier,
as a contender.

928
01:06:45,420 --> 01:06:46,819
I don't understand.
This is everything

929
01:06:46,900 --> 01:06:48,015
we've worked for, isn't it?

930
01:06:48,140 --> 01:06:49,289
Listen to me...

931
01:06:49,460 --> 01:06:51,460
...a year after I got bumped
from the Olympic Squad

932
01:06:51,540 --> 01:06:53,770
I went back to Warren Sharp
to apologize. Okay?

933
01:06:53,860 --> 01:06:55,373
I literally got down
on my knees

934
01:06:55,460 --> 01:06:57,291
and I begged him
to let me jump again.

935
01:06:57,380 --> 01:06:59,416
You wanna know what
his last words to me were?

936
01:06:59,540 --> 01:07:01,258
"You will never take
jumping seriously

937
01:07:01,340 --> 01:07:04,537
"because you do not
take yourself seriously."

938
01:07:05,700 --> 01:07:08,294
Okay. Are they gonna be
your last words to me, too?

939
01:07:08,820 --> 01:07:10,492
Don't make the
same mistake, Eddie.

940
01:07:10,580 --> 01:07:12,730
Okay? I'm begging you.

941
01:07:12,900 --> 01:07:15,368
Do it right
or don't do it at all.

942
01:07:15,500 --> 01:07:17,013
You're crazy.
This time a year ago

943
01:07:17,100 --> 01:07:18,249
you were plowing snow.

944
01:07:18,380 --> 01:07:20,257
And you were landing
on your head a year ago.

945
01:07:20,340 --> 01:07:21,580
Look at the progress
we've made.

946
01:07:21,740 --> 01:07:23,458
Exactly!
This is my moment!

947
01:07:23,540 --> 01:07:25,815
Don't make this
your moment, please!

948
01:07:25,900 --> 01:07:28,175
You'll be a fool.
They'll make you a fool.

949
01:07:28,260 --> 01:07:29,534
Well, I'd rather be
a sober fool

950
01:07:29,620 --> 01:07:31,770
than a drunken coward!

951
01:07:56,100 --> 01:07:58,330
Any pinching
under the arms, sir?

952
01:08:02,620 --> 01:08:03,939
Maybe you were right,

953
01:08:04,020 --> 01:08:06,250
we should have gone
for 71 meters.

954
01:08:06,380 --> 01:08:09,452
Yes, maybe
you should have.

955
01:08:22,180 --> 01:08:24,375
And where do you think
you're going, young man?

956
01:08:26,700 --> 01:08:28,418
The Olympics.
I know.

957
01:08:31,060 --> 01:08:33,415
I thought you
might need this.

958
01:08:35,660 --> 01:08:37,696
Don't think I'm gonna be
winning any medals, Mum.

959
01:08:37,780 --> 01:08:39,452
Well, you never know, pet.

960
01:08:39,540 --> 01:08:42,054
But if not,
you'll like the sandwiches.

961
01:08:42,580 --> 01:08:43,899
Thank you.

962
01:08:44,020 --> 01:08:46,409
Your dad's sorry
he couldn't come.

963
01:08:48,340 --> 01:08:49,773
Have fun.

964
01:08:50,420 --> 01:08:51,614
I will.

965
01:08:54,580 --> 01:08:56,730
Skis in the back,
Edwards.

966
01:08:57,740 --> 01:08:59,412
He seems nice.

967
01:08:59,860 --> 01:09:01,418
Yeah. Thanks for coming, Mum.

968
01:09:35,540 --> 01:09:37,531
Okay, this guy
right here.

969
01:09:37,660 --> 01:09:39,935
Okay, give me some space,
boys. Give me some space.

970
01:09:41,780 --> 01:09:43,691
I'll catch you
in five, fellas.

971
01:09:45,980 --> 01:09:47,971
Gotta love
them mountains, huh.

972
01:09:48,300 --> 01:09:50,450
Eddie, isn't it? Zach.
I know.

973
01:09:50,580 --> 01:09:52,810
This is my second
Olympics, Eddie.

974
01:09:52,900 --> 01:09:54,094
So I know exactly
how you're feeling.

975
01:09:54,180 --> 01:09:55,738
Little bit overwhelmed,
I imagine, huh?

976
01:09:55,820 --> 01:09:57,299
Just glad to
be here really.

977
01:09:57,380 --> 01:09:58,574
Yeah, I bet.

978
01:09:58,660 --> 01:10:00,616
Listen, I know
Target's not a big fan,

979
01:10:00,700 --> 01:10:02,019
but forget
about him, okay?

980
01:10:02,100 --> 01:10:03,135
You're part
of the team

981
01:10:03,220 --> 01:10:04,448
and that makes you
okay in my book.

982
01:10:04,540 --> 01:10:06,849
In fact we've got a little
team tradition going.

983
01:10:06,940 --> 01:10:08,373
I'd love you to come along.
Come on.

984
01:10:08,500 --> 01:10:10,809
I was gonna have a stroll
and get my bearings.

985
01:10:10,900 --> 01:10:12,458
Your bearings? What do you need to know?
We're in Canada.

986
01:10:12,540 --> 01:10:14,292
You've got mountains
and snow, all right.

987
01:10:14,380 --> 01:10:15,813
Now you've got your bearings.
You're gonna love this.

988
01:10:15,900 --> 01:10:17,299
Let's go.
Hmm, all right.

989
01:10:21,500 --> 01:10:23,616
I don't really
drink, Zach.

990
01:10:23,740 --> 01:10:25,460
Come on, man. Everybody
on the team does it.

991
01:10:25,500 --> 01:10:27,013
Do you wanna put
a curse on us all?

992
01:10:27,100 --> 01:10:28,533
A curse, really?

993
01:10:28,620 --> 01:10:31,259
Look, Eddie.
It's just a thing, okay?

994
01:10:31,380 --> 01:10:33,530
Some of the guys believe it.
It's for good luck...

995
01:10:33,900 --> 01:10:35,618
...but it's
a team tradition, Ed.

996
01:10:36,300 --> 01:10:38,256
And you are part of this team.

997
01:10:41,780 --> 01:10:43,498
To the British team.

998
01:10:43,620 --> 01:10:45,815
There you go,
that's the spirit.

999
01:10:45,900 --> 01:10:47,128
Can I get a lager beer

1000
01:10:47,220 --> 01:10:48,858
and a mineral
water here, please?

1001
01:10:48,980 --> 01:10:50,333
Do I have to do
all five of them?

1002
01:10:50,420 --> 01:10:52,058
Yeah, you bet.

1003
01:10:52,180 --> 01:10:53,852
That's a good choice.
That's absinthe.

1004
01:10:59,220 --> 01:11:01,131
<i>57 nations.</i>

1005
01:11:01,260 --> 01:11:03,694
<i>1,700 athletes.</i>

1006
01:11:03,820 --> 01:11:05,731
<i>60,000 spectators.</i>

1007
01:11:05,860 --> 01:11:08,135
And more than
2 billion TV viewers

1008
01:11:08,260 --> 01:11:09,454
around the globe.

1009
01:11:09,540 --> 01:11:11,292
<i>All have come together</i>

1010
01:11:11,380 --> 01:11:13,689
<i>for the 15th Olympic
Winter Games...</i>

1011
01:11:13,820 --> 01:11:15,173
<i>...where today...</i>

1012
01:11:15,380 --> 01:11:19,293
<i>...the words will be spoken:
"Let the games begin!"</i>

1013
01:11:22,060 --> 01:11:23,129
Where is he?

1014
01:11:23,980 --> 01:11:25,413
I can't see him.

1015
01:11:28,300 --> 01:11:30,860
What are they doing with
those stupid berets on?

1016
01:11:30,980 --> 01:11:33,289
It's all
a bit stupid if you ask me.

1017
01:11:34,660 --> 01:11:36,776
I mean, what have horses
gotta do with skiing?

1018
01:11:42,980 --> 01:11:43,980
Okay.

1019
01:11:48,980 --> 01:11:50,538
Look at this.
I love this guy.

1020
01:11:52,980 --> 01:11:55,255
Wake up, Princess Anne.

1021
01:11:55,580 --> 01:11:57,571
Ah! My head.

1022
01:12:00,260 --> 01:12:01,739
How long have I got?

1023
01:12:01,820 --> 01:12:04,778
Oh, I'm sorry,
it seems like you overslept.

1024
01:12:04,940 --> 01:12:06,055
Yeah. Me and a
couple of the fellas

1025
01:12:06,140 --> 01:12:07,539
just wanted to come down
and thank you

1026
01:12:07,620 --> 01:12:09,531
for helping us
avoid that curse.

1027
01:12:10,820 --> 01:12:12,970
Think I'm about to have
my first fight, ever.

1028
01:12:13,060 --> 01:12:15,733
This is the complaint
I was telling you about.

1029
01:12:17,060 --> 01:12:18,254
What's going on here?

1030
01:12:18,340 --> 01:12:19,659
We're having a team talk.

1031
01:12:20,060 --> 01:12:21,618
Well, I find that
rather surprising

1032
01:12:21,700 --> 01:12:24,339
considering you were not
with the team earlier.

1033
01:12:25,100 --> 01:12:26,772
Any particular reason
you were not with us

1034
01:12:26,860 --> 01:12:28,213
at the ceremony?

1035
01:12:29,420 --> 01:12:30,694
Upset tummy.

1036
01:12:30,780 --> 01:12:33,294
Had to come down
and clean my kit.

1037
01:12:33,860 --> 01:12:36,135
You'd better get your
nerves under control

1038
01:12:36,220 --> 01:12:38,211
otherwise you'll be
jumping in a nappy.

1039
01:12:44,780 --> 01:12:46,816
<i>The crowd
have really come alive</i>

1040
01:12:46,940 --> 01:12:48,658
<i>at the sight
of the Flying Finn.</i>

1041
01:12:48,780 --> 01:12:50,816
Not what you'd call
an accessible figure.

1042
01:12:50,900 --> 01:12:52,891
Prefers to let his
jumping do the talking.

1043
01:12:55,060 --> 01:12:56,971
<i>And here he comes.</i>

1044
01:13:06,820 --> 01:13:09,493
<i>Oh, my word!
This is his first speech.</i>

1045
01:13:09,620 --> 01:13:12,692
<i>That is a big jump.
That is very big.</i>

1046
01:13:13,620 --> 01:13:16,498
<i>It's over 100 meters.
It's 114 meters.</i>

1047
01:13:16,620 --> 01:13:19,214
<i>That is a very
impressive first jump.</i>

1048
01:13:19,340 --> 01:13:20,614
<i>The crowd are on their feet.</i>

1049
01:13:20,780 --> 01:13:22,099
Mr. Edwards?

1050
01:13:22,180 --> 01:13:24,535
<i>Mind you, he doesn't
look very impressed...</i>

1051
01:13:24,660 --> 01:13:26,855
<i>...because he sets himself
very high standards.</i>

1052
01:13:27,260 --> 01:13:29,728
We'll definitely see him
this time, love.

1053
01:13:29,900 --> 01:13:32,368
Yeah, falling on his arse.

1054
01:13:34,100 --> 01:13:35,738
<i>The one participant</i>

1055
01:13:35,820 --> 01:13:37,936
<i>from Great Britain...</i>

1056
01:13:38,020 --> 01:13:40,853
<i>...number 24, Eddie Edwards.</i>

1057
01:13:45,020 --> 01:13:46,453
<i>And here he comes.</i>

1058
01:13:46,540 --> 01:13:49,054
<i>Britain's Michael
"Eddie" Edwards.</i>

1059
01:13:49,540 --> 01:13:51,178
Come on, Eddie.

1060
01:13:51,940 --> 01:13:54,534
Terry, love, he's about to jump.
Come on.

1061
01:13:54,660 --> 01:13:56,730
<i>A relative
newcomer to the sport.</i>

1062
01:13:56,820 --> 01:13:59,050
<i>Not a lot of
information about him.</i>

1063
01:13:59,340 --> 01:14:00,932
<i>He would never
have experienced</i>

1064
01:14:01,020 --> 01:14:03,818
<i>an atmosphere like this
before, that's for sure.</i>

1065
01:14:04,540 --> 01:14:06,371
<i>It'll be the first for me</i>

1066
01:14:06,460 --> 01:14:08,018
<i>to be commentating
on a British...</i>

1067
01:14:08,100 --> 01:14:09,328
...ski-jumper
at the Olympics

1068
01:14:09,420 --> 01:14:11,251
and let's hope
he's the first of many.

1069
01:14:46,660 --> 01:14:48,378
Yes!

1070
01:14:49,740 --> 01:14:50,855
Yes, yes!

1071
01:14:54,700 --> 01:14:57,009
<i>To say that
his style is unorthodox</i>

1072
01:14:57,100 --> 01:14:59,455
<i>would be something
of an understatement...</i>

1073
01:14:59,580 --> 01:15:02,094
<i>...but it obviously
works for him.</i>

1074
01:15:03,700 --> 01:15:08,376
<i>And the scoreboard
shows... 60. 5 meters.</i>

1075
01:15:09,260 --> 01:15:11,649
<i>It is a new
British Olympic record.</i>

1076
01:15:11,740 --> 01:15:13,253
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

1077
01:15:13,380 --> 01:15:15,371
I'm a British record...

1078
01:15:15,500 --> 01:15:18,333
Mum. Mum, I love you.
British record!

1079
01:15:18,420 --> 01:15:19,978
I love you, too, son.

1080
01:15:20,140 --> 01:15:23,496
I'm a British
record holder! Yes!

1081
01:15:29,100 --> 01:15:30,499
Whoo!

1082
01:15:33,660 --> 01:15:35,412
<i>And look at the young man.</i>

1083
01:15:35,700 --> 01:15:37,975
<i>He's overjoyed with himself.</i>

1084
01:15:39,820 --> 01:15:41,697
Oh, and the crowd
are loving this.

1085
01:15:41,780 --> 01:15:43,691
He's really
getting them going.

1086
01:15:49,100 --> 01:15:51,011
Eddie, what are you doing?

1087
01:15:51,100 --> 01:15:52,169
It's not funny. No.

1088
01:16:08,420 --> 01:16:09,739
<i>He may not have
soared like an eagle,</i>

1089
01:16:09,820 --> 01:16:13,335
<i>but he's certainly
flapping around like one.</i>

1090
01:16:13,460 --> 01:16:14,779
Would you believe it?

1091
01:16:14,900 --> 01:16:18,017
Britain's Eddie
"The Eagle" Edwards

1092
01:16:18,100 --> 01:16:19,772
having the time
of his life.

1093
01:16:19,860 --> 01:16:21,896
<i>The crowd have certainly taken</i>

1094
01:16:21,980 --> 01:16:25,052
<i>our Eddie "The Eagle"
to their hearts.</i>

1095
01:16:26,060 --> 01:16:27,379
<i>What a character.</i>

1096
01:16:27,460 --> 01:16:29,540
<i>Looks like that's
the last we'll be seeing</i>

1097
01:16:29,620 --> 01:16:31,895
<i>of Great Britain's
Michael Edwards...</i>

1098
01:16:32,020 --> 01:16:34,693
<i>...as he comes last
in the 70 meter.</i>

1099
01:16:34,780 --> 01:16:36,691
<i>Some people are calling him
Eddie "The Eagle."</i>

1100
01:16:36,780 --> 01:16:38,452
<i>I think, given his distances,</i>

1101
01:16:38,540 --> 01:16:41,418
<i>Eddie "The Penguin"
would be a little more apt.</i>

1102
01:16:41,500 --> 01:16:43,934
<i>But at least we have the
90 meter to look forward to.</i>

1103
01:16:44,060 --> 01:16:45,812
<i>Now this is the event
that truly separates</i>

1104
01:16:45,900 --> 01:16:47,458
<i>the men from the boys.</i>

1105
01:16:47,540 --> 01:16:49,020
<i>Of course, one boy
who won't be there</i>

1106
01:16:49,100 --> 01:16:50,453
<i>is Eddie "The Eagle"...</i>

1107
01:16:50,540 --> 01:16:52,531
<i>...as it's hard
to play up to the crowd</i>

1108
01:16:52,620 --> 01:16:54,372
<i>when you're strapped
to a stretcher.</i>

1109
01:16:54,460 --> 01:16:56,098
<i>But now over
to the bobsleigh event</i>

1110
01:16:56,180 --> 01:16:59,138
<i>where the Jamaican team
are trying to steal Eddie's...</i>

1111
01:17:09,660 --> 01:17:12,458
Michael Edwards,
but everyone calls me Eddie.

1112
01:17:14,740 --> 01:17:16,298
Hmm. Your
name's not here.

1113
01:17:16,620 --> 01:17:19,896
Well, can you check again?
I am on the team.

1114
01:17:20,340 --> 01:17:23,059
You might be on the team
but you're not on the list.

1115
01:17:23,180 --> 01:17:25,694
Appleby, you old dog.
Zach.

1116
01:17:25,820 --> 01:17:27,776
Say hi to your daughter
for me.

1117
01:17:38,220 --> 01:17:40,688
Ah. Eddie, there you are.
I'm Carrie.

1118
01:17:40,860 --> 01:17:42,976
I handle the press
for the British team.

1119
01:17:43,060 --> 01:17:44,618
Been looking all over for you.
Where have you been?

1120
01:17:44,780 --> 01:17:46,771
Here. There's a problem.
I tried to get into the lunch

1121
01:17:46,860 --> 01:17:47,929
but my name's
not on the list.

1122
01:17:48,020 --> 01:17:49,020
Never mind that.

1123
01:17:49,100 --> 01:17:50,249
There's a big
press turn-out

1124
01:17:50,340 --> 01:17:52,376
and they all want
to hear your story.

1125
01:17:52,460 --> 01:17:54,530
Wow. Really?
Yes.

1126
01:17:54,620 --> 01:17:56,019
Now, you must
remember to thank

1127
01:17:56,100 --> 01:17:57,328
the British
Olympic Association

1128
01:17:57,460 --> 01:17:59,451
for all their support.
That's very important.

1129
01:17:59,540 --> 01:18:00,540
Okay.

1130
01:18:00,620 --> 01:18:01,655
Don't be nervous.

1131
01:18:01,740 --> 01:18:03,890
Just be yourself
and try and enjoy it.

1132
01:18:04,020 --> 01:18:05,055
Okay.

1133
01:18:08,060 --> 01:18:11,177
Control yourselves, people.
Everybody sit down.

1134
01:18:11,260 --> 01:18:13,137
One at a time.
Come on, sit down.

1135
01:18:13,260 --> 01:18:16,093
I'd like to introduce you
to Eddie Edwards,

1136
01:18:16,180 --> 01:18:18,774
sometimes known
as Eddie "The Eagle."

1137
01:18:26,860 --> 01:18:28,612
Hello, everybody.

1138
01:18:28,780 --> 01:18:30,300
How long have you
been ski-jumping for?

1139
01:18:30,340 --> 01:18:32,092
Nearly almost a year.

1140
01:18:32,220 --> 01:18:34,893
I'm not sure,
I haven't been counting.

1141
01:18:38,740 --> 01:18:40,220
Do you
have your own skis?

1142
01:18:40,300 --> 01:18:41,733
Do you own your own skis?

1143
01:18:41,860 --> 01:18:44,135
I wasn't told about this.
What the hell is going on?

1144
01:18:44,260 --> 01:18:47,093
It's press. They can't
get enough of him.

1145
01:18:47,260 --> 01:18:49,091
I get so many requests
for interviews.

1146
01:18:49,220 --> 01:18:50,573
He's a PR dream.

1147
01:18:50,700 --> 01:18:53,373
Really? Well it looks
more like a nightmare.

1148
01:18:53,500 --> 01:18:57,493
Wind it up as soon as you can.
We have better things to do.

1149
01:19:01,060 --> 01:19:03,893
Will you do one of your
special eagle flaps for us?

1150
01:19:04,660 --> 01:19:06,537
What, this one?

1151
01:19:06,660 --> 01:19:08,298
<i>Eddie "The Eagle" Edwards</i>

1152
01:19:08,380 --> 01:19:10,848
has divided opinion
here in Calgary.

1153
01:19:10,940 --> 01:19:12,259
Some athletes
and officials

1154
01:19:12,340 --> 01:19:14,729
are questioning
his right to be here.

1155
01:19:15,660 --> 01:19:17,332
Hello, Eddie.

1156
01:19:17,420 --> 01:19:19,809
Clive North. <i>The Sun.</i>

1157
01:19:19,900 --> 01:19:22,858
Now, listen, there's
a hairdresser in Bristol

1158
01:19:22,940 --> 01:19:25,010
claiming that she's
been your lover...

1159
01:19:25,100 --> 01:19:27,091
...for the last
two years.

1160
01:19:28,180 --> 01:19:29,852
Any comment?

1161
01:19:30,260 --> 01:19:32,774
Now, Ron,
as a British commentator,

1162
01:19:32,860 --> 01:19:34,134
what are your thoughts?

1163
01:19:34,220 --> 01:19:36,097
Well, he's earned
his right to be here.

1164
01:19:36,180 --> 01:19:39,411
<i>Love him or hate him, you have to
admire his spirit and determination.</i>

1165
01:19:39,540 --> 01:19:42,452
<i>And let's not forget what the
founder of the Olympic movement,</i>

1166
01:19:42,540 --> 01:19:44,292
<i>Baron de Coubertin said:</i>

1167
01:19:44,420 --> 01:19:46,012
"The most important thing
in the Olympic Games

1168
01:19:46,100 --> 01:19:48,853
"is not to win
but to take part."

1169
01:19:48,940 --> 01:19:50,896
It's not the triumph
but the struggle.

1170
01:19:50,980 --> 01:19:53,414
Got any photos
of yourself as a baby?

1171
01:19:53,500 --> 01:19:55,092
...keep ourselves
lean and mean.

1172
01:19:55,180 --> 01:19:58,695
Make sure the...
Keep the wolf from the door.

1173
01:20:02,260 --> 01:20:03,613
Did you see me on TV?

1174
01:20:03,700 --> 01:20:05,292
Yeah, we all saw you, man.

1175
01:20:05,700 --> 01:20:07,053
<i>And?</i>

1176
01:20:07,380 --> 01:20:08,699
And what?

1177
01:20:08,940 --> 01:20:10,851
And what did you think?

1178
01:20:11,340 --> 01:20:13,535
Still think I made
the wrong decision?

1179
01:20:13,620 --> 01:20:14,848
They love me.

1180
01:20:15,820 --> 01:20:17,538
You confirmed
all my fears, Eddie.

1181
01:20:17,620 --> 01:20:19,099
No-one is taking you
seriously.

1182
01:20:19,180 --> 01:20:20,772
You are nothing
but a side-show.

1183
01:20:22,460 --> 01:20:25,213
And the very minute that
90 meter competition starts

1184
01:20:25,300 --> 01:20:26,619
you'll be forgotten.

1185
01:20:26,740 --> 01:20:28,935
Okay? So enjoy
your 15 minutes of fame.

1186
01:20:32,340 --> 01:20:34,615
Well, don't
hold back, will you.

1187
01:20:34,740 --> 01:20:36,776
<i>You asked for the truth, bud.</i>

1188
01:21:28,780 --> 01:21:29,780
Hello.

1189
01:21:29,860 --> 01:21:31,771
I've got everything ready.
What's going on?

1190
01:21:31,860 --> 01:21:33,339
It's gonna be okay,
I promise.

1191
01:21:33,420 --> 01:21:36,014
I could get into big
trouble for this, Eddie.

1192
01:21:36,140 --> 01:21:37,778
Be fine.
Okay.

1193
01:21:37,900 --> 01:21:39,253
Thank you.

1194
01:21:44,660 --> 01:21:46,332
Thank you all for coming.

1195
01:21:49,740 --> 01:21:51,571
I'm not deluded.

1196
01:21:52,060 --> 01:21:53,459
I know there are
plenty of athletes

1197
01:21:53,540 --> 01:21:56,134
more deserving
of publicity than me.

1198
01:21:56,540 --> 01:21:58,656
And I would like to apologize

1199
01:21:58,780 --> 01:22:01,738
if my silly antics have cast a
shadow over their achievements.

1200
01:22:03,140 --> 01:22:05,335
<i>I also know that
I was messing around</i>

1201
01:22:05,420 --> 01:22:08,935
<i>a little bit after the
70 meter jump the other day.</i>

1202
01:22:11,620 --> 01:22:13,372
I was very excited.

1203
01:22:15,940 --> 01:22:18,852
But I take jumping
very seriously.

1204
01:22:22,940 --> 01:22:24,771
In fact, I love it.

1205
01:22:28,300 --> 01:22:31,610
I love it very nearly as much
as proving people wrong.

1206
01:22:34,620 --> 01:22:38,454
<i>Which is why I've decided
to compete in the 90 meters.</i>

1207
01:22:40,900 --> 01:22:42,015
What?

1208
01:22:43,300 --> 01:22:44,574
Wait, I...

1209
01:22:44,660 --> 01:22:48,209
I know I'd originally only
intended to jump the 70 meters.

1210
01:22:52,420 --> 01:22:55,059
But as people
much wiser than me say...

1211
01:22:56,340 --> 01:23:00,049
...competing in the Olympics doesn't mean
anything if you sell yourself short.

1212
01:23:02,660 --> 01:23:05,094
<i>I didn't come here
as a novelty act.</i>

1213
01:23:07,420 --> 01:23:09,809
And I will not
be going home as one.

1214
01:23:12,380 --> 01:23:13,779
Thank you for your time.

1215
01:23:22,780 --> 01:23:24,736
<i>Let's just say
in the Wild West</i>

1216
01:23:24,820 --> 01:23:26,260
<i>we'd be measuring you
for your coffin</i>

1217
01:23:26,300 --> 01:23:28,211

reach the stairs.</i>

Eddie "The Eagle."

1219
01:23:34,780 --> 01:23:37,453
Yeah, it has kind of
a ring to it, I guess.

1220
01:23:37,860 --> 01:23:38,860
Wow.

1221
01:23:41,860 --> 01:23:43,851
I thought you said
I was a fool.

1222
01:23:43,940 --> 01:23:47,216
Yeah, well, an old friend helped
me see things differently.

1223
01:23:47,300 --> 01:23:48,494
What's with
the fluff, man?

1224
01:23:48,580 --> 01:23:49,900
You having a crisis
of confidence?

1225
01:23:50,020 --> 01:23:51,294
Fluff?
This is a moustache.

1226
01:23:51,380 --> 01:23:52,574
Is that
what you call it?

1227
01:23:52,660 --> 01:23:53,979
Yeah. Nice jacket.

1228
01:23:54,060 --> 01:23:56,210
What happened
to the other one?

1229
01:23:56,380 --> 01:23:58,132
Well, I got rid of it.

1230
01:23:58,980 --> 01:24:00,049
Really?

1231
01:24:01,260 --> 01:24:02,693
For now.

1232
01:24:02,820 --> 01:24:04,697
And it's cold,
let me tell you.

1233
01:24:06,340 --> 01:24:09,138
So is this the bit where
you say "I told you so"?

1234
01:24:09,260 --> 01:24:11,899
No, this is where I say
that without the booze

1235
01:24:11,980 --> 01:24:14,016
I wouldn't even have
the guts to do that jump.

1236
01:24:14,420 --> 01:24:16,809
As your coach,
I think you're crazy.

1237
01:24:16,900 --> 01:24:18,094
I don't know
what I was thinking.

1238
01:24:18,180 --> 01:24:20,375
But as your friend,
I say you gotta do it.

1239
01:24:20,460 --> 01:24:21,654
This is your moment.

1240
01:24:21,740 --> 01:24:22,889
I need a practice jump.

1241
01:24:22,980 --> 01:24:24,652
What do you need to know
you don't know already?

1242
01:24:24,740 --> 01:24:26,059
It's higher than
you've jumped before.

1243
01:24:26,180 --> 01:24:27,818
You're gonna go faster
than you've ever gone before.

1244
01:24:27,900 --> 01:24:29,094
You're gonna
fly farther than

1245
01:24:29,180 --> 01:24:31,216
your tiny little brain
can handle, but...

1246
01:24:31,580 --> 01:24:34,253
...it's just
a jump, man. Simple.

1247
01:24:35,940 --> 01:24:37,498
Eddie, listen.

1248
01:24:39,020 --> 01:24:41,853
You got more dedication,
you got more heart and spirit

1249
01:24:41,940 --> 01:24:43,817
than any of those other
jumpers out there.

1250
01:24:43,900 --> 01:24:44,969
Any of them.

1251
01:24:45,060 --> 01:24:46,060
Jesus, I spent six months

1252
01:24:46,140 --> 01:24:48,256
trying to get rid
of you, dude.

1253
01:24:48,380 --> 01:24:51,213
You're like gum on my shoe,
you never gave up.

1254
01:24:51,340 --> 01:24:54,696
I mean, are you gonna
give up now, at the Olympics?

1255
01:24:56,780 --> 01:24:58,532
This is your moment.

1256
01:25:00,020 --> 01:25:02,011
You're Eddie
"The Eagle," man.

1257
01:25:04,260 --> 01:25:06,979
Proud of you.
I'm proud of myself.

1258
01:25:07,140 --> 01:25:09,415
That's very modest,
Peary.

1259
01:25:09,540 --> 01:25:11,098
You do realize
that smoking cigarettes

1260
01:25:11,180 --> 01:25:14,252
is a lot more dangerous
than jumping the 90 meters?

1261
01:25:20,140 --> 01:25:22,290
90 meters,
what is that in feet?

1262
01:25:24,060 --> 01:25:28,292
I dunno, about 300.
No, actually, it's about 295.

1263
01:25:28,420 --> 01:25:30,012
Oh, my God.

1264
01:25:41,540 --> 01:25:43,860
I wanna hear you at the back
of the stands, all right, man?

1265
01:25:43,900 --> 01:25:45,618
Okay, if you're
not yelling it,

1266
01:25:45,700 --> 01:25:47,418
you're not selling it.

1267
01:25:51,820 --> 01:25:53,936
You're quite
a popular guy, Eagle-Man.

1268
01:25:54,060 --> 01:25:55,540
Every time you turn
on TV you're there.

1269
01:25:55,580 --> 01:25:58,140
Yeah. Maybe perhaps
you can tell us,

1270
01:25:58,220 --> 01:25:59,414
what's the secret?

1271
01:26:00,020 --> 01:26:01,339
Clothes.

1272
01:26:02,820 --> 01:26:04,492
<i>...underneath
the landing area making it</i>

1273
01:26:04,580 --> 01:26:06,298
<i>harder and more
dangerous than usual.</i>

1274
01:26:06,380 --> 01:26:07,733
Can't we watch
<i>It's A Knockout?</i>

1275
01:26:07,820 --> 01:26:11,017
I'll knock you out if you
turn that channel over.

1276
01:26:12,260 --> 01:26:14,376
Just remember, you're gonna
land really hard on this jump.

1277
01:26:14,460 --> 01:26:17,179
When your skis hit the slopes,
you gotta keep your butt up.

1278
01:26:18,820 --> 01:26:21,618
<i>Oh! That is
a very nasty crash.</i>

1279
01:26:21,700 --> 01:26:24,976
<i>Oh, no, he won't be
walking away from that.</i>

1280
01:26:25,660 --> 01:26:28,094
<i>I can see the paramedics
rushing to give him help.</i>

1281
01:26:28,220 --> 01:26:29,733
Otherwise you're
gonna be joining him.

1282
01:26:29,820 --> 01:26:31,048
<i>Well, that may not be</i>

1283
01:26:31,180 --> 01:26:33,410
<i>the only wipe-out
we see today...</i>

1284
01:26:33,500 --> 01:26:35,809
<i>...not with Britain's
Eddie "The Eagle" Edwards</i>

1285
01:26:35,900 --> 01:26:37,891
<i>coming up soon.</i>

1286
01:26:38,060 --> 01:26:40,972
<i>Eddie's coach is none other
than Bronson Peary...</i>

1287
01:26:41,100 --> 01:26:44,251
<i>...fallen whiz-kid
of '70s ski-jumping.</i>

1288
01:26:44,900 --> 01:26:47,414
And a former Olympic
squad member of yours,

1289
01:26:47,500 --> 01:26:48,933
if I'm not mistaken,
Warren.

1290
01:26:49,020 --> 01:26:51,978
Well, we spent
some years together, yes.

1291
01:26:52,100 --> 01:26:53,328
What do you think about

1292
01:26:53,420 --> 01:26:55,695
<i>his unconventional
return to the sport?</i>

1293
01:26:55,820 --> 01:26:58,175
<i>In jumping
there's an expression...</i>

1294
01:26:59,060 --> 01:27:00,891
<i>..."You're never
bigger than the hill."</i>

1295
01:27:00,980 --> 01:27:03,733
<i>And that was
Bronson Peary to a tee.</i>

1296
01:27:05,380 --> 01:27:07,735
<i>I never could deal with that.
It broke us apart...</i>

1297
01:27:07,860 --> 01:27:11,455
<i>...because, as a young man,
he had such talent.</i>

1298
01:27:13,140 --> 01:27:14,778
<i>Technique, flair.</i>

1299
01:27:14,900 --> 01:27:17,255
<i>Everything but discipline.</i>

1300
01:27:18,740 --> 01:27:21,652
<i>As a jumper
he was so disrespectful...</i>

1301
01:27:21,780 --> 01:27:24,089
...of the sport
that I'm afraid he's gonna do

1302
01:27:24,180 --> 01:27:26,455
the same thing now as a coach.

1303
01:27:28,300 --> 01:27:29,938
<i>Thank you, Warren.</i>

1304
01:27:30,020 --> 01:27:32,534
<i>Certainly sharp words
from Warren Sharp...</i>

1305
01:27:32,980 --> 01:27:34,732
No pressure there, then.

1306
01:27:34,860 --> 01:27:36,851
Where's my jacket
when I need it, huh?

1307
01:27:36,980 --> 01:27:38,015
Edwards!

1308
01:27:40,220 --> 01:27:41,812
I'm Edwards.

1309
01:27:50,420 --> 01:27:52,172
You all right?
Yeah, fine.

1310
01:27:53,940 --> 01:27:55,419
You all right?

1311
01:27:55,540 --> 01:27:56,689
Yeah.

1312
01:27:56,780 --> 01:27:57,780
Good.

1313
01:27:58,860 --> 01:28:00,452
Let's do this.

1314
01:28:10,100 --> 01:28:11,658
Eddie "The Eagle."

1315
01:28:11,780 --> 01:28:13,418
Eddie "The Eagle."

1316
01:28:23,620 --> 01:28:25,338
For you. Not for them.

1317
01:28:25,700 --> 01:28:28,009
Just relax, man.
Forget about the numbers,

1318
01:28:28,100 --> 01:28:30,136
just remember
your fundamentals.

1319
01:28:30,220 --> 01:28:31,619
Don't worry
about how far.

1320
01:28:31,700 --> 01:28:35,090
Just up, back, forward, down.
Okay? Up, back, forward, down.

1321
01:28:35,220 --> 01:28:36,699
You got this.
Peary.

1322
01:28:37,940 --> 01:28:39,612
It's gonna be all right.

1323
01:28:40,100 --> 01:28:41,772
Bo Derek, all or nothing.

1324
01:28:42,340 --> 01:28:44,171
Give it both barrels, man.

1325
01:28:45,140 --> 01:28:46,619
See you at the bottom.

1326
01:29:45,940 --> 01:29:48,408
Jumping is all
that matters.

1327
01:29:48,540 --> 01:29:49,893
If I didn't jump,

1328
01:29:49,980 --> 01:29:52,540
I would drink and have
sex all the time.

1329
01:29:54,820 --> 01:29:56,811
Hey, congratulations
on your medal.

1330
01:29:57,180 --> 01:30:00,889
I win gold but
I didn't do my best.

1331
01:30:01,620 --> 01:30:02,814
You see,
if I've done my best

1332
01:30:02,900 --> 01:30:05,539
I can come last
and be happier.

1333
01:30:07,300 --> 01:30:08,415
Like me?

1334
01:30:08,500 --> 01:30:10,058
You do not do good.

1335
01:30:11,020 --> 01:30:12,658
No, I suppose not.

1336
01:30:15,500 --> 01:30:17,252
You've done better.

1337
01:30:17,620 --> 01:30:18,620
Yeah.

1338
01:30:21,740 --> 01:30:23,458
Do you think
I'm being patronizing?

1339
01:30:23,580 --> 01:30:24,899
No, no, no.

1340
01:30:25,340 --> 01:30:27,535
You and I...
You and I are like

1341
01:30:27,620 --> 01:30:29,497
1 o'clock and 11 o'clock.

1342
01:30:29,620 --> 01:30:32,453
You see we are closer to
each other than to others.

1343
01:30:32,580 --> 01:30:33,580
Winning, losing,

1344
01:30:33,660 --> 01:30:36,049
all that stuff
is for the little people.

1345
01:30:36,140 --> 01:30:39,576
Men like us, we jump
to free our souls.

1346
01:30:40,340 --> 01:30:41,489
We are the
only two jumpers

1347
01:30:41,580 --> 01:30:43,172
with a chance
to make history today.

1348
01:30:43,260 --> 01:30:44,693
If we do less
than our best

1349
01:30:44,780 --> 01:30:46,896
with the whole world
watching...

1350
01:30:49,180 --> 01:30:50,932
...it will kill us inside.

1351
01:30:55,980 --> 01:30:57,538
For all time.

1352
01:31:00,100 --> 01:31:01,772
Good luck, Matti.

1353
01:31:21,460 --> 01:31:24,657
<i>On to gate number 49,</i>

1354
01:31:24,740 --> 01:31:27,459
<i>Matti Nykanen from Finland.</i>

1355
01:31:27,780 --> 01:31:30,135
<i>And here
he comes, Matti Nykanen...</i>

1356
01:31:30,220 --> 01:31:31,733
...the Flying Finn.

1357
01:31:31,820 --> 01:31:33,697
The youngest
World Champion ever...

1358
01:31:33,780 --> 01:31:36,852
<i>...and on his day,
the most supreme...</i>

1359
01:31:36,980 --> 01:31:39,050
...jumper the sport
has ever seen.

1360
01:31:49,140 --> 01:31:51,290
<i>He makes it look
so effortless.</i>

1361
01:31:51,380 --> 01:31:52,580
<i>And that's it.</i>

1362
01:31:52,620 --> 01:31:55,054
<i>Olympic history
has been made today.</i>

1363
01:31:55,140 --> 01:31:58,212
<i>The crowd rise
to acclaim the champion.</i>

1364
01:32:02,740 --> 01:32:05,618
<i>Now,
up next for the 90 meter</i>

1365
01:32:05,700 --> 01:32:07,418
<i>from Great Britain...</i>

1366
01:32:07,820 --> 01:32:11,859
<i>...number 24, Eddie Edwards.</i>

1367
01:32:12,020 --> 01:32:13,578
Come on.

1368
01:32:29,100 --> 01:32:30,420
<i>By virtue of the fact</i>

1369
01:32:30,460 --> 01:32:32,371
<i>that he jumped the 70 meter...</i>

1370
01:32:32,540 --> 01:32:34,656
<i>...Edwards qualified
for the 90 meter</i>

1371
01:32:34,740 --> 01:32:37,459
<i>which should prove
quite spectacular.</i>

1372
01:32:38,060 --> 01:32:39,652
<i>As I'm informed,
he's never jumped</i>

1373
01:32:39,740 --> 01:32:41,651
<i>the 90 meter before.</i>

1374
01:32:47,860 --> 01:32:50,454
<i>Eddie,
you are not an athlete!</i>

1375
01:32:59,820 --> 01:33:03,529
Come on, man, just go, go, go.
What are you doing?

1376
01:33:05,100 --> 01:33:06,169
<i>You tried your best</i>

1377
01:33:06,260 --> 01:33:08,410
<i>but it wasn't
good enough, was it?</i>

1378
01:33:12,060 --> 01:33:14,733
Don't tell me
he's freezing up.

1379
01:33:14,860 --> 01:33:17,010
He hasn't got much time left.
Come on, Eddie.

1380
01:33:17,140 --> 01:33:18,653
What's he doing?

1381
01:33:19,740 --> 01:33:21,651
<i>What's he doing up there?</i>

1382
01:33:21,940 --> 01:33:23,300
<i>Seems to be having
second thoughts.</i>

1383
01:33:23,340 --> 01:33:24,739
<i>Surely he's gonna jump.</i>

1384
01:33:28,260 --> 01:33:31,570
<i>You will never
be Olympic material.</i>

1385
01:33:33,460 --> 01:33:34,688
Edwards.

1386
01:33:58,660 --> 01:33:59,695
Push!

1387
01:34:08,820 --> 01:34:10,538
Up and out. Up and out.

1388
01:34:12,700 --> 01:34:14,531
No, release, release.
Come on, release!

1389
01:34:43,900 --> 01:34:45,015
Oh! He seems to have
lost it in the flight.

1390
01:34:45,100 --> 01:34:46,740
Not sure how he's gonna
make this landing.

1391
01:34:54,820 --> 01:34:56,412
<i>He's down.</i>

1392
01:34:57,740 --> 01:35:00,049
<i>No, he's on his back.
Can he recover?</i>

1393
01:35:00,180 --> 01:35:01,932
<i>Come on, Eddie.</i>

1394
01:35:18,340 --> 01:35:19,455
Yes!

1395
01:35:21,740 --> 01:35:24,129
Yes!

1396
01:35:31,340 --> 01:35:34,298
<i>He's made it! Unbelievable!</i>

1397
01:35:34,740 --> 01:35:36,970
Yes!

1398
01:35:39,620 --> 01:35:42,009
I've been waiting
a long time to say this,

1399
01:35:42,100 --> 01:35:43,692
well, here goes...

1400
01:35:43,780 --> 01:35:46,453
...The Eagle has landed.

1401
01:35:50,300 --> 01:35:53,975
Eddie "The Eagle."
Eddie "The Eagle."

1402
01:35:59,780 --> 01:36:01,293
<i>But it's a personal best</i>

1403
01:36:01,380 --> 01:36:03,052
<i>in competition for Edwards.</i>

1404
01:36:03,140 --> 01:36:05,973
<i>71.5 meters...</i>

1405
01:36:06,620 --> 01:36:11,375
...and that is a new
British Olympic record!

1406
01:36:33,740 --> 01:36:35,458
Good man.
Come here.

1407
01:36:37,220 --> 01:36:38,938
Yes!
Yes!

1408
01:36:45,180 --> 01:36:46,408
Hey, hey...

1409
01:36:52,340 --> 01:36:53,773
You were down here.
How did you not fall?

1410
01:36:53,860 --> 01:36:54,895
It was unbelievable.

1411
01:36:54,980 --> 01:36:56,698
I have never gone
that far before.

1412
01:36:58,260 --> 01:37:00,569
To see 71 meters
it was like...

1413
01:37:20,300 --> 01:37:22,256
Is that a good book?

1414
01:37:27,060 --> 01:37:28,652
Instructive?

1415
01:37:29,500 --> 01:37:30,535
Very.

1416
01:37:32,580 --> 01:37:34,059
May I?

1417
01:37:45,260 --> 01:37:46,260
You...

1418
01:37:47,900 --> 01:37:48,900
...brilliant.

1419
01:37:50,500 --> 01:37:52,092
Well done.

1420
01:37:56,580 --> 01:37:58,252
I was wrong...

1421
01:38:03,780 --> 01:38:05,259
...about you.

1422
01:38:13,140 --> 01:38:14,493
Champion.

1423
01:38:27,340 --> 01:38:29,934
<i>You have
broken world records.</i>

1424
01:38:30,060 --> 01:38:31,209
<i>You have established</i>

1425
01:38:31,300 --> 01:38:33,734
many of your own
personal bests...

1426
01:38:33,900 --> 01:38:37,131
...and some of you have
even soared like an eagle.

1427
01:38:46,500 --> 01:38:48,491
<i>It was so flattering.</i>

1428
01:38:48,980 --> 01:38:50,538
I wasn't expecting
that at all.

1429
01:38:50,620 --> 01:38:53,976
Yeah. Well,
I think I can match that.

1430
01:38:56,900 --> 01:38:59,892
"Now the real work begins.
WS." Warren Sharp.

1431
01:38:59,980 --> 01:39:01,174
Yeah. Yeah.

1432
01:39:01,980 --> 01:39:05,495
So how about it?
Here's to the next four years.

1433
01:39:10,500 --> 01:39:11,979
Ah.
Ugh.

1434
01:39:12,060 --> 01:39:13,732
God, that's good.

1435
01:39:29,140 --> 01:39:30,289
Hello, Mum.

1436
01:39:30,460 --> 01:39:31,939
Hello.

1437
01:39:32,020 --> 01:39:33,660
Where do you think
you've been, young man?

1438
01:39:33,900 --> 01:39:36,130
Competing
in the Olympics, Mum.

1439
01:39:57,060 --> 01:39:58,573
I'm so proud of you, son.

1440
01:39:59,420 --> 01:40:02,537
I mean that.
I'm so proud of you, mate.

1441
01:40:02,900 --> 01:40:04,492
Thanks, Dad.

1442
01:40:34,740 --> 01:40:36,332
So proud of you, man.

1443
01:40:55,300 --> 01:40:57,575
<i>I'm shouting</i>

1444
01:40:57,660 --> 01:41:01,096
<i>Don't care who is listening</i>

1445
01:41:01,180 --> 01:41:04,616
<i>Don't live here,
I'm visiting</i>

1446
01:41:04,700 --> 01:41:08,773
<i>To go where I've never been</i>

1447
01:41:08,860 --> 01:41:11,499
<i>I'm reaching</i>

1448
01:41:11,580 --> 01:41:15,255
<i>'Cause this isn't far enough</i>

1449
01:41:15,340 --> 01:41:18,776
<i>There's more
in this heart than love</i>

1450
01:41:18,900 --> 01:41:23,371
<i>Won 't stop
till I'm high above</i>

1451
01:41:23,460 --> 01:41:26,850
<i>I'm cursed with anticipation</i>

1452
01:41:26,940 --> 01:41:30,489
<i>I have no time
for conversation</i>

1453
01:41:30,620 --> 01:41:35,136
<i>Look at me,
I'm free to do what I want</i>

1454
01:41:35,220 --> 01:41:37,529
<i>What I want</i>

1455
01:41:37,620 --> 01:41:41,056
<i>Come on, thrill me
Come on, kill me</i>

1456
01:41:41,140 --> 01:41:44,450
<i>Feel the blood rush
Round the body</i>

1457
01:41:44,540 --> 01:41:47,930
<i>Can 't hold it in
and I can't fight it</i>

1458
01:41:48,020 --> 01:41:51,649
<i>Can 't turn away
and I can't hide it</i>

1459
01:41:51,740 --> 01:41:55,176
<i>Come on, find me
Come on, blind me</i>

1460
01:41:55,260 --> 01:41:58,730
<i>Look, the fear
is far behind me</i>

1461
01:41:58,820 --> 01:42:02,176
<i>What was just a dream
now will be</i>

1462
01:42:02,260 --> 01:42:05,809
<i>I'm calling to the world,
Come on, come on, thrill me</i>

1463
01:42:18,460 --> 01:42:20,815
<i>Come on, thrill me</i>

1464
01:42:20,900 --> 01:42:24,734
<i>I feel alive
when you're with me</i>

1465
01:42:24,820 --> 01:42:28,529
<i>I feel the endless
possibilities</i>

1466
01:42:28,620 --> 01:42:31,817
<i>You give me something
You give me something</i>

1467
01:42:31,900 --> 01:42:35,734
<i>You give me everything</i>

1468
01:42:35,820 --> 01:42:39,210
<i>And I will make it
all worth it</i>

1469
01:42:39,300 --> 01:42:43,088
<i>Yeah, I will reach
the summit white as snow</i>

1470
01:42:43,180 --> 01:42:46,252
<i>You make me wanna
You make me wanna</i>

1471
01:42:46,340 --> 01:42:49,298
<i>You make me wanna be yours</i>

1472
01:42:49,380 --> 01:42:53,009
<i>'Cause we were honestly</i>

1473
01:42:53,100 --> 01:42:56,615
<i>We were nothing
more than each other</i>

1474
01:42:56,700 --> 01:43:00,136
<i>But I needed you
Yeah, I needed you</i>

1475
01:43:00,220 --> 01:43:04,611
<i>Like you needed me</i>

1476
01:43:05,540 --> 01:43:08,816
<i>Learning to fly
Out of the sky</i>

1477
01:43:08,900 --> 01:43:12,734
<i>Traveling high
Learning to fly</i>

1478
01:43:12,820 --> 01:43:16,051
<i>All over town
I'm coming down</i>

1479
01:43:16,140 --> 01:43:19,974
<i>Out of the sky
For you</i>

1480
01:43:20,060 --> 01:43:23,416
<i>Learning to fly
Out of the sky</i>

1481
01:43:23,500 --> 01:43:27,334
<i>Out of the sky
I'm on a ride</i>

1482
01:43:27,420 --> 01:43:30,890
<i>All over town
I'm coming down</i>

1483
01:43:30,980 --> 01:43:34,768
<i>Learning to fly
For you</i>

1484
01:43:34,860 --> 01:43:39,138
<i>I can see the eagle landing</i>

1485
01:43:41,660 --> 01:43:45,050
<i>It's all I wanna do now</i>

1486
01:43:45,180 --> 01:43:49,970
<i>Didn 't think
I'd ever get so high</i>

1487
01:44:01,660 --> 01:44:05,972
<i>Take me to that
hallowed ground</i>

1488
01:44:08,500 --> 01:44:13,096
<i>High above
So safe and sound</i>

1489
01:44:15,420 --> 01:44:21,177
<i>Do your best
to clip my wings</i>

1490
01:44:21,260 --> 01:44:27,699
<i>You see, my skin
is thicker than you think</i>

1491
01:44:27,780 --> 01:44:31,295
<i>So I lock away that madness</i>

1492
01:44:31,380 --> 01:44:34,770
<i>Keep emotion in a tight fist</i>

1493
01:44:34,860 --> 01:44:41,698
<i>Gonna hold my head up high
until I reach the summit</i>

1494
01:44:45,380 --> 01:44:49,771
<i>Ascension</i>

1495
01:44:51,940 --> 01:44:56,775
<i>Just sky holding me</i>

1496
01:44:58,340 --> 01:45:01,650
<i>Oh to rise like an angel</i>

1497
01:45:01,740 --> 01:45:05,335
<i>Just to kiss every star</i>

1498
01:45:05,460 --> 01:45:08,532
<i>See the cloud's
silver lining</i>

1499
01:45:08,620 --> 01:45:12,056
<i>Flying high and far</i>

1500
01:45:12,140 --> 01:45:18,010
<i>Oh, ascension</i>

1501
01:45:19,380 --> 01:45:24,659
<i>Ascension</i>
