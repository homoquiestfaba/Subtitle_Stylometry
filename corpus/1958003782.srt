Yeah, she's great.

Oh, okay. You're a student.

Nice. What's your, um... [smacks lips]
What's your thesis topic?

- Slowly. Very slowly.

- Let me see if I have enough cash.
- [chuckles] It's fine. It's fine.

51

You know what?
Actually just, um, take the book.

52
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:10,792
No, I couldn't.

53
00:04:10,876 --> 00:04:13,545
- What if someone else came in looking...
- They can order it online. [chuckles]

54
00:04:13,629 --> 00:04:16,048
Or whatever. I-It's fine.
You can come back and pay for it later.

55
00:04:17,716 --> 00:04:19,593
- Thank you. I... [chuckles]
- Yeah.

56

Uh, got your money.

65
00:04:54,795 --> 00:04:56,630
Oh, you didn't have to do that today.

66
00:04:56,713 --> 00:04:58,215
I didn't wanna leave you hanging.

Okay. Uh, well. See ya.

71
00:05:10,269 --> 00:05:11,854
- All right. Yeah.
- Yeah.

72
00:05:11,937 --> 00:05:13,272
- Have a good one.
- You too.

73
00:05:21,405 --> 00:05:23,073
- Hey. [chuckles]
- Hello. [chuckles]

74
00:05:23,574 --> 00:05:26,118
So, remember this morning
when you asked me out to dinner?

75
00:05:26,201 --> 00:05:28,620
- Oh, yeah. I-I'm sorry. I didn't mean to...
- Oh! No, no, no.

76
00:05:28,704 --> 00:05:31,582
I... I actually wanted to say yes.

77
00:05:31,665 --> 00:05:33,667
[chuckles] I was standing there

78
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:35,460
thinking how nice it would be
if this guy asked me out,

79
00:05:35,544 --> 00:05:37,421
and right as I thought it, you did.
And I...

80
00:05:37,921 --> 00:05:40,048
I don't know. I panicked.

81
00:05:40,716 --> 00:05:41,884
You panicked?

82
00:05:41,967 --> 00:05:43,927
I panicked. [chuckles]

83
00:05:45,053 --> 00:05:46,221
I'm Sandra.

84
00:05:47,139 --> 00:05:48,390
Tom.

85
00:05:48,891 --> 00:05:50,100
Nice to meet you, Tom.

86
00:05:52,102 --> 00:05:53,103
Nice to meet you.

87
00:05:54,438 --> 00:05:57,191
- So, Mott Street?
- Yeah. If that... Yeah.

88
00:05:58,192 --> 00:06:00,068
- Okay. Yeah. Okay.
- This way.

89
00:06:00,152 --> 00:06:01,403
Uh…

90
00:06:01,486 --> 00:06:03,155
- You... After you. Yeah.
- All right. [chuckles]

91
00:06:03,238 --> 00:06:04,865
- [laughs]
- I... I have my bag.

92
00:06:04,948 --> 00:06:07,743
No, I do too. It's getting kind of cold.
[speaks indistinctly]

93
00:06:08,619 --> 00:06:09,620
- That...
- Sorry… [indistinct]

94
00:06:09,703 --> 00:06:10,829
- Backpack buddies.
- Buddies. [laughs]

95
00:06:10,913 --> 00:06:14,082
[Tom] Yeah, and, like,
what have I gotten myself into?

96
00:06:14,166 --> 00:06:16,376
You know?
Like, a short story is one thing.

97
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:19,922
- A novel, that's, like, 300 pages and...
- I know. And sometimes more.

98
00:06:20,005 --> 00:06:22,633
Exactly. And, you know, here they are
offering me real money, you know?

99
00:06:22,716 --> 00:06:24,009
I have to deliver something.

100
00:06:24,092 --> 00:06:28,055
- So, what'd you do?
- I-I had a year-long panic attack, and I…

101
00:06:28,138 --> 00:06:29,806
- [chuckles]
- …I wrote this book that was terrible.

102
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:31,683
Come on. [laughs]
I'm sure it wasn't that bad.

103
00:06:31,767 --> 00:06:34,186
No, no, it was bad. It was... It was awful.
They wouldn't publish it.

104
00:06:35,062 --> 00:06:36,188
Ouch.

105
00:06:36,271 --> 00:06:37,272
- Yeah.
- Sorry.

106
00:06:37,356 --> 00:06:39,816
No, it's fine. I... You know,
at least I got to keep the advance.

107
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,611
Do you still write?

108
00:06:42,694 --> 00:06:44,530
No. Not really.

109
00:06:45,364 --> 00:06:47,866
You know, all-all this happened
around the time that my mom died, and...

110
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:50,661
I don't know, I-I...

111
00:06:50,744 --> 00:06:54,748
Things got dark for me,
and I kinda just gave up.

112
00:06:57,417 --> 00:06:59,086
My parents died when I was a kid.

113
00:07:01,505 --> 00:07:02,589
I'm sorry to hear that.

114
00:07:04,383 --> 00:07:05,384
Must've been tough.

115
00:07:08,554 --> 00:07:10,514
Anyway, um, yeah.

116
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:12,766
I started managing the bookstore.

117
00:07:13,267 --> 00:07:15,978
That kinda pulled me out
of my depression, or whatever.

118
00:07:16,061 --> 00:07:18,939
And… [inhales deeply]
…yeah, it takes up most of my time.

119
00:07:19,022 --> 00:07:20,983
Must be nice being surrounded
by books all day.

120
00:07:22,401 --> 00:07:23,861
- It's the best.
- [laughs]

121
00:07:26,655 --> 00:07:28,156
After my parents passed,

122
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:31,827
my brother and I hopped
from one foster family to the next.

123
00:07:32,744 --> 00:07:34,246
One point,
we were staying with this couple

124
00:07:34,329 --> 00:07:36,456
that had this great collection of novels.

125
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:41,336
And one night, I started reading
<i>Jane Eyre,</i> and-and here was this character

126
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:43,589
that was, sort of, going through
everything I was going through.

127
00:07:43,672 --> 00:07:46,550
And I didn't want it to end.

128
00:07:47,384 --> 00:07:50,929
I finished it, went back to page one
and started reading it all over again.

129
00:07:53,015 --> 00:07:54,600
Just loved books ever since.

130
00:07:56,226 --> 00:07:57,227
<i>Jane Eyre,</i> huh?

131
00:07:58,896 --> 00:07:59,897
<i>Jane Eyre.</i>

132
00:08:02,941 --> 00:08:04,026
Can I show you something?

133
00:08:06,278 --> 00:08:08,155
[shopkeeper bell jingles]

134
00:08:09,156 --> 00:08:10,157
[Sandra giggles]

135
00:08:20,459 --> 00:08:23,253
Oh. [chuckles]

136
00:08:52,115 --> 00:08:53,158
Oh, my God.

137
00:08:54,618 --> 00:08:56,453
- Is this a first edition?
- [Tom] Mm-hmm.

138
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:00,123
Is this real?

139
00:09:02,584 --> 00:09:03,585
This is real.

140
00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:09,424
How can I be sure?

141
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:20,853
["I Won't Let You Down" playing]

142
00:09:28,026 --> 00:09:29,194
[laughs]

143
00:09:29,278 --> 00:09:31,822
<i>I mean, some of these professors
are so obnoxious.</i>

144
00:09:31,905 --> 00:09:35,951
Actually used the phrase
"the vaginization of German literature."

145
00:09:36,034 --> 00:09:37,411
- The what?
- I mean, I'm pretty sure

146
00:09:37,494 --> 00:09:39,538
- "vaginization" isn't even a real word.
- [laughs]

147
00:09:41,373 --> 00:09:42,791
[Tom] Where'd you learn how to cook?

148
00:09:42,875 --> 00:09:44,626
[Sandra] I spent my junior year
in Florence.

149
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:46,461
[Tom, in Italian] <i>Do you speak Italian?</i>

150
00:09:46,962 --> 00:09:48,589
[Sandra] <i>I used to speak it well,</i>

151
00:09:48,672 --> 00:09:51,633
- now it's a bit rusty, unfortunately.
- [Tom, in English] Hello!

152
00:09:51,717 --> 00:09:53,051
- [Sandra] Hello!
- [Tom, in Italian] <i>Did you like Italy?</i>

153
00:09:53,135 --> 00:09:54,261
[laughs]

154
00:09:55,137 --> 00:09:56,555
[Sandra] <i>I have great memories.</i>

155
00:09:56,638 --> 00:09:57,931
[Tom, in English] This is amazing!

156
00:09:58,015 --> 00:10:01,268
[Sandra, in Italian] But, I had
this boyfriend who was a real jerk.

157
00:10:02,853 --> 00:10:04,396
- [bites]
- [laughs]

158
00:10:06,732 --> 00:10:09,318
And what about you?
Where did you learn to speak Italian?

159
00:10:09,401 --> 00:10:11,528
My mom was from Italy.

160
00:10:12,029 --> 00:10:14,823
- And I watch a lot of Fellini movies.
- [Sandra] <i>Oh, I love Fellini.</i>

161
00:10:14,907 --> 00:10:15,866

163
00:10:19,786 --> 00:10:21,872
[Tom] <i>Uh…</i> [chuckles] …yeah, once or twice.

164
00:10:46,396 --> 00:10:47,648
I really like you.

165
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,281
Okay.

166
00:11:02,496 --> 00:11:03,705
I really like you too.

167
00:11:08,585 --> 00:11:09,586
Okay.

168
00:11:12,673 --> 00:11:14,174
- [person] Just hear me out.
- [Sandra] No, just... No, I can't.

169
00:11:14,258 --> 00:11:16,343
- [person] I need your help.
- I'm not doing this.

170

- What do you mean you're not doing this?
- [Sandra] I can't.

171
00:11:18,095 --> 00:11:20,013
[person] It's me and you.
It's me and you against the world,

172
00:11:20,097 --> 00:11:21,682
- do you remember that?
- Can you please just go?

173
00:11:21,765 --> 00:11:23,934
- It's me and you against the world.
- Jason, I need you to stop.

174
00:11:24,017 --> 00:11:26,854
Please, I need you. Don't walk out
on me. You are the last thing that I have

175
00:11:26,937 --> 00:11:28,355
- on this earth. You are the last person...
- Jason!

176
00:11:28,438 --> 00:11:30,691
- [Jason yelps, bangs on door] Sandra!
- Jason, please don't.

177
00:11:30,774 --> 00:11:32,484
[Jason banging on door] Sandra!

178
00:11:32,568 --> 00:11:33,944
- Just go. Just go.
- Please.

179
00:11:34,027 --> 00:11:36,947
[Jason] Please open the door.
Sandra, Sandra, open the door.

180
00:11:38,031 --> 00:11:40,534
Fuck! Fuck!

181
00:11:42,035 --> 00:11:43,161
Fucking bitch.

182
00:11:43,245 --> 00:11:44,580
[Jason descending stairs]

183
00:11:46,206 --> 00:11:48,667
- [Tom] Are you okay?
- [inhales sharply, breathing shakily]

184
00:11:50,002 --> 00:11:51,003
Who was that?

185
00:11:53,922 --> 00:11:55,465
It's my brother. He needs money.

186
00:11:55,549 --> 00:11:56,383
[breathing shakily]

187
00:11:59,219 --> 00:12:00,596
Jason wasn't so lucky.

188
00:12:02,347 --> 00:12:03,932
Some of the homes he was put in were…

189
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:07,686
a nightmare.

190
00:12:08,604 --> 00:12:09,897
It's not your fault.

191
00:12:10,606 --> 00:12:11,607
[sighs]

192
00:12:12,482 --> 00:12:15,777
I know, but he's the only family I got.

193
00:12:17,154 --> 00:12:20,115
[inhales sharply]
"All happy families are alike."

194
00:12:20,199 --> 00:12:22,159
- [sighs] And all that.
- [chuckles]

195
00:12:24,995 --> 00:12:28,165
No matter how many times
he screws me over, I can't not help him.

196
00:12:29,166 --> 00:12:32,127
He's my brother. I love him.

[guest 3] <i>So, how long have you known Tom?</i>

205
00:12:57,694 --> 00:12:59,696
Just a few weeks.

206
00:13:00,739 --> 00:13:04,952
- Seems like so much longer.
- Yeah, I know. It's been kind of intense.

207
00:13:05,035 --> 00:13:08,580
She's like a sexy librarian or something.
[chuckles]

208
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:14,878
- She's... She's literally your dream girl.
- I know. She's just incredible.

209
00:13:14,962 --> 00:13:16,964
- Where did you go to undergrad?
- Uh, Vassar.

210
00:13:17,881 --> 00:13:19,550
Oh, my God. [laughs] So did I.

211
00:13:20,467 --> 00:13:22,928
You know, I thought you looked familiar.
When did you graduate?

212
00:13:23,011 --> 00:13:24,012
Class of '14.

213
00:13:24,096 --> 00:13:25,097
Class of '16.

214
00:13:25,597 --> 00:13:27,015
Did you hang out at the Mug a lot?

215
00:13:27,099 --> 00:13:30,769
Uh, honestly, I spent most of my time
at the library. [laughs]

216
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:35,691
But don't tell Tom. I'm trying to maintain
the illusion I'm not a total nerd.

217
00:13:35,774 --> 00:13:37,776
[friend]
Glad to see that you're doing okay.

218
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:40,863
You were in a bad place there, so…

219
00:13:40,946 --> 00:13:42,197
I was just a little depressed.

220
00:13:43,156 --> 00:13:44,157
Uh…

221
00:13:45,868 --> 00:13:48,328
Okay. It got bad but, you know, it's like,

222
00:13:48,412 --> 00:13:50,956
who hasn't been borderline suicidal
at some point in their life?

223
00:13:51,707 --> 00:13:53,792
It's not funny.
Not supposed to joke about that stuff.

224
00:13:53,876 --> 00:13:57,087
- Come on. Come on.
- [laughs] Okay, you're right.

225
00:13:57,171 --> 00:14:00,132
But, um… [smacks lips] …I'm good now.

226
00:14:00,215 --> 00:14:04,011
You know, like, I'm great, actually.

227
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:10,976
It was pretty great. Um, yeah,
we actually met in the bookstore.

228
00:14:11,059 --> 00:14:12,186
[laughs]

229
00:14:16,064 --> 00:14:17,232
Hi.

230
00:14:22,863 --> 00:14:24,948
How come we always come back to my place?

231
00:14:27,075 --> 00:14:28,076
What do you mean?

232
00:14:30,162 --> 00:14:31,997
I wanna see where you live. [chuckles]

233
00:14:32,581 --> 00:14:36,084
It's, uh...
It's kind of uncomfortable there.

234
00:14:39,171 --> 00:14:42,382
Well, my place
isn't exactly the Four Seasons. [chuckles]

235
00:14:42,466 --> 00:14:44,760
No, it's not that. It's, um,

236
00:14:46,178 --> 00:14:48,805
I live with my dad
and his new wife, and, uh…

237
00:14:50,682 --> 00:14:52,518
My dad and I don't really get along.

238
00:14:54,811 --> 00:14:55,938
Um…

239
00:14:57,814 --> 00:14:59,858
he thinks I'm a disappointment.

240
00:15:01,568 --> 00:15:03,153
"All happy families are alike."

241
00:15:04,530 --> 00:15:05,656
And all that, right?

242
00:15:09,493 --> 00:15:12,371
Anyways, uh, he's really sick, so…

243
00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:16,333
Sorry he's sick.

244
00:15:18,252 --> 00:15:19,253
It's okay.

245
00:15:22,047 --> 00:15:23,757
But you're not a disappointment.

246
00:15:26,552 --> 00:15:27,427
[chuckles]

247
00:15:27,511 --> 00:15:28,762
[door buzzing]

248
00:15:50,576 --> 00:15:51,869
[knocks on door]

249
00:15:52,369 --> 00:15:53,495
Sandra?

250
00:16:02,754 --> 00:16:03,672
Hey.

251
00:16:04,256 --> 00:16:05,174
Are you okay?

252
00:16:05,674 --> 00:16:09,344
You're not, um...
You're not returning my texts.

253
00:16:11,638 --> 00:16:12,639
I'm sorry.

254
00:16:14,683 --> 00:16:17,477
My brother's in trouble.
He owes them money,

255
00:16:17,561 --> 00:16:20,063
so they cracked three of his ribs,
broke his cheekbone.

256
00:16:20,814 --> 00:16:23,233
Said if he didn't pay up,
they'd come back and finish the job.

257
00:16:23,317 --> 00:16:24,401
How much does he owe them?

258
00:16:24,484 --> 00:16:26,069
Paying them back is not an option.

259
00:16:26,153 --> 00:16:28,488
- So, what is an option?
- I give him money, and he runs.

260
00:16:28,572 --> 00:16:32,659
Okay. So, say he runs,
and they can't find him.

261
00:16:32,743 --> 00:16:34,912
Who do you think
they're gonna come looking for to collect?

262
00:16:34,995 --> 00:16:37,623
Me? No, they don't even know I exist.

263
00:16:37,706 --> 00:16:39,708
- Are you sure?
- [sighs] I'm not sure of anything.

264
00:16:42,878 --> 00:16:45,547
- You have to pay them off.
- I told you that's not possible.

265
00:16:45,631 --> 00:16:48,175
- How much do they want?
- $350,000.

266
00:16:49,092 --> 00:16:50,677
And they want it in four days,

267
00:16:50,761 --> 00:16:52,721
so short of robbing a bank,
that's just not gonna happen.

268
00:16:54,348 --> 00:16:55,432
I can give you the money.

269
00:16:58,185 --> 00:16:59,520
- What?
- It's in the bank.

270
00:16:59,603 --> 00:17:00,646
I can just go make a withdrawal.

271
00:17:00,729 --> 00:17:02,940
You wouldn't have to…
[inhales sharply] …rob it.

272
00:17:03,649 --> 00:17:06,108
I-I don't understand.
[stammers] You live at home.

273
00:17:06,193 --> 00:17:09,029
- You... You work in a bookstore.
- No, I own a bookstore.

274
00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:12,324
How do you think I manage to keep it open?
All that place does is lose money.

275
00:17:12,406 --> 00:17:14,867
You're saying you have that money
just sitting in a bank?

276
00:17:15,452 --> 00:17:18,079
Yeah. More. Yeah. My father has money.

277
00:17:20,707 --> 00:17:22,209
Why is this
the first time I'm hearing about this?

278
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:23,961
Why does that matter?
Maybe I didn't want you to know.

279
00:17:24,044 --> 00:17:25,253
Well, honestly, it's kinda fucked up

280
00:17:25,337 --> 00:17:26,922
- that you didn't say anything.
- Are you kidding me?

281
00:17:27,005 --> 00:17:28,841
- I'm telling you that I can help you.
- I can't take your money.

282
00:17:28,924 --> 00:17:31,635
- Why not?
- Because it's $350,000. That's why.

283
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:35,305
I appreciate the offer. I really do.

284
00:17:35,389 --> 00:17:37,474
But let's face it,
we're practically strangers.

285
00:17:42,896 --> 00:17:45,774
First of all, it's not my money,
it's my father's money.

286
00:17:45,858 --> 00:17:48,402
And it's not like he earned it
in some noble way.

287
00:17:48,485 --> 00:17:50,237
He has a hedge fund. [chuckles]

288
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:55,409
And second of all,
fuck you for saying we're strangers.

289
00:17:58,704 --> 00:18:00,372
You are the best thing
that's ever happened to me.

290
00:18:05,752 --> 00:18:08,005
[Sandra] <i>I'm going to pay you back,
no matter how long it takes.</i>

291
00:18:08,088 --> 00:18:10,382
[Tom] <i>That's okay. I wish
you'd let me come with you though.</i>

292
00:18:10,465 --> 00:18:12,843
[Sandra] <i>I told you I don't want you
anywhere near these people.</i>

293
00:18:12,926 --> 00:18:14,136
- It's all there.
- Got it.

294
00:18:14,803 --> 00:18:17,306
<i>I'll be fine. What are you doing tonight?</i>

295
00:18:17,389 --> 00:18:18,390
[chuckles]

296
00:18:18,473 --> 00:18:21,476
I'm... I was hoping to hang out
with this pretty girl that I know.

297
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:25,397
[chuckles] Well, there's this great
little Japanese restaurant on Mott Street.

298
00:18:25,898 --> 00:18:27,608
If you're not doing anything,
dinner's on me.

299
00:18:31,195 --> 00:18:32,196
Hey.

300
00:18:39,494 --> 00:18:40,370
[Tom] I love you.

301
00:18:41,121 --> 00:18:42,748
I'm so sorry about all this.

302
00:18:51,798 --> 00:18:54,009
[inhales deeply] All right.

303
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:06,522
[breathes deeply]

304
00:19:37,261 --> 00:19:38,178

305
00:19:38,262 --> 00:19:40,222
Sandra? [breathing heavily]

306
00:19:41,723 --> 00:19:43,392
Sandra, are you okay?

307
00:19:45,978 --> 00:19:49,231
Sandra! Sandra!

308
00:19:54,528 --> 00:19:55,529
Sandra!

309
00:19:58,949 --> 00:19:59,950
Sandra!

["Just A Lonely Christmas" playing]

311
00:20:41,491 --> 00:20:43,493
Shit. [breathing shakily]

312
00:20:57,424 --> 00:21:00,427
How's Christmas Day? It's not that bad.
[indistinct]

313
00:21:02,221 --> 00:21:03,472
Hey, you Larusso?

314
00:21:05,974 --> 00:21:07,017
[Larusso] Over here.

315
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:13,398
- You're pretty late, Sandy.
- I'm sorry.

316
00:21:13,482 --> 00:21:15,567
There's no cabs.
It's fucking Christmas Eve.

317
00:21:16,652 --> 00:21:17,736
Where's Carl?

318
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:20,781
Mr. Knutson's wife is sick.
I'll be taking over for him.

319
00:21:20,864 --> 00:21:22,324
Carl usually...

320
00:21:22,991 --> 00:21:25,953
Mr. Knutson usually has us meet
in his office.

321
00:21:26,036 --> 00:21:28,372
Yeah, I thought we'd meet somewhere
a little less formal given the holiday.

322
00:21:29,122 --> 00:21:30,791
But if you'd rather go to my office,
we can do that.

323
00:21:30,874 --> 00:21:32,000
No, it's fine.

324
00:21:32,084 --> 00:21:33,085
Great. Have a seat.

325
00:21:37,923 --> 00:21:39,842
- So, where were you tonight?
- Nowhere.

326
00:21:41,426 --> 00:21:44,054
[scoffs] Just with a friend.
Girl I work with.

327
00:21:44,137 --> 00:21:45,806
- A girl you work with at Starbucks?
- Yeah.

328
00:21:45,889 --> 00:21:48,559
Caroline.
I can give you her number if you want.

329
00:21:48,642 --> 00:21:49,810
That won't be necessary.

330
00:21:49,893 --> 00:21:51,520
- Did you do any drugs tonight, Sandy?
- No.

331
00:21:51,603 --> 00:21:53,981
Did you engage in any behavior
that would violate your parole?

332
00:21:54,064 --> 00:21:55,482
Nope. No.

333
00:21:56,066 --> 00:21:57,943
How is that job? You doing good?

334
00:21:58,026 --> 00:21:59,945
Yeah. It's fine.

335
00:22:00,028 --> 00:22:03,657
Yeah. Starbucks is great.
There's lots of opportunity there.

336
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:05,659
[chuckles] Yeah, I love it.

337
00:22:06,577 --> 00:22:07,870
Yeah.

338
00:22:07,953 --> 00:22:08,829
The thing is, Sandy,

339
00:22:08,912 --> 00:22:11,373
I went to your job and they told me
you haven't been there in a month.

340
00:22:14,334 --> 00:22:17,045
Uh, yeah. I ca... I can explain. Um…

341
00:22:18,297 --> 00:22:20,591
- I got into a fight with the manager…
- Yeah.

342
00:22:20,674 --> 00:22:23,218
…'cause he's a real...
He's a real fucking perv, okay?

343
00:22:23,302 --> 00:22:24,803
And I've been looking
for another job, so...

344
00:22:24,887 --> 00:22:26,430
Having a job is
a part of your parole agreement.

345
00:22:26,513 --> 00:22:27,806
- Do you understand?
- Uh-huh, yeah.

346
00:22:27,890 --> 00:22:29,224
So, you getting fired is strike one.

347
00:22:29,308 --> 00:22:30,851
So, let me ask you a question.

348
00:22:30,934 --> 00:22:32,895
If I give you a drug test right now,
how would that go?

349
00:22:33,478 --> 00:22:35,689
- Negative.
- Negative? Are you sure?

350
00:22:36,356 --> 00:22:38,942
Because if I gotta go to my car
and take the trouble to get a test,

351
00:22:39,026 --> 00:22:41,904
and it comes back positive,
I'm gonna be very goddamn upset.

352
00:22:42,654 --> 00:22:44,198
So, tell me how would that go?

353
00:22:47,367 --> 00:22:50,287
- I smoked some weed the other night.
- That is strike two.

354
00:22:50,370 --> 00:22:51,914
I can bring you in right now.

355
00:22:51,997 --> 00:22:53,040
Your list of priors,

356
00:22:53,123 --> 00:22:55,292
- you aren't going anywhere anytime soon.
- I know, I know, I know.

357
00:22:55,375 --> 00:22:56,793
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- [Larusso] You're sorry?

358
00:22:56,877 --> 00:22:59,087
Give me one reason not to bring you in.

359
00:23:01,798 --> 00:23:03,592
[Sandra inhales sharply]

360
00:23:04,343 --> 00:23:05,469
I'll give you money.

361
00:23:05,552 --> 00:23:08,263
And that is attempted bribery.
Strike three.

362
00:23:08,347 --> 00:23:10,724
Congratulations, Sandy,
that's the whole fucking ball game.

363
00:23:10,807 --> 00:23:13,018
- So stand up and turn around now.
- I... Okay. No, no. Come on.

364
00:23:13,101 --> 00:23:14,978
- Look, I can give you a lot of money.
- What is a lot of money?

365
00:23:15,062 --> 00:23:17,064
Whatever you wanted.
Look, I know where to get it,

366
00:23:17,147 --> 00:23:18,649
and you know I ain't lying to you,
Miss Larusso,

367
00:23:18,732 --> 00:23:20,859
- because you're my parole officer and...
- What are you doing?

368
00:23:20,943 --> 00:23:21,777
[chiming]

369
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:23,987
[laughs] What do you mean?
Nothing. What the fuck?

370
00:23:24,071 --> 00:23:26,198
- Are you recording me?
- No! No, stop. Look...

371
00:23:26,281 --> 00:23:27,324
Are you trying to entrap me?

372
00:23:27,407 --> 00:23:29,284
- No, it ain't like that.
- What the fuck are you thinking?

373
00:23:29,368 --> 00:23:30,702
- No, no, no. Look...
- Do you think I'm an asshole?

374
00:23:30,786 --> 00:23:32,162
I do. I think you're an asshole.

375
00:23:32,663 --> 00:23:34,915
Sir, I'm a parole officer
and this young lady is my parolee…

376
00:23:34,998 --> 00:23:36,250
- Yeah.
- …and none of this is your concern.

377
00:23:36,333 --> 00:23:37,334
You're shaking her down.

378
00:23:37,417 --> 00:23:39,169
I've watched you do it
to parolees all night.

379
00:23:41,421 --> 00:23:42,422
What do you want?

380
00:23:47,469 --> 00:23:49,054
How about I pay you to walk away?

381
00:23:49,638 --> 00:23:50,639
How much?

382
00:23:51,181 --> 00:23:52,307
How much do I have?

383
00:23:53,225 --> 00:23:54,226
[inhales deeply]

384
00:23:54,935 --> 00:23:55,811
Um…

385
00:23:56,311 --> 00:23:58,355
[inhales deeply] Let's see.

386
00:23:58,438 --> 00:24:01,024
Um, that's twen...

387
00:24:01,108 --> 00:24:04,152
45, 46, 47.

388
00:24:04,236 --> 00:24:09,157
That's ten, 20, 40, 60, 80, 100.

389
00:24:10,117 --> 00:24:11,118
Oh, shit.

390
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:14,663
Two hundred. Three hundred, 400.

391
00:24:14,746 --> 00:24:19,126
- That's $447.
- Mmm.

392
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:24,381
You're looking at this?

393
00:24:27,759 --> 00:24:28,760
Okay.

394
00:24:33,307 --> 00:24:35,976
- That's a Rolex Submariner.
- Yeah, I know what a Rolex is.

395
00:24:36,685 --> 00:24:38,187
You must be drunk.

396
00:24:42,107 --> 00:24:44,818
[laughing] Yeah, maybe I am.

397
00:24:48,363 --> 00:24:49,448
I'm sorry.

398
00:24:51,992 --> 00:24:52,993
Sorry.

399
00:24:57,247 --> 00:24:58,248
Have a good night.

400
00:25:03,170 --> 00:25:04,463
[door opens]

401
00:25:04,546 --> 00:25:05,547
Don't you fucking move.

402
00:25:13,388 --> 00:25:14,389
Wait up.

403
00:25:17,476 --> 00:25:18,393
Let's talk.

404
00:25:19,269 --> 00:25:22,648
I've got a wife and I got two kids,
and I'm just trying to provide.

405
00:25:23,232 --> 00:25:25,817
And this one has it coming
because she is a fuckup.

406
00:25:25,901 --> 00:25:28,737
- Eat shit.
- Keep it up, Sandy. Keep it up.

407
00:25:29,905 --> 00:25:31,615
How much is this gonna cost?

408
00:25:31,698 --> 00:25:33,116
- Five grand.
- Good night.

409
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,409
No, no, no. No, no, no.

410
00:25:35,536 --> 00:25:37,871
I just saw your car
and you are walking around here,

411
00:25:37,955 --> 00:25:41,708
sporting an $8,500 watch,
that you were just gonna give me.

412
00:25:42,209 --> 00:25:44,086
[patron] I only have $447.

413
00:25:44,169 --> 00:25:46,713
- [Larusso] I'll take the watch.
- That's 8,500. Like you said.

414
00:25:46,797 --> 00:25:49,758
Hmm. Eighty-five hundred, new? Correct?

415
00:25:49,842 --> 00:25:52,177
What is it used? Maybe seven?

416
00:25:53,178 --> 00:25:54,429
[patron] Maybe.

417
00:25:54,513 --> 00:25:56,515
[Larusso] So, give me the watch
and I'll give you the change.

418
00:25:56,598 --> 00:25:59,434
[inhales deeply, sighs]

419
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:07,901
[Larusso] Thanks.

420
00:26:16,118 --> 00:26:18,120
[sighs] Happy holidays, motherfucker.

421
00:26:24,001 --> 00:26:25,002
[door closes]

422
00:26:30,257 --> 00:26:32,718
- [train chugging]
- [car alarm beeps]

423
00:26:48,817 --> 00:26:49,818
It wasn't real?

424
00:26:51,695 --> 00:26:52,696
Get in.

425
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:57,326
I gotta give you your cut.

426
00:26:59,036 --> 00:27:00,412
- My cut?
- Your money.

427
00:27:11,590 --> 00:27:12,591
Thousand dollars.

428
00:27:14,218 --> 00:27:15,219
Got a knife on me.

429
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:17,721
[patron] Great.

430
00:27:20,182 --> 00:27:21,558
Come on, it's freezing out.

431
00:28:17,865 --> 00:28:19,449
[door opens]

432
00:28:43,098 --> 00:28:44,808
[sighs] Have a seat.

433
00:29:00,282 --> 00:29:01,992
You can take your jacket off.

434
00:29:06,705 --> 00:29:07,873
Don't try any shit.

435
00:29:14,254 --> 00:29:16,715
- [patron] Now take off your shoes.
- Fuck you.

436
00:29:27,059 --> 00:29:28,060
I need to trust you.

437
00:29:44,952 --> 00:29:46,119
I'm not a junkie.

438
00:29:54,419 --> 00:29:55,504
Roll up your sleeves.

439
00:29:56,588 --> 00:29:57,589
[scoffs]

440
00:30:10,352 --> 00:30:12,771
You can sleep there. Or you can leave.

441
00:30:17,109 --> 00:30:18,443
And what happens if I stay?

442
00:30:20,237 --> 00:30:21,321
You work for me.

443
00:30:32,499 --> 00:30:33,625
[door closes]

444
00:30:43,010 --> 00:30:45,137
- [door opens]
- [breathing shakily]

445
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:46,305
[siren wailing in distance]

446
00:30:46,388 --> 00:30:49,308
- [patron] Morning.
- [footsteps approaching]

447
00:30:53,437 --> 00:30:54,688
What's your favorite movie?

448
00:30:55,522 --> 00:30:56,565
What's my favorite movie?

449
00:30:57,858 --> 00:30:59,651
- Yeah, what's your favorite movie?
- [chuckles]

450
00:31:01,069 --> 00:31:02,112
<i>Titanic.</i>

451
00:31:02,196 --> 00:31:03,405
[patron chuckles]

452
00:31:03,906 --> 00:31:05,073
That's a classic.

453
00:31:05,949 --> 00:31:07,701
- You like that movie?
- Of course.

454
00:31:08,368 --> 00:31:10,829
[chuckles] DiCaprio was so young in it.

455
00:31:11,705 --> 00:31:13,165
Honestly, he's never been better.

456
00:31:13,248 --> 00:31:14,541
I liked him in <i>The Departed.</i>

457
00:31:16,418 --> 00:31:20,756
He's okay, but <i>Titanic,</i>
that's the movie that made him.

458
00:31:21,632 --> 00:31:23,467
And Kate Winslet was so beautiful.

459
00:31:25,552 --> 00:31:28,847
And the end.
I'll still never get over that. [sighs]

460
00:31:29,431 --> 00:31:30,474
[grunts]

461
00:31:30,557 --> 00:31:31,725
Can't believe you like <i>Titanic.</i>

462
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:35,020
I don't. I've never seen it.

463
00:31:36,730 --> 00:31:38,190
- You've never seen <i>Titanic</i>?
- No.

464
00:31:38,690 --> 00:31:40,901
I don't watch movies.
They're a waste of time.

465
00:31:41,485 --> 00:31:45,197
But I gave you the impression that I did,
and that's what we're gonna do with you.

466
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:48,116
We're gonna give people the impression
that you're somebody that you're not.

467
00:31:49,493 --> 00:31:52,162
And when I'm done with you,
it's gonna be 100% convincing.

468
00:31:54,957 --> 00:31:57,084
We're gonna teach you
a little about everything.

469
00:31:59,127 --> 00:32:00,963
So that you can lie about anything.

470
00:32:02,297 --> 00:32:03,632
Read those cover to cover.

471
00:32:03,715 --> 00:32:05,092
You fucking kidding me?

472
00:32:06,343 --> 00:32:08,178
What did you do
with that $1,000 that I gave you?

473
00:32:08,262 --> 00:32:11,223
In my jacket. Why?

474
00:32:12,808 --> 00:32:14,685
From now on, each time you curse,
I get a hundred.

475
00:32:14,768 --> 00:32:16,228
Fuck that! That's my money.

476
00:32:16,311 --> 00:32:18,814
Now I get 200. You still got 800 left.

477
00:32:20,190 --> 00:32:21,191
Read those.

478
00:32:21,775 --> 00:32:22,734
What's your name?

479
00:32:22,818 --> 00:32:24,152
It's Max.

480
00:32:24,236 --> 00:32:25,237
Merry Christmas, Max.

481
00:32:27,030 --> 00:32:28,365
Merry Christmas, Sandra.

482
00:32:28,448 --> 00:32:29,658
Sandy.

483
00:32:30,701 --> 00:32:32,160
Everybody calls me Sandy.

484
00:32:33,161 --> 00:32:34,162
Not anymore.

485
00:32:36,123 --> 00:32:37,165
[door closes]

486
00:32:45,299 --> 00:32:47,342

00:33:51,823 --> 00:33:53,242
[banging on door] Max!

490
00:33:54,493 --> 00:33:57,371
Let me in. I promise
I won't do it anymore. Please!

491
00:33:57,454 --> 00:33:59,581
[breathing shakily]

492
00:33:59,665 --> 00:34:00,999

00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,001
Max!

494
00:34:04,127 --> 00:34:06,755
Please, please, please! [sobs]

495
00:34:06,839 --> 00:34:08,799
[breathing shakily]

496
00:34:14,513 --> 00:34:15,556

[breathing shakily]

499
00:34:36,577 --> 00:34:39,329
I need you clean. You understand?

500
00:34:42,416 --> 00:34:44,001
I gotta trust you.

501
00:34:47,087 --> 00:34:48,589

[Max] <i>Anna Karenina.</i>

[Sandra] <i>"All happy families are alike,</i>

505

is unhappy in its own..."

507

"But each unhappy family
is unhappy in its own way."

508

00:47:45,449 --> 00:47:48,452
- Yeah, I was.
- Yeah. I had some fun times there myself.

675
00:47:49,077 --> 00:47:51,121
- Uh, back in the '70s.
- [laughs]

676
00:47:52,789 --> 00:47:54,374
- You're old.
- [mother] Max.

677
00:47:54,458 --> 00:47:57,586
That's, um... I'm...
Come... Come with me, I wanna talk.

678
00:47:57,669 --> 00:47:59,213
- Come on. Come on with me. Yeah.
- Really?

679
00:47:59,296 --> 00:48:00,297
I'm so sorry.

680
00:48:00,380 --> 00:48:01,590
Come. Come on.

681
00:48:02,424 --> 00:48:03,467
Let's go.

682
00:48:04,051 --> 00:48:06,553
Excuse me, sir.

683
00:48:06,637 --> 00:48:08,555
- Hi.
- No, stop that. Come on.

684
00:48:08,639 --> 00:48:11,183
- You look great.
- Hey. What is the matter with you?

685
00:48:11,266 --> 00:48:12,601
- What?
- You are so rude.

686
00:48:14,102 --> 00:48:17,231
- [Max] What do you know about this guy?
- Honey, he's a public figure.

687
00:48:17,314 --> 00:48:20,234
Anything you wanna know,
you can just Google him.

688
00:48:20,317 --> 00:48:22,945
[scoffs]
You can't be alone for two minutes.

689
00:48:23,028 --> 00:48:24,738
You throw yourself
into these relationships.

690
00:48:24,821 --> 00:48:26,865
This is different.
[stutters] It really is.

691
00:48:28,242 --> 00:48:29,201
Sure it is.

692
00:48:29,952 --> 00:48:31,995
Go easy on that, please.
I think you've had enough.

693
00:48:33,830 --> 00:48:35,207
Stop being my mom, Mom.

694
00:48:35,290 --> 00:48:38,377
Wh... Sweetheart, what is it?

695
00:48:39,211 --> 00:48:40,337
What's going on?

696
00:48:40,921 --> 00:48:43,215
I thought you were gonna bring
your girlfriend tonight.

697
00:48:43,298 --> 00:48:44,341
Where is she?

698
00:48:44,925 --> 00:48:46,051
Seeing somebody else.

699
00:48:46,552 --> 00:48:47,594
I see.

700
00:48:49,096 --> 00:48:50,097
I'm sorry.

701
00:48:51,515 --> 00:48:54,268
I never liked her.
I think she was a bad influence.

702
00:48:55,978 --> 00:48:57,938
Can I stay here for a little while?
[sighs]

703
00:48:58,856 --> 00:48:59,940
Okay. Um...

704
00:49:01,275 --> 00:49:04,945
Uh… [sighs] …Are you using?

705
00:49:05,028 --> 00:49:06,071
[jazz band continues]

706
00:49:06,154 --> 00:49:10,576
No, I'm not using drugs.
I haven't done drugs in a year.

707
00:49:10,659 --> 00:49:12,828
It's just that I-I can't
go through that again,

708
00:49:12,911 --> 00:49:15,455
- and that can't happen here.
- Mom, I'm clean.

709
00:49:15,539 --> 00:49:16,832
My God. What the fuck is...

710
00:49:16,915 --> 00:49:19,251
What do you want?
You want me to prove it to you?

711
00:49:19,334 --> 00:49:20,377
A fucking piss test?

712
00:49:20,460 --> 00:49:23,005
- Is that what you want? Huh?
- Stop. What? What are you doing?

713
00:49:23,088 --> 00:49:26,133
- Here. I'll do it right now! Okay?
- No! No, don't. Stop! Stop!

714
00:49:26,216 --> 00:49:28,635
- You can see for yourself!
- Don't do that. Stop it right now!

715
00:49:30,012 --> 00:49:33,307
[Max urinating]

716
00:49:33,390 --> 00:49:34,433
Prove it to you.

717
00:49:35,392 --> 00:49:38,896
[singing continues in distance]

718
00:49:38,979 --> 00:49:40,939
- [breathes heavily]
- Go ahead.

719
00:49:42,357 --> 00:49:44,985
- Test it.
- Please don't do this to me.

720
00:49:45,068 --> 00:49:46,069
Test it!

721
00:49:47,321 --> 00:49:51,325
Please. Please. Please.
Please, don't do this to me.

722
00:49:56,246 --> 00:49:57,247
[sighs]

723
00:50:00,459 --> 00:50:03,962
- [sobbing]
- Mom, I'm sorry.

724
00:50:09,092 --> 00:50:10,469
- [sighs] I'm sorry, Mom.
- [cries]

725
00:50:10,552 --> 00:50:14,765
Why do you do this?
Why do you do this to me? [sobbing]

726
00:50:15,474 --> 00:50:17,267
[sighs] I'm really sorry.

727
00:50:19,853 --> 00:50:23,941
Just... I still need a place to stay, okay?

728
00:50:26,735 --> 00:50:27,778
Please?

729
00:50:27,861 --> 00:50:30,364
You can stay.
Just not for very long, okay?

730
00:50:33,784 --> 00:50:36,161
Thank you. I love you.

731
00:50:37,496 --> 00:50:39,665
- [cries, exhales deeply]
- [kisses] Thank you.

732
00:50:40,457 --> 00:50:42,376
[sniffs, exhales deeply]

733
00:50:50,509 --> 00:50:51,593
You enjoy the show?

734
00:51:07,067 --> 00:51:09,486
I'm so... I'm so sorry. [sobbing]

735
00:51:09,570 --> 00:51:12,781
I'm... I'm so... I'm so sorry. I'm sorry.

736
00:51:12,865 --> 00:51:16,451
[sobbing]

737
00:51:29,548 --> 00:51:32,134
[mother] He spent the last year
putting together a company

738
00:51:32,217 --> 00:51:34,803
to charter boats in the Bahamas,

739
00:51:34,887 --> 00:51:39,266
but then the hurricane wiped that out,
which is too bad because he was so happy.

740
00:51:39,349 --> 00:51:42,186
- He was doing so well...
- [Richard] Madeline. Uh, how does he live?

741
00:51:42,269 --> 00:51:45,439
Well, his father left him some money,
and, um... Mmm…

742
00:51:46,690 --> 00:51:48,192
I help him out from time to time.

743
00:51:49,860 --> 00:51:50,861
Of course you do.

744
00:51:51,737 --> 00:51:54,406
I was so young when he was born, you know?

745
00:51:54,489 --> 00:51:58,160
And then his father died,
and I'm suddenly a widow,

746
00:51:58,243 --> 00:52:01,371
and I didn't always know
how to be a mother.

747
00:52:01,455 --> 00:52:04,041
[Richard] It's up to him to do better.
He-He's an adult.

748
00:52:04,124 --> 00:52:05,959
[Madeline]
No, he isn't. And that's my fault.

749
00:52:07,044 --> 00:52:10,297
He's always been my little Max.
And he can't swim without me. [chuckles]

750
00:52:11,131 --> 00:52:12,132
Morning, Mom.

751
00:52:13,550 --> 00:52:16,637
Hi, sweetheart. How'd you sleep?

752
00:52:17,721 --> 00:52:20,974
Great. Room's got an amazing view.

753
00:52:22,643 --> 00:52:23,644
Good.

754
00:52:23,727 --> 00:52:28,148
Um... Well, I, um...
I actually have an appointment downtown,

755
00:52:28,232 --> 00:52:31,902
but I was thinking, um, if you were free
that maybe we could have lunch together.

756
00:52:32,486 --> 00:52:34,988
Um, at one o'clock. Via Carota?

757
00:52:35,656 --> 00:52:37,783
- Sounds great.
- Okay. Perfect.

758
00:52:40,035 --> 00:52:42,246
- See you later. [kisses]
- [kisses]

759
00:52:47,960 --> 00:52:48,961
Bye, honey.

760
00:53:01,640 --> 00:53:02,558
Richard?

761
00:53:06,562 --> 00:53:08,146
I'm sorry about yesterday.

762
00:53:08,230 --> 00:53:12,693
I took a Klonopin,
and I had a lot of drinks.

763
00:53:12,776 --> 00:53:16,989
[inhales sharply] Max, we're gonna be
in each other's lives

764
00:53:17,072 --> 00:53:18,657
for the foreseeable future.

765
00:53:19,366 --> 00:53:21,201
Let's make the best of it, shall we?

766
00:53:22,536 --> 00:53:25,539
You know,
your mother and I are attending, uh,

767
00:53:25,622 --> 00:53:29,459
a benefit tonight
for the Richard Hobbes Foundation.

768
00:53:29,543 --> 00:53:31,879
[stutters] My late wife founded it.

769
00:53:31,962 --> 00:53:35,507
We make all sorts
of charitable contributions.

770
00:53:36,592 --> 00:53:38,844
Uh, did you want me to make a donation?

771
00:53:38,927 --> 00:53:40,804
Because, honestly,
I'm a little light right now.

772
00:53:40,888 --> 00:53:44,141
[chuckles]
No. No, I figured you might wanna join us.

773
00:53:44,933 --> 00:53:48,979
There's a gonna be a...
A few very hip musical acts.

774
00:53:49,062 --> 00:53:51,231
They tell me they're quite relevant.

775
00:53:54,443 --> 00:53:56,320
<i>There's gonna be
a lot of young people your age.</i>

776
00:53:57,946 --> 00:53:58,947
<i>Lot of young women.</i>

777
00:54:00,949 --> 00:54:04,912
Thank you, but I think
I should just stay in and rest.

778
00:54:07,372 --> 00:54:09,875
Yeah. Fair enough.

779
00:54:14,087 --> 00:54:18,175
[crunching, chewing]

780
00:54:32,814 --> 00:54:35,943
Well, you were terrible.
You treated him like a waiter. [laughs]

781
00:54:36,026 --> 00:54:38,946
I still have no idea who he is.

782
00:54:39,029 --> 00:54:43,408
No, he's... he's on that TV show.
He plays a spy. He's very famous.

783
00:54:43,992 --> 00:54:46,787
All night, all I could think about
was being alone with you.

784
00:54:46,870 --> 00:54:48,038
You're alone with me now.

785
00:54:54,169 --> 00:54:57,798
I don't care about actors.
You should know that.

786
00:54:59,550 --> 00:55:02,261
[breathes heavily]
I just want you all to myself.

787
00:55:05,973 --> 00:55:06,974
[elevator dings]

788
00:55:08,141 --> 00:55:09,560
- [officer] Sir, calm down.
- [Max] I asked you to identify…

789
00:55:09,643 --> 00:55:11,937
- Sir, the police are here.
- [shouting indistinctly]

790
00:55:12,020 --> 00:55:15,440
- Police? Hey! What's going on here?
- Fuck does that even fucking mean?

791
00:55:15,524 --> 00:55:17,651
- Sir, excuse me. I'm, uh, NYPD.
- [sighs] Oh, my G...

792
00:55:17,734 --> 00:55:19,528
Detective Collins.
Does this young man live here?

793
00:55:19,611 --> 00:55:21,572
- Well, he's staying here.
- I don't fucking live here.

794
00:55:21,655 --> 00:55:24,491
- What did you do?
- Nothing. I didn't do anything.

795
00:55:24,575 --> 00:55:25,993
He solicited drugs
from an undercover officer.

796
00:55:26,076 --> 00:55:28,203
You came up to me
and tried to sell me fucking cocaine.

797
00:55:28,287 --> 00:55:29,913
- And you said yes.
- Don't put words in my mouth.

798
00:55:29,997 --> 00:55:32,082
- Detective, how bad is this?
- It's not looking good.

799
00:55:32,165 --> 00:55:33,876
[stutters] He has a few offenses.

800
00:55:33,959 --> 00:55:36,295
We ran his name,
and he's looking at doing some time.

801
00:55:36,378 --> 00:55:37,963
- Oh, my God. Max.
- Wha... What happens now?

802
00:55:38,046 --> 00:55:40,549
- I'll take him downtown...
- Fuck that, dude. I'm outta here.

803
00:55:40,632 --> 00:55:41,884
Get your fucking hands off of me!

804
00:55:41,967 --> 00:55:44,678
Richard!
Richard, please. Stop him. Stop him!

805
00:55:44,761 --> 00:55:45,846
Calm down!

806
00:55:45,929 --> 00:55:48,682
- Fuck!
- Detective, can we talk about this?

807
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:51,810
- [Max sighs] Fuck.
- Now?

808
00:55:52,519 --> 00:55:54,062
- [grunts]
- [Madeline stammers]

809
00:55:58,025 --> 00:56:01,028
I make large donations
to the NYPD every year.

810
00:56:01,111 --> 00:56:02,404
Yes, sir, I'm aware of that.

811
00:56:02,487 --> 00:56:04,740
That's the reason for the courtesy call.
It's why I'm here.

812
00:56:04,823 --> 00:56:06,867
I know the commissioner.
Marty is a good friend.

813
00:56:06,950 --> 00:56:10,037
- I can put in a good word for you.
- Richard, you don't have to do that.

814
00:56:10,120 --> 00:56:12,247
[Richard]
My word carries weight in this city.

815
00:56:15,250 --> 00:56:16,668
That can cut both ways.

816
00:56:16,752 --> 00:56:19,755
I really appreciate what you've done,
coming here.

817
00:56:19,838 --> 00:56:20,881
Uh, I don't know, sir.

818
00:56:20,964 --> 00:56:22,382
[Richard] I'm gonna pay you for your time.

819
00:56:23,383 --> 00:56:25,802
I c... I can't do that.
No, I'm... I'm sorry.

820
00:56:26,345 --> 00:56:28,180
Take the fucking money, Detective.

821
00:56:29,014 --> 00:56:31,600
[breathes deeply]

822
00:56:33,644 --> 00:56:36,063
- Stop. He's not a cop.
- What?

823
00:56:36,146 --> 00:56:37,523
- Ma'am, ex...
- Shut up.

824
00:56:39,566 --> 00:56:41,777
This is... This is what Max does.

825
00:56:41,860 --> 00:56:44,404
He plays these… [inhales deeply]
…these little confidence games.

826
00:56:45,697 --> 00:56:49,201
That's what this is, isn't it? This is...
This is one of your games, right?

827
00:56:50,160 --> 00:56:51,912
- I can assure you that I'm...
- You get out.

828
00:56:51,995 --> 00:56:55,123
Get out or I really will call the police.
I mean it. Get out of here.

829
00:57:01,004 --> 00:57:04,258
[chuckles] Tipsy, I mean, I think...

830
00:57:04,341 --> 00:57:05,926
- Dude, fuck.
- You better... You better go.

831
00:57:06,009 --> 00:57:07,928
- Do you think this is funny?
- Why'd you fucking break?

832
00:57:08,011 --> 00:57:09,346
Do you think this is funny?

833
00:57:09,429 --> 00:57:10,639
Come on, man.

834
00:57:11,431 --> 00:57:13,267
- You okay?
- Get out of here. Get out of here.

835
00:57:13,350 --> 00:57:15,102
- Oh, okay.
- Sorry. I'm sorry.

836
00:57:15,185 --> 00:57:17,104
- I'll call you later. Thank you.
- All right, dude.

837
00:57:17,855 --> 00:57:19,940
- [chuckles] Hope I catch you later, bro.

[Madeline] Oh, my God.

[Max] Mom, listen.

840
00:57:24,611 --> 00:57:25,904
I gave you everything, you know.

841
00:57:25,988 --> 00:57:28,448
You... You had every advantage.

842
00:57:28,949 --> 00:57:31,118
You... You didn't...
You didn't want for anything,

843
00:57:31,201 --> 00:57:32,786
and this is what you do to me?

844
00:57:33,370 --> 00:57:35,581
- You humiliate me in front of him?
- It's just a little...

845
00:57:43,714 --> 00:57:44,798
I want you to leave.

846
00:57:48,802 --> 00:57:50,345
I don't want you here anymore.

847
00:58:01,899 --> 00:58:07,321
[Richard] All that work for $1,000.

848
00:58:07,946 --> 00:58:10,032
Let me give you a piece of advice, Max.

849
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:14,244
If you're gonna steal, steal a lot.

I'm sorry I hit you.

[Max sighs] Forget it.

856
00:58:48,654 --> 00:58:50,739
No, I took it too far.

857

Let me see.

858
00:59:09,758 --> 00:59:11,260
Is it too early for a drink?

859
00:59:21,478 --> 00:59:23,188
[Max]
I don't like the way you look at him.

860
00:59:23,272 --> 00:59:24,314
[Madeline] Oh, come on.

861
00:59:28,026 --> 00:59:29,069
You like him a little bit.

862
00:59:29,653 --> 00:59:31,697
Of course I like him. He's a billionaire.

863
00:59:33,073 --> 00:59:34,783
That's not what I'm talking about.

864

Hey. Are you okay?

888
01:01:48,083 --> 01:01:51,211
Oh, yeah, it's just maintenance.
Here, follow me.

889
01:01:51,712 --> 01:01:54,631
I wanted to apologize about last night.

890
01:01:54,715 --> 01:01:55,966
It was inappropriate.

891
01:01:56,049 --> 01:01:58,719
[chuckles]
That's a hell of an understatement.

892
01:01:59,928 --> 01:02:02,639
You know,
when your mother first told me about you,

893
01:02:03,182 --> 01:02:07,311
she said that you were well-educated,
smart, clever.

894
01:02:07,895 --> 01:02:12,482
I thought, you know, I'm always
on the lookout for a young man like that.

895
01:02:12,566 --> 01:02:15,360
- [Max] Are you offering me a job here?
- No. I doubt if you'd want one.

01:02:19,740 --> 01:02:21,366
Did you schedule a meeting?

No. I didn't know that I needed one.

Yeah, I can see that. So, what is it?

Just wanted to say hi,
see how you're feeling…

903
01:02:31,960 --> 01:02:34,755
- [Richard] Now is not a good time.
- All right, cool. See you around, Dad.

01:02:36,590 --> 01:02:37,591
Tom.

Come on, in here.

That was my son.

907
01:02:46,517 --> 01:02:49,311
I always assumed
he would inherit all this.

908
01:02:50,521 --> 01:02:53,315
Then his mother died
and he didn't take it well.

909
01:02:53,941 --> 01:02:56,735
He doesn't have the fortitude
to work here. He's weak.

910
01:02:57,945 --> 01:02:59,238
- [Max] Hmm.
- [Richard sighs]

911
01:02:59,321 --> 01:03:04,785
When he turned 21,
I offered him anything he wanted.

01:03:05,911 --> 01:03:08,497

No. But I'm gonna give it to him anyway.

You know why, Max?

919
01:03:30,644 --> 01:03:32,271
Because we only get one life.

920
01:03:32,354 --> 01:03:37,025
And I will not be my son's jailer
for his brief time on earth.

921
01:03:43,282 --> 01:03:45,659
I want you to be honest with yourself,
Max.

If I were to hire you to work for me,
how do you think it would end?

I agree.

Still, I want to offer you a job.
I'm thinking $60,000 a month.

926
01:04:03,677 --> 01:04:06,221
Sixty grand a month? For what?

927
01:04:06,722 --> 01:04:11,185
To go out and find opportunity.
Make a mark for yourself.

928
01:04:12,019 --> 01:04:13,228
You want me gone.

01:04:14,396 --> 01:04:19,568
You cause your mother anguish, Max.
And I will not have it.

930
01:04:21,361 --> 01:04:23,280
So, what am I then? A bad investment?

931
01:04:23,363 --> 01:04:25,365
I didn't get where I am
making bad investments.

932
01:04:25,449 --> 01:04:29,244

Sixty thousand dollars a month?

935
01:04:37,044 --> 01:04:39,838
That can be arranged.
I'll just transfer the money in...

936
01:04:39,922 --> 01:04:42,633
[chuckles] Transfer the money?
No. What? So I can pay taxes?

938
01:04:45,135 --> 01:04:46,678

01:10:19,094 --> 01:10:20,095
Hey.

1007
01:10:20,179 --> 01:10:23,974
[Madeline] <i>Hey. So…</i>

1008
01:10:24,057 --> 01:10:26,768
I have some good news and some bad news.

1009
01:10:27,352 --> 01:10:30,480
<i>The good news is the money is all yours.</i>

1010
01:10:31,523 --> 01:10:33,275
Okay. What's the bad news?

1011
01:10:38,071 --> 01:10:41,992
Uh, the bad news is you were right.

1012
01:10:42,784 --> 01:10:43,785
[Max] <i>Right about what?</i>

1013
01:10:47,372 --> 01:10:48,749
The old man loves me.

1014
01:10:49,291 --> 01:10:53,086
- [laughs]
- <i>He wants to marry me, so I'm staying.</i>

1015
01:10:53,170 --> 01:10:54,421
What are you talking about?

1016
01:10:55,756 --> 01:10:58,425
[Madeline] <i>Maybe I don't wanna
sit around in a bar all day</i>

1017
01:10:58,509 --> 01:11:00,427
pulling short cons
for the rest of my life.

1018
01:11:00,969 --> 01:11:02,346
[Max] <i>You can't be serious.</i>

1019
01:11:02,930 --> 01:11:05,140
Sooner or later the old man
is gonna ask questions.

1020
01:11:05,224 --> 01:11:07,518
[Madeline]
<i>No. No, he won't. He's too invested.</i>

1021
01:11:08,018 --> 01:11:10,562
He's got too much on his mind.

1022
01:11:10,646 --> 01:11:12,356
You know, his health and his business.

1023
01:11:12,439 --> 01:11:14,858
And that... that emotional wreck of a son.

1024
01:11:14,942 --> 01:11:18,904
[chuckles] But I'm the good thing, right?

1025
01:11:18,987 --> 01:11:21,365
- [laughs]
- [Madeline] <i>I'm the good thing he's got.</i>

1026
01:11:21,448 --> 01:11:22,366
Yeah.

1027
01:11:22,449 --> 01:11:24,785
I know you. You stay, you'll slip.

1028
01:11:25,619 --> 01:11:28,956
No, I won't. I'm too good.

1029
01:11:30,749 --> 01:11:34,711
And if they're not looking for you,
they don't see you.

1030
01:11:36,713 --> 01:11:37,965
[Max] <i>Are you really doing this?</i>

1031
01:11:40,467 --> 01:11:44,429
Um… Yeah.

1032
01:11:46,181 --> 01:11:48,016
I don't wanna play the mom anymore.

1033
01:11:50,018 --> 01:11:51,019
It's boring.

1034
01:11:53,564 --> 01:11:54,773
[knocking]

1035
01:11:56,066 --> 01:11:57,818
[officer] Max Burnett, it's the police.

1036
01:11:57,901 --> 01:12:00,821
We have an outstanding warrant
for your arrest. Open the door.

1037
01:12:00,904 --> 01:12:03,115
I don't believe you. Who's at the door?
Tipsy?

1038
01:12:06,326 --> 01:12:07,911
Oh, you better go. [chuckles]

1039
01:12:09,496 --> 01:12:10,789
You're bluffing.

1040
01:12:10,873 --> 01:12:13,625
Yeah, well, then call my bluff
and open the door.

1041
01:12:13,709 --> 01:12:16,170
[knocking]

1042
01:12:16,253 --> 01:12:17,254
[officer] Open the door.

1043
01:12:19,214 --> 01:12:20,299
So, you used me?

1044
01:12:26,096 --> 01:12:27,890
- [knocking]
- [officer] Max Burnett.

1045
01:12:31,310 --> 01:12:32,436
[knocking continues]

1046
01:12:32,519 --> 01:12:33,979
- Fuck.
- [officer] Open the door.

1047
01:12:54,583 --> 01:12:56,585
[breathing deeply]

1048
01:12:56,668 --> 01:12:59,796
["King Arthur:
Act 3 'What Power Art Thou"' playing]

1049
01:13:23,028 --> 01:13:24,696

01:13:32,955 --> 01:13:35,707

1051
01:13:37,417 --> 01:13:39,503

1053
01:13:55,936 --> 01:13:57,020
[attendee whispers] I'm so sorry.

1054
01:13:57,104 --> 01:14:00,107
[lawyer] <i>I'm gonna need a minute
of your time to go over Richard's will.</i>

1055
01:14:00,190 --> 01:14:02,609
<i>There are documents
that are time-sensitive.</i>

1056
01:14:03,110 --> 01:14:07,155
And also, I think it's best
we do it right away, for Tom's sake.

1057
01:14:08,198 --> 01:14:10,200
- Okay.
- Okay.

1058
01:14:17,583 --> 01:14:20,752
[lawyer] <i>Richard dictated this last draft
of the will to me personally,</i>

1059
01:14:20,836 --> 01:14:21,962
<i>and then he signed it.</i>

1060
01:14:22,504 --> 01:14:24,840
And because he was at the height
of his sickness,

1061
01:14:25,549 --> 01:14:27,718
I feel it's my obligation to assure you

1062
01:14:27,801 --> 01:14:31,305
that he was cogent and of sound mind
when he did so.

1063
01:14:33,098 --> 01:14:36,435
Richard left the bulk of his estate
to Madeline.

1064
01:14:40,147 --> 01:14:42,691
That's ridiculous, this… [stammers]
It should be Tom's.

1065
01:14:42,774 --> 01:14:47,362
Richard was very clear.
After the past incident with Tom…

1066
01:14:47,446 --> 01:14:51,950
- I had $350,000 stolen from me.
- He had major misgivings…

1067
01:14:52,034 --> 01:14:54,578
- And I had a nervous breakdown.
- …leaving Tom both the business

1068
01:14:54,661 --> 01:14:55,954
and the estate.

1069
01:14:58,874 --> 01:15:01,376
You'll be taken care of through a trust.

1070
01:15:02,002 --> 01:15:03,003
It's generous.

1071
01:15:03,921 --> 01:15:06,507
And it will allow you
to hold on to your bookstore.

1072
01:15:07,090 --> 01:15:10,093
Tom will also
retain control of the charity,

1073
01:15:10,177 --> 01:15:12,179
the Richard Hobbes Foundation.

1074
01:15:12,262 --> 01:15:15,682
As for everything else,
property, assets, shares, stocks,

1075
01:15:17,142 --> 01:15:19,061
the remaining 9.2 billion…

1076
01:15:20,854 --> 01:15:22,022
It will all go to Madeline.

1077
01:15:24,441 --> 01:15:27,277
[Tom] Well, at least
he trusted me with the Foundation.

1078
01:15:27,361 --> 01:15:30,405
[lawyer] He did, Tom.
You're chairman of the board.

1079
01:15:32,658 --> 01:15:35,160
And Madeline has been named trustee.

1080
01:15:37,454 --> 01:15:38,747
I'm a trustee?

1081
01:15:38,830 --> 01:15:40,374
[lawyer] It's only a formality.

1082
01:15:40,457 --> 01:15:44,211
A piece of insurance in the event
Tom is unable to fulfill his duties

1083
01:15:44,294 --> 01:15:47,089
- and Madeline will...
- [Tom] Will take over. Yeah, I get it.

1084
01:15:50,551 --> 01:15:53,762
[lawyer] He trusted you
with control of the Foundation.

1085
01:15:53,846 --> 01:15:56,139
I can tell you that
with complete sincerity.

1086
01:15:59,226 --> 01:16:00,936
- He thought the world of you.
- [Tom] Yeah, okay.

1087
01:16:01,019 --> 01:16:03,856
No offense, but my father's last wishes
tell me exactly what he thought of me.

1088
01:16:03,939 --> 01:16:08,735
[sighs, stammers] David, I'd like to
be alone with Tom for a minute,

1089
01:16:08,819 --> 01:16:10,404
- if that's okay.
- [David] Of course. Of course.

1090
01:16:10,487 --> 01:16:12,948
Um, thank you. Thank you.

1091
01:16:16,034 --> 01:16:17,327
I am so sorry.

1092
01:16:17,411 --> 01:16:19,496
- Don't be. It's not your fault.
- No, I just...

1093
01:16:19,580 --> 01:16:21,540
I want you to know that I'm your partner.

1094
01:16:22,541 --> 01:16:23,792
And that I'm here for you.

1095
01:16:25,169 --> 01:16:29,131
I'm here for whatever you need.
You don't have to go through this alone.

1096
01:16:29,214 --> 01:16:30,674
Thank you for saying that.

1097
01:16:30,757 --> 01:16:32,759
You can stay with me
for as long as you like.

1098
01:16:32,843 --> 01:16:34,803
You don't have to move out anytime soon.

1099
01:16:36,555 --> 01:16:39,474
But I'm gonna have to sell this apartment
because I can't do it.

1100
01:16:40,517 --> 01:16:44,229
I can't... I can't stay here alone.
I just can't.

1101
01:16:45,230 --> 01:16:46,315
I can't manage it.

1102
01:16:47,900 --> 01:16:50,110
- I don't know why I brought this up.
- Okay.

1103
01:16:50,194 --> 01:16:51,195
I shouldn't... I shouldn't...

1104
01:16:51,278 --> 01:16:53,030
- No, I get it.
- I shouldn't have brought it up right now.

1105
01:16:53,113 --> 01:16:55,240
- We can discuss it some other time.
- [sighs]

1106
01:16:55,324 --> 01:16:56,992
- I think it's just a lot.
- It's okay. It's okay.

1107
01:16:57,075 --> 01:16:59,286
It's a lot for both of us
to handle right now.

1108
01:17:07,044 --> 01:17:08,045
[exhales sharply]

1109
01:17:09,796 --> 01:17:10,797

1112
01:17:27,689 --> 01:17:30,025
- Thank you, Patrick.
- You're welcome, Miss Hobbes.

1113
01:17:33,779 --> 01:17:35,781
- Good morning, Charlie.
- How are you, Miss Hobbes?

1114

[song continues]

1115

[both speaking indistinctly]

1116
01:17:53,507 --> 01:17:55,342
I'm gonna check on the room.
I'll be right back.

1117
01:17:55,425 --> 01:17:56,510
Thank you so much.

1118
01:17:57,636 --> 01:17:59,096
[speaks indistinctly] …Mrs. Hobbes.

1119
01:17:59,805 --> 01:18:02,140
Oh, wow. Ooh.

1120
01:18:03,600 --> 01:18:05,352
[speaking indistinctly]

1121
01:18:05,435 --> 01:18:08,480
This is so pretty.
May I see the other tray?

1122
01:18:09,189 --> 01:18:10,190
[employee] Yes, of course.

[whispering] I have to tell you something.
I think I saw… [whispers indistinctly]

He's gonna be bored out of his mind.
Come talk to me in 20 years.

1131
01:18:49,229 --> 01:18:51,982
I'll be dealing with the exact same thing.
You know what I'm saying?

1132
01:18:52,649 --> 01:18:55,152
Oh, Mrs. Hobbes. Good morning.
I'm Pat Braddock.

1133
01:18:55,235 --> 01:18:57,404
We met briefly
at your husband's memorial service.

1134
01:18:58,655 --> 01:19:00,240
Yes, of course. How do you do?

1135
01:19:00,324 --> 01:19:01,742
[Braddock] I'm good. Thank you.

1136
01:19:01,825 --> 01:19:04,870
These are my associates,
Mr. McCabe, Mr. Mosely.

1137
01:19:06,246 --> 01:19:08,582
We're here to see Tom.
We're doing a bit of business for him.

1138
01:19:09,708 --> 01:19:11,084
What kind of business?

1139
01:19:11,168 --> 01:19:12,753
- [door opens]
- [Tom] Pat, hey.

1140
01:19:12,836 --> 01:19:14,254
- [Braddock] Oh.
- It's okay, Madeline.

1141
01:19:14,338 --> 01:19:15,881
- Braddock is an old family friend.
- Hi, Tom.

1142
01:19:15,964 --> 01:19:17,758
Good to see you. He did work for my father

1143
01:19:17,841 --> 01:19:20,385
whenever he had anything sensitive
he needed taken care of.

1144
01:19:20,928 --> 01:19:23,096
[Tom] Actually, Madeline, uh,
I want you to see this.

1145
01:19:23,764 --> 01:19:26,850
Tom enlisted our help to find
the young woman who committed the theft.

1146
01:19:26,934 --> 01:19:28,685
After running her picture
through the system,

1147
01:19:28,769 --> 01:19:31,563
we landed on this woman.
We think this is her.

1148
01:19:35,484 --> 01:19:36,527
- That's her.
- [Braddock] All right.

1149
01:19:36,610 --> 01:19:37,861
So her name is Sandra Carmichael.

1150
01:19:37,945 --> 01:19:40,364
She was born in Seattle. Rough childhood.

1151
01:19:40,864 --> 01:19:43,700
Talked to the mother, but she
hasn't spoken to her in several years.

1152
01:19:43,784 --> 01:19:46,203
Okay, she, uh,
drops out of high school at 16,

1153
01:19:46,286 --> 01:19:48,205
starts racking up a number of offenses.

1154
01:19:48,288 --> 01:19:50,666
Shoplifting, possession, assault.

1155
01:19:51,166 --> 01:19:52,501
But then she develops a habit,

1156
01:19:52,584 --> 01:19:55,754
and she crisscrosses the country
until she makes her way to Queens,

1157
01:19:55,838 --> 01:19:57,714
where she's arrested again for possession.

1158
01:19:57,798 --> 01:20:00,634
She gets paroled
and that's where the trail runs cold.

1159
01:20:01,635 --> 01:20:04,137
[Madeline] Okay, so that's it.
She's a drug addict.

1160
01:20:04,221 --> 01:20:06,640
[Braddock] Well, frankly,
it raises some questions.

1161
01:20:07,182 --> 01:20:08,767
- What kind of questions?
- Yeah, like what?

1162
01:20:08,851 --> 01:20:11,061
[Braddock] What she pulled
required a great deal of sophistication.

1163
01:20:11,144 --> 01:20:13,105
I don't see how this woman did it alone.

1164
01:20:13,188 --> 01:20:15,023
I think we're looking
for more than one person.

1165
01:20:16,441 --> 01:20:18,902
- [Braddock] We'll keep you posted.
- Thank you. I really appreciate this.

1166
01:20:18,986 --> 01:20:21,697
- [Braddock] We're gonna get 'em.
- Okay. No… [stammers] …I trust you.

1167
01:20:23,156 --> 01:20:25,826
- We'll talk to you soon, all right?
- Okay. Yeah.

1168
01:21:04,281 --> 01:21:05,657
[elevator dings]

1169
01:21:11,079 --> 01:21:12,080
[Madeline] Hi!

1170
01:21:13,624 --> 01:21:14,750
Hi!

1171
01:21:18,170 --> 01:21:21,173
- I didn't know you could cook.
- Not bad for a trophy wife, huh?

1172
01:21:22,090 --> 01:21:25,385
[chuckles] I mean, your dad told me
what you said about me.

1173
01:21:25,469 --> 01:21:28,805
- Sorry. I didn't know you then.
- Oh, I don't care.

1174
01:21:28,889 --> 01:21:31,141
- It was more about him.
- I honestly... I really don't care.

1175
01:21:32,059 --> 01:21:33,268
You hungry?

1176
01:21:33,352 --> 01:21:36,313
Uh, yeah. I could eat.
Let me just put my stuff down.

1177
01:21:41,235 --> 01:21:43,403
[Madeline] <i>Did you have any luck
finding that girl?</i>

1178
01:21:43,487 --> 01:21:47,157
Uh, not yet. Uh, Braddock had a lead
down in Miami but it was a bust.

1179
01:21:48,575 --> 01:21:49,785
[sighs] Honey, you know,

1180
01:21:49,868 --> 01:21:55,165
what these people did to you was awful
and confusing and unfair.

1181
01:21:55,249 --> 01:22:00,003
But I don't think that finding her
is gonna make you feel any better.

1182
01:22:01,421 --> 01:22:02,422
I disagree.

1183
01:22:03,298 --> 01:22:04,424
Yeah, well...

1184
01:22:05,008 --> 01:22:07,928
Okay. Hang on, I... I have
something I wanna show you. [chuckles]

1185
01:22:08,011 --> 01:22:10,722
So, I, um… [humming]

1186
01:22:10,806 --> 01:22:14,226
…started looking for apartments for you.

1187
01:22:14,309 --> 01:22:16,395
These are all downtown near the bookstore,

1188
01:22:16,478 --> 01:22:18,564
so it wouldn't be much of a commute.

1189
01:22:18,647 --> 01:22:20,107
- What is this?
- Well, I told you.

1190
01:22:20,190 --> 01:22:22,693
I'm gonna have to sell this apartment,
so I want you to find a place.

1191
01:22:22,776 --> 01:22:24,528
I know, but I don't need you
to do this for me.

1192
01:22:24,611 --> 01:22:25,779
But I want to, sweetheart.

1193
01:22:25,863 --> 01:22:28,365
- I wanna help you with this.
- I get that. I'm just saying that

1194
01:22:28,448 --> 01:22:30,993
- I can find my own apartment. Thank you.
- [chuckles] Why are you getting upset?

1195
01:22:31,076 --> 01:22:32,244
- I'm not.
- No, you are.

1196
01:22:32,327 --> 01:22:34,037
- No, I'm not. I'm just...
- You totally are getting upset.

1197
01:22:34,121 --> 01:22:36,290
- You can't come here and do this…
- No, but I want to.

1198
01:22:36,373 --> 01:22:37,666
- …and expect me not to react.
- I wanna be a part of this.

1199
01:22:37,749 --> 01:22:41,211
- It's not your problem. You're not my mom!
- No, you're right. I'm not.

1200
01:22:41,295 --> 01:22:43,547
'Cause if I were, I'd tell you
to grow the fuck up.

1201
01:22:48,468 --> 01:22:51,263
People get their hearts broken every day.

1202
01:22:51,346 --> 01:22:53,473
It happens to everybody, okay?

1203
01:22:55,309 --> 01:22:56,310
All the time.

1204
01:22:58,103 --> 01:23:02,149
But most kids aren't entitled enough
to hire men to find the girl who did it.

1205
01:23:02,232 --> 01:23:03,317
She stole money from me.

1206
01:23:03,400 --> 01:23:05,819
That's not why you're doing it.
You want to see her again.

1207
01:23:06,737 --> 01:23:07,738
Right?

1208
01:23:10,908 --> 01:23:13,035
You can lie to yourself,
but you can't lie to me.

1209
01:23:16,413 --> 01:23:17,414
[sniffs]

1210
01:23:20,209 --> 01:23:21,919
I'm sorry. That was harsh. [chuckles]

1211
01:23:22,002 --> 01:23:23,545
- You think I'm a loser.
- No, I don't.

1212
01:23:23,629 --> 01:23:25,464
- Yeah, you do.
- No, I don't think that you're a loser.

1213
01:23:25,547 --> 01:23:26,632
I think that…

1214
01:23:29,468 --> 01:23:30,802
I think that you're human.

1215
01:23:33,096 --> 01:23:36,475
I think we're all human.

1216
01:23:36,558 --> 01:23:38,101
We're just doing the best we can.

1217
01:23:43,565 --> 01:23:45,150
I'll have Braddock call it off.

1218
01:23:48,946 --> 01:23:52,074
Good for you, sweetheart.
I know it's hard.

1219
01:23:55,369 --> 01:23:58,413
[realtor] <i>This apartment is unlisted.
You're the first people to see it.</i>

1220
01:23:58,497 --> 01:24:00,040
- Oh, that's exciting.
- [phone rings]

1221
01:24:00,123 --> 01:24:01,458
- This is a great neighborhood.
- Hello?

1222
01:24:01,542 --> 01:24:03,252
- There are lots of young people here.
- Yeah?

1223
01:24:03,335 --> 01:24:04,503
Well, Tom has a bookstore

1224
01:24:04,586 --> 01:24:06,004
- on Thompson Street…
- Yeah. Okay.

1225
01:24:06,088 --> 01:24:08,382
- …so this may be absolutely perfect.
- Bring her to the apartment. Yeah.

1226
01:24:08,465 --> 01:24:10,843
- Honey, what... what's going on?
- Okay. Thanks.

1227
01:24:10,926 --> 01:24:12,177
Um, they found her.

1228
01:24:12,886 --> 01:24:15,264
I... I... I thought you told them
to stop looking for her?

1229
01:24:15,347 --> 01:24:19,351
Well, I did... I did. Uh, but they had
one last lead and they found her. Um…

1230
01:24:19,434 --> 01:24:21,395
- [stammers] Where is she?
- They're bringing her to the apartment.

1231
01:24:21,478 --> 01:24:23,605
I just wanna talk to her. I have to go.
I'm sorry.

1232
01:24:23,689 --> 01:24:26,608
I'm so sorry. We're gonna have to
do this another time. Thank you so much.

1233
01:24:28,026 --> 01:24:29,695
- We've got her in the guest room.
- [Tom] Okay.

1234
01:24:29,778 --> 01:24:33,866
She was living in the Lincoln Motel
off the Cross Bronx Expressway.

1235
01:24:34,616 --> 01:24:39,204
And she has a serious heroin addiction.
She's fallen since you've seen her, Tom.

1236
01:24:39,288 --> 01:24:41,415
All right? Hold on. Just wait a second.

1237
01:24:43,375 --> 01:24:45,252
We gave her a sedative to calm her down,

1238
01:24:45,335 --> 01:24:48,589
but she's gonna be experiencing
some pretty heavy withdrawal so...

1239
01:24:48,672 --> 01:24:50,465
- Can I go in and talk to her?
- I'm gonna go with you.

1240
01:24:50,549 --> 01:24:52,134
No. I'm okay.

1241
01:24:54,970 --> 01:24:55,971
[door opens]

1242
01:24:57,431 --> 01:24:58,432
[door closes]

1243
01:25:03,437 --> 01:25:05,063
Did she say anything else?

1244
01:25:06,773 --> 01:25:07,941
You have any more insight?

1245
01:25:09,943 --> 01:25:11,320
Not yet.

1246
01:25:11,403 --> 01:25:12,404
[door closes]

1247
01:25:23,624 --> 01:25:24,708
You all right, sweetheart?

1248
01:25:24,791 --> 01:25:25,792
Yeah.

1249
01:25:28,754 --> 01:25:30,088
Yeah. I'm okay.

1250
01:25:30,797 --> 01:25:33,383
It's weird.
It's like, it's her, but it's not her.

1251
01:25:33,467 --> 01:25:34,676
[Braddock] Did she tell you anything?

1252
01:25:34,760 --> 01:25:37,095
[breathes shakily] Yeah, you were right.

1253
01:25:37,930 --> 01:25:42,100
She wasn't working alone. There was...
There's this guy who was her accomplice.

1254
01:25:42,184 --> 01:25:45,646
He taught her everything and trained her.

1255
01:25:45,729 --> 01:25:47,064
He planned the whole thing.

1256
01:25:47,147 --> 01:25:51,360
She said that he has
some sort of connection to... to us.

1257
01:25:51,985 --> 01:25:53,654
What kind of connection?

1258
01:25:53,737 --> 01:25:57,574
She said that he knew all about me.
She said that it seemed personal.

1259
01:25:59,618 --> 01:26:01,453
Did she describe him?

1260
01:26:01,537 --> 01:26:05,040
- Did she say what he looked like at all?
- No, but he cheated her too.

1261
01:26:05,832 --> 01:26:07,000
He left her with nothing.

1262
01:26:09,419 --> 01:26:11,088
I told her she could stay here…

1263
01:26:11,171 --> 01:26:13,966
- Oh, no, no, no, no. She can't stay here.
- …and, um…

1264
01:26:14,049 --> 01:26:15,050
- She's sick…
- No.

1265
01:26:15,133 --> 01:26:16,593
- …and she needs a place to detox…
- No.

1266
01:26:16,677 --> 01:26:19,429
- …and she regrets what she did.
- She's a junkie, you can't trust her.

1267
01:26:19,513 --> 01:26:20,931
- She's gonna do anything to get money.
- I agree.

1268
01:26:21,014 --> 01:26:22,808
- Very easy for me to do.
- No. She's staying here.

1269
01:26:22,891 --> 01:26:25,394
I'll take care of her.
I'll bring doctors or nurses, or whatever.

1270
01:26:25,477 --> 01:26:27,688
- But I wanna do this.
- Mr. Braddock, this isn't safe.

1271
01:26:27,771 --> 01:26:29,690
- I need your help with this.
- Well, I...

1272
01:26:29,773 --> 01:26:33,026
Look, I can put men outside her room.
She'll essentially be under lock and key.

1273
01:26:33,110 --> 01:26:35,487
That's not what I'm worried about.
But, come on.

1274
01:26:35,988 --> 01:26:37,614
I mean, are you ready
for when she sobers up

1275
01:26:37,698 --> 01:26:40,492
- and you have to see the real her?
- I'm dying to see the real her.

1276
01:26:40,576 --> 01:26:43,245
Okay. If she's gonna stay here,
then I need to talk to her.

1277
01:26:43,787 --> 01:26:45,831
- No, wait. She needs to rest.
- No, I should.

1278
01:27:32,503 --> 01:27:33,504
Sandra?

1279
01:27:35,464 --> 01:27:36,465
Sandra?

1280
01:27:41,970 --> 01:27:43,138
Hi, I'm Madeline.

1281
01:27:44,139 --> 01:27:47,601
I was married to Tom's father.
I'm his stepmother.

1282
01:27:50,187 --> 01:27:53,565
Suck my dick, you lying bitch.

1283
01:27:53,649 --> 01:27:54,608
[chuckles]

1284
01:27:55,609 --> 01:27:57,653
[Sandra] Yeah, I know who you are,
Madeline.

1285
01:27:59,613 --> 01:28:01,240
Max told me the whole score.

1286
01:28:01,949 --> 01:28:02,908
[sniffs]

1287
01:28:02,991 --> 01:28:06,203
That you set the cops on him,
but then had to beg him to come back.

1288
01:28:06,703 --> 01:28:10,958
How there was an old man who was dying
and was gonna leave behind a fortune,

1289
01:28:11,041 --> 01:28:12,501
and all we needed to do was…

1290
01:28:13,919 --> 01:28:15,087
nudge aside the son

1291
01:28:15,170 --> 01:28:17,881
so that his very full of shit widow
could inherit it all.

1292
01:28:19,633 --> 01:28:20,801
So, what do you want?

1293
01:28:20,884 --> 01:28:23,387
[Sandra] I wanna confess.
Confess to it all

1294
01:28:24,054 --> 01:28:25,806
and get this off my chest.

1295
01:28:25,889 --> 01:28:28,517
[inhales sharply]
Do me a favor and get Tom. Tom?

1296
01:28:28,600 --> 01:28:30,102
- How much?
- [chuckles]

1297
01:28:31,019 --> 01:28:32,521
I don't want your money, bitch.

1298
01:28:33,272 --> 01:28:34,273
You don't?

1299
01:28:34,773 --> 01:28:36,859
Max and I were supposed to meet
at Penn Station.

1300
01:28:37,568 --> 01:28:38,986
I waited there for three days.

1301
01:28:39,570 --> 01:28:43,198
Because I was so fucking stupid,
I thought something had happened to him.

1302
01:28:43,907 --> 01:28:45,742
[inhales deeply] Can you believe that?

1303
01:28:48,704 --> 01:28:49,705
He left me.

1304
01:28:52,040 --> 01:28:55,169
[smacks lips, inhales deeply]
Then what can I do for you?

1305
01:29:00,674 --> 01:29:01,884
I want Max.

1306
01:29:03,510 --> 01:29:05,095
I wanna see Max.

1307
01:29:07,097 --> 01:29:10,434
I wanna look into his face,
and I want him to see what he did to me.

1308
01:29:12,811 --> 01:29:15,439
- I wanna see Max.
- [chuckles]

1309
01:29:15,522 --> 01:29:17,941
Honey, I don't know where he is.

1310
01:29:18,025 --> 01:29:19,985
Well, you better find out.
[breathes shakily]

1311
01:29:20,611 --> 01:29:23,906
Or I will tell everyone in the next room
who you really fucking are.

1312
01:29:32,831 --> 01:29:33,916
She can stay.

1313
01:29:35,626 --> 01:29:37,211
[voice mail speaker] <i>Your call
has been forwarded</i>

1314
01:29:37,294 --> 01:29:39,213
<i>to an automated voice message system.</i>

1315
01:29:39,296 --> 01:29:40,672
<i>When you are finished recording,</i>

1316
01:29:40,756 --> 01:29:43,967
<i>you may hang up

1317
01:29:44,051 --> 01:29:45,260
[beeps]

1318
01:29:45,344 --> 01:29:46,762
So, I have a problem.

1319
01:29:46,845 --> 01:29:51,308
They found your girl getting high
off the Cross Bronx Expressway.

1320
01:29:51,391 --> 01:29:54,811
And now she's in my apartment
pining after you.

1321
01:29:55,729 --> 01:29:58,148
You really did a number on her,
didn't you?

1322
01:29:58,232 --> 01:30:00,484
You d... You didn't have to go that hard.

1323
01:30:00,567 --> 01:30:02,861
I mean, what the fuck did you tell her?

1324
01:30:03,362 --> 01:30:04,363
Call me.

1325
01:30:05,030 --> 01:30:07,824
[Sandra speaks indistinctly]

1326
01:30:08,325 --> 01:30:10,494
Where is he? Where is he?

1327

[Sandra crying]

1330
01:30:48,031 --> 01:30:50,659
[screaming] Did you find him?

1331
01:30:52,286 --> 01:30:54,162
- [door closes]
- Did you find him? [sobbing]

<i>When you are finished recording,</i>

1333
01:30:56,039 --> 01:30:58,792

or press one for more options.</i>

1334
01:30:58,876 --> 01:30:59,710
[beeps]

1335
01:30:59,793 --> 01:31:03,922
[Madeline] <i>Max. Uh, hey, it's me again.
Um, can you give me a call?</i>

1336
01:31:06,592 --> 01:31:09,261
[Sandra crying, moaning]

1337
01:31:21,773 --> 01:31:23,859
[Sandra] <i>Max told me the whole score.</i>

1338
01:31:23,942 --> 01:31:25,110
<i>And I know who you are.</i>

1339
01:31:25,652 --> 01:31:27,696
[Madeline] <i>Please call me back.
I need you.</i>

1340
01:31:27,779 --> 01:31:28,906
[Sandra] <i>I want Max.</i>

1341
01:31:30,824 --> 01:31:33,702
<i>I wanna see Max. I wanna see Max.</i>

1342
01:31:33,785 --> 01:31:35,662
[Madeline] <i>Just please call me back.
Come on, Max. Please.</i>

1343
01:31:35,746 --> 01:31:37,289
[Sandra] <i>Or I will tell everyone
in the next room</i>

1344
01:31:37,372 --> 01:31:38,457

[phone dings]

1346
01:31:46,673 --> 01:31:48,884
[Max] <i>Listen, I came back like you asked.</i>

1347
01:31:48,967 --> 01:31:52,304
<i>I gave Tom a nervous breakdown.
I got my money. Now I'm out.</i>

1348
01:31:52,387 --> 01:31:55,307
[stammers] Uh, yeah, but I, um...
[clicks tongue]

1349
01:31:56,058 --> 01:31:57,476
It's just that I, um…

1350
01:32:00,062 --> 01:32:01,063
I think…

1351
01:32:02,606 --> 01:32:03,607
I want you back.

1352
01:32:07,319 --> 01:32:08,403
[Max] <i>You want me back?</i>

1353
01:32:11,573 --> 01:32:12,574
Yeah.

1354
01:32:14,993 --> 01:32:17,913
[Max] <i>You want me back to fix this.</i>

1355
01:32:18,997 --> 01:32:20,415
Fuck, yes. [sighs, sniffs]

1356
01:32:20,958 --> 01:32:23,085
- [Sandra] Put that down...
- [Tom] Yeah, I know that's right.

1357
01:32:23,168 --> 01:32:25,337
- [Sandra] Okay. And then I'm gonna...
- [Tom] You're winning…

1358
01:32:25,420 --> 01:32:26,255
[Sandra chuckles]

1359
01:32:26,338 --> 01:32:28,048
…so I don't understand
why you have so many questions.

1360
01:32:28,131 --> 01:32:30,008
Are you cheating me? You hustling me?

1361
01:32:30,092 --> 01:32:32,928
Hi. How's our young patient doing?

1362
01:32:33,011 --> 01:32:35,597
- I'm doing a lot better. Thanks.
- Yeah, last night was rough,

1363
01:32:35,681 --> 01:32:38,016
- but I think we're over the hump.
- Mmm, that's a relief.

1364
01:32:38,100 --> 01:32:39,142
You look a lot better.

1365
01:32:40,310 --> 01:32:42,062
I was gonna take a walk.
Do you want to join me?

1366
01:32:42,688 --> 01:32:45,357
Uh, no. Uh, you know,
she's still not 100%.

1367
01:32:45,440 --> 01:32:47,359
I think the fresh air might do her good.

1368
01:32:48,360 --> 01:32:50,112
- Uh, I don't know about that.
- No. [stammers]

1369
01:32:50,195 --> 01:32:52,531
- A walk would be perfect.
- Oh, good. Brought you a sweater.

1370
01:32:57,411 --> 01:32:58,996
That was fast. Where was he?

1371
01:32:59,079 --> 01:33:00,497
You can ask him yourself.

1372
01:33:02,165 --> 01:33:03,250
We have a deal, right?

1373
01:33:04,293 --> 01:33:06,044
Once you see him, you get out of my life.

1374
01:33:07,129 --> 01:33:09,006
- I don't want anything from you.
- Good.

1375
01:33:15,512 --> 01:33:16,889
How can you do what you do?

1376
01:33:18,223 --> 01:33:19,224
Practice.

1377
01:33:27,065 --> 01:33:28,192
[elevator bell dings]

1378
01:33:28,275 --> 01:33:29,735
[elevator door opens]

1379
01:33:48,295 --> 01:33:49,296
Where are we going?

1380
01:34:28,043 --> 01:34:29,044
This is good.

1381
01:34:34,132 --> 01:34:35,342
[car door opens]

1382
01:34:40,848 --> 01:34:41,849
[car door closes]

1383
01:35:00,242 --> 01:35:01,410
You left me!

1384
01:35:01,493 --> 01:35:05,038
You li... I waited for days!
You fucking left me!

1385
01:35:05,622 --> 01:35:06,540
How could you?

1386
01:35:06,623 --> 01:35:08,792
You threw me aside
like I was fucking trash!

1387
01:35:08,876 --> 01:35:09,877
[panting]

1388
01:35:13,338 --> 01:35:16,133
Oh, my God. Please. You done?

1389
01:35:17,718 --> 01:35:19,803
You got taken. That's what we do.

1390
01:35:20,721 --> 01:35:23,432
So now, the question is,
how do we make this right by you?

1391
01:35:24,057 --> 01:35:25,475
I want him to apologize.

1392
01:35:26,435 --> 01:35:28,020
Well, he can't. Because he's not sorry.

1393
01:35:28,562 --> 01:35:32,399
[breathes shakily] Did you feel anything
for me? [breathes deeply]

1394
01:35:33,984 --> 01:35:34,985
I felt nothing.

1395
01:35:39,656 --> 01:35:41,033
What the fuck is this?

1396
01:35:47,122 --> 01:35:47,998
Shit.

1397
01:35:56,548 --> 01:35:57,966
What did I tell you?

1398
01:35:58,050 --> 01:36:01,428
She's used these two to swipe
your inheritance right out from under you.

1399
01:36:02,804 --> 01:36:04,014
What? You have nothing to say?

1400
01:36:05,891 --> 01:36:07,601
The inheritance belongs to Tom.

1401
01:36:07,684 --> 01:36:10,479
And you're gonna give it back to him.
It's his money.

1402
01:36:10,562 --> 01:36:12,940
[Madeline] If it was Tom's money,
he would have his money.

1403
01:36:13,023 --> 01:36:14,024
But it's my money.

1404
01:36:14,775 --> 01:36:16,485
And you know what I'm gonna do
with my money?

1405
01:36:16,568 --> 01:36:19,321
I'm gonna take a billion dollars
and aim it in your direction.

1406
01:36:19,404 --> 01:36:23,200
Your three-bedroom in Scarsdale
or Lloyd Harbor, or whatever the fuck.

1407
01:36:23,283 --> 01:36:26,370
It's gone. Your Benz. Gone.
Your kids' college fund.

1408
01:36:26,453 --> 01:36:29,289
[chuckling] By the time I'm done with you,
it's all gone.

1409
01:36:29,373 --> 01:36:31,041
[Tom] 'Cause it's
all about the money for you, right?

1410
01:36:31,124 --> 01:36:33,544
That's all any of you care about
is the money.

1411
01:36:34,127 --> 01:36:35,254
Right, Sandra?

1412
01:36:38,465 --> 01:36:42,469
Hey! Say something! Answer me!

1413
01:36:46,682 --> 01:36:48,934
- Whoa! Hey, hey. Tom. Tom. No.
- [Madeline] Hey! Hey, hey.

1414
01:36:49,017 --> 01:36:50,769
You've been fucking with me
since we first met.

1415
01:36:50,853 --> 01:36:53,021
- Tom…
- Put the gun down. Put it down.

1416
01:36:53,105 --> 01:36:55,691
You took everything. [breathes heavily]

1417
01:36:55,774 --> 01:36:57,860
- [Sandra] I'm sorry.
- You're a fucking liar. Don't say...

1418
01:36:57,943 --> 01:36:59,695
[Madeline] Tom, put it down. Come on.
Put the gun down.

1419
01:36:59,778 --> 01:37:01,780
- [Max] Put the gun down. Tom.
- Put the gun down.

1420
01:37:01,864 --> 01:37:04,867
I meant what I said, Tom.
I meant what I said.

1421
01:37:04,950 --> 01:37:06,743
[Sandra breathing shakily]

1422
01:37:06,827 --> 01:37:09,329
[Tom breathing shakily]

1423
01:37:19,590 --> 01:37:22,593
[groans] You're right. You're right.
It's not you.

1424
01:37:25,429 --> 01:37:27,431
- Tom, no! What are you doing?
- Hey. No. No, no, no, no. Tom, no.

1425
01:37:27,514 --> 01:37:28,724
You did this. You ruined us.

1426
01:37:28,807 --> 01:37:31,768
Look at me. Look what you did to me.
Look what you did to my dad!

1427
01:37:31,852 --> 01:37:34,188
I took care of your father.
I kept him alive.

1428
01:37:34,271 --> 01:37:36,190
- Bullshit!
- Tom, please don't do this.

1429
01:37:36,273 --> 01:37:37,274
Just sh-shut up.

1430
01:37:37,357 --> 01:37:39,401
Tom, put it do... Put the gun down, okay?

1431
01:37:41,278 --> 01:37:44,448
Please, just put it down. Put it down.

1432
01:37:44,531 --> 01:37:45,616
- [grunts]
- [gun fires]

1433
01:37:45,699 --> 01:37:47,242
[Madeline screams]

1434
01:37:48,535 --> 01:37:50,078
[Sandra] Tom, no.

1435
01:37:50,162 --> 01:37:51,580
[Braddock] No!

1436
01:37:51,663 --> 01:37:53,207
- [Madeline] Stay back.
- Put the gun down.

1437
01:37:53,290 --> 01:37:54,166
St... Stay back.

1438
01:37:54,249 --> 01:37:56,460
- Put the gun down, Madeline.
- You wanna kill me, Madeline?

1439
01:37:56,543 --> 01:37:58,545
- Get back. Tom, no.
- You wanna shoot me? Just do it!

1440
01:37:58,629 --> 01:38:01,006
- [Max] Hey! Tom.
- Just do it.

1441
01:38:01,089 --> 01:38:02,090
[Madeline gasps]

1442
01:38:04,927 --> 01:38:07,304
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
- [Sandra] What? What h...

1443
01:38:07,387 --> 01:38:08,430
Tom?

1444
01:38:08,514 --> 01:38:10,807
- [breathing heavily, crying]
- [Braddock] Come on. Stay with me.

1445
01:38:11,808 --> 01:38:13,227
Tom.

1446
01:38:16,188 --> 01:38:17,189
[Max] What the fuck?

1447
01:38:20,526 --> 01:38:21,527
[Braddock] Oh, my God.

1448
01:38:24,488 --> 01:38:25,364
You killed him.

1449
01:38:25,989 --> 01:38:29,409
[stammers] I didn't. He... He...
He shot himself. You saw it.

1450
01:38:29,493 --> 01:38:30,494
- Call the police.
- [person] I'm on it.

1451
01:38:30,577 --> 01:38:32,246
- [Madeline] No!
- He killed himself.

1452
01:38:32,329 --> 01:38:35,707
I'm sorry, what? Who the fuck are you?
Shut the fuck up. You're a part of this.

1453
01:38:35,791 --> 01:38:38,377
- I need to report a shooting.
- I didn't do it. I... I...

1454
01:38:38,460 --> 01:38:40,462
- I didn't kill him. [stammers]
- Yes, there's been a shooting.

1455
01:38:40,546 --> 01:38:43,298
A-A young man's been shot in the chest.
I'm not sure.

1456
01:38:43,382 --> 01:38:46,176
This... This kid is dead. This is a...
This is... This is a tragedy.

1457
01:38:46,260 --> 01:38:49,263
- But I... [stammers] I... I didn't...
- No, she didn't. He killed himself.

1458
01:38:49,346 --> 01:38:51,139
I can make amends. I can...

1459
01:38:51,223 --> 01:38:52,975
- I can make amends.
- I'm sorry, what?

1460
01:38:54,059 --> 01:38:55,185
I'll give the money back.

1461
01:38:55,269 --> 01:38:57,479
- I'll give it to the Foundation.
- What are you talking about?

1462
01:38:57,563 --> 01:38:59,273
- You're just gonna give it up?
- Yes.

1463
01:38:59,982 --> 01:39:02,901
I don't want to go to jail
for something I didn't do!

1464
01:39:02,985 --> 01:39:04,987
No. They're coming. The police are coming.

1465
01:39:05,070 --> 01:39:08,657
[Madeline] You leave us to the police
and that money's not going anywhere.

1466
01:39:08,740 --> 01:39:11,451
- Just think of what it can do.
- Oh, you. [breathes deeply]

1467
01:39:11,952 --> 01:39:13,620
They'll give the money back!

1468
01:39:13,704 --> 01:39:18,709
Please! Please! I beg you, please!
I don't wanna go to jail!

1469
01:39:22,004 --> 01:39:23,255
What a fucking mess.

1470
01:39:23,338 --> 01:39:26,341
[line ringing]

1471
01:39:27,467 --> 01:39:30,429
[assistant] Madeline Hobbes on line one.
She says it's urgent.

1472
01:39:31,180 --> 01:39:32,681
Excuse me a minute. [sighs]

1473
01:39:34,141 --> 01:39:36,852
Madeline… Hello?

1474
01:39:38,145 --> 01:39:39,146
<i>Is everything all right?</i>

1475
01:39:40,230 --> 01:39:42,107
[Madeline]
<i>I wanna transfer my inheritance…</i>

1476
01:39:43,066 --> 01:39:44,985
<i>to the Richard Hobbes Foundation.</i>

1477
01:39:46,069 --> 01:39:48,947
[David] <i>It was Richard's wish that you
receive the inheritance, Madeline.</i>

1478
01:39:49,031 --> 01:39:50,032
<i>It's yours.</i>

1479
01:39:50,115 --> 01:39:51,783
But I want it to go to the Foundation.

1480
01:39:52,910 --> 01:39:54,786
[stammers] And I want it done today.

1481
01:39:56,663 --> 01:39:59,833
I need you to do this, David.
I need you to do this as soon as possible.

1482
01:40:00,584 --> 01:40:02,628
[David] <i>Madeline, what is this?
Are you under duress?</i>

1483
01:40:05,422 --> 01:40:06,507
No.

1484
01:40:07,174 --> 01:40:09,635
[David] <i>You can tell me
if something has happened. I can help.</i>

1485
01:40:11,345 --> 01:40:13,430
[Braddock] Next flight out is
to Oklahoma City.

1486
01:40:13,514 --> 01:40:15,766
We have 40 minutes. Keep moving.

1487
01:40:16,350 --> 01:40:20,020
[David] <i>Madeline?
Have you spoken to Tom about this?</i>

1488
01:40:25,234 --> 01:40:26,485
You're my lawyer, right?

1489
01:40:27,861 --> 01:40:29,363
[David] <i>Yes. Of course.</i>

1490
01:40:34,535 --> 01:40:37,371
[Madeline] <i>Then I want you to
do what I say and transfer the money.</i>

1491
01:40:43,043 --> 01:40:44,044
All of it.

1492
01:40:46,213 --> 01:40:47,631
[David] <i>We'll prepare the papers.</i>

1493
01:40:56,974 --> 01:40:58,559
[Braddock] Make it look like a robbery.

1494
01:40:59,852 --> 01:41:01,228
[engine starts]

1495
01:41:01,311 --> 01:41:03,313
[people chattering]

1496
01:41:22,916 --> 01:41:23,917
[grunts]

1497
01:41:27,337 --> 01:41:29,590
You seem very calm
for someone who lost a lot of money.

1498
01:41:29,673 --> 01:41:30,966
Well, I'm a professional.

1499
01:41:31,675 --> 01:41:33,468
You gave away billions of dollars.

1500
01:41:33,552 --> 01:41:35,012
- Is that what I did?
- Did you?

1501
01:41:35,095 --> 01:41:36,180
I don't know. Did I?

1502
01:41:36,680 --> 01:41:39,600
I mean, I gave the money
to the Foundation.

1503
01:41:40,392 --> 01:41:42,311
The head of the Foundation is Tom.

1504
01:41:42,394 --> 01:41:46,273
Or should I say, was. [sighs]

1505
01:41:46,356 --> 01:41:47,524
- [Max] Tom is dead.
- [Madeline] Mm-hmm.

1506
01:41:47,608 --> 01:41:50,861
And so, the money
is controlled by the trustee.

1507
01:41:50,944 --> 01:41:52,112
And guess who that is?

1508
01:41:58,076 --> 01:42:00,120
You're still talking about money.

1509
01:42:00,787 --> 01:42:02,581
Yes. Yes, we are.

1510
01:42:03,498 --> 01:42:04,666
[Sandra] Tom is dead.

1511
01:42:06,126 --> 01:42:08,629
We killed him. [breathes shakily]

1512
01:42:09,421 --> 01:42:10,422
We killed him.

1513
01:42:10,506 --> 01:42:12,591
- Keep it together.
- I'm gonna be sick.

1514
01:42:16,303 --> 01:42:18,180
[Madeline groans] We gotta get rid of her.

1515
01:42:19,598 --> 01:42:22,518
We can't. She's a witness.
She knows too much.

1516
01:42:23,602 --> 01:42:26,063
What is it? Did she get to you?

1517
01:42:27,773 --> 01:42:28,774
[chuckles] No.

1518
01:42:29,316 --> 01:42:31,318
It's okay. I mean, it happens.

1519
01:42:31,401 --> 01:42:32,653
She didn't get to me.

1520
01:42:33,153 --> 01:42:36,073
[smacks lips] I mean, you can do
what you want.

1521
01:42:36,156 --> 01:42:37,658
[chuckles] I don't care.

1522
01:42:39,076 --> 01:42:41,537
- She didn't get to me.
- Good.

1523
01:42:42,204 --> 01:42:43,664
[flight attendant]
Would you like some water?

1524
01:42:45,082 --> 01:42:46,083
Thanks.

1525
01:42:57,594 --> 01:42:59,721
- [Madeline] This isn't blood.
- What?

1526
01:42:59,805 --> 01:43:01,557
Look. It comes out too easily.

1527
01:43:03,183 --> 01:43:04,518
- This isn't blood.
- Let me see.

1528
01:43:06,979 --> 01:43:08,397
If it's not blood, then what is it?

1529
01:43:10,899 --> 01:43:11,900
Uh, you tell me.

1530
01:43:13,443 --> 01:43:14,444
What do you mean?

1531
01:43:15,028 --> 01:43:16,029
Are you behind this?

1532
01:43:17,865 --> 01:43:19,950
- Behind what?
- You got me to give away the money.

1533
01:43:21,326 --> 01:43:25,122
- [chuckling] No, I did no such thing.
- No, Tom's alive. You fucked me.

1534
01:43:25,205 --> 01:43:26,623
- What are you talking about?
- You fucked me.

1535
01:43:26,707 --> 01:43:28,041
- I will fucking kill you.
- I didn't have anything...

1536
01:43:28,125 --> 01:43:30,544
- I will fucking end you!
- I didn't have anything to do with this.

1537
01:43:34,047 --> 01:43:35,215
Sandra.

1538
01:43:43,098 --> 01:43:45,601
Sandra! Sandra?

1539
01:44:01,366 --> 01:44:04,369
- [Sandra] <i>Merry Christmas, Max.</i>
- [Max] <i>Merry Christmas, Sandra.</i>

1540
01:44:04,453 --> 01:44:06,914
[Sandra] <i>Sandy. Everybody calls me Sandy.</i>

1541
01:44:07,831 --> 01:44:09,291
[Max] <i>We're gonna give people
the impression</i>

1542
01:44:09,374 --> 01:44:10,751
<i>that you're somebody that you're not.</i>

1543
01:44:11,251 --> 01:44:13,378
<i>And when I'm done with you,
it's gonna be 100% convincing.</i>

1544
01:44:14,546 --> 01:44:15,923
And what happens if I stay?

1545
01:44:16,507 --> 01:44:17,508
[Max] <i>You work for me.</i>

1546
01:44:18,133 --> 01:44:19,134
[Sandra] <i>Is this real?</i>

1547
01:44:20,010 --> 01:44:20,886
[Tom] <i>This is real.</i>

1548
01:44:21,512 --> 01:44:22,846
How can I be sure?

1549
01:44:24,056 --> 01:44:25,557
[Sandra] <i>I really like you.</i>

1550
01:44:26,517 --> 01:44:27,976
[Tom] <i>I really like you too.</i>

1551
01:44:28,977 --> 01:44:30,896
[Sandra sighs] <i>It's my brother.
He needs money.</i>

1552
01:44:30,979 --> 01:44:33,273
- Jason. Keep your voice...
- Listen. Yo, listen to me for two seconds!

1553
01:44:33,357 --> 01:44:35,692
I live with my dad and his new wife.

1554
01:44:36,902 --> 01:44:38,278
He thinks I'm a disappointment.

1555
01:44:40,155 --> 01:44:41,740
[Sandra] <i>But you're not a disappointment.</i>

1556
01:44:43,992 --> 01:44:44,826
[Tom] <i>I love you.</i>

1557
01:44:47,996 --> 01:44:49,915
[Max] <i>You can't cheat
an honest man, right?</i>

1558
01:44:50,916 --> 01:44:52,793
<i>That's why we never feel sorry
for the mark.</i>

1559
01:44:57,464 --> 01:44:59,132
[Sandra] <i>Max told me the whole score.</i>

1560
01:45:00,968 --> 01:45:04,847
<i>There was an old man who was dying
and was gonna leave behind a fortune.</i>

1561
01:45:07,724 --> 01:45:09,768
<i>We just needed to nudge aside the son</i>

1562
01:45:09,852 --> 01:45:14,064
<i>so that his very full of shit widow
could inherit it all.</i>

1563
01:45:23,782 --> 01:45:24,867
<i>I wanna confess.</i>

1564
01:45:28,787 --> 01:45:29,913
<i>Confess to it all.</i>

1565
01:45:36,003 --> 01:45:37,504
<i>I'm so sorry for all of this.</i>

1566
01:45:41,300 --> 01:45:42,301
How you doing, Tipsy?

1567
01:45:47,306 --> 01:45:49,558
Richard's dead
and Madeline got all the money.

1568
01:45:49,641 --> 01:45:52,186
[Braddock] <i>What she pulled
required a great deal of sophistication.</i>

1569
01:45:52,269 --> 01:45:54,021
<i>I don't see how this woman did it alone.</i>

1570
01:45:54,104 --> 01:45:55,397
<i>I think we're looking
for more than one person.</i>

1571
01:45:55,480 --> 01:45:56,732
There's a white dude named Goldie.

1572
01:45:56,815 --> 01:45:59,693
We like to call him Goldie
'cause he got... he got, like red hair.

1573
01:46:03,780 --> 01:46:05,490
[Braddock]
We have to take this out of here.

1574
01:46:05,574 --> 01:46:06,658
[Tom] <i>Yeah, you were right.</i>

1575
01:46:08,118 --> 01:46:11,205
<i>There was... There was this guy
who was her accomplice.</i>

1576
01:46:12,497 --> 01:46:16,418
<i>He taught her everything and trained her.
He planned the whole thing.</i>

1577
01:46:18,295 --> 01:46:19,421
[Tipsy] No. One more time.

1578
01:46:19,922 --> 01:46:22,883
[Tom] <i>He cheated her too.
He left her with nothing.</i>

1579
01:46:35,354 --> 01:46:36,647
[Sandra] <i>How can you do what you do?</i>

1580
01:46:39,733 --> 01:46:40,776
[Madeline] <i>Practice.</i>

1581
01:47:55,684 --> 01:47:58,353
- [shopkeeper bell jingles]
- Hey, excuse me, I got a quick question.

1582
01:47:58,437 --> 01:48:00,063
- I need to know where the fuck…
- [laughs]

1583
01:48:00,147 --> 01:48:03,233
- …is my money? [grunts] Look at y'all.
- There he is.

1584
01:48:03,901 --> 01:48:06,028
- Look like undercover cops. What's up?
- What's up, baby?

1585
01:48:06,111 --> 01:48:07,362
- How you doing?
- Here's your money.

1586
01:48:07,446 --> 01:48:12,034
Oh, okay. Not bad, Sandy.
Max taught you well, I see.

1587
01:48:12,117 --> 01:48:15,704
All right, last chance, huh?
I really could use someone like you.

1588
01:48:15,787 --> 01:48:17,289
Sorry, Goldie. I'm done.

1589
01:48:17,372 --> 01:48:19,875
- Yeah, whatever. I heard that one before.
- I'm done.

1590
01:48:19,958 --> 01:48:21,877
- [Braddock] All right. We gotta bounce.
- [Sandra] Yeah.

1591
01:48:21,960 --> 01:48:23,295
- [Braddock] See you guys later.
- [Tipsy] Peace.

1592
01:48:23,378 --> 01:48:24,588
- Take it easy.
- Gonna invest in some real estate, baby.

1593
01:48:24,671 --> 01:48:26,673
- Let's get it! [laughs]
- Yep!

1594
01:48:26,757 --> 01:48:27,841
[chattering indistinctly]

1595
01:48:29,426 --> 01:48:30,427
Bye, Sandy.

1596
01:48:38,393 --> 01:48:39,394
[shopkeeper bell jingles]

1597
01:48:41,271 --> 01:48:43,524
[sighs]

1598
01:48:43,607 --> 01:48:45,442
You got a lot of money, Tom. [sighs]

1599
01:48:46,610 --> 01:48:48,028
I hope you can do some good with it.

1600
01:48:49,947 --> 01:48:50,948
I will.

1601
01:48:52,282 --> 01:48:54,243
- Thank you.
- You're thanking me?

1602
01:48:54,326 --> 01:48:55,786
I got everything taken from you.

1603
01:48:58,205 --> 01:48:59,498
You also got it back.

1604
01:49:15,389 --> 01:49:18,517
So, there's this great little
Japanese restaurant on Mott Street.

1605
01:49:20,352 --> 01:49:22,020
If you're not doing anything,
dinner's on me.

1606
01:49:29,152 --> 01:49:30,404
Well, I am single.

1607
01:49:31,280 --> 01:49:33,782
- [chuckles]
- And, uh, I kinda like being single.

1608
01:49:33,866 --> 01:49:34,867
Mmm.

1609
01:49:36,994 --> 01:49:37,995
[bottle thuds softly]

1610
01:49:38,078 --> 01:49:41,081
