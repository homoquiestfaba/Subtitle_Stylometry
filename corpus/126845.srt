1
00:01:52,849 --> 00:01:54,965
<i>E instein was then celebrating...</i>

2
00:01:55,169 --> 00:01:57,967
<i>... the 7 0th birthday anniversary...</i>

3
00:01:58,169 --> 00:02:01,206
<i>...and there was a colloquium</i>
<i>given for him.</i>

4
00:02:01,449 --> 00:02:03,758
<i>And he said.:</i>

5
00:02:04,569 --> 00:02:08,608
<i>''God doesn't play dice</i>
<i>with the universe. ''</i>

6
00:02:08,809 --> 00:02:11,403
No, he just plays hide-and-seek.

7
00:02:11,609 --> 00:02:15,158
<i>Learn to write screenplays,</i>
<i>television scripts, plays--</i>

8
00:02:15,369 --> 00:02:17,325
Jesus, they<i>'</i>re so full of it.

9
00:02:17,529 --> 00:02:20,566
You can<i>'</i>t teach writing.
You expose students...

10
00:02:20,769 --> 00:02:23,966
...to good work and hope
it inspires them.

11
00:02:24,169 --> 00:02:27,559
Some can write,
others will never learn.

12
00:02:27,769 --> 00:02:31,159
You lose patience
if the student isn<i>'</i>t Dostoyevsky.

13
00:02:31,409 --> 00:02:33,969
No, that isn<i>'</i>t true. That<i>'</i>s crazy.

14
00:02:34,209 --> 00:02:37,201
lt<i>'</i>s worth it when you get
a gifted pupil.

15
00:02:37,409 --> 00:02:40,003
A girl in my class
wrote a great story:

16
00:02:40,249 --> 00:02:42,968
<i>''</i>Oral Sex in the Age of
Deconstruction.<i>''</i>

17
00:02:43,169 --> 00:02:46,002
-lt<i>'</i>s full of insight, romantic--
-They<i>'</i>re here.

18
00:02:46,249 --> 00:02:48,968
Jack will wanna take us
for Chinese food again.

19
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:51,967
l think Sally<i>'</i>s tired
of our pasta places.

20
00:02:52,209 --> 00:02:54,325
-Hi.
-ls it supposed to rain?

21
00:02:54,529 --> 00:02:55,564
Hi.

22
00:02:57,809 --> 00:03:00,004
Let me take your coat.

23
00:03:00,209 --> 00:03:03,007
l opened some white wine.
You want some?

24
00:03:03,249 --> 00:03:05,763
They<i>'</i>re doing something at 80th.

25
00:03:05,969 --> 00:03:09,200
Jack? You want some cold white wine?

26
00:03:09,449 --> 00:03:12,009
When l go to your place, it<i>'</i>s murder.

27
00:03:12,249 --> 00:03:16,208
So, Chinese, right? l can<i>'</i>t
talk you into ltalian?

28
00:03:16,449 --> 00:03:19,441
Listen, don<i>'</i>t get crazy, you know?

29
00:03:19,849 --> 00:03:23,762
Before we go out to dinner
we wanna tell you something.

30
00:03:25,249 --> 00:03:26,807
-You want to?
-Go ahead.

31
00:03:27,009 --> 00:03:29,842
-What? What?
-Somebody tell us.

32
00:03:30,449 --> 00:03:32,485
Jack and l are splitting up.

33
00:03:32,729 --> 00:03:35,402
Oh, l see. lt<i>'</i>s just--
Nothing serious.

34
00:03:35,649 --> 00:03:40,803
We discussed this for a long time
and we both think it<i>'</i>s for the best.

35
00:03:41,049 --> 00:03:42,960
You are joking, of course.

36
00:03:43,169 --> 00:03:45,808
Don<i>'</i>t make a big deal, okay?
We<i>'</i>re fine.

37
00:03:46,049 --> 00:03:49,121
-Are you serious?
-We are. We<i>'</i>re fine.

38
00:03:49,329 --> 00:03:53,004
-We both-- We discussed it.
-lt<i>'</i>s mutual.

39
00:03:53,209 --> 00:03:54,927
What do you mean?

40
00:03:55,129 --> 00:03:58,405
Let<i>'</i>s go talk about this at dinner.

41
00:03:58,649 --> 00:04:00,605
l<i>'</i>m not going out to dinner.

42
00:04:00,849 --> 00:04:05,604
Since when has this been decided?
What are we talking about here?

43
00:04:05,849 --> 00:04:07,601
We<i>'</i>ve been discussing it.

44
00:04:07,849 --> 00:04:10,409
Don<i>'</i>t be worried.
There<i>'</i>s no hostility.

45
00:04:10,609 --> 00:04:12,201
You see? We<i>'</i>re fine.

46
00:04:12,409 --> 00:04:14,604
-What is the reason?
-Don<i>'</i>t--

47
00:04:14,809 --> 00:04:17,369
Gabe, it<i>'</i>s none of our business.

48
00:04:17,569 --> 00:04:21,198
Don<i>'</i>t turn this into a tragedy.
lt<i>'</i>s a positive thing.

49
00:04:21,449 --> 00:04:23,804
How can you break up? lt<i>'</i>s insane.

50
00:04:24,049 --> 00:04:26,609
You<i>'</i>re Jack and Sally.
You got two kids.

51
00:04:26,809 --> 00:04:29,607
Our kids are grown up.
They<i>'</i>re in college.

52
00:04:29,849 --> 00:04:31,885
We won<i>'</i>t bore you with details.

53
00:04:32,129 --> 00:04:36,964
l can<i>'</i>t get my mind around this.
Since when? You get along so well.

54
00:04:37,169 --> 00:04:40,605
She<i>'</i>s right.
Have you met other people?

55
00:04:40,849 --> 00:04:42,646
Gabe, it<i>'</i>s not our business.

56
00:04:42,889 --> 00:04:45,198
-l<i>'</i>m fascinated by this.
-l feel sick.

57
00:04:45,449 --> 00:04:47,758
We didn<i>'</i>t wanna ruin anything.

58
00:04:47,969 --> 00:04:52,326
-We wanna see what it<i>'</i>s like to be--
-Apart for a while.

59
00:04:52,529 --> 00:04:55,566
Don<i>'</i>t not support us.
We<i>'</i>ve gotten the nerve--

60
00:04:55,769 --> 00:04:58,567
This is insanity.
You<i>'</i>ll be back together--

61
00:04:58,809 --> 00:05:03,724
She<i>'</i>s keeping the place in Riverdale.
l<i>'</i>m looking for a place in town.

62
00:05:03,929 --> 00:05:05,806
l just feel shattered.

63
00:05:06,009 --> 00:05:08,682
-Oh, come on, Judy.
-l do.

64
00:05:08,889 --> 00:05:10,163
Come on, let<i>'</i>s eat.

65
00:05:10,369 --> 00:05:13,202
What do you mean,
<i>''</i> Come on, let<i>'</i>s eat<i>''</i>?

66
00:05:13,409 --> 00:05:15,525
<i>''</i> Come on<i>''</i>? l can<i>'</i>t eat.

67
00:05:15,729 --> 00:05:17,401
-Don<i>'</i>t get angry.
-l<i>'</i>m not!

68
00:05:17,649 --> 00:05:19,401
-l<i>'</i>m not angry!
-l knew it.

69
00:05:19,649 --> 00:05:23,403
You march in here and announce
you<i>'</i>re breaking up?

70
00:05:23,609 --> 00:05:26,487
You have two kids!
Why are you doing this?

71
00:05:26,729 --> 00:05:28,799
This is not our business.

72
00:05:29,049 --> 00:05:31,768
Why not? They<i>'</i>re our
closest friends!

73
00:05:31,969 --> 00:05:35,086
There is no one traumatic event.

74
00:05:35,329 --> 00:05:40,005
People grow apart. lt<i>'</i>s a lot of
little personal things. Now stop it.

75
00:05:40,249 --> 00:05:42,717
l don<i>'</i>t wanna hear this bullshit.

76
00:05:42,929 --> 00:05:44,806
-Why is she so upset?
-Judy--

77
00:05:45,049 --> 00:05:46,482
She cares about us.

78
00:05:46,689 --> 00:05:48,486
Well, l care about you too.

79
00:05:48,729 --> 00:05:50,401
-We<i>'</i>re fine, okay?
-Judy!

80
00:05:50,649 --> 00:05:53,482
-We wanna do this.
-This is crazy.

81
00:05:53,729 --> 00:05:56,607
Why are you taking
this so personally?

82
00:05:56,849 --> 00:05:59,807
l<i>'</i>m upset! All right?
Can<i>'</i>t l be upset?

83
00:06:00,049 --> 00:06:02,404
l<i>'</i>ve discussed this in therapy.

84
00:06:02,649 --> 00:06:05,368
You have? You never said a word!

85
00:06:05,569 --> 00:06:10,165
-You said this wasn<i>'</i>t our business.
-We were all so close!

86
00:06:10,369 --> 00:06:11,802
l assumed we were.

87
00:06:12,049 --> 00:06:13,402
She<i>'</i>s very upset.

88
00:06:13,649 --> 00:06:16,402
Will you please not
turn this into a wake?

89
00:06:16,609 --> 00:06:21,000
Why is this such a personal thing
for you? l don<i>'</i>t know what to say.

90
00:06:21,209 --> 00:06:24,007
Let<i>'</i>s just go out to dinner
and forget it.

91
00:06:24,249 --> 00:06:28,128
-Judy, come on!
-l knew this would happen.

92
00:06:28,929 --> 00:06:30,601
So why were you so upset?

93
00:06:30,809 --> 00:06:33,198
l don<i>'</i>t know. l really don<i>'</i>t know.

94
00:06:33,449 --> 00:06:36,566
-lt was a total shock?
-Yeah, completely.

95
00:06:36,769 --> 00:06:39,044
They were so casual about it.

96
00:06:39,249 --> 00:06:42,400
They didn<i>'</i>t seem to be
appropriately upset.

97
00:06:42,649 --> 00:06:46,801
Were you hurt because Sally never
mentioned anything to you?

98
00:06:47,049 --> 00:06:48,198
Well....

99
00:06:48,449 --> 00:06:51,805
l think, if l look hard--
Searching over the time...

100
00:06:52,049 --> 00:06:54,563
...when we were alone together--

101
00:06:54,769 --> 00:06:58,284
She may have occasionally
remarked about wondering...

102
00:06:58,529 --> 00:07:01,327
...what it would be like
to be single.

103
00:07:01,529 --> 00:07:06,205
Now, with all she knew, all she<i>'</i>d
experienced. That kind of thing.

104
00:07:06,449 --> 00:07:09,805
But she never said anything
negative about Jack.

105
00:07:10,009 --> 00:07:13,604
Before we go on, tell us
something about yourself.

106
00:07:13,849 --> 00:07:15,805
So we know who you are.

107
00:07:16,009 --> 00:07:19,718
Okay. My name is Judy Roth.
l<i>'</i>m married to Gabe.

108
00:07:19,929 --> 00:07:22,318
We<i>'</i>ve been married about 1 0 years.

109
00:07:22,529 --> 00:07:26,408
l work for an art magazine.
We don<i>'</i>t have any children.

110
00:07:26,609 --> 00:07:29,407
l have a daughter
from a previous marriage.

111
00:07:29,609 --> 00:07:34,125
l was married when l was very young,
to an architect.

112
00:07:34,329 --> 00:07:37,207
lt didn<i>'</i>t work out.
lt<i>'</i>s nobody<i>'</i>s fault.

113
00:07:37,849 --> 00:07:40,807
<i>Judy told us they did</i>
<i>finally go to dinner.</i>

114
00:07:41,049 --> 00:07:45,600
<i>She said she was tense and nervous,</i>
<i>although the others seemed fine.</i>

115
00:07:45,809 --> 00:07:47,720
<i>Afterwards, they walked home.</i>

116
00:07:47,929 --> 00:07:52,207
<i>She tried to participate,</i>
<i>but found the atmosphere strained.</i>

117
00:07:52,409 --> 00:07:56,243
<i>All in all, she said,</i>
<i>it was a very peculiar evening.</i>

118
00:07:58,209 --> 00:07:59,801
lt<i>'</i>s amazing, isn<i>'</i>t it?

119
00:08:00,049 --> 00:08:03,598
You think you<i>'</i>re friendly
with people and it turns out...

120
00:08:03,809 --> 00:08:07,165
...you really have no idea
what they<i>'</i>re thinking.

121
00:08:09,249 --> 00:08:11,968
Do you ever hide things from me?

122
00:08:12,369 --> 00:08:15,167
Me? What kind of things?

123
00:08:15,369 --> 00:08:17,963
l don<i>'</i>t know. Feelings, you know.

124
00:08:18,169 --> 00:08:20,967
Longings. Complaints.

125
00:08:22,129 --> 00:08:23,323
No.

126
00:08:24,529 --> 00:08:26,759
-Do you?
-No.

127
00:08:28,529 --> 00:08:30,759
Sometimes, maybe.

128
00:08:31,169 --> 00:08:33,000
Really? Like what?

129
00:08:33,249 --> 00:08:37,208
l don<i>'</i>t know. You know how
you<i>'</i>re always so critical?

130
00:08:37,449 --> 00:08:39,405
We<i>'</i>ve had this conversation.

131
00:08:39,609 --> 00:08:42,806
You<i>'</i>re definitely in a strange
mood tonight.

132
00:08:43,049 --> 00:08:45,404
l<i>'</i>m fine. l<i>'</i>m sorry.

133
00:08:45,649 --> 00:08:50,359
Jack never gave you an inkling?
lt<i>'</i>s strange, you guys are so close.

134
00:08:50,569 --> 00:08:54,198
l remember one incident
he mentioned at his office.

135
00:08:54,409 --> 00:08:56,445
Jack, trust me on this.

136
00:08:56,689 --> 00:08:58,566
This girl is to die.

137
00:08:58,769 --> 00:09:01,966
Shawn Grainger, she<i>'</i>s built
out to here.

138
00:09:02,169 --> 00:09:04,888
You will have the time of your life.

139
00:09:05,089 --> 00:09:08,126
And for $200, believe me,
it<i>'</i>s a bargain.

140
00:09:08,329 --> 00:09:10,763
l<i>'</i>m not gonna do it.
What about AlDS?

141
00:09:11,009 --> 00:09:14,445
She<i>'</i>s not a whore.
She<i>'</i>s a high-class call girl.

142
00:09:14,689 --> 00:09:19,160
She<i>'</i>ll do anything you want.
And on top of it, she<i>'</i>s got friends.

143
00:09:19,369 --> 00:09:21,929
What about my wife? lt<i>'</i>s dangerous.

144
00:09:22,129 --> 00:09:24,359
Who was the guy who told me...

145
00:09:24,569 --> 00:09:27,367
...that your sex life
wasn<i>'</i>t so terrific?

146
00:09:27,609 --> 00:09:31,284
Come on, at a two-martini
lunch l<i>'</i>ll say anything.

147
00:09:31,529 --> 00:09:35,204
Shawn has got a mouth
like velvet. Believe me.

148
00:09:35,449 --> 00:09:38,964
She was a former
Miss Something-or-Other.

149
00:09:39,169 --> 00:09:41,603
What exactly did l say at lunch?

150
00:09:41,809 --> 00:09:45,199
You said that Sally was cold,
and you were...

151
00:09:45,409 --> 00:09:48,481
...dying to fuck
your aerobics trainer.

152
00:09:48,689 --> 00:09:50,759
l should never drink at lunch.

153
00:09:51,009 --> 00:09:53,398
l<i>'</i>m gonna write down the number.

154
00:09:53,649 --> 00:09:56,402
-l advise you to--
-What are you doing?

155
00:09:56,649 --> 00:09:57,684
Hey. What--?

156
00:09:57,889 --> 00:09:59,766
Have l steered you wrong?

157
00:09:59,969 --> 00:10:01,721
-l<i>'</i>ve never--
-Get out of here.

158
00:10:01,929 --> 00:10:04,159
There it is. Use it.

159
00:10:12,369 --> 00:10:16,965
He called. l thought it was about
a month after he got my number.

160
00:10:17,169 --> 00:10:19,967
He was polite on the phone.
A little tense.

161
00:10:20,169 --> 00:10:23,400
l can always tell who<i>'</i>s inexperienced.

162
00:10:23,609 --> 00:10:26,760
He wanted to meet
at the Americana Hotel.

163
00:10:26,969 --> 00:10:31,838
When l got there he was very polite,
very gentlemanly. Very nervous.

164
00:10:32,729 --> 00:10:36,768
He couldn<i>'</i>t go through with it.
He couldn<i>'</i>t get it up.

165
00:10:37,929 --> 00:10:41,205
He had pains in his chest.
l thought it was...

166
00:10:41,449 --> 00:10:44,327
...a heart attack, but they passed.

167
00:10:44,529 --> 00:10:48,602
-That was the last you saw of him?
-He called a month later.

168
00:10:48,849 --> 00:10:52,364
We met at the same hotel.
This time we had sex.

169
00:10:52,569 --> 00:10:57,199
Then l started seeing him fairly
regularly, every two, three weeks.

170
00:10:57,449 --> 00:11:01,408
He said he<i>'</i>d seen a psychiatrist
and worked out his problem.

171
00:11:01,649 --> 00:11:04,607
Once l couldn<i>'</i>t make it
so l sent a friend.

172
00:11:04,809 --> 00:11:07,323
Then he started seeing both of us.

173
00:11:07,529 --> 00:11:10,999
Then neither one of us
ever saw him again.

174
00:11:11,209 --> 00:11:15,805
-At least he threw the number away.
-Well, as far as l know.

175
00:11:16,049 --> 00:11:17,960
But Jack is not a hooker guy.

176
00:11:18,169 --> 00:11:19,807
He<i>'</i>s very strait-laced.

177
00:11:20,049 --> 00:11:22,005
And Sally<i>'</i>s cold in bed.

178
00:11:22,209 --> 00:11:25,406
That<i>'</i>s no surprise.
She<i>'</i>s very cerebral.

179
00:11:25,649 --> 00:11:27,321
Am l cold in bed?

180
00:11:27,529 --> 00:11:29,406
No. Why would you say that?

181
00:11:29,649 --> 00:11:32,607
But l<i>'</i>m inhibited, right?
You said that.

182
00:11:32,849 --> 00:11:37,400
You can<i>'</i>t forget that.
We had one minor argument years ago.

183
00:11:37,649 --> 00:11:41,005
Which you blew up into
a major confrontation--

184
00:11:41,249 --> 00:11:43,968
Do you ever want to sleep
with a whore?

185
00:11:44,169 --> 00:11:46,160
Me? No, definitely not.

186
00:11:46,369 --> 00:11:48,360
When l was in college, l did.

187
00:11:48,569 --> 00:11:49,604
Yeah?

188
00:11:49,849 --> 00:11:54,798
You<i>'</i>re in an odd mood. Their breakup
has definitely affected you.

189
00:11:55,049 --> 00:11:56,402
You think--

190
00:11:56,609 --> 00:11:59,169
You think we<i>'</i>d ever break up?

191
00:11:59,409 --> 00:12:02,401
What? l<i>'</i>m not planning it, are you?

192
00:12:02,649 --> 00:12:04,765
-No.
-Okay.

193
00:12:05,209 --> 00:12:10,966
But l don<i>'</i>t know how l<i>'</i>ll feel if you
still don<i>'</i>t wanna make me pregnant.

194
00:12:11,329 --> 00:12:14,401
Are we gonna have that
conversation again?

195
00:12:14,649 --> 00:12:17,004
-You have a daughter--
-Yeah.

196
00:12:17,209 --> 00:12:19,245
l want another.

197
00:12:19,489 --> 00:12:20,604
Why?

198
00:12:20,809 --> 00:12:25,007
lt<i>'</i>s cruel to bring life
into this terrible world.

199
00:12:25,249 --> 00:12:28,764
Don<i>'</i>t glorify your refusal
on philosophical grounds.

200
00:12:28,969 --> 00:12:33,201
You should see the angry look
on your face when you say that.

201
00:12:33,649 --> 00:12:35,765
You wanna make love?

202
00:12:37,449 --> 00:12:41,203
Okay, if we can get
into it in some way.

203
00:12:41,449 --> 00:12:45,806
-l can<i>'</i>t just do it on command.
-We can get into it.

204
00:12:46,049 --> 00:12:49,166
Okay, so put your diaphragm on.

205
00:12:53,569 --> 00:12:57,357
You<i>'</i>d never say you were
putting your diaphragm on...

206
00:12:57,569 --> 00:12:59,525
...and then not do it, right?

207
00:12:59,729 --> 00:13:01,162
What?

208
00:13:01,929 --> 00:13:03,601
What a thing to say!

209
00:13:03,849 --> 00:13:05,999
That<i>'</i>s a terrible thing to say.

210
00:13:06,209 --> 00:13:10,760
You really trust no one. No wonder
people accuse you of cynicism.

211
00:13:11,009 --> 00:13:12,761
-Okay. l apologize.
-Jesus!

212
00:13:12,969 --> 00:13:16,166
-l<i>'</i>m tired. lt<i>'</i>s 1 a.m.
-We don<i>'</i>t have to do it.

213
00:13:16,409 --> 00:13:20,004
-Are you still attracted to me?
-Yes, l am.

214
00:13:20,249 --> 00:13:22,001
-Truly?
-Of course.

215
00:13:22,249 --> 00:13:26,686
-We do it less and less.
-Our schedules are not exactly--

216
00:13:26,929 --> 00:13:29,568
When we wanted to, we found time.

217
00:13:29,769 --> 00:13:32,920
-Come here.
-Parties, people<i>'</i>s bathrooms--

218
00:13:33,129 --> 00:13:35,802
Sit and relax for a minute, will you?

219
00:13:36,049 --> 00:13:40,998
lf you remember clearly, when we
used to do that spontaneous sex...

220
00:13:41,249 --> 00:13:44,559
...you never really liked it.
You were always tense.

221
00:13:44,769 --> 00:13:48,603
You always heard people
in the next room making noises.

222
00:13:48,849 --> 00:13:52,000
Now you remember it
in a glorified way.

223
00:13:52,209 --> 00:13:55,599
-Are you ever attracted to other women?
-Like who?

224
00:13:55,809 --> 00:14:00,963
Like all the women you have in class,
who are so talented and insightful.

225
00:14:01,169 --> 00:14:03,160
l<i>'</i>m sure they worship you.

226
00:14:03,369 --> 00:14:07,920
Can l tell you that they don<i>'</i>t
want an old man? All right?

227
00:14:08,129 --> 00:14:12,168
l think an old man does better
than an old woman.

228
00:14:12,369 --> 00:14:15,725
Then we<i>'</i>re definitely
stuck with one another.

229
00:14:15,929 --> 00:14:17,965
Now, come on. You<i>'</i>re really....

230
00:14:18,929 --> 00:14:20,362
Come on.

231
00:14:25,369 --> 00:14:28,202
<i>Some time later,</i>
<i>Sally had a date with Paul...</i>

232
00:14:28,449 --> 00:14:31,759
<i>...a colleague at work</i>
<i>who had always liked her.</i>

233
00:14:54,249 --> 00:14:56,809
-Sally. Come in.
-Thank you very much.

234
00:14:57,049 --> 00:14:59,802
Come into my rent-stabilized den.

235
00:15:00,049 --> 00:15:02,609
-Can l take your coat?
-lt<i>'</i>s lovely.

236
00:15:02,809 --> 00:15:05,403
l love it. Thank you.

237
00:15:05,609 --> 00:15:08,726
l thought we<i>'</i>d have a drink.

238
00:15:08,929 --> 00:15:12,001
l was able to get tickets
to <i>Don Giovanni.</i>

239
00:15:12,209 --> 00:15:15,406
-Great.
-You all right?

240
00:15:15,609 --> 00:15:18,567
-What would you like?
-Anything. White wine?

241
00:15:18,769 --> 00:15:20,168
White wine.

242
00:15:27,569 --> 00:15:31,403
l hear the staging of this opera
is not to be believed.

243
00:15:31,649 --> 00:15:33,958
Oh, really? How fabulous.

244
00:15:35,849 --> 00:15:37,362
That<i>'</i>s lovely.

245
00:15:37,649 --> 00:15:41,164
Oh, hey, don<i>'</i>t worry about it.
l<i>'</i>ll get it later.

246
00:15:41,369 --> 00:15:44,918
-Can l use the phone?
-Yeah, sure. You all right?

247
00:15:45,129 --> 00:15:47,597
-l<i>'</i>m looking forward to it.
-This way.

248
00:15:47,809 --> 00:15:50,767
A good friend of mine did the sets.

249
00:15:52,809 --> 00:15:57,166
lt<i>'</i>s me. You are living with her,
aren<i>'</i>t you? You<i>'</i>ve moved in together.

250
00:15:58,249 --> 00:16:00,809
Don<i>'</i>t lie to me, Jack. You are.

251
00:16:01,049 --> 00:16:02,198
Because l know.

252
00:16:02,449 --> 00:16:03,598
Because l do.

253
00:16:03,849 --> 00:16:06,158
Yes, l heard.

254
00:16:07,249 --> 00:16:09,444
lt<i>'</i>s been three fucking weeks!

255
00:16:09,689 --> 00:16:12,362
How did you meet someone so fast?

256
00:16:12,649 --> 00:16:15,800
Bullshit. You had to have
known her before.

257
00:16:16,009 --> 00:16:19,365
Bullshit! Don<i>'</i>t give me that shit!

258
00:16:19,969 --> 00:16:22,529
Oh, you<i>'</i>re in love?

259
00:16:22,729 --> 00:16:25,163
So fast?

260
00:16:27,049 --> 00:16:29,040
l don<i>'</i>t fucking believe it!

261
00:16:29,449 --> 00:16:34,364
You were seeing whoever it is
all along.

262
00:16:34,889 --> 00:16:39,007
Of course, l expected things
to happen. But not so fast!

263
00:16:39,249 --> 00:16:41,558
Are you that sure?

264
00:16:43,409 --> 00:16:45,559
No, l<i>'</i>m not.

265
00:16:46,449 --> 00:16:50,203
Oh, God, it<i>'</i>s just fucking
dishonest bullshit!

266
00:16:55,769 --> 00:16:57,964
Hi, you--?

267
00:16:59,129 --> 00:17:00,164
l<i>'</i>m fine.

268
00:17:00,409 --> 00:17:04,527
-lf you<i>'</i>re having a personal--
-Really. l<i>'</i>m okay.

269
00:17:04,729 --> 00:17:07,801
l<i>'</i>m looking forward to tonight.
What are we seeing?

270
00:17:08,049 --> 00:17:09,801
<i>Don Giovanni.</i>

271
00:17:10,009 --> 00:17:11,761
A Don Juan story.

272
00:17:12,449 --> 00:17:15,168
l can only think of it as Mozart.

273
00:17:15,369 --> 00:17:17,166
Fucking Don Juans.

274
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:21,362
They should have cut his
fucking dick off.

275
00:17:23,009 --> 00:17:25,762
Can l get you some more wine?

276
00:17:25,969 --> 00:17:27,527
Please.

277
00:17:31,009 --> 00:17:33,079
You know, we don<i>'</i>t have to go.

278
00:17:33,289 --> 00:17:37,407
No. l<i>'</i>m not gonna
put my life on hold.

279
00:17:37,649 --> 00:17:40,641
l<i>'</i>ve been dying to see this opera.

280
00:17:40,889 --> 00:17:43,562
-Excuse me one second.
-Sure.

281
00:17:43,849 --> 00:17:45,521
Hello. Me again.

282
00:17:45,729 --> 00:17:47,003
l know who she is.

283
00:17:47,249 --> 00:17:49,524
Bullshit! lt<i>'</i>s Gail.

284
00:17:49,729 --> 00:17:55,008
She<i>'</i>s been after you since she joined
the firm. You both like sports!

285
00:17:55,209 --> 00:17:57,165
Don<i>'</i>t lie to me, Jack.

286
00:17:57,369 --> 00:18:00,122
She<i>'</i>s your type.
She<i>'</i>s got that look.

287
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:04,402
She<i>'</i>s bright and all that
Princeton bullshit! No!

288
00:18:04,649 --> 00:18:09,769
l thought it was an experiment!
l didn<i>'</i>t think it was final.

289
00:18:10,009 --> 00:18:12,762
l didn<i>'</i>t realize you were
having an affair!

290
00:18:13,369 --> 00:18:17,726
That<i>'</i>s bullshit! l don<i>'</i>t
buy a fucking word of it!

291
00:18:19,769 --> 00:18:22,761
-What time do we have to be there?
-Listen...

292
00:18:22,969 --> 00:18:27,759
...l don<i>'</i>t really think l can
do this. l<i>'</i>m feeling upset.

293
00:18:28,129 --> 00:18:31,405
What are you upset about? Fucking men!

294
00:18:31,649 --> 00:18:35,119
A woman gets to this age,
it<i>'</i>s a different ball game.

295
00:18:35,329 --> 00:18:39,368
Don<i>'</i>t defend your sex! lt<i>'</i>s true!

296
00:18:39,969 --> 00:18:45,168
lt<i>'</i>s great till you start to show your
age, then they want a newer model.

297
00:18:45,369 --> 00:18:46,802
Sally.

298
00:18:47,049 --> 00:18:49,199
Sally, you<i>'</i>re--

299
00:18:49,449 --> 00:18:54,318
You<i>'</i>re a very attractive woman,
for any age.

300
00:18:54,809 --> 00:18:58,961
lt was a terrible blow to my ego.
l thought he loved me.

301
00:18:59,169 --> 00:19:01,399
That we were experimenting.

302
00:19:01,609 --> 00:19:04,362
But if you had met someone first...?

303
00:19:05,729 --> 00:19:07,401
Probably right.

304
00:19:07,649 --> 00:19:10,561
Probably would<i>'</i>ve done
the same thing.

305
00:19:11,049 --> 00:19:15,122
l had fantasized about
being single many times.

306
00:19:17,289 --> 00:19:20,406
lt<i>'</i>s hard to keep a marriage
going smoothly.

307
00:19:20,649 --> 00:19:25,120
All the frustration and baggage.
l don<i>'</i>t know.

308
00:19:25,329 --> 00:19:26,762
l don<i>'</i>t know.

309
00:19:28,529 --> 00:19:31,680
Gail came to his office
the year before.

310
00:19:31,889 --> 00:19:33,800
l<i>'</i>d met her several times.

311
00:19:34,049 --> 00:19:36,404
Look, what can l say? She<i>'</i>s...

312
00:19:37,169 --> 00:19:39,444
...cultivated, intelligent.

313
00:19:39,649 --> 00:19:41,162
lt<i>'</i>s what he likes.

314
00:19:41,849 --> 00:19:45,159
She<i>'</i>d been over to the house
a few times.

315
00:19:45,369 --> 00:19:49,487
She loved my taste in everything.
She even dressed like me.

316
00:19:50,169 --> 00:19:53,764
What can l say?
She<i>'</i>s me, but she<i>'</i>s younger.

317
00:20:04,409 --> 00:20:09,358
Listen, your short story
was absolutely fabulous.

318
00:20:09,849 --> 00:20:10,964
-Really?
-Yeah.

319
00:20:11,169 --> 00:20:13,364
l was very impressed, l must say.

320
00:20:13,569 --> 00:20:16,208
lt was probably the best this term.

321
00:20:16,409 --> 00:20:18,604
-lt was wonderful.
-That<i>'</i>s great!

322
00:20:18,849 --> 00:20:22,603
The insights were great,
the prose was very graceful.

323
00:20:22,849 --> 00:20:25,966
You know, in general, l was impressed.

324
00:20:26,169 --> 00:20:29,206
-God, l<i>'</i>m blushing, right?
-Well, don<i>'</i>t--

325
00:20:29,409 --> 00:20:31,604
My face gets all red.

326
00:20:31,849 --> 00:20:33,965
l may just cry.

327
00:20:34,249 --> 00:20:38,800
Well, don<i>'</i>t take it that badly.
l meant it as a compliment.

328
00:20:39,049 --> 00:20:40,926
lt was great. Wonderful.

329
00:20:41,129 --> 00:20:44,166
Your approbation means
more than anybody<i>'</i>s.

330
00:20:44,369 --> 00:20:47,008
You<i>'</i>re the reason why
l wanted to write.

331
00:20:47,249 --> 00:20:49,160
-Really?
-Yeah.

332
00:20:49,769 --> 00:20:53,808
My family and l, we used to quote
<i>''</i>The Grey Hat.<i>''</i>

333
00:20:54,049 --> 00:20:56,517
How do you remember that story?

334
00:20:56,729 --> 00:20:58,640
<i>''</i>Giving up his hopes...

335
00:20:58,849 --> 00:21:03,001
...compromising one<i>'</i>s dreams,
is like putting on a grey hat.<i>''</i>

336
00:21:03,249 --> 00:21:04,807
l love that!

337
00:21:05,009 --> 00:21:07,523
You remember that. That<i>'</i>s great.

338
00:21:07,929 --> 00:21:10,602
Listen. You can hear my heart beating.

339
00:21:10,849 --> 00:21:12,999
How<i>'</i>d you get the name Rain?

340
00:21:13,249 --> 00:21:16,798
My parents named me after...

341
00:21:17,049 --> 00:21:18,118
...Rilke.

342
00:21:18,329 --> 00:21:22,208
-Did they?
-Yeah, it<i>'</i>s my mother<i>'</i>s favourite poet.

343
00:21:22,449 --> 00:21:24,201
So that<i>'</i>s how l got it.

344
00:21:24,449 --> 00:21:27,009
Are your folks, you know, writers?

345
00:21:27,209 --> 00:21:32,158
No, my dad<i>'</i>s an investment banker
and my mom works at Lincoln Center.

346
00:21:32,369 --> 00:21:35,361
Are you an only child?

347
00:21:35,569 --> 00:21:39,198
-Why are you asking these questions?
-l<i>'</i>m interested.

348
00:21:39,449 --> 00:21:41,167
l was so impressed.

349
00:21:41,409 --> 00:21:45,322
l gave it to someone else
and she was also impressed.

350
00:21:45,529 --> 00:21:46,803
Oh, really?

351
00:21:47,049 --> 00:21:50,962
-Are you from New York?
-l<i>'</i>m from East End Avenue.

352
00:21:51,169 --> 00:21:54,002
-Are these too many questions?
-No.

353
00:21:54,249 --> 00:21:59,528
lt<i>'</i>s just the only child one.
Yes, l was an only child. Yeah.

354
00:21:59,729 --> 00:22:03,199
So how did you manage
to write something so deep?

355
00:22:03,449 --> 00:22:05,167
l mean, have you had a--?

356
00:22:05,369 --> 00:22:07,963
Have you been married and divorced?

357
00:22:08,169 --> 00:22:11,525
ls your whole family stormy
and tempestuous or--?

358
00:22:11,729 --> 00:22:16,120
What? l didn<i>'</i>t know l was stormy
and tempestuous.

359
00:22:16,329 --> 00:22:18,718
Well, the writing was very--

360
00:22:18,929 --> 00:22:20,999
-lt was intense.
-l don<i>'</i>t know.

361
00:22:21,249 --> 00:22:25,003
lt<i>'</i>s just a trick, you know?
lt<i>'</i>s like...

362
00:22:25,249 --> 00:22:28,525
...when l was 1 0, l wrote
this story on Paris...

363
00:22:28,729 --> 00:22:30,799
...and l<i>'</i>d never been there.

364
00:22:31,049 --> 00:22:34,200
You don<i>'</i>t have to--
lt<i>'</i>s just a trick.

365
00:22:34,409 --> 00:22:38,448
-You don<i>'</i>t have to know or--
-Can you just turn it out?

366
00:22:47,529 --> 00:22:52,398
There are a number of very good
professors who are notorious...

367
00:22:52,609 --> 00:22:57,205
...for seducing their female pupils.
This goes on...

368
00:22:57,449 --> 00:23:00,009
...because it<i>'</i>s a cinch.

369
00:23:00,249 --> 00:23:02,638
You know, they look up to them.

370
00:23:02,849 --> 00:23:04,805
You know, they<i>'</i>re older men...

371
00:23:05,049 --> 00:23:08,325
...and students are flattered
by the attention.

372
00:23:08,529 --> 00:23:13,523
lt<i>'</i>s not something l<i>'</i>ve ever done.
Not to say l haven<i>'</i>t had daydreams.

373
00:23:13,729 --> 00:23:17,802
Some of those women are
very attractive and interesting.

374
00:23:18,009 --> 00:23:19,965
But l<i>'</i>ve never--

375
00:23:20,169 --> 00:23:21,807
l<i>'</i>ve never acted on it.

376
00:23:22,049 --> 00:23:24,609
l<i>'</i>ve never cheated on Judy.

377
00:23:24,809 --> 00:23:28,358
Or any other relationship
in my life, really.

378
00:23:28,569 --> 00:23:32,005
Because that has not been my style.

379
00:23:32,249 --> 00:23:33,762
But, once--

380
00:23:33,969 --> 00:23:35,800
One time, many years ago...

381
00:23:36,049 --> 00:23:39,928
...l was living with this fabulous,
interesting woman...

382
00:23:40,129 --> 00:23:41,721
...named Harriet Harmon.

383
00:23:41,929 --> 00:23:45,638
l<i>'</i>m ashamed to say this,
but Harriet Harmon...

384
00:23:45,849 --> 00:23:47,999
...was the great love of my life.

385
00:23:48,249 --> 00:23:53,004
lt was a very passionate relationship.
l loved her very intensely.

386
00:23:53,249 --> 00:23:57,003
And, you know, we just
made love everywhere.

387
00:23:57,249 --> 00:23:59,205
She was sexually carnivorous.

388
00:23:59,449 --> 00:24:02,122
We did it in stalled elevators...

389
00:24:02,329 --> 00:24:08,120
...and in bushes and people<i>'</i>s houses,
at parties in the bathroom.

390
00:24:08,329 --> 00:24:11,719
ln the back of cars, she<i>'</i>d
put a coat on our laps...

391
00:24:11,929 --> 00:24:15,478
...and grab my hand and
stick it between her legs.

392
00:24:15,689 --> 00:24:17,759
She was really something.

393
00:24:17,969 --> 00:24:22,963
And she, you know,
she was highly libidinous.

394
00:24:23,169 --> 00:24:27,208
You know? She wanted
to make love with other women.

395
00:24:27,449 --> 00:24:31,362
She got into dope for a while.
She<i>'</i>d break that thing...

396
00:24:31,569 --> 00:24:35,403
...that you sniff when she<i>'</i>d
have her orgasm.

397
00:24:35,649 --> 00:24:38,038
l was getting a real education.

398
00:24:38,249 --> 00:24:41,605
l was fascinated.
l was absolutely nuts about her.

399
00:24:41,809 --> 00:24:46,724
And ultimately she wound up
in an institution.

400
00:24:47,049 --> 00:24:50,928
l mean, it<i>'</i>s not funny,
it was a very sad thing.

401
00:24:51,129 --> 00:24:54,565
She was great, but nuts.

402
00:24:55,369 --> 00:24:58,566
See, l<i>'</i>ve always had this penchant...

403
00:24:58,769 --> 00:25:01,363
...for what l call <i>''</i> kamikaze women.<i>''</i>

404
00:25:01,569 --> 00:25:06,006
l call them kamikazes because
they crash their plane.

405
00:25:06,209 --> 00:25:09,406
They crash it into you,
and you die with them.

406
00:25:09,649 --> 00:25:13,562
As soon as there<i>'</i>s little chance
of it working out...

407
00:25:13,809 --> 00:25:18,200
...something clicks in my mind.
Maybe because l<i>'</i>m a writer.

408
00:25:18,449 --> 00:25:21,998
A dramatic or aesthetic component
becomes right...

409
00:25:22,209 --> 00:25:24,040
...and l go after that person.

410
00:25:24,289 --> 00:25:28,567
There<i>'</i>s a certain dramatic ambience
that<i>'</i>s almost...

411
00:25:28,769 --> 00:25:31,602
...as if l fall in love
with the situation.

412
00:25:31,809 --> 00:25:35,279
Of course, it has not
worked out well for me.

413
00:25:35,489 --> 00:25:37,844
lt has not been great and--

414
00:25:38,409 --> 00:25:41,367
<i>A few weeks after Jack</i>
<i>and Sally split--</i>

415
00:25:41,569 --> 00:25:44,003
<i>You know, he and I didn't speak much.</i>

416
00:25:44,249 --> 00:25:48,208
<i>I found him elusive.</i>
<i>We spent more time with Sally.</i>

417
00:25:48,449 --> 00:25:51,600
<i>She was depressed.</i>
<i>We'd try and cheer her up.</i>

418
00:25:51,849 --> 00:25:54,602
l<i>'</i>d be scared to live alone
where you live.

419
00:25:54,809 --> 00:25:56,800
lt<i>'</i>s really scary.

420
00:25:57,009 --> 00:26:00,365
There have been burglaries.
My neighbour was robbed.

421
00:26:00,569 --> 00:26:02,924
And nearby, people were at home.

422
00:26:03,129 --> 00:26:05,723
lt<i>'</i>s lucky for them
they didn<i>'</i>t wake up.

423
00:26:05,929 --> 00:26:09,808
l would die. l<i>'</i>d never
close my eyes at night.

424
00:26:10,049 --> 00:26:12,563
-You wanna get something to eat?
-Sure.

425
00:26:12,769 --> 00:26:13,963
Hey.

426
00:26:18,569 --> 00:26:19,763
-This is Sam.
-Hi.

427
00:26:19,969 --> 00:26:23,006
-This is Gabe and Sally.
-This is Judy.

428
00:26:23,249 --> 00:26:25,922
-l have to go. Sorry.
-Don<i>'</i>t be silly.

429
00:26:26,129 --> 00:26:28,006
No, l have an appointment.

430
00:26:28,249 --> 00:26:29,921
-Really?
-Don<i>'</i>t be crazy.

431
00:26:30,129 --> 00:26:32,199
-l have to go.
-We were gonna eat.

432
00:26:32,449 --> 00:26:33,643
l just wanted you--

433
00:26:39,169 --> 00:26:40,363
God!

434
00:26:51,729 --> 00:26:53,401
-Some coincidence.
-l know.

435
00:26:53,609 --> 00:26:55,327
-What was your name?
-Sam.

436
00:26:55,529 --> 00:26:56,723
Sam. Right.

437
00:26:56,929 --> 00:27:00,285
-So you guys are just walking?
-We just had lunch.

438
00:27:00,489 --> 00:27:03,606
-What do you do, Sam?
-Aerobics.

439
00:27:03,849 --> 00:27:07,205
And l<i>'</i>m a trainer and some nutrition.

440
00:27:07,449 --> 00:27:10,247
You wanna have dinner at the house?

441
00:27:10,489 --> 00:27:12,161
-She<i>'</i>s a great cook.
-l am.

442
00:27:12,369 --> 00:27:13,597
l don<i>'</i>t think--

443
00:27:13,849 --> 00:27:15,601
-lt<i>'</i>s vegetarian.
-We can<i>'</i>t.

444
00:27:15,809 --> 00:27:19,597
-You don<i>'</i>t eat meat, do you?
-l don<i>'</i>t. She eats a little.

445
00:27:19,809 --> 00:27:24,803
l used to eat meat, then l gave it up.
Then l had some again...

446
00:27:25,049 --> 00:27:28,928
-...and l got so bloated!
-Or there<i>'</i>s a Mexican place.

447
00:27:29,129 --> 00:27:33,168
-Oh, yeah! l flip over couscous!
-You feel like cooking?

448
00:27:33,369 --> 00:27:35,325
-Whatever you want.
-Let<i>'</i>s do it.

449
00:27:35,529 --> 00:27:37,918
Yeah. We<i>'</i>ll watch the Grammys.

450
00:27:38,129 --> 00:27:40,006
l<i>'</i>m not watching that.

451
00:27:40,249 --> 00:27:44,561
-l bet Jill over the best single!
-l<i>'</i>m not watching the Grammys.

452
00:27:44,769 --> 00:27:48,762
-My mother<i>'</i>s in town.
-Yeah, she<i>'</i>s here for a week.

453
00:27:48,969 --> 00:27:52,200
Okay, maybe later.
l<i>'</i>ve been meaning to call.

454
00:27:52,449 --> 00:27:55,407
l<i>'</i>d like to pick up some decaf.

455
00:27:55,609 --> 00:27:59,158
Oh, there<i>'</i>s a great store.
l need some ginseng.

456
00:28:00,329 --> 00:28:04,607
She is so great. You know,
she<i>'</i>s got a degree in psychology.

457
00:28:04,849 --> 00:28:07,409
-She<i>'</i>s into fitness.
-You<i>'</i>re fucking nuts.

458
00:28:07,649 --> 00:28:12,165
She is terrific. She<i>'</i>s a nice girl.
Her family<i>'</i>s from Delaware.

459
00:28:12,369 --> 00:28:14,405
Her father<i>'</i>s in police work.

460
00:28:14,649 --> 00:28:19,404
l can<i>'</i>t get my mind around it.
You leave Sally for this? l<i>'</i>m shocked.

461
00:28:19,609 --> 00:28:24,205
-Careful. l<i>'</i>m serious about her.
-You<i>'</i>re my friend, l love you.

462
00:28:24,449 --> 00:28:27,600
lt<i>'</i>s like your lQ is in remission.

463
00:28:27,849 --> 00:28:32,365
-lt<i>'</i>s like you had a stroke.
-Don<i>'</i>t give some moralizing discourse.

464
00:28:32,569 --> 00:28:35,800
-You<i>'</i>re not my rabbi.
-l just can<i>'</i>t believe it.

465
00:28:36,009 --> 00:28:40,605
You<i>'</i>re with Sally for years.
You raise a family. She<i>'</i>s wonderful.

466
00:28:40,849 --> 00:28:43,921
-So she<i>'</i>s a ball-breaker sometimes--
-She is.

467
00:28:44,129 --> 00:28:47,121
l lived with her, you don<i>'</i>t know her.

468
00:28:47,329 --> 00:28:50,002
l don<i>'</i>t? So tell me something terrible.

469
00:28:50,249 --> 00:28:52,922
There<i>'</i>s nothing terrible to tell you.

470
00:28:53,129 --> 00:28:57,168
l don<i>'</i>t wanna hurt her.
That<i>'</i>s not what this is about.

471
00:28:57,369 --> 00:29:01,408
Suddenly you take up
with a cocktail waitress--

472
00:29:01,649 --> 00:29:06,006
-She<i>'</i>s not a cocktail waitress.
-l think of you and Sally--

473
00:29:06,209 --> 00:29:10,202
She<i>'</i>s warm and she<i>'</i>s nice
and l can relax around her.

474
00:29:10,449 --> 00:29:13,407
Sally was hyper. You know that.

475
00:29:13,649 --> 00:29:16,959
She<i>'</i>s great, but she<i>'</i>s
cold and difficult.

476
00:29:17,169 --> 00:29:20,764
Her Radcliffe friends and the crap
about her decorator.

477
00:29:20,969 --> 00:29:22,641
l was bored at the opera.

478
00:29:22,849 --> 00:29:27,365
She<i>'</i>d never go to a game.
We<i>'</i>d never just relax.

479
00:29:27,569 --> 00:29:30,800
lf l put an ashtray down
in the wrong place, that was it!

480
00:29:31,049 --> 00:29:36,248
-lt took 1 5 years to understand this?
-l should<i>'</i>ve done it before now.

481
00:29:36,449 --> 00:29:39,998
But we had kids and we<i>'</i>re
all scared of being alone.

482
00:29:40,209 --> 00:29:43,360
l love Sally. But what<i>'</i>s
wrong with aerobics?

483
00:29:43,609 --> 00:29:47,522
-What am l? A snob?
-What<i>'</i>s it got to do with aerobics?

484
00:29:47,729 --> 00:29:50,801
Big deal. So she<i>'</i>s not
Simone de Beauvoir.

485
00:29:51,009 --> 00:29:54,001
l want somebody who screams
when l fuck her.

486
00:29:54,249 --> 00:29:57,207
She<i>'</i>s a fucking cocktail waitress.

487
00:29:57,449 --> 00:30:02,000
That<i>'</i>s not your business. You don<i>'</i>t
know what goes on between us.

488
00:30:02,249 --> 00:30:05,366
l<i>'</i>m tired of being corrected
and criticized.

489
00:30:05,569 --> 00:30:08,163
That<i>'</i>s all l ever did with Sally.

490
00:30:08,369 --> 00:30:11,964
And your mother is not in town.
She<i>'</i>s in Florida.

491
00:30:12,369 --> 00:30:17,523
l think no matter how hard we worked,
the marriage wouldn<i>'</i>t have lasted.

492
00:30:17,729 --> 00:30:20,163
How long were you and Judy married?

493
00:30:21,529 --> 00:30:22,803
Five years.

494
00:30:23,049 --> 00:30:26,758
-Why did you split up?
-l thought l wanted out.

495
00:30:26,969 --> 00:30:30,200
l felt l had just run out of gas.

496
00:30:30,449 --> 00:30:34,328
But as l look back, l think
it was Judy who wanted out.

497
00:30:34,529 --> 00:30:35,962
So she left you?

498
00:30:36,169 --> 00:30:40,162
No, she<i>'</i>d never--
That<i>'</i>s not her style.

499
00:30:40,529 --> 00:30:45,000
Don<i>'</i>t let Judy fool you. She<i>'</i>s
what l call passive-aggressive.

500
00:30:45,249 --> 00:30:48,559
Everything is,
<i>''</i> Poor me, give me a break.<i>''</i>

501
00:30:48,769 --> 00:30:50,805
But she gets what she wants.

502
00:30:51,049 --> 00:30:54,758
l remember when she met her
current husband, Gabe Roth.

503
00:30:55,009 --> 00:30:57,523
My husband and daughter are staying...

504
00:30:57,729 --> 00:31:00,801
...but l<i>'</i>m leaving tomorrow.
l have to work.

505
00:31:01,009 --> 00:31:05,207
-Let me give you a lift.
-No, don<i>'</i>t be silly.

506
00:31:05,449 --> 00:31:08,202
-Why go on the train?
-lt<i>'</i>s fine.

507
00:31:08,449 --> 00:31:13,125
-Would you like something to eat?
-Me? No. l<i>'</i>ll get you something.

508
00:31:13,329 --> 00:31:16,366
-l was just on my way.
-Don<i>'</i>t be silly.

509
00:31:16,609 --> 00:31:19,169
-Pasta? Anything else?
-That<i>'</i>s fine.

510
00:31:19,369 --> 00:31:22,600
-l can easily get a cab.
-Why should you?

511
00:31:22,849 --> 00:31:25,568
<i>See? He winds up getting the food.</i>

512
00:31:25,809 --> 00:31:28,528
<i>He changes his schedule,</i>
<i>drives her home.</i>

513
00:31:28,729 --> 00:31:33,245
<i>And all the time it's,</i>
<i>''No, I'll be okay. Don't help me. ''</i>

514
00:31:33,449 --> 00:31:38,364
What he doesn<i>'</i>t say is that for
the last two years of our marriage...

515
00:31:38,609 --> 00:31:41,806
...he was virtually impotent,
when it came to me.

516
00:31:42,049 --> 00:31:46,759
He was just raging because l didn<i>'</i>t
turn out to be what he thought--

517
00:31:46,969 --> 00:31:50,359
He thought l<i>'</i>d be one thing.
His mother, to be exact.

518
00:31:50,569 --> 00:31:55,723
And l couldn<i>'</i>t take the fact that
he was unromantic in every way.

519
00:31:55,929 --> 00:31:59,399
He<i>'</i>d give you an appliance
for your birthday.

520
00:31:59,609 --> 00:32:04,205
l never got her a Melior coffeemaker
for a birthday present.

521
00:32:04,409 --> 00:32:06,604
l got her a camera once.

522
00:32:06,849 --> 00:32:10,000
And an enlarger for our anniversary.

523
00:32:10,209 --> 00:32:11,927
She asked for it.

524
00:32:14,689 --> 00:32:16,520
What are you thinking about?

525
00:32:16,929 --> 00:32:18,521
l don<i>'</i>t know.

526
00:32:18,769 --> 00:32:22,159
l was thinking about
that manuscript you<i>'</i>re reading.

527
00:32:22,409 --> 00:32:26,880
-lt<i>'</i>s just a terrible novel--
-Very autobiographical.

528
00:32:27,089 --> 00:32:30,365
-What else can l work on?
-Should l be insulted?

529
00:32:30,609 --> 00:32:31,962
Why insulted?

530
00:32:32,209 --> 00:32:35,724
The way we met.
That party in the Hamptons?

531
00:32:35,969 --> 00:32:39,757
<i>''He spotted her from a distance</i>
<i>and Harriet leapt to mind.</i>

532
00:32:40,009 --> 00:32:44,366
<i>He was drawn to her instantly</i>
<i>because she reminded him...</i>

533
00:32:44,609 --> 00:32:46,759
<i>... of his only genuine passion.</i>

534
00:32:47,009 --> 00:32:49,523
<i>His sixth sense told him</i>
<i>to move on it.</i>

535
00:32:49,729 --> 00:32:54,325
<i>But she wasn't Harriet. The minute</i>
<i>he met her, the dream evaporated. ''</i>

536
00:32:54,569 --> 00:32:57,402
-So she wasn<i>'</i>t crazy.
-No, just boring.

537
00:32:57,649 --> 00:33:00,368
She<i>'</i>s the best.
That<i>'</i>s why he marries her.

538
00:33:00,609 --> 00:33:04,568
-But he pays a price.
-This is junk. l<i>'</i>ll throw it away.

539
00:33:04,809 --> 00:33:09,325
You<i>'</i>re wrong. lt<i>'</i>s full
of vitality and wit. lt<i>'</i>s good.

540
00:33:09,529 --> 00:33:12,362
-You<i>'</i>re prejudiced, you<i>'</i>re my wife.
-Your dull wife.

541
00:33:12,569 --> 00:33:16,642
l don<i>'</i>t know why you ask
for my opinion. You don<i>'</i>t care.

542
00:33:16,889 --> 00:33:19,722
-lt<i>'</i>s not true.
-lt is true.

543
00:33:20,009 --> 00:33:22,318
l think it<i>'</i>s a mediocre novel.

544
00:33:22,529 --> 00:33:27,444
You have no respect for my judgment.
lf somebody else said that...

545
00:33:27,689 --> 00:33:31,477
-...you<i>'</i>d accept it totally.
-l would not.

546
00:33:32,849 --> 00:33:35,921
<i>After some time,</i>
<i>Judy and Sally had lunch.</i>

547
00:33:36,129 --> 00:33:38,768
<i>Sally made a surprising announcement.</i>

548
00:33:39,009 --> 00:33:41,318
l like being single.

549
00:33:41,529 --> 00:33:44,726
You do?
l had the opposite impression.

550
00:33:44,969 --> 00:33:47,244
That<i>'</i>s anticipatory anxiety.

551
00:33:47,489 --> 00:33:52,643
You realize it<i>'</i>s not as bad as you
fantasized. Like pulling a bad tooth.

552
00:33:52,889 --> 00:33:57,121
All the festering wounds of your
marriage, the disappointments...

553
00:33:57,329 --> 00:34:02,119
...the resentments, they<i>'</i>re gone
in one clean yank and you<i>'</i>re free.

554
00:34:02,609 --> 00:34:07,808
After years of accumulating problems
and swallowing one<i>'</i>s anger...

555
00:34:08,289 --> 00:34:12,248
-...you have a chance to begin again.
-Yeah. l can imagine.

556
00:34:12,449 --> 00:34:18,046
The clock ticks faster for a woman.
Do it while you have some allure left.

557
00:34:18,289 --> 00:34:21,167
The one advantage
of being older is...

558
00:34:21,409 --> 00:34:23,923
...you have a lot of experience.

559
00:34:24,129 --> 00:34:27,565
l have a better shot
at making things work out...

560
00:34:27,809 --> 00:34:29,367
...if l met someone.

561
00:34:29,609 --> 00:34:33,045
lf Gabe and l met now,
knowing all the things we know...

562
00:34:33,289 --> 00:34:36,520
...we<i>'</i>d have a better relationship.
No question.

563
00:34:36,729 --> 00:34:38,959
Would you still marry him?

564
00:34:39,209 --> 00:34:41,723
God, what a question!

565
00:34:44,929 --> 00:34:47,318
You know, for me, l just--

566
00:34:47,569 --> 00:34:50,641
The thought of breaking up
is just so painful.

567
00:34:50,889 --> 00:34:53,926
You can<i>'</i>t stay out of fear.
You know what you become?

568
00:34:54,169 --> 00:34:57,320
-What?
-My mother and father.

569
00:34:58,569 --> 00:34:59,718
Well...

570
00:35:00,809 --> 00:35:04,119
...l<i>'</i>ve pictured myself free.

571
00:35:05,129 --> 00:35:08,166
-l know you have.
-How do you know?

572
00:35:08,409 --> 00:35:11,162
Because you got so angry
that night...

573
00:35:11,409 --> 00:35:14,162
...when Jack and l said
we were splitting.

574
00:35:14,369 --> 00:35:17,167
l realized we must have
touched a nerve.

575
00:35:17,409 --> 00:35:21,322
-No.
-Yes! lt<i>'</i>s like Hamlet and Oedipus.

576
00:35:21,529 --> 00:35:25,920
You were angry because l did
what you really want to do.

577
00:35:26,169 --> 00:35:30,321
You<i>'</i>re over-dramatizing.
Gabe and l are okay.

578
00:35:30,569 --> 00:35:34,244
-Nobody has it perfect.
-l know. l know.

579
00:35:34,809 --> 00:35:37,243
When it<i>'</i>s good,
nothing<i>'</i>s better.

580
00:35:37,449 --> 00:35:41,920
Listen, l think maybe l have
a possibility for you.

581
00:35:42,129 --> 00:35:44,120
-Tell me.
-Michael Gates?

582
00:35:44,329 --> 00:35:47,321
The one you said was attractive?
ln your office?

583
00:35:47,609 --> 00:35:49,725
He<i>'</i>s only been there a few months.

584
00:35:49,929 --> 00:35:52,887
He had a girlfriend,
but they<i>'</i>ve broken up.

585
00:35:53,089 --> 00:35:57,526
l do think he<i>'</i>s attractive.
He<i>'</i>s charming, he<i>'</i>s bright.

586
00:35:57,729 --> 00:35:59,845
The timing<i>'</i>s perfect.

587
00:36:00,089 --> 00:36:04,844
Come up to the office now
and meet him. See how you feel.

588
00:36:05,089 --> 00:36:08,161
lf you<i>'</i>re interested,
we could all...

589
00:36:08,409 --> 00:36:10,969
...arrange something
or go out together.

590
00:36:11,169 --> 00:36:15,765
Michael, this is Sally.
l<i>'</i>m finding some back issues for her.

591
00:36:16,009 --> 00:36:19,479
-She<i>'</i>s with the Preservation Committee.
-Preservation?

592
00:36:19,689 --> 00:36:24,319
l don<i>'</i>t believe in capital punishment
except for New York builders.

593
00:36:24,529 --> 00:36:25,564
Not just New York.

594
00:36:25,809 --> 00:36:29,961
There<i>'</i>s always a blind passion
for the new, the young.

595
00:36:30,169 --> 00:36:34,447
Listen, you two wait here
and l<i>'</i>ll be right with you.

596
00:36:34,809 --> 00:36:37,323
-Take your coat off.
-All right.

597
00:36:37,529 --> 00:36:40,760
Throw it anywhere.
We<i>'</i>re putting out an issue...

598
00:36:41,009 --> 00:36:44,319
...of German furniture styles
in the <i>'</i>20s and <i>'</i>30s.

599
00:36:44,529 --> 00:36:49,284
l hate that period. l did my college
thesis on Bauhaus architecture.

600
00:36:49,489 --> 00:36:54,563
lt was called <i>''</i> Function and Fascism.<i>''</i>
This was years ago at Radcliffe.

601
00:36:54,769 --> 00:36:59,524
lt was very unpopular. Not that it
won<i>'</i>t make a good magazine subject.

602
00:36:59,729 --> 00:37:02,766
Have a look at that chair.
Remember that?

603
00:37:03,009 --> 00:37:06,160
-lsn<i>'</i>t it wonderful?
-l truly dislike that chair.

604
00:37:06,409 --> 00:37:08,559
-This one?
-l hated that.

605
00:37:08,769 --> 00:37:11,329
What do you think?
lsn<i>'</i>t he sweet?

606
00:37:11,569 --> 00:37:14,129
-Well, yes. He seems nice.
-Yeah.

607
00:37:14,329 --> 00:37:18,163
-l think he<i>'</i>s great-looking.
-And he<i>'</i>s single and not gay.

608
00:37:18,409 --> 00:37:21,082
l<i>'</i>m telling you, he just broke up.

609
00:37:21,289 --> 00:37:23,519
l don<i>'</i>t know him that well.

610
00:37:23,729 --> 00:37:26,118
He<i>'</i>s quiet.
l like that about him.

611
00:37:26,369 --> 00:37:30,567
He<i>'</i>s got a great sense of humour.
He<i>'</i>s a very charming drunk.

612
00:37:30,809 --> 00:37:33,528
There was a party here
and he<i>'</i>d had a lot.

613
00:37:33,769 --> 00:37:36,966
He was quoting Yeats<i>'</i> poems
and he was crying.

614
00:37:37,209 --> 00:37:38,961
He was? He weeps?

615
00:37:39,209 --> 00:37:43,646
But in the sweetest way.
So shall l get us all together?

616
00:37:43,889 --> 00:37:46,562
He already asked me to lunch.

617
00:37:46,809 --> 00:37:48,322
He did?

618
00:37:51,809 --> 00:37:54,323
We both took courses at Cambridge.

619
00:37:54,529 --> 00:37:57,362
He suggested we have lunch
next week.

620
00:37:57,609 --> 00:38:01,318
That would be great.
l<i>'</i>d be the matchmaker.

621
00:38:01,689 --> 00:38:06,558
l took an instant liking for Sally.
l was immediately attracted.

622
00:38:06,809 --> 00:38:10,518
She spoke her mind,
she spoke her thoughts.

623
00:38:10,769 --> 00:38:13,124
And she<i>'</i>s very sexy, you know?

624
00:38:13,729 --> 00:38:17,768
Look, l wasn<i>'</i>t looking
for another relationship because...

625
00:38:17,969 --> 00:38:21,848
...l<i>'</i>d just split up with Amy
and sworn off getting involved.

626
00:38:22,089 --> 00:38:27,117
But with Sally, there was something
that just hooked in at once.

627
00:38:27,329 --> 00:38:31,322
-So you were grateful to Judy?
-Yes, l was. Very.

628
00:38:31,969 --> 00:38:34,119
lt<i>'</i>s funny, you know.
When l--

629
00:38:34,329 --> 00:38:39,323
When l first got to know Judy,
l thought she was flirting with me.

630
00:38:39,809 --> 00:38:43,438
And l thought she must be
unhappily married.

631
00:38:43,689 --> 00:38:47,728
l met her husband, they seemed
fine. That<i>'</i>s typical of her.

632
00:38:47,929 --> 00:38:49,647
She<i>'</i>s very giving...

633
00:38:49,889 --> 00:38:53,598
...and she did me this favour
by introducing me to Sally.

634
00:38:54,369 --> 00:38:59,124
Your second story was as interesting
as your first. lt was wonderful.

635
00:38:59,329 --> 00:39:01,126
-Great!
-l was knocked out.

636
00:39:01,369 --> 00:39:03,963
l<i>'</i>m thrilled.
l<i>'</i>m so glad you like it.

637
00:39:04,209 --> 00:39:07,645
You<i>'</i>re so encouraging to me.
l want you to know that.

638
00:39:07,889 --> 00:39:10,926
Don<i>'</i>t be silly.
l<i>'</i>m just one opinion.

639
00:39:11,169 --> 00:39:12,568
You<i>'</i>re the opinion.

640
00:39:12,809 --> 00:39:17,564
Your line was great. <i>''</i> Life doesn<i>'</i>t
imitate art, it imitates bad TV.<i>''</i>

641
00:39:17,809 --> 00:39:21,119
-l think it<i>'</i>s completely true.
-Right.

642
00:39:21,609 --> 00:39:26,558
l can<i>'</i>t tell you how much your
opinion means to me, you know.

643
00:39:26,809 --> 00:39:30,324
Listen, you wanna go for a walk?
l mean....

644
00:39:30,569 --> 00:39:32,127
A walk?

645
00:39:32,369 --> 00:39:34,724
-You<i>'</i>re busy, right?
-No, no.

646
00:39:34,929 --> 00:39:38,160
l just meant for a walk,
to discuss....

647
00:39:38,409 --> 00:39:40,877
You want to hear more
about your story.

648
00:39:41,409 --> 00:39:46,119
The way you structured the story--
The tension built up...

649
00:39:46,369 --> 00:39:50,248
...beautifully and you released
the energy in the last paragraph.

650
00:39:50,489 --> 00:39:53,322
-That was very sophisticated.
-Thanks.

651
00:39:53,569 --> 00:39:58,120
l spent five days searching for
the word to describe the husband...

652
00:39:58,329 --> 00:40:01,241
...and came up with <i>''</i>appucious.<i>''</i>
-Appucious.

653
00:40:01,489 --> 00:40:05,164
-l couldn<i>'</i>t find it in the dictionary.
-l made it up.

654
00:40:05,409 --> 00:40:08,799
-Oh, really?
-Yeah, it described it perfectly.

655
00:40:09,009 --> 00:40:11,523
Tolstoy is a full meal.

656
00:40:11,769 --> 00:40:16,126
Turgenev is a fabulous dessert.
That<i>'</i>s how l characterize him.

657
00:40:16,329 --> 00:40:17,318
Dostoyevsky?

658
00:40:17,529 --> 00:40:22,284
Dostoyevsky is a full meal with
a vitamin pill and extra wheat germ.

659
00:40:22,489 --> 00:40:25,447
<i>''</i> l fall upon the thorns of life.
l bleed.<i>''</i>

660
00:40:25,689 --> 00:40:28,522
l used to think that was
so romantic.

661
00:40:29,769 --> 00:40:34,445
To write, to fall in love,
and to experience real passion.

662
00:40:34,689 --> 00:40:38,443
Really? You think passion
could actually be sustained?

663
00:40:38,689 --> 00:40:39,758
l don<i>'</i>t know.

664
00:40:40,009 --> 00:40:43,399
<i>Time</i> magazine said you lose
your sexual attraction...

665
00:40:43,649 --> 00:40:47,324
...for the other person
in four years, l think it was.

666
00:40:48,009 --> 00:40:50,364
<i>Time</i> must know, right?

667
00:40:50,569 --> 00:40:53,322
l sometimes think
of living in Paris.

668
00:40:53,569 --> 00:40:56,242
Europe in general.
l find that romantic.

669
00:40:56,489 --> 00:41:00,323
l like caf life. l<i>'</i>d like
to write, get a flat.

670
00:41:00,569 --> 00:41:01,558
Sounds great.

671
00:41:01,809 --> 00:41:04,323
Walking the streets
is fun in Paris.

672
00:41:04,569 --> 00:41:08,721
Until you<i>'</i>ve been kissed on
a rainy Parisian afternoon...

673
00:41:08,969 --> 00:41:10,766
...you<i>'</i>ve never been kissed.

674
00:41:11,009 --> 00:41:15,207
-And were you kissed?
-l wasn<i>'</i>t kissed, l was the kisser.

675
00:41:15,409 --> 00:41:18,401
Okay, l was wondering...

676
00:41:18,649 --> 00:41:22,608
-...if l could read your novel.
-How<i>'</i>d you know l had a novel?

677
00:41:22,849 --> 00:41:26,125
You mentioned it
when we had lunch that time.

678
00:41:26,329 --> 00:41:29,366
-l<i>'</i>m very disenchanted with it.
-Yes.

679
00:41:29,609 --> 00:41:34,125
l know. l<i>'</i>m only asking you because
l could learn a lot from it.

680
00:41:34,369 --> 00:41:38,328
l would like to know what you
like and what you don<i>'</i>t...

681
00:41:38,529 --> 00:41:41,566
...and why you<i>'</i>re so critical
of it.

682
00:41:41,769 --> 00:41:43,521
Let me think about it.

683
00:41:44,609 --> 00:41:45,962
-Are you okay?
-Yes.

684
00:41:46,209 --> 00:41:49,918
Let me think about it.
l<i>'</i>ll think about it.

685
00:41:50,609 --> 00:41:53,567
-l shouldn<i>'</i>t have asked you.
-No, no, no.

686
00:41:53,809 --> 00:41:56,243
-Let me think about it.
-Okay.

687
00:41:56,969 --> 00:42:01,121
Gabe. He<i>'</i>s always picked
the wrong women. Except for Judy.

688
00:42:01,329 --> 00:42:05,368
She<i>'</i>s the first sane woman
he fell for. He<i>'</i>s attracted...

689
00:42:05,609 --> 00:42:07,918
...to the crazies, the nut cases.

690
00:42:08,449 --> 00:42:12,442
l got a couple of theories about it.
One is that...

691
00:42:12,689 --> 00:42:16,318
...he knows it<i>'</i>s not gonna work
and so he suffers.

692
00:42:16,569 --> 00:42:20,721
That kind of atones
for some sort of...

693
00:42:20,969 --> 00:42:24,518
...early-on guilt he<i>'</i>s got over--
What, l don<i>'</i>t know.

694
00:42:24,769 --> 00:42:28,728
Another is, like all of us,
he grew up on...

695
00:42:28,929 --> 00:42:34,083
...movies and novels where
doomed love was romantic.

696
00:42:34,409 --> 00:42:36,639
How are things going with Sam?

697
00:42:36,889 --> 00:42:41,167
Great. Absolutely great.
Saturday, we got up.

698
00:42:41,369 --> 00:42:45,362
<i>We had a run down by the river.</i>
<i>It was a beautiful day.</i>

699
00:42:45,609 --> 00:42:50,763
<i>It was terrific. I'm down</i>
<i>to a good weight. I'm exercising.</i>

700
00:42:51,009 --> 00:42:54,888
<i>It feels incredible</i>
<i>to get in shape. I eat great.</i>

701
00:42:55,089 --> 00:42:57,649
<i>Salads, no meat.</i>
<i>Never touch meat.</i>

702
00:42:57,889 --> 00:43:01,438
<i>Later in the day, we rented</i>
<i>some kind of a video.</i>

703
00:43:01,689 --> 00:43:05,364
<i>Some sort of dopey, funny,</i>
<i>stupid little thing.</i>

704
00:43:05,609 --> 00:43:09,727
<i>Something Sally wouldn't have</i>
<i>allowed. I laughed like hell.</i>

705
00:43:09,929 --> 00:43:14,207
<i>I had a terrific time and I didn't</i>
<i>have to feel guilty about it.</i>

706
00:43:14,449 --> 00:43:17,805
<i>She's not Simone de Beauvoir.</i>
<i>We argue sometimes.</i>

707
00:43:18,049 --> 00:43:22,964
Trust me. lt<i>'</i>s King Lear. Shakespeare
never wrote about a King Leo.

708
00:43:23,209 --> 00:43:28,567
Well, Mr. lntellectual. Shakespeare
wrote in English, not Japanese.

709
00:43:28,809 --> 00:43:30,162
That<i>'</i>s wonderful.

710
00:43:30,529 --> 00:43:33,760
l was just gonna make
some cappuccino. You want some?

711
00:43:34,009 --> 00:43:35,727
-No.
-You<i>'</i>re sure?

712
00:43:35,969 --> 00:43:38,244
l<i>'</i>m positive. Absolutely.

713
00:43:40,769 --> 00:43:44,318
Don<i>'</i>t start getting excited.
l don<i>'</i>t have my diaphragm.

714
00:43:44,529 --> 00:43:48,488
l want to make love to you
without your diaphragm.

715
00:43:49,329 --> 00:43:53,561
-What are you talking about?
-l was thinking about it.

716
00:43:53,809 --> 00:43:57,404
l thought maybe l<i>'</i>ve been
resisting having...

717
00:43:57,889 --> 00:44:01,325
-...a child too strenuously.
-What?

718
00:44:01,569 --> 00:44:04,129
-Since when?
-l don<i>'</i>t know.

719
00:44:04,329 --> 00:44:08,038
These are some thoughts
that l<i>'</i>ve had. Maybe....

720
00:44:08,289 --> 00:44:10,245
Maybe it would be helpful.

721
00:44:10,489 --> 00:44:13,640
What kind of help
did you have in mind?

722
00:44:13,849 --> 00:44:16,522
Are you unhappy in our marriage?

723
00:44:16,729 --> 00:44:21,757
l don<i>'</i>t think about it that much.
Which is probably a good sign.

724
00:44:22,009 --> 00:44:26,127
lt<i>'</i>s late, l<i>'</i>m tired.
Do you want to talk about this now?

725
00:44:26,329 --> 00:44:29,765
All l said was, it was
a good idea to have a baby.

726
00:44:30,009 --> 00:44:33,763
-lt<i>'</i>s not such a good idea.
-Why not, all of a sudden?

727
00:44:34,009 --> 00:44:38,560
We have some straightening out
to do before we have a baby.

728
00:44:38,809 --> 00:44:41,767
You wanted a baby.
Why are you in a bad mood?

729
00:44:41,969 --> 00:44:45,041
-Do you want somebody new?
-No.

730
00:44:45,289 --> 00:44:48,520
Who? Like who? Do you?

731
00:44:49,489 --> 00:44:52,049
-Certainly not a baby.
-So forget it.

732
00:44:52,289 --> 00:44:55,645
-Because l thought you wanted--
-Okay, fine.

733
00:44:57,449 --> 00:45:00,361
Something you wanna say
to me and you<i>'</i>re not?

734
00:45:00,609 --> 00:45:05,000
We don<i>'</i>t want to get into something
you can<i>'</i>t get out of.

735
00:45:05,249 --> 00:45:08,764
You don<i>'</i>t want a baby, right?
That<i>'</i>s what l should--

736
00:45:09,009 --> 00:45:11,921
-You know l do.
-Then we have to work on it.

737
00:45:12,129 --> 00:45:15,439
But not tonight.
Any thought of sex is now....

738
00:45:15,689 --> 00:45:17,725
-l<i>'</i>m sorry.
-Not your fault.

739
00:45:17,969 --> 00:45:21,120
l<i>'</i>m begging you to have
a baby l don<i>'</i>t want.

740
00:45:21,329 --> 00:45:24,958
-l knew you didn<i>'</i>t want it.
-l don<i>'</i>t mean it that way.

741
00:45:25,209 --> 00:45:28,167
You know, it<i>'</i>s late
and l<i>'</i>m confused.

742
00:45:28,409 --> 00:45:32,800
We have a fine marriage. l don<i>'</i>t
know what all this talk is for.

743
00:45:34,209 --> 00:45:38,327
Michael? l brought you a won ton soup
since you were busy.

744
00:45:38,529 --> 00:45:41,043
Thanks, Judy.
You<i>'</i>re a sweetheart.

745
00:45:41,289 --> 00:45:45,567
-l see you<i>'</i>re going to Carnegie Hall.
-To see Mahler<i>'</i>s <i>Ninth.</i>

746
00:45:45,809 --> 00:45:48,403
-Really?
-l hope Sally likes Mahler.

747
00:45:48,649 --> 00:45:52,528
She will. lt<i>'</i>s my favourite.
Here are some napkins.

748
00:45:52,729 --> 00:45:56,722
l<i>'</i>ve got this great place
to bring her to after the concert.

749
00:45:56,969 --> 00:45:59,927
A little supper joint.
lt<i>'</i>s very intimate.

750
00:46:00,129 --> 00:46:04,759
-Courtyard, trellis, fairy lights.
-That<i>'</i>s beautiful.

751
00:46:05,009 --> 00:46:06,522
lt is. lt is.

752
00:46:07,809 --> 00:46:12,724
lt<i>'</i>s funny seeing someone
who<i>'</i>s just left a long marriage.

753
00:46:12,969 --> 00:46:16,564
l bet it<i>'</i>s been a while since
she was romanced, eh?

754
00:46:16,809 --> 00:46:19,118
Yes, l<i>'</i>m sure.

755
00:46:19,969 --> 00:46:24,281
l<i>'</i>m such a square. l<i>'</i>m old-fashioned.
l eat all that stuff up.

756
00:46:24,489 --> 00:46:29,517
Music, intimate restaurants,
candlelight joints and stuff.

757
00:46:29,809 --> 00:46:33,961
Amy used to say l should
have been born in the 1 800s.

758
00:46:34,209 --> 00:46:38,646
-She found it all a bit corny.
-No, not at all. lt<i>'</i>s very sweet.

759
00:46:38,889 --> 00:46:41,357
You go for that stuff too,
don<i>'</i>t you?

760
00:46:41,609 --> 00:46:43,520
-Oh, sure.
-Yeah.

761
00:47:10,329 --> 00:47:13,366
-Tonight was fun, eh?
-Yes, it was good.

762
00:47:13,609 --> 00:47:15,964
And that music was fantastic.

763
00:47:16,209 --> 00:47:19,406
l usually hate Mahler,
but it was good.

764
00:47:19,649 --> 00:47:21,719
The last movement<i>'</i>s too long.

765
00:47:21,969 --> 00:47:25,200
The second movement was good.
lt began well.

766
00:47:25,449 --> 00:47:27,724
-Then it gets sentimental.
-Yeah.

767
00:47:27,929 --> 00:47:30,682
The conductor fought his way out.

768
00:47:30,889 --> 00:47:32,561
Dinner was wonderful.

769
00:47:32,809 --> 00:47:37,166
Although l should teach the chef
how to make an Alfredo sauce.

770
00:47:37,409 --> 00:47:39,047
-Sorry.
-Want to...?

771
00:47:39,289 --> 00:47:40,722
-ls it okay?
-Coffee?

772
00:47:40,969 --> 00:47:42,527
l<i>'</i>d love to.

773
00:47:43,769 --> 00:47:48,684
l<i>'</i>m yawning because l<i>'</i>m hyper-
oxygenating. The ride made me sick.

774
00:47:48,889 --> 00:47:52,325
l<i>'</i>m sorry. l<i>'</i>m not the greatest
driver in the world.

775
00:47:52,569 --> 00:47:56,164
No, your driving was fine,
for the most part.

776
00:47:56,409 --> 00:47:59,446
l shouldn<i>'</i>t have had the last one.
Three<i>'</i>s my limit.

777
00:47:59,689 --> 00:48:02,283
l couldn<i>'</i>t finish the second.

778
00:48:02,529 --> 00:48:05,248
Ah, this is lovely.

779
00:48:05,489 --> 00:48:08,526
Very homely. English pine.
lt<i>'</i>s the finest.

780
00:48:08,729 --> 00:48:12,119
l prefer French.
My decorator screwed me.

781
00:48:12,329 --> 00:48:15,127
lt<i>'</i>s too big.
l have to get a place in town.

782
00:48:15,329 --> 00:48:19,720
lt<i>'</i>s funny how your whole life
changes. l<i>'</i>m scared here alone.

783
00:48:19,929 --> 00:48:22,318
-There<i>'</i>s been robberies.
-l bet.

784
00:48:23,329 --> 00:48:27,766
Do you want to get married again
or do you like being single?

785
00:48:28,009 --> 00:48:29,442
l love being single.

786
00:48:29,689 --> 00:48:34,160
Because l think certain personalities
just need to be married.

787
00:48:34,409 --> 00:48:37,242
-l disagree.
-Well, that<i>'</i>s what they say.

788
00:48:37,489 --> 00:48:40,322
Not me. l thought l did.

789
00:48:41,329 --> 00:48:44,366
l do. l do.
l think it<i>'</i>s time for me.

790
00:48:44,609 --> 00:48:47,567
So why have you
never got married?

791
00:48:47,809 --> 00:48:50,528
Oh, l don<i>'</i>t know.
l got close...

792
00:48:50,729 --> 00:48:54,165
...in my 20s once,
but it didn<i>'</i>t work out.

793
00:48:54,409 --> 00:48:57,162
-ls wine okay?
-Lovely. Thank you.

794
00:48:57,409 --> 00:49:00,526
l want to be alone
for a while at least.

795
00:49:00,929 --> 00:49:04,444
l want to have a few experiences.
lf it happens, great.

796
00:49:04,689 --> 00:49:06,520
lf not, that<i>'</i>s just fine.

797
00:49:07,209 --> 00:49:09,928
l<i>'</i>m sure you<i>'</i>ll get what you want.

798
00:49:10,569 --> 00:49:15,120
-You<i>'</i>re a very beautiful woman.
-Oh, thank you.

799
00:49:24,929 --> 00:49:27,363
-l can<i>'</i>t go so fast.
-l<i>'</i>m sorry.

800
00:49:27,609 --> 00:49:29,725
lt<i>'</i>s just, you know....

801
00:49:30,409 --> 00:49:32,923
-lt<i>'</i>s not my rhythm.
-l understand.

802
00:49:33,129 --> 00:49:34,528
Thank you.

803
00:49:35,049 --> 00:49:37,847
l haven<i>'</i>t been
in a social situation...

804
00:49:38,089 --> 00:49:41,968
...that<i>'</i>s meant anything to me
in a very long time.

805
00:49:42,209 --> 00:49:45,121
Thank you.
l<i>'</i>m glad to know you care.

806
00:49:45,369 --> 00:49:47,166
l wouldn<i>'</i>t be with you...

807
00:49:47,409 --> 00:49:51,721
...if l wasn<i>'</i>t at least
interested in exploring it.

808
00:49:53,529 --> 00:49:56,566
-Well, cheers.
-Cheers.

809
00:49:56,769 --> 00:49:59,761
Tonight<i>'</i>s meant a lot to me.
Thank you.

810
00:50:00,009 --> 00:50:02,523
Lovely.
That<i>'</i>s nice.

811
00:50:10,529 --> 00:50:14,727
-What<i>'</i>s the rush?
-l<i>'</i>m sorry, l apologize. l<i>'</i>m just--

812
00:50:15,009 --> 00:50:18,922
l<i>'</i>m overanxious because
l like you a lot.

813
00:50:19,889 --> 00:50:24,326
Oh, dear.
Michael, what can l say?

814
00:50:25,009 --> 00:50:29,321
l haven<i>'</i>t made love
in such a long time.

815
00:50:29,809 --> 00:50:33,722
My marriage, l told you, was dead.
For years.

816
00:50:33,969 --> 00:50:37,962
l don<i>'</i>t know why. Yes, l do.
The second law of thermodynamics.

817
00:50:38,209 --> 00:50:43,522
Sooner or later, everything
turns to shit. That<i>'</i>s my phrasing.

818
00:50:44,009 --> 00:50:47,126
Strange, often one
doesn<i>'</i>t even see it happen.

819
00:50:47,329 --> 00:50:48,398
l did.

820
00:50:48,609 --> 00:50:51,169
<i>That's the part that kills me.</i>

821
00:50:51,409 --> 00:50:57,086
<i>I was in town working.</i>
<i>Jack was on business, in Chicago.</i>

822
00:50:57,289 --> 00:51:00,326
<i>All of a sudden,</i>
<i>by sheer accident....</i>

823
00:51:16,769 --> 00:51:19,363
-Hi. How you doing?
-Hey, how was Chicago?

824
00:51:19,609 --> 00:51:22,521
lt was good.
l mean, it was busy.

825
00:51:22,729 --> 00:51:26,278
The old guy doesn<i>'</i>t want to settle.

826
00:51:26,489 --> 00:51:29,128
He<i>'</i>s a tough old bird, boy.

827
00:51:35,009 --> 00:51:36,647
l couldn<i>'</i>t bring it up.

828
00:51:36,849 --> 00:51:41,047
l was so hurt.
And so full of rage.

829
00:51:41,329 --> 00:51:43,126
And scared.

830
00:51:44,769 --> 00:51:46,327
For weeks...

831
00:51:46,529 --> 00:51:50,363
...l waited for him to say he<i>'</i>d
met someone. He never did.

832
00:51:50,609 --> 00:51:54,522
Although l was suspicious,
l never found another incident.

833
00:51:54,729 --> 00:51:59,120
So l chose to overlook it
and l hoped it would go away.

834
00:52:00,089 --> 00:52:01,522
But it didn<i>'</i>t.

835
00:52:03,289 --> 00:52:06,838
Because l began thinking...

836
00:52:07,809 --> 00:52:09,959
...of getting rid of him...

837
00:52:10,209 --> 00:52:12,120
...and being single.

838
00:52:12,329 --> 00:52:15,366
And things just got worse
between us.

839
00:52:15,569 --> 00:52:18,527
We put up bigger and bigger fronts.

840
00:52:20,529 --> 00:52:22,167
Now l<i>'</i>m single.

841
00:52:22,409 --> 00:52:26,925
And l realize l<i>'</i>m one of those
people who needs to be married.

842
00:52:32,929 --> 00:52:35,762
-Hey! Hey! Come here.
-Hi.

843
00:52:36,009 --> 00:52:38,318
-Where are you going?
-Home.

844
00:52:38,529 --> 00:52:41,327
-Come on, l<i>'</i>ll give you a lift.
-Great.

845
00:52:41,889 --> 00:52:43,117
Come on.

846
00:52:44,009 --> 00:52:45,761
-l have a surprise.
-What?

847
00:52:46,009 --> 00:52:49,558
l don<i>'</i>t know if you<i>'</i>ll think so.
You can read my novel.

848
00:52:49,809 --> 00:52:53,165
Oh, great! Oh, that<i>'</i>s great!
Thanks.

849
00:52:53,409 --> 00:52:57,925
-You have to go easy on it because--
-Oh, of course.

850
00:52:58,249 --> 00:52:59,762
-Wanna come up?
-Now?

851
00:53:00,009 --> 00:53:03,843
Meet my parents.
They<i>'</i>re so in love with you.

852
00:53:04,209 --> 00:53:07,918
Don<i>'</i>t you wanna see how l live?
What are you doing here?

853
00:53:08,129 --> 00:53:11,644
-This is why l don<i>'</i>t see you.
-What do you mean?

854
00:53:11,889 --> 00:53:15,484
-You<i>'</i>re mistaken.
-l wanted to see what he looked like.

855
00:53:15,689 --> 00:53:17,919
You<i>'</i>re not what l imagined.

856
00:53:18,129 --> 00:53:21,166
This isn<i>'</i>t my boyfriend.
He<i>'</i>s my professor.

857
00:53:21,409 --> 00:53:23,161
-Your professor?
-Yes.

858
00:53:23,369 --> 00:53:26,520
-l<i>'</i>m Professor Gabriel Roth.
-Nice to meet you.

859
00:53:27,209 --> 00:53:28,562
-Columbia?
-Stop.

860
00:53:28,809 --> 00:53:31,243
-Barnard.
-How interested are you?

861
00:53:31,489 --> 00:53:33,844
-Come on.
-l want to ask you something.

862
00:53:34,089 --> 00:53:38,560
-You seduce all your students?
-l don<i>'</i>t know what this is about.

863
00:53:38,769 --> 00:53:41,158
Okay, just go, please.

864
00:53:41,369 --> 00:53:43,963
-What are you doing here?
-You led me on!

865
00:53:44,209 --> 00:53:46,643
l did not!
l told you from day one.

866
00:53:46,889 --> 00:53:50,677
When you have her in your arms,
what does she say to you?

867
00:53:50,889 --> 00:53:54,962
-l don<i>'</i>t know what to say.
-Why are you acting childish?

868
00:53:55,209 --> 00:53:58,326
You<i>'</i>re acting like a 1 5-year-old--
l<i>'</i>m sorry.

869
00:53:58,529 --> 00:54:01,089
You<i>'</i>re sorry.
What do you think l am?

870
00:54:01,289 --> 00:54:04,326
-l don<i>'</i>t know.
-Why don<i>'</i>t you just go in?

871
00:54:04,529 --> 00:54:08,317
l am. What?
l<i>'</i>m trying to help you out.

872
00:54:08,529 --> 00:54:10,247
-l<i>'</i>m cold.
-l<i>'</i>m sorry.

873
00:54:10,449 --> 00:54:12,440
This is my mother.
Gabe Roth.

874
00:54:12,689 --> 00:54:15,965
lt is such an immense pleasure.

875
00:54:16,209 --> 00:54:18,518
-That<i>'</i>s my father.
-Oh.

876
00:54:19,209 --> 00:54:22,121
lt is an honour, sir.
What can we get you?

877
00:54:22,329 --> 00:54:24,604
Nothing.
l<i>'</i>m just-- l<i>'</i>m fine.

878
00:54:24,849 --> 00:54:29,718
Just a sedative, if you have one.
Who was that character downstairs?

879
00:54:29,929 --> 00:54:34,320
l<i>'</i>ll tell you about it later.
lt<i>'</i>s got so sunny all of a sudden.

880
00:54:34,529 --> 00:54:38,727
We<i>'</i>re fans of yours.
We wish you<i>'</i>d still write those...

881
00:54:38,929 --> 00:54:41,921
-Let me take your coat.
-...funny stories.

882
00:54:42,689 --> 00:54:46,125
What were you going to tell me
about that guy?

883
00:54:46,329 --> 00:54:50,720
l better start from the beginning
if l<i>'</i>m gonna tell you.

884
00:54:51,169 --> 00:54:54,525
My father, he had this...
this colleague who was...

885
00:54:54,769 --> 00:54:58,557
-...his business partner.
-This guy was his business partner?

886
00:54:58,809 --> 00:55:04,327
This is why l have to start from
the beginning. lt leads up to him.

887
00:55:04,529 --> 00:55:09,159
My father<i>'</i>s business partner,
he<i>'</i>d come by the house fairly often.

888
00:55:09,369 --> 00:55:13,726
<i>And one day, he told me that</i>
<i>he was in love with me, right?</i>

889
00:55:13,969 --> 00:55:17,962
<i>I was very flattered,</i>
<i>to say the least.</i>

890
00:55:18,209 --> 00:55:21,121
<i>He was real bright and single.</i>

891
00:55:21,369 --> 00:55:25,965
<i>We started having this affair.</i>
<i>Naturally, we told nobody.</i>

892
00:55:26,489 --> 00:55:31,119
l have this friend, Jane.
Her parents were divorced.

893
00:55:31,409 --> 00:55:37,041
Her father, Jerry, developed this
mad crush over me, right?

894
00:55:37,249 --> 00:55:41,003
<i>And before long, I was seeing</i>
<i>both these men.</i>

895
00:55:41,249 --> 00:55:44,605
<i>Instead of being happy,</i>
<i>I was just miserable.</i>

896
00:55:44,849 --> 00:55:50,526
<i>I couldn't get my feelings</i>
<i>straight, so I went to an analyst.</i>

897
00:55:50,769 --> 00:55:54,318
<i>I tried for a few months</i>
<i>to work things out.</i>

898
00:55:54,529 --> 00:55:58,363
<i>Then, one day, he said</i>
<i>he was gonna stop treating me...</i>

899
00:55:58,609 --> 00:56:01,567
<i>...because he felt</i>
<i>it wasn't the thing to do...</i>

900
00:56:01,809 --> 00:56:04,926
<i>...since he was falling</i>
<i>in love with me.</i>

901
00:56:05,609 --> 00:56:10,205
<i>I was taken with him. You can</i>
<i>imagine, he's quite brilliant.</i>

902
00:56:10,649 --> 00:56:13,117
<i>And I started seeing him.</i>

903
00:56:13,329 --> 00:56:17,322
<i>I did.</i>
<i>I broke off from the other two.</i>

904
00:56:18,209 --> 00:56:21,281
<i>Something inside me</i>
<i>told me he couldn't...</i>

905
00:56:21,489 --> 00:56:25,118
...be a very stable person,
let alone a good analyst.

906
00:56:25,329 --> 00:56:29,368
So l never really let things
get too far with him.

907
00:56:30,169 --> 00:56:32,399
<i>Then one night I met Carl.</i>

908
00:56:32,649 --> 00:56:36,528
<i>He was very sweet and</i>
<i>he really came on with me.</i>

909
00:56:36,769 --> 00:56:39,237
<i>I came to my senses.</i>
<i>I said to myself.:</i>

910
00:56:39,489 --> 00:56:41,957
<i>''What am I doing with</i>
<i>these older men?''</i>

911
00:56:42,209 --> 00:56:46,919
<i>So I cleaned up my act</i>
<i>and I've been dating Carl.</i>

912
00:56:47,129 --> 00:56:51,884
<i>As you can see, Richard is so</i>
<i>unstable. He really took it badly.</i>

913
00:56:52,089 --> 00:56:56,446
God! You<i>'</i>ve got material for your
first novel and the sequel...

914
00:56:56,689 --> 00:57:00,318
...and an opera by Puccini here!
This is incredible.

915
00:57:00,569 --> 00:57:04,767
Yes, but don<i>'</i>t you think l<i>'</i>m right?
l mean, Carl, he<i>'</i>s fun.

916
00:57:05,009 --> 00:57:08,922
What the hell am l doing
with the midlife crisis set?

917
00:57:09,169 --> 00:57:13,208
They<i>'</i>re all wonderful,
rather accomplished men.

918
00:57:13,449 --> 00:57:17,044
ln the end, l felt like
l was a symbol of lost youth...

919
00:57:17,289 --> 00:57:20,520
...or unfulfilled dreams.
Am l being dramatic?

920
00:57:20,729 --> 00:57:21,957
Gabe.

921
00:57:22,209 --> 00:57:26,122
Rain<i>'</i>s birthday is coming
up, and we<i>'</i>d love you to come.

922
00:57:26,329 --> 00:57:29,082
-l don<i>'</i>t know.
-He doesn<i>'</i>t want to come.

923
00:57:29,329 --> 00:57:33,322
We would love you to come
for a drink. You and your wife.

924
00:57:33,569 --> 00:57:36,367
Mom, he<i>'</i>s not gonna
come to my birthday.

925
00:57:36,609 --> 00:57:39,965
You<i>'</i>ve been a great influence
on her. lnspirational.

926
00:57:40,209 --> 00:57:41,847
Well, she<i>'</i>s great.

927
00:57:42,089 --> 00:57:44,967
l<i>'</i>d consider it an honour
if you<i>'</i>d come by.

928
00:57:45,169 --> 00:57:49,845
<i>Just as Gabe gave his manuscript to</i>
<i>Rain, Judy also showed her writing.</i>

929
00:57:50,089 --> 00:57:54,924
Listen, l finally got around to
reading these lovely poems.

930
00:57:55,169 --> 00:57:57,603
-You can be honest.
-l am.

931
00:57:57,849 --> 00:58:02,923
-lt<i>'</i>s just a hobby.
-l was moved. They<i>'</i>re full of feeling.

932
00:58:03,129 --> 00:58:06,724
-What does your husband say?
-l<i>'</i>d never show them to him.

933
00:58:06,929 --> 00:58:10,604
He<i>'</i>d be much too critical.
He has very high standards.

934
00:58:10,849 --> 00:58:15,798
-He<i>'</i>d be right too.
-The two you wrote about New England?

935
00:58:16,009 --> 00:58:19,763
There<i>'</i>s a graveyard there
where l<i>'</i>d love to be buried.

936
00:58:20,009 --> 00:58:23,445
l used to say to Amy,
that<i>'</i>s the place l<i>'</i>d choose too.

937
00:58:23,649 --> 00:58:26,925
-Do you want to eat lunch outside?
-Sure.

938
00:58:47,649 --> 00:58:50,163
-Are you soaked?
-No. What about you?

939
00:58:50,409 --> 00:58:52,320
l think just my coat.

940
00:58:52,809 --> 00:58:54,686
-Your hair<i>'</i>s wet.
-ls it?

941
00:58:54,889 --> 00:58:56,720
Thank you, Annie.

942
00:58:57,409 --> 00:59:00,446
-That was fun.
-Yes. My hair<i>'</i>s a mess.

943
00:59:00,689 --> 00:59:02,327
Listen....

944
00:59:02,889 --> 00:59:05,926
-Judy, can l speak frankly to you?
-Sure.

945
00:59:06,169 --> 00:59:10,640
-Thanks for introducing me to Sally.
-Oh. Oh, yeah.

946
00:59:10,889 --> 00:59:14,598
-l think l<i>'</i>m in love with her.
-Gee, that was quick.

947
00:59:14,849 --> 00:59:18,319
Not that she shares my feelings
or ever will.

948
00:59:18,529 --> 00:59:22,761
-She hasn<i>'</i>t been single that long.
-Yeah, but it<i>'</i>s like...

949
00:59:23,009 --> 00:59:26,922
...l like someone and can<i>'</i>t
wait for the other shoe to fall.

950
00:59:27,169 --> 00:59:28,568
You probably had--

951
00:59:28,809 --> 00:59:32,722
You<i>'</i>re just a little gun-shy
from some bad experiences.

952
00:59:32,929 --> 00:59:35,318
ls she as terrific as she seems?

953
00:59:35,529 --> 00:59:38,043
She is.
She<i>'</i>s wonderful. She<i>'</i>s...

954
00:59:38,289 --> 00:59:42,168
...honest and decent....
l can<i>'</i>t say enough good things.

955
00:59:42,409 --> 00:59:45,526
Thank you, Judy. You know
l respect your opinion.

956
00:59:45,729 --> 00:59:47,321
Do you mind if l--?

957
00:59:47,569 --> 00:59:50,322
l<i>'</i>m just feeling a little funny.

958
00:59:50,569 --> 00:59:53,402
-l<i>'</i>ll get you a....
-l<i>'</i>m fine.

959
00:59:54,489 --> 01:00:00,166
l don<i>'</i>t know why l introduced them.
Why did l push them together?

960
01:00:00,369 --> 01:00:04,647
When obviously,
l had feelings for him myself.

961
01:00:04,889 --> 01:00:08,325
l was just confused.
l didn<i>'</i>t know what l wanted.

962
01:00:19,369 --> 01:00:24,124
You look good. You don<i>'</i>t get any
older. You work out, huh?

963
01:00:24,329 --> 01:00:29,005
Since Sally and l broke up, l<i>'</i>m single.
l gotta watch it, you know?

964
01:00:29,249 --> 01:00:32,798
l saw Sally the other night.
She<i>'</i>s dating some guy.

965
01:00:33,049 --> 01:00:35,438
Nice-looking.
Claire can tell you.

966
01:00:35,689 --> 01:00:39,921
Yeah, l think--
What was he? He<i>'</i>s an editor.

967
01:00:40,929 --> 01:00:42,328
So....

968
01:00:42,769 --> 01:00:46,603
What<i>'</i>s the deal? Are they
seeing one another or--?

969
01:00:46,849 --> 01:00:48,043
We don<i>'</i>t know.

970
01:00:48,289 --> 01:00:53,124
l<i>'</i>m drunk, so don<i>'</i>t hold me
responsible. You gave up a great one.

971
01:00:53,369 --> 01:00:55,519
Ken!
He<i>'</i>s having a good time.

972
01:00:55,729 --> 01:01:00,519
No, he<i>'</i>s right. l know.
Look, we were together a lot of years.

973
01:01:00,729 --> 01:01:02,526
She<i>'</i>s a great lady.

974
01:01:02,729 --> 01:01:06,961
She<i>'</i>ll be all right. This guy,
Michael something, seemed fine.

975
01:01:07,169 --> 01:01:09,364
-Let<i>'</i>s go.
-l<i>'</i>m not out of line.

976
01:01:09,609 --> 01:01:14,160
You<i>'</i>re okay, right? That girl,
Samantha, should be in the Olympics.

977
01:01:14,409 --> 01:01:17,526
What do you think?
Are they serious?

978
01:01:17,769 --> 01:01:19,760
-Don<i>'</i>t know.
-What did she say?

979
01:01:20,009 --> 01:01:22,648
We didn<i>'</i>t talk.
For a few minutes we--

980
01:01:22,889 --> 01:01:25,449
She looked great.
Has she had face work?

981
01:01:25,689 --> 01:01:28,806
-Face work?
-We gotta go. Good to see you.

982
01:01:29,049 --> 01:01:30,402
Where is Sam?

983
01:01:30,609 --> 01:01:34,568
lf astrology were true,
twins would have the same fate.

984
01:01:34,809 --> 01:01:37,562
-lt is totally provable!
-From gypsies?

985
01:01:37,809 --> 01:01:42,724
Why wouldn<i>'</i>t it have an influence
on our personalities?

986
01:01:42,969 --> 01:01:45,608
You know who believes this?
My babysitter.

987
01:01:45,809 --> 01:01:48,926
There is more crime
during the full moon.

988
01:01:49,169 --> 01:01:51,319
Well, who knows?

989
01:01:51,849 --> 01:01:54,966
lt<i>'</i>s like the
universe knows this stuff.

990
01:01:55,209 --> 01:01:58,565
You guys just don<i>'</i>t get
the fundamental basics--

991
01:01:58,769 --> 01:02:03,559
You should meet my babysitter.
She doesn<i>'</i>t know anyone in New York.

992
01:02:03,809 --> 01:02:07,563
-She<i>'</i>s been with me two months.
-Fabulous....

993
01:02:07,809 --> 01:02:11,518
-My ex-wife believed in this.
-You should listen to her.

994
01:02:11,729 --> 01:02:15,165
l<i>'</i>m just making a point.
Because the position...

995
01:02:15,409 --> 01:02:18,560
...of the planets
is crucial to your life.

996
01:02:18,809 --> 01:02:21,721
l can<i>'</i>t stress this enough.
And your body--

997
01:02:21,969 --> 01:02:24,642
-Be logical.
-But l<i>'</i>m totally logical.

998
01:02:24,889 --> 01:02:27,039
l would not put a Sagittarius--

999
01:02:27,289 --> 01:02:29,564
Sam, we gotta go. Come on.

1000
01:02:29,769 --> 01:02:33,557
-We<i>'</i>re just getting started.
-lt was good to see you.

1001
01:02:33,809 --> 01:02:37,643
-lt<i>'</i>s early!
-lt<i>'</i>s getting later. See you, guys.

1002
01:02:37,849 --> 01:02:40,522
-lt was nice meeting you.
-Come on.

1003
01:02:40,729 --> 01:02:45,120
lf you don<i>'</i>t know what you<i>'</i>re talking
about, why don<i>'</i>t you not talk?

1004
01:02:45,369 --> 01:02:47,405
They don<i>'</i>t know what
they<i>'</i>re saying!

1005
01:02:47,649 --> 01:02:50,766
You feel obligated to talk.
How about listening?

1006
01:02:51,009 --> 01:02:54,285
-l listen!
-That<i>'</i>s a novel idea for you.

1007
01:02:54,489 --> 01:02:58,164
You are so rude.
l can<i>'</i>t believe you just did that!

1008
01:02:58,409 --> 01:03:01,765
-You<i>'</i>re the expert.
-That<i>'</i>s the most embarrassing--

1009
01:03:02,009 --> 01:03:04,807
Let<i>'</i>s get out before
you make it any worse.

1010
01:03:08,289 --> 01:03:12,043
-This bullshit astrology. lt<i>'</i>s stupid.
-lt<i>'</i>s not stupid.

1011
01:03:12,289 --> 01:03:16,567
l<i>'</i>m sick of listening to your crap
about soybeans and Zen foods.

1012
01:03:16,809 --> 01:03:19,323
-Get in the car!
-Leave me alone. No.

1013
01:03:19,569 --> 01:03:23,357
-Who do you think you<i>'</i>re talking to?
-You wanna embarrass me?

1014
01:03:23,609 --> 01:03:28,524
They<i>'</i>re making intellectual talk,
and you<i>'</i>re jerking off about tofu.

1015
01:03:28,729 --> 01:03:32,438
-Believe me, they<i>'</i>re just stupid!
-Get in the car.

1016
01:03:32,689 --> 01:03:34,520
-l<i>'</i>m not going.
-You are.

1017
01:03:34,769 --> 01:03:36,919
-Help!
-Shut up, will you?

1018
01:03:37,129 --> 01:03:39,359
Shut your mouth! Are you crazy?

1019
01:03:39,609 --> 01:03:41,759
-l wanna embarrass you!
-Embarrass me?

1020
01:03:42,009 --> 01:03:44,728
-Are you coming?
-l hate you and your...

1021
01:03:44,929 --> 01:03:47,921
...stupid fucking asshole friends!

1022
01:03:48,129 --> 01:03:50,165
Get in.
Get in the car.

1023
01:03:50,409 --> 01:03:53,560
-Where<i>'</i>s my bag?
-l don<i>'</i>t know. lt doesn<i>'</i>t matter.

1024
01:03:53,809 --> 01:03:55,959
Here. Get in the car.

1025
01:03:56,209 --> 01:04:00,441
Goddamn, l must have been
out of my mind. You<i>'</i>re crazy.

1026
01:04:00,689 --> 01:04:05,717
-You<i>'</i>re too drunk to drive.
-Just shut up and let<i>'</i>s go.

1027
01:04:07,449 --> 01:04:10,521
-Goddamn it!
-Look what you<i>'</i>ve done now! Just--

1028
01:04:11,129 --> 01:04:13,643
Let me out of here!
Let me out of here!

1029
01:04:13,889 --> 01:04:17,325
-Will you just stop?!
-l<i>'</i>m not stopping.

1030
01:04:18,089 --> 01:04:20,284
-Get in the car!
-You maniac!

1031
01:04:20,489 --> 01:04:21,922
Trying to be cute?

1032
01:04:22,209 --> 01:04:23,324
No!

1033
01:04:23,569 --> 01:04:25,241
-Get in the car!
-No!

1034
01:04:25,489 --> 01:04:28,561
-Oh, l don<i>'</i>t believe this.
-No! Help!

1035
01:04:28,809 --> 01:04:31,960
What am l doing?
Get in the car, you infant!

1036
01:04:32,209 --> 01:04:34,564
Get in the fucking car!

1037
01:04:34,769 --> 01:04:36,327
Christ!

1038
01:05:00,969 --> 01:05:04,928
You had an orgasm with Michael
and not with your husband?

1039
01:05:05,129 --> 01:05:07,927
l didn<i>'</i>t. l was trying very hard.

1040
01:05:08,169 --> 01:05:13,527
-l was tense. l came close.
-What makes it so difficult for you?

1041
01:05:14,209 --> 01:05:17,645
My mind gets racing with thoughts.
You<i>'</i>d laugh.

1042
01:05:17,889 --> 01:05:22,121
-l get so mentally hyperactive.
-Like what?

1043
01:05:24,969 --> 01:05:28,041
<i>I liked what Michael</i>
<i>was doing to me...</i>

1044
01:05:28,289 --> 01:05:31,918
<i>...and it felt different</i>
<i>from Jack. More gentle.</i>

1045
01:05:32,169 --> 01:05:34,922
<i>And...more ex citing.</i>

1046
01:05:35,769 --> 01:05:38,522
<i>How different</i>
<i>Michael was from Jack.</i>

1047
01:05:38,769 --> 01:05:42,318
<i>How much deeper his</i>
<i>vision of life was.</i>

1048
01:05:43,169 --> 01:05:45,160
<i>And I thought...</i>

1049
01:05:45,409 --> 01:05:47,639
<i>...Michael was a hedgehog...</i>

1050
01:05:47,889 --> 01:05:51,325
<i>...and Jack was a fox.</i>

1051
01:05:52,609 --> 01:05:54,122
<i>And then I thought...</i>

1052
01:05:54,329 --> 01:05:56,126
<i>...Judy was a fox...</i>

1053
01:05:56,329 --> 01:05:59,321
<i>...and Gabe was a hedgehog.</i>

1054
01:05:59,609 --> 01:06:02,646
<i>And I thought about all</i>
<i>the people I knew...</i>

1055
01:06:02,889 --> 01:06:04,845
<i>...and which were hedgehogs...</i>

1056
01:06:05,089 --> 01:06:08,001
<i>...and which were foxes.</i>

1057
01:06:08,369 --> 01:06:11,725
<i>Al Simon, a friend,</i>
<i>was a hedgehog.</i>

1058
01:06:11,929 --> 01:06:14,124
<i>His wife, Jenny, was a hedgehog.</i>

1059
01:06:14,369 --> 01:06:17,759
<i>And Cindy Salkind was a fox.</i>

1060
01:06:18,009 --> 01:06:21,558
<i>And Lou Patrino was a hedgehog.</i>

1061
01:06:23,209 --> 01:06:26,121
l had the impression that
at times...

1062
01:06:26,569 --> 01:06:29,037
...you weren<i>'</i>t quite into it.

1063
01:06:29,889 --> 01:06:32,119
No. No!

1064
01:06:34,009 --> 01:06:35,920
l mean....

1065
01:06:36,609 --> 01:06:38,122
You know....

1066
01:06:39,009 --> 01:06:42,126
l told you the problems
l<i>'</i>ve had with Jack.

1067
01:06:42,849 --> 01:06:43,918
No!

1068
01:06:44,169 --> 01:06:46,205
lt was wonderful.

1069
01:06:47,529 --> 01:06:50,168
l<i>'</i>ve hurt your feelings, right?

1070
01:06:50,409 --> 01:06:53,924
Don<i>'</i>t get the wrong impression.
l loved it.

1071
01:06:54,129 --> 01:06:55,528
Me too.

1072
01:07:01,129 --> 01:07:04,166
l used to get excited
when we got married.

1073
01:07:04,409 --> 01:07:07,526
Somewhere along the line,
it slipped away.

1074
01:07:08,809 --> 01:07:10,527
lt<i>'</i>s okay.

1075
01:07:11,089 --> 01:07:14,126
What? That l<i>'</i>m not responsive?

1076
01:07:14,369 --> 01:07:16,121
We had a nice experience.

1077
01:07:16,369 --> 01:07:18,929
We had two separate, nice experiences.

1078
01:07:19,169 --> 01:07:22,718
-But they were nice.
-They were separate.

1079
01:07:26,769 --> 01:07:31,001
-No wonder your husband went crazy.
-Very funny.

1080
01:07:31,249 --> 01:07:33,888
Oh, come on, Sally.

1081
01:07:37,049 --> 01:07:39,927
-You hungry?
-He said, changing the subject.

1082
01:07:40,169 --> 01:07:42,399
Oh, stop it.

1083
01:07:43,169 --> 01:07:45,046
What was that?

1084
01:07:46,129 --> 01:07:50,088
-There<i>'</i>s been some burglaries.
-ls the alarm on?

1085
01:07:51,369 --> 01:07:53,678
Well, call the police.

1086
01:08:06,969 --> 01:08:08,322
-Who are you?
-Who are you?

1087
01:08:08,569 --> 01:08:12,482
-Jack, my God!
-You changed the lock on my own house.

1088
01:08:12,689 --> 01:08:14,998
-Who<i>'</i>s this?
-This is my husband.

1089
01:08:15,249 --> 01:08:18,321
-None of your business. Leave.
-l don<i>'</i>t want to.

1090
01:08:18,569 --> 01:08:21,686
-Are you all right?
-Am l all right?

1091
01:08:21,929 --> 01:08:23,521
ls he living here?

1092
01:08:23,769 --> 01:08:26,522
-Don<i>'</i>t get upset.
-ls he fucking you?

1093
01:08:26,769 --> 01:08:30,478
-This is my house, pal.
-Let<i>'</i>s not get ugly.

1094
01:08:30,689 --> 01:08:32,884
l can talk to him. Go upstairs.

1095
01:08:33,089 --> 01:08:35,683
-Where<i>'</i>s he going?
-Please. l know.

1096
01:08:35,889 --> 01:08:39,484
-You going up to our bed?
-lt<i>'</i>s not our bed anymore.

1097
01:08:39,689 --> 01:08:43,887
Listen, you need some black coffee.
Then just go.

1098
01:08:44,089 --> 01:08:46,478
Listen, l want to come back.

1099
01:08:46,689 --> 01:08:52,321
-You<i>'</i>re drunk.
-Oh, please. My life is such a mess.

1100
01:08:52,569 --> 01:08:56,687
This is not the place to discuss this.
Please go.

1101
01:08:56,929 --> 01:09:01,400
-This is my fucking house.
-This is my fucking house.

1102
01:09:01,649 --> 01:09:04,482
This is my house now.

1103
01:09:05,329 --> 01:09:09,527
-l want to start over again.
-That<i>'</i>s not possible.

1104
01:09:09,769 --> 01:09:11,282
Sally, can l help?

1105
01:09:11,489 --> 01:09:16,404
-Oh, please.
-Would you get lost? What is this?

1106
01:09:16,729 --> 01:09:20,165
-This is ridiculous!
-l can handle this.

1107
01:09:20,369 --> 01:09:23,520
-l don<i>'</i>t believe this.
-You don<i>'</i>t have to. Go.

1108
01:09:23,769 --> 01:09:27,682
You.... Listen.
God, l....

1109
01:09:27,929 --> 01:09:31,808
This was not all my fault.
lt takes two of us--

1110
01:09:32,049 --> 01:09:36,645
-l didn<i>'</i>t say it was all your fault.
-You<i>'</i>re so hard to live with!

1111
01:09:36,849 --> 01:09:41,479
l would just break my back
all the time. See? Perfect.

1112
01:09:41,729 --> 01:09:43,720
What do you want me to say?

1113
01:09:43,969 --> 01:09:47,678
Our marriage was full of problems.
l know that.

1114
01:09:47,929 --> 01:09:50,397
Some were my fault, some were yours.

1115
01:09:50,649 --> 01:09:53,482
You lied to me, you cheated on me--

1116
01:09:53,729 --> 01:09:55,879
Why don<i>'</i>t you run upstairs--?

1117
01:09:56,129 --> 01:09:58,484
-There<i>'</i>s a stranger here.
-He knows.

1118
01:09:58,689 --> 01:10:01,283
He knows. Swell.
That<i>'</i>s perfect too.

1119
01:10:01,489 --> 01:10:05,482
You show me one couple that
doesn<i>'</i>t have problems.

1120
01:10:05,689 --> 01:10:10,285
lt<i>'</i>s tough.
Everybody has a tough time, you know?

1121
01:10:11,969 --> 01:10:16,520
-What about the one you lived with?
-That<i>'</i>s total bullshit.

1122
01:10:16,769 --> 01:10:21,684
-Well, l<i>'</i>ve met someone l like.
-What? You what?

1123
01:10:22,129 --> 01:10:24,563
l met someone l like.

1124
01:10:27,089 --> 01:10:31,685
What about all the years
we had together?

1125
01:10:32,329 --> 01:10:34,081
Well...

1126
01:10:34,329 --> 01:10:38,038
...you had no problem wiping them out
when it suited you.

1127
01:10:38,249 --> 01:10:43,277
But l--
l didn<i>'</i>t know what else to do.

1128
01:10:43,529 --> 01:10:48,842
No! No! l can<i>'</i>t discuss this now.
Please! Go!

1129
01:10:49,089 --> 01:10:55,005
-You<i>'</i>ll feel better tomorrow.
-l<i>'</i>m gonna feel like shit tomorrow.

1130
01:10:55,249 --> 01:10:56,967
Oh, shit.

1131
01:10:57,649 --> 01:11:01,608
Hi. l need to speak to Jack.

1132
01:11:01,929 --> 01:11:05,205
-You<i>'</i>re gonna leave me out there?
-l told you--

1133
01:11:05,489 --> 01:11:08,526
l have never been treated
this way before!

1134
01:11:08,769 --> 01:11:12,398
-Perfect how you ruin a life.
-Then see a psychiatrist.

1135
01:11:12,649 --> 01:11:16,801
-l need to see a shrink, slimebag!
-Come on in.

1136
01:11:17,049 --> 01:11:18,801
This is about all of us.

1137
01:11:19,049 --> 01:11:21,802
-We don<i>'</i>t have any secrets here.
-Bullshit.

1138
01:11:22,049 --> 01:11:25,598
-l never met a Scorpio who wasn<i>'</i>t--
-Will you stop?!

1139
01:11:25,849 --> 01:11:30,320
l<i>'</i>m going to bed.
Get out. Both of you!

1140
01:11:30,569 --> 01:11:31,888
What<i>'</i>s the big deal?

1141
01:11:32,129 --> 01:11:37,249
So l did some things wrong.
Does it have to be irreversible?

1142
01:11:43,889 --> 01:11:47,518
<i>The heart raged,</i>
<i>grew melancholy and confused...</i>

1143
01:11:47,769 --> 01:11:52,479
<i>...and toward what end? To articulate</i>
<i>what nitwit strategy? Procreation?</i>

1144
01:11:53,049 --> 01:11:56,121
<i>It told him something.</i>
<i>How millions of sperm...</i>

1145
01:11:56,369 --> 01:11:59,918
<i>... competed for a single egg,</i>
<i>not the other way around.</i>

1146
01:12:00,169 --> 01:12:03,718
<i>Men would make</i>
<i>love with any number of women...</i>

1147
01:12:03,969 --> 01:12:07,678
<i>... even total strangers,</i>
<i>while females were selective.</i>

1148
01:12:07,929 --> 01:12:12,002
<i>They were catering</i>
<i>to the demands of one small egg.</i>

1149
01:12:12,249 --> 01:12:16,925
<i>While males had millions of</i>
<i>frantic sperms screaming.:</i>

1150
01:12:17,169 --> 01:12:19,922
<i>''Let us out, let us out!''</i>

1151
01:12:20,529 --> 01:12:22,485
<i>It was like personal ads.</i>

1152
01:12:24,569 --> 01:12:29,245
<i>Dozens of requirements followed by,</i>
<i>''Non-smokers only. ''</i>

1153
01:12:29,489 --> 01:12:33,880
<i>Feldman longed to meet an attractive</i>
<i>woman with this personality.:</i>

1154
01:12:34,129 --> 01:12:37,519
<i>A sense of humour equal to his...</i>

1155
01:12:37,769 --> 01:12:41,000
<i>...a love of music equal to his</i>
<i>and a love of...</i>

1156
01:12:41,249 --> 01:12:46,164
<i>...Bach and balmy climates.</i>
<i>In short, himself as a pretty woman.</i>

1157
01:12:47,489 --> 01:12:51,004
<i>Pepkin married and led a warm,</i>
<i>domestic life.</i>

1158
01:12:51,249 --> 01:12:53,922
<i>Placid, but dull.</i>
<i>Knapp was a swinger.</i>

1159
01:12:54,169 --> 01:12:57,798
<i>He eschewed nuptial ties</i>
<i>and bedded different women.:</i>

1160
01:12:58,049 --> 01:13:02,088
<i>Nurses, housewives, students,</i>
<i>a doctor, a salesgirl....</i>

1161
01:13:02,329 --> 01:13:04,889
<i>They all held Knapp between their legs.</i>

1162
01:13:05,089 --> 01:13:08,525
<i>Pepkin, from the calm of his</i>
<i>fidelity, envied Knapp.</i>

1163
01:13:08,769 --> 01:13:12,921
<i>Knapp, lonely beyond belief,</i>
<i>envied Pepkin.</i>

1164
01:13:13,649 --> 01:13:18,006
<i>What happened after the honeymoon?</i>
<i>Did desire grow...</i>

1165
01:13:18,249 --> 01:13:21,798
<i>... or did familiarity make partners</i>
<i>want other lovers?</i>

1166
01:13:22,049 --> 01:13:25,678
<i>Was the notion of</i>
<i>ever-deepening romance a myth...</i>

1167
01:13:25,929 --> 01:13:28,489
<i>...along with simultaneous orgasm?</i>

1168
01:13:28,729 --> 01:13:32,085
<i>The only time Rifkin and his wife</i>
<i>experienced one...</i>

1169
01:13:32,329 --> 01:13:35,480
<i>... was when they were granted</i>
<i>their divorce.</i>

1170
01:13:35,929 --> 01:13:40,844
<i>Maybe in the end, the idea was</i>
<i>not to expect too much out of life.</i>

1171
01:13:41,729 --> 01:13:43,720
So the book was wonderful.

1172
01:13:43,969 --> 01:13:46,802
Entertaining,
imaginative and moving....

1173
01:13:47,049 --> 01:13:51,281
You don<i>'</i>t have to say this. You
can be critical. Be honest.

1174
01:13:51,489 --> 01:13:53,878
You make suffering so funny.

1175
01:13:54,089 --> 01:13:56,205
The lost souls running around.

1176
01:13:56,449 --> 01:13:59,885
That<i>'</i>s funny. l<i>'</i>ve had so much trouble
with the book.

1177
01:14:00,089 --> 01:14:04,287
-Has anybody else read it?
-Not exactly, you know.

1178
01:14:04,529 --> 01:14:09,808
l<i>'</i>m so thrilled you feel this way.
l can<i>'</i>t tell you how encouraged l am.

1179
01:14:10,049 --> 01:14:13,086
Your feelings
about it are really....

1180
01:14:13,329 --> 01:14:17,925
But you are a sucker for my work.
l shouldn<i>'</i>t get too excited.

1181
01:14:18,169 --> 01:14:23,289
l<i>'</i>m objective and, yes,
l do love the way you write.

1182
01:14:23,489 --> 01:14:27,607
-l had some criticisms--
-l<i>'</i>m sure you did.

1183
01:14:27,849 --> 01:14:29,282
What were they?

1184
01:14:29,569 --> 01:14:33,118
Nothing serious.
The whole thing was just a delight.

1185
01:14:33,369 --> 01:14:38,363
Really? l<i>'</i>ve had such a love-hate
relationship with this book.

1186
01:14:38,969 --> 01:14:41,119
-Oh my God, this can<i>'</i>t be--
-What?

1187
01:14:41,369 --> 01:14:44,520
l think l left it in the cab.

1188
01:14:45,649 --> 01:14:50,120
You<i>'</i>re kidding! ln a taxicab?
Are you sure?

1189
01:14:50,369 --> 01:14:54,078
l can<i>'</i>t believe l did this to you!
Okay, he was lndian.

1190
01:14:54,369 --> 01:14:56,439
You left it in an lndian<i>'</i>s cab?

1191
01:14:56,689 --> 01:14:58,088
No. He was Armenian.

1192
01:14:58,369 --> 01:15:00,087
That was the only copy.

1193
01:15:00,289 --> 01:15:02,245
-l know.
-You must be joking.

1194
01:15:02,449 --> 01:15:07,477
-Hargopian?
-Mr. Hargopian, Swami Hargopian, what?

1195
01:15:26,049 --> 01:15:28,882
l was totally crushed.
l wanted to die.

1196
01:15:29,089 --> 01:15:31,887
This was the worst thing that happened.

1197
01:15:32,129 --> 01:15:35,917
-You put up a false front.
-The poor girl was wrecked.

1198
01:15:36,169 --> 01:15:38,603
l was trying to bail her out.

1199
01:15:38,849 --> 01:15:43,320
So this book was very meaningful
to you despite what you said.

1200
01:15:43,569 --> 01:15:47,084
-l guess so.
-And the young woman, Rain?

1201
01:15:47,329 --> 01:15:51,083
Her approbation was
very significant to me.

1202
01:15:51,329 --> 01:15:54,207
Why was her encouragement
so pleasing?

1203
01:15:54,449 --> 01:15:59,284
Your own wife liked it very much
and you gave her a hard time.

1204
01:16:01,969 --> 01:16:06,884
l don<i>'</i>t know. There was some kind
of rapport l felt here that was...

1205
01:16:07,129 --> 01:16:08,323
...meaningful.

1206
01:16:09,249 --> 01:16:12,639
Hey! Hey!
Somebody found your envelope.

1207
01:16:13,129 --> 01:16:15,563
They<i>'</i>re waiting at the house now.

1208
01:16:16,329 --> 01:16:20,208
lt<i>'</i>s-- lt<i>'</i>s so Freudian.

1209
01:16:20,449 --> 01:16:22,280
What is?

1210
01:16:23,849 --> 01:16:28,206
The whole thing, leaving
the novel in the cab.

1211
01:16:28,449 --> 01:16:31,327
Don<i>'</i>t be silly.
lt could happen to anybody.

1212
01:16:31,569 --> 01:16:36,165
No, l think maybe it meant something.

1213
01:16:37,049 --> 01:16:39,483
-Like what?
-Well...

1214
01:16:39,729 --> 01:16:44,120
...l don<i>'</i>t know.
Maybe l could have been threatened.

1215
01:16:44,369 --> 01:16:46,803
-Threatened by my book?
-Yeah.

1216
01:16:47,049 --> 01:16:51,679
-l<i>'</i>m very competitive by nature.
-That<i>'</i>s absurd.

1217
01:16:51,889 --> 01:16:54,528
Why, because l<i>'</i>m a young female?

1218
01:16:54,769 --> 01:16:57,522
Don<i>'</i>t get angry.
l<i>'</i>m in your corner.

1219
01:16:57,769 --> 01:17:01,603
-l<i>'</i>m your biggest fan.
-Yeah.

1220
01:17:04,649 --> 01:17:09,564
l just think l could have been
threatened by certain things.

1221
01:17:10,729 --> 01:17:13,289
Like what?

1222
01:17:13,489 --> 01:17:17,721
Some of the attitudes towards
women and your ideas on life.

1223
01:17:17,969 --> 01:17:22,884
-You told me you loved the book.
-l do. l do love it.

1224
01:17:23,089 --> 01:17:25,808
-What were your criticisms?
-Nothing.

1225
01:17:26,009 --> 01:17:28,045
Tell me your criticisms.

1226
01:17:28,929 --> 01:17:33,127
l was a little disappointed
with some of your attitudes.

1227
01:17:33,369 --> 01:17:36,600
Like what? What attitudes? With what?

1228
01:17:36,849 --> 01:17:40,319
The way people just
casually have affairs like that.

1229
01:17:40,569 --> 01:17:44,881
The book doesn<i>'</i>t condone affairs.
l<i>'</i>m exaggerating for comedy.

1230
01:17:45,129 --> 01:17:50,681
Are our choices really between chronic
dissatisfaction and suburban drudgery?

1231
01:17:50,889 --> 01:17:54,802
l<i>'</i>m deliberately distorting it.
l<i>'</i>m trying to show...

1232
01:17:55,049 --> 01:17:58,121
...how hard it is to be married.

1233
01:17:58,369 --> 01:18:02,157
You have to be careful not to
trivialize things like that.

1234
01:18:02,409 --> 01:18:04,081
Jesus, l hope l haven<i>'</i>t.

1235
01:18:04,369 --> 01:18:07,406
The lead character<i>'</i>s
views on women...

1236
01:18:07,649 --> 01:18:10,527
...is so retrograde, so shallow.

1237
01:18:10,769 --> 01:18:13,886
What?
You told me it was a great book.

1238
01:18:14,089 --> 01:18:17,001
l never said great, l said it<i>'</i>s...

1239
01:18:17,249 --> 01:18:19,126
...brilliant and it<i>'</i>s alive.

1240
01:18:19,369 --> 01:18:23,920
We<i>'</i>re not arguing about
whether it<i>'</i>s brilliant or not.

1241
01:18:24,169 --> 01:18:29,084
<i>Triumph of the Will</i> was a great
movie, but you despise its ideology.

1242
01:18:29,369 --> 01:18:31,678
So you despise my ideas?

1243
01:18:31,889 --> 01:18:35,359
No, l don<i>'</i>t despise them.
That example was--

1244
01:18:38,329 --> 01:18:40,923
lsn<i>'</i>t it beneath you as a thinker...

1245
01:18:41,169 --> 01:18:45,321
...to allow your lead character
to waste so much energy...

1246
01:18:45,569 --> 01:18:49,084
...obsessing over a psychotic woman...

1247
01:18:49,329 --> 01:18:53,481
...that you fantasize as powerfully
sexual and inspired...

1248
01:18:53,729 --> 01:18:56,118
...when she was pitifully sick.

1249
01:18:56,449 --> 01:19:00,488
l don<i>'</i>t need a lecture on writing
from a 20-year-old twit.

1250
01:19:00,689 --> 01:19:04,398
You asked to read my book,
you said you loved it--

1251
01:19:04,649 --> 01:19:07,288
-And l do.
-You leave it in a taxicab.

1252
01:19:07,489 --> 01:19:11,198
You<i>'</i>re weeping, l<i>'</i>m consoling you
and you turn on me.

1253
01:19:11,449 --> 01:19:14,122
Okay. Well, l must have hit a nerve.

1254
01:19:14,369 --> 01:19:16,929
Well, yeah. You know....

1255
01:19:17,169 --> 01:19:21,720
l<i>'</i>d hate to be your boyfriend.
He must go through hell.

1256
01:19:21,969 --> 01:19:24,119
Well, l<i>'</i>m worth it.

1257
01:19:40,809 --> 01:19:44,722
-Any trouble finding the house?
-No, it was very easy.

1258
01:19:44,969 --> 01:19:46,721
Please. Step this way.

1259
01:19:46,969 --> 01:19:49,403
l<i>'</i>m so glad you found the house.

1260
01:19:49,649 --> 01:19:52,004
-This was so nice.
-lt<i>'</i>s fine.

1261
01:19:52,249 --> 01:19:56,162
l jumped in the cab and wound
up sitting on it.

1262
01:19:56,409 --> 01:19:59,924
That<i>'</i>s so nice of you.
Let me give you some--

1263
01:20:00,169 --> 01:20:02,763
-No, it<i>'</i>s okay.
-Really, l can<i>'</i>t--

1264
01:20:02,969 --> 01:20:06,723
-l want you to stay for coffee.
-No, you<i>'</i>re--

1265
01:20:06,929 --> 01:20:09,318
-l won<i>'</i>t take no for--
-She won<i>'</i>t.

1266
01:20:09,569 --> 01:20:12,686
-We<i>'</i>ll have coffee.
-Okay, good.

1267
01:20:12,929 --> 01:20:16,001
-l<i>'</i>m sorry--
-l<i>'</i>m sorry, it was my fault.

1268
01:20:16,209 --> 01:20:17,688
lt was totally--

1269
01:20:17,889 --> 01:20:22,360
lf you don<i>'</i>t mind my saying,
you have a beautiful daughter.

1270
01:20:22,969 --> 01:20:27,520
l admit it,
her argument in the cab...

1271
01:20:27,769 --> 01:20:32,479
...l found attractive.
lt attracted me to her.

1272
01:20:32,689 --> 01:20:37,809
That she was not a passive,
worshipful pupil.

1273
01:20:38,049 --> 01:20:42,520
Something in me sensed...

1274
01:20:42,769 --> 01:20:45,681
...not that l<i>'</i>d
do anything about it...

1275
01:20:45,929 --> 01:20:50,047
...l had, you know,
certain daydreams about it.

1276
01:20:50,369 --> 01:20:53,202
<i>A week later,</i>
<i>Jack and Sally reunited.</i>

1277
01:20:53,449 --> 01:20:56,122
<i>This was celebrated over dinner.</i>

1278
01:20:56,369 --> 01:21:00,328
You can<i>'</i>t just wipe out
years of closeness.

1279
01:21:00,569 --> 01:21:03,720
You think you can.
But the roots are there.

1280
01:21:03,969 --> 01:21:08,087
l think some people are just not
meant to be single.

1281
01:21:08,289 --> 01:21:11,406
Everybody screws up.
The question is...

1282
01:21:11,649 --> 01:21:13,719
...do you learn from it?

1283
01:21:13,969 --> 01:21:17,803
l think the true test is
how you weather a crisis.

1284
01:21:18,049 --> 01:21:22,088
Everyone looks great when
everything<i>'</i>s going smoothly.

1285
01:21:22,289 --> 01:21:26,248
lt<i>'</i>s great. lf you can be
that mature, it<i>'</i>s great.

1286
01:21:26,569 --> 01:21:29,925
lt<i>'</i>s not that. You just start...

1287
01:21:30,169 --> 01:21:33,002
...thinking about priorities.

1288
01:21:33,249 --> 01:21:37,686
How long can you discuss
physical fitness and the zodiac?

1289
01:21:38,169 --> 01:21:41,764
And this Michael character
was no bargain.

1290
01:21:41,969 --> 01:21:45,518
-How was Michael?
-l don<i>'</i>t know, he was sick.

1291
01:21:45,769 --> 01:21:50,206
l gave him a call and he did sound
very terrible.

1292
01:21:50,449 --> 01:21:53,805
l guess l really pulled the rug
out from under him.

1293
01:21:54,049 --> 01:21:57,200
Although his real crush is on Judy.

1294
01:21:57,449 --> 01:22:00,202
-Not to offend you, Gabe.
-l<i>'</i>m not.

1295
01:22:00,449 --> 01:22:03,282
l love it when someone likes Judy.

1296
01:22:03,529 --> 01:22:07,727
Gabe needs confirmation
of his feelings when it comes to me.

1297
01:22:08,009 --> 01:22:11,001
That<i>'</i>s a terrible thing to say.

1298
01:22:11,249 --> 01:22:13,479
l<i>'</i>d watch it if l were you, Gabe.

1299
01:22:13,729 --> 01:22:17,005
He always talks about Judy
in hushed tones.

1300
01:22:17,249 --> 01:22:21,481
l think those poems you wrote
impressed him.

1301
01:22:21,729 --> 01:22:24,801
Here<i>'</i>s to a good marriage.

1302
01:22:25,049 --> 01:22:28,598
-The best two people can hope for.
-Absolutely.

1303
01:22:41,449 --> 01:22:45,442
-l didn<i>'</i>t know about the poetry.
-l didn<i>'</i>t think you<i>'</i>d care.

1304
01:22:45,649 --> 01:22:48,117
-Well, why not?
-Because.

1305
01:22:48,649 --> 01:22:51,288
l<i>'</i>d be embarrassed
to show you my stuff.

1306
01:22:51,529 --> 01:22:54,282
-Why?
-You<i>'</i>re so hard on everything.

1307
01:22:54,529 --> 01:22:56,884
What are you talking about?

1308
01:22:57,089 --> 01:23:00,718
-You<i>'</i>re very, very judgmental.
-l like poetry.

1309
01:23:00,969 --> 01:23:05,087
l<i>'</i>m crazy about Shakespeare
and Byron and T.S. Eliot.

1310
01:23:05,329 --> 01:23:07,285
My stuff isn<i>'</i>t that good yet.

1311
01:23:07,529 --> 01:23:12,205
-l<i>'</i>d give an objective evaluation.
-l don<i>'</i>t want an objective evaluation.

1312
01:23:12,449 --> 01:23:16,124
l<i>'</i>d like something a little more
supportive and generous.

1313
01:23:16,369 --> 01:23:21,238
-From that character in your office?
-He<i>'</i>s not a character.

1314
01:23:21,449 --> 01:23:25,567
-Do you love him?
-No! Why, because l show him my poems?

1315
01:23:26,089 --> 01:23:29,320
-l saw Dr. Ritchie today.
-Oh, where?

1316
01:23:29,569 --> 01:23:32,003
l went back into psychotherapy.

1317
01:23:32,249 --> 01:23:36,162
You don<i>'</i>t need psychotherapy,
and certainly not with her!

1318
01:23:36,409 --> 01:23:39,287
Why? Because she<i>'</i>s postmodern?

1319
01:23:39,489 --> 01:23:43,482
Anyone who thinks the Sabine women
had it coming to them--

1320
01:23:43,689 --> 01:23:45,964
That<i>'</i>s not it.

1321
01:23:46,169 --> 01:23:48,478
-l don<i>'</i>t flirt.
-Don<i>'</i>t tell me that.

1322
01:23:48,729 --> 01:23:50,526
l<i>'</i>ve seen you do it.

1323
01:23:50,769 --> 01:23:53,124
You put on a different personality.

1324
01:23:53,369 --> 01:23:57,726
-You<i>'</i>re crazy.
-You pretend to want things you don<i>'</i>t.

1325
01:23:57,969 --> 01:23:59,687
-Like?
-Going to Europe.

1326
01:23:59,929 --> 01:24:04,525
That<i>'</i>s flirting. You couldn<i>'</i>t survive
off the island of Manhattan.

1327
01:24:04,769 --> 01:24:07,488
You misrepresented yourself to me.

1328
01:24:07,689 --> 01:24:09,327
What do you mean by that?

1329
01:24:09,569 --> 01:24:12,925
Like you had one child then
decided that was it.

1330
01:24:13,169 --> 01:24:18,880
-l<i>'</i>m not the same person l was.
-That<i>'</i>s why relationships go sour.

1331
01:24:19,129 --> 01:24:22,121
-You hate change.
-Change equals death.

1332
01:24:22,369 --> 01:24:24,360
Bullshit. That<i>'</i>s bullshit!

1333
01:24:24,569 --> 01:24:30,280
Maybe your students think it<i>'</i>s
insightful, but it means nothing.

1334
01:24:30,529 --> 01:24:32,326
Life is made of change.

1335
01:24:32,569 --> 01:24:35,561
lf you don<i>'</i>t change,
you just shrivel up.

1336
01:24:36,329 --> 01:24:40,163
l don<i>'</i>t want to.
You get sexual at the oddest times.

1337
01:24:41,569 --> 01:24:45,482
You use sex to express every
emotion but love.

1338
01:24:45,729 --> 01:24:48,118
You were attracted to me...

1339
01:24:48,369 --> 01:24:51,884
...because in some way,
l reminded you of Harriet.

1340
01:24:52,089 --> 01:24:54,319
But my sanity disappointed you.

1341
01:24:54,569 --> 01:24:58,482
l liked you because
you were decent and not crazy.

1342
01:24:58,689 --> 01:25:01,999
-And you found that too boring.
-No...

1343
01:25:02,249 --> 01:25:05,321
...as it turns out you were
as crazy as her.

1344
01:25:05,569 --> 01:25:09,118
-So l did remind you of Harriet.
-No...

1345
01:25:09,369 --> 01:25:12,202
...l had a feeling you
were unstable.

1346
01:25:12,409 --> 01:25:14,479
On the surface you were...

1347
01:25:14,689 --> 01:25:19,160
...but now that we<i>'</i>re having problems,
you<i>'</i>re not.

1348
01:25:19,369 --> 01:25:21,439
This is all very clear to me.

1349
01:25:21,929 --> 01:25:25,888
--we both couldn<i>'</i>t sleep one night,
remember...

1350
01:25:26,089 --> 01:25:30,287
...and we found <i>Wild Strawberries</i>
on cable...

1351
01:25:30,489 --> 01:25:35,722
...we stayed up all night watching it?
That was great.

1352
01:25:35,969 --> 01:25:40,918
We were going to the faculty dinner
and we were on Fifth Avenue...

1353
01:25:41,169 --> 01:25:45,082
...on an icy black night.
We were walking downtown.

1354
01:25:45,289 --> 01:25:48,281
Suddenly we decided not to go
to the dinner...

1355
01:25:48,529 --> 01:25:52,727
...it was such a beautiful night.
We walked into Central Park.

1356
01:25:52,969 --> 01:25:57,884
You could see every star. You were
so beautiful in that black dress.

1357
01:25:59,969 --> 01:26:03,518
-Don<i>'</i>t do that.
-Why not?

1358
01:26:03,769 --> 01:26:06,886
Because it<i>'</i>s over and we both know it.

1359
01:26:07,129 --> 01:26:08,528
Do we?

1360
01:26:08,769 --> 01:26:13,081
All that stuff--
Those memories, they<i>'</i>re just memories.

1361
01:26:13,289 --> 01:26:16,679
They<i>'</i>re from years gone by.

1362
01:26:16,929 --> 01:26:18,885
They<i>'</i>re isolated moments...

1363
01:26:19,089 --> 01:26:23,367
...they don<i>'</i>t tell the whole story.

1364
01:26:24,849 --> 01:26:28,888
<i>Several days later,</i>
<i>Gabe moved into a hotel.</i>

1365
01:26:29,969 --> 01:26:32,688
l wasn<i>'</i>t being totally honest
with Gabe.

1366
01:26:32,889 --> 01:26:37,087
Because l didn<i>'</i>t want to hurt him.
But l knew what l wanted.

1367
01:26:37,329 --> 01:26:41,402
l was in love with Michael.
l wanted to be free to...

1368
01:26:41,649 --> 01:26:47,645
...pursue that and not have to lie
or sneak around or anything.

1369
01:26:48,329 --> 01:26:51,321
How could l be 1 00% honest with Judy?

1370
01:26:51,569 --> 01:26:54,879
l loved her
and l didn<i>'</i>t want to hurt her.

1371
01:26:55,089 --> 01:26:57,319
What am l gonna say?

1372
01:26:57,569 --> 01:27:01,482
That l<i>'</i>m becoming infatuated
with a 20-year-old?

1373
01:27:01,729 --> 01:27:06,325
That l see myself sleepwalking
into a mess?

1374
01:27:06,569 --> 01:27:09,208
Then why didn<i>'</i>t you stop yourself?

1375
01:27:09,449 --> 01:27:13,920
There was something in my marriage
that l was not getting. Rain--

1376
01:27:14,169 --> 01:27:17,718
-There was excitement there.
-Rain had a boyfriend.

1377
01:27:17,969 --> 01:27:21,405
l know. Everything about
it was wrong.

1378
01:27:21,649 --> 01:27:24,607
That did not deter me.

1379
01:27:24,809 --> 01:27:29,121
lf anything, as usual,
there was something interesting.

1380
01:27:29,369 --> 01:27:34,079
So, what is it?
You have a self-destructive streak?

1381
01:27:34,289 --> 01:27:36,007
l don<i>'</i>t know.
My heart...

1382
01:27:36,209 --> 01:27:38,643
...does not know from logic.

1383
01:27:44,369 --> 01:27:45,768
Hello?

1384
01:27:45,969 --> 01:27:48,324
Oh, Michael, please.

1385
01:27:48,569 --> 01:27:51,720
l can<i>'</i>t keep discussing this.

1386
01:27:51,929 --> 01:27:57,162
lt was a decision l needed to make--
No. Wanted to make.

1387
01:27:57,489 --> 01:28:03,280
l said l<i>'</i>m sorry.
l can<i>'</i>t keep discussing this.

1388
01:28:04,569 --> 01:28:08,881
No. l don<i>'</i>t want to have a drink.
l have to go.

1389
01:28:09,249 --> 01:28:12,924
Well, you make it hard!
l have to go.

1390
01:28:13,889 --> 01:28:18,565
<i>Later, Judy helped Michael get</i>
<i>over the loss of Sally.</i>

1391
01:28:21,129 --> 01:28:22,482
Here we go.

1392
01:28:22,769 --> 01:28:24,999
-Heavens, Judy.
-Pretty good, huh?

1393
01:28:25,249 --> 01:28:28,082
That<i>'</i>s mine, where<i>'</i>s yours?

1394
01:28:28,289 --> 01:28:31,281
l am so happy that<i>'</i>s not true.

1395
01:28:33,969 --> 01:28:35,561
Thanks.

1396
01:28:37,329 --> 01:28:39,797
Right, shall l be mum?
Cheers.

1397
01:28:40,049 --> 01:28:42,688
-lt<i>'</i>s a real treat.
-You<i>'</i>re welcome.

1398
01:29:00,249 --> 01:29:04,765
-Where<i>'</i>s your wife?
-We<i>'</i>re not together anymore.

1399
01:29:04,969 --> 01:29:07,722
Oh, you writers. You<i>'</i>re so....

1400
01:29:07,969 --> 01:29:09,687
Happy birthday!

1401
01:29:10,529 --> 01:29:13,919
Did you meet that woman Jessica?

1402
01:29:14,169 --> 01:29:16,080
No, l met Angela, though.

1403
01:29:16,289 --> 01:29:18,598
-Did you see that?
-What?

1404
01:29:18,849 --> 01:29:22,000
lt<i>'</i>s incredible, this time of year.

1405
01:29:22,249 --> 01:29:24,809
Oh, l love storms.

1406
01:29:25,049 --> 01:29:29,281
They said we were supposed to
get some of that hurricane.

1407
01:29:29,489 --> 01:29:35,280
-lt<i>'</i>s really coming down heavy.
-How fitting. l was born in a storm.

1408
01:29:36,249 --> 01:29:38,444
lt<i>'</i>s dangerous.

1409
01:29:44,369 --> 01:29:45,927
She looks great.

1410
01:29:46,169 --> 01:29:49,923
She<i>'</i>s 21 !
lt<i>'</i>s absolutely incredible.

1411
01:29:50,169 --> 01:29:54,287
-Our littler Rainer.
-l<i>'</i>m gonna be 55.

1412
01:29:56,089 --> 01:29:59,843
lt<i>'</i>s our 25th wedding
anniversary in June.

1413
01:30:01,689 --> 01:30:04,920
Don<i>'</i>t worry.
We got some light in here for you.

1414
01:30:05,169 --> 01:30:07,080
l know l paid that bill.

1415
01:30:07,329 --> 01:30:09,889
Take some of these candles out there.

1416
01:30:22,449 --> 01:30:26,124
l can<i>'</i>t believe this.
l know l had a flashlight.

1417
01:30:26,369 --> 01:30:31,079
Oh, this is just my luck on my own
birthday. lt goes black.

1418
01:30:31,329 --> 01:30:34,480
You look very pretty in candlelight.

1419
01:30:35,529 --> 01:30:39,044
Oh, did you see the lightning flashes?

1420
01:30:39,249 --> 01:30:44,721
lt<i>'</i>s supposed to get worse. How<i>'</i>s
everybody gonna get home now?

1421
01:30:44,929 --> 01:30:46,123
Happy birthday.

1422
01:30:46,369 --> 01:30:50,965
l didn<i>'</i>t want to give it to
you in the other room because...

1423
01:30:51,169 --> 01:30:55,924
...it could be misconstrued, so...

1424
01:30:56,129 --> 01:31:00,884
-...l<i>'</i>ve been hiding it in my jacket.
-Very nice.

1425
01:31:05,569 --> 01:31:07,685
That<i>'</i>s lovely!

1426
01:31:08,489 --> 01:31:10,525
That is so pretty.

1427
01:31:10,769 --> 01:31:12,202
Happy birthday.

1428
01:31:12,409 --> 01:31:17,164
-Why would it be misconstrued?
-lt would just look funny.

1429
01:31:17,409 --> 01:31:20,321
Because you have a boyfriend.

1430
01:31:20,569 --> 01:31:22,560
People wouldn<i>'</i>t understand.

1431
01:31:22,809 --> 01:31:27,121
lt wouldn<i>'</i>t look funny at all.
lt<i>'</i>s beautiful.

1432
01:31:27,529 --> 01:31:32,683
-You know what l<i>'</i>d really like?
-What?

1433
01:31:33,649 --> 01:31:36,880
A nice birthday kiss.

1434
01:31:37,129 --> 01:31:39,882
-You want a birthday kiss?
-Yeah.

1435
01:31:42,849 --> 01:31:45,443
Happy birthday.

1436
01:31:45,889 --> 01:31:49,040
-That<i>'</i>s all?
-l<i>'</i>m drunk. This is not funny.

1437
01:31:49,289 --> 01:31:53,123
What do you mean?
That was a birthday kiss.

1438
01:31:53,369 --> 01:31:57,806
You want me to stick
my tongue down your throat?

1439
01:31:58,009 --> 01:32:00,477
Come on, you know what l mean.

1440
01:32:00,689 --> 01:32:03,601
You got a boyfriend in the other room.

1441
01:32:03,849 --> 01:32:07,319
l know. lt<i>'</i>s not serious.
lt isn<i>'</i>t serious.

1442
01:32:07,569 --> 01:32:10,481
Listen, l can<i>'</i>t even
have this conversation.

1443
01:32:10,689 --> 01:32:13,726
Not that l haven<i>'</i>t thought about it.

1444
01:32:13,969 --> 01:32:16,722
l have, but it<i>'</i>s just too crazy. l--

1445
01:32:16,969 --> 01:32:19,927
lt<i>'</i>s so disappointing.

1446
01:32:20,169 --> 01:32:23,286
lt isn<i>'</i>t disappointing.
You got a boyfriend.

1447
01:32:23,529 --> 01:32:26,885
You couldn<i>'</i>t ask for a
more romantic moment.

1448
01:32:27,129 --> 01:32:30,087
l mean, it<i>'</i>s my 21 st birthday, and...

1449
01:32:30,289 --> 01:32:33,918
...we<i>'</i>re in a storm,
the lights are out and there<i>'</i>s...

1450
01:32:34,169 --> 01:32:38,959
-...the rain sweeping the skyline.
-Why do l hear...

1451
01:32:39,209 --> 01:32:42,326
...$50,000 worth of psychotherapy...

1452
01:32:42,569 --> 01:32:45,720
-...dialling 91 1 now?
-lt<i>'</i>s magical. l<i>'</i>m sorry.

1453
01:32:45,929 --> 01:32:49,717
l<i>'</i>m sorry. l<i>'</i>ve had a
little too much to drink too.

1454
01:32:49,969 --> 01:32:52,847
-Me too. l had....
-l<i>'</i>m just....

1455
01:32:53,049 --> 01:32:57,565
You want to kiss?
l mean, you want a real kiss?

1456
01:32:57,889 --> 01:33:01,086
You want an actual,
professional kiss?

1457
01:33:01,289 --> 01:33:03,723
-Yes.
-Both lips, upper and lower.

1458
01:33:03,969 --> 01:33:06,722
-At once?
-l<i>'</i>ve thought about it.

1459
01:33:06,929 --> 01:33:10,683
-l gotta tell you.
-Come here.

1460
01:33:27,849 --> 01:33:32,206
l was just hoping that lightning
can<i>'</i>t come into a penthouse...

1461
01:33:32,449 --> 01:33:37,000
...because it was tumultuous outside.
lt was crashing all around and...

1462
01:33:37,249 --> 01:33:41,288
...the scene had to be played.
l mean, l was...

1463
01:33:41,529 --> 01:33:44,521
...l wanted to kiss her,
it was pouring...

1464
01:33:44,769 --> 01:33:48,205
...but l figured,
any second the lightning...

1465
01:33:48,449 --> 01:33:51,885
...would come right
into the apartment and...

1466
01:33:52,129 --> 01:33:54,199
...and that l would die.

1467
01:33:54,449 --> 01:33:58,886
l don<i>'</i>t want to spend Sunday together,
because l need time alone!

1468
01:33:59,089 --> 01:34:03,526
-Be alone! l<i>'</i>m not pushing you.
-Yes. Yes, you are, in that...

1469
01:34:03,769 --> 01:34:08,320
...quiet, steady way of yours.
<i>''</i>Supportive,<i>''</i> is your word.

1470
01:34:08,569 --> 01:34:11,766
<i>''</i> Understanding.<i>''</i>
Stop being so understanding.

1471
01:34:11,969 --> 01:34:15,325
l still have feelings for Sally.

1472
01:34:15,569 --> 01:34:18,925
Feelings l don<i>'</i>t think
l could ever have for you.

1473
01:34:19,169 --> 01:34:22,605
Oh, God! Where are you--?
Oh, for--

1474
01:34:23,889 --> 01:34:26,926
-l<i>'</i>m sorry.
-l never want to see you again!

1475
01:34:27,169 --> 01:34:30,320
-l need you.
-lt<i>'</i>s good to know how you feel.

1476
01:34:30,569 --> 01:34:32,287
l<i>'</i>m glad to know.

1477
01:34:32,529 --> 01:34:35,362
-You are so self-centred!
-l know.

1478
01:34:35,649 --> 01:34:37,526
l didn<i>'</i>t mean those things.

1479
01:34:37,769 --> 01:34:40,602
-Why did you say them?
-l<i>'</i>m confused.

1480
01:34:40,849 --> 01:34:44,603
-l never want to hurt you.
-Bullshit!

1481
01:34:44,809 --> 01:34:49,883
lt<i>'</i>s not bullshit. l don<i>'</i>t
deserve you. l<i>'</i>m sorry. Please!

1482
01:34:57,449 --> 01:35:00,282
-Did you shut the windows?
-l was thinking...

1483
01:35:00,489 --> 01:35:05,483
...it<i>'</i>s a good thing we fixed
that leak in the den.

1484
01:35:06,129 --> 01:35:11,487
Even now l<i>'</i>m still scared of thunder.
Any loud noise.

1485
01:35:11,729 --> 01:35:16,280
We would have been nuts to
use those theatre tickets.

1486
01:35:16,489 --> 01:35:19,322
We<i>'</i>d have been swerving all over.

1487
01:35:19,569 --> 01:35:22,288
-l<i>'</i>m glad we stayed home.
-Me too.

1488
01:35:25,369 --> 01:35:30,079
When we were apart,
this storm would have terrified me.

1489
01:35:30,289 --> 01:35:33,486
l was scared enough sleeping alone.

1490
01:35:33,689 --> 01:35:38,080
Sometimes you can be alone
when you<i>'</i>re with someone.

1491
01:35:44,889 --> 01:35:49,280
Should we have given those
other tickets to Gabe or Judy?

1492
01:35:49,489 --> 01:35:53,562
-We did buy them for them.
-Yeah, l know, but...

1493
01:35:53,809 --> 01:35:57,882
...the situation<i>'</i>s
completely different now.

1494
01:36:03,529 --> 01:36:06,407
<i>A year and a half later,</i>
<i>much had occurred.</i>

1495
01:36:06,689 --> 01:36:08,566
<i>Judy was married to Michael.</i>

1496
01:36:09,049 --> 01:36:11,085
-So, you happy?
-Go ahead.

1497
01:36:13,369 --> 01:36:16,406
Yes, l think things have
gone pretty smoothly.

1498
01:36:16,649 --> 01:36:22,201
-He puts up with my idiosyncrasies.
-No, she puts up with mine.

1499
01:36:22,409 --> 01:36:26,880
She<i>'</i>s passive-aggressive.
Somehow, she gets what she wants.

1500
01:36:27,089 --> 01:36:30,081
She wanted me, she wanted Gabe...

1501
01:36:30,329 --> 01:36:34,322
...she wanted the job at the magazine,
out of her marriages...

1502
01:36:34,569 --> 01:36:37,003
...she wants Michael....

1503
01:36:38,369 --> 01:36:40,519
l disagree.

1504
01:36:40,769 --> 01:36:43,806
When Sally went back to Jack,
l went after Judy.

1505
01:36:44,049 --> 01:36:48,520
Not at first, but when l
decided, l went after her.

1506
01:36:48,729 --> 01:36:54,087
Gee, l hope l didn<i>'</i>t push.
l wanted it to work, it<i>'</i>s true.

1507
01:36:54,369 --> 01:36:57,964
We<i>'</i>re doing fine. Really.
We<i>'</i>ve learned to...

1508
01:36:58,209 --> 01:37:01,599
...tolerate our problems more.
Don<i>'</i>t you think?

1509
01:37:01,849 --> 01:37:05,000
l<i>'</i>ve learned, anyway, that love is...

1510
01:37:05,249 --> 01:37:09,481
...not about passion and
romance necessarily.

1511
01:37:09,689 --> 01:37:13,682
lt<i>'</i>s also about companionship and...

1512
01:37:13,929 --> 01:37:17,319
...it<i>'</i>s like a buffer against
loneliness, l think.

1513
01:37:17,569 --> 01:37:22,279
That stuff is important.
Somebody to grow old with.

1514
01:37:22,489 --> 01:37:26,482
What kills most people is
unreal expectations.

1515
01:37:26,729 --> 01:37:29,607
What about things that
can<i>'</i>t be talked about?

1516
01:37:29,849 --> 01:37:33,080
Like sexual problems, for instance.

1517
01:37:33,289 --> 01:37:36,486
-Unresolved.
-Unresolved?

1518
01:37:39,929 --> 01:37:43,524
Well, there<i>'</i>s some things you
can<i>'</i>t solve and then...

1519
01:37:43,769 --> 01:37:45,680
...you have to live with it.

1520
01:37:45,889 --> 01:37:49,518
You construct some
kind of patchwork thing.

1521
01:37:49,769 --> 01:37:54,001
-But sometimes they flare up.
-They do, and when it happens...

1522
01:37:54,249 --> 01:37:56,888
...it gets tough when that happens.

1523
01:37:57,129 --> 01:38:01,281
You learn to deal with it and then
push it under the rug.

1524
01:38:01,529 --> 01:38:05,408
And it works. That<i>'</i>s the weird thing.
lt<i>'</i>s not bad.

1525
01:38:05,649 --> 01:38:09,608
You can<i>'</i>t force yourself to
conform to some abstract...

1526
01:38:09,849 --> 01:38:12,409
...vision of love, or...

1527
01:38:12,609 --> 01:38:16,363
...you know, marriage.
Every situation<i>'</i>s different.

1528
01:38:16,609 --> 01:38:18,998
Whatever works is the deal.

1529
01:38:19,249 --> 01:38:21,479
Ours is just one way.

1530
01:38:21,729 --> 01:38:26,325
lt<i>'</i>s funny. Last year when
we were at Gabe and Judy<i>'</i>s...

1531
01:38:26,569 --> 01:38:30,118
...and we announced so flippantly
we were splitting....

1532
01:38:30,369 --> 01:38:33,600
-l wasn<i>'</i>t that confident.
-l wasn<i>'</i>t either.

1533
01:38:33,849 --> 01:38:36,966
l remember thinking
they were so lucky.

1534
01:38:37,209 --> 01:38:39,598
They had such a great marriage.

1535
01:38:39,849 --> 01:38:43,205
lt<i>'</i>s ironic that we<i>'</i>re
together and they aren<i>'</i>t.

1536
01:38:43,449 --> 01:38:45,917
-Yeah.
-Weird.

1537
01:38:46,369 --> 01:38:48,360
l had a romantic moment...

1538
01:38:48,609 --> 01:38:52,887
...with Rain at her
21 st birthday party...

1539
01:38:53,129 --> 01:38:57,281
...and l could feel
the old pull coming back.

1540
01:38:57,569 --> 01:39:01,403
<i>The old attraction coming back.</i>
<i>Feelings I'd had...</i>

1541
01:39:01,649 --> 01:39:05,483
<i>... from my past.</i>
<i>It was very vivid to me.</i>

1542
01:39:10,289 --> 01:39:12,803
That was a-- That was a...

1543
01:39:13,049 --> 01:39:16,724
...a great moment.
l don<i>'</i>t really think we should...

1544
01:39:16,969 --> 01:39:19,164
...follow up on it.

1545
01:39:19,529 --> 01:39:22,885
What do you--?
What do you mean?

1546
01:39:23,129 --> 01:39:27,281
Well, you know, l just....
lf things were different--

1547
01:39:27,489 --> 01:39:31,118
lf l was younger,
or if you were older...

1548
01:39:31,369 --> 01:39:34,122
...or anything different,
but somehow...

1549
01:39:34,369 --> 01:39:38,487
...l just feel l know how
this is gonna come out.

1550
01:39:40,489 --> 01:39:41,888
You sure?

1551
01:39:43,529 --> 01:39:47,568
l am. You know, l really am.

1552
01:40:02,769 --> 01:40:05,886
l knew how it would end.

1553
01:40:08,209 --> 01:40:12,680
And l left and l walked out
into the pouring rain.

1554
01:40:13,809 --> 01:40:17,484
l just headed instinctively
back to my apartment...

1555
01:40:17,689 --> 01:40:21,079
...because l wanted to hold Judy
and kiss her...

1556
01:40:21,329 --> 01:40:24,127
...and say things to her, and then...

1557
01:40:24,369 --> 01:40:28,601
...then l realized that, you know,
l really blew it.

1558
01:40:28,929 --> 01:40:31,682
So, what<i>'</i>s your life like now?

1559
01:40:32,649 --> 01:40:37,723
l<i>'</i>m out of the race for now.
l don<i>'</i>t want to get involved.

1560
01:40:37,929 --> 01:40:42,207
l don<i>'</i>t want to hurt anyone.
l don<i>'</i>t want to get hurt.

1561
01:40:42,449 --> 01:40:46,078
l don<i>'</i>t mind living by
myself and working.

1562
01:40:46,289 --> 01:40:48,120
lt<i>'</i>s temporary.

1563
01:40:48,369 --> 01:40:52,487
l<i>'</i>ll have the urge to get back
into the swing of things.

1564
01:40:52,689 --> 01:40:55,408
That seems to be how it goes.

1565
01:40:55,649 --> 01:40:59,085
l<i>'</i>m writing, l<i>'</i>m working on a...

1566
01:40:59,329 --> 01:41:04,084
...a new novel. Not the old
one anymore, and, um...

1567
01:41:04,369 --> 01:41:06,929
-...it<i>'</i>s fine.
-ls it different?

1568
01:41:07,169 --> 01:41:12,766
My novel? Yes, it<i>'</i>s less
confessional, more political.

1569
01:41:15,449 --> 01:41:17,679
Can l go? ls this over?
