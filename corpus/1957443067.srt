- You're out, girl. You're out.

Could security... Somebody please
escort her to her vehicle?

220
00:10:47,523 --> 00:10:49,491
It's a little unnecessary,
don't you think?

221
00:10:49,525 --> 00:10:52,127
Ma'am, we were specifically told
to eject you off the premises.

222
00:10:52,161 --> 00:10:54,063
Do I look like
a threat to security?

223

Yes, you are.

224

back in drugs, back in rehab.

Why is she naked?

239

Um, we're just
getting into character.

240
00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:10,572
Greg needs to adjust
my skin tone

241
00:12:10,606 --> 00:12:12,074
so there's no shine.

242
00:12:12,107 --> 00:12:13,609
You need

Where's Tim?
I thought he was directing.

244
00:12:15,310 --> 00:12:17,179
He was needed
at the deli shop today,

245
00:12:17,212 --> 00:12:19,181
so I'm directing this,

246
00:12:19,214 --> 00:12:21,150
and acting in it, obviously,

247
00:12:21,183 --> 00:12:23,585
and doing the lighting.

248
00:12:23,619 --> 00:12:25,722
I thought you were
on the Kawalsky shoot today.

249
00:12:25,755 --> 00:12:27,356
Yeah, well. I got fired.

250
00:12:27,389 --> 00:12:29,358
Fired? What do you mean?

251
00:12:29,391 --> 00:12:31,960
I mean I got kicked off set
and told never to come back,

252
00:12:31,994 --> 00:12:33,662
that kind of fired.

253
00:12:33,696 --> 00:12:35,597
Ah!

254
00:12:35,631 --> 00:12:38,033
Greg? Can we shoot this?

255
00:12:38,066 --> 00:12:40,402
Oh, yeah. Sure.

256
00:12:40,436 --> 00:12:42,404
Sorry, we only have today
to shoot this,

Well, it's a speaking part,
so it's pretty big.

extra hours at the takeout.

Oh, and my car's
broken down again.

- Yeah. Yeah, sure.

- And light.

00:17:02,031 --> 00:17:04,433
That's you and Isabella Andrews?

342
00:17:04,466 --> 00:17:07,369
- Uh-huh.
- Oh, my God!

343
00:17:07,402 --> 00:17:11,606
- You and Ethan Burns!
- Yup.

344
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:13,375
- Ye... Oh!
- [phone ringing]

345
00:17:14,576 --> 00:17:15,812
Hey, babe.

346
00:17:15,845 --> 00:17:17,814
You were supposed to pick me up.

347
00:17:17,847 --> 00:17:20,515
Really?
I guess I must have forgot.

348
00:17:20,549 --> 00:17:22,484
[chuckling]

349
00:17:22,517 --> 00:17:23,820
What the hell is going on?

350
00:17:24,754 --> 00:17:26,521
Oh, yeah!

351
00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:29,726
Greg, are you sleeping with her?

352
00:17:31,027 --> 00:17:33,029
<i>Are you?</i>

353
00:17:33,062 --> 00:17:35,732
Well, you see, babe...

354
00:17:35,765 --> 00:17:37,967
I want to actually know.
Are you sleeping with her?

355
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,267
Tell me.

356
00:17:40,036 --> 00:17:41,236
Yeah.

357
00:17:41,603 --> 00:17:42,504
How long?

358
00:17:44,006 --> 00:17:45,908
How long has this been going on?

359
00:17:45,942 --> 00:17:47,977
Hey, look.

360
00:17:48,010 --> 00:17:50,278
I have to do this, okay?

361
00:17:50,312 --> 00:17:51,848
Her career's kinda blowing up.

362
00:17:51,881 --> 00:17:53,415
What?

363
00:17:53,448 --> 00:17:54,917
<i>She can help me
get a good agent.</i>

364
00:17:54,951 --> 00:17:57,552
And then I can get that agent
to sign you too.

365
00:17:58,386 --> 00:18:00,589
I'm not hearing this.

366
00:18:02,524 --> 00:18:04,794
Hey, I'm doing this for you,
okay?

367
00:18:04,827 --> 00:18:06,528
<i>For your career.</i>

368
00:18:06,561 --> 00:18:09,664
You're cheating with some slut
to help my career.

369
00:18:09,699 --> 00:18:12,367
This is just the way
the industry operates.

370
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,936
It's called networking.

371
00:18:14,369 --> 00:18:16,304
Go fuck yourself.

372
00:18:16,338 --> 00:18:18,373
- [line dead signal]
- Hello?

373
00:18:21,409 --> 00:18:22,310
Whatever.

377
00:18:45,067 --> 00:18:46,803
Don't scare me, Harold.

378
00:18:46,836 --> 00:18:50,807
Collecting the rent
like the Yanks.

379
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:54,509
Just joking. Just on my way
to show you my latest purchase.

380
00:18:54,543 --> 00:18:57,780
This is the actual pistol
used in the classic 1971 movie,

381
00:18:57,814 --> 00:18:59,682
- <i>Dirty Harry.</i>
- Oh!

382
00:18:59,715 --> 00:19:01,483
- Cool.
- Very cool.

383
00:19:01,516 --> 00:19:04,854
Yeah, uh.
Car's broken down again.

384
00:19:04,887 --> 00:19:06,454
Can you come with me
to the tow yard tomorrow

385
00:19:06,488 --> 00:19:07,790
- to pick it up?
- Of course.

386
00:19:07,824 --> 00:19:08,858
And I'll pay you back,
of course.

387
00:19:08,891 --> 00:19:09,992
- No, no, no.
- I'll have the rent

388
00:19:10,026 --> 00:19:11,359
by Wednesday, I promise.

389
00:19:11,393 --> 00:19:13,461
- I'm so sorry.
- No worries.

390
00:19:13,495 --> 00:19:15,430
Get some rest.
Give me a knock in the morning.

391
00:19:15,463 --> 00:19:17,465
- All good.
- Thanks. Thank you.

392
00:19:17,499 --> 00:19:18,835
- Good night, dear.
- Good night.

[radio announcer]

394
00:19:26,108 --> 00:19:28,610

all those aspiring actors</i>

395
00:19:28,643 --> 00:19:30,412
<i>who work tables
to bring us our coffee.</i>

396
00:19:30,445 --> 00:19:31,948
Thanks for helping me out
with the car.

397
00:19:31,981 --> 00:19:34,750
- I'll pay you back.
- Nonsense. It's my pleasure.

398
00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:37,385
Let me at least
take you out to dinner.

399
00:19:37,419 --> 00:19:38,955
Jodes, I'm your landlord,

400
00:19:38,988 --> 00:19:40,522
and you're a starving
crew member.

401
00:19:40,555 --> 00:19:41,924
I will take you to dinner.

402
00:19:41,958 --> 00:19:43,860
Well, I'm not any more.

403
00:19:43,893 --> 00:19:46,696
I got fired from
Zac Kawalsky's movie.

404
00:19:46,729 --> 00:19:49,131
- Well, thank God for that.
- Why?

405
00:19:49,165 --> 00:19:51,067
Because Zac Kawalsky's
a complete idiot.

406
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:53,102
Who has won two Golden Globes.

407
00:19:53,135 --> 00:19:55,570
He hasn't won two Golden Globes.

408
00:19:55,604 --> 00:19:58,640
Harold, you just don't like
any contemporary movies.

409
00:19:58,673 --> 00:20:01,677
You don't like any modern-day
directors or actors.

410
00:20:01,711 --> 00:20:04,546
I mean, the other night you were
having a go at Ethan Burns.

411
00:20:04,579 --> 00:20:05,915
'Cause Ethan Burns is a hack.

412
00:20:05,948 --> 00:20:07,783
He's not a hack,
he's incredible.

413
00:20:07,817 --> 00:20:10,452
And he performed his own stunts
in <i>Nightfire,</i> too.

414
00:20:10,485 --> 00:20:12,688
He's not performed
his own stunts. He's a hack.

415
00:20:12,722 --> 00:20:15,024
And another hack performed
his stunts for him.

416
00:20:15,057 --> 00:20:17,927
Yeah, I saw an interview with
Ethan Burns where he admits

417
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:20,562
that he never lets anyone else
do his stunts for him.

418
00:20:20,595 --> 00:20:22,497
He lets me do his...

419
00:20:22,530 --> 00:20:24,934
Shouldn't you be on Hollywood
Boulevard, Christopher Reeve?

420
00:20:24,967 --> 00:20:26,802
I'm Henry Cavill, asshole.

421
00:20:26,836 --> 00:20:28,436
Oh.

422
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:29,504
Carry on.

423
00:20:31,874 --> 00:20:34,442
Perhaps give me a haircut.

424
00:20:34,476 --> 00:20:35,778
If just... Okay.

425
00:20:39,815 --> 00:20:43,219
We're gonna talk bad movies,
let's talk <i>Born in Vegas.</i>

426
00:20:43,252 --> 00:20:46,856
Oh. <i>Born in Vega</i> this,
you're onto something.

427
00:20:46,889 --> 00:20:48,590
<i>Born in Vegas,</i> officially
the worst movie ever made.

428
00:20:48,623 --> 00:20:50,226
With the worst actors
in Hollywood.

429
00:20:50,259 --> 00:20:52,594
- Yes.
- Hi.

430
00:20:52,627 --> 00:20:54,496
- Hi.
- Would you like to order?

431
00:20:54,529 --> 00:20:55,932
Have you seen <i>Malcolm X?</i>

432
00:20:55,965 --> 00:20:57,800
[chuckles] No.

433
00:20:59,668 --> 00:21:01,603
I'll have the veggie burger.

434
00:21:02,238 --> 00:21:05,074
You really should see it.
It's quite a lovely film.

435
00:21:05,107 --> 00:21:06,709
Would you guys like
for me to come back?

436
00:21:06,742 --> 00:21:08,711
No, no, no, no. I...

437
00:21:08,744 --> 00:21:10,880
I'll do soup.

438
00:21:10,913 --> 00:21:12,982
Denzel Washington
is just brilliant.

439
00:21:13,015 --> 00:21:15,051
I mean, every angle.

440
00:21:15,084 --> 00:21:17,219
Right.
Well, I'll be sure to catch it.

441
00:21:17,253 --> 00:21:19,654
Yes, indeed.

442
00:21:19,689 --> 00:21:22,524
When are you going to realize
not every Black person

443
00:21:22,557 --> 00:21:25,527
wants to talk about <i>Malcolm X?</i>
Not every Native American

444
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:27,263
wants to talk
about <i>Dances with Wolves,</i>

445
00:21:27,296 --> 00:21:29,564
and not every Jewish person
wants to hear

446
00:21:29,597 --> 00:21:33,069
about your screenplay where you
believe Moses was assassinated.

447
00:21:33,102 --> 00:21:35,271
He was assassinated.
And by the way,

448
00:21:35,304 --> 00:21:36,638
I've got the title.

449
00:21:36,671 --> 00:21:38,741
You mean you stopped researching

450
00:21:38,774 --> 00:21:40,743
and have actually
started writing?

451
00:21:40,776 --> 00:21:41,811
No.

452
00:21:43,079 --> 00:21:44,146
Just the title.

00:21:45,881 --> 00:21:47,083

That is a terrible title,
Harold.

456
00:21:51,854 --> 00:21:53,189
I don't see why.

457
00:21:53,222 --> 00:21:55,157
Hollywood needs to start
telling the truth

458
00:21:55,191 --> 00:21:56,993
in all its brutality.
They need to stop

459
00:21:57,026 --> 00:21:59,996
portraying everything
as a sappy romance.

460
00:22:00,029 --> 00:22:01,596
All right?
Take that awful Amish movie.

461
00:22:01,629 --> 00:22:03,065
They never want
to bring in the fact

462
00:22:03,099 --> 00:22:04,767
that the Amish
sleep with their siblings.

463
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:08,270
They sleep with their...
Brothers and sisters sleep...

464
00:22:08,304 --> 00:22:11,639
The Amish.
They sleep with their sisters.

Yes?

Hi. Um...

471
00:23:23,879 --> 00:23:27,883
I have an appointment
with Grant Garino.

472
00:23:27,917 --> 00:23:29,685
He knows me.
I met him last week.

473
00:23:29,718 --> 00:23:32,021
- He told me to stop by.
- I remember you

474
00:23:32,054 --> 00:23:34,190
from the last time
that you were here,

475
00:23:34,223 --> 00:23:36,859
and if you don't leave right
now, I'm calling security.

476
00:23:38,961 --> 00:23:41,063
[softly] Please.

477
00:23:41,097 --> 00:23:42,998
I just need a shot at this.

478
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:45,367
Please, just...

479
00:23:48,070 --> 00:23:49,205
Please.

480
00:23:49,738 --> 00:23:51,073
Come on.

481
00:23:51,107 --> 00:23:52,674
This is real unnecessary,
you know...

482
00:23:52,708 --> 00:23:54,076
You know you're not supposed
to be here.

483
00:23:54,110 --> 00:23:56,879
I don't need escorting out.
It's like...

484
00:23:56,912 --> 00:23:58,347
I can go where I want.

485
00:24:07,256 --> 00:24:10,092

Shit!

488
00:24:14,763 --> 00:24:16,398
Okay. All right. Calm down, Zac.

489
00:24:16,432 --> 00:24:18,801
Calm down. No one was hurt.
No one was hurt.

490
00:24:21,036 --> 00:24:22,171
Oh, shit!

491
00:24:32,781 --> 00:24:34,350
- The hell are you doing?
- What the hell are you doing?

492
00:24:34,383 --> 00:24:36,452
You're supposed to wait for me
to pull out.

493
00:24:36,485 --> 00:24:38,220
- Oh, it's you.
- Great!

495
00:24:40,256 --> 00:24:42,358
Listen, let's not deal with the
insurance companies, all right?

496
00:24:42,391 --> 00:24:44,193
They can be a real
big pain in the ass.

497
00:24:44,226 --> 00:24:46,061
Just let me take care of it.

498
00:24:46,095 --> 00:24:48,831
- What's your name?
- Jodea Maxwell.

499
00:24:48,864 --> 00:24:51,000
- Are you okay?
- Oh, I'm just fine.

500
00:24:51,033 --> 00:24:54,069
Aside from the fact I got
unjustifiably fired from my job,

501
00:24:54,103 --> 00:24:55,437
broke up
with my cheating boyfriend,

502
00:24:55,471 --> 00:24:57,406
got publicly escorted out of ICA

503
00:24:57,439 --> 00:24:59,742
and now I'm without a car, but
aside from that, I'm just fine.

504
00:24:59,775 --> 00:25:01,443
Thanks for asking.

505
00:25:01,477 --> 00:25:03,812
Listen, I'm sorry I fired you.
We were on a deadline, okay?

506
00:25:03,846 --> 00:25:05,181
Okay. You were on a deadline.

507
00:25:06,182 --> 00:25:07,950
How's Isabella?

508
00:25:07,983 --> 00:25:09,885
- Huh?
- Your wife?

509
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:11,287
She broke her nose?

510
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:12,788
Oh, yeah, yeah. She's fine.

511
00:25:12,821 --> 00:25:14,156
Listen, I gotta go, okay?

512
00:25:28,938 --> 00:25:29,972
Shit!

513
00:25:35,177 --> 00:25:36,345
Hey! You can't do that.

514
00:25:37,479 --> 00:25:39,148
Lois, we got a runner.

515
00:25:41,917 --> 00:25:44,119
It's not addressed to me.
It's addressed to Jodi Maxwell.

516
00:25:44,153 --> 00:25:47,189
Mr. Kawalsky owes me money.
He drove into my car.

517
00:25:47,223 --> 00:25:48,090
He spelled my name wrong.

518
00:25:49,191 --> 00:25:51,126
This is your first film
in years.

519
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:54,296
The public will crucify it
without seeing it first.

520
00:25:56,332 --> 00:25:59,268
Are you saying I can't sell
a film on my own?

521
00:25:59,301 --> 00:26:01,837
Three years ago
you were in rehab.

522
00:26:01,870 --> 00:26:04,440
The only reason
you are where you are now

523
00:26:04,473 --> 00:26:06,408
is thanks to Isabella,

524
00:26:06,442 --> 00:26:07,910
and me, of course.

525
00:26:07,943 --> 00:26:10,312
Gee. Thanks, Grant.
Thanks a lot.

526
00:26:10,346 --> 00:26:13,515
All I'm saying is,
just release the movie

527
00:26:13,549 --> 00:26:16,051
and then go through
with the divorce.

528
00:26:16,652 --> 00:26:19,421
I am not waiting that long
to end this shit.

529
00:26:19,455 --> 00:26:21,991
Remember the last time
you didn't take my advice?

530
00:26:22,024 --> 00:26:24,159
Huh? You released the film

531
00:26:24,193 --> 00:26:27,429
at the time
of the Craig Sheeran incident.

532
00:26:27,463 --> 00:26:30,933
We lost millions
at the box office. Remember?

533
00:26:30,966 --> 00:26:33,936
No. I don't remember.
I must have forgot.

534
00:26:33,969 --> 00:26:35,938
Thank you for reminding me.

535
00:26:36,772 --> 00:26:40,409
Look.
Let's just finish this movie.

536
00:26:40,442 --> 00:26:43,545
The damn things on hold
and it's costing us a fortune.

537
00:26:43,579 --> 00:26:45,214
Well, it's not my fault

538
00:26:45,247 --> 00:26:47,416
the leading asshole
is banging my wife,

539
00:26:47,449 --> 00:26:50,452
and decided to break her nose
in the process.

540
00:26:50,486 --> 00:26:52,187
Let's move on.

541
00:26:54,156 --> 00:26:56,892
Where are you with cutting
the Nicole character?

542
00:26:56,925 --> 00:26:58,894
We are not cutting
the Nicole character.

543
00:26:58,927 --> 00:27:01,430
I thought
I was very clear on that.

544
00:27:01,463 --> 00:27:03,832
I wanna talk Ethan Burns
with you.

545
00:27:03,866 --> 00:27:06,035
If you get Ethan Burns for me,

546
00:27:06,068 --> 00:27:08,337
the movie's a hit,
my career is back.

547
00:27:10,906 --> 00:27:13,175
I wanna know why Ethan
doesn't wanna work with me.

548
00:27:13,777 --> 00:27:17,046
- Zac.
- No, seriously. I wanna know.

549
00:27:17,579 --> 00:27:20,082
There's really no easy way
of saying this,

550
00:27:20,115 --> 00:27:23,252
but Ethan's heard all the rumors
about the drug abuse

551
00:27:23,285 --> 00:27:24,620
and he doesn't want
any part of it.

552
00:27:24,653 --> 00:27:27,289
Jesus, Grant!
You're my agent, too.

553
00:27:27,323 --> 00:27:28,524
Tell him how good I am,

554
00:27:28,557 --> 00:27:30,626
or how great it is
to work with me.

555
00:27:30,659 --> 00:27:33,228
I need to know
you can do this first.

556
00:27:41,236 --> 00:27:43,272
You didn't even ask him,
did you?

557
00:27:43,773 --> 00:27:46,542
I can't take that risk of losing
Ethan as a client.

558
00:27:46,575 --> 00:27:48,177
How long have we known
each other?

559
00:27:48,577 --> 00:27:51,547
For like ten years. And this
is how you show your loyalty?

560
00:27:53,015 --> 00:27:55,017
Hollywood's
not about loyalty, Zac.

561
00:27:55,050 --> 00:27:56,552
I'm just gonna take this

562
00:27:56,585 --> 00:27:58,287
and give this to Mr. Kawalsky
when he comes out.

563
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:00,055
- Like hell you will.
- Excuse me!

564
00:28:00,989 --> 00:28:03,258
So who are we gonna get
for the Nicole character?

565
00:28:04,593 --> 00:28:07,296
Isabella was adamant
about cutting that role.

566
00:28:07,329 --> 00:28:11,200
I am done with her, okay?
You work for me, remember?

567
00:28:11,233 --> 00:28:14,403
Let me see who you have in your
books for the Nicole character.

568
00:28:16,105 --> 00:28:17,906
Well, this is
one of my favorites.

569
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:20,542
Here's... Britney!

570
00:28:20,576 --> 00:28:22,177
- No.
- Oh, come on.

571
00:28:22,211 --> 00:28:23,545
- No.
- And then there's Gaby.

572
00:28:23,579 --> 00:28:24,646
No.

573
00:28:24,681 --> 00:28:27,249
- We've got Olivia.
- No.

574
00:28:27,282 --> 00:28:28,617
- Zac!
- No, no, no.

575
00:28:28,650 --> 00:28:30,552
These are all
up-and-coming TV stars.

576
00:28:30,586 --> 00:28:34,156
I don't want some fake-breasted
soap opera bimbo, okay? I...

577
00:28:36,658 --> 00:28:39,294
[soft tense music]

578
00:28:43,332 --> 00:28:45,167
I want an unknown for this role.

579
00:28:47,704 --> 00:28:49,204
Someone real.

580
00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:53,041
Unknowns don't sell, Zac.

581
00:28:53,843 --> 00:28:55,944
I've always been best
with unknowns.

582
00:28:55,978 --> 00:28:57,446
I can take any actress
off the street,

583
00:28:57,479 --> 00:28:59,281
and I'll make them a star.

584
00:28:59,314 --> 00:29:00,215
I'll do it!

585
00:29:01,450 --> 00:29:03,385
[panting] I'll do it.

586
00:29:04,119 --> 00:29:07,389
Women, as always,
tend to fall in my arms.

587
00:29:07,423 --> 00:29:09,291
Lois!
You know you're not supposed

588
00:29:09,324 --> 00:29:11,427
to let anybody in here
without calling ahead.

589
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:14,329
Sorry, Mr. Garino.
She just charged in.

590
00:29:14,363 --> 00:29:16,532
No. Just wait!

591
00:29:16,565 --> 00:29:18,300
- You got my name wrong.
- What the hell!

592
00:29:18,333 --> 00:29:19,435
Who is this?

593
00:29:20,035 --> 00:29:22,538
I've been thinking.
You know, uh,

594
00:29:22,571 --> 00:29:24,273
I can take care
of the damage to my car,

595
00:29:24,306 --> 00:29:25,541
which I shouldn't be doing

596
00:29:25,574 --> 00:29:28,343
because it was kinda your fault,

597
00:29:28,377 --> 00:29:31,213
but how about we come
to an arrangement?

598
00:29:31,246 --> 00:29:35,250
I'll take care of the damage,
and you put me in your film.

599
00:29:38,287 --> 00:29:41,089
- You said you wanted an unknown.
- I don't believe this.

600
00:29:41,123 --> 00:29:43,292
I don't fucking believe this.

601
00:29:43,325 --> 00:29:44,393
- Ah, Lois.
- Wait.

602
00:29:44,426 --> 00:29:45,695
Lois, just, um...

603
00:29:45,728 --> 00:29:47,095
You can leave her.

604
00:29:47,129 --> 00:29:48,363
Thank you. I can handle this.

605
00:29:48,397 --> 00:29:49,465
Thank you.

606
00:29:51,133 --> 00:29:52,434
Please.

607
00:29:52,468 --> 00:29:55,170
- You want a part in my movie?
- Yeah!

608
00:29:55,204 --> 00:29:57,172
Well, let's have a read
for her, shall we?

609
00:29:57,206 --> 00:29:59,041
I mean, she's probably
just as talented

610
00:29:59,074 --> 00:30:02,411
as one of your soap opera
bimbos, right?

611
00:30:02,444 --> 00:30:05,147
Zac, is this gonna take long?

612
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:06,982
Oh, it's okay. I know the lines.

613
00:30:09,117 --> 00:30:10,285
Okay. Ready.

614
00:30:15,190 --> 00:30:18,393
You... killed... my brother!

615
00:30:18,427 --> 00:30:23,700
Now... it's... time...
for you to meet... your... fate!

616
00:30:28,437 --> 00:30:30,205
[clears throat]

617
00:30:30,239 --> 00:30:32,742
You don't understand.
I was framed.

618
00:30:32,775 --> 00:30:34,376
I did not kill your brother.

619
00:30:34,409 --> 00:30:35,644
Liar!

620
00:30:35,678 --> 00:30:38,046
Vengeance... is... mine!

621
00:30:40,616 --> 00:30:43,285
Okay, okay. That's enough.

622
00:30:43,318 --> 00:30:44,721
We'll let you know.

623
00:30:47,322 --> 00:30:48,557
I was really bad, wasn't I?

624
00:30:52,327 --> 00:30:54,496
Shit! Shit!

625
00:30:55,765 --> 00:30:57,232
Look, honey.

626
00:30:57,834 --> 00:31:00,202
There's a point in people's
life where they realize

627
00:31:00,235 --> 00:31:03,205
that the profession
that they've dreamed of having

628
00:31:03,238 --> 00:31:06,308
isn't gonna work out, so they
choose another occupation.

629
00:31:06,341 --> 00:31:10,178
Maybe, I don't know, maybe
you should go with waitressing.

630
00:31:10,212 --> 00:31:12,447
Okay? Okay.

631
00:31:12,481 --> 00:31:14,116
Good girl.

632
00:31:14,149 --> 00:31:16,853
Now Mr. Kawalsky and I
have a ton of work to do,

633
00:31:16,886 --> 00:31:19,555
so if you don't mind...

634
00:31:19,588 --> 00:31:23,225
You have to help me, please.
Acting is my life.

635
00:31:23,258 --> 00:31:26,528
I took that job as a PA
'cause I had to be on set.

636
00:31:26,562 --> 00:31:28,096
And then you fired me as a PA.

637
00:31:28,130 --> 00:31:29,498
And that's fine,
because I'm not a PA.

638
00:31:29,531 --> 00:31:32,134
You want me to be honest?
You're too old,

639
00:31:32,167 --> 00:31:34,837
you're not pretty,
and your tits are too small.

640
00:31:34,871 --> 00:31:36,739
And if we shot you
from the back of the head

641
00:31:36,773 --> 00:31:38,741
you'd still be too ugly.

642
00:31:38,775 --> 00:31:41,643
Please. I'm just asking
for a chance here.

643
00:31:41,678 --> 00:31:44,379
- You can't act!
- Then teach me.

644
00:31:44,981 --> 00:31:47,850
You said you could take
an unknown and make her a star.

645
00:31:47,884 --> 00:31:49,384
- I heard you.
- Lois!

646
00:31:49,418 --> 00:31:51,353
Don't let him call security,
please.

647
00:31:51,386 --> 00:31:53,823
I don't need to be taken out
twice in a day. Please.

648
00:31:53,856 --> 00:31:55,457
Please.

649
00:31:55,490 --> 00:31:57,760
Fine. You don't need to take me.
I'll go.

650
00:32:00,195 --> 00:32:01,296
[laughing]

651
00:32:02,497 --> 00:32:04,600
Oh, that's funny.

652
00:32:04,633 --> 00:32:07,269
Think you can teach that to act?

653
00:32:07,302 --> 00:32:09,605
[laughs] Did you see
the way she moved?

654
00:32:09,638 --> 00:32:12,374
[laughing]

655
00:32:12,407 --> 00:32:14,376
Shit, if you could teach
that to act,

656
00:32:14,409 --> 00:32:17,814
I'd convince Ethan Burns
to do the lead in the film.

657
00:32:17,847 --> 00:32:19,481
[laughing]

658
00:32:20,415 --> 00:32:22,250
Really?

659
00:32:22,284 --> 00:32:24,486
If I get a performance
out of her,

660
00:32:24,519 --> 00:32:25,822
you'll get Ethan Burns for me?

661
00:32:26,188 --> 00:32:28,557
- Huh?
- It's a deal.

662
00:32:28,590 --> 00:32:32,294
No. You can't teach
that how to act.

663
00:32:32,327 --> 00:32:34,196
I mean, we don't have the time.

664
00:32:34,229 --> 00:32:36,933
Plus you've been struggling
with the soap opera stars

665
00:32:36,966 --> 00:32:40,202
and she makes them
look like Oscar winners.

666
00:32:40,235 --> 00:32:41,503
Is it a deal, Grant?

667
00:32:41,536 --> 00:32:43,806
No. She... She's...
She can't do it.

668
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:46,876
- She's too...
- Let me prove it to you. Okay?

669
00:32:46,909 --> 00:32:49,378
If I get her to act,
you get me Burns,

670
00:32:49,411 --> 00:32:50,913
that'll be enough evidence
to show you

671
00:32:50,947 --> 00:32:52,547
that I still
have not lost my touch.

672
00:32:52,581 --> 00:32:55,250
He won't wanna do it
on such short notice.

673
00:32:55,718 --> 00:32:58,387
I thought you said
you could get Ethan in a minute.

674
00:33:01,691 --> 00:33:03,826
How long is this getting
a performance out of her

675
00:33:03,860 --> 00:33:05,327
going to take?

676
00:33:06,428 --> 00:33:07,462
Give me a week.

677
00:33:08,397 --> 00:33:11,366
Okay. Fine. Deal.

678
00:33:12,902 --> 00:33:15,671
If you get a performance
outta her in a week,

679
00:33:15,705 --> 00:33:17,305
I'll get you Ethan.

680
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:19,541
You're on.

681
00:33:20,710 --> 00:33:22,544
Hey! Wait!

682
00:33:22,577 --> 00:33:24,914
It's okay, Lois.
I'll handle this.

683
00:33:24,947 --> 00:33:27,649
All right. You can do it,

684
00:33:27,684 --> 00:33:31,453
provided I coach you.
You have one week.

685
00:33:31,486 --> 00:33:33,923
You can't give me a performance
by then, you're out.

686
00:33:35,424 --> 00:33:36,491
Deal.

687
00:33:39,628 --> 00:33:42,932
No, Grant. I can do this.

688
00:33:42,965 --> 00:33:45,233
You just concentrate
on getting Ethan.

689
00:33:45,267 --> 00:33:47,235
- [knocking]
- Hold on a second.

690
00:33:47,269 --> 00:33:48,971
- Yeah?
- [man] Yo, Zac.

691
00:33:49,005 --> 00:33:51,573
- Jodea's here for a lesson.
- Already?

692
00:33:52,641 --> 00:33:55,510
Shit! Hey, I gotta go.

693
00:33:55,544 --> 00:33:57,212
All right. Bring her in.

694
00:33:59,882 --> 00:34:00,917
Hey.

695
00:34:02,384 --> 00:34:04,319
Wow!

696
00:34:04,352 --> 00:34:07,456
Wow! I didn't think
your trailer would be so...

697
00:34:09,826 --> 00:34:12,895
Yeah, well. They keep trying
to give me a bigger trailer,

698
00:34:12,929 --> 00:34:15,998
but I don't really buy into
that Hollywood bullshit, so...

699
00:34:16,032 --> 00:34:18,467
Don't wanna let go of my baby.

700
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:22,705
So, Jodea. Jodea, Jodea, Jodea.

701
00:34:22,739 --> 00:34:24,841
What kinda name is that?

702
00:34:24,874 --> 00:34:26,675
It's a mixture
of my grandmothers' names.

703
00:34:26,709 --> 00:34:30,545
My dad's mom was Jody,
my mom's was Claudea.

704
00:34:30,579 --> 00:34:32,915
So, put them together,
you get Jodea.

705
00:34:32,949 --> 00:34:34,817
So, Jodea,

706
00:34:34,851 --> 00:34:37,452
how come someone
as intelligent as you

707
00:34:37,486 --> 00:34:39,889
is doing something as stupid
as trying to be an actor?

708
00:34:40,455 --> 00:34:43,625
Being an actor is all
I ever wanted to do, I guess.

709
00:34:43,658 --> 00:34:45,327
I mean,
when I was a little girl,

710
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:47,797
my grandmother used
to take me to the theater

711
00:34:47,830 --> 00:34:51,366
and I used to just watch
the actors up there

712
00:34:51,399 --> 00:34:53,002
and wanna be up there.

713
00:34:53,035 --> 00:34:54,737
Then when I got older, she and I

714
00:34:54,771 --> 00:34:57,339
used to watch
old movies together.

715
00:34:57,372 --> 00:34:59,942
She was the only one
who really encouraged me

716
00:34:59,976 --> 00:35:02,410
to follow my dream.

717
00:35:02,812 --> 00:35:04,346
So, what's your favorite movie?

718
00:35:04,379 --> 00:35:05,948
<i>The Last Time I Saw Paris.</i>

719
00:35:11,553 --> 00:35:13,355
You're a girl
after my own heart.

720
00:35:14,157 --> 00:35:16,424
Make no mistake,
I'm after it all right.

721
00:35:21,396 --> 00:35:23,800
So you probably know a little
bit about the movie already.

722
00:35:23,833 --> 00:35:25,534
Your character's name's Nicole.

723
00:35:25,567 --> 00:35:27,402
She is a Secret Service agent

724
00:35:27,435 --> 00:35:30,405
and she's after revenge
from Jake, the protagonist.

725
00:35:30,438 --> 00:35:32,407
I'd love to act
as a Secret Service agent.

726
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:33,976
- What did you just say?
- You know, to act.

727
00:35:34,010 --> 00:35:35,443
Did you just say act?

728
00:35:35,477 --> 00:35:38,446
No! You don't act!
You never act.

729
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:39,548
[phone buzzes]

730
00:35:41,851 --> 00:35:44,619
Grant, if you call me
about this one more time

731
00:35:44,653 --> 00:35:47,422
you're fired, okay?
The bet's still on.

732
00:35:51,459 --> 00:35:52,494
[sighs]

733
00:35:53,528 --> 00:35:54,663
Let's get to work.

734
00:35:54,931 --> 00:35:57,499
[soft piano music]

735
00:35:59,568 --> 00:36:02,805
Vengeance... is... mine!

736
00:36:03,638 --> 00:36:04,974
I suck.

737
00:36:06,608 --> 00:36:07,642
Yeah, you do.

738
00:36:11,580 --> 00:36:15,852
Try to remember, you just ran
20 miles to get him.

739
00:36:15,885 --> 00:36:17,987
Okay? You're exhausted.

740
00:36:18,020 --> 00:36:20,388
Maybe I need
to get you up and running,

741
00:36:20,422 --> 00:36:23,558
working up a sweat,
method acting style.

742
00:36:26,595 --> 00:36:28,998
I need to see the anger in you.

743
00:36:29,031 --> 00:36:30,800
Why this scene is so complicated

744
00:36:30,833 --> 00:36:33,602
is because although you hate him
with a passion

745
00:36:33,635 --> 00:36:34,837
you secretly love him.

746
00:36:34,871 --> 00:36:36,571
Yeah, well nothing
spells true love

747
00:36:36,605 --> 00:36:38,506
like wanting to kill someone,
right?

748
00:36:39,441 --> 00:36:42,812
Yeah, well you'd be surprised
what people are capable of.

749
00:36:44,914 --> 00:36:47,016
Have you ever been hurt
by someone you love?

750
00:36:47,049 --> 00:36:48,583
All the time.

751
00:36:48,617 --> 00:36:49,986
Tell me
about one of those times.

752
00:36:50,019 --> 00:36:51,120
What?

753
00:36:51,153 --> 00:36:52,788
I need to understand my actors.

754
00:36:52,822 --> 00:36:54,891
Know where they're coming from.

755
00:36:54,924 --> 00:36:58,660
Well, I was seeing this guy,
and he was an actor.

756
00:36:58,694 --> 00:37:00,662
That's bound to be
a fucking disaster.

757
00:37:00,696 --> 00:37:06,135
And we were together six months,
and then he cheated on me

758
00:37:06,168 --> 00:37:08,603
with a girl he thought
could help his career.

759
00:37:09,872 --> 00:37:11,073
Lowlife scum.

760
00:37:12,875 --> 00:37:14,977
How did you feel when you
discovered he cheated on you?

761
00:37:15,011 --> 00:37:16,979
- Angry.
- Good.

762
00:37:17,747 --> 00:37:19,882
- Hurt.
- Better.

763
00:37:20,615 --> 00:37:22,484
Hurt and angry.

764
00:37:22,517 --> 00:37:24,586
That's what we want here.

765
00:37:25,154 --> 00:37:26,554
Let's do it again.

766
00:37:31,961 --> 00:37:33,129
Action!

767
00:37:33,162 --> 00:37:35,898
You killed my brother.

768
00:37:35,932 --> 00:37:39,668
Now it's time for you to meet
your fate.

769
00:37:39,702 --> 00:37:41,569
You don't understand.
I was framed.

770
00:37:41,603 --> 00:37:43,139
I never killed your brother.

771
00:37:43,172 --> 00:37:47,043
Liar! Vengeance is mine!

772
00:37:54,216 --> 00:37:55,617
What the hell are you doing?

773
00:37:56,618 --> 00:37:58,154
Punching.

774
00:37:58,187 --> 00:38:01,090
- It said on the script...
- Yeah, just... just don't.

775
00:38:01,991 --> 00:38:03,960
- Okay.
- Don't.

776
00:38:03,993 --> 00:38:05,695
You killed my brother.

777
00:38:05,728 --> 00:38:08,130
Now it's time for you
to meet your fate.

778
00:38:08,164 --> 00:38:09,664
You killed my brother.

779
00:38:09,699 --> 00:38:11,033
Now it's time...

780
00:38:11,067 --> 00:38:12,268
[sighs]

781
00:38:12,301 --> 00:38:13,803
- [knocking]
- You killed my...

782
00:38:13,836 --> 00:38:15,805
- Hello.
- Hey.

783
00:38:24,213 --> 00:38:26,548
This is the original
movie poster

784
00:38:26,581 --> 00:38:28,250
of <i>A Farewell to Arms.</i>

785
00:38:28,284 --> 00:38:31,619
That's nice, Harold.

786
00:38:31,653 --> 00:38:34,223
Ernest Hemingway hated
this version of his movie.

787
00:38:34,256 --> 00:38:36,658
I rather liked it.

788
00:38:36,692 --> 00:38:38,660
Much better
than the 1957 version.

789
00:38:38,694 --> 00:38:40,262
David O. Selznick
cast his wife in that.

790
00:38:40,296 --> 00:38:42,564
- She was...
- Harold, I've got work to do.

791
00:38:43,099 --> 00:38:45,101
- Have you got an acting job?
- Yes.

792
00:38:45,134 --> 00:38:47,669
In Zac Kawalsky's film.

793
00:38:47,703 --> 00:38:49,905
Has he paid you for the damage
on your car yet?

794
00:38:50,806 --> 00:38:52,742
We've come to an arrangement.

795
00:38:52,775 --> 00:38:56,544
Jodes, I hope the arrangement
is him fixing your car.

796
00:38:56,578 --> 00:38:58,280
I can't have you running
and taking public transport,

797
00:38:58,314 --> 00:38:59,982
especially at night
in this town.

798
00:39:00,016 --> 00:39:01,951
He's given me role
in his movie instead. Okay?

799
00:39:02,351 --> 00:39:04,053
That weasel!

800
00:39:04,086 --> 00:39:07,223
If he thinks he's just
going to... just... [grunts]

801
00:39:07,256 --> 00:39:09,158
I'm gonna show up at his... I'm
gonna show up at his front door.

802
00:39:09,191 --> 00:39:10,760
- You're not gonna...
- I'll give him a piece

803
00:39:10,793 --> 00:39:12,328
of my mind and then
we'll see who's paying...

804
00:39:12,361 --> 00:39:14,130
Harold, you're not gonna
show up on his doorstep, okay?

805
00:39:14,163 --> 00:39:16,132
Look, I'm a big girl.
I made this decision. Please.

806
00:39:16,165 --> 00:39:18,134
It's a great opportunity for me.
Okay?

807
00:39:18,167 --> 00:39:20,668
- Just be happy for me.
- I'm happy for you.

808
00:39:20,703 --> 00:39:23,973
- Can I please just rehearse?
- All right. All right. Well.

809
00:39:24,006 --> 00:39:25,741
I mean,
the damage was pretty awful.

810
00:39:25,775 --> 00:39:27,777
Well, it's my decision.

811
00:39:27,810 --> 00:39:29,111
I'm not talking about your car.

812
00:39:29,145 --> 00:39:30,780
I'm talking
about his last picture.

813
00:39:32,348 --> 00:39:34,283
Just agree to disagree.

814
00:39:34,316 --> 00:39:36,218
- All right. Carry on.
- Okay.

815
00:39:36,252 --> 00:39:37,953
Punching your pillow.

816
00:39:37,987 --> 00:39:38,954
Poor pillow.

817
00:39:39,855 --> 00:39:41,924
Have you got
any frame ideas for this?

818
00:39:41,957 --> 00:39:43,893
- Harold!
- Sorry. Not here. Never here.

819
00:39:47,997 --> 00:39:51,599
Vengeance... is mine!

820
00:39:51,633 --> 00:39:53,202
[groans] You sucked.

821
00:39:55,071 --> 00:39:57,206
[soft piano music]

822
00:40:01,710 --> 00:40:05,314
- [groaning]
- [thumping]

823
00:40:07,750 --> 00:40:08,884
- Henry.
- [grunts]

824
00:40:09,852 --> 00:40:11,187
Hey, Zac!

825
00:40:11,220 --> 00:40:12,855
- Hey, man. How are you?
- Doing great.

826
00:40:12,888 --> 00:40:14,690
It's been a while
since I seen ya.

827
00:40:14,723 --> 00:40:16,892
Well, I've been busy.

828
00:40:16,926 --> 00:40:19,295
Unfortunately. This is
my old stomping grounds.

829
00:40:19,795 --> 00:40:21,397
- That's Henry.
- Hey, how are ya?

830
00:40:21,430 --> 00:40:23,866
- Hey.
- He's been my personal trainer

831
00:40:23,899 --> 00:40:25,633
since I was a kid.

832
00:40:26,102 --> 00:40:27,770
Helped me stay focused.

833
00:40:27,803 --> 00:40:29,637
[chuckles] He's focused.

834
00:40:29,671 --> 00:40:32,408
Well, guys, I'm outta here, man.
I'll let you have at it.

835
00:40:32,441 --> 00:40:33,742
- Thanks.
- Nice meeting you.

836
00:40:35,111 --> 00:40:37,847
Well, shall we begin?

837
00:40:46,956 --> 00:40:49,125
Acting 101,
you've got to identify

838
00:40:49,158 --> 00:40:50,693
with your character.

839
00:40:50,726 --> 00:40:53,362
This has to come naturally.
All right.

840
00:40:53,929 --> 00:40:57,166
So stand with your feet
shoulders-width apart.

841
00:40:58,067 --> 00:40:59,001
Arms up.

842
00:41:00,236 --> 00:41:01,636
Right foot back.

843
00:41:02,471 --> 00:41:04,106
Bend the knees.

844
00:41:04,573 --> 00:41:06,175
No. Don't bend your shoulders.

845
00:41:07,343 --> 00:41:09,345
Now, right arm back.

846
00:41:10,946 --> 00:41:12,414
Now, the key is

847
00:41:12,448 --> 00:41:14,216
your strength
comes from your hips.

848
00:41:20,856 --> 00:41:21,891
Now you try.

849
00:41:24,193 --> 00:41:25,094
[thud]

850
00:41:25,561 --> 00:41:28,030
[giggles]
I didn't mean that. Sorry.

851
00:41:28,898 --> 00:41:32,268
Guess I'm gonna have to take out
extra insurance.

852
00:41:32,301 --> 00:41:33,936
Try to hit the bag.

853
00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:38,774
Again.

854
00:41:40,776 --> 00:41:41,911
Do it again.

855
00:41:43,746 --> 00:41:45,014
Shouldn't we have gloves
for this?

856
00:41:45,047 --> 00:41:46,448
Gloves are for pussies.

857
00:41:46,482 --> 00:41:48,817
Think of that lowlife scum
who dumped you.

858
00:41:49,852 --> 00:41:51,687
Okay? This is his face.

859
00:41:52,388 --> 00:41:55,090
No, no, no, no, no.

1036
00:51:09,045 --> 00:51:12,647
Hey, come on.
Let's get back to work.

1037
00:51:12,682 --> 00:51:14,282
- Okay.
- A seat for you.

1038
00:51:19,354 --> 00:51:20,790
- Boy.
- Girl.

1039
00:51:20,823 --> 00:51:22,859
- Cat.
- Dog. Wait!

1040
00:51:23,860 --> 00:51:25,995
- Why did you say cat?
- Huh?

1041
00:51:26,028 --> 00:51:27,864
I said girl. You said cat.

1042
00:51:27,897 --> 00:51:30,332
Not all cats are girls.

1043
00:51:30,365 --> 00:51:32,735
Well, not all directors
are freaks.

1044
00:51:32,769 --> 00:51:34,971
Besides, I like cats.
They're loyal.

1045
00:51:35,004 --> 00:51:36,873
I like dogs.

1046
00:51:36,906 --> 00:51:39,407
Because they're always
happy to see you.

1047
00:51:39,441 --> 00:51:40,943
Cats are happy to see you.

1048
00:51:42,444 --> 00:51:44,479
[soft music]

1049
00:51:44,914 --> 00:51:46,548
Just afraid to show it.

1050
00:51:49,752 --> 00:51:51,419
All right.
Let's try our scene again.

1051
00:51:59,394 --> 00:52:03,398
I wanted to hate you,
but I couldn't.

1052
00:52:03,431 --> 00:52:05,333
[romantic music plays]

1053
00:52:06,468 --> 00:52:07,804
I love you.

1054
00:52:08,570 --> 00:52:10,438
Are you sure
that's how you feel?

1055
00:52:12,474 --> 00:52:16,411
Oh, sh... That was terrible!

1056
00:52:16,444 --> 00:52:18,513
I'm sorry. That was really bad.

1057
00:52:21,851 --> 00:52:23,385
Actually, you were incredible.

1058
00:52:25,554 --> 00:52:27,622
You see, Jodea,

1059
00:52:27,656 --> 00:52:31,393
the secret is
acting isn't acting.

1060
00:52:32,128 --> 00:52:34,329
Acting is being.

1061
00:52:35,865 --> 00:52:37,733
Excuse me.
Sorry to interrupt you.

1062
00:52:37,767 --> 00:52:40,402
There's some guy out here
with a British accent,

1063
00:52:40,435 --> 00:52:41,771
says his name is Harold,

1064
00:52:41,804 --> 00:52:44,506
talking about the movie
<i>Malcolm X.</i>

1065
00:52:44,539 --> 00:52:46,474
- Harold!
- Hello.

1066
00:52:46,508 --> 00:52:47,409
How did you get in?

1067
00:52:48,010 --> 00:52:49,611
[mumbling]

1068
00:52:49,644 --> 00:52:53,883
- Ah! You must be Zac Kawalsky.
- I must be.

1069
00:52:53,916 --> 00:52:56,384
I just wanted to inform you
that this arrangement

1070
00:52:56,418 --> 00:52:58,054
is grossly unfair.

1071
00:52:58,653 --> 00:53:00,957
You see, I've calculated exactly
what you owe Jodea,

1072
00:53:00,990 --> 00:53:04,459
and it comes to about $5,000.
See? Notes here.

1073
00:53:04,492 --> 00:53:06,729
Whereas one week
of acting lessons

1074
00:53:06,762 --> 00:53:09,131
simply adds up
to no more than 500.

1075
00:53:09,165 --> 00:53:11,033
There's quite
a discrepancy there. See?

1076
00:53:11,067 --> 00:53:12,735
As you know,
Jodea isn't insured.

1077
00:53:12,768 --> 00:53:14,103
- She can't afford the repairs.
- Harold, no.

1078
00:53:14,136 --> 00:53:15,670
Is that so?

1079
00:53:15,705 --> 00:53:17,106
That's okay. Calm down.

1080
00:53:18,908 --> 00:53:21,676
Why don't we start over?
Hi. My name's Zac Kawalsky.

1081
00:53:22,377 --> 00:53:25,413
- Harold Jameson.
- Good. Nice to meet you.

1082
00:53:25,447 --> 00:53:27,549
Now, what the fuck do you want?
Are you some kind of actor?

1083
00:53:27,582 --> 00:53:29,451
An act... No!

1084
00:53:29,484 --> 00:53:31,586
- But I am writing a film...
- Oh, shit!

1085
00:53:31,620 --> 00:53:34,790
All about how Moses
was assassinated.

1086
00:53:34,824 --> 00:53:36,993
You see,
according to Sigmund Freud

1087
00:53:37,026 --> 00:53:39,527
Moses was actually Egyptian.

1088
00:53:39,561 --> 00:53:42,564
Have you got any tea?
Earl Grey, dash of milk.

1089
00:53:42,597 --> 00:53:44,901
I'm sorry, um, Harold, right?

1090
00:53:44,934 --> 00:53:47,169
Listen,
I've had a very long day,

1091
00:53:47,203 --> 00:53:50,106
so is there, um,
is this all you got for me?

1092
00:53:50,139 --> 00:53:52,708
No. No, actually,
it's not all I've got for you.

1093
00:53:52,742 --> 00:53:54,643
See, that movie,
directly behind you

1094
00:53:54,676 --> 00:53:57,079
is <i>The End of Times,</i>
but also the most

1095
00:53:57,113 --> 00:54:00,883
historically inaccurate film
I've ever seen in my life.

1096
00:54:00,917 --> 00:54:02,785
During World War One,

1097
00:54:02,818 --> 00:54:04,720
women would never
have been allowed into...

1098
00:54:04,754 --> 00:54:08,224
Women didn't receive the vote
minimum until 1918, of course.

1099
00:54:08,257 --> 00:54:15,231
And... [continues indistinctly]

1100
00:54:15,264 --> 00:54:18,167
My movie about Moses is going
to be historically accurate.

1101
00:54:18,200 --> 00:54:20,202
I know Hollywood fancies...

1102
00:54:20,236 --> 00:54:21,603
Yeah, right. You know what?

1103
00:54:21,636 --> 00:54:23,205
[overlapping dialogue]

1104
00:54:23,239 --> 00:54:25,007
It's time you Brexit exit
your ass back to England.

1105
00:54:25,041 --> 00:54:26,242
How about that?

1106
00:54:26,275 --> 00:54:28,177
- Thanks, Fred.
- [Fred mumbles]

1107
00:54:30,612 --> 00:54:32,514
Sorry about that. [sighs]

1108
00:54:32,547 --> 00:54:35,785
It's okay. Fred's
in the first AD since day one.

1109
00:54:35,818 --> 00:54:39,855
He's trained to handle
all types of people.

1110
00:54:43,826 --> 00:54:46,729
- Greg.
- So how's the bet going?

1111
00:54:46,762 --> 00:54:48,230
You wanna give up yet?

1112
00:54:48,264 --> 00:54:51,901
She's going. She's going good.

1113
00:54:51,934 --> 00:54:53,269

it is Friday,

1115
00:54:54,971 --> 00:54:56,872
and we gotta start shooting
again on Monday.

<i>Deadline's tomorrow.</i>

Can you shut the fuck up, Grant?

1118
00:55:00,743 --> 00:55:02,712
I got this, okay?

1119
00:55:02,745 --> 00:55:05,214
Really, 'cause I haven't heard
from you in like a week.

1123
00:55:15,324 --> 00:55:19,695
[Zac] All right.
You can do this, okay?

You're trying too hard now.

1127
00:55:31,207 --> 00:55:33,042
You need to be more natural.

1128
00:55:34,844 --> 00:55:35,745
Close your eyes.

1129
00:55:42,251 --> 00:55:44,120
I want you to think
about your ex.

1130
00:55:46,856 --> 00:55:49,591
I want you to imagine him
and her in bed together.

1131
00:55:51,827 --> 00:55:54,830
Imagine the way he looks at her,

1132
00:55:54,864 --> 00:55:56,564
like he never looked at you.

1133
00:55:59,667 --> 00:56:00,736
Take a moment.

[solemn music plays]

What?

1137
00:56:34,370 --> 00:56:36,005
I need to see your face.

Okay. [clears throat]

1139
00:56:47,149 --> 00:56:48,918
You killed my brother.

Now it's time for you
to meet your fate.

00:56:57,760 --> 00:56:59,161
[Zac] Say the line.

You wanna know why
I took you on?

1151
00:57:40,002 --> 00:57:43,405
Because the day that you came
and asked me for the role,

1152
00:57:43,439 --> 00:57:45,741
I saw the passion in your eyes.

1153
00:57:48,310 --> 00:57:50,279
The emotion is there, Jodea.

1154
00:57:52,081 --> 00:57:54,283
You just need to figure out
how to channel it.

1155
00:57:59,922 --> 00:58:01,690
One more time.

1156
00:58:12,801 --> 00:58:15,171
- You killed my brother.
- No!

00:58:17,006 --> 00:58:20,176
- You killed my brother.
- No!

1158

- You killed my brother.
- No!

You killed my brother!

1160
00:58:26,982 --> 00:58:30,786
- You killed my br...
- You're not convincing me.

1161
00:58:30,819 --> 00:58:32,922
You killed... Oh, jeez!
That was terrible.

1162
00:58:32,955 --> 00:58:35,157
- You're right it's terrible.
- Would you just stop

1163
00:58:35,191 --> 00:58:36,926
putting me down.
I know I'm shit.

1164
00:58:36,959 --> 00:58:39,361
I don't need you telling
me about it all the time.

1165
00:58:39,395 --> 00:58:41,430
- You killed my brother.
- No!

1166

You killed my brother.

1167

- Now, it...
- All right! Know what?

1168
00:58:46,035 --> 00:58:47,870
Let's just forget about this,
okay?

1169
00:58:47,903 --> 00:58:49,738
- It's a stupid idea!
- No! Wait!

1170
00:58:49,772 --> 00:58:51,840
- Wait. What are you doing?
- You're fucking terrible.

1171
00:58:51,874 --> 00:58:53,909
- Screw you!
- Then convince me.

1172
00:58:53,943 --> 00:58:55,778
You killed my brother.
Now it's time

1173
00:58:55,811 --> 00:58:57,980
- for you to meet your fate.
- You don't understand.

1174
00:58:58,013 --> 00:58:59,481
I was framed.
I never killed your brother.

- You did it!
- I did it?

- You mean... You mean I was good?
- Hell, yeah!

Yes!

00:59:21,237 --> 00:59:23,973
- Really?
- Do I ever bullshit you?

1183

[Grant] Not bad.

Hey, Ethan? It's me.

1191
00:59:54,903 --> 00:59:57,306
How come there are never
any elite female characters

1192
00:59:57,339 --> 00:59:58,374
in your movies?

1193
01:00:00,075 --> 01:00:02,344
Well, <i>End of Time</i> had that one

1194
01:00:02,378 --> 01:00:05,347
tiny little role for a woman
where you seemed to be making

1195
01:00:05,381 --> 01:00:07,983
a really historically inaccurate
feminist statement

1196
01:00:08,017 --> 01:00:11,387
by making her an army general
in World War One.

1197
01:00:11,420 --> 01:00:13,422
This didn't have any women.

1198

Oh, except that idiot,
who just took her clothes off.

1199
01:00:16,292 --> 01:00:20,929
<i>Deadly Games</i> has Nicole
who's in two scenes.

I write things I can relate to.

1201
01:00:22,898 --> 01:00:24,433
So you can't relate to women?

1202
01:00:26,568 --> 01:00:28,003
I got something for you.

[soft music playing]

1204
01:00:36,879 --> 01:00:38,414
It's for your car.

1205
01:00:38,447 --> 01:00:40,382
Oh, and look!
I got your name right.

1206
01:00:40,416 --> 01:00:43,218

01:08:59,916 --> 01:09:01,851
Yeah, good job. Yeah, thank you.

1379
01:09:01,884 --> 01:09:03,886
Thank you people.
Thank you for your time.

1380
01:09:03,920 --> 01:09:05,822
Ethan. Come on.

1381
01:09:13,729 --> 01:09:16,833
I think you should play Ethan's
leading lady in <i>Nightfire Three.</i>

1382
01:09:16,866 --> 01:09:18,868
- What do you say?
- Yeah!

1383
01:09:18,901 --> 01:09:20,502
Yeah? You got it.

1384
01:09:20,535 --> 01:09:22,004
I wanna get you
fighting Ethan again.

1385
01:09:22,038 --> 01:09:24,372
How many scenes is she in?

1386
01:09:24,406 --> 01:09:26,843
Only two, but they're
great fighting scenes.

1387
01:09:26,876 --> 01:09:28,643
Another action film?

1388
01:09:30,512 --> 01:09:32,581
Well, yeah.

1389
01:09:32,614 --> 01:09:35,151
- It's what I'm know for, right?
- It doesn't have to be.

1390
01:09:35,184 --> 01:09:38,087
This dramatic piece
you've written is excellent.

1391
01:09:39,554 --> 01:09:41,556
It's just something
I'm working on the side.

1392
01:09:41,590 --> 01:09:43,525
It's not something
I'm passionate about.

1393
01:09:43,558 --> 01:09:45,594
- A dream piece.
- Well you should do more drama.

1394
01:09:45,627 --> 01:09:48,630
- You write it really well.
- According to your friend,

1395
01:09:48,663 --> 01:09:51,934
- I'm inaccurate in my research.
- Well yeah, you are,

1396
01:09:51,968 --> 01:09:53,635
but you can always improve.

1397
01:09:56,438 --> 01:09:58,174
Really think it's good?

1398
01:09:58,207 --> 01:10:00,977
Well, the girl's
a bit of an idiot.

1399
01:10:01,010 --> 01:10:02,477
She's not an idiot.

1400
01:10:02,510 --> 01:10:04,512
Yeah, she is.
She works in a café.

1401
01:10:04,546 --> 01:10:06,115
All these people
are waiting for their food

1402
01:10:06,148 --> 01:10:07,950
and she stands there
balling her eyes out

1403
01:10:07,984 --> 01:10:09,919
because some deadshit dumped
her. She's an idiot.

1404
01:10:09,952 --> 01:10:12,121
Well, yeah,
because I'm sure that when...

1405
01:10:12,154 --> 01:10:13,890
Have you ever worked in a café?

1406
01:10:15,791 --> 01:10:17,994
Um, no, but...

1407
01:10:18,027 --> 01:10:19,729
Well, Mr. Kawalsky,

1408
01:10:19,762 --> 01:10:22,064
I believe you need to research
your films better.

1409
01:10:29,739 --> 01:10:32,174
No, no, no, no, no.
Don't look in there.

1410
01:10:32,208 --> 01:10:35,011
Flavor's over there,
not over here. Don't come here.

1411
01:10:43,853 --> 01:10:45,988
Hurry up with the flavors,
we've customers waiting.

1412
01:10:46,022 --> 01:10:47,757
I got it. I got it.

1414
01:10:59,902 --> 01:11:01,536
Oh, God!

1416
01:11:05,741 --> 01:11:07,877
Identify with your characters.

1417
01:11:07,910 --> 01:11:10,478
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
How's this film going, Shlomo?

1418
01:11:10,512 --> 01:11:13,716
- Who's...? [unclear]
- Oh, it's going good, um.

1419
01:11:13,749 --> 01:11:16,719
Today we gave my script
to Isabella Andrews' agent.

1420
01:11:16,752 --> 01:11:18,653
Watch. She'll drop out.

1421
01:11:18,688 --> 01:11:20,823
She's a fuckin' pain in the ass
to work with.

1422
01:11:20,856 --> 01:11:22,992
Quiet, dude.
We've got customers.

1423
01:11:23,025 --> 01:11:24,226
[Zac sneezes]

1424
01:11:26,628 --> 01:11:28,030
- [sneezes]
- Okay.

1425
01:11:28,064 --> 01:11:29,966
You take care of the customers.

1426
01:11:29,999 --> 01:11:31,867
- I'll do the flavors.
- Yeah.

1427
01:11:34,937 --> 01:11:36,038
Next!

1428
01:11:36,072 --> 01:11:37,940
Why you bring me such a moron?

1429
01:11:37,974 --> 01:11:40,242
We were short-staffed, remember?

1430
01:11:40,276 --> 01:11:41,944
- Hi.
- Yeah, hi.

1431
01:11:41,978 --> 01:11:44,680
- Hi.
- How many calories

1432
01:11:44,714 --> 01:11:46,916
- are in your skinny latte?
- Five hundred.

1433
01:11:48,884 --> 01:11:52,554
Um, okay? How many
are in your non-fat milkshake?

1434
01:11:56,624 --> 01:11:58,995
I... A thousand?

1435
01:11:59,028 --> 01:12:00,896
Look, ladies.
I don't know, okay?

1436
01:12:00,930 --> 01:12:03,498
[stammers] Okay?
Everything's fattening here.

1437
01:12:04,599 --> 01:12:06,002
Okay.

1438
01:12:06,035 --> 01:12:08,536
- Two waters?
- Yeah, we'll have two waters.

1439
01:12:11,007 --> 01:12:12,208
Can you do that?

1440
01:12:13,142 --> 01:12:14,609
Yes.

1441
01:12:14,642 --> 01:12:16,678
Where did you find
this [unclear]?

1442
01:12:16,712 --> 01:12:18,147
I found him around.

1443
01:12:18,180 --> 01:12:19,882
He needs the experience, Shlomo.

1444
01:12:19,915 --> 01:12:21,717
They should pay me
for the experience.

1445
01:12:23,185 --> 01:12:25,021
- All right, um...
- Thanks.

1446
01:12:25,054 --> 01:12:27,790
- Do you take debit?
- Yeah. I think so.

1447
01:12:27,823 --> 01:12:28,958
Um, hold on.

1448
01:12:30,960 --> 01:12:32,194
Um, we have an audition

1449
01:12:32,228 --> 01:12:34,930
and you're making us
super later.

1450
01:12:34,964 --> 01:12:37,833
It'd be a lot quicker if you
just had cash. Do you have cash?

1451
01:12:42,705 --> 01:12:45,174
What are you doing?

1452
01:12:45,207 --> 01:12:47,843
We do not needs straws, dude.
Save the turtles.

1453
01:12:47,877 --> 01:12:51,747
- Yeah, save the turtles, dude.
- Yeah, save the turtles.

1454
01:12:51,781 --> 01:12:52,948
Save Vegas.

1455
01:12:54,283 --> 01:12:57,319
Let's see. I'll have a...

1456
01:12:57,353 --> 01:12:59,321
Oh, hello!

01:12:59,355 --> 01:13:01,924
Looks like the... [chuckles]

...directing career
didn't quite work.

1459
01:13:03,826 --> 01:13:05,761
Can I help you?

1460
01:13:05,795 --> 01:13:08,297
I suppose you could get me
some accuracy in your movies.

1461
01:13:08,330 --> 01:13:12,101
[chuckles] As Cr-Craig Sheeran

1462
01:13:12,134 --> 01:13:15,071
so eloquently said,
"People respect facts."

1463
01:13:15,104 --> 01:13:16,806
You tend to lean away from them.

1464
01:13:19,641 --> 01:13:21,143
What are you, meshugenah?

1465
01:13:23,179 --> 01:13:25,247
A meshugenah idiot.

1466
01:13:26,849 --> 01:13:29,251
Your first hit.

1467
01:13:29,285 --> 01:13:33,089
You lasted one hour
at a real job. You suck.

1468
01:13:34,223 --> 01:13:35,291
Shut up.

1469
01:13:41,163 --> 01:13:43,132
Zac?

1470
01:13:43,165 --> 01:13:46,268
What really happened the night
you beat up Craig Sheeran?

1471
01:13:50,239 --> 01:13:52,374
It was my fault.

1472
01:13:52,408 --> 01:13:55,144
I was angry. I was stupid.

1473
01:14:02,885 --> 01:14:04,186
He gave me a bad review.

1474
01:14:06,789 --> 01:14:08,057
He mocked my film.

1475
01:14:09,859 --> 01:14:12,728
Said I couldn't direct a drama
if it would save my life.

1476
01:14:18,834 --> 01:14:20,803
I swore that if I ever
met him in person,

1477
01:14:20,836 --> 01:14:22,404
I would punch him
right in the fuckin' face.

1478
01:14:23,272 --> 01:14:24,639
And you did.

1479
01:14:25,673 --> 01:14:28,777
Yeah, well unfortunately I was
at a party when I met him,

1480
01:14:29,211 --> 01:14:31,080
after I'd done
a shit ton of coke.

1481
01:14:36,218 --> 01:14:38,087
All of a sudden,
he was on the ground.

1482
01:14:40,055 --> 01:14:42,224
Blood coming out of his nose
and everything.

1483
01:14:44,193 --> 01:14:46,428
Right then and there I knew
I had to turn my life around.

1484
01:14:49,431 --> 01:14:51,100
Checked into rehab

1485
01:14:52,835 --> 01:14:54,904
and never touched drugs since.

1486
01:14:54,937 --> 01:14:57,373
And never directed a drama
since either.

1487
01:14:59,308 --> 01:15:01,710
Well, I guess I don't want
to take any more risks.

1488
01:15:02,144 --> 01:15:05,114
But isn't life
about taking risks?

1489

[romantic music plays]

1490
01:15:25,167 --> 01:15:27,770
You're taking her
to the premiere?

1491
01:15:27,803 --> 01:15:30,005
- Uh-huh.
- You can't do that.

1492
01:15:30,472 --> 01:15:33,342
- Why not? We're dating.
- What about Isabella?

1493
01:15:33,375 --> 01:15:34,977
What about Isabella?

1494
01:15:35,010 --> 01:15:36,779
Haven't seen or talked
to her in months.

1495
01:15:36,812 --> 01:15:38,814
Zac, I know the public
better than you,

1496
01:15:38,847 --> 01:15:40,883
and this is your comeback movie.

1497
01:15:40,916 --> 01:15:42,518
If they think
you've mistreated Isabella

1498
01:15:42,551 --> 01:15:44,386
- they're going to boycott it.
- Grant.

1499

I'm serious.

otherwise they might pull out.

They're not gonna pull out.
We still have Ethan Burns.

Oh, yeah. Thank God,

after that girl
nearly broke his face.

1505
01:15:59,468 --> 01:16:01,971
Will you shut up. You're pissing
me off more than usual.

I don't know
what you see in her, man.

I mean, she's not gorgeous.
She can barely act.

You are going to the premiere
with Isabella.

We need <i>Deadly Games</i> to sell.

any more accurate

- than his last one?
- Harold, there were

1520
01:16:39,174 --> 01:16:43,479
historically inaccurate movies
made before 1960.

1521
01:16:43,512 --> 01:16:45,247
Yes, but they had talent.

1522
01:16:45,281 --> 01:16:46,949
Zac has talent.

1523
01:16:49,118 --> 01:16:50,185
How do I look?

Is this the woman
who ruined your marriage?

Strange to think

1548
01:18:11,033 --> 01:18:12,401
if I hadn't said
anything to Zac,

1549
01:18:12,434 --> 01:18:14,370
he never would
have taken you on.

1550
01:18:14,403 --> 01:18:16,972
He didn't want to work with you
to begin with.

1551
01:18:17,005 --> 01:18:20,676
He thought
you had no talent at all.

1552
01:18:20,710 --> 01:18:23,278
Until we made that bet,
of course.

1553
01:18:23,312 --> 01:18:24,513
What?

1554
01:18:24,546 --> 01:18:26,582
- He didn't tell you?
- No.

1555
01:18:26,615 --> 01:18:28,685
He had no intention
of casting you.

1556
01:18:28,718 --> 01:18:31,520
He, uh, just really wanted
Ethan Burns,

1557
01:18:31,553 --> 01:18:34,189
until I said,
as a joke you know,

1558
01:18:34,223 --> 01:18:36,558
if he could get a performance
out of you,

1559
01:18:36,592 --> 01:18:38,627
I'd get Ethan to do this film.

1560
01:18:38,660 --> 01:18:41,130
It was just a joke.

1561
01:18:41,163 --> 01:18:42,664
I didn't think he could do it,

1562
01:18:42,699 --> 01:18:45,434
but old Zaccie
managed to pull it off.

1563
01:18:47,269 --> 01:18:49,004
Jodea, are you in love with Zac?

1564
01:18:50,639 --> 01:18:52,174
Can you comment on the affair?

1565
01:18:52,207 --> 01:18:54,109
How long
has it been going on for?

1566
01:18:57,346 --> 01:18:58,981
[crowd chatter]

1567
01:18:59,749 --> 01:19:02,951
Zac. Not a bad movie.

1568
01:19:02,985 --> 01:19:06,155
Craig Sheeran. Nice to see you.

1569
01:19:06,188 --> 01:19:08,257
Maybe one of these days
you'll make a movie

1570
01:19:08,290 --> 01:19:11,260
where you know something
about the subject matter.

1571
01:19:11,293 --> 01:19:13,662
Well, since the movie's
about a reformed drug addict

1572
01:19:13,696 --> 01:19:15,664
who beats up fuckwads,

1573
01:19:15,698 --> 01:19:18,735
I think I know more than enough
about the subject matter.

1574
01:19:18,768 --> 01:19:20,502
- You can ride with me.
- Thanks.

1575
01:19:20,536 --> 01:19:22,571
But I don't want to get in a car
with Zac right now.

1576
01:19:24,774 --> 01:19:26,442
What?

1577
01:19:26,475 --> 01:19:28,577
- I'm sorry.
- Sorry for what?

1578
01:19:28,610 --> 01:19:31,013
For the fact
that I was part of a bet?

1579
01:19:31,046 --> 01:19:33,982
All that stuff you told me
about thinking I had potential,

1580
01:19:34,016 --> 01:19:35,517
about seeing
the passion in my eyes,

1581
01:19:35,551 --> 01:19:37,186
that was all lies, huh?

1582
01:19:37,219 --> 01:19:39,087
I did see something
I liked about you, okay?

1583
01:19:39,121 --> 01:19:40,656
The day that you auditioned
for me.

1584
01:19:40,690 --> 01:19:43,125
But it was the bet that made you
take me on, right?

1585
01:19:43,158 --> 01:19:45,527
Not the fact
you thought I had potential?

1586
01:19:45,561 --> 01:19:47,362
I do think you have potential.

1587
01:19:47,396 --> 01:19:48,731
I saw something inside you,

1588
01:19:48,765 --> 01:19:51,200
something I know
will take you places.

1589
01:19:51,233 --> 01:19:54,704
Right then and there,
I knew I wanted you in my film.

1590
01:19:54,737 --> 01:19:58,006
And what was with saying
I'm just some dumb actress

1591
01:19:58,040 --> 01:20:01,176
who needed a ride in your limo,
and you're still with Isabella?

1592
01:20:01,210 --> 01:20:04,714
I wasn't prepared
for the questions. I panicked.

1593
01:20:04,747 --> 01:20:07,616
Please, Jodea.
What was I supposed to say?

1594
01:20:07,649 --> 01:20:09,686
Could have told the truth
about it.

1595
01:20:09,719 --> 01:20:11,487
Fred, can you go back
to your fucking car

1596
01:20:11,520 --> 01:20:13,756
and go home? Please?

1597
01:20:13,790 --> 01:20:15,591
- I'll be in the car.
- Okay. Thanks, Fred.

1598
01:20:18,761 --> 01:20:24,366
Listen, I'm sorry that
I behaved like a total jerk,

1599
01:20:24,399 --> 01:20:27,770
but please,
please try to understand.

1600
01:20:27,804 --> 01:20:30,405
Know what, Zac? I do understand.

1601
01:20:30,439 --> 01:20:33,208
When you took me on I thought,
"Wow, here's someone

1602
01:20:33,242 --> 01:20:35,611
so different from everyone else
in this world."

1603
01:20:35,644 --> 01:20:38,480
And I thought you were someone
who is truly passionate

1604
01:20:38,514 --> 01:20:40,449
about what you did.

1605
01:20:40,482 --> 01:20:42,117
But I was wrong.

1606
01:20:42,150 --> 01:20:44,586
[sad piano music]

1607
01:20:47,155 --> 01:20:48,257
[sighs]

1608
01:20:49,525 --> 01:20:51,560
Suppose I'm more
than just her landlord.

1609
01:20:51,593 --> 01:20:53,796
She's lived here
for nearly seven years.

1610
01:20:53,830 --> 01:20:57,099
She's a jolly good actress.
Here she is. Here she is.

1611
01:20:57,132 --> 01:20:58,400
[reporters calling]

1612

[talking simultaneously]

1613
01:21:11,246 --> 01:21:14,650
You know, your whole truth
is already within you.

1614
01:21:14,684 --> 01:21:17,486
Here's my card. Keith from
the Church of Scientology.

1615
01:21:18,888 --> 01:21:20,489
[reporters yelling]

1616
01:21:21,858 --> 01:21:25,394
Zac, the public is going
with Isabella on this.

1617
01:21:25,427 --> 01:21:27,095
Yeah.

1618
01:21:27,129 --> 01:21:30,165
They're bringing out
the drug stories again.

1619
01:21:30,198 --> 01:21:32,234
What the hell do you want me
to do about it, Grant?

1620
01:21:32,267 --> 01:21:34,570
I'd like you to take this girl,
have your affair with her

1621
01:21:34,603 --> 01:21:37,439
- and lay low.
- There is no affair.

1622
01:21:37,472 --> 01:21:39,608
- She broke it off.
- [chuckles]

1623
01:21:39,641 --> 01:21:41,476
We'll put out a press release.

1624
01:21:41,510 --> 01:21:43,278
Tell everybody it was a mistake.

1625
01:21:43,312 --> 01:21:45,113
What the fuck difference
does it make?

1626
01:21:45,147 --> 01:21:46,749
They're gonna find out
about the divorce

1627
01:21:46,783 --> 01:21:47,784
one way or the other.

1628
01:21:47,817 --> 01:21:49,886
Divorce? No.

1629
01:21:49,919 --> 01:21:52,254
Zac, you need
to patch things up.

1630
01:21:52,287 --> 01:21:56,258
What? Forget about it, Grant.
Okay? It's over.

1631
01:21:56,291 --> 01:21:59,661
It's critical the public sees
that you weren't cheating.

1632
01:21:59,696 --> 01:22:01,363
All right. Enough, okay?

1633
01:22:01,396 --> 01:22:03,332
I don't wanna talk
about this anymore, okay?

1634
01:22:03,365 --> 01:22:05,367
Let's just talk about the movie.

1635
01:22:05,400 --> 01:22:06,435
Okay.

1636
01:22:08,270 --> 01:22:10,707
I was thinking
for the lead role, Amanda.

1637
01:22:10,740 --> 01:22:12,674
Jodea's playing the lead role.

1638
01:22:12,709 --> 01:22:14,209
Zac, you can't do this.

1639
01:22:14,242 --> 01:22:16,211
You cannot cast her
in this film.

1640
01:22:16,244 --> 01:22:18,647
She can't carry a movie.
She can't open a movie.

1641
01:22:18,681 --> 01:22:20,515
She's not a name.

1642
01:22:20,549 --> 01:22:24,286
Well, my mind's made up,
so if you don't like it tough.

1643
01:22:27,389 --> 01:22:31,526
This is a $10,000 collectible.

1644
01:22:31,560 --> 01:22:34,363
Come on, Zac.
This is your career.

1645
01:22:34,396 --> 01:22:38,467
You cast her and you're
jeopardizing the film.

1646
01:22:38,500 --> 01:22:40,937
And the public's gonna know
that you were cheating.

1647
01:22:40,970 --> 01:22:42,772
Fuck the public!

1648
01:22:43,773 --> 01:22:45,708
Zac.

1649
01:22:45,742 --> 01:22:47,442
- Zac!
- [door closes]

1650
01:22:47,476 --> 01:22:50,278
How many marriages
have you wrecked in Hollywood?

1651
01:22:50,312 --> 01:22:53,582
- Oh, my God. That's her.
- Oh, the home-wrecker

1652
01:22:53,615 --> 01:22:55,752
I can't believe she did that.

1653
01:22:55,785 --> 01:22:57,619
Oh, my God.
I saw Isabella's Twitter.

1654
01:22:57,653 --> 01:22:59,822
She's heartbroken.

1655
01:22:59,856 --> 01:23:02,591
- Lois.
- Yes, sir.

1656
01:23:02,624 --> 01:23:05,227
You don't happen to have
that Jody girl's number, do you?

1657
01:23:05,260 --> 01:23:06,763
That'll be two fifty.

1658
01:23:10,399 --> 01:23:11,433
Thank you.

- [giggling]

1661
01:23:19,608 --> 01:23:20,910
Keep it.

1662
01:23:20,943 --> 01:23:22,979
Maybe for a better haircut.

1663
01:23:23,012 --> 01:23:25,715
You're the one having an affair
with Zac Kawalsky.

1664
01:23:25,748 --> 01:23:27,684
I'm sorry. I think
you have the wrong person.

1665
01:23:27,717 --> 01:23:31,653
No. Your name's Jodea, right?

1666
01:23:31,688 --> 01:23:33,588
[phone ringing]

1667
01:23:33,622 --> 01:23:35,758
- Hello.
- Jodea?

1668
01:23:35,792 --> 01:23:38,660
- Grant Garino.
- Yeah.

1669
01:23:38,695 --> 01:23:40,495
Hi. I just wanted
to let you know

1670
01:23:40,529 --> 01:23:44,599
that Zac and I were discussing
the next film,

1671
01:23:44,633 --> 01:23:49,337
<i>and we didn't really think
that you should participate.</i>

1672
01:23:49,371 --> 01:23:51,606
You know, there's so much
scandal around you right now

1673
01:23:51,640 --> 01:23:53,542
that I don't think
it's a good idea

1674
01:23:53,575 --> 01:23:56,012
<i>if you contact him as well.</i>

1675
01:23:56,045 --> 01:23:59,716
<i>You see, Zac and Isabella
are back together again.</i>

1676
01:24:00,850 --> 01:24:02,217
Fuck you.

1677
01:24:06,421 --> 01:24:07,489
Hello?

1678
01:24:09,458 --> 01:24:10,492
[huffs]

1679
01:24:22,939 --> 01:24:24,339
[phone rings]

1680
01:24:26,641 --> 01:24:28,577
- What the hell is going on?
- Jodea, hey.

1681
01:24:28,610 --> 01:24:29,879
I was just
about to come see you.

1682
01:24:29,912 --> 01:24:31,781
- Well don't.
- Will you just listen

1683
01:24:31,814 --> 01:24:33,615
- for a fucking second?
- No, I can't.

1684
01:24:33,648 --> 01:24:34,951
Stay the hell out of my life,
Zac.

1685
01:24:39,421 --> 01:24:40,757
What the hell were you thinking,

1686
01:24:40,790 --> 01:24:42,692
talking to those reporters
about me?

1687
01:24:44,326 --> 01:24:46,294
Jodes,
I thought you'd appreciate

1688
01:24:46,328 --> 01:24:47,864
- the fame a bit longer.
- That I'd appreciate...

1689
01:24:47,897 --> 01:24:51,333
What were you thinking?
Harold, don't you get it?

1690
01:24:51,366 --> 01:24:53,736
You can't do that.

1691
01:24:53,770 --> 01:24:56,038
Jodes, I'm sorry.

1692
01:24:56,072 --> 01:24:57,707
I didn't mean to upset you.
Just go.

1693
01:24:57,740 --> 01:24:59,976
- I can't talk to you right now.
- Aw, Jodes.

1694
01:25:00,009 --> 01:25:02,577
I'm sorry.

1695

- Excuse me.
- [Jodea] Just hold on a minute.

01:25:22,631 --> 01:25:25,300
Yeah. Can I take a picture
with you, please?
