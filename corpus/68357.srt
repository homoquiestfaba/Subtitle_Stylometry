1
00:00:31,564 --> 00:00:38,117
Your attention, please. Flight 217
from Venice, ltaly, now arriving at Gate 34.

2
00:00:38,204 --> 00:00:41,958
Please claim all baggage
at carousel number two...

3
00:01:12,884 --> 00:01:14,363
Hot! Hot!

4
00:01:44,044 --> 00:01:45,636
I'll be by tomorrow for my stuff.

5
00:01:46,524 --> 00:01:50,563
Call first, cos I might be having sex
with a complete stranger!

6
00:01:53,564 --> 00:01:56,522
45 minutes for a cab. This is ridiculous.

7
00:01:56,604 --> 00:01:58,037
Cheese and rice!

8
00:02:02,884 --> 00:02:07,480
Boy, you got it in there, didn't you, honey?
Thank you so much!

9
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:13,637
I need a ride.

10
00:02:13,724 --> 00:02:15,715
Get out of my way.

11
00:02:32,964 --> 00:02:34,761
Get in!

12
00:02:46,124 --> 00:02:48,479
Try and keep it on the road for a change.

13
00:03:01,124 --> 00:03:04,878
- Can't you get it any closer?
- I don't wanna scratch the paint.

14
00:03:14,484 --> 00:03:16,600
What do you do here, Tom Leezak?

15
00:03:16,684 --> 00:03:17,912
Open the gate, Yuan.

16
00:03:18,004 --> 00:03:20,757
You and Tom not together any more.

17
00:03:20,844 --> 00:03:23,483
Just open the gate, Yuan!

18
00:03:42,244 --> 00:03:43,836
That one looks heavy.

19
00:03:47,604 --> 00:03:49,879
Get thatjunk wagon out of here.

20
00:03:49,964 --> 00:03:51,761
Right away, princess!

21
00:04:04,724 --> 00:04:06,919
Not one word.

22
00:04:08,804 --> 00:04:12,513
- Are Mom and Dad home?
- No, they're at the Emphysema Ball.

23
00:04:12,604 --> 00:04:16,233
Don't worry, Peewee.
We'll get this Tom mess cleaned up.

24
00:04:20,364 --> 00:04:21,797
Sarah...

25
00:04:33,804 --> 00:04:36,398
Kyle...

26
00:04:49,644 --> 00:04:53,273
OK, I'm home, so you can
leave whenever you want.

27
00:05:11,604 --> 00:05:14,437
This is Tom and Sarah.
We can't come to the phone

28
00:05:14,524 --> 00:05:16,958
because we're honeymooning in Europe!

29
00:05:17,044 --> 00:05:21,481
Send a large wedding gift,
or we won't call you back. I'm serious.

30
00:05:22,884 --> 00:05:26,035
Kyle. I got your message.
Sorry the honeymoon sucked.

31
00:05:26,124 --> 00:05:31,152
Anyway, don't wig. When you get back,
we'll do some Budweiser therapy.

32
00:05:32,404 --> 00:05:35,601
Hi, Sarah, it's Peter.
I thought I might catch you in.

33
00:05:35,684 --> 00:05:39,233
Tom, ifyou're listening, buddy,
I feel your pain.

34
00:05:46,804 --> 00:05:51,434
- Where you been, man? You're on in five.
- I walked over. I had to clear my head.

35
00:05:51,524 --> 00:05:53,401
So? What happened?

36
00:05:53,484 --> 00:05:57,443
Well, I had the perfect relationship
that was ruined by marriage.

37
00:05:57,524 --> 00:06:01,358
You saw it, right? We were perfect
from the minute we met. Right?

38
00:06:01,444 --> 00:06:05,357
Yeah. In fact, it was nauseating.

39
00:06:06,084 --> 00:06:07,642
Thank you, Fred.

40
00:06:12,404 --> 00:06:15,714
Blue 28! Blue 28!

41
00:06:15,804 --> 00:06:18,602
Set! Hut!

42
00:06:20,044 --> 00:06:21,762
I'm open! I'm open!

43
00:06:24,524 --> 00:06:26,082
Football!

44
00:06:30,644 --> 00:06:31,793
Sorry!

45
00:06:33,284 --> 00:06:34,683
Are you OK?

46
00:06:34,764 --> 00:06:37,562
Yeah. You had nothin' on it.

47
00:06:43,964 --> 00:06:46,603
Cheers, Sarah McNerney.

48
00:06:46,684 --> 00:06:49,198
Cheers, Tom Leezak.

49
00:06:52,244 --> 00:06:54,917
So, what do you do
when you're not Joe Montana?

50
00:06:55,004 --> 00:06:57,882
I work at KNR Radio,

51
00:06:57,964 --> 00:07:01,001
your traffic information station.

52
00:07:01,844 --> 00:07:04,278
So I have myself a real live radio host?

53
00:07:04,364 --> 00:07:08,357
No. Someday I'll be that guy.
Sports, hopefully.

54
00:07:08,444 --> 00:07:11,083
Right now, I just do spot traffic reports.

55
00:07:11,164 --> 00:07:14,554
On the graveyard shift. Every other week.

56
00:07:14,644 --> 00:07:17,556
When the full-time guy's sick.

57
00:07:17,644 --> 00:07:20,681
- You're that Tom.
- Yeah. You heard me on the air?

58
00:07:20,764 --> 00:07:23,836
Yeah, I called in about a week ago.
Like, 3am.

59
00:07:23,924 --> 00:07:26,961
You said the Pasadena freeway
was clear, so I took it,

60
00:07:27,044 --> 00:07:33,040
and got stuck behind ajackknifed big rig
for, like, three hours. Yeah.

61
00:07:33,124 --> 00:07:35,160
Sarah from Beverly Hills.

62
00:07:36,044 --> 00:07:38,797
Who called me a fathead.

63
00:07:39,564 --> 00:07:41,680
We got pretty heated.

64
00:07:41,764 --> 00:07:43,197
Very heated.

65
00:07:45,684 --> 00:07:48,676
So, 3am? That's past your bedtime, is it?

66
00:07:48,764 --> 00:07:53,394
How do you know? I was wrapping out
an auction. I'm a gofer at Sotheby's.

67
00:07:53,484 --> 00:07:58,000
Let me guess: marketing major, Stanford.
Smartypants in the front row.

68
00:07:58,084 --> 00:08:01,759
- Art history major, Wellesley, back row.
- Oh, back row.

69
00:08:01,844 --> 00:08:05,314
Sweet! Me too. Communications,
Burbank Community College.

70
00:08:05,404 --> 00:08:07,599
- Wanna hear the fight song?
- No, thank you.

71
00:08:07,684 --> 00:08:09,959
- I'm really good at it.
- No, really. Thanks.

72
00:08:10,044 --> 00:08:12,035
That's a good choice.

73
00:08:13,004 --> 00:08:15,154
McNerney.

74
00:08:15,244 --> 00:08:19,522
You're not, by any chance,
the daughter of Dan McNerney,

75
00:08:19,604 --> 00:08:23,597
part-owner-of-the-Lakers-and-Dodgers
McNerney?

76
00:08:24,564 --> 00:08:26,316
I'll take that as a yes.

77
00:08:26,884 --> 00:08:29,273
Ready to get your ass kicked at eight-ball?

78
00:08:30,924 --> 00:08:34,883
You are dreaming, Wellesley.
I went to day care in a pool hall.

79
00:08:35,684 --> 00:08:37,675
Pretty confident there, huh, fathead?

80
00:08:45,044 --> 00:08:47,512
Bags, shh.

81
00:09:29,004 --> 00:09:32,440
And that was it.
A month later, we moved in together.

82
00:09:33,844 --> 00:09:38,360
Why did we get married when we had loving
each other so completely nailed?

83
00:09:38,444 --> 00:09:40,355
I don't know. Ten seconds.

84
00:09:40,444 --> 00:09:42,002
Why does anyone get married?

85
00:09:42,084 --> 00:09:47,363
I mean, does it make sense to be
with one person for your entire life?

86
00:09:48,444 --> 00:09:51,083
People change. They grow.

87
00:09:51,164 --> 00:09:52,199
You're on, Tom.

88
00:09:53,004 --> 00:09:57,122
Maybe we'd still be together if I'd
gotten the proposal right, but, nope,

89
00:09:57,204 --> 00:09:59,672
the proposal is critical, and I blew it.

90
00:10:05,244 --> 00:10:11,240
This is Tom Leezak
with KNR traffic at 2.06am.

91
00:10:11,324 --> 00:10:16,557
At this hour, there are approximately
seven vehicles on all Southland freeways,

92
00:10:16,644 --> 00:10:21,274
so ifyou feel like skateboarding
down the 405, she's wide-open.

93
00:10:21,364 --> 00:10:24,754
Stay tuned for another
traffic update in ten minutes

94
00:10:24,844 --> 00:10:29,998
on KNR, your traffic information station.

95
00:10:31,004 --> 00:10:34,679
And we're out. Look here, Tom.
You gotta focus, all right, man?

96
00:10:35,204 --> 00:10:38,913
Forget about proposals.
Forget about marriage. All right?

97
00:10:45,764 --> 00:10:47,243
Bags...

98
00:10:49,924 --> 00:10:54,600
Do you have to grunt all the time?
You're just like a little pig with hair.

99
00:10:56,164 --> 00:10:59,520
Look at me.
I'm the cutest doggy in the world.

100
00:10:59,604 --> 00:11:04,724
I'm the cutest doggy in the world. Throw
the ball for me. I'll pull on your leg all day.

101
00:11:04,804 --> 00:11:07,364
Bags, seriously, I will...

102
00:11:07,444 --> 00:11:09,036
Bags, I'm reading.

103
00:11:12,924 --> 00:11:14,403
Fetch.

104
00:11:24,764 --> 00:11:27,073
It wasn't like Bags to chase pigeons.

105
00:11:29,764 --> 00:11:32,597
This pigeon was cruel. It was...

106
00:11:34,324 --> 00:11:38,476
Bags, he just went for him.

107
00:11:39,564 --> 00:11:41,555
He was taunting.

108
00:11:43,044 --> 00:11:46,514
And squawking.

109
00:11:46,604 --> 00:11:49,243
Squawking?

110
00:11:49,324 --> 00:11:51,679
Squawking.

111
00:11:51,764 --> 00:11:55,040
I mean, at first, it was more of a purring.

112
00:11:56,204 --> 00:11:59,276
You know how they...
I mean, Bags... It got his attention.

113
00:11:59,364 --> 00:12:01,798
He has a low tolerance for annoyances.

114
00:12:01,884 --> 00:12:05,001
But then it turned into this, like, shrill...

115
00:12:17,044 --> 00:12:19,035
You're lying.

116
00:12:20,004 --> 00:12:23,519
- What?
- Your nostrils always flare when you lie.

117
00:12:23,604 --> 00:12:25,754
Flare! Flare!

118
00:12:25,844 --> 00:12:29,473
They're not flaring. I'm not lying.

119
00:12:33,324 --> 00:12:38,159
Honey, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I'm just really overwhelmed.

120
00:12:39,564 --> 00:12:42,476
Promise we'll never lie to each other.

121
00:12:44,844 --> 00:12:47,199
It's a promise.

122
00:12:53,404 --> 00:12:55,838
I love you so much.

123
00:13:01,604 --> 00:13:03,754
Listen, Sarah...

124
00:13:04,284 --> 00:13:07,117
I wanna marry you, Tom Leezak.

125
00:13:09,844 --> 00:13:11,880
I wanna marry you, too.

126
00:13:22,924 --> 00:13:26,917
Why do you bring Dodge to front?
Park at service entrance!

127
00:13:27,004 --> 00:13:29,518
Open the gate, Yuan.

128
00:13:31,004 --> 00:13:32,403
Here we go!

129
00:13:45,124 --> 00:13:47,684
Well, well, well...

130
00:13:49,724 --> 00:13:52,033
What a surprise.

131
00:14:00,164 --> 00:14:03,952
- Welcome to the family, Tom.
- Thank you, Mrs McNerney.

132
00:14:04,324 --> 00:14:06,280
Oh, you can call me Pussy now.

133
00:14:06,364 --> 00:14:09,754
Thank you, Pussy.

134
00:14:09,844 --> 00:14:13,803
Well, wonderful. Wonderful!

135
00:14:13,884 --> 00:14:16,352
Yuan, champagne for everybody!

136
00:14:18,204 --> 00:14:19,842
Knock it off, Dickie!

137
00:14:21,084 --> 00:14:25,635
Peewee. My youngest daughter.

138
00:14:25,724 --> 00:14:27,999
You little rebel.

139
00:14:29,044 --> 00:14:32,081
And you, Tom Leezak. You're...

140
00:14:32,884 --> 00:14:35,603
Well, wonderful surprise.

141
00:14:36,444 --> 00:14:38,514
Thank you, Mr McNerney.

142
00:14:38,604 --> 00:14:42,153
I just hope that I can

143
00:14:42,244 --> 00:14:46,317
be just all that I can be

144
00:14:48,004 --> 00:14:50,962
in this family.

145
00:14:57,204 --> 00:15:00,401
Well, I love Sarah.

146
00:15:00,484 --> 00:15:02,236
That's all I need to know.

147
00:15:04,084 --> 00:15:07,156
You really missed the boat,
didn't you, Prentiss?

148
00:15:07,244 --> 00:15:08,313
Yes, I did, Dan.

149
00:15:08,404 --> 00:15:10,713
You bet your ass you did.

150
00:15:10,804 --> 00:15:15,275
I should've been courting Sarah instead
of putting in 19-hour days at the office.

151
00:15:15,364 --> 00:15:19,073
Anyway, congratulations. To both ofyou.

152
00:15:19,164 --> 00:15:21,473
Seriously, from my heart.

153
00:15:21,564 --> 00:15:23,555
Thank you, Peter.

154
00:15:24,404 --> 00:15:27,680
- You're a lucky man.
- Hey, I know that.

155
00:15:27,764 --> 00:15:29,755
Grab a flute of bubbly and rise.

156
00:15:32,524 --> 00:15:34,355
Everybody ready?

157
00:15:34,724 --> 00:15:38,433
- Why is Peter Prentiss here?
- Dad's doing business with him.

158
00:15:38,524 --> 00:15:41,755
All right. Health, wealth, happiness.

159
00:15:41,844 --> 00:15:44,312
Health, wealth, happiness.

160
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:48,641
All right, Peewee. Ten-yard out.

161
00:15:48,724 --> 00:15:54,082
Leezak, give me a five-yard slant.
You got this, man. Don't worry about it.

162
00:15:54,164 --> 00:15:56,234
- Calm down.
- What do you mean, calm down?

163
00:15:56,324 --> 00:16:01,079
Why do bad things happen to good people,
Father? Where's that in your book?

164
00:16:01,164 --> 00:16:03,394
- She's determined.
- Not even Catholic!

165
00:16:03,484 --> 00:16:07,238
- He's a Polack! A Polack.
- I know, and I warned you...

166
00:16:07,324 --> 00:16:09,554
Let's see what Leezak's packing.

167
00:16:09,644 --> 00:16:12,204
Ready? All right. And break!

168
00:16:12,764 --> 00:16:14,755
- On one. Ready?
- Break!

169
00:16:18,484 --> 00:16:20,998
You girls ready for this?

170
00:16:22,564 --> 00:16:23,758
Down!

171
00:16:25,924 --> 00:16:26,913
Set!

172
00:16:32,004 --> 00:16:33,642
That was a hard one.

173
00:16:34,364 --> 00:16:36,320
- Yeah!
- That's what I'm talkin' about!

174
00:16:36,404 --> 00:16:38,474
- What are you doing, Willie?
- I slipped.

175
00:16:40,284 --> 00:16:43,879
I still got my flag. I'm good. I'm good.

176
00:16:45,204 --> 00:16:48,241
Oh, my Peewee. Always moving so fast.

177
00:16:48,324 --> 00:16:53,159
You move in together after a month,
live together for nine months,

178
00:16:53,244 --> 00:16:55,712
and now you're engaged.

179
00:16:55,804 --> 00:16:58,364
I know you love him, but, you know,

180
00:16:58,444 --> 00:17:03,199
sometimes it takes more than love
to sustain a marriage.

181
00:17:04,804 --> 00:17:07,238
You need to be old enough
to know who you are

182
00:17:07,324 --> 00:17:09,360
and what you want and who he is.

183
00:17:09,444 --> 00:17:12,834
Oh, Mom, he's wild and spontaneous

184
00:17:12,924 --> 00:17:15,358
and hysterical and offbeat,

185
00:17:15,444 --> 00:17:19,153
and on top of all that,
he's centred, and he's down-to-earth.

186
00:17:19,244 --> 00:17:23,476
He's everything I want. And we have
this passion for each other that's...

187
00:17:27,964 --> 00:17:29,761
I'm jealous.

188
00:17:31,604 --> 00:17:34,721
All right. First thing tomorrow,

189
00:17:37,044 --> 00:17:39,433
we're gonna plan this wedding!

190
00:18:03,004 --> 00:18:04,198
Hey, you.

191
00:18:18,724 --> 00:18:21,875
So I guess everyone thinks
we're crazy for doing this.

192
00:18:21,964 --> 00:18:25,354
Now when did we start caring
about what other people think?

193
00:18:27,164 --> 00:18:32,602
Well, are you sure that you don't
wanna marry a guy like Peter?

194
00:18:33,884 --> 00:18:39,356
If I wanted to know exactly what
my life would be from hereon out,

195
00:18:39,444 --> 00:18:42,800
I would marry a guy like Peter.

196
00:18:42,884 --> 00:18:45,478
But I love not knowing.

197
00:18:45,564 --> 00:18:51,036
I love our messy loft, your beater car.

198
00:18:53,884 --> 00:18:56,637
I wanna start a life with you.

199
00:18:56,724 --> 00:18:58,077
Sarah?

200
00:18:58,164 --> 00:19:00,359
Go! Go!

201
00:19:03,804 --> 00:19:05,635
Hi, Daddy.

202
00:19:09,564 --> 00:19:14,922
Peewee, marriage is like
a business investment.

203
00:19:15,004 --> 00:19:20,761
Its long-term viability
is best established unemotionally.

204
00:19:20,844 --> 00:19:25,599
Bottom line, Daddy: we love each other.
That is all that matters.

205
00:19:40,404 --> 00:19:41,519
Good night, sir.

206
00:19:45,324 --> 00:19:47,679
Congratulations, Mr Leezak!

207
00:19:47,764 --> 00:19:50,915
Big Daddy Leezak's in the house!

208
00:19:52,844 --> 00:19:55,312
Oh, I hope she doesn't spook on you, man.

209
00:19:56,164 --> 00:19:57,643
What do you mean?

210
00:19:57,724 --> 00:20:02,195
I love Sarah, don't get me wrong.
But rich chicks spook.

211
00:20:02,284 --> 00:20:06,323
A powerful daddy plus family money
equals expectations.

212
00:20:06,404 --> 00:20:09,635
Expectations are like
a fungal rot on a marriage.

213
00:20:10,644 --> 00:20:13,602
Our marriage is not gonna have a fungal rot.

214
00:20:13,684 --> 00:20:17,393
We're gonna be happily married
every day for the rest of our lives.

215
00:20:18,684 --> 00:20:22,723
Unless she finds out
that you slaughtered her dog.

216
00:20:22,804 --> 00:20:24,635
I'll take that to my grave.

217
00:20:30,804 --> 00:20:35,161
OK, ifyou change your mind
at the altar, just pass out.

218
00:20:35,244 --> 00:20:37,678
I'm not going to change my mind.

219
00:20:37,764 --> 00:20:40,995
I'm just saying, ifyou do, just hit the floor.

220
00:20:41,084 --> 00:20:43,598
Thank you. But it's not gonna happen.

221
00:20:44,204 --> 00:20:46,957
You're sure you're ready
to give up your grazing rights?

222
00:20:47,044 --> 00:20:48,682
I'm not a grazer, Kyle.

223
00:20:48,764 --> 00:20:51,039
What ifyou became one later in life?

224
00:20:51,124 --> 00:20:56,278
I mean, over the next ten years,
you're giving up five hayrides per year.

225
00:20:56,364 --> 00:21:00,403
So I can either be happily married
to Sarah, or have 50 one-night stands.

226
00:21:00,484 --> 00:21:04,079
- Minimum.
- That's not even a choice.

227
00:21:05,684 --> 00:21:08,437
OK, let's move on.

228
00:21:08,524 --> 00:21:12,153
Are there any chicks you didn't have
that you wish you had?

229
00:21:12,244 --> 00:21:14,439
You are, like, the worst best man ever!

230
00:21:14,524 --> 00:21:16,116
Peter!

231
00:21:18,164 --> 00:21:20,553
I can't believe she invited Prentiss.

232
00:21:20,644 --> 00:21:23,078
- Glad you made it, buddy.
- Hey, man.

233
00:21:23,164 --> 00:21:25,962
Did she ever hook up with that yahoo?

234
00:21:27,244 --> 00:21:30,873
They went backpacking in Europe once,
just after high school.

235
00:21:30,964 --> 00:21:33,478
I don't think anything happened.

236
00:21:33,564 --> 00:21:39,560
Whoa. You're getting married,
and she didn't share the roster?

237
00:21:41,444 --> 00:21:43,400
She shared the roster.

238
00:21:46,124 --> 00:21:49,241
Merrick and Bruce.

239
00:21:54,004 --> 00:21:55,835
What about Prentiss?

240
00:21:59,644 --> 00:22:02,238
And you never asked again?

241
00:22:02,324 --> 00:22:05,202
I won. It's irrelevant.

242
00:22:07,084 --> 00:22:12,716
Oh. OK. As long as you're OK
with a bogus roster.

243
00:22:12,804 --> 00:22:15,364
- It's not a bogus roster!
- Is he on or is he off?

244
00:22:15,444 --> 00:22:16,923
He's...

245
00:22:18,164 --> 00:22:20,155
- Shut up.
- Huh? Huh?

246
00:22:24,324 --> 00:22:25,837
And you could've had Peter.

247
00:22:25,924 --> 00:22:28,563
I did have Peter, and it wasn't that hot. OK?

248
00:22:30,284 --> 00:22:32,673
Excuse me?

249
00:22:32,764 --> 00:22:35,881
I was in Seattle, helping at an appraisal.

250
00:22:35,964 --> 00:22:39,434
Ran into Peter. We went out.
I drank way too much,

251
00:22:39,524 --> 00:22:44,200
and before I knew it, we tussled.

252
00:22:44,724 --> 00:22:47,238
You bad girl.

253
00:22:47,844 --> 00:22:51,439
I wanted to tell Tom so many times,
but he gets so jealous.

254
00:22:51,524 --> 00:22:54,243
Listen, it doesn't matter
that he doesn't know.

255
00:22:54,324 --> 00:22:56,997
It's not like you were married,
and even ifyou were...

256
00:22:57,084 --> 00:22:59,678
No, no, no. It matters to me.

257
00:22:59,764 --> 00:23:03,439
It's like living a lie. I cannot live a lie.

258
00:23:03,524 --> 00:23:07,483
There will always be this
big fat elephant in the room with us.

259
00:23:07,564 --> 00:23:10,124
Listen, Peewee, never tell him.

260
00:23:12,564 --> 00:23:14,122
It's time to go, Sarah.

261
00:23:15,684 --> 00:23:17,675
Come on.

262
00:23:18,804 --> 00:23:20,237
- Got everything?
- Yes.

263
00:23:20,324 --> 00:23:21,552
How are you holding up?

264
00:23:21,644 --> 00:23:24,522
Pussy's a mess.
I'm telling you now, be prepared.

265
00:23:59,684 --> 00:24:01,197
Wait.

266
00:24:09,044 --> 00:24:10,762
- Oh, are you OK?
- Yes.

267
00:24:10,844 --> 00:24:13,802
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

268
00:24:13,884 --> 00:24:16,637
This threshold thing isn't as easy as it looks.

269
00:24:24,484 --> 00:24:28,557
Daddy got the big suite! Yeah, he did!

270
00:24:35,964 --> 00:24:38,922
We're really married.
We're really, really married.

271
00:24:39,004 --> 00:24:40,995
For ever and ever.

272
00:24:43,564 --> 00:24:45,680
Do you feel like it?

273
00:24:45,764 --> 00:24:48,676
I don't know. Do you?

274
00:24:50,884 --> 00:24:53,273
I'm kinda tired.

275
00:24:54,364 --> 00:24:56,355
Me too.

276
00:24:57,404 --> 00:24:59,599
- I mean, hey...
- OK.

277
00:25:10,204 --> 00:25:12,195
What's the matter?

278
00:25:13,564 --> 00:25:16,636
It's our wedding night,
and we don't wanna have sex.

279
00:25:17,564 --> 00:25:20,556
No... Well, it's OK.

280
00:25:21,804 --> 00:25:24,921
We're tired. It's fine.

281
00:25:25,004 --> 00:25:27,564
Baby, it's just that this is our wedding day,

282
00:25:27,644 --> 00:25:30,397
something I've fantasised
about my whole life.

283
00:25:34,244 --> 00:25:36,599
And now it's over.

284
00:25:40,564 --> 00:25:44,193
Did you have wedding fantasies
when you were a little boy?

285
00:25:50,244 --> 00:25:51,597
Kinda.

286
00:25:51,684 --> 00:25:54,073
Oh, honey.

287
00:25:54,164 --> 00:25:58,362
Oh, my God! Tomorrow my parents
are gonna know I'm not a virgin any more!

288
00:26:00,484 --> 00:26:03,556
Oh... You haven't been
a virgin since college.

289
00:26:03,644 --> 00:26:08,160
I know. I know. But tomorrow they're
gonna know for sure that I'm not a virgin.

290
00:26:08,244 --> 00:26:12,522
And they're gonna know
that you deflowered me. Oh, God! Oh, no!

291
00:26:12,604 --> 00:26:14,322
- Oh, honey!
- Deflowered?

292
00:26:14,404 --> 00:26:17,282
That's what my mom always called it.
My mommy.

293
00:26:24,604 --> 00:26:27,516
I love you. OK?

294
00:26:27,604 --> 00:26:32,519
And we have our entire lives to have sex.

295
00:26:33,524 --> 00:26:36,960
So it's OK ifwe don't do it tonight.

296
00:26:42,644 --> 00:26:44,236
Now I kinda feel like it.

297
00:26:44,324 --> 00:26:46,713
- Really?
- Yeah.

298
00:26:46,804 --> 00:26:48,601
That was a sexy speech.

299
00:26:48,684 --> 00:26:52,518
I, you know, turn it on
every once in a while.

300
00:26:56,284 --> 00:26:58,275
Oh, bloody nose! Bloody nose!

301
00:26:58,364 --> 00:27:01,436
Oh, hello, hello! Hello, hello!

302
00:27:01,524 --> 00:27:03,515
Here you go.

303
00:27:05,804 --> 00:27:09,513
You've been mine for one night,
and you're falling apart already.

304
00:27:09,604 --> 00:27:12,198
I'm not gonna have to trade ya in, am l?

305
00:27:14,644 --> 00:27:18,193
There you go. Just like that.
It'll stop the bleeding.

306
00:27:20,444 --> 00:27:22,514
I look like a chimp.

307
00:27:24,444 --> 00:27:26,435
You look gorgeous.

308
00:27:28,284 --> 00:27:30,593
Let's go to sleep.

309
00:27:33,084 --> 00:27:35,882
- I love you.
- I love you, too, baby.

310
00:28:27,164 --> 00:28:29,598
Sweetie, our plane leaves in an hour.

311
00:28:35,924 --> 00:28:39,314
OK, so that wasn't
the smoothest start to a honeymoon.

312
00:28:40,164 --> 00:28:45,602
But tomorrow we will be at the foot
ofthe Alps at the Hôtel des Rêves.

313
00:28:45,684 --> 00:28:48,073
- Yes, we will.
- It'll be totally perfect.

314
00:28:48,164 --> 00:28:51,042
Yes, it sounds totally perfect.

315
00:28:53,884 --> 00:28:55,875
But I can't wait until then.

316
00:29:10,204 --> 00:29:12,195
Jimmy-crack-corn!

317
00:29:18,004 --> 00:29:20,040
Close it, bitch!

318
00:29:22,764 --> 00:29:25,198
There's a lock on the door
for a reason, Junior.

319
00:29:25,284 --> 00:29:27,752
I'm claustrophobic, OK?

320
00:29:27,844 --> 00:29:28,959
Do we have a problem?

321
00:29:29,044 --> 00:29:30,557
- No.
- No, no problem.

322
00:29:30,644 --> 00:29:32,362
- We're just waiting.
- Yeah.

323
00:29:41,804 --> 00:29:46,002
Mexican food. That's an oxymoron.

324
00:29:51,604 --> 00:29:54,357
Sweet Lord! Where does that come from?

325
00:29:54,444 --> 00:29:56,355
- Let's just wait.
- Oh, my gosh.

326
00:29:56,444 --> 00:29:59,959
..has turned on the "fasten seat belt" sign.

327
00:30:00,044 --> 00:30:02,000
Kindly return to your seats.

328
00:30:02,084 --> 00:30:05,759
OK... Breathe through your mouth.
Breathe through your mouth.

329
00:30:05,844 --> 00:30:08,039
- No, it's really bad.
- Just do it!

330
00:30:12,244 --> 00:30:13,393
Hurry up!

331
00:30:17,004 --> 00:30:19,359
OK, OK, let me just...

332
00:30:26,684 --> 00:30:29,198
This is gonna work. This is gonna work.

333
00:30:30,364 --> 00:30:33,197
- I'm gonna step on the toilet.
- OK, perfect.

334
00:30:42,324 --> 00:30:45,043
- What?
- The crapper's got my foot.

335
00:30:45,124 --> 00:30:47,001
- Wait. Let me help.
- Sarah...

336
00:30:47,084 --> 00:30:49,598
OK, OK, one, two, three.

337
00:30:54,964 --> 00:30:56,238
Return to your seats.

338
00:30:56,324 --> 00:30:58,633
- Be right out. OK, you OK?
- Yeah.

339
00:30:58,724 --> 00:31:01,875
OK, wait. OK, one, two, three.

340
00:31:02,844 --> 00:31:05,233
Return to your seats now, please.

341
00:31:05,324 --> 00:31:07,474
Beat it, stew!

342
00:31:09,804 --> 00:31:11,237
Return...

343
00:31:14,684 --> 00:31:19,360
Playtime is over, children.
Return to your seats! Do you hear me?

344
00:31:19,444 --> 00:31:21,082
- Let's flush it.
- I'll pull.

345
00:31:25,564 --> 00:31:26,792
I can't get it out!

346
00:31:26,884 --> 00:31:29,557
The captain has turned on
the "fasten seat belt" sign!

347
00:31:29,644 --> 00:31:32,397
Wait, wait, wait. Here.
Ready? One, two, three.

348
00:31:43,204 --> 00:31:47,720
- We can tell the grandchildren about that.
- Great story for the kids.

349
00:31:52,244 --> 00:31:54,394
- Bonjour.
- How you doing, chief?

350
00:31:54,484 --> 00:31:57,362
Can we get le car for Leezak?

351
00:31:58,524 --> 00:32:02,483
Bonjour. Les réservations sontpourLeezak.

352
00:32:02,564 --> 00:32:04,555
Oui, mademoiselle.

353
00:32:05,204 --> 00:32:09,482
- You never told me you spoke French.
- It was that summer I went to Europe.

354
00:32:09,564 --> 00:32:12,874
Ah, here we are. For Mr and Mrs Leezak.

355
00:32:12,964 --> 00:32:15,114
Must be some mistake, no?

356
00:32:15,204 --> 00:32:17,195
No, no mistake. Mr and Mrs.

357
00:32:19,164 --> 00:32:20,199
What the hell?

358
00:32:20,284 --> 00:32:23,321
- These sports scores are two days old.
- So?

359
00:32:23,404 --> 00:32:26,919
So? You know if I don't have
an up-to-date sports section,

360
00:32:27,004 --> 00:32:29,882
it throws off my day,
starting with my morning dump.

361
00:32:29,964 --> 00:32:33,195
Honey, there's gonna be
satellite TV in the hotel.

362
00:32:36,924 --> 00:32:38,198
Voilà.

363
00:32:38,284 --> 00:32:41,276
Ah. I wonder what kind ofwheels we got.

364
00:32:42,404 --> 00:32:45,953
I'm telling you, this is not the car.
I ordered a compact.

365
00:32:46,044 --> 00:32:47,523
This is a European compact.

366
00:32:47,604 --> 00:32:51,392
This is a Ringling Brothers compact.
I've owned bigger Tonka trucks.

367
00:32:51,484 --> 00:32:53,634
Honey, I looked at the brochure,

368
00:32:53,724 --> 00:32:58,354
and there was a Fiesta
on the cover, not a Bingo.

369
00:32:59,924 --> 00:33:02,961
Baby needs a great big car
to make him happy?

370
00:33:03,044 --> 00:33:06,036
We could really use a Dodge about now.

371
00:33:06,124 --> 00:33:09,355
We could really use a Dodge about now.

372
00:33:10,924 --> 00:33:12,357
What was that?

373
00:33:12,444 --> 00:33:14,241
You just sound so American.

374
00:33:14,324 --> 00:33:17,122
We could use a Dodge about now.

375
00:33:17,204 --> 00:33:20,321
While I'm makin' a doody,
can you hand me my sports section?

376
00:33:20,404 --> 00:33:22,315
Thank you very much, ma'am.

377
00:33:23,404 --> 00:33:25,474
Are you mocking me?

378
00:33:25,564 --> 00:33:27,919
No. Baby, just floor it.

379
00:33:28,004 --> 00:33:32,236
I am flooring it. If I pushed any harder,
my foot would blow through the floor,

380
00:33:32,324 --> 00:33:34,474
and we'd be Flintstoning there.

381
00:33:34,564 --> 00:33:36,634
Whoa, turn here!

382
00:33:44,684 --> 00:33:46,003
- You OK?
- Yeah. You?

383
00:33:50,124 --> 00:33:55,039
Ifyou'd told me about the turn before, I
wouldn't have had to pull such a manoeuvre!

384
00:33:55,124 --> 00:33:58,639
I was busy looking at the map!
Somebody had to navigate.

385
00:34:05,444 --> 00:34:09,403
Listen to us. We sound
like an old married couple.

386
00:34:11,604 --> 00:34:13,595
Never again.

387
00:34:20,084 --> 00:34:23,997
Just for the record, why did I
almost get us killed back there?

388
00:34:24,844 --> 00:34:26,880
Because that's our hotel.

389
00:34:28,084 --> 00:34:31,679
- It looks like a castle.
- It is a castle.

390
00:34:31,764 --> 00:34:34,597
Then that's precisely why it looks like one.

391
00:34:36,364 --> 00:34:38,036
Let's go.

392
00:34:56,924 --> 00:35:01,281
This is the most beautiful thing I've ever seen.

393
00:35:03,044 --> 00:35:05,035
Let's go.

394
00:35:18,204 --> 00:35:22,197
Look, baby, look. It comes with free nuns.

395
00:35:41,644 --> 00:35:43,600
- Vous êtes Américains?
- Oui.

396
00:35:43,684 --> 00:35:46,676
Welcome to Hôtel des Rêves.
I am Henri Margeaux.

397
00:35:46,764 --> 00:35:49,073
Nous sommes Sarah et Tom Leezak.

398
00:35:49,164 --> 00:35:50,483
- Leezak, no!
- Oui.

399
00:35:50,564 --> 00:35:52,361
- The honeymooners?
- Oui.

400
00:35:52,444 --> 00:35:55,083
- No!
- Oui. Why?

401
00:35:55,164 --> 00:35:58,759
So fresh and young to have marriage, no?

402
00:35:58,844 --> 00:36:00,835
No. We're married.

403
00:36:01,284 --> 00:36:03,844
I almost forget.

404
00:36:03,924 --> 00:36:06,438
Ooh, presents.

405
00:36:06,524 --> 00:36:09,834
"Congratulations.
Have a wonderful honeymoon. Love...

406
00:36:10,564 --> 00:36:12,395
Peter."

407
00:36:12,484 --> 00:36:14,952
That's a platonic "Iove".

408
00:36:16,524 --> 00:36:18,833
Forget about Peter.

409
00:36:18,924 --> 00:36:20,915
Here. Please enjoy.

410
00:36:22,044 --> 00:36:24,558
Room, all upstairs.

411
00:36:24,644 --> 00:36:27,602
François, les bagages, en haut.
Tout de suite, s'il vous plaît.

412
00:36:36,884 --> 00:36:39,114
Tell me this isn't your fantasy.

413
00:36:41,684 --> 00:36:43,402
This is better than my fantasy.

414
00:36:43,484 --> 00:36:45,873
Good, cos we're paying out the ass for it.

415
00:36:45,964 --> 00:36:49,036
Honey, just for the record,
when you talk about money,

416
00:36:49,124 --> 00:36:54,198
especially it coming out ofyour heinie,
it sort of kills the romance ofthe moment.

417
00:36:54,804 --> 00:36:56,522
Right. Sorry.

418
00:36:59,204 --> 00:37:04,153
Now fight your deep urge to be cheap,
and give the bellboy a large tip.

419
00:37:04,244 --> 00:37:05,359
All right.

420
00:37:05,444 --> 00:37:09,801
- Hey, do you guys provide satellite TV?
- TV in bar.

421
00:37:11,204 --> 00:37:14,833
- So there's no TV in this room?
- TV in bar.

422
00:37:17,924 --> 00:37:20,882
- Ask him ifthey have ESPN.
- Pourl'amour de Dieu.

423
00:37:20,964 --> 00:37:24,036
Je luiai dit, à monsieur,
que la télé est dans le bar.

424
00:37:24,364 --> 00:37:28,721
Je crois que sa femme n'estpas vous.
C'estla télé.

425
00:37:31,404 --> 00:37:33,998
He said the TV's in the bar.

426
00:37:37,964 --> 00:37:42,515
He also said that if he were here with me,
he wouldn't be concerned with TV.

427
00:37:44,484 --> 00:37:45,917
He makes a point.

428
00:37:46,004 --> 00:37:50,361
- I gotta call Mom and Dad.
- Talk about killing the romance.

429
00:37:50,444 --> 00:37:53,242
I told them I'd call. It'll just take a minute.

430
00:37:55,084 --> 00:37:57,393
Hi, Mom? It's Peewee.

431
00:37:57,484 --> 00:37:59,236
Say hi to Pussy for me.

432
00:38:03,004 --> 00:38:04,517
Tom says hello.

433
00:38:05,084 --> 00:38:07,552
Yeah. Oh, it's so great.

434
00:38:10,244 --> 00:38:15,318
"To Tom and Sarah.
Enhance thy honeymoon. Love, Kyle."

435
00:38:15,884 --> 00:38:17,875
I'll call you later, Mom. Bye.

436
00:38:19,204 --> 00:38:22,276
Cheese and rice.
Is that a Thunderstick A200?

437
00:38:22,364 --> 00:38:24,161
Since when did you become an expert?

438
00:38:24,244 --> 00:38:28,317
- I told you about that night I had in college.
- Not about the hardware.

439
00:38:28,404 --> 00:38:30,554
Getting a visual?

440
00:38:31,924 --> 00:38:34,279
We gotta charge this thing.

441
00:38:41,844 --> 00:38:46,122
- That plug won't fit in a European outlet.
- I'll make it fit.

442
00:38:49,164 --> 00:38:50,313
Come on.

443
00:38:50,404 --> 00:38:51,393
Don't force it.

444
00:39:03,324 --> 00:39:05,121
Are you OK? Are you OK?

445
00:39:05,204 --> 00:39:09,755
Holy dude Jesus. Good thing that
didn't happen when we were using it.

446
00:39:12,044 --> 00:39:13,113
Oh, God.

447
00:39:13,204 --> 00:39:16,480
Allez dans la cour,
s'il vous plaît, tout de suite.

448
00:39:16,564 --> 00:39:18,839
Come on! Come on, Thunderstick!

449
00:39:18,924 --> 00:39:22,394
- Oh, no. OK, just leave it.
- Let's go, let's go, let's go.

450
00:39:48,284 --> 00:39:52,800
My grandparents
installed the wiring in the hotel

451
00:39:52,884 --> 00:39:55,523
before World War First!

452
00:39:57,404 --> 00:40:03,161
It worked fine, until you young kids had
to bring out your toys and ignore the sign!

453
00:40:08,484 --> 00:40:10,998
That is the...

454
00:40:11,084 --> 00:40:14,963
- That's in French, for chrissakes.
- That's because we're in France.

455
00:40:15,044 --> 00:40:18,195
- Is there anything we could do?
- Pay the damages.

456
00:40:18,284 --> 00:40:19,603
Hold on there, Jacques.

457
00:40:19,684 --> 00:40:22,437
Je m'appelle Henri Margeaux.

458
00:40:22,524 --> 00:40:26,676
Whatever! Look, this hotel gets
guests from all over the world.

459
00:40:26,764 --> 00:40:29,642
It's your responsibility
to put American on your signs.

460
00:40:29,724 --> 00:40:30,998
He means English.

461
00:40:31,084 --> 00:40:33,598
I'm trying to negotiate.

462
00:40:33,684 --> 00:40:35,800
So I must make my hotel of dreams

463
00:40:35,884 --> 00:40:38,796
Iike every Howard Johnson's,
with a bright orange roof?

464
00:40:38,884 --> 00:40:42,081
- It wouldn't hurt.
- Imbécile de cochon d'Américain.

465
00:40:42,164 --> 00:40:45,236
- Cochon what?
- Stupid American pig.

466
00:40:49,124 --> 00:40:54,517
Well, I guess that makes you
a stupid French frog!

467
00:40:54,604 --> 00:40:56,560
Oh, yeah. I said it. Frog!

468
00:40:56,644 --> 00:40:58,794
Get out of my Hôtel des Rêves!

469
00:40:58,884 --> 00:41:02,160
I wouldn't stay in this dump ifyou paid us!

470
00:41:03,004 --> 00:41:05,757
- Let's go to the Ho Jo's.
- There are no Ho Jo's here.

471
00:41:05,844 --> 00:41:07,516
Sarah, please!

472
00:41:07,604 --> 00:41:11,722
There is a farm up the road.
And they have a nice pigsty for you!

473
00:41:11,804 --> 00:41:14,876
Yeah? Maybe they'll have
a nice little bulldozer,

474
00:41:14,964 --> 00:41:18,081
and we can finish this place off, tough guy!

475
00:41:18,164 --> 00:41:21,520
And the credit bill will be
a fat one, Mr Tough Guy!

476
00:41:21,604 --> 00:41:26,041
Yeah? Well, we're keeping the champagne
and the cheese, Jacques-strap!

477
00:41:27,684 --> 00:41:29,242
Let's go, honey.

478
00:41:30,964 --> 00:41:32,955
What's wrong?

479
00:41:33,964 --> 00:41:36,603
Where are we gonna stay, Tom?

480
00:41:36,684 --> 00:41:40,074
Don't worry. This is a vacation zone.
We'll find a place.

481
00:41:40,164 --> 00:41:42,041
Now get your shit. Let's go.

482
00:41:43,084 --> 00:41:44,915
What's the next place?

483
00:41:45,004 --> 00:41:50,795
The next hotel with no vacancy
would be Schloss Hilliger Winterswald.

484
00:41:50,884 --> 00:41:53,717
- How far is it?
- 120 kilometres.

485
00:41:53,804 --> 00:41:55,681
In miles, please!

486
00:41:55,764 --> 00:41:58,676
74.4. You multiply by 0.6.

487
00:41:58,764 --> 00:42:02,518
- I'm learning so much.
- Oh, me too. Me too.

488
00:42:09,164 --> 00:42:10,722
Let me guess...

489
00:42:17,204 --> 00:42:19,672
This is great. This is just what we need.

490
00:42:19,764 --> 00:42:23,439
- Do you want me to drive?
- Honey, I can drive in the snow.

491
00:42:26,084 --> 00:42:28,279
Turn offyour brights, jackass!

492
00:42:59,124 --> 00:43:03,117
Great. Now we get to freeze to death.

493
00:43:05,844 --> 00:43:11,123
Look, we'll just... We'll sleep in here
and we'll dig out in the morning.

494
00:43:11,204 --> 00:43:15,038
I'm so glad I get to hear the phrase
"We'll dig out" on my honeymoon.

495
00:43:20,164 --> 00:43:22,519
Just get it over with now and blame me.

496
00:43:22,604 --> 00:43:27,394
Ifyou hadn't insulted Henri, we wouldn't
be spending the evening in a snowball.

497
00:43:27,484 --> 00:43:32,842
I'm sorry. Next time, I'll try to be a little
bit more refined like your friend Peter.

498
00:43:32,924 --> 00:43:35,597
- Good night, Tom.
- Good night, Sarah.

499
00:44:10,164 --> 00:44:12,280
Are you gonna hate me for ever?

500
00:44:14,884 --> 00:44:17,079
I don't know.

501
00:44:20,884 --> 00:44:22,476
Wanna get drunk and make out?

502
00:44:22,564 --> 00:44:26,193
Well, that's not gonna get me drunk,
but we could make out.

503
00:44:31,324 --> 00:44:34,282
We could get injured doing this.

504
00:44:34,364 --> 00:44:37,834
I'll settle for a cuddle.
Just let me get the shifter out of my ass.

505
00:44:48,444 --> 00:44:51,402
Sarah... It's morning.

506
00:45:10,324 --> 00:45:12,440
Oh, my God.

507
00:45:15,924 --> 00:45:17,960
- Oh, my...
- Oh, my God.

508
00:45:18,044 --> 00:45:19,796
It's incredible.

509
00:45:20,204 --> 00:45:24,516
- Let's just stay here for the rest ofthe trip.
- Fine with me.

510
00:45:31,524 --> 00:45:33,560
- Hey! Help!
- Excuse me!

511
00:45:37,764 --> 00:45:40,232
Blue car, blue car!

512
00:45:41,284 --> 00:45:42,114
It worked.

513
00:46:13,004 --> 00:46:16,679
We can catch the two o'clock train to Venice
and go straight to the Gianna.

514
00:46:16,764 --> 00:46:20,643
- Our reservation isn't until Tuesday.
- So we'll stay a few extra days.

515
00:46:20,724 --> 00:46:22,999
I just put a castle on my credit card.

516
00:46:23,084 --> 00:46:26,235
We can't afford to stay at the Gianna
for a few extra days.

517
00:46:26,324 --> 00:46:29,202
So I'll call my dad up,
and he'll lend us the money.

518
00:46:29,284 --> 00:46:32,435
No, there's no way
I'm taking money from your dad.

519
00:46:32,524 --> 00:46:34,799
Pride is the crutch ofthe insecure.

520
00:46:34,884 --> 00:46:37,603
You are not taking the money.
I am taking the money.

521
00:46:37,684 --> 00:46:41,723
No, we don't need to take the money.
This is about us now.

522
00:46:41,804 --> 00:46:45,433
My dad told me about this
nice little pensione in Venice...

523
00:46:45,524 --> 00:46:46,718
Pensione?

524
00:46:46,804 --> 00:46:49,796
- GroBes ScheiBhaus.
- Excuse me.

525
00:46:49,884 --> 00:46:51,761
Could you just drive?

526
00:46:51,844 --> 00:46:53,436
Please just let me call my dad.

527
00:46:53,524 --> 00:46:56,641
No! This is our honeymoon, not his.

528
00:46:56,724 --> 00:47:00,273
So it's fine to stay at a pensione
that yourfather recommended?

529
00:47:00,364 --> 00:47:04,152
We're staying at the Pensione Funicello,
and we'll have a good time.

530
00:47:04,244 --> 00:47:08,283
I can't take this any more! Honeymoons
are supposed to be all champagne

531
00:47:08,364 --> 00:47:11,993
and room service and lovemaking!
We haven't made love!

532
00:47:12,084 --> 00:47:15,042
No. What do we get?
We get evicted from a five-star hotel

533
00:47:15,124 --> 00:47:18,833
and, to boot, I'm yelling at you!
We're yelling at each other.

534
00:47:18,924 --> 00:47:23,475
We're not yelling at each other. I'm
the one yelling. I'm sorry, I wanna go home.

535
00:47:23,564 --> 00:47:25,361
Maybe we should go home.

536
00:47:25,444 --> 00:47:28,720
I know this honeymoon hasn't been perfect,

537
00:47:28,804 --> 00:47:33,320
but I'm sure the pensione is gonna be fine.
Look, we'll check in, sleep late,

538
00:47:33,404 --> 00:47:37,033
eat pasta, gaze out at the Piazza del...

539
00:47:38,244 --> 00:47:40,235
something-something.

540
00:47:41,124 --> 00:47:42,477
It's gonna be heaven.

541
00:47:52,684 --> 00:47:54,959
Pensione Funicello?

542
00:47:59,204 --> 00:48:01,434
Are you sure?

543
00:48:03,644 --> 00:48:05,362
How bad could it be?

544
00:48:09,044 --> 00:48:10,841
Aw, crap.

545
00:48:18,044 --> 00:48:20,194
We're in this together, right?

546
00:48:22,284 --> 00:48:25,833
Do you have four men staring
at your boobies right now?

547
00:48:31,324 --> 00:48:32,677
No.

548
00:49:07,804 --> 00:49:09,556
Yeah, just...

549
00:49:09,644 --> 00:49:13,159
You know, we'll try it for one night,
and ifwe don't...

550
00:49:13,244 --> 00:49:15,394
Live.

551
00:49:15,484 --> 00:49:20,842
..like it, we'll, you know,
go somewhere nicer tomorrow.

552
00:49:30,084 --> 00:49:32,678
This is actually happening!

553
00:49:37,244 --> 00:49:40,122
We're never gonna forget this honeymoon.

554
00:50:10,444 --> 00:50:12,082
Sorry.

555
00:50:36,204 --> 00:50:38,672
We can show those paisanos how it's done.

556
00:50:43,284 --> 00:50:45,878
Cockroach, cockroach, cockroach!

557
00:50:45,964 --> 00:50:48,353
Oh, honey! Honey, honey! I'll get him!

558
00:50:50,564 --> 00:50:53,476
Let's get outta here, please!

559
00:50:53,564 --> 00:50:55,953
- We're checking out!
- I don't wanna touch it!

560
00:50:56,044 --> 00:50:57,841
Get it off me!

561
00:51:01,964 --> 00:51:04,114
Thanks for the help, Daddy.

562
00:51:05,204 --> 00:51:08,082
I miss you.

563
00:51:10,124 --> 00:51:11,921
Honey, he wants to talk to you.

564
00:51:12,004 --> 00:51:16,361
Can't you just tell him thank you from
all of us here at the gorgeous Gianna?

565
00:51:25,204 --> 00:51:27,115
Hello there, Mr McNerney.

566
00:51:27,204 --> 00:51:30,958
Please bear in mind that
our daughter loves him, Dan.

567
00:51:31,044 --> 00:51:36,994
Listen, Leezak, I don't expect
a cracker like you to ever measure up

568
00:51:37,084 --> 00:51:40,759
to anything approaching what I'd consider
a good match for my daughter.

569
00:51:40,844 --> 00:51:42,596
But I'll tell you what I do expect.

570
00:51:42,684 --> 00:51:47,121
I expect you to pay me back in full just as
soon as that silly-ass radio show ofyours

571
00:51:47,204 --> 00:51:49,320
yields any kind of reasonable income.

572
00:51:49,404 --> 00:51:51,599
Goodbye, cracker.

573
00:51:53,444 --> 00:51:55,594
Ass-bag!

574
00:51:55,684 --> 00:51:58,244
- What was that?
- He called me a cracker!

575
00:51:58,324 --> 00:52:00,474
A cracker, honey!

576
00:52:00,564 --> 00:52:02,555
He did not.

577
00:52:02,644 --> 00:52:06,762
That surprises you? Your dad hates me.
"Well, wonderful, wonderful."

578
00:52:06,844 --> 00:52:10,359
He's got your whole family
praying that this marriage fails.

579
00:52:10,444 --> 00:52:12,912
Mom's never said a bad word about you.

580
00:52:13,004 --> 00:52:17,316
Wow, Pussy's never insulted me!
Now I feel loved.

581
00:52:17,404 --> 00:52:19,793
Like your father's neverjudged me?

582
00:52:19,884 --> 00:52:22,876
No, he hasn't. Not once.

583
00:52:29,164 --> 00:52:30,882
Maybe we should just have sex.

584
00:52:30,964 --> 00:52:34,513
Call me crazy, but I'm just
not in the mood to make love.

585
00:52:36,724 --> 00:52:41,320
I'm not, either. But we haven't had sex once
since we've been married,

586
00:52:41,404 --> 00:52:44,476
and there is something
very, very wrong with that.

587
00:52:44,564 --> 00:52:47,476
And I have to tell you... It's not funny!

588
00:52:47,564 --> 00:52:49,794
I'm sorry.

589
00:52:49,884 --> 00:52:52,114
I'm concerned.

590
00:52:52,204 --> 00:52:57,961
Let's go to sleep. We'll get a good rest,
we'll sightsee tomorrow.

591
00:52:58,044 --> 00:53:00,035
Be fresh in the morning.

592
00:53:01,684 --> 00:53:03,242
Fine.

593
00:53:04,804 --> 00:53:07,079
And then we'll have sex.

594
00:53:57,724 --> 00:54:01,842
Imagine Ernest Hemingway sitting
right over there at the Caffè Florian,

595
00:54:01,924 --> 00:54:06,475
just sipping a single malt,
dreaming up his next masterpiece.

596
00:54:09,964 --> 00:54:12,080
Those birds are psychotic.

597
00:54:13,484 --> 00:54:16,203
History doesn't interest you at all, does it?

598
00:54:16,284 --> 00:54:21,312
Huh? Yeah, it does. I wasn't an art history
major, though, so it's not like...

599
00:54:21,404 --> 00:54:24,840
You don't have to be an art history major
to appreciate art.

600
00:54:24,924 --> 00:54:27,643
- Whoa, whoa.
- What? What?

601
00:54:27,724 --> 00:54:29,794
Do you hear that?

602
00:54:29,884 --> 00:54:33,479
The bells? No? What is it, honey?

603
00:54:33,564 --> 00:54:35,555
What?

604
00:54:36,324 --> 00:54:38,042
What?

605
00:54:38,124 --> 00:54:39,273
What?

606
00:54:39,364 --> 00:54:42,436
What are we listening to?

607
00:54:43,764 --> 00:54:46,153
What? What is it? I can help.

608
00:54:46,244 --> 00:54:49,361
- It's a message from God. It's a mes...
- God?

609
00:54:50,924 --> 00:54:53,392
There's a ground ball...

610
00:54:53,484 --> 00:54:55,281
Jackpot!

611
00:54:57,124 --> 00:54:59,718
Honey, we still have to see the Tintorettos.

612
00:55:01,644 --> 00:55:06,672
Oh, the church art is unbelievable,

613
00:55:06,764 --> 00:55:09,232
but it all kinda looks the same to me.

614
00:55:10,804 --> 00:55:13,477
You know I love sports.

615
00:55:13,564 --> 00:55:17,034
I mean, I'm a sports freak.
But how often are we in Europe?

616
00:55:17,124 --> 00:55:19,957
How often are the Dodgers on TV in Europe?

617
00:55:22,804 --> 00:55:27,195
You're right. You go watch sports.
I'll go see the Tintorettos.

618
00:55:37,124 --> 00:55:38,637
- Honey...
- Yeah?

619
00:55:38,724 --> 00:55:43,718
Is this a loving act of generosity,
or am I gonna pay for this later?

620
00:55:44,524 --> 00:55:47,118
Does it make a difference?

621
00:55:47,204 --> 00:55:50,276
I'm gonna make this up to you huge. Huge.

622
00:55:50,364 --> 00:55:54,152
Tonight, everything is your choice.
Dinner in a church, ifyou want.

623
00:55:59,124 --> 00:56:00,842
- Meet you at the hotel.
- Love you!

624
00:56:00,924 --> 00:56:03,119
I love you.

625
00:56:46,084 --> 00:56:48,040
Peter?

626
00:56:48,124 --> 00:56:51,355
- Peewee? What a surprise!
- What are you doing here?

627
00:56:51,444 --> 00:56:52,763
- In Venice?
- Yes.

628
00:56:52,844 --> 00:56:58,840
Nextron's buying out Ferrugia Chocolate,
so they sent me in to close the deal.

629
00:56:58,924 --> 00:57:03,315
- Did you get that cognac I sent you?
- Yes. I thought it a tad inappropriate.

630
00:57:04,244 --> 00:57:06,553
I'm sor... I didn't...

631
00:57:06,644 --> 00:57:09,238
I'm just trying to be the gallant loser here.

632
00:57:09,324 --> 00:57:11,394
- Peter...
- Why don't we celebrate?

633
00:57:11,484 --> 00:57:13,600
I'll take you guys to dinner.

634
00:57:13,684 --> 00:57:15,993
I'm on my honeymoon.

635
00:57:16,084 --> 00:57:18,439
- My honeymoon.
- Right, right, right.

636
00:57:18,524 --> 00:57:20,640
See? Yeah.

637
00:57:20,724 --> 00:57:23,079
I can be so thick sometimes. I'm sorry.

638
00:57:23,164 --> 00:57:26,440
I got a lot ofwork to do anyway,
so I'm going to disappear.

639
00:57:26,524 --> 00:57:27,957
But you guys have fun.

640
00:57:28,044 --> 00:57:29,602
Peter, wait.

641
00:57:29,684 --> 00:57:31,117
I'm...

642
00:57:31,204 --> 00:57:33,559
I don't mean to be rude.

643
00:57:34,564 --> 00:57:36,555
You couldn't be rude ifyou tried.

644
00:57:37,284 --> 00:57:40,242
How's the honeymoon?
It's good? It's a dream?

645
00:57:40,324 --> 00:57:41,677
- It's great.
- Yeah?

646
00:57:41,764 --> 00:57:44,358
- Oh, yeah, great.
- Where's Tom?

647
00:57:44,444 --> 00:57:47,754
Oh, he's at the church with...

648
00:57:49,924 --> 00:57:54,076
He's a huge history buff. Yeah.

649
00:57:55,684 --> 00:58:00,553
- It's good you guys share that passion.
- Oh, yeah. Yeah.

650
00:58:12,604 --> 00:58:16,961
Fredo, I need to know where
that little signora is at all times.

651
00:58:17,684 --> 00:58:20,437
Very bold, Mr Prentiss.

652
00:58:26,324 --> 00:58:28,963
The Dodgers won! The Dodgers won!

653
00:58:29,044 --> 00:58:31,035
The Dodgers won, honey.

654
00:58:32,124 --> 00:58:36,959
See? I knew you were gonna make me pay
for watching the game.

655
00:58:37,044 --> 00:58:40,354
No. No, it's not that.

656
00:58:41,604 --> 00:58:43,196
We need to talk.

657
00:58:45,684 --> 00:58:47,834
About what?

658
00:58:47,924 --> 00:58:49,915
Have you always told me the truth?

659
00:58:50,004 --> 00:58:53,360
Yeah. Except the time I told you
I liked your brother Willie.

660
00:58:53,444 --> 00:58:56,083
- This is serious.
- I am serious. I don't like him.

661
00:58:56,164 --> 00:58:59,236
- Marriage is built on honesty and trust.
- I agree.

662
00:58:59,324 --> 00:59:02,760
Did you ever do something
that you wanted to tell me about,

663
00:59:02,844 --> 00:59:05,517
but you couldn't
because you felt bad about it?

664
00:59:05,604 --> 00:59:08,357
And the more time went on,
the harder it was to tell me,

665
00:59:08,444 --> 00:59:12,562
and it turned into this big fat lie,
so you kept not telling me about it...

666
00:59:12,644 --> 00:59:15,078
Did you talk to Kyle?

667
00:59:15,164 --> 00:59:17,473
- No. Why?
- No reason.

668
00:59:17,564 --> 00:59:20,203
- Does he know something I should know?
- No.

669
00:59:20,284 --> 00:59:22,240
- You covered your nose.
- I had an itch.

670
00:59:22,324 --> 00:59:25,634
You were hiding flared nostrils.
What do you have to tell?

671
00:59:29,764 --> 00:59:32,119
It's just

672
00:59:32,204 --> 00:59:34,513
when Bags died,

673
00:59:34,604 --> 00:59:39,314
he didn't exactly die
the way that I described it.

674
00:59:39,404 --> 00:59:44,080
Him chasing the squawking pigeons
offthe balcony?

675
00:59:44,164 --> 00:59:45,961
That.

676
00:59:46,044 --> 00:59:47,841
What happened?

677
00:59:47,924 --> 00:59:51,678
Well... OK, I'm reading my magazine,

678
00:59:51,764 --> 00:59:54,198
and I'm focusing, and I'm really into it.

679
00:59:54,284 --> 00:59:57,435
And along comes Bags.
He comes trucking over,

680
00:59:57,524 --> 01:00:01,836
and he starts tugging on my ankle.

681
01:00:01,924 --> 01:00:04,802
And I was, like, "Bags, I'm..." I was like...

682
01:00:05,124 --> 01:00:08,355
I think I even said "I'm trying to focus."

683
01:00:08,444 --> 01:00:13,916
And he looked up at me and gave me the
"Hey, are you gonna play with me or not?"

684
01:00:14,004 --> 01:00:17,679
I was, like, "Yeah, I reallyjust
wanna read, though, Bags."

685
01:00:17,764 --> 01:00:20,881
And he started pulling at my ankle again,

686
01:00:20,964 --> 01:00:24,673
and so I grabbed the ball
and I was, like, "Go get it, buddy."

687
01:00:24,764 --> 01:00:29,792
I threw the ball over my shoulder, it went
out the window, Bags dove, and he died.

688
01:00:30,844 --> 01:00:32,482
You killed Bags?

689
01:00:32,564 --> 01:00:35,920
- It was an accident.
- And you lied about it all this time?

690
01:00:36,804 --> 01:00:40,558
- Actually, it was more of an omission.
- No, it was more like a lie!

691
01:00:41,084 --> 01:00:42,597
Where are you going?

692
01:00:42,684 --> 01:00:46,359
- I have to figure out what to do with this.
- What does that mean?

693
01:00:46,444 --> 01:00:49,083
I can deal with you
being cheap and a shitty driver.

694
01:00:49,164 --> 01:00:52,042
I cannot deal with you being a liar!

695
01:00:53,044 --> 01:00:55,763
Wait a second.

696
01:00:55,844 --> 01:00:58,995
This started with you
wanting to talk about something.

697
01:00:59,084 --> 01:01:01,598
Well, I don't wanna talk about it right now.

698
01:01:02,564 --> 01:01:04,759
So you feel guilty about something, too.

699
01:01:04,844 --> 01:01:09,201
Yes, there is something I "omitted"
that I don't wanna talk about right now.

700
01:01:09,284 --> 01:01:12,117
You want a marriage
based on trust and honesty?

701
01:01:12,204 --> 01:01:14,434
Well, here's your chance! Come on!

702
01:01:14,524 --> 01:01:17,516
Yeah, yeah, you got it! I can see it! Bring it!

703
01:01:17,604 --> 01:01:19,993
I slept with Peter Prentiss.

704
01:01:25,164 --> 01:01:26,153
What?

705
01:01:26,244 --> 01:01:29,520
- I slept with Peter...
- I heard you.

706
01:01:29,604 --> 01:01:31,754
- I'm sorry.
- I need to hear everything.

707
01:01:31,844 --> 01:01:34,074
- No, you don't.
- Yes, I do. That's what I do.

708
01:01:34,164 --> 01:01:36,200
I need to know everything.

709
01:01:36,284 --> 01:01:40,072
Where you were, what he did,
how small his wiener was. Everything.

710
01:01:40,164 --> 01:01:43,998
- I was helping on an appraisal in Seattle...
- I don't wanna hear it!

711
01:01:46,724 --> 01:01:49,397
- You slept with that...
- It was a long time ago.

712
01:01:49,484 --> 01:01:50,758
- When?
- Before we...

713
01:01:50,844 --> 01:01:51,913
- Got married?
- Yes!

714
01:01:52,004 --> 01:01:52,993
- Engaged?
- Of course.

715
01:01:53,084 --> 01:01:56,679
- Got together?
- Yes... No, no.

716
01:01:56,764 --> 01:02:00,040
It was right after we met.
My parents were pressuring me to...

717
01:02:00,124 --> 01:02:03,560
Aha. Imagine my surprise.

718
01:02:05,804 --> 01:02:08,762
I was confused. I'm in Seattle.

719
01:02:08,844 --> 01:02:11,916
He asked me out to dinner.
The champagne is flowing...

720
01:02:12,004 --> 01:02:14,234
Please, try not to break into song.

721
01:02:14,644 --> 01:02:19,593
My feelings for you were very, very strong,

722
01:02:19,684 --> 01:02:21,993
and I needed to know that they were real.

723
01:02:22,084 --> 01:02:25,838
I wasn't brought up to manage
feelings like that very well.

724
01:02:25,924 --> 01:02:30,042
Yeah. You had a real tough upbringing.

725
01:02:33,204 --> 01:02:36,162
- I need some air.
- Yeah? Me too.

726
01:02:36,244 --> 01:02:38,917
Happy now? You broke it.

727
01:02:39,004 --> 01:02:41,199
By the way, Peter's staying at the hotel.

728
01:02:41,284 --> 01:02:43,320
That's funny!

729
01:02:48,884 --> 01:02:50,602
- Hooker!
- Murderer!

730
01:03:11,404 --> 01:03:14,441
- What's the score?
- 3-2, top ofthe ninth.

731
01:03:17,484 --> 01:03:20,203
Are you American?

732
01:03:20,284 --> 01:03:21,512
Good guess.

733
01:03:56,204 --> 01:03:58,115
Where's Tom?

734
01:03:58,204 --> 01:04:01,480
We don't feel the need to be
with each other all the time.

735
01:04:07,044 --> 01:04:11,356
I just find it odd that
you're spending so much time apart

736
01:04:11,444 --> 01:04:13,435
on your honeymoon.

737
01:04:16,484 --> 01:04:18,520
Are you OK?

738
01:04:18,604 --> 01:04:22,119
Peter, just go, please.

739
01:04:23,444 --> 01:04:25,162
Go.

740
01:04:45,804 --> 01:04:49,240
- Why are you still here?
- I won't leave you here like this.

741
01:04:51,804 --> 01:04:55,638
Listen, I have a car. I'm having
a quick drink at a friend's house.

742
01:04:55,724 --> 01:04:58,955
Just take a ride with me.
You know? Catch your breath.

743
01:04:59,044 --> 01:05:01,035
I'll take you back to Tom.

744
01:05:07,844 --> 01:05:10,312
- Champagne?
- Sure.

745
01:05:21,364 --> 01:05:23,719
And that's the ball game!

746
01:05:25,804 --> 01:05:28,477
Oh, my God. Oh, my God, I love this song!

747
01:05:28,564 --> 01:05:32,443
No, wait, I really shouldn't...
I can't... No, listen.

748
01:05:33,564 --> 01:05:37,352
Bernardo Salviati can actually
trace his family back to Machiavelli.

749
01:05:48,724 --> 01:05:52,000
Wow. That's a big house.

750
01:05:52,084 --> 01:05:55,759
Nextron's thinking of buying it,
turn it into a resort complex.

751
01:06:09,484 --> 01:06:11,202
Peter, hello.

752
01:06:11,284 --> 01:06:14,754
Good to see you.
Bernardo, Sarah McNerney.

753
01:06:18,124 --> 01:06:21,355
Tell me, pretty one,
what brings you to Venice?

754
01:06:21,444 --> 01:06:23,400
I'm on my honeymoon.

755
01:06:23,484 --> 01:06:24,883
- Your honeymoon?
- Yeah.

756
01:06:24,964 --> 01:06:28,877
- She's so young to be married.
- Why does everyone keep on saying that?

757
01:06:29,484 --> 01:06:30,883
Where is your husband?

758
01:06:30,964 --> 01:06:36,322
I'm going to meet up with him,
you know, later.

759
01:06:38,964 --> 01:06:43,799
I was married for 27 years
before my wife passed away.

760
01:06:43,884 --> 01:06:48,196
Believe me, the first months
are the most difficult.

761
01:06:52,604 --> 01:06:55,198
Bernardo here's a little bit of a romantic.

762
01:06:57,564 --> 01:06:59,555
I love that.

763
01:07:00,284 --> 01:07:01,922
Let's have a drink.

764
01:07:02,644 --> 01:07:03,872
Please.

765
01:07:03,964 --> 01:07:07,559
You're on the radio? That's awesome!

766
01:07:09,084 --> 01:07:14,875
So, when are we gonna go back to do the...?

767
01:07:15,284 --> 01:07:18,321
Whoa, yeah. I can't do that.

768
01:07:18,404 --> 01:07:23,273
Don't tell me all the cute conversation
and air-humping is leading nowhere.

769
01:07:27,044 --> 01:07:31,993
You mean when are we gonna...?

770
01:07:34,444 --> 01:07:40,280
All right, so I'm gonna go and hit the...
and then we'll do that thing.

771
01:07:40,364 --> 01:07:42,832
- Cool.
- OK.

772
01:07:42,924 --> 01:07:44,915
I'll be waiting!

773
01:08:03,244 --> 01:08:05,883
And the hits just keep on comin'.

774
01:08:17,364 --> 01:08:20,037
Can I get the key to 309, please?

775
01:08:20,124 --> 01:08:23,002
And do you know
if my wife's up in the room?

776
01:08:23,084 --> 01:08:26,121
A good husband knows
where his wife is at all time.

777
01:08:27,564 --> 01:08:31,557
And a good maitre d'
answers questions when he's asked.

778
01:08:37,524 --> 01:08:39,833
Look, I'm not gonna pay you for an answer.

779
01:08:40,844 --> 01:08:43,153
In this case, you should.

780
01:08:52,844 --> 01:08:57,156
Your wife is in a car on her way
to Salviati's, with Mr Prentiss.

781
01:08:57,844 --> 01:08:59,835
Mr Peter Prentiss?

782
01:09:02,724 --> 01:09:05,602
Of course. What's Salviati's?

783
01:09:05,684 --> 01:09:08,915
One ofthe oldest
and most beautiful estates in Venice.

784
01:09:09,004 --> 01:09:13,077
- Maybe Mr Peter will buy it.
- Of course Mr Peter will buy it.

785
01:09:13,164 --> 01:09:15,724
All right, where is this place?

786
01:09:20,284 --> 01:09:23,082
You can't go. You will be shot on sight.

787
01:09:23,164 --> 01:09:25,314
OK. That's...

788
01:09:28,204 --> 01:09:32,595
- When are they coming back?
- They are out for the evening.

789
01:09:32,684 --> 01:09:34,561
You know what?

790
01:09:34,644 --> 01:09:39,672
I'm not gonna be waiting here
for her when she gets back.

791
01:09:39,764 --> 01:09:41,482
Oh, no!

792
01:09:50,164 --> 01:09:52,598
I wanna say that word!

793
01:09:57,164 --> 01:10:00,918
Sarah,
maybe we should switch to water, huh?

794
01:10:05,004 --> 01:10:07,234
I think we should go find Tom now.

795
01:10:13,404 --> 01:10:16,316
That was the longest freakin' piss
in ltalian history.

796
01:10:16,404 --> 01:10:18,156
Hey, Wendy.

797
01:10:19,364 --> 01:10:22,162
I couldn't find you in the crowd.

798
01:10:24,084 --> 01:10:26,473
That's cool. You ready to go?

799
01:10:28,044 --> 01:10:30,558
Yeah. Listen...

800
01:10:30,644 --> 01:10:34,842
Why don't I just walk you back
to your hotel and drop you off?

801
01:10:34,924 --> 01:10:36,915
That sounds like a plan.

802
01:10:37,004 --> 01:10:39,564
OK. What hotel are you staying at?

803
01:10:39,644 --> 01:10:41,635
What hotel are you staying at?

804
01:10:42,764 --> 01:10:44,755
The Gianna.

805
01:10:44,844 --> 01:10:47,039
Oh, my God! Me too!

806
01:11:05,044 --> 01:11:08,673
Oh, my God. This is like a TwilightZone.

807
01:11:08,764 --> 01:11:10,755
I couldn't agree with you more.

808
01:11:22,964 --> 01:11:25,239
We're here.

809
01:11:27,044 --> 01:11:30,559
Damn, I don't have my key.
Can I use your phone?

810
01:11:30,644 --> 01:11:32,282
My phone?

811
01:11:32,364 --> 01:11:35,083
Yeah, to call downstairs. For my key.

812
01:11:45,044 --> 01:11:48,673
Oh, slow down there.
I think you got the wrong room.

813
01:11:52,964 --> 01:11:54,477
Oh, my!

814
01:11:56,324 --> 01:11:57,313
Oh, God.

815
01:11:57,404 --> 01:12:00,157
Insult me, radio man!

816
01:12:01,924 --> 01:12:04,154
I'm on my honeymoon.

817
01:12:10,324 --> 01:12:12,315
- I'm telling you...
- You pig!

818
01:12:32,684 --> 01:12:34,402
Thank you.

819
01:12:41,284 --> 01:12:43,479
What? What?

820
01:12:43,564 --> 01:12:45,361
- What?
- I can't take this any more.

821
01:12:49,004 --> 01:12:50,995
I'm on my honeymoon!

822
01:12:54,604 --> 01:12:57,960
Calm down. You were just doing
the same thing with Wendy.

823
01:12:58,044 --> 01:13:00,239
You have no right to be angry.

824
01:13:00,324 --> 01:13:02,792
- You slut!
- Excuse me?

825
01:13:02,884 --> 01:13:06,240
You had your tongue down his throat.
I saw it out the window!

826
01:13:06,924 --> 01:13:08,596
Did you see me slap him, then?

827
01:13:08,684 --> 01:13:10,720
Don't give me that.

828
01:13:10,804 --> 01:13:14,035
Some part ofyou wants him! Just say it!

829
01:13:14,124 --> 01:13:18,436
Fine. I'm not gonna lie any more.

830
01:13:18,524 --> 01:13:21,516
Certain things would be easier,
given his background.

831
01:13:21,604 --> 01:13:25,882
And a small part of me thought that
I wanted that once. A very small part.

832
01:13:29,764 --> 01:13:33,200
Why would you invite him
on our honeymoon?

833
01:13:33,284 --> 01:13:36,993
I didn't invite him.
I don't know how he found us.

834
01:13:37,084 --> 01:13:39,598
Oh, yeah? Well, maybe it was magic.

835
01:13:39,684 --> 01:13:42,756
No, Peter must be a warlock.

836
01:13:47,324 --> 01:13:48,723
That's yours.

837
01:13:48,804 --> 01:13:52,843
Yeah, sure. It matches perfect
with my red leather panties!

838
01:13:54,644 --> 01:13:58,796
OK, I met a woman at a bar.
Nothing happened.

839
01:13:58,884 --> 01:14:03,116
You picked up a total stranger at a bar,
brought her back to our honeymoon suite,

840
01:14:03,204 --> 01:14:05,195
and took off her disgusting red bra?

841
01:14:05,284 --> 01:14:06,876
Nothing happened, I swear.

842
01:14:06,964 --> 01:14:10,479
No, the brajustjumped off
her bare naked breasts.

843
01:14:11,884 --> 01:14:16,912
You sit there and make me feel guilty
for a kiss, a kiss that I didn't even want!

844
01:14:17,004 --> 01:14:19,598
Don't tell me you didn't want it!

845
01:14:20,404 --> 01:14:24,522
You wanted it! I could see from
the balcony that you wanted it!

846
01:14:26,724 --> 01:14:28,874
I'm sorry. Oh, my God.

847
01:14:28,964 --> 01:14:31,000
Son of a biatch!

848
01:14:31,084 --> 01:14:33,678
- My skull is on fire!
- Oh, oh, oh, OK...

849
01:14:34,964 --> 01:14:37,034
- Who is it?
- Room service.

850
01:14:37,444 --> 01:14:39,639
Just... You just...

851
01:14:43,324 --> 01:14:45,315
- No, go away!
- Listen, I'm leaving.

852
01:14:45,404 --> 01:14:47,918
Last chance. Come with me to Seattle.

853
01:14:48,004 --> 01:14:51,280
Hello, Peter. So glad you could join us.

854
01:14:52,404 --> 01:14:55,396
Welcome to the honeymoon from hell,
shitheel!

855
01:14:55,484 --> 01:14:56,758
What are you doing, Tom?

856
01:14:56,844 --> 01:15:00,359
I think it's time for Peter and I to tangle.

857
01:15:00,444 --> 01:15:03,720
- See? You have no future with this lunatic!
- Shut up!

858
01:15:03,804 --> 01:15:05,396
Tom, you're acting crazy!

859
01:15:05,484 --> 01:15:10,194
Maybe it's cos I just got hit in the head
with a ten-pound ashtray!

860
01:15:10,724 --> 01:15:15,400
I gotta warn you, Leezak. I studied
karate with a Chinese grandmaster.

861
01:15:15,484 --> 01:15:19,955
Yeah? Well, I hope he showed you
how to pull a fire poker out ofyour ass!

862
01:15:20,044 --> 01:15:22,035
Tom, put the poker down.

863
01:15:25,764 --> 01:15:28,517
Fredo, call the police!

864
01:15:29,684 --> 01:15:31,800
Move, move, move!

865
01:15:37,604 --> 01:15:40,357
You sat at our wedding!

866
01:15:40,444 --> 01:15:43,083
You heard us take our vows.

867
01:15:43,164 --> 01:15:48,284
And you still had the nerve
to show up on our honeymoon

868
01:15:48,364 --> 01:15:50,924
and try to have sex with my wife!

869
01:15:56,804 --> 01:15:57,998
Run, you coward!

870
01:15:58,084 --> 01:16:00,075
You stay away from my wife!

871
01:16:02,604 --> 01:16:04,083
I didn't...

872
01:16:04,164 --> 01:16:06,394
Please, stop! That's my husband!

873
01:16:17,084 --> 01:16:19,393
- Maybe they were right.
- Who?

874
01:16:21,844 --> 01:16:26,235
Everyone. They said that
we were too young,

875
01:16:27,004 --> 01:16:30,201
and that we needed to get
to know each other better.

876
01:16:32,604 --> 01:16:34,674
Maybe they were right.

877
01:16:35,844 --> 01:16:37,562
Maybe love isn't enough.

878
01:16:44,404 --> 01:16:45,473
What did he say?

879
01:16:45,564 --> 01:16:47,714
Peterjust bailed us out.

880
01:16:49,604 --> 01:16:51,879
Well, that's justjim-dandy.

881
01:16:53,444 --> 01:16:55,321
Forget it.

882
01:16:55,404 --> 01:16:57,474
- I'm going home.
- Yeah, me too!

883
01:17:00,844 --> 01:17:03,119
Passports, please.

884
01:17:03,204 --> 01:17:07,516
Are you leaving with any fruit,
vegetables or currency in excess of $10,000?

885
01:17:07,604 --> 01:17:12,553
No. No, but my husband does have
two pounds of hash hidden in his rectum.

886
01:17:23,684 --> 01:17:29,475
The first sex I had on my honeymoon
was with a man named Santino.

887
01:17:30,644 --> 01:17:32,475
And you're laughing?

888
01:17:33,964 --> 01:17:37,001
Excuse me, stewardess. Can l...?

889
01:17:39,764 --> 01:17:44,918
Can I get one ofthose doughnut pillows?

890
01:17:45,524 --> 01:17:47,515
Yeah, right away.

891
01:17:50,044 --> 01:17:52,478
Sweet girl.

892
01:17:55,084 --> 01:17:57,234
Excuse me. Sorry.

893
01:18:12,324 --> 01:18:14,918
I feel like we've been married for 50 years.

894
01:18:15,004 --> 01:18:17,040
Oh, you should be so lucky.

895
01:18:19,924 --> 01:18:24,679
- Tell me how Peter ended up in our hotel.
- Tell me what happened with Red Bra.

896
01:18:25,564 --> 01:18:28,203
What? What? What are you looking at?

897
01:18:28,284 --> 01:18:32,118
- I hope you used a rubber.
- No, I didn't! It didn't get that far.

898
01:18:32,204 --> 01:18:34,843
- I hope Peter used one.
- They don't sell condoms that big.

899
01:18:37,284 --> 01:18:40,515
That's funny. You hear that?
We got a comedian on the plane.

900
01:18:40,604 --> 01:18:42,993
- You want me to make you laugh?
- Yeah.

901
01:18:43,084 --> 01:18:45,644
I'm moving out when I get home.
How funny is that?

902
01:18:45,724 --> 01:18:48,079
- Great!
- The second we get home.

903
01:18:48,164 --> 01:18:49,916
- I'm done talking now.
- Me too.

904
01:18:52,484 --> 01:18:55,157
And that was it. Game over.

905
01:19:07,084 --> 01:19:09,359
- What's up?
- She came to the apartment.

906
01:19:09,444 --> 01:19:11,400
- Is she there now?
- No, she left.

907
01:19:12,084 --> 01:19:14,757
- Did she say anything?
- She took all her stuff.

908
01:19:15,524 --> 01:19:17,515
That can't be good.

909
01:19:18,764 --> 01:19:20,959
And she left you this.

910
01:19:21,324 --> 01:19:22,837
What's that?

911
01:19:27,444 --> 01:19:28,843
Beer?

912
01:19:29,524 --> 01:19:35,440
Come on, man. You're getting divorced.
Breakfast beer is a must.

913
01:19:37,404 --> 01:19:40,396
- I need to talk to my dad. Give me a lift?
- Sure.

914
01:19:44,244 --> 01:19:47,236
Gonna tell me what you're chewing on?

915
01:19:49,284 --> 01:19:51,673
I just don't know if love is enough any more.

916
01:19:51,764 --> 01:19:54,517
What do you mean, "enough"?

917
01:19:54,604 --> 01:19:59,280
I mean, even if Sarah and I do love each other,

918
01:20:00,484 --> 01:20:03,681
maybe we did need more time
to get to know each other.

919
01:20:06,924 --> 01:20:11,873
So, what you're saying here is

920
01:20:11,964 --> 01:20:16,515
you had a couple of bad days in Europe,
and it's over.

921
01:20:18,604 --> 01:20:20,640
Time to grow up, Tommy.

922
01:20:22,284 --> 01:20:26,755
Some days your mother and me loved each
other. Other days we had to work at it.

923
01:20:27,764 --> 01:20:30,642
You never see the hard days
in a photo album.

924
01:20:31,324 --> 01:20:35,795
But those are the ones that get you
from one happy snapshot to the next.

925
01:20:37,684 --> 01:20:43,316
I'm sorry your honeymoon stunk, but that's
what you got dealt. Now work through it.

926
01:20:44,764 --> 01:20:49,394
Sarah doesn't need a guy with
a fat wallet to make her happy.

927
01:20:49,484 --> 01:20:54,558
I saw how you love this girl.
How you two lit each other up.

928
01:20:56,564 --> 01:20:59,397
She doesn't need any more security than that.

929
01:21:04,324 --> 01:21:05,598
Thanks, Dad.

930
01:21:06,924 --> 01:21:08,915
Is it over?

931
01:21:10,684 --> 01:21:12,595
Not even close.

932
01:21:18,884 --> 01:21:22,115
What you do here, Tom Leezak?
You no allowed here no more.

933
01:21:22,204 --> 01:21:23,922
Open the gates, jack-in-the-box.

934
01:21:24,004 --> 01:21:27,599
Me no jack-in-box! You jack-in-box!
Go away now!

935
01:21:27,684 --> 01:21:30,244
Don't make me break my foot off in your ass.

936
01:21:30,324 --> 01:21:32,758
Look, Yuan, I just need to talk to her.

937
01:21:32,844 --> 01:21:35,722
Relationship over. She no like you any more.

938
01:21:35,804 --> 01:21:38,602
- Open the goddamn gate!
- Shut up, Kyle!

939
01:21:38,684 --> 01:21:41,676
Look, Yuan, did she actually
say those words to you?

940
01:21:41,764 --> 01:21:45,040
She say you have kikiwith bimbo.
Same thing.

941
01:21:46,284 --> 01:21:48,593
We are not leaving this intercom.

942
01:21:48,684 --> 01:21:52,916
until Sarah herself confirms
that she is shitcanning Tom!

943
01:21:54,124 --> 01:21:55,159
We're not.

944
01:21:55,244 --> 01:22:00,523
All right, that is damn straight!
This is my wife! Now open up the gate!

945
01:22:00,604 --> 01:22:02,799
Can't we give the guy a chance to explain?

946
01:22:02,884 --> 01:22:04,840
Don't even think about it, Dickie.

947
01:22:05,404 --> 01:22:08,919
Either you're gonna open the gate,
or I'm gonna open the gate.

948
01:22:09,004 --> 01:22:10,483
Either way, I'm coming in!

949
01:22:11,364 --> 01:22:15,880
- We'll sic the hounds on you, Leezak!
- Bring 'em on, Willie!

950
01:22:27,924 --> 01:22:28,913
What's going on?

951
01:22:29,004 --> 01:22:32,360
You leave me no choice!
I'm gonna have to ram the gate!

952
01:22:32,444 --> 01:22:34,514
I am so down with that!

953
01:22:37,124 --> 01:22:38,921
- What we do now?
- Call the cops.

954
01:22:40,524 --> 01:22:42,515
We call SWAT team on your ass!

955
01:22:42,924 --> 01:22:48,715
I'm ramming the gate! I don't know ifyou're
hearing, but I am going to ram your gate!

956
01:22:49,804 --> 01:22:53,479
- What is the commotion in here?
- Tom ram gate.

957
01:23:00,124 --> 01:23:01,796
What the hell is this?

958
01:23:02,204 --> 01:23:04,399
It's go time.

959
01:23:21,404 --> 01:23:23,076
That is one strong gate.

960
01:23:27,004 --> 01:23:27,993
Tom?

961
01:23:42,204 --> 01:23:47,836
Look, Yuan, Willie,
whoever else is listening...

962
01:23:47,924 --> 01:23:52,600
You don't want me to be with Sarah,
and I can't change that.

963
01:23:52,684 --> 01:23:58,395
I don't know where we're gonna be
in ten, 20, 40 years.

964
01:23:58,484 --> 01:24:00,395
I don't know who we're gonna be.

965
01:24:00,484 --> 01:24:04,318
I don't know if I'm ever gonna
be able to give her all ofthis.

966
01:24:05,404 --> 01:24:09,363
There are a million things that I don't know.

967
01:24:09,964 --> 01:24:12,683
But there's one thing that I do.

968
01:24:12,764 --> 01:24:15,642
And that's that I love Sarah.

969
01:24:15,724 --> 01:24:20,081
And I am going to love her
day in and day out

970
01:24:20,164 --> 01:24:22,359
for the rest of my life.

971
01:24:24,364 --> 01:24:26,559
Now, will you please,

972
01:24:27,604 --> 01:24:29,595
please,

973
01:24:30,924 --> 01:24:34,837
open the gate so I can tell that to my wife.

974
01:24:58,364 --> 01:25:00,753
I'm sorry, man.

975
01:25:01,444 --> 01:25:05,835
Sometimes when it's over, it's just over.

976
01:25:26,644 --> 01:25:30,193
Drop the love bomb, baby! Yeah!

977
01:25:35,844 --> 01:25:37,562
Now do you get it?

978
01:25:40,044 --> 01:25:42,194
I love him, Daddy.

979
01:25:43,484 --> 01:25:45,520
Then go get him.

980
01:26:19,924 --> 01:26:22,074
- I'm sorry.
- Me too.

981
01:26:23,724 --> 01:26:26,158
I miss you.

982
01:26:26,244 --> 01:26:28,633
I miss you, too.

983
01:26:29,244 --> 01:26:32,475
I miss wrecking airplane bathrooms
with you.

984
01:26:32,564 --> 01:26:35,032
I miss sleeping with you inside a snowball.

985
01:26:36,884 --> 01:26:39,842
And torching hotels in Europe.

986
01:26:41,724 --> 01:26:45,637
I miss doing time in prison with you.

987
01:26:55,684 --> 01:26:58,482
- Do you wanna try to....?
- Definitely.
