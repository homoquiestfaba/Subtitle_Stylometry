1
00:01:06,032 --> 00:01:08,227
I Iove this!

2
00:01:08,301 --> 00:01:09,928
I Iove you!

3
00:01:11,638 --> 00:01:14,038
Pippa, you're supposed to say--

4
00:01:14,107 --> 00:01:15,768
I can't hear you, Diego.

5
00:01:17,644 --> 00:01:19,976
Pippa, you missed it.
Slow down.

6
00:01:20,046 --> 00:01:21,479
Thank you for everything.

7
00:01:21,548 --> 00:01:23,539
- But I want you to stay.
- That is so sweet.

8
00:01:23,616 --> 00:01:27,017
- Yeah, but, I could come with you.
- I'll call you!

9
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:29,214
- If I miss it.
- Pippa!

10
00:01:51,878 --> 00:01:53,573
Am I having a heart attack?

11
00:01:53,646 --> 00:01:54,874
Can you tell me where this is?

12
00:01:56,216 --> 00:01:57,308
Thank you.

13
00:02:18,771 --> 00:02:21,365
Plane late, traffic. I'm sorry.
It's great to see you.

14
00:02:21,441 --> 00:02:22,738
Go, go.

15
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:24,504
Oh, shit, I only have euros.

16
00:02:24,577 --> 00:02:26,044
Go, please!

17
00:02:30,483 --> 00:02:34,146
Sweetie? Honey?
Mascara. Priorities.

18
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:36,518
- I hate her!
- I know, sweetheart, but you--

19
00:02:36,589 --> 00:02:39,183
I'm sorry.

20
00:02:39,259 --> 00:02:40,419
I'm here, I'm sorry.

21
00:02:40,493 --> 00:02:41,892
I hate you!

22
00:02:41,961 --> 00:02:43,929
Well, that's 'cause you're about
to be forever faithful.

23
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:47,296
I mean, you must hate everyone.
That's why I brought you something blue.

24
00:02:48,735 --> 00:02:52,227
Jeannie! You look gorgeous!

25
00:02:52,305 --> 00:02:53,533
Even from here.

26
00:02:53,606 --> 00:02:54,971
It's called a Brazilian.

27
00:02:57,477 --> 00:02:58,444
Shit!

28
00:02:58,511 --> 00:03:00,706
Oh, my God. OK, let's go.

29
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:02,543
Let's go.

30
00:03:02,615 --> 00:03:03,741
Welcome back, shithead.

31
00:03:03,816 --> 00:03:06,250
- Nice to see you, assface.
- Liar.

32
00:03:15,995 --> 00:03:17,087
Martini?

33
00:03:21,834 --> 00:03:23,802
Keep it handy.

34
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:31,066
- Well done.
- Thank you.

35
00:03:31,144 --> 00:03:33,374
Nothing like a bridesmaid's dress...

36
00:03:33,446 --> 00:03:35,812
to add a subtle sheen
of desperation to any party.

37
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:36,974
Works for you.

38
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:39,177
Oh, totally works. Here.

39
00:03:39,252 --> 00:03:41,186
I can't take it.
It's like Noah's ark in there.

40
00:03:41,254 --> 00:03:42,744
Two by two by shoot me now.

41
00:03:42,822 --> 00:03:44,847
OK, you know what?
Cry me a river.

42
00:03:44,924 --> 00:03:48,382
I'm the one stuck here burning
Cliff and Jane party compilation CDs.

43
00:03:48,461 --> 00:03:49,485
I mean, what did you do today?

44
00:03:49,562 --> 00:03:51,689
I ran with the bulls.

45
00:03:51,764 --> 00:03:54,028
- Is that like a metaphor?
- Then I jumped out of a plane.

46
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:55,590
- Alone?
- I had a guide.

47
00:03:55,668 --> 00:03:56,760
Condoms?

48
00:03:56,836 --> 00:03:59,498
You're the one doing the bushwhacking
over there with Wedding Sex Luke.

49
00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:00,698
Jealous?

50
00:04:00,773 --> 00:04:02,502
Totally.

51
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:04,440
I've slept with everyone here.
I'm radically out of options.

52
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:06,239
I wish you were staying longer
than the weekend.

53
00:04:06,312 --> 00:04:08,280
I'm a travel writer.

54
00:04:08,348 --> 00:04:10,646
You've been "traveling" for 8 years.

55
00:04:10,717 --> 00:04:12,776
What size bra did you guys buy me?

56
00:04:12,852 --> 00:04:14,581
Same as always.

57
00:04:14,654 --> 00:04:16,747
I guess you've matured.

58
00:04:19,225 --> 00:04:20,283
Hey!

59
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:23,591
Now, most of you know that
Jane and Clifford met on the trading floor.

60
00:04:23,663 --> 00:04:26,097
Now, we've all been stimulated
by the stock market recently...

61
00:04:26,165 --> 00:04:30,795
not quite as stimulated
as these two financial lovebirds here.

62
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:34,763
A bear Stern's match made
in bull market heaven.

63
00:04:34,841 --> 00:04:37,571
Oh, my God, it's not a wedding.
It's a merger.

64
00:04:38,444 --> 00:04:42,744
So please raise your glasses
in a toast to the bride and groom.

65
00:04:42,815 --> 00:04:45,113
To marriage,
the happy tomb of love.

66
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:52,883
I'm cutting her off.

67
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:56,087
Oh, come on,
she's celebrating with you, not at you.

68
00:04:56,162 --> 00:04:58,494
She told my father
that he was humpable!

69
00:04:58,564 --> 00:05:02,227
And I'm sure it made his night.
She's wedding phobic.

70
00:05:04,437 --> 00:05:07,497
My boobs are killing me!
I gotta go find my bra.

71
00:05:07,573 --> 00:05:09,871
I love you guys, man!

72
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:15,413
It's over there.

73
00:05:15,481 --> 00:05:17,278
What?

74
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:20,114
Your bra, it's caught
in the edge of that--

75
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:22,553
No, to your left.

76
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:26,022
Your other left.

77
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,731
Thank you.
I must have dropped it.

78
00:05:37,804 --> 00:05:39,066
Beautiful night.

79
00:05:40,206 --> 00:05:42,572
Kind of makes you
feel like swimming.

80
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:45,811
Not really.

81
00:05:45,878 --> 00:05:47,903
Girlfriend? Gay?

82
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:49,709
What? Because I don't want
to go swimming?

83
00:05:49,782 --> 00:05:51,579
Did your girlfriend pick that tie?

84
00:05:53,786 --> 00:05:55,014
What's wrong with it?

85
00:05:55,088 --> 00:05:56,248
Did I say there's
something wrong with it?

86
00:05:56,322 --> 00:05:58,654
Well, if you got something to say
about my tie, feel free to say it.

87
00:05:58,725 --> 00:05:59,851
It's flowery.

88
00:05:59,926 --> 00:06:02,053
It's Boss.

89
00:06:02,128 --> 00:06:03,493
Boss? Sorry.

90
00:06:03,563 --> 00:06:07,260
Don't be. It's always good to hear
what a girl thinks of your tie.

91
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:11,099
Especially a girl in wet pink taffeta.

92
00:06:12,638 --> 00:06:14,105
I didn't pick this dress.

93
00:06:14,173 --> 00:06:15,765
I didn't pick the tie.

94
00:06:17,243 --> 00:06:18,642
Good, then.

95
00:06:21,347 --> 00:06:23,372
Hey, you're soaking wet.

96
00:06:23,449 --> 00:06:25,349
Come on.
Let's get you in a cab.

97
00:06:25,418 --> 00:06:27,511
Forget it.
It's not even midnight.

98
00:06:39,932 --> 00:06:43,459
In some cultures, the closing of the bar
signals the end of the evening.

99
00:06:43,536 --> 00:06:46,835
Well, in some cultures,
men don't follow women around...

100
00:06:46,906 --> 00:06:48,635
when they're not wanted.

101
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:53,277
I think that's a measuring cup.

102
00:06:53,346 --> 00:06:55,712
That is so refreshingly literal.

103
00:06:55,782 --> 00:06:57,579
And you are refreshingly drunk.

104
00:06:57,650 --> 00:07:00,915
I am refreshingly refreshed.
Thank you.

105
00:07:03,556 --> 00:07:05,319
Maybe you should go home.

106
00:07:05,391 --> 00:07:08,485
I just need to find some socks
or something.

107
00:07:08,561 --> 00:07:09,755
My feet are freezing.

108
00:07:09,829 --> 00:07:12,263
Socks, often found in hotel kitchens.

109
00:07:12,331 --> 00:07:13,696
Really?

110
00:07:13,766 --> 00:07:15,290
No.

111
00:07:15,368 --> 00:07:18,201
So, you're literal,
and you're a pessimist.

112
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:22,731
If I was a cook, I would definitely
have a pair of socks on hand...

113
00:07:22,809 --> 00:07:26,301
for like, an unfortunate kitchen accident,
or kitchen spillage.

114
00:07:26,379 --> 00:07:28,074
Sit.

115
00:07:28,147 --> 00:07:29,114
You're not the boss of me.

116
00:07:29,182 --> 00:07:31,343
Enough. OK?

117
00:07:40,993 --> 00:07:43,393
What's wrong with one little kiss?

118
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:45,556
I don't think you'll remember it.

119
00:07:45,631 --> 00:07:46,757
So?

120
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:49,393
Yeah, that's kind of my point.

121
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:52,097
Why don't you just stay
and have a drink?

122
00:07:52,171 --> 00:07:55,106
We can talk all about
your very important point.

123
00:07:55,174 --> 00:07:56,368
I think I better go.

124
00:08:06,185 --> 00:08:08,176
Most of the time...

125
00:08:08,254 --> 00:08:10,313
I don't feel alone.

126
00:08:10,389 --> 00:08:13,415
I travel. I have my life.

127
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:17,327
But sometimes, you know,
you come home...

128
00:08:17,396 --> 00:08:21,059
and it's like everybody's
got somebody to dance with.

129
00:08:21,133 --> 00:08:23,101
We could dance.

130
00:08:31,744 --> 00:08:34,975
The only thing is, Joey,
if we start dancing...

131
00:08:35,047 --> 00:08:37,242
we might as well
throw in the towel.

132
00:08:37,316 --> 00:08:41,218
Start wearing relaxed fit Dockers
and head off to lkea...

133
00:08:41,287 --> 00:08:44,085
to eat meatballs
with our in-vitro twins.

134
00:08:44,156 --> 00:08:45,919
Right, Joey?

135
00:08:49,495 --> 00:08:51,463
Will you make sure
she gets home OK?

136
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:57,032
I got my own money.

137
00:08:57,103 --> 00:08:59,196
Excuse me, do you take euros?

138
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:21,151
What the hell
do you think you're doing?

139
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:22,455
I'm home.

140
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:24,863
Yeah, I can see that.

141
00:09:24,931 --> 00:09:27,263
I didn't want to wake you up.

142
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:30,097
Well, then don't climb up my house
at 2:00 in the morning.

143
00:09:34,807 --> 00:09:37,037
Oh, Philippa.

144
00:09:38,444 --> 00:09:40,969
The key was under the mat.

145
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:49,885
Dad?

146
00:09:49,956 --> 00:09:51,184
I'm sorry.

147
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:58,221
Well, I wish you'd told me
that you were coming home.

148
00:09:58,297 --> 00:10:00,265
You would have baked a cake?

149
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:06,038
I should've. I meant to.

150
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:07,572
I worry about you.

151
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,574
Running around,
doing God knows what.

152
00:10:09,642 --> 00:10:10,870
I'm freelance, you know that.

153
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:14,071
I want you to get a real job,
something that you can commit to...

154
00:10:14,146 --> 00:10:16,011
and start making a life for yourself.

155
00:10:18,017 --> 00:10:19,177
I have a life.

156
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:31,225
Dad? Made you some breakfast.

157
00:10:37,069 --> 00:10:39,333
Sorry about last night.

158
00:10:39,405 --> 00:10:41,396
I was a little jet-lagged.

159
00:10:42,975 --> 00:10:44,237
Dad?

160
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:46,141
Daddy?

161
00:11:36,262 --> 00:11:37,923
What happened?

162
00:11:39,098 --> 00:11:41,726
Daddy. Oh, my God,
I should go get the doctor.

163
00:11:41,801 --> 00:11:43,234
Heart attack? A stroke?

164
00:11:43,302 --> 00:11:45,031
I'm so sorry about last night.

165
00:11:45,104 --> 00:11:47,937
- Both?
- No, no, just a heart attack.

166
00:11:48,007 --> 00:11:51,465
Oh. Well, what a relief.

167
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:54,536
I need my day book.

168
00:11:54,613 --> 00:11:56,171
You didn't bring it with you?

169
00:11:56,248 --> 00:11:58,341
In the ambulance?

170
00:11:58,417 --> 00:12:01,580
I need to call lan. Fill him in.

171
00:12:01,654 --> 00:12:02,985
I'm in trouble here.

172
00:12:03,055 --> 00:12:05,615
Dad, you're in lntensive Care.
I think you should consider relaxing.

173
00:12:05,691 --> 00:12:07,386
Well, that's the difference between us.

174
00:12:09,829 --> 00:12:11,421
Well, I'm here, all right?

175
00:12:11,497 --> 00:12:13,522
So just let me help you.
Tell me what you need.

176
00:12:13,599 --> 00:12:15,794
I need a toothbrush.

177
00:12:15,868 --> 00:12:20,737
I need an editor,
and I need my day book.

178
00:12:20,806 --> 00:12:24,469
Lucy Ward quit.
One of my editors.

179
00:12:24,543 --> 00:12:28,843
No notice. No, the idiot gets an offer
from the Globe she can't refuse.

180
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:32,384
I can do it.

181
00:12:32,451 --> 00:12:35,011
Fine, good. It's on my desk.

182
00:12:35,087 --> 00:12:37,180
No, I can edit
one of your magazines.

183
00:12:41,393 --> 00:12:43,987
I'm a journalist,
I've worked at a dozen magazines.

184
00:12:44,063 --> 00:12:45,997
I can handle it.

185
00:12:46,065 --> 00:12:47,555
Oh, that's terrific.

186
00:12:47,633 --> 00:12:48,600
Which magazine?

187
00:12:48,667 --> 00:12:50,794
You never edited a magazine.

188
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:52,838
I've been watching you for years,
I'm in the business.

189
00:12:52,905 --> 00:12:55,169
Just let me help you,
please, for once.

190
00:12:55,241 --> 00:12:57,573
You never think I can do anything.

191
00:12:57,643 --> 00:12:59,076
Just tell me which magazine.

192
00:12:59,145 --> 00:13:01,204
Lawns and Blooms?

193
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,544
Tennis Quarterly?

194
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:05,140
I mean, it's just until
he's back on his feet...

195
00:13:05,217 --> 00:13:06,707
and then he's gonna hire
someone real.

196
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:08,583
- His words.
- Oh, nice.

197
00:13:08,654 --> 00:13:10,417
Loft Living?

198
00:13:10,489 --> 00:13:13,117
I mean, I guess he's right.
I never edited a magazine.

199
00:13:13,192 --> 00:13:15,251
Well, as long as
it's not Trucks Weekly.

200
00:13:21,767 --> 00:13:22,961
Oh, my God.

201
00:13:23,035 --> 00:13:24,798
It's not Trucks Weekly.

202
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:26,770
Wedding Bells?

203
00:13:26,839 --> 00:13:30,935
Lulu, I offered to edit
a bridal magazine.

204
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:33,979
It's a shrine to commitment,
and I'm a slut.

205
00:13:34,046 --> 00:13:37,573
I'm a fuck-slut half-orphan,
and I start work on Monday.

206
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:40,551
Oh, sweetie.

207
00:13:40,619 --> 00:13:42,450
You're not an orphan.

208
00:13:59,972 --> 00:14:02,463
Oh! Shit!

209
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:17,413
Ms. McGee, I presume.

210
00:14:17,489 --> 00:14:19,457
It's Pippa, please. And you are?

211
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:21,584
Frank. No last name.

212
00:14:22,661 --> 00:14:24,856
- Like Cher?
- Who?

213
00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:27,455
You know, Cher?
She's famous?

214
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:28,761
I'm kidding.

215
00:14:28,834 --> 00:14:31,029
- Funny.
- Well, that's good.

216
00:14:31,103 --> 00:14:33,401
Funny's good in an assistant,
'cause I'm gonna be yours.

217
00:14:33,472 --> 00:14:36,168
Unless, of course, you fire me.
Please don't fire me.

218
00:14:36,242 --> 00:14:38,608
I'm an utter delight in the boardroom,
I can assure you.

219
00:14:38,677 --> 00:14:40,941
"Board" being the operative term.

220
00:14:41,013 --> 00:14:43,208
Now, everyone's
wildly excited to meet you...

221
00:14:43,282 --> 00:14:45,045
never having
heard of you, of course.

222
00:14:45,117 --> 00:14:47,017
Well, let's put a pin
in the touchy-feely stuff...

223
00:14:47,086 --> 00:14:48,883
for the masses await.

224
00:14:48,954 --> 00:14:52,082
Good pants, by the way.
Very shock and awe.

225
00:14:54,093 --> 00:14:56,391
So that's the story.

226
00:14:56,462 --> 00:14:58,623
My dad asked me to fill in.

227
00:14:58,697 --> 00:15:00,631
It's just temporary
until he's back on his feet.

228
00:15:00,699 --> 00:15:04,897
That being said, I am committed
to making the best of this.

229
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:06,904
But I gotta be honest.

230
00:15:06,972 --> 00:15:09,497
I mean, I see marriage
as a kind of a prison.

231
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:13,978
It's a place where freedom
and choice and sensuality go to die.

232
00:15:17,016 --> 00:15:19,177
I mean, I'm still trying
to figure out why...

233
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:23,381
in a world of choice and feminism
and serial monogamy...

234
00:15:23,455 --> 00:15:26,913
in a chaotic universe of infidelity
and couple's counseling...

235
00:15:26,992 --> 00:15:30,393
in a fragmented topography
of divorce and nihilism...

236
00:15:30,462 --> 00:15:34,091
why the modern woman
would want to get married.

237
00:15:34,166 --> 00:15:36,657
I mean, to me, these are
very interesting questions.

238
00:15:38,904 --> 00:15:41,498
Anyway, I guess
what I'm trying to say is...

239
00:15:41,573 --> 00:15:44,872
Iet's push the status quo,
but not be pushed by it.

240
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:47,708
Let's keep things in perspective.
Let's have fun!

241
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:49,247
I'll call them.

242
00:15:58,424 --> 00:15:59,755
Brook Clinic, hello?

243
00:15:59,825 --> 00:16:01,690
Lulu? Can you hear me?

244
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:02,886
Vaguely.

245
00:16:03,028 --> 00:16:04,928
Oh, my God, it works!
I'm Janet Jackson.

246
00:16:05,931 --> 00:16:08,297
Oh, first day, lady.
How's it going over there?

247
00:16:08,367 --> 00:16:10,062
It's a total nightmare,
but I'm faking my way through it.

248
00:16:10,135 --> 00:16:12,569
The walls are pink,
and I can't smoke.

249
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:14,868
- It sucks.
- Well, you sound very positive.

250
00:16:16,275 --> 00:16:17,742
Bad time?

251
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:26,142
How did you find me?

252
00:16:26,218 --> 00:16:27,412
Excuse me?

253
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:28,976
Do you want your money back
from the other night?

254
00:16:29,054 --> 00:16:30,146
What? Hello?

255
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:32,950
I'm actually surprised
you remember.

256
00:16:33,025 --> 00:16:35,255
I guess that's fair.
I was a little jet-lagged.

257
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:37,420
- You were loaded.
- Tomato, tomahto.

258
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:39,828
Right. Let's call the whole thing off.

259
00:16:45,938 --> 00:16:47,929
So who the hell is Philippa McGee?

260
00:16:49,308 --> 00:16:51,674
- You're lan?
- I am.

261
00:16:51,744 --> 00:16:54,110
Ian Gray?
My dad's vice president?

262
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:55,441
I talked to him this morning.

263
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:57,414
He asked me to come down
and supervise the first few weeks...

264
00:16:57,483 --> 00:16:58,609
make sure you were set up.

265
00:16:58,684 --> 00:17:00,845
Well, he said he trusted me with this.

266
00:17:00,919 --> 00:17:02,284
I thought he trusted me.

267
00:17:02,354 --> 00:17:05,482
Guys? I'm gonna be
in that office right there.

268
00:17:05,557 --> 00:17:08,321
Frank? Is this decaf?

269
00:17:08,394 --> 00:17:09,656
- Yes, sir.
- Decaf?

270
00:17:09,728 --> 00:17:11,821
Look, I'm sure he trusts you.

271
00:17:11,897 --> 00:17:13,956
You're his daughter.

272
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:17,025
You're a grown-up.
I'm simply here to--

273
00:17:24,743 --> 00:17:26,904
Meeting's in an hour.

274
00:17:35,521 --> 00:17:38,513
Ms. Nightly? Ms. I.P. Night--

275
00:17:43,095 --> 00:17:45,359
Not funny.
This is a place of work.

276
00:17:45,431 --> 00:17:47,661
I was wondering about the sponge.
Do you think it's too drippy?

277
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:52,193
For you, perhaps I'd suggest something
a little more permanent, like Norplant.

278
00:17:52,271 --> 00:17:54,899
Follow me.

279
00:17:54,973 --> 00:17:56,998
Do you want to go to lunch?
I'm craving sushi.

280
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:58,703
It's 10:30.

281
00:17:58,777 --> 00:17:59,903
Your point?

282
00:17:59,978 --> 00:18:01,206
You're going back to the office.

283
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,339
There's a problem.
It's a little complicated.

284
00:18:03,415 --> 00:18:05,849
Oh, OK, you know what?
It is always complicated...

285
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:10,048
but, honey, you are the boss,
you're in charge.

286
00:18:10,122 --> 00:18:11,851
Just trust your instincts.

287
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:16,151
- I have instincts?
- Oh, yeah, you are all instinct.

288
00:18:16,228 --> 00:18:19,891
Now go. I am watching.
Walk, please, walk.

289
00:18:20,165 --> 00:18:27,298
Hey, guys. I just wanted to liaison
this whole management shuffle situation.

290
00:18:27,372 --> 00:18:30,808
Look, we all know this magazine's
in trouble, all right?

291
00:18:30,876 --> 00:18:34,403
We need to, one, strategize.
Two, compromise. Three--

292
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:35,845
Jazzercise.

293
00:18:38,851 --> 00:18:41,183
Theorize.

294
00:18:41,253 --> 00:18:44,518
Roxanne, could you tell us
a little bit more about our readers?

295
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:47,252
I mean, assuming
that you're all right.

296
00:18:47,326 --> 00:18:49,658
Secondhand smoke, lan,
but thank you for asking.

297
00:18:49,728 --> 00:18:53,323
Our readers are between
the ages of 24 and 31...

298
00:18:53,398 --> 00:18:55,958
engaged, primarily Caucasian--

299
00:18:56,034 --> 00:18:58,559
Engaged middle class white chicks buy
this magazine, that's a shocker.

300
00:19:02,908 --> 00:19:05,376
Is this, like, amusing to you?

301
00:19:05,444 --> 00:19:07,275
I think Pippa's a little jet-lagged.

302
00:19:07,346 --> 00:19:09,974
No, I'm just curious. I mean,
has anyone here ever thought about...

303
00:19:10,048 --> 00:19:13,245
doing something relevant for a change,
something investigative.

304
00:19:13,318 --> 00:19:16,776
OK, divorce statistics,
death of sex in modern marriage...

305
00:19:16,855 --> 00:19:18,982
the religious right, wife beating--

306
00:19:19,057 --> 00:19:20,388
That's not our magazine.

307
00:19:20,459 --> 00:19:22,120
Why not?

308
00:19:22,194 --> 00:19:24,185
We're not re-inventing the wheel here.

309
00:19:24,263 --> 00:19:26,254
I disagree. The wheel is squeaky.

310
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:28,458
It's rattling,
and it's not a friggin' buggy!

311
00:19:28,534 --> 00:19:32,766
I mean, "Giddy up, Old Yeller, let's mosey
on over to the monogrammed napkins."

312
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:35,306
- Old Yeller is a dog.
- Come on!

313
00:19:35,374 --> 00:19:36,636
Look, you want to discuss
a new direction...

314
00:19:36,708 --> 00:19:38,300
fine, we'll do it,
but not in front of the staff.

315
00:19:38,377 --> 00:19:40,072
Wow, you really learned at
the knee of my father, didn't you?

316
00:19:40,145 --> 00:19:42,170
You don't listen, do you?

317
00:19:42,247 --> 00:19:44,579
I want a chance to do this
by myself.

318
00:19:47,953 --> 00:19:49,045
OK.

319
00:19:49,121 --> 00:19:51,419
Anyway, lan has agreed
to leave me alone.

320
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:52,457
At least for the first issue.

321
00:19:52,524 --> 00:19:53,991
I take it your dad likes him.

322
00:19:54,059 --> 00:19:55,890
Totally. He's everything
my dad would love.

323
00:19:55,961 --> 00:19:57,792
He jogs for fun.

324
00:19:57,863 --> 00:20:01,060
He talks about
multitasking and "liaising."

325
00:20:01,133 --> 00:20:02,794
Hello, that's not a verb.

326
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:04,665
Anyway, he has no imagination.

327
00:20:04,736 --> 00:20:07,637
I mean, what is wrong with
a cover shoot at the Sky Deck?

328
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:10,140
Insurance. Access. Weather--

329
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:11,471
OK, that doesn't count,
you're a consultant.

330
00:20:11,543 --> 00:20:14,011
You could find a problem in Paradise
if God paid you enough.

331
00:20:14,079 --> 00:20:17,310
OK, I'm seeing something
like landmark kitsch.

332
00:20:17,382 --> 00:20:21,113
Kind of Post-Structuralist.
Bridal Baudrillard.

333
00:20:21,186 --> 00:20:23,017
Oh, yeah, your dad will love it.

334
00:20:24,756 --> 00:20:25,916
He's out of it.

335
00:20:27,125 --> 00:20:29,593
Certainly makes
conversation easier.

336
00:20:33,198 --> 00:20:34,358
Oh, my God, what is that?

337
00:20:34,433 --> 00:20:36,264
This is a lesson.

338
00:20:36,335 --> 00:20:38,667
Never impulse buy on peyote.

339
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:39,965
No, no, no. I love it.
I love it. Give it.

340
00:20:40,038 --> 00:20:41,005
Sold.

341
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:42,131
Thank you.

342
00:20:43,442 --> 00:20:45,535
Futons are still kind of Zen, right?

343
00:20:45,611 --> 00:20:47,010
Sure. If you're twelve.

344
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:49,946
When did you guys
get so bourgeois?

345
00:20:50,015 --> 00:20:52,711
Oh, sweetie. You're an adult.
You're allowed to buy a bed.

346
00:20:52,784 --> 00:20:55,810
This is good. I'm fine.

347
00:20:55,887 --> 00:20:56,979
Good.

348
00:20:57,055 --> 00:20:58,989
Power to the people.

349
00:20:59,057 --> 00:21:01,423
OK, snappy, groovy, one word.

350
00:21:01,493 --> 00:21:03,427
What's wrong with Wedding Bells?

351
00:21:03,495 --> 00:21:05,486
Two words. OK, ring, rock.

352
00:21:05,564 --> 00:21:07,088
I do.

353
00:21:07,165 --> 00:21:10,066
Oh, you know what?
That's two words. Sorry.

354
00:21:10,135 --> 00:21:11,602
Hi.

355
00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:13,900
Hi. I thought we had
an appointment for noon...

356
00:21:13,972 --> 00:21:15,371
but if this is a bad time--

357
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:18,500
No, no. This is a really good time.
Please come in.

358
00:21:19,878 --> 00:21:21,778
Hemingway Jones,
freelance photographer?

359
00:21:21,847 --> 00:21:24,873
Oh, right. Of course.
Frank, can you get me a coffee?

360
00:21:26,818 --> 00:21:28,012
Great name.

361
00:21:28,086 --> 00:21:30,452
Thanks. My mom wanted me
to be a writer.

362
00:21:30,522 --> 00:21:32,513
Hemingway's a big favorite of mine.

363
00:21:37,796 --> 00:21:40,390
Me, too. Hard to live up to, though.

364
00:21:40,465 --> 00:21:42,023
Running with the bulls
and a bottle of scotch.

365
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:43,863
The fantasy dies hard.

366
00:21:43,935 --> 00:21:45,869
Really? I wouldn't know.

367
00:21:45,937 --> 00:21:47,734
Oh, you wouldn't?

368
00:21:51,043 --> 00:21:52,374
Do you want to get out of here?

369
00:21:52,444 --> 00:21:53,741
I got some kittens...

370
00:21:53,812 --> 00:21:56,042
some fields of flowers
in here somewhere. Hang on.

371
00:21:56,114 --> 00:21:58,582
Can I ask you something?

372
00:21:58,650 --> 00:21:59,912
Honestly...

373
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:03,045
why do you want to work
at Wedding Bells?

374
00:22:03,121 --> 00:22:06,818
Honestly, I just need the money.

375
00:22:06,892 --> 00:22:08,826
Why do you do this?

376
00:22:08,894 --> 00:22:10,953
Why do I do it?
It's just temporary.

377
00:22:11,029 --> 00:22:12,189
I'm a travel writer.

378
00:22:12,264 --> 00:22:14,596
So, you're not a bridal fanatic?

379
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:16,327
I'm not a bridal anything.

380
00:22:17,936 --> 00:22:20,461
What about love?
Together forever?

381
00:22:20,539 --> 00:22:21,665
Two hearts beat as one?

382
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:22,798
You Light Up My Life.

383
00:22:22,874 --> 00:22:24,000
You Don't Send Me
Flowers Anymore.

384
00:22:24,076 --> 00:22:25,373
Quit Playing Games
With My Heart.

385
00:22:25,444 --> 00:22:27,139
Oops, I Did It Again.

386
00:22:29,481 --> 00:22:31,176
You're right. It's total cheese.

387
00:22:31,249 --> 00:22:33,979
I mean, forget the ring.
I'd take a multiple orgasm any day.

388
00:22:34,052 --> 00:22:36,213
Amen.

389
00:22:40,325 --> 00:22:42,020
Good afternoon, Wedding Bells.

390
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:46,756
Miss McGee!
Can we get one thing straight?

391
00:22:46,832 --> 00:22:50,563
I run ad sales.
Ad sales sell ads.

392
00:22:50,635 --> 00:22:51,966
No ads, no magazine.

393
00:22:52,037 --> 00:22:55,837
We manufacture anxiety in our readers,
and, in response, they purchase.

394
00:22:55,907 --> 00:22:57,898
- Roxanne--
- Suffice it to say...

395
00:22:57,976 --> 00:23:03,846
I find your rather whimsical
editorial decisions to be problematic.

396
00:23:03,915 --> 00:23:05,780
For example,
the upcoming cover shoot.

397
00:23:05,851 --> 00:23:09,651
While I'm sure
you find satin and steel...

398
00:23:09,721 --> 00:23:13,020
to be a sassy comment
on post-millennial nuptials...

399
00:23:13,091 --> 00:23:14,422
Betty Crocker will not.

400
00:23:14,493 --> 00:23:16,051
Well, I'm not writing for Betty.

401
00:23:16,128 --> 00:23:18,858
That's correct.
You're not writing.

402
00:23:18,930 --> 00:23:21,694
You're editing.
And here's a thought.

403
00:23:21,767 --> 00:23:23,826
Your blushing readers
want that, too.

404
00:23:25,203 --> 00:23:26,170
Frank!

405
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:28,798
Bauhaus Bride?

406
00:23:28,874 --> 00:23:30,307
Too weird?

407
00:23:31,076 --> 00:23:33,010
- All right. Do it. Hoist her up.
- Right.

408
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:35,740
We want her floating, very ethereal.

409
00:23:35,814 --> 00:23:37,145
I think we've got a bit
of a nipple problem.

410
00:23:37,215 --> 00:23:38,614
Hang on.

411
00:23:38,683 --> 00:23:41,151
Are you all on crack?

412
00:23:41,219 --> 00:23:42,982
No nipples!

413
00:23:43,054 --> 00:23:44,043
What are you doing here?

414
00:23:44,122 --> 00:23:45,646
Protecting my interests.

415
00:23:45,724 --> 00:23:48,158
Birks, Ashley, Tupperware, Tiffany's--

416
00:23:48,226 --> 00:23:49,989
Roxanne, it's not exactly
a beaver shot.

417
00:23:50,061 --> 00:23:52,427
Oh, for Christ's sake, people,
I work on commission.

418
00:23:52,497 --> 00:23:55,660
Hello? Amateur hour.

419
00:23:55,734 --> 00:23:58,532
Come here, honey.
Come on d--

420
00:23:58,603 --> 00:24:00,161
- Whoa! Whoa!
- Easy, easy.

421
00:24:00,238 --> 00:24:02,900
OK, OK. Bring her down now.

422
00:24:02,974 --> 00:24:04,532
Come here.
I have some Band-Aids.

423
00:24:04,609 --> 00:24:05,701
What's wrong with her?

424
00:24:05,777 --> 00:24:07,802
What? Besides the heroin?

425
00:24:07,879 --> 00:24:09,506
Guys, I can see the Band-Aids.

426
00:24:09,581 --> 00:24:11,481
Wake up, you track-marked fish stick.

427
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:12,517
Daddy?

428
00:24:13,819 --> 00:24:15,218
OK, Al. Crank her up.

429
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:16,914
Frank, call an ambulance.

430
00:24:16,988 --> 00:24:19,388
The Bauhaus Bride?
What about the Dead Bride?

431
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:21,551
Is that edgy enough for you?

432
00:24:21,626 --> 00:24:25,221
I need an ambulance to the roof--
Where are we?

433
00:24:25,297 --> 00:24:26,924
Are you sure about this?

434
00:24:29,634 --> 00:24:31,261
Yes.

435
00:24:31,336 --> 00:24:33,429
OK. That's all I need to hear.

436
00:24:39,311 --> 00:24:42,678
"Wedding Bells has been
taken over by aliens.

437
00:24:42,747 --> 00:24:47,707
"Aliens from a loveless planet.
A planet where half-naked anorexics...

438
00:24:47,786 --> 00:24:52,450
"dangle like drowned witches
from beams of steel.

439
00:24:52,524 --> 00:24:55,254
"Perhaps Miss McGee
believes her cynicism...

440
00:24:55,327 --> 00:24:57,659
"will stand out from the crowd,
but frankly--"

441
00:24:57,729 --> 00:24:58,923
I've read it, all right?

442
00:24:58,997 --> 00:25:04,025
"...she's just another rock and roll groupie
who's crashed the wrong damn party."

443
00:25:04,102 --> 00:25:05,694
Any ads pulled yet?

444
00:25:05,770 --> 00:25:08,136
- Eleven.
- Philippa?

445
00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:11,737
Pippa, please.

446
00:25:11,810 --> 00:25:15,371
I don't care. Good-bye.

447
00:25:15,447 --> 00:25:17,347
Don't care what your name is.

448
00:25:17,415 --> 00:25:19,747
Don't care how many time zones
you skipped through...

449
00:25:19,818 --> 00:25:22,946
in your illustrious freelance
travel career.

450
00:25:23,021 --> 00:25:25,990
Roxanne.

451
00:25:26,057 --> 00:25:29,390
All I care about is making
this magazine a success.

452
00:25:29,461 --> 00:25:32,362
Look, the cover's not what I imagined.
I was thinking angel. A floating angel.

453
00:25:32,430 --> 00:25:35,160
"Getting What You're Worth:
A Guide to Bulletproof Prenups"?

454
00:25:35,233 --> 00:25:36,257
It's important to be informed.

455
00:25:36,334 --> 00:25:38,666
"Temptation Honeymoon:
The Tale of a 3-Day Marriage."

456
00:25:38,737 --> 00:25:40,500
That's a true story.

457
00:25:40,572 --> 00:25:42,802
You might as well give it
to the man. Seriously.

458
00:25:42,874 --> 00:25:45,672
Bob Jackman is just sitting there,
waiting for the right moment...

459
00:25:45,744 --> 00:25:47,974
which you just gave to him
on a platter.

460
00:25:48,046 --> 00:25:50,844
Do you not care that your father's
about to lose his company?

461
00:25:50,916 --> 00:25:52,349
All his magazines?

462
00:25:52,417 --> 00:25:54,977
- Bob Jackman's a newspaper guy.
- Well, he's looking to expand.

463
00:25:55,053 --> 00:25:58,955
The guy's collected 51%
of your dad's stock.

464
00:25:59,024 --> 00:26:00,685
Are you serious?

465
00:26:00,759 --> 00:26:03,319
I don't get it. I mean,
you're running this thing.

466
00:26:03,395 --> 00:26:05,727
You won't talk to your dad.
You won't talk to me. It's...

467
00:26:08,066 --> 00:26:09,727
Whatever. You know what?

468
00:26:09,801 --> 00:26:13,362
Just call me when it's over,
'cause this is horseshit.

469
00:26:13,438 --> 00:26:15,463
Dad, you should have told me.

470
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:16,837
I told you I was in trouble.

471
00:26:16,908 --> 00:26:18,933
Well, you didn't tell me
that it was everything.

472
00:26:19,010 --> 00:26:20,637
I mean, I just thought
it was the one magazine.

473
00:26:20,712 --> 00:26:22,976
So, what?
You could screw around?

474
00:26:23,048 --> 00:26:27,849
Have fun? Be cool at
a stupid wedding magazine?

475
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:30,217
It was your mother's.

476
00:26:30,288 --> 00:26:32,882
I thought maybe
that would be enough.

477
00:26:50,275 --> 00:26:53,733
You know, the worst part,
the most embarrassing part...

478
00:26:53,812 --> 00:26:56,872
is that I actually thought
it was gonna be good.

479
00:26:56,948 --> 00:26:58,609
And I just end up
disappointing him.

480
00:26:58,683 --> 00:26:59,707
All right, Pippa, come on.

481
00:26:59,784 --> 00:27:01,718
You can do this.
You just need help.

482
00:27:01,786 --> 00:27:04,016
You surround yourself with
the most boring people you know...

483
00:27:04,089 --> 00:27:08,025
and you just join the status quo
for a few months.

484
00:27:08,093 --> 00:27:09,492
Just like that, huh?

485
00:27:09,561 --> 00:27:14,123
I need a partner in crime and it's you,
so don't make me beg.

486
00:27:15,367 --> 00:27:17,961
The most boring person I know.

487
00:27:18,036 --> 00:27:19,731
Can I help you?

488
00:27:19,804 --> 00:27:22,204
Coffee? Wheat grass?

489
00:27:24,442 --> 00:27:26,205
I need your help.

490
00:27:26,277 --> 00:27:28,177
Look, I screwed up. I'm sorry.

491
00:27:28,246 --> 00:27:31,010
Ian, please,
I need to make this work.

492
00:27:31,082 --> 00:27:33,209
"Marriage is a terrible gamble...

493
00:27:33,284 --> 00:27:35,718
"yet we persist
out of sheer lack of imagination."

494
00:27:35,787 --> 00:27:37,414
I mean, what kind of editor
writes that?

495
00:27:37,489 --> 00:27:39,150
It's a wedding magazine.

496
00:27:39,224 --> 00:27:40,987
Look, there's not a lot of irony
in these magazines.

497
00:27:41,059 --> 00:27:42,617
I'm down with that.

498
00:27:42,694 --> 00:27:45,162
Look, lan, I'm sorry. Please.

499
00:27:48,099 --> 00:27:52,297
All right. I tell you what.
If you can get your staff back on board...

500
00:27:52,370 --> 00:27:57,137
if you can get them to trust you,
respect you maybe, let me know.

501
00:27:58,176 --> 00:28:00,269
OK, then. Tomorrow.
Same time, same place?

502
00:28:06,084 --> 00:28:07,779
My boobs hurt.

503
00:28:25,437 --> 00:28:26,870
OK, thanks.

504
00:28:29,574 --> 00:28:32,008
Pita. Go. Pee.

505
00:28:33,778 --> 00:28:35,473
Go.

506
00:28:36,214 --> 00:28:38,978
Pippa, it's 8:00 in the morning.

507
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:40,381
It's barely an offense...

508
00:28:40,452 --> 00:28:42,647
compared to the butt-ugly thing
on the end of that leash.

509
00:28:43,688 --> 00:28:46,179
- I hate this dog.
- Ex-girlfriend's?

510
00:28:49,327 --> 00:28:50,692
OK, I'm the boss.

511
00:28:50,762 --> 00:28:54,357
Ergo, I am fair, thoughtful,
decisive, and generous.

512
00:28:54,432 --> 00:28:56,491
Look, you want to be able
to ask for the moon.

513
00:28:56,568 --> 00:29:00,299
So, you create an environment
that people actually enjoy.

514
00:29:00,371 --> 00:29:05,035
The staff works later,
harder, smarter.

515
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:07,010
Wow, you sound like the man.

516
00:29:07,078 --> 00:29:09,512
I am the man.

517
00:29:09,581 --> 00:29:11,071
Come on.

518
00:29:12,183 --> 00:29:14,515
Yeah, that's a great idea.
I'm writing that down.

519
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:18,018
OK, Roxanne, what do you want?

520
00:29:18,089 --> 00:29:21,616
I was thinking of a shirtless groom,
popping out of a wedding cake.

521
00:29:21,693 --> 00:29:22,990
Shirtless groom.

522
00:29:32,203 --> 00:29:35,138
Here you go. Careful, it's hot.

523
00:29:37,809 --> 00:29:38,935
Right there.

524
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:52,519
You've gotta know more about
your subject matter than anyone else.

525
00:29:52,590 --> 00:29:54,820
I should get married
and charge it to the magazine.

526
00:29:59,297 --> 00:30:01,765
Oh, storage solution. That's sexy.

527
00:30:01,833 --> 00:30:04,495
You don't have to buy it.
You just have to sell it.

528
00:30:09,507 --> 00:30:10,633
Hold up.

529
00:30:12,143 --> 00:30:14,077
I can't. I've got a thing.

530
00:30:14,145 --> 00:30:15,442
I'm coming in.

531
00:30:17,916 --> 00:30:19,941
OK. Cover shot.
What do you think?

532
00:30:23,321 --> 00:30:24,447
Boring.

533
00:30:26,090 --> 00:30:28,149
Boring. I don't know.

534
00:30:28,226 --> 00:30:29,853
I guess...

535
00:30:29,928 --> 00:30:32,453
You know, I'm not really sure
what you're trying to say here.

536
00:30:32,530 --> 00:30:35,693
It's big, it's puffy, it's white.
Oh, my God, it's a fantasy.

537
00:30:37,035 --> 00:30:39,595
Nuptial bliss.
A day to remember.

538
00:30:39,671 --> 00:30:43,539
Love at first sight.
Memories that last a lifetime.

539
00:30:43,608 --> 00:30:45,371
I'm in a Town Car
with a Magic 8-Ball.

540
00:30:45,443 --> 00:30:47,536
OK, look, just pick a theme
and commit.

541
00:30:49,214 --> 00:30:50,875
You ever thought about
a focus group?

542
00:30:50,949 --> 00:30:53,645
Just get some people together,
people you trust...

543
00:30:53,718 --> 00:30:56,516
ask them what they want to see,
and just interpret it.

544
00:30:57,755 --> 00:30:59,689
OK, you know what? Get out.

545
00:31:02,393 --> 00:31:04,827
So... is that the ex-girlfriend?

546
00:31:04,896 --> 00:31:08,354
Ex-wife. It's...complicated.

547
00:31:10,001 --> 00:31:11,298
I like her.

548
00:31:12,837 --> 00:31:16,136
Rock star, model, V.J., spy?

549
00:31:16,207 --> 00:31:17,504
Surgeon.

550
00:31:18,476 --> 00:31:19,738
Break a leg.

551
00:31:41,933 --> 00:31:44,424
Martinique was fabulous,
but we were so exhausted...

552
00:31:44,502 --> 00:31:45,935
we could barely make it
to the beach.

553
00:31:46,004 --> 00:31:49,064
- Opening presents? Very tiring.
- Throwing the heavy bouquet.

554
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:51,005
Ha ha. You're hilarious.

555
00:31:51,075 --> 00:31:53,543
Commitment takes work, Pippa.

556
00:31:53,611 --> 00:31:54,908
You're still mad at me.

557
00:31:54,979 --> 00:31:57,777
I'm married. Serene.
I'm over it.

558
00:31:57,849 --> 00:32:00,283
You want to start without Rachel?

559
00:32:00,351 --> 00:32:01,716
Oh, fuck me!

560
00:32:01,786 --> 00:32:04,550
The fucking artichoke dip
is on fucking fire again!

561
00:32:04,622 --> 00:32:06,817
Tying the knot hasn't
turned Jane into a cook.

562
00:32:06,891 --> 00:32:09,724
Guess you can't register
for that yet.

563
00:32:09,794 --> 00:32:11,091
Yeah, we can save it.

564
00:32:11,162 --> 00:32:14,029
- I'm not eating it.
- Neither am l.

565
00:32:14,098 --> 00:32:16,191
No, it must have only been
around 300 thread count.

566
00:32:16,267 --> 00:32:17,564
I mean, they didn't even have
Egyptian cotton.

567
00:32:17,635 --> 00:32:20,399
- Oh, my God. That's terrible.
- No, you can't. You just can't.

568
00:32:20,471 --> 00:32:23,838
OK. Now that we all know
that Martinique kicks Fiji's ass...

569
00:32:23,908 --> 00:32:25,341
welcome to the meaning of wife.

570
00:32:25,410 --> 00:32:27,810
I take it you guys all saw
my first issue?

571
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:30,838
Armageddon with sniff inserts.

572
00:32:30,915 --> 00:32:33,008
OK, well, I prepared some questions.

573
00:32:33,084 --> 00:32:34,210
I got one.

574
00:32:36,554 --> 00:32:40,422
I'm 31, right?
So, here's my question.

575
00:32:40,491 --> 00:32:44,757
If I see one more perky-breasted,
loft-living, size 2, yummy mummy...

576
00:32:44,829 --> 00:32:46,694
pushing a pram with
her skateboarding husband...

577
00:32:46,764 --> 00:32:49,028
am I allowed to kill myself?

578
00:32:51,302 --> 00:32:53,236
Honey, you're a very young 31.

579
00:32:53,304 --> 00:32:55,431
Oh, I only got married last month.

580
00:32:55,506 --> 00:32:57,667
Mature brides are
increasingly common.

581
00:32:59,177 --> 00:33:01,236
Holy shit, you actually
feel sorry for us.

582
00:33:03,881 --> 00:33:05,872
OK. All right,
let's just say love is a given.

583
00:33:05,950 --> 00:33:07,713
I mean, what's wrong
with shacking up?

584
00:33:07,785 --> 00:33:10,185
I mean, why do you need the lace
and the place cards--

585
00:33:10,254 --> 00:33:12,017
Did you see the lace on my dress?

586
00:33:12,090 --> 00:33:17,027
I mean, blind Belgian nuns tatting away
with their little blind fingers.

587
00:33:17,095 --> 00:33:18,722
Hello? Better tax breaks.

588
00:33:18,796 --> 00:33:21,321
Oh, come on. I'm a dyke,
and even I want to do it.

589
00:33:23,368 --> 00:33:26,098
I mean, haven't you guys
ever wanted to get married?

590
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:27,831
Never thought about
the big white dress?

591
00:33:27,905 --> 00:33:30,669
I've thought about
the big white dress.

592
00:33:30,742 --> 00:33:32,505
What? I'm a very visual person.

593
00:33:32,577 --> 00:33:34,670
Guys, guys, I'm so sorry.

594
00:33:34,746 --> 00:33:38,443
OK. Take Rachel-- sensible,
modern, ambitious Rachel.

595
00:33:38,516 --> 00:33:41,679
Does Rachel really need
this futile display of commitment?

596
00:33:41,753 --> 00:33:43,243
- Well, actually--
- Does Rachel really want...

597
00:33:43,321 --> 00:33:46,188
to tie herself financially to
some poet who makes $3 a year?

598
00:33:46,257 --> 00:33:47,622
Hey, that's a phase.
It's transitional.

599
00:33:47,692 --> 00:33:50,855
Does Rachel really need a piece of paper
to show the world who she loves?

600
00:33:52,196 --> 00:33:56,326
Guys, Simon asked me
to marry him.

601
00:33:57,402 --> 00:34:00,098
On my way over here.

602
00:34:00,171 --> 00:34:03,504
I told him I was coming over here
to talk about being single, right?

603
00:34:03,574 --> 00:34:08,011
And he said that he'd been thinking
and he didn't want to be single anymore.

604
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:11,640
It's almost as if this focus group
prompted him to...

605
00:34:11,716 --> 00:34:13,946
I don't know, to ask.

606
00:34:14,018 --> 00:34:16,816
Way to go, Pip.

607
00:34:18,089 --> 00:34:19,886
I mean, what the hell happened?

608
00:34:19,957 --> 00:34:21,982
We were going to take over the world.

609
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:23,721
I mean, we were,
every single one of us.

610
00:34:23,795 --> 00:34:25,592
We were going to take over
the goddamn world.

611
00:34:25,663 --> 00:34:28,860
What, married chicks
can't take over the world?

612
00:34:28,933 --> 00:34:31,925
Well, it's not exactly
at the front of their mind.

613
00:34:32,003 --> 00:34:34,597
I don't want to lose myself, you know.
I don't want to just disappear.

614
00:34:34,672 --> 00:34:37,470
Just because your dad is a dick doesn't
mean every guy wants to control you.

615
00:34:37,542 --> 00:34:40,670
- OK, Oprah.
- Luke doesn't want to control me.

616
00:34:40,745 --> 00:34:42,474
Luke...

617
00:34:42,547 --> 00:34:44,845
Luke Tenenbaum?
What's to control?

618
00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:47,043
You guys have sex
once a wedding, right?

619
00:34:51,989 --> 00:34:53,923
I watched my mom till I was 13.

620
00:34:53,991 --> 00:34:56,824
My dad runs an empire,
my mom runs a household.

621
00:34:56,894 --> 00:34:58,828
She started Wedding Bells.

622
00:34:58,896 --> 00:35:00,693
Yeah, then she died.

623
00:35:08,806 --> 00:35:11,400
Pip, we don't have to get married.

624
00:35:11,476 --> 00:35:13,706
What? And miss
the happiest day of my life?

625
00:35:21,219 --> 00:35:22,880
You need to get laid.

626
00:35:24,589 --> 00:35:26,716
You're so right.

627
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:31,089
You couldn't sleep, could you?

628
00:35:34,098 --> 00:35:36,931
Probably tossing and turning.

629
00:35:37,001 --> 00:35:39,561
"Why didn't I call that guy back?"

630
00:35:47,912 --> 00:35:51,370
"Seems nice. Not too short.

631
00:35:51,449 --> 00:35:56,580
"A little artsy, but at least
he's not afraid to take a chance."

632
00:36:00,324 --> 00:36:03,953
No, I could never date
somebody I work with.

633
00:36:05,696 --> 00:36:07,755
I don't know about the dating.

634
00:36:07,832 --> 00:36:10,460
Neither do l.

635
00:36:11,802 --> 00:36:14,032
But...

636
00:36:14,105 --> 00:36:15,663
what if...

637
00:36:20,878 --> 00:36:22,470
What if I didn't know?

638
00:36:28,986 --> 00:36:30,453
What if...

639
00:36:34,325 --> 00:36:35,792
it was a dark...

640
00:36:39,797 --> 00:36:41,389
mysterious...

641
00:36:46,771 --> 00:36:48,762
mystery?

642
00:36:48,839 --> 00:36:50,136
Mysterious mystery?

643
00:36:52,777 --> 00:36:54,677
Close your eyes.

644
00:37:02,353 --> 00:37:05,186
You don't know
who this is, do you?

645
00:37:14,999 --> 00:37:17,229
I couldn't really see for sure.

646
00:37:24,375 --> 00:37:26,309
Doesn't it smell great out here?

647
00:37:26,377 --> 00:37:29,540
- Prozac?
- All earth and grass and sweat?

648
00:37:29,614 --> 00:37:30,581
Zyban? Valium?

649
00:37:30,648 --> 00:37:33,674
I'm on fire!
These business bitches are toast!

650
00:37:33,751 --> 00:37:35,616
I think Frank's found his team sport.

651
00:37:35,686 --> 00:37:37,381
We really are playing like
a team, aren't we?

652
00:37:37,455 --> 00:37:39,889
No, you don't.
Not on my watch you don't! No, sir!

653
00:37:39,957 --> 00:37:41,390
Roxanne!

654
00:37:41,459 --> 00:37:42,858
OK, what's wrong?

655
00:37:42,927 --> 00:37:45,157
Well, ad sales are up,
but I'd say she's getting laid.

656
00:37:45,229 --> 00:37:47,288
Is that the secret
to your good humor, Roxanne?

657
00:37:47,365 --> 00:37:48,423
Jealous.

658
00:37:48,499 --> 00:37:49,966
Next issue-- pick a theme yet?

659
00:37:50,034 --> 00:37:52,559
A theme, right.

660
00:37:52,637 --> 00:37:53,934
Pippa!

661
00:37:54,005 --> 00:37:55,597
Yeah, we're the new school!

662
00:37:55,673 --> 00:37:57,868
Mysterious mystery.

663
00:37:57,942 --> 00:37:59,102
Excuse me?

664
00:37:59,176 --> 00:38:00,165
Pippa, honey, wake up!

665
00:38:00,244 --> 00:38:01,836
I got it!

666
00:38:04,682 --> 00:38:06,445
Yes!

667
00:38:06,517 --> 00:38:08,849
Pick a theme and commit, right?

668
00:38:08,919 --> 00:38:10,045
Yes!

669
00:38:23,534 --> 00:38:25,695
Hey, Lulu, it's me.

670
00:38:25,770 --> 00:38:28,330
Excuse me?
Luke is making you dinner?

671
00:38:31,676 --> 00:38:34,907
This building is way too expensive.

672
00:38:34,979 --> 00:38:37,607
It's a lease.
We lose the building...

673
00:38:37,682 --> 00:38:39,479
move the whole operation
up to Scarborough.

674
00:38:39,550 --> 00:38:42,849
Excuse me. Is there something
you want to share with me here?

675
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:46,014
I'm telling you,
McGee has totally lost his groove.

676
00:38:46,090 --> 00:38:47,250
Seen the latest wedding issue?

677
00:38:47,325 --> 00:38:50,988
Have l? Talk about inmates
taking over the asylum.

678
00:38:51,062 --> 00:38:53,030
I want to get back into
the niche market, you know?

679
00:38:53,097 --> 00:38:55,088
Monster Trucks, Beer Weekly.

680
00:38:55,166 --> 00:38:57,657
- Exactly.
- Bring in some yo-ho.

681
00:38:57,735 --> 00:39:00,135
Throw him a few bucks,
tell him to write about beer.

682
00:39:00,204 --> 00:39:01,330
Genius.

683
00:39:04,642 --> 00:39:07,577
So, Jack was in the elevator.
He's picking apart the building...

684
00:39:07,645 --> 00:39:09,772
he's talking about the company
like he owns it.

685
00:39:09,847 --> 00:39:11,041
Pippa, it's not your fault.

686
00:39:11,115 --> 00:39:13,310
I'm trying so hard to please my dad.

687
00:39:13,384 --> 00:39:16,649
But I just end up disappointing him.
Like always.

688
00:39:16,721 --> 00:39:19,349
It's really starting to wear me down.

689
00:39:19,423 --> 00:39:20,913
And then, this guy--

690
00:39:20,991 --> 00:39:23,152
Pippa, look at me it's not your fault.

691
00:39:23,227 --> 00:39:25,218
If your dad's not gonna talk to you
about this stuff...

692
00:39:25,296 --> 00:39:27,355
there's nothing you can do.

693
00:39:28,866 --> 00:39:30,993
I'm sorry.
I probably wrecked your night.

694
00:39:32,236 --> 00:39:33,726
You didn't wreck my night.

695
00:39:33,804 --> 00:39:35,294
What were you doing?

696
00:39:35,373 --> 00:39:36,806
Just mowing the lawn.

697
00:39:36,874 --> 00:39:37,863
Ian.

698
00:39:37,942 --> 00:39:39,432
I was at a rave.

699
00:39:39,510 --> 00:39:40,477
Come on.

700
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:42,876
Poker night. It's no big deal.

701
00:39:42,947 --> 00:39:44,642
Please don't tell me
you had a really good hand.

702
00:39:44,715 --> 00:39:46,012
Royal flush.

703
00:39:46,083 --> 00:39:49,519
Oh, God. I'm sorry.

704
00:39:49,587 --> 00:39:51,680
Hey, it's Friday night.
You know, you should...

705
00:39:51,756 --> 00:39:53,553
I know.
Work later, harder, smarter.

706
00:39:53,624 --> 00:39:54,852
No, you know what you're doing.

707
00:39:54,925 --> 00:39:57,416
Take the night off.
Go see your guy.

708
00:39:59,764 --> 00:40:00,890
My guy?

709
00:40:00,965 --> 00:40:03,661
That...guy.

710
00:40:05,035 --> 00:40:06,468
He's not my guy.

711
00:40:06,537 --> 00:40:08,198
Oh, really?

712
00:40:08,272 --> 00:40:10,297
- I don't do that.
- Do what?

713
00:40:10,374 --> 00:40:11,568
- You know.
- No.

714
00:40:11,642 --> 00:40:12,802
Relationships.

715
00:40:12,877 --> 00:40:15,903
Oh. I see.

716
00:40:19,550 --> 00:40:22,883
Anyway, I'm just gonna stay a bit
and go through these mock-ups.

717
00:40:22,953 --> 00:40:24,978
But thank you. Seriously.

718
00:40:27,758 --> 00:40:29,521
Hey...

719
00:40:29,593 --> 00:40:31,458
Have a good night, OK?

720
00:40:33,931 --> 00:40:35,796
Yeah. You, too.

721
00:40:52,683 --> 00:40:55,311
Dad. You should have called me.

722
00:40:55,386 --> 00:40:57,820
It's OK. We--we took a cab.

723
00:40:57,888 --> 00:41:00,584
- Suzanne...
- If you want to grab the bags--

724
00:41:00,658 --> 00:41:03,559
Dad, I can do this, OK?
We don't need a nurse. No offense.

725
00:41:03,627 --> 00:41:07,188
Oh, I suspect your hands
are full these days.

726
00:41:07,264 --> 00:41:09,926
Malcolm told me you had
a conference this weekend.

727
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,900
I think it's best
if someone's with him.

728
00:41:11,969 --> 00:41:13,266
I don't need to go.

729
00:41:13,337 --> 00:41:15,271
It's fine.
Just go to the conference.

730
00:41:15,339 --> 00:41:17,034
We'll be fine.

731
00:41:18,742 --> 00:41:21,836
OK. Welcome home.

732
00:41:37,962 --> 00:41:40,157
You're not Roxanne.

733
00:41:40,231 --> 00:41:42,426
I suppose that's a slight consolation.

734
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:44,024
Aren't I supposed to be
driving her to Niagara Falls?

735
00:41:44,101 --> 00:41:45,295
I think that's right.

736
00:41:45,369 --> 00:41:47,564
Yes. Sadly, there's a conflict.

737
00:41:47,638 --> 00:41:51,130
Wedding Expo in Niagara Falls,
advertising conference in Kingston.

738
00:41:51,208 --> 00:41:52,402
She didn't tell me.

739
00:41:53,577 --> 00:41:55,135
She forgot.

740
00:42:00,985 --> 00:42:03,954
You do realize
you're an hour and a half late.

741
00:42:04,021 --> 00:42:07,081
I take it Prada Boy
operates by sundial.

742
00:42:09,126 --> 00:42:11,686
I was only like--Oh, shit.

743
00:42:11,762 --> 00:42:13,127
Sorry.

744
00:42:13,197 --> 00:42:14,528
But we're not late.

745
00:42:14,598 --> 00:42:15,895
You got your speech ready?

746
00:42:15,966 --> 00:42:18,662
It's informal, right?
It's, like, meet and greet.

747
00:42:25,009 --> 00:42:27,705
Oh, my God.
Keynote speaker?

748
00:42:27,778 --> 00:42:30,542
What the hell am I gonna talk about?

749
00:42:30,614 --> 00:42:33,174
I guess I could talk about
being a bridesmaid...

750
00:42:33,250 --> 00:42:34,512
but I never remember it.

751
00:42:34,585 --> 00:42:36,212
That's a promising thesis statement.

752
00:42:36,287 --> 00:42:38,812
Take a left. Other left.

753
00:42:46,297 --> 00:42:48,288
What is it with you and the antiques?

754
00:42:48,365 --> 00:42:50,697
Reminds me of something.

755
00:42:50,768 --> 00:42:52,895
What?
A hot night with Laura lngalls?

756
00:42:54,572 --> 00:42:57,234
You don't see the possibilities
in this bed?

757
00:42:57,308 --> 00:43:01,472
You know, I would've thought
an adventurous person like yourself...

758
00:43:03,113 --> 00:43:04,637
Good mattress, too.

759
00:43:04,715 --> 00:43:06,910
Assuming you like them hard.

760
00:43:10,321 --> 00:43:11,686
Yeah.

761
00:43:13,824 --> 00:43:17,385
Well, then you'd like this one.

762
00:43:17,461 --> 00:43:18,621
Don't you have a bed?

763
00:43:18,696 --> 00:43:21,563
It was my ex-wife's.
She wanted it back.

764
00:43:23,534 --> 00:43:24,831
You didn't get another one?

765
00:43:24,902 --> 00:43:27,837
I'm looking. All right?

766
00:43:27,905 --> 00:43:29,395
Well, you should get this one.
It's cool. I like it.

767
00:43:29,473 --> 00:43:30,701
You ready?

768
00:43:32,109 --> 00:43:34,771
Oh, I get it. You gotta measure the bed,
measure the space.

769
00:43:34,845 --> 00:43:36,005
Comparison shopping.

770
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:37,274
Yeah, yeah. Come on.

771
00:43:42,086 --> 00:43:43,576
You think you know how I live?

772
00:43:43,654 --> 00:43:44,712
You're a numbers guy.

773
00:43:44,788 --> 00:43:47,120
You go to bed at 11 :00,
you wake up at 7:00.

774
00:43:47,191 --> 00:43:49,785
You run 5 miles, you save 10%%.

775
00:43:49,860 --> 00:43:51,555
You probably got that
from your dad.

776
00:43:51,629 --> 00:43:54,097
And you get the antiques thing
from your old-money mom.

777
00:43:54,164 --> 00:43:57,895
They make you feel comfortable
in a cold, cold world.

778
00:43:57,968 --> 00:44:00,801
I bet you still sleep
on your futon from college.

779
00:44:00,871 --> 00:44:03,396
I do not.

780
00:44:03,474 --> 00:44:04,873
Over Daddy's garage.

781
00:44:05,809 --> 00:44:06,935
He told you?

782
00:44:07,011 --> 00:44:09,309
It's a lucky guess.

783
00:44:09,380 --> 00:44:15,410
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome
to the industry's premiere Bridal Expo.

784
00:44:15,486 --> 00:44:20,355
We're going to kick off the festivities with
our keynote speaker, Philippa McGee...

785
00:44:20,424 --> 00:44:24,485
brand-new editor
of Wedding Bells magazine.

786
00:44:33,937 --> 00:44:35,063
Hi.

787
00:44:37,341 --> 00:44:39,275
Sorry.

788
00:44:39,343 --> 00:44:41,368
OK.

789
00:44:41,445 --> 00:44:43,003
Can I just level with you?

790
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:45,640
I have never been married.

791
00:44:45,716 --> 00:44:50,050
I've never even had a relationship
that lasted longer than a month.

792
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:52,281
I've never edited a magazine.

793
00:44:52,356 --> 00:44:56,588
I have never thought twice about
diamonds or veils or honeymoons.

794
00:44:56,660 --> 00:45:01,188
But I took this job for my father.
You all know him, right?

795
00:45:01,265 --> 00:45:05,759
And I took it for my mother,
the woman who started it all.

796
00:45:13,777 --> 00:45:16,507
Taking this job meant...

797
00:45:16,580 --> 00:45:18,878
embracing a part of myself
that I had locked away...

798
00:45:18,949 --> 00:45:21,008
even from myself.

799
00:45:21,085 --> 00:45:23,849
Pippa McGee, the romantic.

800
00:45:23,921 --> 00:45:25,946
Seriously,
I was a bridesmaid recently...

801
00:45:26,023 --> 00:45:30,585
and at the end of the night,
I was in tears.

802
00:45:30,661 --> 00:45:36,065
Tears of anticipation
and joy and hope...

803
00:45:36,133 --> 00:45:39,193
hope that, someday soon,
my prince would come...

804
00:45:39,269 --> 00:45:42,500
and l, too, would have
a fabulous white wedding.

805
00:45:45,743 --> 00:45:49,372
So, everyone, let's drink up
because our industry celebrates...

806
00:45:49,446 --> 00:45:52,472
the most important thing
in this whole war-torn world...

807
00:45:52,549 --> 00:45:54,483
and that is true love.

808
00:46:15,873 --> 00:46:17,670
I think I nailed it.

809
00:46:17,741 --> 00:46:20,835
To the wall.
What a crock of shit.

810
00:46:20,911 --> 00:46:23,675
Pippa McGee, romantic,
weeping tears of hope...

811
00:46:23,747 --> 00:46:27,183
and joy and, oh, my God,
anticipation?

812
00:46:27,251 --> 00:46:29,219
You don't have to buy it.
You just have to sell it, right?

813
00:46:29,286 --> 00:46:31,516
I mean, pick a theme and commit.

814
00:46:31,588 --> 00:46:32,680
You're right.

815
00:46:32,756 --> 00:46:35,623
You know, Cinderella and her prince,
together forever, it's not original...

816
00:46:35,692 --> 00:46:37,182
but it's definitely an archetype.

817
00:46:37,261 --> 00:46:38,558
OK, congratulations.

818
00:46:38,629 --> 00:46:39,960
Why are you mad at me?

819
00:46:40,030 --> 00:46:41,964
I'm not. I'm--

820
00:46:43,967 --> 00:46:46,299
Your speech tonight--

821
00:46:46,370 --> 00:46:48,463
If you could have told the truth,
what would you have said?

822
00:46:50,841 --> 00:46:53,708
I guess I would have said...

823
00:46:53,777 --> 00:46:55,972
that, to me,
it all feels like bullshit.

824
00:46:56,046 --> 00:46:59,140
I mean, I think
this industry allows...

825
00:46:59,216 --> 00:47:03,448
No, condemns people to focus
exclusively on the small stuff.

826
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:06,148
Hearts, hydrangeas,
hors d'oeuvres.

827
00:47:06,223 --> 00:47:08,054
Anything to distract you
from the fact...

828
00:47:08,125 --> 00:47:10,025
that you're committing
to some stranger...

829
00:47:10,093 --> 00:47:12,061
for the rest of your life.

830
00:47:21,305 --> 00:47:23,330
Can I buy you a drink?

831
00:47:26,677 --> 00:47:27,803
I won again!

832
00:47:27,878 --> 00:47:29,675
Like hell, Cheater McGee.

833
00:47:29,746 --> 00:47:31,771
First place you had sex.

834
00:47:31,849 --> 00:47:34,317
How do you know I've had sex?

835
00:47:34,384 --> 00:47:36,443
Truth.

836
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:39,819
Canoe. Tippy.
I wouldn't recommend it.

837
00:47:39,890 --> 00:47:43,690
OK, worst pick-up line
you ever used to get laid.

838
00:47:45,128 --> 00:47:48,757
I once told a grad student
I'd studied with Derrida in Paris.

839
00:47:48,832 --> 00:47:49,992
And that worked?

840
00:47:50,067 --> 00:47:52,433
She was very into
postmodernism.

841
00:47:52,502 --> 00:47:54,663
OK. Best moment
of your life to date.

842
00:47:54,738 --> 00:47:57,764
The night I quit law school.

843
00:47:57,841 --> 00:48:00,639
I walked in, quit, walked out.

844
00:48:00,711 --> 00:48:03,737
Went down to
this little sailboat I bought...

845
00:48:03,814 --> 00:48:06,214
poured myself a scotch...

846
00:48:06,283 --> 00:48:10,049
Iay back on the deck,
watched the sky go black.

847
00:48:11,855 --> 00:48:13,652
What happened to the boat?

848
00:48:15,459 --> 00:48:17,256
I got married.

849
00:48:17,327 --> 00:48:19,124
Put it in storage.

850
00:48:19,196 --> 00:48:21,528
Dr. Feelgood's not a big sailor?

851
00:48:21,598 --> 00:48:23,327
Not so much.

852
00:48:24,801 --> 00:48:26,928
OK.

853
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:32,140
Worst moment of your life.

854
00:48:41,151 --> 00:48:45,212
OK, I was 13. It was
my first time at summer camp.

855
00:48:45,289 --> 00:48:47,519
I wasn't really fitting in.

856
00:48:47,591 --> 00:48:50,151
So I called home to talk to my mom.

857
00:48:50,227 --> 00:48:54,721
The housekeeper told me
that she died the day before.

858
00:48:54,798 --> 00:48:57,426
She thought I knew.
She thought my dad told me.

859
00:49:03,307 --> 00:49:05,104
Pippa, I'm sorry.

860
00:49:06,743 --> 00:49:08,540
She was sick a long time.

861
00:49:08,612 --> 00:49:10,409
He was busy.

862
00:49:15,485 --> 00:49:17,419
So, why'd your marriage end?

863
00:49:17,487 --> 00:49:18,784
I don't know.

864
00:49:20,090 --> 00:49:21,682
We stopped talking.

865
00:49:23,961 --> 00:49:27,897
A secret nobody knows.
That's a question.

866
00:49:29,199 --> 00:49:31,599
My nails are fake. I bite them.

867
00:49:33,704 --> 00:49:34,762
You?

868
00:49:37,741 --> 00:49:40,437
My first name is not lan.

869
00:49:50,988 --> 00:49:53,252
Lake? Like, swimming in a lake?

870
00:49:53,323 --> 00:49:57,589
Considering my sisters are Whistler,
Trilly, and Hiya, I think I'm doing OK.

871
00:49:57,661 --> 00:50:00,221
- Hippies?
- No shit.

872
00:50:03,700 --> 00:50:05,224
All right, I'm going for a dare.

873
00:50:05,302 --> 00:50:06,360
All right.

874
00:50:06,436 --> 00:50:08,802
Do you see that woman over there?

875
00:50:08,872 --> 00:50:10,567
I'm not sure that's a woman.

876
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:11,971
I think she wants to dance.

877
00:50:20,650 --> 00:50:23,084
Hi. Would you like to dance?

878
00:50:23,153 --> 00:50:24,279
Sure.

879
00:50:29,159 --> 00:50:30,490
Guess I got lucky.

880
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:32,619
You go, girl.

881
00:50:32,696 --> 00:50:34,596
Lucky bitch.

882
00:50:55,685 --> 00:50:58,051
Right.

883
00:51:00,690 --> 00:51:02,783
Yeah.

884
00:51:02,859 --> 00:51:05,453
Yeah!

885
00:51:15,539 --> 00:51:17,564
Turn.

886
00:51:45,168 --> 00:51:49,502
Hey, you gotta see this.
I swear to God, I'm in Elvis' groin.

887
00:51:52,342 --> 00:51:55,778
I mean, if Elvis was
one of the Seven Dwarves.

888
00:51:59,015 --> 00:52:00,505
Oh, my God.

889
00:52:14,564 --> 00:52:18,557
I got you something,
a little souvenir.

890
00:52:19,603 --> 00:52:20,695
Are you in?

891
00:52:22,606 --> 00:52:24,198
Hey...

892
00:52:25,375 --> 00:52:26,637
Come on.

893
00:52:28,912 --> 00:52:31,278
Can't hear you.

894
00:52:36,753 --> 00:52:38,050
What are you doing?

895
00:52:38,121 --> 00:52:39,520
Does it matter?

896
00:52:44,694 --> 00:52:46,457
Jesus, Pippa.

897
00:52:47,564 --> 00:52:51,261
Yes, it matters.

898
00:52:51,334 --> 00:52:53,165
What are you gonna do?

899
00:52:53,236 --> 00:52:55,670
Put me in a cab and send me home?

900
00:52:55,739 --> 00:52:57,866
Why are you so hard on me?

901
00:53:02,012 --> 00:53:03,445
It's just...

902
00:53:04,814 --> 00:53:08,443
You know, most of the time,
you are so brave.

903
00:53:08,518 --> 00:53:10,679
You know, you are right out there...

904
00:53:10,754 --> 00:53:12,449
saying what you think,
doing what you want.

905
00:53:12,522 --> 00:53:14,649
I mean, I envy you.

906
00:53:14,724 --> 00:53:16,316
I do.

907
00:53:18,862 --> 00:53:21,626
But then, it just stops.

908
00:53:21,698 --> 00:53:24,633
I mean, you shut it off.
You just get so cool.

909
00:53:24,701 --> 00:53:29,035
You know? Just cold to anything
that actually matters.

910
00:53:29,105 --> 00:53:30,629
Things like Wedding Bells?

911
00:53:35,245 --> 00:53:38,476
I'm such an idiot. I planned
this whole stupid thing.

912
00:53:38,548 --> 00:53:42,382
I wanted to get you up here
to talk to you. I don't--

913
00:53:42,452 --> 00:53:44,181
God, it doesn't even matter.

914
00:53:44,254 --> 00:53:46,779
You planned this?

915
00:53:51,228 --> 00:53:52,991
Sort of.

916
00:53:53,063 --> 00:53:54,621
Why?

917
00:54:01,438 --> 00:54:03,406
Because you...

918
00:54:08,378 --> 00:54:11,040
Because I really like you.

919
00:56:43,867 --> 00:56:46,131
Philippa, I'm really worried
about you.

920
00:56:47,404 --> 00:56:48,564
You are?

921
00:56:49,639 --> 00:56:51,334
Yes, I am.

922
00:56:53,309 --> 00:56:57,473
Good. I'm glad that we could
have this conversation.

923
00:56:58,815 --> 00:57:03,479
Because I'm feeling
really lost and...

924
00:57:03,553 --> 00:57:06,317
I've been thinking about Mom.

925
00:57:08,057 --> 00:57:09,820
I'm talking about the magazine.

926
00:57:12,095 --> 00:57:14,029
Suze?

927
00:57:14,097 --> 00:57:15,462
Suze?

928
00:57:15,532 --> 00:57:17,693
Here's that file you wanted, Malcolm.

929
00:57:17,767 --> 00:57:18,893
Thank you.

930
00:57:19,936 --> 00:57:21,699
Nice to see you again, Philippa.

931
00:57:21,771 --> 00:57:25,104
So, ad sales. Now, they're still
way down from last month.

932
00:57:25,175 --> 00:57:26,472
Well, we're working on
getting them back.

933
00:57:26,543 --> 00:57:29,205
We have a really solid issue
in the works.

934
00:57:29,279 --> 00:57:30,769
So you got it covered?

935
00:57:30,847 --> 00:57:32,815
We haven't locked one in yet,
but I have some great ideas.

936
00:57:32,882 --> 00:57:35,043
Ian! Hey, come on in.

937
00:57:35,118 --> 00:57:36,676
Hi, Malcolm.

938
00:57:37,687 --> 00:57:39,018
I think I'll make a pot of coffee.

939
00:57:39,088 --> 00:57:40,885
All right, good. Have a seat.

940
00:57:41,925 --> 00:57:43,017
Hey, buddy.

941
00:57:43,092 --> 00:57:46,528
So, what's the first thing
that I taught you about ad sales?

942
00:57:49,566 --> 00:57:52,034
A fat magazine is a happy magazine.

943
00:57:52,101 --> 00:57:54,228
That's right. I need you to make sure
that Philippa understands it.

944
00:57:54,304 --> 00:57:57,398
- Dad--
- So, why don't we say it together?

945
00:58:00,210 --> 00:58:02,405
Come on.

946
00:58:02,479 --> 00:58:03,810
Philippa.

947
00:58:06,282 --> 00:58:09,342
A fat magazine is a happy magazine.

948
00:58:09,419 --> 00:58:12,911
Now, I need to make sure
that you are focusing on Philippa...

949
00:58:12,989 --> 00:58:17,016
and giving her all the hands-on attention
that she needs right now.

950
00:58:17,093 --> 00:58:19,653
I'd say Pippa's pretty hands-on.

951
00:58:23,199 --> 00:58:24,461
Oh.

952
00:58:31,541 --> 00:58:32,838
What happened this morning?

953
00:58:32,909 --> 00:58:34,843
I had a lot of work
I had to get back to.

954
00:58:36,980 --> 00:58:38,880
OK, what are you doing?

955
00:58:38,948 --> 00:58:40,506
- Nothing.
- Nothing?

956
00:58:48,658 --> 00:58:50,353
Jesus Christ.

957
00:59:14,417 --> 00:59:16,317
That's crazy. Pippa!

958
00:59:16,386 --> 00:59:18,581
Pippa, you've got to hear this.

959
00:59:18,655 --> 00:59:21,351
This dude that plays in my band...

960
00:59:21,424 --> 00:59:27,420
he was X-ing so hard that
he passed out on stage!

961
00:59:27,497 --> 00:59:29,931
What else?
What happened after that?

962
00:59:34,137 --> 00:59:35,900
Want to go get a coffee
or something?

963
00:59:35,972 --> 00:59:38,031
Jesus, what? Spit it out.

964
00:59:39,676 --> 00:59:43,043
OK, what do you do if you're having
a good time with someone?

965
00:59:43,112 --> 00:59:45,876
What do you do?
You run like you're on fire.

966
00:59:45,949 --> 00:59:49,407
Me? I just jump
in the bushes with them.

967
00:59:51,020 --> 00:59:52,214
How good?

968
00:59:52,288 --> 00:59:54,415
Quite good.

969
00:59:54,490 --> 00:59:56,720
You run yet?

970
01:00:01,397 --> 01:00:03,797
OK. You know what?

971
01:00:03,866 --> 01:00:07,302
This... No.

972
01:00:07,370 --> 01:00:11,830
You, my darling, are damaged.

973
01:00:14,477 --> 01:00:16,638
Get over it.

974
01:00:16,713 --> 01:00:18,180
Go get him.

975
01:00:26,055 --> 01:00:28,319
Yes, sir. I understand.

976
01:00:28,391 --> 01:00:31,656
Honestly, Mr. Jackman,
I'm ready to start anytime.

977
01:00:31,728 --> 01:00:35,357
Well, between you and me,
Malcolm's not in top form.

978
01:00:35,431 --> 01:00:37,023
He might even be relieved.

979
01:00:37,100 --> 01:00:39,728
I mean, he would never
admit that, but...

980
01:00:39,802 --> 01:00:41,133
Yes, I agree.

981
01:00:41,204 --> 01:00:43,434
Right now, Wedding Bells
is proving to be a loss leader.

982
01:00:43,506 --> 01:00:46,134
If it doesn't start performing,
we pull it.

983
01:00:46,209 --> 01:00:47,608
No, I understand.

984
01:00:47,677 --> 01:00:49,770
You have some very interesting
ideas for a relaunch.

985
01:00:50,113 --> 01:00:51,410
- Wow.
- I know.

986
01:00:51,481 --> 01:00:53,540
Ian's working with Jackman
behind my dad's back.

987
01:00:53,616 --> 01:00:54,640
That's unbelievable.

988
01:00:54,717 --> 01:00:58,778
What an asshole.
Did you tell your father?

989
01:00:58,855 --> 01:01:00,288
Not until I have a strategy.

990
01:01:00,356 --> 01:01:03,689
If I tell him his golden boy's a Judas,
then he might have another heart attack.

991
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:04,920
What a drag.

992
01:01:04,994 --> 01:01:07,519
Apparently they're all just waiting
for my next issue to fail...

993
01:01:07,597 --> 01:01:09,622
and then they can pull the plug
on the whole company.

994
01:01:12,001 --> 01:01:13,298
Hem?

995
01:01:16,372 --> 01:01:18,397
No, I get it. I totally get it.

996
01:01:18,474 --> 01:01:20,305
It's like they're just
looking for an excuse.

997
01:01:20,376 --> 01:01:22,139
Well, I'm not gonna give it to them.

998
01:01:22,211 --> 01:01:25,738
All right, so I can't trust lan,
so I won't tell him what I'm doing...

999
01:01:25,815 --> 01:01:28,579
because I know what I'm doing.

1000
01:01:28,651 --> 01:01:31,279
OK, cover story--
Cinderella, fairy tales...

1001
01:01:31,354 --> 01:01:34,619
Balls, slippers, society brides.

1002
01:01:34,691 --> 01:01:35,953
You're good at this. Keep going.

1003
01:01:36,025 --> 01:01:38,960
Oh, dippy debutantes
and the men who marry them.

1004
01:01:39,028 --> 01:01:41,622
InStyle magazine meets...

1005
01:01:41,698 --> 01:01:43,393
The Great Gatsby?

1006
01:01:43,466 --> 01:01:44,626
I love it.

1007
01:01:44,701 --> 01:01:46,328
Gatsby.

1008
01:01:50,206 --> 01:01:51,969
OK, are you cool, Pippa?

1009
01:01:52,041 --> 01:01:54,976
I'm cool.
Cindy, you look beautalicious.

1010
01:01:55,044 --> 01:01:56,636
All right, give me a little bit more.

1011
01:01:56,713 --> 01:01:59,841
You've got a secret.
I've got a secret.

1012
01:02:01,884 --> 01:02:04,717
A little more. A little--

1013
01:02:07,390 --> 01:02:09,324
I can't do this.

1014
01:02:09,392 --> 01:02:11,155
- What's--
- I just can't do this.

1015
01:02:11,227 --> 01:02:12,660
What's going on?

1016
01:02:12,729 --> 01:02:14,356
Do you want to deal with that?

1017
01:02:16,232 --> 01:02:19,759
I'm so sorry I was crying before.
I feel much better.

1018
01:02:19,836 --> 01:02:21,770
All right. I'm cool.
Are you cool?

1019
01:02:21,838 --> 01:02:24,966
Here we go. One more time.
Excellent, excellent.

1020
01:02:25,041 --> 01:02:26,872
I'm getting married!

1021
01:02:26,943 --> 01:02:29,104
There we go.

1022
01:02:29,178 --> 01:02:30,611
Hold it, hold it, hold it.

1023
01:02:30,680 --> 01:02:32,113
I'm getting...

1024
01:02:32,181 --> 01:02:33,876
I'm getting married.

1025
01:02:34,951 --> 01:02:36,851
Jesus Christ.

1026
01:03:10,219 --> 01:03:12,153
Lovely.

1027
01:03:12,221 --> 01:03:14,018
Lovely.

1028
01:03:26,836 --> 01:03:28,098
Congratulations.

1029
01:03:28,171 --> 01:03:32,130
Your society bride cover
was nominated for an N.M.A.

1030
01:03:32,208 --> 01:03:35,234
It's, uh, National Magazine Award.

1031
01:03:35,311 --> 01:03:36,869
The gala's next week.

1032
01:03:36,946 --> 01:03:38,243
- No way!
- Hey!

1033
01:03:38,314 --> 01:03:41,545
That's unbelievable!
Roxanne, did you hear that?

1034
01:03:41,617 --> 01:03:43,380
You guys should celebrate.

1035
01:03:43,452 --> 01:03:45,044
Congratulations.

1036
01:03:45,121 --> 01:03:46,349
Thank you.

1037
01:03:46,422 --> 01:03:49,050
Thank you. Oh, thank you.

1038
01:03:49,125 --> 01:03:50,956
Thank you.

1039
01:03:51,027 --> 01:03:53,757
I got calls from, like,
three fashion magazines.

1040
01:03:53,830 --> 01:03:57,231
These agents calling,
wanting me to direct their video.

1041
01:03:57,300 --> 01:03:58,927
I mean, it's my time, man.

1042
01:04:00,503 --> 01:04:02,198
What happened to the sarong?

1043
01:04:02,271 --> 01:04:04,899
I think I'm about to get dumped.

1044
01:04:07,577 --> 01:04:09,272
I thought I'd wear something
a little more masculine...

1045
01:04:09,345 --> 01:04:11,370
and really break his heart.

1046
01:04:11,447 --> 01:04:12,880
Sweetie, what happened?

1047
01:04:12,949 --> 01:04:16,350
Couriers.
Notoriously unwilling to commit.

1048
01:04:16,419 --> 01:04:18,649
It's all that traveling, I guess.

1049
01:04:18,721 --> 01:04:20,484
You know, my neighbor's single.

1050
01:04:20,556 --> 01:04:21,921
Straight people slay me.

1051
01:04:21,991 --> 01:04:25,483
Always trying to set us up with the one
other gay guy they happen to know.

1052
01:04:25,561 --> 01:04:29,361
Back off, I'm a good yenta.
His name's Raphael. He's cute.

1053
01:04:29,432 --> 01:04:32,128
Raphael? Shit, back waxer.

1054
01:04:32,201 --> 01:04:35,227
I'll see if he's free next week.
You could go to the awards.

1055
01:04:38,241 --> 01:04:43,702
I guess lan's not going to be joining us
for the pole dancing this evening, huh?

1056
01:04:48,551 --> 01:04:50,485
It's not exactly his scene.

1057
01:04:50,553 --> 01:04:51,850
No.

1058
01:04:51,921 --> 01:04:54,583
Now there is a man
I would dress down for.

1059
01:04:58,828 --> 01:04:59,886
Can I get a double?

1060
01:05:16,979 --> 01:05:19,607
No, get off there. Hey, hey, girl,
what happened to you?

1061
01:05:19,682 --> 01:05:23,209
You took off. Listen, a bunch of us
are heading over to the Matador...

1062
01:05:23,286 --> 01:05:25,754
so come meet us there.
All right? Bye.

1063
01:05:28,190 --> 01:05:31,887
Pippa, it's lan.
I left the proofs on your desk.

1064
01:05:31,961 --> 01:05:33,986
They look fine.

1065
01:05:34,063 --> 01:05:37,362
I'll see you at the awards
on Saturday.

1066
01:05:37,433 --> 01:05:38,730
Bye.

1067
01:05:47,643 --> 01:05:49,668
Yo. It's me...

1068
01:05:49,745 --> 01:05:54,182
and I'm just trying
to track you down, but it's cool.

1069
01:06:07,730 --> 01:06:09,789
Hey, sweetie.
You free on Saturday?

1070
01:06:09,865 --> 01:06:12,663
Engagement brunch for Rachel.
I know you're going to love it.

1071
01:06:12,735 --> 01:06:14,669
We'll have fun, trust me.

1072
01:06:51,874 --> 01:06:54,206
Good God, you read my mind.

1073
01:06:55,277 --> 01:06:57,006
Sorry I've been hard to reach.

1074
01:06:57,079 --> 01:06:59,707
Man, you look like James Bond.

1075
01:06:59,782 --> 01:07:01,545
Hard to reach?

1076
01:07:01,617 --> 01:07:03,744
I just needed a little space.

1077
01:07:03,819 --> 01:07:05,548
Hey, baby, is that the cab?

1078
01:07:09,025 --> 01:07:10,492
I just assumed...

1079
01:07:10,559 --> 01:07:12,254
I called you.

1080
01:07:12,328 --> 01:07:14,853
Oh, my God!

1081
01:07:14,930 --> 01:07:16,522
That is so sweet!

1082
01:07:16,599 --> 01:07:19,591
You're such a doll.

1083
01:07:19,668 --> 01:07:21,260
Aren't you supposed to be
on your honeymoon?

1084
01:07:21,337 --> 01:07:24,704
Sweetie, don't worry.
I won't go public till next issue's out.

1085
01:07:24,774 --> 01:07:27,004
I mean, I don't want us all
to look stupid, right?

1086
01:07:27,076 --> 01:07:31,809
But, come on,
bankers don't send you poetry.

1087
01:07:31,881 --> 01:07:35,476
It's weird.
I mean, I feel hurt, actually.

1088
01:07:35,551 --> 01:07:38,418
And relieved,
which is a bizarre combination.

1089
01:07:38,487 --> 01:07:42,116
I don't even want him, right?
I'm single, he's single.

1090
01:07:42,191 --> 01:07:45,183
I mean, girls like us,
we rock on our own!

1091
01:07:45,261 --> 01:07:47,957
We date who we want, you know,
when we want.

1092
01:07:48,030 --> 01:07:49,691
We adopt, if we feel the need.

1093
01:07:49,765 --> 01:07:56,102
Frankly... I feel very whole.

1094
01:07:56,172 --> 01:07:59,073
But please don't make me go
to this thing by myself tonight.

1095
01:07:59,141 --> 01:08:02,474
Please go inside and put on a dress
and take an aspirin?

1096
01:08:14,256 --> 01:08:15,484
No.

1097
01:08:22,932 --> 01:08:24,695
No.

1098
01:08:26,302 --> 01:08:28,532
Honey, I'm so sorry.

1099
01:08:28,604 --> 01:08:30,731
But you work at
a birth control clinic.

1100
01:08:30,806 --> 01:08:32,774
I know! I know!

1101
01:08:32,842 --> 01:08:35,504
You're having it?

1102
01:08:35,578 --> 01:08:37,705
You and...Luke?

1103
01:08:39,348 --> 01:08:43,409
He's thrilled.
He's actually--He's thrilled!

1104
01:08:44,887 --> 01:08:48,948
Why are you apologizing?
I'm so happy for you.

1105
01:08:49,024 --> 01:08:50,787
I'm so happy for you both.

1106
01:08:50,860 --> 01:08:52,828
Hey, you guys want some tea?

1107
01:08:52,895 --> 01:08:54,954
I wish I could stay, I really do...

1108
01:08:55,030 --> 01:08:56,861
but promise me
we can celebrate later.

1109
01:08:56,932 --> 01:08:59,492
I'm so happy for you.
Congratulations!

1110
01:08:59,568 --> 01:09:02,731
- Pippa, don't!
- I want to be godmother!

1111
01:09:02,805 --> 01:09:04,432
Pippa!

1112
01:09:19,588 --> 01:09:23,456
And that's why I wanted you
to be the first to know.

1113
01:09:23,526 --> 01:09:25,619
Let's try the rouge, shall we?

1114
01:09:25,694 --> 01:09:28,094
Making the announcement next week.
We're dumping everything.

1115
01:09:28,164 --> 01:09:30,962
None of the magazines are turning profit.
Did you see that wedding magazine?

1116
01:09:31,033 --> 01:09:33,331
McGee's kid. Total dilettante.

1117
01:09:33,402 --> 01:09:35,029
Nice cover, no content.

1118
01:09:35,104 --> 01:09:36,799
You're right, Mr. Jackman.

1119
01:09:41,577 --> 01:09:44,774
Look at you, sexy thing.

1120
01:09:44,847 --> 01:09:47,315
You did good, matchmaker.

1121
01:09:47,383 --> 01:09:48,975
- Hi, Raphael.
- Hi.

1122
01:09:49,251 --> 01:09:50,946
Oh, hi, guys.

1123
01:09:51,020 --> 01:09:54,148
You remember Chad
from the Mr. Tux ad campaign?

1124
01:09:57,259 --> 01:09:58,385
Hi.

1125
01:09:58,460 --> 01:10:01,020
This is Sasha. Sasha Gray.

1126
01:10:01,096 --> 01:10:02,495
Sasha!

1127
01:10:02,565 --> 01:10:05,033
Oh, my God, that's so weird.
You guys have the same last name.

1128
01:10:05,801 --> 01:10:10,465
Guys, this is so exciting!

1129
01:10:10,539 --> 01:10:12,439
How you doing, folks?
Good evening.

1130
01:10:12,508 --> 01:10:14,999
Everybody looks great.

1131
01:10:15,077 --> 01:10:16,442
Hello, Mr. Jones.

1132
01:10:16,512 --> 01:10:19,276
Up next is the award for design.

1133
01:10:19,348 --> 01:10:22,317
Many of you who know me
know I went to school for design...

1134
01:10:22,384 --> 01:10:24,579
at L'cole de Photo.

1135
01:10:24,653 --> 01:10:28,612
And, well, not nominated,
but it's all very political.

1136
01:10:28,691 --> 01:10:30,886
So, you're a doctor, huh?

1137
01:10:30,960 --> 01:10:33,360
I really respect people
who give back.

1138
01:10:33,429 --> 01:10:35,727
Oh, yeah. Me, too.

1139
01:10:35,798 --> 01:10:38,995
Coming up next, the awards
for photography and graphic design.

1140
01:10:39,068 --> 01:10:41,468
- OK. Y'all cross your fingers.
- First, a very special moment.

1141
01:10:41,537 --> 01:10:42,868
Where's Roxanne?

1142
01:10:42,938 --> 01:10:44,530
The Lifetime Achievement award.

1143
01:10:44,607 --> 01:10:46,472
Roxanne, our award's coming up.

1144
01:10:46,542 --> 01:10:49,875
...is a publisher with over
10 magazines in his repertoire...

1145
01:10:49,945 --> 01:10:53,005
I got it.
Dropped my napkin.

1146
01:10:53,082 --> 01:10:54,743
I think I'm gonna be sick.

1147
01:10:54,817 --> 01:10:58,412
Tougher than nails
and wiser than Solomon...

1148
01:10:58,487 --> 01:11:01,945
Mr. Malcolm McGee.

1149
01:11:04,593 --> 01:11:08,324
Christ, he's not here.
I guess I should get it for him?

1150
01:11:08,397 --> 01:11:09,694
Yes, go!

1151
01:11:09,765 --> 01:11:11,858
Yeah, go.

1152
01:11:11,934 --> 01:11:13,868
Unfortunately,
Malcolm can't be with us tonight.

1153
01:11:13,936 --> 01:11:17,838
But he's asked that his colleague
and vice president, lan Gray...

1154
01:11:17,906 --> 01:11:19,840
accept the award on his behalf.

1155
01:11:29,351 --> 01:11:31,080
Wait. Pippa, don't go.

1156
01:11:38,627 --> 01:11:39,958
Pippa.

1157
01:11:42,398 --> 01:11:43,922
Pippa, I'm sorry. I had no--

1158
01:11:43,999 --> 01:11:45,057
It's fine.

1159
01:11:45,134 --> 01:11:46,795
It's not fine. All right?

1160
01:11:46,869 --> 01:11:49,269
It's not fair, it's not fine.

1161
01:11:52,741 --> 01:11:54,402
Come on.
At least let me drive you home.

1162
01:11:54,476 --> 01:11:56,410
I'm not going home.

1163
01:11:56,478 --> 01:11:59,914
Keep on running, huh?
Don't you ever get tired?

1164
01:11:59,982 --> 01:12:02,212
It's called living, lan.
I wouldn't exactly say you're an expert.

1165
01:12:02,284 --> 01:12:05,117
Living what?
Bungee jumping off some cliff?

1166
01:12:05,187 --> 01:12:08,486
Running around with some random guy
who's not worth a moment of your time?

1167
01:12:08,557 --> 01:12:10,855
- You don't even know me.
- Bullshit!

1168
01:12:10,926 --> 01:12:12,723
I know that
you don't talk to your father.

1169
01:12:12,795 --> 01:12:15,195
I know that you miss your mother.

1170
01:12:15,264 --> 01:12:16,822
I know what you look like
when you kiss.

1171
01:12:16,899 --> 01:12:20,995
And I know that you have never, ever
dated someone that matters to you.

1172
01:12:21,070 --> 01:12:23,163
You think you matter to me?

1173
01:12:23,238 --> 01:12:24,398
Hey, hey. Don't do this.

1174
01:12:24,473 --> 01:12:27,271
Why not?
I heard you talking to Jackman.

1175
01:12:27,343 --> 01:12:29,937
Selling out my dad behind his back...

1176
01:12:30,012 --> 01:12:33,209
telling me I could make it work,
but then assuming that I'm gonna fail.

1177
01:12:33,282 --> 01:12:37,844
Well, congratulations, it worked.
But what do you have left?

1178
01:12:37,920 --> 01:12:39,945
Some ex-wife that
you can't seem to break up with?

1179
01:12:40,022 --> 01:12:42,786
The dream of some sailboat
that you put in storage?

1180
01:12:42,858 --> 01:12:45,383
Accepting awards
for other people's vision?

1181
01:12:45,461 --> 01:12:48,624
That's not living. That's pathetic.

1182
01:13:01,510 --> 01:13:03,239
Lifetime Achievement award.

1183
01:13:04,480 --> 01:13:06,175
That's barely worth mentioning.

1184
01:13:06,248 --> 01:13:09,274
Must not be important if you got
lan Gray to accept it for you.

1185
01:13:09,351 --> 01:13:12,252
Well, I've worked with lan for years.
I'm his mentor.

1186
01:13:12,321 --> 01:13:16,280
And I'm your daughter.
Doesn't really count for much, does it?

1187
01:13:16,358 --> 01:13:19,623
I didn't matter to you as a kid,
I didn't matter to you as a teenager.

1188
01:13:19,695 --> 01:13:21,560
And by the way, Philippa,
your mom died last night.

1189
01:13:21,630 --> 01:13:23,222
You're too busy to let me know.

1190
01:13:23,298 --> 01:13:24,822
Look...

1191
01:13:24,900 --> 01:13:27,027
I wanted to tell you in person.

1192
01:13:27,102 --> 01:13:28,467
Well, I'm here now.

1193
01:13:28,537 --> 01:13:32,871
I'm living with you in this museum.

1194
01:13:32,941 --> 01:13:36,809
I'm 29 years old,
and I'm putting my life on hold...

1195
01:13:36,879 --> 01:13:39,848
trying to make you proud of me.

1196
01:13:39,915 --> 01:13:41,246
What a waste.

1197
01:13:43,385 --> 01:13:46,479
You know, lan's working
with Jackman behind your back.

1198
01:13:46,555 --> 01:13:49,490
He's negotiating
the inevitable takeover.

1199
01:13:49,558 --> 01:13:50,820
It's practically Oedipal.

1200
01:13:50,893 --> 01:13:53,919
Wait a minute.
It's not behind my back.

1201
01:13:53,996 --> 01:13:55,623
What?

1202
01:13:55,697 --> 01:13:59,360
It's not a takeover. I'm selling.

1203
01:13:59,435 --> 01:14:01,960
And I asked lan to handle it for me.

1204
01:14:05,174 --> 01:14:06,732
You got lan to do it for you?

1205
01:14:08,744 --> 01:14:11,042
Did you ever think of
letting me know, Dad?

1206
01:14:16,452 --> 01:14:18,852
Well, I hope you put that award
on your mantelpiece...

1207
01:14:18,921 --> 01:14:22,084
and I hope you shine it
and look at it every day.

1208
01:14:22,157 --> 01:14:24,352
Because it's all you got left.

1209
01:14:32,701 --> 01:14:33,690
So where was l?

1210
01:14:33,769 --> 01:14:35,862
You were on the part about
you being a thoughtless piece of shit.

1211
01:14:35,938 --> 01:14:37,235
- Right. Thank you.
- Anytime.

1212
01:14:37,306 --> 01:14:38,967
All right. So then I say...

1213
01:14:39,041 --> 01:14:41,339
"Obviously my inability
to communicate with my father...

1214
01:14:41,410 --> 01:14:42,934
"has affected both
my professional judgment...

1215
01:14:43,011 --> 01:14:44,171
"and my personal behavior."

1216
01:14:44,246 --> 01:14:46,544
Run-on sentence.

1217
01:14:46,615 --> 01:14:48,606
"And therefore I have decided
to remove myself...

1218
01:14:48,684 --> 01:14:50,447
"from the editorial masthead
before I do any more damage."

1219
01:14:50,519 --> 01:14:52,487
You can't start a sentence with "And."

1220
01:14:52,554 --> 01:14:55,284
Look, could you just nod?
Or smile?

1221
01:14:55,357 --> 01:14:58,053
Lady, you're writing
a letter of resignation...

1222
01:14:58,126 --> 01:15:00,959
to a guy you're clearly hot for.

1223
01:15:01,029 --> 01:15:03,293
Look, this guy would not touch me
with a 10-foot pole.

1224
01:15:03,365 --> 01:15:05,663
You're sure?
I mean, if he's the one.

1225
01:15:05,734 --> 01:15:07,224
Even if he was someone--

1226
01:15:07,302 --> 01:15:09,566
Someone, the one,
same damn thing.

1227
01:15:09,638 --> 01:15:12,505
Listen. Get out of here, OK?

1228
01:15:12,574 --> 01:15:15,737
Go show this guy with the 10-foot pole
that you mean business.

1229
01:15:15,811 --> 01:15:18,041
Your grammar sucks,
but you're creative.

1230
01:15:18,113 --> 01:15:19,705
Figure it out.

1231
01:15:28,490 --> 01:15:29,684
Ian?

1232
01:15:35,731 --> 01:15:36,755
Ian?

1233
01:16:10,532 --> 01:16:11,931
Ian?

1234
01:16:38,827 --> 01:16:40,089
Ian, it's me.

1235
01:16:40,162 --> 01:16:42,596
I don't know how to say I'm sorry...

1236
01:16:42,664 --> 01:16:46,896
but I'm gonna try. OK.

1237
01:16:49,037 --> 01:16:50,971
Philippa.

1238
01:16:51,039 --> 01:16:52,301
Jesus, Dad.

1239
01:16:52,374 --> 01:16:53,807
You're fired.

1240
01:16:55,110 --> 01:16:56,441
What?

1241
01:16:56,511 --> 01:16:58,138
You don't want to do this.

1242
01:16:58,213 --> 01:17:04,015
You don't want to run a wedding magazine
for a company that is falling apart.

1243
01:17:04,086 --> 01:17:06,316
I don't understand.

1244
01:17:06,388 --> 01:17:09,789
Of course you don't,
because I didn't tell you.

1245
01:17:09,858 --> 01:17:13,589
How do I say to my daughter
that I'm tired?

1246
01:17:13,662 --> 01:17:17,723
And that I have spent 35 years
building a company...

1247
01:17:17,799 --> 01:17:20,768
neglecting your mother,
neglecting you...

1248
01:17:20,836 --> 01:17:22,827
and that I'm just going to let it go?

1249
01:17:24,706 --> 01:17:26,833
Without a fight.

1250
01:17:26,908 --> 01:17:30,469
And, of course, instead of
asking you to forgive me...

1251
01:17:30,545 --> 01:17:32,240
I kept you in the dark.

1252
01:17:33,382 --> 01:17:35,350
Why?

1253
01:17:37,519 --> 01:17:40,579
I don't know how to tell you things.

1254
01:17:41,623 --> 01:17:43,488
I've been so hard on you.

1255
01:17:45,494 --> 01:17:46,586
Dad, it's OK.

1256
01:17:46,662 --> 01:17:48,459
It's not OK.

1257
01:17:50,866 --> 01:17:54,199
Life's so short.

1258
01:17:54,269 --> 01:17:57,932
And you are so...

1259
01:17:58,006 --> 01:17:59,940
remarkable.

1260
01:18:01,043 --> 01:18:04,911
So, Pippa, please, get out.

1261
01:18:04,980 --> 01:18:06,538
Get out of here.

1262
01:18:06,615 --> 01:18:09,379
Find something that you love.

1263
01:18:09,451 --> 01:18:12,284
You called me Pippa.

1264
01:18:17,893 --> 01:18:19,952
I'm turning it all over tomorrow.

1265
01:18:23,165 --> 01:18:25,133
So that's it? It's over?

1266
01:18:25,200 --> 01:18:28,465
Oh, I'll stay on as chair for,
you know, a few months...

1267
01:18:28,537 --> 01:18:30,528
during the transition.

1268
01:18:37,145 --> 01:18:39,170
Dad, I want the last issue.

1269
01:18:40,615 --> 01:18:42,014
You sure?

1270
01:18:43,452 --> 01:18:45,443
It's what I really want.

1271
01:19:04,539 --> 01:19:08,236
Lulu, if we make a donation to your clinic,
will you design a dress for the cover?

1272
01:19:08,310 --> 01:19:09,800
I don't know how to design a dress.

1273
01:19:09,878 --> 01:19:11,311
Yeah. You're a visual person.

1274
01:19:11,379 --> 01:19:13,609
You know, the big white dress
you're always talking about.

1275
01:19:13,682 --> 01:19:15,240
Though, frankly, I'm thinking pink.

1276
01:19:15,317 --> 01:19:17,251
Really? Anything I want?

1277
01:19:17,319 --> 01:19:18,581
Pippa!

1278
01:19:18,653 --> 01:19:21,178
I've got five couples
for your gay marriage story.

1279
01:19:21,256 --> 01:19:24,054
It is your gay marriage story,
assuming you're willing to write it.

1280
01:19:24,126 --> 01:19:25,184
Oh, wicked!

1281
01:19:25,260 --> 01:19:27,888
OK, Lee, design whatever you want.
Go crazy. Surprise me.

1282
01:19:27,963 --> 01:19:30,056
Great! Guys, guess what?

1283
01:19:30,132 --> 01:19:33,067
John lrving said yes. He'll write
a piece on marriage in two days.

1284
01:19:33,135 --> 01:19:35,933
If I manage his stocks for a year.
Just call me The Rainmaker.

1285
01:19:36,004 --> 01:19:39,235
Oh, my God!
I love you, guys, man!

1286
01:19:39,307 --> 01:19:40,365
I don't know how to do this.

1287
01:19:40,442 --> 01:19:41,500
Yes, you do.

1288
01:19:41,576 --> 01:19:42,804
Dear Wedding Bells...

1289
01:19:42,878 --> 01:19:44,812
my friends tell me
that I have Peter Pan syndrome...

1290
01:19:44,880 --> 01:19:46,609
that I'm afraid to grow up.

1291
01:19:46,681 --> 01:19:49,013
Will committing to someone I love
make this better or worse?

1292
01:19:49,084 --> 01:19:51,348
Signed, 29 Forever.

1293
01:19:51,419 --> 01:19:53,887
Wait a second.
Does lan know about all of this?

1294
01:19:53,955 --> 01:19:56,480
No, it's a surprise.
Kind of like you under the table...

1295
01:19:56,558 --> 01:19:57,923
at the awards was a surprise.

1296
01:19:59,628 --> 01:20:03,223
Dear 29 Forever...

1297
01:20:03,398 --> 01:20:06,959
"Dear Readers,
birds do it, bees do it.

1298

01:20:12,107 --> 01:20:14,803

1318
01:21:03,558 --> 01:21:05,025
- What are you guys doing?
- Free champagne?

1319
01:21:05,093 --> 01:21:07,220
- I look gorgeous.
- I'll be on your next cover.

1320
01:21:07,295 --> 01:21:09,286
Oh, sweetie, congratulations.
I'm so proud of you.

1321
01:21:09,364 --> 01:21:10,888
- Ms. McGee!
- Congratulations.

1322
01:21:10,966 --> 01:21:15,426
It would be so easy to hate you,
but it's selling off the goddamn shelves.

1323
01:21:15,503 --> 01:21:17,368
Oh, my God, it's amazing!
They've got interviews--

1324
01:21:17,439 --> 01:21:18,929
I've got fans.

"Roxanne Perdue's column
Tough Love is a refreshing delight."

1326

Pippa. Hey.

1327
01:21:26,514 --> 01:21:28,778
Congratulations.

1328
01:21:28,850 --> 01:21:33,412
I wanted to come by.

1329
01:21:33,488 --> 01:21:34,955
How's Sydney?

1330
01:21:36,057 --> 01:21:38,958
Well, that's the thing.

1331
01:21:39,027 --> 01:21:40,392
She's a nice girl.

1332
01:21:40,462 --> 01:21:42,930
She's crazy.

1333
01:21:42,998 --> 01:21:45,296
She's fun.
She might make you happy.

1334
01:21:45,367 --> 01:21:46,493
You think?

1335
01:21:46,568 --> 01:21:48,798
It's worth a try.

1336
01:21:58,179 --> 01:22:00,272
All righty.
Oh, we've got interviews.

1337
01:22:00,348 --> 01:22:01,872
- Actually, you guys, I gotta go.
- What are you doing?

1338
01:22:01,950 --> 01:22:04,544
It's kind of about a guy.

1339
01:22:04,619 --> 01:22:07,816
- Oh, my God. Oh.
- Oh, no, no, no. Heaven can wait.

1340
01:22:07,889 --> 01:22:09,356
Oh, no, it can't.

1341
01:22:09,424 --> 01:22:11,392
Pippa! Wait!

1342
01:22:11,459 --> 01:22:13,324
Wait up for me!

1343
01:22:17,866 --> 01:22:18,890
Wait. Where are we going?

1344
01:22:18,967 --> 01:22:20,195
An antique store.

1345
01:22:20,268 --> 01:22:21,565
It's a long story.

1346
01:22:21,636 --> 01:22:22,898
I've come about a bed.

1347
01:22:22,971 --> 01:22:24,131
Single, double, iron?

1348
01:22:24,205 --> 01:22:25,263
- Pine.
- Double.

1349
01:22:25,340 --> 01:22:27,740
It's got like these spindly things.
It's got a very firm mattress.

1350
01:22:27,809 --> 01:22:29,709
It's for a guy.
It's for a very specific guy.

1351
01:22:29,778 --> 01:22:32,542
- It's a present.
- I'll give you a free ad in Wedding Bells.

1352
01:22:32,614 --> 01:22:33,638
What? Frank!

1353
01:22:33,715 --> 01:22:34,704
Sold it.

1354
01:22:36,318 --> 01:22:38,047
Go, Pip! Go, Pip!

1355
01:22:40,021 --> 01:22:41,181
I can't do it.

1356
01:22:41,256 --> 01:22:43,121
- Go on!
- Go get him!

1357
01:22:43,191 --> 01:22:45,557
Get that man! Get him!

1358
01:23:05,747 --> 01:23:09,808
Forget him. You're young.
You're cute. You'll be fine.

1359
01:23:09,884 --> 01:23:11,681
Call me when you hit 40.

1360
01:23:11,753 --> 01:23:12,947
I'm almost 40.

1361
01:23:13,021 --> 01:23:14,989
You're 29. Boo fucking hoo.

1362
01:23:15,056 --> 01:23:17,320
It gets worse.
Just with better clothes.

1363
01:23:17,392 --> 01:23:19,417
Roxanne, I still think
that she should talk to him.

1364
01:23:19,494 --> 01:23:20,552
He's fine. He's good.

1365
01:23:20,628 --> 01:23:24,621
He's with a very nice woman
who saves lives.

1366
01:23:24,699 --> 01:23:27,293
Hello. Cirque du Soleil here.

1367
01:23:27,369 --> 01:23:29,997
I talked to Jackman.
They're keeping the magazine.

1368
01:23:30,071 --> 01:23:31,265
Are you serious?

1369
01:23:31,339 --> 01:23:33,273
So, what are you going to do?

1370
01:23:33,341 --> 01:23:34,831
I quit. Gonna write a book.

1371
01:23:34,909 --> 01:23:37,537
Adventure Travel
for the Single Woman.

1372
01:23:42,784 --> 01:23:44,649
I don't want a new boss.

1373
01:23:44,719 --> 01:23:46,118
Well, Roxanne's gonna be
an excellent editor.

1374
01:23:46,187 --> 01:23:48,985
I mean, she's smart, she's fair.
She knows the business.

1375
01:23:49,057 --> 01:23:50,649
Pippa.

1376
01:23:52,360 --> 01:23:53,793
Hey, I was sipping.

1377
01:23:53,862 --> 01:23:56,194
Shut it, lady.
You got fruit in your womb.

1378
01:23:56,264 --> 01:23:58,494
Pippa, I really still think
you should talk to him.

1379
01:24:00,335 --> 01:24:02,633
Oh, sweetie.

1380
01:24:03,805 --> 01:24:05,602
He's gonna call you.

1381
01:24:05,673 --> 01:24:08,198
I don't know.

1382
01:24:08,276 --> 01:24:11,074
Sweetie, it's OK.

1383
01:24:11,146 --> 01:24:12,943
No.

1384
01:24:13,014 --> 01:24:14,413
You know what?

1385
01:24:14,482 --> 01:24:16,313
I'm fine.

1386
01:25:44,973 --> 01:25:46,873
Oh, my God.

1387
01:25:48,109 --> 01:25:49,940
I read your editorial.

1388
01:25:50,011 --> 01:25:52,605
The whole magazine--it's amazing.

1389
01:25:52,680 --> 01:25:54,272
I hear they're saving it.

1390
01:25:54,349 --> 01:25:57,375
So you went sailing?

1391
01:25:57,452 --> 01:25:59,215
Your dad said you were at the lake.

1392
01:25:59,287 --> 01:26:01,983
Thought I'd give it a try.

1393
01:26:15,537 --> 01:26:17,334
That bed was sold.

1394
01:26:17,405 --> 01:26:20,841
Yeah. To me, for you.

1395
01:26:24,045 --> 01:26:27,378
Pippa, it didn't work with her
the first time.

1396
01:26:27,448 --> 01:26:29,882
And I'm in love with somebody else.

1397
01:26:31,252 --> 01:26:32,879
So, are you on the rebound?

1398
01:26:32,954 --> 01:26:35,889
I don't know if I can compete with
some superhero surgeon person.

1399
01:26:35,957 --> 01:26:38,790
What? You don't listen, do you?

1400
01:26:38,860 --> 01:26:41,158
Ever.

1401
01:26:41,229 --> 01:26:42,321
I'm just sayin'.

1402
01:26:42,397 --> 01:26:43,921
It's OK. Forget it.

1403
01:26:43,998 --> 01:26:46,558
I mean, I sailed all this way,
but whatever.

1404
01:26:46,634 --> 01:26:48,568
- Don't leave.
- Can't hear you.

1405
01:26:48,636 --> 01:26:51,799
Please. Don't leave.

1406
01:26:53,408 --> 01:26:54,670
Hey.

1407
01:26:55,777 --> 01:26:57,108
I like you, too.

1408
01:27:00,315 --> 01:27:01,373
Finally.

1409
01:27:42,824 --> 01:27:45,224
You're still here.

1410
01:28:27,535 --> 01:28:30,936
I'd like to finish by saying
my darling, darling Lulu has moved...

1411
01:28:31,005 --> 01:28:33,166
from the hurly-burly
of the chaise lounge...

1412
01:28:33,241 --> 01:28:35,539
to the deep, deep peace
of the double bed.

1413
01:28:35,610 --> 01:28:37,510
And l, for one, drink to that.

1414
01:28:37,578 --> 01:28:38,875
- Cheers!
- Thank you.

1415
01:28:41,449 --> 01:28:42,882
To Luke and Lulu.

1416
01:28:42,950 --> 01:28:45,043
To Luke and Lulu!

1417
01:28:46,487 --> 01:28:52,255
It's a dark chocolate Callebaut truffle
fondant and butter cream frosting.

1418
01:28:56,564 --> 01:28:59,931
When I threw it, if you just get at it
with a 45-degree angle right here.

1419
01:29:00,001 --> 01:29:01,866
OK, guys. Ready?

1420
01:29:01,936 --> 01:29:04,496
One, two, three.

1421
01:29:06,174 --> 01:29:08,642
Jane, you're already married.
Give it to Rachel.

1422
01:29:08,710 --> 01:29:10,041
I know. I'm just making sure
she got it.

1423
01:29:10,111 --> 01:29:11,669
Thank you. Thank you.

1424
01:29:11,746 --> 01:29:13,509
Yay, Rachel!

1425
01:29:33,134 --> 01:29:34,396
I love weddings.
