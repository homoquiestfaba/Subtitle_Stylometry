1
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:33,700
Hello.

2
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:35,400
Good morning, Doug.

3
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:37,600
I missed you.

4
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:40,700
Who is this?

5
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,700
Come on. I know you know me.

6
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:46,100
Refresh my memory.

7
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:47,800
What did we do?

8
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:49,600
Don't be naughty.

9
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:51,800
Not yet.

10
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:55,100
We met at the ceremony where
they retired your number.

11
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:57,500
I was the brunette by the bar.

12
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:02,100
I'll cry if you don't remember me.

13
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:04,800
Or what I said I'd do.

14
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:06,100
Right.

15
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:07,400
Brunette.

16
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:08,700
Big blue eyes.

17
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:11,300
Touchdown, quarterback.

18
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:13,300
let me ask you something.

19
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:15,000
Are you still with your wife?

20
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,900
Oh, she's out. Pilates or
something-- forget about her.

21
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,300
Okay.

22
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:24,600
So, what was your most
exciting experience?

23
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:28,800
Winning your first, second or third ring?

24
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:33,300
What if I said my most exciting
experience was talking to you, honey?

25
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:36,500
now you're just being bad.

26
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:42,600
Okay, after the birth of my
daughter, I'd have to say my induction.

27
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,800
I remember your speech.

28
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:47,200
You were on crutches, right?

29
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,100
That's right.

30
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:50,700
Fourth surgery on my right knee.

31
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:54,000
It starts like an S.O.B. when it rains.

32
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,200
You follow football?

33
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,900
Always been a fan.

34
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:59,500
You can blame my dad for that.

35
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:05,000
You know, I read recently
that you were hospitalized.

36
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,300
Was it anything serious?

37
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:14,700
Okay... now you're starting
to sound like a reporter.

38
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:17,300
Are you writing a story or something?

39
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,800
Or something.

40
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,600
How would you like... to be remembered?

41
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,600
Doug?

42
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,400
Are you okay?

43
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:33,900
Is everything all right?

44
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,300
Doug?

45
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,700
Doug?

46
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,400
Hello?

47
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,900
Doug?

48
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Are you still there?

49
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,700
Hello?

50
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:49,000
Doug?

51
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:58,700
Hey, H.

52
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:01,900
Detective.

53
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:02,900
What have you got?

54
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:05,200
The victim is Doug Mcclain.

55
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,900
The football player.

56
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:10,000
Who called it in?

57
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,300
The wife.

58
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:14,200
Said she got back from Augustine
and found him on the floor.

59
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:16,500
Although he retired 12
years ago, he's still a star,

60
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,700
so when this breaks,
it's gonna break big.

61
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,700
Do we have control of
the media, detective?

62
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:25,000
Oh, as good as can be expected,
given the circumstances.

63
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,100
- The body's in here.
- okay

64
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:30,000
He's got a stab wound through the neck.

65
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:32,200
Have we located the murder weapon yet?

66
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,100
Did a cursory.

67
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:35,200
Didn't see anything, but...

68
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:37,300
we got this.

69
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,200
Okay.

70
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,200
Check his phone records.

71
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:42,300
Maybe he was attempting
to call for help.

72
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,800
- Already working on it.
- Thank you.

73
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:45,100
Alexx?

74
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:49,600
Whoever stabbed him
perfectly severed his carotid.

75
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,100
This spray...

76
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:55,200
is from his last three heartbeats.

77
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:04,000
Only get that kind of force and volume
with a total arterial transection.

78
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,500
Alexx, I don't see any defensive wounds.

79
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:10,600
It doesn't make sense.

80
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:14,400
Doug Mcclain was one of the
best athletes of his time.

81
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:17,800
A man like this would never
go down without a fight.

82
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:19,500
Till today.

83
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:24,400
okay. That doesn't look good.

84
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,700
What's going on?

85
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:29,400
The victim's wife and that
character want the body.

86
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:30,900
For what?

87
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:32,700
Cryonics.

88
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,700
They want to freeze him?

89
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,100
That's what they said.

90
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:45,000
Excuse me.

91
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,600
Mrs. Mcclain?

92
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:49,100
I'm Alexx Woods, M.E.

93
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:51,400
I'm sorry for your loss.

94
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:53,100
Thank you.

95
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:56,400
But I can't let you
take your husband's body.

96
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:00,300
But it was Doug's wish to be frozen
until he could be cryonically revived.

97
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:03,500
He made all of the arrangements
with the cryonic facility and...

98
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,600
and dr. Klein...

99
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:05,300
yes.

100
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:09,900
I understand, but that was
before he died a vioeant dleth.

101
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:14,100
An autopsy could seriously
compromise Doug's chances of revival.

102
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:18,500
With all due respect, doctor,
fame doesn't exempt him.

103
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:21,400
I have jurisdiction over
the remains of his body.

104
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:23,600
Here. Does this help?

105
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:27,200
It's an injunction from judge Porterson.

106
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:31,300
An autopsy will never bring
back Doug, but some day...

107
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:34,200
science will.

108
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:39,900
I have an eight- year-old daughter, and
I know it sounds crazy, but...

109
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:43,500
Doug wanted to see her grow up.

110
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:47,200
This way, maybe...

111
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:49,400
one day he  will see her.

112
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,300
And maybe even her children.

113
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:52,900
We'll just take the body.

114
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,800
Okay, this is subject
to court ajudication.

115
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:58,600
In the meantime, you better
find me a seat in your van,

116
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:02,000
because that body does
not leave my sight.

117
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,200
Certainly.

118
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:04,700
Mcclain was inducted into the
hall of fame just last year.

119
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:09,300
Famed football quarterback Doug Mcclain was
found murdered in his home early this morning.

120
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:11,800
He broke records in 1988
for total yards thrown.

121
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:14,100
Doug's wife, Elissa, was
not available for comment.

122
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:18,400
Stay tuned to channel four
news, as we continue to bring you...

123
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,900
that's heparin, isn't it?

124
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:22,200
Yes.

125
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:26,800
You do realize an anti-coagulant
is elusess on the dead, right?

126
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:28,200
Dead to you, doctor.

127
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:30,200
We operate with a different definition.

128
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:33,600
Heparin helps maintain tissue viability.

129
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:39,200
Okay. Get him in.

130
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:49,800
You find anything, csi Duquesne?

131
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:53,100
Only smudges, detective berkeley.

132
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:55,400
I didn't hear you leave this morning.

133
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:59,000
Well, you know, a girl's
got to keep some mystery.

134
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:00,200
Okay.

135
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:02,500
Well, what do you got on this one?

136
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:07,000
Well, I can tell you there was no forced
entry and this window was the only thing open.

137
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:09,400
Well, it might be how the killer got in.

138
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
This doesn't belong.

139
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:14,200
What is it?

140
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:17,200
It's a piece of double-sided
tape, but look at the fibers in it.

141
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,800
It's too short to be carpet.

142
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:21,200
I bet it was pulled off of
whoever came through the window.

143
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:22,900
You find anything?

144
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:23,900
Oh, yeah.

145
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:26,800
Just... probable motive.

146
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:47,500
Somebody took Mcclain's
three championship rings.

147
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:48,900
"1995 championship ball."

148
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:51,500
I'm assuming there used
to be a football there.

149
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:54,000
It would have been from his last game.

150
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:59,200
Took his team into the championship
one last time and then retired.

151
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:01,300
The man was a class act.

152
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:02,900
You know, I knew that you liked football,

153
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:06,100
but I wasn't aware that
you were so into it.

154
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:10,000
Well, you need your mornings, I
need my sunday afternoons.

155
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,900
So you really think that Mcclain
was killed for a few keepsakes?

156
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:15,100
Keepsakes?

157
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,800
The stuff in this room's
got to be worth a fortune.

158
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:20,200
Well, then, why not take it all?

159
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:24,500
Three championship rings and a signed
team ball is definitely worth the most.

160
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:28,100
Then I think the killer
definitely knew what he was doing.

161
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,300
You gonna be able to
pull any prints off that?

162
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,300
It's worth a try.

163
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:37,000
Alexx, what do you got?

164
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,700
Doug Mcclain's wife presented
a signed court order, Horatio.

165
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:42,000
Signed by who?

166
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:47,600
Judge Porterson, miami's leading
advocate of progresvesi science.

167
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,300
You mean leading advocate
of science fiction.

168
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:52,100
It's gonna take a hearing before
I can get Doug under my knife.

169
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:53,400
By then, we could lose everything.

170
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:54,300
Okay, here's what we do.

171
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:55,600
Shift to plan "B."

172
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,800
I'm on my way to precore now.

173
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:58,700
I'll let you know.

174
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:00,300
Keep me posted.

175
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:10,500
Hey, d g youidet a chance to look over the
things I brought in from the trophy case?

176
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:13,600
Yeah. I got a print
on that pair of cleats.

177
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:20,600
But it doesn't match Doug Mcclain or
his wife, and afis doesn't recognize it.

178
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:22,500
Well, nothing comes easy, doeshat?

179
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:23,500
W it's that?

180
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:26,400
You were right about the sticky
tape you found by the window.

181
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:29,100
The fibers don't match
anything in Mcclain's house.

182
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:30,600
It's silk.

183
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:32,000
Italian silk.

184
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Killer could have brought
it in on his clothing.

185
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:36,200
Yeah. Unfortunately, a
lot of people wear it.

186
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:38,300
Well, you got anything better?

187
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:39,000
No.

188
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:40,900
But Mcclain was on the phone
at the time of the murder,

189
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:43,900
so Tripp is running the records
to see who he was talking to.

190
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,100
You think he has somebody?

191
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:48,000
Yeah. Her name is Wendy Legassic.

192
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:52,500
Wendy Legassic, I'm Calleigh Duquesne.

193
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,700
Hi.

194
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,300
That's a pretty top.

195
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:56,800
Is it silk?

196
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:58,100
Yeah.

197
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:01,000
We're going to have to take a
sample of your top to compare to

198
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:04,000
some fibers we found at the
Doug Mcclain crime scene.

199
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,700
What makes you think I
was at the crime scene?

200
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:06,800
According to the phone records,

201
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,800
you were the last person to speak
to Doug Mcclain before he was killed.

202
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:13,000
The closest I got to him was the phone.

203
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:16,100
I was just updating his obituary.

204
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,500
I'm sorry?

205
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:22,100
Newspapers like to be prepared
for an unexpected death.

206
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:28,000
We have obituaries of people still alive on
file so when they pass, we're ready to print.

207
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,700
That is morbid.

208
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:32,000
So I take it that you're a reporter?

209
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:36,200
My boss gave me a list of names
and told me to update them.

210
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:38,500
And people will just talk to you?

211
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:41,100
You figure out ways
to get them to open up.

212
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:42,900
Doug was a jock.

213
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:45,300
It's pretty obvious what part
of the ego you have to stroke.

214
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:48,000
I was the brunette by the bar.

215
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:52,600
I'll cry if you don't remember me.

216
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:56,200
That's the list of people
that I had to update.

217
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,900
See? Doug Mcclain?

218
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,900
Fidel castro, dick cheney...

219
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:02,300
I don't understand why Doug
would be at the top the list.

220
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:04,600
He doesn't have near the medical
history of these other people.

221
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:08,900
My boss says that retired football
players have a high mortality rate.

222
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:10,900
Something about the
abuse to their bodies.

223
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,400
And the abuse got a whole lot
worse during the phone call.

224
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,200
Am I right?

225
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:17,300
What are you accusing me of?

226
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:19,500
It just seems to be an
incredible coincidence that

227
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:22,800
Doug Mcclain would be killed on the
same day you were updating his obituary.

228
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:26,200
That doesn't mean I had
anything to do with it.

229
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:28,100
Are you sure?

230
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,500
You didn't keep Doug on the phone

231
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,500
so that someone would have
opportunity to kill him?

232
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:33,800
Why would I do that?

233
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:35,400
I don't know.

234
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:38,000
But I'm going to find out.

235
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,500
Have you prepped the equipment, doctor?

236
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:44,400
Yes.

237
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:46,100
What are you using it for?

238
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:50,200
Well, if I can't perform a traditional
autopsy to figure out what happened to him,

239
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:52,600
I'm going to conduct a virtopsy.

240
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:54,200
As long as you do it quickly.

241
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:56,700
We need to get him into a neuropod asap.

242
00:12:56,700 --> 00:13:00,000
I have to warn you, it's
going to be freezing in there.

243
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:18,100
Yes.

244
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:20,100
Horatio. Yes.

245
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:23,100
I'm working on our quarterback now.

246
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:26,500
Right. Right. But this will
take longer than the real thing.

247
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:31,800
I have to compile each scan until I get
a fully-rendered model of the knife wound.

248
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:33,600
I understand, Alexx. What else?

249
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:37,800
According to early data, he does
have a fracture on his hand.

250
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:41,600
Looks like to the second metacarpal, with
swelling around the wrist.

251
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,000
Swelling around the wrist?

252
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,700
Perhaps he punched
someone or something, huh?

253
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:46,400
Yeah.

254
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:48,400
Looks like he may have
fought back after all.

255
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:51,100
Maybe. Keep me posted.

256
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:02,300
Hey.

257
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:05,500
Hey. You hear anything from
Calleigh about the obit writer?

258
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:06,500
Wendy?

259
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:08,300
Calleigh couldn't
place her at the scene.

260
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:10,100
All right. I guess we keep digging, huh?

261
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:10,900
What have you got?

262
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,700
Well, I'm trying to track down Doug Mcclain's
stolen memorabilia off the internet.

263
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,800
How many sites have you been to?

264
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,800
14... so far.

265
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:21,000
you know how many sites there are, right?

266
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:22,900
Yeah.

267
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:25,900
wait a minute. Go back.

268
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:28,300
There's some football stuff there.

269
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:31,900
Championship rings.

270
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:33,300
That them?

271
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:34,700
Looks like it.

272
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:38,400
Championship years '92, '93 and '95.

273
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:40,700
Yeah. And there's the
football right there.

274
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:42,900
Oh, ye of little faith.

275
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,900
All of these items were put up
for auction by a Theo Knight.

276
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:49,300
Well, Theo's about to get a very
disappointing return on his investment.

277
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:51,100
Let me call Horatio.

278
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:06,000
Why do you guys need my prints?

279
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,900
We have reason to believe
that Doug Mcclain was killed

280
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:10,300
during a robbery of his
football memorabilia.

281
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:12,100
You seem like quite a fan, Theo.

282
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:14,400
My dad lived and died by Doug Mcclain.

283
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:17,000
Every snap. Every pass.

284
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:21,900
What, you guys think I broke into his house
to steal from his personal collection?

285
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,200
We don't know.

286
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:25,800
We found a fingerprint, though, on
an old cleat of his.

287
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,900
Is that going to match one of these?

288
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:30,900
It may.

289
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:34,600
I was there two weeks
ago, but not last night.

290
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:36,800
I bought this stuff. I spent a fortune.

291
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:41,700
So he sold you three championship rings
and an autographed team ball willingly?

292
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:43,000
Well, his manager did.

293
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:44,100
Martin Wilson.

294
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,500
He gave me a good price.

295
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:47,100
I had to have it.

296
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:48,300
You had to have it?

297
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:53,000
You were online within hours
of his murder selling it, Theo.

298
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:55,400
I was going to add it
to my collection here,

299
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:59,700
but when one of these legends
dies, collectors go into a frenzy.

300
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:00,400
Right.

301
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:04,500
News breaks, your 100-k investment climbs
up to seven figures. Is that right?

302
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,500
I guess I'm a lucky guy.

303
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:09,600
Yes, but not for long.

304
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:25,100
Tragic day for the
sports world, mr. Wilson.

305
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:27,300
Doug Mcclain was a legend.

306
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:30,000
Yes. And I understand you
were his business manager.

307
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,800
And now I'm managing his estate.

308
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:34,800
And selling it off rather rapidly, too.

309
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,300
What are you talking about?

310
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:44,500
Apparently, you just sold some pieces of
memorabilia to a Theo Knight for $100, 000.

311
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:47,900
I had to.

312
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:50,300
Doug had, um...

313
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:52,200
cash flow problems.

314
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:55,000
He spent money like he
was still in his prime.

315
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:58,200
Got so bad, I had to sell his
stuff just to keep him afloat.

316
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:00,200
I notice that you have a black eye.

317
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:02,900
Now, we found mr. Mcclain
with a broken hand.

318
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:05,900
Am I to assume that he was not
happy about what you were doing?

319
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,800
It was a sore subject.

320
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:11,300
Dougie wore those on
that naked bootleg, '93.

321
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,900
Game winner.

322
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:14,600
What else you got?

323
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,300
Well, over here we have his first...

324
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,300
what the hell's going on?

325
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,700
You told me a reporter
was coming in here.

326
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:22,000
Would you excuse us for a minute?

327
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:22,800
Sure.

328
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:24,000
Thanks.

329
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:30,000
You're selling all my stuff?

330
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:31,900
This is my life.

331
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,700
If it wasn't for me,
you wouldn't have a life.

332
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:39,100
Was that before you
killed him this morning?

333
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:42,300
I was nowhere near Doug
Mcclain this morning.

334
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,200
You can check.

335
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:46,100
I'm going to.

336
00:17:57,700 --> 00:18:00,700
You're running the double-sided
tape from Doug Mcclain's windowsill?

337
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:01,700
Yeah. I already did.

338
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:05,800
You had silk fibers on one side, but
even better-- epithelials on the other.

339
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:07,800
And what would cause that?

340
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:09,000
You're such a guy.

341
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:12,000
Remember J-Lo's green versace dress?

342
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:14,500
what do you think held that up?

343
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:16,400
Double-sided adhesive?

344
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,700
This is wardrobe tape.

345
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:20,500
Did you get a profile from it?

346
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:23,300
CODIS should tell us any second.

347
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:26,100
Rita Sullivan.

348
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,800
She's got an interesting rap sheet.

349
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:32,900
One and only arrest, 2004, for
breaking and entering a residence.

350
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Yeah. She broke into
Doug Mcclain's house.

351
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:41,200
That was three years ago, and that
was a complete misunderstanding.

352
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,800
Doug and I were having an affair,

353
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:44,800
and his wife caught us in their bed,

354
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:47,200
and she completely overreacted.

355
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,800
You know that Doug Mcclain's dead?

356
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:51,400
I know. I saw it on tv.

357
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:54,000
Well, we found tape from your dress

358
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,600
that proves you entered his
house again, through a window.

359
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,600
That's because Doug
called me a few days ago

360
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,400
and asked me if I wanted to come over.

361
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:06,900
He said his wife was away.

362
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:08,100
Did you?

363
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:11,900
And when I got there, he wasn't home yet.

364
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:14,200
So why not wait, hmm?

365
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,100
Why climb through a window?

366
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:19,200
I knew Doug since his playing days.

367
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:21,800
We had a special relationship.

368
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:23,600
And I wanted to surprise him.

369
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:35,000
I was gone before dawn.

370
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:37,400
Can you prove that?

371
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:41,200
Look, I know what you're trying to
say, but I would never hurt Doug.

372
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:42,700
Never.

373
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:47,900
I think you got tired of climbing
through windows, miss Sullivan.

374
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:50,000
I think you got tired of
being Doug's second choice.

375
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:57,500
Being Doug Mcclain's second choice
was more than any girl could ask for.

376
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,600
Except being his first.

377
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:11,200
you know, there is a great thai
restaurant next to the shore club.

378
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:13,000
You don't give up, do you?

379
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:15,000
Neither do I.

380
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Now, be careful with that, girl.

381
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:18,200
You gotta make sure it's
pulled right back to your...

382
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:21,100
shoulder or it's going
to kick back. You okay?

383
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:22,400
Okay?

384
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:23,300
All right.

385
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:25,200
Yep.I'm good. All right.

386
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:32,100
I'm going to check out.

387
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:33,200
Oh, yeah?

388
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,500
Knyou ow, I... I saw
what happened out there.

389
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:38,200
Is your, um, shoulder okay?

390
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:39,600
Yep. I'm fine.

391
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:40,800
It's good.

392
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:42,700
Okay.

393
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:44,200
Take care of that shoulder.

394
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:50,000
by now, the world has heard about the
death of sports legend Doug Mcclain,

395
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,600
but tonight, on tape, you will hear his
actual death at the hand of his murderers.

396
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:59,700
Don't miss the newest and most exciting chapter
in the mystery that is gripping the nation.

397
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:03,600
Hey, Calleigh, I think we might want to
take another look at that obituary writer.

398
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:07,600
Okay, so I didn't exactly
tell you everything.

399
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:10,400
That is the understatement
of the year, miss Legassic.

400
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,900
I did call mr. Mcclain for my article.

401
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,800
But you conveniently left out the
part where you had the murder recorded.

402
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:19,900
I was taping the conversation
so I wouldn't miss anything.

403
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,400
At the time, I wasn't even
sure atwh I was hearing.

404
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,600
What exactly did you hear?

405
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:26,100
I can't say.

406
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:29,900
I signed a non-disclosure
agreement with the tv station.

407
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:31,000
It's legally binding.

408
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:32,400
So are handcuffs.

409
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:34,700
It's your choice, Wendy.

410
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:41,700
He was literally talking to me
one second and gone the next.

411
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:43,900
I kept recording until
my cell battery ran out.

412
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:48,500
And so your first instinct after you found
out he was killed was to sell the tape?

413
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:50,100
I'm not a monster, officer.

414
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:53,400
I just wanted to get out
of the obituary business.

415
00:21:54,700 --> 00:22:00,300
you thought the recording would
make you a reporter at wetx.

416
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:02,300
I've got an exclusive for you, Wendy.

417
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:04,300
That tape is never gonna make it to tv.

418
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,400
A judge has issued a warrant,

419
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:09,000
I'm confiscating it and I'm arresting
you for obstruction of justice.

420
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:11,600
Your journalism career
died with Doug Mcclain.

421
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:14,100
You can write an obituary for it.

422
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:16,900
Okay, I uploaded Wendy
Legassic's phone conversations.

423
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:17,500
What's next?

424
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:21,500
Let's start with Doug
Mcclain's final words.

425
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:24,900
I understand.

426
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:27,100
I'm sorry.

427
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:33,800
Doug, are you okay?

428
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,500
Doug?

429
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:40,600
Okay, now search for spiking activity.

430
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:45,800
here's some activity.

431
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:49,100
Almost 25 minutes after he was stabbed.

432
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:57,500
now, that sounds like somebody
moving around the house, doesn't it?

433
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:03,900
and that's somebody making a phone call.

434
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Ten digits; an area
code and a phone number.

435
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,300
Track the numbers.

436
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:08,500
I'm on it.

437
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:11,000
I use reverse directory.

438
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:14,800
Elissa Mcclain?

439
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:17,200
Lieutenant, why would the killer
be calling the victim's wife?

440
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:20,600
Because they must be connected.

441
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:25,300
Mrs. Mcclain, did you hire
somebody to kill your husband?

442
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:27,300
Absolutely not.

443
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:28,700
Why would you ask that?

444
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:32,100
Because it turns out that you and
your husband weren't living together,

445
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:36,400
and your current listing is in
coral gables under your maiden name.

446
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,900
Doug and I have been
separated for a year now.

447
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,000
I have my own place, but
we're discreet about it.

448
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:51,500
Dougeras v wy high-profile, you know, about
image control, public perception, his legacy.

449
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:52,800
It was his livelihood.

450
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:55,500
And a divorce would taint that.

451
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:58,400
Fans hold an idealized view of Doug,

452
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:04,100
and they pay big for that
perfect, infallible ideal.

453
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:06,500
Okay, so let me ask you this.

454
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:10,400
If you didn't hire somebody to kill
him, who called you from the crime scene?

455
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,800
Martin.

456
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:14,400
Doug's manager called.

457
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,100
Why would he do that?

458
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:17,900
To tell me what happened.

459
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:21,600
He wanted me back at the house before
the police or the press got there,

460
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,900
because everybody thinks that
Doug and I are still together.

461
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:26,500
Was he there when you arrived?

462
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,400
No.

463
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:37,300
Do you think he killed Doug?

464
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:39,500
Do you?

465
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:51,200
Mr. Wilson, your cell phone call to Elissa Mcclain
places you at the scene at the time of the murder.

466
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:53,100
I had a meeting with Doug this morning.

467
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:54,400
I'm his manager.

468
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:57,000
And when I found his
body, I called Elissa.

469
00:24:57,100 --> 00:25:00,500
'Cause you told us you were nowhere
near Doug Mcclain this morning.

470
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:01,800
Now, that's a flat-out lie.

471
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:06,200
Look, this is all about
discretion, damage control.

472
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:09,800
I started collecting things that Doug
wouldn't want the public to find out about:

473
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:15,900
Whiskey bottles, diet pills, little
blue pills, then I got out of there.

474
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:37,400
I sell heroes, not broken-down stars.

475
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:40,600
I'd like the items, mr. Wilson.

476
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:00,800
Who's this?

477
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,800
I took care of everything
for him but that.

478
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:06,400
Never got a straight answer.

479
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:08,000
I think it's time to get one.

480
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,500
So, are there prints on the photograph?

481
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:33,500
Yeah, but it's not usable.

482
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:36,500
But the kid's wearing Doug's old
number, and that can't be a coincidence.

483
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:37,800
No, it's not.

484
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:40,900
Also, I can see part of a logo
on the back of his helmet.

485
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:43,700
And it looks to me like
it says "lauderhill."

486
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:48,200
"Lauderhill youth program."

487
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:50,200
Exactly. That's what I thought.

488
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:51,600
Yes.

489
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:54,600
More importantly, natalia, who
is this kid?

490
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:55,500
I'll call lauderhill.

491
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:57,100
We got to find him.

492
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:04,600
Lieutenant, april.

493
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:07,100
I'm with the lauderhill youth program.

494
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,500
Thank you for coming in.

495
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:10,000
So you received our e-mail.

496
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:14,600
I guess we're hoping that you may be able
to identify the child in the photograph.

497
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:18,700
Yeah, we, uh, we sponsor a youth
football team every summer.

498
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:21,000
He was our star quarterback.

499
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:23,300
Where might I find him?

500
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:26,300
Lieutenant, he had a rare kidney disease.

501
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:28,800
He died last week.

502
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:34,100
What's his name?

503
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:35,500
Caleb.

504
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,900
Caleb Sullivan.

505
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:41,500
May I?

506
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:42,700
Sure.

507
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:47,600
Sullivan.

508
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:56,500
Is that your son, miss Sullivan?

509
00:27:58,700 --> 00:28:00,400
Yes.

510
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:03,900
Who's his father?

511
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:09,500
Doug Mcclain...

512
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:14,700
but in DNA only.

513
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:21,500
Caleb was only six
years old when he died.

514
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:32,100
You know, I never asked Doug
for anything-- money, nothing.

515
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:35,100
I raised Caleb all on my own.

516
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:38,300
He was everything to me.

517
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,300
And then he got sick.

518
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:47,200
His kidneys failed, didn't they?

519
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:53,300
Uli wod have given him both of mine,

520
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:56,800
but I wasn't a match, and there
was a good chance that Doug was.

521
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:59,500
Dougie, he idolizes you.

522
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:02,400
He even put your number
on his jersey. Please.

523
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:04,600
If he doesn't get this
transplant, he will die.

524
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:07,000
I'll need to check with my
attorney about this, okay?

525
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,300
I'll see what I can do.

526
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:10,400
Please, Dougie, he's so young.

527
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:13,400
I'll give you a call next week.

528
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:18,500
Dougie, come on!

529
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:22,300
I never heard from him.

530
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:30,700
You know, everyone acts like
Doug Mcclain was some big hero,

531
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:34,800
but the man turned his
back on his own son.

532
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:42,000
You broke into the house
this morning, didn't you?

533
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:44,800
Yeah.

534
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:51,200
I heard Doug on the
phone with some new girl.

535
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:53,300
Same as he ever was.

536
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:58,200
What if I said my most exciting
experience was talking to you, honey?

537
00:29:58,300 --> 00:30:00,700
Now you're starting to
sound like a reporter.

538
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:09,700
then you stabbed him, Rita, didn't you?

539
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:12,000
Yeah.

540
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:14,700
Okay.

541
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:18,100
Where is the knife now?

542
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:21,600
I left it in him.

543
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:25,800
Why? It's not there?

544
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:31,000
Miss Sullivan, someone removed it.

545
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:38,400
Rita Sullivan confessed?

546
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:43,500
Alexx, she confessed to
leaving the knife in the body.

547
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:45,400
We never recovered it.

548
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:46,800
Wasn't at the scene.

549
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:49,700
Well, that changes the scenario.

550
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:53,600
Although, I'm sure she
meant to finish Doug off.

551
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:55,900
But she didn't, did she?

552
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:57,400
No.

553
00:30:57,400 --> 00:31:00,100
According to the virtopsy data,

554
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:02,100
when the knife went in,

555
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:05,600
it severed his carotid artery,
paralyzing Doug

556
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:07,100
but not killing him.

557
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:11,200
The blade plugged the hole like a cork.

558
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:18,200
So the removal of the
blade is what killed him.

559
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:19,300
When the knife came out,

560
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:25,500
it unleashed the arterial blood just as
Doug's heart pumped its last three beats.

561
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:32,100
Is there anything to
suggest Rita didn't kill him?

562
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:34,100
You know, Horatio...

563
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:36,300
there may be.

564
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:40,400
See these dark spots in the wound?

565
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:41,700
That's clotted blood.

566
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:45,400
These darker portions are
coagulated red blood cells.

567
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:47,800
The light ones are fibrin and platelets.

568
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:50,600
And a dead body doesn't produce fibrin.

569
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:53,700
With this amount of clotting,

570
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:57,700
that blade had to have been inside
Doug for a significant amount of time.

571
00:31:57,700 --> 00:31:59,600
How long, Alexx?

572
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:02,600
30, 40 minutes.

573
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:03,400
30 to 40 minutes?

574
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:05,900
But the recorded phone
call was only 25 minutes.

575
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
So we're looking at a two-part murder.

576
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,400
Rita started the process...

577
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:11,500
and somebody else finished it.

578
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:25,100
Hey.

579
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:26,800
How goes it?

580
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:30,800
You know, too much evidence and
not enough hours in the day.

581
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:33,800
atth's the truth.

582
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:39,800
Man, you okay?

583
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,500
What's the matter?

584
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:42,700
I think my shoulder's out.

585
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:45,700
Oh, boy. Okay, look, you
got to go see the doctor.

586
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:46,300
I can'T.

587
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:47,300
This is going to go on my record,

588
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:50,000
and it's going to get out
that I can't shoot a shotgun.

589
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,700
It's not going back in on its own.

590
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:54,500
Okay, well...

591
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:56,700
can you do it for me?

592
00:32:57,700 --> 00:32:59,200
Please.

593
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:01,000
All right.

594
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:03,700
Just relax, okay?

595
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:04,900
Okay.

596
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:07,600
- You all right? You loose?
- Okay.

597
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:09,400
All right, good. Look at me.

598
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:11,200
All right.

599
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:12,800
okay, all right.

600
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:14,400
Put your arm over here.

601
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:15,100
Okay?

602
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:15,700
Yeah.

603
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:16,800
All right.

604
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:18,700
Just breathe.

605
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:20,100
Okay.

606
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,900
- Don't try to be a tough guy, all right?
- Okay.

607
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:26,500
It's only going to get worse.

608
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:30,100
If you need to, you go
to the doctor. All right?

609
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:32,000
Okay?

610
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:34,700
Thank you.

611
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:36,300
Thank you.

612
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:41,300
Delko.

613
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:45,300
Stetler.

614
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:47,000
What are you sniffing around about?

615
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:49,700
Horatio's got me working
to supercede a court order,

616
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:52,600
reclaim your frozen
football star's body.

617
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:54,700
Working with us for a change.

618
00:33:55,600 --> 00:34:01,500
You are aware of the pending new rules regarding
fraternization among officers, aren't you?

619
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:04,700
New as in different after
you and yelina salas?

620
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:06,000
Things have changed.

621
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:11,300
The county's caving to the state's pressure
on the issue of sexual harassment litigation.

622
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:13,100
That's interesting.

623
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:17,300
The department's redefining its
policies on fraternization of officers.

624
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:22,200
You would be best served sharing
that with the others in the lab.

625
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:26,900
Listen, Stetler, if you have something to
say to csi Duquesne or detective berkeley,

626
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:29,100
you'd best be served
telling them yourself.

627
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:30,900
Duquesne and berkeley?

628
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:37,200
I was talking about you
and boa vista, but thank you.

629
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:52,700
Calleigh, hey.

630
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:53,800
It's Delko.

631
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:56,100
I... think I might have
just put you in a jam.

632
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:58,500
Give me a call back when you
get the message, all right?

633
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:09,300
Hey, turn it around, berkeley;
we got a suspect in the grove.

634
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:10,800
Yeah, I was just coming to find you.

635
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:11,800
Great, let's go.

636
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:14,000
I can't work this case.

637
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:15,300
Why?

638
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:17,000
Because you're on it.

639
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,300
What are you talking about?

640
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:23,800
I've just been informed of pending
changes in department policy.

641
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:25,700
Are you saying that we can't
work a crime scene together

642
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:27,500
because we've been seeing each other?

643
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:28,700
More like we can't work a crime scene

644
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,200
because we may have a falling out

645
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:34,300
and things get ugly and
job performance may suffer.

646
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:36,500
You sound like you're a firm believer.

647
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:37,700
No.

648
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:40,000
I just got Rick Stetler
breathing down my neck.

649
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,500
How does Rick Stetler
know anything about us?

650
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:44,400
I don't know.

651
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:49,600
Listen, I think we should
just take a step back¡ª

652
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:52,500
let things cool down a little bit, okay?

653
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:53,900
Okay.

654
00:35:58,700 --> 00:36:00,100
Hey, Calleigh.

655
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:02,800
I heard you were riding over
to Martin Wilson's house.

656
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:04,800
I'm going to ride with you.

657
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:07,300
You might have to.

658
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,300
Calleigh, what's up?

659
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:10,800
Nothing.

660
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:11,900
What's wrong?

661
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:12,700
Did I interrupt something?

662
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:16,400
How does Rick Stetler have even the faintest
idea what's going on in my personal life?

663
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:18,400
It was an accident.

664
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:19,900
I left you a message.

665
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:20,800
I called you.

666
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,400
I didn't get it.

667
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:26,700
I never intended for
this to happen, okay?

668
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:29,800
I don't like the situation with
jake, but I wouldn't rat you out.

669
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:31,300
You know that.

670
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
Let's just work the case.

671
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:50,400
Going somewhere, mr. Wilson?

672
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:53,500
Ah, back again.

673
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:55,900
You guys are thorough, aren't you?

674
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:57,700
What's in the envelope, Martin?

675
00:36:57,700 --> 00:37:00,400
Doug's personal effects
I picked up from precore.

676
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:02,200
You know, everything has its place.

677
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:04,900
What about the murder
weapon, does it have a place?

678
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:07,100
Hey, I didn't take the knife.

679
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:09,000
He was dead, and I wasn't
about to mess with him.

680
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:10,200
He wasn't dead.

681
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:12,800
He bled out after the
knife was extracted.

682
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:14,700
He died over 30 minutes
after he was stabbed,

683
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:15,800
and you were right there.

684
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:17,800
Look, I have been
nothing but cooperative.

685
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:19,400
Feel free to open it up.

686
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:21,100
Whatever you want.

687
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:31,100
What are you doing
with a body bag, Wilson?

688
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:33,700
That's Doug's also.

689
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:34,500
I'm not working now,

690
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:37,800
and I figured it would be the
last big ticket item I could sell.

691
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:40,600
Wow, you're a real class act, Martin.

692
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:45,600
Something's punctured right
through the bag from the inside.

693
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:48,500
It's about the same width
as the wound in Doug's neck.

694
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,200
Hey, I have no idea how that got there.

695
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:53,900
What a surprise.

696
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,200
This is coming with us.

697
00:37:55,300 --> 00:37:57,200
And so are you.

698
00:37:57,400 --> 00:38:00,500
Precore is concerned with
organ and tissue preservation.

699
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:04,000
Preparing Doug Mcclain's blood
vessels and cells for cryo storage.

700
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,000
We are not concerned
about the plastic body bag.

701
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:12,300
The body bag, dr. Klein, was used to smuggle
the murder weapon away from my crime scene.

702
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:16,800
Now, did you remove the knife
from mr. Mcclain's neck?

703
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,800
I'm a scientist, lieutenant.

704
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:22,600
I've been around long enough to know
you're making enormous suppositions.

705
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:25,400
That may be, but I want
you to open the tank.

706
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:27,900
You're going to have to take
this up with judge Porterson.

707
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:31,500
To bring you up to speed,
the judge has rescinded the court order.

708
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:32,800
So open the tank.

709
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:34,600
I... can't do that.

710
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:38,400
The neuropod's already been set
to negative 320 degrees fahrenheit.

711
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:41,100
We take him out, his preservation
could be compromised.

712
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:45,000
And if we don't, so will yours.

713
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:46,700
Open it.

714
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:25,700
what's that?

715
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:31,400
That, mrs. Mcclain, is the murder weapon
which we found next to your husband's body.

716
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:36,100
And that is your fingerprint.

717
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:41,200
They told me it would be 40
years before they opened that.

718
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:46,300
I can assure you the investigation
can't wait that long, mrs. Mcclain.

719
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:49,000
I didn't want to go there.

720
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:54,800
I didn't want to see Doug like that.

721
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:59,500
But Martin, his manager, insisted.

722
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:02,800
Wanted me to play the
part of the grieving widow.

723
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:05,800
So you kept up appearances.

724
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,500
I went back to the house.

725
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,200
I found him there.

726
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:20,000
I couldn't believe what I was seeing.

727
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:25,400
I called precore.

728
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:29,000
Which is when you realized
he was still alive.

729
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:31,400
I heard him groan.

730
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:37,200
It was... it was so soft,

731
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:39,900
I thought I'd imagined it.

732
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:45,900
I didn't know what to do.

733
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:50,800
Martin wanted to protect the estate.

734
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:53,000
His reputation.

735
00:40:53,700 --> 00:41:00,500
But... I just couldn't pretend anymore.

736
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:05,300
The way Doug was living
his life, he was...

737
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:09,500
he was depreciating every day.

738
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:11,800
And he was dragging me and
our daughter down with him.

739
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:16,200
He was just going to keep screwing up until
everything just came crashing down around us.

740
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:19,300
So he was worth more
to you dead than alive.

741
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:21,900
Is that what you're telling me?

742
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:27,600
So I pulled out the knife.

743
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:42,700
and like that, it was over.

744
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:46,800
He bled to death.

745
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:50,500
Doctor, please...

746
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:51,900
take this from me.

747
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:54,800
I'm sorry, mrs. Mcclain, I
can't take that knife.

748
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:56,900
My husband is the
biggest name is sports.

749
00:41:56,900 --> 00:41:59,800
This is publicity you can't buy.

750
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:03,700
Now, if you want his body in
your facility you will do this.

751
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:06,600
I'm calling 911.

752
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:13,100
Precore takes their van for
one lap around the block.

753
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:15,200
Arrives shortly after you do.

754
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:30,300
And I play my role one last time.

755
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:42,900
Mrs. Mcclain, I can assure you, that the next
several years are going to be very real.
