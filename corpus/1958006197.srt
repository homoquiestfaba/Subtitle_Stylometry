1
00:01:39,795 --> 00:01:40,796
Oh!

2
00:01:44,191 --> 00:01:46,496
Sorry. Okay.

3
00:01:46,497 --> 00:01:48,498
- After you, Sandy.
- Oh, my God. You get it?

4
00:01:48,499 --> 00:01:49,978
Yes.

5
00:01:49,979 --> 00:01:51,327
Is there anything you wanted?
You guys...

6
00:01:51,328 --> 00:01:53,024
Welcome.

7
00:01:53,025 --> 00:01:54,417
You look so good!

8
00:01:54,418 --> 00:01:56,115
- Yeah, I love the costume.
- And you got the news?

9
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:57,725
- Yeah, we all did.
- Hey, how's it going?

10
00:01:57,726 --> 00:01:59,988
Uh, a little treat, I think.

11
00:01:59,989 --> 00:02:02,599
Yeah, I'll grab a black coffee?

12
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:05,167
And we'll grab Sandy's coffee.

13
00:02:05,168 --> 00:02:06,734
- Oh, thanks.
- Yeah, you're welcome.

14
00:02:06,735 --> 00:02:08,823
- The usual, "Sandy"?
- Yes.

15
00:02:08,824 --> 00:02:10,259
- I'm Zoey.
- I'm Enzo.

16
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:11,565
- Hi. Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

17
00:02:11,566 --> 00:02:13,524
- Paolo. Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

18
00:02:15,004 --> 00:02:16,352
So, where are you guys from?

19
00:02:16,353 --> 00:02:18,528
Well, I'm from Australia,
but I flew in from Milan.

20
00:02:18,529 --> 00:02:20,182
Oh, good.
So you missed the whole...

21
00:02:20,183 --> 00:02:22,271
Yeah, just made it. So lucky.
If anything closed...

22
00:02:22,272 --> 00:02:23,577
I think we were, like,
one of the last flights.

23
00:02:23,578 --> 00:02:25,535
- Super lucky. We're really like...
- Yeah.

24
00:02:25,536 --> 00:02:27,929
In Red Hook, it's crazy right now.
The trees are down.

25
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:30,149
I mean, I thought Hurricane
Sandy was gonna be like Irene.

26
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:34,022
Why does everybody underestimate
the female hurricanes?

27
00:02:34,023 --> 00:02:36,372
I think this one's gonna be bad.

28
00:02:36,373 --> 00:02:37,895
So you guys friends, or...

29
00:02:37,896 --> 00:02:39,419
- We're actually brothers.
- Yeah.

30
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:42,465
From different mothers.
Literally. That's not a joke.

31
00:02:42,466 --> 00:02:44,685
- Yeah, well, long story.
- Long story.

32
00:02:44,686 --> 00:02:46,034
A story for another time.

33
00:02:46,035 --> 00:02:47,296
Well, if you guys
are around later,

34
00:02:47,297 --> 00:02:50,212
my roommates and I,
um, we live upstairs,

35
00:02:50,213 --> 00:02:51,648
but, um, we're
having people over.

36
00:02:51,649 --> 00:02:53,172
What's the theme?
Did you figure it out?

37
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:56,044
There's a lot of tension between

38
00:02:56,045 --> 00:02:58,307
it's either vintage Halloween

39
00:02:58,308 --> 00:03:00,831
- or fall for Sandy.
- "Fall for Sandy"?

40
00:03:00,832 --> 00:03:02,920
It's like, we fell
for Hurricane Irene,

41
00:03:02,921 --> 00:03:04,966
- Fall for Sandy...
- Oh!

42
00:03:04,967 --> 00:03:07,011
But also, autumn.

43
00:03:07,012 --> 00:03:08,926
I like that, I like a good autumn.
I don't like a good autumn.

44
00:03:08,927 --> 00:03:10,537
- Double entendre.
- Yes.

45
00:03:10,538 --> 00:03:12,147
We have dinner plans tonight,
but maybe we'll come back later.

46
00:03:12,148 --> 00:03:13,757
- Yeah, I mean...
- We don't know if those are good, anyway.

47
00:03:13,758 --> 00:03:15,063
- That's true, yeah.
- Yeah.

48
00:03:15,064 --> 00:03:17,500
It's just the second floor
facing the window.

49
00:03:17,501 --> 00:03:19,067
- Okay.
- 2B.

50
00:03:19,068 --> 00:03:20,677
Okay, well, or not to be.

51
00:03:20,678 --> 00:03:22,679
Well, I hope it's to be.

52
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,115
Yeah, so do I.

53
00:03:24,116 --> 00:03:26,293
Ignore that. That was silly.
That was really silly.

54
00:03:26,945 --> 00:03:28,511
Thanks for the cup.

55
00:03:28,512 --> 00:03:30,034
Yeah. Thanks for the coffee.
It was great.

56
00:03:30,035 --> 00:03:31,080
Great, thanks.

57
00:03:31,863 --> 00:03:32,864
- See you.
- Bye.

58
00:03:38,087 --> 00:03:40,219
Well...
Inviting strangers.

59
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,743
- Just felt right.
- Just felt right.

60
00:03:57,193 --> 00:03:58,759
Hey, Mom. ZOEY'S MOM: [ON
PHONE] Hey, honey, are you okay?

61
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:01,631
I'm fine.
I'm just... I'm tired.

62
00:04:01,632 --> 00:04:03,198
ZOEY'S MOM: Did you hear
about the apartment?

63
00:04:03,199 --> 00:04:05,331
Yeah, we just got the notice.

64
00:04:05,332 --> 00:04:07,855
I want you to come home
and live with me.

65
00:04:07,856 --> 00:04:09,770
I love you,
but I'm not gonna move home.

66
00:04:09,771 --> 00:04:12,686
Why not?
So, do you have a plan

67
00:04:12,687 --> 00:04:14,557
- of where you're gonna go?
- Yeah. Uh-huh.

68
00:04:14,558 --> 00:04:15,645
Are you sure?

69
00:04:15,646 --> 00:04:16,777
- Yeah.
- Are you okay?

70
00:04:16,778 --> 00:04:18,735
No, I'm just... I'm... I'm...

71
00:04:18,736 --> 00:04:20,868
- All right.
- Just tired.

72
00:04:20,869 --> 00:04:23,740
I just want you to be okay,
all right?

73
00:04:23,741 --> 00:04:25,612
So, are you guys
prepared for the storm?

74
00:04:25,613 --> 00:04:27,309
Yeah, we're prepared.

75
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:28,484
Do you have everything you need?

76
00:04:28,485 --> 00:04:31,008
Definitely. Yeah.
We're very prepared.

77
00:04:31,009 --> 00:04:33,750
God bless you. You take
good care of yourself.

78
00:04:33,751 --> 00:04:34,882
Uh-huh.

79
00:04:34,883 --> 00:04:36,100
Bye, say hi to the girls.

80
00:04:36,101 --> 00:04:37,363
Isn't that cute?

81
00:04:37,364 --> 00:04:38,712
- They're so nice.
- I know, I love them.

82
00:04:38,713 --> 00:04:39,930
Hold on, hold on a sec.

83
00:04:39,931 --> 00:04:41,716
ZOEY'S MOM: It's getting
so quiet.

84
00:04:43,021 --> 00:04:45,022
"Dear Zoey, Liza and Jen,
please be informed

85
00:04:45,023 --> 00:04:46,720
"that an inspector will be
entering your apartment

86
00:04:46,721 --> 00:04:48,025
"within the next 48 hours

87
00:04:48,026 --> 00:04:49,331
"to prepare your move out

88
00:04:49,332 --> 00:04:51,252
"scheduled to take place
by the end of November."

89
00:04:57,558 --> 00:04:58,776
- I'm sorry.
- I know.

90
00:05:00,387 --> 00:05:01,691
Zoey. Zoey?

91
00:05:01,692 --> 00:05:02,737
Yeah.

92
00:05:04,565 --> 00:05:06,348
Thank you.

93
00:05:06,349 --> 00:05:08,350
Last one to shower
fills the tub.

94
00:05:08,351 --> 00:05:09,396
Okay.

95
00:05:21,233 --> 00:05:22,756
Hi, did you eat?

96
00:05:22,757 --> 00:05:23,801
Yeah.

97
00:05:31,287 --> 00:05:33,115
Jen is going crazy.

98
00:05:34,072 --> 00:05:35,465
Yeah, I know.

99
00:05:37,119 --> 00:05:39,294
Oh. Do you want to trade me
the petty glitter?

100
00:05:39,295 --> 00:05:40,382
Sure.

101
00:05:40,383 --> 00:05:41,427
Got some new colors.

102
00:05:41,428 --> 00:05:43,733
Ah, what does it... I can't...

103
00:05:43,734 --> 00:05:45,082
"Storm ready"?

104
00:05:45,083 --> 00:05:46,301
Yeah.

105
00:05:46,302 --> 00:05:48,521
I feel like
the big nail polish industry

106
00:05:48,522 --> 00:05:50,218
is just capitalizing
on this storm,

107
00:05:50,219 --> 00:05:51,611
just trying to sell
more nail polish.

108
00:05:51,612 --> 00:05:53,874
Oh, my God.
Don't let Jen hear you.

109
00:05:53,875 --> 00:05:55,223
She'll be so upset

110
00:05:55,224 --> 00:05:58,095
that all of her hurricane aid
was for naught.

111
00:05:58,096 --> 00:06:00,924
Tease me all you want,
but you'll thank me later.

112
00:06:00,925 --> 00:06:03,187
Remember to... Fill the tub!

113
00:06:03,188 --> 00:06:04,842
We know.

114
00:06:05,756 --> 00:06:08,236
Oh, my God.

115
00:06:08,237 --> 00:06:11,065
So can I just leave it like
this, or do I need to drain it?

116
00:06:11,066 --> 00:06:12,110
You're disgusting.

117
00:06:15,157 --> 00:06:18,639
- Liza! Door. Thanks.
- Sorry.

118
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:21,858
Sorry, I know
it's your time to read,

119
00:06:21,859 --> 00:06:24,078
but I need
to tell you something.

120
00:06:24,079 --> 00:06:26,429
We had a dog and didn't go on
to Hannah's. It was stupid.

121
00:06:28,518 --> 00:06:29,693
That's what you get.

122
00:06:32,522 --> 00:06:33,566
Why are you telling me that?

123
00:06:33,567 --> 00:06:34,655
Just wanted to... Zip it.

124
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:38,316
The time my brother wanted to do math!
No, no, no.

125
00:06:41,009 --> 00:06:42,010
What?

126
00:06:54,762 --> 00:06:55,763
Are we gonna do this?

127
00:06:58,853 --> 00:06:59,854
Storm ready?

128
00:07:02,857 --> 00:07:03,900
It's too much.

129
00:07:03,901 --> 00:07:05,380
I know.
It's so much. I love it.

130
00:07:05,381 --> 00:07:07,643
No, there's too many themes.

131
00:07:07,644 --> 00:07:08,949
No, it's just cute.

132
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:10,690
- This looks amazing.
- You look amazing.

133
00:07:10,691 --> 00:07:11,995
You look so good!

134
00:07:11,996 --> 00:07:13,475
Oh, my God.

135
00:07:13,476 --> 00:07:14,824
- So pretty.
- Oh, pretty.

136
00:07:14,825 --> 00:07:16,609
That's where that was,
I was looking for that.

137
00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:18,611
- Didn't I ask for it?
- No.

138
00:07:18,612 --> 00:07:19,742
- Ow!
- Give her 200 bucks!

139
00:07:19,743 --> 00:07:21,744
You are out of control.

140
00:07:21,745 --> 00:07:22,876
Did you fill up the tub?

141
00:07:22,877 --> 00:07:25,357
Yes, I'll just go triple check.

142
00:07:25,967 --> 00:07:27,881
I filled the tub.

143
00:07:27,882 --> 00:07:29,186
- Called it.
- Thank you.

144
00:07:29,187 --> 00:07:30,492
You're welcome.

145
00:07:30,493 --> 00:07:32,451
- You smell so good.
- Thanks.

146
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:33,495
Julian's gonna love this.

147
00:07:33,496 --> 00:07:34,583
No, he's not coming.

148
00:07:34,584 --> 00:07:36,237
- Why not?
- I didn't invite him.

149
00:07:36,238 --> 00:07:37,456
You spent the night at his
house, you didn't invite him?

150
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:39,022
He didn't understand
my Sandy costume.

151
00:07:39,023 --> 00:07:40,546
He thought
I was a deranged clown.

152
00:07:40,547 --> 00:07:42,156
Did anyone understand
your costume?

153
00:07:42,157 --> 00:07:43,549
Yes, actually.

154
00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:46,421
I met a man who did understand
and I invited him.

155
00:07:46,422 --> 00:07:47,509
What?

156
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:48,684
And his brother.

157
00:07:48,685 --> 00:07:50,338
Two strange mystery men?

158
00:07:50,339 --> 00:07:51,774
Two strange, tall mystery men.

159
00:07:51,775 --> 00:07:53,734
Okay, you're freaking her out.
You need to relax.

160
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:57,519
This is for you.

161
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,260
- Fall for Sandy!
- Thank you.

162
00:07:59,261 --> 00:08:01,524
A vintage Halloween soiree.

163
00:08:02,003 --> 00:08:03,091
You all...

164
00:08:04,571 --> 00:08:06,136
Oh, my God.

165
00:08:06,137 --> 00:08:07,877
- Hello.
- How are you doing?

166
00:08:07,878 --> 00:08:09,009
You walked here?

167
00:08:09,010 --> 00:08:10,489
You're drenched.

168
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:12,012
Yes, a crane dropped on the way.

169
00:08:12,013 --> 00:08:13,057
Aw!

170
00:08:17,932 --> 00:08:19,193
Hi.

171
00:08:19,194 --> 00:08:20,586
Oh!

172
00:08:20,587 --> 00:08:21,717
Some pastry.

173
00:08:21,718 --> 00:08:23,763
Hey, mama, how are you?

174
00:08:23,764 --> 00:08:24,852
Good, thank you.

175
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:31,902
We walked in...

176
00:08:35,123 --> 00:08:36,384
This is embarrassing.

177
00:08:36,385 --> 00:08:38,025
You have to put
your finger in that thing.

178
00:08:39,083 --> 00:08:40,520
You gotta put your hand in here.

179
00:08:45,133 --> 00:08:46,263
This is Bianca.

180
00:08:46,264 --> 00:08:47,613
First day jitters!

181
00:08:47,614 --> 00:08:49,440
- This is her first day?
- Well, it's a hangout.

182
00:08:49,441 --> 00:08:50,877
It's a hangout.

183
00:08:50,878 --> 00:08:53,228
- It's a chill sesh.
- It's a chill sesh.

184
00:09:04,674 --> 00:09:08,982
It looks like a crane collapsed
on 57th street.

185
00:09:08,983 --> 00:09:11,288
Okay, this is saying winds
are 95 miles an hour.

186
00:09:11,289 --> 00:09:12,508
Ninety-five?

187
00:09:14,075 --> 00:09:15,945
A crane,
like a construction crane.

188
00:09:15,946 --> 00:09:18,208
Don't worry, I put together
a bunch of stuff just in case

189
00:09:18,209 --> 00:09:19,514
anything happens.

190
00:09:19,515 --> 00:09:21,429
I'm aware
that it's better to be prepared.

191
00:09:21,430 --> 00:09:23,605
A kit for us, okay?

192
00:09:23,606 --> 00:09:24,650
Oh.

193
00:09:24,651 --> 00:09:26,826
So, we've got a first aid kit.

194
00:09:26,827 --> 00:09:29,089
Trash bags, candles.

195
00:09:29,090 --> 00:09:31,308
And a bunch of water.
We also filled up the tub

196
00:09:31,309 --> 00:09:32,919
to make sure
that we have extra reserves.

197
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:35,486
And also an AM/FM radio, okay?
So...

198
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:38,098
There's a lot of really good
alternative music stations on there.

199
00:09:38,099 --> 00:09:40,361
Jen, I think
that's really thoughtful.

200
00:09:40,362 --> 00:09:41,928
This is great.

201
00:09:41,929 --> 00:09:43,756
All right, you don't know
what's gonna happen, you guys.

202
00:09:43,757 --> 00:09:45,714
All the talk about it has been
that it's gonna be pretty serious.

203
00:09:45,715 --> 00:09:48,238
So I just thought
that I would prepare the party.

204
00:09:48,239 --> 00:09:49,892
Well, you did a good job.
You did a good job.

205
00:09:49,893 --> 00:09:51,894
- Thanks, Mom.
- Thank you.

206
00:09:51,895 --> 00:09:54,984
And if anything happens, you guys
know where the fire exit is, right?

207
00:09:54,985 --> 00:09:58,379
Okay, so it's out the hallway, and
then we go out that big back hall.

208
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:00,382
And there's a...

209
00:10:03,515 --> 00:10:05,386
You didn't know where it was?

210
00:10:05,387 --> 00:10:07,170
- Well, now I do.
- Exactly!

211
00:10:07,171 --> 00:10:09,564
So it's out the hallway, and out
that big back hall. You guys.

212
00:10:09,565 --> 00:10:12,611
I think we should have a drink, just,
like, chill out. We're gonna be fine.

213
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:14,265
Yeah, let's have
a drink or something.

214
00:10:14,744 --> 00:10:16,440
Oh, man.

215
00:10:16,441 --> 00:10:18,312
My cousin, Julia,
and her husband aren't coming.

216
00:10:18,313 --> 00:10:19,574
Aw!

217
00:10:19,575 --> 00:10:22,272
They can't get a cab
from the upper west side.

218
00:10:22,273 --> 00:10:25,189
Guess they'll have to take
a rain check, badam pum tss.

219
00:10:26,364 --> 00:10:28,236
Pretty good.

220
00:10:32,544 --> 00:10:34,154
- What is that?
- Yeah, it's like a...

221
00:10:34,155 --> 00:10:35,459
A flood alert or something?

222
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:37,548
Yeah, it's on here.

223
00:10:37,549 --> 00:10:39,246
Wait, everyone's getting it?
I'm not getting it.

224
00:10:39,247 --> 00:10:40,683
Yeah, flood alert.

225
00:10:41,728 --> 00:10:43,380
That's so crazy.

226
00:10:43,381 --> 00:10:44,991
- Did you get it?
- Yeah, I got it.

227
00:10:44,992 --> 00:10:46,340
It's saying... Yeah.

228
00:10:46,341 --> 00:10:48,298
Bloomberg just posted,

229
00:10:48,299 --> 00:10:50,692
"This is the storm
of the century."

230
00:10:50,693 --> 00:10:52,173
You guys, turn on the TV.

231
00:10:56,873 --> 00:10:59,048
The high winds
from Hurricane Sandy

232
00:10:59,049 --> 00:11:02,443
are suspected of causing the
facade of an apartment building

233
00:11:02,444 --> 00:11:05,794
to collapse
in Lower Manhattan, today.

234
00:11:05,795 --> 00:11:08,232
Apparently,
apartment buildings around...

235
00:11:12,106 --> 00:11:14,020
- Wait...
- I'm gonna... I'm gonna check outside.

236
00:11:14,021 --> 00:11:15,717
- Maybe the breaker or something?
- Liam, be careful.

237
00:11:15,718 --> 00:11:18,459
- I didn't tape the window.
- It was gonna open anyway.

238
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:19,982
- Guys, there's no power on the whole block.
- Oh, my God.

239
00:11:19,983 --> 00:11:21,549
- Are you kidding?
- There's no power.

240
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:23,594
Okay, let's go to the roof,
we can see how far it goes.

241
00:11:23,595 --> 00:11:24,857
Seriously?

242
00:11:24,858 --> 00:11:26,250
- Roof!
- Okay, okay.

243
00:11:26,947 --> 00:11:29,165
This is a bad idea.

244
00:11:29,166 --> 00:11:31,733
Zoey, this is too dangerous,
you guys.

245
00:11:31,734 --> 00:11:33,170
Man, I kinda wanna see.

246
00:11:40,177 --> 00:11:41,743
I got it. I got it.

247
00:11:41,744 --> 00:11:44,050
Here, put these trash bags on.

248
00:11:44,051 --> 00:11:45,791
- Put it on.
- Watch your step, you guys.

249
00:11:45,792 --> 00:11:47,271
Zoey, don't run so fast.

250
00:12:22,611 --> 00:12:23,654
Zoey!

251
00:12:23,655 --> 00:12:24,700
Zoey!

252
00:12:47,505 --> 00:12:48,768
You guys hear that?

253
00:12:49,986 --> 00:12:51,900
There's someone out there.

254
00:12:51,901 --> 00:12:54,250
You guys, I think the brothers
are here.

255
00:12:54,251 --> 00:12:56,905
I'm gonna go let them in, okay?

256
00:12:56,906 --> 00:12:58,428
- What? What are you saying?
- The brothers.

257
00:12:58,429 --> 00:12:59,865
From Tim and Joe's.

258
00:12:59,866 --> 00:13:01,214
I'm gonna go get them.

259
00:13:01,215 --> 00:13:03,304
- No, do not.
- You're not going anywhere.

260
00:13:04,435 --> 00:13:05,871
I'll go get them.

261
00:13:05,872 --> 00:13:07,395
Yeah, I'll go with you.

262
00:13:22,323 --> 00:13:23,671
You want?

263
00:13:23,672 --> 00:13:24,716
Yes, please.

264
00:13:39,688 --> 00:13:41,558
- Hey. How are you doing?
- Hey.

265
00:13:41,559 --> 00:13:43,343
This is Enzo, I'm Paolo.

266
00:13:43,344 --> 00:13:45,171
- Hey, nice to meet you.
- Paolo.

267
00:13:45,172 --> 00:13:46,477
Nice to meet you, Enzo.

268
00:13:47,696 --> 00:13:48,915
Hey.

269
00:13:50,917 --> 00:13:52,440
We'll keep warm.

270
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:55,398
- Hi. Paolo.
- Hi.

271
00:13:55,399 --> 00:13:56,965
Hi, I'm Bianca.

272
00:13:56,966 --> 00:13:59,228
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

273
00:13:59,229 --> 00:14:00,882
- Hey, you okay?
- Yeah.

274
00:14:00,883 --> 00:14:02,144
I'm sorry, I went with Jen.

275
00:14:02,145 --> 00:14:03,406
That's okay.

276
00:14:03,407 --> 00:14:04,527
- You good?
- Yeah, I'm good.

277
00:14:28,955 --> 00:14:30,870
Let's. Okay.

278
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:43,708
- You guys want some wine?
- Oh, thanks.

279
00:14:46,146 --> 00:14:47,625
Cheers.

280
00:14:56,721 --> 00:14:59,941
So you guys were saying
there's a long story.

281
00:14:59,942 --> 00:15:01,595
- The two mothers.
- Oh, Yes. Yes.

282
00:15:01,596 --> 00:15:04,119
- Well, we have all this time, so...
- We have time.

283
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:06,208
Yeah, well,

284
00:15:06,209 --> 00:15:07,384
we have the same dad.

285
00:15:08,255 --> 00:15:09,647
Paolo, who's my older brother...

286
00:15:10,170 --> 00:15:11,822
Um, Dad

287
00:15:11,823 --> 00:15:14,651
met my mum when
he was travelling to Australia.

288
00:15:14,652 --> 00:15:18,264
She's from Indonesia originally.

289
00:15:18,265 --> 00:15:19,527
And they fell in love.

290
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:26,099
And he was still married
to Paolo's mum.

291
00:15:29,232 --> 00:15:31,451
So, that kind of happened.

292
00:15:31,452 --> 00:15:33,933
And then, probably
about a year later, I was born.

293
00:15:34,324 --> 00:15:35,716
In Italy.

294
00:15:35,717 --> 00:15:38,371
So you guys have been
in relationship with each other?

295
00:15:38,372 --> 00:15:39,895
Yeah, we grew up together.

296
00:15:40,330 --> 00:15:41,852
Summers.

297
00:15:41,853 --> 00:15:43,245
Well, we're kinda catching up.

298
00:15:43,246 --> 00:15:45,161
Gonna hang out for a week
and then I'm gonna

299
00:15:46,728 --> 00:15:49,817
hit the road
and go on a road trip by myself.

300
00:15:49,818 --> 00:15:51,123
To see the sights?
I'm drinking here, so...

301
00:15:51,124 --> 00:15:52,733
Does anyone have a phone
that's getting through?

302
00:15:52,734 --> 00:15:54,604
I just wanna text my girlfriend
to tell her that...

303
00:15:54,605 --> 00:15:55,823
No, my...

304
00:15:55,824 --> 00:15:57,042
Mine's dead.

305
00:15:57,043 --> 00:15:59,392
Oh, you know what,
I'm so fucking stupid.

306
00:15:59,393 --> 00:16:01,437
I can't text her anyway because

307
00:16:01,438 --> 00:16:03,570
I don't know her number.

308
00:16:03,571 --> 00:16:06,094
Does that make me bad
for not knowing her number?

309
00:16:06,095 --> 00:16:10,142
I only know one number, it's
my buddy, Chad's mom's number.

310
00:16:10,143 --> 00:16:11,534
Because I call her.

311
00:16:11,535 --> 00:16:13,928
We grew up together
and I would call Chad but

312
00:16:13,929 --> 00:16:15,799
I call her every year
on Mother's Day.

313
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:17,018
- It's a landline.
- Yeah it's a landline.

314
00:16:17,019 --> 00:16:20,065
- That's so cute.
- 5-3-9-0-3-9-1.

315
00:16:20,066 --> 00:16:21,414
- That's so cute.
- Aw.

316
00:16:21,415 --> 00:16:23,546
Whose phone is not dead
at this point?

317
00:16:23,547 --> 00:16:25,070
- Mine's working.
- Yours is working?

318
00:16:25,071 --> 00:16:26,419
Mmm-hmm, I don't have
any internet, but it's working.

319
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:27,811
Do you have any service?

320
00:16:27,812 --> 00:16:29,944
- Yeah, kinda.
- I have a little bit left.

321
00:16:29,945 --> 00:16:31,467
I'm just, like, hogging it and holding
it for the last... I don't know how long.

322
00:16:31,468 --> 00:16:33,034
Me, too, and I keep pressing it.

323
00:16:33,035 --> 00:16:34,210
Just, like, maybe.

324
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:36,081
It's like a kneejerk...

325
00:16:36,082 --> 00:16:37,560
You know what, you guys...

326
00:16:37,561 --> 00:16:39,649
- It's my favorite phone.
- I know, just in case

327
00:16:39,650 --> 00:16:41,608
it comes back on.

328
00:16:41,609 --> 00:16:43,500
- Let me try it one more time, see if I can get it.
- I can call my mom.

329
00:16:43,524 --> 00:16:45,568
We are gathered here today

330
00:16:45,569 --> 00:16:48,310
to bid adieu to our sweet,
sweet telephones.

331
00:16:48,311 --> 00:16:49,704
- Oh, no.
- No!

332
00:16:51,053 --> 00:16:52,445
Boo!

333
00:16:52,446 --> 00:16:56,057
Dearest phone, you are
a constant source of comfort

334
00:16:56,058 --> 00:16:57,798
and distraction.

335
00:16:57,799 --> 00:16:59,452
Both good and bad.

336
00:16:59,453 --> 00:17:03,108
You allow me to connect to the
people I love most in this world.

337
00:17:03,109 --> 00:17:05,719
And you allow me
to completely disengage

338
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:08,462
from the people
who I love most in this world.

339
00:17:12,335 --> 00:17:13,554
Good night, sweet prince.

340
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:17,078
That was good.

341
00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:18,993
Words can be a lot...

342
00:17:18,994 --> 00:17:21,604
Hoping we would be able
to get in touch with them,

343
00:17:21,605 --> 00:17:23,171
'cause I haven't heard from her.

344
00:17:23,172 --> 00:17:25,392
Okay, don't make me
feel bad about this.

345
00:17:26,654 --> 00:17:28,568
It's kind of like
a thing that I'm doing.

346
00:17:28,569 --> 00:17:30,135
- All right, um...
- Switch them off.

347
00:17:30,136 --> 00:17:32,093
Em, I hope you're safe.

348
00:17:32,094 --> 00:17:35,096
If you're on your way,
I hope you scream loud

349
00:17:35,097 --> 00:17:36,141
so we can come get you.

350
00:17:36,142 --> 00:17:37,446
How dare you?
How dare you?

351
00:17:37,447 --> 00:17:38,839
You're making it very real.

352
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:40,188
You're making this too real.

353
00:17:40,189 --> 00:17:42,930
I love you so much.

354
00:17:42,931 --> 00:17:45,541
It will be okay.
Oh, my God.

355
00:17:45,542 --> 00:17:47,413
- Are you crying?
- I just can't...

356
00:17:47,414 --> 00:17:49,937
In the name of the Father,
the Son and the Holy Phone.

357
00:17:49,938 --> 00:17:51,678
Yeah!

358
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:53,201
- Amen!
- Bye.

359
00:17:53,202 --> 00:17:54,289
- Amen!
- Wow.

360
00:17:54,290 --> 00:17:56,552
- Rest in peace.
- Good riddance.

361
00:17:56,553 --> 00:17:57,858
I feel very free.

362
00:17:57,859 --> 00:17:59,947
- I feel good.
- I do, too.

363
00:17:59,948 --> 00:18:01,427
- Funny.
- I'm kind of upset

364
00:18:01,428 --> 00:18:03,081
that you guys are gonna
lose this place soon.

365
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:06,171
Yeah, that's one word for it.
It sucks.

366
00:18:06,172 --> 00:18:08,129
Can we have that when you leave?

367
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:09,870
Oh, you wanna inherit that?

368
00:18:09,871 --> 00:18:12,481
- This thing? No!
- Yeah. For the coffee shop.

369
00:18:12,482 --> 00:18:14,396
Yeah, you can have it.

370
00:18:14,397 --> 00:18:16,616
What do you mean, "You can..." You
can't give that away, that's mine.

371
00:18:16,617 --> 00:18:18,008
- No, it's not.
- Yes, it is!

372
00:18:18,009 --> 00:18:20,010
We split it, remember?

373
00:18:20,011 --> 00:18:21,403
Well, you were with me
when I bought it.

374
00:18:21,404 --> 00:18:23,579
- And I paid you. Yes.
- Did she pay?

375
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:25,146
So you just cut it down
in the middle.

376
00:18:25,147 --> 00:18:26,713
I mean, it is, honestly,

377
00:18:26,714 --> 00:18:29,411
best that it goes with them
because we don't have places

378
00:18:29,412 --> 00:18:31,196
to put it in 30 days.

379
00:18:31,197 --> 00:18:32,762
- None of us.
- That's true.

380
00:18:32,763 --> 00:18:35,156
Nobody has a home
for this thing.

381
00:18:35,157 --> 00:18:36,505
So you can have it.

382
00:18:36,506 --> 00:18:37,593
Thank you.

383
00:18:37,594 --> 00:18:39,595
I'm sensing a little bit of, um,

384
00:18:39,596 --> 00:18:41,075
I don't know, some tension...

385
00:18:41,076 --> 00:18:43,295
- Yeah, that's very perceptive.
- between you.

386
00:18:43,296 --> 00:18:45,559
Just bear with me. One sec.

387
00:18:45,907 --> 00:18:47,560
Okay?

388
00:18:47,561 --> 00:18:49,344
Everyone's full
of ideas tonight.

389
00:18:49,345 --> 00:18:50,780
Yeah, everybody has a lot of...

390
00:18:50,781 --> 00:18:52,391
Do you smell cookies?
Wait, hold up.

391
00:18:52,392 --> 00:18:54,176
Are y'all making cookies
or some shit?

392
00:18:55,525 --> 00:18:57,178
Are y'all making butter walnut
cookies or what?

393
00:18:57,179 --> 00:18:59,049
Uh, I wish.

394
00:18:59,050 --> 00:19:01,269
- Don't you smell that, though?
- Yeah, it's nice.

395
00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:02,618
It must be next door.

396
00:19:02,619 --> 00:19:04,925
Thank you for waiting,
my name is Doctor Liam.

397
00:19:04,926 --> 00:19:07,667
Oh, he's a therapist.

398
00:19:07,668 --> 00:19:10,191
- Oh! Therapist.
- I'm here, today,

399
00:19:10,192 --> 00:19:13,542
to explore the emotional journey
you three are

400
00:19:13,543 --> 00:19:14,978
about to embark upon.

401
00:19:14,979 --> 00:19:17,807
Now, I've found it to be helpful
with previous clients

402
00:19:17,808 --> 00:19:20,854
to partake in some roleplay
in order to empathize

403
00:19:20,855 --> 00:19:23,204
and really understand
the experience

404
00:19:23,205 --> 00:19:24,901
of your fellow roommates.

405
00:19:24,902 --> 00:19:27,687
You, my dear,
will be playing Liza.

406
00:19:27,688 --> 00:19:30,559
- Okay.
- What a lucky girl.

407
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:32,909
Jen will be taking
the role of Zoey.

408
00:19:32,910 --> 00:19:33,955
Oh.

409
00:19:34,347 --> 00:19:36,000
And Jen.

410
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:39,525
Oh, great. Great.

411
00:19:39,526 --> 00:19:41,396
This is a safe space,
remember that.

412
00:19:41,397 --> 00:19:44,269
Let's talk about how you're
feeling about the impending move.

413
00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:46,053
Okay.

414
00:19:46,054 --> 00:19:49,318
Well, I'm feeling very analytical
and very objective about it.

415
00:19:50,928 --> 00:19:52,668
It's not ideal, the one thing
I can say is it's not ideal.

416
00:19:52,669 --> 00:19:54,148
Not ideal.

417
00:19:54,149 --> 00:19:56,237
But, you know, I've got
a lot of bigger fish to fry,

418
00:19:56,238 --> 00:19:58,544
I've got a lot on my plate,
I'm doing my residency.

419
00:19:58,545 --> 00:20:02,548
And I'm thinking about a lot of
just, like, big time doctor things.

420
00:20:02,549 --> 00:20:06,465
I'm feeling the exact opposite
of that, actually,

421
00:20:06,466 --> 00:20:09,511
I'm feeling
all sorts of emotions,

422
00:20:09,512 --> 00:20:12,122
I'm seeing colors,
I'm painting it out,

423
00:20:12,123 --> 00:20:14,516
I'm doing a lot
of free associating.

424
00:20:14,517 --> 00:20:16,953
- Very visual experience.
- Visual dreamwork.

425
00:20:16,954 --> 00:20:20,218
And I'm doing a lot
of late night snacking

426
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:22,263
of frozen pizzas at midnight.

427
00:20:22,264 --> 00:20:24,613
Well, what I'm doing is,

428
00:20:24,614 --> 00:20:27,312
I'm actually not
thinking about it at all.

429
00:20:27,313 --> 00:20:30,793
I'm just really present
and living in the moment.

430
00:20:30,794 --> 00:20:33,100
And kind of just,
like, going with the flow,

431
00:20:33,101 --> 00:20:37,800
whoever's around me and whatever
I'm doing, right then and there.

432
00:20:37,801 --> 00:20:40,716
This seem like an appropriate
impression of each other?

433
00:20:40,717 --> 00:20:44,024
Listen, you guys, I think you're being
too childish about this right now, okay?

434
00:20:44,025 --> 00:20:45,765
It's a serious thing.

435
00:20:45,766 --> 00:20:47,854
- It's a serious thing.
- I'm not being too childish about it.

436
00:20:47,855 --> 00:20:51,249
I'm just eating fruit roll-ups
all the time

437
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:53,512
and watching re-runs
of Full House

438
00:20:53,513 --> 00:20:55,688
and it's really comforting to me

439
00:20:55,689 --> 00:20:59,082
and going to my acting class and
then doing my acting exercises

440
00:20:59,083 --> 00:21:01,694
in the room, super loud,
even though

441
00:21:01,695 --> 00:21:03,348
other people have stuff to do.

442
00:21:03,349 --> 00:21:05,132
You know
what I think would help?

443
00:21:05,133 --> 00:21:07,569
Is if we just like,
have a big party,

444
00:21:07,570 --> 00:21:10,616
and invite a bunch
of random dudes over,

445
00:21:10,617 --> 00:21:12,618
um, that we just met
this morning,

446
00:21:12,619 --> 00:21:14,794
and like, shake things up,
you know what I mean?

447
00:21:14,795 --> 00:21:17,144
Like, who cares if there's
a hurricane on the way.

448
00:21:17,145 --> 00:21:20,321
Let's just go with our hearts
and, like, have a good time.

449
00:21:20,322 --> 00:21:23,281
Well, I care very, very much. I care
very much that there's a hurricane

450
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:26,762
on the way, and that's why I have
prepared so meticulously for it.

451
00:21:26,763 --> 00:21:29,069
And I've done nothing for it.

452
00:21:29,070 --> 00:21:31,637
I forgot to fill the tub.

453
00:21:31,638 --> 00:21:34,988
And I interrupted Zoey
when she was having a bath

454
00:21:34,989 --> 00:21:36,903
and having one moment
to herself.

455
00:21:36,904 --> 00:21:40,210
And then left the door open, which
I always do because I just forget.

456
00:21:40,211 --> 00:21:43,692
And I'm in my own world and don't
really think about other people.

457
00:21:43,693 --> 00:21:45,085
You know what?
I think we can all take a breath

458
00:21:45,086 --> 00:21:47,217
and remind ourselves
that this is a safe space...

459
00:21:47,218 --> 00:21:49,002
No, I think
we're gonna keep on going.

460
00:21:49,003 --> 00:21:51,439
It's so funny that you don't
think about other people.

461
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:53,441
- Oh, that's funny? That's funny to you?
- Yeah, that's funny.

462
00:21:53,442 --> 00:21:54,790
- Yeah.
- Why is that funny to you?

463
00:21:54,791 --> 00:21:58,359
I don't know, maybe because, um,
it's what you do?

464
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:01,101
Let's drop this, that's what
you do, Zoe, that's what you do.

465
00:22:01,102 --> 00:22:02,668
You don't think
about other people.

466
00:22:02,669 --> 00:22:04,234
What are you talking about?

467
00:22:04,235 --> 00:22:06,149
We're moving out because of you.

468
00:22:06,150 --> 00:22:08,064
I needed to do
what was best for me,

469
00:22:08,065 --> 00:22:10,110
and what was best for me
was to move out.

470
00:22:10,111 --> 00:22:12,460
And then it was up to you guys
to find another roommate.

471
00:22:12,461 --> 00:22:14,723
I didn't know that we weren't
gonna be able to keep the place

472
00:22:14,724 --> 00:22:15,898
because my name
wasn't on the lease.

473
00:22:15,899 --> 00:22:17,857
That's not my fault.

474
00:22:17,858 --> 00:22:19,162
You don't even know where you're going.
That's what's crazy about it.

475
00:22:19,163 --> 00:22:21,121
Okay, so, what,
I'm gonna stay here forever?

476
00:22:21,122 --> 00:22:23,036
You could have chosen
a better time.

477
00:22:23,037 --> 00:22:24,951
That's what I mean,
it's not fair.

478
00:22:24,952 --> 00:22:27,606
I know that
we're not 22 anymore.

479
00:22:27,607 --> 00:22:29,347
- Do you?
- Yes, I do.

480
00:22:29,348 --> 00:22:30,652
It's like, what do
you want me to do?

481
00:22:30,653 --> 00:22:32,741
I can't even afford
to live somewhere else.

482
00:22:32,742 --> 00:22:33,873
That's not my fault.

483
00:22:33,874 --> 00:22:36,311
You are the one causing
all of this!

484
00:22:37,181 --> 00:22:39,140
You are the hurricane!

485
00:23:02,642 --> 00:23:04,034
Sorry, you guys.

486
00:23:06,036 --> 00:23:07,385
- Everyone okay?
- Yeah.

487
00:23:07,386 --> 00:23:09,299
Okay, yeah.

488
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:11,519
That was such a stupid
idea, I'm so sorry.

489
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,565
- That's okay.
- So, would this be a bad time

490
00:23:13,566 --> 00:23:15,437
to offer a business opportunity?

491
00:23:17,613 --> 00:23:19,527
Yes, this would be
the worst time.

492
00:23:19,528 --> 00:23:21,660
I think I need a drink.
Thank you.

493
00:23:21,661 --> 00:23:22,879
Yeah, I'll have some wine.

494
00:23:32,846 --> 00:23:34,717
People might be dying tonight.

495
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:38,981
If we die tonight,
what would you wish

496
00:23:38,982 --> 00:23:41,201
you'd gotten off your chest.

497
00:23:41,202 --> 00:23:43,204
That's what's going through
my mind right now.

498
00:23:50,994 --> 00:23:52,692
It's so funny that you would

499
00:23:53,954 --> 00:23:54,955
say that.

500
00:23:55,825 --> 00:23:57,087
Um...

501
00:24:00,917 --> 00:24:01,918
Okay.

502
00:24:04,138 --> 00:24:05,922
So, I got a message.

503
00:24:08,882 --> 00:24:10,622
I don't even really know
when I got it

504
00:24:10,623 --> 00:24:12,581
'cause it was just sitting there
in my inbox.

505
00:24:13,539 --> 00:24:14,540
Okay, so...

506
00:24:15,192 --> 00:24:16,889
backstory.

507
00:24:16,890 --> 00:24:19,413
My sophomore year of high school,
I had Miss Keane for math.

508
00:24:19,414 --> 00:24:22,068
She was really cute,

509
00:24:22,069 --> 00:24:23,896
like she was super smiley

510
00:24:23,897 --> 00:24:27,116
and happy and
I wanted to impress her.

511
00:24:27,117 --> 00:24:30,032
So, I studied really hard
and I got pretty good at math.

512
00:24:30,033 --> 00:24:32,208
And then I found out that
she was the assistant coach

513
00:24:32,209 --> 00:24:33,514
for the basketball team,

514
00:24:33,515 --> 00:24:35,075
so then I got pretty good
at basketball.

515
00:24:36,039 --> 00:24:37,562
I'd say, "God,

516
00:24:37,563 --> 00:24:38,694
"if this shot goes in,

517
00:24:40,130 --> 00:24:43,002
"the next time
we have a math test,

518
00:24:43,003 --> 00:24:46,179
"Miss Keane is gonna look up and I'm
gonna look up when it's all quiet

519
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:48,050
"in the classroom.

520
00:24:48,051 --> 00:24:49,662
"We're just gonna look
at each other."

521
00:24:50,576 --> 00:24:51,968
Whoosh. Swish.

522
00:24:53,143 --> 00:24:55,581
She used to drive me home
after practice.

523
00:24:57,844 --> 00:25:00,193
And I would just sit there
in the car...

524
00:25:00,194 --> 00:25:02,370
She kissed me
for the first time in the car.

525
00:25:05,547 --> 00:25:09,507
I know that we were together,

526
00:25:09,508 --> 00:25:11,683
but I don't remember it like...

527
00:25:11,684 --> 00:25:16,514
going to get ice cream or going to dinner.
I don't remember anything.

528
00:25:16,515 --> 00:25:20,735
I just remember breaking up
and her moving schools and

529
00:25:20,736 --> 00:25:22,477
not knowing where she was
and just never...

530
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:26,829
seeing her again.

531
00:25:28,135 --> 00:25:31,530
But she wrote me this message.

532
00:25:35,708 --> 00:25:37,318
She's uh...

533
00:25:38,449 --> 00:25:39,842
She's married. So...

534
00:25:41,104 --> 00:25:43,542
She's not Ms. Keane anymore.

535
00:25:45,456 --> 00:25:47,067
And...

536
00:25:49,069 --> 00:25:52,551
I am so glad that
I'm not 15 anymore.

537
00:26:02,299 --> 00:26:03,735
May I have some of that?

538
00:26:03,736 --> 00:26:05,912
See if you're next.

539
00:26:06,608 --> 00:26:07,609
Thanks.

540
00:26:12,745 --> 00:26:14,007
Okay.

541
00:26:18,098 --> 00:26:23,406
Um, I guess not many
people know this, and...

542
00:26:23,407 --> 00:26:28,194
Of course, none of you guys would know
this, but when I was in my early 20s,

543
00:26:28,195 --> 00:26:30,631
I was going to get married.

544
00:26:30,632 --> 00:26:33,896
And a week before
I was meant to get married,

545
00:26:34,636 --> 00:26:36,333
I walked away.

546
00:26:37,726 --> 00:26:41,207
Um,

547
00:26:41,208 --> 00:26:45,341
I felt like I hadn't. I hadn't adventured.
I hadn't seen the world.

548
00:26:45,342 --> 00:26:48,389
I hadn't made mistakes...

549
00:26:49,695 --> 00:26:51,044
and my fiancee,

550
00:26:53,873 --> 00:26:56,439
Elizabeth,

551
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:59,618
who was a childhood friend,
a childhood sweetheart, I guess,

552
00:27:03,317 --> 00:27:05,711
she didn't deserve
that uncertainty.

553
00:27:06,842 --> 00:27:09,322
And I just wish... I wish

554
00:27:09,323 --> 00:27:12,107
I had been better for her

555
00:27:12,108 --> 00:27:15,372
and that I had the courage,
I had had the balls...

556
00:27:16,983 --> 00:27:18,462
to, to...

557
00:27:21,552 --> 00:27:24,555
to not put her through that.

558
00:27:28,081 --> 00:27:32,998
But then the stupid thing was was that
I just ended up working for my dad,

559
00:27:32,999 --> 00:27:34,565
going into the family business,

560
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:39,658
and I didn't even
fulfill my promise.

561
00:27:44,053 --> 00:27:47,709
I mean, I'm trying to,
I'm trying to now. I'm trying.

562
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:57,371
Had I known I was gonna to be
in this situation earlier,

563
00:27:59,982 --> 00:28:04,769
I was kinda lost as a kid,
you know, um...

564
00:28:04,770 --> 00:28:12,124
My biological father was gone, so my
mom remarried, and she had these...

565
00:28:12,125 --> 00:28:15,605
I was... these two sisters,
kind of insta sisters, stepsisters.

566
00:28:15,606 --> 00:28:17,565
And...

567
00:28:19,349 --> 00:28:21,481
for about...

568
00:28:21,482 --> 00:28:22,744
that was about two years...

569
00:28:24,050 --> 00:28:26,573
when they were out of the house,

570
00:28:26,574 --> 00:28:31,057
I would dress up in
their clothes by myself.

571
00:28:33,146 --> 00:28:35,060
I created this...

572
00:28:35,061 --> 00:28:42,068
I guess it was some kind of alter ego,
or I don't know if it was like this

573
00:28:43,504 --> 00:28:45,723
grandmother that I never had,

574
00:28:45,724 --> 00:28:49,815
who was sort of a father figure
who made me feel

575
00:28:52,774 --> 00:28:55,428
like I belonged to something.

576
00:28:55,429 --> 00:28:59,520
Her name was Sophia
and I would dress up,

577
00:29:00,913 --> 00:29:04,046
and... and become Sophia.

578
00:29:07,702 --> 00:29:10,617
I never told you this because
you'd probably think I was crazy,

579
00:29:10,618 --> 00:29:17,580
but Sophia just kept me
grounded for a while when

580
00:29:17,581 --> 00:29:18,887
I didn't know who I was.

581
00:29:20,584 --> 00:29:22,108
Feels good to say that.

582
00:29:23,849 --> 00:29:25,633
Congratulations.

583
00:29:27,896 --> 00:29:30,115
I feel like you need
to wear the bella.

584
00:29:30,116 --> 00:29:32,379
Can you please give me the bella?
I was waiting for that.

585
00:29:34,424 --> 00:29:36,512
There you go. It's a start.

586
00:29:36,513 --> 00:29:37,644
Yeah.

587
00:29:37,645 --> 00:29:39,734
Uh...

588
00:29:41,823 --> 00:29:44,129
Um...

589
00:29:44,130 --> 00:29:47,523
I don't know any of you guys.
You're all strangers.

590
00:29:47,524 --> 00:29:50,527
I guess that's appropriate.

591
00:29:52,442 --> 00:29:56,358
I moved here
to go to business school,

592
00:29:56,359 --> 00:29:59,535
and I got a scholarship that
first year, and it was great.

593
00:29:59,536 --> 00:30:02,495
And I was like killing it.
It was awesome.

594
00:30:02,496 --> 00:30:08,762
And I met a lot
of interesting people

595
00:30:08,763 --> 00:30:13,854
and, uh, started getting to know,
like, the business world out here,

596
00:30:13,855 --> 00:30:17,466
and I got a great internship
at a great financial firm.

597
00:30:17,467 --> 00:30:18,859
That's what I do.

598
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:21,557
Um, but...

599
00:30:21,558 --> 00:30:25,431
then I kind of got swept
in a different direction.

600
00:30:25,432 --> 00:30:31,306
Um, I went on a trip with a bunch
of people that I was interning with.

601
00:30:31,307 --> 00:30:36,050
This girl, and these
older trader guys,

602
00:30:36,051 --> 00:30:38,400
and they're like, "We're gonna
go away for the weekend."

603
00:30:38,401 --> 00:30:44,667
Um, I mean, just ended up like
this island, um, in the Bahamas.

604
00:30:44,668 --> 00:30:48,933
And I was like, "What? This is
crazy, you know?" And then...

605
00:30:48,934 --> 00:30:54,939
At the end of the trip,
um, they paid me and the girl,

606
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:59,726
and I was like, "You don't have to do that.
We were just, like, on a trip."

607
00:30:59,727 --> 00:31:06,385
And they're like, "No it's... We know
you're like, struggling in school."

608
00:31:06,386 --> 00:31:11,390
So it's been going on for a few years,
and it's how I've made a living.

609
00:31:11,391 --> 00:31:16,003
I realize, like all these people
that I'm meeting and doing this

610
00:31:16,004 --> 00:31:18,179
with "providing"

611
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:21,617
who are just people
who want to, like, connect

612
00:31:21,618 --> 00:31:24,403
and like, not be alone
in the world,

613
00:31:24,404 --> 00:31:28,321
and I find that
I'm just alone, um,

614
00:31:29,931 --> 00:31:32,151
when I get home because

615
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:39,505
I've kind of chosen this life
that's like, an easy way to

616
00:31:39,506 --> 00:31:46,033
make a buck. And I kind of feel like I
have to be pretty closed off to not, like,

617
00:31:46,034 --> 00:31:52,518
fall for anybody or whatever. I guess
I'm sharing all this with you because

618
00:31:52,519 --> 00:31:59,264
I think I am ready to end that chapter
of my life and start a new chapter

619
00:31:59,265 --> 00:32:03,050
where I am truly, like, connecting
and finding someone that

620
00:32:03,051 --> 00:32:04,747
I wanna be with.

621
00:32:04,748 --> 00:32:09,187
And start a family, so...

622
00:32:09,188 --> 00:32:11,319
I know we're here
for our first date.

623
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:13,669
I know you didn't know
any of this.

624
00:32:13,670 --> 00:32:15,368
Uh, there's that.

625
00:32:16,282 --> 00:32:18,544
That's a lot.

626
00:32:18,545 --> 00:32:20,111
Can I borrow
some of your clothes?

627
00:32:20,112 --> 00:32:23,114
Yeah. I know
I have great clothes.

628
00:32:23,115 --> 00:32:25,987
It's crazy.
I'm gonna miss that part.

629
00:32:29,121 --> 00:32:30,861
Okay. Do I have to go?

630
00:32:35,214 --> 00:32:38,913
Halloween and, like, this
time of year is always

631
00:32:40,610 --> 00:32:42,308
feels a little weird for me.

632
00:32:44,266 --> 00:32:48,879
So when I was in college,
I had, um, a boyfriend

633
00:32:50,142 --> 00:32:55,407
who I really thought
I was going to marry.

634
00:32:55,408 --> 00:33:02,501
Um and we... We wrote music
together and played guitar,

635
00:33:02,502 --> 00:33:06,984
and our songs were really stupid,
but they were also kind of good,

636
00:33:06,985 --> 00:33:11,553
and people would like them and
we'd have these little concerts.

637
00:33:11,554 --> 00:33:15,775
Um, one night we were
at our friend's Halloween party

638
00:33:15,776 --> 00:33:21,346
and we came back home
and we were both really drunk.

639
00:33:21,347 --> 00:33:28,179
We were, like, in our bedroom. And,
um, things just started to happen,

640
00:33:28,180 --> 00:33:32,357
and I just felt
a little too drunk.

641
00:33:32,358 --> 00:33:35,708
But he just kept going,
and I was saying no and,

642
00:33:35,709 --> 00:33:42,628
but then it just kind of happened.
And, um, the next morning,

643
00:33:42,629 --> 00:33:45,458
you know, we both
laughed about it.

644
00:33:47,373 --> 00:33:49,984
He apologized for what happened,

645
00:33:53,031 --> 00:33:55,641
but, um,

646
00:33:55,642 --> 00:34:02,170
it happened again
and happened a lot of times.

647
00:34:03,476 --> 00:34:07,610
I just kept justifying it
to myself, and

648
00:34:08,524 --> 00:34:09,916
he'd apologize.

649
00:34:09,917 --> 00:34:11,962
And I just keep

650
00:34:13,877 --> 00:34:20,709
making excuses for him
because I loved him so much.

651
00:34:20,710 --> 00:34:28,108
But every time that it happened,
I felt like a little part of me,

652
00:34:28,109 --> 00:34:34,332
like, my power wasn't...
It was diminishing, And I...

653
00:34:34,333 --> 00:34:36,813
I didn't call the police
or I didn't do anything.

654
00:34:37,423 --> 00:34:39,902
And then, um,

655
00:34:39,903 --> 00:34:45,213
about a year later, I found that
he was texting this other girl

656
00:34:46,475 --> 00:34:48,086
and he moved out.

657
00:34:50,653 --> 00:34:56,702
It took me a lot of years
and therapy to realize

658
00:34:56,703 --> 00:34:59,749
that what was happening to me
wasn't okay.

659
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:02,404
I found out, um,

660
00:35:04,232 --> 00:35:09,018
that that next girlfriend
that he had, um,

661
00:35:09,019 --> 00:35:10,891
the same thing happened to her.

662
00:35:14,590 --> 00:35:16,897
And I just wish that I had

663
00:35:19,552 --> 00:35:21,206
said something.

664
00:35:27,777 --> 00:35:29,301
Oh, sorry.

665
00:35:31,781 --> 00:35:34,480
A plus...

666
00:35:50,017 --> 00:35:51,584
It feels good to laugh.

667
00:35:56,415 --> 00:35:57,458
Your turn.

668
00:35:57,459 --> 00:35:59,113
Oh, wow. Okay.

669
00:36:03,248 --> 00:36:07,207
So some of you guys know I
moved here about three years ago

670
00:36:07,208 --> 00:36:10,515
and it was really scary.

671
00:36:10,516 --> 00:36:11,690
I didn't know anyone.

672
00:36:11,691 --> 00:36:14,040
Um, and,

673
00:36:14,041 --> 00:36:19,480
it was kind of an intimidating
place to feel alone. Uh...

674
00:36:19,481 --> 00:36:23,093
But I met some amazing people
who took me in.

675
00:36:24,747 --> 00:36:26,358
Suddenly, it kind of went from

676
00:36:27,707 --> 00:36:31,840
being this unfamiliar,
scary place to...

677
00:36:31,841 --> 00:36:33,625
To home.

678
00:36:33,626 --> 00:36:35,845
And, that realization was

679
00:36:37,369 --> 00:36:39,457
pretty amazing for me.

680
00:36:39,458 --> 00:36:45,333
But there was one person I met
who I knew pretty quickly that

681
00:36:46,943 --> 00:36:50,164
I didn't just wanna be friends
with them. Um...

682
00:36:51,774 --> 00:36:54,907
I felt something more. Um...

683
00:36:54,908 --> 00:36:57,998
But I was terrified
to say anything. Um...

684
00:37:01,306 --> 00:37:05,004
But there's something that I
admire so much in this person.

685
00:37:05,005 --> 00:37:08,660
This comfort in being themselves
kind of inspires me and,

686
00:37:08,661 --> 00:37:12,012
I guess this is the night
with an unpredictable end. Um...

687
00:37:14,232 --> 00:37:16,234
And I feel like

688
00:37:17,757 --> 00:37:20,106
maybe now

689
00:37:20,107 --> 00:37:24,938
would be the time that I...
That I let them know how I feel.

690
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:54,401
I...

691
00:37:54,402 --> 00:37:57,535
Is it Ryan? Yeah.

692
00:37:57,536 --> 00:37:58,841
You wish.

693
00:38:05,108 --> 00:38:06,762
Yeah, sorry.

694
00:38:09,983 --> 00:38:12,246
It's just like that,
it's so nice.

695
00:38:16,555 --> 00:38:21,689
I don't really feel like,
honestly, I'm listening to that.

696
00:38:21,690 --> 00:38:24,562
And it's like
I'm listening to it.

697
00:38:24,563 --> 00:38:30,132
I'm like, he's talking about me?
I'm like...

698
00:38:30,133 --> 00:38:33,005
Hoping, you know, that you were.

699
00:38:33,006 --> 00:38:35,181
There's still
just a part of me that's like,

700
00:38:35,182 --> 00:38:36,878
"Couldn't be, couldn't be you."

701
00:38:36,879 --> 00:38:39,273
I just feel really unworthy.

702
00:38:41,275 --> 00:38:42,493
Already nervous,

703
00:38:42,494 --> 00:38:45,104
but was great
going around the circle.

704
00:38:45,105 --> 00:38:49,631
Like, what are you going to say? Like all of
these things are so important, so big and...

705
00:38:52,852 --> 00:38:55,289
like, what do you
have to contribute to share?

706
00:38:57,944 --> 00:39:03,645
I just felt like anything that I
have to say would be inadequate.

707
00:39:06,866 --> 00:39:09,302
And I spent, um,

708
00:39:09,303 --> 00:39:11,697
I spent a lot of time
feeling inadequate,

709
00:39:14,874 --> 00:39:16,658
just so dumb because

710
00:39:18,486 --> 00:39:22,316
I'm pursuing this thing
where it's like you need to

711
00:39:23,839 --> 00:39:25,841
believe that you

712
00:39:27,147 --> 00:39:30,149
are enough,
are more than enough.

713
00:39:30,150 --> 00:39:33,326
And I'm supposed to be,
like, so confident.

714
00:39:33,327 --> 00:39:38,026
I know I come off that way but it's like
a lot of times when I feel insecure,

715
00:39:38,027 --> 00:39:40,116
I just get louder.

716
00:39:41,509 --> 00:39:43,510
Um,

717
00:39:43,511 --> 00:39:48,385
my friends from high school be
like, "Oh my God, you're so brave.

718
00:39:48,386 --> 00:39:51,693
"You're so brave for going after
what you really want."

719
00:39:52,781 --> 00:39:55,217
And it's like,

720
00:39:55,218 --> 00:39:58,656
I feel like I'm just going
through the motions of, you know,

721
00:39:58,657 --> 00:40:01,006
taking odd jobs,
like making ends meet,

722
00:40:01,007 --> 00:40:03,444
like going on auditions
and all that stuff. That's like,

723
00:40:05,533 --> 00:40:07,316
it's like, that's the easy part.

724
00:40:07,317 --> 00:40:12,626
And what is much harder is

725
00:40:12,627 --> 00:40:14,368
actually thinking
that you deserve it.

726
00:40:17,589 --> 00:40:21,984
And I just don't feel that way.
I just don't feel that way.

727
00:40:23,725 --> 00:40:25,640
Maybe you guys
are gonna kiss or what?

728
00:40:31,646 --> 00:40:35,606
It's the last time
I hang out with you guys.

729
00:40:35,607 --> 00:40:37,826
Fucking storm, now this.

730
00:40:40,394 --> 00:40:44,354
I'm perfect. So...

731
00:40:46,313 --> 00:40:49,011
I'm not perfect.

732
00:40:51,100 --> 00:40:56,976
I had a friend in college and
we were friends for a long time.

733
00:40:58,151 --> 00:41:01,067
We ended up hooking up and

734
00:41:02,808 --> 00:41:08,683
she got pregnant, and um...

735
00:41:11,338 --> 00:41:15,821
I didn't show up for her.

736
00:41:19,825 --> 00:41:21,827
I sent money.

737
00:41:24,046 --> 00:41:26,570
I feel like

738
00:41:26,571 --> 00:41:31,619
my absence that day
was really violent.

739
00:41:33,969 --> 00:41:37,668
I always ask
why I'm not with anyone.

740
00:41:37,669 --> 00:41:41,194
I think I kind of blew it.

741
00:41:45,459 --> 00:41:49,071
I fuck up and that's it. That's...
That's the move that you made.

742
00:41:49,942 --> 00:41:52,248
You can't get it back.

743
00:41:58,820 --> 00:42:01,474
Tim.

744
00:42:01,475 --> 00:42:06,741
Um, okay.

745
00:42:09,657 --> 00:42:12,006
This is something that I've been
keeping from everybody,

746
00:42:12,007 --> 00:42:16,097
but, um, mostly from Joe.

747
00:42:16,098 --> 00:42:19,798
A couple weeks ago,
I started looking at rings.

748
00:42:23,149 --> 00:42:26,499
And this is not a proposal, because
I don't have a ring right now.

749
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:28,545
All right. All right.

750
00:42:28,546 --> 00:42:33,811
I just... I just wanted to let you
know the reason I don't have a ring yet

751
00:42:33,812 --> 00:42:38,424
is because I wanted to use
my grandfather's ring.

752
00:42:38,425 --> 00:42:43,037
And when I asked my grandma
if I could use it,

753
00:42:43,038 --> 00:42:45,910
she wouldn't give it to me.

754
00:42:45,911 --> 00:42:50,568
Shit. She said no.

755
00:42:52,831 --> 00:42:55,876
I love her
and I know she loves me.

756
00:42:55,877 --> 00:42:59,924
And sometimes,
you told me this, actually,

757
00:42:59,925 --> 00:43:03,972
sometimes when you love someone,
you have to let them go.

758
00:43:06,061 --> 00:43:08,323
I don't think we need a ring.

759
00:43:08,324 --> 00:43:10,456
- I know you would like a ring.
- I would love a ring.

760
00:43:10,457 --> 00:43:14,329
It'd look great. You would look
great with the ring.

761
00:43:14,330 --> 00:43:17,768
So I'm glad that
we can start talking about

762
00:43:17,769 --> 00:43:19,945
our future together.

763
00:43:26,386 --> 00:43:30,128
- I love you.
- I love you. Plenty of time.

764
00:43:30,129 --> 00:43:33,049
I'm gonna be such a bridezilla, but,
like, nice, I'll be a nice bridezilla.

765
00:43:37,571 --> 00:43:42,227
So you guys, most of you know that I
come from a pretty well-to-do family.

766
00:43:42,228 --> 00:43:46,187
I'm Joseph the third.

767
00:43:46,188 --> 00:43:49,364
My mom's a doctor.
Dad's a lawyer, so...

768
00:43:49,365 --> 00:43:52,498
but they were also very, pretty liberal.
Like I never had to come out.

769
00:43:52,499 --> 00:43:54,979
Like my mom's brother's gay, My
dad's best friend's a lesbian.

770
00:43:54,980 --> 00:43:56,502
So it was never a thing like...

771
00:43:56,503 --> 00:43:58,678
When I was eight, my mom
took me to a Cher concert.

772
00:43:58,679 --> 00:44:00,767
She was like,
" I knew you'd like it."

773
00:44:00,768 --> 00:44:05,032
Um, so I was always, like, you know,
it was a good house to grow up in.

774
00:44:05,033 --> 00:44:09,602
I think the trap, if anything,
for me and my sister was

775
00:44:09,603 --> 00:44:11,473
that we had successful parents,

776
00:44:11,474 --> 00:44:16,870
uh, we had black, successful parents,
like an Upper East Side family

777
00:44:16,871 --> 00:44:19,786
of color.
Like that's a lot of pressure,

778
00:44:19,787 --> 00:44:22,833
like, you do not come home
with anything less than an A.

779
00:44:22,834 --> 00:44:27,838
So I think that weighed on Natasha and I.
We just became best friends

780
00:44:27,839 --> 00:44:30,057
because we had that in common.

781
00:44:30,058 --> 00:44:34,279
But that success thing
was really an issue.

782
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:37,499
I mean we were in college. I was
a sophomore. She was a senior.

783
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:43,723
She started taking Adderall,
um, and then pain meds,

784
00:44:43,724 --> 00:44:47,380
and then cocaine and

785
00:44:49,730 --> 00:44:54,603
barely graduated college like in
and out of rehab all of a sudden and

786
00:44:54,604 --> 00:44:59,434
overdosed like four times and...

787
00:44:59,435 --> 00:45:05,353
It was a lot, and, you know, my
big sister just kind of changed.

788
00:45:05,354 --> 00:45:09,706
She shifted. One minute, it's like,
"I'm sorry. I want to be better.

789
00:45:09,707 --> 00:45:13,927
"I'm gonna do better. I'm just..."
and then the next minute it's...

790
00:45:13,928 --> 00:45:16,321
She's lying and she...

791
00:45:16,322 --> 00:45:19,628
She's breaking into Mom and Dad's.
She's breaking into my place.

792
00:45:19,629 --> 00:45:23,763
She's stealing. And the 17th
time she went into rehab,

793
00:45:23,764 --> 00:45:27,114
my mother was like,
"Listen, this is it.

794
00:45:27,115 --> 00:45:34,078
"Like it either sticks or we're done. We
can't... We can't do this with you anymore."

795
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:39,039
And then she disappeared.

796
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:43,478
At this point, I'm in grad school.
We moved in with each other.

797
00:45:43,479 --> 00:45:50,050
Had a job. We're talking about starting
our business and she shows up at my door.

798
00:45:50,051 --> 00:45:58,051
Ninety pounds, unrecognizable, talking
about she's hungry, needs money for food.

799
00:45:58,190 --> 00:46:04,499
And I'm... It's like we grew up in the same
house, you know, like we had the same parents,

800
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:09,069
the same opportunities.
Like what? What?

801
00:46:09,070 --> 00:46:11,680
So you know, I did what
you're not supposed to do.

802
00:46:11,681 --> 00:46:16,512
I gave her money, just like
get out of my face.

803
00:46:18,819 --> 00:46:23,083
And a week later, she overdosed
for the fifth time,

804
00:46:23,084 --> 00:46:29,874
and she didn't survive,
and I felt happy

805
00:46:31,571 --> 00:46:33,703
it was over, you know, like,

806
00:46:36,924 --> 00:46:40,493
she was out of pain,
sure, but my mom...

807
00:46:41,842 --> 00:46:45,454
Oh, sorry.

808
00:46:58,250 --> 00:47:03,123
Oh, God. Now everyone's looking at me.
I'm last.

809
00:47:03,124 --> 00:47:08,913
Hold on... liquid courage.

810
00:47:12,786 --> 00:47:17,746
I don't have like
a big confession.

811
00:47:17,747 --> 00:47:24,275
So much is like no one ever
asks me how I'm doing.

812
00:47:24,276 --> 00:47:26,625
I don't know.
This is a stupid story.

813
00:47:26,626 --> 00:47:32,153
Um, when I was younger.

814
00:47:34,590 --> 00:47:36,679
- Hello?
- Come in.

815
00:47:39,378 --> 00:47:41,119
Hey. Hello.

816
00:47:42,772 --> 00:47:45,209
Come in, come in.
This is our neighbor.

817
00:47:45,210 --> 00:47:47,515
- I'm sorry. She's so ruffled.
- She's so scared.

818
00:47:47,516 --> 00:47:49,169
I've been baking all day.

819
00:47:49,170 --> 00:47:51,693
I heard you guys have people here.
I just wanted to try this.

820
00:47:51,694 --> 00:47:54,522
Yeah, we heard that it's kind
of like a meeting here. A party.

821
00:47:54,523 --> 00:47:56,960
- Yeah.
- And we thought we can join you guys.

822
00:47:56,961 --> 00:47:58,876
Please come in.

823
00:48:02,009 --> 00:48:05,098
Okay, do you wanna come
in my room where you can settle?

824
00:48:05,099 --> 00:48:08,493
A cute story.

825
00:48:08,494 --> 00:48:10,712
- Thank you for being this...
- I'm Josh.

826
00:48:10,713 --> 00:48:12,410
- Hi, Josh. I'm Alex. Nice to meet you.
- Hey, you too.

827
00:48:12,411 --> 00:48:14,194
- Are those butter walnut cookies?
- Yes.

828
00:48:14,195 --> 00:48:18,198
- Oh, look at these.
- I thought I smelled those. Oh, my God.

829
00:48:18,199 --> 00:48:20,679
- Oh, yeah.
- You made these?

830
00:48:20,680 --> 00:48:24,118
Alex is a chef. He's like,
got his finger on them.

831
00:48:26,033 --> 00:48:27,120
Are you guys hungry?

832
00:48:27,121 --> 00:48:29,035
- Yes.
- Yeah?

833
00:48:29,036 --> 00:48:32,125
All right. I've been trying stuff
out all day, it's for the new menu.

834
00:48:32,126 --> 00:48:33,822
- You want food?
- Yeah!

835
00:48:33,823 --> 00:48:36,087
- Are you serious?
- Yeah. I'll be right back.

836
00:48:38,698 --> 00:48:41,396
All right, guys.

837
00:48:44,704 --> 00:48:46,879
This is
a garlic roasted chicken.

838
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:50,361
Some Artisan flatbread.

839
00:48:50,362 --> 00:48:52,451
And this one's honey
and some ice.

840
00:49:24,396 --> 00:49:28,617
You hear that, right?

841
00:49:31,838 --> 00:49:33,621
Oh, my gosh.
It's our neighbors.

842
00:49:33,622 --> 00:49:35,319
- Downstairs, yeah.
- Downstairs.

843
00:49:35,320 --> 00:49:37,235
She was an opera singer
or something.

844
00:49:38,410 --> 00:49:40,367
Oh. Does she go to church?

845
00:49:40,368 --> 00:49:43,284
- Let's see if they're all right.
- I'll go check on them.

846
00:49:45,112 --> 00:49:48,375
Oh, we're good. We just heard
you singing through the floor.

847
00:49:48,376 --> 00:49:52,031
- Oh, no. Were we too loud?
- No. No.

848
00:49:52,032 --> 00:49:55,600
- Please do.
- Oh, we have plenty of food and water

849
00:49:55,601 --> 00:49:58,429
- and warmth and candles upstairs.
- We're not starving but,

850
00:49:58,430 --> 00:49:59,996
I'm really packed full.

851
00:49:59,997 --> 00:50:01,519
You guys should come up.

852
00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:02,737
- Really?
- Yes.

853
00:50:02,738 --> 00:50:04,391
I could go recruit some people.

854
00:50:04,392 --> 00:50:06,132
We could get you up there,
if you want.

855
00:50:06,133 --> 00:50:08,265
Yes, yeah.
We could absolutely...

856
00:50:08,266 --> 00:50:10,137
We have some
strapping young men.

857
00:50:21,583 --> 00:50:24,020
May I present
Mrs. Barbara Hirsch?

858
00:50:24,021 --> 00:50:25,891
- Hi!
- Nice looking group.

859
00:50:25,892 --> 00:50:28,198
I think so. I think so.

860
00:50:28,199 --> 00:50:30,635
- Oh, guys, this is...
- Mr. Hirsch.

861
00:50:30,636 --> 00:50:32,419
- Hi.
- Hello.

862
00:50:32,420 --> 00:50:34,031
- Nice to meet you.
- My goodness.

863
00:50:35,728 --> 00:50:36,815
Hey, guys.

864
00:50:36,816 --> 00:50:38,077
- Hi.
- Hi.

865
00:50:38,078 --> 00:50:39,774
Damien, this is
my daughter, Olivia.

866
00:50:39,775 --> 00:50:41,863
We heard the
Hirsch's moving around,

867
00:50:41,864 --> 00:50:43,126
and then we just followed

868
00:50:43,127 --> 00:50:45,346
the sound of fun.

869
00:50:52,353 --> 00:50:53,962
I think they called it

870
00:50:53,963 --> 00:50:57,096
The Great Northeast Blackout

871
00:50:57,097 --> 00:50:58,837
- in 1965.
- Yeah, in '65.

872
00:50:58,838 --> 00:51:00,404
I was working with...

873
00:51:00,405 --> 00:51:03,407
Yeah, but you know,
it wasn't really that scary.

874
00:51:03,408 --> 00:51:06,019
I think they called it
"The Season of Love."

875
00:51:07,107 --> 00:51:09,065
Flower power children. It was...

876
00:51:09,066 --> 00:51:11,110
Wild, young woman,
before I knew her.

877
00:51:11,111 --> 00:51:13,244
Well, I wasn't indulgent.

878
00:51:16,638 --> 00:51:18,552
And then, I think
the next one...

879
00:51:18,553 --> 00:51:22,121
- '77.
- 1977. Wow.

880
00:51:22,122 --> 00:51:23,644
She was in...

881
00:51:23,645 --> 00:51:26,778
- Bubbling Brown Sugar.
- Bubbling Brown Sugar, and uh...

882
00:51:26,779 --> 00:51:29,128
This is
going to be my first night

883
00:51:29,129 --> 00:51:31,130
on as the lead...
and the lights went out.

884
00:51:31,131 --> 00:51:33,045
So, we just had to be there.

885
00:51:33,046 --> 00:51:36,744
About second act,
it went black at 9:30.

886
00:51:36,745 --> 00:51:40,096
We had to walk home, you know,
all the way from 52nd Street.

887
00:51:40,097 --> 00:51:41,619
Kind of romantic.

888
00:51:41,620 --> 00:51:43,882
It was romantic.

889
00:51:43,883 --> 00:51:46,189
- We're just so happy to be here.
- Yeah.

890
00:51:46,190 --> 00:51:48,105
Thank you for inviting us.

891
00:51:49,323 --> 00:51:51,063
I've never been to a party

892
00:51:51,064 --> 00:51:53,153
in a long time.

893
00:52:06,123 --> 00:52:07,907
Take this piece...

894
00:52:10,823 --> 00:52:11,867
Look...

895
00:52:14,522 --> 00:52:16,697
Can you see them?

896
00:52:16,698 --> 00:52:18,438
You see all of them?

897
00:52:18,439 --> 00:52:22,138
It was in '80s,
and I was on my way home,

898
00:52:22,139 --> 00:52:25,706
walking through
Washington Square Park

899
00:52:25,707 --> 00:52:28,100
and a young man approached me,

900
00:52:28,101 --> 00:52:31,843
and he was asking for money
to buy food, and...

901
00:52:31,844 --> 00:52:33,975
I said, "No, I'm not
giving you any money."

902
00:52:33,976 --> 00:52:37,153
Come home with me.
I'll fix you a hot meal.

903
00:52:37,154 --> 00:52:42,549
And he sat at the kitchen table,
and he started sketching.

904
00:52:42,550 --> 00:52:44,726
It was so beautiful. It was...

905
00:52:46,424 --> 00:52:48,686
It took my breath away.

906
00:52:48,687 --> 00:52:52,343
And I bet you can't guess
who that young artist was.

907
00:52:53,474 --> 00:52:56,172
- When was it?
- '80s.

908
00:52:56,173 --> 00:52:59,218
Basquiat?

909
00:52:59,219 --> 00:53:01,786
He was in this building.

910
00:53:01,787 --> 00:53:03,788
- No, really?
- Yes.

911
00:53:03,789 --> 00:53:06,399
And we have one of his
works of art.

912
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:09,185
- In your apartment right now?
- Right now...

913
00:53:09,186 --> 00:53:11,056
- in my apartment.
- In your empty apartment?

914
00:53:11,057 --> 00:53:12,928
Yeah, but the door is locked.

915
00:53:14,234 --> 00:53:15,409
I love that.

916
00:53:23,069 --> 00:53:24,418
It's pretty cool, huh?

917
00:53:27,116 --> 00:53:29,161
- It's been fun.
- Yeah, it's been fun.

918
00:53:29,162 --> 00:53:30,510
I'm glad you came.

919
00:53:30,511 --> 00:53:35,036
And I think we're gonna be
really good friends.

920
00:53:35,037 --> 00:53:36,821
- Oh, no!
- I know, but...

921
00:53:36,822 --> 00:53:38,736
- Here we go.
- Hey, listen.

922
00:53:38,737 --> 00:53:41,957
Okay. I'm pretty aware
of my surroundings.

923
00:53:44,003 --> 00:53:45,396
Tonight would be the night.

924
00:53:46,266 --> 00:53:48,399
It's like, take your chance.

925
00:53:50,009 --> 00:53:52,445
- You know what I mean?
- I think...

926
00:53:52,446 --> 00:53:53,969
You guys would be cute together.

927
00:53:54,579 --> 00:53:55,667
Okay.

928
00:53:57,103 --> 00:53:58,712
- You guys get any sleep?
- I'm not.

929
00:53:58,713 --> 00:54:00,671
Sometimes, I'm come
like sleeping

930
00:54:00,672 --> 00:54:03,108
and always watching with
my other eye, you know,

931
00:54:03,109 --> 00:54:05,458
like this is close, and this is,
like, almost open.

932
00:54:05,459 --> 00:54:07,373
It gets a little easier.

933
00:54:07,374 --> 00:54:09,157
I mean, she sleeps
through the night.

934
00:54:09,158 --> 00:54:11,464
Now, I can't get her up
in the morning.

935
00:54:11,465 --> 00:54:13,727
- It goes by quick.
- Oh, my God. Yeah.

936
00:54:13,728 --> 00:54:14,860
I still remember.

937
00:54:15,339 --> 00:54:16,427
And now...

938
00:54:17,166 --> 00:54:19,343
she's a young lady.

939
00:54:21,519 --> 00:54:24,216
- You divorced or...
- No, no.

940
00:54:24,217 --> 00:54:26,000
You're wiping your face
with the boat?

941
00:54:26,001 --> 00:54:29,527
Olivia's mom, Sarah,
she passed away when, uh...

942
00:54:30,528 --> 00:54:32,659
Olivia was about Siena's age.

943
00:54:32,660 --> 00:54:34,574
- I'm so sorry about it.
- Thanks.

944
00:54:34,575 --> 00:54:37,621
If you ever need something,
you just knock the door,

945
00:54:37,622 --> 00:54:40,798
and we will be there, okay?
You come with us.

946
00:54:40,799 --> 00:54:43,148
Yeah, and she's getting
old enough to baby sit.

947
00:54:43,149 --> 00:54:44,715
So, if you guys
need to baby sit...

948
00:54:44,716 --> 00:54:46,194
- Please.
- Okay, that'll be great for us.

949
00:54:46,195 --> 00:54:47,371
- Yeah.
- It would be good.

950
00:54:50,025 --> 00:54:52,375
Four cheers.
It's nice to meet new friends.

951
00:54:52,376 --> 00:54:54,638
Yeah.

952
00:54:54,639 --> 00:54:56,422
Cheers to you.

953
00:54:56,423 --> 00:54:58,250
I'm in drink number 10.

954
00:54:58,251 --> 00:54:59,513
- Okay.
- And you?

955
00:55:00,079 --> 00:55:01,166
Go have a drink.

956
00:55:01,167 --> 00:55:02,820
You won't remember
this conversation?

957
00:55:02,821 --> 00:55:03,951
- No.
- Cool.

958
00:55:03,952 --> 00:55:05,650
- Okay.
- All right, thanks.

959
00:55:07,216 --> 00:55:08,305
Give you a hand?

960
00:55:09,393 --> 00:55:10,784
Sure.

961
00:55:10,785 --> 00:55:12,003
Cool.

962
00:55:12,004 --> 00:55:14,048
I've never actually
done dishes before.

963
00:55:14,049 --> 00:55:15,746
It's mostly the drying portion.

964
00:55:15,747 --> 00:55:17,704
Uh... perfect timing.

965
00:55:17,705 --> 00:55:19,620
Hang on.

966
00:55:20,055 --> 00:55:21,143
Classic.

967
00:55:23,145 --> 00:55:24,537
I'm sorry,

968
00:55:24,538 --> 00:55:26,845
I didn't get to hear
the rest of your story earlier.

969
00:55:31,502 --> 00:55:32,851
Do you really wanna know?

970
00:55:33,721 --> 00:55:34,809
Yeah.

971
00:55:37,725 --> 00:55:38,813
I do.

972
00:55:41,425 --> 00:55:43,208
- Hey.
- Hi, how're you doing?

973
00:55:43,209 --> 00:55:44,993
Yeah, of course.
Yeah.

974
00:55:49,041 --> 00:55:51,564
- They're so cute.
- Yeah.

975
00:55:51,565 --> 00:55:53,653
What was it like, having a baby?

976
00:55:53,654 --> 00:55:55,655
For me, it was amazing.

977
00:55:55,656 --> 00:55:59,180
It was the best experience
I had in my life.

978
00:55:59,181 --> 00:56:01,269
I had a natural birth.

979
00:56:01,270 --> 00:56:04,229
- You got a natural birth?
- Naturally, at home.

980
00:56:04,230 --> 00:56:05,883
No medication.

981
00:56:05,884 --> 00:56:07,059
Was it painful?

982
00:56:08,060 --> 00:56:10,323
Yeah, but it's not...

983
00:56:12,020 --> 00:56:14,935
pain. It's kind of strength.

984
00:56:14,936 --> 00:56:17,416
You have a lot of strength
inside of you.

985
00:56:17,417 --> 00:56:19,157
You can probably
pass that strength

986
00:56:19,158 --> 00:56:20,593
right under her.

987
00:56:20,594 --> 00:56:22,901
I hope so.

988
00:56:25,904 --> 00:56:29,820
This is a little tight.

989
00:56:29,821 --> 00:56:31,779
Thank you very much.

990
00:56:39,396 --> 00:56:40,440
All right.

991
00:56:53,453 --> 00:56:54,671
Somebody's jealous.

992
00:56:54,672 --> 00:56:56,542
I think it ties it together.

993
00:56:56,543 --> 00:56:59,240
It's perfect, especially with
the feather in your hair.

994
00:56:59,241 --> 00:57:00,808
- I know.
- Yeah.

It looks like a spaceship.

1023

It's a wedding gift,
but I've never played it.

1024
00:59:01,102 --> 00:59:02,450
- Oh!
- Let me see.

1025
00:59:02,451 --> 00:59:04,061
It looks like a spaceship.

1026
00:59:04,062 --> 00:59:06,368
You play with the ring.
You don't have to ring them.

1027

- Wow!
- Whoa!

1028
00:59:16,074 --> 00:59:19,120
The virgin.

1029
00:59:24,517 --> 00:59:26,127
That sounds cool.
Mmm.

1030
01:02:29,833 --> 01:02:32,312
I think we're gonna
take that queue as well, and...

1031
01:02:32,313 --> 01:02:34,314
- Head back home. You ready?
- I'm ready, yeah.

1032
01:02:34,315 --> 01:02:35,794
You guys wanna take this?

1033
01:02:35,795 --> 01:02:37,317
No, hang on to it for the night.

1034
01:02:37,318 --> 01:02:39,058
- Yeah?
- Okay.

1035
01:02:39,059 --> 01:02:40,320
We'll do another duet.

1036
01:02:40,321 --> 01:02:41,888
Absolutely.

1037
01:03:19,883 --> 01:03:22,841
Hello? Who's that?

1038
01:03:22,842 --> 01:03:25,670
Come in. Are you all right?

1039
01:03:25,671 --> 01:03:27,846
Amelia's water... My...
my wife, her water broke.

1040
01:03:27,847 --> 01:03:29,239
We're having a baby.

1041
01:03:29,240 --> 01:03:31,067
- Oh, my God.
- Are you kidding?

1042
01:03:31,068 --> 01:03:33,373
Her water broke hours ago.
I don't know what to do.

1043
01:03:33,374 --> 01:03:35,245
Okay, Someone...
Okay, you need Jen.

1044
01:03:35,246 --> 01:03:36,942
You guys calm down.
It's okay. Tony...

1045
01:03:36,943 --> 01:03:39,379
I tried to call 911
and there's no cabs outside,

1046
01:03:39,380 --> 01:03:41,120
- and I need help.
- Okay.

1047
01:03:41,121 --> 01:03:43,514
- I don't know what to do.
- I'm on my head.

1048
01:03:43,515 --> 01:03:47,213
- First labor takes a while.
- It's not her first labor.

1049
01:03:47,214 --> 01:03:48,999
- What?
- It's not her first labor.

1050
01:03:51,131 --> 01:03:53,611
- Wait, who else is with her?
- It's just me.

1051
01:03:53,612 --> 01:03:55,831
- Okay. Okay, Tony. Okay.
- I can help. I can help.

1052
01:03:55,832 --> 01:03:58,268
- Thank you.
- Okay. I'm gonna get Jen ready,

1053
01:03:58,269 --> 01:04:00,661
- and then we'll come down, okay?
- Okay.

1054
01:04:00,662 --> 01:04:04,100
Barbara had a home birth.
She would know what to do.

1055
01:04:04,101 --> 01:04:05,231
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1056
01:04:05,232 --> 01:04:07,451
Okay, good idea.
Yeah, go for it.

1057
01:04:07,452 --> 01:04:09,888
- Are you okay?
- I'm too drunk to do this.

1058
01:04:09,889 --> 01:04:12,064
You're not too drunk.
We'll get you some coffee.

1059
01:04:12,065 --> 01:04:14,284
We can go downstairs and get
like, the pour-over.

1060
01:04:14,285 --> 01:04:15,939
Okay, okay. Go get your stuff.

1061
01:04:17,941 --> 01:04:19,333
I don't really know what to do.

1062
01:04:24,599 --> 01:04:26,992
Towels, clean towels,
as many as possible.

1063
01:04:26,993 --> 01:04:28,994
- Look for a few towels.
- They're in the back.

1064
01:04:28,995 --> 01:04:32,171
And also, we will need some,
like, piece of plastic bag

1065
01:04:32,172 --> 01:04:33,564
- for the floor.
- Trash bags.

1066
01:04:33,565 --> 01:04:35,609
Yeah, or you know,
I saw in the bathroom

1067
01:04:35,610 --> 01:04:36,915
that you have this curtain.

1068
01:04:36,916 --> 01:04:38,917
- The shower curtain?
- Yeah.

1069
01:04:38,918 --> 01:04:40,833
We also... We'll...
maybe a bowl...

1070
01:04:41,399 --> 01:04:42,486
Like this?

1071
01:04:42,487 --> 01:04:44,096
I think that, that's the basics.

1072
01:04:44,097 --> 01:04:46,011
As clean as possible.

1073
01:04:46,012 --> 01:04:47,448
Do you need, um, like...

1074
01:04:48,319 --> 01:04:49,711
scissors or knife or...

1075
01:04:51,452 --> 01:04:53,410
Jen. Jen, what are you doing?

1076
01:04:53,411 --> 01:04:55,760
My stethoscope.
I can't find my stethoscope.

1077
01:04:55,761 --> 01:04:58,110
Okay. We're gonna find it.
We're gonna find it, okay?

1078
01:04:58,111 --> 01:05:00,547
She always take my stuff
for her acting class.

1079
01:05:00,548 --> 01:05:02,419
I don't have them.
I don't have my things.

1080
01:05:02,420 --> 01:05:03,637
She needs to go to the hospital.

1081
01:05:03,638 --> 01:05:05,248
We don't have
that option right now.

1082
01:05:05,249 --> 01:05:06,466
I don't know how to do this.

1083
01:05:06,467 --> 01:05:08,033
I have never
practically done this.

1084
01:05:08,034 --> 01:05:09,513
My rotations have never been...

1085
01:05:09,514 --> 01:05:11,210
I've never delivered
a real life baby.

1086
01:05:11,211 --> 01:05:12,995
- It's just books.
- Okay, I know, I know.

1087
01:05:12,996 --> 01:05:15,736
That's what it feels like,
but you know what to do. Right?

1088
01:05:15,737 --> 01:05:18,522
I cheated. I...

1089
01:05:18,523 --> 01:05:21,829
I cheated on a couple of exams.

1090
01:05:21,830 --> 01:05:23,136
That's what this is about...

1091
01:05:24,659 --> 01:05:25,790
Remember when I had

1092
01:05:25,791 --> 01:05:27,313
the panic attack
in the bathroom,

1093
01:05:27,314 --> 01:05:30,490
and you stayed with me
for three hours,

1094
01:05:30,491 --> 01:05:32,710
even once I got my breath back.

1095
01:05:32,711 --> 01:05:34,016
That's just common sense.

1096
01:05:34,017 --> 01:05:35,974
- Everybody would do that.
- No, they wouldn't.

1097
01:05:35,975 --> 01:05:38,281
You didn't learn that
in a book or anything.

1098
01:05:38,282 --> 01:05:40,110
That's just you.
That's who you are.

1099
01:05:41,415 --> 01:05:43,547
It doesn't matter
if you studied it or not.

1100
01:05:43,548 --> 01:05:44,983
You know what to do.

1101
01:05:44,984 --> 01:05:46,376
You always know what to do.

1102
01:05:46,377 --> 01:05:47,855
My gym bag.

1103
01:05:47,856 --> 01:05:49,597
- What?
- My gym bag. It's in my gym bag.

1104
01:05:51,686 --> 01:05:53,774
No, I don't think
you have any here.

1105
01:05:53,775 --> 01:05:55,124
- Okay.
- You guys will be okay.

1106
01:05:55,125 --> 01:05:56,560
Oh, yes. Of course.

1107
01:05:56,561 --> 01:05:57,649
Thank you.

1108
01:06:02,045 --> 01:06:04,221
- Want one?
- Yeah.

1109
01:06:13,926 --> 01:06:16,275
I'm gonna listen to
your little baby now, okay?

1110
01:06:16,276 --> 01:06:18,756
That's good. That's good.

1111
01:06:18,757 --> 01:06:20,714
You're doing good.

1112
01:06:20,715 --> 01:06:22,716
We're really close.
She's coming to meet you.

1113
01:06:22,717 --> 01:06:24,937
She's possibly doing great.

1114
01:06:27,200 --> 01:06:29,636
That's good. That's good.

1115
01:06:29,637 --> 01:06:31,988
Awesome girl. Good girl,
good girl. Bear down.

1116
01:06:35,208 --> 01:06:37,079
- You are a great pusher.
- Yeah.

1117
01:06:37,080 --> 01:06:38,906
- You're great at this.
- Yeah.

1118
01:06:38,907 --> 01:06:41,866
Bear down. Good girl,
good girl. Bear down.

1119
01:06:41,867 --> 01:06:44,477
You got this. You got this.
Nice push.

1120
01:06:44,478 --> 01:06:47,481
Nice push, Mom. Nice push.

1121
01:06:58,014 --> 01:06:59,405
Push.

1122
01:06:59,406 --> 01:07:01,494
On this next one,
I need you to do a double push.

1123
01:07:01,495 --> 01:07:02,756
You're gonna push,

1124
01:07:02,757 --> 01:07:04,541
take a little inhale
and double push, okay?

1125
01:07:04,542 --> 01:07:06,979
- Okay.
- Very good.

1126
01:07:08,154 --> 01:07:09,808
Very good.

1127
01:07:10,591 --> 01:07:11,679
Push.

1128
01:07:15,161 --> 01:07:17,468
Good Mama, push, push,
push, push.

1129
01:07:18,338 --> 01:07:20,296
Good Mama, push!

1130
01:07:20,297 --> 01:07:22,038
There she is.

1131
01:08:07,039 --> 01:08:08,084
How did it go?

1132
01:08:10,738 --> 01:08:12,391
Good.
Everything's good.

1133
01:08:12,392 --> 01:08:15,264
Everyone's good. Mom's good.

1134
01:08:15,265 --> 01:08:17,135
Baby's good.

1135
01:08:17,136 --> 01:08:18,876
They named her Ava.

1136
01:08:18,877 --> 01:08:20,225
You did?

1137
01:08:20,226 --> 01:08:23,185
Yeah, we delivered a baby.

1138
01:08:23,186 --> 01:08:25,012
She delivered a baby.

1139
01:08:25,013 --> 01:08:26,145
I'm going to bed.

1140
01:08:41,204 --> 01:08:42,901
