Family home
evening was huge in my home.

5
00:00:26,452 --> 00:00:29,037
I know most members of the
church keep it pretty chill

6
00:00:29,121 --> 00:00:31,456
with movie night or game night,

7
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:33,041
if you know Carrie Carrington,

8
00:00:33,125 --> 00:00:35,710
she has no interest in being chill.

9
00:00:35,794 --> 00:00:37,837
So we went all out.

10
00:00:37,922 --> 00:00:39,797
Like clockwork, every Monday night,

11
00:00:39,882 --> 00:00:42,217
we got together to plan our week,

12
00:00:42,301 --> 00:00:46,721
share a spiritual lesson and
of course, eat lots of treats.

13
00:00:46,805 --> 00:00:50,433
But of all those 936 Monday
nights in the first 18 years

14
00:00:50,518 --> 00:00:52,894
of my life, there was one lesson

15
00:00:52,978 --> 00:00:56,356
that stuck out to me the
most, eternal marriage.

16
00:00:57,858 --> 00:00:59,108
My friends from school used

17
00:00:59,193 --> 00:01:02,403
to ask, why our temples
look like Disney castle?

18
00:01:02,488 --> 00:01:03,238
What can I say?

19
00:01:03,322 --> 00:01:05,990
Members of The Church of Jesus
Christ of Latter-day Saints

20
00:01:06,075 --> 00:01:08,826
are obsessed with marriage
in a good way of course.

21
00:01:08,911 --> 00:01:10,203
I don't know what made
me more nervous,

22
00:01:10,287 --> 00:01:11,246
getting down on one knee

23
00:01:11,330 --> 00:01:13,748
or asking grandpa Robert
for permission.

24
00:01:13,832 --> 00:01:15,708
Oh come on, it
wasn't that bad.

25
00:01:15,793 --> 00:01:17,001
I couldn't get him alone.

26
00:01:17,086 --> 00:01:21,089
And then one day, I had him
cornered while shoveling snow

27
00:01:21,173 --> 00:01:24,717
and instantly like a
switch, my lips went numb.

28
00:01:24,802 --> 00:01:25,969
Thought they were going to fall off.

29
00:01:26,053 --> 00:01:27,470
Your lips fell off?

30
00:01:27,555 --> 00:01:29,180
Yeah, almost.

31
00:01:29,265 --> 00:01:30,223
Why were you so nervous?

32
00:01:30,307 --> 00:01:31,724
You knew I was gonna say yes.

33
00:01:31,809 --> 00:01:32,559
I mean as long as you didn't ask me

34
00:01:32,643 --> 00:01:33,977
in front of a billion people.

35
00:01:34,061 --> 00:01:36,020
Oh no, you made that
perfectly clear.

36
00:01:36,105 --> 00:01:37,230
That goes for you boys too,

37
00:01:37,314 --> 00:01:39,357
never ask a girl to marry
you in public.

38
00:01:39,441 --> 00:01:40,733
It's very uncouth.

39
00:01:40,818 --> 00:01:42,735
How can you ever be
sure that you wanna spend

40
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:44,487
the rest of your life with someone?

41
00:01:44,572 --> 00:01:47,115
Heavenly father tells you it, dummy.

42
00:01:47,199 --> 00:01:48,366
Tyler said the D word.

43
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:50,076
Tyler, not the D word, buddy.

44
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:51,703
Well I'm right, aren't I?

45
00:01:51,787 --> 00:01:53,121
Yes and no.

46
00:01:54,415 --> 00:01:56,082
We prayed about it and it
felt like the right thing

47
00:01:56,166 --> 00:01:58,918
to do, but the rest was
on us, our commitment.

48
00:01:59,003 --> 00:02:00,503
Part of what makes it makes it right

49
00:02:00,588 --> 00:02:02,880
between two people is
because they choose for it

50
00:02:02,965 --> 00:02:06,175
to be right and then they commit
themselves to that choice.

51
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:09,470
We prepare for
marriage our whole lives.

52
00:02:09,555 --> 00:02:11,097
So it's a lot of pressure.

53
00:02:11,181 --> 00:02:12,307
Best decision of my life.

54
00:02:12,391 --> 00:02:13,808
Well it better be.

55
00:02:15,728 --> 00:02:17,812
- Ewe.
- Oh come on,

56
00:02:17,896 --> 00:02:18,646
it's not that bad.

57
00:02:18,731 --> 00:02:19,814
Oh, who wants treats?

58
00:02:19,898 --> 00:02:20,898
- Me, me, yes.
- Oh me.

59
00:02:20,983 --> 00:02:22,650
Hey, hey, line up.

60
00:02:22,735 --> 00:02:23,484
Come on, we're not animals.

61
00:02:23,569 --> 00:02:24,444
Seeing the example

62
00:02:24,528 --> 00:02:26,821
of how much my parents
loved each other

63
00:02:26,905 --> 00:02:29,657
always made me excited for
the day I would meet the man

64
00:02:29,742 --> 00:02:34,203
that would propose to me, the
man I would be with forever.

65
00:02:36,582 --> 00:02:39,083
One Sunday when I about 13,

66
00:02:39,168 --> 00:02:41,210
we did this activity in Young Women's

67
00:02:41,295 --> 00:02:42,754
that really made me think.

68
00:02:42,838 --> 00:02:43,796
Maybe you've heard of this.

69
00:02:43,881 --> 00:02:45,590
All right girls, settled down.

70
00:02:45,674 --> 00:02:47,091
Sister Valentine is going

71
00:02:47,176 --> 00:02:50,053
to give each of you a piece
of paper and an envelope

72
00:02:50,137 --> 00:02:52,347
because you're each going
to be writing a letter.

73
00:02:52,431 --> 00:02:54,098
Can we just text it instead?

74
00:02:54,183 --> 00:02:55,892
No, Hannah, you have to
actually write it down.

75
00:02:55,976 --> 00:02:58,895
My dad says texting's a
terrestrial form of communication.

76
00:02:58,979 --> 00:03:00,063
No one cares, Mykelle.

77
00:03:00,147 --> 00:03:02,231
- Guys.
- Okay, can we all focus?

78
00:03:02,316 --> 00:03:03,983
This is no ordinary letter

79
00:03:04,068 --> 00:03:07,028
because it will be addressed to you.

80
00:03:07,112 --> 00:03:09,072
Not that you of today,

81
00:03:09,156 --> 00:03:12,158
but the you in the future
on the day of your wedding.

82
00:03:12,242 --> 00:03:14,744
I've actually been
thinking a lot about this.

83
00:03:14,828 --> 00:03:16,746
- Of course you have.
- I know this is subject

84
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:19,374
to change, but I currently
have zero interest

85
00:03:19,458 --> 00:03:20,833
in the inferior gender.

86
00:03:20,918 --> 00:03:22,627
So what am I supposed to write about?

87
00:03:22,711 --> 00:03:25,505
Well maybe you could
write down the attributes

88
00:03:25,589 --> 00:03:27,548
that you want in your future spouse.

89
00:03:27,633 --> 00:03:29,926
How do you spell anesthesiologist?

90
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:30,760
Good one, Paige.

91
00:03:30,844 --> 00:03:33,012
Can we put that he has
to be super hot,

92
00:03:33,097 --> 00:03:34,681
like brother Carrington?

93
00:03:36,183 --> 00:03:37,684
- Charlotte.
- You can put

94
00:03:37,768 --> 00:03:38,726
whatever you want.

95
00:03:38,811 --> 00:03:41,688
These letters are just for you,
you're not turning them in.

96
00:03:41,772 --> 00:03:44,190
But we do want you to focus

97
00:03:44,274 --> 00:03:48,194
on inner attributes and not
just what's on the outside.

98
00:03:48,278 --> 00:03:51,698
What advice would you
give to your future self?

99
00:03:51,782 --> 00:03:55,493
What qualities are important
to you in a healthy marriage?

100
00:03:55,577 --> 00:03:57,954
Really put some thought into it.

101
00:03:58,038 --> 00:04:00,540
Choosing who you wanna
marry is also choosing

102
00:04:00,624 --> 00:04:01,916
who you wanna be.

103
00:04:03,043 --> 00:04:06,379
Use it as a guide for the
type of person you wanna date.

104
00:04:06,463 --> 00:04:07,296
I want you to hold on

105
00:04:07,381 --> 00:04:10,758
to these letters, keep
them in a safe place.

106
00:04:10,843 --> 00:04:13,970
You may wanna refer to them
over the next few years.

107
00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:24,105
Bree honey, it's
your turn to set the table.

108
00:04:24,189 --> 00:04:25,606
I'll be right down.

109
00:04:25,691 --> 00:04:27,400
As excited as I was to write

110
00:04:27,484 --> 00:04:31,154
that letter, for some reason,
I kind of forgot about it.

111
00:04:31,238 --> 00:04:32,321
I put it in my hope chest,

112
00:04:32,406 --> 00:04:34,157
but never really looked at it again,

113
00:04:35,242 --> 00:04:38,202
that is until my wedding day.

114
00:05:15,532 --> 00:05:18,785
Anyone who knows me knows
it was my absolute dream

115
00:05:18,869 --> 00:05:22,288
to go to BYU, but not to
the Provo campus.

116
00:05:22,372 --> 00:05:24,791
And no, I don't mean BYU, Idaho,
either.

117
00:05:24,875 --> 00:05:27,210
You can't even wear sandals there.

118
00:05:27,294 --> 00:05:30,171
I meant BYU, Hawaii.

119
00:05:30,255 --> 00:05:32,131
I feel like if Brigham
Young would have seen

120
00:05:32,216 --> 00:05:34,217
how beautiful Oahu is,

121
00:05:34,301 --> 00:05:37,804
he would have said,
actually, this is the place.

122
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,431
Oh my gosh, look, a whale.

123
00:05:40,516 --> 00:05:44,185
I lived in the best house
with the best roommates

124
00:05:44,269 --> 00:05:46,562
and my new college bestie, Leilani,

125
00:05:46,647 --> 00:05:48,147
that's her with the camera.

126
00:05:48,232 --> 00:05:50,983
And what better place to
pursue my lifelong dream

127
00:05:51,068 --> 00:05:53,277
of becoming a Marine biologist?

128
00:05:53,362 --> 00:05:56,656
The professors are amazing
and the program is top notch.

129
00:05:57,741 --> 00:05:59,867
I couldn't imagine going
anywhere else.

130
00:06:07,042 --> 00:06:10,461
We studied hard and we
played hard too.

131
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:16,050
And I might have found
myself a boyfriend.

132
00:06:17,219 --> 00:06:19,136
Not him, gross.

133
00:06:20,556 --> 00:06:22,431
Nope, still not him.

134
00:06:25,394 --> 00:06:30,231
Him, Thys Abner Chesterfield.

135
00:06:30,315 --> 00:06:31,440
I know, right?

136
00:06:31,525 --> 00:06:35,444
Only the most sought
after man at BYU, Hawaii.

137
00:06:35,529 --> 00:06:39,240
He just got back from his
mission in Thailand last fall.

138
00:06:39,324 --> 00:06:40,533
He's super smart,

139
00:06:40,617 --> 00:06:45,538
athletic and amazing at
games, like freakishly.

140
00:06:45,622 --> 00:06:47,415
I mean he could totally
be on college jeopardy

141
00:06:47,499 --> 00:06:50,001
if he wanted, he's just
started taking the test.

142
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:54,547
We got to know each other
in a real organic way

143
00:06:54,631 --> 00:06:56,757
because he was waiting for
his high school girlfriend

144
00:06:56,842 --> 00:06:58,467
to get back from her mission

145
00:06:58,552 --> 00:07:01,220
and I was about to leave
on my mission.

146
00:07:02,681 --> 00:07:06,434
We both knew we had to break
up at the end of the semester,

147
00:07:06,518 --> 00:07:09,896
but he was a really good guy
and a really good kisser.

148
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:12,857
So it wasn't going to be easy.

149
00:07:14,735 --> 00:07:15,860
Gosh, I love Hawaii.

150
00:07:17,529 --> 00:07:21,282
And then on Saturday, Thys took
me to hike the Ka'au Crater.

151
00:07:21,366 --> 00:07:24,952
Mom, there are so many waterfalls
and the crater is huge,

152
00:07:25,037 --> 00:07:26,037
you and dad would have loved it.

153
00:07:26,121 --> 00:07:27,455
Seems like you're spending a lot

154
00:07:27,539 --> 00:07:28,915
of time with this Thys fellow.

155
00:07:28,999 --> 00:07:31,334
That's why it's gonna be
so hard to break up with him.

156
00:07:31,418 --> 00:07:33,794
Oh don't think about it
as breaking up.

157
00:07:33,879 --> 00:07:37,048
Think about it as supporting
each other's dreams.

158
00:07:37,132 --> 00:07:39,091
Yeah, I like that.

159
00:07:39,176 --> 00:07:40,885
And it's true, I mean
you’ll always hold

160
00:07:40,969 --> 00:07:43,179
a really special place
in your heart for him.

161
00:07:44,389 --> 00:07:46,766
But it's okay because
now that my papers are in,

162
00:07:46,850 --> 00:07:48,351
I can look forward to
getting my mission call.

163
00:07:48,435 --> 00:07:49,727
Wait, what did you say?

164
00:07:49,811 --> 00:07:51,228
I submitted my papers this morning.

165
00:07:51,313 --> 00:07:52,104
Oh!

166
00:07:53,857 --> 00:07:55,691
I thought you were gonna
wait till Christmas break.

167
00:07:55,776 --> 00:07:58,736
I know, but then I got
the most inspiring email

168
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:01,572
from Paige and I just
figured, you know, why wait?

169
00:08:01,657 --> 00:08:03,532
Like the sooner I send them in,

170
00:08:03,617 --> 00:08:05,576
the sooner I can get out
there and serve.

171
00:08:05,661 --> 00:08:09,121
Oh honey, I am so excited for you.

172
00:08:09,206 --> 00:08:10,122
Where do you think you're gonna go?

173
00:08:10,207 --> 00:08:13,292
I don't know, but I really
hope I get to learn a language.

174
00:08:13,377 --> 00:08:15,252
Oh, don't say that,
you don't wanna jinx it.

175
00:08:15,337 --> 00:08:16,087
You know what happened to your father.

176
00:08:16,171 --> 00:08:18,464
I mean, not that there's
anything wrong with Montana.

177
00:08:18,548 --> 00:08:21,092
Absolutely, your father
was meant for Missoula.

178
00:08:21,176 --> 00:08:23,177
But wouldn't Switzerland be great?

179
00:08:23,261 --> 00:08:25,054
My gosh, please let it
be anywhere in Europe.

180
00:08:25,138 --> 00:08:26,931
Anywhere in Western Europe,

181
00:08:27,015 --> 00:08:29,058
we don’t want a Saratov situation.

182
00:08:29,142 --> 00:08:30,017
You know what?

183
00:08:30,102 --> 00:08:30,893
Bring it on.

184
00:08:30,978 --> 00:08:32,812
I'm ready for anything

185
00:08:32,896 --> 00:08:35,648
because I know that
wherever the Lord takes you

186
00:08:35,732 --> 00:08:37,692
is where he wants you to be.

187
00:08:37,776 --> 00:08:40,611
Oh, I am so writing this down.

188
00:08:41,571 --> 00:08:44,949
Oh, you are just gonna
be the best missionary,

189
00:08:45,033 --> 00:08:46,826
Bree, the best.

190
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:49,745
I am so jealous that they
lowered the age after my time.

191
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:51,580
I so would have served when I was 19.

192
00:08:51,665 --> 00:08:53,499
Well, you became the best mom ever.

193
00:08:53,583 --> 00:08:55,418
So I'd say you served that mission

194
00:08:55,502 --> 00:08:56,669
- pretty well.
- Still serving,

195
00:08:56,753 --> 00:08:57,586
thank you very much.

196
00:08:57,671 --> 00:08:59,547
Tyler, get off the internet.

197
00:08:59,631 --> 00:09:02,216
O-F-F you've already
used your screen time.

198
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:04,385
Speaking of screen time,
I had better scoot.

199
00:09:04,469 --> 00:09:06,012
Nedra's having us over
for a potluck dinner

200
00:09:06,096 --> 00:09:07,054
to meet her new boyfriend.

201
00:09:07,139 --> 00:09:09,265
What, sister Rockwell.

202
00:09:09,349 --> 00:09:10,516
I need all the details.

203
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:13,644
Well his name is Bud
and that's all I know,

204
00:09:13,729 --> 00:09:15,855
but I'll give you the full
report tomorrow morning.

205
00:09:15,939 --> 00:09:17,064
I can't wait.

206
00:09:17,149 --> 00:09:19,775
Margaret, you know those
cookies are for the Folkners.

207
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:22,111
I am so proud of you, I love you.

208
00:09:22,195 --> 00:09:23,821
I love you so much.

209
00:09:23,905 --> 00:09:24,655
I miss you.

210
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:28,242
You guys, Bree
turned in her papers!

211
00:09:32,998 --> 00:09:34,957
Hey, you be a good girl, yeah?

212
00:09:35,042 --> 00:09:37,585
You be a good girl when
I'm gone, yeah, yeah?

213
00:09:39,671 --> 00:09:40,713
I'm gonna miss you.

214
00:09:42,299 --> 00:09:43,090
You know, you wouldn't have

215
00:09:43,175 --> 00:09:45,259
to miss her if you took the
internship I offered you.

216
00:09:45,343 --> 00:09:47,762
I know, oh, I wish I could.

217
00:09:47,846 --> 00:09:49,430
I'm just giving you a hard time.

218
00:09:49,514 --> 00:09:50,973
We're just gonna really
miss you around here.

219
00:09:51,058 --> 00:09:53,684
Yeah me too a lot, but
you know what?

220
00:09:53,769 --> 00:09:54,810
I'll be back before you know it.

221
00:09:54,895 --> 00:09:56,395
Great 'cause that's an offer.

222
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,396
- Really?
- Yeah,

223
00:09:57,481 --> 00:09:58,564
you have a talent for this.

224
00:09:58,648 --> 00:10:00,566
I mean I really hope
that you stick with it.

225
00:10:00,650 --> 00:10:02,193
Yeah, I plan on it.

226
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,945
Bye Patenka, I'll miss you.

227
00:10:19,044 --> 00:10:20,503
So most people know that crabs

228
00:10:20,587 --> 00:10:21,712
and lobsters are related, right?

229
00:10:21,797 --> 00:10:23,839
They're both part of the
arthropod family.

230
00:10:23,924 --> 00:10:26,884
Do you know what else is
part of that same family?

231
00:10:26,968 --> 00:10:27,760
Spiders.

232
00:10:28,637 --> 00:10:31,639
That's so crazy, that's so cool.

233
00:10:31,723 --> 00:10:33,599
It is cool Thys, it's very cool.

234
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:38,896
I think I know what's bothering you.

235
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:41,107
- You do?
- Thys, I get it.

236
00:10:41,191 --> 00:10:43,109
You're upset about saying goodbye.

237
00:10:43,193 --> 00:10:46,153
Look, so am I, but let's
not think about it that way.

238
00:10:46,238 --> 00:10:50,324
Just focus on all the fun
times we've had this semester,

239
00:10:50,408 --> 00:10:52,034
all the memories we've made.

240
00:10:52,119 --> 00:10:55,287
I mean, look, we're not breaking up,

241
00:10:55,372 --> 00:10:58,415
we're just headed in different paths.

242
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:00,835
- So let's not be sad.
- Oh, I'm not sad.

243
00:11:02,045 --> 00:11:05,548
I promise I'm not sad, I'm
actually like super happy.

244
00:11:06,383 --> 00:11:09,051
Okay, well you don't
want to say it like that.

245
00:11:10,387 --> 00:11:11,303
Gotta go, we gotta go,

246
00:11:11,388 --> 00:11:12,721
- let's go, get up.
- Wait, what?

247
00:11:15,142 --> 00:11:17,643
Okay, grab
your crab leg, let's go.

248
00:11:37,164 --> 00:11:40,624
How's everybody doing
out there tonight?

249
00:11:41,710 --> 00:11:44,587
Ladies and gentlemen,
we have a special treat

250
00:11:44,671 --> 00:11:49,258
for you tonight but first, I'm
gonna need a lady volunteer.

251
00:11:50,218 --> 00:11:51,177
Let me look around.

252
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:53,762
You, yes.

253
00:11:59,186 --> 00:12:01,061
- What's your name?
- Bree Carrington.

254
00:12:01,146 --> 00:12:02,855
- Is that a real name?
- Yes.

255
00:12:02,939 --> 00:12:03,689
It sounds made up.

256
00:12:03,773 --> 00:12:07,151
All right come on everybody,
give it up for Bree Carrington.

257
00:12:08,737 --> 00:12:11,906
How many of you have seen
a dance battle?

258
00:12:13,408 --> 00:12:16,327
Because tonight, Bree is going

259
00:12:16,411 --> 00:12:20,122
to battle my man, Fanaue se Ein.

260
00:12:21,917 --> 00:12:23,417
It's a fire night dance battle.

261
00:12:26,546 --> 00:12:27,421
- What do I do?
- I don't know.

262
00:12:28,298 --> 00:12:30,049
You're the one that volunteered.

263
00:12:31,468 --> 00:12:33,719
Just give it your best, all right?

264
00:12:36,932 --> 00:12:39,058
Yeah, that's a good start.

265
00:12:43,104 --> 00:12:44,772
Come on everybody, give it up.

266
00:12:48,693 --> 00:12:51,445
Let's check out the competition.

267
00:13:07,712 --> 00:13:10,798
It's okay, Bree, we'll keep you safe.

268
00:13:17,931 --> 00:13:20,099
It's safe to come out now.

269
00:13:27,357 --> 00:13:31,527
Bree Christine Carrington,
will you marry me?

270
00:13:41,413 --> 00:13:42,246
Do it!

271
00:13:48,461 --> 00:13:49,837
Of course I will.

272
00:13:54,259 --> 00:13:56,302
- I love you so much.
- I love you too.

273
00:13:57,178 --> 00:14:01,473
Give it up for the newly
engaged couple, Bree and Thys.

274
00:14:10,817 --> 00:14:13,152
Almost had a heart attack, Thys.

275
00:14:13,236 --> 00:14:15,446
I mean, what happened to the plan?

276
00:14:15,530 --> 00:14:17,823
My mission, your girlfriend.

277
00:14:17,907 --> 00:14:18,741
She's not my girlfriend.

278
00:14:18,825 --> 00:14:20,951
Okay but she was for like 10 years

279
00:14:21,036 --> 00:14:21,952
and you're always talking

280
00:14:22,037 --> 00:14:24,204
about how you're gonna
wait until she gets back

281
00:14:24,289 --> 00:14:26,540
and you know, give the
relationship a real shot

282
00:14:26,624 --> 00:14:28,834
because you owe each other that.

283
00:14:28,918 --> 00:14:30,210
Oh, is that how I sound?

284
00:14:30,295 --> 00:14:32,296
- Is that my voice?
- Just answer the question.

285
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:34,340
Okay, okay, fair.

286
00:14:34,424 --> 00:14:37,593
What happened?

287
00:14:37,677 --> 00:14:39,386
You happened, all right?

288
00:14:39,471 --> 00:14:40,387
Yeah, I had a plan.

289
00:14:40,472 --> 00:14:42,306
I thought I had everything figured out

290
00:14:42,390 --> 00:14:44,058
but then you change all that.

291
00:14:44,142 --> 00:14:46,310
Bree, you change everything.

292
00:14:50,815 --> 00:14:53,817
No, what about my mission?

293
00:14:55,153 --> 00:14:55,986
I know.

294
00:14:57,822 --> 00:15:01,075
I'm sorry, I know, I just,
I didn't wanna lose you.

295
00:15:02,535 --> 00:15:03,660
Did you talk to my dad?

296
00:15:03,745 --> 00:15:04,953
Is that still a thing?

297
00:15:05,038 --> 00:15:06,080
Yes, it is a thing.

298
00:15:06,164 --> 00:15:08,040
Even with like feminism
and everything?

299
00:15:08,124 --> 00:15:09,458
- Thys.
- No, sorry, yeah.

300
00:15:09,542 --> 00:15:13,379
Look I'm sorry it came as
a shock to you, genuinely.

301
00:15:13,463 --> 00:15:15,005
It came as a shock to me too, right?

302
00:15:15,090 --> 00:15:15,839
'Cause yeah, we talked

303
00:15:15,924 --> 00:15:17,257
about it, we talked about
it like a million times,

304
00:15:17,342 --> 00:15:20,719
but every time I think
about losing you, I go nuts.

305
00:15:20,804 --> 00:15:23,138
Like even right now, the
idea of us breaking up,

306
00:15:23,223 --> 00:15:27,142
it hurts in a way that
I can't really handle.

307
00:15:31,272 --> 00:15:33,524
Did you pray about it?

308
00:15:33,608 --> 00:15:34,900
Everyday since I met you.

309
00:15:37,654 --> 00:15:39,154
Like it feels right, right?

310
00:15:41,032 --> 00:15:44,076
- I don’t know, maybe.
- Maybe?

311
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:46,620
She says maybe 'cause
like five seconds ago,

312
00:15:46,704 --> 00:15:48,580
you were on stage going, oh my gosh,

313
00:15:48,665 --> 00:15:50,249
yes Thys, of course I will.

314
00:15:50,333 --> 00:15:52,334
Oh is that what I sound like?

315
00:15:52,419 --> 00:15:54,169
Yes, yes, the cadence
is a little off,

316
00:15:54,254 --> 00:15:57,714
but the tone is like dead on.

317
00:15:59,884 --> 00:16:02,678
Okay, so what's your answer?

318
00:16:02,762 --> 00:16:06,014
Because I can't really handle a maybe.

319
00:16:06,099 --> 00:16:07,891
I think I just need a second

320
00:16:07,976 --> 00:16:11,937
to process it and to pray about
it and talk to my parents.

321
00:16:12,021 --> 00:16:15,691
But are we talking
like, days, months, years?

322
00:16:15,775 --> 00:16:17,067
Like what are we thinking?

323
00:16:17,152 --> 00:16:19,445
I don’t know exactly.

324
00:16:19,529 --> 00:16:23,407
I mean, Thys, do you realize
that tonight is the first time

325
00:16:23,491 --> 00:16:26,326
that you've ever even
said, I love you, to me?

326
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:31,248
True, but Bree, I mean it.

327
00:16:33,293 --> 00:16:35,461
And you said it back, so
what does that tell you?

328
00:16:38,715 --> 00:16:39,548
Did you mean it?

329
00:16:45,555 --> 00:16:48,849
Yes, I love you.

330
00:16:48,933 --> 00:16:50,559
I love you too.

331
00:16:51,644 --> 00:16:55,022
I've wanted to say that for so long.

332
00:16:55,106 --> 00:16:57,149
I'm sorry, I'm sorry if I scared you.

333
00:16:57,984 --> 00:16:59,485
No, I messed up.

334
00:16:59,569 --> 00:17:00,402
I should've talked to you,

335
00:17:00,487 --> 00:17:02,196
of course I should've talked to you.

336
00:17:03,114 --> 00:17:04,239
Take as long as you need

337
00:17:07,076 --> 00:17:11,330
and maybe you don't say
anything about this to people.

338
00:17:11,414 --> 00:17:13,332
I mean, just until you figure it out.

339
00:17:14,626 --> 00:17:15,584
Of course.

340
00:17:15,668 --> 00:17:18,086
Give it up for
the newly engaged couple,

341
00:17:18,171 --> 00:17:20,714
- Bree and Thys.
- Look at my cinematography.

342
00:17:20,798 --> 00:17:22,174
I captured you perfectly.

343
00:17:22,258 --> 00:17:23,717
I was so scared.

344
00:17:23,801 --> 00:17:25,260
Here it is in slow motion.

345
00:17:26,346 --> 00:17:27,471
You look possessed.

346
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:31,350
I still can't believe he did it.

347
00:17:31,434 --> 00:17:34,353
I can, that hull is crazy.

348
00:17:35,355 --> 00:17:36,313
What'd your mom say?

349
00:17:36,397 --> 00:17:37,856
I haven't called her yet.

350
00:17:37,941 --> 00:17:39,650
What, it's like 03:00 a.m. for her.

351
00:17:39,734 --> 00:17:41,151
I'll call her in the morning.

352
00:17:42,237 --> 00:17:43,654
Wanna to watch "Black Mirror"?

353
00:17:43,738 --> 00:17:45,364
I'm exhausted, I think
I'm just gonna go

354
00:17:45,448 --> 00:17:48,700
to bed and read and do
a little praying, okay?

355
00:17:48,785 --> 00:17:51,745
Fine, I'll just check my Finsta.

356
00:17:51,829 --> 00:17:53,997
I told you to
delete that account.

357
00:17:54,082 --> 00:17:55,958

Okay, okay, would you
rather fight one duck,

363
00:19:20,084 --> 00:19:22,961
but it's like the size of a
horse, like a real big duck,

364
00:19:23,046 --> 00:19:25,964
or would you rather fight 100 horses

365
00:19:26,049 --> 00:19:27,758
but they're the size of
like the little ducks?

366
00:19:27,842 --> 00:19:29,676
Oh M gosh.

367
00:19:32,096 --> 00:19:35,307
He's cute, I mean no
Neville Longbottom, but.

368
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:38,935
More like centered Diggory, R.I.P.

369
00:19:40,188 --> 00:19:41,772
He's got six brothers.

370
00:19:41,856 --> 00:19:44,232
Come on, choose.

371
00:19:44,317 --> 00:19:45,525
Can I use a Katana?

372
00:19:45,610 --> 00:19:48,153
No, no weapons, bare hands.

373
00:19:52,575 --> 00:19:54,326
Will you marry me?

374
00:19:54,410 --> 00:19:55,202
Yikes.

375
00:20:00,208 --> 00:20:01,792
Will you marry me?

376
00:20:01,876 --> 00:20:04,044

382
00:20:25,233 --> 00:20:27,567
Now with these final few breaths,

383
00:20:27,652 --> 00:20:31,321
I want you to let go of any
negativity you may have had.

384
00:20:31,406 --> 00:20:34,074
Any miscommunication with a loved one,

385
00:20:34,158 --> 00:20:36,284
let it go and breathe.

386
00:20:37,161 --> 00:20:39,287
Don’t let what you can't control you.

387
00:20:42,583 --> 00:20:44,918
And have a good day, namaste.

388
00:20:45,753 --> 00:20:48,130
Namaste.

389
00:20:48,214 --> 00:20:49,631
All right my little early birds,

390
00:20:49,716 --> 00:20:51,341
you go to catch that worm.

391
00:20:51,426 --> 00:20:53,093
Oh and remember that the
Hawkins reception

392
00:20:53,177 --> 00:20:55,178
is here tonight in the cultural hall.

393
00:20:55,263 --> 00:20:56,388
So let's leave it a little bit better

394
00:20:56,472 --> 00:20:57,639
than we found it, okay?

395
00:20:58,558 --> 00:21:01,226
Nedra, your practices is
really improving.

396
00:21:01,310 --> 00:21:03,145
Well it's no CrossFit,

397
00:21:03,229 --> 00:21:05,647
but my boo says that
it's calming my temper,

398
00:21:05,732 --> 00:21:07,649
- so I'll stick with it.
- Okay.

399
00:21:07,734 --> 00:21:08,734
I really like what you said

400
00:21:08,818 --> 00:21:10,944
about letting go of
what you can't control.

401
00:21:11,028 --> 00:21:12,779
Oh good 'cause I stole
it from a fortune cookie.

402
00:21:12,864 --> 00:21:15,782
I am running out of
Eastern wisdom, like fast.

403
00:21:15,867 --> 00:21:17,534
Should I learn Sanskrit?

404
00:21:18,661 --> 00:21:19,661
No.

405
00:21:21,831 --> 00:21:24,499
There go the lsraelites
back to their idol worship.

406
00:21:24,584 --> 00:21:26,501
I wonder about the
buzz is all about.

407
00:21:30,131 --> 00:21:31,798
- Bree Carrington.
- Is that a real name?

408
00:21:31,883 --> 00:21:34,217
- Yes.
- It sounds made up.

409
00:21:34,302 --> 00:21:37,763
Bree Christine
Carrington, will you marry me?

410
00:21:37,847 --> 00:21:40,891
Namaste, namaste, namaste, namaste.

411
00:21:44,061 --> 00:21:49,065
Namaste!

412
00:21:49,650 --> 00:21:50,567
Get up, we got 20 minutes

413
00:21:50,651 --> 00:21:52,527
to get to the airport if we're
gonna catch the non-stop.

414
00:21:52,612 --> 00:21:53,820
What's happening?

415
00:21:53,905 --> 00:21:54,821
Honey, you know what?

416
00:21:54,906 --> 00:21:55,655
I know what's not happening,

417
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:57,866
but I know what’s not happening,
this is not happening.

418
00:21:57,950 --> 00:22:01,077
Okay, this is one of
those meme, gify things.

419
00:22:01,162 --> 00:22:02,496
It's not a gif and it's not a joke.

420
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:03,789
Get your butt out of bed, let's go.

421
00:22:03,873 --> 00:22:05,290
Okay, but you know what?

422
00:22:05,374 --> 00:22:07,375
Before we go completely insane

423
00:22:08,252 --> 00:22:10,670
and fly to Hawaii, hey,
let's give her a call.

424
00:22:10,755 --> 00:22:12,964
Oh I tried calling her 37 times.

425
00:22:13,049 --> 00:22:14,007
She's not answering her phone,

426
00:22:14,091 --> 00:22:15,842
so I need to go and talk to
my daughter face-to-face.

427
00:22:15,927 --> 00:22:17,636
Okay honey, we're not
really in the best

428
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:19,721
financial situation to
take the last minute trip.

429
00:22:19,806 --> 00:22:20,555
I've got it all covered.

430
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,140
Nedra is gifting us her sky miles

431
00:22:22,225 --> 00:22:23,975
and Holly is taking care of the kids.

432
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:25,685
Lodging and there's some food...

433
00:22:25,770 --> 00:22:26,937
I don't care if we need
to build a lean

434
00:22:27,021 --> 00:22:28,563
to on the beach and eat coconuts

435
00:22:28,648 --> 00:22:30,315
for every meal, I need
to talk to my daughter.

436
00:22:30,399 --> 00:22:32,984
We need to talk some sense into her.

437
00:22:33,069 --> 00:22:33,819
I'm gonna pack.

438
00:22:33,903 --> 00:22:34,778
I got you covered.

439
00:22:36,239 --> 00:22:38,865
72 Hour kits, those are
for emergencies.

440
00:22:38,950 --> 00:22:40,659
What do you call this?

441
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:44,204
Leilani wake up.

442
00:22:44,288 --> 00:22:45,372
Someone posted my engagement video

443
00:22:45,456 --> 00:22:47,582
and now everyone is reposting.

444
00:22:47,667 --> 00:22:49,292
So messed up, who would do that?

445
00:22:49,377 --> 00:22:50,293
You did it.

446
00:22:50,378 --> 00:22:51,586
You're the only one who
had this video.

447
00:22:51,671 --> 00:22:52,587
Who did you send it to?

448
00:22:52,672 --> 00:22:54,047
I only sent it to Lily.

449
00:22:54,131 --> 00:22:55,048
Lily Porter?

450
00:22:55,132 --> 00:22:56,716
You might as well send it to Buzzfeed.

451
00:22:56,801 --> 00:22:58,093
Leilani what were you thinking?

452
00:22:58,177 --> 00:22:59,302
She promised
not to post it.

453
00:22:59,387 --> 00:23:01,096
Well she lied.

454
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:02,222
That's so messed up.

455
00:23:03,099 --> 00:23:05,600
Over 500 likes and no photo credits?

456
00:23:05,685 --> 00:23:08,687
You don't understand,
my mom saw this.

457
00:23:10,273 --> 00:23:14,985
Wait, my video is
how your mom found out?

458
00:23:15,069 --> 00:23:16,403
I mean, she's literally
going to kill me.

459
00:23:16,487 --> 00:23:17,279
What do I do?

460
00:23:18,322 --> 00:23:20,115
I know a cave on the big island.

461
00:23:20,199 --> 00:23:21,074
It's not much we can hide

462
00:23:21,158 --> 00:23:22,450
in there until this all blows over.

463
00:23:22,535 --> 00:23:23,785
I'm not hiding in a cave.

464
00:23:23,870 --> 00:23:25,704
I'm just brainstorming.

465
00:23:25,788 --> 00:23:27,706
- I just have to call her.
- What are you gonna say?

466
00:23:27,790 --> 00:23:30,917
I just have to call her
and tell her the truth.

467
00:23:31,002 --> 00:23:34,379
Maybe if you saw a picture
of the cave, it's not so bad.

468
00:23:38,634 --> 00:23:39,801
Do you hear that?

469
00:23:39,886 --> 00:23:43,597
Crazy, it sounds like it's
coming from outside the door.

470
00:23:51,522 --> 00:23:52,981
Aloha, Bree.

471
00:23:53,065 --> 00:23:54,858
Is there something you wanna tell us?

472
00:23:56,319 --> 00:23:58,445
I don’t understand,
are you engaged or not?

473
00:23:58,529 --> 00:24:02,324
Well at first I said yes, but
then I needed more time to...

474
00:24:02,408 --> 00:24:03,158
More time, perfect.

475
00:24:03,242 --> 00:24:05,243
How about a quick 18 months?

476
00:24:05,328 --> 00:24:07,120
Yeah, sounds perfect,
let's get you packed up

477
00:24:07,204 --> 00:24:08,538
so that we can catch the
red eye tonight.

478
00:24:08,623 --> 00:24:10,790
No, I'm not leaving here
until I figure this out.

479
00:24:10,875 --> 00:24:11,625
What's to figure out?

480
00:24:11,709 --> 00:24:12,584
The semester's over, you’re going

481
00:24:12,668 --> 00:24:13,793
on a mission, you're not contributing

482
00:24:13,878 --> 00:24:15,879
to the national teenage
bride statistic.

483
00:24:15,963 --> 00:24:18,006
You were a teenager when
we got married.

484
00:24:18,090 --> 00:24:20,216
I was six days shy of 20

485
00:24:20,301 --> 00:24:22,552
and that was your fault
for asking too soon.

486
00:24:22,637 --> 00:24:23,803
And I still regret it by the way.

487
00:24:23,888 --> 00:24:24,888
You regret marrying dad?

488
00:24:24,972 --> 00:24:26,181
What, are you serious?

489
00:24:26,265 --> 00:24:27,098
No, of course not.

490
00:24:27,183 --> 00:24:28,767
I would have always
married your father.

491
00:24:28,851 --> 00:24:31,686
But in a perfect world, I would
have served a mission first

492
00:24:31,771 --> 00:24:34,689
and had more life experiences
while I was still single.

493
00:24:34,774 --> 00:24:36,191
Okay, I think what your
mother's trying

494
00:24:36,275 --> 00:24:37,817
to say is that her choice

495
00:24:37,902 --> 00:24:41,029
to get married wasn't
necessarily her plan,

496
00:24:41,113 --> 00:24:42,572
but it was a choice that she made

497
00:24:42,657 --> 00:24:45,825
after careful consideration
and a spiritual confirmation.

498
00:24:45,910 --> 00:24:46,868
And not a split second decision

499
00:24:46,953 --> 00:24:48,787
after gorging myself on crab legs.

500
00:24:49,705 --> 00:24:51,289
I'm sorry, that was insensitive.

501
00:24:53,834 --> 00:24:55,961
I'm just trying to understand.

502
00:24:56,045 --> 00:24:57,462
It doesn’t seem like
that's what you're doing.

503
00:24:57,546 --> 00:25:01,675
Sweetie, do you
remember what you told me?

504
00:25:01,759 --> 00:25:02,509
I tell you everything.

505
00:25:02,593 --> 00:25:03,760
You have to be more specific.

506
00:25:03,844 --> 00:25:05,178
About your mission.

507
00:25:05,262 --> 00:25:06,972
- No.
- Well I do

508
00:25:07,056 --> 00:25:08,974
and I stitched it for
you on the plane.

509
00:25:09,934 --> 00:25:12,185
Wherever the Lord takes
you is where he wants you

510
00:25:12,269 --> 00:25:14,354
- to be, your words.
- Okay,

511
00:25:14,438 --> 00:25:16,189
but he took me to Hawaii.

512
00:25:16,273 --> 00:25:17,941
So what if marrying Thys
is what he wants for me?

513
00:25:18,025 --> 00:25:19,401
How could that be?

514
00:25:19,485 --> 00:25:21,528
He proposed to you in
public for crying out loud.

515
00:25:21,612 --> 00:25:22,362
Well, that's the thing,

516
00:25:22,446 --> 00:25:24,739
at first I did just say yes
because I felt pressured

517
00:25:24,824 --> 00:25:26,241
with all these people watching us,

518
00:25:26,325 --> 00:25:31,287
but then when we talked
about it, just me and him...

519
00:25:31,706 --> 00:25:32,580
He and I.

520
00:25:32,665 --> 00:25:33,665
- Mom.
- Sorry, go on.

521
00:25:33,749 --> 00:25:34,666
When it was just the two

522
00:25:34,750 --> 00:25:37,293
of us, it started to make more sense

523
00:25:37,378 --> 00:25:38,461
and then I prayed about it.

524
00:25:38,546 --> 00:25:40,005
- And?
- Well it wasn't like

525
00:25:40,089 --> 00:25:41,381
an angel came down and told me

526
00:25:41,465 --> 00:25:45,719
what to do, but it felt
good and it felt peaceful.

527
00:25:45,803 --> 00:25:47,554
It just feels right.

528
00:25:47,638 --> 00:25:51,016
Oh my sweet girl, he's beguiled you.

529
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:52,267
- Oh geez.
- No.

530
00:25:52,351 --> 00:25:53,435
Bree, honey, come.

531
00:25:56,897 --> 00:25:57,689
What did I do?

532
00:25:57,773 --> 00:25:59,357
Well, your daughter just
left the room in tears.

533
00:25:59,442 --> 00:26:00,191
What do you think?

534
00:26:00,276 --> 00:26:01,026
Well, she's crying because she's

535
00:26:01,110 --> 00:26:03,153
about to give up her
dreams over a boy.

536
00:26:03,237 --> 00:26:04,029
Her dreams or your dreams?

537
00:26:04,113 --> 00:26:06,156
I'm her mother, our
dreams are the same.

538
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:07,741
She's the one that wanted
to serve a mission.

539
00:26:07,825 --> 00:26:10,368
I mean, sure, I might've
pointed her in that direction,

540
00:26:10,453 --> 00:26:12,871
but she submitted her
papers of her own free will

541
00:26:12,955 --> 00:26:16,082
and choice and now 24 hours
later, she's getting married.

542
00:26:16,167 --> 00:26:18,793
Well, this is a
difficult time of life.

543
00:26:18,878 --> 00:26:20,503
You remember being this age?

544
00:26:20,588 --> 00:26:21,921
We need to be here for her.

545
00:26:28,262 --> 00:26:29,804
Bree, honey, can we come in?

546
00:26:34,185 --> 00:26:36,811
The Chesterfields have invited
us over for dinner tonight.

547
00:26:36,896 --> 00:26:38,104
Oh, we wouldn't wanna impose...

548
00:26:38,189 --> 00:26:40,106
No, that sounds lovely.

549
00:26:40,191 --> 00:26:42,192
I need you to be more than cordial.

550
00:26:42,276 --> 00:26:44,694
They may well end up
being my future in-laws,

551
00:26:44,779 --> 00:26:45,987
so I need you to be respectful.

552
00:26:46,072 --> 00:26:47,280
When am I not respectful?

553
00:26:47,364 --> 00:26:49,449
Mom, I don't wanna fight with you.

554
00:26:49,533 --> 00:26:51,159
This is new for all of us.

555
00:26:51,243 --> 00:26:53,745
I don't expect you to know
exactly how to deal with this,

556
00:26:53,829 --> 00:26:56,247
but I do expect for you
to treat me like an adult.

557
00:26:56,332 --> 00:26:57,123
Is that fair?

558
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:58,875
That's fair.

559
00:27:01,378 --> 00:27:03,755
- Hi, auntie.
- Oh Leilani.

560
00:27:07,176 --> 00:27:08,927
What's this all about?

561
00:27:09,011 --> 00:27:10,386
She was scared of mom.

562
00:27:11,555 --> 00:27:16,559
♪ There is beauty all around ♪

563
00:27:19,230 --> 00:27:21,064
Curt, I can't
believe you wore cargo shorts.

564
00:27:21,148 --> 00:27:22,357
Well I’m sorry I didn't think

565
00:27:22,441 --> 00:27:26,027
about fashion while I was
packing my 72 hour emergency kit.

566
00:27:26,112 --> 00:27:27,195
Always think about fashion.

567
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:29,906
Well next time,
I'll pack a matching onesie.

568
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:33,493
Aloha.

569
00:27:35,663 --> 00:27:37,580
- Oh, thank you.
- This is so nice.

570
00:27:37,665 --> 00:27:39,707
- They're for me?
- You of course.

571
00:27:39,792 --> 00:27:41,251
- That's how you do it.
- Matches your shirt.

572
00:27:41,335 --> 00:27:43,837
- Thank you.
- Oh, these are so beautiful.

573
00:27:43,921 --> 00:27:45,922
Thank you didn't need to
bring anything.

574
00:27:46,006 --> 00:27:47,257
Oh no, it's the least we could do.

575
00:27:47,341 --> 00:27:49,342
This is so generous of you to have us.

576
00:27:49,426 --> 00:27:50,176
Are you kidding?

577
00:27:50,261 --> 00:27:51,553
We've been dying to meet you.

578
00:27:51,637 --> 00:27:52,512
Bree has told us so much

579
00:27:52,596 --> 00:27:54,597
about you, we feel like
we know you already.

580
00:27:54,682 --> 00:27:56,641
Only the good things, don't worry.

581
00:27:56,725 --> 00:27:58,726
And anyone who raised
a daughter this amazing

582
00:27:58,811 --> 00:28:00,019
has gotta be pretty incredible.

583
00:28:00,104 --> 00:28:01,396
Well, thank you very much

584
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:03,314
and we've heard nothing but
great things about you too.

585
00:28:03,399 --> 00:28:04,732
- So the bribes work.
- Yes.

586
00:28:04,817 --> 00:28:07,026
Good job, Breebee.

587
00:28:07,111 --> 00:28:07,861
Where's Thys?

588
00:28:07,945 --> 00:28:10,280
He's out getting a key
ingredient for din-din.

589
00:28:10,364 --> 00:28:12,198
He'll be back soon though.

590
00:28:12,283 --> 00:28:14,534
Hey, let's move this
party onto the patio.

591
00:28:14,618 --> 00:28:15,368
- Please come on in.
- Great, yeah,

592
00:28:15,452 --> 00:28:16,828
let's do that.

593
00:28:16,912 --> 00:28:19,539
Welcome to our
little beach pad.

594
00:28:19,623 --> 00:28:20,957
It's amazing, wow.

595
00:28:21,041 --> 00:28:22,959
I figured with all the fresh coconut

596
00:28:23,043 --> 00:28:24,544
and pineapple on the property,

597
00:28:24,628 --> 00:28:28,965
I was just one Vitamix away
from the most delicious drink

598
00:28:29,049 --> 00:28:31,676
known to mankind.

599
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:33,136
Please help yourself.

600
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:35,054
They're virgin of course.

601
00:28:35,139 --> 00:28:36,723
I can't understand why
anyone would want

602
00:28:36,807 --> 00:28:38,975
to ruin this with rum, am I right?

603
00:28:39,059 --> 00:28:40,768
I agree.

604
00:28:40,853 --> 00:28:42,395
I'm still tinkering with
the recipe a little bit.

605
00:28:42,479 --> 00:28:44,355
So feedback is welcome.

606
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:45,523
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

607
00:28:47,735 --> 00:28:49,027
I'll look at those waves.

608
00:28:49,111 --> 00:28:50,069
Swell's coming in.

609
00:28:50,154 --> 00:28:53,156
Oh, we've got a live one here.

610
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:54,032
Is that true, Curt?

611
00:28:54,116 --> 00:28:55,742
Do you like to hang 10 as they say?

612
00:28:55,826 --> 00:28:58,077
Well, no, yeah, I used to surf.

613
00:28:58,162 --> 00:28:59,621
I mean, being from SoCal,

614
00:28:59,705 --> 00:29:01,998
but I just don't get a chance
to do it very often anymore.

615
00:29:02,082 --> 00:29:04,000
He's being modest, he's very good.

616
00:29:04,084 --> 00:29:05,210
- Well.
- Well then you'll have to

617
00:29:05,294 --> 00:29:06,878
borrow one of our boards
while you're here.

618
00:29:06,962 --> 00:29:10,215
I don’t think we're going
to have time for surfing.

619
00:29:10,299 --> 00:29:11,549
We might.

620
00:29:11,634 --> 00:29:13,218
I still can't
get over this view.

621
00:29:13,302 --> 00:29:15,094
Trust me, you never do.

622
00:29:15,179 --> 00:29:17,513
And the ocean wildlife, incredible.

623
00:29:17,598 --> 00:29:18,514
And you can
see it from here?

624
00:29:18,599 --> 00:29:19,807
Oh mom, all the time.

625
00:29:19,892 --> 00:29:22,810
You see everything, spotted
dolphins, spinner dolphins,

626
00:29:22,895 --> 00:29:25,813
bottle-nose, whales too, humpbacks,
sperm,

627
00:29:25,898 --> 00:29:28,107
- false killer whales.
- False killer whales?

628
00:29:28,192 --> 00:29:30,026
Yeah, they're a little
larger than a dolphin.

629
00:29:30,110 --> 00:29:33,112
They're the only surviving
species of the Pseudorca genus.

630
00:29:33,197 --> 00:29:34,280
They're one of my favorites.

631
00:29:34,365 --> 00:29:35,573
Wow Bree, you really got a knack

632
00:29:35,658 --> 00:29:37,325
for this Marine biology stuff.

633
00:29:37,409 --> 00:29:39,619
She has definitely
taught us so much.

634
00:29:39,703 --> 00:29:41,120
I think I see something.

635
00:29:41,205 --> 00:29:42,580
Oh really?

636
00:29:42,665 --> 00:29:43,790
Is that a dolphin?

637
00:29:44,625 --> 00:29:47,502
That is a rare and peculiar species

638
00:29:47,586 --> 00:29:49,921
of the Chesterfield variety.

639
00:29:50,839 --> 00:29:53,007
It's Thys with our dinner.

640
00:29:56,804 --> 00:29:58,012
Aloha, Carringtons.

641
00:29:58,097 --> 00:29:59,180
- Aloha.
- Aloha.

642
00:29:59,265 --> 00:30:01,808
Mom, dad, this is Thys.

643
00:30:01,892 --> 00:30:02,809
I'm so excited to finally meet you,

644
00:30:02,893 --> 00:30:04,727
but I smell like tuna fish

645
00:30:04,812 --> 00:30:07,355
and I'm holding it gigantic spear gun.

646
00:30:07,439 --> 00:30:09,065
So I'm gonna do this properly

647
00:30:09,149 --> 00:30:10,358
and go inside and shower first.

648
00:30:10,442 --> 00:30:12,735
Actually before you get cleaned up,

649
00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:14,988
why don't you take Curt
out and catch a few sets

650
00:30:15,072 --> 00:30:16,739
- before dinner?
- Oh heck yeah.

651
00:30:16,824 --> 00:30:17,532
- Oh yes.
- Nonsense.

652
00:30:17,616 --> 00:30:18,992
No, we are here to visit.

653
00:30:19,076 --> 00:30:20,535
Curt can surf later.

654
00:30:20,619 --> 00:30:22,203
- Yeah.
- No really, it'd be fine.

655
00:30:22,288 --> 00:30:24,706
Besides it's gonna take me a
while to clean those bad boys

656
00:30:24,790 --> 00:30:25,540
and get everything ready.

657
00:30:25,624 --> 00:30:26,833
- Okay, okay.
- Well Curt can help you

658
00:30:26,917 --> 00:30:27,750
clean the fish.

659
00:30:27,835 --> 00:30:29,961
I can help, dad, you should go.

660
00:30:30,045 --> 00:30:32,380
My own sous chef, I like that.

661
00:30:32,464 --> 00:30:34,465
Mom, You should have Mrs.
Chesterfield

662
00:30:34,550 --> 00:30:37,260
give you a tour of this
place, it's amazing.

663
00:30:37,344 --> 00:30:40,263
Oh yes, that would
give us some girl time.

664
00:30:40,347 --> 00:30:41,097
You don't mind, do you, honey?

665
00:30:41,181 --> 00:30:42,890
- It's wonderful.
- Oh yay.

666
00:30:42,975 --> 00:30:44,267
Come on, let's go.

667
00:30:44,351 --> 00:30:45,435
You know it's funny,

668
00:30:45,519 --> 00:30:48,604
I didn’t think I'd
actually enjoy living

669
00:30:48,689 --> 00:30:50,064
in paradise, but you know what?

670
00:30:50,149 --> 00:30:53,443
It turns out, it's not so bad.

671
00:30:53,527 --> 00:30:56,112
So where should we start,
the east or west wing?

672
00:30:56,196 --> 00:30:57,238
Oh, I...

673
00:30:57,323 --> 00:30:59,615
When in doubt,
go east I always say.

674
00:31:00,451 --> 00:31:04,203
So for openers, all of the
wood here was locally sourced.

675
00:31:04,288 --> 00:31:05,496
Oh, of course.

676
00:31:05,581 --> 00:31:06,539
It was tricky.

677
00:31:06,623 --> 00:31:09,042
I didn't wanna go overboard
with the decor here.

678
00:31:09,126 --> 00:31:11,085
I mean the beauty of these islands,

679
00:31:11,170 --> 00:31:13,129
it just, it speaks for itself.

680
00:31:13,213 --> 00:31:15,298
That's why I opted for simplicity.

681
00:31:15,382 --> 00:31:16,883
Can see that.

682
00:31:16,967 --> 00:31:18,092
You know it's funny, initially,

683
00:31:18,177 --> 00:31:20,219
we never even planned
to have a second house,

684
00:31:20,304 --> 00:31:22,889
but we found we were
spending so much time here

685
00:31:22,973 --> 00:31:24,724
with foundation and all, you know?

686
00:31:24,808 --> 00:31:27,310
It just, I don't know,
didn't make sense not to.

687
00:31:28,729 --> 00:31:33,441
Ah, and there they are,
my Stripling warriors,

688
00:31:33,525 --> 00:31:36,361
all served missions and
all married in the temple.

689
00:31:36,445 --> 00:31:37,987
Well all except Thys of course.

690
00:31:38,072 --> 00:31:40,531
I mean, not yet anyway.

691
00:31:40,616 --> 00:31:42,867
- So handsome.
- Yes, they are definitely

692
00:31:42,951 --> 00:31:44,410
blessed in that department.

693
00:31:44,495 --> 00:31:46,996
Derek here, he struggled
with his weight a little bit

694
00:31:47,081 --> 00:31:50,917
for a while, but still he
married a Romney cousin.

695
00:31:51,001 --> 00:31:52,418
Come on through.

696
00:31:52,503 --> 00:31:55,004
Next stop will be my home clinic.

697
00:31:55,089 --> 00:31:56,381
You'll have to excuse the mess.

698
00:31:56,465 --> 00:31:58,257
I can't tell you
how excited I am about this.

699
00:31:58,342 --> 00:31:59,550
Yeah, feeling good?

700
00:31:59,635 --> 00:32:00,927
Yeah, it’s been a little while.

701
00:32:01,011 --> 00:32:01,803
So no judgment.

702
00:32:01,887 --> 00:32:03,054
Oh no, from what Bree tells me,

703
00:32:03,138 --> 00:32:04,806
you're probably gonna
show me up out there.

704
00:32:04,890 --> 00:32:06,307
I don’t know about that.

705
00:32:31,208 --> 00:32:33,501
So how are you doing
with all this craziness?

706
00:32:33,585 --> 00:32:36,379
The guts are kind of
gross, but it is interesting.

707
00:32:36,463 --> 00:32:38,256
No, I mean between you and Thys.

708
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:40,883
I understand he took
you a quite by surprise.

709
00:32:42,970 --> 00:32:45,430
I think he was just trying
to make it special for me.

710
00:32:45,514 --> 00:32:46,889
Well that's our Thys,

711
00:32:46,974 --> 00:32:48,474
he never wants to miss an opportunity,

712
00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:51,686
but sometimes he jumps, doesn't
know where he's gonna land.

713
00:32:52,729 --> 00:32:54,814
Hope he didn’t scare you too badly.

714
00:32:54,898 --> 00:32:56,315
It's not that, it's just I...

715
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:57,608
And you don't have to defend him.

716
00:32:57,693 --> 00:32:59,777
I mean, he messed it up
and he knows it.

717
00:33:01,238 --> 00:33:05,283
But between me and my sous chef,

718
00:33:06,535 --> 00:33:08,828
I hope he has a chance to
make it right.

719
00:33:11,957 --> 00:33:14,041
It has been way too long.

720
00:33:14,126 --> 00:33:15,960
You've been great,
you haven't missed a beat.

721
00:33:17,796 --> 00:33:18,671
Well, we've got to head back in.

722
00:33:18,755 --> 00:33:20,590
I don't want to put it with Carrie.

723
00:33:20,674 --> 00:33:21,716
It looks like a lull anyway.

724
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:23,551
Real quick before we
head back inside,

725
00:33:23,635 --> 00:33:25,595
I owe you an apology.

726
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:26,846
For what?

727
00:33:26,930 --> 00:33:29,182
For proposing the Bree
without your permission.

728
00:33:29,266 --> 00:33:31,267
No, no, I don't know what
I was thinking.

729
00:33:31,351 --> 00:33:34,979
I heard some podcasts say that
it's an archaic sexist ritual

730
00:33:35,063 --> 00:33:36,022
to ask the father first.

731
00:33:36,106 --> 00:33:37,607
So I was really conflicted, you know?

732
00:33:37,691 --> 00:33:40,485
'Cause Brie's like really
into the whole feminist thing.

733
00:33:41,403 --> 00:33:42,653
So am I obviously.

734
00:33:42,738 --> 00:33:45,198
I mean I think everyone should be.

735
00:33:45,282 --> 00:33:46,949
Not everyone, if you're not,

736
00:33:47,034 --> 00:33:49,243
like that's totally like,
everyone's got a different

737
00:33:49,328 --> 00:33:52,121
like trajectory to the
same spot, you know?

738
00:33:52,206 --> 00:33:53,122
Like you might be one

739
00:33:53,207 --> 00:33:54,373
and you don't, it’s just about,
you know,

740
00:33:54,458 --> 00:33:58,085
valuing women are the
same, as we're equal.

741
00:33:58,170 --> 00:33:59,670
Mr. Carrington, what I'm trying

742
00:34:00,714 --> 00:34:03,216
to say is that I love
your daughter very much

743
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:05,635
and nothing would make me happier

744
00:34:05,719 --> 00:34:07,887
than if you gave me your
blessing to marry her.

745
00:34:23,028 --> 00:34:23,861
I got you.

746
00:34:31,828 --> 00:34:33,120
You good, are you okay?

747
00:34:33,205 --> 00:34:34,121
- Let's get you back inside.
- Yeah.

748
00:34:34,206 --> 00:34:34,956
Come on.

749
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:38,167
Hang on a second, you
got my permission.

750
00:34:38,252 --> 00:34:39,001
Are you sure?

751
00:34:39,086 --> 00:34:40,753
'Cause you probably concussed.

752
00:34:40,837 --> 00:34:41,796
Hey, you saved my life.

753
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:43,214
What am I gonna say?

754
00:34:43,298 --> 00:34:46,217
But don't get too excited, you
still need Carrie's blessing.

755
00:34:46,301 --> 00:34:49,220
But if this is what Bree
wants, you got my support.

756
00:34:50,472 --> 00:34:51,847
All right.

757
00:34:51,932 --> 00:34:54,684
Well the good news is

758
00:34:54,768 --> 00:34:57,228
you are not going to
need any stitches.

759
00:34:57,312 --> 00:34:58,062
That's great.

760
00:34:58,146 --> 00:34:59,480
But I went ahead
and sealed up the wound

761
00:34:59,565 --> 00:35:01,732
with some medical glue just in case.

762
00:35:01,817 --> 00:35:03,150
- Thanks.
- Okay, just gonna shine this

763
00:35:03,235 --> 00:35:04,151
in your eyes, okay?

764
00:35:04,236 --> 00:35:05,236
- Yeah.
- All right.

765
00:35:08,907 --> 00:35:10,992
Great, no concussion,

766
00:35:11,076 --> 00:35:13,494
but I’m going to keep an
eye on you just in case.

767
00:35:13,579 --> 00:35:14,787
- Thank you.
- Great.

768
00:35:14,871 --> 00:35:15,830
- My pleasure.
- Honey,

769
00:35:15,914 --> 00:35:17,039
what were you thinking?

770
00:35:17,124 --> 00:35:18,541
You could have drowned.

771
00:35:18,625 --> 00:35:20,084
He was in good hands.

772
00:35:20,168 --> 00:35:22,336
Thys is a Red Cross
certified lifeguard.

773
00:35:25,007 --> 00:35:26,382
There's the dinner gong.

774
00:35:26,466 --> 00:35:28,426
That means Scott must be ready for us.

775
00:35:28,510 --> 00:35:29,719
Hey listen, I hope you don't mind,

776
00:35:29,803 --> 00:35:31,679
I took the liberty of pulling out

777
00:35:31,763 --> 00:35:33,514
a pair of fresh shorts for you.

778
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:35,975
You're roughly the same
size as my Luke.

779
00:35:36,059 --> 00:35:37,476
Okay, why don't you guys go ahead

780
00:35:37,561 --> 00:35:39,437
and change and I'll meet
you out there.

781
00:35:39,521 --> 00:35:41,981
- Thank you so much.
- It's my greatest pleasure.

782
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:45,443
What was that all about?

783
00:35:45,527 --> 00:35:46,402
Well, I'm sorry.

784
00:35:46,486 --> 00:35:48,946
It wasn't planning on getting
pounded by an eight foot wave.

785
00:35:49,031 --> 00:35:50,197
I'm talking about this family.

786
00:35:50,282 --> 00:35:53,618
Something is up, I mean
this is next level kindness.

787
00:35:53,702 --> 00:35:55,036
Well maybe they're
just really great.

788
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:57,330
Look at all these throw
pillows, nobody's that perfect.

789
00:35:57,414 --> 00:35:58,497
Something has got to be
wrong with them.

790
00:35:58,582 --> 00:36:00,833
Okay, you told Bree you'd
give them a fair chance.

791
00:36:00,917 --> 00:36:02,501
I am giving them a fair chance

792
00:36:02,586 --> 00:36:03,836
and they're totally winning me over.

793
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:06,005
And that's not easy, so
what does that tell you?

794
00:36:06,089 --> 00:36:08,215
Be honest, do you think
that they put something

795
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:09,300
in our pina coladas?

796
00:36:09,384 --> 00:36:10,426
Okay, you're done.

797
00:36:12,596 --> 00:36:14,305
That’s the second gong.

798
00:36:14,389 --> 00:36:15,139
Okay, so I'm gonna change

799
00:36:15,223 --> 00:36:17,141
into Luke's shorts, which
are very nice by the way

800
00:36:17,225 --> 00:36:19,894
and I can go out there and
support our daughter Bree

801
00:36:19,978 --> 00:36:21,354
and I hope you join me.

802
00:36:21,438 --> 00:36:23,147
Fine, but you're
getting me a dinner gong

803
00:36:23,231 --> 00:36:24,982
and I don't care how much it costs.

804
00:36:36,328 --> 00:36:37,662
It's bone appetit in Japanese.

805
00:36:37,746 --> 00:36:39,455
Well eata tacomas to you too.

806
00:36:41,458 --> 00:36:42,500
This looks amazing.

807
00:36:42,584 --> 00:36:43,709
When you spend three years

808
00:36:43,794 --> 00:36:45,836
in Osaka, you pick up a thing or two.

809
00:36:45,921 --> 00:36:47,129
Oh, were you there for business?

810
00:36:47,214 --> 00:36:51,217
Technically yes, but it
was the Lord's business.

811
00:36:51,301 --> 00:36:52,968
Mom and dad were mission presidents

812
00:36:53,053 --> 00:36:55,137
in Osaka when I was in grade school.

813
00:36:55,222 --> 00:36:56,597
Of course they were.

814
00:36:56,682 --> 00:36:58,349
Shall we bless the food?

815
00:36:58,433 --> 00:36:59,642
- Yeah.
- Son, would you say it?

816
00:36:59,726 --> 00:37:01,185
Yeah, of course.

817
00:37:03,355 --> 00:37:04,146
Our dear father in heaven,

818
00:37:04,231 --> 00:37:07,525
we are very thankful to be here
with the Carrington family,

819
00:37:07,609 --> 00:37:10,528
thankful for their amazing daughter.

820
00:37:10,612 --> 00:37:12,863
She's been a blessing to
everyone at this table

821
00:37:12,948 --> 00:37:14,198
and then some.

822
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:16,701
We are thankful for the food,

823
00:37:16,785 --> 00:37:19,912
we ask you to please bless
the hands that prepared it.

824
00:37:19,996 --> 00:37:22,039
We're thankful for the
ocean that gave us this food

825
00:37:22,124 --> 00:37:25,084
and for the beautiful
place where we live.

826
00:37:25,168 --> 00:37:26,794
We'd ask you to bless us
with the spirit

827
00:37:26,878 --> 00:37:29,338
of love and friendship,
that we will truly be able

828
00:37:29,423 --> 00:37:31,090
to get to know each other tonight.

829
00:37:32,217 --> 00:37:33,509
We will also ask you to bless

830
00:37:33,593 --> 00:37:36,303
that those of us making
big life decisions may do

831
00:37:37,139 --> 00:37:39,849
so carefully and with the
guidance of the Holy Spirit.

832
00:37:40,684 --> 00:37:43,978
We say these things in the
name of Jesus Christ, amen.

833
00:37:44,062 --> 00:37:46,021
Well, it's been wonderful
to get to know you, Bree.

834
00:37:46,106 --> 00:37:47,857
It's just been a treat for us

835
00:37:47,941 --> 00:37:51,652
and to bring your parents
with too, it's really nice

836
00:37:51,737 --> 00:37:53,946
to meet you and know what
a terrific job you've done

837
00:37:54,030 --> 00:37:55,239
in raising your daughter.

838
00:37:55,323 --> 00:37:57,366
You can't know what she means to us.

839
00:37:58,660 --> 00:37:59,785
Excuse me for a second,

840
00:37:59,870 --> 00:38:02,580
I'm gonna go outside
to get some fresh air.

841
00:38:02,664 --> 00:38:03,914
- I'll join you.
- Great.

842
00:38:08,462 --> 00:38:11,839
Aren't they're just the most
adorable couple in the world?

843
00:38:13,341 --> 00:38:15,551
I remember when you used
to look at me like that.

844
00:38:15,635 --> 00:38:17,178
Oh, I still do.

845
00:38:20,682 --> 00:38:22,808
You must be so jet lagged.

846
00:38:22,893 --> 00:38:24,310
Oh, it's fine.

847
00:38:24,394 --> 00:38:26,353
I am looking forward to a good
night's rest though tonight.

848
00:38:26,438 --> 00:38:28,063
So are you staying, Turtle Bay?

849
00:38:28,148 --> 00:38:29,648
- No.
- The Marriott?

850
00:38:29,733 --> 00:38:31,317
Well not...

851
00:38:31,401 --> 00:38:32,943
We actually don't get to
spend much time

852
00:38:33,028 --> 00:38:35,237
with Bree these days, so
we're gonna crash at her pad.

853
00:38:35,322 --> 00:38:37,281
Nonsense, you're staying
in our guest house.

854
00:38:37,365 --> 00:38:38,574
- Yeah.
- Oh no, yeah, no,

855
00:38:38,658 --> 00:38:39,492
we'll be fine, it's fine.

856
00:38:39,576 --> 00:38:41,494
We insist, end of discussion.

857
00:38:42,579 --> 00:38:45,498
- Okay, okay, thank you.
- Okay, thank you.

858
00:38:45,582 --> 00:38:46,791
I'm onto you, mister.

859
00:38:46,875 --> 00:38:47,625
What are you talking about?

860
00:38:47,709 --> 00:38:51,045
Just taking my dad
surfing and saving his life.

861
00:38:51,129 --> 00:38:52,671
- Is it working?
- On my dad,

862
00:38:52,756 --> 00:38:55,090
but the jury is still out on my mom.

863
00:38:55,175 --> 00:38:56,801
I asked your dad for permission.

864
00:38:56,885 --> 00:38:58,385
- Really?
- Yes.

865
00:38:58,470 --> 00:38:59,386
I'm trying to make it right.

866
00:38:59,471 --> 00:39:01,806
Well what did he say?

867
00:39:01,890 --> 00:39:03,641
He said he trusts you

868
00:39:03,725 --> 00:39:06,644
and that if this is what
you really want,

869
00:39:07,687 --> 00:39:09,146
I have his blessing.

870
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:15,736
Ask me again.

871
00:39:16,696 --> 00:39:17,655
Wait, what?

872
00:39:17,739 --> 00:39:20,366
Get on your knee and ask me again.

873
00:39:23,370 --> 00:39:26,372
Bree Christine Carrington,
will you marry me?

874
00:39:28,041 --> 00:39:29,708
- Yes.
- Yes?

875
00:39:29,793 --> 00:39:31,418
For real this time.

876
00:39:33,547 --> 00:39:35,422
Shizah, I put my best bottle

877
00:39:35,507 --> 00:39:40,094
of Martinelli's on ice just
in case we had a reason

878
00:39:40,178 --> 00:39:43,180
to celebrate and I am
sure glad that I did.

879
00:39:44,516 --> 00:39:46,141
Many, many years ago...

880
00:39:46,226 --> 00:39:47,810
May I have the honors?

881
00:39:48,687 --> 00:39:50,020
- Of course.
- Thank you.

882
00:39:50,105 --> 00:39:53,274
First of all, I just feel
like I need to apologize.

883
00:39:53,358 --> 00:39:56,193
I started the day off as
a real negative Nancy.

884
00:39:56,278 --> 00:40:00,114
Bree, I have tried to teach
you correct principles

885
00:40:00,198 --> 00:40:04,577
and help you make good choices
and you've never let me down.

886
00:40:04,661 --> 00:40:06,787
I trust your decision and I'm proud

887
00:40:06,872 --> 00:40:10,791
to share you with Thys
and this amazing family.

888
00:40:10,876 --> 00:40:12,626
I admit that I am a hard nut

889
00:40:12,711 --> 00:40:16,130
to crack but once I'm in, I'm all in.

890
00:40:16,214 --> 00:40:17,172
I'll drink to that.

891
00:40:17,257 --> 00:40:19,717
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

892
00:40:19,801 --> 00:40:21,510
I hate to break up a good party,

893
00:40:21,595 --> 00:40:24,096
but we'd better get
planning the wedding.

894
00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:26,807
February 13 is but less
than two months away.

895
00:40:27,726 --> 00:40:28,517
Two months?

896
00:40:29,853 --> 00:40:33,272
February 13th, the 13th of February.

897
00:40:34,482 --> 00:40:36,025
Two, one, three.

898
00:40:37,110 --> 00:40:38,527
Mum, it's okay.

899
00:40:39,571 --> 00:40:40,571
Bree, why didn't you
tell your mother

900
00:40:40,655 --> 00:40:41,989
you already had a day picked out?

901
00:40:42,073 --> 00:40:43,490
- Dad, I...
- Because she didn't know.

902
00:40:43,575 --> 00:40:44,867
I talked to my parents about it

903
00:40:44,951 --> 00:40:48,412
but I didn't have the chance
to talk to Bree yet, sorry.

904
00:40:48,496 --> 00:40:51,248
I thought we should wait
til the semester is over.

905
00:40:51,333 --> 00:40:53,667
Well it's just a
simple miscommunication.

906
00:40:53,752 --> 00:40:56,170
But we're all here, so why
don't we just pick a day

907
00:40:56,254 --> 00:40:58,380
that works better for everybody?

908
00:40:58,465 --> 00:41:01,175
Great idea Curt 'cause
I gave it a shot

909
00:41:01,259 --> 00:41:02,760
and it's just not gonna work.

910
00:41:02,844 --> 00:41:03,886
No matter how I read it

911
00:41:03,970 --> 00:41:06,597
or say it, it's just not
numerically aesthetic

912
00:41:06,681 --> 00:41:08,474
and hello, the 13th?

913
00:41:08,558 --> 00:41:11,769
Who wants to start their
marriage together on unlucky day?

914
00:41:11,853 --> 00:41:14,521
Well actually worked
out okay for us.

915
00:41:14,606 --> 00:41:16,023
And your parents too.

916
00:41:16,107 --> 00:41:18,734
Oh, let me guess, and
your grandma too.

917
00:41:18,818 --> 00:41:20,402
Actually.

918
00:41:20,487 --> 00:41:22,905
You all chose February 13th.

919
00:41:22,989 --> 00:41:25,908
I wouldn't say it was a
choice per se.

920
00:41:25,992 --> 00:41:26,825
It was...

921
00:41:30,288 --> 00:41:34,124
You see, it was the day after
the Pearl Harbor attack.

922
00:41:35,210 --> 00:41:38,671
My grandpa Glenn, he'd lied
about his age and he enlisted

923
00:41:39,798 --> 00:41:42,508
in the Marines and as fate
would have it, he was called

924
00:41:42,592 --> 00:41:46,261
to action the following
Valentine's day, 1942.

925
00:41:47,973 --> 00:41:51,684
He was only 17, so his
parents wouldn't let him marry

926
00:41:51,768 --> 00:41:53,185
his sweetheart, Clarice.

927
00:41:54,396 --> 00:41:58,983
So they eloped the day before.

928
00:41:59,067 --> 00:42:00,943
February 13th.

929
00:42:01,987 --> 00:42:04,989
Unfortunately a couple
of months after he received

930
00:42:05,073 --> 00:42:07,741
the Congressional Medal
of Honor for bravery,

931
00:42:07,826 --> 00:42:10,869
he went missing in
action in the Philippines

932
00:42:10,954 --> 00:42:13,831
and was never seen again.

933
00:42:15,417 --> 00:42:17,835
But luckily for us,

934
00:42:17,919 --> 00:42:21,630
his wedding night had been well,
fruitful.

935
00:42:23,049 --> 00:42:26,760
So you can see why Thys
chose the 13th,

936
00:42:26,845 --> 00:42:28,429
to honor their wedding.

937
00:42:30,098 --> 00:42:31,390
Thys, I love that you thought

938
00:42:31,474 --> 00:42:36,437
about that and gosh, so
special, but it's so soon

939
00:42:37,022 --> 00:42:40,274
and we really should be
deciding these things together.

940
00:42:41,401 --> 00:42:42,651
Right, yeah.

941
00:42:42,736 --> 00:42:44,695
When were you thinking?

942
00:42:46,990 --> 00:42:49,575
Okay, what about April 25th?

943
00:42:49,659 --> 00:42:50,743
I mean the semester will be

944
00:42:50,827 --> 00:42:53,370
over and I've always really
wanted a spring wedding.

945
00:42:53,455 --> 00:42:54,747
I love that idea.

946
00:42:54,831 --> 00:42:57,458
Except my parents have there
Nourish the Children trip

947
00:42:57,542 --> 00:42:58,375
starting in March.

948
00:42:58,460 --> 00:42:59,668
How long does it last?

949
00:42:59,753 --> 00:43:01,712
Six months.

950
00:43:01,796 --> 00:43:04,089
Okay, how about the
end of September then?

951
00:43:04,174 --> 00:43:05,049
Oh, I love fall.

952
00:43:05,133 --> 00:43:06,550
Babe, that's a
nine month engagement.

953
00:43:06,634 --> 00:43:07,384
So?

954
00:43:07,469 --> 00:43:08,510
Some people consider nine months

955
00:43:08,595 --> 00:43:09,845
to be a really short engagement.

956
00:43:09,929 --> 00:43:11,597
Yeah, they're called Catholics.

957
00:43:11,681 --> 00:43:14,016
I don’t want to get married
in the dead of winter, Thys.

958
00:43:14,100 --> 00:43:16,226
Okay so we could get
married out here.

959
00:43:16,311 --> 00:43:17,311
- You know my granny
- The sooner this happens,

960
00:43:17,395 --> 00:43:18,645
- the pricier it's gonna get.
- Can't travel.

961
00:43:18,730 --> 00:43:20,814
If cost is a problem,
we can help with that.

962
00:43:20,899 --> 00:43:21,815
Is my dad seriously

963
00:43:21,900 --> 00:43:22,816
- talking about money right now?
- I'm not saying that.

964
00:43:22,901 --> 00:43:24,109
Thys, we've waited this long.

965
00:43:24,194 --> 00:43:25,402
Let's wait, what's the big deal

966
00:43:25,487 --> 00:43:26,945
about waiting another nine months?

967
00:43:31,868 --> 00:43:33,160
Everybody, settle down.

968
00:43:33,995 --> 00:43:38,248
As mother of the bride, I
invoke executive decision.

969
00:43:38,333 --> 00:43:40,334
Eight weeks is a ridiculous amount

970
00:43:40,418 --> 00:43:42,044
of time to plan a wedding,

971
00:43:42,128 --> 00:43:44,088
especially if we're gonna do it right

972
00:43:44,172 --> 00:43:48,175
and make it special in the
dead of winter mind you.

973
00:43:48,259 --> 00:43:51,428
I would have to call in every
favor anyone ever owed me

974
00:43:51,513 --> 00:43:52,971
and pressure all of my friends

975
00:43:54,140 --> 00:43:56,725
to work non-stop in order to
plan and execute it properly,

976
00:43:56,810 --> 00:43:58,644
it would be insane.

977
00:43:58,728 --> 00:44:01,980
But if anyone can do it,
Carrie Carrington can.

978
00:44:03,233 --> 00:44:04,483
Chock it up.

979
00:44:04,567 --> 00:44:08,821
In honor of Glen and
Clarice, February 13th it is.

980
00:44:08,905 --> 00:44:10,614
Oh wonderful.

981
00:44:10,698 --> 00:44:12,241
Did she just referred to
herself in the third person?

982
00:44:12,325 --> 00:44:13,367
I just go with it.

983
00:44:13,451 --> 00:44:16,537
Now somebody get me a binder.

984
00:44:16,621 --> 00:44:19,081
Okay, did you see that shower?

985
00:44:19,165 --> 00:44:21,291
There's like 12 nozzles.

986
00:44:21,376 --> 00:44:24,336
This is the guest house, wow.

987
00:44:26,589 --> 00:44:29,424
Now how did Monica have
this all ready to go?

988
00:44:30,635 --> 00:44:32,719
Well, we called it homemaking night

989
00:44:32,804 --> 00:44:34,513
in the 90s, it's what we did.

990
00:44:34,597 --> 00:44:35,848
Poor thing didn't have any daughters,

991
00:44:35,932 --> 00:44:37,516
so this is her last chance to use it.

992
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:39,810
Well, well, did someone
changed their tone?

993
00:44:39,894 --> 00:44:41,436
No, what can I say?

994
00:44:41,521 --> 00:44:42,813
They're amazing.

995
00:44:42,897 --> 00:44:45,190
I think she's my spirit animal.

996
00:44:45,275 --> 00:44:47,025
I thought your
spirit animal was a cougar.

997
00:44:47,110 --> 00:44:49,361
Well she's that too.

998
00:44:50,321 --> 00:44:52,781
How amazing does she look for her age?

999
00:44:52,866 --> 00:44:54,533
Well she's no Carrie Carrington.

1000
00:44:57,203 --> 00:44:59,663
Hey, what'd you say we go

1001
00:44:59,747 --> 00:45:02,082
to bed and you can finish that later?

1002
00:45:02,167 --> 00:45:02,916
Later?

1003
00:45:03,001 --> 00:45:04,126
There is no later.

1004
00:45:04,210 --> 00:45:06,670
We have 36 hours to take advantage

1005
00:45:06,754 --> 00:45:08,005
of everything that we need to do here.

1006
00:45:08,089 --> 00:45:11,633
Well, how about taking
advantage of this amazing place

1007
00:45:11,718 --> 00:45:12,926
before things get crazy?

1008
00:45:13,011 --> 00:45:15,220
Too late, bub, things
are already crazy.

1009
00:45:15,305 --> 00:45:19,224
Besides I'm in business
mode, not surfs up dude mode.

1010
00:45:19,309 --> 00:45:20,642
Right, right, yep.

1011
00:45:20,727 --> 00:45:23,145
Well our oldest daughter
is getting married

1012
00:45:23,229 --> 00:45:25,606
and there is no time to celebrate love

1013
00:45:25,690 --> 00:45:28,358
or the union of souls.

1014
00:45:28,443 --> 00:45:30,652
Oh please, I
know what kind

1015
00:45:30,737 --> 00:45:32,446
of union of souls you wanna celebrate.

1016
00:45:32,530 --> 00:45:34,698
We need to have a clear plan
if we're gonna pull this off.

1017
00:45:34,782 --> 00:45:37,326
Oh yeah, what if I pull this off?

1018
00:45:39,829 --> 00:45:41,538
Come on baby, let's go.

1019
00:45:41,623 --> 00:45:45,083
Valiant effort, dude, but
it's gonna have to wait.

1020
00:45:45,168 --> 00:45:47,878
Besides I'm about to
put my grind guard in.

1021
00:45:49,756 --> 00:45:52,299
Pouting only hurts your chances.

1022
00:45:53,718 --> 00:45:56,595
The key to victory is
to divide and conquer.

1023
00:45:56,679 --> 00:45:58,889
I know we haven't
finalized the exact venue

1024
00:45:58,973 --> 00:46:00,140
or event details,

1025
00:46:00,225 --> 00:46:02,351
but we can at least
finalize the guest list

1026
00:46:02,435 --> 00:46:03,727
and collect addresses.

1027
00:46:03,811 --> 00:46:05,562
Monica and I will take the lead.

1028
00:46:06,397 --> 00:46:10,275
We also need to shoot and
finalize the engagement photos.

1029
00:46:10,360 --> 00:46:12,778
Make sure you choose a
photog you can trust.

1030
00:46:12,862 --> 00:46:14,905
Thys, fix your face,
you look constipated.

1031
00:46:14,989 --> 00:46:17,074
Can someone remind me why
we're doing this in the studio?

1032
00:46:17,158 --> 00:46:18,033
We live in Hawaii,

1033
00:46:18,117 --> 00:46:19,868
we already have the best
backdrops in the country.

1034
00:46:19,953 --> 00:46:21,954
Okay, well someone
wanted a winter wedding,

1035
00:46:22,038 --> 00:46:23,664
so we need a winter setting.

1036
00:46:23,748 --> 00:46:25,082
Okay, enough arguing.

1037
00:46:25,166 --> 00:46:27,125
Mama C gave me a 24 hour turnaround,

1038
00:46:27,210 --> 00:46:29,586
so I'll just fix it all in post.

1039
00:46:29,671 --> 00:46:31,588
Face the fan and pretend
you're in love.

1040
00:46:33,007 --> 00:46:35,133
Crank it, Maurice.

1041
00:46:35,218 --> 00:46:36,843
Smile Bree, awesome.

1042
00:46:37,679 --> 00:46:38,887
Thys, your face.

1043
00:46:38,972 --> 00:46:41,139
Curt and Scott,
don't be discouraged,

1044
00:46:41,224 --> 00:46:44,017
but I need you to take
care of the boring stuff,

1045
00:46:44,102 --> 00:46:45,644
mostly phone calls.

1046
00:46:45,728 --> 00:46:48,313
Plot your information on
the detailed spreadsheet

1047
00:46:48,398 --> 00:46:49,189
I've prepared for you.

1048
00:46:49,274 --> 00:46:51,483
- February 13th?
- Correct.

1049
00:46:51,567 --> 00:46:52,776
I know it's a long story.

1050
00:46:53,820 --> 00:46:55,362
It's available?

1051
00:46:55,446 --> 00:46:56,947
That’s amazing, can we
put a hold on it?

1052
00:46:57,031 --> 00:46:58,782
I'm sorry, February 13th this year.

1053
00:46:59,701 --> 00:47:00,784
When you finish that,

1054
00:47:00,868 --> 00:47:02,995
call the list of preselected temples

1055
00:47:03,079 --> 00:47:05,038
that Thys and Bree have
provided you with.

1056
00:47:05,123 --> 00:47:08,542
Find the open ceiling times
and available officiators.

1057
00:47:09,919 --> 00:47:11,253
This will be tough,

1058
00:47:11,337 --> 00:47:13,630
but we're counting on
you guys to come through.

1059
00:47:15,008 --> 00:47:16,925
This is my favorite,

1060
00:47:17,010 --> 00:47:18,468
definitely the most cinematic.

1061
00:47:18,553 --> 00:47:19,845
Supposed to be an engagement photo,

1062
00:47:19,929 --> 00:47:21,638
not a film noir poster.

1063
00:47:21,723 --> 00:47:22,681
What about this?

1064
00:47:22,765 --> 00:47:24,516
Oh, I like that, I
look good in that one.

1065
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:25,559
Are you serious?

1066
00:47:25,643 --> 00:47:26,727
It's not about you, Thys.

1067
00:47:26,811 --> 00:47:28,061
No one cares about the dude.

1068
00:47:28,146 --> 00:47:28,895
Perfect, print it.

1069
00:47:28,980 --> 00:47:31,106
It there's
always the classic collage.

1070
00:47:31,190 --> 00:47:34,985
When you love yourself so much,
you can't just choose one.

1071
00:47:35,069 --> 00:47:36,611
Tempting, but no.

1072
00:47:36,696 --> 00:47:40,657
Or you could just go with this.

1073
00:47:44,704 --> 00:47:45,996
It's perfect.

1074
00:47:47,498 --> 00:47:51,209
♪ I am somewhere in the sand ♪

1075
00:47:51,294 --> 00:47:53,462
♪ And I wish I was an ocean ♪

1076
00:47:53,546 --> 00:47:55,672
Where have you been all day?

1077
00:47:55,757 --> 00:47:58,008
Well I'm sorry, did you
not check the Google doc?

1078
00:47:58,092 --> 00:47:59,551
You'd have to nominate me for an Oscar

1079
00:47:59,635 --> 00:48:02,637
'cause I'm done so Donso
Washington, thank you very much.

1080
00:48:02,722 --> 00:48:04,139
All right, I stand correct.

1081
00:48:05,016 --> 00:48:07,684
Hey, I've got another
hour rental on the scooter.

1082
00:48:07,769 --> 00:48:08,977
Wanna head up the coast?

1083
00:48:09,062 --> 00:48:10,854
Don't push it, come on, chop, chop.

1084
00:48:14,984 --> 00:48:17,235
I don't think that there's
any way we can pair this down,

1085
00:48:17,320 --> 00:48:18,904
- do you?
- No, I agree.

1086
00:48:18,988 --> 00:48:21,740
So we have 753 for the reception.

1087
00:48:21,824 --> 00:48:23,533
And what, 100 for the luncheon?

1088
00:48:23,618 --> 00:48:25,535
What are you thinking
about the luncheon?

1089
00:48:25,620 --> 00:48:26,578
Something the day off?

1090
00:48:26,662 --> 00:48:30,123
Scott and I were thinking
of dinner the day before.

1091
00:48:30,208 --> 00:48:32,292
We just have so many
people traveling in.

1092
00:48:32,377 --> 00:48:37,130
It would just be family
and the wedding party

1093
00:48:37,215 --> 00:48:38,882
oh, and a few VIPs perhaps.

1094
00:48:38,966 --> 00:48:41,218
Well let me know if you
need any help planning it.

1095
00:48:41,302 --> 00:48:44,471
Listen, you have your plate
so full with everything else.

1096
00:48:44,555 --> 00:48:46,473
We'll handle the dinner, okay?

1097
00:48:46,557 --> 00:48:47,808
Probably keep it simple.

1098
00:48:47,892 --> 00:48:49,434
Just I don't know,

1099
00:48:49,519 --> 00:48:52,521
book a restaurant or the
governor's mansion, we'll see.

1100
00:48:55,566 --> 00:48:56,900
Are you okay?

1101
00:48:56,984 --> 00:48:57,734
Yeah, I'm sorry.

1102
00:48:57,819 --> 00:49:01,488
Sometimes I get so focused
that I forget to tinkle.

1103
00:49:01,572 --> 00:49:02,989
Oh my goodness, of course.

1104
00:49:03,074 --> 00:49:05,283
Down the hall and to your left.

1105
00:49:05,368 --> 00:49:06,868
Thank you.

1106
00:49:34,147 --> 00:49:34,980
Okay.

1107
00:49:36,941 --> 00:49:38,358
Sorry about that.

1108
00:49:39,193 --> 00:49:41,361
I got a really cool it
with the LaCroixs,

1109
00:49:41,446 --> 00:49:43,071
you know what I mean?

1110
00:49:43,156 --> 00:49:45,532
Fun family photo wall in there.

1111
00:49:45,616 --> 00:49:47,117
Oh nice, right?

1112
00:49:47,201 --> 00:49:49,161
Yeah, who's the family
that you're with?

1113
00:49:49,245 --> 00:49:50,537
Oh, those are the Lees,

1114
00:49:50,621 --> 00:49:52,622
they're our oldest and
dearest friends.

1115
00:49:52,707 --> 00:49:55,208
Mark's been friends with Scott since,
boy,

1116
00:49:55,293 --> 00:49:56,668
- I guess high school.
- Really?

1117
00:49:56,752 --> 00:49:58,462
Yes, they're on the invite list.

1118
00:49:58,546 --> 00:49:59,963
Of course.

1119
00:50:00,047 --> 00:50:03,300
Unfortunately, I'm not sure
they'll be able to make it.

1120
00:50:03,384 --> 00:50:05,677
Bridget gets released about
a week before the wedding.

1121
00:50:05,761 --> 00:50:07,345
So they might just happen

1122
00:50:07,430 --> 00:50:10,724
to be in Barcelona that week
if you know what I mean.

1123
00:50:10,808 --> 00:50:12,225
How did she take the news?

1124
00:50:12,310 --> 00:50:13,727
I mean from about Thys.

1125
00:50:14,896 --> 00:50:17,856
She doesn't know yet but
that's only because I told Thys

1126
00:50:17,940 --> 00:50:20,567
that a proper Dear Jane
letter should be hand written

1127
00:50:20,651 --> 00:50:21,902
out of respect.

1128
00:50:21,986 --> 00:50:23,904
Well, I hope she takes it well.

1129
00:50:23,988 --> 00:50:25,614
She'll be fine.

1130
00:50:25,698 --> 00:50:27,491
She is such a catch.

1131
00:50:27,575 --> 00:50:28,492
When she comes back,

1132
00:50:28,576 --> 00:50:30,994
she'll have her pick up
any young man she wants.

1133
00:50:31,078 --> 00:50:34,289
Well, Bree's quite the
catch herself.

1134
00:50:34,373 --> 00:50:35,290
Mom, look.

1135
00:50:36,334 --> 00:50:37,667
Oh gosh.

1136
00:50:37,752 --> 00:50:39,878
- You okay?
- Yeah, it's no big deal.

1137
00:50:39,962 --> 00:50:41,880
Do you still feel good about this?

1138
00:50:41,964 --> 00:50:44,007
Yeah, yeah, I mean
it's been a little crazy,

1139
00:50:44,091 --> 00:50:45,717
but we knew it would be that way.

1140
00:50:46,594 --> 00:50:48,762
I don't want our
engagement to be crazy.

1141
00:50:48,846 --> 00:50:52,349
No, no, I just
meant like with scheduling.

1142
00:50:52,433 --> 00:50:53,475
- It'll be fun.
- Okay.

1143
00:50:55,311 --> 00:50:57,312
I wish you were coming
with me tonight.

1144
00:50:58,356 --> 00:51:00,398
I can't believe we're
spending Christmas apart.

1145
00:51:00,483 --> 00:51:02,275
I know, hey,
but the good news

1146
00:51:02,360 --> 00:51:05,529
is that it's not gonna happen again.

1147
00:51:07,031 --> 00:51:09,491
- Last time.
- True, true.

1148
00:51:10,535 --> 00:51:11,701
All right, we
should probably get you

1149
00:51:11,786 --> 00:51:12,953
to the airport.

1150
00:51:13,037 --> 00:51:15,539
No, no, just a
few more minutes.

1151
00:51:19,293 --> 00:51:21,461
You still felt good about all this?

1152
00:51:21,546 --> 00:51:24,714
As good as I can, this is life.

1153
00:51:24,799 --> 00:51:27,509
Our parents trusted us, I
guess we gotta trust them.

1154
00:51:27,593 --> 00:51:29,553
I mean they're adults, right?

1155
00:51:29,637 --> 00:51:30,428
Technically.

1156
00:51:33,474 --> 00:51:35,267
I wonder what the
Chesterfields are thinking

1157
00:51:35,351 --> 00:51:36,101
about all this.

1158
00:51:36,185 --> 00:51:38,228
Oh, I bet they're just
as stressed as we are.

1159
00:51:40,189 --> 00:51:42,023
We have got to hit the ground running.

1160
00:51:42,108 --> 00:51:43,942
Come here just a minute.

1161
00:51:46,862 --> 00:51:49,948
I'm sorry that I was
short with you earlier.

1162
00:51:50,032 --> 00:51:52,492
I'm so glad that you got
the temple appointment

1163
00:51:52,577 --> 00:51:54,786
and the country club squared away.

1164
00:51:54,870 --> 00:51:56,371
Oh, about that.

1165
00:51:56,455 --> 00:51:58,081
Don't tell me they cancel.

1166
00:51:58,165 --> 00:51:59,708
No, no, they didn't cancel,

1167
00:51:59,792 --> 00:52:02,711
but I don't know if it's
worth the money.

1168
00:52:03,546 --> 00:52:05,922
I thought they gave you
the Chesterfield discount.

1169
00:52:06,007 --> 00:52:07,882
Yeah well I guess
some people's definition

1170
00:52:07,967 --> 00:52:10,385
of discount is different than others.

1171
00:52:10,469 --> 00:52:11,845
Well if you're so
worried about money,

1172
00:52:11,929 --> 00:52:14,097
then why are you buying
all these crappy souvenirs?

1173
00:52:14,181 --> 00:52:15,849
These are for the kids.

1174
00:52:15,933 --> 00:52:17,142
I spent tens of dollars

1175
00:52:17,226 --> 00:52:19,853
on this, not tens of
thousands of dollars.

1176
00:52:20,855 --> 00:52:24,107
I just, I think that we should
find a low budge solution.

1177
00:52:24,191 --> 00:52:26,359
You want our daughter's
wedding to be low budge?

1178
00:52:26,444 --> 00:52:28,236
Do you think I wanted to
be unemployed right now?

1179
00:52:28,321 --> 00:52:31,072
I didn't exactly ask Randy
to cancel my contract.

1180
00:52:31,157 --> 00:52:32,616
He was supposed to take care of us.

1181
00:52:32,700 --> 00:52:36,745
It was a startup, it
failed, I mean that happens.

1182
00:52:36,829 --> 00:52:38,330
How long are we gonna be poor?

1183
00:52:38,414 --> 00:52:39,956
We're not poor, Carrie.

1184
00:52:40,041 --> 00:52:43,460
Well we can't afford that
venue for our daughters wedding.

1185
00:52:43,544 --> 00:52:44,419
What do you call that?

1186
00:52:44,503 --> 00:52:45,795
I didn't say that.

1187
00:52:45,880 --> 00:52:48,006
I just say we need to come up

1188
00:52:48,090 --> 00:52:49,841
with a contingency plan, that's all.

1189
00:52:49,925 --> 00:52:50,717
Fine.

1190
00:52:52,678 --> 00:52:54,971
Thys is gonna pull the car around,
okay?

1191
00:52:55,056 --> 00:52:56,222
Is everything okay?

1192
00:52:56,307 --> 00:52:58,350
- Yes, of course.
- Of course.

1193
00:53:02,605 --> 00:53:05,357
Thank you both so much.

1194
00:53:05,441 --> 00:53:06,191
I couldn't imagine doing this

1195
00:53:06,275 --> 00:53:08,777
without you, but I'm
getting really excited.

1196
00:53:08,861 --> 00:53:11,071
Oh yeah?

1197
00:53:11,155 --> 00:53:12,614
I love you both so much.

1198
00:53:15,159 --> 00:53:17,786
You really think
we can pull this off?

1199
00:53:17,870 --> 00:53:18,828
- Yes.
- Oh yeah.

1200
00:53:20,873 --> 00:53:23,792
But we're gonna need our girls.

1201
00:53:41,143 --> 00:53:42,811
Are you sure you're not
feeling jet lagged, Carrie?

1202
00:53:42,895 --> 00:53:45,021
We can always start
this tomorrow, you know?

1203
00:53:45,106 --> 00:53:46,815
- Yeah.
- Please, please,

1204
00:53:46,899 --> 00:53:49,025
forgive me for what I'm
about to reveal to you.

1205
00:53:49,110 --> 00:53:51,236
It is the biggest cause
of shame I have

1206
00:53:51,320 --> 00:53:53,780
in my life, but there
are no other options.

1207
00:54:00,246 --> 00:54:01,746
I promise we'll finish it one day.

1208
00:54:01,831 --> 00:54:04,457
The timing is just never right,
you know?

1209
00:54:06,377 --> 00:54:09,295
Who knows that's what
the boys do down here.

1210
00:54:09,380 --> 00:54:10,380
I feel so vulnerable.

1211
00:54:11,424 --> 00:54:12,966
At least no one
will bother us.

1212
00:54:13,050 --> 00:54:14,801
Except for maybe a few
brave spiders.

1213
00:54:14,885 --> 00:54:15,802
This was a mistake.

1214
00:54:15,886 --> 00:54:17,721
I'm gonna kick Curt
out of his home office.

1215
00:54:17,805 --> 00:54:19,305
- No, it's perfect.
- No, no, no.

1216
00:54:19,390 --> 00:54:20,765
Look, we're all set up here.

1217
00:54:20,850 --> 00:54:23,601
I really appreciate both of you.

1218
00:54:23,686 --> 00:54:24,436
I couldn't do this without you.

1219
00:54:24,520 --> 00:54:25,770
I mean, it just means a world

1220
00:54:25,855 --> 00:54:27,021
to me that you would drop everything

1221
00:54:27,106 --> 00:54:28,648
- just to help me.
- Enough with the chit-chat.

1222
00:54:28,733 --> 00:54:30,650
I've got a hard out at 1800 hours.

1223
00:54:30,735 --> 00:54:32,736
It's Jazz versus the Nuggets tonight

1224
00:54:32,820 --> 00:54:34,821
and Bud got us court side seats.

1225
00:54:34,905 --> 00:54:38,283
So let's plan the heck
out of this thing.

1226
00:54:38,367 --> 00:54:40,034
All right, let's pound it.

1227
00:54:41,996 --> 00:54:43,329
Will we ever learn?

1228
00:54:44,373 --> 00:54:45,957
Kat, guess who's back.

1229
00:54:46,041 --> 00:54:47,333
At first, she totally wanted

1230
00:54:47,418 --> 00:54:49,335
to kill me, but now she's all in now.

1231
00:54:49,420 --> 00:54:50,587
You know that even though she's

1232
00:54:50,671 --> 00:54:54,382
on her mission, Paige is
my official maid of honor.

1233
00:54:54,467 --> 00:54:56,634
It's a pact we made for each
other in the seventh grade

1234
00:54:56,719 --> 00:54:58,136
and I have to honor that,

1235
00:54:58,220 --> 00:55:02,223
but I wanted to ask you if you
would be my first bridesmaid?

1236
00:55:02,308 --> 00:55:04,434
D.C., yeah, wow.

1237
00:55:04,518 --> 00:55:06,728
What an amazing opportunity for you.

1238
00:55:06,812 --> 00:55:07,896
No, no, not at all,

1239
00:55:07,980 --> 00:55:10,273
just remember me when you're
running for president.

1240
00:55:10,357 --> 00:55:12,650
Trinity, what's up girl?

1241
00:55:12,735 --> 00:55:16,738
Yeah, Thys, T H, Y, S, it's Dutch.

1242
00:55:16,822 --> 00:55:19,657
Jenny, my cousin went
two years ago actually

1243
00:55:19,742 --> 00:55:21,034
and she really loved it.

1244
00:55:21,118 --> 00:55:23,536
So I think you're gonna love it.

1245
00:55:23,621 --> 00:55:27,123
Ashley, I just can’t believe
you're gonna be gone.

1246
00:55:27,208 --> 00:55:29,209
But Erica, what up?

1247
00:55:30,419 --> 00:55:32,045
I did always want a spring wedding.

1248
00:55:32,129 --> 00:55:35,548
In total, six months, but
honestly it feels like forever.

1249
00:55:35,633 --> 00:55:40,595
Sarah, Lisa, Haley, Taylor, Hi,
it's Bree.

1250
00:55:49,188 --> 00:55:53,024
I thought camp was complicated,
but this is next level.

1251
00:55:53,108 --> 00:55:54,317
She's only just begun.

1252
00:55:56,237 --> 00:55:58,488
I hope Bree appreciates all this.

1253
00:55:59,615 --> 00:56:01,241
Where is that little diva anyway?

1254
00:56:01,325 --> 00:56:03,409
Oh, I'm sure has her
own to do lists.

1255
00:56:05,496 --> 00:56:07,413
Do you think she would
miss me if I went out

1256
00:56:07,498 --> 00:56:08,706
and got some snacks?

1257
00:56:09,917 --> 00:56:12,001
I'll take some Flaming Hot Ruffles

1258
00:56:12,086 --> 00:56:13,920
and a Wild Cherry Pepsi.

1259
00:56:14,004 --> 00:56:15,421
Here, take the hog.

1260
00:56:15,506 --> 00:56:16,339
You'll be quicker.

1261
00:56:17,174 --> 00:56:18,132
I'll cover for you.

1262
00:56:24,598 --> 00:56:26,891
Don't even think twice about it.

1263
00:56:26,976 --> 00:56:30,728
You're not missing a Disney
cruise for my wedding.

1264
00:56:46,579 --> 00:56:49,289
You guys, thank you so
much for inviting me.

1265
00:56:49,373 --> 00:56:52,166
I figured it was time
we all got together again.

1266
00:56:52,251 --> 00:56:54,002
After you.

1267
00:56:54,086 --> 00:56:55,879
Oh thank you, Phoebe.

1268
00:56:55,963 --> 00:56:58,756

So are you going to
have babies soon?

1278
00:57:19,862 --> 00:57:21,571
'Cause I'm like a really
good babysitter.

1279
00:57:21,655 --> 00:57:22,697
- Very, veery good.
- If you have too many,

1280
00:57:22,781 --> 00:57:25,325
we can totally babysit
together if you're nervous.

1281
00:57:25,409 --> 00:57:27,160
Have you seen how hot Thys is?

1282
00:57:27,244 --> 00:57:29,078
I'm like Smuckers 'cause
I'm like jelly.

1283
00:57:29,163 --> 00:57:31,456
You seriously had no
idea he was gonna ask?

1284
00:57:31,540 --> 00:57:32,290
No idea.

1285
00:57:32,374 --> 00:57:33,833
I would have seen it a mile away.

1286
00:57:33,918 --> 00:57:37,337
Credit card receipts, ATM
withdrawals, bank statements,

1287
00:57:37,421 --> 00:57:39,756
rock that big has got a
paper trail mile long.

1288
00:57:39,840 --> 00:57:41,883
Easy to find if you know
what you're looking for.

1289
00:57:41,967 --> 00:57:43,009
Can I see your ring?

1290
00:57:43,969 --> 00:57:46,930
- It is so pretty.
- I know, right?

1291
00:57:47,014 --> 00:57:48,890
- Is it real?
- I hope so.

1292
00:57:48,974 --> 00:57:52,185
I do hope your heart's not
set on the riches of the world.

1293
00:57:52,269 --> 00:57:55,813
Was it hard to say yes with
all those hot Hawaiian dancers

1294
00:57:55,898 --> 00:57:56,856
all around you?

1295
00:57:56,941 --> 00:57:59,567
Not for that reason, just
'cause I was so nervous.

1296
00:57:59,652 --> 00:58:00,735
How much can he bench press?

1297
00:58:00,819 --> 00:58:02,236
How's school going, Bree?

1298
00:58:02,321 --> 00:58:04,197
Well I get to swim with dolphins

1299
00:58:04,281 --> 00:58:06,074
and I get school credit for it.

1300
00:58:06,158 --> 00:58:07,617
So it's pretty awesome.

1301
00:58:07,701 --> 00:58:09,827
But honestly I love the
academic work too.

1302
00:58:09,912 --> 00:58:11,329
Have you studied narwhals yet?

1303
00:58:11,413 --> 00:58:13,039
Not yet, but I'm excited too.

1304
00:58:13,123 --> 00:58:15,208
Buckle up, they're so awesome.

1305
00:58:15,292 --> 00:58:17,168
Wait, so what happens
with your mission then?

1306
00:58:17,252 --> 00:58:18,586
Can Thys come with you?

1307
00:58:18,671 --> 00:58:20,505
I wish, no.

1308
00:58:20,589 --> 00:58:23,508
Well technically he could,
but when they're like 70.

1309
00:58:23,592 --> 00:58:25,843
Actually I won't be able
to go on my mission anymore.

1310
00:58:25,928 --> 00:58:27,095
My call doesn't come for a couple

1311
00:58:27,179 --> 00:58:29,305
of months and when it does,
I'll just have

1312
00:58:29,390 --> 00:58:31,849
to tell them that I'm not able to go.

1313
00:58:33,227 --> 00:58:34,477
But that's okay, you know?

1314
00:58:34,561 --> 00:58:36,562
'Cause I have a new mission, marriage.

1315
00:58:36,647 --> 00:58:38,147
- Yeah.
- Great.

1316
00:58:38,232 --> 00:58:39,148
The most important
mission of your life.

1317
00:58:39,233 --> 00:58:40,942
- Yeah.
- Really is so good.

1318
00:58:43,404 --> 00:58:46,239
Oh, it's my mom.

1319
00:58:51,870 --> 00:58:54,372
You guys, I have a question.

1320
00:58:54,456 --> 00:58:56,332
I just wanted to ask each

1321
00:58:56,417 --> 00:59:01,129
of you if you guys would
be my Bree's maids?

1322
00:59:07,886 --> 00:59:11,222
Okay, I can cross off
pick bridesmaids.

1323
00:59:14,518 --> 00:59:16,019
Wow, I blew it.

1324
00:59:16,103 --> 00:59:16,936
What do you mean?

1325
00:59:17,021 --> 00:59:18,146
We were at that restaurant for

1326
00:59:18,230 --> 00:59:22,066
over two hours and I only
cross off one thing on my list.

1327
00:59:22,151 --> 00:59:25,028
That's okay, we were
catching up and having fun.

1328
00:59:25,112 --> 00:59:28,197
I'm not supposed to be having
fun, I'm planning a wedding.

1329
00:59:29,533 --> 00:59:31,659
Well just try not to be so stressed.

1330
00:59:31,744 --> 00:59:34,787
I'm not stressed, I just..

1331
00:59:38,751 --> 00:59:40,293
Wanna hold Roxy for a bit?

1332
00:59:40,377 --> 00:59:41,169
I'm fine.

1333
00:59:42,921 --> 00:59:44,839
See, perfect.

1334
00:59:46,925 --> 00:59:48,134
Oh look, we're here.

1335
00:59:49,636 --> 00:59:52,055
Thank you guys so much for lunch.

1336
00:59:52,139 --> 00:59:53,973
You really are both the sweetest.

1337
00:59:58,145 --> 00:59:58,978
Bye.

1338
01:00:00,397 --> 01:00:02,356
You think she's okay?

1339
01:00:02,441 --> 01:00:05,651
She's a Carrington, she
kinda has to be.

1340
01:00:12,785 --> 01:00:14,827
Oh this looks amazing.

1341
01:00:14,912 --> 01:00:17,121
Hi ladies.

1342
01:00:17,206 --> 01:00:17,997
What are we working on?

1343
01:00:18,082 --> 01:00:18,873
Just bugging away.

1344
01:00:18,957 --> 01:00:22,376
Well it's the reception
line logistics.

1345
01:00:22,461 --> 01:00:23,920
We're trying to find the right flow.

1346
01:00:24,004 --> 01:00:27,507
Here, this is a diagram
of the cultural hall.

1347
01:00:27,591 --> 01:00:29,050
But my reception's at
the country club?

1348
01:00:29,134 --> 01:00:30,802
Well mama said it was
too much moolah.

1349
01:00:30,886 --> 01:00:32,178
Well I just wanted to
have a backup plan

1350
01:00:32,262 --> 01:00:33,596
just in case there are any problems.

1351
01:00:33,680 --> 01:00:35,056
What sort of problems with there be?

1352
01:00:35,140 --> 01:00:37,308
I mean, dad booked it already, right?

1353
01:00:37,392 --> 01:00:39,477
Well just in case we
change our minds.

1354
01:00:39,561 --> 01:00:40,603
I'm not changing my mind.

1355
01:00:40,687 --> 01:00:42,855
You know we have a plan
for the country club too.

1356
01:00:42,940 --> 01:00:45,108
Just want to cover all our base.

1357
01:00:45,192 --> 01:00:46,150
Looks great.

1358
01:00:47,402 --> 01:00:49,112
I feel like reception lines

1359
01:00:49,196 --> 01:00:52,657
are a little superficial,
even archaic.

1360
01:00:52,741 --> 01:00:53,658
I just think it'd be nice

1361
01:00:53,742 --> 01:00:56,828
if Thys and I could mingle
organically with our guests

1362
01:00:56,912 --> 01:01:00,039
and not spend the whole
night talking to, you know,

1363
01:01:00,124 --> 01:01:02,250
someone's grandpa that
we don't even care about.

1364
01:01:02,334 --> 01:01:03,960
No reception line?

1365
01:01:04,044 --> 01:01:04,961
What are we, cave people?

1366
01:01:05,045 --> 01:01:05,795
You know, let's just put a pin

1367
01:01:05,879 --> 01:01:08,881
in it and your mom asked me
to help you with your dress.

1368
01:01:08,966 --> 01:01:11,592
And so I called a couple
of local boutiques.

1369
01:01:11,677 --> 01:01:16,264
Or you could wear my
old dress, ta-da.

1370
01:01:16,348 --> 01:01:19,225
It's you know, it's got
that retro, vintagey vibe.

1371
01:01:19,309 --> 01:01:21,561
Mom, I'm sure that you
looked beautiful

1372
01:01:21,645 --> 01:01:25,648
when you wore this, but I just
really don't wanna look like

1373
01:01:25,732 --> 01:01:27,358
a polygamous hipster.

1374
01:01:28,318 --> 01:01:30,027
What are you talking about?

1375
01:01:30,112 --> 01:01:31,571
She's got a point.

1376
01:01:31,655 --> 01:01:34,198
I mean I'd know because
my niece is one of them.

1377
01:01:35,576 --> 01:01:37,743
A hipster, not a polygamist.

1378
01:01:37,828 --> 01:01:38,786
Well we could alter it.

1379
01:01:38,871 --> 01:01:41,831
I mean the fabric has
really held its quality.

1380
01:01:41,915 --> 01:01:44,500
Mom no, this is my wedding
dress that we're talking about.

1381
01:01:44,585 --> 01:01:47,003
Okay, why are you being
so cheap all of a sudden?

1382
01:01:50,591 --> 01:01:53,050
Thank you so much for
your help today, ladies.

1383
01:01:53,135 --> 01:01:55,303
We really appreciate it,
but if you'll excuse us,

1384
01:01:55,387 --> 01:01:57,847
my daughter and I need
to go to a safe place

1385
01:01:57,931 --> 01:01:59,473
and work some things out.

1386
01:02:06,773 --> 01:02:09,066
I'm sorry that I called you cheap,

1387
01:02:09,151 --> 01:02:11,110
I know it's your trigger word.

1388
01:02:11,195 --> 01:02:14,780
Frugal is just such a
superior word on so many levels.

1389
01:02:14,865 --> 01:02:16,365
I know, I didn't mean it.

1390
01:02:18,202 --> 01:02:20,036
So are we like poor now?

1391
01:02:20,120 --> 01:02:22,955
No, we're just in conservation mode.

1392
01:02:23,040 --> 01:02:24,790
Why didn't you guys tell me?

1393
01:02:24,875 --> 01:02:25,625
I don't know.

1394
01:02:25,709 --> 01:02:27,418
I mean, we didn't keep it from you.

1395
01:02:27,502 --> 01:02:28,586
You were just away at college

1396
01:02:28,670 --> 01:02:31,464
and we really thought that your
dad would have a job by now.

1397
01:02:31,548 --> 01:02:34,717
Poor dad, ah and I was such a brat.

1398
01:02:36,553 --> 01:02:39,055
But I was really excited
for that country club.

1399
01:02:39,139 --> 01:02:41,891
I know and we can still
have it there.

1400
01:02:41,975 --> 01:02:44,060
We have some savings that
we can dip into.

1401
01:02:44,144 --> 01:02:44,977
It'll be a stretch,

1402
01:02:45,062 --> 01:02:47,063
but I can see that this
is really important

1403
01:02:47,147 --> 01:02:49,315
to you and I don’t want you to
think that we're not willing

1404
01:02:49,399 --> 01:02:50,566
to make sacrifices.

1405
01:02:50,651 --> 01:02:52,652
Well, I can make sacrifices too.

1406
01:02:53,737 --> 01:02:56,280
But the cultural home?

1407
01:02:56,365 --> 01:02:57,406
Listen, I get it,

1408
01:02:57,491 --> 01:02:59,825
it's a vaudeville stage
with a basketball court,

1409
01:02:59,910 --> 01:03:02,078
there's nothing cultural about it.

1410
01:03:02,955 --> 01:03:04,830
Let's just stick to the original plan.

1411
01:03:06,208 --> 01:03:10,753
Okay, hypothetically if
we were to go with plan B,

1412
01:03:11,755 --> 01:03:14,215
do you think you could make
it feel really special?

1413
01:03:14,299 --> 01:03:16,217
Oh please, with all the
money we'd save,

1414
01:03:16,301 --> 01:03:18,469
I'd make it Buckingham
palace in there.

1415
01:03:22,516 --> 01:03:24,684
Okay, I trust you.

1416
01:03:24,768 --> 01:03:25,518
Let’s do it.

1417
01:03:25,602 --> 01:03:27,103
Are you sure?

1418
01:03:27,187 --> 01:03:28,354
- Yes, yeah.
- Oh.

1419
01:03:30,857 --> 01:03:34,235
But since we're gonna be
saving all that money on a venue,

1420
01:03:34,319 --> 01:03:37,405
do you think I could have my
own wedding dress, a new one?

1421
01:03:37,489 --> 01:03:38,781
Of course.

1422
01:03:40,450 --> 01:03:43,327
I wish Paige was here
to help me pick it out.

1423
01:03:43,412 --> 01:03:44,745
I could really use a maid of honor.

1424
01:03:44,830 --> 01:03:46,497
Has there ever been like a mother

1425
01:03:46,581 --> 01:03:48,416
of the bride that's also
been the matron of honor?

1426
01:03:48,500 --> 01:03:50,876
I mean, that could be
pretty cool, couldn't it?

1427
01:03:50,961 --> 01:03:52,336
Nice try mom.

1428
01:03:52,421 --> 01:03:53,462
It's worth a shot.

1429
01:03:55,090 --> 01:03:57,842
All right, you ready to do this?

1430
01:03:57,926 --> 01:03:59,927
Yeah, let's get you stirred up.

1431
01:04:00,012 --> 01:04:01,220
Nope, we don't do that.

1432
01:04:01,305 --> 01:04:02,638
We just say registered.

1433
01:04:02,723 --> 01:04:04,557
That’s what we say when
we go inside, okay?

1434
01:04:04,641 --> 01:04:05,474
Okay, all right.

1435
01:04:05,559 --> 01:04:07,893
So whatever we scan
shows up on our registry?

1436
01:04:07,978 --> 01:04:09,770
- Yup.
- Rock and roll.

1437
01:04:29,833 --> 01:04:31,751
♪ I start to talk and you
already know ♪

1438
01:04:31,835 --> 01:04:33,044
Oh mattress pads,

1439
01:04:33,128 --> 01:04:35,004
- you gotta have those.
- Oh and I need these.

1440
01:04:35,088 --> 01:04:38,174
- Oh and mom, these.
- Naper, yes, I love him.

1441
01:04:38,258 --> 01:04:42,386
You can never have to
may throw pillows.

1442
01:04:42,471 --> 01:04:45,181
Mom, candles, Emerald Amazon.

1443
01:04:45,265 --> 01:04:47,516
- White spruce.
- Citrus water.

1444
01:04:47,601 --> 01:04:48,642
Snuggly sweater.

1445
01:04:51,313 --> 01:04:53,272
lsland moonlight.

1446
01:04:54,149 --> 01:04:56,942
Good lighting is so important.

1447
01:04:57,027 --> 01:04:58,569
Oh look at these frames.

1448
01:04:58,653 --> 01:05:01,489
Mom, I have so many cute
pictures from Hawaii.

1449
01:05:05,077 --> 01:05:05,993
Planners!

1450
01:05:10,040 --> 01:05:12,958
Vases and a really cute toaster

1451
01:05:13,043 --> 01:05:14,293
over and a charcuterie board...

1452
01:05:14,378 --> 01:05:16,545
And you really didn't
get anything for me?

1453
01:05:16,630 --> 01:05:19,215
Camping stuff, a Frisbee,
some beef jerky?

1454
01:05:19,299 --> 01:05:20,257
Well if you cared so much,

1455
01:05:20,342 --> 01:05:22,343
you could have been there, mister.

1456
01:05:22,427 --> 01:05:23,344
Ouch.

1457
01:05:23,428 --> 01:05:25,554
Was that supposed to be
your "E.T." impression?

1458
01:05:25,639 --> 01:05:26,764
Oh no, that'd be awful.

1459
01:05:26,848 --> 01:05:28,307
No that'd be more like,

1460
01:05:29,726 --> 01:05:30,559
- oh.
- Oh.

1461
01:05:31,978 --> 01:05:33,646
Yours is so much better.

1462
01:05:35,148 --> 01:05:35,940
I miss you.

1463
01:05:36,024 --> 01:05:37,441
We FaceTime like every three hours.

1464
01:05:37,526 --> 01:05:39,652
I know but this is not the same.

1465
01:05:39,736 --> 01:05:42,613
I know, I miss you and
your cute face.

1466
01:05:42,697 --> 01:05:43,864
And you sure you’re okay

1467
01:05:43,949 --> 01:05:45,866
that we changed the reception venue?

1468
01:05:45,951 --> 01:05:46,700
You know my parents would have paid

1469
01:05:46,785 --> 01:05:48,202
for the country club, right?

1470
01:05:48,286 --> 01:05:49,036
I know they would have,

1471
01:05:49,121 --> 01:05:51,205
but it's the bride's responsibility

1472
01:05:51,289 --> 01:05:53,416
and you know how
traditional my parents are.

1473
01:05:53,500 --> 01:05:55,960
Yeah, but Bree, our
guests have to come too.

1474
01:05:56,044 --> 01:05:57,420
What do you mean?

1475
01:05:57,504 --> 01:05:58,379
I mean, it's fine.

1476
01:05:58,463 --> 01:06:02,091
Like if my parents have the
rehearsal dinner, it's all good.

1477
01:06:02,175 --> 01:06:03,050
It's whatever you want.

1478
01:06:03,135 --> 01:06:04,593
I promise it's gonna be awesome.

1479
01:06:04,678 --> 01:06:06,762
It's a weird that I
don't care at all?

1480
01:06:06,847 --> 01:06:08,472
'Cause only care about marrying you.

1481
01:06:08,557 --> 01:06:09,390
Are you sure?

1482
01:06:09,474 --> 01:06:12,059
Because our invites go
to the printer tomorrow.

1483
01:06:12,144 --> 01:06:15,104
Print away, do your wifely duties.

1484
01:06:15,188 --> 01:06:16,230
Okay, well I have to go

1485
01:06:16,314 --> 01:06:17,690
to bed because I need some sleep,
but...

1486
01:06:17,774 --> 01:06:19,316
You sure, for real this time?

1487
01:06:19,401 --> 01:06:22,278
For real, I'm hanging up.

1488
01:06:22,362 --> 01:06:23,195
But I love you.

1489
01:06:23,280 --> 01:06:24,029
I love you too.

1490
01:06:24,114 --> 01:06:25,698
- I love you so much.
- I miss you forever.

1491
01:06:25,782 --> 01:06:27,741
Oh, it already hurts.

1492
01:06:27,826 --> 01:06:32,788
Thys Abner, honey, haven't
written to her yet, seriously?

1493
01:06:37,794 --> 01:06:38,919
Take care of this honey.

1494
01:06:39,004 --> 01:06:39,795
I will.

1495
01:06:46,303 --> 01:06:48,596
Okay, Sister Brodhead was
up all night addressing these.

1496
01:06:48,680 --> 01:06:49,930
So please be careful.

1497
01:06:50,015 --> 01:06:52,683
Oh, this definitely makes it real.

1498
01:06:52,767 --> 01:06:54,351
Last chance to push
the eject button.

1499
01:06:54,436 --> 01:06:55,352
What's the big deal?

1500
01:06:55,437 --> 01:06:56,562
It's only for eternity.

1501
01:06:56,646 --> 01:06:58,772
All right, peasants, do your job.

1502
01:06:58,857 --> 01:07:01,901
We have some serious
business to attend to.

1503
01:07:01,985 --> 01:07:03,110
See ya, suckers.

1504
01:07:03,195 --> 01:07:04,111
You hear that, boys?

1505
01:07:04,196 --> 01:07:04,987
Hop too.

1506
01:07:06,490 --> 01:07:08,616
Oh honey, you use the
moistener, that's what it's for.

1507
01:07:08,700 --> 01:07:10,326
No way, love the taste.

1508
01:07:12,454 --> 01:07:15,039
- It fits perfectly.
- Right?

1509
01:07:15,123 --> 01:07:16,540
In some parts.

1510
01:07:16,625 --> 01:07:19,293
Holy Meghan Markle, I
think this is it.

1511
01:07:19,377 --> 01:07:20,711
When you smile, don't use so much gum.

1512
01:07:20,795 --> 01:07:22,046
You know how you can get.

1513
01:07:22,130 --> 01:07:24,548
All that lace, you know
you're gonna snag.

1514
01:07:24,633 --> 01:07:26,926
If you don't like my opinion,
then I don't have to give it.

1515
01:07:27,844 --> 01:07:31,096
I don't wanna wear any, I'm
not gonna go to the wedding.

1516
01:07:32,307 --> 01:07:33,933
I think I found it.

1517
01:07:34,017 --> 01:07:36,602
♪ I promise I'll keep it ♪

1518
01:07:36,686 --> 01:07:37,895
Wow, it's perfect.

You look so pretty.

1520

Think we got a winner.

1522
01:07:42,609 --> 01:07:43,859
- Oh boy.
- What's the problem?

1523
01:07:43,944 --> 01:07:46,070
Is it too expensive, is
dad gonna freak?

1524
01:07:46,154 --> 01:07:48,781
Yes, but I have ways of
convincing your father.

1525
01:07:48,865 --> 01:07:52,076
I have an old bottle of CK One
fragrance in my top drawer.

1526
01:07:52,160 --> 01:07:53,911
Okay, mom, I don't
need to know the details.

1527
01:07:53,995 --> 01:07:55,746
Just do what you need to do.

1528
01:07:55,830 --> 01:07:56,997
Ring us up, Lucas.

1529
01:08:00,961 --> 01:08:01,752
Oh my, wow.

1530
01:08:04,089 --> 01:08:06,131
How did they know we were here?

1531
01:08:14,683 --> 01:08:16,267
Let's give her some room.

01:08:16,351 --> 01:08:18,060
Home stretch, guys, almost there.

1533
01:08:19,104 --> 01:08:20,187
Mitt Romney.

1534
01:08:20,272 --> 01:08:21,814
No way.

1535
01:08:21,898 --> 01:08:23,357
Oh, you think that's cool?

1536
01:08:23,441 --> 01:08:24,900
Heard Steve Martin might show up.

1537
01:08:24,985 --> 01:08:25,985
Who's Steve Martin.

1538
01:08:27,445 --> 01:08:28,237
You're not my son.

1539
01:08:28,321 --> 01:08:30,155
All girls, show me, Hannah.

1540
01:08:31,074 --> 01:08:32,616
You were right, I love it.

1541

I love it, Mindy, Charlotte.

1542
01:08:35,620 --> 01:08:37,121
The zipper goes in the back.

1543
01:08:37,205 --> 01:08:39,123
- It's a choice.
- Flip it, Mindy.

1544
01:08:39,207 --> 01:08:41,417
Anderson sisters, how we doing?

1545
01:08:41,501 --> 01:08:42,960
- It's so tight, Bree.
- Well you're not supposed

1546
01:08:43,044 --> 01:08:45,921
to wear clothes underneath
it, Mykelle, Phoebe?

1547
01:08:47,090 --> 01:08:50,009
Oh, you're adorable, Lane?

1548

Oh, that's lane.

1555
01:09:10,739 --> 01:09:12,197
She's given me a ride to
the post office.

1556
01:09:12,282 --> 01:09:13,115
Oh, tell her to step

1557
01:09:13,199 --> 01:09:15,492
on it because the last
pick up is in 23 minute.

1558

To the reception.

1561
01:09:26,296 --> 01:09:27,963
We only invited extended family

1562
01:09:28,048 --> 01:09:29,798
to the actual temple ceremony.

1563
01:09:29,883 --> 01:09:31,216
Your temples are gorgeous.

1564
01:09:31,301 --> 01:09:33,802
It must cost so much money
to get married there.

1565
01:09:33,887 --> 01:09:36,847
Actually it doesn’t cost a thing.

1566
01:09:36,931 --> 01:09:38,223
Serious?

1567
01:09:38,308 --> 01:09:39,558
Not a dime.

1568
01:09:39,643 --> 01:09:41,226
Okay, well to be fair,

1569
01:09:41,311 --> 01:09:44,313
you do pay 10% of your annual
income for your entire life

1570
01:09:44,397 --> 01:09:45,147
to the church.

1571
01:09:45,231 --> 01:09:47,441
So it's not free per se,

1572
01:09:47,525 --> 01:09:49,902
but you can think of it
more like a membership perk

1573
01:09:49,986 --> 01:09:52,029
than an upfront cost.

1574
01:09:52,113 --> 01:09:55,658
Okay, right there
to the left, perfect.

1575
01:09:58,828 --> 01:10:00,913
Can I ask you guys
something in confidence?

1576
01:10:00,997 --> 01:10:01,747
- Sure.
- Yeah.

1577
01:10:01,831 --> 01:10:03,582
Is it weird that Thys is inviting

1578
01:10:03,667 --> 01:10:05,084
his ex-girlfriend's family

1579
01:10:05,168 --> 01:10:07,711
to the wedding or am I
just being super paranoid?

1580
01:10:07,796 --> 01:10:10,714
Well, that doesn't
sound super normal.

1581
01:10:10,799 --> 01:10:13,092
But didn't you say they're
his close family friends?

1582
01:10:13,176 --> 01:10:15,052
Yeah of like 30 years.

1583
01:10:15,136 --> 01:10:18,347
Okay, then maybe it's
not super weird either.

1584
01:10:18,431 --> 01:10:21,475
Did he at least ask you
before you invited them?

1585
01:10:21,559 --> 01:10:24,395
No, they were just on
the Chesterfield list.

1586
01:10:25,355 --> 01:10:27,690
Well I mean he definitely
should have asked you

1587
01:10:27,774 --> 01:10:30,442
just to make sure you
were okay with it.

1588
01:10:30,527 --> 01:10:33,028
But maybe his parents did
it without even thinking.

1589
01:10:34,072 --> 01:10:35,656
I don't know, if you're uncomfortable

1590
01:10:35,740 --> 01:10:38,659
with it, you should probably
have a conversation.

1591
01:10:38,743 --> 01:10:39,827
You're right.

1592
01:10:39,911 --> 01:10:40,661
I'm just gonna talk to him

1593
01:10:40,745 --> 01:10:42,413
about it before I said there's out,
yeah?

1594
01:10:42,497 --> 01:10:43,956
- Yeah.
- I'll put it in my purse.

1595
01:10:44,874 --> 01:10:46,125
Okay, let's go.

1596
01:10:56,177 --> 01:10:58,929
♪ I found what I need ♪

1597
01:10:59,013 --> 01:11:01,473
♪ Like honey to a bee ♪

1598
01:11:01,558 --> 01:11:06,520
♪ And I'm buzzing 'cause
it feels so sweet ♪

1599
01:11:07,689 --> 01:11:10,315
♪ And I've got you by the hand ♪

1600
01:11:10,400 --> 01:11:13,277
♪ And I'll never give it back ♪

1601
01:11:13,361 --> 01:11:18,282
♪ 'Cause together, you
and me are made to last ♪

1602
01:11:18,366 --> 01:11:20,200
You guys, I think
I'm getting cold feet.

1603
01:11:20,285 --> 01:11:21,744
Okay, you have one minute

1604
01:11:21,828 --> 01:11:24,371
to pull out as many of
these rings as you can.

1605
01:11:24,456 --> 01:11:26,874
Good luck with
those sausages.

1606
01:11:26,958 --> 01:11:28,375
Now go.

1607
01:11:29,502 --> 01:11:30,627
You got one!

1608
01:11:34,549 --> 01:11:37,426
So now we're going be
asking Bree trivia questions

1609
01:11:37,510 --> 01:11:39,011
about her beloved fiance.

1610
01:11:40,180 --> 01:11:41,305
If she gets one right,

1611
01:11:41,389 --> 01:11:44,057
then we have to stuff a
marshmallow in our cheeks.

1612
01:11:44,142 --> 01:11:47,436
But if she gets it wrong, then
she has to stuff it in hers.

1613
01:11:47,520 --> 01:11:49,271
All right, stretch those
cheeks ladies,

1614
01:11:49,355 --> 01:11:51,690
'cause this is going to
be easy Breezy.

1615
01:11:51,775 --> 01:11:53,525
Enunciate, we can't hear you.

1616
01:11:56,070 --> 01:11:58,071
Did you say "Napoleon Dynamite"?

1617
01:11:59,032 --> 01:12:02,326
I'm so sorry, it was "Princess Bride".

1618
01:12:02,410 --> 01:12:04,745
No fair, I've never even seen it.

1619
01:12:04,829 --> 01:12:05,829
What?

1620
01:12:05,914 --> 01:12:07,456
Who are you?

1621
01:12:07,540 --> 01:12:09,500
Thank you, Sister Robinson.

1622
01:12:12,045 --> 01:12:14,713
And now I have the whole trilogy.

1623
01:12:17,300 --> 01:12:20,385
Well, as long as we're
on the subject.

1624
01:12:20,470 --> 01:12:21,428
Thank you, Nedra.

1625
01:12:21,513 --> 01:12:24,139
You are always so
thoughtful with your gifts.

1626
01:12:24,224 --> 01:12:28,185
Don't thank me now, thank me later.

1627
01:12:30,772 --> 01:12:33,857
Oh, Bree, would
you mind getting the door?

1628
01:12:36,027 --> 01:12:37,694
- Thys!
- Aloha, stranger.

1629
01:12:48,456 --> 01:12:50,082
Just warms my heart.

1630
01:12:50,166 --> 01:12:50,999
You get anything good?

1631
01:12:51,084 --> 01:12:52,459
Yeah, got lots of good stuff.

1632
01:12:52,544 --> 01:12:54,086
Nice, show me what you got.

1633
01:12:55,171 --> 01:12:57,673
I will on our wedding night.

1634
01:12:58,842 --> 01:12:59,675
Right, good.

1635
01:13:00,760 --> 01:13:03,095
- So good to see you.
- You too.

1636
01:13:03,179 --> 01:13:04,680
- Wanna get outta here?
- Yeah.

1637
01:13:04,764 --> 01:13:05,556
Okay.

1638
01:13:07,141 --> 01:13:09,309
Wanna see what we've been up too?

1639
01:13:09,394 --> 01:13:12,062
Now I know the basketball
hoops are hideous,

1640
01:13:12,146 --> 01:13:15,148
but don’t worry, Curt and
the boys are gonna go early

1641
01:13:15,233 --> 01:13:17,776
and take them down.

1642
01:13:17,861 --> 01:13:20,362
Now I didn't have time to
make everything exactly

1643
01:13:20,446 --> 01:13:22,698
to scale, but I think
this paints the picture

1644
01:13:22,782 --> 01:13:23,866
thematically and otherwise

1645
01:13:23,950 --> 01:13:26,326
and you might've noticed
that there is no caterer

1646
01:13:26,411 --> 01:13:27,661
on the vendor list, but don't worry,

1647
01:13:27,745 --> 01:13:29,204
we have something better.

1648
01:13:29,289 --> 01:13:32,875
It's called Costco and the
Relief Society.

1649
01:13:32,959 --> 01:13:34,877
It's beautiful, mom.

1650
01:13:34,961 --> 01:13:38,380
Oh, did you guys happen to
have any extra invitations?

1651
01:13:38,464 --> 01:13:40,674
Yes but if you're going
to add to the guest list,

1652
01:13:40,758 --> 01:13:41,925
I'm gonna need to know ASAP

1653
01:13:42,010 --> 01:13:43,343
'cause I have to make
some arrangements.

1654
01:13:43,428 --> 01:13:45,804
It's not extra, my parents' friends

1655
01:13:45,889 --> 01:13:47,014
didn't get theirs somehow.

1656
01:13:47,098 --> 01:13:50,058
It's the Lees.

1657
01:13:50,143 --> 01:13:51,643
Maybe it got lost in the mail.

1658
01:13:51,728 --> 01:13:52,603
Yeah, that's fine.

1659
01:13:52,687 --> 01:13:54,563
- I'll just snag an extra one.
- The Lees.

1660
01:13:54,647 --> 01:13:58,609
Now why does that name
sounds so familiar?

1661
01:13:58,693 --> 01:14:00,736
It's my ex-girlfriend's family.

1662
01:14:01,696 --> 01:14:04,364
My mom said she talked
to you about them though.

1663
01:14:04,449 --> 01:14:05,532
I kind of was under the impression

1664
01:14:05,617 --> 01:14:06,575
that they'd be out of town.

1665
01:14:06,659 --> 01:14:08,327
They are, yeah, I think they
were gonna pick up Bridget

1666
01:14:08,411 --> 01:14:10,662
from Barcelona, but I
think they must've just

1667
01:14:10,747 --> 01:14:11,705
canceled their trip.

1668
01:14:13,416 --> 01:14:14,583
Why do you say like that,

1669
01:14:14,667 --> 01:14:17,127
With that weird little lisp thing?

1670
01:14:18,087 --> 01:14:18,962
Barcelona?

1671
01:14:20,256 --> 01:14:21,965
It's just how you say it in Spain.

1672
01:14:22,884 --> 01:14:24,134
Oh, we’re not in Spain.

1673
01:14:25,136 --> 01:14:28,013
Yeah, that's just how
Bridget taught me to say it.

1674
01:14:28,097 --> 01:14:30,766
Anyway, Miss Carrington,
you don't have to worry.

1675
01:14:30,850 --> 01:14:31,600
I totally get it,

1676
01:14:31,684 --> 01:14:35,145
but I sent her a Dear Jane,
pretty clear Dear Jane letter.

1677
01:14:36,105 --> 01:14:37,147
They're just close family friends,

1678
01:14:37,231 --> 01:14:39,983
so we thought it would be
weird if they weren't invited.

1679
01:14:41,819 --> 01:14:42,861
That's okay, right?

1680
01:14:42,946 --> 01:14:43,737
I don't want...

1681
01:14:46,282 --> 01:14:48,742
Sure, yeah, sure.

1682
01:14:48,826 --> 01:14:50,786
Okay, this is great by the way.

1683
01:14:50,870 --> 01:14:52,746
I love the whole spread.

1684
01:14:52,830 --> 01:14:56,083
It's just like, yeah.

1685
01:14:56,167 --> 01:14:57,417
I have a surprise for you.

1686
01:14:59,003 --> 01:15:00,796
- Great.
- Sound good?

1687
01:15:04,133 --> 01:15:07,928
♪ I don't believe I met yet ♪

1688
01:15:08,012 --> 01:15:10,597
♪ A light to break my light ♪

1689
01:15:10,682 --> 01:15:12,474
Are you ready for your surprise?

1690
01:15:12,558 --> 01:15:14,393
I thought this fancy
dinner was a surprise.

1691
01:15:14,477 --> 01:15:15,936
Oh no, it's way better.

1692
01:15:16,020 --> 01:15:16,979
Are you ready?

1693
01:15:17,063 --> 01:15:18,438
No.

1694
01:15:18,523 --> 01:15:21,358
I need to get something
off my chest first.

1695
01:15:21,442 --> 01:15:22,943
Okay yeah, what's up, what's wrong?

1696
01:15:23,027 --> 01:15:24,987
Promise you'll forgive me?

1697
01:15:25,071 --> 01:15:26,947
It kind of depends on what you say.

1698
01:15:27,031 --> 01:15:27,864
I lied to you.

1699
01:15:28,908 --> 01:15:31,743
The Lees invitation didn't get lost

1700
01:15:31,828 --> 01:15:33,745
in the mail, I just never sent it.

1701
01:15:34,914 --> 01:15:35,747
Why?

1702
01:15:36,874 --> 01:15:41,378
I meant to talk to you about
it and I just got so busy

1703
01:15:41,462 --> 01:15:45,966
and then I was just so excited
to see you and I forgot.

1704
01:15:46,050 --> 01:15:48,593
That's fine, that's fine, but like

1705
01:15:48,678 --> 01:15:50,971
why did you feel like
we had to talk about it?

1706
01:15:52,223 --> 01:15:53,724
I don’t know, I guess...

1707
01:15:54,976 --> 01:15:56,351
I guess I felt threatened.

1708
01:15:57,478 --> 01:16:00,522
I know the history that
you have with them and

1709
01:16:00,606 --> 01:16:04,026
with Bridget and Thys, your
parents basically have a shrine

1710
01:16:04,110 --> 01:16:05,527
dedicated to her in their bathroom.

1711
01:16:05,611 --> 01:16:06,945
Yeah but like, we're not a thing.

1712
01:16:07,030 --> 01:16:08,113
We're not, you don't have
to be worried.

1713
01:16:08,197 --> 01:16:12,200
I know, but she gets back
so soon and I just, I just...

1714
01:16:12,285 --> 01:16:13,618
I didn't want either of us thinking

1715
01:16:13,703 --> 01:16:14,953
about her on our wedding day.

1716
01:16:15,038 --> 01:16:17,330
Honestly, they're probably
not even gonna show up.

1717
01:16:17,415 --> 01:16:18,790
I kind of hope not.

1718
01:16:18,875 --> 01:16:22,627
Yeah but if they do, like
I can't control that, right?

1719
01:16:22,712 --> 01:16:24,504
Okay Bree, at some point
you're gonna have

1720
01:16:24,589 --> 01:16:26,465
to start trusting me, okay?

1721
01:16:26,549 --> 01:16:27,340
I do trust you.

1722
01:16:27,425 --> 01:16:29,384
It's just, I don't know.

1723
01:16:29,469 --> 01:16:32,220
You haven't been around and
it's been really stressful.

1724
01:16:32,305 --> 01:16:34,264
Yeah, totally, I just...

1725
01:16:34,348 --> 01:16:36,433
I'm here now though, all right?

1726
01:16:36,517 --> 01:16:37,350
Everything's fine.

1727
01:16:38,227 --> 01:16:39,686
- Promise?
- Promise.

1728
01:16:39,771 --> 01:16:40,520
And you forgive me?

1729
01:16:40,605 --> 01:16:42,064
Oh, forgiven and forgotten,
you're good.

1730
01:16:42,148 --> 01:16:45,525
Okay, now I’m ready for my surprise.

1731
01:16:45,610 --> 01:16:47,027
Okay, here is a hint.

1732
01:16:49,363 --> 01:16:51,656
Oh, it's my surprise dessert?

1733
01:16:54,577 --> 01:16:57,037
Is this like a scene from
"The Princess Bride" or?

1734
01:16:58,498 --> 01:17:00,540
♪ Ba, baba, ba ♪

1735
01:17:00,625 --> 01:17:04,628
Oh, Blues Clues, is it Blues Clues?

1736
01:17:04,712 --> 01:17:05,921
I don’t know you, no.

1737
01:17:07,840 --> 01:17:10,342
First down, wee-oh, wee-oh.

1738
01:17:11,719 --> 01:17:13,136
I am so lost.

1739
01:17:13,221 --> 01:17:14,304
You really don't know?

1740
01:17:14,388 --> 01:17:15,305
I got nothing.

1741
01:17:16,682 --> 01:17:19,976
I got accepted into the
business school at BYU Provo.

1742
01:17:20,061 --> 01:17:21,228
I start second block.

1743
01:17:22,105 --> 01:17:23,230
But I thought we were going

1744
01:17:23,314 --> 01:17:25,023
to finish Hawaii together first?

1745
01:17:25,108 --> 01:17:25,857
Yeah we were, but that was

1746
01:17:25,942 --> 01:17:27,943
before I got accepted into Real BYU.

1747
01:17:29,487 --> 01:17:30,612
Thank you very much.

1748
01:17:30,696 --> 01:17:31,696
But what about me?

1749
01:17:31,781 --> 01:17:32,989
I didn't get accepted.

1750
01:17:33,074 --> 01:17:34,991
Yeah but you will, eventually.

1751
01:17:35,076 --> 01:17:36,576
And what do I do before then?

1752
01:17:36,661 --> 01:17:39,663
I just forget about my internship

1753
01:17:39,747 --> 01:17:41,873
and drop out of school, go to UVU?

1754
01:17:41,958 --> 01:17:42,874
Maybe.

1755
01:17:42,959 --> 01:17:44,459
Thys, they don't even
offer my major.

1756
01:17:44,544 --> 01:17:46,044
You switch majors, big deal.

1757
01:17:47,296 --> 01:17:48,630
Bree, Marine biology?

1758
01:17:48,714 --> 01:17:50,298
That’s something you say
when you're like five.

1759
01:17:50,383 --> 01:17:51,967
You don't really stick with that.

1760
01:17:56,347 --> 01:17:57,973
Sorry, that was...

1761
01:18:00,309 --> 01:18:01,726
That was mean.

1762
01:18:01,811 --> 01:18:03,186
I didn't mean that.

1763
01:18:06,274 --> 01:18:07,107
I overreacted.

1764
01:18:09,068 --> 01:18:11,111
I just was really pumped

1765
01:18:11,195 --> 01:18:13,655
about this and I thought
you'd be excited for me.

1766
01:18:13,739 --> 01:18:15,365
I didn't even know that you applied.

1767
01:18:15,449 --> 01:18:16,533
That's because I didn't tell anyone.

1768
01:18:16,617 --> 01:18:17,409
I mean my parent knew.

1769
01:18:17,493 --> 01:18:20,036
I don't care Thys, I'm your fiance.

1770
01:18:20,121 --> 01:18:21,538
I need communication.

1771
01:18:21,622 --> 01:18:24,833
This is our life, not
your Instagram story.

1772
01:18:26,711 --> 01:18:29,504
You're right, I'm sorry.

1773
01:18:29,589 --> 01:18:32,465
I just, I felt so much
pressure to provide for the two

1774
01:18:32,550 --> 01:18:35,719
of us and their business school
is one of the top programs.

1775
01:18:38,848 --> 01:18:40,640
I just thought he'd be proud of me.

1776
01:18:40,725 --> 01:18:42,434
I am proud of your Thys,

1777
01:18:42,518 --> 01:18:45,729
but I need you to include me
in these decisions from now on.

1778
01:18:45,813 --> 01:18:47,689
I need to be able to have a say

1779
01:18:47,773 --> 01:18:49,399
in things that affect us both.

1780
01:18:50,276 --> 01:18:53,278
You're right, you're
completely right.

1781
01:18:53,362 --> 01:18:55,405
I'm sorry, will you forgive me?

1782
01:18:57,366 --> 01:19:02,370
Of course, forgiven
and forgotten.

1783
01:19:07,001 --> 01:19:08,877
Don't say anything.

1784
01:19:08,961 --> 01:19:11,129
Just follow my lead, be cool.

1785
01:19:11,214 --> 01:19:12,547
What is happening?

1786
01:19:13,799 --> 01:19:16,092
Stacey, oh that's so
beautiful, is it French?

1787
01:19:16,177 --> 01:19:18,220
No, it's just Stacey, it's American.

1788
01:19:18,304 --> 01:19:19,346
It's very Regal.

1789
01:19:20,264 --> 01:19:23,016
Listen, I have a coupon
from a competitor.

1790
01:19:23,100 --> 01:19:24,100
Will you honor it?

1791
01:19:25,436 --> 01:19:27,062
This is expired two years ago.

1792
01:19:28,147 --> 01:19:30,899
That's not gonna be a
problem though, right?

1793
01:19:30,983 --> 01:19:31,733
No.

1794
01:19:33,611 --> 01:19:34,402
Amy?

1795
01:19:35,279 --> 01:19:37,405
Okay, what are your wedding colors?

1796
01:19:37,490 --> 01:19:39,115
Okay, I'm so glad you asked.

1797
01:19:39,200 --> 01:19:40,951
How much time do you have right now?

1798
01:19:44,038 --> 01:19:45,830
Is that Madagascar vanilla?

1799
01:19:45,915 --> 01:19:47,707
- It is.
- I knew it.

1800
01:19:47,792 --> 01:19:48,875
What flavor is that?

1801
01:19:48,960 --> 01:19:50,335
Oh that’s our cookie dough.

1802
01:19:50,419 --> 01:19:52,379
- The cookie dough.
- Super popular.

1803
01:19:52,463 --> 01:19:54,673
Oh mom, how about the funfetti?

1804
01:19:54,757 --> 01:19:56,508
Not for a wedding,
that's not appropriate.

1805
01:19:56,592 --> 01:19:59,094
It's fun for like fun,
but it's not elegant.

1806
01:19:59,178 --> 01:20:00,762
It's so good though.

1807
01:20:00,846 --> 01:20:02,264
So what would you suggest?

1808
01:20:02,348 --> 01:20:03,723
I really like fantasy creatures.

1809
01:20:03,808 --> 01:20:08,770
Like maybe a nice friendly
dragon or maybe a unicorn,

1810
01:20:08,854 --> 01:20:10,438
a Pegasus or something like that.

1811
01:20:10,523 --> 01:20:13,024
I mean, we were mostly get temples,

1812
01:20:13,109 --> 01:20:18,071
but you imagine like a mermaid
scene, a mermaid and a merman

1813
01:20:18,322 --> 01:20:20,282
and they're, you know,
they're close to each other.

1814
01:20:20,366 --> 01:20:21,408
It could be really nice.

1815
01:20:21,492 --> 01:20:23,952
But how much do you
charge for a custom design?

1816
01:20:24,036 --> 01:20:26,246
No, the prices are in the brochure.

1817
01:20:26,330 --> 01:20:27,831
It's really impressive.

1818
01:20:27,915 --> 01:20:30,000
And a little bit
more than I anticipated.

1819
01:20:30,084 --> 01:20:31,501
Well, there's a lot
that goes into it.

1820
01:20:31,585 --> 01:20:34,587
It's not just an easy thing to do.

1821
01:20:34,672 --> 01:20:36,548
So time and creativity.

1822
01:20:37,717 --> 01:20:39,926
Do you offer correspondence courses?

1823
01:20:40,011 --> 01:20:41,761
Well, Jesse has a YouTube channel.

1824
01:20:43,514 --> 01:20:45,307
How many subscribers does he have?

1825
01:20:48,644 --> 01:20:50,979
It looks like you two
are all squared away.

1826
01:20:51,063 --> 01:20:52,814
Got your temple prep
class you're finishing up

1827
01:20:52,898 --> 01:20:54,899
on Sunday, you've got your recommends

1828
01:20:54,984 --> 01:20:56,192
and you've got the
appointment at the temple

1829
01:20:56,277 --> 01:20:57,402
for the ceiling.

1830
01:20:57,486 --> 01:20:59,654
And knowing Carrie, I
imagine the planning

1831
01:20:59,739 --> 01:21:00,488
is all squared away.

1832
01:21:00,573 --> 01:21:02,073
- Yes.
- Yeah.

1833
01:21:02,158 --> 01:21:04,534
Is there anything else
you guys need?

1834
01:21:04,618 --> 01:21:06,369
I think just any advice that
you have for us, you know,

1835
01:21:06,454 --> 01:21:08,330
- before the big day.
- Yeah, yeah.

1836
01:21:08,414 --> 01:21:10,582
Think I've unloaded
all my wedding wisdom.

1837
01:21:11,667 --> 01:21:14,377
It's really up to you two
at this point.

1838
01:21:14,462 --> 01:21:17,464
It's all about your commitment
to God and to each other.

1839
01:21:18,549 --> 01:21:19,716
Okay.

1840
01:21:19,800 --> 01:21:21,301
Thank you, thank you so much.

1841
01:21:21,385 --> 01:21:22,761
Thank you, Bishop.

1842
01:21:22,845 --> 01:21:24,429
Oh one more thing.

1843
01:21:24,513 --> 01:21:26,097
I did hear rumblings about the girls

1844
01:21:26,182 --> 01:21:28,767
planning a bit of a bachelorette
party for you this weekend

1845
01:21:28,851 --> 01:21:30,769
and I don't know your
pals probably have

1846
01:21:30,853 --> 01:21:32,437
something planned for you too.

1847
01:21:32,521 --> 01:21:35,648
I just, you know, make
sure you take it easy.

1848
01:21:35,733 --> 01:21:37,609

Elwes actually broke his toe

01:24:20,689 --> 01:24:22,315
Just like in "Lord of the Rings."

1906
01:24:24,693 --> 01:24:27,529
Never eating that
much yogurt ever again.

1907
01:24:28,697 --> 01:24:30,657
Thank you for my blanket.

1908
01:24:30,741 --> 01:24:33,910
Of course, I had to
get my girl something.

1909
01:24:36,330 --> 01:24:39,207
And thank you for taking
us to the club.

1910
01:24:40,292 --> 01:24:41,751
I thought you hated it.

1911
01:24:41,835 --> 01:24:46,798
Yeah, I did, but I had
to experience it, you know?

1912
01:24:46,966 --> 01:24:49,384
We lasted less than 10 minutes.

1913
01:24:49,468 --> 01:24:52,387
Okay, but we crushed
every second of it.

1914
01:24:53,389 --> 01:24:54,222
Am I right?

1915
01:24:55,224 --> 01:24:56,307
Especially Hannah.

1916
01:25:00,813 --> 01:25:03,314
I just hope Thys doesn't care.

1917
01:25:04,358 --> 01:25:05,858
Why would he care?

1918
01:25:05,943 --> 01:25:07,944
He might just think
it was just too crazy.

1919
01:25:08,028 --> 01:25:10,822
I mean, who goes to a club
for their bachelorette party?

1920
01:25:12,408 --> 01:25:13,616
Literally everyone.

1921
01:25:16,787 --> 01:25:19,706
Besides I'm sure that his
bachelor party is way crazier.

1922
01:25:20,791 --> 01:25:23,334
He's going to Top
Golf with his brothers.

1923
01:25:25,337 --> 01:25:28,256
Or maybe slightly less crazy.

1924
01:25:30,926 --> 01:25:32,760
I love you, Laney.

1925
01:25:32,845 --> 01:25:35,430
- I love you too.
- Seriously,

1926
01:25:35,514 --> 01:25:38,516
you have always had my
back, like no judgment,

1927
01:25:38,601 --> 01:25:39,559
no matter what.

1928
01:25:40,644 --> 01:25:45,106
Even though Paige is
officially my maid of honor,

1929
01:25:46,108 --> 01:25:51,112
unofficially, you're my maid of honor.

1930
01:25:56,327 --> 01:25:59,704
Thank you for saying that, Bree.

1931
01:25:59,788 --> 01:26:01,456
It really means a lot to me.

1932
01:26:04,209 --> 01:26:09,130
I know I haven't been around
much, but if you ever.

1933
01:26:16,096 --> 01:26:17,055
I love you.

1934
01:26:37,242 --> 01:26:39,202
Thys is here.

1935
01:26:39,286 --> 01:26:40,078
What?

1936
01:26:41,330 --> 01:26:44,040
Babe, we were only at the
club for like five minutes

1937
01:26:44,124 --> 01:26:45,375
and nothing happened, I swear.

1938
01:26:45,459 --> 01:26:47,960
I mean, one guy smelled
my hair, but that's it.

1939
01:26:50,422 --> 01:26:53,007
Babe, what's wrong?

1940
01:26:57,888 --> 01:26:59,305
You told me this was over.

1941
01:26:59,390 --> 01:27:01,599
It is, but I feel like
she has a point.

1942
01:27:01,684 --> 01:27:02,433
I mean, we were together

1943
01:27:02,518 --> 01:27:04,852
so long, it makes sense
she at least wants to meet.

1944
01:27:04,937 --> 01:27:07,230
And go on a date with an
engaged person?

1945
01:27:07,314 --> 01:27:08,981
It's not a date, it's not a date.

1946
01:27:09,066 --> 01:27:11,150
You're going to dinner
alone with her.

1947
01:27:11,235 --> 01:27:12,276
Thys, it's a date.

1948
01:27:12,361 --> 01:27:14,028
You read the letters,
she just wants closure.

1949
01:27:14,113 --> 01:27:16,572
Yeah I know what she
wants, but what do you want?

1950
01:27:16,657 --> 01:27:19,826
I would love for
things to not be awkward

1951
01:27:19,910 --> 01:27:20,660
between me and her.

1952
01:27:20,744 --> 01:27:23,162
I mean, like, I feel
like I over that, right?

1953
01:27:23,247 --> 01:27:25,248
I used to take baths with this girl.

1954
01:27:25,332 --> 01:27:26,541
- That's not helping.
- When we were two.

1955
01:27:26,625 --> 01:27:27,917
I know Thys, you have

1956
01:27:28,001 --> 01:27:30,920
so much history with her and
that's what makes it so hard.

1957
01:27:33,048 --> 01:27:35,383
And you know, you keep saying

1958
01:27:35,467 --> 01:27:37,969
that you don't wanna make it awkward

1959
01:27:38,053 --> 01:27:39,804
for her and for her family,

1960
01:27:40,931 --> 01:27:43,391
but why don't you care about
making it awkward for me?

1961
01:27:43,475 --> 01:27:45,143
I do care.

1962
01:27:45,227 --> 01:27:48,271
Then why do you feel
like you have to do this?

1963
01:27:48,355 --> 01:27:52,024
If you don't want me
to go, I won't go, okay?

1964
01:27:52,109 --> 01:27:53,401
I will do whatever you say.

1965
01:27:54,570 --> 01:27:55,903
But if you let me do this,

1966
01:27:55,988 --> 01:27:59,073
I feel like it'll be the best for us.

1967
01:27:59,158 --> 01:27:59,949
How?

1968
01:28:01,285 --> 01:28:02,827
How can this be good for us?

1969
01:28:02,911 --> 01:28:04,954
I know it's confusing
and it isn't fair,

1970
01:28:05,038 --> 01:28:06,205
but it happens, okay?

1971
01:28:06,290 --> 01:28:08,666
It happened and I'm just trying
to be honest and communicate

1972
01:28:08,751 --> 01:28:10,752
with you and keep you
involved with the decision.

1973
01:28:10,836 --> 01:28:12,879
I thought that's what you
wanted me to do.

1974
01:28:23,307 --> 01:28:24,807
No come on, don't.

1975
01:28:27,060 --> 01:28:29,520
I know I wanna be with you, Thys,

1976
01:28:29,605 --> 01:28:32,148
and you can give that back
to me when you are sure

1977
01:28:32,232 --> 01:28:33,483
that you wanna be with me.

1978
01:28:58,008 --> 01:29:00,384
Honey, 07:45, you
wanna take a break?

1979
01:29:09,019 --> 01:29:09,852
Carrie, babe,

1980
01:29:11,605 --> 01:29:13,523
- hey, wow.
- Hey.

1981
01:29:13,607 --> 01:29:14,899
Look what you made me do.

1982
01:29:14,983 --> 01:29:16,150
Oh, you ruined my feathering.

1983
01:29:16,235 --> 01:29:18,778
Are you sure that's not
an improvement?

1984
01:29:18,862 --> 01:29:20,655
This is a lot
harder than it looks.

1985
01:29:20,739 --> 01:29:22,532
I dunno, it looks pretty hard.

1986
01:29:22,616 --> 01:29:24,242
Still you know, I think you
should get a professional

1987
01:29:24,326 --> 01:29:25,409
to do this.

1988
01:29:25,494 --> 01:29:28,663
We might be able to afford it
now I got that new job offer.

1989
01:29:28,747 --> 01:29:30,998
Shut up, serious?

1990
01:29:31,083 --> 01:29:31,916
Oh that's so great.

1991
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:33,376
They're called Little Wagon,

1992
01:29:33,460 --> 01:29:35,127
it's a smaller firm, but
they're great.

1993
01:29:35,212 --> 01:29:36,379
- Okay.
- So let's celebrate.

1994
01:29:36,463 --> 01:29:37,421
Get rid of those goggles.

1995
01:29:37,506 --> 01:29:38,339
I've got a surprise for you.

1996
01:29:38,423 --> 01:29:40,174
Oh, is it chicken parm?

1997
01:29:40,259 --> 01:29:42,134
No guessing, come here.

1998
01:29:42,219 --> 01:29:44,470
- All right, okay.
- Okay, all right,

1999
01:29:44,555 --> 01:29:47,265
big surprise, I'm going in.

2000
01:29:47,349 --> 01:29:50,810
Deserved a little something
special, so here we go.

2001
01:29:50,894 --> 01:29:53,396
You turkeys, what are you doing?

2002
01:29:53,480 --> 01:29:55,356
I thought
you set this up for us.

2003
01:29:55,440 --> 01:29:56,899
With the candles.

2004
01:29:56,984 --> 01:29:57,775
It was so good.

2005
01:29:57,860 --> 01:29:59,527
Oh, well that's great, I...

2006
01:29:59,611 --> 01:30:01,821
It's fine, it's not their fault.

2007
01:30:01,905 --> 01:30:03,239
I've been so busy planning.

2008
01:30:03,323 --> 01:30:06,033
You know that family's schedule
is totally out of wack.

2009
01:30:06,118 --> 01:30:07,618
All right, don't worry, boys,

2010
01:30:07,703 --> 01:30:10,037
all this wedding stuff
is going to be over soon.

2011
01:30:13,166 --> 01:30:15,418
- You made the right decision.
- Absolutely.

2012
01:30:17,087 --> 01:30:18,045
Just doesn't feel right.

2013
01:30:18,130 --> 01:30:20,464
Well, it's gonna be really hard

2014
01:30:20,549 --> 01:30:22,717
but if he comes back,
you're both gonna be

2015
01:30:22,801 --> 01:30:23,509
the stronger for it.

2016
01:30:23,594 --> 01:30:26,304
Yeah but mom, what if
he doesn't come back?

2017
01:30:26,388 --> 01:30:27,763
Then he's an idiot.

2018
01:30:27,848 --> 01:30:29,557
I'm sorry, but it's true.

2019
01:30:29,641 --> 01:30:31,225
But what do we do about the wedding?

2020
01:30:31,310 --> 01:30:32,768
We're not gonna overstress.

2021
01:30:32,853 --> 01:30:35,229
We're gonna move forward
as if it's happening

2022
01:30:35,314 --> 01:30:37,565
and if we get to that bridge,
we'll deal with it then.

2023
01:30:37,649 --> 01:30:40,318
Yeah but we'd done so much already

2024
01:30:40,402 --> 01:30:41,444
and we've spent so much money.

2025
01:30:41,528 --> 01:30:43,696
Listen I don't want
you to worry one minute

2026
01:30:43,780 --> 01:30:44,530
about the money, okay?

2027
01:30:44,615 --> 01:30:46,032
We can make more money

2028
01:30:46,116 --> 01:30:48,284
and Costco has a generous
return policy.

2029
01:30:48,368 --> 01:30:50,953
I just want you to worry
about getting this right

2030
01:30:51,038 --> 01:30:53,456
and while he's thinking things over,

2031
01:30:53,540 --> 01:30:55,082
you take this time to reconsider

2032
01:30:55,167 --> 01:30:57,543
if this is still
something that you want.

2033
01:30:57,628 --> 01:30:59,211
But I've made up my mind.

2034
01:30:59,296 --> 01:31:01,923
I know, but things have changed.

2035
01:31:02,007 --> 01:31:03,549
This is new information.

2036
01:31:03,634 --> 01:31:05,092
Why is everything falling apart?

2037
01:31:05,177 --> 01:31:06,802
This is my engagement.

2038
01:31:06,887 --> 01:31:09,513
This is supposed to be
the best time of my life.

2039
01:31:09,598 --> 01:31:10,765
Wait, who told you that?

2040
01:31:10,849 --> 01:31:15,144
Everyone, I mean movies,
Instagram, you guys.

2041
01:31:15,228 --> 01:31:17,897
Oh, we did not have
the perfect engagement.

2042
01:31:17,981 --> 01:31:20,107
Things got a little
hairy for a minute there,

2043
01:31:20,192 --> 01:31:22,360
thought I was gonna get
my heartbroken.

2044
01:31:22,444 --> 01:31:23,611
For real?

2045
01:31:23,695 --> 01:31:25,446
Yeah, well I had my doubts.

2046
01:31:25,530 --> 01:31:26,948
I mean, I knew I loved your father,

2047
01:31:27,032 --> 01:31:28,366
but I had feelings come up

2048
01:31:28,450 --> 01:31:30,409
for someone else,
someone from my past.

2049
01:31:30,494 --> 01:31:31,577
Daniel Gregory.

2050
01:31:31,662 --> 01:31:32,703
His name's not important.

2051
01:31:32,788 --> 01:31:35,581
Anyway, they were real
emotions that I had to deal

2052
01:31:35,666 --> 01:31:38,918
with and lucky for me, your
father was really patient.

2053
01:31:39,002 --> 01:31:40,586
How do I not know about this?

2054
01:31:40,671 --> 01:31:44,131
I don’t know, I guess I just
don't like to think about it.

2055
01:31:44,216 --> 01:31:46,050
Engagements are the worst.

2056
01:31:46,134 --> 01:31:48,761
I mean, they're the worst
because they're the best.

2057
01:31:48,845 --> 01:31:51,597
It's a trial time that God gives us

2058
01:31:51,682 --> 01:31:53,724
to really test out our relationship

2059
01:31:53,809 --> 01:31:57,645
before we make the biggest
commitment of our lives.

2060
01:31:57,729 --> 01:31:59,897
You have the right to change your mind

2061
01:31:59,982 --> 01:32:01,107
from the second you put

2062
01:32:01,191 --> 01:32:03,651
on that ring to the moment
you kneel at the altar.

2063
01:32:05,612 --> 01:32:08,239
Why didn't you tell me it
would be this exhausting?

2064
01:32:09,449 --> 01:32:11,117
I guess we kind of forgot.

2065
01:32:11,201 --> 01:32:11,909
We've been together

2066
01:32:11,994 --> 01:32:15,204
so long, it’s hard to
remember our lives before.

2067
01:32:15,288 --> 01:32:19,542
Honestly, I just, I just
want what you guys have.

2068
01:32:19,626 --> 01:32:22,586
Oh sweetie, you'll get there,
I promise.

2069
01:32:24,798 --> 01:32:26,716
Hey, can I use my screen time?

2070
01:32:26,800 --> 01:32:27,591
Tyler.

It feels really weird.

2108
01:35:40,410 --> 01:35:42,620
Yeah, I don't know why
my mom insisted,

2109
01:35:42,704 --> 01:35:44,747
but you've made her very happy.

2110
01:35:45,624 --> 01:35:48,709
Think she just wants to show
you off to all of her friends.

2111
01:35:48,793 --> 01:35:51,170
You know, it's bad luck
to see a bride

2112
01:35:51,254 --> 01:35:53,088
in her wedding dress
before the big day.

2113
01:35:53,173 --> 01:35:56,634
And how can something
this beautiful be bad luck?

2114
01:35:56,718 --> 01:35:58,385
Come on, I wanna show you how too.

2115
01:35:59,387 --> 01:36:00,387
How many layers is this?

2116
01:36:00,472 --> 01:36:02,932
- It’s a lot.
- It's a lot, yeah.

2117
01:36:03,016 --> 01:36:04,225
- Mark, hey.
- Hi.

2118
01:36:05,060 --> 01:36:06,352
- Mark Lee.
- Hi.

2119
01:36:06,436 --> 01:36:07,645
It's wonderful to meet you.

2120
01:36:07,729 --> 01:36:08,938
And I'm Alison.

2121
01:36:09,022 --> 01:36:10,773
We’ve heard such amazing things.

2122
01:36:10,857 --> 01:36:11,690
So have I.

2123
01:36:11,775 --> 01:36:13,525
We'd love you to meet our Bridget.

2124
01:36:16,488 --> 01:36:18,030
- Hi.
- Hi.

2125
01:36:18,114 --> 01:36:20,199
Congratulations honestly.

2126
01:36:20,283 --> 01:36:24,411
Congratulations to you too,
for just being a great person

2127
01:36:24,496 --> 01:36:27,039
and yeah, the whole mission thing.

2128
01:36:27,123 --> 01:36:29,667
That’s a really big deal.

2129
01:36:29,751 --> 01:36:32,503
Thank you, yeah, no, it was
a really great experience.

2130
01:36:35,298 --> 01:36:36,799
If I could have
everyone please be seated,

2131
01:36:36,883 --> 01:36:37,633
we'd like to start

2132
01:36:37,717 --> 01:36:40,386
- the festivities.
- Good to see you.

2133
01:36:40,470 --> 01:36:41,929
- Talk to you later.
- Yeah, please.

2134
01:36:45,267 --> 01:36:46,725
Why didn’t you tell me
she was coming?

2135
01:36:46,810 --> 01:36:47,726
What's the big deal?

2136
01:36:47,811 --> 01:36:48,560
I thought we were over this.

2137
01:36:48,645 --> 01:36:49,603
Are you over it?

2138
01:36:49,688 --> 01:36:50,688
You should get to know her actually.

2139
01:36:50,772 --> 01:36:52,231
She's a really great person.

2140
01:36:52,315 --> 01:36:54,566
Maybe I should just make
her one of my bridesmaids.

2141
01:36:54,651 --> 01:36:56,277
Please don't make this weird.

2142
01:36:56,361 --> 01:36:58,362
Everything's fine, for once,
let's just have some fun

2143
01:36:58,446 --> 01:36:59,863
tonight with no drama.

2144
01:37:01,032 --> 01:37:01,865
Okay.

2145
01:37:03,034 --> 01:37:05,202
You know, it's kind of
ironic that Thys asked me

2146
01:37:05,287 --> 01:37:07,746
to be his best man considering
I was his worst brother.

2147
01:37:08,665 --> 01:37:11,250
So that makes him either
the biggest moron

2148
01:37:12,168 --> 01:37:15,004
Or the most forgiving
guy that I've ever met.

2149
01:37:15,088 --> 01:37:16,630
I'm proud to be your brother.

2150
01:37:18,300 --> 01:37:19,383
- Love you, man.
- Love you, buddy.

2151
01:37:19,467 --> 01:37:20,467
You're the best.

2152
01:37:20,552 --> 01:37:22,469
And Bree, I did not
forget about you.

2153
01:37:22,554 --> 01:37:23,762
I know that we don't know each other

2154
01:37:23,847 --> 01:37:25,347
that well yet, so you might not care

2155
01:37:25,432 --> 01:37:27,683
what I have to say, but
I think I have a message

2156
01:37:27,767 --> 01:37:29,935
from somebody you do care about.

2157
01:37:30,020 --> 01:37:30,811
Oh, who could it be?

2158
01:37:30,895 --> 01:37:32,688
Who does Derek have a direct line to?

2159
01:37:34,024 --> 01:37:37,609
He really wanted to be here
tonight, but he, you know,

2160
01:37:37,694 --> 01:37:38,902
I guess he's a busy guy.

2161
01:37:38,987 --> 01:37:40,529
So if you could direct your attention

2162
01:37:40,613 --> 01:37:43,282
to the back, I have a
special message for you.

2163
01:37:43,366 --> 01:37:45,951
Reading from our nation's Capitol.

2164
01:37:46,036 --> 01:37:46,869
I'd like to take a moment

2165
01:37:46,953 --> 01:37:50,122
and offer a special congratulations
to Thys Chesterfield

2166
01:37:50,206 --> 01:37:53,292
and his lovely fiance,
Bree Carrington.

2167
01:37:53,376 --> 01:37:55,169
Tomorrow's the day
you've always dreamed of,

2168
01:37:55,253 --> 01:37:57,504
now make that dream come true.

2169
01:37:57,589 --> 01:38:00,299

Dear Bree,
I know this is crazy,

2180
01:39:18,795 --> 01:39:22,965
but for the first time in my
life, I don't know what to say.

2181
01:39:23,049 --> 01:39:24,925
We're supposed to write
something that will help you

2182
01:39:25,009 --> 01:39:26,760
prepare for your big day.

2183
01:39:26,845 --> 01:39:29,638
But I mean, I'm 13, what do I know?

2184
01:39:30,640 --> 01:39:33,058
I'm not gonna make a list
of marriage qualities

2185
01:39:33,143 --> 01:39:35,894
because if your fiance has
already won mom's approval,

2186
01:39:35,979 --> 01:39:37,563
you know he's a catch.

2187
01:39:37,647 --> 01:39:40,315
So I'm gonna take it to
the next level.

2188
01:39:40,400 --> 01:39:41,316
The thought that keeps coming

2189
01:39:41,401 --> 01:39:43,819
to my mind is just to be brave.

2190
01:39:44,696 --> 01:39:46,488
You know that as much
as we've been excited

2191
01:39:46,573 --> 01:39:49,575
for it, we've always been a
bit scared to get married.

2192
01:39:49,659 --> 01:39:52,703
I mean, how do you ever
know that it's truly right?

2193
01:39:53,705 --> 01:39:56,373
The answer is maybe you don't.

2194
01:39:56,458 --> 01:39:58,959
Maybe the best we can do
is make a choice.

2195
01:39:59,919 --> 01:40:02,463
If what you choose
makes you feel peaceful,

2196
01:40:02,547 --> 01:40:03,589
be brave about it.

2197
01:40:04,424 --> 01:40:07,050
If it doesn't, be brave
about that too.

2198
01:40:08,094 --> 01:40:10,846
That’s it, just be brave.

2199
01:40:10,930 --> 01:40:12,556
Sincerely, yourself.

2200
01:40:15,185 --> 01:40:17,436
The night we broke
up was the hardest thing

2201
01:40:17,520 --> 01:40:20,772
I've ever experienced in
my entire life,

2202
01:40:20,857 --> 01:40:22,816
but I knew I had to do it.

2203
01:40:22,901 --> 01:40:26,487
I had to listen to my 13
year old self.

2204
01:40:26,571 --> 01:40:27,946
I had to be brave.

2205
01:40:29,407 --> 01:40:34,369
As much as Thys loved me, he
somehow wasn't to put us first.

2206
01:40:34,454 --> 01:40:35,746
I loved spending time

2207
01:40:35,830 --> 01:40:38,248
with him, but I never felt
completely safe

2208
01:40:38,333 --> 01:40:41,752
or at peace when I was with him.

2209
01:40:41,836 --> 01:40:44,505
I know Thys will grow to
be a great man

2210
01:40:44,589 --> 01:40:49,510
and he will make a great
husband, just not the one for me.

2211
01:40:51,679 --> 01:40:52,971
It's a horrible realization

2212
01:40:53,056 --> 01:40:55,057
to have the day before your wedding,

2213
01:40:56,017 --> 01:40:58,393
but that's how long it
took me to figure it out.

2214
01:41:12,033 --> 01:41:13,825
Oh my brave little Bree.

2215
01:41:19,582 --> 01:41:22,167
The next morning when I
saw my family,

2216
01:41:22,252 --> 01:41:26,255
I remembered what it was like
to feel completely safe again.

2217
01:41:31,553 --> 01:41:33,554
Why are you guys all dressed up?

2218
01:41:35,932 --> 01:41:37,766
Well.

2219
01:41:41,145 --> 01:41:42,062
Apparently bud was

2220
01:41:42,146 --> 01:41:43,939
so inspired by the wedding spirit,

2221
01:41:44,023 --> 01:41:47,484
he proposed a sister
Rockwell that very morning.

2222
01:41:47,569 --> 01:41:51,697
Not one to waste time or money,
she decided to carpe diem.

2223
01:41:56,411 --> 01:41:58,078
And the smile on her face helped me

2224
01:41:58,162 --> 01:42:00,163
forget my pain for a moment.

2235
01:42:57,555 --> 01:43:00,140
I was worried about
talking to people that night.

2236
01:43:01,100 --> 01:43:02,768
I thought they wouldn't understand,

2237
01:43:02,852 --> 01:43:05,187
that they would judge
me for calling it off

2238
01:43:06,064 --> 01:43:10,359
so late, but in truth, everyone
was really understanding.

2239
01:43:10,443 --> 01:43:14,029
Turns out a lot of people
have stories just like mine,

2240
01:43:14,113 --> 01:43:17,074
broken hearts, broken engagements,

2241
01:43:17,158 --> 01:43:19,660
and of course, broken marriages.

2242
01:43:21,204 --> 01:43:23,747
People ask me if I had
the chance to do it all

2243
01:43:23,831 --> 01:43:26,124
over again, would I change anything?

2244
01:43:27,377 --> 01:43:29,044
It's hard to say.

2245
01:43:29,128 --> 01:43:30,962
Sure, I would have saved myself a lot

2246
01:43:31,047 --> 01:43:34,424
of heartache and saved my
parents a lot of money.

2247
01:43:35,718 --> 01:43:38,387
But that experience became
a part of who I am today.

2248
01:43:39,597 --> 01:43:42,683
I made those choices and
I accept the consequences.

2249
01:43:43,601 --> 01:43:46,353
Honestly, I don't know if I
would change it if I could.

2250
01:43:48,022 --> 01:43:50,315
All I know is that I'm not ashamed

2251
01:43:50,400 --> 01:43:53,819
to say that once I was engaged.

2252
01:43:56,072 --> 01:43:57,364
So that’s my fun fact.

01:43:57,448 --> 01:43:58,907

- Hello, good afternoon.
- Hi, good afternoon.

2299
01:47:08,347 --> 01:47:09,723
I’m Sister Carrington

2300
01:47:09,807 --> 01:47:12,601
and this is my companion,
Sister Roblez.

2301
01:47:12,685 --> 01:47:14,019
We’re representatives of The Church

2302
01:47:14,103 --> 01:47:15,729
of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints.

2303
01:47:15,813 --> 01:47:18,565
I don't know if you've ever
heard of that church before.

2304
01:47:18,649 --> 01:47:19,900
Oh okay, great.

2305
01:47:19,984 --> 01:47:22,485
Well, we would just love to
share a message with you.
