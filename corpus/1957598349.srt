1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
(silence)

2
00:00:01,929 --> 00:00:05,179
(motorcycles rumbling)

3
00:00:07,655 --> 00:00:10,905
(energetic rock music)

4
00:01:50,237 --> 00:01:53,237
(upbeat rock music)

5
00:01:56,341 --> 00:01:58,140
- Man, the first thing I'm gonna do

6
00:01:58,141 --> 00:02:00,226
is chug down a couple gallons of brew.

7
00:02:00,227 --> 00:02:03,105
- Munch, we don't want
any trouble, you got me?

8
00:02:03,106 --> 00:02:04,907
- Yeah, sure, yeah, I got you.

9
00:02:04,908 --> 00:02:06,616
- I just have to make a phone call.

10
00:02:06,617 --> 00:02:09,617
(upbeat rock music)

11
00:02:13,717 --> 00:02:17,217
(laughing and chattering)

12
00:02:20,479 --> 00:02:21,528
(glass shattering)

13
00:02:21,529 --> 00:02:22,828
- Hey, it missed.

14
00:02:22,829 --> 00:02:24,079
It's cool, man.

15
00:02:25,584 --> 00:02:29,693
- Skin, get us two pitchers of
beer and make sure it's cold.

16
00:02:29,694 --> 00:02:32,347
(laughing and chattering)

17
00:02:32,348 --> 00:02:34,265
- Two pitchers of beer.

18
00:02:35,554 --> 00:02:37,450
(sniffing)

19
00:02:37,451 --> 00:02:39,703
- Knock it off, I don't want
you gettin' out of control.

20
00:02:39,704 --> 00:02:43,204
(laughing and chattering)

21
00:02:48,401 --> 00:02:52,568
Okay, now, get me a newspaper,
and not some rag either.

22
00:02:54,736 --> 00:02:56,108
- Where can I get a newspaper?

23
00:02:56,109 --> 00:02:57,111
- [Bartender] Across the street.

24
00:02:57,112 --> 00:02:58,112
- Thanks.

25
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:00,810
- Hey, mama!

26
00:03:00,811 --> 00:03:01,811
Hey, baby!

27
00:03:02,798 --> 00:03:04,999
Come on over here. (smooches)

28
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,015
Come here.
- What?

29
00:03:06,016 --> 00:03:08,349
(smooching)

30
00:03:09,319 --> 00:03:10,626
- Come here, baby.
- Let's go.

31
00:03:10,627 --> 00:03:12,960
(smooching)

32
00:03:16,052 --> 00:03:16,885
- What's the matter?

33
00:03:16,886 --> 00:03:17,981
- Shut up!

34
00:03:17,982 --> 00:03:21,232
(energetic rock music)

35
00:03:26,571 --> 00:03:28,666
Yeah, Freedman, Williams, and Levitt Inc.,

36
00:03:28,667 --> 00:03:30,334
give me Mark Levitt.

37
00:03:31,184 --> 00:03:33,209
I don't care if he's in
a meeting, get him out.

38
00:03:33,210 --> 00:03:35,490
Tell him it's Reaper.

39
00:03:35,491 --> 00:03:37,274
My first name?

40
00:03:37,275 --> 00:03:39,942
Grim, Grim Reaper, now, get him.

41
00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:45,544
Levitt, you schmuck, what
the hell is with my stock?

42
00:03:45,545 --> 00:03:46,654
What do you mean down a little?

43
00:03:46,655 --> 00:03:49,023
It's in the crapper!

44
00:03:49,024 --> 00:03:52,186
Now, you listen to me, man,
if it's not back up in a week,

45
00:03:52,187 --> 00:03:56,273
me and my friends are gonna pay
a little visit to your wife.

46
00:03:56,274 --> 00:03:59,357
Think she can handle three at a time?

47
00:04:02,998 --> 00:04:05,550
(people chattering)

48
00:04:05,551 --> 00:04:06,634
- Wade Olson?

49
00:04:08,144 --> 00:04:09,873
Is your name Wade Olson?

50
00:04:09,874 --> 00:04:12,240
- Olson, we've got a bench
warrant for your arrest.

51
00:04:12,241 --> 00:04:16,408
Keep your hands on the bar
and stand up nice and slow.

52
00:04:22,787 --> 00:04:25,370
(men grunting)

53
00:04:29,086 --> 00:04:29,919
- Man, did you see that?

54
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:32,364
He put his foot right in that pig's face!

55
00:04:32,365 --> 00:04:33,671
- Okay, we're outta here?

56
00:04:33,672 --> 00:04:34,631
- Why?

57
00:04:34,631 --> 00:04:35,464
- Because in 10 minutes,

58
00:04:35,465 --> 00:04:37,250
this place is gonna be crawling with heat.

59
00:04:37,251 --> 00:04:38,501
You wanna stay?

60
00:04:42,828 --> 00:04:44,702
Where are you riding, hardass?

61
00:04:44,703 --> 00:04:47,703
- Straight to hell, the same as you.

62
00:04:51,570 --> 00:04:54,670
(motorcycles rumbling)

63
00:04:54,671 --> 00:04:55,700
- You bastard!

64
00:04:55,701 --> 00:04:56,534
(laughing)

65
00:04:56,535 --> 00:04:59,451
(glass shattering)

66
00:05:00,979 --> 00:05:04,229
(energetic rock music)

67
00:05:15,844 --> 00:05:19,094
(motorcycles rumbling)

68
00:05:24,026 --> 00:05:26,443
(chattering)

69
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,567
- Those cops in L.A., what
did they want you for?

70
00:05:32,568 --> 00:05:37,201
- They impounded my bike,
but I impounded it back.

71
00:05:37,202 --> 00:05:38,230
- That's it?

72
00:05:38,231 --> 00:05:41,064
- Well, there's a little bit more.

73
00:05:42,105 --> 00:05:44,054
- You got any money?

74
00:05:44,055 --> 00:05:45,055
- Nope.

75
00:05:47,155 --> 00:05:48,954
- Maybe you can make some.

76
00:05:48,955 --> 00:05:51,955
(soft guitar music)

77
00:05:54,701 --> 00:05:55,701
- Hey, man.

78
00:05:56,892 --> 00:05:59,719
What you did to them pigs in the bar,

79
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:00,901
I dug it!

80
00:06:00,902 --> 00:06:03,535
Where'd you learn that stuff, man?

81
00:06:03,536 --> 00:06:07,585
- I studied it for 15
years with a zen master,

82
00:06:07,586 --> 00:06:09,607
then I snapped his neck.

83
00:06:09,608 --> 00:06:11,858
(laughing)

84
00:06:13,936 --> 00:06:14,936
- Ow!

85
00:06:17,862 --> 00:06:19,242
- What's the problem, Ronny?

86
00:06:19,243 --> 00:06:23,226
Your back hurt? (laughs)

87
00:06:23,227 --> 00:06:25,828
- Hey, Wade, what's wrong with your bike?

88
00:06:25,829 --> 00:06:28,250
- Ever since the pigs had
it, it don't feel right.

89
00:06:28,251 --> 00:06:30,775
- They sure know how to
fuck things up, don't they?

90
00:06:30,776 --> 00:06:31,609
- Who?

91
00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:33,028
- Pigs, dammit.

92
00:06:33,029 --> 00:06:34,283
- I hate 'em.

93
00:06:34,284 --> 00:06:37,083
- Hey, man, can you imagine
what the world would be like

94
00:06:37,084 --> 00:06:38,501
without the pigs?

95
00:06:39,788 --> 00:06:41,371
- No law and order.

96
00:06:42,378 --> 00:06:43,787
- Paradise.

97
00:06:43,788 --> 00:06:47,955
(soft guitar music)
(fire crackling)

98
00:06:54,322 --> 00:06:57,215
- Wade, you're gonna ride with us today.

99
00:06:57,216 --> 00:06:58,470
- What's going down?

100
00:06:58,471 --> 00:07:00,824
- Business transaction, two-hour ride.

101
00:07:00,825 --> 00:07:01,936
- What's in it for me?

102
00:07:01,937 --> 00:07:05,477
- 100 bucks and six grand,
except you might have to earn it.

103
00:07:05,478 --> 00:07:07,935
Twice before, some asshole's
tried to take this shit.

104
00:07:07,936 --> 00:07:10,024
- [Wade] What happened?

105
00:07:10,025 --> 00:07:12,275
(laughing)

106
00:07:13,383 --> 00:07:15,766
(car rumbling)

107
00:07:15,767 --> 00:07:19,934
(lively music with man singing in Spanish)

108
00:07:26,236 --> 00:07:28,819
(car creaking)

109
00:07:42,965 --> 00:07:45,882
(mysterious music)

110
00:07:47,622 --> 00:07:50,289
(pensive music)

111
00:07:52,329 --> 00:07:54,579
- Hey, man, watch this guy.

112
00:07:55,954 --> 00:07:57,287
He's a magician.

113
00:07:59,202 --> 00:08:01,758
- What do you use to cut it with?

114
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:04,210
- Anything I can, man.

115
00:08:04,211 --> 00:08:06,461
I don't give a fuck.

116
00:08:06,462 --> 00:08:08,978
Mostly, I use baby laxative,

117
00:08:08,979 --> 00:08:13,368
but I've used Epsom salt,
baking soda, and soap too.

118
00:08:13,369 --> 00:08:16,598
People don't give a shit
if their nose rots out,

119
00:08:16,599 --> 00:08:18,886
as long as they get high.

120
00:08:18,887 --> 00:08:21,324
- Hey, Nose, give me a hit, huh?

121
00:08:21,325 --> 00:08:23,271
- You got your own, Munch.

122
00:08:23,272 --> 00:08:25,412
- Aw, come on, man, I'm out.

123
00:08:25,413 --> 00:08:27,317
- [Nose] You're always out.

124
00:08:27,318 --> 00:08:29,484
- [Man] Yeah, out of your mind.

125
00:08:29,485 --> 00:08:31,014
- [Man] He never had a mind.

126
00:08:31,015 --> 00:08:34,255
- You ever seen that much coke before?

127
00:08:34,256 --> 00:08:36,098
- [Wade] Maybe.

128
00:08:36,099 --> 00:08:37,799
Reaper do coke?

129
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:39,518
- Never touches it.

130
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:43,686
He says it burns out a man's
spirit, whatever that means.

131
00:08:59,855 --> 00:09:03,143
♫ I'm a shotgun, ooh

132
00:09:03,144 --> 00:09:06,608
♫ Goin' out of my head

133
00:09:06,609 --> 00:09:10,094
♫ I'm shakin' all over

134
00:09:10,095 --> 00:09:13,546
♫ But not in there

135
00:09:13,547 --> 00:09:17,018
♫ I'm gonna say it one time, oh

136
00:09:17,019 --> 00:09:20,622
♫ I won't say it again

137
00:09:20,623 --> 00:09:24,055
♫ You're too much for me, lady

138
00:09:24,056 --> 00:09:27,612
♫ Oh, this is the end

139
00:09:27,613 --> 00:09:31,010
♫ It's too late to be my lover

140
00:09:31,011 --> 00:09:32,836
♫ I gotta stop

141
00:09:32,837 --> 00:09:36,337
(laughing and chattering)

142
00:09:40,365 --> 00:09:42,532
(hooting)

143
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:47,063
- Bakersfield, 10 pounds.

144
00:09:48,243 --> 00:09:50,160
Santa Cruz, six pounds.

145
00:09:51,587 --> 00:09:53,254
Fresno, four pounds.

146
00:09:54,764 --> 00:09:56,141
What's this?

147
00:09:56,142 --> 00:09:57,998
Ukiah, 10 pounds.

148
00:09:57,999 --> 00:09:59,114
All right.

149
00:09:59,115 --> 00:09:59,948
Let's go.

150
00:09:59,949 --> 00:10:01,388
- Hey!

151
00:10:01,389 --> 00:10:03,329
How many times you get picked up tonight?

152
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:05,747
(chattering)

153
00:10:07,499 --> 00:10:09,999
(tense music)

154
00:10:20,247 --> 00:10:23,340
(ominous music)

155
00:10:23,341 --> 00:10:25,341
- Remember, no mistakes!

156
00:10:28,516 --> 00:10:32,115
Make sure it snows this Christmas.

157
00:10:32,116 --> 00:10:33,381
See you in Vegas!

158
00:10:33,382 --> 00:10:36,049
(ominous music)

159
00:10:41,323 --> 00:10:43,200
Here's where you're making
your Vegas deliveries tonight.

160
00:10:43,201 --> 00:10:44,828
This one's a hotel.

161
00:10:44,829 --> 00:10:45,677
Don't worry, it's a dump.

162
00:10:45,678 --> 00:10:46,983
You'll fit right in.

163
00:10:46,984 --> 00:10:48,991
This one's a bar.

164
00:10:48,992 --> 00:10:52,575
This one's a parking
lot, don't fuck it up.

165
00:10:54,751 --> 00:10:55,584
- I'm droppin' my shit off

166
00:10:55,585 --> 00:10:57,122
and I'm headin' straight downtown.

167
00:10:57,123 --> 00:10:58,477
They got some hookers on Fifth Street

168
00:10:58,478 --> 00:11:02,645
that'll do anything you want,
and I mean anything. (laughs)

169
00:11:04,572 --> 00:11:07,110
- Yeah, well, first, I'm hittin' the bars.

170
00:11:07,111 --> 00:11:09,374
- Man, you can drink here!

171
00:11:09,375 --> 00:11:11,508
I'm goin' out to party.
- Come on!

172
00:11:11,509 --> 00:11:14,676
(motorcycle rumbling)

173
00:11:33,815 --> 00:11:36,315
(tense music)

174
00:11:38,815 --> 00:11:42,982
(rattling)
(wind blowing)

175
00:11:57,075 --> 00:11:58,825
- Hello, anyone here?

176
00:11:59,748 --> 00:12:03,848
- Uh, I don't think we're
supposed to be in here.

177
00:12:03,849 --> 00:12:08,016
(tense music builds)
(motorcycles rumbling)

178
00:12:09,696 --> 00:12:10,529
(hiccups)

179
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:12,779
(laughing)

180
00:12:21,881 --> 00:12:23,860
- Man, we wasted the whole day.

181
00:12:23,861 --> 00:12:25,605
We gotta do something.

182
00:12:25,606 --> 00:12:27,340
- Go back to the car.

183
00:12:27,341 --> 00:12:29,431
- We can't, it's dead.

184
00:12:29,432 --> 00:12:30,265
(laughing)

185
00:12:30,266 --> 00:12:33,055
- [Woman] We've gotta
wait for those people.

186
00:12:33,056 --> 00:12:35,693
They left their stuff, so
they must be coming back.

187
00:12:35,694 --> 00:12:38,944
(motorcycles rumbling)

188
00:12:45,082 --> 00:12:47,357
(lively music with woman singing)

189
00:12:47,358 --> 00:12:48,839
- What the hell's that?

190
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:50,145
- Sounds like a party.

191
00:12:50,146 --> 00:12:50,979
- Let's find out.

192
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:54,062
♫ My heart's on fire

193
00:12:59,075 --> 00:13:00,870
♫ I got a reason to believe

194
00:13:00,871 --> 00:13:02,496
- Well!

195
00:13:02,497 --> 00:13:04,976
It's about time you got home.

196
00:13:04,977 --> 00:13:05,977
- Yeah.

197
00:13:07,067 --> 00:13:08,348
Who are you?

198
00:13:08,349 --> 00:13:10,516
- Turn off the music.

199
00:13:10,517 --> 00:13:13,620
Well, well, well, what do we got here?

200
00:13:13,621 --> 00:13:15,123
Give me some light.

201
00:13:15,124 --> 00:13:18,126
- Oh, man, like, this
is too much! (laughs)

202
00:13:18,127 --> 00:13:20,356
- Excuse me, are you in charge here?

203
00:13:20,357 --> 00:13:22,749
You see, we had a little
trouble with our car,

204
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:25,274
and we got lost, and we walked all day,

205
00:13:25,275 --> 00:13:27,033
and then we found this place.

206
00:13:27,034 --> 00:13:28,945
(shushing)

207
00:13:28,946 --> 00:13:31,268
- From now on, I tell you when to talk.

208
00:13:31,269 --> 00:13:33,936
(women gasping)

209
00:13:35,942 --> 00:13:39,033
- [Woman] Please, don't hurt us.

210
00:13:39,034 --> 00:13:40,034
- Hurt you?

211
00:13:41,225 --> 00:13:42,951
Now, look at us.

212
00:13:42,952 --> 00:13:44,458
Do my people look like the kinda guys

213
00:13:44,459 --> 00:13:45,852
that would do somethin' like that?

214
00:13:45,853 --> 00:13:48,646
(laughing)

215
00:13:48,647 --> 00:13:50,510
- Hey, Reaper,

216
00:13:50,511 --> 00:13:51,986
what are we gonna do with 'em?

217
00:13:51,987 --> 00:13:54,487
(tense music)

218
00:13:58,253 --> 00:13:59,709
- Everything.

219
00:13:59,710 --> 00:14:02,293
(wind blowing)

220
00:14:05,903 --> 00:14:07,182
- My father has a lot of money.

221
00:14:07,183 --> 00:14:09,374
He will pay you to let us go.

222
00:14:09,375 --> 00:14:12,344
- I got lots of money too.

223
00:14:12,345 --> 00:14:13,597
Munch, where are your manners?

224
00:14:13,598 --> 00:14:17,181
Aren't you gonna offer
the ladies anything?

225
00:14:20,031 --> 00:14:22,781
Don't you puke, or I'll shoot ya!

226
00:14:24,504 --> 00:14:28,270
- Well, are we gonna party, man, or what?

227
00:14:28,271 --> 00:14:30,766
- Yeah, we still got time
before Simon's flight.

228
00:14:30,767 --> 00:14:33,923
Reptile, bring out the worms.

229
00:14:33,924 --> 00:14:36,112
- What are you gonna do to us?

230
00:14:36,113 --> 00:14:37,732
- We're gonna play a little game, Heather.

231
00:14:37,733 --> 00:14:38,566
(women crying)

232
00:14:38,567 --> 00:14:39,636
You like games.

233
00:14:39,637 --> 00:14:42,065
Don't you wanna play with me, Heather?

234
00:14:42,066 --> 00:14:45,174
Didn't your father ever play
games with you, Heather?

235
00:14:45,175 --> 00:14:46,486
Say, "Yes, Reaper."

236
00:14:46,487 --> 00:14:48,957
- (crying) Yes, Reaper.

237
00:14:48,958 --> 00:14:49,791
- Yeah!

238
00:14:49,791 --> 00:14:50,629
- Whoa!

239
00:14:50,629 --> 00:14:51,629
- Yeah!

240
00:14:52,739 --> 00:14:54,235
(woman screaming)

241
00:14:54,236 --> 00:14:55,403
- Shut her up!

242
00:14:56,969 --> 00:14:58,616
Nobody seems to like snakes,

243
00:14:58,617 --> 00:15:02,016
but they're actually perfect
creatures, right, Reptile?

244
00:15:02,017 --> 00:15:03,614
- [Reptile] Right, Reaper.

245
00:15:03,615 --> 00:15:05,197
- Some people think they're dangerous,

246
00:15:05,198 --> 00:15:09,859
but every move they make
is programmed by God.

247
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:10,959
(Reptile laughing menacingly)
(women screaming)

248
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,687
- [Munch] Oh, yeah!

249
00:15:12,688 --> 00:15:13,600
Oh, look at that!

250
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:14,436
(men laughing)

251
00:15:14,437 --> 00:15:16,279
Look at that one, man!

252
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:17,495
- What's your name?
- Her, her!

253
00:15:17,496 --> 00:15:21,665
(women screaming)
- It's a party!

254
00:15:21,666 --> 00:15:23,016
- Kim!

255
00:15:23,017 --> 00:15:27,184
(women screaming)
(energetic rock music)

256
00:15:46,077 --> 00:15:48,660
(woman crying)

257
00:15:51,184 --> 00:15:52,930
- Now you're ready.

258
00:15:52,931 --> 00:15:54,339
(screaming)

259
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:57,645
(energetic rock music)

260
00:15:57,646 --> 00:16:00,813
(motorcycle rumbling)

261
00:16:02,836 --> 00:16:05,086
(thudding)

262
00:16:08,345 --> 00:16:09,707
- Shit!

263
00:16:09,708 --> 00:16:11,754
What do you want me to do with her?

264
00:16:11,755 --> 00:16:14,090
- Take her back inside.

265
00:16:14,091 --> 00:16:16,428
Let's wrap it up, we
gotta meet Simon's plane.

266
00:16:16,429 --> 00:16:20,037
Curtis, take 'em back in the
schoolhouse and keep 'em there.

267
00:16:20,038 --> 00:16:23,117
Reptile, put your pets away.

268
00:16:23,118 --> 00:16:27,265
(grunts)
(energetic rock music)

269
00:16:27,266 --> 00:16:30,732
(ominous music)

270
00:16:30,733 --> 00:16:33,983
(motorcycles rumbling)

271
00:16:38,333 --> 00:16:40,964
- What are we gonna do?

272
00:16:40,965 --> 00:16:42,590
- Run away?

273
00:16:42,591 --> 00:16:44,075
- Where?

274
00:16:44,076 --> 00:16:47,436
- Even if we could get
away, what's the difference?

275
00:16:47,437 --> 00:16:49,114
The car's still dead

276
00:16:49,115 --> 00:16:52,534
and we're still lost in
the middle of nowhere.

277
00:16:52,535 --> 00:16:54,806
- Well, what do you think
they're gonna do to us?

278
00:16:54,807 --> 00:16:56,552
- Maybe they'll fix our car.

279
00:16:56,553 --> 00:16:58,924
- [Woman] Linda, they're hell's
angels, for Christ's sake!

280
00:16:58,925 --> 00:16:59,926
- Worse!
(women gasp)

281
00:16:59,927 --> 00:17:02,245
(shushing) Don't worry, I won't hurt you.

282
00:17:02,246 --> 00:17:03,304
I ain't with them.

283
00:17:03,305 --> 00:17:05,696
They don't know I'm here so keep quiet.

284
00:17:05,697 --> 00:17:06,530
- Who are you?

285
00:17:06,531 --> 00:17:07,736
- Name's Jake.

286
00:17:07,737 --> 00:17:09,311
I'm a prospector.

287
00:17:09,312 --> 00:17:12,268
- So, Reaper, this is
the last one for ya, huh?

288
00:17:12,269 --> 00:17:13,579
- Yeah, after tonight, you and Needles

289
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:15,497
can make your own deal with Simon.

290
00:17:15,498 --> 00:17:17,513
I'm off to Mexico.

291
00:17:17,514 --> 00:17:18,676
- We're off to Mexico.

292
00:17:18,677 --> 00:17:21,470
- [Man] Hey, man, are you
sure you can live down there?

293
00:17:21,471 --> 00:17:23,635
You're gonna be bored shitless.

294
00:17:23,636 --> 00:17:25,662
- I'm never bored.

295
00:17:25,663 --> 00:17:29,343
I once spent three months
in solitary, total darkness.

296
00:17:29,344 --> 00:17:31,503
I just look inside.

297
00:17:31,504 --> 00:17:33,254
There's a lot to see.

298
00:17:34,152 --> 00:17:37,202
- Hey, man, what about those chicks?

299
00:17:37,203 --> 00:17:39,302
- One of 'em's already dead.

300
00:17:39,303 --> 00:17:40,584
Maybe we ought to take the rest of 'em,

301
00:17:40,585 --> 00:17:42,910
bury in the old town cemetery.

302
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:45,396
- Nah, man, let's drug 'em up
and keep 'em here for a while

303
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:46,800
and party with 'em!

304
00:17:46,801 --> 00:17:49,384
- Reaper, you can't let 'em go.

305
00:17:50,347 --> 00:17:51,687
They know too much.

306
00:17:51,688 --> 00:17:54,222
- Till tomorrow, I do
the thinkin' around here.

307
00:17:54,223 --> 00:17:58,691
- Reaper, you wouldn't
really kill them, would you?

308
00:17:58,692 --> 00:18:00,891
- Might even kill you.

309
00:18:00,892 --> 00:18:03,508
- But Reaper, I did
everything you asked me to.

310
00:18:03,509 --> 00:18:04,994
You said you'd take care of me.

311
00:18:04,995 --> 00:18:07,123
- Aw, shut up, why don't
you go back to Podunk

312
00:18:07,124 --> 00:18:10,957
or Peoria, or wherever
the hell you came from?

313
00:18:15,413 --> 00:18:17,016
Wade?

314
00:18:17,017 --> 00:18:20,970
- I had a funny feelin' about you, man.

315
00:18:20,971 --> 00:18:22,157
- I'm clean.

316
00:18:22,158 --> 00:18:23,706
- Bullshit!

317
00:18:23,707 --> 00:18:25,761
You tryin' to rip me off,

318
00:18:25,762 --> 00:18:27,179
or are you a pig?

319
00:18:28,852 --> 00:18:31,352
- Does it make any difference?

320
00:18:33,764 --> 00:18:35,681
- I'm gonna enjoy this.

321
00:18:42,582 --> 00:18:43,731
- Cut him, Munch, cut him!

322
00:18:43,732 --> 00:18:44,874
(grunting)

323
00:18:44,875 --> 00:18:47,125
(thudding)

324
00:18:51,729 --> 00:18:53,729
- Come on, man, cut him!

325
00:18:56,518 --> 00:18:58,391
- Okay, now, everybody,
just hold it right there,

326
00:18:58,392 --> 00:19:00,059
hold it right there.

327
00:19:01,322 --> 00:19:02,905
Stay where you are.

328
00:19:06,814 --> 00:19:09,181
(motorcycle rumbling)

329
00:19:09,182 --> 00:19:12,432
(energetic rock music)

330
00:19:16,723 --> 00:19:18,012
- Ever shoot before?

331
00:19:18,013 --> 00:19:19,546
- No!

332
00:19:19,547 --> 00:19:21,212
- You might have to, honey.

333
00:19:21,213 --> 00:19:22,777
(motorcycle revving in distance)

334
00:19:22,778 --> 00:19:24,906
- Oh, no, they're back.

335
00:19:24,907 --> 00:19:26,277
- All right, let's get out of here.

336
00:19:26,278 --> 00:19:29,445
(motorcycle rumbling)

337
00:19:39,989 --> 00:19:40,822
- [Wade] Girls!

338
00:19:40,822 --> 00:19:41,782
- Is this what you're lookin' for?

339
00:19:41,783 --> 00:19:42,933
Don't move.

340
00:19:42,934 --> 00:19:43,982
Where are your friends?

341
00:19:43,983 --> 00:19:45,341
- Hey, I'm not one of them.

342
00:19:45,342 --> 00:19:47,188
I'm a police officer working undercover.

343
00:19:47,189 --> 00:19:49,026
- Sure you are.

344
00:19:49,027 --> 00:19:50,874
- Look, you guys gotta believe me.

345
00:19:50,875 --> 00:19:52,073
Those guys are gonna be
back here any second,

346
00:19:52,074 --> 00:19:53,363
then they'll kill us all.

347
00:19:53,364 --> 00:19:56,614
(motorcycles rumbling)

348
00:20:04,048 --> 00:20:07,048
(suspenseful music)

349
00:20:09,305 --> 00:20:13,472
(gun fires)
(groans)

350
00:20:14,516 --> 00:20:17,079
- Split up, back off, head for cover now!

351
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:20,080
(suspenseful music)

352
00:20:26,921 --> 00:20:28,921
- I still can't see 'em.

353
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:34,431
We're gonna have to get out of this place.

354
00:20:34,432 --> 00:20:37,391
I'm gonna hit as many as I can on the way.

355
00:20:37,392 --> 00:20:38,225
- Let's get out.
- Reaper!

356
00:20:38,225 --> 00:20:39,175
- I want you to shut up and listen!

357
00:20:39,176 --> 00:20:40,812
Pack all the money and then go around

358
00:20:40,813 --> 00:20:43,080
and take the keys outta all
the bikes and the thing.

359
00:20:43,081 --> 00:20:45,584
- But why?
- All the keys, get me?

360
00:20:45,585 --> 00:20:46,857
- But why?
- Wait at my bike.

361
00:20:46,858 --> 00:20:49,030
I'm gettin' outta here!

362
00:20:49,031 --> 00:20:50,616
- What about the gang?

363
00:20:50,617 --> 00:20:52,460
- Just do what I tell you to.

364
00:20:52,461 --> 00:20:54,038
- But they're your friends!

365
00:20:54,039 --> 00:20:56,402
- I don't have any friends.

366
00:20:56,403 --> 00:20:57,760
- What about me?

367
00:20:57,761 --> 00:20:59,577
- Yeah, sure, you're comin' with me,

368
00:20:59,578 --> 00:21:01,215
just do it fast!

369
00:21:01,216 --> 00:21:05,383
(tense music)
(guns firing)

370
00:21:10,358 --> 00:21:11,249
- [Man] Munch, watch out!

371
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:13,362
(gun fires)
(groaning)

372
00:21:13,363 --> 00:21:17,418
(guns firing)
(tense music)

373
00:21:17,419 --> 00:21:18,803
- Oh, my God!

374
00:21:18,804 --> 00:21:20,656
- [Wade] Steady now.

375
00:21:20,657 --> 00:21:23,136
(gun fires)
(woman screams)

376
00:21:23,137 --> 00:21:24,887
- Linda, you're okay!

377
00:21:27,596 --> 00:21:31,763
(guns firing)
(tense music)

378
00:21:34,897 --> 00:21:38,064
(motorcycle rumbling)

379
00:21:40,041 --> 00:21:41,041
- Skin!

380
00:21:42,796 --> 00:21:45,668
Come back here, you bitch!

381
00:21:45,669 --> 00:21:48,086
(gun firing)

382
00:21:49,022 --> 00:21:51,439
(gun firing)

383
00:21:53,666 --> 00:21:54,499
(grunts)

384
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:56,189
- Shit, no keys!

385
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:57,563
(guns firing)

386
00:21:57,564 --> 00:22:00,564
Hey, I'm gettin' outta here, Reaper!

387
00:22:01,979 --> 00:22:03,666
(gun fires)

388
00:22:03,667 --> 00:22:05,395
(gun clicking)

389
00:22:05,396 --> 00:22:07,896
(tense music)

390
00:22:12,361 --> 00:22:13,528
- Okay, buddy.

391
00:22:17,070 --> 00:22:19,087
You're under arrest.

392
00:22:19,088 --> 00:22:21,838
Let's get those hands in the air.

393
00:22:23,647 --> 00:22:25,408
You have the right...
- Shut the fuck up.

394
00:22:25,409 --> 00:22:27,830
She's gettin' away with
the money, let's get her!

395
00:22:27,831 --> 00:22:29,806
Half of it's yours.

396
00:22:29,807 --> 00:22:31,307
- And you lost it.

397
00:22:32,666 --> 00:22:36,249
Now you've got nothin'
and you are nothin'.

398
00:22:37,606 --> 00:22:39,922
- I'll just start all over again.

399
00:22:39,923 --> 00:22:43,090
Nothin' is the perfect place to start.

400
00:22:45,567 --> 00:22:48,880
- Reaper, what kinda name is that?

401
00:22:48,881 --> 00:22:52,118
- You know, Wyman, like death.

402
00:22:52,119 --> 00:22:53,952
The Reaper, like Grim.

403
00:22:54,822 --> 00:22:55,655
- That so?

404
00:22:55,656 --> 00:22:57,738
You the Grim Reaper, boy?

405
00:22:58,724 --> 00:23:00,481
- Killed his cellmate two days before

406
00:23:00,482 --> 00:23:03,883
the poor son-of-a-bitch got his parole.

407
00:23:03,884 --> 00:23:06,223
- Sounds like a fuckin' animal to me.

408
00:23:06,224 --> 00:23:07,733
Heard the guy had a
fortune hid on the outside.

409
00:23:07,734 --> 00:23:09,482
You hear about that, Reaper?

410
00:23:09,483 --> 00:23:11,751
- Hell, we could stop and
pick it up for you, Reaper.

411
00:23:11,752 --> 00:23:14,835
(policemen laughing)

412
00:23:19,297 --> 00:23:22,067
Bet you had some little
punk smoking your pipe,

413
00:23:22,068 --> 00:23:23,901
enjoying your company.

414
00:23:28,164 --> 00:23:29,226
(laughs)

415
00:23:29,227 --> 00:23:31,512
- County crew ahead.

416
00:23:31,513 --> 00:23:32,513
- Ah, shit.

417
00:23:34,016 --> 00:23:37,605
Probably workin' on
the damn highway again.

418
00:23:37,606 --> 00:23:41,439
(muffled speaking over radio)

419
00:23:42,422 --> 00:23:44,116
- Hey, boys, what's up?

420
00:23:44,117 --> 00:23:46,827
- Had a quake out here last night.

421
00:23:46,828 --> 00:23:48,058
The fault line runs
right under the highway

422
00:23:48,059 --> 00:23:49,327
up the road here.

423
00:23:49,328 --> 00:23:50,161
- Jesus!

424
00:23:50,162 --> 00:23:53,560
- Yeah, we got a six-inch crack
right through the blacktop.

425
00:23:53,561 --> 00:23:55,169
What you have to do is
take this side road here

426
00:23:55,170 --> 00:23:58,752
for about a mile and a
half, you'll be all right.

427
00:23:58,753 --> 00:24:00,648
- Thanks.
- Who you got back there?

428
00:24:00,649 --> 00:24:04,816
- [Policeman in Back Seat]
The Grim Reaper. (laughs)

429
00:24:16,106 --> 00:24:19,016
- You know those county sons
of bitches start at 27,000?

430
00:24:19,017 --> 00:24:20,549
- Ah, I wouldn't want their job.

431
00:24:20,550 --> 00:24:21,689
- Bullshit!

432
00:24:21,690 --> 00:24:22,863
All they do is fix shit.

433
00:24:22,864 --> 00:24:24,380
We get to catch and haul it around!

434
00:24:24,381 --> 00:24:27,043
(laughing)

435
00:24:27,044 --> 00:24:31,063
- He's talkin' about you, Reaper. (laughs)

436
00:24:31,064 --> 00:24:32,735
- Look at this.

437
00:24:32,736 --> 00:24:33,736
Jesus!

438
00:24:34,482 --> 00:24:36,982
(tense music)

439
00:24:40,453 --> 00:24:42,100
Shit, look at his leg.

440
00:24:42,101 --> 00:24:43,184
- Call it in.

441
00:24:44,327 --> 00:24:46,715
- This is transport unit 47 to base.

442
00:24:46,716 --> 00:24:48,722
(static crackling)

443
00:24:48,723 --> 00:24:51,191
Transport 47, come in, base.

444
00:24:51,192 --> 00:24:53,402
(tense music)

445
00:24:53,403 --> 00:24:56,895
I can't get through these hills.

446
00:24:56,896 --> 00:25:01,100
I think he's still alive,
I'm gonna check it out.

447
00:25:01,101 --> 00:25:02,768
- I don't like this.

448
00:25:04,181 --> 00:25:05,348
Don't like it.

449
00:25:07,089 --> 00:25:09,256
Shit, get back in the car!

450
00:25:10,097 --> 00:25:11,097
Wyman!

451
00:25:12,223 --> 00:25:13,223
Shit!

452
00:25:17,249 --> 00:25:19,537
Get back in the car, you idiot!

453
00:25:19,538 --> 00:25:22,229
(gun firing)

454
00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:24,308
- Son of a bitch!

455
00:25:24,309 --> 00:25:26,401
- Thanks for reviving me (mumbles).

456
00:25:26,402 --> 00:25:30,569
(gun fires)
(groaning)

457
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:34,718
(grunting)

458
00:25:34,719 --> 00:25:37,219
(tense music)

459
00:25:54,608 --> 00:25:56,976
(gun fires)

460
00:25:56,977 --> 00:26:00,569
(static crackling)

461
00:26:00,570 --> 00:26:03,070
(tense music)

462
00:26:06,834 --> 00:26:08,754
- Desert's been dead without you, man.

463
00:26:08,755 --> 00:26:11,255
(tense music)

464
00:26:21,878 --> 00:26:24,128
(laughing)

465
00:26:27,153 --> 00:26:28,976
- (speaking in Spanish) Reaper.

466
00:26:28,977 --> 00:26:30,614
Now we're even.

467
00:26:30,615 --> 00:26:33,115
(tense music)

468
00:26:34,987 --> 00:26:36,570
- Let him die, man.

469
00:26:38,041 --> 00:26:39,458
Let him die slow.

470
00:26:40,702 --> 00:26:41,702
- Don't!

471
00:26:44,535 --> 00:26:46,772
- What do you think I am?

472
00:26:46,773 --> 00:26:48,358
Some kind of animal?

473
00:26:48,359 --> 00:26:51,122
(panting)

474
00:26:51,123 --> 00:26:51,956
(gun fires)

475
00:26:51,957 --> 00:26:55,206
(dramatic tense music)

476
00:26:57,177 --> 00:27:00,344
(motorcycle rumbling)

477
00:27:15,412 --> 00:27:16,412
- Excuse me.

478
00:27:17,538 --> 00:27:18,975
Hey.

479
00:27:18,976 --> 00:27:20,559
It's a crime scene.

480
00:27:22,443 --> 00:27:23,610
Hey, dickhead!

481
00:27:24,677 --> 00:27:25,953
You can't be here, there's a police line

482
00:27:25,954 --> 00:27:27,787
around the whole area.

483
00:27:30,186 --> 00:27:32,292
- I don't see one.

484
00:27:32,293 --> 00:27:34,337
- Well, it's what you call figurative.

485
00:27:34,338 --> 00:27:38,505
I'm waiting for the evidence
team, you can't be here.

486
00:27:42,576 --> 00:27:45,076
You can't be here, understand?

487
00:27:47,282 --> 00:27:49,699
- Hey, relax, man, I'm a cop.

488
00:27:50,731 --> 00:27:52,052
- It doesn't matter if you are.

489
00:27:52,053 --> 00:27:55,303
You're not local and you can't be here.

490
00:28:02,486 --> 00:28:04,069
The hell you doing?

491
00:28:07,430 --> 00:28:10,430
- It's not blood, theatrical makeup.

492
00:28:14,261 --> 00:28:15,844
- Hey, who are you?

493
00:28:17,449 --> 00:28:20,522
How'd you find out about this?

494
00:28:20,523 --> 00:28:21,856
Where you going?

495
00:28:22,767 --> 00:28:24,253
- I got a date with the devil.

496
00:28:24,254 --> 00:28:28,059
(motorcycle rumbling)

497
00:28:28,060 --> 00:28:30,977

(tattoo machine buzzing)
- That's the way it goes.

519
00:30:38,448 --> 00:30:41,262
(mumbles)
- [Tattoo Artist] Sit still.

520
00:30:41,263 --> 00:30:43,944
- I was at my sister's
wedding in Santa Barbara

521
00:30:43,945 --> 00:30:47,478
and I met this really cute chick.

522
00:30:47,479 --> 00:30:48,646
We hit it off.

523
00:30:49,583 --> 00:30:51,368
You know, and I was thinking...

524
00:30:51,369 --> 00:30:53,364
- Come on, seriously, sit still.

525
00:30:53,365 --> 00:30:55,772
- I was thinking, you know,

526
00:30:55,773 --> 00:30:59,454
there's a chick, man, that I
could spend some time with.

527
00:30:59,455 --> 00:31:01,627
You know, if my old lady wouldn't mind it.

528
00:31:01,628 --> 00:31:04,585
This chick was beautiful,
man, we hit it off.

529
00:31:04,586 --> 00:31:08,679
Next thing I know, she starts
talking about givin' me head,

530
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:10,529
and I said, "Hey, listen,

531
00:31:10,530 --> 00:31:13,327
"just climb on the old chorizo, huh?"

532
00:31:13,328 --> 00:31:17,059
You know, it could have been
a really great relationship,

533
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:20,972
somethin' I coulda really liked goin' for.

534
00:31:20,973 --> 00:31:23,116
(groaning)

535
00:31:23,117 --> 00:31:24,705
You're fuckin' me up, man!

536
00:31:24,706 --> 00:31:25,821

00:31:27,581 --> 00:31:28,843
- Hey, Harlan.

539
00:31:28,844 --> 00:31:29,677
How you doin', Harlan?

540
00:31:29,678 --> 00:31:31,386
I'm gonna ask you a few
questions, all right?

541
00:31:31,387 --> 00:31:32,706
Huh?
- Man, all right!

542
00:31:32,707 --> 00:31:34,090
- Is it all right if I ask
you a couple of questions?

543
00:31:34,091 --> 00:31:36,173
- Yes, man!
- Where's Reaper at?

544
00:31:36,174 --> 00:31:37,007
- Reaper who?

545
00:31:37,008 --> 00:31:39,289
- You know, Reaper, Harlan, Reaper!

546
00:31:39,290 --> 00:31:41,831
- Okay, man, I saw him in
San Quentin two weeks ago.

547
00:31:41,832 --> 00:31:43,350
- San Quentin, huh?

548
00:31:43,351 --> 00:31:44,184
(tattoo machine buzzing)

549
00:31:44,185 --> 00:31:45,652
- All right, all right!
- Where's Reaper?

550
00:31:45,653 --> 00:31:46,694
(tattoo machine buzzing)
(screaming)

551
00:31:46,695 --> 00:31:48,964
- Okay, man, I saw him just yesterday!

552
00:31:48,965 --> 00:31:49,951
Jesus!

553
00:31:49,952 --> 00:31:51,470
I saw him yesterday!

554
00:31:51,471 --> 00:31:53,323
- Where was he?

555
00:31:53,324 --> 00:31:54,324
Where?

556
00:31:55,209 --> 00:31:58,452
- Hey, man, do I look like
a crystal ball or somethin'?

557
00:31:58,453 --> 00:32:01,084
(tattoo machine buzzing)
(screaming)

558
00:32:01,085 --> 00:32:02,681
Fuck, man!

559
00:32:02,682 --> 00:32:03,817
- Where's Reaper?

560
00:32:03,818 --> 00:32:06,320
- [Harlan] He went back,
he's in the desert somewhere.

561
00:32:06,321 --> 00:32:08,086
- Where in the desert,
where in the desert?

562
00:32:08,087 --> 00:32:09,087
- Oh, man,

563
00:32:10,352 --> 00:32:11,756
you're fuckin' me up!

564
00:32:11,757 --> 00:32:13,706
- [Wade] Where in the desert?

565
00:32:13,707 --> 00:32:16,571
(groaning)

566
00:32:16,572 --> 00:32:20,739
- I think the first stop
was gonna be (mumbles).

567
00:32:21,667 --> 00:32:24,693
I swear to God, I don't
know anything else.

568
00:32:24,694 --> 00:32:27,809
I don't have a loyalty
to that son of a bitch.

569
00:32:27,810 --> 00:32:29,977
I got a wife and kids too.

570
00:32:31,530 --> 00:32:33,697
I got a job, got a studio.

571
00:32:38,305 --> 00:32:41,805
- You're a special effects
makeup artist, aren't ya?

572
00:32:41,806 --> 00:32:43,516
- Yeah, man, how did you know?

573
00:32:43,517 --> 00:32:46,198
- 'Cause you're dirty in
this Reaper thing, man,

574
00:32:46,199 --> 00:32:49,286
and they're checking your
prints at the station right now.

575
00:32:49,287 --> 00:32:53,454
(groaning)
(tense music)

576
00:33:02,083 --> 00:33:03,333
- Motherfucker!

577
00:33:05,455 --> 00:33:08,622
(speaking in Spanish)

578
00:33:19,292 --> 00:33:21,552
- Hey, I'm riding back to town.

579
00:33:21,553 --> 00:33:22,536
- Why?

580
00:33:22,537 --> 00:33:25,178
- Come on, Reaper, this is bullshit.

581
00:33:25,179 --> 00:33:26,736
We've already ridden over 100 miles,

582
00:33:26,737 --> 00:33:28,471
you haven't told us where we're going.

583
00:33:28,472 --> 00:33:31,305
Hey, life isn't like this anymore.

584
00:33:33,169 --> 00:33:35,285
- What about loyalty?

585
00:33:35,286 --> 00:33:36,755
- Fuck loyalty!

586
00:33:36,756 --> 00:33:38,764
I got a job startin' tomorrow.

587
00:33:38,765 --> 00:33:41,034
I think I speak for us...
- Hey!

588
00:33:41,035 --> 00:33:43,555
Speak for yourself, asshole!

589
00:33:43,556 --> 00:33:45,125
- Yeah!

590
00:33:45,126 --> 00:33:47,937
Leave me the fuck outta your shit too.

591
00:33:47,938 --> 00:33:49,814
- Yeah, no shit.

592
00:33:49,815 --> 00:33:53,148
- You know what's wrong with you, Munch?

593
00:33:53,985 --> 00:33:55,235
You're gutless.

594
00:33:57,135 --> 00:34:01,302
(groaning)
(tense music)

595
00:34:08,762 --> 00:34:11,276
Like I said, gutless.

596
00:34:11,277 --> 00:34:14,378
(tense music)

597
00:34:14,379 --> 00:34:17,074
Tomorrow, we leave for the Hopi Mountains.

598
00:34:17,075 --> 00:34:18,575
- Hopis, what for?

599
00:34:19,479 --> 00:34:22,244
- The Hopis were spiritual visionaries.

600
00:34:22,245 --> 00:34:26,322
The Indian soil holds
the key to our future.

601
00:34:26,323 --> 00:34:27,656
We ride at dawn.

602
00:34:30,927 --> 00:34:31,927
- Far out.

603
00:34:33,509 --> 00:34:36,109
- Hey, why don't you
leave this to the force?

604
00:34:36,110 --> 00:34:38,081
They'll take care of it.

605
00:34:38,082 --> 00:34:41,913
- As long as Reaper's
involved, it's my business.

606
00:34:41,914 --> 00:34:45,016
- Well, the best defense
is a good offense.

607
00:34:45,017 --> 00:34:47,869
Try these, I made them for you.

608
00:34:47,870 --> 00:34:49,215
- [Wade] I already got shoes.

609
00:34:49,216 --> 00:34:50,773
- Not like these.

610
00:34:50,774 --> 00:34:54,357
Simply put your foot
down, right heel, see?

611
00:34:57,603 --> 00:35:01,515
You've heard of steel-tipped
shoes, haven't you?

612
00:35:01,516 --> 00:35:02,776
Here!

613
00:35:02,777 --> 00:35:04,709
Now, this is a very special gun.

614
00:35:04,710 --> 00:35:07,652
When the safety is on, it fires normally,

615
00:35:07,653 --> 00:35:12,010
but when the safety is
off, it fires backwards,

616
00:35:12,011 --> 00:35:16,178
straight at whoever pulls
the trigger. (chuckles)

617
00:35:17,835 --> 00:35:19,356
Here.

618
00:35:19,357 --> 00:35:22,440
These will come in handy, explosives.

619
00:35:23,432 --> 00:35:24,783
- How do they work?

620
00:35:24,784 --> 00:35:28,004
- Well, you need this to go along with it.

621
00:35:28,005 --> 00:35:29,431
There's a little button here.

622
00:35:29,432 --> 00:35:31,777
It accesses a detonator.

623
00:35:31,778 --> 00:35:33,695
It's good for 300 feet.

624
00:35:37,313 --> 00:35:38,703
- Hey, thanks, Rog.

625
00:35:38,704 --> 00:35:40,950
This stuff ought to do me a lot of good.

626
00:35:40,951 --> 00:35:42,860
Thanks a lot, buddy.

627
00:35:42,861 --> 00:35:44,777
(Rog chuckles)

628
00:35:44,778 --> 00:35:47,278
(tense music)

629
00:35:51,338 --> 00:35:53,961
- Times are changing, Reaper.

630
00:35:53,962 --> 00:35:57,344
You know, half the bikers are married,

631
00:35:57,345 --> 00:35:58,345
got kids.

632
00:35:59,990 --> 00:36:03,240
Ridin' free's a thing of the past, man.

633
00:36:04,651 --> 00:36:05,818
- Here, maybe.

634
00:36:06,707 --> 00:36:09,399
America is lost to three-piece suits,

635
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:13,217
air surveillance at 55 miles an hour.

636
00:36:13,218 --> 00:36:14,301
- Where then?

637
00:36:15,156 --> 00:36:17,906
Seems like there's no place left.

638
00:36:20,468 --> 00:36:23,968
- Imagine a city of our own, a biker city,

639
00:36:25,489 --> 00:36:29,656
with me as king, and no laws
except the laws of nature.

640
00:36:31,296 --> 00:36:34,095
- Yeah, none of them
wannabe righteous pigs.

641
00:36:34,096 --> 00:36:36,834
- No helmets and all the drugs you want.

642
00:36:36,835 --> 00:36:39,341
(mumbling)

643
00:36:39,342 --> 00:36:40,878
- I can dig it.

644
00:36:40,879 --> 00:36:42,629
- Justice for bikers.

645
00:36:43,765 --> 00:36:45,682
- A city built on gold.

646
00:36:46,555 --> 00:36:49,055
(tense music)

647
00:36:52,312 --> 00:36:53,556
(screeching)

648
00:36:53,557 --> 00:36:56,686
♫ Hey, it's comin' to you, summer storm

649
00:36:56,687 --> 00:37:00,222
♫ We'll be on and it's far too long

650
00:37:00,223 --> 00:37:03,848
♫ Heaven's laid on the line and such

651
00:37:03,849 --> 00:37:06,632
♫ So now, honey, wanna love you much

652
00:37:06,633 --> 00:37:09,300
♫ Come on, love

653
00:37:12,947 --> 00:37:16,127
♫ Come on, love me, ooh

654
00:37:16,128 --> 00:37:17,878
- Give me a red beer.

655
00:37:21,067 --> 00:37:25,234
(music drowned out by chattering)

656
00:37:26,923 --> 00:37:30,455
♫ Show me what you can do

657
00:37:30,456 --> 00:37:32,967
I'm lookin' for Reaper.

658
00:37:32,968 --> 00:37:35,218
(laughing)

659
00:37:37,097 --> 00:37:38,120
- Hey!

660
00:37:38,121 --> 00:37:39,762
This guy's lookin' for Reaper!

661
00:37:39,763 --> 00:37:42,013
(laughing)

662
00:37:43,908 --> 00:37:45,991
You ride with the Reaper?

663
00:37:47,016 --> 00:37:48,723
- Maybe I do.

664
00:37:48,724 --> 00:37:51,958
- (laughs) He ain't too
popular around here.

665
00:37:51,959 --> 00:37:54,292
He burned us once too often.

666
00:37:55,453 --> 00:37:57,786
- Now, how could he do that?

667
00:37:59,449 --> 00:38:02,116
- Hey, you fuckin' with us, man?

668
00:38:03,687 --> 00:38:05,085
- Tell me where Reaper is!

669
00:38:05,086 --> 00:38:07,923
(thudding)

670
00:38:07,924 --> 00:38:09,435
(groaning)

671
00:38:09,436 --> 00:38:11,686
(punching)

672
00:38:13,409 --> 00:38:16,326
(glass shattering)

673
00:38:19,871 --> 00:38:24,038
(hissing)
(man screaming)

674
00:38:29,868 --> 00:38:32,368
You tell Reaper I'm on my way.

675
00:38:33,526 --> 00:38:34,609
- No problem.

676
00:38:36,526 --> 00:38:39,776
(motorcycles rumbling)

677
00:39:17,491 --> 00:39:20,824
- Why don't you invite your friends out?

678
00:39:41,597 --> 00:39:44,784
Relax, we're all on the same side here.

679
00:39:44,785 --> 00:39:46,218
- What side's that?

680
00:39:46,219 --> 00:39:47,386
- The outside.

681
00:39:48,682 --> 00:39:51,160
- Grayden, that's the Reaper, man.

682
00:39:51,161 --> 00:39:52,474
- What's a Reaper?

683
00:39:52,475 --> 00:39:54,558
- He used to be bad news.

684
00:39:55,890 --> 00:39:57,288
- You know a biker named Cat Fish?

685
00:39:57,289 --> 00:39:59,782
He's somewhere between here and Hopi land.

686
00:39:59,783 --> 00:40:01,467
- We all know Cat Fish, man.

687
00:40:01,468 --> 00:40:03,109
He was through here about a week ago.

688
00:40:03,110 --> 00:40:03,943
(grunting)
(thudding)

689
00:40:03,944 --> 00:40:07,484
- I told ya, I do the talkin' here!

690
00:40:07,485 --> 00:40:09,151
- This mean anything to you?

691
00:40:09,152 --> 00:40:12,485
- Nothin', what do you want from us?

692
00:40:12,486 --> 00:40:14,001
- I'm lookin' for a fortune,

693
00:40:14,002 --> 00:40:17,146
and Cat Fish can help me find it.

694
00:40:17,147 --> 00:40:18,647
Anyone want a cut?

695
00:40:19,937 --> 00:40:22,012
- We got everything we need here.

696
00:40:22,013 --> 00:40:24,680
We don't need you or your money.

697
00:40:26,193 --> 00:40:28,408
- Well, you've got high ideals,

698
00:40:28,409 --> 00:40:30,168
and a lot of balls.

699
00:40:30,169 --> 00:40:31,572
- Might makes right.

700
00:40:31,573 --> 00:40:35,107
Why don't you just ride the
fuck outta here, Reaper?

701
00:40:35,108 --> 00:40:36,547
- That your final word?

702
00:40:36,548 --> 00:40:39,111
(tense music)

703
00:40:39,112 --> 00:40:40,919
(spits)
(gun fires)

704
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:43,420
(tense music)

705
00:40:44,487 --> 00:40:46,904
(gun clicks)

706
00:40:52,371 --> 00:40:54,454
So much for havin' balls.

707
00:40:56,659 --> 00:40:58,617
We can all die here right now,

708
00:40:58,618 --> 00:41:01,214
or you can ride with me and get rich.

709
00:41:01,215 --> 00:41:02,736
The man who finds Cat Fish first

710
00:41:02,737 --> 00:41:04,749
will be able to finance his own army.

711
00:41:04,750 --> 00:41:07,250
(tense music)

712
00:41:20,341 --> 00:41:23,416
I thought you'd see it my way.

713
00:41:23,417 --> 00:41:24,443
Let's ride.

714
00:41:24,444 --> 00:41:27,694
(motorcycles rumbling)

715
00:41:37,922 --> 00:41:40,422
(tense music)

716
00:42:15,378 --> 00:42:16,861
(mystical music)

717
00:42:16,862 --> 00:42:17,945
- Rain Maker!

718
00:42:22,697 --> 00:42:25,447
(mystical music)

719
00:42:28,679 --> 00:42:30,941
So, how'd you find me?

720
00:42:30,942 --> 00:42:32,976
- Your energy's strong.

721
00:42:32,977 --> 00:42:34,144
Easy to track.

722
00:42:35,119 --> 00:42:36,643
- What brings you out here?

723
00:42:36,644 --> 00:42:38,232
- Lookin' for work.

724
00:42:38,233 --> 00:42:41,601
My reputation isn't what it used to be.

725
00:42:41,602 --> 00:42:44,100
- [Wade] What's the
matter, losing your touch?

726
00:42:44,101 --> 00:42:46,553
- The sky is different now.

727
00:42:46,554 --> 00:42:48,893
Yeah, it's full of pollution,

728
00:42:48,894 --> 00:42:50,394
even way out here.

729
00:42:51,552 --> 00:42:55,515
And little pieces of it are gone forever.

730
00:42:55,516 --> 00:42:57,351
You know, rain makin' is like

731
00:42:57,352 --> 00:43:00,435
fightin' chemical warfare these days.

732
00:43:02,345 --> 00:43:06,246
You know there's black sky all around you?

733
00:43:06,247 --> 00:43:08,136
- Yeah, I know.

734
00:43:08,137 --> 00:43:11,611
I'm gonna try and blow that sky away.

735
00:43:11,612 --> 00:43:13,112
- The Reaper, huh?

736
00:43:14,890 --> 00:43:18,041
When I first met you two years
ago, you were pissed off,

737
00:43:18,042 --> 00:43:20,259
but your soul was clear.

738
00:43:20,260 --> 00:43:22,260
Now it's dark with fury.

739
00:43:24,268 --> 00:43:27,751
- You sound like a fortune cookie.

740
00:43:27,752 --> 00:43:31,335
- Just readin' your
cards, son, that's all.

741
00:43:32,461 --> 00:43:34,636
- We got a lot of ridin' to do.

742
00:43:34,637 --> 00:43:38,804
(motorcycles rumbling)
(soft pensive music)

743
00:43:46,728 --> 00:43:49,145
(chattering)

744
00:44:05,705 --> 00:44:09,756
♫ Fallin' off the swing,
slippin' on the slide

745
00:44:09,757 --> 00:44:13,725
♫ Tryin' everything to find a better ride

746
00:44:13,726 --> 00:44:17,920
♫ Then you count to 50 and you kick my can

747
00:44:17,921 --> 00:44:22,088
♫ Playin' hide and seek
until you find your man

748
00:44:24,737 --> 00:44:26,154
Hey, rising star.

749
00:44:28,245 --> 00:44:29,085
You don't happen to know a guy

750
00:44:29,086 --> 00:44:31,585
by the name of Reaper, do you?

751
00:44:33,251 --> 00:44:34,084
- Maybe.

752
00:44:34,085 --> 00:44:37,488
(energetic music)

753
00:44:37,489 --> 00:44:39,406
Check out Vito Pardito.

754
00:44:41,494 --> 00:44:44,161
(pensive music)

755
00:45:00,469 --> 00:45:02,636
- This can't be all of it.

756
00:45:13,399 --> 00:45:15,325
- What's the next move, Reaper?

757
00:45:15,326 --> 00:45:17,156
- I wanna find Cat Fish.

758
00:45:17,157 --> 00:45:19,317
Take two men and comb the hills.

759
00:45:19,318 --> 00:45:21,985
(pensive music)

760
00:45:27,848 --> 00:45:31,098
(motorcycles rumbling)

761
00:45:53,307 --> 00:45:55,890
(man groaning)

762
00:45:57,646 --> 00:45:59,885
(mumbling)

763
00:45:59,886 --> 00:46:01,982
- [Grayden] Help me, Reaper shot me.

764
00:46:01,983 --> 00:46:03,733
- Okay there, let me.

765
00:46:06,628 --> 00:46:08,337
- The pain, it hurts.

766
00:46:08,338 --> 00:46:09,588
Reaper shot me.

767
00:46:11,139 --> 00:46:13,012
- Quiet now, son.

768
00:46:13,013 --> 00:46:15,563
Now, breathe deeply with me, come on.

769
00:46:15,564 --> 00:46:18,481
(breathing deeply)

770
00:46:24,215 --> 00:46:25,490
Pain is goin' away.

771
00:46:25,491 --> 00:46:26,491
- Yes.

772
00:46:27,420 --> 00:46:28,884
- Where'd Reaper go?

773
00:46:28,885 --> 00:46:30,218
- South, Ciudad.

774
00:46:31,486 --> 00:46:33,622
(mumbles)

775
00:46:33,623 --> 00:46:37,790
Took a bunch of my skins,
promised 'em big money. (coughing)

776
00:46:44,223 --> 00:46:46,723
(tense music)

777
00:46:53,809 --> 00:46:56,142
- [Rain Maker] You rest now.

778
00:46:57,361 --> 00:47:00,111
(mystical music)

779
00:47:03,428 --> 00:47:05,346
(upbeat rock music)

780
00:47:05,347 --> 00:47:06,761
- It's hot!

781
00:47:06,762 --> 00:47:09,630
Okay, come on now,
girls, girls, girls, sex.

782
00:47:09,631 --> 00:47:11,415
Come on, Angie, give me a little sex.

783
00:47:11,416 --> 00:47:13,304
Nice, Brigette, great.

784
00:47:13,305 --> 00:47:14,609
Great.

785
00:47:14,610 --> 00:47:18,095
That's it, Angie, you're gettin' there.

786
00:47:18,096 --> 00:47:19,660
Sex, both of you.

787
00:47:19,661 --> 00:47:20,924
(mumbling)

788
00:47:20,925 --> 00:47:22,574
Great.

789
00:47:22,575 --> 00:47:26,742
(motorcycle rumbling)
(hooting)

790
00:47:28,190 --> 00:47:32,357
- Look out, gonna have
some fun today. (laughs)

791
00:47:33,654 --> 00:47:35,430
(hooting) Get a load of this.

792
00:47:35,431 --> 00:47:39,598
- Hey, come on, guys, we're
trying to get a job done.

793
00:47:41,966 --> 00:47:44,929
(motorcyclist laughing)

794
00:47:44,930 --> 00:47:47,560
You know what work is, don't you?

795
00:47:47,561 --> 00:47:49,334
You've heard of the word, haven't you?

796
00:47:49,335 --> 00:47:50,168
Work.

797
00:47:50,169 --> 00:47:51,636
(laughing)

798
00:47:51,637 --> 00:47:53,580
- Those people are gonna need some help.

799
00:47:53,581 --> 00:47:55,219
- [Motorcyclist] Do we look like we work?

800
00:47:55,220 --> 00:47:58,850
- Why don't you assholes hit the road?

801
00:47:58,851 --> 00:48:00,895
Come on, we're trying to focus.

802
00:48:00,896 --> 00:48:03,530
(laughing)
(tense music)

803
00:48:03,531 --> 00:48:04,464
- Focus on this.

804
00:48:04,465 --> 00:48:06,503
(gun fires)
(women gasping)

805
00:48:06,504 --> 00:48:09,416
(laughing)

806
00:48:09,417 --> 00:48:10,813
Come on.
(women gasping)

807
00:48:10,814 --> 00:48:11,647
- Get a load of this.

808
00:48:11,648 --> 00:48:13,199
- So, who wants to be first, huh?

809
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:15,730
Who wants to grease (mumbles)?

810
00:48:15,731 --> 00:48:19,460
(laughs) How 'bout you, babe?

811
00:48:19,461 --> 00:48:22,303
Bet you'd be the sweetest
thing I ever tasted, huh?

812
00:48:22,304 --> 00:48:25,478
(laughs) How 'bout a kiss?

813
00:48:25,479 --> 00:48:26,636
(slapping)

814
00:48:26,637 --> 00:48:28,022
I said kiss me, bitch.

815
00:48:28,023 --> 00:48:29,555
Kiss me, bitch!

816
00:48:29,556 --> 00:48:30,520
- Hey!

817
00:48:30,521 --> 00:48:33,703
(tense music)

818
00:48:33,704 --> 00:48:36,281
- Hey, why don't you
back off, motherfucker,

819
00:48:36,282 --> 00:48:38,289
or the girls are history.

820
00:48:38,290 --> 00:48:39,933
- I brought you boys something.

821
00:48:39,934 --> 00:48:41,004
Happy Fourth of July!

822
00:48:41,005 --> 00:48:42,912
- Hey, cat, that's dynamite!

823
00:48:42,913 --> 00:48:43,913
Come on!

824
00:48:44,827 --> 00:48:45,906
- What are you doing, man?

825
00:48:45,907 --> 00:48:47,105
- Piece of cake.

826
00:48:47,106 --> 00:48:50,273
(motorcycle rumbling)

827
00:48:52,297 --> 00:48:53,297
Ah.

828
00:48:54,696 --> 00:48:58,317
Damn, I hate to waste a
whole frigging road flare.

829
00:48:58,318 --> 00:49:00,818
(tense music)

830
00:49:02,619 --> 00:49:05,786
(motorcycle rumbling)

831
00:49:17,770 --> 00:49:20,353
- Oh, Reaper, am I glad to see you.

832
00:49:20,354 --> 00:49:21,622
Ran into some trouble.

833
00:49:21,623 --> 00:49:23,034
- What kinda trouble?

834
00:49:23,035 --> 00:49:25,118
- Some big blond asshole.

835
00:49:26,858 --> 00:49:28,383
- Olson.

836
00:49:28,384 --> 00:49:29,299
Was he alone?

837
00:49:29,300 --> 00:49:32,391
- He had that Rain Maker freak with him.

838
00:49:32,392 --> 00:49:33,322
- Did he follow you?

839
00:49:33,323 --> 00:49:35,289
- No, Reaper, I swear to God.

840
00:49:35,290 --> 00:49:38,069
Hey, come on, look, I swear to God.

841
00:49:38,070 --> 00:49:40,320
(grunting)

842
00:49:41,445 --> 00:49:43,041
- Pounder, take a couple of men,

843
00:49:43,042 --> 00:49:45,963
find Olson and the white
hair and stop 'em, dead.

844
00:49:45,964 --> 00:49:49,797
- Yeah, you got it. (mumbles)

845
00:49:54,220 --> 00:49:57,470
(motorcycles rumbling)

846
00:50:03,003 --> 00:50:06,753
(suspenseful mystical music)

847
00:50:39,516 --> 00:50:42,016
(tense music)

848
00:50:47,054 --> 00:50:49,471
(gun firing)

849
00:50:51,053 --> 00:50:52,305
- (mumbles) Reaper knows we're coming!

850
00:50:52,306 --> 00:50:56,473
(guns firing)
(tense music)

851
00:51:18,363 --> 00:51:20,613
(groaning)

852
00:51:29,426 --> 00:51:31,676
(grunting)

853
00:51:34,325 --> 00:51:38,223
Okay, son, I'm gonna
ask you a few questions.

854
00:51:38,224 --> 00:51:40,374
Tell me the truth and you're outta here.

855
00:51:40,375 --> 00:51:43,282
You lie to me and you stay
here forever, you got it?

856
00:51:43,283 --> 00:51:44,524
Where's Reaper?

857
00:51:44,525 --> 00:51:45,825
- He's south of the border.

858
00:51:45,826 --> 00:51:46,659
- Where?

859
00:51:46,660 --> 00:51:49,921
- Down in Mexico. (panting)

860
00:51:49,922 --> 00:51:50,755
- Where?
- I don't know!

861
00:51:50,756 --> 00:51:51,819
- What's he doing down there?

862
00:51:51,820 --> 00:51:54,789
- I don't know, man. (panting)

863
00:51:54,790 --> 00:51:55,790
- Come on!

864
00:51:57,744 --> 00:52:00,770
- Dude, he's got 100 men with him.

865
00:52:00,771 --> 00:52:03,201
I don't know, that's all
I know, he went south.

866
00:52:03,202 --> 00:52:04,702
That's all I know.

867
00:52:06,785 --> 00:52:08,202
- All right, man.

868
00:52:12,036 --> 00:52:13,286
Get outta here!

869
00:52:19,227 --> 00:52:21,130
- Hey, dickhead,

870
00:52:21,131 --> 00:52:24,298
you wouldn't find Reaper in 100 years!

871
00:52:26,037 --> 00:52:27,843
- Hey, why'd you let him go?

872
00:52:27,844 --> 00:52:31,311
- We're coming back for you
and kick your fuckin' ass,

873
00:52:31,312 --> 00:52:32,729
and I'm with 'em!

874
00:52:33,695 --> 00:52:36,028
- Liar, liar, pants on fire.

875
00:52:36,941 --> 00:52:37,824
(beeping)
(loud blasting)

876
00:52:37,825 --> 00:52:41,991
(groaning)
(flames crackling)

877
00:52:44,761 --> 00:52:47,412
- He said Reaper is south?

878
00:52:47,413 --> 00:52:48,998
- We ride north.

879
00:52:48,999 --> 00:52:52,249
(motorcycles rumbling)

880
00:53:17,336 --> 00:53:19,753
(chattering)

881
00:53:38,210 --> 00:53:40,210
- Here's Cat Fish, boss.

882
00:53:43,661 --> 00:53:44,661
- Find it?

883
00:53:48,299 --> 00:53:51,382
Well, I'll be a son of a bitch, Skin.

884
00:53:52,253 --> 00:53:55,078
- Reaper, look, don't be pissed off, okay?

885
00:53:55,079 --> 00:53:56,800
The money I took, I invested it.

886
00:53:56,801 --> 00:53:59,139
I screwed up, you know?
- Who cares?

887
00:53:59,140 --> 00:54:01,252
It was only 30 grand.

888
00:54:01,253 --> 00:54:04,586
After tomorrow, that'll be small change.

889
00:54:06,850 --> 00:54:09,263
I thought you were goin' straight.

890
00:54:09,264 --> 00:54:12,327
What are you doin' ridin' with
a piece of shit like this?

891
00:54:12,328 --> 00:54:14,409
- He's a nice guy.

892
00:54:14,410 --> 00:54:15,922
- I wasn't talkin' to you.

893
00:54:15,923 --> 00:54:17,996
(motorcyclists laughing)

894
00:54:17,997 --> 00:54:19,636
Search him, Tester.

895
00:54:19,637 --> 00:54:21,273
Strip search this one.

896
00:54:21,274 --> 00:54:23,124
- [Tester] I was hoping you'd say that.

897
00:54:23,125 --> 00:54:24,937
- What do you want, Reaper?

898
00:54:24,938 --> 00:54:27,605
- I'm your new business partner.

899
00:54:42,916 --> 00:54:46,166
(motorcycles rumbling)

900
00:54:48,766 --> 00:54:52,016
(whip cracking loudly)

901
00:54:58,224 --> 00:54:59,297
(gasping)

902
00:54:59,298 --> 00:55:01,987
I know you're lying to me, Cat Fish.

903
00:55:01,988 --> 00:55:03,918
- You don't know shit.

904
00:55:03,919 --> 00:55:06,342
- I know more than you think.

905
00:55:06,343 --> 00:55:08,426
I was Hangman's cellmate.

906
00:55:12,913 --> 00:55:14,142
I know you were gonna meet him here

907
00:55:14,143 --> 00:55:16,284
two days after his parole.

908
00:55:16,285 --> 00:55:18,071
(whip cracking loudly)

909
00:55:18,072 --> 00:55:19,708
That's today, asshole.

910
00:55:19,709 --> 00:55:21,480
(whip cracking loudly)

911
00:55:21,481 --> 00:55:23,924
I know you have the other part of the map.

912
00:55:23,925 --> 00:55:25,679
(whip cracking loudly)

913
00:55:25,680 --> 00:55:28,067
I know you think I won't really kill you.

914
00:55:28,068 --> 00:55:31,318
(whip cracking loudly)

915
00:55:34,497 --> 00:55:36,104
- Fuck off!

916
00:55:36,105 --> 00:55:37,720
(laughing)

917
00:55:37,721 --> 00:55:38,695
(whip cracking loudly)

918
00:55:38,696 --> 00:55:40,713
(panting)

919
00:55:40,714 --> 00:55:41,837
(whip cracking loudly)

920
00:55:41,838 --> 00:55:43,913
- Reaper, stop!

921
00:55:43,914 --> 00:55:45,449
(whip cracking loudly)

922
00:55:45,450 --> 00:55:46,283
Stop!

923
00:55:46,284 --> 00:55:49,387
(whip cracking loudly)

924
00:55:49,388 --> 00:55:51,721
I'll give you the map, stop!

925
00:55:53,425 --> 00:55:54,592
- Skin, don't!

926
00:56:01,872 --> 00:56:04,539
- Promise me you won't hurt him.

927
00:56:05,647 --> 00:56:06,647
- No!

928
00:56:19,696 --> 00:56:21,036
- [Skin] Okay?

929
00:56:21,037 --> 00:56:22,037
- Of course.

930
00:56:34,215 --> 00:56:37,128
(grunting)

931
00:56:37,129 --> 00:56:39,464
- Cat Fish, look at me.

932
00:56:39,465 --> 00:56:40,298
Are you okay?

933
00:56:40,299 --> 00:56:41,668
- Get away from me!

934
00:56:41,669 --> 00:56:44,716
- Cat Fish, I just saved your life.

935
00:56:44,717 --> 00:56:46,157
- You sold me out!

936
00:56:46,158 --> 00:56:48,750
(grunting)

937
00:56:48,751 --> 00:56:50,168
- What do you want to do with the bitch?

938
00:56:50,169 --> 00:56:52,810
- Reaper, Reaper, you said
you wouldn't hurt him!

939
00:56:52,811 --> 00:56:53,978
- And I won't.

940
00:56:59,643 --> 00:57:01,130
- Bastard!

941
00:57:01,131 --> 00:57:02,381
Son of a bitch!

942
00:57:03,453 --> 00:57:05,667
Let me down, let me down!

943
00:57:05,668 --> 00:57:07,205
- Shut her up.

944
00:57:07,206 --> 00:57:08,521
- Let me down, you piece of shit!

945
00:57:08,522 --> 00:57:11,355
(slapping loudly)

946
00:57:12,319 --> 00:57:15,819
- Come on, Cat Fish, I'll buy you a drink.

947
00:57:24,049 --> 00:57:27,187
- We better split up tomorrow.

948
00:57:27,188 --> 00:57:30,536
We're near an old abandoned
Navajo reservation.

949
00:57:30,537 --> 00:57:33,998
Reaper could be anywhere around here.

950
00:57:33,999 --> 00:57:36,888
- Wade, I meant what I said before

951
00:57:36,889 --> 00:57:39,937
about the blackness in your heart.

952
00:57:39,938 --> 00:57:41,693
You know, the more hate you give,

953
00:57:41,694 --> 00:57:43,848
the more you have to get.

954
00:57:43,849 --> 00:57:46,297
- That sounds like a warning.

955
00:57:46,298 --> 00:57:49,469
- Listen, the more hatred
you direct at Reaper,

956
00:57:49,470 --> 00:57:51,774
the more hatred will come into your life.

957
00:57:51,775 --> 00:57:54,275
(tense music)

958
00:57:56,505 --> 00:57:58,922
(chattering)

959
00:58:21,126 --> 00:58:25,209
- Reaper, they never came
back, Pounder and them.

960
00:58:26,119 --> 00:58:27,119
- Mm.

961
00:58:28,067 --> 00:58:30,183
That's all right.

962
00:58:30,184 --> 00:58:31,891
Least they'll slow 'em down.

963
00:58:31,892 --> 00:58:34,392
(tense music)

964
00:58:41,899 --> 00:58:44,566
(pensive music)

965
00:59:26,482 --> 00:59:27,482
- Hmm.

966
00:59:28,389 --> 00:59:29,972
What's your secret?

967
00:59:34,183 --> 00:59:36,808
- You still hangin' around?

968
00:59:36,809 --> 00:59:39,697
Cat Fish, I'm givin' you a choice.

969
00:59:39,698 --> 00:59:42,943
Ride with me and take a
share like everybody else,

970
00:59:42,944 --> 00:59:45,694
or I'll let you and the bitch go.

971
00:59:48,274 --> 00:59:49,476
- Count me in.

972
00:59:49,477 --> 00:59:52,144
- Cat Fish, Cat Fish, you prick!

973
00:59:54,653 --> 00:59:56,163
Fuck you, Reaper.

974
00:59:56,164 --> 00:59:57,801
- Tried it, Skin.

975
00:59:57,802 --> 01:00:00,052
It wasn't worth the effort.

976
01:00:01,418 --> 01:00:03,811
- Bastard, son of a bitch!

977
01:00:03,812 --> 01:00:05,895
Cat Fish, come back here!

978
01:00:06,827 --> 01:00:09,609
- Don't worry, somebody'll
come and keep you company,

979
01:00:09,610 --> 01:00:12,027
coyote, mountain lion, maybe.

980
01:00:12,945 --> 01:00:15,209
- You just gonna leave her here, Reaper?

981
01:00:15,210 --> 01:00:17,625
She knows an awful lot
about what we're doin'.

982
01:00:17,626 --> 01:00:18,709
- She's bait.

983
01:00:19,926 --> 01:00:23,176
(motorcycles rumbling)

984
01:00:38,485 --> 01:00:39,485
- Bastard!

985
01:00:41,168 --> 01:00:43,123
- You take the hills.

986
01:00:43,124 --> 01:00:45,223
- This could be dangerous.

987
01:00:45,224 --> 01:00:47,051
- Yeah, so is crossing the street.

988
01:00:47,052 --> 01:00:50,302
(motorcycles rumbling)

989
01:00:54,254 --> 01:00:56,921
(pensive music)

990
01:01:07,545 --> 01:01:09,464
- We're looking for a cave.

991
01:01:09,465 --> 01:01:11,366
Two shares to the man who finds it first.

992
01:01:11,367 --> 01:01:14,617
(motorcycles rumbling)

993
01:01:28,901 --> 01:01:32,095
(motorcycles rumbling in distance)

994
01:01:32,096 --> 01:01:35,591
- Professor, it looks
like somebody's coming.

995
01:01:35,592 --> 01:01:38,842
(motorcycles rumbling)

996
01:01:40,775 --> 01:01:43,308
- Visitors from the real world.

997
01:01:43,309 --> 01:01:46,676
Maybe they know who won the World Series.

998
01:01:46,677 --> 01:01:49,844
(motorcycle rumbling)

999
01:01:55,237 --> 01:01:57,737
(tense music)

1000
01:02:39,543 --> 01:02:41,758
(panting)

1001
01:02:41,759 --> 01:02:42,759
- Wade.

1002
01:02:43,899 --> 01:02:46,737
(gun fires)

1003
01:02:46,738 --> 01:02:47,738
Wade!

1004
01:02:50,645 --> 01:02:52,877
(Skin groans)

1005
01:02:52,878 --> 01:02:55,545
Wade! (panting)

1006
01:02:56,605 --> 01:02:57,605
Bastards!

1007
01:02:58,932 --> 01:03:01,952
- (laughs) You got him smack
in the middle of the head, man.

1008
01:03:01,953 --> 01:03:03,870
- Nah, just grazed him.

1009
01:03:05,097 --> 01:03:06,815
- [Man Wearing Vest] Hey,
where'd that old guy go?

1010
01:03:06,816 --> 01:03:07,969
- Fuck him!

1011
01:03:07,970 --> 01:03:09,338
This is the one Reaper wants.

1012
01:03:09,339 --> 01:03:10,172
- All right.

1013
01:03:10,173 --> 01:03:14,339
(tense music)
(motorcycles rumbling)

1014
01:03:15,863 --> 01:03:17,998
- Where's your dog now, asshole?

1015
01:03:17,999 --> 01:03:22,166
(tense music)
(motorcycles rumbling)

1016
01:03:57,310 --> 01:03:59,408
- What's wrong with you, badass?

1017
01:03:59,409 --> 01:04:00,852
Thirsty?

1018
01:04:00,853 --> 01:04:03,103
(laughing)

1019
01:04:06,096 --> 01:04:08,577
- Come on, let's get outta here.

1020
01:04:08,578 --> 01:04:12,745
(motorcycle rumbling)
(tense rock music)

1021
01:04:30,070 --> 01:04:32,626
Oh, hey, man, hey, I'm sorry.

1022
01:04:32,627 --> 01:04:36,119
Look, once you get up, we'll
go a little bit slower.

1023
01:04:36,120 --> 01:04:38,370
(laughing)

1024
01:04:39,448 --> 01:04:40,281
Ready?

1025
01:04:40,281 --> 01:04:41,114
Let's go.

1026
01:04:41,115 --> 01:04:42,727
(motorcycle rumbling)

1027
01:04:42,728 --> 01:04:43,783
(yelling)

1028
01:04:43,784 --> 01:04:46,062
(laughing)

1029
01:04:46,063 --> 01:04:48,362
Come on, pretty boy, here we go!

1030
01:04:48,363 --> 01:04:51,215
(laughing)
(tense rock music)

1031
01:04:51,216 --> 01:04:52,216
Hold on.

1032
01:04:54,116 --> 01:04:55,651
Havin' fun?

1033
01:04:55,652 --> 01:04:56,814
Havin' fun back there?

1034
01:04:56,815 --> 01:04:58,426
(laughing)

1035
01:04:58,427 --> 01:05:00,677
(mumbling)

1036
01:05:26,578 --> 01:05:28,678
- Looks like you could use some help.

1037
01:05:28,679 --> 01:05:29,792
- [Skin] Who are you?

1038
01:05:29,793 --> 01:05:32,376
- Folks call me the Rain Maker.

1039
01:05:33,491 --> 01:05:34,914
- [Skin] You're the Rain Maker?

1040
01:05:34,915 --> 01:05:36,729
- [Rain Maker] Mm-hmm.

1041
01:05:36,730 --> 01:05:38,385
- I've heard of you.

1042
01:05:38,386 --> 01:05:39,773
Are you with Reaper?

1043
01:05:39,774 --> 01:05:42,024
- I made that mistake once.

1044
01:05:43,874 --> 01:05:46,354
Now I'm lookin' for him
and a man named Wade.

1045
01:05:46,355 --> 01:05:48,061
- Wade Olson?

1046
01:05:48,062 --> 01:05:50,914
He was here, they shot him.

1047
01:05:50,915 --> 01:05:51,972
- What?

1048
01:05:51,973 --> 01:05:53,870
- Well, they just grazed
him and he's okay,

1049
01:05:53,871 --> 01:05:55,798
but they take him away to meet Reaper.

1050
01:05:55,799 --> 01:05:59,049
(motorcycles rumbling)

1051
01:06:09,196 --> 01:06:11,197
- Which way now, man?

1052
01:06:11,198 --> 01:06:13,996
- [Man With Mustache] He said
between the two tallest peaks.

1053
01:06:13,997 --> 01:06:14,875
- [Man Wearing Vest]
Guess that'd be those two

1054
01:06:14,876 --> 01:06:16,987
up there on the left.

1055
01:06:16,988 --> 01:06:18,071
- I guess so.

1056
01:06:20,763 --> 01:06:22,943
They all look the same to me.

1057
01:06:22,944 --> 01:06:24,458
Let's get the hell outta here.

1058
01:06:24,459 --> 01:06:27,709
(motorcycles rumbling)

1059
01:06:32,133 --> 01:06:33,300
What the fuck?

1060
01:06:34,670 --> 01:06:36,616
What the fuck is goin' on?

1061
01:06:36,617 --> 01:06:38,543
- Geez, he's got it wrapped around a rock.

1062
01:06:38,544 --> 01:06:39,544
- What?

1063
01:06:41,806 --> 01:06:43,633
Yeah, I'm gonna kick his fuckin' ass.

1064
01:06:43,634 --> 01:06:45,281
You stupid, what are you?

1065
01:06:45,282 --> 01:06:47,284
(thudding)
(groaning)

1066
01:06:47,285 --> 01:06:48,702
- Son of a bitch!

1067
01:06:49,709 --> 01:06:51,459
You're dead, asshole!

1068
01:06:52,874 --> 01:06:54,957
You are one dead asshole.

1069
01:06:57,492 --> 01:06:59,695
I'm draggin' back a corpse.

1070
01:06:59,696 --> 01:07:02,029
(gun fires)

1071
01:07:09,285 --> 01:07:12,185
- Good timin', Rain Maker.

1072
01:07:12,186 --> 01:07:13,243
What'd you bring her along for?

1073
01:07:13,244 --> 01:07:15,269
Reaper could be anywhere.

1074
01:07:15,270 --> 01:07:17,494
- Nice to see you again too, Wade.

1075
01:07:17,495 --> 01:07:18,328
- I am glad to see you.

1076
01:07:18,329 --> 01:07:19,334
It's dangerous, that's all.

1077
01:07:19,335 --> 01:07:20,168
- [Rain Maker] Looks like they drug you

1078
01:07:20,169 --> 01:07:21,918
halfway across the desert.

1079
01:07:21,919 --> 01:07:23,262
- [Skin] Are you all right, Wade?

1080
01:07:23,263 --> 01:07:25,144
I was really worried about you.

1081
01:07:25,145 --> 01:07:27,536
- [Wade] Yeah, I'm fine,
I enjoy being (mumbles).

1082
01:07:27,537 --> 01:07:29,794
- [Rain Maker] Hey, Wade, what's the plan?

1083
01:07:29,795 --> 01:07:31,564
- Reaper's not far from
here, I think we can reach...

1084
01:07:31,565 --> 01:07:35,065
- [Man With Mustache] Hold it right there.

1085
01:07:36,015 --> 01:07:37,766
- Hey, come on, man.

1086
01:07:37,767 --> 01:07:38,832
Just be cool and put that thing down.

1087
01:07:38,833 --> 01:07:40,751
- Hey, just stay back, asshole, okay?

1088
01:07:40,752 --> 01:07:42,803
- Come on, just show us some
mercy and we'll show you some.

1089
01:07:42,804 --> 01:07:44,182
- Mercy?

1090
01:07:44,183 --> 01:07:48,389
What do I look like to you,
Florence fuckin' Nightingale?

1091
01:07:48,390 --> 01:07:51,818
- Hey, man, don't say I
didn't give you a chance.

1092
01:07:51,819 --> 01:07:52,816
- Yeah.

1093
01:07:52,817 --> 01:07:55,149
(gun fires)

1094
01:07:58,138 --> 01:07:59,971
- I gave him a chance.

1095
01:08:01,370 --> 01:08:03,120
- Who do I ride with?

1096
01:08:04,936 --> 01:08:07,170
- Why don't you take a
Greyhound back to Nebraska?

1097
01:08:07,171 --> 01:08:10,314
- Very funny, you're
not gonna leave me here.

1098
01:08:10,315 --> 01:08:12,226
- Skin, this could be dangerous.

1099
01:08:12,227 --> 01:08:15,998
- What do you care what happens to me?

1100
01:08:15,999 --> 01:08:18,023
- Look, you're a nice kid, that's all.

1101
01:08:18,024 --> 01:08:21,524
- Kid, Wade, have you looked at me lately?

1102
01:08:24,102 --> 01:08:26,712
- Hey, just go ahead and do
whatever you want, all right?

1103
01:08:26,713 --> 01:08:27,713
- I will.

1104
01:08:30,644 --> 01:08:33,811
(motorcycle rumbling)

1105
01:08:37,707 --> 01:08:40,207
(tense music)

1106
01:09:04,281 --> 01:09:05,814
(grunting)

1107
01:09:05,815 --> 01:09:06,911
(woman screaming)

1108
01:09:06,912 --> 01:09:08,245
- That's enough!

1109
01:09:13,064 --> 01:09:14,454
Who are you?

1110
01:09:14,455 --> 01:09:17,127
- Leonard Bowen, professor at UNM.

1111
01:09:17,128 --> 01:09:18,299
- Professor of what?

1112
01:09:18,300 --> 01:09:19,133
- History.

1113
01:09:19,134 --> 01:09:21,101
- What are you doing out here?

1114
01:09:21,102 --> 01:09:22,457
- It's a field trip.

1115
01:09:22,458 --> 01:09:23,312
Navajo Nation is...

1116
01:09:23,313 --> 01:09:25,380
- Have you found a cave?

1117
01:09:25,381 --> 01:09:26,216
- Cave?

1118
01:09:26,216 --> 01:09:27,216
- A cave!

1119
01:09:28,070 --> 01:09:29,592
Look at this!

1120
01:09:29,593 --> 01:09:31,737
Have you seen this cave?

1121
01:09:31,738 --> 01:09:35,063
- No, there are no caves up here!

1122
01:09:35,064 --> 01:09:37,147
(grunts)

1123
01:09:39,820 --> 01:09:42,120
- Reaper, let us have the bitches, man.

1124
01:09:42,121 --> 01:09:43,229
- When we're finished!

1125
01:09:43,230 --> 01:09:44,707
- Come on, that's bullshit!

1126
01:09:44,708 --> 01:09:46,240
There's no caves.

1127
01:09:46,241 --> 01:09:48,500
We followed you halfway across the desert.

1128
01:09:48,501 --> 01:09:50,946
There's no caves, there's no gold.

1129
01:09:50,947 --> 01:09:52,947
Let us have the bitches.

1130
01:09:55,048 --> 01:09:59,600
(gun fires)
(groans)

1131
01:09:59,601 --> 01:10:02,727
- I said when we're finished.

1132
01:10:02,728 --> 01:10:06,283
- If my guess is right, this is it.

1133
01:10:06,284 --> 01:10:07,867
- What do you mean?

1134
01:10:09,071 --> 01:10:10,654
- Give me your map.

1135
01:10:18,015 --> 01:10:20,922
I don't think it's a cave,
I think it's a marker.

1136
01:10:20,923 --> 01:10:22,235
- [Reaper] Meaning what?

1137
01:10:22,236 --> 01:10:24,313
- Meaning your map leads you here

1138
01:10:24,314 --> 01:10:26,649
to match those black shapes.

1139
01:10:26,650 --> 01:10:29,364
From here, you have to
read both maps together.

1140
01:10:29,365 --> 01:10:30,925
- Yeah, so go ahead.

1141
01:10:30,926 --> 01:10:33,500
- Well, there's a
lightning bolt on both maps

1142
01:10:33,501 --> 01:10:36,371
in the corners, unrelated
to anything else.

1143
01:10:36,372 --> 01:10:38,205
Your map has 15 marks.

1144
01:10:39,489 --> 01:10:41,401
Just marks, nothing else.

1145
01:10:41,402 --> 01:10:43,957
- I thought the gold would
be buried 15 feet deep.

1146
01:10:43,958 --> 01:10:44,958
- The gold?

1147
01:10:45,843 --> 01:10:47,304
My God, you don't think
Quantrill's Raiders

1148
01:10:47,305 --> 01:10:49,043
brought the gold here?

1149
01:10:49,044 --> 01:10:51,292
- Don't care who the fuck brought it here.

1150
01:10:51,293 --> 01:10:53,068
I'm the one that's takin' it away.

1151
01:10:53,069 --> 01:10:55,736
(pensive music)

1152
01:11:01,464 --> 01:11:03,510
- Maybe the marks on your map means miles

1153
01:11:03,511 --> 01:11:07,238
and the squiggly line on
the wall indicates a river.

1154
01:11:07,239 --> 01:11:09,834
The teepees are 15 miles down river,

1155
01:11:09,835 --> 01:11:11,600
an Indian camp or something.

1156
01:11:11,601 --> 01:11:13,427
- So what's the lightning?

1157
01:11:13,428 --> 01:11:15,102
- We find out when we get there.

1158
01:11:15,103 --> 01:11:15,936
- Get where?

1159
01:11:15,937 --> 01:11:19,001
There isn't a river
within 100 miles of here.

1160
01:11:19,002 --> 01:11:20,270
- Not anymore.

1161
01:11:20,271 --> 01:11:22,938
(pensive music)

1162
01:11:29,559 --> 01:11:30,908
- [Man Wearing Bandana]
So what are we gonna do?

1163
01:11:30,909 --> 01:11:32,203
- Keep the girls here a couple hours

1164
01:11:32,204 --> 01:11:34,804
in case this doesn't work out.

1165
01:11:34,805 --> 01:11:36,665
I don't want you touchin' 'em.

1166
01:11:36,666 --> 01:11:37,644
- Then what?

1167
01:11:37,645 --> 01:11:39,061
- Catch up to us!

1168
01:11:40,301 --> 01:11:42,765
- And what do we do about them?

1169
01:11:42,766 --> 01:11:43,903
- Whatever you want.

1170
01:11:43,904 --> 01:11:45,296
Move out!

1171
01:11:45,297 --> 01:11:48,547
(motorcycles rumbling)

1172
01:11:50,147 --> 01:11:53,285
(women gasping)

1173
01:11:53,286 --> 01:11:54,534
(tense music)

1174
01:11:54,535 --> 01:11:57,710
- All right, ladies, naptime's over.

1175
01:11:57,711 --> 01:11:59,782
- [Woman] No, no, don't hurt us!

1176
01:11:59,783 --> 01:12:02,616
(women screaming)

1177
01:12:06,477 --> 01:12:08,977
(tense music)

1178
01:12:10,815 --> 01:12:13,187
- You can't do this, you
heard what Reaper said.

1179
01:12:13,188 --> 01:12:15,661
- Mr. Reaper was called away on business.

1180
01:12:15,662 --> 01:12:17,628
I'll be operating in his stead.

1181
01:12:17,629 --> 01:12:18,897
- You saw what he did to the other guy.

1182
01:12:18,898 --> 01:12:20,651
He'll do the same to you!

1183
01:12:20,652 --> 01:12:22,939
- Reaper's not here anymore, dickhead!

1184
01:12:22,940 --> 01:12:23,773
(women gasping)

1185
01:12:23,774 --> 01:12:25,492
Who wants to go first?

1186
01:12:25,493 --> 01:12:26,552
You, mama!

1187
01:12:26,553 --> 01:12:28,556
I want that bike polished.

1188
01:12:28,557 --> 01:12:29,873
Come on, do it, now!

1189
01:12:29,874 --> 01:12:31,656
- I have nothing to use.

1190
01:12:31,657 --> 01:12:33,907
- Use them rags you got on!

1191
01:12:34,957 --> 01:12:37,790
Do it!
(gun fires)

1192
01:12:38,924 --> 01:12:39,924
All of it!

1193
01:12:40,632 --> 01:12:42,882
All of it, baby, all of it!

1194
01:12:43,848 --> 01:12:44,848
- I won't.

1195
01:12:45,593 --> 01:12:47,401
Do what you want.

1196
01:12:47,402 --> 01:12:48,935
- Why don't you do as you're told?

1197
01:12:48,936 --> 01:12:51,381
(woman crying)

1198
01:12:51,382 --> 01:12:52,714
- Come on, ladies.

1199
01:12:52,715 --> 01:12:55,980
We got bikes enough for all y'all!

1200
01:12:55,981 --> 01:12:57,314
Come on!

1201
01:12:57,315 --> 01:12:59,546
Get to work now!
(gun fires)

1202
01:12:59,547 --> 01:13:02,511
(man laughing)

1203
01:13:02,512 --> 01:13:04,026
Let's go.

1204
01:13:04,027 --> 01:13:07,545
Fellas, we're gonna go on a
date tonight to the movies,

1205
01:13:07,546 --> 01:13:08,828
hey, Jefferson?

1206
01:13:08,829 --> 01:13:09,808
Come on!

1207
01:13:09,809 --> 01:13:12,481
- [Jefferson] Yeah, now polish!

1208
01:13:12,482 --> 01:13:14,527
- I don't wanna see any
more dust on it, come on!

1209
01:13:14,528 --> 01:13:16,179
Move it, move it!

1210
01:13:16,180 --> 01:13:17,607
Harder!

1211
01:13:17,608 --> 01:13:18,441
Harder!

1212
01:13:18,442 --> 01:13:20,941
(tense music)

1213
01:13:22,097 --> 01:13:23,214
Do it!

1214
01:13:23,215 --> 01:13:24,724
Yeah, look at these ladies.

1215
01:13:24,725 --> 01:13:26,306
Mr. Jefferson, are you happy?

1216
01:13:26,307 --> 01:13:27,140
- Yeah, they polish good.

1217
01:13:27,141 --> 01:13:30,638
- Your motorcycle's lookin'
mighty fine today, yeah!

1218
01:13:30,639 --> 01:13:31,765
Yeah!

1219
01:13:31,766 --> 01:13:34,732
Come on, ladies, you havin' fun now?

1220
01:13:34,733 --> 01:13:36,516
Come on, honey.

1221
01:13:36,517 --> 01:13:38,852
Let's go.
(woman groaning)

1222
01:13:38,853 --> 01:13:40,308
Do it.

1223
01:13:40,309 --> 01:13:41,646
(fabric ripping)

1224
01:13:41,647 --> 01:13:42,897
Come on, do it!

1225
01:13:47,139 --> 01:13:48,510
Come on.

1226
01:13:48,511 --> 01:13:50,409
Come on, Jefferson wants his bike clean!

1227
01:13:50,410 --> 01:13:51,457
Now, do it!

1228
01:13:51,458 --> 01:13:54,211
Come on, bitch, I don't
see you movin' anymore!

1229
01:13:54,212 --> 01:13:55,212
Let's go!

1230
01:13:55,941 --> 01:13:57,012
Don't miss no spot.

1231
01:13:57,013 --> 01:14:00,904
You heard what the man said. (mumbles)

1232
01:14:00,905 --> 01:14:02,599
I don't know if I can control myself

1233
01:14:02,600 --> 01:14:05,433
with all this jigglin' around here.

1234
01:14:05,434 --> 01:14:07,667
I think I'm gonna get ready
to break Reaper's rule.

1235
01:14:07,668 --> 01:14:09,246
(crying)

1236
01:14:09,247 --> 01:14:11,473
- Yeah, and I'll start right now.

1237
01:14:11,474 --> 01:14:12,474
- No!

1238
01:14:13,164 --> 01:14:15,280
(gun fires)

1239
01:14:15,281 --> 01:14:16,114
- Take cover!

1240
01:14:16,115 --> 01:14:20,281
(guns firing)
(tense music)

1241
01:14:51,611 --> 01:14:52,444
- Take this.

1242
01:14:52,444 --> 01:14:53,339
- Okay.

1243
01:14:53,340 --> 01:14:55,506
- Oh, Wade, hold on tight.

1244
01:14:56,721 --> 01:14:57,721
Hey, Wade!

1245
01:15:01,983 --> 01:15:02,983
God dang!

1246
01:15:04,864 --> 01:15:06,531
- Surprise, asshole!

1247
01:15:07,569 --> 01:15:09,902
I'm really gonna enjoy this.

1248
01:15:12,237 --> 01:15:14,570
(gun fires)

1249
01:15:15,568 --> 01:15:16,540
(Skin laughs)

1250
01:15:16,541 --> 01:15:20,187
(laughing)
- [Skin] All right!

1251
01:15:20,188 --> 01:15:22,019
(howling)

1252
01:15:22,020 --> 01:15:23,020
- Yeah!

1253
01:15:24,170 --> 01:15:26,920
(mystical music)

1254
01:15:27,776 --> 01:15:31,026
(motorcycles rumbling)

1255
01:15:56,997 --> 01:15:59,664
(pensive music)

1256
01:16:04,858 --> 01:16:06,025
- Sweet Jesus.

1257
01:16:15,196 --> 01:16:17,508
- Skin, I want you to ride
back to L.A. with the girls.

1258
01:16:17,509 --> 01:16:19,221
- You can't tell me what to do.

1259
01:16:19,222 --> 01:16:20,294
- I'm not tellin' you, I'm askin' you.

1260
01:16:20,295 --> 01:16:22,127
The scene could be dangerous.

1261
01:16:22,128 --> 01:16:23,149
- Really?

1262
01:16:23,150 --> 01:16:25,091
- Look, just ride back
to L.A. with the girls.

1263
01:16:25,092 --> 01:16:26,740
I'll look you up when the scene's over.

1264
01:16:26,741 --> 01:16:27,621
- Sure you will.

1265
01:16:27,622 --> 01:16:30,690
You'll find the gold and I'll
be just another bimbo memory.

1266
01:16:30,691 --> 01:16:32,774
- I'm not after the gold.

1267
01:16:37,963 --> 01:16:41,130
(motorcycle rumbling)

1268
01:16:56,113 --> 01:16:58,530
(clattering)

1269
01:16:59,920 --> 01:17:03,087
(eerie pensive music)

1270
01:17:36,872 --> 01:17:38,122
- Look at that.

1271
01:17:39,221 --> 01:17:40,804
Reaper, I found it!

1272
01:17:42,756 --> 01:17:45,457
- Start digging where the
lightning bolt points.

1273
01:17:45,458 --> 01:17:46,512
It won't be too deep.

1274
01:17:46,513 --> 01:17:51,056
When they buried it, they
didn't have much time.

1275
01:17:51,057 --> 01:17:52,123
Neither do I.

1276
01:17:52,124 --> 01:17:54,791
(pensive music)

1277
01:18:33,418 --> 01:18:36,001
(bluesy Western music)

1278
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:54,761
- I'll handle this, you go after Reaper.

1279
01:18:54,762 --> 01:18:55,762
- All right.

1280
01:19:01,428 --> 01:19:02,767
(gun fires)

1281
01:19:02,768 --> 01:19:05,351
(bluesy Western music)

1282
01:19:06,646 --> 01:19:09,146
(guns firing)

1283
01:19:20,880 --> 01:19:24,456
(smacking)
(groaning)

1284
01:19:24,457 --> 01:19:27,207
(mystical music)

1285
01:19:28,275 --> 01:19:30,858
(bluesy Western music)

1286
01:19:37,177 --> 01:19:39,677
(tense music)

1287
01:20:03,367 --> 01:20:07,534
(motorcycle rumbling in distance)

1288
01:20:20,836 --> 01:20:23,276
- Come to papa, sucka!

1289
01:20:23,277 --> 01:20:25,247
(chuckling)

1290
01:20:25,248 --> 01:20:27,748
(tense music)

1291
01:20:29,043 --> 01:20:33,210
(guns firing)
(energetic rock music)

1292
01:20:56,083 --> 01:20:57,795
What the hell is this?

1293
01:20:57,796 --> 01:21:00,162
(motorcycle rumbling)

1294
01:21:00,163 --> 01:21:03,963
What the hell is this darn thing anyhow?

1295
01:21:03,964 --> 01:21:04,797
(beeping)

1296
01:21:04,798 --> 01:21:07,464
(loud blasting)

1297
01:21:09,458 --> 01:21:11,958
(tense music)

1298
01:21:17,799 --> 01:21:19,049
- Hey, asshole.

1299
01:21:21,120 --> 01:21:22,203
Drop the gun.

1300
01:21:23,221 --> 01:21:24,888
I said drop the gun.

1301
01:21:25,880 --> 01:21:27,463
- Aw, come on, kid,

1302
01:21:28,465 --> 01:21:31,153
you wouldn't shoot an old man, would you?

1303
01:21:31,154 --> 01:21:34,479
- Yeah, yeah, I think I would.

1304
01:21:34,480 --> 01:21:36,744
- Without a fair fight?

1305
01:21:36,745 --> 01:21:40,623
- You think you're a real
cowboy, don't you, Grandpa?

1306
01:21:40,624 --> 01:21:41,624
- Could be.

1307
01:21:42,698 --> 01:21:44,737
(bluesy Western music)

1308
01:21:44,738 --> 01:21:46,738
- Well, then let's draw.

1309
01:21:48,284 --> 01:21:50,784
(tense music)

1310
01:21:53,205 --> 01:21:55,218
(gun fires)
(groans)

1311
01:21:55,219 --> 01:21:57,415
(mystical music)

1312
01:21:57,416 --> 01:22:00,499
(slow Western music)

1313
01:22:17,819 --> 01:22:19,902
- Get it out, dig it out!

1314
01:22:24,698 --> 01:22:26,948
(laughing)

1315
01:22:32,100 --> 01:22:34,767
(pensive music)

1316
01:22:35,855 --> 01:22:36,855
It's here!

1317
01:22:37,996 --> 01:22:40,996
It's gold! (laughs)

1318
01:22:42,499 --> 01:22:43,499
Gold, gold!

1319
01:22:45,998 --> 01:22:46,998
- Yeah.

1320
01:22:47,771 --> 01:22:48,771
This is it.

1321
01:22:49,758 --> 01:22:52,008
(laughing)

1322
01:22:53,607 --> 01:22:56,636
After all this time, after all this time.

1323
01:22:56,637 --> 01:22:59,304
(pensive music)

1324
01:23:09,332 --> 01:23:11,665
(gun fires)

1325
01:23:18,485 --> 01:23:19,485
Reaper,

1326
01:23:21,643 --> 01:23:24,447
I thought we had a deal.

1327
01:23:24,448 --> 01:23:26,453
- Partnerships dissolve.

1328
01:23:26,454 --> 01:23:27,342
(gun fires)

1329
01:23:27,343 --> 01:23:29,842
(tense music)

1330
01:23:31,309 --> 01:23:33,825
We never coulda trusted him.

1331
01:23:33,826 --> 01:23:35,576
Now we won't have to.

1332
01:23:38,386 --> 01:23:40,216
- [Man With Beard] Tester,
we're takin' the gold down.

1333
01:23:40,217 --> 01:23:41,263
Guard the road.

1334
01:23:41,264 --> 01:23:43,764
(tense music)

1335
01:24:17,092 --> 01:24:19,092
- Get away from my gold.

1336
01:24:21,436 --> 01:24:23,705
- It's my gold too, come
all this way with you.

1337
01:24:23,706 --> 01:24:25,241
- I'm not sharin' this with anybody,

1338
01:24:25,242 --> 01:24:27,897
especially some two-bit grease monkey.

1339
01:24:27,898 --> 01:24:29,506
- What about loyalty, man?

1340
01:24:29,507 --> 01:24:31,814
- (laughs) Fuck loyalty.

1341
01:24:31,815 --> 01:24:35,197
(gun fires)
(groaning)

1342
01:24:35,198 --> 01:24:37,615
(gun firing)

1343
01:24:52,828 --> 01:24:55,328
(tense music)

1344
01:25:00,814 --> 01:25:01,647
(grunting)

1345
01:25:01,648 --> 01:25:05,054
(tense rock music)

1346
01:25:05,055 --> 01:25:09,222
(thudding)
(groaning)

1347
01:25:53,204 --> 01:25:55,871
(ominous music)

1348
01:26:04,949 --> 01:26:07,199
(groaning)

1349
01:26:13,112 --> 01:26:15,612
(tense music)

1350
01:26:22,536 --> 01:26:24,703
(panting)

1351
01:26:44,290 --> 01:26:47,599
- They won't help you this time, Reaper.

1352
01:26:47,600 --> 01:26:50,928
The ones I didn't kill, you did.

1353
01:26:50,929 --> 01:26:52,346
- We'll go 50-50.

1354
01:26:53,347 --> 01:26:55,633
I have a lotta gold here, Olson.

1355
01:26:55,634 --> 01:26:58,312
- Gold ain't worth much
where you're headed, Reaper.

1356
01:26:58,313 --> 01:27:01,103
- God, you got a small mind, Olson.

1357
01:27:01,104 --> 01:27:04,271
Go ahead then, take me back to prison.

1358
01:27:05,377 --> 01:27:06,710
- Not this time!

1359
01:27:08,297 --> 01:27:09,717
(wood boards snapping)

1360
01:27:09,718 --> 01:27:13,885
(wood creaking)
(tense music)

1361
01:27:14,826 --> 01:27:18,993
(wood boards snapping)
(grunting)

1362
01:27:23,885 --> 01:27:25,145
(wood boards creaking and snapping)

1363
01:27:25,146 --> 01:27:27,396
(grunting)

1364
01:27:32,528 --> 01:27:35,776
(echoing scream)

1365
01:27:35,777 --> 01:27:38,610
(pulley rattling)

1366
01:27:41,640 --> 01:27:44,307
(wood creaking)

1367
01:27:46,864 --> 01:27:49,531
(loud crashing)

1368
01:27:52,397 --> 01:27:54,897
(tense music)

1369
01:28:10,636 --> 01:28:12,469
- Where you goin' now?

1370
01:28:14,067 --> 01:28:17,538
- Oh, I don't know,
maybe Mexico for a while.

1371
01:28:17,539 --> 01:28:18,794
How 'bout you?

1372
01:28:18,795 --> 01:28:21,152
- Nah, I'm off to Hawaii.

1373
01:28:21,153 --> 01:28:23,852
(motorcycle rumbling)

1374
01:28:23,853 --> 01:28:26,726
- I wanna thank you for riding
shotgun with me on this.

1375
01:28:26,727 --> 01:28:27,954
- My pleasure.

1376
01:28:27,955 --> 01:28:30,564
You know, Hawaii this time
of year is worth a visit.

1377
01:28:30,565 --> 01:28:34,100
Yeah, there's a old, old, man there,

1378
01:28:34,101 --> 01:28:38,303
sort of a rain makin' kahuna. (mumbles)

1379
01:28:38,304 --> 01:28:40,001
Why don't you come with me?

1380
01:28:40,002 --> 01:28:42,934
- Nah, think I need some time alone.

1381
01:28:42,935 --> 01:28:44,852
- God be with you, son.

1382
01:28:52,420 --> 01:28:56,229
(motorcycle rumbling)

1383
01:28:56,230 --> 01:28:59,313
(pensive rock music)

1384
01:29:06,762 --> 01:29:09,929
(motorcycle rumbling)

1385
01:29:14,093 --> 01:29:17,093
(upbeat rock music)
