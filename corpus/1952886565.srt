00:29:11,249 --> 00:29:13,417
- If got on fucking sanitation,
I will be set for life.

702
00:29:13,543 --> 00:29:15,127
- You would.
- You know it?

703
00:29:15,253 --> 00:29:17,963
That's paid vacation,
good bennies, everything.

704
00:29:18,089 --> 00:29:18,964
- Everything.
- Yeah.

705
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:20,466
- Bennies, baby.

706
00:29:20,592 --> 00:29:22,634
- But is that what you really
want to do?

707
00:29:26,264 --> 00:29:28,348
- Wait,
who are you?

708
00:29:28,475 --> 00:29:30,893
[Laughter]

709
00:29:31,019 --> 00:29:32,728
- Don't look down on garbage,
my friend.

710
00:29:32,854 --> 00:29:35,647
See, they even got people
who study what you throw out.

711
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:38,817
It tells you all kinds of things
about your personality.

712
00:29:38,943 --> 00:29:40,569
- Ohhh,
what are you gonna do,

713
00:29:40,695 --> 00:29:42,154
examine people's garbage

714
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:44,198
and tell them why
they lack self-esteem?

715
00:29:44,324 --> 00:29:47,826
- Jerry flanagan,
garbageman psychiatrist.

716
00:29:47,952 --> 00:29:49,620
- The shrink with the stink.

717
00:29:49,746 --> 00:29:50,996
- Yeah, well, fuck you all.

718
00:29:51,122 --> 00:29:53,248
How about that?
How about fuck you?

719
00:29:53,374 --> 00:29:55,375
Yeah, and, leary,
what do you do, hm?

720
00:29:55,502 --> 00:29:56,794
You're a movie usher.

721
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:59,004
You spend your entire day just

722
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:00,839
fucking scraping gum
off of armrests.

723
00:30:00,965 --> 00:30:02,132
- And no bennies.

724
00:30:02,258 --> 00:30:03,884
- You know,
I got a lot of options.

725
00:30:04,010 --> 00:30:06,303
I could always go into business
with my brother if I wanted to.

726
00:30:06,429 --> 00:30:07,513
- Yeah, your brother.

727
00:30:07,639 --> 00:30:10,349
Like what,
gladiator school?

728
00:30:10,475 --> 00:30:12,851
- Hey, you guys,
I'll be right back, all right?

729
00:30:12,977 --> 00:30:13,852
[Together]
Aww, come on.

730
00:30:13,978 --> 00:30:15,312
- We were fucking joking.

731
00:30:15,438 --> 00:30:18,440
- [Giggles]

732
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:26,532
- [Laughs]

733
00:30:26,658 --> 00:30:29,535
What's up, man?

734
00:30:29,661 --> 00:30:32,079
- So when do you think
you want to go?

735
00:30:32,205 --> 00:30:33,163
- I don't know.

736
00:30:33,289 --> 00:30:37,209
- Yeah, come on.

737
00:30:37,335 --> 00:30:38,585
- Were you gonna say something,

738
00:30:38,711 --> 00:30:40,379
or are you just gonna
keep orbiting?

739
00:30:40,505 --> 00:30:44,091
- I am gonna say something,
as soon as I think of it.

740
00:30:44,217 --> 00:30:45,092
How about this?

741
00:30:45,218 --> 00:30:46,093
How do you know jerry?

742
00:30:46,219 --> 00:30:47,386
- Who?

743
00:30:47,512 --> 00:30:49,096
- It's fine.
It's fine.

744
00:30:49,222 --> 00:30:50,889
It's completely fine.
It's completely fine.

745
00:30:51,015 --> 00:30:52,891
Continue the party.

746
00:30:53,017 --> 00:30:55,561
- Jerry flanagan,
your host.

747
00:30:55,687 --> 00:30:57,563
- I just heard
there was a party.

748
00:31:00,733 --> 00:31:02,317
- Let me ask you a question.

749
00:31:02,443 --> 00:31:04,236
What's it mean when an artist
does that?

750
00:31:04,362 --> 00:31:08,115
- That.
Right.

751
00:31:08,241 --> 00:31:10,742
No idea.

752
00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:12,911
- Where'd you learn to draw
like that?

753
00:31:13,037 --> 00:31:15,914
- It's just something
I could always do.

754
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:17,958
- What's your name?

755
00:31:18,084 --> 00:31:19,334
- Brian leary.

756
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:20,544
We went to the same high school.

757
00:31:20,670 --> 00:31:23,338
You're shauna friel,
right?

758
00:31:23,464 --> 00:31:27,634
- Hm,
I don't remember you.

759
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:28,969
- Got to go.

760
00:31:29,095 --> 00:31:31,805
- Oh,
he's my best friend.

761
00:31:31,931 --> 00:31:34,892
- Okay, well, I was wondering
if maybe sometime-

762
00:31:35,018 --> 00:31:36,435
- you're not gonna ask
if you can draw me

763
00:31:36,561 --> 00:31:37,853
in the nude,
are you?

764
00:31:37,979 --> 00:31:39,396
- No, I always wear clothes
when I draw.

765
00:31:39,522 --> 00:31:41,273
I was going to ask you if maybe

766
00:31:41,399 --> 00:31:42,608
you wanted to have lunch
sometime.

767
00:31:42,734 --> 00:31:43,734
- Lunch.

768
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:45,819
- Yeah,
lunch is harmless.

769
00:31:45,945 --> 00:31:47,738
First date,
I always ask about lunch.

770
00:31:47,864 --> 00:31:50,824
Dinner's too open-ended.
What happens after?

771
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:52,075
You ask about breakfast,

772
00:31:52,201 --> 00:31:53,452
you get an instant slap
in the face,

773
00:31:53,578 --> 00:31:55,537
so that leaves you with lunch.

774
00:31:55,663 --> 00:31:57,372
- I can't.
I'm very busy at work.

775
00:31:57,498 --> 00:32:00,042
- Where do you work?
- Olympic travel.

776
00:32:00,168 --> 00:32:01,627
- You a travel agent?

777
00:32:01,753 --> 00:32:03,003
- You are quick.

778
00:32:03,129 --> 00:32:05,631
- So book yourself a trip
to lunch.

779
00:32:05,757 --> 00:32:08,300
- Got to start packing.
I'm moving to l.A.

780
00:32:08,426 --> 00:32:09,509
- How come?

781
00:32:09,636 --> 00:32:10,886
- Olympic's gonna transfer me.

782
00:32:11,012 --> 00:32:13,639
I'm opening up
the west coast shop.

783
00:32:13,765 --> 00:32:15,140
- No shit.

784
00:32:15,266 --> 00:32:18,852
- I wouldn't shit you,
billy.

785
00:32:18,978 --> 00:32:23,273
- Brian.

00:33:08,236 --> 00:33:09,695
- Brian.

796
00:33:09,821 --> 00:33:11,196
- What?

797
00:33:11,322 --> 00:33:13,407
- For attempting to assassinate
president ford.

798
00:33:13,533 --> 00:33:14,700
- Look at you.

799
00:33:14,826 --> 00:33:16,868
You look like
who did it and ran.

800
00:33:16,995 --> 00:33:18,704
What are you doing down there
in that basement?

801
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:21,707
- Working on a cure
for dandruff.

802
00:33:21,833 --> 00:33:24,292
- You spend too much time
down there, smart-ass.

803
00:33:24,419 --> 00:33:25,919
- Did they say why she did it?

804
00:33:26,045 --> 00:33:27,546
- What,
there has to be a reason?

805
00:33:27,672 --> 00:33:31,550
You kids are all crazy,
out of control.

806
00:33:31,676 --> 00:33:33,135
- Ma, what are you doing
to that thing?

807
00:33:33,261 --> 00:33:34,845
- Cleaning it.

808
00:33:34,971 --> 00:33:36,847
- I thought it was broken.
You were throwing it out.

809
00:33:36,973 --> 00:33:38,056
- I am.

810
00:33:38,182 --> 00:33:39,725
- So why are you cleaning it?

811
00:33:39,851 --> 00:33:41,893
- I can't put something
this filthy out in the garbage.

812
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:43,562
People will think we're pigs.

813
00:33:43,688 --> 00:33:45,564
- So you're cleaning
the garbage?

814
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:48,233
- Just eat
and mind your own business.

815
00:33:48,359 --> 00:33:50,235
- You know, you should
really meet my friend jerry.

816
00:33:50,361 --> 00:33:53,655
You guys both have a similar
healthy respect for garbage.

817
00:33:53,781 --> 00:33:56,241
Shit.

818
00:33:56,367 --> 00:33:58,618
I don't understand
how you can make food

819
00:33:58,745 --> 00:34:00,912
that's hotter than actual flame.

820
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:02,748
- It's good for you that way.

821
00:34:02,874 --> 00:34:05,042
- Yeah,
if you live on the sun.

822
00:34:05,168 --> 00:34:07,419
Where's dad?

823
00:34:07,545 --> 00:34:09,379
- Where do you think?

824
00:34:09,505 --> 00:34:14,134
- Parenting seminar?

825
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:17,387
[Laughter]

826
00:34:20,308 --> 00:34:24,519
- Look...

827
00:34:24,645 --> 00:34:28,482
I had two detectives here last
night looking for your brother.

828
00:34:28,608 --> 00:34:31,276
Thank god your father
wasn't here.

829
00:34:31,402 --> 00:34:32,527
- What did they want?

830
00:34:32,653 --> 00:34:34,112
- They wouldn't tell me.

831
00:34:34,238 --> 00:34:36,698
You know anything about this?

832
00:34:36,824 --> 00:34:38,450
- No.

833
00:34:38,576 --> 00:34:40,243
- I couldn't trust you guys
when I'm at work

834
00:34:40,369 --> 00:34:41,661
to stay out of trouble.

835
00:34:41,788 --> 00:34:44,790
Now I've got cops
coming to my door.

836
00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:47,125
I don't know what to do
with the pair of you.

837
00:34:47,251 --> 00:34:48,752
- What did I do?

838
00:34:48,878 --> 00:34:50,545
- I don't know,
but there's something going on

839
00:34:50,671 --> 00:34:52,214
down in that basement.

840
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:53,965
Don't make me have to
come down there after you.

841
00:34:54,092 --> 00:34:55,759
- Ma, there's nothing going on
down in the basement.

842
00:34:55,885 --> 00:34:57,094
- Don't you talk back to me.

843
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:58,178
- You just stay the hell
out of there.

844
00:34:58,304 --> 00:34:59,721
That's all.

845
00:34:59,847 --> 00:35:02,432
I find out
you're doing drugs down there,

846
00:35:02,558 --> 00:35:04,518
I swear,
I'll break your legs.

847
00:35:18,157 --> 00:35:19,699
- Well, what do you think
we should do, huh?

848
00:35:19,826 --> 00:35:21,076
What's your big idea?

849
00:35:21,202 --> 00:35:22,452
- You've got to fire
half of them.

850
00:35:22,578 --> 00:35:23,453
I'm telling you.

851
00:35:23,579 --> 00:35:25,664
- You looking for danny?

852
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:26,665
Who are you?

853
00:35:26,791 --> 00:35:28,166
- I'm his brother.

854
00:35:28,292 --> 00:35:32,671
- You're his partner in crime?

855
00:35:32,797 --> 00:35:34,673
It's all right.

856
00:35:34,799 --> 00:35:37,217
I'm the fella
your brother sells to.

857
00:35:37,343 --> 00:35:40,095
There's some nice bulk liquor
coming my way.

858
00:35:40,221 --> 00:35:42,764
- You're jimmy cheeks?

859
00:35:42,890 --> 00:35:44,516
- Maybe so,

860
00:35:44,642 --> 00:35:46,518
but nobody's
fucking stupid enough

861
00:35:46,644 --> 00:35:49,104
to call me that to my face.

862
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:53,066
- I'm very sorry,
mr. Cheeks.

863
00:35:53,192 --> 00:35:55,026
- You work for whitey,
right?

864
00:35:55,153 --> 00:35:56,862
How come he can afford
to pay you;

865
00:35:56,988 --> 00:35:59,406
he can't afford to pay me?

866
00:35:59,532 --> 00:36:01,533
- You're the one
that whitey owes?

867
00:36:01,659 --> 00:36:05,704
- Don't ask so many
fucking questions, huh?

868
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:08,582
If you're looking for danny,
he's picking up his friend ray.

869
00:36:08,708 --> 00:36:10,208
- Prison-guy ray?

870
00:36:10,334 --> 00:36:12,544
Oh, sorry, another question.

871
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:14,880
- Well,
he ain't good-samaritan ray.

872
00:36:15,006 --> 00:36:16,214
That's for sure.

873
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:18,925
[Laughter]

874
00:36:19,051 --> 00:36:22,262
Danny's meeting him
at rikers island right now,

875
00:36:22,388 --> 00:36:24,222
giving him a ride home.

876
00:36:24,348 --> 00:36:26,099
Your brother is good that way.

877
00:36:26,225 --> 00:36:29,561
He'd give you the shirt
off his back.

878
00:36:29,687 --> 00:36:33,064
- Okay, well,
when he comes back,

879
00:36:33,191 --> 00:36:35,775
can you tell him that I came by?

880
00:36:35,902 --> 00:36:37,194
It's important.

881
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:41,072
- Yes, I will write that down
right now.

882
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:42,407
- Right, okay.

883
00:36:42,533 --> 00:36:46,369
Well,
thanks for all your help.

884
00:36:49,248 --> 00:36:51,750
- I don't know.

885
00:36:51,876 --> 00:36:53,668
- I'm telling you,
nights are better.

886
00:36:53,794 --> 00:36:55,795
- Yeah, yeah.

887
00:36:55,922 --> 00:36:57,923
- People tip better when
they're going out for dinner

888
00:36:58,049 --> 00:37:01,051
and stuff like that.

889
00:37:12,396 --> 00:37:14,981
- [Clears throat]

890
00:37:15,107 --> 00:37:16,650
What are you doing here?

891
00:37:16,776 --> 00:37:18,109
- It's nice to see you too.

892
00:37:18,236 --> 00:37:19,903
I just came by to tell you
that the stones

893
00:37:20,029 --> 00:37:21,696
are gonna play the lafayette
on the 28th,

894
00:37:21,822 --> 00:37:22,822
and I wanted to invite you.

895
00:37:22,949 --> 00:37:24,115
- The rolling stones.

896
00:37:24,242 --> 00:37:25,200
- No,
the kidney stones.

897
00:37:25,326 --> 00:37:26,368
Yes,
the rolling stones.

898
00:37:26,494 --> 00:37:27,869
You coming?

899
00:37:27,995 --> 00:37:30,622
- Why would the rolling stones
play brooklyn?

900
00:37:30,748 --> 00:37:32,415
- What is it with you people?

901
00:37:32,541 --> 00:37:34,042
You act like brooklyn is some
sort of fucking hick town.

902
00:37:34,168 --> 00:37:35,418
It's the fourth-biggest city
in the country.

903
00:37:35,544 --> 00:37:36,795
- Brooklyn is not a city.

904
00:37:36,921 --> 00:37:38,421
- If it was,
it would be.

905
00:37:38,547 --> 00:37:40,590
- Yeah, well, the rolling stones
are gonna take one look

906
00:37:40,716 --> 00:37:42,801
at the lafayette and have
their 20th nervous breakdown.

907
00:37:42,927 --> 00:37:43,802
- Shit,
I can't get no.

908
00:37:43,928 --> 00:37:45,303
- No what?

909
00:37:45,429 --> 00:37:46,388
- Satisfaction.

910
00:37:46,514 --> 00:37:47,973
You coming or what?

911
00:37:48,099 --> 00:37:49,724
- I'll be gone by then.
- That's too bad.

912
00:37:49,850 --> 00:37:51,059
You don't work on sundays,
do you?

913
00:37:51,185 --> 00:37:52,227
- Work from home.

914
00:37:52,353 --> 00:37:53,270
- Come on.
- I'm serious.

915
00:37:53,396 --> 00:37:54,980
I read up on airline deals.

916
00:37:55,106 --> 00:37:56,606
Got to know what I'm doing
backwards and forwards

917
00:37:56,732 --> 00:37:58,108
before I get to l.A..

918
00:37:58,234 --> 00:37:59,567
It's not just a little store
like this.

919
00:37:59,694 --> 00:38:00,735
It's, like, five times as big.

920
00:38:00,861 --> 00:38:02,070
- Just take two hours off.

921
00:38:02,196 --> 00:38:03,363
We'll go somewhere,
just a walk.

922
00:38:03,489 --> 00:38:04,781
- Same category as lunch?

923
00:38:04,907 --> 00:38:06,741
- Exactly, it's harmless,
healthy,

924
00:38:06,867 --> 00:38:09,995
and this particular walk will be
historically educational.

925
00:38:10,121 --> 00:38:12,914
- Brian,
why do you want to do this?

926
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:14,708
I'm leaving in a few weeks.

927
00:38:14,834 --> 00:38:16,543
- I didn't say we had to go
pick out curtains, shauna.

928
00:38:16,669 --> 00:38:17,544
I'm talking about a walk.

929
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:19,504
- No.

930
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:20,672
- If no, just say no.

931
00:38:20,798 --> 00:38:21,965
- I say no every time I see you.

932
00:38:22,091 --> 00:38:23,300
- Would you make up your mind?

933
00:38:23,426 --> 00:38:24,968
Look, if you don't like it,

934
00:38:25,094 --> 00:38:26,845
all you got to do is avoid me
for a couple of weeks,

935
00:38:26,971 --> 00:38:28,013
and you're in the clear.

936
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:29,681
- And if I do like it?

937
00:38:29,807 --> 00:38:32,058
- Well, then, we'll make
a mutual suicide packet.

938
00:38:36,689 --> 00:38:38,857
- All right, tomorrow.

939
00:38:38,983 --> 00:38:42,861
- Tomorrow,
uh...Not available.

940
00:38:42,987 --> 00:38:45,488
Kidding.

941
00:38:45,614 --> 00:38:47,157
[Laughter]

942
00:38:47,283 --> 00:38:48,450
- There he is.

943
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:50,201
Join me in some fucking pussy.

944
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:51,328
- Dah-dah-dah.

945
00:38:51,454 --> 00:38:55,040
[Laughs]

946
00:38:55,166 --> 00:38:57,792
- [Speaking indistinctly]

947
00:38:57,918 --> 00:39:00,253
[Both speaking simultaneously]

948
00:39:00,379 --> 00:39:01,963
Watch.
Check it out. Check it out.

949
00:39:02,089 --> 00:39:05,717
Uhh, you got to-
you got to make it sharp.

950
00:39:05,843 --> 00:39:09,512
- That's a small dick
you got there.

951
00:39:09,638 --> 00:39:11,973
- Hey,
there he is.

952
00:39:12,099 --> 00:39:13,808
It's vincent van faggot.

953
00:39:13,934 --> 00:39:16,311
- I've been looking all over
for you.

954
00:39:16,437 --> 00:39:17,896
- You and everybody else.

955
00:39:18,022 --> 00:39:21,024
- The cops have been
coming around asking questions.

956
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:22,150
- No shit.

957
00:39:22,276 --> 00:39:23,610
There you go.

958
00:39:23,736 --> 00:39:25,570
- The detectives talked to mom.

959
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:27,113
- No one's looking for you,

960
00:39:27,239 --> 00:39:28,615
if that's what
you're worried about.

961
00:39:28,741 --> 00:39:31,242
- That's not what
I'm worried about.

962
00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:34,371
- This is my little brother.

963
00:39:34,497 --> 00:39:38,416
Fucking spends hours and hours
down here by himself

964
00:39:38,542 --> 00:39:40,001
painting drawings,
while the rest of us

965
00:39:40,127 --> 00:39:41,669
are out drinking
and getting laid.

966
00:39:41,796 --> 00:39:43,713
He wants to draw pictures
for a living,

967
00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:47,258
except he ain't got the balls
to admit it to anybody.

968
00:39:47,385 --> 00:39:48,760
- Get the fuck out.

969
00:39:48,886 --> 00:39:50,136
- What are you gonna do,
tell mommy?

970
00:39:50,262 --> 00:39:51,513
You don't have to worry.

971
00:39:51,639 --> 00:39:53,473
No one even touches you,
this little fuck.

972
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:55,266
He's a good boy.

973
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:58,603
Me, I sneeze too fucking hard,
I catch a fucking beating.

974
00:39:58,729 --> 00:40:01,356
- What do you want?

975
00:40:01,482 --> 00:40:02,774
- I came to get my shoe box.

976
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:04,317
- It's in my room.

977
00:40:04,443 --> 00:40:05,819
- All right.

978
00:40:05,945 --> 00:40:07,278
- Get out.

979
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:10,365
- Ohh, don't be upset,
little boy.

980
00:40:10,491 --> 00:40:12,784
I just want to put some color
on your cheeks.

981
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:13,952
- You fucking asshole.

982
00:40:14,078 --> 00:40:16,371
I'm gonna fucking kill you.

983
00:40:16,497 --> 00:40:17,414
You fuck!

984
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:19,082
- You mother...

985
00:40:19,208 --> 00:40:20,375
You fucking raise your hand,

986
00:40:20,501 --> 00:40:21,709
you better be ready
to finish it.

987
00:40:21,836 --> 00:40:25,213
You hear me?

988
00:40:25,339 --> 00:40:26,673
- You fucking jack me?

989
00:40:26,799 --> 00:40:28,049
You fucking jack me?

990
00:40:28,175 --> 00:40:29,050
You're fucking dead.

991
00:40:29,176 --> 00:40:30,260
You motherfucker.

992
00:40:30,386 --> 00:40:32,345
You're fucking dead.

993
00:40:32,471 --> 00:40:34,222
You're fucking dead.
You're fucking dead.

994
00:40:34,348 --> 00:40:35,598
You piece of shit.

995
00:40:35,724 --> 00:40:36,724
You're fucking dead.

996
00:40:36,851 --> 00:40:38,268
You hear me,
you scumbag?

997
00:40:38,394 --> 00:40:43,148
You're gonna fucking die
for that.

998
00:40:43,274 --> 00:40:44,482
Get the fuck out of here.

999
00:40:44,608 --> 00:40:46,651
All right.
All right.

1000
00:40:46,777 --> 00:40:50,363
Little fucker!

1001
00:40:50,489 --> 00:40:53,491
[Thunder booming]

1002
00:40:57,663 --> 00:40:59,789
- Danny.

1003
00:41:04,587 --> 00:41:05,837
Danny!

1004
00:41:05,963 --> 00:41:10,633
[Thunder booming]

1005
00:41:10,759 --> 00:41:12,385
I hear noises.

1006
00:41:12,511 --> 00:41:14,429
- It's just a storm.

1007
00:41:14,555 --> 00:41:16,431
- Does the thunder mean
god's mad?

1008
00:41:16,557 --> 00:41:18,766
- Yeah,
but not at us.

1009
00:41:18,893 --> 00:41:21,895
We're okay here.

1010
00:41:26,692 --> 00:41:27,692
Hey, look.

1011
00:41:27,818 --> 00:41:29,194
Watch this.

1012
00:41:32,156 --> 00:41:35,116
- [Giggling]

1013
00:41:39,121 --> 00:41:41,331
- Well,
I guess this is historic.

1014
00:41:41,457 --> 00:41:44,083
- Hey, anybody can take you
on a walk through prospect park.

1015
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:45,543
- Ah,
but a cemetery.

1016
00:41:45,669 --> 00:41:47,795
Now, that's class.

1017
00:41:47,922 --> 00:41:50,215
You gonna tell me what happened
to your face?

1018
00:41:50,341 --> 00:41:52,675
- Oh, I was practicing
for this walk, and I fell.

1019
00:41:55,763 --> 00:41:59,933
- Shit, brian,
who did that?

1020
00:42:00,059 --> 00:42:01,059
Look,
don't bullshit me.

1021
00:42:01,185 --> 00:42:02,185
Who did that to you?

1022
00:42:02,311 --> 00:42:04,729
- My brother.
- Your brother.

1023
00:42:04,855 --> 00:42:06,189
- It's no big deal.

1024
00:42:06,315 --> 00:42:07,482
It's nothing new,

1025
00:42:07,608 --> 00:42:09,526
except this time,
I hit him back.

1026
00:42:09,652 --> 00:42:11,069
- You guys need a new hobby.

1027
00:42:11,195 --> 00:42:12,654
- All families fight,
I guess.

1028
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:14,447
- Not mine,
not like that, anyway.

1029
00:42:14,573 --> 00:42:16,533
- There's always been plenty
of hand-to-hand combat

1030
00:42:16,659 --> 00:42:18,034
in our house.

1031
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:19,661
Me and my brother used to
stay up at nights

1032
00:42:19,787 --> 00:42:21,162
and listen to my parents.

1033
00:42:21,288 --> 00:42:22,914
We'd give them a number
on the temper scale.

1034
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:25,583
- My parents never raised
a hand to me,

1035
00:42:25,709 --> 00:42:29,045
fight with silence,
cold shoulder.

1036
00:42:29,171 --> 00:42:31,798
Well,
maybe that's worse.

1037
00:42:31,924 --> 00:42:33,424
- So you've never been hit?

1038
00:42:33,551 --> 00:42:35,260
- No.

1039
00:42:35,386 --> 00:42:37,053
- Not by anybody?

1040
00:42:37,179 --> 00:42:40,348
- No.

1041
00:42:40,474 --> 00:42:42,100
- Wow.

1042
00:42:42,226 --> 00:42:44,644
- I knew who you were,
you know.

1043
00:42:44,770 --> 00:42:46,354
I remembered you
from high school.

1044
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:48,690
- Why didn't you say something?

1045
00:42:48,816 --> 00:42:52,235
- I used to see you
in the halls,

1046
00:42:52,361 --> 00:42:56,447
cafeteria,
sometimes on the train,

1047
00:42:56,574 --> 00:42:59,117
always just watching everything.

1048
00:42:59,243 --> 00:43:01,452
And I used to-
I used to try to figure out,

1049
00:43:01,579 --> 00:43:02,787
"now,
what's this guy thinking?"

1050
00:43:02,913 --> 00:43:04,247
- Me too.

1051
00:43:04,373 --> 00:43:06,833
- I remember one time
in the school yard,

1052
00:43:06,959 --> 00:43:09,002
you were getting your ass kicked
by brother dominic.

1053
00:43:09,128 --> 00:43:10,461

- Mm-hmm.

1918
01:35:50,578 --> 01:35:52,662
- All the experience you got,
all the places you've been,

1919
01:35:52,788 --> 01:35:56,750
no problem.

1920
01:35:56,876 --> 01:35:59,586
- I never been anywhere,
brian.

1921
01:36:02,882 --> 01:36:07,177
Never really been out
of brooklyn,

1922
01:36:07,303 --> 01:36:10,597
and now I'll never get out.

1923
01:38:28,986 --> 01:38:30,528
- It's okay.

1924
01:38:30,654 --> 01:38:31,905
Come on out now.

1925
01:38:47,755 --> 01:38:49,464
You okay?

1926
01:38:49,590 --> 01:38:52,800
You're not scared anymore?

1927
01:38:52,927 --> 01:38:55,929
[Rattling noise]

1928
01:39:08,317 --> 01:39:09,484
- It's all right.

1929
01:39:09,610 --> 01:39:11,402
He got it out of his system.

1930
01:39:11,528 --> 01:39:13,321
Just make sure
you're both asleep

1931
01:39:13,447 --> 01:39:16,449
before he comes back.

1932
01:39:25,501 --> 01:39:27,168
You okay?

1933
01:39:34,677 --> 01:39:39,097
Can I...
Can I get you something?

1934
01:39:43,060 --> 01:39:44,602
- How's pop?

1935
01:39:44,728 --> 01:39:47,689
- Asleep.

1936
01:39:49,984 --> 01:39:52,986
- What is this?

1937
01:39:59,451 --> 01:40:01,536
- [Laughs]

1938

[Laughs]

1940
01:40:12,006 --> 01:40:14,632
When your brother was a kid,

1941
01:40:14,758 --> 01:40:15,967
we thought it would be
a good idea

1942
01:40:16,093 --> 01:40:19,345
to send him to summer camp.

1943
01:40:19,471 --> 01:40:22,056
You know,
let him get some fresh air,

1944
01:40:22,182 --> 01:40:23,891
trees,
things like that.

1945
01:40:24,018 --> 01:40:27,103
Your father saved up for it
all year,

1946
01:40:27,229 --> 01:40:30,440
but danny...

1947
01:40:30,566 --> 01:40:32,608
Danny didn't want to go.

1948
01:40:32,735 --> 01:40:35,737
No way.

1949
01:40:35,863 --> 01:40:39,741
Took him to the bus anyhow.

1950
01:40:39,867 --> 01:40:40,825
I was determined.

1951
01:40:40,951 --> 01:40:44,537
I-oh, he cried.

1952
01:40:44,663 --> 01:40:47,248
He-he-he held on to me.

1953
01:40:47,374 --> 01:40:49,917
He-he begged me
not to make him go.

1954
01:40:50,044 --> 01:40:52,086
He...

1955
01:40:52,212 --> 01:40:56,674
He even promised he'd be good
all summer.

1956
01:40:56,800 --> 01:41:00,928
So I took him back home.

1957
01:41:01,055 --> 01:41:04,474
I don't know if I did it
for him or for me,

1958
01:41:04,600 --> 01:41:10,396
but I couldn't bring myself
to put him on that bus,

1959
01:41:10,522 --> 01:41:14,442
and to this day,
I'm sorry I didn't.

1960
01:41:14,568 --> 01:41:18,613
It would have been so good
for him,

1961
01:41:18,739 --> 01:41:21,699
would have given him a chance
to see what he could do

1962
01:41:21,825 --> 01:41:24,077
out there in the world.

1963
01:41:27,915 --> 01:41:32,210
The thing is,
he wasn't strong enough to go.

1964
01:41:35,339 --> 01:41:38,716
And I should have been
strong enough to make him go.

1965
01:41:43,889 --> 01:41:47,016
- The stones come to brooklyn.

1966
01:41:47,142 --> 01:41:49,102
Pretty fucking stupid,
huh?

1967
01:41:49,228 --> 01:41:52,313
- Hey,
it could have happened.

1968
01:41:52,439 --> 01:41:55,441
- No, it couldn't.

1969
01:41:58,278 --> 01:42:01,531
- Think they'll ever
find whitey?

1970
01:42:01,657 --> 01:42:03,991
- I hope not.

1971
01:42:04,118 --> 01:42:06,077
He really pulled it off.

1972
01:42:06,203 --> 01:42:09,038
He rented all the equipment,
the whole nine yards.

1973
01:42:09,164 --> 01:42:12,917
Even jimmy cheeks thought
the stones were coming.

1974
01:42:13,043 --> 01:42:15,128
- Everybody's wondering
if you knew.

1975
01:42:15,254 --> 01:42:16,838
- No.

1976
01:42:16,964 --> 01:42:19,173
I probably should have,
but...

1977
01:42:19,299 --> 01:42:22,301
I always believed
everything he said.

1978
01:42:27,474 --> 01:42:30,184
Are you going back
to pittsburgh tomorrow?

1979
01:42:30,310 --> 01:42:33,896
- Yeah,
classes start next week, so...

1980
01:42:48,203 --> 01:42:49,537
- Yeah.

1981
01:42:49,663 --> 01:42:52,039
How long you think it will take
to get there?

[Both speaking indistinctly]

1983
01:43:35,584 --> 01:43:36,959
You all right?

1984
01:43:37,085 --> 01:43:39,253
- They even have travel agents
in pittsburgh?

1985
01:43:39,379 --> 01:43:40,922
- I wouldn't worry.

1986

people in pittsburgh

1987
01:43:42,549 --> 01:43:44,091

to draw pictures.

- Any good at it?

01:44:32,766 --> 01:44:34,517

need any money or anything?

2000

- No,
