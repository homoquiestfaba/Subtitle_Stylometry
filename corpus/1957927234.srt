1
00:00:18,252 --> 00:00:20,820
Nick. I'm telling
you, I'm telling you this story.

2
00:00:20,822 --> 00:00:22,588
It's gonna be big-it's
going to put me on the map.

3
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:24,389
It's going to get
national attention.

4
00:00:24,391 --> 00:00:27,225
And it's going to land me a job
in a real market.

5
00:00:27,227 --> 00:00:30,863
I didn't move from Nebraska to
live in some rinkie-dink Texas
town forever. Okay?

6
00:00:30,865 --> 00:00:33,902
I'm talking about a market like
Fort Worth or Chattanooga. Okay.

7
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:39,371
You'll see. Great, we should
probably show some respect,
though.

8
00:00:39,373 --> 00:00:41,807
I mean, people
died here right?

9
00:00:41,809 --> 00:00:44,409
People die everywhere
all the time.

10
00:00:44,411 --> 00:00:47,445
Okay? How do I look?

11
00:00:47,447 --> 00:00:48,683
You look great,
Ty. Let's go.

12
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:50,919
Yeah, I do look good.

13
00:00:53,487 --> 00:00:55,955
As you can see, I am standing
in front of this now

14
00:00:55,957 --> 00:00:58,026
infamous Texas home, the site of
Marie Strobeck's harrowing
escape

15
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:00,327
from a couple with
a taste for blood.

16
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:04,799
As was previously reported, the
wife and the couple was killed
in the escape.

17
00:01:06,433 --> 00:01:07,802
I kinda fucked that up.
Just take it from the top.

18
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:12,137
As you can see, I'm
standing in front of this now

19
00:01:12,139 --> 00:01:15,273
infamous Texas home,
the site of Marie Strobeck's

20
00:01:15,275 --> 00:01:16,744
harrowing escape from a
couple with a taste for blood.

21
00:01:18,947 --> 00:01:22,848
As was previously reported, the
wife of the duo was killed in
the escape attempt.

22
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:26,117
However, the father and a young
son of the duo still remain

23
00:01:26,119 --> 00:01:29,889
at large. As police begin
digging in the back of the
property.

24
00:01:29,891 --> 00:01:31,491
It is becoming apparent that
Marie was not the first person
to fall capture to the duo.

25
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:36,394
If you have any information as
to the whereabouts of the father

26
00:01:36,396 --> 00:01:38,066
or the son, we ask you to please
come forward to the authorities.

27
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:41,603
Until then, we will keep you
updated on this developing
story.

28
00:01:43,504 --> 00:01:45,506
I'm Ty Ziggler. This is your
local Channel three news.

29
00:01:47,942 --> 00:01:49,407
How was that?
I think we nailed it.

30
00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:51,476
Great, lunch?

31
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:14,028
Shit.

32
00:03:15,863 --> 00:03:17,863
How's it coming?
Not good.

33
00:03:17,865 --> 00:03:20,499
We don't have a spare. Shit.

34
00:03:20,501 --> 00:03:21,834
How much further?

35
00:03:21,836 --> 00:03:22,702
I don't know, man.

36
00:03:22,704 --> 00:03:25,305
Maybe an hour.
Hour and a half.

37
00:03:27,474 --> 00:03:29,110
What's wrong? Well we don't have
a spare, so we're just going to
have to

38
00:03:30,178 --> 00:03:31,577
sit here and wait.

39
00:03:31,579 --> 00:03:32,780
Get a ride from someone.

40
00:03:33,948 --> 00:03:34,916
That could be a while.

41
00:03:38,686 --> 00:03:41,089
How someone from over there,
they can probably help us out.

42
00:03:43,758 --> 00:03:45,423
Yeah, I guess.

43
00:03:45,425 --> 00:03:46,894
Yeah, come on, let's
go see who's home.

44
00:04:19,426 --> 00:04:22,393
I don't know about this place.
Huh?

45
00:04:22,395 --> 00:04:22,697
I don't feel good
about this place.

46
00:04:24,331 --> 00:04:24,699
Why? What's wrong?

47
00:04:26,801 --> 00:04:27,969
I don't know. It's just-I
just have a feeling.

48
00:04:34,142 --> 00:04:36,542
I'm sure we'll be out
of here right away.

49
00:04:36,544 --> 00:04:37,745
If you want to wait in the car,
you can, but we'll just be in
and out.

50
00:04:39,547 --> 00:04:41,647
No. That's okay.

51
00:04:41,649 --> 00:04:44,884
Hey. You got
me here. Okay?

52
00:04:44,886 --> 00:04:45,253
You've got nothing
to worry about.

53
00:04:59,133 --> 00:05:01,334
Hello. It's getting a
little wet out here.

54
00:05:07,041 --> 00:05:08,341
Well, should we just
head back to the car?

55
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:11,342
How can I help y'all?

56
00:05:11,344 --> 00:05:15,380
Um, yeah. Our car just broke
down, just down the road,

57
00:05:15,382 --> 00:05:16,416
and we're just wondering
if you would help us out at all.

58
00:05:18,186 --> 00:05:20,753
Ah well-I'd be happy to.

59
00:05:20,755 --> 00:05:22,555
I could take a look.

60
00:05:22,557 --> 00:05:25,356
And if I can't help, maybe we
can just make a quick call in
the town.

61
00:05:25,358 --> 00:05:27,092
Get a tow out here.

62
00:05:27,094 --> 00:05:29,929
Yeah, yeah,
that'd be great.

63
00:05:29,931 --> 00:05:32,731
Maybe I can get you all some
drinks. I just made some
lemonade

64
00:05:32,733 --> 00:05:34,101
and I'd be a terrible host if
I didn't offer you some.

65
00:05:35,536 --> 00:05:36,571
I could go for some lemonade.
That's great.

66
00:05:37,939 --> 00:05:38,573
Well, come on in.

67
00:05:41,275 --> 00:05:44,477
Maybe-maybe I should wait by the
car in case someone drives by.

68
00:05:46,781 --> 00:05:48,249
Ah-don't be ridiculous, it's
much more comfortable in here,

69
00:05:51,319 --> 00:05:52,019
I'm sure we'll be
quick. Alright?

70
00:05:52,887 --> 00:05:54,253
Exactly.

71
00:05:54,255 --> 00:05:59,694
You'll be back on
the road in no time.

72
00:06:24,285 --> 00:06:26,320
- Oh my god! Oh my god!
- Go! - Go!

73
00:06:31,692 --> 00:06:33,761
- What?
- Where are you.

74
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:55,214
Jane. Hey. Hey,
listen to me.

75
00:06:55,216 --> 00:06:57,583
We're going to be fine, all
right? We just have to find a
way out of here.

76
00:06:57,585 --> 00:06:59,486
They killed Rachel and Shaun!
Jane-listen to me!

77
00:07:00,688 --> 00:07:03,557
We're gonna die-Hey!

78
00:07:05,126 --> 00:07:06,193
We're not going
to die, Jane.

79
00:08:11,692 --> 00:08:13,461
Damn boy. That's
a good haul.

80
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:17,832
You look like your
mother right now.

81
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,254
Anything ell
can get for ya?

82
00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:44,358
Sir? More coffee.

83
00:08:47,194 --> 00:08:48,362
Sure.

84
00:08:51,766 --> 00:08:52,033
Anything else I
can grab for you?

85
00:09:11,419 --> 00:09:12,353
So how was the meal?

86
00:09:25,433 --> 00:09:26,100
It's cold.

87
00:09:30,404 --> 00:09:33,672
Yeah, but it seems as though
you haven't really touched
it.

88
00:09:33,674 --> 00:09:36,475
I just tried
it. It's cold.

89
00:09:36,477 --> 00:09:37,512
I get that. It's just that it
seems as though it's been
sitting there

90
00:09:38,679 --> 00:09:39,713
for so long-
I'd like to speak to a manager.

91
00:09:42,149 --> 00:09:42,983
Sure.

92
00:09:46,687 --> 00:09:47,755
My food is cold.

93
00:09:57,098 --> 00:09:58,699
Customers is
always right.

94
00:10:00,535 --> 00:10:01,268
Really?

95
00:10:04,238 --> 00:10:05,372
Order up!

96
00:10:15,983 --> 00:10:17,683
You can pay here
when you're done.

97
00:10:17,685 --> 00:10:19,787
Actually, your manager said
it'd be on the house.

98
00:10:22,423 --> 00:10:23,023
Hm.

99
00:11:11,438 --> 00:11:13,005
Maybe we should
try the radio again, huh?

100
00:11:13,007 --> 00:11:14,543
Horizon to Houston.

101
00:11:46,073 --> 00:11:48,510
Hello? Oh, hi, Mom.

102
00:11:50,077 --> 00:11:50,945
It's me.

103
00:11:54,616 --> 00:11:57,117
Mom. I-What?

104
00:12:01,989 --> 00:12:04,056
I'm just calling to see how you
were doing, how everyone was
doing.

105
00:12:04,058 --> 00:12:04,892
Fine.

106
00:12:07,962 --> 00:12:09,662
I've been saving up.

107
00:12:09,664 --> 00:12:12,364
I got a job at the diner
on fifth working nights,

108
00:12:12,366 --> 00:12:13,467
and-
so we're staying out of jail?

109
00:12:16,571 --> 00:12:20,272
Yeah. Hey. I was just.

110
00:12:20,274 --> 00:12:21,340
I just really
want to help.

111
00:12:21,342 --> 00:12:23,444
And... We don't need your help.

112
00:12:26,914 --> 00:12:28,015
Mom. I.

113
00:12:44,164 --> 00:12:46,733
Oh, welcome. There you are. Is
there anything I can get for you
today?

114
00:12:46,735 --> 00:12:47,468
Hi. Jenna.

115
00:12:48,703 --> 00:12:50,739
Jenna Olson. Right?

116
00:12:52,206 --> 00:12:55,807
Do I know you? Not yet.

117
00:12:55,809 --> 00:12:58,176
Don't worry you're okay.
I don't mean to freak you out.

118
00:12:58,178 --> 00:12:59,446
I just wanted to make sure
I had the right Jenna.

119
00:13:02,049 --> 00:13:03,217
Just take a seat
for a moment.

120
00:13:05,553 --> 00:13:06,521
Well, I'm on the clock, so I
don't think that's a very good
idea.

121
00:13:07,988 --> 00:13:10,525
Would a five figure paycheck
make it seem like a good idea?

122
00:13:14,161 --> 00:13:15,597
Come on. Just
have a seat.

123
00:13:16,864 --> 00:13:18,265
I'll be out of your
hair in a second.

124
00:13:25,472 --> 00:13:26,974
Okay. How's this sound?
You did some time.

125
00:13:28,409 --> 00:13:30,008
Got out for
good behavior.

126
00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:32,811
You're a burglar.

127
00:13:32,813 --> 00:13:34,248
Sound about right so far?

128
00:13:37,351 --> 00:13:39,019
Ah, if you're not
interested. Don't sweat it.

129
00:13:40,789 --> 00:13:42,456
I'll just order
off the menu.

130
00:13:45,426 --> 00:13:48,195
Yeah, okay I am... or I did.
You did what?

131
00:13:49,798 --> 00:13:50,998
If it was for a good cause.
Robin Hood eh?

132
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:55,033
Well, my brother was sick,
and it wasn't exactly cheap.

133
00:13:55,035 --> 00:13:55,637
Like working here?
Making enough money?

134
00:14:01,909 --> 00:14:03,778
You said something
about five figures.

135
00:14:15,189 --> 00:14:17,257
How's that sound?

136
00:14:18,626 --> 00:14:19,828
Is it legal?

137
00:14:22,196 --> 00:14:23,030
What do you think?

138
00:14:27,167 --> 00:14:28,636
Look, I'm getting
some people together.

139
00:14:30,204 --> 00:14:32,841
People don't want to ask
a lot of questions.

140
00:14:34,108 --> 00:14:35,710
You cooperate, you
get a nice paycheck.

141
00:14:38,379 --> 00:14:39,848
No, it's not legal.

142
00:14:42,149 --> 00:14:45,152
But the good news
is, it's quick, easy, clean.

143
00:14:47,254 --> 00:14:48,956
What the fuck is this?

144
00:14:51,826 --> 00:14:53,060
You ever see the movie
Ocean's 11 with Frank Sinatra?

145
00:14:55,295 --> 00:14:56,096
Well, it's kind
of like that.

146
00:14:57,898 --> 00:15:00,401
But, the point of all this
is, does it sound interesting?

147
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:08,041
Getting together with a few
friends and a couple of days on
Friday,

148
00:15:10,177 --> 00:15:12,379
we're going to meet here.

149
00:15:15,315 --> 00:15:16,818
It's a library. It's
going to be unlocked.

150
00:15:19,687 --> 00:15:20,822
I'm going to fill everybody
in on what I need.

151
00:15:22,891 --> 00:15:25,527
When it's all said and done,
everybody gets a nice paycheck.

152
00:15:29,129 --> 00:15:30,998
But if you're
happy working here

153
00:15:33,668 --> 00:15:36,437
don't sweat it.
She ya later, kid.

154
00:16:22,449 --> 00:16:24,951
That's quite the lighter.

155
00:16:24,953 --> 00:16:26,652
This was my brother's.

156
00:16:26,654 --> 00:16:27,622
You touch it and
I'll break your arm.

157
00:16:40,768 --> 00:16:41,168
Let me see that.

158
00:16:42,537 --> 00:16:44,169
Hm? These are easy. It's
all about knowing the pattern.

159
00:16:44,171 --> 00:16:44,906
Same thing every time.

160
00:16:46,173 --> 00:16:48,108
All right. Just line
these guys up and then.

161
00:16:50,812 --> 00:16:51,746
Pretty straightforward.
And then.

162
00:16:54,949 --> 00:16:57,585
Viola! Looks great.

163
00:16:59,253 --> 00:17:01,654
Wait-
Can we just jump into this.

164
00:17:01,656 --> 00:17:03,523
I mean, I think everybody
that's going to be here is here.

165
00:17:03,525 --> 00:17:05,092
Oh, there she
is. Come on in.

166
00:17:07,695 --> 00:17:08,663
It's good to see
you. Grab a seat.

167
00:17:14,101 --> 00:17:16,370
What is this? Well, let's
just say that I need all of you,

168
00:17:18,405 --> 00:17:22,307
and it's nice that
everybody showed up.

169
00:17:22,309 --> 00:17:24,512
So I looked over your case
histories, and everybody's got
criminal records.

170
00:17:26,213 --> 00:17:27,214
Getaway drivers, muscle,

171
00:17:29,283 --> 00:17:30,919
burglar.
How'd you get those records?

172
00:17:32,554 --> 00:17:36,022
Ah, the less you
know, the better.

173
00:17:36,024 --> 00:17:37,424
What I do know is that you guys
are all in good luck,

174
00:17:40,127 --> 00:17:42,964
all needing a paycheck, all
willing to ask as few questions
as possible.

175
00:17:43,965 --> 00:17:45,831
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Let's.

176
00:17:45,833 --> 00:17:47,200
So what exactly
are we doing?

177
00:17:49,637 --> 00:17:51,138
So in a couple of weeks,
there's a jewelry store,

178
00:17:53,975 --> 00:17:55,208
their cameras are going to be
down while they upgrade their
security systems.

179
00:17:57,077 --> 00:17:58,345
I need you all to go in
and clean the place out.

180
00:18:00,247 --> 00:18:01,783
I need all these hands to grab
as much as possible.

181
00:18:03,051 --> 00:18:04,686
Get out twice as quick.
What about alarms?

182
00:18:06,821 --> 00:18:08,888
Like I said, you'll be in and
out so quick it won't
matter.

183
00:18:08,890 --> 00:18:10,823
What happens after that?

184
00:18:10,825 --> 00:18:13,258
You go to a motel
outside of town.

185
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:15,293
I made a deal with
the motel manager.

186
00:18:15,295 --> 00:18:17,362
You guys will
change clothes,

187
00:18:17,364 --> 00:18:19,799
and wait there until
the heat is off.

188
00:18:19,801 --> 00:18:22,068
My associate will come
pick up the jewels,

189
00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:22,369
and you can all
go your merry way.

190
00:18:24,237 --> 00:18:26,074
Then when do we get paid?
On that day.

191
00:18:28,108 --> 00:18:29,443
You'll be paid
cash. No taxes.

192
00:18:30,845 --> 00:18:32,981
The jewels seem worth
more than what you're paying.

193
00:18:36,416 --> 00:18:37,986
Well, somebody decides to take
their own jewels to get a bigger
cut,

194
00:18:39,687 --> 00:18:40,622
their name finds their
way to the police.

195
00:18:42,489 --> 00:18:43,558
Not just your name

196
00:18:44,491 --> 00:18:46,391
everybody's name.

197
00:18:46,393 --> 00:18:47,427
That way, you're
all accountable to each other.

198
00:18:49,697 --> 00:18:52,100
So deal is my
money, or jail.

199
00:18:53,333 --> 00:18:55,501
What if we need
to reach you?

200
00:18:55,503 --> 00:18:57,536
Not going to happen. It's me to
you. The more you're in the
dark,

201
00:18:57,538 --> 00:18:59,204
fewer liabilities.

202
00:18:59,206 --> 00:19:00,742
Which brings us
to your names.

203
00:19:02,342 --> 00:19:04,242
Time to get acquainted.

204
00:19:04,244 --> 00:19:06,946
First, our drivers.

205
00:19:06,948 --> 00:19:10,785
Tessio. Frmhand. Likes to
boost cars once in a while.

206
00:19:13,021 --> 00:19:15,657
Carlo. Ex dirt
track race driver.

207
00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:18,356
Ex?

208
00:19:18,358 --> 00:19:19,861
They don't let me
compete anymore.

209
00:19:21,029 --> 00:19:21,994
Why's that?

210
00:19:21,996 --> 00:19:23,363
Too go.

211
00:19:25,265 --> 00:19:25,800
No other reason?

212
00:19:27,535 --> 00:19:29,068
I have done some
coke before races.

213
00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:31,103
Every race. Lotta coke.

214
00:19:31,105 --> 00:19:33,273
That make you go faster?
I felt like it.

215
00:19:35,076 --> 00:19:36,544
But if you're
worried or square.

216
00:19:38,846 --> 00:19:41,013
I chew gum instead now.
So are we done?

217
00:19:41,015 --> 00:19:44,950
Can we come back
to a meeting here?

218
00:19:44,952 --> 00:19:48,690
All right. Now, for those that
aren't behind the wheel, we have
Sonny.

219
00:19:51,291 --> 00:19:52,426
Considered one of the baddest
motherfuckers in the Midwest.

220
00:19:55,195 --> 00:19:56,229
I looked over his
records, and trust me,

221
00:19:58,198 --> 00:20:00,233
you want to stay
on his good side.

222
00:20:02,036 --> 00:20:04,269
Fredo. Man of many
connections, apparently.

223
00:20:04,271 --> 00:20:07,173
He's going to get
us what we need.

224
00:20:07,175 --> 00:20:09,711
Weapons. No serial numbers.
Cake.

225
00:20:12,113 --> 00:20:14,481
Tom. Did some time in the
military, knows his way around a
weapon or two.

226
00:20:16,249 --> 00:20:18,851
And Michael.
Young, inexperienced,

227
00:20:18,853 --> 00:20:20,655
a little sloppy, but
eager. I like that.

228
00:20:23,057 --> 00:20:23,290
That brings us to you.

229
00:20:25,325 --> 00:20:28,259
Kay. Burglar
extraordinaire.

230
00:20:28,261 --> 00:20:29,962
This woman has more
tools in her purse

231
00:20:29,964 --> 00:20:31,264
to get her in and out of places
than you could imagine.

232
00:20:33,167 --> 00:20:36,035
So those are names.
No real names.

233
00:20:36,037 --> 00:20:37,872
No point of contact,
no liabilities.

234
00:20:38,706 --> 00:20:39,574
Who's Fredo?

235
00:20:41,676 --> 00:20:43,709
You're Fredo.

236
00:20:43,711 --> 00:20:45,546
No. In the movie.
He's a character.

237
00:20:46,914 --> 00:20:48,850
Yes, but who plays him?
This is based off a movie?

238
00:20:49,684 --> 00:20:51,519
Guys, come on. Focus.

239
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:54,321
So, what's your name then?
Does it matter?

240
00:20:57,091 --> 00:20:59,390
Godmother?
Shouldn't it be God-Father?

241
00:20:59,392 --> 00:21:02,027
No. I'm your godmother.

242
00:21:02,029 --> 00:21:03,164
I'm going to make your wildest
dreams come true.

243
00:21:05,933 --> 00:21:08,366
Like I said, we only got a
couple of weeks to get ready for
this thing

244
00:21:08,368 --> 00:21:11,205
and I'll be in touch with all
of you for details and updates.

245
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:15,908
You're all going to be held
accountable for everything that
you hear today

246
00:21:15,910 --> 00:21:17,979
so if anybody gets a weak
stomach about this thing,

247
00:21:20,148 --> 00:21:22,382
I'm expecting all
of you to handle it.

248
00:21:23,985 --> 00:21:26,719
But it's not going to
come to that, right?

249
00:21:26,721 --> 00:21:30,089
Now. I'd like everybody
to stay out of trouble

250
00:21:30,091 --> 00:21:32,527
for the next couple of weeks.
But for for tonight-go home

251
00:21:34,796 --> 00:21:36,097
dream about what you're
going to do with your money.

252
00:21:54,314 --> 00:21:55,716
Hello. This is Tricia.
Please leave a message.

253
00:21:56,416 --> 00:21:56,951
Hey Mom.

254
00:21:59,053 --> 00:21:59,821
Sorry for calling
so late, I.

255
00:22:02,557 --> 00:22:04,523
I just wanted to let you know
that it would mean a lot to me

256
00:22:04,525 --> 00:22:05,259
if you'd let me help.

257
00:22:07,595 --> 00:22:09,362
And like I said, I'm sorry for
what I got mixed in before and

258
00:22:11,799 --> 00:22:13,500
it won't happen again.

259
00:22:17,705 --> 00:22:20,639
Okay. Well, call me
when you get this.

260
00:22:20,641 --> 00:22:21,609
Hopefully hear
from you soon.

261
00:22:25,112 --> 00:22:26,113
Really? You're
the hotel manager.

262
00:22:27,748 --> 00:22:30,883
Look, they just ask for a room.
I don't know what they're doing.

263
00:22:30,885 --> 00:22:31,984
I don't know where
they came from.

264
00:22:31,986 --> 00:22:32,718
I'm sorry, guys.

265
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:33,386
I can't help you.

266
00:22:54,041 --> 00:22:56,010
Hello.
Yeah, it's. Hello, it's Gary.

267
00:22:57,912 --> 00:22:59,313
You see, you can't stay
at the motel tomorrow.

268
00:23:00,848 --> 00:23:02,681
What do you mean I can't
use the motel tomorrow?

269
00:23:02,683 --> 00:23:05,117
Well, there's some
cops here as we speak.

270
00:23:05,119 --> 00:23:06,587
I think somebody was dealing
drugs out of one of the rooms.

271
00:23:08,923 --> 00:23:11,424
You know, honestly, I'm just
upset that I didn't know about
it beforehand.

272
00:23:12,827 --> 00:23:14,660
I mean, they should have been
cutting me in. Okay.

273
00:23:14,662 --> 00:23:15,462
What the hell am I
supposed to do now?

274
00:23:19,499 --> 00:23:22,735
You got a pen? Yeah.

275
00:23:22,737 --> 00:23:27,373
Yes. My parents owned a house
outside of town, and with them
now passed on,

276
00:23:27,375 --> 00:23:28,807
God rest their souls,

277
00:23:28,809 --> 00:23:30,475
the place is empty.

278
00:23:30,477 --> 00:23:31,712
Have your crew
stay there.

279
00:23:32,947 --> 00:23:34,048
What's the number?
I'm on the phone.

280
00:23:35,082 --> 00:23:37,082
What's the address?

281
00:23:37,084 --> 00:23:40,554
It's 2210 Elm Road,
just outside Devils Lake.

282
00:23:41,923 --> 00:23:42,788
I heard it was
an emergency.

283
00:23:42,790 --> 00:23:46,861
Will you wait? 2-2-1... 0?

284
00:23:48,229 --> 00:23:49,295
You know, they're going
to be really upset

285
00:23:49,297 --> 00:23:51,496
if you don't get all the
stuff down to- Seven!

286
00:23:51,498 --> 00:23:54,302
2217 Elm Road.

287
00:23:56,570 --> 00:23:58,436
Devils Lake,
North Dakota.

288
00:23:58,438 --> 00:24:00,973
That's right. Yeah.
I'll just swing by after work

289
00:24:00,975 --> 00:24:02,276
and leave the doors unlocked
for when they get there.

290
00:24:03,177 --> 00:24:04,777
All right, great.

291
00:24:04,779 --> 00:24:07,014
I'm still getting
my cut, right?

292
00:24:08,849 --> 00:24:10,483
Because I was looking forward
to replacing my countertops.

293
00:24:12,119 --> 00:24:15,056
You see, they remind me too
much of my mother. And I-No. 4%.

294
00:24:16,691 --> 00:24:19,925
Four? Four.

295
00:24:19,927 --> 00:24:21,095
I'm not going any
lower than six.

296
00:24:22,196 --> 00:24:25,030
Still four. Oh, okay.

297
00:24:25,032 --> 00:24:25,533
Yeah, yeah. Four is good.

298
00:24:27,768 --> 00:24:30,235
Just have them take their shoes
off when they're in the place.

299
00:24:30,237 --> 00:24:32,406
I don't really want them
to track dirt- Fuck.

300
00:25:26,861 --> 00:25:30,362
Hello?
Michael! It's your godfather.

301
00:25:30,364 --> 00:25:34,800
God, whatever. I need you to
relay an address to the crew

302
00:25:34,802 --> 00:25:36,969
and I can't get a
hold of anybody.

303
00:25:36,971 --> 00:25:39,004
Yeah, well, wait, wait, wait.
What's going on?

304
00:25:39,006 --> 00:25:40,606
There's too much
heat at the motel.

305
00:25:40,608 --> 00:25:42,374
There's something going on
with the police there.

306
00:25:42,376 --> 00:25:44,376
We have to
change locations.

307
00:25:44,378 --> 00:25:47,012
I made arrangements for a house
out in the country.

308
00:25:47,014 --> 00:25:50,015
Should be empty,
should be unlocked.

309
00:25:50,017 --> 00:25:51,252
You guys just lay low there
until the bag man shows up.

310
00:25:52,319 --> 00:25:55,187
All right? Yeah, for sure.

311
00:25:55,189 --> 00:26:00,094
Okay. Write down the address
2217 Elm Road.

312
00:26:01,530 --> 00:26:02,163
Devils Lake.
North Dakota.

313
00:26:05,132 --> 00:26:08,903
Got it? Yeah. 2217 Elm Road,
Devil's Lake, North Dakota.

314
00:26:10,539 --> 00:26:12,206
Make sure everybody shows up
at the right address. Clear?

315
00:26:13,574 --> 00:26:15,743
Crystal. Alright good.

316
00:26:43,437 --> 00:26:46,273
Yeah! Yeah! That's how you do
it! That's how you do it! Quick
and clean!

317
00:26:48,242 --> 00:26:50,309
Let's get to this motel.

318
00:26:50,311 --> 00:26:52,446
Wait, wait. Don't
go to the motel!

319
00:26:58,919 --> 00:27:00,285
What the hell
is going on?

320
00:27:00,287 --> 00:27:03,789
We're not going. The motel.
What?

321
00:27:03,791 --> 00:27:05,493
Godmother gave me a new address.
Some house on the country. I
don't know, motel was too hot.

322
00:27:06,961 --> 00:27:08,160
Godmother gave
this to you.

323
00:27:08,162 --> 00:27:11,363
Yeah. You're sure? Yes!

324
00:27:11,365 --> 00:27:13,866
Are you playing
us right now?

325
00:27:13,868 --> 00:27:16,301
Fine. Go to the motel.
And then pass go

326
00:27:16,303 --> 00:27:17,836
and head
straight to jail.

327
00:27:17,838 --> 00:27:19,273
Don't collect your money.

328
00:27:24,645 --> 00:27:26,413
All right. Got to
keep moving. Let's go.

329
00:27:33,954 --> 00:27:34,688
You got a weird
feeling about this?

330
00:27:35,356 --> 00:27:36,123
Nope.

331
00:28:15,162 --> 00:28:16,997
Hello?

332
00:30:04,104 --> 00:30:06,038
All right, grab the bags,

333
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:07,007
Get em' in the basement.
Park the cars over there.

334
00:31:53,313 --> 00:31:56,684
Michael brought us to some house
in the middle of nowhere.

335
00:31:58,820 --> 00:32:01,422
He said something
about issues at the motel.

336
00:32:02,590 --> 00:32:04,923
Yeah, I gave
Godmother the address.

337
00:32:04,925 --> 00:32:05,993
Just wait there until they
get in touch with you.

338
00:32:09,764 --> 00:32:11,597
You and Michael aren't
pulling anything, are you?

339
00:32:11,599 --> 00:32:14,099
I don't know
who Michael is.

340
00:32:14,101 --> 00:32:16,270
I don't even really know
who Godfather is- or godmother.

341
00:32:18,005 --> 00:32:19,306
Just please don't
track dirt in the.

342
00:32:27,549 --> 00:32:29,016
All right,
everyone, listen up.

343
00:32:30,919 --> 00:32:32,252
I just got off the phone
with the motel manager.

344
00:32:33,888 --> 00:32:36,722
Apparently, Michael was
telling the truth about there

345
00:32:36,724 --> 00:32:39,126
being too much
heat at the motel.

346
00:32:41,061 --> 00:32:43,629
So we're going
to lay low here

347
00:32:43,631 --> 00:32:45,798
till Godmother's associate
relieves us of the jewels.

348
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:48,534
Just like before.

349
00:32:48,536 --> 00:32:49,604
But we need to go over a
few things in the meantime.

350
00:32:51,405 --> 00:32:53,273
First of all, the jewels

351
00:32:55,175 --> 00:32:58,513
stay in the basement
in the closet until we leave.

352
00:33:00,815 --> 00:33:02,884
Period. In fact, don't
even go downstairs.

353
00:33:06,053 --> 00:33:07,387
If you see anyone
go downstairs.

354
00:33:08,756 --> 00:33:10,525
We have a problem. Second thing,

355
00:33:12,694 --> 00:33:15,060
no one goes out
of this house

356
00:33:15,062 --> 00:33:16,430
under any circumstance.

357
00:33:19,199 --> 00:33:22,367
We are keeping
a low profile.

358
00:33:22,369 --> 00:33:24,137
The only exception is
when we have a nightwatch.

359
00:33:25,405 --> 00:33:26,841
Is this also understood?

360
00:33:28,342 --> 00:33:30,377
Now, when night
does come,

361
00:33:32,479 --> 00:33:34,514
if you need to
get some sleep,

362
00:33:34,516 --> 00:33:36,649
there's a
bedroom upstairs,

363
00:33:36,651 --> 00:33:38,283
another one
around the corner,

364
00:33:38,285 --> 00:33:39,752
I really don't care

365
00:33:39,754 --> 00:33:41,756
as long as it's
not downstairs.

366
00:33:43,257 --> 00:33:46,592
Now I'm going to head up
and get some rest.

367
00:33:46,594 --> 00:33:48,061
I'll stay up overnight to make
sure no one goes near the
jewels.

368
00:33:50,732 --> 00:33:52,600
The look out can hold me
accountable, vice versa.

369
00:33:55,703 --> 00:33:57,404
But we can worry
about that more later.

370
00:33:59,974 --> 00:34:01,543
Is this clear
to everyone?

371
00:34:03,745 --> 00:34:06,948
So who put you in charge? What?

372
00:34:08,850 --> 00:34:09,784
You don't trust me?

373
00:34:11,084 --> 00:34:13,353
I don't even know you. Well

374
00:34:15,590 --> 00:34:16,423
looks like we got some time
to change all that, huh?

375
00:35:07,407 --> 00:35:10,676
So what are you gonna
spend your cut on?

376
00:35:10,678 --> 00:35:12,080
Um.

377
00:35:13,715 --> 00:35:15,783
My family. Oh, look at you.

378
00:35:17,819 --> 00:35:20,420
I'm probably going to get a
car, like, a really nice one.

379
00:35:22,657 --> 00:35:23,390
But I'll probably give
some to my family too,

380
00:35:25,192 --> 00:35:26,491
it's always the first
thing on my mind.

381
00:35:26,493 --> 00:35:29,196
Family is very important. Sure.

382
00:35:31,766 --> 00:35:35,166
Wow. You guys sure
know how to party.

383
00:35:35,168 --> 00:35:37,337
I mean, we're rich, and it's
about as exciting as a funeral
in here.

384
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:40,675
Well, we're not rich yet.
Yeah, but the hard part is over.

385
00:35:42,010 --> 00:35:44,378
We need to celebrate
a bit. Let loose.

386
00:35:48,082 --> 00:35:49,517
Anyone check the
freezer at all?

387
00:36:04,832 --> 00:36:06,801
Hey, look at that.

388
00:36:10,104 --> 00:36:12,573
If it looks
like whiskey and

389
00:36:14,575 --> 00:36:18,243
smells like whiskey.

390
00:36:18,245 --> 00:36:19,547
You know, I think
it's about time we got outside.

391
00:36:21,582 --> 00:36:23,151
If anyone wants to
join me, please do.

392
00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:27,318
Yeah, I'm pretty sure
you also heard the whole,

393
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:29,023
don't go outside, bit, Yeah?
That's right.

394
00:36:30,490 --> 00:36:32,024
He did say
that, didn't he?

395
00:36:32,026 --> 00:36:34,028
But last time I checked,
he wasn't in charge.

396
00:36:35,730 --> 00:36:38,498
Well, what if someone did, you
know, drive by and-some cops or
someone?

397
00:36:40,001 --> 00:36:43,135
What do you mean
if they drive by?

398
00:36:43,137 --> 00:36:45,673
We're just some nice folk
enjoying the great outdoors and
some whiskey.

399
00:36:47,441 --> 00:36:48,910
What could be more
harmless than that?

400
00:36:51,112 --> 00:36:52,912
Look, I think it's about time
we all got out there.

401
00:36:52,914 --> 00:36:53,948
Enjoy some fresh air.
Calm these nerves.

402
00:36:55,917 --> 00:36:56,818
I don't like doing it alone.
But don't think I won't.

403
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:01,321
And if Tom has a problem with
that, he can come tell me.

404
00:37:24,812 --> 00:37:26,914
That Tom guy's not
going to like this.

405
00:37:50,738 --> 00:37:51,672
You ever kill someone?

406
00:37:56,144 --> 00:37:58,611
What?
Come on. You're a criminal.

407
00:37:58,613 --> 00:38:00,081
Don't be offended.
No, I haven't.

408
00:38:01,849 --> 00:38:03,918
Well would you?
Kill someone? Yeah.

409
00:38:05,787 --> 00:38:06,888
You think you got
that killer instinct?

410
00:38:08,321 --> 00:38:11,123
Not a murderer. I didn't
say you were a murderer,

411
00:38:11,125 --> 00:38:12,260
I just want to know.
Would you ever pull the trigger?

412
00:38:14,494 --> 00:38:16,396
Let's say something goes wrong
or someone's in your way.

413
00:38:17,198 --> 00:38:17,598
It's you or them.

414
00:38:19,033 --> 00:38:19,432
Would you do it?

415
00:38:21,434 --> 00:38:22,503
I don't know.
Even if someone drew on you?

416
00:38:24,138 --> 00:38:26,272
I mean, probably.

417
00:38:26,274 --> 00:38:28,176
Probably? I doubt that.

418
00:38:30,645 --> 00:38:31,846
Have you ever
killed someone? No.

419
00:38:33,581 --> 00:38:35,948
But if I needed
to, I would.

420
00:38:35,950 --> 00:38:37,552
That easy? Sure.

421
00:38:39,486 --> 00:38:41,419
That's pretty cold.

422
00:38:41,421 --> 00:38:43,524
I don't think it's cold
as much as it is logical.

423
00:38:45,893 --> 00:38:46,794
You know, I don't think
it'd be that easy.

424
00:38:48,461 --> 00:38:49,362
Really? You
don't think so?

425
00:38:51,699 --> 00:38:52,898
Let's say you're in
this situation where it's

426
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:54,569
you or them. They kill you
unless you kill them.

427
00:38:57,038 --> 00:38:57,972
You don't think you wouldn't
hesitate to protect yourself?

428
00:39:01,876 --> 00:39:04,043
Dude.

429
00:39:04,045 --> 00:39:06,881
Relax. The safeties on.

430
00:39:10,117 --> 00:39:11,384
So would you shoot
me in that situation?

431
00:39:14,522 --> 00:39:17,056
Sure. It's fight or flight.

432
00:39:17,058 --> 00:39:18,958
It's in everyone.

433
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:21,394
You know, you're not very good
at something tough.

434
00:39:24,899 --> 00:39:25,867
Where is everyone?

435
00:39:27,467 --> 00:39:30,004
It was like Godfather Part one
and two, Conversation, Dog Days.

436
00:39:32,073 --> 00:39:33,639
I think it was
John something.

437
00:39:33,641 --> 00:39:34,242
I think you're right.

438
00:39:35,442 --> 00:39:37,543
Here comes Colin Powell.

439
00:39:37,545 --> 00:39:40,880
Great. He looks happy.

440
00:39:40,882 --> 00:39:42,482
You mind telling me what the
fuck you all doing out of the
house?

441
00:39:43,885 --> 00:39:44,919
I thought we could all
use some fresh air.

442
00:39:48,956 --> 00:39:51,090
You know, I thought
you look stupid,

443
00:39:51,092 --> 00:39:52,727
but at least now I know.

444
00:39:54,629 --> 00:39:56,130
Remember the whole point I made
about staying in the house?

445
00:39:57,865 --> 00:39:59,100
Once again. Remind me,

446
00:40:00,601 --> 00:40:02,069
who put you in charge? No one.

447
00:40:04,939 --> 00:40:06,274
I just don't want to see some
dumb ass fuck up a whole deal.

448
00:40:08,441 --> 00:40:09,610
Now, if everyone could
step in the house,

449
00:40:11,212 --> 00:40:12,747
that would be
much appreciated.

450
00:40:25,927 --> 00:40:28,062
You know, someone
of your age,

451
00:40:30,064 --> 00:40:31,565
I hear they're more susceptible
to heart attacks.

452
00:40:34,135 --> 00:40:36,535
You should calm down.

453
00:40:36,537 --> 00:40:37,772
You calling me old?

454
00:40:39,006 --> 00:40:39,941
Just looking out
for your health.

455
00:40:41,309 --> 00:40:42,576
I appreciate that.

456
00:40:44,512 --> 00:40:47,346
I think you should be looking
out for your own health.

457
00:40:47,348 --> 00:40:51,352
Is that supposed to be a threat?
No.

458
00:40:53,754 --> 00:40:55,323
That is no threat.

459
00:40:56,157 --> 00:40:57,923
That is a promise.

460
00:41:00,394 --> 00:41:04,298
Wow. That is
super original.

461
00:41:07,201 --> 00:41:09,001
What movie did you
hear that from?

462
00:41:09,003 --> 00:41:10,338
Get in the house.

463
00:41:11,772 --> 00:41:15,343
I will. On my own time.

464
00:41:18,446 --> 00:41:20,314
You think you're funny? No.

465
00:41:22,950 --> 00:41:25,353
I think George
Carlin is funny.

466
00:41:37,064 --> 00:41:41,469
I'm going to need you to calm
down and take your hand off the
gun.

467
00:41:44,205 --> 00:41:45,339
Now stand up.

468
00:41:51,479 --> 00:41:53,080
Get in the house.

469
00:41:55,082 --> 00:41:58,953
All right, everyone,
you heard the man.

470
00:42:40,795 --> 00:42:42,229
Alright.

471
00:42:43,764 --> 00:42:44,298
So here's the deal.

472
00:42:47,401 --> 00:42:48,235
I'm going to sit
right here all night.

473
00:42:51,972 --> 00:42:53,474
Looks like we need to make sure
no one goes down stairs.

474
00:42:57,111 --> 00:42:59,213
Tessio's been so kind to
volunteer to stay up and be our
first lookout.

475
00:43:01,082 --> 00:43:04,285
Oh, I did?
You needed some fresh air.

476
00:43:07,588 --> 00:43:10,122
Can I at least
get my gun back?

477
00:43:10,124 --> 00:43:11,657
The one you tried
to pull on me?

478
00:43:11,659 --> 00:43:13,528
Yeah, that one. Don't worry.

479
00:43:15,062 --> 00:43:16,829
I'll look out for you.

480
00:43:16,831 --> 00:43:18,466
You're too considerate.

481
00:43:22,436 --> 00:43:23,836
Now someone else
needs to relieve.

482
00:43:23,838 --> 00:43:25,773
Tessio, say, around two.

483
00:43:28,209 --> 00:43:30,976
Who else is out there
with our friend?

484
00:43:30,978 --> 00:43:32,279
Sonny? You needed
some fresh air, right?

485
00:43:34,181 --> 00:43:35,149
You can get some
more tonight.

486
00:43:36,050 --> 00:43:37,751
Everyone get some rest.

487
00:43:39,487 --> 00:43:41,556
Hopefully we are
relieved tomorrow.

488
00:43:56,871 --> 00:43:57,371
Christ.

489
00:44:28,769 --> 00:44:30,838
Uh, you're up, man.

490
00:45:41,275 --> 00:45:43,545
Hey. Hey sunshine!

491
00:45:45,647 --> 00:45:46,581
I'm gonna take
your bag off

492
00:45:48,617 --> 00:45:50,516
and if you don't
stop squirming, I'm

493
00:45:50,518 --> 00:45:56,121
going to cut your throat.

494
00:46:01,663 --> 00:46:02,863
What are you doing in our home?
Your home?

495
00:46:04,699 --> 00:46:09,868
Are you the motel
owner? What? Help!

496
00:46:14,108 --> 00:46:15,276
If you don't want
to die right here,

497
00:46:17,411 --> 00:46:19,044
best keep it down.

498
00:46:19,046 --> 00:46:20,345
Nobody can hear you
out here anyway.

499
00:46:20,347 --> 00:46:21,583
Dumb motherfucker.

500
00:46:23,718 --> 00:46:25,652
What are you
doing in our home?

501
00:46:25,654 --> 00:46:26,420
I'll try it again.

502
00:46:28,856 --> 00:46:29,990
Just laying low, man.
Laying low from whom?

503
00:46:31,859 --> 00:46:33,726
The police. For what?

504
00:46:33,728 --> 00:46:35,129
A robbery.

505
00:46:36,964 --> 00:46:39,701
What did you steal? I don't
think I should be telling you
that.

506
00:46:41,068 --> 00:46:42,602
I don't care one
way or the other.

507
00:46:42,604 --> 00:46:43,904
So what you're
telling me is

508
00:46:45,439 --> 00:46:46,874
that you all are
hiding out here

509
00:46:49,376 --> 00:46:51,843
and nobody knows
you're there.

510
00:46:51,845 --> 00:46:53,981
Yeah, I think
that's the point.

511
00:46:56,718 --> 00:46:57,885
Say you look like
you're from around here,

512
00:46:58,753 --> 00:46:59,686
where are you from?

513
00:46:59,688 --> 00:47:02,489
Brazil.
Brazil? You're that boy?!

514
00:47:04,158 --> 00:47:05,859
Brazilian barbecue.

515
00:48:43,123 --> 00:48:46,861
Tom... TOM!

516
00:48:48,462 --> 00:48:50,962
I'm not sleeping.

517
00:48:50,964 --> 00:48:53,835
How's the watch going?
Quiet enough.

518
00:49:05,179 --> 00:49:05,814
Hello?!

519
00:49:12,854 --> 00:49:14,321
Hey, who's on
watch right now?

520
00:49:17,191 --> 00:49:18,225
Should be Sonny.

521
00:49:19,226 --> 00:49:20,461
Yeah. No, he's not there.

522
00:49:34,374 --> 00:49:35,375
Sonny!

523
00:49:40,515 --> 00:49:41,148
Get the others up.

524
00:50:13,882 --> 00:50:14,381
Sonny!

525
00:50:42,710 --> 00:50:44,877
We didn't have
any luck either.

526
00:50:44,879 --> 00:50:46,313
Should we leave or-?
Where would he go?

527
00:50:48,683 --> 00:50:50,415
I mean, he didn't
take any of the jewels, right?

528
00:50:50,417 --> 00:50:52,685
No. It's all there.

529
00:50:52,687 --> 00:50:54,452
He wouldn't turn
us in, would he?

530
00:50:54,454 --> 00:50:55,690
If he did, I assume the police
or someone would be here
already.

531
00:50:57,926 --> 00:51:00,593
And I don't know why he would
do something like that do you?

532
00:51:00,595 --> 00:51:01,729
I think we should leave.
And go where?

533
00:51:02,730 --> 00:51:05,163
What's the plan then?

534
00:51:05,165 --> 00:51:07,602
I don't know. I just think we
should be prepared to leave if
need be.

535
00:51:08,870 --> 00:51:10,237
No, the plan is to
stay here until relieved.

536
00:51:11,839 --> 00:51:13,373
Well, maybe one of
us takes a drive,

537
00:51:14,943 --> 00:51:16,611
splits off from the rest of us
sees if they can find Sonny.

538
00:51:24,586 --> 00:51:28,353
I'll do it. Jewels
can stay here

539
00:51:28,355 --> 00:51:28,890
I'll be right back.

540
00:51:48,977 --> 00:51:50,710
My car won't start.

541
00:51:50,712 --> 00:51:52,647
What do you mean,
your car won't start?

542
00:52:11,766 --> 00:52:14,134
You look worried. Well, I'm not.

543
00:52:16,169 --> 00:52:18,906
Look. Someone messed
with it. See here?

544
00:52:21,943 --> 00:52:23,778
Okay. Come with me.

545
00:52:34,622 --> 00:52:36,989
Seems like someone
tampered with this car.

546
00:52:36,991 --> 00:52:39,424
Now she won't run.

547
00:52:39,426 --> 00:52:40,795
What? Maybe Sonny
messed with the engine,

548
00:52:42,864 --> 00:52:45,665
but he didn't
go downstairs.

549
00:52:45,667 --> 00:52:47,867
He didn't take
any of the jewels.

550
00:52:47,869 --> 00:52:48,636
So far, he doesn't
appear he's ratted us out.

551
00:52:50,838 --> 00:52:52,006
So maybe it's not Sonny
we need to worry about.

552
00:52:53,675 --> 00:52:56,274
Did anybody see
anything last night?

553
00:52:56,276 --> 00:52:57,578
I think we need to leave.
And once again, go where?

554
00:52:59,647 --> 00:53:01,881
Risk getting arrested
or a car spotted?

555
00:53:01,883 --> 00:53:03,216
If we need fresh vehicles,
will hijack some that pass by.

556
00:53:04,519 --> 00:53:05,553
No, this is already
becoming a mess.

557
00:53:07,021 --> 00:53:08,754
We don't need to attract
more attention to us.

558
00:53:08,756 --> 00:53:11,824
- It'll be easy.
- No.

559
00:53:11,826 --> 00:53:13,528
Maybe we should call the hotel,
see if they've heard from
Godmother?

560
00:53:18,398 --> 00:53:20,068
Yeah-fuck.

561
00:53:40,021 --> 00:53:44,322
So? Nah, it appears
someone cut the phone cord.

562
00:53:44,324 --> 00:53:46,627
You got to be fucking
kidding me. It's not working.

563
00:53:56,070 --> 00:53:57,138
Did you notice
this at any point?

564
00:53:58,539 --> 00:53:59,905
No.

565
00:53:59,907 --> 00:54:01,441
Well that's great.

566
00:54:08,983 --> 00:54:10,683
I got a bad
feeling about this.

567
00:54:10,685 --> 00:54:12,352
How long has it been cut?

568
00:54:14,088 --> 00:54:15,523
I don't know.
Well, did Sonny cut it?

569
00:54:16,624 --> 00:54:20,061
If not him-someone here did.

570
00:54:23,831 --> 00:54:25,798
Look, I'm going
to try my car

571
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:28,266
and take a look around and see
if I can find Sonny or
something.

572
00:54:28,268 --> 00:54:30,736
Why would we let you leave
with the only working car?

573
00:54:30,738 --> 00:54:33,873
Look, man, if you want to take
the car, drive around by
yourself

574
00:54:33,875 --> 00:54:34,842
looking for Sonny.
Be my fucking guest.

575
00:54:37,512 --> 00:54:38,478
All right? I'll stay here with
the jewels and everyone else.

576
00:54:42,382 --> 00:54:43,416
Be quick.

577
00:54:45,887 --> 00:54:46,554
If you're
pulling anything,

578
00:54:48,723 --> 00:54:49,724
or you're associated
with anyone that is

579
00:54:52,126 --> 00:54:56,095
you and me are going
to have a problem.

580
00:54:56,097 --> 00:54:59,867
Look man, I want to get out of
here as bad as you. I hope so.

581
00:55:23,191 --> 00:55:25,293
Everyone get back inside.

582
00:55:26,393 --> 00:55:28,461
We wait til
Tessio gets back.

583
00:55:34,569 --> 00:55:35,835
You wouldn't happen
to know anything I don't,

584
00:55:35,837 --> 00:55:37,903
do you?

585
00:55:37,905 --> 00:55:40,241
I'm just as
concerned as you are.

586
00:55:41,474 --> 00:55:42,276
I bet.

587
00:56:08,703 --> 00:56:12,974
What the hell?

588
00:56:50,845 --> 00:56:54,849
Hey. Whoever this is, whatever's
going on, you're not involved,
right?

589
00:56:56,584 --> 00:56:58,119
No, I'm not involved.

590
00:57:00,221 --> 00:57:02,823
I mean, even if I was,
why would I tell you?

591
00:57:04,625 --> 00:57:06,158
If this goes south,

592
00:57:06,160 --> 00:57:08,195
whatever this is,
we need to stick together.

593
00:57:10,765 --> 00:57:12,800
And why should I trust you?
Good point.

594
00:57:15,435 --> 00:57:16,637
But when you're out of options,
you're going to have to trust
someone.

595
00:57:19,106 --> 00:57:20,775
You got something
you want to share with us?

596
00:57:22,677 --> 00:57:24,645
I'm good. Why don't we go out to
the entryway to keep each other
company.

597
00:57:27,315 --> 00:57:28,849
Til Tessio gets back.

598
00:57:29,951 --> 00:57:31,619
Sure, yeah.
It's funny for.

599
00:57:34,789 --> 00:57:35,455
Sonny!

600
00:58:07,487 --> 00:58:10,391
Well, this is fun.

601
00:58:23,404 --> 00:58:24,505
Why don't you
take a picture?

602
00:58:26,507 --> 00:58:30,909
That's okay. Say you're the
one who brought us here, right?

603
00:58:30,911 --> 00:58:34,446
Yeah. That's what
I was told to do.

604
00:58:34,448 --> 00:58:36,715
Anyone think
that's funny,

605
00:58:36,717 --> 00:58:38,152
that you're the only one
godmother talked to?

606
00:58:39,587 --> 00:58:41,455
He's on the level.
I talked to the motel manager.

607
00:58:42,523 --> 00:58:44,623
Well, guess what?

608
00:58:44,625 --> 00:58:46,193
No one else here can vouch for
the both of you are saying.

609
00:58:48,496 --> 00:58:50,898
I mean, whatever is
happening right now,

610
00:58:53,334 --> 00:58:56,201
somebody is up
to something.

611
00:58:56,203 --> 00:58:57,304
I don't think
authorities are involved.

612
00:58:59,807 --> 00:59:01,907
Maybe Godmother's
ripping us off,

613
00:59:01,909 --> 00:59:04,476
or maybe it's one of us.

614
00:59:04,478 --> 00:59:07,681
Right now, we need
to stick together.

615
00:59:09,583 --> 00:59:11,652
We need trust. I'm not
about to trust anyone here.

616
00:59:12,853 --> 00:59:14,286
What are you
trying to say?

617
00:59:14,288 --> 00:59:15,489
I'm just saying I don't want
to get ripped off.

618
00:59:17,691 --> 00:59:21,693
And I assume that feeling is
mutual. Trust is what's going to
get us through this.

619
00:59:21,695 --> 00:59:24,863
Trust is for fools. Fine.

620
00:59:24,865 --> 00:59:28,367
Don't trust me. But stop staring
at me like you've got a problem.

621
00:59:28,369 --> 00:59:32,505
What? Paranoid? No. I just have
a basic understanding of
manners.

622
00:59:32,507 --> 00:59:34,306
You're saying I don't?

623
00:59:34,308 --> 00:59:36,742
What I'm saying is, if there's
anyone here that I don't like,
it's you.

624
00:59:36,744 --> 00:59:38,511
Then you should
do something.

625
00:59:38,513 --> 00:59:41,182
Can you guys just lay off
each other for 2 minutes?

626
00:59:43,117 --> 00:59:44,785
We're all on the same team.
Hopefully.

627
00:59:47,655 --> 00:59:49,688
Why don't you
take his gun, too?

628
00:59:49,690 --> 00:59:53,959
Just to be safe. Over
my dead body. Okay.

629
00:59:53,961 --> 00:59:57,298
Stop! Both of
you, calm down.

630
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:03,572
I'm just saying I'd feel a lot
more comfortable if I had my gun
back.

631
01:00:05,005 --> 01:00:07,007
Yeah, well, I
wouldn't. Now, shut up.

632
01:00:14,081 --> 01:00:14,915
What the fuck?

633
01:00:16,150 --> 01:00:18,352
Ah! Shit! Shit!

634
01:00:21,322 --> 01:00:23,224
Fuck. Fuck!

635
01:00:30,599 --> 01:00:31,600
Help!

636
01:00:42,009 --> 01:00:45,412
Alfredo! Carlo!

637
01:01:02,029 --> 01:01:04,999
Oh. Shit. What? I
think my gun is missing.

638
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,133
Your gun is missing?

639
01:01:08,135 --> 01:01:09,203
Yeah. Somebody must
have lifted it.

640
01:01:10,404 --> 01:01:12,572
You lost your gun?

641
01:01:12,574 --> 01:01:13,774
Maybe Sonny took it.

642
01:01:14,708 --> 01:01:17,442
I need to find my gun.

643
01:01:17,444 --> 01:01:20,445
I'm keeping my eyes
on everyone right now.

644
01:01:20,447 --> 01:01:22,149
Don't worry.
I've got mine.

645
01:01:25,686 --> 01:01:27,254
You feel kind of
naked now, huh?

646
01:02:46,834 --> 01:02:48,834
They should have
been back by now.

647
01:02:48,836 --> 01:02:51,138
Where are they? You need to
keep your cool. I'm out of gum.

648
01:02:53,307 --> 01:02:54,306
I want my cut.
I'm out of here.

649
01:02:54,308 --> 01:02:56,775
Me too. Shut up.

650
01:02:56,777 --> 01:02:59,011
And no you're not,
out of the question.

651
01:02:59,013 --> 01:03:01,516
It's my choice. It's not
your choice, we are a group,

652
01:03:03,417 --> 01:03:05,352
and I'm not about to let you
jeopardize this group.

653
01:03:06,854 --> 01:03:09,021
Are you kidding me?

654
01:03:09,023 --> 01:03:09,823
We need to wait till
Tessio gets back.

655
01:03:13,794 --> 01:03:15,329
This is getting
ridiculous.

656
01:03:18,165 --> 01:03:19,601
I need to get out
of this house.

657
01:03:22,637 --> 01:03:26,675
Hey. Sit down.
God damn it!

658
01:03:28,409 --> 01:03:29,544
Everyone stay put.

659
01:03:33,247 --> 01:03:34,248
You were the big
guy. Stay put.

660
01:03:36,283 --> 01:03:37,316
Where are you going?

661
01:03:37,318 --> 01:03:38,852
Getting my share.

662
01:03:41,790 --> 01:03:45,223
Back in the house. And do what?

663
01:03:45,225 --> 01:03:47,794
We need to calm down
and stick to a plan.

664
01:03:47,796 --> 01:03:50,862
And what plan is
that going to be?

665
01:03:50,864 --> 01:03:53,832
I don't know yet
but we need to keep our heads.

666
01:03:53,834 --> 01:03:56,001
What if Fredo was right?

667
01:03:56,003 --> 01:03:58,136
What if Michael
is in on it?

668
01:03:58,138 --> 01:03:59,073
What if he's not?

669
01:04:04,178 --> 01:04:06,380
Maybe you are. You need
to calm down real quick.

670
01:04:13,253 --> 01:04:18,959
You've gotta be kidding me.
Hey, stop!

671
01:04:20,494 --> 01:04:21,730
What do you think
you're doing?

672
01:04:24,064 --> 01:04:26,266
I trust myself more
than I trust any of you.

673
01:04:27,802 --> 01:04:30,135
I'm just taking my cut
and going my own way.

674
01:04:30,137 --> 01:04:31,004
I suggest you
all do the same.

675
01:04:33,541 --> 01:04:35,273
You keeping us
in the house,

676
01:04:35,275 --> 01:04:36,410
is beginning to look more
and more like a death sentence.

677
01:04:37,878 --> 01:04:40,682
I'm not going back.
Last warning.

678
01:04:47,221 --> 01:04:49,323
You know what?
Maybe you're right.

679
01:04:51,425 --> 01:04:54,426
Maybe I should go
back in the house.

680
01:04:54,428 --> 01:04:56,230
Take your cut as well, since
you're hell bent on throwing
yours into the wind.

681
01:04:57,665 --> 01:04:59,297
Big threat from a
man with no gun.

682
01:04:59,299 --> 01:05:02,234
Take it easy! That's right.

683
01:05:02,236 --> 01:05:04,236
You're going to
shoot an unarmed man?

684
01:05:04,238 --> 01:05:05,239
If you're smart,
you'll go back in the house.

685
01:05:06,608 --> 01:05:07,776
Let us take our
cuts and leave.

686
01:05:09,076 --> 01:05:10,277
We are not
discussing this.

687
01:05:11,746 --> 01:05:14,346
Everyone better pick
a side right now.

688
01:05:14,348 --> 01:05:16,618
We are not picking sides!

689
01:05:18,318 --> 01:05:19,687
3 seconds to get
back in the house.

690
01:05:47,347 --> 01:05:48,482
Kay, throw your
gun to the side.

691
01:05:56,957 --> 01:05:59,426
Michael, you really shouldn't
leave your weapon laying around.

692
01:06:02,797 --> 01:06:04,198
All right. You two
have seemed pretty chummy.

693
01:06:06,033 --> 01:06:07,968
Let's get you inside
and see what you know.

694
01:06:17,311 --> 01:06:18,680
For the last time,

695
01:06:20,180 --> 01:06:21,948
you mind telling
me what's going on?

696
01:06:21,950 --> 01:06:23,150
Or, maybe your
girlfriend does.

697
01:06:25,452 --> 01:06:27,488
I've seen you two talk and the
whole fucking time.
Meh-meh-meh-meh-meh.

698
01:06:30,357 --> 01:06:31,891
You know each
other before this?

699
01:06:31,893 --> 01:06:33,693
I don't know anything.

700
01:06:33,695 --> 01:06:35,695
I have never met
this man before.

701
01:06:35,697 --> 01:06:37,431
Get me out of this chair.

702
01:06:39,399 --> 01:06:41,034
I say we just
get out of here.

703
01:06:45,940 --> 01:06:48,308
All right, let's get the bags.
Yeah.

704
01:06:55,950 --> 01:06:58,118
Darling, can I get a kiss for
the road? I'll take it.

705
01:07:31,819 --> 01:07:34,187
All right. Next car that
comes by, we'll take.

706
01:07:35,255 --> 01:07:35,690
After that

707
01:07:38,125 --> 01:07:39,892
you can find me
in the Bahamas.

708
01:07:39,894 --> 01:07:40,862
Sounds good to me.

709
01:07:47,501 --> 01:07:50,505
Man, that is a
lot of jewelry.

710
01:07:53,741 --> 01:07:54,274
And split two ways

711
01:07:56,511 --> 01:07:58,278
that ain't bad. No, it's not.

712
01:08:15,964 --> 01:08:19,634
God damn it.

713
01:08:26,139 --> 01:08:27,140
You okay there, Tessio?

714
01:08:30,578 --> 01:08:32,410
I think my
name was Carlo.

715
01:08:32,412 --> 01:08:36,249
Oh, right.

716
01:08:55,168 --> 01:08:59,741
Ow, ow, ow. Oh! Ow! Oh!

717
01:09:11,485 --> 01:09:13,554
Did you hear that? Yep.

718
01:09:46,621 --> 01:09:51,092
Hey. Over here. I'm hurt.

719
01:10:04,005 --> 01:10:06,007
It's fine. I'll
come to you.

720
01:11:04,098 --> 01:11:05,533
Wait!

721
01:11:08,035 --> 01:11:11,172
Fredo was played
by John Cazale.

722
01:11:20,715 --> 01:11:21,816
I think we should go.

723
01:11:22,750 --> 01:11:23,684
Good plan.

724
01:11:54,115 --> 01:11:55,482
The coast is
clear!

725
01:11:58,186 --> 01:11:59,253
Howdy, bitch.
Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait!

726
01:12:10,798 --> 01:12:13,668
Ahaha! Woo!

727
01:15:01,535 --> 01:15:03,337
Why don't youcome
downstairs?

728
01:15:04,705 --> 01:15:06,440
You're just making it
harder on yourself.

729
01:19:56,130 --> 01:19:57,632
Don't move!

730
01:19:59,800 --> 01:20:01,567
Are you a godfather?

731
01:20:01,569 --> 01:20:05,103
Godmother? Whatever.

732
01:20:05,105 --> 01:20:07,875
Yeah. I'm Kay. Are
you the bag man? Yeah.

733
01:20:15,717 --> 01:20:16,584
Can we please leave?

734
01:20:20,154 --> 01:20:24,856
The official body count around
the property in Devils Lake has
risen

735
01:20:24,858 --> 01:20:29,798
to eight, authorities describing
it as a massacre with no clear
explanation.

736
01:20:31,465 --> 01:20:34,933
The victims are all males
suffering from a mix of bullet

737
01:20:34,935 --> 01:20:37,338
and stab wounds,
as well as blunt force trauma.

738
01:20:38,872 --> 01:20:42,307
If one thing is for certain
what ever occurred

739
01:20:42,309 --> 01:20:43,812
on that property,
it could not have been good.

740
01:20:45,446 --> 01:20:46,914
Up next, sports.
Stay tuned.
