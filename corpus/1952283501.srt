1
00:03:41,607 --> 00:03:43,107
Where's the rest of it?

2
00:03:44,207 --> 00:03:45,879
Somewhere where
you'll never find it.

3
00:06:56,047 --> 00:06:57,547
Hey Joe, are you coming?

4
00:06:58,487 --> 00:06:59,987
Come on, man.

5
00:07:03,327 --> 00:07:05,283
- Hey, Joe.
- Beer coming!

6
00:07:08,807 --> 00:07:10,684
And he catches it and
the fans are going wild!

7
00:07:10,887 --> 00:07:12,387
Babe.

8
00:07:14,127 --> 00:07:16,436
Where do you think you're going, sir?

9
00:07:17,567 --> 00:07:19,067
- Little place called home.
- Oh, no.

10
00:07:20,447 --> 00:07:21,726
No!

11
00:07:21,727 --> 00:07:24,161
You were trying to get away...

12
00:07:24,367 --> 00:07:26,597
from the hump night party.

13
00:07:27,607 --> 00:07:29,107
Yeah, guys, I think
I'm going to miss the...

14
00:07:29,207 --> 00:07:31,641
"sit around-complain about women-get
drunk-puking all night-thing".

15
00:07:31,847 --> 00:07:32,926
All right, I'll be up here.

16
00:07:32,927 --> 00:07:35,885
It's time to party for the crowd!

17
00:07:36,087 --> 00:07:37,587
Party!

18
00:07:38,327 --> 00:07:40,318
Come on, guys.
You know I hate these parties.

19
00:07:40,527 --> 00:07:42,597
Look, it's time to get over that,
you know what I'm saying?

20
00:07:43,047 --> 00:07:44,486
- You know what his problem is?
- What?

21
00:07:44,487 --> 00:07:46,478
- You have no vices.
- What are you talking about?

22
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:48,325
I've got plenty of vices.
I've got vices.

23
00:07:48,527 --> 00:07:50,027
Show what a vice is.

24
00:07:52,607 --> 00:07:54,107
Yeah.

25
00:07:54,247 --> 00:07:55,747
Now that's a vice.

26
00:07:57,767 --> 00:07:59,322
That had to have hurt.

27
00:07:59,567 --> 00:08:00,686
It did, kind of.

28
00:08:00,687 --> 00:08:01,926
You're a knucklehead.

29
00:08:01,927 --> 00:08:05,442
Let's go to the hump night party!

30
00:08:05,647 --> 00:08:07,086
Let's party and be merry.

31
00:08:07,087 --> 00:08:10,523
I know a couple of bettys...

32
00:08:10,727 --> 00:08:13,161
that are great for you, bud.

33
00:08:24,087 --> 00:08:26,760
Oh my God!

34
00:08:27,247 --> 00:08:28,646
She's checking you out!

35
00:08:28,647 --> 00:08:30,205
- She's looking at you, man.
- You think so?

36
00:08:30,407 --> 00:08:32,682
She's definitely looking at you.

37
00:08:33,407 --> 00:08:36,763
- No, I think she's looking at Stu.
- She wasn't, she was looking at you.

38
00:08:36,967 --> 00:08:38,639
She was looking at you, man.
Make the move.

39
00:08:40,687 --> 00:08:42,187
Make the move!

40
00:08:43,647 --> 00:08:44,966
Oh, man. Here we go.

41
00:08:44,967 --> 00:08:47,435
She's not looking at me, okay?
The girl's not looking at me.

42
00:08:48,607 --> 00:08:51,679
Right, you know ever since
Caroline dumped you,

43
00:08:51,887 --> 00:08:52,886
man.

44
00:08:52,887 --> 00:08:54,246
The girl is not looking at me,
okay?

45
00:08:54,247 --> 00:08:56,078
You've lost your balls, Joe.

46
00:08:56,927 --> 00:08:59,157
Let's get something straight.
Caroline did not dump me, okay?

47
00:08:59,367 --> 00:09:00,959
Yes she did. Yes she did.

48
00:09:01,167 --> 00:09:03,283
No she did not, all right?

49
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:06,604
Second of all, my name is Joseph,
okay? Joseph.

50
00:09:07,207 --> 00:09:09,846
Joseph... Joseph.

51
00:09:10,047 --> 00:09:11,286
Come on.

52
00:09:11,287 --> 00:09:13,596
Joe is a solid, real name.

53
00:09:13,967 --> 00:09:15,467
- Let's say it together...
- Joe.

54
00:09:15,847 --> 00:09:18,281
"Joseph" is some
social science asshole...

55
00:09:18,647 --> 00:09:20,147
who copped out on going
to Art School.

56
00:09:20,407 --> 00:09:23,126
Joseph, let's face it.
Your future is written.

57
00:09:23,607 --> 00:09:26,360
You're going to scrape through
college with your bullshit degree,

58
00:09:26,567 --> 00:09:28,080
you're going to get a job at K-Mart...

59
00:09:28,367 --> 00:09:30,358
You're going to claw your way
up to manager...

60
00:09:30,567 --> 00:09:33,604
You're going to marry
a sweet but boring wife...

61
00:09:34,047 --> 00:09:36,959
You're going to have two cute
but boring children...

62
00:09:37,207 --> 00:09:38,845
You're going to live
in the burbs...

63
00:09:39,407 --> 00:09:40,907
So what's the point?

64
00:09:41,007 --> 00:09:42,759
- Go talk to her!
- Now!

65
00:09:42,967 --> 00:09:44,764
The one you were dreaming
about last night.

66
00:09:44,967 --> 00:09:47,686
She's right there.
She's your salvation, right?

67
00:09:48,047 --> 00:09:49,166
- Come on, Joe!
- Come on, man!

68
00:09:49,167 --> 00:09:51,044
Come on, baby.
It's up to you.

69
00:10:04,807 --> 00:10:07,446
- Do you have a second?
- No.

70
00:10:08,847 --> 00:10:11,884
Look, this isn't a come on or
anything. I'm doing a survey

71
00:10:12,087 --> 00:10:13,964
for my ethics class
and I was wondering...

72
00:10:14,967 --> 00:10:16,467
Okay.

73
00:10:16,727 --> 00:10:18,282
Okay.

74
00:10:18,347 --> 00:10:19,486
Yes.

75
00:10:19,487 --> 00:10:22,524
All right. Let's say you're stranded
on a desert island, okay?

76
00:10:22,727 --> 00:10:24,797
And you've got to choose
between two guys, okay?

77
00:10:25,167 --> 00:10:28,523
- No, I'm not doing this.
- No, wait. One guy is like him.

78
00:10:30,207 --> 00:10:32,198
He's full of himself, he's loud,
obnoxious, stupid, okay?

79
00:10:32,447 --> 00:10:33,947
- Well, the other...
- I'd pick him.

80
00:10:35,807 --> 00:10:37,638
Would you give me a second?
Just one, please.

81
00:10:37,847 --> 00:10:39,599
While the other guy is caring.

82
00:10:40,367 --> 00:10:43,040
I wouldn't pick the guy like you, if
that's what you're trying to ask me.

83
00:10:43,247 --> 00:10:46,922
A guy like him wouldn't have to use
a bullshit question as a come-on.

84
00:10:47,247 --> 00:10:50,557
He'd have enough balls to come up
and ask me to dance.

85
00:10:52,687 --> 00:10:54,046
I see.

86
00:10:54,047 --> 00:10:55,547
He's crashing and burning.

87
00:10:56,727 --> 00:10:58,227
So, would you like to dance?

88
00:11:00,247 --> 00:11:01,747
No.

89
00:11:05,047 --> 00:11:07,402
Just going to be over here
looking for my ego.

90
00:11:08,207 --> 00:11:09,707
Nice chatting with you.

91
00:11:11,007 --> 00:11:12,507
Oh, no.

92
00:11:13,647 --> 00:11:15,160
What happened, Joe?

93
00:11:16,927 --> 00:11:18,427
All right. Check it out.

94
00:11:18,487 --> 00:11:20,682
Watch and learn.

95
00:11:22,207 --> 00:11:23,707
Go get'em, Tiger.

96
00:11:26,007 --> 00:11:27,406
Well, Joseph.

97
00:11:27,407 --> 00:11:28,965
I'll bet you feel real stupid.

98
00:11:29,207 --> 00:11:31,801
- Yeah, I do actually. Thank you.
- What are friends for?

99
00:11:33,407 --> 00:11:34,907
I'm going over to reload.

100
00:12:16,967 --> 00:12:18,477
Joe Talbot?

101
00:12:27,407 --> 00:12:28,907
What's up?

102
00:12:29,887 --> 00:12:31,605
I just saw this
really beautiful girl.

103
00:12:32,047 --> 00:12:34,038
She knew my name and now
she just disappeared.

104
00:12:36,767 --> 00:12:38,267
What are you drinking?

105
00:12:58,407 --> 00:12:59,907
Hi, it's Mom.

106
00:13:00,087 --> 00:13:01,918
You left some of your
school books here on Sunday.

107
00:13:02,287 --> 00:13:03,686
Come pick them up.

108
00:13:03,687 --> 00:13:05,678
I got another parking ticket
for you in the mail.

109
00:13:05,887 --> 00:13:07,878
But this one is for 38 dollars.

110
00:13:08,127 --> 00:13:11,517
You know, now honey, they'd be
cheaper if you paid them right away.

111
00:13:11,767 --> 00:13:13,564
See you on Sunday for dinner?

112
00:13:13,847 --> 00:13:15,565
I love you. Bye-bye.

113
00:13:16,407 --> 00:13:17,907
Hey, Joe.

114
00:13:18,167 --> 00:13:22,080
Don't forget that party tonight.
Starts at nine.

115
00:13:22,287 --> 00:13:24,403
You're going to be there, right?
We're going to be looking for you.

116
00:13:25,807 --> 00:13:27,307
Joe, I know you're there.
Don't screen.

117
00:13:27,367 --> 00:13:29,642
Pick up the phone. Pick up the phone.
No, don't pick up the phone.

118
00:13:30,287 --> 00:13:31,686
Just get your ass down here.

119
00:13:31,687 --> 00:13:33,996
Girls are getting cold, beer's
getting warm, and you're missing it.

120
00:14:53,207 --> 00:14:54,707
I'm dreaming.

121
00:14:54,967 --> 00:14:56,467
Don't be afraid.

122
00:14:58,287 --> 00:14:59,876
Wait a second.

123
00:15:04,287 --> 00:15:05,787
I saw you at the party.

124
00:15:08,127 --> 00:15:09,627
There must be a God.

125
00:15:25,287 --> 00:15:26,787
My window.

126
00:15:27,807 --> 00:15:29,763
Listen, all right?
this is a little freaky for me.

127
00:15:29,967 --> 00:15:32,083
You're a very beautiful woman, but
you're going to have to leave, okay?

128
00:15:32,287 --> 00:15:33,787
I'm not into this, really.

129
00:15:36,687 --> 00:15:38,187
Oh my God.

130
00:15:41,527 --> 00:15:43,027
What the hell was that?

131
00:15:43,527 --> 00:15:45,027
What the hell was that?

132
00:16:04,287 --> 00:16:06,676
Oh my God, please don't shoot me,
I didn't touch her, I swear!

133
00:16:08,767 --> 00:16:10,837
Come with me or you're dead.

134
00:16:11,247 --> 00:16:12,757
Move!

135
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:17,037
- We have to move fast.
- Why's he after you?

136
00:16:17,327 --> 00:16:18,827
He's not after me,
he's after you!

137
00:16:18,967 --> 00:16:20,467
Me?

138
00:16:29,647 --> 00:16:31,558
Give me the keys.
Give me the keys!

139
00:16:34,927 --> 00:16:36,997
Okay, get in.
Go in.

140
00:17:07,647 --> 00:17:09,147
Okay, number one:
Who were the goons, all right?

141
00:17:09,287 --> 00:17:11,676
Number two: What's up with Mr. Ed
from Hell outside my door?

142
00:17:11,887 --> 00:17:13,046
It's some sort of a spacial rift.

143
00:17:13,047 --> 00:17:15,436
The Castinian Dissonance could have
caused it, but I don't know why.

144
00:17:15,647 --> 00:17:17,147
Yeah, right. Spatial.

145
00:17:17,167 --> 00:17:18,246
Would you make some fucking sense?

146
00:17:18,247 --> 00:17:19,747
You are Joe Talbot, aren't you?

147
00:17:20,047 --> 00:17:21,126
Yes.

148
00:17:21,127 --> 00:17:22,627
Well, your life's in danger.

149
00:17:23,447 --> 00:17:24,947
You just take me
to the police, okay?

150
00:17:25,087 --> 00:17:26,587
We'll make it their problem.

151
00:17:27,287 --> 00:17:29,278
I think this one's
out of their jurisdiction.

152
00:18:04,887 --> 00:18:06,684
Look, why don't you
just give me the keys?

153
00:18:06,887 --> 00:18:08,684
Forget I mentioned the cops.

154
00:18:09,407 --> 00:18:10,686
We'll call it even, huh?

155
00:18:10,687 --> 00:18:12,166
No one's playing around here.

156
00:18:12,167 --> 00:18:13,667
You want to stay alive,

157
00:18:13,927 --> 00:18:15,427
then stick with me.

158
00:18:41,967 --> 00:18:43,467
This shouldn't be here.

159
00:18:53,367 --> 00:18:55,119
This definitely shouldn't be here.

160
00:19:03,647 --> 00:19:05,147
A.T.?

161
00:19:05,607 --> 00:19:07,107
A.T.?

162
00:19:08,247 --> 00:19:11,956
Laura? You can stay for coffee
if you promise not to talk.

163
00:19:12,167 --> 00:19:13,406
I need your help.

164
00:19:13,407 --> 00:19:14,907
Oops, you talked.

165
00:19:15,167 --> 00:19:16,667
Goodbye.

166
00:19:16,887 --> 00:19:18,387
If you'd just listen for a second.

167
00:19:19,047 --> 00:19:21,800
I'm out of the help business.

168
00:19:22,007 --> 00:19:23,507
I was sent by the Council
and the Queen.

169
00:19:23,527 --> 00:19:25,483
All right, that's it.

170
00:19:25,927 --> 00:19:27,963
Get the hell out of here and
take your boyfriend with you.

171
00:19:28,687 --> 00:19:29,766
Did you say...?

172
00:19:29,767 --> 00:19:31,837
I don't know what you're talking
about, man. i just met this girl.

173
00:19:35,967 --> 00:19:38,765
- I'm out of here...
- No, not without introductions.

174
00:19:39,407 --> 00:19:42,319
A.T., I want you to meet
Joe Talbot.

175
00:19:43,367 --> 00:19:44,686
Trust me.

176
00:19:44,687 --> 00:19:46,187
That's not him.

177
00:19:49,127 --> 00:19:50,627
So what's that?

178
00:19:52,727 --> 00:19:54,285
You didn't touch it, did you?

179
00:19:55,847 --> 00:19:56,886
Did you?

180
00:19:56,887 --> 00:19:58,923
- Why?
- Because they can home in on you.

181
00:19:59,167 --> 00:20:00,805
You're supposed
to know this stuff.

182
00:20:01,007 --> 00:20:02,507
But who is "they"?

183
00:20:02,727 --> 00:20:04,957
They followed me back to his home.
That's all that happened.

184
00:20:05,607 --> 00:20:07,723
- What are you up to?
- Yeah, I'd like to know that, too.

185
00:20:07,927 --> 00:20:09,427
Stay out of this.

186
00:20:11,367 --> 00:20:13,881
- Where did you get that?
- My father gave it to me.

187
00:20:20,047 --> 00:20:21,547
You sure don't look
like your dad.

188
00:20:22,327 --> 00:20:23,827
I care.

189
00:20:27,367 --> 00:20:29,722
I don't like it,
but I guess we have a mission.

190
00:20:30,127 --> 00:20:31,627
We better get going.

191
00:20:33,247 --> 00:20:34,836
You're coming, too.

192
00:20:36,167 --> 00:20:37,667
Can't do this without you.

193
00:20:38,047 --> 00:20:39,406
I don't think so.

194
00:20:39,407 --> 00:20:40,486
What? You got better things to do?

195
00:20:40,487 --> 00:20:42,364
Yeah. Like living.

196
00:20:44,287 --> 00:20:46,164
It's safer if you stay with us.

197
00:20:47,207 --> 00:20:49,084
You might live long enough
to learn something.

198
00:21:04,607 --> 00:21:07,121
Just for the record,
I think this is a bad idea.

199
00:21:07,327 --> 00:21:09,397
- What's a bad idea?
- Shut up!

200
00:21:10,287 --> 00:21:13,245
- Are you guys spies or something?
- Yeah, we're spies.

201
00:21:23,127 --> 00:21:24,879
This whole thing stinks.

202
00:21:25,847 --> 00:21:27,347
I think we should
get out of here now.

203
00:21:27,447 --> 00:21:28,947
I have my orders.

204
00:21:29,047 --> 00:21:30,547
You've got shit for brains.

205
00:21:30,727 --> 00:21:33,719
Fine, you stay out here as look-out,
and Joe and I'll take care of it.

206
00:21:34,327 --> 00:21:37,478
Actually, I think I'll wait
out here with A.T.

207
00:21:40,007 --> 00:21:41,486
Give me the crystal.

208
00:21:41,487 --> 00:21:43,045
That's not a good idea.

209
00:21:43,847 --> 00:21:46,998
Well, then you two "ladies"
stay out here. I'm going in.

210
00:21:55,847 --> 00:21:57,347
"Ladies".

211
00:21:57,487 --> 00:21:59,125
She called us "ladies".

212
00:22:10,207 --> 00:22:11,845
- So, you knew my dad?
- Why don't you just shut up...

213
00:22:12,047 --> 00:22:13,560
and watch.

214
00:22:14,687 --> 00:22:16,405
Too many eyes around here.

215
00:22:18,247 --> 00:22:19,747
You see them?

216
00:22:27,847 --> 00:22:29,347
Who?

217
00:22:31,887 --> 00:22:33,387
Oh, no.

218
00:22:35,407 --> 00:22:37,204
What's she doing in there,
anyway?

219
00:22:38,647 --> 00:22:41,036
There's something wrong here.

220
00:22:43,607 --> 00:22:46,838
- Look, I'm going inside.
- Tell her to hurry up.

221
00:23:03,807 --> 00:23:07,243
- A.T. reckons it's time to go.
- Not without the Scepter.

222
00:23:07,447 --> 00:23:09,517
- The what?
- The Scepter of Dyrrachion.

223
00:23:09,727 --> 00:23:11,683
It's the crosier staff
of King Jaren the Fourth.

224
00:23:12,367 --> 00:23:13,606
I know that it's here.

225
00:23:13,607 --> 00:23:16,280
Start looking at that end of the
hall, and work your way back...

226
00:23:18,047 --> 00:23:19,547
My name's Joseph, okay?

227
00:23:20,607 --> 00:23:22,107
Joseph.

228
00:23:24,527 --> 00:23:26,027
Excuse me.

229
00:23:27,807 --> 00:23:29,798
- Excuse me.
- I'm sorry.

230
00:23:30,007 --> 00:23:31,486
- Do you work here?
- Yes, I do.

231
00:23:31,487 --> 00:23:32,987
My friend and I were
trying to find...

232
00:23:33,047 --> 00:23:35,277
- something.
- What exactly? Maybe I can help.

233
00:23:39,127 --> 00:23:42,563
The Scepter of Dyrrachion is a very
recent additon to our collection.

234
00:23:42,767 --> 00:23:46,521
It was excavated this year from
an 11th Century Albanian church.

235
00:23:47,207 --> 00:23:48,707
Now as often happens
with these things,

236
00:23:48,887 --> 00:23:51,276
there are many legends
attached to it.

237
00:23:51,487 --> 00:23:53,523
Some refer to its powers,
that it was some sort

238
00:23:53,727 --> 00:23:56,321
of weapon used by mystics,
or possibly it was some kind

239
00:23:56,527 --> 00:23:58,961
of magical key to another world.

240
00:23:59,567 --> 00:24:01,478
If you look closely here,
you see this small...

241
00:24:01,687 --> 00:24:03,359
hollow spot.
Now that...

242
00:24:03,567 --> 00:24:05,603
once held a crystal,
which apparently was...

243
00:24:05,807 --> 00:24:07,320
the source of the
Scepter's power. Now...

244
00:24:07,527 --> 00:24:09,597
what the legend would have you
believe is that...

245
00:24:09,807 --> 00:24:12,844
at some point the Scepter and
the Crystal were separated.

246
00:24:13,047 --> 00:24:16,084
In other words, the magic of it
was dismantled...

247
00:24:16,287 --> 00:24:17,959
in order to make
the world safe again.

248
00:24:20,767 --> 00:24:23,759
Well, it sounds very silly
I know, but...

249
00:24:24,847 --> 00:24:26,758
What you have to remember
is that back then...

250
00:24:27,767 --> 00:24:29,644
people believed in things
like magic.

251
00:24:30,847 --> 00:24:33,281
Certainly believed in it
enough to make it...

252
00:24:34,167 --> 00:24:35,667
real.

253
00:24:37,007 --> 00:24:38,804
So the Scepter has been found,
but the...

254
00:24:39,007 --> 00:24:40,366
Crystal unfortunately...

255
00:24:40,367 --> 00:24:41,867
remains lost.

256
00:24:45,487 --> 00:24:47,042
Laura?

257
00:24:52,327 --> 00:24:53,827
Laura.

258
00:24:58,767 --> 00:25:00,519
Oh, shit! What now?

259
00:25:00,727 --> 00:25:02,227
So what do you think?

260
00:25:02,887 --> 00:25:04,878
Do you think the Crystal's
already been found?

261
00:25:07,847 --> 00:25:09,286
Perhaps you already have it?

262
00:25:09,287 --> 00:25:12,085
- She doesn't know where it is.
- Oh, I think she does.

263
00:25:12,287 --> 00:25:13,959
I think you'd like to help me,
wouldn't you?

264
00:25:14,167 --> 00:25:15,756
Yes.

265
00:25:16,447 --> 00:25:18,002
Where is it?

266
00:25:19,007 --> 00:25:20,507
Where have you hidden it?

267
00:25:26,887 --> 00:25:28,387
Oh, thanks.

268
00:25:33,687 --> 00:25:35,187
I think we should leave right now.

269
00:25:39,487 --> 00:25:40,987
This way.

270
00:25:52,567 --> 00:25:54,067
Let's try the other way.

271
00:26:26,567 --> 00:26:27,926
Thanks.

272
00:26:27,927 --> 00:26:29,427
Anytime.

273
00:26:44,887 --> 00:26:46,957
- A.T., don't!
- Shut up!

274
00:27:00,807 --> 00:27:02,307
Duck!

275
00:27:06,887 --> 00:27:08,387
This place is history.

276
00:27:10,047 --> 00:27:11,547
We're going to jump in there?

277
00:27:12,087 --> 00:27:13,676
Are you crazy?

278
00:27:14,127 --> 00:27:15,627
Do you want to stay here?

279
00:27:52,967 --> 00:27:56,039
Guys, you want to help me out
with something? Because...

280
00:27:56,247 --> 00:27:58,397
I'm having a really
strange feeling...

281
00:27:58,607 --> 00:28:00,643
that I just landed
in the ocean!

282
00:28:01,087 --> 00:28:03,726
What the hell was that?
What is that?

283
00:28:05,927 --> 00:28:07,519
That's a fair question, Laura.

284
00:28:08,127 --> 00:28:09,627
Why the hell did you lead us
into a trap?

285
00:28:09,807 --> 00:28:11,479
We could have got out of there
without you using the Scepter.

286
00:28:11,687 --> 00:28:13,484
Really? Do you know who
that was in the museum?

287
00:28:13,687 --> 00:28:15,962
If we'd done it your way we'd be
standing around drinking coffee.

288
00:28:18,167 --> 00:28:19,667
Are you guys listening to me?

289
00:28:19,887 --> 00:28:23,562
I've had it, all right? I'm sick
of this! I'm sick of your Scepters!

290
00:28:23,767 --> 00:28:26,156
I'm sick of your horses, I'm sick of
your crystals! All right? I'm sick!

291
00:28:26,487 --> 00:28:27,987
I'm sick of it!

292
00:28:28,767 --> 00:28:30,267
Who signed off on your mission?

293
00:28:30,287 --> 00:28:31,486
The Queen.

294
00:28:31,487 --> 00:28:33,000
She'd never do that.
Not on a mission...

295
00:28:33,207 --> 00:28:34,762
like this.

296
00:28:35,967 --> 00:28:37,685
You guys want to clue me in here?

297
00:28:37,887 --> 00:28:39,387
I'm a little in the dark.

298
00:28:39,527 --> 00:28:41,995
I think I deserve some answers.
Now what the hell is going on?

299
00:28:42,367 --> 00:28:44,597
- We're from another dimension.
- We're the good guys.

300
00:28:45,047 --> 00:28:46,486
They're the bad guys.

301
00:28:46,487 --> 00:28:49,285
We have this.
They want this real bad.

302
00:28:49,487 --> 00:28:52,877
Now if we don't get it to a safe
place fast, we're in big trouble.

303
00:28:53,087 --> 00:28:54,587
That's it.

304
00:28:54,607 --> 00:28:55,686
That's it?

305
00:28:55,687 --> 00:28:58,076
That's not it!
What does that mean, "that's it"?

306
00:29:02,767 --> 00:29:04,267
What is it?

307
00:29:12,727 --> 00:29:15,321
- Oh man!
- I guess we're still on Earth.

308
00:29:19,167 --> 00:29:20,667
Did you say "still on Earth"?

309
00:29:21,967 --> 00:29:23,467
As opposed to what?

310
00:29:28,087 --> 00:29:29,587
I think this belongs to you.

311
00:29:49,847 --> 00:29:51,724
I guess this all
seems strange, huh?

312
00:29:54,607 --> 00:29:56,107
No.

313
00:29:56,447 --> 00:29:58,165
Seems pretty cool, actually.

314
00:29:58,487 --> 00:29:59,987
I'm really happy about it.

315
00:30:01,047 --> 00:30:02,924
- Good. Let's go.
- All right.

316
00:30:10,967 --> 00:30:12,480
Do you guys know how
to steal a car?

317
00:30:13,767 --> 00:30:15,267
How did we get here, anyway?

318
00:30:16,967 --> 00:30:18,685
Come on, guys.
We're not in enough trouble?

319
00:30:19,607 --> 00:30:21,563
- Locked?
- Locked.

320
00:30:24,207 --> 00:30:25,666
Wait! Come on.

321
00:30:25,667 --> 00:30:27,523
Can you wait a second, please?

322
00:30:28,207 --> 00:30:29,720
I think I remember,
sometimes they...

323
00:30:33,807 --> 00:30:35,166
On "Earth"...

324
00:30:35,167 --> 00:30:36,667
We call them "keys".

325
00:30:42,047 --> 00:30:43,547
Sit in the back.

326
00:30:45,007 --> 00:30:47,646
Yeah, thanks. But I've had
enough fun for today, really.

327
00:30:48,247 --> 00:30:49,747
Your dad would know what to do.

328
00:30:51,647 --> 00:30:54,605
You know, your Jedi mind tricks
aren't going to work on me, okay?

329
00:30:54,807 --> 00:30:56,320
My dad's got nothing
to do with this!

330
00:30:57,047 --> 00:30:58,166
Okay. You want to stay?

331
00:30:58,167 --> 00:31:01,045
Stay here. I'm not going
to talk you into this.

332
00:31:05,047 --> 00:31:06,636
Joseph.

333
00:31:08,287 --> 00:31:09,797
We need you to come.

334
00:31:10,327 --> 00:31:11,916
Please.

335
00:31:14,767 --> 00:31:16,267
It'll be over soon.

336
00:31:18,967 --> 00:31:20,446
Come on, Princess.

337
00:31:20,447 --> 00:31:22,002
We're leaving.

338
00:31:27,007 --> 00:31:28,507
Okay.

339
00:31:37,727 --> 00:31:40,195
And no more stupid questions.

340
00:31:47,247 --> 00:31:49,841
I still don't see what the
big deal is about the Scepter.

341
00:31:50,687 --> 00:31:52,643
You want to know what it is?
Okay.

342
00:31:53,007 --> 00:31:54,520
It's a cosmic chainsaw.

343
00:31:54,727 --> 00:31:56,843
It cuts holes in our reality.

344
00:31:57,047 --> 00:31:59,242
Tears the boundaries
between dimensions.

345
00:32:00,007 --> 00:32:02,123
Boundaries are good.
We need them.

346
00:32:02,327 --> 00:32:04,045
They keep things separate
and clear.

347
00:32:05,087 --> 00:32:06,587
Now here's the problem.

348
00:32:06,727 --> 00:32:09,844
As long as the Crystal
is inside the Scepter,

349
00:32:10,607 --> 00:32:12,325
those boundaries can melt.

350
00:32:13,167 --> 00:32:14,667
Now the guy Ferris...

351
00:32:14,887 --> 00:32:16,366
The man in the museum.

352
00:32:16,367 --> 00:32:18,085
he wants all of the above.

353
00:32:18,687 --> 00:32:20,757
Because he only wants one world.

354
00:32:21,167 --> 00:32:22,486
One reality.

355
00:32:22,487 --> 00:32:24,125
Yes. Capite?

356
00:32:26,647 --> 00:32:28,147
Yeah.

357
00:32:28,647 --> 00:32:30,239
- I think.
- Good.

358
00:32:30,887 --> 00:32:32,397
Then buckle up.

359
00:32:33,527 --> 00:32:35,116
Clock's ticking.

360
00:33:08,287 --> 00:33:09,787
So...

361
00:33:10,527 --> 00:33:12,027
Which house is yours?

362
00:34:05,007 --> 00:34:06,507
What is he doing?

363
00:34:14,607 --> 00:34:16,325
Stand on either side of me.

364
00:34:25,447 --> 00:34:27,039
When the wind stops,

365
00:34:27,287 --> 00:34:28,800
you can turn around.

366
00:35:17,087 --> 00:35:18,587
I think I want to puke.

367
00:35:18,647 --> 00:35:20,842
Don't puke around here.
You'll turn inside out.

368
00:35:22,607 --> 00:35:24,107
Come on, Joseph.
We only have to make it...

369
00:35:24,167 --> 00:35:25,667
across the valley.

370
00:35:32,487 --> 00:35:33,987
This is where you live?

371
00:35:35,247 --> 00:35:37,124
No, this is the way
to my dimension.

372
00:35:37,327 --> 00:35:39,318
There's a portal up
in the rocks ahead.

373
00:35:40,407 --> 00:35:42,318
From here you can go anywhere.

374
00:35:43,287 --> 00:35:45,039
Picture a house
with different rooms.

375
00:35:45,727 --> 00:35:47,365
In each room is
a different dimension,

376
00:35:47,567 --> 00:35:49,717
connected by a hallway
here at Crossworlds.

377
00:35:52,047 --> 00:35:53,547
How many dimensions are there?

378
00:35:54,047 --> 00:35:55,878
Don't get hung up
on numbers, Joe.

379
00:35:59,327 --> 00:36:00,566
That's it.

380
00:36:00,567 --> 00:36:02,080
I'm done. Put a fork in me.

381
00:36:05,247 --> 00:36:06,747
Don't lose it now.

382
00:36:09,087 --> 00:36:10,642
Okay?

383
00:36:20,447 --> 00:36:21,947
What do we do now?

384
00:36:22,047 --> 00:36:23,547
Try not to die.

385
00:36:57,367 --> 00:36:58,867
Son of a bitch.

386
00:37:28,127 --> 00:37:29,640
Oh, no. Not you again.

387
00:38:20,847 --> 00:38:22,838
- Who is it?
- Police.

388
00:38:23,887 --> 00:38:25,442
Open up!

389
00:38:33,647 --> 00:38:35,603
- How are you doing?
- Fine.

390
00:38:35,927 --> 00:38:38,282
Are you Joe Talbot?

391
00:38:40,527 --> 00:38:42,027
Maybe.

392
00:38:42,367 --> 00:38:43,867
Maybe, huh?

393
00:38:44,207 --> 00:38:46,402
Well, you're "maybe" under arrest!

394
00:38:50,687 --> 00:38:53,838
They came looking for you last
night. Hit and run is a big deal.

395
00:38:54,047 --> 00:38:56,083
- Last night? Why didn't you tell me?
- I couldn't find you.

396
00:38:56,287 --> 00:38:59,324
- We were at the party.
- Dude, the party was on Wednesday.

397
00:39:00,247 --> 00:39:02,283
- Today's not Thursday?
- Sorry.

398
00:39:02,607 --> 00:39:04,107
What the hell happened
to Thursday?

399
00:39:04,287 --> 00:39:05,766
Have you been eating
mushrooms, perhaps?

400
00:39:05,767 --> 00:39:07,267
Where have you been, man?

401
00:39:07,767 --> 00:39:09,439
- Damn, you look like shit.
- Thanks.

402
00:39:09,647 --> 00:39:11,399
All right, look.
I can explain, all right?

403
00:39:12,127 --> 00:39:14,846
This girl cam over the other night.
She had a knife, okay?

404
00:39:15,047 --> 00:39:17,515
Then I open the door and
this guy's on a horse, all right?

405
00:39:17,727 --> 00:39:19,319
And he's got a gun. I don't know
if he was her boyfriend or whatever.

406
00:39:19,527 --> 00:39:21,995
But he starts shooting up the place.
And look, he shot up my...

407
00:39:24,207 --> 00:39:26,243
See? It couldn't have been me, guys.
You guys got the wrong guy.

408
00:39:26,447 --> 00:39:27,686
No "hit and run" here.
Not a scratch on my car.

409
00:39:27,687 --> 00:39:29,678
- That's a good excuse...
- I'm buying it.

410
00:39:35,967 --> 00:39:39,198
All right, look. I'm going
to level with you guys, all right?

411
00:39:39,607 --> 00:39:41,837
There were two guys, all right?
They both had guns, all right?

412
00:39:42,367 --> 00:39:43,867
The part about the girl it true,
except...

413
00:39:43,967 --> 00:39:47,357
I wasn't driving the car, she was.
And it all has to do with this...

414
00:39:49,527 --> 00:39:51,116
Cristal.

415
00:39:53,327 --> 00:39:54,840
This sounds pretty crazy,
doesn't it?

416
00:39:55,127 --> 00:39:58,085
No, it's just we've already heard
this story 20 times today.

417
00:39:58,287 --> 00:40:00,403
Now get in the car
before I break your legs.

418
00:40:00,607 --> 00:40:01,686
Don't worry about it, Joe.

419
00:40:01,687 --> 00:40:03,187
I'm going to put all
your stuff in boxes.

420
00:40:03,367 --> 00:40:04,880
You're going to be okay, man.
I'm going to call your mom.

421
00:40:05,087 --> 00:40:06,587
No! Don't call my mom!

422
00:40:06,887 --> 00:40:08,387
We'll call his mom.

423
00:40:08,607 --> 00:40:10,107
Do not call my mom!

424
00:40:13,287 --> 00:40:14,876
Thanks, Mom.

425
00:40:20,367 --> 00:40:22,835
That was quite a story
you told the police in there.

426
00:40:23,247 --> 00:40:25,363
Now suppose you tell me
what really happened?

427
00:40:25,567 --> 00:40:28,604
I didn't want to say anything, but I
think somebody put drugs in my beer.

428
00:40:28,887 --> 00:40:32,800
You're drinking. Studying business
has certainly had a stabilizing...

429
00:40:33,007 --> 00:40:35,157
- effect on your life.
- Things happen to art majors, too.

430
00:40:35,367 --> 00:40:36,877
Mom, listen.

431
00:40:37,487 --> 00:40:40,285
Is there anything you didn't tell me
about the Crystal Dad left me?

432
00:40:40,847 --> 00:40:42,086
What do you mean?

433
00:40:42,087 --> 00:40:43,587
Is that what this is about?

434
00:40:44,127 --> 00:40:45,246
Look, Mom. I need to know.

435
00:40:45,247 --> 00:40:46,839
You didn't lose it?

436
00:40:48,327 --> 00:40:49,827
No.

437
00:40:50,207 --> 00:40:51,646
I shouldn't have given it to you.

438
00:40:51,647 --> 00:40:53,147
I told you when you found it...

439
00:40:53,207 --> 00:40:56,324
in my room that you could have
it as long as you didn't lose it.

440
00:40:56,527 --> 00:40:58,438
Now it was very important
to your father.

441
00:40:58,767 --> 00:41:00,758
And no matter how you feel
about him now,

442
00:41:00,967 --> 00:41:03,162
it will be important to you.

443
00:41:04,207 --> 00:41:06,846
I don't have time for this.
I have to go.

444
00:41:08,007 --> 00:41:10,202
Mom, I need to know more about this.
How did he get it?

445
00:41:10,407 --> 00:41:13,001
I don't know.
I've told you everything.

446
00:41:13,887 --> 00:41:15,445
I'm leaving.
I love you.

447
00:41:15,887 --> 00:41:18,276
- Mom.
- Call me later, Joseph.

448
00:42:51,767 --> 00:42:53,598
Joseph Talbot, it's okay.

449
00:42:54,567 --> 00:42:55,806
I'm a friend.

450
00:42:55,807 --> 00:42:58,367
We need your help.
The whole mission's in jeopardy.

451
00:43:03,727 --> 00:43:05,319
Very funny.

452
00:43:06,047 --> 00:43:07,547
Very funny, guys.

453
00:43:08,807 --> 00:43:10,307
Keep your voice down!

454
00:43:10,407 --> 00:43:11,907
We may have been followed.

455
00:43:12,007 --> 00:43:15,079
- I'm sorry.
- We don't have time to joke around.

456
00:43:15,287 --> 00:43:16,787
That's right. I forgot.
Saving the world...

457
00:43:16,807 --> 00:43:18,718
is a full time job for you guys.

458
00:43:19,927 --> 00:43:23,158
If you won't help me, at least
tell me where I can find A.T.

459
00:43:26,407 --> 00:43:27,907
What did you say?

460
00:43:28,207 --> 00:43:29,707
A.T.

461
00:43:29,807 --> 00:43:31,307
I think you know the guy.

462
00:43:31,847 --> 00:43:33,402
Come here!

463
00:43:34,207 --> 00:43:35,959
Who the hell told you
about A.T.?

464
00:43:36,687 --> 00:43:39,679
I don't know what your problem is,
pal, but we're on the same side.

465
00:43:41,047 --> 00:43:42,636
Aren't we?

466
00:43:47,447 --> 00:43:49,358
Get out of here.
I'm not in the mood.

467
00:43:51,407 --> 00:43:52,726
Okay.

468
00:43:52,727 --> 00:43:54,227
Here's the deal.

469
00:43:54,607 --> 00:43:56,165
Ferris has Laura and the Crystal,

470
00:43:56,367 --> 00:43:58,597
and he's going to kill her
if he doesn't get the Scepter.

471
00:44:11,047 --> 00:44:12,639
All that really happened.

472
00:44:13,607 --> 00:44:14,806
Of course it happened.

473
00:44:14,807 --> 00:44:16,445
- What did you think?
- I don't understand.

474
00:44:16,647 --> 00:44:19,036
- What about my car, my apartment?
- He fixed it.

475
00:44:19,567 --> 00:44:21,067
He fixed everything.

476
00:44:22,287 --> 00:44:23,787
Pretty good at cover-ups, eh?

477
00:44:26,487 --> 00:44:27,926
Is she okay?

478
00:44:27,927 --> 00:44:29,918
She's still alive, but
who knows for how long.

479
00:44:30,127 --> 00:44:31,366
Do you know where the Scepter is?

480
00:44:31,367 --> 00:44:33,005
- No.
- Do you know where A.T. is?

481
00:44:33,367 --> 00:44:35,198
- No.
- Do you know where he lives?

482
00:44:35,407 --> 00:44:37,506
- Yes... no.
- Yes... no. What is it?

483
00:44:37,527 --> 00:44:39,677
Look, I don't know, all right?
I went to his place and...

484
00:44:39,887 --> 00:44:41,639
it was gone. It was gone.

485
00:44:41,847 --> 00:44:44,998
You must have done something wrong.
We'll go there together. Come on.

486
00:44:46,447 --> 00:44:47,947
Come on.

487
00:45:01,967 --> 00:45:03,467
No, not this again.

488
00:45:03,927 --> 00:45:05,427
Come on, kid.

489
00:47:02,687 --> 00:47:06,282
- Joe! What took you so long?
- Me? Where the hell have you been?

490
00:47:07,327 --> 00:47:08,766
I've been waiting for you.
You want some coffee?

491
00:47:08,767 --> 00:47:11,520
No, I don't want any damn coffee.
Do you have any idea what's goig on?

492
00:47:11,727 --> 00:47:13,006
No, why don't you tell me?

493
00:47:13,007 --> 00:47:15,316
Ferris has Laura and the Crystal.

494
00:47:15,527 --> 00:47:17,438
- Who told you that?
- Some guy named Rebo.

495
00:47:17,647 --> 00:47:19,046
- Rebo?
- Yeah.

496
00:47:19,047 --> 00:47:21,561
We're on our way over here, these
other guys showed up and shot him.

497
00:47:21,767 --> 00:47:23,126
Right in front of me.

498
00:47:23,127 --> 00:47:26,199
Look at you. You don't care. You're
just hanging out drinking coffee.

499
00:47:26,407 --> 00:47:27,907
We've got to do something.

500
00:47:28,767 --> 00:47:30,267
I'm doing something.

501
00:47:30,647 --> 00:47:33,002
I've got the Scepter,
I've got a plan.

502
00:47:33,967 --> 00:47:35,467
Now what do you suggest we do?

503
00:47:35,567 --> 00:47:37,067
I don't know, okay?

504
00:47:37,647 --> 00:47:39,956
All I know is we've got to save
Laura and get to Ferris somehow.

505
00:47:40,407 --> 00:47:43,001
I think that can be arranged.

506
00:47:44,967 --> 00:47:46,467
Well, well...

507
00:47:46,567 --> 00:47:48,067
Mr. A.T.

508
00:47:48,567 --> 00:47:50,205
So, we meet again.

509
00:47:52,247 --> 00:47:54,602
Nice work, kid.
Couldn't have done it without you.

510
00:47:55,967 --> 00:47:57,206
But you're dead.

511
00:47:57,207 --> 00:47:58,707
I saw them...

512
00:47:58,767 --> 00:48:00,267
Ah, smoke and mirrors.

513
00:48:00,527 --> 00:48:02,027
Son of a bitch!

514
00:48:02,887 --> 00:48:04,525
Joe, I don't think so.

515
00:48:04,967 --> 00:48:06,685
Good advice, old man.

516
00:48:07,167 --> 00:48:09,362
Now unless you want the top
of this kid's head blown off,

517
00:48:09,567 --> 00:48:12,206
I suggest you hand over
the Scepter right now.

518
00:48:12,927 --> 00:48:15,600
Look, why don't you skip
the tough-guy routine...

519
00:48:15,807 --> 00:48:17,763
and take us to Ferris.

520
00:48:19,767 --> 00:48:21,519
This isn't what I had in mind.

521
00:48:38,687 --> 00:48:40,837
- Felling pretty good?
- Yeah.

522
00:48:42,527 --> 00:48:44,027
Yeah, it's a good feeling.

523
00:48:45,007 --> 00:48:47,043
Makes you learn things
about yourself.

524
00:48:47,247 --> 00:48:49,602
Like what? That I'm a complete
and total failure?

525
00:48:51,127 --> 00:48:52,627
Yeah.

526
00:49:17,207 --> 00:49:18,879
- Good morning, Mr. Rebo.
- Morning, Alice.

527
00:49:19,087 --> 00:49:21,587
- Any messages?
- No.

528
00:49:21,687 --> 00:49:24,687
- Coffee?
- Yes, please.

529
00:49:24,727 --> 00:49:26,524
Iced-cappuccino would be nice.

530
00:49:35,767 --> 00:49:37,723
What is it with you guys
and your rooms?

531
00:49:53,407 --> 00:49:54,917
You're lucky.

532
00:49:57,487 --> 00:49:59,076
Hi.

533
00:50:01,527 --> 00:50:04,837
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine. And you?

534
00:50:05,487 --> 00:50:06,987
I've had better days.

535
00:50:08,127 --> 00:50:10,721
- How did you get caught?
- Is this seat taken?

536
00:50:16,287 --> 00:50:17,787
We came here to rescue you.

537
00:50:18,727 --> 00:50:20,227
I knew I could count on you.

538
00:50:21,167 --> 00:50:22,667
Anytime.

539
00:50:32,287 --> 00:50:33,787
I'm sorry.

540
00:50:34,207 --> 00:50:35,326
Look, it's not your fault, okay?

541
00:50:35,327 --> 00:50:37,079
Yeah, it is.

542
00:50:38,887 --> 00:50:40,479
I wasn't asked to get the Crystal.

543
00:50:41,367 --> 00:50:42,959
I was supposed to bring back
the Scepter.

544
00:50:43,167 --> 00:50:44,206
But I thought that the Crystal...

545
00:50:44,207 --> 00:50:45,707
might be in jeopardy.

546
00:50:45,807 --> 00:50:48,719
Come on, it's okay.
All right, it's okay.

547
00:50:49,847 --> 00:50:52,964
I mean, this isn't okay,
but it's...

548
00:50:53,207 --> 00:50:54,707
going to be fine.

549
00:50:57,167 --> 00:50:58,667
Thanks.

550
00:51:08,527 --> 00:51:10,027
A.T.

551
00:51:10,567 --> 00:51:12,285
How good to see you.

552
00:51:13,527 --> 00:51:15,082
Come in.

553
00:51:15,207 --> 00:51:16,707
Make yourself comfortable.

554
00:51:25,167 --> 00:51:26,667
Yes?

555
00:51:29,847 --> 00:51:31,402
Please.

556
00:51:33,407 --> 00:51:35,125
Where do you get your help
these days?

557
00:51:35,327 --> 00:51:38,478
Well, probably from exactly
the same place that I found you.

558
00:51:39,167 --> 00:51:41,283
That must have been my
"asshole" period.

559
00:51:42,167 --> 00:51:43,677
We all have them.

560
00:51:43,847 --> 00:51:46,236
Really? I must have missed mine.
Your...

561
00:51:46,447 --> 00:51:48,119
apprentices seem to show
a lot of promise.

562
00:51:48,327 --> 00:51:49,827
Take a seat.

563
00:51:49,927 --> 00:51:51,485
I'm retired. You know that.

564
00:51:51,687 --> 00:51:54,565
No, I didn't know.
I'm confused.

565
00:51:54,767 --> 00:51:56,267
If you're retired,
what are you doing here?

566
00:51:58,847 --> 00:52:01,486
You're not working for
the Resistance again, are you?

567
00:52:02,007 --> 00:52:03,520
They're too organized.

568
00:52:04,647 --> 00:52:06,126
Too many secrets.

569
00:52:06,127 --> 00:52:08,083
Well, we all have
hidden agendas.

570
00:52:09,247 --> 00:52:11,317
My only "agenda" is the truth.

571
00:52:12,047 --> 00:52:13,126
It's a pity.

572
00:52:13,127 --> 00:52:16,085
You're very good. I mean,
not as good as me, but...

573
00:52:16,927 --> 00:52:18,427
Very good.

574
00:52:19,207 --> 00:52:20,720
I've never felt better.

575
00:52:21,727 --> 00:52:23,086
Really?

576
00:52:23,087 --> 00:52:24,597
Really.

577
00:53:07,807 --> 00:53:09,046
Look.

578
00:53:09,047 --> 00:53:10,366
I'll tell you where
the Scepter...

579
00:53:10,367 --> 00:53:12,278
is if you let the kids go.

580
00:53:12,487 --> 00:53:15,877
Actually, I was hoping we might
be able to work together again.

581
00:53:16,167 --> 00:53:17,667
Like old times?

582
00:53:18,807 --> 00:53:20,206
I'm not that...

583
00:53:20,207 --> 00:53:21,796
sentimental.

584
00:53:23,887 --> 00:53:25,878
You don't still think
of me as evil, do you?

585
00:53:26,887 --> 00:53:29,765
You and your Warlords have already
taken over one dimension.

586
00:53:30,807 --> 00:53:32,445
You eliminated half the people.

587
00:53:32,647 --> 00:53:36,037
You forced the rest into slavery.
I think it qualifies.

588
00:53:37,447 --> 00:53:39,403
A few simple rules, that's all.

589
00:53:40,207 --> 00:53:42,198
We just brought some order
to the chaos.

590
00:53:44,447 --> 00:53:46,961
Nobody asked for
your simple rules.

591
00:53:47,167 --> 00:53:49,442
Why don't you let people
screw up their own lives?

592
00:53:50,087 --> 00:53:51,587
It belongs to them.

593
00:53:52,047 --> 00:53:54,436
I'd rather see the world
go to hell...

594
00:53:54,727 --> 00:53:58,117
than hand it over to a
self-important little punk like you.

595
00:54:20,047 --> 00:54:22,242
Then let's watch the world
go to hell together.

596
00:54:25,567 --> 00:54:27,922
One soul at a time.

597
00:54:51,767 --> 00:54:54,227
A.T.
You okay?

598
00:54:54,247 --> 00:54:56,477
It's not easy doing business
with morons.

599
00:54:59,007 --> 00:55:00,507
You want more, old man?

600
00:55:01,407 --> 00:55:02,907
See what I mean?

601
00:55:03,447 --> 00:55:05,036
That's enough!

602
00:55:06,687 --> 00:55:08,279
I think he broke my nose.

603
00:55:09,087 --> 00:55:11,806
It seems my old friend A.T. is
very concerned about your welfare.

604
00:55:13,047 --> 00:55:15,117
I think he's afraid I'm going to
kill you once I get the Scepter.

605
00:55:15,327 --> 00:55:17,363
So, what I've decided
to do is remove...

606
00:55:17,567 --> 00:55:19,478
this obstacle from
our negotiations...

607
00:55:19,687 --> 00:55:21,187
and kill you now.

608
00:55:23,287 --> 00:55:25,323
If you're going to kill us,
kill us.

609
00:55:25,527 --> 00:55:27,027
Don't bore us to death.

610
00:55:27,567 --> 00:55:29,558
I'm not bluffing.
Give me the Scepter.

611
00:55:30,207 --> 00:55:32,004
Kiss my ass.

612
00:55:32,487 --> 00:55:33,987
I don't think so.

613
00:55:35,167 --> 00:55:36,366
Look, guys...

614
00:55:36,367 --> 00:55:39,086
I think there's definitey another
solution. We can work this out.

615
00:55:39,287 --> 00:55:40,800
I'm sorry, Joseph.

616
00:55:41,407 --> 00:55:44,160
Dying for a lost cause
seems to run in your family.

617
00:55:48,527 --> 00:55:50,027
Ciao, baby.

618
00:56:08,527 --> 00:56:09,846
Where did you put them?

619
00:56:09,847 --> 00:56:11,246
Somewhere safe.

620
00:56:11,247 --> 00:56:13,363
How do I know you didn't
zap them straight to hell?

621
00:56:13,927 --> 00:56:15,440
Because I keep my promises.

622
00:56:16,607 --> 00:56:18,107
I don't.

623
00:56:18,767 --> 00:56:20,267
Okay, do it.

624
00:57:25,727 --> 00:57:27,316
Mom?

625
00:57:27,967 --> 00:57:29,467
I didn't know where else
to take you.

626
00:57:37,167 --> 00:57:38,680
Why didn't you tell me, Mom?

627
00:57:38,887 --> 00:57:41,799
- You weren't ready.
- When was I going to be ready?

628
00:57:42,287 --> 00:57:43,787
When they killed me?

629
00:57:44,127 --> 00:57:46,277
- Your father thought it best not...
- I'm not asking about my father.

630
00:57:46,487 --> 00:57:49,445
to tell you until you were mature
enough to handle it. You weren't.

631
00:57:50,407 --> 00:57:52,557
You never showed me
you were ready.

632
00:58:02,887 --> 00:58:05,117
Sometimes I wondered
if you ever would be.

633
00:58:15,887 --> 00:58:17,400
We have to go back.

634
00:58:21,007 --> 00:58:24,317
I'm fighting a war my people have
fought for thousands of years.

635
00:58:25,287 --> 00:58:26,787
We lost,

636
00:58:26,807 --> 00:58:29,605
and all we have left is
the resistance to fight back...

637
00:58:29,807 --> 00:58:31,365
however we can,
to get our world back.

638
00:58:36,927 --> 00:58:38,645
I need your help, Joseph.

639
00:58:43,727 --> 00:58:45,365
I know you're ready.

640
00:58:56,967 --> 00:58:58,467
Okay.

641
00:59:02,567 --> 00:59:04,122
Okay.

642
00:59:04,567 --> 00:59:07,240
This time we're definitely
taking the elevator down.

643
00:59:09,847 --> 00:59:11,347
I'll check this way.

644
00:59:12,447 --> 00:59:14,165
Hey, where are you going?

645
00:59:18,367 --> 00:59:20,039
- Thanks.
- Anytime.

646
00:59:43,607 --> 00:59:45,245
I'm glad you could stop by.

647
00:59:45,647 --> 00:59:47,147
Where's the Crystal?

648
00:59:47,327 --> 00:59:48,827
All right.

649
00:59:57,527 --> 00:59:59,027
Let's get out of here.

650
01:00:00,807 --> 01:00:02,320
This strike anyone as weird?

651
01:00:02,887 --> 01:00:04,559
No. Let's go.

652
01:00:12,447 --> 01:00:15,484
- You think this is too easy?
- Maybe we just got lucky.

653
01:00:19,127 --> 01:00:20,799
I don't believe in luck.

654
01:00:23,687 --> 01:00:26,281
This is not like Ferris.
He's better than this.

655
01:00:26,887 --> 01:00:29,242
Yeah, well, maybe we're
just better than him, huh?

656
01:00:30,887 --> 01:00:32,605
That's more like him.

657
01:00:34,967 --> 01:00:36,446
Whatever happens now,

658
01:00:36,447 --> 01:00:38,324
it's not real.
It doesn't exist.

659
01:00:44,367 --> 01:00:45,959
- It's not real.
- It's not real, huh?

660
01:00:46,167 --> 01:00:48,362
- Okay?
- It's not real. It's not real.

661
01:00:50,287 --> 01:00:52,005
Holy shit!

662
01:00:53,247 --> 01:00:55,283
- Don't look down!
- That looked real!

663
01:00:55,487 --> 01:00:56,806
The floor is under you.

664
01:00:56,807 --> 01:00:58,206
Believe in the floor.

665
01:00:58,207 --> 01:00:59,686
But that looked very real!

666
01:00:59,687 --> 01:01:01,439
Believe in the floor.

667
01:01:01,927 --> 01:01:03,599
- Believe in the floor?
- Yeah.

668
01:01:04,007 --> 01:01:05,507
I believe in the floor.

669
01:01:06,167 --> 01:01:07,805
I believe in the floor.

670
01:01:14,247 --> 01:01:15,747
Don't look down!

671
01:01:16,767 --> 01:01:18,356
Oh, my God.

672
01:01:22,767 --> 01:01:24,267
- I'll help you.
- No.

673
01:01:24,687 --> 01:01:26,187
Don't move!

674
01:01:26,287 --> 01:01:28,676
Just concentrate on the elevator.
Keep your feet right there.

675
01:01:33,167 --> 01:01:34,759
I'm going to try swinging you
up to A.T., okay?

676
01:01:34,967 --> 01:01:36,467
Don't drop me!

677
01:01:50,807 --> 01:01:52,046
I didn't want to mention...

678
01:01:52,047 --> 01:01:55,562
this before, but if you're not up
here by the time we hit the floor...

679
01:01:55,767 --> 01:01:57,644
you'll be crushed
under the elevator.

680
01:01:59,807 --> 01:02:01,362
Climb up me.

681
01:02:05,487 --> 01:02:06,987
Seven!

682
01:02:08,607 --> 01:02:10,117
Six!

683
01:02:23,087 --> 01:02:24,587
Hurry up!

684
01:02:29,047 --> 01:02:30,547
Give me your hand.
Come on.

685
01:02:38,527 --> 01:02:40,802
That was not so bad.

686
01:02:42,607 --> 01:02:44,107
Feeling better?

687
01:02:44,407 --> 01:02:45,907
Yeah, it's great.

688
01:02:48,407 --> 01:02:50,125
So you're saying my dad
did all this stuff, too?

689
01:02:51,367 --> 01:02:54,165
No, things were different
back then. Easier.

690
01:02:55,887 --> 01:02:57,476
What was he like?

691
01:02:58,407 --> 01:02:59,907
He was a good man.

692
01:03:01,087 --> 01:03:04,636
He died to keep you and your mom
safe. I hope you respect that.

693
01:03:05,287 --> 01:03:06,787
He was a lot like you,

694
01:03:07,567 --> 01:03:09,319
and he didn't turn out so bad.

695
01:03:12,207 --> 01:03:13,799
So, he got you
to switch sides, huh?

696
01:03:14,047 --> 01:03:15,844
Yeah, well, there was a woman...

697
01:03:16,607 --> 01:03:18,643
Okay, guys.
Let's get moving along.

698
01:03:19,087 --> 01:03:20,086
Where is it?

699
01:03:20,087 --> 01:03:21,597
It's right here.

700
01:03:22,247 --> 01:03:23,747
You turned it into a car?
Wow!

701
01:03:25,207 --> 01:03:26,707
It's in the trunk.

702
01:03:32,127 --> 01:03:33,627
I better do that.

703
01:03:49,447 --> 01:03:50,947
Did you hear that?

704
01:03:53,607 --> 01:03:55,199
Yeah, where did it come from?

705
01:03:59,687 --> 01:04:02,645
Man, you can't take a piss these
days without them knowing about it.

706
01:04:02,847 --> 01:04:04,347
Here, take this...

707
01:04:04,807 --> 01:04:05,846
and this.

708
01:04:05,847 --> 01:04:07,519
And get the hell out of here.

709
01:04:07,727 --> 01:04:09,227
- What about you?
- I'll catch up with you.

710
01:04:09,327 --> 01:04:10,885
I don't think that's a good idea.
We should stick together.

711
01:04:11,087 --> 01:04:13,806
- Yeah, I think so, too.
- Yeah, that's nice.

712
01:04:14,127 --> 01:04:15,627
Get out of here.

713
01:04:16,047 --> 01:04:17,547
Let's go.

714
01:04:41,247 --> 01:04:43,158
I knew this was getting too easy.

715
01:04:45,447 --> 01:04:47,802
- How's the...?
- Where's the Scepter?

716
01:04:51,647 --> 01:04:53,147
Locked!

717
01:04:54,727 --> 01:04:56,227
The Scepter...

718
01:04:57,087 --> 01:04:58,587
is in the trunk.

719
01:04:58,767 --> 01:05:00,267
Then open it.

720
01:05:08,207 --> 01:05:09,707
No.

721
01:05:10,047 --> 01:05:11,547
You open it.

722
01:05:32,327 --> 01:05:33,965
You want to explain to me
why this thing isn't working?

723
01:05:36,647 --> 01:05:38,147
Oh, shit!

724
01:05:49,527 --> 01:05:51,483
Laura, no. It's too late.
Come on.

725
01:05:51,687 --> 01:05:53,564
There's nothing you can do.
Let's go. Come on!

726
01:06:05,487 --> 01:06:07,955
What are you doing in the damn road,
you stupid son of a bitch?

727
01:06:08,167 --> 01:06:09,998
Look, we're sorry, okay,
but we need your car.

728
01:06:14,327 --> 01:06:15,827
I'm driving!

729
01:06:54,327 --> 01:06:56,397
Look, he knew what
he was doing, all right?

730
01:06:59,847 --> 01:07:02,884
Let's finish what we started and get
this thing back where it belongs.

731
01:07:36,847 --> 01:07:39,077
- I can't find it.
- I thought you knew where it was.

732
01:07:39,287 --> 01:07:40,787
No.

733
01:07:40,887 --> 01:07:43,765
- Well, how did you get here?
- Someone helped me through.

734
01:07:43,967 --> 01:07:46,686
- Great.
- We're never going to find it.

735
01:08:36,527 --> 01:08:38,961
I feel like a complete idiot.

736
01:08:58,167 --> 01:09:00,044
This is great.
Damn it!

737
01:09:05,247 --> 01:09:06,747
Come here.

738
01:09:06,887 --> 01:09:08,387
I did it.

739
01:09:08,607 --> 01:09:10,107
We wait for the wind, right?

740
01:09:17,767 --> 01:09:19,267
- What's that?
- Oh, shit!

741
01:09:21,607 --> 01:09:23,677
- Come on! Come on!
- Come on, come on!

742
01:09:25,207 --> 01:09:26,707
We're not going to make it!

743
01:09:36,167 --> 01:09:37,286
Which way do we go?

744
01:09:37,287 --> 01:09:39,323
Towards those rocks.

745
01:09:40,287 --> 01:09:42,960
- You're going to be okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine. Just lead the way.

746
01:10:05,447 --> 01:10:06,947
We're almost there.

747
01:10:08,687 --> 01:10:10,187
Not quite.

748
01:10:10,927 --> 01:10:12,997
Are you people always
in such a hurry?

749
01:10:14,247 --> 01:10:15,747
Give me the Scepter, Joseph.

750
01:10:16,287 --> 01:10:17,787
I don't think so.

751
01:10:18,047 --> 01:10:20,720
War is over, my friends. What's
the point of making trouble now?

752
01:10:21,607 --> 01:10:22,966
I don't know.

753
01:10:22,967 --> 01:10:24,467
Just to piss you off, maybe?

754
01:10:26,407 --> 01:10:27,446
Give it to me!

755
01:10:27,447 --> 01:10:28,947
Run, Joe!

756
01:10:33,607 --> 01:10:35,802
Now you've just run out of friends
and run out of time.

757
01:10:42,367 --> 01:10:43,867
How did that happen?

758
01:10:45,487 --> 01:10:47,045
Hey you!
Hold it right there!

759
01:10:47,927 --> 01:10:49,427
Glad you could make it.

760
01:10:49,807 --> 01:10:51,307
My pleasure. Anytime.

761
01:10:53,087 --> 01:10:54,805
Rebo, you're such
an embarrassment.

762
01:10:55,007 --> 01:10:57,316
I tried to kill him and I did!

763
01:10:57,527 --> 01:11:00,325
- I just blew myself up trying.
- I know, I know.

764
01:11:00,887 --> 01:11:03,242
You try so hard, but...

765
01:11:05,367 --> 01:11:06,766
You're fired!

766
01:11:06,767 --> 01:11:08,723
You can't fire me!

767
01:11:17,447 --> 01:11:18,947
Now, where was I?

768
01:11:19,447 --> 01:11:20,947
You were about to die!

769
01:11:21,127 --> 01:11:24,119
Wait! I think you'll find
it'll work a lot better with this.

770
01:11:24,807 --> 01:11:26,365
You didn't actually think I'd let
you escape with the real...

771
01:11:26,567 --> 01:11:28,478
Crystal, did you?
The whole purpose...

772
01:11:28,687 --> 01:11:31,406
of my causing all this disruption
and chaos was to bring the two...

773
01:11:31,607 --> 01:11:34,326
things together.
Get one to find the other.

774
01:11:35,007 --> 01:11:36,804
I think you'll find things
move a lot faster now.

775
01:11:37,007 --> 01:11:39,237
Which is a good thing,
because I'm not a patient man.

776
01:11:39,927 --> 01:11:41,519
You need to work on that.

777
01:11:50,047 --> 01:11:53,596
- Get the Scepter out of here.
- Are you crazy? I'm not leaving you!

778
01:11:54,247 --> 01:11:55,747
I can do this, Joseph.
Go!

779
01:11:56,087 --> 01:11:58,521
If Ferris gets the Scepter,
it's over for your world.

780
01:11:59,327 --> 01:12:00,686
You can do it.

781
01:12:00,687 --> 01:12:02,200
It's up to you.

782
01:13:20,167 --> 01:13:21,667
You want to play, Joseph?

783
01:13:21,767 --> 01:13:23,267
All right, let's play.

784
01:14:33,047 --> 01:14:34,406
Don't you just love it...

785
01:14:34,407 --> 01:14:35,907
when worlds fall apart, Joseph?

786
01:14:43,887 --> 01:14:46,640
You want to talk now,
just the two of us?

787
01:14:50,327 --> 01:14:51,446
What should I do?

788
01:14:51,447 --> 01:14:52,947
I can't do this alone.

789
01:14:53,527 --> 01:14:55,116
Why not?

790
01:14:55,447 --> 01:14:56,947
Why not?

791
01:14:57,207 --> 01:14:58,845
Look, take this.

792
01:14:59,847 --> 01:15:01,803
I can not do it for you.

793
01:15:02,127 --> 01:15:04,163
And this will give you
everything you need.

794
01:15:04,487 --> 01:15:07,160
You're the weapon.
Find the will.

795
01:15:14,207 --> 01:15:15,959
I think you're going to need
more than that, Joseph.

796
01:15:16,927 --> 01:15:18,485
I don't understand why
you can't lose gracefully,

797
01:15:18,687 --> 01:15:21,042
like your friends. I mean,
they're getting very good at it.

798
01:15:33,327 --> 01:15:34,827
give me the Scepter, Joseph.

799
01:15:34,847 --> 01:15:36,347
It's all yours.

800
01:15:40,287 --> 01:15:41,876
You missed.

801
01:15:42,927 --> 01:15:44,427
- You're not real.
- Of course...

802
01:15:44,607 --> 01:15:46,107
I'm real.
It's all real.

803
01:15:46,967 --> 01:15:48,559
I mean, that felt real, didn't it?

804
01:15:48,967 --> 01:15:51,162
You want to know something, Joseph?
I like you. I really do.

805
01:15:51,967 --> 01:15:54,117
I think it's because I see
a lot of myself in you.

806
01:15:54,927 --> 01:15:56,427
Charm, perseverance...

807
01:15:57,847 --> 01:15:59,347
I mean, the only reason that
you're not already...

808
01:15:59,447 --> 01:16:01,199
dead is, as you can see,
we appear to have an opening...

809
01:16:01,407 --> 01:16:03,841
and I was wondering if you'd
like to come and work for me.

810
01:16:05,167 --> 01:16:06,667
No, thanks.

811
01:16:07,047 --> 01:16:09,356
We can make a wonderful team
together, you and I.

812
01:16:10,647 --> 01:16:12,236
I'll tell you what.

813
01:16:12,407 --> 01:16:13,907
Why don't you sleep on it?

814
01:16:22,967 --> 01:16:24,206
Does this room...

815
01:16:24,207 --> 01:16:26,243
seem familiar to you,
Joseph?

816
01:16:27,087 --> 01:16:29,506
Vision from the past,
perhaps?

817
01:16:30,327 --> 01:16:31,827
Maybe the future.

818
01:16:33,007 --> 01:16:34,599
A glimpse of your own death.

819
01:16:40,967 --> 01:16:42,958
You're not quick enough
for this game.

820
01:16:46,087 --> 01:16:47,587
Nice punch.

821
01:16:49,927 --> 01:16:51,485
Your anger tasted very good,
Joseph.

822
01:16:53,607 --> 01:16:55,107
Have you got any more?

823
01:17:01,807 --> 01:17:05,117
I killed someone else in here.
Long time ago.

824
01:17:05,687 --> 01:17:07,187
To get the Scepter.

825
01:17:09,447 --> 01:17:11,278
He thought he was a hero, too.

826
01:17:12,207 --> 01:17:13,707
You want to try me?

827
01:17:21,127 --> 01:17:22,627
Angry?

828
01:17:23,127 --> 01:17:24,879
You finally got angry.

829
01:17:25,407 --> 01:17:26,806
Good.

830
01:17:26,807 --> 01:17:28,399
It's a long time coming.

831
01:17:54,407 --> 01:17:57,001
Yeah, I was really
rather hoping that...

832
01:17:57,527 --> 01:18:00,246
I might be able to win you over
to our side, but...

833
01:18:00,847 --> 01:18:02,246
looks like I'm just going...

834
01:18:02,247 --> 01:18:04,317
to have to settle for
the Scepter and the Crystal...

835
01:18:04,527 --> 01:18:06,483
and all the dimensions.

836
01:18:07,127 --> 01:18:08,627
Pity, though.

837
01:18:09,047 --> 01:18:10,878
You put up a much better fight
than you father.

838
01:18:12,527 --> 01:18:14,802
Only to die just as badly.

839
01:18:24,927 --> 01:18:26,516
Guess again.

840
01:18:33,847 --> 01:18:37,157
Now I bet that really hurts,
doesn't it?

841
01:19:03,607 --> 01:19:05,107
Joseph.

842
01:19:05,847 --> 01:19:07,758
- You're all right?
- Yeah.

843
01:19:10,647 --> 01:19:13,161
And it's Joe.
Just plain Joe.

844
01:19:20,087 --> 01:19:21,597
Well,

845
01:19:22,167 --> 01:19:24,317
boys and girls, don't we have
to get this thing somewhere?

846
01:19:58,367 --> 01:20:00,164
I'm glad I got to meet you, Joe.

847
01:20:01,207 --> 01:20:02,707
That sounds like goodbye.

848
01:20:03,367 --> 01:20:04,646
It probably is.

849
01:20:04,647 --> 01:20:07,081
You can't be in that much trouble.
It's not like we lost.

850
01:20:12,567 --> 01:20:14,067
We've missed you.

851
01:20:14,527 --> 01:20:16,027
We have, have we?

852
01:20:20,847 --> 01:20:23,839
Your mission was unauthorized
and foolish to the point...

853
01:20:24,047 --> 01:20:25,878
of jeopardizing the entire
Resistance.

854
01:20:26,087 --> 01:20:27,587
Look, excuse me...

855
01:20:29,007 --> 01:20:30,507
Queen.

856
01:20:31,487 --> 01:20:34,126
Okay, its' her fault, but look...

857
01:20:36,567 --> 01:20:38,080
try not to be so hard on her,
all right?

858
01:20:38,327 --> 01:20:40,682
I mean, you probably would
have done the same thing.

859
01:20:42,687 --> 01:20:44,996
I don't think so.
However...

860
01:20:46,167 --> 01:20:47,667
You did a good job.

861
01:20:48,367 --> 01:20:49,867
Your father would be proud.

862
01:20:50,527 --> 01:20:52,027
As for the Crystal...

863
01:20:54,567 --> 01:20:56,683
it's best if it's kept
in your world.

864
01:21:00,047 --> 01:21:02,003
We could use someone
like you there.

865
01:21:03,247 --> 01:21:04,747
You fought bravely, Joe.

866
01:21:08,087 --> 01:21:09,286
And Alex...

867
01:21:09,287 --> 01:21:10,876
are you going to be around?

868
01:21:11,327 --> 01:21:13,079
The truth is, I'm here...

869
01:21:14,967 --> 01:21:16,467
to stay.

870
01:21:18,167 --> 01:21:19,677
Good.

871
01:21:30,567 --> 01:21:32,444
I guess I must be missing
something, because...

872
01:21:34,567 --> 01:21:36,156
We won, right?

873
01:21:36,607 --> 01:21:39,883
Forget about winning. We only
won because you chose to fight.

874
01:21:40,847 --> 01:21:43,281
- The fight never stops.
- Yeah, but you quit.

875
01:21:44,527 --> 01:21:46,027
I was wrong.

876
01:21:47,167 --> 01:21:48,667
You did good, Joe.

877
01:22:00,487 --> 01:22:02,000
So, you've got
to stay here, huh?

878
01:22:03,047 --> 01:22:05,481
Yeah. This is my home.

879
01:22:06,167 --> 01:22:07,667
So, what are you going to do?

880
01:22:11,247 --> 01:22:13,761
Trans-dimensional warrior.

881
01:22:20,087 --> 01:22:21,587
We get weekends off?

882
01:22:22,247 --> 01:22:23,757
Yes, we do.

883
01:22:30,927 --> 01:22:32,427
I think we're being watched.

884
01:22:46,887 --> 01:22:48,445
Yup, I think they're onto us.
