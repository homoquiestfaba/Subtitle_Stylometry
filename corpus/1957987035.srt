1
00:00:30,965 --> 00:00:32,499
- I have this
reoccurring dream

2
00:00:32,534 --> 00:00:34,368
where I'm cooking pasta.

3
00:00:34,401 --> 00:00:38,840
When it's ready, when the
time comes to drain the water,

4
00:00:38,873 --> 00:00:42,710
I can't bring myself
to let go of the water.

5
00:00:42,744 --> 00:00:46,748
I don't want to drain the water,
I wanna keep all the water.

6
00:00:46,781 --> 00:00:52,119
It's just hot water, just
hot, murky, pasta water.

7
00:00:54,288 --> 00:00:56,123
And I think it means
I'm afraid of letting go

8
00:00:56,156 --> 00:00:57,859
of something I don't need
anymore.

9
00:00:57,892 --> 00:01:02,630
I don't know why.

10
00:03:12,492 --> 00:03:14,896
- You have
two new voice messages.

11
00:03:14,929 --> 00:03:17,632
- Hey, hon,
hope the flight was okay,

12
00:03:17,665 --> 00:03:20,400
and the pills weren't
too strong in the end.

13
00:03:20,434 --> 00:03:21,803
Let me know how the meeting
goes.

14
00:03:21,836 --> 00:03:25,807
Erm, call me soon so I can
tell you how badass you are.

15
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:28,710
I promise, promise the
weekend's gonna fly by, okay?

16
00:03:28,743 --> 00:03:29,877
Love you, Pat.

17
00:03:32,814 --> 00:03:34,816
- Next new message.

18
00:03:34,849 --> 00:03:36,784
- PS, all the hotels on
your list

19
00:03:36,818 --> 00:03:39,821
were fully booked, but I
managed to get you a room

20
00:03:39,854 --> 00:03:42,757
at a boutique hotel just outside
of town.

21
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:46,961
Hope it's okay. Love you, Pat.

22
00:03:46,994 --> 00:03:49,463
It's Taylor, by the way.

23
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:08,983
- Hi, do you have a booking with
us?

24
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:14,856
- Yes.
- First room on the right.

25
00:04:24,532 --> 00:04:28,803
- Are you kidding me?

26
00:04:41,348 --> 00:04:45,553
This room is ugly.

27
00:06:39,499 --> 00:06:43,170
- Hello, excuse me!

28
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,909
I didn't hear anyone arrive.

29
00:06:47,942 --> 00:06:50,745
I'm sorry about that, I was
loud,

30
00:06:50,778 --> 00:06:53,514
but I didn't see anyone come in.

31
00:06:54,215 --> 00:06:55,082
Hello!

32
00:06:59,153 --> 00:07:00,021
Hello.

33
00:07:04,625 --> 00:07:06,093
Is anyone in there?

34
00:07:07,728 --> 00:07:12,533
I'm sorry about the noise, I
didn't know anyone was here.

35
00:07:13,834 --> 00:07:15,636
I'll leave you to it.

36
00:07:22,877 --> 00:07:24,211
- Can I help you?

37
00:07:25,546 --> 00:07:26,213
- You?

38
00:07:29,684 --> 00:07:30,952
- Hello.
- Hello.

39
00:07:35,122 --> 00:07:38,491
- What are you doing here?
- What are you doing here?

40
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:46,901
Are you all right? Did
you know I was here?

41
00:07:49,036 --> 00:07:50,771
I kind of live here.

42
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:54,108
- You live here!

43
00:07:56,711 --> 00:08:00,815
Of all the places? I'm
just staying in this hotel.

44
00:08:00,848 --> 00:08:02,550
- I can't believe it,

45
00:08:02,583 --> 00:08:06,120
the last I heard you
were living in America.

46
00:08:12,226 --> 00:08:15,096
- Hello!

47
00:08:15,129 --> 00:08:19,000
Idris, Idris!

48
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:21,235
Idris!
- Hey, hi!

49
00:08:23,637 --> 00:08:24,538
- Guess what?
- What?

50
00:08:24,572 --> 00:08:27,575
- I fucking did it!
- I knew you would.

51
00:08:27,608 --> 00:08:29,010
- I'm a writer now!

52
00:08:29,043 --> 00:08:31,012
- Sh!
- Oh, shit, sorry.

53
00:08:31,045 --> 00:08:32,847
- Come and tell me downstairs,
tell me everything.

54
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:33,914
- Okay.
- Yeah.

55
00:08:33,948 --> 00:08:35,282
- Well, I mean, it was good,

56
00:08:35,316 --> 00:08:37,184
she literally got me to
do a bit of like a dance

57
00:08:37,218 --> 00:08:38,619
and a bit of a thing.
- Yeah.

58
00:08:38,652 --> 00:08:42,023
- And literally gave me
the job there and then,

59
00:08:42,056 --> 00:08:43,758
because the thing that I
couldn't be dealing with,

60
00:08:43,791 --> 00:08:45,026
is two weeks of like did I get
it.

61
00:08:45,059 --> 00:08:46,594
- No.
- Did I not get it?

62
00:08:46,627 --> 00:08:48,295
- No, no.
- Hey, hey, you okay?

63
00:08:48,329 --> 00:08:51,766
And like, she told me there
and then like, you know,

64
00:08:51,799 --> 00:08:52,733
you've fucking got the part.

65
00:08:52,767 --> 00:08:54,602
I mean, it's amazing.
- Amazing, totally.

66
00:08:54,635 --> 00:08:56,270
- I literally couldn't have
wished for anything better.

67
00:08:56,303 --> 00:08:57,071
Be excited for me, be happy for
me.

68
00:08:57,104 --> 00:08:59,306
- Totally excited, this is
amazing.

69
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:01,108
- Yeah?
- Yeah, of course I am.

70
00:09:01,142 --> 00:09:02,943
- It could've just gone on for
ages

71
00:09:02,977 --> 00:09:04,779
or they could've been like-
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, ssh!

72
00:09:04,812 --> 00:09:06,981
- What do you mean, shush?
- No, no, I don't mean...

73
00:09:07,014 --> 00:09:08,149
I don't mean.

74
00:09:08,182 --> 00:09:09,683
I don't mean shit.
- What are you thinking?

75
00:09:09,717 --> 00:09:10,785
- Not shush, shush, shush.
- I'm so excited.

76
00:09:10,818 --> 00:09:11,886
- I know.

77
00:09:11,919 --> 00:09:13,754
- Are you not excited for me?
- I'm so excited.

78
00:09:13,788 --> 00:09:17,058
- Oh, my God, you know where she
saw me?

79
00:09:18,092 --> 00:09:19,326
The casting director?

80
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,262
- No.
- She saw me

81
00:09:21,295 --> 00:09:23,130
in that fucking gig in
Manchester.

82
00:09:23,164 --> 00:09:24,632
- Yeah.
- That terrible gig.

83
00:09:24,665 --> 00:09:26,200
- No, you're kidding.
- Yeah, apparently,

84
00:09:26,233 --> 00:09:28,135
and she was just like, I
remember
seeing you that night and-

85
00:09:28,169 --> 00:09:30,104
- Great.
- You were just like, electric

86
00:09:30,137 --> 00:09:31,872
and like, dynamic.

87
00:09:31,906 --> 00:09:34,608
The gig that you told me
was like the first time,

88
00:09:34,642 --> 00:09:38,312
that you were like, oh, no,
I actually like this girl.

89
00:09:38,345 --> 00:09:39,847
That's the gig that she came to
see,

90
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:43,150
so clearly I was like
exuding amazing energy

91
00:09:43,184 --> 00:09:44,385
that night or something.

92
00:09:44,418 --> 00:09:47,021
And then it was cool, because
that they actually had me do

93
00:09:47,054 --> 00:09:48,255
in the end with a guy.
- A guy?

94
00:09:48,289 --> 00:09:51,625
- So they cast, they got the
cast in so as to do it with me.

95
00:09:51,659 --> 00:09:53,294
But he was quite good actually.

96
00:09:53,327 --> 00:09:54,862
- Yeah.
- You don't feel well?

97
00:09:54,895 --> 00:09:57,898
- No, I feel really
good, I think I'm just...

98
00:09:57,932 --> 00:10:01,702
I think I'm just excited about
everything you're telling me.

99
00:10:01,735 --> 00:10:04,004
- Oh, yeah, did anyone come?

100
00:10:05,272 --> 00:10:08,776
- Where?
- What do you mean, where?

101
00:10:08,809 --> 00:10:11,278
Here. What have you been doing?

102
00:10:12,413 --> 00:10:15,649
- So you arrived there and
then you were in a big room,

103
00:10:15,683 --> 00:10:17,318
there's a stage?
- What? No.

104
00:10:17,351 --> 00:10:18,185
- It's just like a regular room?

105
00:10:18,219 --> 00:10:19,987
- It's like a
rehearsal room.

106
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:21,188
- It looks like a regular room.

107
00:10:21,222 --> 00:10:22,289
- Yeah, it was-
- How many people

108
00:10:22,323 --> 00:10:22,857
were in there, like, there's
three people in there?

109
00:10:22,890 --> 00:10:25,659
- Did the guests arrive?

110
00:10:25,693 --> 00:10:28,395
- I was tryna set up the decks.

111
00:10:28,429 --> 00:10:30,131
- Right, so you
were doing your fucking thing,

112
00:10:30,164 --> 00:10:31,065
the one thing I asked you to
do--

113
00:10:31,098 --> 00:10:32,199
- No, the electricity went.

114
00:10:32,233 --> 00:10:33,200
- No.
- Hear me out.

115
00:10:33,234 --> 00:10:33,767
- No, I get it, you were
setting up the decks.

116
00:10:33,801 --> 00:10:34,969
I'll check the books.

117
00:10:35,002 --> 00:10:35,903
- No, no, the music was really
loud. Louis, so this is--

118
00:10:35,936 --> 00:10:38,105
- If anyone's here, it'll be in
this book.

119
00:10:38,139 --> 00:10:39,907
- This is the thing and
this is what you think.

120
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:41,909
- What are you doing? I need
to see if someone's here.

121
00:10:41,942 --> 00:10:43,377
- The thing is that this
is what the thing is.

122
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:45,179
- Oh, my...

123
00:10:45,212 --> 00:10:46,313
Someone is here, I told you
before--

124
00:10:46,347 --> 00:10:51,285
- I've got to tell you
something. People...

125
00:10:51,318 --> 00:10:52,653
History, time.

126
00:10:55,756 --> 00:10:57,158
- What the...
- Old time.

127
00:10:57,191 --> 00:11:00,828
- Oh, I'm sorry, two seconds,
I've been meaning to...

128
00:11:00,861 --> 00:11:02,429
Hi.
- Here's hoping, I am tired.

129
00:11:02,463 --> 00:11:03,998
- Sir, excuse me.

130
00:11:05,733 --> 00:11:06,934
- Louise, wait.

131
00:11:08,135 --> 00:11:12,039
I'm so lucky to have found you.
No, are...

132
00:11:12,072 --> 00:11:14,341
You're just amazing.

133
00:11:25,452 --> 00:11:27,388
My ex-wife is upstairs.

134
00:11:29,323 --> 00:11:30,191
- What?

135
00:11:31,158 --> 00:11:32,026
- Yeah.

136
00:11:36,430 --> 00:11:38,032
There, that's her.

137
00:11:41,268 --> 00:11:42,136
- Wow!

138
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:44,738
- Yeah.

139
00:11:44,772 --> 00:11:47,474
I thought you'd invited her

140
00:11:47,509 --> 00:11:49,310
but then I wondered why
you would even do that,

141
00:11:49,343 --> 00:11:50,311
but then I realised that would
be crazy.

142
00:11:50,344 --> 00:11:51,312
- That would be insane.
- You wouldn't do that.

143
00:11:51,345 --> 00:11:53,781
- I would never, why?
- So she's just here.

144
00:11:53,814 --> 00:11:55,950
- Because?
- She's a guest,

145
00:11:57,017 --> 00:11:58,085
she happens to be a guest.

146
00:11:58,118 --> 00:12:02,389
- She happens to be a guest.
- It's a coincidence.

147
00:12:02,423 --> 00:12:07,261
I haven't seen her for 10
years, I haven't spoken either.

148
00:12:07,294 --> 00:12:08,162
I haven't spoken to her.

149
00:12:08,195 --> 00:12:10,532
- Does she know you have a
girlfriend?

150
00:12:10,565 --> 00:12:12,766
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. No, I
said--

151
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,768
- So it's not gonna be weird,
she's not gonna be like,

152
00:12:14,802 --> 00:12:15,704
oh, who are you there?

153
00:12:15,736 --> 00:12:16,837
- She's not here to see me.
- Well, no.

154
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:19,440
- She's not come looking for me.

155
00:12:19,473 --> 00:12:21,041
- Right.
- She's...

156
00:12:22,109 --> 00:12:24,245
- She's just here.
- She's just here.

157
00:12:24,278 --> 00:12:28,082
- Was it awkward when,
when you spoke to her?

158
00:12:29,116 --> 00:12:30,317
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

159
00:12:30,351 --> 00:12:33,254
- Yeah, I can't really explain
what it was like. It was...

160
00:12:33,287 --> 00:12:36,857
She's, she's an ex but I love
you.

161
00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:38,292
- Right, did you tell-
- I'm so happy

162
00:12:38,325 --> 00:12:42,196
you got that role, though,
it's amazing, yeah.

163
00:12:52,306 --> 00:12:55,209
- You have two saved
messages.

164
00:12:55,242 --> 00:12:57,911
- Hey, hon,
hope the flight was okay

165
00:12:57,945 --> 00:13:00,347
and the pills weren't
too strong in the end.

166
00:13:00,381 --> 00:13:02,016
Let me know how the meeting
goes.

167
00:13:39,186 --> 00:13:42,056
- I, erm, feel a bit
underdressed.

168
00:13:43,957 --> 00:13:47,227
- You look great.

169
00:13:47,261 --> 00:13:50,464
- You look great and I like the-

170
00:13:50,497 --> 00:13:53,967
- Well, I thought, you know-
- You thought?

171
00:13:54,001 --> 00:13:55,969
- It's my 40th coming up.

172
00:13:56,003 --> 00:13:59,139
- All right, yeah.
- I just...

173
00:13:59,173 --> 00:14:00,941
Well, I thought I'd make a
bit of an effort for dinner.

174
00:14:00,974 --> 00:14:02,544
- For dinner?
- For dinner.

175
00:14:02,577 --> 00:14:04,311
- For dinner.
- Yeah.

176
00:14:06,013 --> 00:14:08,082
Hello.

177
00:14:08,115 --> 00:14:10,552
- Patricia, this is Louise.
- Hi.

178
00:14:10,585 --> 00:14:13,588
- I've got on
oatmealy hands, but hi.

179
00:14:13,621 --> 00:14:17,391
- It's okay, I'm, I'm sorry,
I don't mean to interrupt.

180
00:14:17,424 --> 00:14:21,295
I just thought, erm, since
my phone isn't working,

181
00:14:21,328 --> 00:14:24,998
if you could, if I could borrow
a phone

182
00:14:25,032 --> 00:14:28,435
just to call a taxi to get some
dinner or-

183
00:14:29,671 --> 00:14:30,772
- Yeah, definitely.

184
00:14:30,805 --> 00:14:33,907
- There doesn't seem to be
any self-service here, so-

185
00:14:33,941 --> 00:14:38,946
- I mean, absolutely,
but I'm cooking dinner.

186
00:14:39,213 --> 00:14:41,181
- No, no, I don't wanna
trouble you at all.

187
00:14:41,215 --> 00:14:45,854
- I'd like it if
you'd stay, if you wanted to.

188
00:14:46,954 --> 00:14:49,223
- Yeah, why not?

189
00:14:49,256 --> 00:14:53,026
- I'm aware of how acutely
uncomfortable the situation is.

190
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:54,395
- Oh!
- Not at all.

191
00:14:54,428 --> 00:14:55,396
- No, not at all.
- No.

192
00:14:55,429 --> 00:14:57,264
- Listen, I'm
glad you said something

193
00:14:57,297 --> 00:14:58,465
but it's fine.

194
00:14:58,499 --> 00:15:01,001
- It's just, it's just
an incredible coincidence.

195
00:15:01,034 --> 00:15:02,369
- Yes, it's fine.

196
00:15:05,038 --> 00:15:08,510
Louise, it's fine,
please, you can come in.

197
00:15:11,078 --> 00:15:12,279
I mean, only if you want to,

198
00:15:12,312 --> 00:15:14,014
if you wanna go out you can go
out,

199
00:15:14,047 --> 00:15:16,651
but, I mean, I'm making
enough bolognese for-

200
00:15:16,684 --> 00:15:19,319
- It smells delicious.
- So please.

201
00:15:22,289 --> 00:15:25,660
We were supposed to have a
nice couple of days

202
00:15:25,693 --> 00:15:27,494
and damn life happens

203
00:15:31,165 --> 00:15:34,702
and Idris' ex-wife,
Patricia, comes to stay.

204
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:43,076
They haven't seen each
other in a long time,

205
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:47,715
in like 10 years, so they need
time to catch up, I guess.

206
00:15:53,555 --> 00:15:57,424
But in the time being,
erm, it'll be all good.

207
00:16:01,563 --> 00:16:04,666
We'll have a lovely birthday

208
00:16:04,699 --> 00:16:08,168
and, erm, like my mum always
said to me,

209
00:16:10,738 --> 00:16:14,208
resentment is the poison you
drink

210
00:16:14,241 --> 00:16:18,312
while you're waiting for
the other person to die.

211
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:22,249
- So Louise, she's really
lovely.

212
00:16:22,282 --> 00:16:23,585
- Yeah.
- Seems like

213
00:16:23,618 --> 00:16:26,788
she's been a good influence,
you're not drinking.

214
00:16:26,821 --> 00:16:28,723
- I feel great,
I feel really good.

215
00:16:28,756 --> 00:16:30,090
- I can see that, you look good.

216
00:16:30,123 --> 00:16:31,492
- I need to stop, we're having
fun,

217
00:16:31,526 --> 00:16:33,561
we're having a great time.

218
00:16:33,595 --> 00:16:35,395
- Now I'm gonna feel really bad

219
00:16:35,429 --> 00:16:37,264
when I get you to start
drinking.

220
00:16:37,297 --> 00:16:41,034
- No, I couldn't imagine.

221
00:16:41,068 --> 00:16:42,737
So what d'you, what
d'you do, what d'you do?

222
00:16:42,770 --> 00:16:46,139
- I travel and I make
television.

223
00:16:46,173 --> 00:16:49,309
- You make television?
- It's amazing, I love it.

224
00:16:49,343 --> 00:16:51,178
- I'm still playing, by the way,

225
00:16:51,211 --> 00:16:53,313
you didn't ask how I'm doing,
but I'll tell you anyway.

226
00:16:53,347 --> 00:16:54,749
- You're playing?
- Yeah.

227
00:16:54,782 --> 00:16:55,817
- That's good.
- Still doing music.

228
00:16:55,850 --> 00:16:58,051
- Are you still
writing songs about me?

229
00:16:58,085 --> 00:17:00,655
Might be.

230
00:17:01,689 --> 00:17:04,258
- So you're
doing the same thing?

231
00:17:04,291 --> 00:17:06,226
I'm a bit disappointed.

232
00:17:12,399 --> 00:17:14,067
- Hi, how are you
getting on with the menu?

233
00:17:14,101 --> 00:17:15,335
- Good, actually.
- Could I have a look

234
00:17:15,369 --> 00:17:16,771
at what you've got?

235
00:17:16,804 --> 00:17:19,406
- Yeah, I mean, to be honest...

236
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:22,075
I wanted to show you my notes.
- Yeah.

237
00:17:22,109 --> 00:17:25,713
- Erm, and there's no fish on
the menu,

238
00:17:25,747 --> 00:17:27,649
so I was thinking we could put
some--

239
00:17:27,682 --> 00:17:30,484
- Classic scampi and chip
on the dinner there go,

240
00:17:30,518 --> 00:17:31,485
gets a lot of compliments.

241
00:17:31,519 --> 00:17:33,220
- I just feel like we
should incorporate fish

242
00:17:33,253 --> 00:17:35,289
into the menu in...

243
00:17:35,322 --> 00:17:36,658
Well, if we switch out the
Caesar salad

244
00:17:36,691 --> 00:17:40,427
for like a tuna swirl or
something.

245
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:42,195
- What about sort of kipper?
- A kipper kip?

246
00:17:42,229 --> 00:17:45,700
- Okay, I can do kipper.
- Boil a kipper.

247
00:17:45,733 --> 00:17:47,467
- Er, boil a kipper.

248
00:17:49,871 --> 00:17:53,473
Mm, what do I like just fresh
fish but it's lemon salt-

249
00:17:53,508 --> 00:17:55,442
- Like a battered cod. That I
can do.

250
00:17:55,475 --> 00:17:57,612
- See, that's sort of exactly
the opposite

251
00:17:57,645 --> 00:17:58,445
of what I was saying.

252
00:17:58,478 --> 00:18:01,381
I said fit, I want something
healthy,

253
00:18:01,415 --> 00:18:04,151
something nourishing my soul.

254
00:18:04,184 --> 00:18:06,721
My soul needs a little bit of
love

255
00:18:06,754 --> 00:18:08,756
bit of nourishment and healthy
energy.

256
00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:10,592
So I'm gonna say it's healthy
fish,

257
00:18:10,625 --> 00:18:15,228
bit of salt, bit of lemon,
bit of olive oil, done, fish.

258
00:18:15,262 --> 00:18:16,463
- I'm not sure.

259
00:18:18,165 --> 00:18:20,334
- Not sure.

260
00:18:20,367 --> 00:18:23,303
Okay, I'm gonna make it really
easy then.

261
00:18:23,337 --> 00:18:26,173
I'm sure and I want sea bass.

262
00:18:26,206 --> 00:18:29,644
So what we're gonna
have is sea bass, okay?

263
00:19:13,453 --> 00:19:14,956
- What is she doing?

264
00:19:14,989 --> 00:19:18,893
- It's a nice way to wake up
actually, bang, bang, bang!

265
00:19:18,926 --> 00:19:19,794
- Stop it.

266
00:19:26,534 --> 00:19:27,835
Morning.

267
00:19:27,869 --> 00:19:30,237
- Morning, you're pissy, Idris.

268
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:31,471
- Shut up.
- Hi.

269
00:19:32,472 --> 00:19:34,809
- You're up already?
- Yeah.

270
00:19:34,842 --> 00:19:36,778
- What are you doing?

271
00:19:36,811 --> 00:19:40,313
- What's it look like
I'm doing? I'm thinking.

272
00:19:40,347 --> 00:19:42,517
- Can you think without the
ball?

273
00:19:42,550 --> 00:19:44,852
- That's how I think.

274
00:19:44,886 --> 00:19:45,953
- Do you want to use another
wall?

275
00:19:45,987 --> 00:19:48,388
You might break a window.

276
00:19:48,422 --> 00:19:49,590
- No, no, no, I hit
the window,

277
00:19:49,624 --> 00:19:52,225
they're not breakable.

278
00:19:52,259 --> 00:19:53,761
- It's glass.
- I'm coming down.

279
00:19:53,795 --> 00:19:56,463
- No, no, don't bother.
- Hi.

280
00:19:56,496 --> 00:19:58,231
She blew me a kiss,

281
00:19:58,265 --> 00:20:00,535
she just blew me a fucking kiss.

282
00:20:00,568 --> 00:20:03,504
If she offers again to
get a taxi and leave,

283
00:20:03,538 --> 00:20:04,371
you know the answer this time,
yeah?

284
00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:29,797
- Oh, I'll take a nap.

285
00:20:42,610 --> 00:20:45,646
- Feeling a bit better
to say?

286
00:23:08,856 --> 00:23:13,160
You're disgusting.

287
00:23:13,194 --> 00:23:14,929
- You're impossible.

- Still playing the classics.

299
00:26:20,414 --> 00:26:25,119
- The remix of the remix
I have a remix, yeah.

300
00:26:25,152 --> 00:26:28,122
That's what they want to hear so
yeah,

301
00:26:28,155 --> 00:26:31,158
but I'm a bit outta practise
really.

302
00:26:39,667 --> 00:26:40,801
- What's this?

303
00:26:40,835 --> 00:26:43,204
- Oh, fuck, no don't look in
there.

304
00:26:43,237 --> 00:26:45,773
- What's this?

305
00:26:45,806 --> 00:26:47,975
- Don't look in there?
- Well, I wasn't going to

306
00:26:48,008 --> 00:26:50,311
but I pay attention too.
- Come on.

307
00:26:50,344 --> 00:26:54,682
- Old stuff that
I brought over for the...

308
00:26:56,117 --> 00:26:59,854
Oh, God.
- Look at you.

309
00:26:59,887 --> 00:27:00,855
- Yeah, it's stupid.

310
00:27:00,888 --> 00:27:02,690
I was putting them up,
but then I kind of--

311
00:27:02,723 --> 00:27:04,425
- What are you doing?
- I brought it with me,

312
00:27:04,458 --> 00:27:05,993
Louise wanted to bring 'em,

313
00:27:06,026 --> 00:27:07,895
she thought it'd be funny
to have decorations-

314
00:27:07,928 --> 00:27:11,899
- Let's keep it.
- But actually looking at it,

315
00:27:11,932 --> 00:27:14,768
sort of a little bit
embarrassing.

316
00:27:16,237 --> 00:27:19,974
- It's not.

317
00:27:21,375 --> 00:27:24,178
- Okay.
- Idris Thomas, lover boy.

318
00:27:27,148 --> 00:27:31,952
- I think I'm just wanting
to reminisce, I guess.

319
00:27:31,986 --> 00:27:33,888
- Uhuh!

320
00:27:33,921 --> 00:27:36,357
- I dunno what brought that on.

321
00:27:38,993 --> 00:27:42,396
What does it feel like being
back in Komo?

322
00:27:43,264 --> 00:27:45,332
- Erm, it feels like...

323
00:27:45,366 --> 00:27:50,371
Have you ever gone into a house
where there's been a murder?

324
00:27:52,273 --> 00:27:54,308
Not knowingly.

325
00:27:54,341 --> 00:27:59,079
- Okay, feels like coming
home, and it feels like...

326
00:27:59,113 --> 00:28:04,018
Well, right now I feel like
I'm at my funeral.

327
00:28:04,051 --> 00:28:06,420
- Did you see the house?

328
00:28:06,453 --> 00:28:10,457
- Yeah, I stopped by.

329
00:28:13,294 --> 00:28:14,161
- Me too.

330
00:28:17,364 --> 00:28:20,201
- Did you think
it was gonna be there?

331
00:28:20,234 --> 00:28:22,136
- I dunno, I dunno what I was
thinking.

332
00:28:22,169 --> 00:28:24,038
- It was weird.
- Yeah, it's weird.

333
00:28:24,071 --> 00:28:25,507
- It's like it was frozen in
time.

334
00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:26,407
- Yeah.

335
00:28:29,544 --> 00:28:33,747
- Wonder what
lives are being ruined.

336
00:28:36,050 --> 00:28:38,185
- Inside, you mean?
- Yeah.

337
00:28:39,887 --> 00:28:42,790
- I haven't checked for
the key under the mat

338
00:28:42,823 --> 00:28:44,792
the last time I went.
- I did too.

339
00:28:44,825 --> 00:28:46,894
- Did you?
- Yeah, no key.

340
00:28:50,397 --> 00:28:52,299
If there was, I probably
would've gone inside.

341
00:28:52,333 --> 00:28:53,501
- I know you would've done.
- Such a weirdo.

342
00:28:53,535 --> 00:28:56,937
- Yeah.

343
00:28:56,971 --> 00:28:59,807
- I wanted to see what colours
they painted the walls.

344
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:02,176
I mean, it's not a good look.

345
00:29:04,411 --> 00:29:07,915
- What's not a good look?
- I mean, me showing up here.

346
00:29:07,948 --> 00:29:10,217
- Well, it's not a bad look,

347
00:29:12,386 --> 00:29:13,821
it's just was surprising, is all
of this.

348
00:29:13,854 --> 00:29:16,123
- Well, you
were the last person

349
00:29:16,156 --> 00:29:18,225
I thought I would see, my God.

350
00:29:18,259 --> 00:29:19,927
- We're here now,
aren't we? For some reason.

351
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:22,396
- Yeah, for some God awful
reason.

352
00:29:22,429 --> 00:29:23,998
- For some
fucking God awful reason.

353
00:29:24,031 --> 00:29:28,269
- No, I mean, honestly,
I spent many, many years

354
00:29:28,302 --> 00:29:31,805
thinking I would see you,
and then I never did.

355
00:29:31,839 --> 00:29:36,210
It's really something because
the first couple years

356
00:29:36,243 --> 00:29:38,112
that I didn't see you,

357
00:29:39,547 --> 00:29:42,416
it was as if you were just gonna
show up

358
00:29:42,449 --> 00:29:45,919
when I turned a corner
in London and New York.

359
00:29:45,953 --> 00:29:46,820
- Yeah, I have exactly the same
thing.

360
00:29:46,854 --> 00:29:48,289
- In Africa.

361
00:29:48,322 --> 00:29:51,292
It could have been anywhere,
could have been on a safari.

362
00:29:51,325 --> 00:29:54,529
I didn't come in to talk
about the weather, Adam.

363
00:29:54,562 --> 00:29:56,964
I came here to talk about us.

364
00:29:56,997 --> 00:29:59,967
I didn't come in to talk
about the weather, Adam.

365
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,036
I didn't come in to talk
about the weather, Adam.

366
00:30:02,069 --> 00:30:02,970
I came in to talk about...

367
00:30:03,003 --> 00:30:04,038
What do you think it is?

368
00:30:04,071 --> 00:30:06,106
I didn't come here to talk
about the weather, Adam.

369
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:07,441
I didn't come here to talk
about the weather Adam,

370
00:30:07,474 --> 00:30:09,009
I came here to talk about us

371
00:30:09,043 --> 00:30:11,111
or I didn't come here to
talk about the weather, Adam.

372
00:30:11,145 --> 00:30:13,981
No, that's weird.
- Were those different?

373
00:30:14,014 --> 00:30:15,449
- Okay, so I didn't come here

374
00:30:15,482 --> 00:30:16,383
to talk about the weather, Adam,

375
00:30:16,417 --> 00:30:18,285
I came here to talk about us,
that's it.

376
00:30:18,319 --> 00:30:20,287
'Cause it's not weather, it's
us.

377
00:30:20,321 --> 00:30:21,388
So I didn't come to talk
about...

378
00:30:21,422 --> 00:30:23,324
I didn't come here to talk
about the weather, Adam,

379
00:30:23,357 --> 00:30:24,391
I came in to talk about us.

380
00:30:24,425 --> 00:30:27,861
You do it, you do it. Do
Adam, and then do weather.

381
00:30:27,895 --> 00:30:31,899
So he says, it's such
a beautiful day today.

382
00:30:31,932 --> 00:30:35,603
It reminds me of that
day in May back in 2016.

383
00:30:36,904 --> 00:30:40,174
- I say that.
- No, you say my bit, yeah.

384
00:30:40,207 --> 00:30:42,176
- Sorry, I dunno if this
is my sort of forte,

385
00:30:42,209 --> 00:30:44,311
I'm more book person.
- I'll say it,

386
00:30:44,345 --> 00:30:48,048
you say my line 'cause I just
don't need to hear my line.

387
00:30:48,082 --> 00:30:51,085
Oh, it's such a beautiful day
today.

388
00:30:51,118 --> 00:30:52,152
So my line is,

389
00:30:52,186 --> 00:30:53,220
I didn't come here to talk
about the weather, Adam,

390
00:30:53,253 --> 00:30:54,622
I came to talk about us.

391
00:30:54,656 --> 00:30:57,358
- I didn't come
here

392
00:30:57,391 --> 00:31:01,596
to talk about the weather,
Adam, I came to talk about us.

393
00:31:01,629 --> 00:31:03,897
Is that good?
- I have no idea

394
00:31:03,931 --> 00:31:06,033
what I'm doing or why they gave
me this,

395
00:31:06,066 --> 00:31:08,202
it's so hard.
- Yeah.

396
00:31:08,235 --> 00:31:10,904
- Acting is like, this is hard.

397
00:31:11,706 --> 00:31:13,407
- Yeah, maybe
the less you rehearse it,

398
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:16,176
the better it will be,
you know, just sort of-

399
00:31:16,210 --> 00:31:17,444
- Yeah, maybe.

400
00:31:17,478 --> 00:31:20,447
- What have you been doing?
- I mean,

401
00:31:20,481 --> 00:31:23,518
working, working, working my
butt off.

402
00:31:23,551 --> 00:31:25,352
- In New York?
- Yeah,

403
00:31:27,655 --> 00:31:29,990
New York, I live in New York.

404
00:31:30,023 --> 00:31:30,658
- I know you live in New
York.

405
00:31:30,692 --> 00:31:31,959
- How do you not know this?

406
00:31:31,992 --> 00:31:35,295
Don't you have like Instagram? I
dunno.

407
00:31:35,329 --> 00:31:38,098
I don't know via me.

408
00:31:38,132 --> 00:31:42,269
You don't like, I dunno, intrude
at all, you don't like...

409
00:31:42,302 --> 00:31:44,171
You're not curious and ask
anybody when I'm doing?

410
00:31:44,204 --> 00:31:45,939
- Yeah, I've always been...

411
00:31:45,973 --> 00:31:47,675
Well, no, I've always been
curious.

412
00:31:47,709 --> 00:31:50,010
What do you do when you
travel? Sort of work, is it?

413
00:31:50,043 --> 00:31:53,247
- I travel for work, I discover
talent.

414
00:31:55,517 --> 00:31:58,452
Yes, turns out I'm very
good at discovering talent,

415
00:31:58,485 --> 00:32:00,622
writers, writers, writers.

416
00:32:01,523 --> 00:32:02,724
- I'm a writer.

417
00:32:02,757 --> 00:32:06,661
- Yeah, well, no,
I mean novelists, and then I-

418
00:32:06,694 --> 00:32:07,796
- Is that what you're doing
here?

419
00:32:07,829 --> 00:32:12,032
- Well, I turn
their art into television.

420
00:32:14,067 --> 00:32:16,437
- How cool, TV!
- Yeah.

421
00:32:16,470 --> 00:32:18,038
- Yeah.
- So that's what you do,

422
00:32:18,071 --> 00:32:22,075
you travel around and you like
developing?

423
00:32:22,109 --> 00:32:22,911
That's amazing, but that's
great.

424
00:32:22,943 --> 00:32:25,212
- Yeah, and I meet writers.
- Yeah.

425
00:32:25,245 --> 00:32:26,648
- And I get to crush their
dreams.

426
00:32:26,681 --> 00:32:28,081
And that's really what I do.

427
00:32:28,115 --> 00:32:30,050
- Is that some sort of
revenge

428
00:32:30,083 --> 00:32:33,086
or something, you think?
- It's my greatest revenge.

429
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:36,524
- Revenge, yeah, and
what about your writing,

430
00:32:36,558 --> 00:32:38,992
don't you write anymore?
- Oh, not really,

431
00:32:39,026 --> 00:32:40,160
I'm not really...

432
00:32:40,194 --> 00:32:42,630
I'm not any good at that,
I'd rather discover talent.

433
00:32:42,664 --> 00:32:44,298
- You're not gonna believe this.

434
00:32:44,331 --> 00:32:45,466
- What?
- This.

435
00:32:51,338 --> 00:32:54,074
When I was looking through this.

436
00:32:58,111 --> 00:33:00,380
You remember that?
- That's gibberish.

437
00:33:00,414 --> 00:33:03,050
- It's got some beautiful-
- Shit.

438
00:33:03,083 --> 00:33:05,219
I'm not a career novelist, d'you
know?

439
00:33:05,252 --> 00:33:06,521
That was just a little...

440
00:33:06,554 --> 00:33:09,591
That was a game, that was a--

441
00:33:09,624 --> 00:33:12,059
- A game? It wasn't a
game, it was more than...

442
00:33:12,092 --> 00:33:14,294
It wasn't just a game. It wasn't
a game.

443
00:33:14,328 --> 00:33:15,362
Well, it wasn't a game to me.

444
00:33:15,395 --> 00:33:16,598
- No, it wasn't a game, you
know,

445
00:33:16,631 --> 00:33:20,033
It was kind of like, it was
like, rehearsal for real life,

446
00:33:20,067 --> 00:33:22,269
and now, and now, we're living
real life

447
00:33:22,302 --> 00:33:23,738
and you know, real...

448
00:33:23,771 --> 00:33:27,107
And it's reality. Get rid of
that box.

449
00:33:29,677 --> 00:33:32,212
- But you had talent and
you had passion for it.

450
00:33:32,246 --> 00:33:35,082
- You're holding on to the
past, why d'you have that?

451
00:33:35,115 --> 00:33:37,819
I have an idea, we should
have a bonfire tonight

452
00:33:37,852 --> 00:33:42,122
and burn that box, and
burn that, that's garbage,

453
00:33:43,290 --> 00:33:45,125
burn it, just burn it.

454
00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:48,128
- Oh my God, this is a
nightmare.

455
00:33:48,161 --> 00:33:49,764
Is it just me or do the
words actually not sound

456
00:33:49,797 --> 00:33:50,765
like words anymore?

457
00:33:50,798 --> 00:33:54,201
Weather, weather,
weather, weather, weather.

458
00:33:54,234 --> 00:33:55,537
Is that a word?

459
00:33:55,570 --> 00:33:57,371
- Sounds like the word
weather.

460
00:33:57,404 --> 00:33:58,472
- Yeah, I just...

461
00:33:58,506 --> 00:34:02,644
It sounds, starting to
sound like the robot, right?

462
00:34:02,677 --> 00:34:05,412
- I'm sort of tryna do the
numbers,

463
00:34:05,445 --> 00:34:08,382
number crunching over here
so I actually need to focus.

464
00:34:08,415 --> 00:34:09,551
- I didn't come in to talk
about the weather, Adam,

465
00:34:09,584 --> 00:34:12,085
I came here to talk about us.

466
00:34:12,119 --> 00:34:13,387
I didn't come...

467
00:34:14,756 --> 00:34:18,225
Oh, my God, I have literally
no idea what to do.

468
00:34:18,258 --> 00:34:20,260
Can you help? Will you
read some lines in me?

469
00:34:20,294 --> 00:34:22,162
Even just running lines
'cause honestly, at this point

470
00:34:22,195 --> 00:34:25,733
I don't even know if I know any
of them.

471
00:34:25,767 --> 00:34:27,535
Do you mind?

472
00:34:27,569 --> 00:34:28,468
- I've got quite a lot brains of
it.

473
00:34:28,503 --> 00:34:30,605
- Okay, understood.
It's just...

474
00:34:30,638 --> 00:34:31,706
Yeah okay, fine.

475
00:34:31,739 --> 00:34:33,541
- Maybe you should take
this sort of to another room

476
00:34:33,575 --> 00:34:34,709
and I could do the books in here

477
00:34:34,742 --> 00:34:36,376
and then you can have proper-

478
00:34:36,410 --> 00:34:37,745
- Maybe, but I've tried that.

479
00:34:37,779 --> 00:34:40,615
I spent all of last night
doing this like, on my own

480
00:34:40,648 --> 00:34:42,517
and it's really, yeah.

481
00:34:44,418 --> 00:34:45,085
- Go on, go on.

482
00:34:45,118 --> 00:34:46,821
- Oh, thank you, thanks so much.

483
00:34:46,854 --> 00:34:48,322
I wouldn't normally ask,
I completely understand

484
00:34:48,355 --> 00:34:49,857
it's not your job.

485
00:34:49,891 --> 00:34:52,760
- Is your uncle coming back
soon?

486
00:34:52,794 --> 00:34:54,461
- In like, I think in like
two days or something.

487
00:34:54,494 --> 00:34:55,597
- Okay, okay.

488
00:34:55,630 --> 00:34:58,131
- Just 'cause there's been
quite a lot of screaming.

489
00:34:58,165 --> 00:35:01,502
- It's a nightmare situation
for everyone involved.

490
00:35:01,536 --> 00:35:04,505
Yeah, it's
not easy for me either,

491
00:35:04,539 --> 00:35:05,640
so it's just, you know...

492
00:35:05,673 --> 00:35:10,143
I mean, you know who. You
know, it's Idris' ex-wife.

493
00:35:12,513 --> 00:35:13,581
- Oh.
- And she...

494
00:35:13,615 --> 00:35:14,782
I dunno, I think she saw him

495
00:35:14,816 --> 00:35:17,752
and sort of went into a bit
of a tail spin or something.

496
00:35:17,785 --> 00:35:19,453
- Get it away,
get it away, get away.

497
00:35:19,486 --> 00:35:22,289
I can't, I can't deal
with this, just like-

498
00:35:22,322 --> 00:35:23,725
- But this was good, this
is what you wanted to do.

499
00:35:23,758 --> 00:35:24,826
- No, it's not,
it's not, it's not good.

500
00:35:24,859 --> 00:35:27,227
- It was what wanted to
be, you're gonna be writer.

501
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:28,228
I was gonna be a song writer.
- That is...

502
00:35:28,261 --> 00:35:32,232
Listen, why didn't you
tell me your dad died?

503
00:35:39,239 --> 00:35:40,908
I'm sorry about Danny.

504
00:35:46,446 --> 00:35:47,314
I'm sorry.

505
00:35:52,820 --> 00:35:56,924
I'm sorry, it's okay.

506
00:35:58,793 --> 00:36:02,630
I loved Danny.

507
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:16,944
- I'm sorry.
- Danny was like my dad too

508
00:36:16,978 --> 00:36:18,846
and I deserved a call,

509
00:36:22,449 --> 00:36:25,653
and I just had to say that.
- I'm sorry,

510
00:36:26,521 --> 00:36:28,455
I should have called you.

511
00:36:28,488 --> 00:36:31,826
- Yeah, because Danny couldn't
called me.

512
00:36:33,661 --> 00:36:36,597
- Patricia, oh, gimme some of
that.

513
00:36:41,368 --> 00:36:43,838
- Fucking up.

514
00:36:43,871 --> 00:36:45,707
- Did you just drink that?
- Yeah.

515
00:36:45,740 --> 00:36:48,009
- That's not water.
- Oh, no, it's not water.

516
00:36:48,042 --> 00:36:50,712
Okay.

517
00:36:53,413 --> 00:36:55,950
Oh, boy.

518
00:36:59,854 --> 00:37:03,591
- Missed the thing they
had for him as well.

519
00:37:07,895 --> 00:37:11,331
- Well, you know, you have
to do what you had to do.

520
00:37:11,364 --> 00:37:13,366
- Yeah, but I'm never
around in the right place

521
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:15,368
when I'm meant to be, I'm never
in the...

522
00:37:15,402 --> 00:37:17,538
Always in the wrong place.

523
00:37:19,574 --> 00:37:20,975
- That's truthful.

524
00:37:24,011 --> 00:37:25,747
We're so alike.

525
00:37:25,780 --> 00:37:28,916
- Thank you for dealing with all
that.

526
00:37:30,417 --> 00:37:32,285
I never said anything.

527
00:37:37,825 --> 00:37:40,762
He would've been so happy
that you were there.

528
00:37:40,795 --> 00:37:43,598
- He loved me, all right?
He loved me, isn't he?

529
00:37:43,631 --> 00:37:45,432
- He loved you, yeah.

530
00:37:47,568 --> 00:37:48,903
We all loved you.

531
00:37:57,745 --> 00:38:00,581
I started playing this this
morning.

532
00:38:00,615 --> 00:38:03,684

- Keep working.

541
00:38:57,538 --> 00:38:59,874
- I didn't come here to talk
about the weather, Adam.

542
00:38:59,907 --> 00:39:01,609
I didn't come here to talk about
this,

543
00:39:01,642 --> 00:39:04,078
I don't want to talk about it
anymore.

544
00:39:04,111 --> 00:39:07,447
I don't care about the weather,
Adam, I care about you.

545
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:11,519
I care about us. What do
you mean you're leaving me?

546
00:39:11,552 --> 00:39:12,687
That's exactly what I said,

547
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:14,822
what do you mean you're leaving
me?

548
00:39:14,856 --> 00:39:18,125
And today of all days,
I can't stay any longer.

549
00:39:18,159 --> 00:39:19,126
Don't you understand?

550
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:23,396
No, I don't understand.
I thought you loved me.

551
00:39:24,165 --> 00:39:27,501
- Here we go. Whiskey, favourite
drink.

552
00:39:28,870 --> 00:39:30,938
- Now you're just asking for
trouble.

553
00:39:30,972 --> 00:39:33,941
- Oh, I think you brought the
trouble.

554
00:39:34,842 --> 00:39:37,812
Now you, now you are asking for
trouble.

555
00:39:39,213 --> 00:39:41,515
- I don't think it's a good
idea.

556
00:39:41,549 --> 00:39:43,851
- I think it's fucking great
idea.

557
00:39:43,885 --> 00:39:46,087
Come on, cheers.

558
00:40:01,235 --> 00:40:03,838
It's not for the taste, is it?

559
00:40:05,606 --> 00:40:10,611
Are you sure this is okay?

560
00:40:11,078 --> 00:40:13,514
- I don't have any problem
with it, it's just-

561
00:40:13,547 --> 00:40:15,082
- I mean, just don't drive.

562
00:40:23,157 --> 00:40:25,826
- These old miserable bastards!

563
00:40:28,896 --> 00:40:33,034

00:40:50,217 --> 00:40:54,555
Are you lying to Louise?

568
00:40:55,890 --> 00:40:58,893
No, you're actually 45.

569
00:40:58,926 --> 00:41:00,861

571
00:41:05,866 --> 00:41:07,702

everyone that,

573
00:41:09,804 --> 00:41:11,005

effort.

00:41:11,038 --> 00:41:14,909
- No is 50.

575
00:41:14,942 --> 00:41:17,912

576
00:41:17,945 --> 00:41:22,883

Come on, you rigged this.

00:44:17,825 --> 00:44:22,963
You fucking rigged
this, this is ridiculous.

611
00:44:22,997 --> 00:44:25,900
Yes.

You look really beautiful,
by the way.

616
00:44:37,178 --> 00:44:41,148
Oh, fuck, yes, the first time I
saw you

617
00:44:41,182 --> 00:44:42,850
I was kicking in a cigarette
machine.

618
00:44:42,883 --> 00:44:45,853
- This is three, right? There's
three girls on this card.

619
00:44:45,886 --> 00:44:47,922
We've been on,

620
00:44:47,955 --> 00:44:50,491
we've been on, you were
incredibly impressed-

621
00:44:50,525 --> 00:44:54,161
- Charming.
- By my charm, and my moves.

622
00:44:54,195 --> 00:44:56,130
What?

623
00:44:56,163 --> 00:44:57,731
- And you came over and
you said, "Can I help you?"

624
00:44:57,765 --> 00:44:59,333
- Are you talking?

625
00:44:59,366 --> 00:45:02,236

dunno.

626
00:45:03,437 --> 00:45:04,138

00:45:04,171 --> 00:45:06,173
- Yeah, push the button.

628
00:45:06,207 --> 00:45:10,911
You have to put coins in it.

00:45:10,945 --> 00:45:12,213
What are you fucking talking
abut?

630
00:46:48,909 --> 00:46:53,914
We made it.

That was the scariest that I've

00:46:59,286 --> 00:47:04,224
- That was likely, that was
fine. Okay, let got scare her.

637
00:47:12,966 --> 00:47:15,302
She's gonna, she's gonna love it
though.

638
00:47:15,336 --> 00:47:17,371
- She's gonna shut herself.
- Let's scare her.

639
00:47:17,404 --> 00:47:20,240
- No, what if I am a silly
killer.

640
00:47:20,274 --> 00:47:25,012
I mean, I'm, I think I'm
capable of murder. Let's do it.

00:47:29,216 --> 00:47:33,287
Okay, that will fit you.

00:47:44,131 --> 00:47:48,603
Close your eyes,- close your
eyes, I'm getting naked.

647
00:47:48,636 --> 00:47:52,206
Don't come in here.
- Okay, I'll wait here.

648
00:47:57,579 --> 00:48:00,515
- I found some, I found some
paint.

649
00:48:03,183 --> 00:48:06,387
Okay, here you go, this is
cycleboat.

650
00:48:07,388 --> 00:48:09,456

- A ghost.

651
00:48:13,427 --> 00:48:17,264
Okay, you put makeup on me
and I'll put makeup on you.

652
00:48:17,297 --> 00:48:18,365
There you go.

653
00:48:22,369 --> 00:48:25,372
Okay, make me a pretty
ghost.

654
00:48:25,406 --> 00:48:29,076
- Oh, yeah.

655
00:48:30,645 --> 00:48:33,247
- I'll make you an ugly ghost.

656
00:48:48,696 --> 00:48:53,033
Ow, it's a bit
scratchy.

657
00:48:54,569 --> 00:48:55,436
Okay.

658
00:48:57,705 --> 00:49:00,040
- You look like a-
- Don't.

659
00:51:36,296 --> 00:51:38,265
Look at our ghost, his house.

660
00:51:38,298 --> 00:51:40,902
- Oh, yeah.
- We're terrifying.

661
00:51:40,935 --> 00:51:45,272
- Hey, this makes Gary.
- I mean, we're terrifying.

662
00:51:49,242 --> 00:51:50,612
- You smell the same.

663
00:51:50,645 --> 00:51:53,313
- You like me even though I'm
terrifying.

664
00:51:53,347 --> 00:51:55,215
- I could, I get that.

665
00:51:56,316 --> 00:51:59,721
- I'm terrifying.
- No, it went terrifying.

666
00:52:04,491 --> 00:52:07,862
We're haunting this house.

667
00:52:07,895 --> 00:52:09,897
- It's gone just in one.

668
00:52:11,331 --> 00:52:13,534
- Okay, hold on.

669
00:52:21,943 --> 00:52:23,276
Are you ready?

670
00:52:27,515 --> 00:52:28,916
- Oh, really good.

671
00:52:33,353 --> 00:52:34,756
- Wait.

672
00:52:37,792 --> 00:52:42,664
Is she there?
- Yes, she's there.

673
00:52:43,531 --> 00:52:45,833
You look really lovely.
- So do you.

00:52:45,867 --> 00:52:46,968
- D'you think?
- Yeah.

675
00:52:47,001 --> 00:52:48,936

676
00:52:50,370 --> 00:52:52,940
Where are you going? Where are
you going?

677
00:52:56,243 --> 00:52:58,445
Louise, don't be like that,

678
00:52:59,614 --> 00:53:01,883
it's, it just happened to be...

679
00:53:01,916 --> 00:53:04,719
We were just playing
around, having a bit of fun.

680
00:53:04,752 --> 00:53:08,355
Are you not even gonna talk to
us, please?

681
00:53:14,562 --> 00:53:15,429
Hi.

682
00:53:17,765 --> 00:53:18,833
Erm, is it...

683
00:53:19,867 --> 00:53:20,968
I didn't...

684
00:53:21,002 --> 00:53:25,773
Is it 'cause I've had
something to drink?

685
00:53:26,941 --> 00:53:30,210
I got upset and then I just
really...

686
00:53:33,014 --> 00:53:34,916
I love you so much.
- Sh!

687
00:53:36,483 --> 00:53:38,753
- I love you
- Fucking great.

688
00:53:52,633 --> 00:53:55,302

- D'you think?

689
00:53:57,404 --> 00:53:58,606
- I always was.

690
00:54:42,083 --> 00:54:43,551

691
00:54:43,584 --> 00:54:45,987

00:54:53,493 --> 00:54:54,461

696
00:54:54,494 --> 00:54:56,697
I'm eating the balls.

00:54:56,731 --> 00:54:59,432

00:55:04,772 --> 00:55:06,541

00:55:15,983 --> 00:55:18,786

707
00:55:32,767 --> 00:55:35,636

00:55:38,706 --> 00:55:40,908

00:55:43,578 --> 00:55:46,047
- Oh, not much used to you now,

712
00:55:46,080 --> 00:55:49,717

805
01:06:14,776 --> 01:06:19,980
I thought that you
convinced me not to be pregnant

806
01:06:21,248 --> 01:06:23,518

01:06:33,393 --> 01:06:34,529

01:12:02,924 --> 01:12:05,293
I can eat anything, really?

846
01:12:09,530 --> 01:12:12,399
- New guest?
- Something like that.

847
01:12:17,470 --> 01:12:21,776
- Thank you, Louise.

848
01:12:31,886 --> 01:12:32,987
- Bye.

849
01:12:33,020 --> 01:12:34,822
- I'm not very good at goodbyes.

850
01:12:34,856 --> 01:12:37,825
- No, you never were.
- Be good.

851
01:12:37,859 --> 01:12:41,529
- And if you can't be good?
- Be careful.
